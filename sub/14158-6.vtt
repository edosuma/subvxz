00:20.934 --> 00:22.734
*

00:22.834 --> 00:24.500
( screams )

00:24.600 --> 00:26.734
Jonah:
I got sent back from Tonga
to start a new life

00:26.834 --> 00:28.000
and make my family proud.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.267
He said, "Get fucked."

00:29.367 --> 00:31.734
( hip-hop music playing )

00:31.834 --> 00:34.134
Jonah:
My new school,
Holy Cross Catholic School,

00:34.234 --> 00:35.434
is mean as.

00:35.534 --> 00:36.734
( shouting )

00:36.834 --> 00:38.734
Boys, must be the rangas'
heads making it hot.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.967
At school, I got into
a little bit of trouble...

00:42.067 --> 00:42.967
You're too fucking
slow, mate.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.734
Fuck off, Sir.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.267
Mr. Joseph:
Have a look at him.
He's clearly a fuckwit.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.500
I'm clearly a fuckwit.
Sharpest shit out, ay.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.934
...then I did
something stupid

00:50.034 --> 00:51.200
and we all ended up
in juvey.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.067
Moses!
Fuck off me!

01:04.300 --> 01:05.900
All:
Juve-liscious!

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Hey, Miss, guess
what I'm touching right now.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.434
Jonah:
There's a few homos in here...

01:09.534 --> 01:11.934
Why don't you go commit
suicide to yourself?

01:12.034 --> 01:13.334
Because your mom wants
to lick my balls.

01:13.434 --> 01:14.900
She told me when
she came to visit.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.800
...but the guards are nice,
and I love it here.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.867
( boys laughing )

01:19.967 --> 01:21.067
Why did the boy
eat the tampon?

01:21.167 --> 01:22.334
Boys: Why?

01:22.434 --> 01:24.300
'Cause he thought
it was a lolly.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.800
I don't want you
to fucking go.
Jonah!

01:25.900 --> 01:27.567
Therese:
Oh, fuck.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.967
Jonah:
I missed my parole hearing
because I got violent...

01:30.067 --> 01:31.434
( overlapping shouting )

01:31.534 --> 01:33.867
...and now I might not
get out for a long time.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.334
( theme music playing )

01:50.834 --> 01:54.234
( clicking, thuds )

01:54.334 --> 01:56.167
( monkey chatters )

01:58.900 --> 02:00.834
( singing in Tongan )

02:07.734 --> 02:10.200
Jonah:
I want to get out
for lots of reasons.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.100
'Cause I miss school,

02:12.200 --> 02:16.634
I miss Spaz House,
I miss Mr. Joseph
and I miss my boys.

02:16.734 --> 02:19.234
Okay, I'm gonna go
inside with Aunty Grace
and you guys wait here.

02:19.334 --> 02:21.834
Jonah:
And Moses needs me
to look after him

02:21.934 --> 02:24.367
in case he gets bashed.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.400
And I got "Feel Da Beat"
area heats coming up.

02:27.500 --> 02:31.100
So I need to get out
to perform for that.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.367
Manu:
Moses, be careful.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.500
They got electric fences,
you spastic.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.234
You're gonna get
yourself killed.
Fuck up.

02:37.334 --> 02:39.100
Jonah:
'Cause if we win
the area heats,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.567
and we go to the nationals,

02:40.667 --> 02:41.767
and we win that,

02:41.867 --> 02:43.867
then I get to go
to Los Angeles

02:43.967 --> 02:46.500
and that's when I can get
Moses a record deal.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.067
And if I'm good
and responsible

02:50.167 --> 02:52.400
and stay out of trouble
when I get out,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.967
my dad said he's gonna
take me to Tonga

02:55.067 --> 02:57.434
to get my Takalua
tattoo finished,

02:57.534 --> 02:59.334
which means
I'm a real man.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.867
That would be good,
ay, Kevin?

03:03.967 --> 03:05.367
Yeah.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.567
Actually,
I wasn't listening.
It got boring.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.167
No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.467
Not the nuts.
Not the nuts.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.200
Fucking little shit.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.534
*
Boys, the door's open.

03:14.634 --> 03:15.534
I think it's Jonah.

03:15.634 --> 03:16.700
Is it?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.900
Moses:
Oh, no, it's not him.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.134
If Jonah stays in,

03:20.234 --> 03:21.367
I reckon I should
be the new leader

03:21.467 --> 03:23.567
of the crew.

03:23.667 --> 03:24.467
Fuck that.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.967
You're not gonna
be the leader.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.134
I'm gonna be
the leader.
Bullshit.

03:27.234 --> 03:28.367
Bullshit.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.100
Your dick's gonna
be the leader.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.034
You can't even dance.
You can't be the leader

03:32.134 --> 03:33.867
if you can't dance.
That's the rule, bro.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.167
Yeah, that's true.
Fuck up or I'll make
you marry my fist.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.134
Boys, the door!
Someone's coming.

03:39.234 --> 03:41.434
Might be Jonah.
Wait for me.

03:41.534 --> 03:42.900
Manu: It's Jonah.
It's Jonah. It's Jonah.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.567
Moses!

03:44.667 --> 03:46.200
I love you!

03:46.300 --> 03:48.234
Hey, boys.
Fobba-liscious!

03:48.334 --> 03:50.700
( boys cheering )

03:52.567 --> 03:54.867
I missed the fuck
out of you boys.

03:54.967 --> 03:56.267
Israel:
I fucking missed you, bro.

03:57.167 --> 03:58.734
Let's go, boys.

03:58.834 --> 04:01.567
See you, Miss.
Best guard ever!

04:01.667 --> 04:02.400
Love you, Miss.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.000
Good luck
to you, Jonah,

04:04.100 --> 04:06.100
and good luck
in the competition.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.400
I gather this is
Fobba-liscious?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.467
Yeah, these are
my boys, Miss.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.867
Love you, Miss.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.567
See you, Jonah.
Thanks for everything.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.167
Kris:
All right boys, we've got

04:15.267 --> 04:16.567
"Feel Da Beat" to win.
Let's get out of here.

04:16.667 --> 04:17.800
( boys cheering )

04:17.900 --> 04:19.067
Jonah:
Fobba-liscious!

04:19.167 --> 04:21.334
( upbeat music playing )

04:28.067 --> 04:30.234
( chattering )

04:32.534 --> 04:33.700
Manu:
Sir, when are we gonna start?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.134
Here's the running order.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.100
S'up, Sir.
S'up, Sir.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.000
Listen, Jonah, I've been
chatting with your dad.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.567
Did you tell him if you win
this competition

04:41.667 --> 04:43.600
that means you'll be
getting to university?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.834
Yeah.

04:44.934 --> 04:45.834
So you lied to him?

04:45.934 --> 04:46.834
Yeah,
but he's dumb as.

04:46.934 --> 04:47.934
He wouldn't know,

04:48.034 --> 04:49.367
and he really wants
me to go to uni.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.867
Yeah, but it's
not true.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.234
Yeah, well,
it doesn't matter.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.667
I just want him to be
proud if we win, Sir.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.334
All right, look,
we'll talk about it later.

04:55.434 --> 04:56.667
Not cool to lie.
Sir, Sir-- if we win this,

04:56.767 --> 04:59.167
how many more heats
before we go to L.A.?

04:59.267 --> 05:00.267
Look, like I said
before boys,

05:00.367 --> 05:01.567
we have to win
this heat first.

05:01.667 --> 05:02.934
There's a lot more rounds
before we get

05:03.034 --> 05:04.300
to the National Finals.
All right?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.467
Just think about
here and now.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.034
Let's just win
this one, boys.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.367
That's right, exactly.
Let's do it, boys.

05:08.467 --> 05:09.967
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we please get everybody

05:10.067 --> 05:11.134
to their seats.

05:11.234 --> 05:12.667
The show's
about to begin.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.200
Emcee:
Right now I'd like
to welcome you all

05:15.300 --> 05:18.067
to the annual
"Feel Da Beat."

05:18.167 --> 05:20.434
( applause, cheering )

05:21.767 --> 05:23.734
( dance music playing )

05:28.200 --> 05:30.234
All right, all right.
Pink Pearls.

05:30.334 --> 05:34.134
Can we please put our hands
together one more time?

05:34.234 --> 05:36.000
Nice job, girls.
Up next,

05:36.100 --> 05:37.667
we have a group
of Year Nine boys

05:37.767 --> 05:39.167
from Holy Cross High School.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.067
They go by the name
of Fobba-liscious,

05:41.167 --> 05:44.667
they're about to hit the floor
with their anti-bullying anthem

05:44.767 --> 05:46.334
"Don't Be A Bully"!

05:47.967 --> 05:49.067
*

05:49.167 --> 05:50.267
* Don't be a bully

05:50.367 --> 05:53.267
* Fobba-liscious,
listen to us *

05:53.367 --> 05:55.534
All:
* I feel sad,
I feel pain *

05:55.634 --> 05:58.334
* When you call me
that name *

05:58.434 --> 06:03.034
* I'm a person
just like you *

06:03.134 --> 06:04.200
* Don't be a bully

06:04.300 --> 06:06.967
* I feel sad,
I feel pain *

06:07.067 --> 06:10.234
* When you call me
that name *

06:10.334 --> 06:14.300
* I'm a person
just like you *

06:14.400 --> 06:16.267
* Don't be a bully

06:16.367 --> 06:19.167
* Hey, bullies,
listen up *

06:19.267 --> 06:22.500
* Stop walking around
thinking you're so tough *

06:22.600 --> 06:24.634
* Just 'cause a kid's got
a different color hair *

06:24.734 --> 06:27.700
* Don't mean you can be a bully,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

06:27.800 --> 06:30.467
* You're gonna get busted
for calling kids names *

06:30.567 --> 06:32.034
* The teacher's gonna know

06:32.134 --> 06:33.500
* He'll write down
all your names *

06:33.600 --> 06:36.500
* Don't be a bully,
"moolly, moolly" *

06:36.600 --> 06:38.800
* Fobba-liscious,
listen to us *

06:38.900 --> 06:41.234
* I feel said,
I feel pain *

06:41.334 --> 06:44.500
* When you call me
that name *

06:44.600 --> 06:48.767
* I'm a person
just like you *

06:48.867 --> 06:50.300
Jonah:
* Don't be a bully

06:50.400 --> 06:52.600
All:
* I feel said,
I feel pain *

06:52.700 --> 06:56.167
* When you call me
that name *

06:56.267 --> 07:00.234
* I'm a person
just like you *

07:00.334 --> 07:02.367
* Don't be a bully.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.434
( cheering )

07:13.700 --> 07:16.700
Emcee:
And our first runner-up
for this year's "Feel Da Beat,"

07:16.800 --> 07:20.867
we have Grouchy.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.100
( cheering )

07:24.000 --> 07:25.667
That's it, boys.

07:25.767 --> 07:29.234
Okay, and finally the winner
of this year's "Feel Da Beat,"

07:29.334 --> 07:31.534
with a massive effort
and a huge talent,

07:31.634 --> 07:34.300
they're going all the way
to the regional finals--

07:34.400 --> 07:38.467
We have...
the Pink Pearls.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.400
( cheering )

07:40.500 --> 07:43.734
Emcee:
Well done, ladies.
Make some noise.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.467
Well that wraps us up
for this year's "Feel Da Beat."

07:46.567 --> 07:48.267
I want to hear some noise
for all the contestants

07:48.367 --> 07:50.267
here at "Feel Da Beat."

07:50.367 --> 07:51.600
Kris:
Uh, it's a shame.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.567
You know,
it's disappointing.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.967
But they gave it 100% and I'm
really, really proud of them.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.534
They did really awesome.

07:57.634 --> 07:58.734
I just don't want them
to lose confidence,

07:58.834 --> 08:00.300
that's the only thing.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.867
You know, they've done
a lot to come this far.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.167
It's fucked!

08:03.267 --> 08:05.000
It's hard to tell
with these boys.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.600
On the outside
they're really tough

08:06.700 --> 08:08.134
but, especially in times
like this,

08:08.234 --> 08:10.067
they're really quite fragile.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.234
Jonah especially.

08:11.334 --> 08:13.200
It's fucked up, Sir.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.000
Don't hug me,
you look like a homo.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.167
Sir, that sucked.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.167
We were way better
than them.

08:18.267 --> 08:20.234
Sir, you should tell
the judges they fucked up.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.500
Yeah, how am I gonna get
to Los Angeles now, Sir?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.634
Look, it was about
being involved, guys,

08:24.734 --> 08:27.400
and I thought you guys
did incredibly well.
What am I telling my dad?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.167
Don't worry about it.
He'll be all right
for now, okay?

08:29.267 --> 08:30.834
Let's go before I smash
these little girls.

08:30.934 --> 08:32.034
Let's go.

08:32.134 --> 08:33.267
It's going to be
all right, Jonah.

08:33.367 --> 08:34.400
Don't worry about it.
Fucking sucks.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.267
Fuck off, pedo.
Stop touching.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.567
Kris:
Although I wouldn't wish
prison on any kid,

08:38.667 --> 08:40.600
I think that somehow
it's done him some good.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.100
He's come out
a lot more focused

08:42.200 --> 08:43.700
on what he wants to achieve.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.067
And somehow even more
considerate of other people.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.600
Jonah:
We should have won.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.134
It sucks.

08:50.234 --> 08:51.534
Kris:
Well, I made a deal
with Jonah.

08:51.634 --> 08:53.534
I said there'd be
no more counseling sessions

08:53.634 --> 08:55.567
if he's on his best behavior
for a month,

08:55.667 --> 08:58.367
and he seemed pretty keen
to make that happen.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.234
So I think it's going
to be good to see

09:00.334 --> 09:01.900
how well he fits
back in at school.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.134
( funk music playing )

09:08.667 --> 09:09.967
Siana, don't do it.
Don't do it.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.434
Best behavior.

09:13.167 --> 09:14.534
Oi, Pooses.

09:14.634 --> 09:16.300
Hey, Pooses.
You want me
to drop you, cunt?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.300
Jonah!
Do you want me
to take you on?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.234
Kris will make
you do counseling.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.634
Fucking homo.
Fucking pussy.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.500
It's not worth it, dox.
You've gotta be good now.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
Fuck up, ranga.
Kyton:
You're a bitch.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.200
You better run.

09:30.634 --> 09:31.700
Jonah:
Hey, Sister.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.034
Sister, I'm back.

09:33.134 --> 09:34.067
Well, hello, you.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.067
Hey, Sister.

09:35.167 --> 09:36.834
Good to have you back.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.100
I've missed
your little visits.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.600
I've missed you,
too, Sister.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.634
You look good.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.634
It must have been
horrible where you were.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.234
No, it was good.
Just went up
to Queensland.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.967
Dad went up--
he took us all up

09:46.067 --> 09:47.100
and we went to...

09:47.200 --> 09:48.567
What a liar.
...to Movie World.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.400
Manu:
Bullshit, siana.
Sister already knows

09:50.500 --> 09:52.700
that you were in juvey.
Bullshit I went
to juvey.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.134
Why would you go
for six weeks to Movie World?

09:55.234 --> 09:57.134
'Cause we had
to drive up.

09:57.234 --> 09:59.434
We were camping
and we went to Sea World

09:59.534 --> 10:01.134
and Dreamworld, too.
Israel: What a liar.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.567
Don't listen to him,
he's lying.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.500
You do like to tell
a few furphies now and then,

10:04.600 --> 10:06.167
don't you, Jonah?
Jonah: No, I don't

10:06.267 --> 10:07.834
What's a furphy
anyway, Miss?

10:07.934 --> 10:09.767
It sounds like
a fart.

10:09.867 --> 10:10.900
No, it's not
one of those.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.567
I bet you like to do
a few furphies

10:12.667 --> 10:15.167
in here when there's
no one around, Sister.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.300
A furphy is a little tale
we tell sometimes

10:17.400 --> 10:18.767
when we don't want
to tell the truth.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.100
Manu:
That's you, bro.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.467
Sonny:
That's Jonah, that's Jonah.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.600
Sister, can I tell
you a joke?

10:23.700 --> 10:25.467
A clean one, yes.

10:25.567 --> 10:28.467
What did the nun
call her head?

10:28.567 --> 10:29.934
The nunny nun-head.

10:30.034 --> 10:32.034
( boys laughing )

10:32.134 --> 10:33.367
Jonah:
What did the nun do

10:33.467 --> 10:34.834
when she was
in the office
by herself?

10:34.934 --> 10:35.900
What?
A fart.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.700
( boys laughing )

10:37.800 --> 10:38.700
See you, Sister.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.067
I liked the first one better.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.834
Boys:
See you, Sister.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.067
Jonah:
I love you, Sister!

10:43.167 --> 10:46.300
Lovely to have
you back, darling.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.267
Mr. Joseph:
Well, what we got here, boys,
is a pulse.

10:48.367 --> 10:50.067
A current going through
there, on and off.

10:50.167 --> 10:52.067
All right, so that
makes it flash.
( knocking )

10:52.167 --> 10:53.067
Boy:
Jonah's back!

10:53.167 --> 10:54.600
( boys cheering )

10:54.700 --> 10:56.434
Mr. Joseph:
Right-o, shut up, get over here

10:56.534 --> 10:58.534
and watch my demo.
Why so fucking late?

10:58.634 --> 10:59.500
Don't swear, Sir.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.767
You should be happy
to see me.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.234
Right-o, I'm happy
to see you.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.234
Okay, you're back.
But I'm trying to give--

11:04.334 --> 11:06.267
impart some fucking knowledge
here to these numbskulls.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.267
I love you, Sir.
I missed you.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.267
Get the fuck
off me.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.767
Fucking faggot.
Sir!

11:09.867 --> 11:13.600
I've got anger issues.
I'll retaliate on you.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.934
I'm so angry.

11:15.034 --> 11:16.567
I'll have fucking anger issues
in a moment

11:16.667 --> 11:18.434
if you don't pay
a-fucking-ttention.

11:18.534 --> 11:19.700
I'm paying attention.
All right, now--

11:19.800 --> 11:21.934
Teach us something
for once.

11:22.034 --> 11:24.300
Oh, by the way,
shit for brains,

11:24.400 --> 11:27.234
that little
pussycat graffiti--

11:27.334 --> 11:29.000
( boys laughing )

11:29.100 --> 11:30.467
Oh, yeah,
very funny.

11:30.567 --> 11:33.267
Had me walking
all around the school
looking for dicks,

11:33.367 --> 11:34.567
and there you are
drawing pussy.

11:34.667 --> 11:35.967
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:36.067 --> 11:37.367
Who told you, Sir?

11:37.467 --> 11:38.700
Yeah, well, don't try
and change your tag either.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.900
Because I'm too fucking clever
for you, idiot.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.667
My dick's too clever
for you.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.134
I'm not wiping
it off, Sir.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.400
You'll fucking do
as you're told.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.567
Give me a go
of the electricity thing.

11:46.667 --> 11:47.734
No, stay away.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.300
This is dangerous current.
Look at it, look, look.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.067
Your dick's
a dangerous current.
Give me a go.

11:51.167 --> 11:52.067
Ah!
Fuck, Sir.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.600
No swearing.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.467
What have I told you
about swearing in class?

11:55.567 --> 11:56.367
Don't do it.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.200
Right.
Bit fucking weird for my--

11:58.300 --> 11:59.467
They pushed me.
They pushed me.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.667
Did you just--
did you just attack me?

12:01.767 --> 12:04.267
No!
Fuck off.

12:04.367 --> 12:05.800
What about you?
You want some of it?

12:05.900 --> 12:07.500
Fuck off.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.234
Don't electrify me.

12:09.334 --> 12:11.234
Anyone else?
No. Okay, good.

12:11.334 --> 12:12.400
Sir, put 'em
on my nuts.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.000
Put 'em on my nuts.
Oh, fuck.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.834
Do it, Sir. Do it!
Don't tempt me.

12:16.934 --> 12:20.167
( reggae music playing )

12:26.634 --> 12:28.167
Miss Hunt:
One of the finest pieces
I've seen come

12:28.267 --> 12:29.334
out of Year Nine
in a long time.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.200
It's a brilliant sculpture

12:31.300 --> 12:33.300
and it's been chosen
to represent Holy Cross

12:33.400 --> 12:35.200
at the inter-school
Art Prize.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.000
So, Melody, would you
like to come at the front

12:37.100 --> 12:39.134
and explain your work
to the class for me?

12:39.234 --> 12:42.234
Jonah:
One of the shit things about
being in juvey for so long

12:42.334 --> 12:44.800
is Melody, the hot girl
that I like--

12:44.900 --> 12:46.300
she got a boyfriend.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.234
This is a papier-mâché
body cast of my boyfriend.

12:49.334 --> 12:52.134
And my themes are
based on masculinity,

12:52.234 --> 12:55.167
the human form,
and my Tongan heritage.

12:55.267 --> 12:56.400
Miss, Miss.
She ripped me off.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.234
I did one of her,
she copied it.

12:58.334 --> 12:59.234
Miss Hunt:
No calling out, Jonah.

12:59.334 --> 13:00.500
Jonah:
It was my idea.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.767
And you didn't even
finish yours.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.167
It was a big mess.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.200
She's a copyright
ripper-offer.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.467
Miss Hunt:
All right, guys,

13:06.567 --> 13:07.634
so you've all
worked really well--

13:07.734 --> 13:09.967
Stole my ideas,
bitch.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.767
Who's your boyfriend
anyway?

13:11.867 --> 13:13.334
Not telling.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.000
You have to tell me.
I'm your cousin.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.800
I'm not going to,
so sucked in.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.967
You can tell he's got
a small dick

13:19.067 --> 13:20.434
from the bulge
on your sculpture.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.834
Miss told me
to make it small,

13:22.934 --> 13:24.267
so it didn't
offend people.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.200
It's actually massive
in real life.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.634
Oh, that's disgusting.
How do you even know?

13:29.734 --> 13:31.200
Did he show you?
Yeah, Jonah.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.400
It's called
having a boyfriend.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.234
Why don't you
go marry him then?

13:35.334 --> 13:37.100
That's a cool insult,

13:37.200 --> 13:38.334
because maybe
I will one day.

13:38.434 --> 13:40.000
He's way hotter
than you.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.834
Your face is hotter
than me.

13:42.934 --> 13:43.900
Um, I know.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.267
Shut up.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.800
You sound like
an idiot.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.734
Jonah:
But, one of the best things

13:48.834 --> 13:50.300
about coming out of juvey

13:50.400 --> 13:52.700
is that everyone
thinks you're a gangster.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.034
How you doing?
Jonah: Rangas...

13:54.134 --> 13:55.967
Like, even the rangas,

13:56.067 --> 13:57.267
they think I'm
a school legend now

13:57.367 --> 13:58.567
because I've been
to juvey.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.234
I was on kitchen duty,

14:00.334 --> 14:02.434
and I wanted to--
I wanted to get a knife.

14:02.534 --> 14:04.100
But the knife drawer,
they keep it locked,

14:04.200 --> 14:06.967
so I carved a knife
out of a carrot.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.434
A carrot?
Yeah.

14:08.534 --> 14:10.834
A carrot.
And it was a frozen carrot

14:10.934 --> 14:12.467
and so it had
a really sharp point.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.934
And then, when the guard
walked past,

14:14.034 --> 14:15.734
I pushed him
up against the wall--

14:15.834 --> 14:16.734
this abo guard--

14:16.834 --> 14:18.000
and I cut--
you know that bit

14:18.100 --> 14:19.567
of your ear,
the flippy bit?

14:19.667 --> 14:22.634
I cut that bit off
and it started bleeding,

14:22.734 --> 14:24.634
and he bled so much
that he almost died

14:24.734 --> 14:27.067
but he survived.
They stitched it back on.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.500
Tyler:
That's legendary, mate.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.567
Yeah, I was
the biggest legend
in prison.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.234
Jonah:
And even though I'm
getting along with the rangas,

14:32.334 --> 14:33.767
I still hate Graydon.

14:33.867 --> 14:38.200
Jonah, Graydon wants
you teaching him break dancing.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.500
Fuck off.
As if.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.434
And I hate Graydon
even more now,

14:41.534 --> 14:43.234
'cause he's going out
with my fat sister.

14:43.334 --> 14:45.167
Show me some of the moves
that you learnt in jail, dude.

14:45.267 --> 14:46.567
I didn't learn anything.

14:46.667 --> 14:47.934
What are you going out
with my fat sister for?

14:48.034 --> 14:49.300
You're sick.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.867
Don't call her fat, mate.
I really like her.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.234
I really like her, dude.

14:52.334 --> 14:53.267
Just teach him
moves, Jonah.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.534
Jonah, you and me
brothers, man.

14:54.634 --> 14:55.734
I'm not gonna have
a ranga brother,

14:55.834 --> 14:57.200
so that's not happening.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.600
I'm pretty keen to have
a juvey gangster as a brother.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.434
So teach me
some shit, man.
Come on.

15:00.534 --> 15:02.234
Mary:
Come on, Jonah.
He's family now.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.367
Just one move, man.
Come on.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.134
Jonah:
Teach your dick a move.

15:05.234 --> 15:06.400
I'm not showing
you shit.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.700
Mate, how do you
do this move, right?

15:07.800 --> 15:08.667
I saw you do it
the other day.

15:08.767 --> 15:09.867
You can't do it.

15:09.967 --> 15:10.900
With the knees
and you spin around.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.234
Jonah:
You can't do it.

15:12.334 --> 15:14.167
You look like a spastic.
Teach me, mate.

15:14.267 --> 15:16.167
You gotta lead
into it.

15:16.267 --> 15:18.200
You gotta do that.
And then you go down.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.767
And then you go around.
And then, boom.

15:20.867 --> 15:24.067
So how do I go down? Like--
Nah, you can't do it.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.200
Don't touch me, ranga.
Girl: Bye, Miss.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.467
Okay, bye-bye, girls.
See you later.
Jonah:
They're all fucking gay boys.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.134
Jonah:
Some things have changed,

15:30.234 --> 15:32.567
and some things are not
as good as they were.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.434
Bye, Miss.

15:33.534 --> 15:34.934
See you, Miss.
Bye-bye, boys.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.400
See you later.
See you.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.600
What the fuck?
( car playing loud music )

15:38.700 --> 15:41.200
Jonah:
Melody, she's getting
in George's car.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.500
Jonah, Melody is
going out with George.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.800
Yeah.
We didn't want
to tell you.

15:43.900 --> 15:44.900
Sorry, man.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.167
He stole her
from you easily.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.334
Jonah:
Melody! Melody!

15:49.434 --> 15:51.067
Is he the papier-mâché thing?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.267
Yeah.

15:52.367 --> 15:53.534
Jonah:
Well, guess what?

15:53.634 --> 15:55.167
I'm going out
with Miss Hunt now.

15:55.267 --> 15:56.467
We're lovers.
Get off.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.134
Me and Miss Hunt
are going out.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.000
She sucks me off better
than you ever could.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.534
Jonah, that is
disgusting.

16:01.634 --> 16:02.400
Go home!

16:02.500 --> 16:03.834
Sorry, Miss.
I was only joking.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.100
Sonny:
We were just joking, Miss.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.067
Manu:
So sorry, man.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.500
( upbeat music playing )

16:14.034 --> 16:16.600
( boys talking )
( sniffles )

16:16.700 --> 16:18.467
Sir, what's happening?
Why is all our shit outside?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.167
Sir, are we
moving classrooms?

16:20.267 --> 16:21.967
Jonah:
What the fuck, Sir?
Why you taking our shit?

16:22.067 --> 16:24.067
Right-o, just--
Now you blokes are all here.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.967
Just gather round,
I'll-- I'll let you know

16:27.067 --> 16:28.100
what's going on.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.400
Are you punking
us, Sir?

16:29.500 --> 16:32.000
No, mate, I'm not.
This is for real.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.634
( clears throat )
So...

16:34.734 --> 16:35.800
( sighs )

16:35.900 --> 16:37.267
I've known
for a little while

16:37.367 --> 16:38.967
but I didn't want
to worry you blokes.

16:39.067 --> 16:41.567
The Catholic Education Office

16:41.667 --> 16:45.634
has deemed that Lazarus House
is unsatisfactory.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.834
And it seems
that I'm of no benefit,

16:47.934 --> 16:50.000
so they've decided
to close us down

16:50.100 --> 16:51.300
after nine years.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.934
Israel:
That's fucking shit, Sir.

16:53.034 --> 16:54.567
Are you serious?

16:54.667 --> 16:57.167
( sighs )
Today's my last day
at Holy Cross.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.200
What about us, Sir?
You can't leave us.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.967
Manu:
What's gonna
happen to us?

17:01.067 --> 17:03.734
You blokes will be integrated
back into the normal classes.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.700
You'll still be able
to do your TVET subjects,

17:05.800 --> 17:07.000
so don't worry
about that.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.067
You'll just be doing
them with everyone else.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.167
It's-- it's all sorted.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.467
That's shit as, Sir.
We can't be in normal classes.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.867
We're too disruptive
to other students.

17:15.967 --> 17:19.234
Are you definitely
not bullshitting us?

17:19.334 --> 17:20.700
No, mate.
It's not bullshit.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.067
This is my last day.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.167
When I leave here,
that's the end of it.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.534
You won't see
me again.

17:24.634 --> 17:26.167
Manu:
He's serious boys.
We're fucked.

17:26.267 --> 17:27.600
That's fucked, Sir.
We love you too much.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.967
We want you
to stay.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.367
Yeah, let's not
get too gay about this.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.834
We're just going to...
say goodbye

17:32.934 --> 17:36.334
in a manly fashion
with a handshake.

17:36.434 --> 17:37.734
Boys, let's sing
a song for Sir.

17:37.834 --> 17:39.067
Yeah.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.867
Come on, boys.
"Alu a koe."

17:40.967 --> 17:42.767
What's that?

17:42.867 --> 17:44.200
It's a traditional
farewell song.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.734
We sing it when
someone goes away.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.467
Yeah.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.567
( strumming )

17:52.934 --> 17:55.134
( boys singing
in Tongan )

18:32.434 --> 18:34.034
( grunts )

18:34.134 --> 18:37.300
Fucking shit.
Don't get me, Sir.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.834
I won't miss that shit.
We're trying to sing.
Shut up, Sir.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.867
( singing continues )

18:45.934 --> 18:48.634
Kris:
Can I get the Lazarus House
boys to your feet, please?

18:48.734 --> 18:51.067
As of Monday, these boys
will be integrated

18:51.167 --> 18:53.200
back into normal classes,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.900
as Lazarus House
will be closing.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.200
If you happen to see them
in your classes,

18:57.300 --> 18:59.134
please make them
feel welcome.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.134
It's not an easy transition
for them.

19:01.234 --> 19:03.567
So please reach out,
be as warm and considerate

19:03.667 --> 19:04.834
as you can be.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.934
Thanks very much, guys.
Take a seat.

19:07.034 --> 19:09.667
Could I see Jonah, Manu,
Israel, Sonny--

19:09.767 --> 19:12.534
and where's Moses Takalua?

19:12.634 --> 19:14.200
Come up here, Moses.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.534
You guys, come join me
at the front please.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.934
Now, last weekend
these boys competed

19:23.034 --> 19:24.867
in the "Feel Da Beat"
talent competition

19:24.967 --> 19:27.967
and they performed their
original anti-bullying song,

19:28.067 --> 19:29.667
"Don't Be a Bully."

19:29.767 --> 19:33.100
Now, they put in
a massive effort
to write this song

19:33.200 --> 19:36.567
and rehearsed despite
being split up for some time.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.134
They also put 100%
into their performance

19:39.234 --> 19:41.134
and I was
extremely proud.

19:41.234 --> 19:43.434
Now, these guys didn't win,

19:43.534 --> 19:45.834
but that's life.
It's what happens sometimes.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.367
But what I wanted to do
was to read out something

19:48.467 --> 19:50.367
in reference
to these boys--

19:50.467 --> 19:53.334
a quote from
the great Nelson Mandela.

19:56.167 --> 19:59.434
"We ask ourselves,
who am I to be brilliant,

19:59.534 --> 20:03.267
gorgeous, talented,
and fabulous?

20:03.367 --> 20:06.400
Actually, who are you
not to be?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.634
We were born to manifest
the glory of God

20:08.734 --> 20:10.500
that is within us.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.834
It's not just in some of us.
It's in everyone.

20:13.934 --> 20:16.300
And as we let
our own light shine,

20:16.400 --> 20:19.000
we unconsciously give
people permission

20:19.100 --> 20:21.867
to do the same."

20:21.967 --> 20:26.600
Now, despite what you guys
might think of yourselves
right now,

20:26.700 --> 20:30.534
I believe that you are
genuinely, incredibly brave,

20:30.634 --> 20:34.767
wonderfully talented,
generous, and loving boys

20:34.867 --> 20:36.267
that I'm honored
to know.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.200
Keep striving
for your best

20:38.300 --> 20:40.100
and keep letting
your light shine.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.567
You should be extremely proud
of what you've achieved
this term.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.567
Thank you, Sir.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.634
( applause )

20:59.067 --> 21:01.400
( kids cheering )

21:02.600 --> 21:04.334
Jonah:
This term's been gun as.

21:04.434 --> 21:07.067
Me and the Fobba-liscious boys,
we dominate the playground

21:07.167 --> 21:08.667
more than ever before.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.900
We're still the sickest cunts
in the whole school.

21:11.000 --> 21:11.867
Boys,
Fobba-liscious.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.067
All:
Fobba-liscious.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.600
Boys, where's
my moisturizer?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.434
And it's good because
Mr. Joseph's gone,

21:16.534 --> 21:18.967
now I can do
my "dicktation" tag.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.700
I've been doing it everywhere
and I don't even get busted.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.100
And I've been telling
some teachers that Graydon

21:25.200 --> 21:26.767
has been getting
into tagging lately

21:26.867 --> 21:28.767
and to look out
for dicks.

21:28.867 --> 21:31.234
You know Graydon?
I saw him running
out of the toilets before.

21:31.334 --> 21:32.500
and he looked
really guilty

21:32.600 --> 21:33.967
I think he had black
ink on his hands.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.034
Did you boys see that?
All: Yeah.

21:35.134 --> 21:36.000
Jonah:
Hey, Sister Monica?

21:36.100 --> 21:37.500
Sonny:
Go, go now.

21:39.234 --> 21:40.900
( groans )
Fuck, Sister.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.567
I fucked my leg.

21:42.667 --> 21:43.734
Only joking!

21:43.834 --> 21:44.934
I didn't.
( laughing )

21:45.034 --> 21:46.734
Yeah!

21:46.834 --> 21:48.434
Got you, Sister!

21:48.534 --> 21:50.734
Sucked in.
Sorry for swearing.
Sister!

21:50.834 --> 21:52.434
Jonah:
I miss Mr. Joseph a lot

21:52.534 --> 21:54.134
but being
in normal class is good

21:54.234 --> 21:56.234
because we get
to do science,

21:56.334 --> 21:58.967
and my favorite subject
in science is astronomy.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.000
Sir, what page?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.567
What page?
144.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.200
My very easy memory--

22:03.300 --> 22:04.967
Sir, what planet
is this one?

22:05.067 --> 22:06.000
The one with
the crater.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.367
One moment, Jonah.

22:07.467 --> 22:09.134
Can you get
a stiffy in space, Sir?

22:09.234 --> 22:11.100
Jonah:
The other day, we got
to go on an excursion

22:11.200 --> 22:12.534
to this telescope place.

22:12.634 --> 22:15.200
And we got to see
galaxies and shit

22:15.300 --> 22:18.067
and I asked Sir
some really good questions.

22:18.167 --> 22:20.200
There's the Milky Way
and shit.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.034
Yeah, it's a most
amazing thing--

22:22.134 --> 22:23.900
Fuck. I think
I just saw a comet, Sir.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.234
Is there a comet?
I saw a comet.

22:25.334 --> 22:26.900
Uh, you might have.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.067
Sir, how come
I can't see Tonga?

22:30.167 --> 22:32.800
Well, it's not in space.
Is it, Jonah?
Oh, yeah.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.600
Jonah:
And in our class,
if you're really good

22:34.700 --> 22:37.500
at astronomy
then you get to go up.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.134
Sir picks you to go up
and look at the models.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.867
I'm really good
at astronomy,

22:41.967 --> 22:43.200
but Sir never picks me.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.634
Teacher:
I'll need a volunteer.

22:44.734 --> 22:45.867
Sir, pick me, please!

22:45.967 --> 22:46.867
Sir, please!

22:46.967 --> 22:48.334
( boys shouting )

22:48.434 --> 22:49.834
Uh, Tristan,
come up here.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.434
Fucking homo.
Fuck.

22:51.534 --> 22:53.667
Jonah:
And there's a competition for--

22:53.767 --> 22:57.334
They're picking one kid
in Western Sydney
to go to NASA,

22:57.434 --> 23:00.467
which is in America,
to see spaceships and shit

23:00.567 --> 23:02.334
if you're really good
at astronomy.

23:02.434 --> 23:04.467
And so if I'm really good
at astronomy

23:04.567 --> 23:06.534
and I win that trip,
then when I'm over there

23:06.634 --> 23:08.067
I'm gonna get
a record deal for Moses

23:08.167 --> 23:09.300
while I'm there.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.734
Sir, I want to show
you some stuff.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.134
I want to name
all the planets.

23:12.234 --> 23:13.834
Jonah:
Sir, I know them.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.634
Mars... Jupiter...

23:16.734 --> 23:17.767
What's the other one?

23:17.867 --> 23:18.867
Uranus.

23:18.967 --> 23:20.567
Uran--
( laughing )

23:20.667 --> 23:22.134
He said Uranus!
Sir!

23:22.234 --> 23:23.600
Sir, he said Uranus.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.367
Uranus is one
of the planet things.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.100
Sir, has a man ever landed
on Uranus?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.634
( laughing )

23:28.734 --> 23:30.500
No interruptions.
Others are trying to learn.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.000
Sir, has a dick ever
been up Uranus?

23:33.100 --> 23:34.167
( laughing )

23:34.267 --> 23:36.100
Teacher:
That's Jupiter--

23:36.200 --> 23:38.500
Sir... Sir...
um...

23:38.600 --> 23:40.067
Do men like Uranus?

23:40.167 --> 23:41.934
( laughing )

23:42.034 --> 23:43.734
Go to the rugby one.

23:43.834 --> 23:44.900
Jonah:
Oh, that's it.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.134
Jonah:
Home's good, too.

23:46.234 --> 23:48.034
I've been doing
all my homework,

23:48.134 --> 23:49.767
I've been really good.

23:49.867 --> 23:51.200
I got new
school shoes, too.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.467
These are my new shoes
that my dad got me.

23:53.567 --> 23:54.367
They're much better.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.134
More responsible shoes.

23:56.234 --> 23:57.534
Look at this kid.

23:57.634 --> 23:59.300
Jonah:
And I even did
my own art assignment

23:59.400 --> 24:01.900
that I made up.
I made sculptures.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.267
I papier-mâchéd
Sister Monica's arm,

24:04.367 --> 24:06.534
and I even
papier-mâchéd my dick.

24:06.634 --> 24:09.300
I keep 'em
on the mantelpiece.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.967
Everybody, dinner is ready.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.334
Go back.
Go back.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.900
Rocky:
Hey, come on.
Let's eat.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.434
Dinner time, shit head.

24:15.534 --> 24:17.834
Don't eat it.
You're fat enough already.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.234
Eat my shit.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.900
Eat my shit with
a knife and fork

24:21.000 --> 24:22.534
and put it in
your mouth, bitch.

24:22.634 --> 24:25.234
Jonah:
And another thing,
Moses got a laptop

24:25.334 --> 24:27.367
'cause of his
learning difficulties,
from school.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.667
And it's gun as
because me and Moses,

24:30.767 --> 24:34.967
we photoshopped some photos
of my head onto some other ones

24:35.067 --> 24:35.967
to trick my dad.

24:36.067 --> 24:37.367
Hey, Dad,
come check this out.

24:37.467 --> 24:39.300
Jonah: And now,
because of the fake photos,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.100
my dad thinks that I'm
captain of the rugby team,

24:42.200 --> 24:43.834
Dux of Year Nine,

24:43.934 --> 24:46.334
president of the SRC,

24:46.434 --> 24:48.067
and assistant
to the priests.

24:48.167 --> 24:49.500
This is
the science award.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.834
This is all the best
science kids in school--

24:51.934 --> 24:53.000
me and this boy.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.200
I'm so proud
of you, mate.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.567
Jonah:
But the best thing of all,

24:57.667 --> 24:59.534
is because my dad thinks
I'm all responsible now,

24:59.634 --> 25:03.067
he's taking me to Tonga
to get my Takalua tattoo
finished.

25:03.167 --> 25:05.700
He thinks I'm
a real man now.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.800
( reggae music playing )

25:11.967 --> 25:14.100
Hi, everyone at Holy Cross.
This is a video of my brother

25:14.200 --> 25:16.234
Jonah in Tonga getting
his tattoo finished.

25:16.334 --> 25:17.867
As you can see,
he's being a bit of a pussy.

25:17.967 --> 25:19.734
( tattoo gun buzzing )
Ow, that kills.

25:19.834 --> 25:20.767
Moses:
Don't cry, you pussy.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.467
Fuck off.
Piss off.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.134
Say something.
I don't want to be filmed.

25:24.234 --> 25:25.567
Move the camera
away from me.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.367
Moses:
Just say it to everyone
at school.

25:27.467 --> 25:29.034
I don't want to be filmed.
It hurts like a motherfucker.

25:29.134 --> 25:32.267
Stop swearing.
Respect your uncle,

25:32.367 --> 25:34.067
or I will smack
your asshole.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.534
It fucking hurts.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.100
I mean, it pucking hurts.
It's not a swear word.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.467
Ah!
Fuck!

25:38.567 --> 25:40.700
What did you do that for,
you fucking homo?

25:40.800 --> 25:41.700
( speaking Tongan )

25:41.800 --> 25:43.500
It kills.
Dickheads.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.334
Cousin Aisi:
It's to take your mind
off your tattoo.

25:45.434 --> 25:47.100
Your balls hurt
more than your arms.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.267
( laughing )
Fuck off.

25:50.367 --> 25:51.534
Is it nearly over?

25:51.634 --> 25:52.800
( speaking Tongan )

25:52.900 --> 25:54.034
It's almost done.

25:54.134 --> 25:55.600
Moses:
All right, now,
just say something

25:55.700 --> 25:57.267
to everyone at school
before you're finished.

25:57.367 --> 25:59.200
Hi, everyone at Holy Cross.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.934
Hi, Sister Monica.
Hi, Kool Kris.

26:01.034 --> 26:04.034
Um, this is me getting
my Takalua tattoo,

26:04.134 --> 26:06.934
and when it's finished
I'm gonna be a real man.

26:07.034 --> 26:07.967
Cut.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.100
Moses: Okay.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.400
( speaking Tongan )

26:10.500 --> 26:12.300
Cousin Aisi:
It's finished.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.234
Oh, it's finished.
( laughs )

26:14.334 --> 26:16.167
Oh, it looks gun as.

26:16.267 --> 26:17.534
Give us a look.

26:17.634 --> 26:18.500
It looks like a dick.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.634
Oh...

26:19.734 --> 26:21.400
( Moses laughing )
It looks like a dick!

26:21.500 --> 26:24.067
That looks gay as.
It means you're
a real man now, son.

26:24.167 --> 26:26.000
You got the real
Takalua tattoo.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.200
But it looks gay!

26:27.300 --> 26:28.334
That's what fathers
gives to their son

26:28.434 --> 26:29.667
when they're ready
to become a man.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.900
I don't want
this tattoo.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.267
Don't laugh.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.967
At least
I've got tattoos.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.167
You're a little pussy.

26:35.267 --> 26:37.934
You see,
Aisi got one,

26:38.034 --> 26:40.900
your Uncle Mamafu
got one,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.034
and I got one, too.
See?

26:43.134 --> 26:44.534
Oh, yuck!

26:44.634 --> 26:46.867
You didn't tell me
you had a dick on your ass.

26:46.967 --> 26:48.067
That's disgusting.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.334
Yes, son.

26:49.434 --> 26:51.167
I don't want
to have a dick on me.

26:51.267 --> 26:54.167
You got a dick on you.
We all do.

26:56.067 --> 27:00.434
Jonah...
( speaking Tongan )

27:00.534 --> 27:03.434
All Takaluas
have a dick on them.

27:05.367 --> 27:07.834
Rocky:
That's a Takalua style.

27:07.934 --> 27:10.034
I like it.

27:10.134 --> 27:11.967
It looks good.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.700
Rocky:
I love you son.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.134
I love you too, Dad.
*

27:16.234 --> 27:17.467
Ah, fuck.
Careful.

27:17.567 --> 27:18.967
Ooh, sorry.
Sorry.
( Moses laughs )

27:19.067 --> 27:19.967
Sorry.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.334
Hey, Moses,

27:21.434 --> 27:23.200
one day you'll have
a dick on you, too.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.134
You will!
No!

27:25.234 --> 27:28.234
Dad, thanks for letting
me get my tattoo.

27:28.334 --> 27:30.267
No, no worries.
I told you-- ow!

27:30.367 --> 27:32.334
You fucking little shit!

27:33.934 --> 27:35.100
I'm gonna get you...

27:35.200 --> 27:36.534
( shouting )

27:47.900 --> 27:50.634
( theme music playing )
