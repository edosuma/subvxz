WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.700
I'm gonna go to Omaha because...

00:02.700 --> 00:04.320
I'm gonna run
for president again.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.570
In terms of the library...

00:05.990 --> 00:07.200
We heard back from Yale. - Oh!

00:07.530 --> 00:08.910
Their response was no.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.200
Leon West is
on CBS This Morning right now.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.240
Freeing Tibet was
a monumental achievement.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
Yes, it was.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.570
That was a success despite an almost
pathological level of incompetence...

00:17.570 --> 00:19.490
Her biased discretion
speaks well of her.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.910
- You look absolutely radiant.
- Oh, thank you!

00:21.910 --> 00:23.740
Yes. Your stay
in the insane asylum,

00:23.740 --> 00:25.530
- it's really agreed with you.
- Oh. It was a spa.

00:25.530 --> 00:28.070
So what do you think? Three
Meyer-sketeers hang a shingle?

00:28.070 --> 00:30.450
Jonah! I'm pulling all
my financial support.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.160
I am pulling this creature
right off

00:33.160 --> 00:35.610
the congressional ballot
and replacing him

00:35.610 --> 00:37.200
- with his cousin Ezra.
- What?!

00:37.200 --> 00:38.410
Goodbye, Jonah.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.450
Guess who is interested in the
Selina Meyer Presidential Library?

00:41.450 --> 00:42.530
- Shit! It's Hop!
- It's Andrew.

00:42.530 --> 00:44.570
No, Yale!

00:51.570 --> 00:53.740
And from the heady days

00:53.740 --> 00:56.700
of our third-place finish
in Iowa,

00:56.700 --> 00:59.450
we fought together for the dream

00:59.450 --> 01:02.950
of becoming the first
woman president.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.319
Whoo!

01:05.319 --> 01:08.320
But tonight...
Tonight, the voters

01:08.320 --> 01:12.070
of Illinois, Missouri,
North Carolina...

01:12.070 --> 01:15.820
Ohio, Florida, Texas,
and the territory of Guam

01:15.820 --> 01:17.700
have said otherwise.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.570
- God, I really thought we were gonna win Guam.
- And so, ahem...

01:20.570 --> 01:24.660
- I have decided to suspend my campai...
- No!

01:24.660 --> 01:28.490
No! Yes, I've decided
to suspend my campaign.

01:28.490 --> 01:31.200
Jesus, I need to get drunk
and slop-fuck an intern.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.950
I'm really sorry that I could not
carry this one over the finish line

01:35.950 --> 01:39.320
for all of you. - ♪ And we can
build this thing together... ♪

01:39.320 --> 01:42.490
- And as... oh, my. Wow.
- ♪ Standing strong forever... ♪

01:42.490 --> 01:45.320
As devastating as
this loss may be,

01:45.320 --> 01:49.410
you have not seen
the last of Selina Meyer.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.030
Selina for you.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.780
Selina for you!

01:56.860 --> 01:59.360
Jonie, look,
I have a special treat.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.780
- Hello, former Congressman Ryan.
- Oh, come on!

02:01.780 --> 02:03.360
- Richard.
- What are you even doing here?

02:03.360 --> 02:05.360
Well, your mom said you
could use some Splett pep,

02:05.360 --> 02:06.700
so I brought you this.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.070
See, the box is empty

02:10.070 --> 02:12.160
to show that all you need
to be happy is right here.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.820
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah, it was a waste of $30.

02:14.820 --> 02:16.700
Look, save your pity, Richard.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.280
In two years, I'm gonna run
against my motard cousin, Ezra,

02:19.280 --> 02:21.410
who's been a congressman
for, like, two days

02:21.410 --> 02:23.530
and he's already passed,
like, 10 bills.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.490
Well, two years is a long time.

02:25.490 --> 02:27.320
I mean, you could
petition for a recall

02:27.320 --> 02:28.780
if they weren't
unconstitutional.

02:28.780 --> 02:30.820
Can I petition for
a recall against Ezra?

02:30.820 --> 02:32.450
- Unequivocally, no.
- That's a great idea.

02:32.450 --> 02:34.360
- That's awesome.
- Well, it was nice to see you.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.070
I guess I'll see myself out.

02:36.070 --> 02:38.030
Well,

02:38.030 --> 02:40.740
I don't know,
as long as you're here...

02:40.740 --> 02:41.990
you wanna play?

02:41.990 --> 02:43.860
I'll let you be Aquaman.
No tidal wave.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.320
Does a rabbit need a yearly
vaccination for myxomatosis?

02:46.320 --> 02:48.570
It does. Well, maybe.
It depends on the rabbit.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.070
- But, yes.
- Mom, can Richard stay the night?

02:51.070 --> 02:54.030
- Can I please, Mrs. Ryan?
- Oh, sure! I'll make waffles for breakfast.

02:54.030 --> 02:57.780
- Mom, I don't want waffles!
- Okay, then I won't make waffles.

02:57.780 --> 03:00.950
Happy six month
anniversary, my love.

03:00.950 --> 03:04.200
- This belonged to my great-grandmother.
- Oh, my God.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.910
My great-grandfather
bought it for her

03:05.910 --> 03:08.240
with the money he made from
his first major arms deal.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.280
Wow. Well, we'll have to
see what I look like later

03:11.280 --> 03:13.070
wearing nothing
but blood diamonds.

03:13.070 --> 03:15.280
Selina.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.780
- Here she comes.
- Madam President!

03:16.780 --> 03:18.780
Madam President, Ambassador,
are you two engaged yet?

03:18.780 --> 03:20.320
- Hey, guys.
- It's the woman who freed Tibet!

03:20.320 --> 03:22.030
Montez's numbers are tanking.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.530
Is she gonna have to give up
her Nobel Peace Prize?

03:23.530 --> 03:25.950
How come you never talk
about your stay in Arizona?

03:25.950 --> 03:28.530
Oh, I love the Grand Canyon.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.200
- That's not an answer.
- Look over here!

03:30.200 --> 03:32.280
- Arizona?
- Yeah, it was a spa. It was just a spa.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.320
- It's really nice.
- Hey! Whoo!

03:38.320 --> 03:41.110
- Hey, lookie, lookie!
- Hi!

03:41.110 --> 03:44.990
Here she is, the most
beautiful woman in the spa.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.820
- Hi, Mom!
- Watch your toesies, watch your toesies.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.240
- Hey, baby!
- Hi!

03:48.240 --> 03:49.700
- Boop-boop!
- Hello, ma'am.

03:49.700 --> 03:50.990
- Marjorie.
- Marjorie.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.360
- Lovely to see you.
- Hi.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.490
Yes, I'm gonna make you
look pretty, okay?

03:54.490 --> 03:55.950
What's new?

03:55.950 --> 03:58.200
- You were here yesterday.
- That's right!

03:58.200 --> 04:00.820
They love you so much,
they can't keep away.

04:00.820 --> 04:02.820
Ma'am, that was a month ago.
Gary is humoring you.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.530
Okay. - Gary, are you sure that
this isn't too much medication?

04:06.530 --> 04:08.860
- People think we're married.
- I think it's the perfect amount.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.360
How often are you visiting?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.740
- Oh, like, twice a day.
- A lot.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.320
But not as much as I would like.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.160
I got a place
about three hours away.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.410
Mom, how are you feeling?

04:16.410 --> 04:18.740
- Losing was just the best.
- Aw.

04:18.740 --> 04:19.910
- Yes, it was.
- Really?

04:19.910 --> 04:21.990
Because politics
has a sickness...

04:21.990 --> 04:23.410
That's right, that's right.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.820
- Catherine.
- That's right.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.950
- And it's sick.
- How about some lipstick?

04:26.950 --> 04:28.860
- It's so amazing to hear you say that.
- Yeah.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.700
Mom, we were thinking that maybe
when you're feeling all better,

04:31.700 --> 04:33.700
that maybe you could
come live with us.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.280
- Yes, Mom.
- Oh, isn't that nice?

04:35.280 --> 04:38.200
You're beautiful. Catherine,
you are truly beautiful.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.700
- I'll have what she's having.
- You're beautiful.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.160
- Mom, we have a surprise for you!
- Knock-knock!

04:43.160 --> 04:45.490
Oh. As soon as I heard

04:45.490 --> 04:46.990
what a vulnerable state
you were in,

04:46.990 --> 04:48.860
- I got on the first flight.
- Hi, Andrew.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.700
Okay, I'm gonna get the
orderly with the big needles.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.820
- Let's not do that.
- You look beautiful.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.700
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.660
That, uh...

05:03.490 --> 05:05.160
Leon West will not
let this spa thing go.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.910
He's like a bald dog
with a bone.

05:06.910 --> 05:09.660
Well, ma'am, a buddy of mine
works at the "Post" snack shop.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.700
- He says Leon's on the outs.
- Really?

05:11.700 --> 05:14.070
The editors think he's lost
all sense of objectivity,

05:14.070 --> 05:16.820
and he's eating
Luna bars for women.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.740
- Okay, see? He's unhinged!
- Mm-hmm.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.240
He's like this demented creep

05:21.240 --> 05:23.070
who follows me around...

05:23.070 --> 05:24.990
and gets all in my personal life

05:24.990 --> 05:27.320
and thinks about me
24-7, nonstop.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.030
- Cuckoo!
- Yeah.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.200
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

05:31.200 --> 05:35.070
They dropped off the final model for
the library. - Oh, wow! Look at this!

05:35.070 --> 05:36.780
- Oh, my goodness!
- Look at this.

05:36.780 --> 05:40.070
- So they solved the design problem.
- Yes.

05:40.070 --> 05:44.910
And so now the staircase goes right up
and smashes through the glass ceiling.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.410
Exactly what it's like
to be a woman.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.780
Yes, and they're working
on the engineering.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.240
They said
it's a little unstable.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.070
Yeah, also what it's like
to be a woman.

05:51.070 --> 05:53.070
Lookit, Marjorie!
What do you think?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.740
It looks like a vagina, ma'am.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.070
See? Okay,
that's from an expert.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.240
You know, this is what I
said in the beginning.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.740
- I'm not seeing that.
- Well, you don't have any frame of reference.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.780
What if you trim
the topiary around the edge?

06:05.780 --> 06:07.780
- That could help.
- Nobody's gonna trim the topiary.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.110
- I'm not a porn star.
- You could be,

06:10.110 --> 06:12.950
- but you chose politics.
- What is this, the clitoris?

06:12.950 --> 06:15.240
You know what would be funny? We
should put the men's bathroom there.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.070
- They'll never find it.
- Well, actually, ma'am,

06:17.070 --> 06:18.740
the female pleasure center
is quite extensive.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.860
- Ah.
- Uh, no, it's not.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.320
- And that's the crypt, ma'am.
- Right, that's what I just said.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.950
No, the crypt.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.860
What?

06:26.860 --> 06:28.860
I'm gonna be buried there?

06:28.860 --> 06:31.780
Yeah, most of the formers
are buried at their libraries.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.990
- Okay, I gotta...
- I gotta go.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.280
- Really?
- That was Wendy.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.280
Ellen just got a spot in the Harper
Day School and full financial aid.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.490
See, that wouldn't have
happened if I paid you more.

06:42.490 --> 06:44.740
More? You never... Now,
ma'am, there is a problem.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.450
- What?
- As they were prepping for the groundbreaking,

06:47.450 --> 06:50.030
they discovered the
library might be situated

06:50.030 --> 06:52.200
on the site of Yale's
former slave quarters.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.570
Oh, come on. What? Yale
had slaves back then?

06:54.570 --> 06:57.320
- This is not good, ma'am.
- Wait, wait, wait, what if we own this?

06:57.320 --> 06:59.240
Not in a slavey way, but, like,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.660
if we put up a very sensitive
exhibit that talks about slavery

07:02.660 --> 07:05.320
and honors the men and women
who suffered there.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.320
Okay, well, that's
an excellent idea, Mike,

07:07.320 --> 07:11.660
but I'm not gonna have my vagi-brary
underground railroaded by this.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.160
- Mm-mm.
- All right, who else knows?

07:13.160 --> 07:15.030
Just the site manager,
that's it.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.410
But he's Italian, so he knows
how to keep bodies buried.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.110
Good. Nobody else can know.

07:19.110 --> 07:21.530
Right? Okay, Marjor...?
Okay, shit!

07:21.530 --> 07:22.610
Oh, shit!

07:22.610 --> 07:24.360
- Marjorie?!
- Marjorie?!

07:24.360 --> 07:26.320
- Marjorie!
- Marjorie!

07:26.320 --> 07:28.360
- Marjorie!
- Marjorie!

07:28.360 --> 07:30.360
- Marjorie!
- Marjorie!

07:30.360 --> 07:32.240
Slaves, Mother?

07:32.240 --> 07:36.820
- No way.
- Okay, Cat... what room is this, Catherine?

07:36.820 --> 07:39.200
- Oh, my God.
- I mean, when did we build

07:39.200 --> 07:41.320
an Indian casino gift shop?

07:41.320 --> 07:42.700
- It's the nursery.
- Seriously?

07:42.700 --> 07:44.860
- My God.
- Well, where are the toys?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.860
Or is the baby gonna
play chess against death?

07:46.860 --> 07:48.700
You know what, Mom,
as your daughter...

07:48.700 --> 07:50.490
And the library's
third biggest donor.

07:50.490 --> 07:52.950
Ugh. - ...and the library's
third biggest donor...

07:52.950 --> 07:55.610
Oh, I heard her. - ...you
cannot build this library

07:55.610 --> 07:59.990
on the oppressed backs
of the ancestors of my child!

07:59.990 --> 08:01.860
Listen to me, Catherine Kinte...

08:01.860 --> 08:03.570
- What am I on?
- Nothing.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.070
Okay, so you wanna talk
about second-class citizens?

08:06.070 --> 08:09.240
You wanna do that? Blacks
got the vote in 1870.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.860
- When did women get the vote? 1920!
- Sistas!

08:11.860 --> 08:14.030
Well, the Voting Rights Act
was in 1965.

08:14.030 --> 08:16.490
Mom, you are going to be
the grandmother of a child

08:16.490 --> 08:19.320
- that is half black.
- And 1/16 French Huguenot.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.160
I cannot stand that term.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.410
Ma'am, the nomenclature has moved
away from African American.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.490
It is black... - No, I'm
talking about grandmother.

08:25.490 --> 08:28.280
Okay? I am still a young woman.
Yes.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.030
- Really! Look at my hands.
- Gorgeous.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.490
- Look at my neck, okay?
- Ooh.

08:31.490 --> 08:36.030
I am not about to buried
in a twat of my own making!

08:36.030 --> 08:37.950
I'm still relevant!

08:37.950 --> 08:40.030
Nobody likes
a tattletale, Marjorie.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.410
- Well, good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, ma'am.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.950
Vice President Selina Meyer
to see the president.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.780
- Oh, hey, Ben.
- Madam Vice President.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.700
- How are you?
- I'm good, thank you.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.910
- The president is very, very busy right now.
- Oh, I know, I know.

08:56.910 --> 08:58.450
Why don't I show you
your office first?

08:58.450 --> 09:00.070
- Oh, sure. Yeah!
- Okay?

09:00.070 --> 09:02.030
- Right across the street here.
- What?

09:02.030 --> 09:03.570
- The EEOB?
- Yeah.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.990
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:05.990 --> 09:08.780
Hughes promised me an office
here in the West Wing.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.280
Well, it's just
right across the street.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.030
You'll be neighbors.

09:12.030 --> 09:15.070
Okay, I haven't spoken to my
neighbors in my entire fucking life.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.610
- I don't even know who they are.
- Oh, be glad. I've met them.

09:17.610 --> 09:19.110
All right? You and I both know

09:19.110 --> 09:22.360
that Hughes would never do
this if I was a male VP.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.910
We'd be out, shotgun and beers

09:24.910 --> 09:27.990
and sucking each other off
like Carter and Mondale.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.570
Don't look at me
with that smirk.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.320
You know that's the case.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.910
- You need to understand.
- Oh.

09:32.910 --> 09:36.820
The president doesn't actually
want you to do anything

09:36.820 --> 09:39.200
other than continue
to be a woman,

09:39.200 --> 09:41.320
which you're doing
a pretty okay job at.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.240
- Okay?
- So I'm gonna let you walk the rest of the way.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.700
I'm trying to cut down
on exercise, okay?

09:46.700 --> 09:48.070
He'll call you if he needs you.

09:48.070 --> 09:50.820
Um, well, you are
an exceptional woman.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.360
I know, but we
are gonna fight this.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.160
- Madam Vice President.
- Yeah.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.860
- God, that feels good to say.
- So where are the new digs, huh?

09:56.860 --> 10:00.530
- Are we close to a kitchen?
- Well, I actually have good news.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.860
We are going to be in the EEOB.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.320
- Oh.
- Yeah. No, it's good.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.990
I'm thinking we need
to distance ourselves

10:07.990 --> 10:10.910
from this sort of
"one and done" administration.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.450
- So, this is your decision?
- Yes, it is.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.280
And you don't want me to shut that down
right now? - I'm so sorry to interrupt.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.700
Madam Vice President,
I'm Jonah Ryan.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.740
- Okay.
- I am... oh, I am a West Wing intern.

10:20.740 --> 10:24.200
- Oh, congratulations. Okay.
- I just wanna say it's such an honor to meet you.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.950
The only reason that I voted for Hughes
is because you were on the ticket.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.410
Well, I'm sure you're not alone.

10:29.410 --> 10:32.910
Maybe we can pull some strings and
get you assigned to the EEOB.

10:32.910 --> 10:34.360
Yeah... maybe.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.660
- Oh, Mr. Cafferty!
- See that?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.820
- He's kind of cute, Amy. What do you think?
- Huh, yeah.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.860
Hello, sir. I just wanna say what
a pleasure it is to meet you.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.410
And the only reason that I voted for
Hughes is because I knew you were

10:43.410 --> 10:45.530
his campaign man... - I have
two things for you to do.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.490
They're important.
Can you handle it?

10:47.490 --> 10:49.360
Of course. Yes, absolutely, sir.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.240
One... get the fuck away from me.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.740
Two... stay the fuck
away from me.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.570
- Okay? Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.410
I won't let you down.

10:57.410 --> 10:59.860
God, I love interns.

11:02.070 --> 11:06.200
Congressman, there's a simple and easy
solution to the homeless problem...

11:06.200 --> 11:09.110
Pass mandatory sentencing
laws for vagrancy.

11:09.110 --> 11:12.450
Then these unfortunates
will finally have a home...

11:12.450 --> 11:13.910
My prisons.

11:13.910 --> 11:16.610
Look, I hate the homeless
as much as any librarian.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.860
That's why God created subzero
winters and the third rail,

11:19.860 --> 11:23.530
but chances of me pushing for any tax
incentives for these private hoosegows

11:23.530 --> 11:25.320
is about as likely
as what, Will?

11:25.320 --> 11:28.200
As me walking out of a bar with less
than 10 types of semen in my hair.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.990
- You can't go in there!
- Sir, I know I don't have an appointment,

11:29.990 --> 11:32.450
- but what I have to say is...
- Holy shit!

11:32.450 --> 11:36.530
I can't believe you're actually showing
that camel snatch you call a face in DC.

11:36.530 --> 11:40.360
You're about as welcome here as Jerry
Sandusky at an open call for "Oliver."

11:40.360 --> 11:42.360
Here, you want a dried apricot?
They're Turkish.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.200
Anything I can do
to annoy the Armenians.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.610
All right,
good seeing you, Tanzy.

11:45.610 --> 11:47.030
Let me know when
you find your wallet.

11:47.030 --> 11:48.990
Oh, hey, Jonah,
can we get lunch sometime?

11:48.990 --> 11:51.530
I wanna talk about you being
the legal guardian to my baby

11:51.530 --> 11:52.990
if anything happens
to me and Mary, okay?

11:52.990 --> 11:54.360
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.860
I hope you're not here
for Shawnee.

11:55.860 --> 11:58.240
No, sir. I am here
with a final solution

11:58.240 --> 12:00.610
- to restore me to power.
- Jonah, Jonah.

12:00.610 --> 12:02.360
Sir, I will do
anything that you say.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.570
I know. That's what
I love about you.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.990
It's like that fagela cowboy movie.
"I can't quit you."

12:07.990 --> 12:09.990
Yes, thank you, sir.
Butch and Sundance.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.530
The point is now is not the time

12:11.530 --> 12:14.160
to go putzing after
representatives, congressmen.

12:14.160 --> 12:18.660
No! From now on, I'm only
buying senators and presidents.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.160
That's the way to affect
meaningful change.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.780
We'll always have
the shutdown, won't we?

12:24.780 --> 12:26.700
Huge miscalculation.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.910
Mayor Thompson, I hope you'll
support me in November

12:33.910 --> 12:35.280
in the Senate contest.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.570
Absolutely,
Congresswoman Meyers.

12:37.570 --> 12:38.990
Thank you. No, op, op, op.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.660
It's Meyer.
There's no "S" at the end.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.820
Look, you can see right here
on the... on the bus.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.240
- There's no "S."
- Oh, Jewish.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.990
- No, mm-mm. No.
- No?

12:45.990 --> 12:47.660
Oh, what a great county this is.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.700
I just love... everybody here
is so well-behaved and polite.

12:50.700 --> 12:54.070
- Thank you! What joy! We gotta go.
- It is like Selinamania, right?

12:54.070 --> 12:55.530
- Okay.
- Selina, Selina.

12:55.530 --> 12:58.360
We are fucked two ways
which till Tuesday.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.700
- What are you talking about?
- We've completely spent all of our TV money.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.110
Well, who's in charge of that?

13:03.110 --> 13:05.110
Technically, I am,
but when you buy these ads...

13:05.110 --> 13:07.360
That's not my problem.
All right, we're leaving, okay?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.990
Hey, Andrew, we have
gotta fire that Mike guy.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.200
He's the biggest
goddamn idiot I've ever...

13:12.200 --> 13:15.240
Selina! Hey! Uh, boy, I got...

13:15.240 --> 13:18.240
Can you believe I put a pen
in my pocket without a cap?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.450
And Sally was helping me
get the stain out.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.160
You remember Sally Nuefeld,
our biggest donor?

13:24.160 --> 13:25.530
- Nuefeld department stores.
- Hi.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.990
You know, I'm so glad that
I've just run into you, Sally.

13:32.990 --> 13:36.700
- You are?
- We need to make a TV buy tonight.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.820
Otherwise,
we're dead in the water.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.820
So maybe you could help us

13:40.820 --> 13:44.820
grease the knob or the
wheel or whatever it is.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.780
- You know, I would love to, Selina...
- Oh, great!

13:46.780 --> 13:48.910
But we've already given to a
number of candidates this cycle, so...

13:48.910 --> 13:50.660
Yeah, you know,
I wish your husband was here

13:50.660 --> 13:53.990
because I would love for him
to hear about the story

13:53.990 --> 13:57.200
of you and Andrew
on the bus with the pen.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.110
- Let me get my checkbook.
- Oh, can we have your pen, Andrew?

14:00.110 --> 14:01.780
- I don't have a pen.
- Oh, you don't.

14:01.780 --> 14:03.950
- Oh! We threw the pen out.
- I don't give a fuck.

14:03.950 --> 14:06.910
- Okay, how does 25,000 sound?
- Well, I'll tell you something,

14:06.910 --> 14:10.160
why don't you put your money
where your mouth was... is...

14:10.160 --> 14:13.780
- And add another zero?
- That should be no problem.

14:13.780 --> 14:14.780
Oh, goody!

14:16.950 --> 14:20.110
And that's why I need your help
telling the Danny Chung story...

14:20.110 --> 14:22.780
How I pulled a Marine
from a burning tank.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.700
- Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're familiar with the story.

14:24.700 --> 14:28.070
How about this?
How about an interview

14:28.070 --> 14:30.240
with the soldier that you
pulled from the tank?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.780
- That's an excellent idea.
- Yeah, thank you.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.530
But best not to contact him
for personal reasons,

14:35.530 --> 14:37.110
or, really, anyone who saw it.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.950
I don't wanna retrigger.

14:38.950 --> 14:41.530
But this is the kind of
thinking I need for my team.

14:41.530 --> 14:43.860
Mm. Well, let us put
together an action plan.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.280
- All right.
- Great.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.320
Ready for a change,
ready for Chung.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.950
Ready for a "chunge."

14:48.950 --> 14:51.110
First "chunge," we're
gonna fix that slogan.

14:51.110 --> 14:53.780
- Really?
- I'm kidding. It's great.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.450
There's Amy. Come on in.
How you doing, Danny?

14:55.450 --> 14:57.110
You know, we could
really use you, Ames.

14:57.110 --> 14:58.490
Give us a little touch
of the feminine.

14:58.490 --> 15:00.200
You and I could
split those duties.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.910
Yeah, I think I, uh...
I've been waiting a long time

15:02.910 --> 15:04.820
- for us to get together.
- There it is.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.740
- There we go.
- Back at full strength!

15:06.740 --> 15:09.240
We can accomplish beautiful things...
Absolutely.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.740
- In this town, gentlemen.
- Yeah.

15:10.740 --> 15:13.320
I'm just gonna have to
talk to Selina...

15:13.320 --> 15:15.200
- Oh, Amy's out.
- No!

15:15.200 --> 15:16.490
- Thanks for coming in, Ame.
- No!

15:16.490 --> 15:17.990
We're not gonna
validate your parking.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.700
- You don't mind that, do you?
- No, I just meant

15:20.700 --> 15:24.200
that I'm gonna tell her
once and for all th-that...

15:26.030 --> 15:29.360
Okay, so Lu wants to meet
in Hong Kong to talk Brazil.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.360
- We'll leave Friday.
- That's so funny because

15:31.360 --> 15:33.950
the lady who does my
Brazilian is from Hong Kong.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.160
- Oh!
- It's Kismit.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.530
I know. It really is, isn't it?

15:36.530 --> 15:38.450
No, her name is Kismit.

15:38.450 --> 15:39.820
They make her use Linda, but...

15:39.820 --> 15:41.700
You know, my favorite
cousin Hamid went here.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.450
He partied his balls off.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.530
Oh, my God, we should've invited
him to come to the thing today.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.530
- Oh, he's not exactly on the yes-fly list.
- Oh.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.860
Mom, I'm so glad my doctor
cleared me to come today.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.240
But you gotta be careful with
that McLintock cervix of yours.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.110
- Oh, it's incompetent cervix, ma'am.
- That's what I said, Marjorie.

15:55.110 --> 15:56.860
- Zing! You got me, ma'am.
- Hey!

15:56.860 --> 15:59.360
- Quartie!
- Who's the head librarian now?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.990
- I love the new design on the building there.
- Yeah, right.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.160
My God, looks like
Queen Kong's cooter.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.450
That's what we were going for!

16:05.450 --> 16:06.780
- Hog jaw!
- Yeah.

16:06.780 --> 16:08.360
That ain't the first time
I spent 20 million

16:08.360 --> 16:11.030
- on a piece of pussy.
- Oh, good on you, Quartie.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.660
- Okay, have fun.
- Thank you. Yes, yes, yes.

16:12.660 --> 16:15.200
Absolutely. Let's go get
President Caldwell, please.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.530
- On it, ma'am.
- Yeah.

16:16.530 --> 16:19.530
Now that the library
is officially moving forward,

16:19.530 --> 16:21.570
- I really need clarity on my role.
- Yeah.

16:21.570 --> 16:23.410
So it's time for you
to make a decision.

16:23.410 --> 16:26.160
Yes, and I think I did, 'cause
I talked to you about that.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.910
- About?
- The chicken, right?

16:27.910 --> 16:29.410
- Nope.
- You didn't want red meat for a week.

16:29.410 --> 16:31.240
No, no, no, no, who is in
charge of the library?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.410
Is it Richard or is it me?

16:32.410 --> 16:33.820
Because if it's not me, I have...

16:33.820 --> 16:35.910
I have another offer
and I'm going to take...

16:35.910 --> 16:38.450
- Oh, Jim! There you are.
- Madam President.

16:38.450 --> 16:39.740
- Oh.
- This is the President of Yale, ma'am.

16:39.740 --> 16:41.820
- I found him.
- How are you?

16:41.820 --> 16:44.280
Well, I've got a professor of
gender studies suing for tenure.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.530
- You can imagine what that's about.
- Oh, my God.

16:46.530 --> 16:49.160
Well, this thing shouldn't take too
long, so we can get you out of here.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.110
Actually, Madam President,
the "Washington Post" called

16:52.110 --> 16:55.990
asking for comment on the story
that the library site

16:55.990 --> 16:58.530
was originally the
university's slave quarters.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.780
That's Leon. It's gotta be Leon.

17:00.780 --> 17:03.240
I'm embarrassed, but the
university is going to have to

17:03.240 --> 17:04.990
take some time
to study the situation.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.359
What? What are you
talking about?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.030
We're having
the groundbreaking today.

17:08.030 --> 17:09.569
If it were up to me,

17:09.569 --> 17:12.819
we'd be putting up drywall
on your vagina building today.

17:12.819 --> 17:15.569
- Well, I appreciate that, Jim, I really do.
- But in the current climate

17:15.569 --> 17:18.030
with the lawsuit
and with one of our adjuncts

17:18.030 --> 17:20.490
in the Hillel function
with the sombrero...

17:20.490 --> 17:23.240
I don't know what that is. - ...you
can understand that this is not a time

17:23.240 --> 17:27.069
we wanna put a spotlight on our
historic association with slavery.

17:27.069 --> 17:29.240
After all,
this is Yale, not Brown.

17:29.240 --> 17:33.110
I got waitlisted there.
Oh, oh, ow, ow, ow!

17:33.110 --> 17:35.280
Ma'am, I think her water
just broke, ma'am.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.990
- Good Christ!
- Are you kidding me?

17:36.990 --> 17:38.820
I will be in touch.
In the meantime,

17:38.820 --> 17:41.360
if you're trying to get out of
town, don't take High Street.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.530
The KKK... that's
the Kool Kweers of Kolor...

17:44.530 --> 17:48.240
Oh. - ...is having a "pee-in"
in front of Skull and Bones.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.320
Got that. Thank you.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.360
- I mean...
- Ma'am.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.570
Yale pulled out without
even coming on my tits?

17:55.570 --> 17:58.110
Things sure have changed
since I went to college.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.320
- We're gonna take her back to Mount Sinai, ma'am.
- Let's go.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.990
Here we go.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.990
These are genuine pieces of the wall.
The baby's crowing.

18:07.990 --> 18:09.320
You know what? I should go.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.570
- Here come the shoulders.
- Oh, my God,

18:10.570 --> 18:11.740
I wish I had let you do anal.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.360
It would've hurt less than this!

18:13.360 --> 18:15.410
- See?
- Oh, I'll up the dosage on your spinal.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.490
Oh, God, I like her. I like you.

18:17.490 --> 18:20.030
- Have you decided on a name?
- No. What's your name?

18:20.030 --> 18:22.070
- Sandra.
- Yeah, not that.

18:22.070 --> 18:23.820
Hey, how about those ice chips?

18:23.820 --> 18:25.610
- I need ice chips.
- Hi, I'm Gary.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.280
- Hi.
- I ground these myself.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.820
- Okay.
- The hospital ones are so big.

18:28.820 --> 18:31.450
- There we go. There you go.
- Thank you.

18:31.450 --> 18:32.780
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.570
- Okay, Doctor...
- Sengupta.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.700
- Gundupta.
- I'm gonna get you a cookie.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.860
Here we go, push.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.910
Okay, we're looking good,
we're looking good.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.780
- Here it comes.
- Oh, my God!

18:42.780 --> 18:45.070
Congratulations,
Mommy and Daddy.

18:45.070 --> 18:46.860
- Here's your baby.
- Is that its hair?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.700
- Yeah.
- Will you be nursing?

18:48.700 --> 18:50.610
No. My God, I'm not a goat.

18:50.610 --> 18:53.700
- No, those are for Daddy.
- Ooh, God, Sandra?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.240
Can you write down your number in
case we have any questions about it?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.280
- Okay.
- You can give it to my husband, Andrew.

19:01.570 --> 19:02.820
Hi.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.610
- I think I wanna run for Congress.
- Huh.

19:08.610 --> 19:11.410
Oh, some black shit
is coming out of it.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.780
- Good... yeah.
- Loud. It's so loud.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.030
I've never heard anything
quite like... ooh.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.780
Ugh, it's loud.

19:20.070 --> 19:21.570
Oh, ah.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.070
- You went ahead without me.
- The baby has my elbows.

19:24.070 --> 19:26.740
Mom, where have you been?
They're ready to send us home.

19:26.740 --> 19:29.360
Okay, well, Catherine, slaves
have ruined my library...

19:29.360 --> 19:31.700
Yeah. - ...so you can
stop attacking me.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.070
You know how busy your
mother is, Catherine.

19:34.070 --> 19:37.320
What are you doing here? - Our daughter
wanted at least one of her parents to be here.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.910
- Fortunately, I was available.
- So, what is it? What do we got?

19:39.910 --> 19:42.200
- A boy or a girl?
- Well, if we're judging by sex organs,

19:42.200 --> 19:44.030
which apparently we're not,
it's a boy.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.570
- Thank God.
- Would you like to hold him, Grandma'am?

19:45.570 --> 19:47.570
- I'll take your purse.
- No, it's fine.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.450
- I'll just give him a boop-boop, pat-pat.
- I packed your toiletries,

19:49.450 --> 19:51.110
- so you're all set to go.
- Monnie.

19:51.110 --> 19:53.570
- Oh! Grandma!
- Yeah.

19:53.570 --> 19:57.110
- Congratulations.
- Okay, when did you come back into the picture?

19:57.110 --> 19:59.820
- What do you mean?
- Nope. Mm-mm.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.110
Is Mama ready to roll out?

20:01.110 --> 20:03.450
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

20:03.450 --> 20:07.160
- Oh, thank you.
- You're Monica from "Monica."

20:07.160 --> 20:09.700
- Oh, yeah!
- It is a dream of mine to cook with you someday.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.450
- It's my dream, too.
- Aw, well, we should make that happen.

20:12.450 --> 20:15.450
- I'll get your number.
- Absolutely, we should make that happen.

20:15.450 --> 20:18.700
- Go, just go.
- Open up a bottle of Chateau Montelena.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.570
Okay, so what are we
calling him?

20:20.570 --> 20:22.820
Aluminum? Tenafly? Ribbon?

20:22.820 --> 20:25.610
- We haven't landed on a name yet.
- I don't mind Tenafly.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.530
You know, what about Richard?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.740
That would be kind of cute 'cause then
we could call him Little Richard.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.410
Love! - I was actually named
after my godmother, Richardina.

20:32.410 --> 20:34.450
Everybody just called her Regina.
Oh, boy.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.160
You know what, actually, I
probably wasn't named after her.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.030
I just got here, but I
guess we're leaving now.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.860
Oh, hello! Look at
this little creature.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.860
Looks just like both of you.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.110
- Oh! Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

20:46.110 --> 20:48.360
So, in the Quran,
it is recommended

20:48.360 --> 20:49.700
that upon the birth of a child,

20:49.700 --> 20:51.860
a father should
slaughter two goats.

20:51.860 --> 20:54.530
However, out of respect
for your veganism,

20:54.530 --> 20:57.410
I got you
the wipe warmer instead.

20:57.410 --> 21:00.070
- Yes! Yes, thank you.
- Oh! Wow, thank you.

21:00.070 --> 21:02.530
Ambassador Jaffar, if I could
nibble your ear for a moment

21:02.530 --> 21:05.200
about a sand opportunity
I'm currently involved with.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.570
- I'm all set with sand.
- But this is beach sand.

21:07.570 --> 21:08.990
He doesn't want sand.

21:08.990 --> 21:11.070
Madam President!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.570
This is traumatizing
for the baby.

21:12.570 --> 21:14.700
No, I know. You know what?
I'm gonna help you.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.820
I'm gonna help you out. - Mom.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.320
- We're good. Shh.
- Everyone say hello to Little Richard.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.530
- Is that the baby's name?
- Yes.

21:20.530 --> 21:21.990
- No, it's not.
- I have to say

21:21.990 --> 21:24.240
that as the proud grand...

21:24.240 --> 21:28.860
Mother. - ...mother of
an African American baby,

21:28.860 --> 21:33.820
I would rather never have
a presidential library

21:33.820 --> 21:39.280
than to have one that is built
on the backs of dead slaves.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.200
- Shame on Yale.
- Yeah.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.360
- And shame on Amy Brookheimer.
- Yes.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.860
Oh, and this is
my lesbian daughter's

21:46.860 --> 21:50.160
Native American lesbian
life partner, Marjorie.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.860
- Sweetie.
- Madam President,

21:51.860 --> 21:53.990
the American public
would like to know

21:53.990 --> 21:56.320
when you're going to come clean about
your stay at Whispering Sands.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.780
Okay, well, I have
a confession to make.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.780
Both my daughter and my mother

22:01.780 --> 22:03.820
have struggled greatly

22:03.820 --> 22:07.360
with very serious
mental health problems.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.570
- What?
- Don't worry, it runs in my family, too.

22:09.570 --> 22:13.070
If this administration
continues to ignore

22:13.070 --> 22:16.780
the mental health crisis
in this country,

22:16.780 --> 22:19.070
well, you know, it's crazy.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.910
It really is. Yeah, thank you.

22:21.910 --> 22:24.490
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Thank you!

22:24.490 --> 22:27.780
Ma'am, I'm so sorry
you lost your library.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.450
You know, last night,
I dreamt that

22:29.450 --> 22:32.070
I removed Leon West's balls
with an ice cream scoop

22:32.070 --> 22:35.410
- and I think I actually came.
- Is everything always ice cream with you?

22:35.410 --> 22:38.450
- Just say the word, ma'am, and I will...
- Amy, Amy.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.450
I leaked it to Leon.

22:40.450 --> 22:43.950
Why? Why would you
Kurt Cobain your own library?

22:43.950 --> 22:45.700
Because, girlie,

22:45.700 --> 22:49.610
only former presidents
have libraries.

22:49.610 --> 22:53.660
And I'm running for president.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.990
You're... you're running again?!

22:56.990 --> 22:59.110
The band is getting
back together again!

22:59.110 --> 23:01.200
- Who cc'd Mike?
- I get it, I'm Ringo.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.740
- We need champagne!
- No, Amy's Ringo.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.410
You're Mark David
Chapman's bullet.

23:04.410 --> 23:05.950
How is this even possible?

23:05.950 --> 23:07.700
Tibet! Tibet! It's all Tibet!

23:07.700 --> 23:10.110
We are gonna ride
that Dalai Lama

23:10.110 --> 23:12.780
like Mrs. Lama
on book club night.

23:12.780 --> 23:15.030
Hey!

23:15.030 --> 23:17.490
- And what about Montez?
- She's a Mexican who stole your job.

23:17.490 --> 23:21.160
- She did, in fact, steal my job.
- Her numbers are under agua.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.490
I can't believe this.
We're back!

23:22.490 --> 23:24.110
I do need to talk to you
about your role.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.860
And, Mike, I need to talk
to you about your role, too.

23:25.860 --> 23:27.990
- Sweet.
- To Team Meyer.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.820
- Team Meyer!
- Second time's the charm.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.610
- It's actually fourth.
- Fourth.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.610
- Fourth time's the charm.
- Yeah, that's fourth, ma'am.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.780
So, uh, what do you think?

23:36.780 --> 23:38.820
- Beats working for Jonah.
- Yeah.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.030
There's just one last
thing you need to do.

23:41.030 --> 23:42.660
Mm, I'm not gonna do that.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.990
- Selina, you have to do it.
- Mm-mm.

23:51.490 --> 23:54.280
You know, there's
a restaurant in Kowloon

23:54.280 --> 23:56.530
that has a clay-baked
chicken dish

23:56.530 --> 23:58.200
that you have to order
24 hours in advance.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.990
Yeah, Jaffar, I can't.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.410
I understand.

24:01.410 --> 24:02.530
24 hours seems like
a lot of hoopla

24:02.530 --> 24:03.700
for chicken, doesn't it?

24:03.700 --> 24:05.910
I mean I can't... I can't, um,

24:05.910 --> 24:07.820
go to Hong Kong
with you anymore.

24:07.820 --> 24:09.450
No, the Chinese
are expecting us.

24:09.450 --> 24:11.200
The Brazil plan is set.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.780
No, I just, you know...

24:12.780 --> 24:14.360
I've been rethinking things,

24:14.360 --> 24:17.410
and there are
some new options for me.

24:17.410 --> 24:18.860
Okay?

24:18.860 --> 24:20.160
Post-Tibet.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.910
Um, well...

24:24.200 --> 24:26.200
I don't have any problem
with options.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.070
Yeah, but, you know,
the options will be

24:29.070 --> 24:32.070
a lot easier
without any baggage.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.610
Muslim baggage?

24:35.610 --> 24:39.110
- Jaffar, you are so sophisticated...
- Oh, come on.

24:39.110 --> 24:43.780
And your grasp
of geopolitics is just...

24:43.780 --> 24:45.700
- Selina, what are you...
- And those are assets

24:45.700 --> 24:47.570
anywhere in the world except...

24:47.570 --> 24:49.610
- In America?
- In the United States, yeah.

24:49.610 --> 24:52.820
And most of Europe,
except Germany,

24:52.820 --> 24:54.740
you know,
'cause they overcorrect.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.860
You should take this back.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.490
Right?

25:01.490 --> 25:03.070
Yes, I want it back.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

25:14.740 --> 25:17.410
- Oh, my God, Madam President!
- Hi.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.200
Whoo! Council Bluffs,
Iowa, here we are!

25:36.200 --> 25:38.570
Exactly 20 minutes from Omaha.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.860
- Not exactly.
- Okay, who has my speech?

25:40.860 --> 25:44.070
I need my speech. - How are the girls
and Big and Little Richard doing?

25:44.070 --> 25:46.530
- How are your kids, Ben?
- Ooh, touché.

25:46.530 --> 25:48.110
- Ma'am, here's your speech.
- Yes? Oh!

25:48.110 --> 25:49.570
Thank you, Leon. Look at this.

25:49.570 --> 25:51.780
There are no typos,
there are no food stains,

25:51.780 --> 25:53.950
- you spelled Meyer right.
- Well, I am a grown man.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.110
Okay, Madison-Monroe dinner.

25:56.110 --> 25:58.950
- Really brings back old memories, huh?
- Ooh, and she's back.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.780
Knock 'em dead, ma'am.
Dan, you got a sec?

26:00.780 --> 26:03.780
Uh, yeah, yeah. What's up?

26:03.780 --> 26:06.110
Ben's right...
A lot of memories.

26:06.110 --> 26:08.660
- She and I started here seven years ago.
- Oh, tell me about it.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.030
I was here in 2012,

26:10.030 --> 26:11.820
"Steve Bing'd"
a couple stewardesses.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.450
Will you stop being
exactly like yourself?

26:13.450 --> 26:15.530
- You're fucking ruining this.
- Ruining what?

26:15.530 --> 26:17.320
Remember a couple months
ago after you got fired

26:17.320 --> 26:18.740
and we had drinks with Ben?

26:18.740 --> 26:21.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we had a lot of drinks.

26:21.490 --> 26:24.110
Yeah, well, I'm pregnant
and it's yours.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.320
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Fuck!

26:34.070 --> 26:36.320
I really thought things were
starting to turn around.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.360
Thank you!

26:43.490 --> 26:45.490
Thank you.

26:45.490 --> 26:46.700
Thank you.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.700
It is so great to be back

26:48.700 --> 26:51.530
among all our friends in Iowa!

26:55.200 --> 26:57.530
You know, there's been
a lot of speculation

26:57.530 --> 26:59.700
about me running for president.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.030
Again.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.320
But tonight is not about that.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.200
No, over the next few months,

27:05.200 --> 27:07.200
folks, I will embark on
what I call

27:07.200 --> 27:11.410
a feeling tour across America,

27:11.410 --> 27:14.030
from Palo Alto to Hollywood,

27:14.030 --> 27:16.780
from Iowa to New Hampshire,

27:16.780 --> 27:19.910
and from the Hamptons
to Wall Street.

27:19.910 --> 27:23.860
I'm going to be with
the real folks out there.

27:23.860 --> 27:26.030
I wanna feel their feelings

27:26.030 --> 27:28.820
and I wanna hear
their speakings.

27:28.820 --> 27:31.450
You know, I have to tell you,
when I left the White House,

27:31.450 --> 27:33.530
I could've gone anywhere.

27:33.530 --> 27:34.740
But I didn't.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.280
I chose the South Bronx

27:37.280 --> 27:41.570
so I could feel and smell
what America was all about.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.740
- It smells good!
-

27:46.860 --> 27:48.240
Two years ago,

27:48.240 --> 27:51.740
I stood right here
in my old high school gym

27:51.740 --> 27:54.320
where I was chosen for
many, many sports teams,

27:54.320 --> 27:57.910
surrounded by my family
and my... my friends

27:57.910 --> 28:00.450
to seek your support
for Congress

28:00.450 --> 28:04.200
as the ultimate
insider's outsider.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.410
And if there's one thing
that you should know about me,

28:07.410 --> 28:10.490
Washington insiders, they
didn't like me very much.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.280
So let's send them a message

28:12.280 --> 28:14.740
by shoving the guy
that they hate the most

28:14.740 --> 28:16.410
right back in their faces.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.530
I am announcing
my exploratory committee

28:18.530 --> 28:21.070
for the Presidency of the
United States of America,

28:21.070 --> 28:23.530
which basically means
I'm definitely running.

28:23.530 --> 28:25.610
God bless New Hampshire.

28:25.610 --> 28:27.530
God bless the United
States of America

28:27.530 --> 28:30.160
and Puerto Rico... if they
can vote for president...

28:30.160 --> 28:32.110
And God bless Jonah Ryan.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.780
Thank you. Thank you.

28:34.780 --> 28:37.240
Okay, people, look, the
president can only do so much

28:37.240 --> 28:39.360
without the cooperation
of the Congress.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.820
I can't impress upon you enough

28:40.820 --> 28:42.530
that this process only works

28:42.530 --> 28:44.490
when there's bipartisan
communication.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.160
That is what the Constitution
requires, right?

28:47.160 --> 28:50.610
- Okay, you in the back.
- Uh, will this be on the final?

28:50.610 --> 28:52.910
Uh, no comment.

28:52.910 --> 28:54.490
Old habits die hard, I guess.

28:54.490 --> 28:56.320
Uh, yes. No.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.910
Actually, I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

28:58.910 --> 29:00.780
That's an old... you know what?
I don't know.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.110
So we'll deal with it later.

29:03.110 --> 29:05.860
Okay, perfect. Remember, three
branches of government...

29:05.860 --> 29:08.280
Judiciary, legislative,

29:08.280 --> 29:09.740
and there's a third.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.070
And if you wanna know
something about government,

29:13.070 --> 29:15.660
watch this film "Air Force One."

29:15.660 --> 29:16.820
It's a good movie.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.320
Shows you what
a president can do.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.820
Nice to meet you,
and I'll see you guys

29:19.820 --> 29:20.820
Wednes... Tuesday.
