00:11.636 --> 00:13.471
<i>After several weeks of dating,</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:17.225
<i>things between our two young lovebirds</i>
<i>were seriously heating up</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:19.477
<i>to about room temperature.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:22.605
<i>'Cause that's as hot as things can get</i>
<i>with two Indian moms</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.441
<i>constantly hovering nearby.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:29.237
<i>But even though there was very little</i>
<i>action happening between these two,</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:32.657
<i>Devi was feeling happier</i>
<i>in this new relationship</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:34.576
<i>than she had in a long time.</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:36.286
Hey, Devi!

00:37.287 --> 00:38.246
Hey.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.046
<i>I mean, look at them.</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.715
<i>No one can deny</i>
<i>there's some great chemistry here.</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:52.010
<i>Too bad it'll now be channeled</i>
<i>into an hour's worth of footsie.</i>

00:58.808 --> 01:01.603
Ugh. You guys, Des and I need to hook up.

01:01.686 --> 01:02.687
Because of our moms,

01:02.771 --> 01:05.356
all we can do is just panic French
when they're not looking.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.941
I'm getting like blue oves.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.069
-Oh.
-Sorry. That sounds painful.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.863
It's not like I need
to have full-on sex yet,

01:11.946 --> 01:14.157
but I do want to get horizontal, you know?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.075
Totally.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.701
Ugh. It's just so annoying

01:16.785 --> 01:19.788
because otherwise,
Des and I are really great.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.873
This might be my best relationship ever.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.627
Okay, which I know
is an incredibly low bar,

01:26.211 --> 01:28.088
but I just feel really happy.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.715
Well, it just sounds like
you need your mom out of the house

01:30.799 --> 01:32.217
so you can have some alone time.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.678
Nah, if she found out I had a boy over,
my ass would be Rapunzeled.

01:35.762 --> 01:40.475
Well, what if you threw a game night
with your friends and Des's friends.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.685
While we're in a deep game of charades,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.814
you can steal Des
up to your room and get horizonts.

01:45.897 --> 01:49.567
Okay, okay. I'm loving this idea,
but how do we get my mom to leave?

01:49.651 --> 01:53.196
I mean, she hates most people,
and she just bought a 1,000-piece puzzle.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.866
Would any of you girls want tickets
to Shen Yun?

01:56.950 --> 02:00.286
The Chinese dance show that buys
all the ad space in our school paper?

02:00.370 --> 02:03.832
Yeah. It's a rich celebration
of color and sound.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.292
I was gonna surprise
my book club with them,

02:06.376 --> 02:09.045
but they kicked me out for asking
to read <i>Outlander</i> a third time.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.463
Uh, actually, yeah.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.633
I'd be happy to take those tickets off
of your hands, Mrs. Paloma.

02:13.716 --> 02:18.221
Wonderful. The seats are partial view
in the rear of the second mezzanine.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.472
Enjoy.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.974
<i>And with those tickets</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:24.352
<i>came Devi's ticket</i>
<i>to some alone time with Des.</i>

02:28.022 --> 02:29.023
Weird.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.902
Says the boy who had to go to the hospital
to have his shit removed.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.821
Good morning, gorgeous beings.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.615
I spent the weekend in Ojai
communing with your work<i>,</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:40.994
and it was powerful and sensual and…

02:41.077 --> 02:43.037
knocked me flat on my ass.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.708
So, with that being said,
here are your pear drawings back.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.752
Margot, it's violent. It's chaotic.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.337
Brava. A-plus.

02:51.838 --> 02:57.427
Trent, your pear made me
question everything. A-plus-plus.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.097
Thank you, Ms. Nuni.
I, like, became a pear to make this.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.348
I know you did.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.351
And yours was bad. D-minus.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.853
What? What?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.897
Did you not understand the assignment?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.941
Yeah, you said to draw a pear and I did.
It… It looks exactly like Margot's.

03:12.025 --> 03:16.738
First of all, I never said draw a pear.
I said capture a pear.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.782
I don't see the pear's journey here.
I don't see its needs.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.159
Its needs?

03:21.242 --> 03:23.953
Ms. Nuni, it needs an A-plus.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.124
Well, if you want a higher score,
you're gonna have to go deeper, Ben.

03:28.208 --> 03:32.295
And you can try the assignment again.
I just insist that Margot tutor you.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.006
Tutor me? No, I-I'm not a tutee.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.758
I'm the one who does the tutoring.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.220
Mmm. Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.766
All right, so what do you think?

03:44.849 --> 03:46.976
Who's ready to get
the Shen Yunned out of them?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.604
I'm confused.
Your teacher just gave you these?

03:49.687 --> 03:52.065
-Mm-hmm.
-Did they ask for something in return?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.484
No. No, no, no, no. It was Mrs. Paloma.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.028
Don't worry.
There's nothing molesty happening here.

03:57.111 --> 04:01.491
Wow, Shen Yun. I've always wanted to see
that show, but not enough to get tickets.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.618
Didn't your sad teacher
have anything better,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.828
like tickets to <i>Mean Girls, </i>the musical?

04:05.912 --> 04:06.746
I'm a Regina.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.748
Devi, these tickets are for Friday.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.043
Rhyah and Des are supposed
to come over for dinner that night.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.086
Rhyah can go too.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.381
TripAdvisor describes it
as "magical and a feast for the senses

04:16.464 --> 04:17.882
and several hours long."

04:17.966 --> 04:20.635
Oh, and what will you be doing
while we're at the show?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.429
I was thinking of hosting
a game night for a few friends,

04:23.513 --> 04:26.307
like, Eleanor, Fabiola, and maybe Des
if he wanted to show up.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.976
<i>Nalini wasn't stupid.</i>

04:28.059 --> 04:30.103
<i>She knew Devi had a crush on Des,</i>

04:30.186 --> 04:34.524
<i>but also she was stupid because she had</i>
<i>no idea the crush was reciprocal</i>

04:34.607 --> 04:35.942
<i>and about to get physical.</i>

04:36.025 --> 04:39.779
I will allow this game night to happen,
and I will allow myself to be swept up

04:39.862 --> 04:43.074
in the exciting world of gymnastic dance.

04:46.244 --> 04:50.039
Yo, game night's gonna be kinda huge
and not just for sexy reasons.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624
Tonight's also gonna be the first time

04:51.708 --> 04:53.918
I'm hanging out
with Des's private school friends.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.587
I bought Monopoly Millionaire
to make them feel at home.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.382
-Mmm, right. 'Cause they're fancy.
-Mm-hmm.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.926
Oh, should Eleanor and I
try to class it up a bit?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.095
I have a t-shirt
that says, "Paris and Eleanor

05:04.178 --> 05:06.264
can do a pretty good Jackie O impression."

05:06.889 --> 05:08.641
No, just be normal.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.103
Hi. Sorry, babe,
I took your phone at lunch.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.273
Thought it was my graphing calculator.
Your new case is stupid huge.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.733
I know. Isn't it cool?

05:16.816 --> 05:19.068
This has enough battery power
to jump-start a car.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.446
Okay, my nerdy girlfriend.
I'll see you later.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.283
Aw. You guys are so cute.
How are things going?

05:25.366 --> 05:28.494
-Um, good.
-Why'd your voice go up an octave?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.413
I don't know.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.166
We just haven't been able to recapture
the passion of our first kiss.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.252
At first, I thought it was
new relationship jitters,

05:36.336 --> 05:37.503
but it's been weeks now.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.465
Well, maybe you just need
to take her back to the bathroom

05:40.548 --> 05:42.050
where your first kiss happened.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.676
I heard it. That was a gross idea.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.012
Maybe I'm just putting
too much pressure on us.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.097
Like, we can be in a good relationship

05:48.181 --> 05:51.642
and not be like trying to rip each other's
clothes off all the time, right?

05:51.726 --> 05:54.479
Ooh! The edible bra I bought
for tonight got delivered.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.439
-Sorry, Fab.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.443
All right. My room is ready for action.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.445
It looks like a low-key brothel.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.864
I'm talking scented candles,
silk pillowcases,

06:04.947 --> 06:06.574
a scarf draped over my lamp.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.701
It's so dimly lit, I ran into a door.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.787
-Oh, that is hot.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.290
Well, I don't think Devi's the only person
who's gonna have a spicy evening

06:15.291 --> 06:17.210
'cause I brought Brain Cranker.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.338
Oh, Fab, that game takes,
like, four hours,

06:20.421 --> 06:22.715
and the instructions are so complicated.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.385
What if we played, like, spin the bottle?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.596
Well, well, there's also a spinner
in Brain Cranker,

06:28.679 --> 06:31.516
and it tells you whether you have
to act out a historical event

06:31.599 --> 06:32.517
or do long division.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.186
Hello?

06:35.269 --> 06:36.270
Hey.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.156
Cool. I love Brain Cranker.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.616
Hi, I'm Addison.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.659
I Flabby.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.494
Fabiola.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.913
Hey. And you guys remember Parker
from the debate tournament.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.081
Of course.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.126
Hi, everybody.
Who's ready to get their game on?

06:58.209 --> 06:59.919
Wait, this is an actual game night?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.338
I thought that was just
what you're telling your parents.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.132
Oh. Um, no.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.717
But it is like an edgy game night.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.887
Like, you can put swear words down
in Scrabble if you want.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.265
-They're in the Scrabble dictionary.
-Shut up, Fabiola.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.225
Whatever. As long as there's booze.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.645
Yep. Coming right up. One moment, please.

07:18.729 --> 07:22.275
Crap. I was so focused on getting candles
and stuff for my sexy bedroom,

07:22.358 --> 07:25.278
I forgot all about alcohol.
Did you guys happen to bring anything?

07:25.361 --> 07:27.238
I have a travel size mouthwash in my bag.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.407
-I'll text Trent.
-Mmm.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.870
Hi, liquor is en route,
but while we're waiting,

07:33.953 --> 07:36.706
there is an old three-liter
of Mountain Dew in back of the fridge.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.209
The bubbles are gone, but the sugar
and caffeine could really mess you up.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.588
Does your mom at least have any pills?

07:43.671 --> 07:48.301
Uh… I know for sure she has a huge box
of Imodium from Costco.

07:48.926 --> 07:53.347
Guys, don't worry. I have something
way more exciting than booze.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.520
Then, if you pick a Mr. Whistler card,
one person whistles

07:59.604 --> 08:01.981
while the other team
has to sculpt a clue out of clay.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.275
Ugh! When you said
you had something more fun than booze,

08:04.358 --> 08:05.485
I thought you meant whippets.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.820
Uh, Eleanor,
the booze should be on its way, right?

08:07.904 --> 08:11.407
Yes, it should be,
but in a fun little twist,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.285
Trent's ID was confiscated
at the liquor store.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.829
Okay. Mattie's having
a party in the Hills.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.664
Can we please just go to that?

08:18.748 --> 08:21.375
You know I can't be sober
with my feelings right now.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.420
No, no, no, no. Don't leave.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.006
I'm so sorry, but Parker's parents
are getting divorced,

08:27.089 --> 08:28.382
and he's staying with me tonight,

08:28.466 --> 08:30.426
and I think I just have to do
what he wants.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.137
But I wanted us to have some alone time.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.141
Well, yeah, I obviously want that too,
but I'm kind of in a bind here.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.559
Dude, let's go.

08:39.101 --> 08:39.977
I'm so sorry, Devi.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.187
Okay. Bye.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.897
<i> Devi was 0 for 2.</i>

08:42.980 --> 08:46.776
<i>She hadn't gotten closer</i>
<i>to either Des's friends or Des's body,</i>

08:46.859 --> 08:50.988
<i>and now she would be forced</i>
<i>to endure a sober game of Brain Cranker.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:53.616
-Hey.
-Paxton?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.868
-What's up, everyone?
-And Trent.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.411
Paxton came to my rescue.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.748
The liquor store wouldn't take my ID
even though it's my Aunt Judy's license,

09:00.831 --> 09:02.959
and she and I look exactly alike.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.044
-Boom.

09:06.128 --> 09:09.340
Yes, Malibu.
This stuff always makes me puke.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.801
Paxton, you're my hero.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.679
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.392
All right, art tutor. I'm here.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.518
Tutor away.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.395
Show me how to draw better or whatever.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.605
Wow. Sounds like
you've come with an open mind

09:24.689 --> 09:26.232
and are ready to respect what I do.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.359
Come on, you have to admit
this is bullshit, right?

09:28.442 --> 09:31.195
Like I could just write Banksy on this
and sell it for a million bucks.

09:31.279 --> 09:35.950
Well, then, you'd be arrested for fraud,
and no, I don't think art is bullshit.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.160
I'd actually like to be an artist someday,

09:38.244 --> 09:41.872
so your attitude is pretty insulting,
and now I'm going to leave.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.708
No. Margot, I'm sorry.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.627
I really don't know how to do this.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.129
Okay? I need help.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.548
Oh, like you mean you need tutoring?

09:50.631 --> 09:54.760
Ugh, fine. Yes. I need tutoring.
I suck at drawing.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.556
First of all, you don't suck at drawing.
Your drawing sucks because you don't care.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.975
What am I supposed to care about?
It's a pear. It's meaningless.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.686
It's only meaningless
if you don't give it any meaning.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.939
-You need to express yourself through it.
-How? I have nothing in common with it.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.983
And I will kill you
if you say my body type.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.444
Just chill out and look at the pear

10:11.527 --> 10:13.654
and try and find
some sort of emotional connection.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.908
-What do you feel?
-Hungry.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.453
All right. I… I don't know.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.080
I guess it looks a little sad and bruised.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.207
Good start. What else?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.377
Kind of lonely and exposed.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.339
You know, like everyone's staring
at him and judging him.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.008
Okay. Hold on to that feeling.

10:34.675 --> 10:35.509
Now draw.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.348
I love when she does that.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.475
Not gonna lie,
Brain Cranker friggin' ruled.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.060
See. Told ya.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.520
So, what should we play next? Celebrity?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.106
-Ooh, yeah.
-Yes, everyone, write down some names,

10:49.190 --> 10:52.276
and please don't make them
Vaudeville actors from the 1800s

10:52.360 --> 10:53.778
that no one's ever heard of.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.947
Hey, how do you spell Ratajkowski?

10:57.031 --> 11:00.993
I don't think Phoebe would appreciate that
that's the first person you thought of.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.245
Actually, Phoebe loves Emrata.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.081
She has her pregnancy photo
up in her locker…

11:06.290 --> 11:07.375
…but also, we broke up.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.126
Oh, you did?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.754
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.548
Yeah. A couple of weeks ago.
It was for the best.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.719
She was nice, but I just think I need
someone who challenges me, you know?

11:18.803 --> 11:19.929
Well, I finished my names.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.682
Is there like a bowl or a hat
or something I could put them in.

11:22.765 --> 11:26.060
-Maybe, Paxton, you can go get one?
-No, it's okay. I'll go grab one.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.020
And I'll grab more drinks.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.439
Trent, babe, you want
another whiskey and Fruit Loops?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.401
Yes, please. It's kind of like boba.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.569
Hey, your party's gorgina.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.279
Everyone's having a blast.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.533
You want to steal Des away
for a sensuous embrace? Now's the time.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.910
You're right. We should get up there.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.037
I want enough time with him
before my mom gets home,

11:45.121 --> 11:47.123
and also, I should check on

11:47.206 --> 11:48.874
all those burning candles
I left unattended.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.253
May I just say, you really are different
in this relationship?

11:52.336 --> 11:54.672
You're like much more at ease
and confident.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.508
I know. I think it's because Des
goes to a different school.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.969
Like, he doesn't know
Sherman Oaks dork Devi.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.263
He only knows after-hours, cool Devi

12:02.346 --> 12:05.266
who's fun and definitely wasn't listed
with the teachers in the yearbook.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.726
For the record,

12:06.809 --> 12:09.812
-I also think Sherman Oaks Devi is fun.
-Thanks, El.

12:09.895 --> 12:13.190
Now, go explore each other's bodies,
and tell me everything after.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.818
Ew, but also sure.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.948
I'll be right there. Trent likes me
to pick out the green Fruit Loops.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.450
Okay.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.577
Ah! Okay. This one's easy.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.455
He's the host of the National Geographic
docuseries, <i>Welcome to Earth</i>,

12:27.538 --> 12:29.582
-about our planet's diverse ecosystem.
-Will Smith.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.916
Yes.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.753
Babe, why didn't you say <i>Fresh Prince</i>
or Jaden and Willow's dad?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
Oh, those would've been good.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.716
Hey, do you want to go upstairs?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.718
-Uh, yes.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.721
Wait, where did Parker go?

12:43.804 --> 12:45.765
No, I'm staying with Des tonight

12:45.848 --> 12:48.225
'cause I don't want
to see you or Mom right now.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.352
-What do you care if I'm drunk?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.146
<i>Turned out the racket they'd heard</i>

12:52.229 --> 12:56.650
<i>was from an actual racket that happened</i>
<i>to be very important to Devi.</i>

12:56.734 --> 12:59.069
Look at this, <i>kanna.</i>

13:01.363 --> 13:04.492
Daddy bought a piece
of tennis history on eBay.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.036
John McEnroe was the last player

13:07.119 --> 13:09.538
to ever win Wimbledon
with a wooden racket.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.874
And that was his racket that won?

13:12.458 --> 13:17.296
No, this was a backup racket in his bag,
but still, it was his.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.632
It is now my most prized possession.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.760
Even more than your PlayStation
I can't tell Mommy about?

13:22.843 --> 13:26.305
Yes. Also, maybe
don't tell Mommy about this.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.432
-It wasn't cheap.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.021
Parker, can I please just--

13:34.104 --> 13:37.650
When I asked to leave Archery Club,
you said this isn't a family of quitters.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.819
-So why do you just get to quit on Mom?
-Ow!

13:39.902 --> 13:43.322
-Easy, Parker. Devi, you okay?
-Give me the racket, bro.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.575
You can't just go messing with
other people's stuff. This is important.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.911
Then why is it just sitting
in a pile of junk?

13:58.212 --> 13:59.255
Hey.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.923
You okay?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.842
I saw you run up the stairs.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.969
Hey, yeah, I-I'm fine.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.305
Uh, Parker was just drunk
and was hitting things in the garage

14:08.389 --> 14:11.141
with my dad's old racket,
and I flipped out.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.352
I'm sorry.
That kid seemed like a tool.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.399
So are you, like,
about to do a séance in here,

14:18.482 --> 14:21.652
or are these candles
for the new boyfriend?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.405
I was trying to be romantic or whatever.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.533
Hold up.
How come you never did this for me?

14:27.616 --> 14:28.951
I love a lamp scarf.

14:29.034 --> 14:33.038
I don't know.
I'd be worried you'd think I was lame.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.832
Nah, this is… this is cool.

14:35.457 --> 14:39.336
The candles are,
like, sexy, but also relaxing.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.048
Do you want to come downstairs?

14:43.632 --> 14:45.843
We're starting trivia,
and I'd love someone

14:45.926 --> 14:47.636
who's not Trent to be on my team.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.722
Sure.

14:52.975 --> 14:53.893
Wait, hold up.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.228
What? Is my nose ring bleeding again?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.646
Ugh! It will not heal.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.231
No, you just--

15:02.484 --> 15:03.736
Hi.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.532
Parker just wanted to apologize.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.826
I'm sorry I was hitting stuff
with your racket.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.244
That was inconsiderate of me.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.955
I should've been more respectful
of your old trash.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.498
Thank you.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.210
Listen, I think we're just gonna head out.
So, uh, see you.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.758
Hmm. Two truths and a lie.

15:25.841 --> 15:30.679
I own a pet goat, I hate peas,
and my godfather is Bill Nye.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.222
The Science Guy?

15:32.306 --> 15:33.682
Addison, don't play.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.811
If your godfather is really Bill Nye,
you are required to tell me right now.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.982
No, I wish, but sadly that is the lie.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.734
So, you own a goat?

15:43.817 --> 15:45.527
Yeah, but he acts more like a dog.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.115
Addison, we're heading out.

15:50.199 --> 15:54.370
-Well, I really liked meeting you both.
-I really liked us both meeting you too.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.918
So, what should we do? Dominos?

16:03.545 --> 16:04.713
I want you to kiss me.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.798
Huh?

16:05.881 --> 16:07.841
Hit me with the best kiss you got.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.095
-Right now?
-Yep.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.312
-Fab, you think we're just friends?
-What?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.856
No. What do you mean?

16:23.524 --> 16:28.195
Our first kiss was so spontaneous
and surprising that it felt exciting.

16:29.154 --> 16:33.742
But ever since we started dating,
it's kind of been whomp, whomp.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.912
-And then I saw you with Addison--
-No, nothing is going on there.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.874
The way you're blushing so hard right now
makes me think there should be.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.005
You're the best person I know,

16:46.088 --> 16:48.966
so I… I really, really wanted us to fit.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.094
You are the best person I know.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.263
That's why I wanted to be your girlf too.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.684
But honestly,
I got to take a break from you bookworms.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.937
I think I just need
to find a nice, hot jock.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.817
So can we please
keep being actual friends?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.862
Of course, we'll stay friends.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.155
You're my girl, Fab.

17:11.822 --> 17:12.990
In a platonic way.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.712
<i> Are you okay? You left so quickly.</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:33.844
It was amazing. Hello.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.305
-Hi. How was Shen Yun?
-Very interesting.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.099
I can safely say
it was the most acrobatic display

17:39.183 --> 17:41.435
of anti-communist propaganda
I've ever seen.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.437
It was quite surprising to see 100 women

17:43.520 --> 17:45.689
doing back handsprings
across Karl Marx's grave.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.858
-Don't worry, <i>kanna</i>,

17:47.941 --> 17:49.943
I saved you three Junior Mints.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.280
Thanks, <i>Pati</i>.
I'm glad you guys had a nice time.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.449
How about you? Did you win game night?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.869
No, I was actually one of the losers.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.996
What did you lose? Boggle?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.624
It's too many letters. Who has the time?

18:06.585 --> 18:07.795
Thank you again, Ms. Nuni,

18:07.878 --> 18:10.464
for being generous enough
to give me a redo.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.382
I hope I did a little better this time.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.801
Let's take a look.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.886
What an evolution.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.973
Do you see how alive this pear is
compared to the other one?

18:20.557 --> 18:21.391
I actually do.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.435
Powerful work, young man.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.686
Thank you, Ms. Nuni.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.441
-Hey, don't you wanna know your grade?
-Oh yeah. Yes, of course.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.567
A-plus.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.325
Did you almost forget
to ask about your grade? Wow!

18:38.408 --> 18:42.371
-What did one night of drawing do to you?
-Yeah. I don't know.That was a first.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.916
You know, I do feel more relaxed today
after our tutoring sesh.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.919
-Art's sort of therapeutic, huh?
-Yeah. It can be.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.005
Especially if you're
kind of a repressed douche.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.633
Rude, and I'm not repressed anymore.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.928
Okay? That pear changed me.
I'm, like, artsy and emotional now.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.056
Oh, well, buckle up
because today we're drawing a spatula,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.475
so you might want
to get your tissues ready.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.561
Yeah, 'cause spatulas are sad as shit.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.816
Devi, why'd you go quiet?

19:10.899 --> 19:15.195
Are you upset again that I won't leak
the names of my celebrity clients?

19:15.279 --> 19:16.113
I took an oath.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.824
I know. I saw Kiernan Shipka
leave your office last week,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.285
but no, it's not that.

19:21.368 --> 19:25.581
Okay. You said your boyfriend left
after seeing you with Paxton.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.500
Are you worried
he misunderstood what he saw?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.752
Yeah. I am.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
But I think I can fix that.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.925
My dad had this old tennis racket,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.886
and it was his favorite thing…

19:39.469 --> 19:42.764
…and I didn't remember it existed

19:42.848 --> 19:45.601
until a kid was messing around
with it yesterday.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.935
Let's unpack that.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.855
How did it make you feel
when you saw it again?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.940
I don't know. Bad.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.569
Like, I let myself get
so caught up having fun with Des,

19:55.652 --> 19:58.614
I forgot to be the sad girl
who lost her dad,

19:59.239 --> 20:03.202
and I didn't even notice his stuff
got tossed onto an old junk box.

20:04.161 --> 20:08.624
Devi, what I'm hearing is
that you've been happier lately

20:08.707 --> 20:11.960
and experiencing
less frequent waves of grief.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.631
That means you're healing
and getting to be a kid again.

20:16.506 --> 20:19.343
And that doesn't mean
you love your dad any less.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.888
It still feels messed up.
Like, somehow I'm dissing him.

20:22.971 --> 20:27.601
Well, it sounds like that racket
was pretty special to the both of you.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.687
Maybe you could find some way to honor it.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.774
When my Siamese passed, look,

20:33.857 --> 20:35.901
I took her collar
and had it dipped in gold

20:35.984 --> 20:38.403
so that I can wear it as a little bangle.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.324
Devi, did I lose you again?

20:42.407 --> 20:46.453
No, I'm just so shocked
to learn that you're a cat person.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.038
Like, wow!

20:48.121 --> 20:50.749
This changes everything.
Did you shop or adopt?

20:50.832 --> 20:52.334
No, you're not gonna tell me.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.087
I do feel better though, Doc. Thank you.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.213
You're welcome.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.093
<i> Devi realized her dad's treasure</i>
<i>didn't have to stay lost,</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:04.554
<i>and while she can't dip it in gold</i>
<i>like some bougie cat collar,</i>

21:05.138 --> 21:08.141
<i>she could hang it where she'd be able</i>
<i>to honor it every day.</i>

21:11.853 --> 21:15.607
<i>Yeah, no one thought a thumbtack</i>
<i>was the right way to hang that.</i>

21:19.987 --> 21:22.322
Oh, Devi, what are you doing here?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.992
Did your mom change her mind
about taking the probiotics?

21:25.075 --> 21:26.910
Thank God. She's not regular enough.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.329
I don't know about any of that.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.873
-I actually needed to talk to Des.
-Oh.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.669
Um, he accidentally took
my protractor home after our study sesh.

21:35.752 --> 21:39.089
Okay. Uh, Des, Devi's here to see you.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.094
-Hey.
-I'm gonna head to the store.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.943
I know it looked like you walked in
on me and Paxton doing something sus,

22:00.027 --> 22:01.945
but I swear we're just friends.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.698
He was cradling your face.
Friends don't cradle.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.742
He wasn't cradling my face.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.329
He was wiping the snot off my face,
which friends can do,

22:10.829 --> 22:12.831
but I promise you can trust me.

22:12.914 --> 22:17.044
No, I know. I was just feeling
kind of insecure the other night.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.420
Why?

22:19.671 --> 22:22.132
Because your ex is obviously
this handsome dude,

22:22.215 --> 22:24.176
and you're this super cool,
beautiful girl.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.554
-I'm sorry.
-What? What did I say?

22:27.637 --> 22:32.434
Nothing. It's just no one has
ever described me that way, like ever.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.186
How do people usually describe you?

22:35.812 --> 22:38.482
Des, I have to tell you something.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.151
I'm, like, a loser.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.363
Like, I am very unpopular at my school,

22:45.030 --> 22:47.032
so you have nothing to worry about.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.243
I'm surprised me being on debate
didn't give that away.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.996
Well, the debate team
is the cool clique at my school.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.539
-Hmm.
-We bully the jocks.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.208
I did notice that you guys

22:56.291 --> 22:59.294
had uncharacteristically attractive people
on your debate team.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.880
But anyway, you're with a dork.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.673
No, I'm not.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.009
But I stand by my initial analysis.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.553
-You're amazing.

23:09.930 --> 23:10.847
And you're hot.

23:12.015 --> 23:12.933
Well…

23:13.975 --> 23:17.437
Thank you. I also think you're hot.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.147
Thank you.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.796
Des, honey,
do you know where my credit card--

23:42.879 --> 23:45.549
<i>No need</i>
<i>to hang this moment on the wall</i>

23:45.632 --> 23:49.052
<i>because it will be seared</i>
<i>into Devi's memory forever.</i>
