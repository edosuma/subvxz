WEBVTT

00:02.792 --> 00:05.875
[laughs]
Give me a "C"!

00:05.959 --> 00:07.959
-C!
-Give me an "O"!

00:08.041 --> 00:09.917
-O!
-Give me--

00:10.000 --> 00:12.667
Dad, we've got school.
How many more letters are there gonna be?

00:12.750 --> 00:16.166
I was going to spell "Coler,"
as in Robert Lincoln Coler.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.083
The music critic?

00:17.166 --> 00:19.291
The most respected music critic
in the business.

00:19.375 --> 00:23.834
I hate that guy.
He's so pedantic, pompous, pretentious.

00:23.917 --> 00:26.208
It looks like someone's been reading
their word-a-day calendar.

00:27.959 --> 00:30.583
Yeah, well, he loved your last album.

00:30.709 --> 00:33.000
That Coler?
He's so cool.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.917
-Some would say sagacious.
-Watch your mouth.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.166
It means "shrewd."
May 23rd.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.166
I thought it was impossible
to get an interview with that guy.

00:40.417 --> 00:41.583
Yeah, it is.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.542
It is, which is why it's so unbelievably
awesome I got us an interview!

00:44.625 --> 00:46.000
-No way.
-Awesome.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.583
[laughs]
Let's celebrate.

00:48.667 --> 00:51.291
-Five-second dance party. Go.
-[dance music playing]

00:51.375 --> 00:52.792
And we're dancing.
Let's dance it.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.834
Mom, Dad's dancing again!

00:54.917 --> 00:57.208
Come on, you guys.
All right, we'll do more dancing later.

00:58.792 --> 00:59.834
Robert Coler.

OK, OK, you wore me down.

02:01.583 --> 02:05.458
You can have your present now.
Happy birthday.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.625
Thank you.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.834
What is it? Is it chocolate?
I bet it's music.

02:08.917 --> 02:09.875
Is it a scarf?
Two scarves?

02:09.959 --> 02:11.875
I totally love scarves.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.041
Oh, this is my 10th birthday.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.959
Joe, Nick, Kevin and me, we just...
we sat around in our pajamas

02:18.041 --> 02:21.166
playing that board game Dopey Doctor,
and we drank hot chocolate

02:21.250 --> 02:22.458
with those little mini marshmallows in it.

02:22.542 --> 02:23.583
Aww.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.750
Macy, is this... is this you?

02:29.166 --> 02:31.291
I kind of added myself in.

02:31.375 --> 02:35.333
I know I didn't know you guys back then,
but if I did, I'd be right there, right?

02:36.333 --> 02:37.959
-Of course.
-Yay.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.417
-Oh, thank you so much. I love it.
-You're welcome.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.750
So... what are the guys doing

02:44.834 --> 02:47.000
-for your birthday this year?
-Oh, well, you know,

02:47.083 --> 02:49.125
they haven't said anything about it yet.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.458
-Uh-huh.
-So...

02:50.917 --> 02:52.500
I'm sure they're throwing
an awesome party,

02:52.583 --> 02:55.291
-So find something great to wear.
-Oh, I can't wait.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.041
I'm so excited, I can't even sit.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.083
See?

03:00.792 --> 03:02.417
Nope, not gonna happen.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.583
I have a huge surprise for you.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.959
-You do?
-We are gonna remember this day forever.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.917
-We are?
-At 6:00,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.542
Jonas has an interview
with Robert Lincoln Coler.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.125
He's who?

03:14.208 --> 03:17.083
I mean, that's great.
He's huge.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.250
Yeah, so we need you to come over early
and help out with all the wardrobe.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.041
Kevin thinks we should wear leather vests.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.250
-Yeah, that could work.
-With no shirts?

03:24.333 --> 03:26.166
I'm gonna get there early.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.083
Perfect.
I've gotta go... science.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.667
If you get there late,
you have to sit in front

03:29.750 --> 03:32.792
and Mr. Engel's a spitter.
Bye.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.375
Joe forgot your birthday.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.458
No. No, he didn't.

03:39.542 --> 03:42.667
They do this to me every year.
They try to, like, psyche me out.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.291
Obviously, he's throwing a surprise party.

03:45.375 --> 03:49.000
-How excited are you?
-It's just a birthday.

03:51.125 --> 03:54.750
-OK, maybe a little excited.
-[both squeal]

04:03.834 --> 04:05.750
-What's this?
-Oh, nothing.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.667
Just my "Hottie of the Year" award.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.709
I've been meaning
to hang this thing up for weeks.

04:09.792 --> 04:13.125
And you just decided to put it up
right now before the interview?

04:14.959 --> 04:17.166
-What are these?
-Oh, these old things?

04:17.250 --> 04:19.917
Just a couple of my song writing awards.
No biggie.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.875
Well, this one's a biggie.

04:23.417 --> 04:24.959
Got it in first grade:

04:25.041 --> 04:28.166
"Best Melody
in an Original Alphabet Song."

04:29.125 --> 04:31.333
-[doorbell rings]
-That must be Stella and Macy.

04:31.417 --> 04:34.208
-I'll get it.
-[sighs] Nick, I cannot believe

04:34.291 --> 04:35.500
how self-centered you guys are being.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.959
How about we show a little modesty?

04:42.125 --> 04:45.291
What? I've been getting into
hip-hop fashion.

04:45.375 --> 04:49.250
And you just decided to turn your
Golden Shredder award into a necklace?

04:49.333 --> 04:54.166
Word to your mother...
who also happens to be my mother.

04:56.583 --> 04:57.792
Hey, guys, come on in.

04:57.875 --> 05:00.208
Wow. You guys look amazing.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.875
Thank you. It's just something I threw on.

05:02.959 --> 05:07.166
You know, casual enough for hanging out
but dressy enough for... celebration.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.166
-OK.
-This dress cost me a fortune

05:10.250 --> 05:12.208
and I can hardly breathe,
but I look really good.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.959
-Let's go upstairs.
-OK.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.667
What are you doing?

05:19.041 --> 05:22.875
I always like to look good
when I go upstairs.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.667
Stella's coming upstairs.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.208
Here she comes.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.166
I'm coming up the stairs.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.417
Just coming up the stairs.

05:36.542 --> 05:43.250
-Oh my gosh, this is such a sur... prise.
-What's such a surprise?

05:43.333 --> 05:47.834
I mean, there are no decorations,
food or drinks.

05:47.917 --> 05:51.083
No, Coler wanted to see
what our life was really like at home.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.834
Which means we need to keep it real.
Oh.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.041
So, you're really being
interviewed by Coler?

05:57.125 --> 05:58.917
[sighs]

06:00.625 --> 06:03.000
If we weren't really being
interviewed by Coler,

06:03.083 --> 06:04.291
would Kevin be dressed like that?

06:05.291 --> 06:07.208
Stella, can you please go fix that?

06:15.917 --> 06:19.542
Give me a little bit of the h-i-s-t-o-r-y.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.458
Why? because the fans want to know.

06:22.542 --> 06:25.083
[Kevin]
Uh, well, you know...

06:25.166 --> 06:27.000
Dad of Jonas, are you OK?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.083
Fine, fine. [clears throat]
I'm fine.

06:29.166 --> 06:33.333
It's just a good interview with Coler
could take this band to a whole new level,

06:33.417 --> 06:35.959
and a bad one could destroy everything

06:36.041 --> 06:38.250
I have spent
my entire life working towards.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.959
They're gonna do great,
and then we can go out and celebrate.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.333
You know, I bet even
if they don't do great,

06:44.417 --> 06:46.083
we'll go out and celebrate.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.625
Did anyone mention anything
about celebrating?

06:48.750 --> 06:51.500
Matisse, may I please... please, some tea.

06:51.583 --> 06:58.083
Kevin, Nick and Joe,
two world tours, millions of fans...

06:58.166 --> 06:59.959
I mean, how... how does that...

07:00.041 --> 07:02.125
How does that make you feel?

07:02.208 --> 07:05.834
-Hot, hot, hot, hot!
-OK, fair enough.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.500
Where does all of your success come from?

07:08.583 --> 07:10.792
-My pants.
-Don't you think

07:10.875 --> 07:13.500
-you're being a little full of yourself?
-No, no.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.834
"My Pants" is actually the first song
we ever wrote together.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.542
It wasn't that good,
but it had that core Jonas sound.

07:18.625 --> 07:22.125
That's why we say
we owe all our success to "My Pants."

07:24.125 --> 07:27.583
Moving on.
Let's rap about touring.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.792
All right?

07:29.875 --> 07:34.125
I'd like to get the Jonas take
on life on the road.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.291
What's your favorite part?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.333
-Oh, the fans.
-Definitely the fans.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.083
The fans.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.875
And also...

07:44.917 --> 07:48.041
I love the tiny shampoo bottles
you get at the hotels.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.083
You know, I like to be in the shower,
and pretend I'm a giant monster and go,

07:50.166 --> 07:52.542
[low voice] "Oh, watch out, tiny shampoo!
You will die!"

07:52.625 --> 07:56.083
[high voice] "Oh, tell soap I love her!"
[low voice] "No, you have no chance!"

07:56.166 --> 07:57.917
[roars]

08:04.667 --> 08:06.959
[laughing]

08:08.375 --> 08:13.083
Dig it. I have tiny shampoo bottles
from every hotel I've ever been in.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.083
-Me too.
-Me too.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.417
I have conditioner as well.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.750
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.

08:25.667 --> 08:31.041
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
I found you guys quite perspicacious.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.417
That means "insightful."

08:33.458 --> 08:35.667
Or was it "to sweat like a cow"?

08:35.750 --> 08:37.625
[chuckles]

08:38.792 --> 08:40.542
-Great job, guys.
-[exhales]

08:40.625 --> 08:42.709
So, I thought that went really great.
What are we doing now?

08:42.792 --> 08:44.750
Excellent question. Stella.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.583
What are we doing on this
very special evening?

08:46.667 --> 08:48.208
I don't know about you guys,

08:48.291 --> 08:51.000
but showing my better side all day
has got me exhausted.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.291
I'm going to bed.
Good night, guys.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.375
Yeah, I'm wiped. Have a good night, guys.
See you soon.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.083
Yeah, after three hours,
even I'm tired of talking about myself.

09:00.083 --> 09:04.000
Oh, wait, I almost forgot.
Don't forget your purse.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.000
They... they forgot my birthday.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.041
I can't believe they did that.
I'm gonna go yell at them.

09:16.125 --> 09:20.291
-No, I don't want you to yell at them.
-Good, 'cause I could never yell at them.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.083
-I guess I'll see you tomorrow?
-Mm-hmm.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.125
Happy birthday, dear Stella.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.625
Happy birthday to you.

09:29.834 --> 09:30.917
Thanks.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.834
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.500
[door opens, closes]

09:38.542 --> 09:40.208
[electricity crackles]

09:40.291 --> 09:41.583
What?

09:44.542 --> 09:46.333
I knew it.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.208
Oh! Hey, Stella.
I didn't know you were still here.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.917
I blew a fuse plugging in my hot comb.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.792
I'll get this fixed in a jiff.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.333
[door opens]

10:00.417 --> 10:04.166
Happy... birthday to me.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.458
-[door opens]
-[thudding]

10:07.542 --> 10:10.875
-[Stella] Ow! Ouch!
-[door closes]

10:31.375 --> 10:32.959
Something on your mind, Macy?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.959
You know, if I didn't
like you guys so much,

10:36.041 --> 10:40.166
I wouldn't like you guys so much.
You forgot Stella's birthday.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.375
That's impossible.
Her birthday's after Joe's,

10:43.458 --> 10:46.125
which is before mine.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.041
-Mm-hmm.
-The seventh?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.458
Which was yesterday!
[gasps]

10:53.041 --> 10:55.542
OK, we need to find Stella
and apologize immediately.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.667
Oh, she's gonna be really mad.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.917
Oh, you know,
I think I got it covered.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.959
-[Kevin] <i>Uh, Stella?</i>
-What... what's going on?

11:17.125 --> 11:18.875
We're really sorry.

11:18.959 --> 11:21.625
We can't believe we forgot your birthday.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.792
Hold up.
Is that what this is about?

11:24.875 --> 11:26.625
You forgot Stella's birthday?

11:26.709 --> 11:28.583
You're on your own.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.792
-Please don't hurt us!
-Guys, it's fine. It's OK.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.375
Look, I admit I was
a little mad at you last night,

11:36.458 --> 11:39.625
but then I started thinking about it,
and your lives are so busy.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.208
I can understand forgetting
the little things.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.375
You're not a little thing.
You're Stella.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.667
How about we throw you
a surprise party at the zoo?

11:48.417 --> 11:51.250
Oops. You know what?
We're gonna do that next year.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.583
I... I'm just gonna stop talking now.

11:55.667 --> 11:59.000
Or we can celebrate the way we did
when we were little kids:

11:59.083 --> 12:02.250
drink hot cocoa
and play board games in our pajamas.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.250
How do you always know
exactly what I want?

12:07.041 --> 12:10.000
OK, I'm giving you guys one more chance.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.625
I know how busy you are.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.875
Sometimes you just have to
stop being rock stars.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.250
OK, pajama party it is.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.917
Oh, and I'll take
a rain check on the zoo...

12:22.583 --> 12:24.041
Unless it's the London Zoo.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.792
I mean, you are rock stars.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.166
-Thank you very much.
-[door opens]

12:35.375 --> 12:37.333
-Hey, give me a "C"!
-"Coler."

12:37.417 --> 12:40.500
What? Oh, yeah.
Anyway, I just talked to him.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.417
Did he say anything about my Hottie award?

12:42.500 --> 12:46.291
No. No, no, but he was so happy
with the interview

12:46.375 --> 12:48.250
that he's gonna make
you guys the cover story.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.709
-Oh! Awesome.
-Awesome.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.917
So nothing about the Hottie award?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.291
-He's gonna be here in an hour.
-In an hour?

12:54.375 --> 12:55.917
-Yeah.
-He can't come in an hour.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.542
Stella's coming over
to celebrate her birthday.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.417
Well, you can't bail on Coler.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.375
Look the last band to cancel
an interview with this guy

13:01.458 --> 13:03.333
-was the Happy Teens.
-[boys] Who?

13:03.417 --> 13:07.291
Exactly. All right,
now I know Stella will be disappointed,

13:07.375 --> 13:09.417
but she'll understand.
Do you want me to talk to her?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.208
I can be gentle but firm.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.083
No, no, you know what, we'll talk to her.
She's our friend.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.959
Ah, thank goodness.
That girl scares me.

13:16.750 --> 13:20.083
Guys, we can't cancel on Stella,
and we can't cancel on Coler.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.583
-There's no way out.
-It's the Happy Teens all over again.

13:22.667 --> 13:26.875
I have an idea. What if we do
the interview with Coler upstairs

13:26.959 --> 13:28.792
and Stella's birthday downstairs?

13:28.875 --> 13:30.458
But won't that make Stella mad?

13:30.542 --> 13:31.959
You know, taking away time
from her birthday party

13:32.041 --> 13:33.417
for some rock-star interview?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.583
Plus, Coler won't think
we're taking him seriously.

13:35.667 --> 13:36.917
No, not if they don't
know about each other.

13:37.000 --> 13:37.834
Keep talking.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.333
Look, we go back and forth:
upstairs, downstairs.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.291
-We've got poles. How hard could it be?
-Keep talking.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.792
-It's like we'll be in two places at once.
-Keep talking.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.208
-No, I'm done.
-Then stop talking.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.291
-Let's get ready.
-Let's do it.

13:55.667 --> 13:59.417
Today, I want to delve into your
personal lives a little bit, all right?

13:59.500 --> 14:03.375
I want to get into
the essence of your essence.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.208
[doorbell rings]

14:05.291 --> 14:07.917
Our Chinese food is here.
I'll be right back.

14:14.959 --> 14:17.375
-Oh, Macy, Stella, come on in.
-Hey.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.083
We are all dressed for the pajama party.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.625
Whoo!
Where are your pajamas?

14:23.709 --> 14:25.417
Oh, they're upstairs.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.709
-I was ironing them.
-[Kevin] Oh, oh, ooh! Joe!

14:28.792 --> 14:31.166
I think Kevin just touched the iron.
I'll be right back.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.709
-Hot! Hot!
-What did I miss?

14:36.792 --> 14:38.208
Oh, just having some tea.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.375
I was just asking your brothers

14:40.417 --> 14:44.250
how, with all of your success
and your commitments,

14:44.333 --> 14:47.625
you find time for, you know,
friends and school.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.917
How about I answer that
and you run downstairs?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.542
-Right.
-In your pajamas.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.542
-Right.
-Your pajamas?

14:54.625 --> 14:58.542
Um, was the song
that we wrote after "My Pants."

14:58.625 --> 15:01.917
-"Your Pajamas."
-Oh. Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.792
-We like to write about what we know.
-And what we wear.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.875
-All right, let's get this party started.
-Oh, my gosh.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.875
I can't believe you still have
this Dopey Doctor game.

15:15.959 --> 15:19.291
I mean, with the fake stethoscope,
and the fake casts and everything.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.750
I feel fake sick already.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.166
Well, it means a lot to me
that you guys are doing this.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.166
I mean, with all your
fame and success that you...

15:27.250 --> 15:30.583
-you still have time for me.
-Stella, you know how we feel about you.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.417
And tonight is all about Stella
and only Stella.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.625
A large order of Stella
with Stella on the side.

15:35.709 --> 15:38.375
-[Joe] Nick!
-Gotta run.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.083
And ever since then
I've been a boxer brief man.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.125
-I hope that answered your question.
-Well, actually, my question

15:47.208 --> 15:50.125
was about your favorite subject
in school, um...

15:50.208 --> 15:51.500
and I was asking him.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.500
[Stella] Hey, guys
ready for Dopey Doctor?

15:54.583 --> 15:58.375
-Who is that?
-That's our nutty nurse.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.166
I'm sure it's nothing.
You know, what, let me just go che...

16:02.250 --> 16:03.291
I'll be right back.

16:09.041 --> 16:12.000
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, aren't those Nick's pajamas?

16:12.083 --> 16:14.041
Um, not on Fridays.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.208
-Where are Joe and Nick?
-Doing the interview.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.166
What interview?
What am I talking about?

16:19.250 --> 16:22.291
[Nick]
Oh! Hot! Hot! Oh!

16:22.375 --> 16:25.375
Um, I should go.
Oh, look... ice!

16:28.625 --> 16:31.625
-Oh! Oh! Ah.

you are living the dream.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.542
OK, with all of your success

18:12.625 --> 18:17.166
how do you, as my friend Beyoncé
likes to say, keep it real?

18:17.750 --> 18:20.667
Well, keeping it real
is the most important thing for us.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.041
Friends and family come first.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.667
They... they always have
and they always will.

-OK.
-[Stella crying]

18:27.000 --> 18:28.375
Well, you could've fooled me,

for a little while.

18:32.875 --> 18:37.125
-Stella.
-Isn't that your stylist, Stella Malone?

18:37.959 --> 18:40.667
-Yeah.
-And didn't you tell me yesterday

18:40.750 --> 18:44.625
-that she was your best friend?
-Yesterday she was.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.959
Heavy.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.208
Very heavy.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.417
Stella, please forgive us.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.917
We know we messed up and we are so sorry.

Look, I understand
that you guys are busy,

19:12.125 --> 19:17.208
I do, and I can deal with that,
but trying to trick me?

19:17.875 --> 19:20.000
How could you ever think
that that was OK?

19:21.542 --> 19:26.083
This was the worst birthday of my life...
two days in a row.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.542
We're the worst best friends ever.

in the life of Jonas.

Stella, I know you probably
never want to see us again,

20:10.583 --> 20:12.166
which would be kind of hard since
we go to school together,

20:12.250 --> 20:14.000
-and you work with us...
-Unless you want to make

20:14.083 --> 20:16.542

in the Coler interview was

I could've ever asked for.
