00:04.610 --> 00:06.244
Devon is out of the spy business for good.

00:06.795 --> 00:08.796
Please don't say another mission, chuck.

00:09.548 --> 00:10.581
You're back!

00:10.632 --> 00:12.049
<i>I'm hannah.</i>

00:12.117 --> 00:13.618
If you ever find yourself in burbank,

00:13.685 --> 00:15.619
<i>My assistant manager owes me about</i>

00:15.671 --> 00:17.221
<i>A million and a half favors.</i>

00:26.598 --> 00:28.232
Stop the presses!

00:28.300 --> 00:30.151
Who is that? Vicky vale...

00:30.235 --> 00:32.436
: ¶ vicky vale! Vick, uh, vicky vale! ¶

00:32.503 --> 00:36.140

00:36.208 --> 00:39.310
<i>Do you remember when sarah first
walked into the buy more?</i>

00:39.378 --> 00:40.795
What was it like?

00:40.879 --> 00:42.580
Was it love at first sight?

00:58.230 --> 01:00.398
I don't know, but whatever it was,

01:00.465 --> 01:02.400
It changed my life forever. Why?

01:02.467 --> 01:03.484
No reason.

01:03.569 --> 01:04.635
Morning, guys.

01:04.686 --> 01:05.770
Hi.

01:05.821 --> 01:07.438
Hey. Morning.

01:08.824 --> 01:11.141
All right, everybody, back to work!

01:11.193 --> 01:15.145
Real taskmaster, that, uh, morgan.

01:15.197 --> 01:16.697
yeah, I can tell.

01:16.782 --> 01:18.115
So, my first day

01:18.166 --> 01:20.668
As a nerd herder-- any advice?

01:20.752 --> 01:21.986
Oh.

01:22.037 --> 01:23.371
Uh, let's see, well, let's start

01:23.455 --> 01:24.789
With the five-cent tour, shall we?

01:24.840 --> 01:27.124
I like to consider myself the jack hannah

01:27.175 --> 01:29.293
Of this untamed wilderness.

01:29.344 --> 01:30.461
Me, safe;

01:30.512 --> 01:32.546
Everyone else, very dangerous.

01:33.465 --> 01:34.465
Yeah, a little creepy.

01:34.533 --> 01:36.000
But I am sure

01:36.051 --> 01:37.301
That you will protect me.

01:37.352 --> 01:39.270
Indeed, indeed.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.389
You stay by us, sister; you'll be safe.

01:41.473 --> 01:42.523
Charles.

01:42.608 --> 01:43.674
Hannah, lester,

01:43.725 --> 01:44.775
Jeff.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.360
Two of the finest members

01:46.445 --> 01:47.979
Of our buy moron staff.

01:48.030 --> 01:49.647
<i>Hannah, namaste.</i>

01:52.150 --> 01:53.401
Nice.

01:55.220 --> 01:58.205
All right, why don't we
give jeff an opportunity

01:58.290 --> 01:59.540
To realize that he's in public?

01:59.625 --> 02:00.858
Thank you.

02:00.909 --> 02:03.661
So, I was going through the
nerd herd manual last night,

02:03.712 --> 02:06.697
And I have a few questions
about how to file an install.

02:06.748 --> 02:08.198
Let me get this straight.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.135
You went over the nerd herd
manual in your off time?

02:11.202 --> 02:12.870
Are you gonna be a problem employee?

02:12.921 --> 02:14.872
Look, I know this isn't my dream job,

02:14.923 --> 02:16.557
But I thought that while I'm here,

02:16.642 --> 02:19.209
I would be the best nerd herder you have.

02:19.261 --> 02:20.761
Well, as you probably saw,

02:20.846 --> 02:22.263
That's not an insurmountable goal.

02:22.347 --> 02:24.982
You must be pretty committed,
going to paris on an install?

02:25.050 --> 02:26.400
Yeah, uh, uh...

02:26.485 --> 02:29.553
Um, you know, about... About t
h-that whole paris thing-- can we

02:29.621 --> 02:30.988
Just keep that between the two of us?

02:31.056 --> 02:32.990
I don't want everyone
else getting jealous...

02:33.058 --> 02:34.742
Yogurt time.

02:34.826 --> 02:36.661
Oh, is it... Is it yogurt time already?

02:36.728 --> 02:38.228
Uh, yogurt, most important meal of the day.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.664
But don't worry,

02:39.731 --> 02:41.732
I will give you the full
chuck bartowski tutorial

02:41.783 --> 02:43.117
When I get back, I promise.

02:46.421 --> 02:48.172
I'm gonna totally hit that.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.591
May the best stalker win.

02:50.676 --> 02:51.959
Oops.

02:55.464 --> 02:57.631
Hey, where's shaw?

02:57.716 --> 02:59.433
Off grid on a covert mission.

02:59.518 --> 03:01.435
It's not your concern

03:01.520 --> 03:03.637
Where agent shaw is, mr. Bartowski.

03:03.722 --> 03:05.106
Oh, uh, that's actually

03:05.190 --> 03:07.308
<i>Agent bartowski no
w- I don't know if you heard,</i>

03:07.392 --> 03:09.810
But I completed my first
solo mish last week.

03:09.895 --> 03:11.896
Paris. International op.

03:13.315 --> 03:15.232
But I guess you probably have been briefed.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.951
We've traced a large sum of money

03:17.035 --> 03:19.269
From an offshore ring account
into a civilian account.

03:19.321 --> 03:20.538
I want to know why.

03:20.605 --> 03:22.640
What's the money for?

03:22.708 --> 03:25.076
The civilian's name is manoosh depak.

03:25.143 --> 03:26.711
Trained as a computer engineer,

03:26.778 --> 03:28.629
Dropped out of mit after his freshman year.

03:28.714 --> 03:30.815
Classic geek tragedy.

03:30.882 --> 03:31.949
Sound familiar?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.385
We sent a virus that destroyed the cpu

03:34.452 --> 03:37.154
Of his custom computer and
bought up every series eight cpu

03:37.222 --> 03:39.289
Within 30 miles.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.258
He'll come into the buy more to replace it.

03:41.309 --> 03:43.644
<i>Develop him as an asset,
agent bartowski.</i>

03:43.729 --> 03:46.180
Find out what he's doing for the ring.

03:47.682 --> 03:49.984
That's it? That's the whole... Mission?

03:50.068 --> 03:51.802
I'll have it done by lunch.

03:51.853 --> 03:53.187
Don't get cocky, bartowski.

03:53.272 --> 03:54.906
<i>One mish does not an agent make.</i>

03:54.973 --> 03:56.324
Chuck, you-you can't take this lightly.

03:56.408 --> 03:57.408
Developing an asset

03:57.476 --> 03:58.993
Is very tricky business.

03:59.078 --> 04:01.446
You need to insinuate
yourself into their life

04:01.497 --> 04:03.031
And have them trust you completely,

04:03.115 --> 04:06.084
Knowing that one day you're
probably gonna have to burn them.

04:06.151 --> 04:08.786
The trick is to find the hole in their life

04:08.837 --> 04:09.837
And fill it.

04:09.922 --> 04:11.172
With this manoosh loser,

04:11.257 --> 04:13.124
He's a loner, friendless.

04:13.192 --> 04:15.760
And the asset has entered the store.

04:15.827 --> 04:17.795
Showtime, bartowski.

04:17.846 --> 04:19.130
Don't worry, guys.

04:19.197 --> 04:21.349
Piece of cake.

04:23.469 --> 04:25.019
"mish."

04:27.856 --> 04:29.107
<i>Chuck's not ready for an asset.</i>

04:29.174 --> 04:31.276
We're advancing him too quickly.

04:31.343 --> 04:32.527
I'm worried.

04:32.611 --> 04:34.545
Your job's not to worry, it's to train.

04:34.613 --> 04:35.613
Three o'clock.

04:35.681 --> 04:37.682
He's with the newest buy moron.

04:39.785 --> 04:41.352
Can I help you, sir?

04:41.403 --> 04:42.353
Chuck, I got it.

04:42.404 --> 04:43.488
No, really, let me help.

04:43.539 --> 04:45.039
She's new here, still in training.

04:45.124 --> 04:46.291
Actually, I'd rather have her help me.

04:46.358 --> 04:47.492
No, chuck, I'm ready.

04:47.543 --> 04:48.993
I can handle a simple sale. It's okay.

04:49.044 --> 04:51.212
Hannah, no sales are simple.

04:51.297 --> 04:52.864
But don't worry, you will get your chance

04:52.931 --> 04:54.399
To shine as soon as you

04:54.466 --> 04:55.633
Are ready.

04:55.701 --> 04:56.918
Okay.

04:59.505 --> 05:00.888
Ah, sorry about that.

05:00.973 --> 05:02.390
Alone at last.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.309
What can I do you for?

05:04.376 --> 05:05.543
Nothing.

05:05.594 --> 05:07.412
Now that you ruined my
flow with that hottie.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.880
Let me ring you up personally.

05:09.932 --> 05:11.899
Uh, are you from around here?
Is that a burbankian

05:11.984 --> 05:13.718
Accent I detect?

05:13.769 --> 05:14.736
Woodland hills.

05:14.820 --> 05:16.354
See? I knew I heard

05:16.405 --> 05:18.523
The familiar twang of
the san fernando valley.

05:18.574 --> 05:20.658
Your eyes are hypnotic. Chestnut? Hazel?

05:20.726 --> 05:22.660
Get a room, bartowski.
You're not asking him out

05:22.728 --> 05:23.911
On a date. You know,

05:23.996 --> 05:25.613
I think I'll just get
the cpu somewhere else.

05:25.698 --> 05:28.199
Wait, wait, wait! No, no. Uh...

05:28.267 --> 05:29.834
You-you should just take it,
you should take it.

05:29.901 --> 05:31.035
What do you mean?

05:31.086 --> 05:32.253
It's on the house,

05:32.338 --> 05:33.904
For the inconvenience
earlier with the hottie.

05:33.956 --> 05:35.873
You sure? I mean... Isn't that illegal?

05:35.924 --> 05:37.175
It's on me. My pleasure.

05:37.242 --> 05:39.910
Chuck, ease up
-- you're coming on a little strong.

05:39.962 --> 05:42.547
Here's my card, just in case you
have any other computer problems,

05:42.598 --> 05:44.432
Or if you want to chat, you know,

05:44.516 --> 05:45.550
Rap a little.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.185
Thanks.

05:47.252 --> 05:48.720
Idiot.

05:48.771 --> 05:50.388
I'm not trying to pressure you, you know.

05:50.439 --> 05:52.440
No biggie. You have my card.
If you call, you call.

05:54.643 --> 05:55.693
It's okay! Keep going!

05:55.761 --> 05:56.561
I'll hold them off!

05:56.612 --> 05:57.528
Call me!

05:57.596 --> 05:58.563
I stand corrected.

05:58.614 --> 05:59.614
He's not ready.

05:59.698 --> 06:01.866
Thank you.

Yeah, just caught up in this...

06:49.686 --> 06:51.153
Fascinating article on...

06:51.238 --> 06:52.638
Kidney failure.

06:52.689 --> 06:54.306
You've been really jittery lately.

06:54.357 --> 06:55.825
Ever since the generalissimo's party,

06:55.909 --> 06:57.993
You haven't been acting like yourself.

06:58.078 --> 07:00.746
Well... I just haven't been sleeping lately.

07:00.814 --> 07:02.581
Nothing to worry about.

07:02.649 --> 07:04.983
You don't rock climb anymore,
you never work out.

07:05.035 --> 07:07.536
You just... Lay around and watch tv all day.

07:07.621 --> 07:09.321
It's like I'm married to morgan.

07:09.389 --> 07:11.340
I pulled a hammie, I'll have you know.

07:11.424 --> 07:13.325
I'll be back on the bike in no time.

07:13.376 --> 07:14.844
Can I ask you a question

07:14.928 --> 07:15.995
About chuck?

07:16.062 --> 07:17.329
Ai!

07:17.380 --> 07:18.163
Oh!

07:18.215 --> 07:19.164
Yeah. Um,

07:19.216 --> 07:20.549
But he's your brother.

07:20.634 --> 07:23.269
I mean, can't imagine I can
tell you anything about him.

07:23.336 --> 07:24.353
Well, did you know

07:24.437 --> 07:25.805
He went to paris last week?

07:25.856 --> 07:27.807
I found this claim ticket

07:27.858 --> 07:29.508
For charles de gaulle
airport in his luggage.

07:31.111 --> 07:33.045
Yeah, yeah, uh, he mentioned it.

07:33.113 --> 07:34.396
Mentioned it?

07:34.481 --> 07:36.348
Why wouldn't he say anything to me?

07:36.416 --> 07:38.350
He's always wanted to go to paris.

07:38.418 --> 07:39.518
Did he see the eiffel tower?

07:39.569 --> 07:40.686
Yeah, he did.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.121
No, he didn't.

07:42.188 --> 07:43.289
I don't know.

07:43.356 --> 07:44.990
Damn it, I am late for my rounds.

07:45.041 --> 07:45.958
Got to run.

07:46.025 --> 07:47.209
No, devon, wait a minute.

07:47.294 --> 07:48.544
There's something you're not telling me.

07:48.628 --> 07:49.712
What's going on?

07:49.796 --> 07:52.865
Going on? What, like a conspiracy?

07:52.916 --> 07:54.032
You're freaking, babe.

07:54.084 --> 07:55.868
You are hiding something! What is it?

07:55.919 --> 07:57.670
That I love you.

07:57.721 --> 07:58.754
Which I'm not hiding.

07:58.839 --> 08:00.038
Let's talk about this later.

08:00.090 --> 08:02.508
There are kidneys failing as we speak.

08:02.559 --> 08:03.542
Devon...

08:03.593 --> 08:05.311
De...

08:09.649 --> 08:11.150
<i>What are you doing Friday?</i>

08:11.218 --> 08:13.068
You want to hang in my van?

08:13.153 --> 08:14.987
What about Thursday? And I'm disease-free.

08:15.054 --> 08:17.523
I don't think mr.
Barnes here can say the same.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.191
That was low. All's fair, kiddo.

08:19.242 --> 08:22.194
Yeah, I think that I'm pretty
booked up this week, you guys.

08:22.245 --> 08:24.446
Hannah, hannah,
could I see you for a second?

08:24.531 --> 08:27.449
Remember what I said: Me, safe;
everyone else, very, very dangerous.

08:27.534 --> 08:30.736
So, how'd you like to start phase
one of the bartowski tutorial?

08:30.787 --> 08:32.254
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.505
Yogurt time.

08:33.573 --> 08:35.073
Most important meal of the day.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.876
Uh, we'll talk later.
What about the tutorial?

08:36.927 --> 08:38.961
Lesson number one: Never work hungry.

08:40.046 --> 08:41.462
"very dangerous," huh?

08:41.548 --> 08:44.082
Morgan, buddy, hey,
can I talk to you for a second?

08:44.134 --> 08:46.101
Yeah. Would you mind
keeping an eye on hannah?

08:46.186 --> 08:47.519
The vultures are circling.

08:47.587 --> 08:48.888
Oh, boy. Sure.

08:48.939 --> 08:50.923
Lester, jeff.

08:50.974 --> 08:52.474
What, now? Can I see you both

08:52.559 --> 08:54.777
In my office, please?

08:54.861 --> 08:56.195
You have an office?

08:56.262 --> 08:58.263
There we go.

08:59.866 --> 09:01.867
What happened to all the brooms and bleach?

09:01.935 --> 09:05.204
I just, uh,  move 'em in
and out every morning.

09:05.271 --> 09:06.956
Gentlemen,

09:07.040 --> 09:08.958
Have a seat, please.

09:13.463 --> 09:16.215
Okay. It is my duty as assistant manager

09:16.283 --> 09:18.784
To tell you there'll be no
dating in the workplace.

09:18.835 --> 09:20.552
Yeah? You dated anna.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.388
It's my constitutional right to fornicate.

09:22.455 --> 09:24.256
Okay.

09:25.642 --> 09:27.259
Here's the thing.

09:27.310 --> 09:28.761
I like her.

09:28.828 --> 09:30.596
Okay? I'm just asking you guys

09:30.664 --> 09:32.481
To, you know, lay off.

09:32.565 --> 09:33.866
Fine, but I get to sleep over

09:33.934 --> 09:35.301
With you and chuck twice a week.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.987
Okay.

09:38.071 --> 09:39.271
You?

09:39.339 --> 09:40.689
Next hire...

09:40.774 --> 09:42.574
I want you to find me a wife.

09:42.642 --> 09:44.910
A woman of color,

09:44.978 --> 09:46.311
Preferably padma lakshmi.

09:46.363 --> 09:48.280
Done.

09:48.331 --> 09:49.448
One condition.

09:49.499 --> 09:51.166
You men are both excellent stalkers.

09:51.251 --> 09:53.085
I need you to use your skill
set and find out everything

09:53.152 --> 09:54.286
There is to know about hannah, okay?

09:54.337 --> 09:56.505
Likes, dislikes...

09:56.589 --> 09:58.057
Everything.

09:58.124 --> 09:59.708
Consider her stalked.

10:01.428 --> 10:03.295
Okay, credit card charges,

10:03.363 --> 10:05.097
Mostly video games, comic books.

10:05.164 --> 10:07.132
Phone records indicate only one female call

10:07.200 --> 10:08.517
In the last year-- sister.

10:08.601 --> 10:11.136
I feel so sorry for this gu
y- he seems so lonely.

10:11.187 --> 10:13.138
Oh, whoops.

10:13.189 --> 10:14.640
That's your old file, bartowski.

10:14.691 --> 10:16.642
Sorry about that.

10:16.710 --> 10:17.977
Ah, here we go.

10:18.028 --> 10:19.194
Oddly similar.

10:19.279 --> 10:21.780
<i>Battlestar galactica, dune,</i>

10:21.848 --> 10:23.983
Nacho sampler-- sounds like your dream date.

10:24.034 --> 10:26.735
The problem was, chuck,
that you came on too strong.

10:26.820 --> 10:29.204
You never want to seem like
you're making advances.

10:29.289 --> 10:31.056
You always want the other person to feel

10:31.124 --> 10:32.624
Like they're in control. Here.

10:32.692 --> 10:34.710
Thank you. So, uh, that first day

10:34.794 --> 10:37.212
You came into the buy more,
when we first met,

10:37.297 --> 10:40.132
What did they tell you about me?
What do you think?

10:40.199 --> 10:41.750
You hadn't had a date in over a year,

10:41.835 --> 10:43.419
And they don't waste the
blondes on just anyone.

10:43.503 --> 10:44.837
Uh, it hadn't been a year.

10:44.888 --> 10:45.888
Okay? Thanks.

10:45.972 --> 10:48.891
They thought you and I could connect.

10:48.975 --> 10:51.226
I remember you left me your card so I could

10:51.311 --> 10:53.045
Call you so we could go out.

10:53.096 --> 10:55.547
Felt like I was having the
luckiest day of my life.

10:55.598 --> 10:57.566
god, I was pathetic.

10:57.650 --> 11:01.053
No, you were sweet and innocent.
I liked you.

11:02.322 --> 11:05.557
It made it much harder.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.942
Why?

11:07.027 --> 11:10.029
Hey, sap's on his way to the bar. Let's go.

11:15.201 --> 11:18.754
¶ ¶

11:18.838 --> 11:23.509
<i>Wow. The last man. Incredible book.</i>

11:23.576 --> 11:26.245
The greatest literary
achievement of our generation.

11:28.098 --> 11:29.448
Hey, you're that guy

11:29.516 --> 11:30.682
From the store today.

11:32.585 --> 11:34.219
Oh, yeah.

11:34.270 --> 11:36.421
Sorry about that. We had a bet
going to see who could get

11:36.473 --> 11:38.107
A customer to steal
something from the store.

11:38.191 --> 11:39.308
I won.

11:39.392 --> 11:41.927
I knew it. Something like that had to be

11:41.978 --> 11:44.429
Going on in order for that hot
chick to want to wait on me.

11:44.481 --> 11:46.615
You don't need a 160 iq to figure that out.

11:46.699 --> 11:48.067
Boost his ego, chuck.

11:49.435 --> 11:52.204
She, uh, probably liked you.

11:52.271 --> 11:54.272
No way.

11:54.324 --> 11:55.707
The usual.

11:55.775 --> 11:58.110
We're all out of the nacho
sampler tonight, manoosh.

11:58.161 --> 12:01.296
Last one is right there.

12:01.381 --> 12:03.082
We stole all the guac from the kitchen.

12:03.133 --> 12:07.152
Remember, the nacho sampler
is his favorite dish.

12:10.156 --> 12:12.724
Go ahead. Help yourself.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.027
Thanks, um...

12:15.095 --> 12:17.129
Chuck.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.465
Can I buy you a beer, chuck?

12:21.134 --> 12:23.135
All right, here we go.
What'd you find out about hannah?

12:23.203 --> 12:27.439
Um, she is out of your league.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.975
She's a sophisticated, classy kind of broad.

12:30.026 --> 12:31.443
Yeah. She eats sushi...

12:31.494 --> 12:33.478
With chopsticks and without the rice.

12:33.530 --> 12:34.646
Wow.

12:34.714 --> 12:36.181
I copied her itunes and iphone playlists.

12:36.249 --> 12:38.951
She listens to classical music.

12:39.002 --> 12:41.420
<i>Oh, boy. Tchaikovsky's swan
lake is her most-played,</i>

12:41.487 --> 12:43.505
And she likes french cinema.

12:43.590 --> 12:46.324
And foreign films.

12:46.376 --> 12:47.325
Sorry, my friend,

12:47.377 --> 12:49.128
Even with us spying on her,

12:49.179 --> 12:50.629
You do not stand a chance.

12:52.532 --> 12:53.849
¶ ¶

12:53.933 --> 12:55.517
You're doing good. Keep it personal.

12:55.602 --> 12:57.603
Anyway, so my dad was a physicist, right,

12:57.670 --> 13:01.106
But he cracked, so when I saw
myself going down that same road,

13:01.174 --> 13:03.442
I quit, dropped out of stanford.

13:03.509 --> 13:04.726
That's exactly what happened to me,

13:04.811 --> 13:06.945
Except I dropped out of mit.

13:07.013 --> 13:09.198
Huh. I knew I could tell
a fellow underachieving,

13:09.282 --> 13:11.016
Underappreciated man of intellect.

13:11.067 --> 13:13.852
Great, two geeks in a pod.

13:13.903 --> 13:17.539
What are you suggesting?
That buy more is not an

13:17.624 --> 13:18.707
Impressive enough career choice?

13:18.791 --> 13:20.525
It's okay.

13:20.577 --> 13:22.828
All the doubters will be sorry soon enough.

13:22.879 --> 13:25.464
They don't understand guys like us.

13:25.531 --> 13:27.466
I got something big planned.

13:27.533 --> 13:29.885
This is it. Move in.

13:29.969 --> 13:31.703
Gently, chuck. Don't push him.

13:31.754 --> 13:33.138
Uh, how, how so?

13:33.206 --> 13:34.973
What are you, uh, what are you working on?

13:36.142 --> 13:38.810
Work-- won't leave me alone.

13:38.878 --> 13:40.846
Hello.

13:40.897 --> 13:43.315
Guys, he's got a ring phone.

13:43.383 --> 13:44.650
I'll run a trace.

13:45.718 --> 13:46.902
Whoa, slow down, chief.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.570
Yes, I have the prototype.

13:48.655 --> 13:51.073
Still have some kinks to work out.

13:51.157 --> 13:54.576
Look, I gotta go. I'm with a friend.

13:54.661 --> 13:55.994
Sorry about that.

13:56.062 --> 13:57.729
These guys, they're a little high-strung.

13:57.780 --> 13:58.730
Yeah.

13:58.781 --> 14:00.165
Act all tough, you know?

14:00.233 --> 14:02.668
Think they're intimidating
with their secret phones.

14:02.735 --> 14:04.536
Ooh... Scary.

14:07.423 --> 14:09.258
Signal just bounced back three miles away.

14:09.342 --> 14:10.909
Ring's tracking him. We got about five

14:10.960 --> 14:12.294
Minutes before they get here, tops.

14:12.378 --> 14:14.513
Time to send in a pro. You're up, walker.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.681
So, you were talking

14:15.748 --> 14:16.748
About your job?

14:16.799 --> 14:18.917
I'm doing something weapons-related.

14:18.968 --> 14:22.354
But that's really all I can say.

14:22.421 --> 14:24.973
I want to tell you, believe me, I do.

14:26.926 --> 14:30.262
¶ ¶

14:36.669 --> 14:38.436
What the hell is she doing in here?

14:38.488 --> 14:39.771
I got this!

14:39.822 --> 14:42.291
You weren't moving fast enough.
Had to send in a closer.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.625
The ring will be here any minute.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.712
That hot chick just smiled at me.

14:46.779 --> 14:48.280
Oh, my gosh, she's coming
over here. What do I do?

14:48.331 --> 14:50.415
Just, just play it cool.
Let her come to you.

14:50.466 --> 14:51.750
Is this what cool people do?

14:51.801 --> 14:55.637
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, you know,
kinda... Put out the vibe.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.556
Make a move, walker. We're wasting time.

14:57.623 --> 15:00.642
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

15:00.727 --> 15:01.977
Help him out, chuck.

15:02.061 --> 15:02.978
Uh..

15:03.062 --> 15:04.229
No, it's not. It's not taken.

15:04.297 --> 15:06.982
He was actually saving
it for you, I believe.

15:07.066 --> 15:08.984
Thank you.

15:09.068 --> 15:10.986
Sarah.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.104
Manoosh.

15:14.974 --> 15:16.241
The ring's here.

15:16.309 --> 15:18.193
Get him out back now!

15:18.278 --> 15:20.162
Manoosh, come here.

15:20.246 --> 15:21.079
Where?

15:21.147 --> 15:22.998
Closer.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.501
You got something on your lip.

15:26.586 --> 15:27.953
Let me take it off.

15:38.831 --> 15:40.498
You get him. I'm gonna get the briefcase.

15:40.550 --> 15:41.666
They're heading in! Hurry up!

15:41.718 --> 15:43.335
I want him alive.

15:43.386 --> 15:44.336
Looks like our friend

15:44.387 --> 15:46.605
Manoosh here had one too many.

15:56.199 --> 16:00.152
Wow, this is the best night of my life.

16:00.203 --> 16:01.620
Nice job, walker.

16:01.687 --> 16:03.372
Another geek bites the dust.

16:21.599 --> 16:23.266
Wake up, baby.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.268
Hi.

16:28.072 --> 16:29.038
Where am I?

16:29.106 --> 16:30.490
My bedroom. What, you don't remember?

16:30.574 --> 16:34.711
Guess you had one too many drinks, loverboy.

16:34.778 --> 16:37.080
Did we... You know?

16:37.131 --> 16:39.115
Yes, and it was amazing.

16:39.166 --> 16:43.803
Oh! It was so intense,
we both just passed out.

16:43.888 --> 16:45.388
I've never even spoken to a woman

16:45.455 --> 16:47.423
As beautiful as you before.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.791
Why'd you choose me?

16:48.842 --> 16:51.561
Because there's something
just so mysterious about you

16:51.628 --> 16:53.062
And sexy.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.648
And you were telling me
about your top secret work,

16:55.733 --> 16:58.268
And secrets turn me on...

16:58.335 --> 16:59.852
It's a weapon!

16:59.937 --> 17:01.604
A new technology that'll change everything.

17:01.655 --> 17:02.605
Tell me more.

17:02.656 --> 17:03.940
Okay, but first,

17:03.991 --> 17:07.160
I don't really remember
much from last night.

17:07.243 --> 17:10.146
Can we do it again so I'll never forget?

17:27.830 --> 17:29.265
Guys, this isn't working.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.683
Is he gonna be okay?

17:30.768 --> 17:31.801
'cause that's, like, the fifth

17:31.852 --> 17:32.885
Tranq dart that he's taken.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.304
How many can a normal person handle?

17:34.355 --> 17:36.306
As many as it takes for him to tell us

17:36.357 --> 17:38.308
What he's building for the ring.
They're "twilight" tranqs, chuck.

17:38.359 --> 17:39.442
They don't do permanent damage.

17:39.509 --> 17:41.177
They just make you forget what happened

17:41.228 --> 17:42.545
In the last five minutes.

17:42.613 --> 17:43.780
Well, he's my asset.

17:43.847 --> 17:44.847
I should've handled this.

17:50.704 --> 17:52.488
Looks like he's ready for round six...

17:52.539 --> 17:55.458
Whoa-whoa, take it easy, tranqenstein.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.551
Hello.

18:05.636 --> 18:07.253
Chuck, it's manoosh.

18:07.338 --> 18:09.339
Hey, manizzle. How you doing, buddy?

18:09.390 --> 18:10.390
How was last night?

18:10.474 --> 18:11.841
I can't really remember, but judging

18:11.909 --> 18:13.243
By the fact that I'm hal
f-naked in her bedroom right now,

18:13.811 --> 18:15.212
I've gotta say you are singlehandedly

18:15.279 --> 18:16.596
The best wingman in the world!

18:16.681 --> 18:18.431
Well, thanks, buddy. What can I say?

18:18.516 --> 18:20.100
I do have my skill sets.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.985
Listen, um, you didn't happen
to come across a briefcase

18:22.052 --> 18:23.220
At the mexican restaurant, did you?

18:23.287 --> 18:24.654
My entire life's work's in there.

18:24.722 --> 18:25.655
Kinda freaking out.

18:25.723 --> 18:26.857
No, no, no, no,

18:26.908 --> 18:29.392
Your wingman saw that
you left said briefcase

18:29.443 --> 18:31.077
And picked it up for you.

18:31.162 --> 18:33.229
Oh, thank you, chuck.
Look, I've got a flight to catch.

18:33.281 --> 18:35.282
Do you think you can meet me at the buy more

18:35.366 --> 18:36.399
In about a half an hour?

18:36.467 --> 18:37.918
Half hour? Not a problem.

18:38.002 --> 18:40.170
Great. Thanks.

18:41.672 --> 18:42.622
Sarah...

18:43.925 --> 18:44.875
You in there?

18:48.379 --> 18:49.296
Oh...

18:53.083 --> 18:54.050
No, no, no!

18:54.101 --> 18:55.418
Langley said don't open it.

18:55.469 --> 18:56.720
They're sending their own hazmat team.

18:56.771 --> 18:58.104
But we don't have time to wait, casey.

18:58.189 --> 18:59.773
Get your hand off of that.

18:59.857 --> 19:05.762
Hmm, comic book, glasses, shirt...

19:05.830 --> 19:06.780
Bingo.

19:12.537 --> 19:13.770
Guys, I'm not flashing.

19:13.821 --> 19:16.289
Whatever it is, it's not in the intersect.

19:16.374 --> 19:17.908
Oh!

19:17.959 --> 19:18.942
Easy, bartowski.

19:18.993 --> 19:20.493
We don't know what this is.

19:20.578 --> 19:22.045
You think it could be a bomb?

19:22.112 --> 19:23.279
I don't know.

19:23.331 --> 19:26.115
But we're not gonna find out the hard way.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.618
Okay, just meet manoosh at
the buy more, and give him

19:28.669 --> 19:31.154
Back the briefcase,
and act like nothing happened.

19:31.222 --> 19:33.723
Wait. What? Don't we need to replace
it or something before we do that?

19:33.791 --> 19:36.009
I mean, imagine what the
ring is gonna do to him

19:36.093 --> 19:37.844
If they find out he doesn't have it!

19:37.929 --> 19:39.462
Just don't think about it, chuck.

19:39.530 --> 19:42.465
It makes being a spy a lot easier.

19:50.641 --> 19:53.660
Dude, dude, I am freaking out.

19:53.744 --> 19:54.978
What? Come here. Come here.

19:55.029 --> 19:57.480
Ellie found a baggage ticket
from your paris mission.

19:57.531 --> 20:00.667
I didn't know what to say,
so I told her you were on a work trip.

20:00.751 --> 20:04.170
I can't do this anymore. I cannot lie to
my wife. I have to tell her the truth.

20:04.255 --> 20:06.456
Look, you need to calm down, okay?

20:06.507 --> 20:07.707
You cannot tell her

20:07.792 --> 20:08.892
Anything.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.493
I don't think you realize the gravity

20:10.544 --> 20:12.829
Of the situation that you are in,

20:12.880 --> 20:13.863
But you know my secret,

20:13.931 --> 20:15.498
And there are strings attached to that.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.566
What strings?

20:16.634 --> 20:17.884
If ellie finds out,

20:17.969 --> 20:19.302
Your lives are never gonna be the same.

20:19.370 --> 20:20.503
They're gonna stick you
both in witness protection,

20:20.571 --> 20:23.189
And I don't think that you want that.

20:23.274 --> 20:24.441
Look, buddy, I understand that the lying

20:24.508 --> 20:26.409
Is very difficult at this point right now,

20:26.477 --> 20:29.729
But trust me, it gets easier.

20:31.699 --> 20:33.366
Get down! Get down!

20:37.354 --> 20:38.354
Hey, hey, ellie.

20:38.406 --> 20:39.522
Hi. Um...

20:39.573 --> 20:40.523
What's going on?

20:40.574 --> 20:42.025
Chuck, look, I know that we're older,

20:42.076 --> 20:44.077
And we don't have to tell each other

20:44.161 --> 20:47.497
Everything, but I found out about paris.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.716
And I just... I don't know.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.836
When did we start keeping
secrets from each other?

20:52.887 --> 20:55.805
Well, the thing is I was,
I was gonna tell you.

20:55.873 --> 20:57.090
Um, it was a business trip.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.576
This very eccentric customer
came into the buy more

20:59.644 --> 21:01.394
And insisted that I do
a home theatre install

21:01.479 --> 21:03.263
In his flat in paris.

21:03.347 --> 21:04.781
So why keep that from me?

21:04.849 --> 21:06.883
Well, because I did such a good job,

21:06.934 --> 21:10.186
He said I could use his
flat for free for a week.

21:10.237 --> 21:12.355
And I figured, well, you know,

21:12.406 --> 21:14.240
Maybe you and devon could
use a proper honeymoon.

21:14.325 --> 21:16.526
And I wanted it to be a surprise.

21:16.594 --> 21:17.577
Are you serious?

21:17.662 --> 21:19.062
Yeah. Chuck, that is

21:19.113 --> 21:20.563
The sweetest thing!

21:20.614 --> 21:22.365
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:22.433 --> 21:24.901
I'm sorry that I thought you
were keeping secrets from me.

21:24.969 --> 21:27.787
Told ya he's ready. Kid's a good liar.

21:27.872 --> 21:30.123
You taught him well, walker.

21:30.207 --> 21:34.210
Please, ellie, brother-sister,
there are no secrets between us.

21:34.278 --> 21:35.545
Thank you. Bye.

21:37.682 --> 21:39.683
Bro, that was so cold-blooded.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.918
How could you just lie to her like that?

21:41.986 --> 21:44.554
Ellie and I aren't kids anymore, all right?

21:46.090 --> 21:47.857
There are some things she's
better off not knowing.

21:50.311 --> 21:51.945
Manizzle.

21:53.447 --> 21:55.398
Thanks, chuck.

21:55.449 --> 21:56.866
You are a lifesaver.

21:56.934 --> 21:58.401
Hey, what are friends for, right?

21:58.452 --> 21:59.936
We are friends, aren't we?

21:59.987 --> 22:03.573
Well, when I get back from this trip,
I am going to be rich.

22:03.641 --> 22:05.441
And then I'll start a company of my own,

22:05.493 --> 22:07.610
And then we can work together.

22:07.661 --> 22:11.081
Don't worry, I won't forget you.

22:11.132 --> 22:12.966
Hello. No, I told you,

22:13.050 --> 22:15.251
I'm still working the kinks out.

22:15.302 --> 22:16.920
Calm down.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.788
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.591
Who was that?

22:21.642 --> 22:23.510
The putzes who hired me.
You know, I found out they're

22:23.594 --> 22:25.311
Paying me peanuts compared
to what I can get on

22:25.396 --> 22:26.980
The open market. But I'm no fool.

22:27.064 --> 22:28.598
Anyway...

22:28.649 --> 22:29.966
Thanks, buddy.

22:30.017 --> 22:31.901
Wait, wait, wait.

22:31.969 --> 22:33.737
Um, uh...

22:33.804 --> 22:36.139
Before you go, let me get you some yogurt.

22:36.190 --> 22:38.858
Because, you know, you can't
travel on an empty stomach.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.476
So stay here. I'll be right back.

22:40.528 --> 22:41.978
Okay, all right.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.949
Not picking up any sign of ordnance.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.250
Definitely not a bomb.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.319
Guys, guys, we need to help manoosh, okay?

22:50.371 --> 22:52.505
The ring's gonna track him down,
and if he doesn't

22:52.590 --> 22:54.591
Give that thing back to them,
they're gonna hurt him or worse.

22:54.658 --> 22:55.625
Cry me a river.

22:55.676 --> 22:57.260
He's building a weapon.

22:57.327 --> 22:58.327
He's no innocent.

23:02.016 --> 23:03.349
He's served his purpose.
That's what an asset is.

23:03.434 --> 23:06.503
Conduit to information, nothing more.

23:11.842 --> 23:14.177
No more ducking us, manoosh.

23:14.245 --> 23:15.528
Take us to your lab.

23:15.613 --> 23:17.147
We want our weapon.

23:17.198 --> 23:18.148
Wait, wait, wait.

23:18.215 --> 23:20.349
Found something.

23:24.855 --> 23:26.389
What is that?

23:26.457 --> 23:27.874
Anthrax? Agent orange?

23:27.958 --> 23:28.875
Okay, guys, fine.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.543
Just, uh...

23:30.628 --> 23:32.745
Just let me put my shades on real quick.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.164
It's really bright out.

23:34.215 --> 23:37.333
U.V. Protection-- very important these days.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.889
Shaving cream.

23:42.973 --> 23:44.140
It was a decoy.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.642
Then where is the weapon?

23:45.709 --> 23:47.310
They found manoosh.

23:47.377 --> 23:49.846
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
They're gonna kill him.

24:33.941 --> 24:35.942
That's not the weapon.

24:36.026 --> 24:38.945
Manoosh is the weapon.

24:41.532 --> 24:43.116
He built a new intersect.

24:53.157 --> 24:55.125
how did manoosh build an intersect?

24:55.176 --> 24:58.328
I thought my dad was the only
one who knew how to do that.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.597
Well, after 2.0 intersect was destroyed,

25:00.648 --> 25:01.932
The ring lifted certain burnt components

25:01.999 --> 25:03.817
From a cia warehouse.

25:03.901 --> 25:05.152
Manoosh must have reverse engineered it.

25:05.236 --> 25:07.070
We need to find manoosh
before the ring does.

25:07.138 --> 25:08.471
He mentioned getting rich.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.157
That he was going to sell
it to the highest bidder.

25:10.241 --> 25:12.075
I got something.

25:12.143 --> 25:16.279
Manoosh just used his credit
card to book a flight to dubai.

25:16.330 --> 25:17.497
Why? What's in dubai?

25:17.582 --> 25:19.699
Weap-con.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.518
The greatest weapons
convention in the world.

25:21.586 --> 25:24.704
I go every year.
I find it incredibly relaxing.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.025
looks like I'll get to write this year's off

25:29.093 --> 25:30.327
As a business trip.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.019
Come in.

25:39.103 --> 25:40.904
Hey, morgan.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.557
Uh, jeff said you wanted to see me?

25:43.641 --> 25:46.176
I did, I did, yeah. Nothing urgent.
I just wanted to see

25:46.244 --> 25:48.178
How the buy more's treating you.

25:48.229 --> 25:50.147
"swan lake."

25:50.214 --> 25:51.531
It's my favorite.

25:51.616 --> 25:53.116
Mine, too.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.018
<i>Sans respirer's a classic.</i>

25:55.086 --> 25:57.020
I must have seen it like ten times.

25:57.088 --> 26:00.490
12. Yeah, I can't get
enough of french new wave.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.491
Huh.

26:01.559 --> 26:02.692
Oh, have a seat, have s seat.

26:02.743 --> 26:05.295
It's amazing how much we have in common.

26:05.362 --> 26:06.713
Right? Yeah.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.732
I just-- I love international cinema.

26:08.799 --> 26:12.219
It's not just the cinema,
it's the people and the culture.

26:12.303 --> 26:13.470
Right? Uh, boy...

26:13.537 --> 26:15.205
Sadly, too many of my
colleagues think that burbank

26:15.256 --> 26:16.723
Is the center of the world.

26:16.807 --> 26:18.475
Yeah, chuck had never been to paris

26:18.542 --> 26:20.227
Until last week on that install.

26:20.311 --> 26:22.445
Chuck went to paris?

26:24.765 --> 26:28.318
Oh, uh, right, I forgot,
chuck told me to keep it quiet.

26:28.385 --> 26:29.719
Everything's a little secret around here.

26:29.770 --> 26:31.071
But of course, you know,

26:31.155 --> 26:33.690
As you are the assistant manager.

26:33.741 --> 26:35.558
Right, I am, of course, sure.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.227
I know everything about chuck.

26:37.278 --> 26:40.197
Well, do you mind telling me what goes on

26:40.248 --> 26:41.615
Over at that yogurt store?

26:41.699 --> 26:44.701
Because, um, um...

26:44.752 --> 26:46.836
He is...

26:46.904 --> 26:49.623
Okay, constantly running over there.

26:49.707 --> 26:51.291
Yogurt store?

26:51.375 --> 26:52.943
Yes. Uh, his ex works there.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.745
He's having trouble letting go.

26:55.796 --> 26:57.547
Um, morgan, hey, uh...

26:57.598 --> 27:00.467
What was it that you
wanted to talk to me about?

27:00.551 --> 27:01.801
Nothing.

27:07.725 --> 27:10.193
Paris.

27:10.261 --> 27:12.128
<i>Where else has he gone?</i>

27:18.369 --> 27:20.070
Welcome to weap-con.

27:20.121 --> 27:23.790
<i>Bienvenidos, bonjour,
as-salaam alaikum.</i>

27:28.496 --> 27:32.082
Ammo can be found in the west pavilion.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.167
Explosive and short-range missiles are...

27:40.457 --> 27:42.809
Deadly pens. I've got
exploding pens, laser pens...

27:42.893 --> 27:46.296
Hey! Casey, no shopping.
We're here to find manoosh.

27:46.347 --> 27:48.181
You sir, what kind of pen do you want?

27:48.266 --> 27:49.816
How much for the laser pen?

27:49.900 --> 27:51.234
Behold this beauty.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.303
The em-50 mobile interrogation unit.

27:53.354 --> 27:56.156
The most exclusive one of its kind,

27:56.240 --> 27:58.775
The em-50 is nearly
impossible to escape from.

27:58.826 --> 28:00.610
You don't have time to
get a prisoner to gitmo,

28:00.661 --> 28:02.279
But you need to extract vital information,

28:02.330 --> 28:04.281
This is your unit.

28:04.332 --> 28:07.584
The presentation on stage
four is about to begin.

28:07.651 --> 28:09.002
Ladies...

28:09.086 --> 28:10.954
Please, have a seat, get situated.

28:11.005 --> 28:12.122
Huh?

28:12.173 --> 28:13.656
Ladies, gentlemen,

28:13.708 --> 28:15.658
Warlords, sheiks and huns.

28:15.710 --> 28:17.327
I see some huns back there, don't I?

28:17.378 --> 28:20.496
Welcome to the future
of warfare and weapons.

28:20.548 --> 28:22.349
I have before me

28:22.433 --> 28:25.051
The most powerful weapon known to mankind.

28:27.104 --> 28:30.023
That weapon, you ask...

28:30.107 --> 28:31.308
Is me!

28:33.510 --> 28:36.146
At this time yesterday,
I was a pathetic weakling.

28:36.197 --> 28:38.365
These bikini babes wouldn't even spit on me.

28:38.449 --> 28:41.651
I have no muscle, terrible allergies

28:41.702 --> 28:43.286
And am completely uncoordinated,

28:43.354 --> 28:45.155
But...

28:45.206 --> 28:47.240
Behold me now.

28:53.964 --> 28:56.166
Moments ago, I was a 100-pound weakling.

28:57.868 --> 28:59.302
Now a deadly kung fu expert.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.806
Laugh if you will.

29:02.873 --> 29:05.041
Do I have any volunteers?

29:05.092 --> 29:06.643
Maybe one of you apes thinks

29:06.710 --> 29:07.977
They can kick my ass.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.182
Step back, ladies.

29:31.419 --> 29:34.254
Thank you, thank you.

29:34.338 --> 29:36.239
Imagine an entire army of men like me.

29:36.290 --> 29:37.540
No training involved.

29:37.591 --> 29:41.244
Just throw these glasses
on any civilian and voila,

29:41.295 --> 29:42.679
An army of instant warriors.

29:42.746 --> 29:44.580
So call your banks, your kings,

29:44.632 --> 29:46.132
Your dignitaries or what have you,

29:46.217 --> 29:48.084
'cause we're going to start
the bidding in five minutes.

29:48.135 --> 29:49.686
And we're gonna kick this bad boy off

29:49.753 --> 29:50.937
At $50 million.

29:51.021 --> 29:52.689
Thank you!

30:05.269 --> 30:06.486
Ooh, nachos.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.291
He's my asset. I'll handle this.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.076
Don't get soft on him, bartowski.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.611
The only way any of us are safe

30:14.678 --> 30:16.746
Is if he's under lock and key.

30:16.797 --> 30:19.449
Well, fine. I can control him.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.484
Then do it.

30:27.975 --> 30:30.460
Chuck? What are you doing here?

30:32.296 --> 30:35.632
I came to protect you, okay?

30:35.699 --> 30:37.901
To stop you from making
a very horrible mistake.

30:37.968 --> 30:39.602
I know about the glasses.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.471
I know about the new intersect
that you're building.

30:41.522 --> 30:43.072
Who are you?

30:43.140 --> 30:46.109
I'm an agent with the cia.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.811
So you were tracking me?

30:48.863 --> 30:51.681
This friendship is fake?

30:52.649 --> 30:53.867
Sarah?

30:53.951 --> 30:55.168
That wasn't real either?

30:55.252 --> 30:57.086
I'm sorry, okay?

30:57.154 --> 30:58.171
I really am sorry.

30:58.255 --> 30:59.622
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings here.

30:59.690 --> 31:03.176
I just... I can't let you do this.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.827
These are bad people you're selling to.

31:04.879 --> 31:07.514
Worse than a guy who pretends
to be my only friend?

31:07.598 --> 31:08.681
Or a woman who pretends

31:08.766 --> 31:10.300
To have intercourse with me?

31:11.719 --> 31:14.137
The truth is, I don't need friends, chuck.

31:14.188 --> 31:16.473
Not when I've got these.

31:17.341 --> 31:18.525
Manoosh!

31:23.347 --> 31:25.398
Hello, manoosh.

31:26.484 --> 31:27.984
We've been looking for you.

31:28.035 --> 31:31.154
I believe you have something of ours.

31:52.567 --> 31:55.569
Wow. So now not only does
the ring have both manoosh,

31:55.753 --> 31:57.621
But also the new intersect
that he's building.

31:57.672 --> 31:58.972
That is just super.

31:59.057 --> 32:00.674
Good thing I bought that laser pen

32:00.758 --> 32:01.758
From the japanese booth.

32:01.809 --> 32:04.127
It burns through anything.

32:04.179 --> 32:06.847
I thought sarah specifically
said no shopping.

32:06.931 --> 32:08.815
Just scootch over here,
grab it with your mouth.

32:08.900 --> 32:10.300
Come on. Get your mouth over here

32:10.351 --> 32:12.769
And pull it out of my
inside pocket. Let's go.

32:14.005 --> 32:15.105
Come on.

32:15.173 --> 32:16.806
There we go.

32:16.858 --> 32:18.575
Oh!

32:18.643 --> 32:19.809
Shh! Quiet!

32:21.329 --> 32:22.746
Right here. Okay. On the left.

32:22.814 --> 32:24.281
Easy. Okay, okay, okay.

32:24.349 --> 32:26.333
Come on. Shh!

32:27.585 --> 32:28.518
What do we--

32:28.586 --> 32:30.420
Don't be shy. Just get in there.

32:32.624 --> 32:34.041
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.158
Okay, ow, ow.

32:35.210 --> 32:36.710
Easy!

32:36.794 --> 32:37.994
Don't bite me!

32:38.046 --> 32:38.995
I'm not biting you.

32:39.047 --> 32:40.163
All right. You got it?

32:40.215 --> 32:42.165
Uh-huh. Just be careful of the button.

32:42.217 --> 32:43.467
It activates the laser.

32:43.518 --> 32:44.968
whoa!

32:49.691 --> 32:51.608
You aim carefully now, bartowski.

32:51.676 --> 32:53.560
Don't you make me a eunuch.

32:53.645 --> 32:57.948
Otherwise, I'll teach you the
meaning of "eye for an eye."

32:58.015 --> 32:59.199
Get to work.

33:03.121 --> 33:04.371
Easy.

33:04.455 --> 33:05.822
I got it!

33:05.873 --> 33:08.525
Shh. Give me that.

33:10.962 --> 33:12.996
All right. Here we go.

33:13.047 --> 33:14.998
Here... Lasers.

33:19.387 --> 33:22.472
Woman : Ammo can be found
in the west pavilion.

33:22.540 --> 33:23.724
Explosives and short-range missiles...

33:23.808 --> 33:26.393
Look, guys, I'll cut you a deal, huh?

33:26.477 --> 33:27.594
Half off.

33:27.679 --> 33:29.313
No, you'll give it to us.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.347
We don't need you anymore.

33:30.398 --> 33:32.048
Yeah?

33:34.102 --> 33:35.552
Looks like you need me now.

33:35.603 --> 33:37.437
So let's talk about a reasonable fee, okay?

33:38.990 --> 33:40.890
Drop your guns!

33:43.244 --> 33:44.995
Hey, folks, it sounds like we have

33:45.062 --> 33:48.582
Another demonstration
taking place back here.

33:48.666 --> 33:51.668
As you can see, many of our
products are ideally suited

33:51.736 --> 33:54.070
For resolving these types
of hostage negotiations.

33:55.239 --> 33:56.840
Impressive simulation.

33:56.907 --> 33:58.925
Yeah, well, I'd rather kill him, too,

33:59.010 --> 34:00.761
Than let you have him, so I guess

34:00.845 --> 34:03.430
We're on the same page.
Looks like manoosh dies, then.

34:03.514 --> 34:05.549
Manoosh is not going to die.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.601
In my hand, I hold a japanese laser pen.

34:08.686 --> 34:10.687
Pinpoint accuracy.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.389
Could shoot the wings off a fly,

34:12.456 --> 34:14.775
If one was so sadistically
inclined, which I am!

34:14.859 --> 34:16.860
Nobody drop their guns!

34:16.927 --> 34:21.398
He won't do it. I can see it
in his eyes. He won't kill me.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.202
Okay, fine. That's fair.
I probably won't kill you.

34:25.268 --> 34:28.271
But I will remove the greater
part of your earlobe.

34:30.658 --> 34:32.125
What the...?!

34:32.210 --> 34:33.443
Casey, what is the de...?!

34:33.494 --> 34:35.245
I specifically asked for
the same pen that you got.

34:35.295 --> 34:36.413
She gave me the wrong pen.

34:36.481 --> 34:37.614
Just like bartowski,

34:37.665 --> 34:39.081
Bring a knife to a gun fight.

34:39.150 --> 34:40.217
Now, where were we?

34:40.284 --> 34:43.754
Oh, I know. We were going to kill you.

35:01.689 --> 35:02.989
He's getting away.

35:20.925 --> 35:23.493
You secure manoosh.
He cannot walk out of here

35:23.544 --> 35:24.795
Knowing what he knows.

35:27.048 --> 35:29.850
Wow, chuck. That was awesome.

35:29.934 --> 35:32.352
Incredible, just incredible!

35:32.437 --> 35:35.055
Well, thanks for rescuing me.
I mean, if it weren't for you,

35:35.139 --> 35:37.107
I'd probably be in some deep,
dark cell somewhere.

35:37.174 --> 35:39.643
Uh...

35:39.694 --> 35:41.445
Speaking of which, manoosh,

35:41.512 --> 35:42.879
I cannot let you go.

35:42.947 --> 35:44.698
Chuck, please.

35:44.782 --> 35:46.450
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

35:46.517 --> 35:48.535
No one will ever know about the intersect

35:48.619 --> 35:50.036
Me, the sunglasses, anything.

35:50.121 --> 35:51.571
I'll disappear. I swear.

35:57.862 --> 35:59.229
Thanks, chuck.

35:59.297 --> 36:01.581
I owe you my life.

36:08.890 --> 36:11.308
Tour guide: Here at the
tranq gun booth, we feature

36:11.375 --> 36:13.042
The latest in non-lethal suppression.

36:13.094 --> 36:15.679
That's 50 ccs of pure-grade ether.

36:15.730 --> 36:18.348
Your enemies will get plenty of rest

36:18.399 --> 36:20.100
Before you interrogate them.

36:22.153 --> 36:24.354
I guess bartowski doesn't have the stones.

36:31.729 --> 36:33.997
Another fabulous demonstration.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.583
I stand corrected.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.603
He has to go underground.

36:46.655 --> 36:47.905
If the ring finds him,

36:47.972 --> 36:49.573
Then he can build them another intersect.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.442
It's the only way.

36:51.493 --> 36:53.143
Do you want me to handle it?

36:53.194 --> 36:54.978
Yeah.

36:55.030 --> 36:56.864
Yeah, I would. Um...

36:56.948 --> 36:59.049
But I have to do it.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.669
Hey.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.587
Hey.

37:03.654 --> 37:05.339
I've been scared to death.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.657
So, when are you guys going to release me?

37:07.709 --> 37:08.842
I just want to go home,

37:08.927 --> 37:10.494
Forget this ever happened.

37:10.545 --> 37:14.014
You can't go home, manoosh.
We are sending you

37:14.099 --> 37:15.165
To a secured isolation facility.

37:15.216 --> 37:17.017
Somewhere that you will be safe.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.502
But I didn't do anything wrong!

37:18.553 --> 37:22.306
I mean, I tried to make a few bucks,
but that's not illegal!

37:25.193 --> 37:27.528
Chuck. You have to help me!

37:28.713 --> 37:30.680
I thought you were my friend.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.785
I'm not.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.203
I'm a spy.

37:39.374 --> 37:40.657
Chuck.

37:40.709 --> 37:43.377
Chuck! Please.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.412
Chuck!

37:45.497 --> 37:48.698
Hmm. Only one way to deal
with burning an asset.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.334
Johnny walker.

37:50.385 --> 37:52.086
Black.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.147
Hey.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.015
Where you been, another trip to paris?

38:05.066 --> 38:06.884
Uh, dubai, actually.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.185
Funny.

38:08.253 --> 38:12.322
Or-or maybe you were at
that yogurt store again?

38:12.390 --> 38:14.742
I know your ex works there.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.028
Uh, hey, what about the tutorial?

38:18.079 --> 38:19.396
Rule number one:

38:19.464 --> 38:21.165
Never work on an empty stomach.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.732
On break. Going to quickie sushi.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.419
Hey. There he is.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.420
Hey.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.454
Can we talk for a second?

38:27.539 --> 38:29.072
Uh, yeah, I'm kind of beat, morgan.

38:29.124 --> 38:31.408
Oh, yeah. I can imagine. All that travel.

38:31.459 --> 38:34.678
What, uh... What traveling?

38:34.745 --> 38:36.880
Just driving around town
on all those installs.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.248
Right, yeah.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.416
It's got to be exhausting.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.971
Hey, anything you want to talk to me about?

38:46.757 --> 38:49.276
No. Is there anything you want to ask me?

38:49.360 --> 38:51.261
No.

38:51.312 --> 38:53.197
Okay, great. Good talk.

38:53.264 --> 38:54.264
Absolutely. One of our best.

38:55.450 --> 38:58.068
Yo.

38:58.119 --> 38:59.787
How'd it go last night, stallion?

39:01.239 --> 39:03.040
You take her to pound town?

39:03.107 --> 39:05.242
Ooh, can I get an address on that?

39:05.293 --> 39:07.628
Actually, I need a little more
research done here, fellas.

39:07.712 --> 39:08.996
Hmm.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.631
I told you, we still need to study

39:10.715 --> 39:12.616
Her sleeping patterns.

39:12.667 --> 39:15.085
Oh, no. Not-not research on hannah.

39:15.136 --> 39:17.137
Research on chuck.

39:19.457 --> 39:22.476
¶ ¶

39:22.560 --> 39:23.894
Finally.

39:23.961 --> 39:27.064
Honey, the tickets that chuck
got us to paris are here.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.132
First class!

39:31.802 --> 39:33.136
I don't think we should go.

39:33.188 --> 39:35.639
What? They're free tickets.

39:35.690 --> 39:37.324
No, they're not.

39:37.408 --> 39:39.610
Nothing is free.

39:39.661 --> 39:41.778
Those have strings attached.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.580
What strings? They're from chuck.

39:43.648 --> 39:44.781
What are you talking about?

39:44.849 --> 39:46.166
He...

39:47.485 --> 39:49.536
You...

39:50.538 --> 39:52.339
You have to obey me.

39:53.675 --> 39:54.958
Yeah, I think that was in our vows.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.711
I am the husband,
and I forbid us to go to paris.

39:58.546 --> 40:00.681
That's it!

40:03.334 --> 40:04.968
Oh, hey, morgan.

40:05.019 --> 40:07.354
You forbid us?! Are you kidding me, devon?

40:07.438 --> 40:09.523
Ellie, hey. Is everything okay?

40:09.607 --> 40:11.341
No, I think that there's
something weird going on

40:11.392 --> 40:12.359
With chuck and devon.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.777
It's like they're... I don't know.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.229
They're keeping this secret from me.

40:17.315 --> 40:18.682
Um...

40:18.733 --> 40:20.067
Okay.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.369
Are you suggesting chuck is
caught in a big, giant web

40:22.453 --> 40:24.154
Of conspiracy and-and deception?

40:25.406 --> 40:27.541
I know. I know when you put it like that,

40:27.625 --> 40:28.692
It sounds ridiculous.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.694
Because I couldn't agree more!

40:30.745 --> 40:32.863
All right, I've been thinking
about this for months.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.082
Finally, someone with some common sense.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.935
Morgan, we have to figure
out what's going on.

40:38.002 --> 40:41.054
Don't worry about it.
I got my best men on it.

40:42.724 --> 40:44.808
¶ ¶

41:07.165 --> 41:09.283
¶ ¶

41:16.641 --> 41:20.077
Our boy's growing up, huh?

41:20.144 --> 41:21.411
When we first met him,

41:21.462 --> 41:23.847
You ever think he'd be
able to burn an asset?

41:23.914 --> 41:26.082
No.

41:26.134 --> 41:28.769
Well, he's turning into a spy.

41:28.853 --> 41:30.854
That's a good thing.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.859
Is it?

41:39.647 --> 41:41.732
So you think this kid's got the intersect?

41:41.783 --> 41:42.899
That's right, agent walker.

41:42.951 --> 41:44.701
He's connected to bryce larkin.

41:44.769 --> 41:45.736
Weaknesses?

41:45.787 --> 41:47.120
Bright, but an underachiever.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.489
Lonely. Had his heart broken recently.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.959
I'm downloading his picture now.

42:00.818 --> 42:03.136
Piece of cake.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.222
¶ who's that? Vicki vale,
vicki vale, vic-vicki vale. ¶
