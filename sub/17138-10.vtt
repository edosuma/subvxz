WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:05.335
My name is Damien Darhk.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.064
In 2016, I was murdered
by the Green Arrow.

00:09.066 --> 00:12.303
But I was removed from the
timeline 31 years before

00:12.328 --> 00:16.177
my death by a speedster from
the future named Eobard Thawne.

00:16.202 --> 00:17.868
Together, with Malcolm Merlyn,

00:17.893 --> 00:20.075
a former head of the
League of Assassins,

00:20.077 --> 00:23.445
the three of us are going to
locate the Spear of Destiny;

00:23.447 --> 00:27.115
a mystical object which
can rewrite reality itself.

00:27.117 --> 00:28.750
With the Spear in our possession,

00:28.752 --> 00:31.586
we will change our past and our future.

00:31.588 --> 00:34.756
And the world as you know it.

00:34.758 --> 00:36.792
Previously on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

00:36.794 --> 00:38.627
A deep scan reveals that Captain Hunter's

00:38.629 --> 00:40.696
neural architecture
has been reprogrammed

00:40.698 --> 00:41.930
with a new identity.

00:41.932 --> 00:43.711
The Longinus Medallion.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.437
Rip!

00:47.462 --> 00:49.738
I know that you're one of the protectors

00:49.740 --> 00:52.507
of the Spear of Destiny
and I know that you know

00:52.509 --> 00:53.976
where the other pieces are hidden.

00:53.978 --> 00:55.911
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

00:55.913 --> 00:57.646
I'm not gonna torture you.

00:57.648 --> 00:59.781
They are.

01:06.290 --> 01:09.358
Damien Darhk, the man behind
tonight's siege of Star City,

01:09.360 --> 01:11.226
was killed by the masked vigilante

01:11.228 --> 01:12.995
known as the Green Arrow.

01:12.997 --> 01:15.697
Amateur cell phone video
captured his final moments,

01:15.699 --> 01:19.001
putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.

01:39.256 --> 01:41.890
This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?

01:41.892 --> 01:43.325
I am unimpressed.

01:43.327 --> 01:45.027
Well, he's fallen on hard times.

01:45.029 --> 01:49.525
But this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.

01:49.550 --> 01:52.344
Uh, we haven't met. I'm Eobard Thawne.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.447
I'm... from the future.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.149
What the hell is going on here?

01:57.151 --> 01:59.451
Excellent question. Here's another...

01:59.453 --> 02:01.620
Do you believe in second chances?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.722
I just watched you die.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.392
Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year,

02:06.394 --> 02:08.394
but I plan on fixing that.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.529
But the question for you, Malcolm, is:

02:10.531 --> 02:14.733
Do you wish to see your
fortunes similarly reversed?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.235
By time travel?

02:16.237 --> 02:18.771
No. No.

02:18.773 --> 02:21.173
Something much better.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.561
- Well?
- No luck. So far.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.430
It's not that Captain
Hunter's uncooperative.

02:44.432 --> 02:48.267
It's that he's not fully in
possession of his marbles.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.337
So he won't tell us where the
rest of the Spear of Destiny is?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.105
Uh, it's more like... can't.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.940
Which wouldn't be such a problem

02:54.942 --> 02:58.344
if you two idiots hadn't
lost the Longinus Medallion.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.679
I seem to remember
you being there as well.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.681
Until you weren't.

03:03.818 --> 03:05.451
I hate when he does that.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.386
If you have something
to say to me, Malcolm,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.455
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.023
I'm sorry.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.591
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

03:12.593 --> 03:15.461
Oh, I would be.
Considering I can kill you

03:15.463 --> 03:17.463
before you even knew I was doing it.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.764
Ah, yes.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.166
But then you wouldn't get what you want.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.636
You brought me and Damien into
your little quest for a reason.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.171
Without the Medallion,

03:26.173 --> 03:29.008
Hunter is our only way to
get the rest of the Spear.

03:29.010 --> 03:31.010
You need me to get it out of him.

03:31.012 --> 03:32.678
We already tried torture.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.413
I'm not talking about torture.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.515
I'm talking about hypnosis.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.350
Regression therapy.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.156
Hunter's mind is locked away.

03:44.158 --> 03:47.059
I've got the key.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.897
Is this some technique you picked up

03:51.899 --> 03:53.799
with the League of Assassins?

03:53.801 --> 03:56.635
The League didn't call me
“the Magician” for nothing.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.303
Well, be quick about it.

03:58.305 --> 04:02.908
Speedsters aren't
known for their patience.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.344
What's to keep Hunter's crew from finding

04:05.346 --> 04:06.678
the rest of the Spear

04:06.680 --> 04:07.946
before Merlyn finishes

04:07.948 --> 04:09.715
unscrambling Hunter's brain?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.183
The workings of the Medallion

04:11.185 --> 04:13.185
are lost to history.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.587
Trying to get it to reveal its
secrets will prove difficult.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.423
Plus, we have an additional
advantage over them.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.793
Enlighten me.

04:20.795 --> 04:22.094
They're idiots.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.762
- You're all idiots.
- Excuse me?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.364
Pot, meet kettle...

04:25.366 --> 04:26.598
Yeah, Mick. Given your glass house,

04:26.600 --> 04:27.695
you shouldn't throw stones.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.868
Mixing metaphors isn't
going to solve anything.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.900
How about instead of bickering,

04:30.924 --> 04:32.571
we figure out our next
move against the speedster

04:32.573 --> 04:33.649
and his allies.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.274
“Legion of Doom”
has a sexier ring to it.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.076
I'm not calling them that.

04:37.078 --> 04:39.611
And we need to figure
out a way to rescue Rip.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.214
All you gotta do is trade
the Amulet, or the Medallion,

04:42.216 --> 04:44.483
for the Englishman. It's really simple.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.285
The only thing is, I
don't know how it works.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.387
Hmm. You're an idiot.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.589
You want to put an artifact
that can rewrite reality

04:50.591 --> 04:52.758
into the hands of the
enemy and we're the idiots?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.226
- Mm-hmm.
- Our priority has to be

04:54.228 --> 04:55.928
identifying this speedster.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.564
Of course you'd say
that. I mean, he is the one

04:58.566 --> 04:59.832
that killed your boyfriend, so...

04:59.834 --> 05:00.902
He's at the center of this,

05:00.926 --> 05:02.601
and you can't defeat an
enemy that you don't know.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.869
Look, Amaya's right.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.904
And I hate to say it, but so is Mick.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.707
- I'm not an idiot.
- Not about being idiots.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.143
About using the Medallion as leverage.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.345
But first, we need to
figure out how it works.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.147
Well, in my defense,
it's a mystical object.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.882
It doesn't come with
a set of instructions.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.984
Maybe's that been the
problem, approaching it

05:18.986 --> 05:21.753
from a mystical vantage instead
of leaning into our strengths,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.021
- which are...
- Technological.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.656
Exactly. And as it happens,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.059
I have a colleague in
Central City whose knowledge

05:27.061 --> 05:29.795
might prove to be advantageous.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.232
Gideon, set a course
for Central City, 2017.

05:33.234 --> 05:34.900
Jax, stick with Martin.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.736
And let's work on putting
a name to our speedster.

05:39.974 --> 05:41.673
Aww, here comes a man

05:41.675 --> 05:43.442
who looks like he just struck out.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.177
Don't get smug with me, Damien.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.112
I may not have all my prior resources,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.947
but at least I'm not dead.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.482
Look, I couldn't get Hunter to remember

05:50.484 --> 05:54.119
because his memories aren't
buried or locked away.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.454
They're gone.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.457
It's like his old self didn't exist.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.092
Are you sure about that?

06:00.094 --> 06:01.360
Do you think you can do any better?

06:01.362 --> 06:02.661
You are welcome to try.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.929
We already tried torture.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.731
You know what I love about torture?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.666
I'm not sure if you have
enough time for me to list

06:07.668 --> 06:09.601
all the reasons, but mainly it's because

06:09.603 --> 06:12.337
there's always another gear to find.

06:14.141 --> 06:19.545
This is what I get for relying
on a washout and a dead man.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.713
I don't like that guy.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.218
Hmm, you know.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.053
I'll be honest.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.356
Which I have to admit, I
don't have much practice in.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.992
I don't like this situation.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.061
Not one bit.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.364
For one thing, Mr. Thawne
has this habit of treating me

06:39.366 --> 06:41.166
like a henchman.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.969
And do you know what all
henchmen have in common,

06:43.971 --> 06:47.072
Captain Hunter?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.840
No thoughts on this one?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.909
The thing that all
henchmen have in common

06:50.911 --> 06:53.612
is that they all end up dead.

06:53.614 --> 06:57.716
A fate that I am
fastidiously trying to avoid.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.952
Maybe it's that I just
hate taking orders.

06:59.954 --> 07:01.353
Or being threatened.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.689
You don't like being threatened, do you?

07:03.691 --> 07:05.891
Hm? What's that?

07:05.893 --> 07:08.660
Oh, sorry.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.562
Oh, God. No.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.930
Yeah, neither do I.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.166
Which is why I need your cooperation.

07:14.168 --> 07:18.003
To end Mr. Thawne's tedious threats.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.072
Look, I... I don't know anything.

07:20.074 --> 07:22.708
- I swear.
- Shhh!

07:22.710 --> 07:24.743
I can't take your word for it.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.211
But don't worry.

07:26.213 --> 07:31.116
I will start you off
with an easy question.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.685
Right eye or left eye?

07:33.687 --> 07:35.921
No, please. Please, don't.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.156
I'll do anything, I'll...
I'll tell you anything

07:38.158 --> 07:39.658
you want to know. Even
if I don't know it!

07:39.660 --> 07:41.593
- Please, don't!
- Shh.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.629
Second question.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.798
When was the last time you
had any dental work done?

07:46.800 --> 07:50.135
What? No, no, God.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.711
It may not be in the best
condition, but then again,

07:59.713 --> 08:01.313
Captain Hunter is British.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.315
You pulled out his tooth?

08:03.317 --> 08:06.118
As torture goes, isn't
that kind of bush league?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.919
Look closer.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.554
Thank you, but no.

08:15.229 --> 08:18.997
There're some markings
on here, like a barcode.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.433
Account information.
From a security deposit box

08:21.435 --> 08:23.068
in Switzerland.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.337
Who puts that kind of
information on a tooth?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.772
A Time Master.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.407
That's no ordinary security box.

08:28.409 --> 08:29.941
My thinking exactly.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.710
Now, it's possible the box could contain

08:31.712 --> 08:33.544
his son's birth certificate
and the like, but...

08:33.547 --> 08:36.048
Given the exotic nature of the
care that's been taken here,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.317
I would have to assume...
- It's the rest of the Spear.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.985
When was it last accessed?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.919
January 2025.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.525
Oh, you got somewhere to go?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.727
Funny, just like clockwork...

08:50.297 --> 08:52.397
Take the Time Sphere back to 2025

08:52.399 --> 08:54.533
and secure the rest of the Spear.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.967
The next one of you who screws up

08:55.969 --> 08:59.204
will lose more than just a tooth.

09:01.075 --> 09:03.975
Well, I'd hate to see you
lose another hand, Malcolm.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.352
Seriously, Grey?

09:13.354 --> 09:16.655
I know you didn't bring me
to 2017 just so we could get

09:16.657 --> 09:18.056
lattes and frappuccinos, man.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.391
Of course not.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.293
Just my colleague merely frequents

09:21.295 --> 09:22.661
this establishment at this hour.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.930
Sorry, Jefferson.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.131
You should go back to the Waverider.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.499
I can handle things from here.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.468
What the hell is going on with you, man?

09:29.470 --> 09:30.902
Dad?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.738
I didn't know you were coming to town?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.172
Dad?

09:34.197 --> 09:35.793
Well, I... I wanted to surprise you.

09:35.818 --> 09:36.775
Oh.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.810
Wait. Your colleague
is your daughter?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.212
Lily, this is my friend Jefferson.

09:40.214 --> 09:42.581
Jefferson, this is my daughter.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.982
Nice to meet you.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.717
Hey.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.153
- Should we, uh, sit down?
- Yeah.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.189
This is... So weird.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.160
Uh, because I didn't think
I'd get the chance to meet you.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.029
Like, ever. But, uh, here we are.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.266
I was explaining to Jefferson
how you might be able

10:01.268 --> 10:03.001
to assist us with the, um...

10:03.003 --> 10:04.803
Research project.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.805
Uh, sort of like Indiana Jones.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.975
Yeah, sort of.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.979
You brought it to a coffee shop?

10:15.282 --> 10:16.748
Oh, well, for one thing.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.985
It's throwing off low
levels of ionic radiation

10:19.987 --> 10:22.154
Is that an ionic transmographer?

10:22.156 --> 10:24.222
I've never seen one
smaller than a house!

10:24.224 --> 10:26.291
Yeah, I had an idea
for hyperminiaturization

10:26.293 --> 10:27.726
when I was in Tahiti.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.462
I don't vacation well.

10:30.464 --> 10:36.067
You know, I'm thinking a
shortwave ionic pulse might...

10:38.772 --> 10:40.138
Whoa!

10:40.140 --> 10:43.408
Hey.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.311
Perhaps we should, uh, take
our little research project

10:46.313 --> 10:50.048
somewhere a bit more private...

10:51.985 --> 10:54.419
A temporal navigation vessel.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.289
I... I absolutely cannot believe it.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.557
Um, hello, who are you?

10:58.559 --> 11:00.091
Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Lily.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.593
I'm... I'm Martin's daughter.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.228
We didn't know Martin had a daughter.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.030
Yeah, you told me
you didn't have kids.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.432
Well, I like to keep my
private life... private.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.134
There's private, and there's lying.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.335
Sara, do you know about this?

11:10.337 --> 11:14.406
Oh, I know all about this.

11:17.845 --> 11:18.844
What are you doing?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.479
Trying to make up my mind.

11:20.481 --> 11:22.781
I mean, Eobard has
such a delicious selection

11:22.783 --> 11:24.149
of killing devices.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.684
We can't just storm into the bank

11:25.686 --> 11:27.519
and demand to see the deposit box.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.054
We absolutely can.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.755
We're former members of
the League of Assassins.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.024
This operation requires subtlety.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.759
Not a bloodbath.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.395
Well, I... I'm sorry. I'm
not up on current events,

11:37.397 --> 11:40.131
But might this squeamishness
that I'm witnessing

11:40.133 --> 11:41.867
be the cause of your downfall?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.335
Hunter is an asset.

11:43.337 --> 11:46.137
One that we can use to gain
access to our objective.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.373
To not use him is foolish.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.375
Oh. Well, in that case,

11:50.377 --> 11:53.044
I would have to defer to
your superior expertise

11:53.046 --> 11:55.247
in foolishness.

11:55.249 --> 11:58.717
But if your plan goes south,
it's not our speedster friend

11:58.719 --> 12:01.152
you need to worry about.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.654
One thing I hate more

12:02.656 --> 12:06.157
than taking orders from him...

12:06.159 --> 12:07.826
is being threatened by you.

12:13.901 --> 12:18.336
Luckily, Damien...

12:18.338 --> 12:19.771
I don't find you threatening.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.336
What's the big deal?

12:34.361 --> 12:37.123
The professor didn't
have a kid, now he does.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.157
Mazel tov.

12:38.159 --> 12:39.039
Thank you.

12:39.064 --> 12:41.894
The big deal is Lily
is a Time Aberration,

12:41.896 --> 12:43.929
which was all well and good,

12:43.931 --> 12:47.833
until you plucked her out of
2016 and showed her a timeship,

12:47.835 --> 12:50.970
which could cause more aberrations.

12:50.972 --> 12:52.338
Hey, what you looking at me for?

12:52.340 --> 12:53.639
Because you were with him.

12:53.641 --> 12:55.608
I quite simply missed my daughter.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.410
If Lily's presence
on the Waverider posed

12:57.412 --> 12:59.311
any temporal issues, I'm sure Gideon

12:59.313 --> 13:00.913
would have detected them.

13:00.915 --> 13:03.682
Plus, Grey said Lily
could hook the Medallion

13:03.684 --> 13:05.351
up with Gideon, so...

13:05.353 --> 13:07.319
Wait, she wants to try
networking an ancient amulet

13:07.321 --> 13:08.788
with an advanced AI system?

13:10.124 --> 13:11.624
I'm totally helping.

13:11.626 --> 13:14.060
Fine. Then I would
appreciate it if you...

13:14.062 --> 13:18.230
If none of you would reveal to
her that she's an Aberration.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.512
Why you looking at me?

13:19.537 --> 13:21.801
So where are we on
identifying the speedster?

13:21.803 --> 13:23.869
I think the technical term is nowhere.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.304
All the speedsters the Flash faced

13:25.306 --> 13:27.239
are either dead or his friends.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.875
Or people he thought were
his friends and are now dead.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.144
Okay, we will figure this
out. And in the meantime,

13:32.146 --> 13:34.346
you and Lily keep working
with the amulet to figure out

13:34.348 --> 13:36.415
to figure out where the
rest of the Spear is.

13:37.652 --> 13:40.286
Who's to say he won't kill us anyway?

13:40.288 --> 13:44.790
Even after we've gotten
his precious spear?

13:44.792 --> 13:46.859
Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

13:46.861 --> 13:48.794
I don't know, man.
I don't know anything.

13:48.796 --> 13:50.763
I don't even know why you're
getting me to wear this...

13:50.765 --> 13:53.265
This... this... this...
This monkey suit.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.101
And my mouth is so sore.

13:55.103 --> 13:57.136
Quit whining.

13:57.138 --> 13:58.437
The fact of the matter is,

13:58.439 --> 14:00.606
we have something in common, Rip.

14:00.608 --> 14:01.640
My name is Phil.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.008
Whatever.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.844
We are both dealing with
unstable individuals.

14:04.846 --> 14:07.947
And that is not something I enjoy.

14:07.949 --> 14:10.916
Hey, this is not exactly a
walk in the park for me, either.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.385
Which is why

14:13.387 --> 14:17.723
you will do exactly as I say.

14:17.725 --> 14:20.259
And maybe, just maybe,

14:20.261 --> 14:22.495
you will make it through this alive.

14:22.497 --> 14:24.430
Cool. Right.

14:24.432 --> 14:27.600
Um, what... what is
it you want me to do?

14:27.602 --> 14:30.302
Tell me, Phil. Have you ever been

14:30.304 --> 14:31.670
to Switzerland?

14:42.416 --> 14:43.749
Put this in your ear.

14:43.751 --> 14:44.850
What is it?

14:44.852 --> 14:46.051
Communication device.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.254
Really? It's so small...

14:48.256 --> 14:50.289
Do it, or I'll shove
it down your throat.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.324
It will allow us to monitor you.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.059
This is very simple.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.428
You go to the bank
associate and you tell them

14:56.430 --> 14:59.098
you want to access security box 4587.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.666
4587, right.

15:00.668 --> 15:02.434
Um, what... What do I do then?

15:02.436 --> 15:04.003
Bring the contents
of said box back to us.

15:04.005 --> 15:05.538
If you don't, you'll be killed.

15:05.540 --> 15:06.739
Really?

15:06.741 --> 15:08.207
What? I'm motivating him.

15:08.209 --> 15:09.475
In and out.

15:09.477 --> 15:10.609
Take no longer than five minutes.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.311
You will be fine.

15:12.313 --> 15:14.213
I'll be fine.

15:14.215 --> 15:16.048
I'll be fine. Okay.

15:16.050 --> 15:19.385
This would be easier if
we just killed everybody.

15:21.656 --> 15:23.155
Hi, how are you?

15:23.157 --> 15:27.493
I'd like box 4587, please.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.028
Well, sure, have a seat.

15:31.132 --> 15:32.898
What do you think's going on with him?

15:32.900 --> 15:35.935
It's simple. His mind is pudding.

15:35.937 --> 15:37.937
Not Hunter. Thawne.

15:37.939 --> 15:40.639
It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long...

15:40.641 --> 15:43.442
Perhaps that's why they
refer to them as speedsters.

15:43.444 --> 15:46.879
What, you think he left us
behind in 1967, Los Angeles,

15:46.881 --> 15:49.515
because he had a more
pressing engagement?

15:49.517 --> 15:51.283
What about what he said to us earlier?

15:51.285 --> 15:52.885
That he wanted to kill one of us?

15:52.887 --> 15:55.554
No. That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

15:55.556 --> 15:57.189
I mean, fair question.

15:57.191 --> 15:58.557
Why does a time traveling speedster

15:58.559 --> 16:00.759
need to rely on anyone?

16:00.761 --> 16:03.162
Thawne's hiding something.

16:03.164 --> 16:04.830
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

16:06.934 --> 16:09.335
Thawne said we knew
each other back in 2016.

16:09.337 --> 16:11.003
Do I really become so stupid

16:11.005 --> 16:12.739
that you think these mind
tricks will work on me?

16:12.763 --> 16:13.988
I am not trying to...

16:14.013 --> 16:16.342
In a trio such as ours,
turning one against each other

16:16.344 --> 16:19.011
for your own benefit is not
only obvious, but cliché.

16:19.013 --> 16:21.647
Thawne does not treat
us as equals to him.

16:21.649 --> 16:25.384
And until he does, neither of
us is getting what he wants.

16:27.521 --> 16:29.555
All right. Let's go over this again.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.423
I already been over it, Sara.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.725
Mm-hmm, again and again.

16:32.727 --> 16:34.159
And again.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.562
We're obviously dealing
with a new player.

16:36.564 --> 16:38.364
Whoever this speedster
is, it's someone you

16:38.366 --> 16:40.065
and your friends haven't
encountered before.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.034
Which means the
speedster's from the future,

16:42.036 --> 16:44.770
which makes sense, because
speedsters can time travel.

16:44.772 --> 16:47.172
Then would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.408
He could just go back and
change history himself.

16:49.410 --> 16:50.776
But not reality.

16:50.778 --> 16:52.678
That's why he needs the Spear.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.681
Question is, what is the
speedster trying to change?

16:57.385 --> 16:59.051
Or fix?

16:59.053 --> 17:01.020
That's the question.

17:01.022 --> 17:03.088
He knows what we want to do
with the Spear of Destiny,

17:03.090 --> 17:05.257
but he's being very coy about his plans.

17:14.969 --> 17:17.770
Very well, Mr. Hunter.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.638
Please lean towards
the panel, if you would.

17:20.641 --> 17:22.141
Excuse me?

17:22.143 --> 17:23.509
A retinal scan.

17:23.511 --> 17:25.544
- Rectal scanner?
- What?

17:25.546 --> 17:28.513
It's an eye scan. Part
of the bank's security.

17:28.516 --> 17:29.581
You know,

17:29.583 --> 17:30.949
this whole situation sucks,

17:30.951 --> 17:33.585
but man, I love being in the future.

17:33.587 --> 17:36.855
- What?
- What?

17:36.857 --> 17:39.458
Retinal scan. Right.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.998
Oh.

17:48.836 --> 17:52.438
Why, uh... Why is it not working?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.806
Voice ID is next.

17:53.808 --> 17:56.809
You need to speak your access code.

17:56.811 --> 17:58.110
Access code.

17:58.112 --> 17:59.345
Oh, boy.

17:59.347 --> 18:01.146
Oh, boy.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.116
Yes, so, the one you set
when you opened your account.

18:04.118 --> 18:05.250
Uh...

18:05.252 --> 18:06.952
Get out of there now.

18:06.954 --> 18:08.454
Yeah.

18:08.456 --> 18:12.725
No, don't.

18:12.727 --> 18:14.560
Go. Move.

18:14.562 --> 18:16.995
Don't.

18:16.997 --> 18:18.328
This was your plan.

18:18.353 --> 18:20.232
Which I am trying to execute.

18:20.234 --> 18:22.835
And failing spectacularly, per usual.

18:22.837 --> 18:25.838
Look, we can't just
let them call security.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.406
I am calling security.

18:27.408 --> 18:29.174
Great idea. Security, no, that's...

18:29.176 --> 18:30.809
Security is awesome.

18:34.849 --> 18:37.649
You aren't planning on going
rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?

18:37.651 --> 18:40.586
I have told you. My name is Phil.

18:40.588 --> 18:42.287
All right, Phil. It
was lovely knowing you.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.489
Don't! We still need him.

18:43.491 --> 18:45.023
He's useless to us.

18:45.025 --> 18:46.525
Hey, I can be more useful.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.647
Ah, damn it.

18:47.649 --> 18:49.795
Security is gonna be on
top of us at any moment.

18:49.797 --> 18:51.964
Might I suggest you kill them instead?

18:51.966 --> 18:53.899
Try and run, and I will find you

18:53.901 --> 18:55.968
and feed you your testicles.

18:55.970 --> 18:57.903
Okay.

18:57.905 --> 18:59.505
Oh, my God.

19:02.777 --> 19:03.809
Ahh!

19:03.811 --> 19:05.744
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

19:18.159 --> 19:19.691
Reinforcements are on their way.

19:19.693 --> 19:22.528
Let's get the hell out of here.

19:37.295 --> 19:40.503
Okay, that should just about do it.

19:40.505 --> 19:42.372
And now we just have
to activate the Medallion

19:42.374 --> 19:44.374
and see if Gideon can access its data.

19:44.376 --> 19:47.010
Okay.

19:47.012 --> 19:51.080
So what are we waiting for?

19:51.082 --> 19:53.283
Nothing, it... It's just if...

19:53.285 --> 19:55.852
If we've underestimated the size
of the artifact's data stream...

19:55.854 --> 19:58.054
We'll fry the ship's
CPU and we'll all spend

19:58.056 --> 20:00.323
the rest of our lives
stranded in the Temporal Zone.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.349
The ship's CPU has a name.

20:02.374 --> 20:03.350
Sorry, Gideon.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.462
Can we at least talk about
this before you connect...

20:09.468 --> 20:11.801
Gideon?

20:11.803 --> 20:13.536
You still there?

20:13.538 --> 20:15.705
Oh, my God, we killed her.

20:15.707 --> 20:18.308
Artificial intelligences
cannot, by definition,

20:18.310 --> 20:19.770
be killed, Dr. Palmer.

20:19.795 --> 20:20.639
Yes, I know.

20:20.664 --> 20:23.012
It's pretty remarkable
considering we just mainlined

20:23.014 --> 20:25.782
1.2 zettabytes directly into her brain.

20:25.784 --> 20:26.615
Yeah.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.219
I'm processing the Medallion's
temporal output as we speak.

20:31.089 --> 20:33.753
- Nice work, doctor.
- Doctor!

20:33.778 --> 20:36.392
You don't happen to have any
champagne on this ship, do you?

20:37.696 --> 20:39.896
Hey.

20:39.898 --> 20:43.366
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.502
I like beer.

20:45.504 --> 20:47.670
Gets me drunk.

20:50.108 --> 20:52.208
To Lily.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.143
To Gideon.

20:57.916 --> 20:59.849
Wow.

20:59.851 --> 21:00.984
That tastes real.

21:00.986 --> 21:02.285
It's completely synthetic.

21:02.287 --> 21:04.387
The food fabricator can make anything.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.155
Except American Cheese,

21:06.157 --> 21:08.358
which is pretty much
synthetic to being with.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.792
Beluga caviar?

21:09.794 --> 21:11.895
Fake food never tasted so good.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.830
Fake food for a fake person.

21:17.202 --> 21:18.801
What did you say?

21:18.803 --> 21:20.778
Uh, no. He didn't say anything.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.574
Everyone has been looking
at me weird ever since

21:24.576 --> 21:27.020
I came on board this ship.

21:27.045 --> 21:28.945
What are you not telling me?

21:30.048 --> 21:31.514
Cat's out of the bag, Haircut.

21:31.516 --> 21:32.749
You may as well tell her.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.384
Tell me what?

21:34.386 --> 21:37.420
Tell me what?

21:37.422 --> 21:40.690
Sweetheart, I don't
wanna rain on your parade,

21:40.692 --> 21:42.492
but you're a, uh...

21:42.494 --> 21:44.994
How would the Professor put it?

21:44.996 --> 21:47.230
An abrasion... No, that's not it, um...

21:47.232 --> 21:49.532
An asphyxiation, hmm...

21:49.534 --> 21:51.167
Aber... Aberration!

21:51.169 --> 21:55.672
You're a Time Aberration.
You're a Time Aberration.

21:55.674 --> 21:58.274
Ray?

21:58.276 --> 22:00.877
What is a Time Aberration?

22:00.879 --> 22:04.213
Um, I think maybe you
should talk to your dad.

22:10.088 --> 22:12.488
Perhaps we could all just
talk about what went wrong.

22:12.490 --> 22:14.057
- Shh!
- Oh, I know what went wrong.

22:14.059 --> 22:15.725
I listened to him.

22:15.727 --> 22:17.703
If you'd have listened to
me, we would have walked out

22:17.727 --> 22:19.307
of that bank instead
of being chased out.

22:19.331 --> 22:22.332
Either way, we came out empty-handed.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.367
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning

22:24.369 --> 22:26.402
how he was going to punish your failure.

22:26.404 --> 22:28.304
If anyone's a failure, it's you.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.940
You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account,

22:30.942 --> 22:34.644
yet seem not to know about a passcode.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.112
Sloppy, Damien.

22:36.114 --> 22:37.814
No wonder they passed
you over for Ra's...

22:37.816 --> 22:39.983
You see, this is where he reminds me

22:39.985 --> 22:41.584
that he was Ra's al Ghul.

22:41.586 --> 22:43.753
Poor Malcolm. Always living in the past.

22:43.755 --> 22:47.090
This is when I remind
you about your future.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.626
Aww, that's right.

22:49.628 --> 22:51.260
I've been there.

22:51.262 --> 22:52.729
I've seen how pathetic you are.

22:52.731 --> 22:54.697
In this future that you're from,

22:54.699 --> 22:58.701
do I at least have two hands?

22:58.703 --> 23:02.639
Either way, I intend to change
my future, but look at you now.

23:02.641 --> 23:04.474
You're pathetic. I don't even know

23:04.476 --> 23:06.442
why Thawne recruited
you in the first place.

23:06.444 --> 23:07.844
We could argue all night, Damien,

23:07.846 --> 23:10.146
but I don't want to bore our guest here

23:10.148 --> 23:14.751
with your impotent
insults and recriminations.

23:14.753 --> 23:16.619
What are you suggesting?

23:16.621 --> 23:18.688
Do you recall how we resolved
disputes within the League?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.289
Mm-hmm.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.257
Now...

23:22.560 --> 23:24.794
I suggest you choose a blade

23:24.796 --> 23:27.296
that matches that sharp tongue of yours.

23:27.298 --> 23:29.966
Excuse me for a second.

23:29.968 --> 23:31.534
Gladly.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.171
You did it, my darling!

23:35.173 --> 23:37.640
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

23:37.642 --> 23:41.411
from the first century and
a 22nd century supercomputer.

23:41.413 --> 23:43.346
Only a Stein could be so brilliant!

23:43.348 --> 23:46.149
What is a Time Aberration?

23:46.151 --> 23:47.383
I'm sorry, what?

23:47.385 --> 23:50.720
You heard me, Dad.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.990
An Aberration... Is
an unnatural alteration

23:53.992 --> 23:56.893
of history as a result of time travel.

23:56.895 --> 24:01.564
Dad? Am I...

24:01.566 --> 24:03.332
Am I an Aberration?

24:03.334 --> 24:07.503
That word could never
describe who you are

24:07.505 --> 24:09.806
or how much you mean to me.

24:09.808 --> 24:11.808
- So it's true?
- Please let me explain.

24:11.810 --> 24:16.012
That's why you were acting so weird

24:16.014 --> 24:18.247
when you visited Central
City the first time.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.817
The reason you were
treating me like a stranger...

24:20.819 --> 24:22.952
Was because you didn't
even exist the last time

24:22.954 --> 24:25.822
I boarded this ship
and... And left 2016.

24:25.824 --> 24:28.691
But now you do exist and
that's all that matters.

24:28.693 --> 24:30.460
How could this be happening?

24:30.462 --> 24:32.662
But it's... it's... It's
really quite simple.

24:32.664 --> 24:37.066
You see, I interacted with
my younger self back in 1987.

24:37.068 --> 24:40.236
And who then interacted with
your mother's former self.

24:40.238 --> 24:41.938
And, and...

24:41.940 --> 24:43.840
When two former selves
love each other...

24:43.842 --> 24:46.042
Okay, Dad. We've already
had the birds and bees talk.

24:46.044 --> 24:49.178
I was ten. Or did we?

24:49.180 --> 24:51.214
That's a very interesting point.

24:51.216 --> 24:54.584
I... I mean, who is to say
which of our realities is real

24:54.586 --> 24:56.819
and which one is aberrant?

24:56.821 --> 24:58.788
It's really a matter of perspective.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.423
Actually, it's quite fascinating.

25:00.425 --> 25:03.459
This is not fascinating, Dad!

25:03.461 --> 25:05.895
This is a nightmare.

25:05.897 --> 25:07.597
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.

25:07.599 --> 25:09.599
This is not how I
wanted you to find out.

25:09.601 --> 25:12.268
No. No, I get it.

25:12.270 --> 25:13.870
You didn't want kids

25:13.872 --> 25:18.775
when you first came
on board this timeship.

25:18.777 --> 25:23.079
And now you have me.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.434
You just reminded me of something.

25:45.436 --> 25:46.636
Which is?

25:46.638 --> 25:48.838
How much I've missed this.

26:13.298 --> 26:16.299
Okay, stop, stop! Time out, time out!

26:16.301 --> 26:18.668
Can't you see that this
is what your boss wants?

26:18.670 --> 26:21.304
For his underlings to be
at one another's throats.

26:21.306 --> 26:23.606
Like, literally.

26:23.608 --> 26:24.807
He is not our boss.

26:24.809 --> 26:25.908
Did he call us underlings?

26:25.910 --> 26:27.243
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:27.245 --> 26:30.847
Uh... Henchmen.

26:30.849 --> 26:32.215
Try again.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.349
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:33.351 --> 26:34.383
What if he's right?

26:34.385 --> 26:35.685
You actually care

26:35.687 --> 26:37.320
what this pudding-brained
hippie has to say?

26:37.322 --> 26:38.721
It's just like the movie

26:38.723 --> 26:40.323
“The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”

26:40.325 --> 26:41.457
Three bad guys.

26:41.459 --> 26:43.059
No one knows who to trust.

26:43.061 --> 26:45.127
So they all end up
screwing each other over.

26:45.129 --> 26:47.063
It's an interesting theory.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.698
Which one are we?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.666
The point is that neither
of you are Clint Eastwood

26:50.668 --> 26:53.769
and so neither of you end
up going home with the gold.

26:53.771 --> 26:55.371
We're not after the gold.

26:55.373 --> 26:56.405
Yeah, I know, I know.

26:56.407 --> 26:57.840
I know what you're after.

26:57.842 --> 27:00.476
You... You wanna change your past.

27:00.478 --> 27:03.312
And you... You wanna change your future.

27:03.314 --> 27:05.014
And, uh, the fast guy is the only one

27:05.016 --> 27:09.185
who could make those
two things, uh, happen.

27:09.187 --> 27:10.753
I told you.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.488
Thawne doesn't treat us as equals.

27:12.490 --> 27:14.323
Even the hippie knows it.

27:14.325 --> 27:16.525
And he also knows that
the only way to stop Thawne

27:16.527 --> 27:20.830
from screwing us over is
for us to work together.

27:20.832 --> 27:23.833
Two former members of
the League of Assassins

27:23.835 --> 27:25.501
versus a speedster.

27:27.505 --> 27:29.164
I am liking those odds.

27:39.142 --> 27:41.843
Dude, what is going on with you?

27:41.845 --> 27:44.079
What do you mean?
And don't call me dude.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.081
I've gotten used to
sharing a brain with you.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.416
But, this, whatever this is.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.818
This is something new.

27:49.820 --> 27:53.354
Just enjoying a cup of Earl Grey.

27:53.356 --> 27:54.689
Is that whiskey?

27:54.691 --> 27:56.558
Of course it's not whiskey.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.726
It's brandy. What do you
take me for, a sailor?

27:58.728 --> 28:01.930
Okay. Let's start this over, hmm?

28:03.166 --> 28:05.066
Come on.

28:05.068 --> 28:09.337
Fine.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.225
I made a terrible mistake.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.642
I should never have brought
Lily on board this ship.

28:14.644 --> 28:17.846
She found out.

28:17.848 --> 28:19.714
She knows she's an Aberration.

28:19.716 --> 28:23.485
Mr. Rory spilled the
beans, as predicted.

28:26.423 --> 28:29.858
So what you gonna do?

28:29.860 --> 28:31.593
What can I do?

28:31.595 --> 28:32.794
Just tell her how you feel.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.095
She knows how I feel.

28:34.097 --> 28:35.330
It goes without saying.

28:35.332 --> 28:37.332
Yeah, for us, it does.

28:37.334 --> 28:39.968
We have a psychic
connection, but for her?

28:39.970 --> 28:44.372
She just hears whatever comes
out of that big brain of yours.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.407
Just tell her you love her.

28:46.409 --> 28:47.842
That's what dads do.

28:47.844 --> 28:50.078
Clearly, you never met my father.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.183
You know, the...

28:55.185 --> 28:57.886
The reason Clarissa and I
chose not to have children

28:57.888 --> 29:01.322
the first time around was because...

29:01.324 --> 29:03.892
I feared that history
would repeat itself,

29:03.894 --> 29:05.693
that I would be

29:05.695 --> 29:08.062
the kind of father that he was.

29:10.167 --> 29:13.801
We're legends, Grey.

29:13.803 --> 29:15.403
Changing history is what we do.

29:24.738 --> 29:27.010
Why would a speedster
need to change reality?

29:27.035 --> 29:29.951
Ohh. How many times are
you gonna ask that question?

29:29.953 --> 29:32.287
Until we have an answer.

29:32.289 --> 29:34.489
She's right. Speedsters can time travel.

29:34.491 --> 29:36.791
So what's stopping him
from changing history

29:36.793 --> 29:38.760
even without the Spear?

29:41.798 --> 29:44.499
Unless he doesn't exist.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.167
Okay, so what, he's a ghost?

29:46.169 --> 29:47.368
What if he's a Temporal Aberration?

29:47.370 --> 29:48.870
- Just like...
- Excuse me.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.181
Have any of you seen my daughter?

29:50.205 --> 29:51.506
- One second, Professor.
- I'm sorry!

29:51.508 --> 29:52.674
This is quite urgent.

29:52.676 --> 29:54.175
Look, what if instead of

29:54.177 --> 29:56.110
creating a person
like you did with Lily,

29:56.112 --> 29:58.880
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

29:58.882 --> 30:00.381
Why would he want to do that?

30:00.383 --> 30:02.016
I don't know, but it would explain

30:02.018 --> 30:04.619
why we don't have any
evidence of his existence.

30:04.621 --> 30:08.623
Okay, so, we just need to
ID someone who doesn't exist?

30:08.625 --> 30:10.959
Eobard Thawne.

30:10.961 --> 30:12.660
Um, is... Is he okay?

30:12.662 --> 30:14.896
I'm fine. Eobard Thawne is a name.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.966
The name of a speedster who...

30:17.968 --> 30:18.967
Who what?

30:21.271 --> 30:24.405
Thawne was erased from
existence when his progenitor,

30:24.407 --> 30:27.642
Eddie Thawne, committed
suicide in order to stop him.

30:27.644 --> 30:29.444
Which would explain why

30:29.446 --> 30:31.512
the Time Masters didn't
have a file on him.

30:31.514 --> 30:33.214
But if Thawne doesn't exist, then how?

30:33.216 --> 30:35.250
He was protected from
his ancestor's death

30:35.252 --> 30:37.051
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

30:37.053 --> 30:39.954
It's a little complicated.

30:39.956 --> 30:42.757
A little?

30:47.831 --> 30:49.430
Oh, and for the record,

30:49.432 --> 30:51.833
this is how I wanted to approach
things in the first place.

30:51.835 --> 30:54.102
Only because you enjoy
killing a lot of people.

30:54.104 --> 30:55.503
As if you don't.

30:59.309 --> 31:00.832
Hmm.

31:00.857 --> 31:02.944
All right, that's pretty
impressive, Malcolm.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.557
But how did you get Hunter's passcode?

31:04.582 --> 31:05.947
It's not Hunter's.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.650
It's the bank manager's
security override code.

31:08.652 --> 31:10.551
It only cost him three fingers.

31:15.392 --> 31:17.358
Uh, yes!

31:17.360 --> 31:18.459
Ow!

31:20.463 --> 31:21.729
Oh, God.

31:27.370 --> 31:28.836
Going somewhere?

31:28.838 --> 31:29.704
No.

31:31.508 --> 31:33.107
Yes.

31:33.109 --> 31:34.942
What do you expect me to do?

31:34.944 --> 31:38.780
Your partners just left
me here all tied up.

31:38.782 --> 31:40.982
Where are they?

31:40.984 --> 31:43.851
They... told me...

31:43.853 --> 31:45.586
Not to tell you.

31:47.057 --> 31:48.823
The bank. They're...
They're at the bank.

31:48.825 --> 31:50.825
Look, you could help yourself

31:50.827 --> 31:54.228
to... to whatever is in that
safe deposit box, but please...

31:54.230 --> 31:55.897
Please, just... Just let me go, man.

31:55.899 --> 31:57.065
Let me go.

32:12.182 --> 32:14.716
Does this look like a spear to you?

32:16.920 --> 32:18.753
It most certainly does not.

32:18.755 --> 32:20.355
It's a mnemonic archive.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.423
I'm sorry, are we supposed
to know what that means?

32:22.425 --> 32:24.726
Since it won't be
invented for a century, no.

32:24.728 --> 32:27.161
This device is designed
to store memories.

32:27.163 --> 32:28.896
Rip Hunter's, I'd assume.

32:30.734 --> 32:32.367
Guys, I think I just figured it out.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.669
Why a seemingly invincible speedster

32:34.671 --> 32:36.270
would need to take on partners.

32:36.272 --> 32:38.239
By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

32:38.241 --> 32:40.875
Okay. What if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

32:40.877 --> 32:42.944
What if he's running from something?

32:42.946 --> 32:44.579
But running from what?

32:44.581 --> 32:45.813
Time.

32:45.815 --> 32:47.582
Time takes time to harden.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.350
And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment

32:49.352 --> 32:50.752
his great-great-whatever
killed himself,

32:50.754 --> 32:53.955
then, maybe, he has to keep moving

32:53.957 --> 32:55.790
in order for his own nonexistence

32:55.792 --> 32:58.960
not to catch up with him. Poo!

32:58.962 --> 33:01.529
That doesn't even begin
to make any kind of sense.

33:01.531 --> 33:03.698
I don't know, it could work.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.200
Professor, what do you think?

33:06.202 --> 33:07.468
Per the scientific method,

33:07.470 --> 33:09.437
there's only one way to prove it.

33:09.439 --> 33:13.207
You'd have to trap Thawne in one
place and then see what happens.

33:16.146 --> 33:17.879
What do you think you're doing?

33:17.881 --> 33:20.348
Renegotiating the
terms of our partnership.

33:20.350 --> 33:22.950
And it is going to be a partnership.

33:22.952 --> 33:24.752
We need a bit more of a guarantee

33:24.754 --> 33:27.555
that you're going to uphold
your end of our bargain.

33:30.460 --> 33:33.127
I'll guarantee you one thing.

33:33.129 --> 33:35.329
If you don't open that door,

33:35.331 --> 33:37.665
I'll kill you.

33:37.667 --> 33:41.903
Yes, but I'm the only one
who knows the code to open it.

33:44.541 --> 33:46.574
Perhaps you can persuade
our friend to cooperate?

33:46.576 --> 33:47.408
Me? No.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.833
I'd rather see how this plays out.

33:49.858 --> 33:52.113
Aww.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.048
It seems you two have
formed an alliance.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.683
There's just one problem.

33:55.685 --> 33:56.918
That you're the only
one who could give us

33:56.920 --> 33:58.419
what we want... Yes, we know.

33:58.421 --> 33:59.954
You're always so quick to remind us

33:59.956 --> 34:02.790
how much we need you, Eobard.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.725
But, clearly, you need us.

34:04.727 --> 34:06.561
You could have gotten in
this vault all by yourself.

34:06.563 --> 34:07.528
Why didn't you?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.797
And for that matter...

34:10.800 --> 34:13.201
why would a man who
can travel through time

34:13.203 --> 34:14.668
always be in such a hurry?

34:14.670 --> 34:16.204
We don't have time for this.

34:16.206 --> 34:18.840
Oh, I've got all the time in the world.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.628
Okay!

34:27.630 --> 34:30.398
Okay, you two have made your point.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.400
I need you as much as
you need me, all right.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.636
But if you do not open that door,

34:35.638 --> 34:36.904
he is going to kill us.

34:36.906 --> 34:38.304
He is coming for me!

34:38.306 --> 34:39.806
Who's coming for you?

34:39.809 --> 34:41.542
It's not a who. It's a... it's a...

34:41.543 --> 34:44.011
A what? A thing.

34:44.013 --> 34:45.312
What thing?

34:45.313 --> 34:46.647
Can you be a little more specific?

34:46.649 --> 34:48.716
My ancestor killed himself in an effort

34:48.717 --> 34:50.317
to erase my very existence.

34:50.319 --> 34:52.719
Well, you look pretty spry despite it.

34:52.722 --> 34:54.755
The Flash pulled me from the timeline.

34:54.757 --> 34:57.725
He held me captive for months
and when I finally got loose,

34:57.727 --> 35:01.929
I found myself... pursued by something.

35:01.931 --> 35:03.831
I-I thought it was a time wraith,

35:03.833 --> 35:07.067
the monsters that hunt
speedsters who mess with time.

35:08.371 --> 35:10.871
But, whatever is hunting me is...

35:10.873 --> 35:15.643
far worse than a time wraith.

35:17.313 --> 35:20.481
It can sense the Speed Force.

35:20.483 --> 35:22.316
And it's trying to kill me.

35:22.318 --> 35:24.852
Interestin... so that's why
you keep running out on us.

35:24.854 --> 35:27.388
Huh. So you're kinda
like a shark who'll die

35:27.390 --> 35:28.856
if you stay in one place.

35:28.858 --> 35:30.157
We are all going to die if you don't...

35:33.162 --> 35:34.562
It's too late.

35:34.564 --> 35:36.964
It's here.

35:36.966 --> 35:38.899
Ah, well, the good
news is you two finally

35:38.901 --> 35:40.835
got what you wanted, you managed
to balance our partnership.

35:40.837 --> 35:42.169
We're now all equally dead.

35:42.171 --> 35:44.038
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.673
This isn't the first scary speedster

35:45.675 --> 35:47.508
that we had to put in his place.

35:47.510 --> 35:50.077
We're gonna get you out
of this bank vault, Eobard.

35:50.079 --> 35:51.612
But on one condition.

35:51.614 --> 35:54.815
You stop treating us like lackeys.

35:54.817 --> 35:58.085
You think you can stop that?

35:58.087 --> 36:00.120
Good luck!

36:00.122 --> 36:01.922
Was that a yes?

36:03.693 --> 36:04.758
- Yes.
- Great!

36:04.760 --> 36:05.960
Let's go to work.

36:05.962 --> 36:07.394
Right, so, you say this thing

36:07.396 --> 36:09.330
is attracted to the Speed Force?

36:09.332 --> 36:12.032
What if you don't use it?

36:12.034 --> 36:13.467
What are you suggesting?

36:13.469 --> 36:15.269
That you stop running.

36:30.653 --> 36:32.456
It knows I'm here.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.457
Good.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.322
Because we've only got one shot at this.

36:41.931 --> 36:45.165
Remember, as long as you stay still,

36:45.167 --> 36:46.567
he can't sense you.

37:11.127 --> 37:12.826
Easy, Eobard.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.274
Easy.

37:50.938 --> 37:52.466
It won't stay trapped for long.

37:52.468 --> 37:54.101
We have to go.

37:54.103 --> 37:57.004
We?

37:57.006 --> 37:59.039
We...

37:59.041 --> 38:00.841
Partners.

38:00.843 --> 38:01.942
Better.

38:07.750 --> 38:10.216
Gideon, can you please take
the ship back to Central City?

38:10.218 --> 38:12.485
If your goal is to return to 2017,

38:12.487 --> 38:14.320
I'm afraid your father has instructed me

38:14.322 --> 38:16.122
not to permit you to leave the ship.

38:16.124 --> 38:18.991
Well, considering he never
wanted to be my father,

38:18.993 --> 38:21.060
that should draw his parental dictates

38:21.062 --> 38:22.528
into question, wouldn't it?

38:22.530 --> 38:24.797
You share my fondness for erudition.

38:26.167 --> 38:29.568
You truly are my daughter.

38:29.570 --> 38:32.838
Well, I am sorry about that.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.708
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.344
For what?

38:38.346 --> 38:40.412
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

38:40.414 --> 38:44.016
Uh, I've made many mistakes
in my life, Lily, but you...

38:44.018 --> 38:47.653
most certainly are not one of them.

38:47.655 --> 38:50.656
The apology that I owe
you is for not telling you

38:50.658 --> 38:54.293
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

38:54.295 --> 38:56.695
You didn't want me to
know that you didn't want me.

38:59.934 --> 39:02.968
No, you're right, I...

39:02.970 --> 39:04.603
I didn't want children.

39:06.707 --> 39:09.708
But if there's one thing my travels

39:09.710 --> 39:13.012
aboard the Waverider have taught me,

39:13.014 --> 39:16.649
it's that time often doesn't
provide us with what we want.

39:16.651 --> 39:20.186
But it... it's quite adept
at giving us what we need.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.157
And I... I nel ed you...

39:25.159 --> 39:26.425
in my life...

39:28.729 --> 39:33.098
In ways that I... I could
never even dare to imagine.

39:39.173 --> 39:43.642
I just don't want there to
be any more secrets between us.

39:43.644 --> 39:47.246
Well, in that spirit, I
suppose I should tell you

39:47.248 --> 39:51.116
that I am one half of a
nuclear powered superhero

39:51.118 --> 39:53.085
called Firestorm.

39:55.356 --> 39:56.989
So not funny, Dad.

40:00.494 --> 40:03.729
Anyway, as fun as this was,

40:03.731 --> 40:08.000
I probably should be getting home.

40:08.002 --> 40:09.802
You're sure you can't stay?

40:09.804 --> 40:11.971
I... I would. I just, um...

40:11.973 --> 40:14.607
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

40:14.609 --> 40:17.509
that are not gonna
fold themselves, so...

40:17.511 --> 40:19.812
So then, I guess this is good-bye.

40:23.351 --> 40:25.517
Good luck folding those proteins.

40:25.519 --> 40:27.193
Good luck rescuing your friend, Rip.

40:27.218 --> 40:28.487
Hm.

40:35.029 --> 40:36.929
Bye, Dad.

40:53.147 --> 40:55.528
Feel no pressure to tell
us what all this techno-crap

40:55.553 --> 40:56.342
is about.

40:56.367 --> 40:58.017
We're sure we can
figure it out ourselves.

40:58.019 --> 41:00.252
This, uh, techno-crap,

41:00.254 --> 41:02.721
as you so eloquently put it,

41:02.723 --> 41:04.590
is Captain Hunter's memories.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.725
Including the locations
of the other pieces

41:06.727 --> 41:08.227
of the Spear, I hope.

41:08.229 --> 41:10.162
That is my working assumption, yes.

41:10.164 --> 41:12.264
All we have to do now
is upload his memories

41:12.266 --> 41:14.233
to his cerebral cortex.

41:14.235 --> 41:16.635
And that's not happening now because?

41:16.637 --> 41:20.205
Well, we would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

41:20.207 --> 41:22.775
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

41:22.777 --> 41:25.010
to address some of his shortcomings.

41:25.012 --> 41:27.446
What, like, stopping him biting his nails?

41:27.448 --> 41:31.150
Not exactly.

41:46.133 --> 41:48.467
Can I help you with something, soldier?

41:48.469 --> 41:50.336
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

41:51.806 --> 41:55.040
You, on the other hand...
