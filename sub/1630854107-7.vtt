WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:10.711
Nick?

00:10.811 --> 00:13.381
What are you doing?
(chuckles)

00:13.481 --> 00:17.485
Oh, it's, uh, it's called
the-the useless box.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.354
(laughs)

00:20.454 --> 00:21.989
That's all it does.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.824
What about the meeting?

00:23.924 --> 00:24.825
Don't judge me.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.760
You skipped
the meeting, too.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.961
Hey, guys.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.730
McGee,
what the hell?

00:29.830 --> 00:30.698
What?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.700
I asked you to,
you know,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.868
to go to that building
safety meeting for me.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.205
Yeah, it's all good.
I asked Parker to do it.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.607
And he agreed?
PARKER: No, he did not.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.177
But Kasie said she'd take notes
for all of us. Hey.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.478
Useless box.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.148
Let's see. (laughs)

00:47.248 --> 00:48.549
It's a classic.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.118
Guys, do you think we should
be feeling guilty

00:50.218 --> 00:51.419
about skipping
that meeting?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.087
Somebody has to stay
in the squad room

00:53.187 --> 00:54.622
in case we catch a case.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.024
Uh, we have Bandium
alerts for that.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.559
Not for walk-ins.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.927
Well, nobody
just walks in

01:00.027 --> 01:02.863
to NCIS and...
I'd like to report a crime.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.032
Actually, I would like
to report three crimes.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.568
Technically, it's one crime
attempted three times.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.303
Make that one felony
attempted three times.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.940
Uh, sir, slow down.
Take a breath.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.943
Uh, let's start with your name.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.545
It's Felix Lassiter.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.614
The felony that I would like
to report is attempted murder.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.817
The intended victim is me,
and the offender is my wife.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.254
Okay, are you active duty
or retired?

01:26.354 --> 01:27.888
I-I'm not in the military.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.623
Then you're gonna
have to file a report

01:29.723 --> 01:31.525
with your local
police department.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.727
Yeah, we don't have jurisdiction
to investigate.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.797
Sure you do. I came
to the right place because...

01:36.897 --> 01:39.133
because my wife is your boss.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.669
My wife,

01:41.769 --> 01:44.638
the Secretary of the Navy,
is trying to kill me.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.978
* *

02:21.275 --> 02:23.311
All right.
Right down here.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.279
Please, uh, have a seat.
Make yourself

02:25.379 --> 02:26.614
at home,
Mr. Lassiter.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.916
I'm not a mister. Call me Felix.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.352
All right, Felix, uh,
do you want some coffee?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.921
Do you have any
diet peach kombucha?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.024
Uh, we are fresh out.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.362
Why don't you go ahead
and sit tight, and, uh,

02:41.462 --> 02:42.963
we'll be
right back.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.570
There's only one Secretary
of the Navy, right?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.171
Yeah, Tara Flynn.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.706
And she is married to that guy?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.375
KNIGHT:
For 33 years.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.911
Here is a picture of them at the
Navy Christmas Gala last year.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.415
What does he do for a living?
Not much,

03:01.515 --> 03:04.385
but I think he fancies himself
as some kind of inventor.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.254
He has six patents
pending, all for

03:06.354 --> 03:07.921
tiny wheel gears or something.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.957
Well, they do say
opposites attract.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.060
No, no, no. Opposites is,
uh, Jimmy and Knight.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.029
You find out anything else
about him?

03:16.129 --> 03:18.666
No criminal record,
no outstanding warrants.

03:18.766 --> 03:22.035
Oh, I did find out that
he is the current president

03:22.135 --> 03:24.472
of the Toy Train
Operating Society.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.241
Well, that explains his love
for tiny wheels.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.742
Hmm.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.945
Sorry about that,
Felix.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.213
Please.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.818
Why don't you just, uh,
start from the beginning.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.554
My wife... has tried to kill me

03:40.654 --> 03:43.123
not once, not twice,
but three times.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.425
What happened?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.327
It started last week.

03:46.427 --> 03:50.030
I was driving along when, all of
a sudden, bam, my brakes failed,

03:50.130 --> 03:52.766
and I swerved right off
the road, right into a tree.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.736
Totaled my truck,
and somehow I walked away.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.105
But how exactly is that
attempted murder?

03:58.205 --> 03:59.607
I'm not done.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.942
The other night,
I'm watching TV in my apartment,

04:02.042 --> 04:03.644
and I hear this
annoying beeping noise.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
Hey, hold up, hold on,
hold on. Apartment?

04:05.846 --> 04:07.481
You and your wife
don't live together?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.882
No, we do not because she-she

04:08.982 --> 04:10.651
kicked me out.
We're getting divorced.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.488
Anyway, the beeping noise
turned out to be

04:14.588 --> 04:16.357
the carbon monoxide alarm.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.025
And?

04:18.125 --> 04:22.229
And what? I almost died
for the second time.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.898
And last but not least,

04:24.998 --> 04:27.801
this morning, I was attacked.
TORRES: Okay.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.438
Attacked, that's something
we can work with.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.205
I was out for my regular walk,

04:32.306 --> 04:34.642
and a green Cadillac
with a dent on the fender

04:34.742 --> 04:37.778
comes out of nowhere,
tries to plow me down,

04:37.878 --> 04:39.813
and I jumped out of the way.
I came straight here.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.148
Does your wife own

04:41.248 --> 04:42.916
a green Cadillac
with a dent in the fender?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.952
Well, no, but if she was gonna
run me over,

04:45.052 --> 04:47.555
she wouldn't do it herself.
She obviously hired a hit man.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.256
Mm. Obviously?

04:49.357 --> 04:51.659
Yes, Agent Torres. Uh...

04:51.759 --> 04:55.128
I'm telling you people,
my wife wants to kill me.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.865
Did she tell you that?
She didn't have to.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.634
Last week, she came over
and destroyed

05:00.734 --> 05:03.637
my prized Lionel train set,
1976 edition.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.573
TORRES:
So, even if this is true,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.908
it still doesn't prove
that she's a murderer.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.644
Well, somebody's
trying to kill me.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.012
Who else would it be?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.647
McGEE:
Well, did you ever

05:13.747 --> 05:16.684
consider that these three events
were accidents?

05:16.784 --> 05:19.887
Three near-death accidents
in less than a week?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.556
Felix, do you have
any evidence at all

05:22.656 --> 05:26.093
that your wife is responsible
for any of these incidents?

05:26.193 --> 05:28.128
FELIX:
Isn't that your job?
I was kind of hoping

05:28.228 --> 05:30.664
that NCIS would open
an investigation

05:30.764 --> 05:32.232
before I end up dead.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.601
No, don't worry.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.903
We're looking for your wife
as we speak.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.607
I'm sorry, Director, but
Secretary Flynn's unavailable.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.074
She just left on a flight
to Amsterdam

05:41.174 --> 05:42.976
to address NATO's
Security Council.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.311
Please let her know
we'd like

05:44.412 --> 05:45.913
to speak to her
as soon as she lands.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.415
You'll be her first call.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.849
In the meantime, if it's okay,

05:48.949 --> 05:51.318
we'd like to talk to you.
About?

05:51.419 --> 05:52.653
Her husband.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.255
Oh, boy. (sighs)

05:55.355 --> 05:56.957
What's Felix claiming now?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.726
What do you mean now?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.194
Felix is what I call a hot mess.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.997
He's a nice guy, and I know
he loves the secretary,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.399
but the guy's basically nuts.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.668
Last year, he thought
the secretary was having

06:07.768 --> 06:09.770
an affair with
the Sultan of Brunei.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.405
I take it she wasn't.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.340
Is he being serious, Director?

06:13.441 --> 06:14.942
I can't tell through the screen.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.910
Just continue, Rafa.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.012
After years of all
his conspiracy theories,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.848
she finally had enough
and kicked him out.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.816
But he's dragging his feet
on the divorce

06:22.916 --> 06:25.318
because he thinks he can
somehow win her back.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.854
He's delusional.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.622
Did she go to his apartment

06:28.722 --> 06:30.491
and smash his model train set?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.259
I highly doubt it,

06:32.359 --> 06:34.662
but even if she did,
I'm sure he deserved it.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.197
Felix has put the woman
through hell.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.801
But this isn't about trains,
is it?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.235
Would it be possible to see

06:42.335 --> 06:44.738
the secretary's itinerary
from last week?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.407
Of course.
I'll send it right over.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.877
Thank you, Rafa.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.547
Tread lightly on this.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.683
The press finds out that
we're even questioning SECNAV

06:55.783 --> 06:57.417
about a crime,
she's done politically.

06:57.518 --> 07:01.489
You're saying investigate
the Secretary of the Navy?

07:01.589 --> 07:02.623
We have no choice.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.257
A report's
been filed.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.961
Something tells me that,
uh, you don't buy any of this.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.998
I've met Felix a few times
over the years.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.733
He cornered me once
to talk about

07:12.833 --> 07:15.035
robot birds
and laser beam cancer.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.237
(scoffs) Robot birds?

07:17.337 --> 07:18.839
He's a whack job,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.741
and I'm not going to
allow him to drag

07:20.841 --> 07:22.610
the secretary down
on his way out the door.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.244
And speaking of doors,

07:24.344 --> 07:27.280
please escort
Mr. Lassiter to ours.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.184
So, now what?
What, just go home?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.286
Well, if anything else happens,
give us a call.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.322
We'll check it out.
Uh... (stammers)

07:35.422 --> 07:37.525
That's reassuring.
If anything else happens,

07:37.625 --> 07:39.860
you'll probably find me
in a pool of my own blood.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.331
(heavy breathing)

07:45.833 --> 07:47.234
McGEE:
Felix, you okay?

07:47.334 --> 07:50.070
Sir, are you prone to
panic attacks? Whoa, whoa.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.972
Felix, Felix.
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.907
Felix, Felix,
breathe.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.042
Call an ambulance.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.510
Okay, this is not
a panic attack.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.611
(labored breathing)

07:57.711 --> 07:59.947
Come on, breathe through it.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.092
TORRES:
This guy had a hell of a week.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.562
Honestly, I thought it was
all just in his head,

08:14.662 --> 08:16.697
but then the way he was
foaming from the mouth...

08:16.797 --> 08:19.366
You think it was poison?
It looked that way to me.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.934
But even if
he was poisoned,

08:21.034 --> 08:23.937
we still don't know that
SECNAV was behind it.
True.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.374
Good morning, Agents.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.976
I'm Dr. Singh.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.143
How's he doing?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.579
He is stabilized.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.280
We believe the seizure
was caused

08:33.380 --> 08:34.882
by a pre-existing
heart condition.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.684
Are you aware that,
when he collapsed,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.586
he was telling us that someone
was trying to kill him?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.087
SINGH:
Yes, which is why we ran

08:40.187 --> 08:42.923
a comprehensive blood test
to search for any toxins.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.391
It came back clean.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.795
Wow, so he was just the
unluckiest dude in the world?

08:47.895 --> 08:51.398
He almost dies while telling us
how he almost died?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.066
Well, it's quite possible
that his other

08:53.166 --> 08:56.303
near-death experiences helped
trigger this cardiac event.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.338
Well, we're still gonna
have to run our own blood test

08:58.438 --> 08:59.940
just to be sure.
Of course.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.210
When can we talk to him?
He'll wake up in a few hours.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.712
In the meantime,
his daughter Arlene

09:04.812 --> 09:06.046
would like to speak to you.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.381
Honey, your dad's strong.
He's gonna be okay.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.450
Arlene?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.954
I'm Special Agent Knight,
this is Special Agent Torres.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.155
Nice to meet you.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.523
This is my husband

09:16.624 --> 09:18.391
Victor.
Hi.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.060
Sorry about
your dad.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.631
Yeah, I'm just relieved it seems
like he's gonna be okay...

09:23.731 --> 09:24.632
again.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.866
Again?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.335
Felix has had
these episodes before.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.270
But all those other times,

09:30.370 --> 09:32.539
NCIS hasn't showed up.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.843
Why are you, why are you here?

09:35.943 --> 09:39.579
Um... Have a seat.

09:42.683 --> 09:46.519
Your father was at our office
when he collapsed.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.357
Why would my dad
be at your off...

09:51.825 --> 09:53.193
(scoffs)

09:53.293 --> 09:55.395
He came in to report that my mom

09:55.495 --> 09:57.698
is trying to kill him,
didn't he?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.399
Oh, so you know how he feels?

09:59.499 --> 10:00.801
Yes, he told me.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.203
And I told him I loved him,

10:03.303 --> 10:05.005
but he's crazy.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.306
I hope this goes

10:06.406 --> 10:07.675
without saying,
but believe me,

10:07.775 --> 10:10.510
my mom is not trying
to murder my father.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.079
Did they fight a lot?

10:12.179 --> 10:13.781
They always fight a lot.

10:13.881 --> 10:17.217
Felix can be
a little bit exasperating.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.585
Hmm.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.588
My dad is... he's brilliant,

10:21.689 --> 10:23.056
but he's complicated.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.158
I know he seems
a little more than odd,

10:25.258 --> 10:26.694
but he's a great father.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.996
And he's been struggling lately

10:29.096 --> 10:30.931
because he's losing
the woman he loves.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.334
And because he thinks that woman
is trying to kill him.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.136
VICTOR:
Arlene already told you,

10:36.236 --> 10:38.538
her mother would never do
something like that.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.708
We're not accusing
your mother of anything.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.176
We're just trying to find out
if Felix is in danger.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.712
Wait, are you saying someone

10:44.812 --> 10:46.613
might actually be trying
to kill my dad?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.215
We're saying we don't know yet.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.616
Does he have any enemies?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.018
ARLENE:
No.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.553
I mean, he doesn't really
have any friends either.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.556
All he's ever had
was my mom and us.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.627
A-And now he's only got us.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.396
PARKER:
Felix's truck?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.199
Yeah, near-death
experience number one.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.568
The first domino that kicked off
a very bad week.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.837
All right, take me through it.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.005
I spoke with Felix's
auto mechanic.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.775
He inspected the brakes
and confirmed that they failed.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.576
Failed or were sabotaged?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.845
Yeah, mechanic couldn't tell.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.446
Truck was
an old clunker.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.148
Maybe the brake line
was cut,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.515
maybe it rotted.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.717
Let's inspect it
ourselves.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.485
Oh, it's too late.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.520
Mechanic sent it
to the junkyard yesterday.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.157
Got crushed into the size
of a suitcase.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.324
Efficient junkyard.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.093
Uh, speaking of, uh, cars,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.896
I was able to find a witness
who confirmed Felix's story

11:35.996 --> 11:37.865
about nearly getting hit
on his morning walk.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.867
By a green Cadillac
with a dent in the fender?
Yup.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.870
All right. Witness get a plate
or a description of the driver?

11:42.970 --> 11:44.972
No. The witness actually said
that it could've been

11:45.072 --> 11:47.540
Felix's fault for walking
too close to the road.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.211
What about the other
near-death experience?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.781
Felix's furnace.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.883
Had a plumber
look at it. He found

11:55.983 --> 11:58.451
a hole in the heat
exchanger, which was

11:58.551 --> 12:00.653
leaking carbon monoxide
into the apartment.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.589
Plumber couldn't tell
if it was because

12:02.689 --> 12:04.291
of rust
or a screwdriver.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.426
So, we know a lot more

12:06.526 --> 12:08.195
but don't know anything more.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.262
Basically, yeah.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.831
You think we're being

12:10.931 --> 12:13.033
karmically punished for skipping
that mandatory meeting?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.935
(phone rings)

12:15.735 --> 12:17.938
Kasie's got
something.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.273
(indistinct conversation)

12:20.373 --> 12:22.542
Hey, it's the dynamic duo.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.546
What is it?

12:28.215 --> 12:31.251
I ran a full tox screen
on Felix's blood,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.320
then I ran it again.
And?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.223
And then she called me down here
to triple-check her findings.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.191
Which are?
KASIE: Clean.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.660
Just like the doctor said.
PARKER: But I'm guessing you

12:40.760 --> 12:42.796
didn't call me down here
just to tell me that.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.097
JIMMY:
And you would be
guessing correctly

12:44.197 --> 12:45.866
because it's what
Kasie didn't find

12:45.966 --> 12:47.434
that raised her suspicions.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.502
Felix's blood
showed decreased

12:49.602 --> 12:50.938
erythrocyte
cholinesterase,

12:51.038 --> 12:53.540
a common sign
of excessive absorption

12:53.640 --> 12:55.575
of organophosphate compounds.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.011
Organophosphates are,
uh, natural poisons,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.579
usually found in insecticides.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.714
KASIE:
So, then I ran
a secondary test

13:01.815 --> 13:03.350
that the hospital
didn't think to perform,

13:03.450 --> 13:06.553
and it showed trace amounts
of adenosine in his system.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.821
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.890
Oh, it's a very deadly
nerve agent.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.492
It was developed by the Russian
military for use in warfare.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.863
Well, does the U.S. Navy
have adenosine in its arsenal?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.697
Well, sure, but they would
never use it in warfare,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.199
they only use it for research.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.969
Uh, the Navy has it stored
in secured facilities,

13:22.069 --> 13:24.504
but only
a dozen people have

13:24.604 --> 13:26.739
authorization to access it.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.243
One of which just so happens
to be Felix's wife.

13:41.788 --> 13:44.157
Am I the only one
who thought this Felix guy

13:44.257 --> 13:46.126
was just nuts?
Oh, no.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.527
As soon as I met him,
I thought he was

13:47.627 --> 13:49.462
a few sandwiches
short of a picnic.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.832
It's a saying.
Y-You know, people

13:52.933 --> 13:54.267
say that.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.137
The point is, is that
Felix's crazy story

13:57.237 --> 13:58.605
doesn't sound
so crazy anymore.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.374
Yeah, well, all we know
is that he was poisoned.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.911
We don't know if SECNAV
was the one who did it.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.313
That's why we ask her.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.950
Wait, you mean interrogate her?

14:10.050 --> 14:10.951
Yeah.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.285
Follow the evidence

14:12.385 --> 14:14.021
and interrogate the suspect,

14:14.121 --> 14:15.655
like we always do.

14:15.755 --> 14:18.391
Yeah, Tim, but the suspect
is the Secretary of the Navy.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.161
I know.
Our boss's

14:21.261 --> 14:23.130
boss.
I know.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.266
Who can fire
everyone

14:26.366 --> 14:28.301
in here.
None of that matters.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.137
We have to treat her
like any other suspect.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.271
(elevator bell dings)

14:31.371 --> 14:32.539
(clears throat)

14:32.639 --> 14:34.541
TORRES:
And there's your suspect.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.915
Okay, you let us know
how that goes.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.785
(door opens)

14:45.885 --> 14:47.020
(door closes)

14:47.120 --> 14:48.989
What did I miss?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.124
Nothing yet.
She just sat down.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.026
TORRES:
Yeah, she looks pissed.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.996
Well, she's about to be
interrogated by her own agents.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.365
I'm sure she's had
better days.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.604
Ooh, here we go.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.714
The first thing I want to say
to both of you...

15:14.814 --> 15:16.516
is I'm sorry.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.786
What?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.288
Plot twist.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.922
Sorry for what?

15:23.023 --> 15:25.258
For Felix.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.127
For the chaos
he's caused.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.661
Not that I'm surprised.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.198
I've been apologizing
for his antics for 33 years.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.966
What antics exactly?

15:33.066 --> 15:37.237
We don't have time to go down
that rabbit hole, Agent Parker.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.173
Let's just get to the part

15:40.273 --> 15:42.609
where you ask me
uncomfortable questions.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.279
Madam Secretary,

15:46.379 --> 15:48.781
have you ever tried

15:48.881 --> 15:50.150
to kill your husband?

15:50.250 --> 15:53.086
No. Of course not.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.188
I want to divorce
the man, not kill him.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.824
What about
his train set?

15:57.924 --> 15:59.526
Oh, I murdered that.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.229
I'm not proud of it, but when
I went over to his apartment

16:02.329 --> 16:04.664
to ask why he hadn't signed
the divorce papers yet, he was

16:04.764 --> 16:08.168
running his little
Polar Express, wearing that

16:08.268 --> 16:11.171
damn conductor hat,
and I lost it.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.672
How did these two
end up together?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.907
You never know
where Cupid's arrow lands.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.344
Yeah, well, Cupid misfired.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.112
The truth is,

16:19.212 --> 16:21.648
Felix is his own worst enemy.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.683
With the
conspiracy theories

16:23.783 --> 16:25.618
and the overactive
imagination.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.122
I-I'm sure it was just stress
that caused this heart episode.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.324
It wasn't stress.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.826
He was poisoned.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.362
What?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.097
Are you sure?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.931
Does our daughter know?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.900
Yeah, we just
contacted her, yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.702
Well, then I hate
to cut this short,

16:42.802 --> 16:45.205
but my family needs me
right now. I have to see Felix.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.840
Uh, we can't let you
do that, ma'am.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.376
Why?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.782
Because you think
I poisoned him.

16:55.882 --> 16:59.786
Well, we identified the toxin
in his bloodstream as adenosine.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.622
Never heard of it.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.425
It's a nerve gas that,
with your clearance,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.627
you would have access to.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.497
I did not poison my husband,

17:10.597 --> 17:12.065
but if what you say is true,

17:12.165 --> 17:13.433
someone is trying to kill him.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.469
Do you have any idea
who this someone may be?

17:18.838 --> 17:21.574
This would not be the time
to hold back.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.943
I haven't told this to anyone

17:24.043 --> 17:25.578
outside of my own family,

17:25.678 --> 17:28.781
but Felix has
a gambling problem.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.219
(scoffs) It's not a problem,
it's an addiction.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.486
How bad?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.523
Bad enough to lose
our life savings

17:36.623 --> 17:38.958
and our daughter's college fund.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.693
Who did Felix owe?

17:40.793 --> 17:44.063
His bookie,
who does not take IOUs.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.465
This bookie have a name?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.200
Olev Kozlov.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.902
Olev. Is he Russian?
Yes.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.872
And I wouldn't be surprised if
he had ties to the Russian mob.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.008
I told Felix not to mess
around with this guy,

17:56.109 --> 17:57.744
but he didn't listen.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.612
Do you know where he operates?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.614
He runs an illegal casino

18:01.714 --> 18:04.351
out of the back of his pawnshop
in Alexandria.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.419
KNIGHT:
Doesn't make sense to me.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.054
McGEE:
What, a casino in a pawnshop?

18:08.155 --> 18:09.589
No, not that part.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.658
Why a bookie would kill
one of their own clients.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.893
I mean, if Felix dies,
then bookie doesn't get paid,

18:13.993 --> 18:15.595
so, seems like murder's
bad for business.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.297
Yeah, so is letting
word get out

18:17.397 --> 18:19.399
that your clients
don't have to settle up.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.368
Maybe you're right.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.636
Green Cadillac.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.674
With a dent
in the fender.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.742
I guess some bookies do kill.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.078
("Mr. Gangster" by Tigerman
playing)

18:34.647 --> 18:37.250
(rapping in foreign language)

18:37.350 --> 18:39.386
* Gangster... *

18:40.553 --> 18:42.054
* Mr. Gangster... *

18:43.356 --> 18:44.591
* Mr. Gangster... *

18:47.294 --> 18:48.961
Hey. You open?

18:49.061 --> 18:50.963
I'm here, ain't I?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.701
Oh, that's
a nice bike.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.169
You ride?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.604
Nope.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.106
You got a name?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.808
Yep.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.045
Hey, get away from there!

19:07.280 --> 19:09.249
NCIS. Sit down.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.584
McGEE:
We got a locked back room.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.421
Is your boss back there?

19:15.555 --> 19:18.625
Do you have a key to that door?

19:24.531 --> 19:27.434
Sit tight.
We'll be back.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.440
You need to work
on your people skills.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.177
NCIS.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.649
Put your hands where we can
see 'em, guys. Come on.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.918
You Olev?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.220
Da.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.489
KNIGHT:
You, over next to him.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.360
You two, stay right there.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.528
You make mistake.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.365
This is for recreational
purpose only.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.233
KNIGHT:
We'll worry about
your casino later.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.336
Right now you're being arrested
for attempted murder.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.705
Murder? No, I kill no one.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.207
But you tried to kill
Felix Lassiter.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.742
Felix?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.678
Oh, no, no, I love Felix.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.580
Felix a good man.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.715
And how much did
this good man owe you?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.084
Oh, Felix, he retired.
No more bets.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.187
He does
Gamblers Anonymous now.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.390
You care to explain why your car

20:23.490 --> 20:26.693
tried to run down your
good buddy Felix this morning?

20:26.793 --> 20:29.396
No, my car never hurt nobody.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.364
Where were you at 7:45 a.m.?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.400
Not driving my Caddy.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.335
Car is mine, da.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.371
I no drive. Bad eyes.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.472
Who drives it?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.007
Zero.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.443
My associate.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.445
That guy's name out there
is Zero?

20:45.545 --> 20:46.713
Da.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.048
Fitting.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.551
McGEE:
All right, were you
driving this car

20:51.651 --> 20:54.354
this morning at...?
Yeah, I was. I did it.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.155
You didn't let him finish.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.891
I don't have to.
I did it.

20:58.991 --> 20:59.826
Did what?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.628
Tried to run Felix over.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.730
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.333
Well, we appreciate the honesty.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.767
I do not.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.769
You could have wrecked my Caddy.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.038
Hands behind
your back.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.040
Whoa. Why, man?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.075
'Cause we're arresting you
for attempted murder.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.378
It may come as a shock,
but trying to hit somebody

21:18.478 --> 21:19.712
with your car is illegal.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.682
What if they asked you
to do it?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.752
Didn't see that coming, huh?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.987
Felix asked you to run him over?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.690
Yeah.
KNIGHT: Yeah, no,
we're not believing that.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.659
That's why I kept
the receipts.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.627
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.629
It's only my phone.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.532
Me and Felix texted
all about it.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.402
Said he was sick of life.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.504
His heart condition,
his divorce,

21:44.604 --> 21:45.872
couldn't gamble.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.807
He paid me two Gs for it.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.309
You got your money,
why didn't you kill him?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.378
I tried, man.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.179
Swerved right at him.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.615
He jumped out
of the way.
Why?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.684
Don't know,
don't care.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.952
All I know,
I got my two Gs.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.253
KNIGHT:
Well, good.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.555
You can use that cash
as a down payment

22:02.655 --> 22:03.956
on your defense attorney.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.658
Yeah, now you're under arrest.
Turn around.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.259
Come on, why?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.662
Because murder for hire
is illegal,

22:09.762 --> 22:11.964
even if the client
is also the victim.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.199
Seriously?

22:13.299 --> 22:15.768
Parker, you're not gonna
believe this.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.471
(elevator bell dings)

22:18.571 --> 22:20.139
He asked
to be run over?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.941
(sighs) Apparently.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.175
Why?

22:23.275 --> 22:25.111
Well, maybe he got so mad
at his ex-wife

22:25.211 --> 22:28.581
that he decided to frame her
for attempted murder.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.983
You mean
he set it all up?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.952
He cut his own brake line?

22:33.052 --> 22:35.054
He punctured his own heater
and asked to be run over?

22:35.154 --> 22:37.424
And the coup d'état is,
he poisoned himself

22:37.524 --> 22:39.926
so he would collapse
right in front of us.

22:41.761 --> 22:42.995
He'd done
some research,

22:43.095 --> 22:45.898
he would've known how much
aden... whatever

22:45.998 --> 22:47.867
he could have taken
and still survived.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.937
And all the bread crumbs
would lead right to SECNAV.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.739
You really think he hates
his wife that much?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.874
Let's ask him.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.361
VANCE:
So, he just waltzed out
of the hospital?

23:15.462 --> 23:16.829
Nurses were changing shifts.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.498
Well, what about
the security cameras?

23:18.598 --> 23:21.200
Well, Kasie is pulling
parking lot video as we speak.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.902
I think we should warn SECNAV.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.738
I already did.
I also ordered her a 24-hour

23:25.838 --> 23:27.574
protection detail.
Good call.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.342
SECNAV didn't think so.
She sent the detail home.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.479
She said she's not afraid
of her husband.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.781
Well, maybe
she should be.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.316
Why do you think Felix ran?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.051
We don't know.
Maybe somehow he got tipped off

23:39.151 --> 23:40.119
that we were onto him.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.654
His cell phone is powered off.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.355
He hasn't been back
to his apartment,

23:43.456 --> 23:45.357
and his only friends say
they haven't heard from him.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.226
What about the daughter Arlene?

23:47.326 --> 23:48.828
She says she hasn't heard
from him either.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.964
Well, if he's gonna contact
anyone, it's gonna be her.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.300
Go pay her a visit.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.906
(doorbell rings)

24:00.006 --> 24:01.908
Please come in.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.476
Daddy, it's me.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.778
Can you please call me back?
I am worried sick.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.881
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.416
Still no answer,
babe?

24:10.517 --> 24:13.786
No, straight
to voice mail again.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.488
Please tell me
you've heard from him.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.824
Uh, no. That's why we're here.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.493
Well, shouldn't you be out there
searching for him?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.562
Or better yet, the person
who poisoned him?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.964
Well, we-we never said
that someone poisoned him.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.799
We said that he ingested poison.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.668
What's the difference?

24:28.768 --> 24:31.538
I mean, it's not like
he poisoned himself.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.607
You got to be kidding me.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.577
You think my dad is suicidal?
No, no.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.245
Actually, we don't.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.980
So, why would he do
something like that?

24:41.080 --> 24:45.417
Maybe to set your mom up
for attempted murder.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.154
You can't be serious.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.122
So your brilliant theory is that

24:50.222 --> 24:51.958
he did all of this to himself?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.194
Based on what?

24:55.294 --> 24:58.097
Your dad texted
a career criminal.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.732
Told him he'd pay the guy

24:59.832 --> 25:02.034
a couple of grand
to run him over.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.705
ARLENE:
"I'm sick of the pain.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.807
You will be
doing me a favor."

25:07.907 --> 25:09.441
So this guy tried
to kill him?

25:09.542 --> 25:11.043
Yeah, but Felix was able

25:11.143 --> 25:12.845
to jump out of the way
at the last second.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.614
Then he shows up at NCIS

25:14.714 --> 25:16.549
and tries to blame
the whole thing on your mom.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.851
No, my dad did not
write these texts.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.820
Well, they were sent
from his phone.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.556
Maybe so, but they
weren't sent by him.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.793
He doesn't use emojis and
doesn't ever text in shorthand.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.327
Look for yourself.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.597
I have a thousand messages
from my dad,

25:30.697 --> 25:32.531
all written out in
full punctuated sentences,

25:32.632 --> 25:35.334
like old people do.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.073
Look, I get why you think
my dad is capable

25:41.173 --> 25:42.508
of something like this.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.844
He's made a lot
of dumb mistakes.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.046
Like gambling away
your college fund,

25:47.146 --> 25:48.480
then lying about it?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.317
He had a problem,
but he's battled back from it.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.319
He hasn't bet on a game
in a year.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.420
You sure about that?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.589
Yeah. I am.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.991
I'd know firsthand how hard
Felix has worked.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.327
I'm his sponsor
at Gamblers Anonymous.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.495
Yeah, I guess
the old adage is true.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.465
(chuckles) You do
marry your father.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.834
But in our case,

26:07.934 --> 26:09.068
it's the best thing
that could've ever happened.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.871
Vic saw my dad
struggling and

26:11.971 --> 26:14.707
stepped in to help.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.475
I'm really proud
of them both.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.345
Well, uh, you were right.
No emojis.

26:19.445 --> 26:20.680
Then who sent those texts?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.615
We don't know,
but we're gonna find out

26:22.715 --> 26:24.050
and we're gonna find your dad.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.718
In the meantime,
let us know right away

26:25.818 --> 26:27.219
if he calls you,
okay?

26:27.319 --> 26:29.922
I will.
Thank you.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.257
Think she's right?

26:31.357 --> 26:32.725
I think we have
to check it out.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.260
If Felix didn't send those
texts, that means somebody's

26:34.360 --> 26:36.896
been trying to kill him and
make it look like an accident.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.698
And they're probably looking
to finish the job.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.767
Better find Felix first.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.039
You guys are not gonna believe
what I just learned.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.507
Gather around,

26:48.607 --> 26:52.178
for I have an absolute
whopper of a tale. Okay.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.481
Surveillance video
from the hospital parking lot.

26:55.581 --> 26:56.983
There's our boy Felix

26:57.083 --> 26:59.285
getting out of Dodge.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.754
In a taxicab, huh?
Old-school.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.022
TORRES:
Well, taxis accept cash.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.424
Maybe he didn't want
a digital trail.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.826
But I'm guessing
you still tracked him.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.662
That I did. Ran the cab's plate,
found the cabbie,

27:09.762 --> 27:12.865
who told me all about
their long, strange trip.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.600
First,

27:14.701 --> 27:16.302
Felix asked
to be taken to

27:16.402 --> 27:18.604
Spelly's Sporting Goods,
where he bought

27:18.705 --> 27:20.807
baseball cleats
and two batting gloves.

27:20.907 --> 27:23.275
Hmm, okay,
that's totally normal.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.877
Did he tell
the cabbie why?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.279
Nope, but buckle up
because it is about to get

27:27.379 --> 27:29.281
even weirder.
Weirder than

27:29.381 --> 27:31.083
breaking out of the hospital
to go shopping?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.953
Oh, yeah.
So, Felix tells the cabbie

27:34.053 --> 27:35.487
he's paranoid
about being followed,

27:35.587 --> 27:36.989
so he asked to be dropped off

27:37.089 --> 27:41.193
on a dirt road
in the middle of nowhere.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.063
He tell the cabbie why?
KASIE: No.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.099
He just walked off wearing
his new gloves and cleats.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.300
You got to be kidding me.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.635
I-I couldn't make this up.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.037
TORRES:
How do we know that

27:51.137 --> 27:52.671
the cabbie wasn't the one
who just made it up?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.340
Because he has proof.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.008
He thought his friends
weren't gonna believe him,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.544
so he shot a video.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.913
KNIGHT:
There he is.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.716
There he goes.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.753
KNIGHT:
Maybe he loved
Field of Dreams,

28:06.853 --> 28:08.755
and he thought that this
was his big moment.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.790
That's a vineyard,
not a cornfield,

28:10.890 --> 28:14.060
but I get your point.
Felix is nuts.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.895
Hmm, I don't know.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.898
The dude is odd,
but he's not nuts.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.666
I think we're
missing something.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.835
Well, I already checked the map.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.004
Other than an old set
of railroad tracks,

28:25.104 --> 28:27.206
there's nothing
but fields for miles.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.442
What?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.879
Felix is obsessed with trains.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.014
If you're thinking
he hopped a ride,

28:35.114 --> 28:36.482
I already checked.

28:36.582 --> 28:39.051
No commuter trains run
on that line, just freight.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.719
Well, I've hopped
on a few freights

28:40.820 --> 28:42.755
back in my undercover days,

28:42.855 --> 28:44.623
and all you need
is guts...

28:44.723 --> 28:46.625
and gloves...

28:46.725 --> 28:48.327
and shoes with a good grip.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.695
Like cleats?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.798
Where do the tracks go, Kasie?

28:52.598 --> 28:53.632
(typing)

28:53.732 --> 28:56.002
KASIE:
Nothing...

28:56.102 --> 28:57.269
Still nothing...

28:59.772 --> 29:01.107
We got buildings.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.543
Sierra Pelona Motel.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.578
(railroad crossing bell
clanging)

29:10.216 --> 29:12.551
TORRES:
Did we just drive up to 1952?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.954
It's very...
quaint.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.790
Yeah. You got
all the modern amenities.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.291
Look, we even got a phone booth.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.828
("Legends Don't Die"
by Nineoneone playing)

29:27.066 --> 29:30.636
* I got some gasoline,
you got some fire... *

29:30.736 --> 29:32.271
(door closes)

29:32.371 --> 29:33.505
You got a reservation?

29:33.605 --> 29:34.907
No, we're looking for a...

29:35.007 --> 29:36.508
Can't help you if you
don't got a reservation.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.944
We're all booked up.

29:38.744 --> 29:40.246
(music shuts off)

29:40.346 --> 29:41.513
You didn't let me finish.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.982
TORRES:
Damn.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.051
I think you really
pissed her off, bro.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.254
This guy staying
at the motel?

29:48.354 --> 29:51.657
No clue. I just started my
shift, so I don't know anything.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.692
Do you have
a guest list?

29:58.831 --> 30:00.032
So, what did
this dude do?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.701
He killed seven
motel workers.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.337
All desk clerks.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.408
We're gonna need a key
to Room 2.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.111
Felix is using
an alias.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.148
John Stevens-- who's that?

30:16.248 --> 30:18.250
Father of the
American railroad.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.518
How do you know that?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.520
Studied it in school.
Nerd.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.821
(chuckles)

30:22.922 --> 30:24.423
You really think it's Felix?

30:24.523 --> 30:25.791
I think if it isn't,

30:25.892 --> 30:27.493
whoever's in Room 2
is gonna be pissed.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.096
(knocks on door)

30:30.196 --> 30:32.398
Mr. Stevens,
federal agents.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.502
Open up, or we're coming in.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.705
(unlocking door)

30:39.805 --> 30:41.040
Hello?

30:41.140 --> 30:43.675
NCIS.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.677
Felix, you in here?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.420
I got blood.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.759
Clear.
Clear here, too.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.632
KNIGHT:
You got something?

31:06.732 --> 31:10.903
Yeah. Felix's hospital band.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.438
I guess we found him.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.705
Well, looks like whoever

31:13.805 --> 31:15.307
was trying to kill him
found him first.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.119
Thanks, Sheriff.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.021
Arlington County
has a BOLO out

31:29.121 --> 31:30.489
on Felix.
Still no hits.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.058
TORRES:
Yeah, we struck out, too.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.961
None of the guests from
the motel saw or heard anything.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.395
What about security cameras?

31:36.495 --> 31:38.697
No way. The hotel doesn't
even have an ice machine.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.399
So we still don't know if Felix

31:40.499 --> 31:42.334
walked out
or left in a body bag.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.769
And the blood in the room?

31:43.869 --> 31:45.204
KNIGHT:
Kasie's analyzing that now.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.405
You found blood?

31:47.306 --> 31:49.175
Is it my husband's?

31:49.275 --> 31:50.943
Madam Secretary,
we weren't, uh...

31:51.043 --> 31:52.078
I asked you a question.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.645
Is it Felix's blood?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.814
We don't know.
We're working on it.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.383
Really?

31:57.483 --> 31:58.650
Because it doesn't look to me
like you're doing anything

31:58.750 --> 32:00.219
but standing around, chatting.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.653
We understand
that you're frustrated.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.922
Frustrated? No, I'm pissed off.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.291
Where is my husband?

32:05.391 --> 32:06.625
We don't know.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.726
Is he alive?

32:07.826 --> 32:08.927
We don't know.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.396
Well, what do you know?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.999
We'll find answers,
but we need more time.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.934
FLYNN:
Well, Agent Parker, I'm not
sure Felix has any more time.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.304
So, if he's dead,
there's blood on all your hands.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.905
Madam Secretary.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.707
I need a word.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.542
Now.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.019
Here. Have a seat.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.964
I know what you're going to say.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.433
I overstepped.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.767
I shouldn't be here.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.269
No. You shouldn't.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.438
I showed up unannounced
because I knew if I called,

32:52.538 --> 32:54.073
you wouldn't let me in
through the gate.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.576
Actually, ma'am, I don't have
the authority to stop you,

32:57.676 --> 32:59.645
but I would've tried.

32:59.745 --> 33:03.049
I couldn't sit there worrying
a second longer.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.784
And you thought coming in
like a bull in a china shop

33:05.884 --> 33:06.852
was the best move?

33:06.952 --> 33:08.820
I didn't think.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.257
I reacted.

33:12.391 --> 33:16.295
Do you ever wonder how Felix
and I ended up together, Leon?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.130
It crossed my mind.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.399
We met freshman year at Amherst.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.969
He was everything
I was not--

33:24.070 --> 33:25.837
spontaneous,

33:25.937 --> 33:27.306
funny,

33:27.406 --> 33:28.707
artistic.

33:28.807 --> 33:29.808
Best of all,

33:29.908 --> 33:32.311
my dad hated him.
(laughing)

33:34.480 --> 33:36.982
We got married
right after graduation,

33:37.083 --> 33:40.252
and I soon discovered

33:40.352 --> 33:42.721
his unique brilliance

33:42.821 --> 33:44.756
didn't translate
to the real world.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.025
But by then,
I was in law school,

33:47.126 --> 33:48.560
I was pregnant
with Arlene.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.462
No matter what,

33:50.562 --> 33:53.965
he's a wonderful dad
to our daughter.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.667
She needs him back.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.637
Then you need to let my agents
do what they do best.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.707
You need to trust them,
Tara, not berate them.

34:01.807 --> 34:02.908
I know.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.777
Find my husband, Leon.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.180
Bring him back to me.
We will.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.749
And then you bring me
the bastard who did this.

34:10.849 --> 34:11.917
We will.

34:12.017 --> 34:14.320
But the best thing
you can do now

34:14.420 --> 34:15.921
is go home.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.259
(phone rings)

34:20.359 --> 34:22.494
(exhales)

34:23.895 --> 34:25.063
Actually...

34:26.165 --> 34:28.600
...change of plans.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.736
(elevator bell dings)

34:32.338 --> 34:33.672
(elevator bell dings)

34:34.440 --> 34:37.376
Secretary Flynn,
sign here, please.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.811
What is this?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.381
Maybe explain, Ms. Hines?
Yes, of course.

34:42.481 --> 34:46.218
I just tested the blood
from your husband's hotel room.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.487
Is it Felix's?
I don't know.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.656
The hospital won't release
his medical records

34:50.756 --> 34:53.459
because of HIPAA laws.
I could apply for a warrant,

34:53.559 --> 34:54.793
which will take
a few days...

34:54.893 --> 34:56.462
Or his wife could sign a release

34:56.562 --> 34:59.097
and get the records immediately.
Pen, please.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.500
Once I get Felix's records,
I'll know if the blood

35:01.600 --> 35:04.136
from the hotel room
is his.
Thank you.

35:12.411 --> 35:15.614
Felix is dead, isn't he, Leon?

35:18.717 --> 35:21.153
He's already survived
four attempts on his life.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.989
If anyone could have gotten
out of that room alive,

35:24.089 --> 35:25.123
it's him.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.993
You know what's crazy?

35:28.093 --> 35:29.528
For the last year,

35:29.628 --> 35:31.430
all I wanted was
for him to go away.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.266
Now all I want is
to see him again.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.302
I understand
that feeling.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.769
I do want to thank you

35:37.869 --> 35:40.005
for everything you and
your team have done.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.907
We're not done yet.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.776
Felix's records
just came in.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.546
The blood from the hotel room
is not his.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.148
Oh, thank God.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.583
Whose is it?

35:51.683 --> 35:54.453
Unknown. It's not a match
for anyone in our system.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.188
So that's it, then?
Is the blood a dead end?

35:56.288 --> 35:59.658
Not quite. The blood
is a super rare type,

35:59.758 --> 36:01.460
AB negative, which only occurs

36:01.560 --> 36:04.830
in less than one percent
of the population.

36:04.930 --> 36:05.831
Tara?

36:05.931 --> 36:09.968
AB negative? Are you sure?

36:10.068 --> 36:11.903
Why?
Last year

36:12.003 --> 36:13.539
my uncle needed
a transfusion,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.574
so I organized
a family blood drive.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.943
And one of them
was AB negative?

36:18.043 --> 36:20.011
(doorbell rings)

36:20.111 --> 36:23.114
(sportscaster speaking
indistinctly on TV)

36:23.215 --> 36:24.316
Oh, no.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.551
Arlene, may we come in?

36:25.651 --> 36:26.885
Did you find my dad?

36:26.985 --> 36:29.788
No, but we know who
found him yesterday.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.257
Who?

36:31.357 --> 36:32.691
SPORTSCASTER: And we thought
it was gonna be a victory

36:32.791 --> 36:34.593
but not this big.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.194
And there's the face-off.
Up the left...

36:36.295 --> 36:37.763
(mutes TV)

36:38.897 --> 36:41.132
Ah, you're a big fan of, uh,

36:41.233 --> 36:42.768
Bakersfield Condors

36:42.868 --> 36:44.202
ice hockey, Victor?

36:44.303 --> 36:45.871
Maybe you got a little
money riding on the game?

36:45.971 --> 36:48.340
I'm in Gamblers Anonymous,
remember?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.642
Right. Felix's sponsor.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.612
Which makes you
the worst sponsor in history.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.314
What are you talking about?

36:55.414 --> 36:58.317
You're betting again,
and you are in big-time debt

36:58.417 --> 36:59.385
to the wrong guy.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.719
McGEE:
Olev the bookie.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.288
We had a little
conversation with him.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.823
He told us that you're into him
for 50 grand.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.259
What?
Vic, is this true?

37:07.359 --> 37:09.328
Olev's lying.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.729
I haven't made a bet in years.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.332
Really? Because he just
installed cameras

37:13.432 --> 37:15.301
at his casino, and you're
the star of the show.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.636
Honey, I can ex...
Shut up.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.907
What does this have to do
with my dad?

37:22.007 --> 37:24.242
Victor's debt was overdue.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.812
Olev threatened to kill him
if he didn't pay up.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.648
Victor knew that your dad
had an insurance policy,

37:29.748 --> 37:31.049
and you're
the sole beneficiary.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.651
No, I don't
believe it.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.219
No matter how desperate Vic was,

37:34.320 --> 37:36.187
he would never try
to kill my dad.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.723
KNIGHT:
Well, you could
prove it to us

37:37.823 --> 37:39.391
by letting us search you
for injuries.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.026
Whoever tried to kill Felix

37:41.126 --> 37:42.761
left blood all over the hotel.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.230
His left arm.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.632
Oh, yeah?

37:46.732 --> 37:48.700
ARLENE:
You said you

37:48.800 --> 37:50.969
cut your arm doing yard work.

37:54.706 --> 37:55.841
You're under arrest.
Hey.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.309
How did he know my father

37:57.409 --> 37:58.610
was hiding in a hotel room?

37:58.710 --> 38:00.111
VICTOR:
Take it easy, man.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.381
Because your father texted him
from a burn phone.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.215
"Victor. Tell Arlene I'm safe

38:04.316 --> 38:07.118
and laying low
at the Sierra Pelona Motel."

38:09.955 --> 38:11.990
ARLENE:
My dad trusted you.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.327
And you tried to kill him?

38:17.195 --> 38:19.331
Say something!

38:21.132 --> 38:22.634
I want a lawyer.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.339
(dialing)

38:29.207 --> 38:30.376
Felix.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.310
Special Agent McGee here.

38:32.411 --> 38:36.147
Good, I got someone here
that wants to talk to you. Yeah.

38:37.383 --> 38:38.384
Daddy?

38:38.484 --> 38:39.951
Daddy, hi.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.688
(crying):
Yeah, you can come home now.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.894
TORRES:
Victor knows he's screwed

38:48.994 --> 38:51.229
because he just owned up
to everything.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.899
KNIGHT:
First he cut the brake line
to Felix's truck,

38:53.999 --> 38:56.034
and then he tried to sabotage
his water heater.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.136
And when that failed,
he sent those

38:58.236 --> 39:00.972
"Please run me over" texts
from Felix's cell.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.508
What about
the poison?

39:02.608 --> 39:04.009
Purchased from the black market.

39:04.109 --> 39:07.012
I can't believe my son-in-law
is such a monster.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.081
That makes two of us.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.753
Sorry we're late.
Felix had a hankering for a...

39:14.853 --> 39:17.188
Diet peach kombucha.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.125
Well, I guess you earned it.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.494
It's really good
to see you, Tara.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.195
I'm so glad you're okay.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.897
Yeah, well, me, too.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.566
FLYNN:
Oh, my God, your neck.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.200
Did Victor do that to you?

39:29.300 --> 39:31.537
Yeah, when he attacked me
at the motel,

39:31.637 --> 39:34.339
but I used the, uh, Swiss Army
knife that you gave me

39:34.440 --> 39:35.741
to slice open
his arm.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.175
Felix, why didn't you
tell anyone

39:37.275 --> 39:38.877
that it was Victor
who attacked you?

39:38.977 --> 39:41.747
Because I didn't know.
He was wearing a mask.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.583
How's Arlene doing?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.217
Better than I would be.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.586
But I know one thing,

39:47.686 --> 39:49.455
she's going to need
both of us to get through this.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.390
So we need to bury
the hatchet right now.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.293
Well, let me go first.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.730
I'm so sorry,
just for everything.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.166
Me, too.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.469
And I hope we can be friends.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.404
(chuckles) I'd like that.
Oh...

40:09.040 --> 40:11.743
Now I've seen it all.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.549
Torres, are you crying?
No.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.284
Can I just,
can I just...?

40:19.384 --> 40:21.520
I just have to get
one thing off my chest.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.790
That Lionel train set
that you destroyed

40:24.890 --> 40:26.224
was a 1976

40:26.324 --> 40:28.927
standard gauge
that I meticulously rebuilt...

40:29.027 --> 40:30.496
Felix, you accused me of murder.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.063
FELIX:
See, you turn it around,

40:32.163 --> 40:34.065
you make it about you.
FLYNN: 'Cause it is about me.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.534
FELIX:
Well, I'm talking
about a train set

40:35.634 --> 40:37.335
that I had to fly...
Uh, hello, I had to fly there

40:37.435 --> 40:40.038
to get it. (stammers)
You can't get it anyplace else.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.406
I had to go get it myself.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.609
And that's why
I'm never getting married.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.677
Okay.
