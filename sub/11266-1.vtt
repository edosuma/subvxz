WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210:

00:03.211 --> 00:04.546
I told my mom that
I stole the coins.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.173
You did?
Yeah.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.716
And, uh, when my stepdad
gets back from Miami,

00:07.842 --> 00:08.634
I'm gonna
tell him, too.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.593
We're going to Australia.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.679
I'm so stoked!

00:11.804 --> 00:14.473
If you think that you can
play tennis and be with me,

00:14.598 --> 00:15.641
then it's your decision.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.601
Surprise.
(chuckles)

00:17.726 --> 00:19.687
I'm gonna be a father.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.564
My baby doesn't need a public
schoolteacher as a father.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.693
I want you to open
for me on tour.
What?

00:25.818 --> 00:27.110
And we'll get to
travel together...

00:27.235 --> 00:28.320
Stop.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.697
I got back together
with Navid.

00:29.822 --> 00:30.781
ANNIE:
I was the one

00:30.906 --> 00:34.159
who killed Joe Herman.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.495
I was coming down Mulholland

00:36.620 --> 00:38.038
when I hit something,
and I just panicked.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.499
We don't have
anything!

00:40.624 --> 00:42.459
You don't have a job,

00:42.584 --> 00:44.378
we don't have savings, and we
don't love each other anymore!

00:50.759 --> 00:51.719
I see the way you look at me.

00:51.844 --> 00:52.803
And your whole
harassment fantasy?

00:52.928 --> 00:54.555
You're trying to provoke me.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.390
Get away from
me, you perv!

00:56.515 --> 00:58.308
(grunts) Stop it!
Stop or I will tell!

00:58.433 --> 00:59.852
Stop!

00:59.977 --> 01:01.311
Who you gonna tell?
Who you gonna tell?

01:07.693 --> 01:09.319
CHEERLEADERS (chanting):
Freshmen, freshmen,

01:09.444 --> 01:12.239
welcome here, watch out
for seniors, live in fear!

01:12.364 --> 01:14.783
Oh, yeah! Senior
year, baby!

01:14.909 --> 01:16.577
(laughs)

01:18.829 --> 01:21.373
Okay, how much longer are
you gonna keep saying that?

01:21.498 --> 01:22.833
I don't know,
maybe when it's not

01:22.958 --> 01:24.919
senior year, baby!
(laughs)

01:25.044 --> 01:27.379
I cannot believe
that you two are seniors.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.422
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.506
You promised,
no tears.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.632
What? No, these?

01:30.758 --> 01:31.759
These are allergies.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.635
And what are you
allergic to, Mom?

01:33.761 --> 01:34.720
Senior year.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.431
(all laugh)

01:42.477 --> 01:44.354
Bouillabaisse.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.731
What?

01:45.856 --> 01:47.232
For our annual
back-to-school dinner.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.567
I've been going
back and forth,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.694
trying to figure out what to
make, but if I do bouillabaisse,

01:50.819 --> 01:52.279
I can put a little bit
of everything in.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.864
Mom, we don't
have to do a whole...

01:53.989 --> 01:55.365
No, why wouldn't we?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.366
Bouillabaisse it is.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.743
All right.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.413
You guys have fun today, because
it is senior year, babies!

02:02.539 --> 02:04.207
Think she's gonna be okay?

02:04.332 --> 02:05.459
NAVID:
Oh, yeah!

02:05.584 --> 02:08.294
Senior year, baby!

02:08.419 --> 02:09.295
(laughs)

02:09.420 --> 02:10.380
Officially done
with house arrest?

02:10.505 --> 02:11.715
Mm-hmm.
Good.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.341
I'm glad.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.510
You can finally put
the hit-and-run behind you.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.721
Yeah, I'm just
on probation till I'm 25,

02:17.846 --> 02:19.890
but other than that, things
go totally back to normal.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.266
Yeah, normal's good.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.267
Normal is great.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.269
Normal is all
that I want this year.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.896
Happy first last day
of school!

02:26.021 --> 02:26.897
(whooping, laughter)

02:27.022 --> 02:27.898
We're seniors!
Yes, sir.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.274
You guys know
what that means?

02:29.399 --> 02:30.651
That's right, we get
to torture freshmen?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.402
We got to make
this year count.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Exactly.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.155
Which is why
I spent all summer

02:35.280 --> 02:37.032
working on my senior
project application.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.742
If I make a kick-ass
documentary,

02:38.867 --> 02:40.535
it's gonna help me get into
a kick-ass film school,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.370
which means I need
a kick-ass advisor.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.580
And a kick-ass subject.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.665
Why not document
a charismatic

02:44.790 --> 02:46.500
tennis star
on the cusp of glory?

02:46.625 --> 02:47.918
Know one?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.503
DIXON:
Hey, seriously, bro.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.671
What's your chances
of going pro?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.589
Well, depends on
how I play this year.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.715
I mean,
every tournament counts.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.549
Talk about pressure.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.175
Uh, no.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.886
Pressure is a Persian father
at college application time.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.346
(laughter)

02:59.471 --> 03:00.472
Another tweet
from Naomi.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.932
She's at the airport,
and the customs guy

03:02.057 --> 03:03.642
is giving her
a hard time.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.352
Summer in the
Riviera, man?

03:05.477 --> 03:06.645
Naomi's so lucky.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.397
I know. She just bribed
customs guy with a Birkin bag.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.482
(laughter)

03:16.071 --> 03:17.698
(knocking)

03:25.497 --> 03:26.707
Hi, Larry.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.877
One more week, please?

03:30.002 --> 03:31.128
You've been staying
here for three months.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.047
And my trust fund kicks in
in one more week.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.009
How's your wife
like the Birkin bag?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.927
She says it's worthless without

03:39.053 --> 03:40.846
shoes to match.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.852
Well, can you hurry up?
It's been 92 days,

03:46.977 --> 03:49.604
seven hours and six minutes
since I've last seen you.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.356
IVY:
Dixon, it honestly killed me

03:51.481 --> 03:53.274
when you had to leave Australia.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.693
Look, I-I'm sorry, all right?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.111
But I had to go.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.946
I had no choice.
My parents were splitting up.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.614
Hey! I see you! Turn around.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.121
Hey, I know you stole it,
Gidget.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.998
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get off of me!

04:08.123 --> 04:09.416
And please stop calling me that!

04:09.541 --> 04:10.667
Well, then what's this?
Wh... oh.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.169
Look at that.
What have we here?

04:12.293 --> 04:13.045
Whatever. You
shouldn't have guzzled

04:13.170 --> 04:13.921
my orange juice
this morning.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.380
(laughs)

04:20.719 --> 04:22.554
You must be Dixon.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.723
Let me just say, you're even
more adorable in person.

04:24.848 --> 04:25.849
Dixon, meet Oscar.

04:25.974 --> 04:26.850
Yes, the Oscar.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.018
What Oscar?

04:28.143 --> 04:29.436
Did you not tell him, Gidget?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.105
Well, I'm trying to.
And seriously,

04:31.230 --> 04:32.397
enough with this
Gidget thing.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.356
(stutters, chuckles)

04:33.481 --> 04:34.858
Tell him what?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.568
Oscar is the son of
an old family friend.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.778
We've known each other
since we were kids.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.029
And as I recall,

04:39.154 --> 04:40.614
Ivy ran around
in her knickers

04:40.739 --> 04:41.823
long after it
was appropriate.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.867
Shut up.
Anyways,

04:43.992 --> 04:45.035
he's been staying with us
over the summer,

04:45.160 --> 04:46.286
interning at the record label.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.122
And I've just decided
to stay the year.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.456
IVY: And I just
found this out

04:49.581 --> 04:50.457
upon getting in last night.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.042
You know, it's
practical, really.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.543
See, I graduated
last year

04:53.668 --> 04:55.003
with rather
mediocre marks,

04:55.129 --> 04:56.964
which means I can't
get into any university

04:57.089 --> 04:58.132
worth the price
of admission.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.424
But it's nothing a
good old-fashioned

04:59.549 --> 05:00.508
PG year can't fix.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.718
PG?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.011
Uh, postgrad.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.847
Oh. Okay, so, um,
so where will you be staying

05:05.973 --> 05:07.057
for this, uh, PG year?

05:07.182 --> 05:09.059
With Laurel and Ivy of course.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.103
I know.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.940
(Navid laughs,
makes kissing noises)

05:18.401 --> 05:21.071
Okay, I was just, uh, caught
making out with my cell phone.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.907
Not how I imagined
starting my senior year.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.408
Of course, the fact
that a soon-to-be

05:25.533 --> 05:27.077
international pop star
is on the other end

05:27.202 --> 05:28.829
might up my street cred
a little.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.497
ADRIANNA: Well, this soon-to-be
international pop star

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
wishes she
was with you.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.500
Then come back to school.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.085
(chuckles)
How about
you hang up the phone.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.711
What did Javier say?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.588
Nothing.

05:38.713 --> 05:39.923
I'll talk to you later,
okay, baby?

05:40.048 --> 05:41.633
Okay, bye.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.509
(makes kissing noises)

05:45.804 --> 05:47.681
Oh, eyelash.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.849
Make a wish.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.391
I wish you would stop

05:50.517 --> 05:52.019
making things so uncomfortable.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.145
I wish you would
accept the fact

05:53.270 --> 05:54.104
that Navid is
my boyfriend.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.981
That's two.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.900
Things have to change, Javier,
I'm serious.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.945
They will.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
Because I'm dropping you
from the tour.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.823
What?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.325
I'm not about to keep you afloat

06:06.449 --> 06:08.118
now that we're back in L.A.
and you're throwing Navid

06:08.243 --> 06:09.703
in my face.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.163
Look at the bright side.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.456
You can go back
to high school.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.458
Maybe even join glee club.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.090
Hey, Liam.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.717
Screw you.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.137
Bonjour mon amie!
Oh!

06:27.262 --> 06:28.555
You made it
through customs!

06:28.680 --> 06:30.140
Just barely.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.100
Oh, how it killed me
to leave the Riviera.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.895
Ooh, remind me to tell you about
my liaison with Rob Pattinson.

06:35.020 --> 06:35.979
Oh, yeah, he bites.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.480
(both chuckle)

06:37.605 --> 06:38.732
So who do you have
for homeroom?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.775
Mr. Cannon.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.361
That's impossible.
He's in London.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.238
He was only teaching
at West Bev for the year.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.573
I know, I thought so, too,
but he's on my schedule.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.616
No, but it has to be
a mistake.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.910
Apparently not.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.078
Better beat
him to class.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.037
I'll see you
at lunch.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.419
(rumbling, people screaming)

07:01.963 --> 07:03.464
CANNON: Over here.
(Naomi screams)

07:12.682 --> 07:13.558
(groans)

07:13.683 --> 07:14.559
SILVER:
Are you okay?!

07:14.684 --> 07:15.852
Yeah.
(groans)

07:21.900 --> 07:23.277
(screaming)

07:25.987 --> 07:27.614
(screaming)

07:29.074 --> 07:31.159
(muffled screaming)

07:33.370 --> 07:34.871
(screaming)
Naomi, it's okay!

07:34.996 --> 07:36.748
It's just an earthquake.
It's just an earthquake.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.750
(gasping)

07:41.169 --> 07:42.212
You look good, Naomi.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.881
Don't look at me like that.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.674
Like what?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.011
You...

07:50.137 --> 07:50.887
Careful.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.724
Don't go spreading lies again.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.689
I look forward to seeing
you around school.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.235
Okay, guys!

08:05.360 --> 08:06.778
Okay, calm down.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.988
I know that was
a little frightening.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.739
We're gonna evacuate
the building this way.

08:09.864 --> 08:10.865
Come on.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.169
Hello.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.129
I'd like to report a rape.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.649
All right, guys, be careful.
Watch your step.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.109
There's broken glass here.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.235
IVY: God, I can't believe
we're stuck in school.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.612
The waves would be
sick after this quake.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.490
Then why not go
to the beach?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
Because ditching
isn't exactly a good way

08:53.700 --> 08:55.118
to start off the school year.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.703
Who said anything
about being good?

08:56.828 --> 08:59.122
Look, some of us don't
want to have to do

08:59.247 --> 09:00.123
a PG year.
(laughs)

09:00.248 --> 09:01.082
Touché, brother Dixon.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.876
Touché.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.754
You know,

09:06.880 --> 09:07.881
someone's gonna come eventually.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.844
Look, Liam,
I get why you're mad.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.847
And it's not that I didn't want
to talk to you this summer,

09:15.972 --> 09:19.684
I-I was just
overwhelmed with lawyers

09:19.809 --> 09:20.685
and probation.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.811
You couldn't find five minutes?

09:21.936 --> 09:25.190
I left you that message
saying that I hoped

09:25.315 --> 09:27.150
everything went okay.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.529
So... did it go okay?

09:30.653 --> 09:32.864
Well, that depends on
how you define "okay."

09:32.989 --> 09:34.157
What happened?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.869
Liam, please.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.996
(sighs)

09:40.121 --> 09:42.874
I told my stepfather I stole
the coins, and he kicked me out.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.959
And Jasper lit my boat on fire.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.253
What?!

09:48.004 --> 09:50.006
(sighs)

09:50.131 --> 09:51.550
I had no idea.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.428
Well, that's right, 'cause
you didn't return my calls.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.389
I'm so sorry.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.599
I should have
been there for you.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.687
(door opens)

10:05.439 --> 10:06.731
You guys okay?

10:06.856 --> 10:07.899
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.900
CANNON:
Good.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.444
Come on.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.782
Okay, thanks.
I appreciate that.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.409
You get through
to the doctor?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.953
Yep. He'll check my knee out
this afternoon.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.746
I'm sure it's fine;
I'll be able to play.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.997
MAN (over bullhorn):
Attention everyone!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.374
Attention!

10:24.499 --> 10:26.918
In light of the earthquake,
West Beverly

10:27.043 --> 10:29.254
has to be inspected
for structural damage,

10:30.838 --> 10:32.090
so school is dismissed
for the day.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.218
(cheering)

10:35.343 --> 10:36.970
Wait, what?
Who even was that guy?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.764
No, Navid,

10:39.889 --> 10:41.099
don't go.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.268
Okay. Don't high-five me.
Don't high-five me.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.769
DIXON:
Okay, so, look,

10:44.894 --> 10:46.396
I want to take you
somewhere special.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.981
School's canceled party!

10:48.106 --> 10:48.982
My house.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.233
Right on.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.360
JOANNA: School's
canceled party, my house!

10:52.486 --> 10:55.196
Don't I get a thank you?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.990
Got school dismissed.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.283
What? You?!

10:58.408 --> 10:59.867
Now you can go surfing.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.035
Forgive me
for the OJ debacle?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.203
Ah, hell yeah!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.955
Oscar, you-you rock!

11:04.080 --> 11:05.290
Are you kidding?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.292
I can't believe you
dressed up like a fireman

11:07.417 --> 11:08.918
and got us
out of school.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.128
Genius!

11:10.253 --> 11:12.130
(both laughing)

11:12.255 --> 11:13.672
(engine starting)

11:16.926 --> 11:20.013
Guys, hold it.
No, guys, the school's... No.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.223
Ah, great.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.142
Hey, Annie,
uh, I hear

11:24.267 --> 11:25.977
you're the envy
of the school.
Hmm?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.438
Because you got me
as a senior advisor.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.191
Ah, yes, I mean, I just haven't
told many people

11:31.316 --> 11:32.400
because I don't want
to flaunt it.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.152
Ah, that's a good strategy.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.488
Mmm.
So did you get
my e-mail

11:36.613 --> 11:37.947
about the internship
at the Abbott Playhouse?

11:38.072 --> 11:41.117
Yeah, and I'm
not gonna apply.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.910
I'll never get it.

11:43.036 --> 11:43.995
What are you talking about?
I mean,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.121
I write
one helluva recommendation.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.498
You know my secret weapon?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.083
Lots of big words,
like "assiduous."

11:49.209 --> 11:50.502
Mmm. Come on.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.462
I mean, the moment
they ask what I did

11:52.587 --> 11:54.005
this summer,
it's all gonna fall apart.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.256
Saying that I...
I was on house arrest

11:55.382 --> 11:56.841
for a hit-and-run

11:56.966 --> 11:59.344
doesn't exactly scream
"qualified candidate."

11:59.469 --> 12:00.428
Well, your records are sealed.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.846
They don't need to know.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.264
Look, give
yourself a break.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.349
You paid your dues.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.476
Now you deserve a chance.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.897
So, you'll write that
recommendation letter?

12:11.022 --> 12:12.273
It's already written.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.733
I can be
pretty assiduous myself.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.820
Now you better hurry up.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.280
That interview's at 11:00.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.198
Thank you,
Mr. Matthews.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.616
You got it.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.374
Hey, Jen, it's me, uh, again.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.293
Look, I deserve a chance.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.503
I mean, there was
just an earthquake,

12:33.628 --> 12:35.004
and I don't know if you're okay,

12:35.129 --> 12:36.506
and you're carrying my child.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.426
And, uh, just call me back,
okay?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.135
Or I'm gonna get a lawyer.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.930
Later.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.349
Hey, Navid, wait!

12:46.474 --> 12:48.309
Oh, Liam, wait, wait!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.395
I know I am

12:50.520 --> 12:52.313
probably the last person
in the world that you want

12:52.439 --> 12:54.649
to help right now, but my
license is still suspended,

12:54.773 --> 12:57.151
and I have to get downtown
because there's this

12:57.277 --> 12:59.153
amazing internship,
and I can't find Dixon anywhere.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.202
(Liam sighs)

13:08.204 --> 13:09.372
Thank you.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.624
Thank you. Thank you.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.835
I don't know why
I'm doing this.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.384
IVY:
Aw, this sucks.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.428
It's totally flat.
I guess the earthquake

13:23.553 --> 13:25.138
just wasn't
big enough.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.140
It's okay.
We'll just go
somewhere else.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.435
Anyone interested in
taking some Jet Skis
for a spin?

13:30.560 --> 13:33.104
We don't have
Jet Skis.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.564
Astute as ever,
Dixon-- we don't,

13:34.689 --> 13:36.149
in fact, have
Jet Skis.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.317
However, they do.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.238
You want to steal Jet Skis?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.073
Of course not.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.659
I want to borrow Jet Skis.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.327
We'll leave a couple
of quid for gas.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.995
Unless you two are scared?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.913
Just scared that
I might embarrass

13:51.038 --> 13:52.332
you out there.
Oh-ho-ho.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.382
Lights are out
because of the quake.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.135
I'm so sorry.
I wish your last limo ride

14:04.260 --> 14:05.345
was a little
less chaotic.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.305
Uh! You've made your point,
Javier, okay?

14:07.430 --> 14:08.473
I'm not touring with you.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.557
Doesn't mean my
career is over.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.225
Laurel still believes in me.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.352
Believed.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.478
Oh!
There's a new girl

14:13.603 --> 14:15.104
the label's throwing
their weight behind.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.148
Dominique? I'm sure
you've heard of her.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.567
She's similar to you,
but younger, taller, tanner.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.110
Huh. Is that all?

14:21.235 --> 14:23.655
No, she's also thinner.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.156
They're giving her
all their good songs.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.116
So what? I'll write my own.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.368
(scoffs)

14:28.493 --> 14:29.994
This is ridiculous.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.621
Could you please just
move around them?

14:31.746 --> 14:34.207
DRIVER:
Yes, sir.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.502
(chuckles)

14:37.627 --> 14:38.628
You'll write
your own songs?
Mm-hmm.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.130
(chuckles)
Please, Adrianna,

14:41.255 --> 14:43.049
the duet you wrote
is the only song

14:43.174 --> 14:44.467
I've performed that hasn't
cracked the Top 20.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.260
See this?
Mm-hmm.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.472
There's ten songs in here
that are gonna be huge hits.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.057
You don't have the gift.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.559
(tires screeching)
So if I were you, I would...

15:22.672 --> 15:24.048
(growls playfully)

15:24.173 --> 15:25.091
(both laugh)

15:25.216 --> 15:26.467
Hi.

15:26.593 --> 15:30.263
Hey, what do you say we
get rid of Austin Powers here

15:30.388 --> 15:31.305
and go somewhere
alone, huh?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.766
I wish.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.141
But I have to buy
him a burger

15:34.267 --> 15:36.686
'cause he beat me
to the buoy.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.022
What's wrong with you?

15:40.147 --> 15:42.734
Nothing. I...

15:42.859 --> 15:45.194
Look, I just don't like the way
he looks at you, okay?

15:45.319 --> 15:46.654
(chuckles)

15:46.780 --> 15:48.698
Like, he's seen you
in your knickers.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.618
We were five.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.494
They were Gremlin underoos.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.579
You're totally overreacting.

15:54.704 --> 15:55.580
He's living at your house.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.581
Yeah, so?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.458
Don't you trust me?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.376
That depends.
Are you gonna be squealing

16:00.501 --> 16:02.253
every time he wants
to steal a Jet Ski?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.338
Okay, one: I don't squeal,
and two: I don't understand why

16:04.464 --> 16:06.173
you're acting like some jealous
freak for no reason here.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.217
(vehicle approaches)
Look, maybe if you just...

16:10.261 --> 16:12.346
Oh, don't worry.
Me and my girlfriend

16:12.472 --> 16:13.640
have had some spectacular rows.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.558
Trust me, I get it.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.310
Let me give you two
some time alone.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.270
What? No.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.231
No. I... I owe you a burger,
I'm gonna buy you a burger.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.733
Ivy...

16:30.740 --> 16:32.492
Oh, I'm so glad the
doctor cleared him.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.827
He's playing great.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.703
Whoo! Come on Teddy!

16:35.829 --> 16:38.498
I don't understand
what's keeping Adrianna.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.500
SILVER:
Well, the roads are a mess.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.251
Oh! Whoo!

16:42.376 --> 16:44.044
Ace him!

16:44.879 --> 16:46.213
He's not serving.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.715
You can only ace someone
when you're serving.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.551
Let's just be grateful I'm
using tennis terminology.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.345
When we first started dating,
I told him to serve a no-hitter.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.306
Adrianna's not picking up
her phone now.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.223
Match point.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.362
Whoo! All right, baby!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.490
(groaning)

17:12.615 --> 17:14.032
What is it?

17:18.204 --> 17:21.624
(groaning)

17:24.084 --> 17:27.253
So I spent
most of the summer holed up

17:27.380 --> 17:29.632
watching movies,

17:29.757 --> 17:32.426
just trying to forget.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.428
I really thought
I could

17:34.554 --> 17:36.222
since I wasn't gonna him again,

17:36.347 --> 17:38.474
but now that I am, I...

17:38.599 --> 17:40.727
I can't. I just can't.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.102
You didn't get a rape kit?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.523
Did you tell anyone
what happened?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.316
No!

17:47.441 --> 17:50.277
It was...

17:50.403 --> 17:52.071
it was humiliating.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.618
I felt ashamed...

17:57.744 --> 17:59.286
like I deserved it.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.581
Naomi, listen to me,
you did not deserve it.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.249
You didn't ask for it
and you didn't provoke it.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.375
Yes, I did.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.835
Last year,

18:05.960 --> 18:09.129
I accused this guy
of sexual harassment.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.674
And I made it up.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.217
Which is another reason

18:13.342 --> 18:15.094
why I didn't feel like
I could come forward.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.681
Does this mean
I don't have a case?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.683
No. I think you should
still press charges.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.976
You're just gonna have

18:22.101 --> 18:23.853
to prepare yourself
for a very messy trial.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.897
His attorneys will
try to attack you,

18:26.022 --> 18:27.314
they'll drag you
through the mud.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.691
And if I don't want
to go through all of that,

18:28.816 --> 18:30.150
then what?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.485
He just gets to go on

18:31.611 --> 18:32.737
and live the rest of his life

18:32.862 --> 18:34.280
while I'm left like this?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.532
I can't sleep.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.493
When I'm talking to people,
it's like I'm not even there.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.371
It's like I'm watching this
person who looks like me

18:42.496 --> 18:44.540
and sounds like me,
but it's not me anymore.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.166
It's this stranger
who doesn't want anyone

18:46.292 --> 18:47.877
to touch her or look at her.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.796
Let me refer you
to a counseling service.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.213
It may help

18:51.338 --> 18:52.465
for you to talk about it.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.341
I don't want to talk about it.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.636
I don't want to go through
a whole trial

18:56.761 --> 18:58.805
just to end up
in the same place but worse

18:58.930 --> 19:00.765
because then everyone will know
and they'll think

19:00.890 --> 19:01.891
I'm some lying sociopath.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.434
No! God, this was a bad idea.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.560
Wait.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.065
If there's anything I can do...

19:09.189 --> 19:12.151
Can you turn me back into the
person I was before that night?

19:13.945 --> 19:16.614
Because that's all I want.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.202
MAN:
Just breathe.
Breathe.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.455
I need to put
a brace on it.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.999
Come on, Ade, pick up.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.586
MAN (over radio):
We have an 11-44.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.630
Dead on arrival.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.187
I can't believe
Javier's dead.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.440
Miss, is there someone
you can call?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.402
To pick you up?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.574
Uh, yeah, my boyfriend.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.621
Oh, wait, this isn't...

20:05.746 --> 20:07.790
Hmm?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
Nothing. Forget it.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.563
Thank you so much for bringing
these dresses.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.565
I knew I wouldn't have time
to swing by the store.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.567
It's our pleasure.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.943
Okay, you have
to help me choose.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.278
I want an outfit that's gonna
make me feel confident,

20:38.404 --> 20:39.947
I've been laying low recently,

20:40.073 --> 20:41.741
and I just need something
that says "I'm back."

20:41.866 --> 20:43.910
Well, nothing says
you're back like backless.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.870
Plus, it'll make
your ass look like

20:45.995 --> 20:46.996
a ripe little melon.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.539
(all laughing)

20:48.664 --> 20:49.707
All right, backless it is.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.625
Thank you, girls.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.960
So that one's gonna be $400.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.757
Oh, yeah, actually,
I'm a little

20:57.882 --> 20:59.217
short on cash
right now.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.177
I was thinking
I could get it on layaway?

21:01.301 --> 21:04.055
Naomi, we're running
a business here.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.724
Come on.
What are friends for?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.018
Friends wouldn't
ask friends

21:09.143 --> 21:10.394
to give them dresses for free.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.897
(quietly):
Okay, bitch.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.481
What did you say?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.900
I called her a bitch.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.445
I'm sorry.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.613
I meant, ho.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.116
Kim, that's it.
We're out of here!

21:23.241 --> 21:24.742
You better stay out
of our store.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.577
Gladly, actually.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.996
When I get my trust fund,
you'll be sorry.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.623
Oh, and one more thing, Kim,

21:30.748 --> 21:31.958
just so you know,

21:32.083 --> 21:32.959
whenever you're on
"Who Wore It Best?"

21:33.084 --> 21:34.001
I vote for the other girl.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.836
(gasps)

21:43.261 --> 21:46.722
What would you say is
your biggest strength?

21:46.847 --> 21:47.890
And weakness?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.101
Okay, well, strength?

21:50.226 --> 21:52.228
Um, I guess would be
my enthusiasm.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.813
I'm generally
a pretty positive person.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.816
And, uh, weakness?

21:56.941 --> 21:59.735
Um, I can be a bit
of a perfectionist.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.070
Oh.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.613
So, what'd you do this summer?

22:04.198 --> 22:07.451
Uh... well, this summer, um,

22:07.576 --> 22:09.453
I just...
I decided to just lay low,

22:09.578 --> 22:11.038
you know, since
it's my last summer

22:11.164 --> 22:12.498
before college.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.167
I wanted to spend time
with the family,

22:14.292 --> 22:16.127
and I read a couple
good books, you know.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.091
Well, guess you can't expect
to have an earthquake

22:22.216 --> 22:23.843
without a few aftershocks.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.220
Yeah, that's true.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.681
I mean,
after something big happens,

22:28.806 --> 22:31.517
you can't just go on pretending
like nothing happened,

22:31.642 --> 22:34.270
because there
are always aftershocks.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.730
I mean, there have to be
aftershocks.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.400
I'm not sure
I'm following you.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.694
No. I-I know.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.696
I'm sorry.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.824
Um... okay.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.076
Look, the truth is,

22:49.202 --> 22:51.078
I didn't lay low this summer.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.539
I was actually on house arrest,

22:53.664 --> 22:55.749
because last year I was involved
in a hit-and-run.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.711
And I, um...

22:58.836 --> 23:00.921
I accidentally killed a man,

23:01.047 --> 23:03.632
and as much as I want
to put this behind me,

23:03.757 --> 23:04.925
I can't.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.384
It's part of who I am now,

23:06.510 --> 23:10.097
and I am done keeping
secrets, and-and I know

23:10.223 --> 23:11.598
that I shouldn't be
telling you this

23:11.724 --> 23:13.559
because I'm never going
to get this internship,

23:13.684 --> 23:15.853
and not only is it exactly
what I want to do,

23:15.978 --> 23:17.355
but I could really use the money

23:17.479 --> 23:18.856
because I have
all these legal bills

23:18.981 --> 23:20.607
and my father
just moved out, and...

23:20.733 --> 23:24.570
and I don't know why
I'm still talking.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.906
Um, well, there is a weakness.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.908
I... I ramble when I'm nervous.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.536
Um... so good luck

23:32.661 --> 23:34.580
with the rest of your search.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.083
I am sure you are going
to find someone great.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.793
Someone who is a hard worker

23:39.919 --> 23:41.545
and would
love this job

23:41.670 --> 23:43.421
the way that
I would have.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.649
(groans)
Power's still out.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.777
Hmm.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.987
Very interesting.
What?

24:07.113 --> 24:10.616
My father says a person's music
is a window into their soul.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.202
Of course, he's always
been partial to cliché.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.788
And booze.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.374
So, what does my music
collection say about me?

24:18.498 --> 24:22.336
Uh... Roberta Flack,
Rufus Wainwright.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.172
(chuckles)
You're much more sentimental

24:25.298 --> 24:26.966
than you'd
like to admit.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.759
Oh, it's nothing
to be ashamed about.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.886
I'm quite sentimental myself.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.972
Mmm.

24:33.097 --> 24:38.811
For example, I'll always
remember that I shared

24:38.936 --> 24:40.980
my first little
earthquake with Gidget.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.523
Don't call me that.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.321
Did you know that
"little earthquake"

24:48.446 --> 24:52.532
was a euphemism
for an orgasm?

25:17.891 --> 25:20.686
Ivy.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.229
Ivy.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.654
That must have been
some dream, Gidget.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.031
What?

25:32.156 --> 25:33.782
Are you ready
to go to the party?
Yeah.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.826
Uh...

25:35.951 --> 25:37.744
Sorry.
I'm just going to...

25:46.212 --> 25:48.088
(giggling)

25:48.214 --> 25:50.049
Went that well, huh?

25:50.174 --> 25:52.259
No. It went horribly.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.802
But I did it, Liam.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.055
I said I wanted to be a
different person this year--

25:56.180 --> 25:57.681
no lying, no hiding-- and...

25:57.806 --> 25:59.725
and so I just told her
about the accident,

25:59.850 --> 26:02.769
and... and it was
such a relief!

26:04.021 --> 26:05.439
No lying, no hiding.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.169
Mmm. No. No.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.837
This is exactly why
I didn't call you

26:28.962 --> 26:30.423
back this summer--
'cause I was afraid

26:30.548 --> 26:31.798
that this was
going to happen.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.175
Okay, if this is about Naomi,
she's clearly over me.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.968
It doesn't matter.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.012
She's my friend, and friends

26:37.137 --> 26:38.680
don't date friends'
ex-boyfriends.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.434
Well, good news--
I'm not attracted to Jasper.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.937
Okay, fine.
Naomi doesn't have to know.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.481
No. No lying, no
hiding, remember?

26:52.319 --> 26:55.239
So, what does that mean?

26:55.364 --> 26:56.907
Where does that leave us?

26:58.158 --> 26:59.617
I mean, we can still be friends.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.914
Well, what if I don't
want to be friends?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.707
Then what?

27:09.836 --> 27:12.630
Then, I guess we're not friends.

27:26.604 --> 27:29.064
Sure I can't get you
something to eat?

27:29.189 --> 27:31.108
No, I'm okay.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.152
(phone ringing)

27:37.448 --> 27:39.241
Laurel, hey.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.160
Oh, Ade, hang
on, hang on.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.453
Okay?
Bye, Mom.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.913
Mmm. Bye.
Drive safely, okay?

27:45.038 --> 27:45.998
Yeah.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.292
Bye.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.211
Babe, I... I just heard.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.088
Are you okay?

27:53.213 --> 27:55.382
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.301
I just... I can't
believe he's gone.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.886
Neither can I.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.097
I've known that kid
since he was 12.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.142
Make sure to take care
of yourself, okay?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.269
I'm guessing you're going to be
pretty sore tomorrow.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.728
Yeah, I will.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.982
Um, Laurel, hold on a second.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.026
Maybe a little bit of
soup would be good.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.194
Say no more.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.403
Thank you.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.113
Hey.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.408
Okay, I-I know that this...

28:21.534 --> 28:26.539
I know that this
is really weird timing,

28:26.664 --> 28:30.292
but, um... I mean,
I should still plan on coming

28:30.417 --> 28:31.377
to the studio next week, right?

28:31.502 --> 28:32.961
(sighs)

28:33.086 --> 28:35.422
You know, to talk about plans
for my album.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.303
Babe... I-I d... I d...
I did not want

28:41.428 --> 28:43.722
to get into this now.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.602
Okay, I'm going to give it
to you straight.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.188
Things have cooled off a little
on the Adrianna front.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.273
Okay, it happens all the time.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.941
You're new, there's heat,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.319
and then a song doesn't perform

28:57.444 --> 28:59.363
as well as expected and...

28:59.488 --> 29:00.989
Laurel, you don't understand

29:01.114 --> 29:02.949
how important this is to me.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.493
Okay, I-I dropped out of school
because singing

29:04.618 --> 29:06.161
is the only thing I want to do.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.371
And I'm not saying it's over.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.289
Okay, it's-it's just...

29:09.415 --> 29:10.832
on hold.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.001
(sighs)

29:13.126 --> 29:15.295
Okay.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.048
Look, um...

29:18.173 --> 29:20.384
I have a lot of new material.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.010
Okay, really great stuff

29:22.135 --> 29:23.845
that no one's heard.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.972
Will you just take a listen
to it, please?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.100
Of course, babe.
You know I will.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.185
Thank you.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.020
Take care of yourself, okay?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.481
And-and I'll check in
with you tomorrow.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.649
Bye.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.991
(sighs)

29:49.246 --> 29:51.665
♪ ♪

29:53.208 --> 29:55.043
I just feel so badly for him.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.754
You should have seen his face

29:56.878 --> 29:58.714
when the doctor told him
he tore his ACL.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.383
I mean, best case scenario--
he's out for the year.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.636
And that's best case
because he might not

30:03.761 --> 30:05.512
ever get his full range
of motion back.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.347
(grunts)
Whoa! Whoa, careful!

30:07.473 --> 30:09.015
(laughs) Who cares?

30:09.141 --> 30:11.017
Joanna's parents won't be back
for at least a week.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.436
We'll just blame it all
on the earthquake.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.022
Oh, hey. Look who's here.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.066
You came.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.526
Hey!
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

30:19.652 --> 30:22.279
It's not like I got to
train in the morning.
Hi.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.449
My whole life, I've
had to get up early,

30:25.574 --> 30:28.243
watch what I eat,
get enough sleep.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.370
Now it's time to
have some fun.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.539
Mmm.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.166
To...

30:34.291 --> 30:36.376
moving on.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.462
Moving on sounds good to me.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.383
Is that a freshman?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.427
What the hell's she doing here?

30:47.721 --> 30:50.974
So, um... did
you drive here?

30:51.099 --> 30:53.101
Drunk?

30:53.226 --> 30:56.188
No. No, not drunk.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.523
Buzzed.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.108
Ooh, speaking of...

31:00.233 --> 31:01.485
I'm running low on booze.

31:01.610 --> 31:02.611
Hey.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.571
Maybe you should
slow down.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.323
Maybe I don't want
to slow down.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.407
Teddy, come on.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.950
I know you're upset.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.494
Yeah, I'll say.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.120
I pretty much
destroyed my life.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.706
Don't blame yourself.
You couldn't have known.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.081
The doctor cleared
you to play.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.124
(makes buzzer sound)
Wrong.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.459
What?

31:19.753 --> 31:22.422
He told me to rest my knee
for six weeks,

31:22.548 --> 31:24.132
and I didn't listen.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.467
So here we are.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.347
Ah.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.973
It's going
to be okay.

31:32.098 --> 31:33.475
(scoffs) How? Huh?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.268
I may never play again.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.978
Then, you'll find
something else you love.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.772
It's not that easy.
I-I didn't...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.315
And obviously,
you don't understand,

31:40.440 --> 31:41.483
because you've never been great
at anything.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.653
Don't take this out on me.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.578
(sighs)

31:52.703 --> 31:54.621
So... just call me back.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.582
Okay? I want to talk to you.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.375
Me, too.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.587
Hey. I thought you had your
family dinner thing tonight.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.797
I did, but...

32:03.922 --> 32:06.132
I had to apologize first.
Look, I'm so sorry.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.801
I was acting
like a jealous freak.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.678
Look, it's okay.
No, no, no.
It's...

32:09.803 --> 32:11.221
it's not. I trust you.
I complete...
Dixon.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.558
I'm the one who needs
to be apologizing.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.852
I mean, you had these plans,
and then I ruined them.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.521
But... if you want to tell me
what we were going to do...

32:19.646 --> 32:21.815
Oh, well...
I was going to take you

32:21.981 --> 32:23.275
down to your favorite
taco truck.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.359
(laughing)
Yeah.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.195
And possibly have
Pedro play reggae

32:27.320 --> 32:28.488
while you scarfed
down your carnitas.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.031
Hey, I don't scarf.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.241
All right?

32:31.366 --> 32:32.576
I wolf.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.078
Oh. I'm sorry.
(chuckles)

32:35.203 --> 32:36.329
I stand corrected.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.332
So, as you
wolfed them down,

32:39.458 --> 32:41.167
I was going to tell you
something.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.210
What?

32:42.335 --> 32:43.545
Not now.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.547
You know, I wanted
the moment to be special.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.007
The song, sauce running
down your chin.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.093
That kind of thing.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.344
(reggae music playing)

32:51.470 --> 32:52.596
Tell me now.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.515
Come on, tell me.

32:58.518 --> 33:02.021
Well, I was gonna tell you...

33:02.147 --> 33:04.775
that I love you.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.405
I love you, too.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.616
I really do.

33:20.457 --> 33:21.875
Hey, Naomi.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.545
Naomi.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.715
Can I tell you something
I have always wanted

33:28.841 --> 33:30.383
to tell you but I never could

33:30.509 --> 33:32.385
'cause I'm not usually
this hammered?

33:32.511 --> 33:33.386
On Mondays.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.555
You are...

33:35.681 --> 33:38.475
hot.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.728
Thanks.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.856
Hey, wait up.

33:43.981 --> 33:45.315
I thought you were
the kind of girl

33:45.440 --> 33:47.233
who likes
being told she's hot.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.862
Yeah, I do.

33:49.987 --> 33:53.114
I'm... I just hear it
so often, it gets old.

33:54.491 --> 33:55.784
What?

33:55.909 --> 33:57.452
I don't know.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.454
There's just something

33:59.579 --> 34:01.331
different about you.
No, there's not.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.668
It's like, um, it's like
Katie Holmes after Tom Cruise.

34:04.793 --> 34:05.711
You know, still hot,

34:05.836 --> 34:08.630
but different.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.554
There's nothing
different about me.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.304
I'm just the same
as I was before.

34:17.429 --> 34:18.598
Before what?

34:19.641 --> 34:22.143
Doesn't matter.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.061
Let's go upstairs.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.358
And tell your guys
they can come, too.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.578
DIXON:
7:59. Made it home
under the wire.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.371
Whoa.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.331
This place looks like
it was hit with an earthquake.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.166
Is it 8:00 already?

34:45.291 --> 34:48.335
Okay, um, Dixon,
why don't you set the table.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.337
But be careful

34:49.462 --> 34:51.339
because it's dark
over there.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.634
Mom, Mom, uh,
maybe we should just go out.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.053
No, I cook every year.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.679
I know, but, Mom,
things are different.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.806
It wasn't even
that big an earthquake.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.683
We're not talking about
the earthquake.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.727
Things are different
because Dad's living

35:03.852 --> 35:05.353
45 minutes away.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.354
Things are different

35:06.479 --> 35:07.522
because you guys
are separated.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.523
Okay, I know that.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.566
You don't think
I know that?

35:09.691 --> 35:11.026
We don't know.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.819
I mean, ever since he
moved away a month ago,

35:12.945 --> 35:14.029
you've been acting like
everything's fine.

35:14.153 --> 35:16.322
Well, what would you like me
to do, cry all the time?

35:16.448 --> 35:19.284
Because I really don't
feel like crying all the time.

35:19.409 --> 35:22.621
No, Mom, we don't want you
to cry all the time.

35:22.746 --> 35:26.207
But sometimes... it's okay.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.208
Okay?
Yeah.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.794
It's okay.

35:28.919 --> 35:30.921
Ah, come here.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.425
Oh.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.636
I'm the one who's supposed
to be taking care of you guys.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.220
Look, and you do.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.555
But every now and then,

35:40.680 --> 35:42.223
you got to let us take
care of you, too, okay?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.646
(piano playing gentle melody)
Okay.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.689
Okay, we should
eat the cold cuts

35:49.815 --> 35:50.941
because they're gonna go bad.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.819
But, um, the ice cream
will go bad faster.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.320
(chuckles)

35:55.445 --> 35:56.488
Hey, at least drink some milk.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.406
Yes, ma'am.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.783
Potato chip, anybody?

35:59.908 --> 36:00.784
Wait, wait.
Thank you.

36:00.909 --> 36:01.868
Those are not perishable.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.244
Mm, they're not?
My mistake.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.370
(laughter, phone ringing)

36:04.496 --> 36:05.664
Hello.

36:05.789 --> 36:06.790
WOMAN:
Annie.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.333
Hi. It's Katherine Upton.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.709
Oh.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.252
I-I won't keep you long.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.463
I just wanted to offer you
the internship.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.840
Shut up!

36:14.965 --> 36:16.424
I-I mean, don't shut up.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.383
I mean

36:17.509 --> 36:18.844
why?

36:18.969 --> 36:21.220
No, I mean thank you.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.681
(chuckles)
Thank you so much.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.349
You're so welcome.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.601
And as for the "why,"
you had a great resume,

36:26.726 --> 36:28.186
you had a lot of passion,

36:28.311 --> 36:29.980
and frankly,
I really admired your honesty.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.482
So, I'll see you
next Monday, right?

36:32.607 --> 36:33.441
Perfect.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.693
Th-That sounds great.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.694
I look forward to it.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.236
Bye, Annie.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.780
Bye.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.703
I got the internship!

36:44.828 --> 36:45.787
Yeah!
I got it!

36:45.912 --> 36:47.288
Good for you.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.082
Thank you.
That's great.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.251

the perfect girl.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.754

she's responsible,

desperate enough to do it.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.561
God, what are you
talking about?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.939
Come on, let's
just do it.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.816
I'm telling you,
it's not a big deal.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.943
♪ And this is me ♪
(chuckles)

39:22.068 --> 39:23.611
♪ Trying to say good-bye ♪

39:23.736 --> 39:24.863
Oh, my God.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.531
Silver, wait!

39:27.866 --> 39:30.869
♪ And this is me ♪

39:30.994 --> 39:35.040
♪ Saying I don't want to cry ♪

39:35.165 --> 39:38.001

39:38.126 --> 39:41.796
♪ Good-bye, good-bye ♪

39:41.921 --> 39:46.176

39:56.769 --> 39:58.521
(song ends)

40:00.773 --> 40:02.650
Can I tell you the truth?

40:04.194 --> 40:07.239
I-I was always a little...

40:07.364 --> 40:08.948
lukewarm on
your original material,

40:09.074 --> 40:13.661
but that song, Ade,

40:13.786 --> 40:17.498
that's the best thing
that you've ever written.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.500
Hey, don't worry.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.211
Laurel is gonna love it.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.848
(phone ringing)

40:33.973 --> 40:35.975
Hello.

40:38.895 --> 40:39.938
(chuckles)

40:40.063 --> 40:41.814
Wow. I'm thrilled.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.857
I was hoping

40:42.982 --> 40:43.775
to get you as my advisor.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.277
Me, too.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.153
We're going to have
a great time together.
