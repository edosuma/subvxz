00:14.310 --> 00:16.180
Forty-love!

00:19.690 --> 00:21.700
This is match point. You ready?

00:21.710 --> 00:24.660
Finally. Let's get it over with.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.930
Ace!

00:33.830 --> 00:36.220
I hope you're not going easy on
me 'cause i'm new around here.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.820
Easy? What, that was brutal!

00:39.250 --> 00:40.910
My sweat has sweat.

00:40.930 --> 00:43.320
What, are you some kind of
tennis hustler or something?

00:43.330 --> 00:46.120
Figure new town, new school,
new unexpecting kids to beat?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.820
Hey, i didn't take
your money or anything.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.980
No, just my self respect. Look out!

00:49.990 --> 00:52.130
Diana, i told you, follow through.

00:52.150 --> 00:54.450
It's all about the
follow through. Come on.

01:03.050 --> 01:05.319
Any day now.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.640
You're welcome.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.830
What was that all about?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.010
You know diana morrison?

01:17.030 --> 01:19.660
I used to, back when i lived
in grandview the first time.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.000
We were friends.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.820
It was like a million years ago.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.920
Diana? Somebody help!

01:26.900 --> 01:28.550
Diana, please!

01:28.570 --> 01:30.510
What's happened?

01:30.820 --> 01:33.200
Diana! Diana, diana! Please wake up!

01:33.210 --> 01:35.110
She just dropped out of
nowhere, she won't respond!

01:35.180 --> 01:35.800
I'm calling
9-1-1.

01:35.810 --> 01:37.980
- I'll stay here. Go get help.
- Ok.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.160
Diana, it's olivia.

01:40.170 --> 01:43.230
Diana, please wake up!

01:43.240 --> 01:47.410
Yes, we need an ambulance.
Grandview park at the tennis courts.

01:47.420 --> 01:50.940
- A girl's collapsed.
- Why won't you wake up? What's wrong with you?

01:50.950 --> 01:54.620
Diana... Diana!

01:57.950 --> 02:00.340
- Thank you.
- Sure.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.830
- Thank you, nurse. Jim.
- Hi, doctor.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.960
Melinda, how you feeling?

02:04.970 --> 02:06.010
I feel ok.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.680
No more nausea, light-headedness?

02:07.690 --> 02:10.070
Um, no.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.780
Well... You're not pregnant.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.180
Yeah, we-- we
figured as much.

02:18.190 --> 02:21.170
Yeah, that's what the
pregnancy test said, too.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.870
All ten of them.

02:26.550 --> 02:30.070
So then... Everything
that i was feeling...

02:31.070 --> 02:32.630
It was all just in my head?

02:32.640 --> 02:38.050
No, you did conceive, but your
body didn't support the pregnancy.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.140
Doc, what does that mean?

02:45.150 --> 02:47.940
If you're worrying about your
chances of having a baby, don't.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.690
There's plenty of treatable
conditions that can account for this.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.360
Let me run some tests, and
we'll go from there, ok?

02:53.390 --> 02:54.100
Ok.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.910
The nurse will schedule
your next appointment.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.910
Thanks.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.330
I never really figured
it would be this hard.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.730
It's gonna be ok.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.440
We're gonna make this happen, together.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.830
You need to finish your
shift. Go, i'll be ok.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.730
- You sure?
- Yeah.

03:20.690 --> 03:23.240
'Cause you can hold on to
my hand as long as you want.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.750
Sorry.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.310
I love you. I'll see you later.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.320
Coming in!

03:42.330 --> 03:46.430
Doc, bp 75 over 42. Pulse
is rapid and irregular.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.120
I want an ecg and a chest x-ray.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.100
- And get me a consent to treat.
- I'm on it!

03:50.110 --> 03:51.890
Do we have her name?

03:51.900 --> 03:54.370
Diana morrison.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.560
Dorothy?

04:00.330 --> 04:01.830
Ned, what are you
doing here? Are you ok?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.620
Yeah, i'm fine. We're both fine.

04:03.630 --> 04:04.890
One, two...

04:04.900 --> 04:06.300
Girl collapsed on the tennis courts.

04:06.310 --> 04:08.150
Olivia and i wanted to
make sure she was ok.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.640
She has to be ok.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.090
- Olivia!
- Mom!

04:12.670 --> 04:14.620
I went to the courts to pick
you up but you weren't there,

04:14.630 --> 04:16.070
And they said a girl had collapsed!

04:16.079 --> 04:17.930
- I thought that--
- i'm fine, mom.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.810
I'm sorry for scaring
you. I should have called.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.670
It's diana.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.000
Diana morrison?

04:26.010 --> 04:27.970
Where's diana morrison? I'm her mother.

04:27.980 --> 04:30.810
They told me she was here.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.810
Olivia?

04:34.900 --> 04:37.490
What are you doing here?

04:38.730 --> 04:40.960
Mrs. Morrison, i was
at the courts with ned.

04:40.970 --> 04:41.970
Diana was there, too.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.150
She was taking a lesson, i guess.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.170
She just collapsed.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.120
Was it heat stroke?

04:48.140 --> 04:49.630
She must have just fainted.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.380
She barely ate any breakfast.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.290
No!

04:55.930 --> 04:58.570
No!

05:01.980 --> 05:04.460
Time of death...

05:06.220 --> 05:09.240
What do you mean, time of death?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.060
You all right? Did you know this girl?

05:13.550 --> 05:18.050
No, no, i'm fine. Um,
time of death, 3:49.

05:18.060 --> 05:21.290
What just happened?

05:25.610 --> 05:28.380
Do you know me?

05:35.180 --> 05:37.660
Wait!

05:39.100 --> 05:40.990
Answer me!

05:41.250 --> 05:43.310
What just happened?

05:43.620 --> 05:46.110
Are you the doctor?

05:47.460 --> 05:49.480
When can i see her?

05:49.490 --> 05:52.410
Your daughter suffered
a blood clot in her lung.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.460
I'm very sorry.

05:53.470 --> 05:57.190
We did everything we could, but we weren't
able to revive your daughter, and she died.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.090
No, no! Not diana!

06:01.100 --> 06:05.730
No! Not my little girl!

06:07.080 --> 06:09.510
No!She
can't--

06:09.520 --> 06:11.670
is there anyone we can call?

06:11.690 --> 06:13.020
A spouse, another family member?

06:13.030 --> 06:16.440
No, it's just me and diana.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.390
I'm sorry.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.570
No...

06:21.780 --> 06:23.180
No, let's go.

06:23.190 --> 06:24.910
Mom, she doesn't have anyone!

06:24.920 --> 06:28.860
We're probably just making it
worse. Come on, we don't belong here.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.370
Is diana here?

06:38.380 --> 06:40.400
Yeah.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.090
She's with her mom. I think she
wanted to say goodbye before moving on.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.330
Or maybe not.

07:30.430 --> 07:33.330
It's crazy. It just makes no sense.

07:33.340 --> 07:35.780
I know. 16 years old, way too young.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.140
Is eli talking to the kids?

07:37.150 --> 07:39.070
Yeah, ned says he's helping a lot.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.880
And thank you so much for
suggesting him for that.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.360
He's a good therapist.
He really listens.

07:44.370 --> 07:46.760
Well, when you told me how important
diana and her mom were to everyone--

07:46.770 --> 07:48.620
Ooh, let me give you a hand.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.740
Yeah, all the kids in the neighborhood
used to go over there and play.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.700
They just had one of those homes,
you know, very warm and inviting.

07:54.710 --> 07:56.060
Everyone loved them.

07:56.090 --> 07:58.760
Except for olivia's
mom, from what i saw.

07:58.780 --> 07:59.860
I just don't get that.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.740
Well, it seemed mutual.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.690
You know, maybe it's just because
cynthia was worried about her daughter.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.480
No, it seemed like
something more than that.

08:06.490 --> 08:09.930
I mean, ned said that the daughter
was chilly with olivia at the court.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.430
She might have just been
feeling sick, you know?

08:12.440 --> 08:15.390
Yeah, maybe, but it didn't end there.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.160
Meaning?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.700
What? Was there a
ghost? Did you see diana?

08:23.710 --> 08:24.940
Are you sure you want to know that?

08:24.950 --> 08:29.180
Anything's better than thinking a
spirit that young would just vanish!

08:31.600 --> 08:33.580
She didn't vanish. I
saw her at the hospital.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.429
Well, did she say anything?

08:35.440 --> 08:38.280
I mean, did she go into
the light or whatever?

08:38.289 --> 08:39.280
Impressive!

08:39.289 --> 08:40.780
No, she went in a different direction.

08:40.789 --> 08:43.059
She followed olivia and her mom home.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.130
Well, what does that mean?

08:44.140 --> 08:47.000
Mmm, my experience? Nothing good.

09:01.690 --> 09:04.310
What can i say?

09:06.620 --> 09:09.650
Mom, dad, are you back?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.620
Hello?

09:17.630 --> 09:20.300
Is someone here?

09:22.770 --> 09:26.480
Hello? Is someone here?

09:30.010 --> 09:30.530
Hello?

09:30.540 --> 09:31.820
Mr. Or Mrs. Keller, please.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.620
No, they're not in right
now. Can i take a message?

09:34.630 --> 09:37.500
I can't hear you! Who's calling?

09:42.240 --> 09:44.510
What's happening?

10:03.520 --> 10:06.080
If there's anything we
could do, Mrs. Morrison...

10:06.090 --> 10:08.480
Just don't be strangers.

10:08.490 --> 10:11.660
My home will always be open to you kids.

10:16.890 --> 10:19.360
Techno spook by the computer.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.260
Scary.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.600
Where did you hear that?

10:22.610 --> 10:26.610
Olivia was telling some of her
girlfriends this morning at assembly.

10:27.350 --> 10:30.080
- I'm really sorry, Mrs. Morrison.
- Is that olivia with diana's mom?

10:30.090 --> 10:31.450
Yeah.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.330
Well, that didn't seem to go very well.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.340
Let's go see what's going on.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.580
Olivia?

11:02.280 --> 11:03.430
My name is eli james.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.480
I'm a therapist over at rockland u.

11:06.490 --> 11:11.790
I was asked to come here today to speak
to your fellow schoolmates about your loss.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.720
Yeah, i've seen you around.

11:13.730 --> 11:16.150
Ned said, uh, you two were
there when it happened?

11:16.160 --> 11:18.160
Yeah, whatever it was.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.750
Does anyone know how
she got sick like that?

11:20.760 --> 11:23.560
I haven't heard anything yet.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.810
When's that picture from?

11:28.820 --> 11:29.970
It's you and diana, right?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.770
Yeah, we were, like, 7 or 8.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.040
See that cast on her leg?

11:34.050 --> 11:39.020
She just had her ankle surgery, and
i signed her cast right there, "ok."

11:39.030 --> 11:41.240
my ironic initials.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.240
You said you and diana
used to be friends?

11:44.250 --> 11:46.970
Yeah, the first time
i lived in grandview.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.060
It's ancient history.

11:49.080 --> 11:54.880
Olivia, i do this a lot, and i promise
you, if you're feeling bad about something,

11:54.900 --> 11:58.440
Talking about it always makes it better.

12:06.650 --> 12:10.330
When we were little, our moms were such
good friends that we did everything together.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.720
It was almost like we were sisters.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.500
With play dates and sports and camping.

12:14.510 --> 12:18.510
We even have the same birthday, so our parties
were like this whole big deal every year.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.890
And what happened?

12:19.900 --> 12:22.070
It just ended.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.640
I remember one night i woke up,
and my mom was in bed with me,

12:25.660 --> 12:29.860
And she was rocking me,
just crying and crying.

12:29.880 --> 12:34.270
I asked her what was wrong, but all
she would say was that she loved me.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.530
And then after that, everything changed.

12:36.550 --> 12:40.120
Diana's mom and dad split up,
we stopped hanging out with them,

12:40.140 --> 12:42.090
And then we got transferred to texas.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.010
Or my dad, so we left.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.620
Did you and diana keep in touch?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.040
We tried, or at least i did.

12:47.050 --> 12:50.040
I wrote her and stuff, but
she never wrote me back.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.780
I guess diana made new friends.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.240
My mom said that i should, too.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.280
She told me to forget about
her. It was really weird.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.690
It was like she was mad at her, too.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.210
Well, what happened when
your dad got transferred back?

13:02.220 --> 13:03.930
She didn't write me in 8 years.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.940
I mean, why would she
want to be my friend now?

13:05.950 --> 13:09.690
She didn't need me when
she had all of this.

13:15.570 --> 13:18.630
What's dad doing here?

13:26.870 --> 13:29.580
Excuse me, i better go.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.060
What's that all about?

13:37.070 --> 13:39.160
If it looks like a duck,
quacks like a duck...

13:39.170 --> 13:40.710
Get your mind out of the gutter.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.400
She pulled him aside, she hugged
him, she whispered sweet nothings...

13:44.410 --> 13:46.920
It was a prayer vigil.
Who didn't she hug?

13:46.930 --> 13:48.990
Forget my masters in
clinical psych for a minute,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.240
Which i'd like to forget 'cause
i'm still paying off the loans,

13:51.250 --> 13:54.020
And let's just look at the
circumstantial evidence.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.090
What evidence?

13:55.100 --> 13:58.440
Two women who used to be best
friends suddenly become enemies

13:58.450 --> 13:59.980
And don't give their kids a reason.

13:59.990 --> 14:03.390
Yeah, but that still doesn't explain the
ghost's weird behavior at the hospital,

14:03.720 --> 14:05.920
Or following the wrong family home.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.650
Maybe diana knew about
the affair before she died.

14:08.670 --> 14:11.300
Maybe that's why she was so nasty
to olivia at the tennis courts,

14:11.310 --> 14:14.730
And then went to her house to haunt her.

14:14.740 --> 14:17.090
Unless...

14:17.100 --> 14:18.420
Unless?

14:18.440 --> 14:21.580
Diana found something out at the
hospital that proved more than the affair.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.560
What if she found out something
that proved everything?

14:26.050 --> 14:27.300
I'm gonna have to buy a vowel.

14:27.320 --> 14:32.650
Ok, what if olivia's dad was her dad, too,
and she found that out in the hospital records?

14:32.660 --> 14:34.550
Well, that would explain
why he was at the vigil.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.010
I mean, if he lost a daughter, too...

14:36.020 --> 14:40.200
Yeah, and why diana went home with
the kellers instead of her own mom.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.630
Olivia could be the half-sister
she never knew she had.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.430
Or wanted.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.540
Making olivia's dad...

14:47.550 --> 14:50.630
The man who ruined everything.

15:00.790 --> 15:05.240
Hey, kiddo. Oh, god, you startled
me. What are you doing up?

15:05.250 --> 15:07.090
I can't sleep again.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.890
Thinking about diana?

15:12.550 --> 15:14.760
Um, mom won't even talk to me about her.

15:14.770 --> 15:18.310
I know that we weren't friends
at the end, but she died.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.200
What happened, dad?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.520
I mean, with mom and Mrs. M.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.780
How can mom be so cold
to her, especially now?

15:25.790 --> 15:27.410
If you know, please tell me.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.830
Honey, i just think that...

15:29.840 --> 15:33.470
I don't know, maybe there's
a little guilt, 'cause...

15:34.760 --> 15:37.420
We still have you.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.520
Did you hear that?

15:39.530 --> 15:41.550
It's the same noise that
i heard the other night.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.910
It's coming from
upstairs. It's the attic.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.140
- Wait here, ok?
- No way.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.220
Dad, i'm scared.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.770
Don't worry, honey. It's probably
just rats in the rat traps.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.650
Those are no rats.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.780
That's strange.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.940
- Dad!
- Honey, are you ok?

16:13.950 --> 16:15.650
Yeah!

16:35.710 --> 16:37.260
it's diana, i know it is.

16:37.270 --> 16:41.490
My dad claims that there's some
sort of reasonable explanation,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.730
Although he sure isn't
coming up with one.

16:43.750 --> 16:44.900
So what is he saying?

16:44.910 --> 16:46.350
Not to tell my mother.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.330
He says that he doesn't
want to worry her.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.890
But he went to work, and my
mom's out, and i'm so scared.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.660
She keeps doing it!

16:52.680 --> 16:57.220
I put them away so many times, and
she keeps bringing them back out.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.530
Diana did this.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.870
You believe me?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.600
Yes.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.780
We both do.

17:05.530 --> 17:07.579
Why?

17:07.990 --> 17:10.480
Because i can see spirits.

17:10.490 --> 17:13.140
I've seen diana's. I watched her
follow you home from the hospital.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.700
That's why ned wanted
you to meet with me.

17:14.710 --> 17:16.869
Do the photos always look like this?

17:16.880 --> 17:20.150
Yeah, each time i
found them the same way.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.730
Starting with photos of my mom
and dad growing up, their wedding,

17:23.740 --> 17:26.450
And all of my baby
photos up through now.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.590
It's like the whole family
history laid out in photos.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.400
And then there's the phone calls.

17:30.410 --> 17:31.160
Phone calls?

17:31.170 --> 17:34.610
Yeah, it rings, i answer, and i can
hear someone trying to say something.

17:34.630 --> 17:36.170
Does it sound like diana's voice?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.860
No, it sounded like a woman,
but it's totally garbled.

17:38.870 --> 17:42.990
And then it's cut off by
this awful screeching sound.

17:43.950 --> 17:47.220
Um, where's your telephone?

17:47.230 --> 17:49.560
It's in the kitchen.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.200
Please tell me you have caller I. D.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.670
Ok, so you said that the last
interrupted call came in...

17:57.680 --> 17:59.050
About an hour ago.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.200
Got it.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.980
No! It's happening again.

18:06.990 --> 18:09.830
It's ok. We're here.

18:18.870 --> 18:19.640
She's gone.

18:19.650 --> 18:22.680
Why does diana care
about me and my family?

18:22.690 --> 18:24.280
I don't know.

18:24.310 --> 18:27.400
But i think i know someone who does.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.590
I'm looking for a nurse,
but i don't know her name.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.040
She was working the E. R.when that
high school kid died, diana morrison.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.650
Is there anything i can help you with?

18:38.660 --> 18:42.660
Well, it was just a tough day, and so i wanted
to thank her for reaching out to the family.

18:42.670 --> 18:44.240
Her name is perry, dorothy perry.

18:44.250 --> 18:48.620
I'm sure she'd appreciate it, if she were
here, i know she was trying to make some copies,

18:48.630 --> 18:51.280
And a phone call, and...

18:51.290 --> 18:52.670
Nothing was working for her.

18:52.690 --> 18:54.250
Is there a copier nearby?

18:54.260 --> 18:55.940
Um, the records room on the third floor.

18:55.950 --> 18:58.560
Great. Thank you.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.040
What is going on here?

19:18.050 --> 19:23.240
Hello? Anybody there?

19:43.810 --> 19:47.970
Wait, nurse perry! Nurse perry!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.970
I just want to talk!

20:00.670 --> 20:05.560
Oh, my god! Please,
somebody, help me! Help!

20:20.670 --> 20:22.480
The word is, she's going
to be out for a while.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.860
They've got her on heavy
painkillers and anti-anxiety meds.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.310
Did you get anything else?

20:27.330 --> 20:29.350
Oh, yeah. She got
worked over pretty good.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.460
Head laceration, 2 broken ribs,
hairline fracture of her collarbone.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.460
Diana was so angry at her.

20:36.470 --> 20:39.310
Yeah, mel, how was an E.
R.nurse involved in this?

20:39.320 --> 20:43.310
I think she was on the phone with olivia's
family trying to tell them something.

20:43.330 --> 20:46.090
When i saw her, she was
coming out of the record room.

20:46.110 --> 20:49.360
Melinda, come on, it's one thing to go asking
around about a medical condition, it's another to--

20:49.380 --> 20:51.810
Yeah, but we still don't know
what caused diana's death!

20:51.830 --> 20:54.220
I don't think the answer is in
those records. Those are old records.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.020
Maybe it was something else.

20:56.030 --> 20:58.530
Maybe something in diana's past
that the doctor should have seen.

20:58.540 --> 20:59.520
Maybe they made a mistake.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.460
I mean, she was a
healthy 16-year-old girl.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.150
Ok, then if that's the case, why is the
ghost haunting olivia and her family?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.700
I don't know.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.200
The girl is dead, a woman is
hurt, and i am out of theories.

21:09.520 --> 21:14.020
Please. All i need is 10 minutes.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.840
Here's m.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.310
Moore, moriarty.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.750
Where's morrison?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.160
Missing. Hold on a second.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.430
These must be waiting to be re-filed.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.650
There you go.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.800
Her medical records.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.030
These are from like 8 years ago.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.180
Oh, looks like she had an operation.

21:48.910 --> 21:51.350
Fractured her ankle.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.010
And diana's birth record.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.890
Mr. Keller's not listed as her father.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.310
Why would a nurse want
copies of this stuff?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.110
Wait a minute, this
is weird. Look at this.

22:02.120 --> 22:07.070
Her blood type on her surgery record doesn't
match her blood type on her birth record.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.980
A. B.,

22:09.440 --> 22:10.960
O.

22:10.970 --> 22:13.420
Do hospitals make mistakes like that?

22:13.430 --> 22:15.830
It's possible, but rare.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.080
Or maybe there's another possibility.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.430
I saw the records she put together.

22:42.440 --> 22:46.330
I know why you're angry, but i think
she was trying to do the right thing.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.350
She wanted the truth to come out.

22:48.370 --> 22:51.070
There are some mistakes
that you can't fix!

22:51.080 --> 22:53.180
I found that out the day that i died.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.250
Answer me!

22:55.270 --> 22:57.500
What just happened?

22:57.910 --> 23:01.190
I followed her to the records room.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.340
And right away, i saw something weird.

23:07.350 --> 23:09.980
What are you looking for?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.830
And that's when i
realized what happened.

23:26.850 --> 23:29.160
Olivia and i were switched at birth.

23:29.170 --> 23:30.930
The blood types didn't match, i know.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.260
But that's not what was
really upsetting her.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.780
She looked so guilty!

23:35.810 --> 23:37.150
What have i done?

23:37.160 --> 23:39.860
Like she had done something awful.

23:44.070 --> 23:46.910
You were there the day i was born, too?

23:47.220 --> 23:50.840
And that's when it hit
me-- it was her mistake.

23:50.850 --> 23:54.110
That's how she knew to look
in those files. It's her fault!

23:55.820 --> 24:00.220
Look, i know that you're upset, but i...

24:00.540 --> 24:03.170
I think it was just a mistake, you know?

24:03.180 --> 24:04.220
A stupid accident.

24:04.230 --> 24:06.020
Do you want to know what's stupid?

24:06.030 --> 24:07.550
How could i not have known?

24:07.560 --> 24:10.560
I mean, we even have the same birthday!

24:10.570 --> 24:12.540
And my-so called family?

24:12.560 --> 24:18.320
My mom is blonde, blue-eyed,
a semi-pro tennis player.

24:18.330 --> 24:23.340
So i always told myself that i sucked
at tennis because i took after my dad.

24:24.150 --> 24:28.310
Well, it turns out, i do take after
my mom, i just had the wrong one.

24:28.340 --> 24:32.270
Look, i know that this is painful, but i can
help you, talk to your mom, your birth family.

24:32.290 --> 24:34.820
No! They can't know.

24:34.830 --> 24:36.480
Well, i think you need them to.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.230
That's why you went to
the keller's house, right?

24:38.260 --> 24:41.030
So that you could reconnect
with the family you came from?

24:41.070 --> 24:44.430
You need to make peace with
this so that you can move on.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.040
That woman's mistake has
caused enough damage already.

24:48.050 --> 24:50.500
Well, you don't control that
anymore.I know that's upsetting, but--

24:50.510 --> 24:55.460
take a look at that nurse and
tell me what i can and i can't do.

24:57.140 --> 25:01.170
I will do whatever i have to do.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.360
No one can find out.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.500
Hi, Ms.perry.

25:16.520 --> 25:21.320
Um, my name is melinda gordon and i'd like
to talk to you, if you're feeling up to it.

25:21.330 --> 25:23.760
You're the one who came
looking for me when i fell?

25:23.770 --> 25:25.660
Yes.

25:25.670 --> 25:28.500
I thought you might have some
information on diana morrison,

25:28.530 --> 25:32.560
And now i couldn't be
more certain that you do

25:32.570 --> 25:34.910
i know what happened the
day that diana was born.

25:34.930 --> 25:38.340
I know that she was
switched with olivia keller.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.740
Look, i know that you're scared.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.520
A lot of really strange things are
happening to you, but trust me--

25:45.530 --> 25:48.880
They won't end until
you admit what you did.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.560
What i did?

25:50.570 --> 25:52.520
No!I--

25:54.280 --> 26:00.090
i was there when it happened, but i'm
not the one who switched those girls.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.990
Ok, the day that diana morrison was born,
there'd been this huge accident on the interstate.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.800
We were understaffed and overwhelmed.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.580
The bracelet must have
come off in the bath.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.570
The charge nurse seems confused.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.270
Um, is everything ok?

26:39.280 --> 26:40.600
You were sent to room 214.

26:40.610 --> 26:43.560
You got to get Mrs. Keller
up and walking. Go, now!

26:43.570 --> 26:46.150
I was fresh out of nursing school.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.610
I was trying to learn without
asking too many questions.

26:49.620 --> 26:53.400
What could i do? I didn't have
any proof. It was just a feeling.

26:54.790 --> 26:58.220
But i did remember those girls' names.

26:59.810 --> 27:06.420
Then i saw the mothers bonding
and talking in the hallways, and...

27:06.880 --> 27:09.980
Cradling their babies.

27:09.990 --> 27:13.610
And then you saw them
again 16 years later.

27:14.270 --> 27:16.500
I recognized her name when
the paramedics brought her in.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.230
Do we have her name?

27:18.240 --> 27:19.880
Diana morrison.

27:19.900 --> 27:24.940
Circumstances of her death, the blood
clot, it made me wonder all over again.

27:24.950 --> 27:28.170
So i pulled the girl's medical records.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.520
That's what confirmed it.

27:32.540 --> 27:35.200
You know, i've been trying to
contact the families ever since.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.380
It's just that some...

27:38.400 --> 27:42.010
Something just... Doesn't want to let...

27:43.770 --> 27:44.900
What's happening to me?

27:44.910 --> 27:46.920
Look, it's gonna be ok.

27:46.930 --> 27:50.630
You suspected for 16 years.

27:50.640 --> 27:54.040
I need to know why you're so
determined to tell them now.

27:54.050 --> 27:57.720
Because the blood clot that killed
diana was a genetic condition.

27:57.730 --> 28:00.960
It could affect someone else
in her biological family.

28:00.970 --> 28:04.100
They have to be told.

28:07.630 --> 28:09.480
That's a tough one, even for you.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.690
I have to tell them, obviously.

28:11.700 --> 28:14.210
I mean the kellers need
to know about the disease,

28:14.220 --> 28:17.370
and then cynthia morrison's
going to find out.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.520
I just don't know what's going to
happen to the ghost or the families.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.540
I can't even imagine.

28:22.550 --> 28:27.150
I mean, mourning your child,
only to find out she isn't yours.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.680
And then the child that is
yours, belongs to someone else.

28:30.690 --> 28:32.290
Olivia's parents, too.

28:32.300 --> 28:35.230
I mean, their birth child is dead.

28:35.250 --> 28:38.070
They're never going to
get to know her as theirs.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.840
I guess that's why diana's been fighting
so hard to keep this all a secret.

28:42.850 --> 28:46.530
It's all just to protect
everyone from the big bombshell.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.770
Who do you tell first?

28:49.510 --> 28:53.010
I think i have to start with
the woman who raised her.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.130
So kind of you to bring this by.

28:58.140 --> 29:00.150
I think everyone misses diana.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.240
I know that ned does.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.500
Oh, he's a sweet boy.

29:03.510 --> 29:05.920
Is that how you know my
daughter, through ned?

29:05.930 --> 29:07.780
What are you doing?

29:07.800 --> 29:11.620
I warned you not to do this!

29:11.630 --> 29:15.050
Actually, i didn't know
diana when she was alive.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.760
But i've talked to her recently.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.350
I see earthbound spirits.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.450
That's how i know that diana's here.

29:27.460 --> 29:31.330
I came here because she's not at peace,
and there's a reason why she can't move on.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.060
I don't understand. Is
this some kind of joke?

29:34.070 --> 29:37.770
No, this is... It's very real.

29:37.780 --> 29:40.160
Diana's been trying to
protect you from something,

29:40.170 --> 29:43.160
But i think it's something you should know,
because it's going to come out eventually.

29:43.170 --> 29:44.990
You have no right to do this!

29:45.010 --> 29:47.310
Who do you think you are?

29:47.610 --> 29:50.740
I spoke to a nurse at mercy
hospital, dorothy perry.

29:50.750 --> 29:55.730
She was there the day that diana
died, and the day that she was born.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.700
The same day that
olivia keller was born.

29:58.710 --> 30:00.690
Stop it! Stop!

30:02.150 --> 30:05.650
Why is this suddenly coming out now?

30:08.190 --> 30:10.900
Who told you about all this?

30:10.910 --> 30:13.080
You know what i'm talking about?

30:13.090 --> 30:16.260
Mmm, i have a pretty good feeling.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.240
What?

30:17.250 --> 30:19.820
How did you find out?

30:19.830 --> 30:24.990
I saw a blood panel from the ankle
surgery she had when she was 8.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.470
Is that when you realized the truth?

30:28.480 --> 30:30.980
No, it was long before that.

30:30.990 --> 30:34.470
I've known diana wasn't mine
almost as long as i've had her.

30:34.490 --> 30:37.970
That's impossible. You
never said anything.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.830
Please.

30:43.650 --> 30:48.570
I had a long labor,
and so did lisa keller.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.930
We met walking the halls,
passing the time together,

30:52.940 --> 30:55.830
waiting for it to happen.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.970
Both having girls, excited.

30:58.980 --> 31:02.540
And we just became friends.

31:02.550 --> 31:05.330
There's so much joy.

31:05.340 --> 31:08.120
And then what happened?

31:09.210 --> 31:13.170
Then i brought diana home,
and something felt off.

31:13.200 --> 31:18.620
Everybody thought it was post-partum
depression, and at first, so did i.

31:18.630 --> 31:22.000
I mean, i love my little girl.

31:22.010 --> 31:25.910
But that feeling didn't go away.

31:27.060 --> 31:31.320
So, when did you suspect
that diana wasn't your baby?

31:31.330 --> 31:35.100
As they started to grow older,
i started to notice similarities

31:35.110 --> 31:39.830
Between me and olivia that
i didn't notice with diana.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.270
When she played tennis,
she played like me.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.150
She had my mother's eyes.

31:44.180 --> 31:50.140
And sometimes, when i looked at her and she
smiled, i felt like i was looking at a mirror.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.720
What about when you looked at me?

31:54.290 --> 31:56.530
Did you contact lisa keller?

31:56.540 --> 31:59.260
Not until the pre-surgery
blood work confirmed it.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.120
That's when i called lisa.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.430
How did she react?

32:04.440 --> 32:05.840
She didn't believe it.

32:05.850 --> 32:07.930
Refused to have olivia tested.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.240
She cut off all contact.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.800
They moved to texas.

32:11.820 --> 32:14.520
She said it was for kevin's job.

32:14.530 --> 32:17.580
She was running away from
the uncomfortable truth.

32:17.590 --> 32:22.080
So my own mother didn't want me,
and you couldn't get rid of me?

32:22.090 --> 32:24.370
- Let her explain.
- She already has.

32:24.380 --> 32:29.170
And if they loved the two of us so little,
then they won't miss us when we're both gone!

32:31.690 --> 32:33.890
What's going
on?Is, uh, diana--

32:33.900 --> 32:37.230
we need to go see
olivia before diana does.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.520
Diana, stop it!

33:46.790 --> 33:49.820
Why are you doing this?

34:03.110 --> 34:05.680
What is that?

34:09.159 --> 34:12.440
What do you want from me, diana?

34:45.739 --> 34:47.800
- Mrs. Keller?
- Yes?

34:47.810 --> 34:49.219
My name is melinda gordon.

34:49.230 --> 34:51.380
Is your daughter home?

34:51.389 --> 34:54.070
What is this about?

34:54.080 --> 34:57.110
Trust her, lisa. This is important.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.560
Oh, my god! What happened?

35:06.240 --> 35:09.300
Who-- who did all
of this? Livvy?

35:09.310 --> 35:11.510
Sweetie? Olivia?

35:15.330 --> 35:18.120
Her backpack is not here.

35:18.900 --> 35:22.630
Or her cell phone, clothes, laptop.

35:25.970 --> 35:28.890
Oh, my god! What did you do?

35:29.400 --> 35:31.350
Did you tell olivia?

35:31.360 --> 35:32.310
No.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.350
Then how did she know about these?

35:33.370 --> 35:35.230
How did she know to even look for these?

35:35.240 --> 35:38.170
Diana must have led her to them.

35:38.180 --> 35:38.980
What?

35:38.990 --> 35:42.320
These are all letters
from diana to olivia.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.350
And she thought i never wrote her back.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.390
Her mom must have kept them from her.

35:50.030 --> 35:52.610
You kept these from olivia?

35:52.620 --> 35:54.210
My god, lisa.

35:54.220 --> 35:59.790
Are you so selfish that you wouldn't
even let our daughters be friends?

36:02.330 --> 36:03.680
Diana's baby bracelet.

36:03.700 --> 36:09.080
I sent this to lisa, trying one
last time after i told her the truth.

36:09.090 --> 36:10.440
And now olivia knows the truth.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.430
I have to find her, i
have to call the police!

36:12.440 --> 36:15.700
No, you don't. You know where
she is, don't you? Please.

36:15.710 --> 36:18.150
Olivia needs your help.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.020
Sweetheart!

36:37.870 --> 36:39.450
Oh, i'm so glad we found you!

36:39.460 --> 36:40.400
Stay away from me.

36:40.420 --> 36:43.360
I understand why you're angry,
but, olivia, you have to know that--

36:43.370 --> 36:46.750
what?What you knew for the last 8 years?

36:46.780 --> 36:49.130
I found the letter.

36:49.850 --> 36:54.960
Dear lisa, i wanted you to have
something of your daughter, diana.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.510
Olivia...

36:58.520 --> 37:00.480
Don't talk to me, i
can't hear any more lies!

37:00.500 --> 37:03.130
Olivia, don't. Don't talk
to your mother that way.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.700
My mother? And who are you?

37:06.030 --> 37:10.710
The woman who gave birth to me let me
play in their house and then let me go?

37:11.230 --> 37:14.730
And not just somebody else's house,
but halfway across the country.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.820
Were you relieved when we moved?

37:16.830 --> 37:20.730
Did the two of you work
all of that out together?

37:21.720 --> 37:23.740
She tried.

37:23.750 --> 37:27.780
When she found out the truth, she
tried to talk to me, but, olivia,

37:27.800 --> 37:32.430
You were my daughter and so was
diana, and i couldn't lose you both!

37:32.440 --> 37:35.020
Both, what do you mean?

37:35.470 --> 37:39.580
Well, from the time they could walk,
they would follow you everywhere.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.350
Puppet shows, games, sports.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.300
Kids love you.

37:45.310 --> 37:48.230
What if they had to choose?

37:48.880 --> 37:51.760
They would both choose you.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.120
Lisa, look at your daughter.

37:54.130 --> 37:57.060
Your daughter olivia.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.740
As much as it kills me to say that.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.210
Why do you think she's so angry?

38:02.220 --> 38:04.300
It's not because you kept this from her.

38:04.310 --> 38:06.800
She thinks this means
that you don't love her,

38:06.820 --> 38:11.460
And there's nothing more in the
world that she wants than your love.

38:12.130 --> 38:16.750
Well, i always thought there was nothing
more in the world i wanted than hers.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.730
And then...

38:18.740 --> 38:23.680
You called me that
day, and i wanted more.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.960
Whenever i looked at either one of them.

38:29.970 --> 38:33.330
Olivia, you are my little girl.

38:33.350 --> 38:36.280
Nothing can change that.

38:38.770 --> 38:44.040
But diana, her hands, her eyes,

38:44.050 --> 38:47.740
the way she walked--
she was mine, too.

38:51.590 --> 38:55.920
I'm sorry that i tore
our daughters apart.

38:55.940 --> 38:59.200
I'm sorry that i abandoned both of you.

38:59.210 --> 39:02.960
How could you not want
both of them? I know i did.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.750
I don't want them to hurt anymore.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.990
Diana wants to forgive you.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.770
Wait, diana's here?

39:16.790 --> 39:17.650
That's how we found you.

39:17.670 --> 39:21.470
She told me that you guys
used to play here together.

39:21.480 --> 39:26.130
Tell olivia that i did
make new friends, but...

39:27.410 --> 39:29.280
There were none like her.

39:29.290 --> 39:32.520
She wants you to know
that she missed you.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.570
There was no one like you.

39:34.580 --> 39:38.360
I missed her, too. I still do.

39:41.140 --> 39:45.090
Sweetheart, we're going to sit down,
we're going to talk all of this through.

39:45.110 --> 39:48.490
We'll figure out where
to go from here...

39:48.500 --> 39:51.070
Together.

39:55.390 --> 39:58.510
She's saying good-bye.

40:03.430 --> 40:05.180
Will she be ok?

40:05.190 --> 40:08.910
She wants to know if you're
going to be all right without her.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.030
I'm not going to lie to you, sweet girl.

40:15.050 --> 40:17.520
Nothing is ever going to be the same.

40:17.530 --> 40:22.360
Remember what you used to
tell me when i had a bad day

40:22.370 --> 40:25.710
or i didn't do well?

40:25.720 --> 40:30.710
You would always say that the
only thing that mattered to you

40:30.720 --> 40:33.820
is that you knew i tried my best.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.350
That's what i need you to do.

40:36.370 --> 40:40.190
I need you to try to be ok.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.070
For me.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.840
She wants you to try.

40:47.230 --> 40:50.900
Just like you used to tell her to do.

40:53.070 --> 40:55.730
She needs you to promise
that you'll at least try.

40:58.390 --> 41:01.710
I will, sweet girl.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.860
I'll try.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.600
She's gone.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.670
Thank you.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.270
Long day?

42:08.430 --> 42:10.310
The longest.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.910
Do you want to talk about it?

42:16.740 --> 42:19.000
When i...

42:19.020 --> 42:24.740
Saw those two mothers love daughters
that weren't even really theirs,

42:24.770 --> 42:27.510
it just made me realize...

42:30.810 --> 42:33.840
If we can't do this...

42:37.330 --> 42:40.200
If we can't have a baby, would...

42:40.970 --> 42:44.370
Would you consider adoption?

42:44.380 --> 42:46.930
Absolutely.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.740
I really...

42:51.760 --> 42:54.670
Needed to hear you say that,
because the tests and the trying--

42:54.680 --> 42:57.910
But mel, look at this.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.190
Are these my results?

43:00.200 --> 43:02.020
Well, i did run into Dr. Chen today.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.160
Well, what is this prescription?

43:04.180 --> 43:05.620
It's for a hormone.

43:05.630 --> 43:08.650
It helps the embryo attach itself.

43:08.660 --> 43:10.330
It basically makes it feel more at home

43:10.350 --> 43:13.520
So it can settle and grow.

43:13.970 --> 43:16.640
- And this is all we need?
- Yeah.

43:19.180 --> 43:22.470
- So we're going to be able to have a baby?
- Yeah.
