information.

an Israeli effort

09:22.542 --> 09:24.583

09:24.583 --> 09:29.208

on the nuclear deal.

it's easy

09:50.083 --> 09:51.834

in this business.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.917

is it's not just a question

10:15.917 --> 10:18.250

or which sanctions.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.917
First and foremost,

could not be moved.

Carrie.
You know the Solicitor General.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.583
-Not personally.
-George Pallis,

29:58.583 --> 30:01.542
meet Carrie Mathison.
I haven't announced it yet,

30:01.542 --> 30:03.875
but George will be an important
part of my new administration,

30:03.875 --> 30:06.792
heading the
Justice Department.

30:06.792 --> 30:09.500
In a way,
we're just pulling that up.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.542
This is quite a situation
you've uncovered.

30:12.542 --> 30:13.959
Shall we?

30:13.959 --> 30:15.792
-Shouldn't we wait for Saul?
-He'll be in later.

30:15.792 --> 30:18.458
So, the, uh,
President-Elect told me

30:18.458 --> 30:22.625
about Dar's efforts to falsify
intelligence on Iran,

30:22.625 --> 30:25.500
plus his possible role
in the recent bombing.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.625
-More than possible.
-I agree,

30:27.625 --> 30:29.542
and to be clear,
the accusation frightens me

30:29.542 --> 30:32.959
because I agree.

30:32.959 --> 30:34.667
But as a legal
proposition,

30:34.667 --> 30:37.500
we need to understand,

30:37.500 --> 30:39.083
there's not a judge
in this country

30:39.083 --> 30:41.708
who would allow a prosecution
against Dar Adal

30:41.708 --> 30:45.291
to proceed
on this evidence.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.166
We have a videotaped
confession.

30:47.166 --> 30:48.667
Yes, of a foreign agent
who names Mossad,

30:48.667 --> 30:51.041
and that under torture.

30:51.041 --> 30:53.959
We also have photos
of an unnamed third party

30:53.959 --> 30:56.083
in the presence
of some white vans.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.125
And we have
an FBI agent dead,

30:58.125 --> 31:00.542
we believe at the hands
of this same third party,

31:00.542 --> 31:02.500
but we don't know.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.792
Am I missing something?

31:08.708 --> 31:12.667
So, what's the plan?

31:12.667 --> 31:14.959
In a word...

31:14.959 --> 31:15.834
You.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.875
A few weeks ago,
you told Rob and me

31:17.875 --> 31:21.041
about a situation
in the Berlin station.

31:21.041 --> 31:25.291
Dar covered up a serious breach
by a Russian mole.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.417
He lied in his reports
to Congress.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.875
That's prosecutable
under the Espionage Act.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.208
Okay, I really think
that we need to bring Saul

31:31.208 --> 31:34.625
-into this conversation.
-You said you were willing

31:34.625 --> 31:36.959
-to make a statement.
-I also said I was uneasy

31:36.959 --> 31:39.834
about doing that, because it
would be a problem for Saul.

31:39.834 --> 31:43.417
And I'm more uneasy now.
We all should be.

31:43.417 --> 31:45.000
I didn't uncover this,
Saul did.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.208
He took it upon himself
to travel off-book

31:48.208 --> 31:49.708
to the occupied territories

31:49.708 --> 31:52.041
to meet with an asset
he placed years ago.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.208
That's the only reason
any of us is here.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.834
It's the only reason
we're not just being steamrolled

31:55.834 --> 31:58.542
by Dar and his fucking cabal.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.667
Excuse me.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.208
Carrie, I'm the newcomer here,

32:03.208 --> 32:06.417
but I'm already certain.

32:06.417 --> 32:07.125
An affidavit from you

32:07.125 --> 32:11.125
about what happened in Berlin,

32:11.125 --> 32:13.625
that's how we get Dar.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.417
I'm gonna have
to talk to Saul.

32:20.417 --> 32:23.583
There will be a pardon for him,

32:23.583 --> 32:25.667
down the line.

32:28.959 --> 32:31.667
I still have
to talk to him.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.417
Your parking pass
is in the envelope,

32:36.417 --> 32:37.250
along with
the parking rules,

32:37.250 --> 32:39.625
which are, let's say,
complicated.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.750
Read them, or you'll get towed.
I'm not even kidding.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.291
-Okay.
-How's your commute?

32:44.291 --> 32:45.542
Not too bad.

32:45.542 --> 32:47.166
If you stay
at the Resident Suites,

32:47.166 --> 32:48.875
there's a corporate rate
and a pool.

32:48.875 --> 32:51.375
A lot of people
take advantage.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.959
Oh.

32:53.959 --> 32:57.125
[beep, door unlocks]

32:57.125 --> 32:59.333
[indistinct conversations]

32:59.333 --> 33:02.959
If you get lost,
you're Level 6, Area 3.

33:02.959 --> 33:04.959
What's OPC?

33:04.959 --> 33:06.166
No one seems to know.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.125
So, this is you.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.500
All good?

33:19.500 --> 33:23.000
Yeah, I-I guess.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.208
That him?

33:24.208 --> 33:25.959
Max, Trent.
Trent, Max.

33:25.959 --> 33:28.500
Let me know
if you need anything.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.166
Yeah.

33:32.792 --> 33:34.708
O'Keefe said
you're the man.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.834
Uh, depends on
what you mean.

33:37.834 --> 33:40.834
Well,
my network shit the bed.

33:40.834 --> 33:42.667
22,000 sock puppets gone,

33:42.667 --> 33:45.500
just when we've got
a big I/O push coming.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.166
That sound like
something you can handle?

33:48.166 --> 33:49.542
Show me.

34:02.583 --> 34:05.333
Carrie?

34:07.417 --> 34:09.208
I've been going over
the Nafisi tape,

34:09.208 --> 34:10.625
translating
the whole thing.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.542
It's true
he never mentions Dar directly,

34:12.542 --> 34:15.542
it's always Mossad, but there's
a lot of indirect reference

34:15.542 --> 34:18.250
to American involvement,
a lot.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.708
You hear anything
from Keane?

34:23.708 --> 34:26.708
Yeah. They, uh -- They brought
the Solicitor General onboard.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.583
Good.

34:28.583 --> 34:31.875
So when do we go in?

34:31.875 --> 34:34.792
Actually,
I just met with them.

34:34.792 --> 34:37.417
You did?

34:37.417 --> 34:40.500
What happened,
they lose my number?

34:42.834 --> 34:45.458
No, what happened is...

34:47.792 --> 34:50.000
The Solicitor General
says there's no evidence.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.583
[chuckles]
That's not true.

34:51.583 --> 34:53.291
Not enough to prosecute,
according to him.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.959
He says that the only way
to bring down Dar...

35:00.750 --> 35:03.417
...is by prosecuting
the breach in the Berlin station

35:03.417 --> 35:05.458
under the Espionage Act.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.834
[scoffs]

35:12.917 --> 35:16.250
You told them
about Berlin?

35:16.250 --> 35:19.917
Weeks ago. It was never
supposed to be used.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.166
It's about the cover-up, Saul,
and that's on Dar.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.166
He had the obligation to report
not only the security breach...

35:30.166 --> 35:32.250
-Oh, please.
-...but also leaving agents

35:32.250 --> 35:33.417
on the ground after

35:33.417 --> 35:35.750
-they had been compromised.
-Stop it. Stop it!

35:37.125 --> 35:40.667
Who cares
about a cover-up?

35:40.667 --> 35:43.375
The breach itself is me.
I was in the middle of it.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.542
I was the one
involved with the Russian spy.

35:47.542 --> 35:49.834
I know.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.792
Everything I've done,

35:51.792 --> 35:55.125
my entire career
will be wiped out.

35:55.125 --> 35:58.333
All anyone will remember
is that.

35:58.333 --> 36:01.959
Keane is not ungrateful.
She promised you a pardon.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.834
A pardon.

36:03.834 --> 36:04.792
It's not nothing.

36:04.792 --> 36:07.667
What about the Agency?

36:10.333 --> 36:13.375
Well, the Agency
has survived worse.

36:13.375 --> 36:16.125
Not when the president
wants it gone, which Keane does.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.208
You're aware of that, right?

36:20.542 --> 36:22.959
Don't look away,
God damn it.

36:22.959 --> 36:26.417
Answer me.
Say something.

36:26.417 --> 36:32.208
Maybe you shouldn't have been
fucking a Russian mole.

36:32.208 --> 36:35.834
Well, coming from someone who
fucked a guy in a suicide vest,

36:35.834 --> 36:38.208
that means a lot.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.291
[cellphone ringing]

36:47.542 --> 36:50.041
Just answer
the damn thing.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.959
-Hello?
-Carrie Mathison?

36:53.959 --> 36:56.041
-Yes.
-Hi.

36:56.041 --> 36:57.959
This is Maria
at Child Services.

36:57.959 --> 37:00.417
You've been approved
for a visit with your daughter

37:00.417 --> 37:02.041
tomorrow at our offices.

37:02.041 --> 37:04.542
Do you know
where that is?

37:04.542 --> 37:04.917
I do.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.417
At 3 p.m.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.875
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.458
You're very welcome,
Ms. Mathison.

37:11.458 --> 37:12.500
Uh, we'll see you
tomorrow.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.166
Dar's here.

37:35.166 --> 37:36.708
He's in the building.

37:36.708 --> 37:37.917
[sighs]

37:37.917 --> 37:40.625
Not too late to cancel.

37:40.625 --> 37:43.583
The meeting's
been scheduled.

37:43.583 --> 37:44.917
I can sub in for you.

37:44.917 --> 37:48.166
No. No changes.
I don't want to tip our hand.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.959
He is bringing me a list
of cabinet recommendations.

37:50.959 --> 37:51.917
George thinks
we'll get to see

37:51.917 --> 37:54.250
who some of Dar's
fellow travelers are.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.708
-That would be huge.
-Yeah,

37:57.708 --> 38:00.708
assuming I'm able to stand
being in the same room with him.

38:00.708 --> 38:02.542
[knock on door, door opens]

38:05.625 --> 38:06.917
Dar.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.667
Madame President-Elect.

38:08.667 --> 38:09.708
Can I get you
something to drink?

38:09.708 --> 38:12.750
[chuckling] It's still
a little early for me.

38:12.750 --> 38:13.792
What I have
is coffee or juice.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.792
Oh. Coffee.

38:16.792 --> 38:18.125
Light.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.959
Please have a seat.

38:19.959 --> 38:22.667
Thank you.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.291
I have to confess,
I'm not a complete stranger

38:24.291 --> 38:27.208
to something stronger
early in the day.

38:27.208 --> 38:28.417
Oh?

38:28.417 --> 38:31.333
[Keane] The toughest districts
always seem to have bars

38:31.333 --> 38:33.750
that open at 6 a.m.
when the night shift gets off.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.625
You want their vote,
you better be able

38:35.625 --> 38:38.834
to knock back a few
with breakfast.

38:38.834 --> 38:41.041
For us Arabists,
it's the tea.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.792
My first post,

38:43.792 --> 38:46.166
the local tribesmen
honored a guest

38:46.166 --> 38:49.375
by cleaning his teacup
with a gob of spit.

38:49.375 --> 38:54.625
If you rejected
the hospitality, well...

38:54.625 --> 38:56.625
Let's hope the service here
is better.

39:02.667 --> 39:06.083
Two days in a row for us.

39:06.083 --> 39:07.083
It's an honor
for me, ma'am.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.750
What do you think?

39:09.750 --> 39:13.875
Are we heading toward
a daily briefing?

39:13.875 --> 39:17.708
That will be
with the Director.

39:17.708 --> 39:20.625
I said nothing's
off the table.

39:30.125 --> 39:35.125
So, where are we?

39:35.125 --> 39:38.625
You said you had
some names for me.

39:43.708 --> 39:46.917
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

39:46.917 --> 39:49.875
Your son, Andrew.

39:49.875 --> 39:51.667
Yes.

39:52.875 --> 39:57.917
I can't help but think how proud
he'd be of you right now.

40:10.667 --> 40:11.959
[Max] Okay.

40:11.959 --> 40:14.708
So, I'm seeing Facebook
accounts, Instagram, Twitter...

40:14.708 --> 40:18.959
4chan, 8chan, fuckin' LinkedIn,
whatever. We're there.

40:18.959 --> 40:22.083
And this interface
masks your identity.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.667
It did until
it stopped working.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.375
Didn't O'Keefe
tell you anything?

40:26.375 --> 40:29.166
Not really, no.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.250
All right, look.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.458
So, these sock puppets
you're missing,

40:33.458 --> 40:35.834
they're just a bunch
of fake users

40:35.834 --> 40:38.792
with online lives
that you manage, right?

40:38.792 --> 40:40.792
I wouldn't say fake.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.417
What is it?

40:48.417 --> 40:51.750
Just a second.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.375
-What is it?
-Just wait.

40:55.375 --> 40:56.625
Okay, so the system here

40:56.625 --> 40:58.458
uses dynamic proxies
to mask your location,

40:58.458 --> 41:01.291
but there's a conflict
with the firewall.

41:01.291 --> 41:04.667
I put in a workaround,
so...

41:04.667 --> 41:07.375
Um, do any of these
ring a bell?

Um, SemperFucked?

-Shoot.
-Did I do anything,
