Well, where you
planning on going?

Mexico. To see
<i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi.</i>

21:06.300 --> 21:07.300
(sighs)

21:08.430 --> 21:10.390
Did you know if you
stay over a Sunday night,

21:10.390 --> 21:13.390
you can get two round trip
tickets for only $600?

21:13.770 --> 21:16.980
Okay well, that's $600
I don't have.

21:16.980 --> 21:18.150
Well, I do!

21:19.690 --> 21:21.650
You have $600?

21:23.570 --> 21:25.030
What'd you do?
Knock off a liquor store?

21:25.030 --> 21:27.110
No!
I found it.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.910
You found $600?

21:29.910 --> 21:32.200
$940, actually.

In the back of one of
Rafa's drawers rolled up

21:36.420 --> 21:38.000
Val, that's not your money.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.080
Yes it is.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.420
Of course it is.
I found it.

21:41.420 --> 21:43.960
Obviously <i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi</i>
left it there for safe keeping.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.880
And we can use that money
for other things.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.640
But two minutes ago,
you didn't even
know about it!

21:48.640 --> 21:51.600
Right, but now that I do,
you're not going to
blow it all on vacation!

21:51.600 --> 21:53.640
Visiting our parents
is not a vacation.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.730
It's not a necessity!

21:54.730 --> 21:55.890
It is for me.

Jorge said a customer called.

Did you ask everybody else

23:18.680 --> 23:19.350
Okay?

What are you doin'?

I deserve respect.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.540
And without that,

23:37.540 --> 23:39.160
you can have your money

23:39.160 --> 23:41.000

have your job.

Alright? Luce, can you
please check on her?

Really, you're
asking her?

‐Pfft. Why not me?
‐Well, let's be honest.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.920
You're not exactly great
at follow through. Are you?

25:51.920 --> 25:53.710
Beto, don't start.
Not now.

25:53.710 --> 25:54.920

25:54.920 --> 25:56.050
All:
Nothing! Nothing!

25:56.930 --> 25:59.600
Um, really look, guys.
It's nothing. Actually,
you know what?

25:59.600 --> 26:01.720
I'm getting a call
from the restaurant.
Can I call you guys back?

disappointed that
I said no

26:12.360 --> 26:14.190
to her taking
a trip to Mexico
by herself.

26:14.190 --> 26:16.280
‐Give it a rest, okay?!
‐No, no.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.030
As somebody who's
been recently screwed over

26:18.030 --> 26:20.410
‐by a member of this family
let me just say‐‐
‐Go to hell, Emilio!

26:20.410 --> 26:22.660
‐Okay you know what? That's it.
‐Beto! Do you wanna know
what happened?!

26:22.660 --> 26:26.660
‐Because I can explain.
‐Really? You have a good
excuse for screwing me over?

26:26.660 --> 26:28.830
All I asked was for you
to help me study.

26:28.830 --> 26:30.920
I didn't ask you
to give me the answers.
That was your idea.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.710
‐And I swear Bey,
I wrote them down. See?
‐No.

26:33.710 --> 26:36.420
‐Only Olivia cornered me‐‐
‐No. What difference
does it make?!

26:37.340 --> 26:39.340
You didn't show up,
and I failed.

26:39.340 --> 26:41.390
Maybe you didn't?
Maybe you did better
than you think.

26:41.390 --> 26:42.850
I may be dumb,

26:43.260 --> 26:45.060
but I'm not dumb enough
to think I did well.

26:45.060 --> 26:46.520
You're not dumb.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.100
I don't get things.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.070
And it may be easy for you,
but seriously something...

26:54.860 --> 26:56.030
something's wrong with me.

26:57.070 --> 26:58.780
Because I sit in that
physics class

26:58.780 --> 27:00.320
and it's like somebody's
speaking a foreign language,

27:00.320 --> 27:01.780
which might as well
be god damned Spanish

27:01.780 --> 27:03.620
cause I don't understand
much of that either.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.700
I'm in trouble.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.960
Only now, it's
everyone's problem,

27:07.960 --> 27:10.580
cause if I can't cut it
academically, they'll be
on all of our asses.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.210
That just makes the pressure
a thousand million times worse.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.420
But you know what?

27:17.460 --> 27:18.840
Last night, I actually slept.

27:20.470 --> 27:22.680
Even with Val's elbow
in my ribs.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.260
I slept.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.140
Because my really smart sister
was gonna give me the answers.

27:37.110 --> 27:38.320
(knocking)

27:38.940 --> 27:40.360
Go away.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.000
You weren't gonna
bring that up to them.

27:50.910 --> 27:51.580
We agreed.

27:53.790 --> 27:55.420
You don't think
they're upset enough?

27:55.420 --> 27:57.710
(muffled):
They wouldn't be
if you'd let me visit them.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.220
If it's their money,
then they get to decide.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760

28:08.470 --> 28:09.310
I spent it.

28:09.930 --> 28:11.230

28:11.230 --> 28:12.230
Well, I owed Osc‐‐

28:12.980 --> 28:15.480

some back pay.

28:16.610 --> 28:17.940
You're still gonna
see them at Easter.

28:18.530 --> 28:22.030
Okay? You, Beto,
Lucía, Rafa...

28:22.030 --> 28:23.030

Do you think it's
possible that

28:34.580 --> 28:37.250

because I prayed
for a miracle?

28:38.170 --> 28:39.500

29:34.850 --> 29:37.310
Val was desperate
to come see you next week.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.310
And I told her no.

29:40.190 --> 29:41.730
That's why she
was so mad at me.

29:42.730 --> 29:45.030
She found some money
in one of Rafa's drawers.

29:45.030 --> 29:45.860
Some cash.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.410
And she was planning on
using that money

29:48.410 --> 29:50.410
to buy a plane ticket.
What?

29:51.540 --> 29:54.200
<i>I totally forgot.</i>
<i>I knew I tucked it</i>
<i>away somewhere</i>

29:54.200 --> 29:56.420

29:57.370 --> 29:58.630
<i>Thank God you find it.</i>

29:59.380 --> 30:00.960

30:00.960 --> 30:02.630
<i>However you see fit. Okay?</i>

30:04.380 --> 30:07.010
But, why wasn't that
money in the coffee can
in the kitchen?

30:07.720 --> 30:09.090
Why was it hidden?

30:09.680 --> 30:11.010
Where'd that money come from?

30:12.930 --> 30:13.810
<i>Mami?</i>

30:16.100 --> 30:17.850
Your <i>papi</i> , he...

30:18.400 --> 30:20.230
He always has
so much on his mind,

30:20.230 --> 30:21.860
so many big worries that,

30:22.270 --> 30:24.110
sometimes, he
doesn't keep track.

30:24.650 --> 30:25.820
Of little things.

30:26.740 --> 30:30.200
Small difficulties are solved
with a little money and...

30:32.280 --> 30:34.160
There was all that cash
at the end of the night

30:34.160 --> 30:35.950
swept up into
the bank drop that,

30:35.950 --> 30:38.620
very occasionally, when I
was there helping to close up,

30:38.620 --> 30:42.630
I‐‐ I would
take a ten...

30:46.090 --> 30:47.010

<i>Just a little here and there</i>

30:50.970 --> 30:52.050

30:53.470 --> 30:54.350
Why?

30:55.600 --> 30:57.770
I mean, what were
you saving it for that
you couldn't tell <i>Papi?</i>

31:01.020 --> 31:02.020
You, Emilio.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.650
I was saving it for you.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.160
<i>Remember all those visits</i>
<i>that we hug you goodbye</i>

31:10.160 --> 31:13.410
and I would slip a little
something into your
shirt pocket. Hmm?

31:15.120 --> 31:16.700
<i>That was for your rent.</i>

31:16.700 --> 31:19.790
<i>That</i> Papi <i>thought</i>

<i>for you to pay</i>

31:19.790 --> 31:21.210
<i>because you could have</i>
<i>been living with us.</i>

31:21.210 --> 31:23.090

31:23.090 --> 31:25.500

That one with the‐‐

31:31.760 --> 31:33.300

31:35.600 --> 31:36.850
My Stratocaster.

31:38.270 --> 31:40.270
You loved that thing so much,
I couldn't bear the thought

31:40.270 --> 31:42.400
of it belonging to
anyone else but you.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.360
So I gave you the money
to buy it back.

31:49.190 --> 31:50.240
(door knocking)

31:51.490 --> 31:52.570
Ms. Mateluna.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.370
Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you,

31:54.370 --> 31:56.910
I‐I'm here to talk to you
about my brother's test...

31:57.790 --> 32:00.210
(laughs)
This isn't...

32:00.210 --> 32:02.040
We can talk on
the other side
of the weekend.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.460
You can't fail him.

32:04.170 --> 32:06.130
I‐I haven't even
graded the test yet.

32:06.130 --> 32:07.170
He knows he failed.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.130
Which means there is
no way he can pass the class.

32:10.130 --> 32:12.680
Which means he won't
be able to work at
the restaurant

32:12.680 --> 32:14.590
or help take care
of our baby brother‐‐

32:14.590 --> 32:15.680
He should have
thought of that

32:15.680 --> 32:17.350
before he took the
exam. Not after.

32:17.350 --> 32:18.720
But he did think of it.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.430
And he asked me to
help him study and I...

32:22.190 --> 32:23.150
let him down.

32:24.230 --> 32:25.150
It's my fault.

32:26.190 --> 32:27.730
But the consequences
of his failing,

32:28.230 --> 32:29.570
they're all of ours
to deal with.

32:29.570 --> 32:30.400
The whole family.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.200
Let me understand,
are you asking me

32:33.200 --> 32:34.530
to give him a grade
he doesn't deserve?

32:35.530 --> 32:37.280
To pass him when
he did failing work?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.620
To be honest,

32:39.620 --> 32:41.580
how well my brother
understands physics

32:41.580 --> 32:44.170
has very little to do
with the rest of his life.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.590
What has everything
to do with it is...

32:47.590 --> 32:52.130
how well he‐‐
we can keep
our family together.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.680
The world hasn't been
very kind to us lately.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.470
And...

33:00.470 --> 33:03.770
it'd be nice if someone could
show Beto a little forgiveness.

33:06.270 --> 33:08.060
Actions have
consequences, Lucía.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.530
And even if I can't teach
your brother physics,
I can teach him that.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.950
Some of us do things
as they are supposed to be done.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.070
We take time.
We do the work.

33:18.410 --> 33:20.910

your parents did
put you at risk.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.210

33:34.260 --> 33:36.300

33:36.300 --> 33:37.470
