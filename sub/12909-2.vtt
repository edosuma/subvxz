WEBVTT

00:03.719 --> 00:05.230
- What have we got, then?
- Suicide.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.310
I don't think he jumped,
sir. He was pushed.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.470
Why did you want to be a policeman?

00:09.520 --> 00:13.350
I don't want to be a policeman.
I want to be a detective.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.270
- Two people are dead.
- I might be coming to London.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.720
- Which station?
- Canary Wharf. He'll be there.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.430
You supporting someone, or are you here to have fun?
- She's with me.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.310
I came second. You came third.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.950
I'd have come first if
you hadn't got in my way.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.110
No!

00:31.160 --> 00:33.390
David Leese is taking
backhanders. He must be.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.030
UK Remicon are bribing him.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.870
Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.630
I have three teams working on this.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.190
You think I'll risk it all for
your Batman and Robin antics?

00:42.240 --> 00:44.550
- UK Remicon, they're criminals.
- They're protected.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.110
They have some very powerful
friends in government.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.510
The trouble with the Serious Fraud Office

00:49.560 --> 00:53.390
is that once they get
started, they don't stop.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.310
You're in government. Can't you stop it?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.350
I don't want to drown no more

00:58.400 --> 01:00.550
I'm sick of the same old people

01:00.600 --> 01:02.910
The kind that'll sell your soul

01:02.960 --> 01:04.989
Trade it for a shining stone

01:05.040 --> 01:07.310
Ain't nothing in this life for free

01:07.360 --> 01:10.110
Running from the greatest evil

01:10.160 --> 01:12.270
It finally dawned on me

01:12.320 --> 01:14.990
A man's got to fight temptation

01:15.040 --> 01:18.830
Keep the wolves from the door

01:18.880 --> 01:23.150
I hear them scratching
like I don't know better

01:23.200 --> 01:28.510
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?

01:28.560 --> 01:33.400
It won't be long before I
cave in and open up the door.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.590
The pharmaceutical industry,

01:40.640 --> 01:45.840
a force for good, or a corrupt
multibillion-pound profit machine?

01:46.960 --> 01:50.510
With the NHS spending £15 billion
a year on prescription drugs,

01:50.560 --> 01:53.750
urgent questions are being asked
about the business practises

01:53.800 --> 01:56.830
of the world's biggest
pharmaceutical giants.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.750
We're going live now to Westminster,

01:58.800 --> 02:01.550
where the Commons' Select
Committee, set up to investigate,

02:01.600 --> 02:05.080
are interviewing senior
government advisor Peter Mayhew.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.389
You authorised the
multimillion-pound purchase

02:09.440 --> 02:11.350
of an anti-obesity drug, Lipocite.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.830
Not personally, no. My
role is only to advise.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.910
But you advised that it was effective.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.910
All the evidence suggests that it is.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.830
But it's also three times the
price of other drugs on the market.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.670
A simpler, cheaper product is available

02:26.720 --> 02:28.550
from Ruhn Laboratories, for example.

02:28.600 --> 02:32.590
Wouldn't it make more sense for
them to be supplying the NHS?

02:32.640 --> 02:35.310
Well, Ruhn Laboratories
are an American firm,

02:35.360 --> 02:38.270
whereas Lipocite is made
by a British company.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.310
UK Remicon.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.910
I think we should be proud
that we're supporting them.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.060
Lipocite acts on the
brain. Is that correct?

02:47.480 --> 02:48.950
As I understand, yes.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.430
Is it dangerous? Does it
have any side-effects?

02:52.480 --> 02:55.350
It's been through all the usual trials.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.740
That's not what I asked.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, there have been no negative results.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074

03:14.920 --> 03:16.640
Oh! Henry!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.560
What is it?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.670
There was an accident.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.030
- A girl.
- Where? What happened?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.960
At the station.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.550
S-S-She fell.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.200
Was she hurt?

03:47.240 --> 03:49.150
I ran away, Mum.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.510
Henry, what have you done?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.790
Is there something you need to tell me?

03:53.840 --> 03:57.240
You don't need to be
afraid. I'll look after you.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.310
In travel news, Canary Wharf
station has been closed

04:03.360 --> 04:05.910
by the police after a passenger fatality.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.110
All other stations and lines
are operating a good service.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.880
Where is he?!

04:22.520 --> 04:25.270
So, what have you got to say for yourself?
- I was too late.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.430
What are you talking about? Why
did you go back to the school?

04:28.480 --> 04:30.750
- Well, I wanted to see her.
- So you chased her here

04:30.800 --> 04:33.190
and she tripped on the
escalators and broke her neck.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.390
- That's not what happened.
- So, what did happen?

04:35.440 --> 04:38.270
It can't have been an accident.
She was killed, she was murdered.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.750
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Like Mark Henson and Steve Mullen.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.830
- Steve Mullen?
- He was in the photograph.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.750
He was with them in India.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.470
What do you think this is,
some kind of conspiracy?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.910
The only conspiracy is what
you're doing in this job!

04:50.960 --> 04:52.800
Just go home!

05:10.160 --> 05:12.070
And what is this?! This stain up there?!

05:12.120 --> 05:14.870
How is it possible to
get a stain up there?!

05:14.920 --> 05:17.550
Assured shorthold tenancy!

05:17.600 --> 05:20.550
Don't you tell me about my
contract! I know my contract!

05:20.600 --> 05:22.750
Stefan, tell him!

05:22.800 --> 05:25.230
Ohhhhh! Good evening, Mr Menakis.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.470
- What's the problem?
- The problem? There are lots of problems!

05:28.520 --> 05:31.630
You're meant to give us 24
hours' notice before you show up.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.030
- He just walked in.
- Look at this place. It is my house.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.630
- It's a pigsty. I want you out!
- You can't do that.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.830
You can't threaten to put
up the rent one minute,

05:40.880 --> 05:42.110
then throw us out the next.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.430
- You're behind with the rent.
- No, we're not.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.350
We pay on the last day
of the month, every month.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.590
Not last month, not the month before.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.000
That... That's not true. Jan?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.990
You held back the rent?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.310
He didn't mend the toilet.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.070
Wha...? You didn't pay the rent?

06:06.120 --> 06:09.060
- I didn't pay the rent!
- Are you...?!

06:12.400 --> 06:15.430
You'll have it by tomorrow
lunchtime. I'll transfer it myself.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.680
Why should I believe you?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.910
All right. Lunchtime tomorrow.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.600
And I still don't want you
here! You have two weeks!

06:28.280 --> 06:30.150
She was a teacher.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.540
I only met her this morning.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.440
Mm-hm!

06:44.640 --> 06:46.910
They think it was my fault.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.790
- How can it be your fault?
- It's complicated.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.990
It's complicated, so they blame you?

06:52.040 --> 06:54.180
I've heard that before.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.020
Are you OK?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.240
Yeah. I'm fine.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.200
It's going to be fine.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.830
Look, this might not be
the right time, but, um...

07:19.880 --> 07:21.590
I've got something for you.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.710
I know you've been
thinking about moving out,

07:23.760 --> 07:26.100
so this might cheer you up.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.750
- It's a room in a flat.
- Yeah?

07:30.800 --> 07:34.150
Yep. There's a girl that works
at the hospital. Her name's Jo.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.390
She's really nice, she's
got a place in Wandsworth.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.540
Better move quickly, though.
Lots of people are interested.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.840
Thanks.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.310
Goodnight.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.470
Sayyad! How you settling in?

09:03.520 --> 09:06.310
First day, just the one dead witness.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.710
Let's see, er... where we are by
the end of the week, shall we?

09:09.760 --> 09:14.310
Guv, I...
- No, no. It's probably best you don't say too much right now.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.300
Derek, why don't you take me through it?

09:17.720 --> 09:20.430
Laura Jones knows Mark Henson. All right?

09:20.480 --> 09:21.910
They go on holiday together.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.830
Wonder Boy here wanted to
know a bit more about that,

09:24.880 --> 09:26.790
so he decides to go back to the school.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.390
Hm. And what happened?

09:28.440 --> 09:31.070
We don't know. She got nervy,
fell down the escalators.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.710
Er... she didn't fall. She was pushed.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.630
That your opinion?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.710
- Have we got anything from Pathology?
- They're still working on it.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.910
What are we saying, then,
the two deaths are linked?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.950
- I'm not sure they are.
- They have to be!

09:45.000 --> 09:48.590
Look. This is Mark Henson,
this is Laura Jones.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.430
- When did you get that?
- Er... I saw it at the flat.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.870
Flaxton Court. I went back this morning.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.390
What, and you just took
it? You can't do that!

09:57.440 --> 10:01.320
You had it labelled and
entered in the evidence log?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.120
Yes, Guv.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.230
Go on.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.640
This is Mark Henson, Laura
Jones and this is Steve Mullen.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.870
I saw his picture in the
collision report from Luton.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.150
All three have been killed
in the last four weeks.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.550
You've been busy.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.190
That picture was taken in India.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.240
I think that's the Gate
of India in Mumbai.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.950
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.310
We've got some kind of serial
killer hitting teachers?

10:31.360 --> 10:32.870
I'm not saying anything, Derek.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.390
It makes no sense to me, either.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.190
What about this, er... CCTV
footage from Canary Wharf?

10:38.240 --> 10:39.870
Well, it won't be much help.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.830
It was switched off in the ticket office.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.640
- Who by?
- These two.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.230
They came in and it seems they made
straight for the main junction box.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.030
Contract workers. All right, who are
they? What were they doing there?

10:53.080 --> 10:54.820
We're on to it.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.760
That's where they pulled
out the power supply.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.990
I don't suppose you saw anything else?

11:03.040 --> 11:05.910
Oh, it was over by the time I arrived.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.590
All right. There are two other
people in this photograph.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.950
Assuming they haven't had their
necks broken or been run over,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.540
we should find out who they are.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.510
Right, then, genius, start with
Steve Mullen. Get his widow in here.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.430
Where'd you get this from?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.110
I saw it in Leese's office.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.070
Axis Hotel.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.260
Sponsored by UK Remicon.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.990
You should definitely make an appearance.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.350
Get a copy of this printed up
and use it at the front door.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.200
OK? You can go as David Leese.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.870
- Will it count as overtime?
- No. It's a party.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.630
- Then you go.
- I can't. I don't like parties.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.870
Everyone likes parties.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.320
That's why it's not overtime.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.750
Coleman. How nice to hear from you.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.070
I have another assignment.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.460
It's time to help the
police with their enquiries.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.960
Thank you for coming in today, Mrs Mullen.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.840
And with your baby.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.590
Have you found something? Do
you know who killed Stephen?

13:11.640 --> 13:14.230
Not... Not yet, no.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.150
We've just got a few questions for you.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.070
So, when did you move to Luton?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.390
Just after we got married.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.710
Five years ago. Dean's six months.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.680
He's lovely.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.710
Steve couldn't find any work
up in Leeds, so we came south.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.670
What job did he do?

13:35.720 --> 13:37.990
He worked at a nursery.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.110
Babies?

13:40.160 --> 13:41.720
Flowers.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.900
He was the manager.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.380
He was on his way home when it happened.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.240
Um... Jenny, can you tell
me anything about India?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.510
India?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.100
- Well, he went there.
- Yeah.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.340
He met some people out there, didn't he?

14:28.120 --> 14:32.430
Um... there were a group of them, I think.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.680
He never talked about it.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
You don't know anyone in this photograph?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.360
That's Steve.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.280
I, um... I don't know the others, though.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.470
Do you know how they met?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.000
No.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.640
But he got, um... He got paid for it.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.510
- He earned quite a bit of money.
- How much money?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.200
£600.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.470
He used some of it to buy this ring.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.120
What did he do to earn the money?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.960
I don't know.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.830
He didn't say.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.350
So, what do you do in India to earn £600?

15:29.400 --> 15:31.870
- I don't know.
- You don't know? That makes a change!

15:31.920 --> 15:33.950
It was a waste of time
bringing her in here.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.590
She knew nobody in that bloody photograph.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.590
If they knew Laura, if
they were still friends,

15:38.640 --> 15:41.510
then maybe they'll come to her funeral.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.840
That's possible.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.470
Have another word with Luton
Collision Unit investigators,

15:51.520 --> 15:55.120
- see if they've got anything else.
- Right, Sarge.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.540
And you may have to dig out a black tie.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.840
Good evening, Alison.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.510
- You frightened me!
- Oh.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.070
- What are you doing here?!
- Well, I came to see you.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.460
You could have let me know.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.830
I brought a rather pleasant Pouilly-Fume.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.020
Would you like a glass?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.390
Uncle Peter, I really don't think
you should just walk in here.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.590
- I know it's your flat...
- Oh, it's your flat, my dear.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.590
I'm glad to give you the use of it.

16:44.640 --> 16:48.110
I know how hard it is for
young professionals in London.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.680
House prices are ridiculous.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.560
What do you want?

16:55.480 --> 16:59.150
I just wondered if you had any
more news for me about UK Remicon.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.670
The situation is rather
fluid at the moment,

17:01.720 --> 17:04.069
so, er... I like to be informed.

17:04.119 --> 17:07.349
I'm trying, but I don't
like this, Uncle Peter.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.869
They'd fire me if they
knew I was talking to you.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.030
Hm! We're all on the same side, really.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.869
Successful British company, 37,000 jobs.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.910
- We wouldn't want to lose all that.
- I don't...

17:18.960 --> 17:22.260
Any more than you would
want to lose this flat.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.960
Cheers.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.190
Hi! Um... is that Jo?

17:31.240 --> 17:33.790
My name's Arrash. My sister,
Leila, gave me your number.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.750
She said you had a room.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.390
Er... yeah. Can I, um...
Can I come and see it?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.750
Er... tomorrow, 9:15.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.910
I finish work at 7:00, so that's perfect.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.240
I'll see you tomorrow night. Huh! OK.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.990
- Hi!
- Hey!

17:57.040 --> 17:58.760
Oh! Thanks.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.120
Um...

18:19.800 --> 18:22.470
So, what happened to your brother?

18:23.240 --> 18:26.830
What?
- You said he was coming with his girlfriend.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.710
Oh, yes. Er... he, um... he let
me down at the last minute.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.550
You don't mind, do you?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.440
No. Not at all.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.640
So, how did you get into the SFO?

18:41.880 --> 18:45.350
Well, I met Marcus and he hired me.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.590
Hm.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.710
You and Marcus, you're
always out of the office.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.830
What is it you do, exactly?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.110
Same as you.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.720
So, you're working on UK Remicon, then?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.030
Um...

19:02.080 --> 19:05.230
- Well, yeah.
- You were talking about a party.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.750
Yeah. I'm going tomorrow night.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.350
Why are you so interested?

19:10.400 --> 19:14.040
Huh! I'm interested in you.

19:15.920 --> 19:20.070
- Mm! Would you like another drink?
- Not really.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.790
Oh, go on. I've got another bottle.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.920
- No, no, I've got an early start.
- Oh, yeah, me, too.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.240
We could... get up together.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.160
Um...

19:45.880 --> 19:49.120
I'm really flattered, but,
you know, we work together.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.590
No... No offence.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.960
No.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.100
Look, thanks for dinner.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.600
Shit!

21:01.800 --> 21:04.960
- So, the funeral's tomorrow?
- Yes, Mr Blake.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.510
And you know what to do.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.870
Yes.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.710
I don't really understand.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.270
Let me be honest with you, Bruce.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.120
Sometimes, the less you know,
the better it is for you.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.980
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.910
When I first joined Ruhn Laboratories,

21:38.960 --> 21:42.230
we were working on a new cancer drug.

21:42.280 --> 21:46.430
It tackled chronic myeloid
leukaemia, and it worked.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.790
We covered all our research
costs in just two years.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.750
But that didn't stop us
charging patients 90,000 a year

21:54.800 --> 21:56.550
just to take the drug.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.110
And by the time I became
CEO here in the UK,

21:59.160 --> 22:01.990
we were earning 900 million a year.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.720
Pure profit.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.510
Now... Well, you tell me, Bruce...

22:08.560 --> 22:12.230
were we hurting those patients,

22:12.280 --> 22:14.560
or were we saving them?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.470
Do you believe in God, then?

22:29.520 --> 22:31.270
Er... not really.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.120
Are you a Muslim?

22:34.680 --> 22:35.870
I'm not anything.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.230
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.110
It's all crap, the whole lot of it.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.900
My condolences.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.120
Ahem!

22:47.480 --> 22:49.470
- Over there.
- What?

22:49.520 --> 22:51.520
From the photograph.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.190
Shall I tell you something, Sayyad?

22:57.240 --> 22:59.710
No-one likes anybody
who's right all the time.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.060
- You don't like me, anyway.
- Oh, that's true.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.030
We therefore commit Laura's
body to the ground.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.390
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.470
dust to dust.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.510
In the sure and certain hope

23:21.560 --> 23:24.300
of the resurrection to eternal life.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.980
Excuse me. I wonder if we
could have a word with you.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.910
I'm Detective Sergeant
Sands, this is DC Sayyad.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.670
- Is this about Laura?
- Well, yes.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.510
Unless you know anybody else here
who's fallen down the escalators,

24:02.560 --> 24:05.350
I'd say that was a fair assumption.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.910
Shall we go inside?

24:06.960 --> 24:10.360
Why?
- Just for a few minutes, so we can talk.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.580
Well, that seems to have worked.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.510
So, what's your name?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.430
Bruce Lockwood.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.480
Didn't you know that?

24:33.320 --> 24:36.510
If you don't know who I am,
why do you want to talk to me?

24:36.560 --> 24:39.830
Can you identify any of the
people in this photograph?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.990
That's Laura.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.310
Laura Jones.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.790
Mark Henson.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.640
Steve Mullen.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.680
They're all dead.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.110
Since when?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.300
In the last four weeks.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.110
Does that mean anything to you?

25:01.160 --> 25:02.300
No.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.620
- I hadn't seen them.
- Who's the other one?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.190
I don't know much about her.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.590
She went home. Somewhere in India,
I think. I never saw her again.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.390
What about Laura?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.710
How well did you know her?

25:17.280 --> 25:19.910
We all met in Mumbai.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.830
- In India.
- We know where Mumbai is!

25:24.400 --> 25:28.150
There were six of us. We
were travelling at the time.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.270
I only count five.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.320
The sixth was a man called Henry Williams.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.030
He's living in London.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.430
He wasn't part of the
group when this was taken.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.830
- Why not?
- None of us really got on with him.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.430
And then he got ill.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.430
Tell me about Mumbai.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.070
We were travellers. Students, backpackers.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.190
We didn't have any money and so
we answered this advertisement.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.230
There were always leaflets,

25:54.280 --> 25:56.910
hawkers in the street,
offering this sort of thing.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.430
- What sort of thing?
- Testing.

25:59.480 --> 26:03.390
It was an antidepressant
and they needed volunteers.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.980
So we all went to this hospital.

26:08.880 --> 26:13.470
So, you had this untested
drug injected into you?

26:13.520 --> 26:15.390
They said it was safe.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.870
And it was a respectable company.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.310
What were they called?

26:18.360 --> 26:19.830
Greenfern.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.750
It was run by a guy called David Leese.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.790
It was his name on the cheques.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.910
Any idea where we can find him?

26:28.960 --> 26:31.360
I think he works for the NHS.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.190
So, what happened?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.430
Nothing happened.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.270
We were there for 24 hours, they paid us,

26:46.320 --> 26:49.430
they made us sign confidentiality
clauses and we left.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.630
- Paid you how much?
- £600.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.710
I'm asking him, not you!

26:53.760 --> 26:56.500
He's right, that's how much it was.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.590
Did you all go back to Mumbai?

26:59.640 --> 27:00.870
No, not all of us.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.430
We never saw Henry again.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.670
But I didn't mind. He
was a weird guy, anyway.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.550
- Weird in what way?
- I think he'd been out there too long.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.390
A place like India, it does
your head in after a while.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.740
I'm going to need to take
your contact details.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.760
Thank you very much, Mr
Lockwood. We'll be in touch.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.710
Henry Williams. He was weird, he was ill.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.190
We need to find him.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.310
There must be a thousand
Henry Williams in London.

27:36.360 --> 27:39.790
OK, we'll start with the
man in charge, David Leese.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.430
We know he works for the NHS.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.080
He shouldn't be too hard to find.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.380
- Enjoy the party.
- Thank you.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.280
- Name?
- David Leese.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.600
Have a good evening, sir.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.280
He's here.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.430
Yes, um... my name's Detective
Constable Arrash Sayyad.

28:21.480 --> 28:23.150
I wonder if you can help me.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.200
I'm looking for a man called David Leese.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.110
Hello. I'm Gail Meadows.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.470
And I know the importance
of keeping myself in shape.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.710
But can you believe a year
ago, I looked like this?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.030
Yes, that's me.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.150
I tried everything, every fad
diet, but nothing worked.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.140
And then my doctor recommended Lipocite.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.880
I could bet all the
riches that I ever had

28:56.000 --> 29:00.840
Rushing the night like a
shark, babe, would it be bad

29:01.960 --> 29:07.880
If I had to set the alarm cos
of thrills that run up my back?

29:09.520 --> 29:14.120
You are my star Nothing
else can lead me off track

29:16.800 --> 29:20.150
It's a crime, if you don't want to

29:20.200 --> 29:23.750
You're the spy By the throat.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.430
'And I hope you have a
very enjoyable evening.'

29:26.480 --> 29:31.430
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen. My name is James Deakin.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.430
Don't worry, I'll keep this short.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.270
I know many of you have been
asking about our highly sought after

29:36.320 --> 29:38.110
training courses.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.350
As a matter of fact, we have
one coming up very soon in

29:40.400 --> 29:46.350
the south of France so please do ask
me or any of my staff about that.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.030
Above all, we want to
get to know you better.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.550
And finally, I'd like to
announce that, thanks to you,

29:52.600 --> 29:55.670
Lipocite has become our
most successful product ever.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
Have a great evening.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.670
Come on...

30:17.720 --> 30:19.120
Come on.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.920
Where are you? Where are you?

30:44.320 --> 30:47.190
Hey, can you tell Mum I
won't be home for dinner?

30:47.240 --> 30:48.550
I'm working late...

30:48.600 --> 30:51.230
- and then I'm seeing Jo.
- 'Who's Jo?'

30:51.280 --> 30:54.910
- Your friend, about the flat?
- 'Yeah, fine. Whatever.'

30:54.960 --> 30:57.160
- Yeah. Thanks.
- 'Bye.'

31:01.800 --> 31:04.000
I'm afraid he's not here.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.870
Do you know where I might find him?

31:06.920 --> 31:09.120
Who did you say you were?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.300
I'm the police.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.870
Er, Greenfern, have you heard of it?

31:20.920 --> 31:23.260
No. He's never mentioned it.

31:23.720 --> 31:24.750
In India?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.470
No.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.860
Look it's... It's important.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.470
He went to a party.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.670
It's at the Axis Hotel in the City.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.110
- I can call him if you like.
- Actually, I...

31:38.160 --> 31:40.670
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.880
Hi. I'm Lucy.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.060
Hi.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.080
Who are you?

31:50.960 --> 31:53.030
I'm David.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.590
I've never seen you at
one of these before.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.840
Yeah, it's my first time.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.990
So what happens?

32:01.040 --> 32:03.440
It's fun. You enjoy yourself.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.880
And if you get bored down here,
you can always go upstairs...?

32:09.600 --> 32:13.670
There are rooms, lots of rooms...

32:13.720 --> 32:16.080
if you want to lie down...?

32:22.680 --> 32:24.750
I'll see you around, David.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.400
Take it easy.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.640
You're empty.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.230
Thank you.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.190
Don't tell anyone, but this is Cristal.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.510
We've got a few glasses doing the rounds.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.900
Cheers.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.390
We've not met before.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.830
I work at the City of London Health Trust.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.070
Pharmacist?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.990
- That's right.
- So you know our products.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.510
Of course.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.440
Which ones in particular?

33:11.960 --> 33:14.030
Amoxicillin, Sumatriptan, Paroxetine,

33:14.080 --> 33:17.030
Gleamers toothpaste, Hexham's Fruit Juice.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.080
- That's just a few.
- That's very good.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.680
Have some more champagne.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.200
Thank you.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.900
I don't think you told me your name.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.480
It's...

33:50.880 --> 33:52.950
I asked you your name.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.190
It's, er...

34:01.240 --> 34:03.180
Are you feeling OK?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.440
Yeah.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.429
Well, it was nice to meet you.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.199
Have a great evening.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.400
Have a great evening.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.639
Who are you?

34:33.800 --> 34:37.920
'Lipocite works up here, in the
CB1 receptors in the brain.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.560
'Ask your doctor about Lipocite.'

35:06.520 --> 35:07.910
What's wrong with you?

35:07.960 --> 35:09.230
What?

35:10.240 --> 35:11.510
Jesus!

35:23.960 --> 35:25.230
Wh...?

35:26.880 --> 35:29.680
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.580
What exactly are you on?

35:33.120 --> 35:35.320
I don't know what I'm on.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.870
You must know. What...?

35:37.920 --> 35:40.480
What is it, ket? Crystal? GHB?

35:42.360 --> 35:44.070
Cristal.

35:44.120 --> 35:47.310
OK, er, did you snort or swallow?

35:47.360 --> 35:50.480
No. You don't understand.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.950
It was in the Cristal!

35:56.880 --> 35:58.830
OK...

35:58.880 --> 36:01.150
Just have some more juice.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.790
I don't... I don't feel very well.

36:12.680 --> 36:16.280
All right, well, you're not
going to be sick, are you?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.750
Oi.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.540
Tell me you're not going to be sick!

36:27.080 --> 36:30.830
Why did you have to do that?
That is disgusting, man.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.680
That's horrible.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.750
I know you!

36:34.800 --> 36:36.790
Look, I'm meant to be
going to someone's flat.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.350
I can't go like this.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.950
We've met.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.870
I've had enough of this, all
right? I'm getting you to hospital.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.350
Not hospital. Don't need it.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.670
Of course you need it.
Look at you. You're a mess.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.630
- YOU'RE a mess.
- Thanks to you.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.110
Not hospital. Don't
want to go to a hospital.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.230
OK. Where do you live?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.000
Er...

37:25.440 --> 37:26.640
Hey.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.200
Hey.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.480
How are you feeling?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.910
Bad.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.830
I'm not surprised.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.190
Where am I?

37:41.240 --> 37:43.150
Rash brought you home.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.190
Rash?

37:44.240 --> 37:46.180
Arrash. My brother.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.110
He's a police officer.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.070
- You're not serious.
- I am.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.840
Oh... God.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.670
Do you remember anything about last night?

38:05.720 --> 38:07.190
Not much.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.940
- Were you there?
- No.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.950
I looked after you when
I got back from my shift.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.310
I'm a nurse.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.230
- You were at the race.
- I was.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.910
You didn't win.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.560
Close second.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.470
- Do you know what you took?
- No.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.280
- And I didn't take it on purpose.
- Hm, haven't heard that one before.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.660
Would you like me to examine you?
- Yes!

38:36.240 --> 38:39.430
Y-yeah. Yeah.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.350
All right, we'll start with your pulse.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.710
Were you sick?

38:47.760 --> 38:49.550
I think so.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.510
Well, that's good.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.470
Your pupils aren't dilated.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.350
It's probably out of your system.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.910
You should see a doctor anyway.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.070
I'd prefer to see you.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.070
Seriously...

39:02.120 --> 39:04.460
you should get checked over.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.500
How's my pulse?

39:11.640 --> 39:13.240
It's racing.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.560
What's happening?

39:17.240 --> 39:19.580
I was just... checking him.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.030
All right. Is he well enough to leave?

39:23.080 --> 39:24.750
I'm all right.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.350
I'll leave you to it.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.150
I should get to bed.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.670
Thank you.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.100
You look after yourself.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.390
Here.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.230
That should be your size.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.550
What happened to this one?

39:58.080 --> 39:59.880
You tore it off.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.030
I'm Superman!

40:02.080 --> 40:04.830
You said you were Superman.
Or do you not remember that?

40:04.880 --> 40:06.220
No. No.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.700
Thanks.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.680
Don't mention it.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.380
You just ruined my evening.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.880
No, forget it, mate.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.000
I wasn't on drugs, if
it makes any difference.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.990
What?

40:29.800 --> 40:32.990
I know that's what it looks like,
but that's not how it happened.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.230
I was drugged.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.880
You're empty.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.520
- What? You mean...
- Someone spiked my drink.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.350
You can check me out if you like.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.140
I work for the Serious Fraud Office.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.830
Is that why you were there?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.670
At the hotel?

40:50.720 --> 40:52.790
I can't tell you that.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.800
Why not?

40:55.600 --> 40:57.550
You know I almost got
killed because of you.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.350
You're a police officer.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.270
Who told you that?

41:01.640 --> 41:03.240
Your sister.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.300
Look, I can't talk about
my work. I'm sorry. I can't.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.180
I'm Arrash.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.830
Arrash Sayyad.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.680
Stefan Kowolski.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.630
So why were you there?

41:25.680 --> 41:28.150
I can't tell you that, either.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.080
Then it looks like we don't
have much to talk about.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.040
You're right. We don't.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.110
Eleanor.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.230
Peter.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.630
This is a surprise.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.710
Is it?

41:53.760 --> 41:55.310
I just happened to be passing.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.950
You never just "happen" to
be doing anything, Peter.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.270
How can I help you?

41:59.320 --> 42:01.790
Well, it's none of my
business, but since you ask,

42:01.840 --> 42:04.590
I heard a whisper that you might
be interested in a company with

42:04.640 --> 42:06.110
which I have certain connections.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.510
UK Remicon?

42:07.560 --> 42:09.030
You're right.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.430
You're interested in them.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.820
It is none of your business.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.190
Well, of course, I wouldn't
dream of interfering.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.470
But I do hope you know what you're doing.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.350
It is my habit, yes.

42:22.400 --> 42:26.350
Then I'm sure you're aware
of UK Remicon's track record.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.110
They're a major player.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.990
An exporter, an employer.

42:30.040 --> 42:35.710
And, of course, we've got Ruhn
Laboratories, waiting in the wings.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.270
It'd be a shame to hand
everything to the Americans,

42:38.320 --> 42:39.870
- wouldn't it?
- Peter...

42:39.920 --> 42:42.950
Can I say something
with the upmost respect?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.190
Yes.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.710
Fuck off.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.310
So, you went to the funeral?

42:57.360 --> 42:58.830
Yes, sir.

42:59.720 --> 43:02.190
And the police were there?

43:02.240 --> 43:04.070
Yes. Two of them.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.630
One was a DS Sands.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.790
The other one was younger.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.870
DC Sayyad.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.640
And you managed to tell
them the things we mentioned?

43:14.360 --> 43:15.560
Yes.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.670
But...

43:18.720 --> 43:21.720
they said there were
two others who'd died.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.870
I know nothing about that.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.710
Look, why are we doing
this? Involving the police?

43:26.760 --> 43:28.150
Are you concerned?

43:28.200 --> 43:29.940
Yes, sir. I am.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.510
What we're doing, Bruce, is...

43:38.560 --> 43:41.430
exploiting a situation
that was handed to us.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.950
It was handed to us by you, and
we're very grateful for that.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.190
I know, but...

43:46.240 --> 43:49.310
UK Remicon's our number one
competitor in the European market

43:49.360 --> 43:52.790
and if for some reason they
were to be put out of the way,

43:52.840 --> 43:55.190
that could be very advantageous to us.

43:55.240 --> 43:58.030
I just wouldn't want to think
that we were doing anything...

43:58.080 --> 43:59.480
Illegal?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.390
Well...

44:03.440 --> 44:05.630
you signed a confidentiality agreement

44:05.680 --> 44:08.390
when you did that business with
Greenfern, and you broke it.

44:08.440 --> 44:11.150
But, er, you don't need
to worry about that.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.200
We'll look after you.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.990
We've upgraded your company car.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.910
It's parked out back.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.100
I think you'll like it.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.390
I don't know why you're
asking me these questions.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.190
Why is this even a police matter?

44:48.240 --> 44:50.350
I'll tell you why, Dr Leese.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.590
Mark Henson, Laura Jones and
Steve Mullen are all dead.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.190
All killed in unusual circumstances.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.590
You used the three of them in some
sort of medical experiment in India.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.030
That's what connects them.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.470
I didn't use them and
it wasn't an experiment.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.110
I wouldn't use that sort of terminology.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.510
What we're talking about
is a fully authorised

45:08.560 --> 45:10.960
and legitimate medical trial.

45:11.640 --> 45:12.750
You knew them.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.270
No. I headed up a company, Greenfern,

45:15.320 --> 45:19.790
which provided research facilities
of the nature you have described.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.310
We had hundreds of
volunteers passing through.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.670
I actually met very few of them.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.950
Does the name Henry Williams
mean anything to you?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.830
No, I can't say that it does.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.270
And when was the last time you
saw Mark Henson, Laura Jones

45:32.320 --> 45:33.830
or Steve Mullen?

45:33.880 --> 45:36.310
I'm not sure I ever saw them.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.300
They're just names.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.470
I went there as David Leese.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.430
I got there before him, they
didn't even ask for the invitation.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.430
They knew I was coming.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.910
They were expecting me.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.390
That's not possible...

45:51.440 --> 45:54.470
They wouldn't try something like
that if they knew you were SFO.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.270
So, what exactly did happen?

45:56.320 --> 45:58.070
There were girls.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.070
There were rooms upstairs.

46:00.120 --> 46:03.150
There were training courses
in the South of France.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.390
If they're coercing the doctors
and pharmacists with bribery,

46:06.440 --> 46:09.990
corruption and the rest of it, then...

46:10.040 --> 46:11.910
we've nailed them.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.980
I didn't see anything. I
wasn't there long enough.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.870
It was like it was all set up.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.460
The drink, the Cristal.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.670
They were waiting for me.

46:25.720 --> 46:29.590
But no-one else knew about
this except for me and you.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.470
And I didn't say anything.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.190
So, how did they know?

46:33.240 --> 46:35.840
Marcus, I could have been killed.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.030
Yes?

46:51.080 --> 46:52.830
Mrs Williams?

46:52.880 --> 46:54.030
Yes.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.710
I wonder if Henry is in?

46:55.760 --> 46:56.900
No.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.230
What's this about?

46:59.280 --> 47:01.620
Can I come in for a moment?

47:13.040 --> 47:14.950
I'm afraid we've had a complaint

47:15.000 --> 47:17.910
from the manager of the car
wash where Henry was employed.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.630
Tom phoned you?

47:19.680 --> 47:22.950
It seems that Henry may have
committed criminal damage.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.750
He smashed a car window.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.500
He lost his temper. He
didn't know what he was doing!

47:28.880 --> 47:31.150
Are you sure he's not here, Mrs Williams?

47:31.200 --> 47:32.710
Could I take a quick look upstairs?

47:32.760 --> 47:34.500
If you want to.

47:35.120 --> 47:38.470
Between you and me, you've
got nothing to worry about.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.190
I'm sure they won't press charges.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.790
Er, hi, Jo?

48:21.840 --> 48:24.870
Er, this is Arrash, Leila's brother.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.950
Yeah, I was supposed to
see the room last night.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.150
I got caught up.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.990
I'm really sorry.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.110
Yeah, I can come round today, if you like?

48:32.160 --> 48:34.160
Any time that suits?

48:35.520 --> 48:37.190
What, already?

48:38.280 --> 48:41.190
Well, er, if they change
their mind, then...

48:41.240 --> 48:44.350
David Leese works for the
City of London Health Trust.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.190
He's the one who hired them.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.110
Mark Henson, Laura Jones, Steve Mullen.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.630
Is he the one killing them?

48:50.680 --> 48:53.350
No. He's not got it in him.
He's just a pen-pusher.

48:53.400 --> 48:58.230
It's this Henry Williams we need to
find, but all we've got is the name.

48:58.280 --> 49:01.910
What about these two women at the
station? The contract workers.

49:01.960 --> 49:03.390
Still trying to find them.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.950
So far, nothing.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.110
You think they could be part of this?

49:08.160 --> 49:10.190
The cameras were switched
off. That's not easy.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.510
We don't know it was them.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.310
I've found Henry Williams.

49:15.360 --> 49:19.190
Sayyad, there must be 400 Henry
Williamses listed in London.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.630
That's 400 addresses.
400 telephone numbers.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.470
How have you managed
that in just one morning?

49:25.520 --> 49:27.190
I Googled him.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.070
There's a company called Squeegees.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.830
They're a car wash.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.800
They have an online newsletter and,
er, they write about their staff.

49:36.800 --> 49:40.000
How do you know it's the
right Henry Williams?

49:41.480 --> 49:43.480
This is his picture.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.030
So?

49:47.080 --> 49:49.910
Well, I went back over the CCTV.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.680
This is the entrance to the station
where Laura Jones was killed.

49:58.520 --> 50:01.280
Hi.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.990
Erm...

50:04.040 --> 50:08.990
I found something interesting on
Elizabeth Leese, David Leese's wife.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.750
She used to work for a company
that was owned by UK Remicon.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.030
That's where she met
her husband. He was CEO.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.550
Greenfern?

50:26.240 --> 50:28.390
Sorry about that, I had to take a call.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.980
But you're right, he's not here.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.950
Don't mention this to Henry, Mrs Williams.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
There's no need to upset
him unnecessarily.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.590
He was only here for three
months and, to be honest,

50:47.640 --> 50:49.630
I was glad to see the back of him.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.710
Did you fire him?

50:51.760 --> 50:53.070
I didn't need to.

50:53.120 --> 50:56.120
In the end, he had a sort of a breakdown.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.150
I haven't seen him since.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.030
Are you saying he was off his nut?

51:00.080 --> 51:01.790
I wouldn't use that language.

51:01.840 --> 51:04.270
But he wasn't all together? Up there.

51:04.320 --> 51:06.990
I would say he certainly needed help.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.230
You have his address?

51:08.280 --> 51:10.080
Yeah, of course.

51:11.840 --> 51:13.670
So, what is it?

51:13.720 --> 51:15.470
Greenfern was based in India.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.510
It was R&D, testing new drugs.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.470
So, this is the smoking gun.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.790
This is what links David
Leese to UK Remicon.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.790
It would do, except Greenfern
was closed down six years ago.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.590
There is one bit of Greenfern
that's still operating.

51:27.640 --> 51:30.270
They call themselves GCS,
but that's just a disguise.

51:30.320 --> 51:33.910
It stands for Greenfern
Consultancy Services.

51:33.960 --> 51:37.590
They're still making payments
every month to one person.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.640
Who's Henry Williams?

51:41.040 --> 51:43.180
I'm sorry. He's not in.

51:44.160 --> 51:46.790
What did you say this was all about?

51:46.840 --> 51:49.640
I'm not sure I did say, Mrs Williams.

51:51.480 --> 51:53.630
We just want to talk to him.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.220
That's all.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.030
I... Is he in some sort of trouble?

51:58.080 --> 51:59.710
Now, why would you think that?

51:59.760 --> 52:00.990
I wouldn't.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.470
Henry's always been a
very quiet sort of boy.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.510
But...

52:04.560 --> 52:07.350
you said you're the police.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.680
And he's, what? 28, 29?

52:10.760 --> 52:12.360
Hardly a boy.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.600
Where is he now?

52:16.280 --> 52:17.880
I don't know.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.750
He went out to get the shopping.

52:20.800 --> 52:22.190
Mrs Williams.

52:22.240 --> 52:25.910
Can you tell me where Henry was
three nights ago around 6:40?

52:25.960 --> 52:27.760
Three nights ago?

52:33.840 --> 52:35.180
Monday?

52:37.160 --> 52:40.160
Monday? Well, he was, he was here with me.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.830
Are you sure about that?

52:42.880 --> 52:45.420
Yes. I'm sure he didn't go out.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.150
Then...

52:47.200 --> 52:49.790
how would you explain this photograph?

52:49.840 --> 52:52.830
It was taken on Monday just
before 6:40, at a tube station

52:52.880 --> 52:55.080
the other side of London.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.310
Is that Henry?

53:02.160 --> 53:03.750
You tell me.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.110
Well, it looks like him.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.700
But it can't be. He was with me.

53:08.840 --> 53:12.140
Does the name Laura Jones
mean anything to you?

53:12.760 --> 53:14.270
No.

53:14.320 --> 53:15.910
Or Mark Henson?

53:15.960 --> 53:17.310
Or Steve Mullen?

53:17.360 --> 53:18.500
No.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.540
What is this about?

53:22.640 --> 53:25.940
I wonder if we can take
a look at Henry's room?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.790
How does he afford all this stuff?

53:51.840 --> 53:53.640
Well, well, well.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.710
I don't understand.

54:00.760 --> 54:03.390
He was in India with Mark Henson,
and all the rest of them.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.670
He's a nutter.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.870
It's not rocket science.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.870
That could be him.

54:11.800 --> 54:14.540
Why would he ring his own doorbell?

54:16.000 --> 54:17.600
I'll go down.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.360
It's all right, Mrs Williams. I'll get it.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.830
Stefan.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.750
Rash.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.080
Henry!

54:58.320 --> 54:59.590
Stop!

55:00.600 --> 55:02.540
Henry! Henry, stop!

55:08.200 --> 55:09.560
Henry!

55:19.080 --> 55:21.910
Bruce Lockwood. We should talk to him.
- You and me?

55:21.960 --> 55:23.350
This has got nothing to do with me!

55:23.400 --> 55:26.070
Three people are dead. You could be next.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.790
Henry Williams has confessed.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.430
You're not stupid, but you've
overreached yourself, son.

55:30.480 --> 55:32.590
Get out. You've brought this on yourself.

55:32.640 --> 55:36.540
Can't you see the both of us
are getting the same thing?

55:50.520 --> 55:51.630
Rash?

55:51.680 --> 55:52.880
Missing you already!
