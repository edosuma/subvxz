00:05.266 --> 00:08.443
♪

00:22.196 --> 00:23.066
This is Pride.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.241
Deputy Director Sanchez here.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.677
We got a situation.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.244
Do I need to move
to a secure phone?

00:27.288 --> 00:29.942
No time. A lieutenant commander
was killed.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.509
I need you to report
to Belle Chasse

00:31.553 --> 00:33.903
for immediate transport
to South America.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.905
Shouldn't the Southeast
Field Office be handling that?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.646
You've been personally
requested.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.213
You're authorized to bring
two agents with you.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.215
No one else.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.868
Well, all right.
Uh, who's...

00:42.912 --> 00:44.218
Who requested me?
Who's the victim?

00:44.261 --> 00:45.610
It's classified.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.090
You'll be read in on arrival.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.223
You've got 90 minutes
until wheels up.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.007
That is all.Uh...

01:03.628 --> 01:04.934
SEBASTIAN:
Hello?

01:04.977 --> 01:06.588
Sebastian, sorry to wake you.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.111
Is everything okay?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.026
Eh, no, e-everyone's fine.
Listen.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.291
Need to call Sonja,
pack your bag and your gear.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.032
We're headed to South America.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.426
South America?Belle Chasse in 90.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.690
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.084
Sebastian,
what the hell?

01:24.127 --> 01:25.172
I know. I know.
I overpacked.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.174
I-I get travel anxiety.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.090
Hello.
Forgot one.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.917
Okay.
Where's Sonja?

01:31.961 --> 01:34.050
Is she okay?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.312
Yeah. She had a
prior engagement.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.009
It's 3:15 in the morning.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.098
What kind
of prior engagement...?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.186
It's for tomorrow morning.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.622
That's all I can say.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.232
What do you mean
that's all you can say?

01:44.539 --> 01:46.410
I wanted Sonja here
for a reason.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.240
SOLDIER:
Ready for you, sir.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.115
Come on.
We got a plane to catch.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.644
Oh, God.

02:25.797 --> 02:29.018
Special Agent Pride,
I'm Colonel Stanley Parker,

02:29.061 --> 02:31.194
commanding officer
here at Camp Apache.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.370
Special Agent Gregorio,
Forensic Agent Lund.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.893
Where is "here," Colonel?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.199
Triple Frontier.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.070
Most dangerous place
in South America.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.812
Didn't know we had a
base in the Frontier.Officially, we don't.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.771
I'll fill you in on the move.
It's not secure

02:42.814 --> 02:44.642
to stay in this area
too long.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.383
Wait, wait. Not secure?

02:46.427 --> 02:48.516
Why? 'Cause...
'cause of, like, snipers?

02:50.257 --> 02:52.215
Come on, Sebastian.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.217
It's snipers.
Okay, that's fine.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.480
Knew I should
have packed camo.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.440
PARKER:
The Triple Frontier
is the tri-border junction

02:59.483 --> 03:01.224
of Paraguay,
Argentina and Brazil.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.747
No law. No government.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.227
Breeding ground
for organized crime,

03:04.271 --> 03:05.663
militias and cartels.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.274
Our mission
is drug interdiction.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.059
A JSOC task force comprised
of Green Berets, Navy SEALs

03:10.102 --> 03:12.061
and various alphabet agencies.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.544
SEBASTIAN:
A lot of military resources

03:16.587 --> 03:18.415
to be thrown
at some drug dealers.

03:18.459 --> 03:22.724
We're not hunting down street
pushers, Special Agent Lund.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.248
Our target's the most wanted man
in the Southern Hemisphere.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.076
You're after Sergio Rivera?

03:27.119 --> 03:28.686
Heavyweight champion
of drug lords.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.427
Unified half a dozen cartels
to become

03:30.471 --> 03:32.560
one of the biggest players
in the trafficking world.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.257
Until his lieutenants
staged a coup.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.476
Tried to kill him.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.042
He went into hiding.

03:37.086 --> 03:40.176
For the past two years
nobody could find him.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.310
Until last night.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.921
You found him?

03:45.964 --> 03:48.228
PARKER: We knew he was
somewhere in the frontier.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.273
Confirmed his location
a few days ago.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.276
Sent in a unit to extract him--
alive, if possible.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.322
Walked right
into an ambush.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.541
Rivera was wounded.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.717
Unit leader was KIA.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.590
I'm sorry, Colonel.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.506
But where does NCIS fit in?

04:05.549 --> 04:08.422
Dead officer is Lieutenant
Commander Daryll Watkins.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.075
Lieutenant Comman...

04:13.818 --> 04:16.212
I know Daryll.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.170
From a lifetime ago.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.869
That why you requested me?

04:20.912 --> 04:22.653
I didn't request you,
Agent Pride,

04:22.697 --> 04:24.786
Commander Watkins did.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.747
I've got Rivera.
We've been compromised.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.227
They were waiting for us.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.968
If something happens to me,

04:33.011 --> 04:35.100
contact Dwayne Pride in NCIS.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.407
Tell him we have a mole.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.540
Come on.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.546
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

04:45.589 --> 04:48.113

05:03.738 --> 05:06.088
I know, I know, I'm late.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.872
Hey, what's going on, Percy?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.918
You skip out on a
secret trip last night,

05:09.961 --> 05:12.312
then you show up at lunchtime
looking like that.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.488
I had a meeting.
Couldn't be helped.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.273
What kind of meeting?The personal kind.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.102
Hey, it's not me you're gonna
have to explain yourself to.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.583
PATTON:
Secure link.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.975
Pride's coming online.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.110
PRIDE: Sonja.Hey, Pride.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.112
Look, about last night...

05:30.155 --> 05:31.853
As long as you're okay,
no need to explain.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.637
Not now, at least.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.378
Assume the others
got you up to speed?

05:35.422 --> 05:38.207
Yes, yes. Um,
Lieutenant Commander Watkins,

05:38.250 --> 05:41.253
killed in action while pursuing
drug kingpin Sergio Rivera,

05:41.297 --> 05:43.212
left a dying message for you.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.258
Watkins believed a mole
compromised the mission.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.651
Why reach out to you, King?

05:47.695 --> 05:50.088
My first overseas post
was in the Philippines.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.873
Murder near the base.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.223
Watkins was involved.

05:54.266 --> 05:58.009
Well, um, do you think Rivera's
responsible for this mole?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.446
Or the cartel.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.752
They wanted Rivera dead,
almost succeeded.

06:01.796 --> 06:04.189
He was wounded,
still being operated on.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.279
How did Watkins figure out there
was a mole in the first place?

06:07.323 --> 06:10.152
Not sure. Sebastian found
encrypted files

06:10.195 --> 06:12.154
on Watkins' laptop,
but he couldn't open them.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.808
He's uploading them
to you now, Patton.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.113
All over it.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.725
Oh, we can do a deep dive
of the cartel,

06:17.768 --> 06:19.727
and see if we can find
a link between them

06:19.770 --> 06:21.555
and anyone at Camp Apache.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.471
Gregorio and Sebastian
are questioning everyone

06:24.514 --> 06:26.386
who went on the mission to see
where it went wrong.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.170
Time is of the essence.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.694
If there is a mole,
the entire base is vulnerable.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.218
Hey, we'll reach out to you
as soon as we find anything.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.177
Good. And Sonja--

06:35.220 --> 06:37.527
when I get back,
we're gonna talk.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.577
PARKER:
Mission should've been
a cake-walk.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.493
Rivera was barely guarded
in his compound.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.017
Sent in a small unit
with drone support.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.279
Then the cartel attacked.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.499
It's like they
knew you were coming.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.110
But if that's true, why didn't
they just take out Rivera

06:55.153 --> 06:56.720
before your team arrived?

06:56.764 --> 06:58.418
He had an insurance policy.

06:58.461 --> 07:01.246
Hard drive with every detail
of the cartel's business.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.901
The cartel would
want to get that back.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.034
Attack commenced after
Watkins took possession

07:06.077 --> 07:07.818
of Rivera and the intel.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.994
Both Watkins and the
intel are still in there.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.867
Personally, I could give a crap
about the hard drive.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.825
But in 20 years
of combat operations,

07:14.869 --> 07:16.523
I've never left
a man behind.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.003
But you can't go back in
until we find the mole.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.440
Gonna need you
to work fast.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.006
I got drones
covering the area,

07:22.050 --> 07:24.182
keeping the cartel
at bay for now.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.968
Who else knows
about this, Colonel?
No one.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.492
Keeping it on the DL
until you get more details.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
Any chance I'll be able
to speak to Rivera?

07:31.538 --> 07:32.669
Depends.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.327
You a praying man?

07:44.899 --> 07:46.248
Colonel Parker tell you
why I'm here?

07:46.291 --> 07:47.336
Absolutely not, ma'am.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.642
Just said to answer
your questions.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.208
No need to call me ma'am.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.993
I'm gonna you to walk me
through the mission.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.125
We escorted the unit
to Rivera's compound.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.431
Set up a perimeter

07:55.475 --> 07:56.998
when the commander went in
to extract the target.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.870
Just two guys, huh?
Not a lot of backup.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.046
Two Navy SEALs, ma'am,
all the backup you need.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.093
Fair enough. But again,
please don't call me ma'am.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.617
We also had the
eye in the sky.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.445
Drones scanning
for heat signatures.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.664
So what went wrong?

08:10.707 --> 08:11.969
Everything.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.362
We lost radio contact.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.929
The drones malfunctioned.

08:14.972 --> 08:15.973
didn't pick up
the crap storm coming,

08:16.017 --> 08:17.279
and then all hell broke loose.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.760
Did you see Commander Watkins
get shot?

08:19.803 --> 08:22.545
No, ma'am-- uh, no.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.155
We were laying down
suppressing fire

08:24.199 --> 08:26.201
trying to give
the team inside cover.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.508
So who was inside?

08:28.551 --> 08:31.511
Luis Benicio.
Scout and translator.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.687
And you, uh, you led the unit
to Rivera's compound.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.732
I went in to cover
the exfil point.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.778
I was not allowed
to make contact with Rivera.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.127
Why not?

08:39.170 --> 08:41.216
I'm Argentine Army.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.087
I eat with the unit,
I march with the unit,

08:43.131 --> 08:44.045
and I fight
with the unit,

08:44.088 --> 08:46.526
but I am not part of the unit.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.136
I didn't have the clearance.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.137
I didn't see what happened.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.660
Well, who did?

08:50.704 --> 08:53.141
Three soldiers went in
to extract Rivera.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.882
Commander Watkins,

08:54.925 --> 08:56.884
Sergeant Halliday,
his Green Beret liaison,

08:56.927 --> 08:58.929
and a third man, Connolly.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.757
Who's Connolly?CONNOLLY:
I'll give you three guesses.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.760
Judging by the attitude,
I'd say you're CIA.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.154
Special Activities Division.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.983
What's covert ops doing on
a JSOC drug interdiction?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.724
You see what base you're on?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.596
The resources the government is
putting into finding one man?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.947
It's got nothing to do
with drugs.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.775
What else was Rivera into?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.690
Cartels are flush with cash.

09:20.734 --> 09:21.996
Nowhere to spend it.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.389
They want influence
on the world stage.

09:24.433 --> 09:27.349
One surefire way to get our
attention is to blow things up.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.003
The cartel's funding terrorists?

09:29.046 --> 09:31.048
Rivera was their point man
for years.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.050
When he went into hiding,

09:33.094 --> 09:35.226
he took his contact list.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.707
A who's who of top players
in the terror game.

09:37.751 --> 09:40.101
Did you see what happened when
the compound was attacked?

09:40.144 --> 09:42.146
I was on the other side
of the building.

09:42.190 --> 09:45.062
But I will say it seemed less
an attack and more like a hit.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.151
Why would you say that?

09:47.195 --> 09:50.154
When the shooting started,
that part of the compound

09:50.198 --> 09:53.070
was lit up like July 4.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.159
Fighters knew exactly
where Rivera was.

09:55.203 --> 09:58.162
Anyone next to him
didn't stand a chance.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.860
Meaning Commander Watkins.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.166
And Sergeant Halliday.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.691
It's a miracle she walked away.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.128
Only took a bullet to the arm.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.783
Really want to know
what happened? Talk to her.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.005
No one person in the unit
was anywhere near

10:15.049 --> 10:16.790
Commander Watkins
when he went down.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.530
Yeah, except for this
Sergeant Halliday.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.141
Yeah, but we haven't seen her.
She took a slug to the arm.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.359
She's been in sickbay.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.622
I was just in sickbay.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.580
The only patient
there was Rivera.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.103
All right, then where
is Sergeant Halliday?

10:27.975 --> 10:30.412
Sydney, what the hell?

10:37.114 --> 10:38.246
Stand down, soldier.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.075
Stand down now!

10:42.206 --> 10:44.208
Who the hell are you?

10:44.252 --> 10:47.037
I'm the guy who's telling you
to pull it together now.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.735
You want to explain yourself,
soldier?

10:48.778 --> 10:49.997
Yeah.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.695
This son of a bitch
murdered Watkins.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.716
PRIDE: You did a number
on those SEALs, Sergeant.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.283
They were mouthy.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.024
Not anymore.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.591
I'm pretty sure
you broke the big guy's jaw.

11:22.594 --> 11:26.990
You say Benicio
killed Commander Watkins.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.818
Any evidence?Evidence is out there

11:28.862 --> 11:30.037
with Daryll's body.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.256
With Daryll.Commander Watkins.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.869
He was a mentor, okay?
Nothing weird.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.958
We need to bring him back.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.482
After you calm down.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.005
And tell me why you think

11:42.049 --> 11:43.703
Benicio did this.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.748
He's Argentine Army.
Seventh Jungle Brigade.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.489
What, can't trust an outsider?

11:47.532 --> 11:48.882
We're all outsiders here.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.797
Don't give a crap
what country he's from.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.843
Seventh Jungle Brigade is
basically owned by the cartels.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.933
That all you got?

11:56.977 --> 12:00.154
We were in the compound
when the attack started.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.938
Sergio Rivera in custody.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.767
Benicio was supposed to
cover the exfil point.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.726
Watkins sent me to get him.
He wasn't there.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.857
Abandoned his post.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.163
Next thing I know,
bullets are flying

12:09.206 --> 12:11.731
from inside the compound.

12:12.775 --> 12:13.907
Why would Benicio

12:13.950 --> 12:16.779
go after Commander Watkins
and Rivera?

12:16.823 --> 12:19.042
Commander Watkins trusted me.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.392
I let him down in that compound.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.786
I will not betray his trust.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.835
You talking about the mole?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.402
How...?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.274
Daryll recorded a message for me

12:33.317 --> 12:35.319
before he died,
and that's why I'm here.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.539
Then you should see what I see.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.715
Benicio is working
for the cartel.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.195
He's feeding them intel.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.544
He drew them to the extraction

12:42.587 --> 12:44.807
to make sure Rivera
didn't get out alive.

12:44.851 --> 12:45.939
You saw him pull the trigger?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.810
No.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.073
I was shot the moment I walked

12:50.117 --> 12:51.509
into the courtyard.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.730
I barely got
out with Rivera.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.515
Gonna need more than that.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.390
Satellite phone.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.001
I found it hidden
in Benicio's quarters.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.481
Strictly prohibited.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.875
It's how he communicated
with the cartel.

13:08.918 --> 13:12.008
Pretty good
investigating instincts

13:12.052 --> 13:13.618
for a soldier.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.359
Someone's got to.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.708
But bad judgment.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.493
You can't prove

13:18.536 --> 13:20.451
you found that phone there.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.847
You need to back off

13:24.891 --> 13:27.676
and let NCIS do our job.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
Watkins trusted me.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.076
You should, too.

13:43.910 --> 13:47.217
GREGORIO:
Benicio, can you explain this?

13:47.261 --> 13:50.264
It's a phone.It's a satellite phone,
actually.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.918
LEO capable
with global coverage

13:51.961 --> 13:53.920
and encryption technology. This?

13:53.963 --> 13:56.009
That's what spies use.And just having it

13:56.052 --> 13:57.967
in your possession could get you
transferred to Guantanamo.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.577
I don't know what to tell you.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.927
Why don't you start with why
it was hidden in your mattress?

14:00.970 --> 14:03.277
Then we'll work our way up
to you killing Watkins.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.974
Why would I kill
Commander Watkins?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.062
Because you're working
with the cartels.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.194
Is that what
Sergeant Halliday said?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.239
Oh, she said a lot of things,
Benicio.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.502
Yeah, like the army unit
you came from is corrupt.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.678
You abandoned your post
during the attack

14:13.722 --> 14:15.680
on the compound.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.118
You shot Commander Watkins
and Rivera in cold blood.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.902
Well, do you want to hear
my side, or have you already

14:19.946 --> 14:21.773
made your decision?By all means, talk.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.079
Halliday is right.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.299
My unit is financed
by drug lords,

14:25.342 --> 14:27.649
which is why I left and offered
my services to your government

14:27.692 --> 14:29.042
at great personal risk.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.695
Then what happened
during the attack?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.349
My position was compromised.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.047
I had to find
another exfil point.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.526
Then I led Halliday, Connolly,

14:35.570 --> 14:37.528
and what was left of Rivera
to safety.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.227
That's a very nice story, but it
still doesn't explain the phone.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.794
Do you know what the cartel does

14:42.838 --> 14:44.448
to people who work
for the other side?

14:44.492 --> 14:46.450
They don't kill you.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.975
They kill everyone you love.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.891
Your family.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.675
BENICIO:
They're in hiding.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.155
I can't see them

14:55.198 --> 14:57.766
or I can't contact them
except for that phone.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.116
All because I swore loyalty
to your cause.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.903
LASALLE: Petty Officers
Carter and Henley

15:03.946 --> 15:05.948
have perfect records.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.124
Both served
under Watkins for years.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.605
Completed a dozen
classified operations.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.433
I mean, they're heroes.
It's hard to believe

15:12.476 --> 15:14.000
that they would work
for the cartels.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.524
Well, Benicio checks out, too.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.830
He got himself demoted
in Argentina

15:18.874 --> 15:20.310
because he wouldn't
take a bribe,

15:20.354 --> 15:22.573
and when he went public,
the cartels tried to shut him up

15:22.617 --> 15:23.879
with a car bomb.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.228
Now, Connolly's trickier.

15:25.272 --> 15:28.014
Our friends in Langley
didn't want to say much.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.451
Yeah, well,
that's CIA being CIA.They did say

15:30.494 --> 15:33.497
he's been running successful
ops in the Frontier for years--

15:33.541 --> 15:36.065
so much so that the cartels
put a bounty on his head.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.719
That leaves Sergeant Halliday.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.808
Oh, well,
she's one of the first women

15:39.851 --> 15:42.071
to graduate Green Beret school.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.943
Top of her class.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.641
And the first to be assigned
a forward operating post.

15:46.684 --> 15:47.990
Hmm.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.035
How'd she score that?

15:49.078 --> 15:50.558
Watkins
personally requested her.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.647
He was an instructor of hers
at Fort Bragg.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.519
Before Green Berets,
she was military intelligence.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.173
Served in West Africa,

15:57.217 --> 15:58.522
Jordan,

15:58.566 --> 16:00.437
South Korea.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.265
You sound a little envious.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.920
Yeah, well, the farthest
I've been from New Orleans

16:04.964 --> 16:06.443
is El Paso.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.097
Well, if adventure's
what you want,

16:08.141 --> 16:09.838
you shouldn't have bailed
on that plane last night.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.666
I didn't bail.

16:11.709 --> 16:12.884
Okay?

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
I had something to deal with.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.281
Look, I know
you've been feeling

16:18.325 --> 16:21.502
a little restless
and unsatisfied,

16:21.545 --> 16:23.156
and you and Pride

16:23.199 --> 16:24.896
have had your issues.Not issues.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.421
I've just questioned
some of the risks he took.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.031
All that's sorted out now.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.859
I mean, Pride's on the
straight and narrow.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.166
I know. And you're right.

16:33.209 --> 16:36.038
I have been feeling restless.

16:37.213 --> 16:40.216
And then an opportunity came up.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.175
What kind of opportunity?

16:42.218 --> 16:44.090
Job interview.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.093
FBI International Operations.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.834
Isler recommended me.

16:49.878 --> 16:53.055
The head of the division
came down from D.C. I...

16:53.099 --> 16:54.970
I couldn't cancel.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.102
Well, why didn't you tell Pride?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.190
I didn't tell anyone.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.366
Other than Gregorio.Yeah. She knows.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.064
And me?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.980
I-I-I didn't know

17:05.024 --> 17:06.460
how you'd react.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.679
Hey, well...

17:08.723 --> 17:11.943
if leaving's what you want,
I'd be happy for you.

17:13.554 --> 17:17.819
Is... leaving what you want?

17:20.604 --> 17:22.476
Hey.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.087
I've been waiting for y'all
to wrap up your special moment,

17:25.131 --> 17:26.567
but I know
you're gonna start declaring

17:26.610 --> 17:27.872
your undenying friendship,

17:27.916 --> 17:29.091
and we don't have
that kind of time.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.614
What's up, P?

17:30.658 --> 17:32.573
Decrypted files
on Watkins' laptop,

17:32.616 --> 17:34.401
and I found something.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.968
Transfer orders
for Sergeant Sydney Halliday.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.841
Effective immediately
by Commander Watkins.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.886
Now, why would he send her home?

17:41.930 --> 17:44.933
And why would he have the orders
encrypted on his computer?

17:44.976 --> 17:47.936
Guess it's something to do
with the other files I found.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.941
Well, that's not good.

17:55.030 --> 17:58.599
PRIDE: Sergeant Halliday
met with Sergio Rivera.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.557
Well, looks like
we found our mole.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.819
Maybe.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.865
"Maybe"?

18:03.908 --> 18:06.998
Um, she's hanging with the most
wanted fugitive in the world.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.827
This is surveillance.
Who took this photo?

18:09.871 --> 18:12.047
I don't know.
But Commander Watkins knew

18:12.091 --> 18:13.875
what it meant, and that's why
he had her transferred.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.659
Yeah, well, not before
he took her on the mission.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.008
Pieces don't add up yet.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.662
All right,
then let's go talk to her.

18:18.706 --> 18:19.968
Let's finish the equation.No, no, no, no.

18:20.011 --> 18:20.969
We need more information.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.449
Pride, I know you think

18:22.492 --> 18:23.841
you made a connection
with this girl,

18:23.885 --> 18:24.842
but she played you.

18:24.886 --> 18:25.843
And what if she did?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.671
Wouldn't it make sense

18:27.715 --> 18:29.195
to know as much as we can
before we go at her again?

18:29.238 --> 18:30.805
Okay, how are we gonna do that?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.937
Guys, Rivera just woke up.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.417
He's weak but lucid.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.248
Rivera's the only one who knows
what happened in that compound.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.076
Well, he has no reason
to be honest with us.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.991
Yeah, well, a lifetime
in prison will help.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.253
We'll get answers.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.430
Gun, gun!

18:48.823 --> 18:50.955
Man down!

18:50.999 --> 18:52.827
Medic!

18:52.870 --> 18:54.872
Medic!

18:55.743 --> 18:57.571
Medic! Get a medic!

18:57.614 --> 18:58.702
SEBASTIAN:
What the hell is happening?

18:58.746 --> 19:00.095
Cease fire! Cease fire!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.663
Could be a cartel attack.
The base is on lockdown.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.839
Get him. Get him.
Take care of him.
We got to get to Rivera now.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.276
See any movement:
Negative on infrared, sir.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.284
Back away, Sergeant, right now!

19:15.328 --> 19:16.807
Immediately!

19:16.851 --> 19:18.200
If I move, he dies!

19:23.510 --> 19:24.467
It's too late.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.687
He's already dead.

19:43.791 --> 19:44.922
PARKER: Sergeant
Halliday's secure

19:44.966 --> 19:47.490
and under guard.Your wounded soldier?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.231
He'll pull through.
No other injuries.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.102
Well, except for Rivera.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.365
He's dead.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.757
All the more reason
to get out to the compound

19:53.801 --> 19:55.324
and bring Watkins and Rivera's
intel back

19:55.368 --> 19:56.760
now that we've got our mole.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.849
Well, I'm still not convinced
that we do.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.330
Pride, we literally found her
standing over Rivera's body

20:01.374 --> 20:02.853
with a bloody knife.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.159
You heard what she said.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.726
Someone else
opened up his wounds,

20:05.769 --> 20:07.728
and she was just trying
to save his life.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.817
Swept the perimeter.
Searched around the building,

20:09.860 --> 20:11.558
found this stashed outside.

20:11.601 --> 20:12.994
HK417.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.343
Sergeant Halliday's.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.563
Sebastian...Yeah, yeah.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.608
She stages the attack
to draw attention

20:18.652 --> 20:20.349
from Rivera, then goes back in

20:20.393 --> 20:22.264
to finish him off.Not sure what more
evidence you need,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.613
Special Agent Pride.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.746
Yeah, no,
it's all tied up in a bow.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.138
I got to be honest.
At this moment,

20:27.182 --> 20:28.314
I'm wondering what the hell
Watkins was thinking

20:28.357 --> 20:29.880
when he asked for you.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.839
He did it because he knew
I'd be thorough.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.972
You can send me back
anytime you want, Colonel.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.585
But until then, I'm gonna
conduct my investigation my way.

20:40.804 --> 20:43.590
You have till 0600
to sort this out.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.983
You damn well better have
an answer for me.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.905
Pride,

20:54.949 --> 20:59.562
you really think there's any
question of Halliday's guilt?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.658
HALLIDAY:
I heard the gunfire.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.705
I knew it was a distraction.
I rushed to Rivera.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.924
Figured someone was making
another attempt on his life.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.535
I got there too late.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.276
So in a final act of altruism,

21:17.319 --> 21:19.887
you stabbed him in the neck
and bled him like a pig.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.671
He was choking on his own blood.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.934
I attempted a tracheotomy.

21:23.978 --> 21:26.720
How do you explain your weapon
strafing the courtyard

21:26.763 --> 21:28.722
moments
before you killed Rivera?

21:28.765 --> 21:30.332
Well, someone stole it,
obviously.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
Well, you can't blame Benicio
for this one.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.554
'Cause he's been detained
since you found that phone

21:34.597 --> 21:35.729
in his quarters.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.905
Then I was wrong about him.Oh, okay.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.124
Or he's working
with someone else.Or, or, or, or, or!

21:40.168 --> 21:41.735
You got an answer
for everything.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.476
Why don't you explain this?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.610
You're the mole,
Sergeant Halliday.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.569
You met with Rivera,
fed him intel.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.310
Watkins found out,
was having you transferred.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.182
So you killed him
and killed Rivera.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.014
Gregorio.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.190
Want to give us the room?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.772
Everyone on the base
believes you're guilty.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.818
I'm the only one standing
between you and prison.

22:21.862 --> 22:24.168
'Cause you believe I'm innocent?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.736
You want to know why Commander
Watkins reached out to me

22:26.780 --> 22:27.998
before he died?

22:28.042 --> 22:30.305
Met in Manila.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.308
Philippine Army officer
was killed.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.789
Son of an influential
politician.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.791
Last time anyone had seen him,

22:37.834 --> 22:40.924
he was arguing outside a bar
with a young SEAL lieutenant.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.362
Watkins?

22:43.405 --> 22:46.016
Everyone knew he was guilty.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.584
There was pressure
to wrap it up.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.282
I was sent in to cross Ts
and dot Is.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.807
And then...

22:53.850 --> 22:56.636
I met Daryll.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.856
And everything in me said
he was innocent.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.902
I went up
against the Navy,

23:01.945 --> 23:03.643
my bosses,
the Philippine government.

23:03.686 --> 23:06.515
And I won.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.866
Saying you'll do the same
for me?

23:09.910 --> 23:12.913
If you tell me the truth.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.095
I've been in country
for 18 months.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.010
Building trust with the locals.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.794
Watching it fall apart on every

23:24.838 --> 23:26.883
failed mission
to find Rivera.

23:26.927 --> 23:30.670
We lost a lot of good men.

23:30.713 --> 23:34.282
There had to be a better
way to bring him in.

23:34.325 --> 23:37.024
I went in alone
to contact Rivera.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.461
At least, I thought I did.

23:39.505 --> 23:43.813
I offered Rivera safe passage
to the U.S. in return for intel.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.468
He'd go to prison,
but he'd live.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.470
You told Watkins

23:48.514 --> 23:50.298
He was pissed.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.908
I broke regulations.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.476
That's why I was
being transferred.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.523
But after we
brought Rivera in.

23:57.566 --> 24:00.047
Because...

24:00.090 --> 24:02.919
Rivera trusted you.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.355
He knew you.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.881
Plus, you were
the only one

24:07.924 --> 24:10.666
Watkins was sure
wasn't the mole.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.887
So you see, Special Agent Pride,

24:13.930 --> 24:15.758
I am screwed.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.326
The only person
who believed in me

24:18.369 --> 24:21.372
is lying dead in the jungle.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.859
GREGORIO: So you're taking
her side on this?

24:29.903 --> 24:31.731
Even though you got the knife.
You got the weapon.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.036
And you got the photo.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.516
And I got her story, too.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.126
She was
single-handedly bringing in

24:36.170 --> 24:37.693
the most wanted man
in South America?

24:37.737 --> 24:39.695
Well, I-I ran
Sergeant Halliday's weapon

24:39.739 --> 24:41.305
for prints and DNA.

24:41.349 --> 24:42.785
It was wiped clean.
It could be a frame-up.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.831
Or maybe Sergeant Halliday's
playing Pride.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.572
Damn it, Gregorio.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.791
You know
how I work a case.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.750
I trust my instincts
about suspects,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.055
and I'm usually right.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.535
Yes, you are.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.406
But it would be nice if you gave
the same consideration

24:55.450 --> 24:56.886
to the people who work for you.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.975
You're upset because I sent you
out of the interview.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.977
No, I'm upset because
Sonja's slipping away

25:01.021 --> 25:04.024
and you're not lifting
a finger to stop her.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.291
You feel this way, too?

25:10.334 --> 25:12.946
I have no idea
what's happening right now.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.775
What?

25:15.818 --> 25:18.125
Okay.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.822
Okay, Sebastian.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.781
I want you to contact Loretta.

25:21.824 --> 25:25.219
I want her to do an autopsy
on Rivera's body.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.221
Might be the only way

25:27.264 --> 25:29.745
to prove Sergeant
Halliday's innocence.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.791
Yeah, but I want to find out...Sebastian.

25:36.883 --> 25:40.843
You think I'm pushing
Sonja off the team?

25:40.887 --> 25:42.845
No.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.674
I just don't think you realize
she's got one foot out the door.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.807
Because she didn't get
on the plane?

25:47.850 --> 25:50.679
Like I said, it's not my story
to tell, Pride.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.769
Sonja's unsettled.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.771
She isn't comfortable
talking to me lately.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.207
And I, honestly, I...

25:57.251 --> 25:59.427
I don't know why.
But it's one of the reasons

25:59.470 --> 26:00.907
why I wanted her on this case.

26:00.950 --> 26:04.127
13-hour plane ride
gives us a chance to talk.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.173
Might be past the time to talk.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.133
SONJA:
So, how exactly

26:10.177 --> 26:11.918
does a virtual autopsy work?

26:11.961 --> 26:14.834
Oh, with good equipment and
a trained technician on-site,

26:14.877 --> 26:17.837
an M.E. can execute as good

26:17.880 --> 26:19.795
an exam as if she were there
in person.
Hmm.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.841
Yeah, well, you got my, uh,

26:21.884 --> 26:24.931
third generation camera phone
and a tech

26:24.974 --> 26:26.715
who gets squeamish at the sight
of internal organs, so...

26:26.759 --> 26:28.761
We go to war with the army
we have, Sebastian.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.372
Now, if you could just hold
the phone steady

26:31.415 --> 26:33.679
and guide it
across Mr. Rivera's body.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.291
Multiple contusions
on the chest and abdomen.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.815
Significant trauma.
There's a jagged knife wound

26:39.859 --> 26:41.425
just above
the clavicle...

26:41.469 --> 26:43.210
Is everything all right?

26:43.253 --> 26:44.864
I mean, there's a lot of blood.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.909
I'm speaking to Sonja.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.520
Hmm

26:49.564 --> 26:52.088
Well, because you asked
to take notes on an autopsy

26:52.132 --> 26:54.569
and you're doing anything but.I'm sorry. I...

26:54.613 --> 26:56.789
I got it all.
I got it.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.791
Uh, Sebastian,
I need you to move the camera

26:58.834 --> 27:00.357
towards Mr. Rivera's

27:00.401 --> 27:01.663
left flank.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.404
Uh, okay.

27:03.447 --> 27:04.710
You want to tell me anything?

27:04.753 --> 27:07.713
SEBASTIAN: Ugh.I, um... figured by now

27:07.756 --> 27:09.715
everybody knows why I didn't
get on that plane.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.804
Actually, I don't. I've--
I kind of been wondering that.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.762
Maybe you could...I just muted him.

27:13.806 --> 27:14.981
It's just us.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.635
And I can assure you
I have no idea

27:16.678 --> 27:17.810
why you chose not to go
on the trip.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.596
I had a job interview.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.948
For something really exciting
that I...

27:25.992 --> 27:27.950
I didn't even know
I was interested in

27:27.994 --> 27:29.560
until it presented itself.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.215
That is exciting.Yeah, but...

27:32.259 --> 27:34.914
I-I should've told Pride instead

27:34.957 --> 27:36.959
of being a no-show.He would've understood.

27:37.003 --> 27:40.310
No, no. Not about the interview.
About the job.

27:40.354 --> 27:41.921
If I get it.
You know,

27:41.964 --> 27:44.575
we've had a lot of conflict
in the last few months.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.969
And I questioned
a bunch of his choices.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.972
Dwayne Pride is a grown-up
and so are you.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.714
If they offered you a job
and you wanted to take it,

27:52.758 --> 27:54.890
the decision
can't be about him.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.936
It's got to be about you.

27:59.765 --> 28:00.853
Uh, Sebastian,

28:00.896 --> 28:02.506
hold that spot right there.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.030
Oh, yeah. Right. Good call.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.422
It's extra disgusting.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.730
Yeah. I need you to grab
a scalpel and a bone saw.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.732
We're gonna take a look
inside now.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.780
Seriously?

28:14.823 --> 28:16.912
Judging by my examination,

28:16.956 --> 28:19.045
Sergeant Halliday's story
holds up.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.829
So she didn't kill Rivera?

28:20.873 --> 28:24.006
No. Mr. Rivera aspirated
on his own blood.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.617
There was massive bleeding,

28:26.661 --> 28:28.402
most likely caused
by the introduction

28:28.445 --> 28:30.491
of an anticoagulant.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.624
Probably injected
just before the trauma started.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.844
Sergeant Halliday
didn't have a syringe.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.672
There was no syringe
in the room.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.674
That means someone else
injected Rivera.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.198
Yeah. Plus, I just checked
Watkins's computer.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.679
The surveillance photo of
Sergeant Halliday and Rivera

28:44.723 --> 28:46.812
was put there after Watkins
was killed. It was planted.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.031
Colonel Parker's gonna say
it still doesn't clear her

28:49.075 --> 28:51.338
of being the mole
or murdering Watkins.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.732
And the sun's almost up.
What are we gonna do?

29:03.829 --> 29:06.179
Colonel.
Colonel, hang on.Time's up.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.790
Prisoners are being
transferred for interrogation.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.096
Colonel,
you got to listen to me.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.532
It's done.
And I'm preparing a unit

29:11.575 --> 29:12.751
to go back in
for Commander Watkins.

29:12.794 --> 29:13.926
Don't try to stop me.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.928
I'm not gonna.
But I'm coming with.

29:15.971 --> 29:19.714
Sergeant Halliday
didn't kill Rivera

29:19.758 --> 29:21.585
and neither did Benicio.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.370
But the only way to
figure it out for sure

29:23.413 --> 29:26.373
is to examine
the original crime scene

29:26.416 --> 29:27.853
and Watkins's body

29:27.896 --> 29:28.810
before it's moved.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.857
You want me to authorize NCIS

29:31.900 --> 29:34.381
to go into a war zone
to collect fibers?

29:34.424 --> 29:37.384
If you want to positively ID
the person who killed Watkins,

29:37.427 --> 29:39.603
yes. And find your mole.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.954
Look, Colonel,

29:41.997 --> 29:44.913
I've done this job long enough
to know when a case is finished.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.741
This one isn't.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.787
Let's both get this done right.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.486
Okay.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.836
You and your team
can accompany the mission.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.752
Thank you, Colonel,
but it-it can't just be my team.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.710
I need everyone
who was in the compound

29:59.754 --> 30:00.755
on the day
that Watkins was killed.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.626
That means,
Sergeant Halliday

30:02.670 --> 30:04.846
and Benicio,
they need to come, too.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.125
You're saying
we can monitor the mission

30:23.169 --> 30:24.735
from 4,000 miles away?

30:24.779 --> 30:27.477
Oh, yeah. Sebastian is
rigged with a body cam.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.480
So we can give real-time support
to the crime scene examination.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.482
Impressive.Yeah, I am impressive.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.397
But that's not why
you're sitting over there,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.182
watching me untangle
these wires.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.923
And not helping, by the way.

30:38.967 --> 30:40.664
Sorry, man.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.928
It's Sonja, right?

30:42.971 --> 30:45.321
Big job interview
got you off your game.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.454
You heard about the interview?

30:47.497 --> 30:50.152
Come on. I overheard
you two talking yesterday.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.720
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.940
What do you think
about the whole thing?

30:54.983 --> 30:57.638
I never fault anyone
for following their bliss, bro.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.248
Yeah. Me neither.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.424
But what if it's not?

31:01.468 --> 31:05.472
All right, Percy
and I are close, you know?

31:05.515 --> 31:08.823
We've had some complications
in our partnership.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.000
So you're worried
she'd leave because of you?

31:12.044 --> 31:13.828
Not worried.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.918
Just, um... wondering.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.181
Listen, baby,
we're family.

31:19.225 --> 31:22.141
Complications happen,
par for the course.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.012
Whatever journey
Sonja's on,

31:24.056 --> 31:26.449
might just take
her on a new road.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.027
Pride, you always take us
to the best places.

31:40.594 --> 31:44.206
PRIDE: Like to keep
things interesting.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.295
You know I'm a woman
of her word,

31:46.339 --> 31:49.255
but since one of us
might not make it home, I...

31:49.298 --> 31:50.299
Wait, what?

31:50.343 --> 31:52.432
Just gallows humor, baby.

31:52.475 --> 31:53.737
Aah.

31:53.781 --> 31:57.350
Sonja had a job interview
with FBI.

31:57.393 --> 31:59.961
Couldn't miss it,
so that's why I'm here.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.226
I know.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.925
Had a message from Isler
on my phone after we arrived.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.448
Didn't want me
to think he was trying

32:08.491 --> 32:10.058
to poach one of my agents.

32:10.102 --> 32:13.757
I still think you could
have said something.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.936
Sonja could have
said something, too.

32:20.851 --> 32:24.116
Okay. Well,
figured at this point,

32:24.159 --> 32:25.944
everyone else knows, so...

32:25.987 --> 32:27.423
Everyone knows what?

32:27.467 --> 32:30.557
PARKER:
30 seconds from the LZ.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.531
Area is secure
best we can tell.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.446
Connolly and I will escort you
into the compound.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.274
We got close air support
from the drones,

32:52.318 --> 32:54.494
constant radio contact
with the base.

32:54.537 --> 32:55.974
Didn't do us much good
last time, sir.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.453
Techs have worked out
the kinks.

32:57.497 --> 32:58.933
Still, this area is hot.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.848
We got to be fast
and quiet. Let's move.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.383
CONNOLLY: Rivera's hard drive's
in Watkins's left arm pocket.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.472
PARKER: N-N-No, don't.SEBASTIAN: Yeah, yeah.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.518
Please don't touch the body.Need to secure the intel.

33:18.561 --> 33:21.303
No. You need to let my team
do their job.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.739
SEBASTIAN:
I'll upload the data

33:22.783 --> 33:26.047
from the hard drive
to the NCIS database.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.528
It'll be secure there.That intel is CIA property.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.312
Right now it's evidence
in a double murder.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.358
Identity of the mole could be on
it. You'll get it soon enough.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.099
Colonel.That's why they're
here, Connolly.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.536
Let them do their job.
You got ten minutes.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.103
What is all that?

33:38.146 --> 33:39.800
Remote fingerprint processor,

33:39.843 --> 33:42.455
digital DNA analyzer,
field ballistics test.

33:42.498 --> 33:45.197
We can examine the entire scene,
send it back to NCIS

33:45.240 --> 33:47.416
for immediate results.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.809
SEBASTIAN: All right, Patton.
You with me?

33:48.852 --> 33:50.376
Hey, we're live.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.813
Hard drive receiving data
from Rivera's intel.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.685
Yep, looking for any evidence
of the mole.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.210
All right, I'm gonna run the
victim's body for biologicals.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.300
There's a bloody fingerprint
here I'm sending your way.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.823
All right. We'll scan
for matches in the database

34:02.866 --> 34:04.390
and cross-check DNA.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.435
The prints belong to Rivera.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.089
He grabbed Watkins
when he was shot.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.004
Watkins tried to shield him
from the gunfire.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.440
You seem to know
a lot about it, Sergeant.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.441
I saw it go down.

34:12.485 --> 34:13.790
But not who pulled the trigger.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.096
How convenient.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.967
All right.
Where'd the gunfire come from?

34:17.011 --> 34:20.667
Entryway on the other side of
the courtyard. Automatic weapon.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.191
I tried to get to Watkins,
but he pushed Rivera toward me.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.367
Ordered me to get him out,
Watkins went down.

34:25.411 --> 34:26.325
I got shot.
We went for the exit.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.457
I dragged them to safety.

34:28.501 --> 34:31.243
Everyone's a hero
in this story.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.463
Where were you, Connolly?Engaging the enemy outside.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.030
CARTER: Colonel, we've got
movement in the tree line.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.512
Command, this is Colonel Parker.
Possible enemy contact.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.644
Need confirmation
from the eye in the sky.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.255
COMMAND:
Colonel, that's a negative

34:43.298 --> 34:45.257
from the eye in the sky.
No contact detected.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.259
That's exactly how it happened
last time, sir.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.956
We are about to be hit hard.

34:48.999 --> 34:51.872
Gonna have to shut this down.
Let's get Watkins out of here.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.700
All right, Patton, sounds like
we got to get going.SONJA: Sebastian.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.268
I think I found something in
these files. Hold on a second.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.096
SEBASTIAN: We don't have
a second, Sonja, sorry.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.489
What'd you find?Cash payments to some kind
of informant.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.709
Goes back at
least five years,

35:02.752 --> 35:04.711
when Rivera was still
running the cartels.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.843
You got a name?Better. I got a photo.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.236
PATTON:
Hey, Sebastian.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.500
:
We got an ID on the mole.What?

35:11.544 --> 35:13.372
Patton. Come again.

35:13.415 --> 35:14.851
What happened?I lost comm.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.726
PARKER: Command, come in,
this is Colonel Parker!

35:19.769 --> 35:21.728
Come in! Over!

35:21.771 --> 35:23.469
Someone's blocking the signal.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.948
Not someone.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.517
Don't move!

35:30.563 --> 35:32.826
Gonna try and
make this quick.

35:49.495 --> 35:51.758
Explosions are getting closer--
gonna be here any moment.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.500
Henley and Carter won't be able
to hold the perimeter for long.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.371
I'd say we got
about two minutes.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.068
Agent Lund,
my hard drive, please.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.462
PRIDE: You planned all this--
you killed Watkins

36:00.506 --> 36:03.204
and Rivera, planted
the surveillance photo

36:03.248 --> 36:04.771
so we'd blame
Sergeant Halliday.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.033
But what's the end game?

36:06.076 --> 36:07.556
Huh?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.602
The intel's already been
transferred to NCIS, right?

36:09.645 --> 36:11.473
Even if you get out of here,
you're finished.

36:11.517 --> 36:13.780
Maybe back home--
but this hard drive buys me

36:13.823 --> 36:15.260
a whole new start
when I give it to the cartel...

36:15.303 --> 36:17.349
Put it
on the ground

36:17.392 --> 36:18.437
and get back
on your knees.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.699
What, are you gonna kill us all?

36:19.742 --> 36:21.570
There's about a hundred guys
out there--

36:21.614 --> 36:22.702
I was planning on
letting them do it.

36:22.745 --> 36:23.746
Never gonna make it, Connolly.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.139
I spent a lifetime learning

36:25.183 --> 36:26.619
how to disappear.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.577
No one will find me.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.492
No, I mean you're never
gonna make it out of here.

36:30.536 --> 36:31.928
It's over for you,

36:31.972 --> 36:33.756
whether you realize it or not.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.237
You do realize those grenades
are from the guys on myside,

36:36.281 --> 36:40.502
right?This whole mission was set up
to draw out the mole.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.113
All right? You think I wasn't
gonna have an insurance policy?

36:43.157 --> 36:44.506
Your only way out
is to surrender.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.595
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:48.684 --> 36:50.120
Put it down, Connolly!

36:55.561 --> 36:56.562
Benicio?I'm okay.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.693
Key.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.347
Can you walk?

36:59.391 --> 37:01.393
Gonna have to-- got to get
to Henley and Carter now!

37:01.436 --> 37:02.872
It worked out
like you said, Pride.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.918
Let's save the celebrating
till we get back home safe.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.702
Sergeant, let's go work.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.227
All right, I think
I can get comms back on.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.011
Patton, you there?Hell yeah, we are.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.708
Hey, it looks like
Connolly's the mole.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.580
Yeah, we know--
he just tried to kill us.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.103
It's all right now, though.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.713
Except for the hundred
other guys outside

37:17.757 --> 37:19.846
that also want to kill us.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.848
We need a way out.
Unit radio's down.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.284
We lost contact with the base.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.503
Don't fear,
Triple P is here.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.418
I have access to
the drone feed.

37:26.461 --> 37:27.767
I'll give you a bird's-eye view.

37:29.682 --> 37:30.900
PRIDE: Yeah, well,
make it fast.

37:30.944 --> 37:31.901
They're zeroing in.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.470
Hey, King,
it looks like

37:35.514 --> 37:37.690
your best extraction point
is south of the compound.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.996
Yeah, but you only got about
a minute before it's cut off.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.868
All right, can you get word
to the SEALs?

37:41.911 --> 37:43.913
Have them meet us there.I'm on it.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.394
Sergeant Halliday, lead the way!Yes, sir!

37:46.438 --> 37:47.700
Come on.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.559
I don't mean to interrupt.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.779
:
Mm. You're not.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.216
I wanted to say
good-bye, but...

38:26.260 --> 38:29.002
I don't have the words.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.787
Maybe you
don't need words.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.964
Commander Watkins is...

38:35.008 --> 38:36.836
being returned home.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.099
The man who killed him
has been brought to justice,

38:39.142 --> 38:40.796
and you played a big part

38:40.840 --> 38:43.799
in all of that,
Sergeant Halliday.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.672
You can call me Sydney now.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.849
I'm being processed out.
Discharged.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.720
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.635
I know how much
the Army means to you.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.768
Do you?

38:55.811 --> 38:58.248
I'm not sure anymore.

38:58.292 --> 39:01.034
I joined to make something
of myself, I guess.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.644
And so you did.Yeah, not according

39:02.688 --> 39:04.429
to chain of command.

39:04.472 --> 39:07.301
Guess I never got comfortable
with that part of it.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.086
Following orders
even when I don't agree.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.698
Yeah, well, I might have some
trouble with that part myself

39:12.741 --> 39:14.090
from time to time.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.530
All I ever wanted was to serve.

39:18.573 --> 39:21.576
Make a difference.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.753
It's all over now.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.626
There are other ways to serve.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.236
The State Department?

39:29.279 --> 39:30.672
Peace Corps?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.021
Law enforcement.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.633
Yeah,
I don't know if you noticed,

39:34.676 --> 39:36.591
I don't play well with others.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.506
You'll figure it out.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.465

40:52.450 --> 40:54.930
They will.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.498
We need some time.Right.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.108
To talk.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.763
Gregorio feels like we have
a lot to say to each other.

41:01.807 --> 41:05.767
Well, yeah, she gave me an
earful, too, the other night.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.161
She's right.

41:10.685 --> 41:12.687
Look, I...

41:12.731 --> 41:15.516
I should have told you
about the interview.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.127
Yeah. You should've.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.479
But I get that
it's complicated.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.698
You've had a...
a lot of mixed feelings

41:23.742 --> 41:26.527
about the team recently.
About me.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.311
I don't know, I'm just...

41:28.355 --> 41:30.879
I'm just trying to sort
out where I belong.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.579
As far as I'm concerned,
you belong here.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.538
Not just as an agent,
but as a friend, too.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.757
But...

41:38.800 --> 41:41.934
I won't stand in the way if...

41:41.977 --> 41:44.502
