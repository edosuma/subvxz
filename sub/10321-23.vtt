11:29.857 --> 11:32.960
Hey! [ Laughs ]
Got you!

11:32.993 --> 11:35.128
[ Earl Narrating ]
We got him off the roof...

11:35.162 --> 11:38.298
by tellin' him we had beer
hidden in the back
of the El Camino,

11:38.331 --> 11:41.835
and if he could find it,
he could have it.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.271
Sign says
60 miles to Camden.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.339
I wonder why
they call it a mile.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.375
Well, because
that's what it is.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.510
What else are you
gonna call it, a "clorp"?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.913
No one would know
what you're talkin' about.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.962
What are you doin'?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.502
- [ Brakes Squealing ]
- [ Car Honks ]

12:18.906 --> 12:20.974
Son of a bitch.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.782
[ Earl Narrating ]
After losing Gwen's dad,

12:28.816 --> 12:31.218
we backtracked to his trailer,
hopin' to find him there.

12:31.251 --> 12:35.022
I miss Uncle Roger.
Except for when he
used to lick my cheeks.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.791
'Cause he was hungry
and you had food on your face.

12:37.825 --> 12:41.061
If you would have used
a napkin once in a while,
he would have let you alone.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.963
[ Dog Barking In Distance ]

12:45.098 --> 12:48.101
I don't think we can get
this guy back to Camden, Randy.

12:48.135 --> 12:52.405
I'm gonna have to bring
Gwen here. Let's start
by gettin' him inside.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.111
[ Earl Narrating ]
Patchin' up Gwen and her father
was provin' to be hard,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.380
but we weren't givin' up.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.383
Back at the trailer park,
Darnell was tryin' to
patch things up too.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.252
Look, baby,
I fixed the wall.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.057
That's for Earl to fix,
not you.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.431
All right, this is
all the booze he's got.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.868
It's gonna take a couple
hours to get Gwen.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.303
Make sure
he doesn't drink anything.
[ Mr. Waters Shouting ]

13:23.336 --> 13:27.440
What's he doin'?
He's awake, so I put him in the
bath and threw in a bar of soap.

13:27.474 --> 13:31.811
What'd he look like naked?
Kinda like E.T. when they
found him by the river.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.218
That poor little monkey.
He just wanted to phone home.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.253
[ Earl Narrating ]
When I got to the courthouse,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.023
I had to wait for a break
in the trial to talk to Gwen.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.425
You Honor,
the defendant solicited sex...

13:45.458 --> 13:48.595
from a uniformed officer
in the middle of the day.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.630
That is a lie.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.565
Show the video.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.407
Hey, I know you're
a uniformed officer
and it's the middle of the day,

14:00.440 --> 14:03.243
but would you like to
have sex with me for money?

14:03.276 --> 14:06.113
Uh, You Honor, I'd like to
resign as this woman's counsel.

14:06.146 --> 14:10.350
[ Earl Narrating ] When I
told Gwen what I was doin',
well, she wasn't very happy.

14:10.383 --> 14:14.187
No way.
I am not going to Hendersonville
to talk to that son of a bitch.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.156
Gwen, it's my daughter
Bianca's birthday--

14:16.189 --> 14:19.026
I do not draw children,
Claretta.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.029
Look, I had a bad relationship
with my dad too,

14:22.062 --> 14:24.898
but patchin' it up
makes you feel really good.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.301
Yeah? But I'm guessing your
father didn't treat you like
crap your entire childhood.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.972
I do not want cake, Claretta.
Look, just forget
about this, okay?

14:32.005 --> 14:35.175
It's not your fault.
You were just the straw
that broke the camel's back.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.345
Uh, but that's the thing.
I'm the straw.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.948
Without the straw, the camel
wouldn't have a broken back.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.384
Yes, but if you remove
the straw from the camel's back,
that doesn't fix it.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.486
The camel is still dead.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.659
Camels can go
40 days without water.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.494
We're done here.

[ Engine Shuts Off ]

15:02.469 --> 15:04.337
She wouldn't come with me.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.609
Where's the booze?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.580
Randy, why is the door locked?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.949
He tricked me.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.251
Please don't
make me say how.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.502
[ Lock Clicks ]

15:35.535 --> 15:38.705
He threw my
favorite food at me, Earl.
What was I supposed to do?

15:38.738 --> 15:41.341
Randy, bologna
isn't your favorite food.
Animal crackers are.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.277
No, they're my favorite food
shaped like an animal.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.613
Do you even listen to me
when we talk at night?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.748
[ Earl Narrating ]
That's when I snapped.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.285
I was gonna get Gwen
and her father together
whether they liked it or not.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.190
Oh, crap. There she is.
Here, get these boards off.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.193
Uh, hey, Gwen.
Oh, for the love of God.

16:33.226 --> 16:37.130
If I shoot you with a BB gun,
will you leave me alone?
It's too late for that.

16:37.164 --> 16:41.268
I know what you said about the
whole camel and straw thing, and
you're a better arguer than me.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.570
I just can't live with
this on my conscience.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.639
So I went ahead
and brought your dad here.
You what?

16:48.241 --> 16:50.477
Hey, I tell you!
Geez!

16:52.579 --> 16:54.647
Get out of the way there,
bologna boy.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.250
Earl,
his pants are down.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.486
He doesn't know that, Randy.
Just pull 'em up.

are gross.

No.
Please? If you talk to him
for a minute, I'm sure--

I can't believe I wasted half
my life being angry at him,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.351

It's nice.
[ Chuckles ]

18:04.151 --> 18:07.154
[ Earl Narrating ] It was then
I remembered why I had
a crush on Gwen 20 years ago.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.322
It was her smile.

She always had
a beautiful smile.

So, you gonna
go talk to him?

No. I already got
everything I needed.

Thanks for bringin'
him down here, Earl.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.237

I'd be lyin' if I said this
was the end I was rootin' for.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.744
I was hopin' Gwen and her dad
would make up on the spot.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.315
But sometimes relationships
don't work out that way.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.586
Sometimes the best you can
hope for is at least one person
walkin' away happy again.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.721
I locked him in
the El Camino.
[ Engine Starts ]

18:45.258 --> 18:48.361
I might have locked him
in there with the keys.

That's all right, Randy.
He won't get far.

He doesn't know you're
supposed to put your foot...

Could we stop
and get some bologna?

I can't make any promises,
but if we see a place.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.650

Once Gwen let go of some of
that anger at her dad,

19:10.683 --> 19:12.852
not only did she
find her smile again,

19:12.885 --> 19:15.488
well, she found the smiles
in other people too.

even when you didn't
do anything wrong,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.952
it's okay to let stuff go
and try to patch things up.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.755
See? I told you
it was your fault, dummy.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.759
[ Earl Narrating ] It's better
this way. Holdin' on to anger
just eats you up inside.

to make sure things come out
the way they should.
