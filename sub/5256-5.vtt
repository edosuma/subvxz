What, are you drunk,
you farmhand?

02:01.122 --> 02:04.323

Fighting against alcohol.

02:25.546 --> 02:30.749
<i>Wayne wheeler, in 1893,</i>
<i>graduated from college.</i>

02:30.751 --> 02:34.019
<i>He goes to see</i>

02:34.021 --> 02:36.755
<i>From the anti-saloon league,</i>
<i>speak.</i>

02:36.757 --> 02:37.723
I'm against alcohol.

02:37.725 --> 02:41.827
I'm against the way alcohol
affects the american family.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.829
Men should not
drink at the saloon,

02:43.831 --> 02:46.665
Waste away
their family's money,

02:46.667 --> 02:49.635
Come home, hit their wives,
hit their children.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.069
That shouldn't happen.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.938
<i>After the speech he said,</i>

02:52.940 --> 02:54.973
I'm going to
join your movement,

02:54.975 --> 02:58.110
And I'll devote my life
to making people not drink.

02:58.112 --> 03:02.147
Now, wayne wheeler,
with the anti-saloon league,

03:02.149 --> 03:03.015
Was a dynamo.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.883
He was just biking everywhere.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.719
He was biking
from town to town,

03:07.721 --> 03:08.921
Going door-to-door,

03:08.923 --> 03:12.558
Getting people
to vote against candidates

03:12.560 --> 03:13.492
Who opposed prohibition.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.328
<i>And wayne wheeler would say,</i>
people shouldn't drink.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.098
I was stabbed by a fith--
a pitchfork when I was a child.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.033
<i>And then they would say,</i>

03:21.035 --> 03:26.505
Oh, people can be stabbed
by pitchforks as children?

03:26.507 --> 03:31.877
<i>And wayne wheeler would say,</i>
yes.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.214
[laughs]

03:35.216 --> 03:36.014
- Why did you laugh?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.116
- Because I was seeing
two of you.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.418
- That's okay.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.419
[laughs]

03:40.421 --> 03:41.153
I--
[laughs]

03:41.155 --> 03:44.289
<i>Wayne wheeler was going</i>
<i>to churches to raise money.</i>

03:44.291 --> 03:47.359
<i>He was going</i>
<i>to arrange demonstrations,</i>

03:47.361 --> 03:48.493
<i>And he was always on his bike.</i>

03:48.495 --> 03:50.862
<i>He was always</i>
<i>pedaling furiously.</i>

03:50.864 --> 03:54.633
<i>Wayne wheeler</i>
<i>invented pressure politics.</i>

03:54.635 --> 03:55.534
<i>Wayne wheeler would say,</i>

03:55.536 --> 04:01.006
This person is not strongly
enough in favor of temperance.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.475
<i>Then that person would go down.</i>

04:03.477 --> 04:05.577
<i>Every time--70 for 70.</i>

04:05.579 --> 04:08.046
So wayne wheeler
comes to washington, dc

04:08.048 --> 04:12.184
And starts fighting for
a constitutional amendment

04:12.186 --> 04:13.118
Against alcohol.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.687
<i>Everyone is afraid</i>
<i>of wayne wheeler.</i>

04:15.689 --> 04:18.957
<i>Wayne wheeler is the most</i>
<i>successful lobbyist</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:21.059
<i>In the United States.</i>

04:22.295 --> 04:24.129
There was another
thing that happened

04:24.131 --> 04:26.064
That I'm forgetting right now

04:26.066 --> 04:27.566
That I'll get back to.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.600
That I'll get back to, derek.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.903
But, in the meantime,
prohibition was passed,

04:31.905 --> 04:34.273
And wayne wheeler won the day.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.275
<i>Wayne wheeler was</i>
<i>such a zealot,</i>

04:36.277 --> 04:37.943
Because once
prohibition happened--

04:37.945 --> 04:40.479
That wasn't enough
for wayne wheeler.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.248
<i>He goes to see</i>
<i>the head of the kkk.</i>

04:43.250 --> 04:47.252
I'm a national figure.
I can't do my own bidding,

04:47.254 --> 04:50.689
But you, ku klux klan, can.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.690
<i>So the ku klux klan did it.</i>

04:51.692 --> 04:54.293
They were wayne wheeler's
private security force.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.328
<i>And they would go into bars</i>

04:56.330 --> 04:58.697
<i>And just tear</i>
<i>the [bleep]ing place apart.</i>

04:58.699 --> 05:01.366
<i>The ku klux klan</i>
<i>was a violent organization.</i>

05:01.368 --> 05:03.502
<i>They were</i>
<i>tarring and feathering</i>

05:03.504 --> 05:05.937
<i>People who were bootleggers.</i>

05:05.939 --> 05:09.141

05:09.143 --> 05:11.877

05:14.415 --> 05:15.947
Wayne wheeler--
[laughs]

05:15.949 --> 05:18.383
- Great name.
- Wayne wheeler.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.619
Wayne wheeler is so crazy

05:20.621 --> 05:23.288
Because there was
still industrial alcohol

05:23.290 --> 05:26.425
That was used
to clean engine parts,

05:26.427 --> 05:27.459
To make nail polish.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.529
<i>Wayne wheeler said,</i>
we need to find a way

05:30.531 --> 05:34.533
To make
that legal alcohol poisonous.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.903
We're going to add
methanol to ethanol,

05:37.905 --> 05:40.105
Call it formula number 30,

05:40.107 --> 05:42.574
And then anyone
who drinks ethanol--

05:42.576 --> 05:46.745
Not to clean engines,
but to get drunk--

05:46.747 --> 05:47.379
Will die.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.948
And that's when
the [bleep] hit the fan.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.185
<i>People who were drinking</i>
<i>ethanol mixed with methanol</i>

05:53.187 --> 05:55.554
<i>Didn't know that</i>
<i>that's what they were doing.</i>

05:55.556 --> 05:58.223
<i>It made thousands</i>
<i>of people sick</i>

05:58.225 --> 05:59.324
<i>And hundreds of people die.</i>

05:59.326 --> 06:01.626
<i>And wayne wheeler was saying,</i>
well, it's your own fault.

06:01.628 --> 06:05.230
You know about prohibition.
You know alcohol's illegal.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.531
You're dead now.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.066
<i>And people started thinking,</i>

06:08.068 --> 06:11.336
Why would my own government
do this to me?

06:11.338 --> 06:13.372
Wayne wheeler,
who had been pretty much

06:13.374 --> 06:17.209
Running the government
as a lobbyist, was discredited.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.011
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he went to michigan.</i>

06:20.013 --> 06:22.981
<i>And then died a few weeks</i>
<i>later.</i>

06:22.983 --> 06:26.918
<i>Just because wayne wheeler</i>
<i>was stabbed in the leg</i>

06:26.920 --> 06:31.289
<i>By a pitchfork by</i>
<i>a drunken farmhand as a child,</i>

06:31.291 --> 06:33.024
<i>He had to spend</i>
<i>the rest of his life</i>

06:33.026 --> 06:37.396
<i>Making sure no one else</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:39.097

06:39.099 --> 06:40.399

[laughs]

06:40.401 --> 06:42.134
Oh, god. I just spilled.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.372
I love that

Hi, I'm david wain.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.616
Today we're going to talk
about dorothy fuldheim,

07:31.618 --> 07:36.855
Who set the record for being
on tv for 37 years straight.

07:36.857 --> 07:40.892
The first woman
to anchor a newscast on tv.

07:40.894 --> 07:45.297
She was a [bleep]ing dynamo.

07:45.299 --> 07:50.702
<i>In 1918 dorothy fuldheim is</i>
<i>traveling around the country,</i>

07:50.704 --> 07:51.703
<i>And she's giving speeches.</i>

<i>She's like,</i>
hey, I'm dorothy fuldheim.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.240
And I'm redheaded.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.575
I'm a jew.
I'm short.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.509
I got a different point of view.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.044
<i>Some of the guys, though,</i>
<i>in the audience,</i>

07:59.046 --> 08:00.479
<i>They're like,</i>
thanks, but no thanks.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.280
<i>You know, so you've heard</i>
<i>the classic thing,</i>

08:02.282 --> 08:03.715
<i>"thanks, but no</i> thanks"?

08:03.717 --> 08:04.382
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

08:04.384 --> 08:07.118
- It's like--it's a way of
saying no thanks.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.621
But they add
this little thanks thing

08:09.623 --> 08:11.089
To make it sound
more palatable.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.591
But it really means no thanks.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.659
You know what?
This is what I think.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.560
This is what's going on.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.762
I don't care what people think
about how I look.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.232
I don't care what people think
about what I say.

08:20.234 --> 08:23.869
And in 1932
she travels to germany.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.605
<i>She's like,</i>
I want to meet adolf hitler.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.306
<i>She goes to...</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:32.511
The...Hitler...Office building,
or whatever.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.712
The--I don't know.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.846
- Hitler hall?

08:34.848 --> 08:38.250

08:38.252 --> 08:39.284
Place where hitler worked.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.654
She sees him
coming out of a building.

08:42.656 --> 08:46.191
<i>She starts yelling</i>
<i>these questions in german.</i>

08:46.193 --> 08:50.729
I can't speak german, but it
would sound sort of like this.

<i>They were like,</i> no, no, no.
What are you talking--

09:57.965 --> 09:59.464
A woman doing a newscast?

09:59.466 --> 10:00.599
That's like, it's like,

10:00.601 --> 10:04.736
Oh, we should have
a dog give the news.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.904
- That would be funny.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.573

I would love that.

10:08.575 --> 10:13.478

In cleveland.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.551
- Right, right.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.719
- But she was like,

10:20.721 --> 10:23.221
I don't care
what you guys think.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.222
I'm gonna do it.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.323
<i>And so he says,</i> okay.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.192
I'll--13 weeks is all

11:23.283 --> 11:24.082
[laughs]

11:24.084 --> 11:25.884
<i>So one day, at kent state,</i>

11:25.886 --> 11:27.686
<i>They were protesting</i>
<i>the vietnam war.</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:29.954
<i>And they just start shooting</i>
<i>into the crowd,</i>

11:29.956 --> 11:31.022
<i>And four students were killed.</i>

11:31.024 --> 11:33.458
<i>Dorothy fuldheim, she said,</i>
this is murder.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.761
You know, why are
we killing our own children?

11:36.763 --> 11:40.098
<i>The viewers all wrote in</i>
<i>to her like,</i> fire her.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.200
Get rid of her,
because why should--

11:42.202 --> 11:43.401
She shouldn't have said that.

11:43.403 --> 11:47.238
<i>And she, even herself,</i>
<i>buckled in and said,</i>

11:47.240 --> 11:48.306
Okay, maybe I should resign.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.508
<i>It was really kind of hardcore</i>
<i>if you think about it.</i>

11:50.510 --> 11:51.910
<i>And the head of the station</i>
<i>was like,</i>

11:51.912 --> 11:55.680
No, dorothy, you're way,
way more important

11:55.682 --> 11:56.514
Than this one incident.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.883
And you're probably
right anyway.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.120
And so, no we don't
accept your resignation.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.021
You're going to stay.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.758
<i>And not only did she stay,</i>
<i>she stayed for 37 years.</i>

12:06.760 --> 12:09.928
<i>She was, like,</i>
<i>the voice of the news.</i>

12:09.930 --> 12:13.832
<i>And of the conscience</i>
<i>of a city.</i>

12:13.834 --> 12:16.401
Barbara walters came out,
when she died, and was like,

12:16.403 --> 12:20.038
I would not be doing
what I'm doing--

12:20.040 --> 12:22.107
None of us would be doing
what we're doing

12:22.109 --> 12:23.908
If it wasn't for
dorothy fuldheim.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.311
Do I--no, shut up.
Shut up.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.413
Dorothy fuldheim
spent more time

12:28.415 --> 12:31.349
On air as a newscaster

12:31.351 --> 12:33.518
Than any other woman or man

12:33.520 --> 12:37.789
In broadcast news
journalist history.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.990
That's insane.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.592
That's something
I'm proud of.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.395
She's the pride of cleveland,
pride of the north coast.

all our life.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.415
- Yeah.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.117

cold in the winter,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.619
What else
are you going to do?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.120
- I just love that sound.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.121
Can you hear a strike?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.257
- I can hear a good strap,
yeah.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.057
<i>- Yeah.</i>

13:13.059 --> 13:13.958

my middle fingers.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.866

13:21.868 --> 13:23.401
Nothing.

call me "squirrel bait."

13:33.747 --> 13:35.747
- Squirrel bait?
- Yeah.

13:35.749 --> 13:36.414
- What is that?

13:36.416 --> 13:39.217
- I guess squirrel bait would be
like a nut, like, crazy.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.385
- You're a nut.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.253
There's nothing wrong
with being a nut.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.390

You're an ugly bear.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.856
You smell like a ugly bear.

<i>Yeah, he becomes the</i>
<i>world heavyweight champion.</i>

14:30.604 --> 14:35.106
Right after he wins
the championship he announced,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.541
My name is muhammad ali.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.311
I'm a black islam--
I'm a black muslim.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.014
I am the people's champion.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.918
<i>The war is going on.</i>

14:46.920 --> 14:49.587
<i>Muhammad ali was drafted.</i>

14:49.589 --> 14:53.491
<i>He was like, you know,</i>
my religion doesn't--

14:53.493 --> 14:56.661
I'm not allowed
to fight in wars.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.897
This doesn't seem right?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.231
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:00.233 --> 15:01.432
[belches]

15:01.434 --> 15:02.533
- You all right?

15:02.535 --> 15:03.434
- Yeah, no, I'm okay.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.169
Should I start over
from the beginning?

15:05.171 --> 15:06.804
<i>- Yeah, can you start again?</i>

15:06.806 --> 15:07.438
- [laughs]

15:07.440 --> 15:11.075
Um, we're going to be talking
about the cleveland summit.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.043
[laughter]

15:12.045 --> 15:18.049
So muhammad ali is drafted
and and he says,

15:18.051 --> 15:20.218
Now I'm a conscientious
objector.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.988
My religion doesn't let me
fight in a war.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.890
And then he also added,

15:25.892 --> 15:29.661
I have no quorum
with viet cong.

15:29.663 --> 15:34.032
Like, no viet cong has ever
called me the n-world--n word.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.535
No viet cong
has ever sicced dogs on me.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.003
The draft board said was--

15:39.005 --> 15:41.205
The draft board says--
[laughs]

15:41.207 --> 15:43.474
Too bad.
Sorry, we don't accept that.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.377

what you are doing?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.741
Basically,
if you don't step forward

16:16.743 --> 16:18.376
You're committing a felony.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.579
You can serve
five years in prison.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.414
Thank you.
I know what I'm doing.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.384

football legend jim brown.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.774
<i>And he's like,</i>

And can you not tell him
I told you this?
