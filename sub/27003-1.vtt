Oh.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.910
Yeah.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.918
Mm. So beautiful.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.447
Oh, yeah.

[keyboard keys clacking]

[clicking]

01:52.460 --> 01:53.983
Hey, guys.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.680
You know what time it is.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.639
It's time to crank up
the tunes,

01:57.682 --> 01:59.293
crack open that bottle of wine

01:59.336 --> 02:01.556
and make some
20-minute meals with Molly.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.471
Oh, and don't forget
to come back this Thursday

02:03.514 --> 02:05.821
for a special episode
where I share my...

02:05.864 --> 02:08.258
Okay, so this is, this is on top
of your regular column?

02:08.301 --> 02:10.651
Yup, apparently,
Molly's 20 Minute Meals

02:10.695 --> 02:12.001
is getting popular.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.437
I knew it would.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.178
-Yeah.
-Are they all new recipes?

02:15.222 --> 02:17.006
Well, it's a mixture
of old and new.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.487
I figure people would feel
cheated if I just rehash the...

02:19.530 --> 02:22.011
-Ooh, tacos.
-Yes.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.317
Go on, Aaron, try 'em.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.841
And?

02:27.843 --> 02:29.845
-Well?
-Mm.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.195
-[Molly chuckles]
-Mm. [chuckles]

02:32.239 --> 02:33.457
-Oh.
-[Molly and Angie laughing]

02:33.501 --> 02:35.067
-Oh, okay.
-Ow.

02:35.111 --> 02:38.506
-[laughing]
-That's--

02:38.549 --> 02:40.551
[Molly] But the habanero's
really good, right?

02:40.595 --> 02:44.120
[exhales] Habanero. I don't have
any taste buds left.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.644
-Oh, honey, you're okay.
-[heavy breathing]

02:46.688 --> 02:48.646
I thought he likes spicy food,
Ramona.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.170
That's not spicy.
That's thermonuclear.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.259
[laughing]

02:52.302 --> 02:55.523
How is this even remotely
brunch food?

02:55.566 --> 02:57.351
The pepper will wake you up
more than coffee will.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.874
He-he just needs some milk.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.571
Can we, can we get
a glass of milk, please?

03:00.615 --> 03:03.008
You two are so cute
it's disgusting.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.402
And that's why
we're getting married.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.274
Ooh, speaking of which, Molly,
I need to know

03:07.317 --> 03:09.014
for sure if you wanna give up
your plus one

03:09.058 --> 03:11.147
'cause I gotta give the caterers
the numbers tomorrow.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.236
Please, I'm your maid of honor.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.500
You know, I'm just gonna be busy
grantin' every wish of yours.

03:16.544 --> 03:19.155
And I love you,
but I'm just sayin',

03:19.199 --> 03:22.419
if you wanna bring someone...

03:22.463 --> 03:26.206
If that someone you're talking
about is Dylan, then, no.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.598
She's talking about Dylan.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.731
I am. I like Dylan.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.081
-I think he's super sweet.
-He is super sweet.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.909
But he's more into motocross

03:33.952 --> 03:36.477
than he is being a boyfriend.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.479
Actually, all those months
on tour paid off.

03:38.522 --> 03:42.134
He just landed a Prestone
sponsorship, which is big.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.223
-What?
-[Angie] Well...

03:43.266 --> 03:44.485
Maybe now that he's successful,

03:44.528 --> 03:46.617
he'll move out of your duplex.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.794
What? I'm serious, Molly.
One of you needs to move.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.709
It's kinda weird
living next door to your ex.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.581
Well, it's not gonna be me,
I mean,

03:53.624 --> 03:56.279
he's the one who's gone
all the time.

03:56.323 --> 04:00.109
Plus, I've moved on. It's just,
the guys I meet online...

04:00.152 --> 04:01.632
What about 'em?

04:01.676 --> 04:04.374
No one matches their profile,
you know?

04:04.418 --> 04:07.159
-They all lie.
-Like my ex.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.291
-Angie.
-[Molly chuckles]

04:08.335 --> 04:09.988
I'm serious.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.686
No more online dating for me.

04:11.729 --> 04:14.689
Uh-uh, you are not allowed
to give up on dating.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.082
I'm-I'm not givin' up.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.737
-I just want new experiences.
-New experiences.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.522
-[Ramona] Experiences.
-Mm-hmm.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.307
I just want to meet someone
the old-fashioned way.

04:24.351 --> 04:27.528
You know, romantic, in person.

04:27.571 --> 04:30.095
There's just one problem
with your plan.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.446
There's no reason for strangers
to even talk anymore.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.883
What do you mean?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.276
Look around.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.844
[Ramona] Hm.

04:41.890 --> 04:42.891
Sad.

04:44.675 --> 04:45.894
Good luck, girl.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.290
[chuckles] Thanks.

Dylan?

05:17.534 --> 05:19.406
[coughing]

05:19.449 --> 05:21.582
-Hey, Molly, how are you?
-Hey, Dylan.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.411
I, uh...

05:28.240 --> 05:30.199
Are you okay?

05:30.242 --> 05:32.767
Uh, yeah. All good.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.116
Yeah. Right as rain.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.248
-I heard the alarm.
-Yeah.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.294
I, I thought
you were out of town.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.167
Um, actually, I just got back
a couple of days ago.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.866
And you're, you're cooking?

05:44.909 --> 05:48.435
Uh, yeah, I'm trying.
You know how that goes.

05:48.478 --> 05:51.655
I didn't know
you, um, used your stove.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.005
[exhales] One step at a time.
Yeah.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.230
You know, the new owners
are just redoing my bathroom.

06:01.273 --> 06:03.363
-Yeah, it's sick.
-Are you serious?

06:03.406 --> 06:05.843
They're still working on
my place, so far they've taken

06:05.887 --> 06:08.150
the handles in my kitchen,
you know, the vintage ones.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.194
-Yeah.
-I used to love those.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.545
-[chuckles] You did?
-Yeah.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.547
They had so much character.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.984
I guess, "Out with the old
and in with the new," right?

06:19.901 --> 06:22.120
Yeah. Something like that.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.822
Well, welcome back.
I'll see you around.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.606
Cool.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.781
Hey.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.620
[door opens]

06:45.187 --> 06:46.318
[door opens]

06:50.497 --> 06:53.456

Okay, let's see.

06:57.068 --> 07:00.898
-Recipes, recipes...
-[keyboard keys clacking]

07:04.902 --> 07:08.645
You know what,
I, I got to clear my head.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.821
Yes. That's what I'm gonna do.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.220
[sighs]
Hi.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.917
Can I get a, can I get a water,
please?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.571
-Sure thing.
-Thanks.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.229
-Here is your card.
-Thank you.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.013
-And here's your water.
-Thank you.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.319
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.062
Okay.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.543
Recipe number nine, here I go.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.677
Ooh, something...

07:40.721 --> 07:44.376
Maybe something
occasion-inspired.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.117
-[clatters]
-Oh, no! No, no, no.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.902
-No, no, no, no, no.
-[laptop crackling]

07:47.945 --> 07:49.164
[sighs]

07:50.905 --> 07:51.862
Ah...

07:54.082 --> 07:55.518
[automated response] At Computer
Clinic Concierge,

07:55.562 --> 07:57.085
we value your business.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.348
Whether it's laptop
or PC repairs,

07:59.391 --> 08:03.265
we do it all. Hard drive
repair with recovery, we...

08:03.308 --> 08:05.267
Ah, welcome
to the Computer Clinic.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.443
-Thanks.
-How may I help you?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.490
Um... I think my computer died.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.840
Let's not issue
a death certificate just yet.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.189
What happened?

08:14.232 --> 08:16.800
Um, I spilled coffee
all over it.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.542
That's probably
our number-one problem.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.153
-So you, so you can fix it?
-Of course.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.112
Just fill out this sticker

08:24.155 --> 08:25.940
and we'll get you
right in the queue.

08:25.983 --> 08:30.858
Um... it's just one little
thing. I kinda have a lot--

08:30.901 --> 08:33.948
I see you're concerned about
your private data and privacy.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.950
-Yeah.
-Don't worry about it.

08:35.993 --> 08:39.780
You're totally covered on the
Computer Clinic Privacy Pledge.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.477
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.044
The guys back there
are just gonna be looking

08:44.087 --> 08:45.742
at your operating system,
that's it.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.483
How soon can I get it back?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.703
-Give us a week.
-A week?

08:49.746 --> 08:53.576
No, that's not gonna work.
I have a deadline in three days.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.317
Well, we do have
the quickest turnaround times

08:55.360 --> 08:57.972
in the business. I doubt you're
gonna find anyone faster.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.716
Okay.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.849
-Do your magic.
-I need the computer.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.069
-Oh. Right, right.
-[chuckling]

09:08.112 --> 09:10.462
-Thanks.
-I'll call you when it's ready.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.514
[indistinct chatter]

09:18.558 --> 09:21.865
[sighs] With only nine more
recipes to go

09:21.909 --> 09:25.216
and about an hour per recipe,
that's...

09:25.260 --> 09:27.436
Oh, God. Start writing.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.963
[sighs] Uh, hi.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.618
Can I get, uh,
two habanero tacos, please?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.926
Thanks.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.015
Those need a warning label,
you know?

09:43.017 --> 09:44.409
Do they?

09:46.934 --> 09:48.892
[waiter] Here, Molly,
we made your favorite for you.

09:48.936 --> 09:52.417
Oh, no, I-I-I can't eat these.
My stomach's in knots.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.902
Hey, I... Have mine.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.515
I-I haven't touched them,
I promise.

10:03.559 --> 10:06.257
Thanks. Four habanero tacos,
I guess.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.782
[chuckles] That's very...
This is very kind of you.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.480
-Try them before you thank me.
-Thanks.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.573
Oh, man!

10:19.531 --> 10:21.577
Wow. I'm impressed.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.796
Most people
would have to tear out

10:22.839 --> 10:24.014
their tongues by now.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.147
Mm, no, I-I can feel it.
[laughs]

10:26.190 --> 10:28.192
I just, uh...

10:28.236 --> 10:29.716
[both] The pepper
tastes so good!

10:29.759 --> 10:31.195
[chuckles]

10:31.239 --> 10:32.980
-Jinx!
-[chuckles]

10:36.984 --> 10:38.507
[exhales sharply]

10:40.422 --> 10:42.554
Y-you're not, you're not wrong,
you know?

10:42.598 --> 10:45.209
Uh, these do need
a warning label.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.995
But not for the spice. I feel
an addiction forming already.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.997
-[man chuckles]
-Yeah. I, um...

10:50.040 --> 10:51.955
Pretty soon I'm gonna be moving
to the kitchen.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.088
I, I practically live here
already.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.786
Save a space for me
by the stove.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.658
I'm helpless
against these tacos.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.095
[Molly chuckles]

11:03.314 --> 11:06.056
-Thank you. Cheers.
-Hm.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.103
To... new experiences.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.845
Cheers.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.416
[Molly] Ah. Where is that..

11:18.460 --> 11:20.723
Where is that damn keycard?

11:23.508 --> 11:24.684
Hm.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.599
[intense music]

11:37.697 --> 11:38.610
Ah.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.919
-[gasps]
-Oh, hey! [chuckles] Hey.

11:42.963 --> 11:46.053
-Dylan, you scared me.
-Didn't mean to scare you.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.969
Um... Yeah, you're lookin',
lookin' for this?

11:49.012 --> 11:51.972
Yeah. Where'd you...

11:52.015 --> 11:53.538
Oh, so I found it on the stairs
this morning

11:53.582 --> 11:56.106
when I came to drop off the box

11:56.150 --> 11:58.065
full of your stuff
from my place, [clears throat]

11:58.108 --> 12:01.024
which, I know,
you've been asking for forever.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.113
And, uh...
But you know, I've been...

12:03.157 --> 12:05.463
-Out of town.
-Out of town. I know.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.638
Yeah.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.210
Anyways, I mean, since I'm here,

12:13.254 --> 12:14.516
uh, do you wanna
hang out tonight

12:14.559 --> 12:16.736
and catch up?

12:18.259 --> 12:22.742
I'm... sorry,
I have a deadline.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.352
Right, yeah, uh...

12:24.395 --> 12:26.441
Molly is the...

12:26.484 --> 12:29.139
Molly's, um, food.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.359
-Yeah, exactly. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

12:31.402 --> 12:33.796
-Cool.
-Well...

12:33.840 --> 12:37.495
Thanks for, uh,
dropping this off.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.976
Goodnight, Dylan.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.679
[beeps]

12:49.943 --> 12:51.161
Goodnight.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.345
[sighs] Molly.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.130
She's about to lose it, Moll.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.351
Sorry, I'm just finishing
one more sentence.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.183
So what do you think?

13:15.533 --> 13:18.885
I'm gonna meet my deadline.
Five p.m. today.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.844
Oh, my God, you are so lucky
I am not a bridezilla.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.760
I'd be stomping down Tokyo
right now.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.458
-Why?
-She was asking about the dress.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.376
It's the rarest of creatures.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.728
A genuinely beautiful
bridesmaid dress.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.688
The writer speaks. Yay!

13:39.731 --> 13:42.125
I'm sorry, I know I've been
a little single-minded lately

13:42.169 --> 13:43.257
with this deadline.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.912
A little? Y-you think? [scoffs]

13:45.955 --> 13:48.088
Seriously, I managed
to schedule this fitting

13:48.131 --> 13:51.134
around
two separate investigations.

13:51.178 --> 13:55.573
-[cell phone rings]
-Hello?

13:55.617 --> 13:58.272
[Phil] Ms. Hoyt, this is Phil
from the Computer Clinic.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.187
We have the best news for you.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.537
Our technicians were able
to repair your computer

14:02.580 --> 14:03.930
in less than a week.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.584
You're kiddin'!
My computer's ready.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.413
Uh, I'll be right there.
Thanks.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.851
-[Molly] Yes!
-Uh, Molly? Hello?

14:11.894 --> 14:14.679
-Oh, my God! Yes!
-Wait. Molly!

14:14.723 --> 14:15.898
[sighs] Oh, God.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.339
-Ms. Hoyt.
-Oh!

14:22.383 --> 14:23.688
Thank you so much.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.821
I'm never letting coffee
near you again.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.605
-You're a life saver.
-Just part of the job.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.999
-Now, be careful out there.
-Thank you.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.479
And have fun
at your friend's wedding.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.916
[dramatic music]

14:33.960 --> 14:36.440
Excuse me?

14:36.484 --> 14:37.833
Oh, no, no, I, I saw it

14:37.877 --> 14:40.140
on your cake pops video.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.620
Oh! Right. No. Thank you.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.232
-That's amazing. Right.
-I'm a 20 Minute Mealconvert.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.364
That's, that's great. Thank you.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.330
[sighs]

14:56.373 --> 14:57.766
Sorry I'm late, Caitlin.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.900
I had to pick up
my laptop, and...

15:00.943 --> 15:03.424
No, no, no. It's fine,
it's fine. You're on Molly time.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.642
What?

15:06.383 --> 15:07.428
Well, you know
you're my favorite,

15:07.471 --> 15:09.125
but you're always late.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.040
It's fine.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.173
Your work is so good,
I couldn't care less.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.305
All right,
I pulled up your article.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.046
Just making
a few last-minute changes.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.570
-Changes?
-It's 99% awesome.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.964
Jackson will mock it up,
get you the proof tomorrow.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.792
Perfect.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.663
Traffic's really spiking
because of the ad.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.013
There's real appetite out there

15:27.056 --> 15:29.319
for these kinds of recipes.
Appetite.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.668
-You see what I did there?
-Here you go.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.323
-Oh!
-I didn't even mean to say it.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.238
Comes from working here,
you have food on the brain

15:35.282 --> 15:36.674
all the time.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.459
All the time.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.157
Jasmine, get me something
with chocolate.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.681
-Or Scotch.
-[Jasmine] You got it.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.118
Mm.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.208
-So we're good.
-Almost.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.950
I'm gonna need
another 20 recipes.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.430
-Twenty? When?
-You have oodles of time.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.780
-Three to four weeks.
-Three to four weeks?

15:55.824 --> 15:58.566
There's a really good reason,
though.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.611
-What's, what's the reason?
-I can't say anything.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.265
Shoot!

16:02.309 --> 16:03.440
Well, now,
now you have to tell me.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.529
No, I don't. All right.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.010
All right, I'll tell you.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.970
Corporate wants to do
a Molly app.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.536
-W-what?
-Mm-hmm.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.798
I shouldn't have said anything.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.322
Oh, my God!
Like, a real phone app?

16:15.365 --> 16:17.889
Available on all platforms.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.891
Apple, Android, you name it.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.550
-That's me.
-That's you.

16:26.594 --> 16:30.250
Molly
of Molly's 20 Minute Meals.

16:30.293 --> 16:33.253
Soon to be available
on phones everywhere.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.472
-That's amazing!
-I know.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.257
Now, go do something fun,
get out of here.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.955
Uh, well, I was gonna start
working on those recipes.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.305
[imitates buzzer] Wrong answer.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.524
What?

16:44.220 --> 16:46.179
Honey...

16:46.222 --> 16:48.355
Look at me.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.139
You don't wanna be me.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.794
Don't burn yourself out
working too hard.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.231
Okay? Trust me.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.538
Doing something fun for yourself

16:57.581 --> 16:59.931
has nothing to do with work.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.325
Got it?

17:02.369 --> 17:04.196
Got it.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.415
Go.

17:17.992 --> 17:20.778
[[breathing heavily]

17:25.521 --> 17:27.481
[exhales sharply]

17:27.523 --> 17:30.092
-Oh!
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.311
-I, I didn't mean to.
-It's no, no...

17:31.354 --> 17:34.488
It's okay.

17:34.531 --> 17:37.839
Hey, weren't you at, um, Vino
the other night?

17:37.882 --> 17:41.364
Yeah. I sure was.
[chuckles] Spicy tacos, right?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.062
Yeah, new experiences.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.716
-That's my motto.
-[chuckles] Mine, too. Yeah.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.371
Well, uh,
let's make it official.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.416
-One water, please.
-I'm Jack.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.895
-Molly.
-Nice to meet you.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.854
Uh, you new to the neighborhood?

17:52.897 --> 17:55.030
New to the city.
I just moved here from Seattle.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.206
Oh, uh, what brought you here?
Thanks.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.730
Uh, I was hoping to see a little
bit of sun before I died.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.341
[chuckles]

18:01.384 --> 18:03.647
-That and mostly a new job.
-Thank you.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.563
-Oh. Both very good reasons.
-Yeah.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.435
-Oh!
-Oh! [chuckles]

18:08.478 --> 18:10.654
-I'm sorry. Uh...
-It's okay.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.700
Uh, "I can afford a blemish
on my character,

18:12.743 --> 18:14.310
but not my clothes."

18:14.354 --> 18:15.616
That's from, uh, that's from

18:15.659 --> 18:17.531
Laurawith Vincent Price.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.010
I love that movie.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.143
Nobody knows that line.
That's crazy.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.667
No, I know, I've-I've probably
seen it, like, a dozen times.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.627
-So you're a noir fan?
-Mm. That I am.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.281
Give me a femme fatale,

18:28.324 --> 18:30.283
perfect lighting,
couple of murders.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.545
-Nothing better.
-[chuckles]

18:31.588 --> 18:32.850
Uh, did you hear
about the screening

18:32.894 --> 18:34.156
of Out Of The Pastthis weekend?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.680
-It's a restored print.
-You're kiddin'.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.508
That's another one
of my favorites.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.597
Yeah, it's, uh, it's at
the, the Lakeshore Theater.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.470
-I think it's called?
-That's a really cool theater.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.036
Uh, well, I'm going.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.387
Uh, at the risk of sounding
too forward,

18:47.430 --> 18:50.346
do you wanna join me there?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.435
-Um...
-I mean, no pressure, you know?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.872
It's just one film noir buff
to another.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.136
Mm...

18:57.179 --> 19:00.748
You know, uh, I-I,
I think I will, yeah.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.880
-Yeah?
-I just met a deadline.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.273
And I've been thinking
of something fun

19:04.317 --> 19:05.666
to do to celebrate.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.408
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.279
-Seven o'clock sound good?
-Sounds perfect.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.107
Perfect. All right.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.724
[Molly chuckles]

19:23.423 --> 19:25.251
[keyboard keys clacking]

19:27.905 --> 19:30.647
Ugh, how is your computer
so much faster than mine?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.127
I only use mine for writing.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.172
You use yours for all that

19:33.215 --> 19:36.479
crazy architectural stuff.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.613
Ramona, I'm not sure about this.
This is...

19:39.656 --> 19:41.571
It's a little more you
than it is me.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.270
Not at all, and it's
my bridesmaid's gift to you,

19:44.313 --> 19:45.401
so you're wearing it.

19:45.445 --> 19:48.230
[dramatic music]

19:51.059 --> 19:53.061
Stop angsting over that scar.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.410
You're beautiful.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.241
What do you think about this?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.461
-I love it. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

20:01.504 --> 20:02.940
It's not like
I'm trying too hard?

20:02.984 --> 20:04.986
It's not trying too hard.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.988
It's casual. I think
it's a perfect date look.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.947
Is this a, is this a date?

20:09.991 --> 20:14.300
He's taking you to the movies.
It's a date.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.825
-I'm going on a date.
-[Ramona] Yes, you are.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.914
[dramatic music]

20:21.655 --> 20:23.831
The ending of that movie
always kills me.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.659
Yeah, twists like that
are what make me love noir.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.878
[chuckles] Me, too.

20:27.922 --> 20:31.447
So, um, what's the job
that brought you to Los Angeles?

20:31.491 --> 20:35.277
-I'm an architect.
-Oh, so is my friend, Ramona.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.887
What are you, uh,
what are you working on?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.193
The Madagascar Hilton.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
B-but tell me more about
your column.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.675
Oh.

20:41.718 --> 20:46.201
Well, um, I don't know,
it's a...

20:46.245 --> 20:48.551
It's a twice-weekly feature
for busy go-getters

20:48.595 --> 20:51.685
who don't have enough time
to cook.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.469
That sounds like me.
I have to read that.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.602
-Well, maybe you should.
-I will.

20:55.645 --> 20:59.040
Well, uh, this is, this is me.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.825
It's pretty high-tech
for such an old building.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.611
Oh, uh, yeah,
the new building owners

21:04.654 --> 21:06.656
are doing a major renovation.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.965
Well...

21:14.534 --> 21:15.665
Goodnight.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.581
Goodnight.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.335
[chuckles]

21:40.995 --> 21:43.824
[dramatic music]

21:49.395 --> 21:51.484
[Molly] Oh, can you close that
door? It keeps popping in open.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.312
[Ramona] Oh. Yeah, no problem.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.274
[Angie] Everything you make
is just so cute.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.450
I know, I should have cancelled
these brunches

22:01.494 --> 22:03.800
'cause I am about to burst
out of my dress.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.672
[Ramona laughs]

22:05.715 --> 22:08.370
Okay, so tell us about the guy.
How was the date?

22:08.414 --> 22:10.546
Oh, my gosh, you guys,
it couldn't have gone better

22:10.590 --> 22:11.765
if I planned it myself.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.070
-Ooh.
-[Molly] Yeah.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.594
He was really charming.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.335
-[chuckles]
-[Ramona] Oh, all right.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.380
There was
no low-end conversation at all.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.861
So no red flags, no weird tics?

22:20.904 --> 22:22.906
-No. Nothing.
-No.

22:22.950 --> 22:27.346
I mean, we both like
the same movies, same music,

22:27.389 --> 22:29.260
same ice cream.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.785
Everyone likes ice cream,
but, okay.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.135
You know, you wanna know what
the best part of the date was?

22:34.178 --> 22:36.964
It was romantic, you know,

22:37.007 --> 22:38.705
total opposite of Dylan.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.446
Well, give us details.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.752
What about his family?
Where'd he grow up?

22:42.796 --> 22:46.060
Does he have any brothers?
Any cute brothers for me?

22:46.103 --> 22:48.454
-Good point.
-[Angie chuckles]

22:48.497 --> 22:51.718
I don't... Actually, I...

22:51.761 --> 22:54.590
I don't know where he grew up
or if he has family.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.549
We kinda talked about me
the whole time.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.203
-That's bizarre.
-[Ramona] Or not.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.422
Because she met
one of the few guys

23:00.466 --> 23:02.555
that doesn't just
talk about himself.

23:02.598 --> 23:05.427
Maybe.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.212
So when are you gonna see, uh,
Mr. Mysterious again?

23:08.256 --> 23:12.173
I don't know. What's the proper
protocol? Do I call, text...

23:12.216 --> 23:14.958

and she just got divorced.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.570
-We're the wrong women to ask.
-[Angie] Yeah.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.573
Come on, you guys.
You gotta help me out.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.879
-Call. Yeah.
-[Molly] Yeah?

23:22.923 --> 23:25.621
He's focused on you, he seems
like one of the good ones.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.885
Just make sure you find out
about him this time.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.279
I promise you I will pepper him
with questions

23:31.322 --> 23:33.324
the next time I see him,
detective.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.588
-Good.
-You have my word.

or anything, it's...

-[chuckles] Okay.

25:59.862 --> 26:03.213

I really hope you like it.

-Hm.

-Well, uh...

-And bring my dessert.
-No.

after such an incredible meal.

Molly's chocolate crunch.

you won a New Media Award.

27:32.085 --> 27:35.175
How do you know about that?

Well, this little thing called
Google. You might have heard.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.396
[chuckles] You googled me?

It was more of a w-work thing.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.686
Mm. So, uh,
so where did you grow up?

28:54.123 --> 28:56.952

the most beautiful eyes.

I like it.

-I know.
-How'd you know?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.766
This is a little embarrassing,
but I watched

31:38.809 --> 31:40.986
some of your videos last night.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.945
You mentioned it on
the Blueberry coffee-cake one.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.991
Wow, I'm glad you watched that.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.428

31:48.471 --> 31:50.473
It's a little hot, though.

you stayed over last night.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.435

-[laughs]

34:40.860 --> 34:43.123
Well, you know you're
my favorite customer, but, no.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.909
-Come on!
-Oh! Hey!

34:45.953 --> 34:47.824
Uh, ladies, have we forgotten
about the shots?

34:47.868 --> 34:49.565
[Molly] No, no.
[Angie] Hit. Got it.

34:49.609 --> 34:50.871
To Ramona.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.003
-To Ramona.
-I love you, ladies.

34:55.353 --> 34:57.704
And to Molly
and her new experience.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.141
[Angie] Hm?

35:00.185 --> 35:02.404
-Hey, stranger.
-Uh, uh, hi. Wha...

35:02.448 --> 35:03.492
What are you doing here?

35:03.536 --> 35:04.537
I just thought I'd stop by

35:04.580 --> 35:06.408
to add to the festivities.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.194
-Ramona, right?
-[Ramona] That's me.

35:09.237 --> 35:12.110
-Here you go. Congratulations.
-Oh.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.242
-I hope that's the good stuff.
-Thank you.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.940
That is very thoughtful.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.986
Ah, it's just a little something
to get the party started.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.814
[chuckles] Remember,
I told you he was doing

35:20.857 --> 35:22.468
the Madagascar Hilton?

35:22.511 --> 35:23.730
Yes, and that means you work

35:23.773 --> 35:25.775
for Watkins and O'Donnell.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.168
Yeah. Right.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.346
Hey, what do you think?

35:31.390 --> 35:33.043
-[laughing]
-Good look?

35:33.087 --> 35:34.654
-[Angie] Cute.
-It looks better on you.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.830
[all laughing]

35:36.873 --> 35:38.397
More shots from your admirer.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.877
[Angie] Oh. Thank you.
[Ramona] Work it, girl.

35:42.618 --> 35:45.578
Oh. No, just wait.

35:45.621 --> 35:48.755
Dude, um, seriously,
thank you for the shots,

35:48.798 --> 35:52.541
but we're, you know, having
a little bit of girl time.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.239
It's a gir...
It's a girls' party.

35:54.282 --> 35:57.938
-[laughing] What is happening?
-[upbeat music]

35:57.981 --> 36:00.636
-Oh, my God! What is going on?
-Whoa-oh.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.812
-[cheering]
-Yeah, you did it.

36:02.856 --> 36:05.554
-You did this.
-[women cheering]

36:05.598 --> 36:08.470
[women cheering]

36:15.912 --> 36:15.956
[indistinct chatter]

36:18.088 --> 36:19.742
[Molly] Oh, my God.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.571
Oh, I hate tequila.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.225
Now I know why.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.922
Why don't you take the day off?

36:25.966 --> 36:28.142
-Stay in bed.
-I'd love to.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.578
I mean, you have
the most comfortable bed

36:29.622 --> 36:32.102
I've ever slept in.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.756
Your whole place is gorgeous.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.106
Then stay. I'll be back tonight.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.805
I can't.
I have a ton of work to do.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.633
Clear my schedule
for all of Ramona's

36:40.676 --> 36:42.678
wedding stuff this week.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.290
Here. Try this.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.683
It's my patented hangover cure.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.381
It tastes better than it looks,
I promise.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.643
What is it?

36:50.686 --> 36:52.775
Tomato juice, an egg, parsley

36:52.819 --> 36:55.038
and a secret ingredient.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.476
-A splash of soy sauce?
-[chuckles]

36:57.519 --> 36:59.260
I used to drink this in college.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.523
Yeah, so did I.

37:01.567 --> 37:04.874
My, uh, my frat brothers
used to make it all the time.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.049
Mm.

37:09.139 --> 37:11.881
So, um... there's something

37:11.925 --> 37:14.057
I, I've been wanting to ask you
for a while.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.408
Oh, yeah? What's that?

37:16.451 --> 37:18.279
Are you...

37:18.323 --> 37:20.238
Are you seeing anybody else?

37:22.936 --> 37:25.068
No. Why would you think that?

37:25.112 --> 37:28.637
Just, you're really hard
to reach sometimes.

37:28.681 --> 37:32.162
Because I'm hard to reach,
I'm sleeping around?

37:32.206 --> 37:34.469
Well, why do you have
your phone off?

37:34.513 --> 37:37.516
I turn it off
if I'm taping a segment

37:37.559 --> 37:40.345
or... when I'm writing.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.085
Yeah, but what if some
needs to get a hold of you

37:42.129 --> 37:43.435
for an emergency or something?

37:43.478 --> 37:45.654
[scoffs] For an emergency?

37:45.698 --> 37:49.310
I, uh, I'm not a heart surgeon.

37:49.354 --> 37:53.619
I write recipes for a food blog.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.839
Are you seeing other people?
Is, is that what this is about?

37:56.883 --> 37:58.841
No. No, that's not it. I just...

37:58.885 --> 38:01.235
I-I see how guys look at you
and I don't wanna...

38:01.279 --> 38:02.323
[scoffs]

38:02.367 --> 38:04.412
What?

38:04.456 --> 38:05.892
Oh, dammit.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.981
I'm really blowin' this,
aren't I?

38:12.855 --> 38:15.075
Okay, can I...

38:15.118 --> 38:16.903
Can I just be honest with you
for a second?

38:16.946 --> 38:19.906
Yes, please.

38:19.949 --> 38:24.345
I was supposed to get married...
in April.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.696
The tenth. Two-hundred guests,
the whole...

38:30.743 --> 38:33.136
Anyway, Kiki, my fiancee,
she...

38:36.314 --> 38:39.012
I found out
two days before my wedding

38:39.055 --> 38:41.057
that she was cheating on me.

38:43.408 --> 38:48.064
Oh, that's, that's awful.
I'm sorry.

38:48.108 --> 38:52.068
No, I'm-I'm sorry. I don't...

38:52.112 --> 38:53.940
I shouldn't assume that you're
gonna do the same thing she did

38:53.983 --> 38:55.245
just because...

38:57.596 --> 38:59.119
I apologize.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.992
It's okay. Hey...

39:03.036 --> 39:04.690
[chuckles]

39:04.733 --> 39:07.345
I'm not seeing anybody else.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.608
All right?

39:09.651 --> 39:11.740
I don't wanna see anybody else.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.484
I just want to be with you.
Okay?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.704
Okay.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.923
Good.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.751
That's, that's all I want, too.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.538
-I'm an idiot.
-[chuckles]

39:26.581 --> 39:28.104
-Little bit.
-You're stuck with me now.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.279
[chuckling]

39:31.281 --> 39:34.067
-[Ramona sighs]
-This, this is not gonna work.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.590
Then leave it out.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.244
[Angie] But they're supposed
to match, right?

39:37.287 --> 39:39.289
Yeah, 'cause that's what's gonna
kill our marriage, Ange.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.814
-A mismatched centerpiece.
-[Angie chuckles]

39:41.857 --> 39:43.685
Well, I know someone
who divorced her husband

39:43.729 --> 39:44.773
over a chicken bone.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.949
Oh, thanks for that.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.778
It's a true story.
She found it under the couch.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.127
That is disgusting.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.868
-[laughing]
-[cell phone chimes]

39:52.912 --> 39:54.783
Oh! No.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.176
What's driving me nuts
is all these people

39:56.219 --> 39:58.396
trying to RSVP
at the last minute.

39:58.439 --> 39:59.701
You're supposed to do that
weeks ago.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.790
I know, exactly,
I gave the bartenders

40:01.834 --> 40:03.575
and the caterers
the numbers already.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.098
-[Ramona sighs]
-[Molly's phone chimes]

40:05.141 --> 40:08.101
[Angie groans] Jack again?

40:08.144 --> 40:10.364
Yeah, he's just checkin' on me.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.366
Oh. Well, he seems nice.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.890
He is. I...

40:14.934 --> 40:17.066
You know, it's kinda crazy
how much we have in common.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.024
[Molly's phone chimes]

40:20.853 --> 40:23.421
He's, uh, he's planning
something extravagant,

40:23.464 --> 40:26.032
which honestly feels
a little, like, overkill

40:26.075 --> 40:27.903
because we've been seeing
a lot of each other.

40:27.947 --> 40:30.340
You cannot complain,
your whole problem with Dylan

40:30.384 --> 40:32.342
was that he wasn't
romantic enough.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.910
I-I'm not complaining,
I just...

40:34.954 --> 40:38.218
[sighs] I'm not used to someone
being so attentive.

40:38.261 --> 40:41.613
Hmm, you call it attentive,
I call it suffocating.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.484
What? He texts her
every five seconds.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.747
Shut up. It's new love.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.619
Or it's creepy.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.229
[cell phone ringing]

40:49.272 --> 40:50.360
Mm.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.016
Hey...

40:55.627 --> 40:57.498
[Molly] Oh. No, I, um...

40:57.542 --> 41:00.240
I'm gonna be so swamped until
after Ramona's wedding.

41:01.894 --> 41:04.418
-Okay. Miss you, too.
-[Angie chuckles]

41:08.030 --> 41:09.031
What?

41:10.380 --> 41:12.034
Just sayin'.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.340
Feel like we're gonna be
wedding prepping

41:13.383 --> 41:14.602
for you any day now.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.517
No. You're not.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.432
We just met a few weeks ago.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.521
It's, it's too early for that.

41:20.565 --> 41:24.177
-Remember that. Everyone.
-[laughs] Yeah.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.396
[Molly chuckles]

41:26.440 --> 41:29.356
[instrumental music]

41:39.540 --> 41:42.674
[Aaron]
With this ring, I thee wed.

41:45.590 --> 41:49.811
[chuckles] With this ring,
I thee wed.

41:49.855 --> 41:54.947
By the power vested in me, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.863
-You may now kiss the bride.
-[Ramona gasps]

41:57.906 --> 41:59.995

42:00.039 --> 42:02.737

42:23.149 --> 42:24.542
[indistinct chattering]

42:26.848 --> 42:29.198
Hi, good to see you.

42:29.242 --> 42:31.505
-Oh, uh! Uh...
-Sorry.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.638
Oh, there you are.

42:33.681 --> 42:36.249
Uh, w-what are you,
what are you doing here?

42:36.292 --> 42:38.686
I brought this for you.
You left it at my house.

42:38.730 --> 42:40.296
I thought you might need it
'cause it's supposed to get

42:40.340 --> 42:41.689
really chilly tonight.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.343
-Jack.
-Thanks.

42:43.386 --> 42:45.563
-Hey, Ramona.
-Wow. You came to the reception.

42:45.606 --> 42:48.957
And just in time
for the sit-down dinner.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.959
Molly, can I talk to you
for a second?

42:51.003 --> 42:52.613
I'll have her back to you
in just a minute.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.876
What the hell?

42:54.920 --> 42:57.531
I already told you we don't have
wiggle room for the numbers.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.012
No, no. I-I didn't invite him,
I swear.

43:00.055 --> 43:01.840
Okay, so he just happened
to know the address

43:01.883 --> 43:04.538
and how to find you.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.019
Molly, I already told you,
we get charged on the overrate.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.629
I know, I know,
I wouldn't do that to you,

43:08.673 --> 43:10.283
on-on this day of all days.

43:10.326 --> 43:13.286
Well, you did.
On today of all days.

43:14.635 --> 43:16.202
You know what? Have fun.

43:16.245 --> 43:18.552
Enjoy my party
with your new boyfriend.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.640
Ramona.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.732
Oh. Did I cause a problem?

43:25.777 --> 43:28.562
No, no, it's-it's fine.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.085
I mean, I-I just came to bring
this to you.

43:30.129 --> 43:32.871
I-I'll leave now.

43:32.914 --> 43:37.353
You, uh, you came all this way
just to bring me a jacket?

43:37.397 --> 43:39.355
Yeah. And thank God I did.

43:39.399 --> 43:41.880
You are just all of goosebumps.

43:43.751 --> 43:44.883
Call me later?

43:46.667 --> 43:48.669
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

43:50.323 --> 43:53.543
Okay. Have fun.

43:53.587 --> 43:55.458
[music continues]

43:56.895 --> 43:59.114
-I'll take this. Thanks.
-Okay.

44:01.421 --> 44:03.031
You look like you need this,
honey.

44:03.075 --> 44:05.512
-Thanks.
-So what's going on?

44:05.555 --> 44:08.384
Ramona seemed super upset,
Aaron had to take her inside.

44:09.864 --> 44:11.866
She thinks I invited Jack.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.216
-Did you?
-No, of course not.

44:14.260 --> 44:16.436
I know how tight
the numbers are.

44:16.479 --> 44:17.916
Yeah, well,
don't worry about her.

44:17.959 --> 44:19.439
Everyone gets upset
on their wedding day.

44:19.482 --> 44:21.659
-Yeah, but--
-I will talk to her.

44:22.529 --> 44:23.791
Thanks.

44:25.619 --> 44:28.578
But that's not all that's
bothering you, is it?

44:28.622 --> 44:30.929
-How did you...
-Cop. Remember?

44:30.972 --> 44:32.887
Right.

44:32.931 --> 44:37.370
Um, I don't know, I just...

44:37.413 --> 44:40.547
Jack coming all the way here
just to bring me this jacket...

44:40.590 --> 44:42.288
Definitely strange.

44:42.331 --> 44:44.682
And how did he find the place?

44:44.725 --> 44:47.423
I got lost, and I had GPS.

44:47.467 --> 44:50.557
-Do you think he--
-What?

44:50.600 --> 44:53.081
-Never mind.
-No, Angie, tell me.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.911
Do you think
he was checking in on you?

44:56.955 --> 44:59.348
Like, to see
if you brought a date?

44:59.392 --> 45:01.829
I don't know.

45:01.873 --> 45:05.311
He's been, he's been kind of
intense lately.

45:05.354 --> 45:06.878
Like possessive.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.924
I think you need to take
a few days to yourself.

45:09.968 --> 45:11.317
And tell him that you're busy
with work,

45:11.360 --> 45:13.101
or sick, or something.

45:13.145 --> 45:14.407
You think that'll help?

45:14.450 --> 45:15.756
I think it'll help give you

45:15.800 --> 45:17.236
a clearer sense
of what you want.

45:19.673 --> 45:21.980
Do you feel relieved
that you're not with him

45:22.023 --> 45:25.461
or do you really look forward
to seeing him again?

45:43.436 --> 45:44.829

45:55.361 --> 45:57.580

46:04.544 --> 46:06.633
-[cell phone rings]
-[gasps] Oh, God!

46:10.985 --> 46:12.595
Hi.

46:12.639 --> 46:13.945
Hey, beautiful.
What're you up to?

46:13.988 --> 46:15.598
Uh...

46:15.642 --> 46:17.383
Nothin', I just...

46:17.426 --> 46:19.777
Wanna go catch
a black and white tonight?

46:19.820 --> 46:21.126
Oh, I, uh...

46:21.169 --> 46:23.432
I just started some laundry.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.305
I have to finish it

46:26.348 --> 46:28.350
before I leave tomorrow.

46:29.525 --> 46:31.832
I have a conference.

46:31.876 --> 46:33.573
Did I tell you about that?

46:33.616 --> 46:35.575
No. What is it?

46:35.618 --> 46:37.316
Uh...

46:37.359 --> 46:39.927
It's a, um, tsk...

46:39.971 --> 46:43.322
It's a food and fitness...
thing.

46:43.365 --> 46:48.022
Um, I'll be in San Diego
for three days, so...

46:48.066 --> 46:49.197
Well, how about
you come over here

46:49.241 --> 46:50.720
when you're done
with laundry?

46:50.764 --> 46:52.331
I wish I could, but I have

46:52.374 --> 46:54.159
too much to do before I leave.

46:54.202 --> 46:56.770
[inhales sharply] Sorry.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.816
Uh, what-what-what're
you up to?

47:00.469 --> 47:02.080
Oh, you know...

47:03.516 --> 47:04.691
nothing.

47:10.175 --> 47:12.830
Your recipes for the app
need to be formatted

47:12.873 --> 47:14.179
in several different ways.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.223
[cell phone chimes]

47:18.748 --> 47:19.924
No problem.

47:19.967 --> 47:21.577
Well, it's trickier
than it sounds.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.536
I'm gonna suggest
you do about a dozen or so.

47:23.579 --> 47:25.755
[cell phone chimes]

47:25.799 --> 47:27.279
You need to get that?

47:27.322 --> 47:29.237
No. No.

47:29.281 --> 47:30.543
-No.
-Okay.

47:30.586 --> 47:31.849
[cell phone chimes]

47:33.720 --> 47:35.591
You're distracted.

47:35.635 --> 47:36.766
Sorry.

47:37.506 --> 47:39.247
It's off.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.032
You were saying
I need to reformat

47:41.075 --> 47:43.251
a dozen or so recipes.

47:43.295 --> 47:45.906
Yeah. All right,
let's get started.

47:45.950 --> 47:47.516
[woman on laptop]
We'll take that

47:47.560 --> 47:49.170
half a cup of coconut oil

47:49.214 --> 47:52.130
and a half a cup of honey
or agave,

47:52.173 --> 47:55.350
if you are doing it
completely vegan.

47:55.394 --> 47:57.875
Take your other mashed banana.

47:57.918 --> 48:00.878
Add them altogether
into the bowl,

48:00.921 --> 48:02.967
and go ahead and whisk them...

48:03.010 --> 48:05.795
[cell phone chiming
continuously]

48:09.277 --> 48:11.889
[groans]

48:11.932 --> 48:13.760
What?

48:13.803 --> 48:15.240
[woman on laptop]
...baking soda, not powdered.

48:15.283 --> 48:16.632
There is a big difference.

48:16.676 --> 48:18.547
Just remember that
going forward.

48:18.591 --> 48:21.855
Baking soda. We've got
a little bit of cardamom.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.380
We've got some almond...

48:25.424 --> 48:26.729
[cell phone chimes]

48:30.646 --> 48:33.084
Wonderful! Now take that
one and three quarters...

48:33.127 --> 48:34.955
[man] Okay. Here we go.

48:34.999 --> 48:39.177
In three, two, one.
Action!

48:39.220 --> 48:41.048
Hi, I am Molly.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.485
Thanks for downloading
20 Minute Meals with Molly.

48:45.226 --> 48:47.272
-Uh--
-Stop. It's okay.

48:47.315 --> 48:49.752
We can edit that all out.

48:49.796 --> 48:51.276
Start again.

48:51.319 --> 48:52.407
Go.

48:53.495 --> 48:55.323
Hi, I am Molly.

48:55.367 --> 48:57.717
Thanks for downloading
20 Minute Meals with Molly.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.154
Now fresh dishes, uh...

49:00.198 --> 49:02.548
Delicious...
I am sorry, Caitlin.

49:02.591 --> 49:04.289
-I don't know--
-Okay. It's okay. No, no, no.

49:04.332 --> 49:06.726
No, no, no.
Everyone, just take a break.

49:06.769 --> 49:08.206
Don't go too far.

49:09.555 --> 49:11.644
[Molly mumbles]

49:11.687 --> 49:13.211
Are you okay?

49:13.254 --> 49:16.083
I've never seen you
this scattered.

49:16.127 --> 49:18.346
I just really don't wanna
blow this opportunity.

49:18.390 --> 49:21.088
I know. Is everything okay
outside of work?

49:21.132 --> 49:22.524
With Jack?

49:22.568 --> 49:24.744
Uh, yeah, I... [sighs]

49:24.787 --> 49:27.181
I'm just takin'
a little bit of time away.

49:27.225 --> 49:29.053
See how I feel.

49:29.096 --> 49:30.968
Well, there's never anything
wrong with that.

49:31.011 --> 49:33.753
So... take a moment.

49:33.796 --> 49:35.102
Clear your head.

49:35.146 --> 49:37.670
Get a glass of water,
or whiskey.

49:37.713 --> 49:39.933
-I'm kidding.
-[chuckles]

49:39.977 --> 49:42.283
Come back in
and knock it out of the park.

49:42.327 --> 49:43.806
'Cause I know you will.

49:45.373 --> 49:46.374
Okay.

49:50.422 --> 49:53.033
[scoffs, sighs]

49:53.077 --> 49:55.122
[footsteps]

49:57.951 --> 50:00.823
[switch clicking]

50:00.867 --> 50:02.086
[sighs]

50:11.965 --> 50:14.837
[dramatic music]

50:17.971 --> 50:19.407
What the hell?

50:21.322 --> 50:22.671
Hello?

50:28.416 --> 50:30.027
Is someone here?

50:31.985 --> 50:34.205
[floorboard creaking]

50:37.425 --> 50:38.774
Hello?

51:06.628 --> 51:09.501
[music continues]

51:20.512 --> 51:22.035
Oh, my God.

51:30.696 --> 51:32.437
Could you come over right now?

51:39.574 --> 51:40.793
[sighs]

51:44.231 --> 51:45.493
Ew.

51:46.581 --> 51:47.539
[grunts]

51:48.844 --> 51:51.760
-Hey, Moll, what...
-Ugh.

51:51.804 --> 51:54.459
-Thank you.
-Whoa!

51:54.502 --> 51:57.897
-Yeah.
-What is all this?

51:57.940 --> 52:01.161
Jack did it. I guess
he was trying to be romantic.

52:01.205 --> 52:03.946
[sighs] I don't...
He has a key to your apartment?

52:03.990 --> 52:06.471
No, that's the thing.
I came home to this.

52:07.472 --> 52:08.951
Wait.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.562
You're telling me
he broke into your place

52:10.605 --> 52:11.954
and put all of these here?

52:13.347 --> 52:15.741
Yeah, yeah, it's weird.

52:15.784 --> 52:18.047
This is crazy.
This is insane, Molly.

52:19.919 --> 52:21.138
You need to break up
with this guy.

52:21.181 --> 52:23.749
No, I, uh... I know.

52:23.792 --> 52:24.619
I know.

52:28.710 --> 52:31.060
[indistinct chatter]

52:37.632 --> 52:38.981
-Molly!
-Hey.

52:40.592 --> 52:42.855
[both chuckling]

52:42.898 --> 52:44.726
Ah, I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever.

52:46.119 --> 52:47.338
Welcome back.

52:49.209 --> 52:50.819
So, uh...

52:50.863 --> 52:52.952
-How was the conference?
-Uh--

52:52.995 --> 52:55.172
Did you, did you like
my surprise?

52:55.215 --> 52:58.044
I-I know how much
you like romance, so...

53:02.004 --> 53:03.789
What?

53:03.832 --> 53:06.574
Jack, I've been thinkin'.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.058
You've been thinking...

53:14.408 --> 53:17.759
Well, you're,
you're a really great guy.

53:17.803 --> 53:19.457
[whispers] Thank you.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.850
But I don't think
we're a good match.

53:23.287 --> 53:24.940
[scoffs]

53:24.984 --> 53:26.290
I...

53:26.333 --> 53:28.727
I-I don't agree. I...

53:28.770 --> 53:30.076
We have so much in common.

53:30.119 --> 53:31.643
We-we love the same music,

53:31.686 --> 53:33.471
we laugh at the same jokes.

53:33.514 --> 53:35.037
-We listen to--
-That's all true.

53:35.081 --> 53:38.084
We... We have
a special connection, Molly.

53:39.346 --> 53:41.827
You know this. Right?

53:41.870 --> 53:44.177
Jack, I, I don't know,

53:44.221 --> 53:46.397
with the candles and the roses--

53:46.440 --> 53:48.268
I thought you liked roses.

53:48.312 --> 53:51.010
I... I do.

53:51.053 --> 53:53.839
-But you, you broke into my--
-And the lingerie?

53:53.882 --> 53:55.188
It...

53:55.232 --> 53:56.450
It was romantic.

53:57.669 --> 53:59.627
-Passionate.
-Yes, it...

53:59.671 --> 54:01.150
Yes, it was.

54:01.716 --> 54:02.978
But...

54:04.328 --> 54:05.851
I am not in a place

54:05.894 --> 54:07.983
for that kind of...

54:10.116 --> 54:11.857
intense relationship.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.773
I don't understand.

54:16.688 --> 54:18.603
I can't be in a relationship.

54:20.344 --> 54:22.128
I have too much
going on in my life.

54:23.695 --> 54:25.305
Like what?

54:25.349 --> 54:27.568
-Your job?
-Yes, my job. [chuckles]

54:27.612 --> 54:30.310
Yes, uh, they've moved forward
with the app,

54:30.354 --> 54:33.139
so I have a ton of recipes
to reformat

54:33.182 --> 54:37.796
and new recipes to,
to start and...

54:37.839 --> 54:40.102
And that's not the point.

54:40.146 --> 54:42.975
The point is...

54:43.018 --> 54:44.585
I don't wanna be
in a relationship

54:44.629 --> 54:47.458
if I can't be there
100 percent...

54:48.285 --> 54:49.547
you know?

54:52.506 --> 54:53.899
I understand.

54:55.117 --> 54:56.902
You do?

54:56.945 --> 54:58.382
Yeah, I do.

55:01.907 --> 55:05.258
I just...
I wanna be fair to you.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.479
I can't say I'm happy
about your decision.

55:08.522 --> 55:11.525
But thank you for being
very straightforward with me.

55:12.918 --> 55:14.311
I do appreciate that.

55:17.662 --> 55:21.143
This necklace,
it's, it's beautiful,

55:21.187 --> 55:23.885
but it wouldn't be right
for me to keep it.

55:23.929 --> 55:26.410
No. No, no, no, no.
This...

55:26.453 --> 55:28.281
This belongs to you,
this is yours.

55:29.587 --> 55:31.937
No strings attached, okay?

55:33.939 --> 55:35.636
Come on. Please?

55:35.680 --> 55:36.942
Please wear it.

55:38.465 --> 55:40.249
Please.

55:40.293 --> 55:43.252
-Okay.
-[Jack] Okay.

55:45.907 --> 55:49.128
You know, I-I got it for you
special at this, uh,

55:49.171 --> 55:52.087
estate sale for
this very famous food writer

55:52.131 --> 55:55.526
that you may have heard of,
named, uh, M.F.K. Fisher.

55:55.569 --> 55:58.267
-That's my idol.
-I know.

55:58.311 --> 55:59.399
I know, that's why I thought

55:59.443 --> 56:01.183
it'll be so perfect for you.

56:01.227 --> 56:03.577
And, uh...

56:03.621 --> 56:06.580
Promise me you'll wear it.
Okay?

56:06.624 --> 56:08.539
And when-when you look at it,

56:08.582 --> 56:13.021
don't let it remind you
of a failed romance. Just...

56:13.065 --> 56:15.633
Let it remind you
of how wonderful you are.

56:18.244 --> 56:19.550
Can you do that for me?

56:21.290 --> 56:23.380
-Yes.
-Good.

56:24.468 --> 56:25.773
Goodbye, Molly.

56:26.818 --> 56:28.254
I won't forget you.

56:43.704 --> 56:46.315
-[keys clacking]
-[machine whirring]

56:54.498 --> 56:55.847
[sighs]

56:57.892 --> 56:59.807
Ugh.

56:59.851 --> 57:01.505
How did that get in there?

57:05.900 --> 57:07.336
Ugh.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.951
[lights crackling]

57:12.994 --> 57:15.519
Not again. [exhales]

57:15.562 --> 57:19.174
Jesus! Dylan,
you've got to stop doing that.

57:19.218 --> 57:20.741
Doing what?

57:20.785 --> 57:22.308
Laundry? [chuckles]

57:22.351 --> 57:23.657
Nothing. No, never mind.

57:23.701 --> 57:25.137
Um, hey, listen,

57:25.180 --> 57:26.921
thanks for coming over
the other night.

57:26.965 --> 57:28.140
Yeah, of course.

57:28.183 --> 57:29.881
I, uh...

57:29.924 --> 57:31.491
I ended up
breaking things off with Jack.

57:33.188 --> 57:34.712
Uh, how'd it go?

57:35.669 --> 57:37.192
Well, uh...

57:37.236 --> 57:38.846
As good as
anything like that could go.

57:38.890 --> 57:41.719
I guess,
I'm, I'm a little on edge.

57:41.762 --> 57:43.068
You know, kind of freaked out.

57:44.504 --> 57:46.288
You know, I could, um...

57:46.332 --> 57:49.596
I can install an alarm system
with sensors.

57:49.640 --> 57:52.469
I just did it for my mom.
It's super easy.

57:52.512 --> 57:54.732
That's really nice of you,
but I don't think,

57:54.775 --> 57:56.777
I don't think that's necessary.

57:56.821 --> 57:59.824
You never let anybody do
anything for you.

57:59.867 --> 58:01.521
I'm offering.

58:01.565 --> 58:03.871
Seriously, it's not a big deal.

58:03.915 --> 58:06.483
-You sure?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

58:06.526 --> 58:08.920
-Tomorrow?
-O-okay.

58:08.963 --> 58:10.835
-[chuckles] Thanks.
-Great.

58:15.579 --> 58:18.495
[drill whirring]

58:22.847 --> 58:25.240
All right,
so that is the last sensor.

58:25.284 --> 58:27.895
I already hardwired
the panel downstairs,

58:27.939 --> 58:30.637
so you're good to go.

58:30.681 --> 58:33.292
Cool. I really
appreciate this, Dylan.

58:33.335 --> 58:35.729
You know,
it's a couple of years old,

58:35.773 --> 58:38.558
but it should do the trick.

58:38.602 --> 58:40.342
No Wi-Fi, no hackers.

58:40.386 --> 58:43.128
Hey, um, thank you
for doing all this.

58:43.171 --> 58:44.738
You're,
you're a really good friend.

58:46.305 --> 58:47.567
Right.

58:50.483 --> 58:52.093
I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

58:53.094 --> 58:54.531
Um...

58:56.010 --> 58:57.882
Don't really know
how to say this.

58:57.925 --> 58:59.536
[chuckles]

58:59.579 --> 59:01.059
What?

59:03.583 --> 59:06.673
I'm sorry that
I like nachos and beer

59:06.717 --> 59:09.589
more than the Aha Shazimi.

59:09.633 --> 59:11.112
Ahi Sashimi.

59:11.156 --> 59:13.245
Yeah, that.

59:13.288 --> 59:15.464
And that I,

59:15.508 --> 59:18.293
that I fall asleep
during black and white movies.

59:19.381 --> 59:20.600
But...

59:22.776 --> 59:24.561
But I miss you

59:24.604 --> 59:26.824
and I don't just wanna be
your friend.

59:26.867 --> 59:28.956
-Dylan.
-Yeah...

59:29.000 --> 59:31.872
[mellow music]

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:02.990
If you do just
wanna be friends, Molly,

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:04.949
I'll try to be okay with that.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.214
Just think about it, okay?

01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:11.738
Please.

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:13.174
That's all I ask.

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:20.747
[sighs]

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.184
[dramatic music]

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:36.720
Yeah, got it right here.

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.635
-Thank you for this.
-[man] No problem.

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.506
Hey. How's it goin'?

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.377
-G-good.
-Can I get a...

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:44.118
-Can I get a water please?
-Sure thing.

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:45.206
Thanks.

01:00:47.818 --> 01:00:49.863
Sorry,
your card's been declined.

01:00:49.907 --> 01:00:52.170
What? Uh... No.

01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:55.564
No, it's only three dollar
a water. Try...

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.654
-Try that card again.
-Sure.

01:00:57.697 --> 01:01:00.395
-[panting]
-Sorry, still not going through.

01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:02.702
Uh...

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.269
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:07.141
That... That's impossible.

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.229
Is something wrong
with your card reader?

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:10.057
I don't think so.

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.190
Ugh! Okay, never mind, um...

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:17.848
Let me check my account.
That's weird.

01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.852
[dramatic music]

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.245
What?

01:01:29.947 --> 01:01:32.123
No, I didn't buy any of this.

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:35.343
$432 at Crate and Barrel.

01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:37.824
$260 at Amazon.

01:01:37.868 --> 01:01:41.219
Ms. Hoyt, I'm sorry,
but in reviewing your accounts,

01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:43.743
these charges fit your
established spending pattern.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.702
Otherwise our algorithms
would have picked them up

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.921
as unusual activity.

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:49.880
There was another charge
at Crate and Barrel

01:01:49.923 --> 01:01:52.360
in May for $402.

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:55.276
$250 at Macy's in July--

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.495
Those are fraudulent charges,
too.

01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:58.236
I didn't buy any of that.

01:01:58.279 --> 01:02:00.412
[scoffs]

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.414
Those were not on my account
a week ago!

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:06.244
You're claiming
that months of charges

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:09.073
just simply appeared overnight?

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:11.118
Yes, I-I know it sounds crazy,

01:02:11.162 --> 01:02:13.773
but I don't know
what else to tell you.

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.297
Okay, well.

01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:18.996
We've frozen
your account temporarily,

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:21.172
so there won't be any more
unauthorized transactions

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:24.697
or overdraft charges
while we review your claims.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.786
But what about
getting my money back?

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.267
We return the money
if we determine that the charges

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.095
were indeed fraudulent.

01:02:31.138 --> 01:02:32.487
Okay, and how do you do that?

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:34.272
Through our own investigation.

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:35.926
Which takes how long?

01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:37.797
Ten to twelve days.

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:40.234
Ten to twelve days?

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:41.932
All my accounts
have been completely drained!

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:44.978
How am I supposed to get by
without money?

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:47.328
I'm sorry, I wish
there were more I could do,

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:50.027
but my hands are tied
at this point.

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:53.421
Great.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.425
[instrumental music playing]

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:04.781
[Molly] What the hell?

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:14.312
[sighs] It's pretty dead today,
huh?

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.748
-Weird.
-Yeah.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.532
-I never seen it like this.
-Right?

01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:20.666
-There you are. Hey.
-[Angie] Hey.

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:23.451
-Hi.
-Um...

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:25.932
How was the, uh,
[clears throat] honeymoon?

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:30.676
Short. Way too short.

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:33.374
Molly,
I said some stupid things--

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:35.420
Don't, don't apologize.

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:36.508
-It was your wedding.
-[Ramona sighs]

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.857
It doesn't matter.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:39.467
I'm, I'm sorry.

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:43.428
You were right about Jack.

01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:44.733
Did you tell her--

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:46.300
About the night
of 10,000 roses?

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.867
Oh, yeah.

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:50.435
Hey, Luther.

01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:51.784
You okay?

01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:55.744
[Luther sighs]

01:03:58.399 --> 01:04:00.619
Are you seriously
asking me that right now?

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.883
[Molly] Yeah.

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.755
Your Yelp review has turned
this place into a ghost town.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.540
I-I don't write Yelp reviews.

01:04:08.583 --> 01:04:10.498
-You don't?
-No.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:11.630
Check it out.

01:04:14.502 --> 01:04:16.722
One star?

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:20.944
"So disappointed in what used to
be my favorite restaurant.

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:23.076
Brought a group
of girlfriends here,

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.905
we all left with food poisoning.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.865
Must be a sanitation issue."

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.605
I didn't write this!

01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:33.565
Uh, someone's been hacking
my accounts!

01:04:33.608 --> 01:04:36.481
You didn't write it?
It's-it's a Molly review.

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:38.178
You're the only Molly I know.

01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:40.746
I love this place! [sighs]

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:42.922
[Angie] O-okay, if it was just
your credit cards

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.881
or your bank accounts,
I'd say identity theft.

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.143
That happens all the time,

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.928
but adding this into the mix?

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:51.626
Someone's coming after you
personally.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.238
And you know
who the prime suspect always is.

01:04:57.676 --> 01:04:59.939
[instrumental music
on headphones]

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:08.992
[dramatic music]

01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:10.950
[sighs] Dylan.

01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:13.300
We need to talk.

01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.134
I, uh, got your 9-1-1 texts.

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.354
What's going on?

01:05:25.443 --> 01:05:27.706
You didn't have to do this,
Molly.

01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:29.882
Traffic was already up
on the side.

01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:34.408
Uh, do what?

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:37.063
The photos. You didn't have to
swap out the photos.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.980
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:05:51.991 --> 01:05:53.732
Oh, my God.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:57.301
How did that...

01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:58.955
[Molly whispering] Oh, my God.

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:01.783
You have great recipes.

01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:04.003
You have a wonderful
on-screen presence.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.787
You don't have to try
and drive traffic to your side

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.137
with sexy photos.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.790
Caitlin, I-I...

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.662
-I didn't do that.
-Maybe it's my fault.

01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.838
Maybe I shouldn't have told you
how well this site was doing.

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:15.667
No, I was excited about this.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.016
You're cutting corners. [sighs]

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.932
You're behaving oddly.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.978
I think you need to take
a leave of absence.

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:24.850
I, uh... I don't...
I don't wanna take a--

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:26.765
Legal contacted me

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:29.159
after they received
your last series of recipes.

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:31.378
They found evidence
of plagiarism.

01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:33.250
What? No.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:35.339
Three recipes
from The Joy of Cooking,

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:37.167
one from Mario Batali,

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:40.431
and one deboned duck recipe
from Julia Child.

01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:43.608
Julia Child?
I have made that recipe.

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:45.914
But I, I would never submit it.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.612
You know that.

01:06:47.655 --> 01:06:50.963
I don't plagiarize. Uh...

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.618
That recipe
takes three days to make.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:55.620
Someone's been hacking
all my accounts.

01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:57.578
This is...
This has got to be related.

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:01.713
Take the leave of absence,
Molly.

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.410
Don't make me fire you.

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.849
[dramatic music]

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.333
[sighs]

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:30.394
You don't believe me,
do you?

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:34.746
Right now...

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.443
I don't know
what to believe.

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:51.893
[sobbing]

01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:14.264
It makes sense
to start with Jack.

01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:15.221
I knew something was off
with him

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.571
from the very beginning.

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:19.006
Didn't you say you found him
creeping around your house

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:20.357
in the middle of the night?

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.314
Yeah.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:24.883
I, I just don't see him

01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:27.277
having the skills
to do all of this.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.843
Well, you don't know that.
You don't know him. Period.

01:08:28.886 --> 01:08:30.627
He never talked about himself.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:33.326
From the looks of this house,
he has money.

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:34.675
And if you have money,
you can hire people

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:37.200
with the skills
to do whatever you need.

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:40.680
I can't believe I gave him
the benefit of the doubt.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:42.335
You know, I thought he was
handling the break-up well--

01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:45.207
Hey, hey, you gave him
the benefit of the doubt

01:08:45.251 --> 01:08:47.035
because you're a good person.

01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:50.343
Yeah, well,
look where that got me.

01:08:52.389 --> 01:08:53.520
Hmm?

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:55.000
[sighs]

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:56.654
Let's go.

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:58.002
Yeah.

01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:01.832
[doorbell rings]

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.054
May I help you?

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:09.841
Uh, yeah. Is-is Jack here?

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.886
-That's me.
-No, I'm sorry.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.671
I'm looking for Jack Newsom?

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:16.500
Yes, I'm Jack Newsom.

01:09:16.542 --> 01:09:19.198
Uh, that can't be.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.720
-I--
-I got this. Uh...

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:22.201
Detective Flynn, LAPD.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:24.247
-Can I see your ID, please?
-Oh, yeah.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.901
Great, sure, I didn't think the
police would bother to show up.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.511
Well, it's my fault, really.

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:30.122
I called them and said
there was a break-in,

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.732
but nothing much was taken.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.212
So, I'm sure I didn't end up

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.953
high on the priority list.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.086
Ladies, where are my manners?
I am sorry.

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.218
Please, come in.

01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:43.395
Oh, my God.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:52.796
Please, uh,
make yourself comfortable.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.320
Can I get you something
to drink?

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:56.192
Oh, yeah, we'll actually take,
uh, some water.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:58.585
Thank you.

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.413
So when did this break-in
happen?

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.502
Well, I wouldn't call it
a break-in.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.852
Technically, the windows
and doors were locked.

01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:06.593
So nothing was stolen?

01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:09.814
Huh, just my most expensive
bottle of champagne.

01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:14.688
Other than that... [sighs]

01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:17.474
things just seemed out of place.

01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:19.867
You know, uh, my wine glasses.

01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:21.565
The books. Remote controls.

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:22.957
Oh, my God.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.178
-What's wrong?
-You're an architect.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.571
-Aren't you?
-Yeah.

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.703
Working on
the Madagascar Hilton?

01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:31.792
Yeah, I just got back
from Madagascar four days ago.

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:35.143
-How do you know this? What?
-I was in this house.

01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:36.971
[Molly] Yeah, three weeks ago
with my boyfriend,

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:40.148
who claimed to be an architect
whose name was Jack Newsom.

01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:45.850
I'm really blowing this,
aren't I?

01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:51.377
I was supposed to get married
in April, the 10th.

01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:52.857
Two hundred guests.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.685
Kiki, my fiancée,

01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:56.556
I found out two days
before the wedding

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.732
that she was cheating on me.

01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:01.822
Everything he told me was a lie.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:08.002
Wait a minute.

01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:12.442
The Computer Clinic, when did
you take your computer here?

01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:14.748
Uh, month and a half ago.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:16.533
So whoever did this
must work at the clinic

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:19.492
and have access to everything
on both of your computers.

01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:22.887
Ramona,
if I give you my keycard,

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.715
can you please go to my place
and get my laptop?

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.978
Yeah, of course,
I can even take it

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:27.979
to my IT department,
they can--

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:30.111
Uh, just take it to the station.

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:32.070
Ask for Detective Collins,
he'll know exactly what to do.

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.638
-Got it.
-Angie.

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.943
I think it's time
we pay a visit

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:38.294
to the Computer Clinic,
don't you?

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:44.387
Miss Hoyt, nice to see you.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.302
Tell me
you didn't spill coffee again.

01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:49.000
No, um, can you tell me
who this is?

01:11:49.043 --> 01:11:50.349
Hmm, what is this about?

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:51.350
He's a person of interest

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:52.699
in an investigation.

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.962
-Does he work here?
-Uh, yeah.

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:58.749
That's Stuart Reinbeck.
He's, like, my best employee.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.185
I thought you were dating him.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:03.275
W-well, we were, um...

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.452
Can-can you just tell us
where his... Where he is?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.454
He went to lunch
and ran some errands.

01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:10.151
Can you show us
his workstation, please?

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:11.849
Well, I don't know
if I can do that.

01:12:11.892 --> 01:12:13.241
If you need a warrant,
I'll get one.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.769
No need. Just follow me.

01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:25.384
Like I said,
all the tech employees

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:26.820
are at lunch right now,

01:12:26.864 --> 01:12:29.388
but Stuart's workstation's
right here.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.259
Thanks.

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.918
[Molly] Oh, my God.

01:12:37.962 --> 01:12:40.878
[dramatic music]

01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:44.577
This is insane.

01:12:46.623 --> 01:12:48.407
-[Molly gasps] Oh, my God.
-I don't think that's...

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.191
Don't do that.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.282
Oh...

01:12:56.894 --> 01:13:00.463
He copied my hard drive.

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:02.552
Techs are not supposed to--

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:05.424
He learned everything he could.

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.426
-[mouse button clicks]
-What I watched.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:10.168
What I listened to,
what I... read.

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:14.259
And he made himself
into the perfect guy.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.959
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:21.832
[dramatic music]

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.313
[Molly] I'll be right back.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.844
[sobbing]

01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:41.808
-Jack!
-[shushing]

01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:44.028
You gotta be quiet.
You gotta be quiet, my darling.

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.333
Here you go.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.945
[exhales]

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.468
You got rid of the rose petals.

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:51.470
You got rid of the lingerie.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:54.560
But you didn't get rid of that.

01:13:54.604 --> 01:13:57.476
-It's a tracker.
-Yes, it is.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.087
And when you told me
you were going to San Diego,

01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:02.438
I could tell that you were
still in your apartment.

01:14:04.222 --> 01:14:06.485
You were with him.
Weren't you?

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:09.749
[sobbing]
What do you want from me?

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.577
The same thing
I've always wanted.

01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:13.361
[inhales deeply]

01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:15.886
All of you.

01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:17.714
Molly?

01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:19.585
I'm gonna get you
Stuart's address.

01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:20.586
Okay.

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.502
Hey, uh...

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:24.721
You okay in there?

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.247
-[whispering] Tell her.
-Yeah.

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.031
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:33.512
O-okay.

01:14:36.515 --> 01:14:38.822
Uh...

01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:40.084
I'll see you out front then.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.217
Okay.

01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:51.704
Okay, now we're gonna go out
the back.

01:14:51.748 --> 01:14:53.445
-Right now.
-[sobbing]

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.186
Shh, don't worry.
Don't, don't fight.

01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:56.230
Don't fight, don't fight,
don't fight.

01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:59.016
Let go.

01:14:59.059 --> 01:15:01.584
All right, we're just gonna go
for a little ride.

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.380
[Stuart humming]

01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:23.954
Honey, we're home.

01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:30.221
-No...
-[honking]

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.962
[grunting]

01:15:32.005 --> 01:15:34.834
Don't do that again.

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.836
Please don't hurt me, Stuart.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.491
Jack. Please don't hurt me,
Jack.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.017
Sometimes we have to
hurt the ones we love.

01:15:45.453 --> 01:15:47.499
Don't put me
in that position.

01:15:49.762 --> 01:15:50.981
Let's go.

01:15:53.636 --> 01:15:56.203
Why, why did you do it?

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:58.771
You said you had too much
goin' on to have a relationship.

01:15:58.815 --> 01:15:59.990
[device beeping]

01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:01.295
Now you don't.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:05.082
[door opens]

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:07.040
[Molly] What are we doing
at Dylan's?

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:09.565
Dylan. Dylan.
It's always about Dylan.

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:11.697
You got him to install
an alarm system.

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.481
Maybe he can keep me
out of your place,

01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:14.918
didn't think
to keep me out of his.

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:16.484
What are you talking about?

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:21.446
Oh, my God, Dylan.
No!

01:16:21.489 --> 01:16:22.926
Please wake up.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:25.711
First chance you get,
you go to him.

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:27.060
What'd you do to him?

01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:28.584
You let him kiss you.

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:31.064
-[grunting]
-Stop it! No! Stop it!

01:16:31.108 --> 01:16:32.631
Stop it! Stop!

01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:33.719
[sobbing]

01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:35.721
[groans]

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:37.897
[Molly grunts]

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.291
Go, Molly!
Molly, run, he's crazy!

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:43.337
Oh, God. Stop it!

01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:44.687
Stop! Stop!

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.211
Stop! Please.

01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:48.342
Please.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.043
Please, Jack.

01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:59.005
Jack.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.706
Thank you.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.187
I knew you'd choose me.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.758
[sighs]

01:17:12.802 --> 01:17:14.064
Let's make sure
we don't get interrupted.

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:15.239
Let me please
just check on Dylan.

01:17:15.282 --> 01:17:16.849
I wanna make sure he's still...

01:17:16.893 --> 01:17:19.199
Him! Enough about him.

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.378
Now...

01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:26.685
I can reopen this scar.

01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:30.689
I don't want to.

01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:33.736
-[sobbing]
-But I can.

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.302
Please.

01:17:35.346 --> 01:17:37.087
Please. [sniffles]

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.350
I won't,
I won't mention him again.

01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:40.568
Promise.

01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:45.486
Okay.

01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:47.793
Okay.

01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:49.012
Good girl.

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:55.453
See, learning all about you
was really the key.

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:57.063
Once I got into your computer,
I knew

01:17:57.107 --> 01:17:59.413
I could be
everything you wanted.

01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:01.938
Everything you needed.

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.723
Your hard drive,
it showed me the way,

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:06.812
like a, like a road map.

01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:10.424
It revealed
everything you liked.

01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:13.819
And I knew
I could give it to you.

01:18:13.863 --> 01:18:16.256
Well, I am gonna treat you
so well.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.044
I am gonna make you
so, so happy.

01:18:21.087 --> 01:18:23.089
I promise.

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:24.438
You've been waiting for me all
your life,

01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:26.745
you just didn't know it.

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:29.617
But I'm here now...

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:32.882
and you are never
gonna regret choosing me.

01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:36.450
[scoffs] I'm gonna take
such good care of you.

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:37.930
We'll be together forever.

01:18:39.671 --> 01:18:40.716
Cheers...

01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:43.806
to our new life together.

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:44.894
[glasses clink]

01:18:52.205 --> 01:18:53.467
Drink.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.606
[chuckles]

01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:02.738
To our new life.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:07.090
See? I knew you'd come around.

01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:12.269
Oh, Molly.

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:14.967
[instrumental music]

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:17.404
[both moaning]

01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:22.235
-Oh, you feel so good.
-When I was born... Mm.

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:25.108
Oh, this is even better
than I imagined it would be.

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:27.763
Oh, hey. Hold that thought.

01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:29.112
Watch this.

01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:33.377
Now, I know a lot of people

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.466
don't believe in romance,
but I do, you know?

01:19:35.509 --> 01:19:38.295
And you deserve romance, Molly.

01:19:38.338 --> 01:19:40.166
So I'm gonna give it to you.

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.602
I'm gonna give it to you
every day

01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:43.866
for the rest of your life.

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:45.519
Here, I wanna show you
something.

01:19:49.132 --> 01:19:51.003
[sniffles]

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:52.788
I wanna show you something, too.

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:54.398
Okay, what?

01:19:55.965 --> 01:19:57.053
[sighs]

01:20:00.534 --> 01:20:03.537
Why don't we go to bed
and not get out for three days?

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:05.888
No, let's take a bath first.

01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.411
It looks amazing.

01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:10.849
[scoffs]

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.070
You look amazing.

01:20:14.113 --> 01:20:16.899
I wish there was room in there
for both of us.

01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:19.510
[dramatic music]

01:20:19.553 --> 01:20:21.120
But there's not!

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:25.472
[electricity crackling]

01:20:28.562 --> 01:20:30.651
[breathing heavily]

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.568
[groaning]

01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:37.528
[breathing heavily]

01:20:52.282 --> 01:20:54.284
-[grunts]
-[screams] Oh, God!

01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:00.246
[breathing heavily]
Oh, my...

01:21:03.554 --> 01:21:05.208
Oh, my God!

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:09.908
[sobbing]

01:21:09.952 --> 01:21:12.519
[mellow music]

01:21:31.364 --> 01:21:33.236
And if you guys just hit that
top right button,

01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:34.672
it'll take you
to Molly's Tips.

01:21:34.715 --> 01:21:36.282
[Ramona] This is so trippy!

01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:37.805
Did Ramona tell you,
we ran into a group

01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:39.633
in Switzerland
who already has the app.

01:21:39.677 --> 01:21:41.809
I can't believe
it's gone international.

01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:45.378
Ooh! 16,000 people have
downloaded it.

01:21:45.422 --> 01:21:47.293
Do you get money every time
someone downloads the app?

01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:48.991
No, but I got a promotion,
and I'm starting

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:50.993
another column in June.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.603
You know what I love?

01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:54.518
The fact that I literally have
a mini-Molly

01:21:54.561 --> 01:21:56.172
in my phone right now.

01:21:56.215 --> 01:21:59.610
-[Aaron] That's right.
-You all do.

01:21:59.653 --> 01:22:01.960
[Luther] These are for
the guest of honor.

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:05.311
-Oh, habanero! Yes.
-[Luther] Your favorite.

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:07.183
Thank you so much
for removing that review.

01:22:07.226 --> 01:22:09.185
I'm so glad my editor
had a connection.

01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:10.664
I mean, I would have
done anything.

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.450
[Molly] You know I love it here.

01:22:13.493 --> 01:22:15.408
-You are the best, Molly.
-Hm.

01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:17.323
[indistinct chatter]

01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:22.241
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:24.243
-Hey!
-Hello!

01:22:24.287 --> 01:22:25.984
-[Molly] It's okay.
-Hey, Dylan.

01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:28.334
-That's okay. You're here.
-What's up, guys?

01:22:28.378 --> 01:22:29.683
[Dylan groans]

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.381
Let me take this off.
Let me help you.

01:22:31.424 --> 01:22:34.471
Actually,
I got you a present.

01:22:34.514 --> 01:22:37.039
-[Dylan] Okay.
-Aw.

01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:39.432
So, I know it's not real,
but I did make it for you.

01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:41.130
[Ramona] Aw.

01:22:41.173 --> 01:22:42.566
It's beautiful.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:48.006
I also have this for you.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.225
-[chuckles]
-[Molly] What?

01:22:51.488 --> 01:22:52.837
[Dylan] All right,
so there's 14 of 'em.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.926
So there is enough
for your whole kitchen.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.536
Oh, my...

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.016
Did he just give her
a cabinet handle?

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.497
[laughs]

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.021
These are the vintage handles
from my old kitchen.

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:04.109
How did you--

01:23:04.153 --> 01:23:06.111
Yeah, I shamelessly bribed

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:07.765
the contractor.

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:08.984
-[laughing]
-That happens. Yeah.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.855
Oh, my God. Dylan.

01:23:10.898 --> 01:23:13.075
-I hear a wedding bell.
-Yeah.

01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:15.816
Listen, I'm just...
I'm so proud of you.

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.384
And your app,
and you're amazing, so...

01:23:18.428 --> 01:23:20.386
Seriously, you're amazing.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.867
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:25.174
But you're still gonna
live on nachos and cereal.

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:27.045
Oh, you better believe it.

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:29.091
That's definitely
still happening. [laughs]

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:30.570
He actually burned off
his eyebrows

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:31.528
the last time he used his stove.

01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:32.529
Oh, they were gone.

01:23:32.572 --> 01:23:34.313
It smelled so awful.

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:35.793
-It looks horrible.
-[Ramona] Kinda like you.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:37.360
So bad.

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:38.883
I'm starving.

01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.798
[cell phone chimes]

01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.669
[Angie] Mi amor.
[Ramona] Let's eat.

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:44.062
[Dylan]
What is creamy-freemy?

01:23:44.106 --> 01:23:45.716
[cell phone beeps]

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:47.544

01:23:47.587 --> 01:23:50.373
[indistinct chatter]

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:57.119
Hey, Molly, you all right?

01:23:57.162 --> 01:23:58.946
-Yeah. I'm-I'm fine.
-[Dylan] Yeah?

01:24:01.906 --> 01:24:03.734
-Okay. I need a glass of wine.
-[Ramona] Yes!

01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:05.083
[laughs]

01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:06.084
That's my main concern
right now.

01:24:06.128 --> 01:24:07.433
[indistinct chatter]

01:24:07.477 --> 01:24:09.174
Luther...

01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:10.610
Luther!

01:24:10.654 --> 01:24:12.351
To Molly's 20 Minute Meals.

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:14.179
[Aaron]
To Molly's 20 Minute Meals.

01:24:14.223 --> 01:24:16.616
-[Angie] Yes.
-Let him cheers.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.618
All right. Thank you.
I appreciate that.
