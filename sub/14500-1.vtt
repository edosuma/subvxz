40:59.240 --> 41:01.811
Bunzo...

45:15.080 --> 45:16.411
Good morning!

45:17.840 --> 45:19.842
Good morning, ma'am.
Welcome to Minnesota.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.921
Can I offer you some
free tourist information?

45:25.080 --> 45:27.884
Good morning. Can I offer you
some free tourist information?

45:37.880 --> 45:40.087
This is a state map.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.811
If I can get it open...

45:58.920 --> 46:02.090
- Now what did you say your name was?
- Oh, thank you.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.930
Kumiko.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.320
I'm Robert. This here is Brad.

46:05.480 --> 46:06.481
How do you do?

46:06.640 --> 46:09.970
First off, by law, we have to tell you
that we're not associated with the airport

46:10.160 --> 46:12.811
or the Minnesota Department
of Tourism in any way,

46:12.960 --> 46:15.042
but the airport is kind enough
to lease out this space

46:15.200 --> 46:18.522
so that we can offer assistance
to travelers such as yourself.

46:22.400 --> 46:27.611
Uh... how to go Fargo?

46:27.800 --> 46:29.290
- Fargo?
- Fargo.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.441
Fargo.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.449
Well... that's way up here.

46:32.640 --> 46:37.089
It's actually on the border
in North Dakota.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.766
And the way you get there

46:39.920 --> 46:42.810
is you start here in Minneapolis...

46:43.960 --> 46:50.650
and go right up 94.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.490
Do you know how to get there?

46:56.400 --> 46:57.640
No.

46:57.800 --> 47:01.122
It's okay to be lost.
That's why we're here.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.009
I was lost once.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.208
I was going down the wrong road.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.930
A depraved individual,

47:07.080 --> 47:09.890
much different than the man
you see in front of you today.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.486
But somewhere through
that haze of debauchery,

47:12.680 --> 47:14.762
I saw the light.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.161
Now there's some other groups here
that will offer you guidance.

47:17.320 --> 47:18.810
I know that there's some Methodists,

47:18.960 --> 47:21.008
and you don't see them too often,

47:21.160 --> 47:22.730
but the guys with the ponytail...

47:22.880 --> 47:24.484
Oh... "Harry Kishner."

47:24.640 --> 47:26.529
- Hare Krishnas.
- Believe it is.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.041
All good-intentioned, but...

47:28.200 --> 47:32.727
- and I'm not knocking any of them...
- How go to Fargo?

49:03.120 --> 49:04.770
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

49:04.960 --> 49:08.726
We're about an hour and a half
away from our destination,

49:08.920 --> 49:11.764
and as you can see,
we have a minor setback.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.968
Unfortunately, we have a flat tire.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.602
And my carpal tunnel prevents me
from addressing this problem,

49:17.760 --> 49:19.569
so we're gonna have to wait for backup,

49:19.720 --> 49:23.520
which hopefully will get here
in a timely fashion.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.048
If nothing else,
we'll get you transferred

49:27.200 --> 49:28.850
to another bus as soon as possible.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.331
So in the meantime,

49:30.480 --> 49:33.165
just feel free to get up
and stretch and whatnot.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.168
Can I help you?

50:51.400 --> 50:53.209
What are you doing?

50:59.720 --> 51:01.722
Can you hear me?

51:04.640 --> 51:06.324
Can I help?

51:28.000 --> 51:29.729
This is my home.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.929
It's okay.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.606
We'll get you where you need to be.

51:39.440 --> 51:42.728
I need to use the restroom
and take my pills.

51:44.280 --> 51:45.884
Come on!

51:47.320 --> 51:49.288
You can get all warmed up.

51:49.440 --> 51:53.286
I can barely feel my toes.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.765
I have cocoa.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.805
It's a hot chocolate drink.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.365
It is hot, so blow on it.

52:13.680 --> 52:14.966
Thank you.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.841
Are you an exchange student or...

52:33.320 --> 52:34.765
a tourist?

52:36.840 --> 52:38.285
Yes.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.924
Where's your home?

52:43.320 --> 52:45.402
Where are you from?

52:45.560 --> 52:46.641
Tokyo.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.328
Oh, Japan.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.124
Wow, that's a long way.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.569
My late husband was in the Korean War.

53:04.720 --> 53:07.326
You ever been to Korea?

53:07.480 --> 53:09.084
Yes...

53:16.720 --> 53:17.846
Oh.

53:19.440 --> 53:20.885
Where are you going?

53:26.360 --> 53:28.601
Now that's very interesting.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.801
I like crafts, too.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.201
Only I do doilies.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.966
I want to go Fargo.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.405
- Say again?
- Fargo.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.130
Fargo?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.565
That's too cold.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.804
That's no fun.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.922
This is not the right time of year
to go sightseeing.

53:57.080 --> 54:00.846
I mean, you should have really
picked someplace warm,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.570
like Florida.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.369
Did you ever read "Shogun"
by James Clavell?

54:10.400 --> 54:13.244
The book, and there
was a miniseries, too.

54:14.320 --> 54:17.608
It's a good one. It's about Japan.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.249
I think I have a copy.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.925
Paperback. I don't like hardbacks.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.447
Paperbacks are much easier to manage.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.329
Hardbacks are for show-offs.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.641
No, I've been to Puerto Rico...

54:32.800 --> 54:38.364
and Acapulco, Bahamas.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.568
I've been to London.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.121
Ireland.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.930
Here it is. I knew I had it.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.650
Paperback.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.690
Household dust.

54:49.840 --> 54:52.161
It's mostly just dead skin.

55:00.920 --> 55:04.970
Do you have DVD player?

55:05.120 --> 55:09.330
DVD? No, only VHS.

55:09.480 --> 55:13.007
And Canada, I've been there
dozens of times.

55:13.200 --> 55:16.249
And I went on a cruise once
with Charles.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.448
We went up to Alaska.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.763
We got to see neat whales and icebergs.

55:25.800 --> 55:30.249
Oh, that was a fun trip.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.689
Gets dark real early.

55:48.160 --> 55:51.209
Why don't you stay here tonight?

55:51.360 --> 55:53.966
I mean, your schedule
seems pretty flexible.

55:54.160 --> 55:56.128
And I'll warm up some leftovers.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.089
I have tuna casserole.

55:59.760 --> 56:04.243
- Um...
- No bones about it.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.448
We'll get up tomorrow

56:06.600 --> 56:08.921
and I'll show you around.

56:09.080 --> 56:12.562
It's no fun traveling alone anyway.

56:12.760 --> 56:17.641
Solitude? It's just fancy loneliness.

56:34.040 --> 56:37.283
This is my son Bobby's room.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.647
He lives in California now.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.484
Never comes to visit.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.129
He's pretty ungrateful.

56:49.560 --> 56:53.485
Tomorrow, you take me to Fargo?

56:53.680 --> 56:55.330
You don't wanna go there, hon.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.084
Trust me.

56:57.240 --> 56:59.208
I'll take you to the Mall of America.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.010
It's a lot more fun.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.969
They have an indoor Ferris wheel

57:03.120 --> 57:05.691
and a mirror maze.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.605
Now, you get a good night's sleep

57:08.760 --> 57:11.331
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

57:11.480 --> 57:13.289
Except for the sticky buns.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.601
They're for breakfast.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.285
Okay?

57:18.920 --> 57:20.684
Okay.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.763
Good night.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.401
$6.01.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.203
Good morning. How can I help you?

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.890
Check out, please.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.201
You want to check out?

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.482
What room number are you in?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.246
What's your room number?

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.528
- Two. Zero.
- Two? Zero?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.681
20.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.763
Here, let me check.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.244
I have a note here.
Your credit card declined.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.967
Your credit card did not go through.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.644
You have a bad credit card.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.088
Bad card.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.890
Yes.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.769
This is business card.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.606
This is your business card?
Did you want me to try one more time?

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.563
Nope, it declined again. It's bad.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.890
So you might have to call
your credit card company

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.361
to check what's going on with it.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.764
Or if you have another card
I will take it.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.880
What you want to do?

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.602
I go get money.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.645
Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.205
Hey!

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.420
I didn't mean to turn on the siren.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.670
I bumped it by accident.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:40.407
I got a call about a lady
wandering around in a blanket.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.904
Are you that lady?

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.284
Back there, that was Paul Bunyan
and Babe the Blue Ox.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.523
It's an American folktale
or something like that.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.324
Babe used to be anatomically correct,

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.921
but apparently some drunk guy went

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.811
and shot the statue's privates off
with a 12 gauge.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.246
I want to go Fargo.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.765
- Do what now?
- Fargo.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.564
I want to go Fargo.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.251
It's... it's a good ways away.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.362
It's not close.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.642
I discover that.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.651
So... what is that?

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.608
Jesus Christ.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.288
You're looking for the money

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.568
that was in this?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.888
That's what you're looking for?

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.042
I discover treasure.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.168
- Yeah.
- Right here.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.202
- Well...
- It's mine.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.721
Okay, well, you see...

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.404
this is not real.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.360
It's just pretend.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.000
Like, you know, like entertainment.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.726
Entertainment.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.403
It's not real like a documentary or news

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.131
or a reality show, or something.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.250
It's just...

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.006
it's just a normal movie.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.925
You know, fake. Like a story.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.411
No fake.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.601
Yeah, fake.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.240
No fake. It's...

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.441
And I know, I understand.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.080
But a documentary is real,

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.604
and a normal movie is fake.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.570
Not fake. Real.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.960
This is a normal movie.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.640
I discover treasure.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.609
Right here.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.128
Look, I...

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.807
Look, I want to help you.
I'm just trying to figure out how.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.606
Hi, can I help you?

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.761
Hello, ma'am.

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.169
My name is Deputy Caldwell
with the Sheriff's Department.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.321
- Okay.
- Not in this county,

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.005
- but that doesn't matter.
- Yes?

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.640
I'm here with this Japanese woman

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.686
who doesn't speak English
particularly well,

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.320
and so I was wondering
if you could possibly

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.244
translate a few things for us.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.165
I'm Chinese. I don't know any Japanese.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.000
- Not a...
- Not at all.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.568
Don't you know just
at least a couple sentences?

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.883
Only Mandarin. That is it.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.003
Very different.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.730
Kumiko?

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.885
What?

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.407
Do you speak any Chinese?

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.722
No. Japanese.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.405
Chinese.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.243
How's your meal?

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.324
Okay.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.289
You know, I was...

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.724
I was thinking about
those maps you have.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.804
And...

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.964
I bet a standard highway map
would clarify things a little better.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.610
You know?

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.489
I'm pretty sure I have one in the car.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.929
So why don't you sit tight
here for a second?

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.204
And I'll go check.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.930
I'll be back in a second.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.930
I found it.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.766
What's wrong?

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.848
You... you okay?

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.121
Here.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.644
I'm sorry you're so upset.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.330
I'm trying to think what to tell you.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.291
I think if we didn't have
this cultural barrier between us

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.842
that we could understand
each other clearly

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.162
and this would all make
a lot more sense.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.884
Hey, hey.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.527
Believe me,

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.523
I know how important this is to you.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.842
I've never been
to another country before.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.211
I can only imagine how strange

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.681
and confusing everything must be.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.124
Kumiko, I want you to know

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.807
that I'm going to help you, okay?

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.045
I wanna help you get what you need

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.965
and where you need to go.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.885
You're not in this alone,
you understand?

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.404
I am here to help.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.891
I understand.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.565
I'm not alone.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.130
You help me.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.290
Let me know if there's
a particular style you're going for.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.090
Because to be honest,

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.971
I really don't know
what's fashionable or not.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.004
So let me know what you see.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.405
If you find something you like,

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.769
I'm sure they'll let you
leave the blanket here.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.011
Let's try this one.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.610
It looks good.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.730
Okay.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.484
Seems it's not too tight.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.811
Okay.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.248
Where's your... right there?

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.168
That's where your toe is.
It should be fine.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.090
What'd you do that for?

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.840
You said you help me.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.085
Well, yeah, but not like that.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.407
I'm just trying to do my job
and that's all.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:57.527
You said you'd help me get treasure...

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.807
together.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.682
Well, no, you got me all wrong.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.604
I mean, I have a wife and two kids,

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:11.288
I mean, I'm just trying to help you.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.403
And the treasure's not real.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.769
It's just a regular, normal movie,

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.081
and that's it.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.801
It's fake, totally fake.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.882
It's not fake!

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.210
Wait. Just... will you listen to me?

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.964
Let me help you here!

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.764
Shit.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.682
Oh, come on.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.561
Fargo!

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.325
Fargo!

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.326
Fargo.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.322
Stop! Stop!

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.727
Stop! Stop!
