00:02.803 --> 00:04.543
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:04.605 --> 00:08.415
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:08.475 --> 00:10.215
the police
who investigate crime

00:10.277 --> 00:12.987
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.746
These are their stories.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.561
GAYDOS: That's the motor for the wipers, Einstein.
Check that one there.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.291
DWYER: Here, this has got to be it.
Give me the knife.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.356
What are you talking about?
This is the starter.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.095
So cut the wire here.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.800
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

00:35.903 --> 00:36.973
This your car?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.877
No. We just stopped to help.
I think it's a bad plug.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.280
So where's the owner
of this boat?

00:41.341 --> 00:42.841
We don't know.
It was just sitting there.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.320
Of course it was. Come on, hands
on the hood where I can see them.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.019
Hey, take it easy! We were just
trying to help. I swear to God.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.361
We were going to take it
to the pound.

00:51.685 --> 00:55.755
CAMPOS: This is 2-7-Charlie, location,
59th Street Bridge, westbound,

00:55.822 --> 00:58.532
signal, 10-15,
possible stolen vehicle.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.072
We didn't even steal nothing.
The car was here, broken down.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.838
The driver must have gone
and went to get a tow truck.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.667
Yeah, right.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.872
And he left the keys
on the floor?

01:08.402 --> 01:12.182
The Benz is registered to a Laura
Madsen, 135 Gramercy Park.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.119
We called the house. Phone was
answered by a Steve Martell.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.346
Identified himself
as Ms. Madsen's husband.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.792
He said he was asleep, and that he
doesn't know where his wife is.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.362
At 2:00 a.m.?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.787
Nice marriage.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.486
Hey,
you checked the gas stations?

01:27.554 --> 01:29.474
Both sides of the bridge.
No Ms. Madsen.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.473
Anyway, the Benz started up just fine.
Tank is half full.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.696
Thanks, bud.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.670
Messieurs Gaydos and Dwyer.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.269
A couple of high-beams
out taking the night air.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.472
Thought they found
Christmas in July,

01:40.534 --> 01:44.244
only they tried to hot-wire the car instead
of looking for the keys on the floor.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.975
They didn't teach you much
at Spofford.

01:48.775 --> 01:53.715
You know, the woman's shoes and
jacket were still in the front seat.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.121
Could be somebody grabbed her.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.961
Or she did a solo act.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.767
Hey, call the Harbor Unit,
we're going to need divers.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.366
East River.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.773
I'd rather eat a gun.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.114 --> 03:02.864
I just can't believe this.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.326
I mean, are you sure
that nobody has seen her?

03:05.385 --> 03:07.755
No one has seen her yet,
Mr. Martell.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.043
Did she tell you
she was going out last night?

03:12.092 --> 03:15.342
I came home late. I was
finishing a job up on 95th.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.343
I'm a painting contractor.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.142
Then I stopped off at Gibby's
on the East Side.

03:23.503 --> 03:26.643
I guess
I got home around 1:00.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.390
She wasn't here, and I just
figured she was working.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.985
And where would that be?

03:33.780 --> 03:37.390
Madsen Publishing on Madison.
Her family owns it.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.059
I called over there, and
she wasn't there, and I...

03:42.622 --> 03:44.932
I waited up for her
and I fell asleep.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.125
Has your wife
been upset lately?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.538
Just the usual.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.840
Work at the book company,
you know,

03:56.803 --> 03:58.613
Maggie's grades,

03:59.239 --> 04:00.979
but I didn't see this coming.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.811
It's very possible
we jumped the gun.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.316
No. I mean... No,
it does make sense.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.517
She did this before.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.691
Three or four years ago,
before I knew her.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.087
She's been going
to see a shrink.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.699
Is there anybody else she might have talked to?
A friend, a relative?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.800
I don't... I don't know.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.932
I mean, we're her family.
Maggie and me.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.377
I just can't believe
this is happening.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.347
I was at a school concert
at Alice Tully Hall.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.052
When I got home,

04:35.308 --> 04:36.688
Mom looked okay.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.857
Did she say anything
about going out?

04:39.913 --> 04:40.913
No.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.116
She just asked me
about the concert.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.156
And then I went to bed
around 9:30.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.173
Mom wants us to use these.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.135
Was anybody else around then?
A maid?

04:58.765 --> 05:00.505
Theresa goes home at 6:00.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.610
It was just Mom and me.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.692
I just want her to be alive.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.879
Yeah, right.
She drives to Queens,

05:15.949 --> 05:18.659
turns around, and then
takes a header off the bridge?

05:18.718 --> 05:21.358
Maybe she wanted to go
with a view of the Bronx.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.031
It doesn't add up.
There's no note.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.369
People check out.
They don't always say goodbye.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.195
She had
a 17-year-old daughter.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.330
I'd like to think
she'd make the time.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.696
LOGAN: Unless somebody
is rushing her.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.184
Laura Madsen is the sole heir
to Madsen Publishing.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.804
Fifty million bucks.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.639
You see evidence
of a kidnapping?

05:37.704 --> 05:40.414
BRISCOE: There's no forced entry.
The car is clean.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.943
And, unless you're getting psychic
messages, no ransom demand.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.051
Unless there's none
we know about.

05:46.112 --> 05:49.182
Sometimes families feel better
when we're not involved.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.800
This lady has done
a dry run before.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.962
Now maybe this time
she got it right.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.198
Talk to her shrink. See if she
was thinking about an encore.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.876
Laura Madsen is not
a candidate for suicide.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.812
She's too dedicated to her
daughter to abandon her.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.908
Well, now, hold on, because
we heard she had a history.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.675
Four years ago, she took
24 milligrams of Dilaudid.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.552
Not enough to kill herself.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.351
She had back pain.
She took the prescribed dose.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.747
She said later she forgot
and took another one.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.556
Still, she doesn't sound like
the happiest kid on the block.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.859
Her parents were gone. She'd lost
her younger brother to AIDS.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.302
She felt very vulnerable.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.528
She was especially concerned
about her daughter.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.103
Why? Were there problems?

06:35.161 --> 06:37.841
Laura was just
very afraid for her.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.438
She didn't want Maggie to go
through what she went through.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.950
Bad relationships,
a drug addiction.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.183
Yeah, can you tell me
specifically what kind of drugs?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.948
As I said, painkillers.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.150
But she overcame that problem
with her husband's help.

06:50.210 --> 06:54.490
He's a very strong presence. She felt
fortunate to have a man like him.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.815
Had she been burned before?

06:57.183 --> 06:59.323
Victor Conner.
Maggie's father.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.916
I can't give you any details,
but he put her through hell.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.089
Are they still in touch?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.567
They see each other
at least once a month

07:05.625 --> 07:08.765
when Laura drives Maggie to
Mr. Conner's home in Queens.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.543
It's horrible.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.205
I can't imagine what happened.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.407
LOGAN: What time
did you talk to her?

07:17.704 --> 07:20.554
Well, it must have been
just before 9:00.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.847
She called.
She thought Maggie was here.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.979
Your daughter told us
she was at a concert.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.025
She was probably three
nanoseconds late getting home.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.288
Not to speak ill,

07:31.351 --> 07:33.891
but Laura is the mother
of all mother hens.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.294
We argued about that.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.473
I believe Maggie should be
allowed to express herself.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.366
Childrearing? Is that what
your divorce was about?

07:43.229 --> 07:44.229
Lord, no.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.045
Marriage didn't bring out
the best in us.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.451
But that's all in the past.
Mr. Conner,

07:51.838 --> 07:55.678
you have no idea why your ex-wife's
car was found coming from Queens?

07:56.743 --> 07:59.663
I'm sorry, I don't. And you
were home all evening?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.554
Yes. I was waiting
for a car to La Guardia.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.420
I had an 11:30 flight
to Boston.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.486
I had an early morning meeting
with an author.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.125
You do books, too, huh?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.260
Yes. At Madsen Publishing.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.956
My office is just
two floors below Laura's.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.403
See, it was all very amicable.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.240
Mr. Conner
was flattering himself.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.506
He keeps an office here. Part
of the divorce settlement.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.350
Last year he put out a coffee-table
book on vintage cognac.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.821
Well, if I had to work with
one of my exes all day...

08:33.880 --> 08:35.690
Oh, they didn't work together.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.349
Laura handles new fiction.

08:37.417 --> 08:41.327
Seven titles this year, including two
on the shortlist for the Pulitzer.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.828
She has great intuition.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.959
Well, how's her intuition about
husbands like Victor Conner.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.666
Ms. Kessler,

08:51.064 --> 08:55.344
if you have anything to say about their
relationship, now is the time to do it.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.447
Well, Laura never complained,

09:03.510 --> 09:06.080
but she came in one day,
before the divorce.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.893
She had a bandage on her lip.
Her cheek was bruised.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.287
Yeah, let me guess, she ran into
a flying coffee-table book?

09:15.622 --> 09:17.832
Mr. Conner was a no-show
for a week.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.674
Draw your own conclusions.
LOGAN: Okay.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.238
After the divorce?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.436
Well, sometimes
I'd pass this office.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.168
The door was closed, but you could
hear them from down the hall.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.474
What did you hear?

09:29.536 --> 09:33.006
Well, last week it was about some
paper she wanted him to sign.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.776
I'm not sure what.
Something legal.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.846
SALLY: Laura was concerned
about Maggie's grades.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.895
She wanted her to do a year
at a school in Switzerland.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.901
But the custody agreement stipulates
that Maggie can't leave the state

09:47.954 --> 09:51.564
without Conner's approval,
which wasn't forthcoming.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.764
What, Conner figures his
signature is worth a few bucks?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.595
Tack on six zeros,
then you get the idea.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.744
It was pure blackmail.
Laura was incensed,

09:59.799 --> 10:01.539
and I told her
to let me handle it.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.811
Did she take your advice?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.749
Not in matters
that affect Maggie.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.554
Laura could be ferocious.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.090
I have to ask.
Ls Victor Conner a suspect?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.192
Well, until we find a body,

10:14.247 --> 10:16.517
we don't really know
that anybody did anything.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.793
You know,
we had the S.Jo..B. arrested.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.762
We heard a rumor
that he hit her.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.860
Rumor? Maybe you should
hear this for yourself.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.893
Eloise, would you bring in the
cassette in the Victor Conner file?

10:29.195 --> 10:31.265
It's the 911 call Laura made.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.614
LAURA: Please hurry!
He's coming up the stairs.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.476
I'm in the bathroom,
my daughter is with me.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.405
MAN: Ma'am, there is a patrol
car in your sector now.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.950
VICTOR: What are you doing
locking the damn door?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.576
Laura, open the door!

10:41.641 --> 10:43.781
Victor,
I'm talking to the police.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.850
Maggie, don't open the door!
Get away.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.052
Ma'am, tell him the police are on the way.
MAGGIE: Daddy, stop!

10:48.114 --> 10:49.924
He's drunk.
He doesn't give a damn.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.693
Victor, if you come in here...
Just open the door!

10:51.751 --> 10:53.561
I can hear a siren!

10:53.620 --> 10:54.690
(MAGGIE SCREAMING)

10:54.754 --> 10:56.674
Don't...
Give me that phone!

11:00.627 --> 11:04.037
So, he pled nolo
to misdemeanor assault.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.901
Hundred hours
of community service.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.343
But get this, he hosted
a charity tennis tournament.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.583
And the night
Laura Madsen disappeared?

11:12.639 --> 11:17.549
IUDs confirm one 10-minute call
from her house to Conner's at 8:55.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.154
Then, two hours later, he's got
the limo ride to the airport.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.194
LOGAN: Yeah, Gramercy Park
to Forest Hills Gardens,

11:23.249 --> 11:25.199
that's about a half an hour,
right?

11:25.251 --> 11:28.631
She goes there to ream his butt
over the papers for the girl.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.328
Conner is up to his eyeballs
in vintage cognac.

11:31.391 --> 11:35.131
This time, Laura Madsen
can't dial 911 fast enough.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.535
And he leaves her car on the
bridge to fake a suicide?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.212
Doesn't give him much time to
get back for the limo ride.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.546
Mr. Conner is a regular account.
Short rides to La Guardia.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.136
He likes to be picked up
45 minutes before flight time.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.379
Two nights ago, everything on schedule?
No, hardly.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.475
I get there at quarter to, ring
the bell, there's no Mr. Conner.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.919
He's usually waiting
in the hall with his bags.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.795
What time did he show?
I called him on my cellular.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.455
First time, I got his machine.
Second time, I got him.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.734
He said he'd be right down.
That was just after 11:00.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.604
The whole time
you were parked out front,

12:09.662 --> 12:11.402
did you see anybody
go in or out?

12:11.464 --> 12:12.704
No, I couldn't say.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.005
I was doing a puzzle
and watching the clock.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.508
So did Conner say
why he was late?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.740
Yeah, like he thinks
it's any of my business.

12:19.806 --> 12:23.016
All he told me was
to haul ass to the airport.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.877
LOGAN: It's cutting it close,
but it fits the time frame.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.264
Yeah, and then he puts the body in the
wine cellar while he flies to Boston.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.464
He could have ditched it
on the way to the bridge.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.796
You heard the tape, Lennie.
The guy smells right.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.502
Why, because he's got country
club written all over him?

12:38.524 --> 12:41.944
No, because he likes money, and
with the ex out of the picture,

12:41.961 --> 12:44.501
who gets custody of Maggie
and her 50 million friends?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.440
Yes? No, I'm waiting!

12:46.466 --> 12:49.106
Look, if Mom drove over to Dad's
in the middle of the night,

12:49.135 --> 12:51.615
don't you think Maggie'd know about it?
Maybe she did.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.208
On the tape, Maggie was
gonna let Conner in.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.480
She was 13, she was scared.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.789
Look, when Mom
wants to find Maggie,

12:58.811 --> 13:00.791
where's the first place
she's gonna look?

13:00.813 --> 13:03.233
Dad's.
Hello. Yes.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.060
Okay, we'll be right down.
And notify Steve Martell.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.686
They found her.

13:24.704 --> 13:25.444
STEVE: Laura.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.342
That's... That's Laura.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.548
Well, now we've got a body.

13:37.951 --> 13:41.091
Mom never said
that she was going to Dad's.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.900
Maggie, this is very important.
I know,

13:47.026 --> 13:48.656
but she didn't say.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.826
Maggie, if she mentioned anything
about your father that night,

13:52.865 --> 13:54.035
you have to tell them.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.165
We didn't talk about him.
I swear.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.314
Did you talk about why

13:59.339 --> 14:01.649
he wasn't letting you
go to school in Switzerland?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.754
Because he knew
that I didn't want to go.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.920
That's the reason.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.816
We heard the argument
was about money.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.032
So you think that's why he killed Mom?
To get her money?

14:13.052 --> 14:16.472
I'm afraid we have to consider everything.
Dad's not like that.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.989
He cares about what I want.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.300
Anyway, no one
can touch that money.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.369
It's in my trust fund
until I'm 30 years old.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.869
Cause of death
is an intracerebral hematoma

14:31.904 --> 14:34.544
caused by a fracture
of the right temporal bone.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.384
Your basic blow to the head.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.479
Any chance she got it doing
a half gainer off a bridge?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.292
You mean by hitting a piling?

14:42.048 --> 14:45.998
A body accelerates at 32
feet per second, per second.

14:46.019 --> 14:50.929
Over 200 feet,
speed at impact is 68 mph.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.397
Half her skull
would be missing.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.599
Sorry we asked.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.408
I looked at the lungs. No sigh
of hypoxemia, no atelectasis,

14:59.432 --> 15:02.212
no surfactant loss,
I.e. no drowning.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.735
This woman was dead
before she hit the water.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.952
The past two days, we've had
slack tides and slow currents.

15:09.976 --> 15:13.076
She goes in off the bridge, we're
going to find her mid-river

15:13.112 --> 15:14.752
just up from the Williamsburg.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.461
What if she was dumped on the
Queen's side, like Hunters Point?

15:18.484 --> 15:20.734
Well, she might get as far
as Wallabout Bay.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.393
But to end up on our side
she'd have to catch a ferry.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.803
Meaning she started out
in Manhattan.

15:26.826 --> 15:30.036
I put her going in about here.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.373
Between 14th and 23rd.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.069
Not my choice
for an afternoon swim.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.079
So, unless Conner keeps a
speedboat in Newtown Creek,

15:40.106 --> 15:41.676
I don't see
how he pulled it off.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.585
Well, cheer up, Mike. It doesn't mean
you have to start liking the guy.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.461
There might be someone closer
to home to dislike.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.431
Laura Madsen went in the water
10 blocks from her house.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.491
Okay, but everybody swears on a
stack it was the perfect marriage.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.272
I've worked for Mrs. Laura
for almost 20 years.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.735
She was very kind.

16:04.764 --> 16:08.644
Our daughters, they used to play
together when they were babies,

16:08.668 --> 16:11.768
and she always
treated us like a family.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.614
How was her family life?

16:13.639 --> 16:17.089
Oh, with Mr. Conner, it was no good.
He was a bum.

16:17.110 --> 16:21.860
But Mr. Martell, he's a real man.
He works for a living.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.521
That's all it took
to make her happy?

16:23.549 --> 16:25.889
He saved Mrs. Laura.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.458
They met at a clinic.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.867
Mrs. Laura was taking a lot
of pills because of her back,

16:31.891 --> 16:35.301
and he was there because
he was drinking too much.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.808
But she got better
because of him.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.000
What about him?
Did he stay on the wagon?

16:40.032 --> 16:42.012
I never saw him drinking.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.074
Mr. Martell has values.

16:44.103 --> 16:49.023
He visits his parents every week
and he took Mrs. Laura to church.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.581
And she said he was
a good influence on Maggie.

16:51.611 --> 16:56.081
You know, he said he was working
late the night she disappeared.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.815
So was that a regular thing with him?
I don't know.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.701
I leave at 6:00, and Mr. Martell
keeps his own hours.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.432
Seems they both did, Mrs. Aguilar.
Mr. Martell told us

17:06.459 --> 17:10.098
when he came home at 1:00 that
night, his wife wasn't there.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.108
Maggie was alone in the house?

17:15.334 --> 17:17.214
That must be a mistake.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.766
Mrs. Laura would never
leave Maggie alone.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.714
Okay, well, listen,
thank you very much.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.051
Appreciate it.
Thanks.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.259
Hey, Maggie is 17 years old.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.923
She still needs Mommy around
in case she has a nightmare?

17:32.952 --> 17:34.832
Look, maybe Mommy
wanted to be around.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.774
You heard the shrink,
she was mother superior.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.669
Oh, look,
the maid leaves at 6:00.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.301
How would she know
what goes on?

17:40.326 --> 17:40.526
Hey, in my first marriage,

17:40.593 --> 17:44.203
our cleaning lady knew about
our divorce before I did.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.910
I mean, if she says her boss stayed
home all night, she probably did.

17:47.934 --> 17:51.184
Okay. Martell said he worked at
95th and Second until midnight.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.194
Good, I want to find out
if he got that part right.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.884
Don't ask me why, but he
wanted to finish it himself.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.480
"Don't worry," he says, "I'll have
it done if it takes all night."

18:00.513 --> 18:02.253
This look done to you?

18:02.281 --> 18:05.231
Well,
maybe he ran out of paint.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.291
Hey, when I left at 6:00, he had
enough paint for 100 Rembrandts.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.961
When I came back at 9:00,
he was gone.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.226
Did you find out where he went?

18:12.258 --> 18:15.068
I damn well tried. I wanted
to terminate his butt.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.734
I called this apartment
he has over at Bleecker.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.143
I got his damn machine.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.795
Wait a minute,
he's got an apartment?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.513
Yeah, he does his business
out of there.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.735
Anyway, I tried him at home.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.550
His wife didn't have a clue
where he was.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.713
Oh, so you spoke
to Laura Madsen?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.092
Yeah, she wasn't happy
to hear from me.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.221
I guess she thought Martell
was busy working.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.457
You got the address
of that apartment?

18:37.483 --> 18:38.933
Yeah, I'll get it for you.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.873
Okay, that's two lies
for Martell.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.199
I'm not giving up on him, okay?

18:46.225 --> 18:48.635
Right,
your working-class hero.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.513
We're looking
for a Steve Martell.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.479
He's not here.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.847
Ever since that thing with his
wife, he hasn't been around.

19:03.876 --> 19:07.846
I never met her myself,
but I hear she was okay,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.880
you know,
as far as rich people go.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.156
Steve tell you that?

19:11.183 --> 19:13.663
MAN: No, he's not into
the family chitchat.

19:16.555 --> 19:17.825
It's cozy.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.797
Somebody live here?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.305
Steve did,
before he got married.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.168
It's rent control.

19:24.196 --> 19:28.936
Guess he didn't want to give
it up, you know, just in case.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.968
Yeah? What were the odds
on the "just in case"?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.508
Come on, the guy is my boss.
Hey!

19:38.544 --> 19:41.464
You want to be difficult, huh?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.320
We'll start all over
down at the precinct.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.349
You better call your wife, 'cause
you won't be home for dinner.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.424
No.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.560
Wait, it's like this.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.829
You paint houses,
you meet a lot of housewives.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.303
Steve takes advantage.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.098
Well, who was the flavor
this month?

19:58.130 --> 20:01.300
Brunette, young, real pretty.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.344
I don't know her name. I saw her here
last week when I was driving up.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.320
She was getting in a cab.
What about Tuesday night?

20:07.340 --> 20:09.080
Was he here then?
Yeah.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.918
I didn't expect him.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.483
I stopped by to pick up some
supplies for an early job.

20:13.512 --> 20:17.622
Steve tells me to come back later.
Man needs his space, you know.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.130
What time was later?

20:19.151 --> 20:22.621
I swung by around 10:00. Lights were out.
Nobody answered the door.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.825
I went home.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.496
I didn't want to walk in
on anything.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.335
Well, so much for
the rags-to-riches marriage.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.395
That's too bad.
I had high hopes for this guy.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.214
That's lie number three. You
want to try for number four?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.047
Next stop, Gibby's bar.

20:42.541 --> 20:46.821
He showed up about 12:30 out of the blue.
He said he had to use the john.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.086
Only time I see him here
is when he has work for me.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.745
I moonlight for him
on my days off.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.853
You think he had
something else on his mind?

20:52.885 --> 20:54.085
I thought maybe
he had a fight with his wife.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.760
You know, a guy is here, but he
wants to be home, but he can't.

20:56.789 --> 20:57.819
Yeah, I know the dance.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.337
Did Steve go around the ring
very often with his wife?

21:00.359 --> 21:01.629
We're not that familiar.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.231
Ever since
he's been on the wagon,

21:03.262 --> 21:05.572
he pops in maybe once a month
for a club soda.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.508
So after he taps a kidney, what then? Nothing.
He just left through the back.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.010
What, he parked in the alley?

21:13.038 --> 21:15.538
You mind if we take a look?
Free country.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.460
He's five minutes from Gramercy Park.
He can't hold it in that long?

21:24.483 --> 21:27.933
So he parks back here.
What's the attraction?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.663
Dumpsters

21:29.688 --> 21:31.068
for dumping.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.868
Empty. They must have
come through this morning.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.829
Lennie.

21:45.871 --> 21:46.941
Look at that.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.946
Must have torn off when
they emptied the dumpster.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.517
It's white canvas,

21:54.046 --> 21:56.686
and that looks like
paint to me.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.315
We just want to
get inside the house.

21:59.351 --> 22:03.271
You're just assuming it was the
crime scene A judge won't buy it.

22:03.289 --> 22:06.459
Look, the wife knew
that Martell ditched work.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.372
She was probably waiting
with a frying pan.

22:08.394 --> 22:11.204
Yeah, except she's the one
who got her brains scrambled.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.340
And he rolls her up in a drop cloth
for the ride to the East River?

22:14.366 --> 22:15.896
LOGAN: That's what I'd do.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.805
Fine, show me the drop cloth,
and I'll get you a warrant.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.938
We traced the dumpster
through the carting company.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.953
That load went straight
into the incinerator.

22:22.975 --> 22:26.885
But Forensics analyzed the
paint on the piece of canvas.

22:26.912 --> 22:30.762
It's the same composition as the
brand that Steve Martell used.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.893
So it was a painter's
drop cloth.

22:32.918 --> 22:36.128
It doesn't mean it was Martell
who put it in the dumpster.

22:36.155 --> 22:40.465
Look, Martell's told more fibs than
my eight-year-old. Isn't that enough?

22:40.493 --> 22:41.673
Maybe.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.704
As long as I catch
Judge Fraser after his nap.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.872
We picked up a faint blood patch on the
carpet, just outside the bathroom.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.642
Most likely from the bottom
of somebody's shoe.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.711
The real deal is in here.

22:54.740 --> 22:59.660
Luminol brought up traces of blood
protein on the tile grout in the floor.

22:59.678 --> 23:02.018
Well, at least he tried
to clean up after himself.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.747
Well, he forgot to wash
behind his ears.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.852
We found the drop of the fresh blood
right under the lip of the soap dish.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.126
With a nice, fat thumb-print
right next to it.

23:10.156 --> 23:13.296
As big a fan as I am
of forensic science,

23:13.325 --> 23:15.235
I doubt they can
date blood stains.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.831
For all you know, Laura Madsen stepped
on a piece of glass five years ago.

23:18.864 --> 23:22.184
Yeah, well, Forensics are
pretty good about thumbprints.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.911
But can they tell you

23:23.936 --> 23:26.876
if the print was put there at
the same time as the blood?

23:26.906 --> 23:30.316
I don't think so, or Mr. Martell
would be under arrest right now.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.412
Oh, well. There's plenty
of time for that.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.424
What cinched it for you,
Martell?

23:34.446 --> 23:37.786
Your wife threaten to kick you out
with nothing but your paint cans?

23:37.816 --> 23:40.516
At least now we know
what this is really about.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.563
If my client's blood was as
blue as Victor Conner's...

23:43.589 --> 23:47.559
Victor Conner doesn't live within
pitching distance of the East River.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.103
I didn't kill Laura.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.899
How stupid do you think I am?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.101
Well, we know which head
you do your thinking with.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.383
If you weren't home
killing your wife, Steve,

23:57.403 --> 23:58.513
maybe you should tell us

23:58.537 --> 24:00.777
what you were doing
between 10:00 and midnight.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.286
I wasn't home.

24:02.308 --> 24:05.758
If you don't believe me,
ask Maggie. She knows.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.263
I was in my room.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.064
I'm on the third floor. I can't
hear anything from up there.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.898
So your stepfather could have come
home, and you wouldn't hear him.

24:18.924 --> 24:22.064
He wasn't there.
I know he wasn't there.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.274
Why can't you just believe him?
Why should we?

24:25.297 --> 24:28.337
He lied to us.
He lied to your mother.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.347
He was having an affair
practically under her nose.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.378
What's wrong, Maggie?

24:34.406 --> 24:36.506
Are you afraid of Steve?

24:36.542 --> 24:39.722
Did he tell you he'd hurt you
if you told the truth?

24:39.745 --> 24:40.845
No.

24:41.547 --> 24:44.047
Steve would never hurt me.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.870
What makes you so sure?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.071
I lied to you.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.197
I didn't get home at 9:00.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.639
I got home just before 12:00.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.544
Steve dropped me off.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.551
Mom wasn't there.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.824
Steve came home later.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.278
You were with Steve?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.187
Mom always treated him
like a servant.

25:21.220 --> 25:25.830
But I love him.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.310
Her husband and her daughter.

25:36.335 --> 25:39.505
If Laura Madsen weren't already
dead, this would have killed her.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.248
The media is lapping it up.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.843
Publishing heiress,
working class husband.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.616
A hell of a story. JACK: They'll
love Martell's version.

25:46.645 --> 25:51.145
While he's in bed with Maggie, his
wife is killed by a gang of elves

25:51.183 --> 25:53.463
who mop up the blood
and cart the body away.

25:53.485 --> 25:57.015
You think the girl would lie to protect
the man who killed her mother?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.226
Yes,
if they're acting together.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.968
Or if she doesn't
want to be next.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.966
You have a fingerprint?

26:03.996 --> 26:08.206
It only proves Martell was in the bathroom
before or after his wife's murder.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.983
We're not giving the Grand Jury
much to sink their teeth into.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.284
While we're dotting the "I's,"

26:13.305 --> 26:15.975
nothing is stopping Martell
from leaving the jurisdiction.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.418
Clip his wings.

26:18.444 --> 26:22.594
STEVE: Okay, this is base boards,
that's the window trim, all right?

26:23.916 --> 26:27.226
Now what? Haven't I seen
enough of you guys?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.252
Be happy. You get
the rest of the day off.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.388
What are you talking about?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.872
Steven Martell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Laura Madsen.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.372
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.474
Anything you say can and
will be used... Come on.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.866
Against you in a court of law.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.397
You have the right
to an attorney.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.972
Martell barely managed
to post bail.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.141
Barely?

26:45.170 --> 26:49.680
Marrying the Madsen fortune gave him
bragging rights, but not much else.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.418
His wife kept him
on a monthly allowance.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.823
It's all here
in their pre-nup.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.446
Volume one and volume two.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.986
My mother was right.

26:59.017 --> 27:02.897
Marry a rich girl and expect
to work hard for the money.

27:02.921 --> 27:05.201
Martell may have
the last laugh.

27:05.224 --> 27:09.474
Unless we break his alibi, he just has to
sit tight until the will clears probate.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.570
It's all up to Maggie.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.144
She said she went to a concert?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.380
Let's start there.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.309
MISS VINCENT:
It was a horrible tragedy.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.581
The media camped outside
the school all last week

27:25.611 --> 27:27.251
just to catch a glimpse
of Maggie.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.019
I feel just terrible for her.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.718
If you could just tell me
what happened at the concert.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.390
Yes. It was a Chopin recital.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.919
Three nocturnes
and a polonaise. Bad call.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.196
At least my girls
had the manners not to snore.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.326
Did Maggie stay till the end?

27:43.362 --> 27:45.972
No. She didn't make it
to the first intermission.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.278
The girl next to her said she was
in the bathroom, feeling sick.

27:50.302 --> 27:54.252
I looked for her, but she'd left.
So I called her mother.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.653
Did Maggie often skip class?

27:56.675 --> 28:00.085
No. I couldn't ask
for a better student.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.092
Well, her grades are spotty,
but not for lack of trying.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.355
She's always eager to please.

28:05.384 --> 28:10.234
Frankly, I doubt it would occur
to her to be any other way.

28:10.255 --> 28:14.665
I'd like to talk to the girl
who covered for her.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.833
It wasn't really a lie.
She was in the bathroom.

28:17.863 --> 28:18.933
She was changing.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.534
She was hooking up
with her boyfriend.

28:20.566 --> 28:21.936
She didn't want to go
looking like a geek.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.947
Well, did she mention
what they were planning to do?

28:23.969 --> 28:26.039
Well, I can guess.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.381
Besides the obvious.

28:28.407 --> 28:32.117
Her mom was expecting her home at 9:00.
I doubt they had time for much else.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.954
Anyway, she was dressed for it.

28:33.979 --> 28:37.089
Black dress, spaghetti
straps, fishnet stockings.

28:37.115 --> 28:41.525
Total killer. And the FM
shoes, four-inch heels.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.163
Definitely a statement.

28:43.188 --> 28:47.258
You know, this guy was the first
serious boyfriend Maggie had.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.502
Her mom never let her
go out with anybody.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.068
Did she complain
about her mother a lot?

28:52.097 --> 28:53.767
Maggie said that if she could,

28:53.799 --> 28:56.539
her mom would put a LoJack
around her neck.

28:56.568 --> 29:00.378
Sounds like a pretty typical mother.
She was a trip.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.645
Last semester, Maggie was
with me when I got my tattoo.

29:03.675 --> 29:08.055
Anyway, she decided she wanted one on her ankle.
A little black kitten.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.650
A week later, she comes in
with a bandage over it.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.794
Her mom had a doctor
burn it off.

29:15.821 --> 29:18.831
How did Maggie take it?
Was she angry?

29:18.857 --> 29:21.237
I think Maggie
was scared of her mom.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.540
Like this school in Switzerland,
Maggie didn't want to go.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.672
I told her to stand up for herself.
But she wouldn't.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.678
She never got anything
she wanted.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.480
Like the stuff that she wore
for her boyfriend.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.922
She had to borrow everything from me.
Where are those clothes now?

29:33.939 --> 29:37.819
She gave them back to me
the day after her mom died.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.953
I told her it was no hurry.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.429
Forensics found blood traces

29:42.447 --> 29:44.927
on the right heel of the
pantyhose Maggie was wearing.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.730
They matched it
to her mother's blood.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.862
Martell must be proud
of his little Maggie.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.297
She just graduated from
girlfriend to accomplice.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.803
Why not give her
all the credit?

29:53.825 --> 29:56.355
You really think she's capable
of killing her mother?

29:56.395 --> 29:58.565
They were competing
for the same man.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.737
Imagine the jealousy,
the anger...

30:00.766 --> 30:04.866
I can certainly imagine Laura
Madsen's outrage when she found out.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.413
If I were Maggie,
I would have run for cover.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.079
Everything I've heard tells
me Maggie was a ticking bomb.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.988
If her mother confronted her,
she might have lost control.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.621
Laura Madsen might have
forgiven her daughter,

30:15.647 --> 30:18.687
she'd never forgive Martell.
He had the most to lose.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.217
If anyone lost control,
my bet is it's him.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.733
Martell is the only boyfriend
Maggie has had.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.565
If that relationship was threatened,
there's no telling what she'd do.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.662
I'm not minimizing
her feelings for him.

30:29.695 --> 30:34.005
I want to know how far
she'd go to protect him.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.772
Have her arrested.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.745
Margaret Conner, you want to
step over to the car, please?

30:42.774 --> 30:44.054
Why? What do you want?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.216
You're under arrest for the
murder of Laura Madsen.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.945
No. What are you doing? You have
the right to remain silent.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.891
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.057
Do you understand that?

30:55.687 --> 31:00.097
I don't see how you conjured up
probable cause for this arrest.

31:00.125 --> 31:03.295
Your own witness said that Maggie
wasn't home when she called her.

31:03.328 --> 31:07.368
If I was busy cleaning up after a murder,
I wouldn't answer the phone, either.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.849
You should be more careful
where you step, Miss Conner.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.869
And I wouldn't
pat myself on the back.

31:12.904 --> 31:16.284
Your crack Forensics team
left open the possibility

31:16.308 --> 31:18.248
that blood belonged to any one

31:18.277 --> 31:21.447
of 80,000 people
in the five boroughs.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.620
Give it a few weeks.
The DNA will narrow the field.

31:25.651 --> 31:26.931
This is unbelievable.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.932
Why are you tormenting her?

31:29.955 --> 31:32.985
Mr. Conner, you are here
strictly as a courtesy.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.765
You have no standing in this case.
I'm her father, damn it!

31:35.794 --> 31:39.874
I want that pervert behind
bars for what he did to her.

31:39.898 --> 31:43.278
I'd like to put him behind bars for
what he did to your former wife,

31:43.301 --> 31:45.651
but that's up to your daughter.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.450
I don't know what you're talking about.
We weren't there.

31:52.811 --> 31:57.691
Mr. Wheeler, I don't relish
putting lovesick girls in prison,

31:57.716 --> 32:02.186
but unless your client stops lying,
that's exactly what I'm going to do.

32:02.220 --> 32:06.830
I don't know who killed my mother.
I don't know anything about it.

32:09.461 --> 32:13.071
(PHONE BUZZING)

32:15.167 --> 32:16.197
Yes?

32:22.007 --> 32:23.037
All right.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.221
If you'll excuse me a moment.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.263
Let's get
the ground rules straight.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.928
My client pleads guilty
to obstruction. Period.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.768
What he did, he did out
of fear and compassion.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.334
And for God and country.

32:44.362 --> 32:47.212
What have you got to say,
Mr. Martell?

32:47.232 --> 32:51.652
Okay, you have to understand
that I never touched Maggie.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.170
It was all in her head.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.115
Now, I let her come
to my office that night

32:55.140 --> 32:58.680
'cause I wanted to tell her to
stop this crazy infatuation.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.590
But she got all dressed up.
See, she had the wrong idea.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.424
So do you. You're up for
murder, not statutory rape.

33:06.451 --> 33:08.331
I came home around 1:00.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.521
Laura was lying
on the bathroom floor.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.427
She was dead.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.699
Maggie was crying.

33:16.728 --> 33:20.508
Laura had found this black
dress in Maggie's gym bag.

33:20.532 --> 33:24.482
She accused Maggie
of being a slut.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.753
Laura was a real piece of
work when it came to Maggie.

33:27.773 --> 33:32.423
Anyway, there was a fight.
Maggie said she pushed Laura.

33:32.444 --> 33:37.524
Laura had slipped. I don't think
Maggie meant to kill Laura.

33:37.549 --> 33:41.519
I said we had to call the police.
She said no.

33:41.553 --> 33:45.703
She said if I didn't help her,
she'd say I did it.

33:45.724 --> 33:50.804
I wasn't thinking.
I was scared out of my mind.

33:50.829 --> 33:54.969
You were scared of a 17-year-old girl?
Well, why not?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.350
When she told you we had an affair,
you believed her, didn't you?

33:58.370 --> 34:00.540
Like we believe you now.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.022
While Maggie was fighting with
her mother, where were you?

34:04.042 --> 34:07.822
He was at a bar, as he
originally told the police.

34:07.846 --> 34:10.416
That still leaves a few hours
unaccounted for.

34:11.283 --> 34:14.293
I was spending the evening
with a friend.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.029
A woman.

34:17.054 --> 34:21.025
Someone I care about very much.

34:26.630 --> 34:30.771
I met him five months ago. I was
redoing the master bedroom.

34:30.802 --> 34:35.081
Rearranging deck chairs on the
Titanic, as it turns out.

34:35.106 --> 34:40.646
Steve was very understanding.
Very attractive.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.059
It was all unexpected.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.121
The night his wife was killed,
you were with him?

34:46.150 --> 34:47.721
My husband was out of town,

34:47.752 --> 34:51.172
and Steve was over
for an intimate dinner.

34:51.188 --> 34:53.168
I wanted to cook for him.

34:53.190 --> 34:57.771
And dinner went on until what time?
I'm not sure.

34:57.796 --> 35:01.676
We'd had a bottle of wine.
It was sometime after 12:00.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.810
I wish I could be more exact,

35:03.835 --> 35:07.835
but I wasn't wearing a watch,
neither was Steve.

35:07.872 --> 35:12.692
Mrs. Whitburn, Mr. Martell has been
under suspicion for quite some time.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.621
Only now it occurs to you
to come forward?

35:16.481 --> 35:19.361
Steve didn't want
to compromise my marriage.

35:20.552 --> 35:25.802
Now it doesn't matter. My husband
found a hotel bill last week.

35:25.824 --> 35:30.674
It was a long time in coming, and
I was tired of all the lies.

35:30.695 --> 35:34.535
You see,
I am in love with Steve.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.740
You're lying. We can show
you their statements.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.719
I don't care.
You don't care?

35:39.738 --> 35:40.578
Thanks to this woman,

35:40.605 --> 35:43.705
he's got an airtight alibi that
leaves you as the only suspect.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.352
Maggie, he even denies
you two were having an affair.

35:46.378 --> 35:50.048
He said you made it up. I know Steve.
He loves me, not her.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.791
That's enough, Maggie.
Come on, we're leaving.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.058
Miss Conner,
you're only 17 years old.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.496
Do you really want to spend the rest of
your life in jail for Steve Martell?

35:58.523 --> 36:00.033
First you have to convict her.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.798
Is that the advice you're giving her?
Watch me.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.596
Maggie, for God's sake, tell
them what they want to hear.

36:03.628 --> 36:04.868
Leave me alone.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.466
You don't know Steve.

36:07.499 --> 36:11.779
You don't know him at all.
He'll prove you're wrong.

36:11.803 --> 36:15.013
You'll see. He loves me.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.520
What is the matter
with this girl?

36:17.542 --> 36:20.612
She's obviously in love.
Desperately in love.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.955
As much as she is in denial.
Can you blame her?

36:23.982 --> 36:26.462
Every aspect of her life
was controlled by her mother,

36:26.484 --> 36:27.994
almost to the point of cruelty.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.729
Martell was her lifeline
to the outside world.

36:30.755 --> 36:32.255
Not to mention
sleeping with him

36:32.290 --> 36:34.930
was a wonderful way of saying
Happy Mother's Day.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.770
She had every wrong reason
for getting involved with him.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.777
Is it possible she'd kill
her mother over him?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.940
I don't think so. But she
might lie to protect him.

36:43.968 --> 36:46.878
She has a lot invested. She
won't give up on him easily.

36:46.905 --> 36:50.475
How do we get her to face the truth?
Nothing works like reality.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.418
If she thinks her white knight is
going to come through for her,

36:53.445 --> 36:55.385
wait till she sees him
under oath.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.123
And that means you intend to
put her on trial for murder?

36:58.149 --> 37:02.759
Well, Adam, we know she was there.
At a minimum, she's an accomplice.

37:02.787 --> 37:07.257
You're talking about cutting a deal
with someone you believe is a perjurer.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.802
We don't know for a fact
Martell is lying.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.868
Don't bother inviting me
to your disbarment party.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.708
This tactic of yours has a wonderful
chance of blowing up in your face.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.375
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.248
STEVE: Maggie never went out
on dates.

37:25.277 --> 37:29.517
Laura was worried that she'd, you know,
get mixed up with the wrong crowd.

37:29.548 --> 37:35.258
I guess that's why she got fixated on me.
I was there.

37:35.287 --> 37:38.927
How did she express her fixation?
She gave me gifts.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.627
She left notes in my clothes.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.470
It was embarrassing.

37:43.762 --> 37:49.642
I had to set her straight. That's
why you saw her that night?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.838
To straighten her out?
Yes.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.580
Is that all that happened
between the two of you?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.452
Mr. Martell?

38:07.052 --> 38:11.132
Your Honor, permission to
treat as a hostile witness?

38:12.324 --> 38:13.364
Go ahead.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.841
Mr. Martell,

38:15.360 --> 38:19.470
did you make love with
Maggie Conner that evening?

38:19.497 --> 38:21.527
No.

38:21.566 --> 38:26.346
I just sent her home in a cab.
Then what did you do?

38:26.371 --> 38:31.451
I had dinner with a friend,
Christine Whitburn.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.216
In a prior sworn statement,

38:34.245 --> 38:39.555
you said that Mrs. Whitburn is a
person that you care about very much.

38:39.584 --> 38:43.964
Do you care about her
more than Maggie Conner?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.369
Yes.

38:51.396 --> 38:55.306
Now, when you got home
later that night,

38:55.333 --> 38:57.243
you found your wife dead?

38:58.269 --> 39:00.409
Laura was lying
on the bathroom floor.

39:00.438 --> 39:05.388
Where was Maggie? Maggie was
sitting on our bed crying.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.950
She told you she killed your
wife, isn't that right?

39:15.086 --> 39:17.286
Maggie, I'm sorry.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.162
I tried...

39:18.189 --> 39:22.329
Mr. Martell, you will direct
your answers to the court.

39:27.565 --> 39:31.265
Maggie said that Laura
and her were arguing.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.182
She said that she pushed Laura.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.115
In your statement, you said

39:37.142 --> 39:40.722
that she threatened
to implicate you

39:40.745 --> 39:45.385
unless you agreed to help her
dispose of the body.

39:45.416 --> 39:50.126
Is that right?
Yes.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.755
Is that the only reason
that you helped her,

39:51.789 --> 39:52.999
because you were afraid of her?

39:53.024 --> 39:55.804
Yes. Maybe I felt
sorry for her.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.670
Thank you. No more questions.

40:07.572 --> 40:08.782
Mr. Wheeler?

40:08.973 --> 40:13.953
If it pleases the court,
we request a short recess.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.690
Granted. Court will take
a 30-minute recess.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.264
MAGGIE: It isn't at all
like he said.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.064
I didn't imagine things.

40:31.496 --> 40:35.966
That night, we did go to bed.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.914
It was only our third time.

40:46.344 --> 40:48.554
He said that he loved me.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.396
And that he would
always be there for me.

40:55.753 --> 41:00.033
When I got home, Mom busted me.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.443
I was so tired of her
always riding me.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.444
I just wanted to rub it
in her face.

41:15.573 --> 41:19.153
Steve was the one thing that I
had that she couldn't take away.

41:20.545 --> 41:23.025
Mom just...

41:25.583 --> 41:28.533
As soon as I said it,
I wanted to take it back.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.798
Steve came home

41:37.829 --> 41:39.869
and Mom let him have it.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.738
She wanted him
out of the house,

41:42.767 --> 41:46.477
and I said
that I would go with him.

41:49.607 --> 41:51.307
She went crazy.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.952
She screamed that she would
leave him with nothing.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.593
She started hitting him.

42:02.387 --> 42:05.157
And he punched her
and he threw her.

42:07.425 --> 42:11.165
And she hit her head,
and I saw all of this blood.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.637
And Steve told me
to stop screaming.

42:20.805 --> 42:24.615
He said that the cops would
say that we both did it.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.415
I was in love with him.

42:29.447 --> 42:33.617
I did what he told me.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.331
We cleaned up the blood,

42:45.730 --> 42:47.940
and Steve took Mom away.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.735
WHEELER: Steve Martell
preyed on her, Jack.

42:53.771 --> 42:57.411
He even borrowed money from
her to pay for his lawyer.

42:57.442 --> 43:00.652
This girl is not a killer.

43:02.113 --> 43:05.153
Give me a good reason
to believe her.

43:05.183 --> 43:09.863
What do you want? A trial by fire?
She doesn't have any Polaroids.

43:09.887 --> 43:13.157
You just have to
take her word for it.

43:13.191 --> 43:17.941
I'm sorry, Mr. Wheeler. I'm going
to need a little more than that.

43:17.962 --> 43:22.542
Jack, there is a way
she can prove it.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.018
(PHONE RINGING)

43:30.708 --> 43:32.418
I don't know why
you've brought me here.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.153
I've already
given you my statement.

43:34.178 --> 43:37.748
Mrs. Whitburn, I suggest you listen
closely to what Miss Conner has to say.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.262
Maggie.

43:39.284 --> 43:43.464
Please tell us about the first time
you and Mr. Martell made love.

43:43.488 --> 43:46.798
She lied from the beginning,
she's going to lie again.

43:46.824 --> 43:48.064
JACK: Sit down.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.004
Maggie, go ahead.

43:57.835 --> 44:01.175
We were in Sag Harbor.

44:01.205 --> 44:04.345
Mom was in New York.

44:04.375 --> 44:07.745
It was a Saturday.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.779
Steve and I were in my room.

44:13.117 --> 44:15.647
I don't know how much
you want me to say.

44:15.687 --> 44:17.757
As much as you feel
comfortable with.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.439
He kissed me.

44:23.461 --> 44:29.671
He said that he liked
the way my skin felt.

44:31.703 --> 44:34.083
He started to undress me.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.545
And then?

44:36.574 --> 44:39.324
We got down on the bed.

44:39.844 --> 44:43.454
He kept kissing me.

44:46.717 --> 44:51.027
He said that he wanted me to be on
top, so that he could see more of me.

44:53.057 --> 44:57.367
He pulled me to him and
whispered things in my ear.

45:00.164 --> 45:05.014
How he didn't feel good enough to have
someone like me make love to him.

45:05.036 --> 45:08.976
He wanted me
to keep my eyes open,

45:09.006 --> 45:12.416
to keep looking down at him.

45:12.443 --> 45:16.983
He said it turned him on.
That's enough.

45:17.014 --> 45:18.994
Sound familiar does it,
Mrs. Whitburn?

45:19.016 --> 45:21.086
Christine,
you can't believe any of this.

45:21.119 --> 45:23.759
I lied.

45:25.456 --> 45:27.986
He wasn't with me that night.

45:32.697 --> 45:34.567
I'm leaving.

45:34.599 --> 45:38.009
I can't look at him anymore.

45:42.640 --> 45:47.060
You said that you would never hurt me.
You stupid little...

45:47.078 --> 45:48.488
BOWDEN: Steve, shut up.

45:48.512 --> 45:52.192
Mr. McCoy, we made a deal.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.526
I haven't forgotten,
Mr. Bowden.

45:54.552 --> 45:57.762
Two years probation
for obstruction.

45:57.789 --> 46:01.019
He can serve it concurrent
with 25 for man one.

46:01.025 --> 46:05.055
He has till Monday
to make up his mind.

46:11.402 --> 46:15.282
Once Christine Whitburn recanted,
Martell didn't have a leg to stand on.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.446
Eight and a third-to-25 years?

46:17.475 --> 46:19.915
Hardly seems enough for what
that man did to that family.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.954
You spend your whole life
protecting your kids from harm,

46:22.980 --> 46:26.260
then a distinguished citizen
like Martell comes along.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.064
He didn't just come along.

46:28.085 --> 46:31.065
He was invited in.
