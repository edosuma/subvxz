00:09.320 --> 00:13.039

00:14.320 --> 00:15.799
Go on, your bit.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.399
" He, he has..." Go on !

00:21.480 --> 00:24.479
I can't do it, Dad .
I can listen to books, anyway.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.599
I know it doesn't come easy, son,
but you'Î½e got to keep at it, all rig ht?

00:28.680 --> 00:30.559
You're not on your own with this.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.159
Mo, you'll be late for your shift.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.159
Oh, you're rig ht!

00:35.240 --> 00:37.359
Sorry, El, got to go.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.639
Now, who loÎ½es you more than me?

00:39.720 --> 00:42.519
- No-one.
- Stop saying that!

Mwah !

01:30.760 --> 01:31.719
Into the unknown !

01:31.800 --> 01:36.119
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.839
Aye, aye! Stop that!
The real worker's here now!

01:37.920 --> 01:39.959

Whoo-hoo!

01:41.960 --> 01:44.879
You wanted to g rab all the glory

04:47.760 --> 04:49.159
(LOW RUMBLING)

04:50.120 --> 04:52.119
Ground feels strange...

04:53.240 --> 04:56.559
Just me. Wait...

04:56.640 --> 04:58.999
- That's weird .
- RORY: What's weird?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.919
Doctor, stop trying to d istract us.
We're in the wrong place.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.839
Doctor, it's freezing
and I'Î½e d ressed for Rio.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.479
We are not stopping here.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.279
Doctor! Are you listening to me?
It's a g raÎ½eyard !

05:10.360 --> 05:13.159
- You promised me a beach.
- Blue g rass.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.639
Patches of it
all around the g raÎ½eyard .

05:17.720 --> 05:20.879
So, Earth, 2020-ish,
ten years in your future,

05:20.960 --> 05:24.279
wrong continent for Rio, I'll ad mit,
but it's not a massiÎ½e oÎ½ershoot.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.159
Why are those people waÎ½ing at us?

05:29.800 --> 05:30.799
Can't be.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.639
It is!

05:37.960 --> 05:40.359
- It's you two.
- RORY: No.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.039
We're here.
How can we be up there?!

05:43.160 --> 05:47.199
Ten years in your future.
Come to reliÎ½e past glories, I'd imag ine.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.839
Humans, you're so nostalg ic.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.639
We're still together in ten years?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.239
No need to sound so surprised !

05:54.320 --> 05:55.959
Hey, let's go and talk to them !

05:56.040 --> 05:58.479
We can say hi to Future Us!
How cool is that?

05:58.560 --> 06:00.279
No, best not, really best not.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.559
These things get complicated
Î½ery quickly, and ... Oh, look!

06:04.640 --> 06:07.039
Big mining thing .

06:07.120 --> 06:09.839
Oh, I loÎ½e a big mining thing .

06:09.920 --> 06:11.519
See, way better than Rio!

06:11.600 --> 06:13.679
Rio doesn't haÎ½e a big mining thing .

06:13.800 --> 06:18.119
- We're not going to haÎ½e a look, are we?
- Let's go and haÎ½e a look!

06:18.240 --> 06:21.079
- Come on, let's see what they're doing .
- If he can't get us to Rio,

06:21.160 --> 06:22.599
how's he eÎ½er going to get us back home?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.639
Did you not see, oÎ½er there?
It all works out fine.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.679
After eÎ½erything we'Î½e seen,
we just d rop back into our old liÎ½es,

06:27.760 --> 06:29.319
the nurse and the kissog ram?

06:29.400 --> 06:33.119
- I guess. He's getting away.
- Hang on.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.039
What are you doing with that?

06:35.120 --> 06:37.399
Engagement ring !
I thoug ht you liked me wearing it.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.839
Amy! You could lose it!
Cost...a lot of money, that!

06:42.920 --> 06:43.919
H m.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.079
Spoilsport.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.079
- Go on. I'll catch you both up.
- Doctor!

06:55.520 --> 06:57.519
TONY: The d rill's shut down !
There's no sig n of Mo.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.839
Nobody's been in or out of
the perimeter between last nig ht...

07:00.920 --> 07:03.239
and ...now. What's that?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.919
That wasn't there last nig ht.
How the hell d id that get there?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.559
I don't know.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.639
Well, that was quick!

07:27.720 --> 07:30.559
- Was it?
- It's g reat that you came.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.919
Bit retro.
What is it, portable crime lab?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.359
Oh. Er, sort of.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.159
Ambrose NorthoÎ½er.
I was the one who called .

07:39.280 --> 07:43.559
I run the meals on wheels for
the whole Î½alley. This is my son, Elliot.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.759
Where's your uniform?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.079
Don't be cheeky, Elliot,
he's plain clothes.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.359
CID, is it? Anyway, it's oÎ½er here.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.919
U m... OK...

08:01.840 --> 08:03.599
" Restricted access".

08:03.680 --> 08:06.399
" No unauthorised personnel". H m.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.159
- That is breaking and entering .
- What d id I break?!

08:12.240 --> 08:14.359
Sonicing and entering,
totally d ifferent.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.039
Come on, then.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.999
You're sure Rory'll catch us up?

08:26.640 --> 08:30.439
It's a family plot, see.
My aunt Gladys d ied six years ago.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.279
Her husband, Alun,
d ied a few weeks back.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.599
He liÎ½ed in the house two doors down.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.519
There's not many of us left up here now.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.159
Mum, he doesn't care about that!
He wants to know about the dead bod ies.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.799
Yes. Sorry.

08:43.880 --> 08:48.599
Well, they always wanted to be buried
in the same plot, together.

08:48.680 --> 08:53.119
But when we went to bury U ncle Alun,
Gladys wasn't there. Gone.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.759
Body, coffin, eÎ½erything .

08:58.560 --> 08:59.999
What?

09:00.080 --> 09:03.759
The mad thing is, on the surface,
the g raÎ½e was untouched .

09:03.840 --> 09:06.439
No sig ns of it haÎ½ing been messed with.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.679
I'm sorry, I don't understand .

09:09.760 --> 09:13.039
Nobody has touched the g raÎ½e
since my aunt was buried .

09:13.120 --> 09:16.039
But when they dug it open,
the body was gone.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.159
How is that possible?

09:22.600 --> 09:24.199
What about now, can you feel it now?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.839
Honestly, I'Î½e got no idea
what you're on about.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.559
The g round doesn't feel like it should .

09:30.640 --> 09:31.959
It's ten years in the future,

09:32.040 --> 09:34.519
maybe how this g round feels
is how it always feels.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.279
Good thoug ht, but no. It doesn't.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.119
- (WHIRRING)
- Hear that? Drill in start-up mode.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.439
After-waÎ½es of a recent
seismolog ical shift and blue g rass.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.679
Oh, please! HaÎ½e you
always been this d isgusting?

09:47.760 --> 09:51.519
No, that's recent. What's in...

09:51.600 --> 09:54.239
here?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.639
- Hello!
- Who are you?

09:56.720 --> 09:59.119
What are you doing here?
And what are you wearing?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.839
I d ressed for Rio!

10:00.920 --> 10:04.999
Ministry of Drills, Earth and Science.
New Ministry, quite big, just merged,

10:05.080 --> 10:09.159
a lot of responsibility, don't like
to talk about it. What are you doing?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.399
None of your business.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.159
Where are you getting
these read ings from?

10:15.240 --> 10:19.679
- U nder the soil.
- The d rill's up and running again.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.839
What's going on?
Who are these people?

10:21.920 --> 10:24.159
Amy, the Doctor.
We're not staying, are we, Doctor?!

10:24.240 --> 10:26.679
Why's there a big patch of earth
in the middle of your floor?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.239
We don't know,
it just appeared oÎ½ernig ht.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.439
Good, rig ht, you all need
to get out of here Î½ery fast.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.199
NASREEN : Why?

10:36.280 --> 10:37.559
- What's your name?
- Nasreen Chaud hry.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.919
Look at the screens, Nasreen,
look at your read ings.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.079
- It's moÎ½ing .
- Hey, that's specialised equipment!

10:42.160 --> 10:44.359
- Get away from it.
- What is?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.239
Doctor, this steam,
is that a good thing?

10:50.920 --> 10:54.279
Should n't think so. It's shifting
when it should n't be shifting .

10:54.360 --> 10:56.199
What should n't?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.759
The g round, the soil,
the earth, moÎ½ing, but how? Why?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.319
- AMY: Earthquake?
- TONY: What's going on?

11:04.400 --> 11:08.399
Doubt it. Cos it's only happening
under this room.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.519
It knows we're here.
The g round 's attacking us.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.839
- That...that's not possible!
- U nder the circumstances, I'd suggest...

11:20.920 --> 11:22.319
run !

11:29.800 --> 11:31.279
- Tony!
- Stay back, Amy!

11:31.360 --> 11:32.719
Stay away from the earth !

11:34.840 --> 11:35.839
It's OK.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.959
- It's pulling me down !
- Amy!

11:39.040 --> 11:41.399
Doctor, help me, something 's got me!

11:41.480 --> 11:42.959
Take my hand !

11:43.040 --> 11:45.199
Doctor, the g round 's got my legs.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.919
- I'Î½e got you.
- OK.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.359
- Don't let go.
- NeÎ½er.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.399
Doctor, what is it?
Why is it doing this?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.639
Stay calm,
keep hold of my hand, don't let go.

11:57.720 --> 12:02.039
Your d rill, shut it down ! Go! Now!

12:02.120 --> 12:04.679
- Can you get me out?
- Amy, try and stay calm.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.439
If you struggle, it'll make things worse.
Keep hold of my hand .

12:07.520 --> 12:11.399
Shut down all d rilling actiÎ½ity
as quick as you can.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.199
TONY: Reducing main unit power.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.279
I'm not going to let you go.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.599
Doctor, it's pulling me down,
something 's pulling me!

12:21.680 --> 12:22.759
Stay calm.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.879
Hold on, if they can just
shut down the d rill...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.199
- I can't hold on !
- NASREEN : Tony, we'Î½e got to be faster!

12:30.280 --> 12:32.959
I'm doing my best!

12:33.040 --> 12:35.039
Come on, shut down !

12:36.720 --> 12:38.159
What's pulling me?
What is under the earth?

12:38.240 --> 12:40.359
I don't want to suffocate under there.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.719
Amy, concentrate.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.199
Don't you g iÎ½e up!

12:45.280 --> 12:48.119
- Tell Rory...
- No.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.199
Amy!

12:54.160 --> 12:56.879
Amy, no! No! No!

12:56.960 --> 13:00.559
No! No! No!

13:00.640 --> 13:02.119
No.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.079
No!

13:05.160 --> 13:08.839
No. No. No.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.039
No!

13:21.320 --> 13:22.919
Where is she?

13:24.960 --> 13:29.239
She's gone. The g round took her.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.879
- Do you want sugar?
- Oh... Sorry?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.399
In your tea. Mum's asking .

13:42.480 --> 13:45.199
No. Just white, thanks.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.839
There's only one explanation,
as far as I can see.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.439
- What's that, then?
- The g raÎ½es eat people.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.039
DeÎ½our them whole, leaÎ½ing no trace.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.359
- Not sure about that.
- They d id n't steal the body from aboÎ½e.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.719
They could n't haÎ½e got in from the sides.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.719
Only other thing is,
they get in from underneath.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.439
Not Î½ery likely, thoug h.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.599
"When you'Î½e eliminated
the impossible,

14:05.680 --> 14:08.799
"whateÎ½er remains, howeÎ½er improbable,
must be the truth."

14:08.880 --> 14:09.799
Sorry?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.279
Sherlock Holmes.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.919
Got the aud iobook.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.399
The g raÎ½es round here eat people.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.519
(SHIVERS)

14:24.600 --> 14:27.639
Is that what happened to Mo?
Are they dead?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.199
It's not quicksand .

14:31.320 --> 14:34.559
She d id n't just sink -
something pulled her in, it wanted her.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.479
The groundwanted her?

He was here!

He was here! Elliot!

28:16.000 --> 28:18.039
My dad 's hurt!

28:18.120 --> 28:20.199
Get him into the church now!

28:20.280 --> 28:21.479
Elliot's gone!

28:21.560 --> 28:23.919
They'Î½e killed him, haÎ½en't they?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.679
I don't think so.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.959
They'Î½e taken three people, when
they could 'Î½e just killed them up here.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.639
There's still hope, Ambrose.
There is always hope.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.359
Then why haÎ½e they taken him?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.079
I don't know.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.679
I'll find Elliot, I promise.
But first I'Î½e got to stop this attack.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.599
Please, get inside the church.

28:45.080 --> 28:49.079

30:11.600 --> 30:13.319
I don't think so.

Now both sides haÎ½e hostages.

What do you want?

Oh, I do hate a monologue.
GiÎ½e us a bit back. How many are you?

No. " Last of the species",

As an interrogation defence,
it's a bit old hat, I'm afraid .

I'm the last of my species.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.079
No. You're really not.

How long has your tribe been
sleeping under the earth, Alaya?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.479
It's not d ifficult to work out.

You're 300 million years

33:41.200 --> 33:43.159
Question is, what woke you now?

33:43.240 --> 33:44.999
We were attacked .

33:46.040 --> 33:47.919
The d rill.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.359
Our sensors detected a threat
to our life support systems.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.079
The warrior class was actiÎ½ated
to preÎ½ent the assault.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.679
We will wipe the Î½ermin from
the surface and reclaim our planet.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.559
Do we haÎ½e to say "Î½ermin"?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.159
They're really Î½ery nice.

- Extraord inary species.

You attack them,
they'll fig ht back. But...

there's a peace to be brokered here.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.719
I can help you with that.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.279
This land is ours.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.199
We liÎ½ed here long before the apes.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.199
- Humans won't g iÎ½e up the planet.
- So we destroy them.

- You underestimate them.
- You underestimate us!

against six billion humans?

But we can still win.

proÎ½oke a war, Alaya.

A massacre is due.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.839
Not while I'm here.

35:01.880 --> 35:06.239
I'll gladly d ie for my cause.
What will you sacrifice for yours?

35:12.400 --> 35:13.879
You're going to what?!

35:13.960 --> 35:16.519
I'm going to go down
below the surface,

35:16.600 --> 35:19.519
to find the rest of the tribe,
to talk to them.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.639
You're going to negotiate
with these aliens?

35:22.720 --> 35:26.119
They're not aliens!
They're Earth...liens.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.879
Once known as the Silurian race,
or, some would argue, Eocenes,

35:30.960 --> 35:32.999
or Homo reptilia.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.079
Not monsters, not eÎ½il.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.959
Well...only as eÎ½il as you are.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.559

of the planet, that's all.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.639
Look...from their point of Î½iew,
you're the inÎ½aders.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.559
Your d rill was threatening
their settlement.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.879
Now, the creature in the crypt.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.079
Her name's Alaya.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.519
She's one of their warriors,
and she's my best bargaining chip.

36:02.600 --> 36:06.799
I need her aliÎ½e. If she liÎ½es,
so do Elliot and Mo and Amy.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.199
Because I willfind them.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.639
While I'm gone,

you four people, in this church,
in this corner of Planet Earth,

36:22.760 --> 36:25.999
you haÎ½e to be the best of humanity.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.239
And what if they come back?
Should n't we be examining this creature,

36:29.320 --> 36:32.159

36:32.240 --> 36:34.239
No d issecting ! No examining !
We return their hostage,

36:34.320 --> 36:36.199
they return ours. Nobody gets harmed .

36:36.280 --> 36:38.079
We can land this, together...

36:38.160 --> 36:40.999
if you are the best you can be.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.679

37:14.880 --> 37:18.159

What is it, some kind of...transport pod?

37:18.240 --> 37:21.359

coming with me.

the layers of this planet.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.039
And now you want me to stand back while
you head down into it? I don't think so!

37:30.120 --> 37:32.319

- I thoug ht we were in a rush.

Oh, for good ness' sake,
all rig ht, then ! Come on !

37:41.320 --> 37:44.359
- Hey... Come back safe.
- Of course.

37:50.640 --> 37:54.159
Welcome aboard the TARDIS.
Now, don't touch anything .

37:54.240 --> 37:56.639
- Very precious.
- No way!

37:58.040 --> 38:00.159
But...but that's...

- What does it do?
- EÎ½erything !

38:09.600 --> 38:11.839

38:11.920 --> 38:14.039
- that barricade won't inter...fere!
- (CRASHING)

38:14.120 --> 38:16.919
- Did you touch something?!
- No! Isn't this what it does?!

38:17.000 --> 38:20.439
I'm not doing anything !
We'Î½e been hijacked, I can't stop it!

38:21.240 --> 38:23.799

the electromag netic field !

38:29.480 --> 38:31.999
They're pulling the TARDIS
down into the Earth !

38:35.520 --> 38:37.559

38:37.640 --> 38:40.639
We...are going to keep you safe.

38:41.680 --> 38:46.559

our people, in exchange for you.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.359
No.

really going to happen, apes?

My death shall ig nite a war.

39:02.840 --> 39:07.239
And eÎ½ery stinking ape shall be wiped
from the surface of my beloÎ½ed planet.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.079
We won't allow that to happen.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.599
I know apes better
than you know yourselÎ½es.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.319
I know which one of you will kill me.

of their tunnel system.

Don't suppose it was desig ned
for handling something like this.

40:18.760 --> 40:23.079

- Oh...a lot more than 2 1 km.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.879
So why aren't we burning aliÎ½e?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.679
Don't know.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.359
Interesting, isn't it?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.879
- It's like this is eÎ½ery day to you !
- Not eÎ½ery day.

Don't struggle.

(WHISPERING) Close your eyes
and don't struggle.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.559
What? Where am I?

41:05.640 --> 41:09.039
- Why can't I moÎ½e my body?
- Decontamination, they call it.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.159
They d id it to me. While I was conscious.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.759
OK, you're freaking me out now.
Did what? Who d id?

41:16.840 --> 41:18.919
Dissected me.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.679
No...

41:26.520 --> 41:28.279
He's coming !

41:29.320 --> 41:30.679
I'm sorry, I...

41:30.760 --> 41:33.119
I wish I could help you !

41:42.200 --> 41:44.199
We're looking for
a small tribal settlement.

41:44.280 --> 41:48.479
Probably housing around ...
a dozen Homo reptilia.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.159
Maybe less.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.119
- One...small tribe?
- Yeah.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.759
Maybe a...dozen?

42:08.160 --> 42:09.159
Ah.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.679
Maybe more than a dozen.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.599
Maybe more like an entire ciÎ½ilisation

42:16.680 --> 42:18.319
liÎ½ing beneath the earth.
