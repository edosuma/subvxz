20:59.127 --> 21:02.348
OK, LISTEN,
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF DINNER RIGHT NOW.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
REALLY? WELL, I'M NOT.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.613
BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY
IS OUT IN HALF
MY APARTMENT.

21:06.613 --> 21:09.180
THE REFRIGERATOR IS OUT
AND MY ELECTRIC STOVE.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.965
THAT PLUMBER
THAT YOU SENT TO ME

21:10.965 --> 21:13.054
PLUGGED IN HIS
SNAKING THING
INTO A CRUMMY OUTLET

21:13.054 --> 21:14.490
AND BLEW MY FUSES.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.536
OK, I'LL BE UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.233
I WANT YOU UP NOW!

21:18.233 --> 21:21.062
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO FEED MY DAUGHTER
ON TIME

21:21.062 --> 21:22.585
ONCE THIS WEEK.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.239
IS THAT TOO MUCH
TO ASK?

21:24.239 --> 21:26.502
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU GOT TO CHANGE YOUR TONE.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.722
OK? THIS IS AN OLD BUILDING

21:28.722 --> 21:30.854
WITH CRAPPY WIRING
AND EVEN CRAPPIER PIPES.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.509
YEAH? AND MAINTENANCE
TO MATCH.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.903
OH, WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
YOU JUST MOVE, LADY?

21:35.903 --> 21:38.471
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
WHY DON'T I CALL
THE LANDLORD

21:38.471 --> 21:40.037
AND TELL HIM HOW YOU
TREAT YOUR TENANTS?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.691
FINE! I DON'T CARE.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.040
CALL HIM.
I'M HAVING DINNER.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.172
GOOD-BYE.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.785
LET'S EAT.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.766
REED,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:12.766 --> 22:15.725
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE, LIKE, RUNNING
WITH THE BALL OR WHATEVER?

22:15.725 --> 22:17.858
IT'S JUST
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAD TO TELL YOU.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.990
REED, EVERYBODY'S--

22:19.990 --> 22:21.818
FORGET ABOUT THEM.

22:22.993 --> 22:23.907
IT'S JUST--

22:25.344 --> 22:27.302
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOU, CLAUDIA.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.176
OH, REED.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.962
REED.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.572
CHARLIE!

22:39.009 --> 22:40.402
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:40.402 --> 22:43.100
THE PEPTO.
WHERE'S THE PEPTO?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.711
ARE YOU OK?

22:44.711 --> 22:45.973
I DON'T KNOW.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.369
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
WRONG WITH ME, CLAUD.

22:50.369 --> 22:55.025
I'M EXHAUSTED,
BUT I CAN'T SLEEP,
AND MY STOMACH...

22:57.680 --> 22:58.899
I NEED SOME AIR.

22:58.899 --> 22:59.987
COULD YOU MAYBE--

22:59.987 --> 23:01.162
OK.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.431
YOU'RE SCARING ME,
CHARLIE.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.868
YEAH, ME, TOO.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.305
AND THE PEPTO?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.487
SO, WHAT IF SHE TALKS
TO HANK FIRST?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.924
THEN SHE TALKS
TO HANK FIRST, AND
WE TALK TO HIM SECOND.

23:23.924 --> 23:24.925
WE EXPLAIN
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.842
LOOK, ONCE HE HEARS
HER ON THE PHONE,

23:28.842 --> 23:31.105
HE'S GOING TO KNOW
SHE'S SOME KIND
OF NUT CASE, RIGHT?

23:31.105 --> 23:33.455
COULDN'T WE JUST PLUG UP
HER PIPES OR SOMETHING

23:33.455 --> 23:36.023
AND LET SEWAGE
EXPLODE ALL OVER
EVERYTHING SHE OWNS?

23:36.023 --> 23:38.939
YES, AS SOON AS
I LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT PLUMBING.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.941
NO, I MEAN IT.
BAILEY, REALLY.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.638
IF SHE TRIES TO GET US
KICKED OUT OF HERE,
IT'S WAR.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.161
IT'S US
AGAINST HER.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.380
RIGHT.
AND WE
SHOULD TAKE

23:45.380 --> 23:47.077
ALL OF THE ENERGY
THAT WE USE

23:47.077 --> 23:49.079
TO DEVOTE TO
CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS
LIKE SCHOOLWORK,

23:49.079 --> 23:51.081
AND INSTEAD, APPLY IT
TO AN ELABORATE PLAN

23:51.081 --> 23:53.997
TO DRIVE HER
OUT OF HER MIND
AND APARTMENT 14.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.305
DEAL.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.394
GOOD.
NOW CALL HANK.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.483
I'M GETTING ATTACHED
TO THIS APARTMENT.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.492
DANIEL, UH, THIS WAS
IN THE MAILROOM.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.233
OH, YEAH, YEAH,

24:12.233 --> 24:14.670
THOSE ARE THE
HANDOUTS FOR THE
PANEL DISCUSSION.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.194
YOU CAN JUST SET
THOSE...SOMEWHERE.

24:23.549 --> 24:27.030
KIND OF THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE FOUNDERS' GALA.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.206
IT'S TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT?YEAH.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.645
RUBBER CHICKEN,
MY FAVORITE.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.951
I DON'T KNOW. IT SOUNDS
KIND OF GREAT, ACTUALLY.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.998
I MEAN, WEEKLY'S GOING
TO BE THERE. KQED.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.479
WELL, I GUESS
I'M A LITTLE JADED.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.046
WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.180
WELL, THEN,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:46.180 --> 24:47.268
YOU SHOULD COME.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.227
WHAT?

24:50.227 --> 24:52.055
ME? YOU'RE KIDDING.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.187
IT'LL BE A PART
OF THE DOCENT'S JOB

24:53.187 --> 24:54.841
DEALING WITH
THESE PEOPLE.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.799
WOULDN'T HURT FOR ME
TO SEE YOU IN ACTION.

24:56.799 --> 25:01.021
WOW! UH, THAT'D BE--

25:01.021 --> 25:04.198
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.

25:04.198 --> 25:08.158
YEAH, OF COURSE,
I'M SERIOUS.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.639
BESIDES, I'D HAVE
A LOT MORE FUN
IF YOU'RE THERE.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.034
OK.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.820
WHAT'D THE DOCTOR SAY?

25:17.820 --> 25:19.343
I MEAN, HE ONLY TALKED TO ME
FOR ALL OF, LIKE, 5 MINUTES.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.258
HE JUST TOLD ME
TO TAKE SOME BLOOD.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.173
HERE. KEEP PRESSURE
ON THIS.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.697
WELL, COULD YOU
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE TESTING FOR?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.002
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT
TO BE IN THE FILE.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.438
THEY REALLY
WON'T KNOW ANYTHING

25:27.438 --> 25:28.788
UNTIL THEY LOOK AT
YOUR BLOOD AND URINE.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.051
I'M GOING TO NEED
SOME URINE.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.139
WHERE DO I GO?

25:32.139 --> 25:34.228
TO THE BATHROOM.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.056
HERE'S YOUR I.D.
CODE FOR THE BLOOD
AND URINE TESTS.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.101
CALL THIS 800 NUMBER
IN 24 HOURS.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.581
THEY MIGHT HAVE
YOUR RESULTS BACK
BY THEN.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.626
MIGHT?

25:40.626 --> 25:41.757
JUST KEEP ON THEM.

25:44.325 --> 25:48.155
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
YOU KNOW, GRIFFIN.
MAKE LUNCH, I MEAN.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.070
HOW ELSE WAS I
SUPPOSED TO SEE YOU?

25:50.070 --> 25:51.724
YOU KEEP CANCELING
DINNER ON ME.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.290
I'M SORRY.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.683
THINGS ARE REALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.250
I KNOW.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.905
BUT YOU GOT
TO TAKE A BREAK
ONCE IN A WHILE.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.515
SO GUESS WHAT?

26:00.515 --> 26:03.083
A GUY DOWN
AT THE SHOP

26:03.083 --> 26:06.390
GAVE ME
A LEAD ON SOME
FOO FIGHTER TICKETS.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.479
TOMORROW NIGHT.
SO, I WAS
THINKING THAT--

26:08.479 --> 26:09.742
TOMORROW?

26:11.439 --> 26:13.049
GRIFFIN,
I CAN'T TOMORROW.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.398
I HAVE THIS--
THIS THING FOR WORK.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.357
AGAIN.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.664
WHAT THING?

26:18.664 --> 26:23.277
THE FOUNDERS' GALA.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT,
AND THEY INVITED ME,

26:23.277 --> 26:25.671
AND I CAN'T NOT GO.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.629
I REALLY THINK THIS WILL
HELP ME GET THE JOB.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.588
OH.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.415
OH.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.766
THEN, MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST
GO WITH YOU, THEN.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.550
I MEAN, I KIND OF
FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO MAKE A DATE

26:35.550 --> 26:37.378
TO SEE MY OWN WIFE.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.902
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY THINK
YOU'D HATE IT.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.948
WHY? IT'S A PARTY,
RIGHT?

26:41.948 --> 26:44.994
WELL, YEAH, BUT
NOT A PARTY PARTY.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.214
I MEAN, I'LL BE WORKING
THE WHOLE TIME,

26:47.214 --> 26:48.955
AND I'LL JUST FEEL BAD
THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.304
HUH.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.784
AND YOU'D HAVE
TO WEAR A TIE.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.786
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A TIE.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.788
BELIEVE ME, I THINK
YOU'D HAVE MORE FUN
AT THE CONCERT.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.093
WITHOUT YOU?

26:57.093 --> 27:00.227
HELLO! IT'S
THE FOO FIGHTERS.

27:00.227 --> 27:04.840
YEAH, PROBABLY.

27:04.840 --> 27:09.279
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING
REALLY FUN THIS WEEKEND.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.326
PROMISE, OK?

27:12.326 --> 27:13.893
I HAVE TO GO.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.331
THANKS FOR LUNCH.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.768
SO, I'M AT
THIS OFFICE PARTY,

27:19.768 --> 27:21.422
AND EVERYBODY'S
DRINKING.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.945
MY BOSS IS DRINKING.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.034
AND MY BOSS COMES
OVER TO ME AND SAYS,

27:25.034 --> 27:26.340
"HAVE A DRINK WITH ME."

27:26.340 --> 27:28.342
AND I SAY,
"NO, THANK YOU."

27:28.342 --> 27:32.172
AND HE SAYS,
"COME ON, LOOSEN UP.
WE'RE CELEBRATING."

27:32.172 --> 27:37.307
AND HE JUST KEEPS
PUSHING AND PUSHING
AND PUSHING.

27:37.307 --> 27:41.790
AND FINALLY I SAY,
"LISTEN, WILL YOU
JUST BACK OFF?

27:41.790 --> 27:44.706
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC."

27:47.927 --> 27:49.015
ARE YOU HURT?

27:49.015 --> 27:51.104
ONLY MY ANKLE.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.541
MAY I HAVE
YOUR PERMISSION
TO ASCERTAIN...

27:53.541 --> 27:55.021
YOU'RE STILL GOING OUT?

27:55.021 --> 27:59.025
I'M FEELING OK NOW.
KINDA...SO...YEAH.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.766
I REALLY LIKE HER,
CLAUD, AND I'M NOT
GOING TO BLOW THIS.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.550
IF I KEEP CANCELING
ON HER,

28:02.550 --> 28:04.378
SHE'S GOING
TO GET COMPLETELY
THE WRONG IDEA.

28:08.469 --> 28:09.731
I DON'T KNOW, CHARLIE.

28:09.731 --> 28:13.213
I'M OK.
I CAN DO THIS.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.780
I CAN'T DO THIS.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.783
I'M SORRY.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.133
HEY, I UNDERSTAND.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.874
IF YOU'RE SICK,
YOU'RE SICK.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.397
I'M SICK.

28:23.397 --> 28:26.095
I--I THOUGHT I WAS
FEELING BETTER,
I SWEAR.

28:26.095 --> 28:30.317
OK, UH, WELL,
TELL YOU WHAT.
THEN I'LL JUST GO.

28:30.317 --> 28:33.276
I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.

28:33.276 --> 28:36.671
HEY, REALLY, IT'S OK.
JUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.543
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.111
I KNOW. YOU SAID THAT.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.255
I BLEW IT.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.647
YOU BLEW IT.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.698
JULIA, WAIT UP.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

29:03.698 --> 29:06.005
YOU HAVE?
YEAH, LISTEN, I'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,

29:06.005 --> 29:08.137
AND THE TRUTH IS,
I AM RUNNING
OUT OF TIME HERE.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.530
SO, I DON'T NEED
TO SEE HOW YOU DO
AT THE GALA

29:09.530 --> 29:10.487
TO GIVE YOU THE JOB.

29:10.487 --> 29:11.924
LET'S JUST, UH,

29:11.924 --> 29:13.882
MAKE IT A
CELEBRATION INSTEAD.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.016
A CELEBRATION?

29:17.016 --> 29:19.192
I GAVE YOUR APPLICATION
TO PERSONNEL.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.236
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.151
I GOT THE--

29:22.151 --> 29:24.023
THAT IS SO AMAZING.
THANK YOU!

29:24.023 --> 29:27.026
I AM GOING TO WORK
SO HARD FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.

29:27.026 --> 29:28.897
YOU'RE WELCOME.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.118
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT--

29:32.118 --> 29:33.989
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

29:33.989 --> 29:35.730
YOU CAN'T JUST--

29:35.730 --> 29:37.123
WAIT A MINUTE, JULIA,
WHAT DID I DO?

29:37.123 --> 29:39.081
DANIEL,
I'M--I'M MARRIED.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.084
I'M--I'M MARRIED.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.651
MARRIED?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.522
YES! GOD, I'M MARRIED!

29:45.522 --> 29:49.091
OH, WOW. UH, YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER--

29:49.091 --> 29:50.527
WELL, YOU--YOU DON'T
ACT MARRIED.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.268
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:52.268 --> 29:53.966
YOU'RE NOT--
YOU DON'T WEAR
A WEDDING RING,

29:53.966 --> 29:55.358
SO HOW AM I--
YEAH, WELL, IT'S TOO BIG.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.884
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD JUST GO.

29:58.884 --> 29:59.928
I'M GOING TO GO.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.411
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

30:13.899 --> 30:15.814
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.254
[SIGHS]

30:23.909 --> 30:25.171
SO...

30:26.694 --> 30:28.087
IT WAS
AMAZING, HUH?

30:28.087 --> 30:30.829
YEAH, I CAN TELL USUALLY.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.657
IT'S FUNNY THAT
WE'VE NEVER--

30:33.657 --> 30:35.921
WELL, I--I USUALLY
GO NEAR WORK.

30:35.921 --> 30:36.965
AH.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.101
UH, YOU'RE...

30:42.101 --> 30:43.624
I'M WALKING.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.629
DO YOU WANT A RIDE?

30:51.153 --> 30:54.983
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE THIS ENERGY.

30:54.983 --> 31:00.206
THIS DRIVE OR WHATEVER
THAT USED TO MAKE ME
WANT TO DRINK.

31:00.206 --> 31:04.253
I GOTTA CHANNEL IT
INTO SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

31:04.253 --> 31:07.909
IT'S WEIRD. IT'S, LIKE,
I'M ADDICTED TO RECOVERY.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.519
YOU FEEL THAT, TOO?

31:11.652 --> 31:12.653
IT'S FUNNY.

31:12.653 --> 31:13.784
YEAH.

31:13.784 --> 31:17.092
SO, I GOT TO DO
GREAT IN SCHOOL.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.920
I GOT TO GET, LIKE,
A "B" AVERAGE,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.226
AND I HAVE
TO SUPPORT MYSELF,

31:20.226 --> 31:21.662
AND I HAVE TO HAVE
MY OWN PLACE,

31:21.662 --> 31:24.534
AND I NEED
TO DO IT ALL NOW.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.536
THAT'S ME
AND MY DAUGHTER.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.190
AFTER EVERYTHING
I PUT HER THROUGH,

31:28.190 --> 31:29.844
AFTER ALL
THOSE YEARS,

31:29.844 --> 31:31.977
I GOT
TO COME THROUGH.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.631
NO CHOICE. RIGHT?

31:34.631 --> 31:36.590
EVERYONE ELSE
BE DAMNED.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.721
I CANNOT LET HER
DOWN AGAIN.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.332
NO.

31:39.332 --> 31:43.205
I KNOW. IT'S THE SAME
THING WITH MY JOB--

31:43.205 --> 31:45.947
THIS MAINTENANCE THING.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.298
I GOT TO MAKE MONEY
SO I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF AND SARAH.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.914
SO WHAT IF
SOME PEOPLE'S PIPES
GET HURT ALONG THE WAY?

31:57.045 --> 31:58.003
ARE YOU MAKING AMENDS?

31:59.221 --> 32:02.181
HEY, I WILL IF YOU WILL.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.922
YOU'RE, LIKE,
WORSE THAN I AM.

32:06.054 --> 32:09.231
THAT'S BECAUSE
I AM JUST BARELY
HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.583
LIFE-WISE,
NOT DRINKING.

32:13.583 --> 32:18.110
GOD, IF I FEEL
LIKE I'M SLIPPING,

32:18.110 --> 32:20.242
OR WORSE, SOMEONE,
GOD FORBID,

32:20.242 --> 32:24.507
SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO SCREW IT UP
FOR ME AND NAT,

32:24.507 --> 32:25.813
I JUST...

32:27.380 --> 32:30.078
I GET THIS
MOTHER LION
THING GOING.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.821
FAIR OR UNFAIR,
WHO CARES?

32:33.821 --> 32:36.606
I KNOW. IT'S SELFISH.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.697
GETTING BETTER--
IT'S SELFISH.

32:40.697 --> 32:44.179
KIND OF HAS TO BE.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.790
NO ONE GETS THAT.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.795
NO ONE DOES.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.553
HEY.
HEY.

33:10.553 --> 33:13.687
SO? YOUR MEETING
RAN LONG.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.732

FROM MY MOM.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.170
OH, AND 11 CALLING
TO SAY, "HEY, THANKS
FOR THE FLUSH BALL."

33:19.736 --> 33:21.390
AND YOU KNOW
OUR FRIEND IN 14?

33:21.390 --> 33:22.870
YEAH.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.480
WELL, SHE'S GOT
TO BE OUT OF TOWN

33:24.480 --> 33:26.178
OR DEAD OR SOMETHING

33:26.178 --> 33:27.744
BECAUSE SHE HASN'T CALLED
TO BITCH ABOUT ANYTHING

33:27.744 --> 33:29.485
FOR 5 WHOLE HOURS.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.183
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

33:31.183 --> 33:33.054
COULDN'T WE JUST,

33:33.054 --> 33:35.535
I DON'T KNOW,
PUT CHEWING GUM
IN HER MAIL SLOT OR...

33:35.535 --> 33:37.145
SAY THAT WE DIDN'T
GET THE RENT CHECK

33:37.145 --> 33:38.973
AND WATCH
HER HEAD EXPLODE?

33:38.973 --> 33:40.192
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SARAH, DON'T. OK?

33:41.889 --> 33:44.718
LET'S JUST...

33:44.718 --> 33:46.024
LET'S GIVE HER
A BREAK.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.417
WHY?

33:48.417 --> 33:50.202
WHY? LIKE SHE
GAVE US A BREAK?

33:50.202 --> 33:51.986
WELL,
SHE WAS PROBABLY
A LITTLE OVERWHELMED

33:51.986 --> 33:53.509
WITH EVERYTHING
IN HER APARTMENT

33:53.509 --> 33:54.641
BREAKING
AT THE SAME TIME

33:54.641 --> 33:57.078
AND JUST KIND OF,

33:57.078 --> 34:00.212
I DON'T KNOW,
MISDIRECTED
HER ANGER.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.865
MISDIRECTED HER ANGER.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.347
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

34:05.347 --> 34:08.176
BAILEY, SHE'S BEEN
A TOTAL UNREASONABLE SHREW
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

34:08.176 --> 34:11.310
LOOK.
ALL I'M SAYING IS

34:11.310 --> 34:14.443
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
ELSE IS GOING ON
IN SOMEONE'S LIFE.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.141
WAIT A MINUTE,
BAILEY.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.926
WHERE IS ALL THIS
COMING FROM
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

34:18.926 --> 34:20.362
DID YOU TALK TO HER
OR SOMETHING?

34:22.669 --> 34:24.410
BAILEY, WHEN DID YOU
TALK TO HER?

34:24.410 --> 34:27.674
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
JUST TRUST ME ON THIS, OK?

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
SHE'S NOT A BAD PERSON.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.720
SHE'S NOT.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.644
GRIFFIN.

34:41.644 --> 34:42.819
HUH?

34:47.824 --> 34:48.825

34:48.825 --> 34:50.653
HUH? WHAT'S WRONG?

34:52.525 --> 34:54.440

34:57.399 --> 34:59.184

34:59.184 --> 35:02.622
WELL, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT
AND I JUST--

35:02.622 --> 35:04.014
YOU GOT TO COME WITH ME.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.235
NO.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.020
I GOT TO GO TO
THE FOO FIGHTERS.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.110

35:12.110 --> 35:16.070

35:19.987 --> 35:21.728
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GOING TO BE
ALL DRESSED UP.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.860
WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO LOOK LIKE IF I'M ALONE?

35:26.950 --> 35:31.129
YOU KNOW THE TICKETS
ARE EXPENSIVE.
I DON'T HAVE A TIE.

35:31.129 --> 35:35.002
YOU CAN SCALP THEM,
AND CHARLIE'S GOT TONS
OF TIES YOU CAN BORROW.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.529
OK. OK, I'LL GO.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.836
YOU'RE NUTS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

35:54.848 --> 35:56.937
COACH HAS GOT US
DOING WIND SPRINTS.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.373
THEY'RE THE WORST.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.202
YEAH.

36:01.202 --> 36:04.423

BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.262
WELL, WELL,

36:17.262 --> 36:19.002
IF YOU HADN'T
CARRIED ME
OFF THE FIELD

36:19.002 --> 36:21.701
TO THE NURSE'S
OFFICE,

36:21.701 --> 36:24.094
I COULD HAVE HAD
A STROKE OR...

36:24.094 --> 36:26.096
OR AN ANEURYSM
OR WHO KNOWS.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.012
YOU KNOW,
YOU OUGHT TO BAG IT.

36:29.012 --> 36:31.667

36:31.667 --> 36:33.234
I MEAN, YOU'RE
TOO LITTLE, SALINGER.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.585
YOU'RE TOO LITTLE
TO BE ON THE SIDELINES.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.936
I'M NOT--I'M NOT
THAT LITTLE.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.462
WE'RE PLAYING MADISON
IN A COUPLE WEEKS,

36:43.462 --> 36:46.900
AND THEIR ARMADILLO
IS A REAL NUT CASE.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.988
I MEAN,
HE COULD HURT YOU.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.859
AND, YEAH,

36:49.859 --> 36:52.949
IF I HAD TO WORRY ABOUT
YOU GETTING BANGED UP,

36:52.949 --> 36:55.038
I MIGHT NOT CONCENTRATE
ON MY GAME 100%.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.609
YOU'D WORRY ABOUT ME.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.264
WELL, YEAH. DUH.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.672
NO, I HAVEN'T READ IT.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.938
SOMETIMES CHOCOLATE
IS THE ONLY THING.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.113
YOU DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING?

37:26.113 --> 37:28.158
BUT THAT'S--

37:28.158 --> 37:30.248
I'VE BEEN FEELING
SICK AND IF THAT
WASN'T--

37:30.248 --> 37:33.163
NO, I MEAN,
I'M STILL
FEELING SICK AND--

37:33.163 --> 37:34.991
YOU'RE SURE?

37:34.991 --> 37:36.079

37:37.167 --> 37:38.778
OK.

37:38.778 --> 37:39.953
YEAH.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.741
THEY DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.265
EVERYTHING

37:48.570 --> 37:50.006
I'M NOT SICK.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.138
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.011

38:01.191 --> 38:04.064
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.545
IT'S LIKE MY STOMACH'S

38:06.545 --> 38:08.155
BUTTERFLIES.

38:08.155 --> 38:12.899

IT FEELS LIKE.
KIND OF...

38:12.899 --> 38:14.596
NERVOUS,

38:20.994 --> 38:22.387
ESPECIALLY--

38:22.387 --> 38:25.085
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU GET AROUND NINA.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.394
WELL, YEAH, IT IS
KIND OF LIKE--

38:29.394 --> 38:30.873
I MEAN, YOU SAW

A NOTICE FROM
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.127
THEY'RE DOING
SPOT INSPECTIONS

39:07.127 --> 39:08.476
UH-HUH.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.173
SO, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING

39:10.173 --> 39:12.524
THAT, UM, MAYBE
WE COULD GO UP
ON THE ROOF

39:12.524 --> 39:14.177
WITH SOME RAKES
AND GARBAGE BAGS.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.528
YOU KNOW, RADIO
AND SOME SUN SCREEN.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.964
KIND OF MAKE
AN AFTERNOON OF IT.

39:17.964 --> 39:21.359
OH. UH, I'M KIND
OF BUSY, ACTUALLY.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.360
DO YOU MIND
TAKING CARE OF IT?

39:24.492 --> 39:26.233
SOMEONE GOT
A LINOLEUM CRISIS?

39:26.233 --> 39:27.234
HUH?

39:27.234 --> 39:30.150
OH, NO, JUST I NOTICED

39:30.150 --> 39:32.065
ANNIE'S GOT SOME HOLES
IN HER KITCHEN FLOOR,

39:32.065 --> 39:35.024
SO I FIGURED I COULD FIND
A SCRAP THAT MATCHES.

39:35.024 --> 39:37.766
OK, UM, I GET IT.

39:37.766 --> 39:41.466
BAILEY, ABOUT ANNIE
AND WHAT CHANGED
YOUR MIND ABOUT HER.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.293
I MEAN, DUH.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.426
YOU KNOW,
YOU LEAVE HERE FOR
YOUR A.A. MEETING

39:45.426 --> 39:46.514
AND SHE'S THE TENANT
FROM HELL,

39:46.514 --> 39:48.342
BUT BY THE TIME
YOU GET BACK,

39:48.342 --> 39:49.778
YOU'VE COMPLETELY
CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT HER.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.128
SO, OBVIOUSLY,
SHE WAS THERE.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.609
RIGHT? THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING?

39:54.609 --> 39:56.611
HERE WE GO.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.874
YOU KNOW, BAILEY,
YOU CAN STILL BE A
RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC

39:58.874 --> 40:00.528
AND BE
A LOUSY PERSON.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.617
SHE'S NOT
A LOUSY PERSON, SARAH.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.011
SHE'S JUST HAD
A ROUGH TIME.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.752
YEAH, WELL,
SO HAVE YOU.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.275
SO HAVE YOU, SO WHY
ARE YOU WILLING
TO CUT HER SLACK

40:08.275 --> 40:10.495
WHEN SHE
WASN'T WILLING
TO CUT YOU ANY?

40:10.495 --> 40:12.888
MAYBE SHE WILL NOW.Answering machine:
LEAVE A MESSAGE--

40:12.888 --> 40:14.673

40:14.673 --> 40:17.458
Answering machine:

40:21.941 --> 40:23.899
I DON'T GET THAT,
BAILEY.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.901
WHY IS THAT
AN EXCUSE FOR WHAT
A BITCH SHE'S BEEN?

40:25.901 --> 40:29.296
WHY DOES THAT SUDDENLY
MOVE HER LINOLEUM
TO THE TOP OF THE LIST?

40:29.296 --> 40:31.820
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T GET
WHY HER BEING AN ALCOHOLIC
CHANGES ANYTHING.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.343
Answering machine:
ARE YOU NEVER

40:33.343 --> 40:34.693
GOING TO TALK TO YOUR
FATHER AND ME AGAIN?

40:34.693 --> 40:35.911
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING?

40:35.911 --> 40:38.131

YOU DON'T.

40:39.915 --> 40:42.614
Answering machine:

40:42.614 --> 40:46.182
I KEEP LEAVING MESSAGE

40:46.182 --> 40:48.533
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO CALL BACK,

40:48.533 --> 40:50.535
THEN I GUESS YOU'RE
SAYING THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR FROM US,

40:50.535 --> 40:55.104
SO IF THAT'S
WHAT'S YOU WANT,

40:55.104 --> 40:57.890
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.110
SO, THIS IS
YOUR JOB, HUH?

41:01.110 --> 41:03.112
STAND AROUND

41:03.112 --> 41:04.636

GOOD JOB,

41:04.636 --> 41:06.899
EVEN IF THEY DON'T
PAY YOU ANYTHING.

41:06.899 --> 41:09.554

I'M HERE.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.425

YOUR BOSS?

41:11.425 --> 41:13.122

I DON'T SEE HIM ANYWHERE.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.477
OH, BOY,

41:19.477 --> 41:21.043
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.044

41:45.067 --> 41:46.504
THIS IS
DANIEL MUSSER.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.897
THIS IS MY HUSBAND
GRIFFIN HOLBROOK.

41:48.897 --> 41:51.987
JULIA TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

41:51.987 --> 41:55.121
I KNOW SHE'S
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
THIS WHOLE BANAL THING--

41:55.121 --> 41:56.949
THIS, UH,
JOB YOU GOT HER.
YES.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.951
WELL, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO--

42:01.388 --> 42:03.042
DID I SAY
SOMETHING STUPID?

42:06.045 --> 42:09.048
NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.057
HI.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.758
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I EXPECTED TO SEE.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.238
DON'T SAY THAT.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.022
NO, REALLY, IT'S OK.

42:27.022 --> 42:29.155
I MEAN, UH,
I HAVE BEEN DUMPED

42:29.155 --> 42:31.374
IN SOME PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS
WAYS BEFORE,

42:31.374 --> 42:35.901
BUT THE, UH, THE FACT
THAT I MAKE YOU DIZZY
OR NAUSEOUS OR WHATEVER,

42:35.901 --> 42:38.207
WELL, THAT IS
A NEW ONE ON ME.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.470
WAIT A MINUTE, NINA,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

42:40.470 --> 42:41.950
I WASN'T
MAKING EXCUSES,

42:41.950 --> 42:44.213
I JUST REALLY
WASN'T FEELING WELL.

42:44.213 --> 42:48.391
AND I WANT
TO TRY THIS AGAIN.

42:50.132 --> 42:52.482
COME ON, WE HAVE
TO TRY THIS AGAIN.

42:57.357 --> 42:59.054
HERE.

42:59.054 --> 43:00.578
I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.102
CHICKEN LIVERS?

43:03.102 --> 43:04.712
WELL, YOU KNOW.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.631
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

43:10.631 --> 43:15.418
BETTER.
MUCH BETTER NOW.

43:15.418 --> 43:17.072
AND, UM...

43:18.857 --> 43:20.162
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GUESS WHAT I HAD.

43:21.337 --> 43:22.687
IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

43:25.124 --> 43:26.778
I HOPE SO.
