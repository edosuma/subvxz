00:35.727 --> 00:38.163
If I hit here, you'll get
all three cameras.

00:38.197 --> 00:39.198
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:39.231 --> 00:41.066
- Okay?
- Yeah. Great.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.534
- We're ready?
- Yeah.

00:43.635 --> 00:45.270
It's June 9th.

00:45.304 --> 00:48.307
We are in an undisclosed location.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.344
We are interrogating

00:52.377 --> 00:54.313
Jim Osterberg,

00:55.280 --> 00:57.182
about "The Stooges",

00:57.216 --> 00:59.851
the greatest rock and roll band ever.

01:02.554 --> 01:04.055
You know, uh, one of the things

01:04.089 --> 01:05.524
that amazes me, uh

01:05.557 --> 01:07.926
is that, um, they do not go about this

01:07.959 --> 01:10.529
in a show business way,
for instance, when somebody says

01:10.562 --> 01:12.864
"Here's an act,"
and they announce the act

01:12.897 --> 01:15.534
they may very well tune up
for ten or fifteen minutes

01:15.567 --> 01:17.436
before they ever play the first number

01:17.469 --> 01:18.770
that they're going to play.

01:18.803 --> 01:20.872
Uh, and the kids don't seem
to mind this at all.

01:20.905 --> 01:23.908
They, uh, they watch it all and,
uh, listen to the tune up

01:23.942 --> 01:25.577
and listen to them check the speakers.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.413
And I think we've got
some action coming up now.

01:28.447 --> 01:30.715
Uh, we'll leave Bob Waller
for the moment

01:30.749 --> 01:32.050
and go to the stage and listen

01:32.083 --> 01:33.452
to "Iggy and the Stooges!"

01:33.485 --> 01:36.221
* ...TV eye on me *

01:36.255 --> 01:39.391
* She got a TV eye *

01:39.424 --> 01:43.162
* Oh she had a TV eye on me *

01:43.195 --> 01:44.663
* No *

01:55.774 --> 01:57.108
* No! *

02:04.949 --> 02:07.319
There goes Iggy right into the crowd!

02:07.352 --> 02:10.455
- Down!
- We've lost audio on him.

02:10.489 --> 02:13.925
Bob Waller is down
in the field with the crowd.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.361
I don't know just where,
but we'll find him.

02:35.314 --> 02:38.149
Riots in the motor city!

02:42.354 --> 02:43.788
It was tough.

02:43.822 --> 02:45.490
And we were stumbling and bumbling

02:45.524 --> 02:48.059
and finally
the record company didn't even

02:48.092 --> 02:49.694
bother to have anything to do with us

02:49.728 --> 02:53.632
but we, we had agents
and different managers, uh

02:53.665 --> 02:56.801
who tried to see if they could penetrate

02:56.835 --> 02:59.904
the tangled web of our, of our career

02:59.938 --> 03:02.574
and most of them dropped out in horror.

03:02.607 --> 03:06.745
And we bumbled around America
playing raggedly.

03:06.778 --> 03:09.648
We started lookin',
uh, dirtier and dirtier

03:09.681 --> 03:11.983
and skinnier and skinnier

03:12.016 --> 03:13.652
and more and more used.

03:13.685 --> 03:15.554
And we were getting worse and worse.

03:15.587 --> 03:20.225
We're sinkin' fast
into semi-oblivious gigs.

03:20.259 --> 03:22.361
Some people still liked us.

03:22.394 --> 03:25.063
Some gigs I could
get it together to sing

03:25.096 --> 03:26.565
some I couldn't.

03:26.598 --> 03:29.668
Some gigs, I, we'd show up on time

03:29.701 --> 03:31.836
some we didn't.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.572
Up-upsetting people

03:33.605 --> 03:35.940
usually because of me, wherever we went.

03:42.281 --> 03:44.048
* Butt fuckers *

03:44.082 --> 03:45.584
* Cock suckers *

03:45.617 --> 03:48.019
* Wanna bang suck and run my world **

03:48.052 --> 03:50.522
The band was really deteriorating

03:50.555 --> 03:52.357
very rapidly at that point.

03:52.391 --> 03:54.559
So we went out
and played some gigs and stuff

03:54.593 --> 03:56.361
but all kinds of stuff happened.

03:56.395 --> 03:58.196
I mean, we had to play a job

03:58.229 --> 04:00.532
with Steve Mackay on drums.

04:00.565 --> 04:02.867
Which is really wild because, you know

04:02.901 --> 04:05.236
Steve said he could play drums,
but he couldn't.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.038
And s-so, so, we..

04:07.071 --> 04:08.873
We needed the money so bad

04:08.907 --> 04:10.375
we just let him play.

04:10.409 --> 04:12.544
Oh, you want me to tell that story?

04:12.577 --> 04:14.713
Iggy would call a song
and start doing it

04:14.746 --> 04:16.415
and I'd start doing a beat.

04:16.447 --> 04:17.916
And he'd come back and grab

04:17.949 --> 04:19.483
the sticks out of my hand

04:19.517 --> 04:21.052
and go over to the floor tom

04:21.084 --> 04:22.754
and he would beat the beat out.

04:22.787 --> 04:24.389
And then I would know what the beat was

04:24.423 --> 04:26.291
and then I'd finish the song.

04:26.325 --> 04:28.427
And he did that with every single song.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.061
And the crowd's throwing bottles at him

04:30.094 --> 04:31.663
and they're saying, "Come on, Iggy

04:31.696 --> 04:33.498
"let's see you puke, motherfucker!

04:33.532 --> 04:35.066
Ah, fuck you, fuck you."

04:35.099 --> 04:37.336
And, like, you know,
givin' him all the abuse.

04:37.369 --> 04:39.003
Thank you very much to the person

04:39.037 --> 04:41.573
who threw this glass bottle at my head.

04:41.606 --> 04:43.107
Nearly killed me, but you missed again

04:43.141 --> 04:45.844
so you have to keep trying next week.

04:47.278 --> 04:49.948
Leading up to the Michigan Palace job

04:49.981 --> 04:53.418
was, was, what I referred
to it as a death march.

04:53.452 --> 04:54.953
So they decided to book us

04:54.986 --> 04:58.289
in a little club outside of Detroit

04:58.323 --> 05:00.792
uh, called The Rock and Roll Farm.

05:00.825 --> 05:02.827
Turns out it's a biker bar.

05:02.861 --> 05:04.929
Here comes Iggy, out in the audience

05:04.963 --> 05:08.600
confronting people in-the,
uh-as only Iggy can do.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.469
And he comes up to one guy

05:10.502 --> 05:12.937
and the guy just hauls off

05:12.971 --> 05:15.106
and just cold-cocks him.

05:15.139 --> 05:16.274
Just, kaboom!

05:18.977 --> 05:20.311
I don't know how many of you

05:20.345 --> 05:23.382
saw us back in 1967

05:23.415 --> 05:24.783
when we first started, you know

05:24.816 --> 05:27.051
but it isn't too,
it isn't too easy being

05:27.085 --> 05:28.553
"The Stooges" sometimes, you know?

05:28.587 --> 05:29.954
Yeah!

05:29.988 --> 05:31.456
You know, after that gig

05:31.490 --> 05:32.891
nobody had to say anything.

05:32.924 --> 05:35.494
It was just, like, everybody had had it.

05:35.527 --> 05:37.028
I mean, we couldn't make a living.

05:37.061 --> 05:39.998
People were throwing shit at us
all the time

05:40.031 --> 05:42.467
and everybody was just tired of it.

05:42.501 --> 05:44.736
And so, so, uh..

05:44.769 --> 05:48.006
The-the brothers
moved back to Detroit.

05:48.039 --> 05:52.310
Jim never came to me and said it's over.

05:52.343 --> 05:54.078
I just figured it out myself.

05:54.112 --> 05:56.047
Well, here I am sleepin' on the floor

05:56.080 --> 05:59.484
I guess it's over.
I was basically homeless.

05:59.518 --> 06:01.252
I had a drum set.

06:01.285 --> 06:05.724
I sold it and bought
a one way ticket to Detroit.

06:07.526 --> 06:10.328
Ended up going over to mom's house

06:10.361 --> 06:12.564
and said, "Mom, I'm homeless

06:12.597 --> 06:15.266
I'm broke, I'm hungry."

06:15.299 --> 06:19.771
When the demise of
"The Stooges" occurred

06:19.804 --> 06:21.172
it wasn't really a surprise.

06:21.205 --> 06:24.342
And it goes back
to that full circle of, like

06:24.375 --> 06:27.211
go home, you know, to mom.

06:27.245 --> 06:28.847
After my brothers came home

06:28.880 --> 06:31.450
I remember feeling relieved

06:31.483 --> 06:33.084
and glad.

06:33.117 --> 06:35.687
It was like, phew. You know?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.956
They're safe.
That was the main thing.

06:37.989 --> 06:39.090
That they came home safe

06:39.123 --> 06:41.359
and they were still alive, you know?

06:41.392 --> 06:45.229
That's when I went home
to my parents' trailer.

06:45.263 --> 06:47.031
I was 24.

06:47.065 --> 06:49.400
And, um..

06:49.434 --> 06:52.971
The group had a... uh

06:53.004 --> 06:56.407
a-sp, a sort of
a sputtering demise.

07:03.748 --> 07:06.050
"Gimme Danger, Little Stranger."

07:21.866 --> 07:26.437
* Oh give me danger little stranger *

07:26.471 --> 07:30.408
* And I'll give you a piece *

07:30.441 --> 07:34.746
* Gimme danger little stranger *

07:34.779 --> 07:37.949
* And I'll feel your disease *

07:38.950 --> 07:42.787
* There's nothing in my dreams *

07:42.821 --> 07:47.458
* Just some ugly memories *

07:47.492 --> 07:51.496
* Kiss me like the ocean breeze *

07:51.530 --> 07:52.997
* Hey *

07:56.400 --> 07:57.869
* Oh *

08:15.587 --> 08:19.624
* Now if you will be my lover *

08:19.658 --> 08:23.161
* Well I will shiver insane *

08:37.174 --> 08:39.043
When I was about five

08:39.077 --> 08:42.647
we got a TV,
and I'd watch "Howdy Doody."

08:42.681 --> 08:44.983
Buffalo Bob was basically like

08:45.016 --> 08:48.720
uh, Timothy Leary for little kids on TV.

08:48.753 --> 08:50.321
How do you feel long about the middle

08:50.354 --> 08:51.856
of the morning, Clarabell?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.825
Not so good, little dragged down, huh?

08:53.858 --> 08:55.493
Well, then, Clarabell

08:55.526 --> 08:57.762
what you should have is Ovaltine!

08:57.796 --> 09:00.599
And I remember the sound of
the peanut gallery.

09:04.368 --> 09:06.370
Wa-a-ah!

09:06.404 --> 09:08.172
They had, uh, characters

09:08.206 --> 09:10.274
like Clarabell the Clown, you know

09:10.308 --> 09:12.343
and Clarabell the Clown
might do anything.

09:12.376 --> 09:14.512
You didn't know what he was gonna do

09:14.545 --> 09:16.681
and that just fascinated me.

09:16.715 --> 09:20.351
But the big-big one,
it was "Soupy Sales."

09:28.960 --> 09:31.229
It was called
"Lunchtime With Soupy."

09:31.262 --> 09:33.397
He encouraged kids to write to him

09:33.431 --> 09:35.967
but he said, "Always
when you write the letter

09:36.000 --> 09:40.404
please, twenty-five words or less."

09:40.438 --> 09:41.773
...where'd you learn
to sing like that?

09:41.806 --> 09:43.875
At my speech class.

09:43.908 --> 09:45.944
- At your sh.. At your...
- That's right, Bobby.

09:45.977 --> 09:47.211
At your spee..
Who is your teacher?

09:47.245 --> 09:49.113
And that always stuck with me.

09:49.147 --> 09:53.718
And when I wanted to start
writing songs for our group

09:53.752 --> 09:55.720
I thought, "This is the way to go

09:55.754 --> 09:57.488
"try to make it
twenty-five words

09:57.521 --> 09:59.090
different words or less."

09:59.123 --> 10:01.159
I didn't feel like I was Bob Dylan

10:01.192 --> 10:03.762
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah,
you know?

10:03.795 --> 10:06.898
And, uh, I thought
"Keep it really short,

10:06.931 --> 10:09.734
and none of it will be

10:09.768 --> 10:11.402
the wrong thing."

10:11.435 --> 10:13.304
* But no fun *

10:13.337 --> 10:15.139
* My babe *

10:15.173 --> 10:16.808
* No fun *

10:21.145 --> 10:25.349
Yeah, heh, I saw the movie
with my parents.

10:25.383 --> 10:29.353
And it felt great
that we had the same trailer.

10:29.387 --> 10:32.023
Inside, most of the lighting fixtures

10:32.056 --> 10:34.592
and part of the furnishings
were built-in.

10:34.625 --> 10:35.960
I had a little bedroom.

10:35.994 --> 10:39.931
It was maybe, four or five feet wide

10:39.964 --> 10:41.532
by about nine feet long.

10:41.565 --> 10:43.334
There's room for a little palette

10:43.367 --> 10:45.937
and a little mini desk.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.272
So, the only place
I could set up my drums

10:48.306 --> 10:49.440
was in the living room.

10:49.473 --> 10:51.442
All weekend long

10:51.475 --> 10:53.277
and every night after school

10:53.311 --> 10:56.781
my, my drum set took up
the entire living room.

10:56.815 --> 10:59.350
I had a lot of energy,
I'd beat for hours.

10:59.383 --> 11:00.685
Beat, bam, bam, bam, and I'm..

11:02.486 --> 11:03.654
The whole place is shakin'.

11:06.524 --> 11:08.827
They never complained

11:08.860 --> 11:11.029
but what they finally did do

11:11.062 --> 11:13.698
was after about a year of that

11:13.732 --> 11:16.167
they just gave me the master bedroom.

11:18.202 --> 11:20.138
At the time I thought,
"Wow, this is great!"

11:20.171 --> 11:22.841
but now I realize,
also it was probably a..

11:22.874 --> 11:26.711
Probably a comparable lesser
of two tortures.

11:26.745 --> 11:28.747
And they moved a..

11:28.780 --> 11:31.349
They-they moved
a standard sized bed

11:31.382 --> 11:33.017
into the small room.

11:33.051 --> 11:35.019
No desk,
just-just enough so they could

11:35.053 --> 11:36.855
get in and out of bed.

11:36.888 --> 11:39.690
And I had a...

11:39.724 --> 11:41.325
...single bed and my drum set

11:41.359 --> 11:44.095
set up all the time
in the master bedroom.

11:44.128 --> 11:45.930
I was so lucky...

11:47.198 --> 11:50.101
...to live at close quarters

11:50.134 --> 11:53.604
in a simple environment with my parents.

11:53.637 --> 11:55.840
I got to know my parents.

11:55.874 --> 11:57.408
Uh, that's a..

11:57.441 --> 11:58.943
That's a real treasure.

12:02.213 --> 12:06.117
I remember dumping my Tinker toys

12:06.150 --> 12:09.087
and my Lincoln Logs
when I was a little boy

12:09.120 --> 12:11.422
and pickin' up the wood bits.

12:11.455 --> 12:14.959
And I would make a drum out
of the cylinder and beat on it.

12:14.993 --> 12:16.627
And then, when I was in the fourth grade

12:16.660 --> 12:20.131
they took us to
the River Rouge assembly plant

12:20.164 --> 12:22.033
of the Ford Motor Company.

12:22.066 --> 12:24.368
And they had a machine that engineered

12:24.402 --> 12:26.570
a controlled drop of a piece of metal

12:26.604 --> 12:28.039
onto a stamping plate.

12:28.072 --> 12:30.141
And every time that thing hit
the stamping plate

12:30.174 --> 12:33.377
it made... this racket, this..

12:33.411 --> 12:36.314
A-a-a mega-clang.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.482
And, uh,
I-I liked the mega-clang.

12:50.494 --> 12:53.764
* I walk today *

12:53.798 --> 12:55.566
* Past some old time *

12:55.599 --> 12:58.269
I had a high school band, "The Iguanas."

12:58.302 --> 13:02.740
We got a job playin' full-time
at a teen club.

13:02.773 --> 13:05.243
A place called The Ponytail.

13:05.276 --> 13:07.946
I kept scheming, thinking of things

13:07.979 --> 13:11.916
to get more attention and,
uh, so I thought

13:11.950 --> 13:15.086
"What if I played
on the biggest drum riser

13:15.119 --> 13:17.221
that anybody has ever had?"

13:18.890 --> 13:20.624
I was about 16 feet up.

13:20.658 --> 13:23.461
All by myself, you know

13:23.494 --> 13:26.764
and the, and the band
is down there grumbling.

13:26.797 --> 13:29.600
A loser in the biz named Chuck

13:29.633 --> 13:30.768
approached me and he said

13:30.801 --> 13:32.971
"Well, I think you guys are pretty good

13:33.004 --> 13:34.338
"I'd like to be your manager

13:34.372 --> 13:36.474
and I'll help you
promote your own gigs."

13:36.507 --> 13:38.943
So we rented a pier for one night

13:38.977 --> 13:41.012
to throw our own concert.

13:41.045 --> 13:45.483
And we had a huge turnout,
a huge success.

13:49.053 --> 13:53.357
Until half-way through
the floor started to give.

13:55.159 --> 13:59.130
Nobody got hurt but basically,
we, we broke the pier.

14:00.498 --> 14:04.068
That was the end of the self promotion.

14:04.102 --> 14:06.537
I was "The Iguanas" during high school

14:06.570 --> 14:07.805
and straight out of high school

14:07.838 --> 14:09.807
then a semester in college.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.542
Then I dropped out of college

14:11.575 --> 14:13.811
and was looking out for
somebody to give me a job.

14:13.844 --> 14:17.581
And the "Prime Movers"
were these school dropout

14:17.615 --> 14:18.716
older guys.

14:18.749 --> 14:20.718
And they knew

14:20.751 --> 14:24.055
about all sorts of blues music.

14:24.088 --> 14:26.490
Butterfield's band came through town

14:26.524 --> 14:29.493
and the "Prime Movers"
tried to establish a connection

14:29.527 --> 14:32.830
to see if our group could get
some work through them.

14:32.863 --> 14:34.565
I asked, uh, Jerome Arnold

14:34.598 --> 14:36.434
the bass player
in Butterfield at the time

14:36.467 --> 14:38.436
if he had any tips for me and my playing

14:38.469 --> 14:42.440
and he said, "When you play,
you play it like you mean it."

14:43.874 --> 14:45.176
I was getting fairly good

14:45.209 --> 14:47.545
and, um, at some point I lost

14:47.578 --> 14:50.381
respect for or faith in the group.

14:50.414 --> 14:53.384
And I thought it wasn't really itself.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.353
So I decided to go where the real,

14:55.386 --> 14:58.589
real people were doing the real deal.

15:09.567 --> 15:12.736
Different.
Not like white America.

15:12.770 --> 15:16.975
I sat in with a couple of guys
and, uh, actually got paid

15:17.008 --> 15:21.479
ten bucks a couple of times
to do very unimportant gigs.

15:21.512 --> 15:23.647
Once with a guy named Johnny Young

15:23.681 --> 15:26.817
and once with Big Walter Horton

15:26.850 --> 15:30.388
when they had to go out
and play for white people.

15:30.421 --> 15:33.891
And, uh, and it was a thrill
for me and I learned a lot.

15:38.929 --> 15:40.498
It was more relaxed.

15:40.531 --> 15:42.600
They knew how to have a good time.

15:42.633 --> 15:47.238
And the music
was... very definite.

15:47.271 --> 15:50.408
I saw a little glimpse
of a deeper life of people

15:50.441 --> 15:53.577
who in their adulthood
had not lost their childhood.

16:00.351 --> 16:03.187
I smoked a big joint
one day by the river

16:03.221 --> 16:06.991
and realized that I was not black.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.793
I thought I would like to do

16:09.827 --> 16:12.997
for our generation

16:13.031 --> 16:14.465
what the good black players

16:14.498 --> 16:17.535
that I loved were doing for theirs.

16:21.705 --> 16:23.607
Eventually, I just got tired of looking

16:23.641 --> 16:25.509
at somebody's butt all the time.

16:27.145 --> 16:30.414
That's your-that's,
that's your curse.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.617
The best butt I ever played

16:33.651 --> 16:36.154
the two best butts I ever played behind

16:36.187 --> 16:39.190
were Abdul Fakir,
in "The Four Tops."

16:39.223 --> 16:41.959
He was the Four Top that would unify

16:41.992 --> 16:44.495
the other in their,
in their dance steps.

16:44.528 --> 16:47.031
He was, he was like
a ba-large bird.

16:47.065 --> 16:48.866
And the other one was Mary Weiss

16:48.899 --> 16:50.368
from "The Shangri-Las."

16:50.401 --> 16:52.503
Wonderful body and face.

16:52.536 --> 16:56.974
Delicious, creamy, female dream thing.

16:57.007 --> 17:01.045
* He don't hang around *

17:01.079 --> 17:02.813
* With the gang no more *

17:02.846 --> 17:05.683
I realized drumming
wasn't what I wanted to do

17:05.715 --> 17:08.419
so I decided to go back to Ann Arbor

17:08.452 --> 17:10.521
but I needed a ride home.

17:10.554 --> 17:12.156
So I called Ron

17:12.190 --> 17:14.592
and somehow Scott Richardson had a car

17:14.625 --> 17:17.728
and, uh, I did talk Ron
into working with me.

17:17.761 --> 17:20.731
* 'Cause I know that he did it for me *

17:20.763 --> 17:23.334
* Can't you see * And I can see *

17:23.367 --> 17:26.404
* It's still in the streets *

17:26.436 --> 17:32.042
* His heart is out in the street **

17:37.915 --> 17:40.551
Ron Asheton was a musician.

17:40.584 --> 17:43.954
He was one of the few people
that had longer hair than me.

17:43.987 --> 17:47.925
He was playing bass
occasionally with a band

17:47.958 --> 17:49.793
called "The Chosen Few"

17:49.827 --> 17:54.365
and I really like his style on bass.

17:54.398 --> 17:56.534
I met his brother, Scott, later

17:56.567 --> 17:59.403
when I was working at Discount Records.

17:59.437 --> 18:02.039
Across the street, there was a drugstore

18:02.072 --> 18:03.541
called Marshall's.

18:03.574 --> 18:06.277
And Scott and a couple of guys

18:06.310 --> 18:10.148
hung out inside this drugstore
doing nothing.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.150
One young tough and his friends.

18:12.183 --> 18:14.918
Now Scott looked like Elvis.

18:14.952 --> 18:17.488
Good-looking, athletic-looking

18:17.521 --> 18:20.591
indirect, uncommunicative kid.

18:20.624 --> 18:22.793
Scott left school after the ninth grade.

18:22.826 --> 18:26.164
I think he would put it
to somebody and that was that.

18:26.197 --> 18:28.732
He immediately began pestering me

18:28.766 --> 18:31.769
for about a year to teach him
something on the drums.

18:31.802 --> 18:34.472
I would ask you

18:34.505 --> 18:38.075
do you double stroke on your triplets?

18:38.108 --> 18:39.643
Mm-hmm.

18:39.677 --> 18:42.580
You know, I would think up
things to ask you...

18:42.613 --> 18:45.749
- Oh, I see.. Get it going.
- Just, just to talk to you.

18:45.783 --> 18:49.287
So I taught him, like,
four or five beats.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.457
Mostly, uh, Stax, Volt
and Bo Diddley stuff.

18:53.491 --> 18:55.693
My name is Scotty Asheton.
I go to Garfield School.

18:55.726 --> 18:57.628
I'm eight and a half years old.

18:57.661 --> 19:00.164
Hmm! My name is Ronny Asheton.

19:00.198 --> 19:03.434
I'm nine years old.
My.. I go to Garfield school.

19:03.467 --> 19:06.804
They lost their dad when,
uh, I-I think Ron was 14.

19:06.837 --> 19:10.107
And their father had been
a fighter pilot in the war

19:10.140 --> 19:13.444
and stayed in the military
shortly after the war

19:13.477 --> 19:15.279
was something we all had in common.

19:15.313 --> 19:17.448
...two, one, zero, dive!

19:19.082 --> 19:20.984
My dad was a World War II veteran.

19:21.018 --> 19:24.355
On his travels, he would buy
a little something

19:24.388 --> 19:26.224
like a dagger or a medal.

19:26.257 --> 19:27.991
And then I got interested in it.

19:28.025 --> 19:29.527
And we started collecting.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.562
And that was like a father and son..

19:31.595 --> 19:33.697
We found something to bond with.

19:33.731 --> 19:36.033
It had nothing to do with politics

19:36.066 --> 19:37.468
or what it stood for.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.737
That's pretty oddball that you're buying

19:39.770 --> 19:42.540
your eight year old son Nazi stuff.

19:44.242 --> 19:46.210
My name is Kathy Asheton.

19:46.244 --> 19:47.811
I go to Garfield School.

19:47.845 --> 19:49.813
I'm in second grade.

19:49.847 --> 19:51.415
That's all, folks.

19:51.449 --> 19:54.017
I-I was standing on our porch

19:54.051 --> 19:55.919
and noticed this guy walking

19:55.953 --> 19:58.822
into the neighborhood with long hair.

19:58.856 --> 20:01.592
And so I said to Scotty,
"Why don't you flag him down

20:01.625 --> 20:03.494
and see who he is," you know?

20:03.527 --> 20:05.996
And he whistled down Dave Alexander

20:06.029 --> 20:07.431
who it turned out to be.

20:07.465 --> 20:09.667
And so Scotty met him

20:09.700 --> 20:12.670
then Ronny ended up meeting with him.

20:12.703 --> 20:16.907
And they were the ones
that gravitated more together

20:16.940 --> 20:20.511
because of the, the commonality
of their interest

20:20.544 --> 20:22.280
in the British music.

20:23.614 --> 20:25.949
Ron cut his senior year in school.

20:25.983 --> 20:28.586
Dave sold his motorcycle
and flew to England

20:28.619 --> 20:30.688
and they saw "The Who" play.

20:30.721 --> 20:33.691
They went to the Marquee Club in London

20:33.724 --> 20:35.726
and they stayed
until that money ran out.

20:35.759 --> 20:38.562
And that's what really
set me on the path.

20:38.596 --> 20:42.366
Because when I came back,
I tried to go back to school

20:42.400 --> 20:44.935
and I just really didn't fit in.

20:44.968 --> 20:47.037
And Ann Arbor was still frat boys.

20:47.070 --> 20:48.739
There's not a lot of us.

20:48.772 --> 20:51.208
And my counselor even said,
"Well, why don't you just

20:51.241 --> 20:52.976
"take the rest of the year off

20:53.010 --> 20:55.379
and try to come back
next year?"

20:55.413 --> 20:56.747
And I'm going, "Yeah, okay."

20:56.780 --> 20:59.383
But then going back
next year, forget it.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.486
Next year you can plan
for higher success, Bill.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.389
Yes. Thanks, Miss Evans.

21:05.423 --> 21:07.791
Plan for higher success.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.429
Tape is rolling, any time you're ready.

21:11.462 --> 21:13.564
They had had the concept of a band

21:13.597 --> 21:14.998
called "The Dirty Shames"

21:15.032 --> 21:18.402
and that was basically
something they would tell people

21:18.436 --> 21:20.771
when they met people
at a party or something.

21:20.804 --> 21:23.774
"Yeah-yeah, we got a band, we're
called "The Dirty Shames.""

21:23.807 --> 21:25.743
There was a period when "The Stooges"

21:25.776 --> 21:27.244
resembled "The Dirty Shames."

21:27.277 --> 21:29.012
In that we, we decided

21:29.046 --> 21:32.750
we had a band,
we told people we had a band

21:32.783 --> 21:36.587
but we hadn't really done any playing.

21:36.620 --> 21:40.524
At one point, there was a trip
we made to New York

21:40.558 --> 21:44.762
and we met some attractive
girls... teenagers.

21:44.795 --> 21:48.466
Younger than us.
Who said they had a band.

21:48.499 --> 21:51.669
And we-we drove to Princeton,
New Jersey

21:51.702 --> 21:54.037
to see these girls play in a basement.

21:54.071 --> 21:57.708
And they were just...
lived with their parents.

21:57.741 --> 22:00.478
And they were very, very good.

22:00.511 --> 22:02.680
And they were much better than us.

22:02.713 --> 22:05.616
At that point we, we were shamed.

22:10.821 --> 22:13.223
We were gonna try a series of rehearsals

22:13.256 --> 22:15.292
at Ron and Scott's house.

22:15.325 --> 22:17.327
It was Ron who let me know

22:17.361 --> 22:20.964
"Look, I gotta feel good playing with..

22:20.998 --> 22:23.233
"It's-it's,
uh-it's a weed thing.

22:23.266 --> 22:24.835
That's when I'm in the mood."

22:24.868 --> 22:27.738
I found a guy who said he would sell me

22:27.771 --> 22:30.007
an entire marijuana plant.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.076
So he brought it to my parents trailer.

22:33.110 --> 22:36.647
He had this-he had this thing,
al-almost four feet of it.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.016
The roots still had dirt on 'em.

22:39.049 --> 22:41.419
I'd seen marijuana, it didn't look like

22:41.452 --> 22:43.086
anything I'd ever seen.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.723
"Are you sure this is.."
He said, "Yeah, yeah."

22:45.756 --> 22:47.357
He said,
"But you gotta cure it."

22:47.391 --> 22:51.028
There was a communal laundry
at the trailer park.

22:51.061 --> 22:53.664
I put a couple quarters in the dryer

22:53.697 --> 22:57.167
and started it up and sat there

22:57.200 --> 22:59.069
and it started to stink.

22:59.102 --> 23:03.841
"Oh, no!" I thought, I was
really scared, but nobody came.

23:03.874 --> 23:07.177
I went and buried
the whole bag of marijuana

23:07.210 --> 23:08.679
but when I wanted to rehearse

23:08.712 --> 23:13.183
I'd dig it up and,
uh, catch a 45-minute bus

23:13.216 --> 23:14.852
and it would be about noon.

23:14.885 --> 23:19.122
Usually I could get Ron up
anywhere from five minutes

23:19.156 --> 23:22.693
to a half-hour,
depending on what I had to do

23:22.726 --> 23:26.930
throw rocks, hose and, um, and with luck

23:26.964 --> 23:29.767
we'd actually all get down
in the basement

23:29.800 --> 23:31.735
2:30 at the earliest.

23:31.769 --> 23:33.704
But more often or not their mother

23:33.737 --> 23:35.806
would come home just after three.

23:35.839 --> 23:38.742
"I'm home, now shut up that racket!

23:38.776 --> 23:41.479
I want some peace,
and Osterberg's a mental!"

23:48.619 --> 23:52.089
I was in Ann Arbor,
I never saw those riots of '67

23:52.122 --> 23:54.892
but the way I thought,
must be abandoned houses

23:54.925 --> 23:57.427
all over Detroit where we
could live for free now.

23:57.461 --> 23:59.329
So I heard about one

23:59.362 --> 24:04.568
and I went to Detroit with a tab
of Mescaline and a shovel.

24:04.602 --> 24:07.505
And dropped the Mescaline
and went in that.

24:07.538 --> 24:09.840
I told Ron and Scott,
I'm gonna make a house.

24:09.873 --> 24:12.242
Prepare a house where we can live.

24:12.275 --> 24:13.410
What are your building?

24:13.443 --> 24:15.913
It's our house. Can't you tell?

24:15.946 --> 24:18.749
Yes, but you haven't finished it.

24:18.782 --> 24:22.019
I didn't know
from roofing and plumbing and..

24:22.052 --> 24:26.256
I didn't know from that shit,
you know? But I tired.

24:26.289 --> 24:28.125
This is where we hung out
for the first time

24:28.158 --> 24:31.595
and started being a group of people

24:31.629 --> 24:33.163
that were going to be a band.

24:33.196 --> 24:35.132
Any time day or night, you have an idea

24:35.165 --> 24:38.101
get together, talk about it,
play it out, work on songs.

24:38.135 --> 24:40.337
In one of our early houses

24:40.370 --> 24:42.439
where we never accomplished
making any music

24:42.472 --> 24:46.109
we had no discipline,
the cops kept shutting us down.

24:46.143 --> 24:48.345
We were real communists.

24:48.378 --> 24:51.181
We were not political at all

24:51.214 --> 24:54.785
but we were true communists.

24:54.818 --> 24:57.821
We lived in a communal house.

24:57.855 --> 25:01.358
We ate the same food at the same time.

25:01.391 --> 25:05.963
We practically shared
all the money pretty equally.

25:05.996 --> 25:09.967
When we began to write
songs... happily

25:10.000 --> 25:11.969
since we were too ignorant to realize

25:12.002 --> 25:14.204
that there was intellectual property.

25:14.237 --> 25:16.506
We shared authorship.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.750
Michigan was a key c-crossroads

25:26.784 --> 25:31.254
between San Francisco and New York.

25:31.288 --> 25:33.523
And it was where everybody
stopped on the way

25:33.557 --> 25:35.659
if they were gonna bother to stop at all

25:35.693 --> 25:37.695
in the flyover country.

25:37.728 --> 25:39.863
It was Ann Arbor.

25:55.879 --> 25:58.381
I had actually heard a little bit

25:58.415 --> 25:59.683
or read a little bit

25:59.717 --> 26:03.286
either by or about these people.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.456
I had everything, every sort
of record in the record store.

26:06.489 --> 26:09.292
I was the Stooge
who knew who John Cage was

26:09.326 --> 26:13.030
or knew Sun Ra, Carl Orff,
"The Ventures," Pharaoh Sanders

26:13.063 --> 26:16.266
Wailers, Duane Eddy, Link Wray,
"The Velvet Underground."

26:16.299 --> 26:19.202
"A Love Supreme" by John Coltrane.

26:19.236 --> 26:22.205
We role-played a lot,
and listened to a lot of music

26:22.239 --> 26:24.474
and one thing we would do
was get really stoned

26:24.507 --> 26:27.110
on either marijuana or LSD.

26:27.144 --> 26:31.048
Turn off all the lights
and we'd put on Harry Partch.

26:35.518 --> 26:36.720
All these sounds..

26:39.522 --> 26:42.425
Harry Partch was huge for me.

26:42.459 --> 26:44.728
You know, it was the idea that he hoboed

26:44.762 --> 26:48.732
he bohemed, he created
his own instruments.

26:48.766 --> 26:50.768
I like to think
of w-what I'm doing

26:50.801 --> 26:52.569
as visual and corporeal

26:52.602 --> 26:55.839
and, uh, I-I want
the instruments on stage

26:55.873 --> 26:57.574
and I want them to be beautiful.

26:57.607 --> 27:02.179
I also want the, the, uh, musicians

27:02.212 --> 27:05.282
to be a-an active part

27:05.315 --> 27:10.120
a, a very active part in the,
the whole production.

27:10.153 --> 27:12.422
I was making instruments

27:12.455 --> 27:15.859
while we played primitive riffs.

27:15.893 --> 27:18.628
We'd-we'd find
an extremely simple theme

27:18.662 --> 27:20.497
and play it over and over.

27:20.530 --> 27:23.433
Then take a rest, and play another one.

27:23.466 --> 27:27.037
Scott has in the basement
my old set of drums.

27:27.070 --> 27:30.373
And then he also had
the big thing was oil drums.

27:30.407 --> 27:33.977
He was beating on oil drums
with mallets.

27:35.879 --> 27:37.614
Ron had his bass and an amp.

27:37.647 --> 27:39.616
Just let a feeling come over you

27:39.649 --> 27:43.220
just kinda go with this
great sound that we're making.

27:43.253 --> 27:45.388
A-and sometimes something
would pop in my head

27:45.422 --> 27:47.190
sometimes, I, to get a sound

27:47.224 --> 27:49.960
I would just hammer on my guitar.

27:49.993 --> 27:52.062
They had this lap steel and just tuned

27:52.095 --> 27:55.065
every string beat
to the same note, to the E.

27:55.098 --> 27:58.101
Sounded like an airplane taking off.

28:01.171 --> 28:03.874
We had a blender around.

28:03.907 --> 28:06.176
And the Jim-O-Phone,
it was a cone.

28:06.209 --> 28:09.046
It had an opening about four inches

28:09.079 --> 28:12.082
or five inches across at the top.

28:12.115 --> 28:14.852
As soon as you drop the mic
into the opening, you'll get..

28:17.855 --> 28:19.857
You lower it a little bit
and it'll just go..

28:22.459 --> 28:25.262
And it even goes down octaves
until you get..

28:27.364 --> 28:30.667
Dave, he operated
some of these instruments.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.702
One of the first things
I used to love to do

28:32.736 --> 28:35.172
with a mic, I would inhale..

28:38.976 --> 28:42.112
And you listen
to "Asthma Attack."

28:45.715 --> 28:48.051
That's good free-form music.

29:01.564 --> 29:05.402
One night, we'd been up
all night on LSD.

29:05.435 --> 29:08.371
We were all in Ron's room
and I-I said

29:08.405 --> 29:10.407
"What about a name
for our band?"

29:10.440 --> 29:13.376
Ron just said, "Well, let's
just call it "The Stooges"

29:13.410 --> 29:15.078
"'cause we don't do anything wrong

29:15.112 --> 29:17.447
"but everybody's picking on us.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.951
But we'll be
"The Psychedelic Stooges.""

29:43.040 --> 29:46.076
Here's a bunch of guys
that couldn't even play.

29:46.109 --> 29:48.111
And they're playing the Grande Ballroom.

29:48.145 --> 29:50.747
And the audience is just mesmerized.

29:50.780 --> 29:55.085
You know, Iggy's in white face
playing his vacuum cleaner.

29:55.118 --> 29:56.786
I wore white face

29:56.820 --> 29:59.289
and I had an aluminum Afro wig.

29:59.322 --> 30:01.825
I was wearing a maternity smock

30:01.859 --> 30:03.660
and then events would happen.

30:03.693 --> 30:06.429
Like we would throw things
and make a noise.

30:06.463 --> 30:08.131
I would throw a pie.

30:08.165 --> 30:11.101
I actually tired to get the group...

30:11.134 --> 30:13.270
...to work out a cover song.

30:13.303 --> 30:16.606
What's simple enough
for the group to play

30:16.639 --> 30:20.377
simple enough for me to sing,
and has a good beat?

30:20.410 --> 30:23.280
And I-I-I,
this was a terrible experiment

30:23.313 --> 30:26.649
but we tried "She Cried"
by "Jay and the Americans."

30:31.654 --> 30:33.891
* And when I told her *

30:33.924 --> 30:36.626
* I didn't love her anymore *

30:36.659 --> 30:38.361
* She cried *

30:38.395 --> 30:40.230
That was as far as we could ever get.

30:40.263 --> 30:44.234
It sounded great.
I would, I'd do it right now.

30:44.267 --> 30:46.203
There was a particular rehearsal

30:46.236 --> 30:48.471
where I just handed
Ron a guitar and I just said

30:48.505 --> 30:51.841
"You do it, I'm not that good
at the music part."

30:51.875 --> 30:54.244
And Dave moved over on bass.

30:54.277 --> 30:56.213
Our manager came home

30:56.246 --> 30:59.816
and I improvised an angry song

30:59.849 --> 31:01.351
and began again.

31:01.384 --> 31:04.922
I-I had no way to express
my anger to this guy

31:04.955 --> 31:06.990
who I never liked so much.

31:07.024 --> 31:08.558
I just started jumping up and down

31:08.591 --> 31:12.029
like, kinda the way chimps or baboons do

31:12.062 --> 31:13.496
before they're gonna fight.

31:13.530 --> 31:16.099
Like that, and as soon
as I started doing that

31:16.133 --> 31:19.402
poof, up went the Asheton's.

31:19.436 --> 31:21.604
* All night *

31:21.638 --> 31:23.673
* Till I blow *

31:23.706 --> 31:26.543
* Away *

31:26.576 --> 31:28.845
* I feel alright *

31:28.878 --> 31:31.548
* I feel alright *

31:31.581 --> 31:35.953
That was the first time
I ever saw those two guys...

31:35.986 --> 31:38.788
...powerfully motivated by something

31:38.821 --> 31:42.125
that wasn't an imitation
of somebody else.

31:42.159 --> 31:43.994
Something that was their own.

31:45.228 --> 31:47.965
In the Asheton's I found primitive man.

31:47.998 --> 31:49.632
* So

31:54.437 --> 31:55.605
Wooh!

31:56.639 --> 31:58.108
* So *

32:04.081 --> 32:07.217
Brothers and sisters,
it's time to get down with it.

32:07.250 --> 32:10.620
Brothers, it's time to testify,
I want to know

32:10.653 --> 32:12.789
are you ready to testify?

32:12.822 --> 32:14.057
Are you ready?

32:14.091 --> 32:16.659
I give you a testimonial!

32:16.693 --> 32:18.628
The "MC5."

32:31.274 --> 32:34.511
* Hey love is like a Ramblin' Rose *

32:34.544 --> 32:37.347
Fred Smith was dating Kathy Asheton.

32:37.380 --> 32:40.350
Scott and I and Ron went with Kathy

32:40.383 --> 32:45.088
to see "MC5" when they were
still a cover band.

32:45.122 --> 32:47.690
Lot of attitude, they had the look down

32:47.724 --> 32:51.761
they were doing
British influenced R and B

32:51.794 --> 32:53.630
rock and soul.

32:56.233 --> 32:58.368
I remember a night when the three of us

32:58.401 --> 33:01.004
drove into Detroit
to see if we could talk

33:01.038 --> 33:02.805
about getting some opening slots.

33:02.839 --> 33:06.043
And they had a practice space
with a big thick door

33:06.076 --> 33:09.379
and Scott and Ron and I stood
there in the freezing cold

33:09.412 --> 33:11.448
listening through the door

33:11.481 --> 33:14.451
to "Kick Out The Jams"
coming through like..

33:20.390 --> 33:24.461
It was simple and then,
uh-wow, so powerful.

33:24.494 --> 33:26.996
We should get some of that.

33:30.567 --> 33:34.537
And we would play with them
for nothing in church basements

33:34.571 --> 33:38.641
youth centers, and we would
open some of their shows

33:38.675 --> 33:40.310
at the Ballroom.

33:40.343 --> 33:43.980
We joined their circus in many ways.

33:50.453 --> 33:54.557
The Five were bigger time
commies than we were.

33:54.591 --> 33:58.828
The big poohbah of the area
was John Sinclair.

33:58.861 --> 34:01.564
Total assault on the culture
by any means necessary

34:01.598 --> 34:04.501
including rock and roll, dope,
and fucking in the streets.

34:04.534 --> 34:08.737
We believe that the... general,
uh, social structure...

34:10.206 --> 34:12.842
...of the Western world is crumbling.

34:12.875 --> 34:17.614
And, uh, that, that now is
the time to increase

34:17.647 --> 34:22.219
the assault on this culture, and, uh..

34:22.252 --> 34:25.855
Under Sinclair's cloud of
mega-organization

34:25.888 --> 34:29.192
began to branch into, first,
there was the "MC5" commune

34:29.226 --> 34:32.529
and then there was
Trans-love Energies.

34:32.562 --> 34:35.364
And then they were
becoming more political

34:35.398 --> 34:37.367
and they wanted to be
like Black Panthers

34:37.400 --> 34:39.735
and they started this
W-White Panther party

34:39.768 --> 34:43.373
which was, which was honestly,
it was just ridiculous.

34:43.406 --> 34:45.141
We tried to avoid that.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.577
We tried to avoid everything.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.079
I guess that was why you,
you kept hearing

34:50.112 --> 34:51.714
the word "Nihilist" about us.

34:51.748 --> 34:55.918
But finally, at one point,
John put his foot down.

34:55.952 --> 34:59.055
And he wanted us to accompany
the Five to play

34:59.088 --> 35:00.890
at the democratic convention

35:00.923 --> 35:03.960
in Chicago in '68 that culminated

35:03.993 --> 35:06.629
in bloody rioting.

35:10.367 --> 35:14.504
* Well I'm sittin' all alone.. **

35:14.537 --> 35:16.273
And I didn't want to.

35:16.306 --> 35:20.177
There was a, you're either
with us or against us, moment

35:20.210 --> 35:23.580
there and I-I wasn't
going for it.

35:23.613 --> 35:25.282
I still didn't say anything.

35:25.315 --> 35:29.486
I started somersaulting around the room.

35:29.519 --> 35:31.988
That was my reaction.

35:32.021 --> 35:35.692
I-I couldn't think of any..
I don't know, I don't know.

35:35.725 --> 35:38.195
Oh, well, you know, I don't know why.

35:38.228 --> 35:41.097
But I just, I couldn't say no.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.600
And I wasn't gonna say yes.

35:43.633 --> 35:45.435
So finally he just left the room.

35:45.468 --> 35:47.003
I-I remember that moment.

35:47.036 --> 35:50.307
That wasn't who we were,
and that would have come out.

35:55.678 --> 35:57.947
Not long after that, we were playing in

35:57.980 --> 36:01.351
the student union in Michigan

36:01.384 --> 36:04.454
when a record scout
was coming to see them.

36:04.487 --> 36:06.856
He was, it was recommended
by Wayne Kramer

36:06.889 --> 36:09.992
"You should check out
our little brother band."

36:10.026 --> 36:12.495
This was Wayne Kramer,
I'll never forget this.

36:12.529 --> 36:16.533
He said, "You know, you'll like
us, but I think if you like us

36:16.566 --> 36:19.369
"there's, we have a little brother band

36:19.402 --> 36:21.971
you will really like them."

36:22.004 --> 36:26.643
Well, he was prescient in his..
I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, who?"

36:26.676 --> 36:28.745
It was "Iggy And The Stooges."

36:28.778 --> 36:30.647
They were, I said,
"Well, when can I see them?"

36:30.680 --> 36:32.549
He said, "They're playing
this afternoon.

36:32.582 --> 36:34.751
On the campus
at the University of Michigan."

36:34.784 --> 36:37.520
I went across the street,
and up the stairs

36:37.554 --> 36:40.390
and heard this incredible music

36:40.423 --> 36:42.492
just booming in the hallways.

36:42.525 --> 36:44.694
I said, "Ah, this is so great."

36:44.727 --> 36:47.997
And I was, I was pulled by the music.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.600
People ask me,
"When did you first see Iggy?"

36:50.633 --> 36:54.170
But I didn't.
I heard them before I saw them.

37:06.749 --> 37:09.519
Then I saw Iggy, he was the front man.

37:09.552 --> 37:12.289
I thought,
"This is just perfection."

37:13.390 --> 37:15.292
We used to get those big amps crankin

37:15.325 --> 37:17.360
and this room just rang.

37:17.394 --> 37:19.362
It was like
the-the sound just bounced

37:19.396 --> 37:20.630
you can hear it from this.

37:20.663 --> 37:23.633
Just imagine Marshall stacks at ten.

37:23.666 --> 37:27.370
This is, uh, where we were
discovered by Danny Fields.

37:27.404 --> 37:29.906
We got done playing,
this is the same stage.

37:29.939 --> 37:32.542
Place was packed,
you know, imagine the late

37:32.575 --> 37:35.712
this was late sixties.
Like 1968.

37:35.745 --> 37:38.381
He was a PR for Elektra Records.

37:38.415 --> 37:41.418
So we get off stage and he goes, uh

37:41.451 --> 37:43.486
"How would you guys
like to be, uh, stars?"

37:43.520 --> 37:44.921
"Oh, yeah. Right, sure.

37:44.954 --> 37:46.956
Throw this guy out."
And he was serious.

37:46.989 --> 37:48.425
I'm just gonna call the president

37:48.458 --> 37:49.992
of Elektra Records, and I said

37:50.026 --> 37:51.728
"I just saw two great bands.

37:51.761 --> 37:54.564
"The one band
is really popular around here

37:54.597 --> 37:55.932
"they have a following

37:55.965 --> 37:58.234
"they play to two,
three thousand people.

37:58.267 --> 38:02.071
And the other band is a little
early stages of development."

38:02.104 --> 38:06.409
Jac just said, "See if the big
band will take twenty thousand

38:06.443 --> 38:07.810
and the little band
will take five."

38:07.844 --> 38:09.512
Both bands signed on that day

38:09.546 --> 38:14.250
it was the weekend
of September 22nd, 1968.

38:14.283 --> 38:18.355
Show biz is not a friendly place

38:18.388 --> 38:21.157
and I gotta say, of all the people

38:21.190 --> 38:24.761
that ever extended a hand to our group

38:24.794 --> 38:28.798
the "MC5" were probably
the most genuine about it.

38:28.831 --> 38:31.334
As soon as we got signed,
we started feeling

38:31.368 --> 38:33.336
more professional.

38:33.370 --> 38:35.972
I think we realized we didn't need to be

38:36.005 --> 38:38.107
"The Psychedelic Stooges."

38:38.140 --> 38:39.476
We'll just be "The Stooges."

38:39.509 --> 38:42.445
So Ron actually called up Moe Howard

38:42.479 --> 38:44.847
to see if it would be okay.

39:11.340 --> 39:16.012
That was Ron's finest hour,
when he came up over

39:16.045 --> 39:19.849
the next months with two great riffs.

39:19.882 --> 39:22.685
Uh, "Wanna Be Your Dog,"
and "No Fun."

39:22.719 --> 39:24.654
So for a while we just went out
and played it

39:24.687 --> 39:27.323
and-and I remember
on both that one

39:27.356 --> 39:31.160
and "No Fun," the members of
the "MC5" raising an eyebrow

39:31.193 --> 39:34.497
and going, "Uh, you got
a good riff there."

39:59.489 --> 40:01.123
We-we loved it. We loved it.

40:01.157 --> 40:04.193
Every, all, the whole group
loved New York.

40:04.226 --> 40:06.395
There were things in that environment

40:06.429 --> 40:10.967
that didn't really exist for
a young person in the Midwest.

40:13.803 --> 40:18.007
* In my room I want you here **

40:21.844 --> 40:24.313
I'd been listening
to one of Velvet's records.

40:24.346 --> 40:26.549
It's just very, very good.

40:26.583 --> 40:28.718
An-and it was simple.

40:28.751 --> 40:31.253
And the simplicity,
and some of the droning

40:31.287 --> 40:32.989
and some of the moods

40:33.022 --> 40:36.493
had a big influence on us, you know?

40:41.097 --> 40:44.166
So when they suggested
John Cale, we thought

40:44.200 --> 40:46.469
it was perfect for us.

40:46.503 --> 40:49.972
That record... wouldn't
have felt the same

40:50.006 --> 40:52.675
if we hadn't brought it to New York

40:52.709 --> 40:55.177
and played it for that person.

40:55.211 --> 40:57.079
We preformed for him.

40:57.113 --> 40:58.648
I-I remember that he

40:58.681 --> 41:00.617
wore a big black cape

41:00.650 --> 41:03.853
like Z-Man in "Beyond
the Valley of the Dolls."

41:05.154 --> 41:07.123
He brought Nico in a few times.

41:07.156 --> 41:11.861
It really looked like,
uh, Morticia and Gomez.

41:11.894 --> 41:12.762
Ready.

41:12.795 --> 41:15.665
When we recorded the record.

41:15.698 --> 41:17.967
They couldn't get a decent band track

41:18.000 --> 41:21.671
of the band unless I danced.

41:26.175 --> 41:29.546
I would stand in the band room with them

41:29.579 --> 41:31.180
just with no mic or anything

41:31.213 --> 41:33.349
and just dance and jump around

41:33.382 --> 41:34.884
and roll around.

41:34.917 --> 41:37.486
Do whatever I had to do to get a take.

41:42.158 --> 41:45.962
The studio was, was a tiny little room

41:45.995 --> 41:48.197
above a peep show on Times Square

41:48.230 --> 41:51.634
but it was an R and B studio
run by Jerry Ragovoy

41:51.668 --> 41:53.803
with tiny little amplifiers.

41:53.836 --> 41:56.305
And then we came in
with our Marshall stacks

41:56.338 --> 41:58.307
and everybody freaked out.

41:59.876 --> 42:02.044
The host engineer started saying

42:02.078 --> 42:04.013
"But Jerry Ragovoy
does it this way."

42:04.046 --> 42:07.049
"I don't care about Jerry Ragovoy.

42:07.083 --> 42:09.318
You know,
you don't understand."

42:13.022 --> 42:16.425
Cale finally got us
to turn our amps to nine.

42:16.458 --> 42:17.894
That was the compromise.

42:17.927 --> 42:22.699
* You took my arm *

42:22.732 --> 42:25.267
* And you broke my.. *

42:25.301 --> 42:26.869
We had four songs.

42:26.903 --> 42:31.273
"Dog." "Fun." "69." and "Ann."

42:31.307 --> 42:35.678
And the idea was,
each song had a song part

42:35.712 --> 42:37.413
that lasted about two minutes.

42:37.446 --> 42:41.851
And then there'd be about ten
minutes of improv on the riff.

42:41.884 --> 42:44.854
When we heard it back taped, I thought

42:44.887 --> 42:47.389
these songs are great,
for the first three minutes

42:47.423 --> 42:48.925
this is good.

42:48.958 --> 42:52.528
And then after the three
minutes, I started thinking

42:52.561 --> 42:54.764
I don't know if this is really

42:54.797 --> 42:57.366
so great to listen to
at minute seven here.

42:57.399 --> 42:59.201
But I didn't say anything.

42:59.235 --> 43:03.039
And-and then it took
the very sensible

43:03.072 --> 43:06.175
record store owner
in business, Jac Holzman.

43:07.009 --> 43:08.277
No, no, no, no.

43:08.310 --> 43:09.545
He said, "I can't put this out.

43:09.578 --> 43:11.580
There's not enough songs."

43:11.614 --> 43:13.916
And you know,
I-I knew he was right.

43:15.351 --> 43:18.387
Oh, we got a lot more songs,
just, uh, give

43:18.420 --> 43:19.588
book us another session.

43:21.423 --> 43:24.393
* She *

43:24.426 --> 43:26.562
* Not right *

43:26.595 --> 43:28.064
* I want something *

43:28.097 --> 43:30.833
* I want something tonight *

43:30.867 --> 43:33.670
Half or more of the songs

43:33.703 --> 43:37.239
were written in the Chelsea Hotel.

43:37.273 --> 43:40.910
The day before we went into the studio

43:40.943 --> 43:44.781
and the song, "Not Right,"

43:44.814 --> 43:46.849
we had never played.

43:46.883 --> 43:50.987
The first time we'd ever played it

43:51.020 --> 43:53.790
that was it, that was the take.

43:57.393 --> 44:00.830
* It's always *

44:00.863 --> 44:03.032
* Well it's always this way *

44:11.808 --> 44:16.312
Shree Ram..

44:24.253 --> 44:25.988
Dave Alexander,

44:27.824 --> 44:29.291
he said...

44:29.325 --> 44:32.194
..."Why don't we do something
with an Om chant?"

44:39.235 --> 44:42.138
I don't know if it was Ron
or me, but one of us

44:42.171 --> 44:44.741
melodicized the chant and then made it..

44:44.774 --> 44:46.709
Om...

44:46.743 --> 44:51.180
...Shree Ram...

44:51.213 --> 44:52.681
...Ja.

44:54.050 --> 44:58.054
Ram, ja, ja, Ram..

45:00.689 --> 45:02.925
* Tonight.. *

45:02.959 --> 45:05.327
If we didn't have that
song on that album

45:05.361 --> 45:08.430
we-we would have had
just a bunch of similar

45:08.464 --> 45:11.100
rock tracks in the party line.

45:11.133 --> 45:16.372
Ram, cha, cha, Ram..

45:16.405 --> 45:21.010
* I hold myself tight *

45:21.043 --> 45:23.946
Shree Ram..

45:23.980 --> 45:26.783
It did make a statement that

45:26.816 --> 45:29.886
we weren't like the other bands.

45:29.919 --> 45:33.422
...cha, cha, Ram.

45:34.957 --> 45:37.193
* I won't fight *

45:37.226 --> 45:39.728
Dave changed our history.

45:43.732 --> 45:46.268
* I won't fight *

45:46.302 --> 45:50.072
Ram, cha, cha..

45:50.106 --> 45:52.875
That record, I thought it was a..

45:52.909 --> 45:55.144
...myself that it was a...

45:55.177 --> 45:59.448
...sort of neat, petite, well-organized

45:59.481 --> 46:03.719
good, sharp, little poke, and, uh..

46:03.752 --> 46:05.888
I was, I was real proud of the, uh

46:05.922 --> 46:08.657
the clarity of the songs.

46:08.690 --> 46:15.297
* Midnight winds are landing
at the end of time *

46:16.999 --> 46:21.303
Nico's the most culturally
and artistically knowledgeable

46:21.337 --> 46:23.906
beautiful woman that I'd ever met.

46:23.940 --> 46:25.441
She's ten years older than me

46:25.474 --> 46:28.110
and she had an opinion about
almost everything

46:28.144 --> 46:31.347
that had to do with the arts,
and I listened to her.

46:31.380 --> 46:35.151
Now I began being influenced,
probably got a little crazier.

46:35.184 --> 46:38.087
She stayed a couple of weeks, I think.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.757
They hated having a girl in the house.

46:41.790 --> 46:44.626
And at first we resented
her being there.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.428
It's like.. Dammit!

46:46.462 --> 46:48.764
And they pretty much kept to themselves

46:48.797 --> 46:50.432
so there's no hanging out...

46:50.466 --> 46:52.869
...and then the worst was, uh...

46:52.902 --> 46:54.370
...bringing her in the practice room.

46:54.403 --> 46:57.106
No women or girlfriends
in the practice room.

46:57.139 --> 46:58.674
She'd sit there..

46:58.707 --> 47:01.810
...watch, and she'd critique it,
you know.

47:01.844 --> 47:03.012
"This one is very good."

47:03.045 --> 47:04.613
I-I think
she was on the rebound

47:04.646 --> 47:07.316
maybe from something
with Lou Reed, perhaps

47:07.349 --> 47:10.152
so she'd, she'd usually
get in a dig at Lou

47:10.186 --> 47:13.189
whenever she liked something
I was doing, she'd say

47:13.222 --> 47:14.790
"You, you are much better

47:14.823 --> 47:17.293
you are much more talented
than Lou."

47:17.326 --> 47:19.962
So we just started hanging out and, uh

47:19.996 --> 47:21.898
gave her a break because she was

47:21.931 --> 47:23.632
an interesting, good person.

47:29.605 --> 47:31.707
And we went and played that material

47:31.740 --> 47:34.343
at the World's Fair Pavilion...

47:34.376 --> 47:37.313
...in Queens, near where
the Ramones grew up...

47:37.346 --> 47:39.882
...as, as an opening act to Joe Cocker.

47:39.916 --> 47:42.251
Well, you know,
Joe Cocker's singing, uh..

47:42.284 --> 47:46.522
* You are so beautiful.. *

47:46.555 --> 47:48.257
And everybody's...

47:48.290 --> 47:52.828
...going nuts. You know,
this is it, and then we're like..

47:58.800 --> 48:00.669
And just..

48:03.205 --> 48:05.407
In the 50's...

48:05.441 --> 48:08.710
...they figured out how to suck
the life out of rock and roll

48:08.744 --> 48:12.081
on the one hand they replace
Elvis with Fabian

48:12.114 --> 48:14.183
and then also at the same time

48:14.216 --> 48:16.718
we'll run out Perry Como on 'em.

48:16.752 --> 48:19.688
This was happening again.

48:19.721 --> 48:22.424
Rock and roll at the time
was being co-opted

48:22.458 --> 48:27.229
by a political-industrial
complex of corrupt performers

48:27.263 --> 48:31.533
and evil manager-owners,
who were going to create

48:31.567 --> 48:35.271
whatever they thought
was the best product for them.

48:35.304 --> 48:37.273
Whether you want it or not

48:37.306 --> 48:39.808
we're gonna shove this down
your little throats.

48:39.841 --> 48:44.313
They rejected their own
country and their own people.

48:44.346 --> 48:46.582
It's a, it's cultural treason.

48:48.417 --> 48:51.220
There was more "American Idol."

48:51.253 --> 48:54.656
More of the corny talent show

48:54.690 --> 48:58.227
suggested to the American
audience at that time than, uh

48:58.260 --> 48:59.761
than people like to admit.

48:59.795 --> 49:02.464
It was all, you know..

49:04.633 --> 49:07.236
* Marrakesh Express *

49:07.269 --> 49:09.071
* Wouldn't you know we're riding *

49:09.105 --> 49:12.308
* On the Marrakesh Express.. *

49:12.341 --> 49:14.610
I mean, somebody needs to say, you know

49:14.643 --> 49:18.280
some of the biggest
peace-love acts

49:18.314 --> 49:20.649
of the California, uh

49:20.682 --> 49:24.120
five years of love, umm...

49:24.153 --> 49:28.957
...were created in m-meetings.

49:30.059 --> 49:33.029
And stuff... smells.

49:34.663 --> 49:36.665
I say it s-still smells.

50:12.834 --> 50:14.203
We crossed the Mississippi

50:14.236 --> 50:17.139
for the first time in, uh, 1970

50:17.173 --> 50:18.807
to record Fun House and

50:18.840 --> 50:20.476
every day, around noon

50:20.509 --> 50:25.081
we would all go into the studio
and, uh, record for the day.

50:25.114 --> 50:27.049
Each day was always, it was

50:27.083 --> 50:29.818
this is the day of loose

50:29.851 --> 50:31.987
and that's all we
were gonna do that day.

50:32.020 --> 50:33.489
And there was the day of

50:33.522 --> 50:35.391
down on the street,
et cetera, et cetera.

50:35.424 --> 50:37.659
And then a couple of days mixing.

50:37.693 --> 50:39.728
It was under two weeks.

50:39.761 --> 50:42.498
We were experimenting
after "The Stooges"

50:42.531 --> 50:46.602
with more aggressive music,
with more space

50:46.635 --> 50:50.539
a la Bitches Brew by Miles Davis

50:50.572 --> 50:52.541
we hoped...

50:52.574 --> 50:55.111
...and everything that
James Brown was doing

50:55.144 --> 50:57.746
with Fred Wesley and Maceo Parker.

50:57.779 --> 51:02.351
And I saw Steve playing with
his band "The Carnal Kitchen."

51:02.384 --> 51:05.887
Oh, my God, this guy
can really blow a horn.

51:05.921 --> 51:09.091
He had "1970" and "Fun House"
already written

51:09.125 --> 51:10.526
just waiting for me.

51:10.559 --> 51:14.563
And we got to "Fun House" and he said

51:14.596 --> 51:16.965
"Play like Maceo Parker
on acid."

51:22.838 --> 51:25.774
And we did some interesting
things with space.

51:25.807 --> 51:30.112
Things like, uh, very minimal...

51:30.146 --> 51:31.747
...drum, uh

51:31.780 --> 51:33.649
four-four drum beats

51:33.682 --> 51:37.119
but with, uh, syncopations on the top.

51:45.961 --> 51:48.797
And double tracking leads sometimes

51:48.830 --> 51:50.299
but with no rhythm guitar.

51:50.332 --> 51:52.634
That's not usually done in rock and roll

51:52.668 --> 51:55.771
it's not very.. It's supposed
to be very commercial.

52:04.780 --> 52:08.350
Elektra studio was just marvelous.

52:08.384 --> 52:11.787
It was just one room,
there were no choices.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.789
It was intimate, but big enough

52:13.822 --> 52:15.924
that you could
spread things a little bit.

52:15.957 --> 52:18.260
It had a, it had a nice throw rug.

52:18.294 --> 52:21.463
I was using my own PA stack in there.

52:21.497 --> 52:24.700
I didn't want
the studio-made sound

52:24.733 --> 52:26.935
that the vocals had on the first album.

52:26.968 --> 52:29.505
- Would you like a music stand?
- Say what?

52:29.538 --> 52:31.973
- Would you like a music stand?
- No, that's okay.

52:32.007 --> 52:33.542
Ron says he needs the bass up again.

52:33.575 --> 52:35.211
He-he turned it up.

52:35.244 --> 52:37.879
We got the red lights,
anytime you're ready.

52:40.582 --> 52:43.885
We were housed in the Tropicana Motel.

52:43.919 --> 52:48.023
And Warhol had the d-door
to his room ajar one day

52:48.056 --> 52:49.791
I went in to say hi.

52:49.825 --> 52:53.161
He suggested, he said,
"Why don't you do some songs..

52:53.195 --> 52:56.332
"Just sing the newspaper.

52:56.365 --> 52:59.668
Just sing what it says
in the newspaper."

52:59.701 --> 53:02.137
I haven't gotten around to it yet but

53:02.170 --> 53:04.540
that was his, that was his idea.

53:04.573 --> 53:07.543
While we stayed there,
the suite next to mine

53:07.576 --> 53:10.145
it was occupied by Ed Sanders

53:10.178 --> 53:12.981
who was writing "The Family."

53:13.014 --> 53:17.586
I was, int.. Always interested
in new looks, too.

53:17.619 --> 53:19.521
There was a pet store catered to dogs

53:19.555 --> 53:21.490
called The Bowser Boutique

53:21.523 --> 53:24.326
down the street on Santa Monica
and I walked by one day...

53:24.360 --> 53:27.763
And I saw this
red dog collar and I thought..

53:27.796 --> 53:31.533
"I would look so cool if
I had that dog collar," right?

53:31.567 --> 53:33.001
So I bought the dog collar

53:33.034 --> 53:35.271
and I started wearing it every day

53:35.304 --> 53:37.339
to go to the studio,
and Ed Sanders would

53:37.373 --> 53:39.074
look at me and he'd say..

53:39.107 --> 53:41.343
"You don't know
what that means, do you?"

53:41.377 --> 53:44.680
You know, I still, I-I still
don't know what it means!

53:44.713 --> 53:46.915
- You know, but he was like..
- It was cool.

53:46.948 --> 53:48.717
One day, I was out for a walk

53:48.750 --> 53:51.019
and I was walking
in the opposite direction

53:51.052 --> 53:52.521
from the Tropicana.

53:52.554 --> 53:54.523
It was on, uh, Santa Monica

53:54.556 --> 53:56.692
I think it was the corner of Westmont

53:56.725 --> 54:01.697
and a black caddy came tearing
assin' down, down the hill..

54:01.730 --> 54:03.299
He had to slam on the brakes

54:03.332 --> 54:06.201
because I was
stepping off the curb. I..

54:06.234 --> 54:10.238
He looked at me and he says,
I was sure it was John Wayne.

54:10.272 --> 54:12.441
"Goddamn it!"

54:12.474 --> 54:14.910
I haven't lost my temper in 40 years

54:14.943 --> 54:17.379
but, Pilgrim, you caused
a lot of trouble this morning

54:17.413 --> 54:18.780
mighta got somebody killed.

54:18.814 --> 54:20.215
And then he swerved

54:20.248 --> 54:22.083
he swerved around me

54:22.117 --> 54:24.152
and sped off in the

54:24.185 --> 54:27.289
general direction of Dan Tana's.

54:27.323 --> 54:30.091
And here's the world-famous
Whisky A Go-Go on the strip.

54:30.125 --> 54:32.461
A favorite dancing spot
for both the mods and

54:32.494 --> 54:34.630
movie stars who want to get it on.

54:34.663 --> 54:36.465
Let's drop in and see
what's happening tonight.

54:40.101 --> 54:42.804
It was really a California experience

54:42.838 --> 54:46.308
and then to pay for it,
we were bidden to do two

54:46.342 --> 54:48.410
two nights at the Whiskey.

54:48.444 --> 54:50.145
And the Whiskey a Go-Go in LA

54:50.178 --> 54:53.114
and two nights in San Francisco
at the Fillmore.

54:53.148 --> 54:55.351
Which freaked everybody out.

54:55.384 --> 54:57.252
Every time, every place we played...

54:57.285 --> 54:59.087
Nobody had ever seen anything like

54:59.120 --> 55:01.457
what we did, you know..

55:01.490 --> 55:06.728
* I took a record of pretty music *

55:08.864 --> 55:13.268
* Now I'm putting it to you
straight from hell *

55:13.301 --> 55:14.870
Upon our return to the Midwest

55:14.903 --> 55:18.607
we were playing larger festivals...

55:18.640 --> 55:20.942
...larger events and we were getting

55:20.976 --> 55:26.114
pretty good life
because the stuff on Fun House

55:26.147 --> 55:29.851
was pretty damn rocking live.

55:29.885 --> 55:35.323
* I feel fine to be dancin', baby *

55:36.992 --> 55:42.398
* I feel fine I'm a shakin' leaf *

55:44.032 --> 55:47.135
* I feel fine to be dancin', baby **

55:47.168 --> 55:50.639
Festivals that, that
became bigger and where we..

55:50.672 --> 55:53.475
Where we were stating to get more notice

55:53.509 --> 55:57.245
happened in the summer of '70

55:57.278 --> 55:59.381
after we completed Fun House

55:59.415 --> 56:01.149
and, uh, and we would generally go out

56:01.182 --> 56:04.820
and a-a-as people often do,
play that whole work

56:04.853 --> 56:09.558
and we were pretty much ignoring
the stuff from the first album.

56:09.591 --> 56:12.260
And, uh, I remembered

56:12.293 --> 56:15.096
I read a q-quote
from Johnny Ramone once

56:15.130 --> 56:18.834
he went to see us and apparently
there were too many new songs

56:18.867 --> 56:21.369
that he didn't know
and he was disgusted.

56:24.139 --> 56:26.508
Since we broke away for our message

56:26.542 --> 56:28.276
Iggy has been in the crowd

56:28.309 --> 56:31.513
and out again three different times.

56:31.547 --> 56:34.916
They seem to be enjoying it
and so does he.

56:44.225 --> 56:49.465
The group was always very aware

56:49.498 --> 56:52.367
of the theatrics of the moment.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.736
And they never moved, ever.

56:54.770 --> 56:59.040
In 40 minutes, the drummer
would never look up

56:59.074 --> 57:03.645
and, uh, the other two
might move a foot or two.

57:03.679 --> 57:05.747
We never knew what would happen

57:05.781 --> 57:08.049
and so, in the old days, you know

57:08.083 --> 57:10.652
we just literally, I mean, it could be

57:10.686 --> 57:12.153
we'd be out there, you know..

57:14.322 --> 57:15.824
You know, and there's no vocals.

57:15.857 --> 57:17.659
You know, the guy's out in the crowd.

57:17.693 --> 57:19.828
He's down on the floor
somewhere, you know

57:19.861 --> 57:21.630
there's no vocal, so we're still going..

57:23.298 --> 57:26.067
So until he starts singing,
we don't do anything.

57:26.101 --> 57:29.605
And, uh, and then, you know
eventually he'll climb back up

57:29.638 --> 57:31.740
and start singing and that's, you know

57:31.773 --> 57:33.675
it's all about,
you know, working together

57:33.709 --> 57:35.176
to, to make a show.

57:35.210 --> 57:37.245
You know, the way he works a gig

57:37.278 --> 57:41.116
it reminds you that life,
big time, is in the moment.

57:41.149 --> 57:42.751
M-maybe most of it.

57:42.784 --> 57:45.487
But the moment is really intense about

57:45.521 --> 57:46.855
what's going down because

57:46.888 --> 57:48.790
you know, "I feel like
a short-order cook.

57:48.824 --> 57:50.959
"I gotta get everybody's order.

57:50.992 --> 57:52.961
You want fries?
You want a shake?"

57:52.994 --> 57:54.763
You know, he's going out, in his mind

57:54.796 --> 57:56.732
he says, he's going to the crowd.

57:59.501 --> 58:03.138
It was important to make contact

58:03.171 --> 58:05.941
I felt at every show.

58:05.974 --> 58:08.777
And we were opening for
"The Mothers of Invention"

58:08.810 --> 58:11.379
that was the best group,
in my estimation

58:11.412 --> 58:13.281
that we'd ever opened for.

58:13.314 --> 58:16.217
So, near the end of our set

58:16.251 --> 58:20.288
I was not sure we'd really
reached across.

58:20.321 --> 58:24.059
And there were
a couple of girls, big ones.

58:24.092 --> 58:26.628
They'd moved up
right in front of the stage

58:26.662 --> 58:29.064
and they just were laying there
on their backs

58:29.097 --> 58:31.667
making themselves
very comfortable, relaxing.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.635
And I got to the edge of the stage

58:33.669 --> 58:36.037
and I did what I'd seen little kids do

58:36.071 --> 58:38.874
sometimes when they want
attention from their parents.

58:38.907 --> 58:42.811
I thought, I'm just gonna fall forward

58:42.844 --> 58:45.914
they'll catch me, and, uh

58:45.947 --> 58:47.883
they moved. I..

58:47.916 --> 58:51.653
My, uh, my front teeth
which I've since had repaired

58:51.687 --> 58:53.755
went straight through one of my lips.

58:53.789 --> 58:57.593
Sometimes it was eventful,
sometimes it was, listen..

58:57.626 --> 59:01.663
I-I-I was a guy,
very young, in a rock band

59:01.697 --> 59:03.832
and having beautiful summers
in the Midwest.

59:03.865 --> 59:06.835
So, so-sometimes I'd just
go down there, and, you know

59:06.868 --> 59:09.705
see some chick and go,
"Hey, what's your number?"

59:09.738 --> 59:12.240
You will come to me
whenever I call you...

59:13.742 --> 59:16.578
...and I will enjoy that very much.

59:16.612 --> 59:18.747
I had seen a lot of pictures

59:18.780 --> 59:21.750
of the, the Pharaohs and, um

59:21.783 --> 59:23.619
and some of their
a-atttendants.

59:23.652 --> 59:27.222
Egyptian iconography
I guess you'd call it.

59:27.255 --> 59:29.591
And it impressed me that the Pharaohs

59:29.625 --> 59:31.526
seldom wore shirts.

59:31.559 --> 59:33.028
Here in a minute

59:33.061 --> 59:35.530
end of all these announcements
we're gonna...

59:35.563 --> 59:37.432
...we're gonna have a big ceremony

59:37.465 --> 59:39.067
and we're gonna plant the seeds

59:39.100 --> 59:42.270
and then we're gonna
light the joint and celebrate.

59:47.676 --> 59:50.311
* Hey hey mama tell you now *

59:50.345 --> 59:52.247
* I was gonna die.. *

59:55.416 --> 59:57.886
That particular festival

59:57.919 --> 59:59.554
came along at a time

59:59.587 --> 01:00:01.556
when all the different
free-love

01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:05.393
free-wheeling, free-roaming
social groups in Detroit

01:00:05.426 --> 01:00:08.096
were all starting to sizzle up

01:00:08.129 --> 01:00:10.231
in the frying pan of drugs.

01:00:10.265 --> 01:00:12.233
We all got so stoned.

01:00:16.504 --> 01:00:21.009
I was in a tent with some wild people

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:24.412
and I took so much of

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.114
what I thought was coke

01:00:26.147 --> 01:00:29.751
before the thing that I had amnesia

01:00:29.785 --> 01:00:31.853
accompanied by

01:00:31.887 --> 01:00:34.756
a vertical malfunction with my vision.

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.992
Like the sort of thing
that used to happen

01:00:37.025 --> 01:00:39.795
with televisions of that era
when the picture

01:00:39.828 --> 01:00:41.863
would keep flipping over and over.

01:00:41.897 --> 01:00:43.498
Couldn't remember who I was

01:00:43.531 --> 01:00:46.034
and then finally I remembered
there was something

01:00:46.067 --> 01:00:47.635
I had to do.

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:12.694
* Out of my mind on Saturday night *

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:16.631
* 1970 rollin' in sight *

01:01:16.664 --> 01:01:19.634
Dave, he just went
all the way out that night.

01:01:19.667 --> 01:01:23.038
He got extremely drunk before the show

01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:24.672
and he couldn't play the songs.

01:01:24.706 --> 01:01:26.307
One of the road crew went out

01:01:26.341 --> 01:01:28.476
and turned his volume
all the way off on his amp

01:01:28.509 --> 01:01:30.746
and he kept playing
he didn't even realize

01:01:30.779 --> 01:01:32.748
that his amp wasn't on.

01:01:32.781 --> 01:01:34.249
We had a good billing

01:01:34.282 --> 01:01:37.052
Danny had brought important people

01:01:37.085 --> 01:01:39.354
from New York to see us.

01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:43.224
We were on the same bill with,
uh, Rod Stewart and the "Faces"

01:01:43.258 --> 01:01:45.426
we wanted to do well, we got out there

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.862
there's no bass.

01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:49.697
So, I was extra aggressive.

01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:52.400
I did try to get to the fence.

01:01:54.702 --> 01:01:57.005
Um, I was prevented.

01:01:57.038 --> 01:02:00.008
There was an actual trench dug

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:02.110
and there were horse police.

01:02:03.378 --> 01:02:06.047
And so I started calling, "Come on!

01:02:06.081 --> 01:02:07.849
Tear that fence."

01:02:07.883 --> 01:02:10.585
I think I mentioned
"Tear the fence down."

01:02:12.487 --> 01:02:15.390
Lead Stooge is freaked out.

01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:17.926
I think the fence took a couple of hits.

01:02:17.959 --> 01:02:19.861
He jumped over the fence

01:02:19.895 --> 01:02:22.463
and we've lost power on the amp.

01:02:22.497 --> 01:02:25.100
I don't remember being arrested.

01:02:25.133 --> 01:02:28.436
I remember just sitting
after the gig, really like

01:02:28.469 --> 01:02:31.139
still whacked out,
and watching Ronnie Wood

01:02:31.172 --> 01:02:33.909
and Rod Stewart drinking Mateus

01:02:33.942 --> 01:02:36.111
to get ready for their show.

01:02:36.144 --> 01:02:38.780
That was their, uh,
intoxicant of choice.

01:02:48.423 --> 01:02:52.460
Iggy fired him, but not really

01:02:52.493 --> 01:02:55.931
cause Dave wanted to be let go.

01:02:55.964 --> 01:02:59.334
Yeah, I felt bad but, um...

01:02:59.367 --> 01:03:02.403
...I also felt there's no sense
in having someone in the band

01:03:02.437 --> 01:03:06.441
that's not serious, who doesn't
really want to be in the band.

01:03:07.843 --> 01:03:10.378
We remained friends after.

01:03:11.712 --> 01:03:13.114
* Damn *

01:03:18.453 --> 01:03:21.789
His parents called me up,
said he was in the hospital.

01:03:21.823 --> 01:03:25.493
What it was was an inflamed pancreas

01:03:26.794 --> 01:03:29.197
which he could have survived

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.799
but they had an IV in him...

01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:36.104
...and he wanted it out,
and he wanted to go home

01:03:36.137 --> 01:03:37.839
and he wanted a beer.

01:03:39.307 --> 01:03:41.977
So they sedated him to a point

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.112
to where he was unconscious

01:03:44.145 --> 01:03:47.548
and when he was unconscious,
he got pneumonia

01:03:47.582 --> 01:03:49.817
and the pneumonia killed him.

01:03:53.654 --> 01:03:55.556
He'd recorded two albums

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:59.560
he, um, became to be in a

01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:02.630
famous rock and roll band.

01:04:02.663 --> 01:04:07.135
He had accomplished
what he wanted to do.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:09.004
He was ready to go.

01:04:09.037 --> 01:04:11.706
* ...do you feel it? *

01:04:11.739 --> 01:04:16.544
* Said do you feel it
when you touch me? *

01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:23.384
* And do you feel it
when you touch me? *

01:04:24.852 --> 01:04:26.854
* There's a fire *

01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:30.558
* There's a fire *

01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:40.301
* Oh it's just a dreaming *

01:04:41.402 --> 01:04:47.542
* I just wanna be dreaming *

01:04:51.146 --> 01:04:53.614
I'd been using psychedelics.

01:04:56.884 --> 01:04:59.587
They were probably
cut with a lot of speed.

01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:05.226
God, no! No! No! No!

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.762
I began to have problems
controlling my nerves.

01:05:07.795 --> 01:05:09.864
Get me out of this terrible place!

01:05:09.897 --> 01:05:12.267
That was about the time that one guy

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.036
who lived in our house,
a guy named John Adams

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:17.872
didn't have much to do in his life..

01:05:17.905 --> 01:05:19.975
Here. Lookey here.

01:05:20.008 --> 01:05:22.210
Decided he wanted to take up

01:05:22.243 --> 01:05:24.379
an old heroin addiction.

01:05:24.412 --> 01:05:26.914
- What's H?
- Shh! Not so loud.

01:05:26.948 --> 01:05:30.418
And uh... I fell into that.

01:05:33.021 --> 01:05:35.490
As did other members of the group.

01:05:37.492 --> 01:05:39.560
Everything just decayed.

01:05:39.594 --> 01:05:40.761
And to see those guys

01:05:40.795 --> 01:05:43.164
just to see everyone hit rock bottom

01:05:43.198 --> 01:05:44.599
to see your whole world crumble

01:05:44.632 --> 01:05:46.601
when it's not really your fault.

01:05:46.634 --> 01:05:49.404
And I never did it, and never wanted to.

01:05:49.437 --> 01:05:52.740
Aside from us just being
flat out unreliable

01:05:52.773 --> 01:05:55.443
uh, we, we had Scotty Asheton

01:05:55.476 --> 01:05:57.678
was driving the equipment truck one day.

01:05:57.712 --> 01:06:00.815
It's like a-a bridge
with whatever, ten feet or

01:06:00.848 --> 01:06:05.286
eleven feet clearance, and
truck's twelve feet, you know?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.157
That's the metaphor of
the early Stooges, that's it.

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.691
The van's destroyed

01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:14.195
the instruments that
they rented are destroyed.

01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:15.863
The bridge is destroyed.

01:06:23.838 --> 01:06:26.641
They were victims of their own, um...

01:06:28.143 --> 01:06:30.645
...lack of professionalism.

01:06:30.678 --> 01:06:35.216
* Down on the street
where the faces shine *

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.386
But they were also
the victims of other forces

01:06:38.419 --> 01:06:41.722
that we could call anti-art.

01:06:44.759 --> 01:06:47.628
"The Stooges" record Fun House

01:06:47.662 --> 01:06:50.531
so we're at the point
where Elektra has to decide

01:06:50.565 --> 01:06:55.136
whether or not to pick up
the option for a third album.

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:58.473
William S. Harvey and I
went out to Ann Arbor

01:06:58.506 --> 01:07:00.808
went to Stooge Hall, and they played

01:07:00.841 --> 01:07:02.510
what were the songs

01:07:02.543 --> 01:07:04.345
that were going to be their new songs

01:07:04.379 --> 01:07:06.414
and I just thought "Yes.

01:07:06.447 --> 01:07:08.983
"The music is what I loved

01:07:09.016 --> 01:07:11.219
and there's more of it."

01:07:11.252 --> 01:07:14.389
They were accelerating
from where they started

01:07:14.422 --> 01:07:17.092
they were better, but
that made no difference to him.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.427
And we got into our rental car

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:23.331
went back to the hotel,
we got in the elevator and..

01:07:23.364 --> 01:07:26.834
"So, Bill, what'd you think?"

01:07:26.867 --> 01:07:29.104
And he said
"I didn't hear a thing."

01:07:29.137 --> 01:07:31.406
Got out of the elevator,
the elevator door closed

01:07:31.439 --> 01:07:34.242
I called them up, and I said
"You're being dropped."

01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:37.712
"I didn't hear a thing."

01:07:37.745 --> 01:07:40.014
That says it all.

01:08:01.236 --> 01:08:03.738
They didn't hear a thing from day one.

01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:06.107
They had the world's
greatest band sitting there

01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:07.875
they didn't hear a thing.

01:08:07.908 --> 01:08:11.412
And that's kind of what the world said.

01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:16.451
I don't think they formally
dropped me, but they said

01:08:16.484 --> 01:08:21.288
"Look here's a, here's a
Nikon camera, as a gift.

01:08:21.322 --> 01:08:23.224
Go away for awhile."

01:08:23.258 --> 01:08:26.727
And so I scurried off to clean up

01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:30.598
and shut down the band for a while.

01:08:30.631 --> 01:08:35.569
My parents were very friendly
with a pharmacist

01:08:35.603 --> 01:08:39.174
who completely illegally,
without a prescription

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:41.975
ordered, uh, a bottle

01:08:42.009 --> 01:08:44.912
of liquid methadone

01:08:44.944 --> 01:08:47.615
for my exclusive daily use.

01:08:47.648 --> 01:08:51.085
This was a few miles,
couple of miles from our trailer

01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:53.087
on the edge-edge of Ann Arbor.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.256
And I would usually walk

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.692
in the morning over there

01:08:57.725 --> 01:08:59.960
to take a small dose

01:08:59.993 --> 01:09:01.962
that he would personally give me

01:09:01.996 --> 01:09:03.764
from this family pharmacist.

01:09:03.798 --> 01:09:06.501
I got to the point,
I could go a few days

01:09:07.202 --> 01:09:09.002
without anything.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.044
And that was
when I... went to New York.

01:09:17.077 --> 01:09:18.613
Iggy and I were sitting on my bed

01:09:18.645 --> 01:09:22.817
we'd fallen asleep to some
black and white Western

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:25.653
and Lisa called me and she said

01:09:25.685 --> 01:09:28.988
"Oh, is-is Iggy with you?"
I said, "Oh yeah."

01:09:29.023 --> 01:09:32.227
She said "Well, I'm with
David Bowie, we're at Max's

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.894
he really wants to meet Iggy."

01:09:33.928 --> 01:09:36.964
I went down there and met this

01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:40.901
th-this manager, Tony Defries.

01:09:40.935 --> 01:09:45.473
I met David, who was... cool.

01:09:45.506 --> 01:09:48.643
They were going back to England,
I went back to Detroit

01:09:48.676 --> 01:09:50.810
and there an, there was an understanding

01:09:50.845 --> 01:09:53.481
that at a later date

01:09:53.514 --> 01:09:57.552
um, they would arrange,
uh, for me to go to London

01:09:57.585 --> 01:09:59.320
and make some sort of a recording.

01:10:06.761 --> 01:10:11.165
They had somehow and someway
signed me to something

01:10:11.198 --> 01:10:14.602
and, uh, using that in turn, uh

01:10:14.635 --> 01:10:19.073
uh, s-signed a deal
whereby they got some money

01:10:19.106 --> 01:10:21.442
from Columbia for my services.

01:10:21.476 --> 01:10:25.012
Like that chick Pebbles
that signed up TLC

01:10:25.045 --> 01:10:30.050
or, uh, Lou Pearlman
with the boy band "NSYNC."

01:10:30.084 --> 01:10:31.919
It was one of those contracts.

01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:35.356
It was in-insane work demands

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:39.126
uh, ridiculous splits
of money. Uh..

01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:42.229
I didn't really understand...

01:10:42.263 --> 01:10:46.601
...who owned what, with who I,
with whom I was signed.

01:10:46.634 --> 01:10:50.070
I was in the big bad world now,
I was not..

01:10:50.104 --> 01:10:51.872
I-I-I was not the, uh, uh..

01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:55.476
I wasn-I wasn't
a teenage communist anymore.

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:58.279
This fella, Tony Defries, what I thought

01:10:58.313 --> 01:11:02.417
was gonna be an effective,
and was an effective flamboyant

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:04.585
theatrical management style

01:11:04.619 --> 01:11:07.054
based on Colonel Tom Parker

01:11:07.087 --> 01:11:08.923
with the big cigar

01:11:08.956 --> 01:11:12.627
big Afro hair,
and a great big mink coat.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.396
But in the interim I decided

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:19.233
I wanted to re-retain
my Detroit identity

01:11:19.266 --> 01:11:22.437
and, uh, told them in advance

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:25.673
"You gotta bring
James Williamson with me."

01:11:28.008 --> 01:11:29.510
* Alright *

01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:32.947
* Whoo *

01:11:35.049 --> 01:11:38.686
I guess he was trying
to capture the attitude

01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:41.656
that I had, which I did
have quite a bit of attitude

01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:44.191
when I first started, uh, out.

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:47.027
You know, I didn't really
have any framework for anything

01:11:47.061 --> 01:11:50.598
I was, what? You know,
not even twenty years old yet.

01:11:50.631 --> 01:11:54.001
And I, um, I didn't have any skills.

01:11:54.034 --> 01:11:56.937
And so, all I could do
was play the guitar.

01:11:56.971 --> 01:11:58.939
I went from living

01:11:58.973 --> 01:12:01.842
on my sisters couch

01:12:01.876 --> 01:12:06.814
literally, to getting
a phone call from Ig and saying

01:12:06.847 --> 01:12:09.717
"You know, tomorrow,
we have a plane ticket for you

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.553
and you're going to London."
Right?

01:12:12.587 --> 01:12:15.490
And so I-I just, I-I

01:12:15.523 --> 01:12:18.459
I got my guitar and I left

01:12:18.493 --> 01:12:20.795
and my sister didn't
even know where I was.

01:12:20.828 --> 01:12:24.131
You know, I mean, my girlfriend
called and-and she goes

01:12:24.164 --> 01:12:26.734
"Well, I don't know where
he is" and-and the girl goes

01:12:26.767 --> 01:12:28.803
"Well, is his guitar there?"

01:12:28.836 --> 01:12:31.005
And she said, "No" And she goes

01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:33.007
"Alright, he's gone."

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.744
So James and I got to Heathrow,
and, uh, you know

01:12:36.777 --> 01:12:40.881
and the cops took
one look at us and thought..

01:12:40.915 --> 01:12:44.719
"Undesirable, no money.
What are you doing?

01:12:44.752 --> 01:12:46.887
"What do you mean, you think
you're not going anywhere.

01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:49.356
You're-you're going
into this holding tank."

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.226
And, uh, it took us a while
to contact Defries

01:12:52.259 --> 01:12:56.597
on the phone and he came down
and signed for us.

01:12:56.631 --> 01:12:58.999
I don't think he ever really wanted us.

01:12:59.033 --> 01:13:01.769
I think David Bowie was interested

01:13:01.802 --> 01:13:04.171
in working with American artists

01:13:04.204 --> 01:13:05.840
who he admired at the time.

01:13:05.873 --> 01:13:09.510
I also think there was a bit of
an American invasion planned.

01:13:09.544 --> 01:13:13.347
Ultimately, they were hoping
to probably have us produced

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:18.118
by David Bowie who had
a parallel career in production

01:13:18.152 --> 01:13:21.856
and he was producing Lou Reed's
album around the same time.

01:13:21.889 --> 01:13:23.758
It wasn't what I wanted to do.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:28.062
I would've been polite
about the, uh, backup musicians

01:13:28.095 --> 01:13:31.432
but the-the names
bandied about were people

01:13:31.466 --> 01:13:33.434
who had already been
in the "Pink Fairies."

01:13:38.739 --> 01:13:40.941
When I investigated the "Pink Fairies"

01:13:40.975 --> 01:13:43.878
it sorta looked to me like an amalgam

01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:46.781
of the ideas that had
already been thrashed out

01:13:46.814 --> 01:13:48.816
by the "MC5" and Alice Cooper.

01:13:48.849 --> 01:13:51.385
It wasn't right for us, I thought.

01:13:51.418 --> 01:13:55.456
I talked them into, uh, bringing

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:57.391
two more Stooges

01:13:57.424 --> 01:13:59.059
over from America.

01:14:11.706 --> 01:14:13.641
* I'm hungry *

01:14:18.145 --> 01:14:20.180
* I'm hungry *

01:14:20.214 --> 01:14:21.616
We had a vision

01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:23.250
and we started rehearsing in earnest

01:14:23.283 --> 01:14:27.855
in a filthy basement,
and, uh, started getting tight.

01:14:27.888 --> 01:14:31.358
The song-writing
wasn't really there yet

01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:34.762
but the... the grooves

01:14:34.795 --> 01:14:36.997
the, um, the force was.

01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:39.366
Some of the songs we had already written

01:14:39.399 --> 01:14:40.768
and brought in at that time

01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:42.102
were "I Got A Right"

01:14:42.136 --> 01:14:43.538
"Gimme Some Skin"

01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:44.639
"Tight Pants."

01:14:44.672 --> 01:14:46.774
Which later showed up as

01:14:46.807 --> 01:14:49.677
"Shake Appeal on Raw Power."

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.679
We did some demo sessions

01:14:51.712 --> 01:14:54.181
w-a, at a little eight track

01:14:54.214 --> 01:14:57.151
called R.G. Jones in Wimbledon

01:14:57.184 --> 01:14:59.319
and those were good demo sessions.

01:15:09.997 --> 01:15:11.732
Then later...

01:15:11.766 --> 01:15:14.301
...we did, uh, we did a little

01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:16.537
little more formal session in

01:15:16.571 --> 01:15:19.406
Olympic Studios with Keith Harwood

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:22.342
who was The Stones engineer at that time

01:15:22.376 --> 01:15:25.079
and that's the recording
of "I Got A Right"

01:15:25.112 --> 01:15:27.815
that's become so popular, since it's

01:15:27.848 --> 01:15:31.151
fast as lightning and kicks like a mule.

01:15:38.559 --> 01:15:41.495
* Anytime I want I got a right to move *

01:15:41.528 --> 01:15:43.798
* No matter what they say *

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.836
* Anytime I want I got a right to move *

01:15:48.869 --> 01:15:51.038
* No matter what they say *

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.443
* I got a right I got a right to move *

01:15:56.476 --> 01:15:59.714
* Anywhere I want anywhere *

01:15:59.747 --> 01:16:02.917
It was our best effort, uh, to, to..

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.919
To make hit records, basically.

01:16:04.952 --> 01:16:07.622
We wanted-we wanted
to make a good record

01:16:07.655 --> 01:16:11.626
um, but the, the thing about us is that

01:16:11.659 --> 01:16:13.694
w-we're so delusional about

01:16:13.728 --> 01:16:15.763
what is popular, you know

01:16:15.796 --> 01:16:19.033
because all we really care about
is what we like.

01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:21.535
Sometime, I don't know
if it was late fall

01:16:21.568 --> 01:16:23.570
somebody knows.

01:16:23.604 --> 01:16:25.205
We, uh..

01:16:25.239 --> 01:16:28.709
We had-we had written
the second batch of material

01:16:28.743 --> 01:16:30.377
that was gonna be "Raw Power."

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:33.614
And eventually, they just
all got busy with Bowie

01:16:33.648 --> 01:16:34.915
and left us in the studio

01:16:34.949 --> 01:16:37.051
cause we owed a record to CBS

01:16:37.084 --> 01:16:39.787
and that's where "Raw Power"
came out of and

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.823
and we really, you know,
I-I've said this before

01:16:42.857 --> 01:16:45.993
we were just left
without any adult supervision

01:16:46.026 --> 01:16:47.762
I mean, we just did our thing.

01:17:06.013 --> 01:17:07.748
* I'm a street walking cheetah *

01:17:07.782 --> 01:17:10.785
* With a heart full of napalm *

01:17:12.219 --> 01:17:16.356
* I'm a runaway son
of the nuclear A-bomb *

01:17:18.859 --> 01:17:21.762
* I am a world's forgotten boy *

01:17:21.796 --> 01:17:25.599
* The one who searches and destroys *

01:17:25.632 --> 01:17:29.203
As a guitarist, James fills the space

01:17:29.236 --> 01:17:33.207
as if somebody's just let
a drug dog into your house

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.842
and it's big.

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:38.746
And he-he finds every corner...

01:17:40.214 --> 01:17:43.650
...of a musical premise

01:17:43.684 --> 01:17:47.321
and of a piece of space and time

01:17:47.354 --> 01:17:49.990
and fills it up with detail.

01:17:50.024 --> 01:17:52.960
It's a very detailed approach

01:17:52.993 --> 01:17:57.064
and it's really hard to find
a space to say something

01:17:57.097 --> 01:17:59.466
that he hasn't thought of or occupied.

01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:04.504
* Somebody gotta save my soul *

01:18:04.538 --> 01:18:07.274
* Baby penetrates my mind *

01:18:11.078 --> 01:18:15.182
* And I'm the world's forgotten boy *

01:18:16.751 --> 01:18:21.655
* The one who's searchin'
searchin' to destroy oh *

01:18:21.688 --> 01:18:24.925
And so Ron plays a sort of
a nimble bass style

01:18:24.959 --> 01:18:27.828
and it really-really helps

01:18:27.862 --> 01:18:29.997
lift James, my vocals

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:31.665
I had to go way up high

01:18:31.698 --> 01:18:34.701
I'm-I'm an octave above

01:18:34.735 --> 01:18:38.005
Fun House to find a space

01:18:38.038 --> 01:18:41.075
that James isn't occupying.

01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:44.178
Uh, Scott solved the problem
by-by just beating

01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:46.580
the living shit out of his drums.

01:18:49.116 --> 01:18:54.121
* Look out honey 'cause
I'm using technology **

01:18:54.154 --> 01:18:56.390
The bass player and the drummer are

01:18:56.423 --> 01:18:59.593
the most important thing in
the band, other than the songs.

01:18:59.626 --> 01:19:01.528
You know, when those guys were together

01:19:01.561 --> 01:19:03.764
they were just like
this unit and, you know

01:19:03.798 --> 01:19:05.966
and it just was rock solid.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.602
It was so good,
it was really, really good.

01:19:08.635 --> 01:19:11.205
And that's what, uh,
unfortunately on Raw Power

01:19:11.238 --> 01:19:13.607
you don't actually hear the bass
that much

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.609
but it was there, it was good.

01:19:34.862 --> 01:19:37.297
The band from late 1971

01:19:37.331 --> 01:19:39.266
when we were signed with Main Man

01:19:39.299 --> 01:19:43.170
to early '72 or whenever
we went to London and began

01:19:43.203 --> 01:19:46.740
working with them, to early '73

01:19:46.773 --> 01:19:49.343
when they publically dropped us

01:19:49.376 --> 01:19:52.512
but privately told me
that I was suspended

01:19:52.546 --> 01:19:54.414
for moral turpitude

01:19:54.448 --> 01:19:56.616
and embarrassing their company

01:19:56.650 --> 01:20:00.154
they consistently refused

01:20:00.187 --> 01:20:03.157
to allow us to play a gig.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.525
And we were...
we were popular enough

01:20:05.559 --> 01:20:09.096
that we could have gone out
and earned most of our bacon.

01:20:09.129 --> 01:20:11.431
They wouldn't let us play.

01:20:11.465 --> 01:20:14.969
The situation brought out
our old weaknesses

01:20:15.002 --> 01:20:16.470
and we were told

01:20:16.503 --> 01:20:19.039
that we were gonna go live in Hollywood

01:20:19.073 --> 01:20:22.943
in this firm Main Man house there.

01:20:22.977 --> 01:20:24.845
And it was oil and water

01:20:24.879 --> 01:20:27.614
James Williamson behaved badly

01:20:27.647 --> 01:20:30.117
Iggy Pop behaved badly

01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:33.320
Scott Asheton just looked at the floor

01:20:33.353 --> 01:20:34.855
and let it roll

01:20:34.889 --> 01:20:37.958
and Ron Asheton was embittered

01:20:37.992 --> 01:20:40.527
and powerless and threw up his hands

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.998
and the group drifted into drugs.

01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:47.167
Again, this embarrassed these people.

01:20:47.201 --> 01:20:51.205
Defries came through town
one day in a limo.

01:20:51.238 --> 01:20:54.208
I think he was gonna talk to me
about something

01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:57.978
they could do with me
that didn't involve these guys

01:20:58.012 --> 01:20:59.880
that would

01:20:59.914 --> 01:21:01.815
put a positive spin

01:21:01.848 --> 01:21:04.418
on his investment with me.

01:21:04.451 --> 01:21:07.421
And he got me into his limo
and he said, "James..

01:21:08.956 --> 01:21:12.726
"...I want to tell you
what we're going to do.

01:21:12.759 --> 01:21:14.494
"We're going to take you to New York

01:21:14.528 --> 01:21:16.830
"to Broadway

01:21:16.863 --> 01:21:20.234
and you're going to be
Peter Pan."

01:21:20.267 --> 01:21:23.670
* If I'm pleased with myself *

01:21:23.703 --> 01:21:26.040
* I have every good reason to be **

01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:30.010
And I, with deep sincerity

01:21:30.044 --> 01:21:32.246
an-and I mean this.

01:21:32.279 --> 01:21:36.483
I said, "No, no, no, Tony.

01:21:39.819 --> 01:21:42.089
"I've gotta be Manson.

01:21:42.122 --> 01:21:44.358
We've gotta make a movie."

01:21:44.391 --> 01:21:47.027
He dropped me off and it was

01:21:47.061 --> 01:21:48.695
just a couple days after that

01:21:48.728 --> 01:21:52.532
that the rest of us
got thrown out of the house.

01:21:52.566 --> 01:21:54.701
The brothers moved back to Detroit.

01:21:54.734 --> 01:21:57.371
Later on, Iggy and I

01:21:57.404 --> 01:21:58.738
decided we would

01:21:58.772 --> 01:22:01.108
give it another whirl.

01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:03.710
And so we, uh, we created

01:22:03.743 --> 01:22:06.646
what later became "Kill City."

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.916
We lucked out,
we-we had a friend, Jimmy Webb

01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:12.286
he had a studio in his house.

01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:14.154
It was funny, I mean,
you know, you'd have guys like

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:16.656
Art Garfunkel come in to the session

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:18.158
he'd listen to play backs

01:22:18.192 --> 01:22:20.227
and then they would just leave,
you know?

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.964
And without anybody,
any takers for the album

01:22:23.998 --> 01:22:26.933
we-we, we just called it quits.

01:22:28.168 --> 01:22:31.371
Jim went off with Bowie to Europe...

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.676
...and I went to work
for a recording studio

01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:40.647
but I, um, quickly realized
that there's only one thing

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.150
worse than playing in a band
you don't like

01:22:43.183 --> 01:22:47.587
and that's recording
five or ten bands every day

01:22:47.621 --> 01:22:48.922
that you can't stand.

01:22:48.955 --> 01:22:51.758
So, I-I really wasn't
very cut out for that

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:54.428
but I did learn a lot,
and it stimulated, uh

01:22:54.461 --> 01:22:57.431
an interest in electronics,
and at that time

01:22:57.464 --> 01:23:00.667
it was the very, very beginning
of the personal computer

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.869
and so I went off and I learned

01:23:02.902 --> 01:23:05.339
how to do all that stuff.

01:23:05.372 --> 01:23:07.707
I'll tell ya, uh, when I was

01:23:07.741 --> 01:23:09.609
uh, studying engineering

01:23:09.643 --> 01:23:12.946
to go from "The Stooges" to calculus

01:23:12.979 --> 01:23:15.615
was a huge existential gap.

01:23:19.353 --> 01:23:21.788
So I went and moved
to the Silicon Valley

01:23:21.821 --> 01:23:24.724
and started working
in the electronics industry

01:23:24.758 --> 01:23:27.961
so, and I've been there ever
since, I mean, that's been

01:23:27.994 --> 01:23:30.664
uh, 27 year career.

01:23:42.376 --> 01:23:44.010
After "The Stooges" collapsed

01:23:44.044 --> 01:23:45.812
Ron first joined "New Order"

01:23:45.845 --> 01:23:49.883
and then he did "Destroy
All Monsters" with Niagara.

01:24:16.743 --> 01:24:19.846
I played five years in
the "Sonic Rendezvous Band"

01:24:19.879 --> 01:24:22.282
with Fred Smith, and, um..

01:24:22.316 --> 01:24:24.518
He married Patty Smith.

01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:28.455
And once he did that was
the end of the band.

01:24:28.488 --> 01:24:30.224
Went on another five years

01:24:30.257 --> 01:24:34.394
playing with Scott Morgan without Fred

01:24:34.428 --> 01:24:37.797
making $30, $40 a night.

01:24:37.831 --> 01:24:41.701
Three sets a night.

01:24:41.735 --> 01:24:44.338
I'd have day jobs.

01:24:45.639 --> 01:24:47.874
Warehousing

01:24:47.907 --> 01:24:50.377
landscaping

01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:53.680
for two years I drove a taxi cab.

01:24:55.249 --> 01:24:57.451
Just crummy jobs.

01:25:02.356 --> 01:25:05.058
I think that "The Stooges"

01:25:05.091 --> 01:25:08.061
reinvented music as we know it.

01:25:08.094 --> 01:25:12.632
If I say that "The Stooges"
music is-is point zero

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:16.670
The "Ramones,"
who were a great love of mine

01:25:16.703 --> 01:25:18.672
after that

01:25:18.705 --> 01:25:22.242
knew each other not because
they liked each other

01:25:22.276 --> 01:25:23.743
because they were the only four people

01:25:23.777 --> 01:25:26.780
at their school
who liked "The Stooges."

01:25:26.813 --> 01:25:31.785
* I'm a street walking cheetah
with a heart full of napalm *

01:25:31.818 --> 01:25:35.389
* I'm a runaway son
of the nuclear A-bomb *

01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:39.459
* I am a world's forgotten boy *

01:25:39.493 --> 01:25:42.262
* The one who searches and destroys **

01:25:55.008 --> 01:25:58.278
Do you feel you've
influenced anybody in the..

01:25:58.312 --> 01:26:00.780
I think I helped wipe out the sixties

01:26:05.219 --> 01:26:07.454
You'll get one number
and one number only

01:26:07.487 --> 01:26:09.823
because I'm a lazy bastard.

01:26:12.826 --> 01:26:14.661
This is "No Fun."

01:26:28.442 --> 01:26:31.811
* No fun my babe *

01:26:31.845 --> 01:26:35.014
* No fun *

01:26:35.048 --> 01:26:38.352
* No fun my babe *

01:26:38.385 --> 01:26:40.520
* No fun *

01:26:42.188 --> 01:26:45.425
* ...want to be alone *

01:26:45.459 --> 01:26:48.528
* I'm out here by myself *

01:26:48.562 --> 01:26:52.165
* I don't want to be alone *

01:26:52.198 --> 01:26:55.168
* In love *

01:26:55.201 --> 01:26:57.604
* Nobody else *

01:26:59.205 --> 01:27:00.740
It's-it's Dionysiac.

01:27:00.774 --> 01:27:02.409
If you know the difference
between Dionysiac

01:27:02.442 --> 01:27:04.244
and Appolonian art.

01:27:27.401 --> 01:27:31.605
* Now I want to be your dog *

01:27:31.638 --> 01:27:35.809
* Now I want to be your dog *

01:27:44.418 --> 01:27:46.520
* Come on *

01:28:18.652 --> 01:28:22.255
* Yeah I do mean you

01:28:22.288 --> 01:28:25.091
* She got TV eye on me *

01:28:25.124 --> 01:28:27.527
There was a movie "Velvet Goldmine",

01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:30.096
in which one of the dudes
is a composite of

01:28:30.129 --> 01:28:32.799
Ig and they wanted like some kind of

01:28:32.832 --> 01:28:35.268
music coming from somebody
called "The Rats."

01:28:35.301 --> 01:28:36.836
They put Steve Shelley out

01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:38.705
because he's from Midland, Michigan

01:28:38.738 --> 01:28:41.274
to go with Ronny and he'd write songs

01:28:41.307 --> 01:28:42.776
and he comes to New York

01:28:42.809 --> 01:28:44.844
and we get to record with him, yeah.

01:28:44.878 --> 01:28:47.381
And here I got to sit across
and Thrust, too, you know.

01:28:47.414 --> 01:28:49.649
There's the guy doing the "TV Eye"

01:28:49.683 --> 01:28:52.285
we could see his hands and play along.

01:28:52.318 --> 01:28:53.753
It was a trip.

01:28:54.521 --> 01:28:56.523
Uh, I got sick

01:28:56.556 --> 01:28:58.825
when I was, uh, 42

01:28:58.858 --> 01:29:01.495
and it almost killed me, this infection.

01:29:01.528 --> 01:29:03.697
They had to put tubes in me

01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:05.865
and I couldn't work bass,
so it was the first time

01:29:05.899 --> 01:29:08.668
I stopped since I was thirteen
and when I came back

01:29:08.702 --> 01:29:11.871
I was all atrophied and really lame.

01:29:11.905 --> 01:29:14.674
I thought you were not supposed
to lose that kinda stuff.

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:16.576
So I panicked and then started doing

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:19.145
Stooges songs to get strong

01:29:19.178 --> 01:29:22.816
and I put together some bands
just to do this.

01:29:22.849 --> 01:29:26.386
There's not chord changes
but it's a lot about the feel.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:27.587
So, "Little Doll," "Little Doll"

01:29:27.621 --> 01:29:29.188
"Little Doll," "Little Doll."

01:29:29.222 --> 01:29:31.357
On the West Coast I did one
with Perk and Peter

01:29:31.391 --> 01:29:33.427
from "Porno for Pyros," and on the East

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.162
I did it with J and Murph from Dinosaur.

01:29:36.195 --> 01:29:38.998
Well J gets his solo album

01:29:39.032 --> 01:29:41.835
and he asks me to tour.

01:29:41.868 --> 01:29:44.003
He says, "Man, it's hard for me
to sing every song every night

01:29:44.037 --> 01:29:45.439
"so why don't you do some Stooges

01:29:45.472 --> 01:29:48.007
like we did with those gigs."

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.576
And when we come through
Ann Arbor, he says

01:29:49.609 --> 01:29:52.579
"You know Ronny" because of the..

01:29:52.612 --> 01:29:54.681
Now I got his, uh, phone number.

01:29:54.714 --> 01:29:57.083
I call him and he comes to the Blind Pig

01:29:57.116 --> 01:29:58.384
and he jams Stooges with us.

01:29:58.418 --> 01:30:01.020
So J says, "Come on tour!

01:30:01.054 --> 01:30:03.022
"First two thirds will be mine, and then

01:30:03.056 --> 01:30:05.191
the last third
we'll do Stooges."

01:30:05.224 --> 01:30:07.561
Then 2002 comes and, uh..

01:30:07.594 --> 01:30:10.129
Thurston is curating
a All Tomorrow Party

01:30:10.163 --> 01:30:11.598
at UCLA and he says

01:30:11.631 --> 01:30:13.132
"Why don't we get Scotty?"
You know.

01:30:13.166 --> 01:30:14.468
He was living in his truck.

01:30:14.501 --> 01:30:15.969
And so rent him a drum set and he comes

01:30:16.002 --> 01:30:18.772
so me and J are playing
with both Asheton brothers

01:30:18.805 --> 01:30:21.741
and we do some gigs in Europe...

01:30:21.775 --> 01:30:24.377
...and that's where I think
Ig heard about it.

01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:26.880
It was time for me to record again

01:30:26.913 --> 01:30:28.582
and, um..

01:30:28.615 --> 01:30:31.084
I'd run out of things to say.

01:30:32.185 --> 01:30:34.788
And my record label had, um...

01:30:34.821 --> 01:30:37.390
...run out of patience with, uh

01:30:37.423 --> 01:30:39.826
my middling sales

01:30:39.859 --> 01:30:42.395
on the last couple of albums.

01:30:42.428 --> 01:30:45.599
To pre-empt, uh, being produced

01:30:45.632 --> 01:30:48.401
which was, is,
was the kiss of death to me

01:30:48.434 --> 01:30:52.238
I offered to do a-a guest..

01:30:52.271 --> 01:30:53.473
A guest star album.

01:30:53.507 --> 01:30:55.408
I started listing everything

01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:57.911
everybody I thought of who was cool

01:30:57.944 --> 01:31:00.413
and then I realized
none of them are any as cool

01:31:00.446 --> 01:31:01.981
as "The Stooges."

01:31:10.624 --> 01:31:14.127
Sometimes just a,
a hop or two in front of me

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.696
playing with J. Masci
from Dinosaur Jr.

01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:20.099
I got a phone call oneday
from Ron Asheton...

01:31:20.133 --> 01:31:21.801
...and he was saying,
"Well, we're playing

01:31:21.835 --> 01:31:23.503
this thing with J. Mascis."

01:31:23.537 --> 01:31:26.439
J. Mascis

01:31:26.472 --> 01:31:28.207
pulled the whole thing together.

01:31:28.241 --> 01:31:29.442
J. Mascis.

01:31:39.052 --> 01:31:41.320
Then we did the Asheton, Asheton

01:31:41.354 --> 01:31:43.489
Mascis Watt thing

01:31:43.523 --> 01:31:45.959
which Jim got ear of

01:31:45.992 --> 01:31:48.662
cause people wanted to hear those songs

01:31:48.695 --> 01:31:50.864
and we were playing the old Stooge songs

01:31:50.897 --> 01:31:52.666
and getting good reviews

01:31:52.699 --> 01:31:56.169
so that sparked Jim...

01:31:56.202 --> 01:31:58.504
...to want to get the band
back together.

01:31:58.538 --> 01:32:02.375
I gave Ron a call, I still knew
the phone number was the same

01:32:02.408 --> 01:32:05.645
at his home from, uh, 1966

01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:08.682
and, uh, he said
"Yeah! I'll do it."

01:32:08.715 --> 01:32:11.484
I remember going to my mom's house

01:32:11.517 --> 01:32:14.220
Ronny was there

01:32:14.253 --> 01:32:17.223
and, uh, my mom's, you know

01:32:17.256 --> 01:32:19.593
I walk in and she's going

01:32:19.626 --> 01:32:22.662
"Guess who just called?"

01:32:22.696 --> 01:32:25.699
And I'm like, she goes "Iggy."

01:32:25.732 --> 01:32:27.834
And she was so excited, you know

01:32:27.867 --> 01:32:29.569
cause she was like..

01:32:29.603 --> 01:32:31.705
Thought it was the coolest thing
that Iggy called

01:32:31.738 --> 01:32:34.340
and the band's getting back together.

01:32:34.373 --> 01:32:38.011
So in a weird way, it was
the cats Don Fleming and Jimbo

01:32:38.044 --> 01:32:42.081
Dunbar who asked Ronny,
I mean, this is my guess

01:32:42.115 --> 01:32:44.383
to do that "Velvet Goldmine"
that kinda started

01:32:44.417 --> 01:32:46.219
the whole ball rolling.

01:32:46.252 --> 01:32:48.354
And then that sickness in a weird way

01:32:48.387 --> 01:32:51.090
and J saying "Come on aboard."

01:32:51.124 --> 01:32:54.027
He had... somehow, you know,
I don't know exactly

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:57.631
but I think this was the dynamic
that led to the...

01:32:57.664 --> 01:32:59.265
...2003 Coachella.

01:32:59.298 --> 01:33:02.301
Before we left
the st-left the studio

01:33:02.335 --> 01:33:05.772
we got a call from Coachella

01:33:05.805 --> 01:33:07.641
and they offered us a show.

01:33:07.674 --> 01:33:10.376
To be honest

01:33:10.409 --> 01:33:12.378
at what would be a good price

01:33:12.411 --> 01:33:15.882
for a Iggy Pop show, but, um..

01:33:15.915 --> 01:33:18.217
If I was gonna work with "The Stooges"

01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:21.921
we're communists!
We split all the money.

01:33:21.955 --> 01:33:25.258
So I had, uh, only way
I could do it was say

01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:27.761
"Well, you'd have to give us

01:33:27.794 --> 01:33:30.897
three times that,"
and I thought they'd go away

01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:34.734
and they came back
and said "Okay."

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:46.112
Woo!

01:33:48.614 --> 01:33:50.183
Ah!

01:33:51.484 --> 01:33:53.252
Everybody!

01:33:53.286 --> 01:33:54.954
Now look out!

01:34:02.829 --> 01:34:04.831
When the band got back together

01:34:04.864 --> 01:34:06.866
I was so happy.

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.469
It was a dream come true, it was just..

01:34:10.503 --> 01:34:13.272
Oh, my God, finally!

01:34:13.306 --> 01:34:15.775
I'm back with the band.

01:34:19.145 --> 01:34:20.980
I could tell that they really enjoyed

01:34:21.014 --> 01:34:23.116
playing with each other,
I could really tell

01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:25.151
that they were glad to be doing this

01:34:25.184 --> 01:34:27.553
even with all those years in between.

01:34:31.424 --> 01:34:32.892
Yeah!

01:34:37.163 --> 01:34:41.234
* I'm so messed up I want you here *

01:34:44.503 --> 01:34:45.839
* In my room *

01:34:45.872 --> 01:34:49.175
* I want you here *

01:34:49.208 --> 01:34:51.644
Certain parts of history

01:34:51.677 --> 01:34:53.679
have repeated themselves

01:34:53.713 --> 01:34:55.548
both in the history of this

01:34:55.581 --> 01:34:57.483
reunification of our group

01:34:57.516 --> 01:35:00.419
which, I prefer to call it
that rather than a reunion

01:35:00.453 --> 01:35:02.321
and one thing that

01:35:02.355 --> 01:35:05.158
happened was, uh, you know, we..

01:35:05.191 --> 01:35:09.495
We did a substantial period with

01:35:09.528 --> 01:35:11.197
with Ron doing the guitar.

01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:14.868
* Now I wanna be your dog *

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:22.308
* Well come on *

01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:32.285
The last time I saw him was,
uh, after the show.

01:35:32.318 --> 01:35:34.187
I opened the door

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.356
and-and he and Scotty
were sitting in profile

01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:39.859
at the end of the room
and they were surrounded

01:35:39.893 --> 01:35:44.030
by young Slovenian musicians.

01:35:44.063 --> 01:35:46.866
So I just saw that they were busy

01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:49.368
and, um, split.

01:35:49.402 --> 01:35:52.705
I last saw him in profile.

01:35:52.738 --> 01:35:54.473
He popped up in my dreams

01:35:54.507 --> 01:35:56.309
a few times since then...

01:35:57.476 --> 01:36:00.780
...and he never spoke or looked at me.

01:36:00.814 --> 01:36:03.216
It was always sort of

01:36:03.249 --> 01:36:06.552
more something like,
uh... you know.

01:36:06.585 --> 01:36:08.121
The guy in "The Third Man" or

01:36:08.154 --> 01:36:10.323
the guy in "The French Connection"

01:36:10.356 --> 01:36:12.125
always walking by

01:36:12.158 --> 01:36:15.761
and you can't quite catch him.

01:36:15.795 --> 01:36:17.763
He was a lot like that.

01:36:20.934 --> 01:36:22.735
When he passed away

01:36:22.768 --> 01:36:24.770
it coincided with James

01:36:24.804 --> 01:36:27.473
retirement as a Sony Executive

01:36:27.506 --> 01:36:28.808
and...

01:36:28.842 --> 01:36:31.610
...he wanted to rock

01:36:31.644 --> 01:36:34.080
and...

01:36:34.113 --> 01:36:37.683
...I was sure that there
was nothing else meaningful

01:36:37.716 --> 01:36:40.319
that the group could do other than

01:36:40.353 --> 01:36:44.323
do his,
do-do some things with him

01:36:44.357 --> 01:36:46.325
doing his material.

01:36:46.359 --> 01:36:50.296
And having just finally
done the right thing

01:36:50.329 --> 01:36:52.698
thirty years,
thirty-five years later

01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:54.600
with Ron's material

01:36:54.633 --> 01:36:57.303
to do the same thing for his
and complete the job.

01:36:57.336 --> 01:37:01.607
Iggy's talking to me about,
"Well, you wanna play guitar?"

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.377
and I'm going, "Well..

01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:06.445
"I don't know,
I mean, I haven't played guitar

01:37:06.479 --> 01:37:08.514
in thirty years, so.."

01:37:08.547 --> 01:37:11.851
Uh, but I, but I felt like that, uh..

01:37:11.885 --> 01:37:13.887
And this is the truth, is I felt

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.622
like that these guys were

01:37:16.655 --> 01:37:17.991
you know, they're my buddies

01:37:18.024 --> 01:37:20.226
I mean, I know these
guys from my twenties.

01:37:20.259 --> 01:37:23.629
And so, they needed me,
you know, to do this

01:37:23.662 --> 01:37:27.000
and I, I felt like
I needed to step up and do it.

01:37:27.033 --> 01:37:29.969
* Raw power it's a more than soul *

01:37:30.003 --> 01:37:32.471
* Got a son called rock and roll *

01:37:32.505 --> 01:37:35.641
* Raw power honey just won't quit *

01:37:35.674 --> 01:37:38.244
* Raw power I can feel it *

01:37:38.277 --> 01:37:41.214
* Raw power honey can't be beat *

01:37:41.247 --> 01:37:44.317
* Get down and a kiss my feet *

01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:47.153
* Everybody's always
tryin to tell me what to do *

01:37:47.186 --> 01:37:49.755
I really had no intention

01:37:49.788 --> 01:37:52.158
idea or wildest dream

01:37:52.191 --> 01:37:54.093
that I would be playing, you know

01:37:54.127 --> 01:37:55.828
guitar again for "The Stooges."

01:37:55.861 --> 01:37:59.265
I mean, it was really the
furthest thing from my mind.

01:38:15.314 --> 01:38:17.850
They were a group of the

01:38:17.883 --> 01:38:19.953
slightly more popular

01:38:19.986 --> 01:38:22.521
slightly more physically aggressive

01:38:22.555 --> 01:38:24.523
guys in my class.

01:38:24.557 --> 01:38:27.760
And there were about four
or five of them at the time.

01:38:27.793 --> 01:38:30.930
I'd been to one or two
of their homes, used to eat

01:38:30.964 --> 01:38:33.732
French fries with them across
the street from school.

01:38:33.766 --> 01:38:36.702
So one of them had a car
his dad had given him.

01:38:36.735 --> 01:38:38.104
They came out

01:38:38.137 --> 01:38:39.738
they did three things, one of them said

01:38:39.772 --> 01:38:43.109
"Yeah, look, his dad drives a Cadillac

01:38:43.142 --> 01:38:44.978
"and he lives in a trailer.

01:38:45.011 --> 01:38:46.912
Car's bigger than his house!"

01:38:46.946 --> 01:38:49.148
Few of 'em got together

01:38:49.182 --> 01:38:51.317
"Let's see if it shakes."

01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:55.221
And they started pushing it
and trying to shake

01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:57.490
the trailer on its foundations

01:38:57.523 --> 01:38:59.425
which it would not.

01:38:59.458 --> 01:39:01.894
Uh, but you did feel, you could feel it.

01:39:01.927 --> 01:39:05.131
Uh, yeah, I want to be friends
with these guys and, uh

01:39:05.164 --> 01:39:07.300
I admired certain things about them.

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:10.236
One of them jumped in the bathtub and

01:39:10.269 --> 01:39:12.005
made some sort of remark

01:39:12.038 --> 01:39:15.408
about the size of the, the bathroom.

01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:18.044
Ever since I've been out to get 'em.

01:39:19.645 --> 01:39:22.115
Ever since, you know.

01:39:22.148 --> 01:39:23.949
I'll bury those guys.

01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:33.426
Uh!

01:39:33.459 --> 01:39:38.331
We three here are the surviving Stooges.

01:39:42.135 --> 01:39:45.171
Ron and Dave woulda gotten
a big kick outta this

01:39:45.204 --> 01:39:48.774
and, uh, Ron was pissed off

01:39:48.807 --> 01:39:52.278
that it didn't happen
while he was alive.

01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:54.147
I don't know how he feels about it now

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.815
he's probably sitting up there in heaven

01:39:56.849 --> 01:39:59.385
having martinis with Brian Jones

01:39:59.418 --> 01:40:02.488
trying to flick ashes on our head.

01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:08.227
Music is life
and life is not a business.

01:40:09.762 --> 01:40:11.864
Ron Asheton knew this

01:40:11.897 --> 01:40:14.367
and Ron was cool.

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.636
The "MC5" are cool.

01:40:19.672 --> 01:40:23.676
My friend, Danny,
who discovered the band is cool

01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:25.844
and Nina, my beautiful wife

01:40:25.878 --> 01:40:27.513
you're cool!

01:40:29.014 --> 01:40:31.150
All the poor people

01:40:31.184 --> 01:40:33.486
who actually started

01:40:33.519 --> 01:40:35.921
rock and roll music are cool.

01:40:35.954 --> 01:40:37.156
Yeah!

01:40:40.059 --> 01:40:41.494
Thank you Stooge fans!

01:40:41.527 --> 01:40:43.196
There may be three of ya up there

01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:46.532
and I'll bet there's a couple
in the fancy seats.

01:40:47.533 --> 01:40:51.437
So thanks for being so... cool.

01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:58.211
Yeow!

01:41:17.563 --> 01:41:21.434
* I'm so messed up I want you here *

01:41:24.137 --> 01:41:27.806
* And in my room I want you here *

01:41:31.076 --> 01:41:34.580
* And now we're gonna be face to face *

01:41:37.015 --> 01:41:41.120

01:41:43.922 --> 01:41:47.393

* And now I wanna be a dog *

01:42:03.942 --> 01:42:05.944
* Now come on *

01:42:26.131 --> 01:42:29.134
Uh! Yeah!

01:42:29.168 --> 01:42:30.869
Come on, Ron!

01:42:30.903 --> 01:42:33.472
Play! Play!

01:42:43.382 --> 01:42:46.185
* I'm in fucking Detroit *

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.823
* I salute you now *

01:42:50.856 --> 01:42:55.528
* Now I'm ready to close my eyes *

01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:01.667
* Now I'm ready to feel your hand *

01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:08.307
* Lose my heart on the burning sand *

01:43:08.341 --> 01:43:11.577
Come on! Do it, Michigan!

01:43:11.610 --> 01:43:15.147
* Now I want to be your dog *

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.484
* Now I want to be your dog *

01:43:18.517 --> 01:43:21.920
* Now I want to be your dog *

01:43:29.762 --> 01:43:31.430
* Well come on *

01:43:42.207 --> 01:43:44.577
* Now.. *

01:43:45.878 --> 01:43:48.514
I don't want to belong
to the glam people

01:43:48.547 --> 01:43:51.717
I don't want to belong
to the hip, hip-hop people

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:55.621
I don't want to belong
to the, to any of it.

01:43:55.654 --> 01:43:59.558
I don't want to belong
to the TV people...

01:43:59.592 --> 01:44:01.394
...alternative people, none of it.

01:44:01.427 --> 01:44:02.795
I don't want to be a punk.

01:44:02.828 --> 01:44:04.897
I just want to be.
