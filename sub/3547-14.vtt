00:00.083 --> 00:02.291
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.375 --> 00:05.041
<i>Ian's wife, Jane, passed away.</i>

00:05.583 --> 00:07.333
<i>Gabby made a new friend.</i>

00:07.417 --> 00:09.333
A friend friend, not a girlfriend.

00:09.417 --> 00:10.583
<i>The finger of guilt...</i>

00:10.667 --> 00:13.375
- I think it's a phone number.
<i>- ...pointed toward Mike.</i>

00:13.458 --> 00:17.250
They tested my wrench and found
traces of this Monique's blood.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.458
<i>But he still couldn't remember.</i>

00:19.542 --> 00:21.834
<i>Bree found a bag of evidence.</i>

00:21.917 --> 00:23.375
We have to do something.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.333
Not until we put these
back in her house.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.583
<i>Orson had a night...</i>

00:29.208 --> 00:31.500
- What do you want?
- A grandchild.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.083
<i>...that he'd soon rather forget.</i>

00:33.166 --> 00:37.208
- You raped my husband.
- I could be expecting right now.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.458
<i>It had been two months</i>
<i>since Mike Delfino</i>

00:44.542 --> 00:46.667
<i>had awakened from his coma,</i>

00:46.750 --> 00:50.667
<i>and the memories he had lost were</i>
<i>finally starting to return.</i>

00:52.875 --> 00:56.667
<i>He could now recall the first time</i>
<i>he saw Wisteria Lane,</i>

00:59.250 --> 01:02.333
<i>and the first time he met</i>
<i>his new neighbours,</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:08.125
<i>and the first time</i>
<i>he heard Susan Mayer laugh.</i>

01:11.458 --> 01:15.667
<i>But the memory he most</i>
<i>wanted to reclaim still eluded him.</i>

01:16.458 --> 01:19.750
<i>That's why he had gone to see</i>
<i>a hypnotherapist,</i>

01:19.834 --> 01:23.125
<i>so that he could finally</i>
<i>remember everything.</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:33.375
I thought you'd never get here.

01:33.709 --> 01:36.333
I'm sorry. The traffic was terrible.

01:40.542 --> 01:42.291
Sorry about that.

01:43.917 --> 01:46.250
I called my landlord
when the pipe started leaking,

01:46.333 --> 01:48.041
and he recommended you.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.625
I was so flustered,
I couldn't find a piece of paper.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.792
I wrote your number on my hand.

01:52.875 --> 01:56.834
After you finish the sink
maybe you could help me wash it off.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.709
Look,

01:59.375 --> 02:02.041
I'm flattered, but I'm seeing somebody.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.375
Me, too.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.083
But he's married and I'm drunk.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.750
Your S-trap is cracked.

02:13.583 --> 02:16.291
I don't have one with me.
I'll have to go to the hardware store.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.166
- Now? It's late.
- That water is gonna keep seeping,

02:19.250 --> 02:21.333
cause a lot more damage.

02:21.417 --> 02:25.250
- I'll be back in an hour.
- I'll be waiting.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.500
Miss Polier?

02:40.917 --> 02:43.917
I got that part for the sink.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.417
Hello?

02:56.583 --> 02:58.208
What happened, Mike?

02:58.291 --> 03:01.208
- God, I almost had it. I was so close.
- Close to what?

03:01.291 --> 03:05.250
When I went back to Monique's place,
somebody else was there.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.250
- Who?
- I don't know. I couldn't see it.

03:08.542 --> 03:13.166
<i>Yes, there were still many things</i>
<i>Mike Delfino couldn't remember.</i>

03:14.375 --> 03:16.458
Then why are you smiling?

03:16.667 --> 03:21.000
<i>But he'd finally remembered</i>
<i>the most important thing of all.</i>

03:22.667 --> 03:25.333
'Cause now I know I didn't kill her.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.375
<i>It was 6:00 in the morning,</i>

04:13.041 --> 04:15.458
<i>and Bree Hodge</i>
<i>was faced with a dilemma</i>

04:15.542 --> 04:18.125
<i>familiar to countless housewives.</i>

04:19.458 --> 04:22.333
<i>Should she wake her husband</i>
<i>to discuss recent events</i>

04:22.417 --> 04:25.166
<i>that were weighing heavily</i>
<i>on her mind?</i>

04:25.875 --> 04:29.709
<i>Or should she let him continue</i>
<i>to get the rest he needed?</i>

04:30.542 --> 04:33.709
<i>Bree made the obvious choice.</i>

04:36.208 --> 04:40.667
I'm sorry, but you've been out cold
for 10 hours and we need to talk.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.792
I remember drinking the Scotch,

04:44.875 --> 04:47.208
and then Alma suddenly sitting up.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.333
But after that, nothing.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.417
Oh, dear.
I'm not sure how to tell you this,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.875
but after Alma knocked you out,

04:55.792 --> 04:57.583
she assaulted you.

04:58.834 --> 05:01.041
- Where?
- Sexually.

05:02.041 --> 05:04.375
- She had sex with you.
- That's impossible.

05:04.458 --> 05:08.792
Your drink was laced with pills
for erectile dysfunction.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.166
But I was dead to the world.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.625
No, dear, you were dead to the waist.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.542
I had sex with Alma
and I wasn't even conscious?

05:18.208 --> 05:19.917
How reminiscent of our marriage.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This is no joke.

05:22.667 --> 05:25.083
She raped you
and your mother helped.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.542
After we get dressed
we're going to the police.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.250
- I can't do that.
- Orson, I know you're embarrassed,

05:31.959 --> 05:34.250
but what they did to you was a crime.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.709
I can't go to the police.
Not now, not ever.

05:37.792 --> 05:40.625
Orson!
Your ex-wife is a homicidal rapist,

05:40.709 --> 05:43.291
and your mother is
straight out of <i>I, Claudius.</i>

05:43.375 --> 05:45.667
Why do you refuse to deal with them?

05:51.083 --> 05:55.375
I think it's time I told you
about the night Monique Polier died.

06:04.041 --> 06:06.875
- What do you think of this one?
- Pretty sexy.

06:06.959 --> 06:10.375
Is sexy what you're going for
at the funeral of your boyfriend's wife?

06:10.458 --> 06:12.583
You're right. I'll keep looking.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.125
Why are you even going?
Won't it be weird?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.375
No, it'll be fine. Ian wants me there.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.458
Yeah, but it'll be
all of Jane's friends and family,

06:20.542 --> 06:22.500
and you'll be the other woman
who swooped in like some...

06:22.583 --> 06:25.667
Okay, yes.
It'll be weird, but it's not about me.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.834
This is about Jane and Ian.

06:29.291 --> 06:31.458
What if I wear this one?

06:31.542 --> 06:34.625
Then it'll be about Jane,
Ian and your boobs.

06:35.250 --> 06:38.125
I have got to get
more depressing clothes.

06:38.208 --> 06:42.250
Okay, I just need to keep a low profile
through the memorial.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.000
'Cause once I get through this,

06:44.083 --> 06:46.542
Ian can officially introduce me
as his girlfriend,

06:46.625 --> 06:50.125
and we'll finally be a normal,
non-adulterous couple.

06:51.208 --> 06:54.208
- What does this one say to you?
- Modest, reserved

06:54.291 --> 06:57.667
and definitely not dating
the dead lady's husband.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.458
Sold.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.709
I'm not gonna get you towels
for your birthday.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.333
Let's go to the jewellery department.

07:04.417 --> 07:08.166
No, Zach. I only accept jewellery
from men I plan on sleeping with.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.041
Well, okay,
so where does that leave me?

07:12.250 --> 07:15.000
You can buy me that toilet seat cover.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.000
Fine. All right, we're just friends.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.625
Can I at least take you out
for a birthday dinner?

07:20.709 --> 07:24.000
There will be no celebration.
I'm turning 31.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.250
I'm a single woman in her thirties.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.792
I now have to subscribe to <i>Cat Fancy.</i>

07:28.875 --> 07:30.291
It's the law.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.417
Age is just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.250
It means something to me.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.333
Being alone at this age, it's hard,

07:37.417 --> 07:40.750
and it's only gonna get harder.
I'm so depressed.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.792
Let me buy you a car.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.333
No, thanks.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.458
But I do need a liquid soap dispenser.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.542
Go.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.458
Hello.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.208
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to disturb you.

08:15.291 --> 08:16.583
I was just trying to see whether or not

08:16.667 --> 08:19.417
this was a regular king
or a California king.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.250
I think it's a regular.
California kings are much longer.

08:24.250 --> 08:27.041
Is your wife particularly tall?

08:27.917 --> 08:29.750
Oh, I'm not married.

08:31.250 --> 08:35.417
- Why don't you try it out?
- It's okay. I can wait until you get off.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.000
That'll happen a lot faster
if you just hop on board.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.709
I'm sorry?

08:41.834 --> 08:44.083
It was a shameless sex joke.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.417
I was flirting with you.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.375
Oh! Right.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.792
Sorry, I can be a little dense.

08:52.667 --> 08:56.291
- Can we start over?
- No. Moment's gone. You killed it.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.375
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry,

08:58.458 --> 09:01.417
but maybe we can
try this again sometime.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.834
It could happen.

09:04.917 --> 09:07.125
Hey, sorry it took so long.

09:07.625 --> 09:11.500
- Mr Young?
- Oh, you know my friend Zach?

09:12.709 --> 09:13.917
No, I don't think so.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.208
I'm Luke. Purdue.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.166
I'm on your legal team.
I'm taking point on the Halverson deal.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.000
Yeah, right. Hey.

09:22.959 --> 09:25.375
Again, it was nice meeting you.

09:26.625 --> 09:27.792
Sir.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.291
That was really weird.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.500
I don't even know the guy
and he works for me.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.834
Works for me, too.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.917
- Bree.
- Please don't touch me.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.625
All this time you've said
you wanted the truth.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.041
That's before I knew what it was.

09:51.125 --> 09:54.083
You see, that's why I've tried to
protect you from this.

09:54.166 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, but you weren't just trying to
protect me, were you?

09:59.583 --> 10:02.583
- What do you want me to do?
- Exonerate Mike.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.041
How could you stand by
and let an innocent man

10:06.125 --> 10:08.667
- be dragged off to prison?
- You think I haven't felt terrible?

10:08.750 --> 10:13.208
And this after he'd been in a coma
because some lunatic ran him over.

10:14.208 --> 10:17.291
He has had a rough year.
I want to help Mike.

10:17.667 --> 10:21.750
How do I do that without
implicating myself? I could go to jail.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.583
I don't care if you go to jail.

10:23.667 --> 10:27.667
You have done a horrible thing
and you have to make it right.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.709
I mean it, Orson.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.709
If you don't fix this, I will.

10:34.542 --> 10:37.208
Well, I guess
I'm in no position to argue.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.500
No, you're not.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.875
- Morning, Andrew.
- Hey, Orson.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.709
I was just gonna ask if you guys
wanted some coffee.

10:49.792 --> 10:52.458
Oh, yeah, thanks. I could use some.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.125
It's gonna be a long day.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.667
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.208
Thank you.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.166
Mom!

11:09.333 --> 11:12.208
Dinner is in an hour.
You know the rules.

11:12.583 --> 11:13.667
And so do you.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.542
I know, I know,
but he gave me the face.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.750
You fell for the face.
What are you, a rookie?

11:19.834 --> 11:23.375
Okay, you're right. Sorry, buddy.
Mom's the boss.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.542
I feel nothing.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.542
Hi, Lynette. Hey, Tom.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.500
How's the restaurant coming?
You ready for the big opening?

11:36.583 --> 11:39.375
Oh, we're getting there.
Let me give you a coupon.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.583
Free extra topping
on any medium or large.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.000
How nice.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.625
But you know
what would be even nicer?

11:46.667 --> 11:49.125
Hire my nephew to work for you.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.709
You know, the coupon's good all week.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.875
Look, I don't know what lies
you've heard about Austin.

11:53.959 --> 11:56.583
But you can't be listening
to vicious gossip.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.250
I heard he got arrested
for beating some guy up.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.792
Okay, that one's pretty accurate.

12:00.875 --> 12:04.875
- Edie, I'm all staffed up.
- Oh, come on, help me out.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.375
Seriously.
Ever since Julie dumped him

12:07.458 --> 12:08.792
he's been depressed and mopey.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.500
He's driving me crazy. Please!
Any crappy job you got.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.917
Well, I guess I could use
an extra guy in back.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.542
Have him there tomorrow,
8:00 in the morning.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.250
Thank you. Thank you so, so much.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.208
Edie, you forgot your coupon.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.667
Tom, please.

12:26.750 --> 12:31.291
You've checked out my butt enough
times to know that I don't eat pizza.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.709
- Zach.
- I know.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.792
You said you wanted to be alone
for your birthday,

12:46.875 --> 12:48.125
but that's just dumb.

12:48.208 --> 12:51.166
- So I'm gonna take you out.
- Oh, that's so sweet, but I...

12:51.250 --> 12:54.125
Don't worry. It's gonna be one friend
keeping another friend company.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.625
It's not gonna be a date.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.333
Well, Luke's gonna be here
in 20 minutes,

12:58.417 --> 13:00.834
and that kind of will be a date.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.542
Luke?

13:03.834 --> 13:05.709
- My lawyer guy?
- Yeah.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.291
That isn't a problem, is it?

13:08.375 --> 13:12.375
'Cause this is what friends do,
they talk about each other's dates.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.000
No, I'm cool.

13:14.583 --> 13:18.542
Have a great time.
I'm gonna get out of your hair.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.625
So you think this guy's really into you?

13:24.709 --> 13:27.667
Well, he seemed to like me
in the mattress department,

13:27.750 --> 13:31.375
so here's hoping I like him
in the mattress department.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.625
What? Friends say these things.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.917
Orson.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.208
Oh, well, I'm in luck.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.917
The whole coven's here.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.417
I just stopped by to say thank you.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.208
You're welcome.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.875
I bought a pregnancy test,
but it's too soon to take it.

13:57.959 --> 13:59.709
I wasn't talking about the sex,

13:59.792 --> 14:03.041
though hat's off, Mother,
for colluding in my rape.

14:03.125 --> 14:06.625
I think it's great that we can
still surprise each other.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.291
No, I was talking more about
what you did for me and Bree.

14:09.375 --> 14:10.709
What did I do?

14:10.792 --> 14:15.208
Your little stunt made her so angry
she demanded we go to the police.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.375
She forced my hand.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.291
- So I told her everything.
- Everything?

14:22.417 --> 14:24.375
That is rather unwise.

14:24.458 --> 14:28.500
I faced my worst fear, the moment
I felt sure would end my marriage.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.583
And guess what? It didn't.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.542
- She forgave you?
- Not entirely.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.792
Not yet. But she'll come around.

14:40.083 --> 14:44.208
The good news is the months of dread,
the fear of discovery,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.709
that's all over.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.917
So thank you.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.542
And goodbye.

14:55.583 --> 14:58.333
Wait! I could be carrying your child.

14:59.417 --> 15:03.041
I don't care if you've got
the Hodge septuplets in there.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.125
I'm sticking with Bree.

15:11.709 --> 15:15.041
Why must he make everything
so difficult?

15:20.583 --> 15:22.125
Floor's done.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.583
I told you I wanted this floor
to sparkle like your mom's.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.959
Now, does this floor look
Bree Hodge clean to you?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.667
No. Looks Andrew Van De Kamp clean.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.458
But your disappointment in me
is very Bree Hodge.

15:37.709 --> 15:41.542
Okay, just for that, you get to help me
take out the trash.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.917
I know you think I'm being a hardass,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.792
but I'm just looking for
a basic level of professionalism.

15:52.917 --> 15:55.709
Austin? What the hell's going on here?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.583
Just talking to the delivery guy.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.542
Hey, where'd he go?

16:02.417 --> 16:03.959
Are you high?

16:04.333 --> 16:05.625
Only...

16:07.959 --> 16:09.291
Totally.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.000
- Austin!
- Dude, not smart.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.959
But I have good reason
and when you hear it

16:15.041 --> 16:18.250
you're not gonna
make that face any more.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.375
Julie Mayer dumped me

16:21.458 --> 16:25.667
and I'm very, very upset.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.083
Your face is not changing.

16:30.875 --> 16:35.375
Get your stuff, get the hell out of
my restaurant. You're fired. Go on.

16:41.542 --> 16:45.041
The floor's looking
pretty clean right now, isn't it?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.959
You said he'd come back to me.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.000
You said deep down he still loves me.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.041
Well, you heard him today,
he hates me.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.250
You ravished him against his will.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.250
He's bound to be touchy
in the short run.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.000
I'll handle Orson,
you just worry about the baby.

17:04.083 --> 17:07.583
- He said he doesn't care.
- He says that now,

17:07.667 --> 17:10.709
but he will not abandon
his own flesh and blood.

17:10.792 --> 17:14.375
You're his flesh and blood.
He put you in a home.

17:15.917 --> 17:19.500
You know, I usually don't say this
to expectant mothers,

17:19.583 --> 17:22.375
but for God's sake, have a Scotch.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.375
I should just call the police.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.959
- What?
- I know what he did.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.041
If he's never gonna love me,
why should I protect him?

17:35.125 --> 17:38.291
I'd rather see him in jail than
playing house with Tammy Tight-ass.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.208
Knock it off, Alma.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.500
I will make Orson come around.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.083
I don't believe you any more.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.709
She's got her claws in him
and she's not letting go.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.667
Don't be so sure.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.667
I was looking over at their house
last night,

17:55.750 --> 17:57.542
and I saw something

17:57.959 --> 18:00.959
very curious.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.375
What?

18:04.542 --> 18:06.750
You can't see it down here.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.041
We need to be up higher.

18:22.709 --> 18:26.750
How can you see anything from here?
There's not even a window.

18:28.583 --> 18:29.875
Gloria?

18:32.333 --> 18:33.625
Gloria!

18:34.333 --> 18:36.917
Just calm down, sweetheart.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.667
- Gloria, let me out!
- Stress isn't good for the baby.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.000
What are you doing? Hey!

18:42.834 --> 18:44.125
Gloria!

19:05.667 --> 19:09.458
- So how are you holding up?
- Better, now that you're here.

19:09.709 --> 19:12.583
No, I want to keep a low profile.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.417
I've kissed a hundred lips today.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.792
I assure you, it would look
more conspicuous if I didn't.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.750
Okay, that's enough.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.250
Ian, you must be shattered.

19:33.333 --> 19:36.083
- I know I am.
- Thanks for coming, Lynn.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.583
You know,
Jane used to kid me about you.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.041
- Did she?
- She'd say,

19:45.125 --> 19:49.667
"Lynn, if anything ever happens to me,
I want you to marry Ian.

19:50.917 --> 19:54.875
"You're pushy. Maybe you could
get him to pick up his socks."

19:57.583 --> 20:01.458
Listen, if you ever need to talk,
I'm here.

20:02.625 --> 20:06.458
Why don't you stop over some night
for a home-cooked meal?

20:08.125 --> 20:12.542
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I wouldn't dream of putting you out.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.959
Well, I won't take no for an answer.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.041
Have you got my number?

20:18.125 --> 20:19.917
I sure as hell do.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.291
Well, I'm sure I'll find it
in Jane's phone book.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.000
Let me give it to you, just in case.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.083
Call any time.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.000
Watch yourself.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.375
So I was there on a plumbing job.

20:46.458 --> 20:49.625
It makes complete sense.
I had no reason to want her dead.

20:49.709 --> 20:53.625
I always thought hypnotherapy
was a bunch of bull, but damn.

20:54.291 --> 20:57.208
This is huge, man.
You didn't kill anyone.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.333
The murderer has to be
this yellow gloves guy.

21:00.417 --> 21:03.917
Yeah, but no matter how much I
concentrate, I still can't see a face.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.667
You will. Look at the progress
that you've made so far.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.750
You're gonna find this guy,

21:09.834 --> 21:12.417
and then you're gonna hand his ass
over to the cops.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.959
Yeah. Something like that.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.834
Hey, guys.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.792
Well, Ian seems to be holding up.

21:30.875 --> 21:33.792
It's just a mask. The man is devastated.

21:34.208 --> 21:38.125
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna swing by
his place to offer him a casserole

21:38.208 --> 21:40.291
and a shoulder to cry on.

21:40.875 --> 21:45.041
Will that shoulder be wearing
a spaghetti strap and Chanel No. 5?

21:45.166 --> 21:47.000
You know me so well.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.917
Look at him. Even in mourning
the man is scrumptious.

21:54.417 --> 21:55.834
I'm sorry for eavesdropping,

21:55.917 --> 21:59.542
but don't you think your conversation
is a little inappropriate?

21:59.625 --> 22:02.542
I mean, we're here to grieve, not cruise.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.208
I'm sorry, and you are...

22:06.625 --> 22:08.125
Susan Mayer.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.333
I'm a friend of the family.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.583
Then you know how lonely Ian's been.

22:17.041 --> 22:19.709
And if I want to
do something about that,

22:19.792 --> 22:22.000
it's no business of yours.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.083
Look, just to save you
the embarrassment,

22:28.166 --> 22:30.083
Ian's seeing someone.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.000
Who?

22:34.709 --> 22:36.250
I'm not at liberty to say.

22:36.333 --> 22:39.750
Under the circumstances,
they'd prefer to keep it quiet.

22:39.834 --> 22:42.291
I don't believe it.
If there was some bimbo in the picture,

22:42.375 --> 22:43.625
I'd have heard about it.

22:43.709 --> 22:46.583
As far as I'm concerned, he's free meat.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.291
Okay, it's me.

22:50.542 --> 22:53.417
- What?
- I'm the bimbo. He's my meat.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.667
All righty.
I just wanted to clear that up.

23:02.875 --> 23:07.166
And now I'm going to go find myself
a seat with a better view.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.166
Here are your W-4s.

23:12.250 --> 23:15.291
Please sign them and get them back
to me as soon as possible.

23:15.375 --> 23:18.750
Also, I'm gonna need a copy... Hi.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.792
Of your driver's license.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.417
- Austin?
- Yeah.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.125
What are you doing here? I fired you.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.000
Well, Mr Scavo gave me my job back.

23:29.125 --> 23:30.291
Hey!

23:31.625 --> 23:35.917
You hired him back? Did he tell you
he was stoned on the job?

23:36.250 --> 23:39.000
Yeah, and he knows if he does it again
he is out of here.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.166
Look, I don't know what kind of hustle
you pulled on him,

23:41.250 --> 23:42.542
but it's not gonna work on me.

23:42.625 --> 23:45.083
- Lynette.
- No. I fired him.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.834
And you are gonna stay fired.

23:46.917 --> 23:49.875
Honey, can I see you in the back
for a sec?

23:55.542 --> 23:56.583
What the hell are you doing,

23:56.667 --> 23:58.458
talking to me like that
in front of my staff?

23:58.542 --> 24:01.166
Well, I'm sorry,
but you totally blindsided me out there.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.834
No, I was the one who was blindsided.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.375
You just went off on me
without hearing what my reasons were.

24:05.458 --> 24:06.792
Well, I'm sorry, let's hear them.

24:06.875 --> 24:09.000
What are your reasons
for bringing back Joe Bong-Hit?

24:09.083 --> 24:10.125
I'll tell you,

24:10.208 --> 24:13.458
if you drop that tone
and stop making that face.

24:13.625 --> 24:15.000
What is...

24:15.333 --> 24:17.542
This was a business decision.

24:17.625 --> 24:18.667
In case you hadn't noticed,

24:18.750 --> 24:22.667
and I hadn't until the waitresses
pointed it out to me, Austin is hot.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.667
He's gonna bring in every girl
from Fairview High

24:24.750 --> 24:26.291
and half the boys in the chorus.

24:26.375 --> 24:29.125
What's more,
Edie is gonna include our menu

24:29.208 --> 24:31.542
in the welcome packet
she gives to new homeowners.

24:31.625 --> 24:35.458
I'm not sure she'd feel so generous
if we fired her nephew.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.083
- Those reasons working for you?
- Yeah.

24:40.166 --> 24:43.041
I just wish you'd told me
before you rehired him.

24:43.125 --> 24:45.208
I mean, I am the manager.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.834
Right.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.041
But I'm the boss.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.208
Well, kind of.

24:52.542 --> 24:55.625
No, no, not "kind of." Really.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.250
I'm the boss.

24:59.792 --> 25:01.291
You're pulling rank on me?

25:01.375 --> 25:04.333
Look, at home, you get to be in charge.

25:04.417 --> 25:08.166
You decide how we discipline the boys,
what car we buy, everything.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.375
I consult you.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.875
Oh, sure!
And if you disagree, you ignore me.

25:11.959 --> 25:16.000
Look, when I go home, basically,
I check my balls at the door.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.792
And that's fine. It works.

25:17.875 --> 25:20.959
But for this to work,
when you walk through that door,

25:21.041 --> 25:23.000
you gotta check yours.

25:28.417 --> 25:29.625
Okay.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.250
Really?

25:33.041 --> 25:35.750
Really. This place is your dream,

25:35.834 --> 25:38.875
so consider them checked.

25:39.959 --> 25:43.333
Thanks. Now I need you to do
just one more thing.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.709
Whatever you say, boss.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.583
I don't care if you think
you know what's best.

25:49.667 --> 25:52.417
You don't, I do, because I'm the boss,

25:52.500 --> 25:55.291
- and what I say goes.
- Yeah, that's it. Give it to me.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.625
So when I make a decision
it stays made. You got that, Lynette?

25:58.709 --> 26:01.500
- Yes, sir. Okay, that's enough.
- Just one more.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.041
And if I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!

26:04.125 --> 26:06.041
But I probably won't,

26:06.125 --> 26:08.750
because I'm the boss. Are we clear?

26:09.250 --> 26:11.041
Seriously, stop or I will hurt you.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.083
Okay, I made my point.

26:13.625 --> 26:17.291
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in the back, drinking a beer.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.500
This is delicious.

26:34.583 --> 26:38.250
Don't get too full.
You have to leave room for dessert.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.834
Oh? What are we having?

26:40.917 --> 26:43.333
Well, let's just say
it's going to be served upstairs

26:43.417 --> 26:45.625
and involves whipped cream.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.041
Is it pudding?

26:48.333 --> 26:49.667
No.

26:50.291 --> 26:53.834
Oh, you're flirting.
Do it again, I swear I'll get it.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.208
That's okay. Do you want some coffee?

26:56.291 --> 26:58.208
You bet I want coffee.

26:58.583 --> 27:00.792
Nice and hot.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.834
Just finish your soup
and we'll get naked.

27:10.542 --> 27:14.625
Sorry to bother you, Mrs Solis.
I work with Luke. Is he available?

27:14.709 --> 27:17.250
Charles? What are you doing here?

27:17.333 --> 27:19.959
You forgot to initial some pages
on the Halverson contract.

27:20.041 --> 27:23.375
- Can't this wait?
- Market's already open in Tokyo.

27:24.250 --> 27:27.041
Go ahead.
I'm gonna open some more wine.

27:39.542 --> 27:43.166
Mr Young wants to make sure
you understand that last part.

27:43.250 --> 27:44.500
Do you?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.709
Yeah.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.166
I get it.

28:01.083 --> 28:03.208
So when we think of Jane,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.375
let us remember her kind heart

28:06.500 --> 28:08.000
and her loving spirit.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.041
And now, if there's someone
who would like to share

28:10.125 --> 28:12.542
a special memory of our dear friend.

28:12.625 --> 28:13.917
I would.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.542
Hi, I'm Lynn Dean.

28:23.959 --> 28:26.458
Jane and I were sorority sisters.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.750
If she were here, she'd make me
sing our pledge song,

28:29.834 --> 28:33.625
but I think there's already been
enough grief for one day.

28:35.375 --> 28:39.959
Now, I know how badly
we've all felt for Ian

28:40.542 --> 28:43.500
during his long, lonely vigil.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.417
So I'm sure you'll be as happy
as I was to learn

28:49.250 --> 28:52.250
his vigil wasn't
quite so lonely after all.

28:53.458 --> 28:54.917
Oh, dear God.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.667
No, he found a warm, caring woman

28:59.959 --> 29:01.750
to share his burden

29:03.500 --> 29:05.208
and so much else.

29:10.208 --> 29:14.542
Some people might find the fact
that she's here today inappropriate,

29:15.125 --> 29:17.834
but I think she's a hero.

29:19.083 --> 29:22.458
She dared to brave the scorn

29:22.542 --> 29:26.917
of those who might find her
actions questionable

29:27.000 --> 29:30.125
or even unsavoury.

29:30.208 --> 29:32.834
Oh, I was gonna ask her to stand,

29:32.917 --> 29:35.041
but I see she already has.

29:36.917 --> 29:39.625
Susan Mayer, say hello.

29:42.625 --> 29:43.750
Hey.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.083
Wow.

29:54.917 --> 29:57.917
Guess someone's in a hurry
to get on with the evening.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.208
Yeah.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.125
Well, I should go.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.083
- What?
- I have a lot more work to do

30:05.166 --> 30:07.166
on that Halverson deal.

30:08.041 --> 30:11.166
- Sorry.
- But can't it wait till after dessert?

30:11.250 --> 30:13.250
And by dessert I mean sex.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.458
- You are clear on that, right?
- Painfully.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.041
My job's at stake here.
I really don't have much of a choice.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.709
Oh, I think you've got lots of choices.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.542
Here's one of them.

30:31.750 --> 30:34.542
- Hello?
- What do you think you're doing?

30:34.875 --> 30:36.375
- What?
<i>- I gave you an order</i>

30:36.458 --> 30:39.917
and I expect you to follow it.
Now, get out of there.

30:40.208 --> 30:42.750
<i>I'm trying, sir. It's just that</i>
<i>I'm meeting some resistance</i>

30:42.834 --> 30:44.709
<i>to the plan we've agreed on.</i>

30:44.792 --> 30:47.542
Okay, she's not letting you leave?
That's fine.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.959
Here's what I want you to say.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.500
Okay, I'll give it a shot, sir.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.166
- Is that your office?
- Yeah, they...

30:57.792 --> 30:59.375
They really need me over there.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.792
Okay, so come back when you're done.
I'll wait up.

31:03.208 --> 31:05.792
I can't. No, I really can't.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.875
What is with you?

31:10.959 --> 31:13.000
An hour ago you were really into me,

31:13.083 --> 31:14.792
and now you can't get out fast enough!

31:14.875 --> 31:16.333
Okay, truth?

31:18.333 --> 31:20.417
I thought I could do this, but I can't.

31:21.917 --> 31:24.250
I'm just not attracted to you.

31:25.041 --> 31:27.375
- Of course you are!
- No, see...

31:28.625 --> 31:31.250
I really only date
women in their twenties.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.875
- What?
- Sorry.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.959
You're too old for me.

31:42.750 --> 31:46.208
I still got a lot of kick
for an old broad, don't I?

32:29.709 --> 32:30.917
Mom?

32:32.834 --> 32:35.083
Mom! Mom, are you all right?

32:35.291 --> 32:38.583
Don't move her.
She might have broken something.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Yes, we need an ambulance, please,
at 4354 Wisteria Lane.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.875
My wife's had a bad fall. Please hurry.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.458
What the hell is this?

33:04.041 --> 33:07.792
Mrs Hodge was very lucky.
She only suffered a slight concussion.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.917
If you have any more questions
the doctor should be back soon.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.375
Thank you.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.000
Thank God. I was so worried.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.166
Yeah, I'll bet.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.583
What's that supposed to mean?

33:23.792 --> 33:25.667
I heard you two yesterday.

33:25.750 --> 33:28.917
All that stuff about you
maybe going to jail.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.417
Well, that's none of your business,

33:31.500 --> 33:35.375
but if you think I had anything to do
with Bree falling...

33:35.458 --> 33:36.709
I'm not stupid.

33:36.792 --> 33:40.000
I know the cops have been all over you
about that dead woman.

33:40.083 --> 33:42.500
And Mom said for you to fix it
or she would.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.834
Is this accident how you fixed it?

33:44.917 --> 33:47.709
- All right, you're upset, I get it...
- No, no, you don't get it.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.125
There's a reason my mom
put me out on the street last year.

33:50.208 --> 33:53.834
You've never met that guy.
You've never met Bad Andrew.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.875
But hurt my mom, and you will.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.875
I love your mother.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.375
I'm gonna do everything
I can to protect her.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.709
Yeah, so am I.

34:09.166 --> 34:11.250
Hi, I'm Bree Hodge's son.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.959
You see that guy right there?
That's her husband.

34:15.041 --> 34:18.125
Do not, under any circumstances,
let him be alone with her.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.000
- Why?
- Because it's his fault

34:20.083 --> 34:21.375
that she's in here.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.375
He's a dangerous guy.
Now, I've warned you.

34:23.458 --> 34:26.208
If anything happens to her,
you're liable.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.458
Good night, Dad.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.917
Oh, you're home.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.917
I thought you'd still be out on your date.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.917
Date's over. What do you want?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.625
I thought since I can't take you out
for your birthday,

34:54.709 --> 34:57.208
I'd at least leave you a present.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.417
Don't worry, it's not expensive.

35:04.959 --> 35:07.208
Oh, Zach!

35:09.750 --> 35:11.583
So how'd your date go?

35:12.125 --> 35:14.375
Is he crazy? You're not old.

35:16.250 --> 35:19.959
You did not see the look on his face
when I tried to kiss him.

35:20.041 --> 35:22.959
It was like he was sniffing expired milk.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.750
That's ridiculous. You're gorgeous.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.041
And you're just gonna get prettier
every year.

35:29.125 --> 35:33.041
That's so sweet, but it's a lie.

35:34.291 --> 35:37.417
Every tick of the clock
takes away something.

35:39.375 --> 35:42.917
Zach, what am I gonna do
when I'm not pretty any more?

35:45.917 --> 35:48.000
It's never gonna happen.

35:49.750 --> 35:53.291
I'm gonna take a little nap, okay?
Just for a minute.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.542
Take as long as you'd like.

36:10.333 --> 36:13.625
Susan, I've looked everywhere for you.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.750
I didn't think to start with the

36:17.583 --> 36:19.166
embalming room.

36:19.917 --> 36:23.083
Yeah, I'll be having night terrors
from now on,

36:23.917 --> 36:25.709
which I deserve.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.291
Look, no one is judging you.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.333
If anything,
they're judging that dreadful Lynn.

36:32.417 --> 36:35.000
I should be thanking you
for driving her away.

36:35.083 --> 36:37.959
Usually takes a crucifix
and some garlic.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.959
I'm so sorry I ruined Jane's funeral.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.458
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

36:46.542 --> 36:49.166
- It's just...
- What?

36:51.583 --> 36:55.834
I thought after we got through this
really painful day,

36:56.166 --> 36:58.709
things would start to get better.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.709
I thought I could be
more a part of your world.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.417
Now all your friends and family
are just gonna think of me

37:07.500 --> 37:10.291
as the crazy lady from Jane's funeral.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.875
Oh, God. Oh, Ian, okay.

37:13.959 --> 37:15.458
This is not supposed to be about me.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.458
You should be upstairs

37:17.750 --> 37:19.333
to say goodbye.

37:21.500 --> 37:26.166
I'm just gonna hide out here with the
departed until everybody leaves.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.125
No.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.792
No more hiding.
We've been doing it far too long.

37:35.291 --> 37:37.667
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.166
You helped me through
the most difficult part of my life.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.792
I love you. I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

37:42.875 --> 37:44.750
I want to marry you.

37:46.125 --> 37:48.417
Ian, are you proposing to me?

37:49.792 --> 37:52.583
Well, I guess, maybe, I...

37:52.959 --> 37:54.750
- I am.
- Well...

37:55.542 --> 37:57.667
Before you say another word,

37:57.750 --> 37:59.542
take a look around.

38:01.875 --> 38:03.083
Right.

38:03.709 --> 38:05.500
I hadn't really thought a lot
about this moment,

38:05.583 --> 38:09.917
but when I did, the table we were at
didn't have a blood gutter.

38:11.458 --> 38:15.667
Then may I reopen the subject
at a more opportune time and place?

38:18.834 --> 38:19.959
Yes.

38:22.417 --> 38:26.291
I accept your proposal to propose.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.375
Shall we?

38:38.792 --> 38:40.959
Now I want you to dig deep.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.917
If you feel your memory blocked,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.583
just count to three
and the block will melt away.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.458
It is natural and easy
for you to recall anything.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.500
Now remember Monique Polier.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.667
Remember the night you met her...

39:01.875 --> 39:03.417
Miss Polier?

39:05.125 --> 39:07.875
I've got that part for the sink.

39:09.792 --> 39:11.000
Hello?

39:22.250 --> 39:25.750
Sorry. Monique's upstairs taking a nap.

39:26.083 --> 39:28.125
She wasn't feeling well.

39:34.166 --> 39:36.417
Mike? Did you see something?

39:41.166 --> 39:42.917
I'm her boyfriend.

39:43.417 --> 39:46.834
I figured she'd want to wake up
to a clean kitchen.

39:47.834 --> 39:51.959
Well, I'll just finish up with the sink
and be out of your hair.

39:52.083 --> 39:55.041
Why don't you let me
take care of the sink?

39:55.291 --> 39:58.458
I mean, I'm pretty handy
and it's getting late.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.291
I don't mind staying.

40:00.375 --> 40:03.375
No, look, it's okay.
I got it under control.

40:03.834 --> 40:07.375
Here. This should cover
what we owe you.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.125
Tell Miss Polier I hope she feels better.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.542
Will do.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.333
Oh, hey.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.667
Don't forget your wrench.

40:29.542 --> 40:31.667
Mike, where are you going?

40:31.750 --> 40:32.917
Mike!

40:40.834 --> 40:42.583
Hey, Mr Delfino.

40:42.667 --> 40:45.041
I need to talk to your stepdad.

40:45.125 --> 40:48.709
Orson's not here.
He went to the hospital with my mom.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.917
She's fine. Thanks for asking.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.792
Mr Hodge.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.542
Your wife's just sleeping.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.959
I suggest you go home
and do the same.

41:06.583 --> 41:07.834
I will.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.458
You okay?

41:12.041 --> 41:13.917
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.625
It's...

41:18.500 --> 41:21.458
There was a time
when we were all so happy.

41:21.667 --> 41:24.583
I just can't seem to
remember it any more.

41:25.375 --> 41:28.709
<i>Recapturing the past</i>
<i>is a tricky business.</i>

41:29.417 --> 41:33.333
<i>While most memories are simply</i>
<i>souvenirs of a happier time...</i>

41:33.709 --> 41:35.041
Hey, there.

41:35.125 --> 41:38.500
<i>...others can be quite deadly.</i>

41:39.792 --> 41:43.208
Hey, Mike.
What brings you to the hospital?

41:44.083 --> 41:46.625
I've been seeing a hypnotherapist.

41:47.542 --> 41:50.542
She's helping me fill the gaps
in my memory.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.750
How's it going?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.000
It's working.
