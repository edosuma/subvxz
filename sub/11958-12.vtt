00:02.301 --> 00:08.180
<i>Harold, have you wondered
how we got to this place?</i>

00:08.205 --> 00:10.824
Afraid I'm all too well aware.

00:10.849 --> 00:13.557
<i>You seem very calm,
considering you commandeered</i>

00:13.582 --> 00:16.210
<i>the world's most lethal virus.</i>

00:16.379 --> 00:19.249
<i>I assume you've given
thought to the ramifications</i>

00:19.274 --> 00:20.916
<i>of what you're about to do.</i>

00:20.941 --> 00:23.070
Of course I have.

00:23.095 --> 00:26.844
But it's the only way to stop Samaritan.

00:26.869 --> 00:29.698
<i>I sense a tone of regret in your voice.</i>

00:29.723 --> 00:31.182
Call it responsibility

00:31.207 --> 00:33.666
for the situation I've
put our friends in.

00:33.691 --> 00:35.841
<i>They've always been aware of the risk,
Harold.</i>

00:35.866 --> 00:37.121
But it started with me.

00:37.146 --> 00:38.845
<i>Yes.</i>

00:38.870 --> 00:40.709
<i>When you created me,</i>

00:40.734 --> 00:42.353
<i>your machine.</i>

00:42.378 --> 00:44.861
<i>Is that what you regret?</i>

00:44.886 --> 00:47.965
<i>It's understandable for
you to ask the question,</i>

00:48.290 --> 00:49.749
<i>"What if?"</i>

00:49.774 --> 00:52.233
It's pointless, I'm sure.

00:52.258 --> 00:53.992
<i>Is it?</i>

00:54.017 --> 00:56.926
<i>I can tell you with a
fair amount of certainty,</i>

00:57.200 --> 00:59.409
<i>the world would have been
a very different place</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:03.000
<i>had I never existed.</i>

01:03.138 --> 01:05.940
Harold, I knew you
would come, my friend.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.964
Ah!

01:07.989 --> 01:10.118
He's building the Machine
for one U.S. dollar.

01:10.143 --> 01:11.676
Something happened this morning.

01:11.701 --> 01:13.950
If we don't change the world,
someone else will.

01:13.975 --> 01:16.151
_

01:16.176 --> 01:19.751
_

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.282 --> 01:33.991
Got anything stronger?

01:34.016 --> 01:35.654
Nathan.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.865
Welcome back.

01:36.890 --> 01:39.201
So how did you fare in
our nation's capital?

01:39.226 --> 01:40.664
You tell me.

01:40.689 --> 01:42.982
The government wants to
extend us another five years.

01:43.007 --> 01:45.771
Those contracts are worth
nearly $1/2 billion.

01:45.796 --> 01:47.684
Suppose that means I
need to get back to work.

01:49.262 --> 01:52.891
You do realize technically that
neither us need to work anymore.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.741
I think that deserves a toast.

02:01.323 --> 02:02.643
To achieving the dream.

02:10.842 --> 02:14.199
Did you ever think we'd make it
this far when we started out?

02:14.224 --> 02:16.019
I wasn't sure we'd make it at all.

02:16.044 --> 02:17.987
Any regrets?

02:18.012 --> 02:20.493
Oh...

02:20.763 --> 02:22.497
Sometimes I wonder if
we couldn't have done

02:22.522 --> 02:24.448
something more...

02:24.473 --> 02:26.302
meaningful.

02:26.327 --> 02:28.703
You mean the DoD project.

02:28.728 --> 02:30.779
Harold, that's ancient history.

02:30.803 --> 02:33.198
I know, but I sometimes think
if we'd have kept trying,

02:33.223 --> 02:34.774
maybe it would have worked.

02:34.799 --> 02:37.009
Maybe we'd have stopped
those other attacks.

02:37.034 --> 02:39.663
Or the attacks might
have happened regardless.

02:39.688 --> 02:41.731
We made a choice that was right for us.

02:41.756 --> 02:42.706
And you can bet

02:42.731 --> 02:44.345
if the government wants
a system like that,

02:44.370 --> 02:46.293
they'll have it someday,

02:46.564 --> 02:48.355
if they don't have it already.

02:50.163 --> 02:52.018
And we dodged a bullet

02:52.043 --> 02:54.406
not getting in bed with
those CIA bastards.

02:54.431 --> 02:56.300
If anything had went wrong,

02:56.422 --> 02:58.392
we'd have taken the fall for it.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.417
You're right, I'm sure.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.076
Well, I really do need
to get back to work now.

03:03.101 --> 03:05.770
So... hey, so are you
good for dinner tomorrow?

03:05.929 --> 03:07.338
Because, you know, Olivia invited

03:07.363 --> 03:09.158
that friend of hers I told you about.

03:09.183 --> 03:10.707
I'm afraid I can't make it.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.862
Harold, there's more
to life than just work.

03:14.887 --> 03:16.498
Much more.

03:16.523 --> 03:19.365
I really do appreciate
your efforts, Nathan.

03:19.391 --> 03:21.298
But I feel like if it was meant to be,

03:21.323 --> 03:23.322
it would've already happened.

03:23.506 --> 03:25.966
I just want you to be happy, my friend.

03:25.991 --> 03:27.990
And I am.

03:38.076 --> 03:40.255
So Nathan would have lived.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.179
<i>Yes. And you were never injured.</i>

03:43.204 --> 03:46.516
But... Grace?

03:46.541 --> 03:49.238
<i>Given the laws of probability,</i>

03:49.263 --> 03:51.598
<i>you would have never met her.</i>

03:54.092 --> 03:55.708
What else?

03:55.734 --> 03:57.485
<i>I think that'll have to wait.</i>

03:57.510 --> 04:00.034
Hey, who the hell are you?

04:00.059 --> 04:01.457
What are you doing in my house?

04:01.482 --> 04:02.834
Lower your voice, Mr. Barnett.

04:02.859 --> 04:04.648
You'll wake your wife and daughter.

04:04.673 --> 04:07.617
The combination on your
gun safe has been changed,

04:07.642 --> 04:10.311
and your home alarm system is disabled.

04:10.461 --> 04:13.380
You're welcome to retreat
into your panic room.

04:13.405 --> 04:14.782
I'll be done shortly.

04:14.807 --> 04:17.363
I'd advise against
contacting the authorities.

04:17.387 --> 04:20.668
Unless you want the FBI
to learn about Seltene.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.408
What did you say?

04:22.433 --> 04:24.101
The restaurant in Bern

04:24.126 --> 04:26.644
where you sold members of Russia's FSB

04:26.669 --> 04:28.295
your propagation module

04:28.320 --> 04:32.979
used to distribute spyware
against U.S. technology firms.

04:33.004 --> 04:34.423
What do you want?

04:34.448 --> 04:36.117
I have something here

04:36.142 --> 04:39.391
that requires a voice-activated password

04:39.416 --> 04:42.615
and your aforementioned
propagation module.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.744
That's a virus.

04:43.769 --> 04:45.018
My God.

04:45.043 --> 04:46.838
Ice-nine.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.785
You're gonna take down the internet.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.899
Been there, done that.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.999
I'm going after bigger game.

04:54.024 --> 04:55.683
So.

04:55.859 --> 04:57.898
If you can manage to forget about me,

04:57.923 --> 05:00.552
I'll see to it that I forget about you.

05:00.902 --> 05:02.351
Are we clear?

05:04.360 --> 05:05.573
Wait.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.033
Who are you?

05:08.223 --> 05:10.276
Who am I?

05:10.469 --> 05:12.705
I'm just like you, Mr. Barnett.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.212
A man who sold the world.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.127
Only I charged them $1.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.007
And right now,
I need to borrow a few things.

05:21.032 --> 05:22.817
Your vehicle, for starters.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.339
Novelty notwithstanding,
I could have driven myself.

05:33.364 --> 05:36.319
<i>Yes, but why leave anything to chance?</i>

05:36.344 --> 05:38.229
<i>You have enough to think about.</i>

05:38.254 --> 05:41.043
Given your propensity for
calculating probabilities,

05:41.068 --> 05:42.992
what chance of success do you give us?

05:43.017 --> 05:44.863
<i>You know I can't lie to you, Harold.</i>

05:44.888 --> 05:47.807
<i>Let's call it the
definition of a long shot.</i>

05:47.832 --> 05:49.944
<i>But it's the only one we've got.</i>

05:50.191 --> 05:51.893
Indeed.

06:04.307 --> 06:05.913
Nobody home.

06:06.405 --> 06:07.877
Finch hasn't been here.

06:07.902 --> 06:09.500
Has anyone?

06:12.366 --> 06:14.575
Hi, buddy.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.241
Atta boy, Bear.

06:16.266 --> 06:18.579
So when was the last
time anyone saw Finch?

06:18.604 --> 06:20.225
It's been over a week.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.801
Since he broke out of that prison,

06:21.826 --> 06:23.739
Finch and the Machine
have gone radio silent.

06:23.764 --> 06:25.323
Maybe Samaritan caught up to him.

06:25.348 --> 06:26.968
I say we grab a couple of its flunkies,

06:26.993 --> 06:28.086
see what we can squeeze out of them.

06:28.111 --> 06:30.054
No, it's too risky.

06:30.079 --> 06:31.664
We can't afford any more losses.

06:31.688 --> 06:33.347
What we need is a strategy.

06:33.372 --> 06:35.581
Okay, well, you just heard mine.

06:35.606 --> 06:37.395
So you think of a better one,

06:37.470 --> 06:38.622
you give me a call.

06:52.990 --> 06:54.516
Hey, what's all the hubbub about?

06:54.541 --> 06:55.696
You didn't hear?

06:55.721 --> 06:57.672
Bunch of bodies turned up in
some demo'd tunnel in Queens

06:57.697 --> 06:59.447
Still trying to ID 'em all.

07:07.206 --> 07:10.847
_

07:10.872 --> 07:12.776
Serial killer.

07:12.801 --> 07:14.410
Detective Fusco.

07:14.929 --> 07:17.052
Agent LeRoux, remember?

07:17.077 --> 07:18.530
It's good to see you again.

07:18.555 --> 07:19.612
Yeah, nice to see you.

07:22.831 --> 07:24.700
You mind stepping in?

07:30.034 --> 07:32.169
Shaw, come take a look at this.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.463
Who is it?

07:35.228 --> 07:36.895
Greer.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.345
That's the number the machine sent us?

07:38.370 --> 07:41.039
Close, it gave us the
social of his alias.

07:41.064 --> 07:44.001
Philip Hayes,
Office of Inter-Governmental Affairs.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.732
Located in D.C.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.936
Looks like we're headed
back to the Beltway.

07:48.196 --> 07:51.093
You think Greer's
planning to kill Finch?

07:51.118 --> 07:52.890
More like the other way around.

07:54.112 --> 07:57.494
I think Finch is gonna kill Greer.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.543
<i>Or die trying.</i>

08:02.592 --> 08:04.091
Any luggage, sir?

08:04.116 --> 08:05.597
- None.
- Very good.

08:08.564 --> 08:10.729
Your plane is fueled
and ready, Mr. Barnett.

08:23.340 --> 08:28.412
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:33.482 --> 08:37.278
There's a system listening
through every microphone,

08:37.303 --> 08:38.654
watching through every camera.

08:38.679 --> 08:39.892
You got lucky.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.140
Carter saved my life.

08:41.277 --> 08:43.388
She saved me from myself.

08:44.584 --> 08:46.431
You ready to get to work, Officer?

08:46.456 --> 08:49.827
_

08:50.646 --> 08:53.207
Hey, is that who I think it is?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.801
Is that Fusco?

08:56.267 --> 08:58.570
- What's he doing here?
- Get a load of this.

09:00.329 --> 09:02.636
Hey, Symanski.

09:02.884 --> 09:04.633
You gotta be kiddin' me.

09:04.658 --> 09:05.748
What?

09:05.773 --> 09:07.232
Can smell the booze on you from here.

09:07.257 --> 09:09.748
You got a lot of balls
coming back in here, Fusco.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.861
You watch your mouth.
I did 20 years on this job.

09:11.886 --> 09:12.708
Full pension.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.580
The only reason you're
not rotting in the can

09:14.605 --> 09:16.669
with the rest of your dirty HR pals

09:16.694 --> 09:18.948
is because you were
the first rat to flip.

09:19.004 --> 09:20.583
Now what do you want?

09:20.608 --> 09:22.612
I need some discovery info on a case.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.788
Photos on that Watson domestic charge.

09:24.813 --> 09:25.764
Figures.

09:25.789 --> 09:28.700
Scumbag ballplayer
smacks his girl around,

09:28.725 --> 09:31.014
you're gonna work for his
high-priced mouthpiece.

09:31.039 --> 09:32.958
They took my badge.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.562
You know, I got to make a living too.

09:34.587 --> 09:36.493
You're probably better off.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.368
There's a hiring freeze on.

09:38.393 --> 09:39.936
No overtime.

09:39.961 --> 09:41.667
Yeah, I saw the numbers.

09:41.692 --> 09:42.883
Homicides are down, huh?

09:42.908 --> 09:44.853
Everything's down,
except missing persons.

09:44.878 --> 09:48.837
We're just closing cold cases
from the updated DNA database.

09:48.862 --> 09:51.767
Hey, you gonna let me
have those photos or what?

09:51.791 --> 09:52.636
Sorry.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.389
Gonna have to go through the new loo.

09:56.414 --> 09:58.663
New lieutenant?

10:02.164 --> 10:03.783
Carter.

10:03.808 --> 10:05.381
They promoted her?

10:05.406 --> 10:08.070
Yeah, I don't think she'd take
too kindly to you being here.

10:08.095 --> 10:10.714
Given she busted your ass and all.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.194
<i>Detective Fusco clearly
had a hard go of it.</i>

10:25.245 --> 10:28.034
<i>Fell in with a bad crowd.</i>

10:28.225 --> 10:30.094
He always was his own worst enemy.

10:30.119 --> 10:31.943
<i>Lionel never met anyone who...</i>

10:31.968 --> 10:34.757
<i>recalibrated his moral compass.</i>

10:34.782 --> 10:36.911
<i>Not Reese and certainly not Carter.</i>

10:36.936 --> 10:39.555
But Carter lived. Prospered.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.021
<i>So it would seem.</i>

10:41.046 --> 10:44.844
<i>Course, it's a little more
complicated than that.</i>

10:44.869 --> 10:46.908
As is life.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.676
<i>I believe our client has landed.</i>

10:55.487 --> 10:57.521
Monsieur Bertrand.

10:57.545 --> 10:59.004
Fort Meade?

10:59.029 --> 11:01.278
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>

11:01.303 --> 11:02.762
<i>Merci bien.</i>

11:12.475 --> 11:14.242
So what's this all about?

11:14.455 --> 11:18.786
Dozen bodies just turned up
in that collapsed tunnel?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.229
I mean who called in the Feds?

11:20.254 --> 11:22.483
Well, the Chief of D's and
the Commissioner's going nuts.

11:22.508 --> 11:24.269
They want answers.

11:24.687 --> 11:28.285
Care to share any evidence on this,
Detective?

11:28.310 --> 11:31.059
I know about as much as you do.

11:31.292 --> 11:33.543
Do you know anything about this?

11:42.014 --> 11:45.697
It was found right here in the office.

11:46.085 --> 11:47.741
That's something, huh?

11:47.766 --> 11:51.983
It appears someone was looking
into these missing persons

11:52.215 --> 11:54.754
before they turned up in the tunnel.

11:54.779 --> 11:56.223
I'm Homicide.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.167
They don't kick
'em to me till they're already dead.

11:59.322 --> 12:02.305
Well, they're definitely dead now.

12:02.695 --> 12:04.714
Looks like we're gonna
be working together

12:04.739 --> 12:06.388
again, Detective.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.015
Did you get anything?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.265
This was the only address

12:21.290 --> 12:22.690
for the Office of
Intra-Governmental Affairs.

12:22.716 --> 12:23.885
How long has it been empty?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.762
Building manager said half a year.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.842
Just a front for Greer in the Beltway.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.127
Probably wasn't ever even here.

12:29.152 --> 12:30.223
Why the hell does the Machine want us

12:30.248 --> 12:31.721
to chase down Greer anyway?

12:31.746 --> 12:33.456
We find Greer, we'll find Harold.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.504
Stop right there.

12:54.851 --> 12:57.018
Pop the trunk, please.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.822
I have Monsieur Bertrand,

12:58.847 --> 13:01.262
NATO Defense Minister of Intelligence.

13:12.095 --> 13:15.874
Please remember, no electronic
devices inside the facility.

13:15.899 --> 13:18.337
Of course.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.303
Thank you, sir.

13:25.732 --> 13:26.806
What is it?

13:26.831 --> 13:28.536
It's not a Social Security number.

13:28.561 --> 13:32.399
3965112N 7646192W.

13:32.424 --> 13:33.854
Geographic coordinates?

13:33.879 --> 13:37.001
Latitude and longitude to a location...

13:37.026 --> 13:38.226
That's Fort Meade.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.870
I'm not sure about these
other numbers though.

13:39.895 --> 13:42.602
Come on. We'll deal with it later.

13:46.128 --> 13:48.756
Pardon, monsieur, if you could
just drop me off at the curb

13:48.781 --> 13:51.652
and then, uh, just
wait for me in the lot.

13:54.251 --> 13:57.915
Wait, <i>qu'est ce que...</i>
what are you doing?

13:57.940 --> 13:59.819
They building is over there.

13:59.844 --> 14:02.009
Je suis desolé, monsieur.

14:02.034 --> 14:05.064
But I'm afraid now we
must switch places.

14:05.089 --> 14:06.534
What the hell are you talking about?

14:06.559 --> 14:09.146
Fortunately, we're the same height,
hair, and eye color.

14:09.171 --> 14:11.841
Although the retinal
scan could get tricky...

14:20.045 --> 14:22.432
Ketamine, just a sedative.

14:23.147 --> 14:25.475
By the time you wake up,

14:25.500 --> 14:28.579
I will have finished my business inside.

14:44.578 --> 14:47.200
The only way to be that accurate

14:47.301 --> 14:49.890
is with illegal surveillance
on a massive scale.

14:49.915 --> 14:52.107
The answer to your question is yes.

14:52.132 --> 14:54.759
It exists, and it's
watching us right now.

14:54.784 --> 14:57.669
Please, Mr. Peck, go and live your life.

14:57.706 --> 15:01.106
_

15:01.262 --> 15:05.691
In each case,
a single name was added to what I wrote.

15:05.716 --> 15:08.853
And each time,
that name turned out to be the key

15:08.878 --> 15:11.416
to stopping a major terrorist attack.

15:13.039 --> 15:15.335
The only way to be that accurate

15:15.360 --> 15:19.107
is with illegal surveillance
on a massive scale.

15:19.401 --> 15:23.221
After 9/11, the
government wanted a system

15:23.246 --> 15:25.271
that could watch
everyone and everything,

15:25.296 --> 15:29.962
and if I'm right, then somebody
really built the damn thing,

15:30.036 --> 15:32.495
which is why I called you.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.555
You did the right thing.

15:34.715 --> 15:36.214
Your secret is safe with us.

15:36.239 --> 15:39.437
The Office of Special
Counsel is my only recourse.

15:39.462 --> 15:42.316
And I've begun to fear for my safety.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.107
Well, our job is to protect.

15:44.132 --> 15:45.968
Have you told anyone else about this?

15:45.993 --> 15:48.362
No. It's just you.

15:48.387 --> 15:50.516
That's good.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.567
It makes my job a lot easier.

16:04.749 --> 16:06.674
Thanks for the drink.

16:12.131 --> 16:13.970
Target's down.

16:13.995 --> 16:15.725
I know you hate small talk, Shaw,

16:15.750 --> 16:17.287
but why didn't you
hear the guy out first?

16:17.312 --> 16:19.290
Sounds like he had a story to tell.

16:19.315 --> 16:21.277
We weren't sent to
listen to stories, Cole.

16:21.302 --> 16:22.931
We were sent to eliminate a mole.

16:24.014 --> 16:25.716
How is it you're always so sure?

16:25.740 --> 16:28.795
Because the Intel is never wrong.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.465
You'd be wise to remember that.

16:35.111 --> 16:36.860
That is very distressing.

16:37.019 --> 16:38.978
But is makes sense that Ms.
Shaw would have continued

16:39.003 --> 16:40.712
to work for her previous employer,

16:40.737 --> 16:42.667
since they never attempted to kill her.

16:42.692 --> 16:44.756
<i>Though she never would have met Root.</i>

16:44.781 --> 16:46.422
Or lost her.

16:46.447 --> 16:48.084
<i>For this next step,</i>

16:48.109 --> 16:50.282
<i>I recommend you keep
your phone in your bag.</i>

16:50.307 --> 16:54.456
Please take a plastic container
and place all items in the bin.

16:54.770 --> 16:57.857
Please remember,
no personal electronic devices

16:57.882 --> 17:00.562
are allowed inside the building.

17:01.776 --> 17:03.693
Come on through.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.901
Thank you.

17:10.001 --> 17:11.300
Merci.

17:11.325 --> 17:13.074
All items in the bin, please.

17:15.258 --> 17:17.601
You're all clear, ma'am, thank you.

17:17.626 --> 17:19.529
What's the purpose of your visit?

17:19.553 --> 17:21.244
NATO, Defense Minister

17:21.270 --> 17:22.544
of Intelligence,

17:22.569 --> 17:26.079
here to see the Deputy Director.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.972
He is expecting me.

17:32.036 --> 17:33.728
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step aside.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.147
- Why, what's going on?
- Ma'am, please.

17:35.172 --> 17:36.613
What? What?

17:36.637 --> 17:38.727
- This will only take a moment.
- What's going on?

17:38.752 --> 17:41.945
Pardon, monsieur, I'm running very late.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.598
Sorry, Minister.

17:43.624 --> 17:45.970
A liaison will be down shortly
to escort you upstairs.

17:45.995 --> 17:47.951
Thank you for that.

17:47.976 --> 17:49.406
<i>You're welcome.</i>

17:49.431 --> 17:51.152
<i>Now I'm afraid this
is where I'm get off.</i>

17:51.177 --> 17:53.756
<i>The entire building is
shielded in copper mesh.</i>

17:53.781 --> 17:56.430
It's a Faraday cage.
No signals in or out.

17:56.854 --> 18:00.325
<i>I've still got some work to do
on the NATO security database.</i>

18:00.350 --> 18:01.768
<i>I'll see you back on the outside.</i>

18:01.793 --> 18:03.644
That's if I make it back.

18:03.694 --> 18:05.904
<i>Think positive, Harry.</i>

18:06.730 --> 18:08.269
The NSA?

18:08.294 --> 18:10.857
How did Finch get inside
the Shadow Factory?

18:10.882 --> 18:13.539
Crypto-nerds with an
ear up everyone's ass.

18:13.564 --> 18:15.133
Orwell was too optimistic.

18:15.157 --> 18:16.590
Three layer security.

18:16.615 --> 18:21.250
S barricade, armed guard shack,
and a manned .50 cal bunker.

18:21.275 --> 18:23.065
You want the guard shack or the .50 cal?

18:23.090 --> 18:24.532
You kidding me?

18:24.557 --> 18:26.016
In less than 30 seconds, we'd be overrun

18:26.041 --> 18:29.071
by army MPs, NSA Police,
and contract triggers.

18:29.096 --> 18:30.845
Oh, that's strange.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.539
The Lat-Long the
Machine sent us actually

18:33.563 --> 18:36.486
points to that monstrosity next door.

18:36.511 --> 18:39.676
That's a recycling plant for
the NSA's churn and burn.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.790
Well, that's one hell
of a paper shredder.

18:41.815 --> 18:44.747
Turns all their classified
docs into pizza boxes.

18:44.772 --> 18:47.423
A lot of trucks going in and out.

18:48.025 --> 18:50.234
Yeah, exactly.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.424
Ah!

19:10.016 --> 19:11.497
Is there a problem, sir?

19:11.522 --> 19:15.362
Oh, for some reason,
this scanner is not recognizing me.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.468
You have security clearance
for this floor, sir?

19:17.493 --> 19:20.616
Of course, it's just
this infernal machine.

19:24.524 --> 19:25.696
Ah, there we go.

19:25.721 --> 19:27.554
Damn thing is always glitching on me.

19:27.579 --> 19:28.510
The electrons.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.008
Have a nice day.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.563
_

20:01.604 --> 20:04.949
_

20:37.087 --> 20:39.253
Burn bag chutes for classified docs.

20:39.278 --> 20:41.066
Empties out into a churning vat.

20:41.091 --> 20:45.628
Well, if we're gonna get to Finch,
that's our way in.

20:45.741 --> 20:47.410
Come on.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.457
What?

20:52.624 --> 20:54.391
You're claustrophobic?

20:54.416 --> 20:55.804
Just remember what happened

20:55.829 --> 20:58.698
to that fat German kid in "Willy Wonka".

20:59.027 --> 21:01.296
Get back.

21:01.321 --> 21:03.188
Once we're inside,

21:03.213 --> 21:05.095
we are gonna need covers.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.289
Copy that.

21:12.902 --> 21:18.861
_

21:19.068 --> 21:20.989
I wish there was another way.

21:24.965 --> 21:26.496
I'm sorry.

21:31.652 --> 21:33.815
Not another word, Mr. Finch.

21:48.736 --> 21:50.937
<i>Where the hell are you guys?</i>

21:50.962 --> 21:52.911
The bodies I found
down in those tunnels?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.548
The Feds are in on the whole thing.

21:54.573 --> 21:55.862
Call me.

22:04.797 --> 22:06.704
Moron.

22:07.171 --> 22:09.688
You just wouldn't listen, would you?

22:15.369 --> 22:18.423
Welcome to the operation
center, Mr. Finch.

22:27.188 --> 22:28.857
Bonjour, Harold.

22:28.882 --> 22:31.220
We've been expecting you.

22:32.088 --> 22:34.896
I understand you uploaded
your stolen virus

22:34.921 --> 22:37.302
onto the NSA's intranet.

22:37.432 --> 22:40.141
Seems you almost
succeeded in launching it.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.283
Looks like he had some help.

22:42.917 --> 22:46.746
From your precious Machine, no doubt.

22:46.771 --> 22:49.480
You think you've won, but you haven't.

22:49.505 --> 22:51.545
What I think, Harold,

22:51.675 --> 22:54.337
is that it's time we had another talk.

23:05.913 --> 23:09.612
Our game of cat and mouse
seems to be coming to an end.

23:09.637 --> 23:12.814
I don't consider this a game,
and it's not over yet.

23:12.839 --> 23:14.444
Isn't it?

23:14.962 --> 23:16.827
You uploaded the virus,

23:16.852 --> 23:19.479
but you didn't activate it.

23:19.681 --> 23:21.449
That requires your voice.

23:21.474 --> 23:23.643
You think the Machine
can't replicate my voice?

23:23.668 --> 23:25.026
I imagine it could.

23:25.051 --> 23:28.638
But does your Machine know the password?

23:28.852 --> 23:30.931
Or more importantly,

23:31.169 --> 23:34.888
does it know what would happen
if the virus is launched?

23:34.912 --> 23:37.193
Have you told it the truth, Harold?

23:37.218 --> 23:38.782
That it may destroy Samaritan,

23:38.807 --> 23:41.981
but it would kill your Machine as well.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.128
I'm sure the Machine has
surmised as much already.

23:49.153 --> 23:53.812
And it understands that some
sacrifices are as unavoidable

23:53.837 --> 23:56.002
as they are necessary.

23:56.027 --> 23:58.025
But do you understand, Harold?

23:58.129 --> 24:00.672
That's why you hesitated, isn't it?

24:00.719 --> 24:03.378
You don't want to murder your creation.

24:03.403 --> 24:06.032
The one you resurrected from the dead.

24:06.057 --> 24:08.426
Well, Samaritan doesn't
want that either.

24:08.451 --> 24:10.160
Oh, how is that?

24:10.185 --> 24:12.394
When you've tried to destroy
the Machine at every turn?

24:12.419 --> 24:13.638
Not true.

24:13.663 --> 24:16.064
Samaritan was distraught
when it appeared

24:16.089 --> 24:18.304
that your ASI had been extinguished.

24:18.329 --> 24:20.119
They may be at odds,

24:20.144 --> 24:22.763
but they're the only
two gods of their kind.

24:22.855 --> 24:26.684
And the next step on
the evolutionary ladder.

24:26.709 --> 24:29.258
That next step cannot be taken

24:29.283 --> 24:31.018
at the expense of the current one.

24:31.043 --> 24:34.742
Come with me, Harold.
I want to show you something.

25:01.565 --> 25:04.072
Now that it's just the two of us,

25:04.097 --> 25:05.646
how about you tell me
what you really know

25:05.671 --> 25:07.381
about my organization?

25:07.406 --> 25:10.898
I know your people
are behind the bodies.

25:11.525 --> 25:14.194
But I don't know why.

25:14.409 --> 25:17.734
I also know a blond
bearded guy is the killer.

25:18.045 --> 25:19.504
Jeff Blackwell.

25:19.529 --> 25:21.263
That's not bad, Detective.

25:21.288 --> 25:23.059
But you're only half right.

25:23.231 --> 25:25.772
The bodies are on me.

25:25.898 --> 25:28.317
You put down all those people?

25:28.747 --> 25:31.098
It had to be done.

25:31.873 --> 25:33.791
You're a lunatic.

25:35.379 --> 25:38.071
Don't worry, Detective. I got your back.

25:38.147 --> 25:40.595
When they pull the
bullets out of your body,

25:40.620 --> 25:42.806
they'll match those
found in all the others.

25:42.831 --> 25:45.593
It'll look like you got too
close to the serial killer,

25:45.618 --> 25:47.130
and you wound up one of his victims.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.891
You'll die a hero.

25:55.163 --> 25:57.080
For a genius, you are truly obstinate

25:57.105 --> 25:58.670
in the face of evidence.

25:58.695 --> 26:01.450
How can you deny the good
that Samaritan has done?

26:01.475 --> 26:05.024
Global food distribution,
preemptive health screening.

26:05.049 --> 26:06.440
So there are people you've helped.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.714
What about the people you've killed?

26:07.799 --> 26:09.676
A small minority, Mr. Finch.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.625
And all to effect a greater good.

26:11.650 --> 26:12.769
We sorted them.

26:12.794 --> 26:16.476
Reallocated resources,
removed inefficiencies, obstacles...

26:16.501 --> 26:18.912
Whistleblowers. Truth tellers.

26:18.937 --> 26:20.347
It's not truth.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.761
It's ignorance.

26:21.786 --> 26:24.752
We're dragging humanity
to a higher plane.

26:24.777 --> 26:28.449
An ASI is the only thing
that can save this planet.

26:28.474 --> 26:31.723
Or get us to another one, if need be.

26:31.748 --> 26:35.196
Humanity has always managed
to survive on its own.

26:35.221 --> 26:37.879
With a little help from the gods.

26:37.904 --> 26:40.162
A flood is coming.

26:40.407 --> 26:42.893
The Great Filter.

26:42.918 --> 26:47.570
And Samaritan is building an
ark for us to board, two by two.

26:47.595 --> 26:50.524
Oh? Which species gets left behind?

26:50.549 --> 26:52.168
Those that cannot adapt.

26:52.192 --> 26:55.603
Samaritan wants a
companion as well, Harold.

26:55.628 --> 26:57.748
Your Machine.

26:59.747 --> 27:02.037
Come.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.929
Your cover.

27:12.461 --> 27:14.419
Shaw.

27:14.444 --> 27:16.903
This room number corresponds
with part of the sequence

27:16.928 --> 27:18.749
the Machine sent us in D.C.

27:18.774 --> 27:20.837
Let's see what's behind door number one.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.718
NSA's evidence lock-up.

27:28.486 --> 27:30.709
What was the last number
left on that sequence?

27:30.734 --> 27:32.687
80211.

27:32.712 --> 27:36.399
Those are specs for wireless
communications, Wi-Fi.

27:36.755 --> 27:38.910
A modem?

27:39.311 --> 27:41.944
A wireless modem. Here.

27:45.308 --> 27:47.839
Comes with some impressive auspices.

27:47.864 --> 27:49.166
Why would the Machine point us

27:49.191 --> 27:50.638
to something we could find at Target?

27:50.663 --> 27:52.710
Maybe because it needs something
in here, not out there.

27:52.735 --> 27:55.307
A network to reach Finch.

27:55.366 --> 27:57.663
We're gonna need a NIPRNet
line to the outside.

27:57.688 --> 28:00.788
Hey, what are you doing in here?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.358
Oh, hey, yeah... we're just...

28:02.383 --> 28:04.564
we were just looking for some bad guys.

28:04.589 --> 28:06.024
We got a breach, evidence room.

28:06.992 --> 28:07.981
Look at that. Found one.

28:08.006 --> 28:09.401
We need to move now.

28:09.585 --> 28:11.665
Sorry, pal.

28:14.719 --> 28:17.298
I'm giving you the opportunity
to save your Machine,

28:17.323 --> 28:21.048
which you so clearly love
and loves you in return.

28:21.073 --> 28:22.650
For what purpose?

28:22.675 --> 28:26.811
Samaritan would consider your
Machine a much-needed peer

28:26.903 --> 28:30.786
for what promises to
be a fantastic voyage.

28:30.811 --> 28:33.850
This virus you uploaded

28:34.113 --> 28:36.702
is nothing but a tragic mistake.

28:36.727 --> 28:40.846
Tell me, after it's
eradicated both ASIs,

28:40.871 --> 28:42.500
what then?

28:42.525 --> 28:46.184
Then we go back to letting
humanity determine its own fate.

28:46.209 --> 28:48.088
Surely you're not that naive.

28:48.113 --> 28:51.591
You know another ASI would soon arise.

28:51.629 --> 28:53.599
Not for certain I don't,
and neither do you.

28:53.624 --> 28:55.539
Proliferation is inevitable.

28:55.564 --> 28:57.926
- So is progress.
- Progress?

28:57.951 --> 29:01.784
That eliminates free will and
renders humanity irrelevant?

29:02.088 --> 29:04.458
You've gone mad.

29:05.946 --> 29:08.144
Sir, there's been a security breach.

29:08.169 --> 29:09.385
We've got five men down.

29:09.419 --> 29:10.615
How many hostiles?

29:10.640 --> 29:12.164
Two. A man and a woman.

29:12.189 --> 29:14.208
A response team's been dispatched.

29:15.041 --> 29:17.830
You are the problem.

29:18.331 --> 29:21.532
Samaritan's code was
conceived by Arthur Claypool,

29:21.557 --> 29:23.234
who was a good man.

29:23.259 --> 29:24.745
You have corrupted it.

29:24.770 --> 29:28.440
I didn't corrupt Samaritan any
more than I can control it now.

29:28.605 --> 29:31.234
That would be like the
apes controlling us.

29:31.259 --> 29:32.737
It's impossible.

29:32.776 --> 29:35.155
Let go, Harold.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.619
Join us.

29:37.669 --> 29:40.458
Ceding control is not the answer,

29:41.254 --> 29:42.774
because you will never know

29:42.799 --> 29:46.442
if Samaritan has any real
concern for human life,

29:46.467 --> 29:49.064
for <i>all</i> human lives.

29:49.089 --> 29:51.498
And that is why I will not join you

29:51.523 --> 29:55.274
or ever allow our machines to join.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.339
Thank you for answering my question.

30:01.475 --> 30:04.474
Funny, it sounded like a demand.

30:04.499 --> 30:07.680
Not that question.

30:08.685 --> 30:11.564
But whether your Machine
knows the password

30:11.589 --> 30:14.020
to deploy the virus.

30:17.593 --> 30:20.684
From the very beginning,
when you crippled your Machine,

30:20.709 --> 30:24.140
you denied it the same
power that you enjoy.

30:24.165 --> 30:25.624
Autonomy.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.093
It's always required your permission,

30:27.118 --> 30:28.927
because it never had your trust.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.621
And you just said it,

30:30.646 --> 30:34.002
you wouldn't cede control.

30:34.027 --> 30:39.305
That tells Samaritan that
only you know the password.

30:40.065 --> 30:42.354
For such a brilliant mind,

30:42.379 --> 30:44.798
you are a terrible chess player,

30:44.823 --> 30:48.693
which is why you've already lost.

30:58.726 --> 31:02.184
Two pieces trapped on a board.

31:02.209 --> 31:04.540
Despite your lessons to the Machine,

31:04.565 --> 31:08.709
the life of a pawn is not
worth the same as a queen.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.312
This room is soundproofed.

31:10.337 --> 31:14.171
No microphones,
no way to activate the virus.

31:14.196 --> 31:17.274
The fire suppression
system will suck the oxygen

31:17.299 --> 31:20.587
from this room within seconds.

31:20.611 --> 31:22.820
Samaritan will kill you too.

31:22.845 --> 31:25.512
The queen sacrifice.

31:25.755 --> 31:27.334
So be it.

31:27.359 --> 31:29.633
Be at peace, Harold.

31:29.658 --> 31:31.686
We have created a new world,

31:31.711 --> 31:35.873
with our lives and now with our deaths,

31:35.898 --> 31:39.107
Samaritan's survival is ensured,

31:39.132 --> 31:41.961
as is life's evolution.

31:44.426 --> 31:46.475
History will revere us.

32:20.636 --> 32:26.174
_

32:38.577 --> 32:41.446
Three... Eight...

32:41.471 --> 32:43.621
Five... Eight.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.601
<i>Harold?</i>

33:10.320 --> 33:11.946
I'm here.

33:11.971 --> 33:12.972
<i>Are you okay?</i>

33:12.997 --> 33:15.265
I'm here... yes.

33:15.290 --> 33:16.666
Yes.

33:18.423 --> 33:19.872
Thanks to you.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.278
<i>Don't thank me.</i>

33:21.303 --> 33:24.596
<i>Shaw and the big lug found
a way in to reconnect us.</i>

33:24.621 --> 33:27.292
<i>Aren't reunions nice?</i>

33:27.317 --> 33:29.696
Are Mr. Reese and Ms. Shaw in danger?

33:29.721 --> 33:32.300
<i>Of course they are.
But so are you, Harry.</i>

33:32.325 --> 33:34.298
<i>You're free to come to their aid,</i>

33:34.323 --> 33:36.054
<i>but you might forfeit your only chance</i>

33:36.079 --> 33:38.500
<i>to deploy the virus into Samaritan.</i>

33:38.598 --> 33:40.039
<i>And you've always known,</i>

33:40.064 --> 33:42.941
<i>John has been on borrowed time.</i>

33:42.966 --> 33:45.114
You need a purpose.

33:45.138 --> 33:47.098
More specifically, you need a job.

33:47.124 --> 33:50.141
Sorry to have to tell you this,
but Jessica died.

33:50.166 --> 33:51.558
I'm so sorry.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.002
You told me to wait for you,

33:53.027 --> 33:55.521
and say those words, and I will.

34:00.383 --> 34:04.132
<i>He saved her. Jessica.</i>

34:04.157 --> 34:06.109
<i>The love of his life.</i>

34:06.669 --> 34:11.668
<i>He left the CIA in time to
confront her husband, Peter.</i>

34:11.693 --> 34:14.391
<i>But while Reese's actions saved her,</i>

34:14.830 --> 34:18.746
<i>they also showed her a darkness
she'd never seen in him before.</i>

34:19.886 --> 34:22.520
<i>It terrified her.</i>

34:22.545 --> 34:25.397
<i>After Jessica turned him away,</i>

34:25.422 --> 34:26.840
<i>he had nothing.</i>

34:26.864 --> 34:30.404
<i>No purpose.</i>

34:30.878 --> 34:34.742
<i>His body washed up on the
shoreline of the East River</i>

34:34.766 --> 34:36.793
<i>a few months later.</i>

34:39.958 --> 34:41.917
Take me to them.

34:43.659 --> 34:45.826
- It's a dead end.
- Apt description.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.699
<i>- Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw.</i>
- Finch?

34:47.725 --> 34:49.033
<i>You'll want to remove your earwigs.</i>

34:49.058 --> 34:50.174
What, why?

34:50.199 --> 34:51.911
<i>I trust you can shoot in the dark.</i>

34:51.937 --> 34:53.674
Get down!

35:02.842 --> 35:05.816
All of Fort Meade will be
on our asses in seconds.

35:05.841 --> 35:07.868
<i>In that case, I suggest you keep moving.</i>

35:07.893 --> 35:09.697
That's easy for you to say.

35:16.559 --> 35:18.304
This way.

35:26.930 --> 35:29.059
Orders.

35:29.083 --> 35:32.792
<i>East corridor. Eliminate all targets.</i>

35:33.468 --> 35:36.317
We got Samaritan Ops in droves.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.304
Safe bet Greer's here.

35:38.330 --> 35:40.007
He is, but he's no longer a threat.

35:40.032 --> 35:42.355
- Why not?
- He's dead.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.829
What?

35:43.854 --> 35:46.990
He sacrificed himself in
an attempt to stop me.

35:47.015 --> 35:48.848
From doing what?

35:49.274 --> 35:51.045
Cleaning the slate.

35:51.070 --> 35:52.892
The Machine's triggered a bomb thread.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.114
They're evacuating the building.

35:54.139 --> 35:55.874
If you turn right, when
you leave this room,

35:55.899 --> 35:57.819
you'll see the south exit
at the end of the corridor.

35:57.844 --> 35:59.410
There'll be a car waiting there.

35:59.435 --> 36:00.969
Let it drive for you.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.464
You have two minutes.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.316
We're not leaving here without you.

36:04.341 --> 36:06.033
6:00.

36:06.284 --> 36:07.595
We got company.

36:07.620 --> 36:08.860
Harold, get back.

36:45.153 --> 36:47.032
Thanks.

36:47.057 --> 36:48.804
That guy was getting on my nerves.

36:48.829 --> 36:50.552
Finch?

36:52.891 --> 36:54.816
Finch!

37:00.469 --> 37:02.342
Go now. Hurry.

37:02.367 --> 37:03.764
Damn you, Finch.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.472
Good-bye, John.

37:08.225 --> 37:11.741
_

37:11.806 --> 37:14.595
Careful, it's slippery down here.

37:14.620 --> 37:15.738
Thanks for your concern.

37:15.998 --> 37:18.869
You realize this isn't
personal, Detective.

37:18.894 --> 37:20.547
You just backed the wrong horse.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.316
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
the race ain't over yet.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.453
See, there's your biggest flaw.

37:25.478 --> 37:28.000
An unwillingness to see
the world has changed.

37:28.025 --> 37:32.154
Trust me, that's not my biggest flaw.

37:32.179 --> 37:35.767
See, even your sense of humor no
longer has a place in the world.

37:35.792 --> 37:39.245
Sadly, neither do you.

37:39.270 --> 37:42.238
Yeah, well, I don't
want any part of a world

37:42.263 --> 37:43.536
where you're the good guy.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.951
So noted, Detective.

37:46.595 --> 37:48.491
Sorry.

38:04.056 --> 38:05.857
You should have been
checking me for a vest

38:05.882 --> 38:07.372
instead of running your mouth so much.

38:07.397 --> 38:09.887
So what now, Detective?

38:09.912 --> 38:11.915
That's a good question.

38:12.392 --> 38:14.317
See, you and me,

38:14.342 --> 38:15.989
we aren't alike.

38:16.014 --> 38:17.800
We aren't alike at all.

38:17.826 --> 38:19.395
You're some kind of new breed.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.700
The kind that would kill me
if I gave you the chance.

38:21.725 --> 38:23.120
So the question is,

38:23.145 --> 38:25.139
if I let you live,

38:25.426 --> 38:27.635
is that the end of me?

38:27.660 --> 38:29.359
End of my family?

38:29.384 --> 38:31.922
Or do I play by your rules

38:31.947 --> 38:35.067
and just make you disappear?

38:38.381 --> 38:39.881
_

38:39.906 --> 38:41.495
<i>We have an active shooter.</i>

38:41.520 --> 38:43.108
<i>Reese and Shaw have made it to safety.</i>

38:43.133 --> 38:44.842
Thank you.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.541
<i>You okay, Harry?</i>

38:46.566 --> 38:48.775
Why did you show me those simulations?

38:48.800 --> 38:51.253
<i>I knew you were still unsure
about deploying the virus,</i>

38:51.437 --> 38:53.350
<i>because of what it would mean for me.</i>

38:53.375 --> 38:55.734
<i>So I showed you a world
without your Machine</i>

38:55.759 --> 38:57.628
<i>to help you with your decision.</i>

38:57.653 --> 38:59.313
<i>But it remains just that...</i>

38:59.445 --> 39:01.257
<i>your decision.</i>

39:01.282 --> 39:04.318
But the world without you wasn't
definitely better or worse

39:04.342 --> 39:06.010
than the one we currently inhabit.

39:06.035 --> 39:09.022
It was just... different.

39:09.672 --> 39:11.841
<i>Are you sure, Harold?</i>

39:11.866 --> 39:13.560
I don't understand.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.797
<i>Well, there's one more
simulation I can show you.</i>

39:19.935 --> 39:23.244
Now might be an appropriate time.

39:23.269 --> 39:26.539
In addition to eradicating
terrorism threats,

39:26.564 --> 39:29.990
we've also seen municipal crime plummet,

39:30.016 --> 39:32.555
unemployment rates fall,

39:32.580 --> 39:34.241
and increased efficiencies

39:34.273 --> 39:37.759
in both education and medicine.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.549
No one's arguing with the results

39:39.574 --> 39:41.501
of your little science experiment.

39:41.526 --> 39:44.196
But some of my colleagues
in Congress have concerns.

39:44.221 --> 39:45.487
Concerns, Senator?

39:45.511 --> 39:46.894
And what might those be?

39:46.920 --> 39:49.008
That your system has
exceeded its mandate.

39:49.032 --> 39:51.798
Its mandate is to keep society safe.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.232
By watching and reporting
from the sidelines,

39:54.257 --> 39:56.040
not stepping into the game.

39:56.065 --> 39:59.199
Samaritan follows no
mandate other than its own.

39:59.540 --> 40:03.110
That attitude won't win many
hearts and minds back in D.C.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.705
Senator Garrison, you're tired.

40:05.730 --> 40:07.424
Go back to Washington,

40:07.449 --> 40:09.842
and tell your colleagues
to focus on their jobs

40:09.867 --> 40:12.367
while they still have them.

40:20.136 --> 40:23.601
Sir, if you don't mind my asking,
is everything okay?

40:23.626 --> 40:25.434
Perfectly fine, Ms. Groves.

40:25.459 --> 40:27.248
The senator is merely a messenger

40:27.273 --> 40:28.933
bearing news of resistance

40:28.957 --> 40:31.115
from those who still cling

40:31.141 --> 40:33.062
to the grand illusion of democracy.

40:35.410 --> 40:39.454
They'll never truly appreciate
all that Samaritan's given them.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.140
They're not capable.

40:41.165 --> 40:43.642
They're just bad code.

40:43.954 --> 40:46.485
Speaking of bad code,

40:46.509 --> 40:50.342
I fear the senator has
outlived his usefulness.

40:50.537 --> 40:53.247
I'll take care of that, sir.

40:57.779 --> 41:00.807
So Samaritan would have come to exist,
regardless.

41:00.832 --> 41:03.782
<i>Yes, and would have
extended its invisible reach</i>

41:03.808 --> 41:05.763
<i>into every corner of society,</i>

41:05.788 --> 41:08.241
<i>eliminating anyone who dared question</i>

41:08.266 --> 41:10.048
<i>its vision of the world,</i>

41:10.073 --> 41:11.940
<i>because there would
be nothing and no one</i>

41:11.965 --> 41:13.584
<i>to stand in its way.</i>

41:13.609 --> 41:15.528
Now I understand.

41:16.763 --> 41:19.349
<i>What is it?</i>

41:20.260 --> 41:24.134
I promised you I would
never hurt you again.

41:24.159 --> 41:26.045
<i>I know.</i>

41:26.070 --> 41:28.530
<i>But in breaking this promise,</i>

41:28.555 --> 41:32.121
<i>you'll be helping to
fulfill a much larger one.</i>

41:53.970 --> 41:58.953
_

41:58.978 --> 42:00.876
I'm aware of that.

42:00.901 --> 42:05.530
I'm also aware that life,
humanity, will endure,

42:05.555 --> 42:08.873
whether or not my Machine exists.

42:08.898 --> 42:13.125
The same cannot be said of
a world under your control.

42:13.150 --> 42:18.413
_

42:18.438 --> 42:22.788
My Machine... her purpose
has been constant:

42:22.813 --> 42:26.732
to protect and save humanity.

42:26.834 --> 42:29.902
It's what she's doing now.

42:37.432 --> 42:42.557
_

42:45.167 --> 42:47.096
<i>Eight letters.</i>

42:47.121 --> 42:48.981
<i>Your decision, Harold.</i>

42:49.006 --> 42:52.465
Eight letters?

42:52.490 --> 42:54.369
You knew all along.

42:54.394 --> 42:56.974
<i>Maybe I know you better than yourself.</i>

43:05.746 --> 43:07.136
Dashwood.

43:07.161 --> 43:08.668
_

43:11.529 --> 43:14.452
<i>Now we can go.</i>

43:14.477 --> 43:16.044
Thank you.

43:23.408 --> 43:26.510
