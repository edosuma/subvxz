00:01.242 --> 00:02.726
<i>Previously on
"The Company You Keep"...</i>

00:02.726 --> 00:04.487
<i>Claire Fox is here,
and she wants a word.</i>

00:04.487 --> 00:05.764
Simon?

00:05.764 --> 00:07.352
<i>Yeah, he started
calling last week.</i>

00:07.352 --> 00:10.079
The thing is, I love you.

00:11.390 --> 00:12.426
Oh, God.

00:12.426 --> 00:14.152
There's this little
CIA spook.

00:14.152 --> 00:17.603
She's smart, tenacious,
a real caped crusader.

00:17.603 --> 00:19.398
Hey, Daphne Finch
is coming for you.

00:19.398 --> 00:21.021
Why are you telling me this?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.368
Because I love you too.

00:25.094 --> 00:27.613
Say something.

00:27.613 --> 00:30.927
Em, just say something.

00:32.687 --> 00:33.792
You lied to me.

00:33.792 --> 00:34.793
I never lied to you.

00:34.793 --> 00:36.967
I--I never lied.

00:36.967 --> 00:39.039
I just--I didn't tell you
the whole truth.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.179
That's the same thing, Charlie.

00:41.179 --> 00:42.628
Was any of it real?

00:42.628 --> 00:44.423
Everything that you and I
have felt has been real.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.115
Come on, Em. You know that.

00:46.115 --> 00:47.599
I don't know anything anymore.

00:47.599 --> 00:48.738
You're a criminal.

00:48.738 --> 00:50.222
It's not like that. Listen.

00:50.222 --> 00:52.190
My family and I, we target
people who deserve it.

00:52.190 --> 00:53.398
And I wanted to get out.

00:53.398 --> 00:55.883
I--I have tried to get out.

00:55.883 --> 00:56.987
But Daphne found us.

00:56.987 --> 00:57.988
And she's put--

00:57.988 --> 00:59.093
Just stop.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.474
You're not victims, Charlie.

01:00.474 --> 01:02.234
You're working for people
who do horrible things.

01:02.234 --> 01:03.477
It's as black and white
as it gets.

01:03.477 --> 01:04.788
Nothing is black and white.

01:04.788 --> 01:06.721
You of all people
should understand that

01:06.721 --> 01:08.378
better than anyone.
- What does that even mean?

01:08.378 --> 01:10.415
Daphne has got dirt
on your family.

01:10.415 --> 01:13.003
And it's bad enough,
she thinks she can use it.

01:13.003 --> 01:14.453
Why?

01:14.453 --> 01:15.972
What's her endgame?
What is she hiding?

01:15.972 --> 01:18.285
Look, all I know is that
she's Maguire's daughter

01:18.285 --> 01:20.804
and that she and Connor
are in a battle

01:20.804 --> 01:24.291
to run the organization.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.568
Okay. What else?

01:25.568 --> 01:26.741
Why is she meeting with rivals?

01:26.741 --> 01:28.260
Why is she dumping drugs
on the cheap?

01:28.260 --> 01:29.296
What is her big plan?

01:29.296 --> 01:32.092
I don't know.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.265
Then you're of no use to me.

01:34.611 --> 01:35.785
Hey, whoa, whoa.

01:35.785 --> 01:38.788
I--I put my family at risk

01:38.788 --> 01:41.101
telling you that
she is targeting yours.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.136
Don't worry.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.517
The agency doesn't care

01:43.517 --> 01:45.622
about some
small-time criminals.

01:46.865 --> 01:48.798
But if you happen to be
with Daphne Finch

01:48.798 --> 01:52.664
when we take her down,
that is on you.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.173
Well, well, that was fast.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.450
I feel so special.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.727
- Don't.
- Oh, come on.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.073
At least we don't
have to whisper

02:23.073 --> 02:24.178
so barflies don't eavesdrop.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.283
You having fun?

02:25.283 --> 02:28.009
I'm not not having fun.

02:28.009 --> 02:29.666
What do you want?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.875
It turns out, that
little black book you stole

02:31.875 --> 02:34.361
is a veritable gold mine
of useful tidbits.

02:34.361 --> 02:35.534
Okay.

02:35.534 --> 02:37.502
This Erin Blenner painting

02:37.502 --> 02:40.919
was recently purchased
by a man named Grigori Abramov.

02:40.919 --> 02:43.508
I want it.

02:43.508 --> 02:47.201
I can't imagine this is
just about some painting.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.754
What are you really
going after?

02:48.754 --> 02:51.240
I am looking to get into
a new line of business.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.345
And Grigori Abramov is the key.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.002
It says this thing sold
for over $2 million

02:55.002 --> 02:56.106
on the open market.

02:56.106 --> 02:59.213
How about
I get it for you at 3?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.904
I dictate the terms.

03:00.904 --> 03:02.561
- I'm not negotiating.
- Are you forgetting--

03:02.561 --> 03:04.529
Hey, if you want
to find somebody else

03:04.529 --> 03:07.083
to fund your little battle
for power with Connor,

03:07.083 --> 03:08.118
you go right ahead.

03:08.118 --> 03:09.568
Otherwise, why don't you start

03:09.568 --> 03:12.778
treating us
with a little respect?

03:16.713 --> 03:19.095
I don't know
what's going on with you.

03:22.132 --> 03:24.238
But I don't hate this.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.970
$3 million.

03:43.844 --> 03:45.086
Hey.

03:45.086 --> 03:47.606
Was it a good family meeting
or a bad family meeting?

03:53.854 --> 03:55.649
Top shelf family meeting.

03:57.306 --> 03:58.824
Charlie, you okay?

04:00.481 --> 04:02.449
I'm not really sure
where to start.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.866
Beginning's
as good a place as any, son.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.595
Emma is a CIA officer.

04:10.595 --> 04:12.976
Please tell me
you're kidding.

04:12.976 --> 04:14.392
No, I am not.

04:16.566 --> 04:17.809
So that's why
you broke up with her.

04:17.809 --> 04:19.604
That's why
you've been acting weird.

04:19.604 --> 04:21.502
That's not even
the worst part.

04:21.502 --> 04:24.298
How is that not
the worst part?

04:24.298 --> 04:27.025
Because Emma works
for a group

04:27.025 --> 04:31.581
that focuses on
transnational organized crime.

04:31.581 --> 04:33.100
She has been investigating

04:33.100 --> 04:37.449
Daphne
and the Maguire syndicate.

04:37.449 --> 04:39.831
Okay, that's worse.

04:41.557 --> 04:42.903
Is she coming after us?

04:44.249 --> 04:45.630
No.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.839
But she did warn me that
if we're in the cross-hairs

04:47.839 --> 04:50.842
when she makes a move on
Daphne, we're going down too.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.502
CIA.

04:55.502 --> 04:57.676
Yeah, I know. CIA.

04:57.676 --> 05:00.990
Pop, I know.

05:00.990 --> 05:04.994
Look, we can't just
pull up stakes with Daphne,

05:04.994 --> 05:07.030
all right, not while Connor
is still out there.

05:07.030 --> 05:08.998
No, we--we gotta do
this next job for her.

05:08.998 --> 05:10.827
She wants us to lift
some painting

05:10.827 --> 05:13.485
from a Russian oligarch,
Grigori Abramov.

05:13.485 --> 05:17.351
In other words, we can't stay
out of the CIA's crosshairs.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.732
No.

05:18.732 --> 05:21.700
Do you really think that
Emma would just burn us?

05:25.911 --> 05:27.188
I...

05:28.880 --> 05:32.366
Whatever she felt for me,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.403
for us,

05:34.403 --> 05:36.750
that's over.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.235
Uh, she made that
crystal clear.

05:50.522 --> 05:51.661
Honey?

05:55.734 --> 05:57.046
What is it?

06:01.568 --> 06:03.190
You were right...

06:07.263 --> 06:09.783
About Charlie.

06:09.783 --> 06:13.303
Oh, honey,
I'm so sorry.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.417
One of these days,

06:23.417 --> 06:24.522
we're gonna have a long talk

06:24.522 --> 06:26.316
about your taste in women.

06:26.316 --> 06:32.150
Okay, so Abramov has a place
at the Lovett in Hudson Yards.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.565
The building manager
there has a--

06:33.565 --> 06:35.809
You're really gonna pretend
like we don't already have

06:35.809 --> 06:38.259
the perfect in
in the New York art scene?

06:38.259 --> 06:39.399
No.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.434
Charlie, the answer's no.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.299
He's been calling for weeks, Bird.

06:43.299 --> 06:45.750
He's--he's practically
primed himself

06:45.750 --> 06:48.269
like a gift wrapped for us.

06:48.269 --> 06:50.340
I can't believe
you're seriously suggesting

06:50.340 --> 06:52.722
bringing Simon back
into my life for some job.

06:52.722 --> 06:55.104
This is not just some job.

06:55.104 --> 06:57.934
What better way to get out
from underneath Daphne

06:57.934 --> 07:01.179
than to get back at an ex
at the same time?

07:01.179 --> 07:03.492
I'm pretty sure the shrinks
call that projection.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.947
You know, once upon a time,
you were an art history major

07:10.947 --> 07:12.259
living in New York

07:12.259 --> 07:14.192
with your trendy,
art-dealing boyfriend,

07:14.192 --> 07:16.436
rubbing elbows
with rich collectors.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.817
You've got a built-in cover, Bird.

07:18.817 --> 07:22.580
And it is real.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.479
You and I, we both know
Simon is the most efficient way

07:25.479 --> 07:26.515
to that painting.

07:26.515 --> 07:27.481
It's not the logic

07:27.481 --> 07:30.588
that I'm struggling with here, Charlie.

07:30.588 --> 07:33.798
Look, I'm asking you
to play a part,

07:33.798 --> 07:36.179
no different than--than any
other job that we've done.

07:36.179 --> 07:38.975
No, you're asking me
to step into a life

07:38.975 --> 07:42.392
I left behind
with a man who broke my heart.

07:50.435 --> 07:51.850
Once an addict,
always in addict.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.334
Even they'll tell you that.

07:53.334 --> 07:55.026
Why would you talk
your sister into this?

07:55.026 --> 07:56.510
I didn't talk her
into anything.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.029
Look, she knows Simon
is the fastest way

07:58.029 --> 07:59.479
to that painting.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.860
Fastest, yes, best, no.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.034
You don't know how bad it got.

08:03.034 --> 08:04.207
You weren't there when he left.

08:04.207 --> 08:05.381
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:05.381 --> 08:07.003
I was in a Nicaraguan jail
at the time.

08:07.003 --> 08:09.074
Forgive me.

08:09.074 --> 08:12.181
Charlie,
I would never downplay

08:12.181 --> 08:13.976
what you did for this family.

08:13.976 --> 08:17.669
I only meant,
you weren't there.

08:29.405 --> 08:30.406
Hi.

08:32.581 --> 08:33.547
Hi.

08:34.893 --> 08:36.343
Thank you. Thanks.

08:37.413 --> 08:39.070
I can't believe
it's been, what--

08:39.070 --> 08:40.830
10 years.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.350
Until you started calling,
I had no idea whether

08:43.350 --> 08:45.732
you were alive or dead.

08:45.732 --> 08:48.458
Yeah, a couple of times,
I wasn't sure, either.

08:49.977 --> 08:51.600
I wasn't right back then.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.742
I was a--

08:55.742 --> 08:59.331
I am--an addict.

09:01.817 --> 09:05.061
And I know I can't do
anything to take that back.

09:05.061 --> 09:06.580
But I've changed, Bird.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.581
I swear to you.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.583
I wouldn't have called you
if I hadn't.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.451
I am so sorry

09:15.451 --> 09:18.212
for leaving you
to raise our daughter alone.

09:18.212 --> 09:20.145
I wasn't alone.

09:20.145 --> 09:22.147
I had my family.

09:22.147 --> 09:25.288
And I am so grateful to them
for that.

09:27.187 --> 09:28.291
Can I ask about her?

09:28.291 --> 09:30.155
I mean, how is she?

09:30.155 --> 09:31.432
That's not what this is.

09:31.432 --> 09:33.745
That's not why I called you.

09:33.745 --> 09:37.922
Can you get close to a man
named Grigori Abramov?

09:37.922 --> 09:41.063
I sold him a Selden sculpture
a few years ago.

09:41.063 --> 09:42.271
I mean, I can try.

09:43.444 --> 09:45.585
But Bird, I mean,
do I even want to know?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.310
Probably not.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.521
I'll do anything
that you want.

09:51.521 --> 09:54.421
All I ask is that
you at least consider

09:54.421 --> 09:56.630
the possibility
that I've changed.

10:38.707 --> 10:42.469
Only a matter of time before
she finds her way down there.

10:42.469 --> 10:44.540
And you know what happens next:

10:44.540 --> 10:45.990
the talk.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.889
I am not ready for the talk.

10:48.889 --> 10:51.029
When she finds out what we do,
her innocence is gone.

10:51.029 --> 10:52.168
Oh, come on.

10:52.168 --> 10:53.307
When you were her age,

10:53.307 --> 10:55.413
not only were you
down in the basement,

10:55.413 --> 10:57.864
you were out in the alley
sneaking menthols.

11:35.108 --> 11:37.731
So Simon has secured
invites for himself

11:37.731 --> 11:41.217
and Birdie
to Abramov's monthly salon.

11:41.217 --> 11:42.287
Salon?

11:42.287 --> 11:43.633
Who is this guy, Louis XIV?

11:43.633 --> 11:45.566
Yeah, he wishes.

11:45.566 --> 11:48.431
It takes place
at his 35th floor penthouse,

11:48.431 --> 11:50.606
which screams asset laundering

11:50.606 --> 11:52.021
and conspicuous consumption.

11:52.021 --> 11:53.954
So we should expect
heavy security.

11:53.954 --> 11:56.716
Birdie is gonna be looking
for a point of entry

11:56.716 --> 11:59.097
to lift the painting
from the inside.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.409
Which puts you in the van,

12:00.409 --> 12:01.755
if you feel like
you can handle it.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.757
I was built for that.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.863
You're gonna need a dress, sweetie.

12:05.863 --> 12:07.071
Yep.

12:07.071 --> 12:09.142
Simon and I used to do
these type of parties

12:09.142 --> 12:10.419
all the time.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.250
Are you sure
you're up for this?

12:14.250 --> 12:15.424
What do you mean?

12:15.424 --> 12:17.598
He was always
your blind spot.

12:17.598 --> 12:19.324
Oh, not this time.

12:25.883 --> 12:27.574
<i>♪ You got what they want</i>

12:27.574 --> 12:29.058
<i>♪ You got what they need</i>

12:29.058 --> 12:33.338
<i>♪ So sit back, relax,
and communicate ♪</i>

12:36.341 --> 12:37.964
You look terrific.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.898
Well.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.073
Ah. Ma'am.

12:53.358 --> 12:55.947
Ah, there he is, Grigori.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.017
My friend.

12:57.017 --> 12:58.536
You made it.

13:00.296 --> 13:02.643
Hey, listen,
any sales you make tonight,

13:02.643 --> 13:04.300
you kick over
a hefty finder's fee, eh?

13:05.681 --> 13:08.857
Grigori, let me
introduce you to my...

13:08.857 --> 13:09.719
Birdie.

13:09.719 --> 13:11.376
This is--uh, this is Birdie.

13:11.376 --> 13:12.481
Hmm.
- Birdie.

13:12.481 --> 13:13.551
I can't wait to see

13:13.551 --> 13:14.655
that Selden that he sold you.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.657
Yeah. Yeah, please.

13:16.657 --> 13:17.797
Make some friends.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.557
Make some memories.

13:19.557 --> 13:21.317
Make some mistakes.

13:21.317 --> 13:23.112
Or if you're like me,
all three at once.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.665
- I like him.
- He's not kidding.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.047
Thank you. I'll see you later.

13:27.047 --> 13:28.221
Okay.

13:28.221 --> 13:30.464
Grigori, we need you.

13:30.464 --> 13:31.776
Okay.

13:33.571 --> 13:35.159
Hey, Simon.
- Hey.

13:41.475 --> 13:42.856
Here we go.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.170
Hearing you loud and clear,

13:46.170 --> 13:49.863
getting schematics of the room
as we speak.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.520
Any sign of that painting?

13:51.520 --> 13:54.695
No sign of the Blenner
so far.

14:08.778 --> 14:10.056
That's weird.

14:10.056 --> 14:12.713
There's no laser detectors
on any of his art.

14:12.713 --> 14:14.888
How's the security?

14:14.888 --> 14:16.786
Surprisingly little.

14:16.786 --> 14:19.272
Wow, this guy's cocky.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.693
What'd Charlie do now?

14:26.693 --> 14:28.246
Not Charlie.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.077
You.

14:47.783 --> 14:49.647
How did you get these?

14:49.647 --> 14:51.821
Is that Claire Fox?

14:56.309 --> 15:00.485
Your mother and I
were in a rough patch

15:00.485 --> 15:02.763
before we all moved out here.

15:05.663 --> 15:09.046
Claire and I had an affair
for a couple of months.

15:09.046 --> 15:11.496
I came clean to your mother.

15:13.395 --> 15:17.433
I tried to end things
with Claire.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.159
I didn't know that,
by that point,

15:19.159 --> 15:24.164
she had some ex-spy
tailing us, taking photos.

15:24.164 --> 15:28.444
Needless to say,
when she pressed me to support

15:28.444 --> 15:32.932
a government contract
for one of her clients,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.657
I had no choice.

15:35.796 --> 15:38.247
Dad.

15:38.247 --> 15:42.976
It's a black mark
of my Senate record.

15:42.976 --> 15:46.152
I made one mistake
a very long time ago.

15:46.152 --> 15:48.464
Now it could not only ruin
your brother's career but--

15:48.464 --> 15:52.537
It's not your fault.
It's mine.

15:52.537 --> 15:54.470
Why would someone
send you these?

16:00.649 --> 16:04.653
You don't really work
in logistics, do you, Emma?

16:13.213 --> 16:16.147
How long have you been sober?

16:16.147 --> 16:20.151
Two years,
three weeks, and one day.

16:20.151 --> 16:22.291
Yeah, about eight years
too late, though.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.708
That's when you started
calling me, huh?

16:25.708 --> 16:28.711
At your two-year anniversary.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.575
I told you, I've changed.

17:11.892 --> 17:13.549
Doesn't make sense to me.

17:13.549 --> 17:14.964
- Microwaves.
- A hatchback.

17:14.964 --> 17:15.931
I still think--

17:15.931 --> 17:17.864
Bird, he's playing you.

17:17.864 --> 17:19.452
<i>All right? Just play the part.</i>

17:19.452 --> 17:20.729
Excuse me.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.284
Are we still talking about me?

17:24.284 --> 17:26.079
I know what I'm doing.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.218
Bird.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.084
Birdie.

17:34.915 --> 17:36.883
Oh, you want something done...

17:51.691 --> 17:55.212
<i>♪ Kick, rattle, and shake
like a rat in a cage ♪</i>

17:55.212 --> 17:59.008
<i>♪ Bang bang on the door,
time to come out and play ♪</i>

17:59.008 --> 18:00.631
<i>♪ If you can't keep up</i>

18:00.631 --> 18:03.082
<i>♪ It's the start of end</i>

18:03.082 --> 18:06.119
<i>♪ 3-2-1, let the games begin</i>

18:06.119 --> 18:09.847
<i>♪ Hold onto your tongue,
do whatever it takes ♪</i>

18:09.847 --> 18:13.471
<i>♪ Stare into the sun
and moves on the stage ♪</i>

18:13.471 --> 18:17.475
<i>♪ If you can't keep up,
it's the start of the end ♪</i>

18:17.475 --> 18:20.858
<i>♪ 3-2-1, let the games begin</i>

18:23.585 --> 18:26.346
Yeah.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.969
<i>♪ Let the games begin</i>

18:28.969 --> 18:30.523
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:30.523 --> 18:32.421
I know
you don't like post-modern,

18:32.421 --> 18:35.044
but I instantly thought of you.

18:35.044 --> 18:37.875
At least I thought of how happy
it would make both of us, yes?

18:41.050 --> 18:45.331
The Blenner painting is ready
for its new home.

18:45.331 --> 18:48.057
I will book the Vespertine
for the exchange.

18:48.057 --> 18:49.162
What?

18:49.162 --> 18:50.991
Yeah, the usual time.

18:50.991 --> 18:53.132
Sunday night at 10:00.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.271
Bye.

18:57.343 --> 18:59.655
There you are.

18:59.655 --> 19:01.140
Enjoying the view?

19:05.696 --> 19:07.180
Birdie,
do you hear me?

19:07.180 --> 19:08.216
I need help.

19:12.081 --> 19:13.462
There's the Blenner.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.018
Hi.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.054
Is everything okay,

19:19.054 --> 19:20.849
or are you just trying
to give me the slip?

19:22.920 --> 19:25.716
Do you know he doesn't even
think of this as a painting?

19:26.889 --> 19:30.341
Blenner thinks of this
as a--as a stage.

19:30.341 --> 19:33.655
And then he incorporates red
in his work for the first time.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.933
And it's like
an invitation to us

19:35.933 --> 19:40.420
to consider evolving
out of black and white.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.390
I missed hearing you talk
about art.

19:45.839 --> 19:47.772
Yeah, I miss
talking about it.

19:47.772 --> 19:50.223
And I can't wait to see how
you feel about the real one.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.260
What do you mean,
the real one?

19:52.260 --> 19:54.434
It's counterfeit.

19:54.434 --> 19:57.541
Look at the way
the light reflects off of it.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.129
60-year-old ink
would absorb more light.

20:01.510 --> 20:04.444
But I know that Abramov
bought the real Blenner

20:04.444 --> 20:05.583
three months ago.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.033
Oh, yeah, he may own it,

20:07.033 --> 20:08.621
but that's not it.

20:08.621 --> 20:10.105
It's a high-quality fake,
to be sure.

20:10.105 --> 20:11.210
That probably cost him 20K.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.074
But that's definitely not
the Selden I sold him.

20:14.074 --> 20:17.112
I mean, it is, but it isn't.

20:17.112 --> 20:19.252
Why would someone go
to all the expense

20:19.252 --> 20:20.736
of acquiring original art

20:20.736 --> 20:23.291
just to make
and display the fakes?

20:25.603 --> 20:28.227
And where are the real ones?

20:31.885 --> 20:33.059
Hey, Charlie.

20:33.059 --> 20:34.543
<i>Charlie, where are you?</i>

20:34.543 --> 20:36.545
Balcony. Balcony, now.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.561
Hello, again.

20:52.561 --> 20:53.838
Hello, hello.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.426
I trust you're
enjoying yourself.

20:55.426 --> 20:56.669
Oh, very much so.

20:56.669 --> 20:58.291
Although, I did just hear
somebody inside say

20:58.291 --> 20:59.568
they're out of vodka, so...

20:59.568 --> 21:01.260
Out of vodka--

21:01.260 --> 21:02.847
that's not possible.

21:07.335 --> 21:08.577
What are you doing?

21:08.577 --> 21:09.992
You said
there was no security,

21:09.992 --> 21:11.684
so I thought I'd just drop in
and grab the Blenner myself.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.306
There's no security
because the painting's fake.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.618
What?
Abramov said something

21:14.618 --> 21:16.482
about Vespertine Sunday.

21:16.482 --> 21:17.621
Vespertine?

21:17.621 --> 21:18.622
That's a small art gallery

21:18.622 --> 21:20.313
at the Felton Freeport.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.970
It's a tax haven.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.696
It's probably where
he keeps his real art.

21:23.696 --> 21:26.043
I have a locker there myself.

21:37.434 --> 21:38.918
You got my message.

21:41.886 --> 21:44.613
Two single malts, neat.

21:44.613 --> 21:46.166
I think you're gonna want one.

21:49.549 --> 21:52.518
Did you know about
Daddy Dearest?

21:52.518 --> 21:56.176
Or were you just as surprised
as I was?

21:56.176 --> 21:59.041
It's always the ones
you least expect.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.872
I'm not sure what's worse,
though, the secret affair

22:01.872 --> 22:05.807
or the fact that
the great Senator Hill

22:05.807 --> 22:08.188
compromised himself politically
for it.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.539
I'm just glad to know
I'm not the only one

22:13.539 --> 22:14.850
with daddy issues.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.369
Here you are, ladies.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.687
I guess we both could use
that drink.

22:25.930 --> 22:29.278
How did you find out?

22:29.278 --> 22:33.938
See, what's confusing for me
is you work hard

22:33.938 --> 22:36.216
to get out of a poor
Philly neighborhood,

22:36.216 --> 22:37.597
earn a full ride to Penn

22:37.597 --> 22:39.875
just so you can help
a bunch of criminals

22:39.875 --> 22:42.602
scale up their operation.

22:42.602 --> 22:46.192
For what, Daddy's love?

22:46.192 --> 22:48.021
Come on.

22:48.021 --> 22:49.437
You're not a gangster.

22:49.437 --> 22:50.990
You're nothing
like your father.

22:54.096 --> 22:57.306
People like you
and your family

22:57.306 --> 23:01.794
wrap themselves in this veil
of moral authority,

23:01.794 --> 23:03.623
pretending to be the good guys.

23:03.623 --> 23:05.522
But at the end of the day,

23:05.522 --> 23:10.872
cops, politicians, CIA,

23:10.872 --> 23:13.046
you're criminals just like me,

23:13.046 --> 23:17.292
willing to blur the lines of
morality whenever it suits you.

23:17.292 --> 23:21.538
I'm just glad I've got
the photos now to prove it.

23:21.538 --> 23:22.642
What do you want?

23:22.642 --> 23:24.403
Back off.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.476
If the Feds stay on me,

23:28.476 --> 23:32.480
if I feel any hint of your
investigation continuing,

23:32.480 --> 23:35.931
I will expose your family
for the frauds you really are.

23:37.726 --> 23:39.797
You see, Emma,

23:39.797 --> 23:42.455
unlike you,

23:42.455 --> 23:45.285
I know exactly who I am.

23:45.285 --> 23:46.942
And you're right.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.980
I am not my father.

23:49.980 --> 23:54.156
But I am my father's daughter.

23:54.156 --> 23:57.815
And you haven't even begun
to see what I'm capable of.

24:07.653 --> 24:09.758
Thanks for the drink.

24:20.528 --> 24:21.598
Oh, sorry.

24:21.598 --> 24:23.151
Thank you.
- All right, Mom.

24:23.151 --> 24:24.704
We gotta go back
to a "no food and drink" rule

24:24.704 --> 24:26.534
in the basement.
I invented
that rule, Birdie.

24:26.534 --> 24:27.880
Unbelievable.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.365
These rich people,
they just keep

24:30.365 --> 24:32.816
all this incredible art
locked away in the dark,

24:32.816 --> 24:34.024
never seen by anyone.

24:34.024 --> 24:36.026
Multimillion-dollar
business deals,

24:36.026 --> 24:37.476
all tax free.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.547
Late stage capitalism
at its finest.

24:39.547 --> 24:42.204
That place must be
like Fort Knox, huh?

24:42.204 --> 24:44.034
Yeah, I mean, it's basically
like a safety deposit box

24:44.034 --> 24:45.380
on steroids, right?

24:45.380 --> 24:47.624
Rotating security,
strict temperature controls.

24:47.624 --> 24:49.729
Only members are allowed
inside with the key card.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.354
Where'd you get that?

24:54.354 --> 24:56.529
What?
He was so distracted by you.

24:58.566 --> 25:01.638
Okay, so we slip in while
the deal is taking place.

25:01.638 --> 25:02.880
Create a diversion.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.089
A basic thirsty man shuffle.

25:05.089 --> 25:06.505
With a low-ball switch.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.748
Okay, but if we scan in
with that

25:08.748 --> 25:11.164
and it's Simon's name
on the log during the heist--

25:11.164 --> 25:12.511
Who cares about Simon?

25:15.548 --> 25:17.101
all: Don't answer that.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.727
Yeah?

25:21.727 --> 25:23.245
<i>We need to talk
about the Blenner.</i>

25:23.245 --> 25:25.696
<i>I have new intel. Same spot?</i>

25:25.696 --> 25:27.042
Yep.

25:29.079 --> 25:30.770
I got it. I'll be back.

25:39.986 --> 25:44.439
So what's your intel?

25:44.439 --> 25:46.303
They are closing
the Freeport tomorrow

25:46.303 --> 25:48.477
two hours before the exchange.

25:48.477 --> 25:52.792
Clearly, Abramov's guest
wants to remain a secret.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.967
So if nobody can get in
or out during that time,

25:54.967 --> 25:58.591
I don't think that my key card
will be of much help.

26:04.597 --> 26:08.290
I'm guessing Charlie lifted
this off me at the penthouse.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.396
So you're trying to stop us.

26:10.396 --> 26:12.881
I let you down before.

26:12.881 --> 26:14.434
I'm not gonna do it again.

26:15.746 --> 26:17.265
You want to help?

26:33.971 --> 26:35.110
Hey, guys.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.439
Mr. Norris, new piece?

26:53.439 --> 26:54.785
Any paperwork you need?

26:54.785 --> 26:55.993
Oh, hey, Regina.

26:55.993 --> 26:57.305
No, I'm just holding
on to a client's sculpture

26:57.305 --> 26:58.513
for a home reno.

26:58.513 --> 26:59.790
I'll have it out of here tomorrow.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.136
Lovely.

27:20.328 --> 27:21.570
Come on, man.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.711
If I get one more undelivered,
I'm fired.

27:23.711 --> 27:25.229
I'm fired.

27:25.229 --> 27:28.198
I tell you guys all the time,
no deliveries after 6:00.

27:28.198 --> 27:29.406
Hey, Richard, come on, man.

27:29.406 --> 27:31.166
That's only five minutes.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.548
What if it was your job?

27:35.101 --> 27:36.482
Last time.

27:52.878 --> 27:55.156
Evening, Mr. Abramov,
pleased to see you again.

27:55.156 --> 27:56.882
Always a pleasure.
Thank you for staying late.

27:56.882 --> 27:57.917
Of course.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.401
I have your articles
of provenance ready

27:59.401 --> 28:00.989
for Blenner's
"A Scarlet Introduction."

28:00.989 --> 28:05.580
Regina, your service,
like your tailoring,

28:05.580 --> 28:06.926
remains impeccable.

28:34.264 --> 28:35.748
So that's the doodle, huh?

28:35.748 --> 28:38.440
Yeah, original Erin Blenner.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.648
Market value $2 million.

28:39.648 --> 28:42.651
I will never understand
you art types.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.481
Mr. Willford,
as requested,

28:44.481 --> 28:46.863
we are keeping your piece
enclosed for safety.

28:46.863 --> 28:49.866
I'll now finalize the paperwork
for the transfer.

28:52.213 --> 28:53.317
Hey, you trust Simon

28:53.317 --> 28:54.905
to bring us the painting
after we do this?

28:54.905 --> 28:56.389
You don't think
he's just gonna disappear

28:56.389 --> 28:57.666
in the middle of the night
again?

28:57.666 --> 28:59.738
That was different,
and you know it.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.740
And he's serious
about wanting to reconcile.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.949
So, yes, I do trust him
to bring the painting back.

29:05.157 --> 29:07.055
All right.

29:07.055 --> 29:10.334
10 seconds till the EMP zaps
the security system.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.096
<i>Here we go.</i>

29:13.096 --> 29:17.238
<i>3, 2, 1.</i>

29:19.619 --> 29:21.760
System reboot. Five minutes.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.692
Get eyes on the hall
until it's back up.

29:23.692 --> 29:24.935
I'll check the vault.

29:38.811 --> 29:39.985
Thank you, Willford.

29:39.985 --> 29:41.676
And that's that.

29:41.676 --> 29:43.954
Your new pieces will now
be taken to your units.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.611
<i>All right,
it's showtime.</i>

29:47.475 --> 29:48.925
Pleasure doing business.

29:48.925 --> 29:50.650
<i>Fire detected.</i>

29:50.650 --> 29:52.204
<i>60 seconds.</i>
- We need to go.

29:52.204 --> 29:53.826
Come on. No, no, no.

29:53.826 --> 29:54.965
The system is rigged

29:54.965 --> 29:56.864
to suppress all oxygen
in the Freeport.

29:56.864 --> 29:59.659
Anyone still inside
will suffocate.

30:01.972 --> 30:03.871

30:40.010 --> 30:41.736
Four minutes until
the system's back online.

All right, let's see
what $2 million gets you.

31:00.789 --> 31:01.790
There's nothing in here.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.447
It's an address.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.251
Here goes nothing.

31:17.323 --> 31:18.911

When did you last go

32:12.861 --> 32:14.484
- Eh...
- Okay.

32:14.484 --> 32:16.141
I rest my case.
- Apologies, gentlemen.

32:16.141 --> 32:18.419
It seems a coffee pot decided
to have a meltdown.

32:18.419 --> 32:19.454
Everything's now in order

32:19.454 --> 32:21.008
if you'd like to come
back inside

32:21.008 --> 32:23.803
while we transfer your new
pieces into your lockers.

32:23.803 --> 32:25.529
Thank you.

32:25.529 --> 32:28.084
I think we can do this now.

32:33.123 --> 32:35.988
Nothing shady about a deal
at a fancy storage facility

32:35.988 --> 32:37.334
in the middle of the night.

32:42.857 --> 32:44.997
You are gonna love me.

32:46.861 --> 32:47.966
Who's that?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.312
Grigori Abramov.

32:49.312 --> 32:51.141
I went back to my Russian asset

32:51.141 --> 32:53.316
to shake him down
for some fresh intel.

32:53.316 --> 32:55.214
It seems like
the Russian cartel arranged

32:55.214 --> 32:58.321
a sit-down with Daphne
and Abramov twice.

32:58.321 --> 33:00.116
And she left both meetings pissed.

33:00.116 --> 33:01.462
He has something
that she wants.

33:01.462 --> 33:03.153
What is it?

33:03.153 --> 33:05.121
That's why I followed him
to find out.

33:05.121 --> 33:06.329
Good work.

33:06.329 --> 33:08.365
This guy right here
is Brad Willford.

33:08.365 --> 33:10.126
He works for American Armory.

33:10.126 --> 33:12.473
They manufacture
military-grade weapons.

33:12.473 --> 33:13.922
He makes 100K,

33:13.922 --> 33:15.338
but he owns his place
in Great Falls

33:15.338 --> 33:17.478
and has a bungalow in Belize.

33:17.478 --> 33:19.928
It sounds like someone's got
a side hustle with the Russian.

33:19.928 --> 33:22.138
Daphne wants in
on the gun trade.

33:22.138 --> 33:25.727
A lot of agencies are gonna be
very interested in this.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.872
This is great.

33:35.151 --> 33:36.600
How'd it go
at the Freeport?

33:36.600 --> 33:38.257
Yeah, none the wiser.

33:41.881 --> 33:43.573
Is this the real one?

33:43.573 --> 33:44.643
Birdie.

33:48.612 --> 33:49.579
Yeah.

33:50.718 --> 33:52.789
Yeah, it's real.

33:52.789 --> 33:53.755
Okay.

33:58.070 --> 34:01.142
Um, why did you leave
the way you did?

34:06.803 --> 34:08.425
You were never that guy.

34:10.910 --> 34:13.327
Maybe you should ask
your father about that.

34:15.018 --> 34:16.088
Bird?

34:17.331 --> 34:19.298
Help me out with this.

34:19.298 --> 34:21.473
- Yeah, sure, I'll just, uh--
- Yeah.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.008
Hey, Bird.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.645
God, she's beautiful.

34:55.645 --> 34:57.095
Smart too.

34:58.613 --> 35:00.339
Hey, how long you been signing?

35:01.789 --> 35:05.241
Oh, uh, I've just been
taking classes online.

35:05.241 --> 35:08.451
I'm clearly not fluent,
but I'm working on it.

35:09.383 --> 35:12.110
Uh, just tell Birdie bye.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.180
Sure you're gonna
see her again.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.837
So tell her yourself.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.324
Right.

38:07.664 --> 38:08.838
How's it going?

38:11.392 --> 38:12.566
Huh.

38:15.569 --> 38:17.087
I'm trying, Dad.

38:18.537 --> 38:19.676
I really am.

38:21.644 --> 38:22.783
If I do my job,

38:22.783 --> 38:24.509
David's campaign,
your legacy,

38:24.509 --> 38:26.994
everything this family's
worked for is destroyed.

38:28.858 --> 38:31.170
But if I back off,
the bad guys win.

38:34.035 --> 38:36.659
You've always been
clear-eyed.

38:36.659 --> 38:38.971
Even as a little girl,
things were either

38:38.971 --> 38:42.078
good or bad, black or white.

38:42.078 --> 38:45.323
That's why you would have made
a terrible politician.

38:45.323 --> 38:49.050
In politics,
there is no black and white,

38:49.050 --> 38:51.708
just gray.

38:51.708 --> 38:55.678
So in my experience,
there is another answer.

38:55.678 --> 38:57.576
You just haven't found it yet.

39:06.205 --> 39:07.379
Guns.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.898
Yeah.

39:08.898 --> 39:10.244
That's classic Daphne.

39:10.244 --> 39:11.521
Just when you think
she's the worst,

39:11.521 --> 39:13.074
she outdoes herself.

39:13.074 --> 39:14.593
I mean, if the Feds find out
about this one,

39:14.593 --> 39:16.250
they're definitely
taking us down with her.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.393
Speaking of Feds.

39:31.438 --> 39:32.335
Hey.

39:33.232 --> 39:34.372
Hey.

39:36.753 --> 39:38.824
I thought you didn't want
to see me again.

39:40.481 --> 39:42.103
How was Delaware?

39:53.149 --> 39:54.978
Look.
I'm not here to arrest you.

39:54.978 --> 39:56.739
I just want to talk.

39:56.739 --> 39:58.430
And what
are we talking about?

39:59.776 --> 40:01.399
You and Daphne.

40:03.780 --> 40:04.988
What about her?

40:04.988 --> 40:06.645
Help me take her down.

40:11.719 --> 40:13.721
Now you want me
to be a criminal.

40:15.551 --> 40:16.759
What--what happened to

40:16.759 --> 40:19.451
"as black and white
as it gets"?

40:20.728 --> 40:22.454
Why should I help you
with this?

40:22.454 --> 40:25.284
Because like it or not,
we need each other.

40:27.355 --> 40:29.496
If you come work for me
as my asset,

40:29.496 --> 40:32.291
I'll protect your family while
you help me protect mine.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.506
Yeah, okay.

40:39.506 --> 40:40.990
But Daphne's gotten into

40:40.990 --> 40:42.681
some pretty heavy stuff.

40:42.681 --> 40:44.925
So if I do this for you,

40:44.925 --> 40:47.203
you're not gonna like me
very much.

40:47.203 --> 40:48.756
Well, I kind of
don't like you now,

40:48.756 --> 40:51.863
so I guess
there's nothing to lose.

41:06.084 --> 41:09.708
The painting is, uh,
much smaller than I imagined.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.330
The painting is in the truck.

41:11.330 --> 41:15.058
That is the location
of $2 million worth

41:15.058 --> 41:17.336
of unregistered firearms,

41:17.336 --> 41:21.030
plus the contact information
for Brad Willford,

41:21.030 --> 41:22.687
who supplied them.

41:22.687 --> 41:23.998
Dealing drugs, dealing arms,

41:23.998 --> 41:26.518
that is an ambitious
new line of work.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.900
Oh, Charlie,
you shouldn't have.

41:30.557 --> 41:34.215
I thought
Abramov was the key, but you--

41:34.215 --> 41:36.183
you just opened the damn door.

41:36.183 --> 41:39.013
You know,
I couldn't stop thinking,

41:39.013 --> 41:41.878
all these masterpieces

41:41.878 --> 41:46.089
just locked away in the dark...

41:47.505 --> 41:48.436
Not being viewed the way

41:48.436 --> 41:50.853
they really deserve to be seen.

41:52.820 --> 41:57.066
You know I'm capable
of so much more.

41:57.066 --> 41:58.550
And I know what you want.

42:00.932 --> 42:02.347
Do you?

42:02.347 --> 42:05.419
You want the Maguire throne.

42:05.419 --> 42:08.767
I help you get it,
you and I are truly square.

42:11.287 --> 42:14.048
Let me show you
what I can really do.
