00:01.750 --> 00:03.420
Dre: Birthdays.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.120
They're more
than just the one day

00:05.120 --> 00:07.460
people in bad marriages
get to have sex

00:07.460 --> 00:10.460
or an excuse to reach out
to an ex on Facebook.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.000
They're how
we measure milestones.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.790
But if you're black in America,

00:14.790 --> 00:17.540
each birthday is
a much bigger deal.

00:17.540 --> 00:21.920
Black men live a full 7 years
less than the national average.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.500
7...years.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.580
That's like missing the entire
run of "Designing Women"

00:27.580 --> 00:30.040
or six Bulls championships

00:30.040 --> 00:32.170
and the one time
the Cavs got lucky.

00:32.170 --> 00:34.790
Stress, hypertension,

00:34.790 --> 00:37.250
heart disease, rap beefs.

00:37.250 --> 00:39.000
It takes
an exceptional black man

00:39.000 --> 00:41.750
to make it all the way to 65 --

00:41.750 --> 00:42.790
or this one.

00:42.790 --> 00:43.790
All: Oh!

00:43.790 --> 00:45.250
That's right!

00:45.250 --> 00:47.420
It's my birthday.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.000
No one's gonna ask where
Pops got this sword from?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.290
Uh, no.

00:51.290 --> 00:52.620
You better not.

00:57.710 --> 00:59.880
Everybody, drink up,

00:59.880 --> 01:03.460
because we are
celebrating.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.000
-Yes.
-Thank you, Pops. No.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.830
So now it's illegal to serve
your teenage grandson champagne?

01:07.830 --> 01:10.330
I'm more of a Perrier
with a splash of pink lemonade

01:10.330 --> 01:11.460
kind of guy
anyway.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.290
Oh, come on, Junior.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.250
I beat the odds, son.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.620
I made it to 65.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.620
We talkin' about
white retirement age.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.670
Now, you know they set
the age of Social Security at 65

01:22.670 --> 01:24.500
so they wouldn't have to pay us,
son. You know that.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.080
'Cause the white man
did not want

01:26.080 --> 01:28.080
Earl Johnson
to live this long.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.040
-Neither did I.
-Okay.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.330
For my birthday,

01:31.330 --> 01:33.620
you would always sleep in late
and go to bed early

01:33.620 --> 01:34.960
so you didn't see me.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.080
That's exactly
what you do on my birthday.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.420
This isn't
about me, son.
No, it's about me.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.920
Because I have done
something

01:41.920 --> 01:43.790
that no other black man
has ever done.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.210
Live 'til you're 65?

01:46.210 --> 01:47.620
Yes.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.790
Now, name one black man
older than me.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.420
I can't believe
I'm drawing a blank.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.040
There's -- There's gotta be
at least one.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.250
Okay...

01:56.250 --> 01:58.170
Nick Cannon!
No. N-No.
No.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.250
-Oh! DMX! No.
-Jaleel White.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.830
No, wait?
Why is this so hard?
I don't know.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.170
Smokey:
Earl Johnson!

02:04.380 --> 02:05.880
Man!

02:08.790 --> 02:10.040

02:10.040 --> 02:11.670
Look at you, man!

02:11.670 --> 02:13.380
Hey, y'all.
This is my man Smokey.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.880
Smokey, how the hell
you get in my house, man?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.420
The doors
were locked.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.290
Oh, you just got a single-bolt
retractable on there. It's easy.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.210
Ain't a house been built
that Smokey can't get into.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.330
Ain't that right?

02:24.330 --> 02:26.960
I think
I hear the baby.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.420
How do you guys
know each other?

02:28.420 --> 02:29.960
You here

all the questions?

02:31.710 --> 02:32.880
You

02:32.880 --> 02:35.000
What?
I'm 17.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.750
That's still
not a "No."

02:36.750 --> 02:38.330
Hey, he's cool,
Smokey.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.790
What you say we get out of here

It's 8:30

02:41.460 --> 02:44.380
I don't give a damn.
I just turned 65.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.790
I never have to give
a damn ever again!

02:46.790 --> 02:48.330
So, all this time,
you've been giving a damn?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.330
Come on,
let's go, Smokey.
All right.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.750
Hey, really nice house
you got here.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.330
You want to stop
casing the joint, man?

02:55.330 --> 02:57.120
I'm not doing nothing.
I'm just saying.

his childhood like?

03:13.790 --> 03:15.210
Who are his friends?

03:15.210 --> 03:17.330
Why does he
still own a pager?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.790
That's my question.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.460
Maybe we should throw him
a surprise party!

03:23.460 --> 03:25.500
Come on, Dad,
don't you think it'd be fun

I'm gonna have
nothing to do with it,

dealing with Pops,

you'll only
get burned.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.420

out of it.

Uh, I will.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.750

the same name,

No. No, Ruby,
it's not.

I created this habit

What, this Saturday, huh?
Mm-hmm.

Ohh. Wow.

One A&W Root Beer float,

two straws.

I am not doing that
with you.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.790
It's weird!

about that car.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.620
He -- He loved that car
more than he loved me.

08:36.620 --> 08:40.080

19:11.040 --> 19:13.210
Both: Uh-huh.
Okay.

19:13.210 --> 19:16.290

don't have enough energy.

asked this earlier,

19:52.580 --> 19:53.880
but who's Shonda Rhimes?

You have
got to be kidding me.

Dre: So, I took Bow's advice
to heart
