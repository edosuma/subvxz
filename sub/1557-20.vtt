16:03.250 --> 16:04.490
Let's do this!

16:05.620 --> 16:06.690
I can't do this.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.790
Me either.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.690
Ah!
We're almost 50!

16:13.230 --> 16:14.590
[ Claire sighs ]

16:14.630 --> 16:17.560
The ride home,
while less than a mile long,

16:17.600 --> 16:18.460
was interminable.

16:18.470 --> 16:20.540
Whatever bridges
had been built were burned,

16:20.570 --> 16:21.540
like my fish was,

16:21.570 --> 16:23.270
which is why red wine was a --

16:23.310 --> 16:25.740
Hey, honey, you don't
have to defend yourself.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.730
When it comes to wine,
this woman doesn't see color.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.300
She'll drink whatever's
put in front of her.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.930
Oh, great.

16:32.930 --> 16:32.940
They put lights on it.
[ Amber scoffs ]
Oh, great.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.760
They put lights on it.
[ Amber scoffs ]

16:35.550 --> 16:37.250
Stop the car.

16:40.020 --> 16:41.990
We have to tear that thing down.
They're right.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.360
It's the only way.

16:43.510 --> 16:46.010
- What?
- Now you're talking!

16:46.040 --> 16:47.180
There's the girl

16:47.210 --> 16:48.440
that I occasionally
have sex dreams about.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.080
Yeah, that's true.
He told me.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.880
- No, no, no. This is crazy.
- Claire: Yes.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.680
- Don't do this.
- How many months do you want to spend

16:54.720 --> 16:57.320
trying to fight through
some bureaucratic red tape

16:57.350 --> 16:58.750
to get that thing taken down

16:58.790 --> 17:00.420
- only to be told there's
nothing we can do? - Oh, no.

17:00.460 --> 17:01.720
Stay in the car.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.860
Stay in the car!

17:05.329 --> 17:07.329
- What do we do?
- Here, take that. Put it around.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.960
- Through the loop.
- Yeah, I do this.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.470
Tie it down.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
It's too short.
I got to back the truck up.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.400
- No!
- No!

17:17.540 --> 17:19.069
Phil, what are you doing?
Come on. Open the door.

17:19.109 --> 17:20.380
- I can't allow this to happen!
- Come on, man.

17:20.410 --> 17:21.609
I'm a respected member
of the community!

17:21.839 --> 17:22.990
I'm on bus benches!

17:22.990 --> 17:25.290
- You're such a boy scout!
- Open the door. Open the door.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.530
I want that thing gone as much
as anyone, but not like this.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.760
I'm gonna take this truck.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.230
I'm gonna go get some fro-yo.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.500
I suggest you use the walk home
to calm down.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.930
Once you have,
you're gonna thank me.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.390
Claire: Phil. Oh, my god!
You're going back--

17:38.570 --> 17:39.840
Thank you!
[ Gasps ]

17:39.870 --> 17:42.070
Phil: I thought I was in drive!

17:44.810 --> 17:46.280
Phil!

17:46.310 --> 17:48.050
Phil!

17:49.010 --> 17:50.410
We were awesome tonight, guys.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.150
Do you think we're good enough
to take on the lesbians?

17:52.180 --> 17:53.950
Oh, god, no.
[ Chuckles ]

17:54.480 --> 17:56.180
One more round on me.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.520
[ Chuckles ]

17:58.960 --> 18:00.060
Good match, Martin.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.460
Oh. You too, Jay.
Congratulations.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.600
Thanks.

18:04.630 --> 18:05.770
I hope I didn't
throw off your game at all.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.400
No. That's all me.
I do that.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.900
I get ahead of myself.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.620
Create expectations,
build them up.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.340
Don't worry about me.
I'm going to see a life coach.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.790
It is going
to change everything.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.230
Well, listen, I wasn't feeling
great about myself tonight,

18:19.260 --> 18:20.700
and you helped get me
out of that funk.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.910
And it wouldn't be right

18:22.950 --> 18:25.150
for me to let you
leave feeling bad.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.850
Oh.
You're a great guy,

18:26.890 --> 18:30.250
and the reason
I turned you down is because...

18:30.290 --> 18:31.420
[ Chuckles ]

18:32.410 --> 18:35.370
It's much harder
to say out loud than I thought.

18:35.410 --> 18:36.540
I'm...

18:38.680 --> 18:40.180
I'm not gay.

18:40.610 --> 18:41.740
You're straight?

18:41.770 --> 18:42.840
Who's what?
What's happening?

18:42.870 --> 18:44.710
Whoa, it feels good
to finally tell someone.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.120
For four hours,

18:46.150 --> 18:47.750
I've been living in fear
that I'd be found out.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.450
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

18:53.060 --> 18:55.020
Right.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.030
Jay, thank you
for admitting that.

18:57.060 --> 18:59.160
You are a real class act.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.760
Disqualified!

19:00.800 --> 19:01.960
You lose!

19:02.000 --> 19:03.470
Give me that! That's mine!
Oh, my god!

19:03.500 --> 19:04.930
Oh, my god, champions!
[ Laughter ]

19:04.970 --> 19:05.970
We're champions again!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.300
Let me out!
Oh, my god!

19:08.340 --> 19:09.340
Guess what, Jay.

19:09.370 --> 19:11.240
You're my new archrival.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.210
[ Cheering ]

19:13.240 --> 19:14.440
Oh, my god!

19:15.340 --> 19:16.940
I feel terrible.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.070
[ Chuckles ] - You're too good, boy scout.
[ Laughing ] - Yeah.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.590
That's why you need
people like us around.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.990
Admit it --
You're happy it's gone.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.160
I'm happy it's gone,
but it's weird we're out here

19:25.190 --> 19:26.960
instead of inside
with the lights off.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.320
It's called
hiding in plain sight.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.830
We just sit here and act
like we got nothing to hide,

19:31.870 --> 19:34.500
and they won't suspect a thing.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.940
Folks, I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.910
Someone said they heard a big
truck run over that statue.

19:40.190 --> 19:42.450
What? Well, we wouldn't know
anything about that

19:42.460 --> 19:43.860
because we were at dinner.

19:43.890 --> 19:44.920
Mind if I take a look
at your truck?

19:44.960 --> 19:45.830
Hey, Buddy.

19:45.940 --> 19:47.300
Oh, don't call a cop "buddy."
They hate that.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.380
No, that's his name.
I sold him a condo.

19:49.410 --> 19:51.470
- Phil?
- Yeah, Buddy. [ Chuckles ]

19:51.510 --> 19:54.240
The four of us were at dinner.
I can vouch for it.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.450
If you're looking
to solve a crime,

19:55.480 --> 19:57.210
this one here
had red wine with fish.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.220
Oh, I did. I did.
[ Laughter ]

19:59.250 --> 20:01.480
Sorry to bother you.
You folks have a good night.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.550
You too.
[ Chuckles ]

20:05.060 --> 20:06.660
No more boy scout.

20:06.690 --> 20:09.230
Looks like you're sleeping
with an outlaw tonight.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.490
Yes.
[ Amber chuckles ]

20:11.090 --> 20:12.260
Uh, we're in.

20:12.290 --> 20:13.420
Oh...

20:13.460 --> 20:14.920
No, no, I was talking to Claire.
Yeah.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.890
Are you saying
you're not attracted to us?

20:16.930 --> 20:19.430
- No, no, no...
- No, no, no...

20:19.460 --> 20:20.740
- No.
- No.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.230
It's unbelievable.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.210
Mom and dad are sitting outside

20:27.240 --> 20:28.780
with the neighbors
they used to hate

20:28.810 --> 20:31.010
yukking it up
like they're all best friends.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.240
And why?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.540
Because there's wine?

20:33.560 --> 20:35.560
No.
Because of art.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.260
That statue that was so offensive
provoked a conversation.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.090
That's what art does.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.520
- It brings people together.
- Even if it's gross?

20:43.540 --> 20:46.040
One person's gross is
another person's beautiful.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.070
Wow.
That's really powerful.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.700
Do you think that this
could bring people together?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.720
It's a self portrait of
"my junk."

20:53.250 --> 20:54.350
Never speak to me again.

20:55.010 --> 20:56.010
Hypocrite!
