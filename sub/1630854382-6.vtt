00:00.734 --> 00:02.336
<i>Back in the '80s,
my family loved Halloween.</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:06.074
<i>The crazy costumes,
the treats, the tricks.</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:07.875
<i>But since we were all older</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:09.643
<i>and had a new baby
in the house,</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:12.813
<i>this year was on track
to be more like any other day.</i>

00:12.946 --> 00:15.483
Oh, this <i>Lost Boys</i> movie
is entirely too scary.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.519
I mean, who in their right mind
moves to Northern California?

00:18.652 --> 00:20.454
Okay, let's just focus
on the movie.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.290
Blood-sucking
immortal creatures of the night

00:22.423 --> 00:24.158
are hell-bent on hanging out
with high schoolers.

00:24.992 --> 00:25.993
It has flaws.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.562
I would <i>love</i>
to be a vampire. Oh!

00:28.696 --> 00:30.731
Staying young with you forever?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.267
That is every mother's dream!
And I presume every son's.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.603
Yeah. Dreams. We all have 'em.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.505
The Halloween war is on!

00:37.638 --> 00:38.839
I know I shouldn't,
but... what?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.474
As you know,

00:40.608 --> 00:43.711
the Kremps have placed
a family of skeletons
on their lawn

00:43.844 --> 00:45.513
as a direct challenge to us.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.348
I think that's just
Ginzy's lame attempt

00:47.481 --> 00:49.016
at a playful
holiday decoration.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.819
It is clearly a game
of neighborhood
one-ups-manship.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.256
I will not allow our family
to be out Halloween-ed!

00:55.389 --> 00:58.226
I guess we could string some
lights together, and, uh--

00:58.359 --> 01:00.694
Oh, maybe get one of those
giant Hefty bags

01:00.828 --> 01:03.030
shaped like a pumpkin
that you fill with leaves.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.100
So, fun,
but you get a chore done.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.903
I'm talking about
celebrating the way
Americans are supposed to--:

01:10.037 --> 01:13.907
with a front-yard deathscape
that will haunt children's
dreams into adulthood.

01:14.041 --> 01:17.545
My sweet boy wants
to take the neighbors down
by outshining them.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.080
I raised you so well.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.415
I'm your favorite child.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.817
Now, to the street
to see my handiwork in action!

01:25.786 --> 01:27.255
Let the nightmares begin!

01:27.388 --> 01:29.290
I love it.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.693
Ginzy's sad skeletons
are already hanging
their heads in shame.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.528
Undead JTP!

01:34.662 --> 01:36.530
Undead JTP.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.967
You are murderous
ice-cream men! Act like it!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.769
I know it's too late
to ask this,

01:41.902 --> 01:43.571
but you couldn't have
just done this by yourself?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.273
Yeah, and why aren't <i>you</i>
in costume?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.774
We let him pour
raspberry syrup all over us,

01:46.907 --> 01:48.075
and that's the question
you're asking?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.110
I gotta admit,
this is impressive.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.479
Where did you even get
an ice-cream truck?

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
Funny story.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.149
The real ice-cream man
is in jail for a reason

01:55.283 --> 01:56.650
too unspeakable
to say out loud.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.252
How is that a funny story?

01:58.386 --> 02:01.755
Funny part is I got it
at a police auction
for 87 bucks!

02:01.889 --> 02:04.358
I think Andy needs
more blood on his face.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.427
- May I?
- Good call.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.728
Andy, let my mother sauce you.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.096
Oh, no, I don't think
that's something that--

02:09.230 --> 02:11.064
Okay.
Oh, she's already started.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.500
Yes. Yeah. That's better.
Mama, sauce the rest of them.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.934
- On it.
- O-kay!

02:14.067 --> 02:15.169
- Happy to help!
- I think we got it.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.537
- Uh-huh. Whoa.
- Yep.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.138
Oh, right in the mouth.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.140
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪</i>

02:20.274 --> 02:22.843
<i>♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say ♪</i>

02:26.013 --> 02:27.581
<i>♪ I don't know the future ♪</i>

02:27.715 --> 02:31.285
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
Clearer every day ♪</i>

02:31.419 --> 02:33.721
<i>It was
the day before Halloween,
1980-something,</i>

02:33.854 --> 02:35.623
<i>and Geoff and Erica
were discovering</i>

02:35.756 --> 02:37.258
<i>that they had different
parenting styles.</i>

02:38.659 --> 02:39.960
Uhp. There's the dinner bell.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.629
Time for Muriel's bottle.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.397
Sha-up!
Sleeping mama.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.799
Sorry, my slumbering sweetie.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.336
I'm just really excited to get
a little Q-T with <i>my</i> cutie.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.504
Shut up! I'll kill you.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.273
I'll kill all you.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.874
<i>The only problem
for Geoff was</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:56.344
<i>quality time with his daughter
was hard to come by.</i>

02:56.477 --> 02:59.012
Oh, look, it's my
ever-present mother-in-law

02:59.146 --> 03:01.014
who's beaten me
to my daughter... again.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.483
She was fussy,

03:02.616 --> 03:04.652
so I swooped in
to take care of it.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.388
You were seven seconds
critically late.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.523
You could have starved because
Daddy doesn't care about you

03:09.657 --> 03:10.824
as much as I do.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.560
Okay, I think that's
a tad bit unfair.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.428
And how did you know
she was fussy?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.730
Oh, I have a separate
military-grade monitor.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.399
It picks up everything.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.800
Even when a certain someone

03:19.933 --> 03:22.169
is singing "Macho Man"
in the shower.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.837
The beat is good to scrub to.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.873
And wait. You're monitoring
our monitoring?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.041
That's what a good granny does:

03:28.175 --> 03:29.543
parent quality control.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.778
I think we're doing
pretty okay.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.580
Oh, silly Geoffrey.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.382
That's because
I'm always around.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.084
You can't drop the ball
if I never throw it to you.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.619
But it's not <i>your</i> ball.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.256
Oh, it is because I made
the ball that made <i>this</i> ball.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.791
You know what? I'm just
gonna remove your monitor.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.626
Go ahead. I have many backups.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.094
- Where?
- Nowhere.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.796
Everywhere.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.998
Just know Big Blonde
is always watching.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.633
And <i>you</i> just know
that that's my daughter

03:52.766 --> 03:54.034
and I would like
to burp her now.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.703
Ooh. I already started.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.271
And I would
hand her over to you,

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
but I'm doing it perfectly.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.641
Oh!

04:00.774 --> 04:03.210
That is the sweet smell
of success,

04:03.344 --> 04:04.612
and the milk of your lady

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
who was fortified
by the milk of me.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.616
Legacy milk. I get it.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.818
Maybe you can see her
after her nap.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.052
Unless I get there first,

04:12.185 --> 04:12.920
which I will, because,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.087
as we've established,

04:14.221 --> 04:16.290
I am a force
to be reckoned with.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.025
<i>While Geoff
was feeling down,</i>

04:18.158 --> 04:20.227
<i>my Halloween plans
were up in the air.</i>

04:20.361 --> 04:21.895
Hello, neighbor.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.931
Where are you headed
this All Hallows' Eve?

04:24.064 --> 04:27.935
Perhaps to go trick-or-treating
with your becostumed <i>amigos?</i>

04:28.068 --> 04:31.672
You should know that
you are still teensy enough
to get candy without judgment.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.575
And you should know
I'm uncomfortable
with you assessing my body.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.676
I hear that more than I should.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.810
And I'm not going out.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.446
I don't have
a social life anymore

04:38.579 --> 04:39.680
since all my friends
went off to college.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.114
Oh, goodness!

04:41.248 --> 04:43.684
My burble and chatter
has opened up some deep wounds.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.252
It's fine.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.454
I'm just gonna hang here
and eat this entire bowl
of Mounds.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.556
Holy coconut delights!

04:48.689 --> 04:51.892
Mounds are a delicious treat,
but only in moderation.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.261
You must really be hurting
and lonely.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.529
Okay. Take it easy.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.965
Dave Kim did invite me
to visit him in New York.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.901
But your dance card
is painfully empty.
Why didn't you accept?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.269
Oh, no reason.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.737
New York City
traffic scares me.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.672
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

05:04.805 --> 05:05.806
The traffic is too much for me.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.408
Son, please,
play to the back row.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.309
I don't want
to drive alone, okay?

05:09.443 --> 05:11.011
The taxis zip by too fast,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.746
and the pedestrians
just step into the street

05:12.880 --> 05:14.482
with no regard
for the "Don't Walk" sign!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.917
And then they yell,
"Hey! I'm walkin' here!"

05:17.050 --> 05:18.786
The city does bring out
the worst in us,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.854
but great news,
I can give you a ride.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.122
<i>You're</i> going to New York?

05:22.255 --> 05:24.692
It's the annual Prince
impersonator competition,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.627
-"Prince-o-ween"!
- That can't be right.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.796
I didn't come up with it.
But I'm gonna dominate it.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.498
That's why I'm here.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.633
I'm gonna borrow a pair
of sparkly purple boots
from your mom.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.002
She is a generous,
big-footed lady.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.904
She can clomp
with the best of 'em.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.207
Adam! I need all
your money and coins!

05:40.340 --> 05:43.010
I blew through my budget
on fake gravestones

05:43.143 --> 05:46.179
with comedic epitaphs
like "Noah Scape"
and "Barry D. Alive."

05:46.313 --> 05:49.717
Fun! It's a reminder that
death comes for us all,
but in a silly way.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.018
Bar, why are you
doing this again?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.754
To shame our neighbors
and haunt the innocent.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.823
Why do I have to
keep explaining this?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.925
Yeah,
I'll take that ride, Mr. G.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.861
Huzzah! A companion
on the road to the big city!

06:00.994 --> 06:03.330
Looks like my mixtape
"Jams Just for John"

06:03.464 --> 06:04.898
is gonna break in
some new ears!

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
- I'm now wavering.
- Huzzah!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.168
<i>As I was
hitting the road,</i>

06:08.301 --> 06:10.203
<i>Geoff was trying
not to hit the roof</i>

06:10.337 --> 06:12.540
<i>over my mom's
aggressive grandparenting.</i>

06:12.673 --> 06:14.675
Honey, how long you gonna be?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.209
Until all the hot water
is gone.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.811
But I really need
to talk to you.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.180
Geoff, this is the first shower
I've had in a week.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.584
I need to wash
the spit-up, barf,
and baby yak off my body.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.752
Aren't those the same thing?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.421
Yes. No. Maybe?

06:27.555 --> 06:29.690
Look, I just need to
listen to the sound of
the water now, please.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.059
But your mom refuses to give me
a second with Muriel.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.562
Oh, you mean so we can
take quiet showers,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.063
and showers with no talking,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.598
and shower
with no other people
in the room?

06:37.731 --> 06:40.067
I get it. She's a huge help,
which is great for you,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.202
but I feel completely
cut out of my child's life.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.804
I don't know
what to tell you, homie.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.707
Maybe find some time
during the day
when she's not around?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.208
You mean like
when your mom's asleep?

06:48.341 --> 06:49.777
Sure!

06:49.910 --> 06:52.079
That seems like an answer
that would send you
on your way.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.882
<i>And so
Geoff took Erica's
dismissive advice</i>

06:55.015 --> 06:56.750
<i>and found a time to be
with his daughter alone:</i>

06:58.218 --> 06:58.886
<i>4:00 a.m.</i>

07:03.423 --> 07:04.625
- Gah!
- Looking for someone?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.226
Why are you up at this hour?

07:06.359 --> 07:07.895
I sensed something was wrong.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.597
A grandmother always knows.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.798
That's not an expression.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.066
Muriel's jammies
would beg to differ.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.503
Oh, my God. Okay.
No more bedazzling the baby.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.637
And I want to hold her.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.771
Yeah, now's not a good time.

07:17.905 --> 07:18.839
But <i>you're</i> holding her.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.741
Shh! You're upsetting her.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.610
And me.
I think it's best you leave.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.977
Oh, I'm gonna leave, all right.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.747
Erica, pack a bag

07:26.880 --> 07:28.916
because tomorrow
I'm spending alone time
with our daughter at the beach!

07:30.450 --> 07:32.252
I guess we can discuss it
when you're conscious

07:32.385 --> 07:34.421
and not spread out
like a starfish.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.189
How am I supposed to
get back in there?

07:36.323 --> 07:37.991
<i>As Geoff
was determined
to head out of town,</i>

07:38.125 --> 07:40.093
<i>I had arrived in the big city.</i>

07:40.227 --> 07:43.797
Adam! Baby!
Welcome to the West Village!

07:43.931 --> 07:44.932
Mwah! Mwah!

07:45.065 --> 07:47.635
Whoa
So unexpected and European!

07:47.768 --> 07:50.504
You know it.
DKNY is now international.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.841
DKNY? Donna Karan's ready-wear
line for today's smart set?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.743
Yup, and it's kind of
my moniker, baby.

07:55.876 --> 07:56.744
Get the hell in here, baby.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.679
You say "baby" an awful lot.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.080
I'm just saying how I feel.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.116
And how I feel is
happy to see you, baby.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.118
Whoa! Is your roommate a DJ?

08:05.252 --> 08:06.587
Those turntables are mine.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.956
You know how I like to drop
a funky beat every so often.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.991
Like when you play
the French horn?

08:11.124 --> 08:13.727
Oh, my God!
Shared history! Hilarious.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.028
Let me introduce you
to the gang.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.098
Tamsin, Brett, Fitz,
meet Adam F. Goldberg.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.366
Whoa, hey.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.569
Make some room for you.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.503
Brett caught some mouth!

08:23.637 --> 08:25.272
- Heh.
- You guys ready to eat?

08:25.405 --> 08:27.675
Nice! What are we thinking?
Some pizza?

08:27.808 --> 08:28.876
Classic New York 'za?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.613
I told you he was funny.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.115
We're going to an
Ethiopian place
we've grown quite fond of.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.483
Ethiopia?

08:36.617 --> 08:37.851
Sounds familiar,

08:37.985 --> 08:39.853
but my brother
threw my globe
at a bird's nest.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.054
It's amazing!

08:41.188 --> 08:42.890
You sit on the floor
and you pick up

08:43.023 --> 08:45.258
this special spongy bread
with your hands.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.994
Or we walk across the street

08:47.127 --> 08:48.528
to that novelty
hamburger place.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.863
Burger, Comedy and Magic?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.131
Check, check, and check.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.399
I don't eat meat.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.901
Oh, my God.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.002
There's, like, nothing left.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.403
Fruits and vegetables.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.338
Oh, just like the mighty...

08:58.471 --> 09:00.273
koala bear from your country.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.943
Adam, she's not Australian.
She's from the UK.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.012
Sorry.
I have Australia on the brain.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.546
I just re-watched
<i>Crocodile Dundee.</i>

09:06.680 --> 09:08.015
Ah, I love <i>Croc Dundee.</i>

09:08.148 --> 09:10.217
Awesome!
Looks like me and Fitz
have a lot in common.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.985
I like it ironically,
of course.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.154
At best it's an embarrassment
to an entire continent.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.556
Sure.
That's one way to like it.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.358
What about you, Brett?
What do you hate?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.393
Corporate America.

09:20.527 --> 09:23.631
It's exploiting our workforce
all to worship at the altar
of the almighty dollar.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.700
And you took my question
seriously. Oh for three.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.201
Tell you what,

09:28.335 --> 09:29.569
why don't we all change
into our costumes and head out?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.739
Now we're talking!
Let's do this!

09:31.872 --> 09:34.541
<i>Yep,
I wasn't in a groove
with Dave Kim's new friends.</i>

09:34.675 --> 09:36.209
<i>But once we were all
in our Halloween costumes,</i>

09:36.343 --> 09:38.045
<i>I was sure it'd all
be smoothed out.</i>

09:38.178 --> 09:39.747
<i>But there was this wrinkle.</i>

09:39.880 --> 09:42.015
Dude, when you said
you were going as Leonardo,

09:42.149 --> 09:43.917
I assumed you meant
the Ninja Turtle!

09:44.051 --> 09:45.653
No, I-I'm getting that.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.155
But what I'm not getting,
Dave Kim, is who
<i>you're</i> supposed to be.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.258
Leonardo. Da Vinci?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.761
The artist!
We're all dressed as artists.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.129
Kahlo, Picasso, Van Gogh.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.031
Oh. Of course.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.033
I definitely know those names.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.970
Why don't we just sit
and have a nice meal

10:03.103 --> 10:05.072
and you'll discover
how much you like
these people like I do?

10:08.541 --> 10:09.576
Oh!

10:09.710 --> 10:12.780
Aw, damn it! I'm turtling!

10:17.350 --> 10:19.119
<i>I had finally
gotten out of my shell,</i>

10:19.186 --> 10:21.621
<i>but was still feeling
uncomfortable around
Dave Kim's college friends.</i>

10:22.422 --> 10:24.091
Isn't this food just divine?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.626
My favorite is this brown pile.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.796
Totally unfamiliar
to my tongue,

10:28.929 --> 10:31.231
like an odd paste
from across the sea.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.433
Oh, that's the buticha.
It's a chickpea dip.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.036
You can either enjoy it
on its own
or with the injera bread.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.071
What if I don't enjoy it
either way?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.673
It's not your fault, man.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.009
Big agriculture
has been feeding you lies.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.478
You gotta expand your horizons,
put your mouth on the world.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.247
I once had a satay at EPCOT.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.516
Hey, did you guys know
that Adam's a filmmaker?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.483
- Hm.
- Hm.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.019
- Anything indie?
- Oh, yeah!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.021
I did a whole tribute
to <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:55.622
- Ironically?
- I don't think so.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.490
I made the Ark of the Covenant

10:57.624 --> 10:59.727
with the gold foil
from a thousand Rolos.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.095
So you're part of
the big Hollywood machine

11:02.229 --> 11:03.530
cranking out circuses
for the sheep?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.398
Fingers crossed.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.667
You know what I just saw
in the cinema? <i>Mannequin.</i>

11:07.801 --> 11:08.869
Oh, hell yeah!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.438
A well-done fantasy romance?
Yes, please!

11:11.571 --> 11:13.506
At best, it's sexist rubbish.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.709
I thought it was about
an assistant window dresser

11:15.843 --> 11:18.178
who falls in love
with a mannequin
who comes to life at night

11:18.311 --> 11:19.412
because of an ancient
Egyptian curse.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.014
Exactly.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.650
It's an adolescent
male director's
valentine to misogyny.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.119
And with sassy Meshach Taylor
as comic relief.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.688
Dave Kim, tell 'em.
You loved it.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.725
It was everything wrong
with humanity
in a tight 90 minutes.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.327
What's going on with you?
You love popcorn movies.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.030
I've expanded my horizons.
That's what you do in college.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.199
Oh, like your little DJ setup?

11:39.332 --> 11:41.501
I'll have you know
I'm the most sought-after MC

11:41.634 --> 11:44.271
on the third floor
of the west annex
of Hayden dorm.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.474
DKNY is being modest.
He's quite the impresario.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.708
Impresario?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.278
He means DKNY
throws the best parties.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.280
I get it.
Some classic Fitz irony.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.583
He's serious.
DKNY is a modern-day Gatsby.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.252
What can I say?
I'm the straw
that stirs the drink.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.892
So you're saying you could
throw a party anytime anywhere?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.459
Anyway. Anyhow.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.561
Then what a better time
than this weekend?

12:08.695 --> 12:12.232
I'd love to go to an epic
DKNY Halloween bash.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.935
Unless, of course, you can't
pull it together in time.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
Oh, I'll pull it together.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.508
I'll pull it together
and cement my reputation
as NYU's burgeoning bon vivant.

12:21.641 --> 12:26.013
Bon vivant!
Bon vivant! Bon vivant!

12:26.146 --> 12:28.581
Stop that! That's not
something people chant!

12:28.715 --> 12:30.483
<i>While I was
challenging Dave Kim,</i>

12:30.617 --> 12:32.752
<i>Geoff was facing
a challenge of his own.</i>

12:32.886 --> 12:34.788
Isn't this nice?

12:34.922 --> 12:37.624
Oh, you mean
spending two hours
packing up baby crap

12:37.757 --> 12:39.726
so that we can sleep
in a musty, empty shore house?

12:39.860 --> 12:42.362
The perfect Halloween.
No ghost, ghouls...

12:42.495 --> 12:43.530
or, even more frightening,
your mother.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.966
I get it. She's a lot.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.634
But you knew that when
we chose to live with her.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.469
What I didn't know
is that I would never get

12:49.602 --> 12:51.771
a single, solitary moment alone
with my own child.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.342
Well, now you're safe,
and I have no help
for the next few days.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.577
Thanks for no sleep
or showers in advance.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.980
Fear not, my skeptical queen.
I'll take care of everything.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.182
<i>But there was
one thing he missed.</i>

13:02.315 --> 13:05.618
Ohh!
Muriel's diaper cream!

13:05.752 --> 13:08.755
Oh, her sweet delicious tushie
is unprotected!

13:08.889 --> 13:09.857
Barry crisis!

13:11.758 --> 13:13.961
The Kremps' skeletons
are a bigger hit
than my ice-cream truck!

13:14.094 --> 13:15.262
So you stole them?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.629
What choice did I have?

13:16.763 --> 13:18.932
The truck frightened no one!

13:19.066 --> 13:22.635
In fact, I made a small fortune
selling Bomb Pops and Push-Ups.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.371
Damn my inviting face!

13:24.504 --> 13:26.806
Well, you've always been
too handsome.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.242
But I have to go.
Where are my keys?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.078
Good news, bad news.
Your keys are here,

13:31.211 --> 13:33.346
but all your tires
are on the ice-cream truck.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.216
What the [bleep] happened?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.986
Four simultaneous flats.
The less you know the better.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.353
Then how am I supposed to
get out to the shore

13:40.487 --> 13:42.789
to save my grandchild's
sensitive cheeks?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.824
- Here.
- Unbelievable.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.027
<i>While my mom was ready
to come to the rescue,</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.496
<i>Dave Kim's party
was on life support.</i>

13:49.629 --> 13:52.032
You know what's great
about no one being here?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.700
Plenty of room to dance.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.703
Sure. Ha ha.
But it's still early.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.972
Still early to hit the streets
and trick-or-treat
like old times?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.507
DKNY will wait it out.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.710
DKNY? Ugh.
Just drop the act already!

14:03.843 --> 14:06.046
You're not
an international impresario.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.848
You're just my dorky friend
from Jenkintown.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.552
I <i>was</i> your dorky friend
from Jenkintown. I've changed.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.354
That's what happens
when you go to college.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.722
But you wouldn't know that,
would you?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.724
Please!
You're just a big fat phony!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.592
Hey! Not cool, man!

14:19.726 --> 14:21.394
People are allowed to change.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.630
What happened
to your British accent?

14:23.763 --> 14:25.165
Oh, I'm actually from Tucson.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.534
I just thought it would make me
sound more interesting.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.937
And I only recently learned
the definition of irony.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.372
I can admit, I abuse the word.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.341
I know it seems like
I rage against the machine,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.109
but that's only
because I'm part of it.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.677
My dad owns 11 White Castles.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.580
Oh, my God! You're all phonies!

14:40.713 --> 14:42.349
There's nothing phony
about a fresh start.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.685
I was excited to share
my new life with you,

14:45.818 --> 14:48.355
but you just want me
to be the same loser
from high school.

14:49.656 --> 14:53.393
Congrats, Adam. You won.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.196
<i>While I suddenly
realized I had let Dave Kim
down as a friend,</i>

14:56.329 --> 14:59.066
<i>it was Geoff's turn
to step up as a dad.</i>

14:59.199 --> 15:01.501
Ah. Are you sure
you wanna do it all?
I can stay up with you.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.170
- No. I got this.
- Oh, thank God.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.771
Mama's gonna hit the hay.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.805
Get a good night's sleep, sweetie.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.076
Hello, beautiful!

15:09.209 --> 15:10.910
Finally,
it's just me and you.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.580
<i>It was what Geoff
had been dreaming about.</i>

15:13.713 --> 15:15.548
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm just changing you.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.749
<i>Until it became a nightmare.</i>

15:16.883 --> 15:19.386
Oh, no!
I forgot your boom-boom cream!

15:19.519 --> 15:20.887
Schwartz bottoms
are notoriously chafe-y!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.655
<i>- He tried feeding her.</i>
- So you're not hungry?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.091
You're just angry
for no reason?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.425
Just like your mama.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.560
Although she does get angry
when she's hungry, also,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.796
but there is that sweet spot
right after her Pop-Tart.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.731
Am I talking too much?
Is that what's making you cry?

15:31.864 --> 15:32.899
I'm gonna cry, too!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.567
<i>And as the hours went by...</i>

15:34.701 --> 15:37.004
Damn it.
Why can't I think of a lullaby?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.938
<i>♪ For she's a jolly good baby ♪</i>

15:39.072 --> 15:40.707
<i>** For she's
A jolly good baby ♪</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:43.143
I'm so exhausted!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.811
<i>...tired and out of ideas,</i>

15:44.944 --> 15:48.415
<i>Geoff decided to take Muriel
on a late-night stroll.</i>

15:48.548 --> 15:50.483
Ah. Fresh air
will solve everything.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.088
Oh, good. Halloween fog.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.290
Really calms a nervous fella.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.595
Huh.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.598
The haunting lilt
of an ice-cream truck.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.603
You know, Muriel,

16:10.737 --> 16:13.073
I'm really glad
that you're not old enough
to realize how frightened I am.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.779
Um...

16:19.912 --> 16:20.847
Okay. Well...

16:22.782 --> 16:23.683
time to run now.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.988
Give me back my baby, Geoffrey!

16:33.593 --> 16:35.462
Your demon grandma
has come to claim you!

16:35.595 --> 16:38.765
Wait. Muriel? Where are you?

16:38.898 --> 16:40.533
Oh, my God!
I'm the worst dad ever!

16:42.502 --> 16:45.238
You have failed, Geoff!

16:45.372 --> 16:47.607
Geoff...

16:47.740 --> 16:48.975
- Geoff?
- Geoff?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.544
Geoff? Geoff, wake up!

16:51.678 --> 16:54.447
Oh, thank God.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.016
I had this horrible dream
where-- where your mom
was trying to take the baby,

16:57.150 --> 16:59.586
a-and there was ice cream
and a song and--
Where's Muriel?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.089
She's right here safe with me.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.658
I'm sorry if my
ice-cream truck's music
invaded your dreams.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.764
<i>Just when
I was feeling bad about
my fight with Dave Kim,</i>

17:13.166 --> 17:15.502
<i>I ran into a Prince
that was feeling even worse.</i>

17:15.635 --> 17:17.870
Mr. Glascott? Are you okay?

17:18.004 --> 17:22.008
I'm very not.
I came in 17th out of 17.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.077
Sorry to hear that.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.080
There was an Apollonia
and a Vanity that both beat me.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.917
It never said anything
about Prince's muses
in the official rules.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.853
These people at Prince-o-ween,
they run a very loose ship.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.523
I think I might have a way
to salvage the night
for both of us.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.628
<i>That Halloween,
I wasn't the only one
trying to make things right.</i>

17:41.761 --> 17:44.364
Would you like to
hold your daughter?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.099
That's okay.
Seems like you got it.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.534
Oh, I do got it,

17:47.667 --> 17:52.705
but I realized
I was a tad, teensy-weensy...

17:52.839 --> 17:55.375
insanely overzealous
with my grandmothering.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.943
Well, maybe it's for the best

17:57.076 --> 17:59.879
'cause it's pretty clear
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.450
I see. Um, well,
I'll tell you a secret.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.185
There was a time in <i>my</i> life

18:05.318 --> 18:07.053
where I didn't know
what I was doing either.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.421
Really?

18:08.555 --> 18:10.022
Sure.

18:10.157 --> 18:13.826
I mean, now I'm calm and poised
and effortlessly beautiful,

18:13.960 --> 18:16.663
but when Erica was a baby,
I was a mess.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.998
And look how amazing
<i>I</i> turned out.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.468
Well, certainly
neither of you suffer
from self-esteem issues.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.205
But what if I screw up?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.707
Oh, you will. A lot.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.941
And it'll be okay.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.944
Muriel is the luckiest baby
in the world

18:32.078 --> 18:33.813
to have you two as parents.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.582
She'll teach you everything
you need to know.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.751
And I'm here if you need me.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.753
But this weekend is yours.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.159
<i>Sometimes you have to give people room
to be who they're meant to be,</i>

18:46.293 --> 18:48.661
<i>whether it's a new dad
or a whole new person.</i>

18:50.096 --> 18:52.232
DKNY.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.302
You don't have to call me that.
I'm just a phony, remember?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.404
No. You're not.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.539
You're just finding your way.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.543
And truth is... I'm jealous.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.513
It's not so easy
to see you in your new life
with your new friends.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.114
Adam, that doesn't
change anything.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.950
You'll always be my friend.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.752
And next year,
when you're here,

19:12.885 --> 19:14.086
we're gonna have
the time of our lives.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.155
Why wait?

19:23.330 --> 19:24.831
How'd you get
all these people here?

19:24.964 --> 19:26.466
I didn't. <i>You</i> did.

19:26.599 --> 19:30.002
Word got out
there's a DKNY party
with a very special guest.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.204
What are you talking about?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.074
You got Prince?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.977
It's dark
and everyone's loaded,
so let's find out!

19:41.080 --> 19:41.714
Dearly beloved...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.017
we are gathered here today

19:45.151 --> 19:49.188
to celebrate
one man named DKNY.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.027
<i>♪ And if de-elevator tries

20:37.103 --> 20:39.972
JTP, you have failed me.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.075
JTP. We have failed you?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.578
All I wanted was
to win a street war

20:45.712 --> 20:47.079
against my mother's best friend

20:47.213 --> 20:48.615
and dominate the neighborhood
with terror.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.650
I still think this night
was a success.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.985
Success?
Of <i>course</i> you're unfamiliar

20:53.119 --> 20:54.654
with that word's meaning,
Matt Bradley.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.623
You never once
tasted its glory.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.125
That seems
unnecessarily personal,

20:59.258 --> 21:02.061
but maybe it's a good thing
you made children happy today.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.832
Trick or treat!

21:05.965 --> 21:07.900
We heard you're
the kind, generous man

21:08.034 --> 21:09.135
with the ice-cream truck!

21:09.268 --> 21:10.470
You know what?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.705
I am.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.241
I guess the true meaning
of Halloween is about giving.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.543
There ya go.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.944
- He learned something.
- Wait for it.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.512
And I'll be giving you...

21:19.646 --> 21:20.847
terror!

21:20.980 --> 21:23.282
This is the last kid
who ate my ice cream!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.117
And you're next! Aah!

21:27.253 --> 21:29.989
Finally. A win.
