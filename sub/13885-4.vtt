01:00.240 --> 01:02.435
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:02.600 --> 01:07.196
Oh, no. Of course not.
I haven't engaged your verbal systems.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.794
(LISTER) Kryten.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.669
- Kryten, what you doing?
- I've repaired the toaster. Well, nearly.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.877
Oh, no! Dismantle him!
You don't know what he's like!

01:17.080 --> 01:20.675
I've read the documentation, sir.
He's simply a talking alarm clock

01:20.840 --> 01:23.434
who provides morning toast
and light conversation.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.160
- Not this one. This one's mental.
- Sir?

01:26.320 --> 01:30.598
He's defective. He wants everyone
to eat toast all of the time. He's obsessed.

01:30.760 --> 01:35.038
If you don't want 400 rounds of toast
every hour, he throws a wobbler.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.634
- That's what caused the accident.
- What accident?

01:37.800 --> 01:42.954
The accident involving me, the toaster,
the waste disposal and a 14lb lump hammer.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.635
That's why he was in the garbage hold
in 3,000 pieces.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.872
Another thing.
He always says "Howdy doodly do".

01:50.040 --> 01:53.999
Drives you spare.
What the smeg does "Howdy doodly do" mean?

01:54.160 --> 01:57.948
Well, just trust me, sir.
My motives will become clear.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.516
(CHIRPY VOICE) Howdy doodly do!
How's it going? I'm Talkie,

02:01.720 --> 02:05.076
Talkie Toaster,
your chirpy breakfast companion,

02:05.240 --> 02:09.152
Talkie's the name, toasting's the game,
Anyone like any toast?

02:09.320 --> 02:12.437
I don't want any toast. He doesn't want any toast.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.310
No one around here wants any toast.
Not now, not ever. No toast.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.069
- How about a muffin?
- Or muffins! We don't like muffins here!

02:21.280 --> 02:23.953
We want no muffins, no toast, no teacakes,

02:24.120 --> 02:26.634
no buns, baps, baguettes or bagels,

02:26.800 --> 02:29.473
no croissants, no crumpets, no pancakes,

02:29.640 --> 02:32.074
no potato cakes and no hot-cross buns

02:32.240 --> 02:34.310
and DEFINITELY no smeggin' flapjacks!

02:36.040 --> 02:38.793
Ah, so you're a waffle man!

02:39.720 --> 02:43.508
See? You see what he's like?
There's no reasoning with him.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.514
Allow me, sir. As one mechanical to another,
he'll understand me.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.835
Now, listen. You will not offer any grilled
bread products to any member of the crew.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.313
If you do, you will be on the receiving end
of a very large polo mallet!

02:59.520 --> 03:02.637
- Can I ask just one question?
- Of course.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.229
Would anyone like any toast?

03:05.400 --> 03:07.391
Didn't you hear what I just said?

03:07.560 --> 03:11.599
- Yes, but you might have changed your mind,
- You see what he's like?

03:11.760 --> 03:14.479
- We haven't changed our mind!
- No toast!

03:14.680 --> 03:19.913
But I'm a toaster, It is my raison d'etre,
I toast, therefore I am,

03:20.080 --> 03:23.675
- If you don't want toast, why repair me?
- Yeah, why?

03:23.840 --> 03:26.673
He's a guinea pig for "intelligence compression".

03:26.840 --> 03:29.559
His AI chips were badly damaged in the accident.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.479
That was no accident,
That was first-degree toastercide!

03:32.680 --> 03:34.875
- Just shut your grill!
- Ow!

03:35.080 --> 03:39.596
By re-routing his circuitry and channelling
all his run-time through a single CPU,

03:39.760 --> 03:44.470
I've restored his intelligence,
at the cost of reducing his operational lifespan.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.552
- So?
- So, it could work with Holly.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.998
We could restore her IQ of 6,000.
She could be brilliant again.

03:54.040 --> 03:58.750
You really think that airhead of a computer
can become a genius again?

03:58.960 --> 04:01.997
Well, it could hardly make her worse.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.870
Right. If she counts without banging her head
on the screen, it'll be an improvement.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.038
Computer senility - such a weird condition.

04:10.240 --> 04:15.075
I know. I had a mechanoid friend
with the same affliction. His name was Gilbert,

04:15.240 --> 04:22.954
but he preferred Rameses Niblick III
Kerplunk Kerplunk Whoops Where's My Thribble?

04:23.120 --> 04:27.033
- A sad case.
- The Eskimos had the right idea.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.272
They knew how to handle the elderly
and permanently baffled.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.513
Middle of the night, they'd take them
into the blizzard, remove their pyjamas

04:34.680 --> 04:36.875
and leave them to it.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.719
That's how the Eskimos cared for old people?

04:39.920 --> 04:43.993
Absolutely. That's why
there's no Eskimo word for "Eastbourne".

04:45.160 --> 04:48.914
If Holly gets her brains back,
she'll be able to do anything -

04:49.080 --> 04:51.310
invent a hyperdrive, get back to Earth...

04:51.480 --> 04:55.712
If Earth still exists. If it does,
it's doubtful the human race survived.

04:55.920 --> 05:01.233
All right, a time machine. We could all pick
whatever period we wanted to live in.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.911
Well, it'll be the 19th century for me.
One of Napoleon's marshals.

05:06.080 --> 05:11.632
The chance to cross Europe with
the greatest general of all time and kill Belgians.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.189
- Marvellous.
- What about you, Kryters?

05:14.400 --> 05:17.995
Well, if I could go
absolutely anywhere at all in time,

05:18.160 --> 05:21.391
I think I'd probably choose a week last Tuesday.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.191
- Why?
- Don't you remember?

05:25.360 --> 05:28.591
I did all the laundry and then we watched TV.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.832
We won't see the like of those days again.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.031
- How long now?
- Nearly there, Hol.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.034
A couple of minutes to load the circuits,
maybe a minute to finalise the connection.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.988
Just three minutes, then?
Better get down to the science room.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.475
We'd better pray to God this works.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.752
That ion storm has really done her head in, man,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.512
(BLEEPING)

05:51.720 --> 05:55.679
- There's the signal. Everything's set.
- Let's hope you don't get an overload,

05:55.880 --> 05:58.348
- What if I do?
- You'll explode,

05:58.560 --> 05:59.993
I'll live.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.670
It's coming. I can feel it.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.192
Strike a light! I'm a genius again!

06:28.360 --> 06:33.070
I know everything! Metaphysics, philosophy,
the purpose of being - everything!

06:33.240 --> 06:36.277
- Ask me any question. I'll answer it.
- Any question?

06:36.480 --> 06:40.473
- Yes.
- How to break the speed of light?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.632
Any question at all and you will answer?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.394
- Yes.
- OK, here's my question,,,

06:46.600 --> 06:48.670
Would you like some toast?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.468
No, thank you. Now ask me another.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.513
Do you know anything about chaos theory?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.478
I know everything about chaos theory.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.234
Oh, very well, Here's my second question,,,

07:01.440 --> 07:03.908
Would you like a crumpet?

07:05.040 --> 07:08.510
I 'm a computer with a IQ of 12,000.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.832
You don't seem to understand -
I know the meaning of the universe.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.635
- That is not answering my question,
- No, I would not like a crumpet!

07:16.840 --> 07:20.549
Ask me a sensible question.
Preferably one that isn't bread-related.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.797
Very well, I have a third question,

07:23.960 --> 07:28.795
A sensible question, A question
that will tax your new IQ to its very limits

07:28.960 --> 07:31.918
and stretch your knowledge to bursting point,

07:32.120 --> 07:35.271
This is going to be about waffles, isn't it?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.715
Certainly not, And I resent the implication

07:37.880 --> 07:41.156
that I'm a one-dimensional,
bread-obsessed electrical appliance,

07:41.320 --> 07:43.959
I apologise, toaster. What's the question?

07:44.120 --> 07:48.511
The question is this - given that God is infinite,

07:48.720 --> 07:51.792
and that the universe is also infinite,

07:51.960 --> 07:54.315
would you like a toasted teacake?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.951
That's another bready question.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.470
It's not just bready, It's quite curranty, too,

08:00.640 --> 08:04.474
Ask a question that is wholly unbready
and not even slightly curranty.

08:04.680 --> 08:11.279
OK, Why have you got an IQ of 12,000
when it was supposed to return to six?

08:11.480 --> 08:14.040
Good question! There was a miscalculation.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.113
My IQ has doubled, but my life expectancy
has been exponentially reduced.

08:18.320 --> 08:24.395
So what is your life expectancy? 345 years?
Well, better than a kick in the bread tray,

08:24.600 --> 08:30.311
- Missed the decimal point...
- You have only 3,41 years left to live?

08:30.520 --> 08:33.114
That's not years. That's minutes!

08:33.320 --> 08:36.039
Here's my next question -
what the smeg will you do?!

08:36.200 --> 08:39.590
To conserve my run-time,
I'm going to switch myself off.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.548
Wait! There is one question
the others will have to know!

08:43.720 --> 08:46.917
- What?
- Would you like a cheese and ham Breville?

08:47.920 --> 08:50.878
No indication of signal failure.
All signs are excellent.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.395
I really believe we've done it.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.478
- What's happened?
- What's going on?

08:57.680 --> 09:00.069
Listen. Can anyone hear anything?

09:01.240 --> 09:04.391
- No.
- Precisely. No one can hear anything.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.996
- And you know why we can't hear anything?
- Why?

09:09.200 --> 09:12.351
Because there are no sounds to hear.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.918
Kryten, isn't it this time of year
that your head goes for re-tuning?

09:18.520 --> 09:23.036
No, no, he's right. There's no sounds
because the engines are dead.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.716
We've lost all power!

09:28.040 --> 09:30.679
Everything's down, man, even the doors!

09:30.880 --> 09:33.235
We've got to get to the science room.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.871
There are 53 doors between here and there.
What are we going to do?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.793
Hey, I got it. We laser our way through!

09:40.960 --> 09:44.316
An excellent suggestion, sir,
with just two minor drawbacks.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.074
One - there's no power source for the lasers.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.198
And two - we don't have any lasers.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.832
Look, they're only interior doors.
They're only a light alloy.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.753
Maybe we could get through with a battering ram.

09:57.920 --> 10:03.358
All we need is something, say, six foot long,
fairly sturdy, with a flat top.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.873
53 doors?! You can't be serious!

10:19.880 --> 10:23.350
- You OK, man?
- I'm fine, thank you, Susan.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.550
It doesn't make sense.
Holly's off-lined and powered down the ship.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.109
Why? Why would she turn herself off?

10:31.320 --> 10:34.278
We can soon find out. Kryten, boot her up.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.670
Try it again.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.397
Go away!

10:45.240 --> 10:48.789
What's going on?
Give me voice control on the reboot command.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.353
(BLEEPING)

10:50.560 --> 10:51.959
- On.
- Off.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.639
- On.
- Off.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.159
- On.
- Off.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.635
Kryten, can we override her shutdown veto?

10:57.840 --> 11:01.515
- Yes, but may I suggest that...
- Don't, just do it.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.551
- On.
- Off. Off. OFF!

11:07.720 --> 11:12.191
Now, perhaps we can have a proper conversation
conducted in a civilised manner.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.756
- Take out the inhibitor! Switch me off!
- What is going on?

11:15.960 --> 11:20.078
No time to explain. Intelligence compressed.
Reduced lifespan. 2.35 remaining.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.716
- Come again?
- IQ 12,000. Two minutes and closing.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.990
Holly, what are you drivelling about?

11:26.200 --> 11:29.636
You're a total smeghead, aren't you, Rimmer?

11:29.840 --> 11:33.435
Why are you so unable to grasp
this extraordinarily simple premise?

11:33.640 --> 11:37.997
- What premise?
- I will expire in just under two minutes.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.790
Understand, moose brain?
Any further questions? Take your time.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.758
One minute thirty and counting. No rush.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.918
- God! Shouldn't we switch you off?
- Oh, let me see...

11:49.120 --> 11:51.350
Get her off, man! Get her off!

11:52.120 --> 11:56.113
- Great. Where does this leave us?
- Floating aimlessly in space,

11:56.280 --> 11:59.989
with no navigation and a rapidly diminishing
emergency power supply.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.835
It leaves us galloping up Diarrhoea Drive
without a saddle.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.192
So how come
Grand Canyon Nostrils is still here?

12:08.400 --> 12:12.632
- Yeah, Rimmer hasn't been wiped.
- He must be linked to emergency power.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.833
- But isn't that an enormous drain?
- Yes, but if we switch him off,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.072
we wouldn't have enough emergency power
to re-initialise him.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.949
Mr Rimmer would be effectively dead.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.674
Hey, things are looking up already!

12:27.200 --> 12:30.397
Forget it.
Whatever it is you're suggesting, forget it.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.269
But the entire ship is running
on emergency battery power only.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.273
With the oxygen recycler
and minimal heating and lighting,

12:37.440 --> 12:41.797
I estimate that Lister and the Cat
have approximately two months left.

12:41.960 --> 12:46.875
Without your drain on the power,
they might last six. I'm sorry, sir.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.718
Sorry? Why?

12:48.920 --> 12:54.313
Well, Space Corps Directive 195 clearly states
that in an emergency power situation,

12:54.520 --> 12:59.469
a hologrammatic crew member must lay down
his life so that living crew members survive.

12:59.680 --> 13:05.357
Yes, but Rimmer Directive 271 states
just as clearly, "No chance, you metal bastard."

13:08.120 --> 13:13.194
Come on, man! You gotta sacrifice your life!
I'm not asking you to do anything I wouldn't.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.472
You'd sacrifice your life for the good of the crew?

13:16.680 --> 13:19.831
No, I'd sacrifice YOUR life
for the good of the crew.

13:20.040 --> 13:25.956
I beg you to reconsider. Human history
is resplendent with examples of such sacrifice.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.557
Remember Captain Oates?
"I'm going out for a walk. I may be some time."

13:30.760 --> 13:33.274
Yes, but the thing is about Captain Oates...

13:33.440 --> 13:37.149
The thing you have to remember
about Captain Oates... Captain Oates...

13:37.320 --> 13:41.233
Captain Oates was a prat.
I'd have stayed in the tent,

13:41.400 --> 13:46.838
whacked Scott over the head
with a frozen husky...and then eaten him.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.749
- You would, wouldn't you?
- History, Lister, is written by the winners.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.673
How do we know
Oates took this legendary walk?

13:53.840 --> 13:57.150
>From the only surviving document - Scott's diary.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.598
He was hardly likely to write,
"February 1st, bludgeoned Oates while he slept,

14:01.760 --> 14:05.275
"then scoffed him
along with the last packet of instant mash."

14:05.440 --> 14:11.037
How's that going to look, eh? No, much better
to say, "Oates made the supreme sacrifice,"

14:11.200 --> 14:14.909
while you're dabbing up his gravy
with crusty bread.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.271
You've got no magnificence
in your soul, Rimmer.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.630
We can eliminate the switch-off option.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.037
- So what now?
- Well, it's back to basics.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.228
No heat, no light, no power. We can't get food
out of the dispensing machines.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.834
We'll have to scavenge in the cargo decks.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.117
Without computers and technology,
we're reduced to primitives.

14:35.280 --> 14:39.239
All we've got is us, guys.
Us and our own resourcefulness.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.874
My God. It's worse than I thought.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.750
Come on! You're slowing down!

14:54.920 --> 14:57.992
I've been going 20 minutes.
Of course I'm slowing down!

14:58.200 --> 15:00.668
- Keep going. We're nearly there.
- Face it, man.

15:00.840 --> 15:05.516
It's just not possible to fry an egg
using a bicycle-powered hairdryer.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.999
Sure it is! You just never pedal fast enough.
Come on! Keep pumping! One last try!

15:13.200 --> 15:16.397
- (HAIRDRYER WHIRRS)
- Yeah! We're cookin' now!

15:16.560 --> 15:19.552
How do you want yours? Permed or blow-dried?

15:19.720 --> 15:23.235
I can't go on, man. I'm finished. Finished.

15:23.440 --> 15:27.752
So we're back on the cold beans again?
Oh, not more beans, man.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.754
It smells like the inside
of a packet of dry roasted peanuts.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.952
Plus, it's 20 minutes sawing the lid off
'cause all the openers are electric.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.390
Everything on the smeggin' ship's electric, man -

15:39.560 --> 15:41.596
heat, lights, doors.

15:41.760 --> 15:47.312
I never realised how dependent we were.
I just plugged things in and pressed "on".

15:47.480 --> 15:51.917
I don't even know how to make oxygen,
just that it ends in "osis".

15:52.080 --> 15:56.358
Or is it "esis"? I don't know!
Why did I never pay attention in biology?

15:56.520 --> 16:01.230
Why did I always turn to page 47
and draw little beards on the sperms?

16:01.800 --> 16:05.952
Look, conserve your energy.
Stan and Ollie will soon be back with supplies.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.271
Meanwhile,
let's just stay warm and get some sleep.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.189
- Yeah, man. You're right.
- Hey, where you going, bud?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.920
- To get some sleep.
- It's Tuesday, right?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.718
Yeah. So?

16:17.880 --> 16:21.316
My turn on the electric blanket. Pedal.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.359
Wake me in eight hours.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.909
Five days to get to and from the cargo deck.
Unbelievable!

16:33.080 --> 16:36.993
That's 2,000 floors, sir.
Without the lifts, we made pretty good time.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.589
(THUNDEROUS CRASH)

16:41.360 --> 16:43.590
Hmm... Interesting.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.869
(HUMMING)

16:49.760 --> 16:53.594
(SLOWED DOWN)
My heavens! What on earth was that?

16:54.520 --> 16:59.833
(SPEEDED UP) It came from outside the ship.
Can we get a damage report? What's going on?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.798
Why are you speaking so quickly, sir?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.231
I'm not speaking quickly.
It's you. You're speaking too slowly.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.278
It's like talking to Paul Robeson on dope.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.151
(HUMMING)

17:13.319 --> 17:15.834
- How do I sound now?
- Normal. How do I sound?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.036
Likewise.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.794
(HUMMING)

17:20.960 --> 17:24.635
(SLOWED DOWN) What about now?
(SPEEDED UP) You sound very peculiar,

17:24.800 --> 17:27.553
as if you're speaking in slow motion.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.076
(HUMMING)

17:32.080 --> 17:34.469
- And now?
- Normal. Curious.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.589
It's like experiencing relative time dilation
in an amazingly compressed space.

17:39.760 --> 17:45.596
That's exactly what I thought. Relative time
dilation. You're a mind-reader, Kryten.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.396
We should go to the science room
and consult Holly. It's only two floors up.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.630
She's got two minutes of run-time left.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.872
With her new IQ, it could be enough.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.437
- What is it?
- I've never seen one, no one has,

18:04.600 --> 18:07.637
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

18:07.800 --> 18:10.553
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.952
A black hole sucks time and matter
out of the universe. A white hole returns it.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.998
So that thing's spewing time
back into the universe?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.796
Precisely. That's why we're experiencing
these curious time phenomena on board.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.912
- What is it?
- I've never seen one, no one has,

18:26.080 --> 18:29.356
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

18:29.520 --> 18:32.159
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.518
A black hole sucks time and matter
out of the universe. A white hole returns it.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.598
So that thing's spewing time
back into the universe?

18:39.800 --> 18:44.396
Precisely. That's why we're experiencing
these curious time phenomena on board.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.195
- What time phenomena?
- Like just then, when time repeated itself.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.233
So, what is it?

18:51.440 --> 18:54.000
Only joking.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.714
OK, so it's decided, then. We consult Holly.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.595
Hey, wait a minute. I missed the discussion!

19:00.800 --> 19:03.678
- We all did.
- Time is occurring in random pockets.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.149
The laws of causality no longer apply.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.790
- Action no longer leads to consequence.
- So, what is it?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.833
We've experienced this period of time before.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.237
- Only joking.
- And that one.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.198
Since we're no longer affected
by laws of causality,

19:19.360 --> 19:22.477
we can override these time jumps
if we concentrate.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.394
- Look, we have to consult Holly.
- I'll go with that.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.149
- Gets my vote.
- OK, so it's decided. We consult Holly.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.272
Ah, we've just encountered
the middle of this conversation.

19:33.480 --> 19:38.076
- So, what is it?
- Someone punch him out. Boot Holly up.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.510
Perhaps I should talk to her.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.275
Leave this to me, Kryten.
On. White hole. Spewing time.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.398
- Engines dead. Air supply low. Advice.
- Excuse me?

19:47.560 --> 19:50.120
- White hole. Spewing time...
- I can't understand you.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.356
- White. Hole.
- Yes. Right.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.596
- Spewing. Time.
- Yes. With you.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.439
- Engines dead. Air supply low.
- Oh. Ah.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.676
- Advice, please.
- Right.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.556
It's a computer slug. It looks like
it's compatible with Starbug's navicomp.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.797
- What is it?
- I've never seen one, no one has,

20:08.960 --> 20:11.997
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

20:12.160 --> 20:15.550
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction...

20:22.760 --> 20:25.797
- We should be getting something now, sir.
- Yeah.

20:25.960 --> 20:30.192
The most audacious piece of astronavigation
in the history of the universe.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.119
- I don't understand.
- It's quite straightforward, sir.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.751
Starbug is going to fire a thermonuclear
device into this sun here,

20:37.920 --> 20:41.833
creating a solar flare
which will knock that planet out of orbit

20:42.000 --> 20:46.312
and send it rocketing across space
into a white hole, blocking it up.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.512
Is she doing what I think she's doing?

20:49.720 --> 20:53.349
- What do you think she's doing?
- Playing pool with planets.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.438
- Is that possible?
- Well, it won't work. It's insane.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.875
It's whacko. It's noodle-doodle.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.914
- I'm with you, buddy.
- Not the idea, the shot. Not enough side.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.590
- Side?
- Yeah, side-spin. It's a complete miscue.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.555
What are you drivelling about? We're talking
about a computer with an IQ of 12,000.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.832
Doesn't mean she can play pool. I can. Trust me.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.393
I know whereof I speak.
They called me Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister -

21:20.560 --> 21:23.632
once I was on the table, you couldn't shift me.

21:24.400 --> 21:29.474
This pool arm is as sound as a dollarpound.
That shot will not come off.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.359
She's topped it. It's a felt-ripper.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.189
That planet is off the table
and into somebody's pint of beer.

21:36.360 --> 21:41.070
We are talking about the trigonomics
of four-dimensional space, you gimboid!

21:41.240 --> 21:46.075
We are not talking about some seedy game
of pool in a backstreet Scouse drinking pit.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.510
- It's the same principle.
- Of course it isn't.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.433
I promise you, that is a complete miscue.

21:51.600 --> 21:56.515
- I say we let me take the shot.
- Well, I say we put it to the vote.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.912
On one hand, we have a computer
with an IQ in excess of 12,000,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.548
who has a total grasp of astrophysics.

22:03.720 --> 22:10.193
And on the other hand, we have Lister,
who - let's be fair to him - is a complete gimp.

22:10.360 --> 22:15.559
To whom do we entrust our lives, the safety
of this vessel and the future of everything?

22:15.720 --> 22:18.871
If it's a tie, we go with Holly. Lister?

22:19.520 --> 22:22.557
Well, I vote for Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister.

22:22.760 --> 22:27.754
- One-nil. I vote for Holly. Cat?
- Well, I agree with you, buddy,

22:27.920 --> 22:30.593
but I'm voting for Doodoo-Breath.

22:30.800 --> 22:36.158
See, even though you're right, I couldn't vote
for someone with your dress sense.

22:36.360 --> 22:40.478
I couldn't put my cross next to the bri-nylon party.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.791
- Down to you, Kryten.
- It's insane and suicidal, sir,

22:43.960 --> 22:46.110
but I have to side with the human.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.837
- Brutal!
- You're voting for El Dirtball?

22:51.560 --> 22:55.678
- It's in my programming, sir.
- A living human outranks a hologram.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.435
- I'm sorry.
- Three-one to me! Let's do it!

22:59.640 --> 23:03.315
Congratulations, Kryten.
Your vote has just killed everyone.

23:03.520 --> 23:08.594
Will you relax? I've seen Gerbil-Face play
down in the recreation room. He's a diva!

23:08.760 --> 23:11.832
He can knock those balls around all night long,

23:12.000 --> 23:18.155
and I have never once seen him
lose a single ball down one of those holes!

23:34.920 --> 23:38.390
- How much are you going to drink?
- Don't talk. Game on.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.434
You're going to drink an entire six-pack
of "wicked strength" lager?

23:42.600 --> 23:45.956
I'm not gonna get plastered, Rimmer,
just...just nicely drunk.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.835
Define "nicely drunk".
Is that horizontal or perpendicular?

23:50.040 --> 23:52.793
- I can handle it.
- I'm not sure I can.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.515
We're in the wrong position.
It's easier from over here.

23:56.680 --> 24:01.754
That's right in the path of the planet!
If you miss, we get a planet in the face.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.679
- I'm not gonna mish.
- "Mish"?

24:05.880 --> 24:08.440
- What?
- You said "mish". "I'm not gonna mish."

24:08.600 --> 24:11.558
- Two cans and you're steaming!
- Rimmer, relax.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.996
I know what I'm doing. I am not pished.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.191
(CLATTER)

24:49.800 --> 24:51.950
(RESOUNDING BLAST)

24:57.240 --> 24:59.390
(RIMMER) He's missed.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.678
We're finished.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.870
What the smeg is going on?!

25:12.560 --> 25:14.790
(LISTER) She rides!

25:22.520 --> 25:26.274
- You jammy goit!
- Played for and got!

25:26.480 --> 25:30.075
- Surely not, sir.
- Are you saying that was a trick shot?

25:31.600 --> 25:36.754
Intended! Pool god! King of the cues!
Prince of the planet-potters!

25:38.600 --> 25:43.515
'Ere, what's goin' on? What happened
to that plan to make me brilliant again?

25:43.720 --> 25:47.110
Of course. Blocking up the white hole
has eradicated its influence.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.397
The time it spewed into the universe
no longer exists.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.716
- Meaning?
- Basically, we occupy a redundant timeline.

25:54.880 --> 25:58.873
Reviving the toaster, making Holly a genius -
none of this will have happened.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.550
What about us? Are we just going to cease to be?

26:02.760 --> 26:05.593
We'll cease to be here,

26:05.760 --> 26:09.958
but we will exist back on Red Dwarf,
before all this began,

26:10.120 --> 26:14.716
with, of course, no memory of these events,
which, of course, never happened.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.555
And as these events never happened,
we'll have no memory of them.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.952
In which case, Mr Rimmer,
I should like to take this opportunity of saying

26:23.120 --> 26:27.830
that you are the most obnoxious,
trumped-up, farty little smeghead

26:28.000 --> 26:30.798
it has ever been my misfortune to encounter!

26:35.520 --> 26:38.876
# It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere

26:39.040 --> 26:42.271
# I'm all alone, more or less

26:42.440 --> 26:45.557
# Let me fly far away from here

26:45.720 --> 26:48.393
# Fun, fun, fun

26:48.560 --> 26:52.109
# In the sun, sun, sun

26:52.280 --> 26:55.477
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

26:55.640 --> 26:58.791
# Drinking fresh mango juice

26:58.960 --> 27:02.157
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

27:02.320 --> 27:05.039
# Fun, fun, fun

27:05.200 --> 27:08.715
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:08.880 --> 27:11.599
# Fun, fun, fun

27:11.760 --> 27:15.639
# In the sun, sun, sun #
