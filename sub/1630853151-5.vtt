00:05.705 --> 00:07.640
Hey, boo.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.640
Hey.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.242
I got some great news.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.411
You got a job.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.411
Nope.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.712
Three interviews,
three rejections

00:12.779 --> 00:14.214
and one parking ticket.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.250
I guess that's better
than three parking tickets

00:17.317 --> 00:19.085
and one rejection.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.754
{\an1}I sent out
an email blast

00:20.820 --> 00:23.256
to all of my clients
about quitting Ruth's salon.

00:23.323 --> 00:24.524
Uh, yeah, but you didn't quit.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.159
My mom got you fired.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.028
Well, I thought
"moving on to new horizons"

00:29.095 --> 00:31.498
sounded better than
"my mother-in-law told my boss

00:31.564 --> 00:34.234
to pull up her skirt
and sit on a cactus."

00:34.300 --> 00:36.436
{\an5}Controlling the narrative, nice.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.436
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.705
The great part is,
a lot of my clients said

00:38.772 --> 00:40.607
{\an3}that they would follow me
wherever I go.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.709
Which, for the moment...

00:42.776 --> 00:44.377
happens to be our kitchen sink.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.214
Hey, Apple was started
in a garage.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.583
{\an5}You're already doing better
than those dorks.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.583
(chuckles)

00:50.650 --> 00:52.552
Would you please fix

00:52.619 --> 00:54.320
the doorknob
in the downstairs bathroom?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.588
Oh, yeah, no problem.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.290
Pretty sure it's just
a twisty-shaky deal.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.625
{\an3}That's why
you're the best.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.693
I thought it was
a shaky-twisty deal.

01:01.861 --> 01:04.197
{\an5}Dinner's almost ready.

01:01.861 --> 01:04.197
Where's everybody?

01:04.263 --> 01:06.466
Uh, Sam's washing up, and
your mom's not here yet.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.068
That's weird. She's never late
for a taco night.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.471
Unless it's on the same night
as <i> WrestleMania.</i>

01:11.538 --> 01:13.473
{\an1}I'm giving her
a call.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.408
Got her voice mail.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.310
{\an5}Just leave her a message.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.310
Yeah, I'm trying to.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.678
{\an1}There's, like,
ten seconds of dead air

01:18.745 --> 01:20.280
before her greeting starts.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.483
Mom, hi, uh...

01:23.550 --> 01:25.485
it's taco night
and where are you?

01:25.552 --> 01:27.620
{\an4}Can you please call me back?
We're hungry.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.620
(laughs)

01:27.687 --> 01:29.222
And one last time...

01:29.289 --> 01:31.191
if you sneeze
during your outgoing message,

01:31.257 --> 01:32.692
you can just record a new one.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.562
{\an1}That's free, they don't,
they don't charge for that.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.830
{\an1}Okay?

01:36.896 --> 01:38.698
Call me back.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.600
{\an1}That's weird,
she always answers.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.435
{\an1}Even when she's
on the can.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.437
Which is why
I'll never FaceTime her again.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.611
Great, now her mailbox is full.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.146
{\an3}Tom, I'm sure
she's fine.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.447
Yeah, probably.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.381
It's only been half an hour.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.817
You spend more time
in the cereal aisle.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.722

02:02.789 --> 02:04.591
But I don't want to under-react.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.693
You could just try
reacting appropriately.

It means that your mom is

who dove into Lake Michigan

06:10.503 --> 06:13.873

06:13.940 --> 06:15.575
I remember.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.452
Yeah, but I--

06:26.519 --> 06:28.621
I'm starting to worry about
her living alone at this age.

I mean, she's
a proud woman.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.625
{\an3}She wouldn't even ask us
for help if she did need it.

06:32.692 --> 06:33.860
She's not that old.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.561
She couldn't even call me.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.497
{\an3}What was gonna happen if
I didn't get there in time?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.899
I-I don't want to lose my mom
because she doesn't like phones

06:39.966 --> 06:41.634
'cause they make
her pocket hot.

06:42.802 --> 06:43.870
{\an1}Okay, then why don't you
just get her

06:43.936 --> 06:45.671
one of those smart watches?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.007
You know, then she can wear it
all the time and call for help.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.576
Plus, you'll be able
to track wherever she is.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.013
{\an3}Wait, you're-you're suggesting
we put a tracking device

06:54.080 --> 06:56.015
{\an3}on my mom like she's
a wild animal?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.117

what a hotcake is, to be honest.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.855
Some sort of pancake?

07:35.922 --> 07:37.957
No, it's not a pancake,
it's a flapjack.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.792

a flapjack is a griddle cake.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.194

07:49.902 --> 07:51.204
We're here to get a smart watch.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.839
Lew knows all about 'em,

07:52.905 --> 07:54.073
so I thought he could help us
pick one out.

07:54.140 --> 07:54.941
{\an3}Yeah, just tell me
what you need,

07:55.007 --> 07:56.542
and I'll set you up.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.244
{\an1}What do I need
a smart watch for?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.213
When I wake up,
I know it's 5:00 a.m.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.949
When <i> Blue Bloods</i> is on,
I know it's 9:00 p.m.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.518
Anything else,
I'll get there when I get there.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.955
Mom, it's not just
to tell time, okay?

08:09.021 --> 08:10.756
These things can
make phone calls,

08:10.823 --> 08:12.091
it keeps track of your location,

08:12.158 --> 08:13.960
plus it's always with you.

08:14.026 --> 08:17.096
Jesus is always with me,
and he has no monthly fee.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.067
Can I get a amen?

08:19.031 --> 08:21.067
Amen.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.137
Okay, so it's not quite
as good as Jesus,

08:25.204 --> 08:28.207
but, you know,
they're both waterproof.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.111
Okay, look, it's not just
for you, it's for me.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.647
So I know where you are
and-and that you're okay.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.849
Oh, I see, you don't think
I can take care of myself.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.784
{\an5}Is that what you're saying?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.784
{\an3}No.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.852
(stammers)
Look... you can,

08:40.919 --> 08:43.256
but if wearing the watch
makes me feel better,

08:43.322 --> 08:44.957
what's the big deal?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.660
This is what I get
for coddling you too much.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.028
I knew I shouldn't have
breastfed you

08:49.095 --> 08:50.763
for two whole weeks.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.533
{\an1}Can I get some help,
Lew?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.969
{\an3}I don't know, man,
I think the damage is done.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.172
The watches, Lew.

09:00.239 --> 09:01.607
Oh, yes, yes.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.609
Right, okay, um...

09:03.676 --> 09:04.877
{\an3}so these are
the cheap ones.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.779
Easy on the wallet,
nice on the wrist.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.147
Uh, do you have Wi-Fi?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.249
She doesn't.
She steals it from her neighbor.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.118
If he has a problem with that,
he can

09:12.184 --> 09:14.921
wheel his chair over
and tell me to my face.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.959
I don't think we believe
in the same Jesus.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.995
{\an3}Okay, um...

09:23.062 --> 09:24.997
{\an3}so once you sync
your contacts with this,

09:25.064 --> 09:26.666
{\an3}you'll be able
to use voice command

09:26.732 --> 09:29.268
{\an3}to make calls or texts
just by holding this button.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.937
It's-it's pretty
self-explanatory.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.838
If it's so self-explanatory,
what are you still

09:32.905 --> 09:35.141
flapping your yap about?

09:35.207 --> 09:36.943
Come on, Ma.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.644
These things are cool.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.179
You can use it like
a walkie-talkie like Dick Tracy,

09:40.246 --> 09:41.981
{\an5}send texts.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.981
Check the weather.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.750
You can even set a reminder
for Tom Selleck's birthday.

09:44.817 --> 09:45.818
He's your favorite!

09:45.885 --> 09:47.219
You'll never forget--

09:47.286 --> 09:49.655
{\an1}Ma?

09:50.856 --> 09:52.124
She's gone.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.760
Just like my last stepdad.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.667
{\an3}Come on, Ma,
what's the big deal?

10:01.734 --> 10:03.002
It's just a watch.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.670
I am not an invalid.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.772
I didn't say you were.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.841
{\an1}You didn't have to say it,
the way that you're treating me.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.142
{\an1}Trying to get me
to wear

10:10.209 --> 10:12.645
{\an1}some fancy
LifeAlert bracelet.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.613
Ma, you had literally fallen

10:14.680 --> 10:16.015
and could not get up.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.652
{\an1}I'm not wearing
that stupid watch

10:19.719 --> 10:21.787
{\an1}so that you'll know
where I am every second.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.923
{\an3}Come on, don't think
of it like that.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.058
{\an3}This thing can make
your life a lot easier.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.927
{\an3}Look, I already
set it up.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.862
Call Tom.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.297
{\an5}WATCH:
Which Tom?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.065
Tom Smallwood.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.800
{\an5}Tom Smallwood was
a ship captain

10:34.867 --> 10:36.936
{\an5}who was thrown overboard
by his mutinous crew

10:37.003 --> 10:39.038
in the year 1619.

10:40.206 --> 10:44.210
He was probably trying to get
'em to all wear smart watches.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.047
{\an3}You're saying he was
a good and fair captain

10:48.114 --> 10:50.883
{\an3}who cared about the
well-being of his crew?

10:50.950 --> 10:54.086
{\an3}Look, what happened
really made me worry, Mom.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.421
{\an3}Do you have any idea
what was going

10:55.488 --> 10:57.356
through my mind
as I drove over here?

10:57.423 --> 10:58.824
Don't worry about me.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.227
I am not kicking
the bucket anytime soon.

11:01.293 --> 11:04.030
If I live as long
as my mother did,

11:04.096 --> 11:07.233
I still have
14 Christmases left.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.337
Wow, Ma, you have a real
chipper way of putting things.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.806
I can't believe Hallmark
hasn't snatched you up.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.941
I am just trying
to be realistic.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.810
{\an3}Yeah, and I'm doing this
because I care.

Well, where the hell
is this coming from?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.390
{\an1}Around hour two
sitting on the toilet.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.425
{\an1}Look...

16:33.492 --> 16:35.361
I know you're fine,
and-and falling

16:35.427 --> 16:37.196
could've happened to anyone.
The problem was me.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.597
Yeah, I could've told you that.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.732
{\an5}Will you let me finish?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.732
All right.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.568
{\an1}Look, I just did
a lot of thinking.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.136
Mostly because the only thing
that works

16:44.203 --> 16:46.372
on this dumb watch
is the meditation app.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.475
Look, there's gonna be a point

16:49.541 --> 16:51.210
where you can't take care
of yourself

16:51.276 --> 16:53.679
and you'll have to move in,
but-but why wait?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.148
{\an1}Why not do it
while you're healthy,

16:56.215 --> 16:58.417
{\an1}while we can all
still enjoy each other?

16:58.484 --> 17:00.719
So I am supposed to just

17:00.786 --> 17:02.588
pack up my life

17:02.654 --> 17:05.089
and move all my stuff in here.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.358
Is that what you want?

17:06.425 --> 17:09.060
I was hoping
you would want that.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.130
{\an1}I mean, yeah,
it's what I want.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.500
I-Is that not...?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.102
I don't know.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.238
{\an3}Most mothers
would want that.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.377
But... you should know...

17:25.444 --> 17:27.112
I am very independent.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.248
And I am just fine

17:29.314 --> 17:30.582
being by myself.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.384
I know.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.653
And I would never go anywhere
where I was not needed.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.321
That's exactly what
I'm saying. We-we...

17:36.388 --> 17:39.391
{\an4}You're saying
that you need me, Tommy?

17:36.388 --> 17:39.391
Y-Yeah.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.059
{\an3}I mean, I-I'm
gonna be traveling,

17:41.126 --> 17:42.327
so I w... I won't be home,

17:42.394 --> 17:44.630
{\an3}and Jen is starting
her business.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.064
{\an3}Sam...

17:46.131 --> 17:48.434
{\an3}He can't pluck and
dress a chicken.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.106
{\an3}I mean, he has to
learn from the best.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.809
You're worse off
than I thought.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.211
Honestly, I...

17:59.278 --> 18:01.847
{\an3}I don't know how we've
been doing it without you.

18:05.484 --> 18:08.420
{\an1}(sighs)
Did you run this by the warden?

18:09.421 --> 18:10.756
Not yet.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.624
I'll have to do that
before it's official.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.660
{\an1}Yeah, well, then I'm not
gonna hold my breath

18:14.726 --> 18:16.662
or drain my waterbed.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.165
It's a big decision.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.167
I have to pick
the right moment to ask her.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.869
Ultimately, it's Jen's call.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.370
{\an5}WATCH:
Calling Jen.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.139
{\an3}(chuckles):
No. No, no. No.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.508
{\an3}Hopefully, she didn't
hear any of that.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.817
{\an3}Okay, I know how much
you care about your mom,

18:38.884 --> 18:41.787
{\an3}but this is a pretty
big bomb to drop.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.388
{\an1}Okay.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.591
{\an5}So, is that a no, or...

18:43.455 --> 18:45.591
I didn't say that.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.659
{\an3}I just wish you had
talked to me about it

18:47.726 --> 18:49.661
{\an3}before you floated
the idea to her.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.530
I switched to two percent milk
without telling you,

18:51.597 --> 18:53.398
and you were mad at me
for a week.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.201
Look, I hear you.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.736
I-If you want to be mad at me
for a week,

18:57.803 --> 18:59.338
I totally get it.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.609
She talked about renting out her
place and giving us the money.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.210
I mean,
that-that could help us out.

19:05.277 --> 19:06.378
Come on, you know
this isn't about the money.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.713
{\an1}I know.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.214
Come on, what do...
what do you think?

19:10.249 --> 19:12.217
I think you're a very sweet man

19:12.284 --> 19:13.785
and an amazing son.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.655
And as much as I think
your mom is a pain in the ass,

19:16.722 --> 19:18.557
I do love her.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.325
And I love you.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.160
Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup.

19:23.762 --> 19:26.565
Just so you know,
there are going to be times

19:26.632 --> 19:28.600
where you see me
just sitting in the car.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.237
Don't come get me.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.774
{\an5}Yes, ma'am.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.774
(chuckles)

19:36.842 --> 19:38.710
This is gonna be bad.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.412
{\an5}Oh, my God.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.412
{\an3}(laughs):
I know.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.748
{\an5}Jen, this is gonna be brutal.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.748
Oh, yeah.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.450
{\an1}But, you know,
we got to make the most of it.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.753
{\an5}Who knows how many Christmases
we have left?

19:45.517 --> 19:47.753
What?

19:47.819 --> 19:50.522
That is terrible. Where
did you get that from?

19:50.589 --> 19:52.558
Where do you think?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.368
(TV playing indistinctly)

20:03.435 --> 20:05.404
Hey. Good news.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.239
{\an1}Lew got me up
to 50 followers,

20:07.306 --> 20:09.942
and when you search my name,
Tom the bowler comes up

20:10.008 --> 20:11.944
before Tom the sailorman.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.347
Couldn't be happier for you.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.851
(clears throat)

20:22.487 --> 20:24.222
Hey, hey. Turn down the hose.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.992
My waterbed
is almost at capacity.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.628
This is great.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.496
Oh, oh, don't touch that TV.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.665
<i>Blue Bloods</i> marathon
is just about to start.
