00:01.333 --> 00:03.333
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.333 --> 00:05.000
SEE, YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND DAWSON.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.708
IN THE MOVIES, THE HERO
ALWAYS PUNCHES OUT
THE BAD GUY.

00:06.708 --> 00:08.625
HE WAS UPSET.
YEAH.

00:08.625 --> 00:11.250
I'M SURE I WOULD BE TOO
IF I LET YOU SLIP
THROUGH MY FINGERS.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.708
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE DECIDED

00:14.708 --> 00:16.291
TO SPEND
SOME TIME APART.

00:16.291 --> 00:18.500
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MOM.
WITH THIS NEW MEDICATION,

00:18.500 --> 00:20.625
SHE'S DOING
SO MUCH BETTER.

00:20.625 --> 00:21.375
MOM PULLED A
SYBIL LAST WEEK.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.291
LET'S AT LEAST BE HONEST.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.417
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.667
NO, I'M NOT.
YOU JUST WANT ME TO BE.

00:26.667 --> 00:27.291
COME HERE.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.125
COME ON, JEN,
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.750
HANG ON. HANG ON.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.917
THAT'S WHY THIS WORLD
IS IN SUCH A MESS.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.208
ALL RIGHT.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.625
DAWSON, YOU CAN
UNCLENCH. I'M DONE.

00:45.625 --> 00:48.333
OK, SO.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.708
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

00:50.708 --> 00:52.125
THE TRUTH.

00:52.125 --> 00:56.125
OK, THE TRUTH TRUTH
OR "THE WHAT DAWSON
WANTS TO HEAR" TRUTH?

00:56.125 --> 00:57.542
SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HATED IT.

00:57.542 --> 01:00.542
NO. HEY, DAWSON, DAWSON,
NO, I DIDN'T HATE IT.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.208
OK, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS,

01:02.208 --> 01:04.542
I DON'T KNOW,
FOR A LACK
OF A BETTER WORD,

01:04.542 --> 01:07.625
UH, FLUFF.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.500
FLUFF?

01:09.500 --> 01:10.208
FLUFF?

01:10.208 --> 01:12.041
HOW CAN IT BE FLUFF, JEN?

01:12.041 --> 01:13.708
MY HEART AND SOUL
WENT INTO THAT SCRIPT.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.708
I'M--I'M JUST
SAYING THAT--

01:15.708 --> 01:17.125
THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR HEART AND SOUL

01:17.125 --> 01:21.333
DEPICTING THE LIVES
AND LOVES OF THESE TEENS
IN A SMALL TOWN

01:21.333 --> 01:25.750
JUST SEEMS LIKE
IT COMES FROM A NAIVE
SORT OF POINT OF VIEW.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.375
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE NAIVE, JEN.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.083
IT'S ABOUT THE MAGIC--

01:29.083 --> 01:32.333
THE AGE OF INNOCENCE,
YOU KNOW.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.125
UH, SEXUAL AWAKENINGS,
THE MAGIC OF FIRST LOVE.

01:35.125 --> 01:40.333
DAWSON, LOOK,
YOUR SCRIPT IS GOOD, OK.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.667
IT'S--IT'S FUNNY
AND IT'S TIMELY

01:43.667 --> 01:45.583
AND IT'S SMART
AND IT'S WELL WRITTEN.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.625
IT'S--IT'S JUST LACKING
RELEVANCE FOR TODAY'S SOCIETY.

01:48.625 --> 01:53.208
AND, I MEAN,
YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO COMMENT ON TEEN LIFE

01:53.208 --> 01:55.750
AND THEN YOU END UP
SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.166
OH.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.959
OH, IF YOU MOVE THAT KNIFE
JUST A HAIR TO YOUR LEFT,

02:01.959 --> 02:03.083
YOU MIGHT GET THE JUGULAR.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.750
OK, COME HERE, COME HERE,
I AM NOT SENDING YOU

02:05.750 --> 02:07.125
SPIRALING
INTO A DEPRESSION HERE.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.208
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
IT'S JUST LACKING
A LITTLE OOMPH.

02:10.208 --> 02:14.959
YOU KNOW, THE ANGER
AND THE EDGE AND THE--

02:14.959 --> 02:17.625
JUST THAT RAW
DARK PAIN THAT COMES
WITH BEING YOUNG.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.750
I AM RAW AND DARK.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.250
HA HA.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.792
WHAT?
OK, IN THEORY,
MAYBE.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.542
IN THEORY MAYBE.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.291
ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT YOU JUST LACK

02:26.291 --> 02:30.000
THE PROOF AND FACTS
TO BACK THAT UP.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.458
PROOF AND FACT.
WHY DO I NEED TO PROVE
THAT I'M RAW AND DARK?

02:32.458 --> 02:34.166
DO I NEED TO, LIKE,
TAKE A GUN TO SCHOOL?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.291
NO, DAWSON.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.667
KILL MY PARENTS?
WHAT EXACTLY?

02:36.667 --> 02:39.792
NO, YOU JUST
NEED TO LOOSEN UP
A LITTLE BIT, OK?

02:39.792 --> 02:40.834
I--

02:40.834 --> 02:42.917
I MEAN, MOVE ON.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.291
START WRITING
FROM THE GUT.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.792
STOP RESPONDING
FROM SUCH AN ADULT
PERSPECTIVE.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.000
AND HOW WOULD YOU
SUGGEST I DO THAT?

02:50.959 --> 02:52.375
TEENAGE 101.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.959
MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT
YOU START PRETENDING

02:54.959 --> 02:56.708
LIKE YOU
REALLY ARE 15.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.333
I THINK--I THINK
THAT I COULD
ACTUALLY SHOW YOU

02:59.333 --> 03:02.291
HOW TO RECLAIM
THOSE MISSING YEARS.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.250
COME ON, DAWSON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.208
JOEY, I WAS HOPING
I'D SEE YOU TODAY.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.875
I MEAN, I SEE YOU
EVERY DAY, BUT YOU KNOW,
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.792
IT'S 7 A.M. CHEER DOWN.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.250
OK, UM, WELL,
LET ME EXPLAIN.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.959
SEE, LAST NIGHT, I HAD
A HARD TIME SLEEPING,

04:04.959 --> 04:07.875
WHICH IS REALLY STRANGE
FOR ME 'CAUSE USUALLY
I'M OUT LIKE A LIGHT.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.917
ANYWAY,
I WAS LAYING THERE,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.417
I HAD THIS EPIPHANY,
AND THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND STRANGE,

04:12.417 --> 04:13.959
BUT IT INVOLVED YOU.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.291
IT'S KIND OF EARLY IN THE DAY
FOR EPIPHANIES, ANDIE,

04:15.291 --> 04:17.666
BUT, WELL,
THANKS FOR SHARING.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.208
LET ME EXPLAIN.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.458
STUDENT COUNCIL
ELECTIONS ARE
AROUND THE CORNER.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.417
I THOUGHT I COULD
MAKE LOTS OF
POSITIVE CHANGES

04:23.417 --> 04:24.708
AS SOPHOMORE
CLASS PRESIDENT.

04:24.708 --> 04:25.959
AND...

04:25.959 --> 04:28.125
AND A REALLY GREAT
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

04:28.125 --> 04:30.458
NEEDS A REALLY GREAT
RUNNING MATE.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.458
AND THAT'S
WHERE YOU COME IN.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.083
NO WAY.
FORGET ABOUT IT, ANDIE.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.583
I DON'T DO
STUDENT GOVERNMENT.

04:35.583 --> 04:36.917
NO, NO, NO, JOEY, LOOK.

04:36.917 --> 04:40.083
I CHECKED YOUR G.P.A.
YOU ARE IN THE TOP 3%
OF THE CLASS.

04:40.083 --> 04:43.083
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO LET THE ACADEMICALLY
LESS FORTUNATE

04:43.083 --> 04:44.708
BENEFIT FROM YOUR WISDOM.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.125
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD, ANDIE,
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY

04:47.125 --> 04:48.583
MISS CONGENIALITY
OF CAPESIDE, OK?

04:48.583 --> 04:49.417
AND ADDING MY NAME
TO YOUR TICKET

04:49.417 --> 04:50.583
WOULD ONLY
ASSURE YOU A LOSS.

04:50.583 --> 04:54.333
EVERYBODY HERE
KNOWS MY SORDID
FAMILY HISTORY.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.125
ON THE HIGH SCHOOL
CHRONOLOGICAL CHART,

04:56.125 --> 04:57.125
IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.959
AND YOUR AVERAGE TEENAGER

04:58.959 --> 05:02.000
HAS AN ATTENTION SPAN
OF JUST UNDER 2 SECONDS.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.417
YOU'VE GOT
A CLEAN SLATE, JOEY,

05:03.417 --> 05:05.083
SO WILL YOU AT LEAST
THINK ABOUT IT?

05:06.959 --> 05:08.959
LOOK, ANDIE,
I'M FLATTERED,

05:08.959 --> 05:12.542
BUT I'D ONLY SCREW UP
YOUR CHANCES. TRUST ME.

05:12.542 --> 05:13.875
I GOTTA GO.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.834
HEY, YOU.

05:19.834 --> 05:20.834
WHAT'S SHAKING, McPHEE?

05:20.834 --> 05:22.250
HEY, MAN. CHRIS AND ABBY
ON ELECTION DAY.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.750
WHEREVER YOU GO, PACEY,
THE SLACKER VOTE
INEVITABLY FOLLOWS.

05:24.750 --> 05:28.125
AND ONCE AGAIN, ABBY,
YOUR NATURALLY
IRREPRESSIBLE CHARM

05:28.125 --> 05:29.166
SHINES ITS WAY THROUGH.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.125
MM-HMM.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.417
FABULOUS. JAMES BOND
AND PUSSY GALORE

05:32.417 --> 05:33.000
ARE GOING
TO RULE OUR CLASS.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.375
NOT NECESSARILY.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.375
WHO'S GONNA
BEAT THEM?

05:36.375 --> 05:37.917
ME.
YEAH, RIGHT.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.542
NO, I'M SERIOUS, PACEY.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.417
WHAT SANE PERSON WOULD
WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME
ON SCHOOL POLITICS

05:42.417 --> 05:45.000
WHEN THEY COULD BE
SPENDING OODLES OF
QUALITY TIME WITH ME?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.834
BECAUSE IT ALL FALLS
INTO MY MASTER PLAN.

05:47.834 --> 05:51.959
SCHOOL POLITICS
LOOKS GREAT ON
COLLEGE APPLICATIONS.

05:51.959 --> 05:53.500
WHO'S YOUR RUNNING MATE
GONNA BE?

05:53.500 --> 05:55.458
STILL WORKING ON
THAT, BUT YOU'RE
GONNA BE

05:55.458 --> 05:56.500
MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.834
I AM?

05:57.834 --> 06:00.000
YES, BECAUSE
I WOULDN'T WANT US

06:00.000 --> 06:01.583
TO MISS OUT ON OUR
OODLES OF QUALITY TIME.

06:11.708 --> 06:12.959
DAWSON, WHAT'S UP?

06:12.959 --> 06:15.000
OH, JUST LIVING
THE SAME OLD PAINLESS,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.542
FLUFF-FILLED
IRRELEVANT EXISTENCE

06:16.542 --> 06:17.708
IN A DULL, NO-EDGE
DARKLESSNESS.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.458
OK, SO WHY DON'T WE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?

06:20.458 --> 06:21.792
LIKE WHAT?

06:21.792 --> 06:23.208
CUT CLASS.
WHAT?

06:23.208 --> 06:26.917
DITCH, BAIL,
LEAVE THE PREMISES
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.083
SOMETHING THE NORMAL STUDENTS
DO AT RANDOM.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.500
NOT EVEN IN THE REALM
OF POSSIBILITY.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.542
WHY NOT?

06:32.542 --> 06:34.208
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T BELIEVE

06:34.208 --> 06:36.125
THAT CUTTING CLASS IS
THAT MISSING EXPERIENCE

06:36.125 --> 06:38.500
THAT WILL UNLEASH
ALL THE ANSWERS
OF THE UNIVERSE TO ME.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.458
AND SECONDLY, I HAVE
A QUIZ IN HISTORY.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.792
OK, SO YOU CAN MAKE
THAT UP TOMORROW.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.291
DAWSON, IN ORDER TO WRITE
ABOUT BEING A TEENAGER,

06:44.291 --> 06:46.166
YOU ACTUALLY NEED
TO EXPERIENCE BEING ONE.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.750
OK, NEXT WEEK.
I PROMISE.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.333
LIFE IS COMPOSED OF MOMENTS,

06:52.333 --> 06:53.458
JUST LIKE YOUR SCRIPT.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.917
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE THOSE
MOMENTS AS THEY COME.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.458
IMPULSIVELY.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.375
OK, THEN LET'S DO IT.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.500
REALLY?
YEAH, LET'S CUT.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.750
IMPULSE.
LET'S GO. COME ON.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.417
ALL RIGHT.
YOU LEAD.

07:16.625 --> 07:20.166
I'M SORRY, MITCH.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO CALL.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.000
IT'S FINISHED.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.542
GO AHEAD. TURN IT ON.
TURN IT TO RINSE.

07:36.166 --> 07:39.333
HA HA HA!

07:47.166 --> 07:48.959
YOU THINK THIS IS
REAL FUNNY, DON'T YOU?

07:48.959 --> 07:50.458
I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.959
I'M SURE YOU DO.

07:51.959 --> 07:52.792
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE DRENCHED.

07:52.792 --> 07:53.875
YEAH, YEAH,
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.542
YOU'RE NOT SO DRY
YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT, HUH?

07:56.542 --> 07:57.792
RIGHT.
YEAH, BUT
LOOK AT YOU.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.625
MITCH?

08:30.041 --> 08:31.708
[CRASH]

08:40.582 --> 08:42.542
[GASPING]

08:49.333 --> 08:51.583
SO, DID YOU INHERIT
YOUR CLUMSY GENE

08:51.583 --> 08:54.500
FROM YOUR MOTHER
OR YOUR FATHER?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.750
I MEAN,
ANDIE'S NOT CLUMSY.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.875
SHE'S A LITTLE HIGH STRUNG,
BUT SHE'S NOT CLUMSY.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.166
OH.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.333
ALL RIGHT,
BEST 2 OUT OF 3.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.834
LOSER CLEANS
THE DEEP FRYER.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.542
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,
I TAKE AFTER MY MOM.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.542
WHO DO YOU TAKE AFTER,
YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR FATHER?

09:10.542 --> 09:11.875
I'M GUESSING IT'S YOUR MOM.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.708
OK, ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.
I'LL CLEAN THE DEEP FRYER.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.458
BUT I'M A LITTLE FUZZY
ON THE PROCESS,

09:16.458 --> 09:17.708
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO,
YOU KNOW, STAY LATE

09:17.708 --> 09:21.959
AND, UH, HELP ME WITH
THE PROPER PROCEDURE.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.333
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
WHAT?

09:25.333 --> 09:28.041
WELL, EVERY TIME I ASK
YOU A QUESTION ABOUT
SOMETHING PERSONAL,

09:28.041 --> 09:31.041
YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
AND NOT ANSWER.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.166
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I PURPOSELY TANKED
THE COFFEE CREAMER TOWER?

09:34.166 --> 09:35.917
JOEY, I'M INSULTED.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.375
SERIOUSLY, JACK. I MEAN,
WE TALK ALL THE TIME,

09:38.375 --> 09:39.542
BUT WHENEVER IT STARTS
TO GET A LITTLE DEEP,

09:39.542 --> 09:42.500
YOU GET ALL
WEIRD AND VAGUE.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.625
YOU KNOW, I HAVE ASKED
YOU 6 QUESTIONS TONIGHT

09:44.625 --> 09:45.959
AND YOU HAVEN'T
ANSWERED ONE?

09:45.959 --> 09:47.417
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO ASK ME 7.

09:47.417 --> 09:50.667
SEE, 7 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.583
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.166
WHY DO YOU MAKE LIGHT
OUT OF EVERYTHING?

09:54.166 --> 09:56.375
BECAUSE I'M ALOOF,
INTROVERTED, AND UNSOCIABLE.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.500
SO THERE, I ANSWERED ONE.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.667
Girl: EXCUSE ME?

09:58.667 --> 10:00.750
COULD WE GET A COUPLE
OF MENUS OVER HERE, PLEASE?

10:09.583 --> 10:14.166
UH, PREFERABLY A COUPLE
WITHOUT YESTERDAY'S SPECIAL
ROTTING ON THEM.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.166
SO, WHY'D YOU BRING ME
TO THIS DIVE?

10:18.166 --> 10:21.708
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
STRATEGY IN PRIVATE

10:21.708 --> 10:24.291
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT
ON THIS PLACE BEING DESERTED.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.375
THE SERVICE HERE
IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FOOD.

10:30.792 --> 10:35.208
SO, YOU'RE CONTENT
ON LETTING THOSE TWO
REPRESENT YOUR CLASS?

10:35.208 --> 10:37.458
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
RUNNING, JACK.

10:37.458 --> 10:41.083
OH, PLEASE, KENNY REILING?
THAT GUY HAS NO CHANCE.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.291
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE
OF CIVIC DUTY?

10:43.291 --> 10:45.750
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I'VE JUST NEVER
REALLY BEEN THE TYPE

10:45.750 --> 10:48.625
TO GET INVOLVED
IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.166
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU WEREN'T REALLY
INTO ART UNTIL RECENTLY.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.125
PEOPLE CHANGE.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.125
YEAH, BUT,
STUDENT GOVERNMENT

10:54.125 --> 10:55.583
IS A HUGE LEAP, JACK.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.125
I MEAN, PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT THERE
FOR PUBLIC SCRUTINY.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.959
YEAH, BUT YOU
SHOULD RUN, JOEY.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.625
ANDIE NEEDS YOU.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S NEW.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.542
IT'LL BE HARD
FOR HER TO GET VOTES,
BUT YOU--

11:03.542 --> 11:06.166
YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING
GIRL NEXT DOOR QUALITY.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.500
BESIDES,
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
FOR YOUR TALENTS
TO RISE TO THE OCCASION.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.458
DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF, JOEY,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE A BORN LEADER.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.834
MORE LIKE BORN LOSER.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.959
YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT
YOU'D HAVE ANY CHANCE
RUNNING AGAINST ME?

11:19.959 --> 11:22.166
GET REAL.
YOU THROW THE TRASH OUT,

11:22.166 --> 11:22.667
YOU DON'T VOTE IT IN.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.291
ABBY, BACK OFF.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.208
WHY, THE TRUTH HURTS?

11:25.208 --> 11:27.208
WELL, IF YOU WANNA
EMBARRASS YOURSELF

11:27.208 --> 11:29.959
AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY
EVEN FURTHER
THAN NATURE INTENDED,

11:29.959 --> 11:33.959
BY ALL MEANS, THROW YOUR
AMAZING GIRL NEXT DOOR
QUALITY INTO THE RING.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.083
HEY, WHAT'S ONE MORE
DISAPPOINTMENT

11:36.083 --> 11:38.000
IN AN ALREADY MEAGER,
DEPRESSING EXISTENCE?

11:40.834 --> 11:41.834
AAH!

11:43.625 --> 11:45.875
YOU'RE DEAD.

11:51.166 --> 11:51.917
TELL ANDIE I'M IN.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.083
OH.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.792
OK, I NEED YOU TO FINISH
PASSING OUT THESE FLYERS

12:13.792 --> 12:15.041
AND GET THESE POSTERS UP.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.542
I WANT THEM ALL OVER CAPESIDE,
NOT JUST THE HIGH SCHOOL.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.834
YOU KNOW, IN A BOOK
I PICKED UP ON
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN,

12:19.834 --> 12:21.667
THEY SAID THIS THING'S
GONNA GET UGLY,

12:21.667 --> 12:22.375
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
START PLAYING--

12:22.375 --> 12:23.750
PACEY?
YEAH.

12:23.750 --> 12:26.917
YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
DOING SOME RESEARCH.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.000
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN A BAD,
BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.750
OH, YOU KNOW,
I WANT THIS CAMPAIGN
TO TAKE A HIGH ROAD.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.834
I STILL BELIEVE A CANDIDATE'S
VIRTUE AND INTEGRITY

12:36.834 --> 12:39.250
IS NORMAL
AND TO BE EXPECTED,

12:39.250 --> 12:42.750
NOT JUST SOME CHARACTER
PERK OR BONUS.

12:42.750 --> 12:46.375
I MEAN, MY GOAL
IS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT
GOOD AND SAFE AGAIN.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.583
MY GOD.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.750
THE WAY THAT
THESE SOUND BITES

12:49.750 --> 12:50.917
JUST FLOW
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,

12:50.917 --> 12:52.875
YOU COULD REALLY HAVE
A FUTURE IN THIS STUFF.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.583
YOUR SINCERITY IS
SO APPEALINGLY SEXY.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.458
AND YOUR SEXINESS IS
SO APPEALINGLY SINCERE.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.417
YOU THINK I'M SEXY, HUH?

13:01.417 --> 13:02.375
WHAT'S SO SEXY ABOUT ME?

13:02.375 --> 13:03.875
HOW SMART YOU ARE.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.250
AHEM.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.125
DID YOU GET A GLIMPSE
OF CHRIS AND ABBY'S
SMEAR CAMPAIGN?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.959
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.708
FINE. WE'LL JUST HIT
THEM BACK HARDER.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.000
THERE'S A WHOLE
CHAPTER IN MY BOOK
ON MUDSLINGING.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
NO, WE ARE NOT STOOPING
TO THEIR LOWS.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.959
GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT
BALANCE AND ORDER.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.458
WE CANNOT LET THEIR
PETTY WAYS USURP US.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.959
THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD ONE.
I SHOULD BE WRITING
THIS DOWN.

13:27.959 --> 13:30.959
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
AT LEAST FIGHT BACK?

13:30.959 --> 13:33.000
AND LET CHRIS AND ABBY
AND THE ENTIRE SCHOOL KNOW

13:33.000 --> 13:36.208
THAT WE RESPOND
IN AN EMOTIONAL,
KNEE-JERK FASHION?

13:36.208 --> 13:39.125
IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGNAL
TO BE SENDING OUT
TO OUR VOTING CONSTITUENTS.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.417
OK, FORGET FIGHTING,
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
STAND UP FOR OURSELVES.

13:42.417 --> 13:43.959
I MEAN--
LOOK, JOEY...

13:43.959 --> 13:46.875
I KNOW THEY GOT TO YOU,
BUT LET'S NOT LET THEM
GET THE BEST OF US.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.125
I MEAN,
THOSE WERE JUST WORDS.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.792
THEY CARRY NO WEIGHT
WHATSOEVER.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.792
NOW, LET'S JUST LOOK
AT OUR DEBATE ISSUES

13:52.792 --> 13:54.792
AND FIGURE OUT
OUR GAME PLAN.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.708
WINNING WILL BE
OUR BEST REVENGE.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.041
SHE WON MY VOTE A FEW
BUMPER STICKERS AGO.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.166
ALL RIGHT, DAWSON

14:10.166 --> 14:12.959
I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS

14:12.959 --> 14:16.750
AND THAT WHAT YOU NEED
IS A REGRESSION SPONSOR.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.500
A WHAT SPONSOR?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.667
SOMEBODY WHO
CAN WALK YOU BACK

14:20.667 --> 14:24.000
THROUGH THE STEPS
OF REGRESSING
INTO YOUR TEEN YEARS.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.625
I'M VERY HUMORED
BY YOUR WHOLE INSIGHT
INTO MY PERSONAL BEING,

14:26.625 --> 14:28.166
BUT I AM
A TEENAGER, OK?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.667
I MEAN, I'VE GOT
NO DRIVER'S LICENSE
TO PROVE IT.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.792
AND PLUS, AND REGARDLESS

14:31.792 --> 14:33.250
OF ANY ADULT
SELF-PERCEPTION
I MIGHT POSSESS,

14:33.250 --> 14:36.291
I STILL HAVE TO FACE
ALL THE TRAUMA
OF BEING MY AGE,

14:36.291 --> 14:38.166
SO I WILL RESPECTFULLY
DECLINE YOUR OFFER.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.750
OK, ALL RIGHT, RESISTANCE
IS EXPECTED. LISTEN.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.375
DAWSON,
THE ENTIRE REASON THAT
I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS PLACE

14:44.375 --> 14:48.458
IS BECAUSE I FIGURED
THAT WE WOULD JUST
START WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.208
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE 10

14:50.208 --> 14:53.083
AND YOUR MOM WOULDN'T
GET YOU THAT CANDY BAR

14:53.083 --> 14:53.959
THAT YOU REALLY,
REALLY WANTED?

14:53.959 --> 14:57.625
DIDN'T YOU EVER
JUST SWIPE IT?

14:57.625 --> 14:59.500
NO.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.083
WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO STEAL SOMETHING?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.875
WE'RE NOT TALKING
GRAND THEFT AUTO HERE.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.125
I'M JUST TALKING
A SNICKERS BAR.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.875
COME ON, DAWSON,
EVERY KID DOES IT
AT LEAST ONCE.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.542
PUT THIS
IN YOUR POCKET, DAWSON.

15:15.542 --> 15:18.083
NO. NO WAY.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.250
DAWSON, COME ON, THIS IS
YOUR SYMBOLIC CANDY BAR.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.667
WHY IS MY
SYMBOLIC CANDY BAR

15:22.667 --> 15:23.667
CRIMSON PASSION
LIPSTICK?

15:23.667 --> 15:25.083
WELL, BECAUSE WE MAY
AS WELL BOTH BENEFIT

15:25.083 --> 15:27.708
FROM YOUR LITTLE
FORAY INTO ADVENTURE.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.417
BESIDES, LOOK,
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.834
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
THAT YOU EXPERIENCE

15:30.834 --> 15:33.625
THE RUSH OF WALKING OUT
WITH IT.

15:33.625 --> 15:37.208
IT'S AN ILLEGAL RUSH
THAT I DON'T HAVE
ANY INTEREST IN, OK?

15:37.208 --> 15:39.625
[SIGHS] DAWSON,
YOU'RE OVERANALYZING AGAIN.

15:39.625 --> 15:43.208
JUST TAKE SAID OBJECT
AND PLACE IT IN YOUR POCKET.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.959
DAWSON, YOU ACTUALLY DID IT.
OH, MY GOD!

15:55.959 --> 15:57.542
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE CAPABLE.

15:57.542 --> 15:58.750
THAT MAKES 2 OF US.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.625
GOD, DON'T YOU JUST
FEEL SO EXHILARATED?

16:01.625 --> 16:05.291
YEAH, I'M ON THIS
AMAZING NATURAL HIGH.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.959
ALL RIGHT, HAND IT OVER.

16:06.959 --> 16:10.250
NO, I'M THE ONE WHO
RISKED INCARCERATION.
I GET TO KEEP IT.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.667
WHAT?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.375
OH, MY GOD.
YOU PUT IT BACK, DIDN'T YOU?

16:16.834 --> 16:18.333
YOU PUT IT BACK, HUH?

16:18.333 --> 16:20.625
LOOK, JEN,
I APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

16:20.625 --> 16:22.792
BUT I LIKE MY
PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE,

16:22.792 --> 16:24.333
REGARDLESS OF
HOW MIDDLE-AGED
IT MIGHT BE.

16:24.333 --> 16:29.083
OK, BUT HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO REACH YOUR AUDIENCE
WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.750
DAWSON, I'VE READ
YOUR SCRIPT, OK?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.166
YOUR HYPER-AWARENESS
IS DISARMING.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.583
YOU'VE GOT TO START
RESPONDING LIKE AN ADOLESCENT

16:34.583 --> 16:38.708
AND STOP HIDING BEHIND
THAT PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.625
WHAT IS WRONG WITH
BEING MATURE FOR MY AGE?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.166
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA
TRAP YOU, DAWSON.

16:43.166 --> 16:46.333
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE UP ONE MORNING
AND YOU'RE GONNA REALIZE

16:46.333 --> 16:47.917
THAT THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT GROWING

16:47.917 --> 16:50.959
IS BECAUSE YOU NEVER
ALLOWED FOR THE PROCESS.

16:50.959 --> 16:52.667
THERE'S A REASON
THAT WE GO FROM
INFANCY TO OLD AGE.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.667
THINK ABOUT THAT.

17:05.666 --> 17:09.040
STUDENTS WITH
A 3.5 OR BETTER G.P.A.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.500
SHOULD HAVE ONLY HALF A DAY
OF CLASSES ON FRIDAY.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.625
I BELIEVE MY RECORD OF
SUPPORT AND INVOLVEMENT
IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES

17:14.625 --> 17:16.541
FULLY QUALIFIES ME
FOR STUDENT OFFICE.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.125
WE'RE QUALIFIED BECAUSE
WE'RE ONE OF YOU.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.666
WE'LL RUN THE SCHOOL
LIKE YOU WANT.

17:19.666 --> 17:22.125
UNLIKE OUR OPPONENTS,
WE HAVEN'T LOST SIGHT
OF THE ISSUES

17:22.125 --> 17:24.583
TO CONCENTRATE
ON CHARACTER ATTACKS.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.458
NEXT QUESTION.

17:26.458 --> 17:29.041
"GIVEN THE TUMULTUOUS
NATURE OF TODAY'S
POLITICAL CLIMATE--"

17:29.041 --> 17:30.583
LISTEN,
IT'S ABOUT TRUST.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.208
LET'S TALK ISSUES.
WALKMANS IN STUDY HALL.

17:33.208 --> 17:36.041
WALKMANS IN STUDY HALL
IS A GREAT IDEA.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.417
I'M A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.

17:37.417 --> 17:40.083
I'VE PROBABLY PARTIED
WITH EVERYONE HERE
AT LEAST ONCE.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.792
[CROWD CHEERS]

17:43.542 --> 17:45.000
THIS ALL COMES DOWN
TO ONE SIMPLE QUESTION.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.208
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO RUN YOUR CLASS?

17:47.208 --> 17:51.375
US, THE GEEKS,
OR LITTLE MISS PERKY

17:51.375 --> 17:52.875
AND THE CONVICT'S
DAUGHTER?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.917
THAT IS SO NOT
A RELEVANT ISSUE, ABBY.

17:54.917 --> 17:58.125
YOU WOULD SAY THAT
CONSIDERING NO ONE HERE
KNOWS YOUR BACKGROUND.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.125
JUST TO BRING EVERYBODY
UP TO SPEED ON AN ISSUE
THAT IS RELEVANT,

18:01.125 --> 18:05.750
ANDIE McPHEE, YOUR
PROSPECTIVE PRESIDENT,

18:05.750 --> 18:09.000
HAS A MOTHER
THAT'S ABOUT, HMM,
ONE SHOCK TREATMENT AWAY

18:09.000 --> 18:10.917
FROM A PERMANENT RESIDENCE
IN THE LOONY BIN.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.417
YOU KNOW, FOR ONCE, ABBY,
LET'S STICK TO THE ISSUES.

18:24.417 --> 18:28.250
YOU KNOW,
ANDIE'S PERSONAL LIFE
HAS NO BEARING

18:28.250 --> 18:31.417
ON HER ABILITY TO HANDLE
THE JOB AS SOPHOMORE
CLASS PRESIDENT.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.875
OH, WHATEVER.
WE HAVE HARD EVIDENCE

18:33.875 --> 18:35.834
THAT ANDIE'S MOTHER
WAS RESPONSIBLE

18:35.834 --> 18:37.417
FOR THE DEATH OF
ANDIE'S OLDER BROTHER

18:37.417 --> 18:38.208
IN A CAR CRASH
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO.

18:38.208 --> 18:41.875
SO, THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS

18:41.875 --> 18:44.125
MOMMY McPHEE IS
A WHACKED OUT NUT.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.625
AND WE ALL KNOW
THAT MENTAL ILLNESS
IS HEREDITARY.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.583
SO, YOU DO THE MATH.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.834
ABBY...

18:50.834 --> 18:51.375
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.792
HEY, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH

18:55.792 --> 18:57.250
FOR THE SAFETY
OF MY FELLOW STUDENTS.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.959
ANDIE?

19:18.834 --> 19:21.166
I--

19:24.000 --> 19:26.041
Andie: UM--

19:27.667 --> 19:29.250
I--

19:58.834 --> 20:00.458
HEY.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.625
I CAN'T FIND ANDIE.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

20:02.625 --> 20:03.667
SO, YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE ASSEMBLY?

20:03.667 --> 20:06.000
YEAH.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.500
LOOK, I FEEL
REALLY STUPID.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.875
I MEAN, GRILLING YOU
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY,

20:10.875 --> 20:11.959
PRESSURING YOU
FOR ANSWERS.

20:11.959 --> 20:12.834
I'M REALLY SORRY, JACK.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.458
JOEY, I'M LOOKING
FOR MY SISTER,

20:14.458 --> 20:15.917
NOT YOUR SYMPATHY,
ALL RIGHT?

20:16.875 --> 20:19.166
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE THE DEBATE.

20:19.166 --> 20:19.542
GREAT.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.917
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.250
MY FAMILY SITUATION
IS COMPLICATED,
ALL RIGHT?

20:26.250 --> 20:28.583
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I FEEL COMFORTABLE
TALKING ABOUT,

20:28.583 --> 20:29.667
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.542
NO, JACK, DON'T
PUSH ME AWAY, OK?

20:31.542 --> 20:32.583
I WANT TO HELP.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.208
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

20:34.208 --> 20:35.834
WITH MY FAMILY,
AND I UNDERSTAND.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.208
ALL RIGHT,
DON'T YOU GET IT?

20:37.208 --> 20:39.917
I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
BEFORE AND I DON'T NOW.

20:39.917 --> 20:40.375
GOD!

20:54.166 --> 20:55.583
HA HA.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.458
ANDIE...
YOU IN THERE?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.208
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,
I'M COMING IN THERE

21:05.208 --> 21:07.500
AND JUST SO THERE IS
NO CONFUSION,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.667
I AM A MAN, SO IF THERE
ARE ANY OBJECTIONS,

21:09.667 --> 21:11.458
PLEASE SPEAK NOW.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.500
ANDIE, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN HERE.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.959
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A WHOLE CHAPTER
IN MY BOOK

21:20.959 --> 21:23.625
ON WHAT TO DO
WHEN SCANDAL BREAKS.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.125
THIS IS NOT SUCH
A BIG DEAL.

21:26.125 --> 21:30.500
I MEAN, YOU AND I,
WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.083
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.792
YOU AND ME, ANDIE.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.917
DID YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S EXACTLY 60' 6"

21:44.917 --> 21:46.583
FROM PITCHING MOUND
TO HOME PLATE?

21:49.083 --> 21:50.667
ARE YOU OK, McPHEE?

21:50.667 --> 21:53.166
TIM TAUGHT ME THAT.

21:53.166 --> 21:57.000
HE TRIED TO TEACH ME
A CURVE BALL, TOO.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.500
TURNS OUT,
I THROW LIKE A GIRL.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.375
COME ON. LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE, ANDIE.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.583
OH, GOD, PACEY.

22:08.583 --> 22:09.625
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,

22:09.625 --> 22:12.750
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT
MY MOM AND ABOUT TIM.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.542
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GO
OUT THERE IN THE HALL?

22:16.542 --> 22:18.333
I MEAN, EVERYBODY'S
GOING TO LOOK AT ME

22:18.333 --> 22:19.500
AND THEY'RE ALL
GOING TO LAUGH.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.500
NO ONE'S GOING
TO LAUGH AT YOU, ANDIE.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
EVERYBODY COMES FROM
A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.
IT'S THE NINETIES.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.667
THE ONLY HAPPY FAMILIES
ARE IN TV SYNDICATION.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.500
BUT IT'S ALL RUINED.

22:29.500 --> 22:34.208
I MEAN, POLITICS USED
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

22:35.291 --> 22:42.583
NOW, WE'VE JUST BECOME
SUCH A LESSON SOCIETY.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.000
ANDIE, THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.417
I MEAN, TRUST ME,
ME OF ALL PEOPLE.

22:46.417 --> 22:47.583
THIS WILL ALL BLOW OVER.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.875
TOMORROW, EVERYTHING
GOES BACK TO NORMAL.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.291
NORMAL?

22:55.333 --> 22:58.959
OH, GOD. THAT'S ALL
I EVER WANTED, YOU KNOW.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.458
A NORMAL FAMILY
WITH A NORMAL LIFE,

23:01.458 --> 23:03.250
BALANCE AND ORDER,
ORDER AND BALANCE.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.917
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT JUST DOESN'T EXIST.

23:04.917 --> 23:05.917
I MEAN, NOT ANYWHERE.
NOT HERE.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.333
AND--AND IT NEVER WILL
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

23:08.333 --> 23:11.792
IT WAS ALL JUST
THIS BIG FALSE HOPE.

23:11.792 --> 23:14.166
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON YOURSELF?

23:14.166 --> 23:17.708
NORMAL NEVER EXISTED.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.250
IT NEVER DID.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.166
[SIGHS]

23:22.166 --> 23:26.083
WOW, LOOK AT ME.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.708
I'M A MESS.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.834
I'M A TOTAL
AND COMPLETE MESS.

23:35.542 --> 23:37.458
WHOO.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.917
[SIGHS]

23:45.917 --> 23:47.625
I HATE THIS.

23:49.834 --> 23:52.625
I REALLY HATE THIS!

24:03.417 --> 24:05.083
DAWSON.
HEY, DAD.

24:05.083 --> 24:08.583
HEY, LOOK, CAN YOU BELIEVE
SOMEBODY THREW THIS OUT?

24:08.583 --> 24:09.750
THE THING'S AN ANTIQUE.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.917
THOUGHT MAYBE I'D
CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.000
SELL IT.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.166
BROUGHT YOUR MAIL.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.542
THANKS. YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

24:17.542 --> 24:20.458
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THOUGHT I'D STOP BY,

24:20.458 --> 24:22.750
SAY HI,
SEE WHAT WAS NEW.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.125
IF ANYTHING.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.125
MOM TOLD YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

24:26.125 --> 24:30.208
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
I SAW IT FOR MYSELF.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.208
NOT THE MAIN ATTRACTION,

24:32.208 --> 24:33.667
JUST THE PREVIEWS.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.083
SO?

24:35.083 --> 24:36.667
SO, UH--

24:39.417 --> 24:41.834
IT'S COMPLICATED AND, UM...

24:41.834 --> 24:45.250
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY HOW COMFORTABLE I AM

24:45.250 --> 24:46.625
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.625
NO PROBLEM. THAT'S--
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.417
I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M OK WITH IT.

24:50.417 --> 24:53.291
IT'S FINE IF YOU
WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

24:53.291 --> 24:55.125
STAY OVER EVERY
ONCE IN AWHILE.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.375
IT WON'T MESS
WITH MY HEAD,

24:56.375 --> 24:58.625
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THAT.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.625
I MEAN,
I KNOW THAT, HA HA,

25:00.625 --> 25:03.166
RECONCILIATIONS
HAVE THEIR STRAINED
AND VARIED PATHS.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.083
THERE IS NO RECONCILIATION,
DAWSON.

25:05.083 --> 25:07.750
IT WAS A SLIP.

25:07.750 --> 25:11.500
A SEX SLIP
AND A MISTAKE AND...

25:11.500 --> 25:13.166
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

25:13.166 --> 25:14.708
NOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.667
WELL, WE--WE JUST--
WE FELL BACK INTO
WHAT WAS COMFORTABLE

25:21.667 --> 25:27.500
AND--AND EASY AND USED IT
TO COVER OUR PROBLEMS.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.166
MAYBE IT HELPED
YOUR PROBLEMS.

25:29.166 --> 25:29.667
NO.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.542
NO, IT WORSENED THEM.

25:32.542 --> 25:37.708
BECAUSE I REALIZE
THAT IT'S INSANE

25:37.708 --> 25:40.500
TO KEEP TAKING
THE SAME ACTION,

25:40.500 --> 25:42.750
EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.166
I MEAN, IT CHANGES NOTHING.

25:47.041 --> 25:51.708
IT'S THE ACTION
THAT MUST CHANGE.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.375
YOU WERE RIGHT. I DO HAVE
A PERCEPTION DISORDER.

25:58.375 --> 26:01.542
WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?

26:01.542 --> 26:05.250
LET'S JUST SAY I'M GEARED
TO RESPOND TO LIFE
IN A CERTAIN WAY.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.875
AND YOU SAY
THAT I DON'T RESPOND
LIKE A TYPICAL ADOLESCENT.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.333
AND--AND YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T.

26:09.333 --> 26:12.542
BUT EMOTIONALLY, I DO.
I ALWAYS HAVE.

26:12.542 --> 26:15.542
I'M--I'M VERY MUCH
MY AGE EMOTIONALLY,
MAYBE EVEN YOUNGER.

26:15.542 --> 26:18.834
AND MY FEELINGS ARE IN
CONSTANT CONFLICT

26:18.834 --> 26:22.041
WITH--WITH MY OVERACHIEVING
SELF-AWARE BRAIN AND I--

26:22.041 --> 26:27.250
IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.417
I'M JUST--
AM I MAKING ANY SENSE?

26:29.417 --> 26:30.500
COMPLETELY.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.667
OK, THANK GOD.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.750
SO, I KEEP ON WAITING
FOR MY FEELINGS TO CATCH UP

26:35.750 --> 26:39.291
SO THAT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
I CAN FINALLY GROW UP

26:39.291 --> 26:42.041
AND I CAN FINALLY
GET OVER JOEY,

26:42.041 --> 26:44.917
OR ACCEPT THAT MY PARENTS
MAY OR MAY NOT WORK THINGS OUT,

26:44.917 --> 26:48.750
OR JUST--BUT I THINK
I HAVE IT BACKWARDS.

26:48.750 --> 26:53.291
OK, IN ORDER TO CHANGE
THE FEELINGS,

26:53.291 --> 26:55.333
I FIRST HAVE TO CHANGE
MY ACTIONS

26:55.333 --> 26:56.250
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

26:56.250 --> 26:58.166
SOMEBODY CAN CHANGE
HOW THEY FEEL.

26:59.542 --> 27:01.875
YOU ARE TOO SMART FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, DAWSON.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.083
RIGHT NOW, JEN,
I FEEL INCREDIBLY STUPID.

27:10.959 --> 27:13.041
IS THERE--
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?

27:13.041 --> 27:14.667
OR...I DON'T KNOW.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.125
I THINK I NEED A SPONSOR.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.875
I NEED TO GO OUT
AND ENGAGE IN SOME...

27:20.875 --> 27:24.583
INCREDIBLY APPROPRIATE
TEENAGE BEHAVIOR.

27:25.959 --> 27:29.125
WELL, SOUNDS
LIKE SOMETHING
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.834
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
SPECIFIC IN MIND?

27:30.834 --> 27:35.417
UH, JUST SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, NONSENSICAL,
COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS,

27:35.417 --> 27:36.875
THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.000
YOU ARE THE EXPERT.
I WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BY ALL MEANS, DAWSON,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.875
LET THE REVELRY BEGIN.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.125
I FINALLY
GOT MOM TO BED.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.917
IT REALLY SCARES HER
TO SEE YOU SO UPSET.

28:26.208 --> 28:29.000
LOOK, ANDIE,
THIS HASN'T BEEN AN
EASY YEAR FOR ANY OF US.

28:30.583 --> 28:34.000
BUT WE ALL DO
WHAT WE HAVE TO
TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.375
TO COPE.

28:40.959 --> 28:43.667
YOUR HIGHS AND LOWS
ARE BECOMING REALLY
INTENSE LATELY.

28:43.667 --> 28:44.542
I'M FINE, JACK.

28:44.542 --> 28:47.917
NO, YOU'RE
NOT FINE, ANDIE.

28:47.917 --> 28:48.667
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE
YOU'RE LAUGHING,

28:48.667 --> 28:49.750
THE NEXT
YOU'RE IN TEARS.

28:49.750 --> 28:53.792
PLEASE,
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, OK?

28:59.208 --> 29:02.667
I THINK MAYBE IT'S
TIME YOU WENT BACK
ON YOUR MEDICATION.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.792
IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU
AND FOR EVERYONE.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.750
I SAID I'M ALL RIGHT, OK?
I JUST HAD A ROUGH DAY.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.083
THAT'S ALL.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.500
REALLY, I DON'T NEED
ANY MEDICATION.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.500
I'M FINE.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.417
[LAUGHING]

29:55.417 --> 29:58.792
SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.
I THINK WE'RE SAFE.

29:58.792 --> 30:00.708
WE JUST TP'd
MR. MILO'S HOUSE.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.166
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO THAT.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.458
AND NOW YOU HAVE.
SEE, AND VERY WELL,
I MIGHT ADD.

30:04.458 --> 30:06.917
THANK YOU.

30:06.917 --> 30:09.000
ASIDE FROM THE FACT
THAT YOU FORGOT
TO DROP THE EVIDENCE.

30:11.583 --> 30:14.959
WHOO! ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S
A REBELLIOUS 13, I WOULD SAY.

30:14.959 --> 30:15.959
[CLEARS THROAT]

30:15.959 --> 30:16.917
WHAT'S NEXT?

30:16.917 --> 30:18.458
YOU READY FOR
SOMETHING REALLY BOLD?

30:18.458 --> 30:19.542
I AM UP FOR ANYTHING.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.625
ANYTHING?

30:20.625 --> 30:22.625
AB--WELL, WHAT DID YOU
HAVE IN MIND?

30:22.625 --> 30:23.708
DROP YOUR PANTS.

30:23.708 --> 30:26.417
WHAT?

30:26.417 --> 30:28.291
WELL, I JUST MEAN
THAT YOU CAN'T VERY WELL

30:28.291 --> 30:30.041
GO SKINNY DIPPING
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.375
SKINNY DIPPING?
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW COLD THE WATER IS?

30:32.375 --> 30:35.667
OH, WELL, IF YOU'RE
TOO EMBARRASSED ABOUT--

30:35.667 --> 30:39.667
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.
I'M JUST--

30:39.667 --> 30:40.333
YOU THINK I WON'T DO IT,
DON'T YOU?

30:40.333 --> 30:42.166
NO.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.041
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING IN ALONE.

30:44.041 --> 30:47.291
DAWSON, I NEVER INTENDED
FOR YOU TO DO IT ALONE.

30:48.417 --> 30:50.000
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.083
COMPLETELY.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.000
I'VE--

30:52.000 --> 30:53.792
MAYBE WE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT THIS.

30:53.792 --> 30:55.792
WHAT IF SOMEBODY
WALKS--WALKS BY?

30:55.792 --> 30:58.792
YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, THEN--

31:08.500 --> 31:10.375
JEN, YOU'RE...

31:10.375 --> 31:13.500
NAKED? HA HA.

31:14.834 --> 31:15.834
AND ALL WET.

31:17.041 --> 31:20.125
DAWSON, COME ON IN.
THE WATER'S GREAT.

31:22.708 --> 31:25.041
HA HA HA.

31:32.792 --> 31:33.875
DAWSON,
IS THAT A TREE BRANCH

31:33.875 --> 31:36.375
OR ARE YOU JUST
HAPPY TO SEE ME?

31:36.375 --> 31:38.166
INSPIRED.
NOW TURN AROUND.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.083
ALL RIGHT, I AM.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.708
OK, HERE I COME.

31:44.375 --> 31:47.542
HA HA HA.

31:47.542 --> 31:48.625
WHOO!

31:48.625 --> 31:50.542
ALL RIGHT!

31:52.125 --> 31:54.792
HA HA.

31:54.792 --> 31:56.083
ONLY 2 DAYS AGO,

31:56.083 --> 31:58.250
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.208
OH, THANKS A LOT.
SWIMMING NAKED WITH ME

32:01.208 --> 32:02.834
WOULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE?

32:02.834 --> 32:04.583
NO, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

32:11.291 --> 32:15.792
OK, OK, OK, DAWSON,
DAWSON, TRUCE, TRUCE.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.792
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

32:23.792 --> 32:26.083
NIGHTMARES ASIDE,

32:26.083 --> 32:30.834
HAVE YOU EVER
DREAMT ABOUT ME?

32:30.834 --> 32:32.417
YEAH.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.917
I MEAN, EVERYONE I KNOW,
YOU KNOW,

32:33.917 --> 32:36.291
HAS CREPT INTO MY DREAMS
AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER.

32:36.291 --> 32:39.083
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN. I MEAN--

32:41.208 --> 32:45.041
HAVE YOU EVER
WOKEN UP SWEATING?

32:45.041 --> 32:48.792
YOUR BLANKET IN
A LITTLE PUP TENT?

32:48.792 --> 32:52.000
YOU FIRST. HAVE YOU
DREAMT ABOUT ME THAT WAY?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.417
POSSIBLY.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.250
DAWSON.

33:00.250 --> 33:02.250
WHAT?

33:02.250 --> 33:04.250
CROSSING THE LINE.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.458
CROSSING THE LINE?
YOU DON'T WANT--

33:06.458 --> 33:08.875
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED THIS, JEN.

33:08.875 --> 33:13.333
YOU, I MEAN, YOU'VE HINTED.
I MEAN, IMPLIED, OFFERED.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.333
I KNOW, DAWSON,
IT'S JUST--

33:15.333 --> 33:16.000
I WAS JUST
TAKING YOUR ADVICE.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.792
I MEAN, DON'T THINK, DO.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.917
JUST SOMETHING COMPLETELY
SPONTANEOUS, YOU KNOW.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.875
LOOK, I'M GLAD THAT
YOU'VE EMBRACED
THE PHILOSOPHY.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
WE'RE FINALLY
FRIENDS NOW,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.834
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MESS THAT UP.

33:30.667 --> 33:33.041
I DON'T KNOW,
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
YOUR LEAD ON THIS ONE,

33:33.041 --> 33:36.542
HOPING THAT
DIFFERENT ACTIONS

33:36.542 --> 33:38.333
MIGHT CREATE
DIFFERENT RESULTS.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.500
SO THE DIFFERENT ACTION
IS TAKING NO ACTION?

33:44.500 --> 33:49.875
NO. NO, THE DIFFERENT ACTION
IS BEING YOUR FRIEND.

33:52.458 --> 33:55.041
THE WAY JOEY WAS MY FRIEND?

33:55.041 --> 33:58.792
THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS
TO BE SOMEONE'S FRIEND,
DAWSON.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.125
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

34:05.291 --> 34:07.375
HA HA HA. HA HA HA.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.375
I BROUGHT THE EASTERN
SECTION CHAMPIONSHIP
TO CAPESIDE,

34:11.375 --> 34:14.208
NOW I'LL APPROACH
MY PRESIDENCY
WITH THE SAME DRIVE.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.958
