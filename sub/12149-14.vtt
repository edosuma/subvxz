WEBVTT

00:10.929 --> 00:12.119
Mark of Kekfadlorem.

00:14.529 --> 00:15.369
Heard of it, never seen it.

00:16.929 --> 00:20.859
This is the only knife that can
kill a Kek demon. Could be useful.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.309
Only if Kek demons weren't extinct.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.829
They are? Oh, dear.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.929
Well, perhaps there's one hibernating.

00:31.929 --> 00:34.810
Ready to awaken and
embark on a grisly rampage.

00:35.530 --> 00:36.609
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.710
They're done! Nobody touch!

00:41.530 --> 00:43.810
- She's making brownies.
- Is that what I smell?

00:46.929 --> 00:48.859
I thought I'd tracked something in.

00:49.329 --> 00:51.219
This was handed down by my mother...

00:51.729 --> 00:55.060
...from her housekeeper.
I improvised. You're gonna love them.

00:55.929 --> 00:56.700
Me?

00:57.130 --> 01:00.009
Doesn't Angel have to--?
Get to try any?

01:00.729 --> 01:03.079
They're brownies,
not red blood cells.

01:04.328 --> 01:05.840
Oh, I wasn't thinking.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.480
More a drinker
than an eater, I suppose.

01:12.730 --> 01:16.379
Maybe if he branched into solids,
he'd keep a decent knife around.

01:19.930 --> 01:23.409
That is not appropriate!
It's for killing extinct demons.

01:24.129 --> 01:25.810
- Angel, make her stop.
- Cordelia--

01:26.530 --> 01:29.939
That blade is old. Who knows what
effect her cooking may have on it?

01:30.730 --> 01:31.920
"Effect"?

01:32.530 --> 01:34.530
Cordelia, put down
the very sharp knife.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.510
Well, they don't smell right.

01:36.730 --> 01:40.170
I think Mr. Too Much Cologne is the
pot calling the kettle stinky.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.859
Cordelia! Doyle!

01:45.730 --> 01:47.900
I mean, um, Wesley.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.560
Wesley.

01:55.930 --> 01:57.120
Let's just, um....

01:58.329 --> 02:00.049
No more fighting, all right?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.780
- Where is it, Stephanie?
- What?

02:10.930 --> 02:12.889
I didn't take it!
Give me that. Stop it!

02:13.330 --> 02:15.400
- You took my card!
- I didn't touch it!

02:16.330 --> 02:18.750
- What'd you do with it?
- Stop it! Mom!

02:19.330 --> 02:20.770
Okay. That's it.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.569
- She took my card.
- I did not!

02:22.930 --> 02:24.960
You did! I had five
and now I have four.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.210
There are children
in India who have three.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.210
- It's time for bed, anyway.
- Mom! No!

02:31.930 --> 02:33.539
You heard your mother.

02:34.930 --> 02:35.979
It's time for bed.

03:04.330 --> 03:05.379
Do we have to?

04:17.970 --> 04:19.930
Pretend to read any good books lately?

04:20.970 --> 04:22.509
I thought you went home.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.529
You called him Doyle.

04:32.970 --> 04:36.449
It just happened.
I hope Wesley's okay with it.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.500
Who cares about him? This is about
Doyle. You never say his name.

04:42.569 --> 04:43.939
- I say it.
- No, you don't.

04:46.769 --> 04:49.860
Look, you don't have to
be Joe Stoic about his dying.

04:50.370 --> 04:53.850
I mean, I know you have this
unflappable vibe working for you.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.430
But you don't have
to do that for me.

04:56.970 --> 04:59.319
- I'm not unflappable.
- Great. So flap.

05:16.170 --> 05:17.220
I miss him.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.759
Me too.

05:21.569 --> 05:24.170
I've been around death before. A lot.

05:25.769 --> 05:27.800
I've lost people, I've killed people.

05:28.170 --> 05:29.540
And you are dead.

05:31.769 --> 05:32.639
Sorry.

05:33.569 --> 05:35.529
I shouldn't have let it happen.

05:35.970 --> 05:37.410
Angel, it wasn't your fault.

05:40.769 --> 05:42.730
- It hurts.
- Yeah.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.290
No, it, it really, really, really--

05:56.370 --> 05:57.350
Easy.

06:01.769 --> 06:02.959
What'd you see?

06:09.569 --> 06:10.970
1256. That's the house.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.490
Angel?

06:26.970 --> 06:28.439
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

06:28.769 --> 06:30.000
You're bleeding.

06:30.569 --> 06:31.579
Are you gonna cry?

06:33.569 --> 06:34.620
I don't think so.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.329
I don't know.

06:40.170 --> 06:41.040
Let me think....

06:41.970 --> 06:43.129
Uh, no.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.420
No, not gonna cry.

06:46.769 --> 06:48.100
- What's your name?
- Ryan.

06:48.569 --> 06:51.060
Ryan, you want to tell me
what you were doing outside?

06:52.170 --> 06:53.250
Ryan!

06:55.170 --> 06:56.639
You know better than this.

06:58.170 --> 07:01.079
Now say thank you
to the nice man and come inside.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.290
Ryan!

07:02.970 --> 07:05.850
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What happened?

07:06.569 --> 07:09.759
He was in the street. He almost
got hit. Paige, he's fine.

07:10.170 --> 07:11.220
Oh, God, my baby.

07:11.970 --> 07:13.550
It's cold. Let's get him inside.

07:13.769 --> 07:15.870
You saved him.
Thank God you were here.

07:19.769 --> 07:22.120
- Yeah, uh, thank you.
- It's okay.

07:26.370 --> 07:27.240
Scamp, isn't he?

07:28.769 --> 07:30.209
Oh, you're hurt. Your shoulder.

07:34.769 --> 07:36.209
You come inside.

07:39.569 --> 07:41.959
You scared me.

07:45.209 --> 07:47.490
Sure you don't want to
go to the emergency room?

07:48.209 --> 07:49.649
You may need some stitches.

07:50.009 --> 07:53.100
It'll be fine, really.
I'm not a big bleeder.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.730
We just moved in.
We're still a bit jumbled.

07:59.009 --> 08:02.339
It doesn't get any easier. Every new
place, you have to start over...

08:03.810 --> 08:04.680
...finding friends...

08:06.209 --> 08:07.930
...people to talk to.

08:14.009 --> 08:16.220
Ryan's asleep. He's out like a light.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.370
He seems like a nice boy.

08:23.009 --> 08:25.500
He is. Thank you so much.

08:26.610 --> 08:29.310
That must be the millionth time
I've said that.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.110
Really, thank you.

08:32.610 --> 08:35.700
If there's anything we can do
for you.... Money?

08:36.210 --> 08:39.120
Seth's an investment adviser.
Do you need some advice?

08:40.409 --> 08:42.269
No, nothing. Thank you.

08:42.808 --> 08:45.690
He probably just wants to
go home and get cleaned up.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.820
How did Ryan get in the street?

08:50.009 --> 08:51.169
Climbed out the window.

08:54.809 --> 08:58.220
We have burglar bars. But he
must be able to fit between.

08:59.009 --> 09:00.940
We didn't even bother checking that.

09:01.409 --> 09:02.570
Where was he going?

09:02.610 --> 09:04.190
Going?
He wasn't going anywhere.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.870
Think he was trying
to get away from something?

09:08.009 --> 09:10.149
Why would he want to get away from
his own house?

09:42.809 --> 09:43.860
Oh, dear.

09:50.009 --> 09:51.940
- This bother you?
- No.

09:52.409 --> 09:53.879
Lot of health nuts these days.

09:55.409 --> 09:57.299
Like anyone needs to live forever.

09:57.809 --> 09:59.039
No one needs that.

10:05.610 --> 10:08.029
She'll be right back with
the bandages, then you can go.

10:08.610 --> 10:09.659
Right.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.029
Paige was telling me
you're new in town.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.049
- Where did you--?
- What?

10:20.009 --> 10:21.409
This was much worse.

10:21.809 --> 10:23.320
Oh, it's just a scratch.

10:23.610 --> 10:25.960
Seth was telling me
about where you lived before.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.860
Akron. One winter there was enough.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.980
You know what? Strikes me
you never told us your name.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.190
Angel.

10:39.809 --> 10:41.950
Jones. Angel Jones.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.350
Angel.

10:44.610 --> 10:45.620
Honey?

10:50.009 --> 10:50.879
See?

10:53.009 --> 10:54.059
Angels.

10:54.809 --> 10:58.179
I collect them. I think they're
around all the time, don't you?

10:59.610 --> 11:00.799
I think...

11:02.009 --> 11:03.730
...there are beings.

11:03.809 --> 11:06.370
It's a nice thought.
Like someone's looking out for us.

11:06.809 --> 11:09.789
Keeping us out of danger.
Tonight you were our angel.

11:11.009 --> 11:12.659
I was just in the right place.

11:14.009 --> 11:15.059
It's getting late.

11:20.610 --> 11:21.940
- Come to dinner.
- Paige.

11:22.409 --> 11:26.269
Tomorrow night. Say yes. Let us
pay you back for looking after us.

11:26.610 --> 11:28.679
We've taken up too much
of Angel's time already.

11:31.409 --> 11:32.320
Can I bring something?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.009
Something's wrong in that house.

11:41.009 --> 11:43.679
The wife wants to talk,
but the husband doesn't.

11:44.610 --> 11:45.590
I'll be back tomorrow.

11:45.809 --> 11:46.929
- Be careful.
- I am.

11:47.009 --> 11:48.970
Be especially careful.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.210
Plakticine.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.539
- I found it all around the house.
- So now we know.

11:55.409 --> 11:57.370
Someone in there
is possessed by a demon.

12:10.649 --> 12:12.019
Thanks for your help.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.259
Mom told the truth about Akron.

12:15.450 --> 12:18.960
Before that, Miami and Baton Rouge.
All within the last three years.

12:19.649 --> 12:21.899
Let me guess. Couldn't
lose the black cloud.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.549
Like it was fitted with chinstraps.

12:25.049 --> 12:27.750
Everywhere they go, there's been
reports of disturbances, and...

12:28.049 --> 12:29.309
...yuck, animal deaths.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.000
In Akron, a friend of the family
went missing. He's still missing.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.840
What is this stuff anyway?
It's kind of pretty.

12:40.049 --> 12:42.470
It's the bodily
excretion of an Ethros demon.

12:44.850 --> 12:47.590
No one could've said "demon poo"
before I touched it?

12:47.850 --> 12:50.480
It can't hurt you. Only
the demon itself is dangerous.

12:51.450 --> 12:52.460
How dangerous?

12:52.649 --> 12:54.929
Tends to go in for mass murder.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.110
Remember Lizzie Borden?
Killed her parents with an ax?

12:58.649 --> 13:01.669
I remember the children's rhyme.
Why are they full of death...

13:02.250 --> 13:04.919
...and cradles falling
and mice getting tails cut off?

13:05.850 --> 13:08.450
The whole thing needs
a rating system. Don't you think?

13:09.450 --> 13:10.679
Yes, well....

13:11.250 --> 13:14.059
What the rhyme doesn't say is,
she was possessed by an Ethros.

13:14.850 --> 13:17.379
An adolescent Ethros.
This amount of plakticine...

13:19.049 --> 13:20.490
...we've got a grown-up demon.

13:20.850 --> 13:23.970
Someone's got a squatter in their
head. What do we do about it?

13:24.450 --> 13:25.529
Evict him.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.620
Exorcism.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.639
I'll find someone
who can perform one.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.500
Not too many priests
go in for it these days.

13:34.649 --> 13:36.580
Who do we exorcize?
Which one's the demon?

13:37.049 --> 13:38.450
They were afraid of the father.

13:38.850 --> 13:41.799
A father doesn't have to be possessed
to terrorize his children.

13:42.450 --> 13:43.850
He just has to--

13:46.049 --> 13:47.730
We'll find out soon enough.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.639
The first step is getting
him to show himself.

13:52.649 --> 13:55.559
A little Psylis Eucalipsis powder
ingested by the host--

13:56.250 --> 13:59.759
And what? Dad goes
"Rrrr," head spins around?

14:00.450 --> 14:01.360
Essentially.

14:01.649 --> 14:04.740
Okay, so how do I get
someone to eat Eucalipsis powder?

14:08.090 --> 14:09.279
I made brownies.

14:12.889 --> 14:14.009
More Brussels sprouts?

14:16.490 --> 14:18.169
No, thank you. I'm full.

14:19.490 --> 14:21.809
Everything was...very good.

14:23.690 --> 14:24.740
Roast was a little dry.

14:24.889 --> 14:28.149
No. It was full of roasty goodness.

14:32.690 --> 14:35.080
I think we're ready
to try your brownies.

14:36.889 --> 14:38.470
I'll get the coffee.

14:47.690 --> 14:50.220
I didn't like the Brussels sprouts.
They were gross.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.480
You seemed to like yours.

14:57.889 --> 14:59.639
I hid one in my mashed potatoes too.

15:02.090 --> 15:04.049
- What are you laughing at?
- Angel's funny.

15:05.690 --> 15:06.740
He hides it well.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.429
Look, kids. See what Angel
made for us?

15:27.889 --> 15:31.610
- What's your secret, Angel?
- I use chocolate.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.419
That's why they're brown.

15:34.490 --> 15:36.029
Which gives them their name:

15:38.090 --> 15:39.250
Brownies!

15:40.490 --> 15:42.950
No hot chocolate tonight.
This is your treat.

15:43.490 --> 15:44.860
- Dad!
- It's not fair.

15:45.289 --> 15:47.539
Kids, shh. Company.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.059
Ryan! What's wrong?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.960
Your son's possessed by a demon.

16:20.809 --> 16:21.789
Ryan's bad.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.679
- Ryan's always been bad.
- Stephanie!

16:26.809 --> 16:27.970
Baby....

16:28.610 --> 16:29.549
Do you hear me?

16:30.409 --> 16:33.080
- Paige, listen. He's okay.
- What do you mean, he's okay?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.110
- The demon had to show itself first.
- You did this to him?

16:37.009 --> 16:38.379
I just used the brownies to--

16:38.809 --> 16:41.090
You put something in
our food, you poisoned him?

16:41.809 --> 16:43.389
What were you thinking?

16:44.809 --> 16:47.759
I thought you were here
to help us. You're not an angel.

16:49.009 --> 16:49.990
Paige, it's okay.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.610
Seth, he did this to Ryan.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.330
We both know that is not true.

16:55.009 --> 16:57.570
What's wrong with Ryan
has been wrong for a long time.

16:59.809 --> 17:01.389
You say you can help my son?

17:02.809 --> 17:03.679
All right.

17:05.210 --> 17:06.368
What do you need?

17:06.410 --> 17:07.490
A phone.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.009
I found our demon in the boy.

17:12.410 --> 17:15.819
We're not ready. I have a priest,
but we can't find him.

17:16.608 --> 17:19.170
I need a binding powder.
Everything is in the pantry.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.740
We can hold him for a while.
We're coming to you.

17:26.809 --> 17:27.970
How is she?

17:28.609 --> 17:31.069
She's just....
It's been so long.

17:31.609 --> 17:32.839
This isn't gonna be easy.

17:33.410 --> 17:34.849
For the last three years...

17:35.210 --> 17:37.910
...it's been all I could do
to hold this family together.

17:39.410 --> 17:42.890
Now you come here and give us
a reason for all the terror...

17:43.609 --> 17:44.690
...and a way to end it?

17:46.609 --> 17:47.869
Maybe you are an angel.

17:49.009 --> 17:50.619
Can someone watch your daughter?

17:50.809 --> 17:52.910
- Yes. Why?
- The rest of you are coming with me.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.329
My assistants.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.970
I'm Cordelia.
Sorry about the possession.

18:14.690 --> 18:15.990
Uh.... Hello.

18:26.089 --> 18:27.630
Should I put plastic down?

18:27.890 --> 18:30.660
Are we expecting any vomiting?
I saw the movie.

18:36.890 --> 18:40.259
The powder will control
him while we find the priest.

18:41.089 --> 18:42.140
He doesn't need a priest.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.349
Paige.

18:47.089 --> 18:48.420
Listen to me.

18:48.890 --> 18:51.170
The only way through this
is to let us help.

18:52.490 --> 18:53.930
Your son is possessed.

18:54.890 --> 18:57.730
Deep down, you know
this is true. You know it.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.309
Cordelia will stay with you
until we return.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.890
Don't break the circle.
He'll ask you to come to him.

19:06.289 --> 19:09.619
Don't do it, don't touch him.
He's been exposed and he's angry.

19:10.490 --> 19:12.170
He'll kill you. You got that?

19:12.289 --> 19:15.910
Jeez, we got it! Circle, angry, kill.
Go to church already.

19:42.289 --> 19:44.250
Hail Mary, full of grace....

19:45.289 --> 19:46.480
Sister?

19:47.089 --> 19:49.859
Sorry to disturb you.
I hope you didn't lose your place.

19:51.289 --> 19:53.960
Not at all. How can I--?

19:56.690 --> 19:59.109
You would come in to
a place of worship?

20:00.890 --> 20:03.210
- I'm not what you think.
- No?

20:07.490 --> 20:09.950
Okay. Yeah, I am.

20:11.690 --> 20:14.500
But I'm trying to help a child
possessed by an Ethros demon.

20:15.289 --> 20:18.940
Which is why we need to find
Father Fredricks. It's rather urgent.

20:20.089 --> 20:21.420
He's behind the church.

20:21.890 --> 20:23.430
Thank you. Progress, at last.

20:24.289 --> 20:25.660
The last grave on the left.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.579
He's.... The father's dead?

20:33.289 --> 20:37.259
Six months ago, a family
came to Father Fredricks.

20:38.690 --> 20:40.970
Their daughter was
possessed with a demon.

20:42.289 --> 20:44.039
A very powerful demon.

20:45.890 --> 20:48.309
Father Fredricks
saved the young woman.

20:48.890 --> 20:50.609
But he couldn't save himself.

20:53.690 --> 20:54.990
It was an Ethros demon?

20:57.289 --> 21:00.059
If the child you are trying to save...

21:00.890 --> 21:05.069
...really is possessed with an Ethros,
my prayers are with you.

21:06.289 --> 21:07.160
Both of you.

21:07.490 --> 21:09.769
Because what you're dealing with...

21:10.490 --> 21:13.819
...is very, very smart
and very dangerous.

21:15.289 --> 21:17.150
Even more dangerous than you.

21:23.690 --> 21:25.369
Mommy? Where are you?

21:25.730 --> 21:26.569
Mommy, I'm scared.

21:28.730 --> 21:30.980
I need you. Are you there?

21:34.730 --> 21:37.640
Couldn't I just
take him his toys? Please?

21:38.930 --> 21:41.279
You heard what Angel said.
We have to wait.

21:41.329 --> 21:42.869
But why do we have to wait?

21:43.730 --> 21:46.049
Things were going
really well this time.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.920
Can't we just keep on like it was?

21:48.529 --> 21:51.339
Paige, no. Not after Ohio.

21:53.329 --> 21:54.490
Ohio?

21:57.529 --> 21:58.400
A friend of ours...

22:00.529 --> 22:03.089
...the kids called him Uncle Frank,
died in a fire.

22:05.930 --> 22:09.259
That was an accident. It wasn't Ryan.

22:10.130 --> 22:12.130
I'm scared, and it's so cold in here.

22:12.529 --> 22:13.609
Mommy?

22:14.930 --> 22:18.019
And that isn't Ryan, either. Paige?

22:18.529 --> 22:22.039
I'm not going to him, okay?
I'm playing by the stupid rules.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.420
Good, we can stay busy.
You'll get caught up...

22:26.930 --> 22:28.819
...won't even hear your son's pain.

22:29.930 --> 22:32.420
Mommy, I need you.
I'm so scared. Come here!

22:32.930 --> 22:34.440
This is just too cruel.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.740
It's almost over. Angel's good
at this kind of thing.

22:39.529 --> 22:40.650
And Wesley....

22:41.329 --> 22:43.539
They'll be right back with the priest.

22:50.930 --> 22:51.910
You can't do it.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.980
I know the ritual.
We have the supplies.

22:55.130 --> 22:56.990
You aren't ready.
It takes tremendous strength.

22:57.529 --> 23:00.789
- Mental strength.
- Resistance. I understand that.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.670
I possess a certain--

23:06.529 --> 23:08.920
You don't even have sales resistance.

23:09.529 --> 23:11.329
How many Thighmasters do you own?

23:11.329 --> 23:13.119
The second was free,
with Buns of Steel,

23:13.730 --> 23:16.329
The priest was an expert.
An Ethros killed him.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.400
- You're saying I can't do it.
- That's right.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.759
So our only option is,
you do it.

23:28.730 --> 23:30.869
- That was vulgar.
- But I made my point.

23:34.730 --> 23:36.799
All right. You'll do it.

23:37.730 --> 23:39.519
But I'll be right there with you.

23:52.730 --> 23:55.119
See, honey? Mommy's right here.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.240
I'm not going anywhere.

23:58.130 --> 24:01.180
Nobody's gonna hurt you,
sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

24:02.329 --> 24:03.589
Paige, come away.

24:05.329 --> 24:07.259
You wanted to see him. There he is.

24:07.730 --> 24:08.890
And he's gonna be fine.

24:09.529 --> 24:11.319
He's not fine. Look at him, Seth.

24:12.529 --> 24:15.089
Look at him. He needs me.

24:16.130 --> 24:17.569
Mama?

24:17.930 --> 24:19.119
Mom, I can't see.

24:19.730 --> 24:21.829
Something's wrong with
my eyes and it hurts.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.259
Why won't you help me?

24:26.329 --> 24:28.329
I'm here, baby. I'm right here.

24:33.529 --> 24:34.650
No, Paige!

24:37.130 --> 24:39.589
Latin is the ritual
of choice for an Ethros.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.250
Good. Come on.

24:43.730 --> 24:45.980
- What?
- I know how the priest was killed.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.859
When an Ethros is cast out, it
seeks another body to inhabit.

24:52.130 --> 24:55.609
The demon leaves so rapidly,
the inhabited rarely survives.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.279
- That's a problem.
- I dare say.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.539
Ryan!

25:06.529 --> 25:08.460
- They're here. They're coming.
- Mommy?

25:13.130 --> 25:13.900
No!

25:16.730 --> 25:17.779
Paige!

25:18.529 --> 25:19.579
Angel!

25:23.329 --> 25:25.079
Mommy, I'm so glad you're here.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.809
Paige, open the door.

25:27.529 --> 25:29.460
So glad....

25:39.250 --> 25:41.500
Ryan, no! Ryan, stop it!

25:43.450 --> 25:44.529
Angel!

25:45.849 --> 25:48.059
- Let go of your mother. Let go!
- Hurry!

25:48.849 --> 25:51.900
Listen to me, Ryan.
I said, stop it! Let her go!

26:04.450 --> 26:05.569
It's retreated.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.210
- It's gone deeper.
- That's likely.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.089
From now on, do exactly
as I tell you. Understood?

26:55.450 --> 26:56.710
Anything?

26:57.849 --> 27:00.450
Ethros demon, Ethros box.

27:02.049 --> 27:04.220
This is what's used to trap it.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.589
The demon goes dingy
when it's forced out.

27:07.450 --> 27:08.779
Bad sense of direction.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.069
With one of these,
it'll go right into it.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.369
"Confined for a thousand years."

27:13.450 --> 27:15.549
It should work,
but without one of these....

27:16.450 --> 27:19.400
It'll try to make the jump
to the nearest warm body.

27:20.049 --> 27:22.079
Right. So you're safe, anyway.

27:23.049 --> 27:25.079
Maybe we can build one of these.

27:27.250 --> 27:31.289
"An authentic Ethros box is made of
600 species of virgin woods...

27:32.049 --> 27:34.470
...and handcrafted
by blind Tibetan monks."

27:36.849 --> 27:38.529
Nope. Don't know any.

27:47.049 --> 27:49.440
Melrose and Robertson,
next to the yogurt shop.

27:50.049 --> 27:50.920
Blind virgin monks?

27:51.250 --> 27:54.130
No, Rick's Majick 'n Stuff.
He should have one.

27:56.650 --> 27:58.089
- Better hurry.
- Okay.

28:00.849 --> 28:01.619
What's happening?

28:12.410 --> 28:13.599
Your Latin sucks.

28:19.609 --> 28:20.869
I know your tricks.

28:22.009 --> 28:24.400
You can't deter me from
doing what must be done.

28:25.009 --> 28:26.380
You? Do something?

28:28.009 --> 28:29.450
You can't do anything.

28:40.609 --> 28:42.220
You couldn't even watch.

28:43.609 --> 28:44.660
Everybody knows you got fired.

28:45.410 --> 28:49.099
Nothing you do is right.
Nothing's gonna make him proud of you.

28:50.210 --> 28:53.440
Skimming the surface
of my mind. Very good.

28:54.410 --> 28:57.150
But a mere parlor trick.
Here's one for you.

28:58.009 --> 28:59.519
How many crosses am I holding?

29:02.210 --> 29:04.460
Mistreated for years
and still not good enough.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.460
Not good enough
for Daddy, or the Council.

29:13.609 --> 29:14.869
That is to say....

29:15.410 --> 29:18.920
Lose your place?
You think these people want you around?

29:19.609 --> 29:21.190
I invited him here.

29:22.609 --> 29:24.049
You're stupider than he is.

29:29.210 --> 29:31.309
Tell him why he's a fool to trust you.

29:34.609 --> 29:36.289
Tell him how you plan to kill him.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.369
- That's not true.
- He's afraid of you.

29:43.609 --> 29:44.730
I'll show you fear!

30:10.049 --> 30:11.099
Blessed be.

30:11.849 --> 30:12.930
Uh-huh.

30:13.049 --> 30:14.450
I need an Ethros box.

30:14.849 --> 30:16.500
A lady who knows what she wants.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.130
Yes. Just pop it in a bag
and I'm out of here.

30:20.849 --> 30:23.099
- I don't have one.
- You don't have one?

30:23.849 --> 30:26.480
Well, what's that?

30:29.849 --> 30:32.019
- That's a Shorshack box.
- What's the diff?

30:32.849 --> 30:35.549
About $20. It's not
available in a mahogany finish.

30:36.450 --> 30:37.680
Looks the same.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.650
Made by blind Tibetan monks?

30:40.049 --> 30:42.609
Made by mute Chinese nuns.
That's craftsmanship.

30:43.650 --> 30:46.109
I have an Ethros demon
and I need a box. Will this work?

30:46.650 --> 30:49.700
Probably. Shorshacks are
smaller than an Ethros.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.480
Might be a tight fit.

30:52.650 --> 30:56.019
How big could the demon be?
I mean, it's in a little-bitty boy.

30:56.849 --> 30:57.759
I'll take it.

30:58.049 --> 31:02.299
I think you'll enjoy this quality
item. Shall I have it gift-wrapped?

31:03.450 --> 31:04.500
That was too close.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.039
I let my guard down.
It won't happen again.

31:07.650 --> 31:10.950
You're not going back in there.
It could've killed you, Wesley.

31:11.849 --> 31:13.430
And my son? What about him?

31:29.849 --> 31:33.009
- Angel, we don't have a choice.
- The good fight, yeah?

31:40.049 --> 31:41.240
Guess who's here, Angel.

31:41.849 --> 31:43.289
He's talking to me right now.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.349
Doyle wants to ask
why you couldn't protect him.

31:51.450 --> 31:53.309
- What are you doing?
- Ending this.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.269
- So all they had was--
- Get it ready.

32:00.450 --> 32:03.119
You let him die. Just like
he's gonna let me die.

32:04.049 --> 32:04.779
Aren't you, Daddy?

32:08.250 --> 32:09.829
Two great protectors.

32:10.650 --> 32:11.910
Get back.

32:16.049 --> 32:17.700
Do you renounce Satan?

32:20.849 --> 32:22.150
And all his works?

32:24.450 --> 32:25.750
And all his pomps?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.930
Now get the hell out!

32:46.049 --> 32:46.990
Ryan?

32:58.049 --> 32:59.240
Uh-oh.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.200
Plakticine!

33:07.730 --> 33:10.150
Clearly, it came up the
elevator shaft.

33:11.329 --> 33:14.349
- So it's up here somewhere?
- No, it's long gone by now.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.119
And good riddance to it.

33:16.730 --> 33:17.809
No, it'll possess again.

33:18.529 --> 33:21.059
We shouldn't have
sent the Andersons home.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.359
It may repossess Ryan.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.609
I don't think so. Not right away.

33:25.730 --> 33:26.599
What are you thinking?

33:26.930 --> 33:29.559
It had to expel a lot of energy
to escape like this.

33:31.130 --> 33:32.460
It'll need time to recharge.

33:35.329 --> 33:37.539
You think it's
taken on corporeal form.

33:38.329 --> 33:41.349
It absorbs the elements it needs
by manifesting itself physically.

33:41.930 --> 33:44.839
Which means if we find it in time,
we can kill it.

33:45.529 --> 33:47.779
He needs a hostile
environment that's damp...

33:48.529 --> 33:51.480
...returning to primordial
volcanic basalt for regeneration.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.710
- Huh?
- Sea caves.

33:55.130 --> 33:56.500
Why didn't he just say that?

34:20.329 --> 34:21.909
We're close. Come on.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.610
Angel?

34:27.530 --> 34:30.268
Before we go any further,
I want to assure you...

34:30.530 --> 34:32.389
...since we'll
be fighting side by side....

34:35.329 --> 34:36.530
What the demon said before--

34:36.530 --> 34:38.949
I know you're not planning to kill me.

34:40.130 --> 34:42.659
But you're willing to.
And that's good.

34:43.130 --> 34:44.389
Now come on.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.250
- You.
- Did you think this was over?

35:14.929 --> 35:17.489
You are a fool.
You think to destroy me?

35:18.530 --> 35:20.559
These forces are
beyond your comprehension.

35:20.929 --> 35:22.650
Yeah, well, it's a hobby of mine.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.099
You great putrescent bully!

35:26.929 --> 35:29.559
Pick on a child?
You think you're impressive?

35:29.929 --> 35:33.829
I am Ethros! I corrupted men
before they had speech to name me.

35:37.130 --> 35:39.269
The child was but the last
among thousands.

35:39.530 --> 35:42.130
One more heart to corrupt.
One more soul to suck dry.

35:43.130 --> 35:47.409
Well, chalk up one exciting failure.
You didn't get that boy's soul.

35:47.929 --> 35:48.800
What soul?

35:57.530 --> 35:59.670
She has more marshmallows than I do.

36:00.530 --> 36:03.230
We'll have to write
the Nestlé Bunny about that.

36:03.530 --> 36:06.230
Drink up. It's way past bedtime.

36:07.130 --> 36:10.250
Do you know what the most
frightening thing in the world is?

36:11.329 --> 36:12.309
Nothing.

36:14.929 --> 36:16.119
That's what I found.

36:16.130 --> 36:20.449
No conscience, no fear, no humanity,
Just a void, I couldn't control him,

36:22.130 --> 36:24.969
I didn't manifest
until you brought me forth.

36:26.329 --> 36:29.519
I just sat and watched him
destroy everything around him.

36:29.929 --> 36:31.679
Not from evil or any other reason.

36:32.329 --> 36:35.239
- He doesn't seem to remember any of it.
- Good.

36:37.730 --> 36:40.260
That boy's mind
was the worst hell I've known.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.800
The marbles, that was you.

36:47.329 --> 36:49.079
When he slept, I could whisper in him.

36:50.329 --> 36:52.429
I tried to get him to end his life.

36:52.730 --> 36:54.480
You put him in front of the car.

36:56.329 --> 36:59.099
I had given up hope.

37:01.730 --> 37:03.309
I'm not afraid of death.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.090
The only thing I fear
is in that house.

37:06.530 --> 37:08.630
He's with his family.
We have to hurry.

37:09.530 --> 37:10.440
Yes, you do.

37:12.449 --> 37:14.030
Good night, sweetheart.

37:37.650 --> 37:38.699
Ryan?

37:44.849 --> 37:46.710
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

37:49.050 --> 37:50.449
- Open the door!
- Ryan!

37:50.849 --> 37:53.550
- Ryan, open the door!
- Ryan, sweetie!

37:55.650 --> 37:57.440
Ryan, open the door!

37:58.050 --> 37:59.309
Stephanie!

37:59.849 --> 38:01.599
Listen! Open the door!

38:03.449 --> 38:06.010
- Ryan, open this door!
- Ryan!

38:09.449 --> 38:12.780
Open this door! Open the door now!

38:17.250 --> 38:18.510
Open this door, now!

38:20.849 --> 38:22.710
- What are you doing out there?
- Stephanie!

38:23.250 --> 38:26.369
Ryan, open this door!
Do you hear me?!

38:53.250 --> 38:54.690
Stephanie!

38:57.449 --> 38:59.730
Ryan, open this door now!

39:02.849 --> 39:04.429
Mom, Dad, help!

39:10.050 --> 39:11.699
- Stephanie!
- Mom, Dad!

39:12.449 --> 39:15.929
- Stephanie!
- Stephanie! Stephanie!

39:22.050 --> 39:24.889
Everybody out! Go! Go! Go!

39:53.849 --> 39:57.469
Social Services will take over now.
They'll want to speak to your son.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.130
Can we see him?

39:59.849 --> 40:00.969
Not until tomorrow.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.159
- What'll happen to him?
- We'll know after the evaluation.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.829
Thanks for coming by, Kate.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.440
I won't be able to
cover for him anymore.

40:29.849 --> 40:32.659
They're gonna want to
know about Ohio...

40:33.449 --> 40:34.570
...and everything.

40:38.849 --> 40:40.250
I wanted to protect him.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.409
I know.

40:46.650 --> 40:49.179
I was just trying
to hold my family together.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.659
I think you did.
