WEBVTT

00:00.584 --> 00:04.762
Okay. Does your person talk
too much about his tax dollars?

00:04.797 --> 00:07.265
What? I... Aren't you supposed
to ask if they have a mustache

00:07.299 --> 00:09.277
- or something? I don't...
- Mustaches come and go.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.269
I'm trying to get at their soul, Andy.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.448
Like, would he say things like,
"My tax dollars paid for that?

00:13.472 --> 00:16.474
Oh, that's where my tax dollars
are going?" You know what I mean?

00:16.508 --> 00:19.110
I don't... How am I supposed to...

00:19.144 --> 00:21.619
Actually, yes. Wow. Yes, he would.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.314
- Yeah?
- Yeah! I can hear him saying it.

00:23.348 --> 00:26.451
I am narrowing in.
I know it's a man of at least 50.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.953
Alrighty.
I think we're all set for clothes.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.956
What else do we need? Teapot?
They'll have a teapot, won't they?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.958
Ah, you're all packed and ready to go?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.060
Is this your first vacation together?

00:36.095 --> 00:39.063
Oh, no, no! No, we went to Halifax once,

00:39.098 --> 00:42.667
to see the tall ships festival.
That was actually very fun.

00:42.701 --> 00:45.303
You know, you think
about ships being very long,

00:45.337 --> 00:47.305
but actually some are quite tall.

00:47.339 --> 00:50.742
Yeah. These were <i>too</i> tall.
But anyway, this is a different thing...

00:50.776 --> 00:55.246
This is, technically speaking,
a "wellness retreat".

00:55.280 --> 00:57.648
Doctor's orders.
We're going for Vitamin D,

00:57.683 --> 01:00.485
plus some Vitamin F,
"F" standing in this case

01:00.519 --> 01:02.487
- for fun!
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes!

01:02.521 --> 01:05.256
- That's good!
- That's a good one.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.959
Oh, actually, Dad,
I have an idea I want to run by you

01:07.993 --> 01:10.628
since I am going to be
running the museum...

01:10.662 --> 01:13.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.

01:13.132 --> 01:15.266
What makes you think you're
looking after the museum?

01:15.300 --> 01:19.403
I just assumed, because I'm the
eldest and most responsible.

01:19.438 --> 01:21.539
Well, I think you better think again,

01:21.573 --> 01:25.576
because this little chap
here is gonna be in charge.

01:25.611 --> 01:27.912
- Oh! Me?!
- Why is Mark in charge?

01:27.946 --> 01:30.548
- He's an idiot.
- OK. Well, If I'm such an idiot,

01:30.582 --> 01:33.417
then why have I been
preapproved for 2 credit cards?

01:33.452 --> 01:36.020
I know what I'm gonna get
from him, don't I?

01:36.054 --> 01:38.022
Hmm? He's gonna do the bare minimum,

01:38.056 --> 01:39.857
and then, when I get home,

01:39.892 --> 01:42.059
he's gonna come up
with a pathetic excuse.

01:42.094 --> 01:44.662
- He's predictable.
- Yes, I am.

01:44.696 --> 01:46.664
- Well said, Dad.
- Whereas you...

01:46.698 --> 01:50.034
I'm not even out the door and
you've already had an idea.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.637
I don't like ideas, Andrew.

01:52.671 --> 01:55.339
Ideas are dangerous.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.544
- Shall we?
- Hmm, yes!

01:59.578 --> 02:02.647
OK! Have fun, you two!
You've earned it. Heh.

02:02.681 --> 02:04.549
Alright,
I'm gonna finish you off right now.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.063
Would your guy call his mom "mother"?

02:06.970 --> 02:07.852
Yes.

02:07.886 --> 02:09.620
I knew it! You got Nick.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.897 --> 02:21.432
Yeah... I mean, it's... it's good, Bryn.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.768
It's just a little bit...
you know, anime.

02:23.802 --> 02:25.837
It's manga, not anime.

02:25.871 --> 02:28.439
Hey! Whoa, cool!

02:28.473 --> 02:31.943
Look at this. Smiling boy,
that must be me. Angry bald man,

02:31.977 --> 02:35.346
that's Andy. Right on! What's this for?

02:35.380 --> 02:37.415
I'm having Bryn design a
new poster for the museum.

02:37.449 --> 02:41.285
OK. So, remember
how less than two hours ago,

02:41.320 --> 02:43.454
Dad put me in charge because
he knew you'd freak out

02:43.488 --> 02:45.300
- and overdo it?
- I'm gonna change things up here.

02:45.324 --> 02:47.124
I got a bunch of ideas.
I mean, obviously,

02:47.159 --> 02:49.293
- that poster was a misstep, but...
- Wow. OK.

02:49.328 --> 02:51.272
Why would you waste your
time worrying about this?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.289
Let's go outside, have fun!
Go on a brother adventure, eh?

02:54.324 --> 02:55.476
What the hell is a "brother adventure"?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.401
It's brothers on an adventure!

02:57.436 --> 02:59.704
We go out there,
we meet some people, have some fun.

02:59.738 --> 03:01.539
Not sit around here,

03:01.573 --> 03:03.407
dwelling on how to fix up this museum,

03:03.442 --> 03:05.420
'cause Dad's just gonna
run it how he wants anyway.

03:05.444 --> 03:08.779
Dad runs the museum in a way
that nobody wants to come in.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.082
- Oh...
- Oh!

03:11.116 --> 03:14.652
- Sorry. Are you open?
- Yes we are!

03:14.686 --> 03:16.554
Welcome to the Museum of the Strange

03:16.588 --> 03:18.228
and Fantastic.
Please, have a look around.

03:18.257 --> 03:22.093
I can offer you a small
tour if you'd like.

03:22.127 --> 03:25.263
Here we have some dinosaur eggs,
more or less;

03:25.297 --> 03:27.751
here we have a little skull.

03:28.634 --> 03:31.135
Here's a conch shell.
You know how people mispronounce that,

03:31.169 --> 03:34.739
but it's "conk".
Hm, I think that's a spine.

03:34.773 --> 03:36.484
Oh, there's the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my life

03:36.508 --> 03:38.676
if you're in the market
for true nightmare.

03:39.502 --> 03:42.179
- Mom, it bit me!
- Oh!

03:42.214 --> 03:44.749
Sh...! OK, well,
I see your daughter has met

03:44.783 --> 03:47.151
- our famous caged squirrel...
- We're leaving.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.287
Well, thank you so much for coming!
Sorry about that!

03:49.321 --> 03:51.188
Have a strange and fantastic day.

03:51.223 --> 03:53.201
"Have a strange and fantastic day."
Nice one, Bryn!

03:53.225 --> 03:55.860
Well, well, well, well, well, Andy.
I think you'll find

03:55.894 --> 03:57.862
that those were, technically, customers.

03:57.896 --> 04:00.596
OK! I am gonna go make
some changes around here.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.076
What are you talking about?
Where are you going? Andy!

04:02.100 --> 04:04.646
I'm in charge here! Don't...
Alright, I gotta go after him. Bryn,

04:04.670 --> 04:07.271
- watch the place while I'm gone.
- Roger that.

04:07.306 --> 04:09.217
But don't kiss and hug the
squirrel while I'm out, OK?

04:09.241 --> 04:12.076
- Hm-mmm.
- OK.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.578
You know what? It's your life,
live your life. I don't care.

04:14.613 --> 04:15.721
Andy!

04:19.250 --> 04:21.228
Andy, what are we doing here, man?
What is this place?

04:21.253 --> 04:23.231
It's the Cavendish flea market.
It's where I was gonna

04:23.255 --> 04:25.222
- sell Dad's stuff when he died.
- Jesus...

04:25.257 --> 04:27.224
I bet we can find some
pretty cool things in here.

04:27.259 --> 04:29.794
No, let's not do this.
Let's go have fun. Come on!

04:29.828 --> 04:32.897
But this <i>is</i> fun! This is like the
brother thing you were talking about.

04:32.931 --> 04:34.966
- A brother adventure?
- Yes! A brother adventure.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.278
- How is this a brother adventure?
- Come on! Me coming up

04:37.302 --> 04:40.504
with a new exhibit; you help me out.
Both of us scheming behind dad's back...?

04:40.539 --> 04:42.673
- I do like to scheme...
- You like to scheme!

04:42.708 --> 04:44.675
- OK. What are we looking for?
- Alright!

04:44.710 --> 04:47.111
What's, like... What are we...
What's the thing?

04:47.145 --> 04:51.682
Basically, I'm looking for
something that's family friendly.

04:51.717 --> 04:53.651
Need help for myself and...

04:53.685 --> 04:56.821
- Oh, my God. That's Molly.
- Where? Oh, hey, Molly!

04:56.855 --> 04:59.190
- Don't talk... don't wave!
- Mark and Andy!

04:59.224 --> 05:01.058
- Don't talk to...
- Come on!

05:01.448 --> 05:04.933
Hey! How's it going? Mark, Andy.

05:04.968 --> 05:07.231
Not sure if you remember us.
Andy had a crush on you

05:07.265 --> 05:09.277
in third grade.
And then I think the last time we saw

05:09.301 --> 05:11.502
- each other was when Andy...
- Stabbed my son.

05:11.536 --> 05:13.971
- That's it! That was it. Hm.
- Yeah...

05:14.006 --> 05:16.874
Hey, Jacob!
How are you holdin' up, little buddy?

05:16.908 --> 05:19.510
Hmm! Holy sh...! Wow.

05:19.544 --> 05:22.913
OK. Picture's worth a
thousand words there, huh?

05:22.948 --> 05:25.116
Yeah. It's... Hm.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.795
- So, what are you selling here?
- It's an organic health smoothie made

05:27.819 --> 05:30.121
- from the products in my garden.
- Oh, sweet, sweet.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.699
We're hoping to get it on
grocery store shelves soon.

05:31.723 --> 05:35.259
- Do you mind if I try a sample?
- That's why they're there.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.628
Hm, alright. Here we go!

05:41.433 --> 05:43.401
That's actually really good.

05:43.435 --> 05:45.403
- Is that good?
- Mmm. Yeah! What's in it?

05:45.437 --> 05:48.773
It's an organic health smoothie
made from the products in my garden.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.608
You already said that. Yeah.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.453
I don't think there's any
need to be more specific.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.980
Well, I think we would love
to take a bunch of these.

05:56.014 --> 05:58.949
Um, how many would say,

05:58.984 --> 06:01.986
"I am so, so sorry
for stabbing your son"?

06:02.020 --> 06:05.056
Well, now we know how much
it costs to stab a little boy.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.058
Can we just find an exhibit please...

06:07.092 --> 06:09.660
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What about these? These look good.

06:09.694 --> 06:12.029
They look like they're
in pretty rough shape...

06:12.064 --> 06:15.099
No way! Look. This one looks amazing.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.835
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- Can I help you?

06:17.869 --> 06:20.805
She's a lady!
She's-she's not wax, she's a lady.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.407
Thank you!
Are we looking for anything specific?

06:23.442 --> 06:25.643
Uh, no. I don't think so.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.978
Just sort of browsing.
Did you make all these yourself?

06:28.013 --> 06:31.315
No, my husband.
He collected them, one a year

06:31.349 --> 06:33.327
until his death.
Would you care to hear how he died?

06:33.351 --> 06:35.453
I think I've found something.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.455
Fred Penner!

06:37.489 --> 06:40.758
Oh, yeah!
Look at that, it's Fred Penner.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.860
I never knew what that was.

06:42.894 --> 06:45.417
- Who did you say that is?
- Oh, it's Fred Penner.

06:45.452 --> 06:46.931
He had a kids' show on CBC.

06:46.965 --> 06:49.133
Sang <i>The Cat Came Back.</i>
You know that one?

06:49.167 --> 06:52.269
Recently was awarded
the Order of Canada.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.839
Wait, why do I know
so much about Fred Penner?

06:54.873 --> 06:58.042
Maybe because he inspired an
entire generation of Canadians?

06:58.076 --> 07:00.878
Honestly, he was more of a
father to me than Dad was.

07:00.912 --> 07:03.948
He taught wholesome life lessons;
he was fun...

07:05.093 --> 07:07.384
and he was a pretty snappy dresser.

07:08.552 --> 07:09.552
You know what?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.239
We'll take it.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.575
♪ You've got to be proud
of the people around you ♪

07:23.609 --> 07:26.444
♪ Proud of the things that you do ♪

07:26.479 --> 07:28.446
♪ Proud of your dreams ♪

07:28.481 --> 07:30.382
♪ And feelings inside And never... ♪

07:30.416 --> 07:33.118
Andy, what the hell is this, man?

07:33.152 --> 07:34.472
Morning, Mark! What do you think?

07:34.581 --> 07:37.622
I think Dad is gonna be furious

07:37.657 --> 07:39.457
'cause this is a whole different place.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.961
Exactly. It's the place where
families can have fun <i>and</i> learn.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.164
And it centres around
a great Canadian icon.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.999
He means Fred Penner. The statue.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.202
Yeah, I sorta pieced that
together on my own,

07:50.236 --> 07:53.205
but thank you, Bryn.
Andy, where is Dad's stuff?

07:53.239 --> 07:55.207
Where's the sarcophagus?
Where's the squirrel?!

07:55.241 --> 07:57.642
The stuff is in storage.
And as for the squirrel... Bryn?

07:57.677 --> 07:59.517
- The squirrel is safe.
- The squirrel is safe.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.313
It's incredible, right? Oh, yeah!

08:01.347 --> 08:03.559
Bryn even made some new flyers.
Show him the flyers, Bryn.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.218
"Come get a Fred-ucation"? Alright.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.121
Did you do somehow pull
all of this off in one night?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.989
It's like something
was calling to me, saying,

08:11.023 --> 08:13.391
"You've gotta finish this.
Finish this exhibit".

08:13.426 --> 08:16.872
Right? Oh, and the Fred tribute,
that's just the beginning.

08:16.896 --> 08:20.365
I'm gonna redo this entire floor. Yeah.
Interactive exhibits, family fun.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.487
- Welcome to the fun zone, Mark!
- "The fun zone"?

08:23.570 --> 08:26.037
That's what I'm gonna call it.
Hey, did you know that

08:26.072 --> 08:28.640
- Velcro was invented in Canada?
- I didn't know that.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.670
- Fred-ucational.
- Doesn't apply here, Bryn.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.087
I'm also gonna get rid of that stupid
UFO and put it in a ball pit.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.794
OK, well, kids like UFOs, Andy,

08:34.813 --> 08:37.293
if that's what you are after.
And you can't just fill

08:37.350 --> 08:39.650
a dirt hole with balls
and call it a ball pit.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.419
Sure, you can. Get your balls,
get your pit. That's a ball pit.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.633
- That's not...
- Fred-u-tainmment.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.326
Holy hell, Bryn, if it's not a Fred-related
thing, you can't use a Fred pun.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.694
Now, I know I'm mad at Andy
and I'm sorta

08:49.729 --> 08:52.364
taking it out on you, but I got...
I gotta know that

08:52.398 --> 08:54.332
- that's clear.
- Don't listen to him, Bryn.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.270
You gotta listen to the
wise words of Fred Penner:

08:58.304 --> 09:01.573
"You've got to be proud of the people
around you. Proud of the things that you do

09:01.607 --> 09:04.042
"Proud of your dreams
and feelings inside

09:04.076 --> 09:07.312
"And never afraid to let
them shine through. No-o.

09:07.346 --> 09:10.715
Never afraid to make them come true."

09:10.750 --> 09:13.485
Sure. I understand that

09:13.519 --> 09:16.021
this exhibit and Fred Penner
mean a lot to you...

09:16.055 --> 09:18.557
Exactly. Great! Just put these on,
we're gonne hand out flyers.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.736
What? No, man! I don't car...
I don't even have my shoes!

09:20.760 --> 09:21.882
We'll get some shoes on the way.
Let's go!

09:21.895 --> 09:25.030
- Stop pushing me, man!
- Have Fred out there.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.998
Come to the Museum of
the Strange and Fantastic

09:27.033 --> 09:29.501
and see our new exhibit,
starring Fred Penner himself!

09:29.535 --> 09:31.670
Just kidding, he's a statue.
Can you imagine if I had

09:31.704 --> 09:33.805
the actual Fred Penner in the museum?
You'd be like,

09:33.839 --> 09:35.584
"Let him go!"
And I'd be like, "No, he's mine!"

09:35.608 --> 09:39.077
Hey, come on down to The Museum
of the Strange and Fantastic.

09:39.111 --> 09:42.013
We got a Fred Penner exhibit.
It's Fred-ucational.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.816
Is this guy bothering you?
Ha-ah! Just kidding.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.628
Come to the museum!
Don't make me follow you home!

09:46.652 --> 09:48.630
- I will follow you home.
- Not gonna follow you home.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.732
I'll follow you home if you don't come!
And drag you to the museum.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.801
He's certainly not going to do that.
That's actually illegal,

09:52.825 --> 09:54.793
to say stuff like that, man.
Take it easy.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.761
It's the A to Ms of business, Mark.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.763
The "A to Ms" of business?

09:58.798 --> 10:00.098
- Yes!
- What the hell is that?

10:00.132 --> 10:02.534
"Always Be Calling Dem Everyones

10:02.568 --> 10:04.970
For Going I Just Know that's Museum."

10:05.004 --> 10:08.106
That was impressive.
That was weirdly impressive.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.508
Yeah, I am locked in, man.
I feel like a whole new person.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.721
Right? I feel... I feel like I
have a purpose, and that purpose

10:12.745 --> 10:14.713
is to make this exhibit great.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.115
So, let's head down to the pier.
I bet there's

10:17.149 --> 10:19.951
- lot of great foot traffic.
- No, no. No, no, no. Alright?

10:19.986 --> 10:22.187
We've been doing this for
too long and we're both

10:22.221 --> 10:25.190
a little bit tired, so let's...
let's take a break. OK, buddy?

10:25.224 --> 10:27.264
You'll take a break when
I say you can take a break.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.362
I don't know what the hell
is going on with you today,

10:30.396 --> 10:32.497
but you are acting insane.

10:32.531 --> 10:33.911
It's called decisiveness, Mark.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.369
- All great captains have it.
- "Captains"?

10:36.403 --> 10:39.371
Yes. I wasn't sure what I
was gonna do last night,

10:39.405 --> 10:43.475
but then I stared into that statue's
eyes and, 5 hours later, I had it.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.821
I'm sorry, you stared at that
statue for 5 hours last night?

10:45.845 --> 10:47.445
- Yeah.
- F-five hours?!

10:47.480 --> 10:49.157
- Five or six, yeah, sure.
- Five or six hours...

10:49.181 --> 10:50.726
No, no. We're taking a break.
Gimme these.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.518
You know what? Fine. Take a break, Mark.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.409
I can do this brother
adventure on my own.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.922
And like Fred Penner says:

10:57.957 --> 10:59.824
"I'll do it my way".

10:59.859 --> 11:02.360
- It's a Frank Sinatra song.
- Fred did a cover!

11:05.731 --> 11:09.334
♪ He don't love you like I do ♪

11:12.505 --> 11:14.372
What can I get you, hon?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.207
- Uh, just a beer, please.
- Sure.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.681
Thank you.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.214
OK. Thank you!

11:23.249 --> 11:25.350
Hey, I recognize you, right?
You were at the...

11:25.384 --> 11:27.986
in the posse that helped
us hunt for the beast?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.088
You had the pitchfork, didn't you?

11:30.122 --> 11:33.325
- Right.
- Oh, you've still got it. Yes.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.170
I got it on spec
from my cousin in Nova Scotia,

11:35.194 --> 11:37.595
traded me for six alternators.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.931
Pretty fine deal when you break it down.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.068
OK. Cool.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.237
- Where's your brother at, man?
- My brother? Oh.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.239
He's probably still handing out flyers

11:48.274 --> 11:51.242
for a stupid museum exhibit.
He's just obsessed

11:51.277 --> 11:53.712
with proving himself to my Dad.
You know what I mean?

11:53.746 --> 11:56.214
- Mm-hmm.
- Just once, I wish I had a brother

11:56.248 --> 11:58.550
who knew how to kick back
and have fun for a change.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.419
Oh. I always... a brother.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.456
We could kick it around,
give 'er a test run, give it a shot.

12:07.326 --> 12:11.196
Sir, are you offering to be my brother?

12:11.230 --> 12:14.142
- Is that what you are offering?
- You got something in your ears there, bud?

12:14.166 --> 12:17.202
No. OK! That's...
Yeah, I heard you clearly, I guess.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.537
Somehow. Uh...

12:20.457 --> 12:21.973
Hell yeah! I mean...

12:22.007 --> 12:24.309
It's a strange offer, but I'll take it.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.778
- Alright.
- Let's be brothers for a day!

12:26.812 --> 12:28.580
Sounds alright, man.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.425
Yeah. What do you want our
first brother adventure to be?

12:30.449 --> 12:33.051
Do a little cab hash.
We'll go down to the mall, the pet shop.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.953
Free 'em up. <i>Jumanji</i> in the food court.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.432
OK. Well, let's start with beer

12:38.558 --> 12:40.536
and then sorta see where it
goes from there. One more beer

12:40.560 --> 12:43.795
- for my brother, please!
- Drink on this.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.169
He says to me, "No, I never!
I wouldn't have it!"

12:51.203 --> 12:54.005
They got the names of
the Renaissance painters!

12:54.039 --> 12:56.975
"So don't put it up!
I'll play the pig, you play the mother."

12:57.009 --> 13:01.513
They're ninjas.
To cap it all out, turtles.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.715
- He'll come for it.
- Oh, I see four of these

13:03.749 --> 13:05.884
little... little guys coming.
I'm like, alright there,

13:05.918 --> 13:08.330
'cause I didn't even know his name.
Next thing you know, my pants are gone!

13:08.354 --> 13:11.322
Little buddy's scurrying around.
I set a little trap, a little FBI trap.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.726
And then in the morning,
five, six, seven guys come,

13:14.760 --> 13:16.895
frees him up, scurry him
down the street. I said,

13:16.929 --> 13:18.874
"Come back, you're wearing my pants!
The only pants I got left!"

13:18.898 --> 13:21.433
Yeah. Yeah, that'll... Alright.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.268
That's why I won't vote for him.
Never again.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.671
Amen to most of that. Can we get
maybe another couple of beers here?

13:26.705 --> 13:28.773
- You good? Ready for more?
- Oh, yeah.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.042
Another couple of those? Ah...

13:31.076 --> 13:34.212
Oh, check that out.
It's Andy's stupid flyer.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.315
What do I got left here?

13:43.422 --> 13:46.357
Buddy, what you got here is
a fine picture of The Cruel.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.060
You're talking about Fred Penner?

13:49.094 --> 13:51.129
That's not Fred Penner.

13:51.163 --> 13:55.600
That's Christopher The Cruel, the most
feared pirate in all of Cavendish history.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.462
Legend has it, when he was
being hanged for his crimes

13:58.497 --> 14:04.843
he vowed to return and exact revenge
on all future generations.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.911
Where did you get this image?

14:06.946 --> 14:10.181
Uh, well, it's a photo of
a statue that my brother's

14:10.216 --> 14:14.152
been staring at for hours at a
time while he slowly goes mad.

14:14.894 --> 14:16.811
Do we think that's an issue?

14:18.023 --> 14:21.092
Yes, we do. That's the "yes, we do" look

14:21.126 --> 14:24.929
from both of you. Alright. Alright...

14:28.734 --> 14:31.670
OK, there it is.
Thanks again for doing this, Felix.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.682
Oh, I like a brother adventure
as much as the next fellow

14:33.706 --> 14:37.108
- when you get down to it.
- Hell yeah, buddy.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.043
You grab that side, I'll grab this side.

14:39.855 --> 14:41.546
He's too damn heavy!

14:41.580 --> 14:44.883
- It's heavy as hell.
- What are you doing, Mark?

14:44.917 --> 14:47.552
Oh, my gosh! Oh! Andy.

14:47.586 --> 14:51.189
- What are <i>you</i> doing?
- Oh, just some light swabbing.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.358
You mean mopping?

14:54.084 --> 14:56.361
Yeah...

14:56.395 --> 14:59.397
Well, we were just gonna go
clean this thing out back,

14:59.431 --> 15:01.533
Felix has some good
cleaning agents, so...

15:01.567 --> 15:03.879
- if you don't mind, we're just...
- I can't let you do that, Mark.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.938
Geez! Andy, listen, man.
This isn't Fred Penner.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.207
It's some evil pirate from the past

15:09.241 --> 15:11.209
- whose name I can't remember...
- The Cruel.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.379
The Cruel! It's The Cruel.
And he's... Well, take a look, OK?

15:14.413 --> 15:17.815
Down here. That's a normal leg. Peg leg!

15:17.850 --> 15:19.817
Peg leg, Andy!
I'm pretty sure Fred Penner

15:19.852 --> 15:21.830
didn't have a peg leg.
Not a 100% sure, but pretty sure.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.422
- Let it go!
- OK. OK, buddy.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.524
Listen, I'm just trying
to help you, alright?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.303
I'm not saying you're
possessed by this statue,

15:28.327 --> 15:32.196
but you are demonstrating a lot
of possessed-like qualities.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.943
So why don't we just play
it safe and do the exhibit

15:33.967 --> 15:37.969
- without the statue?
- You don't want me to succeed.

15:38.003 --> 15:41.239
You want me to live below the decks.

15:42.336 --> 15:44.042
But I have news for you...

15:44.076 --> 15:47.845
I was born for so much

15:47.880 --> 15:50.648
more...

15:51.896 --> 15:54.419
Don't do that, please.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.821
Listen, Andy. I...

15:56.855 --> 16:01.259
want you to have everything you want.

16:03.195 --> 16:04.996
But the way you're saying
what you're saying

16:05.030 --> 16:07.799
sound so possessed!

16:07.833 --> 16:09.801
Anyway, I'm getting rid
of this thing. OK!

16:09.835 --> 16:12.170
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Let go of it, buddy. Let go!

16:12.204 --> 16:14.472
No, he's staying here!
He stays! No, no, no! He stays!

16:14.506 --> 16:16.426
Let go. Let go. Let go, Andy.
Felix, help me out!

16:20.894 --> 16:22.080
Felix?

16:30.157 --> 16:31.189
He's dead.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.527
One sec, let me see...

16:36.562 --> 16:38.696
I'm not actually sure...

16:38.731 --> 16:41.199
How do you...
Where's the pulse, exactly?

16:47.189 --> 16:50.725
<i>Andy, we killed someone, man.
We got to go to the police!</i>

16:50.760 --> 16:53.662
Not until we open the exhibit.
When it's successful,

16:53.696 --> 16:56.398
and Dad sees I'm right,
then we go to the police.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.500
Are you kidding me?
Listen to yourself, Andy.

16:58.534 --> 17:00.468
No matter how successful
your exhibit is,

17:00.503 --> 17:02.637
Dad will never admit you're right!

17:02.672 --> 17:06.441
Oh, but he'll have to, Mark!
It will be undeniable.

17:06.474 --> 17:09.978
Then I will be running the museum, and
you will be the one digging the graves.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.946
Nobody should be digging
graves at a museum!

17:12.982 --> 17:15.884
Hey, guys?
Have you seen the rice cooker?

17:15.917 --> 17:19.921
- Uh... no?
- OK.

17:19.954 --> 17:23.458
- I really need to make rice.
- Why?

17:23.492 --> 17:25.627
I like the way the squirrel eats it.

17:25.661 --> 17:28.296
OK, don't feed that squirrel rice, Bryn.

17:28.330 --> 17:31.066
I'm gonna feed the squirrel.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.401
Do you think she saw the body?

17:33.971 --> 17:37.272
I don't know. If she did,
I don't think she cared...?

17:38.500 --> 17:39.500
We gotta hide it.

17:40.410 --> 17:42.777
We gotta... Where's the body?!

17:42.812 --> 17:45.080
- What?
- Where's the body, Mark?!

17:45.425 --> 17:46.973
Felix! You're alive!

17:47.350 --> 17:48.596
What are you doing, man?
I'm...

17:52.967 --> 17:54.155
Felix!

17:54.190 --> 17:57.492
- Come back here!
- Run, Felix! He'll kill you!

17:57.526 --> 17:59.494
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU, FELIX!

18:12.842 --> 18:15.377
Get back here! Oh!
Going through the log, eh?

18:20.583 --> 18:23.118
Stay down. Goodnight, ye scurvy dog!

18:23.152 --> 18:25.320
Andy, wait! No! Don't do this!

18:25.354 --> 18:27.394
Just drop the shovel man!
This isn't you! This is...

18:28.512 --> 18:30.001
God damn it, what's that pirate's name?

18:30.025 --> 18:32.394
- The Cruel.
- The Cruel! It's Christopher the Cruel!

18:32.428 --> 18:34.406
It's not you. You've always been
delusional but not like this!

18:34.430 --> 18:36.831
Felix is an anchor, weighing me down!

18:36.866 --> 18:38.833
I've got to unmoor him from my ship.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.835
Wait, Andy! What...

18:40.870 --> 18:42.837
What would Fred Penner say?

18:54.617 --> 18:56.684
Oh, hi, Andy.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.653
Hi, Fred.

18:58.687 --> 19:01.322
Thanks for listening and
watching all these years.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.358
You know, there's always been

19:03.392 --> 19:05.927
a common message I've
tried to share with you:

19:06.285 --> 19:09.864
Take good care of each other.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.200
So I shouldn't murder
this guy with my shovel?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.269
What? No.

19:14.303 --> 19:17.372
OK. Hey, Fred?

19:18.571 --> 19:20.175
Did that cat ever come back?

19:21.198 --> 19:23.211
The very next day.

19:24.976 --> 19:26.047
Bye, Fred.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.649
Bye.

19:29.493 --> 19:31.719
Oh, Mark. I'm sorry,
you're right. Fred Penner

19:31.754 --> 19:34.422
would never do this.
I guess I let my obsession

19:34.457 --> 19:36.724
with impressing Dad cloud my judg...

19:37.310 --> 19:39.894
Oh, what the hell, Felix?!

19:39.929 --> 19:41.896
He was having a change of heart!

19:47.507 --> 19:48.303
Oh!

19:48.395 --> 19:52.290
There he is. My sunshine boy.
How you feeling?

19:52.325 --> 19:53.975
- My head hurts.
- There's actually

19:54.009 --> 19:56.085
two reasons for that.
One is a stone to the noggin,

19:56.112 --> 19:59.147
courtesy of Felix over there.
And number two is, well,

19:59.181 --> 20:01.569
- a lot of poison there, fellas.
- Poison?

20:01.584 --> 20:03.745
We ran some tests and
discovered that you consumed

20:03.753 --> 20:06.855
lethal levels of, well,
organic amphetamines.

20:06.889 --> 20:09.791
Or, as we like to call it,
nature's meth.

20:09.825 --> 20:12.293
- Molly's smoothies.
- How many of those did you drink, man?

20:12.328 --> 20:15.497
- I don't know. Half?
- Half what? Half a crate?

20:15.531 --> 20:17.565
Or two thirds?
I mean, they were really good.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.134
They are really good.
Oh, actually, you know what,

20:20.169 --> 20:22.804
I should probably get out of here.
There's a game

20:22.838 --> 20:24.816
on my phone I wanna finish playing.
Good chat, guys.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.808
OK. You know,
I'm still not 100% convinced

20:26.842 --> 20:28.743
it was just those health shakes,

20:28.777 --> 20:31.846
unless "nature's meth"
makes you talk like a pirate.

20:31.881 --> 20:33.982
- Pirate?
- Oh, nothing. I'll explain later.

20:34.016 --> 20:37.211
Come on, let's get home. I wanna get rid
of that statue. See you later, Felix!

20:37.287 --> 20:39.975
If you were my actual brother,
I'd go back in time, find father

20:39.989 --> 20:42.557
- and lance his balls clean off.
- Are we allowed to leave this?

20:42.591 --> 20:44.469
Yeah, yeah. You got your slippers.
We'll get your clothes

20:44.493 --> 20:46.019
on the way out. Bye, buddy.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.544
That'll be my rice.
