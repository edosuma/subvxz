28:30.042 --> 28:31.577
Justin: THE EVIDENCE IS SO TINY,
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT

28:31.577 --> 28:33.112
IF YOU HELD IT
IN YOUR HAND.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.847
A FEW COMMON YELLOW
CARPET FIBERS,

28:34.847 --> 28:37.183
SOME RED CARPET FIBERS
AND SOME HAIR.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.650
THAT'S IT.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.854
THE FIBERS WILL BE SUBJECTED
TO INFRARED SPECTROPHOTOMETRY

28:41.854 --> 28:44.156
TO DETERMINE THEIR GENERIC
AND SUB-GENERIC CLASSES,

28:44.156 --> 28:45.792
THEN COMPARED AGAINST
THE DATABASE

28:45.792 --> 28:47.126
TO DETERMINE
THE MANUFACTURER,

28:47.126 --> 28:48.394
BUT THAT WON'T BE MUCH HELP.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.229
YELLOW CARPET FIBERS,
CONSISTENT WITH

28:50.229 --> 28:52.431
A MASS-PRODUCED LINE
OF THE TRIACETATE VARIETY.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.600
MANUFACTURED OUT OF DENVER,
DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER

28:54.600 --> 28:55.734
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES

28:55.734 --> 28:58.070
UNDER SEVERAL DIFFERENT
BRAND NAMES.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.038
NO HELP.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.007
SAME WITH
THE RED FIBERS.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.642
SEVERAL LUSTROUS
TRILOBAL NYLON FIBERS

29:03.642 --> 29:07.046
ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER
RED DELUSTERED FIBERS

29:07.046 --> 29:08.680
WILL BE EXAMINED
AND MATCHED WITH THE BRANDS.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.116
SOLD BY HANOVER SAMPSON

29:10.116 --> 29:13.052
FOR SEVERAL WHOLESALE
DISCOUNT STORES.

29:13.052 --> 29:13.853
OH.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.922
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

29:15.922 --> 29:19.191
THEY SOLD 50,000 OF THEM
IN THAT COLOR LAST YEAR.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.728
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION
OF THE CUTICLE, THE CORTEX,

29:22.728 --> 29:23.963
AND THE MEDULLA
OF THE HAIR

29:23.963 --> 29:26.065
WILL REVEAL THEM
TO BE HUMAN IN ORIGIN.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.266
2 BROWN HUMAN HEAD HAIRS.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.802
DEFINITELY NOT
THE VICTIM'S.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.804
Justin: ALL BUT ONE.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.311
THIS ONE
WILL BAFFLE THEM,

29:39.311 --> 29:41.047
BUT IT WILL ALL
MAKE SENSE LATER.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.849
ONE HAIR
OF NONHUMAN ORIGIN.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.150
SCALE PATTERN OF THE HAIR
MATCHES THAT

29:44.150 --> 29:46.052
OF CYNOCEPHALUS MAIMON.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.956
IT'S A FREAKIN'
BABOON HAIR.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.892
NO FINGERPRINTS,
NO MURDER WEAPON.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.994
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR WORK
CUT OUT FOR THEM.

29:56.762 --> 29:59.365
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
PAID FOR, RIGHT?

29:59.365 --> 30:00.299
Sam: HERE IT IS.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.101
CORONER SAID
STRANGULATION WAS SLOW,

30:02.101 --> 30:05.004
PERHAPS THE VICTIM
WAS BEING TORTURED.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.839
UM, THAT THE POSTMORTEM
STAB WOUNDS

30:06.839 --> 30:08.074
BARELY BROKE
THE SURFACE.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.808
THEY WERE TENTATIVE.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.186
OK, THAT'S IT.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.520
ONCE THEY PUT IT
ALL TOGETHER,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.789
THEY'LL DECIDE THAT,
GIVEN THE SLOPPY NATURE

30:23.789 --> 30:24.924
OF THE CRIME SCENE--

30:24.924 --> 30:26.859
THE POSTMORTEM
MUTILATION--

30:26.859 --> 30:28.627
THE PROFILE WILL LEAN
TOWARDS THAT

30:28.627 --> 30:30.729
OF A DISORGANIZED
OFFENDER.

30:30.729 --> 30:31.931
POOR SOCIAL SKILLS.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.600
Justin:
NOCTURNAL BY NATURE.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.136
PROBABLY
INTO PORNOGRAPHY.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.005
Justin: ABOVE AVERAGE
INTELLIGENCE, BUT UNEDUCATED.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.172
LIVES ALONE.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.673
LIMITED RELATIONS
WITH WOMEN.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.244
ATTACK WAS SPONTANEOUS.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.179
UNPLANNED.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.680
EXCEPT, HE DIDN'T
DRIVE DOWN CLOSE

30:48.680 --> 30:50.649
TO THE DUMP SPOT.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.919
THAT IS PLANNING.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.621
BUT HE LEFT
THE FOOTPRINTS.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.157
NONE OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
WILL LEAD TO THE SUSPECT,

30:58.157 --> 31:00.326
BUT THEY WILL DAMN HIM
WHEN HE IS DISCOVERED.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.461
WHEN WILL THEY
HAVE A SUSPECT?

31:02.461 --> 31:03.930
THEY SHOULD BE
EATING OUT OF OUR HANDS

31:03.930 --> 31:05.197
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.833
Richard: POOR RAY.
HE'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.535
CASSIE,
LOOK AT THIS.

31:12.638 --> 31:13.805
"VIGI BOOTS."

31:13.805 --> 31:16.075
WHAT THE HELL
ARE VIGI BOOTS?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.779
THERE HE IS,
IN THE BLACK COAT.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.581
DON'T LET HIM
CHARM YOU TOO MUCH.

31:23.682 --> 31:24.883
RICHARD HAYWOOD?

31:28.354 --> 31:29.555
CASSIE MAYWEATHER,
SAM KENNEDY.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.422
SAN BENITO POLICE.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.791
CAN WE TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

31:32.791 --> 31:34.160
YEAH, SURE.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.265
SO, YOU'RE WILLING
TO SPEAK TO US

31:39.265 --> 31:41.700
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY
PRESENT?

31:41.700 --> 31:42.901
SURE.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.438
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST THURSDAY NIGHT?

31:49.641 --> 31:51.910
YOU THINK YOU COULD
TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.445
WE'LL GET TO THAT.
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

31:53.445 --> 31:57.183
I WAS CRAMMING FOR THIS
CALCULUS MID-TERM.

31:57.183 --> 31:58.717
I WAS WITH
A STUDY GROUP.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.952
HOW LONG?

31:59.952 --> 32:03.722
FROM ABOUT 7:00
UNTIL 3:00 FRIDAY MORNING.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.724
THAT'S QUITE
A CRAM SESSION.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.960
YEAH, WELL...

32:07.960 --> 32:09.428
YOU KNOW, I GOT
KIND OF A SPOTTY RECORD.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.431
I GOT TO KEEP MY GRADES UP
FOR COLLEGE.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.706
CAN YOU GIVE US THE NAMES
OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE?

32:20.706 --> 32:23.275
YEAH. SURE.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.943
AM I IN SOME KIND
OF TROUBLE?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.412
YOU SEEM VERY PARTICULAR

32:26.412 --> 32:28.480
ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE,
RICHARD.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.251
THANKS.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.253
I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT, TOO.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.656
SHE LOOKS GOOD.
IT'S LIKE, UH--LIKE, UH...

32:37.656 --> 32:41.227
FEMININE, BUT IT STILL
MANAGES TO BE PROFESSIONAL.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.595
IS THAT LIKE, A--
LIKE, A PLEATHER?

32:43.595 --> 32:46.432
KMART.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.267
WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN
IS YOUR SHOES, RICHARD.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.902
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THESE.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.638
VIGIs?

32:52.638 --> 32:55.041
YOU OWN A PAIR
OF THESE?

32:55.041 --> 32:56.308
UH...

32:56.308 --> 32:58.077
YOU BOUGHT THEM
AT, UH, SCARLATTI'S,

32:58.077 --> 33:01.947
DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA,
FOR $637.50...

33:01.947 --> 33:05.351
ON YOUR PLATINUM
BANK CARD.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.186
SIZE 12-D.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.624
THIS CAN'T BE
ABOUT MY SHOES.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.160
Cassie: WHY NOT?

33:15.394 --> 33:18.697
THIS IS ABOUT
MY SHOES?

33:18.697 --> 33:20.899
[CHUCKLES]

33:20.899 --> 33:22.234
WHEW.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.436
YOU GOT ME FREAKED OUT
LIKE I DID SOMETHING.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.704
JEEZ.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.239
DID YOU FIND THEM
OR WHAT?

33:29.108 --> 33:30.842
I REPORTED THEM
STOLEN FROM MY LOCKER,

33:30.842 --> 33:32.411
LIKE, 3 WEEKS AGO.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.447
I EVEN FILED A REPORT
WITH THE FRONT OFFICE.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.318
WELL, DID YOU FIND
THOSE SHOES OR NOT?

33:42.121 --> 33:44.156
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:44.156 --> 33:46.158
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

33:46.158 --> 33:49.061
'CAUSE I'M...
SPINNING OUT HERE.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.996
SHOE PRINTS MATCHING THESE
WERE FOUND

33:50.996 --> 33:52.898
AT THE SCENE
OF A MURDER LAST WEEK.

33:52.898 --> 33:55.634
WHAT, THE COVINGTON WOMAN?

33:55.634 --> 33:56.802
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.870
SO, YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON
THAT STOLE MY SHOES

33:58.870 --> 34:01.807
COMMITTED THIS MURDER?

34:01.807 --> 34:03.275
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GONNA COOPERATE

34:03.275 --> 34:04.876
IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.877
YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT

34:05.877 --> 34:07.079
HAVE STOLEN
YOUR BOOTS?

34:07.079 --> 34:08.614
NO, I DON'T.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.282
I WISH I DID NOW, THOUGH.
HEH HEH.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.516
ANY ENEMIES
AT SCHOOL?

34:11.516 --> 34:14.085
OH, WELL,
IT'S HIGH SCHOOL.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.054
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.556
COME ON.
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND ARROGANT,

34:17.556 --> 34:19.056
BUT THERE'S PEOPLE
AT THIS SCHOOL

34:19.056 --> 34:20.092
WHO ENVY ME.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.427
REALLY?

34:21.427 --> 34:22.228
YEAH.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.196
WHY WOULD THEY
DO THAT?

34:25.130 --> 34:28.467
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I'M VERY FORTUNATE,

34:28.467 --> 34:32.036
AND I'VE BEEN BLESSED
IN MANY WAYS.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.906
MUST BE NICE
BEING YOU, RICHARD.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.742
I GOT NO COMPLAINTS.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.112
IT ALL CHECKED OUT.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.280
HE FILED A REPORT
ABOUT THE BOOTS,

34:41.280 --> 34:42.648
JUST LIKE HE SAID,

34:42.648 --> 34:44.049
AND HE MADE A PRETTY BIG
FUSS ABOUT IT,

34:44.049 --> 34:45.516
ACCORDING
TO THE PRINCIPAL.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.686
YEAH, I BET HE WAS
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.089
WELL, SHE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.023
NO, BELIEVE ME.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.226
I HATE KIDS LIKE THAT.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.694
LIKE WHAT?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.166
CASSIE...

35:00.166 --> 35:02.201
WHAT ABOUT
THE STUDY SESSION?

35:03.535 --> 35:05.937
6 KIDS--6 KIDS WERE
AT HIS HOUSE WITH HIM,

35:05.937 --> 35:09.441
UH, FROM APPROXIMATELY
7:00, 7:30 THURSDAY EVENING

35:09.441 --> 35:11.777
TILL 3:00 A.M. FRIDAY.

35:11.777 --> 35:12.811
I TALKED TO ALL OF THEM.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.246
THEY ALL SAID HE WAS THERE
THE WHOLE TIME,

35:14.246 --> 35:15.581
EXCEPT FOR 15 MINUTES,

35:15.581 --> 35:17.649
WHEN HE WENT TO A LOCAL
ATM TO GET CASH

35:17.649 --> 35:18.917
FOR SOME PIZZA
THEY'D ORDERED.

35:18.917 --> 35:19.951
DID YOU CHECK THAT OUT?

35:19.951 --> 35:24.790
YEAH, HE WITHDREW $40
AT 9:19.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.995
GET THAT ENHANCED.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.129
WHY?

35:31.129 --> 35:33.365
BECAUSE I CAN'T
SEE HIS FACE.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.066
WELL, IT'S HIM.

35:35.066 --> 35:38.136
I CAN'T SEE HIS FACE.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.641
YOU REALLY THINK HE HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.642
I DON'T KNOW.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.578
BUT SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT WITH THAT KID.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.681
WELL, LOOK,
15 MINUTES--

35:49.681 --> 35:51.750
IT DOESN'T GIVE HIM
ENOUGH TIME.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.652
HE'S GOT TO DRIVE UP
TO COVINGTON, KILL THE WOMAN,

35:53.652 --> 35:55.921
DUMP HER BODY IN MARIPOSAS
WOODS AND GET BACK.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.689
HE'D NEED AT LEAST AN HOUR.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.472
[CLINKING]

36:29.455 --> 36:30.856
THEY QUESTIONED ME.

36:30.856 --> 36:31.857
AND?

36:31.857 --> 36:33.359
AND IT WAS SO COOL.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.893
DID THEY
GO FOR THE SHOES?

36:34.893 --> 36:36.595
OH, THEY GRABBED IT.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.997
I WAS SO GOOD.
I REALLY WAS. LISTEN...

36:38.997 --> 36:41.199
Richard, on tape: THIS
CAN'T BE ABOUT MY SHOES.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.301
Cassie: WHY NOT?

36:42.301 --> 36:43.469
Richard:
DID YOU FIND THEM OR WHAT?

36:43.469 --> 36:45.471
YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T
SUSPECT ANYTHING?

36:45.471 --> 36:47.539
I MEAN,
YOU DIDN'T OVERDO IT?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.609
A LITTLE BIT.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.745
I OVERDID IT
A LITTLE BIT.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.447
Richard: SO, YOU THINK THAT
THE PERSON THAT STOLE MY SHOES

36:55.447 --> 36:57.816
COMMITTED THIS MURDER?

36:57.816 --> 37:00.452
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GONNA COOPERATE

37:00.452 --> 37:02.854
IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.456
YOU KNOW?
[LAUGHS]

37:04.456 --> 37:05.591
MEET ME AT THE BLUFF
TONIGHT.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.958
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.560
OH, I CAN'T.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.299
WHY NOT?

37:13.299 --> 37:16.134
I--I HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.303
LIKE WHAT?

37:17.303 --> 37:21.273
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
I--I SHOULD...

37:27.846 --> 37:29.515
DO YOU KNOW WHO
THIS KID'S FATHER IS?

37:29.515 --> 37:31.283
Cassie: I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
I WANT TO SEARCH THE HOUSE.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.651
LAWRENCE HAYWOOD.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.353
HE BUILT
THE HILLSDALE MALL.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.221
BIG CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTOR, ROD?

37:36.221 --> 37:37.523
THAT'S RIGHT, CASSIE.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.157
AND I AM NOT ABOUT
TO FUCK WITH A GUY LIKE THAT

37:39.157 --> 37:40.559
ON ANYTHING AS FLIMSY
AS THIS.

37:40.559 --> 37:43.295
I'VE GROWN MUCH TOO FOND
OF MY OWN ASS TO DO ANYTHING

37:43.295 --> 37:44.763
THAT GODDAMN STUPID.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.997
[SIGHS]

37:47.165 --> 37:48.500
AND WHAT
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

37:50.135 --> 37:52.270
Rod: WHERE ARE YOU
ON THIS, SAM?

37:54.440 --> 37:56.608
I DON'T CARE WHO
HIS FATHER IS, EITHER.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.009
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M ASKING.

37:58.009 --> 38:01.613
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO GO AFTER THIS KID?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.284
NO.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.419
AND IF WE
GO IN TOO SOON,

38:07.419 --> 38:08.854

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.119
BUT YOU COULDN'T.

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:06.822
YOU WEREN'T THAT FREE.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.357
THANK GOD.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.129
GO TO HELL.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.198
MY GUY'S
NOT GONNA ROLL.

01:27:16.198 --> 01:27:17.333
REALLY?
MM-MM.

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:18.601
I FIGURED
HE'D BE THE ONE.

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:20.803
NO. LET'S TALK ABOUT
GOLDILOCKS FOR A MINUTE.

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:21.804
LISA.
YEAH.

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:23.472
YOU SAID THAT SHE
WENT OUT WITH RICHARD?

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:25.073
YEAH, BRIEFLY.
SHE FELT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF,

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.942
THEN SHE GOT INTERESTED
IN JUSTIN.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:28.076
LET'S USE THAT.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.012
IT'S AN INTERESTING
THEORY...

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:32.681
BUT I CAN'T ADMIT
TO SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO.

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:35.618
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:37.753
'CAUSE JUSTIN'S
TALKING IN THERE.

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.190
JUSTIN'S HERE?

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.592
MM-HMM.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.533
HE TOLD US ABOUT YOU,

01:27:50.533 --> 01:27:52.568
ABOUT YOU AND LISA.

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:00.876
OH...[LAUGHS]

01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:05.448
WHICH LISA? HA.

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.819
SO YOU REALLY NEED TO
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:15.157
JUST THINK OF IT
AS A GAME.

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:17.393
WHOEVER TALKS FIRST
IS THE WINNER.

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:22.531
JUSTIN'S SAYING
YOU BETRAYED HIM.

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:25.734
HE TOLD US ABOUT LISA
AND THE TAPE YOU MADE.

01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:30.573
JUSTIN'S TALKING.

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:32.508
HE'S GONNA WIN
THIS THING, RICHARD.

01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:34.743
UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL ME.

01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:39.682
OK, I'M GONNA
GO SEE.

01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:43.919
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:49.024
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

01:28:57.299 --> 01:28:59.034
I HAVE TO ADVISE YOU

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:00.903
OF CERTAIN RIGHTS.

01:29:00.903 --> 01:29:03.305
THE INTERVIEW IS OVER.

01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:05.307
RICHARD'S FATHER
SENT HIS LAWYER.

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:07.810
CHARGE THEM
OR LET THEM GO.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.303
ANOTHER 10 MINUTES, 5,
WE WOULD HAVE HAD THOSE KIDS.

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.672
BOTH OF THEM.

01:29:36.672 --> 01:29:38.574
MAN, IF I EVER FIND OUT
WHO LEAKED TO THE PARENTS,

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:40.375
I SWEAR TO GOD...

01:29:43.946 --> 01:29:45.514
NO, NO.

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:47.215
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, UH...

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.652
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW.

01:29:49.652 --> 01:29:52.220
YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING
THAT'S STOPPING HIM, JUSTIN,

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.589
FROM TALKING?

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:56.358
SAID HE NEEDS TO PROVE
HE'S AS TOUGH AS HIS BUDDY.

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:57.426
HE'S TOUGHER.

01:29:57.426 --> 01:29:59.027
YEAH, MAYBE.
BUT THAT RICHARD...

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:01.930
I'M TELLING YOU, I CANNOT
WAIT TILL WE NAIL HIM.

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.165
WELL, LOOK,

01:30:03.165 --> 01:30:05.367
ONE OF THEM'S THE DOER,
AND HE'S GOING DOWN.

01:30:05.367 --> 01:30:06.502
BUT, I MEAN...

01:30:06.502 --> 01:30:07.570
YEAH, IT HAPPENS.

01:30:07.570 --> 01:30:08.971
IT HAPPENS.
THERE'S SOMETHING...

01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:11.807
YOU GET A NARCISSISTIC PRICK
LIKE RICHARD HAYWOOD

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:14.209
WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF...

01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:17.345
I'M TELLING YOU, HE USES JUSTIN
SOLELY TO FEED HIS EGO,

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.414
PUSH HIM AROUND,
HE CAN FEEL LIKE A MAN.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.216
5 YEARS FROM NOW
WHEN NO ONE EVEN CARES

01:30:21.216 --> 01:30:24.152
THAT HE WAS HOMECOMING KING
OR FUNNY IN THE LUNCHROOM

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.789
OR STATE POLE VAULTING CHAMP,
I PITY ANYBODY

01:30:26.789 --> 01:30:28.691
WHO GETS IN HIS WAY--
ANYBODY.

01:30:28.691 --> 01:30:30.358
IS RICHARD
A POLE VAULTER?

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.094
NO--I DON'T KNOW.

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:36.031
I MEAN, I WAS JUST USING IT
AS AN EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW...

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.901
LOOK, UM...

01:30:38.901 --> 01:30:40.469
LOOK.

01:30:42.705 --> 01:30:44.773
I--I KNOW ABOUT
CARL HUDSON.

01:30:51.046 --> 01:30:53.148
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.653
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR
GOD--THIS IS MY--

01:30:57.653 --> 01:30:59.221
THIS IS MY--
MY MATTER!

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:00.656
MINE!

01:31:35.691 --> 01:31:38.460
I KNEW THIS GIRL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.729
SMART ENOUGH, BUT...

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:43.632
SHE DIDN'T REALLY
COME FROM ANYTHING.

01:31:43.632 --> 01:31:45.167
AND TO EVERYONE'S
AMAZEMENT,

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:47.936
THE MOST POPULAR BOY
IN SCHOOL LIKED HER.

01:31:49.137 --> 01:31:50.839
STATE POLE VAULTING CHAMP.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:54.777
AND YOU WOULD WATCH HIM GO OVER
THAT BAR IN THE SUNLIGHT...

01:31:54.777 --> 01:31:57.312
THAT GOLDEN BODY.
IT WAS LIKE...

01:31:57.312 --> 01:32:01.016
LIFE JUST COULDN'T GET
ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:04.587
AND IT DIDN'T.

01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:08.724
SHE WAS 16
WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM.

01:32:08.724 --> 01:32:12.194
17 WHEN HE KNOCKED OUT
HER UPPER BICUSPID,

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:14.396
18 WHEN SHE SAID
SHE WAS LEAVING.

01:32:14.396 --> 01:32:16.064
HE PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:18.033
WITH A PRETTY SERIOUS
CONCUSSION.

01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:21.670
A WEEK LATER
WHEN SHE GOT OUT,

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:24.807
SHE STARTED PACKING,
AND HE WAS DRUNK.

01:32:24.807 --> 01:32:27.810
POINTED HIS FINGER AT HER,
HE SAID,

01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:31.079
"YOU TRY THAT AGAIN,
I'LL KILL YOU."

01:32:32.414 --> 01:32:34.549
HE TOOK ANOTHER DRINK,

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.852
AND SHE HEADED
FOR THE DOOR.

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:41.023
WHY DIDN'T SHE WAIT
TILL HE WAS OUT,

01:32:41.023 --> 01:32:42.357
LEFT FOR WORK?

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:45.027
'CAUSE SHE COULDN'T.
SHE HAD TO GO RIGHT THEN.

01:32:45.027 --> 01:32:46.294
WHY THEN?

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:47.763
I--I DON'T KNOW.

01:32:47.763 --> 01:32:50.265
IT WAS BECAUSE...

01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:52.567
'CAUSE SHE...

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.603
[SIGHS]

01:32:56.839 --> 01:32:59.441
BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABOUT
GETTING AWAY FROM HIM.

01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:01.810
IT WAS ABOUT
STANDING UP TO HIM.

01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:04.312
EVEN IF HE KILLED HER.

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:06.281
I GUESS SO.

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:10.385
SO HE STABBED HER
17 TIMES

01:33:10.385 --> 01:33:12.087
WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.290
AND DUMPED HER BODY
ON A COUNTRY ROAD.

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:21.630
YEAH. RUINED
MY FAVORITE DRESS.

01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:24.833
CARL HUDSON.

01:33:26.401 --> 01:33:28.804
CUTEST BOY I EVER SAW.

01:33:30.305 --> 01:33:32.274
UNTIL RICHARD HAYWOOD.

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:41.784
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
TESTIFY

01:33:41.784 --> 01:33:43.518
AT CARL'S
PAROLE HEARING.

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:44.720
MM-HMM.

01:33:46.588 --> 01:33:48.857
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY?

01:33:49.992 --> 01:33:52.828
NOTHING. I'M NOT GOING.

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:55.563
I'M NOT.

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:58.233
YOU GOTTA GO UP THERE.
YOU HAVE TO.

01:33:58.233 --> 01:33:59.467
NO. I DON'T HAVE TO.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:02.137
THE GIRL WITH THE DRESS,
THAT WAS JESSICA MARIE HUDSON,

01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:04.106
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY ABOUT HER.

01:34:04.106 --> 01:34:06.875
YOU JUST INHERITED
HER SCARS.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:09.144
LOOK, I MADE A DEAL.

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:12.147
AND THE DEAL WAS
THAT SHE DIED BACK THERE.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:15.517
SHE'S IN THE GROUND,
AND I CAN GO ON WITH MY LIFE.

01:34:15.517 --> 01:34:17.052
EXCEPT YOU CAN'T,
CAN YOU?

01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:19.321
'CAUSE ALL YOU THINK
ABOUT IS CARL HUDSON.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:22.590
HE'S EVERY CASE.
HE'S EVERY GUY YOU DATE.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:25.160
YOUR WHOLE WORLD
IS CARL HUDSON.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.764
IS THAT THE LIFE
YOU'RE GOIN' ON WITH?

01:34:30.766 --> 01:34:33.235
DID YOU EVER GET HELP
FOR ANY OF THIS?

01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:34.903
YEAH.

01:34:34.903 --> 01:34:37.806
I BECAME A COP.

01:34:41.043 --> 01:34:43.645
YOU CAN'T JUST PRETEND
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

01:34:43.645 --> 01:34:45.513
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE,
CASS.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.649
OH...IT HAS TO BE.

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:50.318
BECAUSE IF IT GETS
ANY MORE COMPLICATED,

01:34:50.318 --> 01:34:52.254
I CAN'T MAKE IT.

01:34:58.894 --> 01:35:01.997
Woman: RICHARD HAYWOOD
IS ON LINE ONE.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.867
SWANSON.

01:35:04.867 --> 01:35:06.869
SO YOU WANNA TALK TO ME

01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:08.470
ABOUT THIS COVINGTON
WOMAN, OR WHAT?

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:11.439
YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

01:35:13.809 --> 01:35:16.779
WELL, I KNOW JUSTIN
ALREADY TALKED TO YOU.

01:35:16.779 --> 01:35:18.180
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANNA KNOW

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.482
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME.

01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:23.685
HOW DO YOU PICK THE VICTIM,
HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH IT?

01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:25.487
YOU KNOW, WE WERE BORED.

01:35:25.487 --> 01:35:29.424
I NEVER TOOK IT SERIOUSLY
UNTIL I WALK INTO THE ROOM

01:35:29.424 --> 01:35:32.160
AND SHE'S LAYING THERE.

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.097
DID YOU MAKE A DEAL
WITH THAT BASTARD?

01:35:35.097 --> 01:35:36.965
HE SAYS HE WASN'T THERE
WHEN IT WENT DOWN.

01:35:36.965 --> 01:35:38.466
AL, DID YOU MAKE
A DEAL?

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:39.868
I DON'T MAKE DEALS
OVER THE PHONE, CASSIE,

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:41.403
BUT IF WHAT THIS KID SAYS
CHECKS OUT,

01:35:41.403 --> 01:35:43.605
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
CONVICT EITHER ONE OF THEM,

01:35:43.605 --> 01:35:44.672
THEN MAYBE I WILL.

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:45.874
FINE. THEN
LET'S GET WARRANTS

01:35:45.874 --> 01:35:47.209
ON BOTH OF THEM
RIGHT NOW.

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.573
Woman: RICHARD,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:20.909
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
WITHOUT TELLING US.

01:36:20.909 --> 01:36:22.177
IT'S A CONDITION OF--

01:36:22.177 --> 01:36:25.180
RICHARD. WELL, WILL YOU
BE BACK FOR DINNER?

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.982
[SIREN]

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:37.792
NO, JUSTIN'S NOT HERE.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:39.194
HIS MOTHER THOUGHT
HE WAS IN HIS ROOM,

01:36:39.194 --> 01:36:40.595
BUT SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHEN HE LEFT.

01:36:40.595 --> 01:36:42.797
YEAH, SIMILAR STORY HERE.
WHAT ABOUT GOLDILOCKS?

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:44.066
LISA?

01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:45.667
YEAH, LISA. WHY
DON'T YOU GET OVER THERE

01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:47.035
AND SEE WHAT SHE KNOWS.

01:36:47.035 --> 01:36:48.670
DETECTIVE, YOU MIGHT WANNA
TAKE A LOOK DOWNSTAIRS.

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:49.905
OK. GOTTA GO. BYE.

01:37:37.552 --> 01:37:41.056
I DIDN'T...I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

01:37:47.429 --> 01:37:49.998
WILL YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:51.866
THE COPS ARE
ASKING ME QUESTIONS

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:53.268
ABOUT YOU AND RICHARD,

01:37:53.268 --> 01:37:55.070
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

01:37:56.638 --> 01:37:58.340
WE KILLED A WOMAN.

01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.541
[LAUGHS]

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:01.109
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:38:02.577 --> 01:38:04.412
YES, WE DID.

01:38:10.018 --> 01:38:11.386
JUSTIN...

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:18.093
HE MADE YOU DO IT.

01:38:18.093 --> 01:38:20.695
IT WASN'T JUST RICHARD.

01:38:20.695 --> 01:38:24.566
BUT HE DROVE IT.
IT WAS HIS IDEA.

01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:27.302
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS

01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:29.337
BY YOURSELF.

01:38:31.706 --> 01:38:33.675
HE SEDUCED YOU.

01:38:35.777 --> 01:38:37.980
JUST LIKE
HE SEDUCED ME.

01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:43.751
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO?

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.787
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
EVERYTHING.

01:38:45.787 --> 01:38:48.156
I WILL. I WILL.

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:52.094
I DON'T HAVE
