03:02.382 --> 03:03.622
can I borrow a tie?

03:03.650 --> 03:05.425
- For what'?

03:05.451 --> 03:06.828
- Mine has shit on it.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.560
I got a job interview.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.363
- Okay, you just,
uh, clean yours?

03:10.390 --> 03:12.802
- No.
I'm too pressed for time.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.463
Today's soccer,
plus I'm captain this week,

03:14.494 --> 03:15.564
so I'm in charge
of bringing all the goals,

03:15.595 --> 03:18.576
and fuckin' Agro Mike's
got a UTI.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.838
- Uh, well,
they're in the top drawer.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.844
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.210
- Wait, hey,
when are you coming back?

03:22.235 --> 03:24.237
- I don't know.
I was thinking a couple days.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.248
- All right.
Let me know how it goes.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.341
- Yeah.
- All right, see you, man.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.407
- All right.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.821
- I never knew it was possible
to be so bored

03:31.844 --> 03:35.314
and stressed at the same time.

03:57.303 --> 04:03.948
<i>II</i>

04:03.977 --> 04:06.321
- <i>Yeah, no,
I'm halfway there now.</i>

04:09.282 --> 04:10.852
<i>I'll just look it up
on my phone if/ get lost.</i>

04:10.883 --> 04:12.362
<i>Don't Worry.</i>

04:15.321 --> 04:17.801
<i>Yeah, no.
Well, then, I'll pull over.</i>

04:19.024 --> 04:21.369
Yeah, no.
It'll be fine.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.808
Yeah, listen,
I don't want to get a ticket.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.710
I don't want to get pulled over,
so I'll-I'll, uh-

04:27.734 --> 04:29.805
I'll give you a call
when I get there.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.447
Okay.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.481
Yeah, no, Mom,
I know what he's like, okay?

04:38.511 --> 04:40.354
You don't have to coach me.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.389
All right, yeah.
No, I'm hanging up now.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.659
<i>AH right, bye.</i>

04:56.329 --> 05:04.339
<i>II</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:09.843
Hey.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.473
Dad.

06:12.638 --> 06:13.480
Len.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.510
<i>_</i>

06:23.483 --> 06:24.484
Hello, Max.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.460
- Uh, what are you doing?

06:28.488 --> 06:30.593
- Fucking swimming.
What's it look like?

06:32.125 --> 06:34.127
- The water's disgusting.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.468
- No, it's not.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.601
It's nature.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.702
It's like swimming
in a pond with steps.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.606
It's what man was meant
to swim in.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.949
Besides, I think
the pool guy's quit.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.819
- He quit?
Why?

06:51.844 --> 06:52.822
- I don't know.

06:52.845 --> 06:53.846
He just doesn't
come round anymore.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.417
- Have you tried calling him?

06:56.449 --> 06:58.190
- Yeah, well,
that's part of the problem.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.630
Never been properly introduced.

07:01.654 --> 07:05.158
Tessa used to take care
of all that shit.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.431
He was a pissant, anyway,

07:06.459 --> 07:08.166
always rushing around.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.434
- I bet I could find him.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.466
- Don't bother.
He's fired.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.673
Cheeky fucking cunt bastard.

07:21.674 --> 07:22.675
- So, uh...

07:25.178 --> 07:27.590
To what do I owe
the honor of this visit?

07:27.613 --> 07:29.559
- I just thought
I'd check up on you,

07:29.582 --> 07:30.925
see if you're okay.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.859
I tried calling.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.965
- I see you brought a bag.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.703
- Yeah, I, uh-l thought
I'd stay for a couple of days.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.102
Yeah, no one's heard from you
in a while, you know?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.916
You must be cold.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.114
- No, I'm not.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.042
- I mean, you really got

08:19.065 --> 08:20.772
the whole "Grey Gardens"
thing going.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.280
I like it.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.983
- Yeah, well, I wasn't
expecting any visitors.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.575
Yeah.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.553
- No phones up here.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.680
- Are you serious?
- Don't want to see it.

08:33.546 --> 08:34.547
. Okay"

08:34.580 --> 08:36.287
- I want to hear myself think
for a change.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.927
I mean it.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.232
- So, uh, uh, when did you
break up with Tess?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.601
- Awhile ago.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.861
- What happened?

08:50.663 --> 08:53.542
- She was an underfed coyote,
poor thing.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.717
Time came for her
to go foraging.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.878
- Man, I'm-l'm sorry
to hear that.

09:05.912 --> 09:08.188
- It's all right, Max.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.716
I know the game.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.834
So while we're on the subject,
what can I do for you?

09:23.863 --> 09:25.342
- Um, nothing, l just-
- Do you need money?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.339
- I was just planning
on hang-hanging out-

09:26.566 --> 09:28.341
- There's got to be some
expense I'm not covering.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.603
- It's nothing like that.

09:29.635 --> 09:30.807
- Want me to make a call
for you?

09:30.836 --> 09:32.281
Get you a label?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.114
- No.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.983
It's not...

09:36.008 --> 09:37.248
- I'm a very
successful man, Max.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.619
High up on the totem pole.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.681
- I'm well aware.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.327
- What do you need, then?

09:44.350 --> 09:45.920
- I don't need anything.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.728
I'm just visiting.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.702
- Your hair's longer.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.768
- Yeah.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.076
It's been, uh-
it's been like this for a while.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.283
- All right.
Stay.

10:08.307 --> 10:11.345
Don't distract me.
I need to focus.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.913
. Okay"

10:15.648 --> 10:18.094
What are-what are you
doing, exactly?

10:18.117 --> 10:19.221
- Thinking.

10:20.219 --> 10:21.357
- Yeah, what are
you thinking about?

10:21.387 --> 10:22.957
- Everything.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.101
The whole Charade.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.195
"S h a-rad e."

10:28.628 --> 10:29.402
- All right, well,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
I'm gonna go to my room.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.369
- <i>Right, you've got
30 seconds,</i>

10:35.401 --> 10:37.039
or on top of motor theft,

10:37.069 --> 10:38.275
<i>ifs resisting arrest</i>

10:38.304 --> 10:40.147
<i>and assault
with a deadly weapon.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:41.651
<i>- And forgery.</i>

10:44.677 --> 10:52.687
<i>II</i>

10:57.890 --> 10:59.198
<i>- Uh, shall we start?</i>

10:59.225 --> 11:00.863
<i>- Yeah, go for H.</i>

11:00.893 --> 11:02.702
- <i>Um, do you feel
like you've matured?</i>

11:03.829 --> 11:05.240
- What do you mean?

11:05.264 --> 11:06.902
- There's a rawness
to the new album

11:06.932 --> 11:09.970
that feels like a departure
and an evolution.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.107
- Thank you.
Yeah.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.674
Yeah, I'd say those things.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.981
- Do you feel like this is
an accurate snapshot of Zoe?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.389
Maybe.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.292
- Okay. Sorry, let me come
at this a different way.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.886
You've basically, you know,
grown up in public.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.694
Famous since you were
16 years old.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.462
Every mistake you make,
your fashion choices,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.135
your romantic choices,

11:32.158 --> 11:34.001
all get catalogued
very publicly.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.235
I mean, what's that
been like for you?

11:37.263 --> 11:40.301
- Uh, I don't...

11:40.332 --> 11:42.175
know really what you're asking.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.111
- Well, it's not exactly

11:43.135 --> 11:45.979
how everyone spends
their teenage years,

11:46.005 --> 11:47.848
but you seem
to have come through it,

11:47.873 --> 11:50.945
maybe with a-
a hard-won wisdom.

11:50.976 --> 11:51.954
- I don't know.

11:51.977 --> 11:55.789
L'm-l mean,
it's the only experience

11:55.815 --> 11:56.987
I've ever had, you know.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.428
So that's it.

12:02.455 --> 12:10.431
<i>II</i>

12:13.466 --> 12:21.476
<i>II</i>

12:57.276 --> 12:58.346
- <i>Think you're
talking to, Regan?</i>

12:58.377 --> 13:00.323
- <i>Do you Want me
to answer that?</i>

13:00.346 --> 13:01.984
- Hey, Len.
- Hey.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.858
- I figured out the ground
shield situation.

13:04.884 --> 13:07.364
It was connected at the source,
causing a ground loop,

13:07.386 --> 13:09.525
and the links
were stuffed inside

13:09.555 --> 13:11.034
an old Burger King container.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.225
- Right.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.237
- I replaced the links,

13:14.260 --> 13:16.262
and I threw out
the Burger King container.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.137
I hope that's okay.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.972
I didn't know if you were
saving it for any reason.

13:18.998 --> 13:19.840
- No.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.572
That sounds like
the right decision.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.940
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Max.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.141
Len's son.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.582
- Oh, Max, this is William.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.443
He lives down the road.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.508
He comes in once in a while,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.987
checks I'm not dead.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.251
He's in charge of general
maintenance, house morale,

13:33.279 --> 13:34.553
that sort of thing.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.582
Got an office in the barn.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.352
- Mm.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.489
- L, uh, stacked the cables
at the studio door.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.431
- All right.
You have fun.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.058
- Yeah.
See you tomorrow.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.228
It was nice to meet you, Max.
- Good to meet you.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.961
- Cheers, William.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.135
- Where'd you find him?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.143
- Tessa.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.074
- A little bit awkward.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.513
- He is, a little bit.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.109
Or "real" is a better way
of putting it.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.853
- I have to ask you
about Len Black,

14:08.881 --> 14:11.191
your longtime collaborator
and producer.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.322
Were you as caught off guard
as everyone else

14:13.352 --> 14:15.923
by what he did
at the award show last month?

14:15.955 --> 14:18.401
- Yeah.
I was, for sure.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.961
- What do you think
prompted that?

14:22.328 --> 14:24.308
- Can I use your pen?

14:24.330 --> 14:26.139
- Yeah.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.042
- Thanks, man.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.418
Ask Len...

14:36.275 --> 14:39.017
Why he didn't want award.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.086
Awesome.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.961
It was good talking to you.

14:47.987 --> 14:48.988
Um, I have to go.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.932

15:12.912 --> 15:13.617
He didn't recognize me.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.422
- Have you ever thought
about getting Apple TV?

15:16.448 --> 15:18.155
- What's that?

15:18.183 --> 15:19.992
- It's like this little box,

15:20.019 --> 15:21.157
and you just hook it up
to your TV,

15:21.186 --> 15:24.565
and you can stream
pretty much anything.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.297
It's, like, so you don't have
to keep getting these DVDs.

I think you'd like it.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.544

15:36.568 --> 15:38.309
- Fruit cocktail.
- Hmm.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.287
- Do you remember
those parties that you and Mom

15:46.312 --> 15:49.350
used to have at the apartment
on Varick Street?

15:51.650 --> 15:53.630
When I was, like, six?

15:53.652 --> 15:55.632
- Party's a nice word for it.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.498
- Yeah, like, I remember

15:58.524 --> 16:00.367
I was the bartender,

16:00.392 --> 16:02.497
and everyone thought
it was so funny.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.134
Like, I wore my blazer, and...

16:05.164 --> 16:08.168
God, everyone was so wasted.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.407
- You're too sensitive.
That's your problem.

16:11.403 --> 16:14.384
- What are you talking about?
I'm saying it was fun.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.087
- You've always been
too sensitive.

16:19.411 --> 16:20.754
That's why you're terrible
at sports.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.357

I'm fine at sports.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.985

you're truly good at something.

Some Western
I found in the house.

20:31.763 --> 20:32.935

20:32.965 --> 20:34.376
- Just you listening
to a book on tape.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.878
- It's well-written.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.278

20:40.606 --> 20:43.246
It's-their life was simple

20:43.275 --> 20:45.755
and just ponced around
on your horse

20:45.777 --> 20:48.257
and bossed cows around

It was easy.

I can wear what I want

20:56.788 --> 20:57.789

Okay?

20:58.824 --> 21:00.735
I've earned it.

21:01.893 --> 21:03.304
- I was just saying.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.308
- Not like your dilettante
hipster mates

21:05.330 --> 21:06.536
with their skinny jeans

21:06.565 --> 21:07.441
and their skinny ties, and-

What are you up to?
Did you end up getting that job?

23:34.045 --> 23:35.820

of stiff competition.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.885
It's politics, you know.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.555

- Yep.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.795
It's for the predators, Max.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.771
- The raccoons
are out of control.

24:24.796 --> 24:28.141
We set up eight traps
in different locations,

24:28.166 --> 24:31.613
and then as we catch them, I'll
deport them across the Hudson.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.014
I made maps for Len and I
of where they're placed.

24:34.039 --> 24:35.712
I could make you one, too,

24:49.754 --> 24:51.631

he was giving one.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.896
- It's not a speech.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.802

25:02.634 --> 25:03.942
which is way better.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.611
Bring Your Parent to School Day

25:09.641 --> 25:11.052
- Sort of, but it doesn't have
to be your parent.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.646
It just has to be
someone old who has a job.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.123
- Flattery will get
you everywhere, William.

25:17.816 --> 25:20.524

the Man City-Liverpool game.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.656

25:21.686 --> 25:22.824

26:27.953 --> 26:29.899
- I'm going to see Len.

26:32.157 --> 26:35.036
- Are you, uh-are you okay?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.334
- No, not really.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.906
- Hey, there's some extra
napkins and shit in the bag.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.175
- Cool, man.
Thank you so much.

26:46.838 --> 26:49.250
- <i>Percy, you see
how the king picks me out</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:50.981
<i>for special greeting'?</i>

26:51.009 --> 26:52.647
<i>- No, my lord.</i>

26:52.677 --> 26:54.350
<i>- I saw H, my lord.</i>

26:54.379 --> 26:58.054
- <i>Ah, and What is your name,
little fellow?</i>

26:58.083 --> 26:59.721
<i>- My name is Baldrick, my lord.</i>

26:59.751 --> 27:02.698
<i>- Ah, then I shall call you...</i>

27:02.721 --> 27:03.665
<i>Baldrick.</i>

27:03.688 --> 27:05.634
- <i>And I shall call you
"my lord,"</i>

27:05.657 --> 27:07.762
<i>my lord.</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:09.635
<i>- I like the out of your job,</i>

27:09.661 --> 27:11.299
<i>young fellow m'lad.</i>

27:11.329 --> 27:13.275
- Hey, can I ask you something?

27:13.298 --> 27:15.005
- Mm-hmm.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.013
- Do you ever miss
being in a band?

27:18.670 --> 27:20.650
- There's bits about it I miss.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.378
It was a fucked-up time.

27:26.344 --> 27:29.154
People like to romanticize
that sort of thing, you know?

27:29.180 --> 27:31.387
- Yeah.

27:31.416 --> 27:32.793
Man, I just-

27:32.817 --> 27:35.161
it just must have been like...

27:35.186 --> 27:37.689
you know, just playing
whatever you wanted to play

27:37.722 --> 27:40.965
and not having,
I don't know, just-

27:40.992 --> 27:42.869
it must have been a great time
to be an artist.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.397
<i>- Have you lost your conkers?</i>

27:45.430 --> 27:47.034
- <i>So you Won?</i>

27:47.065 --> 27:50.410
- Yeah, there were bits
about it that were fantastic.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.748
- Yeah, you know,
things are actually pretty-

27:55.774 --> 27:57.378
going pretty okay
for my band right now.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.915
- Right.

28:01.946 --> 28:06.088
- Yeah, I mean, Zach-
like, he's such a stoner, but-

28:06.117 --> 28:08.393
but he's, like, so talented.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.257
You know, I-and I have to be
the one that-

28:12.290 --> 28:14.896
to kind of, like, bring
everybody together.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.769
It's...

28:19.964 --> 28:21.170
Yeah.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.371
I don't know, even-
like, we even-

28:24.402 --> 28:26.313
we wrote some new songs

28:26.337 --> 28:29.011
and have some pretty decent
recordings now.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.050
And, uh, like...

28:34.079 --> 28:36.923
I don't know, we've been
playing shows too in Brooklyn.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.360
Like, nothing big, but we've
had a pretty good responses-

28:40.385 --> 28:41.420
- Yeah, that's, that's great.

28:41.453 --> 28:42.864
Good.
- Yeah.

28:42.887 --> 28:43.888
- Great.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.031
- I mean, it's going, yeah.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.335
- Before they don
<i>armor</i> tomorrow.

28:50.361 --> 28:51.965
- Yeah, I mean, we've-
we-we even planned out,

28:51.996 --> 28:53.100
like, our goals for the year.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.336
- Goals?

28:57.368 --> 28:58.403
- Yeah.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.143
Like, I mean, the same-
they're the same goals

29:00.171 --> 29:03.084
as last year, but we just have
a different date on it.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.747
- Huh.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.280
- 'Cause, yeah.

29:08.313 --> 29:09.314
What?

29:12.817 --> 29:14.990
- I want to show you something.

29:17.322 --> 29:18.801
- What are you...

29:20.492 --> 29:22.165
Should I come-
should I follow you?

29:22.193 --> 29:23.331
- Yes, you should.
- All right.

29:23.361 --> 29:24.533
- There's going to have to be

29:24.763 --> 29:27.471
<i>a certain amount
of violence.</i>

29:39.210 --> 29:40.211
- Do you know what this is?

29:41.212 --> 29:43.123
- It's your favorite guitar.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.149
. Yep-

29:45.150 --> 29:46.993
My first Telecaster.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.462
Hold it.

30:03.568 --> 30:04.546
- It's light.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.809
- Yeah.

30:05.837 --> 30:06.907
- It's like-

30:06.938 --> 30:09.316
- Feel the ash grain
through the finish, can't you?

30:09.340 --> 30:10.341
- Yeah.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.120
- Don't look at your hands.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.885
Only girl guitarists
look at their hands.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.157
. Okay"

30:23.855 --> 30:26.096
Oh, man.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.229
- You feel all right?
- Sure, yeah.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.296
- You feel cool, yeah?
- I feel all right.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.069
- Feel the velocity?

30:32.096 --> 30:33.074
- I feel something.

30:33.097 --> 30:34.098
- Right.
Go on, smash it.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.133
- What?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.201
- Hold it high above your head

30:36.234 --> 30:37.838
and bring it crashing down
to the ground.

30:37.869 --> 30:40.543
- You're joking, right?
- No.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.055
- It's gonna break.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.492
- Yeah, it'll probably snap in
half, and all these little bits

30:51.516 --> 30:53.894
will go flying round the room.

30:55.286 --> 30:56.196
- This is so stupid.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.223
- It's fucking mental,
so do it.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.134
- No.
- Don't think about it.

31:00.158 --> 31:02.399
Don't think about
the consequences, Max.

31:02.427 --> 31:03.963
Just fucking do something.
- This is-

31:03.995 --> 31:06.305
- Fucking break it.

31:06.331 --> 31:07.571
- No.
No.

31:32.490 --> 31:33.969
- Your mum...

31:35.660 --> 31:37.003
She ever ask about me?

31:37.028 --> 31:39.008
- What?

31:41.065 --> 31:42.066
Who's that?

31:43.434 --> 31:45.004
- Fucking hell.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.205
- What?

31:48.239 --> 31:49.183
- Who is it?

31:49.207 --> 31:51.187
- Fuck.
I don't know, do I?

32:00.351 --> 32:02.627
Oh, fuck me sideways.

32:02.654 --> 32:03.496
- What?
- Shh.

32:03.521 --> 32:04.363
Who is it?

32:04.389 --> 32:06.630
- Shh, get away
from the fucking window!

32:06.658 --> 32:08.160
. Okay"

32:08.192 --> 32:09.330
- Fuck.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.566
- Who is it?

32:12.530 --> 32:13.508
- Get down!

32:13.531 --> 32:17.604
Don't-just don't
fucking move a muscle.

32:17.635 --> 32:18.579
- Who is it?
- Down.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.640
Just fucking ignore her.
She might go away.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.980
- Ignore who?

32:24.008 --> 32:27.387
- Fucking mother-
a box of fucking frogs, man.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.221
- Is that Zoe?
- Yes, it is fucking Zoe.

32:29.247 --> 32:30.624
- Why are you-
what are you doing?

32:30.648 --> 32:33.026
- <i>Go fuck yourself, Len.
loan hear you.</i>

32:33.051 --> 32:33.688
- Oh.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.164
Holy Mary, mother of Christ.
- Come on, Len, let me in!

32:36.187 --> 32:37.530
- Help me now
in my hour of need.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.398
<i>- I'm in the back, Len.</i>

32:39.424 --> 32:40.732
_
<i>'</i> Lem'

32:40.959 --> 32:41.733
- Okay, let her in.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.497
Let her in.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.167
- Len, open the door.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.271
- Hey, Max.
- Oh, hi.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.645
Hi.
- Wow.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.672
How are you?
- I'm doing okay.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.617
- Good to see you.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.586
Surprise.

33:01.212 --> 33:02.350
I was just
in the neighborhood.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.757
I thought I'd drop by
and find out

33:03.982 --> 33:05.427
what the fuck
was going with you.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.986
- What're you doing here?

33:07.018 --> 33:08.725
- I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.289
I called you, like,
a million times.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.561
- I'm trying to be alone.

33:11.589 --> 33:13.159
- Well, you can't.
- I can't?

33:13.191 --> 33:15.193
- No.
- Why not?

33:15.226 --> 33:16.569
- Because that's not fair.

33:16.594 --> 33:17.572
- My God...

33:17.595 --> 33:20.371
this is a fucking ambush.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.677
My sanctuary's been invaded
by needy little piglets.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.746
I've got to lie down.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.320
Piglets with their teeth
in my neck...

33:35.446 --> 33:37.357
Sucking my blood.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.031
- He's in a good mood.
- Yeah.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.693
- Do you have a toothbrush
i could borrow?

33:52.463 --> 33:58.709
<i>II</i>

33:58.736 --> 34:01.080
<i>- We are in for a treat today.</i>

34:01.105 --> 34:04.086
Our speakers are Len Black,
William's employer,

34:04.108 --> 34:06.520
and Mr. Frank Coulter,

34:06.544 --> 34:07.818
Derek's dad.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.581
Now, Mr. Black
is gonna share with us

34:09.614 --> 34:12.458
his experience of working
in the music industry,

34:12.483 --> 34:14.588
and Mr. Coulter
will talk to us

34:14.619 --> 34:17.293
about what it feels like
to own your own business.

34:17.321 --> 34:19.766
Mr. Black, would you
like to start us off?

34:24.262 --> 34:25.263
Hello, children.

34:28.065 --> 34:31.275
Right.
So, uh, my experience, right.

34:31.302 --> 34:33.304
So, uh, yeah, well, my family-

34:33.337 --> 34:35.510
there was me, me mum, me dad.

34:35.540 --> 34:38.783
Grew up in a shitty
little town in the UK.

34:38.810 --> 34:39.788
We were poor,

34:39.811 --> 34:41.688
like everyone else
who lived near us,

34:41.712 --> 34:42.850
which I hated.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.286
My dad had a shit job

34:44.315 --> 34:45.851
at a factory.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.427
He was drunk most of the time,

34:47.452 --> 34:49.295
so he had no interest
in having a relationship

34:49.320 --> 34:50.264
with me or anything.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.165
He was a miserable
old cunt, really.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.136
Probably still is.

34:54.158 --> 34:56.603
My mum taught piano lessons
to most of the neighbors' kids,

34:56.627 --> 34:59.233
so that's how I got
interested in music,

34:59.263 --> 35:00.799
but then, uh, I left school

35:00.832 --> 35:03.335
when I was about 16,
ran away from home-

35:03.367 --> 35:05.176
about your age, actually-
so, uh,

35:05.203 --> 35:06.375
well done for not doing that.

35:07.672 --> 35:10.152
Yeah, next portion of my life
l spent drinking,

35:10.174 --> 35:11.847
getting into trouble, fighting,

35:11.876 --> 35:13.878
taking drugs, nicking cars,

35:14.112 --> 35:15.853
that sort of thing, you know.

35:15.880 --> 35:16.881
You know what I mean.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.456
And then, um, eventually,

35:19.484 --> 35:21.828
me and a couple of mates
started a band.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.231
I had one T-shirt,
which I wore every day,

35:24.255 --> 35:26.326
and we all lived
in this tiny little fucking

35:26.357 --> 35:28.735
size of a janitor's closet.

35:28.759 --> 35:31.262
We were angry.
We were pissed off.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.273
We were skint-

35:32.296 --> 35:34.367
poor, that means.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.742
But we managed somehow
to make a single,

35:36.767 --> 35:37.837
a record,

35:37.869 --> 35:39.507
which to everyone's surprise

35:39.537 --> 35:40.914
was a bit of a success,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.641
but then the drugs
and the drink

35:42.673 --> 35:45.745
and all that fucking bollocks
got a hold of us,

35:45.776 --> 35:47.346
so that went tits up.

35:47.378 --> 35:49.289
So the next few years
of my life,

35:49.313 --> 35:50.314
I did fuck all,

35:50.348 --> 35:51.588
really.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.357
Then my girlfriend got pregnant

35:53.384 --> 35:55.227
by me, apparently.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.357
Wave hello, Max.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.465
Yeah, and then
I got into producing music,

36:00.491 --> 36:02.232
which is a bit more lucrative.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.466
You know, support the family,

36:03.494 --> 36:05.872
but then I couldn't kick
the drugs and the drink,

36:05.897 --> 36:07.899
couldn't get clean,
so Max's mum left,

36:07.932 --> 36:11.243
which, I don't know.

36:11.269 --> 36:15.547
Yeah, so I made a lot of money
really quickly, you know?

36:15.573 --> 36:17.644
Met loads of birds
with really big,

36:17.675 --> 36:19.348
nice, juicy milkers.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.551
All that, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.820
Living the high life.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.524
Yeah, and I moved to New York,

36:26.551 --> 36:28.497
set up my own company,
my own label.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.554
That's doing really well,

36:29.587 --> 36:33.399
so, uh, yeah.

36:33.424 --> 36:34.960
I'm just a rich old bastard

36:35.193 --> 36:37.696
with loads of fucking
T-shirts now.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.268
That's it, darling.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.815
- Thank you so much, Mr. Black,
for sharing that with us.

36:46.837 --> 36:49.215
Um, Mr. Coulter,

36:49.240 --> 36:51.220
why don't you-
why don't you share your story

36:51.242 --> 36:52.346
for the students today?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.582
- Right.

36:53.611 --> 36:54.988
Hi.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.387
I'm Mr. Coulter, Derek's dad.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.827
I brought an ATV.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.261
It's parked right out there
by the track.

37:01.285 --> 37:02.286
Anybody want to see it?

37:08.559 --> 37:11.768
All our side-by-sides
have a safety belt, of course,

37:11.796 --> 37:13.673
but they also have a cab net,

37:13.698 --> 37:15.803
and this will keep you snug
in your seat

37:15.833 --> 37:17.437
in the event that you,
you know,

37:17.468 --> 37:19.971
hit a bump
or take a really sharp turn.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.350
Yes, you?
- Are we allowed to drive it?

37:23.374 --> 37:24.717
- I'm afraid I'd need
your parent's signature.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.619
Sorry, though.
Yeah?

37:26.644 --> 37:28.021
- Can Mrs. Pickett drive it?

37:29.013 --> 37:30.822
- That's entirely up to her.
What do you think?

37:30.848 --> 37:31.826
- No, thank you.

37:31.849 --> 37:33.954
I'll leave it
to the professionals.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.965
- I'll do it.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.694
I'll have a go.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.326
- Okay, all you need to know:

37:42.360 --> 37:43.668
gas, brake.
- Gas, brake.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.469
- And emergency brake.

37:45.496 --> 37:46.338
- All right.
- Right?

37:46.364 --> 37:48.310
I'd just-l'd start nice and
easy at first, you know, just...

37:48.332 --> 37:49.640
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Till you get the hang of it.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.044
- Sensible.

37:51.269 --> 37:55.046
- Okay, why don't you ease off
the brake, and-oh!

37:55.273 --> 37:57.275
Okay-
Okay-

37:58.442 --> 37:59.420
Definitely going faster

37:59.443 --> 38:00.581
than I would suggest.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.981

39:07.011 --> 39:08.456
I haven't seen you
since you were, like,

39:08.479 --> 39:10.390
17 or something.

39:10.414 --> 39:11.392
- Uh...

39:11.415 --> 39:13.656
I just finished
a semester at NYU.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.630
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

39:15.653 --> 39:16.825
Then I quit, so...

39:16.854 --> 39:17.855
- Oh, why?

39:18.856 --> 39:20.665
- I don't know;
I just wanted to focus

39:20.691 --> 39:22.534
on music for a while,

39:22.560 --> 39:25.734
like, kind of give that
a year and see what happened.

39:25.763 --> 39:27.674
- Right.

39:27.698 --> 39:28.699
- Yeah, I don't know.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.373
I'm still with that same
band, though, Terrific Liars.

39:31.402 --> 39:32.403
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

39:32.436 --> 39:33.744
- That's been a while, cool.

39:33.771 --> 39:34.875
- Yeah, yeah.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.543
- How's it going?
- It's good, man.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.555
We, uh-we finally
finished our demo.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.022
- That's rad.
- Mm-hmm.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.115
That's actually
one of the reasons

39:42.146 --> 39:43.420
why I came up here,

39:43.447 --> 39:45.085
was so I could show my dad.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.117
See what he thought.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.887
- Yeah, what did he say?

39:48.919 --> 39:49.920
- Oh, nothing yet.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.792
- Why not?

39:52.823 --> 39:54.632
- Well, I haven't
showed it to him.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.433
- Why?

39:56.460 --> 39:59.703
- Because he's Len.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.708
- So?

40:00.731 --> 40:04.508
- So I just know he's gonna
get all weird on me for asking.

40:06.771 --> 40:07.875
What, you think that's dumb?

40:09.573 --> 40:12.179
- No, I don't think it's dumb.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.684
He's a grown man.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.487
I'm sure he can handle his son
asking him to listen to a demo.

40:16.514 --> 40:17.549
- Maybe.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.590
- Plus, Max,
he's, like, your dad.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.155
He has to.

40:56.921 --> 40:57.922
Hello.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.160
- This your vehicle?

41:01.192 --> 41:03.695
- Yep, yeah.

41:03.727 --> 41:06.867
- 'Cause we just got a call
reporting a missing ATV.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.069
Same make and model as this one.

41:10.701 --> 41:13.944
- Right, I'll-
I'll keep me eyes peeled.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.475
- Last seen driven by a guy
wearing an orange helmet.

41:21.645 --> 41:22.783
Should we just take it
back to the shop,

41:22.813 --> 41:24.952
then call it a day?

41:24.982 --> 41:27.189
I have got crimes to fight.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.692
- All right.

41:34.658 --> 41:35.966
I've stolen shit, you know.

41:36.961 --> 41:38.770
- I believe you.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.774
- You know what, I actually
wrote some stuff down,

41:43.801 --> 41:45.576
like, on how I was gonna do it?

41:45.603 --> 41:46.581
- Like notes?

41:46.604 --> 41:47.708
- Yeah, kind of-l mean,

41:47.738 --> 41:49.547
just so I don't
forget anything.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.519
- That is so professional.

41:52.710 --> 41:53.984
- Yeah, I guess.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.116
- So what do your notes
actually say?

41:56.146 --> 41:57.648
- Well...

41:58.682 --> 42:01.288
Dude, we should rehearse.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.293
Are you down?
- Yeah.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.294
- Yeah?
Okay.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.693
I'll be Len, and you be you.
- Okay.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.292
- God, this is totally gonna-

42:06.524 --> 42:08.299
oh, okay, wait.

42:11.562 --> 42:14.168
I'm Len.
Say it to me.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.836
- Are we doing this? All right.
- Mm-hmm.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.870
- Um, so, Dad,
I've been making-

42:18.903 --> 42:20.280
- Bollocks.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.812
- Um, so, Dad-

42:25.843 --> 42:27.686
- Bugger off.
- No, no, stop.

42:29.079 --> 42:32.652
- Here, um...

42:32.683 --> 42:34.629
Dad, I've been make-
- Shit!

42:34.652 --> 42:36.131
- Stop it.
Dad.

42:36.153 --> 42:38.827
All right, Dad-

42:38.856 --> 42:39.834
- Asshole.
- All right.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.263
I'm fucking with you.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.636
You got to harden up.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.639
Go again.
- All right.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.835
Dad, I was-
I've been doing-

42:46.864 --> 42:48.070
- Fuck off.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.042
I fucking miss England.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.204
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

42:50.234 --> 42:53.272
- No one here understands me.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.980
<i>II</i>

42:58.008 --> 42:59.112
<i>- Yeah I</i>

43:01.845 --> 43:03.324
- Fuck off.

43:03.347 --> 43:10.731
<i>II</i>

43:13.624 --> 43:15.331
- So I gave you one,
and then I gave you another one.

43:15.359 --> 43:16.337
- I have it,
and I have this one.

43:17.361 --> 43:18.897
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit, actually-

43:18.929 --> 43:21.307
- Enjoying your spoils?

43:21.332 --> 43:22.743
- Yeah.
He's back!

43:22.766 --> 43:23.744
Both: Where have you been?

43:23.767 --> 43:26.179
- What an absolute shit show.

43:26.203 --> 43:27.307
- What?
- You two, this.

43:28.305 --> 43:29.283
- Dude, calm down.

43:29.306 --> 43:30.842
We made you a plate
if you want some.

43:30.874 --> 43:32.820
- Yeah, I'm a really good cook.
- Yeah.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.083
- Hey, man, you should
know that about me.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.022
I used to cook all the meals
when I was a kid at home.

43:36.046 --> 43:37.047
- Yeah, well, I hope
you haven't been getting

43:37.081 --> 43:38.822
none of that shit on my records.

43:38.849 --> 43:40.795
- Give me a break-the ones
that you don't even listen to?

43:40.818 --> 43:42.297
- Yeah, those ones.

43:43.721 --> 43:44.927
Are you wearing my clothes?

43:50.794 --> 43:52.364
- I'm still mad at you.

43:52.396 --> 43:54.808
- I know.
Shocking.

43:57.968 --> 44:00.209
- Yeah, on national television.

44:00.237 --> 44:01.375
That was so fucked up.

44:01.405 --> 44:02.247
- Yeah, well.

44:02.272 --> 44:05.913
- And the award goes to...

44:05.943 --> 44:09.049
Whoo-hoo.
Everyone's fucking clapping.

44:09.079 --> 44:10.922
Yeah.

44:10.948 --> 44:13.224
And then I walk up on stage,

44:13.250 --> 44:15.093
and Len's following me,

44:15.119 --> 44:19.124
and, oh, where's he going?

44:19.156 --> 44:20.260
Is he fucking leaving?

44:20.290 --> 44:22.668
What's he got to do?

44:22.693 --> 44:26.300
Oops, he forgot
his shiny little statue.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.004
No big-
- I didn't want it.

44:29.033 --> 44:31.240
- You didn't want it?
- No.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.440
- The award for my album?

44:34.672 --> 44:36.015
- No.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.947
- I worked really fucking hard
on that album, Len.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.048
- So did I.

44:42.079 --> 44:43.854
- So why didn't you want it?

44:43.881 --> 44:45.053
- Can't explain it.

44:45.082 --> 44:46.891
- Oh, I think
you can fucking try.

44:46.917 --> 44:47.918
- Look, I don't want
to get into this.

44:47.951 --> 44:50.795
- I drove three fucking hours
to be here, Len,

44:50.821 --> 44:51.822
so, yeah, give it to me.

44:51.855 --> 44:54.165
- It's not something
I want to put out there

44:54.191 --> 44:55.829
in the world, all right?

44:57.027 --> 44:58.301
- Do you mean me?
- Hey, here you go.

44:58.328 --> 45:00.808
_ Hey-
Len?

45:00.831 --> 45:02.401
- Look, can we have this
conversation tomorrow?

45:02.433 --> 45:04.037
- Do you mean me?
- Please? Thank you.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.070
- Oh, of course.
Mm-hmm.

45:06.103 --> 45:07.912
- Thank you.

45:08.939 --> 45:10.009
- You know, I only gave up

45:10.040 --> 45:13.385
my adolescence and my privacy.

45:13.410 --> 45:16.152
Fucking God knows what else,

45:16.180 --> 45:20.253
so you could turn me into
some little singing ATM machine.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.364
I mean, who gives a shit

45:23.387 --> 45:24.991
that no one takes me seriously

45:25.022 --> 45:26.865
and fucking everyone
thinks I'm a joke, right?

45:26.890 --> 45:28.335
- Yeah, and that's 'cause
you get loaded all the time

45:28.358 --> 45:30.065
and take your clothes off,
innit?

45:30.094 --> 45:31.095
- Fuck you.

45:31.128 --> 45:33.074
Whatever, man.

45:33.097 --> 45:34.167
You know, l wouldn't tell him

45:34.198 --> 45:36.109
about your fucking
demo either, Max.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.806
Bullshit.

45:37.835 --> 45:39.041
I mean, are you kidding me?

45:39.069 --> 45:42.141
I've always assumed

45:42.172 --> 45:46.143
that underneath
all the selfish Len shit,

45:46.176 --> 45:49.851
there's actually
a decent human being in there

45:49.880 --> 45:51.086
pulling at the little strings.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.492
There just isn't.

45:55.519 --> 45:56.827
There's not.

45:56.854 --> 45:59.425
You're just full of shit
from head to toe.

45:59.456 --> 46:02.266
Nothing but shit.

46:02.292 --> 46:03.293
- What demo?

46:04.528 --> 46:06.474
- Oh, just the one your son

46:06.497 --> 46:09.000
pretty much quit school to make.
- God.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.170
- You quit school?

46:10.200 --> 46:11.178
- I'm just taking time off.

46:11.201 --> 46:12.077
I was gonna tell you.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.378
But Mom knows.
- Oh, come on.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.247
All he wants

46:16.273 --> 46:19.220
is for you to listen to his demo
for, like, 5 seconds

46:19.243 --> 46:22.053
and actually give
your honest opinion on it,

46:22.079 --> 46:24.025
and he's too scared to ask you,

46:24.047 --> 46:25.890
'cause he knows you're just
gonna be an asshole about it.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.486
Fucking asshole-
- Okay, I did not-

46:27.518 --> 46:29.020
I didn't say asshole.
That's not-

46:29.052 --> 46:30.122
- Why are you
apologizing to him?

46:30.154 --> 46:32.566
He's the one
that owes you an apology.

46:32.790 --> 46:33.894
This is bullshit.
You should be-

46:33.924 --> 46:36.837
- Put a fucking sock
in it, Zoe.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.898
Jesus Christ, girl.

46:39.930 --> 46:42.274
Fucking hell.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.211
Fucking pain in the ass.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.511
- Yeah, of course I am.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.188
You want to make a cheers?
- Oh, God.

47:02.019 --> 47:04.499
- Cheers to deadbeat dads.

47:07.057 --> 47:08.900
And you are an asshole.

47:08.926 --> 47:11.839
He might not tell you, but I am.

47:11.862 --> 47:14.536
Fuckin' sweet dreams, Len.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.442
Whoo.

47:16.466 --> 47:18.309
Fucking dick.

47:18.335 --> 47:19.575
You suck.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.111
- She can fucking cook,
I'll give her that.

47:34.585 --> 47:42.595
<i>II</i>

48:01.645 --> 48:09.655
<i>II</i>

48:48.392 --> 48:50.372
- William,
are you following me?

48:56.166 --> 48:58.043
I can see you.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.575
You're hiding behind
that little shit of a tree.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.016
You've got a green jacket.

49:04.041 --> 49:05.987
I can smell your Pop-Tart.

49:10.981 --> 49:13.222
- I just came by to see
if you needed anything.

49:13.250 --> 49:14.957
I don't have class till later.

49:16.186 --> 49:17.563
What are you doing?

49:17.587 --> 49:19.965
- Burying some cables.

49:19.990 --> 49:21.094
- Why?

49:21.124 --> 49:23.126
- So I don't record anything.

49:25.128 --> 49:26.664
Care to assist me?

49:28.131 --> 49:29.109
- Sure.

49:29.132 --> 49:33.012

49:33.036 --> 49:35.448
We only have the one shovel, but
we could take turns digging.

49:35.472 --> 49:37.213
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.277
I'll go first,
since, uh, you carried that,

49:39.309 --> 49:41.550
and you're probably tired.

49:41.578 --> 49:43.216
- Smart.

49:43.246 --> 49:51.256

49:52.389 --> 49:54.699
People are hungry animals,
William.

49:57.127 --> 49:59.129
They want things.

50:04.501 --> 50:06.606
And they'll chew through you
to get them.

50:12.609 --> 50:13.587
. <i>HEY-</i>

50:13.610 --> 50:15.647
I behaved like a ginormous
asshole last night.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.283
- It's no big deal.

51:28.852 --> 51:30.297
- I really like it.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.857
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.398
It's awesome.

51:41.465 --> 51:43.342
Now you should totally
let the asshole

51:43.366 --> 51:44.344
listen to it.

51:46.436 --> 51:47.676
- Yeah, yeah.

51:47.704 --> 51:50.446
- Oh, come on.
Be a little braver.

51:50.474 --> 51:52.317
- He would not get it at all.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.585
- Come on, Max.
He might.

51:55.612 --> 51:58.616
- Hm.
- Don't be scared of him.

51:58.648 --> 52:01.185
You're the artist.
He's just a fucking producer.

52:42.526 --> 52:44.802

52:44.828 --> 52:47.206
- Full of dead bastards,
I'd imagine.

52:47.230 --> 52:49.335
- You're in it.

52:49.366 --> 52:51.368
- Just bastards, then.

52:52.903 --> 52:53.847
What're you working on?

52:53.870 --> 52:56.282
- Just some writing.

52:56.306 --> 52:57.546
- What sort?

52:57.574 --> 52:59.178
- Kind of private.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.449
- What, as in "Dear Diary,
Max here.

53:00.477 --> 53:01.478
I'm sick as a parrot."
- No.

53:01.511 --> 53:02.854
- Not really-
- Let's have a look.

53:02.879 --> 53:04.825
- Hey, wait.
Hey.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.521
- Oh, ho-ho.
Let's have a look.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.496
Right.
"Notes for demo conversation."

53:08.518 --> 53:09.622
- Give it back.

53:09.653 --> 53:12.395
- "Number one, targeting
and approaching labels.

53:12.422 --> 53:14.925
Number two, Facebook,
Twitter, dedicated url."

53:14.958 --> 53:17.666
What the fuck is "url"?
- It's URL.

53:17.694 --> 53:18.672
It's our fucking website.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.834
- Right, very savvy.
"Number <i>3,</i> word of mouth-"

53:20.864 --> 53:23.401
- Look, did you come
in here for a reason?

53:23.433 --> 53:24.776
Or are you just
bored and looking

53:24.801 --> 53:26.474
for somebody to fuck with?

53:27.704 --> 53:29.684
- I'm...

53:32.242 --> 53:34.222
I'm a very successful
producer, Max.

53:34.244 --> 53:35.222
I know that.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:35.245 --> 53:37.350
You're the amazing Len Black.
Everybody agrees.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.860
- I'm not talking about me.
I'm trying to talk about you.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.362
- Clearly.

53:47.657 --> 53:49.500
- You know you've led
a very privileged life.

53:49.526 --> 53:51.972
It's not your fault,
but you have.

53:51.995 --> 53:53.338
Good schools,

53:53.363 --> 53:55.434
teachers telling you
you can be what you want to be:

53:55.465 --> 53:56.808
a doctor,

53:56.833 --> 53:58.335
an astronaut, an artist.

53:59.936 --> 54:01.244
You know, and you're
a good kid.

54:01.271 --> 54:02.306
You are.
You always have been.

54:02.339 --> 54:03.784
Your whole...

54:03.807 --> 54:06.287
temperament,
your composition is balanced.

54:06.309 --> 54:08.255
It's-it's careful.

54:10.547 --> 54:11.992
You're like a diet drink.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.422
The danger's been taken out
of your formula, Max.

54:16.453 --> 54:17.454
You're like a...

54:18.989 --> 54:20.366
Diet Dr Pepper.

54:20.390 --> 54:21.869
- Mmm, that's
Diet Dr Pepper-

54:21.891 --> 54:23.632
- That's what you're like, Max.

54:23.660 --> 54:25.435
- What?

54:25.462 --> 54:27.373
- But real rock, real...

54:27.397 --> 54:30.435
rock and roll music
isn't a diet drink, mate.

54:30.467 --> 54:33.607
It's a cocktail of...

54:33.637 --> 54:35.378
blood and bourbon and napalm.

54:35.405 --> 54:37.510
It's heat and emotion
and intensity.

54:37.540 --> 54:40.453
It's-it's channeling
the beast from within.

54:40.477 --> 54:41.956
It's not sitting around
with your mates,

54:41.978 --> 54:44.515
making some form of fucking
ironic commentary, Max.

54:44.547 --> 54:46.720
It's religious.
It's more than religion.

54:47.751 --> 54:50.027
It's-it's biological.

54:52.322 --> 54:53.824
So there's no point in you

54:53.857 --> 54:56.064
shoehorning yourself
into something

54:56.293 --> 54:57.966
if in the long run,
that's all it is.

54:57.994 --> 54:59.940
Not in your nature.

55:01.531 --> 55:03.807
Or-or...

55:03.833 --> 55:05.540
contrived might be
a better way of putting it.

55:05.568 --> 55:07.605
- Contrived?
- Unnatural.

55:10.407 --> 55:13.081
- Is-is that it?

55:13.310 --> 55:15.551
Is that your whole-

55:15.578 --> 55:18.388
- Apparently, you
wanted my opinion.

55:18.415 --> 55:20.361
- Well, did you listen
to my demo?

55:21.618 --> 55:23.655
- No.

55:23.687 --> 55:25.963
- Yeah, so, that's really not
your opinion, then, at all.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.491
That's just you ranting.

55:27.524 --> 55:28.832
- I'm trying
to be helpful, Max.

55:28.858 --> 55:29.768
- Diet Dr Pepper?

55:29.793 --> 55:32.034
- Jesus Christ,
that's a metaphor.

55:33.029 --> 55:35.600
- I just-l wanted you
to do one thing,

55:35.632 --> 55:37.703
and that's listen
to my 20-minute demo

55:37.734 --> 55:39.077
and give me your opinion on it,

55:39.102 --> 55:41.446
but you couldn't do that.

55:41.471 --> 55:42.449
You call me spoiled,

55:42.472 --> 55:44.975
and you compare me
to some drink.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.988
Do you want to know
something funny, though?

55:47.010 --> 55:49.752
It's that my-my friends
always ask me,

55:49.779 --> 55:52.658
like, "ls your dad really
that much of an asshole?"

55:52.682 --> 55:53.820
And I always tell them, like,

55:53.850 --> 55:55.056
"No, it's just exaggeration,

55:55.085 --> 55:57.065
but he's pretty harmless."

55:57.087 --> 55:59.089
Well, guess what.
I've got a new answer now.

56:02.125 --> 56:04.537
That he really is
that much of an asshole.

56:53.676 --> 56:56.020
- It's a monarch butterfly
way station.

56:56.045 --> 56:57.786
They're going extinct
from lack of milkweed,

56:57.814 --> 57:00.055
so we planted a patch.

57:02.619 --> 57:04.860
Hopefully, they'll come through
in May or June.

57:06.990 --> 57:08.628
- Len's saving butterflies?

57:09.759 --> 57:11.761

- I can't remember
the rest of it.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.553

you've got, like,

59:10.580 --> 59:13.720
<i>50 pounds of mud on you, fight'?</i>

59:13.750 --> 59:15.787
- Yeah, my associate,
William, and I decided

59:15.818 --> 59:18.594
to bury some enemies
in the wood.

59:18.621 --> 59:21.124
- Uh-oh.
Is that a warning of some kind?

59:21.157 --> 59:22.295
- Yeah, sort of.

59:23.626 --> 59:26.163
Oh, should Max and I
be nervous?

59:28.031 --> 59:29.601

you're lucky that we're here.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.318
- And Max?

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.328
- Yeah, no, he's fine.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.922
He's at the hospital
with her now.

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:46.456
. Okay"

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:52.937
What the hell
is going on up here?

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.272
- Tell me about it.

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:56.368
First of all, he shows up

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:59.403
with his puppy-dog eyes
and his bag,

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:01.415
and then the fucking
glitter monster

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:04.611
rolls into town,
digging her claws into my back.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.549
- The "he" in your story,
that's Max?

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.920
Your son?

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.960
- I came up here
to be alone, Bella,

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.621
you know?

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.263
I need to know what
I'm doing with me life.

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.061
I can't have them here.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.898
- You're joking, right?

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:26.965
- I miss you, Bella.
- Oh, fuck off.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.003
- How's Russell?

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.273
- He's great.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:34.144
- Spineless troll.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.205
- I'll send him your love.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.413
So that's it?

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.183
You're being inconvenienced?

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.451
That's what that
dire message was all about?

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.455
Not enough time to think about
yourself as you'd like?

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.996
- What's more important
in life than two people

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.931
who were meant to be together?

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:55.664
- Max.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.898
- I hear he quit school.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.242
- Yeah, he wanted to tell you.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.645
I tried to convince him
to at least finish out the year,

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:09.047
but he was adamant.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.516
He sounded like you, actually.

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.143
- Doubt it.

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:13.152
- Why?

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.586
- Dropping out of university

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.680
and living off your parents

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.051
so you can finger-paint
with your trust fund mates

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.684
wasn't exactly my circumstance.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.452
- Oh, barf.
- It's true.

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:26.626
- What did you think of it,
by the way?

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.636
- Think of what?

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:29.659
- His demo.

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.535
- I haven't listened to it.

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.974
- Why not?

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.171
- I don't know.
I just haven't.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.578
- Why haven't you
listened to it?

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.140
- I'm taking time out, Bella.

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.709
- From what? From being
a decent human being?

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.584
- What if it's bad'?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.251
- Then it's bad.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.351
- I don't want to be
the one to tell him that.

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.123
- Well, then don't.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.688
Make something up.
That's what you do.

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:04.570
- It's-it's different.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.004
It's hipster music.

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.006
- I fucking hate hipster music.

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.600
- Who gives a rat's ass
what you hate?

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.169
Are you kidding me?
You haven't listened to it?

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.078
- No.
- Oh, you are crazy.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.081
Do you know that?

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.482
I can't believe we're even
having this conversation.

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.118
How do you do that?

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:24.053
How do you just tune out
everything else around you?

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.024
- I miss you, Bella.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.552
- Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.523
- Leave the troll.

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.536
Let's get a place in Norway,
you know?

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.367
Live off the land,

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.634

- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.115
- Hey.
- How's the patient?

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.524
- She's all right, yeah.
- Okay.

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:02.290
- She's just-she'll be
released this afternoon.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:06.494
- Mm.
- Yeah, it's just...

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.399
Can you believe someone at-
someone at the hospital

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:09.767
called TMZ or something?

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.466
- TMZ.
Jesus Christ.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.406
- It's a big part
of your demographic.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.500
- Yeah.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:20.043
Hey, do you want
to get some lunch?

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.776
- Sure, what about-
do you think that diner's

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.147
still open on Franklin?

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.278
- No, yeah.
It's exactly the same, yeah.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.117
- Should we invite your father?

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.282
- Don't know.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.120
You decide.

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:34.287
- It's up to you.
- Nah, you pick.

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.522
- Well, we just had a walk,
so I'm good.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.393
- All right.

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:39.366
- Yeah, l-l've got to see

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.368
to that raccoon anyway.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.801
- So am I riding with you?

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:45.533
- No, I have to take my car,
pick up Zoe after.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.562
. Okay"

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.473
- Right, okay.

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.637
Well, I'll-l'll see you both
later, then, yes, right?

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.237
- Well, I got to
get back to the city.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.543
. Okay"

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.106
- Yeah, and I think
I'm gonna go home after too.

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.776
- Right.

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:58.785
- Yeah.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.845
- Yeah, l-l've got
to sort that raccoon out

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.613
or, you know...

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.153
- Yeah.

- Thanks for the walk.

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:16.330
Okay.

What are you gonna get?

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:18.701
- I don't know.
- Let me guess.

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.434
You're gonna get a Cobb salad.

01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:22.698
- With some blue cheese.

- I'm cleaning the pool.

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.683
- What happened
to all the vegetation?

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:07.310
- Vegetation?

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:09.888
- What's that?

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:12.413
- Chemicals.

- Yes.

Whatever was making it natural.

dead mosquitoes.

Jesus Christ, William,

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.911
I didn't ask you to do this.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.743
- I was just
taking the initiative.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.715
- Well, it's a terrible idea.

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:39.346

back in if you want.

- No, look-look-
look, why don't you just

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.455
go home for the day?

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:44.750
. Okay"

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.685
You know,
I could do some research

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.218
and find out how
to make it green again.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.752
- No, it's all right.
It's fine, okay?

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.697
Just...

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:56.936
Maybe you should take
a break from all this.

You know, not come round
as often.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.605
Find some friends

You wouldn't
recognize these from anywhere...

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.098

I just enjoy
the process, really.

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:46.225
And I've kept my day job,

I teach in Sullivan County.

to be the sub at your school?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.707
- No, my old man was in prison

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:09.113

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.583

- Wow, that's weird.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.320
You didn't have to call
the ambulance, by the way.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.651
I would have been fine.

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:26.148
- No of fence, but you
really didn't seem fine.

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.888
- Well, I've been like that,
like, a million times,

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.725
so it's not a big deal.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:33.699
- Well, maybe you should
be more careful.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.793
- You're good, Max.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.772
- Oh, God.
Please don't say that.

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.830
- Why?

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.205
- Because-
- What's wrong with that?

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.766
It's, like, a nice thing to say.

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.335
Good's good.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.112
It's a compliment.

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:01.922
- This is gonna make me
seem even more good

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.623
or naive or whatever,

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.654
but, like, I just-

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.792
I like you a whole lot better

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.632
when you're not all,
like, high and messed up.

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.931
And, like, I know it's a part
of your whole thing,

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.032
and I get that, but...

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:17.977
I don't know;
I just wanted to tell you,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.708
because I'm guessing
a lot of people around you

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.046
don't tell you the truth.

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:28.785
- It's not naive.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:41.156
- All right, William.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.326
. <i>HEY-</i>

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.163
What are you doing here?

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.399
- Looking for you.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.738
Your dad...

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.374
said you'd be back soon.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.120
So I sat inside
with him for a bit.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.950
- Your car's still running.

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:08.928
- The battery will die
if I switch it off.

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.119
- Oh.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.398
- I'm sorry for what I said.

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.461
I didn't mean it.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:18.694
I was a shit.

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.201
None of what happened
was your fault.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.107
That's why I'm here.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.848
Your contribution is crucial
to the daily functioning

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:33.875
of Black Enterprises.

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.814
And whilst I do think
you're wasting your life

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:41.919
hanging out
with the likes of me,

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:44.021
I need your help.

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.496
- Can we make business cards?

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:53.864
Definitely.

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:57.777
- Can I be vice president?

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.040
- His Honor,
the Right Reverend

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.014
Vice President William Prenger.

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.038
How's that?

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.350
- All right.

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:10.923
- Your shiner's getting better.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.520
- It was that kid, Derek.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.492
He's the one that hit me.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.863
I don't really get along
with him or his friends.

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.993
- I remember him.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:24.904
He seemed like a bit of a cunt.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:30.336
Everyone in school's a cunt.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.242
- Tell me about it.

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.007
Imagine having to
teach them calculus.

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:41.147
- You must have been
a very bad man

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:43.247
in a former life, Mr. Prenger.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.122
- I think that
thought every day.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.921
- Right, well,
I'd better shoo off

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:53.330
before me car blows up.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.333
See you, William.

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:56.962
Thanks for the tea, Mr. Prenger.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.101
- See you tomorrow, Len.
- See ya.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:14.278
<i>II</i>

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.030
. <i>HEY-</i>

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:39.434
- You look rank.

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.040
You all right?

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:48.020
- Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.386
- Well, people don't want
to see you dead.

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:51.322
They like you better alive.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.554
Not everyone.
Most people.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:58.226
- <i>So you Won?</i>

01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.561
<i>- Yes, of course!</i>

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.966
<i>We won.
We won!</i>

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.901
<i>Victory!</i>

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.461
- I'd have thought
you'd have shot off by now.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:07.200
- I'm kind of tired.

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:09.106
It cool if I stay the night?

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.110
- You can stay
as long as you like.

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.475
- All right.

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:15.877
- Three cheers...

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:18.282
- All right, well, uh...

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:22.311
don't-don't go
without saying anything.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.415
- Oh, I won't.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.086
- <i>All</i> We <i>need now
is for King Richard to be here,</i>

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:30.153
<i>and the day shall be complete.</i>

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.550
- <i>The dry creek bed
made for better footing,</i>

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.222
<i>but it left the man exposed.</i>

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:05.162
<i>He moved as quickly
as he could,</i>

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:07.188
<i>not bothering
to cover his tracks.</i>

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.601
<i>Low clouds were moving in
behind the peaks,</i>

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:13.105
<i>and he knew
the snow would come</i> soon.

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:16.575
<i>It was another hour
to the pass, maybe more.</i>

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.272
<i>The pain in his leg was gone
now, but he still walked</i>

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:22.009
<i>with his hand
against the crusted wound.</i>

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.607
<i>Ahead of him,
the creek widened</i>

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.276
<i>as it came
into flatter ground.</i>

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:30.386
<i>- So, farewell, Edna.</i>

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:32.414
<i>You'll be seeing me later.</i>

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.588
<i>- Have-have, uh-</i>

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.227
<i>have you got transport'?</i>

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.361
- Are you okay?

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.098
- Yeah.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:46.104
- <i>Borrow my horse again,
or at all.</i>

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.129
<i>I mean, not that you've
borrowed it before.</i>

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:50.976
- <i>Coming.</i>

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.502
- Do you want to
kiss me right now?

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.639
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:56.706
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.718
- Yeah.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.515
- <i>The prospector hung
from a tree</i>

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:03.148
<i>about 20 paces from the horse.</i>

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:06.489
<i>His boots stood side by side
at the foot of his bedroll,</i>

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:09.085
<i>and his pack leaned
against the saddle.</i>

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.597
<i>They'd come upon him
in his sheep.</i>

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.758
<i>The untethered horse watched
as the man kicked</i>

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:17.027
<i>the ashes of the fire,
embers still glowing.</i>

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:26.569
- <i>Hold!</i>

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.547
<i>You dare sit there, boy'?</i>

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.174
<i>Thai was King Richards seat.</i>

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.344
- He stood <i>below</i> the prospector,

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:35.753
<i>Whose stiff body twisted
slowly in the cold Wind.</i>

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:38.189
<i>The prospector's dead,
staring eyes</i>

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:41.126
<i>gave the impression that he was
scanning the horizon,</i>

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:43.026
<i>looking for something.</i>

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.395
<i>The man walked
towards the saddle,</i>

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.660
<i>moving slowly,</i>

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.497
<i>not Wanting the horse to bolt.</i>

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.093
<i>He felt the blow to his neck</i>

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:53.106
<i>before he heard the gunshot.</i>

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:55.267
<i>The ground rose quickly
to his face,</i>

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:57.503
<i>and then he saw nothing.</i>

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:01.571
<i>He could feel the warm blood
pooling under his chest.</i>

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.378
<i>A kick to his ribs,</i>

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:06.284
<i>but with H, no pain.</i>

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:09.481
<i>His last breaths
feed a familiar vision."</i>

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.548
a White Wooden house

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:14.355
<i>surrounded by green fields.</i>

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.692
<i>A woman on the porch,</i>

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.391
<i>shaking a dusty rug.</i>

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.660
<i>In front of the house,</i>

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:22.759
<i>a boy chases a dog.</i>

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:26.534
<i>The Woman snaps the rug.
The rug coughs obediently.</i>

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:29.371
<i>The dog turns and barks.</i>

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:30.637
<i>The boy and the dog</i>

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:32.611
<i>run toward the man.</i>

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.204
<i>These are the things
that have kept him</i>

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:37.114
<i>moving forward
these ten months.</i>

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.140
<i>The woman and the rug,</i>

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.676

. <i>HEY-</i>

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:41.597
Is that mine?

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:45.233
- Yeah, I found it
in the kitchen.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.745
- Oh.

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.240
You don't
have to say anything.

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.843
But how far did you get?

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.357
- Just finished
me second listen.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:04.597
There's a lot of static on it.

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:06.530
- Yeah, well, we recorded it
on this old, like,

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.692
Sony tape recorder.

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.231
And we had to transfer it to MP3

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:14.399
with this, like,
really old music software

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:16.272
that we found, so...

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:19.505
- That plucking,
is that Gravikord?

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.946
- No, it's-it's
an actual real kora.

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.244
Yeah.

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:25.751
Zach brought it back from
his, like, trip to West Africa.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.309
- Well, that's a beautiful
instrument.

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:29.288
- Yeah.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.846
- Built in bass, you know,

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.755
good for syncopation.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.386
- Yeah, you-you really don't
have to pretend to like it.

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.829
- Well, me liking it's
irrelevant.

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:47.302
You know, I've never been
much of a talker...

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:49.274
or a hugger.

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:54.279
I've probably never
told you the things...

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.407
a dad should tell you.

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:00.642
- It's okay.

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.749
- No, it's not.

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.300
Here.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.769
- So you coming
to the city anytime soon?

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:26.438
- Don't know.
I haven't made any real plans.

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.606
- Yeah, I haven't really
made any plans either.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.341
- Being a dropout and all.
- Yeah.

<i>II</i>

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.952
- Well, that's okay.
You're young.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.457
You're not supposed to.

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.853
- Well, if you're around,
let me know.

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.799
We'll go to, like, a-a show
or, I don't know, watch

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:48.800
a Liverpool game or something.

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.767
- Will do.
- All right.
