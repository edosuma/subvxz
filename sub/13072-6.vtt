WEBVTT

00:00.387 --> 00:02.387
Previously on Guilt.

00:02.452 --> 00:03.751
The luminol tests show blood.

00:03.786 --> 00:06.522
We found trace amounts on the
American girl's feet.

00:06.557 --> 00:07.721
Your coppers, they really

00:07.758 --> 00:09.525
screwed the pooch on this one.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.727
You and I both know that this
will not hold up in court.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.327
I want it dropped.

00:13.364 --> 00:14.398
 We've got 22 hours

00:14.433 --> 00:15.621
to get Luc Pascal to talk.

00:15.647 --> 00:17.423
This is my cousin, Kevin McGee.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.393
Nice to meet you, mate.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.368
Molly's brother broke
into Finch's office.

00:20.403 --> 00:21.736
He stole the client ledger!

00:21.804 --> 00:22.803
Finch is on a war path.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.541
He's going to hunt us down
and kill us both!

00:25.576 --> 00:26.507
Are you lying to me?

00:26.544 --> 00:28.410
What are you...

00:28.445 --> 00:29.344
Did they...

00:29.379 --> 00:31.413
ask you anything about that night?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.347
I wouldn't say anything if they did.

00:33.384 --> 00:34.549
No one will ever know.

00:34.585 --> 00:36.350
It's our secret.

01:03.479 --> 01:04.513
Mr. Finch.

01:04.548 --> 01:05.713
What are you doing here?

01:05.748 --> 01:07.549
I've got a little something to show you.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.352
Oh, my God!

01:11.655 --> 01:13.454
Now, Colin here claims he doesn't know

01:13.489 --> 01:15.557
the name of the chap
you were shagging in the club.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.694
The one who stole my ledger.

01:20.597 --> 01:22.730
It's unfortunate.

01:28.405 --> 01:29.537
Look at the mess you've made, huh?

01:29.573 --> 01:32.473
And all over my favorite jacket.

01:34.645 --> 01:36.478
You got anything to say
for yourself, hmm?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.813
Bit of mea culpa?

01:39.415 --> 01:40.748
Find me that ledger.

01:40.783 --> 01:43.484
Or you'll be next.

02:29.432 --> 02:30.598
I'll be right back.

02:52.526 --> 02:54.088
When am I getting out of here?

02:54.562 --> 02:56.088
We're working on that.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.308
But there's a separate matter
that I wish to discuss.

02:59.853 --> 03:01.366
Molly Ryan's murder.

03:02.901 --> 03:04.163
I'm not talking about anything

03:04.198 --> 03:06.305
- without Stan Gutterie.
- If he comes in here,

03:06.341 --> 03:08.507
he will do anything it takes to
make sure that Grace goes free.

03:08.543 --> 03:11.276
And if that means you take
the fall for Molly's murder,

03:11.312 --> 03:12.311
then so be it.

03:15.449 --> 03:17.111
You know what?
I'll be completely honest...

03:17.518 --> 03:18.879
this whole time...

03:19.353 --> 03:21.687
I suspected that Grace had killed Molly.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.223
But I spent the day

03:24.259 --> 03:25.524
going over every shred of evidence.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.360
I even called in a blood spatter expert

03:27.395 --> 03:30.025
to take a closer look,
and do you know what I found?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.366
Turns out I had it all wrong.

03:37.305 --> 03:39.538
The blood spatter pictures...

03:39.574 --> 03:42.341
clearly show that there were
two people in the room

03:42.377 --> 03:43.475
when Molly died.

03:45.945 --> 03:48.711
You... and Grace.

03:49.516 --> 03:51.550
You killed Molly Ryan together.

03:56.788 --> 03:57.622
That was Stan.

03:57.658 --> 03:59.358
His source at Scotland Yard said

03:59.394 --> 04:01.426
the Crown Prosecutor is
interrogating Luc again.

04:02.027 --> 04:03.093
About the murder.

04:05.365 --> 04:06.431
Why?

04:06.467 --> 04:08.300
I thought he got arrested for drugs.

04:08.336 --> 04:11.203
My best guess is they're trying
to use him to get to you.

04:11.239 --> 04:12.346
- Can't Stan do something?
- He's on his way there now.

04:12.371 --> 04:14.688
He's gonna try to shut it down.

04:14.723 --> 04:16.351
- Right, but what if he can't?
- Grace...

04:16.387 --> 04:19.377
You know that prosecutor's had
it in for me this whole time.

04:22.952 --> 04:25.216
It doesn't matter what the truth is.

04:25.252 --> 04:29.521
She'll twist Luc's words,
do anything to get me.

04:30.332 --> 04:31.356
We won't let her.

04:31.391 --> 04:32.490
I'll call Bruno.

04:40.024 --> 04:41.399
How'd it go with the press?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.369
It's all a blur.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.372
I tried to sound smart,
but not too intellectual.

04:46.406 --> 04:47.375
Mm-hmm.

04:47.411 --> 04:49.307
Thoughtful without being snooty,

04:49.343 --> 04:52.310
and approachable without
sounding flighty.

04:54.348 --> 04:56.382
I was terrified I'd give
the wrong answer.

04:56.417 --> 04:58.492
My "A" levels were a joke in comparison.

05:02.589 --> 05:04.514
Welcome to the royal fishbowl.

05:05.225 --> 05:07.000
Every second of my life has been
documented and scrutinized,

05:07.035 --> 05:09.726
from spitting up on my mum
during my christening,

05:09.762 --> 05:11.793
through every hideously
awkward moment of puberty.

05:12.795 --> 05:14.233
It was relentless.

05:14.867 --> 05:15.600
I'm just...

05:15.908 --> 05:18.843
grateful that you are willing to
put up with all the intrusions.

05:19.307 --> 05:21.574
Theo, I'll do silly press
events every day

05:21.608 --> 05:24.187
if it means being with you
for the rest of my life.

05:32.387 --> 05:33.959
I can't spare you the spotlight.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.221
But I can offer one piece of advice

05:36.257 --> 05:37.322
that might make it more tolerable.

05:37.358 --> 05:38.576
Mm-hmm?

05:39.459 --> 05:41.226
Find one thing that's yours.

05:41.262 --> 05:43.326
Something that nobody else
can take from you.

05:44.298 --> 05:46.365
Something that's your secret.

05:48.603 --> 05:49.742
Okay.

05:50.057 --> 05:51.168
I can do that.

05:52.305 --> 05:53.406
What's your secret thing?

05:57.656 --> 05:58.610
If I told you that,

05:58.646 --> 06:00.312
it wouldn't be mine anymore, would it?

06:14.262 --> 06:16.788
- Hello?
- Gwen's got Luc back in the box.

06:16.814 --> 06:19.497
She's trying to get him to turn
on Grace, I know it.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.500
- Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.
- She set Luc up,

06:21.536 --> 06:23.536
didn't she? That whole drug
arrest was just a way

06:23.571 --> 06:25.850
for her to squeeze him
until he buries Grace.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.505
I, uh, I...

06:27.542 --> 06:29.542
I mean, I have no idea
about Gwen's strategy.

06:29.576 --> 06:32.838
Can you go down there, try to
find out what he's saying?

06:33.665 --> 06:34.411
Natalie...

06:34.531 --> 06:36.545
I know it's a lot to ask, I'm just...

06:36.581 --> 06:38.992
trying to protect my sister.

06:39.752 --> 06:41.483
I'm off the case, you know that.

06:41.519 --> 06:42.685
You could talk to Pike.

06:43.048 --> 06:44.553
He knows what's going on.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.488
I've crossed too many lines with
you already, Natalie.

06:46.524 --> 06:47.591
We shouldn't even be talking about this.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.425
I get that. I'm just..

06:49.461 --> 06:51.661
I'm gonna hang up on you now.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:51.697 --> 06:52.795
Alex, I...

06:58.670 --> 07:00.637
They're after me and Luc
for Molly's murder.

07:00.672 --> 07:02.605
They set Luc up with the drugs,
and I'm next.

07:07.646 --> 07:08.644
What?

07:09.781 --> 07:11.648
- What is it?
- I can't.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.750
- It's too dangerous. I can't.
- Roz,

07:13.785 --> 07:16.319
I'm going down for this. If...

07:16.355 --> 07:17.387
if you know anything...

07:17.422 --> 07:18.528
I messed up.

07:19.018 --> 07:20.250
I messed up big.

07:23.362 --> 07:24.461
After we found Molly...

07:26.632 --> 07:27.730
...I panicked.

07:27.766 --> 07:28.999
I nicked her phone.

07:29.261 --> 07:31.394
What? Are you crazy?

07:31.569 --> 07:33.858
The Courtenay's all over that thing.

07:34.908 --> 07:36.572
It will look bad for me and Molly.

07:36.608 --> 07:38.441
If the police found out, I...

07:38.476 --> 07:39.742
So you were saving your own skin.

07:39.778 --> 07:41.941
I would've said something sooner, but...

07:42.613 --> 07:43.812
since Molly died, Grace,

07:43.848 --> 07:45.451
I've been so scared.

07:45.783 --> 07:48.141
Afraid that if I say something...

07:49.553 --> 07:50.754
What is going on, Roz?

07:52.403 --> 07:53.913
I looked through her phone...

07:54.941 --> 07:55.752
and...

07:56.427 --> 07:58.430
and there were these threatening texts.

07:58.797 --> 08:00.362
What do they say?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.182
That he was gonna slit her throat.

08:06.711 --> 08:07.670
Who?

08:07.706 --> 08:09.197
Who said that?

08:14.579 --> 08:16.396
- Finch?
- Yeah.

08:17.175 --> 08:19.417
I think the bastard killed Molly.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.350
Why didn't you tell the police?

08:30.297 --> 08:31.975
He's got the coppers all in his pocket.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.777
I know for a fact

08:33.812 --> 08:36.423
Lieutenant Commissioner Wesson
is a Courtenay regular,

08:36.458 --> 08:39.297
as well as half of the judges
in the bloody city.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.168
Finch will find out.

08:41.754 --> 08:42.885
And he'll kill me.

08:46.537 --> 08:47.790
Where's the phone now?

08:48.504 --> 08:49.894
It's in my bag.

08:49.928 --> 08:52.062
I shut it down while we
were still at the flat.

08:52.097 --> 08:54.030
I couldn't risk the coppers
tracing it to me.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.768
The police have to see it.
Once they see those texts,

08:56.803 --> 08:59.003
they'll realize Finch killed Molly.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.738
We hand in that phone,

09:00.773 --> 09:02.840
it'll never see the light of day.

09:07.779 --> 09:08.879
We don't hand it in.

09:10.649 --> 09:12.649
We plant it on Finch and turn it on.

09:12.947 --> 09:13.750
Tonight.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.921
The cops will be all over him
in a heartbeat.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.875
Well, how do we plant it?

09:19.677 --> 09:21.658
If one of us starts cozying up to Finch,

09:21.693 --> 09:23.927
he'll definitely know something's dodgy.

09:25.572 --> 09:27.125
That's why we need someone else.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.000
Someone Finch doesn't know.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.770
- Like who?
- Like my sister.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.806
She's a bloody prosecutor.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.008
As if she's gonna plant evidence?

09:38.043 --> 09:40.811
She doesn't have to know
that's what we're doing.

09:49.087 --> 09:50.888
Patrick!

09:52.584 --> 09:54.254
Patrick! Hello?

09:55.126 --> 09:56.092
Patrick...

09:56.128 --> 09:57.695
It's Kaley, let me in.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.664
Oh, my God. Kaley!

10:02.868 --> 10:04.100
You have to help me.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.035
What happened? A-Are you hurt?

10:06.072 --> 10:08.806
He shot him and there was blood,
like, everywhere.

10:12.283 --> 10:14.250
It's okay, you're all right.

10:16.014 --> 10:17.880
You're safe now.

10:17.917 --> 10:18.948
Shh, shh.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.071
Hey.

10:24.365 --> 10:25.528
Who shot who?

10:26.296 --> 10:27.345
Finch.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.961
He shot that man who
brought you into the club.

10:36.101 --> 10:38.499
He knows you have the ledger, Patrick.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.038
You have to give it back.

10:41.462 --> 10:43.072
Okay? Or else he's gonna kill us both.

10:46.044 --> 10:47.811
Come on, Luc.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.059
You're an artist.

10:49.688 --> 10:51.782
You know every picture tells a story.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.784
The more I look at these,
the more details I can fill in.

10:55.888 --> 10:56.986
See this void.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.863
Clearly shows two people were there.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.601
The blood hit the
person instead of the floor.

11:00.636 --> 11:01.374
That's how I know,

11:01.409 --> 11:03.461
for certain, that there were
two people in that room.

11:03.495 --> 11:06.409
Told you this a hundred times
already: I didn't kill Molly.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.631
But you were there, weren't you?

11:09.652 --> 11:10.091
No...

11:10.116 --> 11:11.701
You were there, you were in
that room, weren't you?

11:11.736 --> 11:13.736
You were a witness.
You walked in on Grace

11:13.773 --> 11:15.663
- No...
- stabbing Molly, your friend.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.975
And now you're staying quiet
to protect her.

11:18.009 --> 11:20.755
Look, if Grace killed Molly,
I wouldn't lie to protect her.

11:20.792 --> 11:21.687
Really?

11:21.711 --> 11:24.014
Because that's what you think
love is, don't you?

11:25.596 --> 11:26.830
Lying for someone,

11:27.019 --> 11:28.543
keeping their secrets.

11:29.963 --> 11:31.009
You did it with your mother,

11:31.044 --> 11:32.345
now you're doing it with Grace.

11:32.711 --> 11:34.691
My mother has nothing to do with this.

11:34.726 --> 11:35.875
She left you alone.

11:36.761 --> 11:39.456
For almost a week, wasn't it?
You were just eight.

11:39.491 --> 11:43.289
No food, no electricity, you
were a small boy, all alone.

11:43.326 --> 11:45.001
And do you know what
amazes me about you, Luc?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.836
Through everything you went through,

11:46.871 --> 11:47.971
the neglect, the abuse,

11:48.006 --> 11:50.028
you still fought to stay with her.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.010
You lied to the authorities
at every turn, to ensure it.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.111
That's none of your business.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.846
Luc, there's something broken

11:56.881 --> 11:59.015
inside of you, do you understand?

11:59.051 --> 12:00.918
Because somewhere along the way

12:00.952 --> 12:03.649
you began to equate love with deception,

12:03.683 --> 12:05.037
and now this is...

12:06.471 --> 12:07.519
What?

12:07.553 --> 12:08.926
You're needed out front, ma'am,
right away.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.097
There better be a bloody bomb
in the building.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.770
What do you want, Gutterie?

12:20.806 --> 12:22.840
I want to speak with my client.
Pronto-like.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.740
You represent Mr. Pascal
on his drug charges.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.009
I'll see you tomorrow,
in court, at 8:00, on those.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.113
But this is a separate matter.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.981
One in which Mr. Pascal has
chosen not to engage you.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.187
Is anyone representing Luc Pascal?

12:34.673 --> 12:36.854
Not even a crappy public defender?

12:36.889 --> 12:38.524
Do you know, he hasn't
asked for a lawyer.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.169
Really?

12:39.205 --> 12:41.740
Or has he not asked in
exactly the right way

12:41.774 --> 12:45.019
and you are denying him counsel
on a technicality?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.764
Let me break it down for you, Gutterie,

12:47.799 --> 12:49.268
there's nothing here for you.

12:49.648 --> 12:51.914
So pack up your toys and go home.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.705
Buzz the door, please.

12:59.177 --> 13:00.878
Grace, are you kidding me?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.480
All this time you've known Molly
was a prostitute,

13:03.504 --> 13:04.615
and you never thought to tell me?

13:04.649 --> 13:06.602
I promised her I wouldn't tell anyone.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.464
I didn't want to break my
promise after she was dead.

13:10.089 --> 13:11.621
I didn't think it would change anything.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.361
It's gonna change everything.

13:13.787 --> 13:15.158
Out of order.

13:18.864 --> 13:21.370
We have to go to the police.
Immediately.

13:21.407 --> 13:22.471
We can't.

13:22.506 --> 13:23.966
A lot of the big guys at Scotland Yard

13:24.003 --> 13:25.101
are members of the Courtenay,

13:25.136 --> 13:27.462
the Lieutenant Commissioner even.

13:27.499 --> 13:28.971
Yeah, this place is major, Nat.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.807
The clients are judges, politicians...

13:30.842 --> 13:32.042
And if Finch finds out

13:32.076 --> 13:34.778
that I've been giving tips
to the coppers,

13:34.812 --> 13:35.979
I'm done for.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.389
So that's why we need to lead the cops

13:38.424 --> 13:39.260
directly to him.

13:39.297 --> 13:41.652
But... okay, why here? Why tonight?

13:41.687 --> 13:43.086
Because he runs this place, too.

13:43.876 --> 13:46.022
Where else do you think he finds
all his girls?

13:50.028 --> 13:51.861
The man killed my best friend.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.797
And he is gonna walk around free

13:53.831 --> 13:55.899
while I go to prison
for the rest of my life.

13:58.678 --> 14:00.070
The phone is in his car.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.432
The police have got to be
looking for it.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.909
All we have to do is turn it on and...

14:07.341 --> 14:08.977
Scotland Yard will scoop him right up.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.813
If you can just get the keys from him,

14:10.849 --> 14:12.302
unlock the car,

14:12.750 --> 14:14.051
I can do the rest.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.535
Get the keys from him?

14:15.572 --> 14:17.788
He usually keeps them
in his jacket pocket.

14:21.025 --> 14:22.926
This is ridiculous.

14:22.961 --> 14:24.640
Please, Nat.

14:25.129 --> 14:27.730
If the cops bust him, I'll be free.

14:27.765 --> 14:28.966
And we can go home.

14:41.217 --> 14:42.812
I wish we could stay here forever.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.613
Can't we?

14:59.764 --> 15:01.506
You have the most beautiful eyes.

15:02.355 --> 15:04.100
I hope the baby gets them.

15:07.586 --> 15:08.703
We talked about this.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.472
We agreed you were gonna get rid of it.

15:13.044 --> 15:15.812
It is our baby.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.832
And I never agreed to anything.

15:19.402 --> 15:20.951
You just made a royal
bloody proclamation

15:20.985 --> 15:23.691
and expected me to bow down
and fall in line.

15:24.088 --> 15:27.758
But I am not your subject
and it's not your choice.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.027
I'm having this baby whether
you like it or not.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.495
You listen to me...

15:36.835 --> 15:37.967
Molly!

15:39.071 --> 15:40.636
Molly!

15:41.673 --> 15:42.773
You all right, darling?

15:47.812 --> 15:48.926
Uh...

15:49.981 --> 15:51.048
Uh, yeah.

15:51.082 --> 15:52.682
Yeah, sorry.

15:54.205 --> 15:55.709
I'm fi... I'm fine.

15:56.822 --> 15:58.822
Sorry I woke you, it was a...

15:58.856 --> 15:59.923
just a bad dream.

16:01.860 --> 16:02.958
Go back to sleep.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.390
Darling...

16:10.068 --> 16:11.768
who's Molly?

16:18.519 --> 16:21.418
Theo, who's Molly?

16:22.235 --> 16:23.072
Uh, uh...

16:24.625 --> 16:26.052
It's embarrassing.

16:26.659 --> 16:28.894
I'm going to be your wife, Theo.

16:29.639 --> 16:30.976
You can tell me anything.

16:37.929 --> 16:38.895
Uh...

16:43.172 --> 16:44.721
When I was growing up,

16:45.645 --> 16:48.084
I didn't spend much time
around other children.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.438
I didn't really have many...

16:51.652 --> 16:54.786
any... any friends.

16:56.690 --> 16:57.788
But there was this dog

16:58.879 --> 17:00.836
at the stables at Sandringham

17:01.628 --> 17:02.792
called Molly.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.942
So I'd...

17:07.733 --> 17:08.751
uh...

17:09.502 --> 17:10.928
so I used to talk to her.

17:11.637 --> 17:12.836
She knew all my secrets.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.441
Yeah, she-she wasn't well-bred
like the other dogs

17:16.476 --> 17:17.875
at the palace, she had this...

17:18.303 --> 17:20.416
wildness to her that made her...

17:21.448 --> 17:22.528
unpredictable.

17:24.518 --> 17:25.895
She sounds lovely.

17:26.895 --> 17:27.786
She was.

17:35.134 --> 17:36.423
And then, one day...

17:37.864 --> 17:38.990
she was gone.

17:40.866 --> 17:42.467
What happened to her?

17:46.910 --> 17:47.705
I don't know.

17:48.221 --> 17:49.759
Not exactly.

17:50.943 --> 17:53.295
I went to the stables,
but she wasn't there.

17:54.151 --> 17:55.680
I called for her, went...

17:55.715 --> 17:57.816
looking for her in the woods,
where she loved to run.

18:01.855 --> 18:03.157
Then I found her.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.493
There was so much blood, uh...

18:12.766 --> 18:13.865
W-What happened? What was it?

18:17.436 --> 18:18.671
I'm not sure.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.310
I think maybe...

18:22.942 --> 18:24.678
an animal got her.

18:26.694 --> 18:27.976
Oh, you poor thing.

18:28.921 --> 18:29.917
That's horrible.

18:32.519 --> 18:34.261
I'm so glad you told me.

18:35.118 --> 18:37.622
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.269
Hey.

18:55.741 --> 18:56.950
Is that book, um...

18:57.372 --> 18:58.527
telling you anything?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.320
I think so.

19:00.579 --> 19:03.146
The last few months,
Molly saw only one client.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.243
Gentleman 33.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.452
You've seen him a few times, too.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.522
Yeah.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.686
Any idea who he is?

19:14.592 --> 19:15.186
No.

19:16.005 --> 19:17.761
I was always blindfolded.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.463
I thought it was just
his kink, you know?

19:19.499 --> 19:21.413
Like how he liked Irish girls, but...

19:22.286 --> 19:24.501
well, maybe he doesn't
want anyone to know who he is.

19:24.861 --> 19:26.438
Yeah, I bet he's the one
who got her pregnant.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.298
Maybe he didn't want anyone to
know that either, so he...

19:31.444 --> 19:31.984
you know...

19:33.888 --> 19:34.971
took care of it.

19:35.903 --> 19:37.548
Don't you think Finch killed her?

19:37.705 --> 19:39.468
I mean, after what I saw tonight, I...

19:39.503 --> 19:40.417
I don't know.

19:40.453 --> 19:43.688
What Finch did today,
that was cold, clean.

19:43.723 --> 19:44.626
But Molly...

19:46.056 --> 19:47.491
whoever killed her, it was personal.

19:50.277 --> 19:52.828
Gentleman 33 took my sister personally.

19:54.141 --> 19:55.733
And I'm gonna find out who he is.

19:56.148 --> 19:57.568
Finch will find you first.

19:58.356 --> 19:59.636
He'll find both of us.

20:00.701 --> 20:01.638
He's not playing, Patrick.

20:01.674 --> 20:03.394
- He shot that man like it
was nothing. -Look at me.

20:03.809 --> 20:06.778
No one's gonna to touch you. I promise.

20:07.076 --> 20:08.861
I'll take care of him.

20:10.077 --> 20:11.449
I'll take care of you too.

20:14.957 --> 20:16.326
I couldn't protect Molly,

20:17.656 --> 20:19.893
but I'll do whatever it takes
to keep you safe.

20:22.496 --> 20:23.928
You barely know me.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.768
I know you helped me
when you didn't have to.

20:29.308 --> 20:31.452
And I know you don't deserve this life.

20:41.296 --> 20:42.680
You don't have to do that.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.555
You don't owe me anything, Kaley.

20:55.996 --> 20:58.035
This is for me.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.169
I'm giving you the truth.

21:45.203 --> 21:46.202
Now, Grace didn't kill Molly,

21:46.238 --> 21:47.237
and there isn't a single picture

21:47.272 --> 21:48.661
that can make me say she did!

21:49.008 --> 21:50.307
When you feel like talking,

21:50.342 --> 21:51.461
you let me know.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.605
Looks like you're getting nowhere.

21:59.857 --> 22:01.259
Geez.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.580
You know, I don't recall asking
for your opinion.

22:04.165 --> 22:05.549
In fact, what are you even doing here?

22:05.585 --> 22:08.133
It's the middle of the night
and this isn't your case.

22:08.169 --> 22:09.721
Oh.

22:09.756 --> 22:11.750
Did your girlfriend send you?

22:12.255 --> 22:15.492
Those blood spatter pictures
are fiction and Luc knows it.

22:15.528 --> 22:16.627
Must be pretty desperate

22:16.663 --> 22:17.862
if you're dummying up evidence
like that.

22:17.897 --> 22:20.282
It happens to be an effective
interrogation technique...

22:20.318 --> 22:22.077
one I've seen you employ many times.

22:22.114 --> 22:24.622
Yeah, except Luc isn't even near
to cracking.

22:25.230 --> 22:28.873
Listen, maybe he knows that
your two killers theory is BS,

22:28.909 --> 22:32.676
because he knows there was one
person in that room?

22:32.711 --> 22:33.912
Him.

22:34.814 --> 22:36.301
Let me have a crack at him, Gwen.

22:36.336 --> 22:37.400
Please.

22:37.851 --> 22:39.517
Little fresh blood couldn't hurt.

22:57.772 --> 23:00.183
You look almost as bored as I feel.

23:01.282 --> 23:04.268
Normally I'd be more than happy
to entertain you,

23:04.304 --> 23:06.522
but I've had a lousy night.

23:07.347 --> 23:09.417
- Another time.
- Everyone has bad nights.

23:09.453 --> 23:11.729
You just gonna cry in your
Chivas about it?

23:17.112 --> 23:20.069
Most birds don't take
that kind of tone with me.

23:20.359 --> 23:23.271
They tend to grant me more... respect.

23:23.955 --> 23:27.363
I'm not "most birds."

23:41.613 --> 23:42.785
Come dance with me.

23:42.819 --> 23:45.342
Uh... I'm not much of a dancer.

23:45.912 --> 23:47.078
Are you sure about that?

23:47.114 --> 23:48.416
Very sure.

23:54.355 --> 23:56.061
_

23:59.096 --> 24:01.366
If you want to dance, come upstairs.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.542
Upstairs?

24:03.567 --> 24:04.666
Yeah. To my office.

24:06.614 --> 24:07.969
I want to be alone with you.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.161
Hey, Luc.

24:28.761 --> 24:31.021
Thought you might need
a little pick-me-up.

24:37.307 --> 24:39.163
It's late.

24:42.252 --> 24:45.132
Look, you don't want to be here,
I don't want to be here.

24:45.805 --> 24:47.878
So I'm certainly not gonna waste
your time with any more

24:47.914 --> 24:50.915
bogus stories about how
blood spatter pictures

24:50.951 --> 24:53.951
put two people in the room
when Molly was killed.

24:54.325 --> 24:56.788
'Cause we both know that you
were the only person in the room

24:56.823 --> 24:58.143
when Molly was killed.

24:59.296 --> 25:01.826
The only thing I'm trying to figure out

25:01.862 --> 25:02.928
is how it went down.

25:02.962 --> 25:04.128
Did you go there that night

25:04.163 --> 25:06.030
with the intention of killing Molly?

25:06.066 --> 25:09.834
Or did you come downstairs,
hoping to get lucky,

25:09.869 --> 25:11.903
and things just spiraled out
of control? Because there is

25:11.939 --> 25:14.517
a world of difference
between those two things, mate.

25:15.215 --> 25:18.096
The first one... well, it's murder.

25:18.845 --> 25:21.980
And that'll see you going away
to prison for life.

25:22.615 --> 25:23.949
But the second one...

25:25.336 --> 25:26.884
that's manslaughter.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.938
You'd be out in eight to 12.

25:29.155 --> 25:30.788
Now, look at me,

25:31.721 --> 25:33.726
if it's manslaughter, I can help you,

25:33.759 --> 25:36.827
but you've got to tell me what happened.

25:39.031 --> 25:40.518
Nothing happened.

25:40.554 --> 25:42.406
Really? That's how you're gonna play it?

25:42.442 --> 25:44.356
Luc, if I don't help you, mate,

25:44.392 --> 25:48.052
the Crown Prosecutor is gonna go
after you, do you understand me?

25:48.088 --> 25:51.597
She's gonna tell the jury that
you came down from the roof

25:51.633 --> 25:53.502
with the intention of killing Molly.

25:53.538 --> 25:55.265
Why would I want to kill Molly, huh?

25:55.325 --> 25:57.755
Why would I want to kill her?
It doesn't make any sense.

25:57.789 --> 26:00.095
Because Molly was sick and tired
of being your little secret

26:00.130 --> 26:01.910
lap dance girl, wasn't she, Luc?

26:01.934 --> 26:04.031
Because Molly was gonna tell Grace,

26:04.067 --> 26:05.232
and you couldn't have that

26:05.269 --> 26:07.636
because Grace is your meal ticket, mate.

26:07.672 --> 26:08.644
Grace is the one

26:08.679 --> 26:11.272
keeping you in cocaine
and canvases, isn't she?

26:11.307 --> 26:13.008
No, no, no, t-this is all lies.

26:13.042 --> 26:14.276
That is not how it is between us, okay?

26:14.310 --> 26:16.211
That is not how it is between us.

26:20.116 --> 26:21.249
You're Grace frickin' Atwood!

26:21.679 --> 26:23.664
Would you mind taking a selfie with us?

26:24.453 --> 26:25.502
Please?

26:26.022 --> 26:27.122
Uh, just one?

26:27.156 --> 26:28.256
- Yes!
- Brilliant.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.423
Thank you.

26:33.096 --> 26:34.996
- Oh, it's a bit squinty.
- Oh, no, no, no.

26:35.031 --> 26:36.131
One more?

26:36.165 --> 26:37.198
Uh, sure.

26:50.113 --> 26:51.292
What?

26:51.882 --> 26:53.013
I just...

26:54.241 --> 26:56.240
I want to take my time.

26:57.019 --> 26:58.252
Get a good look at you.

27:36.259 --> 27:38.259
You like to be in charge, do you?

27:39.040 --> 27:40.213
Maybe.

27:42.164 --> 27:43.150
Well...

27:44.067 --> 27:45.343
so do I.

27:56.346 --> 27:57.677
Bloody hell.

27:58.013 --> 27:59.114
Damn fire alarm.

28:06.155 --> 28:07.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stay where you are.

28:07.714 --> 28:08.957
Don't move.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.224
I'll be right back.

28:10.259 --> 28:12.192
You better.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.192
Oh, geez!

29:01.785 --> 29:03.076
A camera.

29:26.147 --> 29:27.446
Ugh, you sick bastard.

29:38.013 --> 29:39.314
Oh, my God.

29:49.834 --> 29:51.834
_

30:08.444 --> 30:10.244
False alarm.

30:17.453 --> 30:19.386
Sneaky bitch!

30:39.949 --> 30:41.320
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

30:46.383 --> 30:48.383
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

30:48.417 --> 30:49.542
Are you okay?

30:50.185 --> 30:51.047
Yeah.

30:56.159 --> 30:57.567
We did it.

31:08.435 --> 31:09.834
Is everything all right?

31:12.539 --> 31:15.708
Theo told me... about Molly.

31:18.090 --> 31:19.321
He did?

31:25.618 --> 31:27.752
She wasn't a bloody dog, was she?

31:32.425 --> 31:34.593
Tell me about when you and Grace
left the party.

31:34.627 --> 31:35.904
What happened then?

31:36.364 --> 31:38.068
We went to the roof,

31:38.104 --> 31:41.400
we fooled around for a bit,
and then we fell asleep.

31:41.434 --> 31:42.634
How long for?

31:43.371 --> 31:45.436
I don't know. A while.

31:47.837 --> 31:50.064
Come on, one hour, two?

31:51.345 --> 31:52.577
Something like that.

31:52.613 --> 31:55.605
Then we woke up,
and Grace went to the toilet.

31:57.317 --> 31:58.384
What woke you up?

31:58.419 --> 32:00.042
The street sweeper went by.

32:06.426 --> 32:08.559
You never mentioned
a street sweeper before.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.395
Well, I guess I forgot.

32:10.431 --> 32:12.463
You absolutely sure
it was a street sweeper?

32:22.576 --> 32:24.993
Evan Coker, here to see Paul Day.

32:25.645 --> 32:26.825
Evan?

32:27.580 --> 32:29.615
Evan! I'm so glad to run into you.

32:29.650 --> 32:31.178
- Me?
- Yeah!

32:31.451 --> 32:32.651
I've been meaning to call you,

32:32.685 --> 32:34.752
see if you wanted to join my team.

32:35.092 --> 32:36.422
Move up to the big leagues,

32:36.457 --> 32:38.423
start making some grown-up money.

32:38.459 --> 32:39.758
Huh? Learn to start speaking "bespoke."

32:39.794 --> 32:40.759
I'd...

32:40.795 --> 32:42.493
I'd be honored.

32:42.529 --> 32:44.596
Great. Well, don't let me keep
you, I'll walk right with you.

32:44.632 --> 32:46.698
- Oh, fantastic.
- All righty.

32:46.733 --> 32:49.535
I think I'd be a real asset
to your firm.

32:49.569 --> 32:50.621
Uh-huh.

32:51.439 --> 32:52.738
And I'd bring Danishes every Friday.

32:57.711 --> 32:59.677
I can tell you with absolute certainty,

32:59.712 --> 33:04.603
that the street sweeper
went by the flat at 2:13 a.m.

33:05.385 --> 33:06.538
So?

33:07.320 --> 33:11.522
So Molly Ryan wasn't killed
until very close to 2:45 a.m.

33:11.558 --> 33:14.914
Which means that when Grace
came downstairs,

33:15.362 --> 33:17.217
Molly was still alive.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.665
No, Grace just went down to pee,
that's all.

33:20.701 --> 33:23.535
She, she was only gone a few minutes.

33:23.570 --> 33:25.144
Someone must have attacked Molly

33:25.181 --> 33:27.250
after Grace came back to the roof.

33:28.409 --> 33:32.034
Then how did Grace get Molly's
blood all over her feet?

33:34.837 --> 33:35.852
No.

33:36.416 --> 33:37.715
How?

33:37.750 --> 33:39.750
She was gone longer than
a few minutes, wasn't she?

33:39.787 --> 33:42.320
- No.
- Yes, she was.

33:42.355 --> 33:44.589
How long was she gone for?
An hour? Two hours?

33:44.625 --> 33:46.092
I don't know.

33:46.127 --> 33:47.759
Grace must have passed out
on the toilet,

33:47.795 --> 33:49.755
and stumbled out after murder.

33:50.498 --> 33:52.564
So let me just be clear now,
you're admitting to me

33:52.599 --> 33:55.433
that she was gone for longer
than a couple of minutes.

33:59.606 --> 34:01.096
Eh, you're twisting my words.

34:01.121 --> 34:02.574
How long was she gone for?

34:04.511 --> 34:05.989
Tell me. Tell me.

34:06.023 --> 34:07.412
How long, Luc? Come on, tell me, mate.

34:07.448 --> 34:08.646
Luc!

34:10.317 --> 34:12.764
How long was she gone for, Luc?

34:13.353 --> 34:14.900
Close to an hour.

34:27.534 --> 34:29.268
But listen, but listen,

34:29.302 --> 34:30.594
I know she didn't kill Molly!

34:34.474 --> 34:36.641
You did it!

34:36.677 --> 34:39.478
That's Grace Atwood in the flat
at the time of the murder,

34:39.512 --> 34:41.413
with enough time to kill Molly Ryan.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.382
You did it!

34:44.418 --> 34:45.617
Oh...

34:49.322 --> 34:50.521
Is there a problem?

34:53.083 --> 34:54.393
No problem.

34:54.427 --> 34:55.427
Good.

34:57.364 --> 35:00.298
Well! You wanted back on
the case, and here you are.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.668
Now, go and arrest Grace Atwood.

35:05.539 --> 35:06.789
Sure.

35:19.353 --> 35:21.353
I want to see Luc Pascal. Now.

35:21.387 --> 35:22.588
Go ahead.

35:25.693 --> 35:27.900
He's been very helpful, you know.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.663
I'm issuing an arrest warrant
for Grace Atwood.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.762
For the murder of Molly Ryan.

35:45.485 --> 35:46.451
Mr. Finch?

35:47.818 --> 35:48.885
You better have something for me,

35:48.920 --> 35:50.052
'cause I am not in the mood.

35:58.996 --> 36:00.302
How'd you get this?

36:00.965 --> 36:02.396
I did what I'm good at.

36:03.001 --> 36:04.661
And, um, don't worry...

36:05.429 --> 36:06.702
there aren't any copies.

36:06.737 --> 36:07.621
Who the hell is he?

36:10.389 --> 36:11.840
It's Molly Ryan's brother.

36:14.746 --> 36:16.277
He's staying on a houseboat.

36:17.014 --> 36:19.141
Wharf Road, number 17.

36:32.864 --> 36:34.097
Somebody find him!

37:00.858 --> 37:02.346
Take your time.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.726
Slow and steady wins the race.

37:07.865 --> 37:09.463
Oh, Grace.

37:14.773 --> 37:15.938
How am I doing?

37:18.842 --> 37:21.072
Now do you like me better than Molly?

37:29.887 --> 37:30.894
What is it, Stan?

37:35.927 --> 37:36.925
What?

37:44.969 --> 37:46.188
Stan called.

37:48.139 --> 37:49.481
Is Luc getting out?

37:49.873 --> 37:51.548
Yeah, Luc is out, but...

37:53.563 --> 37:54.663
But what?

37:57.882 --> 37:59.304
The police are coming.

38:00.391 --> 38:01.597
To arrest you.

38:03.121 --> 38:04.753
They got to Luc, they...

38:04.789 --> 38:05.780
No.

38:06.958 --> 38:09.057
He wouldn't do that to me.
There's no way.

38:09.092 --> 38:10.351
Grace...

38:11.728 --> 38:12.862
This can't be happening.

38:14.699 --> 38:15.764
Can't be happening.

38:19.768 --> 38:20.994
You can't let them take me, Nat.

38:47.898 --> 38:49.081
I have a warrant.

38:50.001 --> 38:52.134
Yeah. We heard.

39:09.503 --> 39:11.853
You're under arrest for
the murder of Molly Ryan.

39:11.889 --> 39:13.416
Put your hands out, please.

39:16.126 --> 39:17.793
Look, do you really have to do that?

39:17.829 --> 39:19.376
She's gonna go with you willingly.

39:19.731 --> 39:21.664
It's protocol.
Put your hands out, please.

39:21.699 --> 39:22.831
It's gon... it's gonna be okay.

39:22.867 --> 39:24.699
Stan and I will sort this out.

39:24.735 --> 39:26.702
You just need to be strong, okay?

39:26.737 --> 39:28.760
Grace? Grace?

39:30.742 --> 39:32.041
Put your hands out.

39:55.501 --> 39:56.798
Son of a bitch!

39:58.869 --> 40:00.735
We finally got a hit
on Molly Ryan's phone.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.927
Back! Back! Back!

40:24.963 --> 40:26.195
Get back!

40:29.800 --> 40:30.865
Back!

40:30.902 --> 40:32.068
Get back!

40:39.844 --> 40:41.943
- Let me go! Grace! Grace!
- Let her go. Get back.

40:43.114 --> 40:44.213
I love you.

41:37.367 --> 41:39.402
Previously on "Dead of Summer"...

41:39.436 --> 41:41.302
No one knows anything about him.

41:41.338 --> 41:42.605
You only want him
'cause you can't have him.

41:42.639 --> 41:44.672
We have a connection.

41:44.708 --> 41:46.641
Someone didn't want us to find this.

41:46.677 --> 41:48.411
What's with the box?

41:48.445 --> 41:49.612
It's a reminder.

41:49.646 --> 41:51.547
I had a bad dream last night.

41:51.581 --> 41:55.284
There were these people wearing masks.

41:55.318 --> 41:57.219
I think they were doing
some kind of ritual.

41:57.255 --> 41:58.621
Amy!

41:58.655 --> 42:00.688
It appears we were wrong. It's her.

42:12.335 --> 42:16.271
Andrea! You are going to ruin
my flooring.

42:16.306 --> 42:19.675
Oh, look at you. What did you do?

42:19.710 --> 42:21.543
Look, Mommy. Look what I did.

42:21.579 --> 42:24.480
Mrs. Walker made us draw
pictures of ourselves.

42:24.514 --> 42:27.516
Oh? A self-portrait? Show Mommy.

42:29.519 --> 42:31.320
This is your picture?

42:33.324 --> 42:36.257
But... But it's a boy.

42:36.293 --> 42:38.594
I am a boy.

42:38.628 --> 42:41.429
Don't be silly.

42:41.465 --> 42:46.335
You are my little beautiful
Andrea, and you always will be.

42:48.271 --> 42:50.239
You can't hide what you are.

43:24.442 --> 43:27.309
Oh. Look who decided to join us.

43:27.344 --> 43:29.244
Morning to you, too.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.380
Hey, how come you don't shower
with your cabin?

43:31.414 --> 43:34.382
I was out for a run this morning,
and I saw you leaving the bathroom.

43:34.418 --> 43:36.719
Why do you care? You got a crush?

43:38.356 --> 43:40.623
Any news on Amy?

43:40.657 --> 43:43.259
- Nothing.
- I'm sure she's fine.

43:43.293 --> 43:45.360
Really? You're a doctor now?

43:45.396 --> 43:48.197
"Friday the 13th Part VII."

43:48.231 --> 43:49.664
What?

43:49.699 --> 43:52.367
Jason gets hit by lightning
in the opening.

43:52.402 --> 43:54.202
Not only is he fine,

43:54.237 --> 43:56.672
but he comes back to life,
better than ever.

43:56.706 --> 43:59.307
Yes, because supernatural
monster rules apply to Amy.

44:02.713 --> 44:04.646
Anything?

44:06.284 --> 44:08.384
Yeah. I figured.

44:08.418 --> 44:11.320
Well, I've got mail.

44:11.355 --> 44:13.688
Blair...

44:13.724 --> 44:16.324
Jessie...

44:16.360 --> 44:18.393
and...

44:18.429 --> 44:21.297
What do I do with Blotter's?

44:21.331 --> 44:24.233
Do what he was gonna do... smoke it.

44:24.268 --> 44:25.266
Nice.

44:34.411 --> 44:39.315
Hey. Come on, you guys.
Enough moping around, all right?

44:39.349 --> 44:41.282
Look what I found.

44:41.318 --> 44:43.318
Summer of '83!

44:43.353 --> 44:46.355
- Summer of '83.
- Wow.

44:50.293 --> 44:52.327
Oh, no! Oh, man.

44:54.231 --> 44:56.331
Look at you. Wow.

44:56.367 --> 44:58.233
Cricket, so cute.

44:58.268 --> 44:59.635
Oh, I look

45:01.239 --> 45:02.371
Oh, what was her name again?

45:02.405 --> 45:06.675
Um, Andrea, and she was a total bitch.

45:06.710 --> 45:09.210
- She wasn't that bad.
- I don't remember her at all.

45:09.246 --> 45:11.213
She had pretty good taste in music.

45:11.248 --> 45:12.380
Wonder what happened to her.

45:12.416 --> 45:14.682
She's fine.

45:14.719 --> 45:17.253
Amy is fine.

45:17.288 --> 45:18.686
She's gonna make a full recovery.

45:18.722 --> 45:21.222
In fact, the doctor said

45:21.259 --> 45:22.690
she's well enough to come back to work.

45:22.726 --> 45:25.360
One day? After being hit by lightning.

45:25.396 --> 45:27.262
"Friday the 13th."

45:27.297 --> 45:29.697
Let's just welcome her back
with some camp spirit.

45:29.733 --> 45:32.233
I'm gonna push the schedule up a bit.

45:32.269 --> 45:34.269
Tonight will be the masquerade ball.

45:34.304 --> 45:37.273
All right, let's go make some masks.

45:45.282 --> 45:47.215
I'm not sure

45:47.251 --> 45:49.652
what a post-lightning strike
regimen should be,

45:49.686 --> 45:52.353
but my mom makes a mean chocolate shake.

45:53.657 --> 45:55.291
Thanks.

45:55.326 --> 45:58.293
Vanilla? I knew
I should've gone vanilla.

45:58.329 --> 46:01.262
