00:01.167 --> 00:03.461
[Jughead] A war has been
brewing in Riverdale

00:03.503 --> 00:07.215
between Percival Pickens
and Archie Andrews.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.676
A conflict
between good and evil,

00:09.718 --> 00:12.679
or in this incarnation,

00:12.721 --> 00:16.975
between those who work
and those who exploit workers.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.644
Before we begin construction
of my railroad,

00:19.686 --> 00:22.355
a few minor details.
Starting today,

00:23.356 --> 00:24.858
my company will provide you

00:24.899 --> 00:27.986
with all the tools
and equipment you require.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.156
This rental fee will
be deducted from your pay.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.991
Our pay,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.784
which is actually less than
what we discussed, Mr. Mayor.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.578
Well, I'm simply responding

00:36.619 --> 00:39.664
to fluctuations
in the marketplace,
Mr. Fogarty.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.252
Get to work.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.212
[Archie] Percival
has started construction,

00:46.254 --> 00:48.173
which is bad news for us,

00:48.214 --> 00:51.384
especially if it's not
an ordinary train
that he's building.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.720
-Cheryl, you called it--
-A ghost train,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.681
which would grant him
dominion over the souls
of the living and the dead.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.392
Which, of course,
one can't just run
around saying to people.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.729
Most of Percival's crew
used to work for you, Archie.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.481
Can't you convince them
to quit?

01:04.522 --> 01:07.400
No way. No. A lot of these guys
haven't worked in months.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.902
They'll take
whatever they can get,

01:08.943 --> 01:10.862
even if they're being
exploited or abused.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.489
Which gives Percival
the upper hand.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.282
For the moment.
But now that he's got a crew,

01:14.324 --> 01:15.658
he's breaking all the promises

01:15.700 --> 01:17.452
that he made
to get them to sign up.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.830
-He's also 100% anti-union.
-[Tabitha] Of course he is.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.582
Unions literally unite people

01:22.624 --> 01:25.752
and united people
are more difficult to control.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.838
And Percival, as we know,
is all about control.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.340
And tweed.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.342
He's trying to break
the workers' spirits,

01:32.383 --> 01:34.427
their resolve.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.639
A lot of these guys have
spent most of their lives
working union jobs.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.558
I mean, if I can do some good
old-fashioned agitating,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.227
remind them
that Percival's values

01:42.268 --> 01:44.187
are the exact opposite
of their own,

01:44.229 --> 01:45.814
that he doesn't care
about them,

01:45.855 --> 01:47.857
we might be able to get them
to vote to unionize.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.819
So that instead of quitting,
the workers would strike.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.612
Work on the railway would stop.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.490
And once again
we're in a battle
for the town's soul.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.991
What exactly can I do?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.077
Sing Bruce Springsteen covers?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.745
No, thank you.
Dua Lipa or bust.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.747
Ah, no, Cheryl.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
But the Blossoms
and the Pickens

02:04.249 --> 02:06.126
have a long history
of working together.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.254
For which I am deeply ashamed.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.588
Are there any family records

02:10.630 --> 02:12.590
or documents
that you could raid

02:12.632 --> 02:15.135
for damning evidence
we could use against Percival?

02:15.176 --> 02:17.720
As a matter of fact,
a friend and I are currently
in the process

02:17.762 --> 02:20.306
of cataloguing
the Blossom archives.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.101
I'll let you know
if I find any dish or dirt.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.061
Now, can I please go?

02:27.605 --> 02:30.817
And, Archie, if you really
want to rally support
against Percival,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.862
one of my waitresses heard
that Percival's apparently

02:33.903 --> 02:36.531
making his crew
pay for their own coffee.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.826
So why don't you
and I head down there
in one of my pop's trucks

02:39.868 --> 02:43.079
and, you know,
innocently hand out
some free cups of joe.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.415
Maybe suggest
they start hanging out here,

02:45.456 --> 02:47.250
the headquarters
of the Resistance.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.715
So when did
your poison powers
first start to manifest?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.466
A few weeks ago.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.552
Did anything traumatic
happen to you right beforehand?

02:59.429 --> 03:04.851
My father, his death
was definitely traumatizing.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.479
Wait, are you Veronica Lodge
as in, Lodge Rum?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.316
-I am.
-I knew your father.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.650
Well, of your father.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.735
How did you know Hiram?

03:13.776 --> 03:15.820
I used to be an ATF agent.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.032
I was part of the team
tracking his rum
and Jingle-Jangle operations

03:19.073 --> 03:22.160
before I got reassigned
to busting up
illegal absinthe rings.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.245
Wait, I thought
absinthe was legal.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.873
A watered down,
regulated version is.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.126
But there is
an underground market
that caters to purists,

03:30.168 --> 03:33.087
those that don't mind
that real absinthe
is poisonous.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.506
Wormwood, one of its
main ingredients,

03:35.548 --> 03:38.384
provides its signature
flavor and green color

03:39.260 --> 03:41.346
but it's extremely toxic.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.265
Which actually brings me
back to you, Veronica.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.184
According to your blood work,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.186
you're one of the healthiest
people I've ever met.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.938
While your body
may be producing poison,

03:49.979 --> 03:53.107
it's filtering out the toxins
at an even faster rate.

03:53.149 --> 03:57.445
Your entire body is basically
one giant bio-dialysis machine.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.571
[cell phone ringing]

04:03.826 --> 04:05.453
Mom, what is it? I'm at work.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.000
Where is he?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.585
-He's upstairs in your room.
-[grunts]

04:18.341 --> 04:19.592
[machine beeping]

04:23.972 --> 04:25.014
[Moose] Sweet digs.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.059
Gotta ask.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.644
How do you afford this?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.771
Uh, Percival
is helping me out a bit.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.649
Of course he is.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.318
It was time for me
to get out of my dad's house.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.612
I need to establish
a permanent residency.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.863
To get custody of Anthony?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.199
You're still going ahead
with that?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.952
Yes, Moose, I am.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.538
I don't have much of a choice.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.712
[Betty] What's happening
to Charles?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.214
It's simple, Betty. He's dying.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.592
But how? Wh... Why?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.177
They don't know exactly.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.763
They think it's some sort
of sepsis or leukemia.

05:05.805 --> 05:10.018
And the prison
infirmary is full,
so they sent him home.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.686
Poor Charles.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.772
Whatever awful things he did,
he's still your brother.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.607
And what he needs
right now is family.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.445
So can we please
just call a truce?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.905
Spend what little time
he has left together.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.043
[sighs] There you go.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.424
Cup of coffee, Uncle Frank?
It's free.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.134
This is against company policy.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.677
Calm down, Frank.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.179
We're just stopping by
to let everybody know

05:46.220 --> 05:47.889
about a new special
we're having at Pop's

05:47.930 --> 05:50.266
in honor of our new location.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.060
Twenty-five cent burgers.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.936
[workers cheering]

05:53.978 --> 05:56.522
Same price
as they were back in '49.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.692
Yeah, you know,
the year the unions
first came to Riverdale.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.361
Swing by after
your shift, fellas.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.404
We're having a bit
of an open mic night.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.324
Bye.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.621
[thunder rumbling]

06:39.607 --> 06:40.483
Mmm.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.865
Well, your suspicions
were correct, Reggie.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.035
Mr. Jones certainly stole
a memory from you.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.372
His psychic fingerprints
were all over your mind.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.124
Yeah, it's like an itch
I can't scratch

06:56.165 --> 06:58.251
and it's driving me crazy.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.336
Hmm. I must admit,

07:00.378 --> 07:03.339
I underestimated
Mr. Jones' powers.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.466
It may be that he is
a more formidable threat

07:05.508 --> 07:07.301
than I had originally
anticipated.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.220
Hey, you said you were
going to teach me magic.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.346
When's that going to happen?

07:19.730 --> 07:22.108
-Is that me?
-It's a totem.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.111
Something to teach you
one of the oldest arts
of deception...

07:26.487 --> 07:27.572
ventriloquism.

07:31.325 --> 07:34.662
Tomorrow, during Jughead's act,

07:34.704 --> 07:38.166
you are going to distract him
by throwing your voice.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.251
Meanwhile, I'm going
to sneak into his mind

07:40.293 --> 07:44.297
and open the floodgates,
as it were.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.007
Hopefully do some damage.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.467
Not enough to kill him,

07:47.508 --> 07:49.719
but certainly enough
to incapacitate him.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.320
Thank you.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.866
So I heard Percival changed
the terms of your contract.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.284
Big time.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.287
Longer hours,
lower pay, no overtime.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.247
You know, you have options.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.791
Rights that protect you
from this kind of abuse.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.043
You're talking
about unionizing.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.586
Percival's never
gonna go for that.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.004
No, he won't.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.839
Because he wants
all the power for himself.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.091
But, Carlos,
you used to be a union man.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.259
Your dad was too.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.761
-Just like mine.
-Yeah.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.471
The union protected them.
It can protect you.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.014
We can't quit, Archie.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.058
[Archie] I'm not telling you
to quit, Fangs.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.809
I'm reminding you that
you're the ones
building the railroad

08:38.851 --> 08:41.312
while Percival sits
in his champagne suite.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.272
-[Fogarty sighs]
-And Carlos, you're right.

08:43.314 --> 08:47.026
Probably Percival will say no
if you ask to unionize.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.110
But what's the harm in trying?

08:50.863 --> 08:53.616
[Veronica] Thank you
for agreeing to sit down
with me, Agent Drake.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.826
What can I do for you,
Veronica?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.787
You're familiar
with my family business.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.540
Well, our little convo earlier
got me thinking

09:00.581 --> 09:04.085
about pivoting off rum
to absinthe.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.629
It's dangerous stuff.

09:08.381 --> 09:12.760
What if I were to distill
a version of absinthe

09:12.802 --> 09:14.720
that contained wormwood

09:14.762 --> 09:18.015
but wasn't deadly
when ingested
in large quantities?

09:18.057 --> 09:20.518
I'd say you'd be creating
a new, lucrative
market for yourself.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.230
And can I get in on it?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.399
[Charles] Thanks for giving up
your room for me, Betty.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.025
[Betty sighs]
I've mostly been...

09:29.277 --> 09:31.195
staying next door.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.114
Hey, how's Chic?

09:33.155 --> 09:36.325
Did you guys ever end up...
[chuckles] getting married?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.369
No.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
No, I haven't seen him
since the prison escape.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.292
They put us in separate wings
when they took us
back to Shankshaw.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.962
So sadly,
I've had zero contact with him.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.298
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.967
But, you know, Chic,
he's a survivor.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.595
Unlike me, apparently.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.057
Can I ask you something?

10:02.977 --> 10:05.521
Are you afraid
of what's coming?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.732
Death and what comes after it?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.568
I've made my peace with it.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.156
I've done some terrible,
terrible things, Betty.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.491
And this, I guess, is my, uh,

10:18.451 --> 10:19.493
my punishment.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.458
[Cheryl] Oh, Heather...

10:25.499 --> 10:29.879
I'm sorry we had
to put my witch training
on hold for research.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.005
I hope you don't mind.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.923
[Heather] Not at all.

10:32.965 --> 10:37.720
And I believe
I've just found something.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.890
This letter references
the Malleus Maleficarum.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.351
The Malleus what?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.895
One of the most powerful
arcane texts in existence.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.688
Okay. So, according
to this letter,

10:47.730 --> 10:50.191
a feud between the Blossoms
and Pickens clans broke out

10:50.232 --> 10:51.776
because a Pickens ancestor

10:51.817 --> 10:56.072
stole the Maleficarum
from a Blossom ancestor.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.366
I don't think this is the kind
of dirt Archie had in mind.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.619
No, but if Percival
is an evil sorcerer

11:01.661 --> 11:05.581
in possession
of the Maleficarum,
we must get it back.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.833
Didn't you say
his Curiosity Shop

11:07.875 --> 11:09.543
was a veritable treasure trove

11:09.585 --> 11:11.545
of arcane artifacts
and esoterica?

11:11.587 --> 11:12.838
Yes.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.882
Also, retrieving
the Maleficarum

11:14.924 --> 11:17.093
provides us
with the perfect opportunity

11:17.134 --> 11:19.220
for me to teach you
a new spell.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.138
Tell me, Cheryl,
how much do you know

11:21.180 --> 11:23.057
about turning unseeable?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.809
Only from Harry Potter

11:24.850 --> 11:26.602
and the Wizards
of Waverly Place

11:26.644 --> 11:29.271
-that you need a special cloak.
-To turn unseeable,

11:29.313 --> 11:32.024
you just have to be able
to hold your breath
and keep a level head

11:32.066 --> 11:34.485
as you bend the spectrum
of visible light around you.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.196
Don't worry, I can teach you.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.031
Okay.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.199
[knocking at door]

11:42.493 --> 11:44.787
-So, so sorry to drop in.
-What is it, Veronica?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.122
I have company
and we're in the middle

11:46.163 --> 11:47.456
of something
much more interesting

11:47.498 --> 11:49.166
than whatever
you're about to say.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.961
I'm looking for a book
about how to distill absinthe

11:52.002 --> 11:55.005
as well as any wormwood
you might have
in your greenhouse.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.051
[sighs deeply] Fine.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.469
Wait here, Spider-Woman.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.473
[footsteps receding]

12:04.515 --> 12:07.768
Archie, it appears
you've been talking
to my crew behind my back.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.311
I didn't know
I needed your permission.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.354
Well, listen...

12:12.064 --> 12:13.232
I've got a proposition,

12:14.066 --> 12:15.359
an offer that could prove

12:15.401 --> 12:16.360
mutually beneficial.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.447
Why don't you join my team?

12:23.659 --> 12:25.369
You want me to work for you?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.539
Look, I empathize
with your concerns
for my employees.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.916
And the truth is, I could
use a man like you,

12:30.958 --> 12:32.209
someone who would
keep me honest

12:32.251 --> 12:34.086
and protect the crew
he commands

12:34.128 --> 12:36.547
all while earning
a pretty penny for his efforts.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.386
You know,
the fact that you think

12:42.428 --> 12:45.222
that I can be bought or bribed

12:46.265 --> 12:49.185
just goes to show how corrupt

12:49.226 --> 12:50.895
-and deluded you are.
-Hmm.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.274
Still, maybe you'll change
your mind, eh?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.318
Mmm. And maybe
you'll come to realize

12:57.359 --> 12:59.945
that whatever it is
you're really building,

12:59.987 --> 13:01.614
Riverdale is not
the place for it.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.202
And how long have you been
a part of the Serpents, Toni?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.037
-My entire life.
-You as well, Fangs?

13:08.078 --> 13:11.248
I was born a Serpent,
and I'll die a Serpent.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.376
According to both your files,
you have multiple arrests
between the two of you.

13:14.418 --> 13:17.797
Mostly misdemeanors
but these are extensive
rap sheets.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.591
Well, most of those
incidents happened
when we were juveniles.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.051
It sounds like we're on trial.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.136
You are. Kevin's lawyers
are going to use

13:24.178 --> 13:27.473
every bit of information
to expose you both
as unfit parents.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.600
He's also asked for
a paternity test for Anthony.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.227
-[scoffs]
-Hell, no. Whatever
the results are,

13:31.268 --> 13:32.728
he's just going to use it
against us.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.896
I said as much.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.942
Shifting gears.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
Have you given any thought
to possibly retiring
from the Serpents?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.320
We're not retiring.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.822
We haven't figured
that out yet.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.241
The Serpents
are in a bit of a transition.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.578
Rebranding from biker gang
to political activist group.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.998
Well, if that's gonna happen,
I suggest it happens fast.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.377
[clicks tongue]

13:59.880 --> 14:00.798
[grunts]

14:02.675 --> 14:04.301
-I don't like her.
-Me neither.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.762
But we don't have
to like her, Fangs.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.722
She just needs
to win this case for us.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.644
Have you thought any more
about my proposal?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.437
Yeah, I have.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.190
And I just want to make sure

14:18.232 --> 14:19.984
that I'm getting married
for the right reason.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.528
Wouldn't stability
in Baby Anthony's life

14:22.570 --> 14:23.779
be the right reason?

14:24.655 --> 14:27.241
Us being a family united.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.742
You mean, like the Serpents?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.162
[sighs softly]

14:37.877 --> 14:39.295
I see something
through the fog.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.089
Oh!

14:42.131 --> 14:44.550
The first date that you had
with your fiance...

14:44.592 --> 14:46.010
[woman] The Bijou Theater.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.679
...was at the Bijou Theater.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.348
Yes. Oh, my God, that's right.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.017
[crowd cheering]

14:55.644 --> 14:56.604
[heckler] You're a fraud.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.733
Ladies and gentlemen,
please no heckling.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.027
Forsythe must have
complete focus.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.571
[heckler] Your act is a joke.
Get off the stage.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.240
Is it Reggie?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.793
-[wind blowing]
-[thunder rumbling]

15:23.797 --> 15:24.840
[chuckles softly]

15:31.096 --> 15:32.056
[doorknob rattling]

15:35.225 --> 15:36.727
[thunder rumbling]

15:45.194 --> 15:46.820
Breaking into Mr. Jones' mind

15:46.862 --> 15:48.906
won't be as simple
as I thought.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.450
I need something
to pry my way in.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.826
A talisman.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.663
An object of Mr. Jones',

15:55.704 --> 15:58.332
something that's an essential
part of his being.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.710
Any notions?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.463
Back in high school,
you never saw Jones
without his stupid beanie.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.424
He wore it every day, 24/7.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.385
Mmm.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.720
He buried it in a time capsule.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.934
But I know exactly
where that is.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.312
You will deliver
the beanie unto me.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.482
I will also need some other
objects of Mr. Jones'.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.442
When I slip
back into his mind,

16:25.484 --> 16:27.778
I mustn't be recognized
as a hostile entity.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.282
This time,
the disguise must be absolute.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.248
So you asked management
to unionize.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.750
-What did they tell you?
-To go pound sand.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.877
Because Percival
doesn't care about you.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.965
All you asked for
was to be treated fairly,
like human beings.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.591
Well, he doesn't
see you that way.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.135
To him,
you're a piece of equipment,

16:51.176 --> 16:52.845
like a shovel
or a sledgehammer.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.514
And make no mistake,
Riverdale is at a crossroads.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.016
What you do now

16:57.057 --> 16:58.767
will not only set the course
of your future

16:58.809 --> 17:01.729
but the future of your children
and their children.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.689
Don't we want to live in a town

17:03.731 --> 17:05.107
where if we put in
an honest day's work,

17:05.149 --> 17:07.443
we get paid
an honest day's rate?

17:07.484 --> 17:10.320
So we can keep
a roof over our heads
and feed our families?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.655
[all] Yeah.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.077
[Betty] What about
from your childhood?

17:17.119 --> 17:20.039
Could you tell that there was
something different about you?

17:20.080 --> 17:22.124
Boy, you do not let up.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.586
I'll admit, I'm trying
to better understand
certain parts of myself.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.546
There was this...

17:29.465 --> 17:30.674
one time...

17:32.384 --> 17:34.720
I caught a possum in a trap

17:34.762 --> 17:36.889
in the attic
of The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.725
And what did you do with it?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.685
Call it, um,

17:41.727 --> 17:44.563
textbook serial killer
behavior, total...

17:45.355 --> 17:47.149
cliche, really. [coughs]

17:50.819 --> 17:52.613
[inhales sharply]
Kind of like, um,

17:53.572 --> 17:56.575
when you killed Caramel.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.452
[Caramel meows]

18:00.120 --> 18:01.705
[Caramel screams]

18:01.747 --> 18:03.415
No, no, no.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.210
Those examples
are nothing alike.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.920
Caramel was a mercy kill.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.966
I think about
that possum a lot.

18:13.008 --> 18:16.386
I imagine if I could
go back in time
and set it free...

18:17.471 --> 18:18.639
instead of, um...

18:20.099 --> 18:22.059
doing what I did to it,

18:24.645 --> 18:25.521
maybe...

18:27.231 --> 18:29.483
my shadow-self
would have remained dormant.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.612
Crazy to imagine, huh?

18:33.654 --> 18:34.613
Yeah.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.995
I know.
Total heartbreaker, right?

18:42.955 --> 18:43.997
He gets that from me.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.166
Looks just like his daddy.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.920
Anthony's not your son.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.464
If he was, you wouldn't have
walked out on him
like a coward.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.841
Hey, dude,
what the hell is your problem?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.551
You're my damn problem, Kevin.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.682
Okay, remember, as long as
you're holding your breath

19:01.723 --> 19:03.600
and thinking of the spell
I gave you,

19:03.642 --> 19:05.102
he won't be able to see you.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.146
I am already
saying it silently to myself.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.232
[inhales deeply]

19:13.443 --> 19:14.444
[bell dings]

19:14.486 --> 19:15.445
[door squeaks]

19:33.255 --> 19:34.590
Hello, miss.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.383
Welcome to my Curiosity Shop.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.094
I'm on a hunt for a gift
for a friend.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.762
Mmm.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.181
Mind telling me about
some of your favorite items?

19:42.222 --> 19:43.265
Well, that would be
my pleasure.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.396
[exhales deeply]

20:01.700 --> 20:04.870
Well, I just happen
to have some very rare

20:04.912 --> 20:06.788
ancient Viking battle knives

20:06.830 --> 20:08.790
from a collector I know
in Normandy.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.542
[objects clattering]

20:10.584 --> 20:13.337
Uh, that sounds fascinating.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.297
Please tell me more about that.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.673
Back in a tick.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.011
[inhales deeply]

20:46.703 --> 20:49.414
I'm sorry to be a nudge,
but I'm in a bit of a rush.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.415
Be right there, miss.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.465
Hmm.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.136
[exhales]

21:08.558 --> 21:12.437
[Veronica] "Absinthe's
key ingredient, of course,
is royal wormwood."

21:18.527 --> 21:22.197
Okay, if I'm a human
dialysis machine

21:22.239 --> 21:26.702
and my body is metabolizing
the poison I'm producing...

21:28.370 --> 21:31.957
maybe I can leech it
out of this wormwood.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.839
[sighs deeply]

21:38.880 --> 21:42.426
It's like looking at
a reflection of myself, Arch.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.011
Like a preview.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.179
Agent Drake was telling me
about this theory

21:46.221 --> 21:50.892
that moral corruption
leads to bodily corruption.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.521
So what if Charles's evil,

21:54.563 --> 21:57.482
his malignancy,
is what's poisoning
and killing him?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.817
Different people or not,

21:58.859 --> 22:01.236
it's the same darkness
that I have.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.863
He just succumbed to his

22:02.904 --> 22:04.823
and started killing people,
and now he's dying.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.951
It's like a poison that's
rotting him from the inside...

22:10.704 --> 22:12.456
[intense music playing]

22:12.497 --> 22:14.875
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.919
[device beeping]

22:19.546 --> 22:22.007
Mom, stop! Stop!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.217
[beeping slows]

22:24.259 --> 22:25.802
-[Charles wheezing]
-Stop.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.804
[coughing]

22:29.681 --> 22:32.225
I can't believe you, Fangs.
You pick a fight with Kevin

22:32.267 --> 22:34.561
right before we're supposed
to get into a room
with a judge.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.938
If you would have
even landed one punch,

22:36.980 --> 22:38.940
our case would have
ended right there, Fangs.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.901
Oh, so now you're taking
Kevin's side over mine?

22:40.942 --> 22:42.527
Even as he's running
around town,

22:42.569 --> 22:44.029
claiming to be
Anthony's real father.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.281
I'm not.
I'm taking Anthony's side.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.908
-[Anthony crying]
-And maybe you should too,

22:47.949 --> 22:49.409
instead of worrying so much
about your damn ego.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.703
[Anthony crying]

22:52.704 --> 22:54.039
[door slams]

22:54.081 --> 22:55.582
Why, Elizabeth?
Why did you stop me?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.584
-Mom.
-He is in pain.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.170
You know, this is why
he came home.
He asked for this.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.006
This was his plan. Our plan.
A swift death.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.257
Mom, shut up!

23:05.550 --> 23:08.303
I understand that
you might think

23:08.345 --> 23:09.888
that this is
the right thing to do.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.140
-It is the right thing to do.
-I promise you,

23:12.182 --> 23:14.267
you will regret it.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.896
In a week, in two months,
in three years,
for the rest of your life.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.272
So what are we supposed to do?

23:19.314 --> 23:20.607
Just let him suffer?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.484
-I don't know.
-Well, I do.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.487
Honestly, I don't have a clue,
but you're not gonna do this.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.618
There has been enough
murder in this house.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.212
[Heather] I never imagined
I would hold this book
in my hands.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.550
Well done... witch.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.387
As much as I'd love to sit

23:50.429 --> 23:51.972
and read sweet passages
aloud to each other,

23:52.013 --> 23:54.307
methinks we should return
to the Blossom archives

23:54.349 --> 23:56.059
and see if we can find
anything to help

23:56.101 --> 23:58.103
Archie and his latest
drab crusade.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.188
Of course.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.275
There is a collection of
letters I was sorting.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.527
Work correspondence,
it seems,

24:05.569 --> 24:08.405
that might require
further scrutiny.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.750
[Percival] Hmm.
Well played, Reggie.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.252
And you left
everything undisturbed?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.671
-Mmm-hmm. You know it.
-Good.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.217
Very good.

24:29.259 --> 24:33.680
Oh, Mr. Jones,
you're really not gonna
like what comes next.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.943
Kevin, can I ask,

24:46.985 --> 24:49.613
do you really not
know which of you
is Anthony's real father?

24:49.654 --> 24:52.574
We don't. We wanted it
to be that way

24:52.616 --> 24:54.910
so that neither Fangs
or I would feel

24:54.951 --> 24:56.578
like less of a father
than the other.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.874
Why do you ask?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.792
I'm just trying to understand
why you're so hell-bent

25:02.834 --> 25:04.294
on ruining your friendships
to get sole custody.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.798
Makes me think that maybe

25:08.840 --> 25:10.759
it's because you're afraid
you're not his real father.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.096
[telephone ringing]

25:18.016 --> 25:19.726
-Hello.
-[Percival] Mr. Andrews,

25:19.768 --> 25:22.854
I was just ringing to see
if you'd reconsidered my offer.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.232
You know the answer to that.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.484
Oh, it's a pity.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.779
We need you on the team.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.281
Had a terrible accident today.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.158
Worker lost a foot.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.871
It seems your agitation
is distracting the crew.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.706
And I am deeply concerned

25:41.748 --> 25:43.583
that unless you back off,

25:43.625 --> 25:46.503
more workers will suffer
the same tragic fate.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.506
Bye for now.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.438
Mom, I've been thinking...

26:08.108 --> 26:11.486
there might be something
we can do to help Charles.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.488
What are you talking about?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.782
How could we help Charles?
It's terminal, Betty.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.743
Maybe not.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.540
Okay, so I'm still
doing research
on Percival's ghost train,

26:23.582 --> 26:26.209
but my friend and I did
chance upon some
pretty damning missives

26:26.251 --> 26:28.878
between my great-uncle
Brayden Blossom

26:28.920 --> 26:31.214
and Percival's
great-grandfather
Paxton Pickens

26:31.256 --> 26:32.716
that should help your cause.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.551
This is about
the miners' strike in '49.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.345
Indeed, some bracing,
shocking stuff.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.139
Do with it as thou wilt.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.353
[crowd applauding]

26:45.395 --> 26:46.563
[Veronica]
All right, who's next?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.566
Who here will be brave enough

26:49.608 --> 26:53.194
to attempt to stump
Forsythe the Fantastic?

26:53.236 --> 26:54.279
Hmm?

26:54.988 --> 26:55.947
You there.

26:55.989 --> 26:56.948
In the pink shirt.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.748
He's doing his act, boss.
Now's your chance.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.041
Thank you, Reggie.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.506
[tense music playing]

27:25.852 --> 27:28.897
[reciting spell in Latin]

27:32.609 --> 27:34.361
[thunderclap]

27:36.279 --> 27:38.281
Forsythe,

27:38.323 --> 27:40.533
what number is this
handsome gentleman
thinking about right now?

27:40.575 --> 27:44.412
[man thinking] Let's see.
Two million, eight hundred

27:44.454 --> 27:47.082
and sixty thousand...

27:47.123 --> 27:49.459
and two hundred and...

27:49.501 --> 27:54.047
[voices overlapping
indistinctly]

27:59.886 --> 28:02.389
[overlapping voices continue]

28:06.393 --> 28:08.061
[woman thinking]
What's going on?

28:08.103 --> 28:09.938
[whispers] Jughead,
what's wrong?

28:09.979 --> 28:11.356
I'm... Uh...

28:11.398 --> 28:13.400
I... I can't...

28:13.441 --> 28:14.901
[overlapping voices continue]

28:24.327 --> 28:26.246
[indistinct overlapping voices]

28:28.039 --> 28:30.166
Jughead. What the hell
happened out there?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.626
Did you choke?

28:31.668 --> 28:34.254
I don't know.
It felt like a tidal wave.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.924
I can hear everyone's thoughts,
and I couldn't shut them out.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.969
I still can't. It feels like
my head's going to explode.

28:41.010 --> 28:45.306
Okay, maybe we just cancel
the rest of our shows tonight.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.599
Right? Let you rest.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.060
Okay, yeah.
I gotta get out of here.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.532
Britta, hey.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.910
Thanks for babysitting
on such short notice.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.329
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

29:08.371 --> 29:11.207
I just can't find
Baby Anthony's
pacifier anywhere.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.084
I'm sure it'll show up.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.419
And how's my little guy doing?

29:14.461 --> 29:16.337
Perfect.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.590
He got so excited when
Mr. Keller came by
to play with him.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.258
Kevin came by?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.260
He said he usually comes by
on Saturdays to visit.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.179
And then the pacifier
went missing?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.598
Yeah.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.016
Is anything wrong, Ms. Topaz?

29:28.057 --> 29:31.394
No. No, no, everything's fine.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.687
Um...

29:32.729 --> 29:34.147
But you should
get home, Britta.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.651
[indistinct overlapping voices]

29:38.693 --> 29:40.528
[woman 1 thinking]
I can't forget to load
all these dishes.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.865
Otherwise we'll be running low
during morning rush tomorrow.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.742
[man 1 thinking] Forty-eight
down seven, minus...

29:45.784 --> 29:47.535
[woman 2 thinking]
Oh, I love that picture.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.121
[man 2 thinking] Mmm.
Best cheeseburgers in town.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.707
[woman 1 thinking] Oh, and I
gotta remember to schedule
that delivery tomorrow.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.417
[voices continue indistinctly]

30:00.465 --> 30:02.091
[sighs] Thanks
for the assist, Vee.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.551
Of course, Bee.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.303
I just hope it works.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.971
What's going on?

30:07.013 --> 30:09.599
Hey, Charles, do you remember
my friend Veronica?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.018
And this is my colleague,
Agent Drake.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.687
Oh. So not my angels of death?

30:14.729 --> 30:16.981
[coughs and groans]

30:17.023 --> 30:20.318
On the contrary, we would
like to try an experimental
medical procedure on you.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.654
Betty...

30:22.695 --> 30:23.738
I'm on the threshold.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.573
No, I know, I know.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.659
And I know this sounds crazy,
so I'm just going to say it.

30:27.700 --> 30:33.331
But we want to hook you up
to Veronica to do
a kind of blood dialysis.

30:33.373 --> 30:37.919
Turns out detoxification
is one of my special skills.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.796
Based on Ms. Lodge's
unique ability

30:39.838 --> 30:43.258
to filter out and process
waste and toxins,

30:43.299 --> 30:45.760
we're hoping that her body
might be able to
purify your blood.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.055
Great.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.224
Could that actually work?

30:51.266 --> 30:52.267
Maybe.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.479
The question is...

30:58.106 --> 31:00.149
do you even want us to try?

31:01.109 --> 31:02.068
The truth is...

31:05.154 --> 31:06.698
I'm terrified of dying, Betty.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.284
For where I might...

31:10.702 --> 31:13.872
end up for all of my sins.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.293
But if there's even
a sliver of a chance...

31:20.879 --> 31:21.796
I want to try.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.467
[upbeat music playing]

31:26.509 --> 31:27.719
What the hell, Toni?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.721
Sit your ass down.
Where is it?

31:29.762 --> 31:31.472
Where is what?

31:31.514 --> 31:32.640
Where is the pacifier?

31:32.682 --> 31:34.225
I don't have a pacifier, Toni.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.060
What were you
trying to do, Kevin?

31:36.102 --> 31:38.021
Steal Anthony's DNA,
so you can prove
you're his father?

31:39.272 --> 31:41.399
You will never be his father.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.568
And I'm not leaving here
without the pacifier.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.986
So where is it?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.154
It's in my jacket pocket.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.495
If you ever come within
ten feet of my baby again,

31:54.537 --> 31:56.164
I will throw you
off this building.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.002
[indistinct overlapping voices]

32:09.010 --> 32:10.678
[voices continue]

32:19.437 --> 32:21.356
[breathing heavily]

32:23.107 --> 32:25.151
[voices continue]

32:27.904 --> 32:33.409
Archie and I, we heard about
what happened to Sal.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.119
And we are so sorry.

32:35.161 --> 32:38.790
We offered to help
with medical expenses.

32:38.831 --> 32:42.418
We also asked if Percival
had called to check in yet.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.129
He hadn't.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.882
[blows raspberry]

32:47.924 --> 32:51.469
Look, Percival
is not a good guy.

32:51.511 --> 32:55.890
And this job,
this railway is not
a good job.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.101
But I've already said
my piece about that.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.602
So we thought we would
read some words

32:59.644 --> 33:01.854
written by Percival's
great-grandfather

33:01.896 --> 33:05.066
after he learned that
the miners voted
to strike in '49.

33:10.738 --> 33:14.993
"These ingrates
must be stopped.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.036
They threaten us
with talk of unions.

33:17.078 --> 33:21.124
They demand fair wages
and compensation,
respect, dignity.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.210
But I tell you, there's
more value in the mules

33:24.252 --> 33:28.339
that carry the palladium
out of our mines
than in these so-called men.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.260
We must break their backs
and remind them of their place,

33:33.219 --> 33:35.888
which is beneath our heels."

33:35.930 --> 33:37.849
His great-grandfather
wrote that?

33:40.184 --> 33:44.022
Make no mistake,
Percival is a tyrant...

33:45.648 --> 33:48.526
which is why
he doesn't want us to unite.

33:48.568 --> 33:52.405
So I guess what I'm asking you
is in your heart of hearts...

33:55.533 --> 33:58.327
what do you want to do now?

33:58.369 --> 34:01.789
Heather, I have
a confession to make.
The library,

34:01.831 --> 34:06.127
though I am very, very glad
that we are doing it...

34:08.463 --> 34:10.715
it was a pretense.

34:10.757 --> 34:14.093
A ruse to get you
to spend more time with me.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.262
You can leave if you want.
I would completely understand,

34:16.304 --> 34:19.682
given the nastiness that is
sure to come with Percival

34:19.724 --> 34:24.937
and the ghost train
and the Maleficarum
and Hecate knows what else.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.357
If it's all the same to you,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.651
I think I'd like to stick
around a while longer.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.593
Serpent jacket, brass knuckles.

34:57.386 --> 35:00.348
Did you get into one last fight
for old time's sake?

35:00.389 --> 35:03.684
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I did.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.978
But there's been
a change of plans.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.146
We're not rebranding.

35:07.855 --> 35:08.898
Why the reversal?

35:08.940 --> 35:11.400
Because denying who we are,

35:11.442 --> 35:13.903
apologizing for who we are,

35:13.945 --> 35:16.656
those are all
signs of weakness.

35:16.697 --> 35:19.408
And we need to be strong,
especially when Kevin
and his team

35:19.450 --> 35:22.328
will sink to any level
to mess with our family.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.329
What did he do?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.874
He made a bold move.

35:26.916 --> 35:30.378
But now the gloves are off,
full steam ahead.

35:30.419 --> 35:35.007
Which is why I think it's time
we induct Baby Anthony
into the Serpents ASAP.

35:35.049 --> 35:40.930
And it's only fitting
that you, as his father,
choose his Serpent name.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.265
Well, I'd be honored to.

35:44.517 --> 35:49.814
And with regards to
your question from before...

35:50.940 --> 35:51.983
earlier...

35:53.609 --> 35:56.320
yes, I'll marry you.

35:56.946 --> 35:57.947
[chuckles]

36:01.617 --> 36:04.579
Sorry, I messed up the plan.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.581
Toni ambushed me
and took the pacifier

36:06.622 --> 36:08.332
before I could
take it to the lab.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.625
[Percival] Don't worry
yourself, Kevin.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.628
By the way...

36:12.670 --> 36:14.422
you aren't Baby Anthony's
biological father.

36:14.463 --> 36:15.464
Fangs is.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.100
How do you know that?

36:27.518 --> 36:29.770
Because I know things, Kevin.

36:29.812 --> 36:33.274
For instance, I know what
that baby represents.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.819
He is Riverdale's
greatest hope.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.529
Its spirit.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.657
Baby Anthony
is the future, Kevin,

36:41.699 --> 36:42.909
which is a problem because...

36:43.910 --> 36:45.536
I too am the future.

36:46.829 --> 36:47.955
And there can be only one.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.632
How's your appetite?

36:59.508 --> 37:01.427
I feel better.

37:03.512 --> 37:06.015
-Thank Veronica for me,
will you?
-Yeah.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.768
And Betty,
thank you for the Hail Mary.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.521
I'll confess something to you.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.399
When I first heard about
your blood poisoning,

37:15.441 --> 37:18.819
I thought maybe Veronica
would be able to
cure you somehow.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.574
But I wasn't sure
that I wanted to go there.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.371
I wasn't sure that you
deserved to be saved.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.333
What made you change your mind?

37:35.586 --> 37:36.545
I did it for Mom.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.341
And because I'm not ready
to give up.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.009
-On me?
-On me.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.598
I can't change the past,
but maybe I should stop
fixating on it

37:47.640 --> 37:48.849
and focus on...

37:50.268 --> 37:52.103
what I'm doing
in the present...

37:53.396 --> 37:54.605
and in my future.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.152
What does that
look like exactly?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.988
I am not sure.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.117
Hopefully catching TBK somehow.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.786
About that...

38:10.705 --> 38:12.915
I think I have an idea
about how you might trap him.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.056
You got my message.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.891
Good.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.351
Where is the rest
of our crew, Archie?

38:33.352 --> 38:34.312
They're not coming.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.190
You see, they asked me
to be their representative.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.818
They took a vote last night.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.819
It was unanimous.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.780
Your crew's
on strike, Percival.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.700
-Is that a fact?
-Yes.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.994
Looks like your railroad's
not going to be
built anytime soon.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.079
Certainly not by
workers in Riverdale.

38:52.121 --> 38:55.207
We'll see how strong
their resolve is
in the face of what's coming.

39:03.299 --> 39:08.554
Mr. Andrews,
you haven't seen
any real fighting yet.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.349
But you will.

39:19.815 --> 39:22.818
Thank you for your help
with Charles.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.612
I know it was risky,

39:24.653 --> 39:29.283
having his contaminated blood
running through your body.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.286
I felt a bit flu-ey afterwards,
but then it was fine.

39:33.579 --> 39:35.456
How are you, Bee?

39:35.498 --> 39:37.833
It's been quite the emotional
roller coaster for you lately.

39:41.420 --> 39:45.091
I mean, I stopped my mom
from making a huge mistake

39:45.132 --> 39:48.260
and we saved Charles's life.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.680
So I feel a bit relieved

39:51.722 --> 39:54.100
and optimistic
about the future.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.184
Okay.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.605
Can I book your casino
for a special event?

39:59.647 --> 40:02.817
A fan convention?

40:02.858 --> 40:04.735
Sure. Fun.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.362
I mean, we have
ample floor space.

40:07.613 --> 40:08.781
Like a Comic-Con?

40:09.865 --> 40:11.659
Sort of.

40:11.700 --> 40:16.539
But it would be a convention
for fans of... serial killers.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.343
Jug?

40:31.554 --> 40:32.930
Jughead, are you home?

40:42.189 --> 40:46.360
[Jughead] "Dear Tabitha,
something is happening to me.

40:46.402 --> 40:49.572
I can't block out
people's voices,
their thoughts.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.241
I've lost control.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.368
I don't know how or why,

40:54.410 --> 40:56.537
but it's too much for me
and I need to get away.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.539
I'm hoping that
if I go someplace quiet

40:58.581 --> 41:02.626
or more importantly, remote,
the voices will calm down,

41:02.668 --> 41:04.587
and I'll be able to
close the door
in my mind again.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.964
That's how it works.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.841
And don't worry,
I'll be in touch soon.

41:09.842 --> 41:10.926
Love, Jughead."

41:13.345 --> 41:15.139
[indistinct overlapping voices]

41:17.725 --> 41:20.811
[man thinking] Everyone comes
back to life...

41:20.853 --> 41:23.063
[woman 1 thinking]
Maybe that's why she brains
him with a hammer.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.815
[woman 2 thinking]
Would you sell your soul
to the devil?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.525
[woman 1 thinking]
And any other force of evil.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.904
[voices continue]

41:32.948 --> 41:35.201
[typewriter clacking]

41:37.578 --> 41:39.455
[voices continue]

41:43.792 --> 41:46.879
[voices grow louder]
