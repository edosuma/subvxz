WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:04.421
Amy: Previously on
"Heartland"...

00:04.462 --> 00:06.631
Georgie: It might be nice
to have some space, you know,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.466
give us a chance to miss
each other a little.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.176
- Right. Okay.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.721
(Camera clicks)

00:12.762 --> 00:13.847
- Adam, hey.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.598
I thought you would be
at the Science Centre.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.392
- And I thought you wanted
space.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.309
I didn't think that meant
ditching me

00:18.351 --> 00:20.311
to hang out with him
for the whole weekend.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.605
- You should get one.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.567
- A horse?
- Yeah, a horse.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.360
What woman lives on a ranch,
doesn't own her own horse?

00:27.402 --> 00:29.654
(Fishing line whips)

00:29.696 --> 00:32.323
Lou, I think you should go.
(Water sloshes)

00:32.365 --> 00:33.575
- What?

00:33.616 --> 00:34.826
- I came up here to be alone

00:34.868 --> 00:37.662
and I don't know why
you can't respect that.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.080
(Chain clinks)

00:41.082 --> 00:43.501
- I'm sorry. This is obviously
a mistake.

00:45.837 --> 00:54.471
**

00:54.512 --> 00:56.264
* Heaven's gates *

00:57.599 --> 01:00.060
* Are behind your eyes *

01:03.438 --> 01:04.772
* Oh, did you know that *

01:06.399 --> 01:09.736
* It's your love,
it's your love *

01:09.778 --> 01:13.281
* It's your love
that keeps me walkin' on *

01:13.323 --> 01:16.451
* It's your love,
it's your love *

01:18.328 --> 01:19.454
(Truck rumbles)

01:26.252 --> 01:27.462
(Bottles clink)

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
- You planning on checking
on the cattle?

01:31.383 --> 01:34.511
- Yup. Mitch and I are headin'
out as soon as he gets here.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.680
- Yeah, where is he, anyway?
He wasn't at the dude ranch.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.432
- Said he had somethin'
he had to do.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.352
- You know, I told Lisa to put
him on a strict schedule.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.104
Shouldn't you be keeping better
tabs on him?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.773
- Don't need to, Lou.
He'll be along.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.609
- Yeah, but he can't just show
up whenever he wants, grandpa.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.695
There are things I need to get
done before I leave
for New York tomorrow.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.614
- Come on, Lou.
He's a good hand.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.282
You're getting plenty
of bang for your buck,

01:56.324 --> 01:58.493
if that's what
you're worried about.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.537
- (Sighs) I know, I'm just
feeling stressed, that's all.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.163
- Ah, you don't say.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.041
- I have a lot of ducks to get
lined up before I take off.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.836
- Chance one of those ducks
is named Peter?

02:07.877 --> 02:09.503
- Don't remind me.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.266
- I'm drawing mommy a special
picture to take with her.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.726
- That's nice.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.561
- Abraham said there's
lots of big apples

02:24.602 --> 02:26.521
where mommy's going.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.690
- (Chuckles) Actually, New York
is called "The Big Apple."

02:28.732 --> 02:30.525
(Phone beeps)

02:32.986 --> 02:35.030
(Sighs)

02:35.071 --> 02:37.449
- What's wrong, Georgie?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.451
- Adam's busy, again.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.828
It's like he's trying
to avoid me.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.539
- But I thought he was
your boyfriend?

02:44.581 --> 02:45.707
- (Sighs heavily)

02:47.584 --> 02:49.210
So did I.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.547
(Truck rumbles)

02:58.803 --> 03:00.472
(Door opens)

03:00.513 --> 03:01.931
- Just who I was looking for.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.476
- Yeah, I, uh, want to talk
to you too.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.937
So, uh, you're, you're
headin' out tomorrow.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.689
Lou: Yeah, just 24 more hours

03:09.731 --> 03:11.941
'til you can start having
50 percent more fun.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.903
- Ouch. You know I didn't mean
that, right?

03:17.072 --> 03:19.157
Lou, about the other day
at the river--

03:19.199 --> 03:20.784
Lou: I don't really have time
for that, Mitch,

03:20.825 --> 03:22.619
and you know what,
neither do you,

03:22.660 --> 03:24.537
because I have a bunch of things
I need done at the dude ranch

03:24.579 --> 03:27.123
if you have time
in your busy schedule.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.333
- What's that supposed to mean?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.210
- None of us knew where
you were this morning, okay?

03:30.251 --> 03:32.587
Grandpa was waiting for you
to go to the summer pasture.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.173
- Uh, you ever hear of one
of these things?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.008
(Door shuts)
I told Jack I was gonna
be late.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.594
It's not like I was
slacking off.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.763
Besides, I got you a surprise.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.266
- For me?
(Latch clanks)

03:46.518 --> 03:48.520
(Taxi rumbles)

03:48.561 --> 03:49.604
(Hooves clop)

03:53.650 --> 03:55.443
- Found you the perfect horse.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.945
Her name's Venus.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.784
- (Grunts)
(Door shuts)

04:04.786 --> 04:08.707
- You don't like her?
- No, no, no, I, I do.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.875
You bought me a horse?

04:15.922 --> 04:18.632
Mitch, she's... beautiful.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.388
Peter.
Peter: Hey.
- Hi.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.598
- Nice lookin' horse.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.808
- Yeah, it's just a horse.
It doesn't matter.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.269
It doesn't mean anything.

04:30.729 --> 04:31.813
- (Bemused chuckle) Okay.
Katie: Daddy!

04:31.855 --> 04:34.024
Peter: Hey hey hey! Aw!

04:34.065 --> 04:35.400
(Grunts with effort)

04:35.442 --> 04:37.861
Oh, it's so good to see you!
Georgie: So glad you're back!

04:37.902 --> 04:39.946
- Mmm, good to see you too!

04:39.988 --> 04:41.239
What are you doin'?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.491
What are you doin'
to get so big, huh?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.996
- He bought me a horse?

04:49.539 --> 04:59.549
**

04:59.549 --> 05:05.138
**

05:05.180 --> 05:09.601
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

05:12.145 --> 05:13.730
* You dreamer *

05:13.772 --> 05:16.149
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

05:16.191 --> 05:17.859
* You dreamer *

05:20.612 --> 05:24.866
* You dreamer *

05:33.833 --> 05:36.127
(Gate clanks)

05:36.169 --> 05:37.587
- Well, what do you think?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.547
Will she do?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.299
- I don't know what to say.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.135
- I, uh, I should get going.
Jack's waitin' on me.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
- Okay.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.139
- But, uh, why, why don't you
take her out while I'm gone?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.642
You know, let me know what
you think,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.144
and then maybe when
I get back, um...

05:53.186 --> 05:54.562
(Gate clanks)

05:54.604 --> 05:57.148
maybe we can talk.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.859
- Talk? Yeah. I think that's...

05:59.901 --> 06:02.487
that's a really good idea.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.364
- Great.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.582
(Door opens and closes)

06:14.624 --> 06:16.084
- What was all that about?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.752
- What was all what about?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.337
- Out front with that Mitch guy.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.047
- Nothing. I was just going
over things I want done

06:21.089 --> 06:24.384
at the dude ranch
while I'm gone.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.636
Hey, Peter, you know,
we should probably talk

06:26.678 --> 06:29.014
about some things
at some point.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.142
- Sure. Talk right now.
(Door shuts)

06:32.183 --> 06:34.060
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey! Whoa, look at you!

06:34.102 --> 06:36.187
Holy smokes!

06:36.229 --> 06:37.522
- Yeah. (Sighs tiredly)
- How're ya feelin'?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.733
- Great, actually,
except that I'm always hungry.
- Amy--

06:39.774 --> 06:41.860
- Lou, where are those muffins
you made that--

06:41.901 --> 06:43.945
- You, you ate the last one
this morning.
- Are you sure?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.071
Lou: Uh huh.
Amy: You're kidding me.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.781
Lou: Hey, Peter, are you okay
here for a minute?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.408
I just need to talk
to Amy for a sec.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.036
- Yeah, yeah, I got this.
- Just about pregnancy stuff.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.537
- Okay.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.002
- He bought you a horse?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.755
- I know, right? It's crazy!

07:01.796 --> 07:04.382
- Where is this coming from?
- Mitch and I were talking

07:04.424 --> 07:06.634
and he said he doesn't get
how I can live on a ranch

07:06.676 --> 07:08.345
and not own a horse of my own.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.722
- So, what, you asked him
to buy you one?

07:10.764 --> 07:13.016
- No, Amy, of course not. I...

07:13.058 --> 07:15.143
I think it's sort
of an apology.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.020
- What for?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.731
- Mitch was being a real jerk
at the river the other day.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.734
I think this is his way
of making up for it.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.278
- I don't know. Seems like
an awfully big apology.
(Gate clanks)

07:25.320 --> 07:28.031
Lou: Well, he's obviously
trying to send me a message.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.033
I mean, her name is Venus,
right?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.118
The Goddess of Love.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.246
What do you think I should do?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.166
- Well, if you have time,

07:38.208 --> 07:41.628
I think that we should see
if you two are a match.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.463
I'm talking about you
and the horse.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.675
- You want something else,
honey?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.677
- No, no, I'm just not hungry.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.682
- Everything all right?
- Georgie has boy problems.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.102
- You have ballet.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.312
Why don't you go and get
yourself ready okay, please?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.731
- Okay.
- Thanks, honey.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.024
(Receding footsteps)

08:06.653 --> 08:07.862
- Is that true?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.199
- No, uh, it's nothing.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.619
- I'm guessing it's about Adam.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.081
- Yeah. We're not really
talking.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.083
I think I kinda
messed things up.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.169
- What happened?

08:23.211 --> 08:25.171
- Well, I asked for space
and he gave it to me

08:25.213 --> 08:27.298
and now I haven't
seen him in days.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.175
- Needing space is not
a bad thing.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.927
- Yeah, but now I really
miss him.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.054
I, I wish I hadn't
said anything.

08:34.389 --> 08:38.476
Maybe I'm just not good
at relationships.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.979
- You were honest with him.
You told him what you needed.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.772
That's...

08:42.813 --> 08:43.898
You did the right thing,
sweetheart.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.316
There's nothing wrong
with that.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.198
You're wondering about taking
relationship advice from me.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.035
- No, no.
- Well, I don't blame you.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.080
I tell you what I do know,

08:59.122 --> 09:00.915
is that there is no magic
formula

09:00.957 --> 09:03.293
for making a relationship work.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.129
There isn't,

09:06.171 --> 09:09.841
but just talking helps.
- But he's avoiding me.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.469
He doesn't ever want to come
over or be around me.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.930
- Well, then you just find a
way to get yourself around him.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.854
- You have to admit,
it's pretty flattering, right?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.774
I mean, Mitch obviously kept
thinking about our conversation.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.858
He said I needed a horse,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.194
so he went out and did
something about it.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.238
I'm sorry. You know, I just
keep going on and on about me

09:32.280 --> 09:33.782
when I should be...

09:35.075 --> 09:37.160
Oh my God! I completely forgot.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.913
Today was your mid-term
ultrasound, right?!

09:39.954 --> 09:42.415
So? Am I getting
a niece or nephew?

09:42.457 --> 09:45.293
- I didn't ask.
- Why not?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.879
- 'Cause I'm not sure
I want to know.
- O-kay.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.881
Well, you might want
to reconsider that, Amy,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.884
because knowing ahead of time
makes planning a lot easier.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.260
And, hey, did you look
at that link I sent you

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
for the prenatal class?
- No, not yet.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.972
- Amy!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.057
You're gonna have to do that,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.059
'cause Margo's classes
fill up really fast.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.977
Amy: Okay, Lou, enough!
(Venus snorts loudly)

10:03.019 --> 10:06.398
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(Hard thud)
Amy: Lou!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.733
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.237
But I have no idea
What just happened!

10:17.367 --> 10:19.285
Jack and Mitch: Yip! Yip!

10:20.829 --> 10:22.831
Mitch: (Clicks tongue) Ha!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.126
- You know, I've been meanin'
to clear the air

10:26.167 --> 10:27.293
about somethin' Tim said.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.923
- Tim's had a lot to say, but
I assume you're talkin' about

10:31.965 --> 10:34.175
how he figures I'm using
Georgie to get close to Lou?

10:34.217 --> 10:36.094
- Well, I want you to know
I never agreed

10:36.136 --> 10:37.887
eith Tim's take on that.

10:37.929 --> 10:38.930
- I'm glad to hear you say that,
Jack,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.306
because there's nothin' to it.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.142
Georgie, she's just a good kid.
Period.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.352
- Well, I have to agree
with you on that.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.149
- But?
- Well, I'm just gonna
come out and ask ya:

10:49.190 --> 10:51.651
is there somethin' goin'
on between you and Lou?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.238
Now if you said to me
it's none of my business,

10:55.280 --> 10:57.365
you'd be right.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.035
- Lou's an amazing woman
and I...

11:00.076 --> 11:03.538
I can't deny that there
was something there, but...

11:03.580 --> 11:05.123
it's all in the past.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.416
It's too complicated.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.544
- Huh, ain't that the truth.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.087
(Birds caw loudly)

11:11.129 --> 11:13.131
Mitch: What do you think
that's about?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.215
- I don't know.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.385
(Clicks tongue) Get up.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.849
- Who's this? I saw Mitch
drop her off.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.059
- Her name's Venus.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.976
- Yeah, Mitch thought I was
looking for a horse

11:25.018 --> 11:28.855
so he dropped her off
for me to check out.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.273
- That's cool. So, are you?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.233
- Am I what?

11:32.275 --> 11:35.403
- Looking for a horse?
- Oh, no, I'm not.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.197
Maybe.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.616
I don't know. I'm not sure.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.534
- Well, is there something
wrong with her?

11:41.576 --> 11:44.621
- I tried riding her...
- She was just really skittish.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.581
- Well, it's not because
she's in any pain.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.416
She checks out medically.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.669
There must be somethin' else
going on with her.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.379
I guess that's where
you come in.
- (Chuckles)

11:52.420 --> 11:54.130
- She seems pretty calm now.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.049
Lou: Yeah, she does,
doesn't she?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.133
Amy: Well, thanks for coming,
Scott.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.010
I just wanted to rule out
anything physical first.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.220
Scott: Ah, no problem.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.181
I was on my way to
the wildlife reserve anyway.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.724
- Is one of the animals sick?

12:04.766 --> 12:08.019
- No, I'm just keepin' an eye
on the place for Bob.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.396
- I thought that Bob had a guy
looking after things

12:09.437 --> 12:10.480
while he was away.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.358
- Well, he did, but the guy
flaked off so--

12:13.400 --> 12:14.776
- You know, I might be able
to help.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.611
I volunteer at the wildlife
reserve sometimes,

12:16.653 --> 12:19.447
you know, help feed,
water the animals.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.034
Actually, I, I might be able
to have someone tag along.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.494
Scott: Well, that sounds great.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.329
Uh, if you're free
I'll be there this afternoon.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.289
- Can I?
- It's fine by me.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.000
- Thanks, Scott.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.460
- Yeah. Guess we'll see
ya later. See ya.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.302
(Buttons click on phone)

12:49.227 --> 12:50.603
Mitch: Hep! Ha!
(Clicks tongue)

12:50.645 --> 12:52.605
(Cows moo)

12:52.647 --> 12:54.399
Jack: Get over! Get over!
(Cows moo)

12:54.441 --> 12:56.359
- Hey!

12:56.401 --> 13:01.573
**

13:01.614 --> 13:04.159
Is that a calf?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.369
- Yeah, what's left of one,
anyway.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.996
(Flies buzz)

13:08.038 --> 13:09.122
- What do you think did that?

13:09.164 --> 13:11.541
- Well, I've been hearin'
that coyote attacks

13:11.583 --> 13:13.043
are up in the area.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.961
That's why I came prepared.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.549
(Sighs) Damn it.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.009
(Flies buzz)

13:32.604 --> 13:34.356
- Hey, dad, can I get a ride?!

13:36.441 --> 13:38.860
(Hooves thud)
- (Clicks tongue)

13:42.197 --> 13:44.282
(Clicks tongue)
(Hooves thud)

13:46.368 --> 13:47.744
- How's it goin'?

13:47.786 --> 13:51.206
- Good. She seems focused
and relaxed now.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.499
Whoa. Good girl.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
I think it's time you two
gave it another try.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.879
You up for it?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.592
(Llama bleats)

14:02.634 --> 14:08.640
**

14:08.682 --> 14:11.226
(Car turns off)
(Keys clink)

14:11.267 --> 14:13.436
Peter: I'm impressed.
You're a really good driver.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.397
- Thanks, dad.
(Doors open)

14:17.774 --> 14:19.484
- Hey!
(Doors shut)

14:19.526 --> 14:22.153
Adam: Hello, Mr. Morris.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.321
- Hey.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.490
Peter: Oh, Scott.
- Peter.
- How are ya?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.367
- Very good.
- All right.
- Thank you for comin'.

14:27.409 --> 14:30.245
- Yeah, absolutely.
They're all yours.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.247
- Let's go, guys.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.084
(Pig snorts)

14:36.126 --> 14:38.128
- This is Petunia.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.754
- A pot-bellied pig?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.673
- She's adorable!

14:41.715 --> 14:43.800
- Yeah, she just arrived
an hour ago.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.094
I haven't even had a chance
to examine her yet.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.345
- Is she friendly?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.973
- Oh yeah. She is a family pet.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.516
- Seriously?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.351
- Apparently, her former family

14:53.393 --> 14:56.396
even used that leash
to take her for walks.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.148
- How can someone
give up their pet?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.858
- They had to move away.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.319
They tried to look for a new
home, but they ran out of time.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.363
- That's so sad.
(Pig snorts)

15:07.323 --> 15:10.368
(Cows moo)
Jack: Keep 'em comin'!
Mitch: All right!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.661
(Clicks tongue) Come on!

15:11.703 --> 15:13.288
(Calf moans)

15:13.329 --> 15:16.791
Jack: This calf's had somethin'
nipping at his heels!
(Cows moo)

15:16.833 --> 15:19.294
- Hey, Jack!
(Cows moo)

15:19.336 --> 15:21.212
Come here!

15:21.254 --> 15:22.297
(Hooves thud)

15:23.590 --> 15:25.300
(Cows moo)

15:26.718 --> 15:29.554
- Yeah, this one wasn't
so lucky.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.431
Mitch: Coyotes are pretty
territorial.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.475
Jack: It actually could be
wolves from the look of that.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.187
Mitch: What's the plan?

15:37.228 --> 15:40.065
Jack: Well, there's no choice.
(Gun clicks)

15:40.106 --> 15:42.317
Get rid of 'em.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.485
Let's go.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.909
Scott: Okay, I'll leave now.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.869
See you soon.
(Door shuts)

15:52.911 --> 15:55.538
Sorry, guys, I gotta go.
- What's up?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.916
- I gotta make a field call.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.834
I might be gone a while.
You guys'll be okay?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.836
- We've worked here
on our own before.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.505
- Well, you won't be able
to reach me,

16:03.546 --> 16:05.423
so if anything comes up...
(Keys clink)

16:05.465 --> 16:06.716
you can use the phone
in the cabin

16:06.758 --> 16:08.176
to call Cass at the clinic.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.054
(Keys clink)
(Animals mew)

16:11.096 --> 16:13.765
- Pretty cool we get to work
here for the afternoon
on our own.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.308
- We should get to work.

16:15.350 --> 16:25.443
**

16:25.485 --> 16:27.570
- You two got off
to a rough start,

16:27.612 --> 16:29.823
but it looks like you're
starting to build a bond.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.534
- (Chuckles)
- What's so funny?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.619
- Well, it's like me and Mitch.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.288
Talk about a rough start,

16:37.330 --> 16:39.249
but I guess now he's having
second thoughts.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.417
- And what about you?

16:40.458 --> 16:42.127
I thought you wanted to be
on your own for a bit.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.087
- Yeah, so did I, but...

16:44.129 --> 16:46.589
now I'm not so sure.

16:46.631 --> 16:50.468
- I get it. It's like Ty.
I told him to go

16:50.510 --> 16:51.803
and now I'm really missing him.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.722
It gets a little bit harder
every day.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.765
- Honestly, I don't know why
you agreed

16:55.807 --> 16:57.851
to this whole Mongolia thing
in the first place.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.228
- It's better now than later,
right?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.313
This part I can handle
on my own,

17:02.355 --> 17:03.940
but once the baby comes

17:03.982 --> 17:05.817
that's gonna be a whole
different story.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.278
- How are you doing with that
baby book I gave you?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.487
- My reading's kinda
fallen off.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.321
- Well pick it up again, Amy!

17:11.364 --> 17:13.324
Knowing what's going on in your
own body will help you feel

17:13.366 --> 17:14.909
more confident and in control.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.369
- Yeah, maybe knowing what's
going on in your own brain

17:17.412 --> 17:19.664
will help you feel more
confident and in control.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.458
- Yeah, you're right.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.460
I have my own mess to sort out.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.377
Hey, Venus?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.255
- Well, you two are fine
on the ground,

17:27.297 --> 17:29.424
let's get you in the saddle.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!
- (Chuckles) Okay.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.803
- I read that pigs
are really smart.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.889
- Yeah. I think they're
the fourth

17:35.930 --> 17:39.059
smartest animal group
on the planet.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.606
- Do you think she misses
her human family?

17:44.647 --> 17:46.524
- Yeah. Pot-bellies
are affectionate.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.526
They get pretty attached,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.695
and despite appearances,

17:50.737 --> 17:53.656
they're actually really clean.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.575
- Adam, look, okay--

17:55.617 --> 17:58.453
-The llamas are next.
We should go.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.631
- Careful or you'll get covered
in spit again.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.840
- Don't remind me.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.092
(Llamas mew)

18:13.385 --> 18:15.720
- I know you've been
avoiding me.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.472
- Just trying to give
you some space.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.352
- I'm sorry about the whole
archery thing.

18:22.394 --> 18:25.397
- It's just... we had plans.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.023
You said you wanted to go

18:27.065 --> 18:28.900
and then you bailed
at the last minute.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.194
That hurt my feelings.

18:31.236 --> 18:34.406
- Believe it or not I was
actually trying not
to hurt your feelings.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.949
- I know we don't like
all the same things.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.534
I'm sure if you didn't see
the inside

18:37.575 --> 18:39.786
of a science centre again
you'd be okay with that.

18:39.828 --> 18:43.707
- Yeah, and you just don't want
to start trick riding,

18:43.748 --> 18:46.876
but isn't it okay if we do
our own things

18:46.918 --> 18:49.129
and still do a lot of other
stuff together?

18:49.170 --> 18:52.382
I really miss hanging out
with you.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.010
- What about that Clay guy?

18:55.051 --> 18:57.470
- He was just there dropping
stuff off!

18:57.512 --> 18:58.847
He saw the archery
and wanted to try it.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.724
It was all about Jade anyway!

19:00.765 --> 19:03.601
He even stopped to take
a stupid selfie for her.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.689
So, are we okay?

19:14.946 --> 19:17.615
- Yeah, we're fine.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.036
So what mutually agreed upon
shared activity

19:21.077 --> 19:22.787
do you feel like doing now?

19:22.829 --> 19:26.416
- Do you want to go take
Petunia for a walk?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.209
- (Chuckles)

19:29.669 --> 19:30.879
Yeah, let's go.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.385
- This is a good spot to keep
an eye out for 'em.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.557
(Foliage rustles underfoot)

19:45.477 --> 19:46.478
I'm gonna head down
to these trees

19:46.519 --> 19:48.813
and I'll call 'em from there.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.690
- You can make predator calls?

19:50.732 --> 19:53.568
- I'm not bad if I do
say so myself.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.944
- Well, let's see whatcha got.

19:54.986 --> 19:55.987
(Gun clatters)

19:56.029 --> 19:58.615
- Just be ready.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.201
(Truck rumbles)
- (Exhales nervously)

20:01.242 --> 20:03.912
- Okay, how are you feelin'?
- So far so good.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.663
- (Chuckles)
(Door shuts)

20:05.705 --> 20:08.124
- Hey, Lou?
- Hey.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.544
- Just headin' into town
to pick up Katie soon, but uh...

20:11.586 --> 20:13.838
I got a couple minutes now
if you want to talk.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.257
- Now? I, I, I can't 'cause...

20:17.676 --> 20:20.720
Amy needs help with this horse.
- (Sighs)

20:20.762 --> 20:22.263
- Okay. Later it is.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.934
- (Whispers) I know!
I panicked!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.769
(Truck door opens and closes)

20:27.811 --> 20:29.229
- All right.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.439
(Truck starts up)
Let's give this a try.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.777
(Hooves thud)
(Truck rumbles)

20:37.028 --> 20:39.197
Just go easy.
(Clicks tongue)

20:39.239 --> 20:40.907
- Whoa!
Amy: Lou, slow down!

20:40.949 --> 20:43.576
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Venus, stop!

20:43.618 --> 20:45.578
Whoa!
- Whoa.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.914
Lou: Whoa! Whoa!
Amy: Lou, hey!

20:49.582 --> 20:50.750
- Okay, that's it!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.627
Venus clearly has
a problem with me!

20:52.669 --> 20:53.837
Maybe it's a sign!

20:53.878 --> 20:54.921
- A sign? What kind of sign?

20:54.963 --> 20:56.965
- Well obviously we're not
a good match, Amy,

20:57.007 --> 20:57.924
so maybe Mitch and I aren't
either!

20:57.966 --> 21:00.051
- This is not about
you and Mitch, Lou!

21:00.093 --> 21:01.720
This is about you and the horse!

21:01.761 --> 21:03.013
You guys just need time!

21:03.054 --> 21:05.098
- You know what, Amy,
we don't all have time like you

21:05.140 --> 21:07.100
to just sit back and watch
how the world unfolds!

21:07.142 --> 21:09.602
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about
your pregnancy!

21:09.644 --> 21:11.229
- Oh don't turn this around
on me!
- No, no, no!

21:11.271 --> 21:14.024
Amy, you are not the least bit
prepared!
- No, Lou, stop!

21:14.065 --> 21:16.234
- Do you even have a birth plan?
- No. I don't know.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.236
I was thinking maybe I'd give
birth at home.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.197
- Amy, you can't give birth
in a barn! Are you crazy?!

21:21.239 --> 21:22.365
Do you know what I would
have given

21:22.407 --> 21:23.950
to have been in a hospital
when Katie was born?!

21:23.992 --> 21:25.618
- I'm the one having the baby,
okay,

21:25.660 --> 21:26.911
so this decision
is mine and Ty's!

21:26.953 --> 21:28.329
- Yeah, that's right.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.707
That requires you to actually
make a decision though, Amy,

21:30.749 --> 21:33.043
and so far, I'm shocked
by how few you've made!

21:33.084 --> 21:34.836
- Maybe I haven't made enough
decisions,

21:34.878 --> 21:36.671
but neither have you!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.262
(Pig snorts and wheezes)
Georgie: I don't get.
Why didn't she eat?

21:44.304 --> 21:46.556
Adam: I don't know.
Pigs have big appetites.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.557
It's weird.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.894
- Whoa. What's up with
her breathing?

21:50.935 --> 21:52.979
- Not sure.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.606
She doesn't look very good.
Something's definitely wrong.
(Pig wheezes and strains)

21:54.647 --> 21:56.691
Georgie: I'll, I'll call Cass!

21:56.733 --> 21:57.984
(Phone beeps)

22:01.279 --> 22:03.823
Cass, hi it's Georgie.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.618
We've got a pig at the reserve
here and we think she's sick.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.119
She's not eating
and her breathing's all off.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.788
She's really wheezing.

22:09.829 --> 22:10.789
(Pig wheezes and snorts)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.707
Okay, well how fast
can you get here?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.170
Okay. Okay, yeah, we'll get
her there as soon as possible.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.963
Thanks. Bye.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.925
Cass thinks Petunia might
have swallowed something
and it got stuck.

22:21.966 --> 22:25.011
- So why isn't she coming?
- She can't. She's got surgery!

22:25.053 --> 22:26.930
(Pig wheezes and strains)
She says she could be
in a lot of pain.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.598
She could even die!

22:28.640 --> 22:30.558
We need to get Petunia
to the clinic now!

22:30.600 --> 22:31.810
- How?

22:31.851 --> 22:34.104
- Um...

22:34.145 --> 22:36.773
Bob's truck! The keys are
in the cabin.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.650
I'll drive.

22:38.692 --> 22:39.484
- You only have your Learner's!

22:39.526 --> 22:41.069
- I know I only have
my Learner's,

22:41.111 --> 22:43.655
but the clinic isn't that far!

22:44.948 --> 22:46.825
(Metallic clank)
Where are the cabin keys?!

22:46.866 --> 22:49.828
Last time I had them was
when we fed Petunia.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.746
What if they fell into her pen?

22:53.832 --> 22:56.084
What if she swallowed them?

22:56.126 --> 22:57.669
Oh my God!

22:57.711 --> 22:59.421
Petunia's sick because of me.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.514
- No one is answering!

23:13.727 --> 23:15.937
It's up to us.
We've gotta do this.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.566
Adam: What are you doing?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.112
Georgie?
(Window rattles)

23:28.908 --> 23:29.784
Georgie!

23:32.078 --> 23:33.788
- (Sighs)

23:37.208 --> 23:38.460
(Keys clink)

23:40.211 --> 23:41.796
(Door opens)

23:43.381 --> 23:45.717
- Got 'em. Let's go!
(Door shuts)

23:48.762 --> 23:50.638
(Pig squeals)

23:50.680 --> 23:52.724
You okay? She looks heavy.

23:52.766 --> 23:53.975
- Don't worry I got it.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.977
Open the tailgate.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.772
No, no! What are you doing?!
She's sick!

23:58.813 --> 24:01.191
Put her in the front with me.
Come on!

24:01.232 --> 24:02.817
- Okay.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.155
- It's okay.
- You got it?

24:07.197 --> 24:08.406
- Yeah, I got her.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.991
Just get in.
(Pig squeals)

24:10.033 --> 24:11.826
I know.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.499
(Door shuts)

24:18.833 --> 24:20.126
(Truck starts up)

24:21.294 --> 24:22.837
(Pig squeals)

24:24.422 --> 24:26.132
(Tires crunch on gravel)

24:28.968 --> 24:31.262
- Hey.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.931
- Hey.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.935
What's that?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.229
- Peace offering.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.773
- You made more?

24:41.815 --> 24:42.857
(Gate clanks)

24:44.818 --> 24:45.860
(Chuckles)

24:49.906 --> 24:51.783
- These are a healthier version.
I used maple syrup instead of
sugar--

24:51.825 --> 24:53.868
- Oh, Lou, just let me enjoy
this, please.

24:56.079 --> 24:59.165
- I shouldn't have blown up
at you like that,

24:59.207 --> 25:01.876
but you do need to get better
prepared, Amy.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.378
- I know.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.131
I'm just not as excited about
doing baby stuff without Ty.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.883
- And I get that, but I worry.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.927
You know, pregnancy
is a crap shoot,

25:10.969 --> 25:12.762
and the more that you can do
when you're up to it

25:12.804 --> 25:15.473
the better.

25:15.515 --> 25:19.019
And really, I'm just sorry that
I'm not here to help out more.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.104
- Hey, mmm mmm. You've got
a lot going on yourself.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.105
- Yeah.

25:22.147 --> 25:22.772
You know, I still haven't
told Peter

25:22.814 --> 25:25.483
about this new Maggie's deal.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.987
This Mitch thing has really
thrown me off.

25:30.238 --> 25:34.200
Georgie asked me if I want this
horse, and I think I do.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.246
Ach, you're right,
my head's a mess.

25:38.288 --> 25:41.166
- Honestly? I think that's
why you're not connecting
with Venus.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.710
- Come on, Amy.
- No, I do.

25:45.045 --> 25:49.299
- Well, a big part of me does
want to see where things
go with Mitch,

25:49.341 --> 25:53.094
but I'm leaving again, and I
have the girls to think about,

25:53.136 --> 25:55.305
and grandpa, he likes having
Mitch around.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.890
So what if it doesn't work out
between us?

25:56.931 --> 25:59.142
- See there's your head
talking again.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.852
Maybe you should listen
to your heart.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.774
(Truck rumbles)

26:07.942 --> 26:09.569
- We'll only take
the back roads, promise.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.030
- There are no back roads
in Hudson!

26:12.072 --> 26:14.032
- It'll be okay.
I drove here today.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.284
My dad said I was a good driver.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.120
(Pig squeals quietly)

26:20.246 --> 26:21.831
(Truck rumbles)

26:21.873 --> 26:29.089
**

26:29.130 --> 26:30.924
(Birds chirp)
(Grass rustles)

26:37.263 --> 26:38.306
(Thunder rumbles)

26:40.809 --> 26:42.602
- (Squeaking sounds)

26:46.106 --> 26:47.273
(Birds chirp)

26:50.819 --> 26:52.112
(Thunder rumbles)

26:53.279 --> 26:55.156
(Squeaking sounds)

27:02.163 --> 27:05.208
(Whispers) Stay ready!
(Menacing growl)

27:05.250 --> 27:07.002
(Vicious growl)
(Gun clicks)

27:09.462 --> 27:11.923
(Vicious growl)

27:16.136 --> 27:17.303
(Vicious growl)

27:22.559 --> 27:23.268
(Low menacing growl)

27:23.309 --> 27:25.186
(Vicious growl)

27:26.938 --> 27:28.940
Jack: (Whispers loudly)
Shoot him!

27:28.982 --> 27:31.860
(Vicious growl)
- (Heavy breathing)

27:31.901 --> 27:33.695
Jack: Come on, Mitch!

27:36.322 --> 27:38.033
(Thunder booms)

27:40.076 --> 27:42.370
(Shaky breathing)

27:46.583 --> 27:48.209
(Thunder rumbles)

27:54.841 --> 27:56.134
(Grass rustles)

27:57.677 --> 28:01.264
What the hell?!
He was standin' right there!

28:01.306 --> 28:03.224
- I know. I...

28:03.266 --> 28:05.977
I'm sorry, Jack. I just...

28:06.019 --> 28:08.146
I just, I froze.
- Yeah, no kiddin'.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.648
(Gun clatters)

28:10.690 --> 28:14.027
- Thing is I haven't touched
a gun since Afghanistan.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.238
- Yeah, well...

28:18.573 --> 28:19.532
It's probably for the best.

28:19.574 --> 28:23.703
Georgie wouldn't have
forgiven me, so...

28:26.289 --> 28:28.333
What happened over there?

28:30.460 --> 28:33.380
- Uh, Zack and I,
we served together.

28:35.507 --> 28:38.635
- Zack? You've mentioned him.
Your cousin.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.762
- Well, he's more like
a brother, really.

28:43.098 --> 28:45.850
- I take it he didn't
make it back.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.519
- No, he did.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.937
(Horse whinnies)

28:48.978 --> 28:50.438
But um...

28:52.232 --> 28:53.858
- What happened?

28:55.276 --> 28:57.237
- He shot himself.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.288
(Truck rumbles)

29:11.584 --> 29:13.336
(Pig wheezes)
- See? I told you it'd be fine.

29:13.378 --> 29:19.467
**

29:19.509 --> 29:23.138
- Oh, no, no, that's my dad!
It's a roadblock!

29:26.683 --> 29:28.476
- Come on in. Right here.

29:32.647 --> 29:35.483
Well, look who it is.
License please.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.904
- Hey! How was ballet?

29:41.031 --> 29:43.033
- It was awesome!

29:43.074 --> 29:44.909
Peter: Apparently the best.

29:47.078 --> 29:48.955
Oh, my gosh.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.208
I can't believe these actually
fit Katie.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.753
Look at how small they are.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.671
- Yeah, Amy hasn't really
bought anything for the baby

29:56.713 --> 30:01.801
so I was gonna give them to her
if you're okay with that?

30:01.843 --> 30:05.221
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
Whatever, whatever she needs.

30:05.263 --> 30:08.308
- You know, I actually have
some exciting news.

30:08.350 --> 30:12.562
Uh, this whole Maggie's thing,
it's really taking off,

30:12.604 --> 30:14.939
and the investors want
to open more locations.

30:16.649 --> 30:19.736
- Wow, that's... that's a big
undertaking.

30:19.778 --> 30:23.615
- Yeah, it is, and Nicole and I
are seriously considering it,

30:23.656 --> 30:28.119
but it would mean I would have
to be away more than I planned.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.038
- How much more?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.831
- I'm not sure,

30:31.873 --> 30:35.752
but if I did it you would have
to spend more time at Heartland.

30:35.794 --> 30:37.879
- (Bemused sigh)
- What?

30:39.172 --> 30:41.049
- Nothing it's just, uh,

30:42.342 --> 30:45.595
it's just what you've always
criticized me for -

30:45.637 --> 30:47.430
putting work before family.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.557
It's what you said blew up
our marriage.

30:49.599 --> 30:51.184
- Okay, well that's one way
of looking at it.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.602
- No, it's the only way
of looking at it, Lou.

30:52.644 --> 30:55.647
Why's it suddenly okay
for you to do it?

30:55.689 --> 30:56.731
It's just a little hypocritical
that's all.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.567
- Peter, who stood behind you
all those years?

30:59.609 --> 31:02.070
Katie: Daddy, I need you!

31:10.870 --> 31:13.707
- Well, this is a first.
(Pig squeals)

31:13.748 --> 31:16.292
- Look, dad...
- I can explain!

31:16.334 --> 31:20.255
- I hope so. Aren't you supposed
to be at the reserve?

31:21.715 --> 31:23.508
You only have your Learner's?

31:23.550 --> 31:25.260
Okay, you two
out of the car now!

31:25.301 --> 31:26.594
- We were on our way
to the vet clinic!

31:26.636 --> 31:28.304
- There is no excuse for you
to be driving

31:28.346 --> 31:30.390
Without a licensed driver
present.

31:30.432 --> 31:32.350
It's illegal.
You know that, right?

31:32.392 --> 31:35.103
- I do, but Petunia
swallowed keys!

31:35.145 --> 31:37.272
- Yeah, she's really sick.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.606
(Pig squeals)

31:38.648 --> 31:40.108
- You mean the pig?

31:41.526 --> 31:44.404
- We called for a ride,
but nobody picked up.

31:44.446 --> 31:46.656
- And this is the best plan
you two could come up with?

31:46.698 --> 31:50.243
- No, don't blame Adam!
This was my idea!

31:50.285 --> 31:53.496
- Look, I know it looks bad and
I'll face the consequences...

31:53.538 --> 31:56.374
- But we have to get her to
a vet clinic! She could die!

31:56.416 --> 31:57.959
Please!

32:00.378 --> 32:01.755
- Let's go.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.048
(Door shuts)

32:04.382 --> 32:06.384
(Mutter police radio chatter)
(Door shuts)

32:06.426 --> 32:08.636
(Car starts up)

32:10.430 --> 32:12.640
- (Pig snorts)

32:18.396 --> 32:19.606
(Knock at the door)

32:19.647 --> 32:22.567
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.611
Peter: Listen, I'm sorry, okay?

32:24.652 --> 32:26.237
It's a fantastic opportunity

32:26.279 --> 32:30.700
and of course you should do it
and I will step up.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.577
- Thank you.

32:32.619 --> 32:33.953
- Our marriage may have failed,

32:33.995 --> 32:35.580
but I'm not gonna fail
at being the best dad

32:35.622 --> 32:38.208
I can possibly be for our girls.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.502
- That means a lot.

32:42.504 --> 32:45.965
And I'm excited, but I'm also
worried about being away more.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.594
I honestly don't know how
I'm gonna juggle it.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.514
- No, you'll figure it out,
you...

32:52.555 --> 32:53.890
And I'm here.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.642
I'll be here to support you,
you know, whatever you need,

32:55.684 --> 32:57.143
you and the girls.

32:59.396 --> 33:03.483
There is something I've been
meaning to ask you. Uh...

33:03.525 --> 33:06.736
It's been sorta kicking around
in my head a little bit.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.029
Um...

33:11.908 --> 33:14.619
What's really going on with you
and this ranch hand?

33:19.666 --> 33:23.503
- It's nothing official,
but things have changed.

33:25.755 --> 33:26.923
There's something between us

33:26.965 --> 33:29.217
and I want to see where it goes.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.221
I'm sorry, Peter, I'm not
telling you to hurt you.

33:33.263 --> 33:35.223
I just want to be honest.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.229
- No, yeah, that's uh...

33:42.689 --> 33:44.733
I hope that works out for you
if that's what you want.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.406
(Receding footsteps)

33:53.283 --> 33:54.743
(Birds chirp)

33:58.329 --> 34:00.206
(Paper CD case crinkles)

34:01.583 --> 34:04.836
(Approaching footsteps)
Lou: Incoming!

34:04.878 --> 34:06.838
- Hey.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.130
What do you got there?

34:08.172 --> 34:11.384
Lou: Ah, just some
of Katie's old clothes.
- Oh.

34:11.426 --> 34:13.969
Oh, Lou, they're adorable.

34:14.012 --> 34:15.804
Are you giving these to me?

34:15.847 --> 34:18.475
- I've been saving them for
you, and it's a good thing too,

34:18.516 --> 34:20.893
or else my niece or nephew might
not have anything to wear.

34:20.935 --> 34:24.438
- Very funny. Actually,
you'll be happy to know

34:24.481 --> 34:26.315
I just signed up for that
prenatal class you told
me about.

34:26.358 --> 34:27.317
- Amy, that's great.

34:27.359 --> 34:29.652
You're gonna love Margo.
She's the best.

34:29.694 --> 34:30.779
- Yeah, yeah...

34:32.447 --> 34:33.447
It's just I don't...

34:33.489 --> 34:35.824
I don't have a prenatal partner
right now.

34:35.867 --> 34:38.911
So I was hoping maybe
if you had time...

34:38.953 --> 34:41.289
- Yes! Yes, Amy,
I would love that!

34:42.581 --> 34:43.917
And I will do everything I can

34:43.958 --> 34:45.793
to make sure I'm here
to make that happen.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.253
- Thanks, Lou.

34:48.588 --> 34:51.341
- Oh my gosh,
I remember this one.

34:51.382 --> 34:54.177
- Wow, that it so tiny.
(Laughing)

34:54.219 --> 34:55.804
- It is.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.555
- (Sighs)

34:57.597 --> 34:59.641
You seem more relaxed.

34:59.683 --> 35:03.937
- Um, well I told Peter
about the expansion plans,

35:03.978 --> 35:07.315
and then he came right out
and asked me about Mitch.

35:07.357 --> 35:08.566
- What did you say?

35:08.608 --> 35:10.902
- I admitted there's
something there,

35:10.944 --> 35:12.696
and I told him I want to see
where it goes.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.614
- And how did that go over?

35:14.656 --> 35:17.826
- He was great about it,
actually.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.328
And I've been thinking...

35:20.370 --> 35:22.747
I want to keep this horse.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.916
I want Venus.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.627
- But you know there's one more
thing we have to do first,
right?

35:27.669 --> 35:30.213
- (Exhales)

35:30.255 --> 35:31.923
- You ready?

35:31.965 --> 35:33.258
- Yeah, I am.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.595
Good girl.

35:37.637 --> 35:39.139
Good girl, Venus.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.270
- You got this.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.898
- Okay.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.817
(Hooves thud slowly)

35:54.821 --> 35:56.698
Amy: That's it.

35:58.742 --> 36:00.577
(Hooves thud a bit faster)

36:00.618 --> 36:06.583
**

36:06.624 --> 36:09.210
- Amy, she's amazing!
- (Laughs)

36:10.587 --> 36:12.297
(Hooves thud faster)

36:14.466 --> 36:21.139
**

36:21.181 --> 36:24.642
- For what it's worth I know
what it's like to lose someone.

36:24.684 --> 36:26.978
It makes you feel like...

36:27.020 --> 36:28.897
well, you're helpless,

36:28.938 --> 36:31.983
like you should have been
able to prevent it.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.402
The thing is, you can't take
responsibility

36:34.444 --> 36:37.947
for the choices that
other people make.

36:37.989 --> 36:41.534
Now if Zack had his mind made
up to go down that road

36:41.576 --> 36:43.787
there's nothin' you or anybody
else coulda done

36:43.828 --> 36:44.913
to change his mind.

36:44.954 --> 36:47.207
- Yeah, I know, you're right.
It's just...

36:47.248 --> 36:50.543
I'm the one that persuaded him
to sign up in the first place.

36:50.585 --> 36:53.713
If I'd left well enough alone
he'd probably still be alive.

36:53.755 --> 36:55.882
- Okay. I didn't know Zack,

36:57.592 --> 37:00.095
but if he's half the man
you say he was

37:00.136 --> 37:03.431
he wouldn't want you
blamin' yourself.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.809
He'd want you to move on.

37:05.850 --> 37:11.815
**

37:11.856 --> 37:13.400
(Car rumbles)

37:13.441 --> 37:15.944
Georgie: Did Cass say she'd
call when she finds out
what's going on?

37:15.985 --> 37:19.447
Jim: You've got other things
to worry about.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.826
(Car turns off)

37:22.867 --> 37:25.078
(Door opens and shuts)

37:25.120 --> 37:26.830
Peter: Jim...
thanks for bringing her home.

37:26.871 --> 37:27.872
- Of course.

37:27.914 --> 37:29.666
- I wish I could say
it's nice to see you,

37:29.708 --> 37:31.084
but here we are again.
Jim: Yup.

37:31.126 --> 37:32.627
- What are we gonna do
with these two?

37:32.669 --> 37:34.295
- I don't know.

37:37.048 --> 37:38.133
- Look, I know what
you're going to say--

37:38.174 --> 37:39.259
- No, we don't want to hear it.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.928
There is no excuse for this
behavior, Georgie.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.763
You're grounded until
further notice.

37:43.805 --> 37:44.973
- And that goes for you too.

37:45.015 --> 37:46.558
- No, it's not his fault!

37:46.599 --> 37:48.018
He only did it because
I made him!

37:48.059 --> 37:49.561
Lou: Georgie, there were
a lot of other,

37:49.602 --> 37:52.230
safer choices you two
could have made.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.149
- I honestly thought
it would be okay.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.608
The clinic wasn't that far,

37:55.650 --> 37:56.943
and even dad said
I was a good driver!

37:56.985 --> 37:58.862
- Seriously? Your dad lets
you practice driving

37:58.903 --> 38:02.073
and suddenly this is his fault?
- No!

38:02.115 --> 38:05.326
You're right. Okay, I'm sorry.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.828
Peter: This isn't the first
time you've taken a vehicle

38:06.870 --> 38:09.247
without permission either,
is it?

38:09.289 --> 38:12.042
Jim: Do you know what that's
called in my line of work?

38:12.083 --> 38:13.835
- A repeat offender.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.880
- What if somebody got hurt?

38:16.921 --> 38:19.716
What if you hurt yourselves?

38:19.758 --> 38:22.844
Jim: Look, I know they had
the best of intentions,

38:22.886 --> 38:25.513
as you two always do.

38:25.555 --> 38:27.849
You could have been charged,
you know,

38:27.891 --> 38:30.018
but I'll let it go this time.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.686
Okay?

38:32.979 --> 38:34.606
Good.

38:34.647 --> 38:36.441
Now I do have to say...

38:38.193 --> 38:40.987
that's the first time I've ever
taken a pig into custody.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.697
- (Chuckles)

38:50.497 --> 38:51.414
(Rooster crows)

38:51.456 --> 39:00.173
**

39:00.215 --> 39:02.050
Peter: Katie's got a surprise
for ya.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.385
- You do?

39:04.969 --> 39:07.263
- This is you having
a big apple!

39:07.305 --> 39:09.641
- (Laughs) Honey, I love it!

39:09.683 --> 39:10.684
(Kiss)

39:10.725 --> 39:13.687
Mommy's gonna look at this
every night.

39:13.728 --> 39:15.980
- Can me and daddy
go have ice cream?

39:16.022 --> 39:17.982
Lou: (Chuckles)
That's up to daddy.

39:18.024 --> 39:21.653
- You go get your sneakers on,
okay?

39:21.695 --> 39:23.113
I'll be in in a sec to help
with the laces.

39:23.154 --> 39:25.323
Katie: Okay.

39:25.365 --> 39:27.784
- Look, I just-I want to thank
you for stepping up

39:27.826 --> 39:29.828
to make this happen for me.

39:29.869 --> 39:33.623
- Yeah, absolutely.
You, you deserve it, Lou.

39:34.916 --> 39:38.753
You know, this is my time
to, uh, stand behind you.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.630
(Chuckles)

39:40.672 --> 39:42.924
Georgie: Lou, Scott's here!

39:51.891 --> 39:53.560
- Petunia's gonna be okay?

39:53.601 --> 39:56.021
- Yeah, she's on the mend.

39:56.062 --> 39:58.231
Turns out there
wasn't any blockage.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.108
(Keys clink)

40:00.150 --> 40:01.776
- (Laughs) Where'd you find
those?

40:01.818 --> 40:03.319
- Llama enclosure.

40:03.361 --> 40:05.196
- Look, Georgie,
I know you felt responsible,

40:05.238 --> 40:09.117
but that doesn't excuse
the risk you and Adam took.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.161
- So, what is wrong
with Petunia?

40:11.202 --> 40:12.787
She is sick, right?

40:12.829 --> 40:15.290
- Well, she has pneumonia.

40:15.331 --> 40:18.293
After a round of antibiotics
she's already improving,

40:18.335 --> 40:21.671
so you probably saved her life.

40:21.713 --> 40:24.632
- And thanks for coming, Scott.
- No problem.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.092
- (Sighs)

40:26.134 --> 40:27.969
- Hey, how's Venus doing?

40:28.011 --> 40:29.637
- Really great, actually.

40:29.679 --> 40:31.139
- That's good to hear.

40:33.266 --> 40:34.559
Okay, I'm outta here.

40:34.601 --> 40:35.977
- Thanks, Scott.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.729
- See ya.
Scott: Later.

40:39.022 --> 40:42.359
- And where are you going?
- I've gotta go make a call.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.904
- And I need to talk to Mitch.
Have you seen him?

40:45.945 --> 40:47.906
- Yeah, he's out exercising
Harley.

40:47.947 --> 40:49.240
I just watched them take off.

40:49.282 --> 40:50.825
- Did you see which way he went?

40:53.119 --> 40:55.789
- No way! He said we saved
her life?

40:55.830 --> 40:57.916
- Pretty much. Makes all this
worth it, huh?

40:57.957 --> 40:59.834
- Yeah.

40:59.876 --> 41:02.045
It's just too bad we can't
celebrate together.

41:02.087 --> 41:04.589
- Yeah, I know. It sucks.
I'd like that.

41:04.631 --> 41:06.174
- Okay, then, we'll celebrate...

41:06.216 --> 41:08.259
when we're not grounded anymore.

41:08.301 --> 41:10.011
- (Laughs) If that ever happens!

41:13.139 --> 41:15.100
- Hey, Amy, how are ya?

41:15.141 --> 41:16.685
You look a little tired.

41:16.726 --> 41:18.019
- Actually, I'm, I'm great.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.648
I signed up for
a prenatal class.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.943
- I wish I could be there
with you right now.

41:24.984 --> 41:26.820
- Me too.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.571
- How was the appointment?

41:28.613 --> 41:30.156
- (Chuckles)

41:30.198 --> 41:32.742
- Is that the ultrasound?
- Yup.

41:32.784 --> 41:35.245
I've been waiting to look
at it with you.

41:35.286 --> 41:37.122
The nurse said that a trained
eye might be able to tell

41:37.163 --> 41:38.915
if it's a boy or girl.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.126
- Well, do you want to know?

41:42.335 --> 41:44.462
- I don't think I want to know.

41:44.504 --> 41:47.090
Is it okay with you
if we keep it a surprise?

41:47.132 --> 41:49.050
- To be honest,

41:49.092 --> 41:52.345
as long as our baby is healthy
I'm good either way.

41:52.387 --> 41:55.348
* It's your love,
it's your love... *

41:55.390 --> 41:56.725
Mitch: Lou!

41:58.268 --> 41:59.185
Lou: Hey!

41:59.227 --> 42:01.104
Mitch: Hey, what are you doin'
here?

42:01.146 --> 42:02.272
I thought you had a plane
to catch?

42:02.313 --> 42:04.774
- Yeah, I do, but I, uh,

42:04.816 --> 42:08.987
I wanted to see you first,
to thank you for Venus.

42:09.029 --> 42:11.281
- I'm glad she's workin' out.

42:11.322 --> 42:13.283
You know, I, uh, I wanted
to do better this time.

42:13.324 --> 42:14.909
See now the last time I bought
a horse for the dude ranch

42:14.951 --> 42:17.162
she ended up being pregnant
with twins.

42:17.203 --> 42:19.080
I'll send you the invoice.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.582
- Invoice?

42:20.623 --> 42:24.085
- Yeah, don't worry.
I got a killer deal on her.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.130
- Yeah, sure, that's... great.

42:28.423 --> 42:31.718
We needed a new trail ride
horse for the dude ranch.

42:39.267 --> 42:42.479
- Lou, about what happened
the other day at the river...

42:42.520 --> 42:45.607
Um, I feel like I owe
you an apology.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.903
My head was in a dark place.

42:49.944 --> 42:52.822
It was the anniversary
of Zack's death,

42:52.864 --> 42:54.699
and, you know,
to tell you the truth I...

42:54.741 --> 42:56.284
I still find it... hard.

43:00.955 --> 43:04.793
- Mitch, no wonder you wanted
to be alone...

43:04.834 --> 43:06.294
I'm so sorry.

43:09.923 --> 43:12.342
- Well, I think this guy's had
enough for one day.

43:12.384 --> 43:14.135
Come on, let's get you back.

43:14.177 --> 43:15.553
I wouldn't want you to miss
your flight.

43:15.595 --> 43:18.014
* It's your love,
it's your love *

43:18.056 --> 43:21.309
* It's your love
that keeps me moving on *

43:21.351 --> 43:23.978
* It's your love,
it's your love *

43:26.231 --> 43:28.775
* Ooh sweet, sweet love *

43:28.817 --> 43:35.323
**
