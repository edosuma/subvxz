00:27.068 --> 00:28.987
<i> What is it that haunts you?</i>

00:30.530 --> 00:33.533
<i>Whose eyes peer at you from the dark?</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:18.536
Welcome to Peru, Mr. Kazama.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.001
Maybe I should have been training
at a higher altitude.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.837
You'll have two days to acclimate
before the tournament.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.176
This way. We have a van ready.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.386
Wh… Where's Heihachi?

01:35.470 --> 01:39.432
Mr. Mishima is making preparations
for the tournament.

01:40.767 --> 01:45.480
Remember, do not advertise
you're related to Mr. Mishima,

01:45.563 --> 01:47.690
let alone Kazuya Mishima.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.445
Many of those competing in the tournament
tried their best to kill Kazuya.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.781
Right. Okay.

01:54.864 --> 01:59.119
I've gotta ride all the way
to the tournament with this jerk?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.288
Hwoarang.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.958
Kazama.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.835
Uh…

02:10.046 --> 02:11.464
Hello again, everyone.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.633
Please meet Jin Kazama.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.220
Hi.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.972
What's up?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.437
Mmm. Hmm.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.193
Hey, tough guys,
save it for the tournament.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.663
I should have known
I'd see you here, Kazama.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.750
Maybe you'll finally get that rematch.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.086
Wait, you two are friends?

02:51.921 --> 02:52.839
-No!
-No!

05:00.842 --> 05:03.052
You, uh, see that one before?

05:04.595 --> 05:07.265
-Huh.
-That fight is sick.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.977
It's from the second King of Iron Fist.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.354
How do you know?

05:13.438 --> 05:16.649
'Cause Heihachi is still standing.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.696
I heard the first fight
didn't go… so well for him.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.783
I heard there was video
of the end of the fight, but the…

05:26.326 --> 05:30.204
The Mishima Financial Group
had it taken down.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.205
Really?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.123
Yeah.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.709
Supposed to be brutal.

05:35.793 --> 05:39.297
Until that fight,
nobody could beat Kazuya.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.258
Well, nobody except Phoenix up there.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.721
He's the only other fighter
who came close to beating Kazuya.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.265
He almost beat Kazuya?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.976
Don't let the haircut fool you.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.938
Phoenix is one to watch out for.

05:57.565 --> 06:01.986
Did you ever hear
what happened to Kazuya

06:02.820 --> 06:05.365
after the second King of Iron Fist?

06:05.448 --> 06:09.702
Mmm, my sensei
and a lot of the other fighting masters

06:09.786 --> 06:11.454
just assumed Heihachi killed him.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.248
Or… had him killed.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.666
Killed him?

06:16.834 --> 06:18.711
If Kazuya Mishima is dead…

06:20.213 --> 06:22.090
…the world is a better place for it.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.968
Kazuya was evil in its purest form.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.389
Not that Heihachi's that much better.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.973
I bet he did kill him.

06:34.227 --> 06:40.108
May I suggest, instead of speculating
about our generous host,

06:40.191 --> 06:42.902
you instead enjoy the scenery,

06:42.985 --> 06:44.987
as we are almost to the tournament.

07:19.397 --> 07:25.069
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Iron Fist Arena.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.325
Miss Miura.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.663
I need to speak to Heihachi.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.754
Up there.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.263
So,

07:53.598 --> 07:56.142
this is where it all takes place.

07:58.936 --> 08:03.357
If Ogre indeed feeds on the energy
of the fighting spirit,

08:04.484 --> 08:09.197
he will not be able
to resist this tournament.

08:09.697 --> 08:14.410
You must survive the tournament
long enough to face Ogre,

08:15.036 --> 08:19.332
or this will all be for nothing.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.375
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.420
Don't worry, I plan on winning,

08:25.171 --> 08:29.926
and I plan on beating
that green monstrosity into the ground.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.310
There's… something I need to know.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.145
What?

08:43.105 --> 08:48.444
What happened to my father
after the last tournament?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.658
Your mind is lost in thoughts of the past

08:54.242 --> 08:57.620
when you should be focused
only on the present.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.041
Only on this tournament.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.547
Focus.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.543
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

09:46.961 --> 09:49.380
esteemed masters of the fighting arts,

09:49.463 --> 09:52.133
and, most importantly, our contenders

09:52.216 --> 09:55.761
for this,
the King of Iron Fist Tournament.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.476
Our generous host and festival sponsor,

10:03.477 --> 10:05.730
Mr. Heihachi Mishima.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.375
Welcome.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.546
Only the best are invited to compete

10:31.255 --> 10:34.675
in the King of Iron Fist competition.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.093
One of you…

10:36.177 --> 10:37.011
Hmm.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.681
…will rise
to be the best of the best.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.518
May luck be with you all.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.187
Tonight,

10:47.188 --> 10:50.316
we celebrate your hard work, skill,

10:50.399 --> 10:52.026
and dedication.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.365
Tomorrow, you fight.

11:06.666 --> 11:11.337
That is a man of few words,
even at his own party.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.255
Hmm.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.968
I'll see you later.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.846
Don't be out too late.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.640
Got a fight tomorrow.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.112
Word is,

11:36.195 --> 11:38.698
you've been personally training
with Heihachi.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.867
That you're his new golden boy.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.789
The name's Kazama. Jin Kazama.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.627
And, yeah, I trained with Mr. Mishima.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.920
So what?

11:53.003 --> 11:56.382
Everything and everyone
around that guy goes rotten.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.217
You know what I mean?

12:04.974 --> 12:08.394
I'd love to teach one
of Heihachi's goons a lesson.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.110
Hope I'll see you in the ring.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.280
Yeah, walk away,

12:20.197 --> 12:21.407
golden boy.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.671
Is there a problem, Mr. Mishima?

12:38.507 --> 12:41.719
Make sure that fighter

12:42.762 --> 12:46.599
is Jin's first match… tomorrow.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.142
<i> Hai</i>.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.283
Nina?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.660
Nina Williams?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.579
It's Jin Kazama.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.706
Can we talk?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.127
A bloke could really get himself hurt

13:15.211 --> 13:17.838
following a nice girl like me
out into the dark.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.466
What do you want, Kazama?

13:20.549 --> 13:25.971
Uh… On the way here,
what you said about Kazuya…

13:26.806 --> 13:28.098
I was wondering,

13:28.182 --> 13:32.436
were you there when he fought Heihachi?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.647
The Mishima bloodline is tainted.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.607
It's evil.

13:36.690 --> 13:40.027
The last thing I wanna do
is speak of Kazuya Mishima.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.739
I don't know what you're up to,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.866
but the last thing you wanna do

13:45.950 --> 13:48.786
is get tangled up with the Mishimas.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.002
I see you've got a way with women too.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.047
Easy, tiger.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.467
Just wanted to finish my drink
away from all those people.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.804
Hey, Phoenix.

14:07.763 --> 14:08.764
Call me Paul.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.979
What is it with you
and this Kazuya-Heihachi thing anyway?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.023
-Is that why you're here?
-No.

14:18.107 --> 14:22.403
Well, it's complicated.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.863
Complicated?

14:23.946 --> 14:27.741
Kid, "complicated" explains
about every fighter here.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.287
You know, Nina's not
the most friendly gal,

14:31.370 --> 14:32.746
but she's got a point.

14:33.497 --> 14:38.210
This isn't the best place for you
to be asking questions about the Mishimas.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.089
You fought Kazuya once, didn't you?

14:42.590 --> 14:46.051
I had a good teacher, Marshall.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.012
The guy taught me tons.

14:48.804 --> 14:53.267
Hmm. He once said,
"How we carry ourselves in the ring

14:53.350 --> 14:57.271
is a reflection
of how we carry ourselves in life." Hmm.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.107
Well, that being said,

15:01.191 --> 15:03.027
Kazuya was a mean bastard.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.779
It wasn't enough for him to just win.

15:06.405 --> 15:10.200
He had to hurt
and he had to humiliate his opponent.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.411
It's no secret to anybody.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.415
That's also how he ran
the Mishima Zaibatsu

15:16.498 --> 15:18.834
after he beat Heihachi.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.545
Did you see Heihachi and Kazuya's fight?

15:43.484 --> 15:48.030
Everything you have,
I will now take from you.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.784
Everything you thought you were,

15:53.619 --> 15:57.039
I have proven you are not.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.173
There's no reason Heihachi
should even be alive,

16:06.715 --> 16:08.592
let alone come back,

16:08.676 --> 16:11.512
fight his way through
the second King of Iron Fist,

16:12.012 --> 16:14.264
and face Kazuya again.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.829
I wouldn't be surprised at all
if Heihachi killed Kazuya.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.998
The guy's ruthless.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.542
Probably killed other men for less.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.295
But his own son?

16:47.047 --> 16:49.008
That's enough about their fights.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.261
We've got our own to worry about, right?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.931
Yeah, um, you're right.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.350
Good luck tomorrow, kid.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.688
Good luck to you too.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.025
Who needs luck?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.697
I've got the skills.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.100
Is Heihachi inside?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.813
-Mr. Mishima is not to be disturbed, Jin.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.318
Come on, Ganryu.
You know me better than that by now.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.820
You know I'm not gonna take no
for an answer.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.038
Heihachi, I need to speak to you.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.707
Later.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.209
Now.

18:06.293 --> 18:12.257
Update the roster
to include the late additions.

18:12.341 --> 18:16.512
I want answers from Bosconovitch.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.222
<i>Hai</i>.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.027
Did you kill my father?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.156
Yes.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.076
It is true.

18:40.911 --> 18:45.290
Kazuya was truly evil…

18:47.417 --> 18:51.547
his blood poisoned by the devil itself.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.300
I didn't understand at the time

18:56.426 --> 19:00.264
that something had changed inside Kazuya.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.560
Something… evil.

19:04.643 --> 19:09.523
Now, after all these years,

19:10.274 --> 19:12.568
I have the answer.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.071
The Devil Gene.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.574
The what?

19:18.657 --> 19:24.329
The Devil Gene
is a type of genetic abnormality.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.541
It gave Kazuya strength and power

19:27.624 --> 19:32.462
that was almost supernatural.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.424
The Devil Gene.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.927
Kazuya had always been rotten.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.848
He always had the potential
for great evil.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.561
But it was his pure hatred for me

19:47.644 --> 19:50.230
that awakened
the Devil Gene inside of him.

19:54.735 --> 20:00.490
This is why my mother
never told me anything about him.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.663
The Devil Gene
enhanced Kazuya's fighting ability.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.999
It gave him great power.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.169
But it also consumed him.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.757
He was completely overtaken
by the evil force.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.134
Where did it come from?

20:19.718 --> 20:23.513
The origin of the Devil Gene
remains a mystery to me.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.558
I do not possess it.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.646
But that kind of true fighting power

20:31.730 --> 20:33.941
is what speaks to Ogre.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.318
I have it.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.695
How do you know?

20:38.779 --> 20:42.783
I have been trying to unlock
the mystery of Ogre for years.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.703
We believe that he only emerges

20:46.787 --> 20:50.082
when he can sense
the most powerful of fighters.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.211
He must have sensed that… in you.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.213
Me?

20:57.506 --> 21:00.425
What happened
before Ogre arrived that night?

21:00.968 --> 21:03.053
Had you been fighting?

21:03.637 --> 21:06.807
Yes, against some bullies.

21:06.890 --> 21:11.687
Then it's quite possible
he sought to confront your power

21:11.770 --> 21:13.021
to absorb it.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.275
My mother died because of me.

21:17.651 --> 21:21.363
You will honor her sacrifice

21:21.446 --> 21:26.702
by drawing out and confronting Ogre.

21:40.507 --> 21:44.553
<i>What else has Bosconovitch learned</i>
<i>about the pendant?</i>

21:47.556 --> 21:50.017
<i>I had him send his latest findings.</i>

21:50.100 --> 21:52.811
<i>The report is on your desk.</i>

21:53.812 --> 21:57.441
<i> Hmm. What about the cell?</i>

21:58.900 --> 22:04.990
<i> The doctor has assured me</i>
<i>that the holding cell will contain Ogre.</i>

22:07.617 --> 22:13.999
I will soon learn everything
there is to know about its power.

22:14.082 --> 22:18.503
Do you believe
Jin is strong enough to defeat it?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.673
It doesn't matter if he can beat him.

22:22.841 --> 22:28.263
<i>I only need Kazama</i>
<i>to lure Ogre into the open.</i>
