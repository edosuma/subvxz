WEBVTT

00:11.512 --> 00:14.607
I wonder what's wrong with her.
She's sort of queasy.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.312
- Indigestion. Like she didn't want to land.
- If you think there's gonna be trouble,

00:19.436 --> 00:22.531
we could always get back inside
and go somewhere else.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.952
I think we've landed inside a cupboard.
Here we go.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.917
Open door 75.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.665
Some sort of base.

00:35.786 --> 00:39.131
Moon base, sea base, space base.
They build these things out of kits.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.130
Glad we're indoors.
Sounds like a storm out there.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.594
Open door 76.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.473
Human design,
you've got a thing about kits.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.724
This place was put together like a flat-pack
wardrobe, only bigger and easier.

00:51.802 --> 00:55.272
- Open door 77.
- Oh, it's a sanctuary base!

00:55.347 --> 00:57.395
- Close door 77.
- Deep-space exploration.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.693
We've gone way out. And listen to that.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.484
Underneath. Someone's drilling.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.491
"Welcome to hell."

01:06.608 --> 01:10.579
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- No, over there.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.997
Hold on.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.999
What does that say?

01:23.292 --> 01:25.511
That's weird. It won't translate.

01:25.836 --> 01:30.091
But I thought the Tardis
translated everything, writing as well.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.346
- I should see English.
- Exactly.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.605
Now if that's not working, then it means...

01:36.680 --> 01:38.899
this writing is old.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.393
Very old.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.025
Impossibly old.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.947
We should find out who's in charge.

01:46.023 --> 01:49.243
We've gone beyond the reach of
the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.737
- And if someone's looking for...
- Open door 79.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.660
Right, hello. Sorry.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.538
I was just saying, nice place.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.370
We must feed.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.581
- You gotta what?
- We must feed.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.507
- Yeah, I think they mean us.
- We must feed.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.551
We must feed.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.544
We must feed.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.551
We must feed.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.390
We must feed.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.101
We must feed. We must feed.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.355
We must feed. We must feed.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.274
We must feed. We must feed.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.774
We must feed...

03:07.437 --> 03:09.735
you, if you are hungry.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.319
- Sorry?
- We apologise.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.035
Electromagnetics have interfered
with speech systems.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.620
Would you like some refreshment?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.794
- Open door 78.
- Um...

03:24.037 --> 03:25.789
What the hell?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.462
How did...

03:34.214 --> 03:38.060
Captain, you're not gonna believe this.
We've got people.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.389
Out of nowhere.
I mean, real people. I mean...

03:41.471 --> 03:46.227
Two living people just standing here
right in front of me.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.108
Don't be stupid, that's impossible.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.817
- I suggest telling them that.
- But you're a sort of space base.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.501
You must have visitors now and then.
It can't be that impossible.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.370
You telling me
you don't know where you are?

03:57.487 --> 03:59.910
No idea. More fun that way.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.666
Stand by, everyone. Buckle down.
We have incoming, and it's a big one.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.208
Quake 0.5 on its way.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.335
Through here. Now.
Quickly, come on! Move!

04:15.005 --> 04:17.099
Move it! Come on!

04:19.176 --> 04:22.055
Keep moving! Come on! Keep moving!

04:35.525 --> 04:37.869
Oh, my God, you meant it.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.578
- People! Look at that, real people.
- That's us. Hurray!

04:41.656 --> 04:45.377
Yeah, definitely real.
My name's Rose, Rose Tyler,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.250
and this is the Doctor.

04:47.329 --> 04:52.631
Come on, the oxygen must be offline.
We're hallucinating, they can't be...

04:52.709 --> 04:56.259
- No, they're real.
- Come on, we're in the middle of an alert.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.888
Danny, strap up, the quake's coming in.
Impact in 30 seconds.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.971
Sorry, you two, whoever you are,
just hold on. Tight.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.807
- Hold on to what?
- Anything, I don't care, just hold on.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.563
Ood, are we fixed?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.896
Your kindness in this emergency
is much appreciated.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.107
- What's this planet called anyway?
- Don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.409
How could it have a name?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.452
You really don't know, do you?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
And impact!

05:27.494 --> 05:29.417
Oh, well. That wasn't so bad...

05:42.008 --> 05:45.057
Okay, that's it. Everyone all right?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.936
Speak to me! Ida?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.103
- Yeah.
- Danny?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.479
- I'm fine.
- Toby?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.692
- Fine.
- Scooti?

05:51.768 --> 05:52.860
- No damage.
Jefferson?

05:52.936 --> 05:53.983
Check!

05:54.062 --> 05:55.939
We're fine, thanks, fine.
Yeah, don't worry about us.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.444
Surface caved in.
I deflected it onto Storage 5 through 8.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.995
We've lost them completely.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.831
Toby, go and check the rocket link.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.708
That's not my department.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.751
Just do as I say, yeah?

06:13.707 --> 06:17.962
Oxygen holding.
Internal gravity at 56.6.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.134
We should be okay.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.636
Never mind the earthquake, that's...

06:23.550 --> 06:26.645
That's one hell of a storm.
What is that, a hurricane?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.815
You need an atmosphere for a hurricane.
There's no air out there.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.267
It's a complete vacuum.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.976
Then what's shaking the roof?

06:33.059 --> 06:36.905
You're not joking. You really don't know.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.446
Well, introductions.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.495
FYI, as they said in the olden days.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.202
I'm Ida Scott, Science Officer.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.911
Zachary Cross Flane, Acting Captain, sir.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.045
You've met Mr Jefferson,
he's Head of Security.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.708
Danny Bartock, Ethics Committee.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.675
Not as boring as it sounds.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.595
And that man who just left,
that was Toby Zed,

07:00.670 --> 07:03.423
Archaeology, and this...

07:03.506 --> 07:06.350
is Scooti Manista, Trainee Maintenance.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.470
And this...

07:10.263 --> 07:11.640
This is home.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.730
Brace yourselves.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.312
The sight of it sends some people mad.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.295
That's a black hole.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.427
But that's impossible.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.928
I did warn you.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.884
We're standing under a black hole.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.145
- In orbit.
- We can't be.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.064
You can see for yourself.
We're in orbit.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.310
But we can't be.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.398
This lump of rock is suspended
in perpetual geostationary orbit

08:00.480 --> 08:03.780
around that black hole, without falling in.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.159
Discuss.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.909
And that's bad, yeah?

08:08.989 --> 08:12.539
Bad doesn't cover it.
A black hole's a dead star.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.417
It collapses in on itself, in and in and
in, until the matter's so dense and tight,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.669
it starts to pull everything else in, too.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.092
Nothing in the universe can escape it.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.886
Light, gravity, time,

08:23.962 --> 08:27.762
everything just gets
pulled inside and crushed.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.682
So they can't be in orbit?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.308
- We should be pulled right in.
- We should be dead.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.140
And yet, here we are.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.981
Beyond the laws of physics.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.984
Welcome on board.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.862
But if there's no atmosphere out there,
what's that?

08:44.941 --> 08:48.286
Stars breaking up. Gas clouds.

08:48.695 --> 08:53.576
We have whole solar systems
being ripped apart above our heads,

08:54.117 --> 08:55.915
before falling into that thing.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.962
So, a bit worse than a storm, then.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.249
- Just a bit.
- Just a bit, yeah.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.768
Toby.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.027
Who's that?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.996
Danny?

09:41.414 --> 09:44.293
- Close door 7.
- The rocket link's fine.

09:47.837 --> 09:52.638
That's the black hole,
officially designated K37 Gem 5.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.561
In the scriptures of the Veltino,

09:55.637 --> 09:59.983
this planet is called Krop
Tor, the bitter pill.

10:00.058 --> 10:04.154
And the black hole
is supposed to be a mighty demon

10:04.229 --> 10:07.199
who was tricked into devouring the planet

10:07.357 --> 10:10.907
only to spit it out because it was poison.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.745
- The bitter pill. I like that.
- We are so far out.

10:15.824 --> 10:19.294
Lost in the drifts of the universe.
How did you even get here?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.542
We flew in. You see...

10:22.747 --> 10:25.626
this planet's generating a gravity field.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.052
We don't know how, we've no idea,

10:28.128 --> 10:32.133
but it's kept in constant balance
against the black hole.

10:32.215 --> 10:36.470
And the field extends
out there as a funnel,

10:36.553 --> 10:41.650
a distinct gravity funnel
reaching out into clear space.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.192
That was our way in.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.568
You flew down that thing?
Like a rollercoaster.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.490
By rights,
the ship should've been torn apart.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.661
We lost the captain,
which is what put me in charge.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.487
And you're doing a good job.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.573
Yeah, well. Needs must.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.540
But if that gravity funnel closes,
there's no way out.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.620
Oh, we have fun speculating about that.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.373
Oh, yeah. That's the word, "fun".

11:05.456 --> 11:09.086
But that field would take
phenomenal amounts of power, I mean...

11:09.794 --> 11:13.173
Not just big, but off the scale. Can 1...?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.260
Sure, help yourself.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.434
Your refreshment.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.481
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.772
I'm sorry, what was your name?

11:24.893 --> 11:28.318
We have no titles. We are as one.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.025
Erm, what are they called?

11:32.650 --> 11:36.120
Oh, come on. Where have you been living?
Everyone's got one.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.410
Well, not me. So, what are they?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.285
- They're the Ood.
- The Ood?

11:41.367 --> 11:43.210
The Ood.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.163
Well, that's Ood.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.586
Very Ood. But handy.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.339
They work the mineshaft,
all the drilling and stuff.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.170
Supervision and maintenance.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.348
They're born for it. Basic slave race.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.100
You've got slaves?

11:57.175 --> 11:59.803
Don't start. She's like one of that lot,
Friends of the Ood.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.977
Well, maybe I am, yeah.
Since when do humans need slaves?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.270
But the Ood offer themselves.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.770
If you don't give them orders,
they just pine away and die.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.365
Seriously? You like being ordered about?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.867
It is all we crave.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.288
- Why is that, then?
- We have nothing else in life.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.207
Yeah, well, I used to think like that.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.827
- Long time ago.
- There we go. Do you see?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.833
To generate that gravity field
and the funnel,

12:25.912 --> 12:28.415
you'd need a power source
with an inverted self-extrapolating reﬂex

12:28.498 --> 12:30.671
of six to the power of
six every six seconds.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.673
- That's all the sixes.
- And it's impossible.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.754
It took us two years to work that out.

12:34.837 --> 12:38.637
- I'm very good.
- But that's why we're here.

12:39.175 --> 12:43.055
This power source is ten miles below,
through solid rock.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.853
Point 0.
We're drilling down to try and find it.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.186
It's giving off readings
of over 90 Statts on the Blazen Scale.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.192
It could revolutionise modern science.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.656
We could use it to fuel the empire.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.108
Or start a war.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.037
It's buried beneath us.
In the darkness, waiting.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.706
What's your job? Chief dramatist?

13:02.490 --> 13:06.040
Well, whatever it is down there,
it's not a natural phenomenon.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.497
This planet once supported life,

13:08.579 --> 13:11.298
aeons ago, before the human race
had even learnt to walk.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.752
I saw that lettering written on the wall,
did you do that?

13:13.876 --> 13:16.316
I copied it from fragments
we found unearthed by the drilling,

13:16.379 --> 13:18.302
but I can't translate it.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.055
No, neither can I.
And that's saying something.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.304
And there was some form of civilisation.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.431
They buried something.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.684
Now, it's reaching out.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.768
Calling us in.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.650
And you came.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.982
How could we not?

13:35.064 --> 13:38.489
So, when it comes right down to it,
why did you come here?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.572
Why did you do that? Why?
I'll tell you why.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.908
Because it was there. Brilliant!

13:45.408 --> 13:48.207
- Excuse me. Zack, wasn't it?
- That's me.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.169
Just stand there 'cause I'm gonna hug you,
is that all right?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.716
Suppose so.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.710
Here we go. Coming in.

13:58.463 --> 14:02.093
Human beings. You are amazing.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.431
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.103
But apart from that,
you're completely mad.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.686
You should pack your bags, get back
on that ship and fly for your lives.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.397
You can talk. How the
hell did you get here?

14:15.480 --> 14:20.907
Oh, I've got this... This ship... It's
hard to explain, it just sort of appears.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.239
We can show you,
we parked down the corridor from...

14:24.322 --> 14:27.371
- What's it called? Habitation Area 3?
- 3.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.499
Do you mean Storage 6?

14:30.578 --> 14:33.047
It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.545
Storage 6? But you said...

14:35.625 --> 14:37.423
You said...

14:37.960 --> 14:40.054
You said Storage 5 to 8.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.886
What is it? What's wrong?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.811
Open door 79.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.978
Close door 79.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.983
- Doors, come on!
- Open door 77.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.315
Open door 75.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.702
- Open door 76.
- It can't be, it can't be!

15:03.820 --> 15:06.243
What's wrong? What is it?

15:06.364 --> 15:09.163
Doctor, the Tardis is in there.
What's happened?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.128
The Tardis is gone.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.831
Door 76 out of commission.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.004
The earthquake. This section collapsed.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.553
But it's got to be out there somewhere.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.516
Look down.

15:35.309 --> 15:39.155
The ground gave way. My Tardis must have
fallen down into the heart of the planet.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.278
You've got robot drills
heading the same way.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.530
We can't divert the drilling.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.708
But I need my ship! It's all I've got.
Literally, the only thing.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.956
Doctor, we've only got the resources
to dig one central shaft

15:53.035 --> 15:55.288
down to the power source and that's it.

15:55.371 --> 15:59.126
No diversions, no distractions,
no exceptions.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.879
Your machine is lost.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.928
All I can do is offer you a lift,
if we ever get to leave this place.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.556
And that is the end of it.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.769
I'll put you on the duty roster.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.476
We need someone in the laundry.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.563
Open door 7.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.451
Close door 7.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.335
- I've trapped you here.
- No, don't worry about me.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.917
Okay, we're on a planet
that shouldn't exist,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.594
underneath a black hole

16:43.711 --> 16:45.304
and no way out.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.552
Yeah, I've changed my mind.
Start worrying about me.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.857
Entering night shift.

17:03.940 --> 17:08.491
Your chosen track for transition
is Ravel's Bolero.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.233
All finished. Heading back inside.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.827
Server Gamma 10.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.489
Server Gamma 11.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.284
Server Gamma 12.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.092
Toby.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.108
- I can see you.
- Danny, is that you?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.779
It's not funny, all right?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.569
Dan?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.453
I'm trying to work, Daniel.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.498
If that's you, Dan,
can you just stop it?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.391
Danny,
check the temperature in Ood Habitation.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.438
It seems to be rising.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.028
Help yourself, just don't have the green.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.855
Or the blue.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.991
Um, a bit of that, thanks.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.283
Would you like sauce with that?

19:18.366 --> 19:20.209
I'll have a go, yeah.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.259
I did that job once. I was a dinner lady.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.470
Not that I'm calling you a lady.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.094
Although, I don't know, you might be.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.428
Do you actually get paid, though?
Do they give you money?

19:38.511 --> 19:43.142
The Beast and his armies shall rise
from the Pit to make war against God.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.527
I'm sorry?

19:47.895 --> 19:51.650
Apologies.
I said I hope you enjoy your meal.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.864
Yeah.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.209
Drill head now at point 76.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.248
Drill head speed increasing.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.173
Keep pressure at 60.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.233
Close door 3.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.402
Close door 3.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.275
He is awake.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.282
What did you say?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.904
Close door 3.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.297
Toby.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.628
Don't turn around.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.260
Dan?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.137
- That's not Dan.
- Don't look at me.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.689
Who are you?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.518
I have so many names.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.645
If I could...

21:10.728 --> 21:13.197
If you look at me, you will die.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.570
But who are you?

21:15.649 --> 21:18.072
I'm behind you, Toby.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.655
I'm right behind you.

21:20.738 --> 21:24.083
Don't look. Don't look at me.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.796
One look and you will die.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.545
I'm reaching out, Toby.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.211
I'm so close.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.680
Don't turn around.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.302
Oh, I can touch you.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.929
No.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.409
Zack, we got a problem?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.612
No more than usual.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.448
Got the Scarlet System burning up.
Might be worth a look.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.660
You might want to see this.
Moment in history.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.555
There, on the edge.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.638
That red cloud.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.473
That used to be the Scarlet System.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.145
Home to the Pallushi.

23:13.017 --> 23:17.113
A mighty civilisation
spanning a billion years

23:17.187 --> 23:19.986
disappearing forever.

23:21.692 --> 23:24.320
Their planets and suns consumed.

23:26.739 --> 23:31.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have witnessed its passing.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.705
No, could you leave it open?

23:35.414 --> 23:38.418
Just for a bit. I won't go mad, I promise.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.502
How would you know?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.756
Scooti, check the lockdown.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.809
Jefferson, sign off the
airlock seals for me.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.511
Open door 78.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.889
I've seen films and things, yeah?

23:51.013 --> 23:54.233
They say black holes are like
gateways to another universe.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.602
Close door 78.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.779
Not that one. It just eats.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.324
A long way from home.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.654
Go that way,

24:06.737 --> 24:10.082
turn right, keep going for, erm...

24:10.157 --> 24:14.537
about 500 years and you'll reach the Earth.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.460
No signal.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.636
That's first time we've gone out of range.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.009
Mind you, even if I could...

24:26.548 --> 24:28.596
What would I tell her?

24:31.512 --> 24:33.890
Can you build another Tardis?

24:35.516 --> 24:37.860
They were grown, not built.

24:37.935 --> 24:41.235
And with my home planet gone,

24:41.313 --> 24:42.906
we're kind of stuck.

24:44.066 --> 24:47.491
Well, it could be worse.
This lot said they'd give us a lift.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.287
And then what?

24:50.239 --> 24:52.583
I don't know.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.002
Find a planet. Get a job.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.206
You live your life
same as the rest of the universe.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.507
I'd have to settle down.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.925
Get a house or something.
A proper house with...

25:05.045 --> 25:08.424
doors and things. Carpets.
Me, living in a house!

25:08.549 --> 25:11.678
Now, that... That... That is terrifying.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.728
You'd have to get a mortgage.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.181
- Oh, yes.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.642
I'm dying. That's it, I am dying.
It is all over.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.978
What about me? I'd have to get one, too.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.606
I don't know, could be the same one.
We could both...

25:25.441 --> 25:27.694
I don't know, share.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.996
Or not. Whatever.
I don't know. All sorts of...

25:31.113 --> 25:33.161
- Anyway...
- We'll see.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.297
I promised Jackie
I would always take you back home.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.252
Everyone leaves home in the end.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.884
Not to end up stuck here.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.716
Yeah, but stuck with
you, that's not so bad.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.136
- Yeah?
- Yes.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.779
He is awake.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.489
- Evening.
- Only us.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.743
The mysterious couple.
How are you, then? Settling in?

26:16.825 --> 26:21.251
Yeah, sorry, straight to business.
The Ood, how do they communicate?

26:21.330 --> 26:22.673
I mean, with each other?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.967
Oh, just em paths.

26:25.042 --> 26:28.171
There's a low-level telepathic field
connecting them.

26:28.295 --> 26:32.801
Not that that does them much good.
They're basically a herd race, like cattle.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.557
This telepathic field,
can it pick up messages?

26:35.677 --> 26:39.648
'Cause I was having dinner
and one of the Oods said something...

26:39.723 --> 26:41.441
Well, odd.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.269
Hmm. An odd Ood.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.481
And then I got something else on my...

26:46.563 --> 26:47.985
communicator thing.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.942
Well, be fair.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.370
We've got whole star systems
burning up around us,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.369
there's all sorts of stray transmissions.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.542
Probably nothing.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.212
Look, if there was something wrong,
it would show.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.878
We monitor the telepathic field.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.966
It's the only way to look after them.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.922
They're so stupid.
They don't even tell us when they're ill.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.133
- Monitor the field, that's this thing.
- Yeah.

27:14.216 --> 27:18.722
But like I said, it's low-level telepathy.
They only register Basic 5.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.436
Well, that's not Basic 5. 10.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.185
20.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.321
- They've gone up to Basic 30.
- But they can't.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.115
Doctor, the Ood.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.912
What does Basic 30 mean?

27:34.987 --> 27:39.538
Well, it means that they're shouting,
screaming inside their heads.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.710
Or something is shouting at them.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.585
But where is it coming from?
What is it saying?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.541
What did it say to you?

27:47.624 --> 27:50.002
Something about the Beast and the Pit.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.048
What about your communicator?
What did that say?

27:55.465 --> 27:56.887
He is awake.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.516
And you will worship him.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.724
- What the hell?
- He is awake.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.104
And you will worship him.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.610
Worship who?

28:08.187 --> 28:11.487
Who's talking to you? Who is it?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.655
Toby, I've got your expenditure.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.779
Open door 47.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.870
Close door 47.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.462
41?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.461
Close door 40.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.086
Computer, did you open and close door 41?

28:32.169 --> 28:33.386
Confirmed.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.511
But that's the airlock.
Why would you open the airlock?

28:36.590 --> 28:39.013
It's the night shift,
we're not allowed outside.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.891
- Has someone gone out?
- Confirmed.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.519
- But who was it?
- Cannot confirm.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.109
Okay. Right, hold on, I know.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.480
Tell me whose spacesuit
has been logged out.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.566
- No space-suit has been logged out.
- But...

28:54.149 --> 28:57.995
You're not making any sense.
You can't go outside without...

28:58.070 --> 29:00.198
Zack, I think we've got a breakdown
on door 41.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.908
It's saying somebody's gone outside
onto the planet's surface.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.415
Zack?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.211
Zack?

29:08.997 --> 29:11.841
- Computer, trace fault.
- There is no fault.

29:11.959 --> 29:15.759
- Tell me who went through that door?
- He is awake.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.849
- What?
- He is awake.

29:20.467 --> 29:24.017
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He bathes in the black sun.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.621
Toby.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.920
There's no air, there's no...

30:16.231 --> 30:18.950
No, stop it! You can't be!

30:25.657 --> 30:29.002
Open door 40! Open door 40!

30:29.578 --> 30:33.048
Open door 40! Open door 40!

30:33.749 --> 30:35.126
Open door 40!

30:41.715 --> 30:45.515
Emergency hull breach.
Emergency hull breach.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.096
Which section?

30:47.220 --> 30:51.350
Everyone, evacuate 11 to 13.
We've got a breach.

30:51.433 --> 30:55.108
The Base is open. Repeat, the Base is open.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.118
Open door 79.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.452
Close door 79.

31:06.531 --> 31:10.081
I can't contain the oxygen field.
We're gonna lose it.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.790
Come on! Keep moving!

31:15.791 --> 31:18.544
And you, too, sunshine!

31:20.295 --> 31:22.138
<i>- Everyone</i> all right?
<i>- Breach sealed.</i>

31:22.255 --> 31:25.429
- What happened? What was it?
- Hull breach.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.762
We were open to the elements.
Another couple of minutes

31:27.886 --> 31:30.435
and we'd have been inspecting
that black hole at close quarters.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.232
That wasn't a quake. What caused it?

31:32.307 --> 31:36.653
We've lost sections 11 to 13.
Everyone all right?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.447
We've got everyone here except Scooti.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.400
Scooti, report.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.621
Scooti Manista, this is an order, report.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.906
She 3 all right.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.663
I've picked up her biochip.
She's in Habitation 3.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.752
Better go and check
if she's not responding.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.626
She might be unconscious.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.716
But how about that, eh? We survived.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.759
Habitation 3. Come on.

31:59.835 --> 32:03.135
I don't often say this,
but I think we could all do with a drink.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.806
Come on.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.851
What happened?

32:07.968 --> 32:11.097
I don't know.
I was working and then I can't remember.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.274
All that noise. The room was falling apart.
There was no air.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.944
Come on, up you get.
Come and have some Protein One.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.568
- You've gone native.
- Oi, don't knock it, it's nice.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.400
Protein One with just a dash of Three.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.492
There's no sign of her,
but the biochip says she's in this area.

32:27.571 --> 32:31.121
Scooti, please respond.
If you can hear this, please respond.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.419
- Habitation 6...
- Nowhere here.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.293
Zack, we've got a problem.
Scooti's still missing.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.045
<i>But it says Habitation 3.</i>

32:39.124 --> 32:41.752
Well, that's where I am
and I'm telling you, she's not here.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.712
I've found her.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.715
Oh, my God.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.230
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.147
Captain...

33:03.815 --> 33:07.570
report Officer Scootori Manista, PKD...

33:09.738 --> 33:11.365
deceased.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.250
43K 2.1.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.168
She was 20.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.550
20 years old.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.440
For how should man die better

33:42.270 --> 33:44.364
Than facing fearful odds

33:45.607 --> 33:47.780
For the ashes of his father

33:49.945 --> 33:53.950
And the temples of his gods?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.590
It's stopped.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.968
What was that?

34:06.086 --> 34:08.464
- What was it?
- The drill.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.801
We've stopped drilling. We've made it.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.143
Point 0.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.978
<i>All non-essential Oods
to be confined.</i>

34:19.808 --> 34:23.608
Capsule established.
All systems functioning.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.737
The mineshaft is go.
Bring systems online now.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.239
Reporting as a volunteer
for the expeditionary force.

34:30.318 --> 34:34.243
Doctor, this is breaking
every single protocol.

34:34.322 --> 34:39.203
- We don't even know who you are.
- Yeah, but you trust me, don't you?

34:39.327 --> 34:41.955
And you can't let Ida
go down there on her own.

34:42.038 --> 34:46.635
Go on, look me in the eye.
Yes, you do. I can see it. Trust.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.342
I should be going down.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.885
The captain doesn't lead the mission.
He stays here, in charge.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.137
Not much good here, am I?

34:59.598 --> 35:00.850
Positions!

35:00.932 --> 35:04.653
We're going down in two!
Everyone, positions!

35:04.728 --> 35:07.607
Mr Jefferson, I want maximum systems...

35:07.689 --> 35:11.535
Oxygen, nitro balance, gravity.
It's ages since I wore one of these.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.454
I want that spacesuit back in one piece.
You got that?

35:14.529 --> 35:16.031
Yes, sir.

35:17.240 --> 35:22.462
It's funny 'cause people back home
think that space travel is gonna be all...

35:22.537 --> 35:27.589
whizzing about and teleports, anti-gravity.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.880
But it's not, is it? It's tough.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.389
I'll see you later.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.892
Not if I see you first.

35:44.100 --> 35:48.856
You will remain here.
No command can override this.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.612
Have you got that?

35:52.734 --> 35:54.828
My instructions only.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.909
Capsule active.

36:02.243 --> 36:06.214
Counting down, in ten, nine,

36:06.289 --> 36:11.261
eight, seven, six, five,

36:11.628 --> 36:15.303
four, three, two,

36:15.757 --> 36:18.135
one, release.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.898
You've gone beyond the oxygen field.
You're on your own.

37:14.149 --> 37:17.153
Don't forget to breathe. Breathing is good.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.997
- Rose, stay off the comm.
- No chance.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.658
Doctor? Doctor, are you all right?

37:56.733 --> 37:59.282
Ida, report to me.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.862
Doctor?

38:01.488 --> 38:05.538
It's all right. We've made it.
Heading out of the capsule now.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.049
What's it like down there?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.717
It's hard to tell.

38:15.877 --> 38:20.348
Some sort of cave. Cavern. It's massive.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.597
Well, this should help. Gravity globe.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.071
That's...

38:35.730 --> 38:37.073
That's...

38:38.066 --> 38:40.945
Oh, my God. That's beautiful.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.198
Rose...

38:44.280 --> 38:46.499
you can tell Toby...

38:48.034 --> 38:50.378
we've found his civilisation.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.793
Oi, Toby, sounds like
you've got plenty of work.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.590
Good, good.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.470
Good.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.511
Concentrate now, people.
Keep on the mission.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.928
Ida, what about the power source?

39:06.427 --> 39:08.179
We're close.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.858
Energy signature indicates north-northwest.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.981
Are you getting pictures up there?

39:14.102 --> 39:17.322
There's too much interference.
We 're in your hands.

39:17.438 --> 39:21.409
Well, we've come this far.
There's no turning back.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.532
Oh, did you have to?

39:23.611 --> 39:27.957
No turning back? That's almost as bad as,
"Nothing can possibly go wrong"

39:28.032 --> 39:30.706
or "This is gonna be the best Christmas
Walford's ever had."

39:30.785 --> 39:32.913
Have you finished?

39:34.914 --> 39:36.757
Yeah. Finished.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.724
Captain, sir, there's something happening
with the Ood.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.143
What are they doing?

39:51.472 --> 39:52.974
They're staring at me.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.651
I've told them to stop, but they won't.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.114
Danny, you're a big boy,
I think you can take being stared at.

40:00.648 --> 40:04.824
But the telepathic field, sir,
it's at Basic 100.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.786
I've checked. There isn't any fault.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.914
- It's definitely 100.
- But that's impossible.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.587
- What's Basic 100 mean?
- They should be dead.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.756
Basic 100 is brain death.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.425
But they're safe?
They're not actually moving?

40:19.500 --> 40:20.592
No, sir.

40:20.668 --> 40:26.016
Keep watching them. And you, Jefferson,
keep a guard on the Ood.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.763
Officer at arms.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.186
You can't fire a gun in here.
What if you hit a wall?

40:30.261 --> 40:33.936
Firing Stock 15,
only impacts upon organics.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.109
- Keep watch. Guard them.
- Yes, sir.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.937
- Is everything all right up there?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.693
- It's fine.
- Great.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.616
We've found something.

40:47.695 --> 40:51.245
It looks like metal,
like some sort of seal.

40:51.324 --> 40:54.749
I've got a nasty feeling
the word might be "trap door".

40:54.869 --> 40:57.748
Not a good word, trap door.
Never met a trap door I liked.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.083
The edge is covered
with those symbols.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.633
<i>- Do</i> you <i>think</i> it opens?
- That's what trap doors tend to do.

41:03.711 --> 41:07.386
Trap door doesn't do it justice.
It's massive, Zack.

41:08.925 --> 41:12.680
- About 30 feet in diameter.
- Any way of opening it?

41:12.804 --> 41:16.399
Don't know.
I can't see any sort of mechanism.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.694
I suppose that's the writing.
It would tell us what to do.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.568
The letters that defy translation.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.862
Toby, did you get anywhere
with decoding it?

41:24.983 --> 41:28.362
Toby, they need to know. That lettering,
does it make any sort of sense?

41:28.444 --> 41:30.037
I know what it says.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.615
Then tell them.

41:31.739 --> 41:35.460
- When did you work that out?
- It doesn't matter, just tell them!

41:35.576 --> 41:38.955
These are the words of the Beast.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.583
And he has woken.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.215
He is the heart that beats in the darkness.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.637
He is the blood that will never cease.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.932
And now he will rise.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.303
Officer, you will stand down. Stand down!

41:52.385 --> 41:56.310
What is it? What's he done?
What's happening? Rose, what's going on?

41:56.431 --> 41:58.433
Jefferson, report.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.192
Report!

42:00.268 --> 42:02.066
Officer, you have compromised security.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.274
You will stand down
and be confined. Immediately!

42:05.356 --> 42:10.328
Mr Jefferson, tell me, sir...
did your wife ever forgive you?

42:12.572 --> 42:14.074
I don't know what you mean.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.125
Let me tell you a secret.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.874
She never did.

42:20.621 --> 42:24.296
Officer, you will stand down
and be confined.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.465
Or what?

42:26.544 --> 42:30.139
Or under the strictures of Condition Red,
I am authorised to shoot you.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.509
But how many can you kill?

42:52.695 --> 42:55.824
We are the legion of the Beast.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.711
Rose, what is it? Rose?

43:00.703 --> 43:04.207
- I'm going back up.
- Report! Report!

43:04.832 --> 43:06.630
Jefferson, report!

43:07.001 --> 43:08.924
Someone report!

43:11.172 --> 43:16.349
The legion shall be many
and the legion shall be few.

43:16.511 --> 43:17.808
It's the Ood.

43:17.887 --> 43:20.561
Sir, we have contamination
of the livestock.

43:20.681 --> 43:23.309
Doctor, I don't know what it is.
It's like they're possessed.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.486
They won't listen to us.

43:25.603 --> 43:29.779
He has woven himself
in the fabric of your life

43:29.857 --> 43:32.155
since the dawn of time.

43:32.819 --> 43:35.072
Some may call him Abbadon.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.124
Some may call him Krop Tor.

43:38.741 --> 43:41.995
Some may call him Satan or Lucifer.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.297
Captain, it's the Ood.
They're out of control.

43:44.372 --> 43:49.299
The King of Despair,
the Deathless Prince.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.630
The Bringer of Night.

43:54.423 --> 43:58.894
And these are the words
that shall set him free.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.514
Back up to the door!

44:01.597 --> 44:04.646
- I am become manifest.
- Move quickly!

44:04.725 --> 44:07.148
- I shall walk in the light.
- To the door!

44:07.228 --> 44:11.574
And my legions will swarm across worlds.

44:22.076 --> 44:24.750
Doctor, it's opening!

44:28.040 --> 44:29.633
We're moving!

44:29.709 --> 44:34.055
The whole thing's moving,
the planet's moving.

44:54.567 --> 44:59.289
I am the sin and the temptation
and the desire.

44:59.488 --> 45:02.867
I am the pain and the loss
and the death of hope.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.827
Get that door open!

45:13.211 --> 45:15.885
The gravity field, it's going!

45:16.631 --> 45:18.474
We're losing orbit!

45:20.635 --> 45:22.888
We're gonna fall into the black hole!

45:27.516 --> 45:31.146
I have been imprisoned for eternity.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.606
But no more.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.196
Door sealed. Door sealed.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.780
The Pit is open

45:41.822 --> 45:45.417
and I am free!

46:43.718 --> 46:46.221
It's the Ood. They've gone mad.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.068
Doctor, can you hear me?
Doctor, Ida, are you there?

46:53.144 --> 46:54.361
Danny, turn right.

46:54.437 --> 46:57.065
That thing is playing on very basic fears.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.533
- The cable's snapped.
- Get out!

47:06.032 --> 47:09.957
You will die and I will live.
