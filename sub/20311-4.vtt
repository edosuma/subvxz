WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.671
Gerry: There's five seconds
left, Celtics to win it all

00:03.671 --> 00:07.424
Gerry: He drives in.
Damn!

00:12.805 --> 00:15.516
Gerry: He's driving into the
hoop to win it all!! Yeah!!

00:15.516 --> 00:20.228
Lisa: Gerry! Are you kidding me?
Exams!

00:20.228 --> 00:22.397
Gerry: I didn't think
you started yet.

00:22.397 --> 00:27.152
Did you see that shot? I slam
dunked it! I've never done that.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.613
Lisa: You lowered the basket,
it's not even regulation.

00:29.613 --> 00:33.784
Gerry: Doesn't matter...
but I still... slammed it!

00:36.996 --> 00:40.457
Gerry: That's was a 3
grade 11's!...Celtic's win!

00:40.457 --> 00:43.084
♪ I'm awesome,
no you're not dude, don't lie

00:43.084 --> 00:45.629
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving
around in my mom's ride

00:45.629 --> 00:48.924
♪ I'm awesome, a quarter
of my life gone by

00:50.968 --> 00:52.928
♪ I'm awesome, awesome,
awesome.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.140
Lisa: Hey Gerry, busy week huh?
Gerry: Mmmm

00:57.140 --> 00:59.935
Lisa: Ready for your
first exam tomorrow?

00:59.935 --> 01:03.397
Gerry: Uh yup, I'm almost
there just gotta finish it

01:03.397 --> 01:05.106
and then photocopy it
Lisa: Seriously?

01:05.106 --> 01:08.652
Gerry: Yeah
Lisa: I finished mine weeks

01:08.652 --> 01:11.030
ago, both versions.
Gerry: Both versions?

01:11.030 --> 01:13.032
Why would you do two versions
Lisa: Because when I was a

01:13.032 --> 01:16.243
student teacher, I had a student
call in a bomb threat and I had

01:16.243 --> 01:18.078
to evacuate and I had to
write a whole new one

01:18.078 --> 01:21.373
Gerry: Well, I don't have enough
time for versions and I don't

01:21.373 --> 01:23.959
have enough photocopies in my
account, so I'm going to do 1

01:23.959 --> 01:26.003
version.
Bobbi: I don't even have to

01:26.003 --> 01:28.505
write exams,
'cause I'm a phys ed teacher.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.841
Gerry: That's great, congrats
Lisa: Ok, so how are you gonna

01:30.841 --> 01:33.134
get this done by tomorrow?
Gerry: I'll go home, finish the

01:33.134 --> 01:36.764
exam I'll stay up late I'll get
up early and I'll photocopy it.
Done!

01:36.764 --> 01:38.557
Bobbi: Yeah, ya know what?
I'm gonna stay up late too,

01:38.557 --> 01:40.099
but I'm going to
stay up so I can watch

01:40.099 --> 01:43.437
the game 'cause I'm a
Phys Ed teacher...soooo

01:43.437 --> 01:44.939
Gerry: Why does she do that? I
want to be a Phys Ed teacher and

01:44.939 --> 01:47.024
she's rubbing it in my
face like I don't need

01:47.024 --> 01:50.694
her to rub it in my face
like that... It's mean.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.154
Gerry: Continue to work on
those questions at the back

01:53.154 --> 01:56.033
Lewis: Sir, is there any way we
can get like a hint on what

01:56.033 --> 01:58.243
might be on the exam?
Gerry: Everything, ok?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.203
Everything we've covered,
everything we've talked

02:00.203 --> 02:03.749
about to this point and more.
Lewis: But, like what kind of
questions?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.501
Gerry: Some short answer, some

02:06.501 --> 02:09.254
matching maybe, some
essay, some lists...

02:09.254 --> 02:10.923
Lewis: How about
multiple choice?

02:10.923 --> 02:13.968
Gerry: Wow, a lot of questions
Lewis, for a new kid that just

02:13.968 --> 02:16.261
transferred, 'cause multiple
choice is easy to cheat

02:16.261 --> 02:19.180
isn't it? Way ahead of you, I
know about you and your brother

02:19.180 --> 02:22.476
Clarke, so I'll be watching,
good luck trying to cheat.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.312
Lewis: I would never
dream of cheating.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.606
Gerry: No, you wouldn't, that's
why you have a million questions

02:27.606 --> 02:30.442
Ben: Sir, did ah, did you
ever cheat in school?

02:30.442 --> 02:33.361
Gerry: Let's just say, I know
all the tricks Benjamin, ok?

02:33.361 --> 02:37.825
Alright? Cell phones, not
allowed. Talking, not allowed

02:37.825 --> 02:40.995
extra paper, there will be no
washroom breaks, calculators are

02:40.995 --> 02:43.705
fine. If you want to bring
calculator to the exam, bring a

02:43.705 --> 02:46.875
calculator.
Ben: Sir, why would we need a

02:46.875 --> 02:50.253
calculator for a history exam?
Gerry: Benjamin, tell me this...

02:50.253 --> 02:54.424
How many years between the end
of World War One in 1918

02:54.424 --> 02:57.552
and the start of
World War Two in 1939?

02:57.552 --> 03:03.058
Ben: 21.
Gerry: Twenty...21.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.810
What if I ask you how many
months then between...

03:04.810 --> 03:07.688
Maya: 252
Gerry: Thank you Rain Woman.

03:07.688 --> 03:12.651
If I ever see anyone write the
word boobless in the calculator

03:12.651 --> 03:16.446
you will be expelled,
disgusting, funny joke for

03:16.446 --> 03:18.824
some of you, disgusting for me.

03:23.495 --> 03:28.207
Dwyer: Thanks guys, just
leave it over there.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.878
OK, everybody knows my father
recently passed away

03:30.878 --> 03:33.047
Lisa: We were so sorry
to hear about that

03:33.047 --> 03:35.883
Dwyer: Thanks, anyway this
foosball table was his,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.509
I want to give you guys a gift.
Bobbi: You sure you can part

03:37.509 --> 03:39.636
with it Paul?
Dwyer: My father always said, if

03:39.636 --> 03:41.471
you're not sharing, you're
not really playing, so.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.683
Bobbi: Oh, yes.
Simon: Good Morning everyone.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.727
Foosball, wow! Where
did this come from?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.063
Dwyer: It's my dad's.
Simon: Wow, this is great.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.482
Let me look at this, move out of
the way Dwyer, cool.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.527
This is a good foosball table.
Who want's to play me? You
Dwyer?

03:55.527 --> 03:58.155
Dwyer: No, no I just...
Simon: I promise you, you do not

03:58.155 --> 04:00.782
Sir I will bury you. I will bury
you underground and watch you
rot.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.367
-Simon?
-Bones in a casket by the

04:02.367 --> 04:04.119
Simon:time I'm done with you man
Lisa: Simon

04:04.119 --> 04:05.871
Simon: Which team do you want to
be? Want to be red like the

04:05.871 --> 04:08.123
massacre that's about to ensue?
Or blue like the corpse I'm

04:08.123 --> 04:10.542
going to turn you into? Do we
have a priest on hand to deliver

04:10.542 --> 04:14.629
Mr Dwyer his last rites?
Funeral march out of the staff
room.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.591
Lisa: SIMON! His father just

04:17.591 --> 04:23.263
passed away and this table
belonged to him.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.224
Simon: You want to play?
Bobbi: Yeah, but just a quick

04:25.224 --> 04:28.268
game ok? And make it respectful.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.519
Gerry: Sir.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.526
Stupid machine!

04:36.526 --> 04:38.528
Need a little help
there do you Gerry?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.321
No, this machine won't collate
and I can't figure it out.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.865
Trudy: You know it's a poor
workman

04:41.865 --> 04:44.076
that blames his tools.
Gerry: What does that mean?

04:44.076 --> 04:47.037
Trudy: It's a proverb Gerry. It
means you gotta stop blaming the

04:47.037 --> 04:51.083
photocopier.
Gerry: Oh, just say that.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.751
Trudy, here's what I need...

04:55.670 --> 04:57.589
...put more copies in my account

04:57.589 --> 04:59.633
Trudy: I can't do that
Gerry: Why?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.927
Trudy: Because it's a budget
thing, I do that for you

05:01.927 --> 05:03.845
I have to do it for everybody.
Gerry: I can't get through

05:03.845 --> 05:07.682
another month without, I I can't
even copy the exams with this

05:07.682 --> 05:10.060
Trudy: You ruined enough
copies for like 10 exams.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.104
Gerry: Yeah
Trudy: You gotta learn how to

05:12.104 --> 05:14.731
work that thing Gerry. Do you
know what you can do?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.943
Borrow from another staff member
Gerry: Who?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.820
Trudy: Leung
Gerry: Leung?!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.947
Trudy: Yeah! He's got tons!
Gerry: He's a weirdo.

05:21.947 --> 05:26.243
Trudy: It's pronounced librarian
Gerry: Trudy, I need the copies

05:26.243 --> 05:28.369
I don't have enough copies
How about, how about giving me

05:28.369 --> 05:30.455
some of your, your
own from your account.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.876
Trudy: Please learn how to use
that machine Gerry.
I'm begging you.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.295
Learn how to use it.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.469
Gerry: Trudy can you help
me with this at all or...?

05:44.469 --> 05:48.932
Trudy: No, sorry.
Moulder of young minds.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.851
Gerry: Need another copier here.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.061
You need to spend some money
and get a new copier.

05:53.061 --> 05:57.899
Gerry: Ok, you have 180 marks.
Please wait til I have handed

05:57.899 --> 06:01.028
these out before you get started
keep your eyes on your own exam

06:01.028 --> 06:06.574
do not start until I tell you
and good luck. Get started.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.828
If you have any question raise
your hand and I will come to you

06:09.828 --> 06:11.496
Lewis:Can we write on both sides
Gerry: Ok I just said if you

06:11.496 --> 06:13.581
have a question Lewis, raise
your hand.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.416
No, you cannot write
on the back.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.212
Just write on the
space that I have provided
there on the front.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.671
Maya: What if we run out
of room on the one side?

06:19.671 --> 06:21.464
Gerry: Seriously everybody

06:21.464 --> 06:23.967
really need you to raise your
hand during an exam if you have

06:23.967 --> 06:28.680
a question. Do not write on the
back of the paper. Thank you.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.557
Ben: That was a really
bad waste of paper.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.433
Gerry: Ok, that wasn't a
question, that was a comment.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.812
A wasted comment. Look, if you
write on both sides, when I mark

06:35.812 --> 06:39.524
these I gotta mark it and I have
to flip it over and then I have

06:39.524 --> 06:42.277
to flip it over, and then I do
this and then I gotta go back to

06:42.277 --> 06:44.445
this side and flip it. It takes
forever. So if you want these

06:44.445 --> 06:47.782
back in a month, then
you can write on the back.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.451
Is this a question?
Jimmy: Yes it is.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.038
Gerry: Go ahead.
Jimmy: Don't you always take at

06:53.038 --> 06:54.873
least a month to hand our stuff?
Gerry: That's not a question

06:54.873 --> 06:56.624
that's a comment.
Jimmy: No, that was a question.

06:56.624 --> 07:00.837
Gerry: No, that was a dig.
Thanks to Jimmy and Lewis and

07:00.837 --> 07:03.965
Maya and Ben you now have 85
minutes to write the exam.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.929
Something interesting about the
time there, Lewis?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.014
Lewis: What? No!
Gerry: Yeah, bring it up here

07:11.014 --> 07:15.185
please. I'm not an idiot.

07:15.185 --> 07:19.064
If I catch anyone talking or
looking or cheating

07:19.064 --> 07:22.692
if I suspect you're cheating,
you'll get zero.

07:22.692 --> 07:27.572
(Fire alarm sounds)
Gerry: Oh, ah don't look, don't

07:27.572 --> 07:29.908
stop looking please,
stop looking and...

07:38.917 --> 07:41.211
Lisa: Hey, umm...

07:41.211 --> 07:44.047
so I'm gonna guess that you
didn't do that second version

07:44.047 --> 07:47.467
of the exam that I suggested.
Gerry: No, glad you're not smug

07:47.467 --> 07:49.636
about it.
Lisa: Good luck with that.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.471
Robert: I'll try and get
everyone back inside

07:51.471 --> 07:55.100
as quickly as possible. At times
like this you really realize how

07:55.100 --> 07:58.437
fleeting life is huh? How
vulnerable we truly are.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.481
Gerry: There they are.
Robert: Do you know what I mean?

08:01.481 --> 08:06.111
Gerry: Looky, looky Lewis and
Clarke. Nice trick boys.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.780
Lewis: Um, trick? We didn't...
that wasn't us.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.658
Gerry: ...pull the fire alarm?
Get the exam delayed, give you

08:11.658 --> 08:14.161
some more time to study, you
better hope it's a real fire in

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
there, that's all I can say.
Callaghan: What did you say?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.747
Clarke: Why would we hope that?
Lewis: That is, that's just

08:17.747 --> 08:19.540
horrible.
Gerry: No, you missed, you

08:19.540 --> 08:22.543
missed the whole beginning
of the conversation

08:22.543 --> 08:26.547
Callaghan: I'm listening.
Gerry: What I was gonna

08:26.547 --> 08:29.676
Robert: False alarm everybody,
back inside, coast is clear.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.969
Gerry: False alarm. Ok I'm glad
to hear that.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.846
Tuck your shirt in,
fix your tie.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.807
Gerry: Close call Sir.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.021
Bill: Hey man, you're not
done that exam yet or what?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.318
Gerry: For me to explain this,
all this, books, learning to you

08:46.318 --> 08:49.029
right now is going to be way
over a bartenders head, ok?

08:49.029 --> 08:53.492
I wrote my exam. I have to
rewrite the same exam.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.285
Bill: Why don't you just
use the same one?

08:55.285 --> 08:58.372
Gerry: Why don't I just reheat
uneaten chicken wings and serve

08:58.372 --> 09:00.332
them to a different customer?
Bill: You know that's not the

09:00.332 --> 09:02.125
same thing, right?
Gerry: I know it's not, it's a

09:02.125 --> 09:04.336
metaphor Bill.
Bill: Actually it's an analogy.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.839
Gerry: Ok, anyway the point this
is way over your head

09:07.839 --> 09:09.924
Bill: The lazier a man is, the
more he plans to do tomorrow

09:09.924 --> 09:15.263
right? Proverb
Gerry: Right that is a...proverb

09:15.263 --> 09:16.348
Bill: You should put that
on the exam

09:16.348 --> 09:17.557
Gerry: Mmmm

09:21.978 --> 09:26.107
Was it cold during the cold war?

09:32.572 --> 09:37.660
Malik: Gerary! Sunshine morning!
Gerry: Hey, come here Malik

09:37.660 --> 09:40.997
Do they gi, do they give you
a photocopy account?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.624
Malik: Give me copies?
Gerry: No.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.626
Malik: You need copies?
Gerry: I need copies.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.671
Malik: They come, copies making,
punch, punch, punch and then

09:48.671 --> 09:53.468
forgot and leave. Gerundy,
copies Gerry: Teachers don't
punch out.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.720
Malik: Ohhh!
Gerry: They don't punch out!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.765
Punch out their code, they don't
punch out their code so you come

09:58.765 --> 10:01.851
and take...for your yard sale.
Malik: Yard Sale!! Yard Sale!

10:01.851 --> 10:04.521
Malik: Yard sale, you coming to
yard sale? I make bushkies

10:04.521 --> 10:07.148
I steal all yard sale, steal
Gerry: Aw jeez, that's 1 way

10:07.148 --> 10:09.859
to get copies, I guess.
Malik: Mmhmm, just watch, punch

10:09.859 --> 10:12.946
Gerry: Ok, alright
Malik: You can do (whistles)

10:12.946 --> 10:16.199
Malik: Gerandy!
Gerry: I just did what you said

10:16.199 --> 10:22.705
people do...thanks!
Malik: No punch

10:22.705 --> 10:28.378
1-2-2-1, I like
Gerary, I just make one.

10:33.258 --> 10:38.972
Bobbi: Goin' down!! Nice!
Dwyer: Hey guys!

10:38.972 --> 10:41.808
You havin' a good time with...
Bobbi: Hey! Yeah, it's awesome.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.102
You enjoying it, huh?
Simon: Bobbu is about to die a

10:44.102 --> 10:46.854
miserable death, sorry Dwyer
Bobbi: Well that's not something

10:46.854 --> 10:49.274
Dwyer: Last time I saw my dad he
was standing right where you're

10:49.274 --> 10:50.984
standing Bobbi.
Bobbie: Is that right?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.902
Dwyer: Yeah, I was supposed to
call him the night he passed

10:52.902 --> 10:59.700
away, but I was too busy. All I
gotta say is just make time guys

10:59.700 --> 11:01.077
Bobbi: That's something
Simon: Two.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.370
Dwyer: Just try to make time.

11:05.624 --> 11:09.252
Simon: Three.
Bobbi: I can't really, I can't

11:09.252 --> 11:12.922
really play this anymore.
Simon: Why, what happened?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.048
Where you going?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.259
Forfeit, forfeit.

11:18.677 --> 11:22.599
Malik: Gawee!
Leung: I will see you there.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.730
Gerry: Ni hou ma?
Leung: I'm doing fine thank you

11:29.730 --> 11:32.066
Gerry: Listen Wayne, I
understand that you have a lot

11:32.066 --> 11:35.069
of copies right now in your
account and I'm wondering if I

11:35.069 --> 11:38.532
could maybe borrow your account.
Grab some copies.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.950
Leung: No,
Gerry: So you're not going to

11:40.950 --> 11:45.330
give me any of your copies?
Leung: No, I am not.

11:45.330 --> 11:49.459
Gerry: What does that
do to your inventory?

11:49.459 --> 11:50.585
How about this?

11:58.801 --> 12:02.138
Just returned you,
check your computer.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.311
Simon: Just one game.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.771
Gerry. A little foosball to
start your day.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.400
Gerry: Where did we get this?
Simon: Dwyer's dead dad.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.237
Gerry: Oh really? Love foosball!
Simon: Yeah.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.614
Gerry: No, I gotta go,
I gotta get some copies.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.991
Simon: You need copies eh?
Play you for them.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.160
Gerry: Why don't you just
give me some copies?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.162
Simon: Come on, where's
the fun in that?

12:26.162 --> 12:29.165
Gerry: Oh, you want to play
foosball for photocopies?

12:29.165 --> 12:31.209
Simon: Sure
Gerry: If I win I get as many as

12:31.209 --> 12:33.420
I need.
Simon: Ok and if I win we hang

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
out for a night...
Gerry: No, that's not happening.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.674
Simon: Drinks.
Gerry: Okay, you buy.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.384
Simon: Deal, k happy
Gerry: Let's be quick, I have

12:39.384 --> 12:41.302
very little time.
Dwyer: Hey guys!

12:41.302 --> 12:44.138
Simon: (whispers) Oh no!
Gerry: Sorry about your dad.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.224
Dwyer: That's cool, things
happen but you know my dad

12:46.224 --> 12:50.228
really loved this table ok? He
had one silly rule

12:50.228 --> 12:54.190
that no one could touch his
favourite player.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.025
Gerry: That player. Well then
we should honour that rule.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.529
Dwyer: Thanks Gerry!
Gerry: Ok, out of respect for

12:59.529 --> 13:01.531
Gerry: his father...yeah
Dwyer: I really appreciate it.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.575
Simon: That's my goalie.
Gerry: I know, but.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.577
Dwyer: You guys don't mind if
I watch though eh?

13:05.577 --> 13:09.038
Gerry: No, stay, watch we're
having a little wager here.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.542
Gerry: Cheer us on! Let's go! I
don't know how you're going to

13:12.542 --> 13:14.335
do this with the goalie.
Anyway...

13:14.335 --> 13:17.297
Simon: You know what? I don't
need my goalie, because I'm not

13:17.297 --> 13:20.174
even playing against you. As
they say "You don't play against

13:20.174 --> 13:22.969
your opponent you play against
yourself and your own

13:22.969 --> 13:26.973
higher goals...and standards
on your route

13:26.973 --> 13:31.311
to becoming the best and that is
real joy" end of quote.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.188
Gerry: Nobody ever said that
Dwyer: No, no my dad always used

13:34.188 --> 13:36.483
to say that.
Simon: No he didn't! Come on!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.359
I made that up
Gerry: No his dad said it.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.612
Simon: No, that's ridiculous.
He's making up things about his

13:40.612 --> 13:42.489
dad for sympathy.
Dwyer: Excuse me.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.407
Gerry: That's so insensitive.
Simon: Dwyer, please. I'm sorry.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.950
Gerry: We are playing,
you made a bet.

13:45.950 --> 13:51.372
Simon: Without a goalie? Get off
of me. Dwyer!?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.671
Gerry: You may begin. By the
way I had to photocopy these
myself

13:57.671 --> 14:02.216
with my own money, because the
school does not give me enough

14:02.216 --> 14:06.012
photocopies. So you may
notice the size 8 font

14:06.012 --> 14:09.724
just to help save some costs,
cut down on paper. Funny story,

14:09.724 --> 14:12.644
actually, when I first got my
copy account I never even...

14:12.644 --> 14:13.894
Ben: Sir, we don't
have a lot of time.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.980
You have 90 minutes.
Plenty of time.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.315
Jimmy's done in like 15.

14:21.486 --> 14:25.239
I just have to step out
for a second, but

14:25.239 --> 14:26.907
just keep working quietly.

14:26.907 --> 14:31.871
I might be gone for a couple
minutes...be right back.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.299
Simon: Hey, is this
seat taken here?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.807
Look, I know what you're going
through. It's hard to say

14:50.807 --> 14:53.810
goodbye to a father.
Dwyer: You're telling me.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.021
It's so hard.
Simon: I know. Like, me and my

14:57.021 --> 15:02.235
dad had the greatest fishing
trip this weekend. We never

15:02.235 --> 15:04.904
catch anything but we always
have the greatest time. I don't

15:04.904 --> 15:08.408
know what I'd do without him.
Dwyer: Why'd you come here?

15:08.408 --> 15:11.035
Simon: All I'm saying is that if
I ever did lose my father,

15:11.035 --> 15:14.455
God forbid, that would be the
worst thing in the world.

15:14.455 --> 15:19.419
to happen to me, personally.
I'd cry, but if I ever did,

15:19.419 --> 15:24.340
he wouldn't want me to stop
fishing and he wouldn't want me

15:24.340 --> 15:30.054
to ruin fishing for anyone else.
Dwyer: I understand.

15:30.054 --> 15:36.603
Yeah, I gotta go put the goalie
back in the net. Thanks Simon.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.690
Simon: We're still talking about
your dead dad right?

15:40.690 --> 15:41.900
'Cause I don't know what
happened at the end of

15:41.900 --> 15:44.402
that conversation.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.282
Gerry: 45 minutes left
everybody, 45 minutes.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.409
(fire alarm sounds)
Gerry: No, no, no, no,

15:51.409 --> 15:54.328
sit, sit, sit, sit! It's another
false alarm. Nobody's going

15:54.328 --> 15:56.539
anywhere this time.
Ben: How do you know?

15:56.539 --> 15:59.709
Gerry: I know, I have a hunch,
isn't that right Lewis? Huh?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.419
Isn't that right?
A little hunch.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.879
Lewis: Sir, this isn't me.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.180
Gerry: Keep...
Robert: Mr. Duncan! This is not

16:13.180 --> 16:14.974
a drill.
Gerry: It's a drill everybody,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.811
ignore him. It is a drill.
Ben: Are you sure it's a drill?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.855
Gerry: I'm 100% sure, keep
going, this is a drill, just

16:20.855 --> 16:23.274
keep writing.
Robert: Mr Duncan! you have to

16:23.274 --> 16:25.151
evacuate your students
immediately!

16:25.151 --> 16:27.987
Gerry: No, no that's what Lewis
wants. We are not evacuating.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.031
Keep writing.
Maya: Sir! It's starting to

16:31.031 --> 16:33.534
feel real.
Chief: Sir, open this door now!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.495
Gerry: No, he has to come,
that's what they do they have

16:35.495 --> 16:38.414
to get out of the hall, 'cause
they get bored out of their tree

16:38.414 --> 16:40.207
this is not real.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.422
Get out! It's real
I think it's real. Let's go

16:46.422 --> 16:48.299
It's real, come on, it's
real, it must be real.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.092
Callaghan: Thanks Barry,
I appreciate it.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.761
Chief: You're just lucky it
wasn't a real fire this time.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.471
Make sure it doesn't
happen again.

16:53.471 --> 16:57.767
Callaghan: I will.
Robert: We will.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.728
Callaghan: Not letting the kids
out of class during a fire alarm

17:00.728 --> 17:02.605
Duncan.
Robert: You're lucky we were

17:02.605 --> 17:04.106
able to get them out alive!
Gerry: It wasn't real.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.817
Robert: You didn't know
that at the time.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.361
Gerry: I knew that Sir, the
students pull the alarms to get

17:08.361 --> 17:10.446
out of exams. It's the
oldest trick in the book,

17:10.446 --> 17:12.532
these are brothers,
this is what they do.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.367
Callaghan: Not possible.
It's faulty wiring.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.995
Robert: Mr Duncan, what it comes
down to is this, you've given us

17:16.995 --> 17:18.621
no choice but to go
ahead and let you go.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.331
Callaghan: Robert!
Robert: What Sir, carry on with

17:20.331 --> 17:22.375
the firing.
Callaghan: Look, everyone gets

17:22.375 --> 17:27.547
edgy during exams but under no
circumstances can you keep the

17:27.547 --> 17:31.801
kids in the classroom during a
fire alarm. Do you understand?

17:31.801 --> 17:35.221
Gerry: I understand.
Robert: Do you?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.848
Gerry: I won't do it again.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.018
Gerry: Because of this exam
situation, the exam is now one

17:40.018 --> 17:42.896
question, and I will dictate the
question, it'll be worth 80

17:42.896 --> 17:47.984
marks. Here we go, let's write
it down and good luck. 80 marks.

17:47.984 --> 17:54.657
When...did...Columbus,

17:54.657 --> 17:56.034
nope change that, actually sorry

17:56.034 --> 17:58.160
I'm thinking of another,
cross that out.

17:59.954 --> 18:04.959
Where...in history...sorry,
that's not the question

18:04.959 --> 18:07.795
Here we go, ready? I got it.
This is it.

18:07.795 --> 18:15.177
What was World War II...
about?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.971
Question mark.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.266
What, what was World War II
about? Question mark.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.436
Maya: Isn't that a little broad?
Gerry: Yeah and that's the point

18:23.436 --> 18:30.276
is it's to give you some room to
to write it's 80 marks Maya, so

18:30.276 --> 18:33.487
Lewis?
Lewis: Um, do you want us to

18:33.487 --> 18:38.158
to focus on, on an aspect?
Or just all of it?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.870
Gerry: Just the whole thing, the
whole war from beginning to end

18:40.870 --> 18:44.832
What was it about? Was it about
people and stuff? Was it about

18:44.832 --> 18:48.252
death? I mean I don't want to
give you answers but I try not

18:48.252 --> 18:51.631
give away the answer, but take
your own spin on it, think

18:51.631 --> 18:56.010
use your minds. Jimmy?
Jimmy: Does it matter what

18:56.010 --> 18:57.929
colour pen we use?
Gerry: No, it doesn't matter,

18:57.929 --> 19:01.557
blue is fine, any colour Jimmy.
You don't even finish the exams

19:01.557 --> 19:04.727
I don't know...
Jimmy: You're right

19:04.727 --> 19:07.187
Bill: Ugh, there goes
your weekend eh? Marking?

19:07.187 --> 19:10.608
Gerry: Not really. Let me
explain how this works.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.319
If these were regular tests,
what I would do is find the

19:13.319 --> 19:16.322
smartest student, it's Maya and
I would mark hers first

19:16.322 --> 19:17.907
Gerry: And I would use
that as my answer key,

19:17.907 --> 19:20.200
but these are essay questions,
now if I were to read

19:20.200 --> 19:24.622
these it would take forever. So
I don't, so I look at their mark

19:24.622 --> 19:26.457
going into it ok? Like Maya,
where's Maya?

19:26.457 --> 19:29.002
has the highest mark in the
class, there she is.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.212
So that's my answer key.
Bill: Don't you already know the

19:32.212 --> 19:34.256
answers?
Gerry: Mmm, sometimes their's

19:34.256 --> 19:37.969
are better. I gotta give her a
good mark, a couple circles

19:37.969 --> 19:41.263
and then sometimes, too vague,
too vague that way I don't have

19:41.263 --> 19:43.599
her 100
Bill: Yeah, keep it realistic.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.227
Gerry: 96, I give her a little
more than she has going in

19:47.227 --> 19:50.106
that way she won't come
back and challenge me ok?

19:50.106 --> 19:54.861
Bill: Right that's a good system
Gerry:Jimmy Jimmy, look at Jimmy

19:54.861 --> 19:56.654
Nothing, garbage, waste of time
Bill: Right, nothing.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.572
Gerry: 33, there's some words
there, but I have no time to

19:58.572 --> 20:02.827
read them, so then I get angry.
Jimmy, ridiculous, this has got

20:02.827 --> 20:04.829
to stop.
Bill: He could say the same

20:04.829 --> 20:06.789
thing to you.
Gerry: Ok? You got the system?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.375
Bill: Yeah, good system buddy.
Gerry: You do those ones.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.545
Bill: You want me to mark them?
Gerry: You don't really mark,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.588
Bill: Alright
Gerry: you just put marks on it

20:14.588 --> 20:17.133
Gerry: you put a circle...
Bill: That seems good...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.259
Bill: I'm a forger.
Gerry: Ok, here's Mike

20:19.259 --> 20:21.512
Now, Mike's got a 62
Bill: You should give him an 80

20:21.512 --> 20:25.183
Gerry: Give him an 80 make his
day, ok? And he goes home, his

20:25.183 --> 20:27.476
parents are excited,
I like that, finally!

20:27.476 --> 20:29.103
Bill: You've been rooting
for him the whole time.

20:29.103 --> 20:33.440
Gerry: Yeah! About time. Thank
you. This person, Shawna

20:33.440 --> 20:37.153
I don't like her. Drives me
nuts, so what I do is I fail her

20:37.153 --> 20:40.198
on the exam, but I just give
her enough to pass the course

20:40.198 --> 20:42.408
so I don't have to teach her
again. So it's like a lot of

20:42.408 --> 20:45.411
check marks and question marks,
underline some things, a couple

20:45.411 --> 20:47.205
good comments.
Bill: Mediocre.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.083
Gerry: I haven't used
that one, happy face, smile

20:50.083 --> 20:53.961
Bill: That's uh, disturbing.
Gerry: You are almost a teacher.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.636
Maya: Mr. Duncan?
Gerry: Ah, here we go...

21:02.636 --> 21:04.764
Yes, Maya?
Maya: I have a question about

21:04.764 --> 21:07.683
the exams you gave back.
Gerry: Ok, that's a surprise.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.353
Maya: You wrote "too vague" on
my paper, I don't know where or

21:11.353 --> 21:13.064
what you're even talking about

21:15.315 --> 21:17.401
Gerry: Did I do that?

21:17.401 --> 21:22.240
Hmm, too vague...you don't think
your answer was too vague?

21:22.240 --> 21:26.953
Maya: No, I think
I did a great job.

21:26.953 --> 21:32.917
Gerry: Alright, alright, let's
get it a little higher there 99.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.877
Maya: Thank you.
Gerry: You're welcome.

21:34.877 --> 21:38.256
Maya: But, can you tell me
