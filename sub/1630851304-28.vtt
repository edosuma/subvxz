WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:03.517
Julie: IT'S DOUBLE EVICTION

00:03.551 --> 00:08.034
NIGHT AND THAT COULD MEAN ONLY
ONE THING, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

00:08.068 --> 00:10.724
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

00:10.758 --> 00:14.137
Julie: PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG
BROTHER."

00:14.172 --> 00:20.103
THE COOKOUT HAD ONE MISSION, TO
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL SIX.

00:20.137 --> 00:26.034
AFTER HAND PICKING WHO LEFT WEEK
AFTER WEEK, CLAIRE WAS THEIR

00:26.068 --> 00:29.068
NEXT TARGET.

00:29.103 --> 00:31.379
CLAIRE IS-- I THOUGHT SHE
SHOULD GO FIRST.

00:31.413 --> 00:34.655
BUT CLAIRE'S BEST FRIEND AND
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TIFFANY HAD

00:34.689 --> 00:35.275
OTHER PLANS.

00:35.310 --> 00:36.344
I WANT CLAIRE TO STAY.

00:36.379 --> 00:38.931
AND I CAME UP WITH A MASTER
PLAN.

00:38.965 --> 00:40.862
AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO KEEP MY PERSON.

00:40.896 --> 00:43.482
Announcer: SO SHE TARGETED
ALYSSA INSTEAD.

00:43.517 --> 00:48.793
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ALYSSA
AND YOU XAVIER.

00:48.827 --> 00:52.793
Announcer: AT A MICROVETO
COMPETITION, ALYSSA GOT A BIG

00:52.827 --> 00:53.827
VICTORY.

00:53.862 --> 00:57.034
I AM SO EXCITED BECAUSE I AM
SAFE THIS WEEK.

00:57.068 --> 01:00.413
Announcer: LEAVING TIFFANY
CAUGHT BETWEEN A COOKOUT AND A

01:00.448 --> 01:01.689
CLAIRE.

01:01.724 --> 01:04.379
I MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE
COOKOUT AND IF I GO AGAINST THEM

01:04.413 --> 01:07.448
NOW, MY CHANCES OF WINNING THIS
GAME ARE SHOT.

01:07.482 --> 01:11.793
Announcer: KNOWING WHAT
NEEDED TO BE DONE, TIFFANY MADE

01:11.827 --> 01:14.965
A HEARTFELT CONFESSION TO HER
CLOSEST CONFIDANTE.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.896
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON
TO SEND OUT-- .

01:23.931 --> 01:28.034
SO MANY PEOPLE WON'T GET IT,
BUT I GET IT.

01:28.068 --> 01:29.896
Announcer: AT THE VETO
MEETING.

01:29.931 --> 01:34.034
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.

01:34.068 --> 01:38.379
Announcer: TIFF CHOSE THE
COOKOUT OVER HER BEST FRIEND.

01:38.413 --> 01:43.241
CLAIRE, I'M CHOOSING TO
REPLACE MY NOMINATION WITH YOU.

01:43.275 --> 01:48.793
Announcer: TONIGHT CLAIRE
OR XAVIER WILL BE SENT TO JURY

01:48.827 --> 01:52.068
BUT THEY WON'T BE ALONE BECAUSE
IT'S DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT,

01:52.103 --> 01:55.689
BABY, WILL THE COOKOUT MAKE
HISTORY AND COMPLETE THEIR

01:55.724 --> 01:56.620
MISSION?

01:56.655 --> 02:10.862
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW, LIVE ON "BIG
BROTHER".

02:10.896 --> 02:15.448
Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M
JULIE CHEN MOONVES, WELCOME TO

02:15.482 --> 02:16.689
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT.

02:16.724 --> 02:20.689
WE ARE LESS THAN THREE WEEKS
AWAY FROM CROWNING THE WINNER OF

02:20.724 --> 02:21.965
"BIG BROTHER."

02:22.000 --> 02:24.793
AND TONIGHT THE SEASON LONG GOAL
OF THE COOKOUT ALLIANCE MAKING

02:24.827 --> 02:30.793
IT TO THE FINAL SIX COULD BE
REALIZED BUT IF EVERYTHING

02:30.827 --> 02:33.896
DOESN'T GO ACCORDING TO PLAN,
ONE OF THEM COULD BE HEADED TO

02:33.931 --> 02:35.103
THE JURY.

02:35.137 --> 02:38.344
SO WILL THE COOKOUT COMPLETE
THEIR MISSION OR WILL THEY BE

02:38.379 --> 02:41.551
FORCED TO EVICT ONE OF THEIR
OWN?

02:41.586 --> 02:43.413
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

02:43.448 --> 02:47.172
BUT FIRST CLAIRE MAY BE THE
TARGET FOR TONIGHT'S FIRST

02:47.206 --> 02:48.482
EVICTION.

02:48.517 --> 02:51.724
BUT THE HOUSE IS ALREADY MAKING
PLANS FOR WHO TO TAKE OUT NEXT.

02:51.758 --> 02:56.068
AND IT APPEARS NOBODY IS SAFE.

02:56.103 --> 03:04.620
THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

03:04.655 --> 03:09.758
I AM SO SHOCKED THAT TIFFANY
WAS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO PUT

03:09.793 --> 03:13.344
HER NUMBER ONE CLAIRE ON THE
BLOCK, SO POSITIVE THAT X IS

03:13.379 --> 03:16.172
GOING HOME, I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT XAVIER AND CAN I PULL ALL

03:16.206 --> 03:19.827
THE VOTES WE NEED AND XAVIER CAN
STAY AND SET UP THIS BEAUTIFUL

03:19.862 --> 03:26.517
BLINDSIDE FOR TIFFANY ON
THURSDAY.

03:26.551 --> 03:27.310
IT'S OKAY.

03:27.344 --> 03:29.931
I RESPECT WHAT TIFFANY IS
DOING.

03:29.965 --> 03:33.827
BUT IT STILL REALLY SUCKS THAT I
AM ON THE BLOCK AND IT REALLY,

03:33.862 --> 03:36.965
REALLY SUCKS THAT IT IS HER THAT
PUT ME THERE.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.758
I KNOW I HAVE AN UPHILL
BATTLE HERE.

03:40.793 --> 03:46.034
HAVING TO NOMINATE CLAIRE
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

03:46.068 --> 03:49.034
DIFFICULT THINGS I HAVE HAD TO
DO.

03:49.068 --> 03:59.689
BUT BEFORE THERE WAS A CLAIRE,
THERE WAS A MISSION.

03:59.724 --> 04:02.655
HOW IS EVERYBODY?

04:02.689 --> 04:06.034
GOOD, NOW FOCUSING ON-- I'M
LEAK THAT.

04:06.068 --> 04:07.758
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING.

04:07.793 --> 04:08.482
NEXT WEEK NOW.

04:08.517 --> 04:11.827
MAY I ASK SOMETHING FROM YOU.

04:11.862 --> 04:15.379
UH-HUH.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.620
ALYSSA,-- THURSDAY, WHO DO
YOU PREFER TO LEAVE?

04:17.655 --> 04:21.448
WHO DO YOU WANT?

04:21.482 --> 04:22.206
KYLAND.

04:22.241 --> 04:22.827
OKAY.

04:22.862 --> 04:23.206
AND WHO WOULD YOU WANT?

04:23.241 --> 04:24.413
TIFFANY.

04:24.448 --> 04:34.517
AFTER THIS WEEK, I AM LEANING
HEAVILY TO ONE INDIVIDUAL.

04:34.551 --> 04:38.172
TIFFANY AND I HAVE BEEN VERY
GOOD ALLIES IN THIS GAME PRETTY

04:38.206 --> 04:39.482
MUCH UP UNTIL THIS WEEK.

04:39.517 --> 04:43.344
IT IS JUST A LOT OF THINGS ARE
BEGINNING TO ADD UP WITH HOW

04:43.379 --> 04:46.379
SHE'S PLAYED THE GAME THIS WEEK
THAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE IN

04:46.413 --> 04:49.206
MY BEST INTEREST TO TAKE THAT
SHOT AT TIFFANY.

04:49.241 --> 04:58.448
I WANT TIFFANY OUT FIRST.

04:58.482 --> 05:01.275
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT, AND I
KNOW THIS IS NOT THE REASON WE

05:01.310 --> 05:07.517
ARE DOING THIS AT ALL, BUT IF
THIS THING FALLS THROUGH, THE

05:07.551 --> 05:11.206
FIEJ SEVEN ARE ALL MINORITIES.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.896
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

05:12.931 --> 05:15.517
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED.

05:15.551 --> 05:17.000
NEVER HAPPENED.

05:17.034 --> 05:17.827
OUT OF.

05:17.862 --> 05:20.379
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED.

05:20.413 --> 05:21.620
WAIT, WHAT?

05:21.655 --> 05:26.206
OH MY GOD, EVERYONE WHO IS LEFT,
IF CLAIRE GOES HOME WILL BE

05:26.241 --> 05:27.379
MINORITY?

05:27.413 --> 05:29.551
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

05:29.586 --> 05:33.551
TECHNICALLY I'M HALF WHITE SO
AM I NEXT?

05:33.586 --> 05:37.758
NO, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

05:37.793 --> 05:38.379
YES.

05:38.413 --> 05:39.586
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.

05:39.620 --> 05:42.206
I'M DONE WITH YOU ALYSSA, I'M
NOT TALKING WITH YOU FOR THE

05:42.241 --> 05:43.448
REST OF THE DAY.

05:43.482 --> 05:47.517
IF OUR PLANS WORK, THE TOP
SEVEN ARE ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR.

05:47.551 --> 05:48.517
WOW.

05:48.551 --> 05:49.206
THAT'S INSANE.

05:49.241 --> 05:50.379
WOW.

05:50.413 --> 05:53.448
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T
EVEN-- EVEN IF I AM IN JURY I

05:53.482 --> 05:58.275
WILL BE SO HAPPY KNOWING WHOEVER
WINS IS A PERSON OF COLOR.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.551
YES.

05:59.586 --> 06:01.655
YOU ARE IN LUCK BECAUSE THAT'S
EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE GOING NEXT

06:01.689 --> 06:03.586
WEEK.

06:03.620 --> 06:15.241
THAT IS-- WOW.

06:15.275 --> 06:19.551
MY PLAN IS TO ACTUALLY THROW
CLAIRE A SIM PATHEDY VOTE FOR A

06:19.586 --> 06:20.896
COUPLE OF REASONS.

06:20.931 --> 06:24.172
WHY, I NEED TO UPKEEP MY JURY
MANAGEMENT CONSIDERING THAT IS

06:24.206 --> 06:29.793
WHAT CLAIRE EXEPS ME TO DO AND
TWO, I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE

06:29.827 --> 06:35.551
PLANNED.

06:35.586 --> 06:51.517
WHAT?

06:51.551 --> 06:55.344
WE'RE ALMOST TO FINAL SIX BUT
IF ALYSSA WIN THIS NEXT H.O.H.,

06:55.379 --> 07:01.655
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ME,
TIFFANY AND AZAH ARE ALL SAFE.

07:01.689 --> 07:06.482
SO HOPEFULLY PINNING THE SOLE
VOTE ON KYLAND WILL ASSURE

07:06.517 --> 07:15.586
ALYSSA GOES AFTER KY AND NOT US
THREE.

07:15.620 --> 07:25.827
THE SMARTEST THING IS TO PUT
KY ON THE BLOCK.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.551
IT COULD BE A DOUBLE.

07:28.586 --> 07:33.275
YEAH, I MADE IT TO TOP SEVEN
BUT THAT ONLY GAVE ME AN EXTRA

07:33.310 --> 07:36.896
30 MINUTES BECAUSE I CAN TILL GO
HOME ON THURSDAY T IS JUST

07:36.931 --> 07:37.206
SCARY.

07:37.241 --> 07:38.448
YEAH.

07:38.482 --> 07:41.793
EVERYONE SHOULD BE PREPARED
TO BE LEAVING THIS HOUSE LATER

07:41.827 --> 07:42.965
TODAY.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.172
Julie: IT'S TIME FOR THE
FIRST EVICTION OF THE NIGHT.

07:45.206 --> 07:48.551
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND BREAK THE NEWS TO THE HOUSE

07:48.586 --> 07:49.206
DPESES.

07:49.241 --> 07:51.034
HELLO HOUSEGUESTS.

07:56.344 --> 07:59.448
Julie: CAN YOU HEAR ME
OKAY.

07:59.482 --> 07:59.965
YES.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.241
Julie: EXCELLENT.

08:01.275 --> 08:06.034

DEREK X AND SARAH BETH ARE ALL

08:06.068 --> 08:09.689
SITTING IN THE JURY HOUSE.

08:09.724 --> 08:13.241
AND TONIGHT EITHER XAVIER OR
CLAIRE WILL JOIN THEM.

08:13.275 --> 08:18.862
BUT THE JURY HOUSE IS ABOUT TO
GET EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE

08:18.896 --> 08:22.689
CROWDED BECAUSE TONIGHT TWO OF
YOU WILL BE JOINING THE JURY.

08:22.724 --> 08:23.965
TWO OF YOU.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.586
YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT HERE ON

08:27.620 --> 08:29.448
"BIG BROTHER."

08:29.482 --> 08:34.068
SO HOUSEGUESTS, YOU ARE ABOUT TO
EXPERIENCE A WHOLE WEEK'S WORTH

08:34.103 --> 08:35.827
OF "BIG BROTHER" IN ONE NIGHT.

08:35.862 --> 08:37.896
THAT IS AN EVICTION.

08:37.931 --> 08:43.241
AN H.O.H. COMPETITION,
NOMINATIONS, A VETO COMPETITION

08:43.275 --> 08:46.241
AROUND A-- AND A SECOND EVICTION
AND IT IS ALL HAPPENING LIVE.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.793
WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.103
SO XAVIER, CLAIRE, IN JUST
MOMENTS YOUR HOUSE MATES WILL

08:51.137 --> 08:53.172
CAST THEIR VOTE TO EVICT LIVE.

08:53.206 --> 08:57.137
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH
HAVE A FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY

08:57.172 --> 09:00.724
THEIR VOTE WITH ONE BRIEF
STATEMENT.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.241
XAVIER, YOU ARE FIRST.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.551
ALL RIGHT.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.413
FIRST AND FORE MOST TO MY FAMILY
AND FRIENDS WATCHING BACK HOME,

09:05.448 --> 09:09.482
I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND I
HOPE I HAVE MADE YOU PROUD.

09:09.517 --> 09:12.172
HOUSEGUESTS I HAVE DISCUSSED
WITH YOU ALL HOW KEEPING ME

09:12.206 --> 09:14.379
BENEFITS EACH OF YOUR GAME,
HOWEVER IF YOU DECIDE IT IS IN

09:14.413 --> 09:17.827
THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUR GAME
TO KEEP THIS LOVELY LADY SITTING

09:17.862 --> 09:20.793
TO MY LEFT, I UNDERSTAND AND
RESPECT YOUR DECISION, I WOULD

09:20.827 --> 09:23.517
JUST LIKE TO NOTE IF YOU DO VOTE
TO HE VIC ME I'M TAKING LIEU

09:23.551 --> 09:24.413
SHUS WITH ME.

Julie: THANK YOU, XAVIER,
CLAIRE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

09:29.896 --> 09:34.724
MOM, DAD, TAYLOR, ADDY, SETH
AND MAKAYLA AND ALL MY NEW YORK

09:34.758 --> 09:37.413
CITY AND MICHIGAN FRIENDS, I
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

09:37.448 --> 09:39.931
HOUSEGUESTS, I FIND MYSELF
ALMOST AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

09:39.965 --> 09:43.068
BECAUSE I'M SITTING NEXT TO THE
FABULOUS X AND IS HE LOYAL AND

09:43.103 --> 09:44.482
IS HE TRUST WORTHY.

09:44.517 --> 09:49.620
AND IN THREE WEEKS HE WILL BE
$750,000 RICHER BECAUSE FOR ME

09:49.655 --> 09:54.758
TO GO AND HIM TO STAY, HE MUST
BE PLAYING A DAMN FINE GAME.

09:54.793 --> 09:58.379
AND FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, YOU
KNOW, HAVE I TO TIP MY HAT TO

09:58.413 --> 10:01.517
HIM AND I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO
JURY, POTENTIALLY AND I WILL

10:01.551 --> 10:04.896
MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE JURY
KNOWS THAT AS WELL.

10:04.931 --> 10:07.344
AND WITH THAT, I SAY THANK YOU.

10:07.379 --> 10:09.965
AND ONE OF YOU MAY BE JOINING ME
VERY SOON.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Julie: THANK YOU BOTH.

10:11.034 --> 10:14.620
ALL RIGHT, NOW TIME FOR THE LIVE
VOTING TO BEGIN.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.793
TIFFANY, AS CURRENT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED

10:17.827 --> 10:18.482
TO VOTE.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.413
NEITHER ARE THE TWO NOMINEES.

10:21.448 --> 10:23.965
ONE AT A TIME, THE REST OF YOU
WILL ENTER THE DIARY ROOM AND

10:24.000 --> 10:28.379
CAST YOUR VOTE TO EVICT.

10:28.413 --> 10:37.896
ALYSSA, YOU ARE UP FIRST, PLEASE
GO TO THE DIARY ROOM.

10:37.931 --> 10:40.448
XAVIER IS ALYSSA'S CLOSEST ALLY.

10:40.482 --> 10:44.000
IT WOULD BE A SHOCK IF SHE VOTED
TO EVICT HIM.

10:44.034 --> 10:44.758
HELLO ALYSSA.

10:44.793 --> 10:45.655

BIRTHDAY, CHRISTIAN.

10:54.689 --> 10:58.896
Julie: HANNAH'S PLAN IS TO
CAST HER VOTE TO EVICT XAVIER

10:58.931 --> 11:01.689
BUT PUT KYLAND'S FINGERPRINTS ON
IT.

11:01.724 --> 11:03.551
WILL SHE FOLLOW THROUGH?

11:03.586 --> 11:04.344

XAVIER AND KYLAND.

11:18.517 --> 11:23.068
HIS VOTE WILL MOST LIKELY
REFLECT THAT PACT.

11:23.103 --> 11:24.517
HELLO BIG DRK.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.586
HEY JULIE WHAT IS UP, BABY.

Julie: AZAH HAS MADE IT HER
MISSION TO GET THE COOKOUT TO

11:41.827 --> 11:43.931
THE FINAL SICK.

11:43.965 --> 11:46.620
TAKING OUT CLAIRE WILL GET HER
ONE STEP CLOSER.

11:46.655 --> 11:47.206
HELLO AZAH.

13:34.793 --> 13:38.000
YOU THAT SHE HAD TO NOMINATE
YOU.

13:38.034 --> 13:42.655
BASICALLY SHE WAS SAYING THAT
SHE COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

13:42.689 --> 13:46.034
A PERP OF COLOR BEING EVICTED.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.275
YEAH.

13:47.310 --> 13:51.241

SITTING HERE WITH ME NOW, DO YOU
STILL GET IT?

13:53.827 --> 13:55.517
I DO.

13:55.551 --> 13:59.068
Julie: WHY?

13:59.103 --> 14:02.448
THERE'S BEEN -- THIS GAME HAS
BEEN PLAYED FOR A LONG TIME.

14:02.482 --> 14:04.896
AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE OF
COLOR AREN'T LOOKED OUT FOR IN

14:04.931 --> 14:05.448
THE GAME.

14:05.482 --> 14:09.068
AND THEY GO OUT EARLY.

14:09.103 --> 14:12.344

DO WHAT SHE HAD TO DO, WHAT SHE

14:12.379 --> 14:14.655
SAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
COMING HERE.

AND IT IS AWFUL THAT I AM HERE,
AND I WISH I WASN'T.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.241

TIFFANY FOR STICKING TO WHAT SHE

14:23.172 --> 14:24.620
BELIEVES IN.

I THINK THAT HE IS PLAYING THE
PEST GAME IN THERE.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.034

HIMSELF VERY, VERY NICELY WHERE

14:49.068 --> 14:51.241
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING OUT
FOR HIM.

14:51.275 --> 14:55.517

39:37.344 --> 39:38.655
PERSON I TOLD EVERYONE TO.

HERE AND THERE TO GAIN MORE

39:41.172 --> 39:44.413
LOYALTY BUT THE KINGS ARE ALWAYS
PEOPLE THEY'RE WANTING OUT SO I

39:44.448 --> 39:47.000

INDIVIDUAL GAME, I WANT TO BE
