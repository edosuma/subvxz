00:20.501 --> 00:23.200
 Oh, this is <i>way too
much country for me.</i>

00:23.300 --> 00:24.534
<laughing>

00:24.634 --> 00:27.901
Come on, city boy, a little
fresh air never hurt anybody.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.133
It's not the air
that's bothering me.

00:30.234 --> 00:32.534
  <i>Shal, Brennan,
  <i>you in position yet?</i></i>

00:32.634 --> 00:34.167
  Oh, it's hard to say.

00:34.267 --> 00:35.601
 We're in the middle
of a corn field.

00:35.701 --> 00:36.868
 Well, check your coordinates.

00:36.968 --> 00:38.801
Yeah, don't worry, Lex.
We're in the right spot.

00:38.901 --> 00:42.767
 You know, it's been over an
 hour, and there's still no sign
 of your whistle-blower.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.734
I'm beginning to
think he bailed.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.234
Let's give him ten more.

00:46.334 --> 00:48.100
This better be <i>some whistle.</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:51.367
Well, according to the Dominion,
 he's got proof of an upcoming
genetic disaster.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.501
 Are you sure you don't
 see anything at all?

00:53.601 --> 00:55.934
Yeah, well, a whole lot of corn.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.300
  And bugs.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.200
<laughing>

01:01.300 --> 01:03.267
Damn, that's
 a big grasshopper.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.400
It's a locust.

01:11.501 --> 01:16.434
 Yeah, well, whatever it is
  just... keep it away from me.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.167
Do you hear that?

01:21.267 --> 01:23.601
Guys, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:25.901 --> 01:27.367
  Ah, it's nothing.

01:27.467 --> 01:28.834
 It's just the wind.

01:28.934 --> 01:30.601
That's not the wind.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.734
Let's move!

01:42.367 --> 01:43.567
 What the hell's that?

01:43.667 --> 01:46.501
Locusts!
Thousands of them!

01:46.601 --> 01:48.501
 They're all over us!

01:51.801 --> 01:53.968
 Guys, what's happening?

01:54.067 --> 02:03.534
<panting>

02:13.901 --> 02:16.834
They're dead.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.767
Every single
one of them.

02:18.868 --> 02:21.334
  That can't be good.

02:25.133 --> 02:26.567
 Gets worse.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.667
 I think we've found
 our informant.

02:41.601 --> 02:46.267
   <i>Scientist Adam Kane was a
  <i>pioneer of genetic research,</i></i>

02:46.367 --> 02:50.133
  <i>manipulating DNA to
   <i>save human lives.</i></i>

02:50.234 --> 02:53.567
 <i>But in many, their genes
  <i>unexpectedly mutated</i></i>

02:53.667 --> 02:56.868
   <i>and they developed
  <i>superhuman abilities.</i></i>

03:26.334 --> 03:29.100
   <i>Together, four of the most
   <i>powerful fight to protect</i></i>

03:29.200 --> 03:32.501
  <i>a world that doesn't
  <i>even know they exist.</i></i>

03:34.601 --> 03:38.100
  <i>They are... Mutant X.</i>

03:41.767 --> 03:44.300
The smoke of
a giant furnace.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.133
From that smoke locusts
came down upon the earth,

03:48.234 --> 03:52.234
and they were given powers
like that of scorpions."

03:52.334 --> 03:56.033
Wow. Sounds like somebody did
some hard time in Sunday school.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.934
It's good
for the soul.

03:58.033 --> 04:02.701
So, you think those locusts are
the disaster your informant was
trying to tell us about?

04:02.801 --> 04:04.868
It's kind of hard to say
since he's not talking.

04:04.968 --> 04:06.300
Hmm.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.067
We'll just have to wait until
we hear from Dr. Bellows,

04:08.167 --> 04:10.100
Dominion's entomologist.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.167
You think he's
worth his salt?

04:13.267 --> 04:16.367
Well, from what I hear, if it
flies, crawls or squirms,

04:16.466 --> 04:18.801
 <u>she's</u> the one who can tell us
what we're dealing with.

04:18.901 --> 04:19.968
She?

04:20.067 --> 04:22.267
Hm.

04:22.367 --> 04:26.367
 Hm.

04:26.467 --> 04:31.634
I suspect it's a genetically
modified version of
 <i>Schistocerca Gregaria</i>

04:31.734 --> 04:33.067
The desert locust.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.701
The most aggressive and
voracious of the locust family.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.434
They're eating machines.

04:37.534 --> 04:39.434
  How do you know it's been
  genetically modified?

04:39.534 --> 04:41.100
Oh, honey,

04:41.200 --> 04:44.534
because there is simply
nothing this destructive
found in nature.

04:47.734 --> 04:49.234
How much do you weigh?

04:49.334 --> 04:50.167
Buck ninety?

04:50.267 --> 04:51.667
Two hundred?

04:53.234 --> 04:54.467
Never mind.

04:54.567 --> 04:57.767
The point is, this is not your
garden variety locust, okay?

04:57.868 --> 05:01.167
These are bred to resist
any kind of pesticides.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.534
 And from what we saw, pretty
healthy appetites, too.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.000
Oh, yeah.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.634
They feed on all kinds of crop
vegetation,

05:07.734 --> 05:10.067
corn, grain, wheat,
until there's nothing left.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.934
And you know what?

05:12.033 --> 05:16.667
By the looks of it, if their
reproductive system is
advanced as I think it is,

05:16.767 --> 05:21.534
these bugs have the potential
to create a national famine
like nothing you've ever seen.

05:21.634 --> 05:23.801
Why would someone even create
something like that?

05:23.901 --> 05:24.934
 Oh, who knows?

05:25.033 --> 05:28.567
An agro-terrorist or
random whack-job.

05:28.667 --> 05:29.734
But it doesn't
make sense.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.200
I mean, one minute they're
on a feeding frenzy,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.167
and the next they're
dropping from the sky.

05:33.267 --> 05:36.200
I suspect you've stepped into
a very controlled experiment.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.067
So what you're saying is
the best is yet to come?

05:38.167 --> 05:42.133
I pray you find out before we
have a disaster on our hands.

05:45.167 --> 05:47.667
 I got the autopsy results
 on our dead informant.

05:47.767 --> 05:52.000
Let me guess:
death by locusts.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.667
  Try bullets - two of them.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.167
Hm.

05:56.267 --> 05:59.067
Whoever's breeding these
things is willing to kill
to protect them.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.367
 The company he
 worked for is ZDT.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.701
  It's a huge agro conglomerate
run by the Keary family.

06:10.801 --> 06:12.634
 I understand you're
 familiar with them.

06:12.734 --> 06:13.634
Yeah.

06:13.734 --> 06:14.801
We're old family friends.

06:14.901 --> 06:15.901
We used to summer together.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.601
What? In between terms
 at boarding school?

06:18.701 --> 06:20.801
 You know... only rich
 people <i>"summer".</i>

06:20.901 --> 06:22.367
Yeah... You were making a point.

06:22.467 --> 06:25.067
I think you were trying to
suggest that the Kearys
were involved.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.701
 ZDT owns the fields
 destroyed by the bugs.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.934
 Which makes them either
 a target - or the source.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.734
  Now we don't have
 time to waste here.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.267
Jess, you're our in.

06:33.367 --> 06:34.734
What? Expect me just
to waltz in there

06:34.834 --> 06:37.934
and ask if somebody's invented
any new agro-plagues lately?

06:38.033 --> 06:40.934
 Actually, I was hoping for
 a more subtle approach.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.667
  Here.

06:42.767 --> 06:47.300
Dominion has set you up
with a rather generous
financial portfolio.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.667
 Don't get too excited
 - it's just play money.

06:49.767 --> 06:53.667
Ahh. Just enough play money to
set up a meet and greet with ZDT

06:53.767 --> 06:55.901
as a venture capitalist
ready to play ball.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.868
Yeah.

06:56.968 --> 06:58.734
Anyway, the place is
run by uh...

06:58.834 --> 07:03.033
  Alisha Keary?

07:03.133 --> 07:04.133
Oh...

07:04.234 --> 07:06.901
 You two close?

07:12.634 --> 07:15.367
 Is this going to be
 a problem for you?

07:16.634 --> 07:18.234
No.

07:18.334 --> 07:20.200
Not at all.

07:27.767 --> 07:31.968
 Why is it that Armani looks
  a little too good on you?

07:32.067 --> 07:35.200
It's actually a Boss.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.701
You know at one point, this
was going to be my life?

07:37.801 --> 07:41.667
Ivy League school, corporate
job, the whole nine yards.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.934
 And you gave all that up for...
  Mutant X?

07:45.033 --> 07:46.834
No.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.767
I gave it up for me.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.267
Mr. Kilmartin?

07:50.367 --> 07:51.467
Nate Gilmore.

07:51.567 --> 07:52.133
Good to meet you.

07:52.234 --> 07:53.234
  Yeah.

07:53.334 --> 07:56.300
This Lexa Pierce, my
in-house counsel.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.767
How do you do?

07:57.868 --> 08:00.934
So, Alisha tells me you're
looking to invest in
agro-technologies?

08:01.033 --> 08:02.300
 Considering it.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.467
I think you'll be
very impressed.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.868
This way.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.467
Tight security.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.767
We set the benchmark in
cutting edge agro-science.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.434
 GMOs, RMFs.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.400
  Can't afford any
  snooping competitors.

08:25.501 --> 08:26.601
You'll have to excuse Nate.

08:26.701 --> 08:29.234
His enthusiasm is
only second to my own.

08:31.801 --> 08:32.933
 Jess.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.601
Alisha.

08:35.701 --> 08:37.868
It's good to see you again.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.333
 <clears throat>

08:41.433 --> 08:42.667
Oh, um...

08:42.767 --> 08:43.833
Lexa Pierce.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.801
  Hi.

08:45.901 --> 08:46.767
  Hi.

08:46.868 --> 08:49.200
My twelve thirty just cancelled.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.601
 So, if you would like, I could
 go over the company's expected
 earnings with you.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.868
 Over lunch.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.934
Great.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.467
 Great.

08:57.567 --> 09:01.100
Nate, could you please show Miss
 Pierce the necessary documents?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.033
 Of course.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.667
 Thank you.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.767
Given the area
of crop devastation,

09:07.868 --> 09:10.834
we should be able to pinpoint
where the locusts were released.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.667
  How? It's like trying to find
  a needle in a haystack.

09:13.767 --> 09:16.100
Well, not necessarily.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.300
This is the field where
we found the dead locusts.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.868
And we can use satellite imaging
to track their point of origin.

09:22.968 --> 09:24.033
Okay.

09:24.133 --> 09:27.701
This is 10:15, about the
time the locusts died.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.934
We reverse the timeline...

09:30.033 --> 09:30.934
 Hm.

09:31.033 --> 09:32.868
  There's our haystack.

09:32.968 --> 09:35.501
Whaddya say we go
find that needle?

09:39.701 --> 09:42.934
 So when did you decide to
 return to the family business?

09:43.033 --> 09:45.601
I guess that's hard to say.

09:45.701 --> 09:49.801
I suppose some things are
just in the blood, huh?

09:49.901 --> 09:52.701
 Well, if you're really
 serious about ZDT,

09:52.801 --> 09:56.000
 we're involved in some really
 breakthrough technology.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.801
Hm.

09:57.901 --> 10:01.734
Is that why some of your
fields were recently
attacked by infestation?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.534
 Uh... well,
 that's news to me.

10:03.634 --> 10:06.901
I'm sure if that was
a problem I'd know about it,
don't you think?

10:07.000 --> 10:13.467
Well, my people tell me
some of your crops were
very seriously damaged.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.801
Your people?

10:14.901 --> 10:16.801
 So you been doing
 your research?

10:16.901 --> 10:18.834
 Yeah, well, whatever that was,

10:18.934 --> 10:22.667
 I'm sure it's nothing to be
 concerned about.

10:22.767 --> 10:26.667
ZDT is a high-profile
corporation.

10:26.767 --> 10:29.667
I'm sure you have your
share of corporate enemies.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.868
  Yeah, well, it comes with the
  territory, doesn't it, Jess?

10:32.968 --> 10:34.834
You know, there's always
someone out there ready

10:34.934 --> 10:37.467
  to cut your throat before you
  have a chance to cut theirs.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.701
Yeah.

10:41.968 --> 10:44.033
How long do we
have to do this?

10:44.133 --> 10:45.267
What?

10:45.367 --> 10:47.834
 Pretend that this isn't
 incredibly awkward

10:47.934 --> 10:50.100
 - seeing each other again?

10:53.767 --> 10:56.634
You don't know how many
times I wanted to call you.

10:56.734 --> 11:00.634
 So why didn't you?

11:00.734 --> 11:02.834
I just didn't
know what to say.

11:04.834 --> 11:09.067
Well, to be perfectly frank,
until now Alisha's been wary of
outside investors.

11:09.167 --> 11:13.601
  Ah, so you're doing just
  fine on your own, is that it?

11:13.701 --> 11:15.801
  You know, I would love
  to get a look at a report

11:15.901 --> 11:18.901
  on some of the farming
  technologies you have
  in development.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.300
Well, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.534
All R&D is confidential.

11:23.634 --> 11:29.067
 Nate, we both know how much
 Mr. Kilmartin is prepared
 to invest here.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.667
Throw me a bone.

11:30.767 --> 11:31.667
I'm sorry.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.000
Alisha wouldn't have
it any other way.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.734
 She seems surprisingly young
 to be the head of the company.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.367
She's a classic
Type A personality.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.868
Just <i>don't get in her way.</i>

11:41.968 --> 11:43.634
 Ooh, sounds like a
 loaded statement.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.501
<laughs> Well, just say she
knows what she wants,

11:45.601 --> 11:46.667
and she knows how to get it.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.267
  At all costs?

11:48.367 --> 11:50.267
We're in a competitive
field, Miss Pierce.

11:50.367 --> 11:53.234
Alisha knows how to
maintain the edge.

11:56.667 --> 12:00.868
Well, then, whenever you're
finished here, my secretary
will see you out.

12:00.968 --> 12:03.000
 Great.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.534
Guys, any luck on your end?

12:07.634 --> 12:09.467
  Alright, we think we found
  where the bugs were released.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.934
 It's a barn on a parcel of
 land

12:11.033 --> 12:13.901
  owned by a company called
  Pacific Bionetics.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.901
Maybe ZDT's been the
target all along.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.434
It's too soon to tell.

12:17.534 --> 12:20.501
Anyways, Jessie's feeling things
out with Alisha Keary right now.

12:20.601 --> 12:22.667
 <u> <i>Alisha?</u></i>

12:22.767 --> 12:25.334
There's a name I haven't
heard in a long time.

12:25.434 --> 12:26.300
What do you mean?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.367
 She was a part of his old life.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.000
His first real love.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.467
Oh. How real?

12:31.567 --> 12:32.901
 <i>High school sweethearts.</i>

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I think at one point
they were even engaged.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.567
Really?

12:37.667 --> 12:40.200
Well, it's nice of
him to have told me.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.601
I guess it just
slipped his mind.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.067
 Aw, relax, Lex.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.234
  It was ten years ago.

12:44.334 --> 12:45.801
I'm sure she's ancient history.

12:45.901 --> 12:48.300
Well, you know what? I hope so.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.601
So how involved are you in
the day-to-day operations?

12:53.701 --> 12:55.667
 I'm a control freak
 - you know that.

12:55.767 --> 12:58.834
 Like to micromanage everything.

13:00.367 --> 13:01.567
 Used to bug you, didn't it?

13:01.667 --> 13:05.267
Nah, not... maybe just...
a little, yeah.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.000
<laughing> <cell phone rings>
Sorry.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.033
 Hello?

13:15.133 --> 13:17.801
No. You know what?
If you're not going to handle
that, then I will.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.801
  Yeah.
  Okay.
 Thanks.

13:22.901 --> 13:24.200
  Sorry about that.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.167
Everything okay?

13:25.267 --> 13:27.000
 Yeah. Yeah.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.601
 It will be.

13:28.701 --> 13:30.200
All right, what's wrong
with this picture?

13:30.300 --> 13:33.267
If this is where the swarm
started, then why didn't
they eat this corn?

13:33.367 --> 13:34.734
Maybe they read the signs.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.167
<laughing>

13:36.267 --> 13:39.300
  I mean, what is this corn
  made out of anyway? Gold?

13:40.033 --> 13:41.734
I don't know.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.801
I guess I should grab a sample
for Dr. Bellows

13:49.300 --> 13:51.200
 We got company.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.601
 Oh...!

14:21.200 --> 14:22.701
Come on, let's
get out of here.

14:22.801 --> 14:24.534
 I thought you'd never ask.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.434
Look, Leesh...

14:31.534 --> 14:34.968
I know you're really swamped
right now, but I'd really like
to see you again.

14:39.934 --> 14:42.801
  Tell me you're not going to
  try to stir things up, right?

14:49.334 --> 14:50.868
I'm not...

14:50.968 --> 14:53.968
here to stir things up.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.567
Can we meet for drinks later?
<cell phone rings>

14:56.667 --> 14:59.501
 Sorry.

14:59.601 --> 15:00.300
 Yeah...

15:00.400 --> 15:02.334
 I don't know. Um...

15:04.801 --> 15:07.767
 I have to work late.

15:07.868 --> 15:10.133
Hello?

15:11.133 --> 15:12.968
Ohh.

15:13.067 --> 15:15.300
  There is nothing that
  touches me more...

15:15.400 --> 15:18.667
 than the look of two corporate
 executives in love.

15:18.767 --> 15:25.033
Has anybody ever told you it is
really not <i>polite to eavesdrop?</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:26.334
  All the time.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.000
Hm...

15:28.100 --> 15:33.767
So tell me: when were you
planning on telling me you
two used to be engaged?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.167
It's not an issue.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.200
I grilled her at lunch.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.334
She's not involved.

15:40.434 --> 15:45.534
Well, then, let's just hope
you're better at picking out
liars than she is.

15:57.767 --> 16:01.434
Hey.
Hi.
Okay...

16:01.534 --> 16:05.300
 I've just figured out what
 kills these insects, all right?

16:05.400 --> 16:08.133
  They were designed with a
  self-destruct mechanism.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.701
They rupture from the inside?

16:09.801 --> 16:11.067
 It's ingenious, really.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.133
And when I determine what
the trigger is

16:12.234 --> 16:14.567
we'll be able
to destroy these things.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.467
So what about the corn?
Why didn't they touch it?

16:16.567 --> 16:18.133
  Ah, ha ha ha!

16:18.234 --> 16:20.534
 Because these have been
 genetically modified

16:20.634 --> 16:23.567
 to be the one crop that is
 resistant to these insects.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.467
So we're not dealing
with an agro-terrorist,

16:25.567 --> 16:27.434
this is just a simple
case of supply and demand.

16:27.534 --> 16:28.534
Wake up, people.

16:28.634 --> 16:30.000
Welcome to the world
of Franken-foods.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.868
 You know, there's no
 telling what repercussions

16:31.968 --> 16:33.968
these hybrid crops could
have on the environment.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.200
Well, someone's planning
on profiting from this.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.601
Looks like that corn is
made of gold after all.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.634
 Hate to break it to you, Jess.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.567
 But your ex-fiancee's involved.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.434
  Pacific Bionetics
  is owned by ZDT.

16:46.534 --> 16:47.601
What?

16:47.701 --> 16:49.067
 I had to trace through
 dummy corporations

16:49.167 --> 16:51.567
 and overseas trust funds
 to find the link to Alisha.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.834
That can't be.

16:52.934 --> 16:54.133
  I don't know, Jess.

16:54.234 --> 16:56.167
You got to admit, it does
look kind of suspicious.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.033
 Look, I have known this
 woman for half my life.

16:58.133 --> 16:59.133
  Trust me.

16:59.234 --> 17:00.667
  She's not a part of this.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.834
 Are you sure that's
 not your heart talking?

17:02.934 --> 17:05.166
Or...
some other part?

17:05.267 --> 17:07.434
 It's not like that.

17:07.534 --> 17:11.099
Well, we're going to have to go
back to ZDT to find the answers
in the back of the book.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
How?

17:12.300 --> 17:13.733
Well...

17:13.834 --> 17:17.534
I'm sure Alisha's
still working.

17:17.634 --> 17:20.434
 That means all you gotta do
 is go over there and...

17:20.534 --> 17:22.800
 keep her company
 while Lexa looks around.

17:22.901 --> 17:25.099
 And how exactly am I
 supposed to do that?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.267
Oh.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.033
I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

17:36.801 --> 17:39.767
 Jess, I just want you to know,
 this isn't anything personal.

17:43.601 --> 17:45.000
 Doesn't matter.

17:45.100 --> 17:45.868
The only reason I am doing this

17:45.968 --> 17:48.100
is to prove that you are wrong.

17:49.133 --> 17:50.901
Look, I know you can't see it,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.934
but I can tell this Alisha she
eats guys like you for lunch.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.234
 Really?

17:55.334 --> 17:57.734
The problem is you're
too trusting, Jess.

18:01.701 --> 18:04.000
 I've trusted you
  since the day we met.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.033
That isn't exactly
helping your argument.

18:13.234 --> 18:14.968
Jess, what are
you doing here?

18:15.067 --> 18:17.501
  Ha...

18:17.601 --> 18:18.901
Well, thanks for meeting me.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.534
It's a little late, don't you
think, for a business meeting?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.901
 You know that's
 not why I'm here.

18:24.801 --> 18:26.801
My office.

18:26.901 --> 18:30.200
Do you still like,
uh, gin and tonic?

18:30.300 --> 18:30.968
  Yeah.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.000
 Yeah?

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
Can't remember the
last time I had one.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.834
 Yeah?

18:36.934 --> 18:38.267
 I can.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.667
Uh, it was at Spadini's.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.400
We were talking
about wedding plans.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.234
  Remember?

18:44.334 --> 18:45.200
Yeah.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.567
Well, your mind
wasn't really there.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.067
Well, I figured you just
had a case of cold feet.

19:01.334 --> 19:06.934
  But I guess I had no idea how
  cold your feet were, did I?

19:07.033 --> 19:08.501
 You know,

19:08.601 --> 19:10.868
 I made a promise to myself
 that the next time I saw you

19:10.968 --> 19:15.200
 I would tell you exactly
 what I thought about you.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.200
Probably the least I deserve.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.200
  Yeah.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.667
 Funny thing is, though, I'm...

19:19.767 --> 19:22.100
  I'm looking at you right now,
and I don't know -

19:22.200 --> 19:24.467
  I don't feel like
 saying it any more.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.467
 <i>Are you in yet?</i>

19:29.567 --> 19:32.534
Yeah, but unfortunately,
 I haven't found very much.

19:32.634 --> 19:36.133
 I'm trying to see what
 I can dig up in their
interoffice VOIP system.

19:36.234 --> 19:37.834
VOIP?

19:37.934 --> 19:41.734
Yeah, it's a computerized log
of all in- and out-going
telecommunications.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.267
  These guys are anal about
 corporate espionage leaks.

19:44.367 --> 19:48.801
 See, all calls are recorded
 - especially R&D guys.

19:48.901 --> 19:51.467
  So...

19:51.567 --> 19:53.968
  What was it? Did I...

19:54.067 --> 19:55.801
  did I do something? Or...

19:55.901 --> 19:57.267
Alisha, I was messed up.

19:57.367 --> 20:02.467
<laughs>

20:02.567 --> 20:05.400
I had things going on that...

20:05.501 --> 20:07.167
that you couldn't understand.

20:07.267 --> 20:09.400
 So you felt like you
 couldn't turn to me, then?

20:09.501 --> 20:11.801
No. It wasn't that simple.

20:11.901 --> 20:13.234
 <sighs>

20:13.334 --> 20:15.000
I didn't feel
that it was fair...

20:15.100 --> 20:16.033
 Hm.

20:16.133 --> 20:21.634
...for me to start a
life with you...

20:21.734 --> 20:24.033
...where I didn't fit.

20:26.467 --> 20:30.234
  Shouldn't I have been
  able to choose that?

20:33.133 --> 20:34.834
I'm into operation level.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.100
Searching through
Michael Porter's account.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.334
Who is that?

20:38.434 --> 20:41.367
  <i>The informant found
  <i>dead in the cornfield.</i></i>

20:41.467 --> 20:44.534
Okay. Punching into his
final call in his log.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.801
 <laughing>

21:07.100 --> 21:07.968
Alisha.

21:08.067 --> 21:08.934
 Shh...

21:09.033 --> 21:09.801
I don't want to hurt you again.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.901
 Shhh...

21:12.000 --> 21:15.133
  No, I'm not going to let you.

21:15.234 --> 21:18.000
 INFORMANT'S VOICE
   <i>"Look, I am tired of getting
   <i>jerked around here.</i></i>

21:18.100 --> 21:19.968
 <i>I know all about
   <i>Project Redstock.</i></i>

21:20.067 --> 21:24.100
 <i>And if you don't come
 <i>through by 8 P.M. tonight
 <i>I am taking this wide."</i></i></i>

21:24.200 --> 21:25.501
Well, that sounds
like a threat.

21:25.601 --> 21:27.601
  And a motive.

21:27.701 --> 21:29.567
 Who was he calling?

21:31.033 --> 21:33.734
 Alisha Keary.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.567
 Looks like she was willing to
 kill for the bottom line.

21:38.534 --> 21:41.767
  I'll say this for Jess, he
  sure knows how to pick 'em.

21:58.868 --> 22:00.734
<laughing>

22:00.834 --> 22:03.334
Phew!

22:05.968 --> 22:13.701
  <laughing>

22:13.801 --> 22:14.334
 Hi.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.534
Hi.

22:17.634 --> 22:20.067
 Reminds me of the time
  that my father caught us.

22:20.167 --> 22:21.167
 You remember that?

22:21.267 --> 22:22.534
 We were in the pool cabana

22:22.634 --> 22:25.501
 and there was that
 fireworks display.

22:25.601 --> 22:26.501
Yeah.

22:26.601 --> 22:28.801
<laughs>

22:28.901 --> 22:31.801
He never seemed to look
at me the same way after that.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.133
 Neither did I.

22:33.234 --> 22:33.901
Really?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.033
 Yeah.

22:40.033 --> 22:42.567
You know
I've changed,
Alisha.

22:42.667 --> 22:45.100
 Everybody changes.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.100
That's okay.

22:50.567 --> 22:53.267
 Look, relax, Jess.
  You know, it's...

22:53.367 --> 22:56.667
 I have zero
 expectations here - really.

22:56.767 --> 22:59.200
 You know, whatever
 that was, it's just...

22:59.300 --> 23:02.133
 it's just what it was,
  you know?

23:02.234 --> 23:04.634
That's not what I mean.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.834
 What do you mean, then?

23:07.667 --> 23:10.567
I just...

23:10.667 --> 23:12.734
I keep running a
series of "what ifs".

23:12.834 --> 23:14.200
I mean...

23:14.300 --> 23:15.567
I mean, what if I
hadn't run away?

23:15.667 --> 23:18.367
What if...
what if...

23:18.467 --> 23:23.167
What if I'd been straight up
with you from the beginning?

23:23.267 --> 23:27.133
What if we can just start again?
How about that?

23:27.234 --> 23:30.667
What if we can just
start again, huh?

23:30.767 --> 23:32.501
 What do you think of that?

23:32.601 --> 23:35.601
 Hey, I cross-referenced
Project Redstock,
but I'm coming up empty.

23:35.701 --> 23:37.801
ZDT's planning a
 worldwide devastation.

23:37.901 --> 23:40.367
 I can't imagine those bugs
 were that easy to hide.

23:40.467 --> 23:41.767
  Alisha's not stupid, Shal.

23:41.868 --> 23:44.234
I'm sure she figured out
  a way to cover her tracks.

23:50.033 --> 23:50.801
All right, Doc.

23:50.901 --> 23:51.767
 Uh huh?

23:51.868 --> 23:53.434
Look, I could really
use your help.

23:53.534 --> 23:55.601
Can you pull a rabbit out
of your hat right about now?

23:55.701 --> 23:58.100
  Okay.
 How about this?

23:58.200 --> 24:03.501
I found residue of nitrogen-rich
protein in the system of the
  specimen you brought.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.200
 Okay, okay.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.267
 It's like this.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.734
 Locusts begin as eggs,

24:10.834 --> 24:14.067
 which eventually hatch,
 and become wingless nymphs.

24:14.167 --> 24:18.868
A nitrogen-rich diet
 speeds along their growth.

24:18.968 --> 24:20.834
  Okay.

24:20.934 --> 24:22.033
 I'm losing you.

24:22.133 --> 24:23.367
 All right.
  Okay.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.901
 Right now, they're
 feeding on a...

24:26.000 --> 24:30.534
a dry spore mix which is
commonly sold as Fer-lomant.

24:30.634 --> 24:35.234
And by the projected size of the
  swarm they're going to need a
 lot of it.

24:35.334 --> 24:36.601
Did you get that, Lex?

24:36.701 --> 24:38.801
 Fer-lomant, I'm on it.

24:38.901 --> 24:40.367
 Okay.

24:40.467 --> 24:43.234
 I'm looking at purchase orders
 for almost a ton of this stuff.

24:43.334 --> 24:46.634
  Delivered to a farm outside
 the town of Decatur.

24:46.734 --> 24:49.767
Gotta be our source.

24:49.868 --> 24:52.734
 You never did tell me where
you've been for all these years.

24:52.834 --> 24:54.334
 <i>Hey, lover-boy.</i>

24:55.734 --> 24:58.167
Hello?
Is this thing on?

24:58.267 --> 24:59.300
<coughs>

24:59.400 --> 25:00.868
Cat got your tongue?

25:00.968 --> 25:02.000
  Are you okay?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.267
I hope that's all she's got.

25:03.367 --> 25:04.767
  Yeah, I just gotta...
 get another drink.

25:04.868 --> 25:05.634
  Okay.

25:05.734 --> 25:07.167
   <i>Jess,</i>

25:07.267 --> 25:08.968
   <i>Alisha's been behind this
   <i>from the very start.</i></i>

25:09.067 --> 25:12.033
   <i>She's the one who ordered
  <i>the killing on the informant.</i></i>

25:12.133 --> 25:13.234
It's time to smarten up.

25:13.334 --> 25:14.634
 It's called Project Redstock.

25:14.734 --> 25:16.267
  And hopefully it's not too
 late to shut them down,

25:16.367 --> 25:18.701
  but you need to get out of
  there now, you understand?

25:18.801 --> 25:20.801
<coughs> Okay.

25:24.167 --> 25:27.534
Listen, I... I...
uh, I gotta go. Excuse me.

25:27.634 --> 25:28.534
Gotta go?

25:28.634 --> 25:29.701
 Why do you have to go?

25:29.801 --> 25:31.100
 Why do you have to go?
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
  Wait.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.534
I don't want any
 secrets here, okay?

25:33.634 --> 25:37.367
 So just talk to me.

25:37.467 --> 25:39.601
I know about Project Redstock.

25:39.701 --> 25:43.968
 Is this, like, a joke?
 Because I have <u>no</u> idea
 what you're talking about.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.834
You gotta be straight with me.

25:45.934 --> 25:46.634
Okay?

25:46.734 --> 25:48.000
You are way over your head.

25:48.100 --> 25:50.834
And the only way I can help you
is if you tell me the truth.

25:50.934 --> 25:52.033
 The truth?

25:52.133 --> 25:54.834
 Okay, who's the liar here?

25:54.934 --> 25:58.000
 What did you come back for?

25:58.100 --> 25:59.601
I had to investigate.

25:59.701 --> 26:02.901
 You had to investigate?
 Oh, I see.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.767
 So, you really didn't come
 back here to invest in...
 in ZDT, right?

26:06.868 --> 26:09.501
And you obviously didn't
  come back here to get me.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.434
I had no idea
I'd feel this way.

26:15.133 --> 26:16.000
Get out.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.000
Alisha, please...

26:17.100 --> 26:18.133
 I said get out.

26:18.234 --> 26:23.234
 I never want to see
 you again. Get out.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.834
  Nate, yeah. I need
  to see you in here.

26:35.934 --> 26:38.033
 Yeah, 'cause we have a problem.

26:48.033 --> 26:50.234
 Now if these bugs are here, how
are we supposed to destroy them?

26:50.334 --> 26:52.501
Well, Dr. Bellows is going to
contact us when she figures out

26:52.601 --> 26:57.234
 how to activate
the self-destruct system.

26:57.334 --> 26:59.033
 Hopefully they're still
 contained in the barn.

26:59.133 --> 27:01.334
Worst comes to worst, we
can always burn it down.

27:01.434 --> 27:03.667
  Huh, nice.

27:03.767 --> 27:07.000
  Just turn them grasshoppers
 into fireflies.

27:12.133 --> 27:13.734
Where have you been?

27:17.067 --> 27:19.567
  You took your sweet time.

27:19.667 --> 27:20.767
I'm sorry.

27:20.868 --> 27:23.667
  I just had to clear
  my head a little.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.734
Any word from Shalimar
and Brennan?

27:25.834 --> 27:27.567
Not yet.

27:32.033 --> 27:33.901
I'm sorry, Jess.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.467
 If it means anything, I was
  hoping I was wrong about her.

27:37.567 --> 27:39.367
Whatcha gonna do?

27:40.834 --> 27:42.133
 <i>Okay, guys, we're here.</i>

27:42.234 --> 27:43.534
You see anything?

27:43.634 --> 27:46.133
Looks like someone took off
from here in a hurry.

27:47.267 --> 27:49.000
  Let's take a look inside.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.701
The place is cleared.

27:55.801 --> 27:59.033
Too late. Damn.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.167
Well, they're grown.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.300
  Looks like they were in the
  process of releasing them.

28:18.501 --> 28:20.968
 Brennan, it's a bomb!

28:34.267 --> 28:37.701
This was no coincidence.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.133
 We were set up.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.267
  Somebody must have
tipped them off.

28:51.334 --> 28:52.667
You told her, didn't you?

28:52.767 --> 28:56.000
 I had to level with her, Lexa.
 There was too much at stake.

28:56.100 --> 29:00.701
 Yeah, that's exactly why you
 should've kept your mouth shut.

29:00.801 --> 29:03.634
What did you think?
Her love for you would suddenly
spur a burst of honesty?

29:03.734 --> 29:04.501
Well, I gave it a shot.

29:04.601 --> 29:05.734
  Well, you were wrong.

29:05.834 --> 29:06.834
Yeah, I got that.

29:06.934 --> 29:07.868
 Well, that's great.

29:07.968 --> 29:09.067
Now thanks to you we have

29:09.167 --> 29:10.734
no idea where those bugs
are going to be released.

29:10.834 --> 29:13.033
  Good.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.901
Now it's anybody's game.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.934
 No telling how many
truckloads of those bugs
 might've made it out.

29:23.033 --> 29:25.501
 Yeah, or where they're headed.

29:25.601 --> 29:28.067
 Well, maybe your little
  friend can tell us.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.000
 Yeah.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.968
 I think I'll name him Chester.

29:33.767 --> 29:35.534
 Stay.

29:36.300 --> 29:53.501
<computer beeps>

29:53.601 --> 29:54.501
 Alisha.

29:54.601 --> 29:55.767
  <i>Listen, don't hang up, okay?</i>

29:55.868 --> 29:57.400
  <i>Everything that
  <i>you said was right.</i></i>

29:57.501 --> 30:00.767
 Look, I've been poring
  over these R&D files and...

30:00.868 --> 30:01.968
  I can't believe it.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.501
 You can't believe what?

30:03.601 --> 30:05.133
 <i>Everything that
   <i>you said was true.</i></i>

30:05.234 --> 30:08.000
   <i>Pacific Bionetics,
   <i>the crop research.</i></i>

30:08.100 --> 30:11.667
 Someone's been funnelling money
  from ZDT to fund all this.

30:11.767 --> 30:12.968
 Why are you telling me this?

30:13.067 --> 30:14.767
   <i>Because my name is
  <i>all over everything.</i></i>

30:14.868 --> 30:18.734
There's money trails, there's...
  there's requisition forms.

30:21.267 --> 30:23.133
Listen, I... I need you.

30:23.234 --> 30:26.467
I need you to come here,
  and I need you to help me.

30:26.567 --> 30:27.801
 Alisha, the last time
I trusted you,

30:27.901 --> 30:29.767
  two of my friends
  almost got killed.

30:29.868 --> 30:33.534
 Jess, I had no idea.

30:33.634 --> 30:37.300
  Okay? You just have
 to believe me.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.834
Okay, look, stay in your
 office. I'll be right there.

30:39.934 --> 30:42.334
 Okay.

30:47.234 --> 30:49.667
Nate, why didn't you tell me
about Project Redstock?

30:49.767 --> 30:51.801
Because I was trying
 to protect you.

30:51.901 --> 30:53.267
 It's why I've been covering
  your back from the start,

30:53.367 --> 30:56.267
  destroying memos,
  deleting voice mails.

30:56.367 --> 30:59.000
  Do you have any idea the size
  of the players involved here?

30:59.100 --> 31:01.200
 The amount of money
  we stand to make?

31:01.300 --> 31:02.300
  Billions.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.434
By creating a plague?

31:03.534 --> 31:04.901
 No, it would never
 get to that level.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.534
  Look, a few farms
 will be destroyed.

31:06.634 --> 31:08.434
 The press would
  have a field day,

31:08.534 --> 31:09.934
 then ZDT come out as heroes

31:10.033 --> 31:13.701
  when we release the first
 insect-resistant corn.

31:13.801 --> 31:15.400
 Nobody gets hurt here, Alisha.

31:15.501 --> 31:19.000
 It's a win-win all around.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.801
 Look, we can't give up now.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.200
Where you going?

31:30.300 --> 31:31.601
Alisha called.
She needs my help.

31:31.701 --> 31:33.868
 Of course she does.

31:36.067 --> 31:38.000
Look...

31:40.834 --> 31:43.133
I'm not going to say
that I believe her.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.334
But if she is
telling the truth,

31:44.434 --> 31:45.601
then she is our only lead

31:45.701 --> 31:46.868
as to where these locusts
are going to be released.

31:46.968 --> 31:48.167
And if she isn't,

31:48.267 --> 31:50.033
you're just giving her another
chance to play you again.

31:50.133 --> 31:53.667
I'll take that chance.

31:53.767 --> 31:56.067
  Then I'm coming with you.

32:03.534 --> 32:04.701
 Stay here.

32:04.801 --> 32:07.501
Yeah, right.

32:07.601 --> 32:11.400
 Lexa, just give me
 two minutes with her.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.601
Two minutes.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.400
  No!

33:03.901 --> 33:06.834
  <screaming>

33:08.367 --> 33:11.167
  Oh, my God!

33:11.267 --> 33:12.300
  Oh, my God.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.901
 Oh...

33:20.067 --> 33:21.300
How did you do that?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.801
Look, there's some things in
this world you can understand.

33:24.901 --> 33:26.167
And there's some
things that you can't.

33:26.267 --> 33:27.133
Oh, God.

33:27.234 --> 33:28.968
  And you fall into the latter?

33:29.067 --> 33:30.634
Yeah.

33:30.734 --> 33:31.868
 Oh, my God.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.400
It's okay. Look, it's
going to be okay. Trust me.

33:35.501 --> 33:38.634
I'm getting you out of here.

33:38.734 --> 33:39.767
Okay?

33:39.868 --> 33:40.701
Oh, God.

33:40.801 --> 33:41.634
Okay.

33:41.734 --> 33:43.334
It's all right.

33:45.267 --> 33:46.601
  Tell us you have good news.

33:46.701 --> 33:50.968
 <i>I have discovered the key
 <i>on how to kill the locusts.</i></i>

33:51.067 --> 33:52.267
 <i>Sound waves.</i>

33:52.367 --> 33:55.734
 <i>The right frequency
 <i>shatters the destruct organ.</i></i>

33:55.834 --> 33:57.601
 <i>Killing them instantly.</i>

33:57.701 --> 34:01.868
Well, I can upload it to the
Helix, so we can pump it out
through the external speakers.

34:01.968 --> 34:04.801
 Yeah, but the Helix's sonic
 range is only a hundred metres.

34:04.901 --> 34:06.300
 <i>Oh, would you stop complaining?</i>

34:06.400 --> 34:08.333
  <i>That gives you two minutes to
  <i>neutralize these things</i></i>

34:08.434 --> 34:10.033
  <i>after they've been released.</i>

34:10.132 --> 34:10.967
If we can find 'em.

34:11.067 --> 34:12.333
   <i>Well, you better.</i>

34:12.434 --> 34:14.132
  <i>These things reproduce
  <i>at an alarming rate.</i></i>

34:14.234 --> 34:16.967
 <i>And once they spread, they will
  <i>devour anything in their path.</i></i>

34:17.067 --> 34:19.132
 Any chance we might be able to
 narrow down the field for us?

34:19.234 --> 34:21.667
 <i>I would have to say that you're
  <i>going to have to go low-tech.</i></i>

34:21.766 --> 34:24.333
What do you mean? Swoop over the
corn fields like a crop duster?

34:24.434 --> 34:27.567
  <i>Well, unless you've
  <i>got a better idea...</i></i>

34:36.766 --> 34:38.033
  I'm right behind you guys.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.000
  What the hell's going on?
  Is Alisha okay?

34:40.100 --> 34:41.868
You can say she's
  a little confused.

34:41.967 --> 34:44.167
Well, see if she knows
where the locusts are
going to be released.

34:44.266 --> 34:45.400
 Who are you talking to?

34:45.501 --> 34:47.934
I'm talking to a friend.
She's just trying to help.

34:48.033 --> 34:52.934
Now, do you have any idea
where Nate might be trying to
release the locusts?

34:53.033 --> 34:53.634
 I don't know...

34:53.734 --> 34:54.467
Come on, think.

34:54.567 --> 34:55.534
Think!

34:55.634 --> 34:57.067
I don't know!
I just found out about this.

34:57.167 --> 34:59.400
You have to believe me.
I just found out about this.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.934
  It's impossible to
 cover this much area.

35:04.033 --> 35:06.801
 These corn fields go on
 for hundreds of miles.

35:06.901 --> 35:08.667
Yeah, well, if we don't find
these locusts in time,

35:08.767 --> 35:12.234
Chester's little buddies are
going to cut through those
fields like a machete.

35:19.968 --> 35:21.400
 Okay, kids. They just pulled
onto the freeway.

35:21.501 --> 35:23.200
 You're heading
  north on the I-80.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.868
We just got onto a freeway.

35:24.968 --> 35:25.968
 A freeway?

35:26.067 --> 35:27.501
 What direction are we going in?

35:27.601 --> 35:29.901
We're heading north.
North on the I-80.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.133
North on the I-80...

35:31.234 --> 35:32.434
 You know what?

35:32.534 --> 35:34.601
I remember seeing paperwork.
  We leased a farm.

35:34.701 --> 35:35.467
Where?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.000
  South... south of Gilroy.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.300
  You got that, guys?

35:38.400 --> 35:42.234
  We are about forty
 miles north of there.

35:42.334 --> 35:44.868
According to this, there's only
two farms outside the town.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.534
  Looks like we got a
  fifty-fifty chance.

35:47.634 --> 35:49.167
 Tell you what.

35:49.267 --> 35:51.834
 Why don't we just stop
at the one where we hear
 the locusts buzzing?

36:12.501 --> 36:15.067
 Release them, then get
those trucks out of here.

37:01.968 --> 37:03.033
Oh, my God.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.367
 It's okay.

37:04.467 --> 37:04.968
I'm scared.

37:05.067 --> 37:06.167
  It's okay.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.200
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.501
 Do it.

37:09.601 --> 37:11.467
  And bury her in the field.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.601
 <i>Got it.</i>

37:13.701 --> 37:14.934
 Okay go over there.
 Stay behind me.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.000
No. No no no...

37:16.100 --> 37:17.868
Yes, get over there.

37:20.701 --> 37:22.434
Agghh...!

37:33.534 --> 37:34.734
Come on!

37:45.534 --> 37:47.167
 Good. Come on.

37:58.934 --> 38:01.300
Isn't it a little
too early for sunset?

38:04.300 --> 38:08.501
 Aw! Come on. Go. Go go go!

38:12.167 --> 38:15.100
 Okay, I've got the wave
  pattern locked and loaded.
  We're ready to go.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.634
 We gonna need earplugs
 for this thing?

38:16.734 --> 38:19.033
 Relax. The frequency is well
  out of your hearing range.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.200
But I'm probably going to
 end up with a migraine.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.167
Aw, then I'll have to get
you a couple of aspirin.

38:26.667 --> 38:27.367
 Oh..!

38:27.467 --> 38:29.400
  You okay? Come on.

38:32.701 --> 38:35.634
You may be bullet-proof,
but she isn't.

38:35.734 --> 38:36.901
Don't move!

38:37.000 --> 38:38.734
What, like this?

38:38.834 --> 38:41.601
 Agh...!

38:43.067 --> 38:44.567
 Hey, Bren, Shalimar,
what's going on?

38:44.667 --> 38:46.467
Somebody call for
an exterminator?

38:46.567 --> 38:49.734
 Now, Bren. Forty more seconds,
 the bugs'll be out of range.

38:49.834 --> 38:51.767
See ya, Chester.

39:01.467 --> 39:04.501
 Ugh...

39:04.601 --> 39:07.834
 oh...

39:11.100 --> 39:12.901
  It worked.

39:13.033 --> 39:15.200
Yeah, no kidding.

39:26.968 --> 39:28.868
 Well, the good news is
 the bugs are destroyed.

39:28.968 --> 39:32.133
 The bad news is the windshield
 of the Helix is a mess.

39:32.234 --> 39:34.334
Yeah, and I'm not cleaning it.

39:34.434 --> 39:38.467
 Well, guys, apparently
 the Dominion destroyed
 all of ZDT's research.

39:38.567 --> 39:41.868
Well, I guess that leaves Alisha
 to rebuild the company from the
  ground up.

39:41.968 --> 39:44.868
You know, something tells
 me she won't have a problem.

39:51.367 --> 39:53.767
Were you always like this?

39:53.868 --> 39:57.300
 It started in high school.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.100
So all the time that
we were together you...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.033
you were just hiding it from me?

40:07.033 --> 40:08.734
 You know, you could've
 told me that.

40:08.834 --> 40:10.734
I would've accepted it, right?

40:10.834 --> 40:14.033
 Yeah, but at the time I
  couldn't accept it in myself.

40:19.601 --> 40:21.033
So this, uh...

40:21.133 --> 40:22.968
this...

40:23.067 --> 40:27.634
new life that you have...

40:27.734 --> 40:29.534
makes you happy?

40:29.634 --> 40:31.033
  Yeah.

40:31.133 --> 40:32.400
 Yeah, it does.

40:32.501 --> 40:35.167
But there's no room for...

40:35.267 --> 40:38.968
you know, a wife, or...

40:39.067 --> 40:40.801
a white picket fence...?

40:40.901 --> 40:42.801
 I wish it was that simple.

40:44.534 --> 40:48.901
 But as much as I would like
to, I can't change who I am.

40:52.067 --> 40:56.868
Why does it seem like all the
good men are either gay or
married...

40:56.968 --> 40:58.534
or Mutants?

40:58.634 --> 41:00.434
<laughs>

41:06.534 --> 41:09.501
So I take it there
are others like you?

41:09.601 --> 41:10.601
Like her?

41:10.701 --> 41:12.334
  Yeah.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.834
Well, next time a woman comes
along that fits into your life,
promise me something.

41:19.934 --> 41:22.801
 Uh huh.

41:22.901 --> 41:26.133
Don't let her go.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.801
 Bye.

41:49.567 --> 41:51.534
Hey.

41:55.133 --> 41:59.701
Listen, it happens
to the best of us.

41:59.801 --> 42:04.234
But you'll be fine.

42:04.334 --> 42:08.300
 Yeah, whatever.
