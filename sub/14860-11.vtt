00:00.959 --> 00:03.200
Guys,

00:03.504 --> 00:05.290
My set list from when I
did stand-up in fifth grade.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.205
(INHALES DEEPLY)

00:07.508 --> 00:10.876
(IMITATING JERRY SEINFELD) What is
the deal with these moms who make lunch?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.760
Have you seen this? Have
you heard about this, Kelvin?

00:13.055 --> 00:15.422

00:15.724 --> 00:18.637

You told me this morning!

00:18.936 --> 00:21.928
And what is the deal

00:22.231 --> 00:24.438
| mean, how hard
does it have to be

00:24.733 --> 00:26.440
to get the facacta thing
in the hole?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.692
(LAUGHS) It just spills
all over ya! (LAUGHTER)

00:28.987 --> 00:30.443
(NORMAL VOICE) And then I
have a bunch of stuff about, like,

00:30.739 --> 00:32.729
the difference between
little girls and little boys.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.364
You know,
little girls be sharin'.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.900
(LAUGHS) They be sharin',
man. Little girls be sharin'.

00:36.203 --> 00:36.943
It's funny
"cause it's a list.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.907
(LAUGHS)

00:39.206 --> 00:40.913
Oh, boo. You're not laughing.
What's wrong?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.790
You consto?

00:43.085 --> 00:46.498
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just
bummed about work junk.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.413
The car czar and his cronies are

Whoa.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.586
Look at the sunny-side ups

00:51.885 --> 00:52.795
Mm-hmm.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.765
Ah, yeah, to think that

01:03.146 --> 01:04.557
She was once a baby...
(CHUCKLES)

Yeah.
Hey, guys.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.209
Hey!
Whazzup!

01:39.766 --> 01:42.633
and I have to wear this
stupid helmet for a month.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.677
You look like a crayon
a fat kid would eat.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.766
Did you valet your kayak or
did you find street parking?

Okay? Ah!

02:00.078 --> 02:01.910
Yeah, I don't remember
any of that.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.787

All right,

02:31.234 --> 02:32.770
enough with the
showboating, ya tiny hooligan.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.811
It's bad enough we're
getting beat by someone

02:35.113 --> 02:37.229
who's only slightly larger
than the actual foosball players.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.818

This guy is
a world-class dum-dum.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.415
| think you guys are
being pretty hard on Brody.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.083
He seems like
a funny, nice guy,

02:58.387 --> 02:59.718

word "bro" built right into it.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.155
Not your crap!
The fist bump!

03:27.457 --> 03:29.164
What?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.791
A fist bump is a sacred
contract between the fists of men.

03:32.087 --> 03:32.952
You don't go
playing around,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.166

into turkeys.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.298
| don't like that guy,
and I want it on record.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.334
We've been over this.
There is no actual record.

any of this?

to follow me into the boys club.

your tirade about the BCS.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.637

a legitimate playoff system!

some... Animal in it?

fans around here, huh?

04:12.461 --> 04:13.792
Man, do I approve
of the BCS!

04:14.087 --> 04:17.454
No! We need a legitimate
playoff system! Huh!

04:17.757 --> 04:19.543
I'm not a fan
of college, uh, football.

get this?

04:29.186 --> 04:32.224
Well, actually, | made it in my
candle studio/ our laundry room.

Yeah. Would you
show me how you do it?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.108
Uh-oh!
You did it now, Brad.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.235
You found her hobby...
(LAUGHS)

04:40.530 --> 04:42.737
Making bad versions of things that
you could just easily buy in a store.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.819
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:45.118 --> 04:46.904
But, by all means, show
her how you make that thing.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.990
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Show me how you make it.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.495

Don't leave me.
Don't leave me. Unh!

04:54.878 --> 04:56.710
(CHUCKLES)

04:57.005 --> 04:58.461

04:58.757 --> 05:00.213
You and the guys wanna
go check out some porno?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.667
Get some eyes
on some thighs?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.552
Some peepers
on some creepers?

(ENUNCIATES)
Bras and thongs?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.266
No.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.646
This helmet thing
isn't that bad.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.558

need to cute it up, right?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.225
Here. Take that off. Try
this one. (VELCRO RIPS)

05:21.446 --> 05:23.028
Eh? Come on,
it's pink.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.358
Al right.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.864
This is so stupid.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.069
ALEX: What?
| think it's cute.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.282
Oh! So sorry. Sorry.
Oh.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.821
Oh, no.
Don't worry about it.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.785
Actually, I read somewhere
that wearing a helmet

05:35.085 --> 05:36.996
reduces your
peripheral vision by 40%.

05:37.295 --> 05:37.830
Really?
No, I can't read.

I'm, uh, I'm looking
for a lock myself.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.963
There's a hobo
in my neighborhood

05:49.266 --> 05:50.256
who keeps trying
to steal my bike.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.640
Nice use
of the word "hobo."

05:51.935 --> 05:53.266
Makes him seem
more quaint, right?

05:53.562 --> 05:55.178
A "quaint"?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.016
Isn't that the space between a
gal's goal and her penalty box?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.475
I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLES)

06:00.777 --> 06:02.233
I'm gonna be
kinda forward here.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.985
Do you wanna get a coffee
with me sometime?

06:04.281 --> 06:05.897
| would love to.
(LAUGHS) I'd love to.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.451
But you know what? I've got
so much going on. So slammed.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.828
No, it's okay.
It's totally okay.

06:14.124 --> 06:14.989
Can't, uh,
can't blame a guy for trying.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.953
(BOTH CHUCKLES)

06:17.252 --> 06:19.289
All right.
Okay.

He's beautiful. | know.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.124
He's so cyah.
So cyah.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.664
So cyah.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.423
| can't go on a date
wearing this.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.006
Come on. He could be your
soul mate, your kindred spirit,

06:28.305 --> 06:29.295
your One Tree Hill.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.088
That's not the saying,
but you're right.

| cannot let this thing
hold me back.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.885

06:36.187 --> 06:37.177
Helmet doesn't have me.
(WHISPERS) That's right.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.639
Hey, Pete?
Hmm?

06:40.942 --> 06:43.274
Um, I'm actually
in for that coffee.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.607
Great!
What changed your mind?

06:45.906 --> 06:46.771
Uh, just some advice
from a friend.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.609
She's very wise.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.616
(THUD)

06:50.911 --> 06:52.322
(LAUGHS) This one's
top-notch. Barely felt that.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.824
Ah, she's a gem.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.626
(GROWLING)
Four sandos and counting.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.504
What's with the big appetite,
hungry puppy? (GROWLS)

07:03.798 --> 07:05.584
I'm carbo-fueling
my rage for Brody.

07:05.884 --> 07:06.749
Come on, man.
It was just a fist bump.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.384
It was... (SCOFFS)
Not just a fist bump!

07:09.679 --> 07:11.545
I'm sensitive, okay?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.055
This is not the first time
I've been handshake-betrayed.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.341
MAX: It was
the fifth damn grade.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.601
Jimmy Nichols offered me
a high-fiver.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.807
| accepted.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.221
Why not?
It would be rude not to.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.648
Then he offered me one
down low.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.230
Took that as well.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.233
Bam!

07:27.656 --> 07:29.522
Pulled that "too slow" crap

07:29.824 --> 07:32.031

David?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.546
All that pain...

07:50.845 --> 07:51.710
What's happening?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.048
It's my fault.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.891

"Down low, too slow."

07:58.186 --> 07:59.267
What?

07:59.562 --> 08:00.267
(WHISPERS)

08:03.858 --> 08:05.223
I'm sorry.
Dave!

08:05.527 --> 08:06.517
I'm sorry!
What are you talk...

08:06.820 --> 08:08.106
What about your truck?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.645
What are you talking about,
Candice?

08:09.948 --> 08:10.779
You'd look great
with bangs.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.405
(GROANS)
May I? Watch.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.900
Look at that. See?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.443
Al right.
(WOMEN LAUGHING)

08:16.746 --> 08:18.487
So then Denise comes back
from the garden center

08:18.790 --> 08:20.030
with another fountain.
Onh!

08:20.333 --> 08:21.664
That makes three.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.701
Oh! Hey, hey, hey!
I'm feeling you, guy.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.586
If shopping
were an Olympic sport,

08:25.880 --> 08:27.086
my wife would be...

08:28.216 --> 08:29.206
A fat bitch.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.749
(MEN LAUGH)

08:37.767 --> 08:39.303
(SCOFFS) You guys

08:39.602 --> 08:41.513
Brad is so spoiled,

08:41.813 --> 08:43.303
he can't sing Louie, Louie

08:43.606 --> 08:45.438

"vuitton, vuitton."

Ha ha! Kerkovich!

with the spousal abuse!

08:59.706 --> 09:00.696
Mmm.
Wow!

09:00.999 --> 09:01.830
Hey, let me ask you
something.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.615
Is there
a 10-inch whore here?

09:03.918 --> 09:04.953
'Cause that was a low blow!

09:05.253 --> 09:06.459
(LAUGHS)
MAN: Oh!

09:06.755 --> 09:07.916
Give me that,
dum-dum.

09:08.214 --> 09:08.954
(CHUCKLES)
That's for you.

09:09.257 --> 09:09.962
Oh.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.969
(WHIRRING)
(SINGSONGY) Hi!

09:16.264 --> 09:17.675
Wow! Well. (CHUCKLES)

09:17.974 --> 09:19.590
Listen, I know we talked
about coffee,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.008
but I thought we could do
something a little different,

09:21.311 --> 09:23.678
so I booked us
on a segway tour.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.015
What?
(CHUCKLES)

09:25.857 --> 09:27.222
Wow. Um...

09:27.525 --> 09:28.390
Thoughts? Comments?
Concerns?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.809
Uh, okay.
We could do that.

09:31.112 --> 09:31.943
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.603
| mean,
it's gonna be awesome.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.272
| know it's lame that they make
us wear these stupid helmets.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.691
| was all,
"Um, I think we're cool.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.985
"We're not gonna, like,
accidentally bang our heads on stuff."

09:40.288 --> 09:41.949
And the segway guy was all,

09:42.248 --> 09:43.864
"The president of our company
actually died tragically on one of these."

09:44.167 --> 09:46.499
And I was all,
"I'm sorry for your loss."”

09:46.795 --> 09:48.331
Okay, well, uh,
let's segway.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.166
Let's segway!
Let's segway.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.079
Okay, the tour company
is around the corner. Okay.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.292
Follow me, sir.
Yeah.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.798
But it's very intuitive.

09:54.094 --> 09:54.799
It's kind of an art,
is what I'm...

09:55.095 --> 09:56.460
Oh. Look out. jeez.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.003

Yeah, I'm good.

easier to do, in a weird way.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.181
(CRASH, CHAIR SCRAPES GROUND)
That's it, Penny.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.342
Try leaning another way.
Okay.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.396

You're dragging a chair.

Great party, Jane.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.526
And thanks

Baby, I am so sorry | left
you hanging with the guys.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.762
| got caught up with the wives,
and they would not let me go.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.426
It all worked out.

| got to shoot the bull
with the boys club all night.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.849
And they invited me

10:52.152 --> 10:53.938
to watch a game
with them after work!

10:54.237 --> 10:56.148
Oh, that's great!
| got invited out, too.

afterwards.

Me in the boys club,

11:39.324 --> 11:40.689
So... How are things
going with Pete?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.524
Not great.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.113
| mean,
| really like him

11:44.412 --> 11:45.777
and I even gave us
our own couple name.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.120
"P&P Romance Factory."

11:50.668 --> 11:52.158
But I do think he's
getting a little weirded out

11:52.462 --> 11:54.499
that I only wanna go on
dates where we wear helmets.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.788
Yesterday, we took a
moped safety course.

You're welcome...

yesterday, acting really weird,

12:08.394 --> 12:09.384

12:11.856 --> 12:13.972
You can still tell I'm
wearing a helmet, can't you?

12:14.275 --> 12:16.812
(SIGHS) Al, I don't think
this is gonna work.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.852
Really?
| think they're great.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.691
| don't know what
the two of you are up to.

| want no part of it.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.528
| need to go find Dave. So
make yourself useful and help me!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.076
(GASPS) Oh, no. This is bad.
He's into the sangria.

12:31.376 --> 12:31.740

What do you want?

12:32.043 --> 12:34.330
Good God, man!

That is the worst sangria
mouth I've ever seen

12:36.381 --> 12:37.837

12:38.132 --> 12:40.294
All the pain you suffered
from "Down low, too slow..."

12:40.593 --> 12:41.674

It's my fault.

12:41.970 --> 12:42.926

Dave... (SIGHS)

one lower down.

"Down low,"

12:52.063 --> 12:54.225

and I pulled it away,

12:54.524 --> 12:56.435

spilled from my lips...

12:56.734 --> 12:58.224
(WHISPERS)
Like poison.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.484
"Too slow."

Becky died that summer...

13:03.908 --> 13:05.148
Whoa! Unexpected turn.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.246

head and no one corrects you,

13:12.542 --> 13:14.579
but you keep believing it
even though it's crazy? Yeah.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.993
Till I was 13, | used to
think "Imno" was one letter.

been associated with,

Uh, you junk-talking me
in front of your coworkers.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.522
No. We always talk
about our wives.

That's how I bonded
with these guys.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.360
Ted always talks
about how dumb Sheila is.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.074
Keith talks about
Wanda's surgery addiction.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.689
Well, I planned us
this impromptu picnic.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.154

15:20.545 --> 15:22.707
You know what's crazy?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.791
Because of the helmet,
we never had sex.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.707
So instead, we just
got to know each other,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.376

15:29.679 --> 15:30.794
This helmet wasn't just
protecting my head.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.713
It was protecting my heart.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.256

from Iron man 2?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.642

15:37.937 --> 15:41.350

And she was all,
"That's not your ottoman!"

16:15.183 --> 16:17.140
And I was all, "Dressing
on the side, bitch!"

16:17.435 --> 16:18.971
(GASPS) And Dante has a
boat. You need to fix this right now.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.057

You got one.

So I need a new one.

What?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.342
(GASPS)
There he is.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.505
Now remember, let him
make the first move, then react.

No. Max! Max!

17:35.846 --> 17:37.462
Sorry, Brody.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.972
Max is just a little sensitive
about handshake stuff

17:40.268 --> 17:42.384
because someone did the whole
"Down low, too slow" thing to him

17:42.687 --> 17:44.018

It's a lot easier

Why not?
You did it to me.

Brad,
you're still here, huh?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.912
Figured you'd be at a, uh,
hotel patio bar by now,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.331
boobs-deep
in a red velvet margarita,

20:18.634 --> 20:19.920

So if you have a problem
with that,

20:34.358 --> 20:37.271
| suggest you take
that hood ornament

and do something
really painful

with it.

No one ever speaks
to the car czar like that.

But you are
my top salesperson,
