Previously on "The Originals"...

00:03.489 --> 00:05.999
I presume I have the misfortune
of speaking to my mother.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.603
I have come to heal our family.

00:07.604 --> 00:10.353
I'd prefer you both to
join me against our mother,

00:10.354 --> 00:12.355
but I'll happily
settle for one or the other.

00:12.356 --> 00:14.056
It is time you bring Camille in.

00:14.222 --> 00:17.279
Esther prepared your body
for someone to jump into.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.847
She was preparing you
for Rebekah.

00:18.848 --> 00:20.363
I have the baby,
and we're on the run.

00:20.364 --> 00:21.883
Esther found us.

00:21.884 --> 00:25.387
Then she made an offer
to make us all mortal again.

00:25.388 --> 00:26.734
[Gasps]

00:26.735 --> 00:28.595
Elijah: We mustn't let
the world ever hurt her.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.525
You're right.

00:30.526 --> 00:31.860
Those daggers
don't work on Klaus.

00:31.861 --> 00:35.530
It's not impossible to change
the dagger itself, so here.

00:35.531 --> 00:36.798
That's a giant diamond.

00:36.799 --> 00:37.966
It's a paragon diamond.

00:37.967 --> 00:39.382
Use them to conduct power.

00:39.383 --> 00:41.369
Klaus, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.390
- You can tell me on the way.
- Where are we going?

00:44.312 --> 00:45.539
To see our daughter.

01:13.568 --> 01:16.236
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.

01:43.898 --> 01:45.572
You sly old bat.

01:46.068 --> 01:48.269
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.

01:48.270 --> 01:52.740
This little beauty and I
have a date with a dagger.

01:52.741 --> 01:54.909
Klaus: You're looking
very dapper this evening, Kol.

01:54.910 --> 01:57.244
Though gloves
without a tailcoat.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.413
Unusual, wouldn't
you say, Klaus?

01:59.414 --> 02:01.148
I would unless
of course the gloves

02:01.149 --> 02:02.950
are utilitarian in nature.

02:02.951 --> 02:04.218
I didn't realize
you two lovebirds

02:04.219 --> 02:05.653
were interested in fashion.

02:05.654 --> 02:07.121
Oh, I can take it or leave it.

02:07.122 --> 02:09.056
Mayor Behrman on the other hand,

02:09.056 --> 02:11.258
now his style is impeccable,

02:11.259 --> 02:12.593
especially under present duress.

02:12.594 --> 02:14.795
Do you know he came
to me very concerned

02:14.796 --> 02:17.063
about the rash of
thefts in the city?

02:17.064 --> 02:18.732
So I put Marcel on it.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.359
And after a little digging,
I formed a theory

02:21.360 --> 02:24.279
as to the culprit,
so we followed our suspect.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.474
And he led us here
to the mansion

02:27.475 --> 02:31.111
of the recently deceased
dowager fauline.

02:31.112 --> 02:32.646
She was famous
for her collection

02:32.647 --> 02:36.316
of rare and priceless jewels,
most notably of course

02:36.317 --> 02:41.161
the perfect paragon diamond.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.888
Hand it over, Kol.

[Chanting]

02:58.872 --> 03:00.507
[Banging on doors]

03:00.508 --> 03:02.708
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!

03:05.158 --> 03:07.814
Oh, I wouldn't bother
waiting for them.

03:07.815 --> 03:12.410
You see, those women are never
leaving that house again.

03:12.411 --> 03:14.369
Merry Christmas, brother.

03:34.474 --> 03:36.518
Rebekah: Well, isn't
this place rather nice?

03:36.519 --> 03:38.912
Nik must have compelled
a wine lover

03:38.913 --> 03:42.055
to keep it up because
I found a 2005 bordeaux.

03:42.221 --> 03:43.216
Fancy a sip?

03:43.217 --> 03:44.784
I appreciate the sentiment,
Rebekah,

03:44.785 --> 03:49.990
but I do recognize when I'm
being handled with kid gloves.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.449
How are you feeling?

03:51.450 --> 03:52.724
Patronized.

03:56.029 --> 03:58.290
I am here to protect you.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.799
I know you mean to, Elijah.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.734
And yet you found it necessary
to render me unconscious

04:01.735 --> 04:03.148
before bringing me here.

04:03.254 --> 04:04.587
Well, you weren't yourself,

04:04.588 --> 04:06.965
and I needed to get us
out of that diner.

04:06.966 --> 04:09.642
What happened back there?

04:09.643 --> 04:11.276
I don't know.

04:13.913 --> 04:18.329
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.

04:18.356 --> 04:20.952
My job is to keep her safe.

04:25.738 --> 04:27.559
Both: Pwoteje sa.

04:37.804 --> 04:40.272
It's finished,
but I'm worried it's not enough

04:40.273 --> 04:42.141
to protect Cami's body
from Esther's magic.

04:42.142 --> 04:45.778
I might know a way to distract
you from your troubled mind.

04:45.779 --> 04:47.146
Marcel: You can take
this seriously,

04:47.147 --> 04:48.447
or I can lock you
in a coffin like

04:48.448 --> 04:50.282
your brother Finn if you prefer.

04:50.283 --> 04:52.635
Oh. No. I'd prefer
you to bugger off

04:52.636 --> 04:55.638
because this spell needs
time to cook in peace.

04:55.639 --> 04:57.356
Cami doesn't have time.

04:57.357 --> 04:59.625
Esther can jump anybody
into her body right now.

04:59.626 --> 05:01.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's
not gonna jump anybody, is she?

05:01.861 --> 05:03.375
She's gonna jump Rebekah,

05:03.481 --> 05:07.199
who just happens to be miles
away, but fair dues, Marcel.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.667
Think I'd be a bit testy, too,

05:08.668 --> 05:10.736
if my old ex was about
to jump into my new ex.

05:10.737 --> 05:12.530
I think that would be
a big, uh...

05:12.531 --> 05:14.273
Awkward?

05:14.274 --> 05:16.475
I was gonna say kinky, but...

05:16.476 --> 05:18.745
I appreciate
the chivalry, Marcel,

05:18.746 --> 05:23.482
but he'll have an easier time
protecting me if he's alive.

05:23.483 --> 05:25.016
Keep working.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.155
What is it with you two?

05:30.156 --> 05:34.302
It gets a bit old, plan
out in me own family.

05:34.303 --> 05:36.429
You know, Klaus,
Elijah, Rebekah,

05:36.430 --> 05:38.797
they were always a party of 3.

05:38.798 --> 05:41.199
No room for me at the table.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.469
There always seemed to be
room for Marcel.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.107
You know that diamond,
the one that I showed you?

05:47.108 --> 05:48.173
Mm-hmm.

05:48.174 --> 05:49.508
Well, that was the baby version.

05:49.509 --> 05:51.142
The one that we need
to do the dagger spell,

05:51.143 --> 05:52.946
well it has to be a lot bigger.

05:52.947 --> 05:55.680
100 years ago,
I had it in my hand.

05:55.681 --> 06:00.151
Then Marcel ratted me out
to Klaus, and they took it.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.871
He probably bloody well kept it.

06:01.872 --> 06:04.372
So let's steal it back.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.059
It's a good chance to snoop.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.838

You're making a mess of
my werewolf sentries, Mikael.

06:32.198 --> 06:34.351
And you're up
to your old tricks.

06:38.089 --> 06:41.151
Esther...

06:41.317 --> 06:45.063
I missed you, wife.

06:45.064 --> 06:46.708
Have you missed me?

06:46.709 --> 06:49.502
As much as you've
missed me, I imagine.

06:49.503 --> 06:52.005
That would explain why you
brought your lover back

06:52.006 --> 06:55.258
from the other side without
so much as a thought of me.

06:55.259 --> 06:59.677
I will slaughter
every single wolf I see

06:59.678 --> 07:01.846

07:01.847 --> 07:04.017

back from the dead.

Klaus killed him.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.353
Klaus may not be your blood,

07:09.354 --> 07:10.621
be he certainly has
picked up a few things

07:10.622 --> 07:11.789
from you along the way.

if not consistent.

Go ahead. Strike me.
I imagine you've been

07:22.133 --> 07:23.801
waiting a thousand years
to do so.

07:23.802 --> 07:25.335
Hyah!

07:32.463 --> 07:35.819
Now that you've got
that out your system,

07:35.845 --> 07:39.342
we have things to discuss
about our children.

07:42.286 --> 07:43.620
It's all right, Elijah.

07:43.621 --> 07:46.256
She won't break.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.492
Everything you did was in
the name of protecting her.

07:48.493 --> 07:49.792
I'm not worried.

07:52.945 --> 07:54.974
Is that what I think it is?

07:55.533 --> 07:59.536
It's bonfire season,
and I am reviving a family tradition,

07:59.537 --> 08:02.005
especially since we're
all going to be together.

08:02.006 --> 08:05.161
Only because we're fleeing from
one of our deranged parents,

08:05.162 --> 08:07.344
another Mikaelson
family tradition.

08:07.345 --> 08:09.646
It's a peculiar thing

08:09.647 --> 08:12.188
never to be tired
yet forever exhausted

08:12.214 --> 08:15.619
with the sameness of things.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.189
Why is our family always at war?

08:19.190 --> 08:22.125
I don't know,
but being away with her

08:22.126 --> 08:25.056
made me see things differently.

08:25.057 --> 08:26.795
We're not so bad.

08:28.814 --> 08:32.467
Not the monsters
that our parents think we are.

08:33.235 --> 08:36.505
[Car approaching]

09:06.769 --> 09:08.431
Hi.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.731
Curse on the first born?

09:57.732 --> 09:59.166
What the bloody hell
is that supposed to be?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.434
Well, according to Finn,
our sister freya

10:00.435 --> 10:01.735
didn't die of plague.

10:01.736 --> 10:03.853
She was taken as payment
by our aunt dahlia,

10:04.019 --> 10:08.242
who then cursed all Mikaelson
first borns for eternity.

10:08.243 --> 10:09.576
Is any of this true?

10:09.577 --> 10:11.144
Elijah: It is if
we're to believe Finn,

10:11.145 --> 10:13.280
who learned it from
that bastion of truth, our mother.

10:13.281 --> 10:15.349
Well, no wonder Finn hates us.

10:15.350 --> 10:16.550
He lost the sister
he adored and instead

10:16.551 --> 10:20.053
got a judgy pack of siblings,
who found him unbearably dull.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.655
Great. So is there
any chance of us

10:21.656 --> 10:24.467
running into your loony
aunt dahlia anytime soon?

10:24.468 --> 10:26.626
Fable's over
a thousand years old.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.295
Dahlia's long dead.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.640
Like Esther?

10:30.641 --> 10:32.412
No one's going to hurt hope

10:32.438 --> 10:34.301
because no one's
going to find her.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.969
It's enough wood, Rebekah.

10:35.970 --> 10:38.356
You'll burn down the whole
bloody state of Arkansas.

10:38.357 --> 10:40.441
Well, we're just missing
a key ingredient.

10:40.442 --> 10:41.943
No, we're not.

10:41.944 --> 10:44.244
Yes, we are, Nik.
Back me up, Elijah.

10:44.245 --> 10:46.301
I suspect Niklaus would
rather choke on the ashes.

10:46.327 --> 10:47.989
What are you all talking about?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.717
Well, before we light it,
we write down

10:50.718 --> 10:52.752
our wishes for each other
to burn for luck.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.081
It was Kol's favorite
part when were kids.

10:55.082 --> 10:57.312
Further evidence as to
why we should ignore it.

10:57.418 --> 11:01.024
Hope's first bonfire season.

11:01.050 --> 11:02.795
I like it.
We're doing it.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.826
You ditched me.

11:11.852 --> 11:14.541
You have my fake therapist
locked in that coffin.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.695
What better way to spend
my potential final hours.

11:20.861 --> 11:24.050
Try not to think about it.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.685
I can't help it, Marcel.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.121
At any moment,
I could cease to exist,

11:28.122 --> 11:30.887
and the one person
who can make a difference

11:30.913 --> 11:33.192
is 10 feet away
and locked in a box.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.393
I need to talk to him.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.329
You're not talking to Finn.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.331
Maybe he'll listen,
maybe he'll call his mom off.

11:38.332 --> 11:41.002
It's a million to one,
but it's better than doing nothing.

11:41.003 --> 11:43.936
I said no, Cami.

11:43.937 --> 11:49.008
Marcel, I am hours away from
someone taking control of my body.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.711
I highly suggest you
avoid trying to control me

11:51.712 --> 11:53.712
between now and then.

11:57.147 --> 11:59.395
[Music playing]

11:59.396 --> 12:00.978

12:03.222 --> 12:05.985
I'm holding
a small child, Hayley.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.769
This silly wish game
will have to wait.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.697
You write, I'll hold.

12:09.698 --> 12:11.764
You do realize it is not
I who is to be the husband

12:11.765 --> 12:13.659
you can boss around.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.768
You do realize I had to
endure horrendous labor

12:15.769 --> 12:18.955
and actual death birthing
the child that you're holding.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.174
Fine.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.113
I wish you would tell Elijah

12:28.114 --> 12:30.384
you're marrying your
werewolf suitor,

12:30.385 --> 12:32.845
at which point I will
pour him a scotch

12:32.846 --> 12:36.888
and congratulate him
on the bullet he dodged.

12:48.282 --> 12:50.936
Marcel: I'm only doing this
because it means so much to you,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.438
but if it's not safe,
I'm staying,

12:52.604 --> 12:55.993
not to control you,
to protect you.

12:55.994 --> 12:57.909
He won't talk to me
if you're here, Marcel,

12:57.910 --> 13:00.663
and he's in no shape
to pick a fight.

13:15.476 --> 13:17.228
I'll be outside.

13:19.564 --> 13:20.699
I'm not much of a cook,

13:20.700 --> 13:24.687
but I do make
a mean grilled cheese.

13:25.171 --> 13:28.234
You're a compassionate
woman Camille.

13:28.235 --> 13:33.044
It's your fatal flaw, and
it will be your downfall.

13:33.045 --> 13:36.715
Well, that got dark fast.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.783
Come on. Eat.
You must be starving.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.247
I will not be tempted
by your beauty,

13:41.248 --> 13:45.623
nor will I be blinded
by your empathy.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.893
You don't leave a girl
much wiggle room.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.328
I would appeal to your morals,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.764
but those seem to be
all over the map.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.332
I'm not the one who was
sleeping with one vampire

13:54.333 --> 13:57.972
while half in love with another.

13:57.973 --> 14:00.057
Your morality is
a moving target.

14:00.058 --> 14:01.267
Mine is not.

14:01.268 --> 14:03.041
You believe people can change.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.009
You're still seeking out
Klaus' redemption

14:05.010 --> 14:06.477
as if that were a thing
that was even possible.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.316
Elijah seeks it out.

14:08.317 --> 14:11.516
Even my own mother seeks it out,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.752
but I do not believe
in redemption.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.575
I believe in right and wrong.

14:17.576 --> 14:22.527
I believe in good and evil.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.595
Maybe in some
comic book universe...

14:24.596 --> 14:26.831
You don't even see it,
but I'm trying to help

14:26.832 --> 14:28.836
people like you.

14:28.837 --> 14:30.034
I don't believe you.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.503
That is to your peril
because when I'm free

14:32.504 --> 14:35.106
I will not stop
until every single vampire

14:35.107 --> 14:37.708
in New Orleans has
ceased to exist,

14:37.709 --> 14:39.644
and I will show
no mercy to anyone

15:23.884 --> 15:25.384
Thank you.

What is it you see when
you go away like that?

15:33.276 --> 15:37.530
Things I've done,
images of who I was.

15:41.503 --> 15:44.807
Another gift from mother.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.241
I can't turn it off.

15:46.242 --> 15:48.416
I suppose it's her way
of demonstrating

15:48.417 --> 15:50.445
I'd be better off
taking her deal.

15:50.446 --> 15:53.170
To leave your body behind?

To start over, to
live a mortal life,

my own if I choose.

16:00.156 --> 16:02.958
Cursed as your first born if
we're to believe the story.

16:02.959 --> 16:05.433
Not if I am no longer
Mikaelson blood.

16:05.434 --> 16:07.562
See, this is the beauty
of mother, Rebekah.

16:07.563 --> 16:10.065
Sometimes, even her
darkest deeds

16:10.066 --> 16:12.813
possess a logic that's
difficult to refute.

16:16.738 --> 16:18.341
It's a lovely fantasy, elljah.

16:18.447 --> 16:21.209
Rebekah, you and I both know
what mother is capable of.

16:21.210 --> 16:25.045
Now I do wonder if she would
relent and leave us be.

16:27.482 --> 16:31.083
Now what if all that mother
needs is a victory.

16:31.084 --> 16:33.555
Let her find it somewhere else.

16:33.556 --> 16:35.212
Besides, she wants all 3 of us.

She has Kol, she has Finn.

a simple majority will do.

You never talk about her.

There's not much to say really.

17:15.564 --> 17:16.964
She was always their girl.

to tell Nik.

What if I said I'm close
to finishing a dagger

than he's done to us.

we'd be killing him,

she needed a win,

then she'll have one.

Hopefully, we won't
have to use her.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.732
Hopefully, but then my mother

26:38.733 --> 26:41.676
is a wily and vindictive woman,

26:41.677 --> 26:44.245
which is why I've got to
ask something else of you.

26:44.246 --> 26:46.080
You're already getting
the diamond.

26:46.081 --> 26:49.417
Which I'm thrilled about, but
in order for me to help you,

26:49.418 --> 26:51.119
I need access to
my mother's hourglass,

26:51.120 --> 26:54.915
which is in
the lycee with my mother.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.124
So?

26:56.125 --> 26:57.825
Well, I haven't been
back in a while,

26:57.826 --> 26:59.193
and the only way she won't
suspect me is if I bring back

26:59.194 --> 27:01.004
the thing that
I was sent to find.

27:01.005 --> 27:02.896
And that thing is?

27:05.032 --> 27:06.500
The white oak stake.

27:06.501 --> 27:07.928
Are you out of your mind?

27:07.929 --> 27:09.537
Kaleb!

27:09.538 --> 27:11.505
Look. It's the only way
that she's gonna trust me.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.807
She doesn't want to kill them.

27:12.808 --> 27:14.442
She just wants to make
sure that the weapon

27:14.443 --> 27:18.913
doesn't fall in the wrong hands.

27:18.914 --> 27:20.448
I swear as soon as she's gone,

27:20.449 --> 27:22.234
I'll give it
right back to Klaus.

27:22.235 --> 27:24.518
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.052
Klaus: Kol!

27:29.746 --> 27:32.193
Whatever grudges
you hold against me,

27:32.194 --> 27:34.903
we are doing this
for the good of our family.

27:35.069 --> 27:39.166
Do I have your word that for
once you will honor that?

27:39.167 --> 27:41.086
You have my word, Nik.

27:41.087 --> 27:45.306
Swear on the fate of us all.

27:45.307 --> 27:46.939
Take the stake.

27:55.185 --> 27:57.488
I wooed her, I won her.

27:57.489 --> 28:01.525
Took a while, but in the
end, she handed it to me.

28:01.526 --> 28:02.759
When I didn't hear from you,

28:02.760 --> 28:04.474
I thought you
might be in trouble.

28:05.029 --> 28:06.997
Nope. No trouble.

28:06.998 --> 28:08.432
Just hard to do espionage

28:08.433 --> 28:11.334
when you're calling
mummy all the time.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.170
So where's Finn.
Is he off playing emperor

28:13.171 --> 28:15.272
to his merry pack of dogs?

28:15.273 --> 28:16.840
I'm afraid Finn may have fallen

28:16.841 --> 28:18.675
into the hands of your brothers,

28:18.676 --> 28:21.511
but I've made a plan to
assist him with that dilemma

28:21.512 --> 28:25.115
while I continue
my search for Rebekah.

28:25.116 --> 28:29.885
Oh. Speak of the devil,
and the devil will come.

28:29.886 --> 28:31.793
Hello, sister.

28:32.356 --> 28:35.358
Kol, it really is you.

28:35.359 --> 28:37.974
I would know
that smirk anywhere.

28:41.231 --> 28:44.191
Hello, mother.

28:44.192 --> 28:45.857
I believe you're
offering a deal.

28:48.438 --> 28:51.274
Kaleb will link this
hourglass to Esther's.

28:51.275 --> 28:52.509
Ours will mirror hers.

28:52.510 --> 28:55.979
When last sand falls, Esther
will try to jump her into you.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.647
That's when I'll redirect
the spell from you to Esther.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.215
It's meant to jam
the signal just long enough

28:59.216 --> 29:01.782
to keep that kind of magic
from working against anyone.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.919
If it works.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.621
It will work.
When Rebekah attacks,

29:04.622 --> 29:06.155
Esther won't be able
to jump her into you

29:06.156 --> 29:07.964
or herself anywhere else.

29:07.965 --> 29:10.050
And we're sure Kaleb
is on board?

29:10.051 --> 29:12.197
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar,

29:12.223 --> 29:14.678
but like Elijah,
he doesn't give his word lightly.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.309
Rebekah: You can't possibly
expect me to discuss

29:19.310 --> 29:21.337
giving up eternal life over tea.

29:21.813 --> 29:23.438
Give me some of that
red over there.

29:23.439 --> 29:24.673
Pfft.

29:27.877 --> 29:29.445
Well, where's the sales pitch?

29:29.446 --> 29:31.822
I only offer what
you already want.

29:31.823 --> 29:33.382
And how do you presume
to know that?

29:33.383 --> 29:36.853
Elijah is happiest when
there is order and music,

29:36.854 --> 29:41.591
Klaus when he's the center
of attention and in control,

29:41.592 --> 29:47.463
but you are my only child
capable of unfettered joy,

29:47.464 --> 29:50.299
and you're happiest
amongst humans.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.669
I've seen you year for that life,
for love.

29:53.670 --> 29:58.160
And when am I happiest
then, mother?

29:58.186 --> 30:00.075
When you're doing
as you're told.

30:05.781 --> 30:08.951
Our wishes are aligned
in this, my daughter,

30:08.952 --> 30:13.255
mine to free you from this
curse and yours to be human.

30:13.256 --> 30:15.190
I'd be giving up
everything I've ever known

30:15.191 --> 30:17.126
for a memory
of something I once was,

30:17.127 --> 30:20.954
power for weakness,
strength for frailty,

30:20.955 --> 30:23.874
eternal life for a brief
human existence.

30:23.875 --> 30:27.669
The choice is simple.

30:27.670 --> 30:32.174
Another thousand years of
never having what you want

30:32.175 --> 30:36.823
or a handful of years
when you do.

30:43.518 --> 30:48.924
Well, then.
To the end of an era.

30:48.925 --> 30:51.526

31:17.765 --> 31:19.788
What the bloody hell
is that doing here?

31:19.789 --> 31:23.161
As each of you comes to your
senses and takes my offer,

31:23.187 --> 31:25.268
I will destroy
your vampire bodies.

31:25.269 --> 31:27.595
Mother, you said you wanted
the stake to protect them.

31:27.596 --> 31:29.931
Yes, but not
in their current bodies.

31:29.932 --> 31:32.734
Once they accept my offer, I
will be righting two wrongs...

31:32.735 --> 31:34.027
No.

31:34.028 --> 31:35.970
Having brought this
evil into the world

31:35.971 --> 31:38.473
and having subjected
my own children to it.

31:38.474 --> 31:39.674
No. That wasn't the deal.

31:39.675 --> 31:40.875
Stop the spell!

31:40.876 --> 31:43.111
The spell is already done.

31:43.112 --> 31:44.779
I prepared it to be locked in

31:44.780 --> 31:47.330

the hourglass.

31:56.524 --> 31:57.759
Marcel: Now.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.093
Not yet.

31:59.094 --> 32:00.461
Mother, think this through.

32:00.462 --> 32:01.696
You gave birth to this body.

32:01.697 --> 32:02.897
You can't destroy it.

32:02.898 --> 32:05.500
I am only destroying its flesh.

32:05.501 --> 32:08.769
Your beautiful soul will live
on in the body of another.

32:08.770 --> 32:12.707
I have chosen well for you,
a beautiful girl, strong.

32:12.708 --> 32:15.235
Klaus: Mother!

32:15.236 --> 32:16.477
Stop the spell.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.697
You and your traitorous son.

32:18.698 --> 32:21.282
Nik, I didn't know
anything about it, I swear.

32:21.283 --> 32:24.452
Oh, good. I'm glad you two
boys are friends again.

32:24.453 --> 32:27.855
I did wonder what you'd been
up to in your time away.

32:27.856 --> 32:28.957
Now I know.

32:28.958 --> 32:31.492
Stop the blasted spell.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.127
I'm afraid that's impossible.

32:33.128 --> 32:34.963
Anything is possible.

32:34.964 --> 32:36.497
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!

32:36.498 --> 32:39.738
If only you'd taken my offer
when it was still mine to give.

32:39.764 --> 32:41.669
Unfortunately, you've
left me no choice

32:41.670 --> 32:44.514
but to make a deal with Mikael.

32:44.515 --> 32:46.850
Mikael?

32:46.851 --> 32:52.042
When Finn and Kol went
missing, I needed a new ally.

32:52.068 --> 32:55.231
All he wanted was
the right to kill you.

32:58.074 --> 33:01.588
Kol, I would ask you to deliver
the stake to your father,

33:01.589 --> 33:04.825
but it seems your loyalties
have been compromised.

33:04.826 --> 33:07.162
Stop the spell, Esther!

33:07.163 --> 33:08.872
No. It's ok, Nik.
I can do this.

33:08.873 --> 33:10.540
So you're feeling
murderous again.

33:10.541 --> 33:13.434
You should know
I've already chosen my next body.

in such a good mood?

had done me a solid back in 1914?

Swore she hadn't told Klaus
that I was taking the diamond back.

has no business dating Kol.

when the Mikaelsons arrived

with us the tradition
