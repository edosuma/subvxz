Unh.
Unh.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.787
- Aah!

02:18.338 --> 02:21.240
- Hail Kobra.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.408
Hail Kobra.

Young Justice - Season 1, Episode 4
"Drop Zone"

03:12.400 --> 03:14.869
- We're approaching
Santa Prisca.

03:22.177 --> 03:23.878
- Isla Santa Prisca.

03:23.945 --> 03:26.447
This island nation
is the primary source

03:26.515 --> 03:29.316
Of a dangerous and illegal
neosteroid--

03:29.384 --> 03:33.153
A strength enhancing drug sold
under the street name "Venom."

03:33.221 --> 03:35.789
Infrared heat signatures
indicate their factory

03:35.857 --> 03:38.158
Is still operating
at full capacity,

03:38.226 --> 03:41.462
But all shipments of Venom
have been inexplicably cut off.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.163
That's where this team comes in.

03:43.231 --> 03:46.467
This is a covert
recon mission only.

03:46.535 --> 03:48.135
Observe and report.

03:48.203 --> 03:51.138
If the Justice League
needs to intervene, it will.

03:51.206 --> 03:53.841
The plan requires
two drop zones.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.743
- So who's in charge?

03:58.146 --> 03:59.980
- Work that out between you.

04:04.319 --> 04:06.754
- Drop zone "A" in 30.

04:11.927 --> 04:13.027
- Ready.

04:13.094 --> 04:15.329
- Putting bioship
in camouflage mode.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.924
- Heat and motion sensors
are patched.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.328
Data is now on
a continuous loop. Move in.

04:50.432 --> 04:52.066
- Drop zone "B."

05:01.610 --> 05:03.777
- How cool is this?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.813
- Very impressive.

05:12.287 --> 05:14.388
- Uh, that works, too.

05:14.456 --> 05:18.125
Hey, Supey, not too late
to put on the new stealth tech.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.729
- No capes, no tights.
No offense.

05:21.796 --> 05:23.564
- It totally works for you...

05:23.632 --> 05:28.669
In that you can totally
do good work in those clothes.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.250
- Knew I didn't need a line.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.753
- And yet creating
a seismic event

05:45.820 --> 05:48.088
May not have helped us much
with the covert.

05:49.658 --> 05:51.992
- Aqualad, drop "B" is go.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.360
- Head for the factory.

05:53.428 --> 05:56.063
I'll track your GPS
and rendezvous ASAP.

05:56.131 --> 05:57.931
- Roger that.

06:17.519 --> 06:18.719
- Did you hear that?

06:18.787 --> 06:20.487
- Uh, no. Wait.

06:20.555 --> 06:22.122
Is this a super hearing thing?

06:22.190 --> 06:24.124
- You do have great ears.

06:24.192 --> 06:26.060
- Ok, Rob, now what?

06:26.127 --> 06:28.328
Man, I hate it
when he does that.

06:28.396 --> 06:30.698
- Superboy, Kid,
switch to infrared.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.133
See if you're being tracked.

06:36.805 --> 06:39.006
- Got a squad
of armed bozos incoming.

06:43.311 --> 06:45.679
- Two squads.

06:45.747 --> 06:48.282
But they'll meet each other
before they find us.

06:49.517 --> 06:51.251
- No super hearing required now.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.087
- Swing wide, steer clear.

06:53.154 --> 06:55.089
- Yeah, as soon as I find Rob.

06:58.093 --> 06:59.526
- Huh? Oof!

07:05.734 --> 07:07.234
Aah!

07:13.708 --> 07:16.744
So much for the stealthy.

07:22.547 --> 07:23.881
Whoa!

07:25.083 --> 07:27.084
Whoa.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.420
- Unh!

07:33.424 --> 07:34.925
Aah!

07:39.097 --> 07:41.932
- Hyah! What is wrong
with you guys? Remember covert?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.368
Why didn't you follow my lead,
vanish into the jungle?

07:46.037 --> 07:48.572
- That's what you were doing?
Way to fill us in.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.641
We're not mind readers,
you know.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.409
- Unh!

07:52.477 --> 07:54.378
- Er, I'm not anyway.

07:54.445 --> 07:57.147
- You told me I could only read
the bad guys' minds.

08:00.652 --> 08:02.252
- Aah!

08:09.394 --> 08:11.061
- I recognize those uniforms.

08:11.129 --> 08:12.996
They belong to the cult
of the Kobra.

08:13.064 --> 08:14.998
- I am certain Batman
would have mentioned it

08:15.066 --> 08:16.566
If he knew a dangerous extremist

08:16.634 --> 08:18.936
Was running Santa Prisca's
Venom operation.

08:19.003 --> 08:21.672
- Agreed. And since
there's clearly no love lost

08:21.739 --> 08:23.273
Between the cultists
and those goons,

08:23.341 --> 08:25.475
I'm betting Kobra came in
and tossed them out.

08:25.543 --> 08:28.011
That's why normal supply lines
have been cut off.

08:28.079 --> 08:30.113
- We get it.
Kobra wanted super cultists.

08:30.181 --> 08:32.249
Mystery solved. Radio Bats,
and we'll be home in time--

08:32.317 --> 08:34.116
- These cultists
aren't on Venom.

08:34.184 --> 08:37.020
Kobra's hoarding the stuff.
We don't leave.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.755
Not until I know why.

08:38.823 --> 08:40.590
<i>- Until you know why?</i>

08:40.658 --> 08:41.892
- This team needs a leader.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.028
- And it's you?
Dude, you're a 13-year-old Kid

08:45.096 --> 08:46.763
Who ducked out on us
without a word.

08:46.831 --> 08:48.865
- Ha ha! And you're a mature 15?

08:48.933 --> 08:50.801
You blew our cover
first chance you got.

08:50.868 --> 08:52.636
- Don't you want to lead?

08:52.704 --> 08:54.471
you?

08:54.539 --> 08:56.473
- After the mister
Twister fiasco?

08:56.541 --> 08:57.941
- You did all right.

09:13.558 --> 09:15.792
- Yeah? You don't even have
super powers!

09:15.860 --> 09:17.427
- Neither does Batman!

09:17.495 --> 09:19.596
- Duh, you're not Batman.

09:19.664 --> 09:21.832
- Duh, closest thing we've got.

09:24.736 --> 09:26.503
Such clever ninos.

09:26.571 --> 09:28.605
But you only know
half the story.

09:28.673 --> 09:30.340
Let me show you the rest--

09:30.408 --> 09:33.343
Get you into the factory
via my secret entrance.

09:33.411 --> 09:35.312
- There is a secret entrance,

09:35.380 --> 09:38.248
But he's also hiding something.

09:39.217 --> 09:41.351
- Ah, ah, ah, chica.

09:41.419 --> 09:43.086
Bane is not that easy.

09:43.154 --> 09:47.524
- Ohh. He's mentally reciting
futbol scores en espanol.

09:47.592 --> 09:48.959
This could take a while.

09:49.027 --> 09:50.360
- It's not complicated.

09:50.428 --> 09:54.431
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

09:59.771 --> 10:02.706
- Sublime master, he approaches.

10:02.774 --> 10:05.208
- Activate the radio
jamming net.

10:05.276 --> 10:07.511
Nothing must interfere.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.726
- Look at all that product.

10:22.794 --> 10:24.461
A buy is going down.

10:24.529 --> 10:27.564
But if Kobra's not selling
to the usual suspects, then--

10:27.632 --> 10:29.299
- We need to identify
that buyer.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.001
- Just what I was thinking.

10:31.069 --> 10:32.903
- Yeah, you're the thinker.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.738
- Sarcasm? Dude.

10:34.806 --> 10:37.340
A real leader would focus
on getting answers.

10:40.244 --> 10:43.447
Answers are this way.

10:45.483 --> 10:48.652
- So, now el luchador
is our leader.

11:08.773 --> 11:10.774
- All clear.

11:13.678 --> 11:16.379
- Has that little fool
already been caught?

11:16.447 --> 11:18.315
- No, he just does that.

11:18.382 --> 11:21.051
- Stay put. I'll get our intel
and be back before the boy wonder.

11:21.119 --> 11:22.719
- Wait, Kid!

11:22.787 --> 11:25.622
- Great chain of command.

11:29.961 --> 11:32.295
Huh?

11:38.302 --> 11:39.636
- It's a massive shipment.

11:39.704 --> 11:42.305
- Yeah, but they're only
taking new product off the line.

11:42.373 --> 11:45.408
They're not touching this Venom.

11:45.476 --> 11:47.410
- Maybe freshness counts?

11:47.478 --> 11:49.646
- Helicopters coming.

11:57.255 --> 11:59.356
- Whatcha got?

11:59.423 --> 12:00.957
- Chemical formulas.

12:01.025 --> 12:03.026
I'm guessing it involves Venom,
but...

12:03.094 --> 12:05.862
- This one's Venom,
and that one's--

12:05.930 --> 12:07.197
whoa.

12:07.265 --> 12:09.132
The blockbuster formula
from cadmus.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.034
Mixed correctly,
Kobra's new juice is

12:11.102 --> 12:13.370
3 times stronger
than Venom...

12:13.437 --> 12:14.704
And permanent.

12:14.772 --> 12:17.407
But how did Kobra get access to
project blockbuster?

12:17.475 --> 12:21.211
- Our mystery buyer must also be
Kobra's supplier!

12:21.279 --> 12:24.881
Using the cult to create a
blockbuster Venom super formula.

12:24.949 --> 12:27.384
Robin to Aqualad, we got--

12:27.451 --> 12:28.552
- Static.

12:39.630 --> 12:41.865
- Lord Kobra.
- Sportsmaster.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.868
The shipment is ready.

12:45.870 --> 12:48.471
- The new Kobra Venom?

12:48.539 --> 12:50.140
- A complete success.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.009
Our friends
will not be disappointed.

12:53.077 --> 12:55.011
- This is a game-changer.

12:55.079 --> 13:00.350
Finally, we can go mano-a-mano
with the Justice League.

13:00.418 --> 13:04.588
- Aqualad, sending you a
telepathic image of the buyer now.

13:09.093 --> 13:12.028
- Sportsmaster.
He is the buyer?

13:12.096 --> 13:14.531
Aqualad to Red Tornado.
Do you read?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.735
- Ugh. Can't reach
the League, Robin, or Kid.

13:18.803 --> 13:22.172
Comm's jammed.
We need a plan, no

13:22.240 --> 13:24.140
- I have a suggestion.

13:28.713 --> 13:29.980
What is he--

13:40.000 --> 13:41.801
Destroy them.

14:26.713 --> 14:28.814
Miss Martian, radio is jammed!

14:28.882 --> 14:30.216
Link us up!

14:31.285 --> 14:32.385
everyone online?

14:32.452 --> 14:34.153
yeah.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.655
you know it, beautiful.

14:35.722 --> 14:37.156
good. We need to regroup.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.724
- Busy now.

14:39.559 --> 14:41.294
- Batman must be desperate

14:41.361 --> 14:43.996
If he sends his whelp
to task me.

14:44.064 --> 14:46.499
- What's wrong, Koby?
You look disconcerted.

14:46.566 --> 14:51.137
- This is beneath me.
Shimmer, take him.

14:52.673 --> 14:55.341
- Robin, now!

15:04.551 --> 15:06.986
- Strategic retreat.
Kid, clear a path.

15:24.638 --> 15:26.605
- Superboy,
the support beams!

15:45.125 --> 15:48.661
- How could my first mission
as leader go so wrong?

15:48.729 --> 15:50.997
- You do have
the most experience.

15:51.064 --> 15:53.799
Perhaps that is exactly
what has left you unprepared.

15:53.867 --> 15:56.969
Fighting alongside Batman,
your roles are defined.

15:57.037 --> 15:58.637
You two do not need to talk.

15:58.705 --> 16:00.206
But this team is new.

16:00.273 --> 16:03.042
And a leader must be
clear, explicit.

16:03.110 --> 16:05.044
He cannot vanish
and expect others

16:05.112 --> 16:06.846
To play parts
in an unknown plan.

16:06.913 --> 16:09.482
- Oh, so I'm supposed to hold
everyone's hands.

16:09.549 --> 16:12.818
who am I Kidding?

16:12.886 --> 16:14.587
You should lead us,
kaldur.

16:14.654 --> 16:16.122
You're
the only one who can.

16:16.189 --> 16:19.058
- Please! I can run circles--
- wally, come on.

16:19.126 --> 16:21.093
You know he's the one.
We all do.

16:21.161 --> 16:24.296
- Hello, m'gann.
It's so obvious.

16:24.364 --> 16:25.865
- Could have told you.

16:29.236 --> 16:31.737
- Ok.

16:31.805 --> 16:33.906
- Then I accept the burden

16:33.974 --> 16:36.876
Until you are ready
to lift it from my shoulders.

16:36.943 --> 16:39.211
You were born
to lead this team--

16:39.279 --> 16:42.281
Maybe not now,
but soon.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.118
All right.
Our first priority is

16:46.186 --> 16:48.120
Preventing that shipment
from leaving this island.

16:48.188 --> 16:50.122
- Funny.
I had the same thought.

16:52.526 --> 16:54.894
- Sabotage.
Robin?

16:54.961 --> 16:58.798
- Undoubtedly.
Find the problem. Fix it.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.269
- Master, shall we send search
parties after the intruders?

17:03.336 --> 17:06.305
- Don't be absurd.
They'll come to us.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.840
- Sportsmaster's
the supplier/buyer.

17:08.909 --> 17:10.476
But it still doesn't track.

17:10.544 --> 17:12.912
He doesn't have the juice to
acquire the blockbuster formula

17:12.979 --> 17:14.914
Or to get Kobra to do
his dirty work.

17:14.981 --> 17:17.916
- And neither of them have the
chops to bond blockbuster with Venom.

17:17.983 --> 17:19.718
That took
some major nerdage.

17:19.786 --> 17:23.289
- I believe the expression is
"tip of thiceberg."

17:26.526 --> 17:28.227
- Halt, ninos.

17:28.295 --> 17:31.263
I'm feeling explosive.

17:31.331 --> 17:33.933
you betrayed us. Why?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.701
- I want my factory back.

17:35.769 --> 17:37.269
- Kid,
you'll need a running start.

17:37.337 --> 17:39.038
- So I forced you
into a situation

17:39.106 --> 17:43.209
Where you would either take
down my enemies or die trying.

17:43.276 --> 17:46.645
If the latter, the Justice
League would certainly have come

17:46.713 --> 17:48.380
To avenge
their sidekicks.

17:48.448 --> 17:50.049
And when
the smoke cleared,

17:50.117 --> 17:53.252
Santa prisca would be mine
once more.

17:53.320 --> 17:58.257
Blowing the tunnel with you
inside should have the same effect.

17:58.325 --> 18:00.159
- With what?

18:00.227 --> 18:01.660
This trigger thingy?

18:07.067 --> 18:11.103
- Finally.
Drop him.

18:11.171 --> 18:12.771
- Aah!

18:15.609 --> 18:18.210
- The helicopter is operational,
exalted one.

18:23.984 --> 18:26.352
- Take the shipment!

18:29.222 --> 18:30.322
- Go again?

18:33.260 --> 18:35.261
- Sorry. Not the plan.

18:59.753 --> 19:02.021
- Souvenir.
- Unh!

19:05.725 --> 19:08.060
- I know you hate getting
your hands dirty.

19:08.128 --> 19:09.728
- True.

19:09.796 --> 19:13.666
But sometimes, even a god
must stoop to conquer.

19:20.974 --> 19:25.244
- What's wrong, boy?
You look disconcerted.

19:41.294 --> 19:43.362
- Thanks for the workout,
but I got to fly.

20:23.503 --> 20:26.405
- I am plagued
by mosquitoes.

20:26.473 --> 20:28.073
good,

20:28.141 --> 20:31.777
'cause this mosquito's
mighty concerted over your pain.

20:38.018 --> 20:41.487
- Another time, then.

20:50.096 --> 20:52.431
- We picked
the right guy to lead.

20:52.499 --> 20:56.602
Automatically making you the right
guy to explain this mess to Batman.

21:04.878 --> 21:09.248
- A simple recon mission,
observe and report.

21:09.316 --> 21:11.483
You'll each receive
a written evaluation

21:11.551 --> 21:14.153
Detailing your many mistakes.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.621
Until then,

21:15.689 --> 21:17.356
Good job.

21:18.892 --> 21:22.161
No battle plan survives
first contact with the enemy.

21:22.228 --> 21:26.265
How you adjust to the unforeseen
is what determines success.

21:26.333 --> 21:30.336
And how you choose who leads
determines character.

21:33.707 --> 21:38.110
- All I recovered is
a single ampoule of Kobra Venom.

21:38.178 --> 21:40.813
- Peut-etre the drug can be
reverse engineered.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.881
Mais,
what of our young heroes?

21:42.949 --> 21:45.818
First, Cadmus,
then mister Twister.

21:45.885 --> 21:47.720
Now, Santa Prisca.

21:47.787 --> 21:51.724
- Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

21:51.791 --> 21:54.560
But 3 times is enemy action,

21:54.627 --> 21:58.797
And enemies of the light
must not stand.
