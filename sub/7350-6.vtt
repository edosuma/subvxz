WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:07.741
*

00:19.853 --> 00:21.589
Say one word,

00:21.622 --> 00:23.624
it's your last.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.295
Is that a knife
in my back, Eric,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.330
or are you just
happy to see me?

00:32.666 --> 00:35.736
I told you it was too much
cologne before we left
the hotel.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.740
We're in New Orleans

00:39.773 --> 00:42.576
during one of the spookiest
weeks of the year.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.613
What do you say
we do something deviant?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.781
Like the sound
of "deviant."

00:57.291 --> 00:58.692
Here?
Yeah.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.834
Whoa.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.704
WOMAN: Do you think
she's passed out?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.341
Hey...

01:13.374 --> 01:14.508
lady...

01:14.542 --> 01:16.377
you, uh...

01:16.410 --> 01:19.713
you all right?

01:19.747 --> 01:22.716
:
Help me.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.586
Devil...

01:25.619 --> 01:28.256
did th

01:32.726 --> 01:35.529
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.563 --> 01:38.132
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:38.166 --> 01:40.701
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:40.734 --> 01:41.669
* How, how, how, how

01:41.702 --> 01:44.172
* Hey, hey

01:49.877 --> 01:51.445
* You gotta come on.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.584
Morning, Brody.
Morning.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.752
Got you some witch's brew
for Hallow's Eve.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.388
Thank you.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.723
Pumpkin spice lattÃ©.
Whoo, I love

02:02.756 --> 02:04.292
this time of year.
Hm.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.626
Wait'll you see

02:05.659 --> 02:06.827
what I got in here.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.930
What

02:09.963 --> 02:12.633
You got a giant omelet
to go with that?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.835
The bacon's not to eat,

02:14.868 --> 02:15.803
it's my costume.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.405
The Baconator.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.806
Half bacon...

02:18.839 --> 02:20.841
half Terminator.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.644
:
I'll be back fat.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.546
: That is...
the dumbest costume

02:25.579 --> 02:27.481
I have ever seen
in my life.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.218
I'll take that as a compliment.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.852
Got to understand
something.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.821
In New Orleans,
we don't celebrate Halloween,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.823
we celebrate Halloweek.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.559
We got the Boo at the Zoo,
Bloody Mary's Haunted Tours,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.394
and I'm headed to Voodoo
Fest tomorrow night.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.829
It's a way of life down here.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.833
Lasalle here.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.570
Yeah, I'm on it.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.373
Got a dead Navy judge
in a cemetery.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.874
Isn't that normal?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.909
Not outside the tomb.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.514
PRIDE:
Morning, Loretta.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.750
WADE: Gives a whole new meaning
to "graveyard shift," right?

03:02.783 --> 03:05.753
:
'Tis the season to be spooky.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.288
What do we have?

03:07.321 --> 03:12.360
We have Naval Staff Judge
Advocate Melanie Herman.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.797
Melanie?

03:16.830 --> 03:17.831
You knew her?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.967
Yeah, we brought a...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.902
host of...

03:21.935 --> 03:24.538
cases through her courtroom
over the years.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.874
Good as it gets
with a gavel.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.512
Last time I saw her,
she was a blonde.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.481
WADE: The color's recent--
there's still some dye

03:33.514 --> 03:34.782
on the back of her neck.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.517
Time of death?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.985
Few minutes
before 3:00 a.m.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.488
It's confirmed
by the couple over there.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.923
There's no dependent lividity
in the extremities,

03:42.956 --> 03:45.759
which suggests
significant blood loss.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.760
She bled out?

03:46.794 --> 03:47.961
LASALLE:
No blood

03:47.995 --> 03:49.963
found on or
around the body.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.633
Killer must have cleaned her,
then dumped her.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.802
Are you ready
for the kicker?

03:54.835 --> 03:59.307
Two small puncture wounds
near her jugular vein.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.515
So we got a dead woman
in a Victorian dress...

04:07.548 --> 04:10.017
significant blood loss,
with two...

04:11.719 --> 04:13.754
...bite marks
on the side of her neck?

04:15.022 --> 04:16.990
Happy Halloween, Dwayne.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.574
Judge Melody Herman.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.578
Got her start in the Navy in the
Judge Advocate General Corps

04:37.611 --> 04:40.614
before being bumped off the
bench about 15 years ago.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.816
Married and divorced.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.953
One son-- junior at TCU.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.456
Catwoman and Skeletor said
they came across the body,

04:48.489 --> 04:49.690
thought she was passed out.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.359
Last words were:

04:51.392 --> 04:52.926
"Devil did this."

04:52.960 --> 04:55.696
So the first thing
we need to do is to rule out

04:55.729 --> 04:58.366
the random mugging,
burglary and assault.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.700
Start digging
into her judicial history,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.702
see if there's
someone she convicted

05:01.735 --> 05:04.405
with issues.
And the vampire angle?

05:04.438 --> 05:07.375
If Judge Herman had
someone in her courtroom

05:07.408 --> 05:09.610
whose reflection doesn't
show up in a mirror,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.479
they're suspect
number one.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.481
Short of that,
let's assume this monster

05:13.514 --> 05:15.483
is from the human race.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.617
LINDA:
Hey.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.521
Linda.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.724
Came by to drop off
Halloween decorations

05:23.757 --> 05:24.958
from the attic.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.927
Chris.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.961
How you doing, Linda?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.863
And you must be Agent Brody.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.633
Mary. Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Pride.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.636
Mrs. Pride is
my mother-in-law, who...

05:35.669 --> 05:37.405
for the record,
I am very fond of.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.039
Call me Linda.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.874
So, we'll head over
to Judge Herman's office,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.776
talk to her Legalman.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.578
Take a look at all her cases.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.447
Please.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.450
You could've just

05:49.483 --> 05:52.085
brought these over...
tomorrow, you know,

05:52.119 --> 05:53.887
on-on Halloween.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.689
I'm not coming
tomorrow.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.959
It's tradition.

05:58.992 --> 06:03.397
We're not exactly in tradition
mode right now, are we?

06:03.431 --> 06:04.832
No, I... I know that,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.700
but I... I just thought

06:06.734 --> 06:09.637
a... bunch of kids
dressed as ghosts

06:09.670 --> 06:12.740
and a nice chocolate high
might lead to something fun.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.108
I'm sure it would.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.079
But that's exactly why
it's a bad idea.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.048
And... why I made

06:21.081 --> 06:23.617
other plans.
Other plans?

06:23.651 --> 06:27.087
I don't want to make it worse
by falling into old habits.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.926
Hang on just...

06:37.898 --> 06:39.767
Let me guess.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.868
You have to go.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.770
Sorry.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.908
Enjoy your chocolate high.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.818
MAN:
You work with someone...

06:57.851 --> 07:01.755
see them every day,
for ten years...

07:01.789 --> 07:05.192
:
and then they're just gone.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.628
Any idea who did it?

07:07.661 --> 07:08.696
That's why we're here.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.831
Has she received
any threats lately?

07:10.864 --> 07:13.100
Well, course
there were threats.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.670
Judge Herman put people behind
bars for a living, but...

07:16.704 --> 07:18.972
there was nothing either
of us considered serious.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.175
That said, I can put
together a list of all
of her cases for you.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.211
Know where she went
after work last night?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.746
Let me look at her schedule.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.552
I RSVP'd for her to attend
a private retirement party

07:31.585 --> 07:34.121
at Galatoire's
for Councilman Reilly.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.690
Could be the last-known
whereabouts before her murder.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.560
Do you know if she
actually attended the party?
I don't.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.029
But I'll give you the name
of the event's host.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.733
How much do you know
about Dracula?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.501
The Dracula,

07:47.535 --> 07:49.870
or someone from the Garden
District named Bruce Dracula?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.972
Bruce Dracula
would be super cool.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.742
No. I'm talking about
Count Vladislaus Dracula.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.778
I'm a bit of a horror nut.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.248
Big shocker, I know.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.851
And I'm not talking about
that Twihard trash, either.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.252
I'm talking
about the classics, okay?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.987
Stephen King,
New Orleans' own Anne Rice.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.822
Before that, H.P. Lovecraft.
Algernon Blackwood.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.824
Back to the judge, please.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.960
Right. Sorry.
So Loretta is still in autopsy,

08:12.993 --> 08:15.829
but think about it--
two puncture wounds on the neck,

08:15.863 --> 08:17.297
handmade Victorian dress,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.099
hair dyed red-- this...
look at this.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.135
This is what Judge
Herman looked like

08:22.169 --> 08:23.637
when she was discovered.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.838
And this...

08:24.872 --> 08:27.074
is an artistic
rendering

08:27.107 --> 08:28.175
of Lucy Westenra,

08:28.208 --> 08:29.309
Dracula's first victim

08:29.342 --> 08:30.844
from Bram Stoker's novel.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.146
Similar.
It's a dead ringer.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.115
That is not
the best choice of words.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.952
Okay, so Judge Herman did
a good job with her costume.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.855
I don't think she
had anything to do
with her costume.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.090
Step into my parlor,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.559
said the spider to the fly.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.564
The bite mark on the judge's
neck are superficial,

08:50.598 --> 08:52.566
less than two
millimeters deep.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.902
Which means it's not able
to reach the jugular vein,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.605
so tha is not the source
of the blood loss.

08:57.638 --> 09:01.642
I also swabbed
for foreign organic matter.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.043
Came up with nothing.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.612
So... not bites.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.880
My guess is the
tip of a knife.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.215
Just for show?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.983
WADE:
That's correct. Now...

09:10.017 --> 09:11.919
the real source
of the blood loss--

09:11.952 --> 09:15.956
an incision on the
side of the judge...

09:16.957 --> 09:18.759
...near her lower back...

09:19.993 --> 09:21.829
...right here.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.934
And this cut is not something
done in a hospital.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.936
There is no evidence

09:28.969 --> 09:32.072
of any surgical expertise.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.907
It's all very crude.

09:33.941 --> 09:37.845
Also, chloroform found
in her bloodstream,

09:37.878 --> 09:40.280
which means she was most
likely unconscious.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.150
Thank God.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.618
But still...

09:44.652 --> 09:45.285
What is...

09:45.318 --> 09:47.387
Hold that question, Dwayne.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.692
After the incision,
the site was sewn up,

09:51.725 --> 09:54.862
using this
silk-braided thread

09:54.895 --> 09:58.832
as a makeshift suture,
and this thread...

09:58.866 --> 10:01.635
Is identical to the hem on the
dress that she was found in.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.036
Right.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.407
PRIDE:
Wait, the killer

10:07.440 --> 10:10.978
drugged her, cut her open,

10:11.011 --> 10:13.714
takes a thread
from this dress,

10:13.747 --> 10:16.984
and sews up her wound,
then redresses her

10:17.017 --> 10:19.286
to look like Lucy Westenra
from Dracula?

10:19.319 --> 10:21.354
'S cool.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.024
In a sick, plotty kind of way.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.826
Now can I ask that question?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.194
Yes, Dwayne, now's the time.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.996
What's the incision for?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.097
Killer stole her kidney.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.165
Her what?

10:32.199 --> 10:34.134
WADE:
Kidney.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.936
Removed her kidney.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.039
All right...

10:39.072 --> 10:41.008
Horror Guy...

10:41.041 --> 10:43.711
anything about Dracula
being a kidney thief?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.879
Nope. Total loss.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.281
That makes two of us.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.684
What are we looking at here,
organ harvesting?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.385
Seems more personal
than that.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.387
No need to do the costume bit

10:54.421 --> 10:58.091
if what you're looking for is a
quick buck on the black market.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.427
Herman's Legalman
tell you anything?
Just a stack

11:00.460 --> 11:02.229
of case files--
which I'm gonna go through,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.231
see if anyone's capable
of this kind of butchery.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.767
Dern also gave us
the judge's possible
last known whereabouts--

11:06.800 --> 11:08.468
party at Galatoire's.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.137
Get the guest list,
talk to staff?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.404
Tried to,
but the owner

11:11.438 --> 11:13.073
is stonewalling us.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.374
Host didn't want
any information released.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.442
We're getting a subpoena.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.977
No time for a subpoena.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.379
Go straight to the host.
Yeah, King?

11:19.412 --> 11:20.981
The host...

11:21.014 --> 11:24.117
he's not your biggest fan.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.956
Councilman Hamilton.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.323
Dwayne!

11:30.357 --> 11:33.961
Will you excuse me, please?
Sure, no problem.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.429
So, to what do
I owe this honor?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.932
You stonewalled my agents
from getting a guest list

11:38.966 --> 11:40.433
that they requested.
Ah.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.103
If this is about you
not receiving an
invite to my soiree,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.873
I suggest next time you just
have your wife call, since...

11:45.906 --> 11:48.008
she's the one who's
got all the charm.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.011
Don't think charm is required
in a murder investigation.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.814
Is this another one
of your wild theories?

11:53.847 --> 11:57.050
I mean, are you suggesting again
that I... I've had a hand

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
in whatever happened
to your victim?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.754
I'm suggesting

12:00.788 --> 12:04.224
you protect yourself from
potential obstruction charges.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.327
Be a shame to...

12:07.360 --> 12:10.798
have to cuff your ass in front
of all these registered voters.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.405
I'll call Galatoire's, have them
offer up whatever you like.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.407
Okay. Wise move.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.077
As you like to say...
"Have a blessed day."

12:31.118 --> 12:33.286
Whoa, whoa, what
do we have here?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.789
Galatoire's sent
a little snack

12:35.823 --> 12:38.826
along with the guest list
and security footage.

12:38.859 --> 12:42.095
Oysters?
And you didn't save me any?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.097
I did save you some ice.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.400
Did you find anything
in Dern's files?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.302
No organ thieves,
and no one

12:49.336 --> 12:51.271
with any special
surgical expertise.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.041
No one on dialysis
in need of a kidney.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.909
Just 200 convicts
who hated Judge Herman.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.078
Because they're
all innocent?
Yep.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.247
And you?
Well, nothing obvious

13:00.280 --> 13:02.315
from the guest list--
but check this out.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.583
Cameras caught the judge

13:03.616 --> 13:06.419
leaving the restaurant
around 9:15.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.522
She leave alone?
Well, she left alone,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.458
but it didn't stay like that
for long.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.393
Tapped into
various French Quarter cameras

13:13.426 --> 13:15.095
leading away from Galatoire's.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.396
Followed her path,

13:16.429 --> 13:18.098
and after looking at
several different angles,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.000
I noticed the same man

13:20.033 --> 13:22.502
trailing her:

13:22.535 --> 13:23.703
Petty Officer Jake Dern.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.007
Huh. I thought he said,
"I don't know if she attended."

13:27.040 --> 13:30.410
Did he approach her,
try to grab her?
There's no way to tell.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.545
Cameras cut out in
the next block and I lost him,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.414
but he definitely knew
where she was.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.149
Jake Dern.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.886
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.555
Petty Officer Dern!

13:42.589 --> 13:44.191
You're home
from work early.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.458
LASALLE: We tried
calling your office

13:45.492 --> 13:47.460
multiple times--
you can't return our calls?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.296
Hate to think you've
been avoiding us.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.932
Was there a...
a problem with the files?

13:51.965 --> 13:52.966
The files were fine.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.035
Your recent whereabouts,
not so much.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.870
What's this?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.072
That's you
following Judge Herman.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.209
BRODY: There she is-- and look,
the judge is always

14:02.242 --> 14:03.543
just ahead of you.
Really?

14:03.576 --> 14:05.045
I had no idea.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.413
For eight blocks?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.882
I was just on my way home.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.884
It's a crowded street.
You know more

14:10.918 --> 14:12.485
than anyone
that won't hold up in court.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.628
I didn't kill her.
LASALLE: Then why
didn't you tell us

14:21.661 --> 14:24.331
everything you knew
when we were being friendly?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.535
You had a thing for her.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.071
She wasn't into
you, was she?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.240
That made you angry.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.042
Rage-ful.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.610
Enough to make you
want to lash out.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.149
Yes, I...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.551
I... followed her.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.954
Just wanted to see
if she was going

14:46.987 --> 14:48.621
to meet someone
after the party.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.390
But then she turned around.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.626
Almost saw me, near the corner
of Royal and Dumaine.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.463
I hid, and she
went... east.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.531
Then I went to Patty's
and drank

14:58.565 --> 15:01.134
for the rest of the night.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.003
This is where Dern
lost Judge Herman.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.672
If we believe his story.
I called over
at Patty's.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.541
They said Dern was there,
just like he told us.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.679
No cameras.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.482
Halloween is everywhere,
isn't it?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.651
Hey, come on, you
go green face,

15:18.685 --> 15:21.989
put on Kevlar-- you're the
Wicked Witch of the Vest.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.191
Over my dead body.
That's the spirit.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.162
It's probably not a coincidence
this is happening on Halloween.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.164
A crime like this'll
get extra attention.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.066
It just got mine.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.536
This remind you
of anyone?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.571
Judge Herman.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.636
BRODY:
Blood.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.682
Brody...

16:35.195 --> 16:37.364
I'll call Wade.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.066
I'll call Pride.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.380
Sebastian ran your victim's
fingerprints against

16:53.413 --> 16:55.182
military records.

16:55.215 --> 16:59.186
He is Lieutenant Commander
Joel Abram, naval aviator.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.488
Assigned to VR-44.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.556
And from what I can tell,
uh, based on rigor mortis,

17:03.590 --> 17:05.325
he's been dead
at least three days.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.094
And...

17:07.127 --> 17:10.497
he's definitely related
to your judge case.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.698
How do you know?

17:11.731 --> 17:12.832
Ask me.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.701
Trick or treat.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.735
Sorry?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.104
Choose trick,

17:17.137 --> 17:18.705
'cause it's a good one.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.074
Trick?

17:21.108 --> 17:24.377
Abrams has
a similar incision to the judge

17:24.411 --> 17:28.348
on the side, and when
I investigated the wound,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.083
I found...

17:30.117 --> 17:32.852
human beings are born
with two kidneys.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.722
This one had a third.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.757
Clearly placed
inside the body postmortem.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.426
I ran tissue tests

17:39.459 --> 17:41.761
on the one that
shouldn't be there.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.365
You want to guess who
the wayward kidney belongs to?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.167
Judge Melanie Herman?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.669
Told you it'd be a good trick.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.143
BRODY: It's just twisted.
Killer plays dress-up

17:56.176 --> 17:59.112
with one corpse, hides the
kidney with the other?

17:59.146 --> 18:02.182
And as far as we know,
they don't seem to have...

18:02.215 --> 18:04.117
run across each other
in the service,

18:04.151 --> 18:06.119
or personally,
or anywhere.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.121
But they did in
the courtroom.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.623
Abram was a jury member on
a military court-martial

18:10.657 --> 18:12.292
that Judge Herman
presided over.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.794
What was the case?
Sexual assault.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.197
Victim was a woman
named Denise Murdock.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.167
Defendant was... Chief
Petty Officer John Neville--

18:20.200 --> 18:23.703
sentenced to seven years
in the Charleston Naval Brig.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.838
Neville always maintained
his innocence.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.241
Appealed numerous times,
his lawyer claiming

18:28.275 --> 18:30.710
evidence tampering
and witness coercion.
And...

18:30.743 --> 18:32.379
he was released
three months ago.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.547
So it wasn't "Devil did this."

18:34.581 --> 18:37.184
It was "Neville did this."

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
If it was him...

18:38.751 --> 18:41.388
he's already killed
the judge and a juror.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.590
We can't be sure who's next,

18:43.623 --> 18:46.259
but we got to be
especially concerned about...

18:46.293 --> 18:49.629
The victim in the case--
Denise Murdock.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.265
If she's still alive,

18:52.299 --> 18:55.735
we got to find her
before Neville does.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.171
My baby girl.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.574
I called her cell,
it went straight to voice mail.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.243
I went to her apartment.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.778
Her cat was there,
all alone, no water.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.348
When was the last time
you talked to her?
Two days ago.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.250
This just can't be happening.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.684
She's already been through

19:11.718 --> 19:13.920
so much, Agent Pride.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.955
I don't know what I'd do,
if this time...
We're going

19:15.988 --> 19:19.192
to do everything we
can in our power to
find her, Ms. Murdock.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.561
Thank you.
Yeah.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.834
Will you give
me a moment?
Yeah.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.972
Got John Neville's address--
outside of town, 20 minutes.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.941
BOLO on Denise's
car got a hit.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.175
But no Denise?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.846
Drop Mrs. Murdock off

19:39.879 --> 19:41.881
at the office,
then follow up

19:41.914 --> 19:44.251
on the BOLO.
Brody, you're with me.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.989
This here is
private property.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.626
This is where I show you
the badge, Mr. Neville.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.994
NCIS.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.897
I got nothing to say
to you people.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.666
You're on
parole, John.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.335
You're gonna talk whether
you want to or not.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.670
About what?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.538
I'm on the straight and narrow.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.340
Besides...

20:07.374 --> 20:09.709
you're not my parole officer.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.411
We can drag him down
here, if you want to.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.913
Or you can just tell
me where you were
two nights ago.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.715
None of your damn business.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.419
A dead judge and a juror from
your trial make it our business.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.255
You go to hell.
Now, hey, easy, easy, Pa.

20:22.289 --> 20:25.024
No, no, no.
These sons of bitches...

20:25.057 --> 20:27.694
they're here to frame me again.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.597
I already had my wife leave.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.699
I lost my retirement!

20:32.732 --> 20:35.368
I'm innocent, you bastard.
Hey, take it easy, Pa.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.370
Back off, half-wit!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.038
I think you
should listen

20:39.071 --> 20:40.573
to your son there, John.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.009
Good advice.
I didn't kill no one.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.912
Like... I didn't assault
that girl.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.648
So unless you got evidence
that says I did,

20:48.681 --> 20:51.050
get the hell off my property.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.985
Now.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.863
Charmer.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.798
LASALLE: This is Denise
Murdock's vehicle, right?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.968
Yeah. Looks like the car
was run off the road.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.338
And there are signs
of a struggle.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.341
Driver's-side window, smashed.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.716
Looks like blood here.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.959
What's this white stuff?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.361
Don't know.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.902
You wouldn't want
two tickets to Voodoo Fest,

21:42.935 --> 21:44.471
would you, Officer Sullos?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.472
Why?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.806
Looks like it's gonna be

21:46.839 --> 21:48.475
a long night.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.479
Just got an e-mail
from a Dr. Wilkins,

21:52.512 --> 21:54.447
former staff psychologist

21:54.481 --> 21:56.483
at Charleston during the
time Neville was there.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.351
He's already on a commuter
flight, be here in 30.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.452
Good.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.655
I'll go check in on Mrs.
Murdock, see how she's do...

22:03.856 --> 22:05.658
You find the girl?

22:07.026 --> 22:09.429
I found another box
of decorations,

22:09.462 --> 22:13.366
and came by to
give them to you.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.502
I... saw Mrs. Murdock.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.405
She's scared to death.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.474
She has reason to be.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.543
Thanks for staying with her.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.513
I know you got to go.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.448
I'm not going anywhere.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.118
Not until her daughter's found.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.086
How many times over the years

22:34.120 --> 22:36.022
have you sat with a
terrified family member,

22:36.055 --> 22:37.156
kept them calm?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.826
Another tradition.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.494
BRODY:
Pride.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.363
Loretta needs to see you.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.067
Go. Learn things.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.707
He got that from you?

22:55.742 --> 22:58.478
Damn straight.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.112
Loretta.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.582
I got two dead bodies
and a missing girl.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.716
Need something good.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.051
Oh, it's good.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.419
Says the horror fanatic.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.720
So...

23:07.754 --> 23:09.188
we have Lieutenant
Commander Abram.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.725
Like the judge, we found
chloroform in the bloodstream,

23:12.759 --> 23:15.695
but instead of
bite marks, we have...

23:15.728 --> 23:16.963
burn marks.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.598
Tissue suggests

23:18.631 --> 23:22.469
an electronic charge
made directly on the skin.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.637
Killer used a stun gun
to subdue Abram.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.473
WADE:
I agree. But it doesn't explain

23:26.506 --> 23:29.008
the burn marks
on the right side of the neck.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.048
Why would anyone stun
a dead body?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.517
Call on me.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.453
Okay, so, if Judge Herman

23:40.487 --> 23:43.122
was Lucy from Dracula,
Lieutenant Commander Abram

23:43.155 --> 23:45.525
is Frankenstein's monster.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.926
Really?

23:46.959 --> 23:48.661
I read mostly nonfiction.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.698
We have a dead body with an
organ placed inside of it.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.666
That organ came from
another dead body

23:53.700 --> 23:55.802
in a cemetery, which
is precisely where
Victor Frankenstein

23:55.835 --> 23:57.704
got his spare parts
to make his monster,

23:57.737 --> 23:59.906
and the burn marks from
the stun gun are...

23:59.939 --> 24:02.208
The killer's
symbolic attempt to...

24:02.241 --> 24:04.711
bring the body back to life?

24:04.744 --> 24:06.879
Using electricity.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.685
John Neville used to sit
in my office and rant

24:12.719 --> 24:15.822
about how he'd
been wronged.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.189
Perks of the job.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.191
Guy had a temper,
he's a dark soul.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.594
Used to routinely get into it
with inmates and guards,

24:21.628 --> 24:24.263
and then get sent to me,
and I'd have to listen

24:24.296 --> 24:26.265
to his twisted fantasies.
He was into horror?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.000
Oh, read it
all the time.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.904
And not the subtle stuff--
pulp, underground novels.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.841
I brought a list of
what we found when
he was released.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.643
Thank you.
Yeah.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.579
Lasalle, this is
Dr. Samuel Wilkins.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.582
When Agent
Brody called,

24:42.615 --> 24:44.684
said John Neville was back
on the radar, got here

24:44.717 --> 24:46.218
as fast as I could.
Appreciate it.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.588
Any update on what you found
in Denise's car?

24:48.621 --> 24:50.557
Waiting on a match
of the blood spatter,

24:50.590 --> 24:53.626
but analysis on
the white substance says gypsum.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.629
Forgive the forensically
challenged, but gypsum?

24:56.663 --> 24:58.831
It's what they use
to make plaster or drywall.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.834
Okay.
Chainsaw Christmas.
Up to Snuff.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.970
This is all pretty
grisly material.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.773
Yeah. You won't find that in
Oprah's Book-of-the-Month club.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.776
You're in Oprah's book club?
She's actually got
pretty decent taste.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.143
Wait, there's
a horror anthology here--

25:11.177 --> 25:12.812
three stories,
and the first two,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.814
Dracula and Frankenstein,
match the M.O.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.083
of our first two victims.
Well, what's the third?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.885
Edgar Allen Poe's
"Cask of Amontillado."

25:18.918 --> 25:21.020
Any chance Oprah recommended
that one to you?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.255
No. But my English Lit
professor did.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.692
Revenge tale-- the
villain, Montressor,

25:25.725 --> 25:27.326
feels so wronged
by his enemy, Fortunato,

25:27.359 --> 25:29.662
that he imprisons him
in chains in his cellar,

25:29.696 --> 25:30.830
leaving him to starve,

25:30.863 --> 25:32.899
and then he builds a wall

25:32.932 --> 25:34.133
around him.
Drywall.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.968
Means we got something

25:36.002 --> 25:39.171
on John Neville.
Means Denise may still be alive.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.590
*

26:04.196 --> 26:05.598
NCIS!

26:05.632 --> 26:07.233
Huh?
Hands in the air, Jesse.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.870
Where's your father?
I-I don't know.

26:10.903 --> 26:11.904
Clear.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.239
Clear.
BRODY: Stand up.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.007
Turn around.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.676
Put your hands
over your head.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.745
Interlace your fingers
behind your neck.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.261
You're under arrest,
you sick bastard.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.198
Come on, get up.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.701
Where is she?
Where's Denise Murdock?

26:41.734 --> 26:42.969
How the hell should I know!

26:43.002 --> 26:44.036
Get him out of here.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.104
And then find her.
Come on!

26:45.137 --> 26:46.873
Tear this place apart.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.386
LASALLE :
Denise Murdock?

27:03.322 --> 27:06.993
What's this?
Pa-Pa's stuff, for his
condition-- he needs that.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.795
Get him out of here.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.997
Please, anything bad happens,
he'll blame me, I know it.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.833
He don't need to be here.
Please...

27:37.023 --> 27:38.357
Got anything?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.695
Nothing.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.216
BRODY:
Pride.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.251
What's up there?

28:08.487 --> 28:11.791
Bloody knife you used to cut out
your victims' kidneys.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.328
Stun gun you used to recreate
Frankenstein's monster.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.267
Denise Murdock's driver's
license and credit cards,

28:21.300 --> 28:23.335
all found in the crawlspace
above your bedroom.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.307
Talk to us.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.347
Maybe I got a raccoon.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.149
They're known

28:37.183 --> 28:39.285
to collect things.

28:45.324 --> 28:49.095
Raccoons put your blood
in Denise's car?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.534
Where is she, John?

28:55.567 --> 28:59.972
Saving the girl may be the only
thing that spares your life.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.544
My life is over.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.414
So is hers.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.820
LINDA:
So she's dead?

29:15.021 --> 29:17.256
If you believe John Neville.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.860
You don't.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.096
Evidence lines up.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.267
But...?

29:29.301 --> 29:31.437
She's alive.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.505
Somewhere.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.146
Speak.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.120
I fell in love with you
because of your hunches, Dwayne.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.533
Hands.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.305
Lasalle found blood
in Denise's car--

30:06.338 --> 30:09.108
Neville's blood-- but Neville
doesn't have any cuts.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.978
On his hands,
on his arms.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.013
Anywhere.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.486
LASALLE: You're sure the blood's
a match for John Neville?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.321
100% sure. 110%.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.056
Infinity percent, actually.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.358
BRODY: So if it's a match,
he's telling the truth--

30:26.392 --> 30:28.127
he's the killer.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.528
Well, that percentage
is a lot lower.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.897
In fact,
I don't think John Neville

30:30.930 --> 30:32.031
was anywhere near that car.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.400
Now... if he
cut himself

30:34.433 --> 30:36.135
on the broken glass
two days ago,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.170
that might have been enough time
for the skin to heal,

30:38.204 --> 30:40.239
depending on the severity of
the wound-- but I kept looking

30:40.272 --> 30:42.241
at those photos that you took
of the blood spatter.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.609
Something wasn't
sitting right.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.144
Something other than... me.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.545
On account of this
rash that I have

30:46.578 --> 30:48.580
On account of this
late fall heat...
BOTH: Sebastian.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.283
By sharing, we grow closer.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.919
Anyway...

30:52.952 --> 30:54.921
I ran 40 different
simulations,

30:54.954 --> 30:56.522
trying figure out
if the blood got there

30:56.555 --> 30:58.224
from punching in
the window

30:58.257 --> 30:59.959
or maybe some kind of
struggle with Denise,

30:59.992 --> 31:01.460
even if they were
doing the tango,

31:01.493 --> 31:04.163
and none of them matches
the pattern that you found.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.331
All of these blood spots

31:05.364 --> 31:07.566
are too perfect,
as if they were...

31:07.599 --> 31:10.636
Planted. But how did someone
get access to Neville's blood?

31:10.669 --> 31:14.306
Hemochromatosis.
I hope you're not talking
about your rash again.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.475
It's a condition in which
there's an abnormal accumulation

31:16.508 --> 31:18.644
of iron
in the parenchymal organs.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.412
The only way to bring it
down to safe levels

31:20.446 --> 31:23.415
is by regularly removing blood
from your body, and...

31:23.449 --> 31:24.951
John Neville's got it.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.152
His son Jesse panicked

31:26.185 --> 31:27.486
when I found the
medical equipment.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.493
Wh-Why would I...

31:34.526 --> 31:37.896
why would I put Pa's blood
in

31:39.398 --> 31:42.101
Don't know.

31:43.535 --> 31:47.039
But we found the medical
equipment at your house.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.142
You had access on account
of his condition.

31:51.577 --> 31:55.347
Have you
I-I got a headache.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.549
BRODY :
Maybe it's your conscience
telling you to come clean.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.051
JESSE: Look, I swear
I don't know nothing

31:59.085 --> 32:01.520
about that girl.
You also swear
you didn't send

32:01.553 --> 32:03.222
that anthology to your father?

32:03.255 --> 32:07.259
You knew how much
he loved horror.

32:07.293 --> 32:10.596
You wanted to make sure
it was in his possession?

32:10.629 --> 32:13.132
Checked your father's
prison delivery manifest.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.400
You sent the book.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.567
You could have put
those items

32:15.601 --> 32:18.037
in the attic
of the house.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.172
Why

32:21.173 --> 32:24.143
He destroyed your family.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.546
My head...

32:27.579 --> 32:29.615
my head, it...
Jesse.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.317
Please, please, I...

32:31.350 --> 32:33.285
I-I'll do whatever you want.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.455
I'll... I'll take
one of them lie tests, anything.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.529
Wait.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.997
He passed?

32:45.031 --> 32:47.066
Every answer, rock solid.

32:47.099 --> 32:50.169
Don't know how,
but he's telling the truth.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.670
Or...

32:51.703 --> 32:53.605
he think he is.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.441
Jekyll and Hyde.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.545
DPD-- Dissociative
Personality Disorder--

32:59.578 --> 33:01.547
which often manifests
as a result

33:01.580 --> 33:03.515
of abuse during
childhood development.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.384
When that happens,
an alternate personality

33:05.417 --> 33:08.487
develops to shield
the abused from harm.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.257
Two personalities--
and the primary

33:11.290 --> 33:13.359
you've been talking
to-- Dr. Jekyll--

33:13.392 --> 33:15.661
is completely unaware of
what Mr. Hyde has done.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.563
How he passed
the lie detector test.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.697
So...

33:18.730 --> 33:20.166
Denise Murdock...

33:20.199 --> 33:23.102
if we have any hope
of finding her alive...

33:23.135 --> 33:24.536
You've talked
to Jekyll.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.573
Now you need to get
to Mr. Hyde.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.675
Question is...

33:29.708 --> 33:31.777
how do we do that?

33:42.321 --> 33:44.256
JESSE :
Can I go home now?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.325
BRODY :
Just a few more questions.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.560
JESSE:
I don't know anything about...

33:48.594 --> 33:50.696
those people or-or that girl.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.298
BRODY:
I believe you.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.399
Pa don't either.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.633
I believe him, too.

33:58.304 --> 34:01.407
City's like a sauna
out there, huh?

34:02.408 --> 34:04.476
Hm?
So?

34:04.510 --> 34:07.313
Well, just every time
I see you, you've got this...

34:07.346 --> 34:09.248
long-sleeve shirt on.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.782
Your father do this to you?

34:10.816 --> 34:13.785
I want to go home.
And you can.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.523
As soon as I can talk
to the person

34:17.556 --> 34:19.458
who knows where
Denise Murdock is.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.692
I told you, I don't...

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
I know what
you told me,

34:22.461 --> 34:26.332
but there is a girl out there
dying... somewhere.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.534
Look...

34:28.567 --> 34:31.170
I'm your friend, okay?

34:31.203 --> 34:33.239
You got to talk to me.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.840
And if I don't?

34:34.873 --> 34:38.177
You don't want to know.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.382
You sure about this?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.785
If a Hyde personality exists
and if he's protecting Jesse,

34:46.818 --> 34:49.855
only way to bring him out
is to make the alternate believe

34:49.888 --> 34:51.457
you're going to hurt
the primary.

34:51.490 --> 34:52.824
PRIDE:
You lied to us.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.893
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.596
No.
And I got a girl
dying out there.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.467
And I swear to you...

35:01.500 --> 35:04.403
you don't tell me
what I need to know,

35:04.436 --> 35:06.805
what your father did
to your arms there,

35:06.838 --> 35:10.242
child's play compared
to what I'm gonna do.
Stop.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.511
Is that what you want?
Do you want me to hurt you
Please-please...

35:12.544 --> 35:14.380
like your father did?
'Cause I'm willing
BRODY: Pride.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.482
to do whatever it takes
to save that girl.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.350
I don't know anything.
Yes, you do.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.852
No, I don't.
Yes, you know!

35:20.886 --> 35:23.189
Time's up, you half-wit.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.591
You think about burning Jesse,
you're gonna wish you

35:25.624 --> 35:27.659
got off as easy as
the judge and Abram!

35:45.644 --> 35:49.281
Big man needs a little girl
to come to the rescue.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.183
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hyde.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.752
Shall we take
that lie detector test again?

35:53.785 --> 35:56.322
You killed

35:56.355 --> 35:57.823
Judge Herman
and Lieutenant Commander Abrams

35:57.856 --> 35:59.491
because you wanted
to put Jesse's father

35:59.525 --> 36:01.793
back in prison where he
wouldn't hurt Jesse again.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.632
But Denise is a victim
just like Jesse is.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.501
Denise was more than that.

36:12.371 --> 36:15.207
She was the first chapter.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.811
You...

36:19.845 --> 36:21.647
assaulted her

36:21.680 --> 36:22.814
back then.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.351
You framed

36:25.384 --> 36:27.553
Jesse's father...

36:27.586 --> 36:30.656
and had him put away
the first time.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.325
Only for seven years.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.861
And if that judge

36:35.894 --> 36:38.297
had just given cruel,

36:38.330 --> 36:41.700
cruel John the maximum...

36:43.502 --> 36:46.838
...no one else
would have gotten hurt.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.977
And you know
who's gonna get hurt now...

36:52.010 --> 36:53.712
is Jesse...

36:53.745 --> 36:56.615
if he goes to that
maximum security prison.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.817
And that's what's gonna happen

36:58.850 --> 37:01.587
if you don't tell us
where Denise is.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.755
But cooperate,

37:03.789 --> 37:06.292
help us find her alive,

37:06.325 --> 37:10.629
we might be able to get Jesse to
a place where he can get help.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.336
Why not?

37:20.406 --> 37:22.941
You're probably
too late, anyway.

37:28.046 --> 37:30.248
Pride, in here!

37:31.717 --> 37:34.620
4010?
Yep.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.622
Hold that lock.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.631
Fortunato was buried
in a cellar.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.535
New nails
in that piece of plywood.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.637
Get the crowbar.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.049
She's here.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.589
PRIDE:
Denise.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.990
Got a pulse.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.733
Baby, it's Mommy.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.735
Okay. It's okay.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.638
Is Denise gonna
be okay?

38:26.672 --> 38:30.108
Paramedics say she's
suffering from dehydration.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.611
But she'll recover.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.046
Appreciate you
bringing Mrs. Murdock.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.849
It was the least
I could do.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.822
I know I've been hard on
you, hard on your job.

38:43.855 --> 38:47.693
But it's not really
about the amount of work,

38:47.726 --> 38:49.995
it's about the kind of work.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.898
Every case
that you've had

38:52.931 --> 38:55.601
has made me think...

38:57.669 --> 39:00.706
...what if the missing
girl was Laurel?

39:02.541 --> 39:05.577
What if the dead
guy were Dwayne?

39:07.446 --> 39:10.382
I'm not afraid of
ghosts or goblins.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.917
What scares the
crap out of me

39:11.950 --> 39:14.720
is the idea that your
work might come home.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.393
Y

39:22.728 --> 39:25.931
Is the idea
that my work...

39:25.964 --> 39:30.035
might be the reason that
I don't get to come home.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.746
You should go.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.616
What about that
trick

39:44.650 --> 39:47.152
Always next year.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.834
You're a good man, Mr. Pride.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.538
Don't you ever forget it,
Mrs. Pride.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.622
*

40:34.866 --> 40:37.135
Ah...
One crack,

40:37.168 --> 40:40.005
and I'll put another crack
in your skull.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.740
It's good to see you
get in the spirit.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.742
When in Rome, right?

40:43.775 --> 40:46.845
Any, uh, any guesses?

40:46.878 --> 40:47.979
WILKINS:
Freudian slip.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.549
Cigar's a nice touch.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.885
Most people don't know
that Freud preferred
them to pipes.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.823
Love a woman who pays
attention to detail.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.558
:
I need your clothes,

40:59.591 --> 41:02.628
your motorcycle,
and some bacon, too.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.763
Is he always like this?

41:04.796 --> 41:07.866
Yes. It was a pleasure
working with you, Doctor.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.000
Pleasure was all mine.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.702
Wish me luck.

41:10.736 --> 41:11.803
Good luck.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.139
Bye.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.545
What?

41:19.578 --> 41:20.779
You know what.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.649
I think the good doc has
a little Brody crush.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.651
Don't even start with that.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.953
You off
to Voodoo Fest?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.088
Decided to stay here.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.258
I can't leave King
on his first Halloween alone.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.960
You going out?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.962
And miss all the fun here?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.597
Hell, no.
