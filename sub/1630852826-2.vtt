WEBVTT

00:16.307 --> 00:19.519
I have spent countless hours

00:19.602 --> 00:21.813
engaging with potential partners

00:21.896 --> 00:26.443
and, after all of that, like,
I've actually found my wife.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.573
It's just so crazy
that we were able to do that,

00:31.656 --> 00:33.199
like, through pods.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.326
It's so fricking weird.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.668
I am completely
in love with Nick.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.463
He's not only my fiancé,
he's my best friend,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.840
and I'm about to see him
for the first time.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.808
My God.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.814
Hello.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.576
-You're beautiful.
-You're beautiful.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.756
-I can feel your heart beating.
-Really pumping there.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.257
Mine is just as much, yeah.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.346
-Seems like it's been a lifetime.
-Yeah, it has been.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.306
-You look so pretty.
-Yeah?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.559
-I was so scared.
-Why were you so scared?

01:41.643 --> 01:44.479
Why do you think? I was like,
"What if he doesn't think I'm cute?"

01:44.562 --> 01:46.397
Of course I think you're cute.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.577
-My fiancé.
-I can't believe it.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.204
-I love you.
-Love you too.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.501
-You say it while I can see you.
-I know. I love you.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.627
Love you, too.

02:11.381 --> 02:16.845
Being able to see the face
behind the voice was just amazing.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.222
He has the most beautiful blue eyes,
and I have blue eyes.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.307
Our kids are gonna be gorgeous.
I can't wait.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.894
I'll remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.440
I was nervous,
so I put on teeth whiteners twice today.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.775
-Today?
-Yeah.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.486
-I'm so awkward.
-Oh my--

02:34.279 --> 02:35.780
Oh, I like the socks.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.741
-That's my dog.
-I figured. Oh, he's cute.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.410
Yep. It's your dog now too.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.163
He's been looking for a mommy
for a long time.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.331
-Now he's finally got one.
-He's got one.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.919
I can't believe
that I fell in love with someone,

02:50.003 --> 02:52.255
and then I didn't get to see them,

02:52.338 --> 02:55.550
and then when I did see them,
it only made it better.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.511
-We're an engaged couple.
-I know.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.015
You're gonna have to get used to me
being like this all the time.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.436
This experience, it's changed my life.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.409
I already am
anticipating the wedding day.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.746
I am so confident about the relationship
that we're going to have,

03:24.829 --> 03:26.956
that I'm ready to be
married to him tomorrow.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.209
I am not going to let
anything get in the way of this.

03:29.292 --> 03:33.379
Can't wait to just start
this wonderful life we have planned.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.883
I cannot wait to go
on this romantic getaway with Nick,

03:36.966 --> 03:39.594
because I think that
it's just going to continue to develop

03:39.677 --> 03:41.179
what we've already started developing,

03:41.262 --> 03:45.350
and I'm gonna get to spend every single
waking second with him in Mexico,

03:45.433 --> 03:47.977
and I cannot imagine
anything better than that.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.149
-Love you.
-I love you.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
Now, I just get to work on spending
the rest of my life with him.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.171


04:15.255 --> 04:16.673


04:16.756 --> 04:20.218
-Cheers.
-It's been crazy, bro. I am a believer.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.891
Let me ask you a question.
Have you ever thought of growing a beard?

04:26.975 --> 04:29.143
I don't grow a very good beard.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.938
You're an attractive guy.
Imagine with the beard?

04:32.021 --> 04:33.731
-Game over.
-Ooh.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.534
As crazy as this shit sound like
on the outside looking in,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.369
this shit is working.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.413
-Yeah.
-And I don't know how.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.041
I feel more and more certain
every single time I speak with you.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.544
I definitely feel like
I've known you for forever.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.004
Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

04:56.087 --> 04:58.923
So, would you feel comfortable
if I moved in

04:59.007 --> 05:02.593
and I wanted to change up some stuff
to make it feel more like my home?

05:04.053 --> 05:08.850
<i>Our</i> home? I mean, long as it's not,
like, nothing too crazy, like, you--

05:08.933 --> 05:10.935
Not, like, pink everywhere? No.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.523
-Did we have a sex talk yet?
-We haven't.

05:15.606 --> 05:19.360
-Are you a very affectionate person, or…
-I can be.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.281
I don't have to be making out.
I'm not a big make-outer, but…

05:23.364 --> 05:25.241
-What?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.492
You don't like to kiss?

05:26.576 --> 05:29.495
I'm not gonna lie.
Like, saliva freaks me out.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.831
-Is that weird?

05:31.914 --> 05:34.751
'Cause I think about
how many enzymes are in your saliva,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.461
and how they, like, eat away at--

05:36.544 --> 05:39.881
Yo. I've never thought about any--

05:41.007 --> 05:43.134
My brain be doing the most, bro.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.054
-Oh my God.
-Like, that's what…

05:46.137 --> 05:47.180
Oh God.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.973
Like, just thinking about it. Uh-uh.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.726
When I think of intimacy,
kissing is involved.

05:51.809 --> 05:56.356
Yes, but I don't wanna be, like,
making out for, like, five plus minutes.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.110
Stop laughing at me! Stop!

06:01.194 --> 06:03.071
-Leave me alone.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.656
She's about,
"Nah, don't kiss me too long."

06:05.740 --> 06:09.410
"How much time we done been kissing for?
Four minutes, 37 seconds. All right."

06:09.494 --> 06:11.954
"You got 30 more seconds, homie."

06:13.539 --> 06:15.333
It changes every day.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.587
Because yesterday I felt like
Mallory and I had a really good day.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.882
And then today I feel like
me and Iyanna had a really good day.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.884
So, right now, it's Iyanna.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.719
Yesterday it was Mallory.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.096
It's tough.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.317
Oh my God.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.905
That definitely gives me energy.
I'm not gonna lie.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.074
-Hi, Mal Mal.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.160
You're so funny. Hi, JerBear.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.706
Funny story. I had a dream
about you yesterday and I don't know how.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.458
-Shut up. What was it about?
-Yes.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.877
-We were at--
-Was it dirty? No, I'm kidding.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.130
No. Get your mind out the gutter.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.216
-I know. Sorry, go ahead.
-Maybe it was.

07:05.299 --> 07:09.220
You were getting fitted for some suit,
like a business suit or whatever.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.973
Taking all the measurements.
That's what you were doing.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.475
-I was sitting there, watching.
-I like that dream.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.601
I woke up like,

07:16.144 --> 07:19.313
"Yo, what? How am I dreaming
about somebody I've never met?"

07:19.397 --> 07:20.773
I was like,

07:20.857 --> 07:23.151
"What is this woman doing to me?"

07:24.277 --> 07:27.155
For real.
How the fuck is this even happening?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.450
How is this even possible
that I have not seen this person,

07:30.533 --> 07:33.286
but yet I'm starting
to develop feelings for this person?

07:34.203 --> 07:35.538
Damn.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.291
-I have a question for you.
-Hmm.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.127
What kind of rings you like?
You like gold or silver?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.422
I just-- Man, I really love gold.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.258
I sometimes even think,
if I were to get engaged,

07:47.341 --> 07:50.052
I'd even want the traditional

07:50.553 --> 07:53.473
gold setting and bands, so…

07:53.556 --> 07:54.515
But that's just me.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.393
-I don't know, that's what I like.
-All right, cool.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.645
If that's what you want, we gonna do that.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.527
Have you thought about

08:06.611 --> 08:08.738
what life or marriage
would look like between us?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.532
For sure.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.658
Bruh.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.455
If you turn me on…

08:19.248 --> 08:22.877
…through a conversation,
I'm not worried about anything else.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.214
-Sorry, I'm so awkward right now.
-Don't be scared now.

08:26.297 --> 08:30.259
What if you see me
and I'm not what you pictured?

08:30.343 --> 08:34.263
I'll be fine with what you look like.
I'm not worried about that at all.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.516
Oh my God.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.855
Let me tell you.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.358
Well, sweet dreams.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.860
-Hopefully, you dream about me too.
-Yeah.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.455
Hola.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.251
-What's up?
-What did you bring into the room?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.419
Do you have
a little cocktail there right now?

09:05.503 --> 09:08.965
I made a cocktail with tequila

09:09.048 --> 09:11.551
and then I added a splash of orange juice.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.178
-Ooh.
-'Bout to play this game with you too so…

09:14.262 --> 09:15.596
What game? I'm excited.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.474
-We're gonna be playing Never Have I Ever.
-Ooh. I really like that.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.934
-Do you?
-Yeah.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.478
I bet you do. Let's see.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.689
Never have I ever

09:24.772 --> 09:27.191
slept with someone of the same sex.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.735
-I have never.
-Okay.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.280
I have, so, I will drink.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.408
-Oh my goodness. I didn't expect that.
-Yeah.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.659
But, okay. I like that.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.160
This is rated R now.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.245
No!

09:41.497 --> 09:45.376
Okay, never have I ever had sex
in a public place.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.754
-Well, that's a lie. I definitely have.
-Really?

09:48.838 --> 09:49.714
Mm-hmm.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.132
Have you?

09:51.215 --> 09:53.342
-No, I haven't. It's always been--
-Really?

09:53.426 --> 09:57.054
Yeah, it's been behind closed doors.
Some kind of doors, you know.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.014
Okay.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.351
-Never have I ever watched porn.
-You're chugging, right?

10:03.811 --> 10:06.230
I don't know,
it's fun to do it with someone else.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.150
Oh my God. It's… Is there AC in here?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.527
Shut your ass up.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.366
Never have I ever got a tattoo.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.620
I will drink because I have one.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.830
Where?

10:23.664 --> 10:24.749
Under my boob.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.459
Ooh. What is it of?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.044
Um, it's a tree.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.963
Like the tree of life
and just kind of, like, a family tree.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.298
Ooh, yes.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.716
I like that. I like that.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.925
How about you?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.345
I have to drink. Yeah.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.639
Well, dang. What do you have?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.682
Family is really big for me too.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.561
So, my siblings and I,
we all decided to get tattoos.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.730
-Like, sibling tattoos.
-Mm-hmm.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.400
It's supposed to be, like,
four little dots that represent all of us.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.402
Oh, I like that, that's cute.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
Yeah. That's the only one I have.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.489
Oh.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.199
I really like this.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.618
Yeah, this is really nice. This is fun.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.371
Yeah. I'm really, really enjoying this.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685


11:30.564 --> 11:31.982
Oh my God.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.070
What the fuck is going on?

11:45.287 --> 11:47.498


12:05.599 --> 12:06.434
Hello?

12:08.060 --> 12:08.894
Natalie?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.399
Are you okay?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.614
Yesterday,
after our conversation,

12:20.698 --> 12:23.075
I was nervous
that I wouldn't talk to you again.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.622
If it's not you,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.584
I don't think
there's anyone else here for me.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.423
Whatever I have to do to prove
to you that I'm fully focused on you,

12:37.506 --> 12:38.340
I will do it.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.974
I wanna-- Honestly, I just
wanna hold you and hug you

12:47.475 --> 12:49.018
and make sure you're okay.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.025
Hey, do you see on your cart?

12:57.651 --> 13:00.029
-What?
-Do you see anything on your cart?

13:00.863 --> 13:03.908
What do you mean?
Did you give me a rose?

13:05.367 --> 13:09.038
It's corny and cheesy, sure,
but I just wanted to let you know,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.749
like, you are a magical person.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.711
-Thanks.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.256
You annoyed the fuck
out of me yesterday, but…

13:20.758 --> 13:22.718
Yeah, I feel like that's okay.

13:24.094 --> 13:28.182
I feel differently about you
than I ever have for someone else.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.309
All I care about
is making you happy

13:30.392 --> 13:32.311
and there is gonna be no more confusion.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.980
I just wanna focus on us,
and that's it. Really.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.857
Okay.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.447
-So, question.
-Okay.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.282
Will you be my girlfriend?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.913
Yeah, of course.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.674
I couldn't be happier.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.716
Me too.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.478
Did you have
a date with Shayne just now?

14:14.562 --> 14:15.938
-What?
-What happened?

14:16.021 --> 14:17.940
He asked me
to be his girlfriend.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.443
Are those champs?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.160
Can we popsy-pops?

14:31.161 --> 14:33.122
I'm, like, emotionally exhausted.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.015
Natalie and me have
the strongest connection,

14:51.098 --> 14:53.475
but I have feelings for Shaina too, yes.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.104
I have a romantic connection
with both of them, 100%.

14:57.187 --> 15:00.774
I just need to know where they stand
and how they feel about me.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.152
-We're all coming out better, regardless.
-100%.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.654
-So, who's your secondary wife?
-Nunya.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.615
-Sorry?
-Nunya business!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.832
Hello?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.126
-Hello.
-Hi.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.421
-How you doing, honey?
-I'm good, honey.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.797
You're toots, not honey.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.425
-Yeah. You're honey.
-I know. I fucked up.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.385
-Are you in your comfy clothes?
-I am.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.305
-What are you wearing?
-I'm wearing these men's--

15:31.889 --> 15:35.684
-Men's? Ex-boyfriend men's stuff or what?
-No. Never!

15:36.268 --> 15:40.105
No, they're like these men's gray joggers,
with a black crop top.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.942
Oh… You are so fucking hot.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.280
What's going on? Why are you holding back?

15:48.364 --> 15:51.325
I just don't want
another failed engagement.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.118
I don't wanna look stupid.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.789
You're not gonna look stupid,
so you don't need a hundred reassurances.

15:56.872 --> 15:57.873
I just need, like,

15:58.791 --> 16:00.584
just to see that you're in it.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.879
-Yeah, I told you that I care.
-Fight for it, then, or something.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.757
-You know I care. Of course I like you.
-Yeah.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.051
But again, I won't play
second fiddle to anybody.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.762
I get that, trust me.
I'm not stupid. I know that.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.473
Shayne.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.266
What?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.394
What was the conversation today?

16:18.477 --> 16:19.687
What do you mean?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.856
-Natalie?
-I--

16:22.940 --> 16:24.942
She said you asked her
to be your girlfriend.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.487
Did you say those things to Natalie?

16:29.613 --> 16:31.323
I love these questions.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.284
-Did… No--
-I love these questions.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.371
Well, no, she made sure
that she told me that you said that.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.580
Oh my God…

16:39.748 --> 16:43.711
-I'm asking you a question.
-I know, but I'm like, who cares?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.671
-I care.
-Why?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.757
-'Cause I care.
-Why do you care about that?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.093
She knows that I'm talking to you.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.971
Yeah, but if you have a girlfriend,
that's a different story.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.597
Oh my God.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.979
Whatever she says, why does it matter?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.189
Shaina?

17:04.690 --> 17:09.403
Shayne. Dude, just be honest. Yes or no?
You're making it way more difficult.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.447
-Yes, I did.
-Okay.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.198
That's all you had to say.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.158
Okay.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.284
There you go.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.707
I'm sorry, I guess…

17:26.128 --> 17:27.713
Is it over, then, or what?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.426
If you have a girlfriend, yeah.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.887
-That changes things, honey.
-Okay.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.523
I still adore you.

17:47.858 --> 17:48.984
I hope so.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.641
Damn it.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.477
Shaina's like…

18:23.977 --> 18:25.479
She's a fantastic person.

18:25.562 --> 18:29.066
And I might never see her again,
or talk to her again, and…

18:30.317 --> 18:31.944
Yeah, it just sucks.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.465
-Whoo!
Good luck.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.469


18:57.553 --> 18:59.429


18:59.513 --> 19:01.598
I'm not working out.
I make bad diet choices.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.394
Yeah, not winning any body contests
over here but, you know,

19:05.853 --> 19:07.020
it's not my strong suit.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.940
-No one cares.
-Yeah, you know…

19:10.023 --> 19:11.066
They don't care.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.195


19:15.279 --> 19:17.781
Shake is not shy at all. Clearly.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.326
The way he worded the physical questions
were very off-putting.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.245
Made me feel really uneasy.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.372
About, like,
"I'm looking for a petite girl

19:25.455 --> 19:27.916
who I can put
on my shoulders at a festival."

19:28.000 --> 19:30.586
I'm just like, "The way
you're wording that is not good."

19:30.669 --> 19:33.172
"Don't ask the question like that."

19:33.255 --> 19:36.091
-First of all, it shouldn't matter at all.
-Is he the vet?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.427
Yeah, he's the vet. Yeah.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.306
That's why I was telling you, I was like,
"Ooh. We'd be a Dr. and Mrs."

19:45.142 --> 19:47.895
Shake places importance
on the physical appearance,

19:48.478 --> 19:50.731
but we both have such similar mindsets

19:50.814 --> 19:52.858
and I've never met anybody else

19:52.941 --> 19:55.861
who's kind of gone through
the same life experiences.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.779
And I think that's really what bonds us.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.281
-We got it.
-We got this.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.867
I've never dated an Indian guy before,

20:01.950 --> 20:05.913
but I'm here to find that person
that makes me complete.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.623
How are you?

20:07.706 --> 20:10.334
-Good. You sound cheerful.
-I'm always cheerful.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.461
You always are. I like that about you.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.839
-Yeah? Thank you.
-Yeah. You're this bubbly little woman.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.009
I know that, like, we connect.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.011
-Yeah.
-But…

20:23.472 --> 20:25.682
did I ever tell you
that I lost a ton of weight?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.061
No.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.023
Um…

20:33.899 --> 20:38.612
Like, close to, like,
you know, 70, 80 pounds, probably.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.490
Wow.

20:43.700 --> 20:49.915
How the hell am I the one who's,
like, asking girls their, you know…

20:50.791 --> 20:53.168
Like, these kind of superficial questions…

20:53.252 --> 20:54.169
Mm-hmm.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.005
And, like, nobody else is?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.131
Yeah.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.092
And then I kind of felt

21:01.093 --> 21:03.470
kind of ashamed, embarrassed that I did.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.557
And I'm like, "Wow, this is the experiment
where you're not supposed to even,

21:07.641 --> 21:09.268
like, think about that stuff."

21:09.351 --> 21:12.771
And I'm like, "How am I thinking
about that the way I am?"

21:16.483 --> 21:17.609
Just ironic.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.532
-I was really chubby growing up, actually.
-Really?

21:24.783 --> 21:25.617
Yeah.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.040
I think I've had a lot
of body image issues for myself.

21:33.208 --> 21:37.713
Because I was out of shape growing up
and I was always kind of uncomfortable,

21:37.796 --> 21:41.925
I kind of would compensate
by being with somebody in good shape.

21:43.635 --> 21:48.015
I-- I'm, like… I'm, like…
kind of looking at it objectively now,

21:48.098 --> 21:50.642
probably as a result of this experience,

21:50.726 --> 21:52.602
and it's like,

21:52.686 --> 21:55.272
is this a reflection
of my own body issues?

21:55.355 --> 21:57.983
You know what I mean?
It kind of is 'cause, like,

21:58.066 --> 22:00.027
everybody has their demons

22:00.110 --> 22:04.531
and… maybe I had more demons
in this department than I thought.

22:04.614 --> 22:08.493
Yeah. Oh my gosh, I'm so glad
you shared that with me and, like,

22:10.370 --> 22:13.582
I just love that you're being
so vulnerable. It makes me so happy.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.130
You're so confident
and you're so strong and, like,

22:20.630 --> 22:23.467
the way you handled it
was really impressive.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.552
Aww…

22:25.635 --> 22:30.098
I think it's so sweet that you said
that I was confident in all these,

22:30.182 --> 22:33.352
but I really wasn't feeling that
and I had to take a step back

22:33.435 --> 22:36.063
and kind of regroup and kind of, like,

22:36.688 --> 22:39.566
do my self-talk,
'cause I'm not always the most confident.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.861
I had a lot of issues
with self-esteem and,

22:43.362 --> 22:47.866
you know, feeling like I wasn't worth it
or all those things, you know what I mean?

22:47.949 --> 22:49.910
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.121
Yeah. I think the potential
that we have here is, like,

22:53.747 --> 22:54.581
really great.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.169
And I totally see a future
with you and, like,

22:59.252 --> 23:02.923
I was just waiting to see
this vulnerable side to you.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.760
I think, you know, I think things
might really work out with us.

23:06.843 --> 23:07.677
Yeah.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.679
I really do.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.806
Aww…

23:11.306 --> 23:14.184
That just gave me butterflies.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.116
Hello.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.785
Well, well, well.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.121
-What are you wearing?
-What am I wearing?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.417
That was a genuine laugh over there.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.919
I did care for Shayne.
But Natalie,

23:41.002 --> 23:44.005
she came out very strong
with her feelings for Shayne.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.590
She was claiming her territory.

23:45.674 --> 23:49.719
So, my pride got in the way of if he had
that connection with another woman,

23:49.803 --> 23:53.598
why would I want to put myself out there?
And right now,

23:53.682 --> 23:56.309
Kyle's giving me affirmation.

23:56.393 --> 24:00.605
I love that he, right away, like,
he knew it was me that he wanted.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.150
What woman doesn't want
a man to know right away?

24:03.233 --> 24:07.779
So effortless talking to you.
Like, you gave me the chills right now.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.072
-I did?
-Yeah.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.616
-Why?
-I don't know.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.660
I just had such a good feeling.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.120
I'm trying.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.538
That's why I'm drawn to you,

24:16.621 --> 24:19.207
because you literally pull shit
right out of my mouth.

24:19.708 --> 24:24.463
Don't get me wrong.
I obviously am drawn to you…

24:25.046 --> 24:26.882
Stop. You're making me nervous.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.967
…but I'm, like, vetting you.

24:29.050 --> 24:29.885
Huh.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.430
Well, you're an intellectual, clearly.
You're very intelligent.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.098
Thanks. So are you.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.309
You never went to school?

24:37.392 --> 24:38.393
No.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.062
I love that.
I didn't go to college either.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.355
-Really?
-No.

24:42.439 --> 24:46.151
-I think college is a waste of money.
-Yeah, I agree. It wasn't worth it for me.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.612
I love your mind.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.571
It's… It's…

24:49.654 --> 24:51.990
Yeah, it's a little com… Pretty complex.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.867
-It is very complex.
-Thanks.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.452
It's scary a little bit.

24:56.828 --> 25:01.082
Do you have faith? Are you anti-faith?
Would you go to church with me on Sundays?

25:01.666 --> 25:04.961
My mom grew up religious.
They grew up Catholic.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.547
Okay.
Faith is definitely important to me.

25:07.631 --> 25:10.550
Definitely how I was raised
and how I go through life is,

25:10.634 --> 25:12.552
like, being raised, Christian.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.723
Now, I'm not religious at all.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.231
Um…

25:27.359 --> 25:28.193
So, like…

25:29.945 --> 25:31.655
I'm, like, trying to be calm.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.616
-Do you… Are you atheist?
-Yeah.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.575
Oh.

25:35.659 --> 25:39.746
I know. However you're feeling,
I can understand.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.331
-You do?
-Yeah.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.208
We need to talk about it.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.879
Oh.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.382
-Let's say we get married.
-Okay.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.218
-What if we have babies, right?
-Okay.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.886
Little Kylie's running around.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.472
And they're at the dinner table. Okay?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.267
-And you say, "Let's say grace."
-Yes.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.186
I'll try and fart or burp and say,
"Who's Grace?"

26:03.270 --> 26:07.274
No! See?
That's a question I need to ask you.

26:07.357 --> 26:12.571
You're asking me if I'm okay with you
instilling the religion into our children?

26:12.654 --> 26:14.072
-Yeah.
-That's fine.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.659
-But, like, what about for you?
-The kids will get to decide like I did.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.828
I want to know why you're an atheist.

26:21.705 --> 26:25.417
I just believe science.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.168
God <i>is</i> science.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.755
But the science doesn't check out.

26:31.673 --> 26:32.507
Says who?

26:32.591 --> 26:36.177
Says a lot of people.
I am resistant to brainwashing.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.013
I think you <i>are</i> brainwashed.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.223
-I could argue the same.
-Not really.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.809
You think we are accidentally here.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.812
-It's not an accident.
-Exactly.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.023
No, look, it's literally, like--

26:48.106 --> 26:52.736
-So, you believe the Big Bang Theory?
-Yeah. It's explained. It makes sense.

26:52.819 --> 26:56.990
-No, it doesn't… It makes no sense.
-So, you don't believe in evolution?

26:57.073 --> 26:58.950
-I do not believe in it at all.
-Stop it.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.620
-I do not.
-That's so fucked up.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.457
-Oh my God. Kyle…
-There's some guy who wrote a book.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.792
-Some guy?
-Yeah, wrote the Bible.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.169
Have you ever read it?

27:09.252 --> 27:11.379
-I've read parts of it and I am--
-So, exactly.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.090
Every atheist has said that
and until you read it,

27:14.174 --> 27:15.675
you can't say anything about it.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.053
-You'll never change my mind.
-I'm not trying to.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.972
I know, but I'm also not gonna, like,

27:21.056 --> 27:22.599
understand that.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.142
-I'll pray for you.
-I…

27:27.937 --> 27:31.066
Shaina has extreme views on religion,

27:31.149 --> 27:35.153
and I have extreme views on religion.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.447
Deep down inside,
I knew it was too good to be true.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.533
-Ouch.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.411
I could definitely
fall in love with Shaina.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.122
But, like, we are such polar opposites.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.710
And I don't think either of us
are gonna change each other.

27:51.711 --> 27:52.921
And it scares me.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.638
Maybe I was floating away a little bit,
and I was just grounded.

28:04.849 --> 28:05.725
Yeah.

28:33.086 --> 28:36.798
Honestly, really being here just…
It really made me question,

28:36.881 --> 28:38.883
did I know the people
that I was with before?

28:39.384 --> 28:42.929
Like, how was I in relationships?
Was it real love?

28:43.012 --> 28:45.348
I'll be very honest, for my situation,

28:45.432 --> 28:47.684
-I have not gone for a girl…
-Yeah.

28:47.767 --> 28:50.603
…like Deeps, but I feel
really fucking good about it.

28:50.687 --> 28:55.650
I'm beyond words how excited I am
about finding someone like Deeps.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.237
So, do you see yourself having kids?
Like, how many kids do you want?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.197
I definitely don't want just one.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.116
I want as many as I can afford.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.285
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

29:05.368 --> 29:09.080
This is definitely my first time
feeling this particular way about someone.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.709
Without a doubt,
I have never felt so close,

29:12.792 --> 29:16.921
so deep, so strong, so quickly.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.382
Even in some of the Indian traditions,

29:19.466 --> 29:22.802
like touching the man's feet
when I get married.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.930
-Like, fuck that.
-I am right there with you.

29:27.932 --> 29:32.812
I've come a long way, getting past
superficial motivations for things

29:32.896 --> 29:34.856
and working through my insecurities.

29:34.939 --> 29:38.318
I love being a vet,
I hate the lifestyle of a vet.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.654
So, owning your own practice,
you'd have to be able to be flexible.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.239
Not for a little while.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.950
I like to be
financially independent completely--

29:46.034 --> 29:49.704
Me, too. We're gonna have some smart,
awesome kids. I just know it.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.997
Aww…

29:51.080 --> 29:54.209
Deepti is like a puzzle piece that fits.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.294
She fits in a way
nobody else has ever fit.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.614


30:24.697 --> 30:26.324
-Hello.
-Hey.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.368
-Hi.
-How's it goin'?

30:28.451 --> 30:30.662
-Good, how are you?
-I'm good.

30:38.545 --> 30:43.007
I wanted to just say something
from the heart here.

30:45.802 --> 30:50.265
So, when coincidence seems too convenient,

30:50.765 --> 30:52.976
I prefer to call that fate.

30:54.102 --> 31:00.149
And I've never met someone
who seems to understand me the way you do.

31:01.276 --> 31:05.989
Our stories are so similar
and they've already begun to intertwine.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.994
You make me feel some type of way.

31:12.787 --> 31:16.583
I'm gonna ask you
to approach the wall here.

31:17.208 --> 31:21.212
-Oh, I wish I could feel you.
-I know. I wish the same thing.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.592
So, I'm gonna get down on one knee.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.097
And, Deepti,

31:31.639 --> 31:34.684
will you make me the luckiest man
in the world and marry me?

31:34.767 --> 31:38.146
Oh my gosh. Abi.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.695
I never thought
that I would meet someone like you and…

31:45.778 --> 31:51.034
Oh, man, I feel like fate has just
gravitated us towards each other,

31:51.117 --> 31:54.037
and a thousand times yes!

31:54.120 --> 31:55.288
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

31:55.371 --> 31:57.749
-Yes! All right!
-I wish I could hug you right now.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.919
-I know. Oh my gosh, and then some.
-Abi, can't wait to see you.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.838
-Wow, that feels amazing.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.881
Whoo.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.799
-We're engaged!
-We're engaged.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.052
-We're fucking engaged.
-I can't believe it.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.511
Ah!

32:11.888 --> 32:14.307
-Rest of our lives, baby.
-Rest of our lives.

32:14.390 --> 32:17.518
-Oh my God. I just got goosebumps.
-Ah! I'm so excited!

32:29.906 --> 32:30.740
Bye.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.125
-I'm engaged!
-Yeah!

32:41.209 --> 32:43.127
Congratulations, hon!

32:43.211 --> 32:45.964
Thank you!

32:46.965 --> 32:49.509
Thank you! Thanks.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.225
-Really?
-That is…

33:00.395 --> 33:03.189
So, I think if we're going
to get married at the end of this,

33:03.272 --> 33:04.857
I want you to know everything.

33:04.941 --> 33:09.362
Yeah. So, do-- do you think
there's, like, one thing

33:09.445 --> 33:12.615
that would be, like,
the complete deal breaker in a marriage?

33:12.699 --> 33:15.284
Like, "Nah, this happened?
This divorce is inevitable."

33:15.410 --> 33:18.621
For me, it's cheating.
And I mean, like, any form of cheating.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.165
Like emotional cheating,
or like, physically cheating.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.333
So, do you…

33:22.417 --> 33:23.751
Do you think you have any…

33:24.544 --> 33:26.379
any traumas that you're still,

33:26.462 --> 33:27.880
like, working through?

33:30.133 --> 33:34.053
So, I was sexually assaulted
when I was 17.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.139
-Hmm.
-Like, my heart is healed.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.307
It's just, like,
sometimes my body remembers.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.726
I mean, it can be difficult.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.186
Like, I'm very, very, very selective on

33:42.270 --> 33:44.564
who I allow to get
very, very close to me.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.316
-Yeah.
-I can make quick acquaintances, very…

33:47.400 --> 33:48.526
Like, that's fine.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.654
But when it comes down to it,
like, who am I investing my time with?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.573
-Mm-hmm.
-And it's not that many people,

33:53.656 --> 33:55.366
because I'm just very, very selective.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.367
Mm-hmm.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.619
You are one resilient person.

34:00.329 --> 34:04.208
It doesn't feel fresh, but, um,
there's still some, like, lingering…

34:04.292 --> 34:05.918
um, things that…

34:06.002 --> 34:08.755
I don't know, make me,
I guess, like, have reflexes.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.507
'Cause, I mean,
I already struggle with trust in general

34:11.591 --> 34:14.927
and strangely enough, like,
I feel like I trust you enough.

34:15.011 --> 34:18.264
I mean, I do trust--
I understand you, like, extremely well.

34:18.347 --> 34:21.142
-That's huge.
-Yeah.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.394
It is big.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.522
Listen, outside of my family
and my close friends, like…

34:27.231 --> 34:28.941
no one-- <i>no one</i> knows this.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.735
-Mm-hmm.
-Um…

34:31.319 --> 34:33.362
A year ago…

34:36.157 --> 34:39.035
-Almost lost my life.
-What?

34:40.036 --> 34:42.163
I had an issue with someone

34:42.246 --> 34:44.373
who I thought was
a really close friend of mine.

34:45.249 --> 34:48.336
There'd been friction
between us for-- for quite some time.

34:48.419 --> 34:50.880
We-- We had had, like, an issue.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.007
I never saw the knife in his hand.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.426
I was stabbed.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.602
Oh my God.

35:09.982 --> 35:13.694
Yeah. I end up passing out.
That's-- that's all I remember.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.822
I woke up the next morning and

35:16.906 --> 35:21.160
have all these fucking tubes down my nose.
Didn't even know that I was gonna make it.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.914
Probably one of the lowest points
of my life.

35:25.498 --> 35:26.999
-Oh my God.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.878
-Jesus.
-Right.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.632
I haven't had anybody there
to go through this with.

35:39.512 --> 35:43.516
I'm so sorry you went through that.
That's a lot.

35:48.771 --> 35:49.772
Dang, Jarrette.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.776
I'm so sorry.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.988
So, everything happens for a reason.
That's how I gotta look at it.

35:57.071 --> 36:01.284
Yeah. Honestly,
it feels nice to open up to you.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.204
And then for you to receive it so well,
it feels nice.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.167
I don't think I have
anything else to think about anymore.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.335
I think it's you.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.215
Whoo.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.347
I've made connections
with you and Mallory.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.893
And it's just, my brain is flustered.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.478
I've literally been
going back and forth every day.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.574


36:41.657 --> 36:44.202


36:45.369 --> 36:47.788


36:47.872 --> 36:48.706
Good luck, gents.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.918
All right, fellas.
Enjoy yourself. Make me proud.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.925
We've been having such deep conversations,

36:59.008 --> 37:01.135
I kind of bypassed all the basic shit.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.222
-What do you mean?
-What you do for work?

37:04.305 --> 37:07.350
I'm the communications manager
for a non-profit.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.728
This is the first time I've heard that.
I didn't ask this.

37:10.811 --> 37:14.023
Really? Maybe we didn't talk about this.
And what about you?

37:14.106 --> 37:16.025
-So, I wear a couple hats.
-Okay.

37:16.108 --> 37:19.028
So, my full-time job is
I'm a healthcare consultant,

37:19.111 --> 37:21.864
and on the side,
some of my entrepreneurial things I do,

37:21.948 --> 37:23.699
I cut hair. So, part-time barber.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.327
Couple friends of mine,
we buy and resell sneakers.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.038
And then I just started
my own mobile hookah business.

37:29.121 --> 37:32.375
Wow, I like that.
So, you're a hustler for sure.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.086
Yeah. I have a very
big entrepreneurial mind.

37:35.169 --> 37:38.047
So, I want myself and my wife
to dive into that.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.216
-Like, let's own property.
-Yeah.

37:40.299 --> 37:44.053
I want to make sure our kids are fine
when they go to college, grow up.

37:44.136 --> 37:48.641
That works. Yeah. It's so important to me.
I really love that about you.

37:51.435 --> 37:55.481
I don't know if I mentioned this,
but I'm also a homeowner.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.316
Oh.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.402
Yes, I do. I own a two flat.

37:59.485 --> 38:02.613
-Hey, okay.
-Yeah. It's my investments.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.241
What do you think that would look like
with your husband?

38:07.410 --> 38:12.081
I wanna be with somebody who is,
like, a partner in all that, right?

38:13.499 --> 38:15.793
We can decide,
do we want to live in your condo,

38:15.876 --> 38:17.837
or do we want to live in my house?

38:19.046 --> 38:21.507
Or do we want to rent both out
and get something else?

38:21.590 --> 38:24.552
-I do have a dog. So…
-What kind of dog you got?

38:24.635 --> 38:25.970
I got a German Shepherd.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.180
-I fucking love German Shepherds.
-Do you?

38:28.264 --> 38:31.225
She's a huge baby.
She's two and a half years old.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.145
-You be snuggling with her?
-Oh my God. Yeah.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.313
She's very cuddly.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.940
Are you a big cuddler?

38:38.024 --> 38:40.985
I'm definitely a cuddler for sure.
I like to cuddle.

38:41.068 --> 38:44.113
Um… Feel like I haven't done it
in a really long time.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.615
Mm-hmm.
You wanna cuddle with me?

38:47.116 --> 38:50.286
You sound like
you'd be a good cuddler.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.919
Well, good night.
Sweet dreams, JerBear.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.926


39:06.510 --> 39:09.597


39:14.018 --> 39:16.562
-Yeah, I need…
-Pretend I'm a lady and you're trying to--

39:16.645 --> 39:17.855
Oh, yeah, bro.

39:20.816 --> 39:23.152


39:24.070 --> 39:26.614
I have good connections
with both Sal and Jarrette,

39:26.697 --> 39:30.368
but I definitely feel like Jarrette
is a little bit more vocal

39:30.451 --> 39:33.412
about, like, seeing me in marriage.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.875
But I want to stay open because I know
that he's talking to other people.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.835
He's talking to other people, so is Sal.

39:39.919 --> 39:44.340
I think it's important to try to explore
every conversation, every option.

39:44.423 --> 39:48.135
It's just a lot of time
to sit with my feelings and my thoughts.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.056
And it's scary, and I'm scared. So…

39:52.556 --> 39:54.600
I'm emotional. Um…

39:56.602 --> 39:57.436
So, yeah.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.025
Mal, how you feeling?

40:03.109 --> 40:06.112
I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling really good. Yeah.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.448
I've thought about you a lot.
It's just really interesting.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.993
Yeah, or just finding myself,
like, thinking about you,

40:13.494 --> 40:15.538
you know, like, throughout the day.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.957
Obviously, you know,
I really like you and…

40:18.040 --> 40:18.874
Yeah.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.502
And getting to know you
has been very exciting.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.380
It was so fast,
but so slow at the same time.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.173
-Yeah.
-You know? It's…

40:26.257 --> 40:28.092
-Mm-hmm.
-I know it's a lot.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.176
Mm-hmm.

40:30.636 --> 40:36.642
You know, it's, like, the rational part
of me and my brain is like,

40:36.725 --> 40:38.644
"What the fuck are you doing?"

40:38.727 --> 40:41.272
-Like, this is crazy.
-Mmm.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.899
But, I think
maybe for the first time

40:43.983 --> 40:46.110
I'm not listening to that.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.194
Yeah.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.197
This whole experience
has definitely made me feel

40:50.281 --> 40:52.408
like I've dated
the wrong way my whole life.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.453
This has changed me a lot,
and made me a better man.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.539
I really do feel like I'm falling for you.

41:00.166 --> 41:04.253
And that's what I feel
has been the scariest thing.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.047
You make me want to take
that risk with you.

41:07.131 --> 41:07.965
Mm-hmm.

41:08.048 --> 41:11.927
So, I did prepare something.
It's super cheesy.

41:12.011 --> 41:12.970
Oh. Okay.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.096
You ready for this?

41:14.180 --> 41:15.181
I'm ready.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.029
Oh my God.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.365
You're so cute!

42:14.448 --> 42:16.283
That was so good.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.745
I am so red. I cannot…

42:20.412 --> 42:21.288
Oh man…

42:21.372 --> 42:24.124
-That was, like, the nicest thing…

42:24.208 --> 42:25.960
…anyone's ever done for me.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.963
Oh my God, you're so cute.

43:01.370 --> 43:05.457
I think in the past I've always
been trying to run away from my culture.

43:05.541 --> 43:09.086
I honestly think that in my prior ways

43:09.169 --> 43:12.923
I would've passed over an opportunity
to connect with a girl like Deepti.

43:13.424 --> 43:16.343
As soon as I see her,
it's gonna be two hands.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.429
Boom. I already let her know.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.680
From here on out,

43:20.347 --> 43:23.100
she's within a two-mile radius from me,

43:23.183 --> 43:24.560
that booty is not safe.

43:36.447 --> 43:41.994
I think Shake does place importance
on appearance and physical aspects

43:42.077 --> 43:45.914
because, you know,
to connect physically is important to him,

43:45.998 --> 43:50.419
but eliminating the physical piece of it
has created such a bond

43:50.502 --> 43:53.589
and such a foundational stability for us.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.883
He's actually this really sweet,

43:55.966 --> 44:01.597
articulate, sensitive,
and fun, outgoing person.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.642
I just think
he's just a beautiful person inside out

44:04.725 --> 44:07.186
and I can't wait
to spend the rest of my life with him.

44:11.065 --> 44:15.194
I've learned physical attraction
isn't <i>the</i> biggest thing.

44:15.694 --> 44:19.448
My test for if I can date a girl or not,

44:19.531 --> 44:23.243
which is, if I can put her on my shoulders
at a music festival,

44:23.327 --> 44:27.665
then she's within
a physical range that I would date,

44:27.748 --> 44:31.794
which, you know, looking back at,
is such a superficial thing.

44:31.877 --> 44:35.297
And I think I put on a front

44:35.381 --> 44:37.883
and try to be cool or try to be edgy.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.844
All kinds of things
that I use to protect myself.

44:40.928 --> 44:43.514
I'm very fortunate
to have been a part of this experiment

44:43.597 --> 44:46.642
and I think I landed
an incredible woman because of it.

44:48.769 --> 44:53.107
I think that Shake would not have gone
for me if we were in the real world.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.526
I think Shake definitely wants

44:55.609 --> 44:59.613
the most attractive woman
in the room, kind of.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.407
And so, I don't know,

45:01.490 --> 45:04.034
I'm just waiting to see
what his initial reaction is,

45:04.118 --> 45:06.036
what his facial expressions are.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.415
When I touch him, I hope,
you know, I feel that spark

45:09.498 --> 45:11.750
and, you know, that he feels it back.

45:11.834 --> 45:15.754
I hope that he sees
that we can build a life together,

45:15.838 --> 45:19.299
even though I don't look
like the typical girl he would go for.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.343
I hope he likes me.

45:21.427 --> 45:25.639
And I'm terrified.
I'd say I'm definitely terrified.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.743
-Holy shit.
-Hi.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.412
-Oh my God.

45:48.495 --> 45:49.455
Oh my God.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.707
-Oh my God.
-Hi!

45:51.790 --> 45:52.791
Oh my God.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.502
Oh my God. You're so beautiful.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.920
Holy shit.

45:57.004 --> 45:59.757
-Hi!
-Look at that booty.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.592
Oh my God. You're perfect.

46:01.675 --> 46:04.762
-Hi!
-You're gonna be my fucking wife.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.764
You're gonna be my husband.

46:07.473 --> 46:08.557
Oh my God.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.185
He was just like…

46:11.852 --> 46:14.104
Just so surprised to see me.

46:14.605 --> 46:18.108
I don't think he expected me
to look the way I looked.

46:18.192 --> 46:21.069
-He went straight for the ass.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.614
Um, which I love.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.783
Oh my God.

46:27.242 --> 46:28.869
-I have something for you.
-Yeah?

46:28.952 --> 46:29.912
Mm-hmm.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.210
-You did not just do that.
-I'd do it for you.

46:39.338 --> 46:42.382
In the Indian culture,
when you get married,

46:42.466 --> 46:45.135
the wife touches the husband's feet,

46:45.219 --> 46:48.514
and I told him I'm not doing that
because we're equals.

46:49.348 --> 46:52.476
And so the fact
that he touched my feet was perfect.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.977
He's perfect.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.355
Oh my gosh.

47:00.275 --> 47:02.444
Oh my gosh. It's stunning.

47:06.031 --> 47:06.949
All right.

47:07.533 --> 47:08.492
Here you go.

47:09.701 --> 47:10.619
Wow.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.413
-How's it look?
-It looks stunning.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.249
You look stunning.

47:20.838 --> 47:24.550
It's crazy. I can't believe
I have a ring on my finger. Like…

47:24.633 --> 47:26.343
I've wanted this my whole life.

47:27.594 --> 47:30.055
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

47:30.556 --> 47:34.977
Oh, I can't believe I waited
30 whole years to find my person.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.020
Holy shit.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.982
You are so handsome. Little puppy dog.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.942
-Well…

47:42.025 --> 47:44.236
You're so cute! Come here.

47:47.447 --> 47:50.075
Even though I've dated
so many blonde girls

47:50.158 --> 47:52.870
and… and white girls in the past,

47:52.953 --> 47:55.247
Deeps is just perfect.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.167
Deepti is one of the best things
to ever happen to me.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.546
I hope I'm gonna make her
as happy as she deserves to be.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.131
That's what I'm nervous about.

48:04.214 --> 48:08.135
Honestly, like,
you're everything that I would want.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.219
I mean it.

48:09.303 --> 48:11.096
It just gave me butterflies.

48:22.232 --> 48:24.109
-We're gonna have so much fun.
-Mm-hmm.

48:24.192 --> 48:26.028
And I'm gonna get you pregnant.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.906
-Get outta here.
-All right. Here, take that.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.574
-I'll see you soon.
-Okay.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.454
Whoo.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.507
I'm all right with that.

48:59.770 --> 49:03.148
In the past,
I've been way too harsh on people,

49:03.231 --> 49:05.108
been way too stubborn.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.568
But going through this,

49:06.652 --> 49:11.865
I realize that the ultimate goal is
who can I be the happiest with?

49:12.908 --> 49:15.118
Shaina puts up with my strong personality.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.746
She knows how to make me happy,

49:17.829 --> 49:20.082
and whenever I hear her voice,

49:20.165 --> 49:22.584
she just, like, lifts my spirits.

49:22.668 --> 49:26.838
Am I gonna throw away an amazing woman
because we disagree on religion?

49:26.922 --> 49:30.842
I've never had that dilemma,
but my head has never been more clear.

49:33.428 --> 49:34.721
Hello.

49:35.305 --> 49:36.765
Good morning, beautiful.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.523
Oh my God.

49:44.606 --> 49:45.691
How are you?

49:46.566 --> 49:47.401
Um…

49:47.484 --> 49:49.444
I'm okay.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.445
How are you?

49:50.529 --> 49:52.698
I'm-- I'm feeling amazing.

49:55.033 --> 49:56.827
-You are?
-How are you feeling?

49:58.412 --> 50:00.497
Um, I'm good.

50:02.124 --> 50:05.293
I… have some questions.

50:05.377 --> 50:06.211
Okay.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.881
Our differences, like,
the clear differences…

50:09.965 --> 50:10.799
Yeah.

50:11.591 --> 50:13.343
-Like, our core values.
-Yeah.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.846
Does that, like, scare you? Like…

50:16.763 --> 50:20.809
I think that,
at this stage of my life, I can't.

50:20.892 --> 50:23.311
I'll never find that perfect person

50:24.938 --> 50:27.024
where everything aligns so perfectly.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.191
But our big things?

50:28.692 --> 50:31.903
They don't change
how much love I have for you.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.242
Does it scare you?

50:40.912 --> 50:43.415
There's a part of me that does feel right.

50:43.498 --> 50:47.294
-Yeah.
-And then, I'm like, "Will we combust?"

50:50.714 --> 50:52.299
We have to risk it, honey.

50:53.925 --> 50:56.970
-Right.
-Because I don't wanna have regrets.

51:03.602 --> 51:06.563
-Do you see the box?
-I do.

51:09.107 --> 51:11.109
-Oh my God.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.614
-Are you holding it?
-Do you want me to hold it?

51:15.697 --> 51:17.741
-I want you to, yeah.
-Okay.

51:21.286 --> 51:24.039
You're holding
my mother's engagement ring.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.212
You remind me so much of my mother.

51:31.963 --> 51:36.176
She was very, very religious,

51:36.259 --> 51:40.847
and she makes me the happiest.
I want someone who resembles her.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.975
So… Shaina…

51:46.645 --> 51:48.772
Can you open your box, please?

51:59.032 --> 52:00.242
Oh my God.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.036
Will you marry me?

52:21.805 --> 52:23.223
Yes.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.642
Oh my God.

52:29.187 --> 52:33.608
I'm dying to just grab your face

52:33.692 --> 52:34.776
and kiss you.

52:41.032 --> 52:44.452
-Do you know how much a kiss means?
-Everything.

52:44.536 --> 52:48.623
Yeah, it's the best feeling in the world
to kiss somebody that you love.

52:49.207 --> 52:51.293
I'm kind of in shock right now.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.796
I know,

52:54.880 --> 52:57.924
and I didn't expect to ever pull that out.

52:58.508 --> 53:02.470
I brought it with anticipation
that maybe I would find somebody,

53:02.554 --> 53:05.015
and you are the perfect person for it.

53:10.103 --> 53:12.355
I'm in shock. I haven't put it on yet.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.566
Are you excited to see me?

53:16.193 --> 53:18.361
I'm so excited to see you.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.407
Oh my God.

53:23.491 --> 53:24.618
I'll see you.

53:25.702 --> 53:26.703
Okay.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.121
Goodbye, beautiful.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.241
I just need, like, a second.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.331
So, why…
So, why are you crying?

54:11.915 --> 54:15.377
I guess it's just the idea of,
like, being engaged again,

54:15.460 --> 54:19.506
and, um… I just don't want
to make, like, another mistake.

54:21.132 --> 54:23.260
I care about Kyle a lot,

54:23.343 --> 54:25.178
but there's issues.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.806
Huge things that we both…

54:29.849 --> 54:31.559
do not see eye-to-eye on.

54:39.526 --> 54:40.360
Sorry.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.489
It's terrifying.

54:44.572 --> 54:46.950
I made my past mistakes

54:47.033 --> 54:50.120
in not having integrity
and staying true to myself.

54:50.203 --> 54:51.037
And I…

54:51.705 --> 54:53.790
Am I making that same mistake?

54:54.541 --> 54:55.667
I don't know.

54:57.585 --> 54:59.587


55:01.881 --> 55:04.843
Joey, give me a pump-up speech.
I want you, the quietest one.

55:04.926 --> 55:07.762
-Shayne, you're gonna do great, buddy.
-Okay. That's it?

55:07.846 --> 55:10.307
-Yeah.

55:10.390 --> 55:13.310
God, you are bad. You will never be
my best man at my wedding.

55:13.393 --> 55:16.187
-All right. Cheers, boys.
-Cheers, boys.

55:16.730 --> 55:20.692
This whole experiment's been crazy, but,
like, somehow it works.

55:20.775 --> 55:22.902
I developed strong feelings
for two people.

55:22.986 --> 55:26.906
I had deep, deep feelings for Shaina,
but Shaina was always hesitant.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.701
I mean, she never really
actually told me how she felt.

55:31.244 --> 55:34.539
Natalie asserted herself,
and she just made me feel

55:34.622 --> 55:35.749
so safe and secure,

55:35.832 --> 55:37.459
and that's what I wanted.

55:37.542 --> 55:40.962
Shayne, I just need
to let you know you're my favorite.

55:41.546 --> 55:43.465
-Oh.

55:43.548 --> 55:47.594
When I first met Natalie,
we had the most smoothest conversation.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.429
We laugh constantly with each other,

55:49.512 --> 55:51.806
but we can also get
to a deeper connection as well.

55:52.390 --> 55:55.435
-Tell me about your family.
-My mom is, like, my best friend.

55:55.518 --> 55:58.772
Um… So, we… I FaceTime her all the time.

55:58.855 --> 56:01.649
I love that you have
a really close relationship with your mom.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.361
And you definitely make
me feel comfortable.

56:07.822 --> 56:10.408
She makes me feel excited.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.244
Honestly, it's that euphoria
you feel from someone

56:13.328 --> 56:15.830
when it's, like,
she just gives you butterflies.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.416
And I always said,
when you know, you kind of know.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.877
You just have that feeling. It's wild.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.004
-Yes!
-You got it?

56:23.088 --> 56:25.298
Yes! Oh my God.
This is so exciting.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.133
-There we go. Perfect.
-I'm so happy.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.845
-I can't believe you made this happen.
-Honey, I will make everything hap…

56:30.929 --> 56:33.515
Whatever you want to happen,
I will make it happen.

56:34.432 --> 56:36.893
I've brought one girl home
to my mom in my entire life.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.478
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

56:38.561 --> 56:41.731
I've talked to you
and gotten such deeper, like,

56:41.815 --> 56:44.609
connections with you
in these, what, seven days,

56:44.692 --> 56:47.153
than I talked to her for six months.

56:47.779 --> 56:51.533
It's been such a short period of time,
but I feel like I've known her forever.

56:51.616 --> 56:56.079
I mean, I'm riding so high on her
and I'm ready to propose to this woman,

56:56.162 --> 56:57.122
100%.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.249
It's crazy to think.

57:04.879 --> 57:06.381
-Hello.
-Hi.

57:06.464 --> 57:07.298
Hi.

57:10.301 --> 57:13.638
You know, so,
I'm trying to think of all of my thoughts

57:13.721 --> 57:15.765
and emotions about how I feel,

57:15.849 --> 57:18.435
and when I think
about this whole experience, it's like…

57:18.518 --> 57:21.062
This is exactly how I feel
like we were supposed to meet.

57:22.856 --> 57:23.940
Are you okay?

57:24.482 --> 57:26.568
I'm good. Um…

57:29.571 --> 57:30.613
So…

57:30.697 --> 57:31.823
Is it Shaina?

57:32.991 --> 57:33.867
Yeah.

57:36.911 --> 57:40.540
I'm just… Would love
for you to hear me out real quick.

57:40.623 --> 57:41.458
Okay.

57:43.418 --> 57:44.794
Um…

57:47.172 --> 57:48.339
Okay.

57:50.258 --> 57:54.888
I just wanted you to know
that I do have deep feelings for you.

57:56.806 --> 57:57.724
What the fuck.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.021
Fuck.
