00:13.556 --> 00:16.196
<i>Good morning, handsome!
It's you!</i>

00:16.226 --> 00:17.986
<i>- 7:00! Time to get up
- Ugh.</i>

00:18.066 --> 00:19.596
<i>- and start that day!
- Not this again.</i>

00:19.636 --> 00:22.496
<i>It's the 12th!
You have three more days</i>

00:22.506 --> 00:25.766
<i>till the Science Now conference
to unveil O.S. Sparkle Dream.</i>

00:25.806 --> 00:29.306
- O.S. Sparkle Dream? Idiot.
- So, here's today's to-do list.

00:29.346 --> 00:32.276
<i>One ... hug Sally and remind her
how dang special she is.</i>

00:32.316 --> 00:34.746
<i>- Two ... take little rocket for a walk in the park.
- You're dead. You can stop now.</i>

00:34.776 --> 00:37.016
<i>- Three ... get out of bed and go
- Oh, my god.</i>

00:37.046 --> 00:38.646
<i>- make a difference in the world!
- How many of these did you record?</i>

00:38.686 --> 00:40.756
<i>- Four ... get that operating system...
- Can't take it.</i>

00:40.786 --> 00:43.456
<i>- ...bug-free and user-loving.
- It's like Casper gets up at 7:00 every morning.</i>

00:43.486 --> 00:44.836
<i>Just three more days
till that conference.</i>

00:44.876 --> 00:46.386
<i>Have a scientastic day!</i>

00:46.426 --> 00:50.136
That's my line!
You stole my thing!

00:50.246 --> 00:52.416
I got to figure out
how turn that alarm off.

01:01.186 --> 01:04.525
Ah, working 'round the clock.
How's my build team?

01:04.556 --> 01:06.426
- What do we got for me?
- Breakfast burrito?

01:06.466 --> 01:08.026
<i>They're awesome!</i>

01:08.066 --> 01:10.266
But they taste a little
bit like rubidium chloride.

01:10.296 --> 01:12.366
Ah, so that's what you've
been working on, hmm?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.636
I love it. We'll have to
militarize it, of course ...

01:14.666 --> 01:18.506
slap on a coat of Venture blue
and call it the Zip-a-rounder.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.876
- It's called a Segway.
- Mm. Clever. I like it.

01:21.906 --> 01:23.976
But Zip-a-rounder has
more pop, more pizzazz.

01:24.016 --> 01:25.516
No, it's already called a Segway,

01:25.546 --> 01:27.286
'cause it was invented a long time ago.

01:27.316 --> 01:29.086
Doc, you got to get up on this stuff.

01:29.116 --> 01:32.156
Super science has changed
since you were last... vital.

01:32.186 --> 01:33.656
Oh, I'm vital, Billy.

01:33.686 --> 01:36.286
Guess who's been invited to
the Science Now conference?

01:36.326 --> 01:38.226
Weren't you banned from that conference

01:38.256 --> 01:40.926
'cause you showed a vacuum
cleaner that leaked radiation?

01:40.966 --> 01:42.366
That it immediately cleaned up

01:42.396 --> 01:44.566
because it was that
good of a vacuum? Yes.

01:44.596 --> 01:46.966
But they know a good thing,
and I'm a good thing.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.336
So, what are you gonna present?

01:48.366 --> 01:50.306
Well, that's why I'm
down here! You tell me!

01:50.336 --> 01:54.106
Wow me! Stick your finger into
my ear and tickle my brain.

01:54.146 --> 01:56.306
Reach right up my ass and grab my heart.

01:56.346 --> 01:58.946
Yeesh. I-I could've lived
without that last one.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.286
<i>Well, if you stop harassing Venture ...</i>

02:01.316 --> 02:03.956
<i>and, baby, I mean, like,
stop even talking about it ...</i>

02:03.986 --> 02:06.556
<i>I can get you bumped up to
a level 8 at the meeting tonight.</i>

02:06.586 --> 02:08.126
<i>Good, right?</i>

02:08.156 --> 02:10.096
<i>Sweetie? Right?</i>

02:10.126 --> 02:11.526
Come on! Let's just do it.

02:11.556 --> 02:13.996
It would be awesome.
This is your damn birthright!

02:14.026 --> 02:16.026
Stop. My wife
is watching me like a hawk

02:16.066 --> 02:18.296
after that little stunt
Copy-cat pulled on me.

02:18.366 --> 02:21.166
<i>Let's just turn this hole
into the Monarch's Egg sac</i>

02:21.206 --> 02:22.436
<i>and impress the Guild.</i>

02:22.476 --> 02:24.706
Ohh, just wait till they see my Egg sac!

02:24.736 --> 02:27.306
The Egg sac, besides
being the single worst name

02:27.346 --> 02:28.946
for a secret lair, isn't gonna cut it.

02:28.976 --> 02:30.646
Then what's your great idea, hmm?

02:30.676 --> 02:34.116
Put on these halloween waiter
outfits and be good guys?

02:34.146 --> 02:37.286
No! Well, yes.
If we become Blue Morpho and Kano,

02:37.316 --> 02:40.756
we could take out every villain
arching Venture, leaving who?

02:40.786 --> 02:43.526
Us, yes ... to be Venture's
only arch villains!

02:43.556 --> 02:46.056
I'm never gonna be a good guy.
I'm a villain!

02:46.096 --> 02:49.766
I shower in this cowl.
I laugh at regular jokes like this.

02:52.266 --> 02:53.536
I'm a super villain.

02:53.566 --> 02:56.036
My dad wasn't. So, no.

02:56.076 --> 03:00.006
Blue Morpho wore this villain mask!
He was all sinister and stuff.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.606
You saw the comics!

03:01.646 --> 03:05.046
Oh, yes, the same comics that
never mentioned he had a kid.

03:05.076 --> 03:07.616
Ironclad historical document that ended

03:07.646 --> 03:10.686
with my dad giving fruit
pies to troubled teens.

03:10.716 --> 03:12.986
I am not a good guy. Period.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.756
I'm making this place into an Egg sac.

03:14.786 --> 03:18.726
<i>Se√±or Monarch, sir,
your wife is coming downstairs.</i>

03:18.756 --> 03:20.266
Run!

03:20.296 --> 03:22.426
<i>Move! Go!
Come on, with pep!</i>

03:22.466 --> 03:25.466
Honey?
Where's my kiss goodbye?

03:25.506 --> 03:29.066
Hello? What happened to you?
You just ...

03:29.106 --> 03:31.606
Uh, s-step, step,
quick-quick, step.

03:31.636 --> 03:34.546
<i>Step, step and tan-go close.</i>

03:34.576 --> 03:36.306
Oh! Uh, sweetie! Hi!

03:36.376 --> 03:39.176
We were just, uh,
tangoing, because, um ...

03:39.216 --> 03:40.686
Because of our training routine.

03:40.716 --> 03:44.456
A good villain/henchman
relationship is a dance of death.

03:44.486 --> 03:47.356
Okay, well, I'll mention
your progressive training

03:47.386 --> 03:49.526
when I present your case
to the Guild tonight.

03:49.556 --> 03:51.296
Tonight?
Tonight is date night.

03:51.326 --> 03:53.766
I told you a week ago
I'm gonna be on meteor majeure.

03:53.796 --> 03:56.666
- I can't ...
- Space meteor? Convenient excuse.

03:56.696 --> 03:59.296
I mean, if date night doesn't
mean that much to you...

03:59.336 --> 04:01.466
Oh, sweetness. If you
want me to cancel, I ...

04:01.506 --> 04:03.136
- No! Uh...
- Oh, no, it's cool.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.636
- Um, no, it's fine.
- We've got a lot to do.

04:04.676 --> 04:06.676
A-All right. That's my ride.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.476
You sure you don't want me to stay?

04:08.506 --> 04:10.776
Yeah, yeah, no, the Guild needs you.

04:10.816 --> 04:12.776
Don't ... Don't you worry about me.

04:12.816 --> 04:15.716
<i>Okay, sweetie.
I'll see you in a few days.</i>

04:15.756 --> 04:18.185
You may have spread that
frosting just a little thick.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.255
Yeah, Mr. Quick-think?
Maybe I should've danced with her, huh?

04:21.286 --> 04:23.726
I laid it on just thick enough.

04:23.756 --> 04:26.496
Ugh, I hate that she
works with that clown.

04:26.526 --> 04:29.826
<i>"I'm Phantom Limb.
Oh, don't mind if I touch your ass."</i>

04:29.866 --> 04:31.336
<i>That... dingus!</i>

04:31.366 --> 04:34.166
Bye-bye, you asshole.
I hate you, too.

04:35.506 --> 04:37.606
- All right, she's gone.
- To the Egg sac!

04:37.636 --> 04:41.276
- Ugh. See?
- Yeah, yeah. It does sound kind of "ew"-y.

04:41.306 --> 04:44.176
<i>Now, I'm sure you see
me as a lady-killer, Dean ...</i>

04:44.216 --> 04:46.276
a guy who knows his way around smooching

04:46.316 --> 04:48.646
and also touching
bathing-suit areas of women.

04:48.686 --> 04:50.416
No. Uh, not really.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.756
The sexual tiger-boy
you see is a ruse, Dean.

04:52.786 --> 04:56.226
Sure, I'll say it ... I have the
confident swagger of a bounder.

04:56.256 --> 04:57.856
Girls find me something of a mystery.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.296
- But I can't help that.
- What's your point, Hank?

05:00.326 --> 05:03.266
Okay, I have a date coming up,
and I don't wanna blow it.

05:03.336 --> 05:07.636
I need some advice on
how to, uh... satisfy?

05:07.706 --> 05:09.806
You're asking me?
I-I don't ...

05:09.836 --> 05:12.306
- W-Why don't you ask pop?
- I did. I learned nothing.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.246
Oh, no, wait.
I learned that he carries

05:14.276 --> 05:17.246
pamphlets on the dangers
of chlamydia in his wallet.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.476
The Whisper Washer!

05:19.516 --> 05:21.546
A completely silent washing machine.

05:21.586 --> 05:23.616
Pro ... silent washing machine.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.786
Con ... it's ... it's a washing machine.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.826
Yeah, no appliances.
Already went down that road.

05:28.856 --> 05:30.856
Dead end. Next.

05:30.896 --> 05:33.696
Behold, Shuffle Dynamism!

05:33.726 --> 05:35.866
<i>Pro ... free power in any building.</i>

05:35.896 --> 05:38.236
<i>Con ... everybody has
to wear magnetic booties</i>

05:38.266 --> 05:40.206
<i>and drag their feet on a special floor.</i>

05:40.236 --> 05:42.316
And it's very loud, and your lawyers

05:42.326 --> 05:44.406
informed me that it's
actually slave labor.

05:44.436 --> 05:46.676
- We can work around that.
- And it generates enough power

05:46.706 --> 05:50.546
- to run maybe a small pencil sharpener.
- Nice work, White. Billy?

05:52.616 --> 05:55.686
How many of you like to
kick back with a cold one?

05:55.716 --> 05:57.956
- Show of hands.
- Billy, this isn't the meadowlands.

05:57.986 --> 05:59.356
Sorry.

05:59.386 --> 06:00.786
The Prometheus Drug!

06:00.826 --> 06:02.726
The super-cool name is the first pro.

06:02.756 --> 06:05.656
The second pro is that
it can regenerate a liver.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.296
Well, now we're talking!

06:07.326 --> 06:10.796
Regrowing a liver? Billy!
Ka-Ching! Any cons?

06:10.836 --> 06:13.166
Oh, yeah. Sadly, after
it regenerates your liver,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.606
it just keeps making livers.
I got a bucket of mice

06:15.636 --> 06:17.536
that exploded from
growing multiple livers.

06:17.576 --> 06:20.206
You know, the real con
is that I'm getting sick

06:20.206 --> 06:22.846
- of blowing mice up.
- You guys, what do you have now?

06:22.876 --> 06:25.646
The conference is in days.
What works?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.386
Washing machine.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.286
God Gas. God Gas worked.

06:29.316 --> 06:31.286
God Gas?
I'm chubbing up already.

06:31.316 --> 06:33.826
Well, it's temporary
stimulation of the temporal lobe

06:33.856 --> 06:36.186
via a gas introduced
to the orbital cortex

06:36.226 --> 06:37.726
through the old factory connections.

06:37.756 --> 06:40.866
- So, you have...?
- A way to activate the temporal lobe

06:40.896 --> 06:43.496
into having pseudo-religious
visions, maybe?

06:43.536 --> 06:45.666
Or ... and don't act like
you haven't thought of this.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.536
- You know what I'm thinking.
- Yes. Okay, yes!

06:47.566 --> 06:49.366
It could be considered
that. But that's ...

06:49.406 --> 06:51.206
- Say it, Billy! Be a man!
- You're reaching!

06:51.236 --> 06:53.846
That's a praxis misapplication.
No way.

06:53.876 --> 06:56.246
What are you guys talking about?
What is it?

06:56.276 --> 06:58.376
<i>Mind-control Gas!</i>

06:58.416 --> 07:00.316
You guys are so cool sometimes.

07:00.346 --> 07:02.886
Mind-control Gas.
So good. Make it.

07:04.756 --> 07:07.186
Dude, what are you
doing in your geek cloak?

07:07.226 --> 07:09.656
- We got to paint the Egg Sac.
- Before you do,

07:09.696 --> 07:12.596
there's something down
there you must see... alone.

07:12.626 --> 07:16.266
- What's down there?
- Only what you take with you.

07:16.296 --> 07:18.796
Oka... all right, come on.
S-Show me this stupid thing.

07:18.836 --> 07:21.936
Your purple paint and brush!
You will not need them.

07:21.966 --> 07:24.436
This better be good.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.876
He has much anger in him,
like his father.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.916
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

07:32.946 --> 07:34.286
He is not ready.

07:38.586 --> 07:40.386
All right. What is this crap?

07:40.456 --> 07:42.956
<i>...scan head records</i>

07:42.996 --> 07:46.426
<i>as the tape whizzes by
at 7.5 inches per second,</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:49.426
<i>giving close to 200
lines of resolution ...</i>

07:49.466 --> 07:52.896
<i>all in a package so small,
it fits into your car's trunk.</i>

07:52.936 --> 07:55.636
<i>Astounding. With civilian
technology like that,</i>

07:55.666 --> 07:57.836
<i>we'll be out of a job soon.</i>

07:57.876 --> 08:00.546
<i>Well, you will.
I'm no super-scientist.</i>

08:00.576 --> 08:02.506
<i>You've read the papers.
I'm "unhinged."</i>

08:02.546 --> 08:04.516
<i>That's what I love about ya</i>

08:04.546 --> 08:06.676
<i>and what everybody hates about ya.</i>

08:06.716 --> 08:09.246
<i>"Vigilante!"
"Bad guy!"</i>

08:09.286 --> 08:11.516
<i>Ah, let 'em think what
they want. Whatever.</i>

08:11.556 --> 08:13.786
<i>Then I'm a bad guy.
Ha! There, I said it.</i>

08:13.826 --> 08:15.326
<i>Watch it there, blue baby.</i>

08:15.356 --> 08:17.726
<i>That's now on VTR tape.</i>

08:17.796 --> 08:21.826
<i>The Blue Morpho is a bad guy!</i>

08:21.866 --> 08:23.466
Unbelievable.

08:23.496 --> 08:24.736
<i>Wow, that's amazing!</i>

08:24.766 --> 08:26.396
Right?! I told you!

08:26.436 --> 08:27.986
<i>What's on the rest of this?</i>

08:27.986 --> 08:29.536
Oh, you do not wanna know!

08:29.576 --> 08:31.436
<i>Oh, yes, he does.</i>

08:31.476 --> 08:33.275
Oh, yes, I do!

08:34.446 --> 08:37.476
<i>Groovy!
Our arch enemies are here.</i>

08:37.515 --> 08:42.385
<i>Blue Morpho, it looks like some
evildoers have entered our lair.</i>

08:42.416 --> 08:43.986
<i>Oh, we're in for it now, Jonas.</i>

08:44.015 --> 08:49.856
- And they appear to have a growth ray!
- Go Team Venture.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.856
<i>Oh, my God!
They are not my mommy!</i>

08:52.896 --> 08:55.026
No! I-I am like 80% positive

08:55.066 --> 08:57.996
that is Jill St. John
and Stella Stevens.

09:03.936 --> 09:05.876
- Well, did it work?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

09:05.906 --> 09:08.276
How can you tell if a
mouse is prone to religious

09:08.276 --> 09:10.646
thinking or is
susceptible to suggestion?

09:10.676 --> 09:11.856
Why are we doing this?

09:11.856 --> 09:14.716
Well, to see if they die or grow
another head or something.

09:14.746 --> 09:17.056
I think that one's lonely.
Should you write that down?

09:17.086 --> 09:19.286
Uh, yeah, Dean, I'll just write down,

09:19.326 --> 09:22.056
"drug may cause loneliness
in mice." Anything else?

09:22.086 --> 09:24.856
Well, the one in the back might
be mad at that one over there.

09:24.896 --> 09:27.396
- They won't look at each other.
- Why are you down here?

09:27.426 --> 09:29.966
I don't have class till 1:30,
and Hank is following me around

09:29.996 --> 09:32.066
looking for advice on
how to score with women.

09:32.096 --> 09:34.406
Do you know anything about that?

09:34.436 --> 09:35.836
If I did, would I be down here?

09:35.876 --> 09:38.936
Okay, so, she's ready,
and I'm going in for the kiss.

09:38.976 --> 09:43.106
- Is it eyes closed or eyes open?
- Your eyes open, her eyes closed.

09:43.146 --> 09:45.646
- There's a little trick to that.
- What if I have to pee?

09:45.676 --> 09:48.816
Hank, let's just assume that
you have an empty bladder.

09:48.846 --> 09:52.616
Okay. "Use bathroom beforehand."

09:52.656 --> 09:54.656
"Make sure fly is up."

09:54.686 --> 09:56.956
All right.
So, I'm going in, eyes open.

09:56.996 --> 10:04.096
Just go in slow, like this...
like a cobra, ready to strike.

10:04.136 --> 10:08.706
- She'll close her eyes even if you don't.
- Oh, that is awesome!

10:08.736 --> 10:10.506
Cobra. Got it.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.006
What's up, Hatred?

10:12.036 --> 10:15.706
<i>We got a Code Green down here.
Backup requested.</i>

10:15.746 --> 10:17.546
"Code Green"?
Who's the hostage?

10:17.576 --> 10:20.496
That would be me.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.906
<i>21 comes back, I lose the cocoon,</i>

10:32.946 --> 10:36.046
I find the cave, my dad
might not be a good guy,

10:36.076 --> 10:37.976
and it all feels like it's meant to be.

10:38.016 --> 10:40.546
But then my wife wants me
to rise in the Guild ranks,

10:40.586 --> 10:42.786
and I don't want to
let her down, you know?

10:42.816 --> 10:45.456
You know, I'm not Mr. Feeny
from "Boy Meets World."

10:45.486 --> 10:47.686
I don't really care about this.
Do what you want.

10:47.726 --> 10:50.056
Wise advice.
But what do I want, Manolo?

10:50.096 --> 10:52.526
That is the ques...

10:52.556 --> 10:54.766
Hmm. Hold on.
Hi, sweetness.

10:54.796 --> 10:58.596
Baby, did you ever fill
out form 382-R like I asked?

10:58.636 --> 11:01.666
And you got to submit
the form dash 23 dash 82.

11:01.706 --> 11:03.166
It's an extension.

11:03.206 --> 11:06.576
<i>You can't do the normal one...
needs to be as an extension.</i>

11:06.606 --> 11:08.646
Yeah, I'll, uh ...
I'll fax those right to you.

11:08.676 --> 11:10.676
All right. Thanks, sweetie.
Just e-mail them.

11:10.716 --> 11:12.016
Okay, I gotta go.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.816
This isn't mine.
Whose suit is this?

11:14.846 --> 11:16.716
You're kidding me, right?

11:16.756 --> 11:19.886
Form 23 dash screw it.

11:19.926 --> 11:22.686
I'm the Blue Morpho!

11:22.726 --> 11:25.756
- Thank you, Manolo.
- S√≠. Whatever, Mr. Monarch.

11:25.796 --> 11:29.796
So wise, Manolo.
Whatever indeed.

11:29.836 --> 11:32.636
I am Haranguetan!

11:32.666 --> 11:36.906
I am here to bring the
unfortunate Dr. Venture pain!

11:36.936 --> 11:41.276
- Are you Dr. Venture?!
- I'm the guy between you and Dr. Venture.

11:41.306 --> 11:45.016
Now, why don't you let the old
man go and try to get by me?

11:45.046 --> 11:47.946
Oh, I accept your offer.
To your feet, old man!

11:47.986 --> 11:49.946
How old do you guys think I am?

11:49.986 --> 11:52.686
Look at the way you quake in fear,

11:52.716 --> 11:55.986
clinging to your final
days like a fat insect.

11:56.026 --> 12:00.496
Pathetic!
Now strike me!

12:06.966 --> 12:09.866
- It's not loaded.
- Neither is this.

12:09.906 --> 12:13.076
Strike me if you dare.

12:13.106 --> 12:16.206
Oh, please. I've wiped
bigger turds than you.

12:16.246 --> 12:19.846
- Let's see your moves.
- I smell your fear.

12:19.886 --> 12:21.846
Now, strike me!

12:23.186 --> 12:25.216
Ugh, little men.

12:25.256 --> 12:29.726
Just look at them.
Pyrois, Aethon, ride!

12:31.196 --> 12:33.226
- What are you waiting for?
- For you to strike me.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.826
<i>Let's go.
Make that last mistake.</i>

12:34.866 --> 12:36.266
Right here, as hard as you're able.

12:36.296 --> 12:38.666
You gonna stop talking,
take a swing, or what?

12:38.696 --> 12:40.036
Here it is laid before you.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.906
Strike me.
Strike me like a man.

12:42.936 --> 12:46.036
- What are you ... look, lady,
that was mine!  - Oh, please!

12:46.076 --> 12:48.706
You two would've been pissing
testosterone at each other

12:48.746 --> 12:50.716
till the cattle of Geryon came home.

12:50.746 --> 12:52.316
You can't just fly in and do that.

12:52.346 --> 12:54.146
There's, uh ... there's, like, a code.

12:54.186 --> 12:59.586
I heed not your bro code.
Justice has no gender.

12:59.616 --> 13:01.726
I'm pretty sure it's a
blind woman, actually.

13:01.756 --> 13:04.806
Oh, powerful Heracles,
do you wish to strike me?

13:04.806 --> 13:08.126
- You want to hit me, lady?
- Are you afraid to be felled by a woman?

13:08.166 --> 13:09.826
You afraid of a little man like me?

13:09.866 --> 13:11.896
- Oh, let's go.
- I'm right here!

13:13.266 --> 13:14.836
What are you doing?

13:14.866 --> 13:16.936
What do you mean?
I'm gonna paint these things

13:16.976 --> 13:18.676
to look like eggs.
I just gave up.

13:18.706 --> 13:20.136
The Egg sac. You win, dude.

13:20.176 --> 13:22.306
Put down the paint.
We're going with your idea.

13:22.346 --> 13:24.646
Really? Oh, you want
to pile all this crap up

13:24.676 --> 13:26.176
and climb it like the aggro-crag?

13:26.216 --> 13:30.346
No, no, the good idea.
Kano, it's time to suit up!

13:30.386 --> 13:33.786
Aw, hell yes, it is, Blue Morpho!

13:33.826 --> 13:37.726
<i>The new adventures
of Blue Morpho and Kano.</i>

13:37.756 --> 13:39.626
<i>The Monarch,
a down-and-out super-villain,</i>

13:39.656 --> 13:41.866
<i>claims his birthright
as the Blue Morpho,</i>

13:41.896 --> 13:44.066
<i>who may or may not be a good guy.</i>

13:44.096 --> 13:47.066
<i>Along with his faithful
bodyguard and chauffeur, Kano,</i>

13:47.106 --> 13:48.906
<i>who isn't actually an Asian.</i>

13:48.936 --> 13:50.906
<i>Their mission ... to beat up on villains</i>

13:50.936 --> 13:52.706
<i>that beat up on Dr. Venture</i>

13:52.736 --> 13:56.106
<i>till they alone beat up on Dr. Venture.</i>

13:56.146 --> 13:58.846
- This doesn't fit at all.
- Nope. Too roomy.

13:58.876 --> 14:00.646
<i>Using skills taught to him</i>

14:00.686 --> 14:03.086
<i>by his high-school home
economics teacher, Mrs. Althen,</i>

14:03.116 --> 14:06.116
<i>Kano makes key alterations
to their costumes.</i>

14:06.156 --> 14:07.956
Does it bunch up in the seat?

14:07.986 --> 14:09.626
- No, it's cool.
- Cool.

14:09.656 --> 14:11.626
To the Morpho Mobile!

14:27.206 --> 14:30.056
<i>Oh, Brock, there you are.</i>

14:30.066 --> 14:31.246
Okay, so, I've been thinking.

14:31.276 --> 14:33.676
Let's say she has on
a sports bra, right?

14:33.716 --> 14:36.186
No hooks! How can I get
one of those things off?

14:36.216 --> 14:38.986
You want to know what to do?
You do nothing.

14:39.016 --> 14:41.056
You just stand there like a jackass.

14:41.086 --> 14:44.126
Let her get right up in your
face, and just stand there.

14:44.156 --> 14:47.296
- And then let Hatred get hospitalized.
- Mm-hmm, right.

14:47.326 --> 14:51.096
Wait, is the hospital, like, a metaphor,
like, for kissing?

14:51.136 --> 14:52.936
Hank, I don't know!

14:52.966 --> 14:55.906
I don't know anything about
getting a woman to understand

14:55.936 --> 14:58.876
that her freaky muscles
and obnoxious personality

14:58.906 --> 15:02.396
are a huge turn-on,
and that all you wanna do

15:02.396 --> 15:05.676
- is bend her over and drive ...
- Okay! Okay! I get it!

15:05.716 --> 15:08.246
Only lady body-builders
use sports bras.

15:08.286 --> 15:09.646
Point taken.

15:09.686 --> 15:11.756
<i>Don't take the Lincoln Tunnel!</i>

15:11.786 --> 15:13.916
<i>It's rush hour!
Take the Triborough.</i>

15:13.956 --> 15:15.356
Idiot, that goes to Queens!

15:15.386 --> 15:17.696
I'm the chauffeur.
Let me... chauff.

15:17.756 --> 15:19.396
Then the George Washington or whatever.

15:19.426 --> 15:22.726
<i>Don't take the Lincoln Tunnel!</i>

15:25.136 --> 15:26.966
Yes, yes, beep at us.

15:27.006 --> 15:30.106
Beep at the car that can shoot
rockets from its trunk. Smart!

15:30.136 --> 15:32.306
Chill, chill.
Let's just go over our plan.

15:32.336 --> 15:35.046
Here's my plan. I'm gonna
rocket that tool behind us.

15:35.076 --> 15:36.906
All right, according to
Guild activity report,

15:36.946 --> 15:39.046
some guy named Haranguetan ...
good name ...

15:39.076 --> 15:41.716
is arching Venture all day,
so he's our mark.

15:41.746 --> 15:43.046
Sweet. He's a dead man.

15:43.086 --> 15:45.386
And they'll blame the Blue Morpho!

15:45.416 --> 15:48.426
Dude, you look like the Monarch
going to a "Mad Men" party.

15:48.456 --> 15:51.756
- You got to trim the beard.
- It took me 20 years to grow this!

15:51.796 --> 15:54.126
This is how they know
the Monarch is here!

15:54.166 --> 15:57.096
Yeah, exactly!
That's my exact point.

15:57.136 --> 15:59.766
Yeah, and these things have
gotten too trendy anyway.

15:59.796 --> 16:02.836
Give me your knife, will you?
I'll donate it to locks of love.

16:07.106 --> 16:08.906
<i>The effect lasts about an hour.</i>

16:08.946 --> 16:10.976
The subject will have
a heightened sense of awe

16:11.016 --> 16:14.316
- and, uh, religious visions.
- And? Come on, Billy.

16:14.346 --> 16:17.116
I need my Mind-control Gas.
Gotta have it.

16:17.156 --> 16:19.856
Okay, and be more
susceptible to suggestion.

16:19.886 --> 16:22.686
But hydrochloride as a dopamine
antagonist is really ...

16:22.726 --> 16:24.296
Blah, blah, blah, chemistry, blah.

16:24.326 --> 16:26.926
Check out my delivery system.
It looks like a cool gun

16:26.966 --> 16:29.866
and can shoot a blast of
that crap almost 15 feet.

16:29.896 --> 16:32.196
And it has the Ven-Tech
logo on the stock.

16:32.236 --> 16:34.236
Look, Doc, we really need more testing.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.986
The mice are, u-uh, on fire!

16:39.576 --> 16:42.246
I am so sick of killing mice!

16:42.276 --> 16:45.346
Nice. The conference
is in a couple days.

16:45.376 --> 16:48.116
We need to move on to human testing.

16:48.146 --> 16:50.286
Doc, be real. Where are
we gonna find someone

16:50.316 --> 16:52.516
willing to take an
untested mind-control drug?

16:54.456 --> 16:57.456
<i>Doc, just stay in the basement.
That Haranguetan guy is back.</i>

16:57.496 --> 16:59.056
<i>I'm gonna go pound his face in.</i>

16:59.096 --> 17:01.796
Just hold him there.
I need him.

17:01.826 --> 17:04.766
What? It's totally within the
rules of this kind of stuff.

17:04.796 --> 17:08.366
All right, we got to be quick!
Those parking meters are crazy.

17:08.406 --> 17:11.136
Right?
$3.50 an hour is outrageous!

17:13.205 --> 17:16.546
- Good, you didn't hurt him.
- No, I... I think his ribs.

17:16.576 --> 17:18.776
But, uh, no biggie.
What's going on?

17:18.816 --> 17:20.516
Just put him on the ground and back up.

17:20.546 --> 17:24.386
Billy is going to subdue him
with my new Mind-control Gas.

17:26.256 --> 17:27.786
I drew the short straw again.

17:27.826 --> 17:30.856
I'm, uh, sorry about this,
Mr. Haranguetan.

17:30.896 --> 17:33.296
Oh, God!

17:33.326 --> 17:35.366
Okay, that's not supposed to happen.

17:35.396 --> 17:38.036
White, you idiot!

17:38.066 --> 17:39.896
What was that?
What's happening?

17:39.936 --> 17:42.236
You are my slave.
You will do my bidding.

17:42.266 --> 17:43.836
I am your master.

17:43.876 --> 17:45.506
<i>You will do as I command.</i>

17:45.536 --> 17:49.606
<i>You are my slave,
and I your master.</i>

17:51.116 --> 17:53.146
Demon! Spawn of hell!

17:53.176 --> 17:56.916
- I cast you to oblivion!
- Please.

17:56.956 --> 17:59.986
<i>Save me, Rusty Venture, boy adventurer!</i>

18:00.026 --> 18:02.836
<i>Save me!</i>

18:04.296 --> 18:06.326
Brock? Get back here!

18:06.356 --> 18:08.096
I'm coming for you!

18:08.126 --> 18:10.166
- What the hell was that about?
- Who cares?

18:10.196 --> 18:12.596
Let's just do this before
that freak messes up Venture.

18:12.636 --> 18:14.236
Only I get to do that.

18:14.266 --> 18:17.266
Brock, come back!
There's a bad guy in my lobby!

18:17.306 --> 18:19.376
What is going on?

18:19.406 --> 18:23.376
Back into hell, demon spawn!

18:23.416 --> 18:27.516
Drop the little boy, Haranguetan,
or suffer the consequences.

18:27.546 --> 18:29.286
It's Blue Morpho and Kano

18:29.286 --> 18:32.486
<i>from the Rusty Venture show!
Save me!</i>

18:32.516 --> 18:35.856
Kano, use your... karate
stuff on him. Whatever.

18:42.626 --> 18:45.596
You're all safe now, little ...
uh, citizen.

18:45.636 --> 18:49.906
- And you can thank the Blue Morpho!
- Thank you, Blue Morpho.

18:49.936 --> 18:51.976
Wait. I recognize you.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.406
- I-I know who you are.
- No, you ... No, you don't.

18:54.446 --> 18:56.946
I'm the Blue Morpho.
Always been the Blue ...

18:56.976 --> 18:59.286
Kano, let's get the hell out of here!

19:03.046 --> 19:07.186
Dude, I'm like 90% sure
I just punched a guy to death.

19:07.226 --> 19:11.856
Your secret is safe
with me, Blue Morpho!

19:11.896 --> 19:15.566
My bodyguard is in there.
I'm not some punk. I'm Dr. Ven...

19:15.596 --> 19:17.466
Hey, hey, this is rayon. It rumples.

19:17.496 --> 19:20.136
Oh, yeah? Next time you
trespass on private property,

19:20.166 --> 19:22.566
wear something else.

19:22.606 --> 19:27.276
- Need a hand getting up, citizen?
- Oh, thank you. I was ...

19:27.306 --> 19:30.276
What the...
You can't be. No. You're ...

19:30.316 --> 19:33.976
The Blue Morpho!

19:34.016 --> 19:37.246
<i>Sir!
Sir, this is a restricted building.</i>

19:37.286 --> 19:40.316
I need to see an I.D.
You have to go, sir.

19:40.356 --> 19:41.556
You don't ...

19:46.156 --> 19:49.466
Oh, Heracles.
What an unwelcome surprise.

19:49.496 --> 19:51.636
And you brought me a corpse.
How thoughtful.

19:51.666 --> 19:55.166
Your beauty is your
strength, and I submit to it.

19:55.206 --> 19:58.436
Take me, and let me know what
it's like to be with a woman.

19:58.476 --> 20:01.206
There is nothing in
this world but your power

20:01.246 --> 20:04.406
and me, the only man who can see it.

20:04.446 --> 20:06.716
Let me worship at your altar.

20:06.746 --> 20:09.516
Let me know the
pleasure of a real woman.

20:12.056 --> 20:17.056
I'm gonna tire you out, brave Heracles.
Break you upon my wheel.

20:20.126 --> 20:22.326
- What was all that about?
- You're asking me?

20:22.366 --> 20:24.736
I hid in the corner till
all I could hear was Billy crying.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.596
Mind-control Gas, my ass.

20:26.636 --> 20:30.206
Now I have to unveil O.S. Sparkle Dream
at the Science Now conference.

20:30.236 --> 20:33.236
Or we could rename it!
You know, God Gas?

20:33.276 --> 20:35.176
Okay, yeah, that might work.

20:35.206 --> 20:38.276
But instead of a gun,
it could be an aspergillum!

20:38.316 --> 20:41.416
- Those little pope water-shaker things?
- Exactly!

20:41.446 --> 20:42.716
What are you doing?

20:42.746 --> 20:46.416
Nothing. And your
secret is safe with me...

20:46.456 --> 20:48.836
Blue Morpho.

21:18.586 --> 21:21.326
<i>That was the most fun I have ever had!</i>

21:21.356 --> 21:24.186
You called everybody "citizen"!
Classic!

21:24.226 --> 21:28.426
- Yeah, it sucks about the car, though.
- But that could've been avoided

21:28.466 --> 21:31.436
- if you'd just put more money in
the freakin' meter.  - I had nothing!

21:31.466 --> 21:35.236
This costume has like three
nickels from 1965 in the pocket.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.436
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry about it.

21:37.476 --> 21:41.276
Just bask in the glory
of us kicking ass.

21:41.306 --> 21:45.276
- Oh, look who's home.
- Oh! Uh, step, step...

21:45.316 --> 21:47.076
- Knock it off!
- Quick-quick, step... okay.

21:47.116 --> 21:51.256
I felt so bad that I missed date night
that I took the first shuttle back.

21:51.286 --> 21:53.316
And I come home to this.

21:53.356 --> 21:55.426
- Wait, now, n... I can explain!
- No need.

21:55.456 --> 21:58.326
- I know what's going on.
- No, there ...

21:58.356 --> 21:59.926
there's a good reason
we're dressed like this.

21:59.956 --> 22:03.026
I'm not an idiot, Monarch.
I know why you're in suits.

22:03.066 --> 22:04.936
<i>I know why you trimmed your beard.</i>

22:04.966 --> 22:08.436
You went out on date-night
with 21 to spite me.

22:08.466 --> 22:12.406
And... that's the reason!
Yeah, e-exactly that.

22:12.436 --> 22:16.426
I-I-I feel so ashamed, honey.

22:22.516 --> 22:23.906
Yeah!

22:24.305 --> 22:30.698
