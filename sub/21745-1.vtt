WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.337
You jerk.
It's not funny.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.339
Yes, it is.
Stop it!

00:05.373 --> 00:07.241
(running footsteps)
(door slams)

00:08.876 --> 00:10.744
(dog barking)

00:13.214 --> 00:16.984
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.622
(birds chirping,
dog barking in distance)

00:30.798 --> 00:32.800
(grunts softly)

00:34.868 --> 00:36.770
(sighs)

00:36.804 --> 00:38.038
(clicking)

00:46.414 --> 00:48.416
("What You Know"
by Esther Holt playing)

01:03.764 --> 01:06.300
* Darling

01:07.601 --> 01:11.605
* Darling, I've been told

01:14.642 --> 01:18.279
* Darling

01:18.312 --> 01:21.615
* Darling, you're so bold.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.651
(lighter clicking)

01:27.455 --> 01:29.457
(urinating)

01:32.360 --> 01:34.395
Hey, Jimmy!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.264
*

01:36.297 --> 01:38.299
(rooster crows)

01:45.139 --> 01:47.941
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:47.975 --> 01:50.678
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

01:50.711 --> 01:54.014
* Gonna leave you anyway.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.355
(cows mooing in distance)

02:08.028 --> 02:09.230
Thanks.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.468
*

02:14.502 --> 02:15.869
(doorbells jingle)

02:17.871 --> 02:19.840
How's that fence holding up?

02:19.873 --> 02:22.976
Fine, Jimmy.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.012
(engine roaring)

02:26.079 --> 02:27.681
(tires screeching)

02:30.017 --> 02:31.219
(chuckles)

02:33.554 --> 02:34.522
(door opens)

02:34.555 --> 02:35.656
(door closes)

02:44.164 --> 02:45.699
AUTOMATED VOICE:
At the sound of the tone,

02:45.733 --> 02:49.570
the time will be
2:58 and 30 seconds.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.405
(tone beeps)

02:51.439 --> 02:55.376
(banging)

03:14.094 --> 03:16.230
Mmm-mmm.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.765
Hey, Ringo.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.533
What episode are we on?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.101
JIMMY:
Uh, 15.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.903
(TV begins playing)

03:22.936 --> 03:24.772
Hey, did your power
go out last night?

03:24.805 --> 03:25.906
Nope.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.341
Mine did.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.277
It's back on now.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.711
Probably a loose hook-up.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.246
RAE (over TV):
So if you think this stunt

03:32.280 --> 03:34.081
is a little too dangerous,
then we can come up

03:34.114 --> 03:36.049
with something else.
COLT: We'll stick to the script.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.851
HOWIE: Yeah, Colt's right.
The only way we stand a chance

03:37.885 --> 03:40.588
of making a buck on this picture
is if we come in on budget.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.056
HARRY: The budget doesn't
matter; the world's waiting

03:43.090 --> 03:44.525
to see my script.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.560
HOWIE: Come on, Harry,
do you really think

03:46.594 --> 03:49.229
that the world is waiting to see
a low-budget flick called...
(knocking on door)

03:49.263 --> 03:50.431
HOWIE and HARRY:
Death Car Hookers.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.432
(Harry laughs)

03:51.465 --> 03:53.901
Goddamn it.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.404
HOWIE: Come on.
(Rae laughs)

03:56.437 --> 04:00.308
HARRY:
I rewrote the car wash scene, so
we do it outside and we save...

04:02.242 --> 04:03.544
Hey-ya, Burt.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.746
Uh-huh.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.616
We were just wondering if you
wanted to take a walk with us.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.584
A walk to where?

04:10.618 --> 04:13.287
Uh, just a little walk, for fun.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.324
The gas station's selling
something called boba tea.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.791
(laughs)

04:23.797 --> 04:25.232
(TV chatter resumes
indistinctly)

04:25.265 --> 04:27.501
(sighs)

04:27.535 --> 04:29.537
Goddamn old people.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.608
(chuckles)
That Fall Guy.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.247
* And you know, in your heart

04:40.280 --> 04:44.151
* There is no reason

04:44.184 --> 04:47.154
* He can no more
change your mind *

04:47.187 --> 04:51.124
* Than you can change a season

04:51.158 --> 04:53.093
* Oh

04:53.126 --> 04:55.863
* How long has it been

04:55.896 --> 04:58.999
* Since you said
good-bye to him? *

04:59.032 --> 05:02.269
* How long has it been?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.439
(music playing in distance)

05:05.473 --> 05:06.874
WOMAN:
Hey, Jimmy.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.677
Good set.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.978
I've never heard a guy

05:11.011 --> 05:12.513
do Meredith Brooks's
"Bitch" before.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.681
It was pretty cool.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.349
Mm-hmm.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.385
I read that book
you recommended,

05:17.418 --> 05:19.553
the Henning Mankell memoir.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.021
It was really affecting.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.956
Of course.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.959
Yeah, I'll give you some more
recommendations, if you like.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.528
Thanks.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.164
Hey, do you want to go
for a drive, or something?

05:31.198 --> 05:32.500
To where?

05:32.533 --> 05:36.003
Nowhere, just... for fun.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.408
I can't, but thank you.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.785
(tools whirring)

05:58.692 --> 06:01.729
(rock music playing,
quiet chatter)

06:01.762 --> 06:02.996
(doorbells jingle)

06:03.030 --> 06:04.331
Hey, Jimmy.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.566
Mm-hmm.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.802
(horn honking)

06:10.571 --> 06:13.106
MAN:
Slow down, Burt.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.948
A Sport and a Pastime
isn't in yet,

06:20.981 --> 06:22.349
but we can e-mail you.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.418
I don't have e-mail.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.754
Oh, well, we have SMS now.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.756
I don't have a cell phone.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.791
I'll check back.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.236
Ow.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.873
I swear,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.776
that Fall Guy.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.144
You know what
we should do, Ringo?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.146
Hmm?
When the weather gets
a little warmer,

06:53.180 --> 06:55.583
get one of those projectors,
watch Fall Guy

06:55.616 --> 06:58.151
on the side of my trailer,
under the stars.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.921
Mm. Great idea.
One more episode.

07:00.954 --> 07:01.989
I want to see if
Seavers is gonna land

07:02.022 --> 07:03.991
that Jet Ski
backflip.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.059
Ooh, they have fluffer-grahams.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.360
(chatter in distance)

07:12.633 --> 07:14.835
Hey-ya, Burt.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.670
What is this?

07:16.704 --> 07:19.673
GAIL: Oh, Clifford's kids
are visiting

07:19.707 --> 07:20.974
from New Hampshire.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.976
Say hi to Burt, family.
(others greet)

07:23.010 --> 07:24.311
Hey.

07:24.344 --> 07:28.248
Can I, uh, pour you
a glass of Chablis?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.785
Best boxed wine
money can buy.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.488
I guess.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.356
MAN: Don't get too close
to the fire, there.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.358
GAIL:
I was just about

07:38.391 --> 07:40.761
to play a song; I
hope you don't mind.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.362
Oh, God.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.397
Oh, hush, you old grump.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.371
* Oh, Danny boy

07:51.404 --> 07:53.874
* The pipes, the pipes

07:53.907 --> 07:55.976
* Are calling

07:56.009 --> 07:58.111
* From glen to glen

07:58.145 --> 08:02.850
* And down the mountainside

08:02.883 --> 08:04.618
* The summer's gone

08:04.652 --> 08:05.853
* And all the roses...

08:05.886 --> 08:07.621
Do you live here?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.389
* Falling...

08:09.422 --> 08:10.658
Why are you asking?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.560
This place is for old people.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
Is it?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.295
So why are you here?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.331
They had a vacancy. Go away.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.667
But this place
is for old people.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.802
This is getting very repetitive.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.070
Does your grandma live here?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.304
Oh, my God!

08:24.337 --> 08:26.473
My grandmother
doesn't live anywhere.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.475
He lives here.
Why do you live here?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.111
I'll tell you what, I...

08:33.080 --> 08:35.916
The entire point
of the United States

08:35.949 --> 08:38.518
is the guarantee of autonomy

08:38.552 --> 08:41.755
and personal liberty.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.657
What does that mean?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.659
It means

08:45.693 --> 08:50.363
it's none of
your goddamn business

08:50.397 --> 08:52.165
why he's living here.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.200
MAN:
Hey, now.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.267
Burt.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.036
You shut up.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.740
Clifford, control your family.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.509
Burt.
Ugh!

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
To hell with this.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.950
I'll have some more.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.585
Hey.

09:11.619 --> 09:15.388
That's a much better name
than "fluffer-grahams."

09:16.924 --> 09:18.558
(glass clinking)

09:18.592 --> 09:19.960
BURT:
Goddamn it.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.194
(metal clattering)

09:21.228 --> 09:23.230
Son of a...

09:25.298 --> 09:27.367
Would you please shut up?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.537
I lost my goddamn keys!
They're not on the hook!

09:30.570 --> 09:33.273
Oh. Well, then,
by all means, wake me

09:33.306 --> 09:35.042
from my erotic
slumber.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.544
Janis Joplin was just about
to go onstage.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.947
I always put them
on a goddamn key hook.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.381
But they're not there.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.050
Son of a gun,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.318
shit turd pile.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.192
(doorbells jingle,
quiet chatter)

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
We're on episode 22.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.604
Jesus, man, your memory.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.872
I don't want to watch.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.274
What? Did more
of your friends die?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.643
You think you'd be used
to it by now. Come on.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.878
It's a stupid show.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.681
What is he, a stuntman
or a crime fighter?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.983
Pick one. He's living a lie.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.484
Fine. Well, let's go
to the library

10:51.518 --> 10:53.153
and pick something else out.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.622
There's a, there's a little show
called Nash Bridges.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.657
I don't have my goddamn keys.

10:57.691 --> 11:01.361
How can we go to the library
if my keys are missing?

11:01.394 --> 11:04.531
What, and you think they'll
be in this box of old crap?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.533
I don't know.
I've looked everywhere.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.500
Goddamn.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.177
(chuckles)

11:17.210 --> 11:19.612
Me and Marty Szymanski.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.718
We rode motorcycles
across Australia in the '60s.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.855
A goddamn wallaby
made me lay down

11:27.888 --> 11:29.689
going 50.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.358
Fractured my tibia.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.760
(chuckles)

11:32.793 --> 11:35.228
It was a great trip.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.367
Right, library.
I'll drive.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.870
Fine, Ringo.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.839
But BMWs are for
lady travel agents.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.176
I'll lie down in back
so no one sees me.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.945
JIMMY:
House of Cards.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.547
A-Team. Wonderfalls. Deadwood.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.750
Takes place when
you were a child.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.386
Ugly Betty.
The Profiler.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.553
Yeah, you're right.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.355
The DVD selection
is pathetic here.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.624
But what do you expect
from a town whose tax money

12:04.657 --> 12:09.462
all goes to opioid treatment
and bark beetle eradication?

12:09.496 --> 12:10.931
We could drive into town.

12:14.968 --> 12:19.039
Why don't you just call a
locksmith to make you new keys?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.775
I'm not gonna pay someone
500 goddamn dollars

12:21.809 --> 12:24.377
to make a new key
for my own goddamn car.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.946
That's exactly what

12:25.979 --> 12:29.216
we don't need:
more garbage and confusion.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.151
Everything in this country

12:31.184 --> 12:32.786
is disposable!
Something goes wrong,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.321
throw it out!

12:34.354 --> 12:36.156
Drive to Walmart.
Buy a new one.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.892
You can't.
No keys. Burn.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.129
Chinese can make you another,
three cents on the dollar.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.897
Who cares if it's covered

12:43.931 --> 12:45.799
in dog dust and toxic paint?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.167
They're my keys,

12:47.200 --> 12:50.537
and I need to have my keys!

12:52.973 --> 12:55.175
Goddamn it!

12:57.878 --> 13:00.347
L.A. Law.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.489
Just get in.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.126
No. That car is all I have.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.528
What about you and Marty
whatever with the motorcycles?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.931
Marty died in 1997.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.200
No, I meant you have the photo.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.370
Burt?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.606
Burt. Burt!

13:26.639 --> 13:28.375
What are you...? B...

13:28.408 --> 13:30.710
Lunatic.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.182
Hello, Jimmy.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.483
Yeah.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.953
So, uh, how's Burt been
the last few days?

13:39.987 --> 13:41.688
Appalling.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.857
He's acting like a
little bitch, frankly.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.459
He threw a tantrum
and ran into the woods.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.028
He's probably dead
in a gulley by now.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.830
I was afraid of that.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.200
This must be
a big adjustment for him.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.169
I know how much
he loves that silly car.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.905
There's anything
you can do to help

13:57.938 --> 13:59.907
keep his mind off it
or cheer him up

13:59.940 --> 14:02.375
a little bit...
(clears throat)

14:03.543 --> 14:06.079
Listen.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.215
Can I confide in you, Jimmy?

14:08.248 --> 14:09.849
Please don't.
It's just that...

14:09.883 --> 14:10.918
Read the room, Gail.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.652
Even before you turned up,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.854
Burt had already been...

14:14.888 --> 14:18.158
well...

14:18.191 --> 14:20.928
we concluded it was best
if he didn't drive anymore,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.362
so I took his keys.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.932
I hate to deceive him,

14:24.965 --> 14:26.433
but he won't face reality.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.701
There are certain things
I can't do anymore.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.939
Bend down. Read without
a magnifying glass.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.373
Menstruate.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.209
The point is
you learn new things.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.845
Like, I'm learning HTML

14:38.878 --> 14:41.114
and glassblowing.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.782
I made this jellyfish.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.055
Anyway, I...

14:50.057 --> 14:52.259
We just care about him a lot.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.430
Thanks for keeping this
between us.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.467

Traffic Stopping, Death Splash"

15:33.200 --> 15:35.969

15:50.150 --> 15:54.721

Slow down! Slow down, Burt!

16:38.698 --> 16:39.999
Nope.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.142
BURT:
Yeehaw!

16:49.176 --> 16:50.143
(shouting)

16:50.177 --> 16:53.080
(car horn honking)

16:53.113 --> 16:54.247
Yeah.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.559
(sighs) That batty Gail,
thinking you wouldn't tell me.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.228
I should have
had her arrested.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.996
I still might.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.864
The one inalienable
right we all have

17:11.898 --> 17:13.866
is the right to
be left alone.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.570
It's sad, Jimmy;
these people, my peers,

17:17.604 --> 17:21.341
they used to be
robust, ballsy, young.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.611
Now they're these husks
huddled against what, death?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.913
So petrified of life

17:26.946 --> 17:29.282
that the minute they see
someone actually living,

17:29.316 --> 17:31.951
they have to shut it down
so it doesn't remind them

17:31.984 --> 17:33.853
they gave up years ago.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.855
Right. Now we can
finally get back to it.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.690
L.A. Law.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.628
It's a bit dated, but there's
a satisfying Albee-esque bite,

17:41.661 --> 17:45.232
if you can see past the
mullets and baggy suits.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.901
Being without my car
made me feel...

17:48.935 --> 17:51.804
(chuckles)
...I felt old.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.640
Like them.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.775
So, I'm hitting the road.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.377
What?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.779
I used to live
in Cape Coral.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.482
I figure I'll drive down,
see how it's changed,

18:02.515 --> 18:05.652
and visit some of
my old buddies from the Navy

18:05.685 --> 18:09.322
down in the Keys,
if any of them are still alive.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.992
I'm talking five, six days
to get down there,

18:13.025 --> 18:15.628
just me and the open road.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.797
Are you seriously leaving?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.632
Don't cry, Ringo.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.834
You can watch L.A. whatever
without me.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.504
The thing is...

18:24.537 --> 18:29.276
yes, Gail has terrible
taste in lawn ornaments

18:29.309 --> 18:31.077
and literature

18:31.110 --> 18:36.349
and jogging attire,
but maybe she has a point?

18:36.383 --> 18:40.620
You ran over my hibachi
three times, man.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.355
No, I didn't.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.858
What? Okay, well, yes, you did,
first of all.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.860
That is disturbing
that you deny it.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.462
But listen, Burt,

18:49.496 --> 18:51.331
right, I'm not gonna talk
down to you, okay?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.499
You are an adult.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.801
My God, it's pathetic for anyone

18:54.834 --> 18:56.336
to live in anything
but the truth.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.271
Okay? And your truth

18:58.305 --> 19:01.841
is, Burt, you are no longer
a driver.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.176
I-I used to
find it amusing.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.111
Old man in a hot rod.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.847
But Gail's right.
You are dangerous.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.982
No, I'm not.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.853
And even if you make it to
Florida, you're gonna be alone.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.456
I like being alone.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.226
Burt, you have people
here who care about you.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.461
Out there, zero.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.630
Just... live in
reality, man.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
You're serious?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.834
You've been hiding out

19:27.867 --> 19:31.204
in a retirement community
where your only friend

19:31.238 --> 19:35.141
is a 71-year-old
who can barely stand you.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.377
It's been three months.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.547
You ever wonder why I never
asked what you're hiding from?

19:40.580 --> 19:44.584
Because it's none of
my goddamn business!

19:44.617 --> 19:47.220
But you might want to ask
yourself that question

19:47.254 --> 19:50.390
before you try
to interfere in my life.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.993
You're only 71?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928

19:55.962 --> 19:58.431
What were you? A Nepali Sherpa?

19:58.465 --> 20:00.267

You look like

20:00.300 --> 20:02.101
a boat dock came to life.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.570
Remind me to moisturize

20:03.603 --> 20:05.438
next time.
