WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.752
[operatic music playing]

00:10.593 --> 00:11.761
Choke me a little.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.513
I like it.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.733
[gasping]

01:00.018 --> 01:04.522
Weecha, if Mierce is able to read me,
are you able to read her?

01:05.106 --> 01:07.609
-[Weecha] I don't.
-You don't or can't?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.074
Looking for Elizabeth's killer.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.534
This compulsion is--

01:17.744 --> 01:19.120
I don't blame her for leaving.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.165
Mierce didn't leave
because of what you are doing.

01:23.291 --> 01:27.962
She left because what you are doing
has revealed you to be a different man

01:28.046 --> 01:30.840
from the one you were with her
in our home on the mountain.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.888
When this is done and I'm that man again,

01:36.971 --> 01:39.224
will your sister take me back?

01:39.307 --> 01:42.018
Is that man still in there somewhere?

01:42.101 --> 01:43.061
[knocking on door]

01:44.312 --> 01:46.022
That'll be Harold.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153
I thought you had a case.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.113
I do.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.489
And a funeral.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.033
Once I give you one,
I'm going to the other.

01:57.117 --> 01:57.951
I'm sorry.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.953
Your friend, were the two of you close?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.204
We were.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.957
We worked together quite often
over the years.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.834
He was a good man.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.379
Speaking of the dearly departed,

02:09.462 --> 02:11.464
Ambassador Warren

02:11.548 --> 02:16.511
was found dead after shaking the sheets
with someone other than his better half.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.098
The obit says he was a beloved
family man who was murdered in his home.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.308
High gloss to cover a low truth.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.145
This says MPD has no leads.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.982
That's because they're not intimately
acquainted with Fredrica Carrellas,

02:29.065 --> 02:32.277
madam to the affluent and influential.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.237
-And you are?
-Naturally.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.864
She has information.

02:35.947 --> 02:36.948
Secrets.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.408
Large and small.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.077
-And the ambassador was her client?
-Until recently.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.581
Apparently, he informed her that he was
closing his account

02:44.664 --> 02:47.417
and availing himself of new pleasures.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.043
How is that relevant to his death?

02:49.127 --> 02:53.840
Well, he was availing himself
on or around the time that he expired.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.508
This new service.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.843
You have its name?

02:56.926 --> 02:59.095
[Aram] Nothing came up
under the name "Genuine Models."

02:59.178 --> 03:00.221
Offline or on.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.682
I guess the rich and powerful
don't scratch this itch

03:02.765 --> 03:04.767
from the back pages
of alternative weeklies

03:04.851 --> 03:06.060
or search engines.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.105
Is this something
we're actually gonna investigate?

03:09.188 --> 03:12.567
Reddington wanting us to protect
a madam he consorts with?

03:12.650 --> 03:15.445
Look into it. If it turns out
to be a goose chase,

03:15.528 --> 03:17.322
we'll pass it off to Metro PD.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.656
Bring Madame Carrellas in

03:18.740 --> 03:21.367
and look under the hood
of the ambassador's murder.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.080
As for Genuine Models, keep digging.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.166
I'm not good.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.918
I am great.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.754
Sorry to say, but that's a fact.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.215
One I sincerely hope
you're about to demonstrate.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.175
Bartender spikes your drink.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.010
You go sideways,

03:39.093 --> 03:41.804
wake up and are framed
for killing your wife's lover.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.766
Work upstream to the bartender.
He gets whacked.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.143
Woman friend of said bartender goes AWOL.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.564
All leads DOA, until they're not.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.358
-You found the friend.
-I did.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.235
Let's hold off on the applause

03:55.318 --> 03:57.237
and make sure that we get to her

03:57.320 --> 04:00.490
before the pathologically persistent
Detective Heber.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.532
Where exactly is she?

04:01.616 --> 04:05.036
In a dive bar
in Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.621
Her ex-girlfriend owns the joint.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.832
She used to tend bar there
until they broke up and moved up to D.C.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.044
I hesitate to bring another
innocent person into this.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.129
This woman was already at risk.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.049
She could be the piece of the puzzle
that gets you off the hook

04:18.132 --> 04:19.842
for Doug Koster's killing.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.931
[Carrellas] What was so urgent I needed
to be pulled out of my Pilates session?

04:25.014 --> 04:27.850
As you know, being limber
is a job requirement.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.851
I didn't, actually.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.104
But now that you mention it,
I can imagine--

04:31.187 --> 04:33.356
Yes, I'm sure you can.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.942
Ambassador Warren.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.361
Dan was a good friend.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.905
-And a client.
-He was a client and a good friend.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.907
I introduced him to his wife.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.826
Well, I'm sure she's eternally grateful.

04:44.909 --> 04:50.081
Not all relationships are as conventional
as you might assume, Agent--?

04:50.164 --> 04:51.082
Ressler.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.460
Well, Agent Ressler...

04:54.544 --> 04:56.629
you can pin me down any time.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.632
We're looking into the connection
between the ambassador

04:59.716 --> 05:01.884
and an escort service
called Genuine Models.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.595
We need to know anything
that you can share.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.432
None of my girls
have been headhunted by Genuine.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.433
Which is odd.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.394
And I can't trace a single contact,
not a name, address,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.896
nothing about Genuine Models.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.941
Whoever's behind it is deep underground.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.151
These men.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.030
These awful, terrible men.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.198
Sucking everything around them dry.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.910
They use and they abuse,

05:27.994 --> 05:31.706
acting like the world
is their personal playground.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.297
Don't be sad, dear one.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.132
These men,

05:41.215 --> 05:43.843
they might be used
to getting what they want.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.762
But now, thanks to us...

05:46.471 --> 05:49.390
they're finally going to get
what they deserve.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.852
Usually when these new
escort services pop up,

05:52.935 --> 05:55.104
some of my girls leave to work for them.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.899
Then a few months later,
they come running back

05:57.982 --> 06:01.152
because nobody treats them better
than Mama Carrellas.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.822
You think Genuine Models is offering
something standard escort services do not?

06:04.906 --> 06:05.782
I don't know.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.243
But a second client just told me
he's moving on.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.620
I worry it's to Genuine

06:10.703 --> 06:14.123
since he was originally introduced
to me by the ambassador.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.374
What's his name?

06:16.209 --> 06:20.463
We can't ensure your client's
not in danger unless we know who he is.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.300
Congressman Spate.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.219
<i>Matt Spate.</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:39.398
[Raymond] Listen, you just give me a call

06:39.482 --> 06:43.277
when you're ready
for a proper insurance policy

06:43.361 --> 06:46.739
for you and that
bungee-jumping wife of yours.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.783
Steve Homan, rhymes with showman.

06:48.866 --> 06:49.784
Will do, Steve.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.161
You know, in my line of work
as a divorce attorney,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.956
what you call insurance, we call a prenup.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.130
Fancy seeing you here.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.173
Steve Homan, is it?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.758
Cassandra.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.510
Looking lovely as ever.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.221
You're not so bad yourself, Raymond.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.765
Hmm. Cassandra,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.475
this is Weecha Xiu.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.020
Weecha, an old friend, Cassandra Bianchi.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.897
Well, hopefully not that old.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.358
It's so sad about Barney.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.026
He was such a good man.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.862
With the rarest of qualities.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.198
Complete, unfettered honesty.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.409
There was no guile about Barney,

07:31.492 --> 07:32.952
and in our business,

07:33.035 --> 07:34.454
that can be a problem.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.414
And what business is that?

07:37.498 --> 07:40.001
I take things that aren't mine.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.169
Some years back,

07:41.252 --> 07:43.504
I persuaded Mr. Homan the Showman

07:43.588 --> 07:46.966
to rob a Middle Eastern
arms dealer with me.

07:47.049 --> 07:50.553
Among the items we boosted
was this invaluable necklace

07:50.636 --> 07:55.057
the arms dealer was going to give
his wife for her birthday.

07:55.141 --> 07:59.729
The only person in the world
we trusted to fence it was Barney.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.898
But before he could find a buyer,

08:01.981 --> 08:06.736
the item was stolen from the safe
at Barney's collectibles store.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.405
It was never found.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.991
[Weecha] Was it a ruby necklace?

08:12.074 --> 08:15.786
Yes. The largest ruby
ever unearthed in Myanmar.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.039
How could you possibly know that?

08:18.122 --> 08:20.041
Because I'm looking right at it.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.429
I'm sorry, I don't think we've met.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.680
I'm Matilda.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.140
I'm Barney's wife.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.058
Widow.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.102
I hate saying that.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.188
I'm Steven Homan,

08:42.271 --> 08:44.857
an old friend of your husband's.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.110
I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.530
Barney was a dear man.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.532
Lillian Alexander.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.618
We both adored Barney so much.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.496
How did you know my sweet Barney?

08:58.579 --> 09:00.206
Collectibles.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.251
Acquiring, trading
and selling valuable items.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.794
It's a tricky business.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.464
And your husband
was a prince among thieves.

09:08.548 --> 09:13.386
Matilda, I can't help but ask
about your necklace.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.931
It's possibly the most stunning piece
of jewelry I've ever seen.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.474
Oh, yes.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.686
Thank you.
This is my most valued possession.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.981
It was a gift from Barney
for our anniversary.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.651
I love that I can carry this piece of him
over my heart.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.156
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

09:36.367 --> 09:40.871
Apparently, Barney used me
to do his dirty work for him.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.999
What do you mean?

09:43.499 --> 09:46.544
Barney told me it was Peter Finchy
who stole the necklace.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.505
Barney's business partner.
He went missing around that time, no?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.382
After the necklace was stolen,

09:51.465 --> 09:54.093
Barney told me he'd discovered
some secret storage locker

09:54.176 --> 09:56.262
that Peter had been hiding
from him for years.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.307
A locker that contained
several of the items

09:59.390 --> 10:01.183
taken when the store was robbed.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.061
And Peter Finchy didn't just disappear.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.105
I banished him to Nunavut.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.067
So Peter didn't betray Barney.
It was the other way around.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.528
With Finchy out of the picture,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.114
Barney got the business
and all the spoils.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.450
Including our necklace.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.368
I need a stiffer drink.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.582
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess
we arrived a little too late.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.834
I don't know where
the Incredible Hulk's been,

10:26.917 --> 10:28.961
but check his alibi.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.131
Whoever strangled him
did so with unusual force.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.842
He's gotta leave some DNA behind.

10:34.925 --> 10:39.347
You'd think so, but I haven't been able to
collect sweat or skin cells from his neck.

10:39.430 --> 10:44.602
Look at this. The handprint and
bruising patterns are strangely uniform.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.313
You'd expect it to be
more haphazard with a struggle.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.148
Maybe he didn't have time to fight.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.734
Doesn't seem to be
any surveillance on the property.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.736
That's not gonna help us find the killer.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.946
Maybe this will.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.619
If we can get a DNA hit off that hair,
we'll find our murderer.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.043
I know you're having second thoughts.

11:09.710 --> 11:13.005
Of course.
You have empathy, you're a good person.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.466
It's one of the many reasons I love you.

11:16.092 --> 11:22.431
But I promise, even if it feels wrong now,
we're doing the right thing.

11:28.687 --> 11:33.150
You believe in me, right? In us?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.653
I will always believe in you.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.746
[Cooper] Miss Grant, we need information

11:45.830 --> 11:48.707
on your bartender friend
who was murdered in D.C.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.792
Abel Judge?

11:50.918 --> 11:53.546
-I don't know what you're referring to.
-[Sloan] I think you do.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.841
You blew town awful quick
the morning after Abel was killed.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.719
I can't have anything to do with this.
Please, leave me alone.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.513
I'm afraid we can't do that.

12:05.933 --> 12:11.147
Okay, yes.
I left town right after Abel was killed.

12:11.230 --> 12:15.109
Did you know he spiked a customer's drink
a few nights before he was killed?

12:16.485 --> 12:20.364
No, I told you all I have.
I'm sorry. I have to get back to work.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.284
Miss Grant. Please. Please, Miss Grant.

12:24.076 --> 12:28.164
The man whose drink Abel spiked is
being framed for something he didn't do.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.126
If there's anything you know,
if you could tell us,

12:32.209 --> 12:35.504
then you'd not only help
to get justice for your friend,

12:35.588 --> 12:39.258
but also for this man,
whose life is hanging in the balance.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.887
Here's my number.
Call it anytime, day or night.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.478
Cassandra.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.231
-You're leaving?
-Barney's dead. I've been played.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.068
And the widow is wearing $3 million worth
of rubies that belongs to us.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.695
None of this is her fault.

12:59.778 --> 13:03.657
Matilda loved Barney
and treasures the necklace he gave her.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.285
Taking it would only add insult to injury.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.829
-Look at you, rising above.
-[chuckles]

13:09.622 --> 13:12.583
Hmm. I find that annoyingly winsome.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.252
Fine. We can leave it be.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.381
Can we at least commiserate over dinner?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.510
I doubt I would be
much of a conversationalist.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.346
Who said we had to talk? Or eat?

13:26.597 --> 13:30.809
Cassandra, I'm involved. Or trying to be.

13:30.893 --> 13:36.357
Wow. Screwed by two men in the same day
with none of the fun part.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.192
Definitely time to go home.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.745
Ambassador Warren's financials are clean.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.706
Ditto Congressman Spate.
But check this out.

13:52.790 --> 13:58.212
Both of them wired $250,000 to a company
called Smith Provençal Antiques

13:58.295 --> 14:00.089
the day before they were both killed.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.341
I doubt they were
buying 19th-Century armoires.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.301
Maybe it's a front for Genuine Models.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.805
We got a hit on the strands of hair
in Matt Spate's hand.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.058
A Darlene Wozniak of Arlington, Virginia.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.227
She's a nurse at County.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.771
A nurse that moonlights
as a serial-killing prostitute?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.106
How does that make sense?

14:17.189 --> 14:19.942
By bringing her in and questioning her.
Come on, let's go.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.576
-Steven! Come in!
-Thank you, Matilda.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.871
How lovely to see you again!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.747
I was on my way to the airport

14:33.831 --> 14:37.960
and realized I couldn't leave
without offering a final condolence.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.128
Chicken pot pie.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.923
One can never have
enough food on hand in times of grief.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.302
I just put some coffee on.
Do you have time for a cup?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.470
I always have time for a cup.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.430
Good.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.601
I gotta say, I'm taken
by how loyal Barney's friends are.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.102
-Friends?
-Yeah.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.900
Lillian stopped by
on her way out of town too.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.321
Barney used to say that
the world of collectibles was dog-eat-dog.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.199
But you both have been so thoughtful.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.913
Oh, here, sit down, relax.
Oh, I'll go get your coffee.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.753
So much for rising above.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.088
You thought that I was winsome.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.134
Annoyingly winsome.
Now I just find it and you annoying.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.095
What happened
to not adding insult to injury?

15:30.179 --> 15:34.558
I recalculated.
My injury was far greater than her insult.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.145
I do love you, Raymond,
but I think I love to hate you more.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.148
You may have just written my epitaph.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.525
Aw.

15:44.526 --> 15:50.199
Matilda, oh, smells delicious.
Could you point me to the powder room?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.951
Third door, down the hall.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.874
We want you to know whatever
you say is completely confidential.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.752
So tell us about Abel.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.170
He was a good person.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.924
He supported his sick mom
and younger sister.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.761
Every once in a while he would deal drugs
to make extra cash.

16:10.844 --> 16:14.640
One night, a guy came in
and asked for some pills.

16:15.140 --> 16:20.980
Abel met him out back, and the guy
turned out to be some kind of detective.

16:21.063 --> 16:26.443
A detective? Did Abel tell you
his name or who he worked for?

16:26.527 --> 16:30.447
No. Only that the cop
threatened to arrest him for dealing.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.950
Unless he agreed to dose the man's drink.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.743
[Everly]
He didn't see how he had a choice.

16:36.245 --> 16:40.249
The worst part is
I'm the reason he was murdered.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.376
What do you mean?

16:42.459 --> 16:44.294
After he told me the story,

16:44.378 --> 16:47.881
I convinced him
to go to the police and say what happened.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.135
And the next day he was dead.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.220
It's not your fault.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.557
-How would you know that?
-Because it's mine.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.935
I'm the person whose drink he dosed.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.979
I don't know why he was asked to,

17:02.062 --> 17:05.190
but when I started asking questions,
Abel was killed.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.234
That's on me, not you.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.738
I'm scared.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.823
That's why I split.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.368
Anything else you can remember
that Abel told you about the detective?

17:16.452 --> 17:19.538
-What he looked like, his age.
-Nothing like that.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.958
He did notice something
about the guy's badge.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.295
Which sounds weird,
but Abel had this eagle tattoo,

17:26.378 --> 17:30.132
he had this thing for eagles,
and the badge, he said it was cool

17:30.215 --> 17:33.635
because it had two figures
and an eagle on it.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.932
This is crazy.
Y'all must have made some mistake.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.477
The only mistake is you pretending
not to know anything

17:41.560 --> 17:43.687
about the murder of Congressman Spate.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.314
Your hair was found in his hand.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.524
You keep saying that,
and I keep telling you

17:47.608 --> 17:51.320
I never met the man
or any other politician.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.655
-What about Ambassador Warren?
-What about him?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.492
Two murdered men,
strangled to death in their bed.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.245
Is that what y'all think I do?
Choke out guys I have sex with?

18:00.621 --> 18:04.583
I work the graveyard shift
in the Oncology wing.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.460
I have not had sex in two years.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.797
And that was with a diesel mechanic,
not a congressman.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.174
Tell us about Genuine Models.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.468
You know, it's funny you should ask.

18:14.551 --> 18:17.221
They called to see
if I could do a bikini shoot in Cancun,

18:17.304 --> 18:20.682
and I was gonna go,
but I had some bed pans to empty.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.810
Make light of it all you want.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.604
You say you weren't there,
but your hair was.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.398
-How do you explain that?
-I can't.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.820
Oh, my God. Wait.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.531
My hair. All right.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.783
A year ago, I got behind on my rent,

18:37.866 --> 18:42.121
and my friend Bonnie told me about
this wig company that pays for hair.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.374
So I chopped off my ponytail,
popped it in the mail,

18:45.457 --> 18:49.044
and a few days later, a check came.
It's for 500 bucks.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.005
The address you sent your hair to,
we're going to need it.

18:52.506 --> 18:57.386
He had so many plans, you know?
He wanted to travel, learn how to fly.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.930
He was so full of energy.

19:00.013 --> 19:04.977
Oh, my gosh.
Barney was full of so many things.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.020
Generosity, for instance.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.858
That necklace he gave you,
what a breathtaking gift.

19:10.941 --> 19:15.696
I wonder if it would be too much
of an imposition to see it one more time?

19:15.779 --> 19:19.700
Beholding a piece that exquisite
is a rare treat.

19:19.783 --> 19:23.537
No imposition at all,
but I don't want you to miss your plane.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.039
Oh, I'm not worried about my plane.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.292
Well, I should be off.

19:28.375 --> 19:34.173
Nonsense! Matilda's just about to show us
that magnificent necklace Barney gave her.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.425
-Is she?
-I'll be right back.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.847
Fine, 50-50.

19:41.930 --> 19:47.853
Seventy-30, or I tell dear Matilda that
her precious pendant is in your handbag.

19:47.936 --> 19:52.149
Does this woman you want to be
involved with know you're a scoundrel?

19:52.232 --> 19:53.066
She does.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.527
No doubt
you're convincing her you can reform.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.987
Poor woman.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.239
-Sixty-40.
-Fifty-five-45.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.949
I can't reform that much.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.702
[Matilda] My necklace. It's gone.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.162
Fine.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.332
I'm sure it's here somewhere, Matilda.

20:08.415 --> 20:12.002
We'll help you look.
You start in the bedroom and bathrooms,

20:12.085 --> 20:16.715
and we'll search out here,
no stone left unturned.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.217
[phone ringing]

20:19.760 --> 20:20.969
I need to take this.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.389
I'll circle back soon as I get
Ms. Grant safely situated.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.145
-[Cooper] <i>Agent Park. Where are we?</i>
-Wozniak wasn't involved.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
The hair found? She'd sold it.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.692
We got the address.
Dembe and I are headed there now.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.277
<i>Excellent. Anything else?</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.446
A wire to Smith Antiques was flagged.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.658
Another $250,000 from Billy Burton,

20:42.741 --> 20:44.785
a restauranteur in Philadelphia.

20:44.868 --> 20:48.163
We know where this leads.
Aram, Park, get there now.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.290
Well, well. Harold Cooper.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.416
Detective Heber.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.044
Everly Grant.
I'm not gonna find her, am I?

20:54.127 --> 20:56.463
I recommend the nachos. Delicious.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.048
Doug Koster dies.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.469
The bartender who served you
the night of the murder also dies.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.305
The only one who might know why he died--

21:06.014 --> 21:07.683
you get to her before I do.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.519
On the other hand, the disco fries

21:10.602 --> 21:11.770
are irresistible.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.438
Two counts of murder.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.649
Now witness tampering.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.609
You looked like the suspect.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.153
I never thought you'd be
stupid enough to act like one.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.951
[rock music playing]

21:31.039 --> 21:32.874
Mr. Burton. FBI.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.760
Mr. Burton? It's the FBI.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.554
[Burton gasping]

21:54.521 --> 21:56.315
Hands up. Now!

22:05.198 --> 22:07.242
Uh, Agent Park.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.618
-You got her?
-[Aram] No.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.122
But, um, I got it.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.592
[Cassandra] Of all the ridiculous capers
we've gotten into,

22:23.675 --> 22:26.053
this is approaching the most ridiculous.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.472
Pretending to look
for a necklace we're stealing.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.932
We can't steal what belongs to us.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.019
What we can do is help a grieving widow

22:34.102 --> 22:37.022
feel as if she's not alone in the world.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.734
And after we finish pretending
to find dear Barney's gift,

22:40.817 --> 22:41.777
then what?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.111
Pretending?

22:45.781 --> 22:48.575
-How long has she been there?
-Long enough.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.496
I may be old, but I'm not stupid.

22:52.579 --> 22:56.124
I know I put that necklace in the safe.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.960
Then you two show up, sweet as can be.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.839
I want it back now,
or I'll call the police.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.222
-You don't want to do that.
-Why not?

23:10.305 --> 23:14.601
Because we'd have to tell the police
the truth about your beloved Barney.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.686
What truth?

23:23.193 --> 23:24.111
May I help you?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.488
Agents Ressler and Zuma. FBI.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.073
What took you so long?

23:28.156 --> 23:29.366
You're expecting us?

23:29.449 --> 23:32.119
I called the authorities.
Isn't that why you're here?

23:32.202 --> 23:34.496
We're looking for a wig manufacturer.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.874
We don't make wigs,
but we do use human hair

23:37.958 --> 23:39.793
on the robot companions we create here.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.671
Companions? I think you mean sex robots

23:42.754 --> 23:44.172
who killed people who use them.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.841
You must mean Chrissy?

23:45.924 --> 23:47.050
Who is Chrissy?

23:47.134 --> 23:49.928
Chrissy is one of Genuine's
most popular models.

23:50.011 --> 23:53.140
So you knew your robots
were killing your customers?

23:53.223 --> 23:54.808
That's why you called?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.143
No. I didn't know.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.145
Are we sure that's even the case?

23:58.228 --> 24:00.689
I called the police because after I read

24:00.772 --> 24:03.483
that Ambassador Warren was dead,
I didn't think much of it--

24:03.567 --> 24:05.944
besides that it was a terrible tragedy.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.947
I certainly didn't connect
the dots back to us.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.491
Then I read Congressman Spate's
also found dead,

24:11.575 --> 24:13.410
I couldn't help but make the connection,

24:13.493 --> 24:15.829
they both purchased a Chrissy model.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.039
We've suspended sales of the model

24:18.123 --> 24:20.709
until we can figure out
what's going wrong. If anything.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.043
Something's wrong.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.297
Our colleagues intercepted another
murder-in-progress in Philadelphia.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.339
What?

24:27.007 --> 24:30.051
Oh, my God. Oh, Billy Burton.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.972
Um, he just purchased a Chrissy model
last month. Is he okay?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.891
He's fine. A little bruised.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.768
What's turning Chrissy murderous?

24:38.852 --> 24:40.896
We're not sure.
I've been going over the code,

24:40.979 --> 24:43.481
trying to figure out
what might have gone wrong.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.736
I still find it highly unlikely that
these precisely-tuned machines

24:47.819 --> 24:49.654
have malfunctioned in any way.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.907
It's really difficult to teach

24:51.990 --> 24:54.910
a robot what is too much force
to use with humans.

24:54.993 --> 24:58.997
Whether it's for physical therapy,
playing games, or sexual intimacy.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.791
You're knowingly selling
potentially lethal robot escorts.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.960
No. Nothing like this
has ever happened before,

25:04.044 --> 25:07.255
not in beta-testing,
not since we sold our first model.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.590
They're not escorts.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.134
These are uncommonly sophisticated,

25:11.218 --> 25:15.055
quality-of-life enhancing,
AI-based companion robots.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.724
-Who have sex with your customers.
-In some cases, yes.

25:17.807 --> 25:22.229
Look, everything we do in life
intersects with the inanimate.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.814
For years,
technology has been anticipating

25:24.898 --> 25:26.316
what we want and providing it.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.027
Not to mention,
real women can get pregnant,

25:29.110 --> 25:30.904
they can blackmail you, sue you.

25:30.987 --> 25:34.241
You can fall in love with them
and be tempted to blow up your life.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.410
All these messes
that robots can't and won't make.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.038
What you call messes,
most people call life.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.791
We need to see a list of your customers.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.127
Starting with everybody who purchased
a Chrissy model from you.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.379
Okay.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.050
I don't believe it.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.179
I can't believe that Barney could be a--
what did you call that? A rail?

25:56.263 --> 25:58.640
A fence. A trafficker in stolen goods.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.559
Some of which we stole.
Including the necklace.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.895
Which he was supposed to sell for us,

26:03.979 --> 26:07.482
then give us the proceeds,
less his ten percent.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.485
So you don't sell insurance?

26:10.568 --> 26:13.947
He's as much an insurance agent as I am.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.991
So who are you?

26:16.074 --> 26:18.618
Someone who doesn't like to be cheated.

26:18.702 --> 26:23.331
Or lied to. Or tricked into
disappearing innocent people

26:23.415 --> 26:26.918
then destroying their lives
and livelihoods

26:27.002 --> 26:29.337
based on spurious accusations.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.923
Like Barney's business partner.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.719
I don't recall Barney
having a business partner.

26:35.802 --> 26:39.431
He did. He's who Barney blamed
the theft of the necklace on.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.266
[Raymond] Then convinced me

26:41.349 --> 26:43.852
to disappear the poor soul as comeuppance.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.353
Which I did, happily.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.982
I had no reason to think
Barney would lie to me.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.817
He never had before.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.153
-[sobbing]
-[Raymond groans]

26:53.236 --> 26:59.576
I just can't believe
that my sweet Barney would lie to you

26:59.659 --> 27:01.119
about such a thing.

27:01.202 --> 27:04.205
Or to me about everything,
our entire lives.

27:04.289 --> 27:09.961
Not to mention manipulating you
into ruining the life of that Peter guy.

27:10.045 --> 27:13.673
There, there. I'm certain Barney
didn't lie about his love for you.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.674
Can we go?

27:15.425 --> 27:19.888
Matilda, seeing as how our dispute
was with Barney, not you,

27:19.971 --> 27:22.807
I'm prepared to leave you the necklace.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.478
I believe we've done
enough damage for one day.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.688
What? Are you sure?

27:30.273 --> 27:33.193
Oh, I'm sure. Wear it well.

27:34.110 --> 27:39.491
Remarry. Assume the worst,
hope for the best.

27:46.206 --> 27:49.959
[Aram] I have never seen anything
like the complexity of these robots.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.004
Real human hair, the feel of human skin.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.715
Insane expressive abilities.
Check this out.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.427
Wow.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.387
Right?

28:01.721 --> 28:04.724
Sir. Oh, uh--
Did everything go okay with your--

28:04.808 --> 28:06.851
The matter you were looking into?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.019
Everything went.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.855
Whether it went okay
or not remains to be seen.

28:10.939 --> 28:14.109
This is a glimpse into the future
I'm not sure I want to see.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.569
Tell me about it.
It's more communicative than I am.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.072
-Which isn't saying much, but still.
-Hang on.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.408
[beeps]

28:23.159 --> 28:24.702
Like looking in a mirror.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.914
Mirroring facial expressions is one.
Murder's another.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.499
Who's programming it?

28:29.582 --> 28:30.542
Not Genuine Models.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.461
This is Maverick Sawyer,
the CEO, the man who built the robots.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.048
-He's agreed to aid in our investigation.
-Least I can do.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.801
There has to be a reason,
that I'm missing,

28:39.884 --> 28:41.428
why the models are malfunctioning.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.846
[Aram] They're not malfunctioning.

28:42.929 --> 28:45.807
They're doing exactly
what they're being told to do.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.226
-She's been hacked.
-What?

28:48.893 --> 28:52.772
No, no, no.
That's not possible. Who's behind it?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.150
I don't know the who.
But I'm working on the where.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.777
Our robots run on a completely
secure operating system,

28:57.861 --> 29:00.739
and they learn from a user,
processed through the microphone.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.116
There's no way a hacker
could get into that system.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.410
Do you push updates
to the OS over the Internet?

29:06.035 --> 29:08.830
That's how they got in
and started overriding commands

29:08.913 --> 29:10.540
for these specific Chrissy robots.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.417
There must be an associated IP address.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.919
[Aram] Oh, yeah. Almost got it, hang on.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.337
Here we go, boom.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.800
It's an IP located at
2218 Ridgewood Drive in Bowie, Maryland.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.552
Good. Dembe, Ressler, roll out.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.137

30:21.027 --> 30:22.737
I won't let anything happen to you.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.162
Imagine my delight when you summoned me

30:31.246 --> 30:32.997
after so many years in Nunavut.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.669
One more bowl of caribou stew
and I'd be growing antlers.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.878
Yes.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.630
Yes, about that.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.966
I'd like to apologize, Peter.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.594
It seems I was sorely mistaken.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.180
Barney told me to cut you off at the knees

30:49.264 --> 30:52.350
and make sure you never made
another penny in the business.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.104
Imagine that, from Barney.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.899
But clearly, Barney wasn't being
entirely honest with me.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.361
And I did something I rarely do:

31:03.444 --> 31:04.946
I jumped to conclusions.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.324
But something's not sitting right.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.826
I simply cannot accept

31:09.909 --> 31:14.747
that my instincts about Barney
are as wrong as all that.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.791
What am I missing?

31:16.875 --> 31:20.920
Your instincts are spot-on,
Mr. Reddington.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.672
Barney was decent.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.300
Salt of the earth.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.637
His wife, on the other hand...

31:32.432 --> 31:34.893
Gordon Graham. Here he is.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.271
That's right. Graham is one
of our earliest customers.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.857
He's in the tech industry too,
if I'm correct.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.484
He was the CEO
of an electoral data startup

31:43.568 --> 31:47.030
that he sold for millions
and millions of dollars

31:47.113 --> 31:49.991
about a year ago February.
He disappeared from tech after that.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.744
That's two months after
he purchased his Chrissy model.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.287
Agents Ressler and Zuma

31:54.370 --> 31:57.123

was living with his Chrissy robot

31:57.206 --> 31:58.583
as if they were a real couple.

31:58.666 --> 32:01.920
Two toothbrushes, clothes for her,
jewelry, the whole nine. Bizarre.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.296
Maybe not so bizarre.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.632
We design our robots
to be anthropomorphic,

32:05.715 --> 32:07.926
with human-like capabilities,
empathetic skills

32:08.009 --> 32:10.803
which can induce feelings in customers.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.932
Gordon might believe that he and Chrissy
are in a real relationship.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.477
[Aram] And now, with these aesthetics
and AI advancements,

32:17.560 --> 32:21.105
people won't tell the difference
between what is real and what is not.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.691
Great. A whole world
of robosexuals awaits.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.527
Meantime, we've got a murderer on the run.

32:26.611 --> 32:30.281
-Is he on the move with Chrissy?
-It appears so.

32:30.365 --> 32:33.493
I installed geotracking units
in all of our models,

32:33.576 --> 32:36.371
as a safeguard for our customers
if their robots are stolen.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.499
Now, if Gordon hasn't removed it,
we may be in luck.

32:39.582 --> 32:43.252
I installed the geotracking units
in the models' ring fingers.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.270
But you, greedy little guts,

to pay to split the marital estate.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.487
It was much more lucrative,

you're terminated,
and poor Peter Finchy is the new boss.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.321
And this time,

37:20.404 --> 37:22.657
it is you who will be banished...

37:23.824 --> 37:27.578
left to fend for yourself
with no resources,

37:27.662 --> 37:31.082
no respite, and no retreat.

37:31.165 --> 37:36.087
And if I find out
you so much as stick a single toe

37:36.170 --> 37:37.838
back in the business,

37:37.922 --> 37:39.590
I will come to you...

37:40.549 --> 37:45.388
and I will take your tongue,
I'll take your hands,

37:45.471 --> 37:47.306
and I'll take your feet.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.812
But for now, I'll just be taking this.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.197
[door closes]

38:06.242 --> 38:09.370
Sawyer helped us locate
the two Chrissy models Graham hacked

38:09.453 --> 38:12.164
to kill Ambassador Warren
and Congressman Spate.

38:12.248 --> 38:15.293
[Park] Looks like he programmed the robots
to leave the crime scenes

38:15.376 --> 38:18.296
and return to him, so he could take them
out of circulation.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.132
[Aram] Sawyer's company
might be going away, but the tech isn't.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.758
It's now in the cultural bloodstream.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.512
Robots and the people
who want them for, well, everything,

38:26.595 --> 38:28.097
are with us forever.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.391
Any next of kin on Gordon Graham?

38:30.474 --> 38:32.518
We haven't been able
to track down any family.

38:32.601 --> 38:36.856
No friends. His only relationship,
it seems, was Chrissy the robot.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.108
I think he believed he loved her.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.651
I think he did love her.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.778
He's not the first person
to fall for somebody

38:42.862 --> 38:45.197
who's incapable of returning the favor.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.951
Not from personal experience.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.872
I just watch a lot of '80s teen,
coming-of-age movies.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.763
What's the latest on Everly Grant?

39:08.846 --> 39:11.182
She's secured with her family in Texas.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.060
I have a detail on them. But, Harold,

39:14.143 --> 39:16.687
you and I both know
the badge she described

39:16.771 --> 39:18.981
is a New York police detective's.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.900
This is getting out of control.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.152
Maybe we should call in reinforcements.

39:23.235 --> 39:27.531
We're not calling anybody, Lew.
After you left the bar with Grant,

39:27.615 --> 39:31.118
I had a run-in with Detective Heber,
who knows I got to her.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.412
We have no idea how deep this goes.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.122
I'm more of a prime suspect

39:35.206 --> 39:38.125
now that Heber knows
I'm talking with witnesses.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.420
We have to find this detective ourselves.

39:42.421 --> 39:45.466
Who did you piss off
in law enforcement, Coop?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.975
You've gone soft, Raymond.

39:55.768 --> 39:59.939
The old you would have meted out
the delicious punishment

40:00.022 --> 40:03.818
that hateful old crone deserved
on the spot.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.362
No regrets.

40:08.322 --> 40:09.782
You really have changed.

40:10.866 --> 40:11.826
You think?

40:13.702 --> 40:15.663
We're always good together.

40:15.746 --> 40:19.250
That's why I've missed you,
because we were good together.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.669
Especially when we were bad together.

40:25.005 --> 40:27.299
Maybe there's more fun to be had.

40:28.801 --> 40:29.677
You and me.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.519
As tempting as that sounds...

40:39.937 --> 40:42.773
you should know
that the man you once knew...

40:43.482 --> 40:46.402
died the day Elizabeth Keen was shot.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.697
And the man that remains is...

40:52.908 --> 40:57.496
less a person than a collection
of impulses and inclinations,

40:57.580 --> 40:59.707
most of them foul as tar.

41:00.833 --> 41:04.170
I only survived
thanks to the love and solace

41:04.253 --> 41:08.507
of a woman I met
under the most unlikely of circumstances.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.468
A woman who...

41:13.220 --> 41:16.015
carried me through
an unbelievable darkness.

41:17.808 --> 41:22.104
And you really think
that she'll have you, this woman?

41:22.188 --> 41:23.522
All of you?

41:25.608 --> 41:26.609
I--

41:27.902 --> 41:28.861
I hope so.

41:31.697 --> 41:35.451
But even if she won't,
at this moment, I'm hers.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.162
And that's all that matters.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.887
I think you should take this.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.013
[Cassandra] Ah.

41:57.014 --> 42:00.684
Why do I feel like this is a parting gift?
Hmm?

42:01.227 --> 42:03.437
Like I may never see you again.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.525
You never know.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.581
