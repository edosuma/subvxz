01:14.447 --> 01:17.117
It looks like she drug
in a real crowd, don't it?

01:17.152 --> 01:18.683
Sure does.

01:18.718 --> 01:21.019
Looks like it's gonna be
a full house tonight.

01:21.054 --> 01:24.091
Hey, what do you say we run in
and check out the show?

01:30.263 --> 01:33.166
How we doing here? We all
set? Hey, big crowd, huh?

01:33.201 --> 01:36.034
Yeah, and not one of them's
got a pot to piss in.

01:36.069 --> 01:38.236
I never should have let myself
get talked into this dumb benefit.

01:38.271 --> 01:42.014
I could be making some real money tonight.
All right, let's get this thing started.

01:48.748 --> 01:51.751
And now back home again

01:51.786 --> 01:54.220
the one, the only

01:54.255 --> 01:56.823
Ellen Aim!

02:17.877 --> 02:20.413
Lying in your bed
and on a Saturday night

02:20.448 --> 02:22.949
You're sweatin' buckets
and it's not even hot

02:22.984 --> 02:24.851
But your brain
has got the message

02:24.886 --> 02:26.251
And it's sending it out

02:26.286 --> 02:29.189
To every nerve
and every muscle you've got

02:29.224 --> 02:30.555
You've got so many dreams

02:30.590 --> 02:32.792
That you don't know
where to put 'em

02:32.827 --> 02:34.959
So you'd better turn
a few of 'em loose

02:34.994 --> 02:37.831
Your body's got a feeling
that it's starting to rust

02:37.866 --> 02:40.709
You'd better rev it up
and put it to use

02:41.301 --> 02:47.251
And I don't know how I ever thought
that I could make it all alone

02:47.874 --> 02:50.677
When you only make it better

02:50.712 --> 02:53.445
And it better be tonight

02:53.480 --> 02:55.880
I'll be there for you tonight

02:55.915 --> 02:58.416
Even if you don't have
anywhere to go

02:58.451 --> 03:01.020
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

03:01.055 --> 03:02.153
And your speed

03:02.188 --> 03:03.254
Is all you'll ever need

03:03.289 --> 03:05.758
All you'll ever need to know

03:05.793 --> 03:07.492
Darlin', Darlin'

03:07.527 --> 03:10.313
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

03:10.348 --> 03:13.064
And we've gotta get away
from the past

03:13.099 --> 03:15.969
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

03:16.004 --> 03:18.843
But we should
be goin' nowhere fast

03:18.878 --> 03:21.682
It's so much better
goin' nowhere fast

03:32.185 --> 03:35.121
Stalkin' in the shadows
by the light of the moon

03:35.156 --> 03:37.891
It's like a prison
and the night is a cell

03:37.926 --> 03:40.627
Goin' anywhere
has gotta be heaven tonight

03:40.662 --> 03:43.539
'Cause stayin' here
has gotta be hell

03:44.164 --> 03:46.933
Dyin' in the city
like a fire on the water

03:46.968 --> 03:49.667
Let's go runnin'
on the back of the wind

03:49.702 --> 03:52.238
There's gotta be some action
on the face of the earth

03:52.273 --> 03:55.412
And I've gotta
see your face once again

03:55.842 --> 04:01.849
And I don't know where I ever got
the bright idea that I was cool

04:02.448 --> 04:05.287
So alone and independent

04:05.322 --> 04:08.127
But I'm depending on you now

04:08.254 --> 04:13.465
And you'll always be the only
thing that I just can't be without

04:14.027 --> 04:16.473
And I'm out for you tonight

04:16.896 --> 04:18.997
I'm comin' out
for you tonight

04:19.031 --> 04:21.833
Even if you don't
have anywhere to go

04:21.868 --> 04:24.304
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

04:24.339 --> 04:25.436
And your speed

04:25.471 --> 04:26.638
Is all you'll ever need

04:26.673 --> 04:29.209
All you'll ever need to know

04:29.244 --> 04:30.742
Darlin', Darlin'

04:30.777 --> 04:33.484
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

04:33.680 --> 04:36.481
And we've gotta get away
from the past

04:36.516 --> 04:39.352
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

04:39.387 --> 04:42.272
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

04:42.307 --> 04:45.123
Everybody's goin'
nowhere slowly

04:45.158 --> 04:48.027
They're only fighting
for the chance to be last

04:48.062 --> 04:50.897
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

04:50.932 --> 04:53.400
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

05:02.475 --> 05:09.681
Godspeed

05:09.716 --> 05:13.026
Speed us away

05:14.120 --> 05:21.292
Godspeed

05:21.327 --> 05:23.761
Speed us away

05:23.796 --> 05:25.665
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:25.700 --> 05:27.065
Godspeed

05:27.100 --> 05:28.568
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:28.603 --> 05:29.801
Godspeed

05:29.836 --> 05:31.437
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:31.472 --> 05:32.870
Godspeed

05:32.905 --> 05:35.340
Speed us away

05:35.375 --> 05:37.210
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:37.245 --> 05:38.243
Godspeed

05:38.278 --> 05:40.079
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:40.114 --> 05:41.179
Godspeed

05:41.214 --> 05:42.915
We're goin' nowhere fast

05:42.950 --> 05:44.515
Godspeed

05:44.550 --> 05:47.189
Speed us away

06:21.921 --> 06:22.922
Now!

06:28.728 --> 06:32.266
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Get off the stage!

06:45.812 --> 06:47.880
Hey, you guys
shouldn't be doing this!

06:47.915 --> 06:49.916
Hey, we don't want
no trouble!

06:54.253 --> 06:57.256
Let me go!

06:57.291 --> 06:59.157
No!

06:59.192 --> 07:00.796
Let me go!

07:01.961 --> 07:03.701
Put me down now!

07:05.398 --> 07:08.276
Let me go! Let me go!

07:13.706 --> 07:15.776
Help me!

07:41.033 --> 07:42.944
Get them!

07:56.349 --> 07:59.557
Them Goddamn son-of-a-bitches!
Hang a one-eight.

08:02.221 --> 08:03.961
What's with that guy?

08:09.028 --> 08:10.094
Watch out!

08:10.129 --> 08:12.165
These guys are gonna pay!

08:18.905 --> 08:21.078
Someone help me!

08:22.909 --> 08:28.789
Stop it!

10:49.655 --> 10:51.600
Can I help you?
Coffee.

10:52.024 --> 10:54.265
Cream and sugar?
Just black.

11:33.766 --> 11:36.335
Oh, you guys really know
how to come through a door.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.902
What are you trying to prove?

11:37.937 --> 11:40.877
We just came down from Kings
Park looking for a good time.

11:40.912 --> 11:43.818
You guys already missed all the
excitement. The party's over.

11:44.176 --> 11:49.990
The Roadmasters are hungry. And
when they're hungry, they eat.

11:50.383 --> 11:52.952
The Bombers have brought this
act through The Richmond already.

11:52.987 --> 11:55.121
All you're doing in here
is looking like punks.

11:55.156 --> 11:56.656
Is that right?

11:57.390 --> 11:59.893
We're just gonna
have to mess the place up.

12:04.997 --> 12:09.343
And after we mess your place
up maybe we'll mess you up.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.609
Oh, you got a problem
with this, pretty boy?

12:33.225 --> 12:35.034
Try it again, punk.

13:11.731 --> 13:13.403
Go on, go home!

13:20.439 --> 13:22.851
What do you think
of my new car?

13:23.175 --> 13:26.588
It looks great. Why don't you
sell it and buy me a new window?

13:49.835 --> 13:51.836
Tom, come on, slow down.

13:51.871 --> 13:55.875
Reva, there's no point in stealing a
car, if you're not gonna ring it out.

14:07.386 --> 14:09.004
When are you
ever gonna grow up?

14:09.039 --> 14:10.882
Why should I?
This is more fun.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.690
Let me give you
some news, Tom.

14:12.725 --> 14:16.228
The Bombers and this guy Raven
Shaddock, they stole Ellen Aim.

14:16.263 --> 14:18.139
How the hell did that happen?

14:18.964 --> 14:20.272
Oh, shit!

14:20.566 --> 14:22.045
Goddamn cops!

14:43.823 --> 14:45.708
Okay, buddy, what the
hell do you think this is?

14:45.743 --> 14:47.593
We don't go for that kind
of speeding around here.

14:47.628 --> 14:48.793
Now let's see your license.

14:48.828 --> 14:51.365
Sorry, Officer,
I must have left it at home.

14:51.997 --> 14:55.968
Tom Cody. It's been a couple of years
since I've had any trouble out of you.

14:56.003 --> 14:58.035
Hey, Ed, I just came home
to visit my big sister.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.337
You're not gonna have any
trouble with me. Glad to hear it.

15:00.372 --> 15:03.342
We don't need somebody coming back
here trying to give us a hard time.

15:03.377 --> 15:06.429
Come on, Ed, he just got back.
Give him a break.

15:06.464 --> 15:09.482
Yeah, I'll give him a break.
Get out of here, Cody.

15:10.549 --> 15:13.686
Yeah, and anymore driving like
that and I'll give you a ticket.

15:13.721 --> 15:14.960
Asshole!

15:29.034 --> 15:31.235
Who the hell
does that guy think he is?

15:31.270 --> 15:36.208
Well, he's always been a real bad ass.
I busted him a couple of years ago.

15:36.243 --> 15:39.378
He had a pistol in the
glove compartment of his car.

15:39.413 --> 15:40.678
A real punk, huh?

15:40.713 --> 15:44.285
Yeah, he belongs in jail with all
the other juvenile delinquents.

16:05.304 --> 16:08.574
You sure I'm not gonna be cramping
your style with any guy tonight, huh?

16:08.609 --> 16:10.007
No, not tonight.

16:10.042 --> 16:12.311
I bring one in now and then
but there's nothing steady.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.811
I never seem to find
the right one.

16:13.846 --> 16:16.548
Yeah, I ain't having much luck
in that department myself.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.883
Look, Tom, you were always
real close with Ellen.

16:18.918 --> 16:21.287
She wasn't like all those tramps
you used to run around with.

16:21.322 --> 16:23.120
Reva,
it didn't work out, okay?

16:23.155 --> 16:25.490
Well, somebody figured out
how to make it work with her.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.791
She's been living with a guy
named Billy Fish. Who's that?

16:27.826 --> 16:31.563
He's done some rock joints in The
Battery. He started managing her act.

16:31.598 --> 16:34.433
Yeah, she was always
interested in going somewhere.

16:34.468 --> 16:35.604
Tom.

16:38.003 --> 16:39.136
She's not just your old girl.

16:39.171 --> 16:41.639
Reva, what do you want from
me, huh? You know what I want.

16:41.674 --> 16:44.710
You want me to go rescue an old girlfriend
who's shacked up with another guy?

16:44.745 --> 16:46.245
Thanks a lot.

17:13.372 --> 17:14.505
Tequila.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.973
Hey, Tom! Tom Cody.

17:17.009 --> 17:19.845
It's been a long time, pal.
How's your hammer hanging?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.244
How's it going, Clyde?

17:21.280 --> 17:24.580
Well, not so hot. I got beat
up trying to save your old girl.

17:24.616 --> 17:28.585
I could use a little help with those
guys. You should have been there, Tom.

17:28.620 --> 17:32.791
It would have been like the old days when
we were in school. We'd have kicked ass.

17:32.826 --> 17:35.227
Hey, bartender, you gonna
shoot the shit all night,

17:35.262 --> 17:37.194
or do you wanna
get me another drink?

17:37.229 --> 17:38.897
Hey, Tom, would you get a
load of this little heinie?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.364
She thinks she owns the place.

17:40.399 --> 17:42.902
I'm just trying to
get myself a drink, pal.

17:43.235 --> 17:45.772
Well, maybe you've already
had enough, babe.

17:45.904 --> 17:48.707
You gotta be kidding me!
Do I look like I'm kidding?

17:48.742 --> 17:50.874
You know, maybe you
ought to pay up as well.

17:50.909 --> 17:54.378
You've been driving up a tab here all
night and we're not real big on credit.

17:54.413 --> 17:57.826
Are you trying to say that I can't pay?
Yeah, let's see the color of your money.

17:59.651 --> 18:03.189
There. Happy? Yeah. But
now I don't like your face.

18:05.424 --> 18:08.336
You know, everywhere I go
there's always an asshole.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.910
Hey, you got any preferences?

18:18.771 --> 18:21.114
I've always been
a tequila man.

18:26.779 --> 18:28.383
Let's get out of here.

18:29.448 --> 18:32.082
The name's McCoy.
I'm a soldier.

18:32.117 --> 18:35.087
At least I was up until about
a year ago, ran out of wars.

18:35.122 --> 18:36.639
Yeah, what's your spec?

18:36.674 --> 18:38.122
Motor pool. Nothing fancy.

18:38.157 --> 18:40.692
But if it's got wheels I can
drive it and I can fix it.

18:40.727 --> 18:43.228
That's funny, I just got
out a couple of months ago.

18:43.263 --> 18:44.661
Been R and R ever since.

18:44.696 --> 18:46.641
Yeah?
How'd you like the army?

18:47.032 --> 18:50.411
I liked shooting the guns,
but I didn't win no medal.

18:52.271 --> 18:53.511
Hey!

18:55.541 --> 18:57.782
Is that your car?
Yeah.

18:58.377 --> 19:01.448
Nice. Yeah, I know. I just picked it up.

19:03.048 --> 19:06.885
Hey, Cody? That's your
name, right, Cody? Yeah.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.728
You got a spare bed?

19:10.122 --> 19:12.363
You want a quick tumble, huh?

19:13.859 --> 19:16.283
Hey, you may have a rough time
with this one,

19:16.318 --> 19:18.707
and I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but...

19:19.264 --> 19:21.038
You're not my type.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.837
Yeah, I guess it kind of figures. I
ain't had much luck with women lately.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.903
Yeah, well, you'll live.

19:25.938 --> 19:29.007
Something tells me that getting girls
isn't exactly your problem in life.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.911
Maybe some other time, huh? I
doubt it, but anything's possible.

19:32.946 --> 19:34.390
Hey, look...

19:35.681 --> 19:37.014
About the spare bed.

19:37.049 --> 19:40.240
I'm just passing through this
district. I don't know anybody.

19:40.275 --> 19:43.431
I'm between jobs and last
time I heard hotels cost money.

19:46.225 --> 19:47.567
Get in.

20:01.140 --> 20:05.544
My sister's got the bedroom, I got
the spare, that puts you on the couch.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.786
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
Yeah, no sweat.

20:18.524 --> 20:22.233
There you go, McCoy.
I'll see you in the morning.

20:24.630 --> 20:28.450
Hey, you always walk around packed,
huh? I told you, I'm a soldier.

20:28.485 --> 20:32.271
Yeah, well, don't go pointing that
thing at me, I wouldn't like it.

20:32.306 --> 20:34.907
I don't go pointing it,
unless I'm gonna use it.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.408
Yeah, right.

21:12.778 --> 21:17.583
No, you don't get by on pride

21:17.618 --> 21:21.462
It'll run over you

21:22.754 --> 21:24.856
But since you let me down

21:24.891 --> 21:26.924
I'm hard to be around

21:26.959 --> 21:29.561
I don't know
what I'm gonna do

21:29.596 --> 21:36.677
He could never be you

21:41.373 --> 21:44.319
Okay, you got it.
I'm gonna go and get her.

21:45.310 --> 21:47.277
But I ain't doing it
for nothing.

21:47.312 --> 21:51.049
You tell this Mr. Billy Fish to meet
me at the diner tomorrow at 12:00.

21:51.084 --> 21:53.461
Me and him are gonna talk
some business.

21:53.885 --> 21:56.955
Oh, there's a girl I picked up in
the Black-hawk sleeping on the couch.

21:56.990 --> 21:59.108
Give her some coffee
in the morning, okay?

21:59.143 --> 22:01.226
How come she's sleeping
in the front room?

22:01.261 --> 22:03.296
Why don't you go ask her?

22:25.017 --> 22:26.461
Hey, Pete!

22:29.021 --> 22:32.090
Hey, look, I really needed a place to
stay, so thanks for the use of the sofa.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.657
Oh, that's okay.

22:33.692 --> 22:36.660
You're the first girl Tom
ever brought home that used it.

22:36.695 --> 22:39.496
Yeah, well, sometimes it helps a
guy out if you don't make it so easy.

22:39.531 --> 22:43.911
He could use a little help in that direction.
Maybe he ought to meet a few more like you.

22:46.138 --> 22:49.608
A fellow came through here a
couple of months ago. Tapped out.

22:49.643 --> 22:52.409
Had to part with this outfit
after a card game.

22:52.444 --> 22:55.720
Real unhappy about it, too,
'cause it's all custom stuff.

22:55.947 --> 22:59.651
I tell you, if Tom wasn't going
for being number two to her music,

22:59.686 --> 23:02.119
so he just took off.
He was crazy about Ellen.

23:02.154 --> 23:04.222
He was just the kind of guy
who doesn't like to admit it.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.666
Yeah, sure, I know the type.

23:08.060 --> 23:09.092
I'll tell you something.

23:09.127 --> 23:12.898
Some people never talk about their
feelings, they got them deeper than anybody.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.674
Other people never talk about their
feelings 'cause they ain't got any.

23:19.905 --> 23:23.511
What's your story?
Me? Just looking for work.

23:50.535 --> 23:52.135
You must be Billy Fish?

23:52.170 --> 23:55.507
Yeah. So what gives, and make
it fast my time is valuable.

23:55.542 --> 23:58.010
You want Ellen Aim back,
I'm gonna get her.

23:58.510 --> 23:59.810
You and what army?

23:59.845 --> 24:02.587
I can see you two are gonna
get along just fine.

24:04.249 --> 24:07.619
I want 10 grand. Easy. All
you gotta do is earn it.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.287
I'll earn it
and you're gonna help.

24:10.322 --> 24:13.225
Reva told me you used to
live in The Battery.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.759
I started out there.
It's the shits.

24:15.794 --> 24:17.828
I wouldn't go back
to that dump if you paid me.

24:17.863 --> 24:21.199
You're going! I need somebody
who knows their way around.

24:21.234 --> 24:23.100
I don't think so.
It's not my scene.

24:23.135 --> 24:25.270
If you want your meal ticket
back, get in the car

24:25.305 --> 24:27.337
or otherwise the deal is off.

24:27.372 --> 24:30.208
Look, Cody, you sound pretty
dumb, but nobody's that dumb.

24:30.243 --> 24:31.341
I'm the one paying you.

24:31.376 --> 24:34.880
That means you go get her, I wait
here and you bring her back to me.

24:34.915 --> 24:36.680
You smart guys.

24:36.715 --> 24:40.218
You always figure you can hire a
bum like me to do your dirty work.

24:40.253 --> 24:42.061
Well, not this time!

24:42.687 --> 24:46.327
Can you really get her back?
You got a better volunteer?

24:56.735 --> 25:00.080
All right, I'll go.
She's real important to me.

25:13.084 --> 25:16.054
You know The Battery's
gonna be nothing but trouble.

25:16.089 --> 25:18.774
Yeah? Well, I'm getting
paid for it, right, Fish?

25:18.809 --> 25:21.460
That's right, Cody. You
cut me in, I'll back you up.

25:21.495 --> 25:22.526
I don't think so.

25:22.561 --> 25:24.996
Hey, what's your problem?
We're not taking no skirt along.

25:25.031 --> 25:27.365
Look, I don't think
you can handle it, okay?

25:27.400 --> 25:28.598
What do I gotta do?

25:28.633 --> 25:31.536
You know, people don't exactly have
written references for this kind of work.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.447
You should know that, Cody.

25:34.539 --> 25:37.776
I need the job. I'm plenty good
enough and I ain't gonna let you down.

25:37.811 --> 25:41.485
Listen, skirt, let me make it
simple for you. Take a hike.

25:43.715 --> 25:48.218
All right. I'll cut you in for 10%,
but get this, you're working for me.

25:48.253 --> 25:51.957
I tell you to do something, you do it.
You don't do more or you don't do less.

25:51.992 --> 25:54.893
And if you start dragging
your ass, I'm sending you home.

25:54.928 --> 25:55.926
Got it.

25:55.961 --> 25:57.227
Hey, what is this?
Get serious.

25:57.262 --> 26:00.565
I'm not paying you any extra to take
some sweetie pie along for company.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.975
You drive.

26:03.802 --> 26:07.806
Don't worry about it. They always
hire bums like me for jobs like this.

26:31.429 --> 26:33.698
Look, I'll take you through The
Battery where the Bombers hang out,

26:33.733 --> 26:35.065
but I'm not taking any risks.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.933
I'm not paying you to add
any thrills to my life.

26:36.968 --> 26:39.736
That's not how it works. You
got a real big mouth, Fish.

26:39.771 --> 26:43.108
Look, butch, I buy and sell more
people more valuable than you every day.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.876
You know, it's hard to figure
out what's more pathetic,

26:44.911 --> 26:47.279
the way you talk
or the way you dress.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.378
Let me tell you something.

26:48.413 --> 26:51.370
These clothes are worth more
than you make in a year.

26:51.405 --> 26:54.328
I can see working with you two
is gonna be a real dream.

27:13.305 --> 27:15.105
If they got her anywhere,
they got her at Torchies.

27:15.140 --> 27:19.144
It's a real knockdown joint, no
class. I used to book bands in there.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.778
It's right in the middle of
a big factory. It's the shits.

27:21.813 --> 27:25.817
You'll love it, McCoy. It's just your
style. Okay, Cody, what's the plan?

27:25.852 --> 27:28.118
How do you figure on handling all
these guys and their motorcycles?

27:28.153 --> 27:31.489
You start killing Bombers, we're gonna
be in worse shape than we're already in.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.056
I don't have to kill anybody.

27:33.091 --> 27:36.367
The motorcycles don't run so hot
when I'm shooting holes in them.

28:03.421 --> 28:07.324
Some neighborhood. Everything's
dead. What a place to come to.

28:07.359 --> 28:10.261
Just keep going straight ahead and
then make a left under the bridge.

28:10.296 --> 28:11.930
What are you?
Giving me orders now?

28:11.965 --> 28:13.029
Look, I know my way around.

28:13.064 --> 28:15.100
That's why you brought me
along, remember?

28:15.135 --> 28:16.600
I'll take care
of giving the orders.

28:16.635 --> 28:19.547
Get under the bridge,
pull over and kill the lights.

28:54.272 --> 29:01.684
Well one bad stud
moved in my neighborhood

29:02.847 --> 29:06.021
He's big and man
I know he ain't no good

29:07.152 --> 29:14.460
He don't wear no hat, and
Lord he don't wear no shoes

29:15.727 --> 29:18.833
He just hangs on the corner
singing old country blues

29:19.898 --> 29:21.934
Oh, well, one bad stud

29:22.200 --> 29:28.443
One bad stud

29:28.773 --> 29:31.142
I said, one, one, one, one,

29:31.177 --> 29:32.518
One bad stud

29:32.877 --> 29:40.828
If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

29:41.753 --> 29:45.632
'Cause the girls all love him
like a schoolboy loves his pie

29:46.157 --> 29:49.916
He loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock 'n' rye

29:49.951 --> 29:53.675
Yes, he loves his whiskey
he loves his rock 'n' rye

29:54.666 --> 29:58.875
You know it takes ten bottles
to make that fool get high

29:59.070 --> 30:01.439
Oh, well, one bad stud

30:01.474 --> 30:07.780
One bad stud

30:25.563 --> 30:28.198
You know, you're making
things real hard on yourself.

30:28.233 --> 30:33.071
You act nice, you and me fall in love
for a week or two and then I let you go.

30:33.106 --> 30:34.811
Nobody gets hurt.

30:35.807 --> 30:39.413
You see,
I ain't such a bad guy.

30:41.079 --> 30:44.424
I just get excited
around pretty girls.

30:54.459 --> 30:56.795
Oh, well, one bad stud

30:56.830 --> 31:02.878
One bad stud

31:03.401 --> 31:05.676
I said, one, one, one, one

31:29.394 --> 31:32.630
From now on either of you make any
mistakes, I'm making you walk home.

31:32.665 --> 31:34.666
Walk? I'm not gonna walk
around here, I'd get killed.

31:34.701 --> 31:37.271
You got it.
What about you, McCoy?

31:39.070 --> 31:41.573
Are we gonna do it or are
we gonna talk about it?

31:41.608 --> 31:43.143
You're right.

32:00.291 --> 32:03.067
The main drag
is around here somewhere.

32:05.463 --> 32:09.809
What the hell's that? Guess
you don't know who I am, do you?

32:12.337 --> 32:14.370
Things have gotten kind of
funny around here.

32:14.405 --> 32:17.593
All kinds of strangers coming
around, sneaking through the alleys.

32:17.628 --> 32:20.782
What the hell we talking to this
creep for? Let's get out of here.

32:22.180 --> 32:25.533
My gosh, you're scared. What's
even funnier, you're afraid of me.

32:25.568 --> 32:28.887
I'm just trying to get away from
you. We got some business here.

32:28.922 --> 32:33.130
Oh, you're dumb,
and you're short. Real short.

32:35.393 --> 32:39.529
You're after that girl, aren't
you? What makes you say that?

32:39.564 --> 32:42.066
Come down a back alley, 10:00 at
night carrying a bunch of guns,

32:42.101 --> 32:44.569
I don't figure you're here to give
The Battery a new coat of paint.

32:44.604 --> 32:47.523
Where they keeping her?
Torchies, second floor.

32:47.558 --> 32:50.442
Don't tell them I told
you, though. Pay him.

32:50.909 --> 32:54.143
Yeah, pay me.
I'm not gonna pay this jerk!

32:54.178 --> 32:56.915
Listen, shithead, you give
him some of your money,

32:56.950 --> 32:58.583
or I'll give him
some of your money.

32:58.618 --> 33:00.323
Don't call me "shithead. "

33:00.685 --> 33:02.352
Hey, you gotta
keep moving forward.

33:02.387 --> 33:05.256
That's the whole point of things,
and I thank you now, I appreciate it.

33:05.291 --> 33:07.395
Why don't you buy some soap?

33:08.593 --> 33:11.512
I don't need this guy
to tell me she's in Torchies.

33:11.547 --> 33:14.432
I said they had her
at Torchies. I am a shithead.

33:37.021 --> 33:38.721
Okay, Fish,
you get back to the car.

33:38.756 --> 33:42.627
I want you in that doorway over there
in 15 minutes and I mean 15 minutes.

33:42.662 --> 33:45.063
Are you crazy? They'll notice
me in a second down there.

33:45.098 --> 33:46.129
Don't worry about that.

33:46.164 --> 33:48.199
I'm gonna give them a couple
of other things to worry about.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.752
What about her? I thought she's
supposed to do the driving?

33:50.787 --> 33:53.271
Get moving! And you better
be ready when we get there.

33:59.344 --> 34:01.396
Do you trust him
or are you just desperate?

34:01.431 --> 34:03.413
You take the front entrance.
I'm going topside.

34:03.448 --> 34:06.918
If you can work your way upstairs to
help me out, fine, if not I'll handle it!

34:06.953 --> 34:10.695
Just what I always wanted to
do, Cody, take on the Bombers.

34:32.243 --> 34:34.016
Hey, baby!

34:57.602 --> 34:59.940
I've been around the world

34:59.975 --> 35:02.279
And every man bleeds the same

35:03.908 --> 35:06.348
But when the lights are dim

35:06.383 --> 35:08.788
You never know who's to blame

35:11.215 --> 35:14.172
I don't want no scars to show

35:14.207 --> 35:17.130
I don't want no one to know

35:17.388 --> 35:21.563
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

35:23.961 --> 35:27.081
No other place for me to go

35:27.116 --> 35:30.166
No other place for dying slow

35:30.201 --> 35:34.877
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

35:39.177 --> 35:40.810
I've been around the world

35:40.845 --> 35:44.019
I take credit
for the things I've done

35:45.416 --> 35:47.722
But when the lights are dim

35:47.757 --> 35:50.028
I'm not the only guilty one

35:53.024 --> 35:55.943
I don't want no scars to show

35:55.978 --> 35:58.828
I don't want no one to know

35:58.863 --> 36:03.004
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

36:03.434 --> 36:06.053
Hey! How you doing, babe?
Come around here much?

36:06.088 --> 36:08.631
Only when I wanna check out
some real action.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.593
Well, you're talking to
the right guy. Says who?

36:11.628 --> 36:14.520
Says me. I like a guy
that's got confidence.

36:14.946 --> 36:16.288
All right.

36:44.475 --> 36:46.342
No, that way's
the card game, huh?

36:46.377 --> 36:48.880
We're going down here.
We got a party room.

36:53.317 --> 36:57.321
Check it out, huh, baby? This is
the party room. How you like it, huh?

36:57.356 --> 37:01.257
I've had a lot of good times
here, so, let's party, huh?

37:01.292 --> 37:07.265
Hey, killer. Can I take my jacket off first?
Yeah, you can take off whatever you want.

37:07.300 --> 37:10.302
All right.
Now, listen to me, buddy.

37:10.501 --> 37:14.505
There's just one thing I want you
to do, and that is to keep quiet.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.038
Hey, come on, babe,
what is this thing loaded?

37:16.073 --> 37:18.142
We're gonna play a little game.
You Bombers are gonna like it.

37:18.177 --> 37:19.828
It's called "lights out. "

37:19.863 --> 37:22.289
No other place for me to go

37:22.324 --> 37:24.680
No other place for dying slow

37:24.715 --> 37:30.062
So I'll be killing
just killing time

37:31.022 --> 37:35.061
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

37:39.730 --> 37:41.330
I've been around the world

37:41.365 --> 37:44.311
I take credit
for the things I've done

37:46.003 --> 37:48.206
But when the lights are dim

37:48.241 --> 37:50.410
I'm not the only guilty one

37:52.043 --> 37:53.743
Knock, knock.

37:53.778 --> 37:56.681
I don't want no scars to show

37:56.716 --> 37:59.549
I don't want no one to know

37:59.584 --> 38:03.793
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

38:31.182 --> 38:33.282
Go ahead and take that money,
sweetie.

38:33.317 --> 38:35.987
You better pray you make
it out of The Battery.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.558
I don't think
she's after the money.

39:15.259 --> 39:17.326
You know poker's
a real interesting game

39:17.361 --> 39:20.398
especially when you've got
all the best cards!

39:21.866 --> 39:24.175
Next time it'll be right in your
nuts, pal. You know what I mean?

39:42.820 --> 39:44.856
Guys, it's been a slice.

39:48.092 --> 39:50.080
Who are you?
McCoy. I'm a big fan.

39:50.115 --> 39:52.069
Yeah, great,
come on, let's go.

39:55.399 --> 39:57.071
Who is that guy?

40:01.072 --> 40:03.674
Look out, it's surrounded! Get
this guy out of The Battery.

40:03.709 --> 40:05.483
Move it! Move it!

40:15.186 --> 40:17.063
This way. Follow me!

40:29.533 --> 40:32.503
Jesus, Ellen, am I glad to see you.
I thought you were gone forever.

40:32.538 --> 40:34.605
Cody, get in! This ain't no
time for checking out the sights!

40:34.640 --> 40:36.090
Take off! I'm gonna run
these guys for awhile.

40:36.125 --> 40:37.817
I'm staying with you...
You're not going with him!

40:37.852 --> 40:39.448
You stay in the car!
Stay with your boyfriend!

40:39.483 --> 40:41.010
McCoy, meet me at
the Grant Street underpass.

40:41.045 --> 40:44.424
Right. If we don't see
you, Cody, have a nice life!

41:42.173 --> 41:43.908
McCoy, can't you drive
this car any faster?

41:43.943 --> 41:45.627
I don't want any Bombers
sneaking up on us!

41:45.662 --> 41:47.276
Let's get our asses
out of here real quick!

41:47.311 --> 41:49.345
And where's this Grant Street
anyway? I never heard of it before!

41:49.380 --> 41:52.486
You sure you know where you're going?
Turn it off, Fish! You sound pathetic!

42:00.124 --> 42:01.261
Well.

42:03.360 --> 42:07.364
Looks like I finally ran into someone
that likes to play as rough as I do.

42:07.399 --> 42:12.643
Yeah, this must be your lucky
night. I'm lucky? I guess maybe I am.

42:13.370 --> 42:17.808
And you're dumb. Real dumb, if
you think you can pull this off.

42:17.843 --> 42:21.844
I think you're forgetting
something. I got the gun.

42:21.879 --> 42:27.021
I can get guns, smart guy. Lots of them.
Now why don't you tell me your name.

42:27.718 --> 42:30.391
Tom Cody. Pleased to meet you.

42:32.656 --> 42:37.002
I'll be coming for her, and
I'll be coming for you too.

42:37.461 --> 42:40.032
Sure, you will,
and I'll be waiting.

43:30.548 --> 43:33.217
Listen, I say we give it a couple of
minutes then get out of here, okay?

43:33.252 --> 43:34.416
What are you talking about?

43:34.451 --> 43:37.955
I'm talking about saving our ass.
We got a lot to live for, Ellen.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.155
He came and he got me! I'm
not going back without him.

43:40.190 --> 43:43.227
Don't worry about him. He's getting
paid a lot of money to look after Raven.

43:43.262 --> 43:45.530
What money? What do you think
he's doing this for love?

43:45.565 --> 43:47.798
You think he's doing this
'cause he's your biggest fan?

43:47.833 --> 43:50.134
He's getting paid, dear.
He takes his chances!

43:50.169 --> 43:52.614
Hey! Too bad, Billy.

43:53.137 --> 43:56.015
Looks like Ellen's old flame
decided to show up.

44:14.024 --> 44:16.003
Okay, we're on the move.

44:17.428 --> 44:19.228
What's this old flame stuff?

44:19.263 --> 44:21.096
Didn't you know?
Ellen used to go with Cody,

44:21.131 --> 44:24.435
real hot and heavy from what
I hear. You know what I mean?

44:24.470 --> 44:25.901
What, is she kidding?

44:25.936 --> 44:29.576
Let's not get into it now, okay,
Billy? Hard news, huh, shorty?

44:50.461 --> 44:53.797
Look, Cody, we've had our differences,
but it looks like we got it made now, huh?

44:53.832 --> 44:55.599
We'll just zoom along here
for a couple of hours,

44:55.634 --> 44:56.765
then we're home and dry.

44:56.800 --> 45:00.475
I got news for you, it ain't that
simple. We gotta bury the car.

45:00.804 --> 45:02.973
Bury the car? What are you
talking about "bury the car"?

45:03.008 --> 45:05.107
He means we're gonna
get rid of it, stupid.

45:05.142 --> 45:07.478
He's gonna get rid of the car?
What's wrong with the car?

45:07.513 --> 45:08.946
This is what I'm paying you
all this money for?

45:08.981 --> 45:10.779
To come up
with these brilliant ideas?

45:10.814 --> 45:14.227
Why don't we just hand ourselves back
over to Raven and ask him to shoot us?

45:44.081 --> 45:46.772
You two go ahead. I wanna talk
alone with Tom for a minute.

45:46.807 --> 45:49.463
What are you talking about?
What are you going with him for?

45:51.155 --> 45:52.998
Hey, I don't like
the way this looks, Ellen.

45:53.257 --> 45:55.964
I'm paying the bills around
here. How about some respect?

46:00.197 --> 46:03.300
So what do you wanna talk to me
about? I got a lot to say to you, Tom.

46:03.335 --> 46:05.334
No, you don't.
You have nothing to say to me.

46:05.369 --> 46:07.654
You wanna talk to somebody,
go talk to your boyfriend.

46:07.689 --> 46:09.905
Look, what was I supposed
to do? I had all that work.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.443
Things were going real good. Things
were starting to happen for me.

46:12.478 --> 46:14.476
Yeah, so, bye-bye,
Tom, right?

46:14.511 --> 46:15.879
You're the one who took off
and joined the army.

46:15.914 --> 46:17.579
Let's forget all this.
It's history.

46:17.614 --> 46:21.452
From now on I'm just like you. I do
what I'm good at and I do it for money.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.818
Is that why
you came and got me?

46:22.853 --> 46:26.021
That's right. Billy Fish
is paying me 10 grand.

46:26.056 --> 46:30.834
I just can't believe you'd do that.
Maybe you'd better get used to the idea.

46:32.296 --> 46:33.797
I wonder what
they're talking about?

46:33.832 --> 46:36.198
Who says they're talking?
Cute.

46:36.233 --> 46:39.339
It was just a joke, man,
you know what I mean?

46:40.070 --> 46:42.371
How big a thing
do you think they had anyway?

46:42.406 --> 46:46.149
From what I hear it was real major.
Yeah, well, she's with me now.

46:46.577 --> 46:49.113
Yeah, right. Against a big
tough, good-looking guy like you,

46:49.148 --> 46:51.149
Cody don't stand a chance.

47:00.157 --> 47:02.391
I hope you two got
everything straightened out.

47:02.426 --> 47:06.829
Yeah, we got a lot straightened
out. It was a real eye opener.

47:06.864 --> 47:11.001
I think I hurt your girlfriend's
feelings. I'm real sorry about it.

47:11.036 --> 47:13.955
What does he mean he hurt
your feelings? What'd he say?

47:13.990 --> 47:16.874
Did he say anything about me?
What'd he say? Tell me!

47:37.327 --> 47:40.467
I'm tired

47:41.698 --> 47:43.643
I'm thirsty

47:46.069 --> 47:48.845
I'm wild eyed

47:50.107 --> 47:52.382
In my misery

47:55.045 --> 47:57.582
Timeless

47:58.615 --> 48:01.459
In your finery

48:03.487 --> 48:05.523
A high price

48:07.558 --> 48:09.867
For your luxury

48:13.430 --> 48:15.671
Sorcerer

48:16.767 --> 48:19.270
Who is the master

48:21.572 --> 48:25.747
Man and woman
on a star stream

48:25.909 --> 48:29.686
In the middle of a snow dream

48:30.681 --> 48:32.751
Sorcerer

48:34.017 --> 48:37.396
Show me the high life

48:39.356 --> 48:41.597
Come over

48:43.060 --> 48:46.405
Let me put you on ice

48:53.403 --> 48:55.041
I'm tired

48:57.207 --> 49:00.586
When I need you badly

49:02.112 --> 49:04.023
Wild eyed

49:05.883 --> 49:09.159
In the middle of your dream

49:10.821 --> 49:12.425
Timeless

49:15.525 --> 49:18.929
Hey. Hi, you guys. Hey, what's
the hurry? Where you guys going?

49:18.964 --> 49:21.730
We're nobody, we're going
nowhere. Nobody goes nowhere.

49:21.765 --> 49:25.576
Look, knock it off, we're not
interested in conversation, okay, moron?

49:27.371 --> 49:31.341
I know you. I know who you are, dig?
I love your stuff so much, I really do.

49:31.376 --> 49:32.507
Look, if you love me so much,

49:32.542 --> 49:34.278
why don't you just go away
and leave us alone.

49:34.313 --> 49:36.144
No, look,
I'm your biggest fan, really.

49:36.179 --> 49:37.946
Let me go with you, okay?
I won't be any trouble.

49:37.981 --> 49:40.048
And I'll tell you guys something,
you gotta get off the street,

49:40.083 --> 49:44.121
'cause the cops know the guys that hit
The Battery will be coming through here.

49:44.156 --> 49:45.420
Shit!

49:45.455 --> 49:47.256
We gotta get
a new set of wheels.

49:47.291 --> 49:51.068
Great, we just got rid of the old
wheels. Wonderful leadership, Cody.

50:01.872 --> 50:05.042
Hey, what's the matter with you? Are
you looking to get yourself run over?

50:05.077 --> 50:08.612
Me and my friends need a lift.
So what? This ain't no muni bus!

50:08.647 --> 50:10.279
Need a lift real bad.

50:10.314 --> 50:16.520
Now look, let me make it real clear.
Nobody tells me where to take my bus.

50:16.555 --> 50:17.964
You dig?

50:19.389 --> 50:20.956
Well, we're very flexible.

50:20.991 --> 50:23.060
We'll take you where you wanna
go. Anywhere you wanna go.

50:23.095 --> 50:24.693
You just say the word
and we're with you.

50:24.728 --> 50:27.898
You folks just hop right in.
Just make yourself at home.

50:27.933 --> 50:29.468
I'm driving.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.742
Hey, Bird, what the hell
you doing, man?

50:50.587 --> 50:52.154
Hey, how you guys doing?

50:52.189 --> 50:54.858
My name's McCoy. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you none.

50:54.893 --> 50:57.859
That's great.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

50:57.894 --> 51:01.318
We're the Sorels. I'm Bird.
These are my associates.

51:01.353 --> 51:04.743
This is Lester. My man
B.J., and that's Reggie.

51:08.238 --> 51:10.940
Aren't you Ellen Aim?
That's right. It is Ellen Aim.

51:10.975 --> 51:13.643
Hey, Ellen, you guys need
an opener or anything?

51:13.678 --> 51:14.743
I mean, we're good.

51:14.778 --> 51:17.114
I mean, we're real good, but we just
can't seem to get anything going.

51:17.149 --> 51:19.883
Hey, look, what gives? I handle
the management and the booking.

51:19.918 --> 51:23.018
Now, you guys just shut up
and leave Ellen alone.

51:23.053 --> 51:25.389
Look, I know how tough it
can be getting the right gig.

51:25.424 --> 51:26.855
Baby, you don't
even begin to know.

51:26.890 --> 51:29.870
Man, what did I tell you guys?
Will you just cool it?

51:35.899 --> 51:40.575
Hey, if you got any chance at all of
missing the cops, it's through here.

51:41.338 --> 51:45.843
Yeah, so what are our
chances? Horrible and terrible.

51:46.309 --> 51:47.709
Oh, that's just great.

51:47.744 --> 51:50.580
Look, we don't wanna mess
with any of these Ardmore cops.

51:50.615 --> 51:52.014
They busted me
a couple of years ago,

51:52.049 --> 51:54.584
threw my ass right in jail
'cause I wouldn't pay them off.

51:54.619 --> 51:56.251
What'd they bust you for?

51:56.286 --> 51:59.489
Disturbing the peace. They said I
got out of line in some bar, you know?

51:59.524 --> 52:01.969
Great.
I love a girl with class.

52:34.891 --> 52:39.229
This is great, just great. You
wanna help change this tire, shorty?

52:39.264 --> 52:41.949
Changing flat tires isn't
exactly my line of work, dear.

52:41.984 --> 52:44.634
If that's the case, then
why don't you just shut up?

52:44.669 --> 52:46.773
Why don't you just shut up?

52:51.541 --> 52:53.675
Then I try and write songs,
you know.

52:53.710 --> 52:56.678
I just can't seem to figure out how
to do it right the way you do it.

52:56.713 --> 52:59.282
You know, I can't figure out how you
work out the rhymes and the melodies

52:59.317 --> 53:00.849
and you make it all come out.

53:00.884 --> 53:03.954
Somebody else writes the songs,
Billy buys them or steals them,

53:03.989 --> 53:05.187
I can't write for shit.

53:05.222 --> 53:08.391
I always thought those were
your songs. I just sing them.

53:08.426 --> 53:11.094
Yeah, but when you sing them,
you make it yours.

53:11.129 --> 53:12.896
That's the way it is, right?

53:12.931 --> 53:15.035
I guess so. Who knows?

53:15.665 --> 53:19.237
The famous Sorels sure put a
lot of money into that bus, huh?

53:19.736 --> 53:22.239
Listen, Cody, I didn't know you had
a thing with Ellen in the old days.

53:22.274 --> 53:23.638
You better get some smarts.

53:23.673 --> 53:26.041
Learn to adjust to the fact that
you're out of the picture now.

53:26.076 --> 53:29.880
You see, Cody, I do things for her.
Things that a guy like you could never do.

53:29.915 --> 53:32.155
Things that matter
in the real world.

53:37.354 --> 53:38.653
You know something?

53:38.688 --> 53:43.193
The only trouble with kicking the shit
out of you is it would be too easy.

53:49.533 --> 53:51.945
You keep your hands
off the suit, buddy.

53:55.705 --> 53:59.659
Come on, hurry the hell up with that
flat tire, already, let's get going.

53:59.694 --> 54:03.613
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

54:03.813 --> 54:10.554
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

54:10.589 --> 54:12.122
Countdown to love

54:12.157 --> 54:13.188
Ten

54:13.223 --> 54:16.126
Remember when you didn't
love me

54:16.161 --> 54:17.259
Nine

54:17.294 --> 54:20.536
Now all the time
you're thinking of me

54:20.664 --> 54:24.839
Eight, life is great
You're all I'm living for

54:25.001 --> 54:28.573
This is my countdown to love

54:28.772 --> 54:32.685
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

54:33.910 --> 54:37.687
You are the one love
in my life

54:37.847 --> 54:40.987
I know you feel that way too

54:42.352 --> 54:46.163
Oh, what a thrill
when I'm holdin' you near

54:46.289 --> 54:50.396
All of my wild dreams
come true

54:50.527 --> 54:51.593
Four

54:51.628 --> 54:54.764
Forevermore you'll be my lover

54:54.799 --> 54:55.997
Three

54:56.032 --> 54:58.969
It's you for me
there'll never be another

54:59.004 --> 55:00.001
Two

55:00.036 --> 55:03.574
Together forever
we'll be as one

55:05.041 --> 55:06.645
Pretty good, you guys.

55:07.444 --> 55:09.177
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

55:09.212 --> 55:12.647
Cody? All right, Ellen,
Baby Doll, down in back.

55:12.682 --> 55:16.286
Fish, McCoy, we're working for the
Sorels. Fish, you're the manager.

55:16.321 --> 55:17.419
I'm way ahead of you, Cody.

55:17.454 --> 55:19.856
What, do you think I gotta be a
genius to know what you're going for?

55:19.891 --> 55:22.268
I'll handle this.
I'll talk us through.

55:37.374 --> 55:41.311
Hey, guys, how's it going? I'm
the bus driver here for the Sorels.

55:41.346 --> 55:44.547
We're on our way to play a gig
at an after hours joint.

55:44.582 --> 55:46.615
The Sorels. The singers.
You know them, right?

55:46.650 --> 55:50.320
No. Never heard of them. You know
what's going on here, don't you?

55:50.355 --> 55:52.721
Look, man, all I know
is we're running real late.

55:52.756 --> 55:56.159
Well, babe, some outfit just broke into
The Battery and burned half of it down.

55:56.194 --> 55:57.359
Really?

55:57.394 --> 55:59.327
Knock off the crap, will you?

55:59.362 --> 56:01.564
As far as I'm concerned anybody
that goes into The Battery

56:01.599 --> 56:03.465
and does some damage
deserves a medal.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.419
Well, let me tell you how we look
at it. Look, cut the shit, okay?

56:06.454 --> 56:09.304
You guys got a big job to do, we're
trying to get where we're going.

56:09.339 --> 56:13.576
Now, let us through, or you wanna come
to some kind of financial arrangement?

56:13.611 --> 56:15.210
Well, what do you
think, Harry?

56:15.245 --> 56:19.115
Well, I think what we got here
is a model citizen.

56:19.150 --> 56:21.686
I knew you guys
talked my language.

56:25.655 --> 56:27.225
Keep it coming.

56:28.458 --> 56:31.159
You guys take a big bite.
That's right.

56:31.194 --> 56:33.895
Nice to see there's some
integrity left on the force.

56:33.930 --> 56:37.867
You know, you're just a little
too anxious to buy us off.

56:37.902 --> 56:40.279
Spade musicians
with a big wad of money.

56:41.504 --> 56:43.608
All right,
everybody off the bus!

56:47.177 --> 56:49.711
All right, now this is
how we're gonna play it.

56:49.746 --> 56:53.421
You're gonna walk off this bus
like there's nothing wrong. Get me?

57:00.990 --> 57:04.266
All right, down on
the ground! Do it! Now!

57:05.495 --> 57:06.803
Get over there!

57:08.365 --> 57:11.901
Don't worry about it, fellows.
We'll be out of your face in no time.

57:11.936 --> 57:15.092
You know, some of you guys
got some cute little asses.

57:15.127 --> 57:18.249
Be a real shame if I had
to blow them off! Stay down!

57:18.408 --> 57:19.477
Oh, shit!

57:23.179 --> 57:24.312
All right!

57:24.347 --> 57:25.655
Son-of-a-bitch!

57:32.155 --> 57:34.692
Come on, man, let's get
out of here! Come on!

57:52.175 --> 57:53.346
Go! Go!

57:55.945 --> 57:57.479
Shut the hell up!

57:57.514 --> 58:00.790
McCoy, pull out in a back
alley, we're gonna dump the bus.

58:01.184 --> 58:03.493
First he dumps the car,
now he's dumping the bus?

58:08.358 --> 58:12.306
Code 99! Code 99.
Blockade at Cross and Ardmore.

58:12.662 --> 58:14.662
Suspects armed and dangerous!

58:14.697 --> 58:17.499
Repeat, armed and dangerous!
Broke blockade!

58:17.534 --> 58:21.573
Heading north on Ardmore.
Cannot pursue. Do you copy?

58:22.472 --> 58:25.782
God damn it, this is the blockade
at Ardmore, come back to me.

58:36.419 --> 58:37.761
Come on.

58:59.576 --> 59:01.077
Come on! Come on!

59:11.154 --> 59:12.654
We had a $1,000 in that bus!

59:12.689 --> 59:16.459
I lost my clothes, the luggage is
gone, all the sheet music is gone!

59:16.494 --> 59:17.559
This is great.

59:17.594 --> 59:20.196
We're on our way to the
Richmond. No bus, no nothing.

59:20.231 --> 59:22.005
You shouldn't have stopped,
Bird.

59:40.049 --> 59:42.688
He ain't a real
social kind of guy, is he?

59:43.286 --> 59:45.857
Really? Gee, I think
he's a real sweetheart.

59:45.989 --> 59:48.825
Cut him some slack, will you?
He was there for you tonight.

59:48.860 --> 59:50.358
Yeah, he really
earned his money.

59:50.393 --> 59:52.629
You know, you got a real
funny way of saying thanks

59:52.664 --> 59:54.028
when someone saves your ass.

59:54.063 --> 59:56.232
Why don't you go sit with
your pal Billy over there.

59:56.267 --> 59:58.868
I guess he's more
your kind of guy.

59:58.903 --> 01:00:01.041
Yeah, I think maybe I will.

01:00:15.418 --> 01:00:19.388
Don't worry, babe, everything's
gonna be okay from now on.

01:00:21.925 --> 01:00:23.836
We're gonna be great.

01:00:55.358 --> 01:00:58.261
Hey, Reva, Ellen Aim's back.
And guess what? Tom's with her.

01:00:58.296 --> 01:01:00.900
Is he okay? Oh, he
looked all right to me.

01:01:01.898 --> 01:01:03.138
Chief?

01:01:21.584 --> 01:01:23.063
Tom.

01:01:24.354 --> 01:01:27.892
Reva, cut it out. We made it.
Everybody's in one piece.

01:01:28.558 --> 01:01:31.629
What about that, Ellen?
You okay?

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.164
Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.

01:01:36.199 --> 01:01:38.633
No, she's not. She's tired,
and she's been roughed up.

01:01:38.668 --> 01:01:41.502
I'm gonna take her back to the
hotel so she can get some rest.

01:01:41.537 --> 01:01:44.641
This whole thing started 'cause I
had to do a gig in this shit hole.

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:47.849
I should've stayed the
hell away from this dump!

01:01:48.511 --> 01:01:50.511
Is that the way
you feel about it, Ellen?

01:01:50.546 --> 01:01:53.116
Yeah, I guess I just wanna
get away from here.

01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:54.983
Get back on the road.

01:01:55.018 --> 01:01:58.658
Now you're talking, kiddo.
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:02.626
I hate you for taking money
to come and get me.

01:02:05.094 --> 01:02:07.198
That's telling him, Ellen.

01:02:26.249 --> 01:02:29.752
I guess she doesn't like you much,
Cody. She doesn't seem real thankful.

01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:32.388
Yeah, one thing about you,
Cooley, you catch on real quick.

01:02:32.423 --> 01:02:34.791
Yeah, that's right, Buddy,
and I get the job done.

01:02:34.826 --> 01:02:37.771
Good. Because I think
it's just starting.

01:03:09.258 --> 01:03:12.796
What the hell does he
wanna talk about? Tom Cody.

01:03:16.165 --> 01:03:17.871
I want Tom Cody.

01:03:18.868 --> 01:03:21.804
I wanna nail that son-of-a-bitch's
head to the sidewalk

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:25.239
under that marquee
that says Ellen Aim on it?

01:03:25.274 --> 01:03:28.845
And just to prove to you,
I'm gonna be a nice guy,

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.757
I'm coming in
with just two of my men.

01:03:32.048 --> 01:03:36.052
After I take care of Cody,
there'll be no more trouble.

01:03:38.788 --> 01:03:42.599
You do your job, man.
Keep the peace.

01:04:10.052 --> 01:04:12.538
Hey, Cody, I need a drink.
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:04:12.573 --> 01:04:15.024
Maybe I can get lucky and pick
a fight with that bartender.

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:16.764
No, not this time.

01:04:25.635 --> 01:04:29.139
Hey, McCoy, look, I'll get
you your money later, okay?

01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:32.141
Is that all you got to say is,
"I'll get your money to you later. "

01:04:32.176 --> 01:04:35.144
Yeah, that's all I gotta say.
What else do you wanna hear?

01:04:35.179 --> 01:04:36.778
Hey, look,
I did real good back there.

01:04:36.813 --> 01:04:40.624
So what? I'm all out of medals,
besides you're getting paid.

01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:48.391
You know, Reva, Ellen Aim
was right about one thing,

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:50.131
your brother's a jerk.

01:05:09.178 --> 01:05:12.181
What's your problem? You're
feeling pretty sorry for yourself...

01:05:12.216 --> 01:05:13.481
Don't start on me, Reva.

01:05:13.516 --> 01:05:15.251
She comes back to town,
tells you and everybody else

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.317
it doesn't mean a goddamn...

01:05:16.352 --> 01:05:19.655
Yeah and the worst part is she
runs off with that creep Billy Fish.

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.858
You know, Tom, I didn't ask
you to go out and get Ellen Aim

01:05:21.893 --> 01:05:23.658
because she looks great
on stage.

01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:27.363
Well, what the hell do you
care... I care about you!

01:05:27.398 --> 01:05:28.596
And this town!

01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:31.868
Look, if you're gonna fight, you're
supposed to fight for something.

01:05:31.903 --> 01:05:34.203
You and Billy Fish are the
same. You're both selfish!

01:05:34.238 --> 01:05:36.706
All you two
are really worried about...

01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:40.476
Hi, Ed. I came to talk to your brother.

01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:42.182
Come on outside.

01:05:52.822 --> 01:05:56.565
Raven says he has to face you
alone. Right here in The Richmond.

01:05:57.627 --> 01:06:02.565
I'm ordering you to get out of town,
Tom. I want you on a train tonight.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.198
If Raven comes in here
to face you,

01:06:04.233 --> 01:06:06.802
I'll be waiting for him
right here with a lot of guns.

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.270
I'm throwing his ass in jail.

01:06:09.305 --> 01:06:12.308
I am not gonna sit around
and watch two maniacs

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:15.276
play out some little game
about personal honor.

01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:18.080
I want you gone. If you're
still in town tomorrow morning,

01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:21.390
I'm throwing your ass in jail
right next to Raven.

01:06:28.157 --> 01:06:31.125
Look, you did real good
rescuing her, Tom.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.664
You surprised me. 'Cause I
didn't think you had it in you.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:38.434
Now, surprise me again.
Do something else real good,

01:06:38.469 --> 01:06:40.504
be on that train tonight.

01:07:13.636 --> 01:07:16.275
Yeah, come in.
Hey, I'll get It.

01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:18.081
Who is It?

01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:25.486
What the hell are you still doing here? Oh,
hey, look, see you guys later, all right?

01:07:32.922 --> 01:07:36.562
I've been expecting you I
know what you want. Ten grand.

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:40.194
I'm as good as my word.
I pay on time.

01:07:40.229 --> 01:07:42.098
You know you play rough,
Cody, but you do a good job.

01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:43.164
You should do
a little more work for me

01:07:43.199 --> 01:07:44.899
when you get a taste of
what that money'll bring you.

01:07:44.934 --> 01:07:47.403
Then you'll realize I'm the
one with the brains around here

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.314
and you'll start
treating me a bit nicer.

01:07:51.507 --> 01:07:53.843
You know, nobody ever had
a hold on me the way you did.

01:07:53.878 --> 01:07:55.609
I would have done
anything for you.

01:07:55.644 --> 01:07:58.180
A long time ago I would have
thought you were worth it.

01:07:58.215 --> 01:08:00.023
Not anymore, babe.

01:08:02.184 --> 01:08:03.819
Where do you get off
talking to her like that?

01:08:03.854 --> 01:08:05.886
She's way out of your league,
musclehead.

01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:09.925
This is the grand I promised
McCoy. You can keep the rest.

01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:19.139
You know what's wrong
with that guy? He's stupid.

01:08:21.504 --> 01:08:22.670
I'm sorry, Billy.

01:08:22.705 --> 01:08:25.344
What are you sorry about? Where
are you going? Where you going?

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.246
Tom!

01:08:29.045 --> 01:08:32.457
Tom, wait!

01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:35.416
What was I supposed to do?

01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:38.554
I hadn't heard from you in two years.
You didn't even write me a letter.

01:08:38.589 --> 01:08:40.930
What did I do
that was so wrong?

01:08:57.273 --> 01:08:59.140
You gotta go away.

01:08:59.175 --> 01:09:01.542
You fought enough fights,
you can let this one go.

01:09:01.577 --> 01:09:05.247
With both of us gone, maybe...
What do you mean "both of us"?

01:09:05.282 --> 01:09:08.591
Us! I wanna go with you.

01:09:09.652 --> 01:09:11.461
We could be together.

01:09:13.421 --> 01:09:17.335
You'd really come along with
me? In two seconds I would.

01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:21.035
Please?

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.310
Well, if it isn't
my old pal, Tom Cody.

01:09:51.345 --> 01:09:54.495
How's it going?
Great till you got here.

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:56.749
I've just been talking
things over with Clyde.

01:09:56.784 --> 01:09:58.968
You remember he and I
used to be real close.

01:09:59.003 --> 01:10:00.970
Hey, Tom, tequila, right?

01:10:08.577 --> 01:10:10.181
Here's what I owe you.

01:10:12.915 --> 01:10:17.261
You did real good back there. I
couldn't have got her out without you.

01:10:18.554 --> 01:10:21.288
Maybe I rode you a little
harder than I should have.

01:10:21.323 --> 01:10:25.669
Don't get sentimental on me. I
wouldn't know how to handle it.

01:10:38.741 --> 01:10:41.410
Hey, I got a problem with
Ellen I gotta talk to you about.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.711
Yeah, I understand
about these kind of things.

01:10:43.746 --> 01:10:47.950
You know, Cody, I was actually in
love once myself. It didn't work out.

01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:49.383
You're the kind
that makes bad picks, huh?

01:10:49.418 --> 01:10:52.755
He was the worst. He lied to
me all the time, cheated on me.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.546
Well, if I ever run into
him, I'll give him your best.

01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:58.303
Of course, you know,
that's before I was a soldier.

01:11:03.432 --> 01:11:08.103
You're real crazy about Ellen, aren't
you? Yeah, I don't know. I guess I am.

01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:10.873
Hey, there's nothing wrong with
it. Nothing to be embarrassed about.

01:11:10.908 --> 01:11:13.107
I ain't embarrassed. I just
know it ain't gonna work out.

01:11:13.142 --> 01:11:16.510
Ellen and I are going in different
directions. It's nobody's fault.

01:11:16.545 --> 01:11:20.414
Maybe you're right, 'cause you don't
look like no back-up singer to me.

01:11:20.449 --> 01:11:23.896
Look, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
I gotta do something I don't wanna do.

01:12:09.999 --> 01:12:12.035
Come on.
Tom.

01:12:13.736 --> 01:12:15.069
This is not The Bayside.

01:12:15.104 --> 01:12:17.273
This is something back in The
Richmond I gotta take care of.

01:12:17.308 --> 01:12:18.906
What are you...

01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:20.874
You get as far
from here as you can.

01:12:20.909 --> 01:12:23.445
You run until you hit The Bayside
and you can hang out there.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.151
Sure, tough guy.

01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:47.870
When's this train take off? I
gotta get back to The Richmond.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:48.936
We don't.

01:12:48.971 --> 01:12:51.657
Look, lady, I gotta get
moving. It's important.

01:12:51.692 --> 01:12:54.343
Well, you ain't gonna
get there on this train.

01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:56.645
Hey! Maybe you better think about it.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.746
The Bombers have gone crazy.

01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:02.524
They're doing everything they
can to seal off The Richmond.

01:13:27.409 --> 01:13:28.888
Let's go.

01:13:44.026 --> 01:13:46.160
What the hell
are you doing here, Clyde?

01:13:46.195 --> 01:13:49.098
I told everybody to get off the
streets until this thing is over with.

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:51.800
Yeah, but I wanna see
Raven run from up close.

01:13:51.835 --> 01:13:53.506
Just stay out of the way.

01:14:00.743 --> 01:14:02.109
Well?

01:14:02.144 --> 01:14:07.150
Real simple. There's no showdown. Tom
Cody ain't here and neither is the girl.

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:09.854
I don't get it.

01:14:11.453 --> 01:14:13.432
Get off your bike, Raven.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:18.901
I ain't too crazy
about jails, Chief.

01:14:20.896 --> 01:14:23.103
I got a better idea for you.

01:14:41.316 --> 01:14:43.420
Holy shit!

01:14:48.924 --> 01:14:51.267
They're here! They're here!

01:15:10.012 --> 01:15:13.459
I told your friend Cody
I could get a lot of guns.

01:15:14.116 --> 01:15:16.459
Hey, get out of my way!
What the hell!

01:15:17.786 --> 01:15:19.853
What is this?
You can't get away with this.

01:15:19.888 --> 01:15:22.691
You think you can ride into any
town and kidnap anybody you want?

01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:25.933
Now, get the hell out of town
and leave these people alone.

01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:56.593
Sorry I'm late. I got
something special in mind.

01:15:57.326 --> 01:16:00.068
I brought them along
just for you.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.904
Well, my plan went to shit.
Let's see how you do.

01:16:13.108 --> 01:16:14.643
Kick his ass.

01:16:42.504 --> 01:16:43.846
Nice, huh?

01:16:55.117 --> 01:16:56.459
Get him!

01:17:30.452 --> 01:17:31.931
Drop him!

01:18:22.037 --> 01:18:23.140
Tom!

01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:56.507
Let's get out of here!

01:20:20.455 --> 01:20:25.404
No more timing

01:20:25.527 --> 01:20:29.065
Each tear that falls
from my eyes

01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:33.440
I'm not hiding

01:20:33.802 --> 01:20:37.706
The remedy to cure
this old heart of mine

01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:40.618
I can dream about you

01:20:41.476 --> 01:20:44.718
If I can't hold you tonight

01:20:45.947 --> 01:20:47.881
I can dream about you

01:20:47.916 --> 01:20:51.086
You know something, Waldo,
we're gonna be rich.

01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:53.463
Yeah. Long live rock and roll.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:58.032
I can dream about you

01:20:58.493 --> 01:21:01.963
If I can't hold you tonight

01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:06.171
I can dream about you

01:21:06.935 --> 01:21:10.211
You know how
to hold me just right

01:21:12.274 --> 01:21:16.347
Moving sidewalks,

01:21:16.511 --> 01:21:20.186
I don't see under my feet

01:21:21.383 --> 01:21:25.020
Great, huh? My new discovery. I'm
gonna take them right up the ladder.

01:21:25.055 --> 01:21:27.864
Yeah, they ought to make you
a lot of money, Fish.

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:32.561
Look, don't worry, Cody, I'm not
gonna stand in your way with Ellen.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:35.064
I know how it is
between you two.

01:21:35.997 --> 01:21:37.798
There's one thing
we both know, Fish.

01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:40.168
She needs you a lot more
than she needs me.

01:21:40.203 --> 01:21:43.370
Yeah, she needs me,
but she loves you.

01:21:43.405 --> 01:21:46.775
She'll get over it. She's
used to me being unreliable.

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:49.309
Is that what I'm
supposed to tell her?

01:21:49.344 --> 01:21:53.519
You're okay with words. You'll
make her feel better than I could.

01:21:56.351 --> 01:21:58.262
Take it easy, Cody.

01:21:58.954 --> 01:22:00.330
Thanks.

01:22:00.622 --> 01:22:02.795
I'll take it
wherever I can get it.

01:22:07.529 --> 01:22:12.774
Climbing up
from the pain in my heart

01:22:13.068 --> 01:22:15.275
'Cause it's you that I need.

01:22:23.945 --> 01:22:29.500
I can dream

01:22:29.535 --> 01:22:35.056
Everybody!

01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:43.075
Yes, I can dream

01:22:50.038 --> 01:22:52.105
I don't understand it

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:56.111
I can't keep my mind
off loving you

01:22:56.146 --> 01:22:58.090
Love you forever

01:22:58.546 --> 01:23:00.513
Ooh, now baby

01:23:00.548 --> 01:23:04.686
I'm caught up
in the magic I see in you

01:23:04.721 --> 01:23:06.655
There's one thing to do

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.555
I can dream about you

01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:12.549
Guess you're just gonna cut
out, huh? Yeah. You know me.

01:23:12.584 --> 01:23:16.508
Yeah, I know you. You're
the guy with the right hook.

01:23:21.836 --> 01:23:24.748
Is that it? Is that
all you've left to say?

01:23:26.675 --> 01:23:30.210
Look, I know you're gonna be going
places with your singing and stuff,

01:23:30.245 --> 01:23:34.852
but then I'm not the kind of guy to be
carrying your guitars around for you.

01:23:36.418 --> 01:23:40.422
But if you ever need me
for something, I'll be there.

01:23:44.592 --> 01:23:48.471
I can dream about you

01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:53.101
I'm gonna press my lips against
you and hold you tight to me

01:23:53.136 --> 01:23:56.104
I can dream about you

01:23:57.138 --> 01:24:01.676
You know you got me spellbound
what else can it be

01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:04.019
I can dream

01:24:05.347 --> 01:24:08.225
Dreamin' about you

01:24:44.185 --> 01:24:47.658
I've got a dream
'bout an angel on the beach

01:24:47.693 --> 01:24:51.132
And the perfect waves
are starting to come

01:24:52.861 --> 01:24:56.482
His hair is flying out
in ribbons of gold

01:24:56.517 --> 01:25:00.104
And his touch
has got the power to stun

01:25:01.169 --> 01:25:04.939
I've got a dream
'bout an angel in the forest

01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:08.181
Enchanted by
the edge of a lake

01:25:10.178 --> 01:25:13.632
His body's flowing
in the jewels alive

01:25:13.667 --> 01:25:17.087
And the earth below him
starting to shake

01:25:17.819 --> 01:25:21.425
But I don't see
any angels in the city

01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:25.600
I don't hear
any holy choirs sing

01:25:26.461 --> 01:25:28.863
And if I can't get an angel

01:25:28.898 --> 01:25:30.830
I can still get a boy

01:25:30.865 --> 01:25:34.023
And a boy'd
be the next best thing

01:25:34.058 --> 01:25:37.182
The next best thing
to an angel

01:25:37.372 --> 01:25:40.876
A boy'd be the next best thing

01:25:48.383 --> 01:25:51.206
I've got a dream
'bout a boy in a castle

01:25:51.241 --> 01:25:54.030
And he's dancing
like a cat on the stairs

01:25:54.856 --> 01:25:57.962
He's got the fire
of a prince in his eyes

01:25:57.997 --> 01:26:01.069
And the thunder
of a drum in his ears

01:26:01.663 --> 01:26:04.449
I've got a dream
'bout a boy on a star

01:26:04.484 --> 01:26:07.236
Lookin' down
upon the rim of the world

01:26:08.303 --> 01:26:11.172
He's there all alone and
dreamin' of someone like me

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:14.278
I'm not an angel
but at least I'm a girl

01:26:15.143 --> 01:26:17.979
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

01:26:18.014 --> 01:26:20.925
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

01:26:21.349 --> 01:26:24.719
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

01:26:24.754 --> 01:26:26.438
You'll never know
what it means

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:28.382
But you'll know how it feels

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:31.256
It's gonna be over, over

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:33.994
Before you know it's begun

01:26:34.029 --> 01:26:36.698
It's all we really got tonight

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:38.266
Stop your cryin' hold on

01:26:38.301 --> 01:26:39.506
Tonight

01:26:39.767 --> 01:26:41.736
Before you know it it's gone

01:26:41.771 --> 01:26:42.976
Tonight

01:26:43.238 --> 01:26:49.544
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.778
Let the fire be started

01:26:51.813 --> 01:26:55.183
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

01:26:55.218 --> 01:26:56.919
Let the rebels begin

01:26:56.954 --> 01:26:58.585
Let the fire be started

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.923
We're dancing for the
desperate and the broken-hearted

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:03.556
Let the rebels begin

01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:06.662
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:27:07.529 --> 01:27:09.796
Before you know it it's gone

01:27:09.831 --> 01:27:13.744
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

01:27:15.803 --> 01:27:17.170
No matter what it seems

01:27:17.205 --> 01:27:23.955
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:27:24.746 --> 01:27:27.021
Before you know it's begun

01:27:27.715 --> 01:27:30.695
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:27:31.286 --> 01:27:33.663
Before you know it's begun

01:28:00.148 --> 01:28:02.717
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

01:28:02.752 --> 01:28:05.754
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

01:28:06.054 --> 01:28:09.090
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:10.959
You'll never know
what it means

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.781
But you'll know how it feels

01:28:12.816 --> 01:28:14.568
It's gonna be over, over

01:28:14.963 --> 01:28:18.116
Before you know it's begun

01:28:18.151 --> 01:28:21.269
It's all we really got tonight

01:28:21.304 --> 01:28:22.904
Stop your cryin' hold on

01:28:22.939 --> 01:28:24.270
Tonight

01:28:24.305 --> 01:28:26.274
Before you know it it's gone

01:28:26.309 --> 01:28:27.514
Tonight

01:28:27.942 --> 01:28:33.581
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:34.983
Let the rebels begin

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:36.316
Let the fire be started

01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:40.288
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

01:28:40.323 --> 01:28:41.606
Let the rebels begin

01:28:41.641 --> 01:28:42.855
Let the fire be started

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.793
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:28:45.828 --> 01:28:47.827
Before you know it it's gone

01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:51.741
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

01:28:53.067 --> 01:28:55.101
No matter what it seems

01:28:55.136 --> 01:28:58.378
Tonight is what
it means to be young

01:29:04.345 --> 01:29:06.480
Hey, Cody, how do you
like my new wheels?

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:08.581
I found it
in the middle of the street.

01:29:08.616 --> 01:29:11.986
Somebody just dumped it. Finders
keepers, you know what I mean?

01:29:12.021 --> 01:29:14.577
Maybe you need
some company, huh?

01:29:14.612 --> 01:29:17.133
Yeah, I don't mind
if you tag along.

01:29:21.262 --> 01:29:23.435
I guess this is
my big chance, huh?

01:29:26.267 --> 01:29:29.942
Hey, cool down, big guy, I already
told you, you're not my type.
