30:56.439 --> 30:58.054
How's that feel?

30:58.816 --> 31:01.023
(SIGHS) The nausea is better.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.986
But I can't...
It's okay.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.984
Your visual field
will clear in
a couple of hours.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.406
I'm going to give you
some more sedatives

31:09.493 --> 31:11.029
so you can get some rest.
No, please. I don't...

31:11.120 --> 31:12.610
I don't need any.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.708
It's okay. She's out.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.255
We need to talk.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.393
You've been quiet
for a long time.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.223
Not acting like a man
who's about to get
a big payday.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.524
Liber8 pays its debts.

31:43.611 --> 31:46.227
Could do a lot of good
for you people.

(SNIFFS)

31:54.997 --> 31:57.659
Or have I read this wrong?

32:01.629 --> 32:03.210
Maybe you've made other plans.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.215
What are you doing?

32:09.178 --> 32:11.169
I fear I'm being betrayed.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.138
Tell me if you think
I'm being paranoid.

32:15.226 --> 32:16.966
There's something
going on.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.853
You won't make it
two kilometers.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.021
I could. With your help.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.950
I will take you
as far as the ridge,
but no further.

32:32.034 --> 32:33.990
Come on.
I can ask no more.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.315
Jaworski.

33:16.745 --> 33:17.905
Where is he?

33:18.539 --> 33:21.451
Jaden took him.
There's a trade coming.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.908
And not only for him.
You're in danger, too.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.586
I feel like we've
made a terrible mistake.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.043
Maybe I can help.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.048
PANGEA: Wait, please.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.005
How much of a head start
did they get?

33:38.100 --> 33:39.180
Not much.

33:39.268 --> 33:41.259
An hour, maybe.
An hour and a half.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.278
how far along are you?

33:55.201 --> 33:57.783
l have a son.
I barfed for nine weeks.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.330
The gleaner lifestyle
was fine for me, but...

34:03.417 --> 34:04.953
I don't know.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.035
It's okay. We'll...

34:07.129 --> 34:08.960
We'll talk as we walk.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.181
The crossbow's gone.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.809
So are the keys
to the handcuffs.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.607
Your whatever-it-is
isn't working.
You can't call for help.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.810
We have no idea
where Jaworski went.

34:35.658 --> 34:37.819
You're supposed to be
the resourceful one.
Where do you...

34:39.203 --> 34:40.192
(SOFTLY) No.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.534
How far are we
from the Mamquam?

34:45.334 --> 34:46.915

34:47.002 --> 34:48.208
"Follow the bank
to Squamish."

34:48.295 --> 34:49.831
That's what he said.
Could you show me?

34:53.133 --> 34:56.125
I'm sorry, Pangea.
You can't help him now.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.720
All right. Okay.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.017
Okay.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.266
There we go.
Need a break?

35:08.357 --> 35:09.642
No.
Okay.

Oh, you are a better
tracker than I gave you
credit for, Protector.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.287
This is the end of
the line, Jaworski.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.334
How do you figure?

35:31.422 --> 35:33.037
It's just you and me.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.542
I like my odds.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.550
You want to watch her die,
try something.

35:40.389 --> 35:41.549
I wouldn't.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.219
You'll just get her killed.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.066
Your move, Protector.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.734
This is my move.

35:59.033 --> 36:00.022

36:09.043 --> 36:10.078
Mr. Sadler.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.413

I'm not interrupting.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.755
Please, sit.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.459
I wanted to apologize
for the terrible way
you heard,

36:19.553 --> 36:22.215
and to express
my condolences.

36:23.766 --> 36:24.755
Thank you.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.768
I'm loyal to SadTech, sir,
but this is a terribly
odd thing to process.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.358
My fortunes have radically
improved, but my life is...

36:33.442 --> 36:34.773
The bonus credits?

36:36.111 --> 36:39.729
Yes, they're
imperfect instruments,
but it's all we have.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.689
It's not that.

36:43.369 --> 36:44.654
I value myjob.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.990
But I love my wife.

36:51.293 --> 36:52.578
You have a son.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.748
I told him his mother's
on assignment until
things are definitive.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.795
I raised my son
as a single father.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.374
It's not easy,
but there are rewards.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.255
Mr. Sadler, l, um...

37:02.930 --> 37:04.136
(SIGHS)

37:05.599 --> 37:06.884
Never mind.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.886
No. No, speak your mind.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.354
So few people do
with me nowadays.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.390
It's a life.

37:16.318 --> 37:19.355
It's not a write-down
or a settlement.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.232
It's a life.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.950
We are the wealth
that we create.

37:24.743 --> 37:30.033
In life, that means
good works, productivity,
offspring, goodwill.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.540
But ultimately,
each of us is judged
by what we leave behind.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.962
Some of that
is measurable,

37:36.505 --> 37:38.461
but our valuations
don't capture everything.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.627
We let actuaries
and balance sheets
determine our worth.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.342
Even that word "worth,"
it's...

37:44.430 --> 37:45.670
It's not the right word.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.340
Well, well...

37:49.435 --> 37:51.676
Shocked as hell to
get a ping off
your CMR, Cameron.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.306
Thought they'd taken
a write-down on you.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.437
Yeah, it's completely frazzed.
Yeah, we'll get
you sorted.

37:55.524 --> 37:56.980
I've also got
a civilian passenger.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.307
All right.
We'll get her sorted, too.

37:58.402 --> 38:01.189
We gotta clear
the area, now.
This is a hot zone.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.107
ALEC: If Kiera has paid
the ultimate price

38:07.202 --> 38:08.612
for her loyalty
to the corporation,

38:09.913 --> 38:11.369
it will not go unnoticed.

38:11.457 --> 38:14.369
I suppose I'm looking
for meaning in it all.

38:14.668 --> 38:17.831
Something to tell our son
to help him understand.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.458
ALEC: The meaning
is all around you.

38:20.924 --> 38:25.088
SadTech and
the other members of
the Corporate Congress,

38:25.179 --> 38:27.135
their sole purpose,

38:27.222 --> 38:30.806
to enrich the lives
of all the citizens.

38:30.893 --> 38:33.726
To preserve the promise
of a civil society.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.975
To never again slip
into the chaos ofthe past.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.602
You tell your son
his mother’s life,

38:41.570 --> 38:44.607
has enabled all of us
left behind to prosper.

38:44.698 --> 38:45.983
Do you
really believe that?

38:46.074 --> 38:48.326
The answer to that question is

38:48.410 --> 38:49.946
the burden of an old man,

38:51.163 --> 38:53.745
one cursed to see
10 steps ahead.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.242
Oh, no.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.995
(STAMMERING) I have to go.

39:01.632 --> 39:02.621
What?

39:03.300 --> 39:06.838
What the corporation
cannot own, it destroys.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.925
The gleaners brought
this on themselves.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.677
Greed poisons.
lt punishes everyone.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.387
Oh, my God.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.971
Oh, my God!

39:19.983 --> 39:22.190
Oh, my God!
Take what you're feeling

39:22.277 --> 39:24.268
and put it towards
something right.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.073
This is your place
and your time.

39:27.616 --> 39:30.483
Follow your instincts
to take a moral stand.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.993
I'm not
a revolutionary, Edouard.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.161
No.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.536
You're a healer.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.414
And that's something
far more useful.

39:42.464 --> 39:46.207
You're going to
go back and take
the super soldierjob.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.667
A great day is
coming, Sonya.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.504
And you will be
on the inside.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.463
That is what
you can do.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.681
That is your way.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.976
You do not
serve or bargain.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.142
You will heal.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.474
You will heal us all.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.606
For them.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.954
STEFAN: For a while,
you were thinking
for yourself, Protector.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.533
Guess it's back
to sleep now.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.627
Enjoy your cage.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.168
Even in a cage,

40:28.010 --> 40:30.217
I'm freer than
you'll ever be.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.755
KIERA: He was right.

40:34.850 --> 40:37.091
KATHERINE: Who was?
Jaworski?

40:38.854 --> 40:40.014
Kagame.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.317
He said
I would see things
through new eyes.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.517
Make choices of my own.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.402
Kagame wiped out
that whole compound.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.229
Why?
I don't know.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.446
But I do know
he had his reasons.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.788
Each of us

41:00.876 --> 41:02.707
is judged by what
we leave behind.

41:04.171 --> 41:05.160
Who said that?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.041
Alec Sadler.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.545
Or he will say it.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.049
Why this particular
memory, Kiera?

41:15.807 --> 41:18.298
Jaworski said
I was asleep.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.133
Curtis Chen said
the same thing.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.719
I wouldn't put stock
in what Curtis says.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.893
There's good
in your future.
You're proof of that.

41:25.984 --> 41:30.523
There was something
in Curtis' eyes,
and I recognize it now.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.479
Jaworski had it.
Kagame had it.

41:32.574 --> 41:33.939
Zealotry.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.990
Commitment.

41:36.078 --> 41:38.069
Are you saying
you aren't committed?

41:39.956 --> 41:41.412
I'm saying

41:43.335 --> 41:44.996
I'm not asleep anymore.

41:54.846 --> 41:55.881
Thank you.

42:00.435 --> 42:01.971
I'm going home.
