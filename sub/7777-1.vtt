<i>There's two kinds of people in this world
when you boil it all down.</i>

00:21.154 --> 00:24.555
<i>You've got your talkers
and you've got your doers.</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:28.491
<i>Most people are just talkers.
All they got is talk.</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:34.023
<i>But when all is said and done,
it's the doers who change this world.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:39.661
<i>And when they do that, they change us.
And that's why we never forget them.</i>

00:40.440 --> 00:41.964
<i>So, which one are you?</i>

00:42.075 --> 00:43.667
<i>Do you just talk about it</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.371
<i>or do you stand up
and do something about it?</i>

00:46.513 --> 00:52.349
<i>Because believe you me,
all the rest of it is just coffeehouse bullshit.</i>

01:39.166 --> 01:43.466
<i>Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory.</i>

01:44.471 --> 01:46.939
<i>So it had been for my boys.</i>

01:50.443 --> 01:54.243
<i>For some time now,
the past had felt like a dream to them,</i>

01:55.415 --> 01:57.042
<i>faded and worn.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:02.718
<i>And then suddenly,
as if not a day had passed,</i>

02:06.860 --> 02:08.452
<i>it was back.</i>

02:09.529 --> 02:11.793
<i>I could see it in their eyes.</i>

02:12.766 --> 02:15.826
<i>I could feel it, heavy in their presence.</i>

02:19.539 --> 02:21.973
<i>Something calling them back.</i>

02:40.527 --> 02:42.358
Something's happened.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.714
No! Stop! Stop, stop!

03:09.489 --> 03:13.016
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please! Please!

03:13.593 --> 03:15.686
God, no, stop.. .

03:25.839 --> 03:27.136
A priest?

03:29.943 --> 03:32.036
Did they release his name?

03:32.846 --> 03:37.249
No, but I made a few calls.
I still have friends in the diocese there.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.812
McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.850
-You knew him?
-Knew of him. Everybody did.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.358
He's a good man.
Youth hostels, soup kitchens.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.195
He even made it to the papers sometimes.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.066
Look, boys,
I think it's best if you just stay put

03:58.204 --> 04:01.935
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.011
Aren't you at least gonna try
and talk them out of this?

04:08.114 --> 04:11.606
For all we know, it could be somebody
just trying to get away with murder here.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.843
Aye.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.248
Only there's a thousand easier ways
to do that.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.454
Trust me.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.751
Someone's trying to call them out.

04:23.396 --> 04:29.028
You kill a priest, in a church,
and make it look like it was them.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.731
Bring them back with a vengeance.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.632
Someone thinks it's really clever.

04:36.776 --> 04:41.076
-Only one problem with this little plan.
-What's that?

04:41.181 --> 04:42.546
It worked.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.514
Exactly what do you intend to do?

05:59.426 --> 06:03.556
Every last motherfucker
that had anything to do with it.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.306
<i>There is no new information
on the victim found slain</i>

06:20.413 --> 06:23.143
<i>this morning inside
the Church of the Holy Saints.</i>

06:23.249 --> 06:27.015
As you can see, the size of the crowd here
has increased substantially

06:27.120 --> 06:31.580
as we have confirmed that the body
was ritualized with pennies in the eyes.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.158
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card

06:34.260 --> 06:37.423
of the prolific vigilante killers
known as the Saints,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.930
<i>who went on a murder spree here in Boston.</i>

06:40.066 --> 06:44.503
<i>A rampage that ended eight years ago when
the Saints brazenly walked into open court</i>

06:44.604 --> 06:47.334
<i>and executed Mafia don
Poppa Joe Yakavetta</i>

06:47.440 --> 06:49.340
<i>before a courtroom of terrified witnesses</i>

06:49.876 --> 06:52.242
and then simply disappeared without a trace.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.246
<i>As police have yet to confirm
the Saints' possible involvement,</i>

06:56.382 --> 06:59.078
<i>the ominous question
hangs heavy in the air.</i>

06:59.219 --> 07:00.243
<i>"Are they back?"</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:08.083
We need to keep our heads here.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.923
It's probably not even them.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.464
Course it ain't them.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.068
All our skeletons just came screaming
out of the closet.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.104
-We're fucked!
-We're not fucked!

07:19.239 --> 07:23.107
We are totally fucked! And not just fucked.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.303
Like elephant-dick-pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,

07:26.446 --> 07:29.074
-jungle-fucked!
-Now's not the time to panic, green beans!

07:29.282 --> 07:33.446
I disagree! Now is a perfect time to panic.
We are all accessories.. .

07:33.586 --> 07:35.247
-Don't fucking say it!
-I'm gonna say it, all right.

07:35.355 --> 07:38.153
-You've got a mouth on you, Greenly.
-Both of you calm down. Just calm down.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.952
Shut the fuck up!

07:41.361 --> 07:43.761
Her ETA's 10 minutes.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.922
Thanks, Seamus.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.434
It's game time. How we playing this?

07:57.177 --> 08:00.010
Feds love to pull
the divide-and-conquer routine.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.479
We hardline her. Stick together on this.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.846
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.082
We're a brick wall.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.423
Let's rock this bitch.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.387
Eunice Bloom. It's a pleasure.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.291
Now, you have got to be Greenly.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.295
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.957
Well, funny as in "ha-ha," though,

08:54.067 --> 08:56.729
not like funny as in "gay,"
'cause I'm totally not.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.532
What we're trying to figure out is,
with all due respect, Agent Bloom.. .

09:00.673 --> 09:03.733
-"Special."
-Excuse me?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.868
You see, there's a "special"
before my "agent."

09:06.980 --> 09:10.040
If we're gonna address each other formally,
I'd appreciate if you popped it in there,

09:10.149 --> 09:11.810
because it makes me feel special.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.681
Of course, I was hoping
we could be a bit more personable.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.687
ln fact, I'd welcome you to call me Eunice,
and maybe I.. .

09:16.789 --> 09:18.552
Okay, Eunice.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.724
I don't see why the fuck the Fed
is even involved.

09:23.529 --> 09:27.056
"Fuck"? This isn't a "fuck" situation, is it?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.930
I mean, I can understand a "goddamn"
or two, but why skip all the way.. .

09:30.069 --> 09:33.664
What is the Fed's interest in this?

09:35.241 --> 09:39.905
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing the men responsible

09:40.046 --> 09:43.277
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's finest criminals.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.715
They could have sent anyone. They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?

09:46.819 --> 09:50.687
Well, since we've already broken
the "fuck" barrier, allow me to be blunt.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.054
It is because I am so fucking smart

09:53.159 --> 09:56.617
that I make smart people feel
that they are retarded.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.752
-Motherfuckers! Which one do you want?
-Me first, man, me first!

10:24.691 --> 10:25.783
Bust his head!

10:25.992 --> 10:27.755
That son of a bitch over there!

10:33.166 --> 10:36.135
All right! House is closed, motherfuckers!

10:39.138 --> 10:41.129
Why are his hands chained?

10:41.507 --> 10:43.441
Romeo is very fast, man.

10:43.609 --> 10:46.578
He says the Frenchman can't lay
a hand on him.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.637
But he can't hit him back.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.940
<i>That's the bet, ese.</i>

10:51.184 --> 10:53.778
He's got to last five minutes.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.092
-Fifty on the Mexican.
-Fifty on the Mexican.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.424
Never fight a Mexican, Pierre.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.800
Pound for pound,
toughest motherfuckers on Earth!

11:16.042 --> 11:17.202
Attaboy!

11:17.343 --> 11:20.005
You know why? We like pain, Pierre.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.273
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

11:22.382 --> 11:25.215
Think about it, man. Tabasco sauce?

11:25.351 --> 11:29.117
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?

11:31.090 --> 11:33.320
Get the fuck out of the way!

11:40.733 --> 11:41.722
Whore.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.395
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, I can't hit you.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.301
I ain't gonna hit you!

11:49.442 --> 11:52.673
Found a loophole, bitch!
I ought to be a lawyer.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.760
Thank you!

12:12.899 --> 12:14.230
Shit, man!

12:34.921 --> 12:37.219
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please!

12:40.793 --> 12:44.058
Please! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!

12:54.006 --> 12:57.635
It wasn't them,
but I'm sure you boys already knew that.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.706
All their vics were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.

13:01.814 --> 13:02.872
So, it wasn't them,

13:02.982 --> 13:06.042
which makes this a local matter
and falls under our jurisdiction.

13:06.152 --> 13:10.384
So, with all due respect,
we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.

13:12.325 --> 13:16.386
"With all due respect."
Man, I hate it when people say that,

13:16.496 --> 13:19.897
because it is inevitably followed
by a disrespectful remark.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.263
Here, let me give you an example.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.462
With all due respect, Detective,

13:25.605 --> 13:30.133
this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction

13:30.710 --> 13:32.837
I fucking say it does.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.176
-You fucking.. .
-Let's just.. .

13:38.618 --> 13:40.950
What can you tell us about the shooters?

13:41.053 --> 13:43.681
"Shooter." Singular.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.922
And I can tell you.. .

13:47.026 --> 13:50.928
How shall I put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.127
One guy. Dwarf. Got it.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.935
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.472
Detective Greenly,

14:07.179 --> 14:08.612
you're the victim.

14:08.714 --> 14:11.706
David. You can call me David.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.149
Very well, David.

14:15.488 --> 14:19.219
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel eight years ago.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.719
Two men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees

14:22.862 --> 14:25.956
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.068
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.331
Eyes front, David.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.877
The position of the victim and the angles
produced by the killers' stance

14:39.011 --> 14:40.876
created a unique scenario.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.743
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

14:43.883 --> 14:48.047
Here, this did not occur.
The rounds moved on a straight trajectory

14:48.187 --> 14:51.418
through the back of the victim's head
and out the front,

14:51.557 --> 14:53.650
which happens when.. .

14:53.759 --> 14:57.195
One guy's holding two guns
to the back of your head.

14:59.298 --> 15:00.356
One guy.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.509
But you said he was wicked short.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.949
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'11" tall.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.884
The rounds exit Petrova's eyeballs.

15:24.156 --> 15:29.617
Here, they came out the lower cheek,
three, four inches below the eyes.

15:29.795 --> 15:34.858
That puts him at 5'7"-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.435
The killer posed as a late-night confessor.

15:38.571 --> 15:43.235
Once the victim entered the booth,
the killer had him isolated. No escape.

15:43.409 --> 15:47.243
Short stuff comes out of the confessional,
kicks in the door of the priest's chambers,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.780
leaving a crescent-shaped indentation,

15:49.915 --> 15:53.646
<i>which tells us that this cowboy
was wearing a boot with a pronounced heel.</i>

15:53.786 --> 15:55.651
<i>Gave him a couple inches.</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:57.551
<i>We're looking about 5'5", gentlemen.</i>

15:58.324 --> 16:00.815
-That's wicked short.
-Wicked.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.125
<i>Speculation on the Saints'
possible involvement</i>

16:04.263 --> 16:06.993
<i>in the murder of Father Douglas McKinney
continues to boil over.</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:09.727
<i>ln fact, it has split the public
right down the middle.</i>

16:10.036 --> 16:13.597
<i>My cousin was there. He saw the body.
His hands were crossed over his chest.</i>

16:13.706 --> 16:14.764
<i>It was them.</i>

16:14.874 --> 16:17.843
<i>-It wasn't them.
-You know, maybe the priest did something.</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:20.775
<i>There were pennies in his eyes, they did it.</i>

16:21.113 --> 16:22.774
<i>-They didn't do it.
-It wasn't them.</i>

16:30.556 --> 16:32.683
<i>-You're on the air, caller.
-Well, finally, man, yeah.</i>

16:32.825 --> 16:35.953
<i>This guy was indicted last year
for ordering the murders of 22 people.</i>

16:36.062 --> 16:38.428
<i>And it slid right off his back. Piece of shit!</i>

16:38.531 --> 16:42.763
<i>lndeed, Boston has been under
the terrible reign of this thug for years now.</i>

16:42.868 --> 16:44.267
<i>Where's the DA's office?</i>

16:44.370 --> 16:48.101
<i>Why can't they make anything stick
to Concezio Yakavetta?</i>

16:52.078 --> 16:55.639
I can't believe
that none of us were consulted on this!

16:56.215 --> 16:57.773
The disrespect!

16:58.517 --> 17:02.851
<i>We never would have okayed such a thing.
A priest! It's infamità!</i>

17:02.988 --> 17:07.185
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!

17:07.326 --> 17:12.229
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business in it, Concezio.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.955
The cops. They can be all over us.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.001
Forget the cops.
What about these Saints fuckers?

17:17.103 --> 17:18.900
These guys were long gone,

17:19.038 --> 17:21.563
and now you're trying to bring the devil
right back to our doorstep?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.732
Eight years ago,

17:25.444 --> 17:29.574
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees

17:31.684 --> 17:33.413
<i>and executed him</i>

17:35.287 --> 17:37.152
in public.

17:41.460 --> 17:47.831
<i>Mi padrino, a blood relative
and benedictator to all of you.</i>

17:52.304 --> 17:56.741
You think that I don't know
that each one of you

17:57.743 --> 18:02.077
has been waking up with the night sweats
over this for eight years?

18:03.816 --> 18:08.185
These sons of bitches prison-fucked us!

18:09.121 --> 18:10.782
ln the ass!

18:10.923 --> 18:14.518
And then they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!

18:16.662 --> 18:22.100
And we have been living in silent fear
ever since.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.037
We don't talk about it.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.933
Rape victims seldom do.

18:32.511 --> 18:37.471
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't got a problem

18:38.918 --> 18:40.579
don't solve nothing.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.817
Let's take a moment

18:45.991 --> 18:49.119
and look at the serendiculous.. .

18:49.261 --> 18:51.923
Seren.. . Seren.. . Seren.. .

18:52.031 --> 18:53.555
Serendipitous.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.831
...type situation we find ourselves in.

19:01.207 --> 19:05.234
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints are gonna show.

19:06.712 --> 19:10.842
And this time,
they don't catch us with our pants down.

19:12.151 --> 19:18.647
This time, we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.650
And don't forget Boston's finest.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.929
With their second bite at the apple

19:26.031 --> 19:29.831
they've got every reason in the world
to crank up the heat.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.628
And as for the Saints' doting fans,

19:33.839 --> 19:34.828
fuck them!

19:47.853 --> 19:48.877
Bad luck.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.989
How would he even recognize us?

19:52.091 --> 19:54.184
You don't remember the fucking sketches
on the news channel?

19:54.326 --> 19:56.055
-Shit, that's right.
-Fuck's sake.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.787
You know,
every time you see those composites on TV

19:57.897 --> 20:00.991
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.858
-But ours.. .
-Just our luck, right?

20:04.370 --> 20:07.828
We draw Leonardo fucking da Vinci
as a sketch artist.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.042
And two days ago,
we looked like Jesus Christ.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.475
-What the fuck we cut our hair for?
-Yeah, that's right.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.416
I don't know, it seemed like the thing to do
at the time, though, didn't it?

20:19.551 --> 20:22.384
-Maybe we should dye it.
-What?

20:23.422 --> 20:26.687
<i>Well, they're always dying their hair
in the movies, like The Fugitive.</i>

20:26.792 --> 20:28.760
It's covert and shit.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.825
What color would you dye it?

20:35.034 --> 20:37.161
Lighter, I guess.

20:37.269 --> 20:41.228
-Do you mean blonde?
-I didn't fucking say that.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.204
Like California surfer boy.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.869
-It's not what I'm saying.
-Like gay, gay, gay,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.411
-faggoty blonde.
-I'm fucking warning you!

20:47.546 --> 20:49.343
-"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"
-I'm fucking warning you!

20:49.448 --> 20:51.245
-"Stay gold.. ."
-Fuck you!

20:51.383 --> 20:52.873
You fucking cunt!

20:52.985 --> 20:54.612
Jesus fucking Christ!

20:54.753 --> 20:56.015
-Well, I was fucking mad!
-Shit!

20:56.121 --> 20:58.248
What kind of fucking crazy.. .

21:00.926 --> 21:04.794
-I know who you are. You guys are.. .
-Shut it!

21:04.930 --> 21:07.421
This is so fucking cool, man!

21:07.566 --> 21:10.399
I'm from Boston and I love you guys.
Shit, everybody loves you guys.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.528
<i>Maybe I can get on this thing.
You know, bring some raza into this.</i>

21:13.639 --> 21:18.235
Hey, is it true that you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?

21:28.420 --> 21:31.787
And an awesome wailing
was heard throughout heaven.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.223
And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

21:35.327 --> 21:39.229
And as Almighty God created you,

21:41.700 --> 21:45.466
now he calleth you home!

21:52.678 --> 21:55.806
Busy signal. Will have to call us back.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.344
Let's have a shot while we're waiting.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.689
-I think he took a little piss.
-That shit was not funny!

22:06.825 --> 22:10.090
It just came out me fucking nose.

22:10.195 --> 22:13.961
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought I greased my drawers.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.032
No.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.939
I've got connects all over Beantown, man.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.343
Romeo will hook you up like a tow truck.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.710
-No.
-Why not?

22:30.849 --> 22:34.285
We don't have to give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.

22:34.386 --> 22:35.785
It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it?

22:35.921 --> 22:38.822
How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing?

22:38.924 --> 22:43.156
The fact that you're a greasy spic,
it's got nothing to do with it.

22:43.729 --> 22:46.220
Okay, I'm gonna let you have that one,
but, look, I can do this.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.957
This isn't rocket surgery.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.060
You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff and you kill them, right?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.172
Well, it's not that simple, actually.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.833
-Yes, it is.
-Suppose you're right.

22:57.676 --> 23:02.010
I was just hoping that we was
a bit more artistic about it, I think.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.014
Yeah? Well, you ain't.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.581
Now, what do you plan on doing
when you get to US soil?

23:10.089 --> 23:16.085
We don't really have, you know,
a succinct plan yet, you know, per se.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.356
Haven't really worked it all out, as it were.

23:19.465 --> 23:23.902
As it were. Not fully developed, per se.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.766
You two leprechaun dicks need to chill
in the greenroom

23:26.905 --> 23:31.171
sipping on some Pellegrino
and let your manager handle the details.

23:31.276 --> 23:33.938
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.070
Because if you wanna kick Yakavetta
in the nuts,

23:36.215 --> 23:39.446
have him wake up
with a horse head in his bed,

23:39.585 --> 23:42.452
Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you.

23:47.126 --> 23:51.187
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points in the same direction.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.430
Get out.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.140
Look, I have been stonewalling
the media on this thing.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.145
I've got half of New England
thinking the Saints whacked the priest

24:09.281 --> 24:12.717
and the other half thinking they're innocent.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.718
It's a powder keg.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.278
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.

24:19.091 --> 24:24.051
Now, I can clear them of this murder
and take the piss right out of this thing.

24:24.930 --> 24:29.162
Now, give me one reason
why I shouldn't take this public right now.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.997
Walk with me, Chief. Let's talk.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.576
This is not good.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.180
She's gunning for the boys hard.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.757
This broad trying to put a feather in her cap
is gonna get us all locked up.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.258
-I mean, this couldn't be going any worse.
-Just calm down.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.852
Calm down? Calm down? You know
they're gonna throw us in the Hoag.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.192
We put half those deranged sex freaks
in there.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.198
I hope you guys like cock sandwiches,

25:03.335 --> 25:06.099
because we'll be eating them for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!

25:06.972 --> 25:09.532
Now, I understand
you've got a job to do, Chief.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.540
But this pint-sized killer is the only thing

25:11.677 --> 25:13.770
that puts Yakavetta
right in the middle of this.

25:13.879 --> 25:16.712
And if Concezio even sniffs
that we on to him,

25:16.848 --> 25:18.816
he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head,

25:18.917 --> 25:22.045
plants him at the bottom of the ocean
and walks.

25:22.187 --> 25:26.556
Now it is imperative
that we find this little man.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.993
You have said some dumb shit in your days,
but that.. . I.. . You know, that.. . That.. .

26:03.095 --> 26:05.996
What? We're all "assuming"
Smecker didn't tell her.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.931
"Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and three Boston detectives

26:09.067 --> 26:11.035
"are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar."

26:11.136 --> 26:13.764
Smecker may have been a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.341
-And we took an oath. The four of us!
-Yeah!

26:17.442 --> 26:20.673
-Okay! I was just thinking.
-Well, don't do that.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.041
-You're no good at it.
-Fuck you!

26:22.147 --> 26:23.273
You're as dumb as a fucking heel,

26:23.415 --> 26:25.349
-you know that, you blowjob?
-Fucking, cocksucking, hard-on.. .

26:25.450 --> 26:29.181
Jesus Christ! Look!
We need to figure out what we're gonna do

26:29.288 --> 26:32.257
when the boys show
and start doing what they do best.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.450
Because that's when the shit's
really gonna hit the fan!

26:34.593 --> 26:37.061
But everyone is assuming
that the boys are gonna turn up.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.926
We got no way of knowing that for sure.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.364
Yeah, that could totally happen.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.363
They could not come back.

26:49.641 --> 26:53.304
What dream world did you two
just slip into?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.140
We know the boys.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.740
Is there any part of you
that thinks they're just gonna let this slide?

27:00.519 --> 27:02.043
Believe this.

27:02.688 --> 27:06.146
They're either on their way
or they're already here.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.958
I thought you said your car
was inconspicuous.

27:18.103 --> 27:22.096
Yeah, well, I don't like words
with "spic" right in the middle.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.835
Besides, it is where I live.

27:25.444 --> 27:28.345
Yeah? Where's that? Margaritaville?

27:28.480 --> 27:31.142
Hey, I hail from a colorful people.

27:32.117 --> 27:36.451
Besides, you wouldn't know style
if it pitched a tent in your ass.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.321
Ace in the hole time.

27:40.459 --> 27:44.293
Been a lot of chatter about Yakavetta
being in bed with the Chinese.

27:44.396 --> 27:47.331
<i>This here is little Yaka's yeyo.</i>

27:50.869 --> 27:52.598
All right, here's the plan.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.533
Then we skin out,
we go to Doc's for a shot of lrish,

28:59.638 --> 29:01.936
we're at home in time for tacos.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.734
That's what we do.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.568
-What?
-Well, it's just this plan.. .

29:08.713 --> 29:10.078
-What the fuck's wrong with the plan?
-It's.. .

29:10.215 --> 29:13.548
It's genius. I can even drive an f-lift, man.

29:13.652 --> 29:17.520
-Got my Class D license and everything.
-That's the fucking spirit!

29:17.622 --> 29:19.453
I'm gonna need a gun.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.350
-Forget it.
-Forget it.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.226
What the fuck, man? I'm in on this shit.
I'm working here!

29:27.165 --> 29:29.360
-Okay.
-For fuck's sake!

29:30.101 --> 29:31.466
Here's what you're gonna do.

29:31.603 --> 29:36.370
You're gonna consider yourself
a fucking pledge until we tell you different.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.607
Can I consider myself your girlfriend, too?

29:42.747 --> 29:45.944
That's what you get.
Is there a fucking problem?

29:47.652 --> 29:49.085
It's fine.

29:50.255 --> 29:51.779
I'm fucking watching you.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.790
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.557
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this, it builds character.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.393
Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.067
Now, that's just unprofessional.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.837
So, what do you think?

30:10.775 --> 30:14.734
I think Yakavetta killed a good man
just to send us a message.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.007
Well, let's send him one right back.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.256
<i>Motoring</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:39.303
<i>...night</i>

30:43.208 --> 30:44.470
<i>...right</i>

30:45.844 --> 30:49.780
<i>And something that rhymes with "light"</i>

30:52.250 --> 30:54.343
-Why?
-I don't know.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.516
It's not them.

31:03.995 --> 31:05.326
It's them.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.230
A wise man once told me,

31:09.367 --> 31:13.895
"Where a man's actions are firmly bound
to an unshakable faith,

31:14.039 --> 31:18.806
"one's worst nightmares become sudden,
terrifying reality."

31:20.245 --> 31:22.406
You didn't have to bash me in the skull!

31:22.547 --> 31:25.243
Sorry, man, we got a plan going here.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.408
Technically, I was supposed
to knock you out.

31:27.552 --> 31:31.420
But they gave me this faggoty little gun,
see, and the weight's just not.. .

31:31.556 --> 31:33.251
Christ, that's a gun?

31:33.391 --> 31:36.883
Why didn't you just point it at me
and say "scram"?

31:37.028 --> 31:40.259
-Scram! Get the fuck out of here! Now!
-You got it!

31:40.966 --> 31:43.594
Hey, guys, let's not let this one little incident
get in the way of.. .

31:43.735 --> 31:46.260
Shut up
and get back behind the fucking wheel!

31:46.404 --> 31:48.065
-Jeez!
-Well,

31:48.440 --> 31:51.876
-at least your plan's off to a winning start.
-Go fuck yourself.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.710
Oh, fuck.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.088
That's heroin.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.731
-How the fuck would you know?
-Fuck you. I know shit.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.134
What's the symbolism here?

32:27.112 --> 32:30.980
-Symbolism?
-Yeah. What does this symbolize?

32:32.150 --> 32:35.916
Well, it symbolizes a huge fuck-up.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.385
This is a plan that fell to pieces.

32:39.491 --> 32:44.656
A lot of it don't make sense,
which is why it all makes perfect sense.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.599
-Christ, what the fuck's he doing?
-I don't know. Hang on!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.167
Fuck's sake.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.303
All right, all right.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.840
Christ, he can't fucking see
where he's going!

32:59.811 --> 33:02.905
Shit! Turn to the left now! Tell him!

33:03.014 --> 33:05.505
-Go left! Go left!
-What?

33:06.117 --> 33:08.847
-That way! Go that way!
-Left? Fuck!

33:11.289 --> 33:14.986
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Fucking stupid plan.

33:15.126 --> 33:18.653
It's all in the execution.
And your negative attitude ain't helping any!

33:18.797 --> 33:21.288
-What? What the fuck?
-Negative attitude?

33:21.399 --> 33:23.663
-My fucking negative attitude?
-Yeah, your negative attitude!

33:23.802 --> 33:28.830
You've got to visualize the end result!
You've got to force it into reality! Believe!

33:28.973 --> 33:30.167
You've got to fucking believe!

33:30.308 --> 33:32.776
I'm about to believe my fist
right up your fucking ass!

33:32.877 --> 33:34.435
You'll do what?

33:36.147 --> 33:37.774
-Not a believer!
-That's another thing,

33:37.882 --> 33:40.214
don't be down at me,
'cause I'm right fucking there, man!

33:42.353 --> 33:44.548
You've got to believe!

33:44.689 --> 33:46.680
This bitch is fast-a-rooney.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.117
Wait.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.828
-Wait. Wait, wait, hold on.
-Uppey-downey!

33:53.565 --> 33:54.862
Shit!

34:05.910 --> 34:09.346
Boys, I believe things in our fair, little city

34:10.614 --> 34:13.413
<i>just got downright biblical.</i>

34:17.554 --> 34:19.181
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

35:00.431 --> 35:03.525
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.933
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,

35:06.070 --> 35:08.197
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

35:08.306 --> 35:12.470
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.460
<i>While the wicked stand confounded,</i>

35:31.629 --> 35:34.427
<i>call me with Thy Saints surrounded.</i>

35:39.504 --> 35:41.734
Ballistics just dug it out.

35:43.308 --> 35:49.008
A.22? You've got to be kidding me.
That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

35:49.347 --> 35:54.944
Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun
to a gunfight.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.117
I don't know.

35:58.223 --> 36:01.590
Ballistics is reading three shooters,
and this is one of them.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.856
I find it hard to believe that one of the three
most lethal individuals on the planet

36:04.996 --> 36:06.793
just switched over to birdshot.

36:06.898 --> 36:11.335
Maybe we're reading this wrong.
Priest was a frame job, right?

36:11.469 --> 36:14.927
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying
to eliminate some competition here?

36:15.039 --> 36:16.199
Yeah.

36:25.717 --> 36:26.979
No, sir, it's them.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.842
Here he comes.

36:30.922 --> 36:31.980
-Doc!
-Doc!

36:32.090 --> 36:33.682
Boys!

36:33.825 --> 36:38.023
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Come on in here with that. Get in quick.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.725
Get in out of the cold. Come on.

36:41.199 --> 36:46.330
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I saw the news channel.

36:46.437 --> 36:49.634
-Are you boys all right?
-Sound as an lrish pound, Doc.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.904
-Is it too late for a shot?
-The Lord told me you'd be coming.

36:53.044 --> 36:57.674
"Doc," he said. "They'd be coming."
And I was to have everything ready.

36:57.782 --> 37:01.013
And I have. I have everything.. .

37:01.586 --> 37:03.019
It's all set.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.519
This is our Mexican.

37:07.425 --> 37:11.384
Nice to meet you, lad. They call me.. .
Fuck! Ass!

37:13.464 --> 37:15.557
How you doing, Fuck Ass? I'm Romeo.

37:16.935 --> 37:23.431
This used to be a speakeasy in the '40s.
I only use it for storage now.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.276
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

37:30.248 --> 37:35.049
-This is so fucking cool!
-Nobody knows it's up here. You'll be safe.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.521
You can get in and out the fire escape.

37:40.725 --> 37:45.355
Know what this is? This is our hideout.
We got a fucking hideout, man!

37:46.597 --> 37:49.122
What, are you fucking five years old?

37:49.267 --> 37:54.227
You know, Rome,
we got sticks and blankets.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.432
You can make yourself a fort.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.371
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.

37:58.476 --> 38:00.307
We even got pinball machines, man.

38:23.468 --> 38:27.302
Lobster dick! Look at me! Lobster dick!

38:41.986 --> 38:44.318
Not this time, you little shit.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.821
We'll see about that, old man.

38:49.560 --> 38:54.327
Would somebody
please come over here and.. .

38:54.465 --> 38:55.955
-Fuck!
-Me up the.. .

38:56.067 --> 38:58.092
-Ass!
-Yes! That's what he done!

38:58.202 --> 39:02.866
That's what he's done every time!
I took you down, old man, I took you down!

39:31.202 --> 39:35.070
Are you hungry, lad?
I sent Louie out for some sandwiches.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.707
I could eat.

39:38.342 --> 39:39.741
Decent work.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.144
Do you know what I'm thinking
would be a nice match for the back?

39:43.247 --> 39:45.738
That chocolate hide with the heavy marbling

39:45.883 --> 39:48.317
we've been trying to get rid of
for the last six months.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.887
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.248
Go to it, lad.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.195
I can't help you with that, lads.

40:05.303 --> 40:09.501
But if you need something, anything,
made out of leather,

40:10.808 --> 40:11.900
we'd be happy to do the job.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.441
How many times have I been nice to you?

40:20.585 --> 40:23.179
How many times do my people come here
and talk to you?

40:23.287 --> 40:26.745
This song and dance is over.
It's over, motherfucker!

40:28.226 --> 40:29.693
You didn't see anything!

40:39.137 --> 40:40.365
Noah!

40:43.975 --> 40:46.944
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

40:48.146 --> 40:51.912
<i>We got to call the polizia, Noah!
We got to call somebody.</i>

40:54.252 --> 40:55.913
Noah! No.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.668
You young guys worry too much.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.639
We always bounce back.

41:20.178 --> 41:24.444
Besides, better the chinks than us, right?

41:29.387 --> 41:31.753
This is some serious shit here!

41:33.491 --> 41:36.187
Something amusing you, queer bait?

41:36.327 --> 41:40.127
-No, I was just.. .
-You should be focused on the next step!

41:42.333 --> 41:46.963
That shipment of H was gonna
square our books for the next six months!

41:48.339 --> 41:52.298
-Any thoughts on that?
-Yeah, I got some thoughts on that.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.179
I was just thinking,
not too serendipitous for us.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.543
You.. .

41:59.217 --> 42:03.984
It's like the Roman Empire in here.
You even got concubines and shit.

42:04.689 --> 42:10.889
-George. What gives here?
-A little cannoli, shrimp cocktail, huh?

42:11.696 --> 42:14.187
I need to see the boss, right away.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.459
<i>Jimmy the Gofer, la cortina.</i>

42:21.706 --> 42:23.196
<i>Get over here.</i>

42:25.176 --> 42:27.337
Hey, boss, I just came by to tell you.. .

42:27.445 --> 42:31.176
<i>Push the talk button, numb nuts!</i>

42:32.183 --> 42:34.310
Hello, can you hear me? Over.

42:34.418 --> 42:37.216
<i>I can hear you fine.
Now what the fuck are you doing here?</i>

42:37.355 --> 42:39.721
Copy that. Everything's in motion.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.189
All our guys
are gunning for these Jesus freaks.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.057
I figure there's no need for me to be
on the streets no more.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.221
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?

42:47.365 --> 42:52.268
<i>Are your ears fucking painted on?
Did I not make it perfectly clear</i>

42:52.403 --> 42:54.564
<i>that you're to stay on the streets
until this is over?</i>

42:54.705 --> 42:57.230
<i>-I was.. .
-Now get the fuck out of here!</i>

42:57.375 --> 42:59.036
<i>Douche bag!</i>

42:59.143 --> 43:03.375
<i>And don't come back till I say you can
or you're going back to Brooklyn,</i>

43:03.981 --> 43:06.347
<i>you fat fucking waste of space!</i>

43:07.218 --> 43:10.346
<i>You wanna find something in Boston
that don't wanna be found,</i>

43:10.454 --> 43:13.048
<i>my Uncle Cesar is a veterano.</i>

43:13.157 --> 43:15.955
<i>Out the game, but still got his name.</i>

43:16.093 --> 43:19.620
<i>Yakavetta's gunning for you muchachos,
and hard.</i>

43:19.764 --> 43:24.531
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.

43:25.436 --> 43:30.874
Anyway, any of his guys that take you out
gets his palm crossed.

43:31.909 --> 43:34.810
Two hundred and fifty big ones.

43:37.481 --> 43:39.244
Quarter mil for us?

43:39.817 --> 43:42.217
"Us"? What are you talking about, "us"?

43:42.853 --> 43:47.085
Uncle, why do you disrespect me
in front of my friends?

43:48.025 --> 43:50.459
I'm disrespecting you?

43:51.295 --> 43:54.628
A year ago
you were washing my pots and pans.

43:55.099 --> 43:58.626
Well, I don't wash
fucking pots and pans anymore.

43:58.769 --> 44:01.169
I'm a part of this Uncle.

44:01.605 --> 44:05.063
Nephew, this is not my first barbeque.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.769
He's with us.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.642
Is he?

44:15.319 --> 44:19.255
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?

44:20.491 --> 44:21.958
A lot of heart.

44:28.499 --> 44:34.267
<i>Ahora, Gorgeous George is running
the show right now for little Yaka.</i>

44:34.372 --> 44:39.810
<i>And if anyone knows where he is,
it's that fat, fucking ugly perico.</i>

44:41.312 --> 44:43.371
I'll get it out on the wire.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.899
Anybody hungry?

45:04.034 --> 45:06.798
-Maybe we should stop at an lHOP or.. .
-Shut up!

45:06.904 --> 45:08.462
Romeo's crying.

45:10.408 --> 45:12.205
Fucking assholes!

45:16.013 --> 45:17.037
Shut up!

45:27.091 --> 45:28.558
Oh, yeah.

45:36.333 --> 45:38.426
Yeah, that feels good.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.577
Somebody had their Wheaties this morning.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.948
Yeah, get after it, girl.

45:56.987 --> 45:58.420
Oh, that's good.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.491
Hey, let's keep this professional, baby.

46:03.627 --> 46:07.324
No offense,
but I don't need you calling me all the time.

46:10.034 --> 46:13.936
What the fuck!
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch!

46:18.375 --> 46:21.310
What the fuck did you just say to me?

46:22.379 --> 46:24.779
I'm sorry I called you that.

46:24.882 --> 46:29.012
How courteous of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important, don't you agree?

46:31.889 --> 46:34.119
Yeah. Yeah, I'm down with that.

46:34.225 --> 46:38.127
Good. Now sit your fat ass down.

46:54.178 --> 46:58.012
Where is Concezio Yakavetta?

46:58.682 --> 47:02.618
-I don't know.
-Yeah, there's a lot you don't know, hoss.

47:03.220 --> 47:07.122
For instance,
you're the only New York guy, George.

47:07.224 --> 47:10.523
Your blood just ain't quite as blue
as the rest of them, is it?

47:10.661 --> 47:13.323
Explains why you ain't safely tucked away
in some ivory tower

47:13.430 --> 47:17.560
with the rest of them bigwigs sucking on
cannoli and cocktail shrimp right now.

47:17.701 --> 47:21.159
That's why you're the one
he left on the streets, George.

47:21.272 --> 47:24.139
Like you know shit all of a sudden.

47:24.241 --> 47:26.573
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.

47:26.710 --> 47:31.477
-Somebody's got to be out there making.. .
-Someone's got to chum the waters.

47:33.551 --> 47:36.918
Bullshit! And I ain't saying
another fucking word to you!

47:37.054 --> 47:39.249
Good. You can just listen.

47:39.390 --> 47:42.223
We know Concezio had that priest killed.

47:44.228 --> 47:47.197
That's another thing you don't know,
I reckon.

47:47.398 --> 47:50.094
But then why would he tell you
that, George?

47:50.234 --> 47:52.930
You and your boys on the street,

47:53.070 --> 47:54.697
y'all is bait.

47:55.606 --> 47:57.437
Gorgeous George, huh?

47:57.942 --> 48:00.433
Expendable George is more like it.

48:04.281 --> 48:08.081
By the by, you've got a pretty nice ass
for a fat man.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.784
A priest. Sick fuck, huh?

48:14.925 --> 48:17.416
So, until the Saints get popped,
we're all lambs to the slaughter.

48:18.495 --> 48:21.623
And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime.

48:21.765 --> 48:24.131
What do you need me to do, Skip?

48:25.436 --> 48:27.734
<i>-Down the brugliones.
-What, everyone?</i>

48:27.838 --> 48:29.863
North and South?
That could get a little dicey.

48:29.974 --> 48:33.000
-Fuck their old grudges! They're all in this!
-Grudges have nothing to do with it.

48:33.110 --> 48:34.407
-You know I don't take sides.
-I don't care, Jo Jo!

48:34.511 --> 48:35.535
-You know I don't.
-You don't take sides?

48:35.646 --> 48:36.738
-Never me! Never me!
-You don't take sides?

48:36.847 --> 48:38.712
You're gonna take my fucking side
on this, Jo Jo!

48:38.816 --> 48:40.613
-You talk to that mick Jimmy Green.
-Here we go again.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.584
-Jimmy'll tell you that!
-Jimmy Green! Jimmy Green!

48:43.687 --> 48:47.384
I don't care if Jimmy Green hollowed out
your sister like a Chippewa lndian!

48:47.491 --> 48:48.958
You're gonna get in there, Jo Jo,

48:49.093 --> 48:51.493
and you're gonna middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,

48:51.629 --> 48:53.563
and you're not gonna fuck it up!

48:53.664 --> 48:56.258
You tell them everything that we discussed!

48:56.367 --> 48:58.460
Even the panic room thing?

48:59.637 --> 49:00.661
Sure.

49:00.804 --> 49:03.637
Good. Because that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.241
You know,
I didn't even know those things were real.

49:05.342 --> 49:07.776
I thought they made that up for that movie.

49:07.878 --> 49:10.312
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?

49:10.447 --> 49:12.278
The guys in the house?

49:12.383 --> 49:14.977
<i>Panic... Panic Room?</i>

49:15.119 --> 49:17.747
-No, the other one.
-Stop fucking around!

49:17.855 --> 49:21.484
This is serious shit here, Jo Jo!
You tell them we meet tomorrow night.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.149
-All right.
-I'll call you with the fucking location.

49:23.293 --> 49:25.784
-Okay.
-Fucking thing.

49:52.256 --> 49:54.190
Come on, kid. It was a fucking.. .

49:54.692 --> 49:56.159
It was a fucking accident.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.525
We can work this out.

50:02.566 --> 50:04.534
He ain't gonna do shit.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.737
You're ltalian Kid.

50:08.105 --> 50:09.697
Help us out here.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.068
Think it over.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.642
I am his friend.

50:14.211 --> 50:18.079
Fuck him and fuck his friend.
Deal the cards! He ain't got the balls.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.927
What did we do?

51:07.064 --> 51:08.258
Connor.

51:21.478 --> 51:24.743
God! No!

51:38.796 --> 51:41.162
Why did they use his mug shot?

51:43.500 --> 51:44.990
What? No.

51:47.004 --> 51:49.802
Yeah, you remember
when he said he was all embarrassed

51:49.940 --> 51:53.740
because that fellow had to hold up
all his long hair behind his head?

51:53.844 --> 51:54.936
Aye.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.346
That's an arm.

52:03.153 --> 52:04.518
Hey, Rocco!

52:06.223 --> 52:07.747
<i>I got the info you wanted, mijo.</i>

52:08.225 --> 52:12.491
The place is called
Tando's Tanning Salon on Bunker Hill.

52:12.629 --> 52:15.427
<i>That's where the fucking güero
gets his fake bake at.</i>

52:20.537 --> 52:24.940
European cut. Far superior.

52:27.678 --> 52:31.808
<i>Yeah! You've just been paid
So split now</i>

52:33.550 --> 52:37.850
Lovely singing voice there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.

52:38.222 --> 52:40.213
Can you do that for me?

52:40.357 --> 52:42.723
Can you do that for me?

52:47.764 --> 52:51.359
It's getting hard to be a gentleman
of fucking leisure around here!

52:53.537 --> 52:56.506
I want the name of the shooter
you motherfuckers used on that priest!

52:56.607 --> 52:58.131
What priest?

52:58.242 --> 52:59.402
His fucking name!

52:59.543 --> 53:01.977
-I don't know who it is!
-That's fucking bullshit!

53:02.079 --> 53:04.547
It's the truth! Concezio didn't tell nobody
what he was doing

53:04.681 --> 53:06.148
'cause he knew
nobody would have okayed it!

53:06.250 --> 53:10.516
The shooter's an independent contractor!
That's all I fucking know!

53:10.621 --> 53:13.351
Where the fuck is Yakavetta hiding?

53:13.457 --> 53:16.858
Prudential Building, 40th floor.

53:17.294 --> 53:18.818
Jesus Christ!

53:23.367 --> 53:25.164
You meeting someone tonight?

53:26.136 --> 53:29.264
Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street guys.

53:30.307 --> 53:34.209
Your kind of guys.
You could take a real bite out of crime here.

53:34.311 --> 53:36.575
-And I can help you.
-What the fuck is that?

53:36.713 --> 53:39.580
Nobody forgot
what you guys did to us last time.

53:39.716 --> 53:43.015
Everybody's hiding indoors.
They give out the location an hour before.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.248
My uncle's place is closed tonight.
I got the key.

53:46.823 --> 53:49.758
How does Mexican work for you, George?
Do you like that?

53:49.893 --> 53:54.887
Doesn't matter to me.
I think I just shit my European-cut Speedos.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.200
-What's this?
-Rosary bead.

53:59.303 --> 54:01.396
Found it pushed under the carpet
near the victim.

54:01.505 --> 54:06.272
Father McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary,
so it's probably been there a while.

54:09.446 --> 54:13.542
The results on all 864 prints
found at the scene.

54:13.650 --> 54:16.881
All matched churchgoers and clergy but one.

54:18.288 --> 54:22.054
Partial on the priest's watch
is still unidentified.

54:22.159 --> 54:26.789
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets printed nowadays.

54:26.930 --> 54:30.991
They even are inking up these snot gobblers
in kindergarten now.

54:31.134 --> 54:33.500
It's a brick wall anyway.

54:33.637 --> 54:38.165
We know Napoleon was wearing gloves.
The lab got zilch on the lock and chain.

54:38.308 --> 54:40.776
Even the pennies came up clean.

54:40.877 --> 54:43.107
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

54:45.048 --> 54:49.485
Man. Daddy would knock that out
like Mike fucking Tyson.

54:50.821 --> 54:53.289
-Hey!
-What? I didn't say nothing.

54:54.691 --> 54:58.092
McKinney wore his watch on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?

54:58.195 --> 55:00.663
Right here, off his left elbow.

55:00.797 --> 55:03.357
Just occurred to me that priests
wear the rosary while taking confession.

55:03.500 --> 55:04.990
-She's right.
-Dolly, get on the phone

55:05.135 --> 55:07.000
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.196
Duffy, push that partial through the DMV.

55:09.339 --> 55:11.466
David, you put it through lnterpol
just to get an lD now.

55:11.575 --> 55:13.475
Come on, vamoose!

55:23.720 --> 55:26.848
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?

55:26.990 --> 55:31.518
Now why would you go
and do a damn fool thing like that?

56:11.935 --> 56:13.732
Just two more to go.

56:14.604 --> 56:17.038
You guys are gonna let me go, right?

56:17.140 --> 56:20.541
I guess we'll just have to wait and see,
won't we?

56:20.644 --> 56:24.239
Jesus Christ, this is some embarrassing shit.

56:24.981 --> 56:28.917
Don't worry. We worked on a sheep farm.
Smelled way worse.

56:29.653 --> 56:32.178
Although that is right up there.

56:36.326 --> 56:40.092
<i>Yo, spicaroo.
More nachos and más salsa, capisci?</i>

56:40.564 --> 56:43.089
Hey, and I need a refill here, pepe.

56:47.604 --> 56:49.765
Easy! Jesus!

56:52.909 --> 56:55.400
-How do, David?
-Hey!

56:56.346 --> 56:59.543
<i>We just dumped a text message
from George's cell. Just two words.</i>

57:00.417 --> 57:04.251
"Silver Peso."
It's a Mexican joint down by the docks.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.716
Sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama.

57:07.824 --> 57:10.486
Guess gangsters got to eat, too, huh?

57:11.194 --> 57:15.153
I think I'll drop in on their little supper,
see if I can shake things up a bit.

57:16.166 --> 57:17.895
Need a bodyguard?

57:18.768 --> 57:21.259
No, thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye, now.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.132
Bye.

57:31.314 --> 57:35.808
These dagos are getting antsy, man.
I'm getting spicarooed and pepe'd.

57:35.952 --> 57:38.477
All right, calm the fuck down.

57:39.556 --> 57:42.684
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.

57:46.663 --> 57:48.927
He is not with them.

57:49.499 --> 57:51.330
It is only the sons.

57:52.235 --> 57:54.465
They have a Spaniard with them.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.536
They will slaughter everyone.

57:57.340 --> 57:59.308
Let them.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.637
If you kill the sons.. .

58:01.978 --> 58:03.639
...the father will come.

58:08.752 --> 58:10.151
Gentlemen.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.319
All right. The gang's all here.

58:16.026 --> 58:18.119
Give me my fucking BB gun.

58:19.896 --> 58:22.558
No, Rome. You've earned your stripes.

58:28.038 --> 58:30.063
Hey, tighten it up.

58:34.878 --> 58:35.902
So?

58:40.917 --> 58:42.578
Where's Gorgeous?

58:47.958 --> 58:49.516
Is that George?

58:55.065 --> 58:56.999
What the fuck is that?

58:57.100 --> 58:58.727
It's lrish for, "You're fucked."

59:03.540 --> 59:05.667
<i>Que viva México, bitches!</i>

59:39.943 --> 59:41.069
I've seen the light!

59:41.177 --> 59:45.204
You guys have really turned me around
on this. I'm, like, born again and shit!

59:45.315 --> 59:47.146
Should we let him go?

59:50.420 --> 59:53.082
You know what I think we should do?

59:53.189 --> 59:56.488
I think we should let God decide
if he gets a second chance.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.457
What the fuck you doing?

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.995
What the.. . No, man, come on.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:05.099
Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.738
You had best be right with your Jesus, boy.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:24.915
Well! Praise be to Jesus!

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.492
-Georgie.
-Yeah?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.189
You know all good boys go to heaven.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:41.632
You know, that was perhaps one of
the finest examples of spiritual guidance

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.003
-I've ever had the good fortune to witness.
-It was wonderful, wasn't it?

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.507
Mysterious ways, I tell you, mysterious ways.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.635
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans.. .

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.550
-Put it down!
-Drop the gun!

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.319
Put the goddamn gun down
right fucking now!

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.657
Easy, fellas. And I'm alone.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.362
-He's gone.
-Who the fuck are you?

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:17.633
My name is Eunice Bloom.
And I'm your new guardian angel.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:20.403
The torch was passed to me
by a mutual friend.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:23.512
A mutual friend?
By the name of fucking who?

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:28.215
<i>Paul Maximillian fucking Smecker.</i>

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:36.058
We heard. He was a good man.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:40.526
-Aye. You have our condolences.
-And you mine.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.428
Well, I'm glad everybody.. .
Who the fuck was that guy?

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:47.024
That, I suspect, was the shooter
you boys have been looking for.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:51.597
Who the fuck is this broad?
What the fuck is going on here?

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.437
Let's speed this up before your new
sidekick's gotta dig any deeper

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.204
into his impressive vocabulary.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:58.940
-Oh, no, you didn't!
-Oh, yes I did.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:03.018
I am an FBl agent
controlling this investigation from within

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:08.284
in order to ensure that you gentlemen
never see the inside of a prison cell.

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.223
Now, I am conspiring to do this
with three like-minded individuals

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.090
who have aided you in the past.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:17.290
Though I have yet to inform them
of my agenda because,

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:20.403
well, a girl's gotta have her fun.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.438
-Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?
-The very same.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.097
How are the lads doing?

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:29.075
Two of them are scared. One's just horny.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:32.979
-Bet you I can tell you which one.
-Bet you can't. Let's save it for group.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:36.108
-Right now we've got a big problem.
-What's that, then?

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.083
This simply won't do.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.579
Here's how it all went down.

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:13.687
<i>A secret gathering of the brugliones.
Topic of discussion.. .</i>

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:52.225
Yakavetta's lost control of the streets.
They're fighting over his throne.

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.887
This was not the work of the Saints.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.864
lnterpol came through.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:02.835
You were right. 5'5". Gotta be the shooter.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:08.036
That ain't all. Short stuff's work visa
was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist.

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:11.578
<i>Look at the date. Two months after 9/11 .</i>

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:15.180
What? I don't get it.

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:24.024
Someone maneuvered it through the system
using false information

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:26.391
during the highest alert in US history.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:30.556
Yakavetta's just a gangster.
He ain't got the juice to do that.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.031
You're darn tooting, he don't.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:37.937
lrregardless, lNS red-flagged it
like a motherfucker. It's a shit storm.

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:41.835
Something stinks
like a pig's ass in summertime.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.776
Come on. We've got someplace to be.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.882
It's, like, 2:00 am. There's nothing open now.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.444
It's after hours. I mean, if you want a drink.. .

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:54.284
Thirty-seven bodies later,
and we're finally back where it all began.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:56.051
You boys ever heard
of the Southern expression,

01:04:56.159 --> 01:05:01.187
"We have an elephant in the living room?"
Hope you fellows brought some peanuts.

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.433
What is this? What is this?

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.731
Who the fuck are you? You're either vice
or lAD. You're lAD, aren't you?

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:12.968
Okay, come on, fucking arrest us! Arrest us!
I'm ready! Come on out!

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.976
Hands above your head!

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.708
Stop it! God damn it!

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:24.576
You don't write! You don't fucking call!

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:28.623
-You should be ashamed of yourselves!
-Get the fuck out of here!

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.727
You knew all along?

01:05:31.828 --> 01:05:33.955
-Not keeping in touch with your old friends!
-Fucking bitch!

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.565
-Shame on you!
-You're beautiful, babe!

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.134
Thank you! Thank you!

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.836
-This is the fellow?
-That's the fellow.

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:45.236
He's a Sicilian immigrant,
name of Ottilio Panza.

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.506
He'll be front-page news in the morning,

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:50.943
but we have to assume that Yakavetta
already knows we've lD'd his guy.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.481
Can't give him time to plan-B us.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.983
We're hitting him in 48 hours.
That fast enough for you?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.817
-Should be. Where is it gonna happen?
-The Pru.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.152
The Prudential? What are you, cracked?

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:05.954
Why don't you just do it on center ice
at a fucking Bruins game?

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:09.088
That's where the man is,
so that's where we're going.

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:13.532
-No guts, no glory, green beans.
-ln fact, we could use a few extra hands.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.797
That is, if you boys
can still get your lrish on.

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:21.468
Hey, I got balls for days, pally.
I'm a fucking sack-o-matic.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.273
Yeah. He's a sack-o-matic.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.677
-We're in.
-We're in.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:30.650
All right, you boys have fun.
Connor, Murphy, escort a lady to the door.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:37.854
You sure you don't want to hear the plan?
I'm not one to sit here and brag, but.. .

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.554
-Jesus.
-.. .this one's really Picasso. Shut your hole.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.992
No, I want to critique your masterpiece
with fresh eyes.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.692
Besides, school night.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.962
-Got some homework to do.
-What's the matter?

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:51.905
Panza knew you guys were in there tonight
and he just let it happen.

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.475
I mean, if he's working for Yakavetta,

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:57.840
why would he just stand by
and watch all his men get taken out?

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:01.075
What, you think maybe we've got
another fox in the henhouse, then?

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:05.017
It's starting to look that way.
Somebody pushed that visa through.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:09.080
<i>We could have ourselves a genuine
Ghost and the Darkness here.</i>

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.394
They still live.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.067
What if he does not come? What if.. .

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.101
He will come.

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:41.351
Either that wily old man
is not as clever as we thought

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.859
or he played me from the git.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.001
You think he played me?

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:01.474
We got a mutiny on our hands.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:06.480
Every 10-cent wannabe with a gun
is moving on us all over town!

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:10.848
And our fearless leader
hasn't even come out of his pussy room yet!

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.949
<i>Capo fucking regime!</i>

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:21.127
I want each one of you
to call your top button man,

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.198
the best that you have.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:29.296
'Cause we are going to rip this city
a new asshole.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.471
Starting tonight,

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:37.540
we reconnoiter our strength on the streets.

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.314
Starting now,

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.050
we seize the day.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.212
<i>Law enforcement has classified
the ltalian immigrant Ottilio Panza</i>

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:52.020
<i>as its prime suspect
in the murder of the beloved local cleric.</i>

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:55.961
<i>An all-points bulletin has been issued,
and it appears, at least for the time being,</i>

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:59.466
<i>the Saints have been cleared
as suspects in the priest's killing.</i>

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:24.718
Foolish, arrogant boy!

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:35.399
Expanded my operations
since I saw you last.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:38.371
Word got out who may or may not
have outfitted you.

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:41.875
Turns out
you got quite the underground following.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.948
Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
select from my private reserve.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:51.212
If I may make a suggestion.

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:18.379
I feel like that kid who found
the golden ticket in that candy bar

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.915
<i>in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.</i>

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.375
-Charlie.
-Yeah, Charlie.

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:27.920
And I want an Oompa Loompa now,
Daddy, now.

01:10:35.498 --> 01:10:37.125
I'll take these.

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:43.595
-Have you been crying again?
-Yeah! Tears of joy.

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:46.438
Those are queer. How much?

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:49.443
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You boys are on the house.

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:52.571
-Obliged.
-Well, let's see.

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.656
-What?
-Nothing.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:05.522
-What, are you saying I look gay?
-No, you just hail from a colorful.. .

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:08.960
Hey, you don't know me.
Do these make me look gay?

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.768
You look like you might have seen one
up close.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:31.375
On a sultry Saturday in September,
the Saints saved 1 7 souls.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.491
Try saying that five times fast.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:43.528
Nothing to be afraid of. It's all over.

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:48.460
Fucking pussy. He won't come out.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.305
Special Agent Bloom!

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:55.366
You are hereby relieved of all obligation
to this investigation.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:12:02.246
And as of now, you will all report to me.
Special Agent John Kuntsler.

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.651
So, how you doing, Bloomy?

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:11.085
Just fine, Kunty.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:18.225
-You are suspended.
-Fine. But I'm gonna take a crack at it first.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:34.075
<i>They gained access somehow
through one of the service entrances.</i>

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.585
-What?
-Nothing.

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:15.987
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing!

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:20.323
This is just some heavy shit, that's all.
I'm just.. .

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.763
I'm just having a period of adjustment.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.834
You're about to have a period
of getting your ass beat!

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:28.994
This is you. Fucking be on time.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.281
You ready for this shit, my dear brother?

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:48.246
Let's do some gratuitous violence.

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.654
Meet! Front and center!

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.429
Make way.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:05.296
Each one of you

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:09.672
is to stick to the guy who called you
like stink on quim.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.543
Pick your own crews.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:16.815
You arm yourself to the teeth.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:21.949
And when these Bible-banging psychos
make their attempt,

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:27.017
it is your job to blow their soulless hearts
right out of their bodies.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.531
Okay, here's the situation, Lloyd.

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:43.702
Me and a couple of friends of mine
are fitting to do some killing here tonight.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.508
I'm talking bullets, blood,
custom wholesale slaughter.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:48.879
You follow me, Lloyd-o?

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:55.890
Good. Now, I've run into a little snag.
You see, I'm trying to figure out a tag line.

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:57.549
You know, something cool to say
when it's all over,

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:01.094
like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat."

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.825
Or, "I'll be back." But mine, you know?
I've gotta own this thing.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.662
It's creative!
It happened to be a creative plan!

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:12.400
Fucking ridiculous! Probably based
on some stupid shit you saw in a movie!

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:16.033
And here I am again,
all tying myself up with fucking rope!

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:17.874
What's the deal with you
and the fucking rope? Honestly!

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.881
It happened to be a very useful thing,
so shut it!

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.918
You didn't get this from a movie, did you?

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:27.750
<i>-The Eiger Sanction with Clint Eastwood.
-Fuck!</i>

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:31.587
-And it worked like a charm for him!
-I fucking knew!

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:36.090
Now I'm gonna take the gag off,
nice and slow so it doesn't hurt.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.127
I know, I know. I know, I know.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.568
This fucking hurts this way.

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.071
Fuck! Fuck.. .

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:49.937
Fuck!

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.377
-I know, I know, I know!
-I can't believe you, man! I'm a janitor.

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:54.312
What do I know about guns and bullets
and shit, man?

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:56.475
-Well, then, just.. .
-No! I don't care what you're doing here

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.382
with your fucking friends.
It's none of my business.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.115
-I'm just.. .
-I have a wife and a family and kids.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.624
Actually, they're not even my kids, right?
I'm taking care of some other asshole's kids

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.558
-on a fucking janitor's salary!
-I'm not riffing, Lloyd!

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:10.826
<i>Now, I need an hasta la vista line,
toute fucking suite</i>

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.593
and you're gonna help me think of one.

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.997
-What the fuck did you do?
-I don't know, it just stopped.

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:22.133
-Well, fucking get it going again!
-It won't turn back on! It just died!

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.906
-Shit!
-Fucking thing! Come on!

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.005
Come on! Come on, you piece of shit!

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:33.520
Starting tonight, each one of you limp-dick
fucking slobs is back out on the street

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:35.123
earning your daily bread.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:38.091
-Come on, come on! No!
-Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:43.997
-Okay, what about, "Take that, you suckers"?
-No, that's not cool enough, man.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:47.159
-How much time? How much fucking time?
-Sixty seconds!

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:49.032
-No, we gotta go right now! Right now!
-No fucking way!

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.160
What are you talking about?

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.035
If we're even a few seconds late,
Romeo's dead.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:57.202
You'd better all dust off your ball bats!
You'd better find your inner gangster!

01:16:57.513 --> 01:17:01.779
-"Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!"
-That's too sacrilegious.

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:05.676
-All right, we've got about 13 floors.
-Eleven more, ball park it!

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:08.483
It's about 15 per floor, we need.. . 165!

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.023
-Dude, wait!
-Count it up in fives!

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:13.322
-Five, 10, 15, 20.. .
-This is retarded!

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:16.193
<i>-Fucking Eiger Sanction!
-Shut it and concentrate! 25.. .</i>

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:19.733
'Cause you got to break bones!
You've got to crush skulls!

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:22.200
You gotta do what you gotta do!

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.039
You're gonna need those.

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.645
You shoot everybody in there,

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:36.184
and then you're like, "Yo, eat it! Eat it!"

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:40.051
-What, are we at a fucking buffet now?
-Fuck.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.917
You guys can't do this!
Are you fucking crazy?

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:46.152
-Time!
-Jesus Christ. Seven seconds!

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:47.694
-Holy shit!
-Six,

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.730
<i>-five, four...
-It's time.</i>

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:51.355
<i>...three, two...</i>

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.170
One thing has always amazed me.
How quiet it gets. You ever noticed that?

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.942
<i>It's hard to imagine
that just a few hours ago</i>

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:07.213
<i>it was the goddamn O.K . Corral in here.</i>

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:35.403
We're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned shoot-'em-up!

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:08.562
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.501
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:12.801
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:17.038
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.688
Who ordered the whup-ass fajitas?

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:32.157
-That's fucking stupid!
-It's completely retarded!

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:34.593
Was that the best you could do?

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.263
I just.. .

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.435
I couldn't.. .

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.237
Broke down the door, didn't you?

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:59.111
Ding-dong, motherfucker, ding-dong!

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:02.954
-Fucking A.
-You said it.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.130
And that, gentlemen,
is the sound of the fat lady singing.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:15.269
-Should we clap or something?
-Shut up.

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:18.396
-Hey, hey!
-Hey!

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.633
You hurt her, you piece of shit, I'll kill you!

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:23.938
She's not on there! There's nothing on there!

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.912
Get a hostage negotiator down here,
you fucking wad!

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.483
Get off me! What is your fucking problem?

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:32.985
He could be in there
all touching her and shit.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.487
Fuck! Come on!

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:41.455
Look, I was listening to you out there.
And that's, like, exactly what happened.

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:45.499
And that's what made me think
you were the person to talk to.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.267
So, Yakavetta had a partner?

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:59.345
Everybody gave Concezio props
for building the family back up.

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:04.145
"He's such a genius."
What bullshit. It was the Old Man all along.

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:07.278
-Old Man?
-Yeah, that's what he called him.

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:12.520
<i>For the last three years,
every play we made came straight from him.</i>

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.595
<i>Teaming up with the Chinese,</i>

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.790
<i>keeping the feud going between
Southie and the North End, everything.</i>

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:22.859
<i>Concezio worshipped the Old Man
like some kind of fucking Mafia oracle.</i>

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:26.634
I have no idea what his real name is, though.
Concezio always called him the Old Man.

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:32.476
Think. I mean, did he ever use a surname
or a nickname or something?

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:35.175
-One time.
-Well, what was it?

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:40.680
He called him the Roman.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.855
That's just weird. The Roman?

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.889
What do you think it means?

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:53.728
-Feels like our ghost to me.
-Well, what's the plan?

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:57.965
'Cause the brothers ain't going nowhere
until we get Panza or they do.

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:16.486
Sack-o-matic, I said!

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.757
-I've got nothing.
-One in the hole.

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:30.167
Fuck you! One, two, three!

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:35.232
-Boys! Boys!
-Put them down! Throw them over.

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:38.411
I'll kill the old man! Throw them over!

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:48.119
Brothers, huh?
We gonna have us some fun.

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:53.091
So, which one first?
Which one do you love more?

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:54.752
This one?

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.579
Doc! Call a fucking ambulance right now!

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.141
You.

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:20.551
Where's the Old Man?

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:22.650
Never.

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:40.797
-Just hold on, man.
-Help's on the way, hang in there!

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.777
Boys, it's over.

01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:51.842
It's okay. Proudest day of my life.

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.104
-Da!
-Easy, boys.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.779
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.650
I'm gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out right now!

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:29.451
Connor!

01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:33.494
Son, Daddy's working.

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:35.995
What the fuck you talking about?

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:43.127
Where is he?

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:47.231
No matter how this turns out,
you fucking die today!

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.400
Believe it, motherfucker.

01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:53.311
Where is the Old Man?

01:25:58.887 --> 01:25:59.911
No!

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.989
Make me famous.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.268
Where?

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.549
Where is he?

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:13.256
-You look good, Roc.
-You two don't.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.963
-Yeah, we had a friend.. .
-I know.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:21.264
He was a big boy.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.098
If it weren't for us,
maybe the two of you would.. .

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:26.173
Would what?
Would never have stood for anything?

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:27.673
What are you talking about, Roc?

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:31.768
I made my decision and stood next to you.
And it was an honor.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:37.141
And I wouldn't change that
for the whole world. Not one minute of it.

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.980
<i>Now, sláinte.</i>

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:52.955
You know, he was sort of a bad-ass, though,
wasn't he?

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.000
Shades of Eastwood.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:58.636
Charlie Bronson.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.833
Duke fucking Wayne!

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:03.274
-Duke fucking Wayne!
-Duke fucking Wayne!

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:06.609
Men build things. Then we die.

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:12.278
It's in our fucking DNA! That's what we do!

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:16.619
-And when it all falls down.. .
-We build it right back up again.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:21.025
-But this time bigger. Better!
-Look! Look what we can do.

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.858
Look how fucking beautiful we are.

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:26.467
You think the men that built all this
had it easy?

01:28:26.568 --> 01:28:28.661
-Hard men!
-Doing hard shit!

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:31.330
And that gives me a hard-on!

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.964
-But not in a gay way or anything.
-No, no, course not.

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.736
Yeah, goes without saying.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:40.746
I am so sick of this self-help, 1 2-step,

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:44.181
leftover hippie generation bullshit!

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:47.482
Now they don't want you to do anything,
right? Just sit there! Don't drink.. .

01:28:47.589 --> 01:28:49.921
Don't smoke! Don't drive fast!

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.889
Kiss my ass!

01:28:52.027 --> 01:28:54.518
Fuck it, do it all, I say!

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.358
You think Duke Wayne spent all his time

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:59.365
talking about his feelings
with a fucking therapist?

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:01.594
There's no fucking way he did!

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:07.038
John Wayne died with five pounds
of undigested red meat in his ass!

01:29:07.142 --> 01:29:11.374
Now that's a man!
Real men hide their feelings. Why?

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:14.744
Because it's none of your fucking business!

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:21.846
Men do not cry, men do not pout,
men jack you in the fucking jaw and say.. .

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:26.560
Thanks for coming out.

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:43.373
I am so sorry, boys. This was all my fault.

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.475
There's a few things
your dad needs to tell youse.

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:52.878
Come on, kid, it's good for you,
it's good for us.

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.319
We'll take you right out the back
of this place.

01:29:55.457 --> 01:29:58.119
-Easy, Noah.
-They'll never touch you.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.768
What, are you stupid or something?

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:35.291
<i>Noah, mio amico. No more of this!</i>

01:30:43.238 --> 01:30:44.705
I can't stop.

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:53.680
Okay, we think of something, eh?

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:55.675
We think of something.

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:59.176
Noah, look.

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.016
We got something for you.

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:07.820
My friend.. .

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:38.858
<i>Bonnavese is always with two men.
Both of them, La Cosa Nostra, many years.</i>

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:23.263
<i>That's how it went for years.</i>

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:29.574
Louie would do all the planning
and I would do the other.

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:31.403
Jesus.

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:32.843
How'd you end up inside, Da?

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:38.118
Back in '75 I did a piece of work.

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:42.680
I come out
and the police was waiting for me.

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.984
He set me up. Twenty-five to life.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:53.765
-Why did he set you up?
-I can't wait to ask him.

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:57.269
Why didn't you flip on him, Da?
The guy fucked you.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.370
<i>He had learned of the birth of my sons.</i>

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:24.126
Hello, my old friend.

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.962
Many years.

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:31.395
Are you in need?

01:33:31.673 --> 01:33:34.301
I am making marinara and alas.. .

01:33:34.509 --> 01:33:36.909
...I have run out of tomatoes.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.307
To help an old friend.. .

01:33:40.682 --> 01:33:42.172
...how many can you spare?

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.147
Don't worry.

01:33:46.054 --> 01:33:48.887
You are in luck.

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:53.085
I am in good supply of tomatoes.

01:33:58.533 --> 01:34:01.502
Agent Kuntsler, you gotta see this.
We just found.. .

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:06.905
It's Bloom. She just back-doored this info
from Fed archives.

01:34:09.544 --> 01:34:11.171
Jesus Christ, she's gone rogue!

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:12.337
-Get an APB on her!
-John!

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:15.348
-I want that crazy bitch grabbed up now!
-John, think about this!

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:16.747
Jimmy!

01:34:17.552 --> 01:34:19.019
What the fuck are you doing?

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.521
Who the fuck is this?

01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:30.963
He's in York, Maine. About an hour
from here. But he's off the grid.

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:34.290
<i>Logged on to an FBl database
to get the info.</i>

01:34:34.469 --> 01:34:37.404
<i>Only a matter of time before they flag it.</i>

01:34:37.739 --> 01:34:40.799
Better get a move on
or they'll get there before you do.

01:34:40.942 --> 01:34:42.933
Will they know it's you?

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.645
Yeah.

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.810
Will you be all right, dear?

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.648
I hear Costa Rica's nice.

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:07.128
I never thought I'd ask this of another
human being, but please, kill this man.

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.629
<i>Kill this man.</i>

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:41.755
Hello, Louie.

01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:44.250
Noah.

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:47.057
We haven't much time.

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.628
My garden is.. .

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.801
She's beautiful, no?

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:05.311
But I forget, your eyes are blind to beauty.

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.610
You are.. .

01:38:10.151 --> 01:38:12.483
You are a destroyer, Noah.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.686
You know my reasons.

01:38:17.959 --> 01:38:19.927
But do you?

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:24.327
You think it's.. .
You think it's for your father.

01:38:26.167 --> 01:38:31.332
No. You were born a killer.

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:36.966
<i>Death, la morte, it is in the blood.</i>

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:41.607
-No.
-No.

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:48.947
This is bullshit. We should go now.

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:52.150
It's only one fucking guy.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:57.720
Explain these.

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:12.734
You were not there to raise them.

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:16.406
Not one single day.

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:22.378
But how closely
they followed their father's footsteps.

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:28.488
<i>They got your blood, Noah, tua rabbia.</i>

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:30.590
Your anger.

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:02.591
And you? What are you?

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:07.064
I am a creator.

01:40:08.436 --> 01:40:09.733
You see,

01:40:11.639 --> 01:40:13.368
we were opposed.

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:20.410
<i>As old as la storia di frog and.. .</i>

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.415
Scorpion.

01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:29.116
Scorpion.

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:34.760
Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.328
Copy that. Waiting for the signal.

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:43.596
What the fuck is this place?
It gives me the creeps.

01:40:44.839 --> 01:40:47.171
Why did you sell me out, Louie?

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:50.268
You can never understand.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:55.842
Twenty-five years.

01:40:58.385 --> 01:41:02.344
-Try me.
-They were building something.

01:41:02.857 --> 01:41:08.318
-They?
-They were creating something. An empire.

01:41:08.462 --> 01:41:11.488
-They?
-I was helping them!

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.461
I used you, Noah,

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:20.602
<i>to destroy their competition,
to cut out their cancers.</i>

01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:26.205
I earned my place among them.

01:41:30.351 --> 01:41:34.788
Is this your place amongst them?
Because all I see

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:38.887
is an old man in a broke-down palace,

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.022
sitting in a garden.

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:48.497
The scorpion and the frog

01:41:49.904 --> 01:41:51.963
both lose everything.

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:59.745
See, without you,
I was no longer useful to them.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.346
They cast me out!

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:10.648
My old man used to tell me
about a place like this.

01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:12.919
Back in the woods,
he said that there's this guy.. .

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:16.062
Why the priest, Louie?

01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:20.497
Why all this? Why now?

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:26.171
Because I knew it would bring you
and your sons.

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:32.175
You will destroy the Yakavettas for me.
Clear my way.

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:39.348
And this time, I will take what is mine. Just.. .

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:44.382
<i>Just a little piccolo pezzo.</i>

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.258
For my old age.

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:56.530
After all, I have never been a greedy man.

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:26.510
<i>Beyond the River, done by
Anthony and Harrison, Edison Records.</i>

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.019
Connor!

01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:32.285
Murph!

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:38.193
Take me to him! Take me to him now!

01:45:54.982 --> 01:45:58.145
I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:12.126
No, Da! No, please!

01:46:13.267 --> 01:46:14.495
God, no!

01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:18.602
Look! Look, boys.

01:46:24.812 --> 01:46:26.507
It's so beautiful.

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:31.280
-It's a beautiful day.
-No.

01:46:35.289 --> 01:46:37.985
It is, Da. It is.

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.627
It is beautiful, Da.

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:53.966
Aye, it is, Da.

01:47:50.264 --> 01:47:52.732
<i>And they that holdest my name</i>

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:58.769
<i>shall come with the shaking of the earth</i>

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.505
<i>and the roiling of the oceans.</i>

01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:28.394
It's a non-extradition country.
Passport under your name.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:31.938
Money, contacts
and a map to your final destination.

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:34.903
-Which is?
-The monastery at Saint Escazú.

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:36.703
A monastery?

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:39.040
Monasteries enjoy the protection
of the Holy See.

01:48:39.146 --> 01:48:43.583
They're not even subject to local laws,
searches, et cetera.

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:45.982
A sanctuary within a sanctuary.

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:49.088
He's going to take you by boat
to a private airstrip down the shore,

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:53.558
where we have arranged for your travel.
Off the books, of course.

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:56.421
Father, I ain't one to look a gift horse,

01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:59.328
but you still haven't told me
how you're involved in all this.

01:48:59.466 --> 01:49:00.728
And second, I need to disappear,

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:04.270
you show up with plans and paperwork
in hand.

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:06.771
It's like you knew before I did.

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:11.104
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
my dear.

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:14.910
We wanted you to know
that you're not alone.

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:20.453
-We have many resources.
-You keep saying "we." Now, who's "we"?

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.017
You ready to go?

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.131
I hear they party pretty hard
at that monastery.

01:49:57.391 --> 01:50:01.691
I'm not sure I'm in love
with that new look there, Betty Boop.

01:50:03.397 --> 01:50:09.233
-I attended your funeral, you son of a bitch!
-I know. Loved your shoes.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:13.402
The skirt was a little risqué for a funeral,
but, hey,

01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:19.539
who am I to begrudge someone
their sense of individuality?

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:21.875
-What is this?
-Keep it down.

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:26.009
You don't wanna scare away
my little fishies.

01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:32.017
Fuck your fish!
What the hell is going on here?

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:34.423
You are exposed, young lady!

01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:40.325
You're a very clever little girl, Eunice.
That's why I chose you.

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:46.163
Now it's time for you
to put your thinking cap on.

01:50:49.076 --> 01:50:51.442
We got all the financial backing
and protection

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:54.046
of the biggest corporation in the world.

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:58.106
And two CEOs worthy of the public trust.

01:51:00.087 --> 01:51:03.523
Now, what do you think is going on here?

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:07.689
You wanna get them out.

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:09.591
I want to get them out,
get them back to work,

01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:12.460
take this thing to a whole new level.

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.896
Where're they being held?

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:23.369
Set them free! Set them free!
Set them free! Set them free!

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:38.318
