<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:02.602 --> 00:05.537
This symbol was on
some sort of security key card

00:05.605 --> 00:07.630
we found near the remains
in the woods.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.471
The victim or the killer
may have dropped it.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.704
Do you think you've
ever seen it before?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.342
No.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.474
Kyle,
you know this is just a game.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.485
If anyone can get a Ouija board
to work, it's him.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.919
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.619
What does it mean?

00:27.961 --> 00:30.259
Kyle, this is Charlie, my boyfriend.

00:32.131 --> 00:35.465
Come on, Hils. Truce?
I'm so over fighting.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.368
For reals?
Because I'm so over you.

00:39.906 --> 00:43.535
Fractured pieces of his past
are entering his consciousness.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.809
I think it's a memory.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.974
- You recognize him?
- No, I've never seen him before.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.779
He's starting to remember.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.446
Kyle, what's wrong?

00:58.658 --> 00:59.989
That's him.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.762
<i>He was all I could think about.</i>

01:16.676 --> 01:20.134
<i>I couldn't understand why or how
he'd been in my dream.</i>

01:23.550 --> 01:26.110
<i>Or how I could draw his face
if I didn't know him?</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.723
<i>Was he dead?</i>

01:30.824 --> 01:34.487
<i>Or was the professor
still missing... like me?</i>

01:34.561 --> 01:37.826
Kyle? Hey.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.561
We talked about this.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.866
It's not good for you to keep obsessing.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.839
Have you heard from Detective Breen?

01:47.907 --> 01:51.274
The police still don't know if those
remains were Professor Kern's.

01:51.377 --> 01:54.540
The more you think about this
the more it'll agitate you.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.641
So let's just wait for the test results,
and we'll deal with it then.

01:59.986 --> 02:02.250
Josh is outside
with some of his buddies.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.780
Why don't you go take a few shots?
Show 'em how it's done.

02:26.679 --> 02:30.137
<i>Nicole was right. Basketball
was a welcome distraction.</i>

02:30.216 --> 02:32.548
<i>It took me out of my head
and into a zone</i>

02:32.619 --> 02:35.588
<i>where nothing mattered
but the ball and the hoop.</i>

02:39.225 --> 02:41.750
- That's ten for ten.
- The guy doesn't miss.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.160
- Yeah, at free throws, maybe.
- Yeah?

02:44.230 --> 02:47.324
Kyle, back up.
Make some three-pointers.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.367
Come on.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.906
Oh, my God!

03:04.684 --> 03:05.981
Sweet shot.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.114
That's nothing. He nails it every time.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.647
- Oh, yeah?
- Show him, Kyle. Spice it up a little.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.025
<i>I tried to calculate all the data,</i>

03:18.131 --> 03:21.658
<i>but one variable was hard to determine.</i>

03:21.734 --> 03:23.258
<i>Then I found a solution.</i>

03:31.811 --> 03:34.371
Oh! That was insane!
How'd you do that?

03:34.480 --> 03:37.643
Angle, trajectory, velocity, wind.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.685
And all this time I've been
chucking a ball through a hoop.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.584
You ever think about joining a team?

03:42.655 --> 03:44.623
- There you are.
- Hey, you.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.783
- How you doing, Kyle?
- Good.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.827
- We got a sweet shooter here.
- We do?

03:48.928 --> 03:50.361
Oh, yeah. Seriously, Kyle,

03:50.430 --> 03:52.990
come by the rec center tomorrow,
try out for the team.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.227
This late? You're already in the finals.

03:55.335 --> 03:58.771
Kyle hitting these three-pointers
could make all the difference.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.366
I'll talk to coach about you.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.138
Well, if anyone can
make it happen, it's Charlie.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.577
- OK, I'll try.
- Cool.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.547
I'll see you then.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.444
Bye, Kyle.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.647
Kyle, light it up!

04:17.824 --> 04:20.588
Man, there's no way
he can do it again.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.727
Kyle, shoot!

04:58.197 --> 05:00.757
What?

05:00.867 --> 05:03.427
You got to look cool
playing ball, Kyle.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.597
I don't?

05:07.106 --> 05:09.768
How do I put this? No.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.211
Let me show you.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.213
See?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.283
Now you're a real baller.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.454
But you can't just look the part,
you got to talk the talk.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.498
- Speak the lingo.
- Lingo?

05:32.565 --> 05:34.226
Yeah, the slang, dude.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.461
Like when you dunk,
you got to scream,

05:36.536 --> 05:40.165
"Booya! That's the kizzle dizzle!"

05:40.239 --> 05:42.901
- What's the kizzle dizzle?
- You are.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.671
Trust me, Kyle.
I know what I'm talking about.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.526
Wow, Kyle, you look like a pro.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.294
- Ready for action?
- I think so.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.668
I remember when I played.
Out on the court, get that rhythm going,

06:12.739 --> 06:15.299
the whole team moving
like they share one brain.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.809
Five jocks equals one brain.
That sounds right.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.311
Anyway, I remember one game,
down by one,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.816
five seconds left, I steal the ball,
dribble down the court and...

06:23.883 --> 06:26.443
Swish! Hit the game-winning shot
at the buzzer.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.682
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks, Josh. Spoil it for Kyle?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.155
I'm sure you'll tell it
a hundred more times.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.624
Lori, could you drop Kyle off today?

06:34.727 --> 06:38.254
- What am I, your chauffeur now?
- I'm late for a consultation, OK?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.959
- Enjoy your morning.
- Thank you. Don't be long.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.798
Bye, guys.
Kyle, good luck today, OK?

06:44.871 --> 06:47.897
And remember, as long as you
give it your best, you can't lose.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.408
Words to live by, by Nicole Trager.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.841
Bye.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.285
Here you go.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.287
You're welcome.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.591
<i>They tossed the ball in a
symphony of lines, curves and angles.</i>

07:21.874 --> 07:23.307
Kyle, what's up, dawg?

07:25.378 --> 07:28.108
That means, "Hey, how are you?"

07:28.848 --> 07:31.476
- Oh.
- So you made it.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.111
- Can I play?
- First, just...

07:34.220 --> 07:38.281
First, lose this. Better.
Come on. I'll show you around.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.520
Trager!

07:46.899 --> 07:48.127
Hey.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.931
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, what are you?

07:51.003 --> 07:54.837
- Brought Kyle to practice.
- Kyle? What for?

07:54.907 --> 07:56.465
Charlie wants him on the team.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.678
What the hell is he thinking?

08:03.082 --> 08:06.017
So are we doing the ignoring thing now

08:06.085 --> 08:08.815
or just shooting nasty looks?
I just want to be clear.

08:08.888 --> 08:12.119
Don't flatter yourself. I don't waste
my time worrying about you.

08:12.191 --> 08:14.216
You don't waste any time at all,
do you?

08:14.961 --> 08:18.692
You and Declan crashed and burned.
He's fair game.

08:18.764 --> 08:22.530
Oh, yeah. I'm so sure you're
concerned with the fairness of it all.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.627
I see what I want and I go get it.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.831
I don't hold out my whole life

08:26.906 --> 08:29.238
and then finally go through with it

08:29.308 --> 08:31.833
and completely mess it up.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.893
- Dude, we can't add Kyle now.
- Why not?

08:55.001 --> 08:58.869
For one thing, the guy doesn't know
his ass from his forehead.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.872
Well, have you ever seen him shoot?

09:08.281 --> 09:12.615
Tanner, we can't pick up a new player
a week before the finals.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.050
That's what I said.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.213
Coach, the guy hits
nothing but net every time.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.417
The team is perfectly balanced.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.858
We're up against the Lancers.

09:21.961 --> 09:26.091
I can't have some unknown
coming in to disrupt everything.

09:26.165 --> 09:29.225
- At least watch him shoot.
- Why are you pushing this?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.203
I want to win. Are you afraid
he'll steal your thunder?

09:32.271 --> 09:34.364
- Me and him, one-on-one.
- Enough.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.568
It's too late to change the roster.

09:37.643 --> 09:41.306
But Kyle's new in town. I bet
the league will make an exception.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.911
Where did you say
this kid comes from, Tanner?

10:17.984 --> 10:19.679
Does it matter?

10:21.287 --> 10:25.018
- Kyle's on the team?
- And he practically made every shot.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.150
That's fantastic.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.888
Kyle, this could be such
a great experience for you.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.829
- When's the game?
- Next Sunday. It's the championship.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.458
You're playing in the final?
Against who?

10:35.534 --> 10:38.059
- I don't know.
- The Lancers.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.367
Apparently, they've won
the past two years.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.997
Kyle's team is gunning for them.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.542
- It's testosterone overload.
- It's just a game.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.874
It is not just a game,
it's a championship,

10:46.946 --> 10:48.971
and Kyle is their secret weapon.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.382
- Weapon?
- Kyle, it is just a game.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.287
Absolutely. It's just all about fun.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.324
I know, I know.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.667
He's on the team one day and I turn into
one of those obnoxious fathers.

11:13.472 --> 11:14.734
Thanks.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.139
I just don't want to put
any pressure on him.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.769
He needs to ease into
new social situations.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.370
I'll root him on quietly.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.374
I've been reading about Professor Kern.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.679
Hon, we still don't know
if there's a connection.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.019
- I know.
- Did you find anything?

11:32.091 --> 11:36.187
Most of his research is about the brain,
maximizing its potential.

11:36.262 --> 11:40.164
- I know what you're thinking.
- We've seen what Kyle can do.

11:40.232 --> 11:45.192
Maybe Professor Kern was his teacher,
and if Kyle witnessed his murder...

11:45.304 --> 11:48.865
Hon, you're drawing conclusions
before there's any real evidence.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.535
Kyle drew that picture of Kern
before he knew Kern was missing.

11:52.645 --> 11:56.103
And if that skeleton found in
the woods turns out to be Kern's,

11:56.182 --> 11:58.742
you can't tell me
that's just a coincidence.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.621
<i>Kyle's around 16. Why would
a college professor be teaching him?</i>

12:10.696 --> 12:13.164
<i>He knew Kyle was gifted.</i>

12:13.232 --> 12:15.860
<i>- This is Foss.
- Kern was in the news again.</i>

12:15.935 --> 12:18.597
<i>The police are going to
start making connections.</i>

12:19.205 --> 12:20.866
I told you they won't.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.738
I got a plan.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.578
<i>- What kind of theories?
- There's not much detail here.</i>

12:39.225 --> 12:41.557
<i>I enjoyed the simple logic
of the game,</i>

12:41.627 --> 12:44.687
<i>but having someone try to prevent me
from making a basket</i>

12:44.764 --> 12:46.493
<i>was a totally new experience.</i>

12:51.637 --> 12:55.164
- Hey! You totally hacked him.
- What're you, his personal ref?

12:55.241 --> 12:57.937
- He's still learning the game.
- He only has a week.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.773
He needs a crash course.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.506
You OK?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.777
I don't think Declan
wants me on the team.

13:05.885 --> 13:09.821
No, he gets a little intense.
Hang in there, you're doing good.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.028
Now that Kyle's on the team,

13:19.131 --> 13:21.656
the Bison are gonna wipe the floor
with the Lancers.

13:21.734 --> 13:25.101
I don't know, dude. It's one thing
to score in your backyard,

13:25.204 --> 13:27.536
but the Lancers got killer defense.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.767
Well, I'm a believer.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.174
Dude, trust me,
they'll double-team him.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.007
That won't stop Kyle.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.848
Got five? Got five.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.041
Want to bet?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.920
Sure, put me in for five.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.649
Dude, put me down for a Hamilton.

13:51.697 --> 13:52.664
Cool.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.326
Here's everything you need
to know about the game.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.860
<i>Pulls it up in the front court,
finds O'Brien around the corner.</i>

14:01.106 --> 14:03.870
Three hundred pages
should take you five minutes.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.035
Who's Michael Jordan?

14:06.111 --> 14:09.478
Yeah, you're not
from a different planet.

14:09.582 --> 14:13.040
He's only the greatest
basketball player ever.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.449
<i>Ever?</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:18.980
Look, if you're gonna play,
you gotta learn from the best.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.720
Read these.
They'll make you unbeatable.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.356
- Josh, get the door!
- I'm not your butler!

14:27.433 --> 14:29.492
Just answer it, you little creep!

14:38.210 --> 14:41.338
Whoa. I didn't know Lori
could handle two at once.

14:41.413 --> 14:45.179
Very funny. Now get out of my way.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.985
Is Kyle here?

14:49.455 --> 14:50.786
- In here.
- OK.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.620
So now that Kyle's on your team,

14:53.692 --> 14:56.252
what do you make of your chances?

14:56.962 --> 14:59.931
- The Lancers are going down.
- I guarantee it.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.391
That's all I wanted to hear.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.543
<i>Because he's
really bringing the heat.</i>

15:15.614 --> 15:17.878
<i>- Jackson brings the ball...
- Hey, Kyle.</i>

15:18.484 --> 15:19.849
What's up, dawg?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.588
Coach told me to drop off
the playbook and...

15:27.559 --> 15:31.518
About practice today...
I should've gone easier on you.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.791
That's OK. You blocked my shot.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.233
I should've pump-faked to make you
leave your feet and draw the foul.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.375
This final, dude, it's vital.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.547
We lost to the Lancers last year
in overtime on a heartbreaker.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.591
A buzzer-beater won the championship.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.922
Hey, I didn't know
you guys were here.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.258
- Hey, Lori.
- What's going on, Trager?

16:06.332 --> 16:10.234
- Well, I don't want to interrupt.
- No, no, no. I'm done here.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.270
Come chat with me.

16:15.908 --> 16:16.875
Wow.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.272
You must really love the game.

16:20.579 --> 16:21.910
More all the time.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.439
Man. You know there's nothing
like being on a team.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.281
You know, knowing my boys
got my back and I got theirs.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.017
That sounds cool.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.959
The judge slammed me with
50 hours of community service.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.289
That's so harsh.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.853
Said I could've gotten worse
for hit-and-run.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.900
- Did your dad totally freak?
- It wasn't pretty.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.904
So you coming to the game?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.371
You're looking at your cheering section.

16:48.474 --> 16:52.342
- Really?
- Yeah, I love to watch you play.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.879
Hang on a sec.

17:01.787 --> 17:06.156
- Oh, it's you.
- I live here. What do you want?

17:06.258 --> 17:08.818
- Declan.
- Excuse me?

17:08.926 --> 17:12.294
- Hey, Hils.
- Hey! I saw your car.

17:12.364 --> 17:16.824
- So you're stalking him now?
- No, that's your MO.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.565
I just figured I'd pop in
and save us some time.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.003
Ready to go?

17:23.608 --> 17:24.701
You had plans?

17:24.777 --> 17:27.143
Uh... Did we?

17:27.246 --> 17:30.010
Well, when I saw you today,
you said, "See you later. "

17:30.115 --> 17:32.379
Here it is. Later.

17:32.451 --> 17:35.716
That is so lame.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.224
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
Just get over it already.

17:39.291 --> 17:44.024
- Over what?
- Yeah. It's all good.

17:45.664 --> 17:46.995
So it's up to you.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.298
A night out with me
or slum it here with Trager.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.098
- Ready to bounce, D?
- Absolutely.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.172
- Check you later, bro.
- Later, bro.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.310
Hey, Kyle.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.951
Oh, that felt good!

19:21.293 --> 19:23.557
<i>I thought about
what Charlie said.</i>

19:23.629 --> 19:25.995
<i>I wanted to prove I was one of the guys.</i>

19:26.665 --> 19:28.963
<i>In all the books Josh gave me,</i>

19:29.034 --> 19:31.366
<i>one move was respected
more than any other.</i>

19:31.436 --> 19:34.200
<i>They called it... the Air Jordan.</i>

19:47.386 --> 19:50.048
Booya! That's the kizzle dizzle!

19:50.656 --> 19:53.124
Did you see that? He's awesome.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.955
Yeah, yeah, that was pretty cool.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.496
Hey, yo. Check this out.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.782
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. It's no big deal.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.357
He hurt the same ankle a few weeks ago.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.655
We need you a hundred percent
for the game.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.561
- Sit out the rest of practice.
- You know coach. I'd lose my spot.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.326
Why would you lose your spot?

20:35.601 --> 20:37.569
Let's go, ladies. Line up.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.867
Ladies?

20:46.845 --> 20:51.873
- McDonough... what's up?
- Nothing.

20:51.950 --> 20:55.215
Good. No room for soft players here.

20:57.055 --> 21:00.616
Kyle, are you waiting
for a special invitation?

21:00.692 --> 21:02.250
Move it!

21:02.361 --> 21:05.421
Rush down on three,
come back two on one.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.987
Let's go! Move it!

21:09.501 --> 21:10.593
Move it!

21:13.472 --> 21:16.737
So I've got you down for 25
and you for 30.

21:16.808 --> 21:20.574
- Sure you can cover these bets?
- Dude, I've got deep pockets.

21:20.679 --> 21:24.206
You must be smoking something.
Lancers haven't lost in two years.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.548
- They won't start with the Bison.
- Guess I'm feeling lucky.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.952
Pleasure doing business with you.
You want in?

21:35.661 --> 21:37.925
So you ready for the NBA?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.662
- I don't think I'm tall enough.
- It was a joke.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.798
God, could she be
any more transparent?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.110
You don't like her talking to him?

21:52.210 --> 21:54.940
Well, she's just flirting with him
to annoy me.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.914
It's working.

22:00.719 --> 22:04.086
Oh, so now you're an expert
on teenage girl warfare?

22:04.189 --> 22:07.681
You're at war with her? Over what?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.258
Because she...

22:11.330 --> 22:16.165
I... What difference does it make?
She's a total bitch and we're fighting.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.303
Wait here, LeBron.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.040
- OK, I'll show it to you.
- OK.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.372
For sure.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.004
Hey, Trager.
Picking up Boy Wonder?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.910
Yeah, it's such a pain, but...
at least I get to see you.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.351
Gag me.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.117
So I was thinking we could
hang out this weekend.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.954
Sure. A bunch of us are going to...

22:41.026 --> 22:43.654
No, no. Just us.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.687
Just us?

22:45.764 --> 22:48.130
We have been known
to hook up every now and then.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.394
I thought it was only "then. "

22:50.469 --> 22:53.097
Yeah, and "then" was a total disaster.

22:54.239 --> 22:56.264
It's a new day. Let's see where it goes.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.419
Nice shot.

23:19.998 --> 23:22.432
Nice work.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.733
Come on, sit. Come on.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.573
Hey, buddy.

23:39.618 --> 23:40.915
Want to make some money?

23:41.486 --> 23:47.356
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.485
Get in, I'll explain it to you.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.522
Come on!

23:53.365 --> 23:55.026
Thattaboy.

24:12.884 --> 24:15.648
- Hey, what's going on?
- You're not gonna believe this.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.985
- Adults only.
- What? The kids aren't home?

24:19.057 --> 24:20.786
Let's enjoy it while we can.

24:21.793 --> 24:25.058
Well, one of us
really should start dinner.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.859
Nah. Let's order in.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.534
I like the way you think.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.728
<i>In an exclusive story,
police have identified the remains</i>

24:32.804 --> 24:35.329
<i>found by hikers
near Victor Falls last month</i>

24:35.407 --> 24:38.570
<i>as William Kern,
a professor of biochemistry</i>

24:38.677 --> 24:40.804
<i>at the University of Washington.</i>

24:40.879 --> 24:44.337
<i>Dr. Kern was last seen
leaving campus in June.</i>

24:44.416 --> 24:47.442
<i>Police believe
he was killed soon after,</i>

24:47.519 --> 24:50.750
<i>but so far, no arrests
have been made in the murder.</i>

24:50.822 --> 24:54.155
<i>And coming up next,
all your local weather and...</i>

25:00.098 --> 25:02.032
Yes, I'm still holding.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.961
Well, I've called three times.
Has he gotten my messages?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.767
Well, tell the detective
I'm expecting his call.

25:11.776 --> 25:14.711
He would've called if he had
something new to tell us.

25:14.779 --> 25:16.406
Yes, those are Kern's remains.

25:16.481 --> 25:19.006
The police haven't found
anything to link to Kyle.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.814
He saw Kern in his dream.

25:21.887 --> 25:25.015
He was able to draw his face.
He must've known him. He had to.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.520
Maybe we should tell him
what's going on.

25:30.395 --> 25:33.159
Not yet. He's so excited
about basketball.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.199
Let's wait and tell him tomorrow.

25:43.008 --> 25:45.272
- More?
- You got to keep your energy up.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.811
Remember, every shot counts today.

25:48.146 --> 25:50.376
I've got a lot riding on this game.

25:50.448 --> 25:53.008
- You do?
- Well, yeah,

25:53.118 --> 25:55.985
I've been chatting up
how great a player Kyle is.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.784
- Don't let me down.
- Josh, you'll make him nervous.

25:58.857 --> 26:02.384
It's OK if you are, Kyle. It just means
your adrenaline is pumping.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.985
My stomach does feel strange.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.726
You've got butterflies.
It's an expression.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.234
Wait till you make
that first basket.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.863
You're going to feel
an incredible jolt of energy.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.338
- Oh.
- Are you both coming to the game?

26:16.408 --> 26:19.377
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Can't wait.

26:21.279 --> 26:24.442
Ladies and gentlemen.
Can I have your attention, please?

26:24.549 --> 26:26.517
Welcome to our championship game!

26:26.618 --> 26:28.779
- This is it.
- Would you give it up, please,

26:28.853 --> 26:31.822
for last year's champions, the Lancers!

26:33.992 --> 26:38.861
And this year's champs
in the west side division, the Bison!

26:44.703 --> 26:46.671
Way to go, Kyle!

26:47.172 --> 26:49.902
Dude, could your dad
be any more into it?

26:51.309 --> 26:54.039
- Woo-hoo!
- Let's meet the starting lineup.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.240
First, for the defending
champions the Lancers...

26:58.216 --> 27:01.549
Point guard number eleven,
Noel Beck.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.551
- Hey. Can I sit here?
- Sure.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.853
All right.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.327
It all comes down to this.

27:14.399 --> 27:18.733
One game, one moment in time
to prove that we are the best.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.964
And we are the best!

27:21.039 --> 27:24.167
We haven't beaten the Lancers
in two years.

27:24.242 --> 27:25.800
Two years!

27:25.877 --> 27:30.507
<i>I had no idea why coach was shouting
or why he kept saying things twice.</i>

27:30.582 --> 27:33.915
My grandma plays
better defense than them.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.886
<i>- My grandma!
- Too bad she's not playing.</i>

27:38.223 --> 27:41.488
Make sure to set screens for Kyle.

27:41.559 --> 27:44.050
Free him up to shoot.
He's our star.

27:45.597 --> 27:49.863
And help him out on defense.
He's still adjusting to our system.

27:49.934 --> 27:52.596
- We got your back, Kyle.
- OK, "team" on three.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.196
- One, two, three.
- Team!

27:55.273 --> 27:56.797
Trager, feeling the heat.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.309
Hey, so how much are you going
to end up owing?

27:59.377 --> 28:01.038
- Yeah.
- Yo, I'm cashing in.

28:01.112 --> 28:04.013
And don't come crying to me
when I upgrade my game system.

28:08.820 --> 28:12.779
- What's that for?
- Oh, I keep Charlie's stats for him.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.385
Do you want a page to keep track
of Declan and Kyle?

28:16.494 --> 28:19.019
Are you kidding me?
I hate watching basketball.

28:19.097 --> 28:21.065
Then why are you here?

28:44.556 --> 28:45.614
Yeah!

28:47.659 --> 28:50.389
<i>An explosion of positive energy
filled the gym.</i>

28:50.462 --> 28:53.090
<i>I felt a wave of excitement
from the crowd</i>

28:53.164 --> 28:55.894
<i>and the thrilled support of my team.</i>

28:55.967 --> 28:58.936
<i>Playing basketball was
everything I'd hoped it would be.</i>

29:11.549 --> 29:13.278
Yo! Here we go!

29:14.586 --> 29:15.712
Let's go, Declan!

29:44.549 --> 29:46.312
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

29:56.728 --> 30:00.494
<i>In the final minutes of the game
the competition became more intense.</i>

30:02.400 --> 30:03.765
Kyle, what are you doing?

30:15.146 --> 30:17.171
Come on, man! Get the foul!

30:27.592 --> 30:29.253
Come on, man. Make the pass.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.852
<i>My own teammates
grew hostile and impatient.</i>

30:31.930 --> 30:34.899
<i>- Get your head in the game.
- My own coach seemed against me.</i>

30:34.966 --> 30:38.129
Kyle, control the ball,
you control the game.

30:38.203 --> 30:39.170
The game!

30:45.844 --> 30:48.005
That's my rock! Don't forget it!

30:48.780 --> 30:51.305
Damn it, Kyle, guard the man!

30:52.717 --> 30:54.275
That's your man!

30:55.386 --> 30:59.117
<i>I was trying my best, but even
Stephen seemed disappointed in me.</i>

31:00.091 --> 31:03.356
<i>Everything I'd loved
about the sport began to disappear.</i>

31:09.767 --> 31:10.734
My ankle.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.540
- You OK, man?
- Timeout!

31:29.220 --> 31:31.950
Shake it off, McDonough.
It's crunch time.

31:33.958 --> 31:38.327
- Damn it!
- McDonough, we need you.

31:38.429 --> 31:40.158
Come on.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.335
- I can't, coach.
- Can't?

31:46.070 --> 31:49.039
Get your ass on that court
or you're out.

31:49.140 --> 31:52.109
<i>I couldn't believe
that the coach wanted him to play.</i>

31:52.176 --> 31:54.337
<i>It was like winning clouded everything.</i>

31:54.445 --> 31:57.710
Play or you're off the team for good.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.342
- Coach, you can't do that.
- Shut up, Tanner!

32:00.451 --> 32:02.919
We can't win if we play with quitters.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.325
Kyle, take his spot.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.827
You deaf?

32:14.699 --> 32:16.064
Forget McDonough.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.494
You're the shooting guard now.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.574
No.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.040
What did you say?

32:27.345 --> 32:30.508
- I said no.
- This is your team now.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.245
Your chance to shine.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.254
I can't play, coach.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.828
I'm injured too.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.594
Then you're off the team
with McDonough.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.528
Tanner, take over.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.269
Sorry. My ankle's hurt too.

32:58.042 --> 33:02.103
- Who's going in?
- Can't, coach. I'm hurt.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.379
Me too.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.909
This can't be happening.

33:12.190 --> 33:15.023
- What's Kyle doing? Why won't he play?
- I don't know.

33:15.093 --> 33:18.995
Coach, I need your team
on the floor or you forfeit.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.628
All of you...

33:22.734 --> 33:24.793
...out on that court now!

33:28.206 --> 33:29.764
Do this.

33:30.708 --> 33:35.475
Do this and you'll regret it
for the rest of your lives!

33:43.554 --> 33:45.613
Bison forfeit. Lancers win.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.521
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Bison have forfeited.</i>

33:50.628 --> 33:52.994
<i>The Lancers retain the championship.</i>

33:58.102 --> 34:00.127
File this. Thanks.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.365
- Yes.
- Detective Breen.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.204
Mrs. Trager,
I owe you a phone call.

34:05.309 --> 34:09.541
Several. You should've told me
as soon as you identified those remains.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.478
You're not entitled to that.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.315
But isn't Kyle? He's desperate,
detective, to unlock his past

34:15.386 --> 34:17.547
and Professor Kern holds the key.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.647
No, he doesn't.

34:19.724 --> 34:23.091
We've already interviewed
several of his friends and colleagues.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.059
No one recognized Kyle's picture

34:25.129 --> 34:27.460
and Kern never mentioned
knowing a boy.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.656
But Kyle had to have known him.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.860
And they were both there,
in those woods.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.563
Maybe Kyle knows who killed him.

34:33.638 --> 34:37.369
That man was found dead last night.
Drug overdose.

34:38.708 --> 34:42.145
We found several items on him that
belonged to Kern as well as a gun...

34:42.980 --> 34:44.743
...the same one used to kill Kern.

34:44.849 --> 34:48.216
- Why did he kill him?
- A junkie looking for cash.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.754
He had priors.
Attempted murder, assault.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.353
Mrs. Trager...

34:54.425 --> 34:57.394
...we'll keep making every effort
that we can to help Kyle.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.725
But we've found
no link to Professor Kern

34:59.797 --> 35:02.664
and... this murder case is closed.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.606
- It's the professor.
- Yes.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.776
And he's dead?

35:21.152 --> 35:23.382
Does that mean I knew him?

35:23.454 --> 35:26.719
Maybe. So far no one's
been able to make the connection.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.760
But I drew his face before I ever saw
his picture in the paper.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.954
I don't know how to
explain that right now.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.894
That doesn't mean we'll stop trying.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.798
We'll keep working together,
keep looking for answers.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.395
Every time we look for more answers
we only find more questions.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.467
<i>I was so sure
we were on to something.</i>

35:44.542 --> 35:46.442
<i>Now I'm right back where I started.</i>

35:46.511 --> 35:50.675
<i>Kyle, I know you're frustrated.
This is a very complicated situation.</i>

35:53.317 --> 35:54.978
Forfeit? Forfeit?

35:56.087 --> 35:57.554
I'm sorry, Josh.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.489
How could you do it?
How could you not play?

36:05.329 --> 36:07.297
- No, no, no, don't!
- Nope.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.966
Hello?

36:10.968 --> 36:13.732
- Hold on.
- I'm not here.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.107
Don't go anywhere.

36:18.309 --> 36:20.368
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.843
OK. Bye.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.216
What's going on? That's the
tenth call I got this morning.

36:26.284 --> 36:29.344
- I'm popular. What can I say?
- Josh, spill it.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.318
Um...

36:35.393 --> 36:37.725
Can I borrow $200?

36:38.629 --> 36:41.894
- I took bets on the game.
- What?

36:41.966 --> 36:43.831
Well, Kyle was doing so good.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.335
I mean, I got all caught up
in the excitement.

36:46.404 --> 36:49.567
And you thought you'd just cash in.
Great. My son, the bookie.

36:51.676 --> 36:55.510
- I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.
- Hold on, I'm not done.

36:56.547 --> 37:00.244
What do you care what I do?
Like you've even noticed I'm around.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.751
What are you talking about?

37:01.819 --> 37:04.686
You should've seen how
pumped up you got over Kyle.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.985
Just because he's good
at some stupid game.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.424
- Josh...
- You've never been that way with me.

37:09.493 --> 37:14.123
Never, over anything. Now you've got
the son you always wanted.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.127
Hold on.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.299
Oh, Josh.

37:22.607 --> 37:23.869
OK, I admit...

37:24.342 --> 37:27.641
...sometimes I wish you'd be
a little more excited about sports,

37:27.712 --> 37:31.148
but only because then we'd have
something more we could share.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.519
You are the son I've always wanted.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.386
I couldn't hope for any better.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.898
So... you'll spot me the money?

37:53.604 --> 37:55.071
Not a chance.

37:55.139 --> 37:59.098
Use your allowance,
which is cut off effective immediately.

37:59.176 --> 38:02.043
- Dad, I spent it all on video games.
- Then sell them.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.014
You're not gonna play them
for a very long time anyway.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.826
Hey. I thought I'd find you here.

38:27.905 --> 38:29.873
Don't ruin my workout.

38:31.709 --> 38:34.872
I just came to tell you I'm not
gonna fight with you over Declan.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.913
Sweet surrender.

38:39.183 --> 38:40.150
Wait.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.016
That's it?

38:44.121 --> 38:46.089
You're telling me you don't want him?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.324
I don't know if I do.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.862
But I don't want him like this,
that's for sure.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.490
Well... I don't want him either.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.300
He's so not my type.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.401
Then why have you been
throwing yourself at him?

39:05.209 --> 39:06.676
I wouldn't put it that way.

39:06.744 --> 39:09.713
Hilary, it was like two seconds
after I slept with him,

39:09.814 --> 39:14.911
- and there you were, pouncing.
- OK, look. I'm sorry.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.783
I was really pissed at first.

39:17.888 --> 39:21.346
You embarrassed me in front
of everyone at Preston's party.

39:21.425 --> 39:23.893
And I did kind of like
getting back at you.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.555
But the truth is...

39:30.167 --> 39:33.500
...it was like, as long
as we were fighting...

39:40.711 --> 39:43.236
Better fighting than nothing at all.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.748
Pretty stupid, huh?

39:48.185 --> 39:51.154
Totally. Like, maybe you
could've picked up the phone.

39:51.255 --> 39:53.120
Did you forget my number?

39:55.926 --> 39:57.393
OK.

39:59.196 --> 40:00.527
So...

40:01.232 --> 40:02.893
Yeah.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.762
Can we please stop
watching basketball now?

40:07.838 --> 40:11.330
Please. Was that torture?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.570
The worst.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.692
Nice shot.

40:34.365 --> 40:38.324
I just wanted to come by and say
thanks for what you did yesterday.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.463
My doctor said if I'd kept playing,
I would have really done some damage.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.236
Sorry I lost us the championship.

40:45.309 --> 40:49.769
You didn't. What happened
was a team decision.

40:49.847 --> 40:53.214
Hey, there's always next season, right?

40:55.219 --> 40:57.312
The guys want you back, Kyle.

40:59.523 --> 41:00.888
We all do.

41:02.860 --> 41:06.523
Thanks, but... I think
I'll take a break for a while.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.725
If you ever change your mind...

41:11.635 --> 41:13.899
So you want to shoot around?

41:13.971 --> 41:16.633
I can still take you, even on one leg.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.116
<i>We may have lost
the championship,</i>

41:29.220 --> 41:31.381
<i>but I still feel like I'd won...</i>

41:32.323 --> 41:34.848
<i>...because I knew I'd made
a friend who had my back.</i>

41:38.362 --> 41:41.820
<i>The bonds we form with other people
can help us through any setback.</i>

41:47.638 --> 41:51.096
<i>Genuine friendship will survive
any dispute or competition.</i>

42:02.052 --> 42:06.512
<i>And true partnership provides strength
in times of trouble and confusion.</i>
