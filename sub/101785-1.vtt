<i>Guy. You've got to go!</i>

01:02.104 --> 01:04.188
- Guy, it's okay.
- No!

01:04.272 --> 01:08.151
Son, the tar is rising. You've got to go.

No, not without you!

02:59.638 --> 03:03.016
<i>In my defense,
I had been living in a cave my whole life,</i>

03:03.100 --> 03:05.352

other people very often,</i>

03:07.855 --> 03:11.859
<i>And to think, the only two teenagers

03:11.942 --> 03:13.735
<i>It's like fate brought us together.</i>

03:13.819 --> 03:15.821

- Fire.
- Fire.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.873
<i>And now we're traveling the world,</i>

Ooh! Tomorrow.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.381
<i>Isn't Guy amazing?</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:37.718
<i>He gives me a funny feeling,
like I have butterflies in my stomach.</i>

03:37.801 --> 03:41.138
<i>Not just the ones I had
for lunch, but other butterflies.</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:44.183
<i>I don't know what this feeling's called,

03:44.266 --> 03:46.685
<i>And this, and this, and this!</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:50.772
<i>I love drawing this shape!
I don't know why. It just feels right.</i>

03:50.856 --> 03:54.568

Gross. Right, Douglas?

03:56.695 --> 04:00.157
Mom! Thunk is looking at my diary again!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
Thunk, leave your sister alone!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.410
Come on, Eep. Share the tablet.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.579
- I'm not done yet! Give it back!
- No!

04:06.163 --> 04:07.164
Kids, stop fighting.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.041
Get him, Eep! Go for the groin.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.627
I will turn this death cat around!

plenty of obstacles along the way,</i>

We've got some angry kangadillos

Aah!

Belt, seat belt mode.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.864
I told you,
don't take the canyon!

04:40.948 --> 04:43.742
- Okay!
- You never take the canyon!

04:45.077 --> 04:47.329
Whoa!

- Hey.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.023

Ahh!

06:48.158 --> 06:49.618
I still would've eaten that.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.203
All right, pack.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.831
Nothing has tried to kill us in the last

06:57.584 --> 06:59.127
- Here.
- Here's good.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.338
Sandy and Chunky,
you stand watch.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.091
Ugga and I will forage.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.433
Hello! Hey!

07:13.517 --> 07:15.102
You're in charge of the fire.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.855
- No problem, Dad.
- You can count on us, Dad.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.106
Don't call me that!

07:19.648 --> 07:21.733
Hey.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.235
"Hey" what?

07:23.318 --> 07:24.570
Hey, you.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.071
"Hey, you" back.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.699
Uh-uh. I "Hey, you'd" first.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.617
And I'm "heyying" you right back.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.122
Look at them!

07:35.205 --> 07:37.541
Guy used to have so many ideas.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.335
I mean, wasn't he the one
that gave us fire?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.882
Now he's useless!
Th-They'd never survive on their own!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.633
Hungry.

07:46.717 --> 07:51.013
I know, Thunk, and we'll eat our ration
of dry twigs and bitter roots

07:51.096 --> 07:54.558
just as soon as two pack members,
who shall remain nameless,

07:54.641 --> 07:57.394
do their jobs and start the fire!

07:58.020 --> 08:00.814
Come on, man. Just chill.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.568
No, you "come on, man!"
I'm gonna chill your a...

08:04.651 --> 08:05.652
Hey, hey, hey, Grug.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.947
Easy. Calm down, big guy.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.785
You know, Grug, eventually,

08:13.869 --> 08:18.457
Eep and Guy, they're gonna wanna
start their own pack, just like we did.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.541
It's our nature.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.919
No way. Not happening!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.421
The pack is stronger together.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.966
Yes! You did it!

08:28.050 --> 08:30.511
Eep would never leave us. No.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.971
Like Eep would ever... Come on.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.192
No. No!

08:45.275 --> 08:47.444
Pack stays together.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.072
Pack stays together. Pack stays together.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.621
Oh!

08:57.704 --> 09:00.249
Eep. Eep, are you awake?

09:00.332 --> 09:01.333
Yeah.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.168
Hold on. I'm coming over.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.254
Aah!

09:06.255 --> 09:07.631
Oh. Hey, Gran.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.940
Can he hear us?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.192
- Nah. Once he's out, he's out.
- Oh.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.862
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:29.945 --> 09:33.407
No, no. This is a "hey" with a question.
Um...

09:33.490 --> 09:36.076
So, uh, I was thinking...

09:36.827 --> 09:38.412
That's not my hand.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.083
Anyway, uh...

09:43.166 --> 09:45.961
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking about Tomorrow.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.671
Our Tomorrow.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.215
Our Tomorrow?
What do you mean?

09:50.299 --> 09:51.842
What I mean is, um,

09:51.925 --> 09:57.514
maybe our Tomorrow is different
than the rest of... of the pack's.

09:57.598 --> 10:01.476
Maybe our Tomorrow is a place
of our own, you know?

10:01.560 --> 10:04.563
Like a home. Just the two of us.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.148
Just the two of us?

10:06.899 --> 10:10.027
Hmm. Guy, I'd really miss my family.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.031
But that does sound amazing!

10:14.114 --> 10:15.532
A place of our own?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.451
Our home?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.620
Ooh! Can our home have flowers?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.246
Sure can. And butterflies.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.831
And a sweet, babbling brook?

10:22.915 --> 10:24.499
And privacy.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.293
Ooh! What's "privacy"?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.713
It means you only smell the feet
you wanna smell.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.797
Wow.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.716
So, um...

10:33.926 --> 10:37.304
do you, Eep Amber Crood,

10:37.387 --> 10:40.599
think you could
spend your Tomorrow with me?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.312
I do.

10:48.232 --> 10:52.069
I'm going to fall asleep
and dream about our home.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.987
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night, Eep.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.034
Just the two of them?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.374
Warping my baby's mind
with whispers and kisses.

11:05.457 --> 11:09.378
"Can Grug hear us?"
Oh, yeah, Grug hears. Grug hears all.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.005
All about your private
two-person house of Tomorrow,

11:12.089 --> 11:15.092
whispering, kissing,
butter-babble-brooking.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.678
What the heck is that?

11:25.102 --> 11:26.603
Thunk,

11:26.687 --> 11:28.230
make it stop.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.440
Hit snooze!

11:30.524 --> 11:31.608
Stop it, tummy.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.154
Another glorious morning.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.323
What's that? You wanna play?

11:38.407 --> 11:39.575
Go get it, boy!

11:39.658 --> 11:40.784
No, Sandy!

11:40.868 --> 11:43.912
Mom! Sandy's fetching
Douglas's stick again.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.542
Uh, what's that?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.044
Kill circle!

11:56.675 --> 11:58.051
Safety off, babe.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.136
Thanks.

12:03.599 --> 12:06.143
Today is a good day to die!

12:07.477 --> 12:09.438
Hey, everyone!
You'll never guess what I fo...

12:11.398 --> 12:12.983
Oops. Sorry, honey.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.194
We thought you were a predator
trying to kill us.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.487
No, never apologize
for an effective kill circle.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.365
You have to come see this.
Follow me! Come on. This way.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.491
Whoo-hoo!

12:21.575 --> 12:23.452
Yes! You're gonna love it!

12:30.125 --> 12:32.377
- Wow!
- Whoa.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.388
Dun-dun-duh?

12:46.475 --> 12:48.143
What is that?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.562
I've never seen anything like it.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.108
What is it, Mom? Make it leave.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.402
There's something about this.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.366
I think it's... the end of the world.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.618
Looks like I've seen it all.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.580
Well, that's it for me.
I'm glad it's you, Chunky.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.958
It's not the end.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.795
It's just the beginning.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.048
Welcome to our Tomorrow!

13:22.010 --> 13:23.554
- Whoa.
- Wow!

13:23.637 --> 13:24.638
Wow!

13:28.058 --> 13:29.935
Look at all this food!

13:30.018 --> 13:31.603
Guy, are you seeing this?

13:31.687 --> 13:33.814
You're the best dad ever! Let's eat!

13:33.897 --> 13:35.899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One moment, Thunk.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.069
Before we eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

13:39.152 --> 13:43.991
Let this flag mark the day
I discovered our home,

13:44.074 --> 13:47.494
filled with flowers, and butterflies,

13:47.578 --> 13:49.162
and a sweet, babbling brook.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.539
Huh?

13:50.622 --> 13:53.250
Here, right here,
all your needs will be met...

13:53.333 --> 13:55.544
- I'm hungry!
- In a minute!

13:55.627 --> 13:56.795
Go now! He's not looking.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.797
- Whoa!
- Whoa. Ahh.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just a minute. Just a minute. One minute.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.802
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Just wait.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.514
This is our home, a place we'll always
be together forever and ever,

14:07.598 --> 14:08.849
and you're welcome!

14:10.601 --> 14:12.019
I did this.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.353
Problem solved.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.939
Whoo-hoo!

14:16.023 --> 14:18.442
Food!

14:19.026 --> 14:22.112
Isn't it strange how this food
grows in perfectly straight ro...

14:22.196 --> 14:23.197
Ahh!

14:26.074 --> 14:27.075
Whoo-hoo!

14:58.440 --> 15:00.651
I don't feel like eating anymore.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.944
Mom, am I sick?

15:02.027 --> 15:04.488
No, honey. You're full.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.448
Full feels weird.

15:06.532 --> 15:10.244
I can't eat another bite.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.454
Wait.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.875
Yes, I can.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.044
Buh-nah-nuh.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.379
Banana?

15:20.462 --> 15:24.174
I tasted one once, long, long ago.

15:24.258 --> 15:28.178
It was summer.
The sun was warm on my shoulders.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.389
Flowers were in high bloom.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.266
I was just a cub.

15:32.349 --> 15:36.228
Well, I ate that banana in one bite.

15:36.311 --> 15:40.858
And ever since, a day hasn't gone by
without me thinking about it.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.861
What was it like, Father?
What was it like?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.946
No words can describe it, Thunk.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.283
No words are good enough.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.870
We get it, Dad. Just grab the banana!

15:53.829 --> 15:54.997
Come here, sweet thing.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.518
Do you guys hear that?

16:18.020 --> 16:19.438
What is that?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.693
What's happening? I can't see.

16:25.777 --> 16:26.904
It's getting closer!

16:28.197 --> 16:29.656
Kill circle?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.953
Something got over the wall.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.121
Don't get too close.

16:36.205 --> 16:39.875
Who knows what kind of weird
beyond-the-wall creatures they are.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.169
Let's just jab at them from afar.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.504
- Jab!
- Ow!

16:43.587 --> 16:44.922
Jab, jab!

16:45.005 --> 16:46.048
Ah!

16:47.007 --> 16:48.342
Wait a moment.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.553
Look past the matted pelts
and gnashing teeth.

16:51.637 --> 16:55.182
The eyes,
there's a kind of humanity in them.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.476
Ba-na-na.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.520
It's trying to communicate.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.980
Hope, these are people!

17:05.358 --> 17:06.818
Cave people.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.488
I thought cave people died off years ago.

17:13.909 --> 17:19.957
We happy meet you.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.084
In hearts...

17:22.165 --> 17:25.712
...much joy.

17:25.796 --> 17:28.966
- Thanks.
- Much joy to you too.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.301
Oh. They speak beautifully.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.263
Oh, forgive our condescension, friend.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.347
I'm Phil.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.350
And I am Hope. And we are...

17:38.433 --> 17:39.476
The Bettermans.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.395
"Better man"?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.313
- Betterman.
- Emphasis on the "better."

17:43.397 --> 17:45.482
Well, we're the Croods.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.234
- And this is...
- Guy?

17:47.317 --> 17:49.444
Wow. Good guess.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.905
Mr. and Mrs. Betterman?

17:51.989 --> 17:53.907
- Guy!
- What-What's going on here?

17:53.991 --> 17:55.951
- Oh, Guy.
- Guy. Guy!

17:56.034 --> 17:57.828
Hope, it's Guy.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.580
Guy, Guy, Guy.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.206
What's going on here?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.168
I grew up with Hope and Phil.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.837
They were
my parents' best friends until...

18:06.920 --> 18:07.963
Oh, Guy.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.632
We thought we lost your whole family.

18:10.716 --> 18:15.012
That was the moment we realized,
in such a dangerous world,

18:15.095 --> 18:17.723
there had to be a better way to live.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.893
Wha...

18:20.976 --> 18:22.311
Is that your home?

18:22.394 --> 18:24.730
Whoa! That's their home!

18:24.813 --> 18:26.857
- Whoa, mama!
- Look, Dad!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.859
Wow.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.611
Hey, Guy, race you to the top.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.157
Oh, um, excuse me, little tiger girl?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.618
- Uh, we don't climb this tree.
- Huh?

18:37.701 --> 18:40.537
- There's a "Betterman" way.
- Unofficial motto.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.081
- Ooh.
- Okay, everybody in?

18:43.165 --> 18:44.666
Ah!

18:44.750 --> 18:48.420
Yeah, the, um, death cat
will have to stay outside.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.631
See ya, Chunky.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.008
Sorry. Animals track in too much...

18:53.592 --> 18:55.636
um, dirt.

18:55.719 --> 18:56.803
Going up.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.805
Whoa! What's happening?

19:01.225 --> 19:02.434
Oh.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.772
Welcome to the Betterman home!

19:06.855 --> 19:07.981
Wow!

19:08.065 --> 19:09.358
It's beautiful!

19:09.441 --> 19:11.318
Kind of big, isn't it?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.570
What?

19:14.154 --> 19:18.659
Whoa! I can see the clouds!
But I'm inside.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.869
What is this? What is this?

19:20.953 --> 19:23.664
Uh, we call that a window.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.708
Window.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.711
Okay.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.798
Guy, Dawn will be so happy to see you.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.174
- Dawn?
- Dawn?

19:34.258 --> 19:35.801
Yeah, yeah. We grew up together.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.469
Oh, Dawn!

19:37.553 --> 19:38.720
Ahh!

19:38.804 --> 19:42.015
Oh. That's just your reflection.
It's called a mirror.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.350
Oh, sorry.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.476
Dawn!

19:45.686 --> 19:47.563
- Sorry.
- Dawn!

19:48.021 --> 19:49.189
Where is she?

19:49.273 --> 19:51.817
- I'm in the panic cubby!
- Panic cubby!

19:51.900 --> 19:54.528
Dawn, it wasn't wild animals.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.154
It's safe to come out.

19:59.741 --> 20:03.078
Mom, maybe we should drill some air holes
in the door of the panic cubby?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.247
No air holes. Snakes could get in.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.583
But you'll never believe
who we just found.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.335
- Guy?
- Dawn?

20:10.419 --> 20:12.671
Guy! Is it really you?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.089
It's you! You're here!

20:14.173 --> 20:18.010
You're so old! So are you!
That's what I said!

20:18.093 --> 20:19.094
Oh, together again.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.930
These two were inseparable
when they were young.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.724
Inseparable.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.309
Dawn's a girl?

20:27.978 --> 20:30.314
Hold on, stop.
You accessorize with a sloth?

20:30.397 --> 20:33.150
I accessorize with a sloth!
This is Belt!

20:35.527 --> 20:38.155
- Mine's Sash.
- Ooh la la.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.157
Oh, oh! These are the Croods.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.241
- Hello.
- Hey.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.910
- 'Sup?
- And this...

20:42.993 --> 20:44.411
Wait. Nope, nope.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.871
Yeah. This is Eep.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.748
- You're a girl?
- Yeah.

20:47.831 --> 20:48.999
A girl...

20:49.082 --> 20:50.375
friend!

20:50.459 --> 20:52.628
I've never had a girlfriend before!

20:52.711 --> 20:54.046
- Me either! Me either!
- Girlfriends!

20:54.129 --> 20:55.464
Okay, careful! Small bones.

20:55.547 --> 20:56.965
Extra vertebrae!

20:57.049 --> 20:58.550
- This is amazing!
- What do we do?

20:58.634 --> 21:00.761
- What do we say to each other?
- What's happening to our voices?

21:00.844 --> 21:03.347
Why are our voices getting so high?

21:08.018 --> 21:11.980
As our houseguests,
you're welcome to anything you want.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.858
I know what I want.

21:16.068 --> 21:18.070
Uh, except for that.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.988
But there's so many of them.

21:20.072 --> 21:21.198
Uh, sorry, Grug.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.159
I'm afraid we have one house rule here.

21:24.243 --> 21:25.577
We don't eat the bananas.

21:25.661 --> 21:26.787
But they're right here.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.873
Anything else, anything at all,
is yours to enjoy.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.960
But we don't eat the bananas.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.128
- Really?
- Heh?

21:35.212 --> 21:37.422
- No bananas?
- Heh?

21:37.506 --> 21:38.507
But...

21:38.590 --> 21:40.467
We won't eat your bananas.

21:40.551 --> 21:42.469
It's getting late, so...

21:42.553 --> 21:44.972
Well, we can just sleep-pile right here.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.182
Got it. Solid spot, Dad.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.893
Look, Phil. They sleep in a pile.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.895
- Ooh, fun!
- Nuh-uh.

21:51.979 --> 21:54.857
Actually, everyone gets their own rooms.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.401
We get separate rooms!

21:57.484 --> 21:59.528
- What's a room?
- What's a separate?

21:59.611 --> 22:02.573
We Bettermans believe
that privacy promotes individuality.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.032
Unofficial motto.

22:04.116 --> 22:08.412
Well, we Croods believe that
the pack sticks together no matter...

22:08.495 --> 22:09.496
What?

22:09.580 --> 22:11.290
Tell me about my room,
Mr. Better-dad.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.292
Well, son, it's right this way.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.378
It all started with a tree and an idea.

22:19.590 --> 22:23.051
Wow. What a day.

22:23.135 --> 22:25.554
I never thought
I'd see the Bettermans again.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.847
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

22:26.930 --> 22:27.931
Wow.

22:28.015 --> 22:30.434
Sure beats the view
from any cave I know.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.269
Yeah,
I can't believe this place.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.858
Oh, this bed is so comfortable.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.694
Ah, nobody's foot in my mouth.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.280
So much better.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.115
Yeah.

22:45.699 --> 22:51.371
So, is this that privacy thing
you were telling me about?

22:51.455 --> 22:52.956
Just feels kind of...

22:53.957 --> 22:55.709
far... you know?

22:57.336 --> 22:58.337
Guy?

22:58.837 --> 22:59.838
Guy?

23:01.673 --> 23:02.758
Guy?

23:05.219 --> 23:09.389
Time to watch some late-night window.

23:09.473 --> 23:11.767
Ooh, ooh. Check it out, Douglas.
This guy's my favorite.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.522
Okay, moommoth. Whatcha gonna do now?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.734
Oh! What an idiot!

23:35.165 --> 23:36.375
Ugga?

23:38.377 --> 23:39.545
Ugga.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.800
- Ugga!
- Kill circle!

23:45.551 --> 23:47.469
Oh. Hey, honey.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.221
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

23:49.304 --> 23:52.599
All these separate rooms.
Who could live in a place like this?

23:52.683 --> 23:53.684
Well...

23:53.767 --> 23:57.271
And there's something off about that
Phil Betterman guy. Like, way off.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.356
Grug, you know what I think?

23:59.439 --> 24:01.275
Maybe we could stay.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.944
Excuse me?
You're thinking about staying here?

24:04.027 --> 24:07.698
No. I want to be in the wild
fighting vulture rats for scraps.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.575
- Of course I want to stay.
- Yeah, but...

24:09.658 --> 24:10.951
- It's nice here.
- But...

24:11.034 --> 24:14.079
And you were just worried about
your daughter leaving,

24:14.162 --> 24:16.665
but the pack is together.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.749
Sort of.

24:17.833 --> 24:21.295
If you give this place a chance,
you might actually like it here.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.257
Do I have to like Phil?

24:25.340 --> 24:27.676
You have to be nice. No hitting.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.636
Okay.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.638
But if I have to be alone...

24:34.057 --> 24:35.809
I'm gonna be alone with you.

24:36.852 --> 24:39.104
I mean, can you believe it?

24:39.188 --> 24:43.275
After all these years,
and Guy shows up on our doorstep.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.237
And to think that we were worrying
about Dawn being alone.

24:47.321 --> 24:48.572
And now Guy's back!

24:48.655 --> 24:50.782
It's like fate
brought them back together.

24:50.866 --> 24:52.659
Like it was meant to be.

24:52.743 --> 24:57.539
But did you see the way
that cave girl was holding Guy's hand?

24:57.623 --> 24:58.457
Hmm.

24:58.540 --> 25:02.252
You don't think Guy could possibly
be serious about that Meep?

25:02.336 --> 25:03.962
Or "Peep"? Or is it "Eep"?

25:04.046 --> 25:05.297
"Eep." It's "Eep," right?

25:05.380 --> 25:09.426
Well, I'm just not sure
Eep fits in here. You know?

25:09.510 --> 25:12.054
In fact, none of them do.

25:12.137 --> 25:16.350
Poor things do seem to struggle
with the concept of walls.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.561
I don't know if cave people
belong in a modern world.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.438
Aah!

25:21.522 --> 25:23.815
I'm going to watch window forever!

25:24.483 --> 25:25.776
Do they know that?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.570
I feel like we just need to
help them understand

25:28.654 --> 25:30.697
that they have a bright future...

25:30.781 --> 25:32.324
outside these walls.

25:34.368 --> 25:37.913
And Guy's future is inside the walls.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.748
With Dawn.

25:39.831 --> 25:42.543
Hope Betterman, always thinking of others.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.586
Honestly, I just can't help it.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.888
Ooh, that was...

25:54.972 --> 25:57.724
...hands down,
the best night's sleep I've gotten in...

25:57.808 --> 25:59.059
- Morning, Guy!
- Oh!

25:59.142 --> 26:00.227
Hi, Mr. Betterman.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.562
Fresh bitter bean juice?

26:01.645 --> 26:04.189
Uh, thank you?

26:04.273 --> 26:06.233
- Hi, Guy!
- Ah! Mrs. Betterman.

26:06.316 --> 26:08.694
These are for you.
I made them last night.

26:11.822 --> 26:13.574
Oh, uh, I should wake Eep up.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.535
You know, it's been seven hours
since I said, uh, "Hey."

26:16.618 --> 26:18.453
That's adorable!

26:18.537 --> 26:22.040
You know, let's let that poor Eep sleep.
She must be exhausted.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.209
- Nah, I'm sure she's...
- Oh, look!

26:24.293 --> 26:27.004
Here's Dawn! What a coincidence.

26:27.087 --> 26:30.632
Why, Dawn, whatever are you doing
on this particular rope bridge

26:30.716 --> 26:33.218
at this particular moment in time?

26:34.219 --> 26:36.346
My morning chores?

26:36.430 --> 26:38.056
Morning chores!

26:51.236 --> 26:52.279
Genius.

26:57.159 --> 26:58.160
Genius!

26:58.243 --> 26:59.369
Genius!

27:00.245 --> 27:01.330
Genius!

27:01.413 --> 27:03.832
Genius! Genius! Genius!

27:06.752 --> 27:07.878
Genius.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.593
Genius. Mmm.

27:20.182 --> 27:22.267
- Boom.
- Boom.

27:22.351 --> 27:24.019
Couldn't sleep last night.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.354
Me neither.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.481
When I woke up,
your mom was missing.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.900
You don't think
a predator took her, do you?

27:29.983 --> 27:31.443
Nope. Found her.

27:35.656 --> 27:37.533
It's like this place is changing everyone.

27:37.616 --> 27:40.619
We don't sleep-pile anymore.
We don't wake up together.

27:40.702 --> 27:43.455
And Thunk just stares at that box.

27:43.539 --> 27:44.915
Ohh.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.668
Not now, Douglas. The birds are on.

27:47.751 --> 27:51.213
Dad, relax. It's been one night.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.590
And a little change can be... Guy?

27:56.969 --> 27:58.554
- Hey.
- Guy?

27:58.637 --> 28:02.558
Wow. You're you,
but you don't look like you.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.019
And you smell like flowers.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.646
And soft rain.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.857
More like a clear mountain stream.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.775
With just a hint of vanilla.

28:11.859 --> 28:14.444
It's called a shower.
You should try it.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.406
You want me to smell like vanilla?

28:17.489 --> 28:18.657
Just a hint.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.367
What happened to your clothes?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.578
We burned his clothes
while he was in the shower.

28:22.661 --> 28:26.790
In fact, they were so dirty
that we washed them and then burned them.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.007
Come on, Thunk. We're going outside.

28:35.090 --> 28:37.342
I don't wanna.
I'm watching birds.

28:37.426 --> 28:40.387
In my day, we didn't stare at birds.
We fought them.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.847
Let me live my life!

28:41.930 --> 28:43.932
Hey, new friend girl!
Want some breakfast?

28:44.016 --> 28:45.309
Uh, sure!

28:45.392 --> 28:47.060
Oh! I'll start the fire again.

28:47.144 --> 28:48.187
Fire.

28:49.813 --> 28:53.150
Hey.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.693
Hey, yeah. Check this out.

28:58.447 --> 29:01.909
Now, that's how you make a fire.
You don't need two people anymore.

29:01.992 --> 29:05.204
I can't believe how much time
I wasted clacking rocks. This is amazing!

29:05.287 --> 29:08.457
And it's such a time-saver,
and it's so simple.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.000
No more smashed fingers.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.543
The Bettermans really do...

29:20.928 --> 29:25.349
Oh, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.

29:25.432 --> 29:28.727
Whoa. We are really up here!

29:28.810 --> 29:31.480
Do I smell weird to you?

29:32.022 --> 29:34.525
You smell... different.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.360
Like river rocks with, uh...

29:37.361 --> 29:39.154
a hint of moss.

29:40.197 --> 29:41.907
Whoa! What's that mark on your wrist?

29:41.990 --> 29:43.784
Oh, it's just a scar.

29:43.867 --> 29:44.868
Scar?

29:44.952 --> 29:47.412
Yeah, from a thorned crab.
No big deal.

29:47.496 --> 29:49.081
Whoa! And that?

29:49.706 --> 29:50.707
Razor worm.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.751
- Well, what about that one?
- Scorpion badger.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.379
Swamp snake, sky snake, volcano,

29:55.462 --> 29:56.630
end of the world,

29:56.713 --> 30:00.050
my little sister, my little sister,
my little sister. She bites a lot.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.803
And my dad doesn't even know
about this one.

30:02.886 --> 30:06.098
Whoa. Peanut toe.

30:07.266 --> 30:10.185
Every mark is an adventure!

30:10.269 --> 30:12.855
My parents won't even let me have scars.

30:12.938 --> 30:15.899
That's why they built the wall.
To keep me safe.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.863
You're not allowed outside the wall?

30:20.946 --> 30:24.366
Nope, not since
what happened to Guy's family.

30:25.033 --> 30:27.828
So, this farm...

30:28.620 --> 30:30.831
is like your cave.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.416
You're just like me!

30:33.750 --> 30:34.751
Come on.

30:36.795 --> 30:39.381
Oh, man. Is this your ride?

30:39.464 --> 30:40.924
Nah, it's my dad's.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.015
Listen to this baby purr.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.642
- See that pig gator over there?
- Yeah.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.561
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.440
Whoo!

30:56.523 --> 30:58.817
- See that chicken seal over there?
- Yeah.

30:58.901 --> 31:00.110
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

31:00.777 --> 31:01.987
Whoo!

31:02.070 --> 31:03.947
- You see that wall?
- Yeah!

31:04.031 --> 31:05.991
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

31:06.074 --> 31:09.161
No! Eep, I'm not allowed
to go outside the wall!

31:09.244 --> 31:11.997
Don't worry.
We'll be back before anyone knows.

31:28.889 --> 31:30.557
Are you okay?

31:30.641 --> 31:32.809
Whoo-hoo!

31:32.893 --> 31:36.563
Oh, my gosh! My heart is pounding!
I feel so alive!

31:37.314 --> 31:39.900
Let's jump more stuff.

31:39.983 --> 31:43.695
Whoo!

31:44.863 --> 31:46.365
Ready?

31:46.448 --> 31:47.449
Let's do it.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.953
Yeah!

31:51.036 --> 31:52.955
Again! Something bigger!

31:53.038 --> 31:54.331
Uh...

31:54.414 --> 31:56.375
Oh! Mrs. Betterman.

31:56.458 --> 31:59.169
We were just checking out this invention.
What's it for?

31:59.253 --> 32:01.880
Um... It... W...

32:01.964 --> 32:03.799
You know, why don't you ask Phil?

32:03.882 --> 32:06.593
He spends a lot of time in there.

32:06.677 --> 32:09.012
Anyway, here.

32:09.096 --> 32:10.973
I thought you might want to have this.

32:11.723 --> 32:13.684
It's some old pictures of our families.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.687
Oh.

32:16.770 --> 32:17.855
Thank you.

32:18.939 --> 32:21.608
Whoa!

32:22.234 --> 32:23.652
Where does this go?

32:24.236 --> 32:28.156
Dad, what if I miss something?
I wanna go back inside.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.451
No, Thunk. Play with Douglas.
He's feeling left out.

32:31.535 --> 32:34.788
And he's sad that everyone isn't
spending time together anymore.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.293
All right.
You wanna play fetch, Douglas?

32:39.376 --> 32:42.796
Yeah? Okay. Okay. Go get it!

32:43.213 --> 32:44.840
Oh!

32:44.923 --> 32:47.259
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

32:47.342 --> 32:49.344
I'm going back to the window!

32:51.346 --> 32:53.390
Hey! There he is!

32:53.473 --> 32:56.435
Grug! Over here, buddy.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.312
Let's go for a ride.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.397
Grug. Gruggers.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.565
G-G-G-Grug.

33:01.648 --> 33:02.649
Grug.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.236
Grug? Grug.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.030
Wanna go for that ride?

33:08.113 --> 33:09.907
Pretty impressive, eh, Grug?

33:09.990 --> 33:11.241
Funny story,

33:11.325 --> 33:16.997
everything you see before you used to be
a sad, hopeless, dust-filled wasteland.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.498
That doesn't sound funny.

33:18.582 --> 33:20.834
But through the power of higher thought,

33:20.918 --> 33:25.297
I devised a way to get all the water
from that high mountain source

33:25.380 --> 33:26.507
to flow down here.

33:26.590 --> 33:27.799
How interesting.

33:27.883 --> 33:31.428
Yup, I turned a barren desert
into a lush oasis.

33:31.512 --> 33:33.972
Now we have all the water we need
and then some.

33:34.056 --> 33:36.475
Matter of fact, we're thinking of
putting in a new...

33:36.558 --> 33:38.435
- Ooh, banana.
- No!

33:38.519 --> 33:39.728
Ow.

33:39.811 --> 33:40.938
What'd you do that for?

33:41.021 --> 33:44.525
Sorry. I'm afraid I must remind you
of our one rule.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.360
We don't eat the bananas.

33:46.443 --> 33:49.696
Well, why not?
I mean, they're everywhere!

33:49.780 --> 33:53.116
Look! You got a whole bowl full of them
over there. Who are those for?

33:53.200 --> 33:55.577
Grug, we could talk about fruit all day.

33:55.661 --> 33:56.870
Or...

33:56.954 --> 33:59.164
do you wanna see something really cool?

33:59.248 --> 34:00.499
I don't know.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.639
Hey. Fixing yourself a snack?

34:16.723 --> 34:20.686
Oh, I thought I'd clean up a little.
Noticed we made a bit of a mess yesterday.

34:20.768 --> 34:24.690
Oh, no. I hadn't noticed.

34:24.773 --> 34:27.693
Um, you can just put that over there
in the compost bin.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.777
Oh, smart.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.574
Good job.

34:34.658 --> 34:38.161
Well, we didn't want you to think
we're a family of savages.

34:39.955 --> 34:41.831
Savages.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.750
Sandy, drop it.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.210
Drop it!

34:46.295 --> 34:48.088
Kids, right?

34:48.172 --> 34:51.382
So, Ugga,
you must really miss the wild.

34:51.466 --> 34:53.844
- Right? With the hunting...
- Not really.

34:53.927 --> 34:56.263
- ...and the gathering...
- Not really.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.182
...the baying at the moon.

34:59.558 --> 35:00.893
Not at all.

35:00.976 --> 35:03.604
Honestly, it sucks out there.

35:03.687 --> 35:07.441
If no one's died before breakfast,
it's a win.

35:07.524 --> 35:10.277
It is so much better in here.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.570
Oh.

35:11.653 --> 35:12.821
That's nice.

35:14.406 --> 35:15.449
Yeah.

35:15.532 --> 35:19.536
Actually, Grug and I were thinking
that maybe we...

35:19.620 --> 35:22.289
Ah! I almost forgot. I made this for you.

35:22.372 --> 35:23.832
- A basket?
- Mm-hmm.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.877
Well, it's more like-like a travel basket.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.337
Travel basket?

35:28.420 --> 35:29.838
Yeah, for the road.

35:29.922 --> 35:34.301
It's got fruit, nuts, soap, more soap
and a neck pillow.

35:34.843 --> 35:38.639
Oh. Yeah. This'll be great...
for the road.

35:39.389 --> 35:40.766
Thank you.

35:40.849 --> 35:43.810
It's the least we can do
to thank you for bringing Guy home.

35:43.894 --> 35:45.187
- Home?
- Home.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.271
Guy?

35:46.355 --> 35:47.689
Guy's home. You got it.

35:47.773 --> 35:49.858
Well, gotta go.
See you at dinner, okay?

35:55.656 --> 35:58.575
Yeah!

35:58.659 --> 36:02.204
Whoo!

36:02.829 --> 36:04.414
Ooh!

36:04.498 --> 36:06.250
Huh? Whoa!

36:08.252 --> 36:12.047
Whoa.

36:12.130 --> 36:15.384
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

36:17.302 --> 36:18.554
Yeah!

36:22.349 --> 36:24.101
Whoa!

36:35.779 --> 36:37.906
Ooh!

36:37.990 --> 36:40.951
Ahh! Eep!

36:44.121 --> 36:45.622
Eep?

37:00.220 --> 37:03.724
Ow.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.310
I have a scar.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.436
You have a scar!

37:07.519 --> 37:09.271
- I have a scar!
- Yeah!

37:09.354 --> 37:10.522
Ow!

37:13.317 --> 37:16.278
Don't tell Mrs. Betterman,

37:16.361 --> 37:19.948
but while she thinks
I'm toiling in the hot sun,

37:20.032 --> 37:21.867
I'm actually in here,

37:21.950 --> 37:23.368
my man cave.

37:23.994 --> 37:26.580
It's hot in here.

37:26.663 --> 37:30.626
Grug, you might be more comfortable
if you removed your fur pelt.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.044
I-I already did.

37:32.878 --> 37:33.879
Right.

37:33.962 --> 37:38.550
Yeah, it's a place a father
can escape the chaos of family life.

37:38.634 --> 37:41.136
Relax, hang with his bros,

37:41.220 --> 37:43.722
if bros he has.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.390
Another shark milk?

37:45.474 --> 37:50.145
So, you come in here
to hide from your family?

37:50.229 --> 37:53.690
Not hide, help. I help my family.

37:57.486 --> 38:00.239
So, uh,

38:00.322 --> 38:01.865
how does this help your family?

38:01.949 --> 38:03.325
Yeah.

38:03.408 --> 38:07.829
This is where I find solutions
to my family's biggest problems.

38:09.248 --> 38:10.415
Okay.

38:10.499 --> 38:14.044
So, feeling relaxed? Comfortable?

38:14.127 --> 38:16.547
Susceptible to suggestion?

38:18.507 --> 38:20.092
What's your problem, big guy?

38:20.175 --> 38:22.177
I don't have a problem.

38:22.261 --> 38:24.721
Come on, Grug.
I've seen you moping around.

38:24.805 --> 38:25.848
What's your problem?

38:25.931 --> 38:27.933
I'm hot. That-That's my problem.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.393
Knock, knock.

38:29.476 --> 38:32.688
I'm knocking on the door, big guy.
Open it.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.439
No.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.775
- Open up to me.
- No.

38:36.859 --> 38:40.028
- Share with me.
- Uh-uh. I don't wanna. I'm hot.

38:40.112 --> 38:41.405
Tell me your problem.

38:41.488 --> 38:42.906
I don't have a problem.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.449
You have a problem.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.743
Tell me your problem.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.161
- I don't...
- Tell me.

38:48.245 --> 38:49.121
- I don't...
- Tell me.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.539
- I don't...
- Tell me. Tell me.

38:50.622 --> 38:52.708
I don't like it here, all right?

38:52.791 --> 38:55.586
My pack's all split up.
There's no one to sleep-pile with.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.754
You won't let me eat bananas.

38:57.838 --> 39:00.632
Guy gave Eep a rock.
He kissed my hand.

39:00.716 --> 39:02.843
They're planning on leaving the pack.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.428
And I don't like you at all!

39:04.511 --> 39:06.638
Hmm. Now, that's interesting.

39:06.722 --> 39:09.808
You know, maybe I just
need to get to know you better.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.853
No, not that.
The part about Eep and Guy.

39:12.936 --> 39:16.064
Oh. Guy's trying to take my daughter away.

39:16.148 --> 39:19.276
Father to father,
I worry about my daughter too.

39:19.359 --> 39:22.112
She was so lonely
before Guy came back.

39:22.196 --> 39:23.322
Yeah.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.908
It's almost like Guy's the problem.

39:25.991 --> 39:29.328
Wait a minute. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

39:29.411 --> 39:31.205
Yes. No.

39:31.288 --> 39:32.873
I don't know. Hot.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.625
Are you suggesting...

39:34.708 --> 39:38.378
...we take Guy off your hands
so Dawn isn't lonely,

39:38.462 --> 39:41.381
and Eep stays with you,
with your pack?

39:42.382 --> 39:44.218
Uh, am I?

39:44.301 --> 39:47.262
Why, Grug, that's a truly great idea.

39:47.346 --> 39:49.932
You've done it!
You've solved both our problems.

39:50.474 --> 39:53.060
No. Really?

39:53.143 --> 39:54.770
So, we have a deal, bro?

39:56.480 --> 39:57.523
Deal.

40:03.111 --> 40:06.198
Hey, Ugga!
I just had the best time with Phil!

40:06.281 --> 40:09.409
Look at me.
Standing up straight, got lots of ideas.

40:09.493 --> 40:11.078
You know, Phil's a good listener.

40:11.161 --> 40:14.456
He knows a smart idea
when he hears... one.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.044
Heh.

40:19.127 --> 40:22.756
The Bettermans want us
to leave without Guy.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.134
- Oh, um... You think so, huh?
- As if we would ever do that.

40:26.218 --> 40:28.136
- Well...
- Guy's a member of our pack.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.221
Kind of.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.599
And can you imagine what that would do
to Eep? It would absolutely destroy her!

40:32.683 --> 40:34.142
Well, initially.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.228
They think we're just simple cave people.

40:36.311 --> 40:39.481
That we're so stupid,
we'd trade Guy for a fruit basket.

40:40.315 --> 40:43.151
And then she tried to
make me think it was my idea!

40:43.235 --> 40:46.446
- That is a great idea.
- Betterman.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.365
As if we'd ever do that!

40:48.448 --> 40:50.617
- So we have a deal?
- Betterman.

40:50.701 --> 40:52.703
They must think
we're pretty stupid.

40:52.786 --> 40:55.831
You've done it, Grug. Thinking man.
You're not stupid.

40:55.914 --> 40:57.457
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

40:58.166 --> 40:59.751
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

41:00.669 --> 41:02.963
Betterman!

41:06.967 --> 41:08.927
Maybe we should
take it down a notch, honey.

41:10.596 --> 41:14.141
We gotta focus. We've gotta get Guy
and get out of here.

41:14.224 --> 41:15.851
Okay. But first,

41:15.934 --> 41:20.355
there's something I've wanted to do
for a really, really long time.

41:24.985 --> 41:28.614
Ah. I can't believe they kept
these old picture albums.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.490
That's the Bettermans.

41:30.574 --> 41:34.453
Okay, this is my mom,
this is my dad, and that's me.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.873
Yeah, I get it. I was skinny.

41:41.376 --> 41:44.713
It's pretty great here, huh, Belt?

41:46.965 --> 41:48.300
Shh!

41:55.307 --> 41:57.935
Whee!

41:58.018 --> 42:00.270
Shh.

42:02.231 --> 42:04.733
Is that my dad? Hide me!

42:04.816 --> 42:06.026
Mr. Betterman?

42:07.486 --> 42:08.612
"Mr. Betterman"?

42:08.695 --> 42:12.282
It's just Guy. Hi, Guy!

42:12.366 --> 42:13.575
Hey, you.

42:13.659 --> 42:16.078
- Where'd you go?
- Took Chunky for a joyride.

42:16.161 --> 42:18.288
- Joyride!
- Joyride?

42:18.372 --> 42:19.831
We rolled the death...

42:19.915 --> 42:21.333
- Outside the wall.
- ...cat!

42:21.416 --> 42:24.837
You took Dawn for a joyride

42:24.920 --> 42:26.630
- outside the wall?
- Yeah.

42:26.713 --> 42:28.882
The Bettermans don't want Dawn
outside the wall.

42:28.966 --> 42:32.386
They built the wall for a reason,
you know, to keep everyone safe.

42:32.469 --> 42:33.804
Guy, relax.

42:33.887 --> 42:37.516
Yeah, Guy, take it down low.

42:38.267 --> 42:39.309
What's wrong with her?

42:39.393 --> 42:41.144
It's just a reaction to the bee venom.

42:41.228 --> 42:43.438
- Bee venom?
- Bee venom!

42:43.522 --> 42:44.648
What the...

42:45.774 --> 42:47.609
- It's just a little bee sting.
- "Little"?

42:47.693 --> 42:50.696
Hey, you're not the boss of me.

42:50.779 --> 42:51.905
This is a very severe...

42:51.989 --> 42:53.282
Shh.

42:53.365 --> 42:56.243
Eep, this is a very severe bee sting!

42:56.326 --> 42:58.453
- "This is a very severe bee sting."
- She's fine.

42:58.537 --> 42:59.830
No, no. She's not fine.

42:59.913 --> 43:01.582
- I'm fine.
- Dawn!

43:01.665 --> 43:05.377
Eep, that was not smart.
She could have been seriously hurt.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.379
You gotta think about these things!

43:07.462 --> 43:10.048
Why are you acting like this?
You like adventures.

43:10.132 --> 43:13.635
No! No. I like not dying.
Things are different now.

43:14.219 --> 43:15.888
But she needed to get out.

43:15.971 --> 43:18.557
She's just like me.
This is her cave!

43:18.640 --> 43:21.185
No, she's not like you.
This is not her cave!

43:21.268 --> 43:22.644
She's not a cave girl.

43:24.605 --> 43:26.023
"Cave girl"?

43:31.069 --> 43:33.447
What does he mean by "cave girl"?

43:33.530 --> 43:35.324
I'll give him a cave girl!

43:43.790 --> 43:46.251
I trust you've all brought your appetites.

43:46.335 --> 43:48.504
Chef Hope's been working hard all day.

43:48.587 --> 43:51.632
Mmm.
This is so good, Mrs. Better-mom.

43:52.216 --> 43:54.468
You're eating the flower arrangement.

43:56.970 --> 43:58.013
Wow.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.933
Uh, Grug, Ugga,
what can we offer you?

44:01.016 --> 44:02.142
Ah, we're good.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.811
Yeah, we ate a little something
on the way over.

44:04.895 --> 44:06.939
Oops. Pardon me.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.398
Eh...

44:08.482 --> 44:09.608
Okay.

44:09.691 --> 44:10.692
Oh, look!

44:10.776 --> 44:12.945
- Oh!
- Guy and Dawn are here...

44:13.028 --> 44:14.780
...together.

44:16.448 --> 44:17.824
You good to do this?

44:17.908 --> 44:19.952
Just try to keep your giant hand
out of sight.

44:20.035 --> 44:21.119
- Gotcha!
- Ah!

44:26.166 --> 44:29.044
Oh, welcome, Eep.
Your seat is over here, next to...

44:29.127 --> 44:30.128
Gran.

44:31.922 --> 44:34.800
We're not done.
You called me a cave girl.

44:34.883 --> 44:37.553
But y-y-you are a cave girl.

44:38.929 --> 44:42.015
But you said "cave girl"
like it's a bad thing.

44:42.099 --> 44:45.269
What's wrong with cave people, Guy?

44:45.352 --> 44:47.104
There's nothing wrong with cave people.

44:47.187 --> 44:48.897
Can I get you a towel
or a utensil or something?

44:51.859 --> 44:53.110
I'm good.

44:53.193 --> 44:54.528
Why are you acting like this?

44:54.611 --> 44:56.530
I'm just acting like a cave girl, Guy.

44:56.613 --> 44:58.615
But I guess that's not good enough
for you anymore.

44:58.699 --> 44:59.741
I never said that.

44:59.825 --> 45:02.578
Grug, let's take this moment
to talk about your great idea.

45:02.661 --> 45:03.745
Uh, what?

45:03.829 --> 45:05.622
Grug felt, and I concurred,

45:05.706 --> 45:09.001
that Guy should be
with his kind of people, evolved people.

45:09.084 --> 45:10.794
And Eep should stay with her kind.

45:10.878 --> 45:13.839
- So we made a deal.
- Say again?

45:13.922 --> 45:14.965
- What deal?
- His deal!

45:15.799 --> 45:17.801
- Your idea.
- Your idea?

45:17.885 --> 45:20.304
Guy stays with us,
and Eep stays with her pack.

45:20.387 --> 45:21.680
Grug's words, not mine.

45:21.763 --> 45:24.099
- You tried to get rid of me?
- Really, Dad?

45:24.183 --> 45:25.601
No! Honey, I don't think that.

45:25.684 --> 45:27.978
I mean, he made me think
that I thought that.

45:28.061 --> 45:29.479
He tricked me!

45:29.563 --> 45:31.607
He took me
into his stupid secret man cave,

45:31.690 --> 45:32.983
and he tricked me.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.401
What's a man cave?

45:34.484 --> 45:37.196
It's a place I go to get away.

45:37.279 --> 45:38.488
Away from what?

45:38.572 --> 45:40.574
Away from you! Duh!

45:40.657 --> 45:42.743
- What?
- We're all thinking it.

45:42.826 --> 45:44.703
- How dare you?
- How dare you!

45:44.786 --> 45:46.246
How dare the both of you!

45:46.330 --> 45:48.832
You're trying to fix me up with Guy?

45:48.916 --> 45:50.334
What happened to your hand?

45:50.417 --> 45:52.211
Oh. I got stung by a bee. Oh!

45:52.294 --> 45:53.921
Outside the wall. Oh!

45:54.004 --> 45:56.423
- You went outside the wall?
- Outside the wall?

45:56.507 --> 45:58.717
- This is all your fault!
- Oh! Our fault?

45:58.800 --> 45:59.801
Can I say something?

45:59.885 --> 46:01.011
- No!
- Okay.

46:01.094 --> 46:03.180
I can't believe
you actually made that deal.

46:03.263 --> 46:05.724
- What did they do to you?
- I got scars.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.017
Our baby!

46:07.100 --> 46:08.477
It was really hot.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.355
I was full of shark milk.
I was naked!

46:11.438 --> 46:13.023
Why, Phil? Why?

46:13.106 --> 46:16.944
Because privacy promotes individuality!
Unofficial motto!

46:17.027 --> 46:19.571
Well, kiddo, looks like
we all have something to hide.

46:24.493 --> 46:26.745
That's it! Come on, Guy. We're leaving.

46:26.828 --> 46:29.456
Wait, hold on a second.
First, you wanted to get rid of me, Grug,

46:29.540 --> 46:31.250
and now you want me to come with you?

46:31.333 --> 46:32.835
You were trying to take my daughter away!

46:32.918 --> 46:36.129
Promising my baby girl butterflies
and babbling brooks.

46:36.213 --> 46:37.506
Aha!

46:37.589 --> 46:39.341
You see? I knew you were listening.

46:39.424 --> 46:41.301
There is no privacy with you people.

46:41.385 --> 46:43.387
Oh, you mean cave people?

46:43.470 --> 46:44.555
Not what I said.

46:44.638 --> 46:48.684
Positives, Eep, that's all I'm saying.
Lots of things here are better.

46:48.767 --> 46:53.063
- "Better"?
- Like not starving, no sleep pile.

46:53.146 --> 46:57.401
- What's wrong with the sleep pile?
- Oh, come on, Eep! The sleep pile reeks!

46:57.484 --> 46:58.735
Reeks of love!

46:58.819 --> 47:01.822
Well, at least I smell like me.

47:01.905 --> 47:04.032
I don't even know what you smell like.

47:04.116 --> 47:05.701
Flowers and soft rain.

47:05.784 --> 47:07.619
I don't even know who you are anymore!

47:07.703 --> 47:10.747
With your vanilla
and your stupid neck rock!

47:10.831 --> 47:13.542
It's this place. This place is...

47:13.625 --> 47:16.044
Home! This place is home!

47:16.753 --> 47:17.754
"Home"?

47:17.838 --> 47:20.424
This is the place
my parents wanted me to find!

47:20.507 --> 47:22.259
This is Tomorrow.

47:23.010 --> 47:27.472
Well, clearly,
I don't belong in this Tomorrow.

47:29.683 --> 47:31.268
I'm leaving.

47:31.351 --> 47:32.561
Are you coming with me?

47:33.437 --> 47:34.438
I, um...

47:35.397 --> 47:36.523
I can't.

47:40.068 --> 47:42.321
Then I guess we have
two different Tomorrows.

47:49.870 --> 47:50.871
Eep.

47:57.544 --> 48:00.881
So, who's ready for dessert?

48:00.964 --> 48:02.090
I told you,

48:02.174 --> 48:04.635
we're not hungry!

48:04.718 --> 48:06.261
You ate a banana?

48:06.345 --> 48:09.473
Nuh-uh. We ate all the bananas.

48:10.098 --> 48:13.685
That's impossible.

48:13.769 --> 48:15.687
Not for cave people.

48:16.355 --> 48:17.981
What have you done?

48:18.065 --> 48:20.067
They're just bananas, Phil.

48:20.150 --> 48:22.611
"Just bananas"?
"Just bananas," she says!

48:22.694 --> 48:24.321
That was my one rule!

48:25.239 --> 48:26.823
Wait, we're not done.

48:26.907 --> 48:29.201
There was more
I was planning on saying to you!

48:29.952 --> 48:33.205
Mrs. Better-mom,
I'll just take my dessert at the window.

48:33.789 --> 48:36.917
You kidding me?
I've lived with her family for how long?

48:37.000 --> 48:40.087
With the... With the dirt and the smell.

48:40.170 --> 48:44.216
Eep? Eep, is that... you?

48:47.135 --> 48:48.512
I don't know.

48:50.180 --> 48:52.474
- Did you hit him?
- No.

48:52.558 --> 48:53.725
I thought about it.

48:53.809 --> 48:57.104
The bananas were key to our survival.

48:57.187 --> 49:02.609
The bananas were keeping us safe.

49:02.693 --> 49:04.319
Safe from what?

49:08.407 --> 49:09.783
It's here...

49:09.867 --> 49:11.451
for the bananas!

49:11.535 --> 49:12.911
What is, Phil?

49:12.995 --> 49:15.914
It has come every night
for 100 moons or more.

49:18.959 --> 49:22.171
<i>I found bananas are the only thing
that keeps it at bay.</i>

49:27.217 --> 49:28.969
What's on the other side
of the wall, Phil?

49:29.052 --> 49:32.723
<i>Night after night, it was never enough!</i>

49:37.311 --> 49:41.231
It wants its bananas!

49:41.315 --> 49:43.650
What's behind the wall, Phil?

49:44.193 --> 49:45.277
What is it, Phil?

49:47.029 --> 49:49.031
- What are the bananas for?
- What is it?

49:49.114 --> 49:51.700
I don't know!

50:03.086 --> 50:04.087
Huh?

50:06.173 --> 50:07.799
It's just a little punch monkey.

50:07.883 --> 50:10.594
I'm leaving.

50:10.677 --> 50:12.888
You just kept giving it bananas?

50:15.474 --> 50:17.559
Wait, wait. Let me understand something.

50:18.352 --> 50:21.396
You had no idea you were working...

50:22.898 --> 50:24.399
for an itty-bitty monkey?

50:25.067 --> 50:31.615
Giving it bananas for years!

50:42.751 --> 50:43.794
That's not good.

50:46.380 --> 50:48.590
No, no, no! Get away!

50:50.342 --> 50:51.343
Phil!

50:54.388 --> 50:57.182
Come on, come on, come on!

51:04.857 --> 51:08.861
Oh, Douglas, those flowers
did not agree with me.

51:08.944 --> 51:10.779
What'd I miss?

51:12.447 --> 51:15.409
Hey, Mrs. Better-mom,
wasn't there a wall there before?

51:19.204 --> 51:20.205
Phil?

51:20.289 --> 51:22.332
Dad? Guy?

51:22.416 --> 51:23.458
Grug?

51:25.335 --> 51:26.587
It's gone.

51:26.670 --> 51:29.131
The wall is gone. Phil's gone.

51:29.214 --> 51:32.259
Oh, my gosh. Something has taken him,
taken all of them.

51:32.342 --> 51:33.635
What are we gonna do?

51:33.719 --> 51:37.014
No sign of them.
But I did find this though.

51:37.097 --> 51:39.725
- Is that my basket?
- Good eye.

51:39.808 --> 51:42.060
Sandy can track them with this.

51:42.144 --> 51:43.437
Sandy, seek.

51:44.646 --> 51:45.647
Okay, right.

51:45.731 --> 51:48.692
You guys go, and Dawn and I
will stay here and fix the wall.

51:48.775 --> 51:52.029
Or better yet, Dawn, let's get you
back inside your panic cubby.

51:52.112 --> 51:54.781
In fact, I think we can both fit
if we suck it in.

51:54.865 --> 51:57.117
She's got the scent.

51:57.201 --> 51:58.952
Whatever took them
couldn't have gotten far.

51:59.036 --> 52:01.246
Mom,

52:01.830 --> 52:02.831
I'm going too.

52:02.915 --> 52:06.418
Dawn, listen to yourself!
We are not like them.

52:06.502 --> 52:08.003
Dad needs us.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.796
Wait. Dawn!

52:11.840 --> 52:15.219
Dawn, you'll need the travel basket.

52:15.302 --> 52:16.595
It has a neck pillow.

52:17.179 --> 52:18.889
Where are you taking us?

52:18.972 --> 52:20.015
Stop talking!

52:20.599 --> 52:22.559
If you're going to eat us,

52:22.643 --> 52:25.437
you should eat the fat one first.
He ate your bananas.

52:25.521 --> 52:27.231
Oh, don't you blame me for this.

52:27.314 --> 52:29.274
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

52:29.358 --> 52:30.692
Tell him, Guy!

52:30.776 --> 52:33.570
She says I changed.

52:33.654 --> 52:36.365
I didn't change!
This is the real me, baby!

52:36.448 --> 52:38.367
You know? You know what I'm saying?

52:38.450 --> 52:41.495
What you see, that's what you get.
That's what you...

52:41.578 --> 52:43.372
There you are. I lost you for a second.

52:43.455 --> 52:45.332
Anyway, I don't need anybody.
No one at all.

52:45.415 --> 52:49.378
Ow! Fine! Wasn't much
of a conversation anyway.

52:49.461 --> 52:52.506
Guess it's just me with my thoughts.

52:52.589 --> 52:53.841
Travel log.

52:53.924 --> 52:56.343
Literally, I'm traveling in a log.

52:56.426 --> 52:58.470
So, it's been a while. A little update.

52:58.554 --> 53:00.180
<i>Remember that Tomorrow?</i>

53:00.264 --> 53:02.975
<i>You know, the one
I spent my whole life looking for?</i>

53:03.058 --> 53:06.812
<i>Well, turns out, the girl I love
wants nothing to do with it...</i>

53:06.895 --> 53:07.896
<i>or me.</i>

53:07.980 --> 53:10.649
<i>Girls, very, very complicated.</i>

53:10.732 --> 53:13.485
<i>Dear diary. Hey, it's me.</i>

53:13.569 --> 53:15.571
<i>Remember what I said about fate?</i>

53:15.654 --> 53:18.490
<i>Well, fate's dumb and a liar</i>.

53:18.574 --> 53:20.784
<i>Fate thinks it's better than you.</i>

53:20.868 --> 53:22.911
<i>Fate wants to stay with...</i>

53:22.995 --> 53:26.540
<i>The Bettermans! They're amazing.
I mean, have you seen their tree house?</i>

53:26.623 --> 53:29.168
<i>What's so great about living in a tree?</i>

53:29.251 --> 53:31.712
<i>Showers, instant fire,
so much food, and...</i>

53:31.795 --> 53:33.213
<i>"Privacy."</i>

53:33.297 --> 53:34.631
<i>Well, one thing's clear.</i>

53:34.715 --> 53:36.258
- It's over!
- ...over!

53:36.341 --> 53:37.467
- Fine!
- Fine!

53:37.551 --> 53:38.802
- Who cares?
- Not me.

53:45.601 --> 53:48.520
Are you okay?

53:48.604 --> 53:51.273
- Huh?
- It's so bright out here.

53:51.356 --> 53:54.359
I just need to watch the window for a...
I just need to watch it for a minute!

53:56.820 --> 53:58.280
Oh.

53:58.363 --> 54:00.282
Hey, my travel basket!

54:00.365 --> 54:03.076
Travel window.

54:03.160 --> 54:07.080
Ugga, can you tell your son to keep
his grubby hands off my stuff, please?

54:07.164 --> 54:09.875
Listen, I feel really bad
about what happened at dinner

54:09.958 --> 54:12.461
with my parents, and you, and Guy.

54:12.544 --> 54:14.046
Oh.

54:14.129 --> 54:16.965
Please, I'm good. It's in the past!

54:18.342 --> 54:21.178
You know, Guy and I, we're too different.

54:21.261 --> 54:25.849
Well, you and I are different,
and we get along great, right?

54:25.933 --> 54:27.309
Yeah, yeah.

54:27.392 --> 54:29.645
But it's-it's complicated.

54:29.728 --> 54:31.313
He's a boy.

54:31.396 --> 54:34.483
He is... um... stupid.

54:34.566 --> 54:35.817
You know, it's different.

54:35.901 --> 54:38.320
What's the matter? Boy problems?

54:38.403 --> 54:41.740
Well, in my day,
we didn't have boy problems.

54:41.823 --> 54:46.578
Because we didn't have any boys,
or men, or clothes.

54:46.662 --> 54:50.499
We were a warrior tribe of wimmins.

54:50.582 --> 54:53.210
The Thunder Sisters!

54:54.545 --> 54:56.463
What's a Thunder Sister?

54:56.547 --> 54:59.341
Just Gran's old bedtime stories.

54:59.424 --> 55:00.676
True stories!

55:00.759 --> 55:04.137
Okay. Dawn, stop talking
to the crazy lady. Whoa!

55:04.763 --> 55:07.224
We aren't actually
gonna cross that, are we?

55:07.307 --> 55:09.184
Yes. Sandy's tracking the scent.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.645
Well, there's gotta be another way.
You know?

55:11.728 --> 55:16.275
Maybe one that's stable
and not infested with land sharks!

55:16.358 --> 55:17.359
Tell you what,

55:17.442 --> 55:21.071
you be in charge of gift baskets,
and I'll be in charge of tracking the men.

55:21.154 --> 55:22.155
We cross!

55:22.239 --> 55:25.576
Oh, no, no, no. We are not crossing this!

55:25.659 --> 55:27.828
My cat, my rules. We cross!

55:28.412 --> 55:30.497
- Maybe we should take a vote?
- Around!

55:30.581 --> 55:32.749
- Whoa!
- Cross!

55:32.833 --> 55:34.209
Around!

55:34.793 --> 55:36.712
- Cross!
- No!

55:40.465 --> 55:41.633
Sandy, come!

55:44.011 --> 55:47.347
Thank you, Hope. This is so much safer.

55:50.142 --> 55:51.602
I can't see!

55:51.685 --> 55:52.978
What's happening?

55:53.061 --> 55:54.730
Where are they taking us?

55:54.813 --> 55:57.357
Hold tight, Guy.
As soon as we get out of this log,

55:57.441 --> 56:00.360
I'll start swinging and punching
our way to freedom.

56:05.908 --> 56:09.536
Come on, punch monkeys! Let's get this on!

56:17.211 --> 56:19.671
It's-It's not just punch monkeys.

56:19.755 --> 56:20.923
It's kick monkeys,

56:21.006 --> 56:23.550
headbutt monkeys, low-blow monkeys,

56:23.634 --> 56:25.594
bite monkeys, ab-tight monkeys!

56:25.677 --> 56:28.138
Shoulders that punch! Tails that crunch!

56:28.222 --> 56:31.350
Deranged stranglers! Strange danglers!
Fanged manglers!

56:31.433 --> 56:33.685
Mouth-breathers! Brain squeezers!

56:33.769 --> 56:35.479
And a dude with...

56:36.104 --> 56:37.147
weird eyes.

56:38.649 --> 56:39.733
Mmm.

56:55.666 --> 56:57.084
Hmm.

56:57.167 --> 57:00.337
They seem to have
some kind of primitive language.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.673
But you can't speak it,
huh, smarty-pants?

57:02.756 --> 57:06.051
Well, no. But I'm sure
after a few months in captivity...

57:06.134 --> 57:09.179
I can talk to them.
I'm fluent in punch monkey.

57:09.263 --> 57:10.931
- You are?
- Impossible.

57:11.014 --> 57:13.892
Oh, I really don't want to do this.
It's not a pretty language.

57:15.769 --> 57:18.689
Pardon me, I'd like to ask...

57:20.941 --> 57:22.484
Hmm.

57:23.193 --> 57:24.570
Uh-huh.

57:24.653 --> 57:26.446
- Ooh! I see.
- So, what's he saying?

57:27.281 --> 57:31.326
They're angry because
Phil broke the terms of their contract!

57:31.410 --> 57:34.454
Ludicrous! We had no formal agreement,
you chiselers!

57:34.538 --> 57:37.249
Oh! Also, they want their bananas.

57:37.332 --> 57:41.420
Yeah, bananas are delicious.
Why is that our problem?

57:41.503 --> 57:43.505
And one more question.

57:48.010 --> 57:51.388
Many moons ago,
their world was a paradise.

57:51.471 --> 57:53.348
This is gonna be a long story.

57:53.849 --> 57:56.226
<i>"It was a time of much joy.</i>

57:56.310 --> 57:58.395
<i>The water flowed freely.</i>

57:58.478 --> 58:00.731
<i>The bananas grew in bunches.</i>

58:00.814 --> 58:03.483
<i>We had art, politics...</i>

58:03.567 --> 58:05.611
- <i>...economics...</i>
- Ooh.

58:05.694 --> 58:07.696
<i>...but most of all, bananas.</i>

58:07.779 --> 58:09.990
<i>So many bananas.</i>

58:10.073 --> 58:11.950
<i>Then, at full moon,</i>

58:12.034 --> 58:14.119
<i>the monster came for its bananas.</i>

58:14.912 --> 58:16.705
<i>Yep. Good times."</i>

58:16.788 --> 58:19.499
- Wait. Um, go back.
- Yeah. Did he say "monster"?

58:19.583 --> 58:22.169
We are not going back!
As I was saying...

58:22.252 --> 58:23.587
<i>"Good times.</i>

58:23.670 --> 58:27.925
<i>But then, for some strange reason,
the water went away.</i>

58:28.008 --> 58:31.053
<i>After that, the bananas went away too.</i>

58:31.136 --> 58:33.597
<i>But the monster didn't go away. No.</i>

58:33.680 --> 58:36.600
<i>It came back for its bananas.</i>

58:36.683 --> 58:38.185
<i>There were no bananas."</i>

58:44.983 --> 58:48.445
In summary,
they really need those bananas.

58:49.029 --> 58:50.864
Monsters, bananas.

58:50.948 --> 58:55.118
I'll tell you what their problem is.
Their water supply is dried up.

58:55.202 --> 58:57.120
Tell them this word-for-word, Guy.

58:57.204 --> 59:01.166
I, Phil Betterman, single-handedly
turned a desert into an oasis

59:01.250 --> 59:04.002
by diverting water
from a high mountain source,

59:04.086 --> 59:06.547
much like that... one.

59:06.630 --> 59:08.048
Wait, Guy, don't translate that.

59:11.176 --> 59:13.595
Too late.

59:15.180 --> 59:16.515
It was all him!

59:16.598 --> 59:19.685
He stole your water, ate your bananas
and ruined your society!

59:21.061 --> 59:24.106
That's it! I will not be pelted!

59:25.315 --> 59:27.818
Now, impertinent apes...

59:27.901 --> 59:30.529
...meet the full force of my intellect.

59:30.612 --> 59:35.033
Look upon Betterman the toolmaker
and despair!

59:35.117 --> 59:36.285
Jab, jab.

59:37.703 --> 59:39.204
Ooh!

59:46.587 --> 59:47.754
Jab, jab, jab.

59:47.838 --> 59:49.423
Way to go, Phil.

59:50.632 --> 59:53.468
Way to go, Hope. We lost the scent.

59:57.097 --> 59:59.558
No, no, no! Travel window!

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:02.186
Come on, come on. Whoo!

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.770
It still works, everybody!

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:06.732
We are lost.

01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:10.360
This is why you don't follow cave people.
One more word out of...

01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:13.906
We have forgotten the old ways,

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:17.826
the ways of the world when it was young,
and I was young,

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:24.917
when I was the queen matriarch
of a warrior tribe of wimmins.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.543
The Thunder Sisters.

01:00:26.627 --> 01:00:29.880
You got it, girl.
The Thunder Sisters.

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:33.550
We faced down danger
and kicked death in the crotch!

01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:38.013
We don't need the Thunder Sisters, Mom.
We need a way to find the men!

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.932
Oh, a way?

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:43.143
The Thunder Sisters always find a way!

01:00:43.227 --> 01:00:45.479
Think you got one more flight
in you, old girl?

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.775
Oh, my goodness.

01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:54.821
Fly, Wigasus, fly!

01:00:54.905 --> 01:00:56.448
Go.

01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:58.325
Go and find them, Wigasus.

01:01:00.077 --> 01:01:01.578
That is it!

01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:03.747
You are all crazy!

01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:06.542
And you know what?
That hair's not coming back. It escaped.

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.544
Which is what we need to be doing,
Dawn.

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:11.547
Getting away from these crazy...
cave people!

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:12.631
Mom!

01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:15.050
You came barging
into our lives uninvited,

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:18.428
without even wiping
your disgusting... feet!

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:23.308
And peeping Thunk over here,
with his dumb... window.

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:25.060
This show is for older kids.

01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:27.479
And that flea-infested rat baby!

01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:29.231
- Mmm?
- You dumb baby.

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:30.816
Okay. I'm gonna kill her.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.609
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:34.069
And you!

01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:38.031
Taking my daughter outside the wall,
giving her scars and stupid ideas!

01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:40.284
Mom!
Don't talk to my friend that way.

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.994
And I'm glad Guy came to his senses

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:44.204
and realized he doesn't belong
with a cave girl.

01:01:44.288 --> 01:01:46.540
He belongs with us,
the Bettermans!

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:48.083
Let's go, Dawn!

01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:49.960
Mom, where are you going?

01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:52.212
Got to get away!

01:01:53.297 --> 01:01:54.548
Cave people!

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:03.015
Oh, no.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.186
What is that?

01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:17.529
Eep!

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:22.201
Get him, Eep! Get him!

01:02:23.285 --> 01:02:24.870
- Mom!
- There she is!

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.999
We're coming for you, ice lady!

01:02:40.135 --> 01:02:42.304
Kill circle!

01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:45.474
Come on, stabby. Time to get stabbing.

01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:53.440
Guys, wait a minute.

01:02:53.524 --> 01:02:55.317
Everyone lower your weapons.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.819
Dawn. What is she doing?

01:02:57.903 --> 01:02:59.488
Trust her. Lower your weapons.

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:05.327
Come here, little guy.
You can come out.

01:03:06.828 --> 01:03:08.956
Yeah. It's okay. You got it.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.710
This isn't a monster.

01:03:13.794 --> 01:03:15.003
It's a mom

01:03:15.087 --> 01:03:19.424
who was just afraid for her baby
and being protective,

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:22.177
and maybe a bit, uh, rude.

01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:26.181
And maybe she just didn't realize

01:03:26.265 --> 01:03:30.352
that the outsiders weren't a threat
but actually...

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:31.812
friends.

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:33.397
And that maybe,

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.150
the wolf spiders and outsiders
could live in beautiful harmony together

01:03:37.234 --> 01:03:39.361
in their tree house!

01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:40.779
I mean ice cave.

01:03:41.822 --> 01:03:42.823
Whoa.

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:46.368
You got all that
just from looking at them?

01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:51.290
Perhaps the window
by which I view the world is flawed.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.459
I'm gonna go pet them.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.963
Oh, look,
they're hugging me with their teeth!

01:03:58.046 --> 01:03:59.214
Ow!

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:12.186
- Guy.
- Eep?

01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:14.563
- Guy.
- Eep, you came back!

01:04:14.646 --> 01:04:15.856
No.

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:18.066
You made your choice.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:21.820
- No. That's not what I wanted!
- Enjoy your... Tomorrow!

01:04:21.904 --> 01:04:23.697
Eep! Come back!

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.781
No!

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:39.922
Grug, do you mind?
I'm trying to think!

01:04:40.005 --> 01:04:44.510
Well, I'm trying to get out of here
before that monster shows up!

01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:48.263
There's no monster,
you bonehead.

01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:51.058
They just want to... scare us.

01:04:51.141 --> 01:04:52.142
That's it!

01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:55.771
Time to strike fear
into the hearts of these apes.

01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:07.616
Look upon Betterman the fire maker
and despair!

01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:08.700
Flame, flame!

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:14.665
Great. Now they have spears and fire.

01:05:14.748 --> 01:05:17.167
Guy, he just gave the monkeys fire!

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:33.100
You ready? And shake.

01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:34.685
Oh. And shake!

01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:38.856
And shake, and shake, and shake,
and shake, and shake!

01:05:38.939 --> 01:05:41.650
Hey, Gran?
Are you sure this is safe?

01:05:41.733 --> 01:05:44.820
Don't worry. It won't hurt... much.

01:05:44.903 --> 01:05:48.323
- Where's Eep?
- She went off to get more firewood.

01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:50.826
- I'm gonna go find her.
- Ugga, help me.

01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:52.494
Shh.

01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:53.912
Eep?

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:55.873
Eep?

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:12.306
Oh, hey!

01:06:12.389 --> 01:06:13.432
I'm just...

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.684
I'm just getting some firewood.

01:06:18.604 --> 01:06:20.606
I think you've got it covered.

01:06:20.689 --> 01:06:24.109
Do you wanna take a break
from beating up the forest?

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:32.951
Are you ready to talk about it?

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:43.795
I can't believe
he would choose a tree over me.

01:06:43.879 --> 01:06:46.256
I don't think it's that simple.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.760
Guy knew the Bettermans
when he was little.

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:52.679
They're the closest thing
he has to a family.

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:57.601
Every time I've been hurt before...

01:06:58.727 --> 01:07:02.147
I've gotten a mark I can see.

01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.567
This hurts so much,

01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:07.736
and I can't even see it.

01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:09.530
I can see it.

01:07:10.489 --> 01:07:13.033
Doesn't matter.

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:14.910
We're just too different.

01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:17.204
I don't even care.

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:21.583
Eep, if something hurts this much,

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:23.710
maybe it means you do care.

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:27.840
Maybe it's something worth fighting for.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:32.344
So, what are you gonna do about it?

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:43.522
Mom, you sure you don't wanna join us?
It's really warm in here.

01:07:43.605 --> 01:07:46.066
Uh, I'm not really a sleep-pile person.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:50.404
I have a shawl to keep me... warm.
That's okay.

01:07:50.487 --> 01:07:53.907
I'll just use the travel basket
to shield mys...

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:55.868
Aw, come on!

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:06.879
It's cozy, isn't it?

01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:09.047
- Mmm.
- Told ya.

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:16.054
Hey, um, Ugga?

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:18.223
- Eep?
- Hmm?

01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:19.850
Hi.

01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:22.019
I just wanna say, um...

01:08:23.312 --> 01:08:25.647
that I have been terrible.

01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:32.029
After everything I did and said,
you still saved me.

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:33.113
Why?

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:36.533
Well, we always say
the pack stays together.

01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:38.285
Unofficial motto.

01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:39.703
It's okay.

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:45.000
- No. It is not okay. I was awful.
- It's fine.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.002
- I tried to steal Guy from you.
- It's okay.

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:50.255
And I gave you
a passive-aggressive basket.

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:51.381
Yeah, that was weird.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.008
Who does that?

01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:58.180
And your daughter, obviously,
is not a rat baby.

01:08:58.263 --> 01:08:59.555
She's beautiful.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.894
She is a beautiful human baby.

01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:05.520
- And...
- Enough!

01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:16.698
Where's Guy?

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.243
I think I'm his new pet.

01:09:20.327 --> 01:09:22.621
Oh, that's rough.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.125
What's he saying, Guy?

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:29.877
The aged wise one has decreed,

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:32.631
because we have no bananas
for the monster,

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:35.216
you will be...

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.719
I think I can translate from here, Guy.

01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:43.140
They're saying the oafish caveman
will grow bananas for them,

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:46.270
watering the fields with his bitter tears.

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:50.314
Oh. And naturally,
they want me to supervise.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:51.399
Not what they said.

01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:53.193
You can't speak punch monkey.

01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:54.570
Can I not?

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:59.783
{\an8}Monkeys, I have mastered your zesty
and expressive language.

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:00.909
{\an8}No, you haven't.

01:10:00.993 --> 01:10:06.039
{\an8}Let me talk a little punch monkey.
Phil Betterman is so smart, he's stupid!

01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:09.209
{\an8}Oh, what do you have to say
to this witty rejoinder?

01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:13.172
{\an8}You know what? Let me fix this.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:15.591
Do you mind? Can I take this? Thanks.

01:10:15.674 --> 01:10:17.676
- Do not interrupt me!
- You stop interrupting me!

01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:20.262
Will you two stop it?
I'm trying to get us out of this!

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:22.973
I'm in good with these monkeys.
I have a job!

01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:24.892
And you two, you're gonna mess it up!

01:10:24.975 --> 01:10:26.268
Like you mess up everything!

01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:30.189
Like you messed up
my beautiful teenage romance.

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:37.738
Guy, son, please understand.

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:39.656
It's Grug's fault.

01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:42.784
Huh?

01:10:42.868 --> 01:10:45.245
- Get him, Guy!
- I am not on your side!

01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:47.122
- Yeah, he's with me!
- I'm not on yours either!

01:10:48.957 --> 01:10:50.209
Oh.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.421
I recognize those broad shoulders.

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:57.049
Oh, Eep, you came for me. Boop.

01:10:57.132 --> 01:10:58.800
Ah!

01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:08.060
Mmm.

01:11:09.394 --> 01:11:11.021
What are you doing?

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.524
Where you going, Phil?

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:18.153
No man cave here.

01:11:18.237 --> 01:11:21.657
You can hide from your family...

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.286
...but you can't hide from me.

01:11:28.163 --> 01:11:31.041
Well, your precious pack...

01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:33.836
is glad you're gone...

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:36.505
because you smother them.

01:11:37.548 --> 01:11:41.260
Oh!
Well, you built a wall around your family.

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:43.470
But you also built a wall

01:11:43.554 --> 01:11:46.431
around your heart.

01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:47.683
Oh!

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:49.476
You know what you are?

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.061
I'll tell you what you are.

01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.479
- You're...
- A bad...

01:11:52.563 --> 01:11:53.689
Father!

01:12:00.445 --> 01:12:02.739
Words as weapons?

01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:04.283
You're just a cave girl.

01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:06.368
It's called a shower. Try it.

01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:09.079
I told her to take a shower.
Who does that?

01:12:09.162 --> 01:12:10.497
You did.

01:12:11.206 --> 01:12:12.332
Oh, Eep.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.169
Congratulations, Phil.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:17.588
You hit me where it hurts.

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:20.299
Likewise.

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:22.301
Hey, Phil! Hey!

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:23.677
Hello, Grug!

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.513
Grug, am I hallucinating?

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:30.392
No. Guy's a giant banana.

01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:32.561
What the monkeys were trying to say

01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:36.523
was that we're gonna be sacrificed
to the monster at full moon tonight.

01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:46.617
She's still waiting out there.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.661
I'm not sure her hair
is coming back.

01:12:58.587 --> 01:13:02.257
Ooh.
How long was I out for?

01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:05.677
What are you guys all staring at?

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:13.227
Mom!

01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:17.523
Your hair! It's massive and wild,
and I love it.

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.607
Thanks.

01:13:19.316 --> 01:13:21.568
Gran, your hair!

01:13:21.652 --> 01:13:23.570
What? It's temporary.

01:13:23.654 --> 01:13:26.490
No! It's flying this way!

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:34.665
Wigasus has returned!

01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:35.874
Get off me.

01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:40.963
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:42.339
Get to the point.

01:13:42.422 --> 01:13:46.009
Punch monkeys. I hate punch monkeys.

01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:50.472
Wigasus says the men
have been taken over yonder.

01:13:52.224 --> 01:13:54.226
Great. What's the plan?

01:13:54.309 --> 01:13:57.104
What would the Thunder Sisters do?

01:13:57.187 --> 01:14:00.274
Aw. All right, Thunder Sisters!

01:14:00.357 --> 01:14:04.611
If we're gonna rescue these men,
there's something we're gonna need.

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:05.821
- A window?
- No.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.239
- A catchy chant?
- No!

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.991
Each other.

01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:10.450
"Each" what? No!

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.328
New tribe names.

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:16.081
Sandy, you shall be called "Seeker."

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:17.833
Eep, "Fire Heart."

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.585
Ugga, "Blood Horn."

01:14:19.668 --> 01:14:21.086
Thunk, you're...

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:22.254
"Thunk."

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.423
Smart girl whose name I don't remember.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:25.591
- I'm Dawn.
- No!

01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:27.634
You are "Sister Sunset."

01:14:27.718 --> 01:14:30.429
And you are "Bog Water."

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.889
My name's "Bog Water"?

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:34.016
I thought of it before you had cool hair.

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:38.020
I am Bog Water!

01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:40.981
- Hey, Sister Sunset.
- Yeah, Fire Heart?

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:43.108
- You see those wolf spiders?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.192 --> 01:14:44.776
- Wanna ride them?
- Yeah!

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.987
- Thunder Sisters.
- Thunder Sisters!

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:49.448
- Thunder Sisters!
- Thunder Sister!

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.747
Thunder Sisters!

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:27.528
Oh, it went in my mouth.

01:15:45.838 --> 01:15:47.214
Well,

01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:49.049
I guess this is it.

01:15:49.842 --> 01:15:53.178
Phil, I'm sorry I ate your bananas.

01:15:54.263 --> 01:15:58.016
I suppose perhaps
I have made mistakes too.

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:02.437
- Like weaponizing these monkeys?
- Well, yeah.

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:03.772
Or stealing their water?

01:16:03.856 --> 01:16:05.023
Mmm.

01:16:05.107 --> 01:16:06.859
And teaching them to tie these knots?

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:08.777
Well, their knots were atrocious!

01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:16.410
I just wish that I'd been able
to see Eep one more time.

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:21.623
I spent my whole life searching
for a place my parents wanted me to find,

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:23.917
and I found it.

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:27.337
But now, all I can think about is Eep.

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.548
My best friend...

01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:33.385
my first and only love.

01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:37.764
You know, your parents
loved you very much.

01:16:37.848 --> 01:16:40.309
I think all they wanted for you was to...

01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:42.477
find happiness.

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.273
And if there's one thing I know,

01:16:46.356 --> 01:16:49.860
it's that you and Eep
make each other happy.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.321
Guy,

01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:57.159
there's no one I'd rather my daughter
spend her Tomorrow with than you.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:02.331
Guy, I too give you permission
to start a home with Grug's daughter.

01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:04.833
- That's not how it works.
- But it is appreciated.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:07.753
And you two twits are the closest thing
I have to fathers.

01:17:07.836 --> 01:17:08.837
Thanks, son.

01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:11.131
We're not so different after all, Grug.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:15.594
We're two profoundly foolish fathers
obsessed with bananas...

01:17:17.221 --> 01:17:20.432
...about to die
an incredibly ironic death.

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:28.941
Grug! What's going on?

01:17:29.816 --> 01:17:31.777
I don't know! I can't see!

01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:42.412
Ah!

01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:44.581
I can't look. What is it?

01:17:44.665 --> 01:17:46.250
It's... It's...

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.417
It's...

01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:51.338
actually kind of cute.

01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:56.635
That's just its forehead? Oh, come on!
