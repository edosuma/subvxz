00:16.517 --> 00:18.382
At the Tenkaichi Budokai grounds,

00:18.602 --> 00:22.094
Vegeta wreaks the worst sort of destruction.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.932
Vegeta, don't tell me...

00:26.151 --> 00:30.019
Don't tell me you intentionally
submitted to Babidi's spell...

00:40.165 --> 00:43.453
If I hadn't done this,
you wouldn't have fought me.

00:44.461 --> 00:48.170
Babidi! Change us to someplace
where there ain't nobody around!

00:48.382 --> 00:51.169
I've decided to fight Vegeta!

00:51.385 --> 00:53.421
Just a moment!

00:53.637 --> 00:55.844
If you insist on having your showdown,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.798
you will have to go through me first!

00:59.017 --> 01:03.351
As Goku at last resolves to fight Vegeta,

01:03.564 --> 01:07.853
he turns aside even Kaioshin
when he steps in to stop him.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.031
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.825
I've been waiting for this moment...

01:19.037 --> 01:21.574
for so very long!

01:21.790 --> 01:23.872
I don't want the damage I take from you

01:24.084 --> 01:26.245
to end up as energy for Majin Boo.

01:26.462 --> 01:29.750
I'm gonna give you my highest power,
so we can end this quickly.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.423
Let's go! I'll kill you, Kakarrot!

03:05.143 --> 03:11.855
"Countdown to Revival--
Dash Babidi's Dreams!"

03:28.250 --> 03:29.706
Th-Th-They're here!

03:29.918 --> 03:31.533
Y-You won't get past us!

03:31.753 --> 03:34.415
The warriors that serve under Babidi?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.589
We do not have time to waste
on these small fry. Let's hurry on!

03:37.801 --> 03:39.792
--Right!
--Hey, let's get them!

03:40.012 --> 03:41.502
Yeah!

04:02.451 --> 04:04.988
Whew! As good as ever.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.122
He sure is self-assured, isn't he?

04:15.339 --> 04:18.456
He is saying that there is no need
to buy any more time, is he?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.337
Let's go. On to where Majin Boo's ball is.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.054
Right.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.324
What's the matter? I thought you
were going to settle this quickly!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.044
Oh, I will.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.402
K-Kakarrot!

06:00.819 --> 06:02.684
Good, good, Vegeta!

06:02.904 --> 06:04.519
Keep it up!

06:14.166 --> 06:15.281
Look! Look!

06:15.500 --> 06:20.210
Majin Boo's energy is
quickly, quickly building up!

06:25.802 --> 06:30.796
All that's left is the question of
how to deal with them, huh, Dabra?

06:31.016 --> 06:32.256
Yes, indeed.

06:32.476 --> 06:36.640
You are about to see the death of Kaioshin,
right before your eyes.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.723
I'll leave it to you, Dabra.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.552
You won't best me!
You won't best me, Kakarrot!

08:32.386 --> 08:34.844
Is that Majin Boo's ball?

08:35.056 --> 08:37.047
Yes. The terrible Majin Boo,

08:37.267 --> 08:41.135
created by the evil Madoshi Bibidi,
is inside there.

08:44.900 --> 08:49.610
Incredible. Such an enormous, evil Ki,
unlike anything I have ever felt before.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.652
That is correct!

08:54.367 --> 08:56.232
| welcome you here.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.404
I'm glad you made it, Kaioshin.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.366
I am here to defeat you, Babidi!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.992
Bane of my papa!

09:06.213 --> 09:09.205
And I will also prevent the return of Majin Boo!

09:09.424 --> 09:13.713
Unfortunately, I don't think
you will be so lucky.

09:13.929 --> 09:17.342
l have the demon king Dabra here with me.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.972
Let's hurry, Gohan-san!
While we are down here,

09:23.188 --> 09:25.645
it's possible that the
damage energy from Goku-san

09:25.857 --> 09:27.393
is being delivered to Majin Boo.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.439
Right!

09:28.652 --> 09:31.064
I will fight Babidi!

09:49.339 --> 09:54.504
What force! Vegeta has
increased his power a lot.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.806
Vegeta!

10:23.540 --> 10:26.782
What's wrong? Weren't you
going to end this quickly?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.459
That's what I'm trying to do.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.878
Hmph, and you end up like this?

10:33.967 --> 10:38.506
Even so, the humiliation I took
from you went way beyond this!

10:46.313 --> 10:49.851
Not yet! This still isn't nearly enough!

11:37.322 --> 11:40.280
l, the proud Saiyan prince,

11:40.492 --> 11:45.907
was taken pity upon...
and had my life spared...

11:46.122 --> 11:49.535
...by the likes of a lower-class warrior like you!

11:51.628 --> 11:55.962
The sentence is death!
I'm going to cut you to pieces!

11:56.174 --> 11:57.880
Starting with your arms!

12:09.646 --> 12:11.136
What?!

12:49.352 --> 12:50.853
Where are you?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.936
Here, Kakarrot!

13:15.712 --> 13:16.997
Kamehame.. .!

13:17.213 --> 13:18.749
Take this!

14:45.301 --> 14:48.759
Gohan-san, no matter what it takes,
we have to take care of those two

14:48.972 --> 14:51.714
before Majin Boo's ball
can store up enough energy.

14:51.933 --> 14:57.178
lf Majin Boo is revived,
the Earth will be wiped out in no time.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.728
Right!

14:58.940 --> 15:00.805
Kaioshin!

15:01.025 --> 15:02.936
Why don't we head to ground level?

15:03.152 --> 15:06.565
Majin Boo will be emerging
from his ball at any time now,

15:06.781 --> 15:09.898
after reaching his full power.
When that happens,

15:10.118 --> 15:14.452
it won't do me any good to have my ship
destroyed by any over-impulsive actions.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.282
Very well. But no matter what it takes,
we will defeat you,

15:18.501 --> 15:21.117
and prevent Majin Boo from being revived!

15:22.130 --> 15:24.746
Are you sure it will work out that well?

15:27.885 --> 15:30.297
Papparapa!!

15:43.276 --> 15:46.564
Well, Dabra? I should
check with you, just in case,

15:46.779 --> 15:49.691
but you are confident that you
can beat the earthling, right?

15:49.907 --> 15:53.650
Of course I am. I fought him
a little bit earlier, after all.

15:53.870 --> 15:57.283
Without a doubt, I can put
that piece of trash away.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.830
Do whatever you like with him.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.378
You may turn him to stone, like those guys,

16:05.590 --> 16:07.751
or do something even more extreme to him!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.047
Yes, sir!

16:09.260 --> 16:13.003
Kaioshin, I'm so glad you came here.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.510
At last, I can avenge my father's death.

16:16.726 --> 16:20.514
My papa was done in by you, a long time ago.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.846
I'm sure he must have let his guard down.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.729
But unlike my papa, I will not
be killed by the likes of you!

16:26.944 --> 16:30.778
My magical powers are
much greater than my papa's,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.527
and l have Dabra here with me, as well!

16:46.547 --> 16:49.459
Th-There's no clear shot.
If I attack him blindly,

16:49.676 --> 16:51.883
l'll fall prey to his magic...

16:55.139 --> 16:58.097
Shoot! How could I have so
much trouble with that guy?

16:58.309 --> 17:02.598
While we're standing around like this,
Majin Boo's energy is building up in a hurry!

17:02.814 --> 17:03.803
Get mad!

17:04.022 --> 17:05.729
Get mad, Gohan!

17:05.942 --> 17:07.227
Father!

17:07.443 --> 17:10.651
Get mad and recall your fight with Cell,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.569
and draw out all the power you have.

17:13.782 --> 17:18.367
Do that, and there ain't no one in
the whole world that can beat you.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.535
There ain't no one.

17:22.083 --> 17:26.291
|-| am mad! I am mad, but getting
to how I was back then...

17:26.503 --> 17:28.916
Getting to howl was during the Cell battle...

17:31.217 --> 17:38.589
Ka... me... ha... me...

17:38.808 --> 17:41.675
...Ha!!

17:41.894 --> 17:44.146
W-What?!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.459
D-Damn it...!

18:15.428 --> 18:17.635
Nothing left now but to do this!

18:55.468 --> 18:57.333
You've gotten stronger, huh, Kakarrot?

18:57.553 --> 18:58.338
Heh.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.636
Is that what training in
the Next World gets you?

19:00.848 --> 19:05.182
You, too, Vegeta. You're much
stronger than I thought.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.870
l-lt couldn't be...!

19:31.712 --> 19:35.830
It couldn't be! Not that quickly!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.630
W-What is it?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.478
What is the matter, Babidi-sama?

19:58.698 --> 20:02.532
F-Full power! He's reached full power!

20:04.078 --> 20:07.821
Majin Boo has reached his full power!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.873
He's reached full power!

20:13.963 --> 20:17.751
At last, Majin Boo will be revived!

20:23.556 --> 20:24.636
l-lmpossible!

20:24.849 --> 20:29.309
H-How can the damage energy
from Goku-san fill up so soon?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.974
Th-That's why!

20:33.190 --> 20:37.900
Father is fighting at the level
beyond even Super Saiyan!

20:38.112 --> 20:39.773
Vegeta-san probably is, as well.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.196
When two powers as
incredible as theirs collide,

20:42.408 --> 20:43.944
the damage they do will
also be out-of-this-world!

20:44.160 --> 20:44.945
Blast it!

20:45.161 --> 20:47.948
We did it, Dabra!

20:48.164 --> 20:50.075
Yes, Babidi-sama.

20:51.375 --> 20:55.914
H-How can this be?! How can the
worst-case scenario come true?!

20:56.130 --> 20:58.621
I completely misjudged this!

21:14.565 --> 21:18.774
At last, Majin Boo is coming forth!

21:18.986 --> 21:24.356
But what will be the outcome
of Goku and Vegeta's fight?

21:24.575 --> 21:31.162
Hurry, Goku! Something unheard-of
is happening to Earth!

22:42.028 --> 22:43.609
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.821 --> 22:46.858
This ain't good!
Vegeta's strength is out of sight!

22:47.074 --> 22:48.530
What's worse, thanks to our fighting,

22:48.743 --> 22:51.325
Ma'in Boo's ener reserves are all full u !
J

22:51.537 --> 22:53.903
This is the worst!
I completely misjudged things!

22:54.123 --> 22:56.409
Majin Boo is going to be revived!

22:56.625 --> 22:58.286
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.502 --> 23:01.744
"The Seal is Released?!
Gohan's Kamehame-Ha of Resistance."

23:01.964 --> 23:05.252
Rats, isn't there anything we can do now?
