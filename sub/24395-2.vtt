You do what I say, you won't get hurt.

09:57.843 --> 09:59.809
Yeah, my guess is whatever
you did to trigger the lockdown

09:59.811 --> 10:01.344
disabled this.

If they can't hear us,
I can't negotiate, obviously.

achieve by killing hostages...

this to a capital crime.

to walk the streets.

18:31.968 --> 18:33.968

18:36.773 --> 18:38.940
34 months. Released 16 days ago.

18:38.942 --> 18:40.807
It was a hefty penalty for no charges.

18:40.809 --> 18:44.245

jeopardized other investigations.

18:44.247 --> 18:46.214

are we talking about?

20:53.810 --> 20:56.711
- He just executed a hostage.
- We don't have confirmation of that.

We need to end this. Captain,
do you have eyes on him?

- Look, you got ten hostages in there,

21:03.787 --> 21:06.254
including two of
the closest people in my life.

21:06.256 --> 21:07.655

21:07.657 --> 21:09.157

21:09.159 --> 21:11.226
I know he can get him negotiating.

is not the way to go.

He didn't shoot her.

21:39.723 --> 21:41.389
That's a good sign.

No, she got sick.

He's... taking down the tiles.

He's figured out a way
into the safe room?

Anything to do with Jordan Jones

26:06.385 --> 26:08.919
But four years ago, Jones was assigned

to a special task force,

26:10.422 --> 26:11.755
multiple agencies involved.

26:11.757 --> 26:12.989
Here's the kicker,

26:12.991 --> 26:14.958
Harris was hired as a consultant

26:14.960 --> 26:17.160
and Agent Hall ran it.

26:17.162 --> 26:19.396
So Harris knows Jordan.

26:19.398 --> 26:22.232
And Hall. You'd think
she might've offered that up.

26:22.234 --> 26:24.768
That's why Hall let Roberts
handle negotiations.

26:24.770 --> 26:26.803
Jordan would recognize her.

offshore entities.

26:38.016 --> 26:40.584
Jordan was bluffing.
But he cut off the air supply

26:43.422 --> 26:45.288
the blast radius of the C-4 he's wearing.

26:45.290 --> 26:47.257
We have a shot from the neighboring roof

26:47.259 --> 26:48.825
far enough from the hostages

26:48.827 --> 26:50.427
so that collateral damage
would be minimal.

26:50.429 --> 26:52.462
But we need to get Jordan
into that position.

26:52.464 --> 26:53.697
Beaumont could do that.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.333
And what happens to Eric
when it goes off?

26:56.335 --> 26:57.567
Well, my gut tells me

26:57.569 --> 26:59.169
the C-4 isn't even real.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.485
We could be dealing

30:02.487 --> 30:04.254
with a dissociative identity disorder.

30:04.256 --> 30:06.256
The fugue state is a transitional period

30:06.258 --> 30:08.959
between what they used to call
multiple personalities

30:08.961 --> 30:10.327
or alters.

30:10.329 --> 30:11.695
How did he end up with that?

30:11.697 --> 30:13.196
Well, D.I.D. is usually brought on

30:13.198 --> 30:14.864
by some kind of singular trauma:

30:14.866 --> 30:17.267
combat, victim of a violent crime.

30:17.269 --> 30:18.802
Solitary confinement?

30:18.804 --> 30:19.970
Absolutely.

30:19.972 --> 30:22.639
All right, so this spy persona, Mr. Bear,

30:22.641 --> 30:25.608
he's-he's an alter.
And the aggressive one, too?

30:25.610 --> 30:28.611
There could be any number.
When confronted with high stress

30:28.613 --> 30:31.081
or unpredictable situations,
he's more likely to shift

30:31.083 --> 30:33.416
- between them.
- Could that be a way to reach him?

30:33.418 --> 30:34.617
D.I.D. is complex.

30:34.619 --> 30:36.753
The alters emerge to protect a person

30:36.755 --> 30:38.355
from an unbearable situation.

30:38.357 --> 30:40.657
People with it undergo years of therapy.

30:40.659 --> 30:42.203
I got about ten minutes.

30:42.205 --> 30:43.793
Well, you're not gonna fix him,
Eric, but...

30:43.795 --> 30:45.528
if you get him to trust you,

30:45.530 --> 30:47.697
you might find the real Jordan Jones.

30:47.699 --> 30:48.832
The cop.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.266
Get away from the door!

30:51.036 --> 30:52.402
What did you say to her?

30:52.404 --> 30:54.204
I said you're a reasonable man.

30:54.206 --> 30:56.206
You were wrong. There was no breach.

30:56.208 --> 30:57.607
Go and join the others.

30:57.609 --> 30:58.875
Honest mistake.

31:00.049 --> 31:01.177
I'm back.

31:01.179 --> 31:03.279
Are we talking or are we suffocating?

31:03.281 --> 31:04.814
It's not what you think.

31:04.816 --> 31:07.650
All I'm thinking is that
you didn't tell us the truth

31:07.652 --> 31:09.386
and now we're all at risk.

31:11.223 --> 31:12.646
Captain,

31:13.225 --> 31:14.691
you trust Agent Hall?

31:14.693 --> 31:15.992
She seems to be looking
for the quickest way

31:15.994 --> 31:17.694
to take Jordan out.

31:17.696 --> 31:19.996
- She'd be derelict if she wasn't.
- When you tried

31:19.998 --> 31:22.232
to negotiate with Jordan Jones,
your instinct was to

31:22.234 --> 31:24.534
make a connection.
You know how to do this.

31:24.536 --> 31:26.036
Jordan's choice to stop talking.

31:26.038 --> 31:28.004
Our job is to get him to keep talking.

31:28.006 --> 31:29.672
If we go down Agent Hall's path,

31:29.674 --> 31:31.074
this is gonna end in blood.

31:31.076 --> 31:32.246
What do you expect me to do?

31:32.248 --> 31:34.044
Get her relieved. Take over.

We got motion on the target.

31:36.515 --> 31:38.381
Beaumont's moving him into position.

31:38.383 --> 31:39.649
Look, if the explosives are real,

31:39.651 --> 31:41.418
Beaumont should have time to grab him

31:41.420 --> 31:43.219
and prevent detonation.

31:43.221 --> 31:45.121
We got this covered.

31:55.834 --> 31:56.966
What is it, Max?

31:56.968 --> 31:58.234
About five years ago,

31:58.236 --> 32:01.071
there was a DEA task force
called Operation Penelope.

32:01.073 --> 32:02.372
I remember that.

32:02.374 --> 32:03.907
Was a fake front operation

32:03.909 --> 32:06.576
authorized to launder millions
in order to trace

32:06.578 --> 32:08.878
cartel finances,
but it was shut down because

32:08.880 --> 32:10.447
millions went missing.

32:10.449 --> 32:12.782
You think that's what Harris,
Hall, and Jones were working on?

32:12.784 --> 32:15.151
It fits. And get this,

32:15.153 --> 32:17.921
Harris registered
two offshore shell companies

32:17.923 --> 32:20.657
around the same time
the task force went operational.

32:20.659 --> 32:23.193
Both held seven-figure balances.

32:23.195 --> 32:25.261
One for Harris, one for Hall
would be my guess.

32:25.263 --> 32:27.764
But where does that leave Jordan?

32:27.766 --> 32:29.466
Maybe he tried to be the whistleblower.

Look, Jordan has dissociative

35:48.909 --> 35:50.909
Eric was using the shock
from the sniper's bullet

to provoke Jordan's alter to
switch to the real Jordan Jones,

35:53.747 --> 35:55.347

39:51.151 --> 39:53.251
smear my blood all over the walls,

39:53.253 --> 39:55.585
just to see if I was still alive.

39:56.290 --> 39:57.837
You didn't deserve it.

39:58.292 --> 40:00.425
You didn't. You didn't deserve it.

40:00.427 --> 40:02.260
That's it.

40:03.664 --> 40:05.597
(EXHALES)

40:11.204 --> 40:12.570
Down on your knees! Now!

40:12.572 --> 40:14.572
Get down. Get down.

40:14.574 --> 40:16.105
Hands on your head!

40:16.910 --> 40:18.476
RED TEAM MEMBER: Steady, steady!

40:18.478 --> 40:21.112
Don't touch that! Don't move!

40:21.114 --> 40:23.748
It's not real.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.250
ROBERTS: I said don't move!

40:25.252 --> 40:26.952
It's not a threat.

40:32.693 --> 40:34.893
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)

40:37.698 --> 40:39.965
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

40:39.967 --> 40:41.066
OLIVER: Agent Hall.

40:41.068 --> 40:43.068
You leaving so soon?

40:43.070 --> 40:44.602
Mr. Beaumont.

40:45.468 --> 40:47.539
Everyone got out alive.

40:47.541 --> 40:49.140
I guess I should be impressed.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.605
Oh, not impressed. Maybe just relieved.

40:51.607 --> 40:57.349
Mm. Well, I'm sorry to say, but
you interfered in our op,

40:57.351 --> 40:58.468
elevated the risk.

40:58.470 --> 41:01.419
So, regardless of your good deeds today,

41:01.421 --> 41:03.054
you will have to answer to that.

41:04.024 --> 41:06.891
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:06.893 --> 41:09.561
Captain Roberts already
notified her higher ups

41:09.563 --> 41:12.034
about her dirty little secrets,

41:12.036 --> 41:16.332
SO MY BET: she'll be the one
doing the answering.

41:19.272 --> 41:21.473
Jordan, we'll get you the help you need.

41:21.475 --> 41:23.005
Go easy on him.

41:24.211 --> 41:26.044
Good call.

41:26.046 --> 41:28.046
Using the phone to get him to stand down.

41:28.048 --> 41:31.349
You know, just teeing you up.

41:32.348 --> 41:34.352
Sorry.

41:37.758 --> 41:40.025
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:40.027 --> 41:42.460
- I just needed to call home.
- (PHONE RINGS)

41:44.243 --> 41:46.877
It's, uh, Max.

41:48.769 --> 41:50.835
Hey, Max.

41:50.837 --> 41:52.137
It's over.

41:52.139 --> 41:53.605
Good guys won.

41:53.607 --> 41:54.806
Eric and Zara?

41:54.808 --> 41:56.307
Right as rain.

41:57.477 --> 41:59.344
I kind of missed being there.

41:59.346 --> 42:01.246
Hey, you're the one who wanted
to take a break

42:01.248 --> 42:02.647
from the field after, you know...

42:02.649 --> 42:04.182
MAXINE: I do.

42:04.184 --> 42:08.953
Just, you so rarely
come by the office, so...

42:08.955 --> 42:12.847
Maxine Carlson, are you...?

42:13.660 --> 42:14.959
What?

42:14.961 --> 42:16.127
Oliver!

42:16.129 --> 42:18.663
- OLIVER: Oh, right. Uh...
- What is it?

42:18.665 --> 42:21.099
I almost forgot, I got a dinner date.

42:21.101 --> 42:22.967
Oh, Maisie.

42:22.969 --> 42:24.669
You have a good night, Oliver.

42:24.671 --> 42:26.504
You earned it.

42:26.506 --> 42:29.507
I'll be in Montreal soon, Max.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.598
Could you look any better?
