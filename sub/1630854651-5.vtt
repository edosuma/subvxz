00:14.041 --> 00:15.041
<i> Next up,</i>

00:15.125 --> 00:17.833
<i>back-to-back-to-back episodes</i>
<i>of </i>Married… with Children.

00:17.916 --> 00:20.625
Daniel, get out here! Our show's on.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.166
All right, I'm coming.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.458
Hah! "Coming."

00:23.541 --> 00:25.166
-Have you seen my towel?

00:25.250 --> 00:28.541
All my tops are dirty,
so I wore it to the grocery store.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.375
Just put on some jeans.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.958
Denim is a natural absorbent.

00:33.041 --> 00:37.041
<i>Al, I've been doing some thinking…</i>

00:37.125 --> 00:40.166
<i>Hold on, Peg, let me put my head</i>
<i>in the oven first.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:43.291
This is a great one!

00:43.375 --> 00:44.791
Peg tries to get a job,

00:44.875 --> 00:48.208
but realizes she's a little too stupid
and horny to get it.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.458
<i>For a beautiful new carpet</i>
<i>installed next day…</i>

00:50.541 --> 00:52.208
Yes! Our song!

01:02.208 --> 01:03.166
Banged him.

01:03.250 --> 01:07.125
And yes,
the Empire carpet matches the drapes.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.666
You know what sucks?

01:16.750 --> 01:20.208
When a cheering crowd reminds you
your ex is a professional baseball player

01:20.291 --> 01:22.041
and you live next to Wrigley Field.

01:22.125 --> 01:25.958
I know, Danny, but I support you
and I'm here to listen.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.958
Actually, there is something
I wanted to get off my chest--

01:29.041 --> 01:32.125
-Holy shit! That sounded like a triple!

01:32.208 --> 01:34.041
Sorry, hon, you were saying?

01:34.125 --> 01:35.916
It's probably better
if we don't discuss it.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.583
Copy that. Well, at least we're both
single again and we got each other.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.833
And the good news is,
you only have six more months of baseball.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.500
Eight, if they make the playoffs.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.916
Yeah, that's… great news.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.500
Guys, I'm worried about my best friend.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.333
Who, me? I'm fine.

01:54.416 --> 01:55.666
I'm talking about Daniel.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.416
He got dumped for the first time

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
and I need to do something special
to cheer him up.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.375
Speaking of special things…

02:02.458 --> 02:04.666
Monday night,
we're having a party for Gideon.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.958
It's a surprise, so don't say anything.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.291
I am a goddamn vault.

02:10.375 --> 02:13.083
My friend, John Henderson,
killed a man in '97.

02:13.666 --> 02:14.958
I never told a soul.

02:15.041 --> 02:18.041
So, don't worry,
your surprise is safe with me.

02:18.125 --> 02:19.333
What surprise?

02:19.416 --> 02:23.166
Surprise…
is what we are trying to think of

02:23.250 --> 02:26.166
for Diane to do to cheer up Daniel.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.583
Yes, that's exactly
what we were talking about.

02:29.666 --> 02:31.083
How sad is he?

02:31.166 --> 02:34.083
Are we talking <i>A Dog's Purpose</i>
or <i>A Dog's Journey</i>?

02:34.166 --> 02:36.208
Worse. <i>Marley and Me</i>.

02:36.291 --> 02:37.625
-Oh, dear!
-<i>Jesu Christo!</i>

02:37.708 --> 02:38.791
I don't fuck with dogs.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.958
Well, I recently went
to Broadway Brunch at Roscoe's.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.208
It was delightful.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.083
I sang "Hakuna Matata"
while I ate a frittata!

02:46.166 --> 02:49.833
Oh, that sounds like it sucks,
but Daniel would love it!

02:49.916 --> 02:52.791
-Thanks, Giddy-up.
-I do not consent to that nickname!

02:54.291 --> 02:56.125
Uh…

03:01.583 --> 03:02.583
Hey, honey.

03:02.666 --> 03:06.000
What do you think of "Mariah Whiddington"?

03:06.083 --> 03:08.166
-As a name? It's fine.
-Ugh!

03:08.250 --> 03:10.083
That's not great feedback.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.708
Well, today was something.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.916
Jim Reynolds got stuck in the bathroom.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.583
They had to call the fire department.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.958
-You shoulda seen the look on--
-Uh-huh. Wow.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.541
We should talk boy names too.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.791
You know, I've always liked
the "den" names.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.041
-Aiden, Brayden, Jayden--
-Ooh.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.916
I went to high school with an Aiden.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.458
-His wedgies were brutal.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.041
While you do that, think of some names.
And good ones.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.583
Oh, what about Liam?

03:31.666 --> 03:33.541
I said good ones, Mark.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.750
Hmm.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.416
You excited for your surprise, Daniel?

03:39.500 --> 03:43.583
Yes, but was it really necessary
to cover my eyes while I got dressed?

03:43.666 --> 03:45.708
Also, did you have buffalo wings?

03:45.791 --> 03:48.625
No, I had some wing sauce a few hours ago.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.791
I use it as a mouthwash.
Gives my breath its tang.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.750
Ta-da!

03:54.375 --> 03:56.541
Broadway Brunch at Roscoe's?

03:56.625 --> 03:58.833
We can sing something from <i>Chicago!</i>

03:58.916 --> 04:01.333
Hell yeah! "Saturday in the Park!"

04:01.416 --> 04:03.250
No, the musical.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.250
They made a musical about the band?

04:05.333 --> 04:08.416
-Eat my ass, <i>Jersey Boys!</i>
-Yeah!

04:18.375 --> 04:21.375
Thanks again, Aunt Diane.
This is exactly what I needed.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.583
It's fun, right?

04:22.666 --> 04:25.666
I haven't done karaoke
since your dad's birthday.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.125
I sang "More Than Words"
with his college roommate.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.958
We dry-humped through the chorus.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.750
It wasn't that dry.

04:34.291 --> 04:40.250
I just realized that if I was at college
right now, I'd be studying for finals.

04:40.333 --> 04:43.250
The only school you need is ADU.

04:43.333 --> 04:48.375
Aunt Diane University, where everyone
graduates magna cum loaded!

04:49.875 --> 04:51.458
College sucks!

05:06.375 --> 05:09.083
I'm gonna go pee out
three pitchers of screwdrivers.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.625
I'm gonna cue up <i>Married… with Children.</i>

05:11.708 --> 05:14.541
Wow, it's always on, huh?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.375
"Parking ticket", not gonna pay it.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.291
"Grand jury summons", not guilty.

05:25.375 --> 05:28.833
"Stanford Office of Admissions",
no, thank you.

05:28.916 --> 05:32.041
"Two-for-one Cheddar Bay Biscuits
at Red Lobster"?

05:32.125 --> 05:34.375
Hell yeah--! Ugh!

05:35.583 --> 05:38.750
Mark, we have to get rolling
on these pre-applications

05:38.833 --> 05:40.541
for preschool pre-interviews.

05:40.625 --> 05:43.833
Oh my God, that is so creamy!

05:43.916 --> 05:45.291
Oh, such good head.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.625
-What the hell, Mark?

05:46.708 --> 05:47.708
Who are you talking to?

05:47.791 --> 05:49.208
Uh, nothing! Nobody!

05:50.208 --> 05:52.708
You were doing sex-camera porn!

05:52.791 --> 05:57.166
What, are you paying some woman
to pleasure herself with her own feet?

05:57.250 --> 05:58.583
You sicko!

05:58.666 --> 05:59.833
No, it's Liam.

05:59.916 --> 06:02.166
Oh, so you were porning it up with a man!

06:02.250 --> 06:03.875
My friends were right about you.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.125
-No, he's a master brewer.
-<i>Hello!</i>

06:06.208 --> 06:08.166
I got into brewing my own Belgian beer.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.666
Wait, which friends?

06:09.750 --> 06:10.916
Don't deflect.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.208
Why are you talking about beer
with strangers online?

06:14.291 --> 06:17.250
Because all you do
is talk about baby stuff!

06:17.333 --> 06:19.208
I'm sorry, I just wanted one conversation

06:19.291 --> 06:21.833
where it doesn't revolve
around you getting pregnant.

06:21.916 --> 06:25.666
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry
our baby is so boring, Mark.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.750
What baby?!
There's nothing even in there yet!

06:28.833 --> 06:30.916
Don't call my womb "there!"

06:31.000 --> 06:34.208
And you have the nerve
to suggest Liam as a name.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.833
If you like Belgium so much,
why don't you move there?

06:36.916 --> 06:37.791
That's ridiculous!

06:37.875 --> 06:40.416
Good luck finding a place now,
during the mussel harvest!

06:40.500 --> 06:44.375
You know what? I don't need you.
I can raise this baby alone.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.708
You're not pregnant!

06:47.708 --> 06:51.583
Maybe you should take some time
to think about what you just said!

06:51.666 --> 06:53.208
Ho-ho! Maybe I will!

06:55.333 --> 06:57.541
<i>Excuse me, Mark, still here.</i>

06:58.750 --> 07:01.375
Ugh… I want to die.

07:01.458 --> 07:05.250
I was about to throw a block of cheese
in the microwave. You want one?

07:05.333 --> 07:07.500
Please, stop.
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:07.583 --> 07:11.416
FYI, I used the last of the BK napkins
this morning.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.333
Ugh! I guess I'll use trash again.

07:17.916 --> 07:18.958
What is this?

07:19.041 --> 07:21.583
What you're about to use to wipe your ass.

07:21.666 --> 07:25.666
This is from Stanford Admissions,
asking if I'm coming back.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.958
Did you just… throw this away?

07:28.041 --> 07:31.083
Yeah. Just yesterday,
you said college sucked.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.166
I never said that!

07:32.250 --> 07:34.666
Were you actually thinking
of going to Stanford?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.958
I don't know, but that's for me to decide!

07:38.041 --> 07:41.583
Looks like someone woke up
on the wrong side of the waterbed.

07:41.666 --> 07:44.500
You need to lay down
and I'll bring you some hot cheese.

07:44.583 --> 07:48.250
Please, stop telling me what I need
or what you think is good for me!

07:48.333 --> 07:52.750
Oh, sorry for always making sure
your life is awesome.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.416
You meddling in my life
has not made it awesome.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.708
First, with my relationship with Jason.
Now, literally throwing away my future!

07:59.791 --> 08:02.750
Oh, stop. I didn't meddle
with you and Jason.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.958
Kid couldn't hit a breaking ball
and his OBP was in the gutter.

08:06.041 --> 08:09.875
Stop throwing baseball terms at me,
you Bette Meddler!

08:09.958 --> 08:12.791
That's a good burn,
but you're being a little asshole.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.291
Your life is such a mess
it's making my life a mess!

08:15.375 --> 08:18.291
You know, if you don't like it here,
there's the door!

08:18.375 --> 08:19.500
That is the closet!

08:19.583 --> 08:22.291
So, maybe I've had a little a.m. wine.

08:22.375 --> 08:26.458
You know what? I'm out.
Anywhere is better than here with you!

08:35.583 --> 08:36.625
Hi, Mom. I was hoping--

08:36.708 --> 08:38.916
-Your father is cheating on me!
-What?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.250
Well, not really. I'll explain.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.291
I knew you'd come running back to--

08:47.375 --> 08:48.291
Mark?

08:48.375 --> 08:50.125
-Hey there.
-Are you lost?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.541
The Eddie Bauer outlet's in Skokie.

08:52.625 --> 08:55.666
Actually, it's in Schaumburg.
And I own this place, Diane.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.125
Only legally.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.458
Well, I need to crash here.

08:58.541 --> 09:01.000
Bonnie and I got in this huge fight,
she kicked me out.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.750
I don't wanna get into the details.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.458
-I also don't want that.
-Where's Daniel?

09:05.541 --> 09:09.166
We got into it, and he stormed out.
Must run in the family.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.958
Well, I got dibs on his room.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.416
Let me know if I'm too loud.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.791
I'm gonna go do
something Bonnie absolutely hates.

09:14.875 --> 09:17.166
Gross! I don't wanna hear you spanking it!

09:17.250 --> 09:20.583
What? No, I'm gonna go watch <i>Bosch</i>,
Season Four.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.291
Ugh!

09:22.375 --> 09:23.708
That's worse.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.916
Good morning, honey. How did you sleep?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.083
Oh! It was great!

09:31.166 --> 09:34.625
It's so much better than the waterbed
I've been sleeping on at Diane's,

09:34.708 --> 09:37.416
which is actually an air mattress
filled with skunked beer.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.583
Mom, I don't need to be
treated like a kid--

09:39.666 --> 09:42.208
Oh, a smiley face!

09:42.291 --> 09:45.708
Well, you deserve it.
Unlike your unsupportive father.

09:45.791 --> 09:46.666
Mm-mm!

09:46.750 --> 09:49.875
This napkin is so soft,
would be great for--

09:50.791 --> 09:51.791
Never mind.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.750
I'm gonna take a light power walk
on the lakefront to blow off steam.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.083
Don't worry, I'm bringing my pepper spray.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.833
Whatever. I'm making Bloody Bulls.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.958
It's Bloody Marys with bouillon cubes.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.125
Fun fact, it was Hemingway's
drink of choice,

10:07.208 --> 10:09.000
right before he blew his brains out.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.458
-I didn't know you liked Ernest Hemingway.
-Who?

10:11.541 --> 10:14.041
No, Marty Hemingway, buddy of mine.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.000
Toll booth operator on 94.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.875
I miss him every day.

10:17.958 --> 10:18.958
To Marty!

10:20.750 --> 10:23.000
Hey! Sip or get off the pot.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.208
Ahh.

10:27.291 --> 10:29.791
And that's when I was like,
"Fine, I'll leave,

10:29.875 --> 10:31.250
because I don't need this…

10:32.083 --> 10:33.416
…shit."

10:33.500 --> 10:36.375
Mark! You finally grew a pair!

10:36.458 --> 10:37.625
Yeah, I did.

10:37.708 --> 10:41.708
And you know what? I'll massage them
when I want to, not when she tells me!

10:41.791 --> 10:43.708
Hell yeah, you will!

10:43.791 --> 10:45.458
Should I make us another round?

10:45.541 --> 10:47.541
No, I can't. I think one's my limit.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.375
Jordan for three!

10:50.416 --> 10:53.291
-Whoo! Nothing but tongue!
-Yes! Yeah, baby!

10:53.375 --> 10:55.750
Watch out Marky-Mark,
that's not a toy.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.000
This is a Gibson!

10:57.083 --> 10:58.958
Eddie Vedder gave that to me.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.791
I jumped in front of his tour bus
and threatened to sue.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.250
You know,
I was in a yacht rock band in college.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.708
Now, let's see if I still got it.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.208
Yeah!

11:11.791 --> 11:13.250
Do it!

11:16.875 --> 11:18.833
Mark! You kind of rock.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.333
Do you really mean that?

11:20.916 --> 11:22.666
Yeah, I think I do.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.083
Whoa, Mom! A little privacy?

11:27.166 --> 11:29.875
There's no privacy with your Mommy.

11:29.958 --> 11:30.791
Um…

11:30.875 --> 11:34.625
Did you move all my old stuff back
into my room while I was in the shower?

11:34.708 --> 11:36.958
Yeah! Say hi to Pugs Bunny.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.416
-Ah…

11:38.500 --> 11:40.125
Where's Dad's Peloton bike?

11:40.208 --> 11:41.500
I'm sorry, who?

11:43.208 --> 11:48.208
I threw it into the basement,
AKA your father's "dungeon of lies."

11:48.291 --> 11:49.375
But enough about him,

11:49.458 --> 11:51.458
I want to talk about you
and how cute you are.

11:51.541 --> 11:54.666
Okay, so,
I'm gonna get dressed.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.625
Okay, got it. Enough said.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.916
-So happy my baby's home!
-Ah! Mom!

12:06.208 --> 12:08.541
Okay. You said you wanted a cool cut,

12:08.625 --> 12:12.000
so I tried to make you look like Jin
from BTS.

12:12.083 --> 12:16.000
I have absolutely no idea who that is,
but this haircut is awesome!

12:16.083 --> 12:17.875
I'm feeling like a whole new Mark!

12:17.958 --> 12:20.916
And best of all, Bonnie would <i>not</i> approve!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.375
-Upper decker! Yeah!
-Yes!

12:24.583 --> 12:26.708
I don't think you know what that means.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.708
So, what are you gonna do now, roomie?

12:28.791 --> 12:30.916
Well, it is cold one o'clock…

12:31.000 --> 12:33.916
Oh, I'd kill for a brewski right now!

12:34.000 --> 12:39.458
But I can't because Ideon-gay doesn't
allow inking-dray on the ob-jay.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.791
Your pig Latin is
better than your English.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.833
Well, there's gonna be one
with your name on it when you get home.

12:44.916 --> 12:47.416
Yes! Best roommate ever!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.250
Best <i>roommates</i> ever!

12:49.333 --> 12:54.708
Best roommates ever!
Best roommates ever! Best roommates ever!

12:55.208 --> 12:56.041
Aah!

12:56.125 --> 12:59.041
I gotta tell you,
I don't miss Daniel one bit.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.750
I was doing all the heavy lifting
with that kid.

13:01.833 --> 13:04.416
Always dragging him along for the ride.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.833
Call me crazy,
but Mark's actually cooler than Daniel.

13:07.916 --> 13:09.791
-No, he's not!
-No, you're fucking crazy.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.125
Mm! It smells like
a wet bread bowl in here.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.375
Yum-yum-yum.

13:17.458 --> 13:20.083
Say hello to the Master Brewers.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.541
Fuck the Brewers!

13:21.625 --> 13:24.541
No. I've been making my own beer
with the help of these guys,

13:24.625 --> 13:26.916
and I thought I'd name
the first batch after you.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.958
I call it "Diane Dunbrewski."

13:30.041 --> 13:31.541
Ooh!

13:31.625 --> 13:35.375
You know how many beers
Daniel's made me? Zero.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.541
Yeah, well, you know, he's underage.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.541
It tastes like Chicago River water.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.083
Ooh. That bad, huh?

13:45.166 --> 13:48.416
Bad? That's the highest compliment I give.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.041
Yes! Cheers!

13:51.291 --> 13:54.333
<i>This is Saturday Sounds.</i>
<i>Here's one from Nathan Whitehead.</i>

13:54.416 --> 13:56.000
So, tomorrow is Sunday.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.666
Your father and I usually
pull up weeds in the garden

13:58.750 --> 14:00.958
and check the house
for cracks in the foundation.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.333
Every week?

14:03.083 --> 14:04.625
So, what time can you start?

14:04.708 --> 14:07.666
I'm guessing you want to sleep in,
so, should we say 7:00?

14:07.750 --> 14:10.000
I'm sorry, do you mean 7:00 a.m.?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.416
Of course.

14:11.500 --> 14:16.250
7:00 p.m. on Sundays
is reserved for soup and <i>60 Minutes.</i>

14:16.333 --> 14:19.791
Yeah, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I wanna do any of that.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.833
Sundays are usually
designated as "Fundays."

14:22.916 --> 14:24.333
Unless we sleep through it,

14:24.416 --> 14:27.625
then Sunday Funday gets folded
into that week's Thirsty Thursday.

14:27.708 --> 14:28.916
We usually don't wake up

14:29.000 --> 14:30.916
until the good burrito place
opens at noon.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.666
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm not as wild as your aunt.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.125
I didn't say that.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.458
Yes, Diane likes to do fun stuff,
but she can also be a bit much.

14:39.541 --> 14:42.625
Oh, I know. I've been dealing with her
for years, and your father,

14:42.708 --> 14:45.958
who, by the way,
also has many negative character traits.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.666
Yeah, you listed them at lunch.
And breakfast.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.500
At dinner, I'll get into
how he's terrified of ladybugs.

14:51.583 --> 14:52.958
Mom, enough!

14:53.041 --> 14:56.208
Whatever happened between you two,
you're not getting a divorce!

14:56.291 --> 14:59.583
So, just call him, tell him
to come home and figure it out!

14:59.666 --> 15:02.750
Well, look who knows what's best
for everyone else now!

15:02.833 --> 15:05.750
I can see that Diane
has really rubbed off on you.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.625
Whatever! Just call him!

15:10.291 --> 15:12.416
What do you say we order a deep-dish?

15:12.500 --> 15:16.833
Oh-- Shit, you're probably one of those
no meat, no dairy fuckers.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.458
Oh, no, I love that stuff!

15:18.541 --> 15:22.291
It's Bonnie who's all,
"Mark, this has saturated fat,"

15:22.375 --> 15:25.291
and, "Mark, your farts stink
when you eat cheese."

15:25.375 --> 15:27.291
Fudge off! I'll eat what I want.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.875
Attaboy!

15:28.958 --> 15:32.375
Okay, two large deep-dish,
one sausage, one plain,

15:32.458 --> 15:33.708
which means pepperoni.

15:33.791 --> 15:34.625
Coming up!

15:34.708 --> 15:36.750
-Ah! Speak of the devil.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.625
You know, I'm just gonna
put her on speaker. Hello?

15:39.708 --> 15:41.416
-<i>Mark, come home now.</i>

15:41.500 --> 15:43.333
-Thank you, I'll be right there.

15:43.416 --> 15:44.791
What the hell was that?

15:44.875 --> 15:46.708
Diane, I'm so sorry. I need to go.

15:46.791 --> 15:47.958
You're leaving me?

15:48.041 --> 15:49.791
-Can you at least pay for the pizza?

15:49.875 --> 15:51.000
Sorry!

15:57.791 --> 15:58.625
Dad?

15:58.708 --> 15:59.666
Hey, bud.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.666
Ugh! It's so early.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.958
Drank a bit too much
over the last few days.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.875
Just trying to sweat out the toxins.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.041
-Are you wearing a wig?

16:09.125 --> 16:12.583
No. I got it cut.
Don't I look like Jin from MBS?

16:12.666 --> 16:14.083
You mean BTS.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.375
MBS is the prince of Saudi Arabia.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.375
So, did you and Mom make up?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.250
Eh. We haven't really talked about it yet.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.250
Hopefully, we never have to
and everything can go back to normal.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.166
You know how I feel about confrontation.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.041
-Gives you diarrhea.
-Gives me diarrhea.

16:28.583 --> 16:31.541
How was Aunt Diane? Did she seem… okay?

16:31.625 --> 16:33.125
Did she say anything about me?

16:33.208 --> 16:34.541
Like missing me or…

16:34.625 --> 16:35.958
She's good.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.875
We actually had
a really great time.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.666
Yeah? Well, I've been having
a really great time here.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.250
Some would say I'm thriving.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.791
Oh, terrific. So, what do you have
planned for today?

16:45.875 --> 16:48.208
Well, technically, it's Margarita Monday.

16:48.291 --> 16:52.958
But since Diane's not here,
I guess now I don't have any plans.

16:53.041 --> 16:54.083
Oh, goody!

16:54.166 --> 16:57.208
Then, you can help me break down
those cardboard boxes in the garage.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.500
Should be fun.
Some of them are double-taped.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.416
Oh, yeah…

17:01.500 --> 17:06.166
I… actually remember I have plans
with some high school friends.

17:12.291 --> 17:15.125
Where are my ladies at?
I need some company.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.416
What about your roommate?
I want to say Matt?

17:17.500 --> 17:18.958
No, it's Clark.

17:19.041 --> 17:21.916
No, it's Mark,
and he left me too, the bastard.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.541
But I don't need him, I got you guys.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.291
My real best friends.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.708
You said last week
I'm not your best friend.

17:28.791 --> 17:32.958
Doesn't matter. What does matter
is me getting the support of my gals.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.166
Let's have a frickin' girls' night!

17:35.250 --> 17:36.291
What do you say?

17:36.375 --> 17:40.208
Diane, I think
some of us have plans tonight?

17:40.291 --> 17:41.291
What plans?

17:41.375 --> 17:45.375
Come on, Tin! Daniel left,
Mark bailed, I need to hang!

17:45.458 --> 17:48.208
Oh, right! We got Gideon's surprise thing!

17:48.291 --> 17:49.750
-I knew she'd ruin it.
-Diane!

17:49.833 --> 17:54.083
Diane, my entire life,
I have wanted a surprise party.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.541
And now, you have taken that from me.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.500
Sorry, but maybe it's better you know.

17:59.583 --> 18:03.000
My Uncle Ray had a surprise party
at Dick's Last Resort.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.541
Heart attack. Died on the spot.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.541
He was 450 pounds, though.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.166
Just go before you ruin it any further.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.250
Daniel! What's up, dude?

18:22.333 --> 18:23.916
Oh, hey, Greg.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.166
I thought we were going
to meet at your office.

18:26.250 --> 18:29.625
This is my office.
Yeah, man, I sell weed outside of here.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.041
Oh, gotcha.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.833
Well, that's not my only job.

18:32.916 --> 18:36.333
I was donating to the sperm bank,
but they put the kibosh on that.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.916
Psh, in the jizz biz,
it's all about who you know.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.250
I think your nose is bleeding.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.458
Oh-- Yeah, it does that.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.708
I was thinking about
hitting up the pep rally.

18:46.791 --> 18:50.708
Our high school's pep rally?
Like, where we already graduated from?

18:50.791 --> 18:52.833
Yep. I still go to all the games.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.666
Well, I mean,
I watch from across the street.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.875
I'm not allowed within 100 yards
of the school.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.500
-Oh.
-So cool you're back!

18:58.583 --> 19:00.875
We can hang all the time now!

19:03.791 --> 19:06.375
I thought Mark was
the perfect Daniel replacement.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.750
But honestly, Daniel was
always teaching me new stuff,

19:09.833 --> 19:13.166
like voting and fully chewing my food.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.875
Roommates suck.
My last one was my best friend,

19:15.958 --> 19:17.791
we hung out every night for years.

19:17.875 --> 19:21.208
Then one day, the remote's broken
and he won't cop to it!

19:21.291 --> 19:24.125
Words are said, he bolts,
I haven't seen him since.

19:24.208 --> 19:27.083
You blew up a whole friendship
over a remote control?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.083
It was a universal remote, Diane!

19:30.166 --> 19:32.666
I'm just pissed
I still got his kidney inside me.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.375
Anyway, flying solo is the way to go.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.000
Pro-tip for living alone.

19:37.083 --> 19:40.000
Get a dog
and teach it how to dial 911.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.458
Wow, that's bleak.

19:41.541 --> 19:42.750
That's my dog's name!

19:46.750 --> 19:49.375
See, Daniel, this is
what it could be like in the fall.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.583
You can live here
and commute to a local college,

19:52.666 --> 19:54.625
and the new baby will be here.

19:54.708 --> 19:57.625
Yeah, and I could hang out
with Greg all the time.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.958
Oh, oop. Got a little bit
of fat here.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.166
If that's a criticism,
you can cook dinner next time.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.708
I wasn't criticizing, I was commenting.
Lamb has gristle.

20:06.791 --> 20:09.208
Well, it felt like a criticism.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.541
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

20:13.666 --> 20:16.625
Daniel, would you mind role-playing
with us for a second,

20:16.708 --> 20:20.333
so your father can get back on board
with what we're trying to do here?

20:20.416 --> 20:23.083
Oh my God, stop!
Even your fights are boring.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.416
Everything about this place is boring!

20:25.500 --> 20:26.875
We're not boring!

20:27.416 --> 20:30.500
-Right?
-Um, no! Look at this haircut.

20:30.583 --> 20:31.833
Exactly.

20:31.916 --> 20:34.666
-Obviously, we're fixing that tomorrow.
-Oh, yeah. Obviously.

20:35.916 --> 20:40.750
<i>Al… I'm sorry I got a library card.</i>

20:40.833 --> 20:42.458
<i>It was long overdue.</i>

20:44.208 --> 20:47.375
This is the one
where Peg gets a… library card.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.291
<i> So, head on down</i>
<i>to Empire carpet… today.</i>

21:36.416 --> 21:37.583
Daniel!

21:37.666 --> 21:39.958
Aunt Diane! I was coming back to you!

21:40.041 --> 21:43.125
And I was coming to find you!
Stay right there.

21:46.875 --> 21:47.916
Ugh!

21:48.000 --> 21:50.250
Watch out for the third rail!

21:50.333 --> 21:52.083
That's an old wives' tale.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.958
Holy shit! The wives were right!

21:59.291 --> 22:00.416
Ugh!

22:00.500 --> 22:01.791
Huh!

22:01.875 --> 22:03.875
-Aunt Diane! No!

22:08.375 --> 22:11.583
Daniel, I'm sorry I got
all up in your business.

22:11.666 --> 22:14.500
You're my best friend
and I just want you to be happy.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.166
I'm sorry too.
I shouldn't have lashed out at you.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.791
I know you fuck shit up, but that's
what makes everything not boring!

22:20.875 --> 22:24.333
Daniel, I don't know if you need me,
but I know I need you.

22:24.416 --> 22:27.416
Let's promise to not leave
each other ever again.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
Deal.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.541
Let's blood-oath this shit!

22:31.625 --> 22:35.250
No. But I missed your knife.

22:35.791 --> 22:38.666
So technically,
it is still Margarita Monday.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.375
Hell yeah, it is!

22:40.458 --> 22:42.458
And I know a party we can hit up.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.500
That's not even a real song!

22:50.583 --> 22:53.791
My God, how can someone
ruin the same party twice?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.875
Diane, if you're gonna sing,

22:55.958 --> 22:58.291
at least make it something
we can dance to.

22:58.375 --> 22:59.625
Copy that.
