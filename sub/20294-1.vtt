-IT'S SLICED UP BAD.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.367

09:05.467 --> 09:09.067
-HER AND HER BOYFRIEND,

09:18.100 --> 09:20.633
AND THE REST OF THEM
CAME TO THE BACK

09:20.733 --> 09:23.167
THEY CIRCLED ME
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

09:23.267 --> 09:27.767
AND ME AND HER FOUGHT AND...
-YEAH.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.300
-AND THEY SAID, "THE HELL DID

09:30.400 --> 09:33.500
AND I DIDN'T. I-- I'M
SORRY, I TOOK HER TABLET

09:33.600 --> 09:36.667
BUT THAT'S NO RIGHT FOR HER
IN SENDING PEOPLE TO DO THAT.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.333
-OKAY, HOW DID SHE GET CUT?

09:38.433 --> 09:40.700
-WHEN I CAME OUT HERE
TO GET MY STUFF,

09:40.800 --> 09:43.333
THE ONE GUY WOULDN'T LET ME
AND I WAS SCARED.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.733
I HAD ROCKS IN MY HAND...
-MM-HMM.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.100
-AND WHEN I LET THEM GO
THEY (bleep) JUMPED ME.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.600
AND THEN I FORGOT I HAD
THE RAZOR BLADE IN MY POCKET.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.633
AND WHEN I REMEMBERED,
THEY HAD ME ON THE GROUND.

09:53.733 --> 09:58.933
I WAS ONLY ABLE TO CUT HER LEG
'CAUSE I WANTED TO GET
THEM OFF OF ME.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.033
-SO YOU TOOK THE RAZOR BLADE
OUT OF YOUR POCKET?

10:01.133 --> 10:02.667
-YES.
-AND YOU CUT HER?

10:02.767 --> 10:06.600
-I CUT HER LEG BUT IT WAS
BECAUSE SHE PUT ME
IN A CHOKE HOLD.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.500
SHE WAS KICKING ME
AND HURTING ME.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.800
-YOU ALREADY TOLD ME,
BUY YOU'RE ON COCAINE RIGHT NOW?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.867
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ON?
ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW

10:13.967 --> 10:16.900
ABOUT THAT I NEED TO
TELL THE MEDICS?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.100
YES? NO?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
-CAN YOU JUST SHUT THE DOOR?

10:20.300 --> 10:21.667
-YOU WANT ME TO LET

10:21.767 --> 10:23.567
-YEAH.

10:27.667 --> 10:28.833
HEY, MAN.
-Man: YES?

10:28.933 --> 10:30.667

10:30.767 --> 10:33.900
WE FOUND OUT SHE STOLE
OUR DAUGHTER'S TABLET.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.433
-YEAH.
-WE GOT A CALL THAT SHE
WAS DOWN THE STREET.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.467
WE GO DOWN THERE
TO CONFRONT HER ABOUT IT.

10:39.567 --> 10:42.067
HER AND MY WIFE
GOT INTO A FIGHT.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.733
MY WIFE GOT THE BEST OF HER.

10:44.833 --> 10:47.200
TALKING TO A FEW FRIENDS,
SHE WAS DOWN HERE.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.967

OUT OF OUR HOUSE.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.133
SO, WE GET A PHONE CALL
FROM THE MAINTENANCE MAN

10:52.233 --> 10:53.667

11:00.133 --> 11:02.233
START WALKING DOWN THE STREET...

11:02.333 --> 11:04.833

12:04.633 --> 12:07.133

12:10.267 --> 12:12.133
-YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN SEE.

12:16.433 --> 12:19.467
'CAUSE SHE COME UP

12:19.567 --> 12:21.633
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.600
THIS WINDOW WENT,
AND THEN THIS WINDOW WENT.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.400
AND I YELLED OUT, "WHO ELSE

BUSTING WINDOWS?"

12:27.500 --> 12:30.400
SHE GOES, "NOBODY'S OUT HERE."
AND THEN 30 SECONDS LATER

12:30.500 --> 12:33.633
THE BACK WINDOW SMASHES

12:36.633 --> 12:39.167
-ALL RIGHT, SO TELL ME

12:39.267 --> 12:42.500

HER HAND, SHE SLICED UP
THE BACK OF MY LEG.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.067
-IN THE ROAD?
-YEAH.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.867

12:54.067 --> 12:55.933
-MY HUSBAND GRABBED HER.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.933
IT'S HUMID A GOOD
MAJORITY OF THE YEAR.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.667
IT MAKES THE JOB HARD,
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHTTIME.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.067
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
WHEN IT'S BETWEEN SEASONS

15:44.833 --> 15:46.767

15:55.900 --> 15:57.433
-WHAT'S THE STORY WITH
THIS LADY AND THE CATS?

15:57.533 --> 16:00.067
-WE WERE OKAY UNTIL

16:00.167 --> 16:02.567

16:07.700 --> 16:10.067
AND WE WEREN'T ON HER PROPERTY.
THEY WALKED OVER THERE

16:10.167 --> 16:14.333
TO GET THEM ON THE SIDEWALK,
AND SHE FREAKED OUT

16:14.433 --> 16:16.167
CUSSING AT THEM.
I WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.100
-AT YOU GUYS?
-THEY WALKED OVER THERE.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.867

I'M AN ANIMAL LOVER.

16:20.967 --> 16:23.333
-YEAH, ME TOO. LISTEN--
-AND SHE JUST GOT FOUR KITTENS
TOOKEN AWAY FROM HER

16:23.433 --> 16:26.233

16:26.333 --> 16:27.767
-AND DROPPING THEM.
-I MEAN...

16:27.867 --> 16:30.133
SHE CAN HAVE CATS,
THE CATS CAN BE OUTSIDE.

16:30.233 --> 16:32.067
THERE'S NOTHING AGAINST
THE LAW ABOUT THAT.

16:32.167 --> 16:35.067
MY CONCERN WAS THE SAME--
I ASKED THE SAME THING YOU SAID.

16:35.133 --> 16:36.667

RUN ON THE ROAD. OKAY.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.600

16:38.700 --> 16:42.133
-WE WORRY ABOUT IT TOO.
-THAT'S WHY I WENT OVER THERE
TRYING TO AT LEAST KEEP THEM

16:42.233 --> 16:44.233
AWAY FROM THE ROAD.
SHE FREAKED OUT ON ME.
-YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.233
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND 'CAUSE
THAT WAS MY CONCERN AS WELL.

16:46.333 --> 16:49.133
I'M GONNA SEE IF WE CAN KEEP
THEM OUT OF HERE 'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT SEE THEM GET HIT EITHER.

16:49.233 --> 16:52.300
SO I'M GONNA TALK TO HER SOON,
BUT IF SHE REFUSES, I HONESTLY

16:52.400 --> 16:55.400
I-- I CAN'T DO MUCH.
LET ME GO TALK TO HER,

16:55.500 --> 16:57.933
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO,
MAYBE KEEP THEM IN THE BACKYARD.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.833
I DON'T KNOW.
-AT LEAST BOX THEM IN
OR BLOCK THE HOLE.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.867
-YEAH. WELL, WE'LL TRY, MAN.

17:04.267 --> 17:05.400
KITTY KITTY!

17:05.500 --> 17:07.433

THEIR CONCERN WAS

17:13.067 --> 17:14.467
THEY DIDN'T WANT
THEM GETTING HIT?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.100
SAME THING I ASK YOU.
THEY DON'T RUN IN THE ROAD.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.800
UH, THEY SAID YOU HAD A CAT
THAT WAS HIT BY A CAR RECENTLY?

17:19.900 --> 17:22.267
-YOU'LL GET A LOT OF STRAYS
THAT ARE HIT BY CARS.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.667
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU CAN'T WATCH EVERY STRAY

17:24.767 --> 17:26.600

-I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.667

17:31.067 --> 17:33.067
-I KNOW.
-WHAT ARE THEY SO CONCERNED?

17:33.100 --> 17:34.733
WHY DON'T THEY
MIND THEIR BUSINESS

17:34.833 --> 17:36.567
AND STAY IN THEIR
RENTAL OVER THERE?

17:36.667 --> 17:38.400
-I DON'T KNOW. HOW DO

18:13.933 --> 18:15.600
-(sighs)
-IT'S NONE OF THEIR
DAMN BUSINESS.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.167
-THEY'RE JUST CONCERNED.
-IT'S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.200

BE SO CONCERNED.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.067

18:31.967 --> 18:33.867
HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG FAT
PIECE OF ASS, ANYWAY.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.667
WHY DOESN'T HE BUY
SOME DECENT CLOTHES?

18:35.767 --> 18:37.500
-I DIDN'T BUY HIS CLOTHES.
-'CAUSE HE'S A PIG.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.367

WHY DOES SHE HATE YOU SO MUCH?

18:59.100 --> 19:00.600
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE HATES ME.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.300
I SIT THERE TRYING--
-HAVE YOU TALKED TO HER?

19:02.400 --> 19:05.933

19:17.967 --> 19:20.300
IF IT'S RUNNING AROUND
AND IT'S IN DANGER,

19:20.400 --> 19:22.367
-IF IT'S IN THE ROAD
OR SOMETHING I'M GONNA--

19:22.467 --> 19:24.900

PROBLEMS AGAIN BUT

THE HILLS OF APPALACHIA?

19:28.233 --> 19:30.733

HAVE HER CATS OUT THERE.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.633
-Officer over radio:
