FRANK (VOICEOVER): Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express!

00:11.778 --> 00:15.601
Come and watch pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:15.706 --> 00:21.512
they were given by him upstairs and kids they're convinced

00:21.616 --> 00:22.833
aren't actually theirs.

00:22.937 --> 00:27.352
What sounds on Earth could ever replace kids needing

00:27.456 --> 00:29.856
money or wives in your face?

00:29.960 --> 00:32.775
'cause this, people reckon, and me included,

00:32.880 --> 00:36.391
is why pubs and drugs were kindly

00:36.495 --> 00:42.197
invented to calm us all down and stop us going mental.

00:42.301 --> 00:46.680
These are Chatsworth Estate's basic essentials.

00:46.785 --> 00:50.714
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:50.818 --> 00:55.546
You shit on our heads, but you pay the taxes.

00:58.917 --> 01:02.220
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers

01:02.325 --> 01:05.593
who'd cum on your face for the price of a beer.

01:05.697 --> 01:08.025
Make poverty history.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.008
Cheaper drugs now!

01:10.111 --> 01:12.545
Make poverty history.

01:12.649 --> 01:16.961
Cheaper drugs now!

01:17.065 --> 01:18.004
Scatter!

01:18.108 --> 01:18.976
Party!

01:29.058 --> 01:31.491
FRANK (VOICEOVER): A good friend once said to me--

01:31.596 --> 01:33.195
Bob the Bullshit, I think--

01:33.300 --> 01:38.236
everybody's at it, and if they're not, they should be.

01:38.340 --> 01:45.188
Meaning, I suppose, that nobody is actually who they seem.

01:45.292 --> 01:48.283
We're all of us deceiving each other

01:48.387 --> 01:49.674
and ourselves most of the time.

01:49.778 --> 01:51.237
[knock on door]

01:51.341 --> 01:54.923
Pretending to be something, or someone, that we're not.

01:57.911 --> 02:00.902
And nothing is what it seems.

02:01.006 --> 02:03.162
Do you ever give up, Tom?

02:03.266 --> 02:05.247
Please, not now.

02:05.351 --> 02:07.055
Don't flatter yourself.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.064
Where's Frank?

02:08.168 --> 02:09.175
What's he done now?

02:14.494 --> 02:15.364
Jesus.

02:19.362 --> 02:20.787
Leave it out!

02:20.891 --> 02:21.760
What are you doing?

02:21.864 --> 02:23.116
He's wanted.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.855
Does he look like he's ever had a credit card?

02:24.958 --> 02:27.739
Over 20 grand owed on this Visa.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.312
Another 12 on a new car, two on a plasma,

02:30.416 --> 02:32.850
four on a fortnight in Dubai.

02:32.954 --> 02:33.962
Hello?

02:34.067 --> 02:35.074
Sun-kissed.

02:35.179 --> 02:36.222
Three different addresses.

02:36.326 --> 02:37.786
And Frank's details on them all!

02:40.289 --> 02:42.202
FRANK: Sod it.

02:42.306 --> 02:44.600
Well done, dad.

02:44.705 --> 02:45.747
It'll be a mistake.

02:45.852 --> 02:46.894
There's no need to manhandle him.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.945
FRANK: What's with the bad manners?

02:49.050 --> 02:50.301
We know it wasn't you.

02:50.405 --> 02:53.048
So why the brutality?

02:53.152 --> 02:55.272
Yeah, harassment!

02:55.377 --> 02:59.235
Lorraine Kelly here going all Reagan and Carter.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.122
Your identity was stolen.

03:02.226 --> 03:03.338
My identity?

03:03.443 --> 03:04.833
STAN: Have a look at this.

03:04.936 --> 03:05.841
There's nothing sacred.

03:05.945 --> 03:08.135
STAN: It's your civic duty.

03:08.239 --> 03:09.630
You ignored three summonses.

03:09.735 --> 03:11.576
We had no choice but to collect you.

03:11.681 --> 03:12.550
Duh!

03:12.654 --> 03:14.288
I'm exempt.

03:14.393 --> 03:18.426
Special dispensation, byproduct of a colorful existence.

03:18.530 --> 03:22.006
You haven't got a criminal record.

03:22.111 --> 03:23.605
I have-- I haven't.

03:23.709 --> 03:24.718
'Course I haven't!

03:24.822 --> 03:26.699
Well, not now, anyway.

03:26.803 --> 03:28.993
STAN: The system crashed and was unable to differentiate

03:29.097 --> 03:30.280
where the ID theft began.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.957
Couldn't specify which crimes were yours.

03:33.061 --> 03:34.069
So they all got wiped.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.051
STAN: You're a very lucky man.

03:36.155 --> 03:37.476
Clean slate.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.674
TOM: The whole world of employment opportunities.

03:40.778 --> 03:43.108
STAN: And eligible for jury service.

03:43.212 --> 03:46.827
[music playing]

03:53.189 --> 03:54.406
All right, Frank?

03:54.510 --> 03:55.379
All right, Dessie.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.699
Hiya, Frank.

04:00.803 --> 04:02.124
FRANK: All right, Phil.

04:08.346 --> 04:09.842
Excuse me.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.708
Guaranteed to see some stars.

04:14.812 --> 04:16.689
Easy money, mate.

MC Tunes in the pink limo crib.

04:20.897 --> 04:22.634

04:22.738 --> 04:24.338
Let's have it!

04:24.442 --> 04:25.241
Fuck's sake!

04:25.346 --> 04:26.736
How do you spell 'provocateur'?

04:26.840 --> 04:27.675
Oi!

04:27.779 --> 04:30.595
Got punters out here.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.376
No, like, in the posh knickers.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.663
All right?

04:34.767 --> 04:38.834
These babies will reach all your parts.

04:38.938 --> 04:40.642
Make yourselves comfy.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.239
SHANE: Don't drive too fast!

04:56.703 --> 04:58.059
Hacienda.

04:58.163 --> 04:59.136
Used to love it in there, me.

04:59.241 --> 05:00.492
Those flats?

05:00.596 --> 05:02.473
MICKY: The Sex Pistols played there in the 60s,

05:02.577 --> 05:04.003
and loads of other bands saw them.

05:04.107 --> 05:05.359
Not 1976?

05:05.464 --> 05:07.445
The Free Trade Hall?

05:07.549 --> 05:08.383
Nah.

05:08.489 --> 05:10.017
That's an hotel.

05:10.122 --> 05:12.764
Where's Canal Street from here?

05:12.868 --> 05:14.502
What you wanna know that for?

05:20.516 --> 05:23.541
Was terrifying the first time.

05:23.644 --> 05:24.549
It's a sensitive area.

05:24.653 --> 05:26.913
That's my role, though, Pat.

05:27.017 --> 05:28.580
This could be my last chance.

05:28.686 --> 05:29.590
I'm a good mother.

05:29.694 --> 05:30.945
It's what I excel at.

05:31.050 --> 05:34.179
Loads of men have them reversed.

05:34.283 --> 05:35.882
Realize they've made a mistake.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.307
It wasn't a mistake.

05:37.411 --> 05:39.150
We've had enough for a hurling team.

05:39.254 --> 05:41.131
And lost one.

05:41.235 --> 05:43.877
We don't want any more at this stage in our life.

05:43.982 --> 05:45.442
We should be content with our grandchild.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.145
[baby crying] - But she's not here, yeah?

05:47.250 --> 05:49.753
She's two doors away, maybe.

05:49.857 --> 05:50.866
Listen.

05:50.970 --> 05:54.237
But it doesn't feel like enough, Paddy.

05:54.341 --> 05:56.011
Why is she always crying?

05:56.114 --> 05:58.582
God knows what that Liam's doing when Mandy's not looking.

05:58.686 --> 06:01.017
That was a definite error of judgment forging a union

06:01.120 --> 06:03.345
with that pikey gene pool.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.048
Mercy, she's such a doll.

06:05.153 --> 06:07.552
[baby crying]

06:09.394 --> 06:11.097
They'd be better off here.

06:11.202 --> 06:12.384
There's hardly the room.

06:12.488 --> 06:15.548
I'd happily kick out Scooby or Shaggy.

06:15.652 --> 06:18.399
Maybe that's what I need to stop the yearning.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.597
And if you're shirking your genetic responsibility.

06:21.701 --> 06:23.612
Hey, I've been a prolific provider.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.351
She might come home here.

06:25.455 --> 06:27.540
Her and the baby.

06:27.645 --> 06:28.514
Whatcha think?

06:28.618 --> 06:31.225
It could be a plan.

Why's Shane dressed like Buddy Holly?

06:36.580 --> 06:38.978
PROSECUTOR: The seriousness of these accusations

06:39.082 --> 06:41.134
cannot be overestimated.

06:41.238 --> 06:44.783
Selling counterfeit merchandise is indicative of the insidious

06:44.887 --> 06:47.738
methods criminal networks employ to fund

06:47.843 --> 06:49.755
their illegal activities.

06:49.859 --> 06:51.841
Pay attention.

07:23.025 --> 07:23.893
Yeah.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.255
Came prepared?

07:30.359 --> 07:33.106
As always.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.494
Bored off me tits.

07:38.598 --> 07:40.893
Can get tedious.

07:40.996 --> 07:43.153
Are you familiar with the surroundings?

07:43.257 --> 07:44.230
Come whenever I can.

07:44.334 --> 07:46.594
But only the public gallery.

07:46.698 --> 07:49.202
Yeah, I've been a regular, myself.

07:49.306 --> 07:50.453
Only the cheap seats, though.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.879
If you know what I mean.

08:00.082 --> 08:02.481
PROSECUTOR: I happen to imagine if I were selling

08:02.585 --> 08:06.932
counterfeit goods to raise funds for a terrorist cell or a drug

08:07.036 --> 08:09.990

here if you're lucky.

08:47.535 --> 08:48.926
Way!

08:49.030 --> 08:49.899
This is mental!

No danger there.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.115
But she's got this notion that you and Katie moving in

09:25.219 --> 09:29.112
will be an adequate surrogate.

09:29.218 --> 09:30.260
There's no space.

10:47.992 --> 10:49.939
to sellers like this being involved

10:58.386 --> 11:01.968

11:02.071 --> 11:04.123
Liverpool, city of vultures.

11:04.227 --> 11:06.243
The whole town's counterfeit.

11:06.347 --> 11:08.677
They all wear fake clothes?

11:08.781 --> 11:10.241
No it's a simile.

11:10.345 --> 11:11.528
But probably.

11:11.632 --> 11:14.517
You know, Chupmunk-Cilla's features.

11:14.621 --> 11:16.324
Tarby's humor.

11:16.429 --> 11:19.175
Community spirit in the face of adversity.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.609
How many of them actually work?

11:21.713 --> 11:24.425
Dark Side of the Moon while smoking weed.

11:24.529 --> 11:27.275
Playing X-Boxes all day long.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.335
Nothing is as it seems down the East Lancs.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.907
Fake football shirts, Helen, are the tip

11:33.011 --> 11:35.167
of his particular iceberg.

11:35.271 --> 11:36.627
The slave trade.

11:36.731 --> 11:39.026
The Three Graces.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.286
Icing on the crown of the Scouse nation.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.954
My dad's from Liverpool.

11:43.058 --> 11:43.997
No offense.

11:44.101 --> 11:47.055
It's OK.

11:47.159 --> 11:48.794
I never really thought of it like that.

11:54.044 --> 11:54.912
CARRIE: Uh!

11:55.016 --> 11:55.921
Yes!

11:56.025 --> 11:56.930
Oh!

11:57.033 --> 11:57.973
Uh!

11:58.077 --> 11:59.050
Yes! Yes!

11:59.154 --> 11:59.988
Yes!

12:02.665 --> 12:03.499
Bingo.

12:11.739 --> 12:12.399
You're on late?

12:12.503 --> 12:14.797
Still got plenty stew.

12:14.902 --> 12:15.736
Coffee?

12:19.282 --> 12:22.793
[apprehensive music]

12:26.757 --> 12:29.016
TOM: Sorry about any confusion yesterday.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.382
Frank?

12:44.485 --> 12:45.806
Frank, come on!

12:51.438 --> 12:52.934
[girl stirs]

12:55.333 --> 12:56.584
Frank you've got a lift to court.

13:01.277 --> 13:02.285
Frank!

13:02.389 --> 13:03.223
Let him have it.

13:03.328 --> 13:04.857
Let him have it!

13:04.962 --> 13:07.117
What is your problem?

13:07.221 --> 13:08.298
Stalker.

13:08.403 --> 13:10.246
Been reading Catcher in the Rye.

13:10.351 --> 13:11.984
It's a misunderstanding.

13:12.088 --> 13:13.409
I just came to give him a lift.

13:13.513 --> 13:14.834
Is that a copper's job?

13:14.939 --> 13:17.651
Or has he been fast-tracked to judge?

13:17.755 --> 13:20.015
And to apologize for yesterday.

13:20.119 --> 13:21.649
Being rough.

13:21.753 --> 13:23.040
Get past it, Tom.

13:23.144 --> 13:29.992
We're O-V-E-R. You're freaking me out now.

13:30.096 --> 13:33.087
[music blaring]

13:34.650 --> 13:35.519
No, thanks.

13:35.624 --> 13:36.840
That's all right.

13:36.944 --> 13:39.586
It's not really my thing.

13:39.690 --> 13:42.681
But it makes the tour more real, if you know what I mean.

13:42.785 --> 13:44.002
Look, without these little beauties,

13:44.106 --> 13:46.088
there wouldn't even be a Madchester.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.722
I said I'm not interested.

13:59.401 --> 14:01.349
Kit.

14:01.453 --> 14:04.374
[officers giggling]

14:09.345 --> 14:10.388
How's that funny?

14:14.038 --> 14:15.464
OFFICER: Can't you take a joke?

14:21.164 --> 14:23.250
Do you think that's funny, Bill?

14:23.354 --> 14:27.875
Men taking advantage of pubescent girls?

14:27.979 --> 14:29.022
All the same.

14:32.324 --> 14:33.888
STAN: I was just trying to lighten the mood.

14:33.992 --> 14:34.827
Make you smile.

14:38.129 --> 14:40.598
But you shouldn't have gone round there, this morning.

14:40.701 --> 14:42.161
Won't do either of you any good.

14:42.265 --> 14:47.307
I mean, Frank can't expect a [gags] What's that?

14:47.411 --> 14:49.045
You cheeky little-- - Touche.

14:49.150 --> 14:50.541
You don't know what you've started.

14:50.644 --> 14:51.548
What I started?

15:10.146 --> 15:11.085
What are you up to?

15:11.189 --> 15:13.170
Free country.

15:13.275 --> 15:14.318
Who are these?

15:14.423 --> 15:15.848
- Mates. - You two OK?

15:15.952 --> 15:16.787
The sound?

15:16.891 --> 15:19.672
I asked them.

15:19.776 --> 15:21.724
Girls?

15:21.827 --> 15:22.697
We're fine, thanks.

15:27.181 --> 15:28.189
Can't switch off.

15:28.293 --> 15:29.267
Needs a truncheon up her--

15:29.370 --> 15:30.310
Aghhh!

15:30.414 --> 15:32.674
Not the day for it, Maguire.

15:32.778 --> 15:34.411
Ah!

15:34.516 --> 15:35.559
Fuck!

15:35.663 --> 15:37.714
FRANK: The classic syndrome, Helen.

15:37.819 --> 15:40.078
Rob their pensions, medical cover.

15:40.183 --> 15:43.868
And who ends up with the yacht, Ferrari, and Spanish villa?

15:43.972 --> 15:45.293
Scousers?

15:45.397 --> 15:47.414
S-- Scou--

15:47.518 --> 15:50.021
Well, yeah, yeah, sometimes it's Scousers, the rich ones,

15:50.125 --> 15:53.393
but whoever it is, you can guarantee they won't have

15:53.497 --> 15:55.826
come from places like we did.

15:55.930 --> 15:58.851
I've never met anyone who talks like you.

15:58.955 --> 16:01.285
I can't believe I'm here, in the beating

16:01.389 --> 16:02.988
heart, with such wonderful people

16:03.092 --> 16:06.081
and actually getting money for it.

16:06.187 --> 16:09.906
Well, my pearls falling on appreciative ears

16:10.010 --> 16:12.374
has helped numb the tedium. - That's nice.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.179
Home beck-- what you mean getting money for it?

16:18.284 --> 16:20.057
You must've have been asleep.

16:20.161 --> 16:21.761
Expenses. Match your wages.

16:21.864 --> 16:22.734
Fantastic.

16:33.267 --> 16:34.414
Why are we still here?

16:34.518 --> 16:35.875
Ready now.

16:35.979 --> 16:36.847
Look!

16:36.952 --> 16:38.064
Frank Sidebottom!

16:38.169 --> 16:39.177
Who?

16:39.281 --> 16:40.498
Frank Sidebottom.

16:40.602 --> 16:42.167
- What does that mean? - Him there.

16:42.271 --> 16:43.175
Off the telly.

16:52.179 --> 16:52.840
MICKY: What?

16:52.944 --> 16:54.021
TOURIST 3: Refund.

16:54.126 --> 16:55.308
Why?

16:55.412 --> 16:57.567
Look, we didn't say anything to that policewoman,

16:57.672 --> 17:00.835
but aside from trying to force drugs on us,

17:00.939 --> 17:02.782
this is a total crock of shit.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.588
Where you going?

17:08.692 --> 17:10.326
It'll be me they come looking for.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.445
Well, you shouldn't be so stupid.

17:12.550 --> 17:13.663
Hurry up!

17:20.684 --> 17:23.084
Let me guess.

17:23.188 --> 17:26.003
Hey, Yvonne, how much do you pay your workers?

17:26.108 --> 17:28.193
Pfft, you've got no chance.

17:28.299 --> 17:29.410
It's not Remploy.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.149
I shall ignore slander in the interest

17:31.254 --> 17:32.261
of my business proposition.

17:32.365 --> 17:35.217
Oh, lend us that.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.616
Jury expenses.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.867
Just leave that to me.

17:38.971 --> 17:41.405
Started the job yesterday 80:20 split.

18:14.638 --> 18:17.663
[radio chatter]

18:37.930 --> 18:39.460
CARRIE: There's no way out!

18:55.834 --> 18:59.171
Make it easy on yourself and I'll make it easier on you.

19:03.865 --> 19:05.845
Backup's on the way.

19:13.772 --> 19:17.387
Ripping innocent people off again?

19:17.492 --> 19:20.829
You lot never learn.

19:20.934 --> 19:23.506
[floor creaks]

19:28.199 --> 19:30.632
I've called the dogs.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.545
So, if you don't want an Alsatian's

19:32.649 --> 19:35.777

19:35.882 --> 19:41.096

19:41.201 --> 19:42.522
I'm blind!

19:42.626 --> 19:43.983
My eyes!

19:44.087 --> 19:46.033
What was that for?

19:46.137 --> 19:47.041
CARRIE: Right, get up, Saul.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.718
I'll support ya.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.777
Come on.

19:52.881 --> 19:54.237
[screams]

19:54.341 --> 19:56.879
What's happened?

19:56.984 --> 19:58.339
What's it look like?

19:58.443 --> 20:00.077
I can't see.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.755
Stop whining and pull me out!

20:05.883 --> 20:06.926
You're stuck.

20:13.114 --> 20:15.235
I shall now ask the jury to retire

20:15.339 --> 20:16.556
and consider their verdict.

20:32.303 --> 20:34.877
Does anybody have any specific desire

20:34.981 --> 20:36.128
to take the role of foreman?

20:41.794 --> 20:42.629
All yours.

20:46.384 --> 20:50.833
Well, can I suggest we start with a quick show of hands?

20:50.937 --> 20:52.537
I presume we're all feeling the same.

20:52.641 --> 20:54.970
Probably be out of here in no time.

20:55.075 --> 20:57.508
So, all those who think the defendant's guilty?

21:06.581 --> 21:09.015
And all those who think the defendant's not guilty?

21:17.045 --> 21:19.339
Looks like we'll be back in the morning.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.286
[jurors groan]

21:23.338 --> 21:24.727

Now stop rubbing!

21:26.674 --> 21:28.448
MICKY: Just let me go and get some help.

21:28.552 --> 21:30.012
CARRIE: You won't come back.

21:30.116 --> 21:32.028
Well, I'll just phone me dad to bring the bolt cutters,

21:32.132 --> 21:32.966
then.

21:33.071 --> 21:34.706
Boo hoo

21:34.810 --> 21:36.581
Leave leave you here, anyway.

21:40.823 --> 21:43.117
Bet there's spiders.

21:43.222 --> 21:45.307
So?

21:45.411 --> 21:49.201
I'm making a complaint about you and unnecessary force.

21:49.306 --> 21:50.002
Again.

21:50.106 --> 21:53.687
[phone rings]

22:01.890 --> 22:03.594
Where's my baseball bat?

That's it!

Mimi!

23:09.367 --> 23:11.105
What's the mad bitch up to, now?

23:11.209 --> 23:12.739
Show some respect!

23:12.843 --> 23:13.505
It's stuck!

23:13.609 --> 23:14.895
What's going on?

23:14.999 --> 23:16.111
I don't know.

23:16.216 --> 23:20.248
If I just make room and clear it she'll come.

It's for you, babe, please come home.

I can't bear what they're doing to Katie.

23:29.356 --> 23:30.573
DEBBIE: What who's doing?

23:30.678 --> 23:32.902
Damien over there, and who knows who else.

23:33.006 --> 23:34.223
Why, watch what you're saying!

23:34.327 --> 23:35.822
- What's it got to do with you? - Leave it.

23:35.927 --> 23:36.935
No. We love Katie!

23:37.039 --> 23:39.646
- So why's she so unhappy. - Stella cries.

23:39.750 --> 23:40.759
Katie cries sometimes.

23:40.863 --> 23:41.732
It's a small house.

23:41.836 --> 23:43.331
That's the point.

23:43.436 --> 23:44.409
We would love you to come home.

23:48.025 --> 23:49.136
FRANK: This'll do.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.010
Maybe the pub.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.094
FRANK: Usual, Karen.

24:05.198 --> 24:10.031
One for yourself and, uh, your dearest.

24:10.135 --> 24:11.490
Someone's in a good mood.

24:11.594 --> 24:13.506
Well, it's nice to share the wealth when

24:13.612 --> 24:15.141
fortune smiles on the brave.

24:15.244 --> 24:20.633
And a tipple for my delectable other half, as well.

24:20.738 --> 24:24.631
So did the Scouser get a guilty?

24:24.736 --> 24:26.369
Well, I may have been a tad hasty.

24:26.473 --> 24:28.664
Oh, quell surprise.

24:28.768 --> 24:32.314
They've been much maligned, you know, Liverpudlians.

24:32.418 --> 24:33.704
Cousins, really.

24:33.809 --> 24:36.138
Many a worthy contributor to the general good.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.285
You reckon?

24:37.389 --> 24:38.432
Oh definitely.

24:38.536 --> 24:41.110
Such as?

24:41.214 --> 24:45.628
Erm, you know, Grobbelaar?

24:45.732 --> 24:46.845
Hatton!

24:46.949 --> 24:48.757
There was a heavyweight in his field.

24:48.861 --> 24:50.286
He's a welterweight from Stockport.

24:50.390 --> 24:51.225
No.

24:51.330 --> 24:52.859
Derek.

24:52.964 --> 24:56.962
So, who was the dizzy-looking bitch?

24:57.066 --> 24:57.900
Who?

25:00.437 --> 25:01.620
Oh.

25:01.724 --> 25:04.644
In the, you know, the thingy, foreman of the jury,

25:04.749 --> 25:06.556
on her way to hers.

25:06.660 --> 25:07.877
Bit mental.

25:07.981 --> 25:10.205
CARRIE: What are you doing?

25:10.311 --> 25:12.952
Smoking the evidence.

25:13.057 --> 25:14.273
Stop it!

25:14.377 --> 25:16.916
It's better than being gassed.

25:17.020 --> 25:18.445
Have some.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.454
It's illegal.

25:19.558 --> 25:20.392
So?

25:20.496 --> 25:21.887
I'm a policewoman.

25:21.992 --> 25:23.243
Everybody does it!

25:23.347 --> 25:25.398
I don't.

25:25.503 --> 25:26.894
Never tried?

25:26.998 --> 25:28.944
Never.

25:29.048 --> 25:30.265
Don't know what you're missing.

25:35.271 --> 25:36.452
Stop!

25:36.557 --> 25:38.609
Might chill you out.

25:38.713 --> 25:40.207
[slow music playing]

25:40.312 --> 25:42.190
[giggles]

25:46.326 --> 25:49.768
Dunno what all the fuss is about.

25:49.873 --> 25:51.992
So why'd you keep laughing, then?

25:59.501 --> 26:03.709
CARRIE: How come I've never seen you with a girlfriend?

26:03.812 --> 26:07.220
I've never seen you with a boyfriend.

26:07.324 --> 26:09.862
So?

26:09.966 --> 26:12.086
I don't want one at the moment.

26:12.190 --> 26:14.311
I'm concentrating on me writing.

26:14.416 --> 26:15.806
Can't you write?

26:15.910 --> 26:17.162
'Course!

26:17.266 --> 26:20.081
I mean, stories and that.

26:20.186 --> 26:21.855
CARRIE: Yeah?

26:21.959 --> 26:22.827
What kind of stories?

26:27.035 --> 26:27.938
Erotica

26:28.042 --> 26:36.109
[coughing] Sorry.

26:36.213 --> 26:37.046
It's all right.

26:39.550 --> 26:43.895
Personally, I think it's overrated.

26:43.999 --> 26:45.042
Erotica?

26:45.146 --> 26:46.155
Sex.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.032
You reckon?

26:48.136 --> 26:49.979
I prefer good arrest.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.821
Typical Dibble.

26:51.925 --> 26:53.769
Hardly typical!

26:53.872 --> 26:55.680
One day I'll be far from here.

26:55.784 --> 26:59.330
Chief super, somewhere fitting.

26:59.435 --> 27:01.381
Yeah, and I will too.

27:01.485 --> 27:02.320
What?

27:02.425 --> 27:03.883
Be far from here.

27:03.989 --> 27:05.032
Yeah, right.

27:05.136 --> 27:06.180
Stretford?

27:06.283 --> 27:07.118
No.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.514
Go on, then.

27:13.618 --> 27:14.905
Where do you want to be?

27:15.009 --> 27:18.102
I dunno.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.250
Maybe California.

27:19.355 --> 27:20.223
Writing novels?

27:20.328 --> 27:21.509
In a cabin by the ocean?

27:21.613 --> 27:22.970
Not a cabin.

27:23.074 --> 27:26.099
One of them steel and glass minimum houses.

27:26.203 --> 27:27.976
Yeah, Hollywood starlets hanging 'round the pool.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.610
Oh, defo.

27:29.714 --> 27:34.407
Dancing all day, plenty of weed, rubbing suncream on each other.

27:34.512 --> 27:36.284
Sounds like one of your stories.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.501
Yeah tanned and stoned.

27:37.605 --> 27:39.378
You know proper hard bodies.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.229
Easy you'll get me going.

27:42.334 --> 27:45.462
Well, wasted on you anyway.

27:45.566 --> 27:48.104
Don't know.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.147
Sounded good.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.963
You can't be totally frigid, then.

27:52.068 --> 27:55.092
Watch it!

27:55.196 --> 27:57.421
Well, you must be a bit.

27:57.524 --> 27:58.325
Why?

27:58.429 --> 28:00.793
Sex is overrated. You said it.

28:00.898 --> 28:02.079
Well it is.

28:02.183 --> 28:07.745
Better channeling the energy into work, or the gym.

28:07.850 --> 28:13.759
But what about orgasms?

28:13.864 --> 28:14.942
What about 'em?

28:15.046 --> 28:16.401
Ever had one?

28:16.505 --> 28:19.287
'Course!

28:19.392 --> 28:20.609
Reckon.

28:20.713 --> 28:23.285
You'd know if you had.

28:23.390 --> 28:25.649
I bet I can give you one.

28:25.754 --> 28:26.622
Watch it.

28:26.726 --> 28:28.535
No!

28:28.639 --> 28:31.280
I mean with this.

28:31.384 --> 28:32.671
This is me new one.

28:32.775 --> 28:33.748
Don't be mental.

28:33.853 --> 28:35.488
What? Don't you believe me?

28:35.592 --> 28:36.460
'Course not!

28:36.565 --> 28:37.400
Do you wanna bet?

28:40.841 --> 28:42.406
Won't it be embarrassing?

28:42.509 --> 28:43.379
No.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.490
Just chill and get in the mood.

28:53.147 --> 28:57.980
[interposing voices]

29:09.835 --> 29:12.823
Got to take such responsibilities seriously.

29:12.928 --> 29:15.465
You know, massive stakes!

29:15.570 --> 29:17.969
Someone's liberty here.

29:18.073 --> 29:21.619
Cost to the taxpayer of miscarriages of justice?

29:21.723 --> 29:23.044
It's astronomical.

29:26.208 --> 29:30.031
It's probably just thingy, your foreman.

29:36.810 --> 29:39.835
EDITH: The prosecution's adamant that almost every time they

29:39.939 --> 29:41.538
follow the chain of counterfeit goods,

29:41.642 --> 29:44.842
such as those football shirts, back to its source, it's,

29:44.945 --> 29:50.125
in some way, implicated into a much larger criminal framework

29:50.229 --> 29:53.671
invariably linked to drugs, guns,

29:53.775 --> 29:56.453
people smuggling, or terrorism!

29:56.557 --> 30:00.625
If that boss-eyed Mickey Mouser is al-Qaeda,

30:00.729 --> 30:02.953
then I'm, al--

30:03.057 --> 30:07.299
al-- alcohol-free.

30:07.402 --> 30:10.740
His name's Graeme McEwan.

30:10.844 --> 30:13.278
Well isn't it enough, then that our Graeme's

30:13.383 --> 30:18.319
admitted possession and selling snide gear?

30:18.423 --> 30:19.431
Eh?

30:19.536 --> 30:22.038
He'll get a hefty fine for that anyway.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.637
Rightly so!

30:23.741 --> 30:28.609
But, as he swears, isn't it possible that he was ripped off

30:28.713 --> 30:31.042
and didn't know the football shirts were fake?

30:31.147 --> 30:33.580
Would he risk openly selling them on Longsight Market

30:33.684 --> 30:37.543
if he honestly thought they were snide?

30:37.647 --> 30:40.638
I'll give Mr. McEwan ten years just for selling United kits,

30:40.742 --> 30:41.611
but hey, that's personal.

30:47.243 --> 30:51.866
[jurors cheer]

30:51.970 --> 30:54.578
MICKY: Her truncheon probed his balls,

30:54.683 --> 30:56.838
as he flicked his tongue through the black lace

30:56.942 --> 30:59.375
of her best La Senza knickers.

30:59.479 --> 31:02.677
Spread them, her deep voice whispered

31:02.782 --> 31:04.521
as she moved the handcuffs to allow him

31:04.625 --> 31:06.362
access to her youthful beast--

31:06.467 --> 31:12.585
tsk, spelling again-- youthful breasts, and moist loins.

31:12.690 --> 31:15.505
She grabbed the cell bars, trousers around her ankles,

31:15.610 --> 31:18.773
la senzas to the side, hat perched cheekily

31:18.877 --> 31:21.520
on her short brunette hair.

31:21.624 --> 31:23.188
The prisoner stood.

31:23.293 --> 31:26.560
Ten years of press ups giving him the body of an Adonis,

31:26.665 --> 31:29.933
a decade of yearning, and the fullest pair of bollocks

31:30.037 --> 31:31.984
she'd ever seen.

31:32.088 --> 31:35.356
That's really well put, Micky.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.345
He slapped her pert buttocks with enough force

31:38.450 --> 31:39.840
to hint a threat of pain.

31:39.944 --> 31:41.023
[carrie moans]

31:41.126 --> 31:43.629
He gazed at the window, dreaming of his release,

31:43.733 --> 31:45.229
and cried out in glory.

31:45.333 --> 31:46.201
Agh!

31:46.306 --> 31:48.045
Agh!

31:48.149 --> 31:52.633
And plunged his throbbing member deep and hard

31:52.737 --> 31:54.128
into the grateful copper.

32:00.003 --> 32:04.628
[carrie moaning]

32:11.823 --> 32:15.439
My fucking word!

32:15.543 --> 32:16.759
Language.

32:16.864 --> 32:17.872
Give me that.

32:20.931 --> 32:22.912
No!

32:23.017 --> 32:24.963
No!

32:25.068 --> 32:26.006
Hey!

32:26.110 --> 32:27.120
A double?

32:27.224 --> 32:28.093
Yes!

32:28.197 --> 32:29.135
No!

32:29.240 --> 32:31.047
See what I've started?

32:31.151 --> 32:33.133
Someone's nicking my boots!

32:49.368 --> 32:52.879
How long you been down here?

32:52.984 --> 32:55.104
I'm nicking ya!

32:55.208 --> 32:56.147
Oi!

32:56.251 --> 32:57.121
Oi!

33:05.185 --> 33:06.124
MADDY: One.

33:06.228 --> 33:07.203
Two.

33:07.306 --> 33:08.557
Three.

33:08.662 --> 33:09.913
Four.

33:10.017 --> 33:10.887
Five.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.243
She loves it here.

33:12.347 --> 33:13.702
I know she does.

33:13.807 --> 33:15.198
And I do, too.

33:15.302 --> 33:16.483
And it's a treat for us all.

33:16.589 --> 33:18.917
But it'd be different if it's permanent.

33:19.021 --> 33:20.030
Why would it?

33:20.134 --> 33:21.072
Why do you think that?

33:21.177 --> 33:23.055
It's about my confidence, too.

33:23.159 --> 33:25.140
Moving home would feel like moving backwards.

33:25.244 --> 33:27.434
You can't stay in that shit hole forever.

33:30.389 --> 33:33.345
That's why I'm moving in with Jamie.

33:33.449 --> 33:34.873
You can't!

33:34.977 --> 33:37.307
Won't just be treading water?

33:37.411 --> 33:38.802
I can help out and earn extra cash.

33:38.907 --> 33:40.923
At least it'll feel like I'm achieving something.

33:41.026 --> 33:42.070
We can help with money.

33:42.174 --> 33:43.391
I know you can, dad.

33:43.495 --> 33:46.033
But it's also about my independence.

33:46.137 --> 33:48.745
[knock on door]

33:48.849 --> 33:51.909
MIMI: A pub's a terrible environment to be

33:52.013 --> 33:53.681
bringing up a little girl.

33:53.785 --> 33:56.949
And what sort of example is that two-face slag

33:57.053 --> 33:58.062
going to be setting?

34:00.774 --> 34:02.928
Here you are, lad, 30 quid.

34:03.033 --> 34:06.475
Nice one.

34:06.579 --> 34:07.969
99.

34:08.074 --> 34:08.976
100!

34:09.081 --> 34:12.036
Coming, ready or not!

34:12.141 --> 34:13.949
It's the gray market.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.938
No one can tell what's fake anymore, 'cause it

34:17.043 --> 34:18.850
all comes from the same suppliers!

34:18.954 --> 34:21.179
You sound like a conspiracy theorist.

34:21.284 --> 34:23.752
Pardonnez-moi, who wouldn't be?

34:23.856 --> 34:25.560
Classic smokescreens.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.645
Diverting suspicion.

34:27.750 --> 34:28.862
Er, thingy's name.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.156
Er, Saint Bob.

34:31.261 --> 34:33.243
New album every Live Aid.

34:33.347 --> 34:34.667
Pro Bono.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.580
Always opposing those in charge?

34:36.684 --> 34:37.797
I bet you do better.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.578
Probably legalize drugs, prostitution.

34:40.683 --> 34:47.842
It isn't just Baghead Billy recording 50 DVDs at once.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.476
FRANK (VOICEOVER): Baghead Billy comes

34:49.581 --> 34:54.379
in the jockey with a rucksack of pirate DVDs every Saturday.

34:54.484 --> 34:57.716
Often the big boys are in on it

34:57.820 --> 34:59.454
so they can wholesale cheaper.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.924
I don't think legitimate companies would deal

35:02.028 --> 35:04.356
with gray-market manufacturers.

35:04.461 --> 35:06.825
Why, it's the same people!

35:06.929 --> 35:09.293
China, India, Philippines, Mexico.

35:09.397 --> 35:12.978
The lot, churned out of sweatshops.

35:13.082 --> 35:16.002
Little baby immigrants knitting their fingers

35:16.106 --> 35:21.147
to their widgies for ten pence a day to make your handbags.

35:21.251 --> 35:24.172
Globalization condemning billions

35:24.276 --> 35:28.655
to disability and potlessness.

35:28.761 --> 35:30.012
You're diverting attention.

35:30.116 --> 35:32.933
I am still to be convinced that Graeme McEwan

35:33.037 --> 35:35.123
isn't part of a wider team.

35:35.227 --> 35:37.451
I'm still to be convinced he is!

35:37.555 --> 35:38.808
OK.

35:38.912 --> 35:39.989
OK.

35:40.093 --> 35:42.944
Let's forget the free-trade conundrum

35:43.048 --> 35:46.038
and concentrate on poor Graeme.

35:46.142 --> 35:47.602
All right?

35:47.706 --> 35:52.400
He's admitted possessing and selling counterfeit goods

35:52.504 --> 35:54.556
and he will be punished.

35:54.659 --> 35:57.128
Regarding the bigger accusation, let's

35:57.232 --> 36:04.985
suppose that Graeme does know where the shirts came from.

36:05.089 --> 36:07.244
Even if he knew, does that mean he's

36:07.349 --> 36:11.938
closely involved in the workings of a bigger criminal network?

36:12.042 --> 36:13.397
The police say so.

36:13.501 --> 36:15.761
Picture the scene.

36:15.865 --> 36:20.803
The boss-eyed Scouser sells a fake shirt down the market

36:20.906 --> 36:23.132
another little immigrant.

36:23.236 --> 36:30.362
What if the punter also knows, deep down, that it is a fake?

36:33.283 --> 36:38.080
Isn't that some degree of culpability?

36:42.008 --> 36:44.650
Edith?

36:44.754 --> 36:46.075
I suppose.

36:46.179 --> 36:49.100
Wouldn't that imply, by extension,

36:49.204 --> 36:52.194
that the punter who buys the shirts off Boss-Eye,

36:52.298 --> 36:54.454
is also part of a bigger criminal network?

36:57.756 --> 37:01.302
What if the punter was a young woman who

37:01.407 --> 37:04.466
bought a pair of Gucci sunglasses

37:04.569 --> 37:06.030
and she only pays 20 quid for them,

37:06.134 --> 37:07.838
so there's no way she could have mistaken

37:07.942 --> 37:09.368
them for the real deal.

37:09.472 --> 37:14.894
Does it then follow that any of these regular punters,

37:14.999 --> 37:18.858
or any of us who've ever bought designer clothes, you know,

37:18.962 --> 37:24.490
like in a car boot, are we also members of a terrorist cell,

37:24.593 --> 37:26.749
or a Colombian cartel?

37:26.854 --> 37:29.392
Sex trafficking triads?

37:29.496 --> 37:32.903
The halting of which is a massive reason to legalize

37:33.007 --> 37:34.954
prostitution, by the way.

37:35.058 --> 37:38.882
Not forgetting the brand probably copied

37:38.986 --> 37:41.106
more than any other on the planet,

37:41.211 --> 37:43.958
the fake Louis Vuitton handbags.

37:46.947 --> 37:48.025
Oh!

37:48.130 --> 37:52.684
This is real, you stinking smart arse tramp!

38:04.920 --> 38:05.753
Hey.

38:10.378 --> 38:11.629
One condition.

38:18.304 --> 38:19.139
Not quite.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.284
That's two.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.496
HELEN: Let's vote again, then.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.408
All those who think Boss-Eye's innocent.

38:42.500 --> 38:48.723
One, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.113

38:50.217 --> 38:53.103
The Scouser's free!

38:53.207 --> 38:54.146
We're free!

38:54.250 --> 38:56.162
Whoa, whoa, hang on a minute.

38:56.266 --> 38:58.421
You know, it's coming back to me now.

38:58.526 --> 39:02.349
Something the prosecution mentioned.

39:02.454 --> 39:05.722
It's a niggling doubt.

39:05.826 --> 39:09.268
Oh, how stupid!

39:09.372 --> 39:11.840
Forgot all about it.

39:11.945 --> 39:13.753
I'm going to have to sleep on it.

39:13.857 --> 39:15.421
[jurors groan]

39:15.525 --> 39:18.202
Don't-- better not count mine, just yet.

39:18.307 --> 39:19.315
Abstained.

39:27.484 --> 39:29.014
What's got into you tonight?

39:47.473 --> 39:48.656
Read it to me.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.429
Why?

39:50.534 --> 39:51.611
Just read it to me.

40:19.213 --> 40:20.117
Come on.

40:26.895 --> 40:27.904

40:28.009 --> 40:28.843
Yeah.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.839
I've been thinking.

40:36.942 --> 40:38.193
Please, mum, I know you're unhappy

40:38.298 --> 40:40.280
but don't drag us down too.

40:40.384 --> 40:42.331
Made me mind up.

40:42.435 --> 40:44.382
It's OK.

40:44.486 --> 40:46.120
What is.

40:46.224 --> 40:47.093
Open it.

40:52.065 --> 40:53.663
Me mum handed it down.

40:53.769 --> 40:57.106
Bits and bobs from when I was growing up.

40:57.210 --> 41:00.755
And I created it on, with stuff from when you were a baby.

41:09.412 --> 41:11.915
I think it's time you started collecting for Katie.

41:18.069 --> 41:19.216
Right, here we go.

41:53.666 --> 41:57.108
Are you married, Frank?

41:57.212 --> 41:59.507
Yeah. Kind of.

41:59.611 --> 42:02.045
She might pop by later.

42:02.149 --> 42:02.810
You?

42:06.391 --> 42:07.920
Never get to see him, though.

42:08.025 --> 42:11.952
What, because of his long hours or your courtroom fetish?

42:12.056 --> 42:13.307
He's in Alabama.

42:13.413 --> 42:14.247
Oh, would be.

42:14.351 --> 42:15.499
Online romance?

42:15.602 --> 42:17.375
Just letters.

Ah, Billets deux.

42:19.044 --> 42:20.157
Traditional.

42:20.261 --> 42:21.443
Yeah, I'm all fingers and thumbs with computers.

42:21.547 --> 42:23.285
Oh, I can use one.

42:23.390 --> 42:24.293
So can Hank Jake.

42:24.397 --> 42:27.562
He's just not allowed to on death row.

42:31.177 --> 42:32.254
Isn't he handsome?

42:40.355 --> 42:41.572
What did he do?

42:41.676 --> 42:43.657
Butchered, barbecued and ate 24

But I know he's sorry now.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.694
You want another drink?

42:56.797 --> 42:59.232
I'm going for a candlelit vigil with the local church

42:59.335 --> 43:01.178
next month.

43:01.283 --> 43:03.194
Should get another postponement.

43:26.208 --> 43:27.042
No tears?

No painful adjustments of my reproductive organs

43:32.675 --> 43:35.942

43:36.046 --> 43:39.697
No, she's right, Pad, and you're right.

43:39.801 --> 43:42.722
They need to fly.

43:42.826 --> 43:45.016
And I've had enough.

Kids, that is.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.784
Aw!

43:54.888 --> 43:57.148
Aw!

43:57.252 --> 43:59.685
Look at you!

43:59.790 --> 44:00.833
Oh!

44:04.831 --> 44:07.091
Guess it must be the sense of danger.

44:07.195 --> 44:10.010
I just love the thrill of that threat.

44:10.115 --> 44:13.382
Certain men exude it.

44:13.487 --> 44:15.885
You exude it, Frank.

44:15.989 --> 44:20.371
You're intelligent, but I know you're unpredictable too.

44:20.474 --> 44:22.178
Thank you.

Excites me.

44:23.951 --> 44:28.366
Turns me on, not knowing what you're going to do next.

44:28.470 --> 44:30.348
Surprise me.

44:30.451 --> 44:34.137
Show me something dangerous.

44:34.241 --> 44:35.284
Like what.

44:35.389 --> 44:36.397
Anything, Frank.

Right here, right now.

Whether we're aware of it or not,

the fact is, unless we're asleep,

we're probably talking shit.

Stay.
