00:03.133 --> 00:05.092
<i>Previously on</i> East New York... Tamika, listen, uh,

00:05.222 --> 00:06.919
you open to the possibility
of having dinner one evening?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.660
I hired a new chef.
I don't want you doing

00:08.791 --> 00:09.835
a background check on him.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.098
I know there's things
in his past.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.316
I'm gonna have to ask you

00:12.447 --> 00:14.275
to turn in your
resignation immediately.

00:14.405 --> 00:15.667
You're so sure
of yourself.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.191
When there's something
to be sure about.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.648
Step back, step back.
I got this.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.611
Hey, you okay?
You all right?

01:29.741 --> 01:31.787
All right, wait. Take your
time, take your time.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.223
It's okay, it's okay.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.487
Mm.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.281
Hello?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.499
Officer Quinlan,
you need to suit up

01:48.630 --> 01:50.849
and report for duty at 0500.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.677
Okay, got it.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.986
What was that?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.466
I have to go in early.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.947
- How come?
- They didn't say.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.386
- I hope I don't get called in.
- Mm.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.348
Be quiet.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.577
$50 a head to get in,

02:22.707 --> 02:25.232
no alcohol, no food.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.668
Bring your own drugs?

02:26.798 --> 02:29.410
People do what they do.
I just don't get involved.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.585
What's your end?

02:30.715 --> 02:31.847
Exposure.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.849
There's dope people here, I DJ,

02:33.979 --> 02:35.372
they throw it on socials...

02:35.503 --> 02:37.722
I got 90,000 followers and...

02:37.853 --> 02:38.897
I'm just getting started.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.072
Wow.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.640
Who's that?

02:44.773 --> 02:46.340
Relax.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.646
- She's the precinct commander.
- I got called in

02:48.777 --> 02:50.431
by Operations on my way in.
What are we looking at?

02:50.561 --> 02:53.129
Four fatalities.
Looks like drug overdose.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.392
- Fentanyl, probably.
- Hmm.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.177
Whoa, excuse me, sir.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.482
You're gonna
have to step back.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.441
I got a call that
my girlfriend died.

03:00.571 --> 03:01.877
I just want to see her.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.401
I'm sorry, but you can't
do that right now.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.404
I can't see her?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.406
I'm sorry, not at this time.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.325
Who do you think
passed the bad dope?

03:15.456 --> 03:16.587
No idea.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.110
No, huh?

03:18.241 --> 03:20.330
I wasn't holding
and I wasn't looking, so...

03:20.461 --> 03:23.290
- I don't know.
- What about other people?

03:23.420 --> 03:24.508
I don't know about
other people.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.857
What was the vibe?
Were they

03:25.988 --> 03:27.816
doing cocaine, heroin,
ecstasy, what?

03:27.946 --> 03:29.687
I don't do drugs,
so I don't know.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.602
I'm a strict vegetarian.

03:31.733 --> 03:32.995
I have a daily practice of yoga

03:33.125 --> 03:34.301
and meditation and that is it.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.998
Why were you here?

03:36.128 --> 03:38.435
Just chilling with my boy,
DJ Authentic.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.350
You his friend,
bodyguard, what?

03:41.699 --> 03:43.048
Whatever he needs.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.354
This is an active crime scene.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.138
- I can't let anybody in.
- Excuse me.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.488
No, you're
gonna have to wait...

03:47.618 --> 03:48.750
- I know my daughter's in here.
- Sir.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.360
- Gwen.
- Sir!

03:51.361 --> 03:52.580
Gwen!

03:52.710 --> 03:54.886
Daddy, my friend died.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.105
It's okay,
- it's okay.
- Excuse me.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.150
Excuse me.
How did you get in here?

03:58.281 --> 04:00.849
Oh, this is my daughter.
- I need to take her home.
- Oh, unfortunately,

04:00.979 --> 04:02.981
your daughter's going to have
to stay here for a while.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.418
- It's-it's okay, Dad.
- No, no,

04:04.548 --> 04:05.636
no, no, it's not okay.

04:05.767 --> 04:06.681
Who are you?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.813
Deputy Inspector Regina Haywood.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.685
Which chief
do I have to get on the phone,

04:10.815 --> 04:14.428
Deputy Inspector Regina Haywood?
Because I know them all.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.429
Sir, she may have been
a witness.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.474
Frankly, she's
lucky to be alive.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.955
There are four
dead bodies here.

04:20.085 --> 04:22.044
This is a crime scene

04:22.174 --> 04:25.439
and the detectives need
to question everyone present.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.354
If you interfere
with my detectives

04:27.484 --> 04:29.921
I'll have you taken
out in handcuffs.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.404
I'm all over this, sweetie.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.101
And so's my lawyer.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.540
Take her phone.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.835
- How's your Italian coming?
- Not bad.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.533
I think I need
a little more practice.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.279
So, how are you feel about
your appointment?

05:23.410 --> 05:24.541
How do you think I feel?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.543
I don't understand
what the problem is.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.719
You like Dr. Feigenbaum,
you like his hygienist...

05:28.850 --> 05:31.243
- It's not that simple.
- It is that simple.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.506
You got your yearly check-up.

05:32.636 --> 05:33.550
And it's been almost five years

05:33.681 --> 05:36.205
- since you've gone.
- COVID years don't count.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.555
Come on, we've been
through this.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.864
I just don't want to
have to start going out

05:42.994 --> 05:45.475
- all the time.
- All the time?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.129
Honey, you haven't
left the house

05:47.259 --> 05:50.088
- in almost a month.
- This is about Italy,
isn't it?

05:50.219 --> 05:52.264
This is about the dentist.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.919
But yes,
I'd like you to build up

05:55.050 --> 05:57.400
to the point where
we can go to Italy together.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.488
I got all these vacation days

05:58.619 --> 06:00.229
I haven't taken
and I'd like to go.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.232
I don't know why it's so
important that we go somewhere.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.147
Aventine,

06:05.277 --> 06:06.844
Calea,

06:06.975 --> 06:09.586
Capitoline...

06:09.717 --> 06:11.762
Esquiline, Palatine...

06:11.893 --> 06:14.330
That's five.
There's seven hills in Rome.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.333
Quirinal and Viminal, okay?

06:19.857 --> 06:21.293
Thank you.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.167
I suppose I have
to get dressed

06:25.297 --> 06:27.909
to go to the dentist.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.127
You got five hours.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.826
No reason to hurry.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.785
I love you.

06:41.488 --> 06:45.361
Uh, it's CompStat.
you've been in them many times.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.928
Never as precinct commander.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.756
They're gonna ask you
questions about crime

06:48.886 --> 06:50.975
and what you're doing
to address it.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.281
I can handle it.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.630
What?

06:55.545 --> 06:57.112
What's weighing on you, Regina?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.114
Four dead kids.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.812
Oh. Yeah, I... I heard.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.074
We recovered the pills
from their pockets.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.599
They were yellow
and green and red, like

07:05.729 --> 07:07.252
M's or Skittles
or gummi...

07:07.383 --> 07:08.993
Like they were candy.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.256
You got to let
your detectives handle that.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.650
You got your hands full today.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.044
Oh, it's Padaro
doing the questioning.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.741
Yeah, who you worked with
in Narcotics.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.395
Who I like.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.875
He's gonna ask you
some tough questions, though,

07:21.005 --> 07:22.964
because he knows
that's what's expected of him,

07:23.094 --> 07:26.271
but, uh, there's no
hidden agenda. Not with him.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.840
Hey, you're prepared,
you're gonna fine.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.581
If there's one thing you
know about me, Chief,

07:31.712 --> 07:33.844
I always come prepared.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.672
Okay?

07:38.109 --> 07:40.982
Holly just moved here
from Ann Arbor.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.724
What drugs was she
- taking, Gwendolyn?
- We did some

07:43.854 --> 07:46.291
edibles before
we got there and then...

07:47.989 --> 07:50.644
...she decided
she wanted to do Ecstasy.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.124
Where'd she get it?

07:53.255 --> 07:55.605
There were a couple guys
hanging around the DJ.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.955
I think it was one of them.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.827
We need to take a look
at your phone.

07:59.957 --> 08:03.439
Your videos might be helpful.
Can you please unlock it?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.442
Gwen.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.497
We just wanted to go
someplace and dance.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.155
Corinne said the <i>Post</i>
has an article about the bar.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.463
Says it talks about
the $18 grilled cheese sandwich

08:27.594 --> 08:28.812
under the headline,
"There Goes

08:28.943 --> 08:30.901
the Neighborhood."If it's not open yet

08:31.032 --> 08:32.120
how are they writing
articles about it?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.643
They must've gotten
hold of a menu.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.689
Possible the
hospitality business

08:35.819 --> 08:37.517
is more complicated
than you thought.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.258
- What am I gonna do?
- Nothing.

08:40.389 --> 08:43.218
At least she's
getting press, right?

08:43.348 --> 08:45.350
Ooh!

08:56.361 --> 08:57.928
Whoa, whoa, back up.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.714
There, stop.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.108
That's Napoleon Santiago.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.328
I would have thought
- he'd be older.
- No,

09:06.458 --> 09:07.590
he's the next generation.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.331
The spitting image
of his father.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.941
According to Intelligence,
they're still in business.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.943
I could never get
anything to stick.

09:13.074 --> 09:13.901
I tried, boy.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.816
I chased them the whole time

09:15.946 --> 09:18.427
- I was in Narcotics.
- Mostly heroin, right?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.733
Also bootleg pharmaceuticals.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.343
You remember when
some people died

09:21.473 --> 09:23.084
from Xanax cut with fentanyl?

09:23.214 --> 09:24.738
That was the Santiagos
selling that.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.043
All right,
preliminary report from ME

09:26.174 --> 09:27.392
puts all four deaths

09:27.523 --> 09:29.177
on Ecstasy cut with fentanyl.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.353
That's definitely them 'cause
they dropped the price of heroin

09:31.483 --> 09:33.573
to the point where they were
practically giving it away.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.313
Enough people got strung out,

09:35.444 --> 09:36.793
they shoot the price back up

09:36.924 --> 09:39.579
and all these poor junkies,
they did what...

09:39.709 --> 09:42.886
whatever they had to do
to buy it.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.845
How'd they manage to
stay out of prison?

09:44.975 --> 09:46.716
Really good lawyers,
an overworked police department

09:46.847 --> 09:48.805
and-- let's face it--
I hate to say it, but...

09:48.936 --> 09:50.024
the people who were dying

09:50.154 --> 09:51.895
were mostly Black and brown.

09:52.026 --> 09:52.940
You hate to think
it makes a difference...

09:53.070 --> 09:54.768
Nevertheless, here we are
because it does.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.162
So, this time...

09:58.293 --> 10:00.643
I'm gonna take them down.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.443
Everyone in attendance
was questioned?

10:18.574 --> 10:21.838
What about commercial tenants
on the ground floor?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.361
And building maintenance--

10:23.492 --> 10:25.102
has there been any history

10:25.233 --> 10:27.583
of drug dealing
in nearby locations?

10:27.714 --> 10:28.671
And don't forget to ask...

10:28.802 --> 10:30.499
Oh, I got to go.
I got to go.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.675
Morning, everybody.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.634
We have Brooklyn North here

10:34.764 --> 10:36.548
for today's CompStat.
Let's get started.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.637
There's a lot to talk about.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.204
Deputy Inspector Haywood,

10:40.335 --> 10:42.076
7-4's up first.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.514
Good morning, Deputy Inspector.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.603
Good morning, Chiefs.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.083
You've had a drop
in burglaries,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
but a significant
increase in robberies.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.086
What are we doing
about that?

10:52.216 --> 10:55.350
I've analyzed my robbery
incidents by type,

10:55.480 --> 10:56.960
by location, by tour,

10:57.091 --> 10:58.875
by day of the week. I am
prepared to discuss

10:59.006 --> 11:01.835
- in detail.
- Let's stay on a macro level

11:01.965 --> 11:04.838
for right now. We can
dive into detail a little later.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.230
Uh, Chief, before
you go much further,

11:06.361 --> 11:08.668
would you mind if I interject
a couple of questions?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.801
- Not at all.
- Inspector, it's all

11:11.932 --> 11:13.847
well and good to talk about
what you're doing.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.979
I'd like to talk about
what you're not doing.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.677
I'm sure there are
a great many things

11:17.807 --> 11:19.069
that fall under that heading.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.290
According to my information,
you have decided

11:22.420 --> 11:25.162
to stop enforcing
quality-of-life crimes,

11:25.293 --> 11:26.337
is that right?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.904
That's not true
across the board.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.602
Is it true
partway across the board?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.387
As you know,

11:32.517 --> 11:33.780
police commanders

11:33.910 --> 11:35.651
can establish
their own priorities.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.523
And currently, at the 7-4.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.090
those things don't include

11:40.221 --> 11:42.571
selling loose cigarettes,
alcohol in public

11:42.702 --> 11:43.920
or going after vendors.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.531
Well, I'm just not clear
on where you think

11:46.662 --> 11:49.186
your authority to make
that determination comes from.

11:49.317 --> 11:53.234
Again, it's less of
an official policy

11:53.364 --> 11:56.454
and more so realignment
of priorities.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.108
Inspector, let's not play games.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.501
Whether you call it
a policy or priority,

11:59.631 --> 12:01.024
the effect is the same.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.331
And I want to know
under what departmental

12:03.461 --> 12:06.160
regulations do you derive the
authority to make that call?

12:06.290 --> 12:08.597
Chief, uh, I think I can
shed some light on that.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.207
With all due respect,
the answers today

12:10.338 --> 12:12.340
should be coming from
Inspector Haywood,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.255
- not from you.
- No, I understand that,
Chief Donaldson,

12:14.385 --> 12:17.084
but, uh, the realignment
of priorities

12:17.214 --> 12:19.303
wasn't arrived at
by Inspector Haywood.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.263
It came about through
extensive discussions--

12:22.393 --> 12:24.874
data-driven discussions,
I might add--

12:25.005 --> 12:26.441
that I specifically requested

12:26.571 --> 12:28.443
from all of my Brooklyn North commanders.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.271
But I am more than happy

12:30.401 --> 12:33.187
to answer whatever questions
you have, Chief Donaldson.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.500
What's the morale like
at the 7-4 these days?

12:42.631 --> 12:45.199
Oh, man.
Well, it varies depending on

12:45.329 --> 12:46.591
the day and the
individual officer

12:46.722 --> 12:47.810
that you're talking about.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.420
Would it surprise you
to learn that

12:49.551 --> 12:52.989
I've had conversations
with officers at the 7-4

12:53.120 --> 12:56.340
who tell me that morale
is at an all-time low?

12:56.471 --> 12:57.689
You know, Chief,
with all due respect,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.735
I'd say that was a cheap shot.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.041
Take it easy there,
Chief Suarez.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.260
You and I, we can
walk into any precinct

13:03.391 --> 13:05.567
in this city right now
and we can find cops

13:05.697 --> 13:07.308
who claim that morale is bad,

13:07.438 --> 13:08.831
are unhappy or they're

13:08.962 --> 13:10.224
pissed off and some of them have

13:10.354 --> 13:11.616
good reason and
some of them don't.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.575
But we don't call the commanding
officers on the carpet

13:13.705 --> 13:15.272
and make them answer

13:15.403 --> 13:16.883
- for that!
- I want to stress

13:17.013 --> 13:20.321
that I am
perfectly willing to do so.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.672
Deputy Inspector, I'm
guessing that with the four

13:23.803 --> 13:24.760
drug overdoses
this morning,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.936
you have more
pressing matters

13:27.067 --> 13:28.068
to attend to.
I'm going to adjourn

13:28.198 --> 13:30.244
this meeting until 5:00
this afternoon.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.551
Hopefully that will allow
the temperature in the room

13:33.682 --> 13:36.119
to come down a few degrees.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.175
<i>Why are they</i>

13:48.305 --> 13:49.567
making me out
to be a bad person?

13:49.698 --> 13:51.134
Because they can.

13:51.265 --> 13:54.442
Okay? Because
it sells newspapers.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.270
Listen, I got to go.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.315
We had four drug
fatalities last night.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.014
It's always something
with you, isn't it?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.364
I can't take
a day off, Corinne.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.105
Yeah, me neither.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.455
Look, I am really stressed
about this.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.239
I need some advice
on how to deal with it.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.286
Well, what does
the ex-felon say?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.288
Are you just always
gonna call him that?

14:14.418 --> 14:16.464
What would you like
for me to call him?

14:16.594 --> 14:20.337
- George. That is his name.
- That is his name.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.688
Okay, um, look, if I catch
a break around dinnertime,

14:23.819 --> 14:24.385
I'll-I'll come back.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.474
Whatever.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.084
Corinne, I have to go.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.000
So go. Just go to your
drug fatalities.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.569
Wow.
You're mean.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.702
Tommy...

14:45.536 --> 14:48.800
Now is not the best time
for us to talk about it.

14:48.931 --> 14:49.976
Well, whether it is

14:50.106 --> 14:53.501
or it is not, Inspector...

14:53.631 --> 14:55.198
Hey, Chief.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.418
...now is the time
we're gonna talk about it.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.116
- You knew I was prepared.
- You <i>were</i> prepared.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.292
You were prepared
for legitimate questions.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
You weren't prepared
for Donaldson

15:04.077 --> 15:05.861
trying to make
some kind of audition tape

15:05.992 --> 15:07.384
- for the mayor.
- What does that mean?

15:07.515 --> 15:09.125
Donaldson,

15:09.256 --> 15:12.346
maneuvering to be
chief of department.

15:12.476 --> 15:16.089
He wants to be looked at
as, uh, old-school and-and tough

15:16.219 --> 15:18.743
and paint me to be
some kind of woke

15:18.874 --> 15:21.094
- diversity hire.
- You?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.922
He sees me as his rival.
He goes after you

15:23.052 --> 15:24.227
hoping that
I'm gonna jump in

15:24.358 --> 15:26.273
and then...
he got both of us.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.840
That being the case, maybe
it would have been better

15:28.971 --> 15:30.842
if you hadn't jumped in.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.150
- He pissed me off!
- All right.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.065
Well, then, maybe next time

15:36.196 --> 15:38.372
you let me handle it
for the both of us.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.248
- I will try to remember that.
- All right.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.256
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.346
- You know what drill music is?
- Yes, I do.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.741
It's a form of hip-hop
that references violence

15:59.871 --> 16:02.222
and criminal behavior... Stan, I said
I know what it is.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.485
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's...

16:04.615 --> 16:07.183
I'm listening to the playlist
from DJ Authentic

16:07.314 --> 16:10.534
from, uh, last night
at the loft party.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.928
And what really stood out
is that the lyrics mention

16:13.059 --> 16:15.278
drug dealing locations.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.586
They've been doing that
for a while, Stan.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.718
Oh, well, forgive me.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.459
I've never been in Narcotics,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.635
but I'd never realized
the specificity of it.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.942
Listen, like these,
uh, uh, playgrounds

16:27.073 --> 16:27.812
on Pennsylvania Avenue,

16:27.943 --> 16:29.597
a bo-bodega on Myrtle,

16:29.727 --> 16:33.383
Wyckoff Brewery, uh... What about the Wyckoff Brewery?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.081
Uh, there's, um...

16:35.211 --> 16:37.387
"N-word"-- I'm not gonna
say the word out loud--Right.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.736
"N-word, nothing
you can do to me,

16:38.867 --> 16:40.477
"I got my plug working at

16:40.608 --> 16:42.784
the Wyckoff Brewery."The Wyckoff Brewery

16:42.914 --> 16:44.481
used to be owned by

16:44.612 --> 16:47.093
one of the associates
of the Santiagos.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.878
I want the sector cars
to pay special attention

16:50.009 --> 16:51.749
to the area around there.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.055
Maybe we catch 'em dirty.

16:53.186 --> 16:56.537
- Yeah. Yeah, will do.
- Hey, Stan.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.191
That's good work.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.237
Yeah, okay.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.377
<i>You're meeting Tamika</i>

17:10.507 --> 17:12.074
- at Goody's?
- When she asked

17:12.205 --> 17:13.684
if I could make it lunch
instead of dinner,

17:13.815 --> 17:15.512
I got flustered, I didn't
have time to think.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
Why, you got a strong opinion
on where I should take her?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.602
I guess it doesn't matter.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.604
- No, it matters.
- Can you change it?

17:20.735 --> 17:22.302
That'd be worse.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.175
I-I...You'll be all right.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.743
I know I'm gonna be
all right, but-but...

17:28.873 --> 17:30.440
you think I'm low-balling her
taking her to Goody's?

17:33.965 --> 17:36.533
That Bronco was outside
of the loft party this morning.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.405
And now it's a block away
from Wyckoff Brewery--

17:38.535 --> 17:39.971
fancy that.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.671
All right, Marvin,
what are we stopping them for?

17:44.715 --> 17:46.717
<i>I don't know, Andre, you're
the one with all the ideas.</i>

17:46.848 --> 17:49.024
<i>What do you suggest?</i>

17:53.028 --> 17:55.552
- Take it light, man.
- Aiight.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.862
Why you pulling us over, man?

18:00.992 --> 18:02.168
You got tinted
license plate covers.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.865
Think you can thwart
the red light camera

18:03.995 --> 18:05.519
with impunity?

18:06.563 --> 18:08.130
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.958
It's not why you're pulling us
over, man. This is harassment

18:10.089 --> 18:12.700
- now, bro.
- Any drugs, guns, any weapons
in the car, Authentical?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.528
It's Authentic.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.965
It's DJ Authentic.
And no,

18:17.096 --> 18:17.792
there's nothing
in this car--

18:17.922 --> 18:19.185
no guns,

18:19.315 --> 18:20.142
no drugs,
no weapons,

18:20.273 --> 18:22.405
- Nothing.
- Hold up.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.364
Actually, I work
security for him.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.193
I'm licensed
to carry.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.455
Do you have
the gun on you?

18:28.585 --> 18:30.239
It's in the glove compartment.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.762
What are you doing, man?

18:31.893 --> 18:34.025
Go ahead and step out
of the vehicle for me, man.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.679
- What?
- I'm gonna need you to step out
of the vehicle for me. Now.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.420
- Get your boy, man.
- Taking my seat belt off.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.161
- Step out of the car.
- I'm taking my seat belt off.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.641
Now you. Hands
on the wheel.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.251
- Hands on the wheel.
- All right, all right, all right.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.514
- You stay.
- Right up here,
to the side.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.516
Keep your hands right there.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.391
- Where's the permit?
- I don't have it

18:51.521 --> 18:54.002
- with me.
- Out of the car.
Out of the car.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.177
Hands on the hood.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.787
Hands on the hood.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.050
♪ Elevator up, yeah. ♪

19:03.794 --> 19:04.969
Grounds for the stop?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.928
Use of illegal
license plate covers.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.408
Hey, gorgeous.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.369
You DJ'd last night.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.328
I did.
Did you enjoy it?

19:16.851 --> 19:19.245
How are the Santiagos
doing these days?

19:19.375 --> 19:20.681
No idea.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.770
But I got a gig
next week in Brooklyn

19:22.900 --> 19:24.250
and I want you to come.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.034
Just bring
your cuffs.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.433
This guy.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.959
I'm gonna take you back here
with the rest of comedians,

19:38.089 --> 19:39.352
see how tough you are then.

19:41.919 --> 19:45.096
So you're pretty tight
with Napoleon Santiago.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.837
I'm tight with
all types of people.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.491
Including the Santiago Family?

19:48.622 --> 19:50.537
I'm tight with
all types of people.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.409
The gun charge alone
will send you away for a year.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.846
Unless there's drugs
in the Bronco.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.283
And if it's fentanyl,

19:57.413 --> 19:59.372
it'll be a lot longer than that.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.025
<i>Yeah, the Santiago Family</i>

20:01.156 --> 20:04.333
was dealing heroin
when I was still in uniform.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.292
Now, 'cause
it's cheaper,

20:06.422 --> 20:08.032
they're in
the fentanyl business.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.556
What's that got to do with me?

20:09.686 --> 20:11.427
The only drugs you gonna find
are the ones

20:11.558 --> 20:12.776
- you put in there.
- <i>In other words,</i>

20:12.907 --> 20:14.256
it doesn't bother you.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.519
You work for the Santiagos?

20:16.650 --> 20:17.912
The Santiagos?

20:18.042 --> 20:18.913
Why would it?

20:19.043 --> 20:21.350
I work for DJ Authentic.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.438
What do you think
it's gonna do for your career

20:22.569 --> 20:24.223
to be associated with them?

20:24.353 --> 20:27.138
You want to book him for a
dance party or a wedding...

20:27.269 --> 20:28.227
Oh, you worried about my career?

20:28.357 --> 20:29.924
...quinceañera,
bat mitzvah?

20:30.968 --> 20:32.492
Just give me the dates,
I'll see what I can do.

20:32.622 --> 20:35.016
If I was you, I'd be worried.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.322
Worried about what?

20:36.452 --> 20:37.975
<i>That we find out you were doing</i>

20:38.106 --> 20:39.455
<i>more than just spinning
records last night.</i>

20:41.022 --> 20:43.111
That's all I was doing there.

20:44.634 --> 20:48.377
A boss is here from
DEA, Inspector.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.775
Inspector. Arliss Gruen,

20:54.905 --> 20:57.038
special agent in charge,
Drug Enforcement Administration.

20:57.168 --> 21:00.302
- How do you do?
- I understand

21:00.433 --> 21:01.651
you had
four fatalities

21:01.782 --> 21:04.001
- last night.
- All under the age of 20.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.830
Three were in college,
one just graduated.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.397
Well, given what's on
the street, it's a safe bet

21:08.528 --> 21:09.703
they were all from fentanyl.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.531
We got hold of a recording
that shows a member

21:11.661 --> 21:13.184
of the Santiago Family present.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.882
I'm guessing... We know all about
the Santiagos.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.537
Their operations don't extend
much beyond Brooklyn.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.495
Their operations
were responsible

21:19.626 --> 21:21.018
for the deaths
of four young people

21:21.149 --> 21:23.064
who had their entire future... I have no objection

21:23.194 --> 21:25.675
to you going after the Santiagos
for that at some point.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.156
I would just ask you,
hold off for the present.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.723
Why is that?

21:29.853 --> 21:32.160
Because we're going after
a Mexican drug cartel

21:32.291 --> 21:35.294
which, in all likelihood,
was responsible for bringing

21:35.424 --> 21:36.338
the fentanyl into
the United States

21:36.469 --> 21:38.122
and supplying the Santiagos.

21:38.253 --> 21:41.212
It's possible one of
the Santiagos could be flipped.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.910
I don't need them to flip.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.913
I've got an undercover
that's gotten close to them.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.871
Sean Dryden.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.439
Your cops arrested him
on a traffic stop.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.268
If your agent's gotten
close to the Santiagos,

21:53.399 --> 21:54.791
we can bring them down

21:54.922 --> 21:59.013
- without blowing his cover.
- My sights are set on way

21:59.143 --> 22:01.624
bigger targets than the
Santiagos, Inspector.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.061
Now I need
my undercover released

22:04.192 --> 22:05.541
and I need your assurance

22:05.672 --> 22:06.760
that you're gonna hold off
on anything else.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.980
I'll take care of releasing
your undercover,

22:10.111 --> 22:12.896
but four people were killed
in my precinct this morning,

22:13.027 --> 22:15.812
and there's no way in hell
I'm holding off.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.031
You're not gonna make me go
over your head,

22:17.161 --> 22:18.511
now, are you, Inspector?

22:18.641 --> 22:20.948
You can go wherever you want.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.176
Here's the thing, Sean.

22:32.307 --> 22:35.484
With four dead bodies,
there's gonna be prosecutions.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.312
There's also gonna be deals.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.315
Once the D.A. has
what he needs to convict,

22:40.446 --> 22:41.882
no more deals.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.493
Would you mind
stepping out for a moment?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.584
Sure.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.947
I just had a visit
from Arliss Gruen.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.515
Who's that?

23:06.646 --> 23:09.475
It's okay, Agent Dryden--
or whatever your name is--

23:09.605 --> 23:11.477
I've been fully briefed.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.266
Gruen always gets
his people out.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.660
You saw those four kids die
last night, right?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.313
Mm-hmm.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.447
Gruen's asking that I not go
after those responsible.

23:25.578 --> 23:26.970
Yeah.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.668
he wants to take down
a cartel in Sinaloa

23:28.798 --> 23:30.409
so he can have a photo op

23:30.539 --> 23:32.019
- on the border.
- What about you?
what do you want?

23:32.149 --> 23:34.413
I don't usually get asked that.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.676
But since you're asking...

23:37.807 --> 23:39.635
...I want to get the hell
out of undercover world.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.028
How long's it been?

23:41.158 --> 23:43.117
- Two and a half years.
- That's a long time

23:43.247 --> 23:45.032
to be somebody
- other than yourself.
- Long enough

23:45.162 --> 23:47.730
for you to forget
who yourself even is.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.341
How is it that
bodyguarding a DJ

23:50.472 --> 23:52.735
gets you so close
to the Santiagos?

23:55.521 --> 23:58.088
The Santiagos
move a lot of drugs

23:58.219 --> 23:59.046
in the party circuit.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.961
In clubs.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.615
How do you think
they get the drugs in there?

24:02.745 --> 24:04.921
Right.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.533
They never check the DJ.Mm-hmm.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.536
Put it in the DJ cases
and they wave you right in.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.583
Well, I don't take my orders

24:14.714 --> 24:16.455
from Special Agent
in Charge Gruen,

24:16.585 --> 24:18.761
so I will be going
after the Santiagos

24:18.892 --> 24:19.936
because the people
who were killed

24:20.067 --> 24:21.590
were killed in East New York.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.462
But best of luck to you
in Sinaloa.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.638
We're not busting
any cartels in Sinaloa.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.118
We don't have the assets
to take them on.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.338
There's no coordination with
the Mexican law enforcement.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.948
It's a mess.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.429
So you're walking away from
a bust you could pull off

24:34.560 --> 24:36.866
in favor of one
that you can't?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.694
It's not my decision.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.610
So, then don't worry about it.

24:41.741 --> 24:44.439
Hey, I watched
those four kids die.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.136
you think that didn't
have an effect on me?

24:46.267 --> 24:48.138
I don't know.
- I don't know you.
- Well, it did, okay?

24:48.269 --> 24:50.010
So it did.
So what?

24:50.140 --> 24:53.448
So maybe we can team up.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.717
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

25:01.848 --> 25:03.545
How'd the preparations
for the dentist go?

25:03.676 --> 25:04.546
FRANCINE [over phone]:
Good.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.243
I'm in the car.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.202
Excellent.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.160
The car service sent one
of those big luxurious cars,

25:10.291 --> 25:12.032
even though I didn't
ask for it.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.599
Good. Good.
Enjoy it.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.862
We're on Northern Boulevard,

25:15.992 --> 25:17.864
just passing Villa Roma.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.736
Really? So you left early, huh?

25:20.867 --> 25:22.433
You always tell me,
if you get places early,

25:22.564 --> 25:24.479
you don't have to worry
about being late.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.960
I'm proud of you, Francine.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.137
I know this is hard for you.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.008
And I really appreciate
your listening to me

25:32.139 --> 25:33.488
'cause it's, it's important.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.317
I'll see you when you get home.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.362
Okay, I love you.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.625
Love you.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.594
<i>I want your blessing, Chief.</i>

25:52.725 --> 25:54.074
Do I get to know for what?

25:54.204 --> 25:57.077
The fentanyl that's been
flooding the streets,

25:57.207 --> 25:59.688
that's responsible for
those four dead kids,

25:59.819 --> 26:01.734
has the Santiagos'
fingerprints all over it.

26:01.864 --> 26:02.909
And you feel like you got
enough for a collar?

26:03.039 --> 26:04.301
I wouldn't have thought so

26:04.432 --> 26:05.825
until I found out
there's an undercover

26:05.955 --> 26:07.174
that's gotten close
to Napoleon Santiago.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.045
- One of ours?
- DEA.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.310
- Will they loan him out?
- The SAC said no.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.269
That's generally
a jurisdictional call, Regina.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.575
I know that.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.315
And ordinarily I'd
leave it at that.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.882
I'd say <i>occasionally</i>
you'd leave it at that.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.538
I was thinking the UC could

26:23.669 --> 26:25.801
call in a tip and...

26:28.108 --> 26:30.414
No heads-up to the DEA?

26:30.545 --> 26:32.460
- No heads-up to anybody?
- Right.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.288
You'd be out on a limb,
you know that.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.986
The thought that we were able
to take them down and didn't

26:37.117 --> 26:39.641
is a little too hard to bear.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.295
I also don't expect you

26:41.425 --> 26:43.645
to bail me out
if this goes south. Oh,

26:43.776 --> 26:45.299
I know from this morning that's
the last thing that you'd want.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.780
Thank you, Chief.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.957
CompStat resumes at 5:00,
so don't be late.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.959
For what it's worth,
the morale at the 7-4...

26:53.089 --> 26:54.874
Let's not get into that
right now.

27:00.749 --> 27:04.187
How come you wanted to make it
lunch instead of dinner?

27:05.754 --> 27:07.538
Dinner seemed too much
like a date.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.540
And you didn't want to go
on a date with me?

27:09.671 --> 27:11.499
No, I didn't.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.895
I guess lunch is an event
of a lesser order.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.201
Doesn't carry any
romantic expectations.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.638
- Mm-hmm.
- I think they even have

27:19.768 --> 27:20.987
a dating service called

27:21.117 --> 27:22.249
It's Just Lunch.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.598
I've seen
the commercials.

27:23.729 --> 27:24.860
Did you ever use
one of those?

27:24.991 --> 27:26.993
No, I never did.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.951
I never did neither.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.347
We're from a different
generation, Marvin.

27:33.477 --> 27:36.655
We like to screw up
our relationships in person.

27:38.308 --> 27:39.701
Is that what I did?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.098
Not just you.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.795
We both did.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.538
I guess if we were
to try it again,

27:50.669 --> 27:52.192
we'd probably screw it up
again, wouldn't we?

27:52.322 --> 27:55.238
Probably.

27:55.369 --> 27:58.589
But that's not a reason
not to give it a try.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.549
Can we... Hey, Marvin.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.812
Uh, sorry, can I talk
to you a second?

28:05.248 --> 28:06.336
Sure...

28:08.556 --> 28:09.296
Excuse me.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.085
They've been putting
those on light poles.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.000
They won't even
give me a chance.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.220
- When is your opening?
- Two weeks.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.700
Then put your head down
and get it done.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.397
They'll see you're not
going anywhere.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.485
Some people'll come around,
and some of them won't.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.009
I'm afraid Tommy won't.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.098
He's so mad at me.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.404
Tommy mad at
a lot of people.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.233
He just caught me
at a bad moment,

28:33.363 --> 28:35.539
but... now he won't even
pick up the phone.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.150
He'll get over it.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.152
He'd be crazy not to.

28:39.282 --> 28:43.069
♪ I'll be super fine,
fine, fine. ♪

28:43.199 --> 28:44.635
Hey.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.594
What are you doing
out here?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.335
Marvin's having lunch
with his old girlfriend.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.902
Okay, what?

28:50.032 --> 28:53.383
You couldn't eat
on the same premises?

28:54.515 --> 28:57.605
He thought it would be
awkward to have me in there

28:57.736 --> 28:58.954
but not sitting with them,

28:59.085 --> 29:00.042
so he was going
back and forth in his head

29:00.173 --> 29:01.043
about where I should sit

29:01.174 --> 29:02.218
in relation to where

29:02.349 --> 29:03.480
the two of them
would be sitting.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.395
So I decided I would
just eat outside.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.483
All right.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.877
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna...

29:09.008 --> 29:12.141
I'm gonna go sit inside
'cause you two are crazy.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.447
Hey.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.772
We've made it look like both

29:33.902 --> 29:35.861
you and DJ Authentic

29:35.991 --> 29:37.253
were released on your own recognizance.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.951
What time can you set
the meeting for?

29:39.081 --> 29:40.561
How's 3:00?

29:40.691 --> 29:42.345
Good.

29:42.476 --> 29:46.393
Once you're there,
if there are narcotics present--

29:46.523 --> 29:48.961
and only if you see
that they're present--

29:49.091 --> 29:50.484
you're to signal
your backup.

29:50.614 --> 29:53.487
At that point, we'll have
probable cause to go in.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.184
You used to be in Narcotics.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.360
You look me up?

29:57.491 --> 29:59.188
Of course.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.537
You didn't look me up?

30:05.020 --> 30:06.326
You can tell your boss

30:06.456 --> 30:09.024
at the DEA that you were
with the Santiagos

30:09.155 --> 30:11.026
as part of your
normal undercover work,

30:11.157 --> 30:14.073
but that may well get
you jammed up anyway.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.726
Wouldn't be the first time
I've been jammed up.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.076
You could get fired.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.599
Wouldn't be the first time
I've been fired.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.602
The detectives know
the signal to go in

30:21.732 --> 30:23.343
and they've gone over
the location.

30:23.473 --> 30:27.042
- So we're set.
- See you on the other side.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.088
Of course I did.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.090
What's that?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.441
Looked you up.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.203
- Like my new whip, bro?
- It's all right. It's just...

30:57.333 --> 30:59.553
- a little regular.
- Regular?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.729
I'm about to put
35-inch Forgies on it,

31:01.860 --> 31:05.385
monster tires, and I'm-a
light it up with lights.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.039
That gonna attract
a lot of attention?

31:07.169 --> 31:09.302
That's what
you thinking about?

31:09.432 --> 31:11.695
- You weird, bro.
- Yeah, you <i>are</i> weird.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.219
Like, why you told them cops
there was a gun

31:13.349 --> 31:14.568
in the glove
compartment?

31:14.698 --> 31:16.178
Would it have been better
if they found it

31:16.309 --> 31:17.701
when they searched
- the car?
- Nah, nah, nah. There was

31:17.832 --> 31:19.616
no grounds to search
that car, man.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.576
They can always find grounds
if they want to.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.534
You know he does yoga.
He's a vegetarian.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.362
I ain't no punk, if
that's what you're assuming.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.061
I didn't say you was a punk.
I just said you a square.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.889
But you nice with the hammer.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.891
But why you let that cop
get to you like that?

31:33.021 --> 31:34.980
Did they already
get to you?

31:37.765 --> 31:38.897
You kidding me?

31:39.985 --> 31:41.116
I mean,
think about it.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.857
He acts like a cop so much,

31:42.988 --> 31:44.163
he can't be a cop.
You know what I'm saying?

31:44.293 --> 31:46.339
Like,
let's be serious.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.776
You know what,
I ain't even trippin'.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.647
'Cause if I thought someone
was working with the cops,

31:50.778 --> 31:53.520
I'd have so much fentanyl
stuffed down your throat,

31:53.650 --> 31:55.304
you'd be dead
before you hit the floor.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.523
Ain't even that, though.

31:56.653 --> 31:57.916
He's family.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.004
He's the bro.
He's good.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.309
That's-that'smy bro.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.571
- Thank you, king.
- Roll with you.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.095
That's good.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.366
Go time.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.033
Yo, Authentic, you're
doing real good, man.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.730
I'm about to make
a lot of money.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.644
They really think Julius
Randle's gonna save New York.

32:30.774 --> 32:31.950
That's crazy.

32:33.734 --> 32:34.691
NYPD!

32:34.822 --> 32:36.128
Police! Don't move!

32:36.258 --> 32:37.868
Hands
in the air!

32:47.008 --> 32:48.314
Hands up!

32:50.098 --> 32:51.056
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

32:54.581 --> 32:55.930
Don't move!

32:56.061 --> 32:57.932
Hands where
I can see 'em.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.586
Detective.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.948
Hands where
- I can see 'em.
- Turn around.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.351
I remember when you
were just a kid.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.135
Wait,

33:27.266 --> 33:29.181
were you one of the cops that
tried to lock up my old man?

33:29.311 --> 33:31.705
Your old man, your brother
Kiki, your cousins...

33:31.835 --> 33:34.838
Yeah, you ain't have much luck
with any of 'em, did you?

33:34.969 --> 33:37.102
I got you, Napoleon.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.149
And they next.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.734
<i>So,</i>

34:00.864 --> 34:03.345
you're running your own personal
police department, Inspector?

34:03.476 --> 34:04.607
We had an opportunity
to shut down

34:04.738 --> 34:06.870
a major source of a drug that is

34:07.001 --> 34:07.784
killing people.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.134
I wouldn't waste it.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.874
An undercover calls in
a tip, because why?

34:11.005 --> 34:12.702
There's drugs in plain sight.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.356
What, that's the first time
there were drugs in plain sight?

34:14.487 --> 34:16.750
Maybe it had something to do
with the investigation

34:16.880 --> 34:19.361
of four fatalities
this morning.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.668
Those four fatalities
were none of his business.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.017
And I don't mind telling you,

34:23.148 --> 34:24.366
Agent Dryden
is in a world of hurt.

34:24.497 --> 34:26.238
Agent Dryden lent
his assistance,

34:26.368 --> 34:27.326
took the risk

34:27.456 --> 34:28.327
in apprehending

34:28.457 --> 34:29.719
those responsible.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.547
Seems to me he would
be deserving of praise.

34:31.678 --> 34:35.247
I think the DEA will determine
what we do with Agent Dryden,

34:35.377 --> 34:36.422
without your input.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.641
I don't get what
you feel you lost.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.600
Dryden hasn't
blown his cover.

34:40.730 --> 34:43.037
He was arrested
along with everyone else.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.605
Agent Dryden is my asset,

34:45.735 --> 34:46.736
not yours.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.869
He belongs to me.

34:48.999 --> 34:52.090
That's what this is about--

34:52.220 --> 34:54.004
who gets to give the order.

34:54.135 --> 34:57.399
Who stands where at
the press conference.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.273
It's a big, wide world
out there, Inspector.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.057
It's a damn shame
you just don't see that.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.712
No. I do see it, Agent Gruen.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.583
And East New York
is a part of it.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.803
And it's a damn shame
that you can't see at all.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.196
Have a nice day.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.728
This wasn't the one
to be late for.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.817
Well, it couldn't be helped.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.907
Donaldson's looking for some
kind of, uh, act of contrition.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.910
Or as close
as you can come to it.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.304
Okay.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.481
Excuse me. Thank you.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.222
Excuse me.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.920
I'm clocking you in

35:40.050 --> 35:41.487
at 14 minutes late, Inspector.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.838
At the point
at which we left off,

35:44.968 --> 35:47.188
you were saying
that morale wasn't a problem,

35:47.319 --> 35:49.669
that disregarding enforcement

35:49.799 --> 35:52.628
of qualify-of-life regulations
was your prerogative.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.848
And since then,
it has come to my attention

35:54.978 --> 35:57.067
that you disregarded

35:57.198 --> 35:59.200
the explicit directive

35:59.331 --> 36:01.202
of the Special Agent
in Charge

36:01.333 --> 36:03.552
of an undercover operation
for the DEA.

36:03.683 --> 36:06.947
I wouldn't say I disregarded
it as much as I...

36:07.077 --> 36:09.036
felt the need
to take circumstances

36:09.167 --> 36:10.429
under consideration.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.039
Do you recognize
the need for good order

36:12.170 --> 36:13.345
and discipline, Inspector?

36:13.475 --> 36:15.260
- Yes, I do.
- Just so long
as you get

36:15.390 --> 36:15.912
- what you want.
- So long

36:16.043 --> 36:17.175
as it serves and protects

36:17.305 --> 36:18.698
the people in my precinct.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.309
Well, tell me, just
how does your version

36:21.440 --> 36:24.182
of good order and discipline
do that?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.316
A raid was conducted
this afternoon

36:28.447 --> 36:30.579
by the Drug Enforcement Administration,

36:30.710 --> 36:34.714
acting in coordination with
the detectives from the 7-4.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.455
Arrests were made.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.153
280 pounds

36:39.284 --> 36:42.461
of fentanyl pills and
powder were confiscated.

36:42.591 --> 36:46.334
I believe that the
success of the operation

36:46.465 --> 36:48.336
was a direct result

36:48.467 --> 36:52.035
of good order and discipline.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.347
Well done, Inspector.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.871
- Thank you, Chief.
- Outstanding
work, Inspector.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.264
Thank you.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.271

would sign up

37:53.401 --> 37:54.750
and I'd teach 'em
kitchen skills.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.709
You'd be their mentor,
in other words.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.624
There could be other
people mentoring as well.

37:58.754 --> 38:02.192
Yeah. Corinne or... you
could pick the people.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.978
What would you be
- mentoring them in, George?
- He said

38:05.108 --> 38:06.719
kitchen skills.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.462
You think I'm recruiting 'em
to do break-ins, Detective?

38:10.592 --> 38:11.941
It's occurred to me.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.378
If I were looking
to do break-ins,

38:13.508 --> 38:15.510
I wouldn't need
to recruit anybody.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.252
I already know people
who are good at it.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.819

maybe I can help people
