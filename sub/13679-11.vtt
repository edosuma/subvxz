JENNIFER: <i>The police believe</i>

00:06.994 --> 00:10.228
the Silver Bells
Killer had an accomplice.

00:10.230 --> 00:12.364
<i>He did.</i>

00:12.366 --> 00:15.967
BRADY: If you're willing to
come clean, tell the entire truth

00:15.969 --> 00:18.837
<i>about your role in the
Silver Bells killings,</i>

00:18.839 --> 00:21.539
that would be an
incredible showing of good faith.

00:21.541 --> 00:24.009
Listen, I need to get out of here now.

00:24.011 --> 00:25.644
I'm gonna be a father.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.012
BRADY: <i>I don't think Mitchell</i>

00:27.014 --> 00:29.014
<i>ever did actually own the knife.</i>

00:29.016 --> 00:30.282
I think it was Garrett's all along.

(loud grinding)

01:29.642 --> 01:31.476
Don't move!

01:42.455 --> 01:45.223
We need to talk.

01:45.225 --> 01:47.559
We know you've been lying to us.

01:47.561 --> 01:49.794
We talked to your old boyfriend.

01:49.796 --> 01:52.464
The body on the stairs wasn't him.

01:52.466 --> 01:55.333
(panting)

01:55.335 --> 01:56.801
What is that?

02:02.842 --> 02:05.243
Whose body is that, Garrett?

02:08.547 --> 02:10.749
Garrett, answer me.

02:13.519 --> 02:14.986
All right.

02:14.988 --> 02:17.522
Put your hands on your
head. I'm arresting you,

02:17.524 --> 02:20.892
and I'm taking you back to Boston.

02:20.894 --> 02:23.762
Garrett, put your hands on your head.

02:30.503 --> 02:32.370
I'm not going back to prison.

02:32.372 --> 02:33.838
You're digging up a body.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.340
You're already linked to a murder.

02:35.342 --> 02:37.409
You are out of options.

02:40.079 --> 02:42.747
That's not how I see it.

02:42.749 --> 02:45.583
No.

02:45.585 --> 02:47.218
I'm not going home to my pregnant wife

02:47.220 --> 02:50.855
to her I had to kill her
brother before he could kill me.

02:50.857 --> 02:54.292
I don't want to do that to Tessa.

02:54.294 --> 02:56.094
Do you?

02:56.096 --> 02:58.797
There's another way to do this.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.266
I just want you to start talking to me.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.969
Tell me what's happened.

03:04.971 --> 03:06.771
It can be easy.

03:10.342 --> 03:14.379
There's no other way, Garrett.

03:22.288 --> 03:25.557
Someone put these in my purse.

03:25.559 --> 03:27.792
What are you talking about?

03:27.794 --> 03:29.527
It's a message.

03:29.529 --> 03:32.230
Did you lock the door?

03:32.232 --> 03:34.499
When you came in, did you lock the door?

03:34.501 --> 03:37.902
Yes, Mom, what is going on?

03:37.904 --> 03:42.273
You need to know the whole story.

03:42.275 --> 03:44.642
Because I think we're in danger.

03:46.412 --> 03:48.746
It all started with you.

03:48.748 --> 03:51.716
YOUNG ALISON: Oh, Mom, those
cookies smell amazing

03:51.718 --> 03:53.384
- (Alison and Madeline chuckle)
- Thank you.

03:53.386 --> 03:55.887
You have to try one of
Mom's cookies, they're the best.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.892
- Here. (laughs)
- (laughing): No.

04:00.894 --> 04:02.861
TOM: How about this one?

04:02.863 --> 04:05.296
Tom, you need to look
capable, approachable.

04:05.298 --> 04:07.732
This looks like you just
won a beer pong tournament.

04:09.502 --> 04:10.935
(Tom and Alison laugh)

04:10.937 --> 04:13.338
No, I want you to win. If
you're class president,

04:13.340 --> 04:14.639
you'll have the dean's ear,

04:14.641 --> 04:16.141
You be able to push real issues

04:16.142 --> 04:19.077
like disability access and LGBT rights...

04:19.079 --> 04:20.778
(garbled): What's LGBT?

04:20.779 --> 04:23.381
Tessa, don't talk with a
thermometer in your mouth.

04:23.383 --> 04:25.917
And Ali, try not to
get glue on my table.

04:25.919 --> 04:27.352
Oh, we put newspaper down.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.987
Well, except there's a...

04:28.989 --> 04:30.522
hole in this one.

04:30.524 --> 04:33.291
Yeah, Dad loves
clipping his true crime stories.

04:33.293 --> 04:35.426
He thinks he's gonna solve one one day.

04:35.428 --> 04:37.362
- Maybe he will. - Oh.
- (thermometer beeps)

04:38.664 --> 04:41.232
Ah, 100.2.

04:41.234 --> 04:42.534
You, my dear,

04:42.536 --> 04:43.735
are officially sick.

04:43.737 --> 04:44.969
We should get you to bed.

04:44.971 --> 04:47.505
- Before we finish our game?
- Yes.

04:47.507 --> 04:50.575
Don't you think so, Garrett?

04:50.577 --> 04:55.246
Well, I've got 20 minutes to
kill before I meet Molly.

04:55.248 --> 04:57.582
MITCHELL: Ali...

04:57.584 --> 04:59.317
did you send that
box of tax returns over

04:59.319 --> 05:01.419
to the new accounting firm?

05:01.421 --> 05:03.354
- Stanbury Newcomb?
- Yeah.

05:03.356 --> 05:05.990
I just got a call. I think
you may have sent over a box

05:05.992 --> 05:08.259
of old payroll files by accident.

05:08.261 --> 05:10.862
Oh, sorry, I've just
been so caught up with finals

05:10.864 --> 05:11.996
and Tom's campaign.

05:11.998 --> 05:13.398
MITCHELL: No problem.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.300
I'll just get over there and get them.

05:18.137 --> 05:20.104
ALISON: Has anyone seen Cam?

05:20.106 --> 05:22.574
He supposed to help
us design these posters.

05:22.576 --> 05:24.809
He's, uh, uh, at Toby's house studying.

05:24.811 --> 05:26.411
GARRETT: Studying?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.580
It's possible. Toby's
a straight-A student,

05:28.582 --> 05:31.316
so maybe his good
habits are rubbing off on Cam.

05:31.318 --> 05:33.751
TOBY: <i>I'm more of a
supplier than a dealer.</i>

05:33.753 --> 05:35.453
(rock song playing over radio)

05:35.455 --> 05:39.457
I just like to help my friends out.

05:39.459 --> 05:42.794
But man, Cam, you're
gonna put me through college.

05:42.796 --> 05:47.012
You're hauling ass through these things.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.566
My shoulder's still killing
me from that cross-check

05:48.568 --> 05:50.735
I took against Milton.

05:50.737 --> 05:53.972
There is a cheaper option.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.611
Is that what I think it is?

05:59.613 --> 06:01.646
Depends, do you think it's heroin?

06:01.648 --> 06:02.981
(chuckles)

06:02.983 --> 06:04.916
Where'd you even get that stuff?

06:04.918 --> 06:06.417
Flew down to Colombia last weekend.

06:06.419 --> 06:08.686
Swallowed a balloon full of the stuff.

06:08.688 --> 06:11.307
From my cousin, he sells a little.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.524
Look, I told him I
could maybe move some.

06:13.526 --> 06:15.193
Look, anyway, it's-it's super mellow,

06:15.195 --> 06:16.561
and it's cheap.

06:16.563 --> 06:21.432
Nah, I'm good with these.

06:21.434 --> 06:22.667
And maybe some of these.

06:22.669 --> 06:24.402
(chuckles)

06:24.404 --> 06:26.004
MITCHELL: <i>That stuff is strong.</i>

06:26.006 --> 06:28.873
I know.

06:30.309 --> 06:31.776
She went out like a light.

06:37.650 --> 06:40.151
How did it go at the
accountant's office?

06:40.153 --> 06:42.654
Did you get the payroll files back?

06:42.656 --> 06:44.289
Did he see them?

06:44.291 --> 06:46.457
Did he realize?

06:46.459 --> 06:47.959
Well, offer him money.

06:47.961 --> 06:49.394
Whatever it takes.

06:50.596 --> 06:53.097
I don't know if he can be bought.

06:53.099 --> 06:55.566
Then call our lawyer.

06:55.568 --> 06:57.268
See if you can find a way out of this

06:57.270 --> 07:00.338
that you haven't thought of.

07:09.181 --> 07:11.983
Wait for my signal,

07:11.985 --> 07:14.519
then come in.

07:20.759 --> 07:23.494
Well, if they prosecute,

07:23.496 --> 07:28.032
what am I looking at? Ballpark?

07:28.034 --> 07:30.501
(lock unlatches, alarm beeps)

07:38.077 --> 07:40.244
(keypad beeps, then alarm stops)

08:12.211 --> 08:14.379
(quiet rustling)

08:20.386 --> 08:22.253
(thunder crash, Tessa screams)

08:22.255 --> 08:23.888
(grunting)

08:33.664 --> 08:35.400
Tessa.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.370
You all right, sweetheart?

08:39.371 --> 08:41.873
MADELINE: (gasps) Mitch.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.174
Take her back to her room.

08:45.611 --> 08:48.980
I pushed a man down the stairs?

08:48.982 --> 08:51.315
I don't remember that.

08:52.351 --> 08:54.118
Did he...

08:54.120 --> 08:55.820
Did he live?

08:58.090 --> 08:59.557
(sighs)

08:59.559 --> 09:01.959
I killed someone?

09:02.961 --> 09:06.431
It gets more complicated than that.

09:10.736 --> 09:12.303
He's dead.

09:12.305 --> 09:15.173
(sighs)

09:15.175 --> 09:16.841
(whispers): What is that?

09:25.384 --> 09:28.186
(bell jingling)

09:28.188 --> 09:31.155
<i>The man you pushed down the stairs</i>

09:31.157 --> 09:33.658
was the Silver Bells Killer.

09:50.643 --> 09:52.726
BRADY: That's your story?

09:52.728 --> 09:56.930
Tessa pushed the real
SBK down the stairs?

09:58.266 --> 09:59.700
That's the beginning of it.

09:59.702 --> 10:01.869
MOLLY: Who would I kill?

10:01.871 --> 10:04.104
Definitely kill Ross.

10:04.106 --> 10:05.339
Marry Chandler.

10:05.341 --> 10:07.875
(snorts) I like his last name.

10:07.877 --> 10:09.543
- Bing! (laughs)
- Oh.

10:09.545 --> 10:10.944
I like the sound of that.

10:10.946 --> 10:12.846
Molly Bing.

10:12.848 --> 10:15.015
So you'd change your last name.

10:15.017 --> 10:16.383
Maybe.

10:16.385 --> 10:17.618
Well, if you do, I think

10:17.620 --> 10:20.387
you can do better than "Molly Bing""

10:20.389 --> 10:23.891
You need something strong and literary.

10:23.893 --> 10:25.426
With two syllables.

10:25.428 --> 10:26.994
Careful what you say.

10:26.996 --> 10:28.662
I'll hold you to it.

10:28.664 --> 10:30.097
(laughs)

10:31.766 --> 10:33.934
(phone ringing)

10:40.275 --> 10:41.709
Hello?

10:43.378 --> 10:44.712
Tessa, what's wrong?

10:44.714 --> 10:46.280
GARRETT: <i>She sounded foggy,</i>

10:46.282 --> 10:47.748
<i>confused, very upset.</i>

10:47.750 --> 10:50.651
She wanted me to come home right away.

10:50.653 --> 10:53.253
When I got there,

10:53.255 --> 10:56.690
I saw a body crumpled on the stairs.

10:58.526 --> 11:00.260
Then my parents

11:00.262 --> 11:02.563
showed me who he was.

11:04.399 --> 11:05.933
The bag,

11:05.935 --> 11:08.435
the rope,

11:08.437 --> 11:09.970
the bells.

11:09.972 --> 11:12.172
They call the police?

11:12.174 --> 11:13.640
No.

11:15.477 --> 11:18.245
No, they said they
didn't want to do that.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.181
Why not?

11:21.183 --> 11:23.884
MITCHELL: <i>Think it through, Garrett.</i>

11:23.886 --> 11:26.086
The press descends on this place,

11:26.088 --> 11:28.388
we're defined by this forever.

11:28.390 --> 11:31.358
MADELINE: And Tessa...

11:31.360 --> 11:34.661
She's already so... fragile.

11:34.663 --> 11:37.598
But to know she came
so close to a monster

11:37.600 --> 11:39.566
and that she killed him?

11:39.568 --> 11:42.803
It's horrifying. It'll haunt her.

11:42.805 --> 11:45.239
- There's-these's no choice here.
We have... - Yes, there is.

11:45.241 --> 11:47.174
We can dispose of the body.

11:47.176 --> 11:49.743
No one needs to know.

11:49.745 --> 11:51.211
What?

11:52.547 --> 11:53.814
That's...

11:53.816 --> 11:56.083
This is crazy.

11:56.085 --> 11:57.518
Why?

11:57.520 --> 11:59.019
He won't be missed.

11:59.021 --> 12:01.889
And the world will be far
better off without him.

12:01.891 --> 12:03.657
And Tessa will be

12:03.659 --> 12:06.393
better off not
knowing how close she came.

12:06.395 --> 12:08.228
But she was there.

12:08.230 --> 12:09.496
She'll remember.

12:09.498 --> 12:11.265
MADELINE: She's running a fever.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.734
She's groggy and confused.

12:13.736 --> 12:15.202
But if you tell her

12:15.204 --> 12:16.637
that it was nothing,

12:16.639 --> 12:19.873
that it was another bad dream,

12:19.875 --> 12:22.309
she'll believe you.

12:22.311 --> 12:25.712
She trusts you more than
anyone else in the world.

12:28.283 --> 12:31.285
GARRETT: <i>So I did what they said.</i>

12:32.987 --> 12:36.456
<i>I told her it was just another
one of her nightmares.</i>

12:39.394 --> 12:41.628
<i>And she believed me.</i>

12:43.031 --> 12:44.898
Tomorrow, you're going to wake up

12:44.900 --> 12:47.668
and you're going to feel better.

12:55.109 --> 12:56.310
I remember Garrett

12:56.312 --> 12:58.779
comforting me after a nightmare.

13:01.082 --> 13:03.750
But SBK was here

13:03.752 --> 13:05.185
to kill one of us?

13:05.187 --> 13:07.221
And you stopped him, thank God.

13:07.223 --> 13:08.922
CAM: So...

13:08.924 --> 13:11.091
the real SBK

13:11.093 --> 13:13.293
was the body I saw

13:13.295 --> 13:16.363
dragged down the stairs that night.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.501
Yes.

13:23.171 --> 13:25.372
Okay.

13:32.413 --> 13:34.147
CAM: Crap.

13:34.149 --> 13:35.883
What?

21:05.326 --> 21:08.193

21:08.195 --> 21:10.696
took money from their 401 kays,

21:10.698 --> 21:13.365
and then put it in a company slush fund.

21:13.367 --> 21:16.035
We used that money to land a
major construction contract.

21:16.037 --> 21:17.703
Fraud!

21:17.705 --> 21:20.372
A contract that kept our

accountant David Morales

22:51.173 --> 22:52.906
was found strangled this morning

22:52.908 --> 22:55.375
in what appears to be the
sixth Silver Bells killing

22:55.377 --> 22:56.743
in three years.

22:56.745 --> 22:59.679
A string of murders
that have continued...

22:59.681 --> 23:01.081
It's not possible.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.549
...to stump authorities
and grip this city...

23:02.551 --> 23:04.184
GARRETT: <i>My dad killed him.</i>

23:04.186 --> 23:07.120
That's why he wanted
me to get rid of the body.

23:07.122 --> 23:09.055
It was never about protecting Tessa.

23:10.194 --> 23:12.859
He manipulated me.

23:12.861 --> 23:14.828
So that he had cover.

23:14.830 --> 23:17.130
A scapegoat.

23:17.132 --> 23:19.332
So that he could silence David Morales

23:19.334 --> 23:21.901
to save himself.

23:24.190 --> 23:27.941
And in doing that...

23:27.943 --> 23:31.845
he made me a killer.

23:31.847 --> 23:33.786
Just like him.

23:44.789 --> 23:46.880
So Dad wasn't Silver Bells.

23:46.882 --> 23:47.948
He was a copycat.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.450
He didn't kill

23:49.452 --> 23:51.285
out of some compulsion or sickness...

23:51.287 --> 23:53.020
But to protect his fortune?

23:53.022 --> 23:55.222
TESSA: Why didn't you tell us

23:55.224 --> 23:56.957
when we found the bells?

23:56.959 --> 23:58.926
Or when the DNA matched the belt?

23:58.928 --> 24:00.694
You made us think he was a monster.

24:00.696 --> 24:02.396
He was.

24:02.398 --> 24:04.331
He was still a killer.

24:04.333 --> 24:07.668
It seemed better to
let it all die with him.

24:07.670 --> 24:11.338
Did you know that he was
gonna kill David Morales?

24:11.340 --> 24:12.539
Of course not.

24:12.541 --> 24:13.740
TESSA: It doesn't matter, Mom.

24:13.742 --> 24:16.243
You went along with it for years.

24:16.245 --> 24:18.645
I kept telling myself that this was

24:18.647 --> 24:22.082
a desperate effort to keep us safe.

24:22.084 --> 24:23.684
You should've turned him in.

24:25.153 --> 24:27.621
And if I had,

24:27.623 --> 24:29.590
do you think for one second

24:29.592 --> 24:31.792
you'd be in the position you are now?

24:31.794 --> 24:34.228
Days from potentially

24:34.230 --> 24:35.662
being elected mayor?

24:35.664 --> 24:37.865
Your father would've gone to prison.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.434
Garrett would've gone to prison.

24:40.436 --> 24:42.269
I might've, too.

24:42.271 --> 24:45.105
And I couldn't do
that to the rest of you.

24:46.908 --> 24:48.775
You were starting down

24:48.777 --> 24:50.611
a bad road, Cam.

24:50.613 --> 24:52.346
And you were just a child.

24:52.348 --> 24:54.615
All of you needed

24:54.617 --> 24:57.084
your family intact.

24:59.521 --> 25:02.289
Mom said Tom lost the election.

25:02.291 --> 25:04.725
Yeah, he, uh,
couldn't get the Greek vote.

25:04.727 --> 25:08.195
How come you didn't run?

25:08.197 --> 25:11.431
Because you have to have a certain...

25:12.734 --> 25:14.701
Because, uh... I'm not as...

25:14.703 --> 25:16.069
(chuckles) I don't know.

25:16.071 --> 25:17.404
That's a fair question.

25:17.406 --> 25:20.140
There's always senior year.

25:20.142 --> 25:23.510
I bet you'd get the Greek vote.

25:23.512 --> 25:25.179
Cam said he's not sure

25:25.181 --> 25:27.848
he even wanted to go to college.

25:27.850 --> 25:30.050
Bet that went over well with Mom.

25:30.052 --> 25:32.419
MADELINE: <i>I can't believe this.</i>

25:32.421 --> 25:35.589
Do you know how easy it is
to get hooked on this stuff?

25:41.863 --> 25:44.264
- (toilet flushes)
- (faint shouting in distance)

25:48.433 --> 25:50.137
MITCHELL: I would've gone to prison!

25:50.139 --> 25:51.638
GARRETT: You should go to prison!

25:51.640 --> 25:53.807
<i>He tried to rationalize it.</i>

25:53.809 --> 25:56.843
<i>He tried to rationalize murder.</i>

25:56.845 --> 25:58.512
<i>Imagine what it's like</i>

25:58.514 --> 25:59.880
to stand across from your father

25:59.882 --> 26:01.982
and have him admit that he's a killer.

26:03.384 --> 26:04.851
That he strangled an innocent man.

26:04.853 --> 26:06.220
He took a belt,

26:06.222 --> 26:08.722
he wrapped it around
his neck and he squeezed

26:08.724 --> 26:10.524
the life out of him.

26:10.526 --> 26:12.759
Can you imagine that?

26:12.761 --> 26:14.761
So I went to my mom.

26:14.763 --> 26:16.496
<i>It was Dad.</i>

26:16.498 --> 26:18.599
He killed David Morales.

26:18.601 --> 26:20.300
And he made it look like SBK,

26:20.302 --> 26:23.370
because nobody else knows SBK is dead.

26:23.372 --> 26:25.772
No, there's no way.

26:25.774 --> 26:28.275
He admitted it, Mom.

26:28.277 --> 26:29.643
He told me.

26:29.645 --> 26:31.645
And she was horrified.

26:31.647 --> 26:33.380
Said she had no idea.

26:35.650 --> 26:36.984
None.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.819
We need to call the police.

26:38.821 --> 26:40.120
No.

26:40.122 --> 26:42.222
No.

26:43.324 --> 26:44.691
What?

26:44.693 --> 26:45.993
She said that whatever he did,

26:45.995 --> 26:48.028
he did it to protect the family.

26:48.030 --> 26:51.598
That he was wrong, but
that he did it for us.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.735
And she didn't want to turn him in.

26:54.737 --> 26:57.811
You're going to stand beside a killer?

26:59.932 --> 27:01.708
Well, then I'll go to the police myself.

27:01.710 --> 27:04.278
No, you won't!

27:06.748 --> 27:10.150
You killed someone, too, Garrett.

27:10.152 --> 27:12.152
If you call the police on your father,

27:12.154 --> 27:14.488
you're gonna go to
jail right alongside him.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.690
It was self-defense!

27:18.326 --> 27:20.360
You took a body...

27:20.362 --> 27:22.629
and drove it to Maine to bury it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.602
You paved the way for a copycat murder.

27:31.439 --> 27:34.641
That doesn't look like self-defense.

27:38.179 --> 27:42.716
That looks like you and your
father were working together.

27:46.554 --> 27:48.322
I couldn't stand to look at her.

27:48.324 --> 27:49.956
Or him.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.959
It was all over the news.

27:52.961 --> 27:55.629
Pictures of David Morales.

27:55.631 --> 27:57.397
Christina.

27:57.399 --> 27:59.132
I couldn't stand it.

27:59.134 --> 28:02.903
But I also couldn't come forward.

28:02.905 --> 28:05.739
Not without ruining everyone's
lives, including my own.

28:05.741 --> 28:08.975
The only thing I could
think to do was to start over.

28:12.413 --> 28:15.082
So one night...

28:15.084 --> 28:17.250
I left.

28:17.252 --> 28:19.453
(crickets chirping)

28:41.642 --> 28:43.043
Hey, Cam?

28:51.519 --> 28:53.487
My mom flushed my pills.

28:53.489 --> 28:55.555
Got to give me more.

28:55.557 --> 28:57.924
That's gonna take me a couple weeks.

28:57.926 --> 28:59.960
Look, here.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.795
No, no. Those messed me up.

29:01.797 --> 29:03.430
Made me hallucinate.

29:03.432 --> 29:04.631
It was bad.

29:04.633 --> 29:06.700
(sighs) Well,

29:06.702 --> 29:09.302
still got this H.

29:11.372 --> 29:14.508
Uh, do... do I, like, inject it?

29:14.510 --> 29:17.878
Nah, you... you can snort it.

29:25.853 --> 29:28.622
MITCHELL: <i>What if we lose him forever?</i>

29:28.624 --> 29:32.926
Garrett just needs time to
come to terms with what happened.

29:32.928 --> 29:34.694
He'll come back.

29:36.864 --> 29:39.533
What if he decides...

29:39.535 --> 29:42.135
he can't...

29:42.137 --> 29:44.905
live with the secret anymore?

29:44.907 --> 29:47.941
If he was going to
talk, he would have already.

29:50.711 --> 29:53.447
We just need to put this behind us.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.922
How?

30:04.192 --> 30:06.893
By pretending it never happened.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.431
And making a promise to each other

30:11.433 --> 30:14.134
never to speak of it again.

30:18.372 --> 30:20.874
<i>We thought it was our secret.</i>

30:20.876 --> 30:23.376
We didn't know there
was anybody else out there.

30:23.378 --> 30:24.444
An accomplice.

30:24.446 --> 30:25.612
And now they're back.

30:25.614 --> 30:26.713
CAM: Okay.

30:26.715 --> 30:28.782
That is just about all the crazy

30:28.784 --> 30:30.851
I can take for today.

30:30.853 --> 30:33.687
Somebody broke into this house

30:33.689 --> 30:35.288
and put those bells in my purse.

30:35.290 --> 30:37.290
ALISON: You could have
put them there yourself.

30:37.292 --> 30:38.258
What?

30:38.260 --> 30:39.693
TESSA: She's right.

30:39.695 --> 30:41.394
Why should we believe a word you say?

30:41.396 --> 30:43.897
You've been lying to us for years.

30:43.899 --> 30:46.032
MADELINE: I was protecting you.

30:46.034 --> 30:48.168
The same reason I'm
telling you the truth now,

30:48.170 --> 30:49.703
because we're in danger.

30:49.705 --> 30:51.872
There is an accomplice.

30:51.874 --> 30:53.874
And whoever it is killed
Jennifer Windham

30:53.876 --> 30:55.742
and that poor blind woman...

30:55.744 --> 30:57.110
That doesn't mean they're after us.

30:57.112 --> 30:58.545
CAM: Guys?

30:58.547 --> 31:00.480
(chuckles): This could
just be a manipulation,

31:00.482 --> 31:02.549
a desperate attempt to scare us

31:02.551 --> 31:04.684
into keeping quiet about what you did.

31:04.686 --> 31:06.319
CAM: Guys?

31:12.894 --> 31:15.328
Guys, look at this.

31:15.330 --> 31:17.030
Here in...

31:31.345 --> 31:32.979
It's us.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.905
ALISON: Who could have done this?

31:43.907 --> 31:46.207
W-We've been here.

31:47.549 --> 31:48.749
It's the accomplice.

31:48.751 --> 31:50.317
Taunting us.

31:50.319 --> 31:52.920
Yeah, here's an idea. Why
don't we call the cops,

31:52.922 --> 31:55.222
let them figure it out, so
we can, you know, stay alive.

31:55.224 --> 31:56.523
We can't do that.

31:56.525 --> 31:59.927
You should have done it 14 years ago!

32:00.795 --> 32:02.429
Cam, you are right.

32:02.431 --> 32:04.151
But if we bring in the police now,

32:04.276 --> 32:05.699
we have to tell them everything.

32:05.701 --> 32:07.301
And Garrett will go to jail,

32:07.303 --> 32:09.370
after everything he's been through.

32:12.173 --> 32:13.207
(mumbles): Yeah.

32:13.209 --> 32:15.409
BRADY: <i>Why take the risk?</i>

32:15.411 --> 32:18.512
Why come back up
here after all this time

32:18.514 --> 32:20.714
and dig up these bones?

32:23.251 --> 32:25.619
Well, I figured if I got rid
of the one piece of evidence

32:25.621 --> 32:27.788
that connects me to this whole thing,

32:30.358 --> 32:32.626
I might have a chance at a new life.

32:34.929 --> 32:37.798
Christina's pregnant.

32:41.803 --> 32:43.837
We can work out a deal for you.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.472
We can make sure that you don't miss

32:45.474 --> 32:47.908
your kid's whole life.

32:47.910 --> 32:50.077
What about when we get
back and all this comes out?

32:50.079 --> 32:52.079
- Your superiors...
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

32:53.982 --> 32:55.282
When you were in prison,

32:55.284 --> 32:56.950
and you talked to me, you told me

32:56.952 --> 32:58.919
that you believed I'm a good man.

32:59.954 --> 33:02.189
You have my word.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.425
If you cooperate,

33:04.427 --> 33:06.360
and you help us find this accomplice,

33:06.362 --> 33:10.164
I will do everything that I
can to keep you out of jail.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.566
You need me, Garrett.

33:12.568 --> 33:14.735
And I need you, too.

33:15.737 --> 33:17.871
Why do you need me?

33:17.873 --> 33:20.107
Because you're the biggest
lead we've ever had.

33:21.576 --> 33:23.877
You've seen Silver Bells' face.

33:29.317 --> 33:31.485
I told Tom to take
the girls out of town.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.153
I wish we could get ahold of Garrett.

33:33.155 --> 33:35.656
I know, I tried Brady and
left him a message. No answer.

33:35.658 --> 33:37.324
You know, my son's upstairs sleeping.

33:37.326 --> 33:38.392
I'm not waiting
around... I'm calling the cops.

33:38.394 --> 33:39.893
What about Garrett?!

33:39.895 --> 33:42.029
Garrett's not here, and
Garrett's not coming.

33:42.031 --> 33:43.497
And I'm not gonna wait around

33:43.499 --> 33:47.301
while some craft-loving
psychopath toys with us!

33:47.303 --> 33:49.636
Listen to me. We'll give
him till the morning.

33:49.638 --> 33:51.605
If he's not back by
then, we'll call the police.

33:52.607 --> 33:55.142
Fine.

33:55.144 --> 33:57.344
Should've turned Dad in.

33:57.346 --> 34:01.115
(door opens)

34:01.117 --> 34:02.716
(door closes)

34:02.718 --> 34:03.884
Where's the phone?

34:03.886 --> 34:05.953
We need to get the police here.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.723
Wait.

34:11.292 --> 34:14.928
Think about this for a second.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.063
Think about...

34:17.065 --> 34:19.833
David Morales.

34:19.835 --> 34:22.002
What about him?

34:23.571 --> 34:26.607
What happens when he talks?

34:26.609 --> 34:28.509
Company goes bankrupt.

34:28.511 --> 34:30.143
I go to prison.

34:30.146 --> 34:31.512
They freeze

34:31.514 --> 34:34.547
all of our assets, we become pariahs,

34:34.550 --> 34:36.949
and the children have nothing.

34:38.386 --> 34:40.454
Or...

34:40.456 --> 34:42.489
Or what?

34:43.491 --> 34:45.692
Or maybe...

34:47.762 --> 34:50.597
...David Morales becomes the next victim

34:50.599 --> 34:52.900
of the Silver Bells Killer.

34:52.902 --> 34:55.601
If we don't call the police,
we can get rid of this body

34:55.603 --> 34:57.438
and pretend like it never happened.

34:57.440 --> 35:01.108
People will think Silver
Bells is still out there.

35:01.110 --> 35:02.743
Maddie.

35:02.745 --> 35:04.812
You cannot be serious.

35:04.814 --> 35:06.580
I know.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.949
You're right.

35:08.951 --> 35:10.617
It's awful.

35:10.619 --> 35:13.987
But we're in a horrible situation.

35:13.989 --> 35:16.490
And suddenly,

35:16.492 --> 35:18.325
we're given a way out of it.

35:18.887 --> 35:20.555
We have all the tools

35:20.557 --> 35:22.490
to make it look like he did it.

35:22.492 --> 35:26.661
A silver bell that will
match the other crime scenes.

35:28.197 --> 35:30.365
You know all about this case.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.700
You've read all the articles.

35:32.702 --> 35:36.371
You can make it look real.

35:39.341 --> 35:42.043
Mitchell, we're in this mess

35:42.045 --> 35:44.679
with Morales because you cheated,

35:44.681 --> 35:48.816
and you put all of us

35:48.818 --> 35:50.785
in jeopardy.

35:54.089 --> 35:55.490
(sighs)

35:55.492 --> 35:58.192
Please, Mitchell.

35:59.728 --> 36:02.230
We need you.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.234
We need you

36:06.236 --> 36:08.342
to save your family from your mistakes.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.904
(door opens)

36:11.407 --> 36:12.707
Garrett.

36:12.709 --> 36:14.909
Tessa called me.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.144
Is she...

36:16.146 --> 36:17.412
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

36:17.414 --> 36:18.579
Wait.

36:18.581 --> 36:19.847
What happened?

36:19.849 --> 36:20.915
Who is that?

36:20.917 --> 36:21.916
He broke in.

36:21.918 --> 36:24.018
And he ran into Tessa

36:24.020 --> 36:25.553
when he was on his way up the stairs.

36:25.555 --> 36:28.389
She was scared and...

36:28.391 --> 36:31.059
(voice breaking): she pushed him.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.728
What, is he dead?

36:33.730 --> 36:36.197
Garrett...

36:36.199 --> 36:38.433
it's the Silver Bells Killer.

36:40.135 --> 36:42.203
Well, have you called the police?

36:42.205 --> 36:43.404
No.

36:45.474 --> 36:47.408
Why not?

36:47.410 --> 36:49.844
Think it through, Garrett.

36:49.846 --> 36:52.213
The press descends on this place.

36:52.215 --> 36:55.349
We're defined by this forever.

37:09.298 --> 37:12.400
Mr. Morales, please,

37:12.402 --> 37:15.403
there's got to be
something we can do about this.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.705
I'm not changing my mind.

37:23.512 --> 37:26.047
$3 million.

37:26.049 --> 37:31.018
Put it toward
restitution for your victims.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.854
Four! Enough!

37:39.595 --> 37:42.296
I need you to leave.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.170
(sighs)

37:58.113 --> 38:02.150
(gagging, grunting)

38:05.187 --> 38:06.988
(yells)

38:06.990 --> 38:08.422
(groaning)

38:13.295 --> 38:14.695
(Dave gagging)

38:14.697 --> 38:15.763
Maddie.

38:15.765 --> 38:18.866
- I can't do this.
- (coughing)

38:18.868 --> 38:20.701
(grunts)

38:20.703 --> 38:22.503
- (belt tightening)
- (grunts)

38:22.505 --> 38:25.006
(breathing heavily)

38:26.308 --> 38:29.544
(breathing fades)

38:33.215 --> 38:34.849
(sighs)

38:47.062 --> 38:48.596
(sighs)

38:56.738 --> 38:57.939
(bell rings)

39:10.152 --> 39:13.588
We're all victims of
your father's decisions.

39:17.359 --> 39:19.060
It's true.

39:20.362 --> 39:23.364
We're all being targeted.

39:23.366 --> 39:26.601
So we need to stick
together as a family.

39:26.603 --> 39:30.304
Until we figure out what's going on.

39:30.306 --> 39:33.407
Figure out who's out there.

39:33.409 --> 39:35.576
Hunting us.
