WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.760
He's totally checking you out.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.600
The first time since Julie left me,
I don't feel completely alone.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.480
The DA comes to see at the beginning of summer,
tells me the sky is falling,

00:12.600 --> 00:14.160
and he hasn't done a damn thing since.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.239
You're not charging that on the company card, are you?

00:16.320 --> 00:17.000
Why?

00:17.760 --> 00:19.320
Acknowledge me now, or lose me forever.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.760
I can't believe this.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.160
So you and Summer?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
Not so good, actually. She'll probably
never speak to me again.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.685
- Do you guys still talk?
- No, not really.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.080
We used to. But it just sort of made everything harder.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.880
- We could not go.
- Can't not go.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.040
We can so not go. We already missed registration.
It's not like anyone's expecting us.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.600
- Your mom called the school, man.
- Uh, did my mom call the...

00:45.680 --> 00:47.640
You're the bad boy. Okay? You're the outsider.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.800
You're supposed to be leading me
into temptation, not homeroom.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.960
- It's just the first day of school, man.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.320
An entire day of just Ashton Kutchers,
knuckle-knocking and going on and on about summer.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.320
Their summer, not my... The season, not the person.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.360
- At this point, how would I even know?
- What, you haven't called her yet?

01:05.440 --> 01:09.360
Um, before you read this, remind me to explain
the difference to you between
Plastic Man and Elongated Man.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.880
- So that's a no, then.
- When would I have had the time to call her?

01:11.920 --> 01:15.000
I just got back into town. I have three
months of back issues to bag and board

01:15.080 --> 01:18.560
and on top of that now, apparently
I don't know, I have to go to school.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.920
- You could have called her from Portland.
- I did call her from Portland.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.880
Every day. And I got her voicemail
until she finally picked up and said

01:23.920 --> 01:26.040
if I ever call her again, her father will have me killed.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.560
So Summer has no idea you're back.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.320
Killed, Ryan, as in dead.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.440
That was months ago. She's probably moved on by now.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.800
I'm sorry. "Moved on"?

01:36.600 --> 01:37.760
Gotten over it?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.560
Gotten over it? Why?

01:40.640 --> 01:43.000
Because I just... I meant nothing to her?

01:43.080 --> 01:45.480
I'm going to brood silently. Over here.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.520
- No, she's going to have me killed.
- She's not going to have you killed.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.920
Fine, then maybe you're right.
She will ignore me, which would be worse.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
So, Summer's been ignoring you for years. You can take it.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.200
Yeah, but that was before I knew
what it was like to not be ignored.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.840
Why should I have to go back to that? Why?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.760
Because you left for three months without telling her?

01:58.840 --> 02:00.600
- So you're saying it's my fault?
- You are kind of the one who left.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.360
- Yeah, because of you.
- Oh, so it's my fault?

02:02.960 --> 02:04.040
Do you think she'll buy that?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.680
- Seth, just talk to her.
- And say what, exactly?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.160
I don't know. "I'm sorry," maybe?

02:08.280 --> 02:10.280
Really? I'm sorry.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.040
Is that what you said to Marissa?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.080
No, but I'm going to.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.040
Oh. Oh, oh, okay, then.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.560
So it turns out, what do you know?
I'm not the only coward in the room.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.680
No, I'm just going to see her at school. I know that.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.800
Really? She's going to walk up to you in front
of the entire student body and be all, "Hey... "

02:28.880 --> 02:30.320
And just hope she "heys" you back?

02:33.400 --> 02:35.080
Yeah, we're not going to school.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.757 --> 03:10.197
Okay, man, listen. Whatever happens today at school,

03:10.237 --> 03:12.917
the important thing is the Ryan-Seth
team's back in action, okay?

03:13.277 --> 03:14.957
Together there's nothing we can't face.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.157
I'm moving to Portland.

03:19.277 --> 03:20.637
- Good morning, men.
- Hey.

03:20.717 --> 03:22.077
- Sleep well?
- No.

03:22.317 --> 03:24.197
- Ready for your first day of school?
- No.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.077
- There's bagels.
- There's coffee.

03:26.157 --> 03:28.517
- Love some, thanks.
- And then there's Archie.

03:28.597 --> 03:31.117
Yeah. Will you explain to me this
whole remodeling thing again?

03:31.357 --> 03:32.677
Your mother got bored this summer.

03:32.917 --> 03:36.757
Your father was complaining that he didn't
have a place for his surfing memorabilia.

03:37.237 --> 03:39.317
Oh, so it is my fault.

03:39.837 --> 03:42.157
- We'll be out of the kitchen by dinner.
- How about the rest of the house?

03:42.637 --> 03:44.077
- Is that the phone?
- Sandy?

03:44.277 --> 03:46.997
- Honey, I'm mid-shmear.
- I am late for work.

03:47.037 --> 03:48.997
Well, if I could find it, maybe I'd answer it.

03:52.877 --> 03:53.597
Hello?

03:55.237 --> 03:55.957
Hello?

03:57.157 --> 03:59.477
- Well, they hung up.
- I hate it when they do that.

03:59.597 --> 04:03.837
I called the school so you're registered. You just
have to go by the office and fill out some paperwork.

04:03.872 --> 04:05.957
Your father's going to go with you
in case there's any problems.

04:05.997 --> 04:06.597
All right.

04:07.077 --> 04:08.277
I thought you were going to take him?

04:09.037 --> 04:11.157
- I have a meeting.
- I have a meeting.

04:11.277 --> 04:13.077
If it's too much trouble, maybe we should stay home.

04:14.237 --> 04:15.597
I have to go.

04:20.237 --> 04:23.677
- Hello?
- I'm really glad that you guys are home.

04:23.757 --> 04:25.837
- Good, maybe you should raise our allowances then.
- He's where?

04:26.597 --> 04:27.637
You don't know?

04:28.557 --> 04:29.357
It's the office.

04:29.877 --> 04:31.437
All right. I'll find him. Thank you.

04:32.037 --> 04:33.877
- I have to go.
- I have to go.

04:33.997 --> 04:35.117
You want me to take them?

04:46.357 --> 04:48.357
This is not an auspicious way
to start the school year.

04:48.437 --> 04:50.597
- Thanks, Archie.
- Don't worry about it, man. I'm sure nobody saw us.

04:53.437 --> 04:54.957
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

04:55.037 --> 04:58.157
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! Ryan!

05:01.597 --> 05:02.877
- Hey!
- Hey.

05:05.437 --> 05:07.237
- Oy, wish me luck.
- Yeah.

05:07.757 --> 05:08.517
Summer.

05:08.637 --> 05:10.557
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, I'm back.

05:10.637 --> 05:13.557
I'm back at the Cohens', back at Harbor. I'm back.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.877
But how? I mean, what about Theresa?

05:15.997 --> 05:17.437
It's kind of a long story.

05:18.477 --> 05:20.117
Well, I want to hear it if you want to tell me.

05:20.197 --> 05:21.917
Uh, yeah, sure. Uh, after school?

05:22.397 --> 05:23.957
After school. It's a date.

05:26.877 --> 05:27.677
Summer.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.797
- Are you just not even going to talk to me?
- Nope. Sorry, Cohen.

05:32.877 --> 05:35.237
You know, maybe I'll write you a letter
and you can read it over and over,

05:35.317 --> 05:37.837
trying to figure out what the hell
I was thinking all summer. Ass.

05:37.917 --> 05:41.077
- Just wait a second.
- I am done waiting for you, Cohen.

05:43.397 --> 05:46.077
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go meet my boyfriend.

05:50.717 --> 05:51.557
Boyfriend?

05:56.877 --> 05:58.437
I can't believe this is happening.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.597
How much are they offering?

06:01.997 --> 06:02.717
Wow.

06:03.357 --> 06:04.477
So when do we have to be there?

06:05.917 --> 06:08.277
I can't. It's too soon.

06:08.717 --> 06:10.237
I still haven't told Jimmy yet.

06:12.437 --> 06:13.557
'Cause I don't want to hurt him.

06:13.677 --> 06:17.077
Hey. There you are, to be sure.

06:17.157 --> 06:20.837
Jimmy's up. I've got to go. I will. I promise. Bye.

06:21.277 --> 06:23.237
- Susie says hi.
- Susie...

06:24.357 --> 06:26.637
- ... calls too early.
- It's almost 9:00.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.917
Whoa. Time for a mimosa.

06:29.157 --> 06:33.517
- Are you trying to get me drunk?
- I am trying to keep you drunk.

06:33.677 --> 06:37.397
Last night was... pretty awesome.

06:39.077 --> 06:40.597
The whole summer's been awesome-

06:41.357 --> 06:43.797
the beach, the yacht, you.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.517
No, you.

06:47.517 --> 06:48.397
You're the one.

06:49.197 --> 06:51.797
Listen, I've got a really good idea,
and I want you to...

06:51.917 --> 06:53.917
I want you to really concentrate on it, okay?

06:54.517 --> 06:58.677
We should keep the boat for another month,
and we go down to Cabo.

07:00.317 --> 07:02.637
- Jimmy, we can't.
- Why can't we?

07:02.877 --> 07:05.877
Come on. It's not like either of us have
jobs that we have to go back to.

07:07.157 --> 07:11.037
Come on. I'll manage my portfolio online,

07:11.117 --> 07:13.957
and, you know, this way the summer never has to end.

07:14.877 --> 07:16.837
You know? Right? Am I right?

07:17.797 --> 07:18.917
- Right.
- Right.

07:18.997 --> 07:20.237
Right. Right.

07:21.477 --> 07:25.517
So, I put this schedule together for you,
which you'll probably hate, which is fine.

07:25.557 --> 07:26.557
I'm sure it's okay. Thanks.

07:26.597 --> 07:28.517
I based it on the schedule from last year.

07:29.037 --> 07:31.757
- Nice GPA, by the way.
- Really? Thanks.

07:32.797 --> 07:37.197
So, is there anything missing?
Favorite subject, favorite teacher?

07:37.237 --> 07:39.077
Electives? Anything?

07:39.237 --> 07:42.717
Honestly, I'm just happy not to be
working construction right now, so...

07:43.597 --> 07:47.197
You know, Ryan, it's not too early
to start thinking about colleges.

07:47.637 --> 07:51.557
Uh, thanks, but I can't really afford college,
and I'm not about to let the Cohens pay for it.

07:51.597 --> 07:56.517
Ryan, you have great test scores, a solid GPA.

07:56.557 --> 07:59.757
And if you work your ass off when you get out of here,
you can do whatever you want.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.797
The question is: what do you want?

08:05.717 --> 08:06.637
How do you mean?

08:07.277 --> 08:11.717
Well, um, what do you like?
What are you interested in?

08:14.717 --> 08:15.637
I don't know.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.637
Seriously, I don't know.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.677
Oh. Okay.

08:23.797 --> 08:25.597
I have an assignment for you.

08:25.677 --> 08:29.037
I want you to go to your classes and then
write down everything you like about them

08:29.077 --> 08:32.597
and everything you don't like about them,
and most importantly, why.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.477
Then I want you to come by here
tomorrow and we'll go over it together

08:34.517 --> 08:36.037
and make sure you get what you want.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.717
Miss Fisher, I'm sure this schedule is fine, really.

08:38.037 --> 08:39.756
You'll find out. Let me know.

08:40.157 --> 08:41.236
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

08:41.797 --> 08:42.477
Yep.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.837
Love letter to Marissa?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.077
No, no, it's, uh...

08:53.997 --> 08:56.677
- Did, uh, did Miss Fisher give you an assignment?
- No, she didn't.

08:56.757 --> 09:00.317
But then again, I didn't get a warm,
cinematic embrace from anyone when
I got to school either.

09:00.597 --> 09:02.637
- Did you guys talk at least?
- Yeah, we sure did.

09:02.717 --> 09:06.197
- Long enough for her to tell me she has a boyfriend.
- Oh, buddy, I'm sorry.

09:06.237 --> 09:07.437
It's all right, man. You know what?

09:07.637 --> 09:09.837
I had a whole life at this school before Summer.

09:11.757 --> 09:13.277
- I'm sure.
- Yeah, one of an outcast, maybe,

09:13.357 --> 09:16.837
but I'll have you know, at one point,
I was a vital part of the Harbor club scene.

09:16.917 --> 09:18.197
- There's a Harbor club scene?
- Yeah, sure.

09:18.277 --> 09:22.717
Sailing club, film club, and, wait for it, wait for it...

09:23.877 --> 09:26.197
comic book club. Check it out. Huh?

09:28.997 --> 09:30.557
- Who's this guy?
- That's me with powers.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.597
The power to be handsome. What do you think?

09:32.717 --> 09:35.037
I think this may have something to
do with the whole outcast thing.

09:35.077 --> 09:38.797
No, Ryan, it doesn't. Listen, Spider Man 2.
Do you know how much money
that made at the box office?

09:38.917 --> 09:42.797
We're not outcasts anymore, okay?
We're edgy. We're like trailblazers.

09:43.237 --> 09:46.917
- We?
- Listen, Miss Fisher says get involved, right?

09:46.997 --> 09:51.157
Well, I need to get involved on this, get involved,
get on board, you, me, comic book club, okay?

09:51.197 --> 09:54.037
And hopefully others. Pass those out.
I need you to pass those out. Thank you.

09:54.237 --> 09:56.757
Hey, guys. A comic book league. Check it out.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.597
We're going to be getting into the issues,
the stuff that matters, you know what I mean?

09:59.677 --> 10:02.397
Today's topic: "Capes: Fey or kind of cool"?

10:02.437 --> 10:04.197
Ryan, you'd better be passing those out, my man!

10:04.557 --> 10:06.117
Thanks for taking me to get my car.

10:06.277 --> 10:07.837
Anything to get away from Cohen.

10:08.757 --> 10:10.237
Do you want to go get lunch after this?

10:10.917 --> 10:12.757
I should probably get back to school.

10:12.997 --> 10:14.317
Back to Ryan, you mean?

10:14.837 --> 10:17.877
So tell me, is he taking you to the kickoff carnival?

10:17.997 --> 10:20.637
Are you guys going to go for another
spin on the Ferris wheel?

10:20.757 --> 10:22.317
He said we'd talk after school.

10:22.437 --> 10:24.557
- About getting back together?
- No, I don't know.

10:25.237 --> 10:27.397
- Would that be so bad?
- No, I mean...

10:28.157 --> 10:30.997
Well, it's just... him and Cohen- they just can't think

10:31.037 --> 10:33.917
they can walk in and out of our lives
whenever they want, you know?

10:34.597 --> 10:35.917
Whose truck is that?

10:36.157 --> 10:39.317
That's the yard guy's, and he's
blocking my car in the driveway again.

10:39.397 --> 10:41.637
Hey, hey! DJ, you're blocking my car.

10:41.917 --> 10:43.797
Do not honk at DJ. He's hot.

10:44.717 --> 10:48.157
- He's the yard guy.
- Well, he can park his truck in my driveway any time.

10:51.277 --> 10:52.357
I'll see you back at school.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.317
- What are you doing in here?
- I work here.

11:26.077 --> 11:27.037
I have to go.

11:28.037 --> 11:28.997
So go.

11:39.797 --> 11:41.357
Will I still see you today after school?

11:42.757 --> 11:45.437
I can't, I'm sorry. It's just...

11:45.517 --> 11:47.477
It's okay. Don't worry.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.757
I may still be here when you get back.

12:15.237 --> 12:15.917
Hey.

12:16.637 --> 12:18.477
- What are we drinking?
- Sum, wait...

12:21.757 --> 12:24.037
What are you drinking? Did you spike your latte?

12:24.197 --> 12:26.717
- It's been a weird day.
- Marissa, we're at school.

12:26.797 --> 12:28.077
Yeah, exactly.

12:34.157 --> 12:35.677
What is going on with you?

12:37.277 --> 12:38.757
Did something happen with Ryan?

12:39.397 --> 12:40.877
What am I supposed to say to him?

12:41.357 --> 12:41.997
About?

12:44.077 --> 12:46.517
About... DJ.

12:46.557 --> 12:50.157
DJ? Who in the hell is... Oh, my God, the yard guy?

12:50.197 --> 12:53.157
- Yeah, I know.
- Marissa! Since when?

12:53.197 --> 12:56.157
- Since, I don't know, all summer.
- And you didn't tell me?

12:56.277 --> 13:00.237
Summer, I couldn't tell anyone.
No one can find out about this.

13:00.317 --> 13:03.157
Okay. But God, that is so hot.

13:03.237 --> 13:06.757
- No, it's not, believe me.
- Really? But he's so ripped.

13:06.797 --> 13:08.397
No, he's great. It's just...

13:09.437 --> 13:10.477
He's the yard guy.

13:12.117 --> 13:13.717
And now Ryan's back and...

13:15.397 --> 13:17.597
- I don't know what to do.
- Well, just explain it to him.

13:17.677 --> 13:23.637
He left. And suddenly there was a hot,
hot yard guy in the yard, who is hot.

13:24.477 --> 13:26.077
So you really didn't do anything wrong.

13:26.157 --> 13:28.717
If I didn't do anything wrong,
then why do I have to tell him?

13:28.957 --> 13:31.677
Well, if it really is over with DJ,
then I guess you don't.

13:33.117 --> 13:35.997
Come on, let's go get you some
coffee with actual coffee in it.

13:45.156 --> 13:46.516
Two coffees, please, black.

13:47.636 --> 13:49.276
You're going to lose that hand, Sanford.

13:49.356 --> 13:51.716
Since when is scotch a part of your nutritious brunch?

13:51.836 --> 13:56.436
Since the DA's office finally decided
they had enough to indict me.

13:56.996 --> 13:59.036
So what did they finally decide to charge you with?

13:59.116 --> 14:03.396
Bribing certain city officials
to obtain building permits.

14:03.516 --> 14:04.556
Oh, that's a new one.

14:05.036 --> 14:06.156
Is there any truth in it?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.436
Please. Why would I need to bribe anyone, hmm?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.516
- Oh, yeah, I own this town.
- Sure you do. You bought it.

14:14.516 --> 14:19.596
All right, I admit that I have done
some things that I'm not too proud of,

14:19.676 --> 14:22.516
but I did not do what they are accusing me of.

14:22.876 --> 14:24.476
Well, then they'll have no case.

14:24.876 --> 14:27.916
What they do have, however, are documents:

14:28.596 --> 14:32.596
bank statements showing large sums of money
being transferred from the Newport Group

14:32.676 --> 14:34.396
to the City Councilman's office.

14:35.356 --> 14:36.836
Well, how, how is that possible?

14:38.156 --> 14:39.396
I don't know.

14:43.036 --> 14:43.796
Will you help me?

14:46.436 --> 14:47.036
How?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.596
I was hoping you could tell me that.

14:58.036 --> 14:58.596
Hey.

14:59.276 --> 15:01.796
- Yeah, okay, sorry I'm late.
- No, no, you're right on time, buddy.

15:01.916 --> 15:04.676
We're just getting started. Ryan,
would you please take the minutes?

15:06.076 --> 15:08.396
- Seth, it's just us.
- Yeah, uh-huh, write that down.

15:09.036 --> 15:12.916
I now call to order this year's first
Harbor School Comic Book League meeting.

15:13.036 --> 15:16.116
Members include Seth Cohen... present.

15:16.276 --> 15:18.036
- Ryan Atwood.
- Seth, if it's just...

15:18.076 --> 15:19.436
Ryan Atwood.

15:21.596 --> 15:24.076
Present. Seth, if it's just you and me,
can we maybe do this at home?

15:24.156 --> 15:25.876
Yeah, we could, but then we wouldn't
get our pictures in the yearbook.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.076
That might not be such a bad thing.

15:27.156 --> 15:29.796
Maybe you couldn't undermine me in
front of the league. What about that?

15:29.876 --> 15:32.236
Hey, I'm here for the comic book club.

15:33.636 --> 15:35.156
- You are?
- You are?

15:35.276 --> 15:36.516
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

15:36.716 --> 15:41.116
- Um, because you're on the water polo team?
- What's that supposed to mean?

15:43.796 --> 15:47.636
Okay, you want to talk comics, guy, let's talk comics.

15:48.916 --> 15:51.156
- What day of the week do new comic books come out on?
- Wednesday.

15:51.236 --> 15:52.996
- What's Wonder Woman's secret identity?
- She doesn't have one.

15:53.116 --> 15:55.716
- True, which I think is a mistake, by the way.
- I know, me, too.

15:56.316 --> 15:59.436
- Who's your favorite superhero?
- Depends who's writing him,
but I'd have to say Superman.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.596
- Superman. This guy, he's too perfect, guy.
- No.

16:04.796 --> 16:06.356
He seems perfect, but he's not.

16:06.836 --> 16:09.916
I mean, if you think about it,
he's actually kind of messed up.

16:09.996 --> 16:13.636
I mean, he lost his parents.
He lost his whole planet.
He's like totally alone.

16:13.716 --> 16:16.476
And this is a guy who could take over
the world if he wanted, but he doesn't.

16:16.516 --> 16:18.916
He just keeps helping people.
Why would he do that, you know?

16:19.276 --> 16:21.956
Unless he was trying to make a connection.

16:22.476 --> 16:24.356
Trying to, like, find his way home.

16:26.836 --> 16:28.396
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.

16:29.596 --> 16:31.836
- Well, hot damn, welcome to the club.
- Thanks.

16:31.876 --> 16:34.156
- This is going to be good.
- Today's topics, we have some topics...

16:34.396 --> 16:35.636
The Hulk. He gets bigger.

16:35.756 --> 16:39.796
All his clothes rip off except... his pants. Why is that?

16:39.876 --> 16:41.876
- From now on we'll meet up every Wednesday...
- Yes.

16:41.916 --> 16:43.236
- Hit the comic book store.
- Yes.

16:43.276 --> 16:44.756
- And then we'll hang out.
- That will be awesome.

16:45.196 --> 16:47.396
I'll hit you with those Green Lantern JPEGs, all right?

16:47.436 --> 16:48.316
Yeah, definitely do that.

16:49.556 --> 16:50.996
- Dude, I love that guy.
- Yeah.

16:52.356 --> 16:55.076
Whoa. You're not the only one.

16:59.356 --> 17:00.316
What's going on?

17:02.276 --> 17:04.836
No, she cannot be dating him. That's not even possible.

17:04.915 --> 17:07.076
- How is that possible?
- A second ago you wanted to date him.

17:07.116 --> 17:09.756
Yeah, that's because he's me.
You see what she's doing, don't you?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.915
She's basically dating the WASP version of me.
It's so stupid.

17:12.996 --> 17:15.276
- What, you think Zach is...
- Yeah, I actually do... Look at him!

17:15.356 --> 17:17.796
He's like, what, the conventionally attractive, you know,

17:17.836 --> 17:22.675
athletic, confident, just, completely non-neurotic,

17:23.356 --> 17:25.476
WASP version of me.

17:36.636 --> 17:39.076
So there it is- the haunted mansion.

17:39.196 --> 17:41.396
Damn, I am definitely not in Chino anymore.

17:45.196 --> 17:49.516
- So have you talked to Theresa at all since...
- Since we lost the baby? No.

17:51.116 --> 17:53.596
But we didn't really talk a whole
lot while I was there, either.

17:54.476 --> 17:57.836
So you weren't really a couple? I mean, you never...

17:57.916 --> 18:02.276
No, no, uh, it wasn't really like that... at all.

18:06.676 --> 18:11.716
So uh, what about you? You... dating anybody?

18:12.916 --> 18:16.116
Uh, no. I'm not dating anybody.

18:16.876 --> 18:18.956
Okay, so if you're not dating anyone,

18:19.036 --> 18:22.076
maybe you would want to go to the
kickoff carnival with me tomorrow?

18:23.516 --> 18:25.716
Hmm, well, I don't know. Can we go on the Ferris wheel?

18:25.796 --> 18:27.516
Because my last boyfriend was afraid of heights.

18:28.036 --> 18:29.956
Poor guy, didn't know what he was missing.

18:37.836 --> 18:40.156
Come on, I can't wait for you to see the rest of the house.

18:40.356 --> 18:42.636
And the look on my mom's face when she sees you in it.

18:44.796 --> 18:48.476
- You got a job?
- No, it's not just a job.

18:48.676 --> 18:50.836
It's a whole new career... in fashion.

18:50.956 --> 18:53.036
- Hailey...
- In sales.

18:53.156 --> 18:54.156
Hailey!

18:55.036 --> 18:56.676
- In Japan.
- Oy!

18:56.916 --> 18:58.356
How's Jimmy doing with that?

18:58.756 --> 19:00.836
He's great. He doesn't know.

19:00.956 --> 19:01.676
Hailey.

19:01.796 --> 19:03.676
I tried to tell him, but he just seems so...

19:04.796 --> 19:06.116
happy all the time.

19:06.556 --> 19:11.476
He's making so much money on the market that
all he wants to do is drink and sail and go to Cabo.

19:11.556 --> 19:12.556
You poor thing.

19:13.396 --> 19:16.676
- I'm too young for early retirement.
- And you're too old to keep running away.

19:16.716 --> 19:18.036
I'm not running this time.

19:18.556 --> 19:22.756
I have a shot to make a real future
out of this. Jimmy just seems kind of...

19:23.876 --> 19:24.676
stuck.

19:25.756 --> 19:26.556
He loves you.

19:28.556 --> 19:29.516
I love him, too.

19:30.156 --> 19:31.156
Then you have to tell him.

19:35.036 --> 19:38.436
- I can walk on my own, you know.
- Yeah, when you're not drunk.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.476
Oh, no, you're all right. You're fine.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.596
- Oh, my God. Cal?
- Oh, I spoke too soon.

19:45.716 --> 19:47.156
What's the matter with him? Is he all right?

19:48.156 --> 19:49.396
Did he have a stroke?

19:49.676 --> 19:50.756
I'm fine.

19:51.956 --> 19:54.196
He, uh, had a bottle of scotch.

19:54.476 --> 19:57.916
- You got him drunk?
- No, I took him to lunch to try to get him sober.

19:57.956 --> 20:00.716
I am not... drunk.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.756
Somebody tell me what's going on.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.236
- Cal.
- I'm going to bed.

20:05.356 --> 20:08.156
The pleasure was all yours, Sanford. Enjoy.

20:12.876 --> 20:15.636
- You may want to sit down.
- You may want to just tell me.

20:16.796 --> 20:18.596
Caleb is going to be indicted.

20:18.716 --> 20:22.876
I don't know when, but the DA's office
has been investigating him for...

20:23.516 --> 20:24.796
for a while now.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.676
For how long?

20:27.876 --> 20:31.316
How long have they been investigating him, Sandy?

20:32.556 --> 20:34.196
Since before the wedding?

20:35.596 --> 20:37.636
Son of a bitch.

20:37.716 --> 20:40.756
Well, you know, he didn't want to worry you.

20:41.716 --> 20:42.836
Is he going to jail?

20:42.876 --> 20:47.036
Well, they're accusing him of bribing
city officials, and, apparently, they have proof.

20:48.796 --> 20:51.156
- I wish there was something I could do.
- No, you don't.

20:51.716 --> 20:54.516
You despise him, you despise me,
and you would love nothing more

20:54.556 --> 20:56.956
than to see us get exactly what we deserve, right?

20:57.036 --> 20:59.436
- No, Julie, no.
- Let me tell you something.

20:59.756 --> 21:02.916
If Caleb's going down, you'd better
believe Kirsten's going with him.

21:02.996 --> 21:07.156
So you'd better come up with something,
or it won't be just my kids who lose everything.

21:09.516 --> 21:12.276
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go take care of my husband.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.800
- How's it going?
- Oh, let me help you with that.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.760
- How was your first day at school?
- Uh... it was all right, actually.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.400
How'd it go with Miss Fisher? Is that your assignment?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.320
- Oh, she told you about that?
- Yeah.

21:33.480 --> 21:39.080
Yeah, she called to tell me that
she wants us all to sit down and
start talking about colleges for you.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.760
- Ryan, that is just fantastic.
- Where the hell are you going?

21:41.800 --> 21:45.000
- You're paying me to work, aren't you?
- I thought I was. I thought I was.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.560
- Ryan! Did you tell her?
- Uh, no, but...

21:46.640 --> 21:49.320
Ryan figured out why there is still
no wall in our former family room.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.000
- There's no wall because...
- Because this genius misread the blueprints

21:52.040 --> 21:54.720
and ordered the wrong size steel
I-beam, and then was hoping

21:54.760 --> 21:57.600
we wouldn't notice while he bills us for
all the time it's going to take to get it right.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.240
- We're doing other things.
- You're drinking our coffee, eating our bagels.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.000
- Taking your kids to school.
- Look, I ordered the right I-beam.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.280
They just delivered the wrong one.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.040
Archie, I get that, but, uh,
can I ask you something, man?

22:07.160 --> 22:12.040
If... if you just move the new
wall out about ten inches,
couldn't you just use the I-beam that you got?

22:12.560 --> 22:14.600
- You an architect, kid?
- No, but I worked a little construction...

22:14.680 --> 22:18.080
- Then don't tell me how to do my job.
- You have no right to talk to him like that.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.200
How come there's still couches
in my kitchen? You said you'd be out
of here by dinnertime.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.000
- What are you looking for, another free meal?
- You want us gone, we're gone.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.600
Get your little construction worker
here to finish the job for you.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.720
- Archie, don't go!
- No, no, no. Thanks for the coffee.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.760
Please!

22:30.680 --> 22:32.240
Sandy, apologize.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.920
I have nothing to apologize to him for. Nothing.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.440
And I am sick to death of putting myself on
the line for this family and getting nothing.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.360
Do you want to apologize? Apologize. I'm done.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.560
I'll call Archie and apologize.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.680
No.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.400
You're right. He should have told us about the beams.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.040
I'll call a new contractor in the morning.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.920
I know I wasn't the easiest
person to live with this summer.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.040
I was just really upset about the boys being gone...

23:34.080 --> 23:35.720
and I took it out on you.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.920
I'm sorry.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.480
You know...

23:47.600 --> 23:50.880
what I said in there- it wasn't about you.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.960
- Thank God, 'cause you were scary.
- Really? I was scary?

23:56.080 --> 24:01.240
Yeah. I mean, I've never seen you go off
on anyone like that, except for my dad, and...

24:02.880 --> 24:04.880
Oh, no. What did he do now?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.360
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.480
You missed all the drama.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.960
It's all right. I think I got my quota for the day.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.120
How'd it go with you and Marissa?

24:23.200 --> 24:26.200
She's gonna go to the kick-off carnival with
me tomorrow. You want to come with?

24:26.800 --> 24:30.560
Hang out with you and Marissa and Summer and Zach?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.520
Is that really how it's gonna be from now on?

24:34.880 --> 24:35.880
Probably, I don't know.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.840
Well, great. Can never hang out with you again. See ya.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.800
Come on, why not? Doesn't mean we can't all be friends.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.120
Dude, do you really think Summer's going to
want to be friends with me, after what I did to her?

24:43.360 --> 24:46.040
Especially now that she has a Zach
attack? The guy's like Superman.

24:46.080 --> 24:46.720
He's not Superman.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.480
He's like the thoroughbred, and
I'm the monkey with cymbals.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.000
All right, so what are you going to do?
You gonna spend a whole year with Captain Oats?

24:54.080 --> 24:55.720
- It's not like I have any choice.
- Of course you do.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.240
Just pick up the phone. Call her. Look, be her friend.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.080
I can't, man. It's too late.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.320
She's not going to want to
hear anything I have to say.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.200
Okay.

25:19.760 --> 25:24.640
So, what happened was, Susie and
I were roommates in Santa Cruz.

25:25.280 --> 25:29.280
Until we dropped out of college to
start our own fashion line.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.680
You had your own fashion line?

25:31.840 --> 25:36.680
No, because we took all my dad's
money and moved to Paris and partied
until I had to move back.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.120
Oh. Now that is the American dream.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.480
But Susie stayed in Paris.

25:41.720 --> 25:45.640
She got a job at Chanel and just
sold her first collection to a company in Japan.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.960
- Well, here's to Susie.
- To Susie...

25:49.160 --> 25:52.840
who asked me to be her sales rep and move to Japan.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.720
More wine?

25:56.640 --> 25:58.240
She asked you to move to Japan?

25:59.480 --> 26:00.400
I know, right?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.280
So...

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
what did you say?

26:04.240 --> 26:07.560
I said I'd... talk to you about it.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.800
You're asking me to move to Japan?

26:11.200 --> 26:12.000
No.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.520
You've got your kids. You have a whole life here,

26:15.680 --> 26:20.840
and being with you has made me realize that
I want all that. I want a job. I want a future.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.720
- I don't want to run away anymore.
- Well, then don't.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.640
- You can have all that here.
- I can't. The money's in Japan.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.400
- So, I'll... I'll back you.
- No. Jimmy, I can't take your money.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.680
It wouldn't be my money. It'd be, it'd be our money.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.440
Marry me.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.160
What?

26:38.560 --> 26:42.520
Look, I've had and lost enough jobs to know
that the only thing that's important in this life

26:42.560 --> 26:47.320
are the people in it and I want you... in my life, Hailey.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.760
I want to marry you.

26:52.800 --> 26:57.680
Happy, high vibrations attract happy,
high vibrational circumstances.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.320
Yucky, low vibrations attract...

27:01.440 --> 27:04.520
- I'm doing my homework!
- ... yucky low vibrational circumstances.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.040
It's, it's the same principle as...

27:07.440 --> 27:11.320
You know, if I fail Intro to Pre Calc
this semester all because of you...

27:11.600 --> 27:12.880
Ryan? Uh...

27:13.480 --> 27:15.960
I'm sorry. I thought you were the evil stepmonster.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.440
She let me in. She seems nice.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.960
Yeah, well, she just switched
antidepressants. Give it a day.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.840
- Can I come in?
- Sure... Wait.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.200
- Did Cohen send you?
- No. No, he has no idea I'm here.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.960
- So.
- So.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.520
- You just in the neighborhood?
- No. Uh...

27:44.080 --> 27:47.360
- I owe you an apology.
- It's my fault Seth took off last summer.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.840
Oh, Ryan, stop it. It's so not.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
No. If I hadn't left, then you
guys would still be together.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.560
That is not true. He would have found
some Coheny way to break us up.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.640
He can't help it. He's Cohen.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.480
Come.

28:00.120 --> 28:00.720
Sit.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.360
Okay, um...

28:07.760 --> 28:10.480
Look, I know you have a boyfriend.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.400
What? Whoa. No, who told you that?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.880
- I thought you told Seth that.
- Well, yeah, to torture him.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.160
No, see, Zach and I, we're just
hanging out. He is not my boyfriend.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.600
I do not want a boyfriend, okay?
I had a boyfriend. He sailed away.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.880
Which was wrong, but...

28:23.120 --> 28:28.240
but he cares about you so much, and if you could,
if you could just give him another chance,

28:28.280 --> 28:32.200
then maybe we could all go back
to the way that we were?

28:33.640 --> 28:34.400
How?

28:35.280 --> 28:38.000
You guys just left. For three months.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.240
You moved on. I moved on. Marissa moved on.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.320
What?

28:44.920 --> 28:47.440
I mean the way we were wasn't always so great.

28:47.560 --> 28:51.880
You guys had to deal with Marissa's
mom, Luke, Oliver, Theresa...

28:51.960 --> 28:54.360
and Cohen and I never should have hooked up.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.200
Look, just trust me on this.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Things are the way they are for a reason.
You should go talk to Marissa.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.280
You can't keep calling me, DJ.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.200
You shouldn't even be here right now.
We're in the middle of dinner.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.080
Who is he?

29:19.160 --> 29:21.480
He was my boyfriend.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.640
So you're back together now?

29:26.280 --> 29:28.600
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't look sorry when you were kissing him.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.840
- That's not fair.
- Don't talk to me about fair!

29:33.000 --> 29:36.800
- What were you doing with me all summer?
- I know, but he's my boyfriend.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.280
- And I'm the yard guy, right?
- DJ, come on.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.520
You don't think I hear the way you
talk about me around your friends?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.960
- We agreed we wouldn't tell anyone.
- Because I'm the yard guy.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.560
Because you could get fired.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.000
You know what? I quit. Have fun
explaining that to your mom.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.040
DJ, wait. I'm not like that.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.000
You know I'm not like that.

29:56.080 --> 29:56.960
Please.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.880
Hey. Don't cry.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.080
Please, don't cry.

30:26.768 --> 30:30.048
So I pull in the driveway,
and Marissa is full-on making out with
some guy I've never seen before.

30:31.088 --> 30:33.528
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I drove off.

30:34.768 --> 30:36.968
I guess you should have called first.

30:37.568 --> 30:39.528
She said she wasn't dating anyone, you know?

30:39.608 --> 30:41.808
Maybe she's not. Maybe, you know,
they just hook up for sex.

30:42.328 --> 30:46.528
I'm sorry. I'm just distracted. Listen,
man, I cannot believe you talked to Summer for me.

30:46.608 --> 30:49.648
Dude, thank you. That was just above and beyond you.

30:50.328 --> 30:52.008
- Now you just have to help me get her back.
- Seth.

30:52.128 --> 30:55.528
- She said she wants to try again.
- Yeah, as friends.

30:55.608 --> 30:58.328
Ryan, come on. Why would she go
through all the trouble of telling you

30:58.408 --> 31:01.768
that Zach is specifically not her boyfriend
if she just wanted us to be friends?

31:01.808 --> 31:05.128
Seth, why would she go through all the trouble of telling
you she just wants to be friends if she doesn't?

31:05.208 --> 31:08.328
Because she's hurt and she's scared
and she's hiding behind walls.

31:08.408 --> 31:12.288
Yeah, and I will bring those walls
down with one single grand gesture.

31:12.368 --> 31:15.368
- No. No grand gestures. No.
- Yes, yes, I'm afraid it is time once again for me

31:15.448 --> 31:18.408
to stand on that proverbial coffee
cart and declare my love for her.

31:18.768 --> 31:21.408
Maybe I'll do it at the carnival. You know what
I'm saying? Maybe it'll be a hot dog stand.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.288
Okay, all right, all right. What
do I do about Marissa?

31:25.928 --> 31:27.528
I don't know. I mean, what do you want to do?

31:28.048 --> 31:29.168
You sound like Miss Fisher.

31:29.648 --> 31:31.848
Ahh! Forgot to finish the assignment.

31:32.208 --> 31:36.168
Hey. Yeah, you see where this
is going? This is good. Look.

31:36.288 --> 31:39.248
Marissa's distracting you from school again.
Summer and I are getting back together.

31:39.328 --> 31:43.848
The thing is, by the end of kick-off carnival,
the four of us, we're gonna be exactly
the way we were.

31:46.128 --> 31:47.968
Dad, what are you doing here?

31:48.128 --> 31:50.648
- He's having breakfast.
- Julie's not talking to me.

31:50.728 --> 31:55.408
She left me a note to say she's booked herself into
the Montage for a $3,000 spa weekend.

31:55.488 --> 31:59.208
But you get the Sandy Cohen
lox scramble with rye toast.

31:59.968 --> 32:03.888
So are you here to see Sandy so
he can bail you out again?

32:05.128 --> 32:08.248
No, I'm not dragging Sandy into anything.

32:09.008 --> 32:13.168
Before he put these eggs in front of me,
he was the closest thing I have to
a friend in this town.

32:14.688 --> 32:16.328
I came to apologize, Kiki.

32:19.568 --> 32:22.808
And to ask you to remember that
whatever happens in that courtroom,

32:23.288 --> 32:25.128
I did what I did for this family.

32:29.328 --> 32:30.768
I should go.

32:31.608 --> 32:33.928
- Where to?
- Probably interviewing lawyers all day.

32:34.008 --> 32:37.128
Then I imagine I'll be at home
tonight shredding documents.

32:37.248 --> 32:38.288
Oh, don't do that.

32:38.688 --> 32:41.528
Have dinner with us instead. I won't cook. I promise.

32:41.608 --> 32:45.408
Although if Kirsten's mad enough at you... she might.

32:45.928 --> 32:47.208
I don't want to be any trouble.

32:49.648 --> 32:50.568
We'll order in.

32:56.848 --> 33:00.048
So, so the thing is, I'm not really a writer at all.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.648
Words are kind of not my thing.

33:03.408 --> 33:05.728
Obviously. Uh... So maybe if I had some more time...

33:05.848 --> 33:06.648
What is this?

33:07.288 --> 33:09.928
What I was doing when I should have
been doing what you asked me to do?

33:10.168 --> 33:13.248
Yeah, but, uh, what is it?

33:13.648 --> 33:15.368
It's, uh, the Cohens' new family room.

33:15.688 --> 33:20.288
Uh, actually, that's... that's what
it should have looked like,

33:20.368 --> 33:22.408
but the contractor kind of didn't
know what he was doing.

33:22.488 --> 33:23.768
Could I see your schedule, please?

33:25.208 --> 33:26.048
Yeah.

33:27.008 --> 33:30.648
Because we're going to need
to get you into some advanced math
and science classes.

33:31.328 --> 33:35.848
- Some calculus, physics...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh... why?

33:36.408 --> 33:39.368
You'll need them if you want to become an architect.

33:41.128 --> 33:42.488
Isn't that what you want?

33:52.168 --> 33:53.248
- Hey.
- You taking off?

33:53.488 --> 33:55.328
Yeah, Dad's coming over for dinner tonight.

33:55.408 --> 33:59.488
I left a message on Hailey's cell,
inviting you guys,
but I never heard back.

33:59.608 --> 34:02.168
That's 'cause she's probably halfway to Japan by now.

34:03.248 --> 34:06.008
- Did she at least tell you or...?
- Yeah. No, she told me. Yeah.

34:06.368 --> 34:11.248
I just didn't listen. I asked her to marry me instead.

34:11.728 --> 34:12.928
Oh, Jimmy.

34:14.368 --> 34:17.168
No, it's good. It's good, it's... It's,
you know, I'm happy for her.

34:17.288 --> 34:19.648
It's, you know, it's what she always wanted, so.

34:20.527 --> 34:24.248
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

34:24.328 --> 34:27.088
I thought I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with Hailey.

34:28.928 --> 34:31.168
- It was... it was fun.
- I'm sure.

34:31.688 --> 34:35.568
Living on a yacht, drinking all day,
sailing off to Cabo.

34:35.728 --> 34:37.568
How come when you say it, it sounds bad?

34:40.128 --> 34:40.928
Listen to me.

34:41.248 --> 34:44.648
You can do whatever you want with your life,
but you're not going to waste it.

34:45.088 --> 34:46.007
Won't let you.

34:46.888 --> 34:48.248
Hailey's made her move.

34:50.007 --> 34:50.848
What's yours?

34:59.208 --> 35:02.088
- We could just not go.
- We can't not go; we're here.

35:06.128 --> 35:08.368
Look at them. Oblivious, having fun.

35:08.808 --> 35:12.728
To them it's all funnel cakes and fried Snickers
 just a chance to mingle it up

35:12.768 --> 35:16.088
with the carney folk and win a really
awesome stuffed sock monkey.

35:16.168 --> 35:16.728
But for us?

35:16.848 --> 35:21.248
But for us, kickoff carnival usually determines
the course of our romantic lives for the entire year.

35:21.328 --> 35:24.448
- No pressure.
- No, we did good last year. We did okay.

35:25.128 --> 35:29.288
You kissed Marissa on the Ferris wheel,
Summer threw up on my shoes.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.648
I think I know how she felt.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.088
I'm going to go find a hot dog
stand to climb. Good luck.

35:52.928 --> 35:55.408
- I was going to tell you.
- No, you weren't.

35:55.728 --> 35:57.968
- I asked you point-blank, and you lied.
- I didn't lie.

35:58.048 --> 35:59.368
- Marissa...
- What was I supposed to do?

35:59.448 --> 36:01.768
Wait for you? You weren't coming back.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.928
I wanted you to tell me the truth.

36:09.128 --> 36:13.928
His name is DJ. He works for my parents,
so we had to keep it a secret from everyone.

36:16.128 --> 36:17.888
We're not seeing each other anymore.

36:18.008 --> 36:20.248
After last night when he found out about me, right?

36:23.728 --> 36:25.728
Look, I'm sorry. For right now, we should...

36:27.128 --> 36:28.368
we should just be friends.

36:29.128 --> 36:30.088
Friends?

36:30.688 --> 36:33.648
Ryan, we're not friends. We were never just friends.

36:33.728 --> 36:35.248
I guess that solves the problem, then.

36:35.448 --> 36:36.208
See ya.

36:40.608 --> 36:43.168
So what'll it be? Funnel cake or fried Snickers?

36:43.288 --> 36:45.448
- Uh, bottled water.
- What?

36:45.728 --> 36:47.888
You can't come to a carnival
and just have bottled water.

36:48.048 --> 36:50.208
No, I meant with the funnel cake and the Snickers.

36:51.688 --> 36:52.488
What?

37:13.088 --> 37:15.728
Cohen... what are you doing?

37:15.808 --> 37:17.728
Nothing. Why?

37:17.808 --> 37:19.248
Well, it looks like you're humping the hot dog stand.

37:19.328 --> 37:22.488
No, actually, Summer, I'm not even humping anything.

37:22.568 --> 37:26.328
You know how I love to stand
on countertops in public places.

37:26.368 --> 37:29.048
- You know, hot dog stands, coffee carts.
- Oh, no.

37:29.088 --> 37:30.848
- Because Summer Roberts...
- Cohen, do not!

37:30.928 --> 37:32.488
- I love you!
- What?

37:34.088 --> 37:34.928
Hi, Zach. How's it going?

37:35.008 --> 37:37.968
Zach, don't listen to him. He's crazy.
He reads comic books.

37:38.288 --> 37:40.088
- I know. So do I.
- You do?

37:42.048 --> 37:44.968
Zach, listen. I really hope that
this doesn't affect the league.

37:45.008 --> 37:46.728
It's just that Summer and I sort of have a history.

37:46.808 --> 37:50.088
- But no future! We are leaving.
- Wait. Hang on a second.
Just hear me out for a second.

37:50.168 --> 37:53.408
- Cohen, back off. I mean it.
- Fine, just hear me out for, like, one second.

37:53.488 --> 37:57.008
Seth, she said back off. Please?

38:05.328 --> 38:08.328
- You all right?
- No, but I have not yet begun to fight, Ryan,

38:08.648 --> 38:10.288
or grovel, should it come to that.

38:17.288 --> 38:19.728
Oh, my God. Cohen?!

38:21.648 --> 38:24.488
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:24.688 --> 38:25.408
- God!
- Ow!

38:25.488 --> 38:29.008
What the hell do you think
you're doing! This isn't a game, Cohen!
You could've gotten hurt!

38:29.048 --> 38:29.888
Good thing I didn't.

38:34.048 --> 38:35.768
What do you want from me, Cohen?

38:37.368 --> 38:38.528
I just want you.

38:40.848 --> 38:42.448
No, you don't.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.488
You had me.

38:45.488 --> 38:50.768
You had me at Chrismukkah
in a frigging Wonder Woman costume,
and you chose Anna.

38:51.328 --> 38:53.808
You had me three months ago, and you left.

38:53.888 --> 38:56.608
- I want to make that up to you.
- It has nothing to do with me.

38:56.728 --> 38:59.968
It is about you, and it is always about you,

39:00.008 --> 39:02.128
what you need and what you want, you know?

39:02.208 --> 39:05.248
It seems that you only want me when you can't have me.

39:07.728 --> 39:09.808
You like the chase, and that's all.

39:10.488 --> 39:13.128
So you know what? You can have it.

39:14.888 --> 39:15.968
I'm going home.

39:30.688 --> 39:32.248
All right, man, let's go home.

39:42.048 --> 39:44.448
Hey, guys. You're home early.

39:44.808 --> 39:47.208
Um, you hungry? There's some moo shoo left.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.568
- You want some?
- Grandpa, you eating on the floor?

39:50.688 --> 39:52.128
Yes, it has come to this.

39:52.448 --> 39:55.968
Unfortunately, the family room
is still stuck inside the kitchen.

39:56.048 --> 39:58.208
- How was school?
- It was really good. I'm never going back.

39:58.288 --> 40:01.488
- Ah, just what a father likes to hear.
- Yeah. Ryan broke up with Marissa again.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.168
- Oh, Summer broke up with Seth again.
- Zach will never talk to us again.

40:04.328 --> 40:05.328
- Who?
- New guy.

40:05.448 --> 40:07.048
- I'll get it.
- But on the plus side, you know,

40:07.128 --> 40:11.488
Ryan he's taking AP physics;
he's taking AP math; and this
moo shoo looks delicious.

40:11.568 --> 40:12.928
- It's really good.
- Caleb Nichol?

40:14.208 --> 40:15.808
Sir, you're under arrest.

40:17.128 --> 40:17.968
Gentlemen...

40:21.488 --> 40:23.848
- What took you so long?
- You have the right to remain silent.

40:23.928 --> 40:27.048
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

40:27.088 --> 40:30.368
You have the right to an
attorney and to have that attorney
present during questioning.

40:30.408 --> 40:31.048
What's going on?

40:31.488 --> 40:34.088
- Your father will explain it.
- Dad, I'm so sorry.

40:35.168 --> 40:37.288
You have absolutely nothing to apologize for.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.928
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

40:39.128 --> 40:40.368
Put your hands behind your head.

40:48.608 --> 40:51.328
Don't say anything. I'll follow
you to the station. I'm his lawyer.
