I didn't mean to hit you.

Please, please open up, Harry!

00:15.135 --> 00:17.037

<i>I, uh, heard about Nola.</i>

00:17.137 --> 00:18.398
<i>Is she all right?</i>

00:18.498 --> 00:21.721
You, uh, you probably heard
she tried to commit suicide.

00:21.821 --> 00:22.682
Yes, I did.

00:22.782 --> 00:23.923
[Reverend]:
She had a headache,

00:24.023 --> 00:25.925
and she picked up
the wrong medicine.

00:29.788 --> 00:30.689
Why don't you
write the truth

00:30.789 --> 00:32.611
about that twisted
son of a bitch,

00:32.711 --> 00:34.853
'cause he killed Nola.

00:34.953 --> 00:37.335

00:37.435 --> 00:38.737
Mom, I don't think he's coming.

00:38.837 --> 00:40.258
Of course he is.

00:54.091 --> 00:56.513
we're gonna put your book out

00:56.613 --> 00:57.994
That means you have

00:59.095 --> 01:00.517
I'm sorry, a month and a half?

That's... that's...
that's insane.

01:02.178 --> 01:03.279
You do this for me, right,

01:03.379 --> 01:05.161
I will rip up your old contract,

01:11.106 --> 01:12.368
I'm investigating

01:12.468 --> 01:14.129
the death of
Nola Kellergan.

01:14.229 --> 01:16.772
Now, a witness saw her

your chauffeur's car

01:18.153 --> 01:20.095
several times
the summer she disappeared.

01:20.195 --> 01:22.937
My chauffeur, Luther Caleb,

01:23.037 --> 01:24.779
was a brave and honest man.

01:24.879 --> 01:26.941
You have your killer,
Mr. Goldman.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.662
Well, I'm not convinced
of his guilt,

Who else knew
about Nola and Harry

02:57.484 --> 02:58.745
besides Mrs. Quinn,

02:58.845 --> 03:00.306
and then, why didn't
Chief Pratt question Harry

03:00.406 --> 03:01.267

03:01.367 --> 03:02.468

Sweetie, who am I gonna tell?

Yeah, look, Mom,
I should go, okay?

03:10.095 --> 03:11.717
I'll talk to you later.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.819
Hey, thanks for listening.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.842
I told you to wait!

Wait for what,
Sergeant?

03:17.822 --> 03:19.244
Evidence to fall
from the sky?

03:19.344 --> 03:22.046
Look, all I did
was pay him a visit, okay?

03:22.146 --> 03:24.388
Look what I found in his house.

03:27.792 --> 03:28.773
It's a nude painting.

03:28.873 --> 03:30.935
Look closer,
Sherlock.

03:31.035 --> 03:32.056
[sighs]

03:32.156 --> 03:33.497
Yeah, that's
a naked painting

03:33.597 --> 03:35.178
of Nola Kellergan

03:35.278 --> 03:36.179

03:42.125 --> 03:44.147
When I brought him up,
Stern went radio silent.

03:44.247 --> 03:45.948
You searched his house
without authorization.

03:46.048 --> 03:46.909
Those photos are illegal.

03:47.009 --> 03:47.750
Inadmissible.

03:47.850 --> 03:48.711
No, no, no.

03:48.811 --> 03:49.912
You can still go after him.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.014
I mean, he doesn't know
I've seen the paintings.

03:57.098 --> 03:59.080
All right, um...

03:59.180 --> 04:01.002
Hmm.

04:01.102 --> 04:02.443
All right, talk
to your friend, Quebert.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.685
See what he knows about Stern

04:03.785 --> 04:04.806
and his relationship

04:04.906 --> 04:05.967
to the dead girl.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.728
I'll look into the chauffeur.

04:09.029 --> 04:10.371
he's been in love with
for three decades

04:10.471 --> 04:12.472

11:38.521 --> 11:39.582
Excuse me.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.224
Harry!

11:41.324 --> 11:42.425
My goodness,
is everything okay?

11:42.525 --> 11:43.706
You're sweating.

11:43.806 --> 11:45.067
Oh, no.
Yes, I'm fine.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.148
It's just, uh--
excuse me--

11:46.248 --> 11:48.230
It's very... very warm.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.232
Corduroy pants
at a Summer Gala...

11:50.332 --> 11:51.753
I'll have them turn up the air.

11:51.853 --> 11:53.075
Come.

11:53.175 --> 11:54.396
I've put you
at the head table,

11:54.496 --> 11:55.677
where everyone can see

11:55.777 --> 11:57.959
our famous
New York celebrity.

11:58.059 --> 11:59.561
Harry Quebert,

11:59.661 --> 12:01.362
allow me to present
Elijah Stern,

12:01.462 --> 12:02.964
who generously
funds this gala.

12:03.064 --> 12:04.245
Oh.

12:04.345 --> 12:05.106
He also owns the house
you're renting

12:05.186 --> 12:06.647
at Goose Cove.

12:06.747 --> 12:08.249
Now, you two
get acquainted

12:08.349 --> 12:10.330
while I find
the rest of our table.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.291
Yes, well, my landlord.

12:11.391 --> 12:13.133
Mr. Stern. Pleasure.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.254
Elijah, please.

12:14.354 --> 12:16.336
[band begins playing]

12:16.436 --> 12:17.577

12:17.677 --> 12:19.899

the estimable author

12:19.999 --> 12:21.701
who has the whole
town talking.

12:21.801 --> 12:23.703
Oh, is that so?

12:23.803 --> 12:25.264
You really do.

12:25.364 --> 12:26.265
Thank you,
well, that's...

12:26.365 --> 12:28.107
They speak of little else.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.148
Ah, well...

12:29.248 --> 12:32.170
[âªâªâªâªâª]

12:47.464 --> 12:48.846
I understand
you're spending your time

12:48.946 --> 12:49.887
at Goose Cove

12:49.987 --> 12:51.168
working on a new book.

12:51.268 --> 12:52.409
Yes, I am.

12:52.509 --> 12:55.172
It's a romantic novel,

12:55.272 --> 12:56.973
a bit slow-going
at the moment.

12:57.073 --> 12:59.075
Are you in love?

13:00.316 --> 13:01.698
Why do you ask that?

13:01.798 --> 13:02.819
Well...

13:02.919 --> 13:04.500
I just wondered
if you had to be in love

13:04.600 --> 13:05.821
in order to write
a love story.

13:05.921 --> 13:06.902
Hmm.

13:07.002 --> 13:09.785
I'd wanted to be a writer
myself, or...

13:09.885 --> 13:12.147
an artist of any kind.

13:12.247 --> 13:15.270
In school, I wrote
one or two things,

13:15.370 --> 13:17.912
and they were
so lamentably bad

13:18.012 --> 13:19.314
that I was encouraged

13:19.414 --> 13:21.516
to try almost anything else,

13:21.616 --> 13:23.558
and as we came from
a certain amount of money,

13:23.658 --> 13:26.200
and an established business,

13:26.300 --> 13:28.442
I was encouraged
to go into that

13:28.542 --> 13:30.604
and not to follow
my artistic spirit

13:30.704 --> 13:32.706
any farther.

13:33.266 --> 13:35.268
What kind of a love story is it?

13:37.030 --> 13:39.032
It's a story of forbidden love.

13:41.114 --> 13:43.316
It's bound to be a bestseller.

15:39.942 --> 15:42.305
<i>There was no place</i>
<i>I could hide.</i>

15:48.190 --> 15:50.052

15:50.152 --> 15:54.015

<i>[Marcus]: It was Tamara Quinn.</i>

16:23.622 --> 16:25.885
She stole the note.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.967
Yeah, she was angry
that you didn't show up

16:28.067 --> 16:30.169
and the garden party
she threw.

16:30.269 --> 16:31.410
She felt you had
humiliated her,

16:31.510 --> 16:33.752
and humiliated Jenny.

16:35.153 --> 16:36.334
And she got pissed off,

16:36.434 --> 16:37.856
went to your house,

16:37.956 --> 16:39.617
and she claims that she found
what you'd written about Nola,

16:39.717 --> 16:40.578
and she stole it.

16:40.678 --> 16:41.619
What?

16:41.719 --> 16:43.180
She was gonna
use it against you.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.221
But before she could,

16:44.321 --> 16:46.584
it disappeared.

16:46.684 --> 16:48.225
That explains
her behavior

17:03.019 --> 17:03.839
Oh, I don't know.

17:03.939 --> 17:04.880
I'll probably just
use the time

17:04.980 --> 17:06.882
to work on my novel.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.044
It seems like such a...
such a waste

17:09.144 --> 17:11.847
to go to, you know,
a beautiful place alone.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.568
Yeah, well,

17:13.668 --> 17:16.731

17:22.997 --> 17:24.458

your account, Mr. Quebert.

17:24.558 --> 17:25.699
Yes.

17:25.799 --> 17:26.840
And I would like you
to pay what you owe us

17:26.920 --> 17:28.542
by the end of the week.

17:28.642 --> 17:30.984
We will not be extending
any more credit.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.506
Oh, I understand,
Mrs. Quinn,

17:32.606 --> 17:35.508
and I want to apologize
profusely for missing your--

17:35.608 --> 17:37.710
I'm not interested
in your excuses.

17:37.810 --> 17:40.073
Oh, and I received your lovely,

17:40.173 --> 17:42.555
and I hope
very expensive flowers,

17:42.655 --> 17:44.737

into the garbage.

No, yes, I have that.

18:24.573 --> 18:25.714

18:40.348 --> 18:42.350
Yes.

18:44.592 --> 18:46.333
Yeah, no, I can

I'm sorry, I...

19:05.771 --> 19:07.313
I was talking

19:07.413 --> 19:09.414
about this house.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.517
I have to be
honest with you.

19:17.702 --> 19:19.043
I...

19:19.143 --> 19:21.365
I can't afford this house.

19:21.465 --> 19:23.367
I wish I could stay.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.469
So you're just gonna leave?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.692
No...

19:28.792 --> 19:30.173
No.

19:30.273 --> 19:32.275

19:39.682 --> 19:41.224

19:44.086 --> 19:45.988

And we can talk on the phone.

19:49.851 --> 19:50.712
No...

19:50.812 --> 19:51.953
And then when you're 18,
you can...

19:52.053 --> 19:54.155
you can come
to New York, and--

Yes, you can.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.371
How?

20:11.471 --> 20:12.813
We'll find us a way.
We'll find...

20:12.913 --> 20:14.254
It doesn't matter!
We'll make it work.

20:14.354 --> 20:16.356
We always
make it work!

20:17.076 --> 20:18.338
Don't you love me?

20:18.438 --> 20:19.939
That... that...
that's not the point.

20:20.039 --> 20:22.041
Do you love me?

20:29.207 --> 20:31.430
Yes.

20:34.813 --> 20:37.575
You can't leave me.

20:59.755 --> 21:01.757
[sighs]

21:10.205 --> 21:12.207
[starting engine]

21:14.929 --> 21:17.352
<i>[Harry]: Taking her</i>
<i>to the Adirondacks</i>

21:17.452 --> 21:19.354
<i>was a mistake.</i>

21:19.454 --> 21:21.455
<i>I should never have said yes.</i>

21:23.537 --> 21:26.480
<i>She thought that</i>
<i>by being there,</i>

21:26.580 --> 21:27.721
<i>it would free us</i>

21:27.821 --> 21:30.644
<i>to be something</i>
<i>that we couldn't be,</i>

21:30.744 --> 21:33.927
<i>but nothing happened</i>
<i>between us.</i>

21:34.027 --> 21:35.088
<i>I tried to get another room,</i>

21:35.188 --> 21:37.730
<i>but there wasn't one available.</i>

21:37.830 --> 21:40.893
<i>I slept outside on the balcony</i>
<i>on a chair.</i>

21:40.993 --> 21:43.676
<i>It was the longest night</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

21:45.317 --> 21:47.099
<i>I can't make you believe me.</i>

21:47.199 --> 21:49.141
<i>I can't make</i>
<i>anyone believe me,</i>

21:49.241 --> 21:51.103
<i>but it's the truth.</i>

21:51.203 --> 21:52.023
You like to swim, right?

21:52.123 --> 21:52.984
Yes.

21:53.084 --> 21:54.706
Okay, good.
[giggles]

21:54.806 --> 21:55.827
[knock on door]

21:55.927 --> 21:57.749
Nola?

21:57.849 --> 22:00.251
Nola, can I come in?
[knocking]

22:31.640 --> 22:36.704
[dialing phone]

23:06.472 --> 23:07.212
Harry?

23:07.312 --> 23:08.934
Mm-hm.

23:09.034 --> 23:11.036
Look.

23:19.484 --> 23:20.945
What am I looking at?

23:21.045 --> 23:23.047
Them.

23:24.088 --> 23:28.051
No one here is
looking at us.

23:42.064 --> 23:43.406
<i>[Harry]: She wanted so badly</i>

23:43.506 --> 23:46.288
<i>for this to be a time</i>
<i>she'd always remember,</i>

23:46.388 --> 23:50.012
<i>to believe we could have</i>
<i>a future together.</i>

23:50.112 --> 23:51.493
One, two, three...

23:51.593 --> 23:53.595
[shutter clicking]

23:54.996 --> 23:56.377
Oh, that was
a really good one...

23:56.477 --> 23:58.940
<i>[Harry]: I tried</i>
<i>to keep up the pretense,</i>

23:59.040 --> 24:01.462
<i>knowing that we would be</i>
<i>returning to real life</i>

24:01.562 --> 24:03.644
<i>soon enough.</i>

24:10.290 --> 24:12.372
[screaming] Nola!

24:13.533 --> 24:16.055
[rain pattering]

25:02.218 --> 25:06.181
Tell me you'll
be here tomorrow.

25:07.903 --> 25:08.684
Nola...

25:08.784 --> 25:11.106
You can't leave, Harry.

25:14.389 --> 25:15.450
I'll bring you
warm bread.

25:15.550 --> 25:17.211
I'll make you
fresh coffee.

25:17.311 --> 25:18.973
I'll type up
your manuscript.

25:19.073 --> 25:21.075
I'll take care
of everything, just...

25:23.357 --> 25:27.361
just tell me
you'll be here.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.128
I'll be here.

25:38.131 --> 25:40.313
Swear on it.

25:40.413 --> 25:44.056
In the name of our love,
swear that you'll be here.

25:45.497 --> 25:48.060
Please.

26:03.153 --> 26:05.556
I swear.

26:31.580 --> 26:33.581
[starting engine]

26:37.145 --> 26:41.128
And so, you just... left?

26:41.228 --> 26:44.171
What else
was I gonna do?

26:44.271 --> 26:45.252
I was just...

26:45.352 --> 26:47.014
terrified
what Nola would do

26:47.114 --> 26:50.057
when she found out
I'd gone.

26:50.157 --> 26:51.258
But to stay
and to pretend

26:51.358 --> 26:54.461
that we could have some
sort of life together...

26:54.561 --> 26:58.184
would be worse.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.625
She would
have realized

26:59.725 --> 27:01.747
I would have
abandoned her,

27:01.847 --> 27:03.028
and I was afraid

27:03.128 --> 27:05.711
she would
hurt herself again.

27:05.811 --> 27:07.272
But you didn't
go back to New York.

27:07.372 --> 27:09.374
No.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.477
No...

27:12.577 --> 27:13.998
[car honking]

27:14.098 --> 27:16.641
<i>[Harry]: I was</i>
<i>on my way to New York,</i>

27:16.741 --> 27:19.323

27:19.423 --> 27:20.925
[honking]

27:21.025 --> 27:23.447
<i>Luther literally chased me down</i>

27:23.547 --> 27:24.808

27:30.233 --> 27:32.816
[brakes screeching]

27:32.916 --> 27:34.377
<i>It was so aggressive.</i>

27:34.477 --> 27:36.179
<i>I was scared to death</i>
<i>what was going to happen...</i>

27:36.279 --> 27:38.281
What are you doing?

27:40.122 --> 27:41.183
Please...

27:41.283 --> 27:43.506
<i>And he calmly told me that...</i>

27:43.606 --> 27:47.709
<i>Stern had been looking for me</i>

27:47.809 --> 27:49.191
<i>for a few days,</i>

27:49.291 --> 27:51.813
<i>and to follow him home.</i>

28:08.789 --> 28:10.790
[Luther]:
Mr. Quebert.

28:11.831 --> 28:13.253
[Stern]:
Mr. Quebert!

28:13.353 --> 28:14.374
Mr. Stern.

28:14.474 --> 28:15.615
I was starting to think
I'd never find you.

28:15.715 --> 28:16.496
I've, um...

28:16.596 --> 28:18.137
Have a seat.

28:18.237 --> 28:20.339
Oh, thank you.
I've been out of town.

28:20.439 --> 28:22.221
What can I do for you?

28:22.321 --> 28:24.323
I know everything.

28:25.724 --> 28:27.726
Everything.

28:29.287 --> 28:32.130
You thought
you could just run off?

28:35.413 --> 28:38.036
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:38.136 --> 28:40.878
The house at Goose Cove,
of course.

28:40.978 --> 28:43.280
I got a call from the agency.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.441
Why didn't you tell me

28:44.541 --> 28:46.804
that you were going to
have to leave the house?

28:46.904 --> 28:49.046
I'm afraid
I've exhausted my funds...

28:49.146 --> 28:51.047
and, um...

28:51.147 --> 28:52.849
I have to...

28:52.949 --> 28:54.250
alter my plans.

28:54.350 --> 28:56.572
Well...

28:56.672 --> 28:59.215
there's no need to leave
on that account.

28:59.315 --> 29:02.178
I don't need
the income from renting,

29:02.278 --> 29:04.500
and I'd very much
like to support

29:04.600 --> 29:06.622
your artistic endeavor,

29:06.722 --> 29:08.023
so why don't you
stay at the house

29:08.123 --> 29:09.144
to finish your novel?

29:09.244 --> 29:11.266
What do you think?

29:11.366 --> 29:12.267
I don't understand.

29:12.367 --> 29:14.269
It's...

29:14.369 --> 29:16.751
We don't know each other well.

29:16.851 --> 29:18.753
Why such generosity?

29:18.853 --> 29:22.356
The pride of contributing

29:22.456 --> 29:25.119
to the creation
of a great novel.

29:25.219 --> 29:27.801
Every artist needs a benefactor,

29:27.901 --> 29:30.043
and I'd like to be yours.

29:30.143 --> 29:33.246
So the next thing
that was on my mind was...

29:33.346 --> 29:35.889
getting back
to the house in time.

29:35.989 --> 29:38.411
I was panicked that
Nola would've come back,

29:38.511 --> 29:39.452
found the door locked,

29:39.552 --> 29:40.733
the house buttoned up,

29:40.833 --> 29:43.275
and she would've realized
that I had abandoned her.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.351
<i>[Marcus]: You made it</i>
<i>back in time?</i>

30:00.451 --> 30:01.872
<i>[Harry]:</i>
<i>I made it back in time.</i>

30:01.972 --> 30:03.234
<i>But she must</i>
<i>have wondered</i>

30:03.334 --> 30:04.515
where you got the money
for the rent--

30:04.615 --> 30:06.076
Oh, yeah, she did.

30:06.176 --> 30:09.399
I just told her
that it was... a bank loan,

30:09.499 --> 30:12.282
made up some bullshit
about that and, uh...

30:12.382 --> 30:15.084
she believed me.

30:15.184 --> 30:17.326
And we never
discussed it again.

30:17.426 --> 30:19.729
Hmm.

30:19.829 --> 30:21.991
And the next month
was just absolute bliss.

30:25.874 --> 30:27.576
[typing]

30:27.676 --> 30:29.257
<i>[Harry]: I'd never, ever,</i>
<i>in my entire life</i>

30:29.357 --> 30:31.179
<i>been so inspired.</i>

30:31.279 --> 30:33.721
<i>It was like...</i>

30:35.083 --> 30:39.447
<i>the writing</i>

[âªâªâªâªâª]

31:36.379 --> 31:38.681
Your writing
is beautiful.

31:38.781 --> 31:40.963
[giggles]

31:41.063 --> 31:44.066
It goes straight
to your heart.

31:50.151 --> 31:52.173
See you tomorrow,
right?

31:52.273 --> 31:52.974
Yes.

31:53.074 --> 31:55.076
Okay?

31:56.597 --> 31:57.498
[giggles]

31:57.598 --> 32:00.081
Thank you.

32:04.605 --> 32:07.948
<i>[Harry]: She was</i>

<i>type them up,</i>

<i>[Harry]: Always.</i>

32:23.102 --> 32:25.103
<i>She was brilliant.</i>

32:25.784 --> 32:28.206
I could never have
written it without her.

32:28.306 --> 32:30.048
Hmm.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.770
She was my muse.

32:31.870 --> 32:35.093
So that's how Harry Quebert
wrote his masterpiece

32:35.193 --> 32:37.195
in a mere few weeks.

32:38.115 --> 32:40.257
You know, when she was gone,

32:40.357 --> 32:43.080
I could never write
like that again.

32:44.481 --> 32:45.122
[guard]:
Five minutes, Quebert.

32:45.202 --> 32:47.064
Mm-hm.

32:47.164 --> 32:48.225
And you felt safe?

32:48.325 --> 32:49.506
No one bothered you?

32:49.606 --> 32:50.667
No, I never
felt safe.

32:50.767 --> 32:53.750
I always felt like
somebody was watching me.

32:53.850 --> 32:56.252
watching us.

33:01.577 --> 33:03.078
Want me to turn it off?

33:03.178 --> 33:05.340
This is for
your ears only.

33:09.704 --> 33:11.406
I made a horrible
discovery

33:11.506 --> 33:13.508
about Nola's mother.

33:14.629 --> 33:16.971
A few days
after the Adirondacks,

33:17.071 --> 33:20.054
she came to my house...

33:20.154 --> 33:22.156
[door opens]

33:26.880 --> 33:28.882
[sighs]

33:32.725 --> 33:34.867
I lied to you

33:34.967 --> 33:36.869
when I told you
that I told my parents

33:36.969 --> 33:39.432
that I was staying
at Nancy's house.

33:39.532 --> 33:40.953
I didn't tell them anything.

33:41.053 --> 33:43.055
I just ran away.

33:44.176 --> 33:47.739
My mother told me
I had to be punished.

33:55.747 --> 33:57.048
[âªâªâªâªâª]

33:57.148 --> 34:00.091
So her mother
found out about it,

34:00.191 --> 34:01.692
and beat her with a ruler.

34:01.792 --> 34:02.893
I could see the bruises.

34:02.993 --> 34:04.775
That's criminal.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.056
She also would get
a bowl of water,

34:06.156 --> 34:07.337
fill it with ice,

34:07.437 --> 34:09.820
grab the back of her head,
submerge her,

34:09.920 --> 34:12.322
and tell her that she was
gonna deliver her.

34:13.643 --> 34:15.064
She'd deliver her?

34:15.164 --> 34:17.467
Deliver her from evil.

34:17.567 --> 34:18.988
[Nola's mother]: Go on...

34:19.088 --> 34:20.990
say the words.

34:21.090 --> 34:22.511

34:22.611 --> 34:24.673
have..."

34:38.185 --> 34:40.187
[spluttering and gasping]

34:41.829 --> 34:43.771
I have...

34:43.871 --> 34:46.133
forsaken the Lord.

34:46.233 --> 34:48.095
I have provoked the Holy One.

34:48.195 --> 34:50.016
I have sinned,
and I have done evil."

34:50.116 --> 34:51.898
Are you going to be
a good girl?

34:51.998 --> 34:54.340
Yes. I promise, Mother.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.702
If only your promises

34:55.802 --> 34:56.903
were enough
to defeat the devil.

34:57.003 --> 34:57.904
No!

34:58.004 --> 35:00.005
[screaming] No, please!

35:01.006 --> 35:01.807
[guard]: Time's up, Quebert.
Let's go.

35:01.887 --> 35:02.868
I don't understand

35:02.968 --> 35:04.790
why don't you want anyone
to know this.

35:04.890 --> 35:05.711
Because I learned
something

35:05.811 --> 35:07.192
way more frightening.

35:07.292 --> 35:08.713
I made another horrible
discovery about her mother.

35:08.813 --> 35:09.835
What discovery?

35:09.935 --> 35:11.396
[guard]: I said time's up.
Let's go.

35:11.496 --> 35:14.258
I made a horrible discovery
about her mother.

35:20.064 --> 35:21.405
The thing is,

35:21.505 --> 35:22.967
I didn't even know Nola had
gone to the Adirondacks

35:23.067 --> 35:24.248
at the time.

35:24.348 --> 35:25.769
She never said
a word about it?

35:25.869 --> 35:27.010
Nothing.

35:27.110 --> 35:28.372
I just showed up at her house
like I always did,

35:28.472 --> 35:29.533
so we could go
to the beach together.

35:29.633 --> 35:31.735
Mm-hm.

35:31.835 --> 35:33.836
[ringing doorbell]

35:39.722 --> 35:42.404
Nola?

35:50.051 --> 35:52.133
Nola, are you in there?

35:59.780 --> 36:03.944
[ringing doorbell]

36:06.987 --> 36:10.610
Nola isn't feeling
too well, Nancy.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.692
But I'll be sure
to tell her you dropped by.

36:12.792 --> 36:14.794
[door closes]

36:16.796 --> 36:19.578
All week, it was the same.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.780
"Nola isn't feeling well.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.581
I'll tell her you stopped by."

36:22.681 --> 36:24.223
Then on that following Monday,

36:24.323 --> 36:25.584
voilÃ ,

36:25.684 --> 36:27.866
Nola magically
reappeared.

36:27.966 --> 36:29.588
Why won't you tell me
where you were?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.750
Why all the secrecy?

36:31.850 --> 36:35.073
You wouldn't
understand.

36:35.173 --> 36:36.674
And what's with
the sweatshirt?

36:36.774 --> 36:38.776
It's, like, 85 out.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.739
I just felt like
wearing it.

36:44.781 --> 36:47.164
Because you can tell me.

36:47.264 --> 36:51.948
I mean, someone's beating
you again, aren't they?

36:54.070 --> 36:56.252
Yes, for, um...

36:56.352 --> 36:59.735
disappearing for a week.

36:59.835 --> 37:02.258
But it was worth it.

37:02.358 --> 37:05.621
I'd do it again
in a heartbeat.

37:05.721 --> 37:06.662
<i>[Nancy]:</i>
<i>That's when she told me</i>

37:06.762 --> 37:09.064
about her being in love
with an older man.

37:09.164 --> 37:10.745
She didn't name names,

37:10.845 --> 37:12.227
but I'm sure
it was Stern.

37:12.327 --> 37:13.348
Did you ever
see them together?

37:13.448 --> 37:14.669
Nola and Stern?

37:14.769 --> 37:16.671
No. Like I told you,

37:16.771 --> 37:19.754
he'd just send that
deformed chauffeur of his.

37:19.854 --> 37:21.355
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>was so sordid...</i>

37:21.455 --> 37:24.378
<i>secretive.</i>

37:34.107 --> 37:36.108
Nola?

37:38.831 --> 37:40.172
[engine starts]

37:40.272 --> 37:42.274
Nola, you...

37:51.643 --> 37:54.025
<i>[Marcus]: So you never</i>
<i>confronted her about it?</i>

37:54.125 --> 37:56.547
I did... once.

37:56.647 --> 37:57.909
I asked her why,

37:58.009 --> 37:59.830
when she could've been
with any boy she wanted,

37:59.930 --> 38:01.592
she chose to be
with some old guy.

38:01.692 --> 38:02.913
What'd she say?

38:03.013 --> 38:04.995
Just two words...

38:05.095 --> 38:07.557
"For love."

38:07.657 --> 38:09.839
After she disappeared,

38:09.939 --> 38:12.122
I told Chief Pratt everything.

38:12.222 --> 38:13.243
He promised he'd investigate.

38:13.343 --> 38:14.123
Uh-huh.

38:14.223 --> 38:16.886
Get to the bottom of it.

38:16.986 --> 38:21.510
If I'd spoken up sooner,
she'd be alive today.

38:24.513 --> 38:25.694
<i>[Marcus]: Sergeant, it's me.</i>

38:25.794 --> 38:27.255
Wrong number.

38:27.355 --> 38:28.256
Yeah, we need to go back

38:28.356 --> 38:29.157
and re-interview
Kellergan, Sergeant.

38:29.237 --> 38:30.258
<i>Oh, we do, do we?</i>

38:30.358 --> 38:31.900
And what makes us think
it's so important

38:32.000 --> 38:33.701
that we have to call
after hours?

38:33.801 --> 38:35.183
New evidence
to confront him with, okay?

38:35.283 --> 38:37.185
Nola's relationships,
her beatings.

38:37.285 --> 38:38.266
I'll tell you what.

38:38.366 --> 38:39.467
You ask the minister

38:39.567 --> 38:40.988
if his wife beat the crap
out of his daughter

38:41.088 --> 38:42.429
because she was a slut, okay?

38:42.529 --> 38:43.751
<i>And I'll follow</i>
<i>my lead.</i>

38:43.851 --> 38:45.852
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what lead?

38:46.453 --> 38:48.074
<i>Come on, Perry, you know</i>
<i>I'm gonna stick around</i>

38:48.174 --> 38:49.436
<i>whether you include me or not.</i>

38:49.536 --> 38:50.837
[sighs]

38:50.937 --> 38:52.879
Meet me at Clark's,
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

38:52.979 --> 38:54.240
No, why Clark's?
Just tell me now.

38:54.340 --> 38:56.082
Because I said so.

38:56.182 --> 38:57.924
God!

38:58.024 --> 39:00.266
Asshole.

39:04.189 --> 39:06.191
What's up?

39:07.312 --> 39:09.654
Water, please.
Thank you.

39:09.754 --> 39:11.016
Oh, you know what?

39:11.116 --> 39:12.857
Clark's does have
fantastic water.

39:12.957 --> 39:14.419
No wonder you wanted
to meet here.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.180
You should, uh, you
should try the ice.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.262
Unbelievable.

39:18.362 --> 39:21.185
In August 1975,

39:21.285 --> 39:23.027
a complaint was filed
against Luther Caleb

39:23.127 --> 39:24.668
by Jenny Quinn,

39:24.768 --> 39:26.229
now Jenny Dawn,
for assault.

39:26.329 --> 39:27.270
What?

39:27.370 --> 39:28.632
Yeah. It turns out

39:28.732 --> 39:30.193
he was already
being monitored by police

39:30.293 --> 39:32.755
for inappropriate
behavior towards women

39:32.855 --> 39:35.758
between the years
of 1970 and 1975.

39:35.858 --> 39:37.760
Holy shit.

39:37.860 --> 39:41.143
And that's why
we're meeting at Clark's.

39:44.306 --> 39:46.648
Poor Luther.

39:46.748 --> 39:48.370
He was sweet,

39:48.470 --> 39:50.772
in spite of
the way he looked.

39:50.872 --> 39:53.454
I could never bring myself
to charge him.

39:53.554 --> 39:55.376
And yet, you filed
a complaint

39:55.476 --> 39:56.817
against him.

39:56.917 --> 39:59.820
Yeah. Travis insisted.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.983
He hung around Sommerdale
a lot that summer,

40:03.083 --> 40:04.825
and...

40:04.925 --> 40:07.327
sometimes he acted a little
aggressively towards me.

40:08.848 --> 40:10.030
Was he violent?

40:10.130 --> 40:12.392
No, just...

40:12.492 --> 40:14.434
a little too insistent.

40:14.534 --> 40:15.955
Right.

40:16.055 --> 40:17.076
He...

40:17.176 --> 40:18.277
he wanted me to...

40:18.377 --> 40:19.959
This is going
to sound ridiculous.

40:20.059 --> 40:23.362
He... he wanted me
to sit for him.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.304
So he could
paint me.

40:29.507 --> 40:30.929
Don't look so shocked.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.090
I was a goddamn prom queen.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.411
No, yeah.
-Yeah?

40:33.511 --> 40:35.173
-Yeah.
-Oh.

40:35.273 --> 40:36.734
He had trouble

40:36.834 --> 40:38.496
taking no for an answer.

40:38.596 --> 40:40.377
[sighs sadly]

40:40.477 --> 40:41.779
Well, what...

40:41.879 --> 40:43.700
what, uh...
what happened to him?

40:43.800 --> 40:44.741
One day,

40:44.841 --> 40:47.784
he just disappeared.

40:47.884 --> 40:51.908
Apparently he was killed
in a car accident or something.

40:52.008 --> 40:53.229
They found
Luther Caleb's car

40:53.329 --> 40:55.832
at the bottom of a cliff
near Bradford.

40:55.932 --> 40:58.514
That was four weeks
after Nola's disappearance.

40:58.614 --> 40:59.835
They also found out

40:59.935 --> 41:00.916
he attended
a fine arts college

41:01.016 --> 41:02.037
in Portland,

41:02.137 --> 41:03.158
so it's more than likely

41:03.258 --> 41:06.021
the initials
on Nola's painting are his.

41:10.024 --> 41:11.686
[clearing throat]

41:11.786 --> 41:14.048
[knocking]

41:14.148 --> 41:16.691
Okay, why wasn't this guy
a suspect back in '75?

41:16.791 --> 41:18.092
There was no evidence
in the original case file

41:18.192 --> 41:20.134
that pointed to him.

41:20.234 --> 41:21.215
Okay, well,
we need to go back

41:21.315 --> 41:22.456
and talk to Stern.

41:22.556 --> 41:23.857
And say what?

41:23.957 --> 41:24.938
We have reason to suspect

41:25.038 --> 41:26.940
your chauffeur was
guilty of painting?

41:27.040 --> 41:28.742
No, we need concrete
evidence of foul play,

41:28.842 --> 41:30.503
legally obtained.

41:30.603 --> 41:31.905
And stop with all this
"we" shit, man.

41:32.005 --> 41:32.906
There's no "we."

41:33.006 --> 41:33.886
Oh, does that mean
you're not taking me

41:33.966 --> 41:34.987
to the policemen's ball?

41:35.087 --> 41:37.089
[knocking insistently]

41:38.130 --> 41:40.132
[motorcycle approaching]

41:40.973 --> 41:42.875
All right, keep
your mouth shut.

41:42.975 --> 41:44.917
I ask the
questions, okay?

41:45.017 --> 41:46.718
I'm the cop, you're the writer.

41:46.818 --> 41:48.820
And I use that term
very loosely.

42:06.036 --> 42:07.577
Hello, Sergeant.

42:07.677 --> 42:10.060
Sir.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.161
You workin'
with the police now?

42:12.882 --> 42:14.544
Uh, he is not.

42:14.644 --> 42:15.825
Furthermore, he understands

42:15.925 --> 42:18.027
he's not allowed
to speak to you directly,

42:18.127 --> 42:20.149
and that I'll be the one
asking all the questions.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.830
Right?

42:21.930 --> 42:23.932
-Mm-hm.
-Yeah.

42:24.853 --> 42:26.114
When will
my daughter's remains

42:26.214 --> 42:28.076
be returned to me,
Sergeant?

42:28.176 --> 42:31.319
I would like to give her
a proper burial.

42:31.419 --> 42:33.441
Uh...

42:33.541 --> 42:36.924
Soon, sir.

42:37.024 --> 42:38.285
I know
it's difficult.

42:38.385 --> 42:40.608
My apologies.

42:40.708 --> 42:41.769
Mr. Kellergan,

42:41.869 --> 42:43.010
there are
a few gray areas

42:43.110 --> 42:44.171
in our case file

42:44.271 --> 42:45.172
that we're
trying to fill in.

42:45.272 --> 42:46.213
I was wondering

42:46.313 --> 42:48.295
if you knew
a certain Elijah Stern?

42:48.395 --> 42:50.016
Not personally.

42:50.116 --> 42:53.139
I met him at a few
Sommerdale functions, I believe.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.220
And his chauffeur?

42:54.320 --> 42:56.062
Luther Caleb?

42:56.162 --> 42:57.343
I don't recall

42:57.443 --> 42:58.584
a Luther Caleb.

42:58.684 --> 43:00.025
Why?

43:00.125 --> 43:01.507
Um...

43:01.607 --> 43:03.228
We believe Nola
may have been...

43:03.328 --> 43:06.131
linked to these two people.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.114
Linked?

43:09.214 --> 43:10.075
We think--

43:10.175 --> 43:11.796
[snapping fingers,
tapping table]

43:11.896 --> 43:13.998
There's no, uh, way

43:14.098 --> 43:16.801
to say this delicately,
Reverend, but, um...

43:16.901 --> 43:17.842
we have evidence that suggests

43:17.942 --> 43:18.943
your daughter
was in a relationship

43:19.023 --> 43:21.145
with Mr. Stern.

43:30.033 --> 43:32.976
My daughter...

43:33.076 --> 43:35.498
was the victim...

43:35.598 --> 43:39.462
of that bastard pedophile,
Harry Quebert,

43:39.562 --> 43:41.583
who deserves to die
on death row

43:41.683 --> 43:43.105
for what he did!

43:43.205 --> 43:45.207
This conversation is over!

43:48.730 --> 43:50.311
[Marcus]:
Your wife beat her,

43:50.411 --> 43:51.432
didn't she,
Reverend?

43:51.532 --> 43:53.074
Oh, you don't know
what you're talkin' about!

43:53.174 --> 43:54.155
Well, why didn't you
tell anyone

43:54.255 --> 43:55.957
when Nola first
ran away in late July?

43:56.057 --> 43:56.697
You didn't
call the police?

43:56.777 --> 43:57.678
What, you just

43:57.778 --> 43:58.879
you wait around
for a whole week?

43:58.979 --> 44:00.881
Because I knew she'd come back,
and she did.

44:00.981 --> 44:02.523
No, you felt guilty
about the beatings

44:02.623 --> 44:04.124
that she was getting
from her mother,

44:04.224 --> 44:05.565
the ones that you did
nothing to stop,

44:05.665 --> 44:06.767
and then she--

44:06.867 --> 44:09.569
[roaring] Go back to the hell
you came from!

44:09.669 --> 44:11.931
Reverend! Reverend!

44:12.031 --> 44:14.033
[gasping]

44:15.114 --> 44:17.096
Don't kill him, Reverend.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.518
Let me do it.

44:28.406 --> 44:30.028
I'm a fucking idiot
for letting you tag along.

44:30.128 --> 44:30.909
I'm just--

44:31.009 --> 44:32.310
Shut up!

44:32.410 --> 44:34.932
Don't say another word.

44:38.295 --> 44:42.760
Oh, God. Forgive me.

44:42.860 --> 44:45.182
Forgive me.

44:47.344 --> 44:49.706
[âªâªâªâªâª]
