03:52.510 --> 03:56.270
Dummy... dummy... dummy...

03:57.550 --> 04:00.190
C'mon, it's over.

04:00.350 --> 04:04.350
Time to kick out the jams.

04:04.430 --> 04:07.390
Summer time fun.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.109
Dummy... dummy... dummy... dummy.

04:11.110 --> 04:15.390
Quit it with the ball
peen hammer imitation.

04:15.910 --> 04:17.189
Here's Bonnie.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.350
- Where?
- There.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.709
Hi, Bonnie!

04:30.710 --> 04:34.469
Bobby, I've been looking for you.
You didn't sign my yearbook.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.110
Same here.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.110
Here you go.

04:56.350 --> 05:00.189
"To the girl who's meant the most
to me all through high school.

05:00.190 --> 05:01.750
Love, Bobby."

05:01.990 --> 05:04.310
That's really sweet, Bobby.

05:10.750 --> 05:14.470
I gotta go. I'll see you, okay?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.030
What did she write?

05:41.190 --> 05:45.749
"To the funniest guy in third
period study hall. Bonnie."

05:45.750 --> 05:48.310
Very romantic.

05:52.230 --> 05:57.229
Tonight's the night, fellas!
The sacrifice of the virgins.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.749
Not so loud!

05:59.750 --> 06:02.950
Time to go to the drug
store and get you fitted.

06:14.070 --> 06:15.870
Eight o'clock.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.830
Bravo, Bravo, let's go!
We're running late.

06:40.110 --> 06:43.230
Not too much. She'll slide off.

06:43.630 --> 06:46.589
C'mon. We're going to a whorehouse.

06:46.590 --> 06:49.150
We're not getting married here.

06:49.550 --> 06:51.670
What the hell you got in there?

06:52.630 --> 06:56.109
These are the old
"Johnny Walker Black."

06:56.110 --> 07:01.230
I stole it from my dad. The stuff's
so good he never drinks it.

07:01.510 --> 07:04.310
Go ahead. It'll cool your nerves.

07:10.422 --> 07:13.507
You know what this stuff.

07:13.508 --> 07:16.669
Come on. Let's go. I wanna brush
my hair. Yeah. Later. Later.

07:23.590 --> 07:27.070
This is it! This is it!

07:34.870 --> 07:36.950
I don't know about this, guys.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.190
My stomach doesn't feel
so good, you know.

07:39.470 --> 07:42.990
- How about another night?
- I think you should go.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.230
Oh, Billy.

07:55.710 --> 08:00.789
For these two we have
the graduation present.

08:00.790 --> 08:03.389
So? Which one is
your brother, Jack?

08:03.390 --> 08:06.029
Right here, over here. That's me!

08:06.030 --> 08:07.830
A real eager beaver.

08:09.190 --> 08:12.870
For you we have Louisa.

08:34.070 --> 08:36.629
First time up at the
plate, right, Jack?

08:36.630 --> 08:41.070
Yes, but I'm out to win
rookie of the year.

08:46.510 --> 08:49.069
And now for you,

08:49.070 --> 08:52.990
we have something
very very special.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.190
Anna-Maria.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.309
Give me your hand, Jack.

09:34.310 --> 09:37.270
Okey dokey.

09:43.070 --> 09:45.870
- Up against the wall.
- All right.

09:46.990 --> 09:49.190
There you go.

09:51.150 --> 09:53.110
What's going on?

09:53.710 --> 09:55.749
You'll see.

09:55.750 --> 09:59.870
Oh, boy, this is gonna
be really wild.

10:01.670 --> 10:05.630
- Now give me your other hand.
- All right.

10:07.870 --> 10:10.250
Are you sure about this?

10:10.251 --> 10:12.749
Maybe this is a little
advanced for me.

10:12.750 --> 10:16.111
Don't worry. It'll Be wonderful.

10:57.055 --> 10:58.967
You like it?

11:07.802 --> 11:09.331
Are you ready, Jack?

11:09.332 --> 11:11.385
Oh yes, I'm ready!

11:13.199 --> 11:15.356
Oh my god!

11:15.357 --> 11:16.658
So am I.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.996
Come over here my little bambino.

11:22.001 --> 11:23.480
Climb it up.

11:28.845 --> 11:29.894
How does it feel?

11:31.029 --> 11:34.409
Wonderful. But wouldn't it
be better if I was untied?

11:36.405 --> 11:39.375
But your brother wanted you
to have the full treatment.

12:01.751 --> 12:05.841
- Is it good?
- Oh. Yes.

12:07.695 --> 12:09.306
Do you like surprises?

12:09.760 --> 12:11.493
Oh yes.

12:13.049 --> 12:14.394
Good.

12:19.357 --> 12:23.286
This is wild.

13:02.163 --> 13:05.146
Bambino wake up!

13:05.147 --> 13:10.204
Wake up! Oooh!

13:26.516 --> 13:29.095
Billy, what kind of weirdo did
you set me up with in there?

13:29.219 --> 13:30.416
I almost got killed!

13:30.417 --> 13:31.659
- Hey, I didn't know, alright?
- Yeah, yeah...

13:31.660 --> 13:34.974
well, next time do a
little legwork, will you?

13:34.975 --> 13:36.978
This is ridiculous.
I don't believe it.

13:37.263 --> 13:38.532
You can't even get
laid in a whorehouse.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.551
Did you have a good time?

13:45.112 --> 13:48.832
Maria, Fruit. Salad. Lunch.

13:49.472 --> 13:51.647
Rose bushes. Trim.

13:52.534 --> 13:56.679
- Fruit. Salad. Lunch.
- Right.

13:58.697 --> 14:05.178
- Aah, Manuel.
- Aaah, Rose bushes trim.

14:06.415 --> 14:07.576
- Hi honey!
- Hi mom!

14:08.064 --> 14:10.601
- where is dad mom?
- He is in the studies.

14:10.602 --> 14:11.591
I am late for lunch.

14:22.158 --> 14:23.446
Sit down, Bobby.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.681
It's been quite a morning.
Mr. Simpson called from your school.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.150
It seems that we've got a problem.

14:36.190 --> 14:38.830
You flunked your French final

14:40.550 --> 14:43.949
I've been on the phone to Yale...
They'll hold your place,

14:43.950 --> 14:47.390
on one condition, that
you take a makeup exam.

14:47.550 --> 14:52.230
The only catch is, you have to
do better than an eighty-fives.

14:54.190 --> 14:56.949
I've already contacted
a language agency.

14:56.950 --> 14:58.229
And as of tomorrow morning,

14:58.230 --> 15:00.709
the best freelance French
teacher... in the city...

15:00.710 --> 15:01.989
is going to be here.
She is gonna live here.

15:01.990 --> 15:04.230
You will work... with her every day,

15:04.510 --> 15:08.670
and I assure you... you are
going to pass that exam.

15:12.310 --> 15:18.550
I don't mind telling you,
this is damn embarrassing.

16:07.710 --> 16:10.869
Hello, Bobby. I'm Terry
Green, your French tutor.

16:10.870 --> 16:14.190
We going to be working
together this summer.

16:20.230 --> 16:24.190
- I suppose we have to start today.
- Tomorrow is soon enough.

16:24.470 --> 16:26.990
It's too soon for me.
How about next week.

16:27.030 --> 16:31.070
- Oh, I am Sorry.
- One day" summer vacation.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.870
Terrific.

16:36.110 --> 16:40.510
In addition, if you succeed
and Bobby passes...

16:40.550 --> 16:45.510
there will be a final bonus
payment of ten thousand dollars.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.670
That's quite a bonus.

16:48.910 --> 16:51.870
I want you as committed
to this as I am.

16:57.510 --> 17:03.109
Now, I'd like this part of our
bargain to be just between us.

17:03.110 --> 17:05.950
I don't want Bobby to know.
Understand?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.589
Yes.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.950
He is under enough pressure
already. God knows he's been...

17:12.470 --> 17:14.589
a great disappointment to me.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.950
His attitude, his grades...

17:18.030 --> 17:21.630
I had to pull quite a few strings
to get him into Yale. And now this.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.869
What is so important about Yale?

17:23.950 --> 17:25.550
Because I went there.

17:25.710 --> 17:30.590
And being a Yalie was just about the
finest memory I ever had in my life.

17:31.670 --> 17:35.188
- I want the same for Bobby.
- What does Bobby want?

17:35.189 --> 17:36.990
He's too young to
know what he wants.

17:37.150 --> 17:41.510
All I know is what I want and
that's for him to pass that exam.

17:43.278 --> 17:50.007
Ok. The word ethua.
To be. Conjugation.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.990
Bobby?

17:56.270 --> 17:57.590
I hate this French crap.

18:02.750 --> 18:06.709
Oui. You've got the picture.
I even hate French fries.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.349
- Pommes frites.
- Yeah right. Pommes frites.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.910
- Excellent pronunciation.
- Dumb luck.

18:14.817 --> 18:20.369
Look, forget it. No way I'm
going to pass this exam.

18:20.370 --> 18:22.390
We might as well just chuck it.

18:22.591 --> 18:26.010
You pass. There isn't a student
made that I can't teach.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.550
A little conceited, aren't you?

18:28.870 --> 18:30.630
I'm very good.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.270
What are you getting out of this?

18:35.150 --> 18:38.670
A little money. A quiet place
to stay for a month or so.

18:39.710 --> 18:43.390
Well how come you're not married?
Or have a boyfriend at least.

18:43.430 --> 18:46.550
I don't think that's any
of your business, Bobby.

18:47.550 --> 18:50.110
Hey, come on, give me a break.

18:50.270 --> 18:53.470
I'm trying to learn about
life and love, here.

18:53.830 --> 18:56.429
Okay. I had a
boyfriend, we broke up,

18:56.430 --> 18:59.110
and I needed a place to stay.
Is that Okay?

18:59.190 --> 19:00.629
Well, how come you broke up?

19:00.630 --> 19:03.870
This is none of your business.
Can we please do work.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.750
I can tell, you're gonna
work me hard this summer.

19:08.430 --> 19:11.430
That's my job, ne'st pas?

19:14.030 --> 19:16.230
Okay, now if this doesn't work
out. There is always Mexico.

19:16.231 --> 19:18.429
You'd get it down there, for sure.

19:18.430 --> 19:21.789
Oh no, I'm not going to Mexico.

19:21.790 --> 19:25.028
You can catch all kinds
of diseases down there.

19:25.029 --> 19:26.909
That's just if you drink
the water, you turkey.

19:26.910 --> 19:31.389
- Yeah, same difference.
- There it is guys. Now be cool,

19:31.390 --> 19:33.950
Remember I got you
covered, all right?

19:39.505 --> 19:41.999
Oh boy. Oh boy.

19:52.790 --> 19:56.670
She won't hurt you. No whips.
She promises.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.830
Hey, Billy, I don't know about this.

20:41.590 --> 20:44.949
Who wants to know. You guys are
about to get your lances waxed.

20:44.950 --> 20:48.509
No big deal. Even when we
speak. Right at this second.

20:48.510 --> 20:51.829
Millions of people are just
banging away like crazy.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.870
These are facts of life.

20:55.110 --> 20:58.550
That's kind of awesome thought.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.470
Yeah, it is. Isn't it?

21:07.390 --> 21:09.870
There she is... athletic?

21:12.150 --> 21:15.674
I am on my break. Let's do it.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.390
We'll be in the bar
across the street.

21:35.750 --> 21:39.310
Save some for me!

21:43.630 --> 21:45.710
I've only got ten minutes.

21:46.270 --> 21:48.070
Ten minutes?

21:49.070 --> 21:52.966
I got a Chrysler 'cause it
has the biggest back seat.

22:36.802 --> 22:37.999
Nice.

22:49.675 --> 22:51.225
- Aw shit!!
- What?

22:52.051 --> 22:55.503
- It's my boyfriend.
- Your Boyfriend!?

22:55.529 --> 22:59.493
Well... actually... we're
engaged to be married.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.738
He hates when I do this.

23:11.221 --> 23:15.338
The last guy he caught me with...
he dragged behind his bike in chains!

23:17.740 --> 23:21.362
Oh don't worry,
it was only over dirt!

23:50.585 --> 23:53.041
Sylvia.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.678
Sylvia. Where is he?

24:03.855 --> 24:06.051
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna
tear out his eyeballs!

24:06.052 --> 24:09.249
I'm gonna rip off his arm and
beat him to death with it.

24:09.250 --> 24:12.646
I want that son of a bitch!

24:29.115 --> 24:30.361
There's the little prick!

24:39.009 --> 24:42.608
Say your prayers, Boy.
You're about to meet Jesus.

24:43.359 --> 24:47.068
That's not him! That's not him!
That's not him!

24:47.121 --> 24:49.621
- It's not me! It's not me! It's not me!
- You sure?

24:50.364 --> 24:54.556
Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't
ball that lamb even for money!

24:56.367 --> 24:57.480
Thank you!

25:21.418 --> 25:23.908
Hay, was it as good as I said?
Did I cover you or what?

25:25.341 --> 25:27.636
Let's go. Come on.

29:17.110 --> 29:20.349
Okay, here you go.
Try these, fifteen minutes.

29:20.350 --> 29:23.270
Starting... now.

29:26.310 --> 29:28.030
Bobby, get to work.

29:28.550 --> 29:29.790
Okay

29:30.270 --> 29:33.190
I'm going to go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

29:33.270 --> 29:36.230
- No thanks.
- Ok, I'll be right back.

30:28.470 --> 30:31.830
Bobby, where are you?

30:35.150 --> 30:37.470
Oh, boy. No work?

30:37.790 --> 30:39.829
I can't leave you
alone for a second.

30:39.830 --> 30:41.709
Here. It looks like
you could use this.

30:41.710 --> 30:43.270
Thanks.

30:54.510 --> 30:56.910
Okay, get to work.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.470
It's too hot.

31:03.190 --> 31:06.790
Bobby, will you just
do the test, please.

31:09.670 --> 31:12.230
It's really way too hot...

31:40.430 --> 31:44.269
- Now that's better.
- I take it this is a study break?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.869
Great idea.
I'm glad you thought of it.

31:46.870 --> 31:50.750
All right then. Teacher
gets to take a break too.

32:08.870 --> 32:11.630
Where did you learn to
speak French so well?

32:11.631 --> 32:13.910
I went to college in France.

32:14.710 --> 32:18.829
I knew it. Nobody can learn to
speak French in California.

32:18.830 --> 32:21.710
Spanish, maybe. French, no way.

32:21.750 --> 32:25.190
- I should've taken Spanish.
- Why didn't you?

32:25.790 --> 32:28.189
My Dad thought it was a good idea.

32:28.190 --> 32:31.390
He wants me to study
international law at Yale.

32:31.430 --> 32:34.229
Oh yeah? You do everything
your father wants you to do?

32:34.230 --> 32:38.310
No. Not always.

32:38.990 --> 32:42.990
If I had my way I'd go to
UCLA and study astronomy.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.429
I'm sorry...

32:45.430 --> 32:48.230
But you know I'm not hired here as a
guidance counselor. And no matter...

32:48.231 --> 32:51.990
what school you go to you'll need
to pass that test, so please.

33:02.830 --> 33:04.630
How old are you?

33:04.710 --> 33:07.430
- Would you stop stalling?
- Forty?

33:07.550 --> 33:11.150
- Forty-five? Twenty-five?
- Twenty nine.

33:11.470 --> 33:13.349
- Have you been married?
- No.

33:13.350 --> 33:14.950
Engaged?

33:15.830 --> 33:18.949
- Yes and no.
- You lived with a guy, right?

33:18.950 --> 33:21.829
- This last guy you just broke up with, huh?
- Bobby,

33:21.830 --> 33:25.910
I wish you were as good at French
as you are at Twenty Questions.

33:26.350 --> 33:28.470
Vingt questions.

33:28.910 --> 33:31.710
Tres bien. Get to work.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.550
You pervert

34:04.390 --> 34:06.550
I promised her a ride home..

34:06.750 --> 34:12.630
Well, how are things going
between you and your tutor?

34:13.389 --> 34:14.789
Okay.

34:14.790 --> 34:18.790
Have you tried to
score with her yet?

34:19.190 --> 34:21.110
Come on, Jack, what
are you kidding?

34:21.350 --> 34:25.550
I know I would've
scored with her by now.

34:25.830 --> 34:32.590
Just you and her...
Alone, by the pool...

34:33.070 --> 34:37.469
Yeah, I would've been there
and beck a few times by now.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.510
Jack, you don't believe
your own bullshit, do you?

35:03.550 --> 35:07.150
And I'm going to hit
the ceiling tonight.

35:20.070 --> 35:23.149
- It's only an eighty.
- Hey, come on,

35:23.150 --> 35:26.590
an eighty up from a fifty seven
is pretty good for two week.

35:27.230 --> 35:30.629
Yeah, but you've to get five
points if it was the real test.

35:30.630 --> 35:31.909
No backing out now.

35:31.910 --> 35:36.030
You promised a celebration
lunch if I even broke seventy.

35:48.790 --> 35:51.750
- You had this planned.
- Of course.

35:51.790 --> 35:54.469
Not only lunch but now you
have the rare opportunity

35:54.470 --> 35:56.589
to practice your new
vocabulary under fire.

35:56.590 --> 35:58.590
Great.

36:13.430 --> 36:17.189
Now, I'm going to teach you a skill
that all young men should know.

36:17.190 --> 36:18.590
What's that?

36:18.710 --> 36:22.949
- The art of tasting wine.
- Sounds vital.

36:22.950 --> 36:26.590
It's where you can impress all the
girls before you seduce them.

36:26.630 --> 36:28.990
Now it sounds life or death.

36:29.030 --> 36:33.070
First thing you do is...
sniff the bouquet.

36:33.350 --> 36:36.589
Then you take a healthy sip, and
you move it around your mouth

36:36.590 --> 36:40.430
so that the tongue can test
it from all sides. Like so.

36:48.390 --> 36:54.150
You're not supposed to gargle,
Can't take you anywhere.

36:59.590 --> 37:02.588
So, Cindy, put through all
my calls to Le Rendezvous.

37:02.589 --> 37:04.870
I'm trying to close the condo deal.

37:07.390 --> 37:10.869
Be very careful. She's an
absolutely flawless classic.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.630
Yes, sir.

37:12.830 --> 37:16.630
Not a scratch. Okay, my man?

37:17.190 --> 37:18.950
Right, sir.

37:22.670 --> 37:24.470
Pierre, how are you?

37:25.590 --> 37:26.710
My table over here?

37:29.887 --> 37:31.354
Roger hi. Ed.

37:39.134 --> 37:40.726
Oh, no. Anything but this.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.995
Where have you been?
Why did you disappear?

37:48.232 --> 37:50.822
Why haven't you called me?
I've been looking for you for weeks.

37:52.778 --> 37:54.958
Why do you want me to
say this again? It's over.

37:55.095 --> 37:58.957
It can't be over. You just get up
and walked out. Not a word, nothing.

38:01.407 --> 38:03.772
I don't know what you want me
to say, It's just not fair!

38:04.374 --> 38:06.571
Fair? One day you're living
with me and the next day

38:06.678 --> 38:09.467
you disappear without a goodbye.
And you're talking about fair?

38:09.655 --> 38:11.894
Monsieur Sylvester. There is
a telephone call for you.

38:12.538 --> 38:13.604
I'll call back.

38:13.612 --> 38:15.439
But your secretary says
it is an emergency.

38:21.041 --> 38:22.577
Yes Cindy, put him through.

38:24.514 --> 38:25.491
Hello, Sid...

38:26.428 --> 38:29.673
I just talked with Miller and if you
want those condos they'll cost you

38:29.674 --> 38:30.776
two hundred K a piece..

38:33.116 --> 38:35.372
I love you, Terry.
Forget what happened.

38:36.179 --> 38:39.717
That's over, honey. I can change.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.772
Sid, the price is right.
He'll take one third down.

38:42.773 --> 38:44.812
The terms are terrific.

38:44.813 --> 38:47.667
- Yeah, that's right.
- Let's go.

38:47.668 --> 38:50.189
No problem. Wait, Terry don't go.

38:50.190 --> 38:52.389
I said I love you. Doesn't
that mean anything?

38:52.390 --> 38:55.029
I wanna be with you!
I wanna be with you forever!

38:55.030 --> 38:57.190
How can you turn down
an offer like that?

38:57.510 --> 39:03.109
You'll be turning over a half million
profit in eighteen months, goddamnit.

39:03.110 --> 39:06.589
Would you just wait a
second, Terry? Talk to me.

39:06.590 --> 39:09.356
No, not you, Sid. Is your name
Terry, for Christ sakes?

39:09.363 --> 39:12.674
Goddammit, Sid. Just
take the bloody deal.

39:24.590 --> 39:28.869
Would you just talk to me? I can't
keep this up, I gave up jogging.

39:28.870 --> 39:32.670
Who is this kid? Are you
teaching nursery school or what?

42:27.513 --> 42:29.518
Nice night for a stroll, huh, Bobby.

42:30.945 --> 42:34.807
I couldn't sleep...
I had my telescope out.

42:36.307 --> 42:38.746
You shouldn't spy on people.
It's not fair.

42:44.031 --> 42:45.589
Bobby? Would you look at me.

42:48.379 --> 42:52.077
It's okay. Just no more spying.
Is that understood?

42:52.820 --> 42:54.510
Okay. Go to bed.

43:01.729 --> 43:05.175
Well, this way boys, over there. Oh
this is gonna look wonderful today.

43:05.176 --> 43:08.374
Yes there is the place.

43:09.374 --> 43:15.170
No, no... no... no I like it better
over there. Yes, that's it.

43:15.171 --> 43:18.178
Yes, definitely over there.

43:18.803 --> 43:20.597
No, wait please.

43:20.757 --> 43:24.796
I think I like it where we tried
it the first time. Right here.

43:25.523 --> 43:26.809
What do you think?

43:26.810 --> 43:29.776
Oh, it's so hard to decide
without setting it all up.

43:29.777 --> 43:31.706
It takes an hour to set
this tent up ma'am.

43:31.707 --> 43:32.537
An hour?

43:35.010 --> 43:36.002
Is that all?

43:38.718 --> 43:41.894
Well maybe we could set it up
in all the places I picked.

43:41.918 --> 43:42.744
What do you think?

43:42.745 --> 43:45.828
- Hi mom. Where's Terry?
- Hi honey.

43:45.829 --> 43:48.167
She went for a drive. She said
she'll be back for your lesson.

43:48.168 --> 43:50.129
- A drive? With who?
- A man.

43:50.130 --> 43:51.370
Honey, you know that tent we
have for your birthday...

43:51.371 --> 43:53.248
Where do you think
we should set it up?

43:53.249 --> 43:58.598
Over there... Over there...
Or over here?

44:01.729 --> 44:03.743
- I think it looks fine, right here.
- Oh, fine.

44:05.049 --> 44:09.126
Thank you honey. Ok boys.
Set it up. Right here.

44:09.698 --> 44:12.668
Wait!... I am not sure.

44:25.674 --> 44:27.110
Where were you?

44:28.079 --> 44:29.932
- You're late.
- Not that late.

44:31.983 --> 44:34.232
Hey, sport. Don't get
so bent out of shape.

44:35.406 --> 44:39.750
I guess you and I got off on the
wrong foot. I'm Don Sylvester.

44:41.437 --> 44:44.895
You know you almost made me
wrap my bike around that pole.

44:44.896 --> 44:45.957
I'm sorry about that.

44:45.958 --> 44:48.009
I was a desperate
man, though Bobby.

44:48.010 --> 44:53.020
I couldn't let my girl get away
without a chase now, could I?

44:57.841 --> 44:58.933
Well, I gotta go.

44:59.529 --> 45:02.060
- Study time? You know?
- I'll be right there.

45:34.586 --> 45:36.769
All right. Here you are.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.657
Come on Bobby, what's that long
face, huh? Can you fetch us a smile?

45:42.987 --> 45:46.168
Yeah, we got in this picture at
6:05 and there's not a blonde here.

45:46.894 --> 45:48.452
This'll never work, Billy.

45:48.989 --> 45:50.907
Trust me and ye shall be delivered.

45:50.908 --> 45:52.833
Look, the guy at the door
is a friend of mine.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.557
These are just for show.
I've got you covered, huh?

45:54.558 --> 45:55.628
Wonderful.

45:56.238 --> 45:58.764
Bobby, you look like
you're going to a funeral.

45:59.784 --> 46:00.871
What's the matter?

46:02.039 --> 46:04.289
- Nothing. Let's go.
- All right. Common.

46:17.896 --> 46:19.892
Oh shit! Duane's not here tonight

46:22.733 --> 46:24.927
Billy, this will never do!
This will never do!

46:25.423 --> 46:27.228
Too late now. Go for it!

46:28.465 --> 46:30.022
Hey Blood! What's happenin', man?
All right, all right!

46:30.023 --> 46:31.851
Please blood, please!

46:47.983 --> 46:50.891
Don, it's Terry. Don?

46:53.978 --> 46:56.952
And stay out, punks!

47:00.875 --> 47:02.973
What the hell's wrong
with you, guys?

47:03.605 --> 47:05.185
You're nuts to go
jump into that ring!

47:06.452 --> 47:10.338
I couldn't help myself. They're the
most beautiful girls in the world.

47:10.758 --> 47:14.466
Yeah, we're going to wait for them.
That blonde is crazy for me.

47:15.103 --> 47:18.618
I could tell. When she was pinning
me, she was really getting off.

47:18.772 --> 47:19.632
I'll be in the car.

47:28.475 --> 47:31.325
Can you believe those guys?
They must be crazy!

48:12.894 --> 48:15.007
Don't you get out of
the car you bastard.

48:16.315 --> 48:18.412
- I can explain...
- Come on!

48:19.924 --> 48:21.304
You weren't supposed to be here.

48:21.658 --> 48:23.158
I don't believe you're saying this!

48:24.338 --> 48:26.737
Don't get out of the car.
I am going to cut it off....

48:48.387 --> 48:49.637
- Excuse me girls.
- Aaaah!

48:50.290 --> 48:52.457
We just want to tell you how
much we enjoy your work...

48:52.458 --> 48:54.825
Well, if there is any way to
wrestle with you privately...

48:54.826 --> 48:58.086
Also, it may be of some interest to you
that I am unusually well endowed and

48:58.087 --> 49:00.640
would be happy to demonstrate
that fact at any moment.

49:00.837 --> 49:02.003
You little turds again.

49:04.605 --> 49:05.905
I'm gonna break you in pieces.

49:26.792 --> 49:28.931
I love her! I love her!

49:32.512 --> 49:36.406
Put my dress back here! I'm naked!

49:53.291 --> 49:54.122
Hi, Terry!

49:54.810 --> 49:56.551
Oh! Hi Bobby!

49:57.558 --> 49:58.515
Mind if I sit down?

49:59.272 --> 50:00.192
No, please!

50:06.558 --> 50:08.767
So, it looks like things
didn't work out, huh?

50:10.269 --> 50:11.966
No.

50:14.461 --> 50:17.767
- You were right about him.
- What happened?

50:19.971 --> 50:23.067
Let's just say one woman's
not enough for him.

50:27.241 --> 50:28.414
I'm sorry to hear that..

50:30.153 --> 50:31.529
Thanks.

50:32.226 --> 50:35.284
Well, actually, I'm
glad you're here.

50:36.378 --> 50:38.150
It's nice to be wanted somewhere.

50:39.484 --> 50:40.725
What did you do tonight?

50:42.509 --> 50:43.682
Nothing special.

50:45.264 --> 50:48.085
We watched a couple of ladies roll
around in the mud and get all wet.

50:50.002 --> 50:51.601
Sounds exciting.

50:52.237 --> 50:53.362
It wasn't.

50:56.630 --> 50:59.600
- I was thinking about you.
- What were you thinking?

51:02.104 --> 51:05.059
I guess... I was jealous.

51:09.752 --> 51:10.998
Hey, what's wrong?

51:10.999 --> 51:13.624
Nothing... nothing. I got to go.

51:13.823 --> 51:21.780
Terry, I'm really sorry this
guy hurt your feelings.

51:23.013 --> 51:26.690
Thank you.

57:16.488 --> 57:21.003
Robert, I've been looking for
you want to speak to you.

57:21.260 --> 57:22.109
Yes, sir.

57:22.591 --> 57:24.659
How long have I known you...

57:25.100 --> 57:28.425
How long have your father and
I been business associates?

57:29.887 --> 57:31.323
- All my life.
- That's right.

57:31.423 --> 57:32.449
All your life. So...

57:33.854 --> 57:36.833
You would say I have your
best interests at heart.

57:37.404 --> 57:38.384
Yes, I would say that.

57:38.931 --> 57:42.668
And I want to say one word
to you Robert. Just one word.

57:43.796 --> 57:44.782
Computer chips.

57:47.087 --> 57:48.163
Computer...

57:48.930 --> 57:51.295
- Computer chips.
- That's two words.

57:51.296 --> 57:54.351
It's the future. Never forget that.

58:03.383 --> 58:05.262
- Hi boys.
- Hello.

58:05.647 --> 58:08.362
- Oh, hello, hello Mrs. Crystal.
- Oh, thank you.

58:11.592 --> 58:14.000
- Good punch?
- It's terrific!

58:14.668 --> 58:16.261
It is the very best.

58:16.542 --> 58:20.587
Thank you. Go easy, it has
a very heavy kick to it.

58:29.273 --> 58:30.334
Oh, my, nice.

58:31.730 --> 58:33.991
Now you want a little more
now don't you, Mrs. Crystal?

58:34.456 --> 58:38.772
- No. No.
- O yes yes. Just a little.

58:40.486 --> 58:41.818
Easy does it.

58:50.130 --> 58:51.458
Terry!

58:51.989 --> 58:53.872
May I speak with you.

58:56.490 --> 59:01.142
- Sure.
- Would you mind refilling my drink for me.

59:03.268 --> 59:04.506
Not at all. Its scotch, right?

59:04.507 --> 59:06.973
That's right. And while it,
make one for yourself.

59:08.215 --> 59:09.252
No, thank you.

59:11.963 --> 59:16.780
So, how's Bobby doing?
Is he really applying himself?

59:17.288 --> 59:19.565
He's doing great.
He's working very hard.

59:20.817 --> 59:22.366
And you're very fond of him.

59:22.868 --> 59:24.595
Yeah.

59:24.761 --> 59:29.784
No, have a sit. Come on Sit here
and talk with me over my drink.

59:35.738 --> 59:37.047
How's the party going?

59:38.584 --> 59:40.983
Lively. That band is
really interesting.

59:42.417 --> 59:45.783
I hate parties.
It's my wife's idea.

59:46.269 --> 59:50.221
She has so few, I like to indulge
the occasion one she has.

59:52.004 --> 59:56.844
Hey, can we cut through
this small talk, Terry?

59:56.845 --> 59:59.658
I find you very, very attractive.

01:00:01.358 --> 01:00:03.739
And to come right to the point,
I would like to sleep you.

01:00:05.194 --> 01:00:07.331
It would be worth a
great deal to me.

01:00:07.332 --> 01:00:09.421
I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:00:11.049 --> 01:00:12.822
- Really?
- Really.

01:00:15.563 --> 01:00:16.979
Why not?

01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:20.445
You see, I just don't like men

01:00:20.446 --> 01:00:23.386
who think they can have anything they
want just because they have money.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:25.468
Is that to the point enough to you.

01:00:33.641 --> 01:00:36.547
Slut!

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:01.939
Hi.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.039
Hi, Bonnie, how you been?

01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:07.975
Good. You look terrific.

01:01:08.513 --> 01:01:09.608
What did you do?

01:01:09.818 --> 01:01:11.456
Nothing. Same old me.

01:01:11.706 --> 01:01:18.310
No. There's somethin' different
You must be chasing some girl.

01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:19.913
Who is she?

01:01:20.534 --> 01:01:24.666
There's no one. How about you.
Still seeing that college guy.

01:01:25.372 --> 01:01:26.550
Biff? Sure.

01:01:27.455 --> 01:01:31.963
Biff. C'mon, nobody's named Biff.

01:01:34.151 --> 01:01:36.722
- I do Believe you're jealous.
- Baloney.

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:04.376
I love her. She's fantastic.

01:02:05.293 --> 01:02:10.507
No. She hates you like poison.
She's always hated you.

01:02:11.342 --> 01:02:12.763
Oh come on, she's crazy about me.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.177
Sue Anne, would you
care to dance with me?

01:02:22.388 --> 01:02:23.446
No thank you.

01:02:25.123 --> 01:02:27.464
Then I suppose a blow job
completely out of the question.

01:02:39.453 --> 01:02:41.537
- Hi.
- Well, Bobby,

01:02:41.866 --> 01:02:45.508
I'm not sure this is right. I'm
worried you getting a wrong idea.

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:47.569
Like what?

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.667
Like this is more serious than it is.
I don't want you to get hurt. Okay.

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:55.802
Terry, don't worry about me. I am
not the sensitive, vulnerable type,

01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:58.324
You're not. What type are you.

01:02:59.307 --> 01:03:02.227
The lewd, crude, couldn't
give a dame type.

01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:06.685
Come on in before your
parents catch us.

01:03:47.053 --> 01:03:50.690
And why, pray tell, are you
sneaking from my bed, sir?

01:03:52.122 --> 01:03:55.096
Because my parents are gonna
to be up any minute now.

01:03:59.405 --> 01:04:00.456
Terry.

01:04:01.848 --> 01:04:03.536
Something I have to
know before I go.

01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:05.315
Yeah.

01:04:12.943 --> 01:04:13.813
How am I doing?

01:04:15.722 --> 01:04:17.249
I don't have anything to go on.

01:04:18.748 --> 01:04:20.621
You know nothing to compare.

01:04:23.516 --> 01:04:24.877
Bobby you're wonderful.

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:33.874
How about on a scale of one to ten.

01:04:41.534 --> 01:04:44.962
You're a ten... well... you're nine
and a half, nobody is perfect.

01:04:49.536 --> 01:04:52.259
- You gotta go.
- Yeah, right.

01:05:38.931 --> 01:05:40.073
Son.

01:05:43.018 --> 01:05:44.959
You better get up or
you're gonna be all stiff.

01:05:46.052 --> 01:05:46.774
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:47.248 --> 01:05:49.644
You pulled an all night.
I'm proud of you.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:53.204
- But I think you better go to sleep.
- Good idea, Dad.

01:06:36.048 --> 01:06:37.454
- What do you want?
- I'm here to see Terry.

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:39.824
- Get out of my way.
- She's not home.

01:06:40.336 --> 01:06:41.645
I will see about that.

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.402
- I told you.
- I'll wait.

01:07:03.074 --> 01:07:07.613
The hell you will. Look your
trespassing. Now get lost.

01:07:08.136 --> 01:07:09.196
Don't make threats to me

01:07:09.922 --> 01:07:12.657
I'm a third degree
black belt in Karate.

01:07:12.658 --> 01:07:15.039
I know a hundred different ways
to bust you up in seconds.

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:16.472
Wait here.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.971
I only know one way to
squeeze this trigger.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:52.290
Hi! What can I do for you?

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:57.145
I'm looking for a night
gown for my aunt.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.260
If it's for your aunt, I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.011
I suggest you Roebuck.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.538
Well, actually it's
for my girlfriend.

01:09:07.406 --> 01:09:10.986
Girlfriend. That's more like it.
Is she tall, short...

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:15.113
Skinny, fat, big bosom, flat
chested, what's the story?

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.252
Medium size. And very
well put together.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:20.359
Oh, you are a diplomat, aren't you.

01:09:21.817 --> 01:09:22.899
And how old is she?

01:09:24.712 --> 01:09:25.734
Thirty.

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:32.209
Thirty? Not bad. Not bad.
A modern relationship. I like it.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.435
I think I have just
the thing for you.

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:42.015
As you can see

01:09:42.017 --> 01:09:46.106
a matching set of leather restrainers
and riding crop to go with this.

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:51.728
I think that's a little too much.

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.687
- Too much?
- Yeah.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.850
Hi, Bobby.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:29.330
Hi Bonnie.

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.170
Whatcha reading?

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:34.290
Nothing. Schoolwork.

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:35.690
What subject?

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:37.770
French.

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:00.930
Looks like fun.

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:22.449
Good night, Bobby. We'll be at
the Marshalls if you need us.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.089
Good night, Mom.
You have good time.

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:27.170
Jack called earlier, are you
gonna to see him tonight?

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:30.289
I guess so. I don't know.

01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:33.050
Well, whatever you
do, have good time.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.810
I will.

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.729
Are you kidding with this?

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.889
Put your... put your knee, up there.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:01.850
No human being can twist like that.

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:04.289
Where is my foot?

01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:06.609
- Wait a second.
- Is that you?

01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:09.169
- Is there someone else in you?
- That is the way.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.810
- I don't think that's the....
- But that's in the book.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.370
Don't believe everything
you read... just...

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.170
Bobby...

01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:31.770
Making love has nothing to do
with those wild positions.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.010
It's got to do with feelings.

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.490
And, honey, you definitely
got the feeling.

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:49.969
I don't know. I'm not sure I wanna
go to Stanford Law in the fall.

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:54.010
Maybe I should just go to Berkley and
take advantage of the institution.

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:58.249
Papa has his heart
set on Stanford..

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.010
All the boys have gone there.

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:04.610
All the same, I'm a bit partial
to being closer to San Francisco.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.130
Good morning, Mrs. Chrystal.

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:15.690
Maria... you... Water... plant.

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:23.010
Si... yes... water.

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.890
Manuel. Lawn. Mow?

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:34.370
Mow?

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:35.490
Que?

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:43.609
Cut? Cut. Cut, cut, cut.
Cut, cut...

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.970
Ah, si, cut. Cut, cut,

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.656
Muy bien.

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:57.450
Oh, I just love talking Spanish.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.970
Terry, guess what? They're goin
away for a whole weekend.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:08.129
Now if I can only get rid
of Manual and Maria...

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:09.849
You make it sound like
a murder mystery.

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:11.410
Just give them the weekend off?

01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:15.090
Great idea. Now why
didn't I think of that?

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:30.410
- Terry, you have to talk to me.
- Go away, it's over!

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.169
- Are you and this kid getting on?
- Get lost, you creep!

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:34.529
You stay out of this.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:37.609
Terry, I love you. You
know you are the only one.

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:39.929
- Bugger off.
- Drop dead.

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:44.569
- Please leave us alone.
- Us? You two are making it.

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:47.249
- What if we are?
- I can't believe it.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:50.770
Well, it's true. And he is
ten times the lover you are!

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:53.170
I'll kill you!

01:15:56.530 --> 01:16:00.490
My baby. My baby.

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:03.569
My baby.

01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:05.770
Thank God he's all right.

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.649
All right. Common now, let's pull
him out, it's such a beautiful day.

01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:21.769
Raphael, would you put
those things in the trunk.

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.929
Darling, his name is Manuel.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.570
Dear, what's the difference.

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:28.570
Raphael, Manuel, all right?

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:31.250
Keep your eye on the ball.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.530
I love you... be a good boy.

01:16:40.558 --> 01:16:42.040
Thank you, honey.

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.497
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:57.366
No, no, that's it Raphael.
Put those down.

01:16:57.410 --> 01:17:02.370
All right, son, It's all yours
now... Hold the fort.

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.330
Thanks dad.

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:22.690
Hey, Manuel, can I speak
to you for a second?

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.330
Si Senor.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.330
Why not you and Maria
take the weekend off.

01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:32.969
Come on, Manuel, knock it off.

01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:36.250
I know you and Maria
speak perfect English.

01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:40.010
How long have you known?

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.850
Couple of years.

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:45.490
It's all right.
Your secret safe with me.

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:49.170
Just take the weekend
off yourselves.

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.529
We will.

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:54.130
And, Bobby, gracias.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:02.730
Hmmm, Bobby, you're wonderful.

01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:09.290
Bobby. How long can
you keep that up.

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:11.210
As long as I want.

01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:31.489
Billy, I don't see why we can't go
back to the whorehouse tonight.

01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:32.569
Are you kidding?

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.969
You whacked all their stuff.
They'd shoot you on sight.

01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:37.170
Picky, picky, picky.

01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:38.769
There's always Mexico.

01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.249
They could march you
right down main streets

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.449
to get ten dollar bill in your
teeth and your problem over.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:49.663
No. I am not going to
Mexico No way Jose.

01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:43.362
Mexico!

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:51.132
- Bobby.
- Hmmm.

01:19:51.603 --> 01:19:55.036
What do you think your parents would
say if they could see us, right now.

01:19:56.916 --> 01:20:00.471
- They don't say anything.

01:20:01.133 --> 01:20:05.419
I think they just hear the sounds.

01:20:07.453 --> 01:20:09.180
Do you think, they suspect anything.

01:20:11.129 --> 01:20:13.562
- No. I doubt it.
- Phew. That's good.

01:20:14.263 --> 01:20:17.726
Because, some day I may have to ask
them for a reference, you know.

01:20:17.727 --> 01:20:20.328
- I'll give you one hell of a reference.
- I'm sure you would.

01:20:24.074 --> 01:20:26.446
That's not going to help
me in teaching work.

01:20:26.896 --> 01:20:28.476
Why you don't come
to collage with me.

01:20:28.902 --> 01:20:31.982
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of
subjects I'm going to have trouble with.

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:33.481
I only teach French.

01:20:38.506 --> 01:20:43.148
Maybe I can major in French.
Who knows? If I study hard enough.

01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:46.519
I could become a Frenchman.

01:20:50.144 --> 01:20:53.439
Nope, after the summer
the tutoring stops.

01:20:54.256 --> 01:20:55.292
All the tutoring?

01:20:59.439 --> 01:21:00.520
Yes.

01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:04.260
Don't say anymore...

01:21:27.293 --> 01:21:28.504
Where's the wine?

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.116
So, Bobby,

01:21:37.188 --> 01:21:39.989
Terry tells me that you have a heavy
crammed session this weekend.

01:21:40.932 --> 01:21:42.193
Oh we have.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.676
And you're ready for
the exam tomorrow?

01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:46.324
I'm sure I'm dad.

01:21:47.012 --> 01:21:48.890
I'm really happy about
your dedication Bobby.

01:21:55.064 --> 01:21:57.321
- Dad. I've been thinking.
- Hmmmm.

01:21:58.704 --> 01:22:00.512
What if I didn't go to Yale.

01:22:01.139 --> 01:22:02.836
What if I went to UCLA instead.

01:22:03.959 --> 01:22:06.427
All my friends are
goin there and...

01:22:07.243 --> 01:22:09.436
Bobby, there isn't any
ambition among your friends.

01:22:10.148 --> 01:22:12.575
You're going to go to Yale and
make something of yourself.

01:22:13.287 --> 01:22:15.057
But UCLA has a terrific
astronomy department...

01:22:15.058 --> 01:22:22.253
Bobby, looking through a telescope, it's
my idea of how to become successful.

01:22:23.055 --> 01:22:25.217
No, but it's a good way
to become an astronomer.

01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:28.447
That's quite enough,
Bobby. I know...

01:22:30.055 --> 01:22:32.273
it's gonna be tough at Yale. But

01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:36.717
it's only under pressure that you
find out what you're really made of.

01:22:38.466 --> 01:22:40.288
It's going to make a man
out of you. Really.

01:22:41.366 --> 01:22:42.824
So stiffen your resolve.

01:22:44.489 --> 01:22:47.901
A good education is vital for
getting somewhere in this world.

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.349
Let's not hear any more
talk about U.C.L.A.

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.939
or stargazing. Understand?

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:58.840
- Sure, Dad. No more star gazing.
- Drink your milk.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:16.750
To Finish. Je finis, tu finis il finit
nous finissons vous finissez...

01:23:20.432 --> 01:23:23.764
Et finis. You're ready.

01:23:31.178 --> 01:23:32.866
No, no, Bobby.

01:23:33.412 --> 01:23:35.770
Hey, come on, I'm tense.

01:23:36.192 --> 01:23:39.345
I got to relax. Big
gain tomorrow you know.

01:23:46.692 --> 01:23:48.435
See, that's just the point.

01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:51.228
I don't want you to
do a scoring in bed.

01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:54.720
Now should you to get up...
come on...

01:23:56.246 --> 01:23:59.492
Get a good night's sleep and
the score on your exam.

01:24:00.186 --> 01:24:02.490
And then?

01:24:02.962 --> 01:24:06.922
And then, we'll see.

01:24:43.573 --> 01:24:44.913
What happened? What did you get?

01:24:46.467 --> 01:24:48.120
Oh, Bobby tell me.

01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:50.393
Ninety one.

01:24:50.394 --> 01:24:53.792
Ninety-one!

01:24:53.898 --> 01:24:57.707
Oh, that's great, ninety one.

01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:03.980
Ninety one.

01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:18.793
- Let's keep going.
- You're crazy.

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.965
No, I mean it. Let's go
San Francisco. I've got money.

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:23.787
We can't go to San Francisco.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:28.180
Sure we can. Hey, I'm packing
a 132 dollars and 45 cents.

01:25:28.816 --> 01:25:30.801
I already got
reservation in Carmel.

01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:32.728
Bobby, you gotta go back.

01:25:51.506 --> 01:25:53.315
Too serious huh?

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:57.530
I just want to be alone with you
for a couple of days. That's all.

01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:59.610
Is that so serious?

01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:02.210
People do it all the time.

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:05.009
I've to get back to
the house. I have

01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:07.729
a lot of loose ends to
tie up before I go.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.970
Go? Go where?

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:13.330
I'm going to visit
my family in France.

01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:15.370
France?

01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:18.970
You haven't told me anything about
France. When did this come about.

01:26:18.971 --> 01:26:23.850
I made the reservations last
week and I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.930
You going to France?

01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:30.250
You never told you gone leave me?

01:26:30.370 --> 01:26:32.850
Bobby, I'm not leaving you.

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:35.850
I'm going away, that's all.

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:38.129
- Same difference.
- No. No.

01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:40.730
It's a very big difference.

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:44.010
Yeah. Either way you're leaving me.

01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:56.210
Bobby, may I see you
for moment please?

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:12.089
Congratulations.

01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:15.649
The school just called.
I'm very proud of you.

01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:17.289
Thanks dad.

01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:19.410
I now have the

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.529
bittersweet obligation
of having to pay

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:24.650
Miss Green that bonus of
ten thousand dollars.

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:30.369
Terry gets a ten thousand
dollar bonus because I passed?

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.170
She didn't tell you?

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:40.010
Maybe that's why she gave you
such special attention all summer.

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:44.130
People don't always do things
for best of motives, do they.

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.050
Bobby, sit down.
There's more I want to say to you.

01:27:47.051 --> 01:27:49.449
That's okay. You said quite enough.

01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:53.009
- Listen to me.
- No! You listen to me.

01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:55.409
All my life I've been
listening to you.

01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:57.169
Now I've got something
I want to say.

01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:58.529
Drop it.

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.690
I'm going to UCLA this
fall, to stargaze.

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:03.730
That's where you'll find me.

01:28:10.690 --> 01:28:12.929
Bobby, what happened?
What did he say?

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:15.569
Is it true that you get Ten
thousand dollars Because I passed.

01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:18.049
That was your father's idea.
He insisted on it..

01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:19.729
Not that you objected.

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.769
That's how you got the
ticket to France, right?

01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:22.930
Yes, But... it has...

01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:25.729
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because It has nothing to do with it.

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:27.530
Like hell it doesn't.

01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:30.649
God, I should have seen
this coming all along.

01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:32.729
Why didn't you just talk to
me at the beginning, huh?

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:36.330
How you could've made some kind
of arrangement. Like hooker!

01:28:36.331 --> 01:28:39.690
How could you say that to me?

01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:54.050
Bonnie.

01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:06.729
Bobby, what are you doing here?

01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:08.930
Bonnie, I have to talk with you.

01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.410
All right, I'll be right out.

01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:29.210
What's up?

01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:32.130
Bonnie...

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:36.770
Will you go to the movies
with me on Saturday night?

01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:40.889
Bobby, you came over here at
two o' clock in the morning

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:42.930
to ask me for the movies?

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:45.850
What do you expect
me to do, telephone?

01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:49.810
Yeah, that's the way
guys usually do it.

01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:55.370
- But the problem is I promised Biff...
- Forget Biff.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.610
- Forget Biff?
- He's through. Finished.

01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:03.009
- He is too old for you.
- Too old. He's only twenty.

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:05.410
Way too old.

01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:08.250
Why don't you pick on
someone your own age?

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.090
Who is that?

01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:13.930
Me for instance.

01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:21.090
Bobby... you know you are like...

01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:19.810
I'm sorry about what
I said yesterday.

01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:22.050
I was stupid.

01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:25.570
I'm sorry that I hit you.

01:32:26.690 --> 01:32:28.930
I wish you would've shot me.

01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:36.170
So where were you last night.
Everyone was so worried about you.

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:39.730
I was over at Bonnie's.

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:44.769
Yeah, I think it's
time for me to go.

01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:48.570
Otherwise Bonnie is gonna
have big fight on her hands.

01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:02.890
So, it's off to France.

01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:08.089
You sure you don't
want me to come along?

01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:12.090
Come like a translator.
For the tough words.

01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:15.330
I think I'm going to win
this one on my own.

01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:25.690
I'm going to forget you.

01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:31.410
No, you are not.

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:36.730
No, I'm not.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:52.010
I can hear the clock
measuring ecstasy.

01:33:52.389 --> 01:33:59.228
Every sound inside a touch

01:34:00.411 --> 01:34:06.588
I can hear the warm
music of you and me

01:34:07.182 --> 01:34:15.282
It's the first time
We made love

01:34:15.582 --> 01:34:20.782
The first time
We made love

01:34:21.305 --> 01:34:27.334
