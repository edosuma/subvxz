THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.498
WE'RE OUT OF ICE CREAM.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.199
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING

00:33.266 --> 00:34.467
I KNOW.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.370

01:21.614 --> 01:22.549
SALEM, HELP ME.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.250
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T CARE.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.118
OH, I CARE.

01:25.185 --> 01:28.254
I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT YOUR...
WHAT WAS IT?

TO CALL MY BOOKIE.

GET TOGETHER
AND STUDY TONIGHT?

04:15.421 --> 04:16.990
YOU AND ME?

04:17.056 --> 04:18.424
THAT'S WHAT "WE" MEANS.

04:18.491 --> 04:19.559
YEAH, SURE.

04:19.626 --> 04:20.893
OH, WAIT. I CAN'T.

WHY I CAN'T GO
TO PARENTS' NIGHT.

THAT WE'RE TWO SISTERS LIVING
IN AN OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.127
YOU'LL ALWAYS GET
A BIG SMILE OUT OF HIM

WHAT SHOULD WE PLAY FIRST?

06:35.495 --> 06:36.763

06:36.829 --> 06:39.065
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID
IT WAS THE HOUSE

06:39.132 --> 06:41.067
WITH THE FLYING DUCK
ON THE MAILBOX.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.802

SO IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.409
NOT THAT I PLANNED IT THAT WAY.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.413
HEY, LOOK,
THEY'VE GOT A TV.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.850
I BET THE WORLD SERIES
WOULD LOOK GREAT ON THAT

06:57.917 --> 06:59.185
BUT I CAME HERE TO STUDY.

RIGHT, SO...

07:01.521 --> 07:02.255
LET'S STUDY.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.891

AREN'T VERY GOOD.

07:04.957 --> 07:06.692

THERE'S POPSI.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.932
I THINK I'LL HAVE
A DIET POPSI.

07:45.998 --> 07:49.502
SO, SHOULD WE GET

07:49.569 --> 07:51.003

INTO BASEBALL, HUH?

08:33.579 --> 08:35.047
SPORTS AREN'T
MY ONLY INTEREST.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.049
I DON'T TELL A LOT
OF PEOPLE THIS

08:37.116 --> 08:39.252
BUT SOMEDAY, I WANT
TO BE A DENTIST.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.786
A DENTIST? THAT'S GREAT.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.622
WHO DOESN'T LOVE
THE DENTIST?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.857
AND I'VE NOTICED YOU
HAVE GOOD TEETH.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.125
I DO?

08:46.192 --> 08:49.028
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
A PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.063
IT'S JUST ME.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.632
(<i> baby whimpering</i> )

08:52.698 --> 08:53.766
OH, EXCUSE ME.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.835
I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK.

09:01.741 --> 09:04.076
OH, IT'S OKAY, MR. KAZOOTIE.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.845
COME HERE. DON'T BE SAD.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.079
COME HERE.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.848
BIG BOYS DON'T CRY.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.150
COME ON, BE A BIG BOY.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.785
BE A BIG BOY.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.820
BE A BIG BOY.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.589
THAT'S BETTER.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.036
We go to the bottom
of the ninth and a yawner.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.871
Somebody do something.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.806
WELL, THE BABY'S
GOT HIS BOTTLE NOW.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.741
SHALL WE GET BACK
TO "MITOSIS IS"?

09:35.808 --> 09:36.909
YEAH, RIGHT.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.078
I MEAN, THE TEST
IS TOMORROW.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.579
I REALLY GOT TO FOCUS.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.281
"MITOSIS IS..."

09:42.348 --> 09:43.649
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:43.716 --> 09:45.117
BETTER GO CHECK
THE BABY.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.888
COMING, RUDY.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.022
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.257
OH, MY GOD!

09:51.324 --> 09:53.292
RUDY, IS THAT YOU?

09:53.359 --> 09:54.360
BA-BA.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.030
OH, MR. KAZOOTIE.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.171
I'M IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.672
I BROKE THE BABY.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.273
BAH-BAH.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.808
WE HAVE TO UNDO THIS.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.376
PRESTO CHANGE-O,
GO BACK TO NORMAL.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.144
BAH-BAH.

10:12.211 --> 10:12.979
<i>BAH-BAH.</i>

10:13.045 --> 10:14.213
OH, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.650
HERE'S YOUR BAH-BAH.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.618
THIS IS SO CREEPY.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.954
WE'VE GOT TO GET HELP.

10:22.021 --> 10:22.855
BANKIE?

10:22.922 --> 10:24.190
YOU KEEP YOUR BANKIE

10:24.256 --> 10:26.058
TILL AFTER WE
GET YOU DRESSED.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.193
SABRINA,
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

10:27.259 --> 10:28.894
NOPE. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.930
WHY DON'T YOU,
UH, WATCH THE GAME?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.331
IT'S ONE STRIKE FROM THE END.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.667
UNLESS THIS GUY
KNOCKS ONE OUT,
IT'S OVER.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.135
HEY, LOOK!

10:36.202 --> 10:38.170
It's a home run!

10:38.237 --> 10:39.772
UNBELIEVABLE...

10:39.839 --> 10:42.208
Folks, we're going
into extra innings.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.709
YOU COULD HELP A LITTLE.

10:43.776 --> 10:44.710
NOSE.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.178
OW. THAT'S NOT HELPING.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.713
OKAY, THERE.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.015
DON'T SPIT UP

10:49.081 --> 10:51.317
ON YOUR DAD'S
SUIT JACKET, OKAY?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.351
UP... UP.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.686
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING?

10:53.753 --> 10:55.321
(<i> phone rings</i> )

10:55.388 --> 10:56.989
GOT TO GET THE PHONE.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.357
DID SHE ANSWER YET?

10:58.424 --> 11:00.026
AM I TALKING?

11:00.092 --> 11:02.695
OH, HI, SABRINA.
YEAH, IT'S JERRY, RUDY'S DAD.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.730
IS HE OKAY? ASK
HER IF HE'S OKAY.

11:04.797 --> 11:05.865
I KNOW WHAT TO ASK.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.199
IS HE OKAY?

11:07.266 --> 11:09.368
YEAH, RUDY'S HAVING
A REAL GOOD TIME.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.170
HE'S RIDING
HIS BANANA RIGHT NOW.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.705
HOW'S YOUR DINNER?

11:12.772 --> 11:13.873
THEY WERE
LATE IN SEATING US.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.107
REALLY?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.442
BUT SINCE WE GOT A TABLE

11:16.509 --> 11:18.210
THEY'VE RUSHED
THE HECK OUT OF US.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.012
DON'T LET THEM.
YOU'RE THERE TO RELAX.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.447
TAKE ALL THE
TIME YOU WANT.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.349
THAT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU, SABRINA.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.217
WELL, WE WERE
JUST CHECKING IN

11:25.284 --> 11:26.685
SO WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

11:26.752 --> 11:27.686
HMM?

11:27.753 --> 11:29.055
OKAY, NOT TOO SOON.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.289
RIGHT. BYE.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.792
SEE? EVERYTHING'S FINE.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.026
I'M SORRY.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.694
IT'S JUST BEEN
SUCH A WEIRD DAY.

11:35.761 --> 11:39.098
YOU ALMOST WENT OFF THE ROAD
IN THAT FREAK SNOWSTORM

11:39.165 --> 11:41.333
AND NOW, I JUST HAVE
THE FUNNIEST FEELING.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.869
STOP WITH THE FEELINGS.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.705
HARVEY, I'M, UH,
GOING TO WALK THE BABY.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.841
YOU STAY HERE AND
WATCH THE GAME, OKAY?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.209
OKAY, BUT IT'S ALMOST OVER.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.044
ONLY A GRAND SLAM
WOULD TIE IT.

11:52.111 --> 11:54.980
He got a hold of that one!

11:55.047 --> 11:57.917
It's up... it's hanging there...

11:57.983 --> 11:59.752
It could be...

11:59.819 --> 12:01.720
It might be...

12:01.787 --> 12:04.123
It's a grand slam!

12:04.190 --> 12:05.891
ALL RIGHT!

12:05.958 --> 12:07.927
There's magic in the air!

<i>WELCOME, PARENTS.</i>

12:09.495 --> 12:11.263

12:11.330 --> 12:13.732
YOU MAY LOOK AT ME--
A MAN IN HIS PRIME--

12:13.799 --> 12:16.402
AND WONDER WHY
IS HE TEACHING
HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.404
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE

12:18.471 --> 12:21.907
THAT SCIENCE IS THE FOUNDATION
UPON WHICH WE BUILD OUR FUTURE.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.009
THAT AND I TANKED MY MCATs.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.344
MR. POOL IS CUTE.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.046
YOU HAVE GOT
TO GET OUT MORE.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.380
I WONDER IF HE'S SINGLE.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.015
EXCUSE ME.
IS THERE SOMETHING

12:30.082 --> 12:32.451
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH
THE REST OF THE CLASS.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.919
I NEED TO GO TO THE NURSE.

12:33.986 --> 12:37.223
IS THERE A PROBLEM...
MRS. SPELLMAN?

12:37.289 --> 12:38.791
YES, MY TUMMY...

12:38.858 --> 12:40.359
NO, SHE'S FINE...

12:40.426 --> 12:42.061
AND IT'S MISS SPELLMAN.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.195
WHO ARE YOU?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.864
OH, I'M ALSO MISS SPELLMAN.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.532
WE'RE SABRINA'S AUNTS.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.834
SISTERS-- NOT AN
ALTERNATIVE COUPLE.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.836
SO YOU'RE, UH... SINGLE?

12:50.903 --> 12:51.837
YES.

12:51.904 --> 12:52.872
AND YOU?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.540
EXTREMELY.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.310
NOW I REALLY AM GOING
TO THROW UP.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.148
OKAY, JUST SIT HERE.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.018
OKAY.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.053
HERE. YOU CAN READ YOUR BOOK.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.557
OR JUST CHEW ON IT.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.092
YES! YES!

13:13.159 --> 13:14.960
SALEM, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

13:15.027 --> 13:16.829
UH... NOTHING.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.564
YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH A BALL OF YARN.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.866
I HAVE URGES, SABRINA.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.468
CAN WE DEAL WITH
YOUR ISSUES LATER?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.470
I'VE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.239
MY YARN...

13:27.306 --> 13:29.074
OKAY, NOW,
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.510
DEAR LORD. YOU PICKED UP
A GUY AT THE BUS STATION.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.512
NO, IT'S THE BABY
I'M BABY-SITTING FOR.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.115
HE'S 14 MONTHS OLD.
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.850
DO I SMELL
TEEN WITCHERY?

13:37.917 --> 13:41.120
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE HIM BACK
BEFORE HIS PARENTS GET HOME.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.556
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO? I'M A CAT.

13:43.622 --> 13:44.890
TALK TO YOUR AUNTS.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.158
I CAN'T BRING HIM
TO SCHOOL.

13:46.225 --> 13:47.493
CAN YOU WATCH HIM?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.827
I-I SUPPOSE.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.396
THANKS. I OWE YOU ONE.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.531
HORSEY! RIDE HORSEY!

13:52.598 --> 13:54.166
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.235
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

13:58.137 --> 14:01.173
WHAT AN AMUSING
ERLENMEYER FLASK
STORY, MR. POOL.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.975
I'VE TOLD IT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.443
NO ONE'S EVER GOTTEN IT.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.611

14:05.678 --> 14:07.012

14:07.079 --> 14:08.547
WE SHOULD EXCHANGE E-MAIL.

WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.851

14:21.627 --> 14:23.128
YES.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.264

14:48.254 --> 14:49.922
UH, MR. SPELLMAN...

14:49.989 --> 14:52.358
HE LIKES TO BE CALLED
"MR. KAZOOTIE."

IT'S... SCOTTISH.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.228
I'M SCOTTISH TOO.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.098
I KNOW NOT OF THE CLAN KAZOOTIE.

14:59.164 --> 15:00.432
BE YOU A HIGHLANDER?

15:01.500 --> 15:02.534

15:04.470 --> 15:07.439

I GOT TO GO WORK THE BAKE SALE.

15:07.506 --> 15:11.010

BYE-BYE.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.180
YEAH, BYE-BYE.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.149
YES, UH, BYE-BYE
TO ALL OF YOU.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.351
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BABY-SITTING.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.487
I AM. THAT'S HIM.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.589
THAT'S THE LITTLE BABY?

15:23.656 --> 15:24.990
FUNNY CLOWN!

15:25.057 --> 15:25.691
WATCH IT.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.426
YOU GUYS HAVE TO HELP ME.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.094
RUDY'S PARENTS
WILL BE BACK SOON.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.597
I THINK THEY MIGHT NOTICE
THEY MISSED A BIG MOMENT

15:31.664 --> 15:33.565
IN THEIR SON'S LIFE!

15:33.632 --> 15:36.101
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE CAST
SOME KIND OF SPELL

15:36.168 --> 15:37.536
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REVERSE IT.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.271
THIS MAGIC
RUINS EVERYTHING.

15:39.338 --> 15:42.141
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HIS CRIB
SUCKING HIS THUMB

15:42.207 --> 15:43.475
AND I'M SUPPOSED

15:43.542 --> 15:44.977
TO BE STUDYING WITH HARVEY.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.412
OH...
UH-HUH.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.213
STOP THAT! THIS IS SERIOUS!

15:48.280 --> 15:49.548
CALM DOWN, SABRINA.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.550
TRY TO FIGURE OUT
EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.419
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.421
RUDY WAS CRYING.
I PICKED HIM UP.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.023
I SAID "BIG BOYS DON'T CRY"
AND I RUBBED HIS BACK.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.525
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

15:59.591 --> 16:00.659
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.194
BE A BIG BOY.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.696
YES. I SAID, "BE A BIG BOY."

16:03.762 --> 16:05.597
AND I BET YOU SAID IT
THREE TIMES.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.433
AH, MYSTERY SOLVED.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.001
YOU CAST A PASSION SPELL.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.202
WHAT'S THAT?

16:10.269 --> 16:11.704
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING ENOUGH

16:11.770 --> 16:13.572
AND SAY IT THREE TIMES,
IT MIGHT HAPPEN.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.407
WE LIKE
TO CALL IT
A "TRAVIS."

16:15.474 --> 16:16.141
WHY?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.576
RANDY TRAVIS.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.579
RANDY TRAVIS.
RANDY TRAVIS.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.449
I LOVE THIS SPELL.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.351
WH-WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.553
WE WERE ILLUSTRATING
A POINT FOR OUR NIECE.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.988
I HOPE WE HAVEN'T CAUGHT YOU
AT A BAD TIME.

16:30.055 --> 16:33.492
NO, BUT MY WIFE DOES WONDER
WHERE I KEEP POPPING OFF TO.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.160
WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ELSE?

16:35.227 --> 16:36.061
MAYBE LATER.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.464
IF YOU NEED ME...

16:38.530 --> 16:40.432
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.568
YOU ALWAYS DO.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.103
(<i> sexy growl</i> )

16:44.169 --> 16:45.571
NOW, HE IS SO CUTE!

16:45.637 --> 16:47.139
I LOVE HIS NEW ALBUM.

16:47.206 --> 16:50.008
CAN WE GET BACK TO ME?
WHAT DO I DO TO FIX THIS?

16:50.075 --> 16:52.244
EXACTLY WHAT
YOU DID BEFORE--

16:52.311 --> 16:54.580
THREE TIMES,
BUT IN REVERSE.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.715
THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.753
BOY BIG A BE.
BOY BIG A BE.
BOY BIG A BE.

17:00.819 --> 17:01.520
(<i> giggling</i> ):
IT TICKLES.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.555
NOTHING HAPPENED.
IT DIDN'T WORK.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.090
IT JUST TAKES TIME.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.126
HIS PARENTS ARE GOING
TO BE HOME SOON.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.595
Hilda:
YOU BETTER HOPE THEY
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.297
MAYBE I CAN BLAME IT
ON A RADIOACTIVE SPIDER.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.632
RUDY?

17:13.699 --> 17:16.068
WHERE'S THE BABY?!

17:17.669 --> 17:19.538
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA...

17:23.776 --> 17:25.310
IT'S ON THE HOUSE,
MR. TRAVIS.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.311
THANK YOU.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.746
DOES IT HAVE NUTS?

17:27.813 --> 17:29.715
YES, BUT YOU CAN
PICK THEM OUT.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.586
TOOKIES!

17:34.653 --> 17:36.188
HEY-HEY-HEY!

17:36.255 --> 17:37.623
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.624
MINE.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.826
MR. KAZOOTIE!

17:40.893 --> 17:45.097
YOU CAN SEE WHY
I CHANGED MY NAME.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.568
It's the bottom of the 15th.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.637
Put on a pot of java.

17:51.703 --> 17:54.473
We could be here all night.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.443
SABRINA, IS THAT YOU?

17:57.509 --> 17:58.577
YEAH.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.779
YOU ARE MISSING
A FREAKY GAME.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.652
NOW LET'S GO OVER
WHAT I TAUGHT YOU.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.687
RUDY, HOW DID YOU GET THIS WAY?

18:09.688 --> 18:10.722
GOOD.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.591
OKAY, NOW
IT'S SLEEPY TIME.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.359
WEAD ME. MOON.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.694
I'M TOO TIRED.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.862
PLAY WITH YOUR TOES.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.631
GOOD NIGHT.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.670
I COULD SURE USE A POPSI.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.839
IS THE GAME STILL ON?

18:26.905 --> 18:28.507
YEAH.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.309
MAN, IT COULD GO ON FOREVER.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.446
And it's an unassisted
triple play!

18:34.513 --> 18:35.581
It's over!

18:35.647 --> 18:37.115
WOW.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.585
SEE, NOW, THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT BASEBALL.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.320
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.121
YEAH, YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.291
WE REALLY SHOULD STUDY NOW.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.427
OKAY.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.761
MITOSIS IS...

18:49.828 --> 18:51.430
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK.
I'M WIPED.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.232
BABY-SITTING IS HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.600
SURE.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.902
I MEAN, WE COULD JUST
SIT HERE AND TALK.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.537
I'D LIKE THAT.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.507
THIS IS KIND OF NICE.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.342
YEAH.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.676
SO...

19:04.743 --> 19:05.777
SO...

19:05.844 --> 19:07.346
WE'RE HOME.

19:07.412 --> 19:08.347
MITOSIS IS...

19:08.413 --> 19:09.681
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU SO SOON.

19:09.748 --> 19:12.684
WE SKIPPED DESSERT.
I MISSED MY BABY SO MUCH.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.521
HOW MUCH DO WE OWE YOU?
FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR?

19:15.587 --> 19:18.757
UH, ACTUALLY, IT'S FIVE...
FOUR WOULD BE FINE.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.193
Carol:
JERRY, YOU'VE GOT
TO COME SEE THIS!

19:21.260 --> 19:22.928
UH, THANKS. GOT TO GO.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.770
LOOK AT OUR
SWEET LITTLE ANGEL.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.705
THEY GROW SO QUICKLY,
DON'T THEY?

19:33.772 --> 19:35.607
OH, YEAH.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.809
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT HAVING ANOTHER?

19:37.876 --> 19:39.344
NO.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.679
WE SHOULD GO NOW.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.195
I'M LOOKING FOR
A SLANTY GREEN PIECE

19:57.262 --> 19:58.597
WITH A FUNNY LITTLE WADDLE.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.599
HERE YOU GO.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.967
THANK YOU.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.803
YOU REALLY HAVE A FLAIR
FOR JIGSAW PUZZLES, RANDY.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.772
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON A BUS.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.740
THIS IS KIND OF NICE, THOUGH--

20:08.807 --> 20:11.610
POPCORN, PUZZLE,
LIGHTLY FALLING SNOW.

20:11.677 --> 20:12.611
IT'S REAL NICE.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.912
CAN I GO YET?

20:13.979 --> 20:15.781
NO.
NO.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.783
OKAY.

20:17.849 --> 20:20.352
LOOKING FOR A SKY BLUE RHOMBUS

20:20.419 --> 20:22.754
WITH A LITTLE PUFF OF CLOUDS.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.289
OH, THERE IT IS.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.427
MITOSIS IS...

20:28.493 --> 20:29.628
SALEM, I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.763
YOU WANT TO PLAY RISK?

20:31.830 --> 20:33.298
I'M SICK OF RISK.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.933
HEY, I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.002
SALEM, I THINK I HEAR
THE CAN OPENER.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.604
REALLY?

20:43.675 --> 20:45.877
EDDIE CIBRIAN. EDDIE CIBRIAN.
EDDIE CIBRIAN.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.814
UH... WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.516
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO PULL HASSELHOFF

20:51.583 --> 20:53.719
OUT OF A BURNING CORVETTE.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.887
OH, WELL, YOU CAN DO THAT LATER.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.889
UH... I WAS JUST KIND
OF WONDERING

20:57.956 --> 20:59.825
IF YOU WOULD...
TURN AROUND FOR ME.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.460
SURE.

21:03.862 --> 21:04.796
THANKS.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.398
IS THAT IT?

21:06.465 --> 21:08.734
YEAH. UNLESS YOU'RE
INTO JIGSAW PUZZLES.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.370
MY AUNTS ARE WORKING ON ONE
DOWNSTAIRS WITH RANDY TRAVIS.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.005
HMM... SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.741
WELL, GUESS HASSELHOFF
WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.609
WOW...

21:17.676 --> 21:19.678
THIS MAGIC THING ISN'T SO BAD.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.780
BRAD PITT. BRAD PITT. BRAD PITT.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.654
MITOSIS IS...

21:28.720 --> 21:29.988
MITOSIS IS...

21:30.055 --> 21:31.590
GREAT GAME,
HUH, HARVEY?

21:31.657 --> 21:33.492
YEAH, WASN'T IT FREAKY?

21:33.558 --> 21:35.560
FREAKY? YOU
WANT FREAKY?

21:35.627 --> 21:37.763
RANDY TRAVIS CAME
TO PARENTS' NIGHT.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.832
HAVE YOU MET
SABRINA'S FATHER?

21:40.899 --> 21:43.301
HE'S PRETTY
FREAKY TOO.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.070
GET BACK TO YOUR
TEST THERE.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.905
MITOSIS IS...
