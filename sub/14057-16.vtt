WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.028
Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.202 --> 00:03.828
Leaving me for a guy named George?

00:04.003 --> 00:05.869
-I'm Paul. I'm here for GEORGE.
-GEORGE?

00:06.039 --> 00:09.167
Global Environmental Organization
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.333
A guy came from GEORGE to recruit me.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.376
You have to choose
between me and GEORGE.

00:13.546 --> 00:16.071
You haven't given me the green light
on that proposal.

00:16.248 --> 00:17.910
I love you. The real you.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.915
Julie's had enough of the old Bullit.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.383
We can still play Ping-Pong.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.328
Oh, my God.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.600
Eggs.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.361
Flour. There we go.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.300
Milk.

00:39.506 --> 00:42.304
Okay, now, Ryan, fire up the griddle.

00:42.475 --> 00:45.410
And, Sandy, beat until smooth.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.045
Hey, Mama, have a seat.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.374
-ln the mood for crepes?
-You're making crepes?

00:49.549 --> 00:52.211
Yeah, Taylor sent Kaitlin
a griddle from France.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.445
With a long note about how I need
to broaden my breakfast horizons.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.385
She's 6000 miles away, still annoying.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.286
-Have you talked to her?
-Oh, no.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.826
Haven't read her blog or her scrapbook.
It's over, I'm okay.

01:02.996 --> 01:06.022
-I barely think about her.
-Even though you're living in her room?

01:06.199 --> 01:08.099
We've all had to make adjustments.

01:08.268 --> 01:11.396
Especially Kaitlin, with the entire
Cohen family taking refuge here.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.233
Oh, it's been nice.
I mean, I perfected my Sandy Cohen.

01:14.407 --> 01:18.173
Listen to this:
"I'll schmear it for you."

01:18.678 --> 01:20.475
Well, you know, not bad.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.242
I am very sexy.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.906
Baby, stop mimicking Sandy.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.746
Julie, crepe?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.552
I'm too nauseous to eat.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.121
-Morning sickness?
-Or wedding jitters. Who can tell?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.759
Your fiancÃ© is certainly excited
about the nuptials.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.761
Yeah, he's kind of become a broken record.
Over and over again, he keeps saying--

01:39.332 --> 01:40.924
-Hey, Sandy.
-Bullit.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.535
Ryan. Peanut. Hey, blondie.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.102
And there she is.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.699
The future Mrs. Gordon Bullit.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.568
Weddings days can be nerve-wracking.

01:49.742 --> 01:53.337
But just think, after tomorrow,
you will be just another old married couple.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.408
Just like that one living upstairs.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.486
Hey, breakfast time.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.356
Toaster Strudel.
Oh, you're the best cook ever.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.751
Enough talking.
What do you wanna watch?

02:08.328 --> 02:10.023
I think you know what I wanna watch.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.127
Ladies and gentlemen,
Briefcase or No Briefcase!

02:14.300 --> 02:16.825
-Premise is so simple.
-Yet so compelling.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.563
-Can I come in?
-Hey, sure.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.674
I know you don't like leaving,
but the inspector's coming today.

02:22.842 --> 02:26.039
-I think everybody should be there.
-But this chair is my home now.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.012
Downstairs in 1 0 minutes.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.415
And we waited six months for this guy?

02:31.584 --> 02:34.178
Oh, boy,
his body language is very negative.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.117
-You think?
-Wait. He just smiled.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.722
I think it was more of a smirk.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.587
-Everyone keep your fingers crossed.
-What's the good news?

02:40.760 --> 02:43.786
-When can we rebuild?
-Well, I hate to say this...

02:43.963 --> 02:45.988
-...but how about never?
-Excuse me?

02:46.166 --> 02:49.499
-The structural damage is substantial.
-But we can pay to fix it, right?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.227
Yeah, we've got insurance.

02:51.404 --> 02:55.135
The cost of repairing the damage
is more than the value of this house.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.004
I'm sorry,
but there's no saving your home.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.055 --> 03:44.455
Nice view. Infinity pool.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.119
Yeah, but no pool house.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.920
Yes, well, 6 bedrooms, I think
there's room for everyone.

03:49.095 --> 03:53.327
Yeah, but it still just doesn't feel like home.
I'm not ready to leave the old place yet.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.935
Yeah, I'll miss it. Doesn't mean
I'm not looking forward to Berkeley.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.298
Berkeley. Now, there was a house.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.565
The minute we walked in,
we knew we were home.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.606
Wood floors, exposed beams.

04:03.776 --> 04:07.007
-That house had character.
-And this house has none of those things.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.978
Well, it's got a Viking range,
granite countertops.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.413
-It's average and generic.
-I couldn't agree more.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.576
-Let's go.
-I think we should make an offer.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.982
-You do?
-You do?

04:16.154 --> 04:18.123
We've seen five versions
of the same house.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.954
-Does it really matter which one we pick?
-I'll draw up the papers.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.799
Whatever you want, honey.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.768
Take a good look around,
everything's about to change.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.002
Actually, I have a surprise.

04:39.479 --> 04:43.245
Look. The floor plan
to our apartment in Providence.

04:43.416 --> 04:47.819
Hey, big screen TV, La-Z-Boys, hot plate.
Looks exactly like here.

04:48.655 --> 04:52.614
Awesome. Do you think our TiVo
will keep its memory if we pack it?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.818
I don't know.
I should call the help line right now.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.495
What?

05:06.839 --> 05:09.364
Nothing. You know,
I think I'm gonna call later...

05:09.542 --> 05:12.102
...when there's less phone traffic
in lndia.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.569
What?

05:15.248 --> 05:18.684
Isn't it awesome we get to live like this
for the next four years?

05:18.851 --> 05:21.046
Okay, gotta run.

05:22.922 --> 05:23.911
-Hey, Atwood.
-Hey.

05:24.090 --> 05:27.184
Ryan. Come in. Sit.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.888
Yeah, not gonna happen.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.257
But I do need your help with a plan.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.594
-Does it involve leaving this room?
-lt involves leaving the city.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.497
Welcome back from Paris.
You here for business or pleasure?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.501
That is an excellent question, sir.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.835
The answer to which I spent the flight
trying to determine.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.239
Because it's not business,
but it's not pleasure.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.608
Because that would imply that
seeing Ryan Atwood again is pleasurable.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.305
When really, it's stressful.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.111
And really surreal
that we ever dated in the first place.

05:53.286 --> 05:57.086
It's not like we have anything in common.
Not that we didn't try, because we did.

05:57.256 --> 06:00.885
I stopped wearing shoes and learned
Hacky Sack to fit in at Berkeley.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.494
Then he learned French
and learned the difference...

06:03.663 --> 06:05.324
...between a Brie and a Camembert.

06:05.498 --> 06:09.059
Then he grew this little mustache
in an effort to appear more French-like...

06:09.235 --> 06:12.466
...but he's fair-haired, and it was
kind of an above-lip disaster.

06:12.638 --> 06:16.005
And from there we just realized
it didn't work. You know, we didn't work.

06:16.175 --> 06:20.635
And I left to escape the painful reality
of yet another failed relationship.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.145
And at least this time
I didn't stalk him, though.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.113
Because sometimes I do that.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.912
Good thing I never fell in love
with the president, huh?

06:28.087 --> 06:31.648
-That would be bad.
-Right.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.165
-Summer.
-Hey, Taylor.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.495
-Hey.
-Hey. It's so good to see you.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.136
You too.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.635
Did you come alone?

06:47.306 --> 06:49.433
Ryan doesn't know that you're coming.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.635
-You told me not to tell him.
-Who said anything about Ryan?

06:52.812 --> 06:56.179
We're so over. I just--
I can't even believe we ever even dated.

06:56.349 --> 07:00.046
I don't even think I would recognize him.
I just hope he shaved that mustache--

07:00.219 --> 07:03.188
-Did you get the rental car?
-Yeah. You got the address?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.451
Ryan.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.097
You found out I was coming
and decided to surprise me?

07:12.265 --> 07:16.292
No, I didn't know you were coming back.
And I'm leaving.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.493
Now I'm surprised.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.696
-Where are you guys going?
-Oh, not far. We'll be back by tonight.

07:20.873 --> 07:24.536
-Yeah, it's a mission. I'm gonna call you.
-Okay, well, brilliant catching up.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.234
It's good to see you.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.349
-That wasn't awkward at all.
-No, no. Why would it be?

07:31.517 --> 07:34.111
It's not like I'm still in love with her
or anything.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.684
Taylor, are you okay?

07:38.858 --> 07:42.089
No, I'm not.
I'm still in love with him.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.491
I can't believe the Bullit's got 1 2 sons.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.132
One from every major oil refinery
in Texas.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.064
I've always wanted brothers,
and now I'm gonna have a dozen.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.727
I mean, it'll be cool,
if they're all like you.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.465
Well, that's the thing.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.735
Oh, there she is.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.743
Bullits, meet the squirt.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.973
-Hi there, squirt!
-Squirt, meet the Bullits.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.641
This is Austin, Dallas, Houston...

08:06.819 --> 08:09.310
...Lubbock, Odessa, El Paso, Amarillo...

08:09.489 --> 08:12.014
...Texarkana, San Antonio,
Corpus Christi...

08:12.191 --> 08:14.182
...and Hanoi.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.553
-Okay.
-Ain't that something?

08:18.731 --> 08:22.497
Now you got yourself a whole buffet
of Bullits to love.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.004
Well, I guess the apple
really doesn't fall far from the tree.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.870
Oh, not my apples.
The Bullit's DNA is bulletproof.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.102
Not a recessive gene
in the whole damn double helix.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.215
Oh, lookie here, the wife-to-be.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.442
What's the word, sweetie?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.852
It's a boy.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.221
Lucky number 1 3. Yes!

08:53.533 --> 08:56.127
-This is it.
-The Berkeley house.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.264
Exactly how Sandy described it.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.268
You ready for this?

09:06.779 --> 09:09.373
-Hello.
-Hi.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.483
So we'd like to buy your house.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.661
Don't shut the door,
we'd like to buy your house.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.631
And you're an adorable couple,
but this house isn't for sale.

09:30.803 --> 09:34.068
-We should tell them everything.
-Okay. Right. This is my house.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.401
-Shut the door.
-No, it used to be his house.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.841
Yeah. Those baby handprints
in the cement, those are mine.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.105
Those hands are yours?
Those are so cute.

09:42.281 --> 09:43.771
I know. Thank you.

09:43.950 --> 09:48.114
My parents moved us to Newport when l
was 2, which was a mistake on many levels.

09:48.287 --> 09:51.450
But it did allow us to adopt
a young ex-convict named Ryan.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.524
-Shut the door.
-I'm not a convict.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.957
Now our house is condemned
due to an earthquake.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.493
My mom's about to have a baby.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.598
I feel there's this chance
for our family to have a fresh start.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.360
His parents always talk about
the time they spent here...

10:03.536 --> 10:06.562
-...being the best of their lives.
-lt'd be like coming home.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.967
Look, I hear you.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.836
But this already is a home.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.502
It's ours, and it's not for sale.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.649
I thought I had them.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.808
-Me too.
-We should call your dad.

10:19.986 --> 10:23.615
Sure, no one can change somebody's mind
like Dad, but he's not gonna leave Mom.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.225
And the airlines won't let women fly
in their ninth month of pregnancy.

10:27.393 --> 10:30.191
What if she didn't fly on an airline?

10:32.264 --> 10:35.427
And you also sign here and here.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.832
And this is your offer.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.869
We'll live there for a year,
get settled with the baby...

10:46.045 --> 10:48.741
...and then we can look for a house
without feeling rushed.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.678
I know we can't impose on Julie
much longer. I just wish....

10:51.851 --> 10:53.250
Oh, me too.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.114
But wherever our family is...

10:55.287 --> 10:56.515
...that's home.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.856
Drop that pen, amigo.

11:03.029 --> 11:06.362
I'm kidnapping the both of you.
Come on. The jet is gassed up.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.397
-ls he drunk?
-No, your boys called.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.161
They're in Berkeley
trying to buy back the old homestead.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.237
Just need you two there to seal the deal.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.567
I figured the least I could do
is lend my jet...

11:15.741 --> 11:18.437
...since old Sanford here
introduced me to my lady love.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.238
I can't fly, I'm 9 months pregnant.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.940
Amarillo is waiting at the plane.
He's a doctor for women's private parts.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.210
-Come on, sunshine's burning. Let's go.
-Not to pressure you...

11:27.386 --> 11:29.911
...but the owners
are expecting other offers.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.717
What the hell, blondie,
I'll buy this house.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.861
There you go. There you go.
Thank you.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.456
I'm not saying things will snap back
to how they were...

11:39.632 --> 11:41.532
...but maybe we were too quick
to give up.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.862
So we'll be 6000 miles away.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.436
I'll be in Newport for Christmas
and the summer.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.130
We'll make it work.
I should call him, don't you think?

11:49.308 --> 11:53.210
-Real-life Jake broke up with real-life April.
-What are you doing?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.075
I told Seth I wouldn't watch TV
till he got home.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.808
-So I'm reading about The Valley.
-That show's still on?

11:58.984 --> 12:02.385
Got picked up for five more seasons.
These teen dramas, they run forever.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.250
-Okay, enough. This is insane.
-Hey!

12:04.423 --> 12:06.914
When I left, you were
a committed environmentalist.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.457
You were passionate.

12:08.627 --> 12:11.460
You engaged with the world. You bathed.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.154
-I still care about things.
-Like?

12:13.332 --> 12:17.393
Besides Briefcase or No Briefcase
and the stars of The Valley.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.200
Sweetie, tell me what happened.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.603
I don't know.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.837
Well, the earthquake happened
and the comic-book store closed down.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.605
And Seth's room was destroyed.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.909
I didn't join GEORGE,
and then he moved in.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.416
We talked about everything
there was to talk about.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.283
And one day, we turned on the TV,
and there it was:

12:37.456 --> 12:39.651
Briefcase or No Briefcase.

12:39.825 --> 12:43.192
Suddenly, we weren't worried about
the future or wondering who we were.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.455
For the first time,
we were really comfortable.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.896
Maybe a little too comfortable.
You ever think about that?

12:49.068 --> 12:50.626
No.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.862
Oh, my God, what is that?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.833
I don't know.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.178
Pancakes had babies.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.871
When did this happen?

13:03.048 --> 13:06.040
-You didn't know she was pregnant?
-I didn't know he was a she.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.347
Oh, my God. I'm a bad crack mother.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.955
Shouldn't we wait at the house?

13:11.123 --> 13:14.559
We got a little time till the Bullit
is wheels down with the parents.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.194
Take a look around, man.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.956
In a few weeks, you'll have
all these new faces to punch.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.895
-You getting nostalgic on me?
-Seriously, everyone's moving.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.762
Newport's over. This is the future.

13:23.936 --> 13:28.498
And it's also possible you may meet
another Taylor Townsend. What was that?

13:28.674 --> 13:31.939
There is no other Taylor? There's only one
and you're in love with her?

13:32.111 --> 13:34.341
You haven't said a word
since we bumped into her.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.674
Which means
you can't stop thinking about her.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.010
-I'll get some coffee.
-You love her, I know it.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.948
-Stop it.
-I know it.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.214
Join GEORGE. Fight the industrial
devastation of our planet.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.383
-Hey, are you Paul from GEORGE?
-No. Tom from GEORGE. You know Paul?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.654
No, my girlfriend,
Summer Roberts, met him.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.526
Yeah, Paul was really disappointed
when she turned us down.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.257
What's she up to now?

13:56.168 --> 13:59.001
-Not much of anything, really.
-Well...

13:59.171 --> 14:00.695
...give her this, would you?

14:00.873 --> 14:04.001
I hate to see someone like Summer
just waste their passion.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.643
Yeah.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.379
She loves the otters.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.514
Here you go.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.723
-Hello?
-Ryan, hi. It's me.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.990
This soap stings.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.598
Well, that's because it's lye.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.564
Sorry. So I was thinking...

14:30.736 --> 14:34.832
...maybe we should get together
and talk about things.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.236
What? You don't want to?

14:37.409 --> 14:40.901
No, it's just I don't know when Seth and l
are gonna get back from Berkeley.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.241
Oh, why are you in Berkeley?

14:43.415 --> 14:47.852
Long story, but basically trying to get
the Cohens their old house back.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.579
-The Cohens are moving to Berkeley?
-lf things work out.

14:52.358 --> 14:57.796
So that would mean you wouldn't be
coming back to Newport for Christmas...

14:57.963 --> 15:00.090
...or summer...

15:00.266 --> 15:03.394
-...or ever.
-Guess not.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.436
Listen, we could talk after the wedding
if you want.

15:06.605 --> 15:09.369
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I have to go.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.566
You have a nice trip.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.121
We finish this, and then we're done.
Unless there's anything else you need.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.725
I'm all good.
I've got my shoes, my dress.

15:27.893 --> 15:30.657
My cheat sheet with the names
of all my stepbrothers.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.592
How was that, meeting all of them?

15:33.032 --> 15:35.626
A little weird.
I mean, I love Bullit.

15:35.801 --> 15:39.362
-But one's kind of enough, you know.
-You're telling me.

15:39.538 --> 15:42.803
What are you talking about?
You're about to spawn off the latest.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.500
Well, maybe he won't be
all that Bullitesque.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.509
Don't count on it. He'll come out...

15:47.680 --> 15:50.649
...with a cowboy hat
telling the doctor:

15:50.816 --> 15:52.044
Or a wife-beater.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.882
Why would he be wearing a wife beat--?

15:57.923 --> 16:01.324
-Oh, my God, Mom--
-Okay, honey, just relax.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.960
You have to be kidding me.

16:03.128 --> 16:07.155
-I mean, does the Bullit know?
-Of course he knows.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.030
-Wait, you told him that the baby is--?
-Frank's. Yes.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.530
And when were you gonna tell me?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.503
Soon.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.569
I'm sorry. This isn't easy.

16:19.178 --> 16:22.011
Well, what happened
with you and Frank?

16:22.181 --> 16:23.409
I got pregnant...

16:23.582 --> 16:26.915
...and Frank couldn't deal with it,
so I left him.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.417
That's when Bullit came back.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.988
I told him everything,
and he still wanted to marry me.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.784
That's the whole story.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.257
Mom, do you love the Bullit?

16:38.764 --> 16:40.391
Yes.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.502
I can't believe we're here.
Seriously, fellas, this is crazy.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.339
-You said it's where you were the happiest.
-Every city needs public defenders.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.641
Plus, I think my little sister deserves a shot
at growing up normal.

16:57.816 --> 17:01.377
-Well, we can at least talk to them.
-Can't hurt.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.055
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.460
I'm Sandy Cohen, this is my wife,
Kirsten, and we used to live here.

17:13.766 --> 17:14.993
-I'm Todd.
-Patrick.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.829
And, yeah, your sons
already told us everything...

17:18.002 --> 17:20.164
...about the earthquake,
hands in the cement.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.739
-But like we said--
-You don't wanna sell, I get it.

17:22.907 --> 17:26.173
But just being here again,
I gotta say, it still feels like home.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.745
Is the bathroom still in the same place?
Do you mind?

17:29.181 --> 17:31.775
-Why would I mind?
-Thank you.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.210
I love what you've done
with the decorating.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.048
Any chance we could see the kitchen?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.055
Just to see if the Seth growth chart
is still on the wall?

17:40.225 --> 17:43.058
It isn't. We thought it was termites.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.755
I hit 3 feet. I mean,
it was a pretty huge accomplishment.

17:46.932 --> 17:50.732
Sir, while we appreciate your nostalgia,
we have things to do--

17:50.903 --> 17:53.064
It's all right,
we'll be out in just a sec.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.865
Sandy?

17:55.174 --> 17:57.074
-Or not.
-Sandy!

17:58.944 --> 18:02.038
-I'm here.
-Oh, my God.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.613
Okay, this isn't the bathroom.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.409
I'm sorry, I didn't make it.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.442
My water broke.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.452
-Seth, call an ambulance.
-There's no time for an ambulance.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.681
Okay, this is so random,
but I'm a midwife.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.520
Good, because this baby's coming now.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.500
Sophie Rose Cohen.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.505
-It's got a nice ring to it, huh?
-She's beautiful, isn't she?

18:29.675 --> 18:33.008
She will be in two years when
she doesn't look like a squished meatball.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.476
You just called your sister
a squished meatball.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.547
You should have seen
what you looked like.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.480
-Oh, he was beautiful too.
-Yeah, I was.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.620
You looked like you went 1 2 rounds...

18:42.788 --> 18:45.382
-...with Joe Frazier.
-It's time for a feeding.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.957
-Oh, she's gonna--
-Yeah, we should go.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.886
No, thank you, Kirsten,
I'm lactose intolerant.

18:52.064 --> 18:55.124
What are you doing here?
Aren't you getting married in a few hours?

18:55.300 --> 18:59.498
I know. Couldn't get any damn airspace.
Those dot-commers up here with their jets.

18:59.671 --> 19:02.538
Runway was busier than a bull
in springtime. It's fine now.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.336
Hey, thanks for everything.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.503
Give Julie our best. And please explain
why we couldn't make it.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.511
Oh, I will. And she'll be thrilled.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.583
And when she pops out
lucky number 1 3...

19:13.752 --> 19:15.743
...I want you there.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.320
Sophie Rose Cohen.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.425
Kaitlin, what are you doing here?

19:29.601 --> 19:33.367
Wondering if you got an invite
to the wedding, because you didn't RSVP...

19:33.539 --> 19:37.839
...which is really rude, considering
my mom's pregnant with your baby.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.937
-So she told you, huh?
-How could you do that?

19:41.113 --> 19:43.513
Just walk away from her?
I mean, she loved you.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.343
When she told me she was pregnant...

19:45.517 --> 19:47.849
...I did kind of panic,
and I know I let her down.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.512
When I went to see her and tell her that,
she was having dinner with Bullit.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.091
For what it's worth, I really do love her,
but she's made her choice.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.586
I know better than to try
to change her mind.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.788
-So you're just quitting?
-No, wait a minute.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.901
-lsn't this what you wanted?
-All I want is for my mom to be happy...

20:04.069 --> 20:06.037
...and for my brother
to have his dad around.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.435
But not if he's gonna be a coward.

20:12.344 --> 20:16.075
You know,
I thought Atwoods were good at fighting.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.114
-Hey. Is Mom sleeping?
-Hey.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.226
Mother and daughter
are snoring soundly.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.725
How you feeling?

20:32.297 --> 20:34.765
Like I landed in a time warp.

20:34.933 --> 20:38.369
Your mother, me, a new baby,
this house.

20:38.537 --> 20:41.597
It's almost 20 years later,
I feel like no time has passed at all.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.867
Well, you look like it too.
You got that full head of hair.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.274
If I look half as good as you in 20 years,
I'll be a happy man.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.938
Thanks, but I'd like to see you
being happy right now.

20:51.116 --> 20:54.108
Seems the last couple of months,
you've landed in a bit of a rut.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.514
Or at least a La-Z-Boy.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.382
Well, I sort of have...

20:57.556 --> 21:01.515
...but being up here
and seeing Ryan's new life...

21:01.893 --> 21:03.690
...meeting my new sister...

21:03.862 --> 21:06.763
...I get that change is happening
whether I want it to or not.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.297
Nothing lasts forever.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.867
But you and Summer
still have each other.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.834
You'll be heading off
to Providence together.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.473
Yeah.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.309
Except I'm not so sure
that us being together...

21:18.477 --> 21:21.708
...is bringing out the best
in either one of us right now.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.977
But I'm afraid to let her go, so....

21:27.853 --> 21:31.983
Well, things have a way
of coming back around.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.191
I mean, look at us.

21:48.373 --> 21:51.638
Hey, maybe I should go try to find Julie
and see if she needs any help.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.075
Sure, Summer, just abandon me too.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.080
Maybe I'll strike up a casual romance
with one of the Bullits.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.583
Okay, who do you think is hotter,
El Paso or San Antonio?

22:03.522 --> 22:05.854
Yeah, I'm gonna have to think
about that.

22:06.858 --> 22:09.258
Hanoi has a certain charm.

22:11.797 --> 22:13.765
Thanks for filling in for Kirsten.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.560
I hope she shows up soon.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.532
-You look so beautiful.
-Thank you.

22:19.705 --> 22:23.266
And you,
it's nice to see you looking so...

22:23.442 --> 22:24.466
...showered again.

22:24.943 --> 22:28.310
-Well, I figured it was about time.
-Yeah.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.940
Is everything okay?

22:32.417 --> 22:34.282
I guess.

22:35.420 --> 22:38.912
I don't know, you're with
the same someone for so long...

22:39.091 --> 22:42.254
...I guess you start to get
a little comfortable.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.190
I wouldn't know.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.561
Do you think that Seth and l
are making a mistake?

22:47.733 --> 22:49.758
Living together right after
the earthquake...

22:49.935 --> 22:52.904
...and then getting
an apartment together?

22:53.505 --> 22:58.533
Well, you know,
I got married so young...

22:58.710 --> 23:01.679
...that I never had a chance
to find out who I was...

23:01.847 --> 23:04.281
...or what I cared about.

23:04.449 --> 23:08.283
I mean, I never went to college
or learned any real skills.

23:08.453 --> 23:13.891
And now, here I am, 20 years later,
still knocked up on my wedding day.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.458
Julie.

23:15.627 --> 23:19.324
Summer, you're a great girl.

23:19.498 --> 23:22.228
And the world deserves to know you.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.794
You deserve it too.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.665
Don't settle for comfortable.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.634
I got you something.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.195
I know she would have wanted
to be here today.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.498
Thank you.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.198
Thank you.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.533
Crap, my makeup.

24:00.972 --> 24:02.496
My makeup.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.505
It'll take hours to fix.

24:04.676 --> 24:08.544
Hours? We don't got hours.
We're getting married now.

24:08.713 --> 24:11.307
Now? Is Kirsten here?

24:11.483 --> 24:14.043
About that,
she dropped child up in San Fran.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.983
But lucky for her
there was a hell of a midwife standing by.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.383
Kirsten had her baby?

24:18.557 --> 24:20.821
Yeah, she said she was sorry
she couldn't be here.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.051
Now, are you ready to get hitched?

24:23.695 --> 24:26.459
I can't get married without Kiki.
She's my best friend.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.622
I'm sorry,
but I'm not doing it without her.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.644
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.270
One of you two wouldn't be
a wedding planner, would you?

24:45.116 --> 24:46.947
Actually....

24:50.522 --> 24:52.854
Let me see my flower girl.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.685
-Julie?
-Are you a runaway bride?

24:54.860 --> 24:56.657
Kind of a runaway wedding.

24:57.229 --> 25:01.290
Wait a minute, does that mean
that everybody came with you?

25:03.668 --> 25:06.068
-Can I talk to you?
-Do you have a minute?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.868
Okay, Ryan,
what do you wanna talk about?

25:11.443 --> 25:14.344
I realized that when I talked
to you yesterday on the phone...

25:14.513 --> 25:17.346
-...I may have been a little insensitive.
-You? Never.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.509
I also realized that if the Cohens do move
to Berkeley, we--

25:21.686 --> 25:23.950
We may never see each other again.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.783
Hadn't really thought about it.

25:27.692 --> 25:31.355
And when we do say goodbye,
I wanted it to be as friends.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.589
Friends.

25:33.999 --> 25:38.265
Sure. Ryan Atwood, mon ami.
Sounds terrif.

25:51.116 --> 25:53.346
-I'll sew those back on for you.
-Yeah. Okay.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.386
Okay.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.926
What is it with you people?

26:06.164 --> 26:08.223
We're grandparents?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.493
Wow, that's--

26:10.669 --> 26:13.729
That's amazing.
Congratulations to the Pancakes.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.338
Yeah.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.442
Don't you think it's weird
we didn't know Pancakes was pregnant?

26:18.610 --> 26:22.046
Well, we're not gonna win
any parenting awards.

26:22.213 --> 26:26.309
I mean, we must have been pretty out of it
to not even notice or care.

26:27.719 --> 26:31.314
-I think we've been in kind of a--
-Rut lately? Yeah.

26:32.691 --> 26:37.685
Do you really think that we can spend
the next four years like this?

26:39.297 --> 26:43.028
Well, look, I'm a pretty skeptical guy.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.759
I don't really believe in signs...

26:46.338 --> 26:49.000
...but this one's pretty easy to read.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.133
It's very easy to read.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.835
-It's big letters.
-GEORGE?

26:55.013 --> 26:56.605
You gotta go, Summer.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.115
-But what about us?
-This is for us, okay?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.813
It's for both of us.

27:14.532 --> 27:17.660
I, Julie Cooper, take you, Gordon Bullit....

27:17.836 --> 27:22.500
I, Julie Cooper, take you, Gordon Bullit....

27:40.158 --> 27:42.422
Julie!

27:48.066 --> 27:51.058
Now, by the power vested in me
by the st--

27:52.203 --> 27:54.728
Oh, come on, squirt.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.234
-Frank?
-Frank?

27:58.476 --> 28:00.444
-Hello?
-Kaitlin, hey, is your mom around?

28:00.612 --> 28:03.308
-Yeah, she's getting married.
-That's what I was afraid of.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.644
-Put me on speaker phone.
-Took you long enough.

28:07.252 --> 28:09.618
Julie? Julie, can you hear me?

28:09.788 --> 28:11.915
-Frank, what are you doing?
-I love you, Julie.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.854
I wanna be there for you and our son.

28:16.828 --> 28:21.162
-She's pregnant with Frank's baby?
-Who cares? This is so romantic.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.757
-Hello?
-Sorry, Frank, old buddy.

28:23.935 --> 28:26.460
We're having a hard time hearing you.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.937
Let's get on with the wedding.

28:32.744 --> 28:36.009
I'm sorry, can I have a moment?

28:42.921 --> 28:46.687
Oh, that woman is like nailing Jell-O
to the wall.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.899
-Mom.
-Not now, Kaitlin.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.729
Mom's trying to figure out who to marry.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.598
I know.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.536
Which is why whatever you decide...

29:03.708 --> 29:06.176
...just make sure it's what you want.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.543
Because this is forever.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.796
Okay.

29:28.399 --> 29:32.165
So Todd and I were talking and--

29:32.570 --> 29:34.504
You had a baby here.
You had a wedding.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.469
Christened one of our bedrooms.

29:36.641 --> 29:38.472
Clearly, you have a connection.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.308
This is your house.
We're just living in it.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.278
-We'll have our lawyers call you, but--
-We can't fight fate.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.111
We'll sell.

29:49.387 --> 29:50.615
You mean it?

29:53.391 --> 29:55.120
Thank you.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.788
-You in?
-Yeah.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.265
The Cohens are moving to Berkeley.

30:06.437 --> 30:08.564
Sophie, you're home.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.210
Hey, sweetie.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.315
You made up your mind?

30:37.769 --> 30:39.361
What are we gonna do?

30:39.537 --> 30:41.630
We got a lot of work to do.

30:41.806 --> 30:44.366
Our kitchen is gonna be so empty.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.875
I know. I was kind of getting used
to becoming a Cohen.

30:48.046 --> 30:51.072
My Sandy imitation was killer.

30:51.916 --> 30:54.316
Well, it's just the two of us now.

30:54.886 --> 30:57.684
It's pretty awesome
that you decided to stay single.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.347
But do we have a plan?

31:00.525 --> 31:03.983
Yeah. I was thinking we could go
get mani-pedis, maybe a couple of mystics.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.460
I was talking about, like, a real plan.

31:06.631 --> 31:09.930
-A life plan.
-I know.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.199
The truth is, I don't.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.636
For the first time, I am going to figure out
how to do this on my own.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.105
You're not on your own.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.443
I could work retail.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.842
Part-time, at least.

31:23.314 --> 31:26.306
-We'll figure it out.
-We're Coopers.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.781
Oh, hey. Summer forgot her books.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.089
"Undergraduate catalog."

32:06.591 --> 32:08.422
All right, Roberts.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.322
-I'll see you.
-All right, Atwood.

32:10.495 --> 32:13.862
And thank you very much for Flapjacks.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.499
I promise I'll raise him right.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.191
Don't forget to clean his cage...

32:17.368 --> 32:19.529
-...which shouldn't be for cage fights.
-Got it.

32:19.704 --> 32:22.798
-I'm gonna miss you so much.
-I know.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.001
You can follow up
with my political efforts on my blog.

32:26.177 --> 32:29.271
And you can follow my personal efforts
on mine.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.676
You're the best.
You're the only girlfriend I ever had.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.615
-I'll miss you.
-You too.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.053
All right, we'll be in the car.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.059
I don't know.

32:48.232 --> 32:52.566
Some of these GEORGE guys,
they look so idealistic.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.772
You got nothing to worry about.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.641
Just remember, this isn't goodbye.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.035
You're my destiny, Cohen.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.943
Go save the world, Summer Roberts.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.730
See you in '08
after the New Hampshire primary.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.261
Just go.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.932
I'm gonna go.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.784
Bye.

34:28.399 --> 34:32.096
So you're going off to Berkeley,
I am going off to Paris.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.465
Who knows what's gonna happen, huh?

34:35.172 --> 34:37.402
Yeah. Well, I think
what's really important...

34:37.574 --> 34:40.100
...is what's already happened,
which was this year.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.109
Thank you, Taylor.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.838
You saved me.

34:44.014 --> 34:48.543
Oh, well, you may have helped me
iron out a few issues of my own.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.112
All right. Come here.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.958
All aboard.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.628
Remind me why you're taking
the train to Paris.

35:01.799 --> 35:05.200
I'm taking a train to New York,
and from there I'm taking a boat to Paris.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.861
It's the strangest thing,
but no airline would have me.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.736
Oh, you better get going.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.672
Oh, yeah, but--

35:13.845 --> 35:15.745
-Ryan.
-I better do that.

35:16.314 --> 35:17.542
Ryan?

35:17.715 --> 35:20.411
They're not gonna let you off the train.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.980
-Where's the next station?
-San Bernardino, I think.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.717
-It's an hour away.
-We can do a lot in an hour.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.718
I did book a sleeper car.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.708
That's the last of it.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.715
There you go.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.290
Fly safe and we'll see you
at Parents Day weekend.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.586
-All right.
-Two months and 1 4 days away.

36:03.761 --> 36:06.286
-I'll be counting the days as well.
-Oh, I love you.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.261
Oh, I love you too. Let's group-hug it.

36:08.432 --> 36:09.831
All right.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.969
Well, I guess we better get going
if we're gonna beat the traffic.

36:19.143 --> 36:22.601
You take care of yourself, okay?

36:24.482 --> 36:26.643
You got the directions
in case we get separated?

36:26.817 --> 36:29.650
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm just gonna hang out.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.981
As much as this house meant to you....

36:32.423 --> 36:35.483
Take your time. I'll meet you
at the rest stop in Santa Barbara.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.855
-All right.
-Time to go.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.587
Yup.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.839
-I can give you a ride.
-No, no, this is better.

37:00.017 --> 37:01.416
My new life of loneliness...

37:01.586 --> 37:03.679
-...and isolation begins now.
-You'll be fine.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.948
I don't know about you, though.
I've been checking on your new roommate.

37:07.124 --> 37:09.957
His favorite book and movie
are Da Vinci Code.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.652
-He's no me.
-You say that like it's a bad thing.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.628
At least I leave you funnier
than when I found you.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.268
I'm a lot better off
than when you found me.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.432
Me too.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.839
-Should we hug? I know, that's crazy.
-Come on.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.876
-Give me a shake, dude.
-Okay.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.982
-All right.
-All right.

37:32.383 --> 37:33.680
Oh, feels good in here.

37:33.851 --> 37:35.341
Oh, it felt really nice.

37:35.519 --> 37:36.747
Felt really nice.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.889
-Yeah.
-All right.

37:39.056 --> 37:41.183
-See you later.
-Yeah.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.257
I don't know what to say...

38:21.432 --> 38:25.698
...except that you totally had my back
out there.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.559
Hey.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.471
Ryan 's gonna stay with us now.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.149
I'll unpack later.

40:31.662 --> 40:34.688
Good job, you guys. Louder, come on.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.208
All right.

40:51.715 --> 40:55.344
I think you can pretty much imagine
what I'm gonna talk about.

40:56.086 --> 40:59.078
-Law?
-That's right. That's right.

40:59.256 --> 41:01.520
I hope you know what I'm talking about.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.521
All right.

41:05.129 --> 41:08.656
Any volunteers? Yes?

41:10.301 --> 41:13.702
-Miss Cooper.
-X equals 24.

41:55.746 --> 41:56.974
Thanks.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.424
Yeah, I'm just leaving the site now.

42:13.597 --> 42:14.962
Everything looks good.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.327
We're on schedule
to meet our target date.

42:17.501 --> 42:18.934
Thank you.

42:44.628 --> 42:46.425
Hey, kid.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.364
Need any help?
