(THOR LAUGHING)

00:04.638 --> 00:06.171
Watch your repost, Volstagg.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.574
Your right flank should never
be unprotected.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.810
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:11.812 --> 00:14.713
Unprotected flank?
I think not!

00:14.715 --> 00:17.049
Seems you are
going soft, Thor.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.151
Too much time with your
earthling playmates.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.020
(GRUNTS)

00:21.022 --> 00:22.454
Ha!

00:22.456 --> 00:24.590
My time on Earth
only strengthens me!

00:25.025 --> 00:26.392
(GROANS)

00:27.694 --> 00:29.828
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:29.830 --> 00:32.531
Earth is a realm
of endless creativity.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.700
Watch that flank.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.968
(GRUNTS)

00:35.970 --> 00:39.405
(LAUGHS) You'll answer
for that one, my friend.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.173
(BEEPS)
Excuse me, Volstagg.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.875
(YELLING)

00:42.877 --> 00:45.244
Mmm-hmm.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.845
(EXHALES)
Right.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.380
An Avengers matter
has come up.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.215
We will have to finish
this match later.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.650
Heimdall!

00:54.354 --> 00:56.655
I will win this bout
when he gets back.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.192
Until then,
back to the training table.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.427
Mmm.

01:05.532 --> 01:09.268
Hmm. Strange place
for an Avengers emergency.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.104
It gets stranger.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.873
Iron Man, Captain America,
and Falcon.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.176
What is so special
about this town?

01:17.178 --> 01:21.447
Nothing. That is, nothing
if we could see the town.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.084
(GRUNTS)

01:25.086 --> 01:26.618
Is this all that's coming?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.287
It's just us, Hulk.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.390
Hawkeye and Black Widow
are on a secret
S.H.I.E.L.D. op.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.126
So you dragged us up here
to look at fog.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.528
Huh. That's great.

01:36.530 --> 01:40.099
FALCON: The distress call
went out before the town
disappeared from sight.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.268
And if you noticed,
the area around is untouched.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.571
I noticed.
So what's in there?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.139
Wish we knew.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.641
Even my lights can't cut
through that fog.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.110
HULK: No problem.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.312
One Hulk-sized clap
will clear it out.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.048
(INHALES)
And shatter windows,
and possibly

01:56.050 --> 01:58.217
bring houses down
on helpless people.

01:58.219 --> 02:02.321
Allow me. I'll send this fog
to the Realm Below.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.989
Sure.
Do it the hard way.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.059
(WIND GUSTING)

02:10.163 --> 02:12.764
And cue the grateful populace.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.100

02:15.102 --> 02:16.735
All in a day's work, folks.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.270
I don't think
they're running to us.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.938
They're running away.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.307
(RESIDENTS SCREAMING)

02:22.309 --> 02:23.342

away from what?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.977
From those things.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.379
(GRUNTING)

02:28.848 --> 02:31.850
Save us from those...
Whatever they are.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.620
Easy, easy.
We don't have to fight.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.022
(GROWLING)

02:37.024 --> 02:39.258
(ROARS)

02:39.260 --> 02:41.226
Okay.
Now we have to fight.

Advertise your product or brand here

we mean business.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.611
(GRUNTING)

02:59.613 --> 03:01.947
These things look confused
and scared.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.215
There's nothing
to worry about.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.683
The Avengers are here.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.153
Now, tell me what happened.
(GASPS)

03:08.155 --> 03:09.288
Or don't.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.857
As if the day
wasn't weird enough.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.528
Avengers, stand aside.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.366
(CREATURES GROANING)

03:25.305 --> 03:29.341
Do not interfere.
This only concerns Inhumans.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
Inhumans?
I know 'em.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.312
Super people with attitude.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.047
They don't play well
with others.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.748
Gorgon.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.217
Karnak.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.219
(GROWLS)
Lockjaw.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.920
Medusa.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.322
And Black Bolt.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.692
Hulk, the creatures you fight
are workers of Attilan,

03:46.694 --> 03:48.894
escaped beings
of our creation.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.463
We will contain them
and be on our way.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.232
(GRUNTS)

03:54.200 --> 03:56.468
(GRUNTING)

04:02.342 --> 04:03.742
It would seem
you are the leader.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.778
Not just our leader.
He is Black Bolt,

04:06.780 --> 04:09.548
King of the Royal Family
of Attilan.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.517
Show due respect, human.

04:12.519 --> 04:16.288
Ha! Human.
That is amusing.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.055
(LAUGHS)

04:18.058 --> 04:19.858
Thor, son of Odin,

04:19.860 --> 04:21.927
ruler of Asgard.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.364
At your service,
Black Bolt.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.033
Hmm.
You will
forgive Black Bolt

04:28.035 --> 04:29.801
for not speaking,
Lord of Asgard.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.970
For everything you are
with your hammer,

04:31.972 --> 04:34.106
Black Bolt is
with his voice.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.875
Hmm, then I respect
the power of his silence.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.411
A thousand pardons,
Black Bolt.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.148
I accept full responsibility
for the crash, My Lord.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.384
Crash?
This is the Seeker.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.287
A transport ship under
his command lost power

04:48.289 --> 04:50.122
and crashed near here.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.291
It carried
experimental materials.

04:52.293 --> 04:56.128
Mostly Alpha Primitives
and our Terrigen Mists.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.096
You were just cruising
upstate New York

04:58.098 --> 05:00.899
with a flying saucer
full of horror movie stuff?

05:00.901 --> 05:03.902
Science is the keystone
of Inhuman life.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.504
As inhabitants of Earth,

05:05.506 --> 05:08.974
we also have the right
to study it, as you do.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.909
The Alpha Primitives
are clones

05:10.911 --> 05:13.245
created to assist us
in our lab work.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.613
They frighten easily.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.316
But they are never
this aggressive.
(GRUNTING)

05:17.318 --> 05:19.351
And what are Terrigen Mists?

05:19.353 --> 05:22.421
It's the gunk that gives
Inhumans their powers.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.290
Doesn't work on humans,
or Hulks.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.993
Seems we can help each other
out if we join forces.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.862
You can see to the
cowering humans
if you must,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.532
but the welfare
of the Alpha Primitives
is our business.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.472
Perhaps it is best
we stay out of their way.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.008
My sensors got a reading
on the Terrigen Mist.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.976
It's definitely
the source of the fog,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.813
but it's mixed with some
chemical I can't ID.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.016
FALCON: Mystery chemical
might be what's driving
the clones into a frenzy.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.318
SEEKER: Contaminated
Terrigen could indeed

05:53.320 --> 05:55.721
be responsible for the
Alpha Primitives' behavior.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.390
Watch out, pup.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.792
A concentrated sample
of Terrigen crystal

06:00.794 --> 06:03.328
would certainly calm down
the Primitives.

06:03.330 --> 06:07.032
If I weren't needed here,
I could return to Attilan
and get some.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.800
I know my way
around Attilan.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.702
I can get it.
Come here, pup.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.405
You and me gotta
make a run home.
(BARKS)

06:13.407 --> 06:17.008
It is of the utmost
necessity, My Lord.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.710
You call the dog
"My Lord"?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.212
He is royalty.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.013
By what other name
would you address him?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.548
I don't know. Rover?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.550
(GROWLS)

06:26.185 --> 06:27.686
Take this key.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.489
It grants you permission
to venture anywhere
within Attilan.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.725
Back before you know it.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.227
Whoa!

we need are inside.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.614
What is it, boy?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.749
Can't you run?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.185
All right, I'll carry you.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.687
Told you to be careful
knocking down that wall.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.189
An outsider.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.091
And he's captured Lockjaw!

07:06.093 --> 07:07.859
Release him! Now!

07:07.861 --> 07:10.896
(WHIMPERING)

07:10.898 --> 07:13.064
He's torturing Lord Lockjaw!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.900
Wait! I'm just here for...

07:14.902 --> 07:16.435
(GROANS)

07:16.437 --> 07:18.203
Aw, nuts.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.879
Most of the Alpha Primitives
have been accounted for,

07:27.881 --> 07:31.917
but I have pinpointed one last
unusual life reading here.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.319
I'd say this qualifies
as unusual.
(HEART BEATING)

07:34.321 --> 07:36.655
Energy readings
are off the chart.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.791
SEEKER: Terrigen emissions
are incredible.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.460
This changes everything!

07:41.462 --> 07:43.595
What do you mean?
What is that thing?

07:43.597 --> 07:46.097
SEEKER: Well,
when an Inhuman...
It's... It's nothing.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.233
Merely an Inhuman right.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.803
Wait. If it's nothing,
then why are you Inhumans
so concerned?

07:51.805 --> 07:56.308
Black Bolt, Medusa,
please explain to us
what we are dealing with.

07:56.310 --> 08:00.245
Black Bolt has decreed
this is Inhuman business only.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.348
We owe you
no further explanation.

08:03.350 --> 08:07.118
You have one last
chance to leave this
place peacefully.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.653
We suggest you take it.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
Is that a threat?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.858
We're not going anywhere
without answers.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.060
Here's your answer!
(GRUNTS)

08:16.629 --> 08:18.530

08:20.266 --> 08:22.834
I really hate that answer.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.539
Thought we were on
the same side!

(GROANS)

08:40.953 --> 08:42.687
(GROANS)

08:43.688 --> 08:45.357
This battle is not good.

08:45.359 --> 08:49.027
Especially so close
to an awakening.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.830
Avengers versus Inhumans
is madness.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.633
Surely you and I
can reach an agreement!

08:54.967 --> 08:56.401
(GROANS)

09:22.696 --> 09:24.563
Care to tell me
how you did that?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.999
I have the ability to find
the weakest point of anything.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.302

Unhand me!

I can let you go after
you talk some sense

I'm with Lockjaw!
He brought me!

Now you tell me.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.848
You go get that crystal.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.751
I'll hold them off

11:31.692 --> 11:32.857
You can't fly.

11:37.063 --> 11:41.633
In Attilan, we had
heard legends of
the heroic Avengers.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.869
How disappointing to learn
we have nothing in common.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.705
Nothing in common
with you, huh?

11:46.707 --> 11:48.707
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

We thought you Avengers
might be different.

(GUARD WHIMPERING)
But like every
group of humans,

12:00.687 --> 12:03.221
you punish and persecute
us without reason!

12:03.223 --> 12:05.724
Punish and persecute?
We just want to help,

You can trust us.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.109
I have tried to reach you

13:42.422 --> 13:43.788
And now I understand

13:43.790 --> 13:45.890
why you Inhumans
keep your distance.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.992
You are afraid.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.162
Afraid of the outside world.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.864
Afraid of the future.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.933
Afraid of those

This cannot be.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.895
It came from the library.

Hatched a living Inferno!

Uh, wait a second.
Terrigen Mists have
no effect on humans.

You say "infected."

We say "blessed."

Somehow this kid must
have been an Inhuman

I've lived in Maple Falls
my whole life.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.869
I have friends
and family here.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.272
I'm starting college
in the fall,
and now you tell me...

19:34.274 --> 19:37.942
You are one of us,
and have always been.

19:37.944 --> 19:41.612
We are just as surprised
as you are, Dante.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.516
If it weren't for Seeker's
accident, we might never
have found you.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.351
Does this mean
you'll take me away?

19:47.353 --> 19:50.321
All right,
not to bust up
the reunion

19:50.323 --> 19:52.190
but that might not
be a good thing.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.158
This is a lot to process.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.327
We don't want
to overwhelm him.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.898
No. Perhaps he should remain
among the humans he knows.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.402
However, this does give
our young friend
the singular opportunity

20:04.404 --> 20:07.371
to be an ambassador
between our two worlds.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.740
A son of Attilan,
raised as a human,

20:09.742 --> 20:13.711
would have much
to teach us all,
if we are willing to learn.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.818
Well...

20:20.820 --> 20:23.221
As long as I can come home
for long weekends,

20:23.223 --> 20:25.323
then sure.

20:25.325 --> 20:29.327
Inhumans raised as humans
living amongst us.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.195
It's all too much for me.

20:31.197 --> 20:35.032
But if Black Bolt agrees,
then so say we all.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.101
BOTH: So say we all.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.705
A thank you, Son of Asgard,
from one regent...

20:40.707 --> 20:44.609
I mean, from one friend
to another.

Aw. Huh?

Terrigen by itself would
have aroused suspicion.

But by staging a crash
with contaminated Terrigen,

20:58.591 --> 21:01.592
the Royal Family accepted
the birth of a new Inhuman

21:01.594 --> 21:04.595
as only a happy coincidence.

21:04.597 --> 21:09.267
Experiments in creating new
Inhumans do not interest me.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.703
But, master, my experiment
was a success.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.973
Now I can recreate it
on a much larger scale,

21:15.975 --> 21:20.244
and I can build you
the device you crave.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.247
Then continue
with your plans, Seeker.

are numbered.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.619
He will fall.
