WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.002
(jackson) time's running down.
Everything is on the line.

00:03.004 --> 00:05.337
It all comes down
to this, folks.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.306
He crosses half-court...
(computer beeps)

00:07.308 --> 00:09.775
He's up, and it is...

00:09.777 --> 00:11.677
(thuds)
<i>ugly.</i>

00:11.679 --> 00:14.046
Good! That shot is good.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.748
This game is over, folks.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.083
(imitates crowd cheering)
it wasn't even in.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.320
Listen to this crowd.
Listen to the city.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.055
Touch 'em all, jackson--
running bases now, huh?

00:23.057 --> 00:25.057
Touch them all!
Night, you guys.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.358
(maggie) night.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.761
<i>Wow.</i> Look at you.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.696
Tough shift?
Tough week.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.498
You should treat yourself
to something nice.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.733
I intend to.
No, you don't.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.735
How do you know? Maybe I have
a whole evening planned.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.438
Home, shower, glass of wine,
studying notes,

00:39.440 --> 00:40.606
And if you're feeling
really crazy,

00:40.608 --> 00:41.807
Second glass of wine.
Am I close?

00:41.809 --> 00:43.709
Mm, not an attractive
quality, you know--

00:43.711 --> 00:45.644
The smugness?
I don't know.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.312
I feel like it's a little bit
of a turn-on.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.215
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:51.483
(sighs)
hey.

00:51.485 --> 00:56.321
Hmm?
Alex? Are you uh...
Never mind.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.756
There you are.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.591
I thought we had
a session this evening.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.093
Was that today?

01:01.095 --> 01:03.662
Y--ten minutes ago.
Oh. Sorry, gavin, I--

01:03.664 --> 01:06.632
I meant to cancel.
It's no longer necessary.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.067
Yeah, that stuff
you got me on--

01:08.069 --> 01:09.468
The, uh...
(pills rattle)

01:09.470 --> 01:12.071
Whatever it is--
it's, uh, working like a charm.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.373
Olanzapine.
Yeah, if I'd known,
I would have--

01:14.375 --> 01:16.341
I would have gotten some
of this ages ago.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.810
Hallucinations
are totally gone.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.111
Well, I'm glad that you're
seeing some progress.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.647
Yeah. No spirits,
no ghosts,

01:21.649 --> 01:23.782
Not even so much
as a chill down my spine.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.350
So... Thank you.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.618
I think, uh...
I think we're done.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.253
(pats arm)

01:28.255 --> 01:31.723
How about just for a second
you pretend

01:31.725 --> 01:33.659
Like you're not
four times smarter than me,

01:33.661 --> 01:36.228
And that I might actually
know what I'm talking about.

01:36.230 --> 01:36.428
What do you say?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.235
You use that tone
with all your patients?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.703
Nope.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.272
Those meds are part
of your therapy,

01:47.274 --> 01:49.341
And talk is the other part.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.411
And we have 40 minutes left.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.679
We're gonna use 'em.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.350
Fine, but I don't like
your office.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.785
Okay.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.420
The couch smells,

02:01.422 --> 02:04.223
Like onions...

02:04.225 --> 02:06.325
And shame.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.759
Then we'll walk.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.261
Fine.

02:10.597 --> 02:14.299
(siren wailing in distance)

02:14.301 --> 02:16.802
(door creaks)

02:16.804 --> 02:18.504
(whispers indistinctly)

02:18.506 --> 02:20.439
(gasps) je--
oh! I'm sorry.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.507
I'm so sorry.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.676
No problem.
Wow, you're gorgeous.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.811
Thank you.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.179
No, no, no.
Hang on, hang on.

02:27.181 --> 02:30.315
You work here? You're--
you're a doctor?

02:30.317 --> 02:31.683
A very tired one.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.819
No, I-I've managed
to creep you out

02:33.821 --> 02:35.521
In record time. I'm...
(alarm chirps)

02:35.523 --> 02:37.589
Not actually a creep.
(hiccups)

02:37.591 --> 02:39.258
Mm, you might not
be the best judge of that.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.426
(chuckles)
no, no, see the thing
is I could...

02:41.428 --> 02:43.162
Sort of use some help.
I'm a little lost.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.430
I... (chuckles)

02:45.432 --> 02:47.199
I can't find my car.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.169
(sighs)
what does it look like?

02:50.171 --> 02:51.837
It's, uh, that awful
car color--

02:51.839 --> 02:56.208
Like a beige-y silver ch--
champagne...

02:56.210 --> 02:58.644
Is what they call it,
if that... Helps.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.881
Have you tried
using the remote...

03:02.883 --> 03:06.185
See, that's smart. That's--
that's doctor smart.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.853
You must be used to that.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.721
Always having the right answers
comes with the job.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.423
(chuckles)

03:11.425 --> 03:12.558
(clicks button)

03:12.560 --> 03:13.725
Huh.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.861
Wrong level?
Maybe.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.231
But at least...
I have a plan.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.732
Thank you.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.769
(footsteps retreating)
do you think you should
be driving?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.804
Are you offering me
a ride?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.739
Not even a little bit.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.575
Have a good evening, doctor.

03:32.645 --> 03:33.979
(sighs)

03:40.386 --> 03:41.486
(sighs)

03:41.488 --> 03:42.988
(clicking button)

03:46.292 --> 03:48.594
Sir, I really don't think
you should be driving.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.495
Is--is there anyone
you can call?

03:50.497 --> 03:52.297
There's two types of people
in this world, doctor...

03:52.299 --> 03:53.565
(tires screech)

03:53.567 --> 03:54.800
(thuds)
(gasps)

03:54.802 --> 03:56.969
Oh, my god.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.571
(alex) sir?!
(woman gasps) oh, my god!

03:59.573 --> 04:00.839
Sir, you're gonna be fine.
(speaks indistinctly)

04:00.841 --> 04:02.608
I didn't see him.
Oh, my--

04:02.610 --> 04:03.842
No, no, no, no, no!
Sir!

04:03.844 --> 04:04.876
Did you see that?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.411
He just came
out of nowhere.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.447
I mean, he just came
right behind that pillar.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.382
(panting) you know what?
Maybe you shouldn't touch him.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.683
I don't think
you're supposed to touch him.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.884
There's a phone
in my purse. Get it!

04:12.886 --> 04:15.954
What?
Phone, purse, now!

04:15.956 --> 04:17.556
Over there.
Okay.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.324
Go in my contacts.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.559
Shouldn't I call 9-1-1?

04:20.561 --> 04:22.294
No! This is faster.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.962
I really think I'm supposed
to call 9-1-1.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.366
You need to stop thinking
and do exactly as I say, okay?

04:27.368 --> 04:29.334
Okay. Password?

04:29.336 --> 04:32.304
5-1-5-1. Go in my contacts.
Zach miller--

04:32.306 --> 04:34.439
Call him.
(panting)

04:34.441 --> 04:35.907
Oh, my--you saw
the whole thing, right?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.342
I mean he just came out
behind that pillar.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.011
I mean, you witnessed it.
There's no way

04:39.013 --> 04:40.679
I could have avoided him.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.849
Yes, hello?
Put it to my ear!
Put it to my ear!

04:43.851 --> 04:46.885
Zach, I need a code team
to the parkade--

04:46.887 --> 04:49.321
Level p2, south side.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.756
I've got a man
hit by a car,

04:50.758 --> 04:55.060
No pulse, no pulse.
Start the clock and hurry.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.296
Okay, what's your name?
Denise.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.031
Denise, my name is alex reid.
I'm a doctor.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.632
Do you know him?
No.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.534
I've never seen him before.
I'm here on business.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.369
There's an orange
plastic case in my purse.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.938
I want you to take it out.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.740
It's a breathing mask
for mouth-to-mouth.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.609
Have you ever used one?
No.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.979
You know, I-I really can't
get involved.
(clatters)

05:13.981 --> 05:15.047
I hate to break it to you,
denise,

05:15.049 --> 05:16.915
But you're very involved.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.517
No, I just mean
that if--if this man's hurt,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.852
I can't--I have to protect
myself legally.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.454
He's not hurt.
He's dead.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.722
And you and I are going
to do everything we can

05:23.724 --> 05:25.357
To cure him if that. Okay?

05:25.359 --> 05:27.893
I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do that.
(panting)

05:27.895 --> 05:29.728
I-I'm... I...

05:29.730 --> 05:32.030
(rustles)
I can't believe
this is happening right now.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.767
I didn't know that he was--
he just came out behind there,

05:35.769 --> 05:37.002
And I didn't--I didn't--
I-I mean,

05:37.004 --> 05:40.672
My dad's gonna kill me.
Denise! Denise!
Try to remain calm.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.574
Okay, denise?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.376
Now we need to find out
who this man is.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.544
Can you do that?
Mm-hmm.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.678
Okay. Good.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.650
(exhales deeply)
(whispers) two, three, four.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.951
(rustles)

05:54.754 --> 05:57.389
(clatters)

05:57.391 --> 05:58.724
There's no wallet.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.593
Uh, business cards?
Cell phone?

06:01.595 --> 06:05.564
I mean, jesus, where's the help?
What's taking them so long?!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.966
They're 3 minutes away.
How do you know that?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.969
Because if they take any longer,
we won't get him back.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.640
(panting)
(zach) alex?

06:15.642 --> 06:18.844
(wheels clacking,
siren wailing in distance)

06:18.846 --> 06:23.415
All right, maggie--bag.
Jackson--chest. Let's go.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.750
(alex continues panting)

06:24.752 --> 06:27.052
(thud)

06:27.054 --> 06:30.655
Change in three, two, one...

06:30.657 --> 06:32.557
Now!
Now!

06:32.559 --> 06:34.626
(breathing heavily)
direct hit.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.661
Hit on the right side.
He hit the ground.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.465
Multiple rib fractures,
bleeding from the head.
(instruments clattering)

06:40.467 --> 06:41.867
(zach) all right,
let's get a line in him.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.868
I think he's drunk.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.037
No, I was talking to him
earlier. He was disoriented.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.406
Might be drugs.
Okay.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.740
Here, give me some room.
Give me some room.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.742
<i>Okay!</i>

06:50.744 --> 06:52.744
All right, let's get naloxone
when you're in.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.079
Got it.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.614
(jackson) okay, that's 30.

06:55.616 --> 06:59.751
Bag. Do a rhythm check here.
(device beeps)

06:59.753 --> 07:03.789
Everyone else off.
I'm charging to 160.
(defibrillator whines)

07:03.791 --> 07:05.624
(grinds)
(grunts)

07:05.626 --> 07:06.892
And...
(beeps)

07:06.894 --> 07:08.960
Off the chest. Ready?
Ready!

07:08.962 --> 07:12.097
(monitor beeping rapidly,
equipment clattering)

07:12.099 --> 07:14.433
Counting 30.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.569
You go grab the spine board.
Pushing 1 amp epi.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.004
(denise) did it work?
What's happening?

07:19.006 --> 07:21.006
Don't know yet.
What--what do you mean
you don't know?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.874
Just try to let us
do our job, okay?

07:22.876 --> 07:26.011
And pushing 1 amp naloxone
and saline.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.446
And...
(click)

07:27.448 --> 07:29.481
30. Everyone off. Slow breaths.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.882
(air whooshes)

07:30.884 --> 07:32.551
Let's get him
on this board.
Okay.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.653
You got the neck?
(maggie) I got the head, yeah.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.221
Here we go.
Ready?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.956
(strained voice) okay.
(board slides)

07:40.626 --> 07:42.928
(grunts)

07:42.930 --> 07:45.230
Okay, on my count,
you guys ready?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.531
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.033
On three.
One, two, three...

07:48.035 --> 07:51.503
(zach) let's package him
and get moving. Let's go!

07:51.505 --> 07:53.205
(grunts)

07:53.207 --> 07:54.606
(jackson) there you go.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.641
(rail clicks)

07:56.643 --> 07:58.176
(rail clicks)

07:58.178 --> 08:01.079
Okay, let's make room
for this in here.
(clatters)

08:01.081 --> 08:03.148
(zach) hop aboard, lin.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.587
Okay, good. Here we go.
(alex) look out. Go, go, go!

08:08.589 --> 08:10.155
What can I do?

08:10.157 --> 08:12.891
Call the police!
(wheels clacking)

08:12.893 --> 08:15.026
I can see the chest rise.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.796
(jackson) I'm on the airway.
Ready to get the next breath.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.030
(zach) all right,
I got the door.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.933
Careful around this corner.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.603
Good work, lin.
Stay on him. Stay on him!

08:26.772 --> 08:27.873
His ribs are starting to go.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.040
That's all right.
Keep going.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.275
Break 'em all
if you have to, lin.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.080
Cycle.
Okay, vent him.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.883
(air whooshes)

08:37.885 --> 08:39.784
(whispers) come on.
(elevator bell dings)

08:39.786 --> 08:40.986
Why don't you tell me
what you want me to say

08:40.988 --> 08:42.287
So I can stop guessing--
out! Get back.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.189
Out of the elevator!
We're going up!

08:44.191 --> 08:46.758
(man) come on, let's go.
Here, here, here, here.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.627
It's almost three cycles.
(beeps)

08:48.629 --> 08:49.995
Here, cycle her off, jackson.
Here we go.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.196
Charging to 250.
Changing in three...

08:51.198 --> 08:52.531
(jackson and maggie)
two... One...

08:52.533 --> 08:53.565
(beeps)
now!

08:53.567 --> 08:56.301
(beeps, defibrillator whines)
(zach) charging to 200.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.769
(maggie) got it?
Come on, come on, come on.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.638
I got it.
And...

08:59.640 --> 09:01.306
(beeps)
off! Everybody off!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.174
(paddles thunk)

09:03.176 --> 09:04.643
Resuming.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.712
(gurney rattling)

09:13.052 --> 09:14.753
Okay, let's see what we got.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.959
No, this does not end
in an elevator.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.928
Okay, then you're up.
Okay.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.129
(man) here, here.
Right here, buddy.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.130
(bell dings)
(alex) ready.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.731
(maggie) stay back.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.766
(zach) here we go!

09:27.768 --> 09:31.036
You all right?
You okay?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.304
(alex) get out of the way!

09:32.306 --> 09:34.239
Ohh.
(whispers indistinctly)

09:35.675 --> 09:38.743
(alex breathing heavily)

09:41.013 --> 09:42.847
Let's talk timelines.

09:42.849 --> 09:47.118
You said your visions appear
a couple of times a week.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.054
Am I right?
Uh, it varies,

09:49.056 --> 09:50.855
Or   <i>varied</i>but yep.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.724
And the last one
you saw was...

09:52.726 --> 09:56.127
What, ten days ago?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.796
See, I knew you were
gonna do this.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.097
What?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.365
You're gonna tell me
that, uh,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.167
This could be just a lull,

10:02.169 --> 10:04.035
That maybe I'm not cured
after all.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.638
I'm not sure it's useful
to think in terms of cured.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.307
That's because you're not
the sick one, gavin.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.843
Tell me about the last spirit
that you saw.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.778
(sighs deeply) gavin.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.980
They're gone, okay?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.148
They were, uh,
a trick of my mind,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.617
And you fixed it.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.918
Can't we just
be happy with it?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.987
(doors bang)
coming through!
Out of the way!

10:21.989 --> 10:23.054
Whoa!

10:23.056 --> 10:24.923
(zach) look out!

10:24.925 --> 10:26.324
You good?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.726
Yeah, got it!

10:30.062 --> 10:31.363
(jackson) having trouble
bagging.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.398
Veins are distended.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.035
Shifted trachea.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.703
(jackson)
tension pneumothorax.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.239
John doe, 20s,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.974
Hit by a car, v.A.S.,
1 amp of epi,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.175
1 amp of naloxone.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.845
Shocked him at 160 and 200,
no r.O.S.C.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.047
Let's intubate him.
Let's go. On three.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.682
(zach and maggie)
one, two, three!
(all grunt)

10:50.684 --> 10:52.917
(thuds)

10:52.919 --> 10:54.786
Okay?
(zach)
get a chest tube in him.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.088
On it. Swab him!

10:57.090 --> 10:59.124
Lin, let's run a f.A.S.T.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.392
(maggie) yeah.
How about sharp?

11:00.394 --> 11:02.160
Sharp out.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.197
(monitor beeping erratically)
(jackson) back on.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.198
(maggie) we in?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.401
Get the tube ready.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.804
Pleurovac.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.673
(monitor continues
beeping erratically)

11:14.675 --> 11:17.442
F.A.S.T. Is negative.
(zach) great. Okay.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.811
Matt, let's charge to 360.
Let's go.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.279
Almost there.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.682
(beeps, defibrillator whines)
here we go now. Clear.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.916
Come on, alex.
Let's go. Let's go.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.284
Okay, go, go, go!

11:26.286 --> 11:27.318
Okay, clear!

11:27.320 --> 11:28.953
(all) clear!
(paddles thunk)

11:28.955 --> 11:31.923
Counting 30.
All right, 1 amp of epi.
Let's go.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.124
(maggie) on it.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.727
(flatlining continues)

11:35.729 --> 11:37.262
Let's keep going.
Again.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.697
All right, all right.
You take carotid,

11:38.699 --> 11:40.031
I'll take the femoral.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.136
26, 27, 28, 29, 30!

11:45.138 --> 11:46.237
Epi's in.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.941
(ventilator whooshes,
monitor beeps)

11:49.943 --> 11:52.410
I think I've--
I've got something.
Just--just wait.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.945
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:53.947 --> 11:57.082
I think that's
a pulse ox waveform, folks.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.216
Whew!
(sighs)

11:58.218 --> 11:59.751
Good work, team.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.152
Guy got schmucked
in the right parking lot.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.754
(sighs) welcome back.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.223
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no!

12:05.225 --> 12:06.791
We're not
out of the woods yet.

12:06.793 --> 12:07.826
The clock stays on.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.828
It's bad luck.
Sorry.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.863
Hey, zach.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.364
This look a little
oozy to you?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.266
A little bit, yeah.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.868
Anticoagulants.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.136
The guy's barely 30.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.471
Yeah, but he's got
a big scar,

12:19.473 --> 12:21.206
He's got a bunch
of miles on him.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.741
We'll find out more when
we put him through the scan.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.842
All right.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.243
Isn't your shift over?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.411
Ugh. Half an hour ago.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.346
Ugh! Such a keener.
Thanks for that.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.381
All right, let's get
a foley catheter in him

12:30.383 --> 12:32.050
And get him to c.T.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.054
I'll catch up with you guys.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.794
Hey.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.828
Thank you.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.230
Is he okay?
Did he make it?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.499
(sighs)
he's hanging in there.

12:47.501 --> 12:51.870
Um... What would you--
what should I do with these?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.104
Are these his keys?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.305
Mm-hmm.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.440
I got 'em.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.942
Jackson.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.811
Yeah.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.146
Can you find his car?

13:01.148 --> 13:04.082
You want me to let myself
into a total stranger's car,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.483
Go through his stuff?

13:05.485 --> 13:06.518
Yes.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.153
Cool.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.290
Did you call the police?
Yeah.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.192
Yeah, they're on
their way.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.395
They're just gonna need
a statement from you.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.164
Okay, so what should I
tell them?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.332
(siren wailing in distance)
the truth.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.535
Right.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.037
Um... I don't know
how you do it--

13:26.039 --> 13:28.139
Stay so calm.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.575
It's just my job.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.111
I'm in linens.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.513
It's a family business,
and my--my dad's my boss.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.049
And actually he, um,
he told me that whatever--

13:38.051 --> 13:40.585
I'm not supposed to talk
to the police right now

13:40.587 --> 13:42.954
Until he gets here
with our lawyer. And...

13:42.956 --> 13:44.255
Is he going to die?

13:44.257 --> 13:47.158
I don't know.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.893
Oh.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.496
I think I'm gonna
throw up.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.099
It's just, you know,
if he's not gonna make it...

13:55.101 --> 13:58.603
Okay, wait.
Just hold on, all right?

13:58.605 --> 14:00.271
When I know something,

14:00.273 --> 14:01.973
I'll come and talk to you,
okay?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.074
(baby crying in distance)

14:03.076 --> 14:05.310
(whispers) okay.

14:07.546 --> 14:08.847
(door closes)

14:08.849 --> 14:11.216
(whirring)

14:11.218 --> 14:12.517
(woman, filtered voice) all set.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.052
Here we go.
(machine beeps)

14:15.521 --> 14:18.590
(whirring continues)

14:19.892 --> 14:21.059
(clank)

14:23.229 --> 14:25.096
(monitor beeping rapidly)

14:27.433 --> 14:30.101
Zach. Tachycardic.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.870
No.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.137
No, no, no.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.505
(flatlining)
come on.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.209
Code. Call the code.
Shut it down!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.377
Get him out of there!

14:39.379 --> 14:40.879
(receiver clatters)

14:40.881 --> 14:42.647
We have a code blue--
c.T. Room 1.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.016
(flatlining continues)

14:45.018 --> 14:46.484
All right, ready?
On three.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.652
One... Two...

14:47.654 --> 14:49.654
Three!

14:49.656 --> 14:51.256
Okay, get up on his chest,
start compressions.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.892
<i>(woman on p.A.)</i>
<i>code blue, c.T. Room 1.</i>

14:56.028 --> 14:57.896
Get outta my way.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.964
(alex panting)

14:59.966 --> 15:01.599
Right on time, reid.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.944
Foley's dry. Zero output.
Well, put another line in
and flood him.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.679
How we doing?
Cuts only go down
to his collarbone.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.681
(alex) come on, zach.
What do you got?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.516
Just give us some good news.
We didn't get the scan.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.385
(maggie) v-fib again.
Clear to move.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.220
Belly's distended.
It's a bleed.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.254
He's hemorrhaging.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.522
We need to do
a thoracotomy now.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.491
No, we need to get
his volume up, do an ex-lap.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.393
(zach) put your knives away.
We don't even have a tox screen.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.627
You were looking
at the monitor.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.996
He's hypovolemic.
He has cardiac history.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.531
Dry foley, distended belly.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.401
I'm looking at one right here.
Enough!

15:36.403 --> 15:38.136
(alex) whoa, whoa! Slow down!
(clatters)

15:38.138 --> 15:40.571
(screams)
whoa! Everyone, stop!

15:40.573 --> 15:41.673
(monitor beeping rapidly)

15:41.675 --> 15:43.508
Not you.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.544
Are you okay?
(breathing heavily)

15:46.546 --> 15:50.715
Now I'm running this code.
You will take direction from me

15:50.717 --> 15:52.150
And me alone, understood?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.384
Yep.
(alex) yes.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.652
Now let's go.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.020
We restart the code sequence
from the beginning.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.690
Abcs. We find the problem,
then we fix it.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.162
Sorry.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.496
(zach) we need a crash cart
over here right now.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.265
Charge to 360.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.399
Lin, run a f.A.S.T.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.567
Yep.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.470
(machine beeps)

16:15.641 --> 16:17.575
(beeps, defibrillator whines)

16:20.012 --> 16:22.747
Okay, everyone off.
Everyone off.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.749
(beeps)

16:24.751 --> 16:28.186
(paddles thunk, beeps)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.221
Okay, back on him.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.224
F.A.S.T. Is... Negative.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.626
Mnh. No, no, no.
It's, uh...

16:35.628 --> 16:38.062
It's, um...
More words, dr. Lin.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.231
It's muddled.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.533
It's fluid. I mean, isn't it?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.102
(beeps)

16:44.104 --> 16:47.071
Okay, everyone off.
Pause for rhythm checks.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.406
Slow breaths.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.209
(beeps)

16:53.379 --> 16:56.114
(monitor beeping steadily)

16:56.116 --> 16:57.682
And we're back.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.618
All right, let's get this guy
in the o.R.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.186
(monitor continues
beeping steadily)

17:02.188 --> 17:05.656
Looks like you're gonna get
your ex-lap after all.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.325
Give me this.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.761
Good call.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.329
Someone page dawn bell.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.364
This guy's really starting
to piss me off.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.799
Come on.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.267
You're not here.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.703
Come on.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.738
Come on.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.608
Come on. Come on.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.080
(alex) incising.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.248
Knife.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.449
(maggie) retractor.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.425
Whoa. Scissors.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.260
(machine beeps)

17:42.262 --> 17:45.363
Whoa. Yeah. That is fluid.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.697
Well, let's move it, alex.
Find that bleed.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.667
Let's open another channel
of saline. Full blast.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.569
(suction gurgling)

17:51.571 --> 17:53.404
(machine beeps)
talk to me.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.240
Eviscerating the bowel
and evacuating.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.343
(sighs) I'm packing
the four quadrants.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.478
Let's go. Keep 'em coming.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.813
(machine beeps)

18:01.815 --> 18:04.582
(suction continues gurgling)

18:05.751 --> 18:07.752
Oh, boy.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.153
(sighs deeply)

18:09.155 --> 18:10.455
Okay.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.723
All right.

18:12.725 --> 18:16.227
Liver is okay.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.129
Pelvis okay.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.564
Find something.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.165
Uh...

18:21.167 --> 18:22.433
Upper left quadrant.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.302
Spleen?
Maybe.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.436
(machine beeps)

18:25.438 --> 18:26.637
No, no, no.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.872
Give him more blood.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.607
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.741
We're at 20 minutes here.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.876
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:31.878 --> 18:33.744
You got somewhere
you need to be, zach?

18:33.746 --> 18:34.879
(scoffs)

18:34.881 --> 18:37.181
Right on his chest, lin.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.283
Let's count a cycle.
Let's go.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.352
Okay. Hey.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.421
Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.490
Give him more blood.
Keep it under pressure.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.893
(machine beeping, flatlining)
give me more sponges!

18:48.895 --> 18:51.395
(whispers) ugh. Jesus.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.897
(sighs deeply)

18:52.899 --> 18:55.233
(flatlining continues)
(mutters) did I miss it?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.679
(dawn) what do we have?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.481
John doe versus car.
He's all over the map.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.450
Got r.O.S.C. After
tension pneumo.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.652
Took him to c.T.,
crashed halfway through.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.354
Got him back,
positive f.A.S.T.,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.689
Started an ex-lap,
he coded again.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.824
Let's get this crash cart
in there.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.726
Is that clock accurate?
Yeah.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.428
For how long?
(alex) 4 minutes, maybe 5.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.831
He had good compressions
the rest of the time.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.166
I was there
when he went down.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.434
Okay, shocking to 360.
Everyone off!

19:30.436 --> 19:32.537
(machine beeps)
(alex and maggie) clear!

19:32.539 --> 19:34.872
(paddles thunk)

19:34.874 --> 19:36.207
(monitor beeping steadily)
back on.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.775
Dawn, I'm close.
I can find it.

19:37.777 --> 19:42.713
So we cross-clamp the aorta,
stop the bleed,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.348
And keep his brain perfused.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.583
How many times you hit him?
Five.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.854
Epi, naloxone, vasopressin,
an ocean of lidocaine.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.857
Can someone say something that
makes this not a lost cause?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.392
If we can get his volume up,
he'll go.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.960
He's still here.
He wants to go.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.529
Can someone say something
medical?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.697
(zach) 70 b.P.M.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.899
(whispers) what?
And holding.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.637
Flair for the dramatic.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.973
All right, I'm starting to see
what you guys see in this guy.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.708
Page dr. Kendall.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.444
Dr. Reid, put your toys away.
We're gonna do a thoracotomy.

20:13.446 --> 20:17.315
(sighs deeply) cutting it
awfully close, my friend.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.417
Okay. Well, this is where
I tap out.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.719
Hey, reid, make me a promise?

20:21.721 --> 20:22.853
What's that?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.455
If my heart ever stops,
be nearby.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.990
(alex sighs)

20:25.992 --> 20:28.593
That sounded
vaguely romantic.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.395
I wasn't going for romantic.
Just--just sayin'.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.737
(siren wailing)

20:47.412 --> 20:48.546
Excuse me.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.549
Uh, doctor,
can I talk to you for a sec?

20:51.551 --> 20:54.318
We sorta met earlier.
(lowered voice) in the elevator?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.420
Oh.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.955
Right. I'm, uh...

20:57.957 --> 20:59.957
Sorry your family had to
see that.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.592
(sighs)

21:01.594 --> 21:03.928
Is he, uh...
Is he gonna make it?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.696
You know that guy?

21:05.698 --> 21:09.600
No. W-we're here
for my--my son.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.569
Uh, bone marrow biopsy.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.304
I'm sorry.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.574
Yeah, they're, uh,
talking about leukemia.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.976
We're praying for
the best.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.412
Anyway, he's been asking
about that guy,

21:21.414 --> 21:23.581
You know, and I...

21:23.583 --> 21:25.516
Just...

21:25.518 --> 21:27.785
I'm afraid I can't talk about
other patients.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.320
Right. No, of course not.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.454
You know, it's just...

21:30.456 --> 21:32.423
Yeah.
(woman) sweetheart?

21:32.425 --> 21:36.827
I--okay, I'll be right there.
Just give me...

21:36.829 --> 21:39.697
(whispers)
I'll be right there.

21:39.699 --> 21:43.301
When he saw the tattoo
of the planets on the guy's arm,

21:43.303 --> 21:46.504
He decided that he must be
an astronaut. So...

21:46.506 --> 21:48.739
(indistinct conversations)

21:48.741 --> 21:51.742
(sighs) this whole thing's
been hell, you know?

21:51.744 --> 21:53.010
Test after test.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.446
Me and his mom at
each other's throats. Right?

21:55.448 --> 21:57.014
And seeing the guy laid out
like that. It was just...

21:57.016 --> 22:01.452
I was just really hoping
that you could tell me

22:01.454 --> 22:03.988
So I could tell him that
the guy's gonna live.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.624
Wish I knew.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.459
I can tell you
he's in good hands.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.061
Thanks.

22:12.564 --> 22:13.764
Scalpel.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.110
Scissors.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.722
(dawn) rib spreader.

22:41.059 --> 22:46.030
(clicking)

22:47.566 --> 22:49.633
Heads up. Sharp bone.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.405
Chest cavity looks dry.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.073
Locating
inferior pulmonary ligament.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.408
Why, lin?

22:57.410 --> 22:58.743
To free up the lung.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.010
Exactly. To free up the lung.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.012
And how do I know
when I've found it?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.781
Um...

23:03.783 --> 23:06.150
Exactly. I don't.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.619
It's a blind... Cut.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.887
(machine beeps)

23:09.889 --> 23:11.922
But being really good helps.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.759
(beeping)

23:14.761 --> 23:17.027
Pericardial adhesions?

23:17.029 --> 23:18.095
From his previous surgery?

23:18.097 --> 23:19.797
Looks like it.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.065
Scalpel.

23:21.067 --> 23:26.637
Small starter cut,
anterior to the phrenic nerve.
(snips)

23:35.514 --> 23:36.647
Okay, let's hope
there's no blood in here.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.782
What do you say, reid?

23:37.784 --> 23:39.884
Ugh. Knowing this guy,
count on it.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.819
Got a nice color.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.155
Heart looks... Pretty good.

23:44.157 --> 23:47.057
All right, kids,
now we're in the deep end.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.159
(gavin) let's switch gears
for a minute.

23:48.161 --> 23:49.760
(charlie) okay, now.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.962
I wonder if you can tell me
about the positive side

23:51.964 --> 23:53.097
Of this experience.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.632
Of the hallucinations?

23:54.634 --> 23:57.568
Would you describe them
as helpful in any way?

23:57.570 --> 24:01.739
They're great for getting rid
of unwanted self-esteem,

24:01.741 --> 24:04.041
Alienating people,
things like that.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.609
Were they ever helpful
to you?

24:05.611 --> 24:10.448
This is where you tell me
my neuroses are my tools, right?

24:10.450 --> 24:13.617
You had a traumatic experience.
You created strategies to cope.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.720
I don't bite my nails, gavin.
I saw things that weren't there.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.155
Still, sometimes people
find it difficult

24:18.157 --> 24:19.490
To let go
of those strategies.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.525
Hence, why we're here.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.494
What I mean is
that sometimes you discover

24:23.496 --> 24:25.162
That you don't want
to let them go.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.831
Wrong.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.936
Is it?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.505
Try to stay
with the tour here, doc.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.774
I walked away from the woman
I love because of this.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.877
Best thing that ever happened
to me, hands down.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.613
I pushed her away.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.482
Okay. Well, it's just that
you told me

24:44.484 --> 24:46.550
That you see these spirits
when people are near death.

24:46.552 --> 24:47.751
Yeah.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.019
Mostly in the o.R.
Or in emerg.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.754
Yeah, where the dying happens.
And?

24:50.756 --> 24:52.923
And you've led me on two laps
of this hospital,

24:52.925 --> 24:55.125
But carefully avoided
those areas.

24:56.762 --> 25:00.598
That maybe you're not sure
that they're gone.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.668
'cause you're not sure that
you want them to be gone.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.938
Vitals are stable.
Okay, good.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.073
All right,
I'm gonna need you to--

25:09.075 --> 25:10.741
Hey, is this
the parking lot john doe?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.209
You shouldn't be in here,
officer.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.912
As soon as we know,
we'll come and tell you.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.847
Yeah, how 'bout a hint?
Please, sir.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.216
Look, if this guy dies,
I'm here all night. Okay?

25:19.218 --> 25:21.552
But if he lives, I get to eat
breakfast with my kids.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.522
Get out of the operating room!
<i>Now!</i>

25:25.690 --> 25:28.859
Uh, you seem busy.
I'll check back later.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.928
(scoffs)

25:30.930 --> 25:32.029
(machine beeps)

25:32.031 --> 25:33.163
What?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.065
Nothing.
Insert a gastric tube.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.800
No, tell me.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.602
Just an observation.

25:38.604 --> 25:40.304
In here, you're bold
and command the room.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.039
Out there, not so much.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.140
(beeps)

25:43.142 --> 25:44.275
What's that supposed
to mean?

25:44.277 --> 25:45.876
There's alex reid the doctor,

25:45.878 --> 25:47.244
And then there's
alex reid the person,

25:47.246 --> 25:51.215
The "wait patiently,
hope for the best" type.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.551
What do you know? We seem to be
talking about charlie.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.786
Word gets around.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.021
(sighs deeply)

25:57.023 --> 25:59.690
He needs some space.
We'll be fine.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.959
I remember telling myself
the same thing.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.595
I wish I'd been around
to get in your business.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.065
Best tool for dissecting
aortic pleura. Lin?

26:08.067 --> 26:09.266
(man) the blood work's in.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.601
What are the headlines?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.269
Just one.
There's an I.V. Contamination.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.837
Your sample's useless.

26:13.839 --> 26:14.972
What?
(groans)

26:14.974 --> 26:16.607
You pulled from his I.V. Side?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.909
There was a lot going on.
There were lines in everywhere.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.678
Get a fresh sample,
take it up yourself. Now.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.846
(maggie) yep.

26:24.816 --> 26:28.252
Fingers, by the way.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.590
Best way to dissect
the aortic pleura.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.826
Have the clamp standing by.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.998
(clicking)

26:41.000 --> 26:44.001
Okay, aorta is clamped. No blood
going to the lower organs.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.837
No time to waste, reid.
Find your bleed.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.839
All right, retractors.

26:50.842 --> 26:53.377
(clicking button)

26:53.379 --> 26:55.145
Come on.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.680
You're kiddin' me.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.748
(car alarm chirps, doors unlock)

26:57.750 --> 26:58.882
Gotcha.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.385
There you are.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.095
Wendy simpson?

27:11.097 --> 27:12.129
(sighs)

27:12.131 --> 27:13.664
Come on.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.868
There's gotta be something
in here.

27:19.171 --> 27:23.741
Dude,
you're not making this easy.
(pills rattle)

27:33.218 --> 27:36.053
Ha! Got it! That's it--
middle colic vein.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.187
Suction.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.156
(dawn) complete tear?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.658
(sighs) no, I can repair it.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.925
Tie it off. Do a colectomy.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.895
Dawn, I'm gonna fix it. Driver.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.932
(suction gurgling)

27:48.934 --> 27:50.067
Pull up.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.402
(sighs deeply)

27:51.404 --> 27:56.173
(sighs deeply) this guy is still
oozing more than I'd like.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.243
Where is the blood work?
Page dr. Lin.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.078
How much heparin
did you use?

28:01.080 --> 28:06.150
Open another channel of saline.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.053
(beeps)

28:10.689 --> 28:13.157
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.326
No, maybe you're right.
Maybe they're not gone.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.128
Well, at least we'll know
where we stand.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.329
(machine beeps)

28:19.331 --> 28:20.998
You seeing anything?

28:23.735 --> 28:25.202
No.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.870
It's all normal.

28:33.078 --> 28:37.047
Angus, I need to know
what this is.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.122
Quickly.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.099
Any chance you can put
a hurry-up on that?

28:55.101 --> 28:58.001
(scoffs) you're the one
who gave me the bad sample.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.436
I'm doing this
for the second time today.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.805
Yeah, you'd think you'd
be better at it by now.

29:01.807 --> 29:05.342
Tell you what--how about we talk
about it in greater detail later

29:05.344 --> 29:09.213
You're up on a pedestal.
That's the problem with doctors.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.915
You're always running around
like rock stars.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.017
How do you run around
on a pedestal?

29:14.019 --> 29:16.487
Here's the thing--I'm gonna
do this right, okay?

29:16.489 --> 29:18.288
Please do.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.430
There it is.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.898
That should hold.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.500
<i>Will</i> hold.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.835
There's only one way
to find out.

29:31.837 --> 29:34.138
Turning the tap back on.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.107
(beeps)

29:38.910 --> 29:42.079
When this guy wakes up, tell him
to buy a lottery ticket.

29:42.081 --> 29:45.849
All right, you got any other
bits you wanna cut open?

29:45.851 --> 29:49.553
All right, then I say
we're done. Let's close him up.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.822
(monitor beeps erratically)
sinoatrial arrest.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.023
(beeps)

29:53.025 --> 29:54.858
He'll even out.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.398
There.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.170
What is it?
What do you see?

30:12.243 --> 30:13.844
I can't hear you.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.313
<i>(speaking inaudibly)</i>

30:16.315 --> 30:18.248
I can't hear you.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.285
(sighs deeply)

30:26.024 --> 30:27.524
(beeps)

30:27.526 --> 30:29.893
Down to 50.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.562
Give him a hit
of amiodarone.

30:31.564 --> 30:36.033
(monitor continues
beeping erratically)

30:39.103 --> 30:40.370
Got it.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.405
Tolvaptan.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.573
What's it for?

30:42.575 --> 30:45.442
Vasopressin receptor
antagonist.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.577
Moderates blood sodium.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.145
He's got a kidney problem?

30:48.147 --> 30:50.080
He's got a kidney problem.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.187
(man) you're welcome.

30:58.489 --> 30:59.923
Oh, god.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.330
(telephone rings)

31:06.332 --> 31:07.464
(ring)

31:07.466 --> 31:09.066
Give him more epi.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.500
(sighs deeply)
(telephone rings)

31:10.502 --> 31:11.635
(woman) he's tanking.
Down to 25.
(ring)

31:11.637 --> 31:12.970
What do you want to do?
Any ideas?

31:12.972 --> 31:14.104
I got nothing.
(ring)

31:14.106 --> 31:15.606
Anyone? Anyone?

31:15.608 --> 31:16.607
Asystole.
(flatlining)

31:16.609 --> 31:17.975
(speaks indistinctly)

31:17.977 --> 31:19.576
Okay, let's shock him.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.111
(ring, defibrillator whines)

31:21.113 --> 31:24.114
There's no way.
He was clamped for 10 minutes.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.249
Clear!
(ring)

31:25.251 --> 31:26.917
(thunk)

31:26.919 --> 31:28.518
(ring)
(flatlining continues)

31:28.520 --> 31:30.587
(sighs deeply)

31:32.624 --> 31:34.524
He's got
chronic renal disorder.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.426
I found a pill in his car--
tolvaptan.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.895
What?

31:37.897 --> 31:40.163
Call for hemodialysis.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.199
It's dr. Lin. His potassium's
through the roof.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.101
(flatlining continues)

31:44.103 --> 31:47.237
Hyperkalemia. (sighs)

31:47.239 --> 31:49.439
No. Flood him
with calcium chloride.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.042
Okay, we're gonna have to flush
him, so 20 units of insulin.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.944
Change his I.V. To d5.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.112
Let's go! Now!

31:55.114 --> 31:56.246
(flatlining continues)

31:56.248 --> 31:58.548
Now!

31:58.550 --> 32:00.083
(click)

32:00.085 --> 32:01.618
Dawn, no! Turn it back on!

32:01.620 --> 32:03.120
Turn it on!

32:03.122 --> 32:05.289
Get zach.

32:05.291 --> 32:09.259
(defibrillator whines)
(breathing heavily)

32:09.261 --> 32:11.128
Clear!

32:11.130 --> 32:14.097
(thunk)

32:14.099 --> 32:16.533
(phoria's "once again" playing)

32:16.535 --> 32:19.403
(monitor beeping erratically)

32:19.405 --> 32:23.707
â™ª

32:23.709 --> 32:28.111
â™ª in my

32:28.113 --> 32:30.514
(monitor continues
beeping erratically)

32:30.516 --> 32:32.416
â™ª

32:32.418 --> 32:36.520
(continues breathing heavily)

32:36.522 --> 32:40.691
â™ª

32:40.693 --> 32:45.162
(flatlining)

32:45.164 --> 32:48.231
â™ª

32:56.307 --> 32:59.376
(continues breathing heavily)

33:18.763 --> 33:20.530
Polycystic kidney disease.

33:20.532 --> 33:24.301
Explains the sternal scar.
Early cardiac damage.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.537
So he skips a couple
dialysis sessions, goes uremic.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.107
I mean, that's why
he seemed drunk.

33:30.109 --> 33:33.377
That's why his blood went bad
so fast.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.023
You all right?

33:46.025 --> 33:49.126
We could've corrected for it.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.395
Maybe. Maybe not.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.363
We could've flooded him
with calcium,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.665
Had a c.V.C standing by
if we'd known.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.135
If he hadn't crashed in the c.T.
If, if, if.

33:58.137 --> 34:02.139
How were we supposed to know
he's got a kidney disease?

34:02.141 --> 34:04.107
I was looking at it
the whole time.

34:04.109 --> 34:08.178
You can feel it. It's right
in the middle of his tattoo.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.081
Port for his dialysis.

34:13.284 --> 34:16.486
We were looking at it
the whole time.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.821
Yeah.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.623
We were.

34:21.259 --> 34:24.528
(sighs)

34:26.464 --> 34:29.633
(door opens)

34:29.635 --> 34:30.767
(door closes)

34:30.769 --> 34:33.136
(indistinct conversations)

34:33.138 --> 34:35.072
(exhales deeply)

34:37.508 --> 34:38.642
I heard.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.845
Listen, you should know,
he was sick.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.447
The accident was
only part of it.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.549
Oh, I just keep playing it
over and over in my head.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.551
You know what?
I just need to--

34:47.553 --> 34:49.219
Does that ever happen
to you?

34:50.555 --> 34:51.688
Yeah.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.524
Well, how do you
make it stop?

34:54.526 --> 34:55.725
You can't.

34:57.328 --> 34:59.162
I just think, if--if I had
reacted faster,

34:59.164 --> 35:00.263
If I had seen him sooner,

35:00.265 --> 35:02.165
If I just--if I hadn't--
denise,

35:02.167 --> 35:04.601
With something like this...

35:04.603 --> 35:07.537
(sighs deeply) you can
tie yourself up on knots,

35:07.539 --> 35:10.440
Second guessing, trying to
make sense of it, and...

35:10.442 --> 35:12.509
That's not your job
right now.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.144
Then what is?

35:14.146 --> 35:15.412
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

35:15.414 --> 35:16.680
You just gotta
let it happen.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.381
Have the feelings,
take your time,

35:18.383 --> 35:20.484
And push through.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.385
(whispers) I don't know.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.421
I do.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.690
<i>(man speaks indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

35:29.327 --> 35:31.228
Okay. Um...

35:31.230 --> 35:32.696
So what am I gonna
tell my dad right now?

35:32.698 --> 35:36.166
Because he's gonna want to
talk about this blow-by-blow,

35:36.168 --> 35:39.302
And I-I really can't do that
right now.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.238
Sure you can.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.440
(exhales deeply)

35:44.509 --> 35:46.443
There he is.

35:48.679 --> 35:51.548
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.888
<i>(man speaks indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

36:04.729 --> 36:06.730
So what are you
thinking about?

36:10.201 --> 36:12.669
I'm thinking that, um...

36:15.606 --> 36:18.375
I think this has been
really productive, gavin.

36:19.443 --> 36:20.911
Really?

36:20.913 --> 36:23.413
Yep. When you have a problem,
it's good to...

36:23.415 --> 36:25.448
Stare it down.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.887
Well, we're gonna have to
end this now.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.255
So...

36:32.257 --> 36:35.392
Same time next week?

36:39.530 --> 36:40.730
(sighs deeply)

36:42.633 --> 36:45.302
Um...

36:45.304 --> 36:47.704
Next week's a little busy
for me, though.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.473
I'll let you know.

36:50.475 --> 36:52.275
Thank you, gav.

37:00.618 --> 37:01.818
(man) thanks.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.359
Hey.
Hey.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.494
They just finished
the biopsy.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.530
They say we should know within
a couple hours.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.433
Well, fingers crossed.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.867
He, uh...

37:17.869 --> 37:19.336
How's he holding up?

37:19.338 --> 37:21.471
Oh, he's doing great.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.606
I think
he's more worried about

37:22.608 --> 37:23.740
That astronaut
from the elevator

37:23.742 --> 37:25.575
Than he is about himself.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.911
Hey, uh...

37:27.913 --> 37:29.879
Did that guy, uh...

37:29.881 --> 37:31.314
Did he make it?

37:34.852 --> 37:36.519
Yeah.

37:38.322 --> 37:40.423
You can tell him
the astronaut made it.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.558
(exhales deeply)

37:41.560 --> 37:43.293
I--amazing. Thank you.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.929
Yeah. Good luck to you
and your family.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.365
I appreciate it.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.567
You all set?

37:50.569 --> 37:53.036
Hey, bud, guess what.

37:54.472 --> 38:00.710
â™ª

38:00.712 --> 38:05.682
(speaking inaudibly)

38:05.684 --> 38:08.785
She doesn't even know
that guy's name.

38:10.388 --> 38:11.521
(maggie) sad.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.058
A guy gets hit by a car,
it impacts everybody around him.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.393
Mm.

38:16.395 --> 38:20.730
It's a... Collision of souls,
really.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.733
That is beautiful, jackson.

38:23.735 --> 38:24.868
Yeah?

38:24.870 --> 38:26.002
Yeah.
I'm gonna write it down.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.338
Collision of souls.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.806
It's lovely.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.809
Hey!

38:34.445 --> 38:35.912
Booyah!

38:35.914 --> 38:37.013
That's cold.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.049
You can't guard against that,
son.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.417
Just gotta watch that happen.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.719
You've got a seriously
tiny little heart.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.921
Oh! Oh, do you want a replay?

38:47.391 --> 38:50.994
I hope you set your pvr,
because I'm walking away.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.338
Hey.
Hey.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.106
You're still here.
Yeah.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.742
Got pulled into something.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.610
Hey.

39:07.612 --> 39:10.580
You okay?

39:10.582 --> 39:13.616
When you're fighting to save
a person's life

39:13.618 --> 39:15.518
You know, and you're...
Exhausted

39:15.520 --> 39:16.920
And you're just doing everything
that you can.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.955
And all of a sudden,

39:18.957 --> 39:22.425
Your thoughts shoot forward,
like... In a flash.

39:22.427 --> 39:26.062
You know, to the--the first day,
maybe the next week.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.431
Some little chore
that you have to get through

39:28.433 --> 39:29.933
Or some little scene
that reminds you

39:29.935 --> 39:34.404
That life will go on
after they're gone.

39:34.406 --> 39:35.972
I used to think of that
as a weakness,

39:35.974 --> 39:39.042
Like I was giving up.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.878
And what do you think now?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.646
It's survival.

who don't know â™ª

40:45.209 --> 40:48.611
â™ª the spot

40:48.613 --> 40:51.481
