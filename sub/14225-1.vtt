00:45.671 --> 00:48.589
Especially your stock tips.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.134
So, are there any

00:50.135 --> 00:51.677
clothes in there,

00:48.590 --> 00:51.676
or is it all bribe money?

00:51.677 --> 00:53.366

00:53.367 --> 00:55.055
bribe anyone to do

I've decided to be

00:56.225 --> 00:57.390
more independent.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.602
Oh, great. Well, you can

00:59.603 --> 01:01.812
start by taking your

00:57.391 --> 01:01.811
own bag downstairs.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.730

in our cabin?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.333
I thought they fumigated it.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.043
It's my cabin now.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.461
Since I'm head counselor,

06:19.462 --> 06:21.006
Gladys told me I could

06:21.007 --> 06:22.549
transfer myself to

06:19.462 --> 06:22.548
Woodchuck Cabin.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.509
So Lou, you're now

the counselor of

06:22.549 --> 06:26.468
Weasel Cabin.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.054
- What?
- No!

06:28.057 --> 06:29.388
Why?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.578
I will not leave

06:30.579 --> 06:31.765
my Chucklets!

06:31.766 --> 06:33.685
- But, Hazel,
- you love Weasel Cabin!

06:33.688 --> 06:35.312
- You've always been
- a Weasel!

06:35.315 --> 06:36.563
- When you were born,
- the doctor said,

06:36.566 --> 06:38.023
"Congratulations,

06:38.024 --> 06:39.481
it's a Weasel!"

06:39.482 --> 06:40.941
Well, not anymore,

06:40.942 --> 06:42.173
because the new crop of

06:42.174 --> 06:43.402

07:16.811 --> 07:18.354
I'm athletic.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.357
You made me carry you here.

for the game!

Boom! I just scored

07:26.197 --> 07:28.239
another run,

and three new watches!

07:28.239 --> 07:31.033
Great job, Griff!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.682
When I said you could steal,

07:32.683 --> 07:34.328
I meant bases, not watches.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.477
Dude, you've got to

07:35.478 --> 07:36.622
give them back.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.000
But hurry up,

07:38.001 --> 07:39.376
because you're kicking

07:36.623 --> 07:39.375
for Jorge. He's injured.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.293
No, I'm not.

- I'll have Griff
- kick for you.

07:59.857 --> 08:02.170
No, I mean I fear that Griff

08:02.171 --> 08:04.484
may not be the best addition

07:59.854 --> 08:04.483

08:06.403 --> 08:09.822
but it's not his fault.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.015
so much room for her bed?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.392
Yeah, I always thought

08:37.393 --> 08:38.768
she slept in a coffin.

unstack our beds?

- He knows
- how much I love her.

He knew how much

and now his back pus

is all over it!

- after we went zip-lining,

out of my teeth.

- I saw my guitar,

between the strings.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.139
A-ha!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.808

14:52.809 --> 14:54.726
I say we strip search him!

14:54.727 --> 14:56.667
Dude, where exactly

14:56.668 --> 14:58.605
do you think I'm stashing it?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.629
I'm really disappointed

14:59.630 --> 15:00.649
in you, Griff.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.443
- I flipped a lot of burgers
- to buy Gabby.

15:02.446 --> 15:04.299
And it took a long time,

15:04.300 --> 15:06.155
'cause I kept flipped

15:02.443 --> 15:06.154
most of them on the floor.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.511
Xander, I did not

15:07.512 --> 15:08.865
take the guitar!

15:20.234 --> 15:21.379

by the camp fire.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.589
You know, we really

15:22.590 --> 15:23.798
should change that name.

16:19.334 --> 16:20.688
everyone thinks

16:17.977 --> 16:20.687
I stole that guitar!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.481
Well...

16:22.482 --> 16:23.921
Your resume does include...

16:23.922 --> 16:25.359
How shall I put it...

16:22.482 --> 16:25.359
Stealing.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.695
So that automatically

16:27.696 --> 16:28.820
makes me a thief?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.363
Well...

16:30.364 --> 16:31.637
Technically...

16:31.638 --> 16:32.909
And legally... Yes.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.558
If I may ask,

16:36.559 --> 16:38.956
why did you

16:34.160 --> 16:38.955
start stealing things?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.208
(SIGHS) I don't know.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.731
When I was growing up,

16:42.732 --> 16:44.253
there wasn't always

16:41.209 --> 16:44.252
enough food,

16:44.253 --> 16:45.651
so I borrowed some

16:45.652 --> 16:47.047
from the grocery store.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.256
Oh...

16:48.257 --> 16:50.218
- So, you were just
- trying to survive?

16:50.221 --> 16:52.052
Exactly.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.265
But they put me in juvie

16:55.266 --> 16:58.476
after I borrowed a skateboard,

16:52.053 --> 16:58.475
a TV, a motorcycle...

16:58.476 --> 17:00.249
You are really playing

17:00.250 --> 17:02.021
fast and loose

16:58.476 --> 17:02.020
with the word "borrow".

17:02.021 --> 17:03.482
Hey, you don't

17:03.483 --> 17:04.940
get to judge me!

17:04.941 --> 17:06.858
- You have no idea
- what I've been through,

17:06.862 --> 17:07.923
What it's like to have

17:07.924 --> 17:08.986
your parents abandon you.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.804
Actually, I lived in

17:13.805 --> 17:17.118
an orphanage in India

17:10.488 --> 17:17.118
until I was 10.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.704
So...

17:19.704 --> 17:21.915
I do know what it is like

17:21.916 --> 17:24.125
to be poor, and feel unwanted.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.669
So you weren't always rich?

17:25.670 --> 17:26.962
No.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.757
But, unlike you,

17:30.758 --> 17:32.842
I never resorted to stealing.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.783
Okay, I know I haven't made

17:34.784 --> 17:36.721
the best choices in the past,

17:36.722 --> 17:38.516
but I was really hoping

17:38.517 --> 17:40.308
to put that all behind me.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.977
I understand.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.417
I have made mistakes

17:43.418 --> 17:44.855
in my past

17:41.978 --> 17:44.854
I wish I could take back.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.064
Really?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.066
You've been arrested?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.256
No, but I was once

17:49.257 --> 17:50.444
penalized with quite

17:48.067 --> 17:50.444
a hefty library fine.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.364
You're pretty hardcore, Rav.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.075
- That is also
- what the librarian said.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.994
Huh.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.184
Who would have thought

18:00.185 --> 18:01.372
you and I would have

17:58.995 --> 18:01.371
so much in common?

18:01.372 --> 18:03.039
I know.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.333
- It's too bad they're gonna
- kick me out,

18:04.336 --> 18:05.689
Because I was really starting

18:05.690 --> 18:07.044
to like it here,

18:08.254 --> 18:11.215
even you and your dumb face.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.802
Sorry, still working

18:13.803 --> 18:14.969
on my people skills.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.725
Reek, heel!

18:21.809 --> 18:22.893
Sit!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.586
You can do

18:27.587 --> 18:28.898
your stupid judge thing,

18:28.899 --> 18:30.527
but you better be back

18:30.528 --> 18:32.152
in half an hour.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.946
The hole will be dug by then.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.952
What's the hole for?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.287
For me...

18:42.288 --> 18:43.789
And the snakes.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.208
- Are you aware - there's a rat
- On your shoulder?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.837
Yep.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.778
At first he was scared of me,

18:52.779 --> 18:54.716
but now we're besties.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.157
I finally found someone

18:56.158 --> 18:57.595
who gets me.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.994
So, judges,

19:00.995 --> 19:02.099
let's get this started.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.062
Hear me, hear me!

19:06.063 --> 19:08.104
Let the trial begin!

19:08.105 --> 19:10.567
Griff, you stand accused

19:10.568 --> 19:13.027
of stealing Gabby the guitar,

19:08.105 --> 19:13.026
which you obviously did.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.112
Do you have anything

19:14.113 --> 19:15.195
to say in your defense?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.677
What's the point?

19:16.678 --> 19:18.157
You all think

19:15.196 --> 19:18.156
I'm guilty anyway.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.617
- Griff, if you won't
- defend yourself,

19:19.620 --> 19:21.202
- Then we have no choice...
- Wait!

19:24.121 --> 19:26.082
Distinguished judges,

19:26.083 --> 19:28.042
counselors, Hazel's rat...

19:29.794 --> 19:31.150
I know Griff has

19:31.151 --> 19:32.504
a checkered past.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.756
In fact, he has

19:33.757 --> 19:35.006
a long history of theft,

19:35.007 --> 19:36.363
including watches,

19:36.364 --> 19:37.717
a skateboard, a motorcycle,

19:37.718 --> 19:38.990
which he clearly was

19:38.991 --> 19:40.261
not licensed to operate...

19:40.262 --> 19:42.013
Dude, what are you doing?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.098
I'm defending you.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.141
Not very well!

19:45.142 --> 19:46.436
You're worse than

19:46.437 --> 19:47.727
my last public defender.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.563
- And I found him
- on a bus bench.

19:49.566 --> 19:51.065
- Oh, he was advertising
- on a bus bench?

19:51.068 --> 19:53.150
No, he was sleeping on it.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.611
Anyhoo...

19:56.612 --> 19:59.280
What is a criminal?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.263
The word is derived

20:01.264 --> 20:03.244
from the Latin word,

19:59.281 --> 20:03.243
criminalis, which means...

20:03.244 --> 20:04.662
Can we kick Ravi

20:04.663 --> 20:06.079
out of camp, too?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.644
If he doesn't get

20:07.645 --> 20:09.207
to the point quick, yes.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.253
My point is, Griff came

20:12.254 --> 20:15.297
to Camp Kikiwaka hoping

20:09.208 --> 20:15.296
for a fresh start.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.196
More than anything,

20:17.197 --> 20:19.093
he just wanted to be

20:15.297 --> 20:19.092
part of a family.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.720
And he was starting

20:20.721 --> 20:22.345
to find that here, with us.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.036
I do not believe he would do

20:24.037 --> 20:25.724
anything to jeopardize that.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.414
Ergo, he did not

20:27.415 --> 20:29.103
steal Xander's guitar.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.480
Thanks, Ravi.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.817
Nobody's ever stuck up

20:33.818 --> 20:35.150
for me like that before.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.485
Or used the word "ergo".

20:38.154 --> 20:39.654
Who cares?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.239
He's guilty!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.200
- Throw him in the hole
- with Lou and the snakes!

20:44.493 --> 20:46.077
Hold on.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.142
If Griff didn't

20:47.143 --> 20:48.205
take my guitar,

20:46.078 --> 20:48.204
then who did?

20:48.205 --> 20:49.666
(DOOR SLAMS)

20:49.667 --> 20:51.124
Wait, don't cook that camper!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.169
We're not!

20:53.170 --> 20:55.212
It's just a barbecue

20:51.125 --> 20:55.211
for afterwards!

20:55.212 --> 20:57.444
I told the girls

20:57.445 --> 20:59.675
about Xander's missing guitar,

20:55.212 --> 20:59.674
and they found it!

20:59.675 --> 21:01.843
It was under Hazel's bed!

21:01.844 --> 21:03.178
(GASPS)

21:03.179 --> 21:04.618
Yeah, we found it when we were

21:04.619 --> 21:06.056
planting explos...

21:07.266 --> 21:09.351
I mean, cleaning up.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.417
Hazel! You took

21:12.418 --> 21:13.938
Xander's guitar?

21:13.939 --> 21:16.296
She looks guiltier than I did

21:16.297 --> 21:18.652
when I finally returned

21:13.939 --> 21:18.651
that library book!

21:18.652 --> 21:21.072
Okay, okay, I took

21:21.073 --> 21:23.490
Xander's stupid guitar.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.826
How dare you love Gabby

21:24.827 --> 21:26.159
more than you love me!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.786
I don't love you at all!

21:27.787 --> 21:29.329
Body-pillow Xander does!

21:29.330 --> 21:30.352
And he doesn't mind

21:30.353 --> 21:31.372
when I drool on him!

21:31.373 --> 21:32.416
ALL: Ew!

21:34.335 --> 21:36.963
Look, Griff, I am really sorry

21:36.964 --> 21:39.589
I didn't believe you.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.884
You're a good kid,

21:40.885 --> 21:42.176
and if you still want

21:39.590 --> 21:42.176
to stay at camp,

21:43.344 --> 21:44.492
I'd be proud to have you

21:44.493 --> 21:45.637
as a Grizzly.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.806
That'd be cool, man.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.601
I'm really glad

21:49.602 --> 21:50.809
you're staying, dude...

21:50.810 --> 21:52.916
But if you touch

21:52.917 --> 21:55.022
my hair curlers,

21:50.810 --> 21:55.021
it's go time.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.232
I'll try to restrain myself.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.736
Okay, guys, let us

21:59.737 --> 22:02.238
celebrate by giving Griff

21:57.233 --> 22:02.238
a big Grizzly Cabin bear hug!

22:06.200 --> 22:07.283
Hazel!

22:07.284 --> 22:08.827
How does she do that?

22:08.828 --> 22:09.871
Release!

22:09.872 --> 22:10.912
Never!

22:10.913 --> 22:12.581
- Emma, go get
- your pepper spray.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.068
Oh! It's so great to have

22:19.069 --> 22:20.672
everything back to normal.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.215
Welcome home, Woody!

22:22.216 --> 22:23.457
- (IN DEEP VOICE)
- Thanks, Lou.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.929
Well, as normal

22:25.930 --> 22:27.262
as it gets around here.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.972
We're glad you're back, Lou.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.078
Yup, right where I belong.

22:30.079 --> 22:31.183
Up to my cheeks in Chucks!

22:33.310 --> 22:34.477
Hey, whose ribbon is that?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.771
Don't touch that!

22:37.940 --> 22:39.148
Hey!

22:39.149 --> 22:41.317
Where's all my stuff?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.882
Sorry, Hazel, but you're

22:42.883 --> 22:44.446
back in Weasel Cabin.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.445
Effective immediately.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.823
What?

22:45.824 --> 22:47.198
You can't make me move!

22:47.199 --> 22:48.409
Sure we can.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.618
Unless you want us

22:47.199 --> 22:49.617
to tell Gladys

22:49.618 --> 22:50.870
you stole

22:50.871 --> 22:52.121
another counselor's

22:49.618 --> 22:52.120
property...

22:52.121 --> 22:53.352
And framed

22:53.353 --> 22:54.581
an innocent camper.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.291
Okay, you can make me.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.709
But this isn't over.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.420
You haven't seen

22:59.421 --> 23:01.130
the last of Hazel Swearengen!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.633
Uh-oh. (SCREAMS)

23:07.052 --> 23:08.261
Those Weasels are freaks,

23:08.262 --> 23:09.513
but their timing

23:09.514 --> 23:10.763
is impeccable.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.015
Woodchuck salute?

23:12.016 --> 23:13.683
(ALL CHITTERING)

23:13.684 --> 23:15.457
Hey, Tiffany, show them

23:15.458 --> 23:17.229
the cab driver salute

23:13.684 --> 23:17.228
I taught you.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.273
Okay!

23:18.274 --> 23:19.315
No, no, no, no.
