{\an8}But I had a great time,
honestly,

08:14.026 --> 08:15.494
{\an8}that was one of my
best birthdays yet.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.897
I had a conversation with
Madisson yesterday that...

08:17.964 --> 08:19.165
I'm not really sure--
- About what?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.200
- She doesn't think that
you're into me

08:21.267 --> 08:24.904
for the right intentions,
and she was also saying

08:24.971 --> 08:27.039
me and you are sort of
plain in her face.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.141
- That's such bull [bleep].

08:29.208 --> 08:30.443
- BRANDON: I mean,
that's what I'm saying.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.510
- She's with Ish,
why does she give a [bleep]?

08:32.578 --> 08:34.447
- At the end of the day,
I don't wanna cause more

08:34.513 --> 08:36.381
drama than there already is--
- You're not causing it, she is.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.484
- She is, I know.
- She's talking [bleep] about me

08:38.551 --> 08:41.120
to you, which is not cool.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.089
- To be honest, I just think
Madisson's just being, like,

08:43.155 --> 08:46.125
a little jealous.
- JARED: Yeah.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.694
- AMANDA: Where was your woman?
- Still in the treehouse?

08:48.761 --> 08:50.296
- AMANDA: He left her up there?
- Kelsey!

08:50.363 --> 08:51.197
{\an8}- [laughs]

08:53.199 --> 08:54.200
{\an8}- What's going on with that?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.701
Are you guys just, like,
hooking up?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.203
Serious? What do you want?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.571
- I mean, I'm trying
to make it serious.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.073
- BRANDON: I think you got her
this time, bro, for sure.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.142
- I don't know if she's the one,
but she definitely could be.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.846
- When I went four-wheeling
with him, I had a ton of fun.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.481
We do have a chemistry,
but the thing is,

09:08.547 --> 09:10.316
I also did just get out
of a relationship,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.818
so we'll see, I'm a little
worried about that.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.420
- Yeah, don't lead him on
too much.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.922
- Yeah, well...

09:18.190 --> 09:20.259
- ♪ You try, try to catch me ♪

09:20.326 --> 09:23.829
♪ But too late,

09:23.896 --> 09:26.165

09:30.002 --> 09:31.504

- Good.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.538
- JULIETTE: Okay, so,

09:32.605 --> 09:34.407
I know it's probably
not the best look

09:34.473 --> 09:37.243
to ask for time off
when I've barely started work,

09:37.310 --> 09:40.112
but, like, you guys,
it's Greece.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.447
Thanks for meeting me.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.716
- Yeah, I'm actually really glad
that you suggested

09:43.783 --> 09:46.118
that we meet today.
- Yeah.

09:46.185 --> 09:49.055
I think we need to...
talk about some stuff.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.658
- Yeah. I heard that you
punched someone out.

09:52.725 --> 09:56.762
- ♪

09:56.829 --> 09:58.264
- That is true.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.966
I'm not proud
of my actions at all,

10:00.032 --> 10:01.634
and I'm really sorry
that it got that way--

10:01.701 --> 10:04.603
- You can understand how
I'm kind of apprehensive.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.472
It just looks bad on the store,

10:06.539 --> 10:09.475
and we live in a small enough
town that, I mean--

10:09.542 --> 10:12.078
- JULIETTE: Word travels fast.
- Word has already traveled.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.214
So is that going to drive
business and customers away

10:15.281 --> 10:18.951
because I have you working
and they won't come in

10:19.018 --> 10:20.319
when you're working?

10:20.386 --> 10:23.189
You're not in college anymore,
like...this is maturity.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.225
This is a real job,
I need you to treat it that way.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.394
- And it will never ever
happen again,

10:28.461 --> 10:32.098
it definitely will never
happen anywhere near Blend.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.133
- I'm happy to know that--
moving forward that this isn't

10:34.200 --> 10:38.170
gonna be a situation again.
- I promise. Promise.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.906
- So, with the store opening,
we're probably gonna have

10:40.973 --> 10:44.477
close to...I don't know,
150 boxes of clothes,

10:44.543 --> 10:47.380
they're gonna all need
to be steamed, ready to go, so--

10:47.446 --> 10:50.549
- There's actually something
I wanted to talk about.

10:50.616 --> 10:51.817
- Okay.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.219
- Um...

10:54.253 --> 10:58.624
Robby got me...a trip to Greece

10:58.691 --> 11:01.227
for my graduation present.

11:01.293 --> 11:04.363
And he scheduled it
for next week.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.867
- Like, I hope you told him no.

11:07.933 --> 11:12.038
- Um...yeah, I kinda
didn't know what to say.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.106
So I've been talking to him
about it and he was like,

11:14.173 --> 11:17.143
"These are non-refundable..."

11:17.209 --> 11:19.812
Um, is there anything I can do
while I'm there?

11:19.879 --> 11:22.248
- In Greece?
- I will have WiFi there.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.116
- You're in a completely
different timezone.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.253
- I will be happy to bring
clothes from the store

11:27.319 --> 11:30.790
for Robby and I to wear,
we can post on Instagram,

11:30.856 --> 11:32.958
get some...you know, awareness.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.927
- So, the answer's no.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.462
This is a business, Juliette.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.399
And you haven't even really
started that much work

11:40.466 --> 11:43.335
and you're already asking
for days off.

11:43.402 --> 11:47.139
I'm actually really
taken aback that you even asked.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.009
- Great.
- You really need to figure out

11:50.076 --> 11:51.644
what's more important to you.
You know?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.346
Is it gonna be your career
or is it gonna be

11:54.413 --> 11:57.616
going on this vacation
with your boyfriend?

12:00.352 --> 12:02.655
{\an8}- Seems like you're just
getting a little bit jealous.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.990
- What do I do?
- I don't want to tell you

12:05.057 --> 12:06.992
to get down on your knees
and beg, but...

12:07.059 --> 12:08.928
- I know for a fact
you cheated on Garrett,

12:08.994 --> 12:10.229
but it's okay.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.098
- CARA: What the [bleep]
are you talking about?!

12:12.164 --> 12:13.365
Spit it out!

12:16.836 --> 12:19.872
- ♪ You know we're living
the life ♪

12:19.939 --> 12:23.309
{\an8}♪ You know we're living

12:23.375 --> 12:25.511
{\an8}- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.646
{\an8}Welcome to the famous
Crescent Club,

12:27.713 --> 12:29.982
{\an8}established in 1949.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.017
{\an8}- I cannot believe
you bought this place.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.153
- Well, when the opportunity
came, I jumped on it,

12:34.220 --> 12:35.187
because I love this place,

12:35.254 --> 12:37.323
I was coming here
when I was your age.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.958
After you.
- CHLOE: Thank you.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.761
- GARY: Believe it or not,
just for this little dump,

12:42.828 --> 12:44.830
I paid over three million
dollars, okay?

12:44.897 --> 12:46.999
Basically, we have to double
the revenue in this place, okay?

12:47.066 --> 12:48.901
Now, you have some ideas
on doing that?

12:48.968 --> 12:50.669
{\an8}- I feel like the drinks
are a little too cheap.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.072
{\an8}Like, we're selling a lot.
- You cannot change the pricing.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.607
- Alright, well, that's why
I got Chloe here,

12:54.673 --> 12:56.609
because she knows how
to run a bar.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.644
- I just think, of course
the locals know

12:58.711 --> 13:00.179
about this place,
but these tourists

13:00.246 --> 13:02.381
that have never came
to Siesta Key before, you know,

13:02.448 --> 13:05.017
they're walking up and down
and there's nothing up front--

13:05.084 --> 13:06.552
- No curb appeal.
- CHLOE: Exactly.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.953
- Okay.
- Set some cables out there,

13:08.020 --> 13:10.856
some TVs, but I also think
if we create, like,

13:10.923 --> 13:14.460
a specialty cocktail menu,
some Blue Lagoon, like,

13:14.527 --> 13:15.728
Mai Thai type of drinks.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.229
- Yeah, you got the local guy,

13:17.296 --> 13:18.397
and then you got
the tourist guy.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.899
- Yeah, you have to cater
to both.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.667
- Right, okay, now listen,
you sure this is

13:21.734 --> 13:23.002
a good partnership
between you two?

13:23.068 --> 13:25.471
The last time I saw you guys
together is when I was

13:25.538 --> 13:27.239
looking out the window
and you were screaming

13:27.306 --> 13:28.908
at each other top of your lungs.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.910
{\an8}- I'm talking!
- This is exactly why

13:30.976 --> 13:32.444
{\an8}I don't ever wanna be
your friend.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.846
{\an8}- You're not ending
this friendship,

13:33.913 --> 13:35.281
{\an8}I'm ending this friendship.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.149
{\an8}I want nothing to do
with you.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.590
I mean, I think we were just
really on the wrong page

13:44.657 --> 13:47.726
of things but we've always
respected each other,

13:47.793 --> 13:49.228
and business is business.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.430
- Alright, well, Alex,
you know, you too, guys,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.232
I mean, let's do it, right?
[laughs]

13:53.299 --> 13:54.867
- Where are you going?
- Gotta go to Tampa,

13:54.934 --> 13:57.102
I got a lot of meetings.
Congratulations, you two.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.604
Don't kill each other.
- ALEX: See ya.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.906
- CHLOE: [laughs]
"Don't kill each other."

14:00.973 --> 14:03.842
I cannot get over the fact
that your dad bought this place.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.878
- This place is gonna pop.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.379
It's gonna be hard
not to fight,

14:07.446 --> 14:08.814
'cause I know
how me and you are,

14:08.881 --> 14:11.150
but honestly, you're gonna have
most of the responsibility.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.485
- Then you're pretty much
the owner and I'm your manager.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.054
- Yeah, exactly.
- Which means you sit

14:15.120 --> 14:17.289
on your ass and do nothing,
and I do all the work

14:17.356 --> 14:19.692
and you take credit for it.
- No, the less I interfere,

14:19.758 --> 14:22.861
probably the better.
- Yeah.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.630
- Yeah.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.632
- Yeah. I'm excited
for tomorrow.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.702
We haven't gone on the boat
in forever!

14:29.768 --> 14:32.638
- I know, I'm pretty excited
for Cara to come tomorrow.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.308
- Oh, here we go.
- She told me she's single, so.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.012
- Juliette's gonna love it.
- I mean, at this point, like,

14:40.079 --> 14:42.648
I don't care how Juliette feels
about it because

14:42.715 --> 14:44.750
she's going to Greece
with someone else.

14:44.817 --> 14:45.851
- I don't know, I feel like

14:45.918 --> 14:48.053
Juliette's absolutely
delusional.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.889
- How does he even plan to
pay for it? That's not cheap.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.892
- I think Robby's using, like,
his Rebella stuff

14:53.959 --> 14:56.762
to get, like, free hotels
and free dinners,

14:56.829 --> 14:59.064
so like, they'll just post
on Instagram, like,

14:59.131 --> 15:01.333
where they're staying and
everything that they're doing.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.501
- That sounds delightful,

15:02.568 --> 15:04.436
having to work your whole
vacation.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.672
- He's gonna be like,
"Juliette, go stand over there

15:06.739 --> 15:09.275
so I can take a picture
of you and tag the hotel."

15:09.341 --> 15:11.844
- Anyone can see that Robby's
using her, we all can see it.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.480
- Oh, he's a con artist.

{\an8}How do you choose between
your new career

15:25.491 --> 15:27.493

{\an8}It's not as simple as it looks.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.597

about Greece.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.600

15:34.667 --> 15:36.669

17:06.258 --> 17:07.792
If I want something bad enough

17:07.859 --> 17:11.130
I'll do anything and everything
to make it happen,

17:11.195 --> 17:12.964
and I really wanna go to Greece.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.234
{\an8}This is the fun stuff
right here.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.002
{\an8}- The non-fun part is
the amount of work

17:18.069 --> 17:20.973
{\an8}that has to be done in order
to get this thing open.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.608
{\an8}You know, over there,
they're finishing the flooring,

17:22.674 --> 17:26.211
{\an8}the bar, all that's kind of
just all coming together.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.012
I'm just so happy that you
canceled the Greek plans

17:28.079 --> 17:29.915
and that all that's, like,
done with and you made this

17:29.982 --> 17:33.152
a priority and...we're kind of
moving forward.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.319
- Um...

17:36.955 --> 17:38.924
About that.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.659
I've been talking to Robby

17:40.726 --> 17:45.931
and he was really upset
that you didn't want me

17:45.998 --> 17:48.700
to go on this trip and I--
I explained to him, you know,

17:48.767 --> 17:52.604
this is my job, and he basically
explained that plane tickets

17:52.671 --> 17:56.675
and the hotel is all
non-refundable.

17:56.742 --> 18:01.079
So I haven't, uh...
haven't yet canceled

18:01.146 --> 18:04.783
the trip to Greece.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.419
Obviously, I don't wanna
lose this job,

18:07.486 --> 18:10.622
I just really wanna go,
and I don't wanna disappoint him

18:10.689 --> 18:12.991
and I don't wanna disappoint
you either.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.895
I just--I'm trying to find
what's the best thing I can do

18:16.962 --> 18:19.865
to please both sides.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.267
But you--I mean...

18:22.334 --> 18:24.570
it's just like,
a once in a lifetime trip and--

18:24.636 --> 18:28.273
- I get it, but this is
my once-in-a-lifetime opening.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.909
- Yeah.
- This is a real job.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.412
And that's a vacation.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.214
And obviously you know
that I see potential in you,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.282
or I wouldn't have hired you.

18:37.349 --> 18:40.285
But at the end of the day,
you going to Greece--

18:40.352 --> 18:42.454
you may not have a job
when you come back.

What is that? Looks good.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.013
- That is a very strong
jalapeño margarita.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.516
- MADISSON: Oh, perfect!
Can I get the same thing as her?

19:10.582 --> 19:13.719
That looks really good.
- It's spicy. Like me.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.888

- BOTH: [giggling]

19:15.954 --> 19:18.257
- JULIETTE: For someone who's
supposedly really smart,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.526
Madisson is acting
pretty naive.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.794
- Are you and Amanda...?

19:22.861 --> 19:25.531
I know she has played you
in the past, has she not?

19:25.597 --> 19:28.367
- I don't know why you have
an opinion right now.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.168
- JULIETTE: Now she's on
Amanda's bad side,

19:30.235 --> 19:31.603
which is never good.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.206
- AMANDA: So, what's up?
- [sighs] Not a lot.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.708
How are you?
- I, um...

19:36.775 --> 19:38.777
kind of have a bone
to pick with you.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.650
- What's going on?

19:44.716 --> 19:47.519
- I talked to BG recently.

19:47.586 --> 19:51.924
And he told me that you said
I have bad intentions.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.330
- I didn't mean them as
a personal attack, like,

19:58.397 --> 20:01.333
I mean, I get that,
first of all, but like,

20:01.400 --> 20:03.268
as a friend, you're great,

20:03.335 --> 20:07.406
and as, like, a hook-up,
you're great.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.374
- AMANDA: I'm a hook-up.
- No, like, I mean like,

20:09.441 --> 20:11.376
you don't really do
relationships.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.211
- So are you saying I'm not
dating material?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.514
- I'm not--sorry, I didn't
mean it to sound like that.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.116
- Because I could've had BG
if I wanted him,

20:18.183 --> 20:20.852
and before you, too.
- I know, and that's a lot of

20:20.919 --> 20:24.122
the reason why I am skeptical,
because I do know

20:24.189 --> 20:28.060
of your past with Brandon,
'cause I dated him shortly after

20:28.126 --> 20:29.895
you guys had your fling.

20:29.962 --> 20:33.365
{\an8}- I think that we click.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.535
Just not
on that level right now.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.971
I just don't know why
you're worried about

20:39.037 --> 20:40.238
me and Brandon.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.740
Seems like you're just
getting a little bit jealous

20:41.807 --> 20:45.377
with him and it's...kind
of concerning for me.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.845
- I'm not jealous,
I love Ish

20:46.912 --> 20:50.015
and I'm really, really
happy where we are.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.986
But we have not had
the best start to the summer,

20:54.052 --> 20:56.655
and I...

20:58.357 --> 20:59.958
like, we're having
tough times,

21:00.025 --> 21:03.462
but that doesn't mean
I don't love him.

21:07.399 --> 21:10.502
Like, I'm incredibly
happy with him,

21:10.569 --> 21:12.738
I'm just sad that he's gone.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.708
- I get your concerns,
but I feel like I've been

21:16.775 --> 21:18.644
really upfront and honest
with Brandon,

21:18.710 --> 21:21.113
'cause BG and I have been
friends for how long?

21:21.179 --> 21:22.948
And I don't want to hurt him.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.349
- You're right,
it wasn't the right time

21:24.416 --> 21:26.018
and it wasn't even my place
at all,

21:26.084 --> 21:27.519
I should've never said it.

I'm taking that.
- I got the bananas for you.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.213
You must be exhausted.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.985

Robby wanted to surprise me

22:00.052 --> 22:01.286
with a trip to Greece.

22:01.353 --> 22:04.890
- Oh, wow, sounds like
a great romantic trip, Juliette.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.626
- I know, but--
- It's a little fast, isn't it?

22:07.693 --> 22:09.795
- JULIETTE: I mean,
everyone said that, but...

22:09.861 --> 22:12.431
it's not like we're
planning our wedding.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.899
- I guess we'll have to meet.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.601
- Yeah, eventually you'll
meet him, don't worry.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.804
We'll set that up.
- Dad is wondering too.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.807
- Can everyone slow down?
- [laughs]

22:21.873 --> 22:24.609
- Please? Give me a second.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.880
- Okay, well, I guess
it's fast for you, too. I agree.

22:28.947 --> 22:32.317
So, and how did you get
time off from work already?

22:32.384 --> 22:35.153
- Um, that was kind of an issue.

22:35.220 --> 22:39.491
Courtney wasn't really happy
about it, but Robby, like,

22:39.558 --> 22:42.260
got the ticket and...
we couldn't exchange it.

22:42.327 --> 22:44.796
- Yeah.
- So...I don't know.

22:44.863 --> 22:49.668
- Well, you know, um,
I'm not...happy to see you

22:49.735 --> 22:52.637
in this situation.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.308
I understand that you want to,
but you can't.

22:56.374 --> 22:59.244
Work is your total
responsibility.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.814
- But--I don't know, I like--
I--I can't not go,

23:02.881 --> 23:05.684
I already got him
to cut it in half, I'm going.

boyfriend, Ish,

23:42.187 --> 23:44.389
has been in Canada for work
all summer.

23:44.456 --> 23:47.292
And Madisson has been
a mess lately.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.461
Guess that's why
you shouldn't do long distance.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.797
{\an8}- I don't want you to leave.
- I gotta go work.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.832

- MADISSON: I'm okay.
- What's wrong?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.443
- I just miss you a lot
and it's just...

24:05.510 --> 24:07.879
- I miss you too, but,
you know, like...

24:07.946 --> 24:09.347
- Yeah.
- ISH: We knew that this

24:09.414 --> 24:11.783
was gonna be the case,
and I was gonna come up here,

24:11.850 --> 24:13.552
I am working.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.187
- I just feel like when I was
in LA

24:15.253 --> 24:17.389
I was so focused and
I had you, like, there,

24:17.455 --> 24:20.892
encouraging me and it's just,
now I don't have you and--

24:20.959 --> 24:22.394
- What do you mean,
you don't have me?

24:22.460 --> 24:26.198
- I mean, I don't physically
have you here, and it's hard.

24:26.264 --> 24:30.035
- Yeah, but you still have me.
- I had a conversation

24:30.101 --> 24:32.270
with my dad.
- Does he miss me?

24:32.337 --> 24:33.972
{\an8}- [laughs] It actually, like,

24:34.039 --> 24:38.343
{\an8}it--I mean, he was really,
really kind.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.912
{\an8}- JON: Ish is certainly
a nice guy.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.748
His greatest crime
in my eyes

24:43.815 --> 24:46.084
is that he likes my daughter.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.721
But if you seek my blessing,
I'm not there.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.557
- He said you were really cool,
just not cool for me.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.727
- [laughs] Well, I mean,
I guess that's kind of

24:55.794 --> 24:59.297

- He likes you. Okay.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.800

So I know it's a gamble to go,

of Siesta Key,

25:44.242 --> 25:45.243

25:45.310 --> 25:46.578

cool with everything?

cool with it.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.284
Feel like I'm already
letting her down, but...

25:52.350 --> 25:55.120

Are you excited?

25:55.186 --> 25:57.889
- I'm so excited.
It's just, with fighting

25:57.956 --> 26:01.860
with Chloe and Amanda,
you know, it's kind of a bummer.

26:01.927 --> 26:05.463
- You think those friendships
are worth repairing?

26:05.530 --> 26:08.099
- I really don't know,
'cause I've been here before--

26:08.166 --> 26:10.235
- You want my opinion?
I think no.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.503
They're obviously toxic.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.772
I do think repairing
the friendships,

26:13.838 --> 26:15.941
both of them will come
back to bite you in the ass.

26:16.007 --> 26:20.045
- Any relationship is a lot
easier said than done, I think.

26:20.111 --> 26:23.181
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I have to figure that out.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.383
Not today, though.
[laughs] Not today.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.704
{\an8}- Yeah, since last summer.
- Yeah.

27:19.771 --> 27:22.240
- I hit up JJ, he's gonna
bring his boat out and come.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.143
- You invited who?
- JARED: JJ.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.478
- Why?
- You know JJ.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.413
{\an8}- Who's JJ?
- CHLOE: Amanda--

27:28.480 --> 27:30.515
{\an8}her ex boyfriend,
you've heard her, like,

27:30.582 --> 27:32.984
talk about, like, the guy
that, like, broke her heart

27:33.051 --> 27:34.319
and all that.
- This is the guy?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.620
- CHLOE: That's him, yeah.

27:35.687 --> 27:38.590
- My ex of three years, JJ,
why would you invite him?

27:38.656 --> 27:39.824
- JARED:
I think it will be fine.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.260
I think everyone here is exes
anyway, but...

27:42.327 --> 27:43.962
- Just throw another ex
and see what happens.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.564
- One more ex into the group,
it should be totally fine.

27:46.631 --> 27:48.400
- It's all good.
- Alright, Madisson's coming too

27:48.466 --> 27:50.668
so it's just gonna be
boats and exes.

27:50.735 --> 27:51.803
- Let's just see what happens.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.405

see how that goes.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.510

is Amanda's ex.

28:39.984 --> 28:42.320
He was horrible to her
when they dated.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.458
Like, he was basically Alex,
but with more tattoos.

28:46.524 --> 28:50.395
He's super hot, super rich,
and can be a super jerk.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.098
I know Amanda never really
got over him.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.033
- He put me through the ringer.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.202
He cheated on me
a bunch of times.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.839
We were young, dumb,
and in love, so...

29:00.905 --> 29:02.841
a lot's changed and I haven't
seen him in a while,

29:02.907 --> 29:04.642
so it's gonna be hard.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.078
I'm just being real with you
'cause I don't wanna be like,

29:07.145 --> 29:09.347
"Oh, no, he doesn't faze me
at all," like, that's not true.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.849
I don't have feelings for him,
but, like,

29:10.915 --> 29:12.884
I'll always have love for him.

{\an8}- Yeah, trying not to get

29:19.591 --> 29:21.593
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Me and JJ have been

29:21.659 --> 29:23.128
{\an8}on the boat, like, all week, so.

29:23.194 --> 29:24.762
{\an8}- You and JJ seem
pretty close.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.164

29:31.369 --> 29:32.871
I give 'em the benefit

29:32.937 --> 29:35.340
- That's what you say.

29:35.406 --> 29:38.109
{\an8}- So, we're back on the boat.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.778

where we left off. [laughs]

29:40.845 --> 29:44.182
- Just calm down. [laughs]
Oh, God.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.550
- It's cold out,
we couldn't have done this

29:45.617 --> 29:48.820
last summer, and now it's like--
- You couldn't do anything

29:48.887 --> 29:51.022
last summer.
Are you happier now or--?

29:51.089 --> 29:53.057
- Dude, I am so much happier.
- Oh, really?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.393
- Like, night-and-day different.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.398
So, I think it's about time
you learn how to drive my boat.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.368
- Learn? Oh, Alex, you don't
have to teach me, honey.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.870
- See? I'll move out--
- I've grown up on boats, okay?

30:05.937 --> 30:08.406
This is, like, my tender.
- Oh, a tender.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.476
- A tender to my bigger boat.
- Oh, my God.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.945
Well, if you're that rich,
then you must've had a captain.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.648
- No, I was good enough
on my own.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.016
- Oh.
- I know all these things.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.185
- Wow.
- I know them already, okay?

30:20.251 --> 30:21.986
I'm not Kelsey,
I graduated from high school.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.055
- Oh, shots at Kelsey.
- Yeah.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.692
- I just feel bad, like,

30:27.759 --> 30:29.060
after seeing
Garrett the other day,

30:29.127 --> 30:31.596
he's so...down about things
and then she's over here

30:31.663 --> 30:34.499
just having fun and drinking
and hanging out with Alex

30:34.566 --> 30:35.867
on his boat.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.735
- I bet you're, uh, ecstatic
that she's gonna be

30:37.802 --> 30:40.138
out here today.
- Yeah, she's, um...

30:40.205 --> 30:42.874
she's just not my type
of gal, you know?

30:42.941 --> 30:44.576
Like, that was cute when
we were on eighth grade

30:44.642 --> 30:47.111
to be, like, the dumb blonde,
like, that's not cute anymore.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.947
- ALEX: You played the dumb
blonde card pretty well

30:49.013 --> 30:50.181
in college.
- Did I?

30:50.248 --> 30:51.416
- ALEX: Are you kidding me?

30:51.482 --> 30:53.551
You were cheating off
everyone's exams.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.186
- I know, but that's--
- Asking me for help

30:55.253 --> 30:56.854
with your homework.
- Listen, that's called

30:56.921 --> 30:59.324
strategy, okay?

30:59.390 --> 31:02.961
- Like, if Garrett saw that,
it'd really piss him off.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.230
I swear, like, if I see her,
like, all over him

31:05.296 --> 31:08.166
and flirty and stuff,
I'd just really be mad for him.

31:08.233 --> 31:11.169
- Didn't I write your paper,
though? I swear I did.

31:11.236 --> 31:12.937

35:30.628 --> 35:33.297
- Yeah, guess you will.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.733
- Especially if he's around you.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.502
- Uh, he will be.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.904
- ♪

35:39.971 --> 35:42.240
♪ I guess we never
really said goodbye ♪

35:42.306 --> 35:44.509
♪

35:44.575 --> 35:46.177
- ALEX: Cara...

35:46.244 --> 35:47.979
- CARA: How are you?
- ALEX: Pretty good.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.848
How are you?
- CARA: Doing well.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.153
{\an8}- Is that a tattoo?
- Yeah, it is, don't look at it.

35:56.220 --> 35:59.323
{\an8}- Says, "Live"?
- I cut it out a long time ago.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.659
You're the first one that could
ever read that, actually.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.861
- Oh, yeah, most of your
boyfriends can't read, so--

36:03.928 --> 36:06.330
- That's also true, thank you.
Yeah.

36:06.397 --> 36:09.834
- It is really [bleep] nice
to have you on the boat again.

36:09.901 --> 36:14.305
- As much as I hate to admit
that I missed it, I did.

36:15.907 --> 36:20.845
- Well, I feel like this might
be the best summer yet.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.181
I like the sense of freedom,
I feel like you do, too.

36:24.248 --> 36:27.018
- I know how you are.
- And how you are.

36:27.084 --> 36:29.086
- CARA: Exactly.
- Pretty similar.

36:29.153 --> 36:32.623
- Yeap. Unfortunately.
- ALEX: I'm just better.

36:32.690 --> 36:37.762
- Better?! Oh, Alex, honey. No.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.530
- I mean, I can be honest
with you, like,

36:39.597 --> 36:43.267
I could never envision you
with Garrett, like, full time.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.537
- But Alex, you also have to
remember, like, I do love him,

36:46.604 --> 36:50.374
and like, he's the first person
that I've never cheated on

36:50.441 --> 36:52.209
in my entire life.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.845
And like, if I've learned
anything from hanging out

36:54.912 --> 36:57.815
with you guys is to stop
cheating and to stop lying

36:57.882 --> 36:59.617
because people will find out
about it.

36:59.684 --> 37:00.785
- Well.
- CARA: Yeah.

37:00.851 --> 37:03.287
- Words of wisdom. [laughs]

37:03.354 --> 37:05.823
Meanwhile, I know for a fact
you cheated on him,

37:05.890 --> 37:07.158
but it's okay.

37:07.224 --> 37:09.927
- CARA: Wait, what?
- Maybe--I just--doesn't matter,

37:09.994 --> 37:11.228
we don't need to go down
that road--

37:11.295 --> 37:14.098
- Seriously, though, because
you're literally lying.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.132
- I'm not lying.

37:15.199 --> 37:16.867
- Who said that I've cheated
on him?

37:16.934 --> 37:20.037
- ALEX: It doesn't matter.
- Tell me now!

37:20.104 --> 37:21.872
You wanna [bleep] start
something like that with me,

37:21.939 --> 37:23.908
why don't you [bleep] tell me
what you heard?

37:23.975 --> 37:28.279
I'd love to hear it.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.949
- ALEX: I know for a fact you
cheated on him, but it's okay.

37:32.016 --> 37:34.018
{\an8}- Wait, what?
I'd love to know.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.988
{\an8}Wait, no, I'd love to know.

37:37.054 --> 37:38.656
{\an8}What you think you're
referring to.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.257
{\an8}- I just--doesn't matter,
we don't need to go

37:40.324 --> 37:41.592
{\an8}down that road--
- Seriously, though,

37:41.659 --> 37:44.895
because you're literally lying.
- ALEX: I'm not lying.

37:44.962 --> 37:48.933
- Okay, tell me
what I did, then.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.835
Tell me now!

37:50.901 --> 37:54.171
- Juliette, don't punch me.
- What about Juli--

37:54.238 --> 37:55.606
- It's a joke.
- Okay.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.808
{\an8}Who did I cheat on him with?
- I don't know the name

37:57.875 --> 38:00.711
{\an8}of the person, but there would
be no reason for someone else

38:00.778 --> 38:03.114
{\an8}to just make [bleep] up
about you, uh,

38:03.180 --> 38:04.582
{\an8}having fun on the side, but--

38:04.649 --> 38:06.517
- Who said that I've cheated
on him?

38:06.584 --> 38:08.419
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, it does matter.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.955
I'm telling you I haven't.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.024
I haven't, though,
that's the thing.

38:13.090 --> 38:16.460
Because, like, I am so proud
that this is like, my first,

38:16.527 --> 38:19.430
like, "Wow, I haven't [bleep]
up, like, give yourself

38:19.497 --> 38:23.401
[bleep] pat on the back."
- How did it work out for you?

38:23.467 --> 38:26.203
- I mean, I don't have
to walk away from it feeling bad

38:26.270 --> 38:27.872
because I didn't [bleep] up
and I tried.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.975
- That's true. That's how
I feel about Juliette.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.743
- What do you mean, that's how
you feel about Juliette?

38:32.810 --> 38:35.046
You cheated on her ass
every [bleep] two seconds.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.682
I'd like to know who you think
I cheated on that kid with,

38:37.748 --> 38:42.420
because there was literally
no person that I even touched

38:42.486 --> 38:43.688
while I was with him.

38:43.754 --> 38:45.790
- ALEX: I believe you,
I don't think you did.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.059
- Why the [bleep] are you gonna
accuse me of some [bleep]

38:48.125 --> 38:50.127
that you don't know about?

38:50.194 --> 38:52.396
- Alright, I apologize,
I'm sorry, Cara--

38:52.463 --> 38:54.098
- That's not enough.
- I was in the wrong.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.734
- Sorry, that's not enough.
- Well, I don't know how else--

38:56.801 --> 38:59.437
I won't do it again.
- I'm not an idiot.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.338
I actually graduated
high school,

39:01.405 --> 39:03.941
unlike literally everyone here.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.377
- ALEX: Yeah, I didn't
graduate high school.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.680
- Yeah, probably not
'cause you [bleep] all Florida,

39:09.747 --> 39:11.649
I don't know, like,
the people here have

39:11.716 --> 39:14.919
no moral compass, you guys,
I'm not really quite sure

39:14.985 --> 39:17.054
what's wrong with all of you.

39:17.121 --> 39:18.389
You want me to get Amanda
up here?

39:18.456 --> 39:20.491
You wanna get Chloe up here?
- No, I want you up here.

39:20.558 --> 39:23.127
- Maybe Chloe can [bleep]
while you sit here.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.462
I don't know.
- ALEX: I mean, no,

39:24.528 --> 39:26.797
that's not going down.
- Are you offended?

39:26.864 --> 39:28.833
Because you should be.

39:28.899 --> 39:31.502
- ALEX: Yeah, I'm offended.
- Okay, bye.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.237
- ALEX: Cara, don't be a bitch,
come on.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.606
- [bleep], Alex.
- She is a brat.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.608
- CHLOE: You're being a brat.
- CARA: I don't care, Chloe.

39:37.675 --> 39:39.744
I don't care, if you wanna
[bleep] start something

39:39.810 --> 39:41.846
like that with me, why don't you
[bleep] tell me

39:41.912 --> 39:44.248
where you heard that [bleep]
and what you heard.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.683
I'd love to hear it.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.518
It's called [bleep]
slander, Alex,

39:47.585 --> 39:49.754
did you go to school?
Did you go to [bleep] school?!

39:49.820 --> 39:52.490
- Yeah, I wrote your essay
when you went to school!

39:52.556 --> 39:55.493
- CARA: It's called slander,
you can't just make [bleep] up--

39:55.559 --> 39:58.462
- Alright, so how am I [bleep]
slanderous, I'd love to know.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.431
What are the elements
of slander?

40:00.498 --> 40:02.600
- Oh, Alex.
- There's only five--

40:02.666 --> 40:04.034
- CARA: You can't just--
- There's only five.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.670
- Alex, you can't just
conjure [bleep] up in your head

40:06.737 --> 40:09.740
and try and make like
it's [bleep] real.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.442
So why don't you tell me
where you got

40:11.509 --> 40:14.712
some information?
- Let's stop this now.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.580
No, no, hear me out.
Hey, what are you doing?

40:16.647 --> 40:18.516
{\an8}- I don't [bleep] care, bye.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.017
{\an8}- CHLOE: Cara,
you're being crazy.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.720
{\an8}- CARA: No, I'm not, dude!
Because for once in my [bleep]

40:22.787 --> 40:25.022
{\an8}life I didn't [bleep]
cheat on someone!

guys wanted to know

40:29.627 --> 40:31.796

I am now!
