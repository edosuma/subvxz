WEBVTT

01:09.470 --> 01:11.270
Welcome to Iceland.

01:11.272 --> 01:14.773
Thirty minutes,
we'll be reaching...

02:14.300 --> 02:16.401
You know that you used all
your savings for this trip?

02:16.403 --> 02:17.769
Yeah.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.672
I really wanna
help out so...

02:20.674 --> 02:21.707
Just...

02:22.877 --> 02:24.576
Yeah, I just thought...

02:24.911 --> 02:26.745
-Nope, nope, no!
-Yeah!

02:26.747 --> 02:28.447
-Oh, you didn't.
-I did.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.681
It's in my mouth. It's in--

02:29.683 --> 02:31.750
yup, yup, yup, yup!

02:36.256 --> 02:38.924
So you think we're gonna
be able to find film?

02:38.926 --> 02:42.794
I brought a lot of film
before I came out here.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.530
So we're okay.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.366
Why won't you just let me
buy you that new camera?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.568
I don't want a computer
autocorrecting everything.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.336
I wanna capture
the moment.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.273
You are a stubborn
son of a gun.

02:54.275 --> 02:58.343
My dad would talk about
capturing the moment, okay?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.546
Now I was never
very good at it.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.416
Um, I mean sometimes i
kept a little piece of it.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.487
It feels good because
you're capturing something

03:08.489 --> 03:12.891
where everything is great.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.962
I mean, if there's an
imperfection, that's okay.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.398
That's not bad.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.906
this church was built
in the 18th century.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.612
But man came here
long before it.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.648
Fleeing the tyranny of
Harold the fairhair.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.320
Harold the fairhair
of normandy.

03:41.322 --> 03:46.425
Yeah, but later spread the
word of god to the healers.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.893
What was life
like back then?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.995
Well it was simple.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.431
And the stories
were simple.

03:53.666 --> 03:57.636
There's that mischievous
age of the warmhearted.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.540
And the adventures of
inqua, the far traveler.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.308
You heard about inqua?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.743
-I have not.
-No.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.744
Okay, okay.

04:12.285 --> 04:15.520
And this is where early
parliament meetings were held.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.940
This is
or long rock.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.947
I think I just defiled the.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.584
You defiled the.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.787
No.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.824
Nothing I missed
about churches.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.762
What was your
dad's place like?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.697
It was plain.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.534
White walls,
beige carpets.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.004
Felt more like an
office building than...

05:08.574 --> 05:10.309
But this.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.819
Baby, wake up.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.654
-Mmm.
-Wake up!

07:35.656 --> 07:37.556
Let's go experience
Iceland.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.124
It's getting late.
I'm hungry.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.126
We can get some food.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.028
I'm still on us time.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.064
Well, there's only
one way out of that.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.699
Get up.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.669
No.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.177
It's so bright in here.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.585
There's supposed to be
continental breakfast.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.987
Wanna do cafÃ©?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.055
Yup.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.533
Someone's asleep
at the wheel.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.767
what time is it?

08:55.769 --> 08:57.636
10:30, I think.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.704
Why?

08:59.706 --> 09:00.972
Well it's just...

09:00.974 --> 09:02.607
It's empty.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.076
Is it like a holiday or...

09:08.247 --> 09:11.716
I don't know. Maybe some
event or something.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.586
Like the solstice.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.587
That's a
celebration, right?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.589
The summer solstice.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.127
Okay.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.274
Hello!

09:39.111 --> 09:40.579
Hello?

09:48.154 --> 09:51.256
I mean, wouldn't we have
heard some sort of an event.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.959
Like seen a billboard
or something.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.827
Hello!

10:03.369 --> 10:05.971
We need to look inside.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.072
Okay, where?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.140
Anywhere. I-i-i...

10:12.211 --> 10:13.778
Hello?

10:15.915 --> 10:17.148
Hello?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.186
Hello?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.787
There's nobody.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.236
I called the restaurant
from last night

10:38.238 --> 10:39.971
and there's no answer.

10:40.773 --> 10:41.940
Riley.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.675
Yeah?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.377
I called my mom.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.646
And?

10:47.648 --> 10:49.347
She didn't answer.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.816
what the hell is happening?

11:27.453 --> 11:29.320
We walked through
half the city.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.356
Where did everybody go?

11:32.958 --> 11:35.694
It's like everybody
went on a lunch break.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.997
City wide.

11:42.468 --> 11:46.071
Is there a, uh...

11:46.073 --> 11:52.043
There's gotta be coverage on
whatever the hell this is.

11:56.248 --> 11:59.017
I mean, the TV's
still working.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.230
Hey, mom, um...

12:12.232 --> 12:14.999
It's been a super weird
day here and I just would

12:15.001 --> 12:16.234
love to be able
to talk to you.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.303
So if you can
give me a call.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.377
The only channels that aren't
working are the news shows.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.889
Riley, this is starting
to freak me out.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.391
I know, I don't
get it at all.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.128
If it were a plague,
where are all the bodies?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.263
I mean, if it were aliens,
where are the ships?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.498
I don't...

12:46.500 --> 12:49.000
There's no
emails, no posts.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.101
No activity anywhere.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.770
Wait, what do you mean?

13:03.216 --> 13:06.885
Hey, aims, um...
Call me when you get this.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.154
I would love to
hear your voice.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.097
No one's picking up.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.532
Everyone should be up by now.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.401
Nobody? No text messages,
no emails, nothing?

13:25.571 --> 13:26.971
Nothing.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.076
The Internet is
still working.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.547
No, this is
from yesterday.

13:35.549 --> 13:38.049
That hasn't been updated
since yesterday.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.193
What is happening?

13:49.094 --> 13:51.062
Nobody's picking
up their phones.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.364
Voicemail's still working.
City's empty.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.068
I mean, if it was an
Internet problem, we

13:57.070 --> 13:59.537
wouldn't even be seeing
this stuff, right?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.241
We need a vantage point.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.443
We need a world view.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.186
What is going on?

14:16.021 --> 14:17.222
No.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.357
No.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.525
No.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.161
No.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.264
We're here, baby.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.333
There's gotta
be other people.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.970
There's gotta be
somebody, somewhere.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.338
Let's go.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.080
What the fuck?

14:42.082 --> 14:43.948
Hey, hello?

14:55.294 --> 14:57.896
It's still in drive.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.485
Is something happening?

15:23.122 --> 15:24.589
What do you mean?

15:26.358 --> 15:28.559
Is this it?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.495
Is this the rapture?

15:33.232 --> 15:36.501
You mean like
the apocalypse?

15:36.503 --> 15:39.270
The end of times.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.341
Try your mother again.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.360
hello!

16:26.652 --> 16:28.753
Hi, you've reached
Sharon's cellphone.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.589
I'm not available to take your
call right now, but if you'd--

16:34.727 --> 16:36.627
voicemail.

16:50.275 --> 16:54.645
I wanna say that everybody
just went to the east side

16:54.647 --> 16:56.447
of the island.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.020
And I wanna say that your
mom just went shopping and

17:02.022 --> 17:04.489
she forgot her
phone at home.

17:04.491 --> 17:08.226
Same as your dad and
Amy and everybody else.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.294
I wanna say this is
the second coming.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.163
I wanna say this is the
longest nightmare that I

17:12.165 --> 17:13.631
have ever had.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.665
But I just...

17:17.136 --> 17:19.103
I don't know
what happened.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.142
Atleast...

17:28.146 --> 17:30.148
Atleast we're
here together.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.372
Can you please
close the blinds?

17:56.575 --> 17:59.310
Where did you all go?

18:00.145 --> 18:02.213
I wanna go to sleep.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.217
I'm exhausted and the sun
won't quit so can you

18:06.219 --> 18:08.453
please close the blinds?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.521
Yeah, baby.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.206
Come on, baby.
It's time to wake up.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.775
Not yet.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.378
You gotta eat
something, I mean.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.547
Let's go make
some breakfast.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.884
No.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.187
How are we gonna get home?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.491
How are we getting
off this island?

19:22.528 --> 19:24.262
I don't know yet.

19:26.899 --> 19:32.270
I mean, do you think
we were selected?

19:32.272 --> 19:35.439
That we should be
preparing for something?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.808
No, baby, we're not
selected, okay?

19:37.810 --> 19:40.511
This is not divine
intervention.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.246
I don't know.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.881
I don't know if
this is an epidemic.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.652
I don't know if it's some sort
of nordic relocation program.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.555
I don't know why we're here
and everybody else isn't.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.957
But I do know that
doesn't matter.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.860
What matters, what we
should be asking ourselves

19:55.862 --> 19:58.429
is what do we do about it?

19:59.264 --> 20:01.566
Like what do we do now?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.638
I just wanna get home.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.574
I know.

20:10.809 --> 20:15.213
If there's even a...

20:15.215 --> 20:16.881
A home to get back to.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.682
baby, guess what?

20:51.684 --> 20:55.419
There's still room service
and it's just for you.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.760
Gingerbread latte.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.470
Is it that bad?

21:12.472 --> 21:13.771
There's still too
much ginger bread.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.006
Hm.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.541
I overdid it.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.744
-Thank you.
-Mhm.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.338
Gotta do better than that.

21:59.384 --> 22:00.551
Ah!

22:02.321 --> 22:03.654
I'll be right back.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.981
This isn't all gonna
fit in the fridge.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.084
I know, I've been
thinking about that.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.585
Sit tight.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.802
It's time to
upgrade, baby.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.537
Upgrade what?

22:54.773 --> 22:56.674
Everything.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.753
hello?

23:09.555 --> 23:14.725
Yeah, well we don't need to
because this is our place now.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.762
That's nice.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.009
Just like that?

23:32.011 --> 23:33.878
Just like that.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.720
Why are the
lights still on?

23:42.722 --> 23:47.057
The geothermal plants,
they're all automated here

23:47.059 --> 23:50.127
so they'll just keep the country
running for a little while.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.662
Until it breaks down.

23:51.664 --> 23:57.134
But yeah, until then, the
world just keeps on turning.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.109
You done yet?

24:08.513 --> 24:09.647
Which color?

24:12.617 --> 24:13.617
Yes.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.457
Why do I need these red gloves?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.830
What do you think?

24:28.533 --> 24:29.767
Whoa!

24:29.769 --> 24:30.868
You're like a
Mexican ninja.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.203
What are you doing?

24:34.005 --> 24:36.207
Oh, no.

24:42.548 --> 24:43.848
here, here.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.883
To many!

24:49.755 --> 24:50.754
Don't puke!

24:50.756 --> 24:51.989
You're gonna puke!

24:55.962 --> 24:58.162
What is it saying?

25:01.501 --> 25:03.734
What is this word language?

25:03.736 --> 25:05.669
Borg...
I just burped.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.072
Borg...

25:08.074 --> 25:09.106
Corona's a thousand.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.274
Give me a
thousand coronas.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.843
I won a beauty
content makes sense.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.512
You wanted to
be the banker.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.146
That's 20,000.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.882
-Thank you.
-Okay.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.083
Woo.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.623
What is that?

25:25.625 --> 25:26.724
Bullshit.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.925
This is mine.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.026
You're taking the whole...

25:29.028 --> 25:30.794
This is a death strip.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.997
And I'm supposed to be
able to get through?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.231
You're gonna
take all of this.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.833
Here, it's yours.
I'm not...

25:35.835 --> 25:38.068
Man the great.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.770
Stripopoly.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.272
It doesn't make sense!

25:48.947 --> 25:52.917
This took only 35 minutes.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.853
That is a new world
record for me.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.557
Ugh.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.091
Thank you.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.128
First, lattes.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.330
Then the world.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.736
Do you think
this is a test?

26:12.738 --> 26:14.905
Test of what?

26:14.907 --> 26:17.641
Like the trials of job.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.777
Like a test of faith?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.782
Um...

26:24.784 --> 26:27.751
I mean, you believe
in god, right?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.053
Yes.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.221
And do you think that all
of this, everything that

26:31.223 --> 26:37.194
has happened, was all
a part of god's plan?

26:37.196 --> 26:40.864
Well, belief and faith
aren't the same thing.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.800
I don't know what
god's plan is.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.268
Well, that's kind
of the point.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.742
What are we gonna do?

26:54.346 --> 26:56.080
Mm...

26:59.184 --> 27:03.354
Maybe everybody really did go to
the other side of the island.

27:03.356 --> 27:08.826
Okay? Maybe the main
communication pipe failed.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.930
Or maybe this
will all pass.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.299
And in the meantime...

27:15.301 --> 27:20.704
Baby, this world is
ours for the making.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.475
Mmm.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.045
Naptime.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.228
You're ruining my naptime.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.263
Oh, am I?

29:30.135 --> 29:32.369
You go on and
take your nap.

32:59.177 --> 33:00.344
hey.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.211
Jenai, you gotta try this!

33:36.748 --> 33:38.548
Jenai, where are you?

33:50.294 --> 33:51.261
fuck.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.545
no.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.679
Okay.

34:29.132 --> 34:34.538
Just because this place fell
off the geothermal grid...

34:34.540 --> 34:37.407
Doesn't mean we can't
utilize the romantic

34:37.409 --> 34:39.342
comedy of this, you know?

34:39.344 --> 34:40.177
This is nice.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.645
Yeah, it is.

34:47.552 --> 34:49.686
The wine.

34:50.554 --> 34:52.355
Some cheese.

34:53.357 --> 34:54.524
Okay.

34:58.229 --> 35:00.797
We need to talk
about this.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.699
Riley!

35:05.337 --> 35:07.237
Why are you laughing?

35:08.606 --> 35:12.242
You need to be more
careful, please.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.211
This was an accident.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.546
How am I supposed to stop
an accident from happening?

35:16.548 --> 35:18.482
You could've
broken a bone.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.551
Or worse, hit an artery.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.856
And you don't think we could've
avoided that accident.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.624
We're not gonna stop
living our lives just

35:27.626 --> 35:28.592
because you think
something might happen.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.160
Excuse me.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.495
We're not gonna stop
living our lives--

35:31.497 --> 35:34.531
okay, it is not about that.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.500
What if something
were to happen to you?

35:36.502 --> 35:37.634
There is no 9-1-1.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.237
There is no one.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.172
You're freaking
out right now.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.641
Can you just relax
and enjoy this...

35:53.451 --> 35:54.718
I'm fine.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.686
It's just a scratch.

35:56.688 --> 36:00.190
We can't just childproof
this whole city.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.660
We can't be
jackasses either.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.234
Out here?

36:11.236 --> 36:13.370
Out here we're on our own.

36:37.428 --> 36:39.529
I should be in the shower.

36:45.269 --> 36:47.504
It's six o'clock
back home.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.806
On wednesdays I'm just
getting back from the gym

36:49.808 --> 36:51.942
and I take a shower.

36:55.279 --> 36:57.214
No.

36:57.216 --> 37:00.550
I'm not gonna goof
off anymore, okay?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.385
I'm gonna be more
careful I promise.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.454
From now on.

37:05.323 --> 37:06.923
I should have brought it.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.362
We were only supposed
to be gone five days.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.664
What'd you forget?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.233
My book.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.268
To kill a mockingbird.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.906
I just didn't think
that I would need it.

37:22.908 --> 37:26.009
Well I'm sure that there's an
English copy of it somewhere.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.277
No, I don't want a copy.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.512
I want my copy.

37:32.250 --> 37:39.656
It wasn't a journal, it
was I guess more of a log.

37:41.993 --> 37:46.563
Everything important that
happened or you know,

37:46.565 --> 37:51.268
little memories, I'd write
everything in there.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.581
Why kill a mockingbird?

38:04.583 --> 38:06.716
My dad got it for me.

38:06.718 --> 38:12.956
This story about
racism, lynching, rape.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.959
Great bedtime story
for an eight-year-old.

38:16.661 --> 38:22.732
For whatever reason i-i hung
onto it, I connected with it.

38:26.737 --> 38:28.571
You're in there.

38:29.607 --> 38:32.375
I'm in your book?

38:32.377 --> 38:35.412
The first time i
said I love you.

38:36.547 --> 38:43.420
Well before I said it to
you, I wrote it in there.

38:53.831 --> 38:59.369
when I look around,
i see a beautiful country,

38:59.371 --> 39:06.609
I see land, Springs, houses,
and then there's you and me.

39:06.611 --> 39:09.045
And we have
everything we need.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.581
Everything else,
we can build.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.917
Just you and I together.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.986
We can't build everything.

39:18.623 --> 39:19.689
We don't need to.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.458
The hard work's
been done for us.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.361
Just need to stock up
a little, that's all.

39:27.898 --> 39:30.133
We have the world
at our feet.

39:34.505 --> 39:36.840
I just wanna go home.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.779
I just want my book back.

40:40.704 --> 40:41.938
damnit.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.579
What are you eating?

40:50.881 --> 40:53.082
That's the blueberry one.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.918
The blueberry ones
aren't ready yet.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.686
Well.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.788
Tastes ready.

41:01.992 --> 41:05.728
The strawberry
ones expire first.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.630
Well I wanted a
blueberry one.

41:10.734 --> 41:12.836
We agreed to eat
them in order.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.538
It's like three days
different, alright.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.606
That's not the point.

41:16.608 --> 41:21.211
The point is, we are not going
to have fruits and vegetables.

41:21.213 --> 41:23.513
And then the meat goes
if the refrigeration

41:23.515 --> 41:25.648
is still even working.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.785
Look.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.954
We can plant
more vegetables.

41:30.956 --> 41:32.055
I can get more meat.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.189
No, that's-that's good.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.224
So what are you gonna do?

41:34.226 --> 41:35.758
Go be Johnny hunter?

41:35.760 --> 41:38.094
Get a shotgun and shoot
a cow in the head?

41:38.096 --> 41:39.896
And then what?

41:39.898 --> 41:42.832
Do you really think
you're capable of that?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.667
Do you think I am?

41:50.708 --> 41:52.642
Just eat the food in order.

42:52.571 --> 42:55.772
nice uh, mark.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.708
Taking ash Wednesday to
the next level, huh?

43:04.214 --> 43:06.616
Can I ask you something?

43:07.685 --> 43:09.886
This whole thing, this
disappearing act.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.754
Was this your guy?

43:12.122 --> 43:14.657
Because I can't
figure it out.

43:15.626 --> 43:17.794
Maybe it was my guy.

43:18.596 --> 43:22.665
Maybe those chosen few
are back home roasting

43:22.667 --> 43:24.834
marshmallows or whatever.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.082
Why does this happen
when I'm here?

43:39.950 --> 43:42.218
Stuck in no man's land.

43:44.355 --> 43:47.190
Maybe our guys
are the same guys.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.192
You ever think about that?

43:51.362 --> 43:54.931
Maybe that's why I'm
stuck in no man's land.

44:33.270 --> 44:35.271
do you wonder where we are?

44:40.711 --> 44:42.345
Yeah.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.456
do you hear that?

44:55.726 --> 44:57.727
What?

44:59.129 --> 45:01.798
It's the heartbeat
of the world.

45:10.174 --> 45:11.741
I love it here.

45:15.479 --> 45:17.080
Can you see it?

45:53.817 --> 45:57.920
they say that there were these
two trolls who tried to stop

45:57.922 --> 46:00.757
the incoming ships
in the new world.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.994
They grabbed
and they pulled.

46:09.433 --> 46:13.903
But the ships were too
strong, and the sun rose

46:13.905 --> 46:16.205
and turned the
trolls to stone.

46:17.308 --> 46:23.780
kind of gateway between the
ancient ways and the new world.

46:24.047 --> 46:25.515
It's like they were
waiting for us to bring in

46:25.517 --> 46:28.384
everything that was clean
and good and fresh.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.153
I always liked that.

46:36.193 --> 46:38.161
We're out of water.

46:40.998 --> 46:42.865
I know.

47:20.137 --> 47:22.839
It's from the 70s.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.941
What's it doing here?

47:24.943 --> 47:27.977
Um, just
abandoned I guess.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.979
You see it the side.

47:31.114 --> 47:33.482
What, they just left it?

47:33.484 --> 47:35.251
I guess so.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.520
It's beautiful though,
don't you think?

47:42.626 --> 47:45.294
I don't think we're
looking at the same thing.

47:47.931 --> 47:49.365
What do you mean?

47:49.367 --> 47:53.236
Another forsaken object that's
outlived its usefulness.

47:53.238 --> 47:55.171
It's just an airplane.

47:55.173 --> 47:57.406
Exactly, it's garbage.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.442
Don't try to tell me
that it's beautiful.

47:59.444 --> 48:01.010
This is dead.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.178
Can't you see
what this is?

48:02.180 --> 48:03.512
No, go ahead. Enlighten me.
What is it?

48:03.514 --> 48:05.581
No one's coming
back for us.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.049
No one.

48:09.186 --> 48:11.053
I thought you'd like this.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.421
This isn't some
sort of game.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.156
God damnit, I know
it's not a game.

48:14.158 --> 48:17.560
Well you can't just change the
scenery and expect me to smile!

48:18.528 --> 48:20.396
What am I supposed to do?

48:29.273 --> 48:31.407
Open your eyes, Riley.

53:18.261 --> 53:21.497
shit! No, no, no!

54:05.575 --> 54:07.243
jenai?

55:49.679 --> 55:51.413
hey.

55:51.415 --> 55:54.383
Just wanted to talk
for a little a bit.

55:54.385 --> 55:59.588
I was being a jerk and i
ran off the some show so I

55:59.590 --> 56:01.924
get to sit here
and be angry.

56:02.893 --> 56:06.829
I know it's however
many hours later there.

56:06.831 --> 56:07.896
Okay.

56:07.898 --> 56:09.531
I miss you.

56:17.974 --> 56:19.708
What are we...

56:19.710 --> 56:21.710
What are we doing?

56:21.712 --> 56:23.612
Nothing, go back to sleep.

56:27.550 --> 56:28.617
Hi.

56:28.619 --> 56:29.752
Just so were clear.

56:29.754 --> 56:31.754
Your boyfriend took
me to Europe.

56:31.756 --> 56:33.722
My boyfriend is hungover.

56:33.724 --> 56:36.625
So keep having
fun out there.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.627
For the both of us.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.129
Love you.

56:46.569 --> 56:48.804
Hey, I must have
just missed you.

56:48.806 --> 56:51.673
Well I wanted to tell you
that I just bought the

56:51.675 --> 56:55.411
tickets so
Iceland is a go.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.846
And uh, I'll see
you at dinner.

56:57.848 --> 56:59.515
I love you.

57:20.571 --> 57:24.440
You still don't have a
place to develop them.

57:25.108 --> 57:26.542
I will.

57:59.243 --> 58:00.676
What?

58:02.979 --> 58:05.147
We're sitting
on a glacier.

58:11.821 --> 58:13.222
This is the equalizer.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.493
Force of nature that
wipes the earth clean.

58:21.798 --> 58:23.632
What's so funny about that?

58:27.036 --> 58:29.771
Maybe god got impatient.

58:36.679 --> 58:39.615
I can't tell you what's
happening tonight.

58:40.049 --> 58:44.253
I've been trying to figure
it out and I don't...

58:44.255 --> 58:46.054
I'm not giving up on you.

58:46.056 --> 58:47.890
I'm not giving up on us.

58:50.260 --> 58:51.960
I know.

58:58.968 --> 59:00.202
Do you hear that?

59:47.817 --> 59:49.818
What?

59:49.820 --> 59:51.353
I don't know.

59:51.355 --> 59:54.122
Might be kinda fun to
change up the place a bit.

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.130
Wait, uh...
Babe, wait a second.

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:03.799
Oh god.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.974
My god, there's
nothing left.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:14.943
Exactly. There's no
need to be here.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.678
Let's go, please.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.113
Just turn around.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.091
We'll find some flowers.

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.902
This is what we needed.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.971
Just a change of scenery.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.009
I mean, the city's no
place for us right now.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.880
We're pioneers here. We don't
need all those complications.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:56.118
Man has been happy for thousands
of years without all that stuff.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.154
Just come out here
where the air is fresh

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.123
and everything's simple.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.226
Simple.

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:09.831
Of course that means no
more gingerbread lattes.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.167
I'll survive.

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.009
We got enough food
for the weekend.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.945
It's gonna be a nice
little uh, little getaway.

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.999
Let's find a spot.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.916
Beautiful.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:00.308
There's a fireplace.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.910
Yeah.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.545
Wood stove.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.181
I'll go get some wood.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.089
I mean, you can't beat that.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.334
Sir?

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:27.836
Sir.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.171
Sir, are you okay?

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:30.572
Are you okay?

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.181
Do you speak English?

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.817
May I have some water?

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.885
Yes, of course. Can you
get him water, please?

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.256
My name is Riley.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:52.527
My name is Nance.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.397
Do you have any food?

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:56.331
Of course.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.933
We have plenty of food.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.202
How long have
you been here?

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.005
Oh, thank you.

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:15.884
How long have you been here?

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:18.253
Oh, geez.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.055
You're alright,
you're alright.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.323
Come on.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.860
Alright.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.361
Let's get some food.

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.532
Here, come sit here.

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:56.892
We thought we were alone.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.894
So...

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:02.364
There is no one else.

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.165
You found no one.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.669
Just you.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.372
Are you alone here?

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:15.543
When everyone disappeared,
i left the city.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:22.417
I thought if the world is
going to end, I will come

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:29.190
here where shortly
I'll join them.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:32.294
Were you in Iceland
when it happened?

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.370
Is this your place?

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.473
This is my cabin.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:49.978
But in previous life
i was a fisherman.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.113
What have you been doing?

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:58.987
I made my bed.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.591
Well you don't have to
join your family just yet.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:04.459
I mean, we're here.

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:08.229
We can stick together.
We can survive.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:16.071
Can we get him water?

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.974
Here, here, here.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.308
Drink this.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.089
I'm just so glad
that I found you.

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:44.099
I thought, I thought
god abandoned us.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.602
They say that god only...

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.410
He just must have more
to say these days.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.149
Well it's still good to
know that we're not alone.

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.088
We hadn't been alone.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.757
It's worse.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:11.059
You and I.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:15.597
Well Jesus Christ, I mean,
that's not very helpful.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.265
Alright?

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.300
There's three of us now.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:23.638
There is one and one and one.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.743
We each occupy our
own distinct space.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:32.213
It's worse alone on the sea.

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.383
I don't get why...

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.252
It doesn't make any sense.

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:39.721
Why are you so
determined to give up?

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.499
What brought you here?

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.671
Uh, we were on vacation.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.409
My first time overseas.

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:06.247
I've been here
all my life.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:18.593
I spent time in the
isles, years ago,

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:22.497
but the sun has always set
on the western shore for me.

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.870
I miss my family.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:37.212
The welsh have a word.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:39.613
Hera.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:44.819
Grief for a home
you cannot return.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:57.665
And as a young man, I left
my wife and my young son

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.667
to make my living.

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:03.404
I was on the seas for months.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:09.410
When I returned,
nothing was the same.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:14.883
My son was a young lad and
my wife was not the woman

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:17.352
I had left.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.558
I sat in my own home
and did not belong.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.826
She left you?

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.895
She didn't need to.

01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:29.663
She was already absent.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:34.368
But soon I spent more and
more time on the sea.

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:37.705
There was nothing
you could do?

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.908
How is that fair?

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.645
The world is the world.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:47.782
You cannot fault it for
not behaving as you

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.484
believe it should.

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:51.786
So you don't believe that
we've been led here to

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.388
find each other?

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:57.492
We do not factor
in the will of god.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:10:00.461
His plan for us to exist
in the world he has

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:05.466
created for us not to
exist in his world.

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.770
What if that's true then?

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:11.873
We really are on our own.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:18.379
There's another
meaning of hera.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.550
Longing for a
foregone home.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:26.454
Perhaps a home
that never was.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.724
And none of it matters.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:33.695
Even if god exists,
he's forsaken us.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.698
You, human, go forth.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:43.805
And in the end the question of
our context is inconsequential.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:49.777
If there is a design we
are foregone to fit within it.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:56.017
And if there is no design,
we are alone in our keep

01:10:56.019 --> 01:11:00.855
and no ground
will hold us.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.845
It's time to wake up.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:37.592
Do you want me to make
you guys some tea?

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:45.033
He um...

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:46.868
He didn't make it.

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.587
There's a cemetery
down by the lake.

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.825
I already picked
a spot for him.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.535
What are we doing?

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:27.008
We're burying him
with his family.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.910
Is this his family?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.549
Have they missed him?

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.685
Will they welcome him now?

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.655
Yeah, you're not
making any sense.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.757
Talk to me.

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:44.959
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.663
What's the point
of burying him?

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:51.899
Laying here,
six feet under.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.434
What's the difference?

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:56.671
This is what we do.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.673
We bury the dead.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.443
None of this
makes any sense.

01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:04.011
What doesn't
make any sense?

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:05.747
Why was he here?

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.017
I don't know.

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:13.087
There has to be
someone else.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.626
Old man, or a woman, or a
child that may need our help.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:20.728
It's been weeks.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:22.864
We haven't seen anybody.

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:24.799
But have we really
been looking?

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.736
Please help me.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.438
It can't just be us.

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:00.935
Hello?

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.939
Hello?

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:14.982
You've been busy.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:16.617
Here.

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.455
Um...

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.591
What uh...

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:27.528
If there's someone out there,
we need to find them.

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:31.666
You're not looking for the
living, you're marking the dead.

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:33.067
Will you just come home?

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.670
Baby, we can work
on this together.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:38.573
There's no home here.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.210
You, me, nails.
That's it.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.247
You don't know, we could
be a statistical anomaly.

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:49.250
Baby, we could be the world's
last rounding error.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:50.852
Alright? You're looking for
answers where there aren't any--

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:53.788
you're damn right I'm
looking for answers!

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:58.059
You have this insane
situation and what,

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:01.496
you think it's some
celestial mistake?

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:03.865
I'm not saying that
it's a mistake.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:07.535
I'm just saying it
doesn't really matter.

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:10.071
Is this gonna change the
way that you live your life?

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.205
Does it have to?

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:13.274
Is it gonna change
who you are?

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.711
None of this
makes any sense.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:21.949
No, it doesn't
make any sense.

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.854
But it doesn't matter.

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:30.625
We can still
live a good life.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.135
I don't even know what
that is anymore.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.926
Keep your
eyes on me, okay?

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:48.369
Oop, oop, oop!

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:49.737
Alright, don't look.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.305
Why?

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.945
It's beautiful.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.023
Do you remember that
glacier you took me to?

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:11.892
Do you remember the water?

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:16.130
This is that water.

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.666
When the ice melts, it
cuts through the base and

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:20.401
it creates this river.

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:28.009
The glacier slides a little
further, it refreezes, it...

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.810
It's just this
constant cycle.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.648
Life is resetting,
it's reinventing.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.851
Jenai, it's trying.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.319
Okay?

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:42.189
I mean, this place is
beautiful because of all that.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.126
There is no tomorrow here.

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:46.293
There is no yesterday.

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:47.728
There is just this
moment right here--

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:49.063
stop.

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.431
I am trying.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:17.291
This is the last
of the water

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:20.227
so we'll have to get
some more tomorrow.

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.368
I wanna thank
you for today.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.005
Yeah.
