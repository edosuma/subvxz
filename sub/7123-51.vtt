Hey, that's better.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.057
Who are you?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.759
My name's Phlannel Boxingday.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.515
And I've been watching you

00:52.594 --> 00:54.267
and your hard, hot
life in this desert

00:54.346 --> 00:56.895
from up there in
my cloud trawler.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.068
I thought you might need a hand.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.143
Mm-hmm.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.071
Kid, truth be told, you're
looking a little raw.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.897
You're totally free to
come hang out with me

01:04.982 --> 01:06.655
until you're feeling stronger.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.987
- Hmm.
- It's your choice.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.833
Let's go, dude.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.376
So... read any
good books lately?

01:20.455 --> 01:22.128
Oh, I can't read.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.177
They tried to teach me in
school, but I just faked it.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.845
Uh-huh.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.593
Uh-oh. Hold that thought, buddy.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.845
Looks like a Greed Lard's
picked up our scent.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.597
Dang it! He's a fast one.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.520
We can't outrun him. But
maybe we can drive him off.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.849
I need you to play that
flute of yours, Lemonhope.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.400
I saw how you wrassled
those scorpions before.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.694
Now play that flute
with all your might.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.616
Keep it up, Lemonhope.
It's working.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.569
He's turning off.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.747
No, wait. He... he's mad.
We've enraged him.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.574
He's calling his pack.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.625
The harp, Lemonhope.
Quick, quick, quick.

02:01.163 --> 02:04.087
We'll lure the beast
into the rocks.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.731
No! Phlannel, stop the ship!

02:19.806 --> 02:22.104
Stop the ship! - What? What for?

02:22.184 --> 02:26.690
Stop the shi-i-i-i-p!

02:26.772 --> 02:28.900
You see, Lemonhope,
it's not peeps.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.655
It's Dosh. - Oh.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.486
Greed Lards eat dosh for food.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.038
And 'cause we killed it,
we get to keep it all.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.490
That's my job, Lemonhope.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.621
When I'm not out being free
and having adventures,

02:38.700 --> 02:40.702
I'm killing monsters
that eat dosh

02:40.786 --> 02:42.163
and then keeping the dosh.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.624
And it just so happens that I'm
looking for a new apprentice.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.459
What do you think
about partnering up

02:47.542 --> 02:49.510
with old Phlannel Boxingday?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.179
Oh, my gosh, Phlannel! Yes!

02:51.254 --> 02:53.803
It's a dream come true!

02:53.882 --> 02:56.010
A dream come true!

02:56.093 --> 02:57.936

Something don't feel right.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.832
Oh, hey! Lemonhope is here!

03:26.915 --> 03:29.384
Hey, man, how's it go...
Whoa, what the heck?!

03:29.459 --> 03:31.507
Run for it, Lemonhope!

03:31.586 --> 03:33.259
Run! Run! Come on!

Lemonh-o-o-o-pe!

03:44.599 --> 03:46.226
Morning, Lemonhope.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.812
Hey, is there any more white
coal down in the hold?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.694
More black diamonds
equals more love potions.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.242
The old three R's, you
know what I'm saying?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.069
"R-R-Romance."

03:56.153 --> 03:59.123
Oh, man, I can't wait
for some lo-o-ve.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.199
It's been so lo... oops!

04:01.283 --> 04:03.911
Oh. Rats. Oh, well.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.713
Hey, don't sweat it, buddy.
It wasn't your fault.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.837
It's not that, Phlannel.
I had a bad dream.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.339
Again? That's the
third time this week.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.343
I'm free now, Phlannel,

04:15.422 --> 04:17.390
to do all whatevs I ever wanted,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.889
but all I think about
is my old life.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.891
What does it mean?

04:21.970 --> 04:25.144
Well, it's true you are free...

04:25.223 --> 04:28.272
Free to help the Lemon
people or leave them be.

04:28.351 --> 04:32.401
But a debt unpaid is
not easily forgotten,

04:32.481 --> 04:34.734
so you are a prisoner still...

04:34.816 --> 04:36.614
<i>in deinem kopf.</i>

04:36.693 --> 04:39.037
Huh. That's what
mistress always said,

04:39.112 --> 04:40.580
and I didn't even listen.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.625
Ah, Lemonhope, you're a
doer, not a listener.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.500
You learn with your hands
and heart, not your head.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.877
So, what will you do, Lemonhope?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.505
I'll... I'll... I'll
go back, and...

04:52.584 --> 04:54.507
<i>I'll</i> help my people-

04:54.586 --> 04:56.133
And maybe I'll feel better.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.636
And how will you do it?

04:58.715 --> 05:03.642
Urn, with my harp and...
my flute!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.768
And help from my
friend Phlannel!

05:05.847 --> 05:07.770
Ah, little Lemonhope.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.272
Of course I'll take
you as far as I can,

05:10.352 --> 05:13.947
but I can't interfere directly
in Lemongrab politics.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.026
All those old pacts and treaties
have me sklonked up tighter

05:17.108 --> 05:18.985
than a synthetic
zanoit sterilizer

05:19.069 --> 05:22.243

Hmm...

06:02.946 --> 06:04.994
Looking for something?

06:05.073 --> 06:08.247
Well, you found me...
Fat Lemongrab!

06:09.953 --> 06:13.708
Oh, what's that you've got?
Oh, your little harp?!

06:13.790 --> 06:15.588
But what's this?

06:15.667 --> 06:19.217
I've got things in
my ears tonight!

06:19.296 --> 06:22.140
So now I'm invincible!

06:22.215 --> 06:26.186
- Play it, Lemonhope!
- What? Uh, uh, speak up, child.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.888
I didn't say anything.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.020
The harp! Hurry! I'll
take care of the rest!

06:31.099 --> 06:32.351
What?!

06:32.434 --> 06:34.562
The harp, Lemonhope! Play it!

06:34.644 --> 06:36.692
Oh, the harp!

06:36.771 --> 06:38.648
Didn't I just explain?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.734
I've got things in my...

06:41.985 --> 06:43.737
My... my... my things!

06:47.616 --> 06:50.415
Let me go!

06:50.493 --> 06:52.166
Let me gooooo!

06:52.245 --> 06:54.373
The harp, Lemonhope! The harp!

06:54.456 --> 06:55.799
Hope! Hope!

06:55.874 --> 06:56.874
Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope!

06:58.084 --> 07:00.883
It's... it's awful!

07:00.962 --> 07:02.714
Faster, Lemonhope!

07:04.132 --> 07:05.884
Faster, Lemonhope!

07:05.967 --> 07:07.890
I can't stands no more!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.937
Faster!

07:21.733 --> 07:23.201
Hmm?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.325
Coming!

07:32.118 --> 07:34.120
00:00:33:20

07:37.874 --> 07:41.629
Wait, wait, l-l-I'm...
I'm... I'm coming!

07:46.758 --> 07:48.385
Ooh!

07:53.306 --> 07:54.774
Hello?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.322
H-Hello?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.265
You know, I was
thinking, Lemonhope,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.770
maybe you'd like to
stay here in Lemongrab

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
while Lemongrab recovers.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.903
Every kingdom needs a champion,

08:40.979 --> 08:44.153
and you're a true champion
if ever I've seen one.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.451
Plus I already set up a
little room for you.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.745
Is he gonna stay like that?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.037
Like what?

08:50.113 --> 08:52.741
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.667
Once his brain's and
body's re-knit,

08:54.743 --> 08:57.166
he should be back to
his lonely old self,

08:57.245 --> 09:00.545
which seems to be his only
stable relationship model.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.500
M-M-M-Meee!

09:02.584 --> 09:04.336
So will you stay, Lemonhope,

09:04.419 --> 09:06.797
and help your people once more?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.473
Nah, that's okay.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.221
Oh. But I thought...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.677
I mean, you guys
are cool and all,

09:11.760 --> 09:13.057
but I mostly came back here

09:13.136 --> 09:15.810
so I could stop thinking
about y'all all the time.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.983
I'll be back when I'm
tired of being free.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.186
See you in a thousand
years, I guess.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.942
Peace!

09:23.021 --> 09:25.570
Wow. I really thought
he was gonna stay.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.276
Me, too. I even wrote
a song about it.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.322
- Hey, don't laugh.
- Let me hear it.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.499
No, it's terrible.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.201
Come on.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.127
- No!
- Come on!

09:38.203 --> 09:39.889
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
