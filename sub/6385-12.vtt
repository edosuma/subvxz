WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:02.104
Previously on Californication...

00:02.224 --> 00:03.086
My name is Hank.

00:03.517 --> 00:04.523
I know.

00:05.497 --> 00:06.213
Mia.

00:07.749 --> 00:10.276
This is Mia, Bill's
daughter, and this is Hank.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.322
You... you two know each other?

00:12.442 --> 00:12.943
No.

00:13.064 --> 00:14.202
She's 16.

00:14.489 --> 00:16.012
16, wow.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.889
It's not a memoir.

00:18.009 --> 00:20.362
It's a written account of my
sexual relationship with you.

00:20.373 --> 00:22.342
Written by me as a fucking novel.

00:22.386 --> 00:24.947
Even I'm confused, and
I stole the damn thing.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.187
Oh, didn't you get the memo?

00:26.307 --> 00:28.136
I'm taking "Fucking &
Punching" all over this

00:28.195 --> 00:29.140
fair country of ours...

00:29.175 --> 00:31.177
Coming soon to a super-sized
bookstore near you.

00:31.237 --> 00:31.877
They came...

00:31.997 --> 00:33.459
The divorce papers.

00:33.512 --> 00:36.821
I have said all along I still love you.

00:36.941 --> 00:38.139
Fuck your pussy.

00:39.201 --> 00:40.977
Ow! Oh, my back!

00:41.097 --> 00:41.990
You okay?

00:42.110 --> 00:42.650
Okay.

00:42.686 --> 00:43.844
What the fuck is this?

00:43.964 --> 00:45.098
Fucking retarded.

00:45.134 --> 00:45.636
Ow.

00:45.847 --> 00:47.124
Retarded and sweet...

00:48.482 --> 00:50.134
Just like you, Runkle.

00:50.895 --> 00:53.737
I can't believe you
slept with all of them.

00:55.070 --> 00:56.820
Yes, I suppose I did.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.142
So what, you're saying we
just pack up and leave L.A.?

00:59.170 --> 01:01.078
The three of us move
back to New York together?

01:01.136 --> 01:03.446
Yeah, end of the semester, whatever.

01:11.214 --> 01:18.436
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

01:20.040 --> 01:23.920
And I'm there with you in ensenada

01:24.270 --> 01:28.930
and I'm here in Echo Park carmelita

01:35.822 --> 01:37.540
What is it about New York, Hank?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.670
What do you think
you're gonna find there?

01:42.190 --> 01:43.182
Happiness.

01:43.932 --> 01:45.022
I'll be happy...

01:45.633 --> 01:46.395
Finally.

01:46.515 --> 01:47.637
Are you sure?

01:47.686 --> 01:49.210
Yes, of course I'm sure.

01:50.188 --> 01:51.274
It's what I want.

01:52.536 --> 01:53.286
I love you.

01:53.406 --> 01:56.474
Wherever you go, there you are.

01:57.586 --> 02:00.366
Oh, well, that is true, honey, but...

02:00.486 --> 02:02.520
Why do you drink so much?

02:02.773 --> 02:04.723
Are you punishing yourself?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.365
Do you feel guilty about something?

02:10.616 --> 02:12.435
I miss fucking you.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.847
Mm, I miss it too, but I
just can't do that anymore.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.554
I don't care anymore, Hank.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.532
Our best days are behind us now.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.314
You're just chasing the dragon.

02:21.986 --> 02:23.906
We're never gonna live
happily ever after.

02:24.157 --> 02:28.200
You're gonna die poor, drunk, and alone.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.712
I was available, Hank.

02:29.832 --> 02:31.309
Why didn't you love me back?

02:31.748 --> 02:33.447
Well, because I love her.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.760
You're my role model, you know,

02:37.040 --> 02:39.947
for men, for relationships.

02:40.565 --> 02:43.407
What hope could I possibly have?

02:44.740 --> 02:50.658
I think I'm sinking down and I'm all

02:50.702 --> 02:58.601
strung out on heroin on
the outskirts of town.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074

03:10.101 --> 03:12.360
Oh! Ah!

03:12.933 --> 03:13.649
Are you okay?

03:13.668 --> 03:15.630
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:16.217 --> 03:17.592
What up, ladies?

03:19.256 --> 03:21.131
Your daughter has a question for you.

03:21.251 --> 03:21.764
All right.

03:22.382 --> 03:23.701
Ask away, shortness.

03:24.052 --> 03:26.890
What's that place, again,
with the really good bagels?

03:27.010 --> 03:29.580
Oh, how soon they forget.

03:29.795 --> 03:32.624
Murray's, the answer is Murray's.

03:32.744 --> 03:33.460
Murray's.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.597
That's right.

03:34.937 --> 03:36.823
What about that other
place, on the west side,

03:36.878 --> 03:38.370
we go for breakfast sometimes?

03:38.710 --> 03:39.838
Barney something...

03:39.855 --> 03:40.652
Yeah, Greengrass...

03:40.673 --> 03:42.353
Barney Greengrass, where
you may have very well

03:42.368 --> 03:43.945
been conceived, young lady.

03:43.999 --> 03:44.782
Really?

03:44.902 --> 03:45.492
Yeah.

03:45.612 --> 03:49.114
Actually, no, it was
the bathroom at CBGB's.

03:49.234 --> 03:50.914
Jesus Christ, boundaries, people.

03:50.944 --> 03:52.334
Yeah, well, we went to the bathroom

03:52.362 --> 03:54.300
at greengrass the next
day, if you recall.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.489
And... and who's to say which
batch of seed took root, woman?

03:58.609 --> 04:00.833
- This is true.
- And there goes my appetite.

04:00.953 --> 04:03.841
We should maybe go pay a
visit there, to that shrine

04:03.961 --> 04:05.575
to your vagin... a.

04:05.695 --> 04:08.496
One of these days I'm going to
start talking openly about sex,

04:08.616 --> 04:10.394
and you're not gonna like it.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.265
Can you pass the orange juice?

04:13.385 --> 04:14.101
Of course.

04:26.742 --> 04:27.595
Shut up!

04:27.715 --> 04:28.699
Come on!

04:30.867 --> 04:31.641
This is fun.

04:31.761 --> 04:33.363
I'm gonna miss this.
I'm gonna miss you, man.

04:33.483 --> 04:35.227
I'm gonna miss you
too, vanilla sweetness.

04:35.279 --> 04:37.350
No, I mean, I'm really gonna miss you.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.816
You are my best friend, Hank.

04:39.830 --> 04:41.761
Why don't you just come
to new York with us?

04:41.810 --> 04:42.736
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:43.091 --> 04:44.483
You can be our houseboy, homeboy.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.649
That would be fun, actually, yeah.

04:46.970 --> 04:49.190
I could make you guys breakfast.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.608
I could help Becca get
dressed and ready for school.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.960
She's not a toddler, you fucktard.

04:54.034 --> 04:57.169
Oh, I don't know. I
don't have any kids...

04:57.204 --> 04:58.771
- Yet.
- What do you mean "yet?"

04:58.829 --> 05:00.350
You've had, like, five vasectomies.

05:00.379 --> 05:02.479
Two, buddy boy, two.

05:02.509 --> 05:05.044
And, you know, I think maybe
it might be time for a reversal.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.081
I think I might like to
make a baby with Marcy.

05:08.115 --> 05:09.215
- Interesting.
- Mm.

05:09.249 --> 05:11.884
Has... has Marcy shown any inclination

05:11.919 --> 05:14.520
that she might want to
make a baby with you?

05:14.555 --> 05:17.423
I have reason to believe she
might be open to such a thing.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.825
Yes, I do.

05:18.859 --> 05:20.760
Would that be before or after
the divorce papers come through?

05:20.794 --> 05:22.261
No, no, no... you don't know, Hank.

05:22.296 --> 05:24.163
We've been getting along
like gangbusters lately.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.666
Really, I would say,
if I was a bettin' man,

05:26.700 --> 05:28.701
that these two crazy kids
are gonna work it out.

05:28.736 --> 05:32.171
Yes, we are back...
up high. Give me five.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.506
Way up, in the air.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.074
- Up...
- Too high for me.

05:35.109 --> 05:36.309
Yeah, okay.

05:36.343 --> 05:38.144
Honey, I'm home.

05:38.178 --> 05:41.981
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.

05:43.717 --> 05:46.119
Hi, Hank.

05:46.153 --> 05:51.424
Wow, it's my favorite female novelist.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.392
Doesn't she look beautiful?

05:53.427 --> 05:56.129
Yes, she does. Look at you
all footloose and fancy-free

05:56.163 --> 05:57.563
and grown up.

05:57.598 --> 05:59.165
Yeah, I'm glad I caught you guys

05:59.199 --> 06:00.900
before you took off for New York.

06:00.934 --> 06:03.402
So, uh, what... what brings you to...

06:03.437 --> 06:05.104
to these fair parts?

06:05.139 --> 06:06.706
The, uh, paperback is coming out,

06:06.740 --> 06:09.408
and we're doing a little
signing/reading in Venice.

06:09.443 --> 06:10.510
I want you guys to come.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.145
Oh, God, would that we could,

06:12.179 --> 06:13.546
but we have too much with the packing.

06:13.580 --> 06:14.881
It's overwhelming, really,

06:14.915 --> 06:17.517
and we got to set our
affairs in order, so to speak.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.319
No, I... I... that's all taken care of.

06:20.354 --> 06:23.322
I... I said yes already,

06:23.357 --> 06:25.591
- that we'd go.
- Of course you did.

06:25.626 --> 06:28.227
Well, and also, Mia wants to

06:28.262 --> 06:30.062
introduce us to someone.

06:30.097 --> 06:33.166
Oh, a parole officer, perhaps?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.369
A boyfriend, and it's serious, right?

06:36.403 --> 06:38.437
Yeah, well, he is pretty great.

06:38.472 --> 06:39.705
Is it love?

06:39.740 --> 06:42.074
Well, what does... what
does she know of love?

06:42.109 --> 06:44.677
She's far too young to
speak on such matters.

06:44.711 --> 06:47.680
Too young? Hank,
didn't you get the memo?

06:47.714 --> 06:49.448
I'm totally legal now.

06:49.483 --> 06:50.650
Good to know.

06:50.684 --> 06:52.185
Man, this is gonna be
just way too much fun.

06:52.219 --> 06:53.719
Right?

06:53.754 --> 06:55.588
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay home and watch Becca?

06:55.622 --> 06:57.256
- Because...
- What is wrong with you?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.357
I don't deserve to have this much fun.

06:58.392 --> 06:59.425
[Phone ringing] You know what?

06:59.459 --> 07:01.194
That's probably Becca right now.

07:01.228 --> 07:02.595
We're coming.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.863
Hello?

07:03.897 --> 07:05.531
Hey, sweetie, guess...

07:10.237 --> 07:12.772
Well, as much as I'd love
to stay and watch you squirm,

07:12.806 --> 07:14.540
I, uh... I got to get moving.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.742
But I'll see you tonight,
right? I'm looking forward to it.

07:16.777 --> 07:19.045
So am I... so much so. Okay.

07:19.079 --> 07:21.047
And just so you know,
after all this time,

07:21.081 --> 07:23.182
you still make me a little wet.

07:25.452 --> 07:26.686
Toodle-loo!

07:29.756 --> 07:31.390
I'm shuttering the agency.

07:31.425 --> 07:34.060
What? Why?

07:34.094 --> 07:35.561
[chuckles]

07:35.596 --> 07:39.232
Yeah, it's time this old broad
hung up her dancing shoes,

07:39.266 --> 07:41.234
time I kicked back,

07:41.268 --> 07:45.771
relaxed, spent a little
quality time with my Dickie.

07:45.806 --> 07:49.642
So many positions left to explore.

07:51.311 --> 07:55.014
And I have to work on this.

07:55.048 --> 07:57.149
What am be dat?

07:57.184 --> 07:58.784
My memoir.

07:58.819 --> 08:02.355
Wow.

08:02.389 --> 08:05.258
I would love to read it sometime.

08:05.292 --> 08:07.260
Oh, I want you to read it.

08:07.294 --> 08:10.096
And then I want you to sell it.

08:10.130 --> 08:12.164
That's right, Runkle.

08:12.199 --> 08:13.666
I want you to be my agent.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.868
What are you talking
about, Sue? You fired me.

08:15.903 --> 08:17.837
Look, Runkle, whether
you know it or not,

08:17.871 --> 08:20.039
you're a Maverick, a renegade.

08:20.073 --> 08:23.542
You beat off to the
March of your own drummer.

08:23.577 --> 08:25.678
That's the kind of agent I want.

08:25.712 --> 08:29.048
That's the kind of agent
I've always tried to be.

08:29.082 --> 08:30.783
[chuckling]

08:30.817 --> 08:33.552
And in the meantime,

08:33.587 --> 08:35.554
you can take me.

08:35.589 --> 08:36.889
[sighs]

08:36.924 --> 08:39.392
Oh, okay, I see where this is going.

08:39.426 --> 08:41.227
You're dangling
your memoirs--

08:41.260 --> 08:43.395
which I know I can sell the
shit out of, by the way...

08:43.429 --> 08:46.966
as an excuse to continue
our torrid little affair.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.101
[Groaning]

08:49.136 --> 08:53.139
I don't see why the two
cannot peacefully coexist.

08:53.173 --> 08:55.408
Because I love my wife, Sue.

08:55.442 --> 08:57.376
We're on a serious upswing now.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.413
And I am sick and tired of
your constant sexual harassment.

09:00.447 --> 09:01.747
You say harassment.

09:01.782 --> 09:05.685
I say a couple of big, juicy
orgasms between friends.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.753
All right, we'll have it your way...

09:07.788 --> 09:09.989
completely professional.

09:10.023 --> 09:11.190
Thank you, Sue.

09:11.224 --> 09:13.526
Utterly boring.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.028
Aw...

09:16.063 --> 09:20.833
[Sighs] Collini... wet.

09:27.474 --> 09:28.941
Love the writing...

09:28.976 --> 09:31.410
so visceral and real.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.546
Who are some of your influences?

09:33.580 --> 09:36.248
Oh, God, uh, there are so many.

09:36.283 --> 09:38.951
Um, but if I had to narrow it down,

09:38.986 --> 09:42.121
I guess I'd have to say Bukowski...

09:42.155 --> 09:43.723
[groaning]

09:43.757 --> 09:46.792
Um, Nabokov.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.894
But I guess the writer
who really shaped me,

09:48.929 --> 09:50.930
the one who was my last true influence

09:50.964 --> 09:53.265
before I started doing
this professionally,

09:53.300 --> 09:55.601
that would have to be Hank Moody.

09:55.635 --> 09:56.802
[Applause]

09:56.837 --> 09:59.972
Oh, all right. Thank you.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.946
You're so Moody.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.415
You must be Hank and Karen.

10:09.449 --> 10:10.416
Yes.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.218
Paul Ryder, Mia's manager.

10:12.252 --> 10:14.020
- Oh, hey.
- Wow.

10:14.054 --> 10:15.354
Mia's got a manager now.

10:15.389 --> 10:16.989
- Uh-huh. - What is
this world coming to?

10:17.024 --> 10:19.258
[chuckles] Oh, you'd be surprised.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.293
Careers need guidance, nurturing.

10:21.328 --> 10:23.262
- Sure.
- You hear that? Nurturing.

10:23.296 --> 10:25.765
I suppose, if you're
into that sort of thing.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.801
Hey, I'm... I just...
I wanted to tell you,

10:28.835 --> 10:30.336
I'm a really big fan.

10:30.370 --> 10:31.837
- Oh.
- So...

10:31.872 --> 10:34.273
Anyway, Mia wanted me to invite you guys

10:34.307 --> 10:35.775
back to the house for a drink.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.076
- No.
- Yes.

10:37.110 --> 10:39.011
You will. You will see us later.

10:39.046 --> 10:40.312
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:40.347 --> 10:42.248
All right.

10:42.282 --> 10:43.749
What the fuck is wrong with you, woman?

10:43.784 --> 10:46.185
He's a big fan of yours, okay?

10:46.219 --> 10:47.453
It'll all be about you.

10:51.958 --> 10:56.162
Do you want to bone?

10:56.196 --> 10:58.297
Do I want to bone?

10:58.331 --> 11:00.633
Does the pope shit in the Vatican?

11:00.667 --> 11:02.134
- In the woods.
- What?

11:02.169 --> 11:03.335
Does the pope shit in the woods?

11:03.370 --> 11:04.837
That's the joke.

11:04.871 --> 11:06.205
I know. I modified it.

11:06.239 --> 11:09.108
That's what funny people do.

11:09.142 --> 11:10.810
Whatever, dude.

11:10.844 --> 11:14.780
You know, I have been thinking
about getting a reversal...

11:17.150 --> 11:20.386
of my vasectomy.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.288
- Why?
- Why?

11:22.322 --> 11:24.990
In case I want to have kids one day.

11:25.025 --> 11:27.660
Do you think that's a good idea?

11:30.030 --> 11:32.131
I think...

11:32.165 --> 11:33.532
Shut up and fuck me.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.701
I can do that.

11:37.170 --> 11:38.871
Oh...

11:38.905 --> 11:41.240
Party people everywhere, raise the roof.

11:41.274 --> 11:42.942
Hi, guys. I'm so glad you could make it.

11:42.976 --> 11:46.145
- Hey, you were great.
- Oh, thanks.

11:46.179 --> 11:48.814
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

11:48.849 --> 11:52.418
- Did you guys meet Paul?
- Yes.

11:52.452 --> 11:54.720
So where's the fella?

11:54.754 --> 11:57.790
This is my fellow.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.660
Your boyfriend is your manager?

12:01.695 --> 12:02.728
Uh-huh.

12:02.762 --> 12:04.663
Ow.

12:04.698 --> 12:08.534
[Laughter]

12:08.568 --> 12:10.536
So is there going to be a movie?

12:10.570 --> 12:12.471
Uh, it sure looks like it.

12:12.506 --> 12:14.006
We're talking to Evan Rachel Wood.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.374
Oh, my God, that's awesome.

12:15.408 --> 12:16.876
- She would be great.
- Rachel who?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.077
Yeah.

12:18.111 --> 12:19.478
The script's out to directors right now.

12:19.513 --> 12:21.480
Did... did you write
the script, sweetie?

12:21.515 --> 12:23.349
Oh, no.

12:23.383 --> 12:26.285
Screenwriting's not really
my thing... too many rules.

12:26.319 --> 12:27.653
I'll stick to fiction.

12:27.687 --> 12:30.256
Yeah, that's a good call.
You stick to fiction.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.391
[Muffled talking]

12:32.425 --> 12:33.659
Yeah, well, um,

12:33.693 --> 12:35.561
you know, I think Evan might
be around here somewhere

12:35.595 --> 12:36.896
do you want to meet her?

12:36.930 --> 12:37.997
I'll introduce you guys.

12:38.031 --> 12:39.965
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Who?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.536
Honey... okay, but I would like a kiss.

12:43.570 --> 12:45.571
Kiss me.

12:45.605 --> 12:47.773
[Muffled talking and moaning]

12:53.647 --> 12:55.581
So...

12:55.615 --> 12:56.649
Working on anything?

12:56.683 --> 12:57.683
Oh, God, no.

12:57.717 --> 12:59.185
Uh, just mostly my tan.

12:59.219 --> 13:00.686
I'm trying to get that all-over deal.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.821
It's hard to get the taint
nice and golden, though.

13:02.856 --> 13:05.324
I imagine so.

13:05.358 --> 13:07.059
It's been a while, though, huh,

13:07.093 --> 13:10.362
since you had something out there?

13:10.397 --> 13:12.965
Don't worry about me, buddy boy.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.099
Worry about Mia.

13:14.134 --> 13:17.002
I do worry about her.

13:17.037 --> 13:20.105
She's having some trouble
with her second book.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.274
I'm not surprised.

13:22.309 --> 13:23.409
Why?

13:26.513 --> 13:28.514
It's just that writing's hard, you know.

13:28.548 --> 13:30.683
Writing's fucking
hard, wunderkind or not.

13:30.717 --> 13:32.384
Fuck, yeah, it's hard.

13:32.419 --> 13:33.419
Yeah.

13:33.453 --> 13:35.020
That's funny, because I thought

13:35.055 --> 13:37.723
you were meaning it
because she didn't write

13:37.757 --> 13:39.792
"Fucking & Punching" in the first place.

13:43.964 --> 13:45.531
I don't know what you're
talking about, friend.

13:45.565 --> 13:47.666
That's between you and your client.

13:49.569 --> 13:51.403
[sighs]

13:51.438 --> 13:53.739
Her publisher asked her to write

13:53.773 --> 13:57.009
some extra pages for the paperback.

13:57.043 --> 13:58.844
She told me she
couldn't... too stressed.

13:58.878 --> 14:01.814
So I took care of it,
managed expectations,

14:01.848 --> 14:04.216
told them the road was taking its toll.

14:04.251 --> 14:05.451
They bought it.

14:05.485 --> 14:07.653
No big deal.

14:07.687 --> 14:10.222
I had a feeling...

14:10.257 --> 14:13.292
So I kept pressing her to
show me some more pages.

14:13.326 --> 14:16.061
She finally did, and they were rambling,

14:16.096 --> 14:18.964
incoherent, pretentious.

14:18.999 --> 14:22.334
Ot the same voice behind
"Fucking & Punching"...

14:22.369 --> 14:24.803
not even close, night and day.

14:24.838 --> 14:28.540
So I start asking questions.

14:28.575 --> 14:30.776
Didn't take long.

14:30.810 --> 14:33.712
She broke down, told me everything.

14:38.652 --> 14:41.620
Everything?

14:41.655 --> 14:44.890
Quite the literary
scandal we have here...

14:44.924 --> 14:48.861
which is not a bad thing necessarily.

14:48.895 --> 14:52.197
What the fuck is that suppose to mean?

14:52.232 --> 14:55.134
Think about it, Hank?

14:55.168 --> 14:57.569
What if she came clean?

14:57.604 --> 14:59.605
Told the story behind the story.

14:59.639 --> 15:02.975
Her fame suddenly becomes
something else entirely,

15:03.009 --> 15:04.877
something I can work with.

15:04.911 --> 15:06.512
Who knows? Maybe she goes on Oprah,

15:06.546 --> 15:07.846
a fucking reality show...

15:07.881 --> 15:09.782
I don't know. I'm just spitballing here.

15:09.816 --> 15:11.116
But it's better than fading away,

15:11.151 --> 15:13.952
and best of all, you
get your book back...

15:13.987 --> 15:15.654
maybe some infamy of your own.

15:15.689 --> 15:16.789
The publishing world

15:16.823 --> 15:19.558
knows you as this brilliant train wreck.

15:19.592 --> 15:21.927
Let everyone else in on it.

15:21.961 --> 15:26.432
I can get you a
tell-all deal like that.

15:26.466 --> 15:30.502
You think this shit is funny?

15:30.537 --> 15:33.505
No, I think it's a fucking disaster.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.108
My biggest client is a fraud.

15:36.142 --> 15:37.676
I'm trying to make the
best of a bad situation.

15:37.711 --> 15:40.679
Fuck you. You're trying to
capitalize on a bad situation.

15:40.714 --> 15:42.448
Look, I know that you're all pissed off

15:42.482 --> 15:45.017
at the world right now, and
you want to take it out on me.

15:45.051 --> 15:46.318
But just remember,

15:46.353 --> 15:47.820
I'm not the one that
fucked an underage girl.

15:47.854 --> 15:51.724
At least I waited till she was 18.

15:51.758 --> 15:52.825
Hey.

15:52.859 --> 15:55.527
Are you boys getting along?

15:55.562 --> 15:58.297
Famously.

15:58.331 --> 16:00.733
- Hey, sweetie.
- Isn't he a genius, Hank?

16:00.767 --> 16:03.502
Oh, please, I'm a mere businessman.

16:03.536 --> 16:05.671
You artists are the real geniuses.

16:05.705 --> 16:08.073
To Mia...

16:08.108 --> 16:10.309
And to her greatest influence.

16:26.059 --> 16:29.528
Yes, you certainly could
be in a lot of trouble.

16:29.562 --> 16:31.330
But I didn't know.

16:31.364 --> 16:32.831
Doesn't matter.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.833
It's your word against hers, and sorry,

16:34.868 --> 16:37.736
but no one believes a
word out of your mouth.

16:37.771 --> 16:40.005
I thought I was charming.

16:40.039 --> 16:41.740
- Not that charming.

16:46.146 --> 16:48.213
- Hank!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa.

16:48.248 --> 16:51.216
[Girls laughing]

16:51.251 --> 16:54.920
Hey.

16:54.954 --> 16:56.221
Karen!

16:56.256 --> 16:58.791
- Hey!
- Come on. Stop!

16:58.825 --> 17:00.893
- Oh, Hank!

17:00.927 --> 17:04.229
[Girls laughing]

17:08.835 --> 17:12.237
- Don't go.
- Don't leave. Stay with us.

17:12.271 --> 17:14.573
- Becca!
- Stay!

17:18.178 --> 17:19.310
Karen!

17:22.449 --> 17:23.515
Karen!

17:47.674 --> 17:49.174
I think she's talking about Rexy.

17:49.209 --> 17:51.343
Isn't that where she's
like, "he's just so stupid"?

17:51.377 --> 17:54.713
[Both laughing]

17:56.549 --> 17:58.217
Are you okay?

17:58.251 --> 17:59.585
Yeah, I'm good.

17:59.619 --> 18:03.856
I just, uh... I didn't
sleep very well last night.

18:03.890 --> 18:05.624
Okay, well...

18:05.658 --> 18:07.059
Hey, why don't you, um...

18:07.093 --> 18:09.528
why don't you take this
sourpuss out for a walk

18:09.562 --> 18:11.663
or something, all right?

18:11.698 --> 18:13.665
I've got... I've got
so much packing to do.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.800
I'm so excited!

18:27.347 --> 18:30.349
[Door opens, closes]

18:33.186 --> 18:36.655
You know what I'm going to miss?

18:36.689 --> 18:38.657
These walks.

18:38.691 --> 18:41.827
When I think back on L.A.,
that's what I'll remember.

18:44.464 --> 18:46.131
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Did you say something?

18:46.165 --> 18:48.600
Never mind.

18:50.203 --> 18:53.238
There's something I have to tell you.

18:53.273 --> 18:55.274
Dad?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.909
All right, go for it.

18:56.943 --> 18:59.344
I haven't told mom yet.

18:59.379 --> 19:03.248
For some reason, I feel like
I need to tell you first.

19:03.283 --> 19:04.616
Okay.

19:04.651 --> 19:07.819
The other night, when I
slept over at Chelsea's...

19:07.854 --> 19:09.087
Yeah.

19:09.122 --> 19:10.222
We snuck out.

19:10.256 --> 19:11.390
Becca.

19:11.424 --> 19:14.192
It's not as bad as it sounds, dad.

19:14.227 --> 19:18.697
And wouldn't you rather I
be honest about this stuff?

19:18.731 --> 19:20.899
Yes, of course. Okay.

19:20.934 --> 19:22.067
Go ahead.

19:22.101 --> 19:25.504
So we were just wandering around campus,

19:25.538 --> 19:27.839
and we met these boys.

19:27.874 --> 19:29.474
Okay, now I'm vaguely nauseous.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.109
Just bear with me, okay?

19:31.144 --> 19:32.144
Mm-hmm.

19:32.178 --> 19:33.745
Well, Chelsea immediately hooked up

19:33.780 --> 19:35.247
with the dickish good-looking one

19:35.281 --> 19:38.450
and spent the night in his dorm room.

19:38.484 --> 19:41.486
I ended up "sexiled" with the nerd...

19:41.521 --> 19:42.821
the Michael Cera type.

19:42.855 --> 19:43.989
Michael who?

19:44.023 --> 19:45.023
t doesn't matter.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.291
The point is,

19:46.326 --> 19:48.226
we ended up walking and
talking all night long.

19:48.261 --> 19:50.562
He was really sweet, a total gentleman.

19:50.597 --> 19:54.600
All right, well, I
like the sound of that.

19:54.634 --> 19:56.935
He did kiss me, though.

19:56.970 --> 19:58.737
Here comes another wave.

19:58.771 --> 20:01.940
It was nice to have a
boy want to kiss you.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.743
He tried to go further,
but I stopped him.

20:04.777 --> 20:06.011
Ah, that's my girl.

20:06.045 --> 20:07.479
He was totally sweet about it.

20:07.513 --> 20:09.147
- Okay.
- Very understanding.

20:09.182 --> 20:10.282
Sounds good.

20:10.316 --> 20:12.351
Heard me out, didn't push it.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.685
That's great. All right.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.087
But we did it anyway.

20:15.121 --> 20:16.655
Right...

20:16.689 --> 20:17.823
Wait, what?

20:17.857 --> 20:20.292
What... you did... you did what?

20:20.326 --> 20:21.593
Don't be mad at me, okay?

20:21.628 --> 20:22.995
I don't know if I could
take that right now.

20:23.029 --> 20:24.329
But...

20:24.364 --> 20:26.231
We used protection. He
had a condom in his wallet

20:26.265 --> 20:28.600
that he said had been
there since high school.

20:28.635 --> 20:31.269
It wasn't love, and it
wasn't perfect or anything.

20:31.304 --> 20:33.739
But I'm glad I did
it. I got it over with.

20:33.773 --> 20:35.941
- But...
- And I wanted to tell you first

20:35.975 --> 20:37.175
because I wanted you to know

20:37.210 --> 20:39.611
[voice breaking] that
you didn't fuck me up.

20:39.646 --> 20:42.247
My life is tough and weird
and unpleasant sometimes,

20:42.281 --> 20:43.682
but I walk around knowing

20:43.716 --> 20:46.418
that I have parents who
love me, who care about me,

20:46.452 --> 20:51.056
who always try their best,
even if they screw up sometimes.

20:51.090 --> 20:53.892
I know I gave you a hard
time when mom was gone,

20:53.926 --> 20:56.428
but I hope you know
that I love you, dad.

20:56.462 --> 20:57.629
And I always will.

21:06.172 --> 21:08.240
All right.

21:08.274 --> 21:11.376
Um...

21:11.411 --> 21:13.178
Can you, uh...

21:13.212 --> 21:16.348
Can you wait till New York
to tell your mom about this?

21:16.382 --> 21:17.816
Okay.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.651
Okay.

21:23.656 --> 21:26.558
I'm a woman now, dad.

21:28.728 --> 21:30.395
Oh...

22:24.050 --> 22:25.884
You don't want to do this.

22:25.918 --> 22:26.952
Do what, Hank?

22:26.986 --> 22:28.453
Come on, don't fuck with me.

22:28.488 --> 22:30.021
You must have some
idea what he's thinking.

22:30.056 --> 22:31.223
Why would you tell him?

22:31.257 --> 22:32.991
Because I'm in love with him.

22:33.025 --> 22:35.227
People in love tell
each other everything.

22:35.261 --> 22:38.196
Well, maybe not in your case.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.799
Mia, you can do better than this guy.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.933
You can.

22:41.968 --> 22:44.202
Oh, yeah? Who's better, you?

22:44.237 --> 22:46.538
This past year has been
a roller-coaster ride,

22:46.572 --> 22:48.273
and he's been the only
one taking care of me.

22:48.307 --> 22:49.441
Come on, I know you.

22:49.475 --> 22:50.876
You're a mischievous little fuck,

22:50.910 --> 22:52.344
but you're not malicious.

22:52.378 --> 22:53.678
Forget about me.

22:53.713 --> 22:56.448
Think about Karen,
and think about Becca.

22:56.482 --> 22:57.749
This is gonna hurt them.

22:57.784 --> 22:59.451
Is that what you want?

22:59.485 --> 23:01.787
Look, it's my story to tell,

23:01.821 --> 23:04.422
and my story includes the
fact that I seduced you.

23:04.457 --> 23:06.424
You didn't know how old I was.

23:06.459 --> 23:09.294
It's not like I'm going to
press charges or anything.

23:09.328 --> 23:11.163
You really think that
matters at this point?

23:11.197 --> 23:12.464
Karen loves you.

23:12.498 --> 23:14.800
She treated you like you
were her own daughter.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.935
And Becca looks up to
you like a big sister.

23:22.175 --> 23:24.543
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.711
It doesn't feel so
great, though, you know,

23:26.746 --> 23:28.213
to be famous for no reason.

23:28.247 --> 23:30.649
Sometimes I can go
along with it just fine,

23:30.683 --> 23:34.886
and I remember...

23:34.921 --> 23:36.888
That's the thing about secrets, Hank,

23:36.923 --> 23:39.457
they have a funny way of coming out.

23:39.492 --> 23:41.927
You okay, baby?

23:41.961 --> 23:46.298
I'm fine... fine.

23:46.332 --> 23:47.632
Can you just fuck off?

23:47.667 --> 23:49.534
Give us five minutes?

23:49.569 --> 23:51.803
Hank, it doesn't have to be this way.

23:51.838 --> 23:53.805
We could all just put
our heads together.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.040
We could figure out the best way

23:55.074 --> 23:56.641
to approach this whole thing.

23:56.676 --> 23:58.443
I know that you don't
want to upset your family.

23:58.477 --> 23:59.778
I'm sensitive to that.

23:59.812 --> 24:02.614
Really? Yeah, okay.
You're sensitive to that.

24:02.648 --> 24:04.883
You don't know anything about my family.

24:04.917 --> 24:08.119
No, not much. I'll admit to that.

24:08.154 --> 24:09.721
But from what I do know,

24:09.755 --> 24:12.657
you're not exactly the model patriarch.

24:23.135 --> 24:25.937
Stop! Hank!

24:25.972 --> 24:27.505
Hank! Stop!

24:27.540 --> 24:29.441
Hank! Stop! Stop!

24:29.475 --> 24:31.042
Hank!

24:35.648 --> 24:37.182
You're fucked, Moody.

24:37.216 --> 24:39.150
I'm calling the police.

24:53.199 --> 24:55.634
Hey, you!

24:55.668 --> 24:59.471
I'm almost done!

24:59.505 --> 25:00.872
Proud of me?

25:04.710 --> 25:05.944
Are you excited?

25:08.781 --> 25:10.482
Oh, my God! What happened?

25:10.516 --> 25:11.917
What the fuck happened to you?

25:11.951 --> 25:13.985
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

25:14.020 --> 25:15.186
- I got into a fight.
- What?

25:15.221 --> 25:16.755
- What do you mean?
- It's okay.

25:16.789 --> 25:17.756
- I have, um...
- Hank!

25:17.790 --> 25:19.391
No, it's... I just...

25:19.425 --> 25:22.394
What?

25:22.428 --> 25:23.862
I need to tell you something.

25:23.896 --> 25:25.230
Okay. What is it...

25:25.264 --> 25:26.598
Um...

25:26.632 --> 25:29.634
Hank?

25:29.669 --> 25:30.802
What?

25:30.836 --> 25:31.903
What could possibly be this bad?

25:31.938 --> 25:33.171
You look...

25:34.473 --> 25:37.409
- Âª she packed my bags last night pre

25:40.446 --> 25:43.882

26:27.760 --> 26:31.229
