02:08.627 --> 02:11.222
- So...
- So...

02:11.398 --> 02:13.764
- Happy birthday.
- Oh.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.662
Thank you...

02:15.935 --> 02:17.197
...for the takeout.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.496
Sure.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.866
It's the least I could do.
It's your birthday.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.835
- Heh. So?
- Oh, yeah, right.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.241
But Dan's home
so we gotta go to the bedroom.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.905
Oh. Are we done in here?

02:30.450 --> 02:32.179
Yeah, well, we finished eating.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.114
What?

02:36.856 --> 02:39.723
I just thought
that this might be a great moment...

02:39.893 --> 02:41.952
...for you to give me my gift.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.692
Oh, shit.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.960
Amy, I didn't get you anything.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.998
You told me that you didn't want me
to get you anything.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.209
What's happening? Oh, God.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.401
- Are you crying?
- No.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.240
I have missed something here, baby.
So you wanted a present?

03:03.416 --> 03:06.249
Garrett,
I tell you not to get me something...

03:06.419 --> 03:08.683
...so you want to get me something
really great...

03:08.855 --> 03:11.551
...because I'm the girlfriend
that didn't ask for anything.

03:11.724 --> 03:15.387
What? Okay, you know what, let's go.
I'll get you something now.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.621
It is not about the goddamn gift.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.891
It just was about the gift.
When did it become not about the gift?

03:21.067 --> 03:25.060
It's bigger than this.
It's a combination of a lot of things.

03:25.371 --> 03:29.432
I've invested so much in this relationship
and I don't feel like you're doing the same.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.171
I don't even know if you're into this.
Are you?

03:34.581 --> 03:36.811
- Sure.
- Oh, my God.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.382
Ah, Amy, come on.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.078
- Don't even think about calling me again.
- Oh, Jesus. Amy, wait, wait, wait.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.587
I should not call you
or I should want to call you?

03:45.792 --> 03:49.558
Okay, so it means what it means. Good.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.437
- Ow! Oh, my God. Mother bitch.
- Erin, you're late.

04:00.607 --> 04:04.043
Thanks, Brandy.
I almost forgot why I was running.

04:09.649 --> 04:11.446
Did he use the red pen with you guys?

04:11.618 --> 04:12.880
No.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.113
- Well, it's impressive reporting.
- Thank you.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.226
However,
needs to be completely restructured.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.362
And a spellcheck wouldn't hurt.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.397
"Munincibal" courthouse?
Not sure where that is.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.895
Thank you, ladies.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.642
- Where are you going?
- I'm 31. I'm an intern.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.973
- I'm going to get wasted.
- Oh, I'm so in.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.615
Let's go.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.277
I'd love a copilot. Look at this shit.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.511
Oh, my God, he bled on it.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.583
I still can't believe
she broke up with me.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.491
- Of course she did, dumb-ass.
- Because I didn't get a gift?

04:57.664 --> 04:58.688
It's not the gift.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.594
- Don't think it's the gift.
- It's not.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.429
How does everyone except me
know it's not about the gift?

05:03.603 --> 05:06.470
- Oh. Dude, are you kidding me?
- All right, hang on a second, man.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.267
I get it, all right?
It's a tough thing to get dumped.

05:09.442 --> 05:12.502
You get upset, you go to your room,
you turn off all the lights...

05:12.679 --> 05:15.147
...you light a candle
and you just, like you know...

05:15.315 --> 05:18.182
...go to that deep emotional place
where you're like:

05:22.322 --> 05:24.222
- Is that really how you cry?
- Yes.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.051
Are you going through that?
Have you cried?

05:26.226 --> 05:29.889
- Uh, I didn't cry. I've never cried like that.
- I cry like that all the time.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.464
I've only really cried over a girl
in, like, high school, maybe.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.067
I don't know.
Maybe you weren't into that chick.

05:36.236 --> 05:39.933
Because I didn't cry, it means I'm not...
No, I liked her. Of course I liked her.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.768
And we were good together.
I don't know what happened.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.773
Aw, dude.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.411
- This happens every time.
- What?

05:46.579 --> 05:49.207
You get in a relationship
but you don't fully commit.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.481
You never have,
not since I've known you.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.585
The girl figures that out and she splits.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.189
And then we have to sit here
and listen to you be surprised about that.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.019
- Over and over again. This happens a lot.
- All the time.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.354
It's not true. It happens occasionally.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.790
There's a definite pattern.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.487
You know what?

06:05.665 --> 06:08.225
Fuck you, fuck you.
I'm gonna go clear my head.

06:08.401 --> 06:11.131
- A lot of self-righteousness going on.
- You gonna cry it out?

06:11.304 --> 06:13.363
I'm not crying, just gonna clear my head.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.632
Clear your head, cry, same thing.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.072
You know what I'm talking about
with the man cry.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.541
Like that low, like:

06:22.949 --> 06:26.817
I don't know. If you ask me, that looks
like you're trying to suck your own dick.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.519
- That does not...
- Yes, it does.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.178
If I wasn't making any noise...

06:30.356 --> 06:32.790
...and you saw me like this,
what does it look like?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.755
Looks like you're trying to suck your dick.
That's not how.

06:35.928 --> 06:39.489
When I suck my dick, I lie on my back,
I throw my legs over my head.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.731
- You suck your own dick?
- Yeah.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.133
You cut your hair
and you suck your own dick.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.773
You're like a Swiss army knife.

06:58.384 --> 07:01.182
Hey, we should circulate.
There's hot guys everywhere.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.616
You're being lame.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.256
What would you rather I do?

07:04.424 --> 07:07.393
Get date-raped by a frat guy
with a popped collar?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.720
No, thank you.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.487
You are just jealous.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.063
- More for you, baby.
- Thank you.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.666
Go have fun being in <i>The Accused.</i>

07:16.369 --> 07:17.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.136
- I like your shirt.
- I know. It's Polo.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.100
You smell good.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.402
- It's Axe.
- I know.

07:34.821 --> 07:39.087
You might as well remove that quarter.
I have no intention of getting off this game.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.819
Listen...

07:43.996 --> 07:45.088
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:45.264 --> 07:46.663
- Who does that?
- What the fuck?

07:46.833 --> 07:49.529
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

07:49.702 --> 07:52.967
Who leans in like that?
I was just about to beat the high score.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.438
There's no way you got that close to ERL.
I've never gotten that close.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.975
You know how long
I've been trying to beat myself?

07:59.178 --> 08:00.873
I mean, what a dick move.

08:02.281 --> 08:03.612
Wait, what?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.815
What the f...?

08:05.985 --> 08:09.614
What? Hold on. Hold on. You're ERL?
You're the dragon?

08:10.056 --> 08:11.216
I'm a what?

08:11.424 --> 08:14.518
I've been chasing ERL for months now.
I just thought ERL was an...

08:14.694 --> 08:17.822
I thought ERL was an "Earl," you know.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.558
Erin Rankin Langford.
Nobody calls me ERL.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.066
I'm honored, okay. I am honored.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.865
Shit, what a dick. I leaned in.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.640
I owe you a beer.
Please let me get you a beer.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.243
Look, I'm sitting right over there,
we got a pitcher.

08:32.445 --> 08:37.178
I'd feel like shit if you don't have a beer
with me. One Centipedophile to another.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.578
All right.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.482
- I feel like you're not listening to me.
- I am listening.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.681
I'm trying to figure this out.
I can't tell if they're together.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.917
I think they're on their first date. Tall.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.257
Yes, I see them. They're tall.
But are you not afraid about what's...

08:51.464 --> 08:54.365
- I bet the blond played college sports.
- Can you pay attention?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.401
There are no baby pigeons in the city.
Not one.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.561
You guys, uh, I want you to meet Erin.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.003
Uh, Erin, these are my friends.
This is Box and Dan.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.870
Hi. How are you?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.271
- Hey.
- Hello.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.572
I screwed up Erin's Centipede game
so I owe her a beer.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.682
Fucker put his face
in front of the game.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.283
- What? Who does that?
- Oh.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.578
- Exactly.
- Well, it wasn't that bad.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.283
Check, one.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.956
Okay, everyone, people.

09:18.658 --> 09:22.355
It is time for tonight's round
of bar trivia.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.531
So you know the rules.
Uh, just teams of two.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.032
No fighting, no g...

09:31.404 --> 09:34.862
Oh! Shit!
Terry, I just got shocked by this mike.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.804
Well, then don't put your face on it.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.603
I do not have health care, Terry.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.846
Hey, listen, these two get really moody
and emotional when they're separated...

09:44.016 --> 09:45.881
...so do you wanna team up?
- Sure.

09:46.052 --> 09:49.078
Just don't drag me down, okay?
You don't seem very smart.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.291
What country has the driest inhabited area
in the world?

09:54.460 --> 09:55.757
Is it A, Syria...?

09:55.928 --> 09:57.020
Egypt.

09:57.196 --> 10:01.132
Okay, let me read all the choices
before you answer.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.294
Egypt, the answer's Egypt.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.437
Nice. Oh, my God.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.802
What album holds the record
for most weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> 200?

10:08.975 --> 10:10.306
<i>Dark Side of the Moon.</i>

10:10.476 --> 10:13.775
- Terry, they keep interrupting me.
- Then speak faster.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.346
Seven hundred and 41 weeks,
in case you're curious.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.349
You suck at everything else.
It's good you know something.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.215
Yeah, well, I better not suck at that.
It's part of my job.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.856
I work at Diesel Records. It's a label.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.816
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.858
The word "records"
kind of tipped me off.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.460
What do you do for work?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.564
I work at <i>The New York Sentinel</i>
newspaper.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.393
- Oh, yeah?
- It's a newspaper.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.263
How many different ways
can you make change for a dollar?

10:37.436 --> 10:40.701
Ah! A dollar, if ripped, has no value.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.340
Disqualified.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.305
Great, nine weeks in a row.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.474
- You got a little wing sauce, like... Um...
- Where?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.046
Kind of in this general area.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.343
The Rolling Stones took their name
from what...?

10:52.518 --> 10:54.884
- Muddy Waters!
- Fuck you!

11:02.628 --> 11:03.652
Oh, yeah.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.888
Oh, wow.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.794
Jesus, Snoop.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.295
So you a big fan of Tom Cruise?

11:11.771 --> 11:14.638
Uh, in my defense, I'm a big <i>Top Gun</i> fan.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.832
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:17.009 --> 11:21.537
In fact, I like all homoerotic,
fighter-pilot movies.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.877
- Too much? Did I lose you?
- No, no.

11:26.052 --> 11:29.146
Is <i>Top Gun</i> like your favorite movie?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.586
- It's up there. What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.588
- It's the greatest.
- Yeah. It's awesome.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.351
Wait, what's your favorite movie?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.395
Actually, I'm gonna be really serious
right now for a minute.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.293
- Okay, hold on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.335
I really wanna tell you
what my favorite movie is.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.898
Oh, God. Please don't say, like,
<i>Triumph of the Will.</i>

11:48.074 --> 11:52.010
Don't be like a closet Nazi
or something weird...

11:52.178 --> 11:54.112
...because this is going great.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.207
It's <i>Shawshank.</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:03.715
I hope I make it across the border.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.790
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.327
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.226
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I hope.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.767
- Zihuatanejo.
- Zihuatanejo.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.527
The best.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.845
<i>Watching every motion</i>
<i>In my foolish lover's game</i>

12:31.017 --> 12:33.076
- Where's that coming from?
- Dan.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.584
- How in the fuck is <i>Top Gun</i> music playing?
- Dan!

12:35.755 --> 12:37.882
- Hey, Garrett.
- I'm so sorry.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.082
I forgot to tell you
that Dan's my roommate.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.726
You guys live together?

12:42.194 --> 12:44.094
- Uh, yeah.
- Hey, Dan!

12:44.263 --> 12:45.389
Hello in there.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.498
- Heh.
- Uh...

12:47.667 --> 12:48.759
Dan, what are you doing?

12:49.168 --> 12:51.602
Watching every motion
in my foolish lover's game?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.397
What was our rule?

12:54.573 --> 12:57.804
Because I can hear through the wall
doesn't mean I get to participate.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.003
Right,
and what were you doing just now?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.107
- Participating.
- Okay.

13:03.282 --> 13:07.514
Look, man, I just thought maybe,
you know, it'd be fun if I DJ'd your hookup.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.884
So is this, like, what you guys do
when you bring girls over?

13:11.057 --> 13:13.355
- He DJs your hookup?
- No.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.790
Is that what this fucking frat house
is all about?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.088
No, no. Listen, I'm really sorry.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.858
- I'm gonna go.
- Listen, listen, listen. I can explain.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.466
Yeah? Explain.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.605
You know what? I can't. I really have
no save here. He is a fucking moron.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.570
That's okay, because, you know what?
I was totally pretending to be mad.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.334
I didn't want you to think I was slutty.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.102
- I don't care.
- Oh.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.543
- Think it's kind of awesome.
- Well, that's weird.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.206
- In fact, Dan, take me to Berlin.
- Here it comes!

13:38.384 --> 13:42.514
<i>Take my breath away</i>

13:48.327 --> 13:52.661
<i>Take my breath away</i>

14:16.322 --> 14:18.449
Hey. Morning.

14:18.624 --> 14:19.648
Good morning.

14:20.893 --> 14:25.227
Um, if you're taking off, could you at least
leave the money on the nightstand?

14:25.631 --> 14:28.862
Oh. I wasn't, um, trying to sneak out.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.003
No. You're just putting your clothes on
really quietly...

14:32.171 --> 14:34.366
...and tiptoeing across the floor.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.837
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.744
I can stay.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.353
- I didn't mean you had to...
- Okay, yeah.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.889
That didn't feel good.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.391
Hey, hey.
You wanna maybe get some breakfast?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.627
Food would be good.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.027
Okay.

15:01.200 --> 15:07.366
<i>Now I've had the time of my life</i>

15:07.706 --> 15:09.469
<i>No, I've never felt</i>

15:09.642 --> 15:11.701
Hello.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.653
I had a great time last night.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.952
I gotta say, that was... It's a lot of fun.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.684
Me too.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.954
So I should get your number.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.157
You know, we'd maybe hang out again?

15:35.334 --> 15:38.064
- Okay.
- All right. I have a nap... No.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.262
- Here, I got it.
- Okay.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.274
- Um, there's a caveat that...
- Mm-hm.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.774
...I'd really... Um...

15:47.980 --> 15:50.915
I'm leaving in six weeks.

15:51.083 --> 15:55.110
And when I said that I work
at <i>The Sentinel...</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:57.187
...I meant that I'm a summer intern.

15:57.756 --> 16:02.489
And I'm actually going back to Stanford
to finish up my last year of grad school.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.824
And although I'd be psyched
to hang out again...

16:06.365 --> 16:11.803
...um, please know that
I'm not looking to start up...

16:11.971 --> 16:15.964
Oh, wait. Uh, no, me...?
I just got out of a relationship.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.606
- Oh. Really, when?
- Yeah.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.744
Um...

16:23.148 --> 16:25.878
I'm not gonna tell you
that it was last night...

16:26.051 --> 16:29.851
...but I'm not gonna say
that it wasn't either.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.456
- Okay, good.
- Yeah. Yep.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.786
Well, then we know
where each other stands.

16:35.227 --> 16:38.628
Um, the added bonus is that I now know
you're a male whore.

16:38.964 --> 16:42.456
Yeah. I guess l... It seems like I am.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.361
Here's my phone number.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.235
That's awesome.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.941
Best posture in the office, Allison.
Seriously. Best one we got.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.133
There he is.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.504
- How you doing?
- Hey.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.305
Hey, I got a question for you, man.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.041
How does someone like you end up getting
dumped and laid on the same night?

16:58.217 --> 17:02.620
How is that possible? I mean, from all of us
sad, Ionely and bitter people...

17:02.788 --> 17:04.847
...I encourage you
to eat a big bowl of dick.

17:05.457 --> 17:06.515
- Really? How about this?
- Mm-hm.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.489
How about, "Good morning, Garrett"?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.528
- Morning, Garrett.
- How you doing? What's with the luggage?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.894
Um, my flight from Miami got in at 5 a.m.
I haven't even slept.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.058
You would never know.
You look well-slept.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.204
Oh, thank you. Heh.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.929
How's, uh?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.570
- Mark...
- Mark.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.503
- Is great.

17:24.676 --> 17:28.443
Uh, seeing him once every six weeks
for 48 hours, not so great.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.673
- Yeah.
- Garrett? Can you come here a sec?

17:31.016 --> 17:32.176
- Yeah.
- Anyways.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.546
- All right. Well, wake up.
- Bye, boys.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.745
- She's still with that guy?
- Yeah.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.891
- You kidding me? But he lives in Miami.
- Yeah.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.253
Wait... No... Yeah, hold on.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.362
I don't think you understand
the gravity of this situation.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.794
I wanna put things of mine
inside things of hers.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.866
I know you do. I know.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.735
<i>I heart you crazy mad</i>

17:53.906 --> 17:55.203
<i>Until it feels so good</i>

17:55.374 --> 17:58.741
<i>I'm about to do something drastic</i>
<i>'Cause I gotta have it</i>

17:58.911 --> 18:00.105
- What is this?
- Mm-hm.

18:00.279 --> 18:04.238
<i>I heart you crazy mad</i>
<i>I'm in a panic 'cause I</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:05.883
I'm genuinely getting nauseous.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.511
<i>I'm going out of my head</i>

18:08.687 --> 18:10.814
Are they singing
"I heart you crazy mad"?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.550
Yeah, they are. Sadly, they are.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.986
Jesus. 3Z? Heh.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.356
Now comes the fun part...

18:18.530 --> 18:22.091
...because I get to look at your face
when I say I'm assigning them to you.

18:22.534 --> 18:23.967
- Ah, there it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.536
I know. I know it sucks.
Believe me, I know, okay?

18:26.705 --> 18:29.970
The higher-ups wanna sign these guys.
They could be our Jonas Brothers.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.337
Come on. Don't do this to me.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.645
What about all the bands
that I bring you?

18:34.813 --> 18:37.304
Demos you never listen to?
Give me a shot with those.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.314
- That's not our focus right now.
- Will...

18:39.485 --> 18:42.511
Hey. You know who I had to scout
when I was your age?

18:42.688 --> 18:46.624
Nelson and Jesus Jones. All right?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.692
You know one song. I know like 100.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.329
You know what that does
to your emotional stability?

18:51.497 --> 18:53.590
- You covered Jesus Jones?
- Yeah.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.597
How old are you?

18:57.336 --> 18:58.997
I don't wanna talk about that.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.163
Do this. Show the idiots in charge
that you wanna get promoted...

19:02.341 --> 19:04.332
...then you can make the call
on some bands.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.707
I can't look at them without la...
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.678
You'll figure it out. Unh.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.316
Close them.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.211
<i>So have they offered you a job yet?</i>

19:17.389 --> 19:19.186
It's nice to talk to you too, Corinne.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.552
<i>Have you even asked them?</i>

19:20.726 --> 19:23.422
Look, the whole newspaper business
is falling apart, okay?

19:23.595 --> 19:25.790
People here are struggling
to keep their jobs...

19:25.964 --> 19:27.727
...so I can't exactly ask for one.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.561
<i>Maya, statue.</i>

19:30.135 --> 19:32.695
<i>Look, all I'm saying,</i>
<i>and please know that I love you...</i>

19:32.871 --> 19:36.204
<i>...is that you are behind in your life,</i>
<i>and we all know why.</i>

19:36.375 --> 19:40.744
Yeah, I'm currently up to speed on the fact
that my life is not currently up to speed.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.275
<i>Maya, statue.</i>

19:44.850 --> 19:46.112
<i>Ooh, Olive Garden.</i>

19:47.920 --> 19:51.913
<i>- Jesus Chri... Phil!</i>
- <i>The pantry shelves just collapsed.</i>

19:52.424 --> 19:54.415
- <i>Erin?</i>
- Shit.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.584
<i>I need you to watch Maya for me, please.</i>

19:56.762 --> 20:00.198
Erin. All the other interns are doing
research so you're on desk duty.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.132
Okay.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.167
Hugh, wait.

20:05.337 --> 20:10.104
Look, I would really love
to turn this internship into a job.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.709
And it's fine that my last piece
didn't get picked...

20:12.878 --> 20:15.904
...and the ones that do
usually get bumped for space.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.708
But it is my dream to work here...

20:17.883 --> 20:19.976
...and I would like
to make a good impression.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.484
Good. Then do that.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.121
Okay.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.224
Um, well, is there a piece
you could assign me, or?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.450
A piece.

20:28.627 --> 20:32.290
Uh, the only thing I have is a human
interest story on Grant-A-Dream.

20:32.464 --> 20:34.932
- It's a charitable organization...
- Yes, Grant-A-Dream.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.592
It grants wishes to terminally ill children.
I love terminally ill children.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.466
Don't get too excited.
Four other people passed on this.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.438
- I'm on it.
- Okay, good.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.703
Uh, write it up, put it on my desk.
Thank you.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.311
Corinne... Ugh.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.449
<i>Thanks a lot, Erin.</i>
<i>Where did you get these Oreo cookies?</i>

20:58.624 --> 21:01.855
<i>Spit it out. Spit. More. More. More.</i>

21:02.027 --> 21:04.325
<i>All of it. All of it. Maya.</i>

21:04.496 --> 21:05.656
<i>All of it. All of it.</i>

21:10.002 --> 21:11.936
There's that. Thank you so much.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.535
- Hello?
- Hello.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.711
I see you haven't entered me
into your phone yet.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.246
<i>Oh, you know what happened?</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:27.317
- What's that?
- I forgot your name.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.510
Ah.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.212
That's too bad for me. Um...

21:31.390 --> 21:35.884
<i>Well, I, Garrett, was wondering</i>
<i>if you'd allow me to take you to dinner.</i>

21:36.061 --> 21:38.529
Um, yeah. I could eat.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.722
<i>Yeah? Great.</i>

21:40.933 --> 21:43.834
- All right, text me the address.
<i>- Okay.</i>

21:51.510 --> 21:53.171
What's your favorite food?

21:53.345 --> 21:57.304
Every Friday night, my family, we'd go out
to this place, Luigi's, in my hometown.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.949
I'd get tortellini.

21:59.117 --> 22:03.019
I think I love it just because of that.
It reminds me of Friday nights growing up.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.520
How would you like to die?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.392
- Eating too much tortellini.
- Ha-ha-ha.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.620
Or waterboarding.
I'd love to be waterboarded to death.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.631
Give me, like, three albums that you really
love, that meant something to you.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.462
<i>Licensed To III,</i> the Beastie Boys.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.570
Oh, the best.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.969
That was one because it was dangerous.
And I had no danger in my life.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.132
I thought like...
My idea of danger was like...

22:25.310 --> 22:27.403
...getting chocolate milk
from the lunch lady.

22:27.579 --> 22:30.480
Okay, what's the meanest lie
you've ever told someone...

22:30.649 --> 22:33.641
...to get them out in the morning?
- I had to meet my wife for breakfast.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.525
- Ready?
- There we go. Learn by doing.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.220
There it is.

22:46.398 --> 22:49.367
- That way. Love that. Love that.
- Yay!

22:49.534 --> 22:51.468
Okay, run. Wrong way.
Go the other way.

22:51.637 --> 22:52.661
Fuck!

22:55.440 --> 22:58.341
No, no, no! No!

23:15.160 --> 23:16.149
Ugh.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.796
- I mean, is that gonna go on all day?
- I don't know. Probably.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.431
We're staring directly at you.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.432
We're rowing
like a bunch of Viking slaves.

23:23.602 --> 23:26.127
- Come on, we're having fun here.
- We're staring at you.

23:40.686 --> 23:42.745
Do you wanna have kids?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.388
Why, you wanna take those kids?

23:44.556 --> 23:48.424
No, I mean, just like, you know,
later on in life, do you wanna have kids?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.185
Yeah, of course.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.556
Do you?

23:51.863 --> 23:52.989
I don't know.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.793
That's why I like coming
and looking at the old couples.

23:55.967 --> 24:00.370
Some of them seem genuinely, not only
happy, but sometimes I think, content.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.507
I think sometimes that's more important
than, like, happiness.

24:03.675 --> 24:06.769
Like the guy we saw in the plaid shirt
walking down... He's happy.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.142
The only way you're content in life
is if you marry your best friend.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.840
- They make each other laugh...
- So I have to marry Dan?

24:13.018 --> 24:14.952
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Or Box? They gotta duke it out.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.481
I'm having fun.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.122
Me too.

24:18.824 --> 24:21.759
- I'm only here for a couple more weeks.
- Right.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.951
But maybe you'll come back one day.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.762
- Pushing that deadline another day.
- Sure.

24:32.704 --> 24:33.762
See you.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.934
- Um, excuse me, Hugh? Hi.
- Oh, hey.

24:38.110 --> 24:42.171
Um, I just wanted to say goodbye
because it's my last day...

24:42.347 --> 24:43.405
Well, goodbye.

24:43.582 --> 24:47.484
I was curious, um, what did you think
of my Grant-A-Dream piece?

24:47.753 --> 24:49.744
Uh... Oh, it was good.
We're gonna run it.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.479
- You are?
- Yeah.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.123
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:53.291 --> 24:56.351
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah. Tuesday. Congratulations.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.189
- Nice piece of writing.
- Thank you.

24:58.363 --> 24:59.387
Yeah. Good work.

24:59.564 --> 25:02.328
I want you to know
what an incredible experience I had here.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.292
Good.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.164
Okay.

25:07.339 --> 25:11.605
Do you think that there's
any possible chance in the future...

25:11.777 --> 25:13.267
...that it could lead to a job?

25:14.579 --> 25:17.673
Well, look, you know,
you're a good writer...

25:17.849 --> 25:19.908
...and anything's possible...

25:20.085 --> 25:22.519
...so why don't you call me
after the new year, okay?

25:22.687 --> 25:25.850
- And we'll see where things are at.
- I will call you in January.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.787
- Okay, good. Perfect.
- Like, the first.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.359
- All right. Great.
- At like 5 a.m.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.828
Great, that's good, Erin. Thank you.
Just remember the time difference.

25:33.999 --> 25:37.093
- Okay. Bye, Hugh. Thank you.
- Take care. Okay, bye, now.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.402
Hey, you.

25:41.573 --> 25:44.371
<i>Good afternoon, is Erin there, please?</i>

25:44.543 --> 25:45.908
This is Erin.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.069
<i>Is it? Well, this is Garrett Austin Scully</i>
<i>telephoning.</i>

25:49.247 --> 25:52.216
<i>I met you at that bar</i>
<i>by the Centipede machine.</i>

25:52.384 --> 25:55.717
Yeah, I remember. Nice hair, decent face.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.377
<i>Ah. That's the one.</i>

25:57.556 --> 25:59.990
<i>Listen, I know this is your</i>
<i>last night in New York...</i>

26:00.158 --> 26:03.252
<i>...so I was wondering if you would</i>
<i>allow me to take you out...</i>

26:03.428 --> 26:05.862
<i>...for a nice farewell dinner.</i>

26:06.031 --> 26:07.896
I would love to.

26:13.271 --> 26:17.367
All right, I don't wanna impress you all
at once but these are actual cloth napkins.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.408
- That's genuine cloth, that's polyester.
- Ooh. Ha, ha.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.481
Yeah, not to put on airs or anything,
and all-you-can-eat garlic balls.

26:24.649 --> 26:30.110
Ha-ha-ha. Wow. You have really
outdone yourself, Mr. Scully.

26:30.622 --> 26:32.385
I will take that not sarcastically.

26:32.824 --> 26:33.848
Good evening.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.789
Um, can I get your drink order
to start with?

26:36.962 --> 26:38.429
- Should we get some wine?
- Yeah.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.758
- Do you have a list?
- Uh, we don't.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.060
We just have the one,
the jug of wine?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.431
It's a Sunshine Harbor?

26:46.605 --> 26:49.472
It's the house wine.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.506
And how is it?
How would you describe it?

26:51.676 --> 26:55.271
- Um, it's okay. You know.
- Well, there you go.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.608
Well done. Well played.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.910
I think the lady and I will partake
of the Sunshine Harbor...

27:01.086 --> 27:02.747
...per your glowing recommendation.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.979
- Um, now, what year is this?
- Uh...

27:05.156 --> 27:06.180
This.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.849
Nothing worse than an old wine.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.860
That's how I feel.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.327
- I'll be right back to get your order.
- Okay.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.292
Um, ahem.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.429
I just wanna thank you
for calling me a lady.

27:22.607 --> 27:28.978
Well, because you are a beautiful, funny,
intelligent woman...

27:29.481 --> 27:31.813
...who I've had
an amazing time with.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.712
Yeah, I'm bummed it's our last night.

27:34.719 --> 27:35.777
Me too.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.845
And I've...

27:38.089 --> 27:40.887
I don't think I've ever enjoyed
getting to know someone more.

27:41.526 --> 27:43.790
It's been such a good six weeks.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.220
Went by so fast.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.899
I can't really articulate.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.500
Six weeks too fast.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.233
Me like you.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.796
Wine.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.837
- Oh, my God.
- That's disgusting.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.539
You're lucky you didn't keep it in,
because I'm getting an ulcer.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.568
Well, I guess this is it.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.037
Yeah. Guess this is it.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.142
Take care of yourself.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.677
Okay.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.447
- Okay, bye.
- I'll s...

29:21.860 --> 29:24.988
- Uh... Oh, let me...
- I got it, I got it.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.113
Whoa, whoa.
You can't leave your car there.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.511
- No, l...
- You can't leave your car at the curb.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.845
- I need to talk to this girl quickly.
- Shit, you chasing a girl?

29:49.020 --> 29:50.954
- Yeah.
- For real?

29:51.122 --> 29:53.249
- Yeah.
- She got a nice ass?

29:53.725 --> 29:54.817
Like the wind.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.325
- What the hell does that mean?
- I have no idea.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.124
Please. Two seconds.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.363
- Go on, now.
- Thank you, thank you.

30:02.834 --> 30:05.564
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

30:12.343 --> 30:15.073
Langford. Hey!

30:15.280 --> 30:16.872
- What are you doing?
- That sucked.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.174
- I know.
- God.

30:18.349 --> 30:19.475
- That was terrible.
- Terrible.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.278
- I can't end it like this.
- Neither can I.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.011
And that car ride was a disaster.

30:23.188 --> 30:25.156
Oh, that was awful. It was so awkward.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.347
So awkward.

30:26.524 --> 30:27.821
- It's the worst.
- The worst.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.152
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.385
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.827
I didn't know if you wanted to keep
doing this or how you felt.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.523
I just... I freaked out, okay?

30:37.302 --> 30:39.031
I've had such a good time with you...

30:39.204 --> 30:41.331
...and a part of me
doesn't want that to end...

30:41.506 --> 30:44.373
...but I have been down this road before
with a guy.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.978
I dropped out of college and I followed him
across the country...

30:48.146 --> 30:50.876
...and I dropped everything for him.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.984
And that's why my timeline is all off,
you know?

30:54.152 --> 30:56.848
And now I finally got everything
back on track...

30:57.021 --> 30:58.852
...you know, with my life and school...

30:59.023 --> 31:01.583
...and then you had to come along...

31:01.760 --> 31:04.388
...and fuck that all up.
- Ow.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.163
I'm sorry.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.164
I'm not asking you to drop out of school
or even move here.

31:09.334 --> 31:14.033
I'm just asking to see you
because I don't wanna lose you.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.768
Fuck the miles. Fuck them.

31:17.942 --> 31:21.275
I'll be here and you'll be there
and we'll just be long-distance...

31:21.446 --> 31:24.813
...because quite frankly,
I'm crazy about you.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.578
I'm crazy about you too.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.430
I'm so glad you picked me up.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.191
Of course.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.393
Maya made you something.

31:47.338 --> 31:51.104
- She's here.
- Hi, everybody.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.410
- Hi. Hi, my beautiful niece.
- Hi.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.603
Hi.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.581
"The suspect, Mr. Jones...

31:57.749 --> 32:00.877
...was heavily intoxicated
when he fired the.44 Magnum."

32:01.052 --> 32:04.749
We need to know where this information
is coming from. Is this your own theory?

32:07.192 --> 32:09.319
- Aw, come on, man.
- Come on, dude.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.585
Are you serious?

32:10.762 --> 32:11.922
What are y...?

32:12.096 --> 32:13.563
- Hold on.
- "What are you doing?"

32:13.731 --> 32:15.665
"Nothing. What are you doing?"

32:15.834 --> 32:18.325
"Nothing.
This funny thing happened at work."

32:18.503 --> 32:20.266
"This funny thing happened at school."

32:26.010 --> 32:29.173
He sneezed and scared mommy panda.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.976
Oh, my God. Baby panda has a cold.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.518
I had a thing when I was a kid.
I was obsessed with, like...

32:39.691 --> 32:45.061
I thought it was cool to not have lips.
Like Michael J. Fox and Jason Bateman.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.891
Those guys, like, I idolized them.

32:47.098 --> 32:50.261
They didn't have, like, lips,
and I had, like, big weird lips.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.511
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.159
Look at that. You're up.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.358
You kidding me?

33:24.869 --> 33:27.337
What are you doing? Come on. Come...

33:27.505 --> 33:29.063
- What the fuck?
- Oh!

33:29.240 --> 33:30.332
Fore!

33:30.508 --> 33:33.170
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Yeah, that was a joke.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.542
You're such an asshole.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.843
I gotta program all my numbers
into this goddamn thing.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.419
Ha, ha. Come on, man,
my actions were justified.

33:43.588 --> 33:44.748
It was a pretty good hit.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.585
It was funny, I'll give
you that, but justified? Really?

33:47.759 --> 33:50.159
- Destroying my phone? Come on.
- No, maybe not.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.387
No, probably not. Not at all.

33:52.563 --> 33:55.031
No, but it's like her vagina
has you possessed.

33:55.433 --> 33:56.866
I like him. A lot.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.935
Okay, I know, I know,
but are you dating?

33:59.103 --> 34:02.334
- Are you in an exclusive relationship?
- I don't know.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.771
What do you mean?
Don't you think you should know?

34:04.943 --> 34:09.277
I mean, he could be out there dry humping
half of New York City right now.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.915
"Dry humping"? Oh, that's scandalous.
That worries me.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.074
Phil and I dry hump. Okay?

34:14.252 --> 34:16.243
And it is intense. And it's very erotic.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.685
And it's the only way
that I can actually get off.

34:18.856 --> 34:20.880
Dry humping is no fucking joke.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.927
So I think that you need to be clear
about what this relationship is.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.723
Now what is the story
with you guys?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.092
Are you doing it monogamous
or what's the deal?

34:29.266 --> 34:30.699
Yeah.

34:31.302 --> 34:32.768
I don't know. Uh...

34:32.937 --> 34:34.302
- Maybe, yeah.
- "Maybe"?

34:34.739 --> 34:37.264
Wow, okay.
You know what "maybe" gets you?

34:37.442 --> 34:40.934
It gets her sucking every dude's dick
out there at Stanford. It really does.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.545
Then you go and visit her.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.342
You have to kiss that blow-job factory
she calls a mouth.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.882
Thank you for that visual. Thanks, pal.

34:48.052 --> 34:51.487
That was, like, way graphic.
That was, like, extremely graphic.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.920
He's thousands of miles away from here.
You don't know what he's doing.

34:55.092 --> 35:00.053
He could be at some bar,
doing shots with some sexy bartender...

35:00.231 --> 35:01.289
...dry humping her.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.457
We haven't set the boundaries yet.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.760
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.370
We're not trying to choke each other
with commitment.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.096
But now you're freaking me out...

35:09.273 --> 35:13.004
...and I can't do anything but picture him
humping some bartender. Thank you.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.975
Terrify you.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.377
- I see Phil dry humping you.
- You don't wanna.

35:18.549 --> 35:22.246
I don't wanna think about
what that looks like. It's not pretty.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.648
Like, between the snorting
and the slobbering...

35:24.822 --> 35:26.380
...he's like a fucking shar-pei.

35:26.557 --> 35:27.819
Or what are those dogs with the:

35:29.293 --> 35:32.456
- Bulldogs?
- Yeah. Like a fucking bulldog.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.825
Does he look up at you
when he goes down on you?

35:34.999 --> 35:37.160
- Wanting approval?
- Yes. Ha, ha.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.030
"Am I doing it okay? Am I doing it?"

35:39.203 --> 35:41.330
- I hate that. Shut up and lick.
- It's horrible.

35:41.506 --> 35:42.905
I don't know, actually.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.599
Okay, look, look.
Can you see other people? All right?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.369
Can you hook up with other people?

35:47.545 --> 35:49.843
- Can you masturbate?
- Masturbate?

35:50.014 --> 35:51.845
Can you masturbate yourself off at all?

35:52.016 --> 35:54.280
- Why wouldn't I?
- Some girls frown upon that.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.683
- Some girls don't like you to masturbate.
- She's not like a puritan.

35:57.855 --> 36:02.383
Well, I'm just saying, like, some women
don't like people masturbating.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.619
Because I can hear you
through the walls.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.888
And you crack off a lot.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.361
"Crack it off"?

36:07.532 --> 36:08.556
Who says "crack off"?

36:08.733 --> 36:09.927
Why? What do you say?

36:10.101 --> 36:12.035
You may be thinking
of "snap one off"?

36:12.203 --> 36:14.865
- "Snap it off"?
- Or "pop"? Like, "pop one off"?

36:15.039 --> 36:17.837
I don't want anything to snap and pop
when I'm masturbating.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.909
- Lf it cracks a little bit, fine.
- "Fine"?

36:20.078 --> 36:23.570
The point is, you're gonna chafe yourself
cracking off as much as you do.

36:23.748 --> 36:26.273
All right, so, we...
Do you need help across the street?

36:26.451 --> 36:27.748
Okay. Don't pull, though.

36:27.919 --> 36:31.252
He goes crazy.
He's furious with his penis or something.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.480
Angry.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.488
Angry masturbation,
which is dangerous.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.422
- You can really injure yourself.
- Yeah.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.186
So he doesn't really know that.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.853
Yeah. I have to tell my grandson that.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.728
Tell your grandson.
Tell your grandson's friends, you know?

36:43.901 --> 36:45.232
Well, just him. Not others.

36:45.403 --> 36:49.203
You're right. Just him.
It might get awkward telling all his friends.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.240
<i>I guess you have to define it</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

36:53.644 --> 36:57.205
<i>So I guess we're saying...</i>

36:58.149 --> 37:00.174
...we're exclusive?

37:00.351 --> 37:03.047
- Yeah.
- Great.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.711
- I'm happy.
- Me too.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.416
Secretly, this is what I was aiming for.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.925
Well, not-so-secretly, me too.

37:11.095 --> 37:12.119
Keep it light.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.389
Light. Disease-free and light.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.624
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Bye.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.427
Goodbye.

37:21.506 --> 37:26.102
Can I please get the garbage omelet,
double meat, home fries...

37:26.277 --> 37:28.108
...and how about everything bagel...

37:28.279 --> 37:31.248
...with butter, cream cheese,
jelly, all that shit.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.849
And then, you know what?
I'll take a chocolate shake.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.747
And I will make it very easy for you.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.411
- You know, I'll have that same exact thing.
- Okay.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.523
Okay.

37:40.691 --> 37:45.594
Is there a way to just wrap it in lettuce,
like use lettuce for the bun?

37:45.763 --> 37:47.731
- Can do no bun. Does that work?
- No bun.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.059
Fries or salad?

37:49.233 --> 37:52.760
Uh, I'll get the salad
with dressing on the side.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.996
- Yep, coming up.
- Thank you.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.572
- Wow.
- What?

37:57.742 --> 38:00.233
- You're eating like a bird there, huh?
- No.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.812
He's visiting Erin for Thanksgiving
and worrying about his weight.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.005
- All right.
- Jesus.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.980
I told you not to say anything.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.845
We haven't seen each other
in a while, okay?

38:10.021 --> 38:11.989
Okay, I understand.
That makes sense to me.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.147
- Wanna tighten up.
- I get you, I get you.

38:14.325 --> 38:17.954
If you're so worried about your appearance,
are you gonna do something...

38:18.129 --> 38:19.596
...about your veiny, white skin?
- Mm.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.164
Right now you look like an actor
in a kabuki troupe.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.460
- You're one to talk about appearances.
- How so?

38:24.635 --> 38:26.830
No offense, but with the moustache...

38:27.004 --> 38:29.370
- What? You don't like it?
- It's disgusting.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.804
I don't care what you think.
This is not for you.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.500
Who's it for, the '83 Yankees bullpen?

38:34.879 --> 38:36.210
- Now, there we are.
- Very funny.

38:36.380 --> 38:40.373
No, I'm actually trying to scratch a very
specific demographic off of my fuck-it list.

38:40.551 --> 38:43.543
- What's a fuck-it list?
- He's got this list like a bucket list...

38:43.721 --> 38:46.315
...but it's women he's trying to bang
before he dies.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.958
So, what kind of women
are you hoping to attract?

38:49.126 --> 38:51.720
- Older women, between 45 and 60.
- Oh, so, cougars.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.194
- This is where it's weird.
- No. No, not cougars.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.198
Okay, see, cougars, to me,
are sad, desperate older women...

38:57.368 --> 38:58.892
...that want to be young now.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.528
Okay? But what I'm looking for are older
attractive women...

39:02.707 --> 39:05.198
...that want to be young again.
All right?

39:05.376 --> 39:08.539
See, when women see me
with a moustache of that type...

39:08.713 --> 39:11.273
...they're transported back
when the moustache was king:

39:11.449 --> 39:12.973
- The '70s, the early '80s.
- Right.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.345
All right?
The era of their sexual awakening.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.511
So then, when I'm on top of them,
and they look up at me...

39:18.689 --> 39:21.385
...they see this person,
they're transported to that time.

39:21.559 --> 39:24.426
All right? See, this isn't a moustache,
it's a time machine.

39:24.595 --> 39:27.223
It's a time machine
to the back of Burt Reynolds' Camaro.

39:27.632 --> 39:28.997
Right. You know what, it's...

39:29.166 --> 39:31.361
Bottom line is don't get a moustache,
get a tan.

39:31.535 --> 39:35.027
I don't think she's that kind of girl.
I don't think she's that superficial.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.572
Okay, so she won't bang fat dudes...

39:37.742 --> 39:41.303
...but she will sleep with a guy
that looks like his face is covered in jizz?

39:41.479 --> 39:43.447
If she's gonna
dump you for eating carbs...

39:43.614 --> 39:46.674
...she'll dump you for not having a tan.
- That's true.

39:47.485 --> 39:48.747
All right, I get the point.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.651
Once you're in the machine,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.691
You're gonna wanna put this on
your hands, under your nails...

39:56.861 --> 39:58.624
...unless you want your hands stained.

39:58.796 --> 40:00.923
- Right this way.
- Okay.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.863
- Enjoy the Faux de Soleil.
- Just a quick question. Uh...

40:34.332 --> 40:38.564
<i>Hello. Tanning will begin in five...</i>

40:38.869 --> 40:41.463
- Uh...
<i>...four, three...</i>

40:41.639 --> 40:43.698
- Should I be wearing underwear?
<i>...two, one.</i>

40:43.874 --> 40:47.002
Excuse me. Oh, God. Oh, goddamn it.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.338
Oh, and it stings.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.843
Fuck. Fuck, my eyes sting.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.504
What is this? Excuse me.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.445
Should I be wearing goggles?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.585
It stings. Is this bad?

40:56.153 --> 40:59.145
Ah. Tastes gross. Pff, pff.

40:59.323 --> 41:01.416
Tastes like poison. Pff, pff.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.924
Should l...? Is it bad if I eat it?

41:11.369 --> 41:13.428
Erin, you just got sat another table.

41:13.604 --> 41:16.266
No way. I closed out my section.
You know it, dude.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.773
Well, you were requested. So...

41:20.144 --> 41:21.168
Sorry, Mama.

41:24.415 --> 41:27.111
Goddamn it.

41:29.553 --> 41:32.044
I'm not gonna order anything,
I want you to know.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.485
But I got a tip for you.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.523
Is it the tip of your penis?

41:37.395 --> 41:41.024
- No, gross. Yes, it is.
- Aah!

41:41.499 --> 41:42.557
Oh, my God.

41:44.201 --> 41:48.035
- Twenty percent of my dick.
- Ha-ha-ha!

41:58.883 --> 42:00.680
Oh, God, yes. Come on.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.376
- Where's the bedroom?
- Too far.

42:03.554 --> 42:05.283
Come over here.

42:07.057 --> 42:08.922
Oh, God. Oh, I missed you.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.018
Come here. God!

42:11.195 --> 42:13.129
Oh, God. Oh, God!

42:16.901 --> 42:18.061
Oh!

42:23.941 --> 42:25.499
Phil!

42:26.143 --> 42:28.338
They came in so fast,
I didn't know where to go.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.074
Hi. I'm Phil.

42:31.248 --> 42:32.613
Hey. I'm Garrett.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.444
Good to meet you.

42:34.618 --> 42:37.280
- Why are you introducing yourself?
- I don't wanna be rude.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.922
Get up. Fucking get up.

42:39.089 --> 42:40.386
Is she still here?

42:40.558 --> 42:43.118
I'll tell you later.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.819
- Don't engage.
- I'm eating at a dinner table.

42:45.996 --> 42:49.523
- They're the ones fucking.
- Get fucking fuck upstairs.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.261
You guys are all set up, so I'll just...

42:52.736 --> 42:55.330
Make yourself at home.

43:10.621 --> 43:11.815
Aw...

43:11.989 --> 43:16.119
Mm. Corinne,
these mashed potatoes are amazing.

43:16.293 --> 43:18.488
Thank you.
I spent all day cleaning the table.

43:18.963 --> 43:20.430
- Sorry?
- Making them.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.066
I spent...
It's an old recipe from the family.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.263
Ahem. Well, very good.

43:27.505 --> 43:29.837
- Um, Garrett.
- Yes, Karen.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.999
Now, are you a singer or a musician?

43:33.177 --> 43:35.441
No. Neither one. Excuse me.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.911
Yeah, I'm just behind-the-scenes guy.

43:38.182 --> 43:43.347
He actually goes out and scouts
bands, and then he signs them to his label...

43:44.455 --> 43:47.015
...and he takes us
to, like, these amazing places.

43:47.191 --> 43:50.319
These seedy hole-in-the-walls
that you'd never know existed.

43:50.494 --> 43:52.428
It's not that cool.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.496
It is cool.

43:54.665 --> 43:55.893
She's being sweet.

43:56.066 --> 43:58.694
Believe me, it's a lot more interesting
than what Ron does.

43:58.869 --> 44:01.133
- Oh.
- He makes boxes for a living.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.797
Cardboard containers, Karen. Please.
They're cardboard... I'm a supervisor.

44:04.975 --> 44:08.001
- Pretty much boxes. Pretty much boxes.
- They're cardboard containers.

44:08.312 --> 44:11.611
Oh. I often use boxes.

44:13.217 --> 44:16.311
The thing about my job
is that it's in a state of flux.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.887
In fact, both of our fields
are kind of a little...

44:19.056 --> 44:21.183
- We're in very similar positions.
- Yeah.

44:21.358 --> 44:23.223
But we do it because we love it.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.861
We do it because we love it.

44:25.029 --> 44:28.123
So, Erin, did you know
he was coming in?

44:28.299 --> 44:30.164
No. He completely surprised me.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.358
Surprised me too.

44:32.870 --> 44:35.532
And it was quite a surprise.

44:35.706 --> 44:39.301
But he surprised me at work
with flowers.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.238
- Oh.
- Jesus Christ.

44:43.414 --> 44:45.507
It wasn't a big deal.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.675
I didn't, like, rappel in from
some helicopter. I just showed up.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.911
How come you never do that?
Ha, ha.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.578
Because we live together, Karen.

44:52.756 --> 44:55.520
I know, but it's nice
to show a gesture of appreciation.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.923
How long have you guys been together?

44:58.095 --> 45:00.563
- It's been a long time now. Yeah.
- Long time.

45:00.731 --> 45:04.064
It's kind of like when you get really drunk
and you just black out...

45:04.234 --> 45:06.930
...you don't know how much time's
gone by. Sort of a similar feeling.

45:09.273 --> 45:10.501
Oh.

45:10.674 --> 45:14.440
Erin, Karen, would you come help me
in the kitchen with dessert?

45:14.612 --> 45:18.309
Absolutely. Corinne's gonna go assassinate
your character. I gotta play defense.

45:18.482 --> 45:21.315
Yeah.

45:22.286 --> 45:23.981
Um...

45:24.421 --> 45:29.290
So, Ron, do you make all different sizes
of boxes, or do you specialize in a certain...?

45:29.460 --> 45:33.191
Do you have any idea of the trouble
that you're causing us there, chief?

45:35.399 --> 45:37.560
Ron, please,
tell me what's bothering you.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.930
I'll tell you what's bothering me there,
bucko.

45:40.104 --> 45:42.971
You just caused a prime-time problem
between me and my wife.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.576
Now I gotta go home and listen to her
complain that I don't do enough for her.

45:46.744 --> 45:50.703
Ha, ha. You think some effing sappy shit
makes you a real boyfriend?

45:50.881 --> 45:52.644
I stopped listening after "bucko."

45:52.816 --> 45:56.582
Listen up. We're in the effing trenches here,
where the real hell happens.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.688
All right? And we're here every day.

45:58.856 --> 46:01.916
It's not about flowers and presents
and showing up for the weekend.

46:02.092 --> 46:06.825
Do you think you can just come in here
with your fake tan and your girl shirt?

46:06.997 --> 46:08.021
What?

46:08.198 --> 46:10.598
You think that's what it's like
when you're married?

46:10.768 --> 46:15.034
When you're in a serious,
long-term relationship?

46:15.239 --> 46:18.902
You think you're gonna be able to work out
and keep that nice ass of yours?

46:19.209 --> 46:21.074
No. You're not gonna be able to keep it.

46:25.516 --> 46:28.417
<i>And I don't wanna say</i>

46:29.920 --> 46:32.286
<i>If it goes away</i>

46:32.856 --> 46:33.880
Hey.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.958
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

46:36.126 --> 46:38.390
Hey, do you remember my friend Harper
from work?

46:38.595 --> 46:41.291
Yeah, we've met. How are you?
It's good to see you again.

46:54.511 --> 46:57.742
<i>What the rest did</i>
<i>I was average</i>

46:57.915 --> 47:00.543
<i>But I don't mind</i>

47:01.785 --> 47:05.221
<i>Drawn on two sides</i>
<i>Without disguise</i>

47:05.389 --> 47:08.119
<i>But I don't mind</i>

47:08.292 --> 47:11.056
<i>And I, I spit fire</i>

47:11.228 --> 47:13.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.956
- I love them. Yeah.
- Yeah? They're so good.

47:16.133 --> 47:18.829
<i>You don't believe me</i>

47:19.002 --> 47:21.994
They spent three years and all their money
getting this produced.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.230
Really?

47:23.407 --> 47:25.398
These are the bands
that should get noticed.

47:25.576 --> 47:30.275
I hate that. I hate that a band like this
would get passed over because of money.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.312
It's just take a chance on someone
because they deserve it...

47:33.484 --> 47:35.315
...because they're genuinely talented.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.080
Sorry. I'm sorry.

47:37.254 --> 47:40.781
It's just frustrating because I know
at my label they'd never go for this.

47:40.958 --> 47:43.153
It would be like a waste of time
to bring it up.

47:43.327 --> 47:46.524
Well, if you act all melodramatic
like that, yeah, it would be.

47:46.697 --> 47:50.155
But if you showed your balls and you
went in there and got in their face...

47:50.334 --> 47:53.303
...and said "listen to this,"
the worst they could do is say no.

47:53.470 --> 47:55.700
Or get mad at you
because you showed your balls.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.569
- There you are.
- Damon.

47:59.243 --> 48:00.676
Hi. How are you?

48:00.844 --> 48:02.812
- I'm all right. How are you?
- I'm great.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.242
What's going on?

48:04.414 --> 48:05.574
- Hey. Garrett.
- I'm Damon.

48:05.749 --> 48:07.410
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

48:07.584 --> 48:10.747
- We all work together. He is the bartender.
- Oh, wow.

48:11.288 --> 48:12.312
Cheers.

48:12.489 --> 48:16.186
- Where have you been, Damon?
- Um, I was just helping my mom move.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.349
Aw...

48:17.528 --> 48:19.086
No, she's just getting old...

48:19.263 --> 48:22.096
...and I want her to live closer to me,
you know?

48:22.266 --> 48:23.290
Aw...

48:23.467 --> 48:24.456
Gush.

48:24.635 --> 48:27.866
It's funny, because I actually want my
mother to move further away from me.

48:30.174 --> 48:32.404
Good, good, good.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.602
- Well, you know, it's my mom, you know?
- So cute.

48:35.779 --> 48:37.508
- "And then my mom."
- My mom.

48:37.681 --> 48:40.172
- Mothers are important.
- Yeah, they are.

48:40.350 --> 48:42.614
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for her vagina.

48:42.786 --> 48:44.151
<i>Found it easy</i>

48:44.321 --> 48:50.692
<i>Easy</i>

48:57.634 --> 48:59.761
Ooh. Shh.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.427
- What?
- Sorry. Sorry.

49:01.605 --> 49:05.063
- Maya. Oh.
- Okay.

49:05.509 --> 49:06.635
Hells yeah.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.546
- Icing and vodka.
- Mm.

49:09.713 --> 49:12.841
- That's a great chaser. Mm.
- Mm. Taste it.

49:15.752 --> 49:18.277
So Damon seems like a good guy.

49:18.455 --> 49:20.252
Oh, my God. He's amazing.

49:20.424 --> 49:23.359
- Like my rock.
- Your rock?

49:23.527 --> 49:25.620
Yeah, I wouldn't get through work
without him.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.822
Wow. And he's handsome,
and he loves his mother, and...

49:30.601 --> 49:33.536
- Are you jealous?
- Aw, come on. Come on.

49:34.037 --> 49:35.732
No. Mm-mm.

49:35.906 --> 49:37.032
Yes, you are.

49:37.407 --> 49:41.343
I'm just a little curious if you guys
have ever, you know...

49:41.511 --> 49:43.479
You know. Sorry.

49:45.749 --> 49:48.377
No. No. Not at all.

49:49.186 --> 49:50.949
Oh, my God.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.816
You always gotta close your eyes.

50:04.301 --> 50:06.326
- Hey, Corinne.
- Hey.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.903
I'm taking off.

50:09.539 --> 50:13.236
Um, can I help you? I don't know
what happened. It was something...

50:13.410 --> 50:14.707
- No! No! No.
- Oh, God.

50:14.878 --> 50:17.005
- Sorry. No. No thank you. I'm good.
- Okay.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.579
- I'm good.
- I'm so sorry.

50:20.183 --> 50:24.984
Our introduction was not how I imagined
it would be, obviously...

50:27.424 --> 50:28.516
...but that was my hand.

50:29.960 --> 50:34.488
The handprint on my, uh, buttocks...

50:36.199 --> 50:38.565
...and my genitalia.

50:39.636 --> 50:41.627
You have a handprint on your crotch too?

50:43.874 --> 50:45.842
- You ready?
- Yes. Great.

50:47.744 --> 50:50.406
- Okay. Well, see you later, Corinne.
- I'll be back soon.

50:50.580 --> 50:52.639
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

50:52.816 --> 50:54.113
- Have a safe...
- What?

50:54.284 --> 50:56.946
- Have a safe flight, Garrett.
- Thank you. You too...

50:57.120 --> 50:58.985
Or not... You're not flying. Okay.

51:04.795 --> 51:07.855
Oh, yes. Middle seat. Awesome.

51:08.031 --> 51:10.625
And a layover. Be fun.

51:10.968 --> 51:13.368
Thank you for making this trip.

51:13.537 --> 51:15.300
Thank you. That was the best.

51:15.472 --> 51:16.564
I had fun.

51:16.740 --> 51:19.732
I had fun too. Despite everything.

51:20.377 --> 51:22.675
Please, please apologize
to her again for me.

51:22.846 --> 51:24.177
- I will.
- Okay.

51:24.381 --> 51:27.282
- God, she hates me. She does.
- Yeah.

51:31.521 --> 51:33.250
I love you.

51:34.324 --> 51:36.258
I love you too.

51:47.571 --> 51:49.436
I miss you already.

52:06.957 --> 52:09.448
Cruella de Vil
was not based on an actual person.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.117
I'm pretty sure she was.
A German lady.

52:12.362 --> 52:14.353
I think you're wrong about that.
Hey, Dan.

52:14.531 --> 52:15.896
Welcome home, buddy boy.

52:16.066 --> 52:18.364
Dude, what the fuck is this?

52:18.535 --> 52:21.698
- We got an open-door policy. It's cool.
- Why? Why do you have that?

52:21.872 --> 52:24.534
Well, we don't. He does.
I just kind of accept it.

52:24.708 --> 52:26.699
- How was the trip, bro?
- It was awesome.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.873
- Do we have beers?
- We do have beers.

52:29.046 --> 52:30.377
- Will you grab me one?
- Great.

52:30.547 --> 52:32.208
Don't drink a beer on the toilet.

52:32.382 --> 52:33.906
I was worried you'd get dumped...

52:34.084 --> 52:36.575
...and we'd have to go to the bar.
It went well, huh?

52:36.753 --> 52:38.186
No. It was really good.

52:38.355 --> 52:39.982
- All the way.
- That's all I'm doing.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.216
That's as far as I'm going.

52:42.392 --> 52:44.223
- I can't reach.
- That's as far as I go.

52:44.394 --> 52:46.862
I am not gonna hand you a beer
while you're shitting.

52:47.030 --> 52:49.021
- I don't wanna get up.
- Get it afterwards.

52:49.199 --> 52:52.225
I'm pooping as we speak.
I don't wanna have to get up to get a...

52:52.402 --> 52:53.926
Take it. There. Take it.

52:54.104 --> 52:55.696
- Thank you!
- Enjoy it. All right?

52:55.872 --> 52:58.397
- I'm gonna go.
- It's fine. It's closed now.

52:59.676 --> 53:01.166
Did you tell her you loved her?

53:03.380 --> 53:05.007
- I might have.
- Did you really?

53:05.182 --> 53:06.706
Yeah. I did.

53:06.883 --> 53:08.680
Are you serious?

53:08.852 --> 53:09.841
Wow.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.817
- You gotta be careful.
- No.

53:11.988 --> 53:14.752
- You gotta be careful.
- Don't tell him he has to be careful.

53:14.925 --> 53:17.723
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.

53:17.894 --> 53:19.156
That's a very long time.

53:19.329 --> 53:20.353
- Stop.
- Will you...?

53:20.530 --> 53:24.057
Okay. Four months, all right? So now,
in this four months, how much time...

53:24.234 --> 53:27.761
...do you think you've spent together,
like in the same city? Physically.

53:27.938 --> 53:29.872
- Uh, I don't know.
- Forty days?

53:30.540 --> 53:32.098
- Yeah. Forty days.
- Tops. Yeah?

53:32.275 --> 53:33.765
Sure, that sounds about right.

53:33.944 --> 53:37.641
Now look, I have done the long-distance
thing, and it is hard as hell.

53:37.814 --> 53:40.248
And it doesn't matter how good
the relationship is.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.885
It literally can just rip it apart.

53:43.220 --> 53:47.247
Look, it is just very hard to be away from
the person you love for months at a time.

53:47.424 --> 53:49.790
I know. I know it's not gonna be easy.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.052
That's all I'm saying.

53:54.030 --> 53:56.055
But maybe you never found
the right girl.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.197
That's not a bad point.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.731
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

54:02.906 --> 54:05.932
You know what?
I want some privacy now. Pardon me.

54:06.543 --> 54:07.874
<i>It's Erin, leave a message.</i>

54:10.013 --> 54:12.743
Well, now I miss you even more.

54:12.916 --> 54:14.508
Thanks a lot.

54:18.488 --> 54:22.549
I'm going to bed,
so call me in the morning.

54:23.293 --> 54:25.284
Okay, good night.

55:10.807 --> 55:13.367
It's barely gonna fit.
The other ones wouldn't have fit.

55:13.543 --> 55:15.534
But you saw the top off
the bigger one and...

55:15.712 --> 55:18.112
What's the point?
Why not get one that's gonna fit?

55:18.281 --> 55:21.182
This one looks little.
People are gonna think we're gay.

55:21.351 --> 55:23.512
Okay, let's open our presents
at the same time.

55:23.687 --> 55:26.747
It's exciting and sad,
since it's the only present I got this year.

55:26.923 --> 55:27.947
Okay.

55:28.124 --> 55:30.524
<i>You did a good wrapping job too.</i>
<i>I hope it's a pony.</i>

55:31.895 --> 55:34.955
<i>Oh... Centipede.</i>

55:35.131 --> 55:36.155
I love it!

55:39.502 --> 55:41.060
<i>That's so awesome.</i>

55:41.238 --> 55:43.206
I love my present.

55:43.373 --> 55:44.635
I love you.

55:52.449 --> 55:54.280
Hyah!

55:56.586 --> 55:58.554
Hyah!

56:01.524 --> 56:02.786
Hey, Corinne.

56:02.959 --> 56:06.087
Can you ask Maya to keep it down
for just a second?

56:06.263 --> 56:08.163
Maya, statue.

56:22.679 --> 56:23.873
<i>Hello.</i>

56:24.047 --> 56:26.413
Hi, um, Hugh Edwards, please.

56:26.783 --> 56:30.378
- This is he.
- Uh, hi. Uh, this is Erin Langford.

56:31.021 --> 56:34.354
- No.
- I was a summer intern for you.

56:34.658 --> 56:35.750
No.

56:35.925 --> 56:41.261
I wrote that piece that you liked
so much on Grant-A-Dream.

56:41.431 --> 56:44.059
- Oh, yeah. How are you?
<i>- I'm good.</i>

56:44.234 --> 56:45.599
Um...

56:45.769 --> 56:49.068
You told me
that I should call you in January...

56:49.239 --> 56:52.970
...about a possible permanent position,
so...

56:53.143 --> 56:54.940
...here I am, calling you.

56:55.111 --> 56:56.135
<i>Oh, right.</i>

56:57.147 --> 57:02.210
Well, look, honestly, we just got done
laying off 100 people...

57:02.385 --> 57:05.479
...so we're not gonna be hiring
any time soon.

57:06.022 --> 57:07.421
<i>Sorry.</i>

57:08.658 --> 57:11.752
<i>Why don't you try blogging? You know?</i>
<i>Heh.</i>

57:12.562 --> 57:15.030
<i>Look, uh, best of luck to you.</i>

57:15.498 --> 57:17.625
- Okay.
<i>- Take care.</i>

57:17.801 --> 57:18.790
Thank you.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.504
Fuck! Fuck.

57:26.676 --> 57:28.610
<i>I wanted that job, okay?</i>

57:28.778 --> 57:30.575
I wanted to be in New York.

57:30.747 --> 57:33.944
Look at it this way, it's not like
someone else got the job over you.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.675
They're just not taking anyone.

57:35.852 --> 57:39.015
Yeah, I get it.
It's a bad time for newspapers, okay?

57:39.189 --> 57:43.285
It's not just about the fucking job.
I wanted to be in the same city as you.

57:43.827 --> 57:45.920
I know. Believe me, I know.

57:46.096 --> 57:50.658
But there are other papers in New York,
right? So that's still a possibility.

57:50.834 --> 57:51.994
<i>I seriously doubt...</i>

57:52.168 --> 57:57.037
...that if a paper like <i>The Sentinel</i> just cut
100 jobs that anybody's hiring right now.

57:57.207 --> 58:00.176
Yeah, but listen,
you don't know that until you try.

58:00.343 --> 58:04.507
<i>You're angry and you're frustrated</i>
<i>and I get it and I wish I could hug you.</i>

58:04.681 --> 58:05.705
I know, I know.

58:05.882 --> 58:08.976
That's the whole fucking problem
is you're there and I'm here...

58:09.152 --> 58:13.646
...and I'm in this fucking kitchen right now,
and it fucking stinks.

58:13.823 --> 58:17.725
Relax now, and try to get some sleep and
we'll make a new plan tomorrow. I promise.

58:17.894 --> 58:19.361
Um, I gotta go, okay?

58:19.529 --> 58:21.190
<i>- Bye.</i>
- I lov...

58:26.436 --> 58:30.896
- Wanna do some more of that later?
- Yeah. Please.

58:34.911 --> 58:37.812
Long-distance fucking sucks.

58:39.616 --> 58:42.312
Yep. Look, I told you it was rough.

58:42.485 --> 58:44.248
I know. It's so rough.

58:44.421 --> 58:47.982
And even worse, I'm so horny.

58:49.325 --> 58:52.055
There's definitely someone here
who can help you with that.

58:52.829 --> 58:54.922
- Don't tempt me.
- I'm just saying.

58:55.098 --> 58:57.760
What am I gonna do for a fucking job?

58:57.934 --> 59:01.301
Okay? What am I gonna do with my life?

59:01.571 --> 59:03.368
I don't want to be a waitress forever.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.500
No, seriously, listen to me.

59:05.942 --> 59:09.070
I want to be a reporter.
I want to tell stories.

59:09.245 --> 59:11.338
What, like on the newspaper?

59:11.514 --> 59:14.210
See, you understand. Fuck.

59:15.785 --> 59:17.082
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

59:17.253 --> 59:18.777
There we go.

59:20.890 --> 59:22.187
Jesus Christ.

59:22.358 --> 59:25.225
- Ha-ha-ha. Sorry.
- What the fuck is your problem?

59:25.395 --> 59:29.388
Let me tell you, steroid-face. I'd think
you were comfortable with needles.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.931
Watch yourself, sweetheart.

59:31.100 --> 59:33.193
Speaking of sweethearts,
you can suck my dick.

59:33.369 --> 59:35.599
- She doesn't have a dick.
- I actually do.

59:35.772 --> 59:36.796
No, she doesn't.

59:36.973 --> 59:38.941
And you should put your mouth
on my penis.

59:39.108 --> 59:41.076
Get her out of here
before I kick your ass.

59:41.244 --> 59:42.802
My friend is gonna kick your ass.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.571
- Oh, is that right?
- No.

59:44.747 --> 59:47.944
By the way, steroids have side effects.

59:48.117 --> 59:52.247
They may include a small dick,
worshipping of Michael Bay...

59:52.422 --> 59:54.447
- You out of your mind?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:54.624 --> 59:58.424
We could all sit around and watch
<i>Transformers</i> together, jack off to it.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.587
- Bye.
- Suck my dick, bitch.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.231
Seriously.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.889
Suck it!

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:06.262
Stupid fuck.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:09.098
- Let's get in there! We can take him!
- Come on, let's go!

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.864
Son of a bitch.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.840
I need to get home.

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:26.121
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.248
I'm fine.

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:54.115
Hi.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.710
Honey, I'm just gonna tell you right now,
Maya drew on your face.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.662
Shit.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.802
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.710
Oh, my God.
I must've left you seven messages.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.873
Please, please, God, tell me you're okay.

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.818
Yeah, I'm fine. I just... Unh.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:35.617
I was out late last night with Damon.
I got real drunk.

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:36.984
Damon? Yeah?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He was just listening to me vent, you know.

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:43.432
- Wow. Okay.
- What's wrong?

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:48.068
- Nothing.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:49.830
Nothing happened, okay?

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:53.141
- Huh.
- You have nothing to worry about.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.107
<i>Please just tell me that you trust me.</i>

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:57.678
3Z's in the conference room already.
Get in there.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.576
Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.182
I gotta go. Can't talk.

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.046
Oh, shit.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:12.856
Langford.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.326
- Yes?
- Any luck?

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.796
Uh, no. Thank you for asking. Um...

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.602
I've checked every newspaper
and magazine in New York...

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.500
...and all dead ends.

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.005
Well, the <i>Chronicle</i> has an opening,
miraculously...

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.111
...so I recommended you
and a few other students.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.677
Thank you. Um...

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:35.579
I just... I sort of had my heart
set on New York.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:40.155
Well, it's kind of brutal out there.
You're not really in a position to be picky.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:42.751
Okay.

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.284
Thank you.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:48.360
<i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> may I help you?

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.797
<i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> please hold.

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:01.538
- You can go in now.
- Thank you.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:08.910
I'm looking for any job opportunities in
the San Francisco area, so if you know...

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:12.544
Totally, I get it.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.747
Yeah. You know, I tried them, but...

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:17.222
Thank you, though. Okay, thank you.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.692
Why don't you try blowing me next time?

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:21.387
Um...

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.088
- Okay.
- Not you.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.700
Sorry, I'm dealing with some shit.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.393
I'm sorry. Bad timing.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.903
- It's okay. It's good to know.
- Oh. Fucking Evites.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:34.009
It's for a month from now.
Who does that? Oh.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:36.611
It's mine. It's for my birthday.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.242
Shit.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:45.684
Mark's coming in from Florida
and I really want him to meet everyone...

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:48.016
...so I kind of gotta plan ahead.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.087
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.455
It's fine.

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:55.154
This is not an excuse,
but I'm so tired and frustrated.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:58.129
I haven't seen my girlfriend in a while.
I'm losing my mind.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.565
I'm in a long-distance relationship too,
I get it.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.399
- It fucking sucks.
- Really does.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.700
Tell me you have some suggestions.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.277
Phone sex.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:10.875
And, um, lots of it.

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.479
What are you wearing?

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:20.915
Uh...

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:26.426
Red lace panties and a bra and a garter.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.962
Holy shit, you really went all out.

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:32.000
No, you fucking idiot, it's a fantasy.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.733
- Oh, right.
- What are you wearing?

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.269
Um...

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.129
What do you think is sexy?

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.609
White boxer briefs.

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:42.836
Really? Like Marky Mark?

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:45.810
Oh, God, especially like Marky Mark.

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.643
<i>If you even say "Marky Mark"...</i>

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.685
...I'm gonna fucking come right now.
- Shit. Baby, please take this seriously.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:54.323
Please. I'm so horny I can't even think.

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.722
<i>- All right, sorry.</i>
- Okay, um...

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:03.330
<i>Okay, so tell me about something</i>
<i>that you're touching or whatever.</i>

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.161
I'm touching myself.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.997
Yeah, okay, good. Where?
Where are you touching yourself?

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:11.971
<i>Everywhere. Absolutely everywhere,</i>
<i>all over, up and down.</i>

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.837
- Up and down?
<i>- Especially in the wet parts.</i>

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.444
Oh, God, yeah, that's good.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:20.549
- I want to make good on that. Hold on.
<i>- Erin? Erin.</i>

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.279
Hello? I lost you.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.614
<i>- Did I lose you?</i>
- Hello? Okay.

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.278
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I'm there.

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:30.290
- Okay, all right.
- Oh, God, I wanna fuck you so bad.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.984
I wanna fuck you so hard.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:35.024
I wanna come all over you.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:38.133
No, I want you to come on the towel
beside your pillow.

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.963
- Yeah, okay.
- I love fucking you so much.

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:43.605
You know what I fucking love doing?
I love riding you!

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:44.967
Oh, yeah.

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:47.541
- Wait, wait, wait.
- God, I love fucking riding you!

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.611
- But I'm on top. Baby, I'm on top.
- No, I'm on top.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.715
- I'm on top. How can you be on top?
- Because we're in your car.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:54.975
No, we're on a plane.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.346
Didn't I tell you that we're in your car?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.149
You said the towel next to my pillow.
Why would there be a pillow in the car?

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.417
Why would there be a towel
on the plane?

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:05.754
They give out those hand towels
in first class.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:09.262
Well, we wouldn't be in first class,
we'd be in coach.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.593
- Fine, we're in coach.
- What's everybody doing?

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:13.235
Are they watching us fucking?

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.530
We're in a bathroom.
We'll go in the bathroom.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.230
I don't wanna get that blue toilet shit
all over me.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.501
I'm not gonna put you in the toilet.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.542
<i>- Put the lid down...</i>
- Gonna get arrested.

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:26.845
We're not gonna get arrested. We'll lock
the door. It's a fantasy! There's no...

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:30.679
Oh, Christ, you know what?
We'll go in the car. We'll go in the car.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.549
Oh, fuck the car.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.253
You know what?
I think the moment's passed.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:38.689
This isn't really working.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:40.794
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- It's okay.

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.933
You know, I thought "blue balls"
was just a saying...

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.762
...but I'm getting a lot
of veinage here.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.063
I'm actually kind of concerned.

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.296
Oh, God.

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.238
That's okay.

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:57.140
I'll just tighten the vise grip
on my dick one more notch.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.046
- All right. You do that.
<i>- All right.</i>

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.649
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye.

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.376
Bye.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:07.749
Fuck!

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:11.052
You know, Garrett, I like the airplane.
People do cars too much.

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.094
Dan, are you kidding?

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:37.810
Hello?

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:41.445
<i>Hello, Erin?</i>
<i>This is Sarah Conant at the</i> Chronicle.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:42.784
Hello.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:45.826
<i>Listen, we're all very impressed over here</i>
<i>by your work...</i>

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:49.761
<i>...and I would like to offer you the position</i>
<i>at our Metro desk.</i>

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.800
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:57.770
<i>So we'll need you to come in</i>
<i>on April 15th at 10 a. M...</i>

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.965
<i>...and you can meet with our editors.</i>

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:03.044
Okay. Thank you very much.

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.407
<i>You're welcome. Bye-bye.</i>

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:47.212
I'm sorry about not picking you up,
but I just really wanted to surprise you.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.255
With the romance and the candles
and whatnot.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.158
Hey, Erin.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.924
Hi, Dan.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.500
I missed you.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.193
I missed you too, Dan.

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.837
- I missed you so much.
- Dan.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.017
Wait.

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:21.453
Just wait, wait, baby.
Wait a second, okay?

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.362
Okay. Can I be done waiting now?

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.863
- Listen, okay?
- What?

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:33.433
I just... I need a second.
I wanna look at your face.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.867
And I've missed you.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:38.370
Oh, my God, I've missed you too.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.143
What is it? Something's wrong.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:47.615
I am really, really getting tired of us
spending so much time apart.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.752
I know. I know, but look,
we're here now, so...

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:52.519
Yeah.

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:53.813
And, um...

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:58.159
But there's a job.

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.488
What do you mean? What job?

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:04.690
Well, I interviewed
with the <i>San Francisco Chronicle...</i>

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.062
...and they offered me a job.

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:08.970
Wow.

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:11.003
That's great.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:13.836
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna take it?

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:16.805
I don't know.

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.972
Oh. Man.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.214
Wow.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.719
What?

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:29.420
- Nothing.
- No, not "nothing." What?

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:32.425
It's a little strange to me...

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.893
...because in one breath
you're telling me...

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.931
...that it's hard to be apart
and you're struggling with this.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.901
And then in the next you're saying we
might be apart for a really long time.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.438
No, I mean, I don't know yet, okay?

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:48.168
And my goal is to be here with you.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:53.304
But this is such a big opportunity for me
that we need to talk about it.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:57.919
Yeah, let's talk about this huge bomb
you just laid on me.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.749
Fuck, Erin, you didn't even tell me
you interviewed.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.289
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.927
Well, you did.
What do you mean, you didn't mean to?

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.223
It's something you either do or you don't.
You make a choice.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.127
You know, amazingly,
I'm not in the mood.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.526
Fuck.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:19.937
Erin, you know what?
Let's just go out. Let's just go out.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:24.302
I don't know, I'm feeling sexy tonight,
you know what I'm saying?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.247
I got a good feeling like I might be getting
laid by one of you ladies.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.715
Not it.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.510
Come on, Dan, just shoot pool.

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:35.589
All right, okay. I'm just trying
to talk about how sexy I feel.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.589
I'm gonna go get another drink.

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:50.064
<i>Well, if you need me</i>
<i>I'm right here</i>

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:53.504
<i>No matter what</i>
<i>I'm always near</i>

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.336
Garrett.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.003
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.375
What are you doing here?

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.016
Uh, Box invited me.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:03.545
Of course.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.013
- Do you wanna do a shot of Jäger?
- Yes.

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:08.418
Hey, Christopher. Two.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.616
This is so weird
to see you out of the off...

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.591
- You look great.
- Well, thanks.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.025
Ahh. Thank you.

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:20.066
Hey. Um, I was just looking for you
because I wanted to... Hello.

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:22.033
Um...

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:25.901
Sorry, this is Erin, my, um...

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.773
Girl... Girlfriend.

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:31.937
This is Brianna, who I work with.
My friend.

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.638
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:37.047
Garrett is always talking about you
and I hear your name all the time.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:39.517
It's really nice to put a face to it.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.123
Um...

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:45.957
So are you planning on moving out here
any time soon?

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.755
Ooh.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.160
- Hell of a question.
- I don't know.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.096
- L...
- She knows.

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:56.034
She got big news today that pertains
to that very question. Tell her.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.799
Tell her your big news.
Tell her your big news.

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:01.466
Big news that I just found out about.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.810
- No?
- It was nice to meet you.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.979
- Yeah.
- Um...

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:12.951
I'm gonna go sleep at Brandy's
because it's obvious that you have...

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:15.790
I'm... Yeah, bye.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.361
All right.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.028
- Here you go.
- Oh, good.

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:30.533
Well...

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.330
...cheers.

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:38.303
- Are you okay?
- Ha, ha. I am now.

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:39.675
Ha, ha.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:42.875
- You have a lot of jingle jangles.
- Yeah, she does.

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:44.314
Hi.

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:47.547
- Garrett, introductions.
- This is Dan. This is Brianna.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:48.883
- Hi.
- Daniel.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.989
- Oh.
- Daniel von...

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:52.518
...Jägermeister.

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:53.888
Hello, Daniel.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:56.759
I'm a very wealthy man.
Garrett, can you buy us some shots?

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.957
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Come on, let's get a drink.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.546
What the fuck?

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.312
Fuck! Fuck! I don't know,
I don't know what I was thinking!

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.749
I got so drunk last night.

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:21.913
I'm sorry. I drank so much.

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.719
Ha-ha-ha. Hey.

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:28.519
Knock, knock, in there.
How you doing, huh?

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:31.666
Hey, last night, awesome.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.734
Seriously, the best sex of my life, ever.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.994
You wanna go for round two?
Do it again?

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.504
- Dan, you threw up on me!
- I did throw up on you.

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.938
I threw up on you a little bit
and I apologized...

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.908
...and I thought we were past that.
I was hoping we were.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.411
You cried all night.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.913
Crying is a part of feeling, all right?

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.917
Come on. You want some breakfast?
I'll cook you up some eggs.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.681
- I have a boyfriend.
- That's not a problem for me.

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:55.016
Hey.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.715
Hey.

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:59.117
Hey.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.572
I should've just told you
about the interview, about everything.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.230
You know, no matter what.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.001
No.

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:18.371
You know, we'll figure it out.

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:21.277
We'll just figure it out.

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.884
I know that you keep saying
that we're gonna figure it out...

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:29.889
...but we haven't.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:31.816
But we will.

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:36.863
But we haven't and we need
to make a decision right away.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.097
Okay, well, uh...

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.299
Yeah, I know. Make a decision, then.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.999
Why is this all on me?

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:45.663
What are you talking about, "why you"?
Your decision.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.173
So it's all about whether
I move to New York?

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:50.141
What about you moving
to San Francisco?

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:53.577
You kidding? I've been calling music labels
there for the last month...

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.614
...every day, diligently.

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.911
I called a label that turned out
to be a kid...

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:01.318
...who's collecting demos from his friends.
He didn't want to hire me.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.989
There's nothing. There are no jobs.
Trust me, I called them all.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.494
I love that you're fine with me
moving to New York and waiting tables...

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:12.293
...but you wouldn't even think about
serving coffee in fucking San Francisco.

01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:15.096
- It's all about what's convenient for you.
- Wait.

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:16.761
And you hate your job.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:22.004
Fine, I'll just make the decision
for both of us.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.373
You can just totally leave it all on me.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.111
I got it.

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.283
<i>Look at me, oh, look at me</i>

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:44.592
<i>Is this the way I'll always be?</i>
<i>Oh, no, oh, no</i>

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.962
Jesus, Harper.
Maybe be a little more subtle?

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.900
I'm checking out their packages.
They want you to look.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.700
- Oh, that's gross.
- It's not gross, actually. Strangely.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.834
- Um, hello?
- <i>Hey, Erin. What are you doing?</i>

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.809
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I can't hear you.

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:01.176
- Where are you?
- Huh?

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:04.008
- Where are you?
- Oh!

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.644
I'm at, like, this sketchy club.
It's girls' night out.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:10.189
Oh, fun.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.656
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.990
<i>- Go outside.</i>
- Hold on.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:17.860
You guys save mine.
I gotta go outside and talk to Garrett.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.194
He's an asshole.
Tell him to move here already.

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.303
Hey, Garrett.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.871
- It's Harper. How you doing?
<i>- Hey, Harper.</i>

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.769
Look, Erin can't come to the phone...

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:30.139
...because she's gonna meet a guy
who lives here and respects her...

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:33.042
...and she's gonna make out with him
and have his baby.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.739
What?

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:37.818
I'm sorry.
You know, I shouldn't drink tequila.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.921
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:43.419
No, it's just... You know Harper,
she's out of her fucking mind.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:47.050
- Why was she saying all that stuff?
- Look, don't worry about it, okay?

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:49.493
I told her about the fight, you know?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.294
I had to, I'm sorry. I'm a fucking girl,
that's what we do. We talk it out.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:55.130
- Right.
- Do you get it?

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.329
Sure, I've seen <i>Moesha.</i>

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.269
Cool. Okay, what's going on with you?

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:04.378
Hey, listen. I know you're on a deadline
to make a decision about this <i>Chronicle</i> job.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:08.107
I know that, and you were right, by
the way. You should not be in this alone.

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:11.811
<i>I wanna help you</i>
<i>and we're in this together, right?</i>

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:16.418
<i>But that being said,</i>
<i>I gotta be honest with you.</i>

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.122
I want you in New York.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:22.094
But not just you in New York, I want you
and me in New York living together.

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.664
I wanna get a place with you,
a place that you love.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:26.460
<i>A place that we can make our own...</i>

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.229
...where we can put Tom Cruise
all over the walls...

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:33.842
...and get Tom Cruise bed sheets
and Tom Cruise toilet paper.

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.000
<i>Or we could buy our own Centipede</i>
<i>machine...</i>

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.442
<i>...and drink jugs of Sunshine Harbor</i>
<i>all day.</i>

01:18:38.614 --> 01:18:40.673
<i>I just want a real relationship with you...</i>

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:44.307
...because I love you
and you're my best friend.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.384
And frankly, I am so tired of missing you.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.649
And I know this is a lot to put on you.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:55.729
And I'm open to whatever...

01:18:56.198 --> 01:19:00.328
...but I really wanna come out and see you
and figure all of this out together.

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:02.966
I'd like that.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.940
Okay. Good.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.906
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.705
Bye.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:55.020
Maya Papaya.
Where's Erin? Is she here?

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.317
She's upstairs in the shower.

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:00.384
- Baby? Hey.
- Uh-huh?

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:03.394
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.157
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:08.526
- God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.729
- Listen...
- What?

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.100
I wanna move to New York.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.399
Are you serious?

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.141
Yes.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.877
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.850
So have you told the <i>Chronicle</i> yet?

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:29.289
No. I'm sort of waiting till Monday.

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:31.150
Okay.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.886
Phil wants to know if you guys
wanna watch <i>The Notebook.</i>

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.189
- Where you going?
- Going inside.

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:39.590
- Hey, Garrett.
- Hey. Do you need help?

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.702
- You can grab that for me.
- Okay.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.861
- Start putting them on.
- Great.

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.563
So...

01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:47.106
Must be excited, huh?

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:49.005
Yeah. Excited.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.645
It's wonderful.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:54.515
You know, Garrett,
how much I love my sister, right?

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:55.843
Of course.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.578
I mean, she means everything to me.

01:20:58.754 --> 01:21:01.746
And that, as you can see,
I'm very protective of her.

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:05.951
So it's been very hard for me watching her
struggle with this decision...

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.961
...to come with you
or to take this incredible job.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.457
But, you know...

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:12.895
...she loves you.

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.901
And, uh, I know how much you love her.

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:20.636
But you need to know how much
she's giving up to be with you.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.606
So don't break her heart.

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:24.268
Okay?

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.180
Or I'll cut your balls off.

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:31.351
- I'm not fucking kidding.
- Okay.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.218
- I'm kidding.
- Jesus Christ.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.380
- I'm kidding.
- Um...

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.116
Thanks.

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:45.130
Um...

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.699
- So should l...?
- Take those in.

01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:48.268
- Yep. Okay.
- Thanks.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:53.674
Fucker.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:59.445
Yeah, I wish I had lived in New York
at some point in my life.

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:00.639
Oh, yeah?

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:04.043
I feel like I could have really
shaken up that place.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:10.747
So, what are your plans for work?

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:14.554
Oh, I'm gonna wait tables
until I figure it out.

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:16.220
You still gonna do the writing?

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:19.060
- There are no jobs in New York, Phil.
- Mm.

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:21.998
Well, I mean, you know, not right now...

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:26.664
...but I think the newspaper business
is gonna bounce back.

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:30.141
Oh, yeah. No, that is a sensible gamble.

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.711
I can see Corinne's convinced.

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.173
She's onboard.

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:37.216
Well, you can always write just to write.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:39.149
No one can stop you from doing that.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:43.616
I'm not gonna not do what I do.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.556
I just might take a while, you know.

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.195
I'm not gonna give it up.

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:52.823
Well, even if you did, you'd still be there
for Garrett, which is the important thing.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.733
Exactly.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:09.814
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:12.248
I was looking for you.

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:13.816
How you doing?

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.990
I'm okay, how are you?

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:19.184
Good. You wanna take a little walk?

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.028
Sure.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.393
Come on.

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.369
What are you doing out here?

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:30.198
Nothing.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:40.872
What's going on?

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.447
You have to take the job.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:47.214
No. No, I'm not gonna give up
our relationship for a job.

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:50.085
No, no, no. Lookit, lookit.

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:52.393
You need to take the job.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.553
You need to take the job.
This is not about our relationship.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:59.963
This is about asking you to give up
everything again, and I'm not gonna do it.

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:02.069
I'm not gonna do it.

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.936
And if you moved to New York,
it'd be great for a little while.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:09.009
But you'd eventually resent me,
and I can't live with that.

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:11.068
I can't. I won't.

01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:13.778
What's gonna happen to us?

01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:17.819
We can't see each other
every three months.

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:19.851
That's not a relationship.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.423
But I love you.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.470
This is...

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:50.943
- Why don't we just sit down for a minute?
- Yeah.

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:06.794
I really thought that we were something.

01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:09.962
We were.

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.239
We were something.

01:25:50.212 --> 01:25:53.613
He's here. No, I'm picking him up now.
All right, hold on one sec.

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:55.215
- How you doing?
- Hey, buddy.

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:57.112
- What do you think, home or bar?
- Bar.

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.377
Bar. All right.

01:25:58.553 --> 01:25:59.918
Yeah, I'm really disturbed...

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:03.421
...because you would think that you would
find a baby pigeon somewhere.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.389
But I don't see baby pigeons ever.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.495
So, what do you want to do?
Do you just want to have this beer?

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:12.326
I mean, we can get you some harder liquor,
if you want to get really fucked up.

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:15.299
- No, this is good, buddy. Thanks, pal.
- Cool. All right.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.234
Drink a little Frangelico?
No Sambuca shots? Nothing fun?

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:22.274
If you wanna dive off the deep end
into the sadness pool, we go to my place...

01:26:22.444 --> 01:26:26.073
...listen to, like, the <i>Garden State</i>
soundtrack, watch <i>Brian's Song.</i>

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:29.240
- That probably wouldn't be the best thing.
- Want a hug?

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:32.419
I'm okay, buddy. Thanks. This is good.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.418
It's okay.

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:38.423
You need a hug, man. Come on, man.
Come on, buddy. There you go.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.959
Okay. Thanks.

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.296
Why are your eyes closed?

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:45.591
- Mine?
- Mm-hm.

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.735
- Are yours not closed?
- No.

01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:49.393
Oh.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:51.372
Are your eyes...?

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.440
I just close my eyes when I hug.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.532
No big deal.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.482
You playing?

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.584
- Yeah.
- You any good?

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.494
- I'm okay.
- Damn.

01:27:17.132 --> 01:27:19.692
That's one hell of a high score.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:23.732
Yeah. Gonna be real tough to beat.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.885
Hey, Erin, congratulations
on your front-page story.

01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:48.825
Thank you.
I can't believe I'm on the cover. Heh.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:56.928
So keep an open mind. Okay, we are
really lucky to be getting in here early.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.938
I got a tip from Chuck at the Crime desk.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.871
And it's a sublet...

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:05.774
...and it's right in my price range,
and it's available for ten years.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:08.575
Are you kidd...? Is this blood?
Is this blood on the wall?

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:11.213
Did someone get bludgeoned in here?

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:13.877
I'm not really sure of the details.

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:18.549
Something about a narcotics bust
or a cockfighting ring.

01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:21.092
But let's be positive.

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:24.562
Yes. No, you're right. You're right.
Maybe it's just feces.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:26.200
I think it's an up-and-comer.

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:31.735
They got a Boston Market on the corner.
They don't build those just any place.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.374
It smells like a skin infection in there.

01:28:34.542 --> 01:28:36.032
Smells like freedom to me.

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:40.339
The happiest people I know
are single and living alone.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:43.279
Grab it, Erin.
Before you know it, it'll be done.

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:46.716
You'll be trapped and dead.
You gotta do it.

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.219
Are you kidding? It's a shit hole.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.650
The reason your conversation
is having a soundtrack...

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.987
...is because the walls are paper-thin,
all right?

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.426
Erin, you're not gonna
have any privacy in here.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:29:01.065
I actually like music that comes through
the walls. I find it comforting.

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:02.931
I'm gonna take this place.

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:06.005
And I so appreciate what you and Phil
have done for me...

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.903
...but it is time for me to move out.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:11.204
I think you got a view
of the Transamerica building. Oh...

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:17.210
Erin, I know you love this place, but there's
a creepy man watching us hug right now.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:19.615
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:21.415
Yeah.

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:24.651
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.088
All right. You were right.

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:29.424
- Phil. Phil!
- Oh.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:35.067
- Can we go to Boston Market?
- We cannot go to Boston Market.

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.567
<i>Any way you want it</i>

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:38.296
<i>That's the way you need it</i>

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.134
Ah. I look like such an idiot.

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:41.434
Trust me. It works.

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.804
But I'm not into
older women. That's your thing.

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.844
But you asked me for my help, all right?

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:49.950
You have a problem, I have a solution.
These women are good to go.

01:29:50.986 --> 01:29:53.682
Yeah, good to go to an early bird special
at Denny's.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.289
You haven't been out with a lady
in what, six months.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.619
So this is about getting back
on the horse.

01:29:58.793 --> 01:29:59.919
Yeah. No, I know.

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:04.122
Now, sure, you're not gonna find yourself
a Kentucky Derby winner here tonight...

01:30:04.299 --> 01:30:07.632
...but you might find a nice horse
to ride down the Grand Canyon on.

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.770
You get to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon...

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:12.031
...drop her off and
you go about your business.

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:13.504
That makes it worse.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:16.508
Wooh! Sorry I'm running late, boys.

01:30:16.678 --> 01:30:18.009
Three beers, yes?

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:20.079
- Oh, no.
- What's going on?

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.045
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:24.879
What? You're not Charlie Chaplin fans?
This is gonna kill.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:26.850
I love Charlie Chaplin.

01:30:27.022 --> 01:30:29.456
I'm not a fan of the guy
that has the exact mustache.

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.023
Where are you going with this?

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:33.092
At no point during shaving
did you think:

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.788
- "Cool it. I'm gonna look like Hitler"?
- Hitler? Oh, yeah, thought of that.

01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:38.057
It's the plastered hair.

01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:40.224
I knew you guys
were gonna give me shit.

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:43.371
I'm shaving it, and then... I get that
way too far on this side.

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:45.506
- Too far.
- I went too far down this side.

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:48.369
I started going back and forth,
back and forth. I stop.

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:51.569
If I stop now, and you can
still pull off Chaplin. You know what?

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:54.442
If you don't like it,
I'll send you to the gas chamber.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:56.982
- You are doing Hitler.
- I'll do whoever I want.

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:58.414
Pick a character and go...

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.918
- Hey, game faces. Hello.
- Hi.

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:02.420
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.854
You guys didn't go to school with us.

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.493
We did not. No.

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.891
You have a very foxy eye for detail.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.232
- Wanna dance?
- I do.

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:15.166
- Time machine.
- Yeah.

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.201
Maybe my friend Garrett here
can join us?

01:31:17.372 --> 01:31:20.136
I'm good. No. I'm good.
I'm gonna sit this one out.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.276
- Bye, gentlemen. Shall we?
- Let's do it.

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:26.410
<i>Hold on, hold on</i>

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.208
Oh, man, this is ridiculous.

01:31:28.383 --> 01:31:30.112
I know it's ridiculous.

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:33.550
- You know you don't have to be here.
- You think I'm gonna miss this?

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:36.554
No. Well, yeah. No, not this though.
I mean...

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:42.260
Look, Box and I, this is what we do.
We do stupid shit, and we'll be fine.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.058
So if you're worried about us,
don't worry about us, man.

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.064
But you, you don't need to be here.

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.569
Yeah. I know.

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:52.270
Okay, then.
As long as you're thinking about it.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.135
- Okay.
- I'm taking off.

01:31:54.309 --> 01:31:56.470
These dudes don't look
like Chaplin fans to me.

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:59.374
- Oh, boy.
- They look like angry Jews.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:02.980
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:26.404
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:27.939
How was work?

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:31.476
- You know? Uh, it was awesome.
- Good.

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:33.637
Oh, hey. You got a package today.

01:32:33.815 --> 01:32:35.942
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:50.453
It's from Garrett.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:58.135
Oh. What does it say?

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:02.439
"They're gonna be in San Francisco.
Thought you might wanna go."

01:33:02.844 --> 01:33:04.072
Who is?

01:33:06.648 --> 01:33:08.673
The Boxer Rebellion.

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:11.980
That was one of the first bands
that we saw together.

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:14.946
Are you gonna go?

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.017
That depends.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:21.729
On whether or not you'll be my date.

01:33:22.564 --> 01:33:24.031
I can get drunk there, right?

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:28.366
There's sort of
an unidentifiable smell in here...

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:31.528
...that I can't quite just put my finger on.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.640
I don't know, but just push your way in.

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:36.504
It's urine. It's urine. I smell urine.

01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:39.146
Oh, good. That means it's a good club.

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:42.613
And puke. Oh, yeah.
There's a hint of puke. And urine.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.911
- Well, that's even better.
- I know, then. Good.

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:01.928
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.204
Hi.

01:34:06.774 --> 01:34:07.832
Hi, Corinne.

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:11.206
- Hey, Garrett. I like your haircut.
- Thanks. Did something different.

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:14.041
And your dick's in your pants,
so that's good.

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:19.019
I'm gonna go check out the...

01:34:19.187 --> 01:34:22.054
Oh, fuck it. I'm just not gonna be here.
Okay? Okay?

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:23.485
You're gonna just...?

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.590
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.032
What are you doing here?

01:34:34.202 --> 01:34:35.692
I manage the band.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.703
- You do?
- Yes. Ha, ha. Crazy, I know.

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:34:41.276 --> 01:34:45.076
That's... That's great.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.411
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:34:47.582 --> 01:34:51.177
- Wow.
- No, I left the label.

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:54.788
You were right, as it turns out.
I hated the hell out of my job.

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:58.221
Well, I hate to say "I told you so."

01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:00.759
No, you don't.
You love saying "I told you so."

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:02.225
- You love it.
- You're right.

01:35:02.397 --> 01:35:03.864
Who are you kidding?

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:09.125
So are you living in New York?

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:12.573
I actually just moved to Los Angeles.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.002
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:16.439
The band actually lives in L.A.

01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:20.911
And, I don't know if you know this,
I know you're not a huge geography fan...

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:24.142
...but L.A. Is not only in the same
time zone as San Francisco...

01:35:24.319 --> 01:35:27.186
...it's in the same state. So...

01:35:27.355 --> 01:35:29.755
Yeah. It's very close.

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:32.415
Yeah. It's a one-hour flight.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.894
A six-hour drive.

01:35:35.697 --> 01:35:39.155
- Eighteen-hour hot-air balloon ride.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:40.926
If you were to go that way.

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:46.406
Can I ask you a question?

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.399
Yeah.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:52.535
I don't know what your situation is...

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:56.942
I miss you.

01:36:00.355 --> 01:36:02.619
That's not a question.

01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:05.520
Yeah, it is.

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:15.699
<i>I'm always here</i>

01:36:17.205 --> 01:36:22.643
<i>Waiting for you</i>
<i>All alone</i>

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:29.548
<i>Eyes of the night</i>

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:36.415
<i>Just to see</i>
<i>See you home</i>

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:45.689
<i>There's two of us</i>
<i>In it</i>

01:36:45.867 --> 01:36:53.000
<i>They follow</i>
<i>All night</i>

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:56.903
I can't believe she left
without us. That's so weird.

01:36:57.078 --> 01:36:59.911
It's a school night
and she probably didn't like the band.

01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:02.572
She didn't like...
She didn't like me. She hates me.

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.581
How am I gonna win that crazy one over?

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:07.152
Now that we're spending more time
with each other...

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:11.121
...which I couldn't be happier about,
maybe you should get your own apartment.

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:14.193
Just so we don't have to sneak around
her house, you know, like teenagers.

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:18.059
Shh. But for tonight,
let's just go upstairs, like adults.

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:20.564
- That's very mature.
- Okay.

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.503
Shh, shh, shh.

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.002
Wait, wait, wait.

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:33.103
C... Uh...

01:37:33.281 --> 01:37:35.749
Are you guys...? Are you dry humping?

01:37:36.484 --> 01:37:38.816
- No.
- Sorry.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.580
- But I didn't...
- I don't care if you didn't finish. Get off.

01:37:41.756 --> 01:37:43.587
Mommy? Are you okay?

01:37:43.758 --> 01:37:45.157
Maya, statue!
