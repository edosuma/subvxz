00:02.393 --> 00:05.181
Shadow, we're gonna be
releasing you later this afternoon.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.289
Your wife...

00:07.455 --> 00:09.844
...she died in the early hours
of this morning.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.787
My lucky coin.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.671
Give me my fucking coin, dead wife.

00:21.702 --> 00:23.882
You get your life back; I get my coin.

00:23.906 --> 00:25.927
Deal's off, I'm keeping
your fucking coin.

00:25.951 --> 00:28.147
I usually end up getting what I want.

00:28.171 --> 00:30.932
I could be Mr. Wednesday
with a shake of the hand.

00:30.956 --> 00:32.837
I could use a fellow like you.

00:32.861 --> 00:34.104
You're my man now.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.503
When you start to piss me off, I'm gone.

00:36.527 --> 00:37.852
We have a compact.

00:40.488 --> 00:42.000
Hello, Shadow.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.044
- You're working for Wednesday.
- Yeah.

00:45.071 --> 00:47.408
What is it Wednesday is up to?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.613
You want us to go to war.

00:49.637 --> 00:52.765
Believe me, these
New Gods are not going anywhere soon.

00:52.790 --> 00:56.155
They've already replaced us;
Now they want to destroy us.

00:56.755 --> 00:58.916
Your attack will only work against you.

00:58.941 --> 01:00.329
Make it easier for Odin

01:00.354 --> 01:03.102
to convince those who were on the fence
to join his cause.

01:03.946 --> 01:07.012
Guard my
spear as you will guard my life.

01:07.036 --> 01:10.169
Wars are coming, Shadow.
I have a big role for you.

01:11.997 --> 01:14.541
I was killed by a God.
Which fucking God?!

01:14.565 --> 01:15.837
Wednesday.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.656
Fuck that guy.

01:19.570 --> 01:20.831
I guess I believe in him.

01:21.485 --> 01:22.821
I wanna believe in you.

01:22.845 --> 01:24.333
He's Wednesday's now.

01:24.357 --> 01:26.128
Hurts when someone takes what's yours.

01:26.534 --> 01:28.033
Love...

01:28.057 --> 01:30.842
is the most powerful weapon of war.

01:31.136 --> 01:34.237
Love and war may
sit on opposite sides of a coin,

01:34.262 --> 01:36.674
but only so they may never meet.

01:37.270 --> 01:38.978
What do you think happens

01:39.002 --> 01:40.286
when you touch a God?

01:42.383 --> 01:43.962
What happened to our arrangement?

01:43.986 --> 01:45.348
Go help save Shadow.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.065
You owe me a battle, Grimnir.

01:47.424 --> 01:49.271
You really want to know
why I picked you?

01:49.295 --> 01:50.459
Just tell me.

01:50.483 --> 01:52.274
We are the same.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.887
Like father, like son.

01:55.911 --> 01:58.193
Sometimes you remind me of my son.

01:58.217 --> 01:59.368
Your son?

01:59.392 --> 02:00.704
I want to believe in you.

02:00.945 --> 02:03.290
Gods are real if you believe in them.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.551
The storm is coming.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.967
Whoever did this, I curse.

02:15.191 --> 02:16.191
Fuck!

02:19.643 --> 02:21.558
Someone here is gonna die soon.

02:22.024 --> 02:23.894
Don't get in the fucking way.

02:29.074 --> 02:30.598
Sweeney died last night.

02:32.425 --> 02:33.533
I'm gonna kill Wednesday.

02:33.557 --> 02:34.732
Are you gonna try and stop me?

02:34.757 --> 02:35.831
Free country.

02:37.388 --> 02:38.829
State police agencies

02:38.853 --> 02:40.105
have connected these suspects...

02:40.129 --> 02:41.129
Fuck!

02:44.263 --> 02:46.612
My boy is gonna be just fine.

02:46.636 --> 02:47.939
ID?

04:04.832 --> 04:06.964
We are Blood Death

04:07.375 --> 04:10.150
and this is dedicated to the All-Father!

04:11.990 --> 04:14.863
Get ready for war, motherfuckers!

04:15.616 --> 04:18.784
Break every bone in tribute!

04:24.615 --> 04:27.125
Praise the All-Father
for his blessing of death!

04:28.859 --> 04:30.837
Let there be blood!

05:26.405 --> 05:30.603
Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin!

05:30.628 --> 05:33.149
Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin!

05:33.174 --> 05:34.888
Hail the All-father.

05:34.912 --> 05:38.521
Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin!

05:38.546 --> 05:42.041
Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin!

05:42.111 --> 05:43.767
Odin! Odin! Odin!

08:04.540 --> 08:06.020
Yo, Mike.

08:07.102 --> 08:09.820
You drop-balled that entire
pile of frag before lunch?

08:10.024 --> 08:13.026
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Ain't no thing.

08:13.050 --> 08:15.994
Yeah, but you only been on the
line a minute and you roll like that?

08:16.018 --> 08:18.289
Damn, you're a quick study.

08:18.423 --> 08:20.706
Well, I got a good teacher.

08:20.730 --> 08:23.100
Okay. Okay, I'll take that.

08:25.822 --> 08:27.413
Hey, Mike,

08:27.437 --> 08:28.583
you got a minute?

08:28.607 --> 08:30.174
Yeah, sure.

08:32.046 --> 08:33.937
Uh, catch you in the break room?

08:33.961 --> 08:35.495
Yeah, you will.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.748
We got some bones to slap,
so don't even think about

08:37.772 --> 08:40.159
skipping out on the ass-kicking
I'm about to lay down.

08:41.620 --> 08:42.970
Sorry. Sorry, boss.

08:43.827 --> 08:47.552
Mike, you're aware we've been
having issues with staffing.

08:48.497 --> 08:50.344
We just landed this military contract.

08:50.368 --> 08:51.697
There's not a lot of
wiggle room in the bid.

08:51.721 --> 08:53.217
We want to put our best people on it...

08:53.241 --> 08:54.432
And with me being new...

08:54.457 --> 08:56.151
I'd like you to be on the project.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.440
Position comes with a pay raise
and all the overtime you want.

08:59.464 --> 09:00.726
Interested?

09:02.032 --> 09:03.779
Yeah. Of, of course.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.602
Um, I don't want to leave
my team in the lurch.

09:06.626 --> 09:09.102
Well, Sadie's the one
who put you up for the job.

09:09.126 --> 09:10.653
She's got an eye for talent,

09:10.684 --> 09:13.522
thinks it's a good opportunity
for you and I, uh, agree.

09:14.004 --> 09:16.331
I don't know what to say. Uh, thank you.

09:16.615 --> 09:17.615
All right.

09:19.314 --> 09:21.596
And since this is a government thing,

09:21.620 --> 09:23.076
the feds are gonna do
a background check,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.296
make sure you're not a spy or whatever.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.975
Pretty routine. Just, uh,

09:29.063 --> 09:31.388
hide the porn when
they come to pay a visit.

09:32.935 --> 09:34.937
Yeah, sure. Will do.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.974
Look, Brigitte, your boy

09:40.998 --> 09:42.530
was swinging his magic
voodoo dick around

09:42.554 --> 09:43.967
telling me he could
bring the leprechaun back.

09:43.991 --> 09:45.664
- Yo, Brigitte.
- Hiya, George.

09:45.688 --> 09:47.884
It was three fucking
months ago. What is the deal?

09:47.908 --> 09:49.581
I'm gonna be real with you, Lil' Bit.

09:49.605 --> 09:52.497
That big dick is as magic as it gets.

09:52.521 --> 09:55.595
But, heh, he ain't been swingin'
it at no fucking leprechaun.

09:56.525 --> 09:58.068
Let me talk to Samedi.

09:58.092 --> 09:59.634
Like I told you last time,

09:59.658 --> 10:01.201
he's in Hialeah at a loa family reunion.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.794
When the fuck is he back?

10:03.445 --> 10:05.553
I'm the Lord of the Dead's fuck buddy,

10:05.577 --> 10:07.757
not his appointment secretary.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.516
Look, I know Samedi
gave it his best shot.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.692
Potions, gris-gris, the whole nine.

10:13.716 --> 10:16.933
But, heh-heh, resurrecting a
god isn't as easy as you'd think.

10:17.328 --> 10:19.480
Especially when no one
believes in him anymore.

10:19.504 --> 10:22.135
What if you didn't have to
bring him all the way back to life?

10:22.159 --> 10:25.312
I mean, what if he just
had to be undead enough

10:25.336 --> 10:27.444
to perform a relatively simple task?

10:28.296 --> 10:29.946
Such as?

10:30.559 --> 10:32.490
I need something from his hoard. It's...

10:33.324 --> 10:34.539
It's a revenge thing.

10:34.563 --> 10:36.386
There's a certain motherfucker
that's got it coming.

10:36.426 --> 10:40.331
You sure revenge is the only
reason you want this leprechaun back?

10:41.265 --> 10:43.113
Not that it's any of my business.

10:43.137 --> 10:44.854
No, it's really not
any of your business.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.159
But, yes.

10:46.183 --> 10:48.205
Payback's the only itch I gotta scratch.

10:48.229 --> 10:49.926
I'm afraid you're out of luck, Lil' Bit.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.135
There's really nothing more
the Baron can do.

10:52.870 --> 10:54.761
Good news is,

10:55.013 --> 10:57.301
Sweeney's pretty well preserved.

10:57.818 --> 10:59.912
If he didn't have god energy,

10:59.936 --> 11:02.915
he'd be a puddle of Irish stew by now.

11:02.939 --> 11:04.569
Oh, that's fantastic.

11:04.593 --> 11:06.733
A good-looking corpse doesn't
really get the job done.

11:07.901 --> 11:08.965
What about this?

11:08.989 --> 11:11.121
The gris-gris Samedi gave me.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.210
Would this work on him?

11:13.650 --> 11:16.367
The magic in that secret sauce
is meant for you and you alone.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.203
My fucking luck.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.631
Et voilÃ !

11:22.579 --> 11:24.016
This is him.

11:27.447 --> 11:28.752
Really?

13:29.651 --> 13:32.198
_

15:11.079 --> 15:12.319
Hey, Sadie.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.017
You know, I've been thinking, uh...

15:15.757 --> 15:18.214
you might need to find a new hobby.

15:18.238 --> 15:19.978
This domino thing?

15:20.675 --> 15:22.392
I'm kinda tired of taking your money.

15:22.416 --> 15:24.418
Oh, you a dominologist now?

15:25.056 --> 15:27.817
All right, let's see what
you got good tomorrow, brother.

15:27.846 --> 15:29.061
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:29.085 --> 15:30.741
- I look forward to it.
- It's on.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.200
Oh!

15:48.224 --> 15:50.246
- Oh, you okay?
- Oh!

15:50.270 --> 15:52.010
Oh, well, aren't you an angel?

15:52.359 --> 15:54.163
Strong too.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.122
Um, do you need a hand?
It's kind of slippery.

15:57.146 --> 15:58.321
Oh.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.039
My name is Helen. What's yours?

16:01.063 --> 16:02.258
It's Mike.

16:02.282 --> 16:05.198
Oh, that's my husband's name.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.613
God rest his soul.
I just buried him today.

16:09.637 --> 16:12.442
Oh, no. I'm sorry for your loss.

16:12.466 --> 16:16.707
You remind me of him:
Decent, kind, good-hearted.

16:17.862 --> 16:19.629
Well endowed.

16:20.082 --> 16:22.737
The hands tell the tale.

16:23.390 --> 16:27.196
He was also a liar,
a cheat and a con man,

16:27.220 --> 16:30.919
capable of deception and great cruelty.

16:31.541 --> 16:36.030
He was transformed by the grace
and forgiveness of his family.

16:36.054 --> 16:40.817
It was forgiveness that allowed us,
me, to see past his failings.

16:41.858 --> 16:43.121
But a man's sins

16:43.145 --> 16:44.648
can never be undone.

16:44.672 --> 16:47.303
If my husband could speak now,

16:47.327 --> 16:49.827
he'd offer his humble apology

16:49.851 --> 16:52.351
for all the hurt he has caused.

16:52.375 --> 16:57.125
Even though he is now with the angels,
I can hear him say it.

16:59.774 --> 17:01.671
Nice party trick, asshole.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.780
Go fuck yourself.

17:16.695 --> 17:18.186
You motherfucker...

17:18.880 --> 17:20.621
As charged.

17:21.186 --> 17:23.817
Like the new look. Less severe.

17:23.840 --> 17:24.949
What are you doing here?

17:24.973 --> 17:26.690
I'm here to extract you,

17:26.714 --> 17:29.432
pre-emptively, from a... situation.

17:29.456 --> 17:31.936
You're not extracting me from anywhere.

17:32.690 --> 17:34.611
'Kay? I came to Milwaukee
to make a new life for myself.

17:34.635 --> 17:36.090
Doesn't include you.

17:36.114 --> 17:37.483
You were supposed to go to Lakeside.

17:37.507 --> 17:39.398
Or didn't the address
on that driver's licence

17:39.422 --> 17:42.503
make it clear enough to you, Mike?

17:45.428 --> 17:47.561
I don't do your bidding anymore.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.540
I'm not your man.

17:50.564 --> 17:52.846
This is not the best time
to discuss our compact,

17:52.870 --> 17:55.003
given your legal situation.

17:56.347 --> 17:58.722
Well, you're gonna have to
come up with a better con than that.

17:58.746 --> 18:00.781
I've got nothing to do
with this background check

18:00.805 --> 18:01.821
they're running on you.

18:01.853 --> 18:04.858
No? Yet you seem to know all about it?

18:04.882 --> 18:06.469
Oh, let me guess.

18:06.493 --> 18:08.558
A little fucking birdie told you, huh?

18:08.582 --> 18:10.497
Two, as a matter of fact.

18:11.498 --> 18:12.803
Yeah.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.261
Stay away from me.

18:16.904 --> 18:17.992
We're done.

19:20.047 --> 19:21.396
Your attention please.

19:27.225 --> 19:28.551
Whoa.

19:28.575 --> 19:31.423
- Ms. World. I like it.
- Super hot.

19:31.447 --> 19:34.007
Today was supposed
to be roll-out day, was it not?

19:34.031 --> 19:36.907
For the first components
of the SHARD project?

19:36.931 --> 19:39.910
Today you were supposed
to tweet, post, clap back,

19:39.934 --> 19:42.521
trend, and go high key
with our messaging.

19:42.545 --> 19:45.089
But instead of taking
the first glorious steps

19:45.113 --> 19:47.870
towards building a virtual
church of the mind...

19:47.894 --> 19:49.813
...we have this.

19:53.295 --> 19:55.099
The fur-leather combo's pretty dope.

19:55.123 --> 19:56.927
Predicting what the
chimp-people will care about

19:56.951 --> 19:58.145
is an inexact science.

19:58.169 --> 19:59.277
Like climate change.

19:59.301 --> 20:00.365
Talk about cancelled.

20:03.044 --> 20:05.109
Distract. Misdirect.

20:05.133 --> 20:08.504
Make them give a fuck about
what we say is important.

20:08.528 --> 20:12.203
Your job is to provide
and control the narrative.

20:12.227 --> 20:14.161
This...

20:14.185 --> 20:16.579
...is not control.

20:30.767 --> 20:31.788
Mike Ainsel!

21:11.591 --> 21:13.656
You've grown some serious balls.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.333
I'm proud of you.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.704
I told you to stay
the fuck away from me.

21:18.728 --> 21:21.794
Everything that you've heard
and seen since we first met

21:21.818 --> 21:24.101
must have been running around
in there the past few months

21:24.125 --> 21:26.669
and you couldn't talk about any of it

21:26.693 --> 21:28.145
to anyone, huh?

21:29.609 --> 21:31.151
We're gonna play Twenty Questions,

21:31.175 --> 21:32.566
and they're all yours.

21:37.173 --> 21:38.348
Fire away.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.033
You really my dad?

21:43.057 --> 21:44.861
Oh, is that still
a point of speculation,

21:44.885 --> 21:46.689
considering our shared traits?

21:46.713 --> 21:48.386
Huh? Charisma,

21:48.410 --> 21:50.388
strong jawline, way with the ladies.

21:50.412 --> 21:53.609
I am done with the fuckery.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.306
Okay, so no more riddles,

21:55.330 --> 21:56.829
no more talking in circles, okay?

21:56.853 --> 21:58.222
If you want forgiveness, I want answers.

21:58.246 --> 21:59.552
You owe me that much.

22:04.078 --> 22:05.819
- So, Mom?
- Mom.

22:07.429 --> 22:09.538
Another one of your conquests?

22:09.562 --> 22:11.104
That why you abandoned us?

22:11.128 --> 22:12.857
That's two questions.

22:13.783 --> 22:15.892
First one, your mother.

22:15.916 --> 22:17.633
My relationship with her was a mistake.

22:17.657 --> 22:19.852
She was too young and I was...

22:19.876 --> 22:21.332
me.

22:21.356 --> 22:23.377
Oh, so she was just a nut and run?

22:23.401 --> 22:25.423
I never met anyone like your mother.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.033
There was a light about her.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.992
Yeah, yet you still left her.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.167
She left the country.

22:30.191 --> 22:31.429
Oh, really?

22:31.453 --> 22:32.648
'Cause it's not like you went after her.

22:32.672 --> 22:34.630
I'm bound to these shores.

22:35.403 --> 22:38.469
If I were ever to leave,
I would cease to exist.

22:38.494 --> 22:41.003
It's one of the penalties you pay for
being a god who comes to America.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.441
Yeah, well she came back to America.

22:43.465 --> 22:44.790
Along with your son.

22:44.814 --> 22:46.390
If you're telling the truth.

22:47.557 --> 22:49.298
Believe it or not,

22:49.993 --> 22:52.102
I'm just trying to save
the human race from itself.

22:53.693 --> 22:56.755
Wow, people are gonna be so pissed

22:56.779 --> 22:59.933
when they find out the messiah
that everybody's been waiting for...

23:00.317 --> 23:01.450
is you.

23:03.529 --> 23:08.118
I do remember a time when man
lived in harmony with nature.

23:08.142 --> 23:10.207
But now he's made technology his god.

23:10.231 --> 23:11.861
And what's it gotten him?

23:11.885 --> 23:14.037
Pesticides in his water, in his food,

23:14.061 --> 23:16.605
weapons that can destroy
the earth a thousand times over.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.172
New Gods. Heh.

23:19.196 --> 23:20.692
They're just parasites.

23:20.716 --> 23:23.525
The only reason they're here is
to make it easier for humanity

23:23.549 --> 23:26.615
to indulge in its most
self-destructive impulses.

23:26.639 --> 23:30.294
Until the world ceases to exist.

23:30.947 --> 23:33.578
And, without followers, so will you.

23:33.602 --> 23:36.450
Well, I don't see any conflict
in enlightened self-interest.

23:36.474 --> 23:40.672
So, you are on a mission
to save humanity,

23:41.070 --> 23:43.145
and you're just trying
to draft me into this war?

23:43.169 --> 23:45.614
Well, it's a volunteer army.
I can't do it all on my own.

23:48.158 --> 23:52.008
Who in the hell knows if you
actually believe anything you just said?

23:52.033 --> 23:54.917
And you're still running around
not knowing who you really are.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.580
Huh.

23:59.993 --> 24:01.021
We're done.

24:01.045 --> 24:02.825
Well,
you've got about 14 questions left.

24:02.849 --> 24:04.957
Yeah, I kinda got
all the answers I need.

24:04.981 --> 24:07.046
Oh, you can be your own man all you want

24:07.070 --> 24:08.973
until destiny kicks in.

24:11.553 --> 24:13.773
Why don't you ask me if I need you?

24:15.251 --> 24:16.470
Why?

24:16.785 --> 24:18.787
Because war is coming, Shadow.

24:19.748 --> 24:21.813
And if I don't have
the loyalty of my own son,

24:22.291 --> 24:24.990
how can I expect support
from anyone else?

24:26.378 --> 24:28.597
Yes, I need you, Shadow.

24:29.963 --> 24:31.767
And, besides,

24:31.791 --> 24:33.539
we're the only family we have.

24:43.933 --> 24:45.868
Wo-o-ow!

24:50.070 --> 24:52.788
Spectacular new look.

24:52.812 --> 24:54.746
And, and I get it.

24:54.770 --> 24:57.227
White guys are not on trend.

24:57.251 --> 24:59.359
Evolve or perish, am I right?

24:59.383 --> 25:00.752
Sit.

25:01.009 --> 25:02.315
Great idea.

25:03.518 --> 25:05.322
Understand:

25:05.346 --> 25:07.629
The more attention Wednesday gets,

25:07.653 --> 25:09.805
the more powerful he becomes.

25:09.829 --> 25:11.458
So he has some traction.

25:11.482 --> 25:13.678
We put up a cat video,
the old fossil's history.

25:13.702 --> 25:16.028
Yeah, why are we worrying about this?

25:16.052 --> 25:18.944
All it takes is for that old fossil

25:18.968 --> 25:21.599
to throw a lightning bolt
into the power grid

25:21.623 --> 25:23.340
and you're all offline.

25:23.364 --> 25:25.342
Grandpa Viking?

25:25.366 --> 25:27.509
You're totally overreacting.

26:25.382 --> 26:28.734
You were all created by me
for a specific purpose.

26:29.343 --> 26:33.742
Fail at that purpose
and this is what happens.

26:35.517 --> 26:37.040
Are we clear?

26:43.661 --> 26:45.596
Boss, you're killing it,

26:45.620 --> 26:47.206
but, uh,

26:47.798 --> 26:49.550
can we have the room?

26:59.547 --> 27:02.482
I have been feeling a
certain degree of hostility

27:02.506 --> 27:04.117
towards me lately.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.704
You and I are chill, right?

27:07.025 --> 27:08.750
Let's review:

27:08.774 --> 27:10.664
You turned an
intelligence-gathering operation

27:10.688 --> 27:12.841
into an act of war with Shadow Moon.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.617
Okay, we've been through this...

27:14.641 --> 27:17.230
You still haven't
delivered Bilquis to our side.

27:17.254 --> 27:20.196
You even managed to fuck up
your own system upgrade.

27:20.220 --> 27:21.656
Shall I continue?

27:23.125 --> 27:24.615
Fine.

27:25.195 --> 27:28.305
Clearly, I have not been
meeting your level of expectation.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.467
Mea culpa.

27:30.491 --> 27:32.623
King Kamehameha culpa.

27:33.537 --> 27:35.124
You're procrastinating with Bilquis.

27:35.148 --> 27:36.560
Why?

27:36.827 --> 27:38.673
I am being strategic.

27:39.239 --> 27:41.478
I am letting her live into the reality

27:41.502 --> 27:43.393
that she owes me big time.

27:44.064 --> 27:47.247
I'm feeling very optimistic
about the outcome.

27:47.773 --> 27:50.186
I don't give a fuck about what you feel.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.773
Just get it done.

27:52.469 --> 27:55.163
And... what is taking so long
with the financing

27:55.187 --> 27:56.487
for the SHARD project?

27:56.511 --> 27:58.277
You and I both know

27:58.301 --> 28:00.497
that a digital pipeline

28:00.521 --> 28:04.750
direct into every cerebral cortex
on the planet is a no-brainer.

28:05.439 --> 28:08.200
But, as strange as it may sound,

28:08.224 --> 28:12.378
bankers have some hesitation
pumping 20 billion

28:12.402 --> 28:15.773
into a yet-to-be-developed
vanguard technology

28:15.797 --> 28:18.558
that will forever change human
consciousness as we know it.

28:18.582 --> 28:21.126
Your job is to convince these people.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.736
Not make excuses for them.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.806
With respect,

28:25.633 --> 28:29.983
asking the primates for money
to build it feels...

28:31.595 --> 28:33.684
super weak,

28:34.282 --> 28:37.893
when we can just hack into the
World Bank and fucking loot the place.

28:40.474 --> 28:43.247
SHARD requires human participation.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.091
The humans need to believe that
they're the ones building

28:46.116 --> 28:48.138
a virtual church of the mind.

28:48.221 --> 28:49.676
Once it is operational,

28:49.700 --> 28:51.243
we will control it

28:51.267 --> 28:55.425
and the Old Gods will
finally be obsolete.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.206
Hm.

28:57.230 --> 29:00.557
Um, more than they already are?

29:00.581 --> 29:02.559
Don't underestimate Wednesday.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.672
He can still hurt us.

29:05.097 --> 29:07.553
Which is why I'm taking him
off the board.

29:19.437 --> 29:20.868
Let's go, guys!

29:50.196 --> 29:51.440
What happened to Betty?

29:54.200 --> 29:55.861
This is Betty.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.229
What's with the new outfit?

30:04.253 --> 30:07.143
I've been exploring
America's forgotten coast.

30:07.178 --> 30:09.452
You have no idea how many
nude beaches there are

30:09.476 --> 30:11.715
down in the Redneck Riviera.

30:11.739 --> 30:14.544
They're thumping a helluva lot
more than bibles, I can tell you that.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.030
So, where are we headed?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.441
We're off to see Whiskey Jack,

30:23.465 --> 30:25.685
a powerful Native American deity.

30:25.709 --> 30:28.253
We fell out a couple
of hundred years ago,

30:28.277 --> 30:32.107
so I wanna see if the animosity endures.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.503
Is there anyone you haven't
managed to piss off yet?

30:39.854 --> 30:41.239
I'm thinking.

30:45.381 --> 30:46.706
So, these New Gods,

30:46.730 --> 30:49.318
are they really even gods?

30:49.342 --> 30:51.798
If they are, so is indoor plumbing.

30:51.822 --> 30:54.279
But they're dangerous and
they wield a lot of power.

31:01.615 --> 31:04.052
So I reckon you got
a couple of questions left.

31:07.577 --> 31:08.767
Who am I?

31:09.973 --> 31:11.239
Really?

31:13.366 --> 31:15.399
You are the son of the All-Father,

31:15.424 --> 31:18.160
so walk this path with me
and greatness shall be yours.

31:18.197 --> 31:20.278
All right. So does that
make me a god, too?

31:28.163 --> 31:29.358
What the...

31:29.382 --> 31:30.382
fuck.

31:33.777 --> 31:36.003
Well, lookee who's here.

31:46.399 --> 31:47.506
Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.929
No, come on. Wait, no.

31:49.228 --> 31:50.853
God. I should've stayed at home.

31:50.877 --> 31:52.077
Take the wheel.

31:52.274 --> 31:53.643
What...

31:53.667 --> 31:56.167
what are you doing?!

31:56.191 --> 31:59.126
Head straight for 'em. Keep it under 30.

32:00.935 --> 32:03.068
You're fucking serious right now.

32:07.768 --> 32:09.494
On my signal.

32:15.776 --> 32:17.961
Okay, well then, whatever you're doing,
you need to do quick.

32:22.913 --> 32:24.326
What're-what're you doing?

32:24.350 --> 32:25.936
I can't see.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.223
- I can't, I can't, I can't see.
- Hard right now.

32:29.833 --> 32:31.637
Right, right where? This thing'll roll!

32:31.661 --> 32:34.099
Gotta trust yourself
on this one, Shadow.

33:23.191 --> 33:24.671
Nicely done.

33:55.528 --> 33:56.790
Pathetic.

33:59.900 --> 34:00.900
Huh.

34:08.348 --> 34:09.610
Oh!

34:10.237 --> 34:11.717
Wow.

34:12.312 --> 34:15.958
Legs from here to there.
All curves and what not.

34:15.983 --> 34:18.483
- My, my.
- I don't have time for you.

34:18.507 --> 34:20.355
I'm expecting a guest.

34:21.815 --> 34:25.340
Your john is going to be late.

34:28.561 --> 34:30.929
I gave him 50 bucks for him to...

34:30.954 --> 34:33.522
choke the bishop for half an hour,
so we can conversate.

34:37.047 --> 34:38.310
Wow!

34:39.920 --> 34:41.574
I am not a prostitute.

34:42.009 --> 34:45.335
Oh, baby love, we're all prostitutes.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.319
The men who seek me

34:47.780 --> 34:49.303
are not johns.

34:51.206 --> 34:52.842
They are worshippers.

34:56.284 --> 34:58.112
A distinction without a difference.

34:59.885 --> 35:01.147
Hmm!

35:04.988 --> 35:07.532
I am here on a matter of some urgency,

35:07.556 --> 35:11.134
which involves... vous.

35:15.260 --> 35:18.575
Looks like the app I gifted
you has been paying off.

35:18.915 --> 35:20.569
Big time.

35:21.236 --> 35:23.813
Seems like only yesterday
you were sleeping in doorways.

35:25.095 --> 35:28.098
I know you'll get to the
urgency part sooner or later.

35:29.262 --> 35:30.350
Uh-huh.

35:30.927 --> 35:32.625
I'm here to collect.

35:33.234 --> 35:35.995
I enabled you with the means
to not just survive

35:36.472 --> 35:39.345
but to live...

35:39.938 --> 35:41.156
large.

35:44.404 --> 35:47.320
Only seems fair that
you return the favor.

35:51.121 --> 35:53.752
I want you to join our
coalition against Wednesday

35:53.776 --> 35:56.301
- and his irrelevant, medieval friends.
- No.

36:00.914 --> 36:02.644
When you were on the skids...

36:05.614 --> 36:07.007
...did the All-Father

36:07.747 --> 36:12.988
so much as offer
to lend you a caribou pelt

36:13.840 --> 36:15.363
to keep you warm at night?

36:16.205 --> 36:17.575
And you?

36:18.888 --> 36:22.289
You only helped me with
expectation of gain.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.263
I have no love for Wednesday or his ilk,

36:26.287 --> 36:28.613
but I intend to stay neutral.

36:28.637 --> 36:31.529
I have seen war.
It doesn't solve anything.

36:31.553 --> 36:34.217
War only brings misery and death.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.256
Well,

36:38.867 --> 36:41.498
I promise that our war is going
to help a lot of people,

36:41.650 --> 36:43.106
or a few people a lot.

36:43.130 --> 36:46.022
Either way, you get to be one of them.

36:46.046 --> 36:48.523
What do you know about war?

36:50.224 --> 36:52.507
Have you ever endured its agony?

36:52.531 --> 36:53.725
Felt it cut through you,

36:53.749 --> 36:55.841
turning you into a thing
to be covered with dust?

36:57.274 --> 36:58.533
No!

37:46.106 --> 37:49.501
What in the fuck did you do to me?

38:15.911 --> 38:17.946
That's what
happens when you don't call first.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.162
Stay close.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.665
You can get lost in here.

38:59.353 --> 39:00.939
Oh, come on.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.282
Wednesday!

39:03.378 --> 39:04.665
Wednesday!

39:16.762 --> 39:18.006
Wednesday!

39:29.426 --> 39:31.728
I've been awaiting your arrival, Shadow.

39:37.130 --> 39:38.368
Where's Wednesday?

39:38.392 --> 39:40.220
Ah, he's on the wrong path.

39:41.163 --> 39:43.740
You know, for all his bullshit,
he's correct about one thing:

39:44.441 --> 39:46.419
The twilight of the Gods

39:46.443 --> 39:48.745
and the end of humanity are at hand.

39:49.316 --> 39:51.424
And you have a destiny to fulfill,

39:51.448 --> 39:52.790
so don't screw it up.

39:54.408 --> 39:56.085
Or everything will come to an end.

39:59.282 --> 40:00.548
What destiny?

40:00.762 --> 40:02.305
How the fuck should I know?

40:02.329 --> 40:03.939
It's beyond my sight.

40:04.505 --> 40:07.263
But there are those who can guide you.

40:18.858 --> 40:20.366
Who are they?

40:20.390 --> 40:23.568
When your head and your heart
are brought into alignment,

40:24.243 --> 40:25.635
the answers will come.

40:29.110 --> 40:30.578
Follow the Enaemaehkiw.

40:33.403 --> 40:36.084
Woutan, you're not welcome here.

40:36.537 --> 40:37.645
Wisakedjak.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.340
There you are.

40:44.545 --> 40:48.012
Know that I come not to pour
salt on old wounds, but...

40:48.984 --> 40:50.527
we live in perilous times.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.747
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know all about your war.

40:52.771 --> 40:56.938
Then you also know that the
so-called New Gods will not stop

40:57.645 --> 41:01.109
until the memory of all the
old ways has been swept away.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.826
Oh, you know all about
erasing history, don't you?

41:05.435 --> 41:07.387
It was your followers who
slaughtered my people,

41:07.412 --> 41:08.805
and stole our land.

41:09.129 --> 41:10.348
And you?

41:10.527 --> 41:13.332
You did nothing but grow
fat on their worship.

41:13.356 --> 41:16.335
I come in the spirit of forgiveness
to heal the rift between us.

41:16.359 --> 41:18.448
You only come when
it serves your purpose.

41:19.188 --> 41:21.103
So it's always been with your kind.

41:21.626 --> 41:23.516
So go piss up a rope.
I ain't gonna help you.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.431
Then you will die a coward's death.

41:27.022 --> 41:28.878
Watch your tongue, Woutan.

41:32.462 --> 41:34.726
Hey, I think it's time to go.

41:37.293 --> 41:39.063
We'll see ourselves out.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.449
Ah,

41:43.473 --> 41:45.519
terra firma, North Dakota.

41:46.412 --> 41:49.238
The Spirit Lake Nation of
the Lakota Sioux to be exact.

41:51.959 --> 41:53.091
So,

41:53.369 --> 41:55.826
what were you and that
old buzzard talking about

41:55.851 --> 41:57.525
before I arrived, huh?

41:57.662 --> 41:59.814
- Absolutely nothing.
- Oh.

41:59.838 --> 42:01.686
- Nothing, huh?
- Nope.

42:03.434 --> 42:04.434
Nothing.

42:07.367 --> 42:08.257
This you?

42:09.412 --> 42:11.362
Right on time.

42:17.507 --> 42:19.248
Actually, I'm two hours late.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.106
Oh, the universe is always on schedule.

42:22.469 --> 42:25.610
Besides, punctuality:
Virtue of the bored.

42:25.951 --> 42:27.102
Who's this?

42:27.391 --> 42:28.455
Evelyn Waugh.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.631
Who?

42:29.656 --> 42:31.541
The quote, Evelyn Waugh.

42:31.565 --> 42:33.108
This radiant being

42:33.132 --> 42:35.153
is my fiancÃ©e, Cordelia.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.416
Meet my son, Shadow Moon.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.418
- FiancÃ©e.
- 'Sup?

42:42.271 --> 42:44.337
It took me five days to drive up here.

42:44.926 --> 42:47.035
I spent Christmas in
a truck stop on account of you.

42:47.059 --> 42:48.427
Ah, it's a made-up holiday anyway.

42:51.336 --> 42:53.221
- There's a blizzard comin'.
- Mm.

42:53.848 --> 42:55.347
We want to make it to Utah anytime soon,

42:55.371 --> 42:56.392
we better get goin'.

42:56.416 --> 42:57.698
Utah?

42:57.722 --> 42:59.090
We're on our way to see

42:59.114 --> 43:01.571
another old friend of mine: Tklehoai.

43:01.595 --> 43:04.232
The one the Navajo call
the Night Carrier.

43:07.079 --> 43:09.274
Hello? What? You don't wanna do that?

43:09.298 --> 43:11.842
You want us to leave you
here all on your own?

43:14.216 --> 43:16.523
Well, I can't go back
to Milwaukee now. Um...

43:17.567 --> 43:19.872
I guess I'm just gonna
find a place to lay low.

43:20.527 --> 43:21.826
Figure out my next move.

43:21.871 --> 43:23.418
Well, what about Lakeside?

43:26.620 --> 43:28.337
What is it with you and Lakeside?

43:28.361 --> 43:30.426
For one thing, nobody's
looking for you there.

43:30.450 --> 43:32.254
You got an apartment
waiting for you there,

43:32.278 --> 43:35.179
six months' rent paid upfront.

43:36.499 --> 43:38.183
The things we do
for ungrateful children.

43:38.219 --> 43:40.373
I'm good.

43:41.374 --> 43:43.312
Do better when I make my own decisions.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.193
Suit yourself.

43:47.134 --> 43:51.051
Man's free will is
his most prized asset.

43:53.038 --> 43:55.158
Come on, we'll drop you
at the nearest bus station.

44:05.311 --> 44:06.636
Keys to the apartment in Lakeside,

44:06.660 --> 44:08.203
just in case you change your mind.

44:08.227 --> 44:10.798
The lease is in the name
of Emerson Borson.

44:11.975 --> 44:12.975
I'm good, thanks.

44:18.628 --> 44:19.997
Still Betty, huh?

44:20.021 --> 44:22.059
Same soul, different chassis.

44:49.703 --> 44:50.898
Hey, Mike.

44:51.541 --> 44:52.541
Mike!

44:54.926 --> 44:58.012
My intended here does not
want you to catch a chill.

44:58.744 --> 44:59.744
Be in touch.

45:08.853 --> 45:10.265
You're in luck.

45:10.289 --> 45:12.710
I was just about to close up
shop for the day.

45:12.900 --> 45:14.312
Blizzard's on the way.

45:14.336 --> 45:15.685
Storm of the century, they're saying.

45:16.458 --> 45:17.696
Where you headed?

45:17.721 --> 45:19.568
Chicago, please. Uh, one way.

45:19.593 --> 45:20.638
Okay.

45:23.563 --> 45:24.781
Sorry.

45:25.391 --> 45:27.166
That bus has been cancelled.

45:28.568 --> 45:31.045
Oh, uh, okay. Uh...

45:31.658 --> 45:34.340
- How about Kansas City?
- 'Kay.

45:38.186 --> 45:40.388
Also cancelled.

45:41.755 --> 45:42.955
Springfield?

45:42.979 --> 45:44.342
And Springfield...

45:44.366 --> 45:47.395
has been cancelled too.

45:48.649 --> 45:49.649
Columbus?

45:50.484 --> 45:51.920
Nope.

45:53.098 --> 45:56.195
Pretty much everything's shut
down on account of the storm.

45:58.225 --> 45:59.532
Uh, wait.

46:00.104 --> 46:02.628
I do have one.

46:03.255 --> 46:05.798
Leaving for Lakeside, Wisconsin.

46:07.737 --> 46:09.667
Should be here in about 15 minutes.

46:12.264 --> 46:13.763
Yeah. That's, that's fine.

46:13.787 --> 46:14.919
I'll take it.

46:18.835 --> 46:21.075
Do you know anything about Lakeside?

46:21.099 --> 46:24.098
I'm guessing it probably has a lake?

47:29.297 --> 47:30.318
You say it.

47:31.473 --> 47:33.190
He's right there. Come on!

47:33.214 --> 47:35.001
- I dare you. I dare you.
- I dare you.

47:35.042 --> 47:36.672
Okay. I'm gonna... Alison!

47:36.696 --> 47:37.890
- Hey, mister!
- No.

47:37.914 --> 47:38.979
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

47:39.003 --> 47:40.763
My, my friend here, Alison...

47:40.787 --> 47:42.504
- Is just leaving.
- ...thinks you're so cute.

47:42.528 --> 47:44.595
She thinks you're so hot!

47:45.357 --> 47:47.291
She's just too shy to say it!

47:47.315 --> 47:49.119
But we're gonna go because
my parents are here...

47:49.143 --> 47:50.555
I like your hat!

47:50.579 --> 47:52.122
- ...and you're embarrassing.
- What?!

47:52.146 --> 47:53.354
You need to stop it.

47:56.324 --> 47:57.780
You did on the bus!

47:57.804 --> 47:59.390
I, I didn't, no.

47:59.414 --> 48:01.544
- It's your mom and dad.
- Hey, guys!

48:02.288 --> 48:03.288
Hi.

48:28.936 --> 48:29.937
Hello?

48:30.100 --> 48:31.426
Oh!

48:31.451 --> 48:32.815
Oh my gosh.

48:32.839 --> 48:34.599
What are you doing out
in this kind of weather

48:34.623 --> 48:36.355
without a proper coat on?

48:36.649 --> 48:38.983
I think it's two below zero out there.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.803
I just got into town. I didn't...

48:41.239 --> 48:43.043
I didn't think it was
gonna be this cold.

48:43.067 --> 48:46.198
Up here in the Great North Woods,
we call this late summer.

48:46.418 --> 48:48.743
January is what we call cold.

48:49.334 --> 48:50.833
I'm gonna get you a cup of coffee.

48:50.857 --> 48:52.182
Would that be all right?

48:52.206 --> 48:54.402
You think that'll warm
you up a little bit?

48:54.426 --> 48:56.709
Yeah, that, that, that'd be
real nice. Thank you.

48:58.386 --> 49:00.321
You wouldn't happen to know
if Gorman Street's

49:00.345 --> 49:02.018
within walking distance
of here, would you?

49:02.042 --> 49:04.803
Oh, it is, but I'm afraid
that you'd be frozen to death

49:04.827 --> 49:06.892
by the time you got halfway there.

49:06.916 --> 49:08.024
- Okay.
- Oh.

49:08.048 --> 49:09.939
Is there, I dunno,

49:09.963 --> 49:11.332
a cab company I can call?

49:11.356 --> 49:13.976
Yes. Yes, there is.

49:18.885 --> 49:23.319
Chad, I have a gentleman here
that needs a ride up to Gorman Street.

49:23.977 --> 49:26.042
Oh, you're a doll. Okay.

49:26.066 --> 49:27.716
Okay, great. I'll see you in a minute.

49:27.741 --> 49:29.003
Bye-bye.

49:29.548 --> 49:32.620
Our cab driver is out
of town for the holidays.

49:32.855 --> 49:35.138
Abner heads down to the Sea of Cortez

49:35.162 --> 49:37.836
to do some marlin fishing every year.

49:37.860 --> 49:40.428
So I have a friend who's
gonna give you a lift.

49:41.255 --> 49:43.538
- Ann-Marie Hinzelmann.
- Mike Ainsel.

49:43.562 --> 49:44.930
Mike Ainsel.

49:44.954 --> 49:46.584
Mike. That's a really nice name.

49:46.608 --> 49:48.219
- Thank you.
- Yes.

49:49.350 --> 49:51.807
Oh, well, it's nice to have
some company in here.

49:51.831 --> 49:53.678
The store can get really quiet.

49:53.702 --> 49:55.574
That's quite the collection
you got here.

49:56.123 --> 49:59.188
I know it. I am, I'm pretty proud of it.

50:00.883 --> 50:03.297
Is there much demand
for videos these days?

50:03.321 --> 50:06.337
Well, there is when you live
in a town with spotty Internet.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.502
And don't get me started
on the cell service.

50:08.526 --> 50:11.459
Not that I'm complaining;
The extra income helps keep -

50:12.112 --> 50:15.047
I don't know, body and soul
together or something like that.

50:19.032 --> 50:20.314
Oh!

50:20.338 --> 50:21.967
You the fellow that needs a ride?

50:21.991 --> 50:25.038
Chad Mulligan, please
say hello to Mike Ainsel.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.606
Chad's the law in these parts.

50:27.821 --> 50:30.845
And temporary taxi driver
every year 'round this time.

50:32.176 --> 50:34.265
Well, um, I'm parked out front.

50:34.523 --> 50:36.283
Okay, well, give me your coffee cup.

50:36.702 --> 50:37.809
- Thank you.
- All right.

50:39.052 --> 50:40.508
- After you.
- And take care.

50:40.532 --> 50:43.082
And get yourself a proper
coat, for heaven's sake.

50:44.666 --> 50:45.817
What most folks don't know

50:45.841 --> 50:47.210
is that the first settlers here,

50:47.234 --> 50:48.472
Lloyd and Martha Pruitt,

50:48.496 --> 50:49.845
were British loyalists,

50:50.585 --> 50:52.302
a little detail they had
to keep under wraps

50:52.326 --> 50:53.608
in order to be awarded a homestead.

50:57.811 --> 50:59.509
In the light of day,

50:59.954 --> 51:01.434
it's one of the prettiest views around,

51:01.727 --> 51:03.460
if I do say so myself.

51:06.601 --> 51:10.092
So, how long you planning
on being in town?

51:12.781 --> 51:15.514
I don't know. A few days maybe.

51:16.176 --> 51:19.059
Well, we don't get too many
visitors this time of year.

51:19.353 --> 51:21.355
Too damn cold.

51:22.313 --> 51:25.030
Not really the type of town
you can just pick up and move to

51:25.054 --> 51:27.294
on the account of not being
any housing available.

51:27.318 --> 51:31.113
You can't even build an outhouse
with all the zoning restrictions.

51:32.198 --> 51:33.952
I guess I lucked out.

51:33.976 --> 51:34.953
Oh, yeah?

51:34.977 --> 51:36.955
Yeah. Uncle...

51:36.979 --> 51:39.171
rented a spot out here
a few months back.

51:39.723 --> 51:41.028
Thought I'd check it out.

51:43.812 --> 51:47.139
Oh, your neighbor up here
where you're staying is, uh,

51:47.163 --> 51:50.341
is an old friend of mine,
Marguerite Olsen.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.320
You're gonna want to mind
your P's and Q's, though.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.017
She runs the local paper.

51:55.041 --> 51:56.975
So you never know what you say
that'll end up in print.

51:58.827 --> 52:01.090
Okay. Well, I appreciate the heads-up.

52:04.964 --> 52:08.117
All right. Here we are.

52:08.141 --> 52:09.985
That's great. Well, thanks for the ride.

52:10.741 --> 52:11.916
Appreciate it.

52:18.194 --> 52:22.331
If you need anything,
just give me a call.

52:23.082 --> 52:24.264
Will do.

52:24.288 --> 52:26.788
Oh, and make sure to give
Mabel's Diner a try.

52:26.812 --> 52:28.295
Best pasties on the planet.

52:29.261 --> 52:30.610
Top of my list.

53:12.650 --> 53:13.781
No!
