WEBVTT

01:08.151 --> 01:09.732
Omaha Steak.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.561
The deserters bled this
place dry on their way out,

01:12.655 --> 01:14.691
but I had these hidden
away in the freezer.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.692
Working on this beast of burden
in the sun, wind, salt air.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.443
Working on this beast of burden
in the sun, wind, salt air.

01:20.538 --> 01:23.154
Crews used to tell me
that my New York Strips

01:23.208 --> 01:25.199
were the only thing that
got them through the day.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.791
were the only thing that
got them through the day.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.869
| make sure that everyone
gets a hot meal every night.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.711
| make sure that everyone
gets a hot meal every night.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.336
Even now. Especially now.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.552
Where's Jack?

01:37.639 --> 01:40.551
I said I wanted to
get to know you.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.303
And Travis?

01:42.393 --> 01:44.349
Can I see him?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.428
Eat, please.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.191
My family,

01:56.241 --> 01:58.232
they've been taken to land?

01:59.911 --> 02:02.277
We think you could
be happy here.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.571
We can't bring just anybody.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.577
We have to be selective.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.659
But, Jack, he just--

02:08.670 --> 02:10.626
But, Jack, he just--

02:10.713 --> 02:12.749
he had this sense about you.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.174
Generator goes out at bad times.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.141
Stay put.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.305
You shouldn't be here.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.431
I need to know that you're
not gonna do that again.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.816
Connor doesn't let
new folks run free.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.894
- If he had seen you-- - Sorry, okay?
I didn't know.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.520
- If he had seen you-- - Sorry, okay?
I didn't know.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.526
I didn't want to leave
you alone like that.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.279
It's just Connor prefers to get
to know the new folks one-on-one.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.534
Was he-- you know,
he can be a little--

04:52.625 --> 04:55.458
- He made me a steak.
- A steak?

04:55.503 --> 04:57.459
- Jesus.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.211
That's a first.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.293
You always have this
effect on people?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.333
Where's Travis?
I need to see him.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.424
Where's Travis?
I need to see him.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.213
Connor's pretty serious
about his procedures.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.259
Connor's pretty serious
about his procedures.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.675
- If I got caught--
- We won't.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.930
We won't get caught.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.559
We won't.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.027
I'm sorry, I can't.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.102
Can you tell me if my
family made it to land?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.444
Can you tell me if my
family made it to land?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.901
Alicia, do you trust me?

05:27.952 --> 05:29.863
Yes.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.819
Well, then give me some time.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.370
I'll find out.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.796
Don't touch me.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.507
l'll clean up when | get home.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.642
Who says you're going home?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.480
You worried about what's
gonna happen to your dad?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.645
- You don't need to talk to the boy.
- I'm fine.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.231
Guess it all depends on
if you like your dad.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.031
Do you like your dad?
He a good guy?

06:13.122 --> 06:15.374
- Wait outside, Chris.
- I said I'm fine.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.702
'Cause my dad, he
was an asshole.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.754
You ever see what happens when
you clip a man's Achilles?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.796
Whew.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.875
The whole thing just sucks
right back up into the knee.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.547
The whole thing just sucks
right back up into the knee.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.587
Makes a sound like a
firecracker when it lets go.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.463
Makes a sound like a
firecracker when it lets go.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.971
That's what happened
to my old man

06:36.062 --> 06:38.428
last time he laid
his hands on me.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.472
- You must be proud.
- Me? No.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.598
- You must be proud.
- Me? No.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.523
My brother did that one.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.820
Elder looking out
for the younger.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.444
See, that's what you
need to understand.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.484
When I don't come back
with this boat as planned,

06:52.495 --> 06:54.406
When I don't come back
with this boat as planned,

06:54.455 --> 06:56.912
Connor will come looking for me.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.160
And when he sees
what you've done...

06:59.252 --> 07:01.163
Oh...

07:01.254 --> 07:03.745
he might be a little bent.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.673
He has a dozen men,
five boats, three--

07:10.805 --> 07:12.420
Oh...

07:12.473 --> 07:14.885
- Sorry.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.886
Oh, you will be.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.647
That's the thing, senor.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.728
My brother, he's the nice one.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.445
My brother, he's the nice one.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.284
But when he cuts me loose...

07:37.957 --> 07:40.323
I'm gonna take that
daughter of yours apart.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.078
In my time, I've known
men who inspire fear.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.330
In my time, I've known
men who inspire fear.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.624
Do you know what
they have in common?

07:49.677 --> 07:52.669
They never say how
frightening they are.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.226
Chris.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.149
You just gonna let him
talk to you like that?

08:10.239 --> 08:12.355
He's scared. That's
what they do.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.773
That's what we all do.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.244
And I got what
information we needed.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.162
You saw that.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.501
You're just gonna
leave him there?

08:22.543 --> 08:24.408
Where is he gonna go?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.245
I can stay.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.092
Stand outside the
door and watch him,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.010
but do not engage.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.088
- I understand.
- No wandering off.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.805
- I understand.
- No wandering off.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.225
- Okay.
-Perdon.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.146
- He required attention.
- What does that mean?

08:46.234 --> 08:48.520
Medical attention.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.560
Okay. I had to ask.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.186
Okay. I had to ask.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.488
I need to dispose of this.
Excuse me.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.115
Wait.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.818
Let me clean these. They're
gonna get infected.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.699
I'll take care of it.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.455
He should be upstairs.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.211
He wants to be
useful, stay busy.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.629
So...

09:17.014 --> 09:17.924
What?

09:20.059 --> 09:22.721
So his mind doesn't go
places it shouldn't.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.442
How is he?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.281
Got a ways to go.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.454
Connor is their leader.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.911
Our prisoner is his brother.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.125
This provides leverage.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.204
So we're looking now for
a cluster of five boats.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.671
So we're looking now for
a cluster of five boats.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.582
Here.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.751
These five near the coast.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.419
Could be they're fishing boats.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.757
They tend to travel together.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.214
Okay, so that's where we go.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.719
Mm-hmm.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.988
What are you doing?
Why are we heading north?

10:18.075 --> 10:20.566
- Turn it back.
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.532
Senora, I made arrangements.
Do you understand?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.162
We're gonna miss our
window to crossing--

10:25.249 --> 10:27.410
We're not crossing anywhere
without my family.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.591
Are you gonna make me
be the one to tell her?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.843
There's no telling her anything.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.221
Your people are gone. There's
no getting them back.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.849
I need half a day.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.433
I could have left you in the water.
Should I have?

10:55.905 --> 10:58.863
We can do both. We can
go get your family

10:58.949 --> 11:00.655
and then we can continue south.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.200
Victor, he's waiting for us.
We have to go.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.403
He '/I understand

11:05.414 --> 11:06.745
He '/I understand

11:06.957 --> 11:08.242
my obligations.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.199
It's a capitation fee.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.205
You said, two persons.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.377
I only have money for two persons.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.838
Relax.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.257
Okay, do you have
money for seven more?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.131
- Because I don't.
- Everything is a negotiation.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.884
- I'll get us across.
- You'll get us killed.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.345
Hey, lady.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.098
You expect to sneak up
on Connor and his people

11:30.189 --> 11:31.929
on a 40-meter yacht?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.764
We don't have to sneak.
They're expecting the boat.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.809
And what do you think is gonna
happen when we get there?

11:35.820 --> 11:36.855
And what do you think is gonna
happen when we get there?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.895
We board, we use force if we have
to, and we get our people back.

11:38.906 --> 11:39.941
We board, we use force if we have
to, and we get our people back.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.693
Are you listening to this?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.903
Anyone who's not up for it can
stay behind with the kids.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.284
No one is gonna
stay on the boat.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.115
If we're going to attack,
we need everybody.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.121
- Nick, Christopher--
- No.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.454
You have to stop treating
them like children.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.585
- But they are.
- Not anymore.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.000
They stay behind.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.424
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.975
You bought yourself half a day.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.429
Consider us even.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.144
The smaller the boat, the
smaller the signature.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.729
We don't bother with those.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.158
Why not?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.233
We want these midsized vessels.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.745
We want these midsized vessels.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.823
Long range, lots of supplies.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.613
Your job is to track them down.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.372
Assign each one a number.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.961
I'm sorry.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.212
Log the time, speed,
and position here.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.884
Cool?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.794
And then?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.384
Wait until Connor gives
us the green light

12:47.475 --> 12:48.760
and then we can make contact.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.188
I'll do something else.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.263
Connor's serious. Everyone
pulls their weight.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.434
Connor's serious. Everyone
pulls their weight.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.107
I wouldn't know what to say.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.527
You reeled me in.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.821
I wasn't trying to reel you in.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.738
| just wanted
someone to talk to.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.120
I know. I'm sorry.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.628
How do you choose?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.254
| asked Connor the same thing.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.003
He said this is the world now.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.084
This one lives, that one dies.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.960
This one lives, that one dies.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.005
Maybe it was always like that.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.301
Maybe it was always like that.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.179
Maybe we just spent a lot of time
trying to convince ourselves

13:33.270 --> 13:35.135
the laws of nature didn't apply.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.847
Right, if you believe
in the right things,

13:37.900 --> 13:39.891
ate the right things, wore our
goddamn seat belts...

13:39.902 --> 13:41.767
ate the right things, wore our
goddamn seat belts...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.482
We'd be safe.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.153
Yeah.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.323
But nobody was.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.366
You got to pick one.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.737
We were floating.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.121
He was on fire one second,

15:18.208 --> 15:20.460
cold the next.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.377
And he was so thirsty,

15:23.464 --> 15:25.830
but I ran out of water to give him.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.874
Surrounded by it,

15:27.885 --> 15:29.091
Surrounded by it,

15:29.136 --> 15:31.127
and all he could do was moan

15:31.138 --> 15:32.674
and all he could do was moan

15:32.765 --> 15:35.302
till he lost his voice.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.383
His breath got shallow.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.850
His breath got shallow.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.761
He looked up at me.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.805
I heard the fluid in his chest.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.896
I heard the fluid in his chest.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.685
I didn't have anything
to stop him turning.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.690
And he knew that, too.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.067
He made me get real close.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.232
I could barely hear him.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.318
And he whispered,
"Don't let me drown."

15:55.329 --> 15:56.409
And he whispered,
"Don't let me drown."

15:59.541 --> 16:01.532
So I put my hands
around his throat

16:01.543 --> 16:03.158
So I put my hands
around his throat

16:03.253 --> 16:05.084
and l squeezed.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.583
And then I pushed him
out of the raft.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.550
You did what you had to do.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.599
I did what you made me do.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.677
When Connor found me
just this side of death,

16:20.688 --> 16:22.178
When Connor found me
just this side of death,

16:22.272 --> 16:24.399
the first thing he said to me was,

16:24.483 --> 16:26.223
"What do you have to offer?"

16:28.028 --> 16:30.019
I offered him your Abigail.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.065
I offered him your Abigail.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.572
But I asked for you.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.244
Don't fight it. Shivering is your
body's way of warming itself up.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.416
Don't fight it. Shivering is your
body's way of warming itself up.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.748
Fantastic tidbit.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.834
Please, keep 'em coming.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.960
Please, keep 'em coming.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.004
You'll recover faster and
I need you to steer.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.755
You'll recover faster and
I need you to steer.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.011
You're white-knuckling my wheel.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.228
You're white-knuckling my wheel.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.975
You sure you want to give it up?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.186
One more thing.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.480
Breath bated.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.657
Don't send Nick on
any more errands.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.530
Pardon?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.906
You let him go get your man.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.867
Your son offered his assistance.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.288
Your son offered his assistance.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.212
Alone? In the dark?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.623
Without Luis, none of
us gets into Baja.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.254
And that's what you
said you wanted, right?

17:34.344 --> 17:35.720
He could have died.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.510
He knows how to move
through this world.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.509
Yeah, just because he does
doesn't mean he should.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.761
I saw your son's potential within
five minutes of meeting him.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.846
And he was in withdrawal.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.892
And he was in withdrawal.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.806
You've hovered over
him for 19 years

17:49.902 --> 17:51.767
and you still don't know
what he's capable of.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.898
You don't know what he's
capable of when he's--

17:56.950 --> 17:58.781
He has that look again.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.236
Madison.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.450
Do not come between
me and my son.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.165
Good one. Isolated, midsized.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.416
Good one. Isolated, midsized.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.502
Call that one MY44.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.094
Call that one MY44.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.596
Note it as a possible
acquisition.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.018
What?

18:31.151 --> 18:32.857
Jack, what's wrong?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.769
Nothing.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.155
What's MY44?

18:46.667 --> 18:48.123
Wait.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.454
MY44 is the Abigail?
How is that possible?

18:53.465 --> 18:55.046
MY44 is the Abigail?
How is that possible?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.128
- Calm down, all right?
- How are they here already?

18:57.177 --> 18:59.509
If they dropped them down the coast,
that's not enough time for them--

18:59.596 --> 19:01.211
Look, I don't know what
they were doing out there.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.972
They're not supposed to
be back for two hours.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.429
Where is my family?!

19:09.314 --> 19:11.054
Did you know?

19:12.734 --> 19:15.111
Did you know?!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.269
- Tell me!

19:16.321 --> 19:17.777
No, stop!

19:19.366 --> 19:21.652
- Stop.
- Get off me.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.411
What happens on the
other boats, Jack?

19:36.758 --> 19:39.249
The other people, does Connor--

19:39.303 --> 19:42.010
It's not Connor. lt's Reed.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.219
Are they gone?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.728
I don't know.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.228
I have to find them.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.274
I have to find them.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.736
- How?
- We'll get a boat and we'll go south.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.817
- Alicia, that's crazy.
- l have to find them, Jack.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.364
- Alicia, that's crazy.
- l have to find them, Jack.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.574
Then-- then I'll come with you.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.920
All right? We'll go together.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.995
All right?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.973
- Don't pull that shit again.
- Strand said it couldn't wait.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.100
Then Strand should have gone.
Nick, what were you thinking?

20:34.149 --> 20:36.356
I don't mind it out there.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.653
- Honestly.
- We have enough problems.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.773
- Please don't add to them.
- Okay.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.900
- Don't worry me like that, Nick.
- I'm sorry.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.368
Never again, promise.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.157
You're getting
comfortable with that.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.624
I'm not.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.090
This one's down to five knots.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.808
You think they have
mechanical problems?

21:08.892 --> 21:10.803
Maybe, yeah.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.385
That's the sort of thing that might
get Connor to drop everything.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.814
That's a good ship.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.975
Okay, well, when Connor does
recon, that'll be our chance.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.317
Okay, well, when Connor does
recon, that'll be our chance.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.774
It'll be a small window,
but it'll be enough.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.569
There's five boats
moored by the shoreline.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.741
There's five boats
moored by the shoreline.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.824
We take one, we go.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.416
We take one, we go.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.167
Are you sure about this?

21:46.888 --> 21:48.970
Make the call.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.642
Connor, this is Jack, over.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.643
What do you want with us?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.521
They're putting
your girl to work.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.602
- How?
- However they want.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.023
- How?
- However they want.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.815
And me?

22:08.910 --> 22:11.071
You put us in the raft.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.493
You did that.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.375
We couldn't risk
bringing the boy.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.832
He was gonna turn.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.463
I saw your face.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.845
You knew.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.923
You knew what would happen.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.014
You knew what would happen.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.844
You knew the right thing to do

22:36.938 --> 22:38.724
and you chose.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.727
You chose the other.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.481
You surprise me. You
have no skin in this.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.527
You surprise me. You
have no skin in this.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.576
Neither do you.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.653
Well, if it were my
daughter, l'd...

22:54.664 --> 22:56.404
Well, if it were my
daughter, l'd...

22:56.458 --> 22:58.198
But it's not.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.005
Look!

23:07.386 --> 23:09.092
Look.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.968
Time to knock on the front door.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.682
I have a son.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.106
He watches me.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.482
Waiting to see how
I'll face it--

23:31.535 --> 23:33.526
the violence.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.617
the violence.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.161
I tried so hard not
to be part of it.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.283
I knew it would change me.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.579
And that he'd see it.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.674
I can't tell you what
you want to hear.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.974
I'm no better than the
man that cut the rope.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.515
I cut the rope.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.644
What you did to that boy,

24:08.655 --> 24:10.611
What you did to that boy,

24:10.699 --> 24:12.530
I did the same.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.577
To my son's mother.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.666
So I know what it costs.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.960
It cost a part of me.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.593
How do | get that part back?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.133
You don't.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.183
I'm sorry.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.895
I'm so sorry for all of this.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.983
We can--

24:53.074 --> 24:55.065
we can be more

24:55.076 --> 24:56.816
we can be more

24:56.912 --> 24:58.903
than what we've
become, can't we?

25:04.586 --> 25:06.542
I don't know.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.249
Wait.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.421
What happens to you?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.510
Connor said he could use me.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.015
People don't use me.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.659
How you doing out
there, sunshine?

25:42.249 --> 25:44.786
Better than you.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.618
- It hurt?
- Nah.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.878
It's just a scratch.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.009
You know you're screwed, right?

26:01.810 --> 26:04.552
Brother's got big plans for
your pretty sister friend.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.845
Do I need to gag you?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.931
You know, you don't
look like your sister.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.227
You know, you don't
look like your sister.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.194
You don't look like your
old man's lady either.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.358
I'm beginning to think you
and I have a lot in common.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.075
I'm beginning to think you
and I have a lot in common.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.153
We're outsiders.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.700
We're outsiders.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.740
Tell me, where is your real mom?

26:26.751 --> 26:28.127
Tell me, where is your real mom?

26:29.629 --> 26:32.621
Yeah, it sucks.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.836
Let me tell you something.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.168
Orphan to orphan.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.672
Be prepared.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.718
Be prepared.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.019
'Cause when the time comes,

26:45.103 --> 26:47.094
these people you
call your family,

26:47.105 --> 26:48.345
these people you
call your family,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.431
they will put you down
like you're a stray.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.852
they will put you down
like you're a stray.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.562
Blood's all that matters now.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.779
Blood's all that matters now.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.940
That one's for free, cherry.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.239
Hey, you okay?

27:06.708 --> 27:08.664
You all right?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.200
I'm fine.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.377
Want to come upstairs?
What is it? What?

27:12.464 --> 27:13.954
What is it?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.914
I froze.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.000
I let them on the boat.
This is my fault.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.217
I let them on the boat.
This is my fault.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.295
- Look, man-- - No, no, I pull the
trigger, none of this would happen.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.341
- Look, man-- - No, no, I pull the
trigger, none of this would happen.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.423
I pull the trigger, my dad and Alicia are
on the boat, we're off to Mexico already.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.799
I pull the trigger, my dad and Alicia are
on the boat, we're off to Mexico already.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.639
What, you gonna shoot a pregnant woman?
Come on, man.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.679
I wouldn't shoot a pregnant woman.
This isn't on you.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.226
I wouldn't shoot a pregnant woman.
This isn't on you.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.478
What if I freeze again?

27:35.904 --> 27:37.815
I want to make up for it.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.897
Okay, butjust don't let all this
get inside your head, all right?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.489
Okay, butjust don't let all this
get inside your head, all right?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.195
Yeah?

27:43.286 --> 27:45.402
Okay.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.201
Okay.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.891
Keep it short.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.890
- Travis.
- Alicia.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.063
You're okay.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.061
Are you?

28:16.152 --> 28:17.437
Yeah.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.024
I don't know if
they got to land.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.447
What do you mean?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.365
The Abigail's back too soon.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.443
They can't have dropped them and
made it back this soon, Travis.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.864
They can't have dropped them and
made it back this soon, Travis.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.241
No, they got there.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.448
How can you be sure?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.034
It's your mom.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.040
They'll be fine.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.965
We're gonna try and get
out of here tonight.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.917
With him?

28:43.012 --> 28:45.003
He doesn't want to be
here any more than we do.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.675
He doesn't want to be
here any more than we do.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.386
Go with him.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.728
We're coming for you, too,
while Connor's doing recon.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.261
- That's-- - No, if you
have a way out, take it.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.938
- I'll be back for you.
- Alicia.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.858
I put us in this mess and
I'm gonna get us out of it.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.814
No, no, it wasn'tjust you.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.946
Alex, the woman from the raft.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.068
- What?
- She's here.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.651
She told them
everything about us.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.786
We've got to go.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.617
If you can't come
back for me, don't.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.076
- No.
- Get the hell out of here.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.704
- No.
- Alicia.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.084
Your mother would
never forgive me.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.957
She'd never forgive
me if I left you.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.299
- Now.
- Promise me, okay?

29:20.383 --> 29:22.339
If it comes down to it,
you just go, okay?

29:22.427 --> 29:24.042
Just go.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.095
See anyone?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.646
Not a soul.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.024
Hey, asshole,
what are you waiting for,

29:41.112 --> 29:42.727
a written invitation?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.317
Get your ass back here. Over.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.408
Reed, you're pissing me off.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.487
Drop anchor, shut it down. Over.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.863
Drop anchor, shut it down. Over.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.288
You can have your brother
when I get my family back.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.459
You can have your brother
when I get my family back.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.965
Madison, is that you?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.011
Yes.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.932
What'd you do with him?

30:13.978 --> 30:16.685
Nothing yet.

30:16.731 --> 30:19.143
What about Ben and Red?

30:21.945 --> 30:24.311
You promised us safe passage,

30:24.405 --> 30:26.361
they didn't follow
through on that.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.733
Let me talk to Reed.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.119
- No.
-Let me talk to him now!

30:40.004 --> 30:41.960
He's alive.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.213
You want him, trade.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.087
One hour.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.134
Your brother for my family.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.137
Okay, I'll play.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.353
One man with Reed.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.431
If he's unharmed, you get yours.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.057
If he's unharmed, you get yours.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.811
I'll go. I'll go.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.732
I'll bring him. One hour.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.956
I'll go, Mom.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.959
Chris?

31:32.765 --> 31:35.017
Chris? Hey.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.180
What happened?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.814
He was gonna turn.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.948
Oh, my God.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.249
Chris said he was gonna turn.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.498
- Where's Chris?
- He just left.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.804
We're going south. This is done.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.805
Nothing is done.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.650
Chris?

32:29.238 --> 32:31.194
He's dead.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.624
He was sick.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.042
How did you know?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.332
He was gonna turn.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.506
- No, we didn't know that.
- I knew that.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.092
That's what happens now.
That's what happens.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.066
Whose gun?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.773
Reed's.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.906
It was on the deck after
we took him down and |--

33:20.581 --> 33:22.913
The kid just blew a
hole through your trade.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.950
- It's okay.
- Did ljust screw everything up?

33:24.961 --> 33:26.622
- It's okay.
- Did ljust screw everything up?

33:26.713 --> 33:28.704
Were they gonna trade
him for my dad?

33:28.715 --> 33:29.830
Were they gonna trade
him for my dad?

33:29.882 --> 33:32.544
We'll figure it out, okay?
Trust me.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.633
What are we gonna do?

33:38.725 --> 33:41.432
We're gonna get him back.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.687
You know I had to, right?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.523
You get that? That I had to?

33:52.613 --> 33:55.025
It's okay, Chris. It's okay.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.534
Thank you.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.612
It's over now.

34:11.799 --> 34:14.586
- Go get the girl.
- But you said that I could--

34:14.677 --> 34:17.089
Jack, plans have changed.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.925
- Where's my family?
-You'// see them soon.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.260
Your time here is done.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.229
Chris can't see this.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.852
Ugh.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.686
Think I'm actually starting
to get used to this.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.656
Please don't.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.358
It's what we do now--

34:40.453 --> 34:42.614
spill blood, clean it up,

34:42.705 --> 34:44.491
spill it again.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.035
Chris said he was gonna turn.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.753
He wasn't, was he?

35:10.775 --> 35:13.437
- Careful.
- Oh.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.644
No,no,no,no.
Wait, wait, wait.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.572
Not yet.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.164
Not yet.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.260
Take the weapon, Daniel.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.764
Take the weapon.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.189
It's time.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.280
It's time.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.193
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.992
Let's go.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.841
Alicia?

36:27.226 --> 36:28.966
Alicia?

36:32.857 --> 36:34.518
Alicia!

36:42.366 --> 36:44.322
Mom, let me go.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.905
- No.
- No, let me go. Listen to me.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.612
If something happens,
it's better if it's me.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.663
- Nick.
- Everybody else needs you.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.207
- No.
- And I'm better with the boat.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.044
Why won't you just let me go?

36:57.089 --> 36:58.829
Because you want to.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.259
Jesus.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.768
- Be careful.
- Okay.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.480
Let's get this over with.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.126
I can only see Travis.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.572
You're not supposed to be here.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.025
I'm going now.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.112
You upset Jack, heartbreaker.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.239
You upset Jack, heartbreaker.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.704
No, you can stay in
the cage for now.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.921
No, you can stay in
the cage for now.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.365
Where's my daughter?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.902
You'll get her when | see
my brother's all right.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.578
- Maddy?
- Travis.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.346
No! Reed, no!

39:21.734 --> 39:22.894
Okay, go.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.711
- Alicia!

39:49.595 --> 39:51.460
Why are you running?

39:51.514 --> 39:54.381
I said I could get you out of here.
We can go now.

39:54.433 --> 39:57.300
- My family came back for me.
- So?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.059
What, you were just gonna leave?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.072
Alicia. Come on, Travis.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.695
She's there.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.283
You're going back
to those people?

40:18.332 --> 40:20.618
Alex told us what they did.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.995
Is that who you really
want to be with?

40:23.087 --> 40:25.920
The people who abandoned
her will abandon you.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.712
Alicia!

40:32.304 --> 40:34.465
Alicia, please.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.049
I'm sorry.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.856
Alicia. Alicia!

40:53.576 --> 40:55.487
Alicia.
