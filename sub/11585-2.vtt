(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.137 --> 00:05.739
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.476
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.509 --> 00:10.344
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.378 --> 00:11.712
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.184
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.055
[prisoners yelling]
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

00:21.089 --> 00:23.191
I LOVE COUGARS.
OHH...

00:25.093 --> 00:27.528
(Cragen)
WELL THIS SHOULD WIND DOWN
IN ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.397
SEPTEMBER IS HELL.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.631
(Greylek)
WHY IS THAT?

00:30.664 --> 00:33.101
(Cragen)
GET ABUSED
AT SUMMER CAMP AND NOBODY TELLS

00:33.134 --> 00:34.435
UNTIL THEY GET BACK HOME.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.537
GREEK WEEK PLUS ALCOHOL

00:36.570 --> 00:38.439
EQUALS RAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.308
AND THERE'S A SPIKE
IN D.V. CALLS BECAUSE

00:40.341 --> 00:42.076
ALL THE KIDS ARE BACK
IN SCHOOL.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.711
WHERE SHOULD I
START?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.079
LISTEN, UH...

00:45.113 --> 00:46.347
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO BE SIFTING

00:46.380 --> 00:48.582
THROUGH STATEMENTS,
CORROBORATING ALIBIS.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.418
WE GET SOMETHING CONCRETE,
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.120
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.155
NO ONE IS DELIBERATELY
KEEPING YOU

00:54.188 --> 00:55.389
OUT OF THE LOOP,
MS. GREYLEK.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.524
I'M SURE
IT'S AN OVERSIGHT

00:56.557 --> 00:58.092
BUT JUST SO
WE'RE CLEAR,

00:58.126 --> 00:59.193
I'LL BE SHOWING UP
AT CRIME SCENES

00:59.227 --> 01:00.528
AND SITTING IN
ON INTERVIEWS FROM NOW ON.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.096
THAT WON'T LAST.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.297
LOOK CAPTAIN, I'M COMMITTING
TO DOING THIS JOB

01:03.331 --> 01:04.432
AND DOING IT WELL.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.799
AND I'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.536
TOLD YOU I
DIDN'T TOUCH THE WHORE!

01:08.569 --> 01:09.837
YOU'RE WIFE'S
SITTING NEXT DOOR

01:09.870 --> 01:11.372
LOOKING LIKE SHE
WENT A ROUND WITH TYSON.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.540
WHAT CAME FIRST,
FRANK?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.208
THE ASS-WHIPPING
OR THE RAPE?

01:14.242 --> 01:15.409
WHAT'D SHE DO,
BURN YOUR DINNER?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.810
THE BITCH SAY
I RAPED HER?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.247
LISA HAS
VAGINAL TEARING.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.548
YOU FORCED HER
TO HAVE SEX.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.882
THAT'S A QUARTER BID
MINIMUM.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.884
AND TRUST ME, YOU'RE GONNA
BE FEELING QUITE PETITE

01:23.917 --> 01:25.619
NEXT TO THE MUSCLE MASS
UPSTATE.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.122
THAT DOESN'T SCARE ME.
"SWEET MEAT."

01:28.156 --> 01:29.390
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE GONNA SAY

01:29.423 --> 01:30.824
WHEN THEY REACH FOR YOU
IN THE DARK.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.436
LISA DEERING
IS IN INTERVIEW "B"

01:42.470 --> 01:43.471
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SIT IN.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.140
THERE BETTER NOT BE
A SINGLE MARK ON THE SUSPECT

01:46.174 --> 01:47.908
WHEN HE'S TRANSFERRED
TO THE TOMBS, CAPTAIN.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.910
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNLESS WE GET A CONFESSION.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.512
WHY NOT?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.314
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T HURT ME.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.816
SO THE KNOCKS TO YOUR NOGGIN
WERE JUST LOVE TAPS?

01:55.849 --> 01:57.218
NOTHING HAPPENED.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.419
MRS. DEERING...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.154
TESTIFYING
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND

02:00.188 --> 02:01.589
IS THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP HIM.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.857
YOU DON'T KNOW FRANK.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.193
AND I NEED HIM.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.328
LISA, HE'S ESCALATING.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.563
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE,
YOU NEEDED 30 STITCHES.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.765
I FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

02:11.799 --> 02:12.800
CAN I GO?

02:12.833 --> 02:13.834
IF YOU LEAVE NOW,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.169
THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU,

02:15.203 --> 02:16.537
YOU'LL BE IN THE MORGUE.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.175
THE E.R. AT ST. LUKE'S
HAS A THREE-YEAR-OLD

02:21.209 --> 02:22.710
WITH A SUSPICIOUS FRACTURE.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.512
I'LL RIDE ALONG
WITH YOU.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.447
UH, MAY BE NOTHIN'.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.582
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

02:28.616 --> 02:29.717
THIS KID SAYS
HE'S GOT INFORMATION

02:29.750 --> 02:30.751
ABOUT A SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.785
WHERE DO YOU WANT HIM?

02:31.819 --> 02:34.288
MY DESK.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.157
HERE, WHY DON'T
YOU HAVE A SEAT?

02:40.761 --> 02:43.264
OKAY.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.165
RELAX, TAKE A BREATH.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.969
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.339
ERIC BYERS.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.510
I DON'T, UM...

02:56.544 --> 02:58.946
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.948
AND THEN I...FIGURED--

03:00.981 --> 03:03.717
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.657
[crying]
THIS--THIS IS HARD TO SAY.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.725
TAKE YOUR TIME.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.304
I LOVE HIM.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.740
BUT I KNOW IT'S WRONG.

03:26.774 --> 03:30.278
AND IT'S--IT'S GETTING HARD
NOT TO TOUCH.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.413
OKAY, ERIC,
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:35.015 --> 03:37.885
IT'S--IT'S CORY.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.756
HE'S MY STEPBROTHER.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.954
HOW OLD ARE YOU, ERIC?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.393
17.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.961
OKAY, I THINK WE NEED
TO CALL YOUR PARENTS.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.330
NO...NO!

04:56.364 --> 04:58.866
WHY NOT?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.968
IT'S JUST MY MOM.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.035
DAD LEFT US.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.738
HER NEW HUSBAND
DOESN'T LIKE ME.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.906
WELL, I THINK--

05:05.939 --> 05:07.107
I THINK SHE NEEDS
TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.411
THIS WILL KILL HER.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.547
BESIDES, I--I HAVEN'T...

05:13.581 --> 05:16.384
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.919
AT LEAST--
AT LEAST I DON'T THINK.

05:18.952 --> 05:19.920
THINK.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.456
I'VE BEEN DRINKING
A LOT.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.024
BLACKING OUT.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.829
I--I JUST--
I JUST WANT--

05:28.862 --> 05:31.999
I JUST WANT THE PICTURES
IN MY HEAD TO STOP.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.436
OKAY, WHY DON'T--
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

05:35.469 --> 05:37.438
OKAY?
JUST SIT BACK DOWN.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.616
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT?

05:54.755 --> 05:59.059
IF I TELL YOU,
YOU'LL HATE ME.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.894
EVERYBODY WILL.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.101
IS THERE A REHAB
I CAN GO TO?

06:08.135 --> 06:12.440
REHAB IS FOR PEOPLE
WITH ADDICTIONS.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.777
SURE FEELS LIKE
I HAVE ONE.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.713
I CAN'T SLEEP.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.750
I CAN'T...THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.622
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.744
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:50.778 --> 06:53.481
I'VE NEVER HAD A PEDOPHILE
TURN HIMSELF IN BEFORE.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.215
HIS MOTHER JUST REMARRIED.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.818
COULD HE BE MAKING IT UP
TO GET SOME ATTENTION?

06:57.851 --> 07:01.021
WHO WOULD INVENT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.456
I MEAN, THE DRINKING

07:02.490 --> 07:04.191
AND THE WAY HE
CARESSED THAT PHOTO

07:04.224 --> 07:05.559
SAYS HE'S A PEDOPHILE.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.627
HE'S ALSO A MINOR,
OLIVIA.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.195
WHO'S OVER 16,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.697
AND WE DON'T
NEED A PARENT PRESENT

07:09.730 --> 07:10.764
TO QUESTION HIM.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.133
THE KID HAS ONLY ADMITTED
TO THINKING BAD THOUGHTS,

07:13.166 --> 07:14.234
AND THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.235
IT IS IF HE ACTED ON IT.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.939
WHAT IF HE HASN'T?

07:18.972 --> 07:21.509
THEN I WILL STOP HIM,
IF I CAN.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.749
[knock on door]

07:31.752 --> 07:33.020
DANA KELLEY?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.756
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHO'S HURT?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.990
I'M DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.125
CAN WE TALK INSIDE?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.496
UM, YES, OF COURSE.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.599
[cartoons on TV]

07:45.633 --> 07:46.700
[door closes]

07:46.734 --> 07:48.602
UH, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.904
YOUR STEPSON, CORY.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.840
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY CHANGES
IN HIS BEHAVIOR LATELY?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.508
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE WHAT?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.777
ANY SIGNS OF MOODINESS
OR TANTRUMS,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.546
NIGHTMARES,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.614
NO, NO MORE THAN USUAL.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.949
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY...
SIGNS OF HIM

08:01.982 --> 08:03.851
NOT WANTING
TO BE TOUCHED?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.622
OKAY, YOU ARE SCARING ME.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

08:08.656 --> 08:11.158
PLEASE JUST ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS IF YOU WOULD.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.192
IS CORY
ENROLLED IN SCHOOL?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.627
YES--KINDERGARTEN.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.928
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
FROM THE TEACHERS--

08:14.962 --> 08:15.929
ANY PROBLEMS THERE?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.297
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.967
THEY COMPLETELY
OVERREACTED

08:20.000 --> 08:22.002
WHEN CORY PLAYED DOCTOR
WITH A LITTLE GIRL

08:22.035 --> 08:23.571
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.539
KIDS ARE CURIOUS.
IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.608
IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE
MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.010
AND...SEXUAL ACTING OUT

08:30.043 --> 08:32.913
CAN...OFTEN BE
A SIGN OF ABUSE.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.018
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.087
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND NOW?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.924
MY HUSBAND IS, UM...

08:43.957 --> 08:45.993
DOWNTOWN,
PLUGGING POTHOLES.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.628
OKAY, HE'S GONNA NEED
TO MEET US AT THE HOSPITAL.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.630
UH, I DON'T--
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.832
WHO--WHO WOULD MAKE
THESE ACCUSATIONS?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.667
WHO IS TELLING YOU
THESE LIES?

08:53.701 --> 08:54.868
BECAUSE THEY ARE LIES.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.605
YOUR SON...ERIC.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.075
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?

09:02.109 --> 09:05.746
WE BELIEVE THAT HE'S
BEEN ABUSING CORY.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.585
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.654
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.722
I NEED TO SEARCH HIS ROOM.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.789
NO, WELL,
YOU CAN FORGET IT.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.290
BECAUSE I...

09:17.324 --> 09:19.059
WILL NOT COOPERATE
WITH YOU

09:19.092 --> 09:21.695
UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE TO ME
THAT MY SON HAS DONE THIS.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.164
WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW THAT
UNTIL AFTER THE MEDICAL EXAM.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.770
IS CORY ALL RIGHT?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.906
HE'S STILL
IN WITH DR. LAROM.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.643
IF I SEE ERIC AGAIN,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.644
THAT'S A PROMISE.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.078
CALM DOWN, MR. KELLEY.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.681
THREATENING YOUR STEPSON
ISN'T GONNA HELP CORY.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.616
ERIC DID NOT DO THIS.
I KNOW HE DIDN'T.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.284
THEN WHY
GO TO THE POLICE?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.986
BECAUSE HE IS LOST.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.688
HIS FATHER ABANDONED HIM,

09:47.721 --> 09:48.555
AND MAYBE HE THINKS
I DID TOO.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.390
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL, DANA.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.694
ONLY A TWISTED PERVERT
WOULD ADMIT TO ABUSING A CHILD.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.395
HE NEEDS OUR HELP, SEAN.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.165
YEAH, WELL, HE ISN'T
GONNA GET IT FROM ME.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.634
(woman)
DETECTIVE...

10:00.668 --> 10:03.637
THERE ARE NO OUTWARD SIGNS
OF PENETRATION.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.272
NO ANAL ABRASIONS,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.307
AND NO EVIDENCE
OF MUCOSAL TEARS.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.676
I DIDN'T FIND ANY SAP
IN HIS THROAT, EITHER.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.043
SAP?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.745
UH, SEMINAL ACID
PHOSPHATASE.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.313
OH, GOD.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.015
I HAD TO GIVE CORY
A SEDATIVE,

10:15.048 --> 10:16.984
SO HE'LL WANT TO SLEEP
WHEN YOU GET HIM HOME.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.055
I TOLD YOU ERIC
DIDN'T DO THIS.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.825
WE STILL DON'T KNOW THAT,
MRS. KELLEY.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.295
WHEN THERE IS AN ORAL
OR DIGITAL ASSAULT,

10:28.328 --> 10:31.164
IT DOESN'T LEAVE
ANY PHYSICAL MARKS.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.704
THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO TELL.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.740
I'M SORRY.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.119
HEY, HOW'D IT GO

10:52.152 --> 10:53.787
WITH THE BATTERED KID
AT ST. LUKE'S?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.355
D.C.S. PUT HIM
IN FOSTER CARE,

10:55.388 --> 10:56.356
MOTHER'S IN CUSTODY.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.225
ARRAIGNMENT'S TOMORROW.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.426
GREYLEK WORKS FAST.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.328
SO I HEARD YOUR WALK-IN'S
A PEDOPHILE.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.462
WELL, THE URGES ARE THERE,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.131
I'M JUST NOT SURE
ERIC'S ACTED ON THEM.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.733
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.774
DID YOU TALK
TO MY MOTHER?
YEAH.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.042
DOES SHE KNOW?
YEAH, SHE KNOWS.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.810
I-IS SHE COMING?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.779
NO, PROBABLY NOT
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.480
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE GET THE TRUTH.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.850
WHAT?
DON'T BE MAD
AT YOUR MOM.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.151
HEY, ERIC.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.753
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SEXUALLY ABUSED

11:25.786 --> 11:27.020
YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD
STEPBROTHER.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.722
BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.023
MM-HMM.
DID HE CRY?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.992
DID HE BEG YOU TO STOP?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.494
I CAME TO YOU
SO I WOULDN'T!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.797
WHY WON'T YOU
BELIEVE ME?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.497
IT STARTS WITH
THE FANTASIES...

11:37.530 --> 11:40.500
WHICH SCARED YOU AT FIRST.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.469
BUT THEN YOU STARTED
DRINKING.

11:42.502 --> 11:46.039
AND WHAT YOU WANTED
DIDN'T SEEM SO BAD AFTER ALL.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.743
[sobbing]
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.745
I KNOW IT'S WRONG.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.747
SO YOU STARTED
SURFING THE NET

11:53.781 --> 11:56.850
TO FIND PEOPLE
WHO UNDERSTAND.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.752
PEOPLE THAT WERE
JUST LIKE YOU, RIGHT, ERIC?

11:58.786 --> 12:00.287
DID YOU?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.421
(Olivia)
HMM?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.858
I FOUND A FEW.

12:04.892 --> 12:05.725
OKAY.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.795
AND DID YOU TRADE
PHOTOS OF LITTLE BOYS

12:07.828 --> 12:08.495
LIKE BASEBALL CARDS?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.863
NO.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.334
ONE GUY TOLD ME...

12:14.367 --> 12:16.770
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.440
THAT I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.508
(Stabler)
AND YOU NEEDED TO BELIEVE THAT.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.476
IT GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO ABUSE YOUR BROTHER.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.212
I DIDN'T.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.416
JAKE SAID...NOT TO.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.852
[sniffles]

12:31.885 --> 12:33.420
"LOOK, BUT NEVER TOUCH."

12:33.453 --> 12:34.221
WHO'S JAKE?

12:34.254 --> 12:39.426
HE RUNS A WEBSITE
CALLED PEDIAPHAX.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.063
HE SAID THAT YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH MY URGES.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.269
THE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST ISN'T
GETTING ANYWHERE WITH CORY,

12:49.302 --> 12:52.439
SO I'M CUTTING ERIC LOOSE.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.842
WELL...CAN'T WE
GET HIM INTO A PROGRAM?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.309
I MEAN, HE CLEARLY
WANTS TO GET HELP.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.911
THE ONLY PROGRAMS
OUT THERE

12:57.945 --> 13:00.347
ARE FOR REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDERS.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.215
SO HE CAME TO US
FOR HELP,

13:02.249 --> 13:04.852
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL HE RAPES A KID.

13:04.885 --> 13:09.056
THE WAY ERIC IS STRESSED,
THAT'S WHERE HE'S HEADED.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.825
(Munch)
PHOTOGRAPHIC STALKING
IN PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS,

13:11.859 --> 13:12.893
ARCADES, AND SCHOOLS.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.361
I DOUBT IF PARENTS KNOW

13:14.394 --> 13:16.363
THAT THEIR KIDS' PICTURES
ARE ON THE INTERNET.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.966
LET ALONE
A PEDOPHILE'S WEBSITE.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.901
THIS IS JAKE BERLIN, 57.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.070
WHITE MALE,
LIVES IN ALPHABET CITY.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.906
HE'S A MEDICAL SUPPLY
SALESMAN.

13:25.939 --> 13:26.606
SO MANAGING THE WEB SITE'S
A HOBBY?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.008
YEAH, AN ALL-CONSUMING ONE.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.944
HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF
A PEDOPHILE'S ADVOCATE.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.612
LIVES BY THE CODE,
"LOOK, BUT DON'T TOUCH."

13:32.645 --> 13:35.849
HE'S CONVINCED ERIC BYERS
THAT HE WAS BORN A PEDOPHILE.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.084
BERLIN EVEN
LISTS THE BEST PLACES

13:37.117 --> 13:39.419
FOR THE MISUNDERSTOOD PEDERAST
TO KIDDY WATCH.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.021
AND WE CAN'T
SHUT THIS SITE DOWN.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.389
(Munch)
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.291
KIDS AREN'T NUDE,
SO WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.159
(Olivia)
IS THERE ANY WAY TO IDENTIFY
WHO THESE KIDS ARE?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.627
(Fin)
LANDMARKS--WE COULD HAVE TARU

13:47.660 --> 13:49.262
BLOW UP THE PHOTOS
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

13:49.296 --> 13:51.398
AT LEAST LET THE PARENTS
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.867
I.D. THESE KIDS,
THEN TALK TO BERLIN.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.403
LET HIM KNOW
HE'S IN OUR CROSSHAIRS.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.008
(Jake)
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D GET HERE.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.943
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO THREATEN YOU.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.645
DID ERIC BYERS ADMIT
TO MOLESTING HIS STEPBROTHER?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.915
[watch beeping]
NO.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.383
AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.052
LIKE WHAT?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.987
OH, I GAVE HIM PHOTOS

14:14.021 --> 14:16.123
OF SWEET-CHEEKED
LITTLE BOYS...

14:16.156 --> 14:18.625
TO HOLD IN HIS
SWEATY FISTS.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.360
I DON'T GET THE APPEAL.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.661
I'M INTO LITTLE GIRLS.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.063
YOU'RE A STEAMING BAG
OF CRAP

14:23.096 --> 14:24.998
THAT I WOULD LOVE
TO SHOVE DOWN A HOLE.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.900
I'M NOT THE ENEMY.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.035
I LOOK, I DON'T TOUCH.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.202
SO YOU'RE A GOOD PEDOPHILE.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.904
I PREFER
THE TERM "PEDOSEXUAL."

14:30.938 --> 14:34.307
I SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT
CONTROLLING MY APPETITES.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.977
I CAN'T CHANGE WHO I AM.
I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.411
NO ONE'S BORN
A DEVIANT.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.947
[chuckles]

14:39.980 --> 14:42.515
HOMOSEXUALS
WERE CALLED DEVIANTS.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.151
AND NOW IT'S WIDELY ACCEPTED
THAT THEIR ORIENTATION

14:44.184 --> 14:46.353
WAS HARDWIRED AT BIRTH.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.487
JUST LIKE MINE.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.422
I WASN'T ABUSED
AS A CHILD.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.491
I MEAN, I DON'T CHOOSE
TO LOVE LITTLE GIRLS

14:51.524 --> 14:53.226
ANY MORE THAN THEY CHOOSE
TO LOVE THE SAME GENDER

14:53.260 --> 14:54.928
OR YOU CHOOSE TO LOVE WOMEN.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.965
GAY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SEX
WITH CHILDREN.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.301
NEITHER DO I.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.470
I ADMIT I LIKE
DELICIOUS LITTLE ANGELS

15:03.503 --> 15:05.038
AGES THREE TO NINE.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.274
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
EXCEPT KEEP MY DISTANCE,

15:07.307 --> 15:09.042
SINCE THEY CAN'T
LEGALLY CONSENT.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.012
YOUR WEB SITE IS LIKE
A KIDDY TREASURE MAP.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.181
WHAT HAPPENS IF OTHER PREDATORS
DON'T FOLLOW YOUR RULES?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.682
THEY SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.018
(Stabler)
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

15:18.051 --> 15:20.988
WELL, A SEXUALLY SATISFIED
PEDOPHILE LOVES TO SHARE.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.722
AND SINCE THERE'S NO
ANONYMITY ON MY WEB SITE,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.691
BELIEVE ME, I'D KNOW.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.159
AND I HAVE...

15:26.193 --> 15:27.394
[cell phone ringing]

15:27.427 --> 15:29.262
NAMES, ADDRESSES.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.998
BENSON.
I TAKE THE LAW
VERY SERIOUSLY.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.233
SO DO I.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.173
I MEAN, I CAN TELL...
YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.042
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
FAMILY PHOTOS?

15:45.612 --> 15:48.148
I PROMISE NOT TO DROOL.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.651
ELLIOT.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.353
THAT WAS GREYLEK.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.022
CORY KELLEY JUST ADMITTED

15:55.055 --> 15:57.057
TO BEING MOLESTED
BY HIS STEPBROTHER.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.058
LET'S GO PICK HIM UP.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.359
ONLY IF WE CAN FIND HIM.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.095
MOTHER CLAIMS SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.109
IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR SON IS,
YOU NEED TO TELL US.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.410
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
YOU'RE LYING.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.047
I DON'T KNOW WHERE ERIC IS,
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.115
I CAN'T STAND THIS,
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.716
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.585
WHAT'D YOU DO TO TURN YOUR KID
INTO SUCH A FREAK?

16:25.618 --> 16:26.753
I'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT LOVE HIM.

16:26.786 --> 16:27.787
LOVE HIM?
HOW?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.490
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABUSED KIDS
TURN INTO ABUSERS.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.259
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU SHUT UP!

16:32.292 --> 16:33.793
I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR
YOU SAY THAT--SHUT UP!

16:33.826 --> 16:37.330
I DON'T WANT YOU
NEAR MY SON--GET OUT!

16:37.364 --> 16:40.400
DETECTIVES...
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.804
I SPRAYED THE BATHROOM
WITH LUMINAL.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.140
MM-HMM, LET ME GUESS:
YOU FOUND SEMEN.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.543
LAUNDRY'S COVERED IN IT.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.245
TRANSFER
FROM A KID'S T-SHIRT.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.148
FAST BLUE B GOES PURPLE
WHEN IT HITS SAP.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.149
CAN YOU RUSH THE DNA?

16:56.183 --> 16:58.085
TOP OF THE PILE.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.155
(man)
WHAT DID YOUR BROTHER DO NEXT?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.022
SHOW ME ON THE DOLL.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.094
(Greylek)
ANY SIGNS OF ERIK BYERS?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.661
(Stabler)
CITYWIDE ALERT
WENT OUT LAST NIGHT.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.597
KID'S GONE.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.232
HE'S A MINOR
WITH NO MONEY.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.500
HOW'D HE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT HELP?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.068
WELL, WE QUESTIONED
HIS MOTHER.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.270
HER WORLD
IS FALLING APART.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.771
ENOUGH TO THROW
HER KID TO THE WOLVES?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.241
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO MAKE IT TO TRIAL.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.843
DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF,
DR. ENGELS.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.446
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS IF
THE BOY CAN TAKE THE STAND.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.614
FOR ONE THING,
HE'S TOO YOUNG

17:27.647 --> 17:28.815
TO TESTIFY
IN A COURTROOM.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.550
WE CAN VIDEOTAPE
HIS TESTIMONY.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.220
AND...HE WAS COACHED.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.123
HE JUST SHOVED A CRAYON
INTO A DOLL'S ASS.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.091
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TO HIS RECTUM.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.160
SOMEBODY TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO
TO RAISE THE ALARM.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.195
HOW MUCH TIME
DID YOU SPEND WITH CORY?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.396
MEANING?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.464
MEANING YOU SEEM
PRETTY ANXIOUS

17:44.497 --> 17:45.765
TO GET INTO
THAT COURTROOM.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.634
I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE
IMPLYING, DETECTIVE.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.102
I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO THE BOY YET.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.337
YOU TALKED WITH HIS FATHER.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.404
THAT'S MY JOB.
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.473
I BELIEVE THE VICTIM.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.541
WHY DON'T YOU?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.408
BECAUSE ERIC BYERS

17:55.442 --> 17:58.111
WALKED INTO OUR PRECINCT
ASKING FOR HELP.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.812
HE SAYS THAT HE DIDN'T
TOUCH HIM.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.115
WHICH IS WHAT
ALL PEDOPHILES SAY.

18:02.149 --> 18:05.185
IN YOUR OPINION, WAS CORY KELLEY
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.819
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT
WITH ANY CERTAINTY.

18:06.853 --> 18:07.687
WELL, I CAN.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.389
ARE YOU EVEN INTERESTED
IN JUSTICE,

18:09.422 --> 18:10.557
OR JUST SHOWBOATING?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.858
JUST DO YOUR DAMN JOB,
AND I'LL DO MINE.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.360
WELL, IS THERE SOMETHING

18:13.393 --> 18:14.861
YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING
THAT WE'RE NOT?

18:14.894 --> 18:15.862
YEAH...

18:15.895 --> 18:17.497
SQUEEZE THE PEDOPHILE'S
MOTHER

18:17.530 --> 18:19.466
TILL SHE POPS.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.202
NO HITS
ON DANA KELLEY'S LUDS

18:22.235 --> 18:23.536
FOR HER CELL
OR HOME PHONE.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.705
NO LARGE WITHDRAWALS
FROM HER BANK.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.174
MAYBE SHE'S RENTING
HIM THE APARTMENT,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.107
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S
RUNNING HER CREDIT.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.243
WELL, HER MARRIAGE
JUST TOOK A NOSE DIVE.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.544
SHE'S LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO STAY.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.513
YOU THINK JAKE BERLIN
HELPED ERIC GIVE US THE SLIP?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.248
NO, BUT I RAN HIM
ANYWAY.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.317
SORRY TO SAY
HE CAME UP CLEAN.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.318
YOU CHECK OUT
ERIC'S LAPTOP,

18:38.351 --> 18:40.320
FRIENDS, INSTANT MESSAGES,

18:40.353 --> 18:41.488
THE ADDRESS BOOK.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.355
HE'S A TEXTBOOK LOANER.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.224
SEARCH HISTORY TURNED UP
ANOTHER WEBSITE

18:44.257 --> 18:45.925
WITH KIDS IN VARIOUS STAGES
OF UNDRESS.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.760
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
THAT'S FEDERAL TIME.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.929
(Munch)
GREYLEK ALREADY NOTIFIED
THE F.B.I.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.598
AND ADDED THAT CHARGE
TO THE INDICTMENT.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.266
SHE'S MAKING SURE
HE'S GOING TO PRISON.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.734
SOUNDS LIKE
THAT'S WHERE HE BELONGS.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.769
BERLIN JUST UPLOADED
A FRESH BATCH OF KIDS

18:56.803 --> 18:57.904
TO THE SITE.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.217
DNA CAME BACK FROM THE SEMEN
FOUND ON THAT KID'S T-SHIRT.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.751
DOESN'T MATCH YOUR SUSPECT.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.286
WHO DOES IT BELONG TO?

19:13.320 --> 19:15.255
KID'S FATHER--
SEAN KELLEY.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.491
JOHN, GO WITH LIV
AND TALK TO THIS HUMP.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.726
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.793
CAPTAIN HAS ME
GLUED TO THIS MONITOR

19:20.827 --> 19:22.729
I.D.ing KIDS
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.945
[beeping]

19:38.978 --> 19:39.946
HEY!

19:39.979 --> 19:41.448
HEY!
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

19:41.481 --> 19:42.482
TRY IT AND I'LL SMACK YOU.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.683
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

19:43.716 --> 19:46.553
(Benson)
RECOGNIZE THIS?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.721
YEAH, IT'S MY SON'S SHIRT.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.223
SEE THAT PURPLE STAIN?

19:50.257 --> 19:53.226
THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
TO SEMEN.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.227
I'LL KILL HIM.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.228
WELL, THEN,
KILL YOURSELF,

19:55.262 --> 19:57.196
BECAUSE DNA PROVES THAT
THE SEMEN CAME FROM YOU.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.004
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.739
SURE IT IS.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.376
UNLESS YOU CAN EXPLAIN
HOW YOUR JUNK GOT IN THAT SHIRT.

20:09.409 --> 20:13.280
YOU'RE GONNA BE SITTING
IN A CELL FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.981
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.552
WHEN ERIC STARTED DRINKING,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.754
HE WENT FROM BEING A PROBLEM
TO A NIGHTMARE.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.623
MY WIFE BLAMED ME.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.558
IT KILLED OUR MARRIAGE,

20:25.592 --> 20:26.859
ALONG WITH IT,
OUR SEX LIFE.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.431
DON'T TELL ME YOU NEVER
SELF-SERVED.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.732
NOT IN MY SON'S SHIRT.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.933
THE BATHROOM'S
THE ONLY PLACE

20:33.966 --> 20:35.034
FOR PRIVACY.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.004
A HAMPER WAS THERE,
THE DIRTY CLOTHES WERE IN IT.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.906
YOU DONE
RUBBIN' MY NOSE IN IT?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.508
CAN I GET BACK TO WORK?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.288
UHH!

20:58.057 --> 20:59.592
CAPTAIN,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.594
WE GOT A BIG PROBLEM.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.530
THAT'S ONE OF THE KIDS
FROM THE WEBSITE?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.064
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HER
AT FIRST.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.399
WHO IS SHE?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.368
IT'S STABLER'S DAUGHTER,
ELIZABETH.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.003
SHE'S 15 NOW.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.405
ELLIOT SEE THIS?

21:12.439 --> 21:13.740
YEAH, HE SUDDENLY
HAD AN ERRAND TO RUN.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.643
MOVE YOUR ASS, MUNCH.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.345
CALL OLIVIA AND FIN.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.457
[buzzing]

21:30.490 --> 21:31.524
ELLIOT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:31.558 --> 21:33.360
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

21:33.393 --> 21:35.362
[buzzing]

21:35.395 --> 21:36.496
AT LEAST HE'S STILL BREATHING.
GET UP!

21:36.529 --> 21:38.565
HE BROKE IN!

21:38.598 --> 21:39.899
HE--HE BEAT ME UP!

21:39.932 --> 21:40.700
TRIED TO KILL ME.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.934
A LITTLE PLASTIC.
A FEW SHOVELS.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.969
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA TO ME.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.103
THIS DOES NOT
LOOK GOOD, EL.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.104
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.039
I WANT HER PHOTO
OFF THIS SITE.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.777
GET AWAY FROM THAT DESK.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.345
NOT UNTIL I GET
WHAT I CAME FOR!

21:52.379 --> 21:54.347
NOW, DETECTIVE!

21:54.381 --> 21:57.450
GET HIM OVER HERE.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.318
DELETE IT, PRICK.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.428
[punching keys]

22:08.461 --> 22:10.497
[bleeping]

22:11.864 --> 22:13.900
[bleeping]

22:13.933 --> 22:15.334
[beep]

22:18.405 --> 22:19.706
I WA--I WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.740
I WANT THAT MAN ARRESTED.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.775
IN HANDCUFFS
RIGHT NOW.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.136
ANY LAST WORDS?

22:53.773 --> 22:55.808
I FIGURED YOU'D BE
DOING MOST OF THE TALKING.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.177
BERLIN PROVOKED YOU.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.480
HE USED YOUR FAMILY
TO PISS YOU OFF ENOUGH

23:00.513 --> 23:01.448
TO GO AFTER HIM.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.883
IT WAS A SETUP.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.886
IT'S A REASON,
NOT AN EXCUSE.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.788
AND SO, FOR NOW,

23:08.821 --> 23:11.524
I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.496
YOU'RE ON UNPAID LEAVE
STARTING TODAY.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.035
FOR HOW LONG?

23:23.069 --> 23:25.638
UNTIL ALL HIS BRUISES
ARE GONE.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.409
AND YOURS TOO.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.147
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.817
I'M NOT DONE, DETECTIVE.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.526
THREE STAND-UP COPS

23:46.559 --> 23:49.228
PUT THEIR CAREERS AND PENSIONS
ON THE LINE FOR YOU.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.064
YOU MIGHT WANNA
CONSIDER THAT

23:52.098 --> 23:54.734
NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE
TO BE A SELFISH SON OF A BITCH

23:54.767 --> 23:56.703
AND GO OFF HALF-COCKED.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.573
HAVE YOU LOCATED
ERIC BYERS?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.707
(Munch)
NO.

24:34.741 --> 24:35.908
ARE YOU EVEN TRYING?

24:35.942 --> 24:37.844
YOU CAN LOOK FOR HIM
YOURSELF.

24:37.877 --> 24:38.878
IT'S NOT MY JOB.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.581
(Fin)
SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.716
SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.718
I'VE BEEN DISMISSED,
OVERLOOKED, AND IGNORED.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.554
I DESERVE TO BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.589
I WOULDN'T HAVE CALLED YOU
IF I DIDN'T.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.562
MY GUT SAYS THAT ERIC BYERS
DIDN'T MOLEST HIS STEPBROTHER.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.629
AND I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

24:56.663 --> 24:58.230
WITH HIM BEING RAILROADED
INTO PRISON

24:58.264 --> 24:59.699
FOR SOMETHING
THAT HE DIDN'T DO.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.634
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS,
OLIVIA.

25:01.668 --> 25:02.535
THE LITTLE BOY
SAID HE DID.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.603
AFTER BEING COACHED

25:03.636 --> 25:06.205
BY A MAN WHO'S OBSESSED
WITH REVENGE.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.306
THAT'S A LEAP.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.340
(Fin)
YOU'RE TAKING A RISK

25:08.374 --> 25:10.042
GOING TO TRIAL
WITH A FIVE-YEAR-OLD WITNESS

25:10.076 --> 25:11.578
AND NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.013
I'VE GOT THE CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY FROM ERIC'S LAPTOP.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.615
WON'T TAKE A JURY
LONG AT ALL.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.950
IF ERIC HAD TOUCHED CORY,

25:17.984 --> 25:19.886
THERE WOULD BE MORE SIGNS
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.622
YOU SAW WHAT CORY KELLEY
DID TO THAT DOLL.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.422
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

25:23.455 --> 25:25.658
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A RECTAL EXAM?

25:27.727 --> 25:28.828
SAY YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.663
WHY WOULD SEAN KELLEY
GO TO THE TROUBLE.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.665
TO GET A PEDOPHILE
OUT OF HIS HOME.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.300
IF ERIC HASN'T
MOLESTED A KID YET,

25:34.333 --> 25:35.334
HE WILL.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.636
BASTARDS CAN'T
HELP THEMSELVES.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.204
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.639
DROP THE ABUSE CHARGE.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.273
GET ERIC TO PLEAD OUT

25:41.307 --> 25:43.075
ON POSSESSION OF CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.144
THAT WAY, ERIC IS LOCKED UP
AND IN A PROGRAM.

25:45.177 --> 25:48.014
PROGRAMS DON'T WORK,
OLIVIA.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.316
NEITHER DOES DEPO PROVERA,
OR SURGICAL CASTRATION.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.884
THE URGES REMAIN.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.052
WELL, WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.954
AND PRISON REHAB
IS ALL WE HAVE,

25:54.987 --> 25:56.255
UNTIL SHRINKS FIND A WAY

25:56.288 --> 25:58.691
TO GET THEM
TO SUPPRESS THEIR DESIRES.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.627
I DON'T LIKE IT.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.831
THIS IS OUR BEST SHOT
TO GET ERIC OFF THE STREET

26:04.864 --> 26:07.634
BEFORE HE REALLY
HURTS SOMEONE.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.337
I'LL CALL THE FEDS.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.172
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.778
NONE OF THIS MATTERS
UNLESS YOU FIND HIM.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.315
THAT'S WHAT
I'M COUNTING ON.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.151
[rattling]

26:25.184 --> 26:27.153
KNOW WHERE HE IS?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.022
THE DEAL
IS TIME-SENSITIVE, DANA.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.391
ERIC NEEDS
TO TURN HIMSELF IN.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.325
HE HASN'T CALLED.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.828
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN TO LOOK.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.798
OKAY, IF WE FIND OUT
THAT YOU KNEW HIS WHEREABOUTS,

26:38.831 --> 26:41.267
YOU COULD BE CHARGED
WITH OBSTRUCTION

26:41.300 --> 26:42.669
AND ACCESSORY YOURSELF.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.136
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

26:44.170 --> 26:45.772
CORY WAS ABUSED,
AND ALL YOU CARE ABOUT

26:45.805 --> 26:47.339
IS HIS ABUSER.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.274
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

26:48.307 --> 26:51.077
3 TO 15 YEARS
IN FEDERAL LOCKUP, MR. KELLEY.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.211
IT'S NOT
A WALK IN THE PARK.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.946
OH, I DIDN'T AGREE
TO ANY DEALS.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.848
THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD
BE WORRIED ABOUT IS MY SON.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.685
THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION
FOR EVERYONE.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.119
ERIC GOES TO PRISON,

27:00.152 --> 27:02.655
AND CORY DOESN'T HAVE TO FACE
THE TRAUMA OF A TRIAL.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.290
OR DON'T YOU
CARE ABOUT THAT?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.097
[door slams]

27:15.067 --> 27:18.137
SEAN USED TO BE, UH...

27:18.170 --> 27:21.674
COMPASSIONATE
AND FORGIVING.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.410
I GUESS THAT WAS--
THAT WAS MY FAULT TOO.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.113
NO, IT ISN'T.

27:29.381 --> 27:33.085
MY SON IS...

27:33.119 --> 27:36.923
SEXUALLY STIMULATED
BY CHILDREN.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.460
I, UH, I...

27:41.493 --> 27:45.264
I-I-I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT,
CAN YOU?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.202
NO.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.706
I KEEP GOING...

27:53.740 --> 27:55.307
OVER AND OVER THE...

27:55.341 --> 27:58.010
THE PAST IN MY MIND,
AND I...

28:01.380 --> 28:03.883
WHAT DID I...

28:03.916 --> 28:06.452
WHAT DID I SAY?

28:06.485 --> 28:09.989
WHAT DID I DO
OR WHAT DIDN'T I DO?

28:14.393 --> 28:16.428
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.765
DANA, YOU DIDN'T MAKE
YOUR SON A PEDOPHILE.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.803
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.277
I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THIS WORLD.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.012
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.253
IF YOU HEAR
FROM ERIC, UH...

28:41.287 --> 28:43.856
I NEED YOU TO CALL ME.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.728
[door closes]

28:58.404 --> 29:00.239
(Olivia)
HEY.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.842
LOOKS LIKE A ROUGH NIGHT.
ANY MOVEMENT?

29:02.875 --> 29:05.111
NOTHING.
GUESS I WAS WRONG.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.413
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD
LEAD US STRAIGHT TO HIM.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.115
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
BEING CAREFUL.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.850
SHE'S AN EMOTIONAL WRECK,
FIN.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.985
PEOPLE LIKE THAT
DON'T THINK--THEY ACT.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.821
LIKE YOUR PARTNER.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.361
ELLIOT TOLD ME
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.495
HE SAYS THAT HE
TRUSTS YOU, SO...

29:23.529 --> 29:25.798
WELL, THIS TIME,
HE SHOULD.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.133
I DON'T KNOW
HOW HE DID IT,

29:27.166 --> 29:29.235
BUT THE MAN
SHOWED RESTRAINT.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.372
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:33.405 --> 29:35.307
YOU KNOW THAT BASTARDS
LIKE BERLIN

29:35.341 --> 29:37.309
GET OFF ON LITTLE KIDS.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.178
AND YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO

29:39.211 --> 29:41.547
WHEN THEY'RE HAVING
THEIR LITTLE FANTASIES.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.883
IF THAT WAS MY KID,

29:43.916 --> 29:45.051
I WOULD HAVE DONE HIM.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.191
THERE SHE IS.

29:52.224 --> 29:55.094
(Fin)
THINK SHE'S MOVING THIS EARLY?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.162
(Benson)
ONLY ONE BOX?

29:56.195 --> 29:58.898
SHE'S GOTTA BE
MAKING A DELIVERY.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.900
[car engine starts]

30:33.432 --> 30:36.903
[Dana screaming]

30:36.936 --> 30:40.406
NO! NO! NO! NO!

30:40.439 --> 30:43.175
[sobbing]

30:48.981 --> 30:50.917
OH, MY BABY!

30:50.950 --> 30:53.119
OHH...MY BABY.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.923
[sobbing]

30:56.956 --> 30:59.325
NO! NO, NO.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.893
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.494
COME ON.
LET HIM GO, DANA.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.530
(Dana)
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, PLEASE.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.631
(Fin)
HE'S DEAD.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.366
I CAN'T LET YOU
TOUCH HIM.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.635
[sobbing]

31:09.668 --> 31:10.869
SOON AS YOU CALM DOWN.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.575
I'M SORRY!

31:19.111 --> 31:20.679
I'M SO SORRY.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.182
I CAN'T--
I DID THIS.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.251
I KILLED HIM.
I KILLED MY SON!

31:25.284 --> 31:35.327
I KILLED...

31:35.327 --> 31:45.037
I KILLED...

31:45.071 --> 31:48.074
[sirens
and police radio chatter]

31:55.347 --> 31:58.150
DANA, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE HE WAS HIDING?

32:02.321 --> 32:05.224
I DIDN'T KNOW
UNTIL LAST NIGHT.

32:05.257 --> 32:09.095
HE CALLED...
LEFT A MESSAGE...

32:09.128 --> 32:13.265
WANTING ME TO COME
PICK HIM UP.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.967
I WAS GOING
TO BRING HIM TO YOU.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.969
SURE.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.471
WITH A BOX
OF HIS STUFF.

32:19.505 --> 32:23.475
I FOUND PHOTOS
OF MORE KIDS.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.278
EVIDENCE...

32:26.312 --> 32:27.579
FOR YOU TO GIVE HIM
MORE TIME.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.982
I NEVER...

32:30.016 --> 32:32.151
NEVER WANTED
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.655
WHERE DID HE GET THE MONEY
FOR THIS PLACE?

32:38.357 --> 32:39.491
I DON'T KNOW.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.462
DANA...

32:43.495 --> 32:45.364
DID YOU RENT IT FOR HIM?

32:45.397 --> 32:48.034
NO, I TOLD YOU, I...

32:48.067 --> 32:50.636
THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY.

32:50.669 --> 32:54.040
'CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
ERIC DIDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.741
HE HAD YOU.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.743
HE CALLED AND LEFT
A MESSAGE ON VOICEMAIL,

32:57.776 --> 33:00.112
SAYING HE WANTED
TO COME HOME.

33:00.146 --> 33:03.749
AND...I CALLED HIM BACK,
AND SAID...

33:06.785 --> 33:09.188
AND SAID I'D HAD ENOUGH.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.393
AND THAT HE WAS ON HIS OWN.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.395
YOU TURNED HIM AWAY
EMPTY-HANDED.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.030
NO, I GAVE HIM $300.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.199
I GAVE HIM $300.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.470
IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
CHECKS OUT,

33:24.503 --> 33:26.505
THEN YOU PROBABLY
WON'T BE CHARGED.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.048
I LOVED HIM!

33:36.082 --> 33:38.384
I LOVED HIM.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.752
[sobbing]

33:43.322 --> 33:45.124
I LOVED HIM.

33:45.157 --> 33:48.160
AND I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.433
IS THE SCANSTATION
ALMOST DONE?

33:54.466 --> 33:56.502
TRIANGULATION
TAKES TIME, DOC.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.803
HEY, I'M NOT
COMPLAINING.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.239
THAT MACHINE
CREATES MY COURT EXHIBITS.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.673
AND HE'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.809
ALL CLEAR.

34:03.842 --> 34:07.313
FROM THE BLOOD VOLUME
ON THE WALLS AND FLOOR,

34:07.346 --> 34:10.482
C.O.D. IS PROBABLY
GOING TO BE EXSANGUINATION.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.084
YOU FIND
A MURDER WEAPON?

34:12.118 --> 34:13.685
THESE CHEAP KNIVES
WERE IN THE KITCHEN.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.488
IT TOOK SEVEN BLADES
TO FINISH HIM OFF

34:16.522 --> 34:17.589
'CAUSE THEY KEPT SNAPPING.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.726
I COUNT AT LEAST
A DOZEN STAB WOUNDS.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.860
THAT'S A LOT OF RAGE.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.595
THE KILLER
HAD TO CUT HIMSELF.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.531
THAT'S WHY I'M HOPING
ALL THIS BLOOD ISN'T ERIC'S.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.533
THEY SAID
HE WAS SCREAMING.

34:27.566 --> 34:28.834
SOMEONE FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
CAME FORWARD AS A WITNESS?

34:28.867 --> 34:31.370
THE VICTIM
DIALED 9-1-1.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.838
DISPOSABLE CELL.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.573
COULDN'T PINPOINT
HIS LOCATION,

34:34.606 --> 34:36.642
BUT WE'RE GETTING
THE TAPE.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.245
[Eric screaming on tape]

34:40.879 --> 34:43.282
HELP! HELP!

34:43.315 --> 34:44.783
NO! NO!

34:44.816 --> 34:46.185
NO! NO!

34:46.218 --> 34:47.886
PLEASE! PLEASE!
PLEASE, I'M SORRY!

34:47.919 --> 34:49.255
AGH! AAH!

34:49.288 --> 34:51.657
OHH! HELP!

34:51.690 --> 34:54.226
HELP! AGH! AAH!

34:54.260 --> 34:56.562
OHH! OHH!
[tape shuts off]

34:56.595 --> 34:59.231
THE UNIT WAS FURNISHED,
AND THE KNIVES WERE CHEAP,

34:59.265 --> 35:01.267
SO ERIC PROBABLY MANAGED
TO CALL 9-1-1

35:01.300 --> 35:02.668
AFTER THE FIRST BLADE BROKE

35:02.701 --> 35:04.336
AND THE KILLER
WENT TO GET ANOTHER.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.837
HOW LONG IS THE TAPE?

35:05.871 --> 35:06.838
ABOUT FOUR MINUTES.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.741
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH
HOW THIS WENT DOWN?

35:13.212 --> 35:15.381
ARTERIAL BURSTS
BY THE KITCHEN WALL

35:15.414 --> 35:18.484
SHOW THAT THE ATTACK
STARTED HERE.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.785
NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY,

35:19.818 --> 35:21.753
SO ERIC HAD TO KNOW
THE KILLER.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.155
THESE VOID AREAS SHOW

35:23.189 --> 35:24.590
WHERE THE KILLER STOOD
TO STAB THE VICTIM

35:24.623 --> 35:26.192
AND GOT COVERED
IN HIS BLOOD.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.893
THE BLOOD SPATTER
LEADS OUT TO THE STREET.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.595
WE'RE HOPING THE BLOOD
BELONGS TO THE PERP.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.729
I NOTIFIED THE HOSPITALS

35:30.762 --> 35:31.863
TO CALL US
WITH ANY KNIFE WOUNDS.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.267
WELL, THAT MUCH BLOOD
MEANS TRANSFER TO HIMSELF,

35:35.301 --> 35:36.335
HIS VEHICLE, HIS HOME.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.937
THERE IS NO WAY THAT SEAN KELLEY
CLEANED IT ALL UP.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.773
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT WAS ERIC'S STEPFATHER?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.209
HE REPEATEDLY
THREATENED HIS LIFE

35:43.242 --> 35:45.511
AND WAS FURIOUS
WHEN WE OFFERED ERIC A DEAL.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.745
HOW DID KELLEY KNOW
WHERE ERIC WAS STAYING

35:46.778 --> 35:48.480
WHEN EVEN HIS OWN MOTHER
DIDN'T KNOW?

35:50.316 --> 35:51.917
BECAUSE HE LEFT
A MESSAGE AT HOME

35:51.950 --> 35:53.385
WANTING HIS MOTHER
TO PICK HIM UP.

35:53.419 --> 35:54.753
HE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HIS PARENTS HAD SPLIT.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.588
THAT DOESN'T PROVE
KELLEY HEARD THE MESSAGE.

35:56.622 --> 35:57.756
WE'VE GOTTEN WARRANTS
WITH LESS.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.857
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER,

35:58.890 --> 36:00.259
SINCE CASEY NOVAK

36:00.292 --> 36:02.294
LIED TO A JUDGE
AND GOT DISBARRED.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.331
CALL ME WHEN YOU PUT
KELLEY AT THE CRIME SCENE

36:05.364 --> 36:07.799
AND I'LL WALK IT THROUGH
MYSELF.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.472
18 STAB WOUNDS

36:13.505 --> 36:16.275
TO HIS BACK, CHEST,
NECK, AND ARMS.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.577
THE FATAL BLOW
WAS A NICKED CAROTID.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.246
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST STRIKE,

36:20.279 --> 36:22.281
SINCE IT TOOK HIM
FOUR MINUTES TO DIE.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.483
I COUNT AT LEAST THREE
POST-MORTEM THRUSTS.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.385
BASED ON THE WOUND TRACKS,

36:26.418 --> 36:27.519
YOUR KILLER IS ABOUT
SIX FEET TALL

36:27.553 --> 36:28.954
AND RIGHT-HANDED.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.656
THAT MATCHES SEAN KELLEY.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.592
AND ABOUT TWO MILLION
OTHER GUYS IN THE CITY.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.529
THE VICTIM WAS ALSO SODOMIZED
WITH A FOREIGN OBJECT.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.331
I REMOVED THESE SPLINTERS.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.733
CSU IDENTIFIED
AS NORTHERN WHITE ASH.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.270
WHITE ASH.
I'M THINKING BASEBALL BAT.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.572
BUT THEY'RE USUALLY
MILLED AND CODED.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.974
NOT IF THEY'RE HOMEMADE.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.279
(Benson)
I WOULDN'T.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.247
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT'S BEEN.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.751
YOUR CLIENT
SODOMIZED HIS STEPSON

36:59.785 --> 37:03.622
WITH HIS FIVE-YEAR-OLD'S
HOMEMADE BASEBALL BAT.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.891
AND THEN HE STABBED
ERIC BYERS TO DEATH

37:05.924 --> 37:07.759
AND LEFT HIM IN A POOL
OF HIS OWN BLOOD.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.428
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.
SURE YOU DID!

37:09.461 --> 37:10.496
BECAUSE HE HAD TO PAY
FOR THE FACT

37:10.529 --> 37:11.530
THAT HE WAS
A PEDOPHILE.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.332
HE MOLESTED MY SON.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.000
TELL THAT TO YOURSELF
WHILE YOU'RE ROTTING IN PRISON.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.435
YOU SAID BEFORE
YOU COULDN'T BE SURE

37:16.468 --> 37:17.636
ERIC ABUSED CORY.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.670
NOW YOU'RE SAYING
HE DIDN'T?

37:18.704 --> 37:20.005
YOUR SON
DOESN'T REACT

37:20.038 --> 37:21.273
LIKE A VICTIM OF ABUSE

37:21.307 --> 37:22.308
BECAUSE HE'S
NEVER BEEN TOUCHED.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.815
THE BASTARD DESERVED
WORSE THAN HE GOT.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.451
HE NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT IT
FELT LIKE TO BE VIOLATED.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.386
HE COULD DISH IT OUT,
BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE IT!

37:34.420 --> 37:35.454
BUT YOU COULDN'T
STOP THERE,

37:35.487 --> 37:36.655
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU TOOK HIS LIFE.

37:36.688 --> 37:41.360
ANYONE WHO RAPES LITTLE KIDS
SHOULD BE WIPED OFF THE PLANET.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.531
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.434
I LEFT HIM CRYING,
BUT ALIVE.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.408
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING?

37:56.442 --> 37:57.876
AFTER THAT PERFORMANCE,

37:57.909 --> 37:58.677
NOTHING.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.579
WELL, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO RECONSIDER.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.614
THE JURY POOL
IS FULL OF PARENTS.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.982
A BOY IS DEAD.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.784
NOT MY CLIENT'S PROBLEM.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.952
HE JUST SAID
HE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.554
ALTHOUGH HE CLEARLY
HAD REASON TO.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.722
NOTHING JUSTIFIES
PREMEDITATED MURDER.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.624
WELL, I WOULDN'T USE
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION

38:12.658 --> 38:16.828
IN YOUR CLOSING ARGUMENTS
FOR A PEDOPHILE, COUNSELOR.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.830
YOU'LL LOSE.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.335
OLIVIA,
KELLEY GO THE DISTANCE?

38:23.369 --> 38:24.403
I GOT HIM ON SODOMY.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.071
HE CLAIMS THAT HE
DIDN'T MURDER ERIC.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.706
LOOKS LIKE HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.608
DIDN'T FIND ANY BLOOD
IN HIS TRUCK OR HIS HOME.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.910
EVEN HIS WORK BOOTS
DON'T MATCH THE PRINTS

38:31.943 --> 38:32.744
FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.746
I HEARD YOU HAD
A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.748
HE WON'T COP TO THE MURDER.
WHY?

38:36.782 --> 38:38.450
I FOUND BLOOD
IN THE CORRIDOR

38:38.484 --> 38:39.885
THAT DOESN'T
BELONG TO THE VICTIM.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.720
WELL, LET'S SWAB KELLEY
AND SEE IF THE DNA'S A MATCH.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.356
DON'T BOTHER,
UNLESS HE'S A DIABETIC.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.458
HOW DO YOU KNOW
OUR KILLER'S A DIABETIC?

38:46.492 --> 38:48.427
I RAN THE BLOOD
FOR DNA...

38:48.460 --> 38:50.462
AND THE HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS
WERE SO HIGH,

38:50.496 --> 38:51.963
I RAN AN A1C TEST.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.132
EITHER THE KILLER
DOESN'T KNOW HE'S DIABETIC

38:54.165 --> 38:55.667
OR HE'S NOT TAKING
ENOUGH INSULIN.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.104
JAKE BERLIN'S A DIABETIC.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.539
GET HIS BLOOD,
AND I'LL COMPARE IT

39:00.572 --> 39:02.107
TO THE SAMPLE
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.576
I THOUGHT BERLIN
WAS ERIC'S MENTOR.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.445
THAT'S WHAT ERIC BELIEVED.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.679
THEN WHY KILL HIM?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.381
PULL UP THE PEDIAPHAX
WEBSITE

39:09.415 --> 39:11.850
AND LET'S CHECK THE CHATTER.

39:11.883 --> 39:12.818
[typing]

39:12.851 --> 39:15.387
ERIC DID A KID,
THEN CONFESSED ON THE WEBSITE.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.187
HE SNAPPED.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.723
AFTER ALL THE PRESSURE
WITH CORY,

39:17.756 --> 39:19.458
HE NEEDED AN OUTLET.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.894
THE PROBLEM IS ERIC DIDN'T
REVEAL HIS VICTIM'S NAME.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.166
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR MURDER, MR. BERLIN.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.835
MY WEBSITE, MY RULES.

39:29.868 --> 39:30.936
I SAID THERE'D BE
CONSEQUENCES.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.938
YEAH, LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.106
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU MAY THINK,

39:35.140 --> 39:36.675
YOU ARE NOT A HERO.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.043
OR COURSE I AM.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.679
I'M A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW
PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE TO LIVE.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.414
I DID WHAT THE SUPREME COURT
REFUSED TO DO.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.750
I MADE RAPING A CHILD
A CAPITOL OFFENSE.

39:44.783 --> 39:45.984
A LIFE FOR A LIFE.

39:46.017 --> 39:46.885
DID HE MURDER THE BOY?

39:46.918 --> 39:48.787
BY MOLESTING HIM,
ERIC KILLED HIS SPIRIT,

39:48.820 --> 39:50.456
WHICH PRETTY MUCH
DID THE SAME THING.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.892
IS THAT WHY
YOU BUTCHERED HIS BODY?

39:53.925 --> 39:55.160
I DIDN'T INTEND THAT.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.963
YOU REPEATEDLY STABBED HIM
AFTER HE WAS DEAD.

39:57.996 --> 39:58.864
WHICH WAS WHAT HE DESERVED.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.799
HE CROSSED A LINE
THAT WOULD NEVER BREACH.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.068
I KNOW WHO AND WHAT I AM.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.203
YOU KNOW, HE--I CAN'T
FALL OFF THE WAGON JUST ONCE.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.939
I CAN'T HAVE ONE...
JUST ONE.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.475
WHY--I CAN DO IT,
WHY CAN'T HE?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.543
HE WAS A PEDOPHILE.
SO AM I!

40:11.577 --> 40:14.045
IF YOU'VE NEVER TOUCHED A CHILD,
THEN THAT MAKES YOU A FIRST.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.148
I WOULDN'T HURT A CHILD.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.083
SO YOU SAY.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.786
BUT IT'S MY EXPERIENCE
THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU

40:20.819 --> 40:22.187
CAN'T CONTROL THEIR URGES.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.624
IT'S "DON'T," NOT "CAN'T."

40:25.657 --> 40:27.959
I'VE NEVER KNOWN THE SWEET
RELEASE OF BEING WITH A CHILD.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.562
IF I DID,
I COULDN'T STOP.

40:30.596 --> 40:31.863
ERIC BYERS
WOULD NEVER HAVE STOPPED,

40:31.897 --> 40:33.532
SO I DID YOU A FAVOR.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.834
SO DO ME ANOTHER ONE.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.503
TELL ME THE VICTIM'S NAME.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.472
I DON'T KNOW IT.
TELL ME WHO HE IS,

40:40.506 --> 40:42.207
SO I CAN GET HIM
SOME HELP.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.442
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

40:48.514 --> 40:51.182
IS THAT WHAT
SET YOU OFF?

40:51.216 --> 40:52.718
I WAS LIVID.

40:52.751 --> 40:53.819
HE BEGGED ME
TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

40:53.852 --> 40:54.920
HE SAID THAT HE
COULDN'T STOP.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.154
HE ASKED...

40:56.187 --> 40:58.857
HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD JUST
LET GO AND THAT I SHOULD DO IT.

40:58.890 --> 40:59.991
THAT I...

41:00.025 --> 41:01.527
[stomps floor]

41:01.560 --> 41:04.195
THAT I WOULD KNOW
THE BLISS,

41:04.229 --> 41:06.197
THAT I'D BE UNBURDENED,
AND...

41:06.231 --> 41:09.200
AND NOW THERE'S...
A KID OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,

41:09.234 --> 41:11.469
HURTING, AND THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.240
BECAUSE YOU JUST MURDERED
THE ONE PERSON

41:15.273 --> 41:18.243
WHO COULD LEAD ME TO HIM.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.513
[no audio]

41:21.547 --> 41:23.849
(Olivia)
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS YOUNG MAN BEFORE?

41:23.882 --> 41:25.150
(little boy)
YES.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.285
(Olivia)
YES? WHERE WERE YOU?

41:27.318 --> 41:28.787
(boy)
AT THE PLAYGROUND.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.289
HE GAVE ME CANDY.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.191
(Olivia)
DID HE TOUCH YOU?

41:33.224 --> 41:35.727
DID HE HURT YOU AT ALL?

41:35.761 --> 41:37.763
NO.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.600
YOU SURE?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.605
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.139
THIS WAY.

41:49.741 --> 41:50.942
NO JOY?

41:50.976 --> 41:52.811
THAT MAKES
INTERVIEW NUMBER FIVE.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.980
THEY ALL SAW
OR TALKED TO ERIC,

41:55.013 --> 41:57.115
BUT HE DIDN'T
TOUCH THEM.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.285
I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT
I MAY NEVER FIND OUR VICTIM.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.553
OLIVIA, HE'LL TURN UP.

42:01.587 --> 42:02.854
HE HAS TO.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.556
DON'T FORGET, ERIC
DESCRIBED THE ATTACK ONLINE

42:04.590 --> 42:05.857
IN GRAPHIC DETAIL.

42:05.891 --> 42:08.226
WHICH MEANS SOME KID
WILL HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS

42:08.259 --> 42:10.596
THAT NO PARENT
WILL BE ABLE TO IGNORE.

42:20.672 --> 42:23.208
I LOVE MY HUSBAND,
DETECTIVE.

42:23.241 --> 42:26.044
I KNOW YOU DO, LISA.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.914
[crying]
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.082
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

42:34.653 --> 42:36.354
BUT I DON'T WANNA DIE.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.824
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.626
HAVE A SEAT.

42:46.364 --> 42:49.000
BUT IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU CAME IN, OKAY?

42:49.034 --> 42:49.868
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,

42:49.901 --> 42:52.771
FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
AND YOUR FAMILY.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.640
NOW, CAN YOU TELL US...

42:54.673 --> 42:54.740
