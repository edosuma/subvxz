00:02.234 --> 00:05.136
I'm never gonna get
these useless lights untangled.

00:05.137 --> 00:06.938
Those lights aren't
useless, Sabrina.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.306
They probably grew up
underprivileged

00:08.307 --> 00:10.308
and never got
a decent education.

00:10.309 --> 00:12.877
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas.

00:12.878 --> 00:15.012
Is everyone feeling jolly?

00:15.013 --> 00:16.814
Ooh, I'm just gonna
chop 'em up into little pieces

00:16.815 --> 00:18.883
and leave 'em in a suitcase
by the highway.

00:18.884 --> 00:21.453
I'm going to broaden
my definition of jolly

00:21.454 --> 00:23.020
and take that as a "yes."

00:23.021 --> 00:24.655
Well, the lawn
is fully decorated

00:24.656 --> 00:26.291
and awash in lights.

00:26.292 --> 00:29.827
I even put red noses
on the flamingos.

00:29.828 --> 00:32.030
That is a pretty stupid outfit.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.399
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.200
SALEM:
So it's true.

00:36.201 --> 00:38.336
Taste does skip a generation.

00:39.405 --> 00:40.705
Sabrina, why aren't
you wearing

00:40.706 --> 00:42.307
the candy cane outfit
that I got for you?

00:42.308 --> 00:44.008
Self-respect.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.210
Ooh, that's it.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.045
I'm giving these lights
the finger.

00:48.580 --> 00:49.848
There.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.284
Oh, Sabrina, you didn't have
to use magic.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.553
The point of Christmas isn't
to have things perfect.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.821
It's to spend time
with your family.

00:56.822 --> 01:00.391
And frustration and cursing
are just part of the joy.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.660
Uh-oh.

01:02.661 --> 01:04.162
Circuit overload.
Uh-huh.

01:04.163 --> 01:06.464
Who's the stupid one now?

01:06.465 --> 01:07.499
Still you.

01:26.318 --> 01:28.152
Wanna play some reindeer games?

01:32.725 --> 01:36.027
Look, the new '99 snowboards
are sleeker, sturdier

01:36.028 --> 01:37.328
and faster than ever.

01:37.329 --> 01:39.797
We know you want
a snowboard, Salem.

01:39.798 --> 01:42.367
And the threatening letters
are not helping your case.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.468
Love this line:

01:43.469 --> 01:45.570
"Makes a perfect
Christmas gift."

01:45.571 --> 01:47.872
Man, that's good writing.

01:47.873 --> 01:49.640
Wasn't the lawn, the roof,
the living room enough?

01:49.641 --> 01:51.209
I mean,
does our garbage disposal

01:51.210 --> 01:53.278
really have to be festive?

01:53.279 --> 01:54.579
Sabrina, you are a regular

01:54.580 --> 01:56.448
Charlie I-Hate-Christmas
this year.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.615
What gives?

01:57.616 --> 01:58.849
I like Christmas.

01:58.850 --> 02:00.418
It's the constant need
for family fun

02:00.419 --> 02:01.886
that's bringing me down.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.554
Come on, get in the spirit.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.492
Look at all those lights
up there.

02:07.493 --> 02:10.328
People are in the holiday spirit
all over the world.

02:10.329 --> 02:13.031
Look, there's our house,
the brightest one of all.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.532
I knew the all-neon
Nativity scene

02:14.533 --> 02:16.634
would put us over the top.

02:16.635 --> 02:19.670
Unfortunately, truckers keep
stopping here for gas.

02:22.908 --> 02:25.243
It's an invitation
to a Christmas Eve party.

02:25.244 --> 02:26.544
Wow, it's the Cauldron.

02:26.545 --> 02:29.013
The hippest, most exclusive club
in the Other Realm.

02:29.014 --> 02:31.716
But Christmas Eve is the night
we have our family dinner.

02:31.717 --> 02:33.984
And that differs
from every other night how?

02:33.985 --> 02:35.252
We use the good china.

02:36.688 --> 02:38.389
( <i>festive theme playing</i> )

02:38.390 --> 02:40.091
Merry Christmas, everyone.

02:40.092 --> 02:42.761
This is my mom. She came
all the way from Terre Haute

02:42.762 --> 02:45.163
to spend Christmas with me.

02:45.164 --> 02:48.199
And in honor of her visit,
I'm canceling all tests today.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.668
( all cheer )

02:51.070 --> 02:52.436
BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

02:52.437 --> 02:53.838
Yeah, if you're
into hyperbole.

02:53.839 --> 02:54.939
What's wrong?

02:54.940 --> 02:57.174
Why is everyone
so darn happy?

02:57.175 --> 02:59.410
Well, my mom's morning sickness
is over,

02:59.411 --> 03:01.947
which means we'll be allowed
to have gravy at Christmas.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.148
Ooh, the whole family sitting
around the table,

03:04.149 --> 03:05.784
slurping up thickened
turkey drippings.

03:05.785 --> 03:07.552
That sure says
"Christmas" to me.

03:07.553 --> 03:09.253
I know. Heh.
Hey, and guess what.

03:09.254 --> 03:10.755
My aunt just hired me
at her boutique,

03:10.756 --> 03:13.091
and so far
I don't stink.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.659
Ever heard of nepotism?

03:14.660 --> 03:17.829
Jeez, Sabrina, you're being
a real Charlie Downer.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.431
Hey, this'll cheer you up.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.733
Fred Exley just invited us
to his Christmas party.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.602
I <i>could</i> use a night away
from my aunts.

03:24.603 --> 03:27.638
We must have done everything
Christmassy by now.

03:27.639 --> 03:28.706
But you promised us

03:28.707 --> 03:30.374
that tonight
you'd come a-caroling.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.176
But I'd really rather
go out partying.

03:32.177 --> 03:33.978
But you promised.

03:33.979 --> 03:36.881
Fine, I'll go don
my gay apparel.

03:36.882 --> 03:38.550
Is it just me,

03:38.551 --> 03:40.051
or have we been stringing
popcorn for hours

03:40.052 --> 03:41.052
and getting nowhere?

03:41.053 --> 03:42.921
( Salem munching and gulping )

03:42.922 --> 03:44.355
Salem.

03:44.356 --> 03:45.623
I'm only eating the popcorn

03:45.624 --> 03:48.393
because it helps me get
the string down.

03:49.828 --> 03:52.463
Well, what song
shall we start with?

03:52.464 --> 03:54.132
Anything dirge-like.

it's you...

Help me out here, Valerie.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.951
They're making snowballs
out back. Run.

04:13.952 --> 04:15.720
We'll try and hold 'em off.

04:15.721 --> 04:17.721
We'll tell 'em
you're lepers. Go.

What fun.

I bet
they've got wassail.

No, no. We don't
have time.

about selling Herbalife, is it?

Christmas stuff

we invited.

Ooh! I got him
right in the eye.

08:18.496 --> 08:21.431
When you hit the other eye,
it actually bleeds.

08:22.801 --> 08:23.801
How about that?

SABRINA:
A reindeer piñata?

REINDEER:
Oh, my spine!

Tell Blitzen I love him!
No, not the nose!

08:28.540 --> 08:30.274
Oh, that just
seems wrong.

08:30.275 --> 08:31.775
I knew you'd like it.

08:31.776 --> 08:32.910
Come over here.

It's a satellite feed
of families in the mortal realm

08:38.750 --> 08:40.918

at this very moment.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.321
It's priceless stuff.

08:43.322 --> 08:45.122
Well, I'm really not
into all this.

08:45.123 --> 08:48.025
I mean, you know,
not all traditions are bad.

08:48.026 --> 08:49.994
For example, I like
the tradition of...

08:49.995 --> 08:51.963
not doing this stuff.

08:53.832 --> 08:55.299
( laughs )

08:55.300 --> 08:56.801
Look at these two broads.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.570
Have you ever seen
anything more pathetic?

08:59.571 --> 09:01.805
Let's make it more pathetic.

<i>for Christmas.</i>

09:13.818 --> 09:15.286
Those are my aunts.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.121
And none of you are worthy
to gaze upon them,

09:17.122 --> 09:19.356
you hipper-than-thou,
tragically trendy,

09:19.357 --> 09:21.759
irony-addicted, snide,
smirking, jaded jerks.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.127
Give me that!
Not the remote!

09:24.363 --> 09:25.295
You're not nearly as cool

09:25.296 --> 09:26.431
as I thought you were.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.265
Well, I consider that
a huge compliment.

09:28.266 --> 09:29.867
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back

09:29.868 --> 09:31.669
to my "pathetic" Christmas.

09:37.575 --> 09:39.310
How could you
let Sabrina in here?

09:39.311 --> 09:41.511
Your job is to keep
the uncool people out.

09:41.512 --> 09:42.613
But you said...

09:42.614 --> 09:44.048
And then I thought...

09:44.049 --> 09:46.483
And then... Oh.

09:49.988 --> 09:51.154
Aunt Hilda. Aunt Zelda.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.624
I've finally decided,
after all that...

09:53.625 --> 09:55.459
MAN ( over TV ):
<i>With our contestants on-stage.</i>

09:55.460 --> 09:57.494
<i>What we're looking for is...</i>

09:57.495 --> 09:59.831
What happened
to all the decorations?

09:59.832 --> 10:01.198
And your holiday dinner?

10:01.199 --> 10:03.600
Holiday? What holiday?

10:03.601 --> 10:04.601
Christmas?

10:04.602 --> 10:07.638
Christmas?
What's Christmas?

10:12.745 --> 10:14.011
SABRINA:
I get it.

10:14.012 --> 10:16.480
You zapped away the decorations
to make a point.

10:16.481 --> 10:17.849
Okay, I've learned my lesson.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.117
Now, let's go have our
traditional Christmas Eve dinner

10:20.118 --> 10:22.119
and watch
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

10:22.120 --> 10:24.388
What is that, one of those
new, teen slasher movies?

10:24.389 --> 10:26.189
Sabrina, you can't stay
up late and watch TV.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.791
It's a school night.

10:27.792 --> 10:30.027
But tomorrow's December 25th.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.630
I know, the start of midterms.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.765
Oh, man, you guys
aren't joking, are you?

10:34.766 --> 10:37.035
Come on, Christmas?

10:37.036 --> 10:38.703
Santa Claus? Reindeer?

10:38.704 --> 10:39.971
Little drummer boys?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.373
If you're trying to convince us
that you have a fever,

10:42.374 --> 10:44.441
it's not working.

10:44.442 --> 10:46.243
Most delusions are
more coherent.

10:46.244 --> 10:47.745
I admit we could all use
a break.

10:47.746 --> 10:51.015
But luckily, summer vacation
is only seven months away.

10:51.016 --> 10:53.284
And you need your rest.
Good night, Sabrina.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.052
Good night.

10:55.053 --> 10:56.420
And...

10:56.421 --> 10:57.989
Merry Christmas.

10:59.024 --> 11:00.358
Christmas?

11:00.359 --> 11:03.393
Do think she's spending
too much time on the Internet?

11:05.730 --> 11:08.532
Sabrina, what happened
to Christmas?

11:08.533 --> 11:09.867
Salem, you remember?

11:09.868 --> 11:10.935
Whatever spell you've enacted

11:10.936 --> 11:12.837
doesn't affect witch familiars.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.639
I enacted?
I'm guessing

11:14.640 --> 11:15.572
you must have done something

11:15.573 --> 11:17.241
at that party
in the Other Realm.

11:17.242 --> 11:19.977
All I did was turn off the TV
and storm out.

11:19.978 --> 11:21.578
That wouldn't
do anything.

11:21.579 --> 11:24.281
Unless you used the remote
and hit the erase button.

11:24.282 --> 11:26.817
I did use the remote
and I might have hit erase.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.986
( sobbing ):
Oh, no! It's gone!

11:28.987 --> 11:31.155
You've erased Christmas.

11:31.156 --> 11:34.091
It was my favorite
gift-getting holiday.

11:34.092 --> 11:35.827
Wait a minute, we're jumping
to conclusions.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.096
I mean, maybe I didn't erase
Christmas for the whole world.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.096
Let's check.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.635
Do you think maybe in a minute,
the lights will go on

11:44.636 --> 11:47.238
and the whole world
will yell "gotcha"?

11:47.239 --> 11:49.240
Sabrina, if you don't reverse
the spell in 24 hours,

11:49.241 --> 11:51.875
Christmas will be erased
permanently.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.878
How do you know that?
Years ago, I was at a party

11:53.879 --> 11:56.947
in the Other Realm
and I erased Bobunk.

11:56.948 --> 11:59.149
I've never heard of it.
That's my point!

11:59.150 --> 12:01.352
I never did figure out
how to reverse the spell,

12:01.353 --> 12:03.454
and Bobunk was gone forever.

12:03.455 --> 12:05.690
Ah, the days of Bobunk.

12:05.691 --> 12:07.291
Salem, I've got to find a way

12:07.292 --> 12:08.859
to bring the spirit
of Christmas back.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.627
Maybe if I start doing
Christmassy things,

12:10.628 --> 12:12.195
people will start to remember.

12:12.196 --> 12:13.997
That didn't work with Bobunk.

12:13.998 --> 12:16.167
Stop saying Bobunk.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.334
( door slams )

12:21.239 --> 12:22.940
Merry Christmas.

12:22.941 --> 12:24.508
Oh, that again.

12:24.509 --> 12:27.178
I'm sorry, I'm not up
on the current hip lingo.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.780
I made you breakfast. We've got
delicious Christmas food.

12:29.781 --> 12:32.349
Here. Some eggnog,
a candy cane.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.084
Give it a try.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.487
Oh!
Oh, that is disgusting.

12:37.488 --> 12:38.823
Who ever heard
of drinking an egg?

12:38.824 --> 12:39.824
( crunches )
Ah!

12:39.825 --> 12:41.525
Oh, I think
I chipped my tooth.

12:41.526 --> 12:43.227
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

12:43.228 --> 12:44.895
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

12:44.896 --> 12:47.798
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

12:47.799 --> 12:49.366
Merry December 25th,
everyone.

12:51.469 --> 12:53.537
Hey, guys. There you go.

12:53.538 --> 12:54.805
What's this for?

12:54.806 --> 12:55.839
It's December 25th.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.775
A day to celebrate
and feel merry, right?

12:57.776 --> 12:58.909
Are you kidding me?

12:58.910 --> 13:00.511
My aunt just fired me
from her store.

13:00.512 --> 13:02.546
She said it's her slow time
of the year.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.782
Now what am I gonna do
for money?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.651
Thanks, Sabrina.

13:07.652 --> 13:09.453
Hey, I'll sell you this
for 5 bucks.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.221
No, thanks.
My allowance got cut

13:11.222 --> 13:14.058
'cause my dad's exterminating
business isn't doing well.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.693
Nobody has parties
this time of year,

13:15.694 --> 13:18.762
so people don't care if their
homes are riddled with insects.

13:18.763 --> 13:20.164
Oh, Mrs. Quick,
I got you a present.

13:20.165 --> 13:22.366
Don't try and butter me up,
Sabrina.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.801
We're having
that midterm today.

13:23.802 --> 13:26.070
It'll do my heart good to watch
the weaker brains explode

13:26.071 --> 13:28.805
in a fleshy, fiery eruption.

13:28.806 --> 13:30.574
Mrs. Quick,
this isn't like you.

13:30.575 --> 13:34.211
Oh, you try working September
to June without a break!

13:34.212 --> 13:36.313
( sobbing ):
I miss my family.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.450
Would a tie cheer you up?

13:40.451 --> 13:44.355
¶ Silent night ¶

13:44.356 --> 13:46.790
¶ Holy night ¶

13:46.791 --> 13:48.225
QUICK:
Sabrina.

13:48.226 --> 13:50.794
Stop that.
We need complete silence.

13:50.795 --> 13:51.896
Well, that's why I thought

13:51.897 --> 13:54.232
"Silent Night"
would be appropriate.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.666
Never heard of that song.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.334
Is it on the new
Céline Dion album?

13:57.335 --> 13:58.269
( pencil tapping )

13:58.270 --> 14:00.504
Please be quiet
and get back to your tests.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.673
HARVEY:
Open up! We want lunch!

14:03.909 --> 14:06.143
In the name of all
that is greasy and deep-fried,

14:06.144 --> 14:08.145
open this door!

14:11.616 --> 14:13.550
Ah, if Charles Dickens'
<i>A Christmas Carol</i>

14:13.551 --> 14:16.186
doesn't jog people's memories,
nothing will.

14:19.991 --> 14:21.925
( indistinct chatter )

14:23.595 --> 14:25.362
Scrooge.

14:25.363 --> 14:26.997
Ebenezer Scrooge.

14:26.998 --> 14:29.433
I am your partner,
Jacob Marley.

14:29.434 --> 14:32.269
You'll be visited
by three ghosts.

14:32.270 --> 14:35.306
See, this is because
she's hungry.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.942
Why would somebody cut down
a perfectly good tree

14:37.943 --> 14:39.209
and bring it indoors?

14:39.210 --> 14:40.844
Bah! Humbug!

14:40.845 --> 14:42.646
Please go away.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.220
( high voice ):
God bless us, everyone.

14:50.221 --> 14:53.090
Sabrina, I'm afraid
you're suspended

14:53.091 --> 14:54.892
until the proper mental
health professionals

14:54.893 --> 14:56.660
have been contacted.

14:56.661 --> 14:59.497
( normal voice ):
But no one's had
their Christmas goose.

15:00.865 --> 15:02.366
Anybody want
to sit on my lap?

15:02.367 --> 15:04.268
It could bring back
a beloved holiday.

15:04.269 --> 15:06.403
Hey, little girl,
want to sit on my lap?

15:06.404 --> 15:08.305
You could tell me
all the presents you want.

15:09.574 --> 15:11.241
Come on, sit on my lap.

15:11.242 --> 15:13.277
Come on, how could it hurt?
Sit on my lap.

15:14.745 --> 15:16.179
I said sit on my freaking lap.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.882
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

15:22.888 --> 15:25.689
Oh, I can explain.
See, she was...

15:25.690 --> 15:27.758
And, uh, it's because I...

15:27.759 --> 15:28.492
Ugh!

15:34.799 --> 15:36.400
Is this your niece?

15:37.569 --> 15:38.702
I'm not sure.

15:38.703 --> 15:40.337
She was in Grafton's
department store

15:40.338 --> 15:42.139
causing a major disturbance.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.473
I was gonna arrest her,
but I decided

15:43.474 --> 15:45.242
to bring her here
and put her in your custody.

15:45.243 --> 15:48.278
Because you're so full
of the holiday spirit?

15:48.279 --> 15:49.980
She's talking crazy.

15:49.981 --> 15:52.182
Merry this, happy that.

15:52.183 --> 15:55.352
If I were you,
I'd check her urine.

15:56.321 --> 15:57.788
Time's running out.
I feel terrible.

15:57.789 --> 15:58.922
You?

15:58.923 --> 16:01.458
Did you see the size
of that snowboard?

16:01.459 --> 16:02.559
I've got to find someone,

16:02.560 --> 16:04.828
anyone in this world
who remembers Christmas.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.630
How about Father Christmas?

16:06.631 --> 16:08.933
Is he real?
As real as actual Christmas.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.301
I guess right now
that's not such a good example.

16:11.302 --> 16:13.537
See if he's in
the Witch pink pages.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.409
He's listed.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.577
SALEM:
You're lucky.

16:20.578 --> 16:22.913
There was no Father Bobunk.

16:22.914 --> 16:24.748
Father Christmas?
Hm?

16:24.749 --> 16:26.050
I'm Sabrina Spellman,

16:26.051 --> 16:27.384
the girl who
erased Christmas.

16:27.385 --> 16:28.652
Please don't be mad.

16:28.653 --> 16:29.653
Ho! Mad?

16:29.654 --> 16:31.822
My dear girl, thanks to you,

16:31.823 --> 16:35.626
we're having our very first
real family vacation.

16:35.627 --> 16:36.760
My wife,

16:36.761 --> 16:38.295
Mumsy Christmas,

16:38.296 --> 16:40.731
and the little tykes,
our grandchildren:

16:40.732 --> 16:43.633
Binky, Bunny,

16:43.634 --> 16:46.103
Boopsie, Winnie,

16:46.104 --> 16:48.905
Minnie, Mopsy,

16:48.906 --> 16:51.275
and Fred.

16:51.276 --> 16:52.642
Isn't Christmas important?

16:52.643 --> 16:56.480
But so is spending time
with your family, eh?

16:56.481 --> 16:58.081
Look how many fish
I've caught, eh?

16:58.082 --> 16:59.383
Ho-ho.

16:59.384 --> 17:02.720
After a time one does get
used to the smell.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.255
But couldn't you help me
get Christmas back,

17:04.256 --> 17:05.922
I mean, as a favor?

17:05.923 --> 17:07.691
I didn't want to mention this,
but my country

17:07.692 --> 17:09.792
did save your butt
during World War II.

17:09.794 --> 17:12.463
I am afraid
I can't help you, Sabrina.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.132
Only you can undo
what you've done.

17:15.133 --> 17:16.465
Thanks, anyway.

17:16.467 --> 17:17.968
Mm-hm. Ta-ta.

17:20.104 --> 17:23.107
And I'd put some sun block
on these pasty kids.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.942
SALEM:
No Christmas.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.377
No hope for mankind,

17:27.378 --> 17:29.579
and you didn't even
bring me a fish?

17:29.580 --> 17:32.583
It's 11:00. Christmas is
almost gone for good.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.519
Maybe now Arbor Day
will come into its own.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.920
We're going to the pharmacy.

17:36.921 --> 17:39.323
It's the perfect time of year
to wait in a prescription line.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.258
SALEM:
It's snowing fiercely
out there.

17:41.259 --> 17:43.293
Conditions are hazardous
and life-threatening.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.062
Pick me up
a Nutrageous bar, okay?

17:45.063 --> 17:48.232
Salem's right. It's really
coming down out there.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.666
Well, I suppose
I can wait another day

17:49.667 --> 17:50.701
to get my face cream.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.769
No comments from
the peanut gallery.

17:54.205 --> 17:56.139
Honey, are you okay?

17:56.140 --> 17:57.941
We've been worried
about you.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.877
I've just been realizing
that there are some things

17:59.878 --> 18:01.411
you don't miss
until they're gone.

18:01.412 --> 18:03.313
Like a snowboard.

18:04.415 --> 18:05.415
Hey!

18:06.384 --> 18:07.218
Ooh!

18:07.219 --> 18:09.186
Oh! Ow!

18:09.187 --> 18:10.720
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

18:10.721 --> 18:13.256
( all laughing and giggling )

18:13.257 --> 18:15.292
Someone's gonna end up crying.

18:15.293 --> 18:17.528
Probably me.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.929
( chuckles )

18:18.930 --> 18:20.464
I'm starving.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.265
Last one to the kitchen
makes the sandwiches.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.140
You're last!

18:30.141 --> 18:31.441
No, you're last.

18:31.442 --> 18:32.709
Let's ask the judges.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.244
( buzzer buzzes )

18:34.245 --> 18:35.545
You're both last.

18:35.546 --> 18:38.215
Fine, Aunt Hilda and I
will both make the sandwiches.

18:38.216 --> 18:39.616
I'll take tuna.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.925
( chuckling ):
Hey!

18:51.296 --> 18:52.262
( screams )

18:52.263 --> 18:53.363
Ladies, not again.

18:53.364 --> 18:54.965
Yes! Oh!

18:58.670 --> 19:00.137
Dive! Dive!

19:03.274 --> 19:04.808
Oh.

19:04.809 --> 19:06.276
I'm still hungry.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.278
Fine. You guys clean up
and I'll make the sandwiches.

19:08.279 --> 19:10.281
Done.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.483
Thanks. Now, you guys go wait
in the dining room.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.618
You know what?
I'm glad we got snowed in.

19:14.619 --> 19:15.719
Me too.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.187
I'm pretty sure
I ruptured something,

19:17.188 --> 19:19.556
but, yeah, it was fun.

19:21.526 --> 19:23.093
You know, Salem,

19:23.094 --> 19:24.060
Father Christmas was right.

19:24.061 --> 19:25.462
All the hoopla of Christmas

19:25.463 --> 19:28.432
isn't as important as spending
time with your family.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.035
Sabrina, you're back.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.337
You decided to spend
Christmas Eve with us after all.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.804
That's so wonderful.

19:34.805 --> 19:36.507
It's not Christmas Eve.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.776
Christmas! You said Christmas!

19:40.478 --> 19:42.279
Come on, Salem.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.215
The tree, it's here.

19:45.216 --> 19:47.451
Oh, and the decorations,
they're incredible.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.652
I'm so happy

19:48.653 --> 19:51.821
Christmas didn't suffer
the fate of Bobunk.

19:51.822 --> 19:53.757
BOTH:
What's Bobunk?

19:53.758 --> 19:55.159
( doorbell rings )

19:58.028 --> 19:59.663
BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

19:59.664 --> 20:01.565
You don't know how happy I am
to hear you say that.

20:01.566 --> 20:04.134
We just thought we'd stop by
and give you your presents

20:04.135 --> 20:06.236
so we could get back
to our families.

20:06.237 --> 20:08.972
Mom's letting us
have coffee too.

20:08.973 --> 20:11.408
VALERIE:
And it's rumored that
my parents have branched out

20:11.409 --> 20:13.844
from the traditional
pajama-and-underwear gifts.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.747
Why are you smiling so much?

20:16.748 --> 20:17.614
Because...

20:18.850 --> 20:20.083
Because...

20:20.084 --> 20:22.319
Because Harvey's
under the mistletoe.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.889
Anybody want some eggnog?

20:25.890 --> 20:27.624
Me. I love eggnog.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.293
This is great.

20:29.294 --> 20:30.594
All the people I love most
in the world

20:30.595 --> 20:33.097
together under one beautifully
overdecorated roof.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.732
Well, I think this
calls for a toast.

20:35.733 --> 20:36.733
To family.

20:36.734 --> 20:38.202
To friends.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.571
To Christmas.
It's back and better than ever.

20:46.511 --> 20:49.446
Hey, this one's
from Father Christmas.

20:49.447 --> 20:50.914
Oh, cousin Kris
sent you a present.

20:50.915 --> 20:52.382
How thoughtful.

20:52.383 --> 20:54.150
We're related to him?
HILDA: Distantly.

20:54.151 --> 20:56.619
You kind of forget about it
until he needs money.

20:57.989 --> 20:59.256
Robert E. Lee.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.158
Must be a clue
to the family secret.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.494
I can never get
enough of these.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.863
"Dear Sabrina, thanks
for the vacation.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.764
"Once Christmas returned,
I knew you figured out

21:07.765 --> 21:09.666
"what I was trying to tell you
about family.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.869
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,
joyous Bobunk."

21:12.870 --> 21:14.672
Speaking of Bobunk,
where's Salem?

21:14.673 --> 21:17.640
Sabrina,
stop this crazy thing!

21:17.641 --> 21:19.842
SALEM:
Oh, my spine!
