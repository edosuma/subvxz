Going to be a big job, though.

02:24.047 --> 02:26.845
Carol? What's going on?

My way of contributing,

the competition, so much the better.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.366

- What competition?
- Didn't you see the letter?

02:40.287 --> 02:43.120
- What letter?
- From the council, l left it on table.

02:43.167 --> 02:46.477
New initiative, so tenants
show respect for their houses.

02:46.527 --> 02:48.995
There's a year's free rent for
the house with the best-kept exterior.

02:49.047 --> 02:52.084
A year's free rent? You're joking!

02:52.127 --> 02:55.199
- Why didn't someone tell me?
- Don't you get post at your house?

02:55.247 --> 02:58.842

- No one else will make that sort of effort.
- So?

So, thanks to my mother helping next door,

04:18.327 --> 04:21.558
theirs looks good while ours
looks like Steptoe's bleeding yard.

04:21.607 --> 04:24.917
Oh, no. l am not gardening
if that is where this is leading.

04:24.967 --> 04:27.117
Not for some poxy competition.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.156
Kev...

04:28.207 --> 04:30.163
lt's for a year's free rent.

Day after tomorrow, you know where we are.
Dress to impress.

Did you shout earlier?
We were having a lie-down.

05:12.247 --> 05:15.205
Borrowed Steve's mobile,
mine's as flat as a pancake.

Oh, Kerry Anne, who the...

05:20.647 --> 05:22.126
Oh, it's not my phone.

05:28.687 --> 05:30.484
'Could be a mistake.'

05:30.527 --> 05:32.802
l got one asking if the gecko was still for sale.

05:32.847 --> 05:35.441
''See you tomorrow,
can't wait, four fucking kisses?''

05:35.487 --> 05:39.082
He's met someone else.
Who the fuck is Kerry Anne?

05:39.127 --> 05:43.439
- You could always ring her.
- And say what?

05:43.487 --> 05:46.047
Trust my mum to go sticking her nose in.

05:46.087 --> 05:48.760
Veronica, if it's the truth, l'd rather know.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.004
- You can't go charging in all guns blazing.
- Why not?

05:52.047 --> 05:55.403
Because you're angry.
Whatever he says, you'll only hear guilt.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.161
That proves nothing.

05:58.207 --> 06:00.243
Steve's not the affair type,

06:00.287 --> 06:03.597
but it tells you one thing -
he's meant to be meeting her tomorrow.

06:03.647 --> 06:06.286
So then you'll find out whether he's lying.

06:07.127 --> 06:08.480
Yeah.

06:29.567 --> 06:32.684
Getting people to do their own gardens.

06:32.727 --> 06:35.082

07:56.727 --> 08:00.322
Well, remember the council
wasting all that money

08:00.367 --> 08:03.040
on the Diana memorial garden?

08:04.607 --> 08:07.075
lt's what she would have wanted.

We're gonna win! We're gonna win!
l love you! l love you!

08:18.527 --> 08:20.916

08:21.887 --> 08:23.605
Just appeared overnight.

08:23.647 --> 08:25.877
< Must be God, looking out for us.

08:25.927 --> 08:28.282
Yeah, God and his mates, Tommy and Phil.

08:28.327 --> 08:30.124
You nicked it?

08:30.167 --> 08:31.680
Best 50 quid l ever spent.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.996
You've done this out of spite!

08:37.047 --> 08:39.197
lt's our garden. We'll do what we like!

08:39.246 --> 08:42.922
She's always been like this,
always has to go one better.

08:42.967 --> 08:47.006
What is your problem?
Why can't you be pleased for me?

08:47.047 --> 08:51.563
Hang on a minute, calm down.
Both gardens look better than they did.

08:51.607 --> 08:53.837
Yeah, but ours is a bit shit in comparison.

08:53.887 --> 08:57.004
A year's free rent coming our way.

08:57.047 --> 09:00.722
My own daughter turns against me.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.444
Taxi will be here any minute.

09:09.487 --> 09:12.160
l still don't understand why
the twins can't go with you.

09:12.207 --> 09:14.004
Frank, she's in a hospice.

09:14.047 --> 09:16.561
Yeah, but do they not have a creche?

09:18.567 --> 09:20.285
Just a couple of days, you'll manage.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.363
l'm worried about you.

09:22.407 --> 09:25.365
lt's not good for mothers
to be apart from their nippers,

09:25.407 --> 09:27.204
it plays havoc with the hormones.

09:27.247 --> 09:30.205
Everything's here. l've colour-coded them.

09:30.247 --> 09:33.125
Morning is green, afternoon is amber,
evening is red.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.725
Well, puce.

09:34.767 --> 09:37.235
lt's like a traffic light in reverse.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.881
Here's a list of what everything does.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.600
l have brought up six of my own.
What about grub?

09:42.647 --> 09:46.481
Six drafts of milk in the fridge,
baby rice in the cupboard.

09:46.527 --> 09:47.721
l meant for me!

09:49.527 --> 09:50.846
Nothing can go wrong.

09:50.887 --> 09:53.526
Anything else?

09:54.407 --> 09:55.396
Bye.

10:04.287 --> 10:08.439

11:06.687 --> 11:08.564
You malicious old bitch!

11:08.607 --> 11:10.563
Veronica. Everybody's in bed!

11:10.607 --> 11:11.926
What's she saying about me?

11:11.967 --> 11:13.446
Oh, Carol. Go back to bed.

11:13.487 --> 11:16.001
Who did she get to do it for you?
One of your shags?

11:16.047 --> 11:17.082
What are you talking about?

11:17.127 --> 11:19.163
Our garden, you vicious old cow!

11:19.207 --> 11:22.882
l've not touched your precious bloody garden!

11:22.927 --> 11:25.919
- You're making a show of yourself. Go indoors.
- lt's all right for you.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.844
You don't need a year's free rent,

11:27.887 --> 11:30.196
cos flash twat's bought you a spare house!

11:30.247 --> 11:31.805
We still pay for next door!

11:31.847 --> 11:33.599
lf you hadn't spent the last month

11:33.647 --> 11:36.445
trying to find a million reasons
why your mum and Marty

11:36.487 --> 11:40.605
couldn't move back into your house,
none of this would have happened!

11:43.567 --> 11:45.523
Fuck off!

11:46.447 --> 11:47.562
You...

11:56.887 --> 11:59.162
Mm. There's a face l'm happy to see.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.719
- You all right?
- Where have you been?

12:06.767 --> 12:08.883
Stoke.

12:08.927 --> 12:14.638
l thought l told you.
Had to offload that Freelander.

12:14.687 --> 12:16.245
l'm gonna have a beer and l'll follow you up.

12:28.567 --> 12:30.797

12:42.127 --> 12:45.756
Never gonna run around and desert you

12:45.807 --> 12:50.676
(Muffled) Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye...

12:50.727 --> 12:53.366
All right, Sergeant, through the back entrance.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.045
..Hurt you... lt's a raid!

12:55.087 --> 12:56.406
Fucking 'ell!

13:08.847 --> 13:12.078
All right, sir? What can l do for you?

13:12.127 --> 13:14.243
Just you two, is it?

13:16.647 --> 13:18.683
BABlES GURGLE

13:18.727 --> 13:20.843
- Whose are they?
- (Both) Mine!

13:25.167 --> 13:26.725
Out.

13:26.767 --> 13:30.316
Yeah, no. The thing is, see.
l know what it looks like...

13:30.367 --> 13:34.599
l've three of my own. l know it can be hard,
getting out, getting a beer.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.481
But the simple fact is,
they don't come in here. Ever.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.166
Now get 'em home.

13:42.647 --> 13:49.917
1 2:30. Residential area. Pub full of drinkers.
That's a violation of your licence.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.639
l'm doing you a favour.

13:51.687 --> 13:54.440
lf they're in here, they're not out there.

13:54.487 --> 13:58.560
Council orders. Straight from the top.
Zero tolerance.

13:58.607 --> 14:01.963
Temporary cessation of licence,
pending appeal.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.283
- You're closing us down?
- Short, sharp shock.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.885
That's the message from on high.

14:06.927 --> 14:13.799
But surely we could come to...
some sort of arrangement?

14:15.207 --> 14:16.799
No.

14:16.847 --> 14:19.486
Get 'em out of here.

14:19.527 --> 14:25.079
- Anyone would think there was a war on.
- You are spot on, Frank.

14:25.127 --> 14:29.484
They only introduced the law
to stop miners getting pissed all night.

14:29.527 --> 14:32.280
l mean. Hello...

14:32.327 --> 14:37.924
Who the fuck has to get up in the morning?
Find the keys.

14:37.967 --> 14:42.597
- Cracking house, Frank.
- Everything has to come at a price.

14:44.567 --> 14:48.560
- Where the fuck are we going to drink now?
-Tommy, l just don't fucking know.

14:48.607 --> 14:50.199
Come on.

14:50.247 --> 14:53.125
How long is Sheila away for?

14:54.007 --> 14:55.235
Frank?

15:02.927 --> 15:04.804
(All) Surprise!

15:04.847 --> 15:06.519
Happy birthday, Carol!

15:06.567 --> 15:09.286

She only did it to keep hold of me.

25:01.207 --> 25:05.405

allow myself to get trapped. Not in that life.

25:06.767 --> 25:08.120
How often do you see her?

25:10.887 --> 25:14.482
Three or four times a year.
Special occasions, birthdays...

25:14.527 --> 25:17.439
The contact - that's a new thing.

25:17.487 --> 25:19.603

- When did you last see your daughter?

only shagging her to put one over on him.

30:57.127 --> 31:00.164
Where the fuck's the other one?

31:00.207 --> 31:04.485
Tommy, what's happened to the other one?

31:04.527 --> 31:07.963
Right, the last l saw... Sally. Adam.

31:08.007 --> 31:09.076
What, Psycho Sally?

31:16.167 --> 31:19.364
- Jesus. Er, is your Sally in?
- Stuart.

31:19.407 --> 31:21.523
- Stuart.
- That fucking nancy boy?!

31:21.567 --> 31:24.161
Try the Nancy House on Nancy St!

31:28.167 --> 31:30.442
Oh, Brenda. You're looking lovely.

31:30.487 --> 31:33.285
You've gotta help us.
Have you seen Psycho Sally?

31:33.327 --> 31:36.444
(Man's voice) Not recently.
l heard he was shacked up with little Lisa.

31:36.487 --> 31:39.604
Who the fucking hell is little Lisa?

31:47.207 --> 31:50.483
- Are you from the council?
- Do we look like the fucking council?!

31:50.527 --> 31:53.325
Sally, where the fuck's Sally?! Sally!

31:53.367 --> 31:56.837
Where is the twisted fucking weirdo?!

31:56.887 --> 32:00.163
- Taken t'baby out.
- Yeah, my fuckin' baby!

32:00.207 --> 32:01.356
Frank!

32:02.407 --> 32:04.967
- Frank!
- Nothing but fucking weirdos!

32:06.367 --> 32:08.119
He's got womb envy!

32:08.167 --> 32:10.635
He doesn't mean any harm.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.916
There she is. That's Kerry Anne.

32:17.967 --> 32:19.480
The short one.

32:20.967 --> 32:23.527
Joe picks her up every day after work.

32:23.567 --> 32:27.355
They collect Miranda on the way home.
lt's like clockwork.

32:27.407 --> 32:28.476
She's lovely.

32:28.527 --> 32:31.564
(Fiona) Really lovely.

32:31.607 --> 32:33.518
They're a real family, Fiona.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.362
They have everything they want.

32:40.447 --> 32:41.960
They don't need me.

32:51.487 --> 32:53.443
So, are you coming to meet her?

32:54.807 --> 32:57.765
No. No, l'll wait here.

33:06.927 --> 33:09.680
Hi, Uncle Steve!

33:32.647 --> 33:34.763
Mr Fitch, Council. >

33:34.807 --> 33:36.365
Come to judge your garden.

33:36.407 --> 33:38.318
Oh, right, yeah. Come in.

33:41.767 --> 33:46.682
- Er, when do we find out if we've won?
- No idea. Ring the council.

33:46.727 --> 33:49.924
- You are the council.
- l just tick boxes.

34:11.286 --> 34:14.324
The fella's here from the council.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.676
Come to judge...the garden.

34:16.726 --> 34:19.195
Do you wanna ask him any questions?

34:19.246 --> 34:20.726
Fine. Fuck you!

34:23.487 --> 34:25.955
Make yourself at home.

34:27.687 --> 34:29.120
All right?

34:29.167 --> 34:31.726
HE TRlES TO SPEAK

34:31.766 --> 34:36.079
What? Oh, shit! Shit!

34:36.127 --> 34:38.766
Wait there! lt'll be all right. Veronica. Veronica!

34:41.206 --> 34:43.926
- Oh, Veronica, for fuck's sake!
- What's going on?

34:43.967 --> 34:46.686
- Him. Dying. Ambulance.
- Where's Veronica?

34:46.726 --> 34:48.558
Not talking. Guess why?!

34:48.607 --> 34:50.996
Veronica. For God's sake!

34:51.766 --> 34:54.884
Recovery position. On your side!

34:54.927 --> 34:57.202
- No! Sit him up!
- He's having a heart attack.

34:57.247 --> 35:00.922
l can see that.
Sit him up! Keep the blood circulating.

35:00.967 --> 35:02.639
Come on, mate. Are you all right?

35:02.687 --> 35:05.121
Can you understand what l'm saying?

35:05.167 --> 35:07.476
- Have we called an ambulance?
- lt's on its way.

35:07.527 --> 35:09.324
Pock... Pocket.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.562
He's got tablets. Get him some water.

35:11.607 --> 35:15.077
And bring a cold flannel.
And see if you can find any aspirin.

35:15.127 --> 35:18.244
lt were just a wank, Veronica.
Nothing perverse.

35:18.287 --> 35:19.037
Marty!

35:19.087 --> 35:21.555
You were trying for babies.
He thought he was impotent.

35:21.607 --> 35:25.725
So we went to get tested. But he couldn't do it
with the jazz mags. Wanking!

35:25.767 --> 35:29.919
- Shall we talk about this later?
- Probably scared that he couldn't be a father.

35:29.967 --> 35:33.846
He needed a helping hand.
Did it for you, Veronica.

35:33.887 --> 35:37.197
He were looking at a picture of you
the whole time.

35:37.247 --> 35:40.444
l swear to God. lt's the truth.

35:43.567 --> 35:45.239
She needed to hear it.

35:47.807 --> 35:49.923
- Thanks.
- Help me.

35:49.967 --> 35:52.720
Right. How many of these are we taking?

35:52.767 --> 35:54.246
One.

35:54.287 --> 35:59.998
Little Nigel.
Little baby Nigel, with some pervert.

36:00.047 --> 36:02.686
Shall we see if the police can find him?

36:02.727 --> 36:04.558
Here we go.

36:04.607 --> 36:06.086
Oh, Jesus.

36:06.127 --> 36:09.278
What's going on?

36:11.047 --> 36:13.242
Frank Gallagher?

36:13.287 --> 36:14.879
More's the pity.

36:14.927 --> 36:17.043
Picked up your baby-sitter.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.679
Oh!

36:18.727 --> 36:20.206
< Pissed on a park bench.

36:20.247 --> 36:22.807
She asked us to return him.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.886
Often leave your kids with
alcoholic transvestites, Frank?

36:26.927 --> 36:32.285
Three strikes and you're out. Understand?
Party's over.

36:35.327 --> 36:38.876
He-he-he! Got ya! Got ya back!

36:38.927 --> 36:41.316
Hello! Come on, eh?!

36:41.367 --> 36:48.045
- Together again! Sorted. Sorted.
- Look at that! Two peas in a pod.

36:48.087 --> 36:50.442
- Eh. Look...
- You'll be all right, won't you?

36:50.487 --> 36:52.000
Frank!

36:53.367 --> 36:54.846
Frank! >

36:54.887 --> 36:56.161
(Oh, mother of Christ!)

36:58.527 --> 37:00.085
Surprise!

37:02.687 --> 37:06.043
Hey, no, it's all right.
lf you're not in the mood l can always...

37:09.207 --> 37:12.961
- Did you not get my message?
- No. What message?

37:13.007 --> 37:14.679
Me mum's dead.

37:14.727 --> 37:17.036
Me mum's dead!

37:25.287 --> 37:30.361
So you'll put in a good word for us
about the gardening competition?

37:30.407 --> 37:31.760
The whole thing's a sham.

37:33.087 --> 37:35.760
lt's a free clean up. Winner'll be...

37:38.007 --> 37:39.838
..house most in arrears.

37:57.807 --> 37:59.798
lt's working!

38:13.047 --> 38:14.526
So?

38:16.807 --> 38:19.719
So...

38:19.767 --> 38:22.361
lt were just before our Kelly moved to Paphos.

38:22.407 --> 38:26.241
And this arsehole she was going out with

38:26.287 --> 38:28.881
kept calling me ''dry balls'',

38:28.927 --> 38:32.044
cos he'd had four kids to four different women

38:32.087 --> 38:35.796
and couldn't believe
l hadn't slipped one past the goalie.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.236
Why didn't you tell me?

38:38.287 --> 38:40.801
Cos l was embarrassed.

38:40.847 --> 38:42.485
l just wanted to give you a kid.

38:43.927 --> 38:45.246
l know.

38:46.407 --> 38:50.446
But why did you have to pick our bleedin' Marty!

38:50.487 --> 38:53.126
And how did him doing it help?

38:53.167 --> 38:55.442
He's not even good-looking!

38:55.487 --> 38:57.000
Good-looking?!

38:57.047 --> 38:58.958
He's a bloke, for fuck's sake!

39:01.487 --> 39:06.083
Anyway, look. l needed some help
and l was looking at you the whole time.

39:06.127 --> 39:07.606
Oh, Kev!

39:10.367 --> 39:13.837
This, Kev - us,

39:13.887 --> 39:18.722
it's the one thing in my life
that's got absolutely nothing to do

39:18.767 --> 39:22.043
with my stupid bleedin' family.

39:22.087 --> 39:23.998
From now on,

39:24.047 --> 39:25.924
can we keep it that way?

39:35.327 --> 39:36.316
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

39:38.367 --> 39:42.201
Veronica. l really need a friend.

39:42.967 --> 39:44.366
Come on.

39:47.567 --> 39:48.636
lt's not that he lied.

39:48.687 --> 39:53.317
l understand why he might have wanted
to bury it, but when l saw him, holding her...

39:55.287 --> 39:58.040
There are fathers fighting through the courts,

39:58.087 --> 40:01.124
because they can't get access to their kids.

40:01.167 --> 40:04.125
How can he not want to be part of her life?

40:04.167 --> 40:10.402
He goes around like nothing can faze him,
tough, confident, answer for everything.

40:10.447 --> 40:12.881
Now l realise that comes at a price.

40:14.447 --> 40:17.803
There's no way around it, Fiona.
We never really know 'em.

40:17.847 --> 40:21.396
We think we do.
We think there's nothing can surprise us.

40:21.447 --> 40:24.200
Then they get wanked off by your brother.

40:31.807 --> 40:35.846
Sorry about lumbering you
with my mum and Marty.

40:35.887 --> 40:37.764
l can't live with her, Fiona.

40:37.807 --> 40:41.004
She makes me feel like l'm seven again.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.962
Why don't we keep them?

40:45.007 --> 40:48.238
They can't come back here.
You'll end up murdering each other.

40:48.287 --> 40:49.402
But you don't want them.

40:51.487 --> 40:53.478
We'll cope. One condition...

40:53.527 --> 40:59.238
They pay their way.
Rent, bills - then we know where we stand.

40:59.287 --> 41:01.721
Oh, thank you!

41:04.807 --> 41:06.365
Ah! >

41:07.247 --> 41:10.956
You two OK?
We've behaved like right idiots, haven't we?

41:11.007 --> 41:14.556
Normal service shall be resumed.

41:14.607 --> 41:16.404
Yey!

41:22.047 --> 41:24.880
lt's good doing this, in a way -

41:24.927 --> 41:26.963
takes your mind off the grief!

41:32.447 --> 41:37.362
Hey, no. Come on! Come on, love!

41:39.687 --> 41:42.326
Come on. Think about them two...

41:44.047 --> 41:46.959
..little Nigel and little Delia.

41:50.647 --> 41:57.439
lt's like the great cycle of life and death, innit?

41:57.487 --> 41:59.079
Yes.

42:02.727 --> 42:06.640
We're your family now, aren't we?

42:10.287 --> 42:13.723
lt's time l was...getting home.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.879
All right.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.123
- Whoa, whoa!
-This is chicken.

42:29.167 --> 42:31.476
- Anybody want...?
- There's some plates there.

42:31.527 --> 42:32.801
Spring rolls.

42:32.847 --> 42:36.237
Hey, Lip. Didn't you order some
chicken and black bean sauce...?

42:40.167 --> 42:43.364
- Juice, anybody?
- Yeah, thanks.

42:55.847 --> 42:57.280
My whole life...

42:57.327 --> 42:59.761
feels like all l've had is people letting me down.

42:59.807 --> 43:03.038
- Fiona, please...
- Let me finish.

43:04.127 --> 43:09.281
You say you love me,
and you want us to be together.

43:09.327 --> 43:10.396
l do.

43:10.447 --> 43:14.804
All l want is someone l can trust...

43:16.007 --> 43:18.646
..someone l can rely on.

43:18.687 --> 43:23.886
Because all the rest, Steve, it's just words.

44:39.807 --> 44:41.763
So that's a yes, then?

44:44.527 --> 44:46.483
l will not let you down.

45:00.487 --> 45:03.604
'That day, my mum's adage came back to me.

45:03.647 --> 45:08.402
'When l looked behind Steve's eyes,
all l saw was love.'

45:10.527 --> 45:14.486
l, Steve McBride, take thee, Fiona Gallagher

45:14.527 --> 45:16.358
to be my lawful wedded wife...

45:16.407 --> 45:18.602
- Congratulations..
- Yeah.

45:18.647 --> 45:19.284
Bastard!

45:19.327 --> 45:20.999
- You're not gay, are you?
- No.

45:21.047 --> 45:24.676
Wow! lf l stuck a bonnet on that,
it'd look like a microphone.

45:24.727 --> 45:28.845
lt's a happy day, starting a brand new life,
marrying Steve...

45:30.007 --> 45:30.837
Dead dog!

45:30.887 --> 45:34.323
'l'm not baby-sitting you all my life.'
Upstairs!

45:34.367 --> 45:36.927
Eugh! You scummy git!

45:36.967 --> 45:37.956
Fuck sake!

45:38.007 --> 45:38.803
'You can tell he knows.'

45:38.847 --> 45:43.398
l'm sick of that creep
getting everything his own way!
