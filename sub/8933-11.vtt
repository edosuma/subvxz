WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.235
This is the Evergreen

00:02.235 --> 00:03.503
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.438
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.276
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.678
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.213 --> 00:14.981
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:15.949 --> 00:16.950
Yikes!

00:17.717 --> 00:19.419
Yaaaah...

00:22.088 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.292
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.935
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.670 --> 00:38.805
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.542 --> 00:44.978
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.678 --> 00:47.247
the Raccoons!!

00:47.247 --> 00:50.116
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.828 --> 01:03.496
It's a busy
morning at the office

01:03.496 --> 01:05.231
of the Evergreen Standard.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.368
Everyone, as usual,
is hard at work preparing

01:08.368 --> 01:10.070
the latest edition of the newspaper.

01:11.171 --> 01:14.140
Ralph, I got those
shots of the old bandstand.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.176
Can you take a look
at this contact sheet?

01:16.176 --> 01:17.377
...and through the efforts

01:17.377 --> 01:20.346
of Lady Baden-Baden and
the Heritage Society

01:20.346 --> 01:22.715
the old bandstand
will soon be restored.

01:22.715 --> 01:25.318
Well, it's not exactly
earth shattering news,

01:25.318 --> 01:27.587
but Bert's written
a pretty good story.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.057
I thought before and
after photos of the bandstand

01:31.057 --> 01:32.725
might be a nice idea.

01:32.725 --> 01:36.062
But I'm not too happy
with these shots.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.130
Whatever
you think, Melissa.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.198
There's plenty of time.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.669
Evergreen
Standard, Ralph speaking.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.305
Yes.... mhm...

01:45.305 --> 01:47.440
You're kidding!

01:47.440 --> 01:50.410
No, no! That's terrific!

01:50.410 --> 01:51.678
Thanks for calling.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.481
Melissa, it's finally happened.

01:54.481 --> 01:58.118
The Civic Awards committee
has nominated me.

01:58.118 --> 02:02.288
Me, for Small Town
Editor of the Year Award.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.224
That's
wonderful, Ralph.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.625
There is
so much to get done.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.127
The committee is going
to be judging

02:07.127 --> 02:09.095
this issue of the Standard.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.799
We've got to make this the
best issue that ever saw print.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.935
In that case I'd
better re-shoot these photos!

02:15.935 --> 02:17.237
No, no, no!

02:17.237 --> 02:19.072
It's going to take
more than that, Melissa.

02:19.072 --> 02:22.275
We need hard hitting
investigative reporting.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.078
In depth features
on world events,

02:25.078 --> 02:28.748
I see.. uh, a
colour photo essays,

02:28.748 --> 02:31.151
computer control type setting.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.987
And where do
you see all this, Ralph?

02:33.987 --> 02:37.257
Right here, the new
Evergreen Standard!

02:37.257 --> 02:39.492
Bert, my star reporter,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.494
my ace news hound!

02:41.494 --> 02:43.630
Who?? Me?!

02:43.630 --> 02:45.565
What do you think of
the Standard's new slogan?

02:45.565 --> 02:49.102
'The Standard
sets the standard.'

02:49.102 --> 02:50.837
Well, I've heard better.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.172
I'll work on it.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.708
This year I'm going to win that
award no matter what it takes.

03:00.079 --> 03:03.516
Ace reporters don't stand around
waiting for news to happen, Bert

03:03.516 --> 03:04.717
so get out there, ace,

03:04.717 --> 03:06.686
and get me some late breaking,

03:06.686 --> 03:07.687
hard hitting,

03:07.687 --> 03:11.324
in depth, daring exposes!

03:11.324 --> 03:13.660
We need new typeface
a new masthead,

03:13.660 --> 03:16.696
better quality paper,
a whole new look!

03:21.134 --> 03:23.036
Unfair to Bears!

03:23.036 --> 03:25.505
Unfair to Bears!

03:25.505 --> 03:30.009
Cyril Sneer is unfair to Bears.

03:30.009 --> 03:34.214
Hey, I smell a late
breaking in depth,

03:34.214 --> 03:38.618
hard hitting,
daring expose here.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.920
Hey guys, what's the beef?

03:40.920 --> 03:42.488
O-oh!

03:42.488 --> 03:43.723
The Bears:

03:43.723 --> 03:46.659
Sneer is unfair to us...
he can't get away with that?

03:46.659 --> 03:49.062
No kidding!
Hey, let me get this down.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.396
The Bears:
...a seven day work week!

03:50.396 --> 03:53.299
What?!
A seven day work week?!?

03:53.299 --> 03:55.702
The Bears: No holidays ever!
What!? No holidays?!

03:55.702 --> 03:56.869
Ever?!

03:57.870 --> 04:00.673
I guess, this strike
has its good side too, Pop.

04:00.673 --> 04:03.176
After all, we don't
get too many chances

04:03.176 --> 04:04.978
to work together like this.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.746
We'll have
plenty of chances,

04:06.746 --> 04:09.215
because there is
plenty of work, my boy.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.884
Eh-eh-ehm!

04:11.884 --> 04:13.119
What do you want?

04:13.119 --> 04:15.488
Can't a man enjoy a
little peace and quiet

04:15.488 --> 04:17.490
in the sanctity of
his own vault?

04:17.490 --> 04:21.527
Sorry boss, but the help
is getting very restless.

04:21.527 --> 04:25.298
Pig 2: They're barely
under control, Sir.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.433
Pig 3: Don't you think we
should open negotiations

04:27.433 --> 04:29.035
right away, boss?

04:29.035 --> 04:31.104
Forget it!
But Sir,

04:31.104 --> 04:34.907
the Bears provide all
the cheap menial labour

04:34.907 --> 04:36.209
around the place.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.377
No problem!

04:37.377 --> 04:40.580
You menials are cheaper;
you can pick up the slack.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.349
Pig 1: That's what
we were afraid of.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.119
Look at the money I'll
save if I don't have to pay

04:46.119 --> 04:47.887
those brainless bruins.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.622
I don't know, Pop.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.624
It's a well
established fact that

04:51.624 --> 04:54.460
everybody loses during a strike.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.561
Nonsense!

04:55.561 --> 04:59.666
But boss, the press
is outside on the lawn.

04:59.666 --> 05:04.170
Pig 3: Yes, getting
the whole sordid story.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.407
Pig 2: Oh, think of
the bad publicity, boss.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.242
Who cares!

05:09.242 --> 05:12.812
There! I've done half
your work for you.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.249
Who says Cyril Sneer
isn't a sensitive employer?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.151
Now finish polishing the rest!

05:18.151 --> 05:20.153
Aww!

05:27.260 --> 05:28.428
Ready, Bert?

05:28.428 --> 05:30.630
Yup! Well, see you later.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.432
Cedric and I will
be back for dinner.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.800
Just a minute, Bert.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.968
I'm not happy with this at all.

05:35.968 --> 05:40.506
Well, gee, Ralph, you
always liked my columns before.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.842
I know, Bert, but
that was when you wrote

05:42.842 --> 05:44.143
for the old Standard.

05:44.143 --> 05:48.014
Remember, 'the new Standard
sets the standard.'

05:48.014 --> 05:51.718
Um.. What's
wrong with my story?

05:51.718 --> 05:54.921
It's too casual,
Bert, too off hand.

05:54.921 --> 05:58.124
I want the facts,
Bert, just the facts.

05:58.758 --> 06:02.829
I want more of what
makes news.. um.. news.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.864
Gee, I'm
sorry, Ralph.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.633
Maybe I did hurry it
a bit, you know,

06:07.633 --> 06:11.003
hey, but no problem, I'll
re-write it for you.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.038
Never mind, Bert.

06:13.072 --> 06:16.142
It's all a matter of style.
I know, what I want.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.478
We are on a tight schedule,
so I will re-write it.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.014
Egh! So,
I got no style, huh!

06:22.014 --> 06:25.551
Well, if that's the way you
feel, why don't you write

06:25.551 --> 06:28.121
all my columns
from now on, Ralph!

06:28.121 --> 06:30.857
Yeah! Come on Cedric, let's go!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.027
Uh, well,

06:35.027 --> 06:37.397
if you are going to put
out a better newspaper,

06:37.397 --> 06:41.501
we've all got to develop a
more professional attitude!

06:44.637 --> 06:46.572
Here, let me
help you, Ralph.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.408
And what about
those photos, Melissa?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.642
Are they finished yet?

06:49.642 --> 06:51.911
No, Sir Ralph!

06:51.911 --> 06:53.346
Sorry, Sir!

06:56.149 --> 06:58.151
I'll get right on it, Sir!

07:00.987 --> 07:04.023
Well, the boss may be
able to outlast this strike

07:04.023 --> 07:06.826
just fine, but we won't.

07:06.826 --> 07:10.663
Looks like the Bears are
holding out pretty well.

07:12.865 --> 07:17.937
Pig 2: This could be a
long, hard strike for us.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.375
Pig 3: Hey, it's the mailman.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.077
I got the mail yesterday.

07:25.077 --> 07:28.748
Ahh! Oooh! Aaaah!

07:30.183 --> 07:32.385
Special delivery?!

07:33.586 --> 07:36.589
Looks important.

07:36.589 --> 07:41.060
Pig 2: I'll say it is, just
wait till the boss sees this!

07:44.263 --> 07:46.466
B-boss! Boss!

07:46.466 --> 07:47.967
Can't you see
I'm on the phone?!

07:50.136 --> 07:53.539
Mr. Knox: As I was
saying, Mr. Sneer,

07:53.539 --> 07:56.976
my warmest congratulations.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.177
What for?

07:58.177 --> 08:00.913
Mr. Knox: Why, Sir,
haven't you heard?

08:00.913 --> 08:04.684
Why you've been nominated by
the Civic Awards Committee

08:04.684 --> 08:09.388
for Businessman of the Year.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.657
You mean,
after all these years,

08:11.657 --> 08:13.626
I've been nominated for...

08:13.626 --> 08:16.395
The Big Buck Award!

08:16.395 --> 08:19.599
Oops! (giggles) Oh!

08:19.599 --> 08:22.034
The Big
Buck Award?! Wow!

08:22.034 --> 08:24.103
Congratulations, Pop!

08:24.103 --> 08:28.174
Mr. Knox: Of course, I've
been nominated again

08:28.174 --> 08:32.512
and I intend
to win again.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.046
Forget it, Knox,

08:34.046 --> 08:36.349
three times in a row
is enough for anyone.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.583
It's my turn.

08:37.583 --> 08:42.288
The Bears:

08:42.288 --> 08:46.359
Mr. Knox: Mr. Sneer,
do my ears deceive me,

08:46.359 --> 08:51.430
or is that the cry of
dissatisfied employees?

08:51.430 --> 08:56.168
Tsk. Oh my,
I ask only because it

08:56.168 --> 08:59.372
may jeopardize your chances of

08:59.372 --> 09:03.476
winning The Big Buck Award.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.513
No, no, it's a pep rally.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.181
Good for employee morale!

09:09.181 --> 09:10.983
Mr. Knox: Well, for you sake,

09:10.983 --> 09:14.186
I hope, that's all it is.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.123
If the awards
committee finds out

09:17.123 --> 09:19.659
I've got a full blown
strike on my hands,

09:19.659 --> 09:22.828
I can kiss The Big
Buck Award goodbye.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.798
It will be front
page news tomorrow.

09:25.798 --> 09:29.535
Pig 2: That Raccoon wrote a
story about the strike.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.471
You're right! My
chances are ruined, for sure.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.140
I think
you should negotiate

09:34.140 --> 09:36.509
a new deal with the Bears, Pop.

09:36.509 --> 09:40.279
What?! And ruin my image
as a tough talking tycoon?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.548
I think it's
the only way, Pop,

09:42.548 --> 09:45.818
if you really want to win
that Big Buck Award.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.421
Of course I want
the Big Buck Award!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.122
Then leave it to us, Sir.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.824
When we are through
with the Bears,

09:51.824 --> 09:54.226
this strike will be old news.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.763
It better be,
or you will be pressed ham.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.931
Now get going!

10:02.368 --> 10:05.771
Uh huh,
ok, then... goodbye.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.574
That was the
ink company, Ralph.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.177
They can't get that
coloured ink in time.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.447
I'm afraid this issue will be
good old black and white.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.782
Oh great, just great!

10:16.782 --> 10:20.319
And I can't get this new type
setting computer working!

10:20.319 --> 10:22.421
How am I supposed to
win Editor of the Year,

10:22.421 --> 10:25.858
if I can't get this
paper out on time?

10:26.726 --> 10:31.230
Ouch! Why this week of all weeks

10:31.230 --> 10:33.899
does everything
have to go wrong?

10:33.899 --> 10:35.668
Ralph,
you're forgetting

10:35.668 --> 10:39.305
that the Standard was
nominated for what it is,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.741
not what you'd like it to be.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.409
Hi Ralph, Melissa.

10:43.409 --> 10:47.046
I called you two hours
ago to come and fix the press!

10:47.046 --> 10:48.280
Sorry, Ralph.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.217
What have you done
to the press?

10:51.217 --> 10:52.485
Improved it.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.754
Uh huh!
Looks like, I'll need

10:54.754 --> 10:57.556
a number six robertson
screwdriver for this job.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.091
I'll have to go get it.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.627
Great, first
Bert and now you!

11:01.627 --> 11:03.496
Look, just forget it, Schaeffer!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.064
I'll do it myself.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.767
I guess, I have to do
everything around here!

11:07.767 --> 11:08.834
Fine, Ralph.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.403
Let me know how you make out.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.805
Fine, great, no problem!

11:12.805 --> 11:16.776
Ralph Raccoon,
what has gotten into you?

11:16.776 --> 11:19.478
You can't treat your
friends that way just because

11:19.478 --> 11:21.614
you want to win
a newspaper award.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.949
Melissa,
I'm a professional.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.252
I've been nominated
Editor of the Year,

11:26.252 --> 11:28.120
and if I can't
depend on my staff

11:28.120 --> 11:31.824
to turn the Standard into the
best paper ever printed then...

11:31.824 --> 11:35.127
If you keep this up,
you won't have any staff!

11:35.127 --> 11:37.296
Have you got
those photos yet, Melissa,

11:37.296 --> 11:39.331
or do I have to do that, too?

11:39.331 --> 11:41.600
They are
in the camera, Ralph.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.803
I know, you want the
photos done properly,

11:43.803 --> 11:46.639
so you can develop
them yourself!

11:48.207 --> 11:50.543
Oh, Melissa, wait!

11:50.543 --> 11:52.878
Whoa! (bam!) Oh!

11:52.878 --> 11:55.881
All right then,
I will do it myself

11:55.881 --> 11:59.685
and it will be the best
issue of the Standard ever.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.522
Absurd! Impossible! Ridiculous!

12:03.522 --> 12:06.025
In other words, no way!

12:08.461 --> 12:11.731
Oooh! But it is
open to negotiation.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.336
Yes, boss. Yes?

12:17.336 --> 12:18.871
Mhmmm!

12:18.871 --> 12:22.274
Well, I think we've reached
a breakthrough, Sir.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.944
Well, hurry it up.
I want this mess settled

12:24.944 --> 12:26.979
before the Standard's
press deadline,

12:26.979 --> 12:28.347
whatever it takes!

12:29.315 --> 12:32.718
Whatever it takes? Hm..?

12:32.718 --> 12:37.056
Now, it's time to talk turkey.

12:37.056 --> 12:41.827
The Bears:
Gobble gobble gobble gobble!

12:41.827 --> 12:44.563
Pig 2: This may take
longer than we thought.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.533
Gee, what are
you guys doing here?

12:47.533 --> 12:50.202
I thought, you would be
down at the newspaper office.

12:50.202 --> 12:53.172
Ralph seems to want
to do all the work himself.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.541
The idea of winning
Editor of the Year

12:55.541 --> 12:57.309
has made him... well,

12:57.309 --> 13:00.012
a little hard to get along with.

13:00.012 --> 13:03.616
Yeah.
It's not like Ralph at all.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.552
Oh well, look
at the bright side.

13:06.552 --> 13:10.890
I've never seen Ralph so excited
about something in my life.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.193
Hey, he'll get the paper
finished on time.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.769
'Bears Bare Grudge.'

13:25.137 --> 13:27.506
Fine Ralph,
let me know how you make out.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.810
If you keep this up,
you won't have any staff!

13:30.810 --> 13:35.281
Gee, Ralph, you always
liked my columns before?

13:36.215 --> 13:37.716
You were right, Bert.

13:37.716 --> 13:41.120
It is a good story and it
should have been printed

13:41.120 --> 13:44.557
over an hour ago.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.459
Seven hours ago in London.

14:01.106 --> 14:02.641
Oh, still up, Pop?

14:02.641 --> 14:05.911
That contract should
have been settled hours ago.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.980
I don't know what's
holding them up.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.482
I'm sure, it will
work out. Good night, Pop.

14:10.482 --> 14:13.919
I can't take these
all-night bargaining sessions

14:13.919 --> 14:15.020
like I used to.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.764
Ugh?!

14:25.764 --> 14:28.934
Melissa, Schaeffer, wake up!

14:28.934 --> 14:31.036
Ralph's not home yet.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.838
I can't understand it.

14:32.838 --> 14:35.007
He should have been
home hours ago.

14:35.007 --> 14:37.676
I'm sure, there is
nothing to worry about, Melissa.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.678
He's probably
running a bit late.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.882
He is trying to put a
newspaper out all by himself.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.719
I guess so, Schaeffer,
but I've been thinking...

14:46.719 --> 14:49.188
maybe we were
a little hard on Ralph.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.624
You know, what winning
this award means to him.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.158
Ya, you're right.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.261
Let's go see
if he needs some help.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.730
I mean, we're
still a team right?

14:57.730 --> 14:58.831
Melissa/Schaeffer: Right!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.236
Poor Ralph.
And he wanted to win

15:04.236 --> 15:06.672
that award so badly.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.340
And look!

15:08.340 --> 15:10.409
The layouts aren't
even finished!

15:10.409 --> 15:12.511
Well, will
you look at this?

15:12.511 --> 15:15.147
Ralph put my story
about the Bears' strike

15:15.147 --> 15:16.715
in the paper after all.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.985
You know, I think, he was right.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.520
It isn't very good.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.824
Ralph
must be exhausted.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.329
Come on, gang!
We've got a paper to put out!

15:30.329 --> 15:35.834

Oh no!

16:35.794 --> 16:38.130
What are you doing
asleep on the job?

16:38.130 --> 16:41.033
That scandal sheet the
Raccoons call a newspaper

16:41.033 --> 16:43.135
has probably gone to press.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.670
Oh, he he he...

16:44.670 --> 16:48.841
Hi, boss, it was a
long night of bargaining, Sir,

16:48.841 --> 16:52.344
but against all odds, we did it.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.147
Pig 2: Ho-ho, we have a new
contract with the Bears,

16:55.147 --> 16:58.650
an enlightened document of
monumental proportions.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.853
a preponderance of...
Whatever!

17:00.853 --> 17:03.022
Quick, get this news
down to the Standard,

17:03.022 --> 17:04.857
before they print
the wrong story.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.363
Oh no, the paper!

17:11.363 --> 17:13.632
I must have slept right through.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.367
Don't worry, Ralphy boy,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.269
it's all under control.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.172
Care for a copy of
the early edition?

17:20.172 --> 17:24.443
You mean, you worked all
night after I was such a...

17:24.443 --> 17:26.478
...pain?
Tyrant?

17:26.478 --> 17:27.713
Ogre?

17:27.713 --> 17:31.650
Ya, I guess I was.
I'm sorry, gang.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.385
I wanted to win so badly,

17:33.385 --> 17:36.288
I guess, I let things
get carried away.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.158
Well, if all this
mushy stuff is finished,

17:39.158 --> 17:41.693
can we get these
papers delivered?

17:41.693 --> 17:43.962
You've got an award
to win, Ralph!

17:43.962 --> 17:47.733
We have an important
press release!

17:47.733 --> 17:50.969
Pig 2: Yes, vital
to the boss winning

17:50.969 --> 17:53.505
Businessman of the Year Award.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.742
Sorry, guys, maybe we'll
have room in the next issue.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.344
Pig 3: I can't bear to look.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.346
Pig 2: Oooh, the boss
isn't gonna like it,

18:01.346 --> 18:05.150
when he hears we
missed the deadline!

18:08.053 --> 18:11.590
Pig 3: Wait! I've got an idea!

18:13.659 --> 18:15.828
That's brilliant, Lloyd!

18:18.097 --> 18:19.832
Lady Baden-Baden: Ho-ho-ho!

18:19.832 --> 18:23.068
Welcome to the annual
Civic Awards night!

18:23.068 --> 18:24.503
And now our first award,

18:24.503 --> 18:30.042
The Big Buck Award, goes to
business man of the year.

18:30.042 --> 18:34.413
The winners of the Big Buck
must be outstanding

18:34.413 --> 18:39.218
and progressive in their
pursuit of better business.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.420
Why did I ever
let you drag me here?

18:41.420 --> 18:45.724
With that newspaper story about
the strike all over the place,

18:45.724 --> 18:47.860
I don't stand a chance.

18:47.860 --> 18:53.065
Ehm, actually we have
a surprise for you, boss.

18:53.065 --> 18:55.767
Pig 2: Ho-ho, we gave
the press release

18:55.767 --> 18:58.904
directly to the
awards committee.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.540
Pig 3: Now they know
all about the historic

19:01.540 --> 19:03.642
settlement with the Bears.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.878
You'll win the award for sure,

19:05.878 --> 19:08.247
newspaper story or not!

19:08.247 --> 19:10.449
You did?
Historic, you say?

19:10.449 --> 19:13.952
Great! Remind me to
give you boys a raise.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.955
Lady Baden-Baden:
And the winner, our new

19:16.955 --> 19:19.591
Businessman of the Year...

19:19.591 --> 19:21.693
Uh, hi-hi...

19:21.693 --> 19:26.765
Cyril Sneer!

19:26.765 --> 19:30.903
Hey, Knox... Pffttt!

19:30.903 --> 19:34.306
Lady Baden-Baden: Cyril Sneer
is this year's worthy recipient

19:34.306 --> 19:36.275
of The Big Buck Award

19:36.275 --> 19:39.912
because of his new
employee policies.

19:39.912 --> 19:45.184
Mr. Sneer has granted the
Bears a two day work week

19:45.184 --> 19:47.486
at double salary,

19:47.486 --> 19:50.455
their own in-ground
swimming pool,

19:50.455 --> 19:53.959
a three month paid
holiday each year,

19:53.959 --> 19:58.931
and breakfast in
bed every morning.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.799
Horraaaaayyyy!

20:00.799 --> 20:04.136
Way to go, Pop!
That's my Pop.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.272
Lady Baden-Baden: Would you care
to say a few words, Mr. Sneer?

20:07.272 --> 20:10.609
Well.. ahh... ummm.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.144
Lady Baden-Baden:
Thank you, Mr. Sneer.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.947
Certainly words to live by.

20:14.947 --> 20:19.284
Mr. Knox: Well,
congratulations, Mr. Sneer.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.987
You deserve it.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.426
You call that
negotiating?

20:27.426 --> 20:32.164
Oh but Sir, they
did drive a hard bargain.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.833
And I'll drive
you to the sausage factory!

20:34.833 --> 20:37.336
Lady Baden-Baden:
There are five nominees for

20:37.336 --> 20:39.972
Small Town Editor of the Year.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.907
Envelope please.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.712
And the winner, Ralph Raccoon

20:46.712 --> 20:49.248
of our very own
Evergreen Standard!

20:52.050 --> 20:53.819
Lady Baden-Baden:
Congratulations!

20:56.154 --> 20:57.522
Thank you,
Lady Baden-Baden.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.726
Ehm! Winning this award
tells us that our readers

21:00.726 --> 21:02.561
think we are doing a good job

21:02.561 --> 21:04.596
and that doesn't
mean just the editor.

21:04.596 --> 21:08.066
It's all of us, the team that
puts this paper together.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.435
We promise to keep
on doing our best,

21:10.435 --> 21:12.771
for everyone in the
Evergreen forest.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.039
Thank you all very much.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.281
Awards are a way of
recognizing the very best

21:22.281 --> 21:24.216
in different fields of endeavor.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.752
And in life, the highest award

21:26.752 --> 21:29.254
anyone can give or receive

21:29.254 --> 21:30.389
is friendship.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.728
But boss, do we have to?

21:36.728 --> 21:38.463
You negotiated the deal

21:38.463 --> 21:40.198
and you will live with it.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.733
Now get to work!

21:42.401 --> 21:44.536
Pig 2: All right,

21:44.536 --> 21:47.739
