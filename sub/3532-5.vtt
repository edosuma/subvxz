00:26.059 --> 00:28.789
- Burn them all.
- Kenny, what are you doing here?

00:28.962 --> 00:32.159
I need a tape recorder with a microphone.
I need to record something.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.232
I have a cracked version of Logic Pro 8-

00:34.400 --> 00:37.563
- I don't fucking care. Just set it up.
- Okay.

00:37.737 --> 00:40.433
I'm so glad you came over.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.303
Okay, so I can have the EQ optimized
for what you wanna do.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.569
I just need to know,
are you gonna be singing?

00:45.745 --> 00:47.872
I'm not gonna be fucking singing,
all right?

00:48.047 --> 00:50.413
I'm laying down my new audio book.

00:50.583 --> 00:54.383
No writing, just spoken words.
The old-fashioned way.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.988
There anything special
you want me to name the file?

00:57.157 --> 01:00.649
Name the file "Press record now
before I smash your fucking face in. "

01:00.827 --> 01:02.727
Okay. And we're rolling.

01:05.031 --> 01:10.663
When my ass was 34 years old,
I quit professional baseball.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.931
I haven't played professionally
for several years now...

01:15.108 --> 01:17.042
...but in my heart...

01:17.210 --> 01:19.610
...I quit for real this time.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.474
Tonight.

01:22.682 --> 01:25.913
It's time I accept the fact
that the glory days of my life...

01:26.085 --> 01:27.450
...are now behind me.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.456
Just like Neil Armstrong...

01:31.624 --> 01:36.357
...I went to space
and now I'm back and nobody gives a shit.

01:37.931 --> 01:43.233
Therefore,
I will now settle into this new life.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.804
I will find new ways
in which to use this arm.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.676
I will take my current responsibilities
seriously...

01:52.845 --> 01:56.611
...and try to do them
the best that I possibly can.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.583
And realizing that the love of my life
has chosen another...

02:01.688 --> 02:03.918
...I will move forward...

02:04.390 --> 02:06.119
...without her.

02:07.393 --> 02:10.384
I do all these things
not because I want to...

02:10.763 --> 02:12.856
...but because I have to.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.125
From this moment forward...

02:16.302 --> 02:20.500
...Kenny Powers is just like everyone else.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.705
Normal.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.276
Not special.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.643
No hopes.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.645
No dreams.

02:30.350 --> 02:35.049
Pretending to be happy
when he's really super sad.

02:35.755 --> 02:39.851
Just an average guy
with exceptional hair...

02:40.026 --> 02:43.359
...nothing more and nothing less.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.497
From this moment forward...

02:47.667 --> 02:49.862
...the people's champion...

02:50.336 --> 02:52.736
...the Shelby Sensation...

02:52.905 --> 02:54.873
...the Reverse Apache Master...

02:55.041 --> 02:57.009
...the man with the golden dick...

02:58.611 --> 03:01.045
...Dr. Cock 'n' Balls...

03:02.015 --> 03:04.381
...that Kenny Powers...

03:05.218 --> 03:07.345
...is now dead.

03:08.454 --> 03:12.015
And he will never pick up a baseball...

03:13.092 --> 03:17.290
...ever fucking again.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.870
Chapter two:

03:25.672 --> 03:27.606
"The Next Chapter. "

03:33.279 --> 03:34.871
Well, she's hot but she's a bitch.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.380
Yeah, but it looks like you got-
Gave her muscles.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.074
No, no, she ain't got no muscles.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.345
You should make this tit bigger
than that one.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.954
No, that's- That's- That's-

03:43.122 --> 03:46.888
- Excuse me. Dusty Powers?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.655
Why is this indigo tile darker
than the indigo tile that I ordered?

03:50.830 --> 03:53.594
Darker?
I ordered the product number you gave me.

03:54.434 --> 03:59.633
So this tile right here
looks just like what we ordered?

04:00.306 --> 04:03.901
- Yeah, it-
- Are you retarded? Are you stupid?

04:04.077 --> 04:08.571
Are you-? Are you an idiot?
What the fuck are you staring at me for?

04:09.749 --> 04:13.810
Listen, Dusty, I flip houses for a living.

04:13.986 --> 04:18.719
They are going to do a reality show on me
once the market, you know...

04:18.891 --> 04:21.485
- But anyway, I use a very specific-
- Sorry about that.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.027
- What?
- I said, I'm sorry about that, the show.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.858
Are you smart-mouthing me?

04:26.032 --> 04:29.866
No. That- He- I'm sorry too.
A reality show would be really cool for you.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.096
How am I gonna take care of this?
Know how much this is gonna cost?

04:33.272 --> 04:34.569
Yes, ma'am.

04:34.741 --> 04:38.802
I'll accept full responsibility
and cover any cost on the tile.

04:38.978 --> 04:42.004
How am I supposed to flip this thing
if I have the wrong tile?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.741
You gave me a product number,
and that's what I ordered.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.215
- That's Aubergine-
- Sorry, I have to take this.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.220
Sure. Aubergine 316.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.721
Kenny Powers, can I help you?

04:51.891 --> 04:55.588
- What's up, dawg?
- Goddamn it, this isn't a good time now.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.786
Oh, really?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.454
I thought it was always a good time
to get rich.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.897
- What are you talking about?
- Got a call from Ashley Schaeffer today...

05:03.069 --> 05:05.094
...and he was talking big money, Kenny.

05:05.271 --> 05:09.469
I'm talking $500, half of that in cash...

05:09.642 --> 05:12.543
...half of it in coupons
to local businesses, baby.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.475
Cancel it. I'm not interested.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.808
Okay, well,
he thought you would say that...

05:16.983 --> 05:19.508
...and wanted me to tell you
he has security footage...

05:19.685 --> 05:23.416
...of you throwing that cinder block
through that BMW window.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.581
Okay, on second thought,
tell him I will take that meeting...

05:26.759 --> 05:29.523
...but make sure he knows
I'm not coming there for business.

05:29.695 --> 05:33.461
I'm coming there as Kenny Powers the man,
not the legend, the one he's pissed at.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.533
Okay. Good strategy, Kenny.

05:35.701 --> 05:38.261
I appreciate you picking up
when I called too.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.433
Kenny?

05:47.346 --> 05:49.644
Wow, pretty impressive.

05:49.816 --> 05:53.013
Too bad all these people showed up
to see a man who no longer exists.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.212
- Don't be afraid to look at the cars.
- Oh, shit.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.050
- There you go.
- Who's Reg Mackworthy?

05:58.224 --> 06:00.283
My arch fucking nemesis.
Come on, let's bolt.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.397
There he is, the man with the golden arm.
Kenny Powers, how the hell are you?

06:05.565 --> 06:08.363
Schaeffer, you asshole.
What is all this shit? You set me up.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.697
Hey. Kenny Powers. How's it going, man?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.931
- Pretty good until I saw your black ass.
- Oh, now.

06:15.107 --> 06:17.371
It's been a long time
since I've seen you around.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.671
Matter of fact, last time I saw you,
I ended your career.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.439
- Oh, yeah.
- No, you didn't.

06:22.615 --> 06:25.982
I ended my career myself a week ago,
on my own.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.882
Oh, so you double-retired?

06:29.822 --> 06:32.757
Can you feel the tension? I can.

06:32.925 --> 06:37.953
I can feel it down in my plums.
They're getting a nice bluish hue.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.394
Getting ready to take them
to the farmers' market.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.966
If I recall correctly,
the last time you guys met...

06:43.135 --> 06:44.602
...one of you hit a grand slam.

06:44.770 --> 06:48.331
The other one
walked out of baseball forever.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.272
And now here you are, reunited.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.607
- It's like a goddamn Greek tragedy.
- What you talking about, Ash?

06:54.780 --> 06:58.739
Some sort of pitching competition,
some shit straight out of The Natural:

06:58.918 --> 07:02.513
Whammer and Hobbs,
right here, right now.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.280
- Ashley Schaeffer BMW.
- Hell, yeah.

07:04.457 --> 07:08.894
Ashley Schaeffer BMW.
Ashley Schaeffer BMW.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.493
No, there's not gonna be
any goddamn face-off, all right?

07:12.665 --> 07:15.793
I've quit baseball.
I've retired, put that behind me.

07:15.968 --> 07:19.335
I'm just a regular American,
just like the rest of y'all.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.802
So no pitching.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.238
Throw the ball,
I knock it out of the dealership.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.379
- Everybody's happy.
- Give them a show, Powers.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.447
Yeah! Burn his ass, Kenny.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.277
Kenny Powers' days
of burning ass are done.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.419
And that's not a homosexual reference.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.918
I made a promise to myself...

07:36.088 --> 07:38.716
...and I'm not gonna break it
for the sake of capitalism.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.883
- So sorry.
- Come on.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.528
Kenny. Hey, hold on, man.

07:44.997 --> 07:49.525
I know where you at, man.
You had it all, and now it's gone.

07:50.102 --> 07:53.833
It's torn a hole in your soul
bigger than my Escalade.

07:54.006 --> 08:00.172
So you turn to the drugs, the alcohol,
the pornography...

08:00.346 --> 08:02.940
...freebasing with O. J...

08:03.115 --> 08:05.242
...human trafficking...

08:05.418 --> 08:08.546
...dogfights-slash-orgies...

08:08.721 --> 08:09.779
...darkness.

08:10.222 --> 08:15.125
Let me tell you something as a man who's
come through the dark and into the light.

08:15.294 --> 08:19.628
I can assure you that the will of the Lord
is not limited to just me.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.029
If you need me, I'm here for you.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.761
Not just as a friend...

08:24.937 --> 08:26.336
...as a brother in Christ.

08:28.407 --> 08:32.844
That's his enemy. His enemy.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.741
And that's the compassion
he shows for him.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.475
The man you're trying to save is dead.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.744
You're wasting your time.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.789
You're a good man, Kenny Powers.
God loves you.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.426
- He's gotta open his heart.
- No, thanks.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.294
That was amazing.
You gotta make a tape series out of that.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.865
If you need financing for that,
you tell me.

08:58.170 --> 09:02.436
Stevie, this new direction
my life is taking me is really-

09:02.608 --> 09:03.700
It's got me thinking.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.237
- About what?
- About me and you.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.436
Really? I like that.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.706
Like, in a good way,
you're thinking about us?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.042
I wouldn't say that.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.250
I think I'm gonna have to let you go.

09:16.355 --> 09:20.291
Kenny, don't do this, okay?
This isn't happening.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.257
The important thing is for you to know
this isn't your fault.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.260
This is not about you, it's about me.

09:25.431 --> 09:29.629
It's all an extension of me finally realizing
I'm not the man I thought I was...

09:29.802 --> 09:31.736
...and just kind of moving on from there.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.805
Okay. Fine.

09:35.374 --> 09:40.471
I am not your assistant anymore.
I will just be your friend.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.410
I wish it was that easy,
but if we were to hang out again...

09:43.582 --> 09:46.676
...I would just constantly be tempted
to get you to do shit for me.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.376
I'd have to fight that real hard.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.148
Right now that's a battle
I don't think I can win.

09:51.323 --> 09:53.917
I hope we get in a car wreck
right now, I do.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.585
I hope we get in a fucking car wreck.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.895
A motherfucking car wreck,
and we both die...

10:01.067 --> 10:03.297
...and then we can live in heaven.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.597
I'm not gonna get into a car wreck,
because I'm an excellent driver.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.468
You're excellent at everything.
I fucking hate it.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.873
I think maybe we should just sit here
quietly now, not say anything...

10:13.045 --> 10:16.173
...and let you just contemplate
on the news I just dropped on you...

10:16.348 --> 10:20.011
...and let me kind of just contemplate
on my own pains and sorrows right now...

10:20.186 --> 10:22.984
...perhaps while I listen to this music.

10:46.545 --> 10:50.072
- Enjoy your books.
- I will. I appreciate it.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.678
- Hey, Kenny.
- Hey, how's it going, April?

10:53.853 --> 10:56.515
- You got glasses.
- Yeah.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.088
They make you look different.

10:58.257 --> 11:01.715
Yeah, well, they're not real.
I just figured I might as well look the part.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.020
The part of what?

11:03.195 --> 11:06.824
Just a normal, regular teacher
with no hopes or dreams...

11:06.999 --> 11:10.366
...absolutely nothing, just waiting to die.

11:10.536 --> 11:14.734
- Just like you guys.
- Hey, listen.

11:14.907 --> 11:19.037
We haven't had a chance to talk
about what happened at the whole cookout.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.235
No reason to.

11:20.412 --> 11:23.848
A lot's changed since then,
so we don't really need to rehash all that.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.041
I just want you to know
I'm not mad at you.

11:26.218 --> 11:30.245
April, stopping that night when I did,
that was the right thing to do.

11:30.422 --> 11:32.481
- I realize that now.
- You didn't really stop.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.387
I did. I made a moral choice, April.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.187
- But you didn't really stop.
- I did.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.458
- I stopped us before things got out of hand.
- A lot of men do what you did, so-

11:40.633 --> 11:43.534
- Make moral decisions?
- Fuck you, bitch!

11:43.702 --> 11:46.899
Girls! Girls!

11:47.072 --> 11:49.734
Enough. Right now. Enough.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.776
Hey. Hey. Chill, chill, chill.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.539
You do not hit a fucking lady,
do you hear me?

11:55.714 --> 11:58.581
- Now apologize to Miss Buchanon.
- Sorry.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.879
You wanna fight, do it on your own time,
in a parking lot somewhere.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.045
Not in a school, surrounded by books.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.325
You okay?

12:07.693 --> 12:09.593
Where'd they get you?

12:09.762 --> 12:10.786
By the mouth.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.828
- Right here.
- Right there?

12:13.999 --> 12:16.661
Oh, my God, April, what happened here?
Are you all right?

12:16.836 --> 12:17.860
- No.
- Oh, no.

12:18.037 --> 12:21.404
- Yeah, those bitches hit her in the face.
- Those are students, so...

12:21.574 --> 12:23.508
She's in your hands now.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.410
- So treat her right.
- Okay, I will, Kenny. Thanks.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.549
She's a princess.
She deserves to be treated like one.

12:30.716 --> 12:34.117
Oh, of course.
I understand that. Yes. Yep.

12:34.286 --> 12:38.655
You gotta respect her mind
just as much as her body.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.759
Oh, yeah. Well, I can do that.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.191
I appreciate this talk. That's great.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.830
- You'd better remember it.
- Yeah.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.023
Because I won't repeat it.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.291
What...?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.300
What's happening right now?

13:00.746 --> 13:02.976
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately...

13:03.148 --> 13:07.847
...about how, basically, I'm in the autumn
of my life and it's high time to get serious.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.920
This may sound crazy...

13:10.089 --> 13:13.217
...but maybe it's time me and you
take this thing to the next level.

13:13.392 --> 13:17.829
Settle down. Who knows?
Maybe even have a kid.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.298
I got a kid.

13:20.766 --> 13:22.734
- You have a kid?
- I got two kids.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.400
I got Kendra and I got...

13:26.205 --> 13:29.299
I got Efrain. Fuck, my pussy itches.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.710
Let's put a pin in this, shall we?

13:32.177 --> 13:36.580
Just- We'll just-
We'll come back to this, okay?

13:37.249 --> 13:41.618
- SoCo?
- No. A warm glass of wine.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.714
- We don't have wine here.
- Clegg here?

13:45.257 --> 13:48.420
- The fuck do you want?
- You Clegg?

13:50.229 --> 13:51.662
Maybe.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.993
Then again, maybe not.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.570
I will fuck you up, motherfucker.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.299
That's not what I was insinuating
by my body language.

14:03.475 --> 14:08.139
I was just saying,
welcome to Shh-Boom Shh-Booms.

14:08.314 --> 14:12.512
Now, look,
whichever of you two faggots is Clegg...

14:12.685 --> 14:13.709
...I got the money.

14:13.886 --> 14:17.287
- Oh, wait, you're the bodyguard.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.616
- Bodyguard.
- Listen, now.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.816
Can we take care of this shit out back?

14:20.993 --> 14:25.987
- This bar smells like an old lady farted piss.
- That's gross.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.759
Hey, just out of curiosity...

14:28.934 --> 14:31.300
...whose body needs a dude like you
to guard it?

14:33.605 --> 14:37.268
Well, lookie here.
Mr. I-Done-Turned-My-Life-Around.

14:37.443 --> 14:41.243
I thought you were Christian now.
What the hell are you doing buying cocaine?

14:41.413 --> 14:43.779
Fuck all that bullshit.
That's just theatrics.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.850
People don't wanna see
a washed-up party animal.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.214
They want a story about redemption.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.356
I knew you were working
some kind of angle.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.959
You're goddamn right. Near lost my money
after the league kicked me out...

14:55.127 --> 14:57.960
...for them bullshit-ass gambling charges.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.928
My paper looking real good nowadays.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.863
You know what I'm saying?

15:03.035 --> 15:05.333
Hell, Ashley gave me 10 grand.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.473
- Ashley Schaeffer paid you $10,000?
- Yeah, nigga.

15:08.974 --> 15:09.998
That's cool.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.837
I'm not into whoring myself out for money.
That's just me.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.673
Well, I'm happy for you, Kenny, man.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.680
Apparently you got over
all this baseball shit, man.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.115
Good for you.
Looks like you turned over a new leaf.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.987
I did. You should try it sometime.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.987
Let me ask you one question, though.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.217
When did you become...

15:28.761 --> 15:30.456
...such a pussy?

15:30.629 --> 15:34.087
Like, I mean, you was always, like, a pussy,
don't get me wrong.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.734
But now you're just like a vagina
with a mullet...

15:36.902 --> 15:39.666
...just walking around this motherfucker.

15:39.838 --> 15:43.501
Forecast is for snow treats.
Let's roll, baby.

15:43.675 --> 15:46.508
Yeah, let's get the fuck up out of here.

15:46.678 --> 15:50.944
Oh, by the way, I'm signing autographs
at the dealership all week...

15:51.116 --> 15:53.641
...so come on down
if you decide to grow a pair.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.486
Or if you just want an autograph.
I'll sign you something.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.084
Let's go.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.659
Peace.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.297
Peace, pussy.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.968
I think it's coming along pretty good.
What do you think?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.006
Yeah, it looks pretty awesome.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.736
All right, down here
at Ashley Schaeffer BMW all day...

16:21.914 --> 16:24.348
...where prices are being slashed
all over the place.

16:24.516 --> 16:28.384
If that's not enough,
this is the last day we got Reg Mackworthy.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.648
So bring your butts on down
to Ashley Schaeffer BMW.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.485
Outstanding. Reg, I heard a rumor...

16:33.659 --> 16:36.127
...about some pitch-off
between you and Kenny Powers.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.785
The rumors are just rumors, man.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.295
We asked Kenny to come down,
help me with a demo...

16:40.466 --> 16:45.233
...but, you know, let's just say
Kenny Powers is crippled by fear.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.304
- It's cool.
- No. No, negatory there, Javier.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.572
El "pository," Javier. Keep it on.

16:55.747 --> 16:59.547
Don't turn that shit off on account of me.
I don't care what they're saying.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.845
- What's this about a pitch-off?
- Nothing.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.021
You know,
just something from my old life.

17:05.190 --> 17:09.023
But I don't compete anymore.
Just not gonna do it.

17:09.428 --> 17:13.022
I'm just like you now, Dustin,
just kind of calm and weak.

17:14.299 --> 17:18.201
You think I like busting my back and
taking shit from rich motherfuckers all day?

17:18.369 --> 17:21.066
- Because I don't.
- Can we please just drop this?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.835
- I'm trying to move on.
- Move on? Move on to what, Kenny?

17:25.010 --> 17:30.380
- Teaching school?
- Well, if it isn't Ass and Wipe.

17:30.549 --> 17:36.044
Can one of you pig-fuckers please tell me
why I'm looking at two-by-fours...

17:36.221 --> 17:38.086
...instead of paint and trim?

17:38.257 --> 17:43.126
Must I remind you to stop messing around?
This isn't Dollywood.

17:43.795 --> 17:46.263
I believe the reason
you're looking at two-by-fours...

17:46.431 --> 17:47.898
...is because of fuck you.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.836
- You can't talk like that.
- I'll talk any way I want.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.497
Want that job done faster?
Do it your fucking self. We're leaving.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.307
- What about my sunroom?
- Fuck your fucking sunroom.

17:59.478 --> 18:03.073
Javier, Tom, no mรกs tomorrow.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.642
Where do you think you're going?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.684
Ashley Schaeffer fucking BMW.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.289
Whoa, whoa, we're going...?

18:12.457 --> 18:13.788
Come on, Kenny. All right?

18:13.959 --> 18:16.587
- To BMW?
- Hell, yeah, let's go.

18:16.762 --> 18:20.289
- Hey. Hey.
- "Hey" nothing, you city bitch.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.092
Fucking rednecks.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.293
I'm tired of having to correct
you guys' mistakes.

18:25.470 --> 18:29.839
Did you guys not get that memo?
Yeah, I said no fucking clowns.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.374
Fuck, everyone's here.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.872
Oh, shit. I can't do this.
I'm about to have a fucking panic attack.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.915
- I need four Xanax and two Miller Lites.
- No, you can do this.

18:39.084 --> 18:43.578
Listen, you haven't seen my pitch. I have.
My pitch fucking blows, okay?

18:43.755 --> 18:45.985
- I'm gonna get killed.
- No, listen.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.318
- Lookie here.
- Hold on.

18:47.492 --> 18:50.017
Look whose mama let him come out
and play today.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.186
Well, well, well.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.800
The former star decides to take once more
to the sky.

18:55.968 --> 19:00.029
Shut the fuck up, Ashley.
This isn't about you. It's about me and him.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.572
It's always been about me, Kenny,
your entire career.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.972
It would be my honor to end it twice.

19:06.144 --> 19:08.612
- Look him in the eye.
- Oh, I'm looking him in his eye.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.078
- It's all in the eyes. Don't blink.
- What you got?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.218
- Stone-cold.
- Yeah, they are.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.613
Piercing through your ass.

19:14.786 --> 19:18.517
This is what I'm talking about,
a fucking showdown.

19:18.690 --> 19:22.148
Potential Ashley Schaeffer BMW buyers,
is that what you want?

19:23.328 --> 19:24.352
Is that what you want?

19:24.529 --> 19:27.692
- I don't cry, motherfucker.
- Let me tell you something.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.460
I had a dream about this moment...

19:30.636 --> 19:34.697
...when I was making love
to my wife, Darla...

19:34.873 --> 19:36.898
...on top of her...

19:37.075 --> 19:41.910
...powerful thrusts
filling the sultry night air.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.241
Heavy breath.

19:44.416 --> 19:48.477
My son Gabriel walked in. Little boy.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.918
My wife sprung out of bed, said,
"Gabriel, leave. "

19:51.089 --> 19:54.684
I said, "No, honey.
Shut your mouth. Let him watch.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.987
Let him watch
what is being consecrated here. "

19:57.162 --> 20:00.290
And I want the people to watch
what's gonna be consecrated here.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.901
And I will bring my son down here
and he will watch.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.903
He will watch you two battle it here...

20:08.073 --> 20:10.871
...you two becoming one.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.670
Okay?

20:14.313 --> 20:15.712
This isn't a game anymore.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.573
- This isn't a game.
- You sure you wanna do this?

20:20.252 --> 20:22.686
Whatever needs to be set up
for a pitching contest...

20:22.854 --> 20:25.084
...set that shit up.

20:27.659 --> 20:30.890
The rumors are true. In one hour,
Reg Mackworthy will be facing off...

20:31.063 --> 20:33.054
...against Shelby's bad boy,
Kenny Powers...

20:33.231 --> 20:35.756
...right here at the one and only
Ashley Schaeffer BMW.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.697
Slap those saddles. Get on down here.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.734
- You're listening to 103.5.
- Get my ears.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.936
Oh, boy, that B12 shot is really kicking in
right about now.

20:43.108 --> 20:46.009
I just feel loose and limber.
I feel like Superman.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.907
- Well, you're gonna be great.
- I know.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.139
- I'm the only real athlete here.
- Well...

20:50.315 --> 20:52.681
So glad I shaved down.
That was a good move, right?

20:52.851 --> 20:55.285
- Me too. I'm glad too.
- Yeah, well...

20:56.855 --> 20:59.119
Well, I will see you in an hour 12.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.883
- All right.
- Maybe an hour 11.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.993
- Okay, good luck.
- Okay, goodbye.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.685
I'm not gonna need it.

21:04.863 --> 21:08.526
Competitors, take your starting positions.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.565
On your mark.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.363
- Get set.
- You ready?

21:12.537 --> 21:14.334
- Go.
- Now.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.190
- How much you putting down?
- Reg. Reg all the way.

21:36.661 --> 21:38.561
You get those fucking 'roids?

21:38.730 --> 21:42.461
No, but I got something a little better.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.831
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense.
I got a fucking duel to go to.

21:46.004 --> 21:49.906
Just a little piece of heaven
I like to call OxyContin.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.066
- Clegg, OxyContin?
- Yeah.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.975
Man, I'm not trying to get fucked up.
I'm trying to strike this motherfucker out.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.480
Well, man,
that shit's hard to get on short notice.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.050
- Know what? Fuck this.
- Clegg, wait.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.653
I didn't mean I didn't want some for later.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.123
Think it'll keep fresh in my sock?

22:10.295 --> 22:12.855
- I don't know. Do you get sweaty?
- Sometimes.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.089
Kenny.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.564
- You came back for me.
- No.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.207
I never really left.

22:24.042 --> 22:27.944
It's illegal. We shouldn't have it just out.
But thank you.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.378
What a great day to be here, huh?

22:32.551 --> 22:36.510
Come on, everyone, I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

22:36.688 --> 22:41.216
Shut up. Okay, shut up.
Shut up, I'm in control. I'm in control.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.453
Let me explain what's going on.
This is a contest of skill.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.894
Sixty feet 6 inches
from the rubber mound...

22:48.066 --> 22:51.194
...all the way to the plate there, okay?

22:51.369 --> 22:54.099
One at bat. Three strikes, four balls.

22:54.606 --> 22:58.599
- Hey, no bunts. No bunting.
- Nobody gonna bunt.

22:59.478 --> 23:02.845
- I'm gonna knock it to the fucking moon.
- Yeah, you got this, baby.

23:03.014 --> 23:07.144
If Powers strikes him out,
then 40 percent off a pre-owned BMW.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.287
- How does that sound?
- Forty percent.

23:09.454 --> 23:12.582
You're gonna have to pay 40 percent, man,
40 percent.

23:12.757 --> 23:14.918
If Mackworthy knocks it out of the lot...

23:15.093 --> 23:19.860
...then the same everyday Ashley Schaeffer
BMW famous low prices, okay?

23:20.031 --> 23:23.262
Either way, you're a winner.
Either way, you're a winner.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.335
I'm losing money right now.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.199
So, what are they doing?

23:27.372 --> 23:29.738
- It's a pitch-off.
- What's that mean?

23:29.908 --> 23:32.035
Kenny gets a second chance
to smoke this prick.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.371
Let's get this thing going. Come on.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.278
Lord, give me the strength
to knock the demons out of that ball.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.282
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.080
Come on, Kenny.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.089
All right, Kenny!

23:49.528 --> 23:51.826
Come on, Kenny. Go, Kenny.

23:53.465 --> 23:56.764
Hey, hey, hey.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.307
Hey, Powers, you know I'm the one
you're supposed to throw it to, right?

24:05.844 --> 24:08.642
- Right here, come on.
- Good luck, Kenny.

24:08.813 --> 24:11.213
I feel 10 feet tall right now...

24:12.050 --> 24:14.314
...and strong as an ox.

24:14.486 --> 24:18.388
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey, who the fuck are you?

24:19.424 --> 24:22.757
- Who the fuck are you?
- Okay, I like it. All right.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.486
Keep it down, man.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.395
Come on, Kenny.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.473
Hey.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.337
Come on, you sack of shit.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.710
Throw him something
he's got an honest chance of hitting.

24:45.884 --> 24:48.114
Unless maybe you can't anymore.
That's my game.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.753
Dick-slapping's my game.

24:50.488 --> 24:53.787
It's all right, everyone. Come on.
It's all right. Here we go.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.218
Sorry about that, Reg.

24:57.596 --> 25:01.498
Trash it out. Here we go, Kenny.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.499
- You came.
- Here we go, Kenny, here we go.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.364
I heard it on the radio.

25:07.138 --> 25:11.404
- So does this mean...?
- Here we go, Kenny, here we go.

25:11.576 --> 25:14.136
I just want you to know
that I've been thinking a lot...

25:14.312 --> 25:17.179
...about, you know,
what happened at the cookout.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.874
Can we talk about it later,
when everyone's not around?

25:20.051 --> 25:22.519
We were there,
and then we were touching each other...

25:22.687 --> 25:25.349
...and I saw those tits
and I started feeling your ass...

25:25.523 --> 25:28.287
...and I started breathing heavy
and almost got a headache.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.156
Then my vision started to go all colorful.

25:31.329 --> 25:35.026
- Then I just came in my pants.
- Okay.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.392
But I won't do that again.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.903
Can we finish this or are you just gonna
yackety-yak with Tits-And-Legs?

25:42.073 --> 25:45.668
Hey, she's more than a pair of tits
with legs, Mackworthy.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.779
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, maybe after I hit this shit to Beijing...

25:48.947 --> 25:50.972
- Yeah.
-... I'll see what else she got.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.982
- Yeah, that's right.
- And I'll show you how a real man comes.

25:54.919 --> 25:57.080
You premature ejaculator.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.584
Throw the fucking ball, man.

25:59.758 --> 26:02.591
Let's go. Bang on.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.262
Come on, Kenny, strike his ass out.

26:13.805 --> 26:17.400
I want it. I need it.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.990
One hundred and one.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.797
God, help him.

26:43.968 --> 26:46.937
- Motherfucker.
- You okay, Mackworthy?

26:49.274 --> 26:51.435
You knocked his fucking eye out.

26:52.844 --> 26:56.041
You're goddamn right I did.
I was aiming for his fucking eye.

26:56.214 --> 26:59.115
- I got my pitch back.
- Yeah!

26:59.284 --> 27:00.683
Goddamn deal's off.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.187
No discount on account of tragedy.
No discount.

27:04.355 --> 27:06.755
Get paper towels
and ice from the snow-cone machine.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.519
- Clean that eye up.
- Schaeffer! Suck a fat one!

27:12.197 --> 27:13.221
Fuck you.
