00:00.568 --> 00:03.202
Hello? Is someone up there?

00:04.638 --> 00:09.008
She had actually had an
attachment go home with her.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.044
You can start
the conversation, if you want.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.345
"This moment...

00:14.749 --> 00:15.447
is dead."

00:17.752 --> 00:19.184
He comes into this space.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.186
-[Adam] "He?"
-He.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.756
Do you ever come
inside this theater?

00:23.758 --> 00:26.025
"They burned... me."

00:26.961 --> 00:28.694
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:28.696 --> 00:30.062
We just want
to help this family.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.430
<i> [Adam] The living</i>
<i>  need our help.</i>

00:31.432 --> 00:32.898
Have you always been here?

00:32.900 --> 00:34.199
He was watching already.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.717
[Adam] The Rialto Theatre.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.987
I get the feeling that
everyone in this town

00:54.989 --> 00:57.089
already knows we're here.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.794
Casey, the woman
who called us,

01:01.796 --> 01:04.763
she said they've had
instances of a shadow figure,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.231
like. running at people.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.666
Yeah, that's weird.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.969
I know that there's
two entities that they're
terrified of.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.871
One's in the orchestra
and one's in the mezzanine.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.005
And the one in the orchestra

01:14.007 --> 01:16.408
literally followed somebody
home and attacked them.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.678
<i> [Amy] Like, it seems like</i>
<i>  really aggressive activity</i>

01:19.680 --> 01:20.679
-for a theater to me.
-Yeah.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.781
I mean, we've investigated
theaters before.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.885
And we know, there's a lot
of emotion involved
in theaters

01:26.887 --> 01:30.522
and sometimes spirits are
either attracted to them or...

01:30.524 --> 01:32.057
they create them.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.627
There's definitely something
to be said for the energy

01:35.629 --> 01:38.130
exchange in theater
between the living...

01:38.699 --> 01:39.765
-Mm-hmm.
-...and the dead, so...

01:39.767 --> 01:41.400
This whole town
feels a little...

01:41.402 --> 01:43.202
-spooky.
-I know, like, weird.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.876
-[Adam] Casey?
-Yes.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.578
-Hi, I'm Adam.
-[Casey] Hi, Adam.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.680
[Adam and Casey]
Nice to meet you.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.849
-Hi, Casey. I'm Amy.
Good to meet you.
-[Casey] Nice to meet you too.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.918
I mean, this place
is incredible, Casey.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.687
[Amy] Now, how
old is this place?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.822
[Casey] It's over
a hundred years old.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.959
[Amy] So, a lot
of history here, obviously.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.794
It's been around
for a long time.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.430
What's going on here
that you need our help?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.765
We have a lot of disturbances.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.935
Noises, things looking
like they're being thrown.

02:16.937 --> 02:20.839
Uh, people seeing a black
shadow in several areas.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.208
Doors being
slammed in our faces.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.610
So, that sounds
pretty nonstop.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.078
Right.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.814
We call this corner over
here The Hecklers' Corner.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.382
[Amy] Okay.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.918
And that's because there's
noises that come from there.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.189
-Pops, bangs and laughing
and coughing.
-[Amy] Hmm.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.725
And then, up in the balcony,

02:39.727 --> 02:43.829
there's something up there
that kinda follows you around.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.365
-[Amy] Oh. Oh, jeez!
-You just feel like
it's gonna push you off.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.901
-Oh, God! That's not okay.
-[Amy] Okay. That's scary.

02:48.903 --> 02:52.004
What about somebody experience
something that followed
them home?

02:52.006 --> 02:53.038
-What is that about?
-[Casey] Yes.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.842
One of the ghost hunter groups
that we have,

02:56.844 --> 03:00.812
the female actually had
an attachment go
home with her.

03:00.814 --> 03:04.483
It was very...
very violent with her.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.085
And she is sure that
it came from this space?

03:07.087 --> 03:09.488
This was the last place
that they had left

03:09.490 --> 03:11.123
before all this happened.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.060
[Amy] Do you know of any
deaths or tragedies that

03:15.062 --> 03:17.729
happened in the building
that could lead to a haunting?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.598
Not in the building.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.801
Back behind the building,
back in the '30s,

03:22.803 --> 03:24.770
they called that
alley "Death Alley."

03:24.772 --> 03:25.971
[Adam] Hmm.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.708
And there were rumored to
be some murders that happened.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.877
-Wow! That's interesting.
-Okay.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.378
-[Amy] Okay,
let's look into that.
-Yeah.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.881
[Amy] Where should we go next?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.350
Okay, let's go to
the dressing rooms.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.219
[Amy] All right,
dressing rooms.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.257
-[Casey] This is the Queen's,
or the women's dressing room.
-[Amy] Okay.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.892
So what happens in here?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.393
[Casey] I was in
the shower one day.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.429
Door was locked.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.164
Nobody else the building.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.967
-The door kind of... jiggled.
-[Adam] Mm-hmm.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.969
And came open.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.503
So, I got out of the shower.

03:58.505 --> 04:02.774
I went up to the front
and there was nobody around.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.844
-So, there was nobody else.
-That's one time you don't
want a ghost around,

04:05.846 --> 04:08.413
-is when you're trying
to take a shower.
-Yeah, trying to shower.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.982
And nobody could have
come here with, like, a key...

04:09.984 --> 04:12.851
No, it's one of those
that you kind of...

04:12.853 --> 04:14.386
-[Adam] That you push?
-[Casey] Yeah.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.621
But we don't have a key to it,

04:15.623 --> 04:18.056
-to my knowledge.
-Oh, and this does not open.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.158
-This is a...
-Oh, this shuts automatically.

04:20.160 --> 04:20.826
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.327
[Adam whispers] Oh, wow!

04:23.964 --> 04:26.164
-[Amy] Let's check out
the men's dressing room.
-Sure.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.370
[Casey] This is
the King's room.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.704
[Adam] Well, what
happens in here?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.907
-We have the door
slamming behind you.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.110
-Or slamming in your face.
-[Amy] Mmm.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.047
[Casey] It always
feels heavy in here.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.916
Sometimes when we have
children in here playing,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.318
their behavior just...

04:46.754 --> 04:47.686
-is wrong.
-[Amy] Hmm.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.389
I mean, they get into
fights and they...

04:50.391 --> 04:52.291
It just seems like
it happens here.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.091
[Amy] Strange.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.027
Do you think
whatever's in here

04:55.029 --> 04:56.428
goes anywhere
else in the theater?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.196
I'm not sure.

04:58.999 --> 04:59.798
Okay.

04:59.866 --> 05:00.932
So, where to next?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.568
Okay, let's go to
the concession area.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.103
-Okay.
-[Casey] Sound good?

05:10.077 --> 05:14.980
This room,
coming from the balcony
entrance right there,

05:14.982 --> 05:18.083
there is a black shadow.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.385
And many of us have seen it.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.089
It just comes very quickly
around this way,

05:24.091 --> 05:25.657
and goes into the theater.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.758
[Amy] All right, okay.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.460
[Casey] It was just
a big, black shadow

05:28.462 --> 05:29.961
-came through.
-[Adam] That's weird.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.863
-And that's how you get to
the mezzanine, right?
-[Casey] Yes.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.465
-We get to go up there.
-Yeah.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.200
-We're gonna go up there.
-[Casey] Okay.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.938
-[Amy] You seem
a little hesitant.
-[Casey] Yes.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.506
[Casey] Absolutely. I-I...

05:41.508 --> 05:43.975
-I get the gooseys.
-[Amy] Okay.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.547
[Casey] So, up in this area,
there's a lot of heaviness.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.982
You just feel like something
is following you.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.285
Like something is right here
behind you just

05:53.287 --> 05:54.820
looking at you.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.723
Like, if you're down there,
do you ever see shadows
up here...

05:57.725 --> 05:59.925
-Yes. I've seen something...
-[Amy] ...or anything?

05:59.927 --> 06:00.892
...in the corner right here.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.060
Okay.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.328
-It looked feminine...
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.896
...but very bright.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.932
-[Adam] Wow.
-So it was just
as clear as day.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.801
-[Amy] Yeah.
-And I had never... I was just

06:09.803 --> 06:11.770
totally freaked out
at that point, I...

06:11.772 --> 06:12.738
wanted to leave.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.739
-Okay.
-[Amy] Yeah.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.073
[Amy] The ghosts
you're describing

06:15.075 --> 06:16.808
sound a little
more aggressive.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.609
Does that worry you at all?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.744
-Yes.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.079
-[Amy] It sounds
like you want answers.
-Mm-hmm.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.748
You wanna know who's here.
You wanna know why
they're here.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.416
Right.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.251
-[Amy] So you wanna
make sure it's...
-Everybody's safe.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.853
[Amy] Yeah, make sure
everybody's safe.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.888
Yeah, but nothing happened
during the time that we
were closed down.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.723
That they're still the same.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.558
-[Adam] Yeah, there's
a lot to go over.
-Okay.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.726
-A ton. Yeah.
-[Adam] We should set up.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.195
-We definitely should.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.564
<i> [Amy] The Rialto Theatre is</i>
<i>  a really cool historic place.</i>

06:39.566 --> 06:43.402
But the ghosts already
have me very confused.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.671
<i>  You have energy that is</i>
<i> slamming doors shut on people,</i>

06:46.673 --> 06:47.873
<i>  that is pushing people,</i>
<i>  you know,</i>

06:47.875 --> 06:49.908
<i>  shadow rushing</i>
<i>  through the place.</i>

06:49.910 --> 06:53.111
<i>  And that's just not</i>
<i>  typical theater activity.</i>

06:53.113 --> 06:55.714
I think Adam and I have
our work cut out for us.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.617
Um, but Casey is one
of the sweetest people

06:58.619 --> 07:02.220
and I know that he and I are
both very anxious to help her.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.062
<i> [Adam] Right now, Amy and I</i>
<i> are starting our investigation</i>

07:11.064 --> 07:13.432
<i>  in the main part</i>
<i>  of the theater.</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:15.801
<i>  There are claims of shadows,</i>

07:15.803 --> 07:17.402
<i>  footsteps above us,</i>

07:17.404 --> 07:19.871
<i>  something dark</i>
<i>  in the mezzanine.</i>

07:19.873 --> 07:22.073
<i>  So we decided to park it</i>
<i>  here on the stage.</i>

07:22.576 --> 07:23.742
<i>  And watch.</i>

07:23.744 --> 07:26.244
<i>  And see if anything</i>
<i>  shows up for us.</i>

07:27.514 --> 07:29.714
<i>  We got the laser grid set up,</i>

07:29.716 --> 07:33.018
<i>  just in case we see</i>
<i>  anything walk in front of it.</i>

07:33.587 --> 07:34.920
[Amy] I'm gonna set the...

07:34.922 --> 07:38.056
EMF trip wire up in that
little corner over there.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.624
This is the corner
of the theater

07:39.626 --> 07:41.860
where they see in here
a lot of activity.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.396
And so, I'm setting
up the EMF trip wire

07:44.565 --> 07:47.399
on this back set of chairs,

07:47.401 --> 07:51.069
and we're going to watch from
the stage and see if anything
manipulates them.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.285
My name is Adam
and this is Amy.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.090
[Amy] They're about to start
doing shows here again.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.393
It's been so quiet
for so long.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.998
Did you miss having
everyone here?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.902
[Adam] Does it look
like somebody's sitting

08:23.904 --> 08:25.370
in the top left there?

08:25.372 --> 08:27.038
-Up there on the left side?
-Yeah.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.445
If you... grab on to these
purple lights that you see,

08:34.748 --> 08:37.382
they'll change color and we'll
know that you're here.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.185
-[Adam exclaims]
-[Amy] Oh, wow!

08:40.187 --> 08:41.753
Oh, my God! That was a lot.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.122
-[Adam] If you're over--
-[Amy exclaims]

08:44.124 --> 08:46.024
[Adam] If you're over
there, can... Oh!

08:46.159 --> 08:47.225
Keep going.

08:47.928 --> 08:48.793
That's wild.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.262
[softly]
What are they doing?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.198
Can you make them
all go off at once?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.769
One, two, three, go!

08:57.771 --> 08:59.437
-Oh!
-Mm-mmm.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.943
[Amy] Did you figure out
how to make those work?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.145
We can talk to you
a bunch of different ways.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.915
We have this
little device here.

09:09.917 --> 09:14.052
It can record your voice even
if we're not hearing you.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.257
Did you work here
or do you work here?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.396
Were you part of
a performance here, ever?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.734
Do you know how
many of you are here?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.369
How many people
like you are here?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.808
[Adam] Were you sad when...

09:36.810 --> 09:40.712
the world kind of shut down
and all the shows
were cancelled

09:40.714 --> 09:42.147
for over a year?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.217
Do you know who Casey is?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.056
Can you tell us
what your name is?

09:54.061 --> 09:56.561
[Amy] Okay, now I see
something in that upper
left-hand side.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.196
[Adam] Yeah. It's weird.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.399
[Amy] It was a kind of
a light brownish color.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.402
If you're up in the balcony...

10:05.072 --> 10:07.305
we think we can
see you sometimes.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.742
[static disturbance]

10:10.744 --> 10:13.311
<i> [recorder playing] Did you</i>
<i> work here or do you work here?</i>

10:14.314 --> 10:17.015
<i>  Were you part of</i>
<i>  a performance here, ever?</i>

10:18.251 --> 10:19.951
-Did he say, "No"?
-"No."

10:19.953 --> 10:22.187
<i> [recorder playing] Were you</i>
<i>  part of a performance</i>
<i>  here, ever?</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:24.255
That was a no.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.697
<i> [recorder playing] Do you know</i>
<i>  how many of you are here?</i>

10:32.699 --> 10:34.633
<i>  How many people</i>
<i>  like you are here?</i>

10:34.635 --> 10:35.533
<i> [voice on recorder] No.</i>

10:36.403 --> 10:38.770
"No." It sounds like
the exact same word.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.805
[recorder playing]
<i>  ...shut down and all</i>
<i>  the shows were cancelled</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.440
<i>  for over a year?</i>

10:42.442 --> 10:44.409
<i> [Amy on recorder] Do you</i>
<i>  know who Casey is?</i>

10:45.612 --> 10:47.946
<i> [Adam on recorder] Can you</i>
<i>  tell us what your name is?</i>

10:48.915 --> 10:51.883
That's weird.
We got two quick "No's"...

10:51.885 --> 10:52.851
But they sounded the same.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.686
They sounded like
the exact same voice

10:54.688 --> 10:56.688
saying the exact
same thing twice.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.090
And that thing that was
sitting up there is gone.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.894
If you're listening to us,
you're watching us,

11:02.962 --> 11:04.095
right now,

11:04.164 --> 11:06.064
please know that we...

11:06.533 --> 11:09.367
We're gonna be
here for a few days.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.705
So each and every one of you
will have ample opportunity

11:13.707 --> 11:16.975
to speak to us
and get our attention.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.643
If there's something
you really want done,

11:18.645 --> 11:20.412
if you need an answer
to something,

11:20.414 --> 11:23.114
if you need us to pass
a message along,

11:23.116 --> 11:26.418
if you're in any sort
of distress or need help,

11:26.420 --> 11:28.920
we're here for that, too.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.890
But we just need to...
We can't walk out of
here without answers.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.925
So, please make sure you do...

11:33.993 --> 11:35.459
talk to us.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.031
-[Amy] All right,
let's go ahead and...
-[Adam] Yeah, we'll come back.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.468
<i> [Adam] Tonight was</i>
<i>  a very tough night.</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:46.037
But it's usually the way it is

11:46.039 --> 11:48.773
when you start investigating
a massive space like

11:48.775 --> 11:49.741
a theater.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.509
<i>  We did have things happen.</i>

11:51.511 --> 11:55.113
<i>  But it doesn't seem</i>
<i>  like we've encountered</i>
<i>  the entity responsible</i>

11:55.115 --> 11:58.183
<i>  for following and attacking</i>
<i>  a paranormal investigator</i>

11:58.185 --> 11:59.684
<i>  in her own home.</i>

11:59.686 --> 12:02.854
<i>  An attachment is</i>
<i>  so unusual and potentially</i>
<i>  very dangerous.</i>

12:02.856 --> 12:04.522
<i>  We need to bring that team in</i>

12:04.524 --> 12:07.058
<i>  and talk to them about</i>
<i>  their experiences here.</i>

12:14.334 --> 12:16.501
[Amy] So Allen and Janeen,
you are both investigators?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.403
Yes, ma'am.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.939
Okay, how many times did you
say you've investigated
the theater?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.708
-Uh, numerous times. I've lost
count to tell you the truth.
-[Janeen] Many.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.876
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-[Amy] Okay.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.112
And then what would
you say have been

12:27.114 --> 12:30.749
some of the more
compelling experiences

12:30.751 --> 12:32.050
that you've had here?

12:32.118 --> 12:34.419
We were sitting out here,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.721
and then all of a sudden,

12:36.723 --> 12:39.057
we heard this
really loud noise.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.927
When I looked up
back this way,

12:42.929 --> 12:47.098
I saw this tall...
black thing.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.968
Very fast and it went out
towards the concession.

12:49.970 --> 12:53.404
-That's so strange. Okay.
-[Janeen] It was super-fast.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.206
And other people
had seen it, too.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.808
The building was locked down.
Everybody was accounted for.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.409
Mm-hmm. Okay.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.981
Have you ever had any
experiences here where you

13:02.983 --> 13:04.983
felt unsafe?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.118
I took an attachment home.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.619
Tell me about that.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.822
[Janeen] Okay, the first
time we came here,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.524
something touched
my arm slightly.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.125
Like a feather.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.294
Maybe like... It felt like
something going up
and down on my arm.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.663
When we went back home,

13:18.665 --> 13:20.064
I was getting
ready to go to bed,

13:20.066 --> 13:21.833
and something
got on top of me.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.935
It was holding me down.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.905
I was literally frozen.
Could not move.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.707
And it felt like it was just
sucking the air out of
my lungs.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.976
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Janeen] I mean, I...

13:31.978 --> 13:34.913
could hear myself screaming,
but I was doing
everything I could

13:34.915 --> 13:37.615
to break loose,
and I was just, like, frozen.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.318
-Mm-hmm.
-And he heard me screaming,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.420
and when he... As soon
as the door opened,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.988
it, like, released me.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.991
And I was just gasping for air
when I come out of the bed.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.960
'Cause I couldn't...
I was just, like...

13:48.962 --> 13:51.162
suffocating, you know?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.631
And I didn't come back
here for two years.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.632
Mm-hmm.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.401
That's scary, though,
to think about

13:56.403 --> 13:59.137
coming in here and, like,
thinking that something

13:59.439 --> 14:01.639
could affect you like that.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.675
[Amy] Has your team dug
into the history here, at all?

14:03.677 --> 14:05.577
Beyond it being
a theater or...

14:05.579 --> 14:08.079
A little bit. We don't
know the full history of it.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.648
Uh, but we do know that back
in the day, back in the '30s

14:10.650 --> 14:11.883
and Prohibition time,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.918
that definitely
all around this area,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
that the mobsters
ruled the day.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.523
And from what I understand,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.992
this alley back here
was called "Death Alley."

14:20.994 --> 14:24.896
Because there were so many
murders committed back
in that area.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.731
I've never been able to find
any documentation on that

14:26.733 --> 14:28.800
or anything like that
but we've went ahead and...

14:28.802 --> 14:30.835
just incorporated
that in our investigation.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.404
-Okay.
-We're just,
I guess, stuck with...

14:34.608 --> 14:36.875
finding out whatever's here,

14:36.877 --> 14:38.776
could it potentially
get worse or...

14:38.778 --> 14:40.478
do they need something,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.847
and those two things are
the hardest things
to figure out.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.582
-Okay. Thank you so much.
-Yeah, thank you so much.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.718
-We appreciate your help.
-[Janeen] Thank you.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.486
<i> [Amy] Right now, we don't</i>
<i>  know if the aggressive spirit</i>

14:48.488 --> 14:49.954
<i>  is here all the time,</i>

14:49.956 --> 14:52.724
<i>  or maybe just hasn't</i>
<i>  shown itself to us yet.</i>

14:52.726 --> 14:54.692
<i>  So, we're gonna call Chip.</i>

14:54.694 --> 14:55.860
<i>  If there's something</i>
<i>  hiding from us,</i>

14:55.862 --> 14:58.096
<i>  maybe he will pick up on it.</i>

15:02.269 --> 15:03.935
[Amy on phone]
<i>  All right, so Chip, we are</i>

15:03.937 --> 15:06.371
<i>  calling you from</i>
<i>  a top-secret location.</i>

15:07.841 --> 15:11.509
Have you gotten any reads
on anything before

15:11.511 --> 15:12.610
we start?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.414
There's a combination of
things that are going on here.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.417
Feels like there's one
thing that's happening,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.319
<i>  and then there's another</i>
<i>  thing that's happening.</i>

15:22.722 --> 15:24.689
And I don't know if those
things really blend.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.424
Doesn't necessarily
feel like they do.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.660
It feels like they're like
two separate incidents.

15:28.662 --> 15:29.694
[Amy and Adam] Okay.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.996
And what's the deal
with outside

15:31.998 --> 15:34.065
on the grounds
of where you're at?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.100
[clicks tongue] I don't know.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.873
<i> [Chip] There's something</i>
<i>  not contained in the...</i>

15:41.875 --> 15:43.274
the space that you're in.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.045
It's exterior to that
space somehow.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.850
<i> [Amy] All right. Well,</i>
<i>  why don't we get started</i>
<i>  with what's inside.</i>

15:52.852 --> 15:54.052
-Okay.
<i>  -Yeah, yeah.</i>

15:56.022 --> 15:57.322
[Amy] Okay, here we go.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.224
Anything in this area?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.263
He comes into this space.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.166
-[Adam] "He"?
-He.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.234
Okay.

16:10.837 --> 16:11.436
<i>  Who's "he"?</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:13.237
He's not nice.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.345
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-Right.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.646
<i> [Chip] Well, I don't</i>
<i>  like him at all.</i>

16:21.648 --> 16:22.947
Okay.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.415
<i>  How does he, uh,</i>
<i>  present himself?</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:26.717
Dark.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.955
Okay. There is a shadow seen
here that rushes people a lot.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.858
<i> -[Chip] Yeah.</i>
<i> -Like, he'll just run at you.</i>

16:33.860 --> 16:36.294
-That's probably the man.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.798
<i> [Chip] So this is [bleep] up.</i>

16:40.800 --> 16:43.868
<i>  There's something that you're</i>
<i>  showing me on my screen</i>
<i>  right now</i>

16:43.870 --> 16:45.269
that's giving me the creeps.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.005
<i> [Adam and Amy] Okay.</i>

16:49.009 --> 16:51.676
<i> [Chip] All right, so,</i>
<i>  what's up at the top?</i>

16:51.678 --> 16:53.978
[Amy] That's the mezzanine,
the balcony.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.080
I don't like that area
for some reason.

16:56.783 --> 16:57.648
[Adam] Okay.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.549
Let's take him up there.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.084
[Amy] Yeah,
we'll take you up there.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.386
<i> [Adam] Chip, can we, uh,</i>
<i>  do an experiment with you?</i>

17:01.388 --> 17:03.855
Okay.

17:03.857 --> 17:07.725
<i> [Adam] Amy and I are going</i>
<i>  to attempt to investigate</i>
<i>  with Chip remotely,</i>

17:07.727 --> 17:09.627
<i>  in a way that we</i>
<i>  have not done before.</i>

17:09.629 --> 17:11.996
<i>  We sent him some</i>
<i>  virtual reality goggles</i>

17:11.998 --> 17:14.699
<i>  and basically, he will</i>
<i>  only be able to see</i>

17:14.701 --> 17:17.668
<i> what I show him on the screen.</i>

17:17.670 --> 17:20.838
<i>  So, it's as if he's fully</i>
<i> immersed in the space with us.</i>

17:20.840 --> 17:22.640
<i>  It's just that</i>
<i>  Chip will be, uh,</i>

17:22.642 --> 17:26.411
<i>  with us in a virtual</i>
<i>  reality sense.</i>

17:29.983 --> 17:33.084
Do you feel like you're here
at all or how does it seem?

17:33.086 --> 17:35.386
<i> [Chip] Interesting thing</i>
<i>  about it is I feel like</i>

17:35.388 --> 17:37.989
<i>  I'm right there with you.</i>

17:37.991 --> 17:40.324
[Adam] All right,
so we'll just investigate,
like, normal for a minute.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.394
Is there anybody
up here with us?

17:45.031 --> 17:47.131
<i> [Chip] You got some</i>
<i>  weird energy moving over near</i>

17:47.133 --> 17:48.633
a little walkway
near the exit sign.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.967
[Amy] Hmm.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.403
[Adam] It's interesting,
we actually thought we saw

17:52.405 --> 17:55.006
somebody sitting in the seats
over in that area last night.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.074
[Amy] Yeah.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.942
<i>  Why don't I over there?</i>

18:04.651 --> 18:05.783
Feels weird over here.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.818
[Adam] Yeah?
What's it feel like?

18:06.820 --> 18:07.852
I'm not gonna lie.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.353
You know that feeling
like something...

18:10.156 --> 18:11.889
is right behind you?

18:11.891 --> 18:12.990
Yeah.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.358
<i> [Amy] Ooh!</i>

18:15.028 --> 18:16.160
<i>  What was that?</i>

18:16.162 --> 18:19.697
Amy, you moved exactly
where I saw the shimmer

18:19.699 --> 18:21.833
<i>  of whatever it is.</i>

18:21.835 --> 18:24.035
Feels really weird right here,
I'll be honest.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.238
<i> -[Chip] Adam?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

18:27.740 --> 18:29.107
It's to Amy's right.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.142
<i> [Adam] He says to your right.</i>

18:34.080 --> 18:35.913
And it moved just...

18:35.915 --> 18:37.181
Go to the other side, Amy.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.517
<i> [Chip] Yes.</i>

18:41.287 --> 18:43.688
I felt like
I sat on it, like...

18:43.690 --> 18:44.989
Wow!

18:45.792 --> 18:49.660
Okay, so whoever you are,
I'm going to set this
near to you.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.030
<i>  Tell us what your name is</i>
<i>  as loud as you can.</i>

18:54.667 --> 18:57.268
I'm getting shivers all
up and down my spine, guys.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.972
<i> [Amy] Do you stay</i>
<i>  here all the time?</i>

19:01.774 --> 19:04.108
Do you know who Casey is?

19:06.779 --> 19:09.013
<i> [Amy] Who's the shadow that</i>
<i>  keeps running at people?</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:10.381
<i>  Who is this man?</i>

19:12.619 --> 19:14.252
What do you need from us?

19:16.456 --> 19:20.558
Okay, I'm gonna
turn this off
and we're gonna listen.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.427
<i> [recorder playing] Okay, so</i>
<i>  whoever you are, I'm going</i>
<i>  to set this near to you.</i>

19:23.429 --> 19:27.265
<i>  Can you tell us what your</i>
<i>  name is as loud as you can?</i>

19:28.768 --> 19:29.901
[static disturbance]

19:29.969 --> 19:31.669
-Did that say something?
-[Amy] Yeah,
it said something.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.405
<i>  I'm gonna bring this</i>
<i>  over to you</i>
<i>  so you can hear it.</i>

19:34.407 --> 19:36.941
<i> [recorder playing] Do you</i>
<i>  stay here all the time?</i>

19:36.943 --> 19:37.975
[static disturbance]

19:37.977 --> 19:40.411
Ooh, okay. Here we go.
We're getting answers now.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.913
Let's see.

19:41.981 --> 19:42.947
<i> [recorder playing] Do you</i>
<i>  stay here all the time?</i>

19:42.949 --> 19:44.148
[static disturbance]

19:44.150 --> 19:45.550
-No. Definitely no.
-[Adam] No.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.853
100% no.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.788
[recorder playing]
<i>  Who's the shadow that</i>
<i>  keeps running at people?</i>

19:50.790 --> 19:53.024
<i>  Who is this man?</i>

19:53.026 --> 19:56.093
<i>  We can help you if you just</i>
<i>  tell us what you need.</i>

19:57.363 --> 19:59.230
Okay, I'm gonna
turn this off.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.865
-We got that--
-[Amy] The clear "No."

20:00.867 --> 20:02.099
"No."

20:03.836 --> 20:06.003
At this point,
we've gotten very little

20:06.005 --> 20:07.705
identifiable evidence.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.373
So, we need to
dig a bit deeper.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.743
-Yes.
-We're gonna sign off and

20:12.745 --> 20:14.979
-keep pushing forward here.
<i> -[Chip] All right.</i>

20:16.549 --> 20:18.349
That was [bleep] bizarre.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.892
<i> [Adam] There's something in</i>
<i>  this space with us right now,</i>

20:27.894 --> 20:30.194
<i>  and it's trying</i>
<i>  to answer questions.</i>

20:30.196 --> 20:31.762
<i>  It seems to be having</i>
<i>  a difficult time</i>

20:31.764 --> 20:33.297
<i>  so we're breaking</i>
<i>  out the Frank's Box.</i>

20:34.100 --> 20:35.633
<i>  It's the original spirit box</i>

20:35.635 --> 20:38.269
<i>  and used radio waves</i>
<i>  to enhance the spirit's</i>
<i>  ability to communicate.</i>

20:45.011 --> 20:47.278
I'll tell you when
I'm good here.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.218
I'm good, Adam.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.054
[Adam] Okay.
Amy, can you hear me?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.589
Okay, no, she can't hear me.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.892
My name is Adam
and that's Amy.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.795
She's listening to something
that can hear you.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.064
Can you talk to her
and answer questions

21:07.066 --> 21:08.232
that I'm asking, please?

21:10.870 --> 21:12.970
You can start the conversation
if you want.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.172
"This moment...

21:16.309 --> 21:17.308
is dead."

21:19.178 --> 21:20.177
Why?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.281
"Get out of here."

21:24.751 --> 21:26.017
Do you not wanna talk to me?

21:26.019 --> 21:29.053
-"Adam"...
-That is my name.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.389
I don't mean you any harm.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.058
-I wanna help you.
-"Give us a..."

21:36.729 --> 21:37.395
[Adam] Give us a what?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.133
"Guys, cut it out."

21:43.102 --> 21:44.235
What?

21:45.204 --> 21:46.237
"You shouldn't...

21:48.007 --> 21:49.073
be..."

21:49.709 --> 21:51.342
Uh-huh. Keep talking.

21:52.245 --> 21:54.145
"You shouldn't be out back."

22:00.853 --> 22:02.018
Okay.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.888
Now we're getting somewhere.
What happened out back?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.790
What happened outside?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.325
-"Could you..."
-[Adam] What?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.226
-"take..."
-Uh-huh.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.264
-"His..."
-Who?

22:14.067 --> 22:15.266
"Take him..."

22:16.736 --> 22:18.836
You have to be more clear.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.072
What's wrong with outside?
What's wrong with out back?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.040
"Turning..."

22:23.042 --> 22:25.042
[Adam] Please
tell me something.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.379
Adam, it's Amy.
Don't give up on this session.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.047
There's like...

22:30.049 --> 22:32.216
I feel like something's
really trying to get through.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.422
[Adam] Are you the one
we were talking to earlier?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.224
"No."

22:41.661 --> 22:42.993
Okay, then who are you?

22:43.396 --> 22:45.096
"They're talking about you."

22:48.000 --> 22:49.333
-Who is--
-"Big, bad...

22:50.036 --> 22:51.235
people."

22:54.974 --> 22:56.073
Something happened to you?

22:56.576 --> 22:57.475
-And that--
-"Secret."

22:58.411 --> 23:00.311
It was kept a secret
in the alley?

23:00.913 --> 23:02.046
"Elmer."

23:03.149 --> 23:04.148
Is that your name?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.217
-Elmer?
-[Amy] "He...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.987
did... it."

23:10.823 --> 23:14.325
Someone named Elmer
hurt you.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.395
And you died, right?

23:18.865 --> 23:21.966
-"Leave."
-No, we're not leaving.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.135
Who's in the alley?

23:26.038 --> 23:27.304
Is Elmer out there?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.307
"Pretty much."

23:32.044 --> 23:34.378
Do you hide here,
away from Elmer?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.214
"Of course."

23:38.117 --> 23:39.150
Okay.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.153
[bleep]

23:44.123 --> 23:46.157
Elmer's not in here, right?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.093
"What is she doing?"

23:50.930 --> 23:52.163
"Trading."

23:53.866 --> 23:54.932
-[Adam] Elmer?
-"Thieves."

23:56.102 --> 23:57.134
"Careful."

23:58.104 --> 23:59.403
Should I be afraid of him?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.106
"What's happening?"

24:02.108 --> 24:05.109
Can... Does he come in here?
Into this theater?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.112
Where is Elmer now?

24:09.182 --> 24:11.048
-I need to take
this thing off.
-[Adam] Yeah.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.116
-Okay.
-Sorry.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.351
[sighs]

24:15.021 --> 24:16.120
[bleep]

24:16.889 --> 24:18.421
It's a lot.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.225
That was heavy. Adam,
I don't know what the [bleep]
it was saying but...

24:23.629 --> 24:24.862
Ooh-ey.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.531
[Adam] I mean...
It's weird because

24:27.533 --> 24:29.667
When you said
"Don't hold out,"

24:29.669 --> 24:31.469
like when you were, like,
"Hold on and think
there's something kind..."

24:31.471 --> 24:33.270
I mean, I felt the same thing.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.939
Yeah, I just felt like
somebody was really
trying to talk.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.975
I do feel like I'm gonna
throw up a little bit.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.813
Um, but I got the sense
this is where they

24:42.849 --> 24:44.048
like to be?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.650
Because they're
hiding from Elmer.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.918
Yeah, who
the [bleep] is Elmer?

24:47.920 --> 24:51.722
Elmer is the person that
did whatever he did

24:51.724 --> 24:54.124
to these people,
or this person.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.027
They hide from him here.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.865
And whatever
happened in the alley,

25:00.867 --> 25:02.967
I'm not supposed
to go out there.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.302
That's so weird.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.240
I also asked if Elmer
was in the alley.

25:09.242 --> 25:11.575
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-And, and... I think
you said, "Of course."

25:11.644 --> 25:13.077
Weird.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.614
I haven't, like, felt sick
from one of those
in a really long time.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.916
I just don't feel good.
I felt, I felt weird.

25:18.918 --> 25:19.783
-It's like...
-I wonder if you're...

25:19.785 --> 25:22.052
you're picking up on

25:22.054 --> 25:25.756
the same energy of the people
you're talking to?

25:25.758 --> 25:29.159
I think so. I felt gross.
I didn't like it.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.263
I debated pulling the plug
quite a few times.

25:32.265 --> 25:33.898
There's something
weird, like,

25:33.900 --> 25:36.901
the difference between
the Frank's Box and, like,
the spirit box...

25:36.903 --> 25:38.302
The Frank's Box, like,

25:38.804 --> 25:40.271
sentences come out slowly.

25:40.273 --> 25:43.741
-It's like, it spits out
a word at a time.
-Mm-hmm.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.977
You know, spirit box
is like snippets
and the occasional sentence.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.879
And you just really,
like, have to...

25:48.881 --> 25:50.080
There's just
something about...
I don't know.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.049
I definitely felt emotion.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.219
I felt, I felt scared.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.088
And I felt, like, panicky.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.157
-Yeah.
-And I felt kind of like...

26:00.760 --> 26:01.725
desperate.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.595
-Yeah.
-Like I felt
just like desperation.

26:04.597 --> 26:07.731
Whatever happened to
the person or the

26:07.733 --> 26:09.633
people that
we were talking to,

26:09.635 --> 26:10.935
they're still dealing with it.

26:10.937 --> 26:14.038
Like, they're hiding
from whoever it is,

26:15.007 --> 26:17.074
-still in this space.
-Mm-hmm.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.976
[clicks tongue] Yeah. Okay.

26:22.615 --> 26:25.816
<i> [Amy] We just finished up</i>
<i>  a Frank's Box session</i>
<i>  up on the</i>

26:25.818 --> 26:30.554
<i>  balcony and it was a really</i>
<i>  strange experience for me.</i>

26:30.556 --> 26:32.389
<i>  Felt like something was</i>
<i>  really trying to get through.</i>

26:32.391 --> 26:33.691
<i>  Felt very desperate,</i>
<i>  it was weird.</i>

26:33.693 --> 26:36.126
<i>  I felt like I was feeling it.</i>

26:36.128 --> 26:37.995
Like, I felt sick after
and so...

26:37.997 --> 26:40.230
Anyways, right now I'm gonna

26:40.232 --> 26:42.499
dig and see...
The name "Elmer" came up.

26:42.501 --> 26:45.035
So I'm gonna just look and see
if there was anyone
named Elmer

26:45.037 --> 26:48.539
in Morrilton, who did anything
of any consequence.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.307
So, we'll see what happens.

26:58.551 --> 26:59.983
<i> [Adam] This is</i>
<i>  definitely a small town,</i>

27:00.720 --> 27:02.820
<i>  because word got out about</i>
<i>  our investigation</i>
<i>  at the theater.</i>

27:02.822 --> 27:04.922
<i>  An employee from</i>
<i>  a nearby store</i>

27:04.924 --> 27:06.657
<i>  whose shop also</i>
<i>  abuts Death Alley,</i>

27:06.659 --> 27:08.058
<i>  reached out to us.</i>

27:08.060 --> 27:11.328
<i>  Supposedly, he has evidence</i>
<i>  of something shocking.</i>

27:12.999 --> 27:14.131
[Adam] Jackson, hi.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.599
-[Jackson] Hello,
how are y'all?
-[Amy] Hey, Jackson.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.401
[Adam] So you have a video
you wanna show us, right?

27:17.403 --> 27:20.371
I do have a video.
This was back in 2013.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.143
<i> [Amy] That's...</i>

27:26.145 --> 27:27.878
That is forceful, though.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.313
<i>  That's wild.</i>

27:32.885 --> 27:35.386
[Amy] It looks like
almost like it explodes.

27:35.388 --> 27:36.754
Like it falls apart in midair.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.890
[Jackson] Yeah, like it just
explodes in the air, yeah.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.626
So, we were just sitting here
and no one was in here

27:42.628 --> 27:44.862
and we heard
a very loud crash.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.965
So just for the heck of it,
I re-round the camera.

27:47.967 --> 27:48.766
-[Amy] Yeah.
-And that's what I saw.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.867
[Adam] That's explosion.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.404
We've had a lot
of strange things go on.

27:53.406 --> 27:56.140
I don't even know how
that happens. That's crazy.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.775
If you can think of anybody
else that we can talk to about

27:57.777 --> 27:59.943
experiences here,
just let us know.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.879
-[Amy] Yeah.
-And if you think
of anything, let us know.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.048
-[Amy] All right,
thank you so much.
-[Adam] Thank you. Thank you.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.215
That's crazy.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.352
<i> [Amy] We don't know</i>
<i>  what this means, exactly.</i>

28:08.354 --> 28:10.554
<i> But this case just got bigger.</i>

28:10.556 --> 28:13.390
<i>  Something seems to be</i>
<i>  affecting more than</i>
<i>  just the theater.</i>

28:13.392 --> 28:15.259
<i>  There's got to</i>
<i>  be a connection.</i>

28:19.765 --> 28:20.798
<i>  So, the more that</i>
<i>  I'm doing research,</i>

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
<i>  the less I'm finding.</i>

28:22.802 --> 28:26.003
But I was thinking, since
we've already encountered

28:26.005 --> 28:29.339
one person who
has activity in their,

28:30.009 --> 28:33.010
um, shop in this same row,

28:33.012 --> 28:34.411
what if it's not
just the theater?

28:34.413 --> 28:37.114
What if it's this whole block?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.916
There's something
not contained in the...

28:38.918 --> 28:41.719
the space
that you're in. It's...

28:41.721 --> 28:44.154
it's exterior to that
space somehow.

28:44.890 --> 28:45.989
The reality is, is that

28:45.991 --> 28:49.393
<i>  this whole block is like one</i>
<i>  set of buildings.</i>

28:49.395 --> 28:51.428
There's no documented
deaths in this theater.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.397
There's a lot of rumored
deaths in the alley.

28:53.399 --> 28:57.668
And back in the '30s,
they called that alley
"Death Alley."

28:57.670 --> 28:58.736
[Adam] Hmm.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.871
And there was rumored to be

29:00.873 --> 29:02.806
some murders that happened.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.508
-Wow! That's interesting.
-Okay.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.776
You know what, though?

29:05.778 --> 29:06.877
That could also explain
why there's activity

29:06.879 --> 29:08.746
in some of the other
stores in here.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.614
<i> [Adam] The idea</i>
<i>  would be connecting</i>

29:10.616 --> 29:12.750
<i>  whatever's in the alley</i>
<i>  to the space inside.</i>

29:12.752 --> 29:14.685
Like, is there a correlation?
Is there a connection?

29:14.687 --> 29:16.587
I think there is
because we've gotten

29:16.589 --> 29:20.791
twice now information
saying that,

29:20.793 --> 29:22.893
you know, whether they
don't stay here or, like,

29:22.895 --> 29:24.795
when we did the Frank's Box,
it was like,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.897
"The alley.
Be careful in the alley."

29:26.899 --> 29:28.665
I'm just wondering if
we're gonna meet someone

29:28.667 --> 29:29.767
different in the alley.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.468
If we're gonna
meet the more...

29:31.470 --> 29:33.470
Like, Elmer. Whoever Elmer is.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.973
I think, look, during
that Frank's Box session,

29:35.975 --> 29:39.343
they said whoever this person
is that caused this harm,

29:39.745 --> 29:40.844
hangs out there.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.846
So, I think you go outside,

29:42.848 --> 29:43.847
you listen to the spirit box.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.116
I will be inside.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.186
I'm probably gonna stick
to, like, this back area

29:49.188 --> 29:50.888
and see what you say.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.189
-Yeah.
-Okay.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.390
All right, let's do it.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.029
Adam and I wanted to think
outside the box tonight,

29:59.031 --> 30:00.731
um, as far as how we
were investigating.

30:00.733 --> 30:01.799
<i>  You know that the alley</i>
<i>  kept coming up,</i>

30:01.801 --> 30:03.133
<i>  outside kept coming up,</i>

30:03.135 --> 30:04.902
<i>  talking about someone</i>
<i>  being wronged.</i>

30:04.904 --> 30:07.771
So of course we had to move
our investigation to
that space.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.673
<i>  Adam and I split up.</i>

30:09.675 --> 30:11.508
<i>  Adam went outside</i>
<i>  with the spirit box.</i>

30:11.510 --> 30:13.944
I'm gonna be listening to him

30:13.946 --> 30:15.913
through headphones, and I'm
gonna be asking questions

30:15.915 --> 30:17.414
<i>  via the walkie.</i>

30:25.090 --> 30:27.090
If there's anybody out here,
you can talk to me

30:27.092 --> 30:28.392
through this device.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.968
<i> [Amy] Who is Elmer?</i>

30:38.804 --> 30:40.070
"I've passed."

30:40.973 --> 30:42.272
[Amy] How did you pass?

30:44.076 --> 30:45.175
"I'm fine with it."

30:47.413 --> 30:49.379
Who is in the alley with you?

30:50.916 --> 30:52.282
[Adam] "Big deal."

30:54.053 --> 30:55.219
<i> [Amy] You're a big deal?</i>

30:56.355 --> 30:57.955
"In public."

30:58.891 --> 31:01.558
Well, I haven't heard of you.
Can you tell me what
your name is?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.261
Just so I could know
what a big deal you are.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.432
If you wanna be
a really big deal,

31:08.434 --> 31:10.434
you should touch my friend
Adam out there.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.004
[exclaims in fear]

31:14.006 --> 31:16.139
Something just touched
my elbow.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.947
Do you ever come
inside this theater?

31:23.949 --> 31:28.051
-Or do you stay out there?
-"They burned me."

31:28.053 --> 31:30.821
<i> [Adam] That was</i>
<i>  a weird [bleep] voice.</i>

31:30.823 --> 31:32.089
<i>  I'm sorry.</i>

31:32.825 --> 31:33.957
It was like a...

31:34.025 --> 31:36.793
[in gravelly voice] They...
they... they burned me.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.062
Or something
like [bleep] weird.

31:39.965 --> 31:40.831
Well, guess what?

31:41.267 --> 31:42.599
I would love to be
able to tell people

31:42.601 --> 31:43.633
<i>  what happened to you.</i>

31:43.702 --> 31:45.402
<i>  So, can you tell me</i>
<i>  what your name is?</i>

31:51.010 --> 31:53.377
It's so weird, Amy,
I'm just... [clears throat].

31:54.079 --> 31:55.979
I just feel really...

31:56.448 --> 31:57.948
unsafe?

32:03.589 --> 32:05.989
<i> [Amy] My friend doesn't</i>
<i>  feel safe out there.</i>

32:05.991 --> 32:08.125
Are you trying to make
him feel that way?

32:10.029 --> 32:11.061
[Adam] "Overjoyed."

32:11.931 --> 32:14.197
You like when people
don't feel safe?

32:16.969 --> 32:19.102
<i>  Is it safe here,</i>
<i>  in the theater?</i>

32:20.072 --> 32:21.238
"Yes."

32:22.875 --> 32:24.975
Is it safe in the alley?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.945
"Who's on me?"

32:28.080 --> 32:28.912
<i>  "On to me."</i>

32:28.981 --> 32:30.247
[Amy] Hmm.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.750
I'm on to you.
I'm in the theater.

32:33.752 --> 32:36.386
My friend's out there
but I'm inside here
talking to you.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.924
"Gotta get up."

32:40.926 --> 32:42.993
Do you need help?
Do you need me to help you up?

32:43.829 --> 32:44.995
"I wouldn't."

32:45.631 --> 32:47.397
Should I stay in here

32:47.399 --> 32:49.333
or do you need me to come
out there and help you?

32:49.768 --> 32:50.968
"Don't."

32:51.804 --> 32:53.103
Don't come out there, huh?

32:53.973 --> 32:55.072
"Mayday!"

32:57.810 --> 32:58.408
<i>  "Tomorrow."</i>

32:59.745 --> 33:01.044
"Our brother."

33:02.414 --> 33:04.414
Do you wanna tell me any name?

33:04.416 --> 33:07.017
So I can find out what
happened to you, sir.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.054
[sputters]

33:11.690 --> 33:13.657
There's some...
There's like lots
of little things happening.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.359
I can't make it out.
Like, I'm...

33:21.100 --> 33:23.834
Uh, you guys can go ahead
and tap out Adam.

33:23.836 --> 33:24.434
Whoever's out there.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.737
[Adam shrieks]

33:26.739 --> 33:27.971
Oh, my God!

33:28.474 --> 33:29.806
I just kept feeling...

33:29.808 --> 33:33.043
I was... I've never felt
more unsafe doing that.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.611
I don't know.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.113
More than any spirit box,

33:36.115 --> 33:38.115
I have no idea
what just happened.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.349
[exhales]

33:48.093 --> 33:50.394
So that was actually,
like, really similar

33:50.396 --> 33:54.865
to my spirit box session.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.134
Sounds like something
definitely went on
in that alley.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.703
First it sounded like you
were someone who enjoyed

33:59.705 --> 34:02.739
pain and suffering.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.876
And right off the bat,
I go, "Who is Elmer?"

34:05.878 --> 34:08.111
And you say, "I have passed."

34:09.081 --> 34:10.414
And I said,
"How did you pass?"

34:10.416 --> 34:11.381
[knocking]

34:13.786 --> 34:15.652
Who's knocking?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.120
-What was that?
-[Adam] Where's Andy?

34:18.924 --> 34:20.190
Well, it's right
back there, right?

34:21.060 --> 34:22.159
It's not Bri?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.794
[Adam] No, Bri
is sitting over there.

34:23.796 --> 34:25.195
What the [bleep]?

34:26.131 --> 34:27.431
[Adam] It was like
knocking this way.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.900
[Amy] Yeah, in this...

34:29.902 --> 34:32.235
Sorry. I mean, we've been here
for days and
we haven't heard that.

34:33.305 --> 34:33.937
[knock]

34:33.939 --> 34:35.004
You heard that right, Andy?

34:35.006 --> 34:36.973
[Andy] Yeah, it was like...
It was like metal.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.875
[Adam softly]
Go down that way...

34:38.877 --> 34:40.043
[Amy] Is it outside?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.111
[Adam whispers] Here.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.180
Shh.

34:43.715 --> 34:44.814
[metallic knocking]

34:44.983 --> 34:47.084
-[Amy] What the [bleep]?
-[Adam] What the [bleep]?

34:52.424 --> 34:53.356
[Amy] Is someone outside?

34:54.126 --> 34:55.225
Be careful.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.928
[thuds]

34:57.930 --> 35:00.964
[Amy] I'm nervous about
that sound outside.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.066
Didn't it sound like

35:03.068 --> 35:04.134
someone was
knocking on the door?

35:04.136 --> 35:05.435
[Adam] It sounded
like something...

35:05.704 --> 35:07.904
[metal clinking]

35:07.906 --> 35:11.074
-[Amy] That was weird.
-[Adam] What jiggled
this? Let's see.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.343
[metal clinking]

35:13.779 --> 35:15.178
That's what it sounded like.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.114
[Amy] It sounded like
someone's on the ladder.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.116
Hello?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.920
Is someone up there?

35:23.922 --> 35:25.789
The ladder. Should I climb up
the ladder and look?

35:25.791 --> 35:26.823
[Amy] No!

35:26.825 --> 35:28.792
That ladder's not safe. No.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.560
[Adam] My heart is pounding.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.897
[Amy] I thought it was
an actual live person.

35:33.899 --> 35:37.000
I thought we were
being, like, broken into.

35:44.877 --> 35:46.643
Let me tell you the rest.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.946
[Adam] Yeah, please,
because that was weird.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.048
[Amy] Okay, so I'm like,
"Who's in the alley with you?"

35:52.050 --> 35:53.350
And you said, "Big deal."

35:54.653 --> 35:56.419
Then I said,
"You're a big deal?"

35:56.421 --> 35:58.855
-And you said,
"In public, yes."
-[chuckles] Okay.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.858
And I said, "If you want
to be a really big deal,
touch Adam."

36:01.860 --> 36:04.161
And then you said, "Something
just touched my elbow."

36:04.163 --> 36:06.563
-Yeah, right here.
-After I told it to touch you.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.964
That's [bleep].

36:08.800 --> 36:10.667
And I said, "Do you ever
come inside this theater

36:10.669 --> 36:11.601
or do you stay out there?"

36:11.603 --> 36:13.737
And you said,
"They burned me."

36:13.739 --> 36:15.739
And you said that
was a really weird voice.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.507
-It was so [bleep]
weird, like--
-Yeah.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.910
And this is when you're like,
"I feel bad."

36:19.912 --> 36:22.112
I felt really unsafe and it
wasn't the fact that I was

36:22.114 --> 36:23.413
sitting in the middle
of an alley.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.615
It felt not safe.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.950
[Amy] And I said,
"My friend doesn't feel safe.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.286
Are you trying to make
him feel that way?"

36:29.288 --> 36:31.888
And it said,
"Who's on me?" Or "On to me?"

36:31.890 --> 36:33.757
-Like, you started
saying that.
-Mm-hmm.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.358
And I said, "I'm on to you."

36:35.360 --> 36:36.960
And you said, "Gotta get up."

36:36.962 --> 36:39.963
And I'm like, "You need help?"
And you're like, "I wouldn't."

36:41.967 --> 36:43.767
I mean, what I got
from it, doing it,

36:43.769 --> 36:46.203
I felt really unsafe, A,

36:46.205 --> 36:49.773
that voice threw me,
and then getting touched
threw me.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.408
It was so weird.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.877
Well, someone got burned.
Like, it's clear.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.746
Right, and something climbed
up the ladder onto the roof.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.782
That was really, really weird.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.917
If that alley, and the
activity, and that space

37:00.919 --> 37:03.186
-is fueling activity...
-Mm-hmm.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.388
...whether in this building
or on this block,

37:06.158 --> 37:07.123
it's apparent.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.260
Like it's...
We've seen similar activity

37:10.262 --> 37:12.829
at the antique store
as in here.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.098
I mean,
I think we have answers.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.800
We don't know who.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.635
-But we know why.
-Yeah.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.804
I think we have
a lot to tell Casey.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.772
I'm totally
weirded out by this,

37:22.774 --> 37:24.874
the ladder situation,
I mean...

37:24.876 --> 37:27.210
[Adam] Never
experienced that before.

37:28.013 --> 37:30.747
I feel like this building
is just this, like,

37:30.749 --> 37:34.818
this perfect storm of energy.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.922
<i>  This theater has just</i>
<i>  multiple moments in time</i>

37:38.924 --> 37:40.257
<i>  that just keep</i>
<i>  replaying, you know?</i>

37:40.259 --> 37:42.392
<i>  There is no one spirit here.</i>

37:42.394 --> 37:46.196
There is just constant energy
going in and out of
this space.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.337
-[Amy] Welcome back.
-[Adam] Yeah, how are
you feeling?

37:54.873 --> 37:55.839
Little nervous.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.408
I mean, it's...
It's a part of my life

37:58.410 --> 38:00.410
being here, I'd like to
know what's going on.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.412
Okay, so first,

38:02.414 --> 38:05.015
we just wanted to kind of get
to the bottom of the history
of the theater.

38:05.017 --> 38:08.318
Because this whole
entire city block

38:08.320 --> 38:10.520
has been so many
different things.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.723
We also wanted to figure out
why the building could
be haunted.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.626
And there really wasn't
any evidence of any deaths

38:16.628 --> 38:18.094
that we could find.

38:18.096 --> 38:21.765
This area back here
that you call "Death Alley,"

38:21.767 --> 38:23.967
we couldn't find anything

38:23.969 --> 38:28.071
concrete on that existing,
but we do think

38:28.073 --> 38:30.840
there were obviously things
going on back there.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.043
We wanted to make
sure that we tackled

38:33.045 --> 38:34.477
what you're most
nervous about.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.413
Your friend, Janeen,

38:36.415 --> 38:38.848
she thought she had
an attachment that came
from here.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.418
She had one thing happen
after she left here.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.287
And what she described
was sleep paralysis.

38:44.289 --> 38:47.390
I suffer from sleep paralysis
and sleep hallucinations.

38:47.392 --> 38:50.694
And what you just described
is textbook sleep paralysis.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.730
So, I totally understand why
she would be afraid of it.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.964
I...
It's the most terrifying...

38:54.966 --> 38:57.834
It's much more frightening
than actual ghosts.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.836
And so I can see
why that affected her.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.604
But other people coming here,

39:01.606 --> 39:03.807
they don't have to worry
about that happening.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.842
You're not gonna get
an attachment coming to
the theater.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.676
Okay, that's great to know.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.045
We did go up
into the mezzanine.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.647
When we were up there,
there were a couple things

39:10.649 --> 39:11.781
that happened that
were very unique.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.883
First day, we were here
looking up there

39:13.885 --> 39:15.752
and we saw what appeared
to be somebody

39:15.754 --> 39:18.922
sort of sitting
in the mezzanine,

39:18.924 --> 39:21.524
something like a shadow figure
up on the top left part.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.892
And I...

39:22.894 --> 39:23.893
We were both like,
"That's weird.
I don't know..."

39:23.895 --> 39:25.261
And it went away.

39:25.263 --> 39:26.463
And it would come back
and it went away.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.897
We were like,
"That's strange."

39:27.899 --> 39:29.899
-We did get something
interesting on the DBR...
-Right.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.568
...that was in that area.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.937
Our camera picked
this up last night.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.840
<i> [Adam] So it sort of manifests</i>
<i>  and then it comes forward.</i>

39:36.842 --> 39:38.575
<i> -[Casey] Oh, wow!</i>
<i> -[Amy] There it is.</i>

39:38.577 --> 39:39.676
<i> -[Casey] Yeah.</i>
<i>  -[Amy] Okay.</i>

39:39.678 --> 39:42.712
[Adam] We were asking
questions about, like,

39:42.714 --> 39:44.681
you know, trying to figure
out who they were

39:44.683 --> 39:47.016
and why they were there,
and we got the sense
that this was

39:47.018 --> 39:49.386
somebody who
wasn't here all the time,

39:49.388 --> 39:51.721
that was
terrified of the alley,

39:51.723 --> 39:54.090
told me I had to
be careful of the alley.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.658
[Amy] So we put
Adam in the alley,

39:55.660 --> 39:56.426
all by himself.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.162
It was the only time I felt...

39:59.531 --> 40:01.297
weirdly unsafe.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.968
And just the energy itself
was really uncomfortable.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.003
Oh, my goodness!

40:07.005 --> 40:08.838
I mean, that's powerful,
whatever that is.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.006
[Amy] But...

40:10.008 --> 40:11.741
I said, "I'm inside
here in the theater.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.143
My friend is outside.

40:13.145 --> 40:14.878
Is it safe here
in the theater?"

40:14.946 --> 40:15.845
"Yes."

40:16.948 --> 40:19.949
And so, it's one
of those things that,

40:20.419 --> 40:22.752
if you're living in it
in the day-to-day,

40:22.754 --> 40:24.788
if you're working in it,
it's fine.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.757
Especially in the theater,
because the theater is
such a positive space.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.959
You do so much
in here that's positive.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.562
Whoever is watching
over this building,

40:32.564 --> 40:34.397
just needs to be
mindful that, like,

40:34.399 --> 40:36.833
you do have something
here that could escalate.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.669
And so, the alley itself,

40:39.671 --> 40:41.004
I don't know what
went on back there.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.773
We cannot find the history.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.909
But it wasn't nice,
it wasn't great,

40:45.911 --> 40:47.877
whatever it is.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.079
You know, you do have
to be careful with it.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.750
It matches, I mean...

40:53.752 --> 40:56.953
I understand what y'all
are saying about the alley

40:56.955 --> 40:59.622
and the history of Morrilton.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.791
Now that explains
a lot on that.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.929
Should we have people in
who want to do...

41:05.931 --> 41:09.432
paranormal investigations
or should we not?

41:09.868 --> 41:11.901
I think you

41:11.903 --> 41:13.670
can have people
in to investigate

41:13.672 --> 41:16.005
as long as you give
them very strict guidelines

41:16.007 --> 41:18.007
as far as what they can
and cannot do.

41:18.009 --> 41:20.577
You know, let them
know that they cannot

41:20.579 --> 41:22.245
bring up negative things.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.415
I would not let
them in the alley.

41:25.417 --> 41:28.318
'Cause you don't want
something out there
coming in here.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.053
And that they have
to come in strong.

41:30.055 --> 41:33.356
Like, because the second
you come into this situation
like this weak,

41:33.358 --> 41:36.092
spirits manifest
based on that.

41:36.094 --> 41:39.062
And so, it's just, as long as
you have people you trust,

41:39.064 --> 41:39.929
you should be fine.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.196
Okay.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.732
<i> [Adam] I feel really great</i>
<i>  about leaving here because</i>

41:42.734 --> 41:45.635
theater is a place for
community and for people

41:45.637 --> 41:48.771
and, um, this space
is warm and inviting

41:48.773 --> 41:51.741
<i>  and that's the way it's gonna</i>
<i>  be for another hundred years.</i>

41:51.743 --> 41:53.776
<i>  It's great that they're gonna</i>
<i> get back to doing productions.</i>

41:53.778 --> 41:55.812
They're gonna be safe.

41:55.814 --> 42:00.950
And, um, I feel positive
about leaving this space
in their hands.

42:02.254 --> 42:04.120
