WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:02.392
Previously on SEAL Team...
Several members of

00:02.430 --> 00:06.298
the Naw SEAL team have been
killed in Afghanistan.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.364
Go, go, go!

00:07.400 --> 00:09.209
SONNY:
So, you're telling me

00:09.240 --> 00:10.502
that all six guys are dead.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.564
Survivors?

00:11.610 --> 00:12.634
MANDY:
None that we know of.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.704
This is the poppy field

00:13.740 --> 00:15.537
that Echo Team burned.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.571
The truck directly ties
the bomb maker

00:17.610 --> 00:19.441
to the farm and Echo Team.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.414
We're gonna find the guy
behind it, and then we're gonna

00:21.450 --> 00:23.486
find the guy behind him
and the guy behind him,

00:23.520 --> 00:24.714
because that's what we do.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.116
I know other men.
I'll give them all to you.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.149
MANDY:
She could live on the base.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.122
Live as a girl,

00:29.160 --> 00:30.559
work as a boy.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.148
I'm the love of your life,

00:32.200 --> 00:35.124
but I don't think
I should be your wife anymore.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.094
Jason Hayes. I'm Amy.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.439
Nice to meet you, Amy.
So what do you do around here?

00:39.470 --> 00:42.337
I save the world from bad guys.
I have a good time doing it.

00:42.370 --> 00:43.735
SONNY:
Ooh, look at that right there.

00:43.770 --> 00:46.102
She just gave you
the steel eye.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.671
(helicopter blades whirring,
indistinct chatter)

00:49.710 --> 00:51.701
Careful. Right here.

01:07.460 --> 01:10.293
Hey. Bus just pulled
up from the airfield.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.490
Guys are
getting de-jocked.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.191
How about their prisoner?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.559
They handed him over.
He's getting processed.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.306
Sounds like it's gonna
be about another hour

01:16.340 --> 01:18.308
before he's ready
for interrogation.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.729
Great. So we got the guy
who made the heroin.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.271
God, you wouldn't think
it'd be so hard to figure out

01:23.310 --> 01:25.574
who owns a stupid poppy field.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.511
Cash we found in that tunnel
bankrolled a hit

01:28.550 --> 01:29.744
on an American
specnal ops team.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.644
Makes sense
they'd want to stay hidden.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.419
Do you think you can
get this chemist guy

01:33.460 --> 01:35.280
to tell you his name?

01:35.320 --> 01:38.448
Gonna try my level best.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.769
Come on, let's get the taste of
that bad man out of your mouth.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.234
Thought he was gonna
rip his arm off.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.579
Yeah, Pazir thought so,
too, way he was screaming.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.738
Maybe Pazir
just isn't a dog person.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.668
Maybe he knows the prophet
said they were unclean.

01:57.710 --> 01:58.802
What's he say
about heroin?

01:58.850 --> 02:01.171
Everybody decent?

02:01.220 --> 02:02.710
Whoa, when'd you become
so delicate, huh?

02:02.750 --> 02:04.809
The agency keeps sending
HR memos warning us

02:04.850 --> 02:07.216
not to make our operators
feel objectified.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.682
Mm. What happens if
we ask real nice?

02:10.690 --> 02:13.488
Okay, um...
so, did Pazir

02:13.530 --> 02:16.226
say anything before you guys
handed him over to the MP5?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.498
I think
his loose translation was...

02:18.630 --> 02:22.259
Oh, you know, he wasn't too
chatty, that's for sure.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.607
Yeah, in fairness, we did

02:23.640 --> 02:25.335
kick in his door
at 2:00 in the morning,

02:25.370 --> 02:27.474
shwack his bodyguards,
and sic a dog on him, so...

02:27.510 --> 02:29.808
"In fairness."

02:29.850 --> 02:31.806
All right. Get some sleep.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.273
Oh, oh, wait a second.
What about you?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.617
Don't you need
to get some sleep?

02:35.650 --> 02:36.878
I'm gonna go see
if Pazir will talk to me.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.253
You really think he's gonna tell
you who owns that poppy field?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.757
I'm not the one who
sicced a dog on him.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.655
JASON:
Good point.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.423
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
I'm not looking at anything.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.325
Put your pants on.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.368
C_LAY:
Hey, little lady.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.401
STELLA:
Hey. You look exhausted.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.271
You guys went again?

03:00.310 --> 03:02.278
Yeah. We actually had
a pretty good night, though.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.778
That's great.
Is it snowing there yet?

03:04.810 --> 03:09.247
'Cause I saw that there was
a 60% chance of snow.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.384
I, uh...
I hear they have an opening

03:14.620 --> 03:17.350
What? I set my app--
my-my weather app-- to J-Bad.

03:17.390 --> 03:18.880
Makes me feel more connected.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.751
I, uh, I wouldn't mind
connecting right now.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.597
Me, too.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.892
I miss you, babe.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.739
Damn it.

03:26.770 --> 03:29.364
I forgot I promised Gordon
I'd meet him for drinks.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.365
Gordon, huh?

03:30.410 --> 03:31.365
Yeah, Professor Turner.

03:31.410 --> 03:32.502
He's my advisor.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.871
Come on, we've been over this.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.878
So what, he, uh, he advises you
on drinking now?

03:35.910 --> 03:37.502
I'm helping him with his article

03:37.550 --> 03:39.347
for New Literary History.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.608
It's actually
really, really flattering

03:40.650 --> 03:41.844
that he wants my input.
Yeah.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.541
Yeah, I'm sure
that's all he wants.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.683
Right, 'cause there's only thing
that I have to offer.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.381
Immw.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.752
That's not what I meant.

03:49.790 --> 03:52.520
It's just, last week, it was,
you know, it was midterms.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.891
The week before,
it was his lecture...

03:53.930 --> 03:56.899
Yeah, because that's my job,
babe, you know?

03:56.930 --> 03:58.898
I get paid to do these things.

03:58.930 --> 03:59.965
It just kind of
seems like the guy

04:00.000 --> 04:02.309
can't do anything without you
since I left town.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.467
Why, Mr. Spenser, am I detecting
a hint of jealousy?

04:04.510 --> 04:06.899
Well, I mean, how would you feel
if-if, you know, I was

04:06.940 --> 04:09.670
hanging out with some woman
all the time you didn't know?

04:09.710 --> 04:13.419
Well, I... Iwould hope
that I would trust you,

04:13.450 --> 04:16.317
like people do
in grown-up relationships.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.509
Seriously?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.811
You're laughing right now?

04:21.860 --> 04:23.452
No.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.424
Well, how you doing there,
Miss Stella?

04:25.460 --> 04:26.427
Huh?

04:26.460 --> 04:27.654
Hey.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.567
I just want to let you know
we're taking care of your, uh...

04:30.600 --> 04:31.919
your young buck right now.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.699
He's a big old
stud out here.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.367
Thank you so much

04:35.400 --> 04:36.799
for wearing something
under that robe this time.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.807
Yeah.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.808
It's America right here.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.376
in the middle of
something right now, man.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.843
Yeah.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.916
Come on, you think
I just got dressed up like this

04:47.950 --> 04:49.918
for no reason

04:49.950 --> 04:51.679
He is not well.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.358
Well, uh...

04:53.390 --> 04:54.357
good night, there, Stella.

04:54.390 --> 04:55.414
Have a good one.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.349
Later, cowboy.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.893
I'll, uh, I'll just go
to my room.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.495
Actually, I should go, too.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.538
Yeah, yeah,
'cause we wouldn't want

05:08.570 --> 05:09.867
to keep Gordon waiting, right?

05:09.910 --> 05:10.934
Come on, don't do that.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.609
I need to go, and you need
to go get some sleep,

05:13.640 --> 05:16.006
slow those long-distance
relationship gears from turning.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.373
Okay? We'll talk about your
paranoid fantasies tomorrow.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.020
JASON:
Hey, it's me.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.824
Listen, I... I really don't know
how this works,

05:33.860 --> 05:36.624
if there are rules
to me calling you

05:36.670 --> 05:38.626
or if you even want me
to call you.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.888
I don't know, maybe I should
just call the kids directly

05:40.940 --> 05:42.601
or... something like that.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.461
But anyhow,
we're really busy here,

05:45.510 --> 05:46.477
uh, as you can imagine,

05:46.510 --> 05:49.035
so give the kids my love
and a kiss, will you?

05:49.080 --> 05:51.776
Oh, look at that. Getting
the PT in early, huh?

05:51.810 --> 05:53.414
Rise and grind,
turn and burn.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.042
There you go.
Boss says run,

05:55.080 --> 05:57.412
I say, "How high?"
How high, yeah.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.418
Jason Hayes.
That's right.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.313
Alan Cutter.
Hey.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.920
He's the founder
of Xeon Tactical Security.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.451
Hi.
Yeah. I think we've got
some friends in common.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.696
Oh, is that right? At least one.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.425
Ah, that's right.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.927
Oh, and I think I'm told
that you, uh...

06:09.970 --> 06:12.438
we overlapped
for a short period in Baghdad,

06:12.470 --> 06:13.937
right, just before I left
the forces.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.063
22nd SAS?
"A" Squadron.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.658
That's right.
My-my misspent youth.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.837
Well, looks like you're
getting back into the fight.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.474
Oh, no. No, no, no. Mostly
from the sidelines these days.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.670
Though 1-1 will concede,

06:23.710 --> 06:25.075
it's a little bit
of a better tax bracket.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.078
So, I'm gonna

06:27.120 --> 06:29.680
let you guys visit, but I...
I hope you reach out

06:29.720 --> 06:31.688
when you finally hang up
the wet suit.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.688
I'm sure
we could find a position

06:33.720 --> 06:35.449
for a man of your reputation.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.821
We'll see.

06:36.860 --> 06:37.986
Take it easy.
Yeah.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.555
Yeah, later.
See ya.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.953
Not every day you meet
private contractor royalty.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.888
You know, I should have
worn my good suit.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.966
He's not that bad, really.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.696
He looks like a nice guy.
He's figured out

06:48.740 --> 06:50.833
how to be a capitalist,
still serve his country.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.474
I owe a lot to Alan.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.968
Well, you know what,
I should get going

06:55.010 --> 06:56.705
'cause I got to try
and get some sleep,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.741
which really just doesn't happen
for me that much, you know.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.645
Uh-huh. Real quick,
though, um...
Yeah.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.841
what does it take
to get a golden ticket

07:02.890 --> 07:04.778
to your Camp Larkin
frat house over there?

07:04.820 --> 07:06.082
Oh, that's years
of physically

07:06.120 --> 07:08.588
and emotionally
damaging training,

07:08.620 --> 07:10.724
but I tell you what.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.558
: If you
ask really nicely,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.556
maybe I can pull
some strings.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.728
That's too bad,
'cause I-I got a personal policy

07:18.770 --> 07:21.591
about begging
before breakfast, so...

07:21.640 --> 07:23.801
how about I just give you this.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.058
You figure it out.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.544
Bye, Jason.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.571
Yeah, see ya.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.010
I told you,
I'm not from Jalalabad.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.553
I'm visiting from Kabul
to see my sister.

07:39.590 --> 07:40.909
And did your wife
travel with you?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.723
I'm not married.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.081
How often do you come here
to visit your sister?

07:45.130 --> 07:47.052
Once a year.
I told you.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.795
Once a year on your birthday?

07:48.830 --> 07:50.058
Correct.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.829
All right,
let's stop this nonsense.

07:53.570 --> 07:55.538
Your name is Pazir al-Mohammed.

07:55.570 --> 07:58.607
You were born July 1981
in Mihtarlam,

07:58.640 --> 08:00.608
where you still live
with your wife, Sepedah,

08:00.640 --> 08:02.904
and your children,
Badrawi and Saba.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.601
You come here to Jalalabad
once a month

08:05.650 --> 08:06.912
not to visit your sister,

08:06.950 --> 08:09.009
but to put
your fancy chemistry degree

08:09.050 --> 08:11.917
to work refining poppies.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.657
Also, here's
an interesting fact.

08:14.690 --> 08:16.555
One of the grows
you oversee

08:16.590 --> 08:19.127
was burnt out a few weeks ago
by a team of American commandos

08:19.160 --> 08:21.628
who were then targeted
and murdered.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.788
I sell electronics.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.732
Electronic salesmen don't sleep
in safe houses with bodyguards.

08:30.740 --> 08:33.629
Now, this is from
the field in question

08:33.680 --> 08:35.807
before it was burned.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.671
And this, I believe, is you.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.575
Now can we talk?

08:41.220 --> 08:44.212
Okay, I didn't have anything
to do with killing Americans.

08:44.250 --> 08:47.959
Okay. I believe you.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.982
I just need to know
who owns this field.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.949
My boss.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.663
Right. Who's your boss?

08:59.700 --> 09:01.634
I've never met him.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.729
You're one of a handful of men

09:05.770 --> 09:08.170
who knows how to refine poppies
into heroin

09:08.210 --> 09:09.677
on an industrial scale.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.747
A man with your
valuable skill set

09:12.780 --> 09:15.044
has most certainly
met the boss.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.843
So help me now,

09:16.890 --> 09:19.859
maybe you get out of prison
before you're an old man.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.108
I know what's going
to happen to me.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.252
I'm at peace.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.679
No, you're scared.
Understandably.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.197
You work for dangerous people.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.767
You're the dangerous people.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.098
This is your burner phone.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.199
No names, just numbers.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.129
Maybe I should start dialing,
telling everybody

09:41.180 --> 09:43.000
how cooperative you've been
with the Americans.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.699
No_ one will
believe you.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.978
Maybe not.
But what happens

09:46.010 --> 09:48.911
when our assets on the ground
start whispering the same thing?

09:48.950 --> 09:51.214
Rumors get back to the people
that you work with.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.889
Think they'll give you
the benefit of the doubt?
You can't.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.989
My children.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.749
Ithought
you didn't have a family.

09:56.790 --> 09:59.122
He will kill them.
You love your wife, Pazir?

09:59.160 --> 10:01.196
You share things with her?
Work things?

10:01.230 --> 10:03.824
Okay. She does not know
who I work for.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.691
The man you work for
killed six American soldiers.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.709
He'll bury anybody he thinks
that can point us to them.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.230
Including your family.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.931
They know nothing.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.029
You think
he'll take that chance?

10:16.080 --> 10:20.972
It seems to me your best hope
is to work with me

10:21.020 --> 10:25.719
to help us get to him
before he can get to Sepedah,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.957
Badrawi and Saba.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.035
You know the name
Musa Ghani?

10:43.070 --> 10:45.300
Musa Ghani?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.103
Of course I do.

10:47.140 --> 10:50.041
He's one of the biggest
drug dealers on the planet.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.742
That's the man I work for.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.423
Every time we're in J-Bad,
somebody offers up Musa Ghani.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.995
SONNY: The guy might as well
have said he dimed out Bigfoot.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.689
Pazir's story
checks out so far.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.208
Sorry. So Echo Team burns
one of Ghani's fields,

11:17.240 --> 11:18.832
so he decides
to burn them?

11:18.870 --> 11:20.337
Why not?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.109
It is nice
and linear.
This guy Ghani

11:22.140 --> 11:24.244
has got, what, over a hundred
fields all over the place.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.046
You think he's gonna go off
when he sees one of them burn?

11:28.080 --> 11:30.014
What we can tell,
Ghani's been hit pretty hard

11:30.050 --> 11:31.745
by the new interdiction program.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.213
Maybe he decided
it was time to push back.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.024
Interdiction program's mostly
run by those contractors, right?

11:37.060 --> 11:38.379
I mean, so-so why's
he target Echo?

11:38.430 --> 11:41.024
Maybe the field that Echo
burned was the last straw.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.199
Maybe he figured killing a half
a dozen Tier One operators

11:43.230 --> 11:45.289
was a good way to throw
a scare into everybody.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.060
What about this guy Pazir, huh?
You believe him?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.307
I believe he's real
scared of something.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.035
He give up more
than a name?

11:52.070 --> 11:53.276
What makes you say that?

11:53.310 --> 11:55.278
You wouldn't have
got us out of bed

11:55.310 --> 11:57.471
just because Pazir claimed
to know Mr. Snuffleupagus.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.205
He gave us a phone number.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.842
Says he uses it
to speak to Ghani.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.245
Directly?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.089
No one speaks
directly to Ghani.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.214
He says the phone belongs
to Bashir, the security chief.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.285
_ JASON_: _
DaVIs, you ping It?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.457
Nothing so far.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.253
He probably keeps the battery
out when he's not using it.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.791
That's exactly why we need
a secondary confirmation

12:13.830 --> 12:14.899
that this is Khan's phone.

12:14.930 --> 12:15.999
JASON:
Well, how the hell we gonna

12:16.030 --> 12:18.760
do that when the guy just-just
has his phone shut off?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.291
MANDY: Bashir's mistress
lives in an apartment

12:21.340 --> 12:24.059
above a spice market in
the Buhara neighborhood.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.259
Well, can we get a drone
over the place?

12:25.310 --> 12:26.265
DAVIS:
Already done.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.107
Problem is,
Bashir is very careful

12:28.140 --> 12:30.347
about not exposing himself
to open sky.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.405
I say we just get a surveillance
team into the market.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.543
I asked. Command said
there's nothing available.

12:34.580 --> 12:35.569
All right,
you know what? Fine.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.781
We just do this ourselves,
all right?
I'm game.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.117
Yup, he's game.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.084
Daylight close recon,
that neighborhood?

12:41.120 --> 12:42.257
Like stirring up
a hornet's nest.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.121
Anyway, you don't have
the personnel.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.799
You got one Pashto speaker, one
guy who could pass for something

12:46.830 --> 12:48.320
besides America_n--
not gonna cut It.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.396
Okay, fine. Why don't we just
send in Little Orphan Annie?

12:50.430 --> 12:52.295
Mm.
You want to send Dorri in there?

12:52.330 --> 12:54.332
Why not? Well, she was
a Taliban courier.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.395
We know she's used to being
in dangerous places.
Mm-hmm.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.204
Exactly. What if she was used
to send messages to Ghani?

12:59.240 --> 13:00.434
Bashir might recognize her.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.769
It's... it's hard
to see a better option.

13:10.150 --> 13:13.813
DAVIS: Okay, this is the man
we're looking for-- Bashir Khan.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.919
These two are gonna be
nearby just in case

13:15.960 --> 13:19.259
you get into trouble, but
they cannot enter the market.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.896
This camera's gonna be
streaming video the whole time,

13:25.930 --> 13:27.466
so you don't need
to do anything.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.933
Just find Bashir.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.506
Soon as you get a
good look at him,

13:30.540 --> 13:33.179
head straight back to
the car, you understand?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.248
I understand.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.165
ERIC:
QRF, be advised.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.936
Asset has
entered market.

13:59.970 --> 14:00.937
Copy, TOC.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.006
If this thing goes bad,
it's gonna happen fast.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.338
Stand by to pull
them out of there.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.975
Roger that.
QRF, standing by.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.171
Here we go, boys.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.438
Standing by.
Come on, Sonny.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.414
I don't get it, boss.
What don't you get?

14:13.450 --> 14:14.542
Ithoughtthe
whole point

14:14.580 --> 14:17.413
of using assets is so
we didn't have to risk our guys.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.884
Even if the asset is
a scared little girl

14:19.920 --> 14:21.319
protecting her brother?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.885
Yeah. Everybody's
got their reasons.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.421
The last time I checked
in my rule book,

14:26.460 --> 14:29.429
you run errands for terrorists,
you're a terrorist.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.394
That is cold.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.399
Tell me what you see, brother.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.466
Hmm.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.229
I got two military-age males
watching the shoppers.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.602
Any chance one of them's Bashir,
we get to go home early?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.676
No. Sorry.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.519
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

14:48.550 --> 14:50.438
We have two military-age males
inside the marketplace,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.344
appear to be standing watch.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.381
Copy, 2.
Any sign of the HVT?

14:54.420 --> 14:56.058
RAY:
That's a negative.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.559
ERIC:
Roger that. Keep us posted.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.947
I really don't like the way
this guy's looking at her.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.457
Think he could have made her?

15:27.490 --> 15:28.559
Well, it's possible.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.290
He's start... he's starting
to move toward her.

15:37.330 --> 15:39.560
TOC, be advised, one of the MAMs
is approaching the asset.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.465
ERIC:
Roger. QRF standing by.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.637
No.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.499
You want me to reach out
and touch him?

15:51.550 --> 15:53.609
No. Let it play.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.618
Hey, is it just my imagination,
or does it look like

16:00.660 --> 16:02.412
he's trying to pick up on her?

16:06.030 --> 16:08.396
No, that's not your imagination.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.489
I just don't know
if it's good news.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.395
You think he knows
that she's a she?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.489
I think_a man who
lives in a place

16:14.540 --> 16:16.633
where he doesn't know any
women who aren't his relatives

16:16.670 --> 16:20.128
might think a hairless boy
is good enough.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.041
How do you want to play it?

16:29.050 --> 16:31.587
How do you say
"He's mine" in Pashto?

16:31.620 --> 16:34.088
We're not supposed
to get out of the car.
He's mine.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.755
All right. Be ready
to get behind the wheel.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.655
We might have to leave on a hop.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.463
All right.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.389
Bravo 6, this is TOC.
ISR appears to show

16:46.430 --> 16:49.433
Bravo 2 exiting the vehicle.
Please advise.

16:49.470 --> 16:51.461
That's affirmative.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.705
Son of a bitch.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.069
No, no.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.507
MAN:
Hey!

17:44.790 --> 17:47.497
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.748
We have positive
ID. on Bashir Khan.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.825
Mission accomplished.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.298
MANDY: Yes, sir. Bashir
put the battery back

17:59.340 --> 18:01.399
in his cell phone as soon
as they left the market.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.270
We're tracking them now.

18:02.310 --> 18:03.868
They're headed northeast
on Konar Road,

18:03.910 --> 18:07.118
towards Pakistan, that's right.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.448
Well, our intel suggests
that Ghani likes

18:09.480 --> 18:11.482
to move between safe houses,
but he never likes

18:11.520 --> 18:14.455
to spend the night unless
Bashir is there to protect him.

18:14.490 --> 18:17.323
Only one he really trusts.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.328
Thank you, sir.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.691
I hope so, too.

18:20.730 --> 18:24.393
This guy Bashir,
he's a total badass, right?

18:24.430 --> 18:26.364
That's his rep.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.436
Figure that's why Ghani
trusts him with his safety?

18:28.470 --> 18:30.506
Well, he employs Western-style
layered security.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.338
He builds heaw-weapon
fighting positions outside

18:33.380 --> 18:34.278
all of his safe houses.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.369
I read the same brief.
What's your point?

18:36.410 --> 18:38.344
Point is, the problem with
following Bashir to Ghani is

18:38.380 --> 18:40.519
you got to go through Bashir
to get to Ghani.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.386
One thing at a time.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.285
TRENT:
So if the bodyguard

18:49.320 --> 18:51.481
leads us to Ghani, we're going
out again tonight, right?

18:51.530 --> 18:53.498
Yeah, no rest
for the wicked.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.498
Or the whipped.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.566
Ain't that right, Mr. Spenser?

18:57.600 --> 19:02.333
Yeah, I'd just be glad to get
some payback for the Echo guys.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.406
Amen to that. Here.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.362
Wherever we're going,

19:06.410 --> 19:09.334
you always need to carry
extra breaching charges.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.348
Put them in your leg pouch.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.245
Nah, it's cool.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.646
Actually, I, um, prefer
to have my body plate armor

19:17.690 --> 19:19.419
in between me and my explosives.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.613
This op is gonna be
quick and dirty,

19:22.660 --> 19:26.323
and you may not have time
to reach back and get them.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.328
Okay?

19:28.360 --> 19:32.592
Put them in your leg pouch.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.790
Yeah, I've been doing it
this way for years, Sonny.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.297
It's not gonna be an issue.

19:36.340 --> 19:40.299
You need to listen to me
on this one, new guy.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.774
You know, I might have been
the new guy after BUDs,

19:42.810 --> 19:45.540
might have been the new guy
after Green Team, right?

19:45.580 --> 19:46.808
I might be the newest
guy here on Bravo.

19:46.850 --> 19:49.569
But I'm not a new guy, so you
can stop treating me like one.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.680
Wow. Look at this.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.449
The millennial snowflake

19:54.490 --> 19:57.482
just seems to have
all the answers.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.795
No. I just know
you don't have any.

20:02.530 --> 20:06.762
Oh. We got a problem?

20:06.800 --> 20:09.530
No, we are good,
Senior Chief.

20:09.570 --> 20:12.266
RAY: We're closing in
on the guy who ordered

20:12.310 --> 20:14.301
the hit on our brothers,
and you two are more concerned

20:14.340 --> 20:15.500
with marking territory?

20:15.540 --> 20:17.542
Listen to me. Hey!

20:17.580 --> 20:19.571
Put it away now.

20:19.610 --> 20:22.613
After we get Ghani
in the ground, in a cell,

20:22.650 --> 20:26.313
you two still want to go at it,
we'll settle it in the ring.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.284
That works for me.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.550
Anytime, anywhere.

20:32.590 --> 20:33.818
RAY:
Okay.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.403
We got something.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.862
There's Bashir.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.775
Yeah, I'm going in tighter.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.878
MANDY:
This one.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.810
Can you get a clean view?
I'm trying.

20:53.850 --> 20:57.513
I'm trying.

20:57.550 --> 21:00.348
That's a positive
ID. on Musa Ghani.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.779
Yes, sir, we have confirmed
HVT on target.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.629
Requesting green light.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.021
AMY:
So, they actually exist, huh?

21:12.070 --> 21:12.968
Proud papa.

21:13.000 --> 21:13.932
Yeah.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.039
Yeah, well,

21:15.070 --> 21:16.537
more like an uncle.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.037
I inherited these.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.037
Oh.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.708
Among other things, I imagine.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.710
So, I have to ask
how you got past the gate?

21:27.750 --> 21:29.638
Oh, yeah, that.
Guess the guards--

21:29.680 --> 21:33.047
they all know me, 'cause,
uh, I was a friend of Steve's.

21:33.090 --> 21:35.957
I probably
should have told you.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.458
Right. So, we need
to talk about that?

21:38.490 --> 21:41.027
I mean, you and Steve--
you weren't, uh, you know?

21:41.060 --> 21:43.324
No, not that kind of friend.
H... I have rules.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.723
Steve was married.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.397
So are you.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.739
Not married. Separated.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.965
Separated?
Mm-hmm.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.399
Separated's still
married, though.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.977
It's too bad, 'cause
I was gonna invite you over

21:56.010 --> 21:57.443
to come and see my garden.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.448
But you have rules.
But I got rules.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.811
Got rules.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.442
Yeah.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.482
Oh.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.715
Yeah. I got to get
back to work.

22:06.750 --> 22:07.978
Okay.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.819
Nice shorts,
by the way.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.054
All right, over
the last few weeks,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.920
we've been slowly making
our way up the ladder

22:15.960 --> 22:18.064
to find those responsible
for taking out Echo Team.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.934
I'm pleased to say that we
think we've reached the top.

22:21.970 --> 22:23.938
And his name is Musa Ghani.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.006
Ms. Ellis.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.905
As most of you are aware,

22:27.940 --> 22:30.875
Bravo Team located
Ghani's personal bodyguard,

22:30.910 --> 22:32.878
Bashir Khan, earlier today.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.140
ISR's tracked him
to this safe house

22:35.180 --> 22:37.580
in the foothills
of the Hindu Kush.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.780
A few minutes ago,

22:38.820 --> 22:43.109
we positively identified
Ghani on site.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.149
_ ERIC: It's the
big one, gentlemen.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.078
It's the end
of the rainbow.
JASON: Okay, look,

22:46.130 --> 22:47.893
if Ghani's there,
he's not gonna be there long,

22:47.930 --> 22:49.693
so we're gonna speed over
security on this one.

22:49.730 --> 22:51.027
Hey, Alpha, Bravo Team,
you helo into the target,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.662
you fast-rope in,
got it?

22:52.700 --> 22:53.962
In and out, quick and dirty.
That's right.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.967
Sonny, don't you dare.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.695
CLAY:
Remote area like that,

22:56.740 --> 22:58.708
you know they're
gonna hear us coming.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.707
Well, we'll just launch
multiple helos,

22:59.740 --> 23:01.435
and we'll do false inserts
across the valley.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.879
Should buy us some time.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.969
SONNY: It's time we showed
this rat-faced Ghani

23:05.010 --> 23:07.774
that payback
is a bitch.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.173
Right? All right, listen up.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.916
I know that this mission
means a lot to all of us,

23:11.950 --> 23:14.885
but let's not let vengeance
cloud our focus, all right?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.013
I'm gonna do my best to
not let it cloud mine.

23:17.060 --> 23:18.789
Happy hunting, fellas.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.183
Jace.
JASON: Yeah?

23:20.230 --> 23:22.824
What?

23:22.860 --> 23:25.192
You guys have been turnin'
and burnin' for the last week.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.788
Yeah. Come on, Eric,
you kidding me?

23:26.830 --> 23:27.831
Come on, nothing.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.929
You know as well as I do,
Jason, what happens

23:29.970 --> 23:32.666
when guys start to slip because
they're too tired to op,

23:32.710 --> 23:34.871
too emotional _to
make good deCI5ions.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.878
Look, if any of your guys
are acting squirrelly,

23:36.910 --> 23:38.707
now is the time
to call them out.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.741
You know, I appreciate that,
but we're solid, okay?

23:40.780 --> 23:42.873
Not every day
we get to make things right,

23:42.920 --> 23:44.911
and we're gonna
make things right.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.829
Steve Porter's unit patch.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.896
You go get that bastard.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.228
For the Brotherhood.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.195
Brotherhood.
I won't let them down.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.831
Let's go.
Come on.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.689
Let's go get 'em, baby!

24:21.720 --> 24:23.051
Come on, let's go, boys.
Sonny, you ready?

24:23.090 --> 24:24.955
Let's go.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.608
What the hell?
What's going on?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.145
Not going anywhere.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.716
CIA pulled the plug.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.286
Sorry, fellas,
mission's been scrubbed.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.288
What are you talking about?

24:55.320 --> 24:58.926
Get your boys back on the bus.
I'll meet you at Larkin.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.951
*

25:17.680 --> 25:20.069
Meanwhile, the BTF's got
this guy so turned around,

25:20.110 --> 25:21.748
he's actually calling me
to authorize the contact,

25:21.780 --> 25:24.749
and I'm like, first off,
either Cortez drops...

25:24.790 --> 25:26.678
You want to tell me
why you canked my op?
Excuse me?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.813
I got 20 of my men
loaded on helos, okay?

25:28.860 --> 25:31.249
HVT confirmed on target,
and you pull the plug.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.155
Gentlemen,
Master Chief Jason Hayes,

25:33.190 --> 25:35.829
breacher extraordinaire,
as he has just demonstrated.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.589
Don't use that tone with me.

25:37.630 --> 25:38.665
Easy, Master...

25:40.800 --> 25:43.268
Gentlemen, excuse us.

25:47.110 --> 25:50.602
I canceled the op--
actually JSOC canceled your op

25:50.650 --> 25:53.301
because it turns out
your HVT is asset-conflicted.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.648
You're saying that the Agency
is protecting Ghani?

25:55.680 --> 25:57.170
Not us, actually.
VVho?

25:57.220 --> 25:58.642
DEA.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.180
DEA?
Mm-hmm.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.882
DEA is using the most brutal
killer in Eastern Afghanistan

26:02.920 --> 26:04.319
as an asset?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.225
Apparently, he's proven
himself quite valuable.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.592
Valuable how?
Huh

26:08.630 --> 26:10.666
By making us take out
the competitors?

26:10.700 --> 26:12.691
You understand this is
way above your clearance...

26:15.300 --> 26:18.201
Musa Ghani took out
SIX Tier One operators,

26:18.240 --> 26:21.607
six of my brothers, and you're
telling me I can't go after him

26:21.640 --> 26:23.801
because he's a snitch
for the DEA?

26:23.850 --> 26:25.374
I understand_how
important this is.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.913
To you. Frankly, to
the entire war effort.

26:27.950 --> 26:30.919
But someone wants
Ghani protected.

26:30.950 --> 26:31.848
There's nothing
I can do.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.346
Oh, yeah, there's
something you can do.

26:33.390 --> 26:34.812
You can authorize
my target package.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.213
I cannot go to bat
for you on some hunch.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.852
Not a hunch.
I know it's not a hunch.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.949
Ghani owns the poppy fields
that Echo Team torched.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.651
The cash hidden
on those same fields

26:41.700 --> 26:43.224
was used to pay the hit squad.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.966
I am telling you, Jason...

26:45.000 --> 26:47.639
I am telling you...

26:47.670 --> 26:49.695
it's not enough.

26:51.970 --> 26:55.235
Not to take down the DEA's
highest-level informant

26:55.280 --> 26:56.975
in this entire country.

26:57.010 --> 27:00.173
Good to see that _
your priorities are straight.

27:00.210 --> 27:02.212
Coward.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.418
Hey!

27:09.460 --> 27:11.223
Don't even start.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.158
Advice I might
have given you.

27:12.190 --> 27:14.351
Okay. What do you
expect me to do, huh?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.152
Just roll over and
play dead

27:16.200 --> 27:17.724
After coming this far?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.988
How much farther did
the Jason Hayes charm get you?

27:20.030 --> 27:21.793
Why don't you tell me?
I had to talk Belding

27:21.840 --> 27:24.434
out of filing a formal complaint
with General Shenko.

27:24.470 --> 27:25.835
Yeah, well, Belding's a weasel.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.673
Yes, he is.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.178
But he's my boss,
and a particular kind of weasel,

27:32.210 --> 27:34.770
one that I can manipulate
around to my point of view.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.014
All right.
So did you?

27:36.050 --> 27:38.189
Yeah, see, the whole thing
with manipulation

27:38.220 --> 27:39.744
is it's a lot less effective

27:39.790 --> 27:41.189
when a rage-aholic
in full battle gear

27:41.220 --> 27:42.881
comes in_
and rearranges his desk.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.751
I'm not giving up
after coming this far!

27:44.790 --> 27:46.428
I'm not asking you to!

27:46.460 --> 27:48.189
You know you're not
the only one

27:48.230 --> 27:49.458
who's come this far, Jason.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.295
All right, you know what,
you're right.

27:53.330 --> 27:54.831
I'm sorry. I lost it.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.293
I lost it.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.729
All right?

28:02.240 --> 28:04.208
Are you okay?

28:04.250 --> 28:07.208
Look, we are sleeping in
their beds, for God's sake.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.218
We have to follow
this through.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.309
And we will.

28:11.350 --> 28:15.218
What are you gonna
do about it

28:15.260 --> 28:17.251
I'm not sure.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.249
You're not the only one
who never gives up.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.418
You know,

28:41.450 --> 28:44.339
this thing where
you guys never sleep, it's...

28:44.390 --> 28:46.244
getting a little tired.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.258
A lot tired, actually.

28:48.290 --> 28:50.508
Wordplay at 4:30 in the morning.
Very impressive.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.348
Well, that's...
why they pay me the big bucks.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.958
I thought they paid you
the big bucks

28:56.000 --> 28:57.797
for high-profile access
that nobody else could get.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.320
Well, that, too,
but there hasn't been

28:59.370 --> 29:01.258
a whole lot of that
going around these days.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.836
Yeah, and I'm sorry.
That's too bad.

29:02.870 --> 29:04.360
Well, it's not
for lack of trying.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.503
Can I go back to sleep now?

29:06.540 --> 29:08.838
If you go to sleep,

29:08.880 --> 29:11.474
you might miss out
on some high-profile access.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.307
How high?

29:13.350 --> 29:14.840
How does an hour

29:14.880 --> 29:18.111
with a Tier One
master chief sound?

29:21.420 --> 29:24.423
Tier One guys
don't talk to reporters.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.398
So that's it?

29:28.430 --> 29:32.389
I get my interview with
Jason Hayes, and you get...?

29:32.430 --> 29:36.969
When was the last time
you spoke to your daddy,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.299
the congressman?

29:40.340 --> 29:42.501
ERIC:
All right, listen up.

29:42.540 --> 29:46.499
As most of you have heard,
we are back on for Musa Ghani.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.417
RAY: How the hell
she get to Belding?

29:50.450 --> 29:52.008
I softened him up
a little bit, huh?

29:52.050 --> 29:53.312
I'm not sure
I believe that.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.886
MANDY:
So, thanks to some higher-ups,

29:54.920 --> 29:56.410
we are back on for Ghani.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.429
Good news is ISR still has him
at the safe house.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.599
Five bad guys,
including Bashir and his thugs.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.996
And the bad news is...

30:04.030 --> 30:05.998
sun's
UP

30:06.030 --> 30:08.590
Yeah, bad news is we're looking
at a daylight assault.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.335
And there goes
our element of surprise

30:10.370 --> 30:11.200
and our technical advantage.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.128
Why don't we wait,
take 'em at night?

30:13.170 --> 30:14.899
That way, we got our
night vision back.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.009
Ooh-hoo, look at that.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.578
The rookie just figured out
asymmetrical warfare.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.441
Wow, buddy, that's
a lot of syllables for you.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.448
We don't want to risk waiting,

30:23.480 --> 30:25.584
because of how often
Ghani changes locations.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.417
Means an off-site infil.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.180
ERIC: Right. So, helo
will put you down here.

30:30.220 --> 30:32.085
Two klicks out.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.586
Okay, let's see
if we can catch them

30:33.630 --> 30:35.188
while they're still
sleeping. Let's go.

30:35.230 --> 30:37.095
ERIC:
Hey, one more thing.

30:37.130 --> 30:40.190
If Ghani does squirt off target,
we do not pursue him.

30:40.230 --> 30:41.891
It's a hostile environment
right there,

30:41.940 --> 30:45.159
and I don't want _to lose _
any other friends taking him in.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.929
*

30:49.540 --> 30:52.202
Feeling awful exposed out here
in the daylight like this, boss.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.616
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
We're passing Lincoln.

30:54.650 --> 30:57.039
ERIC:
Copy, Bravo 1. Enjoy the hike.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.955
Last man.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.463
RAY: No movement
at the target house, boss.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.092
Maybe Ghani's
a late riser.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.439
Yeah, he's probably
the real Bohemian type.

31:18.470 --> 31:20.938
Cut the chatter, all right?
Move it.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.971
*

31:42.560 --> 31:44.926
Contact front! Contact front!

31:47.500 --> 31:49.058
Move it!

31:59.310 --> 32:01.175
*

32:26.740 --> 32:29.129
Ray, where'd that come from?

32:29.180 --> 32:31.603
Mortar team, northeast corner
of the target building!

32:31.650 --> 32:33.174
Clay!
Yeah!

32:33.210 --> 32:35.678
Ray! Push left,
after that mortar team!

32:35.720 --> 32:38.041
Not happening right now.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.726
1, this is 6.
I'm heading up the hill.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.691
We got two squirters
out the back!

32:48.730 --> 32:51.619
Is it Ghani?!
I can't say!

32:51.670 --> 32:53.194
You know we don't
chase quIrters, boss.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.563
Got to be smart here, J.
Got to be smart!

32:56.600 --> 32:59.239
Son of a bitch, it's Ghani.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.338
I'm going after him.
SONNY: Rolling with you, boss!

33:02.380 --> 33:04.177
JASON:
Let's go! I'm ending this!

33:04.210 --> 33:06.747
This isn't the way, Jace!
Are you gonna cover us or what?

33:06.780 --> 33:08.611
On me.

33:08.650 --> 33:11.016
Three, two, one.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.659
Crazy bastard.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.806
Damn it, I told them not
to pursue the squirters.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.330
Mission's personal.

33:35.380 --> 33:38.076
Yeah, well, that's how
people get hurt.

33:38.110 --> 33:40.101
*

33:51.230 --> 33:53.050
The squirters stopped moving.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.297
Doubt they're
waving a white flag.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.561
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is TOC. Be advised
the targets have stopped moving,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.262
and appear to be taking up
defensive positions.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.565
Copy, TOC.
Continuing forward.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.601
Incoming!

34:21.790 --> 34:24.224
Man down. Bravo 3 is down.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.827
Bravo 3 is down. Man down.

34:33.870 --> 34:36.794
Sonny!
Yeah.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.831
Talk to me, man.
You good?
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.338
Talk to me, man. You good?
I'm good, I'm good. Go.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.369
Okay, move to cover.

34:42.410 --> 34:44.298
Go after Ghani. Go!
All right.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.387
This is Bravo 3. Ah, man.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.651
*

35:16.810 --> 35:17.799
Bashir!

35:22.420 --> 35:24.342
ERIC:
Alpha 1, you okay?

35:24.390 --> 35:26.688
All good here.

35:42.470 --> 35:45.405
TOC, this is Bravo 1. Jackpot.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.409
I say again, jackpot.

36:00.850 --> 36:03.580
*

36:32.750 --> 36:35.787
CLAY:
Bravo 3, you're clear to move.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.788
Nice shooting, kid.

36:48.800 --> 36:52.406
1, this is 2.
Target's secure.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.007
Copy, 2.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.406
Prepare to exfil.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.811
*

37:21.570 --> 37:23.561
*

37:38.320 --> 37:40.618
Yo, yo, hold up.
I'm inbound with video.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.481
This is gonna hurt.
Hold your breath.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.681
That's some tough talk there,
pretty boy.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.982
All righty. Can't say
I didn't warn you.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.520
Enough talk.
Let's get it on.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.858
20 bucks he screams.
No way.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.824
SONNY:
Damn it.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.690
Come on, Ray, go easy.
RAY: Trust me, brother.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.561
This is hurting me more
than it's hurting you.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.908
You guys know,
on our forward operating base,

38:00.940 --> 38:02.532
we do have these things
called doctors, right?

38:02.580 --> 38:05.743
By the time that they pull
all this frag out,

38:05.780 --> 38:07.975
and write up the paperwork
and discharge me,

38:08.010 --> 38:11.719
you sons of bitches are gonna
drink all the beer...

38:11.750 --> 38:13.638
Damn it!
My bad.

38:13.690 --> 38:15.612
My bad, my bad.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.549
I had a heavy hand,
man, I'm sorry.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.649
Ooh. Wait, hold on, hold on.
We got a monster.

38:20.690 --> 38:21.691
Monster right here.
RAY: Oh, yeah, that's good.

38:21.730 --> 38:24.028
CLAY: Come and get this one
off of my tweezer.

38:24.060 --> 38:27.598
(Sonny groaning,
others laughing)

38:27.630 --> 38:29.564
SONNY: Uh, dainty little
touch there, Mr. Spenser.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.931
RAY: Ooh.
SONNY: There is no way

38:30.970 --> 38:33.700
that Stella would ever leave
you for that professor.

38:33.740 --> 38:36.607
We good here?

38:39.880 --> 38:42.542
I'm good if we're good, Clay.

38:43.980 --> 38:47.347
Yeah, we're golden.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.649
JASON:
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, wait.
Listen up, everybody.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.055
Hey, give me a second.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.728
Now, I'm not...
I'm not one for speeches.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.694
I'm not, uh, but, you know,

38:59.730 --> 39:02.733
it's never easy when we lose
one of our own brothers.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.067
But, you know what,
finding the guy

39:04.100 --> 39:05.965
who's responsible
for taking them out,

39:06.010 --> 39:08.570
sweetest thing I've ever tasted
in a long time.

39:08.610 --> 39:09.804
Right?

39:09.840 --> 39:13.640
So, all right.
Here's to Rob Johnson.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.069
Richy Williams, right?

39:16.120 --> 39:17.644
Chris Hall.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.716
For Razor Ramon Garcia.

39:19.750 --> 39:20.717
OTHERS:
Razor Ramon.

39:20.750 --> 39:21.717
Right?
Garcia.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.818
Mikey Miller.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.987
Mikey, yeah.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.658
Steve Porter.

39:27.690 --> 39:30.625
Yes, sir, our fallen
Echo brothers.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.719
ERIC: All right,
I got one thing to say.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.068
The best of us
don't come home.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.796
To Echo Team.
ALL: Echo Team.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.677
All right, now remember,

39:42.710 --> 39:45.770
Steve used to say
when the drinking lamp is lit...

39:45.810 --> 39:47.072
ALL:
You should be, too!

39:51.120 --> 39:53.088
* Sears and Roebuck

39:53.120 --> 39:55.156
* Electric guitars...

39:58.830 --> 40:01.628
Yeah, remember when I asked
you if any of your guys

40:01.660 --> 40:04.049
were too emotionally involved
to make good decisions?

40:04.100 --> 40:05.328
What are you saying?

40:05.370 --> 40:08.635
That I shouldn't have gone after
the guy who killed our brothers?

40:08.670 --> 40:13.164
Think it's more recklessness
than I'm used to from you.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.871
Ghani is not our usual target.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.803
So this was isolated.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.717
Get back on target,
things go back to normal, right?

40:21.750 --> 40:24.787
Always.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.048
Back to normal.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.079
Yeah.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.088
* Where do we go?

40:29.120 --> 40:33.750
* Where do we go from here?

40:38.870 --> 40:41.794
JASON: Hey, look at you. You
deserve a beer more than anyone.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.193
Here you go.
Cheers to that.

40:43.240 --> 40:47.461
Right? So, you want to take
advantage of my afterglow

40:47.510 --> 40:49.205
and tell me what you
volunteered me for

40:49.240 --> 40:50.798
with the reporter?

40:52.650 --> 40:54.242
VVhat
Ghani's not talking?

40:54.280 --> 40:55.042
No, he's talking.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.241
The problem is
what he's saying.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.488
Ghani denies having anything to
do with the hit on Echo Team.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.181
Claims he sold the poppy field

41:02.220 --> 41:04.154
right after it was burned,
eight weeks ago.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.885
The guy's gonna say anything
to save his own ass.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.626
I know, but the intel
backs him up.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.854
Right after the
field was destroyed,

41:09.900 --> 41:11.925
he sold it for
pennies on the dollar.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.188
You got to be kidding me.
The money that you found
on that farm,

41:14.230 --> 41:15.834
not his.

41:15.870 --> 41:16.939
You kidding me?

41:16.970 --> 41:18.164
Who did Ghani
sell the field to?

41:18.200 --> 41:20.509
Some shell company.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.030
Still running it down, but...

41:22.080 --> 41:24.844
This is Afghanistan.
Mm-hmm.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.969
Just keep this between us
for now, all right?

41:29.020 --> 41:31.511
I don't want to ruin
the night for the boys.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.189
Yeah. Guess we all
deserve a night off.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.256
Yeah.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.949
You're not coming?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.525
Ah, no. I'm, uh...
Lost the mood.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.221
I-I'll catch up with you.
I got it. It's good.

41:47.270 --> 41:49.033
Okay.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.871
*

42:15.030 --> 42:17.021
*

42:42.120 --> 42:43.883
Hi.

42:47.230 --> 42:51.098
Ever just want to make it stop?

42:51.130 --> 42:55.169
Just... just for a while?
