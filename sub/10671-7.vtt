[acoustic rock music playing]

00:44.087 --> 00:46.006
[sizzling]

01:03.690 --> 01:08.069
Hey, man! You're up.

01:08.153 --> 01:10.906
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.408
There's coffee in the pot. Sumatra.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.828
Mmm.

01:28.048 --> 01:30.383
Like I've been in a coma.

01:30.467 --> 01:33.971
Yeah. Heavy shit will do that to a person.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.389
Yeah.

01:37.098 --> 01:40.185
[rock music playing]

02:14.678 --> 02:17.514
I can't remember the last time
you made me breakfast.

02:17.597 --> 02:20.433
- I think it was our honeymoon.
- [chuckling]

02:20.517 --> 02:24.021
So, man, have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

02:24.104 --> 02:27.148
With the store and with London?

02:28.067 --> 02:32.112
[sighs] Look, man, can I just... can I
just eat this, and then we'll get into it?

02:32.195 --> 02:34.823
Yeah. Yeah, man. Sorry.

02:39.995 --> 02:41.454
It kind of makes sense, though.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.375
What does?

02:45.458 --> 02:48.128
She was always asking
questions about you.

02:48.211 --> 02:51.798
No matter what it was that we were doing,
she would always bring it back to you.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.676
Uh-huh.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.678
Yeah, it really burned me up at the time.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.847
Now that I know
that she had sinister intentions,

02:58.931 --> 03:00.933
I don't feel so rejected.

03:03.518 --> 03:04.811
That's great, man.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.856
Good for you.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.775
You know, all things being equal,

03:09.858 --> 03:13.319
there's a good chance that she might
have gone for me instead of you.

03:14.947 --> 03:17.365
- But I guess we'll never know.
- I guess not.

03:18.158 --> 03:19.910
- Police! On the floor!
- Whoa, what the fuck?

03:19.993 --> 03:21.828
- Oh, fuck, George!
- Hey, man!

03:21.912 --> 03:23.538
[laughing]

03:23.622 --> 03:25.665
- Man, put the fucking gun down!
- Whoa! Put the gun down.

03:28.710 --> 03:29.544
Oh, my God.

03:31.588 --> 03:33.381
Yeah.

03:33.465 --> 03:34.925
Fuck, man.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.594
- Geez.
- Oh!

03:38.845 --> 03:41.140
That was good, Chip.

03:42.515 --> 03:43.892
[Dennis] Want a plate?

03:43.976 --> 03:47.062
No, man, I'm good. I ate already.
About a couple hours ago.

03:47.146 --> 03:49.856
Didn't see you boys
at the meeting this morning.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.109
Right.

03:55.112 --> 03:58.782
He doesn't want to talk about it.
He just wants to eat his breakfast.

03:58.865 --> 04:02.786
No, I get that. You can take a beat,
circle the wagons.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.166
What do you think, George?
I think she's coming here to sue.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.625
For what?

04:08.708 --> 04:11.211
Wrongful death.
Negligible homicide.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.922
- Negligent.
- Right.

04:14.006 --> 04:18.051
Unless somebody killed you,
that would be negligible homicide.

04:18.135 --> 04:20.846
No, I think she's going
to take him to court

04:20.928 --> 04:22.514
and try to make him pay
for what he did.

04:22.597 --> 04:23.890
- I already paid my dues.
- You did.

04:23.974 --> 04:28.478
I stood in front of a judge and I admitted
what I'd done... that I killed a man.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.063
- Yeah.
- I killed her brother.

04:30.271 --> 04:34.109
And I... I never flinched.
I never once tried to shift blame.

04:34.193 --> 04:37.320
- No, you took it head on.
- And I got the help that I needed,

04:37.403 --> 04:39.322
and... and I got sober,
and now, I help others.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.699
You helped me.

04:40.782 --> 04:43.118
Now, she wants to come here,
years later, and... and...

04:43.202 --> 04:45.162
[Dennis] What? Try to squeeze you
for a few bucks?

04:45.245 --> 04:47.330
Sounds like you guys got it
all figured out.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.456
- It makes sense.
- It does.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.001
Everyone's always trying to put
a price on their emotional loss.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.502
Is she stupid?

04:53.461 --> 04:54.713
What do you mean?

04:54.796 --> 04:57.340
Look, you said she was here
for a payout, right?

04:57.423 --> 04:59.634
I mean, after she tracked you down,

04:59.718 --> 05:03.847
how long you think before she figured out
that, you know, the well is dry?

05:05.598 --> 05:08.518
Well, just because
Chip doesn't have any...

05:08.601 --> 05:12.438
just because it may seem that
he has not accumulated financial wealth,

05:12.522 --> 05:14.566
that doesn't mean
that she can't put a line on him.

05:14.649 --> 05:15.859
On what?

05:15.942 --> 05:18.486
- Well, they could garnish his wages.
- [stifled laugh]

05:20.613 --> 05:25.077
What wages? They sold the store.
You got nothing now.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.995
Then, what is she here for?

05:28.371 --> 05:30.331
She's here to haunt you.

05:33.585 --> 05:35.045
- Like a ghost?
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.589 --> 05:39.758
She's just here rattling her chains.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.927
Whoa.

05:42.010 --> 05:44.054
That's...

05:44.137 --> 05:46.181
That's kind of, uh...

05:47.348 --> 05:48.349
Shit.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.977
That's the only explanation there is.

05:55.274 --> 05:57.358
You got any more of these fried potatoes?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.697
Hey. It's me.

06:04.783 --> 06:07.035
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

06:09.579 --> 06:12.749
I... I still don't know. I... I just...

06:12.832 --> 06:15.043
Yeah, just a bit more time.

06:15.127 --> 06:21.049
I just... I wanted to call because...
'cause it's our big day, and, um...

06:21.133 --> 06:23.969
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm thinking about you.

06:25.178 --> 06:28.056
No, David, I don't want
to speak to your mom.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.225
Hi! Hey!

06:30.309 --> 06:34.146
How are you?
How's the swollen ankle?

06:34.229 --> 06:38.858
- All right, just don't split this time.
- No way, man. I would never let you down.

06:47.492 --> 06:50.996
Oh, hey. Let me get
a number one Happy Meal.

06:51.079 --> 06:52.580
Cooler...

06:53.165 --> 06:54.624
[woman on intercom]
<i>Can I help you?</i>

06:54.707 --> 06:56.793
Yeah, I'm here to see Tilly.

06:56.876 --> 06:59.504
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

06:59.587 --> 07:02.757
Uh, no, but I'm... I'm her husband.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.552
<i>I'm sorry.
She asked not to be disturbed.</i>

07:08.596 --> 07:12.892
Can you just tell her it's me and...
and that I need to talk to her?

07:12.976 --> 07:15.103
<i>I'm sorry.
She asked not to be disturbed.</i>

07:15.187 --> 07:17.105
This is important!

07:18.564 --> 07:19.941
<i>She asked not to be disturbed.</i>

07:26.198 --> 07:28.700
Dude, sounds like
she doesn't want to see you.

07:28.783 --> 07:30.952
- [engine starting]
- Maybe next time just call her

07:31.036 --> 07:33.621
so I don't have to drive us
all the way out here.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.834
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.211
I'm sorry.

07:41.963 --> 07:46.301
It's actually pretty hard to hear.
It sounds like... are you at a party?

07:48.387 --> 07:51.806
Oh, you... you went ahead
with the reception.

07:53.308 --> 07:57.812
No, no, no. Yeah. You...
you did pay for the room. Yeah.

07:58.938 --> 08:01.566
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

08:04.277 --> 08:05.320
[sighs]

08:06.405 --> 08:08.323
Okay. Gotta go.

08:14.495 --> 08:18.250
[Kara] ...support and sign this,
though, you know, thanks.

08:18.333 --> 08:22.045
- Save Venice! Sign a petition. No?
- No, thank you.

08:22.128 --> 08:24.714
- Hey! I was going to call you.
- Oh, yeah?

08:24.797 --> 08:26.383
Yeah. What are you doing later?

08:26.466 --> 08:29.510
Uh, nothing. Got no plans.
Why? You want to do something?

08:29.594 --> 08:31.054
A bunch of us are going
to march down Abbot Kinney

08:31.137 --> 08:32.679
to protest that hotel development.

08:32.764 --> 08:35.433
- You should come.
- Okay. Yeah. Uh, what time?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.893
Here.

08:36.976 --> 08:41.356
"Save Nice"?
How do I... how do I do that?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.110
So, you and Chip, huh?

08:45.985 --> 08:49.155
Yeah, yeah.
We got back together.

08:49.864 --> 08:50.698
Mm.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.159
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

08:53.243 --> 08:56.455
- Like what?
- Like that. Like I've been played.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.125
I haven't. He's going through
a legitimately tough time right now.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.461
Yeah, okay. You mean the store?

09:03.169 --> 09:05.964
Yeah, the store and... that's part of it.

09:06.047 --> 09:09.134
There's just...
There's a lot of other shit, too.

09:09.759 --> 09:10.843
So...?

09:10.927 --> 09:13.054
Look, he's not a bad guy, okay?

09:13.138 --> 09:15.640
He's going through
a lot of turmoil right now.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.642
So, take it easy on him, yeah?

09:19.478 --> 09:20.520
All right.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.772
We can't blame other people
for our own unhappiness.

09:24.065 --> 09:27.568
- Did Chip say that?
- I don't... Yeah, probably.

09:27.652 --> 09:30.696
Right. Well, I have to go. I don't
want to be late for the first day of work.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.365
- Right.
- See you later. Bye.

09:32.449 --> 09:34.993
- Yeah. "Save Nice."
- Yes!

09:36.119 --> 09:40.581
I don't think I've ever counted
to more than, like, six hundred before.

09:41.416 --> 09:43.876
Whoa, man. Shit.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.379
That's not a good sign.

09:46.463 --> 09:48.006
Looks like they sold your store.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.175
- [Chip] I'm on it.
- Sweet!

09:51.426 --> 09:54.429
Cooler, I need you to run this
over to Wiener-Kaufmann.

09:54.513 --> 09:57.182
- What? Why me? What'd I do?
- Well, you have a car.

09:57.265 --> 09:59.518
And it's a job that even you
might not fuck up.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.062
Come on, man. I just got here.
Check out that sweet spot I just kojacked.

10:03.146 --> 10:03.938
Sorry.

10:04.063 --> 10:06.274
Can't we email the box
just to be more environmental?

10:06.358 --> 10:07.400
No.

10:07.484 --> 10:09.610
- Can I get gas money, at least?
- Nope.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.614
[woman] Hello, Chip.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.121
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- [groans]

10:20.205 --> 10:21.831
That's no way to speak to a lady.

10:22.957 --> 10:24.959
You're right.

10:25.043 --> 10:27.170
What the fuck are you doing here?

10:27.253 --> 10:29.088
Fuck, man.
You're Vanessa Weiss.

10:29.172 --> 10:31.049
The super agent!

10:31.132 --> 10:35.178
I sent you a tape a couple years ago
'cause I'm, like... I dabble in stand-up,

10:35.261 --> 10:37.347
but mainly my thing is, like, drama.

10:37.430 --> 10:40.308
- A tape?
- Yeah. I guess it's, like, ten years ago,

10:40.392 --> 10:43.520
but did you get a chance
to look at that yet?

10:43.603 --> 10:45.397
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

10:47.440 --> 10:48.733
Step out of my office.

10:53.738 --> 10:57.742
- [sighs] Do you...? Cooler...
- Right, yeah. Sorry.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.161
Hey, this has been a lot of fun.
We should do it again.

11:00.245 --> 11:04.416
And it's just an honor to meet V-dubs
in the human flesh. Cool.

11:07.419 --> 11:09.421
I heard you went up
to the house to see Tilly.

11:09.504 --> 11:13.049
Oh. I get it.
You're here to do cleanup.

11:13.132 --> 11:17.095
She can't help you, Chip.
She feels terrible about the store.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.013
I'm sure it's a real fucking
gut punch, but she...

11:19.097 --> 11:21.891
she can't use
her relationship with Wiener

11:21.974 --> 11:24.227
to influence the development
one way or the other.

11:24.310 --> 11:27.146
- She wants you to know that.
- "Her relationship with Wiener"?

11:27.230 --> 11:29.982
- She told you that she...
- I didn't realize it was with Wiener...

11:31.901 --> 11:34.820
- Oh.
- ...until just now.

11:35.655 --> 11:39.325
So, um... what were you doing
up at the house?

11:42.245 --> 11:45.164
- I want a new deal.
- A new deal?

11:45.248 --> 11:46.832
Isn't that what you do?

11:47.792 --> 11:49.628
I'll talk to Tilly and see
if we can fit something in.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.339
No. This happens today.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.509
Okay.

11:56.593 --> 11:58.970
Wow. I don't remember you
ever being this direct.

11:59.971 --> 12:01.222
Desperate times.

12:11.232 --> 12:13.401
- Hey!
- Hey!

12:13.485 --> 12:15.570
You good? Everything under control?
Know what you're doing?

12:15.654 --> 12:17.614
Yeah, I think so. Thanks.

12:17.697 --> 12:20.617
Everyone's been really helpful,
especially the boys.

12:21.409 --> 12:24.287
- Cool. I'm here if you need anything.
- Cool. Thanks.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.997
Hey...

12:26.080 --> 12:27.748
Sorry.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.709
You and Chip, you dated, right?

12:29.792 --> 12:32.378
No, we didn't date.
We just hung out, really.

12:32.462 --> 12:35.006
Well, made out, mostly.

12:36.257 --> 12:38.801
But did you want more than that, or...?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.345
I knew what I was doing. I'm an adult.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.681
I didn't have to let myself get hurt
if I didn't want to.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.766
Yeah, but if he hurt you,
you don't have to make excuses.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.059
I'm not.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.022
He's a good person.

12:51.105 --> 12:56.528
He's been good to a lot of people.
It's just not fair for me to, you know...

12:56.611 --> 12:58.613
just because
it didn't work out between us.

13:00.532 --> 13:02.116
Hey...

13:02.200 --> 13:05.995
We can't blame other people
for our own unhappiness.

13:06.078 --> 13:07.205
Guess not.

13:20.385 --> 13:24.389
Man, it's like... it's like I have to do
everything around here, man.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.684
Hey, hey! Cooler...
the petitions, man.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.061
Oh, shit. Yeah.

13:33.022 --> 13:33.856
Okay.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.570
Good call, Chip.
I would have forgotten those.

13:42.073 --> 13:44.075
Hey, yeah. Hey, man.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.869
Uh, we'd like to see
the dude in charge, please, ASAP.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.788
We're from Save Venice,

13:48.871 --> 13:51.916
and we're going to destroy this whole
evil empire you've got going on, okay?

13:51.999 --> 13:55.336
- Do you have an appointment?
- No! I don't need an appointment.

13:55.420 --> 13:58.590
- I'm afraid that you do.
- Really?

13:58.673 --> 14:00.425
Just tell Wiener that Chip is here.

14:00.508 --> 14:01.760
Chip?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.843
Yeah.

14:12.604 --> 14:15.147
So, do you know
this Wiener dude, or what?

14:15.231 --> 14:16.232
No.

14:17.442 --> 14:21.070
- He's fucking my ex-wife.
- Oh.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.781
Shit.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.366
I didn't think you guys
were divorced yet.

14:28.453 --> 14:30.496
Fucking your wife.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.207
Yeah. Well, man, so...

14:33.291 --> 14:36.877
he's fucking your wife, and then
he tries to evict you from your spot?

14:36.961 --> 14:40.131
He's, like, got it out for you. Huh?

14:52.811 --> 14:55.271
- [doorbell buzzing]
- All right!

14:55.354 --> 14:57.898
All right, all right! Hang on a minute!

15:01.193 --> 15:03.154
- Oh, hey, London.
- Hey.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.280
Is, um...

15:04.363 --> 15:07.450
- Is Chip here?
- No. No, he's not.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.663
- I don't know where he is.
- Okay, cool. Well, thanks.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.880
Hey, lady? Excuse me.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.634
Hi. Can I use the laboratory please?

15:24.717 --> 15:26.803
Lavatory?

15:26.886 --> 15:29.138
- Down the hall to the left.
- It's over there?

15:29.221 --> 15:31.015
- Leave the box.
- All right.

15:34.185 --> 15:35.436
[woman clears throat]

15:38.439 --> 15:40.024
Chip?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.484
Yeah. Oh.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.779
Hey... you!

15:44.863 --> 15:47.490
- You don't know who I am.
- No, but...

15:47.573 --> 15:49.992
No, I'm saying you don't.
We haven't met.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.578
Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right.

15:54.205 --> 15:55.790
Please, follow me.

16:00.837 --> 16:02.213
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

16:04.382 --> 16:06.008
Ah... [chuckles softly]

16:08.052 --> 16:11.389
So this is the hotel development?

16:17.520 --> 16:20.189
- This is your office?
- Yes.

16:24.569 --> 16:27.530
- You're A. Wiener?
- Alicia.

16:28.907 --> 16:32.451
Wait. So, you and Tilly are les... lovers.

16:32.535 --> 16:35.413
- That surprises you?
- No.

16:35.496 --> 16:36.997
No, it's...

16:39.375 --> 16:42.587
Well, yeah, actually, it does
surprise me a little that my ex-wife...

16:42.670 --> 16:44.129
Still your wife.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.216
Yeah.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.718
...is...

16:50.469 --> 16:52.764
a lover of another woman.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.519
Does Jerry know this?

16:58.603 --> 17:00.354
That his daughter
is the lover of another...

17:00.479 --> 17:01.940
Eh...

17:01.981 --> 17:06.484
No, that his store is a part
of the hotel development.

17:06.569 --> 17:09.280
Jerry doesn't care,
so long as he gets a good price.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.824
Right. So, the store...

17:12.366 --> 17:15.869
[Alicia] Is going to be...

17:15.954 --> 17:17.246
a dog park.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.751
- Do we really need one of those?
- More than we need a stool store.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.377
Trust me, it's an upgrade.

17:23.461 --> 17:27.089
If I were you, I'd be more than a little
worried about the Save Venice campaign.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.467
They're no joke.
They got momentum.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.844
They got, like, ten thousand
signatures on the petition.

17:31.928 --> 17:34.221
They could get a million
and it wouldn't make a difference.

17:34.305 --> 17:35.556
It's just public opinion.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.270
You know this is going to ruin
the lives of a lot of good people, right?

17:41.353 --> 17:43.272
And yours.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.775
Yeah.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.653
You know, I don't get it.
Tilly sticks up for you all the time.

17:48.736 --> 17:50.947
It's like you have this hold on her.

17:51.030 --> 17:54.659
I don't know what it is,
but you cast a very long shadow.

17:54.742 --> 17:58.871
She just refuses to see you for the leech
and the parasite that you are.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.626
Yeah, I'm good here.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.879
- I'll walk you out.
- Don't bother, sweetheart.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.513
You know what I don't get?
Why you people won't take me seriously.

18:15.596 --> 18:18.641
- Why did you come here?
- Tilly needs to talk to me.

18:18.724 --> 18:22.603
I told that to Vanessa Weiss
two hours ago. I'm done waiting.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.448
Bro, did you see
how many hot girls were in there?

18:34.532 --> 18:39.037
They come to the same place
every single day, man. I should get a job.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.998
- Dude, you've still got the petitions.
- Shit.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.377
[ringtone chiming]

18:49.547 --> 18:51.340
Took you long enough.

18:51.423 --> 18:55.177
Yeah, I know.
We're all busy, Vanessa.

18:55.636 --> 18:56.804
Good.

18:57.889 --> 19:00.099
Yeah. No, that doesn't work for me.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.142
No, I tell you what does work...

19:02.226 --> 19:05.354
Yeah, I know.
This place isn't in Venice.

19:05.479 --> 19:09.025
Gelson's parking lot on Maxella.

19:09.108 --> 19:10.568
That's in Marina del Rey!

19:11.652 --> 19:14.154
Well, then tell her not to take Lincoln.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.913
Like shooting fish in a barrel,
dude, it is!

19:34.050 --> 19:36.510
- [knocking on door]
- [barking]

19:36.594 --> 19:38.220
[Dennis] Hey, Cooler!

19:38.303 --> 19:41.223
Come on, guys, chill out. It's open.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.769
Hey. Hey, guys. Hey, man.

19:44.852 --> 19:48.230
Hey, Dennis. What are you doing
in this part of town, dude?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.399
- You mean Mar Vista?
- It's not Mar Vista.

19:50.482 --> 19:53.444
Man, you want to have
the same conversation all over again?

19:53.527 --> 19:56.030
Sorry, man. I just...
I'm looking for Chip.

19:56.114 --> 19:58.866
Went by the store, he wasn't there.
Called his cell, he didn't pick up.

19:58.950 --> 20:02.120
No, he's at the Gelson's, man.
Marina del Rey.

20:02.202 --> 20:06.582
- What? Is he buying groceries?
- No, he went to go meet Vanessa Weiss.

20:06.665 --> 20:10.628
Oh, is she that agent?
She looks after Tilly, right?

20:10.711 --> 20:12.797
Yeah. Yeah, he knows that dude.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.673
Said he'd put a good word in for me,
which is cool.

20:14.757 --> 20:16.008
All right, man.

20:16.092 --> 20:19.219
- Hey, man. Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

20:19.303 --> 20:22.556
You think if I change my name,
it would give my career a shot in the arm?

20:22.640 --> 20:26.102
Well, that depends.
What is your name?

20:27.186 --> 20:30.439
Come on.
How long have you known me?

20:31.899 --> 20:33.233
It's John.

20:34.443 --> 20:36.070
Then, you definitely need a new name.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.074
Fuckin' dick.

21:02.138 --> 21:04.515
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah.

21:07.018 --> 21:07.935
[Chip] Hey!

21:08.019 --> 21:09.895
Over here.

21:09.979 --> 21:11.689
Jesus, Chip. What the hell?

21:12.982 --> 21:14.525
What?

21:14.608 --> 21:17.069
What are we doing
in this stupid parking garage?

21:17.153 --> 21:19.530
- I wanted total privacy.
- [horn honks]

21:19.613 --> 21:20.948
Jesus.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.534
Chip, you're not getting a new deal.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.995
The deal that you had
suited you fine all these years.

21:26.078 --> 21:29.414
Yeah, it suited you fine.
I gave... I let you have a life.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.417
You just don't like the idea of living up
to your end of the bargain.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.379
His sister's here, in Venice.
She came to find me.

21:35.462 --> 21:40.801
- Whose sister?
- The kid. The kid's sist... The fuckin'...

21:40.885 --> 21:43.137
[shopping carts rattling]

21:49.685 --> 21:52.104
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

21:52.188 --> 21:54.773
What does anybody want?
It's always money. There is nothing else.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.234
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I don't know.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.527
So, you're scared,
and you think she knows something,

21:58.610 --> 22:00.404
and you want to extend the deal.

22:00.487 --> 22:04.616
You want me to stop the hotel development
so you can keep the store.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.784
That sounds about right.

22:05.868 --> 22:08.246
Okay. Let's go sit and discuss this
over a nice lunch.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.915
I didn't come here to negotiate
or eat lunch.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.750
Are you fucking threatening me?

22:14.877 --> 22:16.879
Yeah, I guess I am.

22:18.881 --> 22:20.258
Wow.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.812
[soft rock music playing]

23:07.512 --> 23:09.307
[ringtone chiming]

23:09.389 --> 23:12.143
- Hey, man.
- Hey... man. Uh, how you doing?

23:12.226 --> 23:13.852
<i>Uh, yeah, you know.</i>

23:13.936 --> 23:16.355
[Dennis] <i>I heard you went</i>
<i>to see Vanessa Weiss.</i>

23:16.438 --> 23:19.191
Yeah, I thought she could help
with this store shit.

23:19.275 --> 23:20.276
<i>And?</i>

23:21.319 --> 23:22.945
<i>Uh, not looking good.</i>

23:23.028 --> 23:25.156
- So did London track you down?
- <i>No.</i>

23:25.239 --> 23:28.826
- <i>She stopped by to talk to you.</i>
- Oh, that doesn't sound good.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.412
Yeah. You've got to figure this out, man.
You've got to go see her.

23:32.496 --> 23:37.876
- You've got to tackle this thing head on.
- Yeah, you're... right.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.212
Were you there all the time?

23:40.296 --> 23:41.922
No, I just came in.

23:42.006 --> 23:44.842
- Yeah, me too.
- Your...

23:44.925 --> 23:46.969
- [phone ringing]
- [sighs]

23:47.052 --> 23:48.346
It's Kara.

23:49.888 --> 23:53.433
- You're not going to take the call?
- I can't figure this girl out, man.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.977
I think she likes me.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.855
Well, that's not so hard to believe.

23:57.938 --> 24:00.065
I'm seeing her tonight.

24:00.149 --> 24:01.483
- [phone keeps ringing]
- So, take the call.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.194
No.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.446
- [ringing stops]
- In case she's calling to cancel.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.534
So, tackle it head on, yeah?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.786
Yeah. That's always the best policy.

24:12.870 --> 24:14.079
Yeah.

24:14.955 --> 24:17.958
[rock music playing]

24:41.606 --> 24:43.775
[faucet squeaks, water running]

24:51.325 --> 24:52.492
[London] Hey.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.246
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.765
Look like a ghost,
sitting there in the dark.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.143
You must be used
to seeing ghosts by now.

25:18.227 --> 25:22.564
So, is this the part
where you stab me in the heart?

25:22.647 --> 25:24.775
Should I hide all my knives?

25:24.858 --> 25:28.779
If I had wanted to do that, I could have
done it a long time ago and disappeared.

25:30.781 --> 25:34.576
I'm broke.
I don't have anything to give you.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.078
I'm not here for money.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.789
What do you want from me?

25:40.749 --> 25:43.919
I just... I needed to know
what kind of person killed my brother.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.759
The drunk.

25:54.096 --> 25:55.806
It's not me.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.350
I'm not that person.

25:58.434 --> 26:04.189
I... I just needed to make sure
that they were in as much pain as I was...

26:04.273 --> 26:05.941
as...

26:06.024 --> 26:07.025
as I am.

26:08.819 --> 26:14.992
You know, just to make sure
they'd suffered... enough.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.785
How much is enough?

26:17.869 --> 26:19.413
- Chip, I...
- Listen...

26:20.414 --> 26:21.665
[sighs]

26:27.338 --> 26:30.299
Why are you...
why are you still here?

26:31.925 --> 26:34.178
Because I needed to be with you.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.268
I'm not a good person.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.646
You're in pain.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.111
I'm not worth it.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.571
I disagree.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.157
Please. I'm trying to give you the out.
Please just take the out.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.701
I don't want an out.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.122
- I know who you are.
- No, you don't.

27:02.206 --> 27:03.832
Yeah, I do.

27:47.585 --> 27:49.545
Yeah, yeah.
There he is. There he is.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.881
Oh, whoa! Sorry, man.
You were getting it on.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.216
Hey, listen to this, though.

27:54.299 --> 27:58.470
Wiener and Kaufmann pulled out!
There's not gonna be a hotel!

27:59.263 --> 28:01.848
[horns honking and beeping]

28:20.784 --> 28:22.077
You did it, man.

28:24.121 --> 28:25.705
You saved Venice.
