WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:03.253
Andy:
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "NYPD BLUE"...</i>

00:03.420 --> 00:06.006
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO TELL ME ABOUT DISNEY WORLD?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.216
THEO WANTS YOU TO GO, SO...

00:08.216 --> 00:09.134
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

00:09.217 --> 00:12.220
TO DISNEY WORLD? I HAVEN'T
EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

00:12.887 --> 00:16.099
YOU'RE UNDER SUSPENSION.
SHIELD AND GUN.

00:20.979 --> 00:21.980
IF SOMEONE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

00:21.980 --> 00:23.940
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS
WAS A NO-WIN SETUP.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.859
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF AN INTEGRITY TEST?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.028
THIS PLAYED OUT MORE LIKE
A PERSONAL VENDETTA.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.238
YOU FAIL TO REPORT A BRIBE,
AND IT'S MY FAULT?

00:30.238 --> 00:32.198
SMOKER'S COMING UP IN A MONTH.
GREAT...

00:32.198 --> 00:34.284
KINDA HOPING SOMEONE
FROM THE DETECTIVE SQUAD

00:34.284 --> 00:35.744
WOULD FINALLY LACE THEM UP.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.121
ORTIZ HAS BEEN GOING
THROUGH A LOT LATELY,

00:38.121 --> 00:40.582
AND SHE DON'T NEED ANYBODY
BRINGING MORE STATIC

00:40.582 --> 00:41.833
INTO HER LIFE RIGHT NOW.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.752
HOW IS SHE?<i> CALIENTE?</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:45.378
DON'T LIE TO ME.
GIVE IT UP.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.546
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.840
WHEN RODRIGUEZ WAS
IN UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS,

00:48.840 --> 00:50.884
FRAKER WAS IN UNIFORM,
APPARENTLY RIDING SHOTGUN

00:50.884 --> 00:53.261
FOR SOME GUY HE DIDN'T
KNOW WAS A DOPE DEALER.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.929
YOUR BOY RATTED HIM OUT.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.431
SO NOW FRAKER'S AFTER HIM.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.517
THE WAY HE SEES IT, RODRIGUEZ
PUT HIM INTO INTERNAL AFFAIRS,

00:59.517 --> 01:01.019
WHERE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.980
RODRIGUEZ GAVE UP COPS?
YOU'RE SURE.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.732
GOOD ADVICE IS START SWIMMING

01:05.857 --> 01:08.026
SO RODRIGUEZ DOESN'T
PULL YOU DOWN WITH HIM.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.245
SO, WE GOT A NEW
LIEUTENANT COMING IN

01:19.245 --> 01:20.705
UNTIL THIS WHOLE THING
WITH RODRIGUEZ CLEARS?

01:20.705 --> 01:22.123
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN
DO ABOUT THAT.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.750
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING
IN SHAPE FOR THIS FIGHT.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.543
HOW LONG IS THE FIGHT,
3 ROUNDS?

01:25.543 --> 01:26.586
SCHEDULED, YEAH.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.379
BUT THERE'S THIS THING
CALLED A KNOCKOUT,

01:28.379 --> 01:30.673
WHICH TENDS TO END THE FIGHT
A LITTLE SOONER.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.133
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.886
YOU NEED TO SPEED THINGS UP
HERE A LITTLE, SLICK.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.263
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
I'M WARMING UP, MAN.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.974
LAUGHLIN'S BEEN AT IT
A WEEK ALREADY.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.226
I HEARD HE HIRED A GUY

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
USED TO TRAIN HECTOR CAMACHO
BACK IN EAST HARLEM.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.437
HO, HO, HO!

01:45.939 --> 01:48.108
YOU KNOW, NEXT WEEK,
IF YOU'RE NOT READY,

01:48.942 --> 01:50.860
IT WON'T BE TOO LATE
TO GO TO LAUGHLIN AND APOLOGIZE

01:50.860 --> 01:52.112
AND CALL OFF THE FIGHT.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.530
30, 40 YEARS FROM NOW,

01:53.571 --> 01:54.531
NO ONE WILL REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.052
HOW'S IT GOING, BOSS?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.929
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.764
WHEN DO YOU REPORT
TO THE BOROUGH?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.267
TOMORROW. THEY GIVE YOU A DAY
TO GO STIR-CRAZY.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.103
Waitress: MENU?
NO.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.688
SO, WHAT'S UP?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.108
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO HISTORY
BETWEEN YOU AND FRAKER?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.402
I'M SURE.
MAYBE SOMETHING YOU FORGOT?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
WHAT IS IT, ANDY?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.446
MARTENS FROM IAB --

02:35.697 --> 02:37.907
HE SAYS THAT 10 YEARS AGO,
YOU FINGERED SOME COPS

02:37.949 --> 02:39.742
WHO WERE RIDING SHOTGUN
FOR DOPE DEALERS.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.119
FINGERED COPS?
LIKE, RATTED THEM OUT?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.539
FRAKER WAS ONE OF THOSE COPS.
THAT'S WHAT PUT HIM IN IAB.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.124
I NEVER RATTED ON COPS.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.959
DID YOU EVER
INVESTIGATE A COP?

02:48.042 --> 02:50.712
NEVER. NEVER BUDDIED UP
TO A DIRTY COP,

02:50.712 --> 02:52.422
NEVER WORE A WIRE
ON A COP -- NEVER.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.423
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.049
THEN WHERE THE HELL
IS THIS COMING FROM?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
ONCE, DEEP UNDERCOVER,

02:57.260 --> 03:00.221
I GOT AN OVERHEARD THAT COPS
WERE RIDING ON DOPE RUNS

03:00.221 --> 03:02.098
FOR SOME GUYS
THAT I WAS KEEPING AN EYE ON.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.517
THESE DEALERS WERE VERY VIOLENT,
VERY VOLATILE GUYS.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.852
AND IF THINGS WENT SOUR,

03:05.852 --> 03:07.896
THESE COPS COULD'VE BEEN
KILLED -- AND ME, TOO.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.064
SO I REPORTED IT<i> GENERALLY,</i>

03:10.064 --> 03:11.983
ALONG WITH A HUNDRED
OTHER THINGS.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.318
OKAY.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.112
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
REPORTING GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

03:16.112 --> 03:18.281
AND FINGERING SPECIFIC COPS.
I KNOW THAT.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.701
I COULDN'T EXCLUDE WHAT I HEARD.
I COULDN'T JUST SIT ON IT.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.912
SO, FRAKER GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THIS OVERHEARD,

03:23.912 --> 03:25.288
AND TRACED IT BACK TO YOU.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.332
NOW IT'S MY FAULT
HE'S A MISERABLE BRAT.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.125
I GOTTA ROLL.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.337
ANDY...
DON'T GET INTO IT.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.756
IF THIS GETS UGLY,
IT'LL TAKE YOU DOWN, TOO.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.175
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.980
WE GOT AN ATTEMPTED
ARMORED-CAR STICKUP.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.192
GUARDS AND PERPS TRADED SHOTS.
GUARD FOR THE ARMORED CAR'S DOA.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.027
WITNESSES?
JUST THESE GUYS.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.529
THE DRIVER'S DOWN ON THE END,
THE OTHER GUARD'S RIGHT HERE.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.490
THEY WERE AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS WHEN WE RESPONDED.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
WE'LL TAKE THE GUARD.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.164
EXCUSE ME?
ARE YOU THE GUARD?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.959
YEAH. GENE GREAVES.
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:11.292 --> 04:13.211
ME AND MANNY WERE LEAVING
THE HOTEL WITH OUR PICKUP --

04:13.336 --> 04:15.338
MANNY'S THE DOA?
HE'S THE OTHER GUARD.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.924
HE'S WATCHING MY BACK
WHEN THIS BLUE SEDAN PULLS UP.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.510
THREE GUYS GET OUT,
ONE OF THEM HAS GOT A SHOTGUN.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.636
YOU PULL YOUR GUNS?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.221
SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT UP.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.723
ME AND MANNY DROPPED THE BAGS,
PUT OUR HANDS UP.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.685
BUT THAT DICKHEAD -- WHO'S
SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVING<i> ONLY --</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:31.020
HE GETS OUT OF THE CAR,
AND HE STARTS THROWING SHOTS.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.190
MANNY'S BLOOD IS ON HIS HANDS.
YEAH, YOU!

04:34.482 --> 04:35.858
Greg: CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.652
THEY JUST WANTED THE MONEY,

04:37.860 --> 04:40.238
AND THIS ASSHOLE TURNS IT
INTO THE O.K. CORRAL.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.491
SHOTGUN...
RIGHT IN MANNY'S FACE.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.244
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.162
MIKE MENENDEZ.
I REACTED, OKAY?

04:48.162 --> 04:50.081
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
HE'S GOT NO RIGHT --

04:50.081 --> 04:51.499
SLOW DOWN.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.043
THEY WERE GETTING ROBBED.
I GOT OUT TO DEFEND THEM.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.045
HOW MANY PERPS?
THREE.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.630
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK?

04:58.047 --> 04:59.507
THEY HAD ON SKI MASKS...

04:59.549 --> 05:01.009
BUT THEY WERE WHITE GUYS,
I COULD TELL THAT.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.010
YOU HIT ANY OF THEM?

05:02.176 --> 05:03.636
ONE FOR SURE
THAT I KNOW OF.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.888
HIGH, LIKE IN THE FACE
OR IN THE NECK.
HE WAS BLEEDING.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.890
AND I GOT A COUPLE ROUNDS
IN THE CAR.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.517
Andy: SO THE GUARD
OVER THERE,

05:09.517 --> 05:11.185
HIS BEEF WITH YOU IS THAT
YOU GOT THE BULLETS FLYIN'.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.478
I'M AN EX-MARINE.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.814
I SAW ACTION IN DESERT STORM.
I GOT INSTINCTS.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.107
ALL RIGHT,
STICK AROUND.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.820
[ SIGHS ]
THIS ROBBERY WAS AMATEUR HOUR.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.073
YOU GET THE HINT FROM YOUR GUY
THIS WAS AN INSIDE JOB?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.367
YOU KNOW WHOSE
NEIGHBORHOOD THIS IS?

05:26.534 --> 05:28.953
JULIAN'S.
I'LL PAGE HIM.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.538
WE'LL GET A CANVASS GOING.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.666
AND, UH, NO WORD ON, UH,

05:33.708 --> 05:36.002
WHEN THE BOSS
IS GONNA BE COMING BACK?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.755
JUST WORK THE CASE.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.998
Clark: HEY, JOHN.
John: GOOD MORNING, DETECTIVE.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.792
HEY, WE'RE UP.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.877
FEMALE DOA FOUND
IN A GARBAGE TRUCK

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
OVER ON ORCHARD STREET.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.005
THAT RODRIGUEZ'S INTERIM?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.466
YEAH. LIEUTENANT SHANLEY.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.592
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.344
HE JUST WANTS TO BE KEPT UP
ON MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS

07:08.344 --> 07:09.762
IF THE BOROUGH CALLS.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.931
OTHER THAN THAT,
DON'T STEAL ANYTHING.
Andy: GREAT.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.685
COMMUNICATIONS JUST CALLED ON
THAT ARMORED-CAR JOB YOU CAUGHT.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.146
THEY FOUND AN ABANDONED LINCOLN
FIVE BLOCKS FROM THE SCENE.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.190
SHATTERED WINDSHIELD, SKI MASK,
BLOOD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.317
CRIME SCENE'S HEADING DOWN
TO PROCESS IT.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.485
THANKS.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.863
I'LL CANVASS EMERGENCY ROOMS,

07:26.988 --> 07:28.865
SEE IF THEY'VE TREATED
ANYBODY WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.701
I MAY NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE
LOST TIME THIS AFTERNOON.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.869
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

07:32.869 --> 07:35.329
JUST LOOKING INTO SOME THINGS
ON RODRIGUEZ.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.001
YOU GOT A VISITOR
HERE, CLARK.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.419
LOOKS LIKE IT.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.962
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
GETTING LOST.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.505
YOU'RE A REAL TEAM
PLAYER THERE, LAUGHLIN.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.883
TOMMY HACKETT,
WHO ORGANIZES THE SMOKERS?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.510
HE WAS GIVING ME A HARD TIME --
IT'S NOT FOR GRUDGE MATCHES.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.263
SO I TOLD HIM ME AND YOU,
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD FUN, RIGHT?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.431
NOTHING BUT.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.766
I MEAN, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
THE FIGHT -- DON'T GET ME WRONG.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.978
ALL RIGHT, BEAT IT,
LAUGHLIN.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.147
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.607
LET'S GO, JULIAN.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.025
RIGHT.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.948
SIT.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.493
ALL RIGHT, SO WE NEED YOUR HELP
ON THIS ARMORED-CAR THING.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.369
OH, WE NEED,
WE NEED, WE NEED --

08:15.453 --> 08:16.996
IT'S ALWAYS "WE NEED"
WITH YOU GUYS.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.539
MAYBE I HAVE A SITUATION HERE

08:18.539 --> 08:20.958
AND I NEED A LITTLE HELP
FOR ONCE.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.169
"FOR ONCE"?
MAKE IT QUICK.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.505
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THE "GIRLS GONE WILD" VIDEOS?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.756
YEAH.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.175
I'VE...SEEN IT ADVERTISED.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.720
BASICALLY, THIS GUY
FILMED THESE DRUNK CHICKS

08:32.720 --> 08:35.097
FLASHING THEIR FUNBAGS
AT MARDI GRAS,

08:35.097 --> 08:37.350
AND NOW HE'S THIS
MULTIMILLIONAIRE.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.311
SO ME AND MY BUDDY ALDO,
WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER,

08:40.311 --> 08:42.730
AND BOOM!
LIGHT BULB GOES OFF.

08:43.481 --> 08:47.860
WHAT ABOUT MAKING VIDEOS
LIKE THAT FOR THE<i> LADIES?</i>

08:48.319 --> 08:52.198
SO WE GO DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS
TO FILM GUYS FLASHING,

08:52.406 --> 08:55.743
AND WE WERE GONNA CALL IT
"GUYS GONE NUTS."

08:55.993 --> 08:57.662
Andy: "GUYS GONE NUTS"?

08:58.579 --> 08:59.497
YEAH.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.374
AND THESE GUYS
ARE SHOWING THEIR UNITS?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.416
IT'S FOR THE LADIES.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.168
WHAT DO YOU NEED, JULIAN?

09:04.168 --> 09:05.836
WE'RE OUT ON THE STREETS,
NO PERMITS.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.129
COPS CONFISCATED MY GEAR --

09:07.129 --> 09:10.758
5 GRAND IN VIDEO EQUIPMENT,
20 HOURS WORTH OF TAPE.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.177
20 HOURS OF GUYS
WITH THEIR JOHNSONS HANGING OUT?

09:13.177 --> 09:15.054
CAN YOU GET IT
RELEASED FOR ME OR WHAT?

09:15.179 --> 09:16.973
ONE OF THE ARMORED-CAR
COMPANY'S GUARDS

09:17.056 --> 09:18.516
WAS KILLED
IN THE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.727
THEY'RE PUTTING UP
25 GRAND FOR INFO.
WHOO.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.854
THAT SHOULD GET YOU
BACK INTO GAY PORN REAL QUICK.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.815
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.858
I WILL ADDRESS
THAT COMMENT LATER.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.736
BUT ON THIS THING --
YOU TOLD ME ON THE PHONE

09:30.736 --> 09:33.573
THAT THE ROBBERS
USED A SHOTGUN, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.284
WEEK AGO, I'M DOWN AT
DAVEY JONES LIQUOR LOCKER.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.578
MUTUAL FRIEND OF MINE
BRINGS ME OVER THE OWNER --

09:38.578 --> 09:40.037
GUY NAMED VINNIE.

09:40.288 --> 09:44.125
VINNIE ASKS ME IF I CAN
GET HIM A SHOTGUN TO RENT.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.586
I TOLD HIM, YOU KNOW,
I'D SEE WHAT I COULD DO.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.837
DID YOU?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.172
I GOT BACK TO VINNIE
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER,

09:50.256 --> 09:52.049
BUT HE SAID HE HAD ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF EVERYTHING.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.342
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.428
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.725
DON'T LET THIS THING
GET BACK TO ME.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.060
Andy: WAIT TILL
YOU HEAR FROM US.
OKAY.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.698

39:43.464 --> 39:45.341
ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT
THEY'RE WAILING ABOUT

39:45.341 --> 39:47.176
COULD SEND YOU
TO PRISON FOR 20 YEARS.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.096
IF THAT'S THE STORY,
JOSE, LAY IT OUT.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.640
WELL, LET ME GO
WITH JUAN'S SIDE OF IT.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.225
YOU'RE A PSYCHO

39:54.225 --> 39:56.143
WHO TURNED A NAIVE GIRL
INTO A BANK ROBBER,

39:56.143 --> 39:59.021
THEN KILLED HER<i> AND </i>HER FRIEND
WHEN THEY TRIED TO BACK OUT.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.356
THAT'LL PLAY, TOO.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.942
A TRIGGER-HAPPY LUNATIC.
LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT?

40:02.942 --> 40:04.151
[ SIGHS ]

40:04.151 --> 40:07.196
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'LL GO DOWN, THEN.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.406
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME!

40:08.406 --> 40:09.824
IT'S A MIRACLE.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.075
I WANT A LAWYER!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.535
CAN'T FACE UP
TO WHAT YOU DID?

40:12.535 --> 40:14.245
LAWYER.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.622
<i>MARICóN.</i>

40:16.622 --> 40:18.499
LAWYER NOW.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.838
WE'LL GET YOU A LAWYER
WHEN WE GET TO IT.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.763
TWO GRAND AS PROMISED.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.224
A CHECK FROM THE
ARMORED-CAR COMPANY --

40:35.224 --> 40:36.892
THAT'LL BE HERE
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

40:36.892 --> 40:40.104
AND THAT DOCTOR
THAT I GAVE YOU,
YOU DON'T APPROACH HIM.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.482
THE CASE IS WRAPPED, JULIAN.
WE'RE DONE. COME ON.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.612
WHAT?

40:48.612 --> 40:51.073
YOU LIE RIGHT TO MY FACE.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.241
ABOUT WHAT?

40:52.241 --> 40:54.535
THAT DOCTOR CALLED ME
SCREAMING AT ME

40:54.535 --> 40:56.036
FOR GETTING HIM INVOLVED.

40:56.036 --> 40:57.580
YOU LIE RIGHT TO MY FACE!

40:57.580 --> 40:59.790
WE SAID VINNIE.
YOUR NAME WAS NEVER MENTIONED.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.376
VINNIE AND THE DOCTOR HAVE
A CONVERSATION ONE DAY,

41:02.376 --> 41:03.794
AND THEY SHARE STORIES...

41:03.794 --> 41:06.630
WHEN THE DOCTOR VISITS VINNIE
IN JAIL? DON'T WORRY.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.424
I WORRY
ABOUT GETTING WHACKED.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.926
THAT'S SOMETHING
I WORRY ABOUT.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.511
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

41:18.392 --> 41:21.437
I'LL BE BACK TO GET
MY CHECK.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.063
AFTER THAT, LOSE MY NUMBER.

41:28.527 --> 41:31.614
1, 2, 3, 4.
NICE. 1, 2, 3, 4.

41:32.698 --> 41:33.908
THERE YOU GO, JOHN!

41:33.908 --> 41:36.118
QUICKER!
1, 2 ON THE RIGHT.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.578
1, 2 ON THE RIGHT.
QUICKER.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.246
QUICKER!

41:41.332 --> 41:42.500
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.628
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.463
Rita: HEY!

41:48.672 --> 41:50.341
I FIGURED YOU GUYS
MIGHT GET HUNGRY.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.843
THAT'S NOT PART
OF THE DIET PLAN, RITA.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.137
YOU CAN LEAVE IT.
IT'LL GET EATEN.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.680
LET HIM HAVE A SLICE.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.141
MAYBE LATER.
IF HE EARNS IT.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.643
I THOUGHT THESE GUYS
WERE YOUR FRIENDS.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.228
I WAS FOOLED.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.438
YOU TREAT HIM RIGHT
OR DEAL WITH ME.

42:04.438 --> 42:06.732
HE'LL LIVE.
DON'T WORRY.

42:06.732 --> 42:07.983
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

42:07.983 --> 42:10.110
THANKS FOR BRINGING THAT BY.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.071
NO PROBLEM.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.574
THAT WAS NICE OF HER.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.909
YEAH.

42:18.410 --> 42:20.287
COME ON.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.748
ALL RIGHT!

42:22.748 --> 42:24.041
1, 2, 3.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.710
1, 2, 3, 4
ON THE RIGHT.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.295
COME ON. 1, 2, 3.

42:28.295 --> 42:30.005
1, 2 ON THE RIGHT.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.507
THERE YOU GO.

42:45.229 --> 42:48.315
SO I HAVE COFFEE WITH YOU
IN THE MORNING,

42:48.315 --> 42:51.318
BY THE AFTERNOON,
I'M BACK AT MY DESK.

42:51.318 --> 42:52.778
SOME COINCIDENCE.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.238
GUESS SO.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.992
DID YOU GET ME
OUT OF THIS JACKPOT?

42:57.992 --> 43:01.078
IT'S NOT A JACKPOT UNLESS YOU
DO SOMETHING WRONG.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.122
I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
DOING PEOPLE FAVORS,

43:03.122 --> 43:05.874
BUT PEOPLE DOING THEM FOR ME,
I DON'T ASK FOR THAT.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.751
YOU DIDN'T.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.670
THIS MORNING WAS JUST
TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY?

43:09.670 --> 43:11.714
YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY CALLS
OR GO SEE ANYONE?

43:11.714 --> 43:14.008
YOU'RE BACK WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.843
DON'T GO POKING IT
WITH A STICK.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.763
I APPRECIATE IT.

43:19.763 --> 43:21.348
TRULY.
