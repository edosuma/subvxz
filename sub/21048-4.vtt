WEBVTT

00:09.460 --> 00:12.544
I think your father was murdered.
It's a Clios matter.

00:13.069 --> 00:16.184
There's something in there that Constantine
didn't want me to see. I know it.

00:16.215 --> 00:18.558
I need to know if I made
the worst mistake of my life.

00:21.593 --> 00:25.599
Your husband had the copy made
for some oligarch to put on his yacht.

00:26.014 --> 00:28.409
I see it in you now. That look.

00:28.439 --> 00:31.243
What look?
Revenge.

00:38.710 --> 00:41.110
Um, yes?
Dunno, why not.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.967
I tried to pin you down
for quite some time.

00:42.997 --> 00:46.631
I'm flattered.
Well, um, every time I see you,

00:46.661 --> 00:48.635
you're bidding on
some art work that I want.

00:48.958 --> 00:51.426
Except that I never get to beat you!

00:51.456 --> 00:54.675
That does not stop you from trying.
I gamble on other people's ignorance.

00:55.285 --> 00:58.535
That does not stop you from trying.

00:58.828 --> 01:03.499
Sometimes you get lucky.
Mm, so, this is your passion?

01:03.529 --> 01:06.744
Is that a surprise?
No! It's just that, you know...

01:06.774 --> 01:09.925
art in the Riviera
is a financial investment.

01:10.628 --> 01:12.974
It's men finding more
ways to make more money.

01:13.255 --> 01:16.851
Oh, but you're different, right?
Not as different as you.

01:18.961 --> 01:20.896
He won't see me? Why not?
What's your ambition?

01:21.561 --> 01:22.948
I want to own my own collection.

01:23.335 --> 01:26.384
I mean, you weren't born into it,
you didn't inherit it, it's just you!

01:27.028 --> 01:32.090
It's an obstacle.
No, you are young and very good

01:32.120 --> 01:34.869
and your competitors
are old and rich.

01:34.899 --> 01:37.176
You are their worst nightmare.

01:48.470 --> 01:49.526
You crazy bastard!

03:38.879 --> 03:41.947
<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

03:46.350 --> 03:49.711
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

03:49.741 --> 03:53.425
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

03:53.840 --> 03:57.143
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

03:57.514 --> 04:00.954
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

04:00.984 --> 04:07.193
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

04:08.538 --> 04:11.880
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knee</i>

04:11.910 --> 04:15.320
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

04:15.350 --> 04:22.762
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

04:23.426 --> 04:27.081
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

04:27.111 --> 04:30.536
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

04:30.566 --> 04:38.101
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

04:38.394 --> 04:42.420
Look, it's how they do things around here.
Breaking and entering, Riviera style.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.847
Using a sedative gas

04:43.877 --> 04:46.270
is much more effective than
hitting people over the head

04:46.300 --> 04:49.197
What were you thinking? I mean,
that could have gone wrong.

04:49.227 --> 04:51.797
Badly wrong!
But it didn't, did it?

04:52.031 --> 04:53.263
And you got what you wanted.

04:55.144 --> 04:57.528
So, you had a look around...
Yeah!

04:57.880 --> 05:00.479
I might have had a peek.
Nice drug stash!

05:00.772 --> 05:02.766
Do you think Constantine knew?
No.

05:03.118 --> 05:04.368
No, there's no way,

05:05.391 --> 05:08.224
though that does explain how
Christos has been acting lately.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.840
I also found something
he may not have seen.

05:15.864 --> 05:19.225
What's all this?
My entire life.

05:24.214 --> 05:27.263
You've been here all night?
Here, take this.

05:27.751 --> 05:29.549
You look like you need it.
Thanks.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.618
So, how's it going?
Fine.

05:33.778 --> 05:36.847
What is it about these kids that
has got you so hot under the collar?

05:39.016 --> 05:40.149
Come with me.

05:47.016 --> 05:48.951
This is Bela. Have you met?

05:49.771 --> 05:52.996
Bela earns 12,000 Euros a year. 12,000.

05:53.026 --> 05:56.334
And somehow, he supports
3 children and 7 grandchildren

05:56.364 --> 05:59.246
He buys food, toys, pays his mortgage.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.767
He even manages to take his wife
out for a meal once a month.

06:02.545 --> 06:03.972
And all the while, Bela pays

06:04.002 --> 06:08.389
a percentage of everything he earns,
2,000 Euros, to the State, to the Nation

06:08.593 --> 06:11.876
But the Clios' of this world; they
get away with paying almost nothing.

06:13.094 --> 06:15.048
And every penny in tax,
they don't pay...

06:15.243 --> 06:19.680
is taken away from Bela's hospitals,
his schools, his Police service.

06:20.603 --> 06:23.906
Look at him. Here he is, toiling
away in the bowels of society,

06:24.215 --> 06:26.482
while paying his fair share.
Where are they?

06:26.892 --> 06:31.348
Well, most of Constantine Clios is
in pieces at the bottom of the sea.

06:31.704 --> 06:35.086
But I take your point.
His wife, his entire family...

06:35.633 --> 06:37.919
are still living on the
proceeds of his corruption.

06:39.468 --> 06:42.048
I thought you're only after the Bank.
I'm after all of them.

06:43.025 --> 06:46.719
Everyone who steals money
from me, from Bela, even from you.

06:50.117 --> 06:52.404
Georgina Ryland, Class of '97

06:52.434 --> 06:54.124
I've never even seen
my Birth Certificate.

06:54.397 --> 06:57.876
Fingerprints, our Marriage License,
medical records

06:57.906 --> 06:59.518
my Mother's Death Certificate?

06:59.548 --> 07:00.657
Why do you think he did this?

07:00.930 --> 07:02.943
He never asked me for any of it.

07:04.194 --> 07:05.699
Your middle name is Marjorie?

07:06.070 --> 07:07.868
I have my grandmother
to thank for that.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.790
There's also this: bank statements.

07:13.923 --> 07:15.741
I never knew about those bank accounts.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.865
There must be thousands
of transactions here.

07:20.225 --> 07:26.850
All for tiny amounts from the Cayman
Islands, Lichtenstein, the Bahamas...

07:31.143 --> 07:33.997
There's a pattern here... Look,

07:36.440 --> 07:41.248
the payments build up over months
until the total reaches several million

07:41.278 --> 07:44.297
and then, the entire amount
is transferred out of the bank.

07:44.512 --> 07:46.760
See, balance drops to zero.

07:46.790 --> 07:50.942
A few months later, an even larger
amount is transferred back in

07:50.972 --> 07:55.433
And these transactions go to and from...
John Brandeis?

07:56.254 --> 07:58.091
I do know what that money was for.

08:00.568 --> 08:04.379
There, the Picasso?
I bought that.

08:05.454 --> 08:11.063
27 million dollars, a record sale.
The seller, John Brandeis.

08:12.508 --> 08:15.010
The Reuben?
We sold that to John Brandeis.

08:15.498 --> 08:17.179
The Gaugin, the Sheila?

08:17.707 --> 08:24.152
All bought or sold, at Constantine's
request, to or from John Brandeis.

08:26.472 --> 08:31.299
Jukes was right. They were
laundering money on a massive scale

08:32.687 --> 08:33.741
and i was helping them.

08:35.885 --> 08:41.083
He used me, Robert.
He never loved me,

08:41.690 --> 08:45.188
I was just useful to him.

08:46.978 --> 08:52.138
My marriage was a sham.
A fucking sham!

09:23.208 --> 09:26.823
I'm back so soon, I thought
you might be taking stock.

09:27.253 --> 09:28.660
I want my car back.

09:29.897 --> 09:34.646
I should ban you for your own good.
Like you're going to do that!

09:35.682 --> 09:39.415
Now you think throwing your car keys
on the table makes you a big shot?

09:41.912 --> 09:44.668
Nobody wants some
miserable car junkie

09:44.698 --> 09:48.675
crying on their shoulder and
I'm not sure I want one for a partner.

09:48.705 --> 09:51.055
Listen, just because we're
taking your dirty money,

09:51.085 --> 09:54.084
doesn't make us partners.
As you wish.

09:55.374 --> 09:57.055
But you know what they say:

09:57.085 --> 09:59.340
Never gamble more than
you can afford to lose.

10:00.493 --> 10:02.194
But that's no fun, right?
We don't gamble to win money,

10:06.889 --> 10:10.328
it's the risk of losing everything,
that's the thrill.

10:10.836 --> 10:12.126
Spare me the bad talk.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.937
How about an IOU?

10:16.722 --> 10:19.263
The debt is 600,000

10:20.201 --> 10:24.285
No one ever walked out
of this casino with an IOU.

10:24.993 --> 10:28.805
No One. So, why should
I take one from you?

10:33.421 --> 10:37.448
Your mother paid your debt for you.

10:39.250 --> 10:42.123
You can pick up your
car keys at the office.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.029
I hear your mother
runs your bank now.

11:31.318 --> 11:34.171
Hello.
I've come to take you to lunch.

11:35.422 --> 11:38.021
Irina, you should have called.

11:40.171 --> 11:41.950
It's a surprise.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.751
We can't, not here.

11:46.002 --> 11:50.028
Your face is red.
We can't! It's us.

11:50.697 --> 11:53.160
We need to cool things down.
I'm sorry.

11:53.531 --> 11:55.329
Why?
Why?

11:55.974 --> 11:58.554
You're the ex-wife of a
possibly murdered billionaire

11:58.584 --> 12:01.510
having an affair with the chief
investigator, what do you think!

12:01.901 --> 12:05.086
Not to mention, this whole
financial scandal with Jukes!

12:05.380 --> 12:08.820
What about the girls? They're friends.
I talked to Sophie

12:12.182 --> 12:13.335
So, this is it.

12:18.075 --> 12:21.261
This is what you want.
What I want

12:21.652 --> 12:25.346
is not to lose my job
over a scandal I can avoid.

12:28.209 --> 12:33.584
You're a small man, Jean,
in all the ways that matter.

12:47.545 --> 12:49.909
Your Mom's kinda hot.
If you say so,

12:49.939 --> 12:52.059
I mean it's not open for discussion.
She's stunning.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.229
I can see what my Dad sees in her.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.163
Well, if you like her
so much, go fuck her.

12:56.539 --> 12:58.044
She slept with a girl once.
Really?

12:58.074 --> 13:00.526
Yeah, she told me she fucked some
actress when she was younger.

13:00.556 --> 13:02.598
She told you that?
She tells me everything.

13:02.628 --> 13:03.966
Oh, my mother barely speaks to me.

13:04.572 --> 13:06.174
Lucky you.
Yeah, I guess.

13:06.784 --> 13:09.442
So, are you going to do it?
Do what?

13:09.472 --> 13:11.552
Get with my mum.
No!

13:12.666 --> 13:13.995
What do you think of Dominic?

13:18.348 --> 13:19.541
He's kind of hot.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.470
I'm grooming him.
Oh!

13:22.500 --> 13:25.734
Can you groom someone who's older?
Sure, why not!

13:34.382 --> 13:36.219
Do you remember that
number you wrote on me?

13:36.962 --> 13:39.346
15-07-201-4?

13:39.717 --> 13:41.691
That was the day that
Constantine and I met.

13:41.906 --> 13:43.861
Nobody would ever know that but us.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.455
I saw it and for a second, I thought...

13:48.253 --> 13:49.758
maybe he is still alive,

13:50.618 --> 13:52.435
maybe it's some sort of message to me.

13:52.850 --> 13:55.919
and I remembered
the man who loved me.

13:57.580 --> 14:00.453
What sort of sick fuck
uses his wife like that?

14:00.868 --> 14:03.604
It doesn't look good but

14:05.094 --> 14:06.560
let's think about it for a moment.

14:08.964 --> 14:12.579
None of those transactions
actually implicate you.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.555
They implicate Constantine
and john Brandeis.

14:15.809 --> 14:18.662
Maybe, he had to go into hiding...

14:19.131 --> 14:21.828
to protect himself
and protect you.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.343
but he left evidence
that you weren't complicit

14:24.373 --> 14:26.590
in a place that he knew
only you would find.

14:27.802 --> 14:29.756
Georgie, maybe...
He's dead!

14:30.968 --> 14:32.961
Maybe, he deserves to be...

14:33.714 --> 14:36.607
murdered by the same drug dealers
and war criminals that he was helping.

14:37.506 --> 14:40.300
But how do I know?
How can I ever know?

14:40.887 --> 14:42.196
Well, there's one man you could ask:

14:44.276 --> 14:45.135
John Brandeis.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.867
Irina!
This is a surprise.

15:08.864 --> 15:09.822
I'm here to see Ada.

15:11.463 --> 15:12.499
Do I need an appointment?

15:13.051 --> 15:15.338
Of course not!
Where is she?

15:15.592 --> 15:18.347
Playing with the gardener
and that awful girl who's

15:18.377 --> 15:20.282
always following her around.
Are you staying long?

15:22.726 --> 15:25.169
Would you like a drink? A juice?

15:25.677 --> 15:29.391
What is this, Saudi Arabia?
I'll have a martini.

15:35.079 --> 15:37.717
I know you don't give a shit about
girls like us but I'm telling you the truth.

15:37.747 --> 15:41.098
Ok, if you can just take a seat and...
I already told you, I cannot wait.

15:41.128 --> 15:44.049
If they see I've gone, I'm dead.
When the Duty Officer arrives...

15:44.079 --> 15:47.237
Just remember, Ameera Sayed.
Ameera Sayed!

16:15.272 --> 16:18.634
This is actually a very good martini.
Were you once a barmaid?

16:19.889 --> 16:20.632
Thanks.

16:21.551 --> 16:24.052
Yeah, I used to make cocktails
at a bar in New York.

16:24.899 --> 16:25.877
It was good money.

16:27.596 --> 16:29.922
It's always good to have
something to fall back on.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.968
You must be stressed
with the police investigation?

16:35.755 --> 16:39.644
I've got nothing to hide but
none of us are on firm ground.

16:40.563 --> 16:43.651
Your marriage,
through this Jukes microscope

16:43.681 --> 16:47.497
will seem very convenient.
There is no convenience.

16:47.927 --> 16:51.113
Of course. Love's dream.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.495
So, no skeletons in your closet?
No.

16:58.212 --> 17:00.127
It must be nice to be
the innocent one.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.123
I understand that
it must be difficult for you

17:03.153 --> 17:05.330
to have another woman
living in your home

17:05.663 --> 17:06.836
with your children

17:08.106 --> 17:10.744
but there's only so many insults
I can take before lunch.

17:11.146 --> 17:13.823
Georgina, I'm sorry.

17:15.719 --> 17:17.262
I've come to ask you a favor.

17:41.466 --> 17:44.574
Why even bother hosting a gala?
Tradition.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.388
They always used to have it here.

17:49.249 --> 17:51.497
Constantine and I
would host it together.

17:52.064 --> 17:53.999
The children would be
allowed to stay for an hour

17:54.029 --> 17:55.464
and then, they'd be
taken up to bed.

17:55.953 --> 17:58.064
You's always see them,
like little birds...

17:59.188 --> 18:02.197
perched in line, at the
top of the stairs, peering down.

18:05.129 --> 18:08.334
Adam used to send down
Christos to steal canapes.

18:09.478 --> 18:10.943
Who are you thinking of inviting?

18:14.383 --> 18:17.217
Bored people and guilty people.

18:17.745 --> 18:19.562
Then why do you host them?

18:21.928 --> 18:24.586
Because I'm both guilty and bored.

18:26.267 --> 18:29.394
I can think of a few names
I'd like to add to the guest list.

18:29.853 --> 18:33.312
Anyone in particular?
A business associate of Constantine's,

18:33.976 --> 18:35.931
John Brandeis. Do you know him?

18:37.963 --> 18:41.978
No, actually but the more, the merrier.
Of course.

18:49.034 --> 18:49.952
Who is it?

18:51.014 --> 18:52.871
I am here to see Grigory Litvinov.

18:53.946 --> 18:57.073
He is not here.
Tell him his life is in danger.

19:15.229 --> 19:16.597
Give us 5 minutes.

19:21.332 --> 19:22.133
drink?

19:23.540 --> 19:24.009
No.

19:25.470 --> 19:26.271
Suit yourself.

19:32.980 --> 19:35.911
So, who wants to kill me?

19:38.145 --> 19:39.982
The girl that survived the explosion.

19:41.604 --> 19:42.386
Do you know her?

19:44.458 --> 19:48.404
Look around you. There are so
many girls that come and go.

19:52.254 --> 19:53.680
Did you know that this girl

19:54.052 --> 19:57.589
attacked a nurse and killed
a man who gave her a ride?

19:58.200 --> 19:58.689
Nope.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.992
She's either very scared of someone

20:03.653 --> 20:05.451
or she's fucking ruthless.

20:06.589 --> 20:09.228
If she's involved in the explosion,
then who's to say

20:09.697 --> 20:12.003
you are not on the
same list as your father.

20:12.374 --> 20:15.345
This all sounds like a
grand fuckup on your part

20:16.116 --> 20:18.285
for not arresting her
when you had the chance.

20:24.227 --> 20:26.299
I am not going to
make any more mistakes.

20:40.888 --> 20:41.787
Hey!

20:42.334 --> 20:43.136
Oh...

20:43.507 --> 20:44.875
They're not both for me.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.201
I'm entertaining, she's outside.

20:49.134 --> 20:52.593
Look, you're welcome to join us
if you're at a loose end.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.075
You don't have to pity me, Adam.

20:55.935 --> 20:58.593
I didn't think I was.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.022
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.986
It's just that I've been feeling
more and more like a widow

21:06.016 --> 21:08.038
these days and not much else.

21:09.069 --> 21:09.851
I don't like it.

21:17.849 --> 21:20.488
You know, you learn so much more
about people after they're dead

21:20.957 --> 21:22.208
than when they were alive.

21:25.882 --> 21:27.758
I'll let you get back to...

21:29.169 --> 21:30.087
Natasha.

21:31.279 --> 21:33.898
Well, um, you're welcome
to join us. I mean it.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.397
It does no good sitting here
on your own, dwelling on things.

21:38.065 --> 21:38.944
Trust me.

21:40.293 --> 21:45.413
Sun, gin, swim...
that's a remedy!

21:47.138 --> 21:50.910
Thank you, no.
Maybe in a second?

21:52.200 --> 21:52.787
Alright.

21:59.366 --> 22:01.574
I could never pity you, Georgina.

22:33.737 --> 22:34.636
She's new.

22:36.903 --> 22:38.135
What happened to the last one?

22:39.247 --> 22:40.204
Who could remember?

23:36.483 --> 23:39.219
Hello! Yes, I'm calling from
the Clios Art Foundation.

23:39.249 --> 23:41.877
We have a vault with you.
Yes, thank you.

23:42.298 --> 23:45.835
Well, in light of his recent passing,
I'm going to need to come down

23:45.865 --> 23:47.008
and review the collection

23:48.317 --> 23:50.296
Ok, so what do
I need to bring again?

23:50.326 --> 23:53.892
I'll bring some ID,
a copy of my passport,

23:54.537 --> 23:58.387
marriage license, our
certificate of incorporation.

23:58.417 --> 24:01.214
Yes, yes, I've got all that. Great!

24:02.523 --> 24:04.634
How does first thing
tomorrow morning sound?

24:06.139 --> 24:08.054
Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

25:05.227 --> 25:06.537
English?
Mm Hmm.

25:07.905 --> 25:10.172
What's your name?
Cheri.

25:11.394 --> 25:12.606
Do you want to party?

25:15.929 --> 25:16.398
Yeah.

25:26.338 --> 25:28.625
Please stop.
I don't want to do anything,

25:28.918 --> 25:29.915
I'm just here to talk.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.240
You want me to talk dirty?
No.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.144
I'm a policeman.

25:35.766 --> 25:37.467
I saw you at the
Police Station this morning.

25:38.756 --> 25:40.769
The girl you're looking for,
is she still missing?

25:41.199 --> 25:42.040
Yes, my sister.

25:46.974 --> 25:48.206
Do you recognize her?

25:50.732 --> 25:51.905
No, I'm sorry.

25:52.334 --> 25:53.663
She may be in danger, too.

25:54.015 --> 25:56.712
If you help me find my sister,
I can ask the girls.

25:56.742 --> 25:58.080
Maybe one of them knows her.

26:00.430 --> 26:02.834
Wouldn't that get you in trouble?
It might.

26:03.850 --> 26:04.710
My sister...

26:05.942 --> 26:08.385
she was sent to a private party
last weekend and never came back.

26:08.824 --> 26:11.267
Ok, I'll see what I can find out.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.531
Where was the party?
I don't know.

26:14.922 --> 26:17.287
Do you have a picture of her?
You don't need one.

26:17.498 --> 26:20.175
Just take a good look at me.
She's my twin.

26:56.784 --> 26:58.587
Hello?
It's me.

27:08.875 --> 27:14.660
Why don't you put that thing down.
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

27:14.973 --> 27:16.380
You were meant to give me more time.

27:16.790 --> 27:18.691
These things happen.
Not to me.

27:21.700 --> 27:25.297
Why are you acting so rattled?
It makes you look weak.

27:26.104 --> 27:26.925
Put it down.

27:32.143 --> 27:35.231
What were you thinking?
You forget who you're working for!

27:35.485 --> 27:37.166
Wait!
I have no choice.

27:37.196 --> 27:39.457
Elena is still out there.
I know where.

27:55.386 --> 27:56.695
I heard them talkin'

27:57.502 --> 28:00.043
Who?
On the yacht, the father,

28:00.073 --> 28:01.470
he had the sense to split it.

28:02.134 --> 28:04.949
Only half of it was destroyed.
And where's the other half?

28:05.672 --> 28:06.942
I think it's in the house.

28:09.166 --> 28:12.137
I'm the one who fucked it.
I will put it back together.

28:13.583 --> 28:17.316
Make sure that you do.
Elena's worth more than you.

28:18.298 --> 28:18.943
Alright.

28:24.943 --> 28:27.113
What the fuck is that?
Insurance.

28:28.914 --> 28:31.982
Just a little tracker, you know...

28:32.803 --> 28:35.304
it would be terrible if me and
you were to lose each other.

29:11.139 --> 29:14.051
It's like Fort Knox in here.
But it's far more secure.

29:14.638 --> 29:15.478
Mrs. Clios...

29:17.745 --> 29:19.856
I will check you in,
if the computer permits it.

29:25.270 --> 29:26.795
And it finally does.

29:27.264 --> 29:30.220
Welcome.
Monsieur Schneider, this is...

29:30.670 --> 29:33.679
Executive Assistant, actually.

29:34.559 --> 29:35.497
This way, please.

29:38.927 --> 29:40.891
Art work that
doesn't leave the free port

29:40.921 --> 29:43.451
is exempt from all
tax and Customs duties.

29:43.668 --> 29:45.890
Art sales conducted
within these walls

29:45.920 --> 29:47.629
can also be considered tax-free

29:48.118 --> 29:50.854
Due to this, we hold many of the
most expensive paintings in the world.

29:51.588 --> 29:52.976
You probably witnessed their sales at

29:53.006 --> 29:55.282
New York and London's
most prestigious auction houses.

29:55.477 --> 29:57.842
I have probably bid on them.
Yet, here...

29:58.590 --> 30:02.577
The sale merely involves the movement
of canvas from one boat to the next.

30:02.929 --> 30:04.531
It is almost comical.

30:04.561 --> 30:07.263
If not a little bit tragic.
That may be too.

30:07.293 --> 30:09.843
Like most things, it
depends on one's perspective.

30:12.975 --> 30:14.558
This is the Clios vault now.

30:16.297 --> 30:18.545
I'll leave you here, so
you can view in privacy.

30:19.131 --> 30:22.727
Discretion is our modus operandi.
Come back to Reception when your done.

30:22.757 --> 30:23.511
Thank you.

30:48.264 --> 30:49.906
There's not much in here.

31:10.321 --> 31:14.797
Georgie, this looks like the real deal.
But these don't belong to me.

31:15.981 --> 31:18.033
They belong to John Brandeis.

31:18.229 --> 31:19.870
I should know, I sold
them to him

31:19.900 --> 31:22.782
Well, what are they doing locked in
a vault belonging to Constantine?

31:24.507 --> 31:25.289
What's this?

31:51.239 --> 31:55.636
The details of a bank account.
John Brandeis.

32:00.820 --> 32:05.217
His passport. There's no address.
Look, a lottery ticket.

32:06.544 --> 32:10.648
Piazza Grande, from a
lottery booth across the border.

32:33.876 --> 32:35.928
Christos Clios, what
are you doing here?

32:35.958 --> 32:37.198
I heard you were in town.

32:37.228 --> 32:38.820
The rumor has it,
you hate Monaco.

32:39.148 --> 32:42.295
A rumor is a circulated story
of questionable truth.

32:42.325 --> 32:44.855
My disdain for Monaco is fact.

32:44.885 --> 32:47.782
I do my utmost to remind
people of it at every juncture.

32:48.935 --> 32:52.199
Could we talk in private?
Of course! Excuse me.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.336
I'm so sorry, your father...
my most sincere condolences.

32:59.366 --> 33:01.446
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.

33:01.476 --> 33:04.339
Do they know what happened?
No, not yet.

33:05.219 --> 33:06.000
It's been difficult.

33:06.665 --> 33:09.479
Lawyers, litigation, freeing
up my father's estate...

33:11.492 --> 33:14.678
That's why I'm here.
In light of what's happened,

33:16.332 --> 33:22.159
The Clios collection is coveted.
Yes, it is. And expensive!

33:22.825 --> 33:25.801
And even for these vulgarians,
400 million is not a steal

33:26.619 --> 33:28.613
Let's not be too stuck on
the collection as a whole.

33:29.227 --> 33:31.631
Will Georgina not be upset?
No.

33:32.530 --> 33:36.380
No, she and I would accept offers
on single items, be reasonable.

33:37.123 --> 33:37.729
Reasonable?

33:39.537 --> 33:40.475
Make some sales.

33:42.078 --> 33:46.085
We need to sell some paintings
and let's keep this between us.

33:46.397 --> 33:48.958
I don't want to create too
much noise and start a frenzy.

34:03.268 --> 34:05.848
This is the girl we
found by the train station.

34:26.407 --> 34:27.638
What is it you found there?

34:27.931 --> 34:29.553
Put this on.
Why?

34:29.583 --> 34:31.956
We're leaving. We have
to get you out of here.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.260
You found her, didn't you?

34:33.290 --> 34:34.893
We have to get you out of here first,

34:34.924 --> 34:36.942
then we can discuss this
somewhere safe.

34:38.302 --> 34:39.123
Oh, my God!

34:40.217 --> 34:42.270
No, you need to tell me.

34:42.954 --> 34:46.764
They found her
next to the train station.

34:47.978 --> 34:50.831
She had overdosed. I'm sorry.

34:51.476 --> 34:52.943
But she didn't even use.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.855
She didn't take anything,
even when they said it would help.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.805
She was the strong one.
Please!

34:58.098 --> 35:00.913
We have to get you out of here
before they do the same thing to you.

35:01.812 --> 35:04.255
Let them. Negrescu's evil.

35:08.140 --> 35:12.889
Listen, if you want me to catch
the man who did this to your sister,

35:13.534 --> 35:15.078
you must come with me now.

36:15.188 --> 36:15.813
Hello.

36:17.045 --> 36:17.885
I'm fine.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.454
Now? What makes you
think I have the time?

36:24.389 --> 36:25.640
I don't like surprises.

36:35.689 --> 36:39.128
Let's do this to all threatening
to pull out of the Clios Bank.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.241
Luckily for us,
he's got a wife and kids and

36:45.271 --> 36:47.723
my guess is, he
wants to keep it that way.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.675
So...
When do we shine the beaches?

36:53.176 --> 36:53.704
Go.

36:59.914 --> 37:02.299
Now. look there. There.

37:14.051 --> 37:16.064
Now, this is my favorite bit.

37:29.056 --> 37:30.288
So, do I get a kiss?

37:31.817 --> 37:34.650
Maybe. We're having a gala at the villa

37:34.680 --> 37:36.800
for the Foundation.
I'd like for you to be there.

37:38.340 --> 37:38.887
Alright.

37:40.802 --> 37:44.320
When do we pay him a visit?
He's got my number.

37:46.377 --> 37:49.465
Oh! And he's very efficient.

37:53.550 --> 37:54.371
Hello?

37:58.446 --> 37:59.209
Who am I?

38:00.655 --> 38:02.394
Just a helpful friend.

38:14.197 --> 38:17.421
They have frozen my personal account
as well as the business account.

38:17.451 --> 38:18.985
How the fuck
am I supposed to live?

38:19.015 --> 38:21.815
Well, I can lend you a card.
I don't want mommy's credit card!

38:21.845 --> 38:23.242
I want my fucking life back!

38:23.272 --> 38:25.274
I think, with the way
you're acting at the moment,

38:25.304 --> 38:28.284
not having access to money
might not be such a bad idea.

38:28.314 --> 38:30.688
You come here to lecture me, just...

38:32.746 --> 38:33.372
What?

38:33.869 --> 38:38.286
A friend of mine discovered an awkward
situation with one of your investors.

38:40.502 --> 38:41.391
And?

38:41.421 --> 38:44.988
Fortunately, this friend spoke to this
investor and reassured him that

38:45.018 --> 38:47.255
because he's a
business associate of yours,

38:49.077 --> 38:51.891
this little indiscretion
would be forgotten.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.360
As long as he's in business
with me, he's sake.

38:58.595 --> 39:00.334
Something along those lines.

39:10.026 --> 39:11.219
Is that a smile?

39:12.215 --> 39:14.267
I've not seen you smile for a while.

39:15.909 --> 39:18.508
So, once all this has blown over...

39:19.686 --> 39:21.465
we won't need
Negrescu's account anymore.

39:22.833 --> 39:25.296
Why do you think the
investor changed his mind?

40:11.238 --> 40:12.000
Sorry.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.766
Georgina!
Hi, um,

40:18.176 --> 40:21.987
If it's not a bad time, I thought
maybe we could go for a drink.

40:25.142 --> 40:28.777
Um, it's not actually a good time.
Is everything ok?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.677
Yeah, yeah, of course

40:32.261 --> 40:33.160
I just...

40:36.287 --> 40:38.261
Adam, are you there?
Yeah.

40:38.781 --> 40:40.970
Sorry, um, don't worry.

40:42.162 --> 40:42.963
I'll see you later.

40:52.692 --> 40:54.940
Doesn't look like the kind of place
a billionaire would call home.

40:56.406 --> 40:58.399
He must have left
this ticket for a reason.

41:01.559 --> 41:02.478
Maybe he won.

41:03.298 --> 41:06.289
Maybe it's a winning ticket and he
was too embarrassed to collect it.

41:06.738 --> 41:07.911
I am not embarrassed.

41:14.922 --> 41:15.469
Monsieur...

41:21.671 --> 41:24.212
A wish for winning,
I hope you win.

41:25.072 --> 41:26.694
No winner.

41:29.196 --> 41:30.505
Keep it,

41:31.194 --> 41:33.422
this little thing
will bring you good luck.

41:37.409 --> 41:38.543
I think that means no.

41:42.512 --> 41:45.541
You know, it could have been worse.
How could it be worse?

41:46.304 --> 41:47.515
You could have had children.

41:53.182 --> 41:55.078
Maybe I was wrong, Georgie.

41:55.449 --> 41:57.071
Maybe there was no message, after all.

42:20.707 --> 42:21.684
I found him.

42:24.255 --> 42:25.681
I found John Brandeis

42:41.478 --> 42:43.570
My love, you know
I trust you implicitly.

42:44.884 --> 42:46.642
You know how bad I actually...

42:47.405 --> 42:49.555
Everything I have is yours.

42:50.180 --> 42:51.372
Hidden in plain sight.

42:52.257 --> 42:56.009
Georgina, I love you and I always will.

42:58.174 --> 43:01.868
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

43:01.898 --> 43:05.210
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

43:05.240 --> 43:12.732
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

43:12.903 --> 43:22.903
