I do not.

I am so glad, we spent our
life savings on this commercial.

That is not a commercial!

33
00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.332
That is cinema.

34
00:05:21.374 --> 00:05:22.291
Eh, what about the accents?

00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:51.166
Have you even gotten one call, since
you left me to start your dumb company?

As a matter of fact, Spike...

51
00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.291
We have.

52
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.291
Wow, really?

53
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:56.541
Uh, yeah.

54
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.291
Our mom called and she said,

55
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.291
"Oh, boys! That's the best
commercial I've ever seen."

56
00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:02.832
And I said,
"Thank you very much, mother.

57
00:06:02.832 --> 00:06:04.291
We're very proud of it."

58
00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.832

Say that again about my brother,
and you're gonna regret it.

Oh, yeah?

62
00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:24.041
Get this through
your tiny brain, Mario.

63
00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:25.666
You're a joke!

64
00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:28.416
And you always will be.

65
00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.749

You know, you can't
be scared all the time.

69
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:44.416
Mmm, you'd be surprised.

70
00:06:50.624 --> 00:06:52.916
Hello, Super Mario Brothers.

can be there and we can fix it right away.

Get off from there!

88
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.457
You can't be here!

89
00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:54.874

00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:25.624
Very confident, sir.

99
00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:27.540

142
00:11:49.498 --> 00:11:51.165
Yeah, but what's
with the outfits?

143
00:11:51.207 --> 00:11:53.082

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.665
We got to get to
that pressure valve.

187
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.040
Mario, really?

188
00:14:45.498 --> 00:14:48.373
I knew saving Brooklyn was a bad idea.

189
00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:49.623
Come on.

190
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.081
Woah!

191
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.206
What is this place?

192
00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:36.498
Looks like nobody's been
down here for years.

193
00:15:38.123 --> 00:15:39.040
Luigi?

194
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:43.331
Luigi, are you in there?

195
00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:50.706
Luigi!

196
00:15:53.873 --> 00:15:55.248
What?

197
00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:26.956
Luigi!

198
00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:28.165
Mario!

199
00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:33.331
Gimme your hand!

200
00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:35.165
It's all gonna be okay!

201
00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:36.748
How is this gonna be okay?!

202
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.706
I'm telling you!

203
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:40.290
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together!

204
00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:44.915
Mario!

205
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:48.248
Luigi!

206
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.373
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

207
00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:29.664
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.123
That one's perfectly fine.

209
00:17:31.164 --> 00:17:32.831
Ah, it's a little mushroom man.

210
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:34.706
A little mushroom man,
talking to me.

211
00:17:34.748 --> 00:17:35.664
Pleased to meet ya!

212
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:36.956
I'm Toad.

213
00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:39.914
Uh, Mario.

214
00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:43.664
So this uh...

215
00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:46.081
This is, this is not a dream?

216
00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:46.914
That hurt, right?

217
00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:47.914
Yes!

218
00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:49.206
Definitely, not a dream.

219
00:17:49.956 --> 00:17:50.706
Then, then...

220
00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:54.581
- This place is...
- The Mushroom Kingdom!

221
00:17:54.623 --> 00:17:56.289
Mushrooms, really?

222
00:17:56.331 --> 00:17:57.998
Now, that is a cruel twist of fate.

223
00:18:04.123 --> 00:18:04.956
Hello.

224
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:08.664
Yeah, I'm actually looking for somebody.

225
00:18:08.664 --> 00:18:09.914
My brother, in fact.

226
00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:13.039
He looks exactly like me,
but tall, and skinny, and green.

227
00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:15.706
See, last time I saw him,
he was falling through a pipe.

228
00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:17.914
It was foggy and I believe there was lava.

229
00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:21.539
Uh, that is not good.

230
00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:22.539
Umm...

231
00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:25.914
Your brother has landed in the Dark Lands.

232
00:18:25.914 --> 00:18:29.039
They're under Bowser's control.

233
00:18:29.706 --> 00:18:30.748
Bowser?

234
00:18:30.748 --> 00:18:34.289
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

235
00:18:38.373 --> 00:18:40.331
I'm taking you to see the princess.

236
00:18:40.373 --> 00:18:41.331
She can help.

237
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:42.956
She can do anything.

238
00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:44.831
Princess?

239
00:18:49.873 --> 00:18:50.956
Come on, Mario!

240
00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:53.331
Our big adventure begins now!

241
00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:54.789
Hang on, Luigi.

242
00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:23.748
Mario?

243
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:25.206
Mario?

244
00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.539
Where are you?

245
00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:28.914
Huh?

246
00:20:08.414 --> 00:20:09.414
Haha!

247
00:20:09.414 --> 00:20:10.456
Yes!

248
00:20:10.456 --> 00:20:13.331
You just got a-Luigi'd.

249
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.539
This way, Mario!

250
00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:34.122
The princess is right up that hill.

251
00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:44.789
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

252
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:46.581
Got a big adventure happening, right now.

253
00:21:46.581 --> 00:21:48.247
Clear a path for us.

254
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:49.372
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

255
00:21:49.414 --> 00:21:50.581
Excuse me.

256
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:53.081
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

257
00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:56.539
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

258
00:21:56.539 --> 00:21:57.706
Out of the way, please!

259
00:21:57.706 --> 00:21:59.331
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

260
00:21:59.372 --> 00:22:00.664
He's gonna be fine.

261
00:22:00.664 --> 00:22:01.706
- Shake Shroom!
- Morning!

262
00:22:01.747 --> 00:22:03.289
Nice to see ya, bud.

263
00:22:05.622 --> 00:22:07.331
Does this thing work?

264
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:08.247
Yeah, it works great.

265
00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:10.414
Hey, you just have to blow into it.

266
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.997
And...
Up, we go.

267
00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.206
Wait, up?

268
00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:36.706
Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here?

269
00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.664
Just pop in this pipe
and we're on our way.

270
00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:41.414
The only way to fly, man.

271
00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.372
Oh, wow.
Love these pipes.

272
00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:09.664
Aw, come on!

273
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:14.914
Here we are.

274
00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:15.664
Palace doors.

275
00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:16.706
Bing, bang, boom.

276
00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.206
Come on, haha.

277
00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:22.581
Woo!

278
00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:24.122
Woah.

279
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:32.664
Pretty impressive,
am I right?

280
00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.206
Hold it right there, you two.

281
00:23:38.247 --> 00:23:39.081
Oh, hey.

282
00:23:39.122 --> 00:23:41.164
I need to see the princess.

283
00:23:41.206 --> 00:23:42.331
It's an emergency.

284
00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:45.789
What princess?

285
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:47.664
I never heard of any princess.

286
00:23:47.706 --> 00:23:48.789
Oh, wait.
I did.

287
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:51.081
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

288
00:23:51.122 --> 00:23:52.497
Oh, yeah. That's right.

289
00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:54.372
You should try
another castle, maybe.

290
00:23:54.414 --> 00:23:56.372
She ain't in this one.

291
00:23:56.372 --> 00:23:57.122
Huh?

292
00:23:57.122 --> 00:23:58.956
Okay, so they're
messing with you.

293
00:23:58.997 --> 00:23:59.706
And...

294
00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.039
I don't like it.

295
00:24:04.956 --> 00:24:06.081
What do you guys, um...

296
00:24:06.122 --> 00:24:07.289
What you wanna eat?

297
00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:09.164
Anything your heart desires.

298
00:24:09.164 --> 00:24:09.789
Go!

299
00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:12.331
And we're gonna scramble it up.

300
00:24:19.664 --> 00:24:21.747
- Hey!
- Intruder!

301
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:23.164
Stop him!

302
00:24:23.164 --> 00:24:25.330
- Intruder!
- Stop him!

303
00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:27.247
Back to work!
We know!

304
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:28.705
Stop him!

305
00:24:43.372 --> 00:24:45.289
Council, your attention!

306
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.872
Bowser has found the Super Star
and is headed toward our Kingdom.

307
00:24:49.914 --> 00:24:52.997
Its power will
make him invincible.

308
00:24:52.997 --> 00:24:54.997
We will be destroyed.

309
00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:59.622
Princess, what are we gonna do?

310
00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.914
I will not let him hurt you.

311
00:25:07.747 --> 00:25:10.330
We are going to stop Bowser.

312
00:25:10.372 --> 00:25:11.122
How?

313
00:25:11.122 --> 00:25:12.080
Look at us...

314
00:25:12.122 --> 00:25:13.747
We're adorable.

315
00:25:13.747 --> 00:25:17.705
I'm going to convince the
great Kong Army to help us.

316
00:25:17.747 --> 00:25:20.664
Together, we'll annihilate that monster.

317
00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:23.414
Their mad king doesn't make alliances.

318
00:25:23.414 --> 00:25:25.705
The Kongs will never agree.

319
00:25:25.705 --> 00:25:27.664
I can convince him.

320
00:25:27.705 --> 00:25:30.122
I'll leave for the Jungle Kingdom,
in the morning.

321
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.997
Good luck, Princess.

322
00:25:32.997 --> 00:25:34.830
For all our sakes.

323
00:25:43.872 --> 00:25:48.330
Princess...

324
00:25:52.414 --> 00:25:53.622
Princess, I...

325
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.580
Wait!
Release him.

326
00:26:03.414 --> 00:26:04.747
Are you...

327
00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:07.830
He's a human!

328
00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.622
I mean...
You are human, right?

329
00:26:09.664 --> 00:26:12.164
- It's just, you're so small.
- Hey!

330
00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:13.789
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go back.

331
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.122
Where did you come from?

332
00:26:15.414 --> 00:26:17.414
Me and my little brother, Luigi.

333
00:26:17.455 --> 00:26:19.039
We fell down this pipe.

334
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.747
And now, he's lost,
somewhere in the Dark Lands.

335
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:25.664
Then, it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

336
00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:27.039
But you're in luck.

337
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.830
I'm on my way to stop him.

338
00:26:28.872 --> 00:26:30.414
Well, take me with you.

339
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:31.997
This guy's a lunatic.

340
00:26:31.997 --> 00:26:33.414
A psycho.

341
00:26:33.455 --> 00:26:35.539
He will eat you for breakfast.

342
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.664
He won't even notice it probably.

343
00:26:37.664 --> 00:26:40.372
Cause you're very, very small.

344
00:26:40.414 --> 00:26:42.414
You know what,
make fun of me all you want.

345
00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:44.289
But you're gonna help me find my brother.

346
00:26:45.955 --> 00:26:47.122
Please?

347
00:26:48.664 --> 00:26:49.914
Okay.

348
00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:51.705
Let's see what you're made of.

349
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.039
Is that a yes?

350
00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:54.705
No.

351
00:26:54.747 --> 00:26:58.205
That's a, "Let's see what you're made of".

352
00:27:46.788 --> 00:27:48.413
If you can finish this,

353
00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:49.830
you're coming with me.

354
00:27:49.872 --> 00:27:51.622
Watch and learn.

355
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.122
That was amazing.

356
00:28:36.122 --> 00:28:36.788
Wait...

357
00:28:36.788 --> 00:28:38.288
How am I supposed to do that?

358
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.705
With the power-ups.

359
00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:42.122
They give us special abilities.

360
00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:45.372
Ugh!

361
00:28:45.372 --> 00:28:46.372
Really?!

362
00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:47.288
Go on...

363
00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:48.330
Eat it.

364
00:28:49.788 --> 00:28:50.955
Ugh!

365
00:28:53.205 --> 00:28:54.580
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

366
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.913
Cause I just,
hate mushrooms and...

367
00:28:56.913 --> 00:28:58.788
Okay, okay...

368
00:29:00.497 --> 00:29:01.413
Are you sure
there's not like a...

369
00:29:01.455 --> 00:29:04.788
Down the hatch!
Yep, there it is. And all gone.

370
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.413
Not cool!

371
00:29:23.997 --> 00:29:25.080
I'm tall.

372
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.288
And strong.

373
00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:30.663
And, you can jump.

374
00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:33.997
I got this.
No problem.

375
00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:47.705
Oh, yeah.

376
00:29:47.747 --> 00:29:50.247
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

377
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.372
Great...

378
00:29:57.038 --> 00:29:58.663
Come on, try again.

379
00:31:11.372 --> 00:31:12.580
Well...

380
00:31:12.622 --> 00:31:15.913
We have a long journey
ahead of us, moustache.

381
00:31:15.955 --> 00:31:17.163
But I didn't make it.

382
00:31:17.163 --> 00:31:18.538
You almost did.

383
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.288
No one gets it right away.

384
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.288
How many tries did it take you?

385
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.288
Oh! So many...

386
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.455
I was not good at it.

387
00:31:26.496 --> 00:31:28.038
Worse than you.

388
00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:29.580
You got it right away, didn't you?

389
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.163
I got it right away, but I grew up here.

390
00:31:32.163 --> 00:31:32.788
Okay.

391
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.413
Now, you're just trying
to make me feel better.

392
00:31:34.413 --> 00:31:35.621
No!

393
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:37.246
No...

394
00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:39.205
Is it working?

395
00:31:39.246 --> 00:31:41.538
A little bit, yeah.

396
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.496
My army!

397
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.371
Koopas!

398
00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:15.913
Goombas!

399
00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:18.080
Whatever those things are.

400
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:23.246
After years of searching for
the Super Star, it is finally ours!

401
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.163
I am now, the most
powerful turtle in the world!

402
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:30.955
Soon, we will arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom.

403
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:34.830
Where after years of being sworn enemies,

404
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:40.121
I will ask their princess to
marry me in a fairy tale wedding!

405
00:32:42.455 --> 00:32:44.205
Yeah...

406
00:32:44.246 --> 00:32:46.413
Did he say marry their princess?

407
00:32:46.413 --> 00:32:48.080
Doesn't she hate you?

408
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.163
Of course, she hates me.

409
00:32:50.205 --> 00:32:52.871
But that makes me love her, all the more.

410
00:32:52.871 --> 00:32:54.871
Her heart-shaped bangs.

411
00:32:54.871 --> 00:32:57.371
The way she floats in the breeze.

412
00:32:57.371 --> 00:32:59.580
Her immovable tiara.

413
00:32:59.621 --> 00:33:01.663
And when she sees this Star...

414
00:33:01.663 --> 00:33:04.705
Oh, ho, ho, ho,
wedding bells.

415
00:33:04.705 --> 00:33:06.496
Well, what if she says no?

416
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:13.080
Then, I will power up with this Star
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom.

417
00:33:13.955 --> 00:33:17.038
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

418
00:33:17.288 --> 00:33:19.621
It's gonna rock!

419
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.455
They're all counting on us.

420
00:34:31.496 --> 00:34:33.246
No pressure.

421
00:34:45.038 --> 00:34:46.288
My toads!

422
00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:49.288
Our days of terror are almost over.

423
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:51.371
With the help of the Kong Army,

424
00:34:51.371 --> 00:34:53.121
we will stop...

425
00:34:53.163 --> 00:34:55.246
Uh...
Who's he?

426
00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:59.329
He's not important!

427
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:17.496
Nervous?

428
00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:18.496
Who, me?

429
00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:19.996
Yes...

430
00:35:20.038 --> 00:35:20.829

What?

458
00:37:21.663 --> 00:37:24.496
A report from our intelligence.

459
00:37:24.496 --> 00:37:28.913
A mustachioed human has
arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom.

460
00:37:29.996 --> 00:37:32.413
The princess has been training him.

461
00:37:32.413 --> 00:37:34.954
They are up to something, sire.

462
00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:39.246
Sit...

463
00:37:39.288 --> 00:37:40.954
Jam with me.

464
00:37:45.038 --> 00:37:46.871
This human...

465
00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:48.454
Where did he come from?

466
00:37:48.454 --> 00:37:49.454
We...

467
00:37:49.496 --> 00:37:51.038
aren't sure?

468
00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:53.788
Does the princess like him?

469
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:54.829
Sire...

470
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:56.329
Look in the mirror!

471
00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:58.746
You have nothing to worry about.

472
00:37:58.746 --> 00:37:59.746
I know that.

473
00:37:59.788 --> 00:38:01.496
I'm not threatened.

474
00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:07.704
Find out who he is,
and what they're plotting!

475
00:38:07.746 --> 00:38:09.954
I'm on it, sire.

476
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.204
May I lift the cover?

477
00:38:12.204 --> 00:38:13.121
Not yet.

478
00:38:13.162 --> 00:38:15.329
Pain is the best teacher.

479
00:38:26.412 --> 00:38:27.912
Thinking about your brother?

480
00:38:28.412 --> 00:38:30.412
We've never been apart this long.

481
00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:31.746
Don't worry...

482
00:38:31.746 --> 00:38:33.204
We're going to save him.

483
00:38:49.412 --> 00:38:51.996
You don't seem,
like you're from here.

484
00:38:52.412 --> 00:38:54.704
I don't know where I'm from.

485
00:38:54.912 --> 00:38:55.746
Really?

486
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:57.037
Yep.

487
00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:00.371
My earliest memory is arriving.

488
00:39:07.287 --> 00:39:09.246
I was so lucky they found me.

489
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.162
They took me in...

490
00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:15.079
Raised me, like one of their own...

491
00:39:15.204 --> 00:39:18.454
And, when I was ready...

492
00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:22.412
they made me their princess.

493
00:39:25.954 --> 00:39:27.746
Hey, maybe, you're from my world.

494
00:39:29.537 --> 00:39:34.954
There's a huge universe out there,
with a lot of galaxies.

495
00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:21.037
We found him in the Dark Lands.

496
00:40:26.246 --> 00:40:27.704
Leave him to me.

497
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:38.537
What is your name?

498
00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:39.704
Uh...

499
00:40:39.746 --> 00:40:41.079
Luigi.

500
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.329
Not sure if you know who I am,

501
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:47.996
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

502
00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:49.287
Wow!

503
00:40:50.496 --> 00:40:51.371
Yay...

504
00:40:51.996 --> 00:40:55.204
But there's one problem, Luigi.

505
00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:58.287
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

506
00:40:58.287 --> 00:41:01.496
Has a mustache,
just like you.

507
00:41:01.496 --> 00:41:03.162
Do you know him?

508
00:41:03.204 --> 00:41:04.287
No.

509
00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:05.246
No!

510
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.287
Ah! A tough one, I see.

511
00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:09.037
Maybe, this will get you to talk.

512
00:41:10.162 --> 00:41:12.246
Do you think I know every
human being with a mustache,

513
00:41:12.287 --> 00:41:16.287
wearing an identical outfit, with a hat
with the letter of his first name on it?

514
00:41:16.329 --> 00:41:17.787
Because I don't.

515
00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:21.287
- Do you know him?!
- Yes!

516
00:41:21.329 --> 00:41:22.287
Stop! Stop!

517
00:41:22.287 --> 00:41:23.246
That's how I know him.

518
00:41:23.246 --> 00:41:23.996
Yes, I know him.

519
00:41:24.037 --> 00:41:25.454
Yeah.
He's my brother, Mario.

520
00:41:25.454 --> 00:41:27.996
And he's the best guy in the world!

521
00:41:28.037 --> 00:41:30.579
Do princesses find him attractive?

522
00:41:30.912 --> 00:41:33.787
They do, if we have good teeth!

523
00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:36.871
Get him out of my sight!

524
00:41:36.871 --> 00:41:41.287
We'll see how tough this Mario is,
when he watches me kill his brother!

525
00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:55.704
Where am I?

526
00:41:59.954 --> 00:42:00.954
Home.

527
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.995
Pay him no heed.

528
00:42:04.162 --> 00:42:06.995
He is cute,
but he is...

529
00:42:06.995 --> 00:42:11.412
In an insane world,
it is the sane who is called crazy.

530
00:42:16.162 --> 00:42:17.745
How long you guys been in here?

531
00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:18.704
Time...

532
00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:21.287
Like hope, is an illusion.

533
00:42:21.287 --> 00:42:23.370
Please, we are depressed enough!

534
00:42:23.745 --> 00:42:25.620
There's gotta be a way out of here.

535
00:42:25.662 --> 00:42:27.204
There's no escape.

536
00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:28.912
The only hope,

537
00:42:28.912 --> 00:42:31.287
is the sweet relief of death.

538
00:42:31.287 --> 00:42:32.245
No!

539
00:42:32.245 --> 00:42:34.620
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

540
00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.704
You ready?

541
00:42:59.704 --> 00:43:00.454
Eh...

542
00:43:00.454 --> 00:43:01.620
Sure?

543
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.120
What...

544
00:43:12.912 --> 00:43:14.329
How you doing?

545
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:17.037
We are here to see the king.

546
00:43:19.704 --> 00:43:21.329
Follow me.

547
00:43:22.162 --> 00:43:23.620
That gorilla's
wearing a sports cup.

548
00:43:23.662 --> 00:43:25.412
I feel underdressed.

549
00:43:30.662 --> 00:43:31.787
Hop in.

550
00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:46.287
Oh, by all means, come in.

551
00:44:58.037 --> 00:45:00.579
Great and mighty Cranky Kong.

552
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.454
So, I heard you want my army.

553
00:45:03.787 --> 00:45:06.162
Yes, your Highness.

554
00:45:06.162 --> 00:45:10.120
Without your help,
the Mushroom Kingdom will be annihilated.

555
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.453
What makes you think,
you're worthy of fighting alongside,

556
00:45:15.495 --> 00:45:20.495
the greatest army in the world!

557
00:45:20.495 --> 00:45:22.328
Because we have heart.

558
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.953
And with your strength...

559
00:45:23.953 --> 00:45:25.828
We can win.

560
00:45:26.412 --> 00:45:27.620
Okay, fine.

561
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.412
That's it?

562
00:45:28.453 --> 00:45:29.870
No, that's not it.

563
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.703
The answer is no.

564
00:45:31.745 --> 00:45:32.578
Goodbye.

565
00:45:32.703 --> 00:45:34.453
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls,

566
00:45:34.453 --> 00:45:36.203
the Jungle Kingdom is next.

567
00:45:36.245 --> 00:45:39.870
We're not leaving,
without your army.

568
00:45:43.203 --> 00:45:44.287
Who is this guy?

569
00:45:44.328 --> 00:45:45.953
Oh, he makes me laugh.

570
00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:49.703
Alright, tough guy.

571
00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:52.495
You want my army so badly.

572
00:45:52.495 --> 00:45:57.870
Defeat my son,
in the great ring of Kong!

573
00:45:59.578 --> 00:46:01.037
Give us a second.

574
00:46:01.037 --> 00:46:03.787
This is a really, really bad idea.

575
00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:05.912
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

576
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.245
Are you two done whispering?

577
00:46:08.245 --> 00:46:10.037
It's a little rude.

578
00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:14.120
You, sir, have a deal.

579
00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.703
I'll fight your son, and win.

580
00:46:16.745 --> 00:46:18.578
I'm sure you will.

581
00:47:08.328 --> 00:47:10.578
I'm DK.

582
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.578
I'm Donkey Kong.

583
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.912
Oh, yeah.

584
00:47:15.495 --> 00:47:16.662
Hi, dad!

585
00:47:16.662 --> 00:47:17.828
No, don't!

586
00:47:17.828 --> 00:47:19.120
Don't do that!

587
00:47:19.162 --> 00:47:20.537
Dad, wave back!

588
00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:22.703
Enough with the showboating!

589
00:47:22.703 --> 00:47:24.787
What do you mean?!
They like it!

590
00:47:24.787 --> 00:47:26.537
It's what they came here for!

591
00:47:26.578 --> 00:47:28.745
Dancing pecs!

592
00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:31.620
Okay, simmer down.

593
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.620
I said, simmer down!

594
00:47:33.662 --> 00:47:34.537
DK! DK!

595
00:47:34.578 --> 00:47:36.287
That means you, Diddy Kong!

596
00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:37.162
D...

597
00:47:37.203 --> 00:47:38.370
Sorry.

598
00:47:38.412 --> 00:47:39.328
Now...

599
00:47:39.328 --> 00:47:43.495
Since I want this fight to
last more than five seconds,

600
00:47:43.495 --> 00:47:46.662
I put power-ups
around the arena.

601
00:47:46.703 --> 00:47:48.662
You're welcome, Mario.

602
00:47:48.662 --> 00:47:53.828
I don't need anything special
to break every bone in your tiny body.

603
00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:02.870
All right.

604
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:16.203
Oh, my...

605
00:48:16.245 --> 00:48:17.120
Okay...

606
00:48:17.162 --> 00:48:19.370
Guess you're not getting my army.

607
00:48:24.578 --> 00:48:26.828
Is this what you came for?!

608
00:48:26.995 --> 00:48:28.828
I love you, DK!

609
00:48:31.162 --> 00:48:33.537
Hi, dad!
Love you!

610
00:48:37.745 --> 00:48:41.745
It is on,
like Donkey Kong!

611
00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:51.161
You're about to pick on
someone, your own size.

612
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.911
I guess, he got the wrong mushroom.

613
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.245
Get up, Mario!

614
00:49:58.495 --> 00:49:59.745
Had enough?

615
00:49:59.745 --> 00:50:03.036
Not even close.

616
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.453
Mario...

617
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:19.328
It's-a me...

618
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.870
The box...

619
00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:41.578
He looks adorable.

620
00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.870
He really does.

621
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.745
Oh, what?
I'm a cat?

622
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.661
You got the cat box!

623
00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:48.995
Oh, my...

624
00:50:50.328 --> 00:50:51.620
Oh, I'm sorry...

625
00:50:51.661 --> 00:50:52.495
I'm sorry.

626
00:50:52.536 --> 00:50:53.453
Okay...

627
00:50:53.578 --> 00:50:54.370
Now, you die.

628
00:50:56.536 --> 00:50:58.161
I'm a cat.

629
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.120
Meow.

630
00:51:40.411 --> 00:51:41.828
Had enough?

631
00:51:42.245 --> 00:51:46.078
Not even close.

632
00:51:47.786 --> 00:51:50.036
I'll take that as a yes.

633
00:51:57.661 --> 00:51:58.620
Yes!

634
00:51:58.661 --> 00:52:00.203
That's my best friend!

635
00:52:00.245 --> 00:52:04.161
Mario! Mario! Mario!

636
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:06.661
Yeah, yeah...

637
00:52:09.786 --> 00:52:12.411
That was incredible!

638
00:52:12.453 --> 00:52:16.619
He kept beating you senseless,
and you just kept getting back up?

639
00:52:16.661 --> 00:52:18.619
You just don't know when to quit.

640
00:52:18.661 --> 00:52:19.328
Huh...

641
00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.286
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

642
00:52:21.286 --> 00:52:23.203
It's a great thing.

643
00:52:23.494 --> 00:52:24.369
Thanks.

644
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:25.286
I...

645
00:52:25.328 --> 00:52:27.661
I let him win,
just for the record.

646
00:52:27.703 --> 00:52:29.494
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

647
00:52:29.536 --> 00:52:30.786
You want to know why?

648
00:52:30.828 --> 00:52:33.869
It's, mind your own business,
that's why!

649
00:52:33.911 --> 00:52:35.078
Alright, giant monkey.

650
00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:36.494
Enough!

651
00:52:36.536 --> 00:52:38.078
Get inside!

652
00:52:39.869 --> 00:52:42.328
We've located Bowser's ship.

653
00:52:42.369 --> 00:52:46.494
He's gonna arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom, by sundown.

654
00:52:46.494 --> 00:52:48.119
Lucky for you, guys.

655
00:52:48.161 --> 00:52:49.953
I got a shortcut.

656
00:52:49.953 --> 00:52:52.786
We beat him there and ambush him.

657
00:52:53.328 --> 00:52:55.369
Yeah, I know.

658
00:52:55.369 --> 00:52:59.286
That's why, we're gonna need karts!

659
00:53:16.953 --> 00:53:18.828
Well, what are you waiting for?

660
00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:22.494
Pick your karts!

661
00:54:21.161 --> 00:54:22.828
I hate you.

662
00:54:22.828 --> 00:54:26.911
To the Mushroom Kingdom,
and the biggest fight of our lives.

663
00:54:26.953 --> 00:54:28.911
Here we go!

664
00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:49.244
Princess Peach...

665
00:54:49.244 --> 00:54:50.994
Here we are...

666
00:54:51.036 --> 00:54:54.786
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

667
00:54:58.703 --> 00:55:01.786
Let's rule the world, together.

668
00:55:01.828 --> 00:55:03.078
Forever...

669
00:55:03.078 --> 00:55:05.244
Will you marry me?

670
00:55:05.286 --> 00:55:06.911
Oh, yes!

671
00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:10.161
What?!

672
00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:13.536
We have found the princess
and the mustachioed human.

673
00:55:13.578 --> 00:55:17.703
He has defeated Donkey Kong,
and won the Kong Army.

674
00:55:17.869 --> 00:55:19.828
So, like Peach was
super impressed?

675
00:55:19.828 --> 00:55:21.703
It appears so, yes.

676
00:55:21.703 --> 00:55:23.994
They are heading
toward the secret passage!

677
00:55:23.994 --> 00:55:26.619
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

678
00:55:26.661 --> 00:55:28.786
Two can play at that game.

679
00:55:50.786 --> 00:55:51.786
Um...

680
00:55:51.827 --> 00:55:55.202
No one panic,
but the road is about to end.

681
00:55:55.244 --> 00:55:59.327
Well then, you better step
on the gas and buckle up!

682
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:29.494
Woo-hoo!

683
00:56:30.577 --> 00:56:32.952
Is there anything like this, in your world?

684
00:56:32.952 --> 00:56:33.994
What?!

685
00:56:33.994 --> 00:56:37.327
Is there anything like this, in your world?!

686
00:56:38.286 --> 00:56:39.244
No...

687
00:56:39.286 --> 00:56:41.327
We don't drive on rainbows.

688
00:56:41.369 --> 00:56:43.077
What are you gonna tell me next?

689
00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:44.786
That the turtles aren't evil?

690
00:56:44.786 --> 00:56:45.869
No, no.

691
00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.286
They're usually pets.

692
00:56:47.327 --> 00:56:48.577
No way!

693
00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:50.619
Yeah! Come to Brooklyn,
I'll buy you a turtle.

694
00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:53.577
Maybe, I will.

695
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:55.869
Dude, is this you flirting?!

696
00:56:55.911 --> 00:56:56.952
This is painful!

697
00:56:56.994 --> 00:56:58.536
Listen, I was trying to be nice.

698
00:56:58.536 --> 00:57:00.161
You are so embarrassing!

699
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:02.452
A princess would never go out with you!

700
00:57:02.494 --> 00:57:03.411
Yes, she would!

701
00:57:03.452 --> 00:57:04.702
I guarantee, she would!

702
00:57:04.702 --> 00:57:05.702
Guys!

703
00:57:05.702 --> 00:57:06.536
Enough!

704
00:57:07.036 --> 00:57:08.661
Alright, alright.

705
00:57:17.494 --> 00:57:18.952
Charge!

706
00:57:28.327 --> 00:57:29.452
It's an ambush!

707
00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:34.536
Defensive position!

708
00:57:50.119 --> 00:57:51.036
Mario...

709
00:57:51.036 --> 00:57:53.619
You're a dead man!

710
00:57:56.286 --> 00:57:57.619
Split up!

711
00:57:59.702 --> 00:58:01.327
Mario!

712
00:58:18.786 --> 00:58:20.202
Haha!

713
00:59:17.202 --> 00:59:19.577
I'm too cute to die!

714
00:59:29.369 --> 00:59:31.994
That is how you princess!

715
00:59:43.702 --> 00:59:45.744
Time to die, Mario.

716
01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.327
See ya!

717
01:00:08.869 --> 01:00:10.202
No!

718
01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.077
Woo-hoo!

719
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:15.910
Haha!

720
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.244
Yeah!

721
01:00:23.952 --> 01:00:27.119
You, can't escape me.

722
01:00:27.285 --> 01:00:28.244
What?

723
01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:31.452
Blue shell!

724
01:00:45.702 --> 01:00:47.119
No!

725
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.327
No, Mario...

726
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:51.744
No!

727
01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:52.910
No...

728
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.244
No!

729
01:00:54.244 --> 01:00:55.035
Oh, no!

730
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.910
No...

731
01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:02.119
Get your clown claws off of me!

732
01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:07.035
Goodbye, Mario.

733
01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:09.369
We have to get home.

734
01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.910
Hey, this is your fault!

735
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:19.869
My fault?

736
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.244
- You're the one...
- Stop talking!

737
01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.785
I don't want the last thing I hear,
before I die, to be your...

738
01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.869
Mario...

739
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.369
You saved my life.

740
01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.452
Yeah, well...

741
01:01:59.452 --> 01:02:00.577
I won't tell anyone.

742
01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:02.244
Good, please don't.

743
01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:02.994
Okay...

744
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:05.827
Uh...

745
01:02:05.827 --> 01:02:08.369
Did you just feel something?

746
01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:11.494
Swim!

747
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.410
Browser's on his way.

748
01:02:30.452 --> 01:02:32.410
You have to evacuate.

749
01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.368
Hurry!

750
01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:37.577
Get out of the city!

751
01:02:50.243 --> 01:02:51.535
Princess?

752
01:02:52.077 --> 01:02:55.785
We lost the Army,
and Mario's gone.

753
01:02:57.577 --> 01:02:59.660
Bowser is coming.

754
01:02:59.702 --> 01:03:00.910
Head into the forest!

755
01:03:00.952 --> 01:03:02.410
I'll buy you some time.

756
01:03:02.618 --> 01:03:03.535
You heard her!

757
01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:06.243
Evacuate the city!

758
01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:08.285
Go with the others.

759
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.910
I said, I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

760
01:03:20.952 --> 01:03:23.077
Just leave it!
There's no time!

761
01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:20.285
Princess Peach...

762
01:04:20.285 --> 01:04:22.618
Brave as ever.

763
01:04:24.452 --> 01:04:28.118
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

764
01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:30.660
If you're going to use it...

765
01:04:30.702 --> 01:04:32.327
Use it now!

766
01:04:34.952 --> 01:04:36.535
No, Princess...

767
01:04:36.577 --> 01:04:39.368
I stole this Star for us.

768
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:43.577
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

769
01:04:45.702 --> 01:04:47.827
I told you that line wouldn't work.

770
01:04:47.827 --> 01:04:49.868
You're doing great!

771
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:54.493
Peaches, with this Star,
we will be invincible.

772
01:04:54.535 --> 01:04:58.868
We can rule the world together, forever.

773
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:00.660
Will you marry me?

774
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.327
Marry you?

775
01:05:02.368 --> 01:05:03.743
Are you insane?!

776
01:05:03.785 --> 01:05:05.993
I would never marry you!

777
01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.952
Maybe, you should reconsider.

778
01:05:11.535 --> 01:05:12.618
No!

779
01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:15.160
Stop!

780
01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:17.160
Please, stop!

781
01:05:17.202 --> 01:05:20.160
I'll marry you,
just don't hurt my toads!

782
01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.952
You have my word.

783
01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.910
Haha, time for a wedding!

784
01:05:49.618 --> 01:05:51.410
♪ Life is sad ♪

785
01:05:51.452 --> 01:05:53.077
♪ Prison is sad ♪

786
01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:58.327
♪ Life and prison is very, very sad ♪

787
01:06:04.576 --> 01:06:07.451
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

788
01:06:07.493 --> 01:06:10.035
Who's this ray of sunshine?

789
01:06:10.076 --> 01:06:11.660
There's no sunshine...

790
01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.076
only darkness.

791
01:06:13.118 --> 01:06:15.410
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

792
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:17.701
Hello, prisoners...

793
01:06:17.743 --> 01:06:22.576
You don't deserve this, but you're
invited to the Royal Wedding!

794
01:06:22.576 --> 01:06:24.076
Yay!

795
01:06:24.076 --> 01:06:28.118
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed.

796
01:06:31.035 --> 01:06:32.535
Oh, no, no, no.

797
01:06:32.535 --> 01:06:34.993
Finally, mercy.

798
01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:38.160
Mario...

799
01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:52.368
So, this is the end...

800
01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:56.326
Being slowly digested by an eel,
next to an idiot in overalls.

801
01:06:56.326 --> 01:06:59.035
Well, at least, your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

802
01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:01.701
Least, you're not gonna die,
with your dad thinking you're a joke.

803
01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:04.660
Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a joke too.

804
01:07:04.826 --> 01:07:06.660
Yeah, well...

805
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.743
Your dad's right!

806
01:07:07.743 --> 01:07:09.618
You know what,
I feel bad enough.

807
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.910
Just, just, leave me alone.

808
01:07:10.951 --> 01:07:13.451
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant!

809
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:16.701
Just go in a corner and
smash some stuff, smash monkey.

810
01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:23.785
I, am, more, than a guy,
who smashes things!

811
01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.201
That was amazing!

812
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:56.826
Now, we're even.

813
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.201
Princess...

814
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:26.160
I got it!

815
01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.201
Great job.

816
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:29.993
Couldn't have you going out
there without your bouquet.

817
01:08:29.993 --> 01:08:31.493
It's perfect.

818
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.910
I'll be sacrificing them in your honor.

819
01:09:02.243 --> 01:09:03.910
Lower the prisoners!

820
01:09:12.493 --> 01:09:13.743
Dearly beloved...

821
01:09:14.243 --> 01:09:15.701
Huh?

822
01:09:15.701 --> 01:09:17.368
Drama...

823
01:09:17.368 --> 01:09:19.910
You really thought
I'd marry you?

824
01:09:20.743 --> 01:09:21.493
Kinda...

825
01:09:21.535 --> 01:09:23.993
I'd never marry a monster.

826
01:09:25.826 --> 01:09:28.701
Then we are breaking up, right now!

827
01:09:53.868 --> 01:09:55.284
They gotta be up there.

828
01:09:58.201 --> 01:09:59.243
Fire!

829
01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:08.909
You wanna do this?

830
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:10.451
Yes, I do.

831
01:10:19.909 --> 01:10:20.659
Yes!

832
01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:22.326
Fire!

833
01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:39.534
This is fun!

834
01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:42.409
Ha, loser!

835
01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:48.493
Hey, what does this do?

836
01:10:58.034 --> 01:10:59.534
Cool raccoon suit.

837
01:10:59.534 --> 01:11:01.326
- Really?
- Not at all!

838
01:11:33.868 --> 01:11:35.993
Whee!

839
01:11:49.659 --> 01:11:51.118
Boo...

840
01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:05.826
- Lou!
- Mario?!

841
01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:10.409
I told ya!

842
01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:10.909
See...

843
01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:14.868
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

844
01:12:17.576 --> 01:12:19.826
Mario, why do you look like a bear?
What is this?

845
01:12:23.868 --> 01:12:25.659
Ya did good, kid.

846
01:12:25.659 --> 01:12:28.368
Make your pecs dance,
you deserve it.

847
01:12:28.368 --> 01:12:30.868
No time now.
Definitely, later.

848
01:12:43.743 --> 01:12:48.368
Launch the Bomber Bill and
destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!

849
01:12:59.492 --> 01:13:01.409
No...

850
01:13:08.492 --> 01:13:09.534
Hey, hey...

851
01:13:09.534 --> 01:13:10.576
Hey, over here.

852
01:13:21.784 --> 01:13:23.617
You asked for it.

853
01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.201
Hello...

854
01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:58.576
Really?

855
01:14:03.492 --> 01:14:04.826
Follow me.

856
01:14:10.617 --> 01:14:11.867
Come on...

857
01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:16.784
Little closer...

858
01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:20.117
Mamma Mia!

859
01:14:31.326 --> 01:14:32.034
Huh?

860
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:00.284
That's beautiful.

861
01:15:00.326 --> 01:15:01.117
You make this right.

862
01:15:03.909 --> 01:15:05.659
Huh?

863
01:15:25.284 --> 01:15:27.867
Huh?

864
01:15:28.201 --> 01:15:29.326
Brooklyn?

865
01:15:30.867 --> 01:15:32.326
Mario?!

866
01:15:33.034 --> 01:15:34.201
You almost dented my...

867
01:16:06.451 --> 01:16:08.284
Mario!

868
01:16:13.326 --> 01:16:15.867
Don't you want this?

869
01:16:27.117 --> 01:16:29.450
You ruined my wedding!

870
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:32.200
I was finally gonna be happy!

871
01:16:34.075 --> 01:16:36.867
Now, you will suffer...

872
01:16:36.909 --> 01:16:39.242
like me!

873
01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:57.242
You really thought you could stop me?

874
01:16:57.284 --> 01:17:00.284
You worthless, weak little nothing.

875
01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:02.325
Come out and fight!

876
01:17:02.325 --> 01:17:04.450
Or are you too scared?

877
01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:10.450
Just what I thought.

878
01:17:29.075 --> 01:17:31.117
Mamma Mia!

879
01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:33.825
That's why the
Super Mario Brothers are here.

880
01:17:33.867 --> 01:17:35.284
Out to save Brooklyn...

881
01:17:35.325 --> 01:17:36.367
Save Brooklyn...

882
01:17:36.367 --> 01:17:37.159
Brooklyn...

883
01:17:37.159 --> 01:17:38.367
Save Brooklyn...

884
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:58.242
Let's-a go.

885
01:18:03.784 --> 01:18:04.784
Hey!

886
01:18:05.825 --> 01:18:07.325
Leave him alone.

887
01:18:08.075 --> 01:18:09.617
Mario...

888
01:18:10.659 --> 01:18:12.575
You just don't know when you quit.

889
01:18:13.159 --> 01:18:14.034
Yeah...

890
01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:15.492
I've been told that before.

891
01:18:19.325 --> 01:18:20.200
Mario!

892
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.409
The Star!

893
01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:26.200
No!

894
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.325
That's mine!

895
01:18:47.867 --> 01:18:48.617
Lou...

896
01:18:51.034 --> 01:18:53.825
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together.

897
01:19:04.534 --> 01:19:05.700
No!

898
01:19:27.117 --> 01:19:29.159
Rip 'em to pieces!

899
01:19:41.159 --> 01:19:42.825
Oh, hey, Spike.

900
01:19:42.867 --> 01:19:43.784
Luigi?!

901
01:20:01.658 --> 01:20:03.200
Mamma Mia.

902
01:20:54.242 --> 01:20:55.158
Peaches...

903
01:20:56.992 --> 01:20:58.533
Listen, this is not the way I pictured it,

904
01:20:58.575 --> 01:21:00.283
but give me one more chance.

905
01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.450
Ew, no.

906
01:21:02.492 --> 01:21:03.867
No, no, no, no.

907
01:21:05.325 --> 01:21:06.242
Hey...

908
01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:06.950
Hey!

909
01:21:06.992 --> 01:21:08.450
That is not cool!

910
01:21:08.742 --> 01:21:10.783
Ah, he got the blue mushroom!

911
01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:11.575
See...

912
01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.158
Told you, I'd get you a pet turtle.

913
01:21:14.033 --> 01:21:16.117
Not bad, mustache.

914
01:21:16.533 --> 01:21:19.325
And Luigi,
you're so brave.

915
01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:20.658
Oh, thanks.

916
01:21:20.658 --> 01:21:22.283
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

917
01:21:22.283 --> 01:21:24.033
Ah, my boys!

918
01:21:24.075 --> 01:21:26.950
- My heroes!
- Wahoo!

919
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:27.825
Mario...

920
01:21:27.867 --> 01:21:29.283
You were amazing!

921
01:21:30.825 --> 01:21:32.450
Thanks, dad.

922
01:21:33.117 --> 01:21:36.033
Ah, bring it in!

923
01:21:41.617 --> 01:21:46.700
Let's hear it, for
the Super Mario Brothers!

924
01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:56.867
These are my boys!

925
01:21:56.908 --> 01:21:58.867
Ha-hey!

926
01:21:59.408 --> 01:22:01.033
Wahoo!

927
01:22:04.492 --> 01:22:05.700
- Hey!
- Hey!

928
01:22:08.867 --> 01:22:11.700
BROOKLYN SAVED

929
01:22:38.283 --> 01:22:40.117
- Morning!
- Hello!

930
01:23:04.075 --> 01:23:05.908
Now, that's a happy ending.

931
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:07.325
Or is it?

932
01:23:07.325 --> 01:23:09.283
Because everything's over now.

933
01:23:09.283 --> 01:23:13.950
And all that's left is you
