04:34.440 --> 04:38.001
Sonny's sleeping right now. Perhaps
you can come back after a little while.

04:38.077 --> 04:41.945

- I did.

<i>I hoped that they
could find you.</i>

05:49.849 --> 05:53.341

It's the least I can do.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.554
- Oh! Sonny!
- God, my legs are so weak.

<i>What are you doing?</i>

08:30.810 --> 08:32.778
Um...

08:32.845 --> 08:35.336
Yeah, I just saw this,
uh, you know, yearbook,

08:35.448 --> 08:38.110
and Sonny and I
went to school together.

08:38.183 --> 08:42.280
<i>I admit I don't fully understand the
extent of your relationship with Sonny,</i>

Sonny seemed quite pleased at
being able to track you down.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.294
How exactly is it
you two know each other?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.226
Well, we're old friends.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.630
Um, we were boyfriend and
girlfriend in high school.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.533
Haven't seen each
other in a long time.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.505
Why not?

09:35.007 --> 09:37.999
Well, it, uh,
didn't end very well.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.069
Young love never
does, Don.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.844
You attended high
school at Winston Framer?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.480

Don,

10:19.118 --> 10:21.518
Sonny doesn't have
much time left.

10:23.689 --> 10:28.285
I’ve learned to love her like a
daughter since I moved in here.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.297
I don't want you
to hurt her in any way.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.297
Oh, no.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.859
No, I would
never hurt her.

I want to spend the rest
of my very short life

11:19.845 --> 11:24.179
with you. And I know
it sounds crazy,

11:24.250 --> 11:27.913
and I completely understand if you don't
want to do it or if you can't do it.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.581
But I need you.

11:30.656 --> 11:34.786
I’ve spent the last
25 years of my life

<i>I’ve known it
every single day.</i>

That's been a little
bit of a problem.

Oh, how are you
feeling, Sonny?

12:00.352 --> 12:03.788
Oh, I'm... I'm good,
considering.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.051
Dr. Pryce, may I get you
something to drink?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.854
A glass of water
would be great.

12:09.028 --> 12:12.193
- Hi.
- Hello.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.867
Oh.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.743

<i>Again.</i>

Deep.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.438
Oh, good.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.110
<i>Your, uh, lungs
seem fine.</i>

Have you had any more
sudden pain? Headaches?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.455
<i>Her legs collapsed today.</i>

13:13.526 --> 13:16.893
Well, yeah. Other than that,
I’ve been feeling fine.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.522
Well, Sonny, I think you
should be using a cane now.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.793
I know you're stubborn
about these things...

13:21.867 --> 13:26.236
No, I... I don't think I need a
cane. I mean, at least not yet.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.136
<i>I think it's
the right thing.</i>

13:28.207 --> 13:32.303
Doctor, is it going
to be more than a month?

13:32.378 --> 13:34.903
Until you can't
walk at all?

13:34.980 --> 13:38.211
No. No, no, no, that's
not what I’m asking.

13:38.284 --> 13:42.050
You... you seem to be, um,
feeling better than you could be,

13:42.121 --> 13:46.080
but these
illnesses, uh,

13:46.158 --> 13:49.992
can, uh, progress quickly,
uh, towards the end.

13:50.062 --> 13:53.759
Marie will keep me posted,
and we'll do everything we can

13:53.833 --> 13:58.099
to make this as easy
as it can be.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.674
Hello. I’m, uh,
Dr. Lance Pryce.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.232
Uh, Don McKay.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.939
You're an old
friend of Sonny's.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.278
I am, but how
did you know?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.511
Sonny told me she
was having a guest.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.747
<i>Well, I said that I was hoping
that I would have a guest.</i>

14:16.822 --> 14:19.256
Well, I’m glad
you're here.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.123
How long you in town?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.628
Well, I... I’m not sure.

14:24.697 --> 14:29.259
<i>Uh, you know, just
here for Sonny... sir.</i>

14:31.837 --> 14:35.295
<i>Well, I hope this doesn't
make you feel uncomfortable.</i>

14:35.374 --> 14:40.209
I was gonna put you in the guest room,
but, um, Marie's in there. So, is this okay?

14:40.279 --> 14:42.703
Yeah.
Oh, good.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.820
<i>She's been wonderful, Marie.
She's really wonderful.</i>

14:48.888 --> 14:53.052
I mean, she seems to
really care a lot about you.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.821
Is she a nurse?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.386
Yeah. Who else
would she be?

14:58.464 --> 14:59.988
<i>She's a blessing.</i>

15:00.065 --> 15:01.828
Mm.

15:04.003 --> 15:08.167
You know, when... when this
was your parents' room,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.209
the bed was against
that wall, wasn't it?

15:12.678 --> 15:14.703
God, it's been
such a long time.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.015
Do they still
live here?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.144
Oh, no.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.587
They died.
They're dead.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.887
Gosh.

15:26.992 --> 15:30.484
There was a carbon monoxide leak
in the house when they were asleep.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.027
- In this house?
- Yeah.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.728
- Were you here?
- No. God, no.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.861
No, I’d
been gone for years.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.373
So they left me
the house in their will.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.775
I was gonna sell it, but then I
thought, well, be nice gesture to them,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.870
and reminds me of them.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.212
That's sweet.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.247
Did you ever

15:57.623 --> 15:59.557
end up getting married?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.684
Hm-mm. No.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.695
<i>I could never
find love after you.</i>

16:04.763 --> 16:09.796
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

16:09.868 --> 16:12.393
Isn't that what
you wanna hear?

16:12.471 --> 16:15.463
Well, if it's the truth.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.806
Well, it can be if
you want it to be.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.141
<i>Do you want it to be?</i>

16:22.815 --> 16:27.550
- Yeah.
- Well, then it is.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.315
[whispers]
I think you're handsome.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.071
Sonny?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.214

17:50.636 --> 17:52.228
Sonny?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.042

18:32.111 --> 18:33.373
God!

18:41.954 --> 18:45.185
Oh, jeez, I didn't mean to
startle you. Is, uh, Sonny here?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.526
Um, no.

18:49.595 --> 18:53.793
Uh, Dr. Pryce, do you know
anything about bee stings?

18:53.899 --> 18:55.890
Uh, allergic reactions?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.732
Of course I do. How'd
you sleep last night?

18:58.804 --> 19:01.398
Fine.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.034
Well, it was cold, that's why I ask.
I know the heat is broken down here,

19:05.110 --> 19:09.240
and I was just curious if
you were able to handle it.

19:09.314 --> 19:14.047
I hate cold nights. I can never
sleep when the heat doesn't work.

19:14.119 --> 19:18.078
Well, I... I appreciate
your concern, but,

19:18.157 --> 19:23.220
honestly, I slept
upstairs, you know,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.755
with Sonny.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.062
You little cock sucker.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.829
Pardon me?

19:30.903 --> 19:33.565
You piece of shit.

19:33.639 --> 19:38.406
I’m gonna kill you,
you fuckin' weasel!

19:39.611 --> 19:42.171
Stop it!
Dr. Pryce?

19:43.415 --> 19:44.677
Fuckin' weasel.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.286
I’m gonna kill you!

19:48.353 --> 19:51.288
Die! Die! Die!

19:51.356 --> 19:52.846
Die!

19:52.925 --> 19:54.916
No!

20:01.033 --> 20:03.024
Die!

Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:05.330 --> 21:06.490
Stop.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.015
Oh, shit!

21:32.357 --> 21:35.849
[pants and grunts]

21:55.647 --> 21:58.411
Alright, I’ve got it.
I’ve got it. I’ve got it.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.460
Home sweet home.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.971
<i>Don, what's wrong?</i>

22:57.042 --> 22:59.169
<i>Don?</i>

<i>[monitor beeping]</i>

23:18.830 --> 23:20.798
Where am I?

23:20.866 --> 23:23.130
You're in the hospital.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.897
You had an allergic
reaction to a bee sting.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.405
How's Dr. Pryce?

23:28.473 --> 23:31.237
Um, well, I just
spoke to him.

23:31.343 --> 23:35.837
He's very concerned about you,
and he said to give you his best.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.978
You spoke to him?

23:39.050 --> 23:42.178
I was so worried I was
gonna lose you today.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.148
Uh, what happened to him?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.687
Don?

23:50.762 --> 23:54.323
Will you marry me?

23:54.399 --> 23:59.359
I’m sorry, uh... Did... did you
talk to Dr. Pryce on the phone?

24:00.772 --> 24:02.933
Did you hear
what I just said?

24:03.041 --> 24:07.944
I wanna be married to you
at the end of my life.

24:09.047 --> 24:11.447
You're serious.

24:11.516 --> 24:14.883
I thought you were
gonna die today.

24:14.953 --> 24:19.049
And all I could keep thinking when I
saw you lying on the floor, bleeding...

24:19.124 --> 24:20.614
I had a nosebleed.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.559
This is a wonderful man.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.961
This is a man
of pure good.

24:27.032 --> 24:31.230
And a man that I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.067
As short as
that may be.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.968
Don McKay.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.413
You feeling all right?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.886
You mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

24:49.955 --> 24:51.582
Um, no, I don't mind.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.591
First time you've been
back in a while, huh?

24:56.261 --> 24:58.252
Yes.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.659
<i>- How long is it been?
- Since I was 18.</i>

25:05.437 --> 25:07.496
What's your business
here right now?

25:07.606 --> 25:10.905
I’m sorry, but Don needs to get
his rest. You'll have to leave.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.604
What did you say
your name was?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.339
God!

25:15.447 --> 25:18.439
Copy that. So, um, how
long you in town for?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.850
I don't know. It's, uh...

25:22.354 --> 25:24.015
I gotta get out
of the hospital.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.455
<i>Okay, well you
have a nice visit.</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:29.653
And keep your nose
clean, Don McKay.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.499
What was that
all about?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.433
<i>(Sonny)
Are you okay?</i>

25:41.506 --> 25:43.201
I feel pretty
good, yeah.

25:43.308 --> 25:47.269
- I want you to sit down on the sofa.
- Okay.

25:47.345 --> 25:51.611
- I’m gonna get you a glass of water.
- Thank you. Thank you.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.556
<i>Here you go.</i>

26:01.626 --> 26:04.718
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.501
Um, so, the, uh,

26:12.571 --> 26:15.836
these pictures, they... it's...

26:15.907 --> 26:19.172
it's like it's two.
They're very peculiar.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.144
Oh, my God,
I just forgot.

26:21.212 --> 26:24.238
The nurse gave this to me
when you are unconscious.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.579
It's called an
epinephrine pen.

26:26.651 --> 26:30.314
And if you ever get stung by a bee
again, you stab it into your thigh.

26:30.388 --> 26:33.916
- Really, it could save your life.
- Thank you.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.161
[clears throat]

26:40.565 --> 26:44.001
Is that some
sort of art?

26:44.069 --> 26:47.266
What are you asking? I mean,
are you accusing me of something?

26:47.339 --> 26:51.605
No. No, I was just
curious, because it's...

26:51.710 --> 26:53.871
Don, I was married.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.879
Are you happy?

26:57.682 --> 26:59.445
I... what are you
talking about?

26:59.517 --> 27:02.384
I am talking about the
fact that I was married!

27:04.923 --> 27:06.618
Married? When?

27:06.691 --> 27:10.388
It was a long time ago.
He's such a bastard.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.863
<i>After he left, I cut him
out of all the pictures.</i>

27:13.932 --> 27:17.868
I should have told you. I’m
sorry. I was just so embarrassed.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.029
I’m sorry.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.804
Does he know
you're dying?

27:22.874 --> 27:25.875
- He's dead.
- He's dead, too?

27:25.944 --> 27:27.912
Hm. I’m sorry.

27:27.979 --> 27:31.471
You don't have to be sorry.
That guy got what he deserved.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.916
Oh, that is a terrible
thing to say. But it's true.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.555
He was such a bad man.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.592
You're such a good man.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.287
I’m so lucky
I found you.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.606
[whispers] I think this
might be a little rude.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.939
She'll live. I won't.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.670
I want you to
take me upstairs.

28:03.782 --> 28:06.844
- Really?
- Yeah. Right now.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.784
Ow! Oh, my God!
Ow. Ow.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.627
- Oh, God, my back.
- Are you okay?

28:16.695 --> 28:19.027
I think the disease
is spreading.

28:19.097 --> 28:20.928
To your back?
What can I do?

28:20.999 --> 28:24.968
- I want you to lie down next to me.
- Okay.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.266
Will you hold me?

28:27.338 --> 28:29.169
Okay.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.483
Um,

28:39.551 --> 28:42.315
my bladder's full, and
I have to go upstairs.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.221
I wanna lie on the floor
with you like we used to.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.054
[whispers]
Okay.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.888
But I really need to pee.
I'll... I'll be right back.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.330
All right, go.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.164
You'll be okay?

28:58.236 --> 29:00.227
Take your epinephrine
pen. Just in case.

29:00.305 --> 29:02.364
I got it. Thanks.

You told me you were
gonna get a sandwich.

How have you been? Do you
still have the tire shop?

31:33.825 --> 31:36.385
<i>Oh, no, no, no. I, uh, I
sold it about two years ago.</i>

days, I’m actually here.

No shit! You're here?

<i>I was wondering, If you're not too

How long you gonna be?

Oh. You care to help
with the gardening?

32:24.442 --> 32:28.709
- No, I, uh...
- Of course not.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.546
Besides, I think you've already spilled
enough seed in the house already.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.877
<i>I don't suppose I
could borrow your car.</i>

32:36.955 --> 32:39.116
You're right
about that.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.385
That's what I thought.

32:41.459 --> 32:45.190
But I can take you someplace if it's
not too far. I could use a break.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.561
Really?

32:47.632 --> 32:50.066
Really.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.244
<i>Marie, do you
enjoy gardening?</i>

33:05.316 --> 33:08.308
Gardening was my
mother's favorite hobby.

33:08.419 --> 33:11.252
At least that's
what my father says.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.257
I never actually
mattered, myself.

33:16.794 --> 33:18.728
It's very therapeutic.

33:18.796 --> 33:21.765
I know many love
to garden, men even.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.330
Dr. Lance Pryce, in fact,

33:26.437 --> 33:28.837
loves to garden.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.292
Marie, did you happen to
know Sonny's ex-husband?

33:52.263 --> 33:54.595
Ex-husband?

33:54.665 --> 33:58.533
Sonny was never married.
At least she never told me.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.947
Thank you.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.880
How are you
gonna get back?

34:12.984 --> 34:16.215
Um, I’ll find
way. Don't worry.

34:40.645 --> 34:43.739
<i>Hey I
[laughs]</i>

34:43.815 --> 34:46.409
I’ll be damned. I never
thought I’d see it.

The day Donny Mac
came home.

34:49.487 --> 34:53.184
Oh, man.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.987
<i>Hey, sorry Don, but, uh, these days
you never know who's out to get you.</i>

34:57.061 --> 34:59.757
Good to see you, man.
Come on in.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.823
- Good to see you, Otis.
- Come on in.

35:04.402 --> 35:08.031
Man! It’s exactly
like I remember.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.664
[chuckles]

35:09.740 --> 35:11.708
Look at this.

35:15.546 --> 35:19.683
<i>- Where'd you get that jukebox?
- Well, you know me, I have my ways.</i>

35:19.750 --> 35:23.846
But the motherfucker only plays one song,
so it's not entirely a win-win situation.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.355
But, it's a good
song, at least.

35:26.424 --> 35:28.892
<i>[loud music playing]</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:33.363
Sorry about that! There are times I could
just look at this thing and it goes off.

35:34.966 --> 35:38.800
I think it must be
haunted or something.

Of course.</i>

36:10.768 --> 36:13.931
Last time I saw you, you were
pretty heartbroken over that girl.

Yes and no. It...

36:26.317 --> 36:29.343
and threw his body in the
woods behind Sonny's house.

36:29.420 --> 36:32.981
[laughs]

36:37.028 --> 36:39.929
What the fuck were you
doing behind Sonny's house?

36:39.997 --> 36:43.125
<i>Why you tellin' this to me? Is
this what you came here to tell me?</i>

36:43.201 --> 36:45.635
Because if it is, you
can get out of my house.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.295
But something's not right!

36:47.371 --> 36:49.965
You're damn right,
it's not right!

36:50.041 --> 36:51.838
I’m sorry,
but it's the truth.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.935
<i>I don't give a rat's
dick how sorry you are.</i>

36:55.012 --> 36:58.106
The point is you should have never
brought that shit into my house.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.548
You don't know me
that well anymore.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.643
It was self-defense.
It was a crime of passion.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.620
Were you fuckin' him
before killed him?

37:04.689 --> 37:07.351
A crime of passion for him!
You've gotta believe that.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.892
I don't have
to believe shit!

37:14.565 --> 37:16.089
Who else have
you told this to?

37:16.167 --> 37:19.625
Nobody. There's nobody
else I can trust.

37:19.704 --> 37:23.333
<i>Why you trust me? I mean, you don't know
the first thing about me! Not anymore!</i>

37:23.407 --> 37:27.741
<i>You gave up knowing
me decades ago.</i>

37:27.812 --> 37:29.336
I know you're
a good man, Otis.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.007
Oh, you don't
know anything!

37:33.818 --> 37:36.912
I’m sorry I brought
this into your house.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.253
It's good seeing you.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.357
<i>If it was self-defense,</i>

37:44.428 --> 37:47.591
you did nothin' wrong.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.929
<i>Why don't you
just tell the cops?</i>

37:50.034 --> 37:52.195
You know why.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.332
Donny, you walk into
my house after decades,

37:57.408 --> 38:00.673
and you tell me that you've murdered
someone, and you need my help,

38:00.745 --> 38:03.509
<i>presumably with
the dead body I</i>

38:08.886 --> 38:10.854
What do you need from me?

38:12.890 --> 38:15.518
Help me with
the dead body.

38:26.537 --> 38:27.629
Thank you.

38:27.705 --> 38:28.899
Don't thank me, yet.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.066
Hello there, Don.

38:40.451 --> 38:43.419
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.787
Midnight.

38:57.435 --> 39:01.132
My boy used to play in that tree
house. The one that burned down.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.265
Real pity what
happened down there.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.005
Poor families.

39:08.112 --> 39:11.138
Can you imagine, McKay?

39:14.251 --> 39:17.778
It is you, isn't it?

39:17.855 --> 39:19.982
You're Don McKay.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.989
Don McKay, right in my cab.
Who would have thunk it?

39:39.477 --> 39:42.378
Jesus Christ. Come on!

39:42.446 --> 39:45.040
<i>Answer the phone!</i>

39:45.116 --> 39:47.812
Pick up the phone. Argh.

39:50.187 --> 39:51.848
Come on!

39:55.359 --> 39:58.192
How long have you
been standing there?

40:00.231 --> 40:01.960
Who were you
on the phone with?

40:02.032 --> 40:05.001
Oh. That was Dr. Pryce.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.333
He's very
concerned about you.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.669
Is he?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.799
What's going
on here, Sonny?

40:11.876 --> 40:13.309
What do you mean?

40:13.377 --> 40:16.642
Where is doctor Pryce?

40:16.714 --> 40:19.581
He's at the hospital.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.083
<i>He just asked about you.</i>

40:22.153 --> 40:25.589
<i>Do you want some tea?</i>

40:25.656 --> 40:27.681
No, thank you.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.594
What's wrong?

40:32.730 --> 40:35.028
You're so serious.

40:40.538 --> 40:43.029
Why won't you kiss me?

40:43.107 --> 40:46.440
Did I do something wrong?

40:46.544 --> 40:48.102
I don't know.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.941
Bullshit!

40:50.014 --> 40:53.211
Did you?

40:53.284 --> 40:56.515
Fuck you for coming in here
when I’m sick, and I’m dying!

40:58.355 --> 41:00.220
I’m sorry.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.782
I... I didn't mean
to upset you.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.691
You have to stay calm.

41:04.762 --> 41:09.199
You calm down! I’m the one
who's fucking dying here.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.928
Sonny, I don't think
this is right.

41:13.604 --> 41:16.630
<i>Get out I Get out.</i>

41:17.908 --> 41:19.637
<i>Get out of my housel</i>

41:36.327 --> 41:38.557
Don, I’m sorry!

41:38.629 --> 41:42.087
I’m sorry! I didn't
mean it! Please, come back!

41:43.934 --> 41:45.993
Please!

41:46.070 --> 41:49.938
I’m really sorry that
I’ve been acting so crazy.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.600
It's just that...

41:53.677 --> 41:58.080
Dr. Pryce is very jealous
about you being here

41:58.148 --> 42:02.448
because he's had feelings
for me for a really long time.

42:03.921 --> 42:08.848
- Oh. Have you ever been with him?
- No, he's my doctor.

42:08.959 --> 42:11.928
No, he... God.

42:11.996 --> 42:15.454
He's been with me from the
beginning of my sickness.

42:15.533 --> 42:20.470
But he told me
that he loves me.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.631
But I told him
that I love you.

42:22.706 --> 42:27.200
And then, oh, he just got crazy,
and I got so overwhelmed, and...

42:28.679 --> 42:30.977
Will you please stay?

42:31.048 --> 42:33.983
When is the last time you saw
Dr. Pryce? Do you remember?

42:34.051 --> 42:36.781
Why do you care so
much about Dr. Pryce?

42:36.854 --> 42:40.551
You don't have
to worry. Please stay.

42:40.658 --> 42:44.388
- All right, I’ll stay.
- Thank you.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.952
I wanted to anyway.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.406
I’m almost ready.

43:03.514 --> 43:07.974
I’m so sorry for the way I acted
before. That was so embarrassing.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.917
It's alright.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.755
Why are you
looking at me?

43:18.862 --> 43:22.161
You're so beautiful.

43:22.232 --> 43:25.360
At least I’ll look good
in the open casket.

43:31.842 --> 43:34.208
So, Marie, we'll be back in a few hours.

43:34.278 --> 43:38.271
Try not to be too late. Dr. Pryce is
coming by in the morning for a house call.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.883
Did she hear me?

43:40.951 --> 43:42.885
Um, I’ll make
sure she knows.

43:42.953 --> 43:45.547
You do that, Don.

43:45.889 --> 43:49.552
Oh, and Don. Found a
shirt of yours today.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.726
I tried to wash it, but some of
the stains seemed pretty permanent.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.891
<i>Had to throw it out.</i>

43:56.967 --> 43:58.901
But I tried, hm?

43:58.969 --> 44:02.803
<i>I mean, it's the thought
that counts, right?</i>

44:02.873 --> 44:06.570
Yes, the thought.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.202
Goodnight.

44:09.446 --> 44:11.539
Night night!

44:11.982 --> 44:14.974
Wow, this... this
is a nice place.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.546
I’m really glad
that we came here.

44:18.622 --> 44:20.920
Yeah, me, too.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.482
Thank you so much.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.132
I never stopped
thinking about you.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.001
Never.

44:34.071 --> 44:35.663
Me, neither.

44:35.739 --> 44:37.798
God.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.841
You read all
of my letters?

44:41.912 --> 44:45.109
Yeah, every single
one of them.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.013
More times
than you know.

44:49.019 --> 44:51.283
How come you
never wrote back?

44:51.355 --> 44:54.620
Well, your letters
were so explicit.

44:54.692 --> 44:58.628
I felt like I really didn't miss
out on anything in your life.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.256
It was kind of like I was
watching you from a far,

45:01.331 --> 45:04.858
<i>without being there
to hurt you anymore.</i>

45:04.935 --> 45:08.701
That's why I didn't write you back,
because I didn't wanna mess everything up,

45:08.772 --> 45:10.967
And then, God, what if
you didn't write to me?

45:11.041 --> 45:13.942
I’d lose the only part
of you that I had left.

45:21.785 --> 45:25.812
<i>I must have gotten a letter from you
every single year for the last 20.</i>

45:25.889 --> 45:27.652
Twenty-five.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.159
Wow, 25.

45:30.227 --> 45:33.993
To be quite honest, I never
expected to get anything in return.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.498
I wanna get
married next week.

45:45.909 --> 45:48.173
Who was that girl?

45:48.245 --> 45:52.238
You know the one that looked like an
80-year old man? What was her name?

45:52.316 --> 45:54.580
Um, Sally Boyd.

45:54.651 --> 45:58.348
Yes. I did not like her.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.185
I always thought
you liked her.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.522
Well, you thought wrong.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.494
I hated her.

46:05.562 --> 46:09.259
Hate. That's
a strong word.

46:09.333 --> 46:12.097
Make a right. We're gonna
take a shortcut. That way.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.729
But you... you indicated
a left, but we'll go right.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.500
God, your laugh is
so different now.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.411
What do you mean?

46:22.513 --> 46:24.606
It’s just, you used
to laugh like a,

46:24.681 --> 46:27.047
like a, um,
a happy bird.

46:27.117 --> 46:31.110
It was just the death of me.
I like your new laugh, too.

46:31.221 --> 46:34.281
My new laugh.

46:34.358 --> 46:38.795
Oh. My new laugh is gonna
have to be the death of you.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.266
I don't feel so good.

46:52.075 --> 46:53.804
Are you okay?

46:53.911 --> 46:56.209
Oh, what are
you looking at?

46:57.781 --> 46:59.874
A very beautiful woman.

47:01.118 --> 47:03.552
Come to bed.

47:03.620 --> 47:05.918
I have to take
a shower.

47:05.989 --> 47:09.982
You just took a
shower before dinner.

47:10.093 --> 47:12.425
Yeah, well, I feel dirty.

47:12.496 --> 47:15.761
I’ll get cleaned up.

47:15.833 --> 47:19.496
If you come to bed, I’ll make
sure that you need a shower.

47:19.570 --> 47:22.835
Uh-huh. Why don't
you get some rest?

47:22.906 --> 47:25.568
You need your
sleep. Okay?

47:25.642 --> 47:27.576
Okay.

47:41.258 --> 47:43.089
<i>[door closes]</i>

48:07.718 --> 48:10.812
<i>Otis? I really
appreciate this, man.</i>

48:10.888 --> 48:14.380
If it weren't for old times sake,
you would have nothin' to appreciate.

48:14.491 --> 48:18.951
Okay, like, what you're
gonna see is truly horrible.

48:19.029 --> 48:22.055
I don't want you to think
that I’m a monster or anything.

48:22.165 --> 48:24.827
I’m not asking
you any questions.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.962
<i>I don't wanna know why you have
somebody burled in Sonny's yard.</i>

48:28.038 --> 48:31.007
I just wanna grab that body, put
him in my truck, and burn him.

48:31.074 --> 48:34.407
<i>After that, I never wanna see
your ass again. You understand me?</i>

48:34.478 --> 48:36.503
Yes. I do.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.071
<i>[dog barks at a distance]</i>

48:44.421 --> 48:47.254
<i>What the fuck are you doing?
You don't have a flashlight?</i>

48:47.324 --> 48:48.916
No.

48:49.026 --> 48:51.358
There's gotta be a
flashlight in the house.

48:51.428 --> 48:54.488
It’s too risky to go rooting
around for one in the house.

48:54.564 --> 48:56.327
Then what do
you wanna do?

48:56.400 --> 48:59.369
Well, have your eyes
adjusted at all?

48:59.436 --> 49:01.233
<i>What do you think?</i>

49:03.040 --> 49:06.009
I left him somewhere
in this vicinity. Okay?

49:06.076 --> 49:07.703
Are you serious?

49:07.778 --> 49:10.338
I can't wait to get
the body, okay?

49:10.414 --> 49:12.507
Because if I do, he's
gonna start to stink.

49:12.582 --> 49:15.551
And if I get caught doing
something suspicious in this town,

49:15.619 --> 49:18.679
<i>they're gonna put me away
forever. Now, just help me.</i>

49:21.892 --> 49:24.452
We'll just have to feel
for him. You first.

49:24.561 --> 49:26.188
All right.

49:26.263 --> 49:28.731
<i>[owl hoots]</i>

49:31.301 --> 49:32.791
<i>Get anything?</i>

49:32.903 --> 49:34.598
No.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.901
- You see him?
- No.

49:40.377 --> 49:43.073
Do you see him?

49:43.146 --> 49:45.307
I feel something!

49:45.382 --> 49:47.873
No, it's just
a piece of wood.

49:47.951 --> 49:51.716
- Try a little further back.
- No, you try further back!

49:51.788 --> 49:53.415
<i>(Sonny) What is going on back here?</i>

49:53.490 --> 49:55.424
Don, I thought you
were taking a shower.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.484
I was.

49:58.562 --> 50:01.487
- Who the hell is he?
- Do you remember Otis?

50:01.565 --> 50:05.431
- I’m calling the Police.
- No, no, no, no. Don't call the Police.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.493
What are you doing?

50:07.604 --> 50:09.504
I... I left
something out here.

50:09.606 --> 50:10.937
What?

50:12.809 --> 50:14.674
<i>Something.</i>

50:20.317 --> 50:24.117
Don, you scared the hell out of me
back there! I thought you were robbers.

50:24.187 --> 50:28.419
If you thought we were robbers,
why did you come outside?

50:28.492 --> 50:31.359
Will you please
start explaining?

50:33.196 --> 50:36.461
Sonny, it... it's complicated.

50:36.533 --> 50:39.969
<i>I honestly, I don't know how
to explain it to you. I’m sorry.</i>

50:40.037 --> 50:42.301
Well, figure it out!

50:42.372 --> 50:43.930
You're too drunk.

50:44.007 --> 50:48.205
What the fuck are
you doing back there!

50:50.547 --> 50:52.640
Oh, God. No, no, no.
Don't look at that.

50:52.716 --> 50:55.048
<i>Give me the picture.</i>

50:55.118 --> 50:58.519
Oh, God, no.

51:00.023 --> 51:02.685
No. I’m sorry.

51:06.029 --> 51:08.489
- What are you doing?
- I can explain, I swear.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.226
You're lying to me.

51:10.333 --> 51:12.961
I know it seems that way,
but I swear I’m not.

51:13.036 --> 51:17.664
- Look at that!
- I can explain. I swear, I can explain.

51:17.741 --> 51:20.232
Forget it.

51:20.343 --> 51:22.140
Don!

51:35.225 --> 51:37.693
Don't go.

You know, I... I shouldn't

he asked that
I not tell you.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.295
And he's violent.

to protect you.

is he even

56:56.312 --> 56:59.748
Yes, God, of course he is. That's
why the whole thing is so difficult,

56:59.816 --> 57:03.183
Because on one hand, he's a such
an important part of my life,

57:03.253 --> 57:05.585

he's also my...

Do you know?

I don't know. I think he may
have run off or something.

57:31.047 --> 57:32.878
Maybe he was

57:32.949 --> 57:35.850
Please, stay with me.

it's still there.

Me, too.

She's acting
all deathly ill

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.596
so you would come
here and marry her.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.599
And then Lance was
gonna kill you.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.727
<i>And we were gonna

And then I found Lance's
body in the garden.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:15.353
And I knew he must
have gotten jealous

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:18.365
and gone crazy
and jumped the gun.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:21.459
And that's when you
must have killed him.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.528
Mm.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:27.303
And then I found your

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.277
It wasn't too difficult to
put two and two together.

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:37.982
But thank goodness you did
kill him! Don't you see?

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.488
You've given us
a way out of this.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.285

It's never gonna

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:48.496
Shut up!

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:51.795
If you can make Sonny think
you're still in the dark,

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.960
you can still marry her.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:57.403
<i>Then you collect the
inheritance, write me a check,</i>

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.906

of this ever happened.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:03.342
What, the two of you
come up with that?

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:05.846
You and Mel?

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.644
Mm-hm.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.913
Why do we need Sonny?
Why don't I just marry you?

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:14.581
[laughter]

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.850
Aren't you the
hopeless romantic?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.484
I’m married.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.859
Thanks for the offer.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.593
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:29.831
Lance Pryce is hanging on a
meat hook in a freezer right now.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.270
<i>If you don't
Like our offer,</i>

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:36.607
he goes right from the
freezer to the Police station,

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:40.203
<i>and your fingerprints
are all over him.</i>

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:45.514
I beg you, Don.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.749
Don't test me.

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.758
Mm.

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:02.028
<i>Why is she still pretending to
talk to Lance on the telephone?</i>

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.970
<i>Because she probably doesn't
want you to get suspicious.</i>

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:08.202
She has no idea Lance is dead.
For her, the plan is still intact.

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:11.804
<i>I was gonna go to Boston in
a few days and look for you.</i>

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:15.042
Sonny couldn't just
let sleeping dogs lie.

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.381
She had to write you
that second letter.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.581
<i>You know, Don, she is
a very selfish girl.</i>

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.555
<i>And how you
put up with her.</i>

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.957
All right, enough.
You, put this on.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.261
What is this?

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:31.060
It’s a wire.
Strap it on.

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:38.265
What exactly is it
you expect me to do?

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.104
Whatever it takes, but I
want you married by tomorrow.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.769
Marie, that's crazy.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.245
It is absolutely
not crazy.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.613
<i>She's wants to tie the knot as
much as you do. Don't forget that.</i>

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:53.121
If you let on to her anything,
the body goes to the Police.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:58.354
If you remove the wire,
the body goes to the Police.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.590
If you fuck us up in any way,
the body goes to the Police.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:05.031
I got it.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.592
I hope you do, Don. Because I wouldn't
want anything to happen to you.

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:44.733
Don! What the hell
is going on?

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.474
Well, what, uh,

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.479
what arewhat
are you doing?

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:54.516
I, uh, just took a roast out
of the freezer to defrost,

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:58.747
<i>and, um, I’m going
to curl my hair.</i>

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:02.348
<i>Why did you run out
Like that before?</i>

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.824
And who was
on the phone?

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:10.062
Um... Sonny?

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.862
I want you
to marry me. Tomorrow.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.269
- What?
- Today.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.498
So that we'll
be married tomorrow.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.703
<i>I love you.</i>

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.211
<i>Please?</i>

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.043
Oh.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:30.611
- Oh, I see.
- What do you see?

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:33.047
What did she say to you?

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:37.024
She? Uh, who, she?

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:40.220
You ran out of here like a
chicken with your head cut off.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:45.529
<i>Then you come running back two hours
later with an emergency marriage proposal?</i>

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.900
Don't you think I’d
be a little suspicious?

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.235
No. I...

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.468
I clearly love you,

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:57.478
<i>and I wanna commit.
Long term.</i>

01:11:57.546 --> 01:12:01.073
What did she
say to you?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:06.213
Well, she, she
didn't say anything.

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:09.155
<i>What do you say,
you wanna get married?</i>

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.418
<i>Let's just take
a chance on Life.</i>

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.933
What's?

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.094
You're wearing a wire?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.729
What do you say?
You wanna...

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.274
<i>She made you wear
a fucking wire?</i>

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.775
<i>[knocking at door]</i>

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:33.611
Thank you. You've
ruined my life.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.084
<i>You've ruined my life!</i>

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.080
Hello.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:44.023
Marie, what a pleasant
surprise. And who is this?

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.790
This is Mel. He's
my private dick.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:50.195
And why would you
need a private detective?

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.631
I’m not sure if
I can trust you.

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:56.467
Well, isn't that nice.
Well, come on in.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.815
<i>[thumping]</i>

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.852
<i>(Samuel)
Open up! Don!</i>

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.317
<i>Open up!
[thumping]</i>

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:20.794
<i>Don I Help me!</i>

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:24.055
- Let's settle this now.
- Settle what?

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.896
Enough of these games! We'll
split the inheritance three ways.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:29.994
You, me and Mel,
and Don.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:33.337
<i>No. Don, what
did she tell you?</i>

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.139
Well, basically that
you wanted to marry me

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:40.739
and then kill me for my
inheritance, which doesn't exist!

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.977
She's lying!

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.645
<i>I am not lying I They were
gonna kill you for that money.</i>

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.985
<i>You have no money. Nobody
is trying to kill you.</i>

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:49.921
Don't listen to her!

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.516
You apparently already had
your turn! Now it is mine!

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:56.257
Don, listen to me. Lance lost
his job at the fire house.

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.697
Dr. Pryce is
a fireman?

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:02.203
We needed the extra money, so we rented
out our guest room out to Marie here,

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:05.763
Everything was fine, until one day she
walked in on me reading your letters!

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.434
<i>She started acting strange
and a Little obsessed.</i>

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:11.536
You're crazy! They rented me
a room, Don, that much is true.

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:15.515
She threatened to blackmail me! She was gonna
show Lance the letters you had written to me.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:19.213
<i>You know how crazy he is. He's jealous,
and he would've killed me, and she knew it.</i>

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.756
How can you make up
so much up so quickly?

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:25.384
I didn't have any money to give her, so I
had to make up a story about inheritance.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.860
I know it sounds crazy.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:29.397
It does sound crazy.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.127
I didn't know what to do. She
made me write that first letter.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.725
You lying,
conniving maniac!

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.736
He doesn't have
any fuckin' inheritance!

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.568
So why the hell
did you tell us he did?

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.801
<i>Come on, Mel, let's
just get out of here.</i>

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:43.743
We'll find the money for the
place in Miami somehow else.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.576
<i>Please. These people are
fuckin' crazy. We don't...</i>

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:49.913
<i>(Mel)
Oh I Holy shit I</i>

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:54.822
<i>What the hell
did you do?</i>

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.916
- I need you to kill my husband.
- What?

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.723
Whatever she's paying you,
I’ll pay you double.

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.822
Your husband's already
dead, you crazy fuck!

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:07.097
- What?
- He's dead!

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.796
<i>How is he dead?</i>

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:12.434
Uh...

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.669
Don, you killed Lance?

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.767
Yeah, I did.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.904
You did?

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:22.781
Yes! He killed him! He's in the
fucking freezer on the porch!

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:29.018
The freezer.
I... I didn't, uh...

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.821
I didn't know he
was in the freezer.

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:40.093
Ninety-nine
Berry street.

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:43.626
A maniac just
tried to kill me.

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.367
He said he was
a private detective.

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:50.309
<i>he murdered my friend I Please, hurry I</i>

01:15:56.184 --> 01:16:00.314
<i>You did it.
You killed him.</i>

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.619
I love you.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.389
I was hoping that
you would kill him,

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:15.061
once you knew what
a terrible man he was.

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.071
And you loved
me that much.

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.232
I didn't know you would do it this soon.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.742
That's why I wrote you the
letter in the first place.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:25.007
I needed you
to kill my husband.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.843
Why?

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:31.249
Because I’m gonna
collect $200, 000,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.256
which is our $200, 000.

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:38.690
<i>What the fuck
is going on here?</i>

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.594
Oh, my God.
This is about Lance.

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.859
He's the one that
had the inheritance.

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.197
He was the one
with the inheritance.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.829
But he didn't even
know that he had it.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:53.705
<i>See, his mom was gonna give it to him
as a present for his 60th birthday.</i>

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:56.369
Why would you do
something like this?

01:16:56.445 --> 01:17:00.779
<i>Okay, I want the money. All of
it. Or I’m going to the cops.</i>

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:05.616
Kill him. Kill him now and
we'll blame it all on him.

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:08.713
<i>Then we'll spilt the money and
we'll forget anything ever happened.</i>

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.691
No! I’m not
gonna kill Mel.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.026
<i>You, kill him now.
We'll blame it all on him.</i>

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.196
Don't do it.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.464
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.540
Come on. You can do it.

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:28.098
Mel.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:31.407
<i>Don't even think about it. Time
out I You're not telling the truth.</i>

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.143
<i>How could you convince Lance
that you were gonna marry me</i>

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.151
if you were still
married to Lance?

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.813
I wasn't married to him,
'cause my divorce went through

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.549
the day before I sent you
that letter. I did lie to him.

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:46.583
<i>I told him I would remarry him after
it was all over. But it doesn't matter!</i>

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:51.599
Married or not, I am on the top
of his will! Do it! Kill him!

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.430
No.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.939
<i>All right, Mel,
we'll just figure...</i>

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.771
Enough already.
Take a stand! Do it!

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:05.006
<i>No! Now come
on, Don, no.</i>

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:10.949
Listen, I’m not going to do
anything. It's only money, man.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.010
He only wants
the money. Kill him.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:16.455
<i>Put the fucking
ax down, okay?</i>

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:21.758
Or fucking hit her with it. No!
Give it to me, I’ll fucking kill her.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.128
I’m not gonna kill
anybody with an ax.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:26.030
- Goddammit.
- Mel?

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:29.696
You shouldn't kill
anyone with an ax either.

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.432
Mel!

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:35.042
Mel! Stop!

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:58.622
Okay!

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.403
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.167
You beat Mel to death.

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.573
I did it for us.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.501
There's no us.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:27.426
I don't even
know who you are.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.862
<i>But I know you're
not Sonny Ross.</i>

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.899
What do you mean?

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.695
She's dead.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:40.765
<i>She's been dead for 25
years because I killed her,</i>

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:44.107
in an accident.
I n a fire,

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:47.114
<i>with two other of
my best friends.</i>

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:49.742
And I lived.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.445
God.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:57.720
You sure keep a lot
under that uniform.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.294
And that's why I wrote
those stupid letters.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:09.733
Those letters.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.399
<i>I found them the day that
I moved into the house.</i>

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.408
They were
in the closet.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:17.536
When they kept
coming year after year,

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:22.413
I knew that you thought
she still lived here.

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:26.414
I guess I
thought I knew.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:29.480
And you want
to pretend to be her.

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.659
<i>And I let you.</i>

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:36.254
How did I know that I was
gonna fall in love with you?

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.231
I don't even
know your name.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.097
It's Joanne.

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:43.433
You're never gonna
get away with this.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.439
Yeah, maybe.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.065
<i>[approaching sirens]</i>

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.339
But I can't, I can't
worry about that.

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:53.972
<i>[sirens]</i>

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.028
What's going on?

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.463
Go! Go, go,
go, go, go, go!

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.811
<i>Get the hands up! Freeze!</i>

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:30.477
<i>It's Like a fuckin'
slaughterhouse in here!</i>

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:33.612
Okay, ma'am, I need you
to come with me, ma'am.

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.386
<i>Its' all right, ma'am.
Let's go.</i>

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.557
Witness secure,
back of case.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.576
Two dead bodies,

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:03.914
beaten to death with
a goddamned frozen roast.

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.850
I didn't do it.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.515
Oh. I suppose
it was her.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.421
Joanne Bailey
did all this?

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.653
Do you want my story?

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:15.560
No. Save that
for your statement.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.363
Hey, who's in
charge of canine?

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.932
<i>(officer)
Okay, let's go, sir.</i>

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:31.274
<i>[thumping]
Let me out of here!</i>

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:32.870
You hear that?

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.007
Stay with him.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.711
<i>[thumping] Let me out of
here! Let me out of here!</i>

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.277
<i>Let me out I Come on I</i>

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.060
<i>What the hell took
you guys so long?</i>

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.560
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.460
I got a bunk ear.

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:50.793
Don!

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.457
<i>Take it easy, sir.</i>

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.899
What the hell's
going on here?

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:58.906
Samuel, just go with these police
officers, tell them everything you know.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.067
Why are you handcuffed?

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.542
What in the good lord's
name going on here?

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.636
It’s a long story.

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.238
What? What's that?

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:11.308
It’s a long story!
But you'll be fine.

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.551
<i>Let's take him in.</i>

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:18.751
Come with us, sir. Hey, hey, hey!
It’s all right! Come this way.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.260
All right.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:21.955
<i>We just wanna
talk to you.</i>

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:34.232
And?

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.842
I like that.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.578
And on account of the
damn cabby's recollection

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:46.347
and the recording we got from
that wire you were wearing,

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:50.619
we're not able to charge
you with anything right now.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.523
Bullshit policy.

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.619
For the record though,

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:58.530
I want you to know that I think
your cabby's a rotten apple.

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:01.124
And I think
you're one, too.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:04.968
And I’m gonna find a way
to pick you from your tree.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.203
I can guarantee
you that, McKay.

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:12.109
We found all your
letters at Joanne's house.

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:18.776
You got yourself into this mess
knowing she wasn't Sonny Ross?

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.947
You are one delusional,
crazy bastard.

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:24.787
I’m not crazy.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.124
<i>No? You're not?</i>

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.525
No.

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:36.635
I was just lonely.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:54.184
Well, I guess this is
the end of the line.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.917
Or the beginning,
I suppose.

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.918
Yeah.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.429
You gonna be all right?

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:05.523
I don't know.

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:08.829
If you ever
need anything...

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:11.701
I’ll call
the dispatcher.

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.506
This is my home phone.

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:19.376
If you ever need a place
to stay, or anything.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:22.712
I don't know how soon I’ll be
coming back this way, though, Samuel.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.582
Yeah. Don't blame you.

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:30.715
Well, it's been a
pleasure, Don McKay.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.386
That is, up until
the end there.

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.452
Yeah.

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.800
