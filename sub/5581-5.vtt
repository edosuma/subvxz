00:41.640 --> 00:43.750
- Shall I help?
- Well, you can.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.390
- You know what these
are, don't you? - No.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.380
- Pig boards. They control the pigs.
- (LAUGHS)

00:50.320 --> 00:52.750
Are you annoyed we've given
Yew Tree Farm to Mr Mason?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.550
I'm annoyed you fixed it
while I was in London,

00:55.600 --> 00:56.990
but no, he's a good man.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.910
And I hear pigs are his speciality.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.510
- No wonder you were convinced.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:01.560 --> 01:05.200
So now that you've settled in, have you
decided what your next task will be?

01:05.280 --> 01:08.720
You haven't done much about the repair shop
while I was away, so I'll start with that.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.200
I had an idea to put it on the edge of
the estate with access to the village.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.790
For passing trade?

01:13.840 --> 01:14.910
Why not?

01:14.960 --> 01:16.900
Is Papa ready for that?

01:17.080 --> 01:19.710
- Hmm. You must be gentle with him.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:19.760 --> 01:21.550
When does Mr Mason move in?

01:21.600 --> 01:22.870
His equipment's already there.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.750
And the Drewes leave on Wednesday,
so there's no point in waiting.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.510
And what about his old farm?

01:27.560 --> 01:29.710
Mr Henderson's taken over the land.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.710
He's going to move his uncle into
the house, much good may it do him.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.750
Nay. There's no need for bitterness now.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.270
Things have worked out well.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.310
- You're right.
- Oh, I tell you what.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.240
Why don't we go over on the day? We'll
take a picnic tea and lend him a hand.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.550
I could come, too. Another pair of hands.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.940
And very welcome, I have no doubt.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.740
- (LAUGHS)
- Good news?

01:50.800 --> 01:53.470
Oh, it's just a friend who's
going to be in London.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.470
- He wants to meet up.
- He?

01:55.520 --> 01:56.790
It's nothing like that.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.750
It's Bertie Pelham, the
agent from Brancaster Castle.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.910
I remember him. He shot with us.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.440
And he helped get the magazine
out during my night of terror.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.430
The Dowager Countess.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.310
Hello, Granny. What are you doing here?

02:09.360 --> 02:12.840
My dear. I am in need of a favour.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.270
Is Cora about?

02:15.320 --> 02:17.870
Er, no, she's got some
charity thing in the village.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.260
Oh, good.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.790
Why don't I like the sound of that?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.440
I'll leave you.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.160
The Minister of Health
is paying us a visit.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.110
Mr Chamberlain? I don't think so.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.440
Now, listen. He's on an
inspection tour of the north.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.870
He wants to see what's been
happening since the war.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.920
- Seems very sensible.
- And I want him to come here.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.640
I want him to listen to our arguments
against the York Hospital's plans.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.270
Mama, what is the point?

02:44.320 --> 02:46.070
Don't be jejune. You know very well,

02:46.120 --> 02:50.160
one word from Westminster and
the scheme would be abandoned.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.960
But why would he say the word, and
why would he ever come to Downton?

02:54.240 --> 02:58.760
You know, Neville Chamberlain's
wife was born Anne de Vere Cole.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.270
Guess who was her godfather.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.790
You guess for me.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.840
Your late papa, the
sixth Earl of Grantham.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.600
He and her father served in the
Crimea together when they were young.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.630
I have known her since she was born.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.550
I admit I am quite interested, but
when it comes to getting him here,

03:16.600 --> 03:20.280
I would say you have no more chance
than a cat in hell without claws.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.400
We'll see.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.760
Mr Carson has suggested we might
have dinner in our cottage tonight,

03:29.840 --> 03:31.710
so I thought I'd ask your advice.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.910
Oh, is this going to be a regular thing?

03:33.960 --> 03:36.190
I don't think so. Once in a while.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.430
Well, there's pate left
over and some chops.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.150
- I'll make up a basket.
- Would you?

03:40.200 --> 03:41.630
Oh, that would be so kind.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.150
When did you last cook?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.430
I've done the odd thing...

03:44.480 --> 03:47.840
Oh, well, of course, as we
all know, anyone can cook.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.600
Don't be like that. It's not my idea.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.790
But it might be nice.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.230
Mrs Patmore's just jealous.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.270
(LAUGHING) I'm sure she's not.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.860
But I would be grateful for the basket.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.030
Well, maybe I am.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.550
I nearly forgot. That chap, Henry...

04:04.600 --> 04:05.630
- Talbot?
- Exactly.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.310
Yes, he telephoned while you were out.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.870
He's going to be in Yorkshire on Wednesday

04:08.920 --> 04:11.830
to look at a car and he wants
you to watch him doing it.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.440
Hmm. To watch him looking at a car?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.519
Well, not quite. He's driving
it round some track nearby.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.870
- At Catterick.
- Testing it.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.269
Seeing how it handles.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.950
- I could take you, if you like.
- Would you?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.550
Well, I'd like to see it.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.950
- How about you?
- I'll be in London on Wednesday.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.030
Edith has a date.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.950
- No, I don't.
- Of course not.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.310
What do you mean, "Of course not"?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.510
Doctor Clarkson seems to be coming round.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.150
Isobel's bringing him for a
drink tonight with Dickie Merton.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.150
So that's why Mama paid her visit.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.510
When? What did she want?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.870
Neville Chamberlain is coming north.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.160
She wants him to dine here, so she
can convince him to support her.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.070
If he's on a tour, it'll be far
too late to alter his schedule.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.600
That's what I said, but she seems
to think she can persuade him.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.080
Is it wrong to hope she's mistaken?

04:56.680 --> 04:58.550
Anything interesting?

04:59.400 --> 05:03.760
It's Sergeant Willis saying he'll collect
me on Wednesday at nine, to go to York.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.380
For the trial.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.870
Would you like me to come, too?

05:07.920 --> 05:09.950
- Could you get the time off?
- Well, I could ask.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.910
You shouldn't have to
go to the trial alone.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.990
What trial?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.550
Miss Baxter has been called
to be a witness on Wednesday.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.870
I want to go along, keep her company.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.590
- I think you should.
- Mr Carson will understand.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.870
I'm only a character witness.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.150
Character witnesses can
make all the difference.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.750
Why do they want you to testify?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.510
There's a man being
tried for theft and I...

05:28.560 --> 05:29.830
I knew him once.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.030
Will your words affect the outcome?

05:32.080 --> 05:34.230
- Possibly.
- You must think about it carefully.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.380
She has thought about it,
Mr Bates. Very carefully.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.590
- Where were you?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Barrow.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.270
It was only coffee for the family,
so I thought Andy could manage.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.990
He could. But it's for me to say, not you.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.030
I'm going into the village in
a while. Do you want to come?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.590
Thanks, but no, thanks.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.030
I thought you needed some things.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.310
Nothing urgent.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.630
Right. Is that it?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.080
Er... Yes.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.510
I'm glad to see you here again, Dickie.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.070
Well, it's very good to be here, but
it's only about the row, I'm afraid.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.150
Oh, never mind that.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.710
We've brought Doctor Clarkson with
us because there's something that you,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.910
or at any rate, Cora, will want to hear.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.190
Do I detect that you're changing sides?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.640
Er, maybe.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.990
Have you told my mother?

06:16.040 --> 06:18.910
Poor man. If he's changing his
mind, don't let's put him off.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.750
Oh, that reminds me. I
have a message from her.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.760
She says that the Health Minister
is happy to dine here this Friday.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.790
What? How did she manage that?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.550
She must have found a
way to blackmail him.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.750
- You don't mean that.
- I wouldn't put it past her.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.280
If she's convinced him to come here,
she can make him condemn the scheme.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.070
Well, she mustn't.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.470
And I want the three of
you here to support me.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.260
Aye, aye, Captain.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.190
Is Mr Barrow getting on your nerves?

06:48.240 --> 06:51.720
- Only earlier, you seemed to --
- No, it's not that.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.110
He only means to be friendly.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.750
I know. And he was good to
me when I first arrived.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.670
So, what is it, then?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.000
Well...

07:00.080 --> 07:03.070
Since I've come, I've got to
know a bit more about him.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.720
I don't like to say with a lady present.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.190
We both know Mr Barrow pretty well.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.510
The point is, I wouldn't want
to give him any wrong ideas.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.790
I'm not sure that's fair.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.910
Fair or not, I think it's
better if he knows what's what.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.870
I bear him no ill will, mind.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.070
We are what we are.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.990
Isn't that the truth?

07:22.240 --> 07:23.990
My compliments to the chef.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.240
Who is Mrs Patmore, not me.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.830
What was Mr Molesley asking?

07:27.880 --> 07:31.760
Er, he wants to accompany Miss
Baxter into York on Wednesday morning.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.310
Apparently, you've said she can go.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.830
I have, yes.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.070
- Will you let him?
- I don't see why not.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.710
- What's it for?
- Sergeant Willis needs her help.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.590
Sergeant Willis again?

07:42.640 --> 07:46.120
Do other butlers have to contend with
the police arriving every ten minutes?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.270
Not often.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.120
Now, are you ready?

07:50.200 --> 07:51.340
Hmm.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.310
Are... Are these done enough?

07:56.360 --> 07:57.600
Yes.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.470
Shall I fetch the vegetables?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.360
This plate's cold, which is a pity.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.680
Ah, what's this?

08:09.760 --> 08:10.910
What do you think?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.630
Bubble and squeak.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.840
As a vegetable with lamb?

08:14.920 --> 08:16.720
I like it with lamb.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.520
Well, we mustn't let it get cold.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.950
This knife could do with sharpening.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.830
All settled in for the night?

08:37.880 --> 08:39.909
She is, but she won't sleep a wink.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.110
She's too annoyed and I don't blame her.

08:42.159 --> 08:45.150
- What's happened now?
- She says Doctor Clarkson has only planned

08:45.200 --> 08:47.470
to throw her over for Mrs Crawley.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.390
- She's seen it coming.
- What do you mean?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.430
He doesn't want to support
her ladyship any more.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.400
What cheek!

08:54.480 --> 08:56.070
Don't go working yourself up.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.960
(SCOFFS) Who does he think he is?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.030
Jumped up little saw-bones!

09:01.080 --> 09:02.950
I should steer clear.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.120
No doubt.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.830
But you and I don't think
alike, do we, Mr Spratt?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.020
On this or any other subject.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'll wish you good night.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.750
When's your train?

09:20.800 --> 09:23.230
- Nine. - Is this
another magazine crisis?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.390
No. But I am interviewing
possible editors.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.550
Women?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.910
- Women. - Well, I approve.
Good luck with that.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.430
- But then, who's the date with?
- It's not a date.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.950
It's just a friend, as I keep saying.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.280
What are you up to today? Haven't
you got some plan with a racing car?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.870
Later. We're looking for a site
for the repair shop this morning.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.230
Then we'll go over to
Catterick after lunch.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.750
I want to look in on Mason before we do.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.310
- He's moving in today.
- As long as the pigs are settled.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.070
You joke, but I am concerned.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.990
I've asked him to take over, but
pig-keeping needs physical strength,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.150
- now I think of it.
- You're right, of course.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.550
They're strong and can be dangerous.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.710
Ask him if he's up to it.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.190
- I think I must.
- A day of racing cars and pigs.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.550
- Who could better that?
- (CHUCKLES)

10:00.600 --> 10:03.640
- Who's dining at home this time?
- (LAUGHS) Nobody.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.390
It's to welcome Daisy's Mr Mason.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.790
He's moving in today.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.710
Wish him well from me.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.240
And I hope he gets more fun out
of his hamper than Mr Carson did.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.430
Why? What was the matter with it?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.430
Nothing was the matter with it.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.400
Except for the fact that, I don't
seem to cook like his mother.

10:19.480 --> 10:24.080
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I think the correct
response is to say "Men!" and sigh.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.270
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- What's this?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.880
Don't mind us.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.630
- How can I help?
- Miss Baxter is expecting me?

10:30.680 --> 10:32.680
Daisy, run and fetch her.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.030
Look after Miss Baxter, Sergeant.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.080
- She's in a very frail frame of mind.
- I'll do me best.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.360
But we're after catching a nasty fish
and he's bound to thresh about a bit.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.110
And we'll get caught in the spray?

10:43.160 --> 10:44.830
Good luck, love.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.760
If we put the gate here, you'd be on
a lane that links with the main road.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.510
You'd get power and plumbing
from the supply at King's Barrow.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.750
Why don't we put the repair shed there?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.350
King's Barrow is a working farm.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.230
There isn't a spare farmyard
half as accessible as here.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.480
We ought to look at the costs.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.870
It's good of you to come with me today.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.190
Glad to, but he won't want me there.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.240
Nonsense. You have far more
in common with him than I do.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.920
Is it serious?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.080
He's attractive and nice,

11:19.160 --> 11:22.440
and it's good to remember
I'm a youngish woman again.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.670
But that's all.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.060
Youngish?

11:26.320 --> 11:30.000
I don't mean to sound snobbish,
but I won't marry down.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.430
Was Mr Matthew Crawley so
very special in that way?

11:33.480 --> 11:36.800
Matthew was the heir to
the earldom and estate.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.990
I don't want to be
grander than my husband.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.390
Or richer.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.160
It may surprise you, but I agree
it's important to be balanced,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.790
that one should not be far
stronger than the other.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.200
I just don't think it has much
to do with money or position.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.800
Is that how you felt about Sybil?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.510
To all of you, she had
everything and I had nothing.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.200
She was the great lady, and
I the man who drove the cars,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.520
but that wasn't true for us.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.760
We were evenly matched, Sybil and I.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.440
She was strong in her beliefs, so was I.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.240
We were a marriage of
equals. We were very happy.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.950
I think we see that now.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.710
The family, I mean.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.510
Not at first, you're right.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.900
But now.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.870
- Good day to you.
- Good day?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.350
A wonder you've got the
nerve to speak to me.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.360
- I beg your pardon?
- Throwing over my lady,

12:38.440 --> 12:40.910
when she's been running this
village since you were eating

12:40.960 --> 12:42.710
porridge in the glen with your mummy.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.430
I don't believe I am required
to justify my actions to you.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.030
Because you can't.

12:47.080 --> 12:50.560
Tell me, what would you
call it? Gratitude?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.150
Because I'd call it treason.

12:53.200 --> 12:58.360
Would you? Well, I call it impertinence,
to a degree that is not acceptable.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.800
And I'm afraid you haven't
heard the last of this.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.230
Well, you look very chirpy.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.590
Oh, I think we'll have fun.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.590
Besides, I've had some news.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.590
They've nearly finished
the work on my house.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.230
- Oh, that was quick.
- Was it?

13:13.280 --> 13:16.110
It doesn't feel very
quick, but it's almost done.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.110
Now you just have to find some customers.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.700
But it's exciting, isn't it? (GIGGLES)

13:27.920 --> 13:30.310
- Did you hear?
- That he changed his plea? Yes.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.230
I was in court. I've only just come out.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.760
I expect when he heard that you turned
up, he must've known it was pointless.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.640
So I've been spared.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.310
How do you feel?

13:40.360 --> 13:42.670
In one way, I feel relieved, of course.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.760
The newspapers won't find me and
there'll be no repercussions.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.190
- But?
- I suppose I'd worked myself up

13:48.240 --> 13:51.280
into facing him across courtroom,
this man who ruined my life,

13:51.360 --> 13:55.200
and now it feels a bit anticlimactic.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.280
Shall I go back in and ask him
to plead not guilty after all?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.400
- No, thank you.
- (LAUGHS)

14:05.440 --> 14:08.640
We should leave. Sergeant
Willis is fetching the car.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.320
It does me good to see a friendly
woman bustling about a kitchen.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.520
I've got tea for all of us,
and a snack for you later on.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.830
You're an angel of mercy.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.990
Are we interrupting?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.110
Not a bit of it, m'lady.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.390
You're very welcome here.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.150
We had just wanted to look
in to see how you were doing.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.430
Daisy can tell you where
to find our office.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.820
Daisy will be a great help to me.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.640
We wanted to discuss the pigs.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.790
- Shall we go outside?
- We can talk here, m'lady.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.750
There's nothing private about it.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.030
Very well.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.670
Of course, I understand you
have a lot of experience.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.870
A great deal.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.470
I'm top at pigs.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.030
But Lady Mary is a little worried
about the physical side of it.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.120
Prising a boar off a sow or taking
the piglets from their mother.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.920
Is this because I'm older than I was?

14:59.120 --> 15:02.920
Of course, you may have already
chosen a farm hand to help you.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.960
We've discussed it, Mr Mason and I.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.390
He'll give me warning when there's
any chance of a bit of strong arm

15:09.440 --> 15:10.870
and I'll walk down from the house.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.590
So you'll be there for the servicing,
and the separating and the rest of it?

15:13.640 --> 15:16.270
We'll plan it round when
Mr Carson can release me.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.670
- It's not every day.
- That's very good of you, Andrew.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.830
I want to train in the
care of pigs, m'lady.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.790
I want to learn as much
as I can about farming.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.960
Oh, I see. Well, good.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.710
That seems to settle it.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.260
We must go. We're on our way
to Catterick and we're late.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.640
- We hope you'll be very happy here.
- Thank you.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.760
Well, I do want to train.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.310
I do want to learn.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.360
It were no word of a lie.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.390
Why does Lord Hexham spend
so much time in Tangier?

15:51.440 --> 15:53.070
I suppose he likes it there.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.910
If I had Brancaster Castle, I'm
not sure I'd ever want to leave.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.360
I agree.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.990
He's not really a country type.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.390
More arty than sporty,
if you know what I mean.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.430
He doesn't hunt or shoot?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.480
Hardly. He paints.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.990
What does he paint?

16:07.040 --> 16:09.680
The young men of Tangier, mainly.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.950
You know, scenes of local life.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.920
And he's never wanted to marry?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.470
I wouldn't quite say that.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.310
It's always been sort of
understood that he and his cousin,

16:18.360 --> 16:20.350
Adela Graham, will marry eventually.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.830
Understood by whom?

16:21.880 --> 16:23.270
By the two sets of parents.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.510
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:24.560 --> 16:26.100
How romantic.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.670
But you like him?

16:28.720 --> 16:31.150
You wouldn't ever want to
find something else to do?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.110
I'd hate to leave Brancaster

16:33.160 --> 16:36.360
and I'm very fond of Cousin Peter,
even if he isn't a countryman.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.840
He hasn't a nasty bone in his body.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.550
What are we doing this evening?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.030
Have I got your evening, too?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.710
Come to my flat for a
drink, I'll show it to you.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.390
Then we can go somewhere else. You choose.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.110
What a racy plan.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.670
Not as racy as all that, worse luck.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.710
But I'd like your opinion.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.630
And you shall have it.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.869
Charlie's going to beat him
again. It infuriates him.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.510
Mr Rogers is a good driver.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.630
I know, but they take such risks.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.510
I hate it. I just hate it.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.390
There's no such thing
as slow motor racing.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.920
Even so.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.150
And there's no such thing as safe love.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.430
Real love means giving
someone the power to hurt you.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.620
Which I won't concede easily.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.830
She went well.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.750
She's perfect, Charles.
Don't change a thing.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.590
I think I started after you.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.310
(LAUGHS) You're a bad loser!

18:12.360 --> 18:14.110
- Well?
- How fast.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.990
That is the general idea.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.670
It looks like she handles well.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.870
Will you take her to Brooklands?

18:18.920 --> 18:20.070
Brooklands and other tracks.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.110
I think I've found my new
car. What do you say, Charlie?

18:22.160 --> 18:24.270
Well, she must be good to beat me.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.070
- If you did.
- Oh, I did and I will again.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.550
Then we must celebrate.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.430
Well, there's a pub at Catterick.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.670
Not for me, I'm afraid. I have to go home.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.190
- Oh.
- Let's go anyway.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.440
Okay. Just let me get changed.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.390
Help him to enjoy it.

18:38.440 --> 18:42.440
You don't have to marry him, but you
do have to let him enjoy this moment.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.910
You're not nervous? Because I would be.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.990
No. I'm looking forward to it.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.430
We'll make a pig man of you yet.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.510
I'll lend you some books
when we go inside.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.150
- Books?
- On pig breeding and care.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.950
You need to know the theory of it.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.390
You'll be glad of the knowledge.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.710
It makes the work more logical.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.070
- (PIGS GRUNTING)
- Well, then.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.940
Thank you, we'll be in touch.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.590
- How many more?
- Just one.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.950
Miss Edmunds.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.310
Send her in.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.230
If you'd like to go in now.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.950
Please sit down.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.590
I've been reading about
your many achievements.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.270
Oh, I see you were born in '92.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.800
I know I might seem too young to be
an editor, but I do have experience.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.110
I was just going to say
we're born in the same year.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.120
Er, have you seen a copy
of our latest edition?

19:29.560 --> 19:30.910
I produced it, actually.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.560
Our editor had left, so it was down
to me and the rest of the office,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.350
and during one horror-filled
night, we did it.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.950
But then are you sure you need me?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.720
Oh, I am. But I have at least proved
you're old enough to be an editor.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.480
Because I was.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.080
1892 seems a million years ago now.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.560
Another time, another age.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.310
That might be worth exploring.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.670
Victorian babies grown into modern women.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.790
And the price they've paid.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.070
Oh. Thank you, Audrey.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.830
Mmm, this is something like it.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.390
(GIGGLES) I think you'll do well here.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.670
So do I.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.590
And you know what I wish?
That our Daisy would live here.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.000
You can still work at the big
house, but make a home with me.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.590
- I don't know.
- What is it?

20:13.640 --> 20:15.390
A 20-minute walk? What's that?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.710
I'll have to think about it.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.870
I wouldn't have to think long.
This place is like heaven to me.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.960
You never set foot off a
pavement for 18 years,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.470
and now it's all harvests and pig farming.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.910
Well, not everyone's right
for what they're born to.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.400
Very true. These are the books I spoke of.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.830
You'll learn most from the work, I know,

20:33.880 --> 20:36.030
but, er, they'll give you a grounding.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.710
- If you're serious.
- I am.

20:37.760 --> 20:42.080
Now, what else can I give you?
Another cup of tea, why not?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.900
Don't mind if I do.

20:47.920 --> 20:51.240
I'm afraid Mummy, and Daddy,
and Aunt Edith are all away,

20:51.320 --> 20:53.710
so you must make do with Granny and Donk.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.960
Is Granny Violet a Red Indian?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.550
Why on earth do you say that?

20:57.600 --> 21:00.280
Nanny said she was on the war path.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.950
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

21:02.000 --> 21:05.360
Come and look at these
books I've put out for you.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.920
These are some of the places
Donk and I have visited.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.640
Chamberlain's office rang to confirm
that he is dining here on Friday.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.230
I wish he weren't.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.950
But you'll line up the opposition?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.590
Certainly. I already have.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.230
What a nuisance it is.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.630
Mama is not a good loser.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.350
She's had so little experience.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.760
You couldn't just back off and
let the cards fall as they may.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.320
Robert, for 30 years, I've striven
to let your mother have her own way

21:31.400 --> 21:32.950
but this is too important.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.910
I appreciate that her
motives are honourable,

21:34.960 --> 21:38.120
but that's not enough when
she's damaging people's lives.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.670
Oh.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.190
We can cancel, if I'm
allowed to say you're ill.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.510
I'm not ill enough, and
she'd only rearrange it.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.910
She can obviously get Chamberlain
to do whatever she wants,

21:46.960 --> 21:48.630
though heaven knows why.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.910
What's this?

21:49.960 --> 21:52.190
That's the Sphinx, darling. In Egypt.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.680
- What?
- The Sphinx.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.840
A creature of secrets
that she never reveals.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.000
Rather like Granny Violet.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.320
What time will you get there, on Friday?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.640
Well, not much before eight.

22:07.720 --> 22:12.040
I want to be in possession of the room
by the time Mr Chamberlain arrives.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.200
Oh, dear!

22:15.280 --> 22:16.590
Bad news?

22:16.640 --> 22:17.790
Oh, dear...

22:17.840 --> 22:19.750
I wouldn't have brought it if I'd known.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.750
Er, Spratt, would you ask
Denker to come up here please?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.540
Of course, m'lady.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.190
You're quite agitated.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.910
Denker has disgraced herself.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.550
Well, how distressing for you.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.160
It's not that so much.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.870
It means I shall have to find a new maid.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.120
Yes, I see. A real punishment.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.270
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

22:38.320 --> 22:39.350
M'lady?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.670
Is it true you called
Doctor Clarkson a traitor?

22:41.720 --> 22:44.800
What? Surely not? Denker?

22:45.360 --> 22:48.840
I just thought he'd behaved
very badly towards your ladyship.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.040
It is not your place even to
have opinions of my acquaintance.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.710
Let alone express them.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.120
He can't claim your friendship now?
Not when he's turned against you!

22:58.200 --> 23:02.240
If I withdrew my friendship from
everyone who had spoken ill of me,

23:02.320 --> 23:04.030
my address book would be empty.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.150
Yes, but surely...

23:05.200 --> 23:09.400
For a lady's maid to insult a
physician in the open street!

23:09.480 --> 23:12.800
You've read too many novels, Denker.
You've seen too many moving pictures.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.670
I was sticking up for you.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.590
And for that, I will
write a tepid character,

23:17.640 --> 23:20.230
which may enable you to
find employment elsewhere.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.510
But from this house,
you must go, forthwith.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.590
But m'lady...

23:23.640 --> 23:26.190
You may stay tonight, but
you must go tomorrow.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.380
Go!

23:29.720 --> 23:34.000
Are you sure? I can't believe Doctor
Clarkson could wish her to lose her position.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.150
Then he shouldn't have sent it.

23:36.200 --> 23:40.080
When we unleash the dogs of war,
we must go where they take us.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.360
(WHIMPERS)

23:49.260 --> 23:51.770
Sorry about that. There
was rather a queue.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.130
It's popular. That's a good sign.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.570
Oh, you don't know the place?

23:54.620 --> 23:57.330
You'll laugh at me, but I've
hardly ever been in a public house.

23:57.380 --> 24:00.620
Matthew wasn't really a pub man and
Papa goes into the Grantham Arms

24:00.700 --> 24:02.890
about once a year to have
a drink with the tenants.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.890
Well, I'm afraid my life is
an altogether rougher affair.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.680
Consider me warned.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.730
So the car's a success?

24:10.780 --> 24:13.250
Well, I wasn't convinced
it would be, but it is.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.570
You must have a go sometime.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.690
I hope that's a real offer.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.970
You know, I didn't realise
you were so keen, Tom. Blast!

24:18.020 --> 24:19.290
You could have driven her today.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.010
You know I came to Downton as a chauffeur?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.130
Oh, Mary told me.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.810
But then, not every chauffeur
has a real love of cars.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.010
That's true enough.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.730
Oh, I'll tell you who was
talking about you the other day.

24:27.780 --> 24:28.930
Evelyn Napier.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.930
- Oh, how is he?
- He's well.

24:30.980 --> 24:34.500
Still single, of course, and, I
suspect, still pining for you.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.580
He will pine in vain, but
I'm very fond of him.

24:37.660 --> 24:39.610
La Belle Dame sans Merci.

24:39.660 --> 24:41.250
What does that mean?

24:41.300 --> 24:44.020
It means Lady Mary knows what she's about.

24:45.260 --> 24:48.380
Tell you what, next time you're down
south, why don't we all have dinner?

24:48.460 --> 24:49.970
I'd love that.

24:50.020 --> 24:52.410
- You are funny.
- What do you mean?

24:52.460 --> 24:54.650
The way you have to keep making
reasons for why you'll meet.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.370
You to watch him drive cars, you
to have dinner with a friend.

24:57.420 --> 25:00.420
Why can't you just say, "I'd
love to spend more time with you,

25:00.500 --> 25:01.650
"when can we do it?"

25:01.700 --> 25:04.290
You see? He may have
assimilated in some ways,

25:04.340 --> 25:06.810
but he still fights playing by the rules.

25:06.860 --> 25:08.260

25:17.100 --> 25:19.300
Oh! I didn't hear you come in.

25:20.020 --> 25:24.620
Mr Mason's lent me some books on
pig-rearing and farming, generally.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.010
I'm going to help with the pigs.

25:26.060 --> 25:27.860
Oh, I see.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.970
Which will you start with?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.690
The red one, I think.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.940
The "red one." Who's it by?

25:39.500 --> 25:41.260
FJ Connell.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.730
Does that mean anything to you?

25:42.780 --> 25:44.180
Not a lot.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.290
This must be the most sophisticated
room I've ever been in.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.970
The taste is all Michael's.

25:59.020 --> 26:01.490
He was very artistic and very clever.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.010
So, are you going to live here?

26:03.060 --> 26:04.930
I think I'll live here more.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.460
I'd like a life away from Downton.

26:07.540 --> 26:09.250
Because you like London?

26:09.300 --> 26:11.660
Well, the house, the estate,

26:11.740 --> 26:15.140
they're all Mary's now,
more than Papa realises.

26:15.220 --> 26:18.500
It's time for me to strike
out in my own direction,

26:18.580 --> 26:21.460
not just dawdle in Mary's wake.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.730
When do you go home this time?

26:23.780 --> 26:26.380
Tomorrow. My work is done here.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.170
I've found my new editor and
we've got a government minister

26:29.220 --> 26:31.930
coming for dinner on Friday,
so we're all on parade.

26:31.980 --> 26:33.570
That's very swanky.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.610
- Is your father political?
- Not at all.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.250
It's my grandmother who's invited him.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.410
How impressive!

26:38.460 --> 26:40.140
She is rather.

26:40.220 --> 26:41.690
Shall we go?

26:45.300 --> 26:47.420
I love the Cafe de Paris.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.890
How did you know to choose it?

26:48.940 --> 26:51.280

- God, what a relief.

I suppose you've guessed
how much I like you.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.570
You don't know me.

27:13.620 --> 27:17.100
I know you enough to think about
you all the time when we're apart.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.920
That's very sweet.

27:19.620 --> 27:22.260
Of course, I haven't much to offer.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.580
You have a great deal to offer

27:24.660 --> 27:27.700
and I am not sure I'm worthy of it,

27:27.780 --> 27:32.100
but for now let's just enjoy a good dinner

27:32.180 --> 27:33.650
and some dancing.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.240
- No arguments here.

- So it was a good day?
- Oh, yes.

time for the poor man.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.650

- If not always very sensibly.
- (CHUCKLES)

He's a lovely chap, though,
kind and considerate.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.890
Oh, he wants Daisy to live there,
but I suppose that's understandable.

27:56.940 --> 27:57.970
He must be lonely.

27:58.020 --> 28:00.490
He's not lonely. He's
lived on his own for years.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.130
- He's used to it.
- He enjoyed a bit of company today.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.570
He was just being polite.

28:04.620 --> 28:07.180
I expect he was longing for us to go.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.490
You mustn't mind when Mr Mason
makes new friends, Daisy,

28:14.540 --> 28:16.250
now that he's here among us.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.610
Of course I don't mind.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.410
I just think he's fine as he is.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.010
I'm ready to walk up to
the cottage if you are.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.850
- Of course. - Ah, Mrs
Patmore, I haven't thanked you

28:24.900 --> 28:26.010
for our supper the other night.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.210
I'm always happy to help.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.410
I'm very grateful.

28:28.460 --> 28:32.460
But another time, I wonder if you might go
through the cooking of it with Mrs Hughes.

28:32.540 --> 28:35.050
- Oh, yes? - It's been a
while since she's played

28:35.100 --> 28:38.580
with her patty pans, and she's
got some catching-up to do.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.330
You'd be glad of the help, wouldn't you?

28:40.380 --> 28:43.260
(LAUGHS) Very glad and very grateful.

28:43.740 --> 28:45.880
And now I must fetch my coat.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.130
I'm sorry, Miss Denker.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.770
I simply don't see I have a role to play.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.090
So you're just going to sit
there and let me be dismissed?

28:58.140 --> 28:59.690
How did it happen?

28:59.740 --> 29:02.740
- Were you drunk?
- No, I was not drunk!

29:02.820 --> 29:04.250
I was shocked!

29:04.300 --> 29:08.140
Shocked at the short memory of a
doctor who's failed his patroness!

29:08.220 --> 29:10.170
I doubt he sees it in that light.

29:10.220 --> 29:13.180
That's the way I saw it
and I acted accordingly.

29:13.260 --> 29:16.210
Am I to blame if I have
a very passionate nature?

29:16.260 --> 29:18.610
Any more of that talk and
I won't be able to sleep.

29:18.660 --> 29:23.140
You won't sleep a wink if I am
still sacked when we go upstairs.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.540
That's a risk I'll have to take.

31:06.860 --> 31:10.500
I could be a farm labourer,
but I want more than that.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.050
And if I can't read, then
it won't be possible.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.220
So another dream goes west.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.500
It doesn't have to.

31:17.580 --> 31:20.900
I'll teach you to read and
write, too, if you want.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.740
I must be too stupid.

31:23.820 --> 31:27.020
I've never picked it up so far, and
I would have if I had half a brain.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.060
That's not true. You're a clever lad.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.680
You will get the hang of it. Trust me.

31:33.740 --> 31:36.820
- But what would the others say?
- We won't tell them.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.770
We'll talk about it in
the morning, all right?

31:42.420 --> 31:43.900
Mr Barrow.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.340
I've not behaved well towards you.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.090
And I'm sorry for it.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.570
I've known worse.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.610
Good night, Andy.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.820
Oh! You're up early.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.170
I suppose you have quite a day ahead.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.970
- Are you packed?
- No.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.370
I have not packed.

32:11.420 --> 32:12.690
Shouldn't leave it too long.

32:12.740 --> 32:15.650
You should take up her
breakfast and dress her,

32:15.700 --> 32:19.180
to be sure of your reference,
and then, er, head off.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.650
Is that all you've got to say?

32:20.700 --> 32:24.740
Don't look at me. It's not my fault
and there is nothing I can do.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.370
(HUMMING CHEERFULLY)

32:27.420 --> 32:29.580
Did they catch your nephew?

32:29.660 --> 32:30.850
- What?
- Your nephew.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.730
The one who was on the
run from the police.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.650
The one you sheltered here.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.260
Did they catch him?

32:37.340 --> 32:39.620
I don't believe so. No.

32:39.700 --> 32:43.740
I wonder if that was because
he was allowed to rest here.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.760
I think, maybe, it was.

32:46.060 --> 32:50.940
Septimus Spratt, if I am sacked,
I am taking you down with me.

32:51.060 --> 32:54.180
And my sin is not a criminal offence.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.940
What can I do?

32:58.020 --> 33:00.050
I can't talk to her before she's dressed.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.970
No. Well, while you're waiting, you
can think of what you're going to say.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.690
Unless you want to find
yourself sewing mail bags.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.080
(EXHALES)

33:07.220 --> 33:09.930
I'm not promising anything. I mean,
suppose she doesn't listen to me?

33:09.980 --> 33:13.940
You'd better hope she
does, Mr Spratt. (GIGGLES)

33:14.020 --> 33:17.060
You'd better hope she does.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.930
I think she likes him, yes. But
I don't believe she's serious.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.290
Why not?

33:23.340 --> 33:25.450
Lady Mary has quite a
sense of her own importance

33:25.500 --> 33:27.450
and I doubt he's enough for her.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.780
Besides, what would he do here?

33:29.860 --> 33:32.130
Hang about, testing his cars on the drive?

33:32.180 --> 33:33.490
He could always get a job.

33:33.540 --> 33:34.730
Doing what?

33:34.780 --> 33:38.780
I'm not convinced there's a big
demand for racing drivers in Thirsk.

33:38.860 --> 33:42.860
So, Lady Mary does not believe
that love conquers all?

33:42.940 --> 33:45.410
We mustn't be hard on
her. She is what she is.

33:45.460 --> 33:49.340
But I'd say she'll want someone who
brings just as much to the table.

33:49.420 --> 33:50.650
Maybe I'm wrong.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.090
I hope so. I'd like her to be happy.

33:53.140 --> 33:56.860
I'm happy, and I want
everyone to be happy.

33:56.940 --> 33:58.210
Are you really happy?

33:58.260 --> 34:00.090
I'm happier than I have ever been.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.820
Happy, impatient, excited.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.410
Don't say too much.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.850
It frightens me.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.810
We've still got months.

34:08.860 --> 34:10.170
Nothing will go wrong.

34:10.219 --> 34:12.010
Bad harvest, bad harvest.

34:12.060 --> 34:14.290
- What does that mean?
- (GIGGLES)

34:14.340 --> 34:18.500
In the old days, when the crop was good,
the farmers used to shout "Bad harvest!",

34:18.580 --> 34:22.260
so the gods wouldn't grow jealous
of their luck and destroy them.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.210
(SHOUTS) Bad harvest!

34:25.139 --> 34:26.449
That ought to do it.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.420
Let's hope so.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.500
We'd better hurry or we'll
be late for breakfast.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.969
- Well? - She wants
you. In the drawing room.

34:35.020 --> 34:36.290
What did she say?

34:36.340 --> 34:37.409
What did you say?

34:37.460 --> 34:41.179
I told her your crime was
an excess of loyalty,

34:41.260 --> 34:44.139
that your devotion to
her had made you blind.

34:44.219 --> 34:48.020
It was the smugness of the
doctor that got my goat.

34:48.100 --> 34:49.770
That, I did not say.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.570
No, no. (STAMMERING) The
point is, did it work?

34:52.620 --> 34:56.780
I reminded her how hard it is to
find properly trained staff now.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.090
Yeah. And did it work?

34:58.140 --> 35:00.530
I asked her how long it
had taken to break you in.

35:00.580 --> 35:02.330
We'll have less of that talk.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.900
I just want to know, did it work?

35:05.940 --> 35:08.540
She's going to give you one more chance.

35:09.580 --> 35:10.610
Hallelujah!

35:10.660 --> 35:13.090
But mind you, act surprised
when she tells you.

35:13.140 --> 35:16.860
I will rival Saint Paul
in my astonishment.

35:17.060 --> 35:18.330
Right.

35:18.380 --> 35:20.820
Well, you better get upstairs.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.010
Oh, and Miss Denker,

35:22.060 --> 35:26.860
I don't want to hear another
mention of my unfortunate nephew.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.580
Oh, well, that rather depends.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.690
- On what?
- On whether or not

35:31.740 --> 35:33.880
I need to mention him again.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.690
He's not arrived, then?

35:43.740 --> 35:45.210
No, not yet.

35:45.260 --> 35:49.180
But what we want to know is, by
what power you made him come here.

35:49.260 --> 35:51.130
Well, power of personality.

35:51.180 --> 35:52.730
I'm not sure it would've worked for me.

35:52.780 --> 35:55.580
Works for me. Are you quite well?

35:55.660 --> 35:58.660
I will be all right as long
as no one asks me how I am.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.450
You heard your note nearly
proved fatal to poor Denker?

36:01.500 --> 36:04.410
Well, I only intended that she
be ticked off, not beheaded.

36:04.460 --> 36:09.060
I gather it was Spratt who saved her,
which is a surprise in any number of ways.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.260
Mama, what are you doing?

36:11.420 --> 36:15.580
Carson, Carson, can you change these
place cards in the dining room?

36:15.660 --> 36:17.850
- I'm not sure her ladyship...
- Robert?

36:17.900 --> 36:20.940
- Just do it.
- Yes, very well, m'lord.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.730
You'll be in a very junior seat.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.340
Il faut reculer pour mieux sauter.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.610
I found my editor.

36:26.660 --> 36:27.770
And had some fun, too, I hope.

36:27.820 --> 36:31.060
I went dancing at the Cafe de Paris,
which felt very young and gay.

36:31.140 --> 36:33.530
And we saw Henry Talbot
try out a racing car.

36:33.580 --> 36:35.250
So, now we're all members
of the Bright Young Things.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.730
I don't know about "bright."

36:36.780 --> 36:38.610
The Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain,

36:38.660 --> 36:40.010
Minister for Health.

36:40.060 --> 36:42.700
Lord Grantham. Lady Grantham.

36:42.780 --> 36:46.700
Minister, how kind of you to find
time for us in your busy schedule.

36:46.780 --> 36:48.330
We're very grateful.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.690
I wouldn't have the courage
to refuse your mother-in-law.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.340
There you are.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.220
How is dear Anne?

36:54.300 --> 36:55.690
She sends her greetings.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.140
Oh, how grown up you all are.

36:58.220 --> 37:04.460
You know, I remember so well when
you and she were young and carefree,

37:04.540 --> 37:06.970
looking for fun wherever
you could find it.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.450
I know you do.

37:08.500 --> 37:13.420
Yes, well, but I always say,
let the past stay in the past.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.440
I always say that, too.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.900
Have you met my cousin Mrs Crawley?

37:19.980 --> 37:21.690
No, indeed. It's a great honour.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.540
I gather you're here to discuss the
new plans for managing our health.

37:25.620 --> 37:29.380
I know I'm here to discuss a topic
Lady Grantham is interested in.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.200
Excuse me, would you
care for one of these?

37:34.020 --> 37:35.170
Thank you.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.170
I thought you needed rescuing.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.770
Our own scrapes are bad enough without
being dragged into other people's.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.210
How well you understand me.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.970
I'm afraid you're in for
some rigorous debate.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.690
I wish I weren't.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.500
Shall we go in?

37:46.980 --> 37:51.220
We don't want to wear the minister out
before he's even had a chance to sit down.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.530
She can't protect him in the dining room.

37:55.580 --> 37:58.980
You'll stop at nothing to get
your own way. Isn't that the truth?

37:59.060 --> 38:00.500
Indeed.

38:00.580 --> 38:06.740
It is a quality I share with Marlborough,
Wellington and my late mother.

38:06.820 --> 38:10.180
I was trained in a hard school

38:10.260 --> 38:12.700
and I fight accordingly.

38:12.780 --> 38:16.780
No, he's a coming man. I've read
he may be prime minister one day.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.610
Well, he's no friend of the unions.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.490
For which he is to be congratulated.

38:20.540 --> 38:22.610
Is the consomme ready, Mrs Patmore?

38:22.660 --> 38:24.860
We should get out of your way.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.600
You never said how the trial went.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.210
I didn't have to testify in the end.

38:30.260 --> 38:33.300
He looked at the list of
witnesses and changed his plea.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.890
You must have a sense
of unfinished business.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.770
That's clever of you.

38:37.820 --> 38:41.620
I won't ask what it was, but I
hope you can leave it behind.

38:41.740 --> 38:43.690
I'm not sure. But thank you.

38:43.740 --> 38:46.820
Mr Molesley says the Dowager's
got the bit between her teeth.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.130
Then I don't give much for
Mr Chamberlain's chances.

38:49.180 --> 38:52.180
- Nor me. - But surely, if
it's important to the area,

38:52.260 --> 38:53.970
he'll want to listen?

38:54.020 --> 38:56.360
He'll just want to get out alive.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.610
The system has worked well
here for a hundred years!

39:00.660 --> 39:04.660
Why must we destroy everything in our
path simply for the sake of change?

39:04.740 --> 39:07.780
I'm not sure that's a true
representation of the case.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.610
Exactly. There are many
benefits to be had from the plan.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.090
But benefits for whom?

39:12.140 --> 39:13.250
Goodness.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.460
I thought I was here to be
lectured by a united group,

39:16.540 --> 39:18.210
not to witness a battle royal.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.600
Oh! Don't you enjoy a good fight?

39:20.660 --> 39:21.970
I'm not sure I do, really.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.940
My mother-in-law has a certain myopia when
it comes to anyone else's point of view.

39:26.020 --> 39:28.730
On the contrary, I have
a clarity of vision

39:28.780 --> 39:32.660
that allows me to resist a
housemaid's trap of sentimentality.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.970
Your enthusiasm is getting
the better of your manners.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.770
Can't we stop this beastly row?

39:36.820 --> 39:38.170
How I wish we could.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.330
Because I...

39:39.380 --> 39:40.810
I... (GROANS)

39:40.860 --> 39:42.460
I'm so sorry...

39:43.180 --> 39:45.180
(RETCHING)

39:46.820 --> 39:48.810
(SCREAMING)

39:48.860 --> 39:50.490
Thomas, on his left side.

39:50.540 --> 39:51.970
Give me napkins!

39:52.020 --> 39:53.290
I'll call the ambulance.

39:53.340 --> 39:54.890
- Keep him warm.
- Take my coat.

39:54.940 --> 39:56.730
- What is it?
- His ulcer has burst.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.130
- What?
- Will he be all right?

39:58.180 --> 40:00.210
We must get him to hospital
as quickly as we can.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.770
- (RETCHING)
- I'm here, darling, don't worry.

40:02.820 --> 40:06.940
If this is it, just know I
have loved you very, very much.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.650
This isn't it, darling.
Don't... We won't let this be it.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.610
- Some water?
- No! No water.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.730
(COUGHING)

40:12.780 --> 40:15.290
Just keep him steady until
the ambulance arrives.

40:15.340 --> 40:17.340
(GASPING)

40:18.700 --> 40:20.700
(COUGHING)

40:25.980 --> 40:28.410
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

40:28.460 --> 40:29.530
Is he very bad?

40:29.580 --> 40:31.610
I've rung for the ambulance.
It'll be here at any moment.

40:31.660 --> 40:34.620
Miss Baxter, Anna, fetch
their ladyships' coats.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.850
- Don't forget Lady Edith.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

40:36.900 --> 40:39.370
You might put together some
things that could be useful.

40:39.420 --> 40:41.730
But hurry, there's no time to lose.

40:41.780 --> 40:44.340
- I can't believe it.
- (PANTING)

40:44.420 --> 40:47.820
Life is short, death is sure.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.700
That is all we know.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.690
There is a man who's been
shaken to the roots of his soul.

40:54.740 --> 40:58.140
Everything he based his life
on has proved mortal, after all.

40:58.220 --> 41:00.730
We've no time for philosophy, Mrs Patmore.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.250
What can we do to help?

41:02.300 --> 41:04.370
Let's send up some coffee.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.610
Lady Grantham, I'm not sure
how much use I can be here.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.250
Of course, you should go.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.730
I will consider the new plan.

41:17.780 --> 41:20.180
Don't. That is, let it stand.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.250
I believe the change will work
well for both establishments.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.610
Very well.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.770
- Lady Grantham.
- Give my love to dear Annie.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.090
I will.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.490
The ambulance is here!

41:31.100 --> 41:34.210
Don't reprimand me, Mama, I think
the new system will be better

41:34.260 --> 41:36.290
and I haven't got time to be diplomatic.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.930
Don't you think I have
enough things to worry about?

41:38.980 --> 41:41.170
It's better we should be honest.
There've been too many secrets.

41:41.220 --> 41:43.700
Let's have no more of them.

41:43.780 --> 41:47.260
If you mean Marigold, that's
settled and you know I am sorry.

41:47.340 --> 41:49.330
Now let us concentrate on Robert?

41:49.380 --> 41:52.050
They're ready. They want to take him now.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.460
Girls. Mary. Edith.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.010
We must go!

42:00.900 --> 42:04.300
Edith, dear, telephone with any news.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.650
- No matter how late.
- I will.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.610
I'll take you home in my
car. And Lady Grantham.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.130
In a moment.

42:12.940 --> 42:14.290
You're quite pale.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.010
We'll go together.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.530
You've had a shock.

42:17.580 --> 42:20.500
I think I've had a few
shocks this evening.

42:30.700 --> 42:34.660
- They're bringing your car round.
- Oh, let the ambulance get away.

42:36.980 --> 42:39.690
There's a dinner that delivered
more than you bargained for.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.530
Are you going to follow them?

42:41.580 --> 42:44.330
I don't want to crowd him, but
they'll ring when they have news.

42:44.380 --> 42:46.010
Can you let my office know?

42:46.060 --> 42:47.460
Of course.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.490
If you'll do me a favour
and answer one question.

42:50.540 --> 42:52.530
Why did you come here tonight?

42:52.580 --> 42:55.540
Your grandmother-in-law
can be very persuasive.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.610
I'd love to know how she did it.

42:57.660 --> 43:00.210
My wife has a brother
called Horace de Vere Cole.

43:00.260 --> 43:03.010
- You may have heard of him.
- The prankster?

43:03.060 --> 43:06.220
Didn't he board a warship pretending to
be the leader of a Turkish delegation?

43:06.300 --> 43:07.930
Abyssinian, but yes.

43:07.980 --> 43:10.330
He was always doing that sort of thing.

43:10.380 --> 43:14.780
Some years ago, he and a few friends
dug a trench across Piccadilly

43:14.860 --> 43:17.400
and London was thrown into total chaos.

43:17.460 --> 43:20.540
- But what --
- I was one of the chaps responsible.

43:20.620 --> 43:22.490
We dressed as workmen
and no one stopped us.

43:22.540 --> 43:25.010
And by the time we'd finished
every road was jammed

43:25.060 --> 43:27.330
from the East End to Belgrave Square.

43:27.380 --> 43:29.410
And old Lady Grantham
threatened to give you away?

43:29.460 --> 43:31.460
It was long ago now,

43:31.540 --> 43:35.020
but the papers would be sure to
make it look as bad as possible

43:35.100 --> 43:38.740
and a dinner seemed a price
worth paying to avert it.

43:38.820 --> 43:41.020
And there's my car.

43:41.100 --> 43:43.580
So, I'd better be off.

44:25.860 --> 44:27.740
Thank you, m'lady.

44:35.540 --> 44:37.500
That was Lady Mary.

44:37.580 --> 44:41.620
His lordship's had his
operation and now he's resting.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.490
Her ladyship is staying overnight,

44:43.540 --> 44:45.970
but Lady Mary and Lady
Edith will come home.

44:46.020 --> 44:49.420
- What was the operation?
- They performed a gastrectomy.

44:49.500 --> 44:50.970
What's that?

44:51.620 --> 44:53.210
No business of ours.

44:53.260 --> 44:55.090
Will he be all right?

44:55.140 --> 44:57.330
It sounds as if he has a good chance.

44:57.380 --> 44:59.050
(SIGHS) Thank God.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.170
I'll find out if there's
anything he needs in the morning.

45:01.220 --> 45:03.450
I'll walk down there now with
some things for her ladyship.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.210
I'll come with you.

45:05.260 --> 45:06.850
I'm quite relieved.

45:06.900 --> 45:07.930
Of course you are.

45:07.980 --> 45:10.980
No, I didn't think I'd mind one
way or the other, to be honest.

45:11.060 --> 45:14.220
(CHUCKLES) I must be
getting soft in my old age.

45:14.300 --> 45:16.890
Well, don't let the other animals
find out, or they'll pounce.

45:16.940 --> 45:19.460
Leave him alone. Now, we should go.

45:20.980 --> 45:24.220
We can take it in turns tomorrow.
So Mama can have some rest.

45:24.300 --> 45:25.570
Very well.

45:25.620 --> 45:29.700
I'll go first. Stark can take
me there and bring Mama back.

45:29.780 --> 45:31.570
What a terrifying reminder.

45:31.620 --> 45:33.850
In one second your whole life can change.

45:33.900 --> 45:35.040
Yes.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.660
It only takes a moment for
everything to feel quite different.

45:38.740 --> 45:40.890
I'm going to check on the children.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.680
Of course you are.

45:43.460 --> 45:44.930
Good night.

45:46.140 --> 45:47.490
How is he?

45:47.540 --> 45:50.050
He'll be all right, but it's
knocked the stuffing out of him.

45:50.100 --> 45:52.610
We'll have to make sure the load
is lightened when he comes home.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.600
To be more precise, Tom,

45:54.660 --> 45:58.540
from now on you and I need to take
full responsibility for the estate.

45:58.620 --> 46:01.090
We'll involve him in the
big decisions of course,

46:01.140 --> 46:03.290
but he mustn't have any more worry.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.850
It's why he got the
ulcer in the first place.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.170
So long live our own Queen Mary.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.370
Good night.

46:18.460 --> 46:21.290
Mr Carson told us his
lordship is going to recover.

46:21.340 --> 46:22.730
They seem to think so.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.610
Everyone was very happy to hear it.

46:24.660 --> 46:26.450
Can I fetch you anything?

46:26.500 --> 46:28.820
I just want to go to bed.

46:28.900 --> 46:31.980
- You must be absolutely
exhausted. - Hmm.

46:33.700 --> 46:36.660
Anna, can I ask you something?

46:36.740 --> 46:40.220
Is there any talk in the servants'
hall about Miss Marigold?

46:41.380 --> 46:43.450
What sort of talk, m'lady?

46:44.500 --> 46:48.460
Well, everyone thinks she's a lucky
little girl, being taken in by the family.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.610
But they would think that.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.770
And that's all you want to say?

46:55.180 --> 46:57.860
Why? What else should I say?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.660
Never mind.

46:59.740 --> 47:02.420
I'm too tired to talk any more tonight.

47:14.620 --> 47:17.770
We are opening the house for one day
for charity and there is none to it.

47:17.820 --> 47:20.410
What are they paying to see?
We have nothing to show them.

47:20.460 --> 47:23.090
- Do you need cheering up?
- We all need it sometimes m'lady.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.890
Have you found anyone
to hit with that yet?

47:24.940 --> 47:29.780
If I could choose between principle and
logic, I'd take principle every time!
