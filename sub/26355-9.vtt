WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:12.046
(clears throat)

00:12.080 --> 00:15.349
Webster's defines "class"
as "a group of students

00:15.383 --> 00:19.220
gathered at a pre-ordained time
for the purposes of education."

00:19.253 --> 00:22.490
Angela pretty much
epitomized class.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.060
Who could turn the world on
with her smile? Angela.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.561
Who could take a nothing day

00:27.595 --> 00:31.165
and suddenly make it all
seem worthwhile? Angela.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.202
So no one told you life
was gonna be this way.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.937
Angela.

00:36.970 --> 00:40.908
Sometimes you want to go
where everybody knows your name.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.210
Angela.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.246
(singing Sanford and Son
theme song)

00:47.315 --> 00:48.616
Angela.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.085
I'm sorry. Death is hard for me.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.887
But at least Angela died
doing what she loved:

00:53.921 --> 00:56.857
swimming less than 20 minutes
after she had eaten.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.560
That's a real thing, kids.
Listen to your mothers.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.364
That was Angela.
Fearless. Spontaneous.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.400
Honest, about herself
just as much as she was

01:06.434 --> 01:08.269
about the world around her.

01:08.302 --> 01:12.940
She had grace, courage,
and an unmatched zest for life.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.776
She may be gone,
but her voice will live on

01:15.809 --> 01:18.146
in DVD and Hulu Plus

01:18.179 --> 01:21.415
and tiny droid-projected
messages.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.884
I may have lost a boss,

01:23.917 --> 01:26.920
but heaven has gained
a princess.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.793
And I am at the wrong funeral.

01:34.795 --> 01:38.566
* It seems today
that all you see *

01:38.599 --> 01:41.935
* Is violence in movies
and sex on TV *

01:41.969 --> 01:45.606
* But where are those
good old-fashioned values *

01:45.639 --> 01:48.476
* On which we used to rely? *

01:48.509 --> 01:51.945
* Lucky there's a family guy *

01:51.979 --> 01:55.316
* Lucky there's a man who
positively can do *

01:55.349 --> 01:56.950
* All the things that make us *

01:56.984 --> 01:58.752
* Laugh and cry *

01:58.786 --> 02:03.324
* He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! *

02:08.529 --> 02:10.130
(quiet chatter)

02:10.164 --> 02:12.132
Any idea what
this meeting is about?

02:12.166 --> 02:15.469
(unintelligible babbling)

02:15.503 --> 02:18.539
Oh, we're getting a new boss?
Oh, I hope it's Hugo Boss.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.140
Then we'll all look snazzy.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.609
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight's episode of Family Guy

02:21.642 --> 02:23.544
is brought to you by Hugo Boss.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.779
Look for us in the
low-trafficked corner of Macy's

02:25.813 --> 02:28.982
between Eddie Bauer and
the never-bought male jewelry.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.152
Attention, everyone!
Do not adjust your TV sets.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.455
We are an interracial couple.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.123
I'd like to introduce myself.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.460
My name is Bert and this
is my lovely wife Sheila.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.330
Two sets of disappointed parents
right there.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.532
-Well, only her parents.
-Aah!

02:44.565 --> 02:46.567
Now that Angela's
no longer with us,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.536
we will be your new bosses.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.571
We're splitting the job
because one of the shareholders'

02:50.604 --> 02:53.341
favorite songs was
"Ebony and Ivory,"

02:53.374 --> 02:55.843
so here we are. (chuckles)

02:55.876 --> 02:57.745
SHEILA: Now we know
it's difficult to remember

02:57.778 --> 03:00.180
two new names,
so to make things easier,

03:00.214 --> 03:02.816
-you can call us "Beila."
-BERT: Or "Shert."

03:02.850 --> 03:04.685
(Bert and Sheila laugh)

03:04.718 --> 03:06.920
Boy, I bet you
she's a handful in the bedroom.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.322
Two handfuls, baby.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.358
Damn it, I went all the way
around the room!

03:10.391 --> 03:12.526
Now, some of you
may find the idea

03:12.560 --> 03:15.496
of two bosses
unconventional, but...

03:15.529 --> 03:18.499
(alternating words): we assure
you nothing will be different.

03:18.532 --> 03:24.104
And our door will always be open
to you any time of day.

03:24.137 --> 03:28.876
And there is no issue
too big or too small.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.579
Nice to meet all of you.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.715
So, as our mascot
Pawtucket Pat says,

03:34.748 --> 03:38.319
"All ye Federalists, imbibe!"

03:40.087 --> 03:41.922
It means, "Everybody, drink."

03:41.955 --> 03:43.223
ALL:
Yay!

03:43.257 --> 03:45.359
Two bosses? This sucks.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.428
Well, at least it beats
being home with my wife.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.596
LOIS:
Peter!

03:48.629 --> 03:51.432
Aah! When did we cut back home?

03:57.104 --> 03:58.972
-Hey, Peter.
-All right, Sheila,

03:59.006 --> 04:01.409
let's do it right here
on the desk while Bert watches.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.311
No, Peter,
that's not what this is.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.413
Sorry, I-I thought
I was picking up on a vibe.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.148
So, Peter, we've been tasked
with making the operations

04:08.181 --> 04:10.751
around here
run more efficiently,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.754
and part of that will involve
reassigning people

04:13.787 --> 04:15.389
based on their abilities.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.258
We want you to be
the office recyclables guy.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.227
So we're gonna
put a flag on you,

04:20.260 --> 04:21.962
and wherever you go,
people will know

04:21.995 --> 04:24.465
that's where they put
their recyclables.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.268
Please don't just
throw them over.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.740
Well, at least make sure all
the liquids are gone, please,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.475
before you throw them.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.946
Smithers, who is that
young go-getter?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.181
That's a character
from another show, sir.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.485
-Simpson, you say?
-Pretty much, sir.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.791
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to Titanic 2,

04:50.824 --> 04:52.493
narrated by Al Gore.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.530
Iceberg, right ahead!

04:56.564 --> 05:00.534
AL GORE: But due to man's
excessive use of fossil fuels,

05:00.568 --> 05:02.670
climate change
had rendered the iceberg

05:02.703 --> 05:05.038
nothing more than a small cube.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.977
Peter, why are you
wearing a flag?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.646
Eh, it's part of my job now
'cause of my new bosses.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.548
Uh, is it a promotion?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.550
Because it doesn't
look like a promotion.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.986
No, it looks like
an old lady's Rascal.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.389
-Aah!
-So, who are these new bosses?

05:21.422 --> 05:24.692
Their names are Bert and Sheila.
My job sucks now.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.027
It's worse than when
I was a dinosaur walker.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.030
-(whistles) Hey!
-What?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.832
-Pick that up!
-Pick what up?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.867
-That!
-That? That was there.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.636
No, you were looking
at your phone.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.237
-No, I wasn't.
-Yes, you were.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.639
Sir, this is a neighborhood

05:38.672 --> 05:40.674
where we respect
the rules of society.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.510
Ooh! Society now.
Sir Thomas More up here.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.877
Good for you
and your neighborhood.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.346
I'm gonna take a picture of you
and post it on Facebook.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.416
Oh, great!
I hope it gets a lot of likes.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.850
You know what?
I forgot my bag.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.552
-Ooh, you forgot your bag?
-Yeah, I forgot my bag.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.086
But I'll be sure to come back

05:53.120 --> 05:54.988
-and pick this up.
-Oh, yes, I'm sure
you'll be back.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.824
Look, I'm only here to create
an amusing comparison

05:56.857 --> 05:58.392
-to my current job...
-Well, bully for you.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.693
...which I am, at this moment,

05:59.727 --> 06:01.361
describing to my family
in my living room.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.196
So, technically,
you don't even exist.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.666
Well, how do you know I wasn't
telling my wife a story

06:05.699 --> 06:07.868
and you're a figment
of my imagination?

06:07.901 --> 06:10.370
I-I can assure you
that is not the case.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.206
ANNOUNCER: We'll be right back
with more Greg in the Window.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.675
PETER:
Well, I'll be.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.710
CHOIR:
* Window! *

06:16.744 --> 06:18.879
ANNOUNCER: Greg in the Window,
brought to you by

06:18.912 --> 06:20.914
never-bought male jewelry.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.088
Okay, Peter, we've got
something else for you.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.792
We need you to taste test our
new varieties of seasonal beers,

06:31.825 --> 06:34.027
which will be coming down
this conveyor belt.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.629
Place those on this tray.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.230
All right,
that seems easy enough.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.899
Also, our delivery truck drivers

06:38.932 --> 06:40.901
have to pass
an annual drug test,

06:40.934 --> 06:43.370
so we'll need you to collect
their urine samples.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.405
They'll be coming down
this same conveyor belt

06:45.439 --> 06:47.240
in similarly colored cups,

06:47.274 --> 06:49.577
which you will need to place
on this tray.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
Well, that doesn't
seem like a...

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Belt activated.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.583
-(buzzer sounds)
-Uh, showtime.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.585
(sniffs)

06:57.618 --> 06:59.820
Pumpkin, not bad.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.055
(sniffs)
Ugh, trucker pee.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.558
-(buzzer sounds)
-AUTOMATED VOICE:
Belt speed increasing.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.726
Oh, boy.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.496
(sniffs)
Apple cinnamon, not bad.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.430
(sniffs)
Pee laced with meth.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.934
(sniffs) Winter wheat.
(sniffs) Lady trucker pee.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.436
-(buzzer sounds)
-AUTOMATED VOICE:
Belt speed maximum.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.406
Ah, crap! Trucker. Trucker.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.575
Oktoberfest. Trucker.

07:21.609 --> 07:25.412
Amber squash, yuck.
Trucker. Trucker.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.315
And let's hope this one
was an Asparagus IPA.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.656
Too bad about the latest
sales numbers, huh?

07:35.689 --> 07:38.291
I don't talk to anyone
standing at a urinal.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.794
Too bad about the latest
sales numbers, huh?

07:40.828 --> 07:41.962
Thanks for waiting.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.864
You know, our testing
came back and shows

07:43.897 --> 07:45.499
we're losing market share.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.802
Apparently, nobody can relate
to our mascot Pawtucket Pat.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.871
SHEILA: Are you guys
talking about work in there?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.807
Oh, yes, come on in, honey.
We've put our wangs away.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.776
Did you tell him
about our testing?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.679
Yeah, our customers find
a 300-year-old mascot

07:58.712 --> 08:02.015
hard to relate to;
they want a regular guy.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.886
You know, a-a guy who'd
drink a beer on a toilet.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.121
(beer can opens, slurping)

08:08.155 --> 08:09.723
Griffin?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.024
PETER:
No.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.325
It is you, Peter.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.861
What are you doing?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.329
Playing a game on my phone
and having a beer.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.031
And, God willing,
going to the bathroom.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.000
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.169
He must be (bleep)
on his shirt tail?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.071
Ew, yes, but also,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.873
that's exactly
the kind of customer

08:25.906 --> 08:27.507
we should be appealing to.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.844
I think we found our new mascot.
Are you in, Peter?

08:30.878 --> 08:33.847
May I have a moment
to talk it over with my mentor?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.849
Sure.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.019
(two loud farts)

08:39.052 --> 08:41.689
-I'm in.
-(loud fart)

08:41.722 --> 08:43.724
No. We did it.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.933
Wow, Peter, so you're really
replacing Pawtucket Pat

08:52.966 --> 08:56.103
-as the new mascot?
-Yup, I'm the new Pawtucket Pat.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.038
Hey, now you
and Jared from Subway

08:58.071 --> 08:59.539
have two things in common.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.542
No! No, that's not true, Meg!
It's not true!

09:02.576 --> 09:04.377
Peter, Peter, she's garbage.
She's garbage.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.547
-Let it go. You're the king.
-Yeah, garbage, yeah.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.916
Anyway, turn on the TV.

09:08.949 --> 09:12.085
They're about to play
my first commercial.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.926
(seagulls squawking)

09:23.330 --> 09:25.332
(barge horn blaring)

09:35.075 --> 09:36.443
(Puerto Rican music
playing loudly)

09:37.277 --> 09:38.578
(Peter sighs)

09:38.612 --> 09:40.247
ANNOUNCER:
Pawtucket Patriot:

09:40.280 --> 09:42.916
the perfect beer
for New England beaches.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.952
(thunder cracks)

09:48.956 --> 09:51.124
BASEBALL ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.927
throwing out today's
ceremonial first pitch,

09:53.961 --> 09:56.830
the face of
the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery,

09:56.864 --> 09:58.866
-Pawtucket Pat!
-(crowd cheering)

10:07.307 --> 10:10.577
-(bones crunch)
-Aah! Please kill me!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.412
-Still buy the beer, though.
-(crowd cheering)

10:12.445 --> 10:16.116
BASEBALL ANNOUNCER: And now,
a five-hour baseball game.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.617
Hey, guys,
I'm Billy on the Street,

10:17.651 --> 10:19.352
and I'm here with
one of the biggest mascots

10:19.386 --> 10:22.255
-in America right now.
-Popular, he means. Not large.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.590
Let me do my intro!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.993
Okay, we're gonna go up
to people and give a dollar

10:26.026 --> 10:28.261
to everyone who recognizes you.
Let's go.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.098
Sir, sir, sir, for a dollar,
do you know who this is?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.466
-No.
-Oh, come on,
he's in a new commercial.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.968
I don't even own a TV.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.305
Oh, you don't own a TV?
I'm very impressed! Let's go!

10:38.338 --> 10:40.173
Sir, sir, quick, tell me.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.842
-Who is this man?
-Uh...

10:41.875 --> 10:44.644
Adweek magazine called him
the Pitchman of the Year.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.479
Who doesn't read Adweek?!

10:46.513 --> 10:48.181
(panting): There's, uh,
there's more running

10:48.215 --> 10:49.717
than I thought there'd be.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.352
-Oh, is he Jerry Ferrara?
-Jerry Ferrara?

10:52.385 --> 10:55.122
You mean Turtle from Entourage?
You're the worst!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.824
Even worse than
the Entourage movie!

10:56.857 --> 11:00.027
Mark Wahlberg is one of
our finest producers!

11:00.060 --> 11:02.996
I-I don't, uh, I-I don't feel
comfortable doing this.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.498
He was just getting a cup
of coffee with his daughter.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.201
-They should know you!
-Hey, you're Pawtucket Pat.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.037
Yes, thank you!
He's Pawtucket Pat!

11:10.070 --> 11:11.705
Not that I watch this show.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.808
I watch Black Mirror and
The Goldbergs, and that's it!

11:14.842 --> 11:16.744
Wow, can I get
a picture with you?

11:16.777 --> 11:19.146
-No!
-What's his problem?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.849
Between you and me, I think
he may need a lady friend.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.683
Peter, I'm famously gay!

11:23.717 --> 11:26.286
Oh, my God,
he ran around the world.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.493
Hey, so how's the whole
Pawtucket Pat thing going?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.661
Aw, it's the best.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.897
Everywhere I go,
people recognize me and love me.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.066
And the other day,
I even got to hang out

11:39.099 --> 11:41.368
with a bunch
of other famous mascots.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.171
So, you, uh, you really make
all those cookies in that tree?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.239
-They're great!
-Like, the tree is wood.
-Ho, ho, ho.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.341
Like, how does the tree
not catch on fire?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.377
-Hey, you want to cool it
with that drumming?
-Aflac.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
Anyway, do you have
to water your house?

11:52.445 --> 11:53.747
-'Cause I would think that...
-They're great!

11:53.781 --> 11:55.448
You know what, let's just forget
the conversation

11:55.482 --> 11:57.951
and just pose for the picture.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.287
By the way, Tony,
I'm sorry your wife was shot

12:00.320 --> 12:02.322
by Donald Trump's children.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.593
(knock on door)

12:06.626 --> 12:10.063
(alternating words): Hi, Peter.
It's me, Sheila, and me, Bert.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.866
Here's a dollar!
Stop talking like that!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.634
Sorry about him.
We ruined people's days

12:14.667 --> 12:15.969
in New York earlier.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.704
We came by to share
some great news.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.039
That's right.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.640
Your character's so popular,

12:20.673 --> 12:24.444
you're gonna have a balloon
in the annual Quahog Parade!

12:24.477 --> 12:27.647
-No way. That's awesome!
-Said no one ever.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.783
Ah. (laughs) Yes.
I've seen that on the Internet.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.118
Uh, who is this?

12:31.151 --> 12:33.153
Oh, that's-that's my dog, Brian.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.422
You have a dog that makes jokes
and drinks beer?

12:35.455 --> 12:36.990
Not just any beer.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.059
Pawtucket Patriot
Truckers Blend.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.429
-Ah, I approved that.
-Oh, this is just what we need.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.898
-You guys are great together.
-What are you talking about?

12:44.932 --> 12:48.836
Well, think about it, Peter.
The public loves Pawtucket Pat.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.138
Imagine how much
they'd love to know

12:51.171 --> 12:54.474
he has a funny sidekick dog
who drinks with him.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.310
Wow, that could be really cool.
What do you say, Brian?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.446
You're saying you need
a mascot's sidekick?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.948
Hold my beer.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.450
Uhp, that's also
from the Internet.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.458
Hi, I'm Bert of Bert and Sheila.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.792
And I'm Sheila.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.028
All right. Now, before
we bring out Daughtry...

13:15.062 --> 13:18.465
LOIS: Hurry it up!
Some of us came for Daughtry!

13:18.498 --> 13:21.801
...it's our pleasure
to introduce Pawtucket Pat

13:21.835 --> 13:24.771
and his new sidekick
Hops McElaney,

13:24.804 --> 13:28.041
the Alcoholic Dog.
Come on, y'all!

13:28.075 --> 13:30.143
(crowd cheering)

13:30.177 --> 13:31.811
-Say, Brian...
-"Hops."

13:31.845 --> 13:33.146
-Hops.
-Yes, Peter?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.381
-"Pat."
-Pat.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.716
What were you doing
up on the roof last night?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.218
-Well, Peter...
-"Pat."

13:38.251 --> 13:39.887
Pat. I was up on the roof

13:39.920 --> 13:42.489
because you told me
drinks were on the house.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.824
(cheering)

13:44.858 --> 13:46.159
Nice one, Brian.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.327
-"Hops."
-Hops.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.062
MAN:
Let's hear more from the dog!

13:49.096 --> 13:50.530
CROWD (chanting):
Hops! Hops! Hops!

13:50.563 --> 13:53.200
LOIS:
And Daughtry!

13:56.703 --> 13:59.339
I'm sorry, sir,
you can't park here.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.341
This spot is reserved
for the brewery mascot.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.143
Yeah, I am the brewery mascot.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.014
No, you're the brewery mascot's
sidekick.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.219
What the hell? I'm the sidekick?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.521
Aw, my life can't get any worse.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.223
Hey, at least
you're not getting attacked

14:16.256 --> 14:17.925
by a goose for no reason.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.160
Hey, you got bread, bro?
Give me that bread, bro.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.494
Come on, bro. Bro.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.097
(screams)
Help me, Officer Goosefear!

14:30.770 --> 14:33.573
Guys, from now on,
I need to stand this up

14:33.606 --> 14:35.108
in the middle of your table.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.045
(chuckles)
Pawww yeah!

14:38.078 --> 14:40.047
'Cause he's a dog.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.916
Man, I hate being a sidekick
to this stupid dog.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.552
-Yeah, I can imagine, Peter.
-I doubt you can, Quagmire.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.954
None of you can.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.922
-Well, I think I understand...
-I'm talking, Glenn.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.224
I doubt any of you can begin
to know what it's like

14:51.258 --> 14:52.892
to ride someone's coattails,

14:52.926 --> 14:55.028
to play second fiddle
to some fat idiot,

14:55.062 --> 14:57.097
to constantly be setting up
someone else's...

14:57.130 --> 14:59.899
JOE:
* It's The Joe Show *

14:59.933 --> 15:02.369
* Starring Joe *

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
* Doing all sorts
of Joe things *

15:04.571 --> 15:09.076
* Not your average joe,
and also he can walk. *

15:11.311 --> 15:13.780
PETER: ...just a footnote
to someone else's narrative.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.115
I tell you, this sucks worse

15:15.148 --> 15:17.250
than being a monkey
at Coachella.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.320
Dude, it sucks this year.
There's no good bands.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.957
-There's Bananarama.
-There's, like, one good band.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.629
Hey, Brian, you want
to go to the park?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.098
The public park?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.666
Uh, no, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.801
Because of Beaglemania.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.503
-What?
-My fame.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.739
-That's what they're calling it.
-Who's calling it Beaglemania?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.275
Well, you just did. Catching on.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.277
Well, leave it to you
to ruin it.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.080
Just like Dasani ruined water.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.850
Hey, guys, so you know
how water tastes like nothing?

15:50.883 --> 15:55.788
Well, what if it tasted like
every bottle had a nickel in it?

16:01.528 --> 16:04.131
I want you to sign my chest.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.799
And I want to hawk a loogie
in your face.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.501
(snorts, spits)

16:08.535 --> 16:11.538
I want you to sign my ass.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.274
And I want to hawk a loogie
in your face.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.443
(snorts, spits)

16:16.476 --> 16:18.545
I want you
to autograph my stomach.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.048
Okay, fine, but do me a favor:
don't spit on my friend.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.382
Hey, Brian?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.851
Why don't you mind
your own (bleep) business?

16:27.387 --> 16:30.190
Oh, God, again
with this Beaglemania?

16:30.223 --> 16:32.525
-Where'd you get those T-shirts?
-From Brian.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.461
He says it's really catching on.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.564
-Well, it isn't. It's a joke.
-It's no joke for him, Dad.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.500
He even recorded The Bite Album.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.203
-(cat meowing, dog barking)
-(music playing)
-K-nine. K-nine.

16:43.236 --> 16:47.174
-(wind gusting)
-K-nine. K-nine. K-nine.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.942
K-nine. K-nine.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.315
Coming up, uncomfortable pause

16:55.348 --> 16:57.384
as anchor throws to reporter
in the field.

16:57.417 --> 17:01.020
But first, hey, hungover dads,
want to go to a parade?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.256
Does that sound like fun
on a Sunday morning?

17:03.290 --> 17:05.058
Not just being worried
about your kids,

17:05.092 --> 17:07.160
but everyone else's kids
around you, too?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.462
For more,
here's Tricia Takanawa.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.567
Apparently we've lost Tricia...

17:14.601 --> 17:17.870
Tom, I'm standing here
outside some public toilets

17:17.904 --> 17:20.373
where dads who are really
hurting will be vomiting

17:20.407 --> 17:23.009
in front of their
still-developing children.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.213
The parade is tomorrow,
but already the giant balloons

17:26.246 --> 17:30.117
are being inflated, including
two newcomers this year:

17:30.150 --> 17:32.385
Pepe, the alt-right frog,

17:32.419 --> 17:35.722
and Hops the Dog,
the beloved beer pitchman.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.057
Aw, man.
Brian gets his own balloon?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.059
This can't get any worse.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.730
In fact, Hops is so popular
that hundreds of Quahog women

17:43.763 --> 17:46.533
have volunteered to blow up
his balloon.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.568
(exhaling)

17:52.239 --> 17:55.575
Aw, that's the cashier
at the CVS I like.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.911
ANNOUNCER 1: And here comes
the marching band,

17:58.945 --> 18:01.248
led by baton twirler
Jane Duncan,

18:01.281 --> 18:04.817
whose aunt is famously-thin
actress Bebe Neuwirth.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.953
Jane lists her hobbies
as baton twirling

18:06.986 --> 18:09.422
and trying to contact her aunt.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.424
And, look,
is that the beer mascot

18:11.458 --> 18:12.925
you've all been waiting for?

18:12.959 --> 18:15.895
ANNOUNCER 2:
That's right, it's Hops the Dog.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.931
Stupid Brian. Can't even
wave to the crowd right.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.900
(crowd cheering)

18:20.933 --> 18:23.670
Hi! Thanks for coming out. Hi!

18:23.703 --> 18:25.772
CROWD (chanting):
Hops! Hops! Hops!

18:25.805 --> 18:29.108
Where's Dad?
He's missing this.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.113
Say good-bye, Hops.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.482
HOTEL EMPLOYEE:
Excuse me, sir?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
Are you a guest of the hotel?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.986
I-I, uh...
I'm-I'm just here for an event.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.189
Oh, are you part
of Sarah's bridal brunch?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.690
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.858
Can't-can't believe
she's heading down the aisle.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.195
Well, they're making speeches
in the Santa Fe Lounge.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.397
If you hurry,
you can still get yours in.

18:53.166 --> 18:57.470
Well, Sarah, another turning
point, a fork stuck in the road.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.671
Who is he again?

18:58.705 --> 19:00.773
I think he's that guy
from the funeral.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.809
You know, part of me
is glad Sarah met Henry,

19:02.842 --> 19:05.312
because she and I had a pact
that if neither of us

19:05.345 --> 19:07.314
was married by 40,
we'd get hitched.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.450
And I think you all know
how that would have gone.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.151
(laughter)

19:12.185 --> 19:13.986
Everybody, get down!

19:14.020 --> 19:16.589
(people screaming)

19:19.192 --> 19:21.461
(screaming)

19:21.494 --> 19:23.363
So, to Sarah and Henry.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.366
May they have a long
and happy marriage.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.504
(people screaming)

19:31.538 --> 19:34.507
Tom, I'm standing here
along the parade route

19:34.541 --> 19:37.176
where the Hops balloon
has just been punctured,

19:37.210 --> 19:39.246
and is now raining helium

19:39.279 --> 19:40.413
(high-pitched):
down on the crowd,

19:40.447 --> 19:43.483
creating chaos
and wreaking havoc.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.551
(tires screech)

19:44.584 --> 19:46.219
(high-pitched):
We have an active shooter!

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
I repeat,
we have an active shooter!

19:48.555 --> 19:52.225
I can't stress the seriousness
of this situation enough!

19:56.763 --> 19:58.831
(high-pitched):
This is a disaster!

19:58.865 --> 20:00.333
(high-pitched):
Brian, you're fired.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.369
(high-pitched): What do you
mean? This isn't my fault.

20:02.402 --> 20:06.038
(normal voice): I'm never
drinking this beer again.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.107
My voice is impervious
to helium.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.614
*

20:19.386 --> 20:21.288
What a mess, huh?

20:21.321 --> 20:24.090
Hey, Peter, sorry all that fame
went to my head.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.092
And I'm sorry
I shot your balloon.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.927
How'd you get out
of jail so fast?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.596
I took a hostage.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.598
-It's an ongoing situation.
-(muffled grunting)

20:31.631 --> 20:33.600
(siren whooping)

20:33.633 --> 20:36.569
WOMAN: Honey, close that window
and come to bed.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.871
-In a minute.
-Greg Mitchell,

20:38.905 --> 20:42.141
sometimes I feel like
I married you and that window.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.444
The two of you
are more similar than you think.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.778
And how's that?

20:45.812 --> 20:49.282
Well, for one thing,
you're both a real pane.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.318
(audience laughter, applause)

20:53.786 --> 20:56.456
CHOIR:
* Window. *

21:30.490 --> 21:32.459
