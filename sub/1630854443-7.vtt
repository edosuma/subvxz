00:13.888 --> 00:22.230
[***]

00:24.607 --> 00:26.359
Alba: I have
such a strange sensation.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.332
Batty: Batty is dead.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.752
Alba: I'm glad.

00:43.793 --> 00:44.753
Batty: I don't want you talking

00:44.794 --> 00:45.879
about her anymore

00:45.920 --> 00:47.881
or else I'll have
to kill you too.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.257
Alba: I'm sorry.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.426
Batty: Don't be.
Alba: But I truly am.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.094
I don't like to see you suffer.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.641
Maru: I've been framed.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.771
Alba: I guess
you'll be staying here longer.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.237
Batty: Eventually,
you'll return to your

01:11.279 --> 01:12.781
senses and return to me.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.742
Alba: What is it
about this place

01:15.784 --> 01:18.411
that makes people act so crazy?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.497
Maru: The coast is
where the bandits, the pirates,

01:20.538 --> 01:22.499
and the dancers live.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.168
The sensible people
all move to the interior.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.131
Inocencia: I never did see
the two of you

01:30.173 --> 01:31.633
lasting very long together.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.178
Alba: Not even
to the bottom of the quicksand?

01:35.512 --> 01:38.306
[Cackling]

01:49.734 --> 01:52.821
Maru: No, no! Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

01:52.862 --> 01:54.406
Stop!

01:54.447 --> 01:55.407
You're gonna break his ribs!

01:55.448 --> 01:56.658
Malone: That's the general idea.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.827
[Kicks thrown]

01:58.868 --> 02:01.621
[Max grunting]

02:01.663 --> 02:03.289
Maru: Jesus Christ, Max!

02:04.749 --> 02:07.794
- Don't touch me,
you fuckin' whore!

02:07.836 --> 02:10.422
- Prince Charming
in the flesh.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.507
- I was trying to spare you.
None of it is true.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.552
[Max breathes heavily]

02:16.678 --> 02:18.304
- What the fuck is going on?

02:18.346 --> 02:19.848
- We're being held hostage.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.851
- By Fausto?

02:22.892 --> 02:24.394
- By diamond thieves.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.604
Did you not hear
about the robbery?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.605
- Yeah. The 12 million?

02:27.647 --> 02:28.982
- Uh- huh.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.567
- That was your butler?

02:30.608 --> 02:32.569
- He's not my butler.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.655
- Well, how'd you
get mixed up with him?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.450
[Scoffs] No one's
mixed up with anyone, Max.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.868
Thieves broke in.
Max: Ow!

02:40.994 --> 02:43.538
Why would they pick this place
out of the blue?

02:43.580 --> 02:44.873
- Maybe you can ask them.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.336
[***]

02:50.879 --> 02:52.005
Malone: Since we're gonna
be working together,

02:52.047 --> 02:53.548
let's get something clear.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.966
I have a policy about
not working with people

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
I don't know, but you two
come highly recommended.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.012
Clover: Listen, Malone.
Let me make it real easy...

02:59.054 --> 03:00.472
- Let me finish.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.556
I don't care
that you're a woman,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.516
I don't go for cute shit.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.517
- I don't, either.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.602
- That makes three.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.020
Malone: So I'm not here
to waste time

03:07.062 --> 03:09.439
flirting or holding your hand
or being a gentleman.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.317
The way this works,
and it barely works,

03:12.359 --> 03:14.861
it's because I have a way in,
a way at, and a way out.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.988
- Sir, permission to speak?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
- See?

03:18.073 --> 03:19.574
That's what
I mean about cute shit.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.326
- How's that cute?
Nothing cute about it.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.369
I'm a soldier.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.453
I've never been called
cute before.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.246
Clover: Deal me out.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.873
Sierra: That was quick.
Why?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.500
Clover: Because you two
are already flirting.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.542
Malone: That's not flirting.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.380
- Okay, can we just go back
to three minutes ago?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.340
So I understand
you're a little,

03:35.382 --> 03:37.926
I mean, not threatened
but taken aback by the fact

03:37.967 --> 03:40.387
that unlike your regular
hood hottie, Clover

03:40.428 --> 03:42.347
seems totally clueless
about her fineness

03:42.389 --> 03:44.724
and that I am, in the words
of my Army Lieutenant,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.893
clearly a terrorist's wet dream,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.770
but it doesn't mean we can't
drive or shoot as well

03:48.812 --> 03:51.606
as any fat asshole with
bad breath and thinning hair.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.944
- No more jokes
until after the score.

03:55.985 --> 03:56.945
Sierra: Fine with me.

03:56.986 --> 03:57.779
Clover?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.033
- I'm not a complainer.
Historically.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.703
I'm the platonic ideal
of a good sport.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.414
But what I don't care much for
is being the mediator.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.498
When you're stuck
behind the wheel

04:08.540 --> 04:10.417
more than half the time,
you get hotshots

04:10.458 --> 04:12.419
who are hell- bent on
proving to one another

04:12.460 --> 04:14.629
who's got the biggest dick
and the fastest mouth.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.131
Most of the time,
it's done for the benefit

04:16.172 --> 04:18.758
of the neutral third party
who's stuck in the front seat

04:18.800 --> 04:21.678
like an asshole
minding her own business.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.638
This gets exhausting real quick,

04:23.680 --> 04:25.932
so I'm politely asking you both
to pick a lane.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.183
Fuck or don't fuck.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.935
But please stop trying
to out alpha one another

04:28.977 --> 04:31.104
because it's giving me
a headache.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.648
I don't want to be reminding you
of this for an entire week.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.067
None of it impresses me.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.318
Are we clear?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.783
- Did you just say
platonic ideal?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.120
- I may be a hood hottie,

04:47.162 --> 04:51.958
but you're not the only natural
discussant at the table.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.502
Yes, it is a word.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.464
Look it up.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.342
- Judge, Malone again.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.801
This is the number
your man should call

05:01.843 --> 05:03.011
when he gets to the address.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.638
If he doesn't call first,
I fire first.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.390
Ask questions after.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.893
- Can I talk to you a minute?

05:09.934 --> 05:11.561
- I know what you're gonna say.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.896
- I doubt it.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.105
- I lost my temper
with the pompous little shit,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.607
but you didn't
hear him out there.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.484
- Not what I was gonna say.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.153
- Not in those words maybe,
but I was out of line.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.613
I'm a long way
from happy about it.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.739
- Now what I was gonna say.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.449
- Well, what were you gonna say?

05:24.491 --> 05:25.700
- I was gonna say
your trust problem

05:25.742 --> 05:27.619
is getting in the way
of us moving forward,

05:27.660 --> 05:29.913
and it's jeopardizing
the entire job.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.583
- Okay, I'll play along.
How do we fix it?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.960
- Ten-minute timeout.
You and I.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.007
- When you say timeout...?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.385
- Unless you're wired
to only go for guys.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.138
- No, but time
is a little inconvenient.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.849
Sierra: What's ten minutes
to our cost-time equation?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.393
Maybe not even ten.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.021
- You must've had
the happiest childhood on Earth

05:55.063 --> 05:57.399
to be this confident
about everything.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.609
- If your mood isn't
greatly improved in ten minutes,

05:59.651 --> 06:01.778
then I'm not half the woman
I think I am.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.533
[***]

07:42.045 --> 07:44.047
The lion lies down
with the lamb.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.840
- The fun part is
which is which.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.008
- How'd you like to start?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.885
- Depends, what do you
like to do first?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.595
- Kiss a little
to get in the mood.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.930
What do you usually do?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.140
- I like taking turns,
getting my partner ready.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.517
- We could do that.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.936
- Who goes first?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.147
- You have a coin?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.608
- Rock, paper, scissors?

08:03.650 --> 08:04.776
- Best of three.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.790
So now what?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.125
- I choose what I want,

08:20.166 --> 08:21.167
and you have eight minutes
to knock my socks off.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.168
- Fair is fair.
Lie back.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.795
- That's not what I want.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.047
What I want is for you
to get rid of that knife.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.298
- Mm. You saw that.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.299
- I'm watchful like that.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.300
- It was only a precaution.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.593
Malone: Mm.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.012
You're what's called
a belt-and-suspenders man.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.096
Sierra: A what?

08:33.138 --> 08:35.015
- You're the antithesis
of a gambler,

08:35.056 --> 08:37.100
you refuse to get caught
with your pants down.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.019
And in that way, we're alike.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.855
But you're a killer,
so if you're gonna kill me,

08:41.896 --> 08:43.189
you gotta do it
with your bare hands.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.025
- It's a lot more effort.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.192
- I suppose.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.694
You might get an elbow
to the face.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.237
- And spitting
and biting and scratching.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.613
[Chuckles]
You think I'm a scratcher?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.699
- I think if I gave you
a clear shot of my eyeballs,

08:52.741 --> 08:54.117
you'd scratch
until you clawed them out.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.952
- Oh! That's how you see me?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.078
- I think, given a choice,

08:57.120 --> 08:58.705
you'll try to convince me
to kill Clover

08:58.747 --> 09:02.125
and split the take two ways.
I think that turns you on.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.171
Am I wrong?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.593
I'm not wrong.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.935
[Grunting]

09:40.372 --> 09:42.957
- Hey, how'd you do it?

09:45.543 --> 09:47.962
- Uh, do what?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.214
- Cut the bull.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.174
We're not making it
out of this alive.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.342
- You don't know that.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.551
[Laughs]

09:53.593 --> 09:56.221
- Well, I do.
And if you don't know that,

09:56.262 --> 09:57.931
you haven't been
paying attention.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.057
The cartel will handle this

09:59.099 --> 10:00.475
the way the cartel
handles everything.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.061
So humor me.
How'd you kill him?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.980
- I have no idea
what you're driving at.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.732
[Laughs]

10:07.774 --> 10:10.110
A cuckoo
ex-junkie documentarian

10:10.151 --> 10:12.821
and a mannequin model,
suddenly living together

10:12.862 --> 10:15.281
in their late rich husband's
estate.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.866
Wait, you think
I was born yesterday?

10:16.908 --> 10:18.993
- I think you've been
in television too long.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.829
- I told you it's
a money-laundering scheme.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.498
- Thank you,
my ever-loyal sidekick.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.750
It's no wonder your mother said
you'd never amount to much.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.876
- Let's leave her
out of this.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.211
- Hey, did Lolita tell you

10:28.253 --> 10:30.505
why her mother hasn't spoken
to her in ten years?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.508
- What's it matter if we're not
making it out alive?

10:33.550 --> 10:35.260
- What about you, Inocencia?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.388
Are you part of this too, hmm?

10:38.430 --> 10:39.764
Is she in on it?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.308
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.227
- I read the autopsy,
sweetheart.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.146
Officially, Archie died
of cardiac arrest,

10:46.187 --> 10:49.024
but I know you two killed him.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.568
Let's see, money is the motive,
drowning is the means.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.904
All that's missing is the how.

10:54.946 --> 10:58.408
Now, my guess is
that you two poisoned him

10:58.450 --> 11:00.869
in some clever way that the
half-assed coroner's office

11:00.910 --> 11:02.871
is too incompetent
to figure out,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.205
all of which would have
inevitably bubbled up

11:04.247 --> 11:05.540
in the documentary
after pitting you two

11:05.582 --> 11:07.584
against each other,
likely around hour number...

11:07.625 --> 11:10.879
Uh... four,
but c'est lafucking vie.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.297
So how'd you do it?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.923
- We're not playing this game.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.349
- Archie was my friend.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.225
And I despise
conniving little shits

11:24.267 --> 11:25.435
who think
they can outsmart me.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.354
- And especially
if they have vaginas.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.274
- Coming up next
on our tour of female tragedy,

11:31.316 --> 11:34.444
"Soul-sucking Pathological
Liars with Feelings."

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
- How'd you end up
with this loser?

11:36.488 --> 11:37.614
- Chalk it up

11:37.655 --> 11:39.949
to his irresistibly charming
personality.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.202
- Why is it the more
disposable a woman is,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.537
the more she plays
the woman card.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.042
- Do you really think
I'm disposable?

11:49.084 --> 11:51.127
- Why do you care
what this slimeball thinks?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.046
- Because I believe
I am endowed

11:53.088 --> 11:55.173
with the same capacity for
thought and self-reflection

11:55.215 --> 11:58.176
as anyone,
but maybe not you.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.929
Because you have
a general pity for mankind.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.265
- I'm absolutely fine
with that attitude, angel.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.060
- You and you.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.520
Come with me.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.480
Malone: I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.482
How soon can you get
this boat here?

12:12.524 --> 12:13.608
- It's not my boat.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.984
- I'm only going
to ask you this once.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.320
How soon can you get
this boat here?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.322
- Twenty minutes.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.074
- If in 21 minutes
this boat is not here,

12:21.116 --> 12:23.201
I will blow your balls off.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.536
Any questions?

12:36.006 --> 12:37.007
- Roberto.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.011
Maru: I'm sorry.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.515
He was always so obnoxious
whenever he came into the club.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.225
I was at a low point.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.519
I'd just gotten fired
for biting my boss's finger

12:49.561 --> 12:53.523
after he pointed it too close
to my face yelling at me.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.277
I stormed outside
and Max was getting in his car.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.237
I didn't even really
want to fuck him.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.447
Well, I kind of
wanted to fuck him

13:00.488 --> 13:01.656
but I also wanted to die.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.993
So it's been downhill
from there.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.453
- What happened
with your mother?

13:08.580 --> 13:09.581
- Misunderstanding.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.170
I may have slept
with her husband.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.049
- You're not sure?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.091
- Not entirely.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.969
- Were you sleepwalking?

13:24.262 --> 13:27.599
[Chuckles]
- I was really high.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.354
When I was a kid, I used
to catch bugs and lizards.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.356
And when I would
set them free,

13:34.397 --> 13:36.399
they would sort of stand there
for a minute, anesthetized,

13:36.441 --> 13:38.068
not knowing what to do.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.613
That's pretty much how I felt
from 15 to 20.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.573
I was fried, I was anxious,

13:43.615 --> 13:45.283
and I had no idea
where I was going,

13:45.325 --> 13:48.328
but I wasn't ready to grow up.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.164
All around me, my friends
were banging on about no GMOs,

13:51.206 --> 13:52.957
and all organic,
and free-range,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.417
while still blowing
rows of cocaine

13:54.459 --> 13:56.753
off the back of toilet seats.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.172
There was some cognitive
dissonance there

13:59.214 --> 14:02.050
I had a tricky time
reconciling.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.636
I didn't really know anyone
who wasn't on drugs.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.348
But I admit it,
it was all my fault.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.103
He was a lawyer
with a side business

14:13.144 --> 14:16.606
and, uh, he paid me
to act as a mule,

14:16.648 --> 14:19.192
packing heroin in johnnies

14:19.234 --> 14:21.778
and moving them
across the country.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.406
Wasn't one of his better ideas.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.325
I knew he found me
wildly attractive

14:27.367 --> 14:29.369
and I kept flirting with him.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.998
Broke my mom's heart
when she walked in on us.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.459
I was 17.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.253
- You were just a child.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.465
- I don't know about you
but I was a cruel child.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.554
- You had to swallow them,
the rubbers?

14:47.595 --> 14:50.682
- No. There are other places
to hide them.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.147
[***]

14:59.482 --> 15:00.567
- Oh, that's perfect.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.527
Really perfect.
Alright, thanks.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.450
[***]

15:16.791 --> 15:18.626
[muffled groans]

15:25.383 --> 15:27.135
Malone: To whom it may concern,

15:27.177 --> 15:30.347
if you're reading this,
you already didn't do as told.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.224
You were supposed to call first
or get shot.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.769
That means you're all
out of mistakes for today.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.229
What you're going to do now
is walk outside,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.523
past the pool, and stand
between the two lines

15:40.565 --> 15:42.609
with the money you brought.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.362
Dial the number
Ray told you to call.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.281
We will give you instructions
for the handoff.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.825
You do exactly
what we tell you,

15:50.867 --> 15:52.744
and everyone walks out alive.

15:55.997 --> 15:59.584
[***]

15:59.626 --> 16:02.462
[Birds squawking]

16:04.339 --> 16:13.348
[***]

16:31.574 --> 16:40.583
[***]

16:56.433 --> 16:59.519
Does everyone
have a demonic side?

17:00.562 --> 17:02.313
What would happen if
we were not beholden

17:02.355 --> 17:05.275
to the moral limits
of the society we live in?

17:06.317 --> 17:10.572
What if we all followed
our most intimate obsessions

17:10.613 --> 17:12.657
on the regular?

17:14.576 --> 17:15.785
Max: Max Hammond here, folks.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.871
Now, my initial idea
to launch this network

17:17.912 --> 17:19.998
was to show you exactly
how these spider women

17:20.040 --> 17:21.374
got away with murder.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.542
Pit them against one another

17:22.584 --> 17:24.336
and watch their pyramid
of cards tumble

17:24.377 --> 17:26.713
in a flurry of blatant lies.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.257
But that's chicken feed
against our new backdrop:

17:29.299 --> 17:31.885
a world-class diamond heist

17:31.926 --> 17:33.887
with yours truly
caught in the middle.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.890
What you will witness
is television history.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.476
My name is Max Hammond,
and I flirt with danger.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.645
[Grunting and straining]

17:45.648 --> 17:47.359
Batty: Here I am, Holy One.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.736
Alone and abandoned.
I am a murderess.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.739
Filled with selfish thoughts.
Am I even human?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.282
I don't feel much.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.910
I am worthless, I am nothing,
I don't deserve to live.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.037
I have no capacity
for thinking of others.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.413
Well, except for Alba,

18:00.455 --> 18:02.624
but that is only proof
of my lack of conscience.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.709
Of my weakness.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.960
Alba: Here I am,
about to get killed

18:06.002 --> 18:07.420
over stupid diamonds,
and all I can think of

18:07.462 --> 18:09.923
is this infuriating
creature next to me.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.925
She reconfigured
all of my atoms

18:11.966 --> 18:14.052
and now she's acting aloof.

18:14.094 --> 18:18.056
Could true love last
only one night and day?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.850
I finally get why men
find women confusing.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.936
Maru: Why is my clit throbbing?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
There's like
a little antenna down there

18:24.479 --> 18:26.773
that loves really
loud thumping bass.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.983
I don't know when exactly
I first noticed

18:29.025 --> 18:30.944
but it's definitely
a thing with me.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.113
But I'm not
in a dance club right now,

18:33.154 --> 18:34.906
so what the fuck gives?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.413
[Waves rushing]

18:41.454 --> 18:44.582
[Insects chirping]

18:52.090 --> 18:54.676
[***]

19:11.568 --> 19:12.569
- We still have signal?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.992
- It's like a damn cell phone
ad, the signal's so strong.

19:20.744 --> 19:25.957
[***]

19:35.592 --> 19:36.926
- Clover.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.137
Clover, get us out of here now.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.685
Clover!
Start the engine!

19:45.727 --> 19:46.978
[Breathes heavily]

19:47.020 --> 19:49.731
- It's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna cover you.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.997
[Gunshot]

20:06.039 --> 20:09.959
[Gasps]
- Fuck. Fuck.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.002
Oh, my God!

20:13.880 --> 20:16.883
[Hyperventilating]

20:40.323 --> 20:41.658
[Clicking]

20:57.090 --> 20:59.884
