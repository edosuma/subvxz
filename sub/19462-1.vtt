00:44.177 --> 00:47.408
Larry!
Jimmy!

02:17.003 --> 02:18.732
That's very good.
Good.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.630
- How much is it?
- Two dollars.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.088
There's 1.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.915
There's 2.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.796
Thank you.

03:14.661 --> 03:18.256
- It's locked.
- He's in there again.

03:18.865 --> 03:24.030
Pa! What are you doing in there?
Open up this door.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.831
You better not be doing
what I think you're doing.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.632
Hey!

03:29.409 --> 03:31.104
I told you,
I make that for peddling.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.279
Not for you to drink.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.778
Hey, you show some respect.

03:42.789 --> 03:46.384
Larry! Jimmy!
You all get on to the house.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.390
Supper's ready.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.605
Why did you hit him?

04:00.807 --> 04:04.573
- He was drinking my profits.
- You can't be so ornery.

04:04.777 --> 04:07.678
- People'll think you're crazy.
- No.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.713
I'm just trying to make an honest buck.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.752
- Larry.
- I'll call you back, Mama.

04:52.725 --> 04:56.217
Give a big,
big hand to Ilanis...

04:56.429 --> 04:59.193
from Ottawa, Tennessee.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.634
Thank you, Jimmy.
You know...

05:05.838 --> 05:08.500
I don't know if you feel
the way I do right now...

05:08.708 --> 05:11.871
but we deliver the finest
ladies in southern Ohio.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.773
Don't you think?

05:15.048 --> 05:20.213
Thank you. And now,
please give a warm, warm welcome...

05:20.720 --> 05:23.848
to Kimberly and Melissa.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.959
They're all the way here from
Paris and London, Kentucky.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.602
So how are we doing?

05:46.446 --> 05:49.745
- Bad.
- What do you mean, bad?

05:49.949 --> 05:52.349
- I mean we're broke.
- How can we be broke, Larry?

05:52.552 --> 05:56.113
Well, you know, these giveaways
are killing us. The limousine.

05:56.322 --> 06:00.258
The smorgasbord was a stupid idea.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.123
Then all your buddies are coming
here every night drinking for free.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.060
You don't have to bring
my friends into this.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.757
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, Larry, we're ready to go.

06:09.969 --> 06:14.736
You put forth some hard work.
Thank you. Thank you.

06:14.941 --> 06:19.275
Ilanis, I'll be by in about an hour,
and I'll bring the Ping-Pong balls.

06:19.479 --> 06:23.040
Leticia, I'll see you in two hours.

06:24.083 --> 06:27.883
Hey, Leticia, I liked the way you
blew that candle out tonight.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.187
There's the secret, there.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.760
If I could just somehow let people
know what great lays these girls are...

06:35.962 --> 06:37.987
we'd have something.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.891
Larry, you can't advertise that.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.263
I know you can't, but...

06:48.708 --> 06:50.300
Jimmy...

06:51.444 --> 06:53.844
Mister, what kind of business is this?

06:54.046 --> 06:57.106
Well, now,
I run the Hustler go-go clubs.

06:57.316 --> 07:00.410
- I'm sure you've heard of them.
- No.

07:00.953 --> 07:04.150
Yeah, well, see,
now that's why I need a newsletter.

07:04.424 --> 07:08.190
I figured we'd run maybe, eight,
10 pages per issue.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.324
With nothing but nudie pictures?

07:11.531 --> 07:15.467
Yeah, on this nice,
smooth paper like this.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.034
- That's called "slick."
- Slick, yeah.

07:18.237 --> 07:22.173
But I could get in trouble printing these.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.742
- Why?
- Because there are laws.

07:25.978 --> 07:29.573
You gotta have some sort
of text like Playboy does.

07:32.251 --> 07:36.745
- God will punish the sinner!
- God will punish the sinner!

07:39.425 --> 07:42.758
Thank you all for coming
to my establishment.

07:42.962 --> 07:48.093
And keep in mind, we welcome
Christians in here too. Thank you.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.582
What do you think?

08:06.886 --> 08:09.116
Well, how much did it cost?

08:10.723 --> 08:13.283
Would you forget the
money for one second?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.051
What do you think?

08:15.294 --> 08:17.592
Well, what I think depends
on how much it cost.

08:18.498 --> 08:23.333
Look, there it is,
the first Hustler newsletter.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.471
It's all for the man on the go,
man about town.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.435
Here it is,
news service.

08:28.641 --> 08:33.601
Larry, it's a magazine, not a newsletter.
How you gonna pay for that?

08:35.381 --> 08:38.373
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking, okay?

08:38.717 --> 08:41.380
Let's hear it for Camille.
You were wonderful.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.282
Let's welcome to the
stage, gentlemen...

08:43.489 --> 08:47.187
Calamity Jane from Moscow, Texas.
Let's hear it for her.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.737
Who is that?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.333
That's the new girl.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.211
She got the moves,
don't she?

09:44.984 --> 09:46.849
She ain't bad.

09:47.954 --> 09:52.050
- She ain't legal either.
- Yes, she is legal. I saw her ID.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.092
Look, you stupid briarhopper,
my dog could get an ID...

09:56.295 --> 09:57.990
from my goat.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.778
Hey, listen...

10:14.981 --> 10:19.611
when she gets done up there,
send her on up to my office.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.762
What?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.958
What's your name?

10:38.137 --> 10:41.072
- Jane.
- Jane?

10:41.273 --> 10:44.606
- We have a policy in this club.
- Oh, yeah?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.778
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.209
Okay, and?

10:49.749 --> 10:56.120
Trouble is, I have a sneaking
suspicion that you're not of age.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.250
You know,
this could cost me my liquor license.

11:00.459 --> 11:04.293
I could have to close up
shop and fire a lot of people.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.431
- I'll tell you something.
- Please.

11:06.632 --> 11:10.090
Yeah, well,
see this?

11:10.302 --> 11:11.929
See that?
That?

11:12.138 --> 11:16.040
I am this far, one second,
one millimeter...

11:16.242 --> 11:18.972
one second from being legal.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.838
So I'm gonna have to
ask you to come back...

11:22.048 --> 11:24.778
when you're...
When that centimeter's up.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.817
Well, that would be
tomorrow morning, then.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.316
I like the way you dance.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.395
What's that?

11:39.598 --> 11:43.694
Just a little something
I got from down home.

11:43.903 --> 11:48.203
You're a classy guy.
I've heard about you.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.271
This is moonshine. Is that?
Is this moonshine, right?

11:54.313 --> 11:58.841
- It's okay. It's just from potatoes.
- What's it gonna do to me?

11:59.085 --> 12:01.019
Go ahead.
It's fine. Natural.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.327
But step away from the desk,
will you?

12:11.163 --> 12:13.063
That's like fire!

12:17.203 --> 12:19.797
- Sorry I made a mess.
- It's okay.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.898
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.094
I heard a story that you've slept with

12:26.095 --> 12:28.444
every single girl in
every one of your clubs.

12:28.647 --> 12:34.210
Sort of a prerequisite.
I'm just wondering if that's true or not.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.816
Well, you know, it ain't entirely untrue,
if that's what you mean.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.461
I'm just curious why you
haven't taken a stab at me.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.236
I just met you five minutes ago.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.997
I think it was six.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.174
Tick, tick, tick...

13:18.864 --> 13:22.027
- Come on, one more time.
- One more time?

13:22.234 --> 13:25.465
Come on, Althea,
even Superman has his limits.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.835
That's the problem with you,
you know, men. You know?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.101
Your batteries run out.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.576
Because we women,
our batteries never run out.

13:35.781 --> 13:40.445
- We can go on and on and on.
- Well, then, go fuck a woman.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.419
"Then, go fuck a woman."
I do fuck women.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.257
Excuse me?

13:46.926 --> 13:49.417
You are not the only
person in this club...

13:49.628 --> 13:52.096
to have had every single
woman in this club.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.926
After one night,
she's moving in with you?

13:56.468 --> 13:58.629
Well, you know, this girl,
she had it rough.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.466
- Grew up in an orphanage.
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.937
Hey. Are you that guy
in that little sex paper?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.009
- Could be. - I love the pictures.
How do I subscribe?

14:10.249 --> 14:12.581
Where did you come
upon the newsletter?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.946
Found it in a bathroom in a gas station.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.349
Came in pretty handy.

14:17.656 --> 14:23.185
Well, I'm glad we helped you out, but,
you know, it ain't for subscription.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.989
This guy.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.324
- Game one, steel-curtain defense...
- Chips?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.969
- never gave the Bengals a chance.
- Chips?

14:44.583 --> 14:46.467
Look at her tits. They're nice.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.384
They're nice tits,
but they don't look real.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.126
- I don't understand this magazine.
- Look at her butt.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.817
Fuzzy pictures, articles...

14:57.029 --> 14:59.759
but I don't know what the
hell they're talking about.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.331
You guys read Playboy?

15:03.669 --> 15:05.694
- Well, yeah.
- Sure. - Yeah.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.405
Did you...?
Excuse me, baby.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.701
Did you enjoy this month's article...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.847
on how to hook up your
quadraphonic stereo system?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.843
I think I missed that one.

15:20.619 --> 15:25.181
And did you follow their advice on
how to make a perfect martini?

15:25.391 --> 15:29.350
- Larry, come on, man, move over.
- Who is this magazine for anyway?

15:29.561 --> 15:34.464
I mean, you know, if... It's like,
if you don't make 20,000 plus a year...

15:34.667 --> 15:37.227
you don't jerk off.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.867
Seven million people buying it,
and nobody's reading it.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.702
Gentlemen, Playboy is mocking you.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.780
- Give me a jelly doughnut, will you?
- Yeah, I got your jelly.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.184
How many pages do we
have right now, exactly?

15:59.391 --> 16:01.382
- We have 105.
- That's no good.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.494
- Why not?
- 106 is good. 104, that's good.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.631
- 105...
- You connected with these numbers?

16:06.832 --> 16:08.629
No, it's gotta be an even number.

16:08.834 --> 16:13.032
Because a paper's got two sides, right?
That's two. Multiples of two.

16:13.238 --> 16:17.538
No, a page has four. Four.
It's like four. It's one, two, three, four.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.973
- You fold it, put the staple.
- That's it.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.239
- It's not even an even number.
- That's right.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.610
We'll get it figured out.
We'll ask Larry.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.546
What the hell's he doing?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.450
Baby, let me see that
flower in your left hand.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.626
No, not that one.
Your other left hand.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.163
- Yeah, that's it.
- What...? Hey, hey, hey.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.962
Look, you know, we're not
running a flower shop here, okay?

16:45.170 --> 16:48.333
We're selling the girl.
Stop futzing around with the props...

16:48.540 --> 16:52.704
and the pillows and the flowers,
and just shoot the girl. Okay?

16:52.911 --> 16:55.778
Okay, now,
let's go for that leg thing here.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.506
Let's recline a little.
Yeah.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.981
Let's see you open up
them legs a little bit.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.154
Now give me a little wider.
That's it.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.915
Now give me a little wider.
A little wider.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.954
Just another little touch wider.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.291
- No, baby, not quite that wide.
- Wait, wait, wait.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.934
No. That... Get back to that.
That's exactly what we want.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.398
Here.
Okay, that's perfect.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.435
Leave it right there.
That's what you want.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.938
A woman's vagina has as
much personality as her face.

17:24.143 --> 17:27.874
- But you can't show the genitalia.
- Why not?

17:28.079 --> 17:29.945
Well, Larry,
Rudy's right.

17:30.149 --> 17:33.118
- You can't legally show the vagina.
- Hey, shut up, Jimmy.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.788
- Rudy, are you a religious man?
- Yeah.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.653
- Okay, you believe God created man?
- Yeah.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.728
- God created woman.
- Yeah.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.900
Well, then surely the same
God created her vagina.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.195
And who are you to defy God?
Just shoot her!

18:09.888 --> 18:12.584
Jesus Christ.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.860
Where is she?

18:20.899 --> 18:25.996
Althea!
Hey, baby. Hey.

18:27.172 --> 18:32.542
Happy birthday, baby.
And I have a heart from my heart.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.115
Larry, that's beautiful.

18:42.387 --> 18:45.515
- What's wrong?
- The distributor called...

18:45.724 --> 18:49.956
and unfortunately, we've had
only a 25 percent sell-through.

18:50.162 --> 18:53.222
Somebody want to
translate that for me?

18:53.832 --> 18:57.734
What that means is,
they're sending back 150,000 copies.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.131
That's what it means.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.873
- Shit!
- You're a stupid, dumb briarhopper.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.431
What made you think you'd
pull it off anyway later?

19:09.432 --> 19:10.879
At least he has balls, Jimmy.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.110
- Yeah, well, what he needs is brains.
- Oh, God, Einstein's speaking.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.651
I'm so impressed.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.490
- One more issue and we're wiped out?
- Yeah.

19:21.693 --> 19:25.959
You said yourself,
"It's not so bad to be poor."

19:26.165 --> 19:28.725
Hey, fuck you, Althea.
You go be poor, okay?

19:29.301 --> 19:31.599
Fuck me?
I believe you're the one...

19:31.803 --> 19:35.068
that got us into this
debt in the first place.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.933
You think just because it's your
birthday that you can be a bitch?

19:40.145 --> 19:44.081
Yeah, and I think I'm 50 feet tall
and you have a needle dick, okay?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.251
Don't ever hit me like that again.
Don't talk to me like that.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.356
Don't hit me like that.
I'll go back.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.357
I'll go back,
and I'll eat dog food, okay? Dog food.

19:56.562 --> 20:00.089
You know, take this. I don't own
this anymore. I don't have one.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.494
Throw it out in the street.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.635
Mr. Flynt,
we have a guy on the phone from Italy.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.327
He claims he has naked
pictures of Jackie O.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.436
Put him through.
Yeah, hello.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.504
- You the photographer?
- Right, yeah.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.009
- What do you got?
- Is this Mr. Flynt?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.647
Yeah, this is Mr. Flynt.

20:16.848 --> 20:21.376
Listen, I was watching that
damn island for four months...

20:21.587 --> 20:24.215
and then one day, man,
cabana door opens...

20:24.423 --> 20:27.324
and out comes Jackie
O with nothing on.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.552
- I mean, not a single stitch.
- You sure it's Jackie O?

20:30.762 --> 20:32.992
Yeah, sure.

20:33.198 --> 20:36.099
- And what do you see?
- You see absolutely everything.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.893
Trust me.
And she's a good one.

20:38.103 --> 20:41.334
This ain't no Mamie
Eisenhower or Lady Bird.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.298
Oh, my God.
First pussy.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.479
Everyone's talking about
local-boy done good...

20:48.680 --> 20:49.772
- Hey!
- What?

20:49.982 --> 20:53.509
Larry Flynt, whose Hustler magazine
has reached national sales...

20:53.719 --> 20:57.519
of an astonishing 2 million copies.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.590
- And in a stunning disclosure...
- Move your ass!

21:00.792 --> 21:04.228
WGBE-TV has learned that Ohio
Governor Jim Rhodes, himself...

21:04.429 --> 21:09.594
was spotted at a newsstand buying a
copy of the infamous Jackie O issue.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.894
- I spoke to the governor today...
- Move it!

21:12.104 --> 21:14.095
and he had this response:

21:14.306 --> 21:18.242
Everybody knows I've been a historical
buff about first ladies for a long time.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.742
Are you saying you'd be interested in
nude photos of Martha Washington?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.341
- She's a little bit before my time.
- Arlo!

21:24.549 --> 21:27.211
What about nude photos of your wife?

21:27.919 --> 21:31.116
A teacher educates our children...

21:31.323 --> 21:34.520
and they become model citizens.

21:34.726 --> 21:39.322
The clergyman preaches,
and we find spirituality.

21:39.665 --> 21:43.795
My bank gives loans,
and homes get built.

21:44.002 --> 21:50.339
But now there's a new,
darker influence in Cincinnati.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.974
Mr. Leis,
if you would?

21:57.316 --> 22:01.685
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that
you review this material carefully.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.445
It's important you know...

22:03.655 --> 22:08.388
that I did not buy these at a smut store.

22:10.462 --> 22:15.490
These were not purchased
at a dirty book shop.

22:18.236 --> 22:22.434
I bought this in a
neighborhood grocery store...

22:22.674 --> 22:27.611
in full view of our children.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.213
Ma'am, you cannot hide from this.

22:32.317 --> 22:36.447
Decent people are being corrupted.

22:36.655 --> 22:39.419
Why, just look what happened
to our fine governor.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.484
As members of the citizens
for decent literature...

22:44.696 --> 22:46.596
we cannot relent.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.899
We must prevent the destruction...

22:51.103 --> 22:53.970
of the soul of our country.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.556
- Larry.
- Yeah?

23:21.266 --> 23:22.631
Take off your pants.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.730
- What?
- Take off your pants.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.236
- Why?
- Because...

23:29.441 --> 23:32.842
I never fucked a millionaire before.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.241
Look at that.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.965
Happy birthday, America!

24:13.251 --> 24:15.845
This is Larry's house?

24:16.054 --> 24:18.818
- Ma. Pa.
- Must be it.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.956
- My son.
- Hey. You came.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.855
- It's so big.
- Hey, Larry.

24:24.196 --> 24:29.099
- Larry, who are all these people?
- Well, these are my friends, Ma.

24:29.301 --> 24:33.294
- You have so many friends.
- Lots of money, lots of friends.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.936
- Look at you.
- Hey, Arlo.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.411
- You know how many
rooms I have here? - No.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.808
Twenty-four rooms.
Know who else has 24 rooms?

24:44.015 --> 24:45.573
- The president?
- Hugh Hefner.

24:46.351 --> 24:50.082
This is the best room in the house.
I think you're gonna like it.

24:50.288 --> 24:53.280
"This is the best room in the house,"
he said.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.389
You know,
there's a maid still cleaning up in there.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.030
Let me just say a word.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.390
The maid's cleaning up in there.
He's got...

25:02.601 --> 25:06.503
Listen, my folks are here,
so just move the girls into the Jacuzzi...

25:06.705 --> 25:09.265
- and I'll get with you later.
- Your folks are here?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.586
What in the world is that?

25:28.326 --> 25:31.591
- Hey, ladies.
- Larry!

25:32.097 --> 25:34.327
The party is just beginning.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.532
She's nice...

25:40.739 --> 25:43.037
and she's frigid.

25:44.676 --> 25:48.077
Have to see what we can do about that.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.271
One, two...

26:21.913 --> 26:24.313
- Larry.
- Yeah?

26:24.816 --> 26:27.250
Do you ever think
about getting married?

26:28.153 --> 26:32.021
Oh, God. You know,
there's nothing more certain...

26:32.223 --> 26:35.056
to ruin a beautiful
relationship than marriage.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.018
As soon as you get that ring
around the finger, okay...

26:39.431 --> 26:42.264
suddenly you have an
ownership situation.

26:42.467 --> 26:46.028
Prior to that,
it's friendly.

26:46.237 --> 26:49.729
You're kind to each other.
And I'll tell you something.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.602
As much as I love you...

26:51.943 --> 26:56.778
I want a variety of
different... Vagina, pussy.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.847
- I'm...
- What did we just do?

26:59.050 --> 27:01.245
- That's what I'm talking about.
- What am I?

27:01.453 --> 27:05.048
So do you think I'm
talking about monogamy?

27:05.256 --> 27:08.089
- You think I'm talking...
- You're not talking about monogamy?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.420
No, of course not.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.598
Larry, how could you
misunderstand me?

27:13.798 --> 27:15.698
I was wondering,
because I thought...

27:15.900 --> 27:18.698
I don't wanna get married
and stop the way we live.

27:19.070 --> 27:24.235
The way that we live is great.
Nothing would change. My God.

27:24.442 --> 27:29.243
- Why? Why now?
- Because I only wanna be with you.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.174
You're the only man I wanna be with.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.319
I want this ring on my finger...

27:35.520 --> 27:39.616
to tell me that you love
me above all other women.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.588
- You want a ceremony?
- I wanna go to a church.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.455
- We'll pay the...
- I want a preacher.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.290
Pay the preacher on the way in...

27:46.498 --> 27:50.662
and we'll get a cash-ectomy
from the lawyer on the way out.

27:51.202 --> 27:54.729
You are my life.

27:54.973 --> 27:59.000
- You're my life. I'm here...
- You're my life too.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.576
- for the rest of my life.
- Right now, my life.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.941
I can't speak for 20 years down the line.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.946
- I can.
- You can?

28:06.151 --> 28:08.381
- Yeah.
- Let me say something, all right?

28:08.586 --> 28:09.848
- Oh, man.
- No, no, no.

28:10.055 --> 28:13.354
Just forget I brought it up.
Larry, just forget I brought it up.

28:13.558 --> 28:17.119
Listen to what I'm saying, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.498
Would you marry me?

28:22.100 --> 28:26.127
- It's not funny, a joke like that.
- I'm not joking. Would you marry me?

28:26.337 --> 28:30.637
Would you do me the honor
of becoming Mrs. Larry Flynt?

28:32.177 --> 28:36.204
You're not fucking with me?
You mean it?

28:36.414 --> 28:39.076
- No, I'm just kidding.
- You are?

28:39.284 --> 28:41.844
- No, I'm serious. I'm serious.
- Don't.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.710
- She's got a dick.
- She taped this on.

29:06.945 --> 29:09.209
Taped this on.
This is not real.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.975
- Who would want to see that anyway?
- I do. I think it's genius.

29:13.184 --> 29:18.053
It don't matter. It's like when people
slow down at a car crash to peek.

29:18.256 --> 29:22.192
- We're breaking taboos.
- How about The Wizard of Oz?

29:22.494 --> 29:26.191
- What do you mean?
- Okay, like, Dorothy is laying there...

29:26.397 --> 29:32.768
in Kansas, and there's the Tin
Man and the Scarecrow and...

29:33.738 --> 29:35.171
- Who's the other one?
- The Lion.

29:35.373 --> 29:38.399
The Lion.
And they're all gang-banging her.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.909
And there's Toto, maybe, even.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.549
Althea, I think there's, you know,
some things are sacred.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.513
Shut up.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.245
Althea, that is the best
damn idea I ever heard.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.445
- Yeah.
- It can work.

29:52.657 --> 29:55.626
- Where can I find Larry Flynt?
- Work it out. What is it?

29:55.827 --> 29:58.125
Yeah, the Tin Man
could have a tin penis.

29:58.329 --> 30:03.460
No, he's got that hat, like a funnel.
You know, he's got that funnel hat.

30:06.104 --> 30:09.369
Larry Claxton Flynt?
Larry Claxton Flynt!

30:09.741 --> 30:11.368
- Yeah.
- Stand up, please, sir.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.441
- Hands behind your back.
- What's this all about?

30:13.645 --> 30:16.637
You're under arrest on charges of
pandering obscenity in Cincinnati...

30:16.848 --> 30:20.045
- and engaging in organized crime.
- Organized crime?

30:20.251 --> 30:22.947
Sit down, lady. You two, shut up.
You have the right to remain silent.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.452
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.888
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one...

30:29.093 --> 30:30.321
one will be appointed.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.231
Mr. Flynt?

30:38.203 --> 30:40.137
You Larry Flynt?

30:40.471 --> 30:44.168
- Who are you?
- Alan Isaacman. I'm your lawyer.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.673
I got bail taken care of.
Don't worry about that.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.312
We ought to talk about the
case when you've rested.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.972
- Wait, wait. Who hired you?
- Your wife hired me.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.652
- My wife?
- Yeah.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.879
Are you doing her?

30:58.656 --> 31:01.386
Wai... Am I...?
Am I what?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.217
I'm just kidding.
I like you.

31:03.428 --> 31:06.192
Give me a call after you
get out of law school.

31:06.397 --> 31:09.161
- No, I'm out of law school.
- What are you, 22?

31:09.367 --> 31:12.894
27. Harvard Law School. Three
years in the public defender's office.

31:13.104 --> 31:16.267
Mr. Flynt, obviously you can get
whoever you want to represent you...

31:16.474 --> 31:19.568
but at least let me say
one thing to you, okay?

31:20.278 --> 31:21.506
How should I...?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.773
You're pretty far out there,
even for guys who do this stuff.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.952
Okay?
I am interested in your case.

31:28.152 --> 31:31.212
The problem you've got is
definitely what I know best.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.413
And I am good at what I do.

31:33.625 --> 31:38.392
- What, do you specialize in porn?
- No, no. I don't specialize in porn.

31:38.596 --> 31:42.088
I'll be perfectly honest.
I don't particularly like what you do.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.824
I specialize in civil liberties.

31:44.035 --> 31:47.493
You know, I don't understand
why they've singled me out.

31:47.705 --> 31:51.869
Look, Mr. Flynt, this case is bigger
than just you and your magazine.

31:52.076 --> 31:55.204
In your case, what's more troubling
is this organized-crime charge.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.711
Organized crime?
Larry's not in the mob.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.408
Mr. Flynt,
I gotta ask you one time.

32:00.618 --> 32:03.382
Do you have any connections
to organized crime?

32:03.588 --> 32:06.921
Absolutely not.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.251
Gotta ask.

32:08.459 --> 32:12.395
- By the way, call me Larry.
- All right, Larry.

32:12.597 --> 32:16.124
In that case, Larry,
this is a completely bullshit charge.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.825
But we have to take this seriously.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.336
Because you could conceivably
be looking at seven to 25 years.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.303
Twenty-five years?

32:24.509 --> 32:26.704
All I'm guilty of is bad taste.

32:26.911 --> 32:29.471
My cousin Bobby shot
a preacher in the back.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.809
- He got six months for it.
- Bobby shot a preacher?

32:33.017 --> 32:34.746
- You didn't know?
- What denomination?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.580
- Baptist.
- I always liked that kid.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.451
Can we discuss Cousin Bobby later?
We need to discuss this case seriously.

32:40.658 --> 32:43.058
- If you want my advice...
- I'm serious. I'm taking notes.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.976
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.413
Before we begin...

33:02.613 --> 33:07.346
I must apologize for the
unpleasantness of this task.

33:08.786 --> 33:13.723
What you're about to see is
going to take your breath away.

33:14.492 --> 33:18.360
Hustler magazine depicts
men and women...

33:18.563 --> 33:19.928
posed together...

33:20.131 --> 33:23.828
in a lewd and shameful manner.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.134
Hustler depicts women and women...

33:29.340 --> 33:32.901
posed together in a lewd
and shameful manner.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.838
Hustler magazine depicts Santa Claus...

33:37.348 --> 33:40.806
posed in a lewd and shameful manner.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.510
What's he talking about?

33:46.657 --> 33:48.989
Jesus Christ, Larry.

33:51.562 --> 33:55.658
Your Honor, the defense would
like to introduce into evidence...

33:55.867 --> 33:59.496
27 other men's magazines
sold in the Cincinnati area.

33:59.704 --> 34:03.003
- Titles such as Penthouse, Playboy...
- Objection!

34:03.975 --> 34:05.943
Sustained.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.139
Sustained?

34:09.080 --> 34:12.014
Wait a second, wait a second.
Your Honor, if I may.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.614
These magazines...

34:14.819 --> 34:18.186
contain material that is virtually
identical to Hustler magazine.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.880
If these magazines are legal
and Hustler is not legal...

34:22.092 --> 34:24.527
then this is clearly a case
of selective prosecution.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.159
No.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.960
I'm sorry.
Did you say no?

34:29.167 --> 34:33.536
I will not allow them into evidence, Sir.
They're irrelevant to this case.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.768
But they are not irrelevant,
they are not irrelevant.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.799
They very clearly demonstrate
the community standard...

34:38.009 --> 34:39.533
- which is laid out...
- No! counsel!

34:39.744 --> 34:42.610
The jury is representative
of community standards...

34:42.813 --> 34:46.648
not a pile of magazines.
I won't admit them.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.681
You won't admit them.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.010
Mr. Flynt...

34:51.222 --> 34:54.123
would you please turn to page 77?

34:58.162 --> 35:00.153
Would you describe to the jury...

35:00.364 --> 35:03.162
what is on page 77, please, sir?

35:03.935 --> 35:07.098
It's a picture of Santa Claus.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.202
What is Santa Claus doing?

35:09.407 --> 35:13.537
He's talking to Mrs. Claus
and holding in his hand...

35:13.744 --> 35:17.942
what appears to be a large,
erect penis.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.911
And would you read the caption
under that cartoon, please?

35:22.820 --> 35:23.878
It says:

35:24.088 --> 35:27.114
"This is what I've got to ho, ho,
ho about."

35:27.325 --> 35:30.226
Mr. Flynt,
do you think...

35:30.428 --> 35:33.363
the Founding Fathers had a
cartoon like this in mind...

35:33.564 --> 35:35.998
when they wrote the First
Amendment of our great constitution?

35:36.200 --> 35:38.576
Well, no, but I don't
think they necessarily had

35:38.577 --> 35:41.001
Playboy in mind or People
either for that matter...

35:41.205 --> 35:44.197
because I saw a couple of four-letter
words in there few weeks back.

35:44.709 --> 35:48.372
But isn't a community allowed
to set its own standards?

35:48.713 --> 35:51.876
No.
That's just a disguise for censorship.

35:52.383 --> 35:56.410
This country belongs to me as
much as it belongs to you, Mr. Leis.

35:56.621 --> 35:59.590
And if you don't like Hustler magazine,
don't read it.

35:59.924 --> 36:00.913
I don't.

36:01.125 --> 36:03.405
But what about the innocent children who

36:03.406 --> 36:06.028
gaze upon your magazine
in our grocery stores?

36:06.230 --> 36:08.698
Well, look...

36:09.167 --> 36:12.898
you know, if a kid gets caught
drinking beer in a tavern...

36:13.104 --> 36:16.904
we don't ban Budweiser
across the nation.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.302
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

36:21.512 --> 36:24.379
you've heard a lot here today,
and I'm not gonna try...

36:24.582 --> 36:27.142
to go back over it all again for you.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.744
But you have to go back in that
room and make some decisions.

36:31.956 --> 36:37.087
And there is one thing I want to make
very very very clear to you before you do.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.357
I am not trying to convince you...

36:39.564 --> 36:42.692
that you should like
what Larry Flynt does.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.895
I don't like what Larry Flynt does.

36:47.905 --> 36:49.805
But what I do like...

36:50.007 --> 36:53.135
is that I live in a country...

36:53.344 --> 36:56.745
where you and I can make
that decision for ourselves.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.884
I like that I live in a country
where I can pick up Hustler...

37:01.619 --> 37:03.280
and read it if I want to...

37:03.487 --> 37:07.116
or throw it in the garbage can if
that's where I think it belongs.

37:07.692 --> 37:10.627
Or better yet, I can exercise
my opinion and not buy it.

37:10.828 --> 37:13.524
I like that I have that right.
I care about it.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.493
And you should care about it too.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.669
You really should.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.904
Because we live in a free country.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.234
We say that a lot,
but I think sometimes we forget...

37:25.443 --> 37:27.707
really what that means,
so listen to it again.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.210
We live in a free country.

37:30.414 --> 37:34.908
And that is a powerful idea.
That's a magnificent way to live.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.849
But there's a price for that freedom,
which is that sometimes...

37:38.055 --> 37:41.422
we have to tolerate things
that we don't necessarily like.

37:41.626 --> 37:44.117
So go back in that room,
where you are free to think...

37:44.328 --> 37:47.889
whatever you want to think about
Larry Flynt and Hustler magazine.

37:49.567 --> 37:53.003
But ask yourselves if you want to
make that decision for the rest of us.

37:53.504 --> 37:57.372
Because the freedom that
everyone in this room enjoys...

37:57.575 --> 38:00.339
is in a very real way in your hands.

38:00.544 --> 38:05.948
If we start throwing up walls against
what some of us think is obscene...

38:06.317 --> 38:08.308
we may very well
wake up one morning...

38:08.519 --> 38:10.419
and realize walls have
been thrown up...

38:10.621 --> 38:13.784
in all kinds of places
that we never expected.

38:14.191 --> 38:18.127
And we can't see
anything or do anything.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.861
And that's not freedom.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.263
That is not freedom.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.098
So be careful.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.369
Thank you.

38:40.618 --> 38:44.520
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, Your Honor, we have.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.122
Hand the verdict to the Bailiff.

38:58.769 --> 39:01.795
Will the defendant please rise?

39:08.612 --> 39:10.443
Madam Clerk,
read the verdict.

39:13.784 --> 39:16.082
"We, the jury,
find the defendant...

39:16.287 --> 39:20.018
Larry Claxton Flynt,
guilty as charged on all counts."

39:26.897 --> 39:29.627
Do you have anything to
say before I sentence you?

39:32.303 --> 39:33.998
Your Honor...

39:34.305 --> 39:36.466
you have not made...

39:36.841 --> 39:40.277
one intelligent decision during
the course of this trial...

39:40.611 --> 39:42.306
and I don't expect one now.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.371
Knock yourself out.

39:45.182 --> 39:48.379
I sentence you to 25 years in
the Ohio State Penitentiary.

39:49.487 --> 39:50.852
- No!
- We request bail.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.613
- Bail denied!
- Denied?!

39:53.624 --> 39:57.458
- Bailiff, take him away.
- This is a standard procedure!

39:57.661 --> 39:59.458
All I do is publish a magazine!

39:59.864 --> 40:03.322
Mrs. Flynt,
were you surprised by the verdict?

40:03.534 --> 40:06.401
No.
I was not surprised by the verdict at all.

40:06.604 --> 40:10.233
We had a stupid judge. We had an
uptight prosecutor, two of them.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.635
Are you ashamed to have
your husband locked up?

40:12.843 --> 40:15.175
I am not ashamed of Larry.
I never would be.

40:15.379 --> 40:18.109
I'd rather have a man who stands
up for what he believes in.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.579
Of course,
I'm not happy he's going to jail.

40:20.785 --> 40:23.515
But you know what?
You guys can call this a circus...

40:23.721 --> 40:25.655
you can call it a witch-hunt,
but you can't...

40:50.881 --> 40:52.872
Hi, baby.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.852
You are so beautiful.

40:59.423 --> 41:01.891
- How are you?
- I miss you.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.685
I miss you too.

41:06.363 --> 41:09.025
You got any girlfriends in here?

41:12.570 --> 41:16.666
- You got calluses on your hands?
- You know it.

41:16.874 --> 41:20.810
I fantasize about you, just,
all the time.

41:22.012 --> 41:24.810
Our bed is so empty.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.680
Oh, baby.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.651
Oh, baby.

41:35.259 --> 41:37.784
Oh, God.

41:40.064 --> 41:42.032
Oh, baby.

41:44.768 --> 41:47.828
What can I do to get you out of here?

41:49.507 --> 41:52.943
You know, Isaacman says there's
no way this is gonna hold up.

41:53.143 --> 41:55.373
What if Alan's wrong?

41:55.579 --> 41:58.605
What if you don't get
out till the year 2000...

41:58.816 --> 42:03.082
and I'm fat and old and ugly,
and you don't love me anymore?

42:03.287 --> 42:06.950
You ain't never gonna
be old and fat and ugly.

42:07.157 --> 42:09.250
I promise you.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.589
- I love you.
- I love you.

42:51.168 --> 42:52.658
Please, please, please.

42:52.870 --> 42:54.531
Please, please.

42:54.738 --> 42:58.071
And now,
Americans for a Free Press...

42:58.275 --> 43:03.303
take extreme pleasure in welcoming
to Cincinnati, direct from jail...

43:03.514 --> 43:06.244
cleared 100% by the appellate court...

43:06.450 --> 43:10.614
This is really great. Americans for a
Free Press to invite us here tonight.

43:11.121 --> 43:14.579
You idiot.
Americans for a Free Press is me.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.317
- Who do you think's paying for this?
- That freedom fighter...

43:17.528 --> 43:21.055
Larry C.
Flynt!

43:27.004 --> 43:28.631
Thank you.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.165
- Thank you.
- We love you, Larry!

43:31.375 --> 43:35.505
I have a thought for you.
Murder is illegal.

43:35.713 --> 43:39.046
When you take a picture of somebody
committing the act of murder...

43:39.249 --> 43:41.877
they'll put you on the
cover of Newsweek.

43:42.086 --> 43:44.748
You might even win a Pulitzer Prize.

43:44.955 --> 43:48.721
And yet sex is legal.

43:48.926 --> 43:53.056
Everybody's doing it,
or everybody wants to be doing it, huh?

43:53.364 --> 43:57.232
Yet you take a picture of two
people in the act of sex...

43:57.434 --> 44:00.426
or just take a picture of
a woman's naked body...

44:00.638 --> 44:03.129
and they'll put you in jail.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.807
Now, I have a message...

44:05.009 --> 44:09.537
for all you good, moral,
Christian people who are complaining...

44:09.747 --> 44:13.581
that breasts and vaginas are obscene.
Hey, don't complain to me.

44:13.784 --> 44:16.082
Complain to the manufacturer.
Okay?

44:16.286 --> 44:20.689
Although Jesus told us not to judge,
I know you will. So judge sanely.

44:20.891 --> 44:24.054
Judge with your eyes open.
What do you consider obscene?

44:24.261 --> 44:26.786
Is this obscene to you?

44:26.997 --> 44:31.093
Or perhaps that's obscene to you.

44:31.301 --> 44:33.701
Maybe this is obscene to you.

44:33.904 --> 44:37.965
But what is more obscene?
This?

44:38.409 --> 44:39.933
Or this?

44:40.144 --> 44:41.873
This?

44:42.846 --> 44:44.336
Or this?

44:44.548 --> 44:48.245
You know, politicians and
demagogues like to say...

44:48.452 --> 44:52.582
that sexually explicit material
corrupts the youth of our country...

44:52.790 --> 44:57.284
and yet they lie,
cheat and start unholy wars.

44:57.494 --> 45:01.260
Look at them. They call themselves
men. They're sheep in a herd!

45:01.465 --> 45:06.027
I think the real obscenity comes
from raising our youth to believe...

45:06.236 --> 45:09.637
that sex is bad and ugly and dirty.

45:09.840 --> 45:14.334
And yet,
it is heroic to go spill guts and blood...

45:14.545 --> 45:18.106
in the most ghastly manner
in the name of humanity.

45:18.315 --> 45:22.615
With all the taboos attached to sex,
it's no wonder we have problems.

45:22.820 --> 45:26.551
It's no wonder we're angry
and violent and genocidal.

45:26.757 --> 45:28.952
But ask yourself the question:

45:29.159 --> 45:32.458
What is more obscene, sex...

45:32.996 --> 45:35.692
- or war?
- War!

45:54.651 --> 45:57.916
She's a...
She's a killer.

46:07.865 --> 46:10.425
- Larry?
- Yeah?

46:13.704 --> 46:16.935
- Hi, Althea.
- Hi, Arlo.

46:17.207 --> 46:19.232
Arlo, you wanted something?

46:19.443 --> 46:23.345
Yes, I've got bad news.

46:26.016 --> 46:30.419
A Georgia prosecutor arrested some
news dealers for selling Hustler...

46:31.121 --> 46:34.454
and some other retailers
are getting nervous...

46:34.658 --> 46:37.126
and they're taking
issues off the stands.

46:37.427 --> 46:39.327
Fuel the jet.

46:39.530 --> 46:41.054
Okay.

46:41.265 --> 46:45.929
Wait. Alert the Georgia media.
Tell them the cavalry's on the way.

46:55.012 --> 46:56.604
Larry, why are you here?

46:56.814 --> 46:59.840
Good, hardworking news
vendors are being threatened.

47:00.050 --> 47:02.348
If that's not censorship,
I don't know what is.

47:02.553 --> 47:05.954
- So, what's your plan?
- Well, just watch me.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.120
Come on,
right on in here.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.690
- You okay, baby?
- I'm fine.

47:09.893 --> 47:13.056
Stand right over there.
All right. Don't crowd.

47:13.897 --> 47:16.422
Let the cameras through, okay?
You rolling?

47:16.633 --> 47:18.965
Now, what we're gonna do here is...

47:20.437 --> 47:22.337
I'm gonna pay this gentleman...

47:22.773 --> 47:24.900
$1000.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.135
I am renting the Puff and
Read for the next 24 hours.

47:29.346 --> 47:31.473
I am in control now.

47:31.682 --> 47:35.641
And anybody who would like to
purchase a copy of Hustler...

47:35.853 --> 47:38.651
Could I please buy a copy
of the Hustler magazine?

47:38.856 --> 47:42.257
Yes, you can, sir. Here is the
Hustler magazine that I am selling...

47:42.459 --> 47:44.689
That's it. Mr. Flynt,
you are under arrest.

47:44.895 --> 47:47.693
Okay.
I gotta give him some change.

47:47.898 --> 47:49.866
Only in America, huh?

47:52.202 --> 47:55.171
- How far are you willing to go?
- What are your plans now?

47:55.372 --> 47:58.808
There's many who support Hustler,
but none are willing to support you.

47:59.009 --> 48:00.408
How do you feel about that?

48:00.611 --> 48:03.944
Why do I have to go to jail
to protect your freedom?

48:09.853 --> 48:11.616
That's good.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.619
So we're gonna pay a million bucks?

48:14.958 --> 48:18.553
Why not? Listen, if it catches the killer,
I think it's worth it.

48:18.762 --> 48:22.061
Okay, moving on.
Asshole of the month.

48:22.266 --> 48:25.235
- Jerry Falwell.
- You always say Jerry Falwell.

48:25.435 --> 48:28.233
Jerry Falwell is always an asshole.
That's why, Arlo.

48:28.438 --> 48:30.804
How about this month
we do Anita Bryant?

48:31.008 --> 48:33.067
I say Gerald Ford.

48:33.277 --> 48:34.904
I say Larry Flynt.

48:39.516 --> 48:43.816
Yeah, I like that, bro. I mean,
everybody thinks I'm an asshole.

48:44.021 --> 48:46.512
- Yeah, it's true.
- Is that right?

48:48.625 --> 48:51.560
- Larry, you have a phone call.
- Take a message.

48:51.762 --> 48:55.129
- How about asshole of the decade?
- She's calling from North Carolina.

48:55.332 --> 48:58.665
She says she's the president's sister.
Ruth Carter something.

48:59.169 --> 49:01.000
Ruth Carter Stapleton?

49:01.471 --> 49:05.100
- She's a woman of God.
- What does she want with you?

49:07.611 --> 49:10.580
What are you afraid of?
Pick up the phone.

49:11.448 --> 49:12.972
Okay.

49:13.183 --> 49:15.913
Patch her through.
Hello, this is Larry Flynt.

49:16.119 --> 49:19.282
- Praise the Lord, I've found you.
- Hallelujah.

49:19.489 --> 49:21.548
What can I help you with?

49:21.758 --> 49:24.727
We have a mutual friend, Larry,
a television producer...

49:24.928 --> 49:27.055
and he suggested we get together.

49:27.264 --> 49:29.926
He thought you and I would hit it off.

49:30.567 --> 49:33.695
You know, I don't understand.
I mean, you're an evangelist...

49:33.904 --> 49:36.031
and I'm a smut peddler...

49:36.239 --> 49:38.707
Larry, I don't believe in labels.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.776
I think you and I could
teach each other a lot.

49:41.979 --> 49:45.107
So are you free for
dinner tomorrow night?

49:46.416 --> 49:49.078
You know,
I have a hectic schedule.

49:49.286 --> 49:52.778
You know what's nice about
people like you and me, Mr. Flynt?

49:52.990 --> 49:56.448
- What's that?
- We can do anything we want.

50:12.709 --> 50:14.643
Do you go to church, Larry?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.369
Yeah, church.

50:16.580 --> 50:20.949
Particularly, you know,
the big holidays...

50:21.151 --> 50:24.848
Christmas and Easter
and New Year's Eve.

50:25.489 --> 50:27.480
New Year's Eve?

50:28.191 --> 50:29.988
Well, that...

50:30.193 --> 50:33.094
They don't have church on
New Year's Eve. Okay, well...

50:33.296 --> 50:36.129
we've proven I'm a liar and...

50:36.533 --> 50:39.696
- I never go.
- It's not important.

50:39.903 --> 50:41.837
That's only a ritual.

50:42.372 --> 50:45.034
And I believe in going straight
to the teachings of Jesus.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.540
And does she love that man.

50:48.545 --> 50:51.480
So would you call yourself...

50:52.015 --> 50:54.006
a faith healer?

50:54.217 --> 50:57.414
Goodness, no.
I do spiritual healing.

50:58.555 --> 51:02.616
I don't mend bones.
I mend troubled souls.

51:04.227 --> 51:08.891
That's a relief. I thought you might
be like those tent revival fakes

51:09.099 --> 51:13.297
you know, that used to come
scare the kids with snakes

51:13.503 --> 51:15.471
and, you know, "Wicked this,
wicked that,"and

51:15.672 --> 51:18.197
Hellfire?
Damnation?

51:18.408 --> 51:20.467
- That sort of thing?
- Yeah.

51:21.178 --> 51:25.672
That kind of talk is almost unforgivable.

51:28.051 --> 51:30.212
Well, then,
I'd say we have

51:30.420 --> 51:32.081
something in common.

51:32.389 --> 51:36.519
Actually, Larry, there's something
else you and I have in common.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.427
What's that?

51:38.628 --> 51:41.529
We're both trying to
release people from

51:41.731 --> 51:44.325
sexual repression.

51:45.068 --> 51:46.626
Really?

51:47.070 --> 51:49.095
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stapleton.

51:53.710 --> 51:59.148
So tell me, is your brother,
Ji... Mr. President

51:59.349 --> 52:03.046
- Jimmy. Jimmy will be fine.
- Okay. Jimmy...

52:05.822 --> 52:09.724
You think he ever read my publication?

52:09.926 --> 52:13.157
You remember that interview
he gave Playboy magazine?

52:13.363 --> 52:16.264
The one where he admitted
that he had lust in his heart?

52:16.466 --> 52:18.559
You know,
I was especially proud of that.

52:18.768 --> 52:23.796
I'm sure you were. But Oral Roberts
wasn't, and Billy Graham wasn't.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.100
And they took out after him in public.

52:26.309 --> 52:29.608
So I don't think he's a big
fan of adult magazines.

52:31.848 --> 52:36.911
But you know, Larry, I'm more
ambivalent about what you do.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.114
Because I think that
sexuality is a God-given gift.

52:42.726 --> 52:44.284
I have to agree with you.

52:44.494 --> 52:49.090
When I counsel Pentecostal women in bad
marriages, I don't take the Bible out.

52:49.299 --> 52:53.531
I say to them, "Get some makeup.
Get yourself some curlers.

52:53.737 --> 52:56.001
Make yourself beautiful.

52:56.206 --> 52:59.767
- Jesus wants you to be beautiful."
- Yeah, well, that...

52:59.976 --> 53:03.275
You're something.
You surprise me.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.916
Larry, what was your childhood like?

53:09.519 --> 53:11.919
You know, sometimes

53:12.122 --> 53:15.990
things happen to us
when we're very young

53:16.193 --> 53:18.718
that can hurt for many years after.

53:18.929 --> 53:23.059
You know,
I think we're all born into this world...

53:32.876 --> 53:34.503
Why?
Why?

53:34.711 --> 53:38.010
- Because I had an epiphany, okay?
- A what?

53:38.215 --> 53:41.184
- An epiphany.
- Where'd you learn that damn word?

53:41.384 --> 53:44.353
She's crooking you so hard,
she's teaching you English now?

53:44.554 --> 53:45.885
She ain't crooking me.

53:46.089 --> 53:50.856
- It was more an acid flashback.
- Don't belittle it like that!

53:51.061 --> 53:52.528
It was a serious thing!

53:52.729 --> 53:56.495
Do you think that I wanted Jesus
to tap me on the shoulder?

53:56.700 --> 53:59.362
I'm the last guy who wanted that.
I'm getting laid six times a day.

53:59.569 --> 54:02.732
I got limos and a jet,
and I'm sitting on a mountain of money.

54:02.939 --> 54:06.841
I didn't want God tapping me on
the shoulder. I didn't want that.

54:07.043 --> 54:12.071
- I had an epiphany once, Larry.
- What was that?

54:12.282 --> 54:16.616
When my daddy shot my
entire family in the head...

54:16.820 --> 54:19.846
and I was the only one
to identify the bodies.

54:20.056 --> 54:25.517
I got sent to an orphanage full of good,
Christian nuns, who shoved my face

54:25.729 --> 54:31.725
into their pussies with their crucifixes
on for eight goddamn years!

54:31.935 --> 54:38.135
- I'm sorry for you, but that does not...
- Don't be! Be sorry for yourself.

54:38.341 --> 54:42.869
- Don't start this. - We're gonna
be broke. You'll need that!

54:45.582 --> 54:48.517
Come on.
It's okay.

54:48.718 --> 54:51.710
Just get behind me on this, okay?

54:51.921 --> 54:53.821
That's all I'm asking.

54:54.024 --> 54:57.892
I feel like it's me against the world.
You're all I got, baby.

55:00.463 --> 55:02.954
Say you ain't gonna do this.
Promise me you ain't gonna do it.

55:03.166 --> 55:08.126
- I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
- No, Larry, you ain't gonna do it!

55:08.338 --> 55:12.570
Now I'm baptized too, is that it?
Fuck you, Larry! Fuck you!

55:19.049 --> 55:21.176
Hi.
How you doing?

55:30.160 --> 55:33.527
Do you accept the Lord
Jesus Christ as your savior

55:33.730 --> 55:37.029
and reject Satan and all his works?

55:37.233 --> 55:38.598
I do.

55:42.072 --> 55:46.771
In obedience to the will of God and
upon the confession of this our brother,

55:46.976 --> 55:51.675
we baptize you in the name of the
Father and in the name of the Son

55:51.881 --> 55:54.941
and in the name of the Holy Spirit.

56:02.058 --> 56:03.355
Hallelujah!

56:08.064 --> 56:11.431
There will be no more

56:11.634 --> 56:14.660
photo spreads of women alone.

56:14.871 --> 56:19.865
From now on, sex will be presented
in a more natural setting

56:20.076 --> 56:24.979
with the man in the picture,
you know, a Genesis pictorial

56:25.181 --> 56:28.844
with Adam and Eve getting
it on in the Garden of Eden.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.078
Then next month,
I'd like to have

56:32.288 --> 56:35.883
pretty girls all floating on big,
glass crucifixes.

56:36.092 --> 56:38.617
Yeah.
Marjoe Gortner could shoot that.

56:38.828 --> 56:42.821
Larry, I plead with you not to do this.

56:43.900 --> 56:47.097
If you do this,
this company's gonna be worth nothing.

56:47.303 --> 56:50.670
You're all looking at me like I'm
growing horns out of my head.

56:50.874 --> 56:54.674
Look around you.
We are living in Roman times.

56:54.878 --> 57:00.976
It is... it is time to feed
the lions to the Christians.

57:01.184 --> 57:02.378
This is a joke.

57:02.585 --> 57:08.023
You're just doing this
to help our circulation.

57:08.224 --> 57:10.021
Arlo...

57:19.869 --> 57:21.496
I love you, brother.

57:21.704 --> 57:27.540
But please don't ever, ever,
ever doubt my sincerity.

58:08.251 --> 58:10.776
This is making people sick.

58:10.987 --> 58:15.253
They're going up to the newsstands,
and they're puking. They're vomiting.

58:15.458 --> 58:19.417
Baby, I'm just trying to illustrate
that I am no longer willing

58:19.629 --> 58:23.258
to exploit the female body.

58:24.701 --> 58:27.261
You failed miserably at that.

58:27.470 --> 58:31.634
Nobody on this planet wants their
religion and their porn mixed together.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.900
Well, you know,
Ruth says that sex...

58:34.110 --> 58:37.773
Get your friend Ruth to buy 2
fucking million of these magazines

58:37.981 --> 58:40.575
because nobody else
is gonna fucking do it.

58:43.920 --> 58:49.415
Larry, I'm not gonna pretend that
I understand what you go through

58:49.626 --> 58:53.153
what this spiritual thing is to you.
I never have.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.389
But I've always been
supportive, always.

58:56.599 --> 59:00.797
And, honey,
you're just taking this too far now.

59:01.004 --> 59:03.905
It's going too far.
It's like you're losing your mind.

59:04.107 --> 59:05.540
Hey!

59:06.643 --> 59:09.009
My mind is fine.

59:09.212 --> 59:14.240
God is working through me. Don't you
see that? I could accomplish anything.

59:14.450 --> 59:16.782
I could move mountains
with God's help.

59:16.986 --> 59:22.288
You see that wall? I could make it come
tumbling down with sheer willpower.

59:22.492 --> 59:26.189
God, do it.
Just do it, then. Do it.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.591
- Do it?
- Yeah.

59:38.074 --> 59:40.099
He's gonna be thrilled about this, really.

59:40.310 --> 59:42.744
Hey, Larry.
Yeah, it's Alan.

59:42.946 --> 59:47.610
I'm here with the eminently reasonable
district attorney of the state of Georgia.

59:47.817 --> 59:52.151
He's very impressed by your conversion
and wants to cut us a plea bargain.

59:52.355 --> 59:55.483
A plea bargain because I found God.

59:55.692 --> 01:00:00.561
Larry, listen to me for a second.
Don't argue with me on this, okay?

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:04.893
Just say yes because I pulled a lot of
strings to make this happen, okay?

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:08.127
- Is he sitting right there with you?
- Yeah.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.431
Could you do me a favor?

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.542
Just tell that miserable, old,
gray-haired bastard to go fuck himself.

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.507
We're going to trial.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.511
- Okay, right.
- And praise the Lord.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.909
Right.
I got it. Okay.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.323
The Gwinnett County
Court is now in session.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:34.519
Mr. Flynt, how can you,
as a good Christian, defend this filth?

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.190
I don't have to.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.698
It may be wrong in
some people's opinion

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:44.236
to portray women the way I have,
but it's not illegal.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.343
It may not be the smartest thing to
drink too much, but it's not illegal.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:54.847
You know, abortion may be morally
repugnant, but right now it's not illegal.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:57.713
If we want to change the laws,
that's another discussion.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:04.189
But our right to decide for
ourselves cannot be restricted.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:09.721
You know, George Orwell said
that if liberty means anything,

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:14.028
it means the right to tell people
what they don't wanna hear.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:19.072
Now, America is the strongest
country in the world today

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:22.369
only because it is the freest country.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:27.140
And if it ever loses sight
of its basic heritage

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:33.050
and the principles involved,
then we will no longer be free.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.280
Larry, over here!

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.789
That was just a bang-up job you did.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.625
Did you pray before you
went into the courtroom?

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.525
No comment.
No comment.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.859
Is your wife jealous of Ruth?

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:52.167
- Is that true, Larry? - Mr. Flynt,
do you have anything to say?

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:08.057
This is Jackson. We got shots
fired in front of the courthouse.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.624
- Somebody help!
- We need an ambulance right away.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.935
Stand back! Stand back!
Ma'am, stand back!

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:43.621
A 36-year-old male,
gunshot wound to the left shoulder.

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.851
Patient doesn't appear to
have any moving sensation.

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:49.357
I want him alive!
I don't care if his head's in a fishbowl.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:52.625
Mrs. Flynt,
now you listen to me.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:56.271
There's something you have to
know before you go in that room.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.016
Hey.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:23.929
Larry, they say that you're paralyzed.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:29.034
They say you're paralyzed
from the waist down.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:36.405
They say that you
ain't gonna walk again.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.239
From the waist down?

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.586
I fucking love you.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:57.095
I'm so sorry, Althea.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.766
My dearest,
how are you?

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:09.934
The pain.
It's...

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:14.642
I feel like I'm in hell.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:19.914
No. No, you're not in hell.
You belong to God.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:25.488
I wish he'd have killed me.
I do.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.425
I can't ever walk again.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:33.591
I can't make love to my wife.
I can't...

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:39.533
I can't have a child with her.

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:42.506
But don't give in to the bitterness.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:46.842
You'll be so much stronger
if you keep your faith.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.244
God will see you through this.

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.885
Ruth...

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:55.450
there is no God.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:05:01.256
Take this thing down. I want all
this Christian stuff out of here now.

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:06.401
Ladies, gentlemen...

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:10.898
The reign of Christian terror
at this magazine is now over.

01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:14.888
We're smut peddlers again.
We're going back to our roots.

01:05:15.097 --> 01:05:19.033
- We are "porn" again.
- When's Larry coming back?

01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:22.469
Larry's coming back soon.

01:05:22.671 --> 01:05:26.539
So, what do we know?

01:05:27.075 --> 01:05:29.873
The FBI ain't got nothing.
That's what we know.

01:05:30.078 --> 01:05:32.274
Well, who the hell would want
to shoot you anyway, Larry?

01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:34.274
Who wouldn't want
to shoot me, Jimmy?

01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:37.477
- I'd say it was the CIA.
- Why?

01:05:37.686 --> 01:05:41.178
Because of the million dollars
that was offered for J.F.K.'s killers.

01:05:41.957 --> 01:05:45.859
No. I think it was the interracial
photo spreads. The KKK.

01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:48.325
The KKK? It wasn't the KKK.
It was the Mob.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:51.624
The extreme religious right there the
ones that controls all of the fanatics.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.230
Oh, you've just named
every American psycho.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.530
Let's try to narrow the
field here a little bit.

01:05:56.838 --> 01:05:58.669
- Larry...
- Yeah?

01:05:58.874 --> 01:06:03.038
You're always, always gonna
have to watch your ass. Forever.

01:06:04.046 --> 01:06:09.507
I ought to move somewhere
where perverts are welcome.

01:06:58.567 --> 01:07:01.001
Where you going, baby?

01:07:01.203 --> 01:07:04.070
I'm gonna get some ice cream.
You want some?

01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:07.264
- I want some more.
- Larry, I just gave you twice your dose.

01:07:07.476 --> 01:07:12.072
- Please, please, please.
- Larry, you're gonna overdose.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.215
I'm not gonna overdose.
I'm in pain.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.885
- Larry, you're just doing this to get off.
- More!

01:07:25.594 --> 01:07:28.927
I'm only giving you half
of what I just gave you.

01:07:29.131 --> 01:07:31.565
Don't ask for any more for a while.

01:07:58.193 --> 01:07:59.490
Tight.

01:08:05.867 --> 01:08:07.300
Okay.

01:08:13.141 --> 01:08:15.075
Okay, let go.
Let go.

01:08:18.113 --> 01:08:19.102
You all right?

01:08:19.314 --> 01:08:22.078
I love you, baby.

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:29.015
Oh, God.

01:09:37.192 --> 01:09:39.126
Oh, God.

01:10:13.895 --> 01:10:16.455
- Hi, Dr. Bob.
- Hello, Althea.

01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:19.190
- How's Larry today?
- Shitty.

01:10:20.902 --> 01:10:22.927
Pretty shitty.

01:10:23.905 --> 01:10:28.399
- How are you today, Larry?
- Terrible. I'm in pain.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.805
He can hardly talk.

01:10:31.012 --> 01:10:33.344
You know, Larry,
we're running out of options here.

01:10:33.548 --> 01:10:36.415
The drugs, your pain,
it's gonna kill you.

01:10:36.618 --> 01:10:38.381
Something stronger.

01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:43.948
This is 30 grand.

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:48.960
Can we just have our medicine, please,
Dr. Bob? In peace?

01:10:49.164 --> 01:10:50.722
Larry, there is an operation.

01:10:50.932 --> 01:10:54.231
Apparently it's been very
successful for this kind of pain.

01:10:56.438 --> 01:10:59.896
- Ready for the laser.
- Laser ready. Five watts.

01:11:00.442 --> 01:11:02.342
Okay, let's go.

01:11:33.274 --> 01:11:35.174
Hey, baby.

01:11:35.377 --> 01:11:37.311
- Hi, cutie.
- What's that?

01:11:37.512 --> 01:11:42.950
Some lady died down the hall,
and I got her flowers.

01:11:46.855 --> 01:11:50.814
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:56.160
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel... I feel great.

01:11:56.364 --> 01:11:59.629
You know, I don't,
for the first time since those bullets...

01:11:59.834 --> 01:12:02.234
I don't feel any pain.

01:12:03.338 --> 01:12:08.799
- No, I don't want it, baby.
- What do you mean? What do you...?

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.204
I feel good.

01:12:10.412 --> 01:12:12.880
And you're not on nothing?

01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:16.573
You're crooking me,
or you're a fucking liar.

01:12:17.552 --> 01:12:20.180
You've been on drugs for
four or five years, Larry.

01:12:20.388 --> 01:12:25.519
I have a hard time believing that you
feel really great on nothing right now.

01:12:25.727 --> 01:12:29.629
Is it that hard to believe
that I don't want any?

01:12:29.831 --> 01:12:31.423
Yes, it's that hard to believe.

01:12:31.633 --> 01:12:34.193
Baby, I was taking the
drugs because I was in pain.

01:12:34.402 --> 01:12:38.304
I'm not in pain now, so I don't want it.
Why would I want it?

01:12:38.506 --> 01:12:41.873
- I don't know.
- I don't know why you want it.

01:12:43.178 --> 01:12:46.944
Well, if I don't take it,
I'll go into seizures

01:12:47.148 --> 01:12:50.083
and get really sick.
And it makes me feel good. Here.

01:12:50.285 --> 01:12:52.753
- I don't want it!
- In two hours, you'll want it again!

01:12:52.954 --> 01:12:55.081
I'm done with it!
I'm done with it, okay?

01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:57.622
- You've said this before.
I've heard about it. - Stop it!

01:12:57.826 --> 01:13:01.592
That's because you're fucking on...
Here take all...

01:13:01.796 --> 01:13:03.923
Come on, Larry.
Stop. Stop it.

01:13:04.132 --> 01:13:06.362
- Get the hell out of way! I said don't
want it! - Stop. You're gonna hurt...

01:13:06.568 --> 01:13:10.629
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Stop it, please. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:14.433
I don't know.

01:13:17.178 --> 01:13:21.137
We've been through a lot together.
We can make it through this.

01:13:23.751 --> 01:13:25.654
You're gonna go cold turkey?

01:13:25.655 --> 01:13:28.984
I am going cold turkey,
and so are you. Okay?

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.124
- No.
- Yes.

01:13:31.993 --> 01:13:33.984
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:39.763
No, I can't, Larry.

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:43.562
What am I gonna do?

01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:48.299
What the hell do I need that shit for?
I want my mind back.

01:14:03.424 --> 01:14:05.585
Yes, Ms. Bacardi, hi.

01:14:14.903 --> 01:14:17.133
The pervert is back!

01:14:21.876 --> 01:14:23.275
What's your name?

01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:24.502
Sophie.

01:14:24.712 --> 01:14:28.045
Tell everybody the pervert is back.

01:14:30.084 --> 01:14:33.542
The pervert is back.
The pervert is back.

01:14:33.755 --> 01:14:38.283
- The pervert is back.
- Circulation is down by a third.

01:14:38.493 --> 01:14:42.327
Color reproduction is horrible.

01:14:43.097 --> 01:14:46.931
The models look like
they're 3-dollar whores.

01:14:47.135 --> 01:14:51.162
The writing is by some moronic idiots.

01:14:51.372 --> 01:14:56.036
Mr. Flynt,
I don't want to step on your toes...

01:14:56.244 --> 01:15:00.180
but things have changed since you
were actively running the company.

01:15:00.381 --> 01:15:04.545
I mean, I look back at the stuff
you did in the '70s, and it was

01:15:04.752 --> 01:15:09.587
sort of racy and crazy.
But the country's different now.

01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:14.819
Reagan has rebuilt America,
and the Moral Majority is gaining power.

01:15:15.029 --> 01:15:17.088
You're fired.

01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:18.595
Excuse me?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.961
You, get the fuck out of my building!

01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:23.034
Doug, get him out of here!

01:15:23.237 --> 01:15:26.141
Get that blow-dried jerk motherfucker,

01:15:26.237 --> 01:15:28.141
get him out of here and
throw him in the incinerator!

01:15:28.843 --> 01:15:32.609
Cut him into little pieces and feed
him to the animals! Get out of here!

01:15:32.814 --> 01:15:37.547
Larry, Larry, you can't do that!
I mean, he's our vice president!

01:15:37.752 --> 01:15:39.811
He's the VP of marketing!

01:15:40.021 --> 01:15:43.013
Hey, Jimbo, are you trying
to challenge my authority?

01:15:43.224 --> 01:15:46.352
You see that on the wall?
"LFP".

01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:51.055
That's Larry Flynt Publications.
Not JFP!

01:15:51.265 --> 01:15:54.962
Okay, I'm the big kahuna here!
Do you have a problem with that?

01:15:55.737 --> 01:15:59.605
No, Larry.
You're the boss.

01:16:03.811 --> 01:16:07.804
So, Larry,
what's the plan?

01:16:09.684 --> 01:16:13.620
Plan.
The plan is simple.

01:16:13.821 --> 01:16:17.917
The establishment took
my manhood from me

01:16:18.893 --> 01:16:21.794
but they left half of me.
They left the half with the brain.

01:16:21.996 --> 01:16:25.488
And I'm gonna use it to get back.

01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:32.532
- Hello?
- Wake up.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.866
Who is this?

01:16:34.075 --> 01:16:39.274
It's Larry Flynt. Is CBS interested
in seeing videotape of the FBI...

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.110
selling John DeLorean
50 kilos of cocaine?

01:16:44.318 --> 01:16:46.843
- Are you Mr. Waverly?
- Yeah, yeah. Who are you?

01:16:47.055 --> 01:16:48.989
I'm Mrs. Flynt.

01:16:56.064 --> 01:16:59.056
Do you want some coffee
or tea or sandwiches

01:16:59.267 --> 01:17:01.667
or Ho Hos or Pringles or something?

01:17:01.869 --> 01:17:04.861
No, that's all right.
Can I just see the tape, please?

01:17:08.543 --> 01:17:11.068
- John Delorean.
- It's Delorean.

01:17:11.279 --> 01:17:15.272
These are the drug dealers.
And guess what this is.

01:17:15.483 --> 01:17:17.713
That's the coke? That's the suitcase,
the whole suitcase?

01:17:17.919 --> 01:17:23.983
Yeah, watch this. Delorean, he...
The first time to touch it. That's it.

01:17:24.192 --> 01:17:27.320
That's all the contact he
had with that cocaine.

01:17:27.528 --> 01:17:31.555
This is my favorite part.
They can't get this damn...

01:17:31.766 --> 01:17:34.894
They can't get the
suitcase closed, right?

01:17:35.103 --> 01:17:37.435
There's a lot of cocaine
in this motherfucker.

01:17:37.638 --> 01:17:41.039
How do you get the damn thing closed?
They're all pushing down on it.

01:17:41.242 --> 01:17:44.006
- This is amazing.
- Now they do a toast.

01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:48.040
Now watch this.
This is weird.

01:17:48.249 --> 01:17:50.547
There's a knock at the door.

01:17:50.752 --> 01:17:53.915
Tubby gets up and goes to the door.
Look.

01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:57.649
Four million dollars' worth of cocaine,
nobody's even nervous.

01:17:57.859 --> 01:17:59.690
Now watch.

01:18:02.597 --> 01:18:05.532
FBI.
FBI, right?

01:18:05.733 --> 01:18:09.169
This guy's got a good camera sense.
Watch him clear camera. Watch him...

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:11.930
"Let me get out of your way.
"Now watch this guy.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.507
Grabs his champagne,
and he walks away.

01:18:16.344 --> 01:18:21.748
These guys aren't concerned about him,
because they're FBI.

01:18:21.949 --> 01:18:25.385
Your Honor, the tapes are genuine,
and we have a right to broadcast them.

01:18:25.586 --> 01:18:28.716
That's ridiculous,
this is stolen government evidence.

01:18:29.924 --> 01:18:32.688
My client, Mr. Delorean,
will never find an impartial jury.

01:18:32.894 --> 01:18:35.362
Say, we're talking about
basic constitutional rights...

01:18:35.363 --> 01:18:36.728
Judge, you do not condone...

01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:40.726
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

01:18:41.269 --> 01:18:42.600
Stolen tapes.

01:18:43.304 --> 01:18:47.365
- Gentlemen, that's enough.
- It's stolen, judge. It's stolen.

01:18:49.677 --> 01:18:53.374
Here is the Campari
ad-campaign parody.

01:18:53.581 --> 01:18:57.142
"Jerry Falwell talks about his first time."

01:19:00.288 --> 01:19:01.915
You guys are stupid.

01:19:02.123 --> 01:19:04.318
Do you ever have anything
positive to say, Jimmy?

01:19:04.525 --> 01:19:06.959
- Larry.
- Yeah?

01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:10.062
Listen, I got a subpoena here for you
to appear in federal court tomorrow

01:19:10.264 --> 01:19:12.391
to reveal the source
of the Delorean tape.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.435
The FBI got very pissed off, Larry.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.235
You know, they want you in
front of the judge tomorrow,

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:16.935
reveal the source.

01:19:17.638 --> 01:19:21.574
Well, you tell that judge I'm
wiping my ass with his subpoena.

01:19:21.776 --> 01:19:23.334
Why is your client doing this?

01:19:23.544 --> 01:19:25.978
Your Honor,
my client is a very complicated man.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.512
He's heavily medicated,
among other things.

01:19:28.716 --> 01:19:31.241
I believe him to be an
undiagnosed manic-depressive.

01:19:31.452 --> 01:19:35.081
Well, I'll give him something to
be depressed about, all right.

01:19:35.289 --> 01:19:37.689
I'm issuing a bench
warrant for his arrest.

01:19:45.566 --> 01:19:47.158
A warrant for the arrest of Mr. Flynt...

01:19:57.345 --> 01:20:02.009
"If anyone tries coming after me,
I'll shoot him between the eyes."

01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:06.050
Flynt has been barricaded in his Beverly
Hills compound for three days now.

01:20:17.598 --> 01:20:19.327
Holy shit!

01:20:19.533 --> 01:20:21.899
Freeze!
Federal marshals!

01:20:22.103 --> 01:20:23.968
You, drop the gun.
Now!

01:20:24.171 --> 01:20:28.665
Hands in front! Hands!
You, hands on your head. Now!

01:20:28.876 --> 01:20:30.366
On your knees!

01:20:35.216 --> 01:20:40.813
NBC, ABC.
What the hell's wrong with you, CBS?

01:20:41.022 --> 01:20:43.249
Larry Flynt, we're federal marshals!
You come out of there!

01:20:43.322 --> 01:20:45.049
Shut up!

01:20:45.993 --> 01:20:48.461
Where are your fucking priorities?

01:20:48.663 --> 01:20:52.258
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

01:20:52.466 --> 01:20:56.732
I turned the whole world into a tabloid!

01:20:58.606 --> 01:20:59.766
Here I come.

01:21:07.982 --> 01:21:12.749
- Larry, are you going somewhere?
- Yeah!

01:21:12.954 --> 01:21:15.616
- Larry...
- Roll on out of there, Flynt, now!

01:21:15.823 --> 01:21:21.386
- Will you get me some bananas?
- Yes, I'll get you bananas.

01:21:22.096 --> 01:21:23.961
Thank you, honey.

01:21:29.503 --> 01:21:33.098
Please raise your right hand and
place your left hand on the Bible.

01:21:33.307 --> 01:21:34.433
Larry.

01:21:37.778 --> 01:21:40.542
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth

01:21:40.748 --> 01:21:43.410
so help you God?
- No.

01:21:44.118 --> 01:21:45.915
No?!

01:21:47.555 --> 01:21:50.718
Your Honor, I'm an atheist.
I can't very well

01:21:50.925 --> 01:21:54.520
swear to a God I don't believe exists.

01:21:55.529 --> 01:22:00.023
- Mr. Flynt, you are a handful.
- I know, Your Honor.

01:22:00.267 --> 01:22:04.203
We'll allow you to affirm if
that's satisfactory with you, sir.

01:22:04.405 --> 01:22:06.896
That would satisfy me.

01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:10.008
Well, sir, I just need for you
to answer one question,

01:22:10.109 --> 01:22:13.008
and then you're able to go back home.

01:22:13.214 --> 01:22:14.408
Shoot.

01:22:14.615 --> 01:22:17.083
What was the source of this videotape?

01:22:17.284 --> 01:22:20.811
Your Honor, Vicki Morgan was
Alfred Bloomingdale's mistress.

01:22:21.022 --> 01:22:24.321
- Excuse me, Your Honor. Excuse...
- It's okay, Alan.

01:22:24.525 --> 01:22:28.621
And Alfred introduced her to
all Reagan's Cabinet buddies.

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:32.925
And she was a real party girl.
And they really liked her.

01:22:33.167 --> 01:22:35.135
If you know what I mean,
Your Honor.

01:22:37.338 --> 01:22:41.741
So the thing about Vicki is,
she was a bit naive

01:22:41.942 --> 01:22:47.539
and she started writing a book about
all these orgies that they were having.

01:22:47.748 --> 01:22:50.808
And next thing you know, bam,
she's murdered.

01:22:51.018 --> 01:22:54.283
But what these White
House killers don't realize

01:22:54.488 --> 01:22:59.482
is that Vicki kept some
videotapes of their sexcapades.

01:22:59.693 --> 01:23:05.461
And these tapes, Your Honor,
are pure carnality.

01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:09.500
Filthy.
I've never seen anything...

01:23:09.703 --> 01:23:14.231
Well, I have, but most people haven't
seen anything like this. Your Honor...

01:23:14.442 --> 01:23:18.674
What has this got to do
with the DeLorean trial?

01:23:20.881 --> 01:23:22.974
That's a good question.

01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:26.643
Well, technically, nothing,
Your Honor.

01:23:26.854 --> 01:23:31.848
But, you know, I have those tapes and
this tape, and it just made me think of it.

01:23:32.059 --> 01:23:35.893
Mr. Flynt, I'd appreciate it, sir,
if you would stick to the subject.

01:23:36.097 --> 01:23:40.193
Now, I'll ask you again,
what was the source of this videotape?

01:23:40.401 --> 01:23:43.928
Your Honor, with all due respect,
you don't have the right to ask!

01:23:44.138 --> 01:23:46.265
That's it.
You're in contempt of court.

01:23:46.474 --> 01:23:49.705
And as of tomorrow,
I'm fining you $10,000 a day

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:52.879
until you reveal the
source of your videotape!

01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:02.048
Look, there's Larry.
Look.

01:24:04.391 --> 01:24:06.882
All right, folks, make way.
Let us through.

01:24:07.128 --> 01:24:09.460
Mr. Flynt,
is this a conspiracy?

01:24:19.206 --> 01:24:22.175
Larry, where did you get the tapes?

01:24:22.743 --> 01:24:27.407
What have you done with the Vicki
Morgan tapes. Do we get to see...

01:24:28.816 --> 01:24:31.808
Do you really have the
Vicki Morgan sex tapes?

01:24:32.086 --> 01:24:37.285
No. I told them I had the DeLorean
tapes. Now they believe anything I say.

01:24:37.591 --> 01:24:39.149
Sir, you gonna have to
take that helmet off.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.955
We don't wear hats in the Federal
courtroom. There's no war going on here.

01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:46.297
You can never be too careful,
Your Honor.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.264
Don't worry, Mr. Flynt,
the government will take care of you.

01:24:49.503 --> 01:24:55.066
We brought some extra marshals today. So
I'd appreciate your taking off that helmet.

01:24:55.309 --> 01:25:00.144
Are you going to obey the court and
reveal the source of that videotape

01:25:00.347 --> 01:25:03.475
or are you gonna pay the
$10,000 that I ordered?

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.616
- Your Honor, I'd like a moment with my
client. - I don't need it. It is my right...

01:25:10.925 --> 01:25:15.021
under the freedom of the First
Amendment, to protect my sources!

01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:17.789
Listen, don't go any further.

01:25:18.065 --> 01:25:20.659
Shut up!
Relax, Alan, relax!

01:25:20.901 --> 01:25:23.870
Mr. Flynt,
is that an American flag you have on?

01:25:24.071 --> 01:25:27.802
I have fashioned this
American flag into a diaper.

01:25:28.008 --> 01:25:31.466
Because if you're gonna treat me
like a baby, I'm gonna act like one.

01:25:31.779 --> 01:25:35.529
Larry Flynt, I'm ordering you arrested
for desecration of the flag.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.183
Marshal, take him into custody.

01:25:37.451 --> 01:25:40.852
- Your Honor, we'd like to post bond.
- Get the hell away from me!

01:25:41.055 --> 01:25:44.286
- Take it easy.
- Just a minute, marshal.

01:25:44.525 --> 01:25:49.485
Very well. The court will set a bond
on Mr. Larry Flynt for $50,000.

01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:54.531
- This time I'd prefer a cashier's check.
- Understood. Understood.

01:25:55.202 --> 01:25:56.464
Furthermore...

01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:59.605
I'm gonna keep Mr. Flynt
under a tight leash.

01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:05.776
So as a condition of his bond,
he cannot leave the state of California.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.507
Larry!
Hey, Larry! Hey!

01:26:09.717 --> 01:26:12.345
- Larry, you're not getting
on that plane. - Yes, I am.

01:26:12.553 --> 01:26:13.713
No, you're not!
Don't do it.

01:26:13.921 --> 01:26:16.464
You think this is some
kind of a game or play?

01:26:16.465 --> 01:26:19.223
You're right. You're
right. It's a fucking joke!

01:26:19.426 --> 01:26:23.055
Five and a half years since they
shot me, and the government...

01:26:23.264 --> 01:26:28.395
I was there too, all right? Remember?
You don't see me running around...

01:26:28.602 --> 01:26:32.231
- pissing off everyone who can help us.
- Well, you can walk...

01:26:32.439 --> 01:26:35.340
and you can fuck,
and I'm in this chair!

01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:40.879
And I got money.
And that gives me the power

01:26:41.148 --> 01:26:43.582
to shake up this system.
Dougie

01:26:45.185 --> 01:26:48.951
Find somebody else to help you, then.
This is not what I signed on for.

01:26:49.156 --> 01:26:53.024
I don't even know what we're
engaged in anymore, Larry.

01:26:53.294 --> 01:26:57.162
- If you get on that plane, I quit.
- Alan, don't be so melodramatic.

01:26:57.464 --> 01:27:00.490
You don't want to quit me.
I'm your dream client.

01:27:00.701 --> 01:27:06.071
I'm the most fun,
I'm rich and I'm always in trouble.

01:27:06.273 --> 01:27:09.868
Hey, go to hell, Larry.
Go to hell.

01:27:10.377 --> 01:27:11.435
Bye.

01:27:17.918 --> 01:27:19.710
Why did you disobey
this court's order?

01:27:19.711 --> 01:27:22.981
Didn't I make it clear to you that you
were not allow to leave California?

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:26.853
- We had an honest misunderstanding.
- Counselor, he's right.

01:27:27.094 --> 01:27:30.530
Some rules are made to help us,
not hurt us, and I...

01:27:30.731 --> 01:27:34.098
I do apologize,
Your Honor, and...

01:27:35.135 --> 01:27:39.663
I wanna fess up and reveal my source.

01:27:39.907 --> 01:27:43.001
Now tell me who was the
source of this videotape?

01:27:46.013 --> 01:27:48.413
- The samurai.
- Excuse me?

01:27:49.717 --> 01:27:51.651
The samurai gave me the tape.

01:27:52.419 --> 01:27:54.910
And who is this man,
and where is he?

01:27:55.122 --> 01:27:59.218
Unfortunately, he had a
critical groin injury on the way

01:27:59.426 --> 01:28:01.894
to give me the tape,
and he's undergoing

01:28:02.096 --> 01:28:04.997
acupuncture treatment in Beijing,
China right now.

01:28:05.199 --> 01:28:07.030
- It's okay, Alan.
- Mr. Flynt.

01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:11.493
This court fears that you're
seriously mentally ill.

01:28:11.705 --> 01:28:14.868
Opinions are like assholes:
Everybody's got one.

01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:16.906
- Cut it out.
- Shut up, Alan!

01:28:17.111 --> 01:28:18.476
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

01:28:18.712 --> 01:28:21.545
Mr. Flynt, you listen to you lawyer,
let your lawyer do the talking.

01:28:21.749 --> 01:28:24.240
No, I know the rules, okay?

01:28:24.718 --> 01:28:28.916
- You're fired. I'm representing myself...
- I am so tired of you. You're fired.

01:28:29.156 --> 01:28:32.523
- You can't fucking fire me!
- No cursing in this courtroom!

01:28:32.726 --> 01:28:33.693
What?

01:28:34.128 --> 01:28:36.119
- Larry Flynt...
- How about spitting?

01:28:37.197 --> 01:28:39.358
Marshal, put a gag on that man.

01:28:39.566 --> 01:28:41.363
- Sit down, sir.
- You bastard!

01:28:41.568 --> 01:28:44.264
Sit down, lady!
Be seated there in the back!

01:28:44.471 --> 01:28:47.133
- Get off me!
- Everybody down in this courtroom!

01:28:50.644 --> 01:28:55.513
All right, Mr. Flynt,
are you willing to calm down now, sir?

01:28:58.385 --> 01:28:59.977
If I take that gag off of you

01:29:00.187 --> 01:29:05.489
are you gonna show me and my staff and
the court the respect that we deserve?

01:29:05.692 --> 01:29:07.751
All right, marshal.

01:29:11.165 --> 01:29:14.999
- Fuck you, you son of a bitch!
- I've had enough of this.

01:29:15.469 --> 01:29:19.405
Larry Flynt, you leave me no choice
but to sentence you to 9 months.

01:29:19.606 --> 01:29:22.666
- Nine months? Is that all you got?
- Three more months.

01:29:22.876 --> 01:29:24.537
- Fuck you, Your Honor!
- Want more?

01:29:24.745 --> 01:29:26.838
- Larry, stop it.
- Sit down, lady!

01:29:28.115 --> 01:29:29.377
Larry Flynt...

01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:35.180
you are sentenced to 15 months
in a federal psychiatric prison.

01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:41.020
Hey, don't look at me.
Ask for bail, counselor.

01:29:41.695 --> 01:29:43.890
Can I post bail,
Your Honor?

01:29:44.698 --> 01:29:45.790
No!

01:29:46.567 --> 01:29:50.059
- Now get him out of my courtroom!
- Fucking bastard!

01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:55.264
Sir, you can say all of those foul words
behind four padded walls. Get him out!

01:30:21.902 --> 01:30:24.871
- Gentlemen.
- Something we'd like to show you, sir.

01:30:29.843 --> 01:30:31.674
I don't understand.

01:30:32.012 --> 01:30:35.175
The reverend would never
endorse a liquor company.

01:30:36.416 --> 01:30:39.783
- There's a larger problem.
- Substantially larger.

01:30:42.022 --> 01:30:45.958
You see, sir,
it says right there that the reverend...

01:30:47.794 --> 01:30:50.024
It says, sir...

01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:54.758
that he fornicated with his
mother in an outhouse.

01:30:56.904 --> 01:30:58.303
Give me a second.

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.975
Now, what do you boys
have for me today?

01:31:11.251 --> 01:31:15.620
Reverend, I think you need to read this.

01:31:31.772 --> 01:31:33.672
Give me your jacket, please.

01:31:41.748 --> 01:31:43.978
Jesus Christ.

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.685
Stand up, please.

01:31:55.862 --> 01:31:57.454
Raise your foot.

01:31:58.799 --> 01:32:00.858
- Arms up.
- Arms what?

01:32:01.101 --> 01:32:02.659
Arms up.

01:32:19.386 --> 01:32:20.683
Larry...

01:32:22.489 --> 01:32:25.686
you look so good.

01:32:29.162 --> 01:32:31.153
You look like shit.

01:32:32.532 --> 01:32:35.057
- What?
- Larry...

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:40.762
I don't want to work at
the magazine anymore.

01:32:40.974 --> 01:32:44.705
People there don't listen to me

01:32:44.911 --> 01:32:47.812
and they don't talk to me.

01:32:48.015 --> 01:32:50.745
They're afraid of me

01:32:51.585 --> 01:32:54.281
and they don't shake my hand.

01:32:54.688 --> 01:32:59.284
Larry, I went to Dr. Robert and...

01:33:03.630 --> 01:33:06.793
he... he told me that I was sick.

01:33:07.501 --> 01:33:11.096
I mean, sick-sick.

01:33:11.772 --> 01:33:15.503
I mean,
I got AIDS, Larry.

01:33:21.615 --> 01:33:24.607
They won't shake your hand?

01:33:28.021 --> 01:33:30.080
Yes, sir.
Yes.

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.057
Code pink.
Code pink.

01:33:36.063 --> 01:33:39.089
Code pink.
Code pink.

01:33:42.135 --> 01:33:45.127
Larry, it's Jimmy here.
You there?

01:33:45.338 --> 01:33:48.068
Larry?
Larry, you there?

01:33:48.275 --> 01:33:51.767
I have some important
announcements to make.

01:33:51.978 --> 01:33:55.675
- How's the hospital treating you?
- Never mind that.

01:33:55.882 --> 01:33:58.874
- Is everybody there?
- We're here, Larry.

01:33:59.086 --> 01:34:02.544
Good.
You're all fired.

01:34:04.291 --> 01:34:08.387
You can't just fire these people.
We need these people.

01:34:08.595 --> 01:34:13.692
Shut up! It's my business, and I'll
run it into the ground if I want to.

01:34:15.001 --> 01:34:16.901
Okay, that's all.
I gotta go.

01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:19.962
What the fuck was that?

01:34:21.408 --> 01:34:24.070
Just calm down, Arlo.
Don't panic on me.

01:34:24.277 --> 01:34:25.972
None of you guys are fired.

01:34:26.179 --> 01:34:30.115
- But Larry just said that...
- What did he say? He's in a nut house.

01:34:30.317 --> 01:34:32.308
You're not fired.
Is that a problem?

01:34:35.522 --> 01:34:37.786
Thank you.
Thanks.

01:34:41.128 --> 01:34:42.595
Jesus, Althea.

01:34:47.534 --> 01:34:51.026
Hi, hi. Come on,
sit down. Sit down.

01:34:53.306 --> 01:34:55.069
You all right, Mrs. Flynt?

01:34:55.408 --> 01:34:56.705
Fine, thanks.

01:35:01.915 --> 01:35:06.682
You look different. I don't know.
Did you change your hair?

01:35:07.721 --> 01:35:10.690
- Yeah, I changed my hair.
- Yeah, I like it.

01:35:11.191 --> 01:35:13.091
Yeah, my hair's different.

01:35:14.728 --> 01:35:16.252
So, what's up?

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.367
I got this the other day,
and I brought it by

01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:26.835
to see if you would look at it, please.

01:35:30.143 --> 01:35:32.703
Wow.
That is...

01:35:32.913 --> 01:35:35.404
- I mean, this is...
- It's intense.

01:35:36.049 --> 01:35:37.949
Yes, it is.

01:35:38.318 --> 01:35:40.081
What are we gonna do?

01:35:41.054 --> 01:35:45.753
- You're gonna give it to Larry's lawyers.
- Alan, you are our lawyers.

01:35:45.959 --> 01:35:50.623
You've always been our lawyers. You're
part of the family. Don't listen to Larry.

01:35:50.831 --> 01:35:54.426
- You know how he is.
- I don't know, Althea.

01:35:54.634 --> 01:35:56.568
We really need your help.

01:35:56.770 --> 01:35:59.568
Please, please help us.

01:35:59.773 --> 01:36:02.867
Please, please...

01:36:05.212 --> 01:36:06.440
Alan.

01:36:11.785 --> 01:36:16.245
Boy, this is great, Larry. This is
really great. I hope it was worth it.

01:36:16.623 --> 01:36:18.318
Didn't I fire you?

01:36:20.293 --> 01:36:24.889
Well, I've always ignored most
of what you've said, right?

01:36:29.002 --> 01:36:32.494
Listen, I know the timing is lousy

01:36:32.706 --> 01:36:35.937
but you remember
your little Campari ad?

01:36:36.142 --> 01:36:39.669
The Jerry Falwell in the outhouse
with his mother and...?

01:36:40.814 --> 01:36:42.509
He saw it.

01:36:42.716 --> 01:36:45.879
And I guess it's safe to say he...

01:36:46.219 --> 01:36:48.779
he didn't find it all that funny.

01:36:51.124 --> 01:36:53.592
He is suing you...

01:36:53.793 --> 01:36:57.957
for libel and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.

01:36:58.398 --> 01:37:01.561
And he is asking for 40 million dollars.

01:37:02.235 --> 01:37:05.068
This is Jerry Falwell in his home state.

01:37:08.341 --> 01:37:13.142
So if you're up to it, we really ought to
figure out how you want to deal with this.

01:37:17.183 --> 01:37:18.582
Countersue.

01:37:18.852 --> 01:37:21.548
- What?!
- Yeah, Jerry. He's suing you.

01:37:22.589 --> 01:37:26.491
He's suing me? For heaven's sakes,
on what grounds?

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:29.158
Well, you xeroxed his ad...

01:37:29.362 --> 01:37:31.922
and you sent it out in a
million fundraising letters.

01:37:32.132 --> 01:37:33.360
Yeah, so?

01:37:33.633 --> 01:37:37.194
But you didn't get his permission.
And that's copyright infringement.

01:37:39.839 --> 01:37:44.105
The depth of his depravity sickens me.

01:38:07.534 --> 01:38:10.503
They're gonna put you on the stand,
and your testimony is gonna...

01:38:10.704 --> 01:38:13.104
make or break us,
as always.

01:38:13.306 --> 01:38:15.638
So downplay how
much you hate Falwell.

01:38:15.842 --> 01:38:18.868
You've got to make them
understand that it was just a joke.

01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:19.843
I'm just a clown...

01:38:19.844 --> 01:38:22.800
Hey, take this seriously, Larry.
Don't fuck it up for yourself.

01:38:22.801 --> 01:38:25.700
This is gonna be the most expensive
case you've ever had if you lose.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.800
Okay!

01:38:40.266 --> 01:38:43.064
Reverend Falwell,
you're a preacher, is that right?

01:38:43.269 --> 01:38:44.463
Yes, I am.

01:38:44.804 --> 01:38:48.069
And as a preacher,
you speak to a fairly broad audience.

01:38:48.274 --> 01:38:52.074
You preach on television and on
your "Old-Time Gospel Radio Hour"?

01:38:52.278 --> 01:38:53.404
I do.

01:38:53.613 --> 01:38:56.047
So you've achieved a certain notoriety.

01:38:56.249 --> 01:39:00.276
One might say a national reputation
for your sermons and your opinions

01:39:00.487 --> 01:39:04.082
and ideas and your leadership
of the Moral Majority.

01:39:04.491 --> 01:39:07.551
Yes, our membership
is now over 5 million.

01:39:07.761 --> 01:39:12.357
But even beyond your membership,
really, you've been recognized

01:39:12.565 --> 01:39:14.726
and awarded for your
efforts all over America.

01:39:15.435 --> 01:39:18.268
I have a number of honorary degrees.

01:39:18.471 --> 01:39:22.100
In a recent poll of Good
Housekeeping magazine,

01:39:22.308 --> 01:39:25.471
I was voted Second
Most-Admired American

01:39:25.678 --> 01:39:27.373
behind President Reagan.

01:39:27.647 --> 01:39:29.740
Good Housekeeping?
That's...

01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:32.047
I mean, hey,
you're famous, right?

01:39:32.252 --> 01:39:34.584
Well, I suppose you could say that.

01:39:36.156 --> 01:39:39.125
Reverend Falwell, have you
ever had sex with your mother?

01:39:41.895 --> 01:39:44.887
- Absolutely not!
- Never? I mean, you never...

01:39:45.098 --> 01:39:47.623
never in the outhouse as
Hustler magazine suggested?

01:39:47.834 --> 01:39:50.496
That is an absurd question.

01:39:50.703 --> 01:39:55.037
My mother was a very godly woman

01:39:55.308 --> 01:39:57.674
and as close to a saint

01:39:57.877 --> 01:40:00.471
as anyone I have ever known.

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.908
I'm sure she was.

01:40:03.016 --> 01:40:05.450
Reverend, have you ever
preached while you were drunk?

01:40:05.652 --> 01:40:07.142
Drunk?
Never.

01:40:07.353 --> 01:40:08.320
Never?

01:40:09.355 --> 01:40:12.984
You never even had a few too many at
lunch and then went back on the radio?

01:40:13.193 --> 01:40:16.128
That is a totally outrageous suggestion.

01:40:16.329 --> 01:40:18.456
- Totally outrageous?
- Totally.

01:40:18.832 --> 01:40:21.323
You don't think that some people,
Reverend Falwell

01:40:21.534 --> 01:40:25.231
despite your reputation, might have
reason to believe you could do that?

01:40:25.438 --> 01:40:28.430
I would find that very
difficult to believe.

01:40:28.675 --> 01:40:30.438
So really,
what you're telling me...

01:40:30.643 --> 01:40:34.170
is that nobody could reasonably think
these statements about you were true?

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.042
Yes, that's what I've been saying.

01:40:38.084 --> 01:40:39.346
Okay.

01:40:39.552 --> 01:40:41.952
Reverend Falwell,
at the beginning of this trial

01:40:42.155 --> 01:40:45.454
Judge Kirk gave very specific
instructions to this jury, okay?

01:40:45.658 --> 01:40:49.685
She said, quote, "If a reasonable
person could not believe

01:40:49.896 --> 01:40:53.696
that Hustler magazine describes
actual facts about Jerry Falwell

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:56.698
then you must dismiss the libel claim."

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.470
Do you remember these instructions?

01:41:04.244 --> 01:41:07.179
Obviously not.
So I'm gonna ask you one more thing.

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.371
Why are you suing my client for libel?

01:41:09.883 --> 01:41:12.784
I am not a lawyer,
Mr. Isaacman.

01:41:14.387 --> 01:41:17.879
I am a lawyer, okay,
and I can't figure it out either.

01:41:18.424 --> 01:41:22.258
Would you state your full name
for the record, please, Mr. Flynt?

01:41:22.462 --> 01:41:25.954
Yes, sir.
Christopher Columbus

01:41:26.166 --> 01:41:30.865
Cornwallis IPQ Harvey HN Pagey Piu.

01:41:31.604 --> 01:41:34.732
That's very interesting,
but are you also known as Larry Flynt?

01:41:35.875 --> 01:41:39.504
A.k.a. Jesus H. Flynt, Esquire.

01:41:39.712 --> 01:41:41.703
For chrissakes.

01:41:42.182 --> 01:41:46.949
Are you the publisher and the
editor in chief of Hustler magazine?

01:41:47.153 --> 01:41:51.351
I am the publisher of the
most tasteless, sleaziest

01:41:51.558 --> 01:41:54.994
most disgusting, greatest porn
magazine on the face of the earth.

01:41:55.428 --> 01:41:57.055
Thank you.

01:41:57.263 --> 01:41:59.663
I have in my hand Exhibit B

01:41:59.866 --> 01:42:02.494
which is a typewritten
script of the Campari ad.

01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:07.538
When you approved this ad,
did you have any specific knowledge

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:10.436
that the Reverend Falwell
had ever engaged

01:42:10.643 --> 01:42:13.840
in sexual intercourse with his mother?

01:42:15.215 --> 01:42:16.876
No.
But...

01:42:17.083 --> 01:42:19.551
I have a photograph of Falwell

01:42:19.752 --> 01:42:22.949
having fellatio with a sheep.
Now, I don't think...

01:42:23.156 --> 01:42:26.853
Your Honor, my client is in a heavily
medicated, mentally agitated state.

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.153
We will stipulate that no
such document exists.

01:42:29.362 --> 01:42:31.694
I have it,
and Mr. Fartwell

01:42:32.198 --> 01:42:35.258
is a liar,
a glutton and a sheep-ophile.

01:42:35.468 --> 01:42:38.028
My client's name is Jerry Falwell!

01:42:38.238 --> 01:42:41.264
- Jerry Falwell!
- That's what I said, Jerry Fartwell!

01:42:41.474 --> 01:42:44.204
Are you trying to hold the
Reverend Falwell up to ridicule?

01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:46.037
- No, contempt.
- Scorn?

01:42:46.746 --> 01:42:48.976
- Truculent.
- Obloquy?

01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:58.589
God, my French is so rusty.

01:43:03.763 --> 01:43:05.060
I love her.

01:43:05.265 --> 01:43:07.460
- Quiet in the courtroom.
- I love you, baby.

01:43:07.667 --> 01:43:10.864
Jesus loves me.

01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:13.038
Mr. Flynt...

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.131
Do you have any aversion
to organized religion?

01:43:16.342 --> 01:43:19.505
- A virgin?
- No, aversion. You heard me.

01:43:19.712 --> 01:43:22.943
An aversion to organized religion.

01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:27.442
I... You bet your sweet ass I do.

01:43:27.654 --> 01:43:33.217
Does that gives you license to mock
the leaders of religious movements?

01:43:33.426 --> 01:43:35.121
Well, goddamn right.

01:43:35.328 --> 01:43:38.820
- Objection! Your Honor.
This is totally irrelevant! - Overruled.

01:43:39.299 --> 01:43:42.166
- Free expression is absolute.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

01:43:42.368 --> 01:43:43.926
Do you agree?

01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:46.770
Order.
Ma'am, if you can't control yourself

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.406
you're going to have to
leave the courtroom.

01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:51.440
So that it was your intention

01:43:51.644 --> 01:43:54.670
to hold Reverend Falwell
out to be a hypocrite?

01:43:54.881 --> 01:43:56.371
Wasn't it?

01:43:57.083 --> 01:43:59.608
Well, that's what he is.

01:43:59.819 --> 01:44:02.083
But didn't it occur to you

01:44:02.288 --> 01:44:06.247
that Reverend Falwell must have an
integrity that people can believe in

01:44:06.459 --> 01:44:09.451
if he is to practice his profession?

01:44:11.064 --> 01:44:12.588
Yeah.

01:44:13.633 --> 01:44:16.796
And it was your intent
to destroy that integrity

01:44:17.003 --> 01:44:19.995
and his livelihood if you could?

01:44:20.606 --> 01:44:23.040
To assassinate it.

01:44:31.851 --> 01:44:34.581
Hey, it's me.
It's a weird decision.

01:44:34.787 --> 01:44:37.847
- Well, get me Bill, quick.
- No, he's not guilty of libel.

01:44:38.057 --> 01:44:41.549
But he is guilty of "inflicting
emotional distress".

01:44:41.761 --> 01:44:43.752
Now Flynt has to pay him 200 grand!

01:44:43.996 --> 01:44:48.057
This ruling shows that nobody can
prostitute the First Amendment.

01:44:48.267 --> 01:44:52.465
Pornography has thrust its ugly
head into our everyday lives.

01:44:52.672 --> 01:44:56.836
The billion-dollar sex industry,
of which Larry Flynt

01:44:57.043 --> 01:44:58.874
is a self-described leader

01:44:59.078 --> 01:45:03.481
lust and greed have replaced
decency and morality.

01:45:03.683 --> 01:45:08.017
We must make a solemn
commitment to God Almighty

01:45:08.221 --> 01:45:11.884
to turn this nation around immediately.

01:45:12.191 --> 01:45:14.989
Fucking AIDS junkie.

01:45:15.862 --> 01:45:17.625
You crazy cripple.

01:45:18.731 --> 01:45:21.131
Listen, it's just not that funny.

01:45:21.334 --> 01:45:24.303
And I'm afraid it wasn't funny
the first time we printed it.

01:45:24.504 --> 01:45:27.598
Well, guys,
I'm certainly open to suggestions.

01:45:27.807 --> 01:45:30.275
I would suggest that if
we're going to recycle it

01:45:30.476 --> 01:45:32.740
that we replace the noun

01:45:41.421 --> 01:45:43.981
I thought I fired all of you.

01:45:44.724 --> 01:45:46.316
Jimmy...

01:45:49.429 --> 01:45:51.090
Come here.

01:45:55.501 --> 01:45:57.366
Larry...

01:45:57.970 --> 01:46:00.939
I'm sorry if I tried to run things

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.664
but...

01:46:02.875 --> 01:46:05.901
you know,
I was just trying to protect you.

01:46:07.914 --> 01:46:09.438
Come here.

01:46:10.783 --> 01:46:12.478
Closer.

01:46:14.821 --> 01:46:16.721
Come on.

01:46:22.462 --> 01:46:26.023
Don't sweat it, bro.
I love you.

01:46:27.033 --> 01:46:29.399
I love you too, man.

01:46:31.637 --> 01:46:34.663
Larry, you look great, man.

01:46:34.874 --> 01:46:38.139
Chester, you remember Althea?
Shake her hand.

01:46:38.845 --> 01:46:40.278
Hey, Althea, you...

01:46:40.746 --> 01:46:43.408
- Hi, Chester.
- Hi.

01:46:44.217 --> 01:46:46.378
Don't sneak up on us.
Give us a heart attack.

01:46:46.586 --> 01:46:48.952
Yeah, what the hell.
Shake Althea's hand.

01:46:49.155 --> 01:46:51.214
Althea, good to see you.

01:46:51.424 --> 01:46:53.654
- Welcome back.
- Hello, Faith.

01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.327
- Hi, Althea.
- What do you do?

01:46:55.628 --> 01:46:57.858
I'm a secretary.

01:46:58.965 --> 01:47:02.867
- Good to see you, Althea.
- Arlo, hi.

01:47:26.325 --> 01:47:28.122
Water.
Water...

01:47:41.374 --> 01:47:44.207
- I got it.
- No. I wanna take my bath.

01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:46.810
I wanna take my bath.

01:47:50.249 --> 01:47:53.810
Okay.
Why don't you hop on?

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.113
I'll give you a ride.

01:47:57.123 --> 01:47:58.852
Go ahead.

01:47:59.058 --> 01:48:00.650
Buckle up.

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.828
Daddy.

01:48:03.763 --> 01:48:05.458
Yes.

01:48:05.665 --> 01:48:08.634
You're crushing my legs!

01:48:11.571 --> 01:48:13.232
You're shivering, baby.

01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:17.031
Sorry.

01:48:17.243 --> 01:48:19.268
You're shivering.

01:48:22.214 --> 01:48:25.445
Detour!
Oh, no.

01:48:25.651 --> 01:48:28.814
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill us.

01:48:29.021 --> 01:48:32.616
It's okay.
They'll freeze us...

01:48:32.825 --> 01:48:35.123
and thaw us out in the year 3000.

01:48:38.497 --> 01:48:42.729
Curbside service.
That'll be $8.50, lady.

01:49:19.639 --> 01:49:22.164
Dr. Kipper, please.

01:49:22.975 --> 01:49:25.000
Larry Flynt.

01:49:28.714 --> 01:49:30.773
Dr. Kipper?

01:49:31.951 --> 01:49:34.215
She doesn't look good.

01:49:35.254 --> 01:49:39.850
Well, I know, but there's gotta
be something more we can do.

01:49:40.059 --> 01:49:43.085
Some new technology or drug.

01:49:43.295 --> 01:49:45.490
What are they doing in Europe?

01:49:45.698 --> 01:49:48.189
You know money's no object.

01:49:52.438 --> 01:49:54.338
Althea?

01:49:55.608 --> 01:49:57.633
Althea!

01:49:59.245 --> 01:50:02.043
Althea!

01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.217
Baby!

01:50:09.422 --> 01:50:11.185
Baby!

01:50:12.658 --> 01:50:14.649
Baby!

01:50:19.498 --> 01:50:20.829
Baby!

01:50:21.033 --> 01:50:22.694
Baby!

01:50:22.902 --> 01:50:25.063
No!
No!

01:50:25.838 --> 01:50:29.330
Baby!
Help!

01:50:29.542 --> 01:50:31.874
Help!

01:50:32.078 --> 01:50:33.841
Baby!

01:50:34.046 --> 01:50:36.014
No!
No.

01:50:48.894 --> 01:50:53.422
Jesus said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life.

01:50:53.632 --> 01:50:55.429
No man comes to the Father

01:50:55.901 --> 01:50:57.198
but by me.

01:50:57.403 --> 01:50:59.371
He that liveth

01:50:59.572 --> 01:51:02.905
and believeth in me shall never die.

01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:06.567
In my Father's house are many rooms.

01:51:06.779 --> 01:51:09.577
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

01:51:09.782 --> 01:51:13.878
I will come again and
receive you unto myself.

01:51:14.086 --> 01:51:17.954
That where I am,
there you may be also

01:51:18.157 --> 01:51:21.752
and you will live with me forever

01:51:21.961 --> 01:51:24.225
and ever."

01:51:29.502 --> 01:51:34.030
You cannot mock God.
You cannot fool God.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.765
If you violate his laws,

01:51:36.976 --> 01:51:39.911
God Almighty will judge you.

01:51:40.446 --> 01:51:42.778
AIDS is a plague.

01:51:43.849 --> 01:51:48.013
These perverted lifestyles have to stop.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:51.621
If you break moral laws

01:51:51.824 --> 01:51:53.451
you reap the whirlwind.

01:51:53.659 --> 01:51:56.924
Alan, it's Larry.

01:51:57.997 --> 01:52:00.591
I wanna appeal the Falwell case.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.290
This is over.
Over.

01:52:02.501 --> 01:52:05.595
- No, it's not over. We can go higher.
- Higher?

01:52:05.805 --> 01:52:07.773
The Supreme Court.

01:52:07.973 --> 01:52:09.463
- Yeah.
- Give them a call.

01:52:09.675 --> 01:52:13.202
It's not that simple, Larry.
It's not that simple.

01:52:13.445 --> 01:52:16.346
Thousands of people every year petition
the Supreme Court, okay, thousands?

01:52:16.549 --> 01:52:19.245
Now, our case is as good as any.

01:52:19.451 --> 01:52:21.942
Our case is better than most.
You're missing my point.

01:52:22.154 --> 01:52:25.954
My point is,
they will never pick you

01:52:26.158 --> 01:52:27.853
because you're a nightmare!

01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:31.962
They're afraid if they let you in court,
you'll wear a diaper or throw oranges.

01:52:32.164 --> 01:52:36.157
And they should be! In all the times
you've gone to court asking for help,

01:52:36.368 --> 01:52:40.202
you've never demonstrated respect
for its institutions and procedures.

01:52:40.406 --> 01:52:42.533
So as far as they're concerned,
you're just a pig.

01:52:42.741 --> 01:52:45.676
Yeah, well... You always said,
and it's the principle...

01:52:45.878 --> 01:52:48.176
"A pig has the same
rights as a president."

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.711
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's...

01:52:49.915 --> 01:52:53.942
- You know, people get tired of a pig.
- Bullshit! You're scared, Alan.

01:52:54.153 --> 01:52:57.054
You're scared.
You're letting these guys steamroll...

01:52:57.256 --> 01:53:01.488
Look, it's not just them.
Larry! Okay? It's me!

01:53:01.694 --> 01:53:03.855
It's me!
I am not taking you.

01:53:07.366 --> 01:53:12.303
Lawyers dream about a case like this in
front of the Supreme Court. Dream of it!

01:53:12.504 --> 01:53:14.938
They would probably hear us,
if you want the truth.

01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.109
But I am not going with you!

01:53:20.613 --> 01:53:25.016
I have been giving you my best since
back when people were laughing at you.

01:53:25.217 --> 01:53:29.517
And every time I come in there,
you fuck me with this circus act!

01:53:32.157 --> 01:53:34.819
I won't do it again.
I can't.

01:53:35.027 --> 01:53:38.300
I'm not gonna do it in front of the
Supreme Court of the United States.

01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.890
I'm just not.

01:53:38.898 --> 01:53:42.959
Your sentimental speeches
and your cornball patriotism

01:53:43.168 --> 01:53:46.968
they don't work on me anymore, Lar,
because I don't believe you.

01:53:52.645 --> 01:53:54.340
I don't believe you.

01:54:02.388 --> 01:54:04.288
Dude, you're my...

01:54:05.424 --> 01:54:08.154
my friend.
Alan.

01:54:09.862 --> 01:54:11.830
We're friends.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:19.133
You know, I just...
I would love to be remembered

01:54:19.338 --> 01:54:21.306
for something

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.766
meaningful.

01:54:27.046 --> 01:54:30.914
Any research problems,
I encourage you to use my archives.

01:54:31.717 --> 01:54:33.241
And...

01:54:33.452 --> 01:54:37.821
tell the reverend that I've dealt
with this filth monger myself

01:54:38.057 --> 01:54:40.321
and I wish to offer my support.

01:54:40.526 --> 01:54:42.994
Is that the Tin Man?

01:54:44.096 --> 01:54:45.154
Yes...

01:54:45.364 --> 01:54:47.264
that's the Tin Man.

01:54:48.367 --> 01:54:52.133
God versus the devil. America's
minister versus America's pimp.

01:54:52.338 --> 01:54:53.669
Today is the showdown.

01:54:53.872 --> 01:54:57.535
Many were surprised by the high
court's decision to hear Flynt's case,

01:54:57.743 --> 01:55:01.110
but he had some unlikely
supporters filing briefs on his behalf:

01:55:01.313 --> 01:55:04.874
like the New York Times, the American
Newspaper Publishers Association,

01:55:05.084 --> 01:55:07.882
and the Association of...
- All rise.

01:55:08.654 --> 01:55:11.851
The honorable, the chief justice
and the associate justices

01:55:12.057 --> 01:55:14.491
of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

01:55:14.693 --> 01:55:15.660
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:21.363
All persons having business before
the honorable U.S. Supreme Court

01:55:21.567 --> 01:55:24.934
are admonished to draw
near and give their attention.

01:55:25.137 --> 01:55:27.002
For this court is now sitting.

01:55:27.206 --> 01:55:30.972
God save the United States
and the Supreme Court.

01:55:37.649 --> 01:55:42.712
We'll hear the argument first
this morning in number 86-1278.

01:55:42.921 --> 01:55:47.221
Hustler magazine and Larry C.
Flynt v. Jerry Falwell.

01:55:47.426 --> 01:55:51.123
Mr. Isaacman, you may proceed
whenever you're ready.

01:55:59.004 --> 01:56:01.370
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

01:56:02.775 --> 01:56:07.235
One of the most cherished
ideas that we hold in this country

01:56:07.446 --> 01:56:10.347
is that there should be
uninhibited public debate

01:56:10.549 --> 01:56:12.779
and freedom of speech.

01:56:12.985 --> 01:56:15.715
Now, the question you have
before you today is whether

01:56:15.921 --> 01:56:20.221
a public figure's right to protection
from emotional distress

01:56:20.426 --> 01:56:23.122
should outweigh the public interest

01:56:23.328 --> 01:56:26.126
in allowing every citizen of this country

01:56:26.331 --> 01:56:28.663
to freely express his views.

01:56:28.867 --> 01:56:30.630
But what was

01:56:30.836 --> 01:56:33.896
the view expressed in Exhibit A?

01:56:35.874 --> 01:56:39.537
Well, to begin with,
this is a parody of a known Campari ad.

01:56:39.745 --> 01:56:41.975
- I understand. Go ahead.
- Okay.

01:56:42.181 --> 01:56:45.480
Also, and more importantly,
it was a satire of a public figure

01:56:45.684 --> 01:56:51.384
of Jerry Falwell, who in this case was
really a prime candidate for such a satire,

01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:54.889
because he's such an unlikely
person to appear in a liquor ad.

01:56:55.094 --> 01:56:59.292
This is a person that we are used to
seeing at the pulpit, Bible in hand,

01:56:59.498 --> 01:57:03.935
preaching with a famously
beatific smile on his face.

01:57:04.136 --> 01:57:07.333
But what is the public
interest you're describing?

01:57:07.539 --> 01:57:12.442
That there is some interest
in making him look ludicrous?

01:57:14.146 --> 01:57:18.173
Yes. There is a public interest in
making Falwell look ludicrous.

01:57:18.383 --> 01:57:22.285
Insofar as there is a public interest
in having Hustler magazine

01:57:22.488 --> 01:57:25.924
express the point of view
that Jerry Falwell is full of B.S.

01:57:26.758 --> 01:57:31.024
And Hustler magazine has
every right to express this view.

01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:33.630
They have the right to say

01:57:33.832 --> 01:57:36.995
that somebody, who has
campaigned against our magazine,

01:57:37.202 --> 01:57:39.136
who has told people not to buy it,

01:57:39.338 --> 01:57:43.536
who has publicly said it poisons
the minds of Americans,

01:57:43.742 --> 01:57:47.769
who, in addition,
has told people that sex out of wedlock

01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:50.744
is immoral,
that they shouldn't drink,

01:57:50.949 --> 01:57:54.441
Hustler magazine has a
First Amendment right

01:57:54.653 --> 01:57:57.281
to publicly respond to these comments.

01:57:57.489 --> 01:58:00.049
by saying that Jerry Falwell is full of B.S.

01:58:00.259 --> 01:58:04.753
It says, "Let's deflate this stuffed shirt
and bring him down to our level."

01:58:04.963 --> 01:58:07.124
Our level in this case being admittedly,

01:58:07.332 --> 01:58:11.200
a lower level than most people
would like to be brought to.

01:58:11.803 --> 01:58:15.569
I apologize. I know I'm not supposed
to joke, but that's sort of the point.

01:58:15.774 --> 01:58:19.107
Mr. Isaacman,
the First Amendment is not everything.

01:58:19.311 --> 01:58:23.008
It's a very important value, but it's
not the only value in our society.

01:58:23.215 --> 01:58:27.174
What about a value which says
good people can enter public life

01:58:27.386 --> 01:58:29.013
and public service?

01:58:29.321 --> 01:58:30.948
The rule you give us says

01:58:31.156 --> 01:58:34.922
that if you stand for public
office or become a public figure,

01:58:35.127 --> 01:58:37.789
you cannot protect yourself
or indeed your mother

01:58:37.996 --> 01:58:41.488
against a parody of your committing
incest with her in an outhouse.

01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:43.031
Do you think...

01:58:43.235 --> 01:58:47.331
George Washington would've stood for
office if that was the consequence?

01:58:47.539 --> 01:58:50.030
It's interesting you mention
Washington, Justice Scalia,

01:58:50.242 --> 01:58:53.177
because very recently,
I saw a political cartoon

01:58:53.378 --> 01:58:55.243
that's over 200 years old.

01:58:55.447 --> 01:58:56.971
It depicts George Washington

01:58:57.182 --> 01:58:59.810
riding on a donkey,
being led by a man

01:59:00.018 --> 01:59:04.079
and the caption suggests this man
is leading an ass to Washington.

01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:07.953
I can handle that.
I think George can handle that.

01:59:09.461 --> 01:59:14.763
But that's a far cry from committing
incest with your mother in an outhouse.

01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:19.094
I mean,
there's no line between the two?

01:59:21.607 --> 01:59:24.167
No, Justice Scalia.
There is no line between the two.

01:59:24.376 --> 01:59:27.868
Because what you're talking about
is a matter of taste, not law.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:32.312
As you yourself said,
I believe, in Pope v. Illinois:

01:59:32.517 --> 01:59:36.214
"It's useless to argue about taste and
even more useless to litigate it."

01:59:36.855 --> 01:59:40.382
And that is the case here.
The jury has already determined for us

01:59:40.692 --> 01:59:43.320
that this is a matter of taste
and not a matter of law,

01:59:43.528 --> 01:59:46.588
because they've said there's no
libelous speech. Nobody could

01:59:46.798 --> 01:59:50.632
believe Hustler was suggesting that
Falwell had sex with his mother.

01:59:50.836 --> 01:59:53.634
So why did Hustler have him
and his mother together?

01:59:54.273 --> 01:59:57.640
Hustler puts him and
his mother together

01:59:57.843 --> 02:00:01.574
in an example of literary travesty,
if you will.

02:00:01.947 --> 02:00:04.438
And what public purpose
does this serve?

02:00:05.317 --> 02:00:07.808
It serves the same
public purpose as having

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:11.512
Gary Trudeau say Reagan has no
brain or that George Bush is a wimp.

02:00:11.723 --> 02:00:14.453
It lets us look at public
figures a little differently.

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.857
We have a long tradition in this
country of satiric commentary.

02:00:18.063 --> 02:00:22.898
Now, if Jerry Falwell can sue when
there's been no libelous speech

02:00:23.101 --> 02:00:26.332
purely on emotional distress,
then so can other public figures.

02:00:26.538 --> 02:00:31.032
Imagine suits against people like
Gary Trudeau and Johnny Carson

02:00:31.243 --> 02:00:33.711
for what he says on The
Tonight Show tonight.

02:00:33.912 --> 02:00:37.279
Obviously, when people
criticize public figures,

02:00:37.482 --> 02:00:40.349
they're going to experience
emotional distress. We all know that.

02:00:40.552 --> 02:00:43.248
It's the easiest thing to claim
and impossible to refute.

02:00:43.455 --> 02:00:45.423
That's what makes it a
meaningless standard.

02:00:45.624 --> 02:00:49.993
Really, all it does is allow us
to punish unpopular speech.

02:00:50.195 --> 02:00:54.791
And this country is founded,
at least in part...

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.264
on the firm belief that unpopular speech

02:00:57.469 --> 02:01:00.836
is absolutely vital to
the health of our nation.

02:01:02.074 --> 02:01:03.405
Thank you,
Mr. Isaacman.

02:01:05.243 --> 02:01:07.734
Reverend, are you confident
you will win this case?

02:01:07.946 --> 02:01:09.038
Absolutely.

02:01:09.247 --> 02:01:13.081
There's no way the Supreme
Court will come down on the side

02:01:13.285 --> 02:01:15.150
of a sleaze merchant like Larry Flynt.

02:01:15.354 --> 02:01:17.584
Mr. Keating,
why are you here today?

02:01:17.789 --> 02:01:21.020
To support people who believe
pornography should be outlawed.

02:01:21.226 --> 02:01:25.458
Because if the First
Amendment will protect a...

02:01:25.764 --> 02:01:27.527
- What did Grutman call me?
- Scumbag.

02:01:27.933 --> 02:01:30.834
Scumbag like me, well,
then it will protect all of you.

02:01:32.371 --> 02:01:34.202
Because I'm the worst.

02:01:34.406 --> 02:01:36.374
Larry, do you have any regrets?

02:01:42.447 --> 02:01:43.436
Only one.

02:01:59.498 --> 02:02:01.261
Larry.

02:02:16.348 --> 02:02:18.077
Larry.

02:02:50.048 --> 02:02:51.743
Larry.

02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:21.478
- Hello?
- It's Alan.

02:03:21.947 --> 02:03:25.439
- They just brought the decision in.
- Well, is it good or bad?

02:03:26.418 --> 02:03:30.377
Well, it's a unanimous decision.
And Rehnquist wrote it himself.

02:03:30.755 --> 02:03:33.383
- Is it good or bad?
- I want you to hear this.

02:03:36.461 --> 02:03:38.156
"At the heart of the First Amendment

02:03:38.363 --> 02:03:42.823
is the recognition of the importance
of the free flow of ideas.

02:03:43.034 --> 02:03:46.629
Freedom to speak one's mind is not
only an aspect of individual liberty,

02:03:46.838 --> 02:03:49.329
but essential to the quest for truth

02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:52.510
and the vitality of society as a whole.

02:03:52.711 --> 02:03:54.440
In the world of debate
about public affairs,

02:03:54.646 --> 02:03:56.910
many things done with motives
that are less than admirable

02:03:57.115 --> 02:03:59.447
are nonetheless protected
by the First Amendment."

02:03:59.651 --> 02:04:01.175
So we won.

02:04:02.354 --> 02:04:03.719
Yes, we did.
We won.

02:04:04.556 --> 02:04:06.490
Thank you, Alan.

02:04:07.092 --> 02:04:09.617
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

02:04:15.267 --> 02:04:17.360
We won, baby.

02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.936
Strip for me, baby.

02:04:26.545 --> 02:04:28.172
Why?

02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:31.543
So when you're old and ugly,
you can look back at this.

02:04:33.618 --> 02:04:36.917
I'm never gonna be old and ugly, Larry.

02:04:37.122 --> 02:04:40.717
You're gonna be old and ugly.

02:04:41.305 --> 02:04:47.587
