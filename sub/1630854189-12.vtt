WEBVTT

00:03.062 --> 00:05.337
Danielle, your résumé
is very impressive.

00:05.564 --> 00:07.489
But we're not just
looking for a new baker,

00:07.566 --> 00:10.009
we're-we're looking for
a new member of the family.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.844
Oh, not me, I got
too much family.

00:12.071 --> 00:12.845
I need muffins.

00:13.072 --> 00:14.329
(Kat chuckles)

00:14.348 --> 00:15.681
See, Randi's the sassy
younger sister

00:15.832 --> 00:17.741
and I'm the cool older sister
where you're like,

00:17.910 --> 00:21.411
"She's valedictorian and makes
her own blue jeans? What?"

00:21.430 --> 00:23.856
(laughs) So, would you be able
to work an early morning shift?

00:24.007 --> 00:26.025
And more importantly,
if you were a bird,

00:26.101 --> 00:27.509
what kind of bird would you be?

00:27.603 --> 00:30.437
Oh, what does that
have to do with this job?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.272
Well, I'm just trying
to learn more about her.

00:32.441 --> 00:34.107
We don't want to spend
day after day

00:34.260 --> 00:36.276
with someone who's so annoying.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.779
Yeah, I wonder what that
would be like.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.207
I'm sorry, I don't understand
the bird question.

00:42.434 --> 00:46.003
Ha. Looks like we got
ourselves a dodo.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.605
So, Gideon,

00:48.624 --> 00:49.790
it says here you come from

00:49.942 --> 00:52.217
the second-largest Amish
community in Kentucky.

00:52.369 --> 00:56.204
It would have been the largest
if we believed in vaccines.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.614
It also says here

00:57.633 --> 00:59.633
that the only other job
you've ever had is

00:59.727 --> 01:01.118
"doing the Lord's work"?

01:01.211 --> 01:05.455
Oh, it's 24-7, but I've got
the best boss ever.

01:05.549 --> 01:07.791
So, what brings you
to Louisville?

01:07.884 --> 01:12.145
Well, I've lived in one place
my entire life and...

01:12.298 --> 01:14.073
I'm not sure I belong there.

01:14.224 --> 01:17.634
The menfolk laugh at me,
the womenfolk ignore me.

01:17.653 --> 01:21.062
I mean, I'm 40,
I should be a grandpa by now.

01:21.231 --> 01:24.157
Well, I get the "feeling
like you don't belong" thing.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.809
When I was in high school,

01:25.828 --> 01:29.070
I tried to start a clique for
people who weren't in cliques.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.480
Got squeezed out.

01:30.499 --> 01:32.591
Stupid Ashley and her eye patch.

01:32.818 --> 01:35.319
I swear it changed sides.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.321
Okay, well, thank you
for coming in.

01:37.339 --> 01:38.931
Wait, no, hang on, hang on.

01:39.158 --> 01:41.082
If you were a bird...

01:41.176 --> 01:43.176
what kind of bird would you be?

01:43.329 --> 01:45.270
I was thinking about that
this morning.

01:45.497 --> 01:48.273
I would be
the bluebird of happiness.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.334
Well,
tweedle-deedle-ding-dong-dee,

01:50.427 --> 01:52.444
that is the exact right answer!

01:52.613 --> 01:53.520
You're in!

01:53.614 --> 01:55.096
The running. (chuckles)

01:55.116 --> 01:57.023
Do you have a number
where we can reach you?

01:57.118 --> 01:58.433
Oh, well, I don't have a phone,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.677
but how about you just
go outside and yell,

02:00.696 --> 02:01.954
<i> "Ich hab en Kivvel"?</i>

02:02.105 --> 02:05.440
It means "I have a bucket,"
but we'll get it.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.941
Yeah, we will.

02:07.110 --> 02:08.352
-All right.
-Bye.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.504
Well, good luck with
your other interviews.

02:11.781 --> 02:13.114
-He's perfect!
-What?

02:13.208 --> 02:14.374
We've interviewed
over 20 people,

02:14.526 --> 02:16.042
and that's who you want to hire?

02:16.195 --> 02:17.636
His story is beautiful.

02:17.787 --> 02:20.364
Growing up Amish, wondering
what else is out there,

02:20.382 --> 02:22.382
learning in this very café
five minutes ago

02:22.534 --> 02:24.459
that women are allowed
to own businesses.

02:24.628 --> 02:26.370
Okay, so you remember
that woman Danielle

02:26.538 --> 02:29.039
who went to a culinary school
in Paris?

02:29.057 --> 02:30.298
Gideon's only reference

02:30.317 --> 02:33.393
is a basket weaver
named Old Jebediah.

02:33.545 --> 02:37.063
Randi, come on. I think I know
what he's going through.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.473
I mean, just two years ago,

02:38.567 --> 02:40.642
I decided I didn't want
to be a math professor

02:40.661 --> 02:42.327
and I wanted to own a cat café.

02:42.554 --> 02:44.479
Yeah, and everyone
judges you for it.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.665
Oh, please. Nobody judges me.

02:46.816 --> 02:47.958
Wha...?

02:52.898 --> 02:56.592
Okay, now I see why One-Eyed
Ashley squeezed your ass out.

02:57.753 --> 02:59.419
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:59.513 --> 03:02.239

03:02.332 --> 03:05.425

03:05.519 --> 03:08.745
Once again, Sheila, I grazed
against you in that elevator,

03:08.838 --> 03:11.748
but it was an accident
and I'm dating your daughter.

03:11.767 --> 03:13.266
It's just, there are three times

03:13.419 --> 03:15.176
as many women as men
at Valley Hills,

03:15.196 --> 03:18.513
and even I'm having trouble
standing out from the crowd.

03:18.607 --> 03:22.776
All those hussies
with their new hips.

03:22.945 --> 03:24.277
Well, I think you're beautiful.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.705
And you and me have more
in common than you think.

03:26.932 --> 03:27.948
I'm retired, too.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.857
You're unemployed.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.210
Tomato, potato.

03:31.361 --> 03:33.620
Want to party in my Pontiac?

03:33.772 --> 03:35.047
Is there anyone
you're interested in?

03:35.198 --> 03:38.275
I'm really hoping to get
to know this guy Rodrigo.

03:38.293 --> 03:41.327
Ooh, he's handsome, charming,
speaks Spanish.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.629
I don't know, there's
something exciting

03:42.798 --> 03:46.058
about a man who
can roll his Rs.

03:46.209 --> 03:51.713
(rolling Rs):
Burrito. In a Pontiac Fiero.

03:51.807 --> 03:53.974
Please move a chair away.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.976
So why don't you ask
this Rodrigo out?

03:56.128 --> 03:58.570
I would if I could get
a moment alone with him.

03:58.797 --> 04:00.797
He's always surrounded
by a bunch of women

04:00.799 --> 04:03.275
with visible diaper lines.

04:03.427 --> 04:04.968
You need to find
yourself a wingman.

04:04.987 --> 04:07.137
Someone who can distract
the competition

04:07.155 --> 04:08.080
so you can get closer to...

04:08.231 --> 04:11.083
(struggling to roll Rs):
Rodrigo.

04:11.234 --> 04:12.567
What are you doing?

04:12.661 --> 04:13.585
It's like this.

04:13.737 --> 04:15.495
(struggling to roll Rs):
Rodrigo.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.071
See? That easy.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.984
(rolling Rs):
My Fiero is right outside.

04:21.003 --> 04:23.077
(door opens)

04:23.097 --> 04:24.988
-Hey, guys.
-CARTER: Hey.
-Hi.

04:25.007 --> 04:26.598
Well, the search is over,

04:26.825 --> 04:29.009
we finally found our new baker.

04:29.161 --> 04:30.102
This is Gideon.

04:30.253 --> 04:32.012
-Hey.
-Hi, Gideon. Welcome.

04:32.164 --> 04:34.697
Wow, my first bar.

04:34.758 --> 04:36.775
And my second Black person.

04:36.926 --> 04:38.001
Excuse me?

04:38.094 --> 04:39.169
Amish.

04:39.187 --> 04:41.446
Oh. I loved you in<i> Kingpin.</i>

04:41.598 --> 04:43.857
Gideon is on a journey
of self-discovery.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.676
And as someone who recently
went through this myself,

04:46.678 --> 04:48.862
I am giddy to be his guide.

04:49.014 --> 04:50.938
(laughs) Hang on.

04:51.033 --> 04:53.199
Giddy. Gideon.

04:53.352 --> 04:54.442
Did you do that on purpose?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.036
Yeah, wordplay's
kind of my thing.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.445
(both laughing)

04:57.464 --> 05:01.525
Anyway, these are all
of my favorite people.

05:01.543 --> 05:03.242
Oh, and my mother.

05:03.395 --> 05:04.386
Whoa.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.139
You are so glamorous.

Are you a prostitute?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.486
I would take a half cord
of wood or a haircut.

05:21.563 --> 05:24.047
I'm in. How do you feel
about a mullet?

05:24.140 --> 05:25.882
Wait, no, no bartering,

Money is just fine.

Let him cut his hair.

05:29.054 --> 05:31.388
Hold up, this cupcake
doesn't have any frosting on it.

05:31.390 --> 05:34.407
Frosting is vanity,
and vanity is a sin.

So is drinking before noon,
but here we are.

05:37.396 --> 05:40.038
Gideon, frosting is not a sin.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.824
Yeah, and-and I know your faith
is important to you,

05:42.918 --> 05:44.992
but these
bible-inspired cookies,

05:45.087 --> 05:46.236
they're not really selling.

05:46.329 --> 05:48.088
But they're scripture-doodles.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.350
Well, they taste like
the cookies you get in hell.

Old Jebediah is right,

I don't learn nothing
without the switch.

06:00.552 --> 06:01.935
No, come on.

06:02.087 --> 06:04.604
No one expects you to get
everything right your first day.

06:04.756 --> 06:06.347
Look at me and the SATs.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.016
It took me two tries
to get a perfect score.

06:09.185 --> 06:10.260
Actually, it only took one,

06:10.353 --> 06:11.778
I'm just trying
to make him feel better.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.020
Aw, shucks.

06:13.115 --> 06:14.355
You're just being nice.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.433
And you're just being too hard
on yourself.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.693
People like you and me,
we beat ourselves up.

06:18.787 --> 06:20.194
But we don't have to.

06:20.272 --> 06:21.546
That's what Randi's for.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.198
If you love what you do,
it's not a job.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.444
Gosh it all to heck,
you're right.

06:27.537 --> 06:28.887
I'm gonna go back
to that kitchen

06:29.038 --> 06:33.100

no cap, bitches.

06:59.828 --> 07:01.253
She's a little
too full of herself

07:01.480 --> 07:03.663
since she went into remission.

07:03.815 --> 07:06.758
Wait, wait, did you bring us
here to be your wingmen?

07:06.985 --> 07:09.577
So that's why you asked
if I had Daisy Dukes.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.172
Oh, if I still had a car,
you'd be washing it.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.915

pieces of meat.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.583
Oh, speak for yourself.

Hey, I'm thinking about making
Gideon a dating profile.

Do you think it's safe to say
he's still a virgin?

07:26.021 --> 07:29.614
Girl, I wouldn't be surprised if
he's never seen himself naked.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.432
And why would you do that?

07:31.526 --> 07:33.601
Well, because he said one of the
reasons he left his community

07:33.770 --> 07:34.769
was to find love.

07:34.938 --> 07:36.529

All right, I'm coming in.

18:54.359 --> 18:55.541
I hope you're decent.

18:55.693 --> 18:59.595
What am I saying?
He wears pants under his pants.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.458
Hey.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.310
How are you doing?

19:06.462 --> 19:07.870
Okay, I guess.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.872
I had lunch in
the free sample aisle.

19:09.891 --> 19:13.634
Are you familiar with the
miracle called the Hot Pocket?

19:13.728 --> 19:16.970
On the eighth day, the Lord
made the Hot Pocket,

19:17.064 --> 19:18.805
and yea, it was good.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.100
Look, I know you're
upset about last night,

19:22.236 --> 19:23.494
but you really don't have to be.

19:23.721 --> 19:26.055
I am sorry for what I did.

19:26.190 --> 19:30.001
I hereby forswear all
the temptations of this world.

19:30.152 --> 19:33.671
Except for the cheese balls,
I can't give them up.

19:33.822 --> 19:35.080
It's okay.

19:35.175 --> 19:38.083
I'm not mad, Randi's not mad.

19:39.345 --> 19:43.239
I don't fit in here any better
than I did at home.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.727
Do you remember the island
of misfit toys from<i> Rudolph?</i>

19:48.763 --> 19:50.079
No.

19:50.097 --> 19:52.690
Damn it, that would've been
a sweet timesaver.

19:52.841 --> 19:58.178
Well, the point is,
you know, we're all misfits.

19:58.347 --> 20:01.106
We all feel like we don't
fit in sometimes.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.685
Not you, you're so cool.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.037
(laughing):
Oh, Gideon.

20:06.264 --> 20:09.281
See? Two days in the modern
world and you get it.

20:09.434 --> 20:12.043
(sighs)
Look, there are gonna be times

20:12.270 --> 20:14.361
when you feel lost and alone.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.881
But just remember
you have people

20:17.032 --> 20:19.275
who are gonna help you
get through it.

20:19.293 --> 20:20.943
I do?

20:20.962 --> 20:22.202
Yeah.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.796
And I'm one of them.

20:23.948 --> 20:26.373
You're too sweet to me.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.893
No, I mean it.

20:29.044 --> 20:31.687
I want you to stay.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.640
Then I'll stay.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.068
Good.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.904
Oh, still a hard pass.

20:40.131 --> 20:43.074
Ooh, but I'm ahead of Randi
two to one.
