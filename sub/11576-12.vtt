WEBVTT

00:06.883 --> 00:10.171
I never said goodbye to Hale.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.717
It was always "see ya later, "

00:11.929 --> 00:14.716
"talk to you,"
or nothing at all.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.269
Just that look between
old friends that says...

00:21.480 --> 00:23.732
"we'll be
together again soon."

00:26.944 --> 00:30.107
He was a man of complexities,

00:30.323 --> 00:36.910
a traditionalist
with a modern style.

00:37.121 --> 00:41.535
An old soul with the
optimism of one just born.

00:43.002 --> 00:48.292
Hale Santiago of Clan
Zamora forged his own path.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.333
He became a cop.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.509
And he liked
being called a cop.

00:57.141 --> 01:02.602
He befriended without
judgment or expectation.

01:02.813 --> 01:06.271
And he loved without bounds.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.865
And as Hale's closest
clan members sit

01:16.077 --> 01:18.864
with his body
in silent mourning...

01:20.373 --> 01:23.957
so we begin
the Day of Silence

01:24.168 --> 01:29.333
where we pay reverence to
our dear and departed Siren.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.643
I think I might scream.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.065
Whatever you need, Kenzi.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.190
I needed him alive.

01:54.991 --> 01:56.481
It will get better.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.316
It will.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.363
I promise.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.168
Maybe not for a long time.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.541
But, I will be there for you.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.889
lam yours.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.637
lam a Knight from
the Order of Raina.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.393
And I pledge my fealty.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.269
To my Queen.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.520
To you.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.602
Uh, of course.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.778
Wait, Kenzi, wait.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.612
Where do we begin, my liege?

02:44.832 --> 02:47.790
Life is hard when you
don ’t know who you are.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.085
It’s harder when you
don ’t know what you are.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.709
My love carries
a death sentence.

02:53.924 --> 02:58.714
I was lost for years.
Searching while hiding.

02:58.929 --> 03:02.968
Only to find out I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.640
I won 't hide anymore.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.969
I will live
the life I choose.

03:14.070 --> 03:15.810
So you say you're
here to see me.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.817
I arrived just in time, for
l was attacked on my way here.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.489
Attacked by whom?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.942
Someone who would not want
me to deliver my message.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.868
You are in danger, My Queen.

03:25.081 --> 03:29.290
I am here to protect you,
and to fight by your side.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.164
I haven't seen these
since the battlefield.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.460
It's been a long time.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.798
Look, I don't know you.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.292
And I don't know what
you're talking about,

03:36.509 --> 03:39.342
but I do know that
lam not your Queen.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.464
So you can be dismissed.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.171
I am talking
about mortal danger.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.724
Okay, we just got
back from a funeral.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.267
Do you get that?

03:48.479 --> 03:51.266
There will be more funerals
if you do not heed my message.

03:51.482 --> 03:54.019
It was foretold that with
the death of the Una Mens,

03:54.235 --> 03:55.475
the Pyrippus would rise.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.730
It is you he seeks.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.778
Here.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.984
He shall rise and seek
Her out, The Succubus,

04:05.204 --> 04:06.114
The One.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.445
What does he want?

04:07.665 --> 04:09.246
To that information,
I am not privy.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.494
But the prophecy says
the slaying of the Una Mens

04:11.710 --> 04:13.746
also creates the power
of The Origin Seed--

04:13.963 --> 04:16.249
Not now Dyson.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.296
The prophecy says there
is very little time.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.798
Look. I don't give a shit
about prophecies or seeds

04:24.014 --> 04:25.800
or Pyrippuses.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.268
This is my family.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.342
And they need me.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.187
Kenzi.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.140
Bo we have to get him.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.726
He has to die.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.772
He will pay.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.482
I promise.

04:53.127 --> 05:02.468
Wormwood. Castor oil. Yes
and just a sprinkle of pepper.

05:10.519 --> 05:14.137
Well well well, look
what the puss dragged in.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.516
Looking for something?

05:15.733 --> 05:17.189
It still has Hale's blood.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.686
So when l slit your throat,

05:18.903 --> 05:20.939
think of it as a
gift from us both.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.113
You didn't really just come
here to kill me did you?

05:24.325 --> 05:26.441
Why else?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.197
You know, for supernatural
creatures and all that,

05:29.413 --> 05:30.448
you guys don't know shit

05:30.664 --> 05:32.655
about what's going
on in your own lives.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.912
I suppose you know
nothing about Rainer dying.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.210
And soon too.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.788
What about Rainer?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.043
When the Wanderer rises

05:42.259 --> 05:43.795
another curse shall
befall him. In seven

05:44.011 --> 05:47.253
days he will expire
unless the curse is broken.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.009
It's in your history, moron.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.886
Where is the twig of Zamora?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.183
Oh god you are so annoying.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.307
You know I did Hale a solid when
I drove that sword into him.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.435
Can you imagine
the disappointment

05:58.651 --> 06:00.767
that he would
have eventually felt,

06:00.986 --> 06:03.944
knowing that he
was forever bound

06:04.156 --> 06:09.150
to your pathetic,
weak, human ass.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.826
Uggghhh!

06:13.082 --> 06:15.289
What else do you
know about Rainer?

06:15.501 --> 06:18.868
A little of this
and a little of that.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.372
(g rowls)

06:23.008 --> 06:25.875
Tell me.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.962
You will watch friends
die and do nothing about it.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.639
We can't kill him, yet.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.810
What?

06:38.023 --> 06:38.887
Why not?

06:39.108 --> 06:41.815
What did this gut
rot just say to you?

06:42.027 --> 06:44.234
I need to take him to Trick.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.777
No, Dyson no!

06:45.990 --> 06:48.026
Kenzi, do you think I
don't want to tear his heart

06:48.242 --> 06:50.028
out and eat it
in front of him?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.609
I do!

06:51.829 --> 06:55.697
But there are larger things
at stake here than revenge.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.203
Bo, please.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.207
He will suffer Kenzi,
Dyson will make sure of it.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.754
No, you promised me.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.547
You promised me
that he would die!

07:05.759 --> 07:08.796
But if Massimo has
information that can help us--

07:09.013 --> 07:11.345
First you betray me,
now Dyson betrays me.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.137
Dyson loves you.

07:12.349 --> 07:12.929
No.

07:13.142 --> 07:15.178
Kenzi, we have to trust him.

07:21.317 --> 07:25.435
Hey Rainer, Wanderer, Asshole,
whatever your name is.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.270
You have got to
be in here somewhere.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.028
History keeps a record
of everyone and everything.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.074
What the hell?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.463
Hello.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.551
Behold the demon
beast, evil pure.

07:51.764 --> 07:57.475
Fanged teeth. Horned.
Him they call Rainer.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.347
Gotcha.

08:00.689 --> 08:06.229
Thousand years shall be
ended, he shall be unbound.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.150
Okay.

08:07.363 --> 08:12.198
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.276
To wreak torment
beyond comparison,

08:15.496 --> 08:17.908
and betray the Fae.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.409
I knew it. |--

08:20.834 --> 08:23.120
You thinkjust because
the Una Mens went tits up

08:23.337 --> 08:25.043
that things'll just
fall into place?

08:25.255 --> 08:26.119
No.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.080
We need to intervene.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.009
Bo and this Wanderer freak--
they took out the Una Mens.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.462
Probably the heir
of Zamora too.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.546
It's only a matter
of time before

08:35.766 --> 08:38.098
they come after me, after you.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.518
Everything would be easier
if the Succubus was dead.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.017
Bo.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.661
Evony, you're not going
to kill my granddaughter.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.580
You and your
obsession with family.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.954
I warned you about
her from the start.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.206
Look, I've missed Hale's
Day of Silence for this

09:07.423 --> 09:09.414
so let's make
it worth my while.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.090
Ah yes, the Siren.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.510
Bit of a stick in
the mud, wasn't he?

09:15.723 --> 09:18.556
He was a better leader than
either of us will ever be.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.473
Speaking of Rainer.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.268
Shall we figure out
what to do with him?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.438
First we have to put
our differences aside.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.765
For now.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.148
Alright, but that's no fun.

09:34.158 --> 09:38.618
Rainer, Massimo said
that you were dying.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.945
But I think someone
has the answer.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.455
Rosette...

09:45.711 --> 09:46.951
She was my best lieutenant.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.913
Spent every moment trying
to get us off that train.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.167
And I failed you, sir.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.133
No.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.469
Well maybe you
can help us now.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.214
All these prophecies
that you keep spouting,

09:56.430 --> 09:58.045
is there anything
about Rainer dying?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.471
That would be impossible.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.344
The alliance between
you both would have assured

10:01.560 --> 10:03.096
that the earthly
curse was lifted.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.347
What earthly curse?

10:04.563 --> 10:05.473
What alliance?

10:05.689 --> 10:07.554
TAMSIN: If The Wanderer is
rescued, and the first curse

10:07.775 --> 10:10.232
TAMSIN: should fail,
he shall be cursed again.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.981
To suffer and perish
within seven days

10:13.197 --> 10:15.438
of being on this Earth.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.194
Crap. He's been here six days.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.535
So in case the first
curse was broken,

10:21.747 --> 10:25.285
a fail-safe was built in
by the person who cursed him.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.786
Trick.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.493
And only by the blood of your
enemy can the curse be broken.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.125
Trick's blood is in me.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.582
What is it with
my family and blood?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.133
So we can break the curse.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.210
And maybe find the Pyrippus.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.840
The one that's
been manipulating me.

10:40.057 --> 10:44.050
The one whose ass I'm going
to kick when | find him.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.646
Which is how?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.938
We need something that
both you and Rainer shared.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.017
A symbol. A clue.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.439
There is one thing.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.865
So to keep Rainer from dying
in the next twenty-four hours,

11:04.081 --> 11:05.116
and to find the
Pyrippus that we think

11:05.332 --> 11:07.789
is screwing with
all of our lives,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.502
we need to officially
form an "allegiance"

11:09.711 --> 11:12.874
and our only clue
is this tarot card.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.459
The purpose of a
Tarot Card is to guide

11:15.676 --> 11:18.543
so perhaps there's
a message in it.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.798
Yeah. The card revealed
itself as a ticket when

11:21.014 --> 11:23.266
Kenzi touched
it and it burned.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.428
Then we go old school.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.115
MMXV. 2015.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.616
The same thing
happened to Kenzi!

11:47.833 --> 11:50.415
It's a time. 8:15.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.037
Or it could be
something different.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.290
A code or a date.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.293
It could be cartography
coordinates.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.501
We need to talk.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.896
Fangs, horns?

12:10.105 --> 12:13.268
Obviously this Wanderer
is not the guy in my kitchen.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.020
This book doesn't even look
real. Is the ink still wet?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.851
That confused me too.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.277
But look, then I remembered,

12:19.489 --> 12:22.071
there was no memory
of Rainer. Right?

12:22.284 --> 12:22.739
Okay.

12:22.951 --> 12:23.656
LAUREN: Okay.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.450
When his memory returned,
history's memory of him

12:25.662 --> 12:27.323
returned as well.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.530
And it's not pretty.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.160
Look.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.458
The Warrior shall
escape his curse.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.706
The Valkyrie
shall be reborn.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.960
The blood of Zamoran
shall be spilled.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.838
Any of this sound
familiar to you?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.966
The women of the
horse shall rise.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.343
I don't have any
idea what that means.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.675
Between the Warrior
and the Queen,

12:49.895 --> 12:51.556
one of the two shall die.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.637
I haven't determined
who this queen is but--

12:53.857 --> 12:54.937
Yeah, they think it's me.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.686
Holy shit, Bo.
Then it's coming true.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.688
Don't you see, we have
gotta get you out of here.

12:58.904 --> 12:59.939
Why are you doing this?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.235
Something is coming for you.

13:01.448 --> 13:01.857
The Morrigan--

13:02.074 --> 13:04.611
To get back at me?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.317
I stayed with
the Dark for you.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.526
What?

13:08.747 --> 13:11.113
| isolated myself for you.

13:11.333 --> 13:11.958
This was all for you.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.159
Everything that
I do is for you.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.463
Except tell me your
plan. Or the truth!

13:20.676 --> 13:22.212
I had to make you believe it,

13:22.427 --> 13:24.509
if I was going make
The Morrigan believe it.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.677
I can't even hear
this right now.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.970
There's too much going on.

13:28.183 --> 13:31.016
Kenzi is hurting so
badly and where were you?

13:32.104 --> 13:34.720
Playing around in the Dark
archives digging up shit on the

13:34.940 --> 13:38.649
man somehow intertwined
with my destiny.

13:38.860 --> 13:43.149
So that's it. Hm.
You choose him?

13:43.365 --> 13:46.653
It is not like that.

13:46.868 --> 13:51.282
I chose you. And
you broke my heart.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.004
Whenever you're ready, Bo,

14:02.217 --> 14:04.629
I think I've
figured something out.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.852
I booked Serge
three months ago

14:20.068 --> 14:22.525
and this puss-puss
isn't gonna wax itself

14:22.738 --> 14:25.901
so I don't care how sick his
mother is, you make it happen.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.447
Lauren.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.615
Make yourself at my home.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.238
We're celebrating.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.991
We are?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.117
Heavens, Doctor,
what did you do?

14:35.333 --> 14:37.119
Discover a new spore?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.075
I want to join the Dark.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.911
Officially.

14:45.260 --> 14:50.345
Changes of heart
don't happen for no reason.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.014
I'm a human in a Fae world.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.016
Something that's been difficult
to reconcile over the years.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.144
Something that's made
me feel weak and small.

15:02.360 --> 15:07.525
And you've given
me strength. Confidence.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.107
Oh, you're not
falling in love with me,

15:10.327 --> 15:11.442
are you?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.913
You know, The Light
kept me imprisoned.

15:14.122 --> 15:18.582
They made me wear a dog
collar disguised as a necklace.

15:18.794 --> 15:23.128
The Dark gave
me respect. Freedom.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.376
Trusted me
with their research.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.171
You could sell
diapers to a sumo.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.878
Do you know that...

15:33.850 --> 15:37.889
| feel more like myself
than I have in years.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.471
Will you claim me?

15:40.690 --> 15:46.276
Honey, I don't need to
claim your clam to claim you.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.775
Why don't you tell me
what this is really about?

15:52.994 --> 15:55.121
Truth?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.286
l have nowhere else to go.

16:03.171 --> 16:08.632
Look, I'm not asking
you to be my girlfriend.

16:08.844 --> 16:13.133
But I might want
some of the benefits.

16:13.348 --> 16:17.307
l have never
understood you humans.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.352
But you are fun to play with.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.703
The women of the horses.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.041
Welcome.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.592
I am Sister Epona.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.920
What is it
you seek, children?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.176
My Queen, stand back.

16:58.810 --> 16:59.640
Rosette, stand down!

16:59.853 --> 17:01.093
This is the
one that attacked me

17:01.313 --> 17:02.928
when I arrived in your world.

17:03.148 --> 17:06.140
I've never seen
this girl in my life.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.905
You are more beautiful
than I expected.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.985
What's with the horse?

17:19.206 --> 17:21.037
The horse.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.616
The great and all-powerful.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.873
With dominion
over life and death.

17:28.089 --> 17:33.049
Only the mighty one will denote
the worthy from the fallen.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.252
But if you find it--

17:35.472 --> 17:36.757
Find what?

17:36.973 --> 17:38.088
Your blood will destroy him.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.263
He must be protected.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.386
Protected from who?

17:40.602 --> 17:43.594
The Succubus. You.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.019
What about me?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.097
The daughter's
intentions are unclear.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.932
Daughter?

17:51.321 --> 17:53.027
Pyrippus...

17:54.866 --> 17:55.776
Is he--?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.607
Your father.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.415
So, what should
we do then darling?

18:13.635 --> 18:18.174
My vote, we get rip-roaring
drunk and settling into a stack

18:18.390 --> 18:20.802
of oh I dunno, something
Rachel McAdams-y,

18:21.017 --> 18:23.053
I didn't call
you for cuddles, Vex.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.430
I need to get revenge.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.271
Oh, absolutely.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.266
Revenge is my middle name.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.471
Well, second middle actually.

18:28.692 --> 18:29.977
After Chauncey.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.558
It's a family thing,
don't judge.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.394
I'm talking blood
spilled, guts, pain.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.445
I'm talking payback.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.192
Stop.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.774
You're givin' me a stiffy.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.952
Alright, tell Uncle Vex.
Who's the unfortunate sot

18:42.163 --> 18:43.448
that's gonna meet
his untimely end?

18:43.665 --> 18:45.121
His name is Massimo.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.121
(laughs) That low
level teabag human druid?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.749
How in the world did
he manage to kill Hale?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.705
He had the twig of Zamora.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.211
What stupid idiot
gave that to him?

18:58.430 --> 18:58.589
Me.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.921
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.256
Do you even know where he is?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.557
I know exactly where
he is, he's in The Lair.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.055
And you are the only
one that can help me.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.182
So come on.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.309
Listen, you're putting
me in a real fix here,

19:10.525 --> 19:12.766
you understand?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.522
Honesty's not my strong suit,

19:14.738 --> 19:16.103
you know that, love.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.655
I'm not a good Fae.
Screw or be screwed.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.109
You're having a crisis
of conscience now?

19:22.329 --> 19:25.913
Vex, I need the real you.

19:26.124 --> 19:31.960
Killer, crooked, cocky,
dirty-til-the-death Vex.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.629
Okay. Okay.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.377
We'll take out this
crumpet muncher, Massimo.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.677
But! Let me
handle him, alright?

19:40.889 --> 19:43.255
|'|| Instagram you every
gratuitous little bloody tick.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.716
|n Kelvin 'cause
it's my favourite filter.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.893
Vex, I know you're
trying to protect me,

19:49.105 --> 19:51.266
but that insect killed
my almost husband.

19:51.483 --> 19:55.567
He took my happiness, and my
future, so this one is mine.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.236
Alright.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.404
What is this thing that I'm not
supposed to get my hands on?

20:07.624 --> 20:10.240
And what does it have
to do with your father?

20:11.920 --> 20:14.957
In my dawning, I saw a horse.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.960
In the room where my
father held me as a baby.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.963
Last year l was haunted
by visions of a carousel.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.589
They were all clues.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.091
He wants to meet you.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.093
Well he never has before.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.640
I've been waiting to meet him

20:27.852 --> 20:29.763
my whole life and
now I am terrified.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.810
Because terrible things
have been said about him.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.309
For a reason.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.232
So I have heard.

20:38.113 --> 20:42.527
If he is evil, then a part
of me must be evil as well.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.118
Come on.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.488
Look at how the
history books painted me;

20:46.704 --> 20:47.955
malevolent and depraved.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.779
A beast.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.332
History really likes the ugly.

20:53.545 --> 20:57.003
My Queen, I must tell you,
according to the prophecy,

20:57.215 --> 20:59.456
your alliance with Rainer
will release your father

20:59.676 --> 21:00.882
from his prison.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.129
He's imprisoned?

21:02.345 --> 21:03.130
Why?

21:03.346 --> 21:04.961
By who?

21:08.101 --> 21:09.637
I don't know what to do.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.936
If we align, then you live
but my father will be released.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.729
And because you
know nothing about him,

21:14.941 --> 21:17.023
the danger may be too great.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.039
You buggered up big style.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.373
It must have been horrifying.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.749
if you survived that fire.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.555
Every inch of
my body was searing,

21:48.766 --> 21:51.257
I could smell the stench.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.433
My stench.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.227
Burning flesh and hair

21:55.440 --> 21:58.853
and sweat that burned
the instant it appeared.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.951
But I prevailed.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.904
Thanks to your boyfriend.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.113
My fiancé.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.620
Even better.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.294
Where is the twig of Zamora?

22:20.507 --> 22:23.123
Oh, can't say.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.924
You'll understand
the irony of that

22:25.136 --> 22:27.172
once I've cut out
your pretty little tongue.

22:27.388 --> 22:27.968
Ow.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.796
Vexie.

22:32.393 --> 22:32.973
I'm

I

22:33.186 --> 22:35.427
but... this hot mess is mine.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.183
Yours?

22:37.398 --> 22:39.605
This psychopath
killed our Hale.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.773
I know.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.772
But his mum
abandoned him, and

22:43.988 --> 22:47.025
I gave my blood
oath to take him in.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.608
I mean he used to
curl up at my feet,

22:49.827 --> 22:54.116
then stab them with forks,
but, like a fine mold,

22:54.332 --> 22:56.243
he grows on you.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.622
I bought you your own shop of
herbal druidic shite and still

22:59.837 --> 23:02.123
you're nothing but
aggro, you little muppet.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.548
I'm so sick of you Fae
and your blood oath bullshit.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.473
So you wanna feel what
burning flesh feels like?

23:16.688 --> 23:19.896
Let me deal.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.099
I do every
thing else for you,

23:22.318 --> 23:26.277
so just get out
before I change my mind.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.066
No!

23:33.329 --> 23:36.742
I'm sorry, Kenz, but we
all got our burdens to bear.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.794
No.

23:47.677 --> 23:57.723
(groaning and panting)

23:57.937 --> 24:01.270
It's like being a
virgin all over again.

24:01.482 --> 24:04.724
Lauren... Who knew?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.026
Well the doctor is in.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.398
Uh, I can't believe
I just said that.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.152
(laughing)

24:13.995 --> 24:16.611
Oh.

24:16.831 --> 24:17.581
What?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.123
Ew. Salt.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.078
Ugh, s-so much salt.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.249
You're sweating.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.425
Good sex'll do that.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.056
No.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.884
Not to me.

24:40.104 --> 24:43.437
Never me.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.115
Why do | feel weird?

24:54.327 --> 24:59.697
Because Evony...
you've been transformed.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.157
Welcome to my world.

25:02.377 --> 25:05.540
You are one
hundred percent human.

25:16.224 --> 25:19.182
Are you trying to melt me?

25:19.394 --> 25:21.601
That's adorable.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.180
How?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.312
| used your own DNA to create
the serum that transformed you.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.608
What serum?

25:29.821 --> 25:32.312
Ow, forgotten already?

25:32.532 --> 25:35.740
It's only twenty minutes
ago you were down there.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.863
Oh.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.489
Oh.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.413
You know, books will
be written about this.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.491
I'll write the
first one of course.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.997
It'll be called
"The Lewis Solution

25:47.213 --> 25:48.623
for Difficult Fae."

25:48.840 --> 25:50.046
Shit.

25:50.258 --> 25:50.747
Something's happening?

25:50.967 --> 25:52.082
Something's on my nose.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.086
Get it off.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.465
You have an itch.
Humans do that.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.095
Hm.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.269
Bo has a soft
spot for humans.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.814
Her distrust just falls
away, as do her panties.

26:09.026 --> 26:13.770
She'll grow to like me, see
that we have so much in common.

26:13.990 --> 26:19.201
For example, both of us'll
obviously screw anything.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.322
Oooowwww.

26:21.539 --> 26:22.745
Sorry.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.746
You know, I'm not sorry.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.203
I was going to prick you but...

26:34.260 --> 26:36.000
this works too.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.763
You know, an experiment
of this magnitude

26:40.975 --> 26:43.967
could be very risky for you.

26:44.187 --> 26:46.143
Your system could accept the
sudden and all-encompassing

26:46.355 --> 26:48.311
changes very well.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.900
Or...

26:50.109 --> 26:54.648
Or... it could all wear off

26:54.864 --> 26:57.822
and you'll be dead
within the hour.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.869
All this talk of destiny.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.580
Dyson, I am being
pulled in every direction,

27:16.719 --> 27:20.257
I don't know, Bo.
This one is your call.

27:20.473 --> 27:24.762
Oh Dyson. Did we
do the right thing?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.592
With Massimo?

27:26.813 --> 27:30.226
Kenzi is hurting so
badly and we let her down.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.729
Trick's good at
hiding the real stuff.

27:34.946 --> 27:37.153
But not that good.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.401
Okay. Let's drink.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.202
A little to remember
the good stuff,

27:45.414 --> 27:47.826
a lot to forget the bad.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.919
You gonna open that or what?

27:58.135 --> 28:00.171
It's the Zamoran family code.

28:00.388 --> 28:03.505
Although I don't know
why Hale gave it to me.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.352
Complexity, courage,
strength, and beauty;

28:10.565 --> 28:11.850
Mindful always of your duty;

28:12.066 --> 28:14.682
To ties of blood
and those we love;

28:14.902 --> 28:16.483
With gentle hands,
wings of a dove;

28:16.696 --> 28:20.689
Ready thyself,
on guard, be keen.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.523
It's not much of a poem.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.405
It inspired Hale
when he was a child.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.117
Are you guys seeing this?

28:32.336 --> 28:34.713
Ready thyself,
on guard; be keen;

28:34.922 --> 28:38.380
To reunite with me, The Queen.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.254
Well, there's your rhyme.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.175
Zamora poetry.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.253
Rainer remembered;
history re-writing itself.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.849
What's next?

28:46.058 --> 28:48.049
Ta-da.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.805
I know this crest.

28:50.021 --> 28:52.603
It's from the Order
of the Knights of Raina.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.771
It means loyalty.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.318
To their queen.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.737
Not just their queen.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.689
The Queen.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.038
When I was collecting
souls on the battlefield;

29:08.247 --> 29:09.828
knowing who served whom

29:10.041 --> 29:14.660
I had to memorize
every crest there ever was.

29:14.879 --> 29:17.416
See this crown, how it
hovers over the coat of arms?

29:17.632 --> 29:20.465
And the bee, the queen bee.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.665
Literally.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.172
They think that I'm that queen.

29:25.890 --> 29:29.929
No, Bo. It's so
much more than that.

29:31.771 --> 29:35.764
"The Queen" doesn't
just mean "The Queen".

29:37.360 --> 29:39.646
Bo it means you're The One.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.527
Alright, I've made a call
to a friend, in Warwickshire.

29:45.743 --> 29:46.402
Bill.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.530
Famous playwright, nice guy.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.203
We're gonna stay with
him until things blow over.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.700
Flight's are booked.

29:52.917 --> 29:53.997
So come on, let's go.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.541
No, no I can't leave now.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.118
Not until it's finished.

29:57.338 --> 30:00.751
You killed the heir of Zamora,
you unappreciative little shit.

30:03.052 --> 30:06.010
No wonder your
mummy didn't want you.

30:11.435 --> 30:14.973
What am I gonna
do with you, eh Mo?

30:15.189 --> 30:15.939
You were such
a wee thing when

30:16.148 --> 30:18.230
your mum dropped
you off with me.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.979
I tried everything I
could to raise you right.

30:21.195 --> 30:26.030
Didn't I feed you proper, eh?
Teach you everything I know?

30:26.242 --> 30:29.154
It still wasn't good
enough for you, is it?

30:29.370 --> 30:34.114
Every little psycho
needs their Mummy.

30:34.333 --> 30:39.373
'Cept now I think
I'm all you've got left.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.919
Please Mo.

30:41.132 --> 30:43.214
Come to England with me.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.041
Just you and me.

30:45.261 --> 30:48.378
As it's always been.

30:50.558 --> 30:53.220
There ya go, that's my boy.

30:53.436 --> 30:54.926
Bill's a lovely guy.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.511
Just don't mention
Hamlet to him, alright?

30:56.731 --> 30:58.141
He's obsessed
with the ending.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.688
Thinks it should've
gone the other way.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.935
Come on.

31:01.152 --> 31:06.021
(phone ringing)

31:06.240 --> 31:07.855
Please.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.406
No.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.576
It's only gonna end badly.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.289
Please, Mo.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.204
Come with Vexie.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.032
Hello.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.300
What took you so long?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.137
And what's wrong
with your face?

31:32.349 --> 31:36.137
You look like a walking
chemical peel gone wrong.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.935
Ohhh. Don't pout.

31:39.148 --> 31:42.891
So boring. Come.

31:57.333 --> 32:01.042
It's true. The doctor
has turned you.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.585
I can hear your heart beating.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.789
You and I we're the same.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.841
Both human. Isn't it wonderful?

32:09.053 --> 32:11.339
Gross.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.261
Alright, well we have to hurry
alright, because when Lauren

32:13.474 --> 32:14.964
finds out that I sent
the text, and not Bo

32:15.184 --> 32:17.425
and Bo isn't downstairs
she gonna come back.

32:17.645 --> 32:18.680
Fine, let's go then.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.932
I'm itchy everywhere
and I think I might be

32:21.148 --> 32:23.434
getting my period
for the first time.

32:23.651 --> 32:27.519
There better be some
miracle cure-all in that bag.

32:30.491 --> 32:33.107
Shitty-ass rosemary.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.198
Some blonde's extension.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.162
Bad barbie rattan furniture?

32:42.378 --> 32:43.788
That's it?

32:48.801 --> 32:51.338
I found something
very powerful

32:51.554 --> 32:53.670
and this is gonna
make everything better.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.265
Trust me.

32:55.474 --> 33:02.061
How can I trust an albatross
so utterly fantastic at failing?

33:02.273 --> 33:04.355
Bring home a
cute University pal.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.852
Fail.

33:06.068 --> 33:09.026
Bring me the head
of the Succubus.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.024
Fail.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.198
Fix my eye.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.618
I still see spots.

33:19.748 --> 33:23.832
Always such a
disappointing monster.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.000
Don't call me that.

33:26.213 --> 33:30.582
I always knew you were
a monster on the inside,

33:30.801 --> 33:33.508
but now you look like a
monster on the outside too.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.461
Stop it, Mother!

33:35.681 --> 33:37.672
Mother?!

33:49.737 --> 33:51.352
Recognize anything?

33:57.786 --> 33:58.616
I was secretly
hoping this thing

33:58.829 --> 34:01.662
I'm not supposed to
find would be easy to spot.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.160
There are too many
of them to fight at once.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.206
Let's spread out.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.535
All I see are horses.

34:09.006 --> 34:11.338
Intruders!

34:19.099 --> 34:22.637
You don't like me very much,
do you horse-whisperer?

34:22.853 --> 34:26.687
If it comes, you will
bring death and destruction.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.356
If what comes?

34:29.568 --> 34:33.402
Do not play games,
betrayer of all.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.697
You are interfering
with destiny.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.525
No, I'm finally facing it.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.506
Oh, does that bother you?

34:58.722 --> 34:59.802
You only like horse-play when

35:00.015 --> 35:02.347
you're the one
doing the playing?

35:02.559 --> 35:04.220
You must die.

35:06.897 --> 35:07.932
'Kay, we found it, now what?

35:08.148 --> 35:08.773
Be careful.

35:08.983 --> 35:10.519
Could be a Trojan horse.

35:10.734 --> 35:11.769
Yeah.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.271
Maybe what we're looking
for is inside the horse.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.853
There must be some kind
of trigger or something.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.828
Wait!

35:25.040 --> 35:28.532
Show thyself, on guard, be
keen. To reunite with me...

35:28.752 --> 35:30.538
The Queen.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.081
No!

35:39.305 --> 35:41.546
The handfasting, cannot be--

35:43.559 --> 35:46.050
Handfasting?

35:46.270 --> 35:47.510
Oh no, no, no.

35:47.730 --> 35:48.594
Been there, done that.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.850
With a Loki in a
cheesy Niagara hotel.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.772
What?

35:52.985 --> 35:56.273
Tell me if I'm
getting this wrong but

35:56.488 --> 35:59.195
are we supposed
to get married?

36:34.485 --> 36:36.271
Kenzi.

36:38.405 --> 36:39.269
I'm glad you're here.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.151
How have you been?

36:41.367 --> 36:45.360
Showing your new
lady knight the sights?

36:45.579 --> 36:47.410
You can try to
push me away Kenzi,

36:47.623 --> 36:49.864
but it's not gonna work.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.699
I love you.

36:54.588 --> 36:59.048
It's really interesting stuff.

36:59.259 --> 37:02.171
One with eyes
both brown and blue.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.004
One who shifts,
a Valkyrie too.

37:05.224 --> 37:08.341
One with blood
that rules the world,

37:08.560 --> 37:12.098
one who sings,
his life unfurled.

37:12.314 --> 37:17.024
A warrior to be her guide,
a healer always by her side.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.522
The professor and Mary-Ann.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.650
Everyone's in here except
the weak human girl.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.029
Kenzi, you are a
part of all of us.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.870
Unclaim me Bo.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.917
That is your grief talking.

37:36.130 --> 37:37.165
That's not what you want.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.667
No I know I don't
want to be here anymore.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.293
My Queen.

37:41.510 --> 37:42.670
Not now.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.626
lt's Rainer.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.257
There's not much time.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.633
Can you just do one thing,

37:47.850 --> 37:50.683
this one thing
that I'm asking you?

37:50.894 --> 37:52.680
No. I'm not letting
you go, I can't.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.011
This is not about you!

37:54.231 --> 37:56.187
Kenzi this is a tough time.

37:59.570 --> 38:04.189
Unclaim me.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.740
Fine.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.870
I unclaim you.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.876
My Queen, please.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.722
Here, give this to Rainer.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.890
I'm sorry. It's
the best I can do.

38:35.481 --> 38:36.561
Kenzi, we are not done.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.434
Yeah. We're done.

38:44.406 --> 38:48.069
Monster? So cruel.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.072
I hate you!

38:51.288 --> 38:52.994
But I love you.

38:53.207 --> 38:54.663
The Valkyrie hair. The seed.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.082
What will make you love me?

38:57.294 --> 39:00.161
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

39:00.380 --> 39:03.543
And you, I will get
her everything she wanted.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.715
I will be
everything she wanted.

39:05.928 --> 39:07.418
And you, you're gonna help me.

39:07.638 --> 39:08.878
I won't.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.678
We are gonna
make a great team.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.427
Of course, you're
gonna have to die,

39:12.643 --> 39:14.008
I will not help a madman.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.513
I am not a monster!

39:15.729 --> 39:19.267
Stop calling me a monster!

39:19.483 --> 39:23.567
When you see what
I'm about to do, it's--

39:23.779 --> 39:24.939
You're a scientist.

39:25.155 --> 39:28.773
You are really,
really gonna dig this.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.331
This is the Origin Seed.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.583
The Seed. No, Massimo.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.131
I will do anything.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.675
Please, please do not eat that.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.502
Whoever takes this seed will

39:50.722 --> 39:52.633
have the combined
power of the Una Mens.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.340
And that means all power.

39:55.561 --> 39:59.179
And it is all mine.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.559
No, no, no, no, no.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.814
Mmmmm.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.358
Please.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.190
(evil laughter)

40:15.956 --> 40:20.541
(screaming)

40:28.552 --> 40:30.838
I came as soon
as I got your note.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.214
Are you all right?

40:32.431 --> 40:35.047
Everything is
changing around me.

40:35.267 --> 40:39.476
I can't stop that,
but I can control this.

40:39.688 --> 40:42.680
So I will bind with
you and save your life

40:42.899 --> 40:45.515
and face my father
on my own terms.

40:45.736 --> 40:47.522
Are you sure
this is what you want?

40:47.738 --> 40:49.023
Just to be clear.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.571
This isn't about love.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.741
This is about what's
right for my family.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.070
Bo, it is our destiny
to fight together

40:58.290 --> 41:00.030
for the good of the Fae.

41:00.250 --> 41:04.118
To unite will be to
join in a mutual quest.

41:04.338 --> 41:06.954
And for the record,
I do love you.

41:11.887 --> 41:13.502
Here we go.

41:16.558 --> 41:26.399
(latin chanting)

41:26.610 --> 41:33.448
(latin chanting)

41:36.828 --> 41:38.238
Is that it?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.366
Well you did just save my life.

41:40.582 --> 41:51.129
(evil laughter)

41:51.343 --> 41:55.427
The... The prophecy
has been written.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.676
She will rise, with
The Wanderer as her soldier,

41:58.892 --> 42:02.760
and together they will
release the Lord of Darkness.

42:02.979 --> 42:06.563
I'm sorry, what
did you just say?

42:08.026 --> 42:11.564
The Dark Lord rises from Hel.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.691
He will be here any minute.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.522
Hell, hell?

42:15.742 --> 42:18.950
No, the mirror of Valhalla.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.369
H-E-L.

42:21.581 --> 42:24.573
You betrayed me, you bitch.

42:24.793 --> 42:27.956
All those years
by my side, a ruse.

42:28.171 --> 42:28.751
You will pay.

42:28.964 --> 42:29.669
No.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.382
He will protect me.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.752
He promised me everything.

42:33.969 --> 42:35.459
Everlasting life.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.510
Power of my own.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.338
He will be here.

42:41.977 --> 42:44.263
The prophecy
said he would come.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.310
So where is he then?

42:48.984 --> 42:52.568
No! No!

42:55.782 --> 43:00.572
Please, please!

43:00.787 --> 43:03.745
(screaming in pain)

43:03.957 --> 43:06.198
It was all for you!

43:14.259 --> 43:16.170
Oh god, Rainer!

43:16.386 --> 43:18.217
What have we done?
