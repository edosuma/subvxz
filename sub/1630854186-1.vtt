Previously onYoung Sheldon...Can we talk?

00:05.309 --> 00:07.137
I'm pregnant.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.791
JEFF:
You've got a lot

00:08.834 --> 00:10.053
going on right now.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.924
Maybe take some time off,

00:11.968 --> 00:13.013
focus on things at home.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.666
Hold on.

00:14.710 --> 00:15.580
Are you firing her?

00:15.624 --> 00:16.799
MEEMAW:
Hey, George.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.061
What's up?

00:18.105 --> 00:19.715
Georgie and I ran
into a little...

00:19.758 --> 00:21.282
problem at the border.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.631
What border?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.502
The Mexican one.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.113
We got arrested.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.114
What?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.941
Who is it?

00:29.725 --> 00:30.856
Arrested?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.162
What do you mean, arrested?

00:32.206 --> 00:34.208
I don't know.
Some problem with Customs.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.427
What were they doing in Mexico?I don't know.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.168
Why didn't they tell
us they were going?

00:38.212 --> 00:39.909
How many times
I got to say I don't know?

00:39.952 --> 00:42.564
[sighs] All right,
what do you know?

00:42.607 --> 00:44.740
Well, they're probably gonna
have to pay some fine,

00:44.783 --> 00:46.089
and-and they're
gonna need cash.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.700
My son is gonna be
in jail overnight?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.093
What about your mother?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.790
Oh, she's been there before.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.662
Meemaw's in jail?Uh...

00:53.705 --> 00:55.316
No.Forget about it.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.840
Forget about it? Do I need to
remind you I remember my birth?

00:57.883 --> 00:59.102
[grunts]

00:59.146 --> 01:00.321
Go to your room.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.758
That was a rough day.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.890
Rough day for me.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.485
[quietly]: You see what I see?

01:34.529 --> 01:35.921
What?

01:35.965 --> 01:38.010
An open window.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.753
You want to make
a run for it?

01:41.797 --> 01:43.059
You got a better plan?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.060
Yes.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.801
You shutting up.

You give me some seltzer,
I can get that

01:52.764 --> 01:53.809
right out.Shh.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.637
Sorry.So,

01:55.680 --> 01:57.465
smuggling cigarettes.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.511
Your Honor, there
was no smuggling.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.645
This is a... misunderstanding.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.430
400 cartons
of undeclared cigarettes?

02:06.474 --> 02:08.128
Is that over the limit?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.521
By 399.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.436
[quietly]: I told
you not to talk.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.090
And he told you not to talk.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.309
All right. [grunts]

02:15.352 --> 02:17.049
Here's youroptions:

02:17.093 --> 02:19.051
plead not guilty, post a bond,

02:19.095 --> 02:20.618
come back here for a trial,

02:20.662 --> 02:22.011
which you will lose,

02:22.054 --> 02:23.273
because you're guilty.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.493
Or?Plead guilty,

02:25.536 --> 02:26.842
pay a fine

02:26.885 --> 02:29.061
and I never see your face again.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.282
But we get the
cigarettes back, right?

02:33.022 --> 02:34.023
No.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.199
How much
is the fine?

02:36.243 --> 02:38.201
Why don't we say $2,500?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.985
Let's say $500.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.639
This is not a negotiation.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.511
I hear ya.

02:43.554 --> 02:44.555
$750.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.556
We're done.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.037
Leon, get these clowns
out of here.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.604
Your Honor, please,

02:49.647 --> 02:51.475
I really need
those cigarettes back.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.173
My girlfriend's
gonna have my baby

02:53.216 --> 02:56.088
and I was gonna sell 'em to help
pay for the medical expenses.

02:56.132 --> 02:59.222
That's a touching story.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.528
Leon!

03:00.571 --> 03:02.051
Sorry.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.792
Too much Mountain Dew.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.098
Take 'em back to holding.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.318
[Meemaw sighs]

03:08.362 --> 03:11.756
How 'bout $1,000 and you
can keep my grandson?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.455
What is happening
to our family?

03:14.498 --> 03:16.500
I know. Georgie
and Meemaw in jail.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.241
Mom getting kicked out
of the church.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.591
Georgie having a baby
out of wedlock.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.333
You know what this
means, don't you?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.378
What?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.858
We really are white trash.

03:26.902 --> 03:27.903
Speak for yourself.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.644
I'm in college on a full ride.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.777
But I wish y'all luck.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.086
I really
appreciate this, Dale.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.306
Smuggling
cigarettes?

03:39.349 --> 03:40.829
What the hell
was she thinking?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.352
It was Georgie's idea.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.093
Well, that makes more sense.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.486
Well,

03:45.529 --> 03:47.749
whose truck we taking?

03:47.792 --> 03:49.054
You're coming?

03:49.098 --> 03:51.666
My ex-girlfriend in jail
at the Mexican border?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.711
[chuckles] I got
to take pictures.

03:53.755 --> 03:54.756
[scoffs]

03:54.799 --> 03:56.018
All right, I'll drive.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.802
But we got to stop and get film.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.634
Who you spying on?

04:03.678 --> 04:05.288
Meemaw's house.
There's a strange woman

04:05.332 --> 04:07.595
loitering on her porch.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.466
Let me see.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.383
SHELDON:
Should we call the police?

04:13.427 --> 04:14.993
MISSY:
Nah, she's too pretty

04:15.037 --> 04:16.299
to be a burglar.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.171
I don't think that's
how that works.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.350
Connie? Are you okay?

04:26.178 --> 04:28.311
All right, I'm coming in.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.400
MISSY:
Freeze, dirtbag.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.228
Who are you?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.316
No, no, we have

04:33.360 --> 04:34.361
the moral high ground here.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.797
Yeah. Who are you?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.321
I'm a friend of the lady
that lives here.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.540
I'm worried about her.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
That's no lady.
That's our meemaw.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.631
Are you Georgie's
brother and sister?

04:43.674 --> 04:45.023
Yeah.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.677
I'm Mandy.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.288
I'm Georgie's...

04:49.289 --> 04:50.333
I'm Mandy.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.421
Oh, really?

04:51.465 --> 04:52.814
Yeah, really.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.598
And I'm worried
about your meemaw.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.297
Well, you don't have to be.
She's fine.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.081
She is?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.561
Yes, Sheldon, she is.

05:00.604 --> 05:01.823
So she's not in jail?

05:01.866 --> 05:03.346
She's in jail?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.566
Well, I thought so,
but maybe not.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.226
So why is Connie in jail?

05:14.270 --> 05:15.576
That's family business.

05:15.619 --> 05:16.925
Although Mandy is
carrying Georgie's baby

05:16.968 --> 05:18.230
and Georgie's
also in jail, so...

05:18.274 --> 05:19.667
Georgie's in jail?!

05:19.710 --> 05:21.277
Why are you
still talking?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.539
That is a valid question.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.801
It's past my bedtime.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.150
Good. Go.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.761
Nice meeting you!

05:28.502 --> 05:30.547
So, what happened?

05:30.591 --> 05:32.462
All I know is they had
a problem at the border.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.595
Something about
smuggling cigarettes.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.945
[quietly]:
What an idiot.Hey.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.339
He was just trying to make money
'cause you got pregnant.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.731
Oh, so this is my fault?

05:40.775 --> 05:43.081
He didn't make that baby
on his own.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.823
Look, you're just a kid, okay?

05:45.867 --> 05:47.390
You don't understand
what's going on here.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.088
I know my mom lost her job
and got kicked out of the church

05:50.132 --> 05:52.439
because you won't marry
my brother.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.180
I didn't know that.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.269
So did I win this argument?

05:57.313 --> 05:58.967
Feels like I did.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.535
Okay, God,

06:01.578 --> 06:02.710
we need to talk.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.581
Are you testing me?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.278
Is this a test?

06:06.322 --> 06:08.455
Am I Mrs. Job?

06:08.498 --> 06:11.196
I try to be a good person,
but...

06:11.240 --> 06:13.590
lately, it feels like
you are smacking me down

06:13.634 --> 06:15.287
every chance you get.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.290
And I know that that might sound
a little ungrateful right now,

06:18.334 --> 06:20.031
as I load my new dishwasher--

06:20.075 --> 06:21.381
that I love--

06:21.424 --> 06:23.861
but can't you pick on
someone else for a while?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.210
SHELDON:
Who are you talking to?

06:25.254 --> 06:26.473
[exhales sharply]

06:27.343 --> 06:29.606
God.To yourself. Got it.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.348
And you think, like Job,
God is testing your faith?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.524
[scoffs]
Sure would explain

06:34.568 --> 06:36.178
all the bad things that
have been happening.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.398
So believing in a god
who's going out of his way

06:38.441 --> 06:39.747
to ruin your life
is more comforting

06:39.790 --> 06:41.749
than believing
there's no God at all?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.752
Isn't it past your bedtime?

06:44.795 --> 06:46.536
I know. Good night.[stammers]W-Wait.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.798
Where's your sister?

06:47.842 --> 06:49.452
At Meemaw's,
talking to Mandy.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.236
What? Why?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.542
Can we table this for tomorrow?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.544
I'm running on fumes.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.810
DALE: So instead of traveling
around the country with me,

06:59.854 --> 07:03.074
she'd rather smuggle
cigarettes and rot in jail.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.381
How the hell is that
supposed to make me feel?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.469
I don't know.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.470
Bad?

07:07.514 --> 07:08.906
Damn right, bad.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.039
Treated that woman
like a queen.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.649
Didn't you break up with her?

07:12.693 --> 07:14.782
[huffs]
That was a bluff.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.653
Never thought she'd call it.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.655
Well, you are coming
to her rescue.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.309
Maybe this'll turn
things around.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.615
Who says I want her back?

07:21.658 --> 07:23.573
Great, you don't want her back.
Let's drop it.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.054
I will say one thing.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.404
I miss the sex.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.536
Oh, God.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.059
She is vivacious.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.757
And not just for a woman
her age.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.846
Oh, look, a hitchhiker.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.805
Let's pick him up.
Maybe he'll kill me.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.676
Do you hate Georgie?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.723
No. No, Georgie's
a good guy.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.814
If anything, I hate myself
for making bad decisions.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.511
Like having sex
before marriage?

07:48.555 --> 07:51.166
More like having
tequila before sex.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.559
MARY:
Hey.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.082
What's going on here?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.258
Mandy was just telling me
how she got pregnant.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.434
No, no...But you said...

07:58.478 --> 08:00.741
No.
No.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.439
Uh, are Georgie
and Connie okay?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.049
[exhales]

08:05.093 --> 08:06.442
Um, I hope so.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.750
My husband just went down there
to get 'em out.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.056
Okay. That's good.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.582
Okay, I guess
I'll get going.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.282
It... was nice seeing ya.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.591
I'm sorry about your troubles
with the church.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.376
What did you tell her?

08:27.419 --> 08:28.899
Just the highlights.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.162
Oh! I forgot I punched out
a kid in Sunday school.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.903
You don't have to
tell her all that.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.036
Maybe she'll feel guilty
and marry Georgie.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.806
Hi there, Missy.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.590
[sighs]
May I help you?

18:33.634 --> 18:36.854
Um, I was hoping to talk
to your mom. She around?

18:36.898 --> 18:39.683
I'm not sure.
Let me see if she's available.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.208
What's going on?

18:42.251 --> 18:43.687
She's available.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.386
[sighs softly]
Hello.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.563
Mary, I am so
sorry about today.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.869
I understand
why you're upset.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.698
But the church is
still your family.

18:54.742 --> 18:58.833
I'd just... hate to see you
walk away from the Lord.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.837
[inhales sharply, sighs]

19:02.880 --> 19:05.883
Feels like he's
walking away from me.
