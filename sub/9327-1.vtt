WEBVTT

01:20.784 --> 01:22.217
Breakfast.

01:24.021 --> 01:25.454
I'm going.

01:26.857 --> 01:28.791
I thought I'd say goodbye.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.335
Gentlemen, again, all the best.
Take good care.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.841
Good luck and goodbye.

01:47.311 --> 01:49.245
It's been fun.

02:05.428 --> 02:07.362
Here you go, sir.

02:09.431 --> 02:11.366
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:40.563 --> 02:43.497
"GUARDING TESS'"

04:36.376 --> 04:38.571
I'm here to see
the director of the Secret Service.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.168
Okay. Thanks.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.546
Is there anyplace
where I could put my bags?

04:43.616 --> 04:45.016
Over there.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.019
- Thank you.
- Okay.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.982
Congratulations, Doug. You've done
a terrific job on a tough detail.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.857
Well, thank you, sir.
It wasn't that tough, actually.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.296
Summersville, Ohio, is not exactly
the center of the universe...

04:59.365 --> 05:01.834
of course. But it's
a nice, quiet little place.

05:01.901 --> 05:06.201
Guarding Mrs. Carlisle gave me time to
pick up many hours towards my Master's.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.105
- Oh, great.
- Of course, now I am hoping...

05:09.175 --> 05:13.305
for a little more active assignment,
maybe back in the White House...

05:13.378 --> 05:15.472
or a criminal assignment
out of New York or L.A.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.709
Sure.
Let's sit over here.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.047
Yes. Sir.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.552
Joan?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.423
- Yes?
- Coffee.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.289
- Certainly. It'll be just a moment.
- Thanks.

05:32.564 --> 05:34.999
How is she?
What's she like?

05:35.067 --> 05:40.164
Well, there's the public person who's,
you know, adored.

05:40.239 --> 05:43.174
Then there's the private person
who can, at times...

05:43.242 --> 05:46.734
be difficult to deal with if you
don't know how to handle the situation.

05:46.811 --> 05:50.406
- And you did.
- Well, I guess, as well as anybody.

05:50.482 --> 05:53.610
I don't envy my replacement,
I'll tell you that.

05:53.685 --> 05:57.781
I was in her husband's White House,
and I saw her in better times.

05:57.856 --> 06:00.257
She has her good days
and her bad days now.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.555
I guess you could say...

06:02.627 --> 06:06.427
she's several different personalities
in one, like many people.

06:08.166 --> 06:12.068
Well, one of her personalities
called the White House last night...

06:12.137 --> 06:16.072
and ask ed the president to arrange
that you stay with her for another tour.

06:19.778 --> 06:21.211
The president?

06:28.653 --> 06:32.452
I can't go back there.
I can't do three more years there.

06:32.523 --> 06:36.324
I can't do three more minutes there.
It's... It... l...

06:36.394 --> 06:38.725
I mean, it's...

06:38.796 --> 06:42.630
the worst assignment there is
in the service.

06:42.700 --> 06:46.398
Well then, we've got a problem
because the president...

06:46.471 --> 06:50.601
is asking you to return to Mrs. Carlisle
as a personal favor to him.

06:50.674 --> 06:53.074
What if I say no?

06:55.379 --> 06:59.315
I'll call him and tell him,
uh, you said no.

07:00.851 --> 07:04.252
Take a moment to think it over.
I'II check on the coffee.

07:12.896 --> 07:13.129
In New Jersey, ice kept three dolphins
trapped in an inland waterway...

07:13.129 --> 07:16.566
In New Jersey, ice kept three dolphins
trapped in an inland waterway...

07:16.634 --> 07:19.568
Wednesday, frustrating rescuers'
efforts to free the animals...

07:19.637 --> 07:22.128
Where's the Columbus paper?
Who's got it?

07:22.205 --> 07:24.139
Just checking my horoscope.

07:24.207 --> 07:28.143
Frederick, I told you 1,000 times, she
can tell if we've read it before her.

07:28.211 --> 07:29.645
Sorry.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.575
- Morning, Doug.
- Morning.

07:35.652 --> 07:39.213
- What are you doing here?
- Long story.

07:39.288 --> 07:42.155
- Everything okay in Washington, Doug?
- Yeah.

07:42.225 --> 07:44.887
Just back to pick up
your accoutrement?

07:44.961 --> 07:46.826
Speak English.

07:46.897 --> 07:49.091
Back to pick up your shit?

07:49.165 --> 07:50.860
No smoking, Earl.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.197
Why not?
She never comes down here.

07:53.269 --> 07:54.759
It's a rule.

07:56.773 --> 08:00.003
- I am shock ed to see you back here.
- Are ya?

08:00.076 --> 08:03.307
Ja. I thought you'd be guarding
Jackie O. By now...

08:03.379 --> 08:07.611
standing outside the Russian Tea Room
for hour after hour in the snow...

08:07.684 --> 08:13.054
with her inside, having little cakes and
chatting to her fashionable friends.

08:13.122 --> 08:14.554
Here, Frederick.

08:14.623 --> 08:17.491
- I'II do it this morning, Fred.
- Thank you.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.207
Good morning.

08:42.183 --> 08:43.616
Breakfast!

08:47.756 --> 08:49.189
Come in.

09:27.729 --> 09:29.161
Douglas, darling.

09:30.531 --> 09:32.021
Yes, ma'am?

09:32.100 --> 09:35.034
You seem to have dropped
some of my things on the floor.

09:35.103 --> 09:37.434
Would you kindly
pick them up for me?

09:38.773 --> 09:40.206
Yes, ma'am.

09:43.344 --> 09:45.244
That's a good boy.

09:52.486 --> 09:56.616
Do I still have any influence in that
evil town, or have they forgotten me?

09:56.690 --> 10:00.717
Ma'am, with all due respect,
why me?

10:00.795 --> 10:05.232
Why, because I like you, Douglas.
And my feelings are a bit hurt...

10:05.299 --> 10:08.234
that anyone would be that anxious
to get away from me.

10:08.302 --> 10:12.170
Well, I certainly don't mean
to hurt your feelings, Mrs. Carlisle...

10:12.239 --> 10:16.470
but my assignment her e is finished,
and I'd like to get back to Washington.

10:16.543 --> 10:19.740
Washington is a dead-end town,
career-wise...

10:19.813 --> 10:23.408
unless you're there purely to make
money, which I'm sure you wouldn't be.

10:23.483 --> 10:25.383
I'd like to go back.

10:25.451 --> 10:29.945
- Well, I'm sorry, but I need you her e.
- Mrs. Carlisle?

10:30.023 --> 10:32.321
Yes?

10:32.392 --> 10:35.452
I'd just like you to know
that I came back of my own free will.

10:35.528 --> 10:39.692
As an S.A. I. C... I could have refused
this assignment. But I didn't.

10:39.766 --> 10:41.699
S.A. I.C.? What is that?

10:41.768 --> 10:44.168
Ma'am, you know what that is.

10:44.236 --> 10:46.467
No, I really don't.

10:46.539 --> 10:47.938
You do.

10:48.007 --> 10:51.499
Don't tell me what I do and don't know.
That is not your place.

10:53.145 --> 10:55.842
What is a "said"?

10:56.916 --> 11:00.477
S.A. I.C. Stands for
"special agent in charge."

11:02.355 --> 11:08.225
Oh, I see. A special agent, are we?
And in charge, no less.

11:08.294 --> 11:10.227
My, my, my.

11:10.296 --> 11:14.698
You rarely meet someone who's
a secret agent who's also in charge.

11:14.766 --> 11:17.031
And why is he in charge?

11:17.103 --> 11:20.970
Well. Because he's
so doggone special.

11:21.039 --> 11:23.599
And you did not come back
of your own free will.

11:23.675 --> 11:27.338
If you had a free will,
you'd be miles from here.

11:27.412 --> 11:30.506
I have some very exciting
news for you.

11:30.582 --> 11:33.915
I have an inoperable
brain tumor.

11:35.954 --> 11:39.185
I have bought you and your men
a SCU D missile launcher.

11:40.826 --> 11:45.319
We are going to the opera in Columbus.
Which of those do you think is true?

11:45.397 --> 11:47.331
When?

11:48.400 --> 11:52.426
I would like to drive to Columbus
a week from Friday.

11:53.338 --> 11:57.240
Yes, ma'am. May I say,
it is good to see you getting out again?

11:57.308 --> 12:00.277
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.745
Thank you, Douglas.
That's very patronizing of you.

12:05.216 --> 12:07.549
I suppose you couldn't
care less about opera.

12:09.621 --> 12:12.054
- No, ma'am, I couldn't.
- Of course not.

12:12.123 --> 12:15.024
You're a typical,
r ed-blooded American male.

12:15.092 --> 12:20.394
You'd probably rather watch the reruns
of "Mr. Ed" on television, wouldn't you?

12:20.464 --> 12:22.762
Tell me.

12:22.833 --> 12:26.633
If you had to choose
between opera and "Mr. Ed"...

12:27.705 --> 12:32.199
I'd choose "Mr. Ed"
in a second.

12:32.276 --> 12:34.539
Always so honest.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.307
I try.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.405
Good for you, Agent Dougie.

12:38.482 --> 12:42.077
Now put my rosebud on the tray
and get out.

12:42.153 --> 12:45.087
As you can see,
I'm extremely busy.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.122
Yes, ma'am.

13:00.204 --> 13:04.038
I expect him any minute.
I'll tell him as soon as he comes in.

13:04.108 --> 13:06.132
All right.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.642
Goodbye.

13:12.216 --> 13:17.244
- She wants to see you.
- Oh, come on. I was just up there!

13:17.320 --> 13:21.279
She called the president to demand I
pull another tour. How about that shit?

13:21.358 --> 13:24.327
- Why?
- Because she likes me.

13:24.394 --> 13:28.524
- Oh, you don't think that's the reason?
- I don't know. Who knows with her?

13:28.598 --> 13:33.001
- She didn't say she likes me, did she?
- It has nothing to do with like.

13:33.069 --> 13:36.470
She doesn't want a new guy
comin' in here, shakin' things up...

13:36.539 --> 13:38.473
tryin ' to get things running right.

13:38.541 --> 13:41.635
She's got me broken in.
She'll never let me go.

13:42.645 --> 13:44.670
Now my master calls again.

13:44.747 --> 13:47.717
- Doug, come here. Check this out.
- Helen Grace. Helen?

13:47.783 --> 13:51.550
Yes, Peter. In the city of Agua Dulce,
automatic weapon fire broke out...

13:51.621 --> 13:53.781
shortly after 2:30 local time.

13:53.856 --> 13:57.622
The president was taken from the scene.
Secret Service plainclothesmen...

13:57.693 --> 14:00.526
You see those Special Tactics guys?
They're everywhere.

14:00.596 --> 14:04.054
The crowd had only seconds ago applauded
the American leader repeatedly.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.067
- The men with the guns and rifles.
- Yes, Mrs. Carlisle?

14:06.135 --> 14:09.003
- Are they U.S. Secret Service agents?
- Doug, she says it's urgent.

14:09.071 --> 14:11.699
Tell her I'II be there
in 15 minutes.

14:11.774 --> 14:15.232
He says he'll be there in 15 minutes.
Mrs. Carlisle?

14:15.310 --> 14:16.709
Go up.

14:16.779 --> 14:20.374
What does she want? Chocolate?
Some kind of goddamn fruit drink?

14:20.448 --> 14:23.350
Do we look like a bunch of waiters?
We wanna be down there!

14:23.419 --> 14:25.220
...some sort of charity work.
I have no idea...

14:25.220 --> 14:26.687
...some sort of charity work.
I have no idea...

14:26.755 --> 14:29.315
I got it!

14:29.391 --> 14:33.157
- I'm coming!
- I can't do three more years of this.

14:48.410 --> 14:51.867
I told you never to bring a gun
in this room. Now get it out.

14:51.947 --> 14:53.914
Yes, ma'am.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.685
How dare you
bring a gun in here?

15:05.126 --> 15:07.254
- Sorry, Mrs. Carlisle.
- That's all right.

15:07.328 --> 15:10.456
- That emergency alarm is to be used...
- It belongs to me.

15:10.531 --> 15:13.329
I'll use it
anytime I want.

15:13.401 --> 15:16.598
I think it bothers the neighbors.
Sorry.

15:16.671 --> 15:18.366
What is it?

15:18.439 --> 15:20.737
I want to play golf.

15:22.210 --> 15:23.643
What?

15:23.711 --> 15:27.545
Golf. It's a game.
My husband and I used to play it.

15:27.615 --> 15:31.050
- Do you remember that?
- Mrs. Carlisle, it's 38 degrees.

15:31.119 --> 15:34.088
Thank you, Tom. Could you have
the car ready in half in hour?

15:34.154 --> 15:37.419
- Yes. Ma'am.
- Thank you.

15:37.491 --> 15:39.891
Now go on. Shoo.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.394
Go on.

15:43.130 --> 15:44.564
Kimberly?

15:45.633 --> 15:47.225
Kimberly!

16:08.088 --> 16:10.522
Would you mind
not standing there?

16:12.025 --> 16:15.755
No, not there. Go over there
where I can see where you are.

16:15.828 --> 16:19.287
- Didn't you guard Ford or Agnew?
- No, ma'am.

16:19.365 --> 16:23.598
All they ever did was play golf,
which was a blessing for the country.

16:23.670 --> 16:27.697
Yes, ma'am.
No, I was too young.

16:27.774 --> 16:31.608
- What?
- Too young to serve Ford or Agnew.

16:31.678 --> 16:34.511
Get back in the cart.
Get in the cart!

16:34.580 --> 16:36.879
Yes, ma'am.

17:08.981 --> 17:11.415
What is this all about?

17:11.483 --> 17:14.781
She sits up in her room for five years,
and now we've got golf.

17:14.853 --> 17:16.286
And opera.

17:18.256 --> 17:21.281
- What's next?
- Synchronized swimming.

17:22.361 --> 17:25.089
Why are you making noise?
We're trying to putt.

17:25.163 --> 17:26.153
Sorry.

17:27.499 --> 17:32.526
Why don 't you make yourselves useful?
One of you, come and hold the pin.

17:32.604 --> 17:34.038
Yes, ma'am.

17:38.810 --> 17:40.243
Putt!

17:58.763 --> 18:02.699
Would you be kind enough
to get my first ball, please, Doug?

18:06.937 --> 18:10.931
I'm a Secret Service agent,
Mrs. Carlisle, not a caddy.

18:11.009 --> 18:14.206
You want that ball?
I suggest you go get it yourself.

18:15.479 --> 18:17.140
- Ralph?
- Yo!

18:17.214 --> 18:19.149
Since you've insisted
on me staying...

18:19.216 --> 18:22.744
you should know I intend
to do my job by the book...

18:22.820 --> 18:26.311
which means we don't run errands,
we don't make snacks...

18:26.390 --> 18:29.554
and we don't check our guns
at the door.

18:29.627 --> 18:31.856
Now, if you don't like
any of this...

18:31.928 --> 18:35.056
I suggest you call Washington
and get yourself a new man.

18:36.534 --> 18:39.593
I'd be very careful
if I were you, Agent.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.604
You 're way out of your depth.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.106
Let's switch.

18:44.174 --> 18:47.109
- I've got to go up to the clubhouse.
- Sure thing, Doug.

19:01.425 --> 19:01.558
I told her...

19:01.558 --> 19:04.355
I told her...

19:04.428 --> 19:08.489
"No more calling us 'gofers with guns,'
snacks in the middle of the night...

19:08.565 --> 19:11.398
no more checking our weapons
outside your bedroom door."

19:11.468 --> 19:13.595
You said that?

19:13.670 --> 19:17.730
In so many words, I said,
from now on, we go by the book.

19:17.807 --> 19:20.971
- And she stood for this?
- She didn't say a thing.

19:21.044 --> 19:24.501
Oh, yeah. She tells me
to go find her ball.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.141
I said, "I'm not a caddy.
I'm a Secret Service agent.

19:27.217 --> 19:29.616
- You want that ball, find it yourself."
- Come on.

19:29.686 --> 19:32.119
- Are you crazy?
- No. Here's why...

19:32.188 --> 19:33.621
Doug, telephone.

19:40.696 --> 19:43.062
- Hello?
- Mr. Chesnic?

19:43.132 --> 19:45.828
- Yes.
- Please hold for the president.

19:47.636 --> 19:50.298
- Hello?
- Uh, hello!

19:50.373 --> 19:52.705
- That you, Doug?
- Yes, sir.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.835
- How are ya?
- I'm fine. And you?

19:55.911 --> 19:59.210
Well, I got this call
from Tess Carlisle.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.715
And I know this sounds
a little crazy...

20:01.784 --> 20:05.720
but did you tear up
some flowers of hers?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.484
- Doug? You there?
- Yes, sir.

20:08.557 --> 20:12.584
- Somethin ' about a bunch of roses.
- Well, uh, no.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.926
- It wasn't a bunch. Sir.
- Uh-huh.

20:15.998 --> 20:19.160
- Well, how many of them were there?
- Just one, sir.

20:19.234 --> 20:22.762
I see.
And you tore it up, did ya?

20:22.837 --> 20:25.636
- No, sir. I didn't tear it up.
- Well, what 'd you do?

20:25.707 --> 20:29.336
- I merely removed the bud.
- From her flower?

20:29.411 --> 20:31.345
Yes. Sir.

20:31.413 --> 20:34.507
Okay. Well, let's get
past that for a second.

20:34.582 --> 20:37.312
- I was her husband's vice president.
- Yes, sir.

20:37.385 --> 20:40.946
Frankly, I owe a lot to the Carlisle’s.
She seconded my nomination.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.990
- You know that too.
- Yes, sir.

20:43.057 --> 20:47.187
Why don 't we try to get along better
in Ohio? What do you say?

20:47.262 --> 20:49.457
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.
- I don 't get it.

20:49.531 --> 20:52.591
One day she calls me,
says she can 't live without you.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.602
Next day, she’s callin ',
almost in tears.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.571
So maybe you two have some kind
of sicko thing goin ' on...

20:58.639 --> 21:01.575
- No! No, sir. I can tell you...
- I'll tell you this, Doug.

21:01.642 --> 21:05.977
Any more phone calls from her, you 're
gonna be guardin' my dog. Understand?

21:06.047 --> 21:07.981
- Yes, sir.
- 'Cause I probably got...

21:08.049 --> 21:11.575
the most important job in the world,
and I feel like a goddamn idiot...

21:11.652 --> 21:14.143
havin' to call you
about a goddamn flower I

21:14.222 --> 21:16.917
- You know what I mean?
- I certainly do.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.924
Are you gonna help me out
on this one?

21:18.992 --> 21:22.258
- You can count on it, sir.
- Thanks. That 's what I wanted to hear.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.627
- Have a nice evening, son.
- Yes, sir.

21:24.698 --> 21:26.131
'Night.

21:28.268 --> 21:31.499
If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

22:12.379 --> 22:15.609
Hey, Mrs. Carlisle,
I got your laundry and a Whopper.

22:15.681 --> 22:17.876
Who's this opera by again?

22:17.950 --> 22:19.781
Mozart.

22:19.852 --> 22:22.117
Oh, that's right.

22:22.189 --> 22:25.919
I saw a movie about him.
The guy was a complete jerk.

22:25.992 --> 22:29.291
The end of the movie, some guy comes
to see him in a party mask.

22:29.362 --> 22:32.354
It was just a mask, right?
But it upsets Mozart so much...

22:32.431 --> 22:34.922
that he drops over dead,
just like that.

22:35.001 --> 22:38.562
- What the hell kinda guy is that?
- I don't know, Lee.

22:38.638 --> 22:41.004
Here. Don't shoot yourself.

22:41.073 --> 22:42.506
Very funny.

22:44.843 --> 22:46.436
Happy huntin'.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.208
Well?

23:19.811 --> 23:21.244
Sorry, ma'am.

23:22.781 --> 23:24.942
This way, ma'am.

23:48.106 --> 23:50.040
Kill the engine.

23:53.678 --> 23:55.611
Start the engine.

23:58.682 --> 24:00.776
- Earl.
- Yes. Ma'am?

24:00.852 --> 24:04.309
- Do you like your job?
- Yes, ma'am. A lot.

24:04.389 --> 24:08.119
Ma'am, the protectee is never allowed
to sit directly behind the driver.

24:08.192 --> 24:12.288
That's a regulation. Nobody does it.
Not the president, not anybody.

24:12.363 --> 24:16.390
The sun will be on that side,
and I do not want the sun.

24:16.467 --> 24:20.699
Perhaps you could sit on the proper side
but slightly then to the middle.

24:22.306 --> 24:25.207
- Nope.
- Ma'am, excuse me...

24:25.275 --> 24:28.210
but we are not leaving this house
until you are seated properly...

24:28.278 --> 24:30.677
with your seat belt
firmly fastened.

24:59.443 --> 25:02.434
Jesus Christ. Let her sit
on the hood if she wants to.

25:12.088 --> 25:14.022
Move it out, Earl.

25:15.892 --> 25:17.189
We're rolling.

25:19.095 --> 25:22.531
Oh, these family outings
are always so stressful.

27:27.221 --> 27:29.120
Look.

28:52.037 --> 28:56.167
I have never been so embarrassed
in my life. I want to go home.

28:56.241 --> 28:59.938
I don't want to go to the hotel, and
I will never return to Columbus again.

29:01.613 --> 29:03.672
Yes, ma'am.

29:03.748 --> 29:06.183
For what it's worth,
I was just trying to help.

29:06.251 --> 29:10.915
Your help is most precisely what I do
not want. When will you people get that?

29:18.864 --> 29:20.888
Hello. Oh.

29:23.335 --> 29:26.270
- Please, no autographs now.
- It's good to see you.

29:26.338 --> 29:28.396
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:30.342 --> 29:32.640
Mrs. Carlisle.

29:41.852 --> 29:45.310
- You got my vote!
- I appreciate that. Thank you so much.

29:45.389 --> 29:47.482
Thanks for coming, Tess.

29:47.558 --> 29:51.119
What is this?
I just wanted her autograph.

29:51.195 --> 29:54.687
I'll do you one better. Write me,
and I'll get you an autographed picture.

29:54.765 --> 29:58.496
- Good night, ma'am.
- Oh, a picture. How wonderful.

29:58.569 --> 30:03.131
Well, thank you so very much.
Very nice and wonderful.

30:03.207 --> 30:06.073
I hope you enjoyed the opera
as much as I did.

30:06.143 --> 30:09.670
Thank you. I've changed my mind.
We'll be staying in Columbus tonight.

30:09.747 --> 30:11.806
- Yes, ma'am.
- Give 'em hell, Tess.

30:12.983 --> 30:15.418
What do you care
where she sits?

30:15.486 --> 30:19.980
She's supposed to be where the driver
and I can both see her at the same time.

30:20.056 --> 30:24.050
I know that. That's not what I'm asking.
This detail's a cupcake.

30:24.128 --> 30:28.224
It may be the most boring detail in
the service, but it's still a cupcake.

30:28.299 --> 30:30.926
Why are you gonna risk your career
on crap like that?

30:31.001 --> 30:33.799
Because it's not crap.
It's my job.

30:33.870 --> 30:37.307
I'm either gonna do it right, take pride
in it, or find something else to do.

30:37.374 --> 30:39.774
You're right.
I can't argue.

30:39.843 --> 30:42.539
But Doug,
I wouldn't piss her off.

30:42.612 --> 30:46.673
- More calls to the White House, and...
- I'll be guarding the president's dog.

30:46.750 --> 30:51.187
Bullshit. You'll be gone.
You try to get a job out there now.

30:51.254 --> 30:56.556
Know what they want in private security?
Guys that can bench-press 9,000 pounds.

30:57.961 --> 31:00.896
This is a good deal.
You've let it get personal.

31:05.902 --> 31:07.836
It's not personal.

31:07.904 --> 31:11.236
Of course it is. She doesn't even know
the rest of us are alive.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.608
- How is she?
- She's fine.

31:22.684 --> 31:24.117
But, uh...

31:28.123 --> 31:30.990
- Get rid of those.
- Okay.

31:45.207 --> 31:48.004
What about, uh, Ali-Tyson?

31:48.077 --> 31:51.137
Ali, TKO, eighth round,
in his prime.

31:51.213 --> 31:54.080
All right. What about
Mrs. Carlisle and Nancy Reagan?

31:54.149 --> 31:56.082
- In their prime?
- Yeah.

31:56.151 --> 31:58.914
Mrs. Carlisle would knock Nancy out
in the sixth to seventh round.

31:58.986 --> 32:03.151
- It wouldn't go the distance?
- No. Two completely different fighters.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.283
Nancy doesn't have
the big-time punch.

32:05.359 --> 32:08.260
She throws these cutting left jabs
and combinations.

32:08.330 --> 32:12.232
Always in your face. Unrelenting.
Bap, bap, bap!

32:12.301 --> 32:16.634
Mrs. Carlisle, she's a floater,
a dancer. Totally unpredictable.

32:16.704 --> 32:19.799
Just when you think you got her
where you want her, bam!

32:19.875 --> 32:23.310
Out of nowhere comes her right h and, and
Nancy's on Queer Street. End of fight.

32:23.377 --> 32:25.311
- I think you're right about that.
- I know I'm right.

32:25.379 --> 32:27.780
I know. That's why I ask ed you.

32:27.849 --> 32:32.309
Ralph, be a dear and get me
a Baby Ruth, would you, please?

32:32.386 --> 32:33.648
- Yes.
- Thanks.

32:38.559 --> 32:40.151
Earl, go.

32:40.227 --> 32:41.991
I can't.

32:42.063 --> 32:45.123
Who got you this job?
Did they, or did I?

32:46.901 --> 32:48.060
Yes!

32:54.108 --> 32:56.041
Doug, she took off!

33:07.754 --> 33:09.188
Earl!

33:11.324 --> 33:14.317
I want you to pull over right now.
You hear me, goddamn it?

33:19.065 --> 33:22.728
- I'm sorry, Dou g.
- It's not your fault. It's mine.

33:22.802 --> 33:24.770
Should've seen it coming.

33:37.117 --> 33:39.108
Uh-huh.
Hold on a minute.

33:39.185 --> 33:43.247
I'm gonna... Agent Chesnic,
I'm gonna put you on the speaker.

33:43.323 --> 33:45.119
Is there someone else
in the room?

33:45.191 --> 33:51.460
No. I just want to practice my putting
while we're talking. What can I do?

33:51.531 --> 33:55.762
Would you please put out an all-points
for Mrs. Carlisle’s automobile?

33:55.834 --> 33:59.293
It's a "92 Lincoln, Ohio plates...

33:59.371 --> 34:02.272
Kilo-Hotel-Oscar 362.

34:02.342 --> 34:07.075
When last seen, it was heading east
on the Chester Exit of l-71.

34:07.147 --> 34:11.775
Just hold everything.
Have I got this right?

34:11.850 --> 34:17.219
Have you Secret Service boys gone
and lost the president's wife again?

34:17.289 --> 34:20.656
I don't believe there's any cause
for concern here. She's with her driver.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.321
She's perfectly safe,
but proper procedure requires us...

34:24.396 --> 34:27.331
to notify you.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.456
Of course it does.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.969
- Uh, we'll get on this right now.
- Thank you.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.871
Agent Chesnic, uh...

34:35.940 --> 34:38.875
Ms. Carlisle is pretty slippery,
isn't she?

34:40.012 --> 34:42.445
I mean, for a senior citizen.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.877
Hello?

35:24.055 --> 35:27.354
Doug, let's have
a little stroll around the yard...

35:27.425 --> 35:30.360
before we go in there
and talk to him, okay?

35:37.368 --> 35:41.896
I want you to go in there
and tell Earl to meet me in the office.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.031
Okay, Lee?

35:44.107 --> 35:46.507
- All right.
- Thank you.

35:46.576 --> 35:46.711
Hey, everybody's mad at me, right?

35:46.711 --> 35:49.737
Hey, everybody's mad at me, right?

35:49.814 --> 35:54.911
What am I supposed to do?
I'm just a driver, you know? Hey!

35:59.756 --> 36:02.089
- You're through! You know that?
- No, I don't.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.423
- You don't know that?
- No, I don't.

36:04.494 --> 36:07.122
- Why don't you know that, you tick?
- Buddy, come on.

36:07.197 --> 36:10.325
Because she assured me
that I was not gonna be fired.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.665
In fact, I would have been fired
if I hadn't done it.

36:13.737 --> 36:15.796
Look, look.

36:15.872 --> 36:19.637
You guys come and go,
but I live here...

36:19.709 --> 36:22.906
and I keep my job
because of her.

36:22.979 --> 36:27.040
Oh, you think I don't try
to talk her out of these crazy things.

36:27.117 --> 36:30.143
But I got no choice.

36:30.220 --> 36:32.278
Well, you're fired, Earl.
Trust me.

36:41.530 --> 36:42.964
Come in.

36:47.771 --> 36:52.707
- Did you en joy yourself today?
- Don 't take that tone with me, Douglas.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.677
Look, this is
just stupid, okay?

36:55.745 --> 36:58.179
Which part?

36:58.247 --> 37:02.843
The part where I have to run away like
a fugitive to get one hour of privacy...

37:02.918 --> 37:05.819
or the part where I am
spoken to like a child?

37:05.888 --> 37:09.915
I fir ed Earl.
This has happened twice now.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.561
He is a driver in the employ
of the Secret Service.

37:15.631 --> 37:18.464
I can't do anything about the cook
or the nurse. They work for you.

37:18.534 --> 37:21.058
He works for us.
He's gone!

37:21.136 --> 37:24.106
He works for you
because I told you to hire him.

37:24.173 --> 37:26.937
He's my chauffeur,
and he's staying!

37:35.551 --> 37:40.249
You've got to let me leave this detail,
ma'am. I can't do my job effectively.

37:40.321 --> 37:44.758
Whatever you like.
You can go anytime you please.

37:46.694 --> 37:48.127
Thank you.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.457
You're welcome.

37:53.802 --> 37:55.736
Goodbye, Mrs. Carlisle.

37:55.804 --> 37:57.396
Goodbye.

38:12.253 --> 38:16.417
If I promise
never to run away again...

38:16.491 --> 38:18.583
will that do?

38:18.660 --> 38:21.959
Ma'am, I am truly sorry,
but l...

38:22.030 --> 38:25.465
For God's sake, Doug,
I only went for a little drive.

38:25.532 --> 38:27.830
- It was crazy.
- Yes.

38:27.901 --> 38:31.803
Crazy. Exactly.
You should try it sometime, Douglas.

38:31.873 --> 38:34.706
You should try going crazy yourself.
You should get a date...

38:34.776 --> 38:38.143
have a martini,
drive with the top down.

38:38.212 --> 38:41.181
You should, better yet,
give a tired old widow a break.

38:44.117 --> 38:47.519
I am very sorry, Mrs. Carlisle,
but the regulations...

38:47.589 --> 38:49.954
Oh, well, fine. Go.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.992
Whatever you want to do.
Just leave.

38:53.060 --> 38:57.292
One less gunman lounging around my
house. Take the whole bunch with you.

38:57.364 --> 39:01.494
We are not gunmen, Mrs. Carlisle.

39:01.568 --> 39:05.970
Since I am leaving for sure this time,
I'd like to take this opportunity...

39:06.039 --> 39:09.907
to remind you that you can refuse
Secret Service protection...

39:09.977 --> 39:12.342
anytime you want.

39:12.411 --> 39:14.846
I believe you already know that.

39:14.915 --> 39:16.940
Well, that's brilliant, Doug.

39:17.017 --> 39:19.541
Do you think they'd really
let me get away with that?

39:19.619 --> 39:23.783
I don't know why not. Other people
have done it. But I think you like it.

39:23.856 --> 39:27.087
I think you like having seven men...
and no women agents...

39:27.159 --> 39:29.787
I notice... at your beck and call,
day and night.

39:29.862 --> 39:33.390
- "Get a date."
- How dare you?

39:33.467 --> 39:35.696
- Goodbye, Mrs. Carlisle.
- Get out!

39:35.768 --> 39:40.364
Get out of my house this instant.
And stay out!

40:17.475 --> 40:18.909
Yeah?

40:18.978 --> 40:22.037
This is Air Force One calling.
Stand by for the president.

40:24.115 --> 40:25.548
- Doug?
- Sir?

40:25.618 --> 40:28.313
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

40:28.386 --> 40:33.414
Not too good. I'm on my way to London.
I should be workin' on a speech.

40:33.491 --> 40:36.016
Instead, I'm havin '
a goddamn Tess Carlisle problem I

40:36.094 --> 40:39.359
- What the hell 's that about, Doug?
- L... It's...

40:39.432 --> 40:43.128
Do you know that, as of this morning,
she 's refused Secret Service protection?

40:43.201 --> 40:46.034
- Where the hell’s she get that idea?
- L...

40:46.104 --> 40:49.904
This woman is a national treasure.
You and I know what a pain she is.

40:49.974 --> 40:53.877
But we don't count. It's what the damn
voters think. That's what counts.

40:53.945 --> 40:56.538
And they want this woman looked after.
You understand me?

40:56.614 --> 40:58.048
Yes. Sir.

40:58.116 --> 41:01.107
What if some lunatic cuts her throat?
What about that?

41:01.186 --> 41:04.121
- I agree, sir...
- How much doo-doo would I catch...

41:04.189 --> 41:06.123
if something like that happened
on my watch?

41:06.191 --> 41:08.818
- Yes, sir.
- Let me make it real clear.

41:08.892 --> 41:12.124
Get over to her house
and straighten this out.

41:12.197 --> 41:14.791
I'm countin ' on you,
and so 's the country.

41:14.865 --> 41:18.131
- Yes, sir. I'll get on it right away.
- That's what I wanted to hear.

41:18.203 --> 41:19.635
Thanks.

41:19.703 --> 41:23.833
The next time you're in town,
have dinner with us at the White House.

41:23.907 --> 41:26.843
Yes. Sir. I'd be honored.
I'II be there. Thank you.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.675
- All right. Have a nice day, pal.
- Yes. Sir. I will.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.180
Bye-bye.

41:44.528 --> 41:48.828
She told us to leave and take the flag
with us. I loaded weapons in the car.

41:50.067 --> 41:51.499
Jimmy.

41:53.070 --> 41:57.268
- Hello. That you, Doug?
- Yeah. I want you to open the gate.

41:57.341 --> 41:58.773
No way.

41:58.841 --> 42:00.901
Come on. Let me in.

42:00.978 --> 42:03.913
I'm actin' on the authority
of the president of the United States.

42:03.981 --> 42:07.280
So what, Doug?
WE got Mrs. Carlisle in here.

42:09.186 --> 42:14.020
Doug, this is Frederick.
I want you to listen very closely.

42:14.091 --> 42:17.527
Jimmy and I are holding
Mrs. Carlisle hostage.

42:18.861 --> 42:20.795
Here is what we want.

42:20.863 --> 42:25.163
We want $100 in unmarked bills...

42:25.234 --> 42:29.034
and a helicopter,
matching sports coats...

42:29.105 --> 42:32.632
and a videocassette
of the movie "Gigi."

42:32.709 --> 42:34.643
Are you listening to me?

42:34.711 --> 42:38.477
- Hello, Earl. Do me a favor.
- Can you hear me?

42:38.548 --> 42:41.517
- Can you talk to Mrs. Carlisle?
- You owe me an apology.

42:41.584 --> 42:43.984
Yeah, probably.
Can you talk to her?

42:44.053 --> 42:47.386
- She hasn't seen anyone.
- Get her to let me in.

42:47.456 --> 42:50.653
If she wants to go out, let me know.
I'll be in the car.

42:50.726 --> 42:52.990
- Okay.
- Than k you.

42:53.062 --> 42:57.499
Okay, Barbara. I guess you might as well
go home. Guys, go home. Get some sleep.

42:58.568 --> 43:01.503
All right. The three of us
will take perimeter positions.

43:01.571 --> 43:05.234
Lee, take Maple. Ralph, go around back.
We'll take our cars. I'll sit out front.

43:05.308 --> 43:08.505
- Let's load this stuff up.
- This is nuts.

43:08.578 --> 43:11.171
You got a better idea?

43:15.350 --> 43:18.343
- The gate's opening. You read me?
- I gotcha, Doug.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.853
Copy that.

43:29.197 --> 43:33.293
Okay, guys. We're rolling.
She's in the Town Car heading west.

43:44.613 --> 43:46.876
Earl, pull over.

43:53.487 --> 43:54.819
What are you doing?

43:54.890 --> 43:56.653
Let's talk.

43:56.725 --> 44:02.162
I took your advice. I did what you
wanted. Now leave me alone. Drive, Earl.

44:23.150 --> 44:25.983
- Stay with the car.
- Yes, ma'am.

44:26.053 --> 44:29.079
Mrs. Carlisle, I was just
on the phone to the president.

44:29.156 --> 44:32.091
- Really?
- Yes, ma'am. He said you should let...

44:32.159 --> 44:34.092
Get away from me.

44:35.429 --> 44:36.862
Yes, ma'am.

45:32.318 --> 45:33.751
Yes?

45:41.226 --> 45:42.660
Barry.

45:50.235 --> 45:54.535
Doug, this is Ralph. I'm goin ' off duty
right now. She hasn't been out all day.

45:54.606 --> 45:58.508
By the way, Frederick said Mrs.
Carlisle’s son is flying in tomorrow.

45:58.577 --> 46:01.012
That 's about it from here.
Later.

46:05.817 --> 46:08.911
Barry! Oh, hello, my darling!

46:08.987 --> 46:10.579
Hi, Mom.

46:12.224 --> 46:13.691
You look so wonderful.

46:13.759 --> 46:15.693
- I missed you.
- Bring in his luggage.

46:15.761 --> 46:19.788
- It's okay. He'll get it.
- Come. Tell me all about your life.

46:19.865 --> 46:23.767
This thing is the best project
that I've seen in years, of its nature.

46:23.834 --> 46:26.201
Here.

46:26.271 --> 46:28.204
What we're talking about...

46:28.273 --> 46:33.438
is 125 detached and semi-detached
retirement villas...

46:33.512 --> 46:38.380
starting from a $125,000
Venice studio layout...

46:38.450 --> 46:42.011
going all the way up to the Tuscany
four-bedroom plan, starting at $799,000.

46:42.087 --> 46:45.021
And at least half of the villas
have a view...

46:45.089 --> 46:47.718
of the nine-hole golf course
designed by Taylor Frye.

46:49.026 --> 46:52.724
The whole project's primo, Mom.
It's first-class the whole way.

46:54.465 --> 46:58.026
The only problem...
And I don't think of it as a problem.

46:58.102 --> 47:01.401
I think of it more like an opportunity.
You know what I mean?

47:01.472 --> 47:03.770
Some of the management
at Top Line Properties got burned...

47:03.841 --> 47:06.571
in the S& L mess
a couple years ago.

47:06.644 --> 47:11.843
So what we're looking to do now
is show people that we are rock solid.

47:11.916 --> 47:15.875
One of the ways of doin g that
is getting people of your stature...

47:15.953 --> 47:17.978
to endorse the project.

47:21.257 --> 47:23.658
All we would need
would be a letter.

47:23.728 --> 47:26.821
Something for the brochure,
saying you think the project's...

47:26.896 --> 47:31.766
a good one for older people looking
for a sun-and-recreation-type lifestyle.

47:31.836 --> 47:34.771
Only downside is, the bank's
being tightfisted in Phoenix...

47:34.839 --> 47:37.068
'cause they made
those stupid loans.

47:37.141 --> 47:40.075
We've got to show people
that they can trust...

47:40.143 --> 47:43.203
the Hacienda Palms concept
down the line.

47:50.053 --> 47:51.714
What?

47:53.024 --> 47:54.957
I said, "No."

48:12.876 --> 48:13.808
Shit!

48:23.987 --> 48:24.119
Joy to the world
The Lord is come

48:24.119 --> 48:28.113
Joy to the world
The Lord is come

48:28.191 --> 48:32.889
Let Earth receive her King

48:32.961 --> 48:35.429
Let Every heart

48:35.497 --> 48:37.590
Prepare Him room

48:37.666 --> 48:39.930
And heaven and nature sing

48:46.810 --> 48:52.338
This is the kind of mandate President
Carlisle wanted from this convention.

48:52.414 --> 48:56.748
This is, for all intents and purposes,
a coronation rather than a nomination.

48:56.819 --> 49:00.050
Jim Carlisle is going to get
everything he wants from the delegates.

49:00.122 --> 49:02.454
They seem ready to
follow him into the...

49:04.693 --> 49:07.389
Their stay at their home
in Summersville.

49:07.463 --> 49:10.829
The two met at nearby Denison College
and fell in love as undergraduates.

49:10.898 --> 49:14.062
Interestingly enough, Tess Carlisle
was the class president...

49:14.136 --> 49:17.765
and Jim Carlisle was the lazy, lacrosse-
playing student with a C average.

49:20.409 --> 49:24.105
Later, in the Rose Garden, the president
put aside his congressional woes...

49:24.178 --> 49:27.306
by welcoming these Girl Scouts
to the White House.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.575
They...

49:29.585 --> 49:32.611
Special news bulletin. The president
suffered a massive heart attack...

49:54.041 --> 49:57.807
WE are now looking
at the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

49:57.879 --> 50:00.939
and, of course, in the front row,

50:01.015 --> 50:05.145
there is the president’s daughter,
Theresa. And her husband.

50:05.219 --> 50:07.949
They have two children
and live in New York City.

50:08.022 --> 50:11.320
On the other side of Mrs. Carlisle,
the president’s son, Barry...

50:11.392 --> 50:15.350
now a very successful businessman
in the state of Arizona.

50:15.428 --> 50:17.363
A very sad, sad day.

50:37.017 --> 50:40.009
Oh. God!
Oh, ow!

50:40.086 --> 50:43.283
You scared me to death!
You sneak ed up on me.

50:43.356 --> 50:44.880
I did no such thing.

50:44.958 --> 50:47.119
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.

50:47.194 --> 50:48.889
Where'd you come from?

50:48.962 --> 50:53.295
I came from that gate,
and I intend to go back the same way.

50:53.366 --> 50:59.271
Mrs. Carlisle? Wait, please.
Look, I was wrong.

50:59.339 --> 51:01.932
- About a lot of things.
- Yes, ma'am.

51:02.007 --> 51:04.772
But I was really wrong
about you refusing protection.

51:04.843 --> 51:07.176
That's the one thing
you were right about.

51:07.247 --> 51:11.445
You suppose the average taxpayer has any
idea how much money is being spent...

51:11.518 --> 51:14.577
to guard all these old political
has-beens and their wives?

51:14.653 --> 51:16.917
- I don't know.
- My God, it's an outrage.

51:16.989 --> 51:18.923
- Yes.
- The cars and the manpower.

51:18.991 --> 51:20.925
- It makes me sick.
- Listen...

51:20.993 --> 51:22.927
Just like e Washington
to spend money like that.

51:22.995 --> 51:25.896
- Can we please talk for one second?
- Just like Washington.

51:25.966 --> 51:28.900
- About what?
- The detail coming back in.

51:30.402 --> 51:33.838
You came out here to ask me something.
What was that about?

51:37.109 --> 51:40.738
Well, I was wondering
if you'd like to have a cup of coffee.

51:40.813 --> 51:42.246
Oh.

51:53.424 --> 51:58.522
Coffee keeps me awake, Doug. Even decaf.
I'd like to have a drink.

52:00.499 --> 52:03.866
I take a drink occasionally.
Not often.

52:04.937 --> 52:06.370
Did you know that?

52:06.437 --> 52:08.632
No, ma'am.

52:08.706 --> 52:10.641
Well, I do.

52:12.845 --> 52:16.576
If I located a bottle,
would you join me in a highball?

52:20.518 --> 52:21.951
Yes, ma'am.

52:24.722 --> 52:29.022
Ah, you're such
a wild and crazy thing.

52:30.094 --> 52:33.461
Well, my daughter
and I barely speak.

52:33.531 --> 52:37.968
Unfortunately, I don't have a
much-improved relationship with my son.

52:39.936 --> 52:43.839
I don't blame them.
The children got screwed.

52:43.908 --> 52:47.968
We got the Governor's Mansion
and the Senate...

52:48.046 --> 52:50.241
the White House.

52:50.315 --> 52:53.250
They got this very
peculiar childhood.

52:57.587 --> 52:59.522
I say, we...

53:00.657 --> 53:03.092
Jim and I
were truly partners.

53:04.329 --> 53:08.594
You must have known, in the White House,
how much he depended on me. Didn't you?

53:08.665 --> 53:10.657
Yes, ma'am.

53:10.734 --> 53:12.999
That was
pretty common knowledge.

53:17.175 --> 53:21.167
You must have known about
my husband's occasional indiscretions.

53:23.580 --> 53:26.515
Didn't think I knew about it,
did you?

53:29.586 --> 53:31.520
Well, did you?

53:34.825 --> 53:37.316
Nobody thought I knew about it,
did they?

53:41.997 --> 53:45.364
Well, let's just keep that
our little secret.

53:45.434 --> 53:48.768
Yes, ma'am.
You can count on me.

53:51.041 --> 53:52.974
I know that.

53:54.044 --> 53:56.978
Douglas, we're getting
out of here.

53:57.047 --> 54:01.484
I’ve talked about myself enough
for one night. Let's talk about you.

54:01.550 --> 54:02.983
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

54:04.987 --> 54:07.922
Oh, well, there's
nothing much to say, ma'am.

54:07.990 --> 54:10.983
Come on, Douglas.
Of course there is.

54:11.060 --> 54:14.861
For in stance, what's it like guar ding
that crazy old bitch, Tess Carlisle?

54:14.930 --> 54:18.866
- Mrs. Carlisle, please.
- It must get pretty screwy.

54:18.934 --> 54:22.165
She lives like a hermit
and plays golf in the snow.

54:23.239 --> 54:25.002
I. Um...

54:25.074 --> 54:27.065
Just the rudimentary facts.
Family. Start there.

54:27.143 --> 54:29.407
Family?

54:29.478 --> 54:31.411
My father is a retired cop.

54:31.480 --> 54:35.415
My mother was a millinery buyer
for a small department store.

54:35.484 --> 54:38.009
Married once, for seven months.

54:38.087 --> 54:42.217
- Come on, Douglas.
- You look ed into my records.

54:43.426 --> 54:47.021
My husband told me.
I do not look into people's records.

54:49.899 --> 54:54.393
Well, was it painful
or a fling?

54:57.072 --> 55:00.007
Everybody seemed to know
what she was like except me.

55:04.012 --> 55:05.446
I'm sorry.

55:05.513 --> 55:08.846
I don't like people knowing about it
because it's embarrassing to me...

55:08.917 --> 55:12.250
that I was married
for such a short time.

55:14.622 --> 55:17.557
You can count on me,
Secret Agent Douglas Chesnic.

55:17.625 --> 55:22.824
Special Secret Agent in Charge
Douglas Chesnic.

55:26.234 --> 55:26.334
Well, congratulations,
Special Agent Douglas.

55:26.334 --> 55:29.235
Well, congratulations,
Special Agent Douglas.

55:29.304 --> 55:32.568
You've been a naughty boy,
but now all is forgiven.

55:32.639 --> 55:35.199
How'd you talk your way
back in here?

55:35.275 --> 55:38.336
Well, Earl, the simple answer is,
she likes me.

55:39.581 --> 55:42.311
- Jimmy, ham and eggs, I think.
- Yes, ma'am.

55:42.382 --> 55:44.442
Good morning, gentlemen.

55:44.519 --> 55:46.850
Good morning, Mrs. Carlisle.

55:46.920 --> 55:50.618
The president is coming to Summersville.
We must prepare for that.

55:50.692 --> 55:53.660
Will you have the cars and the
machine gun s ready in about an hour?

55:53.727 --> 55:55.161
Yes, ma'am.

55:55.230 --> 55:58.824
Good. Thank you.
Frederick, perhaps some sit-ups.

56:10.310 --> 56:13.404
Well, I think it's
a real feather in our cap...

56:13.480 --> 56:16.415
to have the president coming
to the dedication of the final wing.

56:16.483 --> 56:18.883
- Do you?
- Yes, ma'am.

56:18.952 --> 56:20.977
It's a tempest
in a teapot.

56:21.053 --> 56:24.046
But if the president insists on coming,
what can I do...

56:24.124 --> 56:27.025
but try to be gracious
until the whole affair is over with?

56:27.094 --> 56:29.789
Where do you plan
to stage this thing, Mr. Porter?

56:29.862 --> 56:32.923
I thought outside,
at your husband's sepulchre...

56:33.000 --> 56:34.967
we'd put up a tent.

56:35.035 --> 56:39.630
It's of no great concern, and I'm
delighted to leave these matters to you.

56:39.705 --> 56:42.834
But if it were me, I'd have
the presentation in the reading room...

56:42.910 --> 56:44.844
before my husband's portrait.

56:44.912 --> 56:49.507
I'd serve refreshments in the library
with a bar in the adjoining parlor.

56:49.582 --> 56:52.211
What do you think of that,
Mr. Porter?

56:53.619 --> 56:56.851
Well. I think
that would be nice too.

56:56.924 --> 56:58.857
Thank you so much again.

57:02.829 --> 57:05.763
I suppose you're all excited
about the president...

57:05.832 --> 57:08.493
visiting us poor little
country mice.

57:08.568 --> 57:12.629
Yes, ma'am. I see this as a chance
to get my people on their toes again.

57:12.705 --> 57:15.697
- Thinking sharp.
- So you think they're dull too?

57:29.654 --> 57:33.056
Frederick, tell me,
which of these exemplifies...

57:33.124 --> 57:35.388
elegant disdain
yet sincere concern?

57:39.631 --> 57:41.065
That one.

57:41.132 --> 57:44.534
You're good. You know that?
You are very good.

57:48.273 --> 57:50.833
I talk ed to them this morning.
We'll have six of their guys inside.

57:50.909 --> 57:54.743
Ten on the grounds. But we're in charge
of the physical plant. Okay?

57:54.813 --> 57:56.405
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:56.481 --> 57:59.211
Those guys are taking
their orders from us.

58:19.938 --> 58:22.600
Does she want
to be known today?

58:22.674 --> 58:24.607
Don't know her.

58:26.076 --> 58:29.012
- It's got no price at all.
- Yes, ma'am.

58:29.079 --> 58:32.015
This is Bobby in canned goods.
Are you near the manager?

58:32.082 --> 58:35.849
I need a price check on Lesieur
baby peas. Repeat. Lesieur baby peas.

58:37.122 --> 58:38.554
Lesieur baby peas?

58:38.622 --> 58:41.490
They're on special today.
Two for 59cents.

58:41.559 --> 58:44.083
They're on special today.
Two for 59cents.

58:44.161 --> 58:46.823
Uh, copy that.
It's two for 59cents.

58:46.897 --> 58:50.025
- I only want one.
- Roger that. She only wants one.

58:51.335 --> 58:55.738
- How much for just one?
- The same. It's a two-for-one thing.

58:55.806 --> 58:59.970
Bobby, it's a two-for-one thing,
so I suggest you go ahead and get both.

59:01.679 --> 59:04.341
Copy that. I believe
we've lost interest in peas.

59:04.415 --> 59:06.610
Repeat. Lost interest in peas.
Canned goods out.

59:09.186 --> 59:11.654
- Someone's smoking in here.
- Ma'am?

59:11.722 --> 59:15.453
Someone is smoking
in a grocery store.

59:17.094 --> 59:20.620
- Are you going to deal with this?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

59:23.634 --> 59:26.625
Okay. I want one of those
temporary rinses. Not blue hair.

59:26.704 --> 59:28.796
- Yes, ma'am.
- If it's blue, I'll chop it all off.

59:28.871 --> 59:31.305
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. Let's do it.

01:00:00.636 --> 01:00:03.230
I suppose you'd better
give it to her.

01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:07.274
You 're her secretary.

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:16.848
Oh, I love this color.

01:00:16.918 --> 01:00:19.387
Come in.
It's just great.

01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:22.719
Douglas, hello.
Come on, we're back here.

01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:25.385
- Mrs. Carlisle?
- Yes, come in.

01:00:28.096 --> 01:00:31.463
- What do you think of this?
- I think you look beautiful.

01:00:33.068 --> 01:00:34.502
Thank you.

01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:37.299
I've got a fax here
from Washington.

01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:39.135
It's confidential.

01:00:39.207 --> 01:00:41.903
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

01:00:42.978 --> 01:00:45.208
The president's not coming.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.544
Pressing matters of state.

01:00:51.553 --> 01:00:54.716
Well. We can relax then.

01:00:55.557 --> 01:00:57.080
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.851
Will they be sending
someone in his place?

01:01:00.929 --> 01:01:03.226
Secretary of Commerce,
Yvonne Boyer.

01:01:03.298 --> 01:01:06.357
Excellent. That'll make
your job a lot easier.

01:01:06.434 --> 01:01:08.060
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:14.541
Would you be kind enough to send the
hairdresser back to collect her things?

01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:16.474
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:26.587 --> 01:01:29.784
The thing that my husband
would be particularly proud of...

01:01:29.857 --> 01:01:33.918
is that this center is a place
of learning and contemplation.

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:37.953
He would have liked that
very, very much.

01:01:38.032 --> 01:01:40.125
What I am especially proud of...

01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:43.227
is that we took a fine,
wonderful old building...

01:01:43.304 --> 01:01:46.205
and we made it useful again.

01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:48.707
That appeals to me...

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:51.802
perhaps because
I'm getting old myself.

01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:58.441
In closing, I would like to thank
Yvonne Kiki Hernandez-Boyer...

01:01:58.519 --> 01:02:03.149
for taking time out of her hectic
schedule to be here with us today.

01:02:03.224 --> 01:02:05.624
Thank you so much, Kiki, for coming.

01:02:05.693 --> 01:02:09.287
You honor us all with your
gracious, gracious company.

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:41.116
Good morning.

01:02:56.209 --> 01:02:58.040
Yeah. Come in.

01:03:07.719 --> 01:03:08.981
Yes, ma'am?

01:03:09.054 --> 01:03:12.990
I'd like to go on a picnic
tomorrow down by the lake.

01:03:13.058 --> 01:03:16.459
Yes, ma'am. They say
it might snow tomorrow.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:21.395
Well, we can't just
wait on summer, can we?

01:03:22.301 --> 01:03:23.734
I guess not.

01:03:23.802 --> 01:03:28.501
I'd very much appreciate it if I could
go with just you and not everyone else.

01:03:31.944 --> 01:03:33.571
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:35.203
Thank you.

01:03:37.649 --> 01:03:41.311
Is this better than "Mr. Ed"?

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:21.618
Mrs. Carlisle,
I think it's getting colder.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:24.456
Would you leave me alone, please?

01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:26.155
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:11.942
Mrs. Carlisle?

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.007
Ma’am?

01:05:43.138 --> 01:05:45.004
I'll get the chair.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.186
Stop!

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:02.121
Hey, Earl, stop! Damn!

01:06:25.747 --> 01:06:28.010
- Office.
- Are they back yet?

01:06:28.082 --> 01:06:30.517
- Doug?
- Yeah. Are they there?

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:32.247
Who? Mrs. Carlisle?

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.050
- Yes.
- They're not here.

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:35.919
Aren 't they with you?

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:37.582
Call everybody in.
Come get me.

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.734
- Did they get back yet?
- Nope.

01:06:53.074 --> 01:06:56.340
- When did they take off?
- Two-and-a-half hours ago.

01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:57.843
Jesus.

01:07:05.753 --> 01:07:08.347
Who's this?
Tom, they there?

01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:12.085
Call Sheriff Janson and the highway
patrol. Tell them they're out joyriding.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.256
It's not a problem, but inform them that
there's no security with Mrs. Carlisle.

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.730
- Thanks.
- Washington?

01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:22.529
No, not yet.
We'll give them another hour.

01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:25.128
Goddamn her for this.

01:07:34.881 --> 01:07:36.712
Okay, Barbara.

01:07:38.418 --> 01:07:41.251
Let's call Washington.

01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:43.687
This is the worst moment
of my life.

01:08:46.719 --> 01:08:51.452
If she was taken, the people who did it
must have been setting it up for months.

01:08:51.524 --> 01:08:54.356
- Yes, sir.
- Did you notice anything suspicious?

01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:56.452
No, sir.

01:08:56.528 --> 01:08:58.758
Nothing at all?

01:08:58.831 --> 01:09:00.492
No, sir.

01:09:01.734 --> 01:09:05.863
I have to call the president
when we get to the Carlisle place.

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.529
Yes. Sir.

01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:13.201
It'll be almost midnight
by then, Mr. Harrison.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.212
That's no problem.
He's up.

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:30.890
- Thanks for coming in.
- Sure.

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.023
Excuse me.

01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:48.671
I would appreciate it
if you'd put something under there...

01:09:48.747 --> 01:09:51.340
so that we don't
scratch the table.

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:55.815
Doug, why don't you
come in here with me.

01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:03.992
Doug, this is Charles Ivy, CIA.

01:10:04.062 --> 01:10:07.293
Doug here is agent in charge
for Mrs. Carlisle.

01:10:07.365 --> 01:10:11.494
Mr. President, I've got
Agent Doug Chesnic with me.

01:10:15.873 --> 01:10:18.136
Does he want to speak with me?

01:10:20.445 --> 01:10:24.039
She has a full-time nurse.
What's that for?

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.985
She's had some dizziness
the last couple of years...

01:10:31.054 --> 01:10:33.386
and he monitors her medication...

01:10:33.457 --> 01:10:36.290
makes sure she's eating right,
that kind of stuff.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.954
Seven well-trained,
heavily-armed men...

01:10:39.029 --> 01:10:42.055
can't take care of
one little old lady.

01:10:42.132 --> 01:10:44.259
You disgust me.

01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:48.364
Yes. Sir.

01:10:48.439 --> 01:10:51.464
Doug, Sheriff Janson's on the phone.

01:10:51.541 --> 01:10:52.838
Who's that?

01:10:52.909 --> 01:10:55.104
- Local sheriff.
- What's he got?

01:10:55.178 --> 01:10:57.146
It's for Agent Chesnic.

01:10:58.648 --> 01:11:01.173
Doug, why don't you
take it in the kitchen.

01:11:30.046 --> 01:11:32.309
They found the car
on a country road.

01:11:33.616 --> 01:11:36.881
Driver unconscious
on the front seat.

01:11:36.953 --> 01:11:39.716
He's being taken
to a county hospital.

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:43.681
Mrs. Carlisle was not at the scene.

01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:47.595
Jesus Christ.

01:11:48.697 --> 01:11:49.959
Mr. President...

01:11:50.032 --> 01:11:52.796
Tess Carlisle has been kidnapped.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.093
I thought you'd appreciate an update.

01:12:56.164 --> 01:12:59.361
A plastic syringe was found
on the floor of the front seat.

01:12:59.434 --> 01:13:04.097
The lab says it contains a combination
of extremely powerful drugs.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.265
Ketamine and Ativan.

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:08.740
Both are common.
Easy to steal...

01:13:08.809 --> 01:13:11.506
and used together would
knock out a full-grown man...

01:13:11.579 --> 01:13:14.412
within ten seconds
of being injected.

01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:18.418
A big enough shot would
keep him down for up to six...

01:13:18.485 --> 01:13:20.214
seven hours.

01:13:20.287 --> 01:13:23.313
Which squares...

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.483
with how long
your guy was out.

01:13:25.559 --> 01:13:27.891
We take it as a good sign
that they used the drug...

01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:31.453
instead of killing him.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.727
The injuries...

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.759
on the back of the driver's neck
are burns, which is interesting.

01:13:37.838 --> 01:13:42.332
They're both in the shape of a small
crescent, smaller than a quarter.

01:13:43.644 --> 01:13:46.204
My friends from the CIA
think it might be a brand...

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.910
a signature kind of thing for
a Middle Eastern terrorist organization.

01:13:52.352 --> 01:13:56.049
Also, we spoke
to Mrs. Carlisle's doctor.

01:13:56.123 --> 01:13:58.318
Those pills...

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.122
that she takes for dizziness...

01:14:02.428 --> 01:14:04.829
Actually it's a little
more serious than that.

01:14:04.897 --> 01:14:09.858
She has an inoperable brain tumor.
Did any of you know that?

01:14:14.874 --> 01:14:18.173
We'll have fiber and fingerprint
reports by late afternoon.

01:14:18.244 --> 01:14:22.271
And a note was found
in the car's glove compartment...

01:14:22.348 --> 01:14:25.181
demanding $15 million.

01:14:26.752 --> 01:14:32.622
That's about it, except
we're gonna need these offices.

01:14:32.692 --> 01:14:35.820
You can all go home
if you want to.

01:14:35.895 --> 01:14:39.660
That's the best thing to do,
I think. Thanks.

01:14:42.467 --> 01:14:44.662
Well. Let's...

01:14:44.736 --> 01:14:47.638
get any personal stuff
and get out.

01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:54.337
What's with that nonsense
about Middle Eastern terrorists?

01:14:54.413 --> 01:14:58.076
Can you imagine a bunch of Arabs
slipping around Summersville unnoticed?

01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:01.915
What about this plastic syringe in
the car? Does that bother anybody else?

01:15:01.988 --> 01:15:05.424
If these guys are such pros,
why would they leave that behind?

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.856
It had to be left there on purpose.

01:15:07.926 --> 01:15:10.190
How long has she been gone?

01:15:11.262 --> 01:15:13.958
Twenty-two hours and 30 minutes.

01:15:21.139 --> 01:15:24.438
- Doug, can I get a ride with you?
- Yes.

01:15:31.716 --> 01:15:34.014
Mrs. Carlisle...

01:15:34.085 --> 01:15:36.781
hired me.

01:15:36.855 --> 01:15:39.881
I know, Kimberly.
We'll find her.

01:15:42.793 --> 01:15:46.059
When others wouldn't.

01:16:10.621 --> 01:16:12.816
Make this quick.
I'm busy.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.154
I want you to think about this.

01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:18.319
Mrs. Carlisle's sitting
in the back of the Lincoln, right?

01:16:18.395 --> 01:16:22.695
If she's been taken against her will,
she know she won't just take that.

01:16:22.766 --> 01:16:25.030
She's gonna take
some form of action.

01:16:25.102 --> 01:16:27.695
What does she have
in the back seat as a weapon?

01:16:27.771 --> 01:16:31.969
- I don't know.
- Cigarette lighter, right in the door.

01:16:32.041 --> 01:16:33.634
Makes a crescent-shaped burn.

01:16:33.711 --> 01:16:35.234
You getting anywhere?

01:16:35.311 --> 01:16:39.612
We'll know more
when all the lab stuff comes in.

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:43.311
If there's anything I can do,
Mr. Shaeffer...

01:16:43.386 --> 01:16:47.721
or Doug, just ask me.

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:50.021
Thank you.

01:16:50.094 --> 01:16:52.425
Can we have a look at your neck?

01:16:53.563 --> 01:16:55.896
Yeah, I guess.
What for?

01:16:55.965 --> 01:16:58.934
It's just such a peculiar thing.

01:16:59.001 --> 01:17:01.435
Let me get a nurse
to help with the bandage.

01:17:05.508 --> 01:17:07.601
What's this about?

01:17:07.677 --> 01:17:10.339
He just wants to see the burns.

01:17:10.413 --> 01:17:12.847
He thinks they're
the key to this case.

01:17:14.383 --> 01:17:16.715
- The burns?
- Yeah.

01:17:18.488 --> 01:17:22.891
I told them, I don't know how they
got there because I was unconscious.

01:17:27.362 --> 01:17:29.627
- Could you sit up, please?
- Okay.

01:17:40.909 --> 01:17:44.003
- What do you think?
- About the burns?

01:17:45.714 --> 01:17:49.206
- We got a couple of ideas.
- Like what?

01:17:49.284 --> 01:17:50.945
Just ideas.

01:18:07.302 --> 01:18:10.066
I certainly hope you're not
gonna try to pin this on me.

01:18:11.173 --> 01:18:13.232
I wasn't the one who arranged...

01:18:13.308 --> 01:18:15.742
for Mrs. Carlisle to be
out in the middle of nowhere...

01:18:15.811 --> 01:18:18.575
and guarded by only one agent.

01:18:18.647 --> 01:18:21.706
And I also wasn't the one who...

01:18:21.782 --> 01:18:24.411
hated Mrs. Carlisle with a vengeance.

01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:28.785
That was Agent Chesnic here.
Did he tell you that?

01:18:28.856 --> 01:18:31.518
- You hated her?
- With a vengeance.

01:18:31.592 --> 01:18:35.222
- I actually like her very much.
- They argued all the time.

01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:37.161
Isn't that right?

01:18:37.231 --> 01:18:40.359
Is that normal for an agent
to be arguing with is...

01:18:40.434 --> 01:18:42.595
No. Of course it's not.

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:45.901
You should be asking him the questions.
He hated her guts.

01:18:45.973 --> 01:18:50.273
Look, look.
She treated these guys like dirt.

01:18:50.344 --> 01:18:55.145
You know what I mean? She threw them
all out of the house a few weeks ago.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.379
Can I have a cigarette?

01:19:01.455 --> 01:19:04.913
Sorry, don't smoke.
Why are you suddenly so upset?

01:19:04.992 --> 01:19:06.926
I'm not upset.

01:19:08.762 --> 01:19:10.696
Well, wouldn't you be?

01:19:13.067 --> 01:19:16.036
Look, I may be only the driver...

01:19:16.102 --> 01:19:19.072
but I'm at least
smart enough to know...

01:19:19.139 --> 01:19:22.107
that you guys are not gonna leave town
without putting somebody in jail...

01:19:22.175 --> 01:19:24.575
and that somebody
doesn't have to be guilty.

01:19:24.644 --> 01:19:26.909
I know how you guys operate.

01:19:26.981 --> 01:19:29.642
You did it. Didn't you, Earl?

01:19:29.716 --> 01:19:32.480
The hell with you, okay, Dougie?

01:19:32.552 --> 01:19:33.986
It was easy, wasn't it?

01:19:34.054 --> 01:19:37.546
Will you get him out of my face?
I'm not putting up with this.

01:19:37.624 --> 01:19:39.616
- All right.
- Okay.

01:19:39.693 --> 01:19:43.822
But I'm gonna have to warn you that
the FBI now considers you a suspect.

01:19:43.897 --> 01:19:47.833
- That's just terrific.
- I suggest you get a lawyer soon.

01:19:47.901 --> 01:19:50.336
Don't you worry.
I'm gonna protect myself.

01:19:50.403 --> 01:19:50.536
Where is she?

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.026
Where is she?

01:19:53.473 --> 01:19:56.874
Speak to my lawyer, Agent Dougie.

01:19:56.943 --> 01:19:59.138
All right, that's it for now.

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:02.943
No more questions, but we're going
to have to have you available to us.

01:20:03.016 --> 01:20:04.779
At our convenience.

01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:07.444
All right?
Oh, no, Doug.

01:20:08.454 --> 01:20:12.550
Let's not be stupid here, all right?

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:15.025
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:20:15.094 --> 01:20:19.962
Doug, we're the good guys, okay?
We don't do stuff like this.

01:20:20.033 --> 01:20:24.367
Don't you get it? I'm the only witness,
and he wants to kill me.

01:20:24.436 --> 01:20:26.904
- Doesn't that tell you anything?
- Come on, Doug.

01:20:26.972 --> 01:20:30.568
- I'm telling you to holster your pistol.
- Jesus help me.

01:20:30.643 --> 01:20:33.634
Goddamn it, Doug,
put that gun away.

01:20:33.712 --> 01:20:36.238
You're already in so much trouble!

01:20:36.315 --> 01:20:39.308
- He's gonna tell me.
- I don't know anything.

01:20:39.385 --> 01:20:41.477
We can't use it.
Not like this!

01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:46.987
I'm going to count to five...

01:20:47.059 --> 01:20:48.993
then I'll shoot off your toe.

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:50.426
Oh. God!

01:20:50.495 --> 01:20:54.090
And then I'm gonna count to five
and shoot another toe.

01:20:54.833 --> 01:20:57.768
I don't know anything!
Will you get that through your...

01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:01.764
Are you crazy? Are you?

01:21:01.839 --> 01:21:05.502
- He didn't count!
- Five. Four...

01:21:05.576 --> 01:21:07.340
You're going to prison.

01:21:07.412 --> 01:21:10.540
Will you just listen to me?
If he is involved...

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:13.845
- Nurse. Should we call the police?
- Yes, and the FBI!

01:21:13.918 --> 01:21:17.082
If he is involved,
then she knows it.

01:21:17.155 --> 01:21:19.919
And if she knows it,
her life is worthless.

01:21:19.992 --> 01:21:24.121
They have to fucking kill her!
We don't have time to meet his lawyer!

01:21:24.195 --> 01:21:26.892
- God help me!
- Five. Four...

01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:29.194
three, two...

01:21:29.267 --> 01:21:30.858
Okay! Okay!

01:21:32.403 --> 01:21:35.497
They've got her
in an abandoned farmhouse.

01:21:35.573 --> 01:21:37.837
- An abandoned farmhouse?
- Yeah.

01:21:37.908 --> 01:21:39.671
I don't think so. Five...

01:21:39.744 --> 01:21:43.510
I swear to God. I swear to God.
Doug, really, listen.

01:21:43.581 --> 01:21:46.482
It's my sister and her husband.
Check it out.

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:49.951
It wasn't my idea!
I swear to God!

01:21:53.991 --> 01:21:56.323
They made me do it!

01:21:57.962 --> 01:22:00.590
Mrs. Carlisle's all right, Doug...

01:22:00.664 --> 01:22:04.895
because my sister
is taking very good care of her.

01:22:16.179 --> 01:22:17.511
Freeze!

01:22:21.051 --> 01:22:22.643
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:22:50.312 --> 01:22:52.975
- She's over here.
- Where?

01:22:53.049 --> 01:22:56.280
There. She's down there.

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:57.978
What?

01:22:58.054 --> 01:22:59.988
Take that off.

01:23:01.123 --> 01:23:03.956
You buried her?
Jesus Christ. She alive?

01:23:04.026 --> 01:23:06.688
Yeah. Pretty sure.

01:23:06.762 --> 01:23:09.526
You put her down there, what?
Over 30 hours ago?

01:23:09.598 --> 01:23:12.431
This is not a young woman.
Better start praying.

01:23:12.501 --> 01:23:15.470
What did you do?
What did you do?

01:23:16.672 --> 01:23:19.005
Take it easy!

01:23:21.577 --> 01:23:23.010
Get him out of her e!

01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:45.498
Look how deep this is.
They weren't gonna dig this woman up.

01:23:45.567 --> 01:23:48.127
Keep her alive for a day or two,
in case you had to have her...

01:23:48.203 --> 01:23:50.603
just cut the ventilation and walk.

01:23:50.672 --> 01:23:54.198
- Who let you back in?
- We want to dig. We're responsible.

01:23:54.275 --> 01:23:57.211
You're upset. Wait outside.
Let the experts do it.

01:24:00.014 --> 01:24:02.278
Okay, dig.
Get out of there.

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:05.684
- Give these men the shovels.
- Thank you.

01:24:14.996 --> 01:24:16.429
Give me the shovel.

01:24:31.712 --> 01:24:34.545
- I think I found something!
- Pull up the pipe.

01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:37.106
Is she down there?

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:47.393
Mrs. Carlisle?

01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:48.894
Ma'am?

01:24:51.832 --> 01:24:54.858
Somebody get a power saw.
Come on, move!

01:24:56.303 --> 01:25:00.172
I want soap, water and blankets.
Nobody sees her like this.

01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:47.645
Sir, that's too many.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.088
- We're getting on.
- No can do, pal.

01:25:51.157 --> 01:25:54.058
All right. We'll meet them
at the hospital.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:07.299
- What do you think?
- She's alive. That's all I know.

01:26:07.373 --> 01:26:09.807
Come on, guys. Snap it up!

01:26:28.093 --> 01:26:31.654
Hey! Anybody out here
named Douglas Chesnic?

01:26:32.898 --> 01:26:34.661
Doug Chesnic!

01:26:54.686 --> 01:26:56.711
I'm Chesnic.
What is it?

01:26:56.788 --> 01:27:01.248
Lady's awake, sir. Says she's not going
without her Secret Service detail.

01:27:01.326 --> 01:27:03.385
- Is that you guys?
- That's us.

01:27:03.461 --> 01:27:05.122
Can you come aboard?

01:27:06.431 --> 01:27:08.524
Yeah. We can do that.

01:27:10.501 --> 01:27:12.867
Wait one second, sir.

01:27:15.006 --> 01:27:18.305
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I have to throw some of you off.

01:28:16.233 --> 01:28:18.861
- She gonna be all right?
- Looks like it.

01:28:25.242 --> 01:28:26.800
Where have you been?

01:28:26.877 --> 01:28:28.845
Looking for you.

01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:33.042
How long did it take you to figure out
the cigarette lighter burns?

01:28:34.617 --> 01:28:36.051
About 22 hours.

01:28:36.119 --> 01:28:38.348
Oh, Douglas, it was so obvious.

01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:40.982
No it wasn't.
Nobody got it but me.

01:28:41.056 --> 01:28:42.819
I can hardly believe that.

01:28:42.892 --> 01:28:46.157
- It's true.
- Howard Shaeffer, FBI.

01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:49.755
If I may say, ma'am, Agent Chesnic
is the reason we found you.

01:28:49.832 --> 01:28:52.494
- If he hadn't shot a man...
- Shot a man?

01:28:52.568 --> 01:28:54.001
Yes, ma'am.

01:28:54.069 --> 01:28:57.368
You finally got to shoot
somebody, huh, Douglas?

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.637
- Did you kill him?
- Shot him in the toe.

01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:03.337
Oh, after all that practice.

01:29:04.713 --> 01:29:07.648
- Yes. Ma'am.
- If I could set the record straight...

01:29:07.716 --> 01:29:10.707
I'd just like to talk to this
gentleman, if you don't mind.

01:29:36.478 --> 01:29:40.312
I'll get it, dear.
Tell the others I'll be out in a minute.

01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:42.816
- Hello?
- The president’s returning your call.

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:44.819
- Yes, thank you.
- Yes, ma 'am.

01:29:46.188 --> 01:29:49.156
Are they treating you all right
in that hospital? If they’re not...

01:29:49.224 --> 01:29:53.251
Harold, I want this Secret Service agent
of mine taken care of.

01:29:53.328 --> 01:29:55.853
Tess, the man discharged
a firearm in a public place.

01:29:55.930 --> 01:29:59.093
I don't care about any of that.
This young man saved my life.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:02.830
He's like a son to me, Harold.
I want him taken care of, understand?

01:30:02.904 --> 01:30:04.838
Sure, Tess.
I'm sure we...

01:30:04.905 --> 01:30:07.931
And if anything should
ever happen to me...

01:30:08.009 --> 01:30:12.412
I want your personal word
that you will look after him.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.505
- Sure, Tess...
- Good.

01:30:14.582 --> 01:30:17.379
That's all I wanted to know.
Have yourself a nice day.

01:30:17.451 --> 01:30:18.885
Yes, ma 'am.

01:30:24.025 --> 01:30:25.457
What is this?

01:30:25.526 --> 01:30:27.460
It's your wheelchair, ma'am.

01:30:27.528 --> 01:30:30.965
I can see it's a wheelchair,
but I won't be needing it, thank you.

01:30:31.032 --> 01:30:33.465
It's hospital policy
that you leave by wheelchair.

01:30:33.534 --> 01:30:36.833
But I would really prefer
not to sit in the wheelchair.

01:30:36.904 --> 01:30:41.604
I would much rather walk on my own feet,
with my own steam, out of the hospital.

01:30:41.676 --> 01:30:44.667
But the rules and regulations
state that each patient...

01:30:44.745 --> 01:30:46.906
Oh. The rules.

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.973
Rules and regulations, young man,
are not something I'm fond of.

01:30:51.052 --> 01:30:52.985
So if you would just allow me...

01:30:53.053 --> 01:30:55.283
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:30:55.355 --> 01:30:57.982
I am not going to sit in that!

01:31:01.495 --> 01:31:03.929
If I may interrupt.

01:31:05.532 --> 01:31:08.865
The regulations aren't really
that sacred, are they?

01:31:09.903 --> 01:31:10.835
And Tess...

01:31:13.773 --> 01:31:16.504
get in the goddamn chair.
