00:03.500 --> 00:06.370
<i>When </i>Elder Tale<i> was a game, 
one goal was to make</i>

00:06.370 --> 00:09.730
<i>the game world a one-half-scale model of Earth.</i>

00:10.970 --> 00:12.550
<i>The Half Gaia Project.</i>

00:13.620 --> 00:15.650
<i>In this world, the land corresponding to Japan</i>

00:15.650 --> 00:18.560
<i>is known as the Crescent Islands of Yamato...</i>

00:20.210 --> 00:23.630
<i>The northernmost area of 
which is the Ezzo Empire.</i>

02:00.130 --> 02:03.710
Brigandia's the guild that's bossing 
people around in Susukino, right?

02:04.390 --> 02:06.650
Even when this was a game, 
they had a bad reputation.

02:07.390 --> 02:10.230
To them, this world must be heaven.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.650
Yes, thank you.

02:13.810 --> 02:14.510
Goodbye.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.240
What did they say?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.980
Marie will talk to Serara.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.290
Roger.

02:21.780 --> 02:22.960
But, my lord...

02:23.580 --> 02:26.380
Why are we meeting them in the city?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.790
Is it unsafe outside?

02:28.620 --> 02:32.840
If we meet up outside and 
are wiped out in a fight,

02:33.660 --> 02:35.570
we'd revive in the Akihabara Cathedral,

02:36.090 --> 02:39.520
but Serara would revive at 
the Susukino Cathedral.

02:40.580 --> 02:41.560
I understand.

02:42.190 --> 02:43.560
Serara is on

02:43.560 --> 02:47.290
a Brigandia member's Friend List, right?

02:47.700 --> 02:48.640
Yeah.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.360
Her current hiding spot is within a 
private zone, so they can't find her.

02:54.550 --> 02:59.450
But the minute she leaves, 
they'll locate her and send pursuit.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.020
So she's gotta get out before they catch up.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.450
Akatsuki, I'd like you to hide yourself 
with Sneak and Silent Move, please.

03:06.810 --> 03:07.750
No "please," my lord.

03:11.950 --> 03:17.650
<i>Sneak enables self-concealment, while 
Silent Move allows motion without any sound.</i>

03:17.650 --> 03:19.130
<i>They're tracker-class skills.</i>

03:20.570 --> 03:23.510
Then, let's get this plan in gear!

03:24.100 --> 03:30.020
<b>Escape</b>

03:25.980 --> 03:27.380
Escape.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.710
<b>Location Search</b>

03:31.710 --> 03:32.650
<b>Location Search 

Target Not Within Specified Area</b>

03:33.510 --> 03:36.970
Where are you hiding, Serara?

03:37.440 --> 03:40.240
How long are you going 
to obsess over that girl?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.980
You've gotta keep a tight lead on your pets...

03:42.980 --> 03:45.410
Let them know who's boss.

03:47.590 --> 03:48.830
Demikas!

03:49.900 --> 03:50.810
What's wrong?

03:50.810 --> 03:51.800
Well...

03:55.110 --> 03:56.800
Two guys you don't know?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.880
They appear to be outsiders.

03:59.550 --> 04:00.720
<b>Displaying Serara's location</b>

04:00.720 --> 04:03.290
<b>Displaying Serara's location 
Susukino: Corridors of Time</b>

04:04.020 --> 04:05.410
Looks like they noticed us.

04:05.730 --> 04:06.510
Yeah.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.560
Anyway, talk about a nasty atmosphere...

04:16.410 --> 04:17.730
This is the place.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.030
Akatsuki, keep watch.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.420
Understood.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.710
Naotsugu, you wait here.

04:23.710 --> 04:24.650
Roger.

04:29.550 --> 04:31.410
U-Um...

04:32.540 --> 04:37.960
<b>Serara 

Race/ Human
Druid, Lv. 19</b>

04:33.730 --> 04:36.590
I'm Serara, of the Crescent Moon Alliance.

04:36.590 --> 04:37.810
Um...

04:37.810 --> 04:40.710
Thank you for coming!

04:43.620 --> 04:44.510
Meow.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.000
Wait...

04:48.190 --> 04:49.760
Is that you, Chief?!

04:49.760 --> 04:50.970
Meow.

04:52.210 --> 04:56.310
Oh, my... If it isn't little Shiroe.

04:56.650 --> 05:01.820
<b>Nyanta 
Race/ Cat-man
Swashbuckler, Lv. 90</b>

04:57.180 --> 05:01.820
That explains how you arrived so quickly.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.820
U-Um...

05:03.820 --> 05:05.880
Ah, well...

05:05.880 --> 05:07.530
I'm sorry, Serara.

05:07.980 --> 05:09.870
My name is Shiroe.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.950
He's a very smart kid, and a very good one.

05:12.950 --> 05:19.250
If he's here, our plan is sure to work.

05:19.730 --> 05:23.010
I see you still meow all the time, Chief.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.010
What are you talking about?

05:25.470 --> 05:29.140
This is the correct way for cat people to talk.

05:29.140 --> 05:32.140
D-Do you know each other?

05:32.420 --> 05:34.390
I suppose we do.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.500
Little Shiroe used to check me for fleas.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.770
I did not.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.740
I can go back to Akihabara.

05:44.690 --> 05:47.290
But what about Nyanta?

05:47.790 --> 05:49.170
Naotsugu is with me.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.910
And one other, a girl named Akatsuki...

05:53.270 --> 05:55.000
A level-90 assassin.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.180
She's good.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.670
Then little Naotsugu's here, too?

06:00.220 --> 06:03.070
And a new friend?

06:03.550 --> 06:08.250
I think it would be best if 
you came with us, Chief.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.540
That's fine.

06:10.140 --> 06:11.590
I have no reason to stay.

06:12.100 --> 06:16.600
Perhaps it is a sign from above, 
telling me to go to Akihabara.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.600
Then...

06:18.600 --> 06:19.730
Meow.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.950
Nyanta!

06:23.710 --> 06:24.620
Akatsuki?

06:26.300 --> 06:27.210
Which direction?

06:28.570 --> 06:30.660
They're coming from the north.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.330
On their way, they're searching the town.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.620
But they're close enough to be here in five minutes.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.650
Their leader seems to be an 
enormous martial artist.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.630
He's a monk, but...

06:42.620 --> 06:44.710
Like a bear carved out of wood?

06:44.710 --> 06:48.730
That would be Brigandia's guild master, Demikas.

06:54.170 --> 06:54.970
Naotsugu...

06:55.860 --> 06:56.990
I'm here.

06:57.540 --> 06:58.530
I see.

06:58.530 --> 06:59.230
Roger.

07:00.030 --> 07:00.960
Thanks.

07:01.940 --> 07:02.980
Let's go.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.110
We'll take the rear exit.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.240
Londark...

07:12.330 --> 07:13.230
Ah...

07:13.670 --> 07:15.510
So the outsiders really were here for Serara.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.160
Yes.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.740
The transport gate is shut down.

07:20.210 --> 07:22.830
Where did they come from?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.590
Interesting.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.840
It's okay.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.290
They won't attack yet.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.690
Fighting isn't allowed within towns.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.730
They'll wait until we're outside to attack.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.670
Th-Then how will we escape?

07:46.150 --> 07:47.230
Hmm...

07:47.890 --> 07:51.350
If they're letting us leave, then we just go.

07:52.260 --> 07:54.180
That makes things easier...

07:54.180 --> 07:57.260
B-But if we leave...

07:57.840 --> 08:00.680
They might attack us, right?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.190
Not "might." They will.

08:04.200 --> 08:10.010
Once we're outside the no-PvP zone, 
their plan is to surround and PK us.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.110
Their first priority will probably be 
your confederate, Chief Nyanta.

08:16.010 --> 08:19.440
That will destroy your will and 
put you under their control.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.890
I'm almost certain of that.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.020
N-No...

08:26.020 --> 08:27.960
There are so many of them...

08:27.960 --> 08:30.450
They might kill us!

08:30.450 --> 08:32.800
You can't...

08:32.800 --> 08:34.810
Now, now, Serara...

08:34.810 --> 08:38.120
Just leave this to Shiroe, and you'll be fine.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.170
B-But...

08:43.180 --> 08:45.180
We've been looking for you.

08:45.180 --> 08:47.520
Serara...

08:58.870 --> 09:00.070
Chief Nyanta?

09:00.070 --> 09:01.100
What?

09:01.370 --> 09:03.600
If you went one-on-one with 
the enemy leader...

09:04.250 --> 09:05.810
A foolish question.

09:09.690 --> 09:10.810
Don't worry.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.990
I won't let them touch you, Serara.

09:16.780 --> 09:20.530
Which of you is Brigandia's Demi-glace?

09:24.660 --> 09:26.780
Now, Shiroe...

09:26.780 --> 09:30.980
Asking something so loudly is rude.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.210
I know which one he is.

09:33.790 --> 09:37.220
It's the excessively huge guy sitting over there.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.130
Hey, Demikas!

09:44.110 --> 09:46.850
It's been a long time, Serara.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.400
You didn't think you could disobey 
me and get away with it, did you?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.150
<b>Londark 
Race/ Elf
Sorcerer, Lv. 90</b>

09:54.240 --> 09:56.630
If you come back now, I'll forgive you.

09:56.630 --> 10:00.280
Of course, I'll send you to the 
Cathedral ten times first!

09:57.820 --> 10:00.270
<b>Demikas 
Race/ Human
Monk, Lv. 90</b>

10:03.730 --> 10:06.460
Recklessness is the way of the young.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.490
And tolerance is the beauty of adulthood.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.170
But...

10:11.170 --> 10:13.380
There is such a thing as going too far.

10:13.810 --> 10:14.920
Huh?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.950
You've gone too far.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.710
Reigning in children who stray too far

10:19.710 --> 10:22.080
beyond the lines is also an adult's job.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.730
Come on, I'll fight you one-on-one.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.060
Ridiculous.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.980
Why should I fight you?

10:29.980 --> 10:32.900
Are you afraid to face me alone?

10:32.900 --> 10:33.970
What?!

10:34.650 --> 10:37.860
Sorry to interrupt, Mister, uh...

10:37.860 --> 10:38.970
Delicious.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.740
But it doesn't have to be you.

10:43.470 --> 10:46.370
I'd prefer the one in the gray robe.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.570
Isn't that an artifact drop from 
the Fire Lizard's Cave?

10:51.170 --> 10:53.220
You seem stronger.

10:53.220 --> 10:57.130
Have you heard my name, Londark of Gray Steel?

10:57.320 --> 10:58.920
So you have a nickname...

10:59.560 --> 11:00.580
No wonder.

11:01.580 --> 11:04.610
It would be more satisfying for both of us

11:04.610 --> 11:06.890
if the strongest fighters settled things.

11:07.390 --> 11:10.010
We'll have our Chief Nyanta fight you.

11:10.660 --> 11:13.020
Let us finish this.

11:13.240 --> 11:17.530
We can ignore the cowardly meatball here, 
as he's too scared to fight himself.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.070
Very well...

11:20.570 --> 11:22.280
If you want to fight that much...

11:25.510 --> 11:28.330
I'll fight you!

11:37.170 --> 11:38.300
It's been a long time...

11:41.120 --> 11:43.330
since I've gotten to devour someone.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.850
Nyanta!

11:52.150 --> 11:56.020
I'd rather the lady didn't see anything too gory.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.690
If you want me to go easy, tell me quickly.

12:00.610 --> 12:01.860
Just keep talking.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.720
<i>Demikas is in the monk class.</i>

<i>Cool down time is how long it takes before</i>

<i>Phantom Step!</i>

12:57.190 --> 13:01.130
Did you think you could defeat me 
with those little toy swords?

13:02.320 --> 13:03.780
How rude.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.290
A rapier is a gentleman's weapon.

But...

13:21.660 --> 13:24.320
<i>The swashbuckler...</i>

13:25.380 --> 13:29.530
<i>It's one of the specialized weapon classes,

<i>Lowered attack, lowered dodge,

<i>They can negate an opponent's strengths...</i>

13:51.530 --> 13:54.230
<i>Doesn't it look like Demikas is losing?</i>

13:55.350 --> 13:59.460
Stop jumping around, and fight fair and square!

13:59.460 --> 14:05.360
Coming from you, "fair and square" sounds 
like a bastardization of our fair language.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.730

14:08.880 --> 14:11.690
When I give the signal, I want you to 
cast a healing pulse on everyone.

Everyone?

14:15.290 --> 14:17.540

R-Right.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.680
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

14:38.100 --> 14:39.910
That isn't fair...

14:40.330 --> 14:43.480
Healer teams, heal Demikas.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.290
Right.

14:47.490 --> 14:52.490
<b>Demikas 
Race/ Human
Monk, Lv. 90</b>

14:51.970 --> 14:52.870
It's fine...

14:53.210 --> 14:55.580
Take out the guardian first.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.350
Right!

14:57.310 --> 14:58.390
Die!

14:58.390 --> 15:00.580
No... They'll kill him!

15:01.030 --> 15:03.220
Heal everyone! Now!

15:04.930 --> 15:05.880
Right!

15:07.690 --> 15:10.140
<i>Heartbeat Healing!</i>

15:13.560 --> 15:17.760
<i>Druid is one of the healing classes.</i>

15:18.350 --> 15:21.860
<b>Nyanta

15:19.040 --> 15:23.450
<i>Once they cast a healing pulse on someone, 
it remains in effect for a short time.</i>

15:25.120 --> 15:26.480
Oh, no...

15:26.480 --> 15:27.900
I can't keep this up!

15:28.630 --> 15:30.190
My level isn't high enough.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.510
Don't worry about Naotsugu.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.010
Focus on Nyanta.

15:35.490 --> 15:38.000
But... They're both in danger!

15:39.100 --> 15:40.920
If you can't do something, then don't.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.070
Focus on what you can.

15:52.690 --> 15:53.680
<i>Heal!</i>

15:57.850 --> 15:59.270
What's this?

16:04.350 --> 16:07.610
Must be hard to get by 
with one crappy healer,

16:08.880 --> 16:09.910
cat...

16:10.500 --> 16:12.810
No, it isn't!

16:13.240 --> 16:14.780
Just shut up.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.410
Your friend, the warrior, is about to go down!

16:15.830 --> 16:18.400
<b>Naotsugu</b>

16:18.410 --> 16:20.520

Shiro!

16:26.590 --> 16:27.740
Ready the spell.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.210
R-Right.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.250
<i>Castle of Stone!</i>

16:41.840 --> 16:43.230
No damage?

16:43.940 --> 16:45.210
<i>Castle of Stone...</i>

16:46.030 --> 16:50.070
<i>This spell blocks all damage 
for a ten-second period.</i>

16:50.800 --> 16:53.960
<i>An emergency-defense skill 
only available to guardians.</i>

16:55.550 --> 16:56.410
Now.

16:56.780 --> 16:58.140
Cast all your healing spells on Naotsugu!

16:58.690 --> 16:59.540
Okay.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.490
<i>Healing Wind!</i>

17:05.420 --> 17:07.290
<b>Naotsugu</b>

17:05.890 --> 17:08.800
Buying time won't save you, Serara.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.090
Castle of Stone has a ten-minute cool down!

17:12.090 --> 17:16.290
If he's using a skill he can't use 
again for another ten minutes,

17:16.290 --> 17:19.140
that guardian must be out of options.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.060
He must be starting to panic.

17:23.060 --> 17:26.440
When the spell runs out, you're dead.

17:27.410 --> 17:30.750
You've made this harder 
than it had to be, Serara.

17:32.610 --> 17:36.570
<b>Serara                                    Naotsugu</b>

17:44.650 --> 17:47.090
Think it's about time...

17:47.920 --> 17:49.180
Shiroe?

17:49.710 --> 17:52.460
Here we go, Chief Nyanta.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.510
What are you talking about?

17:55.850 --> 17:57.840
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage!</i>

18:02.440 --> 18:04.150
A root?

18:04.150 --> 18:07.860
That won't work on me!

18:09.060 --> 18:10.060
Got you!

18:32.200 --> 18:33.930
I-Impossible...

18:33.930 --> 18:34.930
Our guild master...

18:35.590 --> 18:42.970
<b>Demikas</b>

18:36.970 --> 18:39.270
His entire HP vanished in an instant?

18:39.990 --> 18:41.390
What did you do?

18:43.820 --> 18:45.820
Healers, heal!

18:45.820 --> 18:47.120
We can still—

18:48.980 --> 18:50.630
Crap...

18:56.410 --> 18:57.860
<i>A single attack</i>

18:57.860 --> 19:03.090
<i>from a swashbuckler could never 
defeat a level-90 monk.</i>

19:03.920 --> 19:07.310
<i>Even an assassin, which boasts 
the highest attack power</i>

19:07.310 --> 19:10.380
<i>among weapon-specialization 
classes, couldn't do that.</i>

19:11.520 --> 19:15.260
<i>Most likely, the secret lies in my lord's spell,</i>

19:15.830 --> 19:17.630
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage.</i>

19:18.220 --> 19:21.620
<i>Those shining thorns deal 1,000 
damage to the target</i>

19:21.620 --> 19:23.750
<i>for each hit by an ally.</i>

19:24.430 --> 19:27.270
<i>Destroying all five thorns does 5,000 damage.</i>

19:27.840 --> 19:30.150
<i>Even with the sword damage,</i>

19:30.580 --> 19:32.440
<i>that isn't enough to beat Demikas...</i>

19:32.950 --> 19:35.340
<i>Which probably means that...</i>

19:34.820 --> 19:36.440
<b>Monk, Lv. 90</b>

19:36.760 --> 19:39.780
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage has a

19:40.580 --> 19:44.490
<i>The swashbuckler waited fourteen 
seconds to begin his attack.</i>

19:44.880 --> 19:46.080
<i>He hit nine times.</i>

19:46.630 --> 19:47.950
<i>First five...</i>

19:51.790 --> 19:55.300
<i>One attack takes .22 seconds.</i>

19:55.870 --> 19:59.010
<i>And after he destroyed the fifth,</i>

19:59.810 --> 20:02.650
<i>my lord recast the thorns.</i>

20:03.470 --> 20:05.720
<i>And then he cut four...</i>

20:07.470 --> 20:09.100
<i>I didn't see it clearly.</i>

20:10.200 --> 20:12.900
<i>But that's the only explanation.</i>

20:13.460 --> 20:17.360
<i>But is it really possible?</i>

20:18.060 --> 20:20.910
<i>That must be why Naotsugu 
used Castle of Stone.</i>

20:20.910 --> 20:23.160
<i>He knew this was their plan.</i>

20:24.090 --> 20:28.790
<i>For them to work together that way, 
without coordinating ahead of time...</i>

20:30.280 --> 20:33.660
<i>I could not do that...</i>

20:35.080 --> 20:37.190
Put away your swords!

20:40.740 --> 20:44.030
We came through the Depths of Palm.

20:45.560 --> 20:50.010
Akihabara and this city are no longer so far 
apart as to prevent travel between them.

20:51.390 --> 20:54.400
You're finished causing this kind of trouble!

20:54.890 --> 20:56.700
We've won this battle.

20:57.570 --> 21:01.230
Or do you still want to fight, Demikas?

21:02.730 --> 21:04.020
Shut your mouth...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.930
I'm sending you all to the Cathedral.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.370
Over and over again...

21:10.850 --> 21:13.540
Until you break!

21:13.730 --> 21:15.680
Stop!

21:21.780 --> 21:24.350
Seems you're the one taking a trip to the Cathedral.

21:24.510 --> 21:27.300
<b>Shiroe/ Adventurer</b>

21:29.620 --> 21:32.120
I won't forget your face!

21:48.340 --> 21:50.980
Serara, you're coming, right?

21:53.850 --> 21:54.740
Akatsuki!

21:56.730 --> 21:57.580
Let's go.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.360
Time to take off!

22:07.680 --> 22:09.530
We're getting out of here!

22:16.470 --> 22:17.260
My lord...

22:17.730 --> 22:19.230
What is it, Akatsuki?

22:23.580 --> 22:24.810
Nothing.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.670
Let's go home.

22:28.820 --> 22:29.990
To Akihabara.

22:30.980 --> 22:31.840
Yeah.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.100
On their way back to Akihabara,

24:07.100 --> 24:09.350
Shiroe and his friends enjoy a moment of peace.

24:09.350 --> 24:12.110
And then Nyanta reveals a shocking truth.

24:12.110 --> 24:16.770
A secret about this world that will change 
everything they thought they knew.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.680
Meanwhile, young children 
are spending their days

24:20.680 --> 24:23.020
amidst endless despair in Akihabara.

24:23.020 --> 24:25.210
Next time: Return to Akihabara.

24:23.020 --> 24:29.990
<b>Return to Akihabara</b>

24:25.210 --> 24:26.690
This is our reality.
