WEBVTT

00:03.375 --> 00:06.000
Now, don't forget, everyone,
Wednesday night is Teddy's birthday

00:06.083 --> 00:08.000
and we're gonna have cake and ice cream.

00:08.083 --> 00:10.250
- Woo-whoo!
- Yay!

00:11.959 --> 00:13.542
Oh, man, I never know what to get you.

00:13.625 --> 00:14.959
Just get me a gift card.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.417
Oh, gift cards.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.750
When you care enough to do the very least.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.250
Eighteen, huh?

00:21.333 --> 00:23.208
You know, in some cultures,
this is when you'd stop

00:23.291 --> 00:24.750
being supported by your parents.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.959
Then how do they get their money?
From their grandparents?

00:30.291 --> 00:33.041
Oh, by the way, Dad,
I need 20 bucks for Teddy's gift card.

00:33.125 --> 00:34.166
Oh, me too.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.667
You know, guys, it's kind of not special

00:37.750 --> 00:40.625
when you're telling me
how much I'm getting right in front of me.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
And also, can it be 30?

00:45.041 --> 00:46.792
Can I have money too, Daddy?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.250
Oh, they grow up so fast.

- Hey, you.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.875
Oh! Sorry.

01:52.959 --> 01:55.166
Sorry! Do I still smell like skunk?

01:57.417 --> 01:58.667
No, it's not that.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.834
I just, I haven't told my
dad that we're dating yet.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.250
And a little.

02:06.208 --> 02:09.417
Well, when are you gonna tell him?
I want to tell the world.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.333
If I was back home, I'd have your name
on the water tower by now.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.250
A water tower? That, that sounds serious.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.458
Oh, it is.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.500
Especially if you get caught
by deputy Jim Bob.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.000
Anyways, when are you gonna tell him?

02:25.125 --> 02:26.834
Yeah, it seems like your dad likes me.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.250
Well, yeah, I just... I don't know.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.583
I've never dated anyone
that works for him before.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.834
That's good news.

02:32.417 --> 02:34.750
I've seen some pictures of Vern.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.667
Okay. I'm gonna tell him.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.667
I just want to make sure
that he's in a good mood when I do it.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.417
Main menu, billing!

02:46.583 --> 02:48.208
Bill-ing!

02:49.917 --> 02:51.083
Billing!

02:54.208 --> 02:55.959
And now's not that time.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.250
Gabe Duncan, you are going.

03:02.375 --> 03:04.208
No, I'm not, and you can't make me.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.250
Bob, talk to your son.

03:05.375 --> 03:08.583
Oh, if you can't make me go,
what are the odds that he can?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.834
He refuses to go clothes shopping with me.

03:13.917 --> 03:17.333
- And what's so bad about it?
- It's embarrassing.

03:17.458 --> 03:21.041
You're always spinning me around,
tucking things in, saying things like,

03:21.125 --> 03:23.250
"Is that too tight in the crotch?"

03:25.166 --> 03:29.083
Sometimes I say "crotch"
just to see that look on your face.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.959
If I have to go shopping,
can dad at least take me?

03:34.375 --> 03:37.000
There, you see, he just wants
to spend time with his old man.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.208
Don't get a big head.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.917
You're just the lesser of two evils.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.667
Before turning on your mixers,

03:48.750 --> 03:51.917
please make sure
they're on the proper settings, or...

03:57.542 --> 03:59.166
That will happen.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.709
I'm sorry, Chef.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.583
As usual, Potty,

04:02.667 --> 04:06.542
thank you for being
the "don't" part of our lesson.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.542
Winnie, what's going on with him?
He's meaner than usual.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.000
I don't know.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.125
Class, I have an announcement to make.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.542
The Wainwright Academy of Culinary
and Kitchen Operations...

04:21.875 --> 04:23.375
has been bought out.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.500
We are now owned
by the Sakashimi Institute

04:28.041 --> 04:30.333
of Culinary and Kitchen Operations.

04:30.542 --> 04:31.959
Therefore, from now on...

04:32.667 --> 04:36.792
WACKO will be known as SICKO.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.208
Oh, maybe that's what's stressing him out.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.667
Oh, it's stressing me out too.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.542
I just finished memorizing WACKO.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.917
So we're having cake and stuff
on my actual birthday.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.834
And then on Saturday,
Ivy's throwing me a surprise party.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.375
If it's a surprise,
how do you know about it?

04:57.458 --> 05:01.333
She invited me over Saturday night
for a study date,

05:01.750 --> 05:03.125
and then she giggled.

05:04.875 --> 05:08.500
So, uh, Spencer, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.542
My dad hired this new--

05:11.959 --> 05:13.458
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hey, Ted.

05:13.542 --> 05:14.667
Hi, Mr. Duncan.

05:14.750 --> 05:15.792
Oh, hey, Spence.

05:16.333 --> 05:19.041
- So you were telling me something?
- Oh, it can wait.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.458
Hey, Spencer,

05:21.041 --> 05:22.625
you remember that itch I had?

05:22.709 --> 05:24.208
The one I kept scratching in front of you?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.667
Burned into my brain, sir.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.542
Yeah, well, you won't ever see that again,

05:28.625 --> 05:31.125
because I went to the doctor
and got me some ointment.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.834
Or was it a salve?

05:36.792 --> 05:38.041
Amy!

05:38.125 --> 05:40.250
My butt stuff, what is that called?

05:40.375 --> 05:41.458
Talk to you later.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.250
Charlie, honey, your lunch is ready.

05:53.375 --> 05:56.208
- What's this?
- It's Teddy's birthday present.

05:57.125 --> 06:00.417
- You got her a rock?
- She doesn't have one.

06:02.542 --> 06:03.917
Well, that's true.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Um, you know what else Teddy might like?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.208
A little necklace.

06:08.291 --> 06:13.250
Like maybe you could make one with some
string, and macaroni, some glitter.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.083
Sounds like a lot of work.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.333
I'm sure whatever you get Teddy
she will love.

06:20.917 --> 06:26.583
Um, also, uh, just so you know,
for Mother's Day, I already have a rock.

06:29.875 --> 06:30.834
Amy: Hey.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.625
- How'd it go at the Mall?
- Fine, yeah.

06:34.542 --> 06:35.792
Tell her about your shirt.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.333
Dad picked out a shirt for me.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.041
Tell her what you said about it.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.917
I said it was cool.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.667
Don't go crazy about this.
You just didn't fail.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.667
When we were paying for our stuff,

06:50.250 --> 06:53.166
the sales clerk said,
"That's a nice shirt.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.834
You must be one of those cool, hip dads."

06:57.583 --> 07:00.125
Really? She said that?

07:00.834 --> 07:01.875
She said, "nice shirt".

07:02.458 --> 07:03.709
I kind of made up the rest.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.500
Did she even say, "nice shirt"?

07:07.166 --> 07:08.000
Nope.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.667
Chef, what are you doing here?

07:20.083 --> 07:21.291
I was in the neighborhood,

07:21.375 --> 07:24.125
and I thought I'd pay a visit
to my favorite student.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.166
Oh, does he live around here?

07:28.166 --> 07:29.250
It's you.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.291
- May I come in?
- Sure.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.291
- And who's this?
- This is my brother, Toby.

07:35.667 --> 07:36.959
Toby, Chef.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.000
What a charming little tyke.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.250
So what can I do for you, Chef?

07:43.333 --> 07:45.542
What, do I have to want something
to pay you a visit?

07:46.417 --> 07:49.208
PJ, I see something in you.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.542
You remind me of a young me.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.125
Wouldn't that be more
like three young yous?

07:57.959 --> 08:02.208
Marvelous, because I'm so large
and you're so slight.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.542
Actually, there is one thing.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.959
Um, the corporation that I now report to,

08:11.041 --> 08:15.208
has randomly selected one of my students
to do a teacher evaluation.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.208
And that student is you.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.792
An evaluation? That sounds complicated.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.333
It's simple, really.

08:24.375 --> 08:29.625
There's a numbering system
where one is poor and five is excellent.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.792
The important thing to remember
is that five is excellent.

08:34.834 --> 08:35.667
Got it.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.458
Do you? Let's review.

08:38.834 --> 08:39.959
What is excellent?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.166
- Five.
- Very good.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.458
Very good would be four.

08:42.959 --> 08:44.875
- No, I meant you did fine.
- Fine is three, right?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.375
I'm going to leave now.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.125
What? A gift card?

08:58.208 --> 08:59.917
No way!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.208
Yeah, honey, save it
for the surprise party.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.917
Fifteen dollars? Gabe, I gave you 20.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.709
What? The gift-giver
can't get a little taste?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.458
Open my present.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.333
Okay.

09:13.417 --> 09:14.792
Oh! It's heavy.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.125
Oh.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
It's a rock.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.834
Oh.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.834
That must be Beau. I invited him over.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.458
Beau? Why?

09:26.917 --> 09:28.166
Oh, well, you know.

09:28.250 --> 09:32.250
Just... because he doesn't really know
anybody in town.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.333
And he's such a sweet guy.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.000
No other reason.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.125
Happy birthday!

09:41.500 --> 09:42.875
- Spencer.
- Hey.

09:42.959 --> 09:44.375
Hey, Spencer.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.667
Hey, everybody.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.041
Um What a great surprise.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.083
Um, what are you doing here?

09:51.166 --> 09:53.417
Oh, come on, you really think
I'd miss your 18th birthday?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.458
I flew in this morning.

09:55.959 --> 09:56.959
Hello?

09:57.625 --> 09:58.709
Beau's here.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.333
Hey, everybody.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.917
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thanks.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.083
Who's the guy with the smaller bouquet?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.166
Who's the guy with the cheaper flowers?

10:12.250 --> 10:15.000
I guess I should probably
introduce you two.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.583
Unless there's another option.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.125
No? Okay.

10:20.208 --> 10:24.709
Um, Beau, this is Spencer.
My ex-boyfriend.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.625
And, Spencer, this is Beau.

10:27.709 --> 10:30.166
He works for my dad.

10:32.875 --> 10:34.250
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.250
- What's he doing here?
- What's he doing here?

10:37.750 --> 10:39.667
All right, now before I answer
those questions,

10:40.166 --> 10:43.375
let me just remind everybody,
especially Dad...

10:44.458 --> 10:46.250
That it's my birthday.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.375
Happy, happy, happy.

10:49.041 --> 10:49.875
Here goes.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.417
Beau and I are dating.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.959
- You're dating?
- You're dating?

10:57.583 --> 11:01.709
♪ Happy Birthday to you, Happy-- ♪

11:05.875 --> 11:07.291
What, did you guys forget the words?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.667
You're dating my employee?

11:16.750 --> 11:17.709
Wait a minute.

11:17.792 --> 11:18.792
Let me rephrase that.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.625
You're dating my daughter?

11:22.625 --> 11:25.333
Okay, now, Bob's up to speed.

11:25.834 --> 11:29.750
Why don't we go have cake in the kitchen
and give these three some space?

11:29.834 --> 11:32.625
Are you kidding me?
This party just got interesting.

11:32.709 --> 11:34.125
Kitchen! Now!

11:38.291 --> 11:42.375
Spencer, I was gonna tell you about Beau
the other day, but then my dad walked in,

11:42.458 --> 11:44.667
and, well, you know,
I just didn't have a chance.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.625
No problem, Teddy. I'm happy for you.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.709
- Really?
- Yeah, you're a lucky guy.

11:50.959 --> 11:51.917
I agree.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.834
Of course Mr. Duncan's probably gonna want
a follow-up conversation.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.250
Bob: You got that right!

12:04.583 --> 12:06.250
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hi, Gabe.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
- What are you looking at?
- Your shirt.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.542
- Oh, do you like it?
- Yeah.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.834
I have it in red.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.667
What?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.792
You're wearing a girl's shirt.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.250
No, I'm not.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.792
Yes, you are.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.792
Look at the buttons.
They're on the left side.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.375
So? That doesn't prove anything.

12:36.917 --> 12:40.333
Okay, Kelly, a mistake has been made.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.375
But if you have an ounce of decency,
please, I beg you...

12:43.458 --> 12:45.250
Hey, everybody!

12:45.375 --> 12:48.083
Gabe Duncan's wearing a girl's shirt.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.792
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay!

12:52.875 --> 12:55.375
Guys, I don't have to stand here
and take this.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.166
I should be running.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.083
Spencer, hey.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.041
- Hey, can we talk for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.542
So, what's going on?

13:13.750 --> 13:14.834
Um...

13:17.792 --> 13:22.959
The truth is, uh, it felt really weird
to see you with another guy.

13:23.709 --> 13:27.166
You know, I thought I'd be okay with it,
but I'm not.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.959
But don't you have a girlfriend?

13:30.041 --> 13:31.417
Oh, we broke up weeks ago.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.083
Teddy, when I saw you with him, I...

13:35.291 --> 13:37.417
realized that I still have feelings
for you.

13:38.041 --> 13:39.125
Um...

13:40.291 --> 13:41.500
What are you saying?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.458
I think we should get back together.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.375
Ah, Spencer, I...

13:45.458 --> 13:47.375
What, don't you still have
feelings for me?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.458
- Of course I do.
- Then we should be together.

13:49.542 --> 13:52.291
But I also have feelings for Beau.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.500
I saw you first.

13:59.709 --> 14:01.667
I don't really think that applies here.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.792
You're just gonna have
to decide, you know?

14:06.458 --> 14:07.792
Who do you want to be with; Me or him?

14:07.875 --> 14:09.709
Spencer, that's not fair.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.667
You can't just spring this on me

14:12.750 --> 14:14.875
and expect me to make
some sort of big decision.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.208
Okay, you're right.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.959
I'm sorry. Just, um...

14:20.041 --> 14:22.125
You know, think about it.
Take all the time you want.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.166
Thank you.

14:24.417 --> 14:25.625
Have you decided yet?

14:34.250 --> 14:36.166
- Oh, my.
- That bad, huh?

14:36.291 --> 14:37.375
Quite the opposite.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Chef, you know the opposite of bad
is good, right?

14:42.375 --> 14:44.834
There's that wit.

14:46.500 --> 14:51.083
PJ, this sauce is truly astonishing.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.542
Wow.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.000
By the way, how are we doing
with that evaluation?

14:55.083 --> 14:56.583
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot it.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.458
- I'll bring it in tomorrow.
- Wonderful.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.917
Evaluation? What was that all about?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.208
The people at SICKO want me
to evaluate Chef.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.583
Oh, that's it.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.041
That's why he's being nice to you.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.291
- PJ, don't you get it?
- Oh, of course.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.750
Of course I do. Yeah.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.917
But if you want to review it
for your own sake, that's fine with me.

15:21.667 --> 15:26.166
Chef is being nice to you
so you'll give him a good evaluation.

15:26.250 --> 15:30.458
And until you hand it in,
he'll love everything you do.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.375
There is a simpler explanation.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.417
- What's that?
- Maybe my sauce truly is astonishing.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.625
No, that's not it.
What was your thing again?

15:47.583 --> 15:51.792
And then, he said
he still has feelings for me.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.667
Oh.

15:55.667 --> 15:59.500
And he wants me to choose
between the two of you.

16:01.542 --> 16:02.583
Oh.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.083
Is that all you're gonna say? "Oh"?

16:06.542 --> 16:09.041
Um... Oh, my?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.792
Beau, be serious.

16:14.834 --> 16:18.041
Look, Teddy.
Obviously, I want you to choose me.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.709
But I get that you and Spencer
have had a long history together.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.417
Whatever you decide, I'll understand.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.291
I just want you to be happy.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.875
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.875
Although, I kind of wish
this whole thing had come up

16:35.959 --> 16:38.333
before me and your dad
had that five-hour conversation.

16:44.917 --> 16:45.959
Oh, hey, buddy.

16:46.917 --> 16:47.834
So?

16:48.709 --> 16:50.583
Everyone at school like your new shirt?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.667
Well, yeah, Dad.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.750
The girls did.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.834
- Ooh, I bet they did.
- Yeah.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.500
That's because it's a girl's shirt!

17:04.166 --> 17:05.667
What? No, it's not.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.333
Yes, it is.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.792
Girls are wearing it.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.750
It's not a shirt. It's a top.

17:12.542 --> 17:15.166
You sent me to school in a top!

17:17.166 --> 17:19.875
Oh, man, I must have wandered
into the girls' section.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.166
Oops.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.667
"Oops"?
That's all you have to say is "oops"?

17:26.750 --> 17:27.750
Dad, everybody laughed.

17:27.834 --> 17:28.917
I was humiliated.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.208
All right, all right.
All right, Gabe, Gabe. I'm sorry.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.834
Why do you care so much
about what other people think?

17:33.917 --> 17:35.959
Oh, because I'm in Middle School.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.709
That's what we do in Middle School!

17:39.208 --> 17:42.667
Well, someday, you're gonna realize
it doesn't matter what other people think.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.500
If you like a shirt,
you should be proud to wear it.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.750
So you would wear a girl's shirt?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.583
If I liked it, yes.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.709
Get your keys. We're going shopping.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.709
So, have you had time
to think about what a great guy I am?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.125
Um, you are a great guy.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.333
And, um...

18:12.458 --> 18:18.000
So I'm not saying
that It could never work between us.

18:19.375 --> 18:20.583
But, um...

18:22.625 --> 18:24.709
Now is just not the time.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Oh.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.959
I mean, you're on the other side
of the country.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.917
And I'm going to college soon. It just...

18:35.750 --> 18:38.709
You know? It like...
It feels like we're in different places.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.542
Hmm.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.291
Is there anything I can say
to change your mind?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.750
No, I don't think so, Spence.

18:49.041 --> 18:52.125
I just... you know, I really hope
this doesn't change anything between us.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.417
Because our friendship
is so important to me.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.959
I'm sorry, Teddy. I can't.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.083
You can't what?

18:57.166 --> 18:58.333
Be friends with you.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.125
- Why?
- Because it's too hard.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.083
Teddy, I'm still in love with you.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.000
Are you okay, Teddy?

19:23.625 --> 19:25.792
- Were you listening?
- No.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.208
You handled it really well, though.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.834
- Morning, Chef.
- Good morning, friend.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.125
I made this quiche last night.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.041
- Can I get your opinion?
- With pleasure.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.834
Oh, it's so... quichey.

19:59.291 --> 20:02.625
It's like my mouth has been taken
to flavor town.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.208
Wrong.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.291
- Excuse me?
- I know it's bad.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.542
My mom made it.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.208
Here is your evaluation.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.291
You can stop being nice to me now.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.959
- All fives?
- Yes, because you're a great teacher.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.667
When you're being you.

20:19.750 --> 20:23.917
The truth is, Chef, I'd rather have a mean
teacher I can learn from.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.375
Than a nice teacher who's only being nice
because he's nice for the sake of...

20:30.417 --> 20:31.333
Let me start over.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.375
- The truth is, Chef--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.667
I... I think I know
what you're trying to say.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.333
You'd prefer it if I told you the truth.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.709
- That this quiche is horrid.
- Yes.

20:40.792 --> 20:41.792
- Rancid!
- Good.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.750
Putrid, disgusting, glop!

20:43.834 --> 20:45.750
- Well, that was a little much.
- Get out.

20:45.834 --> 20:46.959
And he's back.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.917
Well, Charlie, I turned 18.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.625
It was a pretty big milestone.

20:56.709 --> 20:58.041
I'm a legal adult.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.250
I can vote now.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.041
Uh, excuse me. Uh...

21:01.125 --> 21:02.750
No, you are revealing your ignorance.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.583
You cannot vote until you're 25.

21:06.542 --> 21:07.583
Dad told me.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.125
- Oh.
- Yeah.

21:11.208 --> 21:12.208
- You're right.
- Mm-hm.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.458
- My bad.
- I know.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.458
Teddy: Whoa!

21:18.583 --> 21:21.709
Dad, what are you wearing?

21:22.750 --> 21:24.458
Something I'm very comfortable in.

21:25.834 --> 21:29.750
And something that I think expresses
my unique flair and style.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.542
Dad agreed to wear it for 24 hours.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.834
I know you're trying to embarrass me,
but it ain't gonna work.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.000
You do know it's bowling night, right?

21:43.417 --> 21:44.959
Oh, boy.

21:48.208 --> 21:51.375
Ooh, better wish dad
some good luck, Charlie.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.375
Hello, friends.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.542
I'm Bob Duncan.

21:58.625 --> 21:59.834
And I have a question for you.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.792
How many times has this happened to you?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.875
This itch is driving me crazy!

22:10.041 --> 22:11.083
Well, no more!

22:11.625 --> 22:13.834
Because now,
science has given us a solution.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.166
Bob's Butt Stuff.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.375
Is it a cream? Is it a salve?

22:19.875 --> 22:21.166
Can you grout your tub with it?

22:21.250 --> 22:23.542
The answer, of course, is yes.

22:25.166 --> 22:29.000
Bob's Butt Stuff, available in the most
embarrassing section of your drugstore.
