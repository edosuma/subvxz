Pwera usog. Pwera usog.
(keep evil eye hex away)

00:15.842 --> 00:17.759
Oh, use this.

00:18.859 --> 00:20.442
Be careful next time.

00:20.751 --> 00:21.809
Thank you.

00:22.125 --> 00:25.167
Say goodbye to Ms. Minda so we can go now.

00:29.042 --> 00:31.501
Sorry, she's just really shy.

00:31.942 --> 00:34.484
Don't you want to have a child of your own?

00:35.542 --> 00:38.918
Oh, please. I don't even have a husband,
what more having a child.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.667
Then just get pregnant.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.626
You're crazy! Go now. You take care, okay?

00:44.876 --> 00:46.318
-I'll go ahead.
-Okay.

01:02.184 --> 01:04.476
Miss! Miss! Help me!

01:05.459 --> 01:07.334
-What is it?
-It's my friend!

01:07.542 --> 01:09.250
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.584
You live in that house?

01:20.042 --> 01:21.918
That's long been abandoned.

01:22.584 --> 01:25.876
Please help my friend.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.584
What happened to her?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.792
She's been acting like this.

01:44.292 --> 01:45.325
Little girl...

01:46.209 --> 01:47.667
What are you doing?

01:55.959 --> 01:58.083
She said she's going to look over us.

01:58.834 --> 01:59.892
Who?

02:34.516 --> 02:35.916
Her.

03:01.042 --> 03:03.125
-What about her?!
-Let's go!

03:04.209 --> 03:05.250
I said let's go!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.375
Let's go!

03:14.292 --> 03:15.501
What happened?!

03:16.751 --> 03:18.125
It was an evil eye hex!

03:18.334 --> 03:19.409
By who?!

03:19.417 --> 03:20.834
It was a little girl.

03:21.042 --> 03:22.417
She's my friend.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.918
What?! A kid did this?!

03:26.417 --> 03:28.100
Has your spirit force weakened?

03:28.209 --> 03:29.234
Minda!

03:30.292 --> 03:31.375
Oh, My God!

03:41.375 --> 03:47.584
(chant)

03:47.792 --> 03:49.751
Pwera usog! Pwera usog!

03:50.042 --> 03:52.417
Pwera usog! Pwera usog!

04:07.809 --> 04:09.934
I don't think this is done by a child.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.167
Not a child!

04:18.416 --> 04:19.875
Luna!

07:13.334 --> 07:14.392
Alright!

07:16.826 --> 07:18.283
Miss...

07:19.042 --> 07:21.209
Oh, my God! What happened to you?!

07:21.417 --> 07:24.000
-My back...
-Your back?!

07:25.918 --> 07:27.000
My God!

07:27.918 --> 07:30.459
Miss, save yourself!

07:31.083 --> 07:32.626
Run!

07:43.250 --> 07:44.834
She's gone.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.459
She left her groceries here.

07:51.967 --> 07:53.383
Oh my!

07:53.592 --> 07:56.542
It's really funny how she ran!
Do you want to see it?

07:56.751 --> 07:57.751
Let me see.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.926
Can you help me get up here first?

08:01.318 --> 08:02.584
No way, girl.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.609
-I don't want to hold your hands.
-You, witch.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.775
Oh, we already got 5 victims.
Maybe we should go now?

08:08.584 --> 08:10.118
Yeah. What do we do now?

08:11.076 --> 08:13.867
Let's go to our house and
get some drinks while we edit.

08:14.259 --> 08:15.692
Is that okay to your dad?

08:15.901 --> 08:17.959
He'll be home from Honolulu next week.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.942
I'm alone in the house.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.151
So... let's go?

08:22.692 --> 08:24.192
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

08:27.442 --> 08:29.359
Bobby, can you take this off?

08:30.525 --> 08:32.883
You do it, Val!
Anyway, you're not doing anything here.

08:33.650 --> 08:34.734
She's just taking videos.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.491
-Go ahead.
-Wow!

08:36.515 --> 08:37.566
Go, go, go.

08:37.567 --> 08:38.751
Ewww!

08:38.942 --> 08:40.409
Don't be stagy, come on!

08:52.942 --> 08:54.109
Who is it?

08:57.318 --> 08:58.501
Jean!

09:00.609 --> 09:01.818
Jean!

09:02.134 --> 09:03.384
Open the door!

09:08.200 --> 09:09.334
Wait up!

09:13.717 --> 09:17.550
Dad! Wow! I thought you'd be
in Honolulu for one week?

09:18.692 --> 09:21.318
I was in Guam, not Honolulu.

09:22.609 --> 09:23.942
What the hell took you so long?

09:24.400 --> 09:25.734
Have you been smoking?

09:26.151 --> 09:27.250
No!

09:28.400 --> 09:29.950
So Dad, how was your trip?

09:35.901 --> 09:37.384
Do you think this is funny?

09:38.008 --> 09:39.208
Huh?

09:43.567 --> 09:47.318
Dad, that's 50,000 views
in less than an hour.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.442
I don't care how many
people have seen this.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.984
What if one time,
the person you are pranking, has a gun?

09:55.650 --> 09:58.526
I think it will be better if I send you to
Nebraska with your grandfather.

09:58.642 --> 10:00.667
I don't wanna live in a
freakin' corn field, Dad!

10:00.775 --> 10:02.775
Well then, fix your goddamn life!

10:03.192 --> 10:04.301
Get dressed!

10:04.859 --> 10:06.692
I will enroll you in a university, go!

10:07.001 --> 10:08.083
No!

10:09.525 --> 10:10.942
If you don't listen to me,

10:11.525 --> 10:13.359
you won't get any allowance!

10:24.425 --> 10:26.218
So you think I can't live independently?

10:27.942 --> 10:29.400
I earn thousands, Dad.

10:30.026 --> 10:32.483
Thousands only from my videos.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.267
Why can't you just be like your brother.

10:37.942 --> 10:40.359
-He's got...
-He's got a scholarship to Oxford!

10:40.567 --> 10:44.609
Yes Dad, you've reminded me
about that countless times.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.026
But I am not Hilton, Dad.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.909
I'm not as intelligent as he is.

10:54.151 --> 10:55.567
I will never be like him.

10:57.442 --> 10:59.367
Because this is the only thing I'm good at.

11:00.859 --> 11:02.400
And, I know...

11:02.817 --> 11:04.318
People love me for it!

11:07.318 --> 11:09.359
Alright... let's see.

11:11.609 --> 11:12.783
Sunflower12.

11:13.142 --> 11:16.517
What the hell is her problem!
She's an attention seeker!

11:17.483 --> 11:19.442
I feel hopeless for this generation...

11:19.734 --> 11:25.990
- Bitch like Jean should be
tied up and burned alive! - Enough!

11:26.901 --> 11:27.925
Dad, enough...

11:29.026 --> 11:30.050
Please...

12:35.642 --> 12:37.550
Jean, you're drunk! It's time to go.

12:37.759 --> 12:38.767
No!

12:38.775 --> 12:39.842
Let's go!

12:55.926 --> 12:58.383
Jean, what's happening to you?

12:59.318 --> 13:01.692
Why do you care? You're just my ex!

13:03.034 --> 13:04.418
Why did you ask me to pick you up?

13:04.809 --> 13:06.226
Why not Val or Bobby?

13:10.101 --> 13:11.192
Hey...

13:12.259 --> 13:14.842
Am I a bad person?

13:18.942 --> 13:19.992
No.

13:20.267 --> 13:24.392
Then, why do they comment like that?

13:52.126 --> 13:53.175
Good evening, Sir.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.534
Have you been drinking?

13:54.742 --> 13:55.742
No, I did not.

13:56.409 --> 13:57.501
Well... not me.

13:58.476 --> 13:59.526
But Jean has.

13:59.759 --> 14:00.825
I knew it!

14:01.059 --> 14:02.109
Uncle.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.201
I think Jean has a problem.

14:09.818 --> 14:11.983
That's why she's acting like that lately.

14:13.109 --> 14:14.400
She lives in a nice house.

14:14.609 --> 14:16.234
She eats three times a day.

14:17.017 --> 14:19.767
And she has things other
kids cannot afford!

14:21.342 --> 14:23.634
Kids nowadays are so dramatic.

14:24.309 --> 14:25.375
Well anyway...

14:26.642 --> 14:29.017
Thank you for bringing her home safely.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.825
And I'm sorry you and Jean broke up.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.083
Among all of the boyfriends that she had,

14:35.518 --> 14:37.392
only you could have fixed her up.

14:40.683 --> 14:42.101
Faster, Bobby!

14:43.425 --> 14:45.425
Whoo!

14:55.434 --> 14:56.334
Guys!

14:56.392 --> 14:57.518
Look what I found.

14:58.101 --> 14:59.001
Hello, guys!

14:59.017 --> 15:01.809
We're going to do the black widow prank.

15:04.209 --> 15:05.692
- Let's go there!
- Go!

15:15.816 --> 15:17.316
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:30.725 --> 15:31.900
What the!

15:32.475 --> 15:34.567
What now? Letâ€™s get it.

15:36.975 --> 15:38.892
Sorry, we're really very sorry!

15:39.184 --> 15:42.226
Sorry? Look what you did?

15:46.059 --> 15:47.184
Boss, this is only a prank!

15:47.392 --> 15:48.451
Boss! Sorry!

15:48.559 --> 15:50.476
I don't care!

15:50.683 --> 15:52.101
Do you want to get arrested?!

15:52.351 --> 15:53.442
What?

15:56.509 --> 15:58.342
It's good that he took the money.

15:58.351 --> 16:01.101
Because if not, all of us will be
in the police station.

16:01.509 --> 16:02.718
Hassle!

16:03.067 --> 16:05.450
My Dad's gonna raise hell again!

16:06.067 --> 16:07.859
What's next, let's just call it the day?

16:08.275 --> 16:09.609
I don't wanna go home!

16:10.342 --> 16:11.342
Let's go on a road trip.

16:11.700 --> 16:12.459
We could do that.

16:12.551 --> 16:13.950
-Where?
-I don't know.

16:14.092 --> 16:16.718
Maybe... outside Metro Manila!

16:17.209 --> 16:18.283
I can't.

16:18.384 --> 16:19.800
I don't have my license.

16:20.367 --> 16:22.283
But if it's only here in
Manila, that'll be fine.

16:22.384 --> 16:25.876
I will just show them papa's ID and the
enforcers will leave us alone.

16:26.709 --> 16:27.792
I have an idea.

16:30.009 --> 16:31.676
I bet that's Sherwin.

16:33.551 --> 16:36.134
-Sherwin...
-I knew it!

16:38.958 --> 17:07.958
(singing)

17:33.592 --> 17:34.684
Where are we?

17:38.426 --> 17:39.592
Where are we?!

17:40.459 --> 17:43.125
I just explored 'till we reached here.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.183
It's amazing, right?

17:46.384 --> 17:48.925
Sherwin, make sure we can still go home.

17:52.267 --> 17:53.342
Here, eat up.

17:53.718 --> 17:55.183
I bought it on the way.

17:57.559 --> 17:58.683
I'm still full.

17:59.092 --> 18:00.176
You don't like it?

18:01.426 --> 18:02.492
Thank you.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.759
Maybe, I will just study.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.292
Just like what daddy said.

18:07.918 --> 18:09.067
That's good for me.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.676
Right? When I get to America,
I will run away.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.009
I will go to LA or New York.

18:15.384 --> 18:18.925
-Don't.
-Huh? Why?

18:19.667 --> 18:21.626
It's the perfect plan Sherwin.

18:25.542 --> 18:26.651
What about me?

18:30.617 --> 18:31.826
You?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.542
Miss, can I ask for pennies?

18:41.042 --> 18:42.667
So we can buy food.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.684
Mister, thank you!

18:55.925 --> 18:59.259
-Thank you!
-It's okay... Thank you! Stop it! Go away!

19:05.083 --> 19:06.334
Go away!

19:18.592 --> 19:21.800
Where have you been? We thought
you've been massacred or something.

19:22.301 --> 19:23.967
No, we just roamed around.

19:25.175 --> 19:26.459
You just roamed around? Really?

19:26.467 --> 19:28.651
- Tell us the truth! Come on!
- Say it! Nice one, bro!

19:28.759 --> 19:29.818
Shut up, bro...

19:30.225 --> 19:31.601
Wow... shut up.

19:31.759 --> 19:33.517
Anyway, what are we going to do here?

19:33.826 --> 19:34.951
I have an idea.

19:35.559 --> 19:37.976
We encountered a beggar awhile ago.

19:38.601 --> 19:39.850
So?

19:40.701 --> 19:42.076
I wanna help her!

19:42.483 --> 19:43.909
Wait, I don't get it.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.792
I will give her money.
Five thousand.

19:48.392 --> 19:52.684
While I'm giving this to her, I want you
to get it on video.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.259
-Okay.
-Wait, for what?

19:56.909 --> 19:59.175
So that my bashers will stop.

19:59.684 --> 20:02.459
And you think your dad's gonna be
pleased just because of that?

20:04.259 --> 20:09.234
Or maybe, we can make it more fun so it could
go viral. I've watched this prank in US.

20:09.851 --> 20:12.737
They pranked this pizza delivery guy.
The delivery

20:12.862 --> 20:15.824
guy thought they're
really going to kill him.

20:16.050 --> 20:18.676
Yes, I saw that. He didn't know
they will just give him a big tip.

20:18.883 --> 20:20.718
-He even cried, right?
-Yup!

20:21.425 --> 20:24.175
You guys are so good,
that's why you're a perfect match.

20:24.284 --> 20:25.167
I know.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.751
Are you guys serious?

20:27.167 --> 20:28.626
You're going to prank the beggar?

20:29.209 --> 20:30.326
Why?

20:30.534 --> 20:33.034
Bro, it's going to be funny, relax!

20:33.442 --> 20:34.542
- Right.
-Jean?

20:35.200 --> 20:39.375
Our objective here is to help the beggar.
Anyway, we are giving her money!

20:39.909 --> 20:41.483
But why do you need to prank her.

20:44.425 --> 20:45.509
You know what,

20:46.183 --> 20:47.734
it's up to you, but I am out!

20:48.426 --> 20:49.718
Oh guys, he is out!

20:49.925 --> 20:52.217
-You know, your ex is such a buzzkill!
-I know right.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.467
Anyway, enough of that.
What are we going to do?

21:00.175 --> 21:02.384
Jean...Jean!

21:03.718 --> 21:06.301
-Are you sure you saw her here?
-I'm sure, Bobby.

21:06.959 --> 21:09.959
-Where the hell is she!
-Maybe she's at the higher floor.

21:10.367 --> 21:11.826
Higher floor?

21:19.876 --> 21:20.918
Is that her?

21:21.783 --> 21:23.375
This is what we're going to do.

21:23.684 --> 21:26.702
I'll sneak up on her, I'll scare her.
I will make her believe that

21:26.827 --> 21:28.491
I am a serial killer.

21:28.976 --> 21:30.475
And we frighten her.

21:30.976 --> 21:32.925
I am sure she will run in fear.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.509
I will make her believe that
we are really going to kill her.

21:35.718 --> 21:40.967
And then, to make her calm down, let's take
this off. Then give her the 5,000 pesos.

21:41.475 --> 21:43.517
Okay?
Clear.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.759
I will kill you!

22:42.676 --> 22:47.301
-I will kill you! You're dead!
-I will kill you!

22:48.759 --> 22:50.426
That's enough, tell her it's a prank.

22:50.634 --> 22:53.459
Let's just chase her outside the rooftop, then
that's when I'll reveal myself! Come on, Bobby!

22:53.467 --> 22:56.259
-Have pitty on her!
-Bobby, she's getting away!

22:57.676 --> 23:01.676
I will break your head until
your brain comes out!

23:13.467 --> 23:14.601
Miss...

23:16.767 --> 23:18.100
Miss!

23:20.450 --> 23:22.617
Miss, we're not going to harm you.

23:31.425 --> 23:32.592
Miss!

23:40.167 --> 23:41.250
Miss!

23:44.176 --> 23:45.967
Miss, calm down.

23:47.934 --> 23:49.117
Miss, calm down!

23:50.126 --> 23:52.417
We are here to help you.

23:53.126 --> 23:55.418
I'll give you 5,000 pesos.

23:57.959 --> 24:00.875
Take it.
Come on, take it.

24:22.350 --> 24:23.767
Miss, please stop.

24:23.976 --> 24:25.001
Miss!

24:25.475 --> 24:26.601
Miss!

24:27.575 --> 24:28.701
Listen to me!

24:29.759 --> 24:30.967
Miss!

24:31.292 --> 24:32.292
Oh, my God!

24:32.401 --> 24:33.726
You're going to fall! Oh, my God!

24:33.759 --> 24:36.718
Please, listen to me!
You're going to fall!

24:38.384 --> 24:39.384
Oh, my Gosh...

24:42.708 --> 24:43.808
Fuck!

24:52.483 --> 24:53.600
Where is she!

24:54.142 --> 24:56.559
We were up there!
She should be here!

24:56.909 --> 24:59.434
You know I already have a bad feeling
about this! But still you won't stop!

24:59.742 --> 25:01.159
So you are saying it's my fault?

25:01.367 --> 25:02.675
Whose idea is this prank, anyway?!

25:02.742 --> 25:03.300
Val!

25:03.367 --> 25:05.076
Wow!
Wow Jean, wow!

25:05.283 --> 25:07.409
You planned to prank her, what the heck!

25:07.617 --> 25:10.650
I just wanted to give her the money, and
you suggested it to make it viral!

25:10.659 --> 25:12.118
-To be funny, right?
-Whatever!

25:12.325 --> 25:13.359
What happened?

25:14.951 --> 25:16.118
Did you see the beggar?

25:17.076 --> 25:18.400
She's with you guys upstairs.

25:18.409 --> 25:19.701
She fell off the building!

25:19.909 --> 25:21.867
Huh? You guys pushed her?

25:22.076 --> 25:23.659
Why would we push her, Sherwin!

25:24.076 --> 25:26.909
She fell off by accident!
So she should have been here!

25:27.118 --> 25:30.325
You ought the shit doesn't add up,
we need to go now! Let's go!

25:33.300 --> 25:35.017
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Sherwin!

25:36.659 --> 25:38.034
Maybe she survived.

25:38.442 --> 25:41.859
And so if she did, she
ran away that easily?

25:42.625 --> 25:45.867
-Come on, Sherwin!
-Well, that's the only logical explanation.

25:48.826 --> 25:49.917
That's stupid.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.659
Give me a second, guys.
I will be right back.

26:05.442 --> 26:07.067
I'll just buy some cigarettes.

26:14.559 --> 26:16.101
Can I borrow the camera?

26:16.642 --> 26:18.001
-Why?
-Let me see!

26:36.167 --> 26:37.875
Miss, calm down.

26:39.784 --> 26:41.509
Miss, calm down!

26:42.034 --> 26:44.242
We are here to help you!

26:49.834 --> 26:52.376
Take it! Come on.
Take it.

26:53.951 --> 26:56.283
Val! Stop moving!

26:59.207 --> 27:03.707
(scream)

27:13.231 --> 27:15.631
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

27:22.525 --> 27:23.951
Sherwin, she was just right there!

27:24.059 --> 27:24.759
Who?

27:24.867 --> 27:25.659
The beggar!

27:25.951 --> 27:26.659
She's alive!

27:26.909 --> 27:29.167
-Are you sure, guys?
-Yes, we are!

27:30.001 --> 27:30.850
What happened?

27:30.959 --> 27:32.409
They saw the beggar.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.709
Jean and I swear it was really her!

27:36.251 --> 27:37.767
So, we don't have any problem!

27:38.076 --> 27:39.450
But how did she get here?

27:41.209 --> 27:43.209
She's homeless, I'm sure she loiters.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.759
God, Bobby, up to here?

27:45.334 --> 27:47.917
Can we just go home already... please!

27:59.667 --> 28:03.459
Are you serious? After what had happened?

28:05.526 --> 28:07.142
Nothing happened!

28:07.334 --> 28:09.834
Sherwin... she's fine!

28:11.034 --> 28:13.259
I just don't want to waste the footage.

28:13.875 --> 28:17.209
You'll show everything you did to her?

28:18.533 --> 28:19.533
Uhm...

28:19.625 --> 28:20.583
Jean...

28:20.792 --> 28:23.292
Maybe just the part where
I gave her the money.

28:26.909 --> 28:28.367
Where are you starting?

28:30.759 --> 28:34.592
- There. -"I'll give you 5000 pesos"
-So where are you going to finish it?

28:38.201 --> 28:39.250
Here.

28:41.301 --> 28:43.384
Take it, come on.
Take it.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.802
Maybe it's better if I
make an opening spiel

28:48.727 --> 28:52.591
so that people will
understand the context.

28:55.459 --> 28:56.509
Here...

28:58.651 --> 28:59.950
Come on, Sherwin.

29:08.174 --> 29:09.374
Okay...

29:11.534 --> 29:14.517
Zoom it in up to my chest only.

29:16.918 --> 29:17.925
Okay.

29:17.949 --> 29:19.025
Rolling.

29:19.226 --> 29:20.101
Hi, guys!

29:20.209 --> 29:23.792
For this episode, instead of
staging an elaborate prank.

29:24.242 --> 29:27.534
I decided to donate money
to a homeless girl

29:27.667 --> 29:29.542
whom my friends and I encountered

29:29.750 --> 29:31.834
while travelling up north.

29:32.709 --> 29:34.217
So here's what happened.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.167
And cut.

30:12.950 --> 30:14.117
So where were you last night?

30:14.576 --> 30:15.651
I was at Val's place.

30:16.284 --> 30:17.992
But why aren't you answering your phone?

30:18.551 --> 30:20.800
I wasn't able to hear my ringtone, dad.

30:22.175 --> 30:23.192
Going to work?

30:23.742 --> 30:24.684
As always...

30:24.800 --> 30:26.134
Another business meeting.

30:26.509 --> 30:29.009
Do you want me to
buy you anything from Shanghai?

30:29.342 --> 30:31.417
- There's a store there that...
- No, I'm good.

30:31.759 --> 30:32.809
Bye!

32:52.676 --> 32:53.742
What the...

32:53.866 --> 32:56.166
(scream)

33:15.567 --> 33:17.776
I'll check your left eye, look up, please.

33:18.259 --> 33:19.467
Thank you, the other eye now.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.809
Okay, up!

33:21.083 --> 33:22.142
Thank you.

33:23.718 --> 33:25.175
Dad, what's wrong with her?

33:26.925 --> 33:28.301
Well, her BP's high.

33:29.009 --> 33:30.759
Are you stressed lately?

33:31.592 --> 33:34.634
Doc, I had a scary nightmare.

33:35.659 --> 33:39.992
It seems like there's a monster
that's bothering me in my sleep.

33:42.175 --> 33:46.009
Damn! I know what you are suffering from.

33:47.134 --> 33:49.009
Sleep paralysis.

33:49.426 --> 33:50.759
Sleep paralysis?

33:51.134 --> 33:53.509
When it happens, you cannot move, right?

33:54.567 --> 33:55.350
Yeah.

33:55.442 --> 33:59.983
And then you see a scary entity

34:00.175 --> 34:01.259
beside your bed...

34:02.009 --> 34:03.467
It could be a ghost,

34:04.859 --> 34:06.234
an elemental,

34:07.726 --> 34:09.141
or even a demon!

34:13.083 --> 34:14.118
But you know what,

34:14.208 --> 34:15.292
it's your mind

34:15.751 --> 34:16.833
playing tricks on you.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.501
It's just sleep paralysis.

34:19.083 --> 34:21.458
And it's been causing you stress!

34:22.250 --> 34:23.167
Doc, excuse me.

34:23.275 --> 34:24.626
Dr. Policarpio is calling you.

34:24.876 --> 34:25.641
Okay.

34:25.751 --> 34:26.751
Excuse me.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.234
Are you still thinking about the beggar?

34:34.708 --> 34:36.042
We went too far.

34:36.292 --> 34:37.318
Didn't we?

34:42.567 --> 34:45.275
What if you call your brother?
Or your Dad.

34:46.391 --> 34:47.467
What for?

34:48.333 --> 34:50.458
They will just tell me, this is what I get

34:50.667 --> 34:51.701
for being a brat.

34:53.751 --> 34:56.333
Sherwin, we should find the beggar.

34:56.792 --> 34:57.875
Why?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.325
To check on her!

34:59.584 --> 35:00.826
But she's alive, isn't she?

35:01.000 --> 35:01.726
I mean...

35:01.834 --> 35:03.209
That's what you and Val claim.

35:03.667 --> 35:04.701
Yes!

35:05.667 --> 35:07.417
But I wanna ask for forgiveness.

35:09.125 --> 35:12.142
Because it's the only way for me
to have peace of mind.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.042
Maybe, she goes to different places.

35:40.459 --> 35:41.584
Maybe you are right.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.567
What's our plan?

35:45.292 --> 35:46.626
We'll have to ask around.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.375
There, let's ask him.

35:54.401 --> 35:56.259
Excuse me, can we ask something?

35:56.542 --> 35:58.650
We are actually looking for a beggar.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.042
Jean!

36:01.334 --> 36:02.376
Jean!

36:05.292 --> 36:06.318
Jean!

36:11.918 --> 36:12.942
Jean...

36:15.334 --> 36:16.525
Jean, are you okay?

36:18.292 --> 36:19.450
She's sick.

36:19.718 --> 36:21.692
Is there any nearby hospital here?

36:21.876 --> 36:22.892
Just help me.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.283
Let's bring her to my mom.

36:24.767 --> 36:25.984
Is your mom a doctor?

36:26.292 --> 36:27.325
Let's hurry!

36:28.334 --> 36:29.425
Mom!

36:35.209 --> 36:36.342
Let her sit.

36:46.042 --> 36:47.118
Is she a doctor?

36:47.459 --> 36:48.492
Faith healer.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.884
It's an evil eye hex!

36:57.417 --> 36:58.918
Pwera usog.

37:06.676 --> 37:08.100
Mom, what happened?

37:08.434 --> 37:11.225
It's not an ordinary
person that has hexed her.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.584
I knew the time would come
that I'll be needing this.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.492
What the hell is that?!

37:50.601 --> 37:52.226
That's the saliva of Mom Minda.

37:52.617 --> 37:54.225
But that's not just any saliva.

37:54.459 --> 37:55.792
It's a powerful saliva.

38:02.709 --> 38:05.542
Pwera usog!

38:14.617 --> 38:15.734
She's safe now.

38:17.076 --> 38:18.325
She needs to rest.

38:29.709 --> 38:30.859
This is a secluded place.

38:31.701 --> 38:32.767
Sorry about that.

38:34.034 --> 38:35.109
How's Jean?

38:35.118 --> 38:35.926
She's fine.

38:36.034 --> 38:37.826
It's good that we found out early.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.675
It's a serious case of evil eye hex
that happened to your girlfriend.

38:40.784 --> 38:42.267
She's not my girlfriend.

38:43.118 --> 38:44.226
Before we were...

38:45.575 --> 38:47.659
Wait... what is usog?

38:51.242 --> 38:52.826
When a person has it,

38:54.325 --> 38:55.409
usually children.

38:56.826 --> 38:58.942
An illness happens just by
getting a simple greeting

38:58.951 --> 39:01.242
or a bad stare from a stranger.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.992
They say it's from usog.

39:12.659 --> 39:17.742
There are also cases that
it's from the stare of a bad spirit.

39:21.034 --> 39:22.209
An elemental...

39:25.450 --> 39:26.826
even by a demon.

39:30.751 --> 39:32.584
-Ouch! Ouch!
- What happened to you, my child!

39:33.367 --> 39:35.250
-What's hurting you?
-Ouch! Ouch!

39:43.242 --> 39:44.359
Why?

39:44.784 --> 39:46.034
My dad's a doctor.

39:46.617 --> 39:47.609
A real doctor.

39:47.784 --> 39:49.983
He doesn't believe in things like that.

39:51.242 --> 39:52.351
How about you?

39:53.909 --> 39:55.026
Do you believe in it?

40:14.118 --> 40:15.201
Hey...

40:15.617 --> 40:16.867
What's wrong, baby?

40:18.409 --> 40:19.492
Nothing.

40:20.909 --> 40:23.492
I've been thinking about my dream.

40:24.575 --> 40:25.992
It's so strange!

40:27.325 --> 40:28.467
Let me guess!

40:29.242 --> 40:32.534
You dreamt about a
shadowy figure with strange eyes!

40:33.826 --> 40:34.901
How did you know?

40:35.951 --> 40:37.017
Is that it?

40:37.092 --> 40:38.134
Is that what you dreamt of?

40:38.242 --> 40:40.325
Yes, that's it but you guessed it!

40:40.951 --> 40:43.367
Maybe because I dreamt about
it also, I don't know!

40:44.051 --> 40:47.425
But we easily forget what
we dreamt of, right?

40:50.026 --> 40:53.192
Baby... stop thinking about her!

40:53.634 --> 40:54.642
Okay?

40:55.092 --> 40:56.209
It's fine!

40:56.675 --> 40:57.801
Just stop thinking.

40:58.709 --> 41:02.259
But what if, we really killed her!
What would we have done?

41:02.467 --> 41:04.550
So we killed her! Who cares?

41:05.542 --> 41:06.750
She's homeless!

41:07.583 --> 41:09.042
No one's gonna miss her.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.675
You know, you are mean!

41:21.967 --> 41:23.101
Know what else?

41:23.550 --> 41:25.051
I'm sexy as hell!

41:35.634 --> 41:36.667
What?

41:37.091 --> 41:38.291
Shh! Shh!

41:40.592 --> 41:42.101
-What is it!
-Wait!

41:47.092 --> 41:48.126
Bobby!

42:15.884 --> 42:16.975
Hello?

42:24.592 --> 42:25.875
Bobby! What is it!

42:27.775 --> 42:29.692
Nothing, I thought I saw something.

42:31.325 --> 42:34.118
Bobby! Whatâ€™s the matter?

42:58.234 --> 42:59.518
I think I'm okay now.

43:05.176 --> 43:06.884
I think I might be overdosing.

43:09.425 --> 43:10.476
Bobby!

43:10.801 --> 43:11.809
Bobby!

43:15.801 --> 43:17.550
What's happening to him!

43:18.517 --> 43:21.134
Bobby... what's happening to him!

43:21.283 --> 43:22.583
Someone tell me!

43:24.383 --> 43:27.259
The liquid from Miss Minda
that you used with Jean,

43:28.134 --> 43:29.209
is that really saliva?

43:29.459 --> 43:30.542
Yes.

43:30.926 --> 43:32.717
It's Aunt Magda and mine.

43:33.909 --> 43:35.792
We saved it when she was still alive.

43:36.092 --> 43:39.550
Our family had been curing such
illnesses for many generation.

43:40.542 --> 43:45.084
But there are some cases that
a simple saliva won't work anymore,

43:45.259 --> 43:50.009
that's why we decided to
save some magical saliva.

43:51.001 --> 43:54.209
And that is what mom Minda used with Jean.

43:58.209 --> 43:59.150
Jean!

43:59.292 --> 44:00.459
Do you feel okay?

44:04.675 --> 44:07.675
Does the beggar have
something to do with this?

44:08.834 --> 44:09.834
Beggar?

44:10.167 --> 44:11.418
Come on, Jean.

44:11.634 --> 44:13.218
I think we should go.

44:13.592 --> 44:14.884
We will go ahead.

44:15.459 --> 44:17.001
Thank you very much!

44:17.392 --> 44:18.417
Wait!

44:22.359 --> 44:23.759
You should wear these.

44:24.650 --> 44:26.334
It's a protection from bad elements.

44:27.009 --> 44:29.217
Wear it, so you won't get hexed again.

44:32.917 --> 44:33.925
Thank you.

44:35.392 --> 44:37.434
Here's some money, buy some rice.

44:39.242 --> 44:41.359
We only help people in need.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.217
I don't ask for something in return.

45:14.884 --> 45:15.942
Bobby!

45:16.259 --> 45:17.267
Bobby!

45:19.692 --> 45:20.783
Bobby!

45:21.667 --> 45:22.692
Val!

45:23.518 --> 45:24.459
-Val!
-Val!

45:24.559 --> 45:25.600
What happened?

45:27.017 --> 45:28.101
He's dead!

45:29.184 --> 45:30.267
How?

45:30.376 --> 45:32.334
Doctor said it might be a drug overdose,

45:32.642 --> 45:34.101
but... but all that blood?

45:34.492 --> 45:36.159
It's not making any sense!

45:36.600 --> 45:38.476
But... Bobby isn't taking any drugs!

45:38.683 --> 45:42.267
He is but all that blood?
That can't be the reason!

45:42.659 --> 45:45.451
He told me he had the exact
same dream that I had.

45:45.767 --> 45:48.226
A shadow... no, a lady who looks like a...

45:48.434 --> 45:49.517
Witch.

45:49.975 --> 45:51.559
Yes! You too?!

45:53.659 --> 45:55.683
Oh, my God! It's that beggar girl!

45:55.892 --> 45:56.825
She's the witch!

45:56.934 --> 45:58.642
That's why she didn't die
when she fell off the building,

45:58.850 --> 46:00.518
And she's coming after us, one by one!

46:01.101 --> 46:02.159
Guys...

46:02.434 --> 46:03.284
Help me!

46:03.434 --> 46:04.159
Help me!

46:04.267 --> 46:05.876
-Help me! I'm next!
-Val! Val!

46:06.725 --> 46:07.776
Val!

46:07.867 --> 46:08.951
Jean.

46:09.451 --> 46:10.475
Nurse!

46:13.809 --> 46:15.142
Your dad called me.

46:15.559 --> 46:16.934
He's asking if you're doing fine.

46:18.226 --> 46:19.359
What did you say?

46:19.975 --> 46:21.776
I told him you're having sleep paralysis.

46:22.017 --> 46:23.434
It's not sleep paralysis!

46:23.642 --> 46:25.059
What do you want me to say?

46:25.309 --> 46:26.934
The faith healer's diagnosis?

46:29.518 --> 46:30.592
Anyway...

46:31.351 --> 46:33.942
He wants me to look after
you while he's gone.

46:34.434 --> 46:37.975
Next time if he ask, tell him I'm fine.

46:39.934 --> 46:41.050
I have a question.

46:42.267 --> 46:43.301
For the record,

46:43.476 --> 46:46.184
I'm still not convinced that
these are all supernatural.

46:47.518 --> 46:49.975
But... if it's really supernatural,

46:50.809 --> 46:52.184
why is Val safe?

46:56.351 --> 46:57.476
What do you mean?

46:57.809 --> 47:00.017
She also dreamt of the witch, right?

47:00.683 --> 47:03.342
Why hasn't she became
sick like you and Bobby?

47:05.992 --> 47:06.976
Auntie.

47:07.083 --> 47:08.101
How is she?

47:08.518 --> 47:09.883
She's still asleep.

47:13.767 --> 47:15.526
What happened to you, my child?

47:26.850 --> 47:31.476
You know, when she told
me she doesn't need me...

47:32.259 --> 47:34.509
That Bobby will take care of her anyway,

47:34.883 --> 47:36.301
that hurt me the most.

47:37.434 --> 47:39.892
I pray for my child every night!

47:40.809 --> 47:43.934
So that she will be protected
from any misfortune.

47:55.809 --> 47:57.059
She still has it.

47:58.909 --> 48:00.134
Where did that come from?

48:02.217 --> 48:04.759
From a faith healer,

48:05.600 --> 48:09.683
but... I cannot remember her name.

48:10.301 --> 48:11.501
Sorry about that...

48:11.850 --> 48:13.934
Minda, is that her name?

48:14.725 --> 48:17.267
Do you think the witch will harm me?

48:17.676 --> 48:19.975
I mean, I did not take
part in the prank, did I?

48:20.384 --> 48:21.967
You haven't dreamt of it?

48:22.592 --> 48:23.634
I'm not sure.

48:24.634 --> 48:27.384
I often forget about my dreams.

48:28.676 --> 48:32.759
Anyway, Miss Minda gave
you an amulet, right?

48:34.092 --> 48:35.267
About that...

48:37.301 --> 48:38.675
-I threw it away.
-What?

48:39.175 --> 48:39.942
Why?

48:40.050 --> 48:41.259
I wasn't a believer.

48:44.009 --> 48:45.076
Until now.

48:45.800 --> 48:49.384
Well, technically I still don't believe
all these supernatural things you said.

48:49.592 --> 48:50.684
Okay...

48:50.859 --> 48:51.859
But fine,

48:52.551 --> 48:54.559
I now acknowledge the possibility.

48:59.342 --> 49:00.559
Give me some alms, please.

49:02.301 --> 49:03.859
Please give me some alms.

49:09.950 --> 49:11.700
That's mine!

49:15.025 --> 49:17.359
Tomorrow, we'll be able to eat.

49:19.883 --> 49:20.967
Hello.

49:21.491 --> 49:22.691
Huh!

49:24.759 --> 49:26.384
What is your name?

49:26.676 --> 49:28.384
Who are you talking to?

49:30.967 --> 49:31.983
Her...

49:44.250 --> 49:46.876
You're just hungry, go to sleep.

49:59.509 --> 50:02.009
Luna, look at what I found!

50:03.384 --> 50:05.134
Look at what I found.

50:05.676 --> 50:08.676
It seems that it isn't rotten yet,
we can still eat that.

50:09.009 --> 50:09.918
No!

50:10.092 --> 50:10.918
Why?

50:10.967 --> 50:12.609
This is for my new friend!

50:14.009 --> 50:16.217
Hey, Luna! Where are we going?

50:20.842 --> 50:23.467
Hey, the owner might catch us!

50:23.676 --> 50:25.634
The owner is my friend!

50:28.967 --> 50:30.384
This is for you.

50:33.692 --> 50:35.575
Luna! What's up with you?

50:42.259 --> 50:43.509
Quintin...

50:44.833 --> 50:48.033
(scream)

50:58.067 --> 50:59.151
Quintin,

50:59.742 --> 51:01.276
can you pass me the egg.

51:02.476 --> 51:03.584
Quintin!

51:03.867 --> 51:04.526
Yes?

51:04.634 --> 51:06.217
Get me a glass of egg.

51:10.759 --> 51:12.259
Do you have a problem?

51:22.192 --> 51:23.276
Mom,

51:24.042 --> 51:25.801
I dreamt about Luna.

51:26.892 --> 51:27.534
And the...

51:27.642 --> 51:28.976
the soul of Catalina.

51:30.018 --> 51:31.042
Yes.

51:33.667 --> 51:36.683
I think it's the right time for you
to know the whole truth.

51:39.709 --> 51:42.709
Last night, when I was examining the girl.

51:43.809 --> 51:47.059
I saw that Catalina was
the one who hexed her!

51:48.334 --> 51:50.042
Mom, Jean told me something.

51:50.559 --> 51:51.809
Regarding a beggar.

51:53.517 --> 51:55.084
Don't you think it was Luna?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.334
There is a possibility that

51:58.709 --> 52:00.667
Jean did something to Luna

52:01.125 --> 52:03.167
that made Catalina's soul angry.

52:05.442 --> 52:06.742
Where are you going?

52:07.000 --> 52:08.375
Mom, I will look for Luna.

52:08.709 --> 52:09.801
And then?

52:10.042 --> 52:11.876
We've abandoned her before,

52:12.959 --> 52:14.584
are we going to do that again?

52:15.459 --> 52:18.751
Did you forget how your Grandma Magda died.

52:26.751 --> 52:27.801
My child!

52:30.667 --> 52:31.826
Luna!

52:38.501 --> 52:39.392
No!

52:39.501 --> 52:40.959
Let's get her, please!

52:41.250 --> 52:43.125
Catalina's soul is watching her.

52:44.584 --> 52:45.959
I can feel her.

52:54.384 --> 52:55.450
Where did she go?

52:59.734 --> 53:00.742
Where is she.

53:02.709 --> 53:05.000
Minda, give me the bottle of...

53:08.759 --> 53:09.909
This body is mine!

53:10.250 --> 53:12.959
Whoever invades her, I will surely kill!

53:13.167 --> 53:15.918
Minda, bring Quintin out of here! Faster!

53:53.517 --> 53:54.600
Mom...

53:54.751 --> 53:57.501
If you didn't save and adopt
me when I was a child,

53:58.125 --> 53:59.501
I'm sure, just like Luna,

54:00.083 --> 54:01.517
I'd be in the evil side now.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.792
What's the use of the power God gave us

54:05.167 --> 54:07.659
if we're not going to use it
to help people who are in need.

54:09.834 --> 54:11.918
Quintin, you're like a child to me.

54:12.125 --> 54:14.118
I don't want anything bad
to ever happen to you.

54:14.375 --> 54:15.409
I know, Mom.

54:16.626 --> 54:17.926
Don't worry about me.

54:18.501 --> 54:19.884
I will take care of myself.

54:21.834 --> 54:23.276
Hello! Anybody here?

54:25.834 --> 54:27.992
-Quintin! Quintin! We need your help!
- Jean! Itâ€™s good that you came here to see us again!

54:28.000 --> 54:29.918
-There are things happening with my friends that we
cannot explain! - You mentioned about a beggar yesterday.

54:30.125 --> 54:35.292
-Can you describe her to me? Jean! Listen to me! - We
met a girl beggar. We need your help! Listen to me!

54:35.501 --> 54:36.501
Wait! Wait!

54:37.225 --> 54:39.267
How can you understand each other?!

54:40.809 --> 54:41.926
You pushed her?

54:42.125 --> 54:43.034
No!

54:43.083 --> 54:44.159
She fell off!

54:44.642 --> 54:46.283
I think she moved back because
she was frightened.

54:46.434 --> 54:49.475
But when we go down to look
for her, she wasn't there!

54:51.142 --> 54:52.459
It's Catalina's ploy.

54:52.867 --> 54:53.867
Catalina?

54:54.367 --> 54:58.367
Yes. Since I was a child,
I've been hearing things about Catalina.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.584
Catalina is living alone in a mansion.

55:01.792 --> 55:02.992
In the middle of a forest.

55:07.484 --> 55:10.692
In our town, there have been
frequent cases of missing persons.

55:11.250 --> 55:13.501
Many of them were children.

56:16.792 --> 56:21.375
Catalina was abducting these children
and taking them home.

56:29.709 --> 56:33.125
That's where she sucked up
all the energy of the children

56:33.501 --> 56:34.876
until they died.

56:38.584 --> 56:40.167
When the townsmen found out about it,

56:40.626 --> 56:45.209
they all went to Catalina's
mansion to get rid of her.

56:49.042 --> 56:51.167
But even though Catalina was dead,

56:51.918 --> 56:55.250
she was still abducting people,

56:55.459 --> 56:57.459
to suck up all their energy.

56:59.584 --> 57:01.250
Catalina is taking her revenge on you.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.501
Because you hurt the only remaining person
she is getting her powers from.

57:06.601 --> 57:07.667
Is it Luna?

57:09.292 --> 57:10.292
Wait a minute,

57:10.834 --> 57:12.034
I cannot understand.

57:12.992 --> 57:14.200
Quintin mentioned

57:14.409 --> 57:16.784
-that she was still a kid
when she adopted... -abducted...

57:18.617 --> 57:21.159
when Catalina's soul abducted Luna.

57:21.992 --> 57:24.826
But, why is she still alive now?

57:25.659 --> 57:28.409
Why is she still alive unlike
the children she abducted before?

57:29.826 --> 57:34.034
Because instead of getting all her
energy at once, she took care of her.

57:34.951 --> 57:35.917
For what?

57:36.192 --> 57:39.151
To get energy from Luna little by little
while she's still alive?

57:40.409 --> 57:42.067
Just like a fruit bearing plant.

57:42.492 --> 57:44.742
You take care of it first
before harvesting its fruit.

57:45.034 --> 57:46.283
When it is time to eat.

57:46.492 --> 57:47.617
Luna is not a plant.

57:51.884 --> 57:55.550
Jean, can you bring me
where you found Luna?

57:59.509 --> 58:02.259
It is inside this building
where we first found Luna.

58:03.992 --> 58:05.109
Alright, thank you.

58:05.283 --> 58:06.325
You can go ahead.

58:06.534 --> 58:08.575
No! We will accompany you.

58:09.842 --> 58:10.850
Jean...

58:11.051 --> 58:14.342
Catalina will not leave us
alone 'till we fix this mess!

58:15.759 --> 58:18.534
What do you think we can
do against a ghost witch?

58:20.659 --> 58:21.650
Nothing...

58:21.759 --> 58:22.625
See...

58:22.834 --> 58:24.834
But we can help Quintin.

58:25.276 --> 58:26.351
Am I right?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.226
Fine,

58:29.951 --> 58:31.325
But we won't stay here late.

58:32.034 --> 58:34.651
We only have 2 hours left
before the sun down.

59:11.109 --> 59:11.917
Jean!

59:12.026 --> 59:13.983
We only have 30 minutes
left before getting dark.

59:17.483 --> 59:18.925
Sherwin, did you see Luna?

59:19.283 --> 59:20.300
What happened?

59:21.926 --> 59:23.075
What's up with you guys!

59:24.801 --> 59:26.342
Please don't scare me!

59:36.242 --> 59:37.284
Sherwin!

59:38.034 --> 59:39.159
Sherwin!

59:39.467 --> 59:41.083
-Why?
-What are you doing there?

01:00:07.492 --> 01:00:08.642
-Why?
-Jean!

01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:11.367
Bro!

01:00:12.425 --> 01:00:13.492
The doll!

01:00:14.492 --> 01:00:15.550
That's Luna's!

01:01:28.867 --> 01:01:34.367
You will never get her
from me, I will kill you!

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.200
Quintin! Please help me!

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.367
Help me please!

01:01:52.826 --> 01:01:53.892
Quintin!

01:01:54.283 --> 01:01:55.917
-Quintin! Quintin!
-Quintin!

01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:04.534
-Quintin! Quintin! Come on! Come on!
-Quintin! Quintin!

01:02:05.992 --> 01:02:07.242
-Quintin!
-Quintin!

01:02:07.742 --> 01:02:10.159
-Quintin! Quintin!
-Quintin! Wake up!

01:02:10.417 --> 01:02:12.125
Quintin! Quintin! Quintin! Quintin!

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.217
Luna!

01:02:21.701 --> 01:02:22.650
Quintin!

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:25.509
Minda, Quintin is in trouble...

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.700
Mom Magda?

01:02:39.142 --> 01:02:40.401
Is she there?

01:02:41.142 --> 01:02:42.225
No!

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:43.918
Nothing.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:52.809
Quintin!

01:02:56.392 --> 01:02:57.401
-Jean!
-Luna!

01:03:21.892 --> 01:03:23.025
Sherwin?

01:03:24.809 --> 01:03:25.892
Sherwin!

01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:29.925
Quintin!

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:49.025
Jean!

01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:51.183
That's enough!

01:04:06.934 --> 01:04:07.942
Luna!

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:09.859
Luna!

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.942
Luna!

01:04:16.725 --> 01:04:17.918
Luna!

01:04:21.267 --> 01:04:22.459
Quintin help!

01:04:22.809 --> 01:04:23.876
Jean!

01:04:30.351 --> 01:04:31.559
Sherwin...

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:32.967
It didn't help.

01:04:33.518 --> 01:04:35.275
I think Catalina's power is too strong.

01:04:35.683 --> 01:04:37.142
So what are we going to do?

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.234
Here Jean, wear this.

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:43.934
That's just protection, it's not a cure.

01:04:45.975 --> 01:04:47.150
Sherwin...

01:04:47.892 --> 01:04:49.017
What if I kiss her?

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.250
You're not together, right?

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.334
Quintin, what are we going to do?

01:05:02.267 --> 01:05:04.434
Mom... Mom, please help...

01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:09.683
The girl with Quintin is in grave danger.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.725
Because of Catalina's evil eye hex.

01:05:13.892 --> 01:05:15.975
Mom Magda, what can I do?

01:05:16.767 --> 01:05:22.017
If witches can hex from afar.

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:26.975
We, folk healer can also cure from afar.

01:05:28.517 --> 01:05:32.142
But Mom Magda,
my powers cannot cure from afar.

01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:36.434
You can, you just have to believe.

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:40.718
You just have to believe!

01:05:49.518 --> 01:05:50.617
Jean!

01:05:55.975 --> 01:05:56.976
Mom?

01:06:10.351 --> 01:06:11.467
Sherwin...

01:06:23.759 --> 01:06:25.401
Pwera usog!

01:06:40.342 --> 01:06:41.409
Jean?

01:06:42.134 --> 01:06:43.159
Jean!

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:45.076
Jean!

01:06:45.592 --> 01:06:46.617
Jean!

01:06:48.426 --> 01:06:49.525
Jean...

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.176
Are you okay?

01:06:56.217 --> 01:06:57.225
She's fine.

01:07:07.134 --> 01:07:08.250
My child.

01:07:11.883 --> 01:07:12.959
Mom, thank you.

01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:15.467
Mom, how did you heal her from afar?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.092
In time, I will teach you.

01:07:22.825 --> 01:07:24.034
Miss Minda,

01:07:24.342 --> 01:07:25.509
Can we take a bath?

01:07:26.634 --> 01:07:27.925
I have vomit on me.

01:07:28.734 --> 01:07:29.867
Okay.

01:07:30.301 --> 01:07:35.551
Can I also get another...
protection amulet?

01:07:36.634 --> 01:07:37.676
5,000 pesos.

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:40.984
What?

01:07:41.718 --> 01:07:42.834
I'm just kidding.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.009
Let's go, come inside.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.426
Let's all hold our hands.

01:07:56.359 --> 01:07:58.234
Don't release your hands until I say so.

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:29.209
What happened?

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.809
Quintin...

01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:40.759
Mom?

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:42.767
Miss Minda!

01:08:49.718 --> 01:08:50.975
Catalina!

01:08:51.216 --> 01:08:52.841
Stop bothering me!

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:54.292
Bring Luna back!

01:08:58.591 --> 01:08:59.658
Don't let go!

01:09:46.734 --> 01:09:47.776
I saw Luna.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:51.392
At Catalina's antique house in the forest.

01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:53.475
I will save her, Mom.

01:09:54.267 --> 01:09:56.684
You cannot go there alone.
I will come along.

01:09:58.892 --> 01:10:01.642
It's time to end Catalina's evilness.

01:10:02.059 --> 01:10:03.859
For the sake of my Mom Magda.

01:10:04.684 --> 01:10:06.018
Quintin, get ready.

01:10:07.475 --> 01:10:08.476
Hey!

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:11.392
Why?

01:10:12.142 --> 01:10:13.850
I thought nobody should
release their hands?

01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:15.009
We can do that now.

01:11:04.018 --> 01:11:06.059
Quintin, give me the bottle of egg.

01:11:14.434 --> 01:11:15.767
I cannot see her here.

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:17.475
Let's go inside.

01:11:48.134 --> 01:11:49.667
Catalina!

01:11:50.976 --> 01:11:52.084
Quintin...

01:12:07.684 --> 01:12:08.734
Luna!

01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:15.892
Luna.

01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:19.259
I can feel that she is being watched
by Catalina.

01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:21.950
Surround her with salt.

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:49.242
When you see me trying to fight,

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.409
pull me away from the circle.

01:12:52.909 --> 01:12:55.492
What will happen if we
don't pull you away on time?

01:12:56.492 --> 01:13:01.159
My soul will vanish to other dimension.

01:13:01.534 --> 01:13:02.583
Then?

01:13:04.242 --> 01:13:05.318
She will die.

01:13:08.242 --> 01:13:09.951
Her earthly body will die

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.784
when it doesn't have a soul.

01:13:38.409 --> 01:13:40.034
Help me, please...

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.509
Where is Catalina?

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.433
Quinton.

01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:26.657
Quinton!

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.242
Quintin! Help me!

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:00.542
It's time! Itâ€™s time!

01:15:08.742 --> 01:15:11.301
Mom... Mom!...Mom!

01:15:14.425 --> 01:15:15.451
Mom!

01:15:15.775 --> 01:15:16.776
Mom!

01:15:17.151 --> 01:15:18.217
Mom!

01:15:19.234 --> 01:15:20.275
Mom!

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:21.692
Mom, wake up!

01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:23.442
Mom!

01:15:24.076 --> 01:15:25.101
Mom!

01:15:25.218 --> 01:15:26.259
Mom!

01:15:26.942 --> 01:15:28.009
Mom!

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:32.742
She's gone...

01:15:54.817 --> 01:15:55.867
Stupid!

01:15:57.634 --> 01:15:58.759
Quintin!

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:03.083
(scream)

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.151
Jean! Close the door!

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:58.742
-Jean! Go ahead. I will take care of this.
-What? What are you going to do here?

01:16:59.192 --> 01:17:00.400
Just always remember,

01:17:01.259 --> 01:17:02.451
I love you.

01:17:05.109 --> 01:17:07.525
Sherwin, your amulet! Where is it?

01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:09.683
I think it fell off!

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.717
Sherwin! Sherwin!

01:17:16.192 --> 01:17:17.234
Sherwin!

01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:20.242
Sherwin!

01:17:41.276 --> 01:17:42.334
Catalina!

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:48.901
That's enough...

01:17:49.334 --> 01:17:50.359
Luna...

01:17:52.092 --> 01:17:54.192
Leave me and Catalina alone.

01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:58.251
If it weren't for her I'd already be gone.

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:02.109
Luna, I am already here.

01:18:03.442 --> 01:18:05.400
Staring today, I will take care of you.

01:18:08.318 --> 01:18:09.942
Why just now, Quintin?

01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:14.817
You abandoned me!

01:18:27.483 --> 01:18:28.576
Luna...

01:18:43.609 --> 01:18:44.618
Catalina!

01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:45.850
Face me!

01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:47.792
You, bastard witch!

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:31.709
Take me instead!

01:19:32.192 --> 01:19:34.525
Give Luna her freedom, please!

01:19:47.567 --> 01:19:49.234
I don't need you anymore!

01:20:13.151 --> 01:20:14.984
Traitor!

01:21:04.683 --> 01:21:05.726
Quintin?

01:21:05.934 --> 01:21:06.942
Is that really you?

01:21:10.725 --> 01:21:14.392
The good lady offered
herself in place of me.

01:21:15.367 --> 01:21:16.450
Who?

01:21:42.975 --> 01:21:45.809
Jean! Jean! Jean! Jean! Jean!
Youâ€™re safe now.

01:21:46.892 --> 01:21:47.959
Youâ€™re safe now.

01:21:47.975 --> 01:21:49.059
Where's Luna?

01:21:49.226 --> 01:21:50.892
She's safe, because of you.

01:21:52.267 --> 01:21:53.375
Youâ€™re safe now.

01:21:54.017 --> 01:21:55.175
Jean!

01:21:56.934 --> 01:21:58.050
Jean!

01:21:58.059 --> 01:21:59.101
Sherwin!

01:22:00.434 --> 01:22:02.051
Sherwin! Sherwin! Sherwin!

01:22:02.434 --> 01:22:03.892
Sherwin! Sherwin!

01:22:05.725 --> 01:22:10.518
Quintin! He had been hexed by Catalina.
Do you still have saliva from Miss Minda?

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:11.759
It was all gone.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.667
Sherwin...

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:19.259
Pwera usog.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.518
Sherwin! Sherwin! Sherwin!

01:22:32.476 --> 01:22:34.351
Pwera usog.

01:22:36.725 --> 01:22:37.792
Sherwin...

01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:39.317
Sherwin...

01:22:41.267 --> 01:22:42.292
Sherwin...

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:45.600
You can be a folk healer, Jean.

01:22:51.017 --> 01:22:52.642
That's only a sleep paralysis.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.017
You will pay for your absurdity!

01:23:19.309 --> 01:23:21.476
You can never bother this
world anymore, Catalina!

01:23:30.642 --> 01:23:34.518
Do you really think that
thing will kill me?

01:23:47.842 --> 01:23:50.842
(chant)

01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:59.666
(chant)

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:18.134
Mom, Grandma, please give me strength...

01:24:32.558 --> 01:24:42.658
(chant)

01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:04.525
Quintin!

01:26:06.859 --> 01:26:08.442
I'll just finish healing them.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.334
Here...

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:13.209
Thank you.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.667
Quintin, we still have it.

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:23.051
Miss Minda gave it to us.

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:24.359
This is different.

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:26.292
This is not protection from getting hexed.

01:26:26.459 --> 01:26:28.126
This is to strengthen your spirit force.

01:26:30.584 --> 01:26:31.617
What?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.959
A spirit force is the
power inside our body.

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:38.626
It can be used to do good deeds.

01:26:39.834 --> 01:26:42.375
Jean, your inner power
seems to be stronger.

01:26:42.792 --> 01:26:45.167
Because you cured Sherwin
from Catalina's hex.

01:26:47.626 --> 01:26:48.884
How did it become stronger?

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:52.209
When you sacrificed yourself
for other people's sake.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.033
Nice!

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:03.918
Is Miss Minda really gone?

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:07.042
She isn't really gone.

01:27:07.501 --> 01:27:08.617
She and grandma...

01:27:09.459 --> 01:27:13.417
I can feel that they're always guiding us.

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.125
But still, it's better if they were here.

01:27:18.909 --> 01:27:20.118
You're crying again.

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:22.125
Don't worry. I am here.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:33.167
Hi! Hi to my subscribers and to my haters.

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.117
This is Jean Cordero and
this going to be my last blog.

01:27:37.626 --> 01:27:43.125
Tomorrow, I'm gonna have to shut down this
channel because I've decided to pursue

01:27:43.334 --> 01:27:47.709
better things.
See you around guys, as in, in real life.

01:27:52.283 --> 01:27:53.367
Jean.

01:27:54.167 --> 01:27:55.667
Hi, Dad! Welcome back!

01:27:56.959 --> 01:27:58.001
What's that?

01:27:58.334 --> 01:28:01.459
Dad, I've enrolled last
week in a university.

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.409
That's great!

01:28:04.509 --> 01:28:05.926
How much did you pay?

01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:08.375
My savings was a little hurt.

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.792
Don't worry I'm gonna
take care of your allowance.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.167
No, Dad, it's okay, I have my savings.

01:28:15.225 --> 01:28:18.250
But if my money runs out, lend me some.
Please, Dad?

01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:29.717
Sorry for everything, Dad.

01:28:34.334 --> 01:28:36.000
I'm the one who should be sorry.

01:28:37.751 --> 01:28:40.042
'Cause I never took time to reflect on what

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.209
you've been going through all these years.

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:45.209
After your Mom and I parted ways.

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:51.792
But from now on,

01:28:52.918 --> 01:28:54.559
everything will be different.

01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:56.826
I promise you that.

01:29:03.534 --> 01:29:04.709
You've been here for awhile?

01:29:08.826 --> 01:29:09.834
Wow!

01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:12.876
My girlfriend's very studious.

01:29:13.918 --> 01:29:15.209
I'm starving.

01:29:15.992 --> 01:29:18.534
-Wait, did you order the...
-Can I ask for alms...

01:29:19.167 --> 01:29:20.959
So I can buy food.

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.634
Go away! Why are you bothering them.

01:29:24.176 --> 01:29:27.342
-No, it's okay I'll take care of her.
-Ma'am, it's prohibited here.

01:29:27.626 --> 01:29:28.992
I'll be the one to pay for these, right?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.167
Just give me another one of these.

01:29:31.684 --> 01:29:32.783
Okay.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.459
You can eat now.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.775
Sit down.

01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:43.625
This is delicious.

01:29:46.626 --> 01:29:47.717
You're so kind.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.801
Wait, I will wash first.

01:29:51.009 --> 01:29:52.050
Okay.

01:29:59.267 --> 01:30:01.183
Hello, what is your name?

01:30:01.617 --> 01:30:02.642
Jean.

01:30:02.892 --> 01:30:04.267
And you, what is your...

01:30:08.392 --> 01:30:09.667
To whom are you talking to?

01:30:10.409 --> 01:30:11.451
It's her.

01:30:24.434 --> 01:30:25.450
Is this yours?

01:30:26.305 --> 01:30:32.168
