WEBVTT

00:03.332 --> 00:04.699
Damn, man.

00:04.734 --> 00:06.468
You look tired.
Your eyes are puffy as hell.

00:06.502 --> 00:09.304
I'm unwell, Winston.
(Sighs)

00:09.338 --> 00:11.873
I'm just torn up about this
whole Cece and Elizabeth thing.

00:11.907 --> 00:14.309
I feel so guilty, I can't even
look at myself in the mirror.

00:14.343 --> 00:15.810
Do you think that I'm good person?

00:15.845 --> 00:17.712
I'm gonna...

00:17.747 --> 00:18.980
Hey, guys, do you guys think
that I'm a good person?

00:19.015 --> 00:19.981
You're a terrible person.

00:20.016 --> 00:22.651
- It's hilarious.
- You cheated on my best friend, Schmidt.

00:22.685 --> 00:25.654
F-Fair enough. Okay.
Well, I'm better than Winston.

00:25.688 --> 00:28.056
You're better at things than Winston,
but he's a better person.

00:28.090 --> 00:30.456
- Winston freakin' stinks!
- Okay, why am I being dragged into this?

00:30.483 --> 00:32.389
Because I'm mad, Winston.

00:32.887 --> 00:35.331
And I'm tired. And...

00:35.402 --> 00:36.906
I'm a good...

00:37.178 --> 00:38.834
I'm a good man.

00:38.966 --> 00:40.642
Are you crying?

00:41.502 --> 00:43.203
(Knocking on door)

00:46.207 --> 00:47.808
I got a package for Nick Miller.

00:47.842 --> 00:50.355
There's nobody here
by that name.

00:50.812 --> 00:52.779
(Whispers):
I got this.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.781
I saw that.

00:54.816 --> 00:56.416
- Run, Nick! Run!
- Aah!

00:56.451 --> 00:57.722
What?

00:57.757 --> 01:00.085
Relax, I'm with your late father's estate.

01:00.288 --> 01:01.822
- Pop-pop?
- This is for him.

01:05.325 --> 01:07.427
What's in there?

01:07.462 --> 01:08.929
It's a hand, isn't it?
Just tell me if it's a hand.

01:08.963 --> 01:10.497
Oh, my God!

01:10.531 --> 01:12.933
- It is a hand.
- It's a... I knew it.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.968
It's a hand.
What does that mean, though?

01:15.002 --> 01:17.337
Full of dollar bills, y'all!

01:17.371 --> 01:19.372
You are rich, man!

01:19.507 --> 01:22.309
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ <i>Who's that girl? ♪</i>

01:22.343 --> 01:23.810
♪ Who's that girl? ♪

01:23.845 --> 01:25.512
♪ <i>Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess ♪</i>

01:25.646 --> 01:28.648
I can't believe Nick's dad
left him $8,000.

01:28.683 --> 01:31.151
I've never seen someone
burn through money so fast.

01:31.185 --> 01:33.286
- (Laughs)
- I should say something.

01:33.321 --> 01:34.688
Some of these shoes
aren't even his size.

01:34.722 --> 01:37.457
Look, Jess, you don't want to talk
to Nick about money, okay?

01:37.492 --> 01:39.693
It is a very touchy subject.

01:39.727 --> 01:41.661
I'm gonna check out
this fancy picture place.

01:41.696 --> 01:44.164
Seems like rich guys always have
pictures of themselves.

01:44.198 --> 01:47.267
My man. Do you, baby.
(Chuckles)

01:47.301 --> 01:49.669
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Nick owes me

01:49.704 --> 01:52.939
1,900 bucks, so this here
is my opportunity to get it back.

01:52.974 --> 01:54.975
JESS: How are you expecting
to get your money back

01:55.009 --> 01:56.943
if he blows it all on stupid stuff?

01:56.978 --> 01:59.045
WINSTON: Oh, don't worry, Jess.
I have a plan.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.647
Hey, listen, you know you
don't have to con him

02:00.681 --> 02:03.283
if he actually owes you money.
You can just ask him.

02:03.317 --> 02:08.155
(Laughing)

02:08.189 --> 02:10.991
I just told you to ask him
for the money.

02:11.993 --> 02:12.959
Smile...

02:12.994 --> 02:14.127
(Laughing)

02:14.162 --> 02:16.329
NICK: Do the crystals make it
look too glamorous?

02:16.364 --> 02:17.702
It's really glamorous.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.503
I don't even know.
I don't know what's cool anymore.

02:19.538 --> 02:21.568
It could be a good time
to start a bank account.

02:21.602 --> 02:23.370
Yeah, or I could just flush it
down the toilet.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.938
It's not really the same thing, but...

02:24.972 --> 02:28.074
A bank is just a paper bag
but with fancier walls.

02:28.109 --> 02:30.944
That's all it is. I'm gonna keep
my money where my mouth is.

02:30.978 --> 02:33.380
Um, under my nose.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.849
That saying actually does work.

02:41.656 --> 02:43.557
- What is that?
- This is my box.

02:43.591 --> 02:46.760
It's where I keep all my junk
that I don't feel like dealing with.

02:46.794 --> 02:49.329
That looks like a lot of bills.
It's... mostly bills.

02:49.363 --> 02:50.864
Like I said, it's junk.

02:50.898 --> 02:52.432
You know,
I'm just brainstorming here,

02:52.466 --> 02:53.867
but what if you paid some
of those bills

02:53.901 --> 02:55.468
with the money you just got?

02:55.503 --> 02:58.371
(Laughing):
Yeah. I'm gonna "pay my bill."

02:58.406 --> 03:01.641
And what's next? I'm gonna go
to the doctor and get a checkup.

03:01.676 --> 03:03.844
Give them $500 to check my bones.

03:03.878 --> 03:05.478
You're being funny.

03:12.353 --> 03:14.588
So, yeah, I was dating both
of them at the same time.

03:14.622 --> 03:17.991
I'm a mess. I can't sleep.
I urinate constantly.

03:18.025 --> 03:21.261
I cried the other day listening
to a techno song.

03:21.295 --> 03:23.163
My tweets have been extremely literal.

03:23.197 --> 03:24.898
Were the girls Jewish?

03:24.932 --> 03:26.900
One Indian, one regular.
Do you want to see a picture?

03:26.934 --> 03:28.735
I-I don't even know why you're here.

03:28.769 --> 03:31.204
You come in and say,
"Do you have a minute?"

03:31.239 --> 03:33.106
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Rabbi.
It's just that...

03:33.140 --> 03:36.109
Okay, it's much more simple.
(Sighs)

03:36.143 --> 03:37.944
How can I be a better person?

03:37.979 --> 03:39.880
Oh.

03:39.914 --> 03:42.282
Well, you seem awfully concerned
with yourself.

03:42.316 --> 03:45.352
You might want to start thinking
about the needs of others.

03:45.386 --> 03:46.753
I think about others all the time.

03:46.787 --> 03:49.389
What-what I can get from them,
how they can give me pleasure,

03:49.423 --> 03:50.557
do they have a silly little walk

03:50.591 --> 03:52.492
- that I can make fun of?
- No, th-that's...

03:52.526 --> 03:56.229
It's where you actually care
about somebody else.

03:56.264 --> 03:58.965
You put their needs ahead of your own.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.967
This is one of the few times
that I wish I was Catholic.

04:01.002 --> 04:03.536
Couple Hail Marys
and I'd be off the hook.

04:03.571 --> 04:05.205
Huh?

04:06.908 --> 04:07.941
(Car horn beeping)

04:07.975 --> 04:09.976
(Tires screech) (Woman screams)
(Bike clatters)

04:12.880 --> 04:14.514
Oh, God. Whoa.

04:14.548 --> 04:16.583
Are you choking?
You're choking. Okay.

04:16.617 --> 04:19.653
Uh... What, are you biking and eating?

04:19.687 --> 04:21.755
All right, I got you, I got you.

04:21.789 --> 04:23.823
(Grunts)
Come on! Live! Live!

04:23.858 --> 04:25.225
Live, biker!
(Gasps)

04:25.259 --> 04:27.060
- Ew. Yeah!
- Thank you.

04:27.094 --> 04:28.361
You saved my life.

04:28.396 --> 04:29.930
What?

04:29.964 --> 04:31.231
You saved my life.

04:32.767 --> 04:33.833
You saved my life.

04:33.868 --> 04:35.502
(Panting)

04:35.536 --> 04:39.506
- I did. Yes. Yes.
- Thank you... Thank you...

04:39.540 --> 04:42.242
Yes! Dude!

04:42.276 --> 04:45.178
This is exactly what I needed.
Oh, my God.

04:45.212 --> 04:47.414
Let us rejoice in song.

04:47.448 --> 04:50.083
♪ Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil ♪

04:50.117 --> 04:52.263
♪ Adonai Eloheinu ♪

04:52.302 --> 04:55.083
- Please call 911. I'm hurt.
- Oh, yeah, no, that's a great idea.

04:55.222 --> 04:56.756
I'm gonna call 911.
(Moans)

04:56.791 --> 04:58.391
I hope you don't have
a dance recital later.

04:58.426 --> 05:00.260
I'm just kidding.
Don't look at your legs.

05:00.294 --> 05:01.695
(Moaning)

05:01.729 --> 05:04.931
(Quietly): That's, uh, $900
to the Parking Authority of Los Angeles.

05:04.966 --> 05:08.268
Oh, is it okay to mail cash?

05:08.302 --> 05:11.237
I'm gonna do it anyway.
All right, it's on its way.

05:18.112 --> 05:19.913
- Sliders are beautiful.
- I know, man.

05:19.947 --> 05:22.248
- I knew you would think that.
- I love 'em, dude.

05:22.283 --> 05:23.583
That's why I made 'em.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.120
What is that?

05:27.154 --> 05:29.622
Brotherhood.
Brotherhood, man.

05:29.657 --> 05:31.825
All right, man. I respect you, man,
no matter what.

05:31.859 --> 05:34.828
That's what it's about, man.
Yeah, and, um...

05:34.862 --> 05:36.830
in the spirit of brotherhood...

05:36.864 --> 05:38.732
just 'cause we on that level right now...
I was just thinking

05:38.766 --> 05:41.568
- maybe, I don't know, um...
- Anything, man. Shoot.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.336
Oh, man.

05:43.371 --> 05:46.039
Maybe you can just pay me back
that money that you owe me.

05:46.073 --> 05:48.041
Remember?
'Cause you owe me that money...?

05:49.410 --> 05:52.312
- Uh, Nick? Nick?
- Oh...

05:52.346 --> 05:56.316
- Nick? Nick? Hey, Nick.
- Oh, you stink!

05:56.350 --> 05:58.752
- Um, can we...?
- You son of...

05:58.786 --> 06:01.721
- You son of a bitch, Winston!
- Can we... can we...

06:01.756 --> 06:02.822
That's what this is about?!

06:02.857 --> 06:05.592
Nick, it's my money, okay?!
Give it back to me!

06:05.626 --> 06:07.527
I make a little bit of money
and you come

06:07.561 --> 06:09.062
slipping out of the "woodword"!

06:09.096 --> 06:10.864
You mean "woodwork"?

06:10.898 --> 06:12.065
What is "woodwork"?!

06:12.099 --> 06:13.066
What's "woodword"?!

06:13.100 --> 06:14.567
Wood! Word! Wood! Word!

06:14.602 --> 06:17.003
(Groans) That's where people like you
come crawling out of

06:17.038 --> 06:18.438
when people like me have money!

06:18.472 --> 06:20.407
- But you owe me that money!
- Stay out of my damn box

06:20.441 --> 06:22.342
- is the point, man!
- I'm not in your box!

06:22.376 --> 06:24.511
Jess gets it, right?

06:24.545 --> 06:26.413
Yeah, what's...
What the hell, dude?

06:26.414 --> 06:28.314
I'm gonna go to the bar
to blow off some steam.

06:28.382 --> 06:29.883
That's a great idea.
Go get loaded.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.718
You deserve it. Black out.

06:31.752 --> 06:33.987
You are the only one
that I trust around here.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:52.773 --> 06:54.374
Oh...

06:54.408 --> 06:56.409
(Hoots)

06:56.444 --> 06:58.678
You went through Nick's box.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.950
Look, it was so much worse
than I thought.

07:02.985 --> 07:04.819
- (Chuckling)
- Why does he have the deed

07:04.853 --> 07:07.488
- to an old Mercury Cougar in there?
- Oh, yeah, he lost that.

07:07.523 --> 07:09.323
For crying out loud, where is it?
We've been looking for hours.

07:09.358 --> 07:11.526
- It's done.
- What about your car, Nick?

07:11.560 --> 07:14.444
I said it's done.

07:14.595 --> 07:15.988
I'll just get the money back.

07:16.026 --> 07:18.002
Bill collectors are reasonable people,
right?

07:18.073 --> 07:21.002
- That makes sense.
- You better keep your mouth shut!

07:21.036 --> 07:23.204
I'll make you a deal.
I'll keep my mouth shut

07:23.238 --> 07:25.373
if you pay me the money
Nick owes me.

07:25.407 --> 07:28.743
Are you trying to blackmail me?

07:30.312 --> 07:31.512
(Grunts)

07:31.547 --> 07:33.981
You don't scare me, Jess.

07:34.016 --> 07:35.917
(Shouting)

07:35.951 --> 07:38.352
(Both shouting)

07:39.721 --> 07:41.222
How much does Nick owe you?

07:41.256 --> 07:44.659
$1,900.
(Splutters)

07:44.693 --> 07:47.161
But what is money anyway?

07:47.195 --> 07:50.264
You know, it's just paper
that some king on the mountains

07:50.299 --> 07:52.533
said was worth something.

07:52.568 --> 07:55.169
You know? Gold, I understand.

07:55.203 --> 07:58.739
It's shiny and you can make
jewelry out of it.

07:58.774 --> 08:00.675
Silver?

08:00.709 --> 08:03.878
Put a werewolf in front of me,
he's dead.

08:03.912 --> 08:07.048
Brass creates the bells

08:07.082 --> 08:09.951
that make sound
throughout the land.

08:09.985 --> 08:13.621
But we kill each other for paper.

08:13.655 --> 08:16.223
I gotta tell you, man, that's sad.

08:16.258 --> 08:19.760
You give me $50,
I'll show you my private parts.

08:19.795 --> 08:22.563
(Laughs, splutters)

08:24.232 --> 08:26.200
Nicholas, good yontef.

08:26.234 --> 08:28.569
- Are you well?
- No, but good yontef.

08:28.604 --> 08:29.937
You know, I'm all steamed up.

08:29.972 --> 08:32.306
This money thing is
tearing me apart, Schmidt.

08:32.341 --> 08:34.575
All right, if it's bothering you that much,
why don't you just give it away?

08:34.610 --> 08:36.077
Son of a bitch!

08:36.111 --> 08:37.979
Not, not to me, Nick, to charity,

08:38.013 --> 08:39.914
or tzedakah as my people call it.

08:39.948 --> 08:41.549
- That's what your people do?
- Yeah.

08:41.582 --> 08:43.951
- You beautiful genius.
- (Laughs)

08:43.986 --> 08:46.387
I like that.
That frees me of my worries.

08:46.421 --> 08:48.089
Oh, look at that! Another mitzvah!
I'm two for two today.

08:48.123 --> 08:50.391
- Yeah! Mitzvah!
- I saved a man.

08:50.425 --> 08:52.159
You know, there was a lowly
bike messenger.

08:52.194 --> 08:53.995
Was just riding along,
choking on his gum.

08:54.029 --> 08:56.897
And I performed Heimlich's
maneuver on him, rescued him.

08:56.932 --> 08:58.399
- Great.
- Yeah, who's the good man now?

08:58.433 --> 09:00.486
You're almost forced to admit it.

09:01.436 --> 09:04.271
Almost...
You're almost forced to admit it.

09:04.306 --> 09:06.140
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm a hero, Nick, now...

09:06.174 --> 09:07.475
Just tell me that I'm a good man.

09:07.509 --> 09:08.843
I really need to hear it.

09:08.877 --> 09:11.212
I don't even know if I'm a good person.
I'm not the guy to ask.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.147
- I have my moods.
- But we're not talking about you.

09:13.181 --> 09:15.383
We're talking about me right
now and how I'm a good person,

09:15.417 --> 09:16.951
so it'd be really nice
if you could say that.

09:16.985 --> 09:18.019
- I'm ready to do a tzatziki.
- Tzedakah.

09:18.053 --> 09:19.720
This is not about tzedakah right now.

09:19.755 --> 09:21.822
This is about me being a good man
and you telling me that.

09:21.857 --> 09:23.658
- Absolutely.
- So, well, say it.

09:23.692 --> 09:25.960
- You got it.
- S-Say that I'm a good man.

09:25.994 --> 09:27.495
I'm giving away my money.
I've been trying to listen

09:27.529 --> 09:28.796
- to you this whole time!
- Damn it, Nick,

09:28.830 --> 09:31.165
you are so drunk right now

09:31.199 --> 09:32.700
- and at the bar you work at, no less.
- Yeah.

09:32.734 --> 09:33.968
What happens with
the rest of your day?

09:34.002 --> 09:35.202
Do you even think about that?

09:35.237 --> 09:37.171
You don't understand drinking at all.

09:39.441 --> 09:40.875
Don't go.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.011
Heathcliff.

09:44.046 --> 09:47.648
Hi, I'd like to unpay
some parking tickets.

09:47.683 --> 09:49.350
- Excuse me?
- Well, I sent in a payment

09:49.384 --> 09:51.052
earlier for some tickets

09:51.086 --> 09:53.554
and I decided I don't
want to pay them.

09:53.588 --> 09:54.889
Well, just cancel the checks.

09:54.923 --> 09:56.590
Can't do that 'cause I paid cash

09:56.625 --> 09:58.526
'cause my boyfriend
doesn't believe in banks.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.327
It's early in the relationship.

10:00.362 --> 10:02.596
Still shaving above the knee
if you know what I mean.

10:02.631 --> 10:04.198
Mm-hmm.
(Clicks tongue)

10:04.232 --> 10:06.701
Let me get this straight...
You want me to watch the mail

10:06.735 --> 10:09.170
and let you know if I see
anything from your boyfriend.

10:09.204 --> 10:11.872
- Exactly.
- Fantastic. Should I call you or...?

10:11.907 --> 10:13.340
- Text, text would be great.
- Perfect.

10:13.375 --> 10:17.044
Let me put your number
into my phone.

10:17.079 --> 10:19.947
- I didn't give you my number yet.
- Oh, I think you did.

10:21.283 --> 10:22.516
NICK:
It's your lucky day, old friend.

10:22.551 --> 10:23.517
I had an interesting
talk with Schmidt,

10:23.552 --> 10:25.453
and I've decided
to give away my fortune.

10:25.487 --> 10:27.021
So, what do I owe you?

10:27.055 --> 10:29.790
- How much money d...? Uh...
- Hey, guys, what's going on?

10:29.825 --> 10:31.392
Hey, Jess, um...

10:31.426 --> 10:32.526
It's tzatziki is what it's called.

10:32.561 --> 10:35.262
It's a Jewish charity.

10:37.265 --> 10:40.468
Nick was just about to pay me
the money that he owes me.

10:40.502 --> 10:42.670
Wait!

10:50.312 --> 10:51.312
Come on, what are you doing?

10:51.346 --> 10:54.582
I'm, uh, I'm lubing up, Sally...

10:54.616 --> 10:55.783
From ankles to ears?

10:55.817 --> 10:57.752
The door's locked...
You want me to bust in?

10:57.786 --> 11:00.654
Son of a...

11:00.689 --> 11:01.922
It opened!

11:01.957 --> 11:04.291
Where are you?

11:04.326 --> 11:08.095
Um, I just was hot,
I wanted some shade.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.764
Oh, done that.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.234
He take my money?

11:13.268 --> 11:14.602
Winston!

11:14.636 --> 11:16.103
It was me, it was me, it was me.

11:16.138 --> 11:18.472
I'm so sorry,
I went through your box...

11:18.507 --> 11:20.107
I just couldn't help it...
and I paid some

11:20.142 --> 11:22.743
of your bills, and I'm so sorry I...

11:22.778 --> 11:25.513
Hey, Nick...

11:25.547 --> 11:27.414
You gonna leave me here?

11:27.449 --> 11:29.996
Nick... That's fair.

11:32.927 --> 11:35.281
There he is, alive and well.

11:35.316 --> 11:35.867
Yeah.

11:35.902 --> 11:36.868
Mazel.

11:36.903 --> 11:37.903
I br-brought you these.

11:39.105 --> 11:41.206
How's my brave little soldier doing, huh?

11:41.240 --> 11:43.141
Not great.

11:43.176 --> 11:45.644
They said that I'm never gonna
be able to ride a bike again,

11:45.678 --> 11:47.712
- so there goes my job.
- Sure, sure.

11:47.747 --> 11:49.381
Do you think that I'm a good person?

11:49.415 --> 11:53.151
I... I don't really know you.

11:53.186 --> 11:54.686
Well, what more do you need to know?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.588
If not for me, you probably
would have died today.

11:56.622 --> 11:58.423
Well, somebody probably
would have come along.

11:58.457 --> 12:00.091
Just say that I'm a good person.

12:00.126 --> 12:02.127
- Well, I mean...
- Why is that so hard for you to say?

12:02.161 --> 12:04.462
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

12:04.497 --> 12:06.431
- You're, you're a good person.
- I am? You really think so?

12:06.465 --> 12:07.766
Very good.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.767
Thank you for saying that.

12:08.801 --> 12:10.068
- Yeah.
- That really means...

12:10.102 --> 12:11.636
It means a lot.
(Chuckles)

12:11.671 --> 12:13.905
I finally feel
like I can breathe again.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.740
Good.
(Sighs)

12:15.775 --> 12:17.475
What happ...
What happened to him?

12:17.510 --> 12:19.911
Well, he got smoked by a bus
while he was having a bake sale

12:19.946 --> 12:21.479
for cancer kids.

12:21.514 --> 12:23.415
For, for canc... for cancer kids?

12:23.449 --> 12:26.017
- Yeah.
- But he-he's, he's a great person.

12:26.052 --> 12:28.286
Bad things happen to good people
all the time.

12:29.322 --> 12:31.590
Of course they do.

12:31.624 --> 12:33.658
What am I even chasing here?

12:33.693 --> 12:35.961
What is the point
of being a good person?

12:35.995 --> 12:39.264
Some say moral integrity is
the cornerstone to humanity.

12:39.298 --> 12:41.766
What do you know, you idiot?
You choked on a piece of gum today.

12:41.801 --> 12:43.935
Hey, man, don't shoot
the bike messenger.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.371
That is a terrible joke!

12:46.405 --> 12:48.406
And none of this makes any sense!

13:00.386 --> 13:02.320
Hey, Nick.

13:02.355 --> 13:04.322
(Sighs)
Look,

13:04.357 --> 13:06.892
I know you're really angry
and you have a right to be.

13:06.926 --> 13:08.393
I have the right to be?

13:08.427 --> 13:10.795
I mean, why do you feel
like you need to fix me?

13:10.830 --> 13:12.464
It's like you think you know better.

13:12.498 --> 13:15.467
Well, I m... I might know
better than you.

13:15.501 --> 13:17.669
(Scoffs)
Did you start a corporation?

13:19.338 --> 13:21.706
- Was it Fat Face?
- I think so.

13:21.741 --> 13:23.174
Yeah.

13:23.209 --> 13:24.809
Well, you're getting taxed like crazy.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.344
Well, that's because I thought
I was filing a patent.

13:26.379 --> 13:27.979
Fat Face is an invention?

13:28.014 --> 13:31.383
Kind of... in its intention
It was suppo... it... (Grunts)

13:31.417 --> 13:34.552
- Are you a lifeguard?
- No, that is a false certificate.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.254
Just a classic beach prank.

13:36.289 --> 13:37.389
That seems dangerous.

13:37.423 --> 13:39.591
It's funny, 'cause I...
I can't swim.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.237
Everyone was watching me, and
I'm like, "I don't know..."

13:42.395 --> 13:43.762
I was 13!

13:43.796 --> 13:45.130
I was 26.

13:45.164 --> 13:47.599
This is the problem with the box.
It's my private stuff.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.602
You've never once done
jury duty or paid your taxes.

13:50.636 --> 13:52.504
Not until gay marriage
is legal everywhere.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.607
I stand by that.

13:55.641 --> 13:58.376
And I don't want to do
jury duty or pay taxes.

13:58.411 --> 14:00.712
Nick, you're in so much debt,
it's crazy.

14:00.746 --> 14:04.783
- You have to deal with this stuff.
- No, I don't, Jess, it's in my box.

14:04.817 --> 14:05.850
That's not true, though.

14:05.885 --> 14:08.620
It's not a perfect system, Jess,

14:08.654 --> 14:11.156
but it's mine, okay?
And it's private.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.857
Well, I'm sorry I went
through your damn box,

14:12.892 --> 14:14.392
but I was just
trying to help you, Nick.

14:14.427 --> 14:15.727
So maybe I'll try to help you.

14:15.761 --> 14:17.362
What if I went into your box?

14:17.396 --> 14:18.730
Not that.

14:18.764 --> 14:21.599
- Stop it!
- I like that box, but I'm mad at you...!

14:21.634 --> 14:22.901
(Snaps fingers)

14:22.935 --> 14:25.036
I'm back to "You disrespected me."

14:25.071 --> 14:26.957
- I was just trying to help.
- Well, then, how about this...

14:26.992 --> 14:29.101
Two can help. Okay?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.242
And if two are going to help,
then I'll be one of them

14:31.277 --> 14:33.578
'cause two can tango
on this dance, okay?

14:33.612 --> 14:36.848
So, you want to waltz?
Well, you picked the wrong dance partner.

14:36.882 --> 14:38.183
Two can play.

14:38.217 --> 14:39.751
What? It's not a...

14:39.785 --> 14:42.554
Who needs changing, huh,
who needs fixing?

14:42.588 --> 14:44.889
I'm gonna go through
your personal drawers

14:44.924 --> 14:47.225
and see what needs changing.

14:50.629 --> 14:51.963
What are you, a zoo elephant?

14:51.998 --> 14:53.064
Those are my night peanuts.

14:53.099 --> 14:55.200
There shouldn't be day peanuts
and night peanuts!

14:55.234 --> 14:56.534
They're just peanuts!

14:56.569 --> 14:58.236
I'm sorry, why is that weird?

14:58.270 --> 15:00.638
You just have a bunch of boxes?
I would change that.

15:00.673 --> 15:04.242
- Oh, you have a bunch of metal toothpicks.
- They're bobby pins.

15:04.276 --> 15:06.211
- What's a bobby pin?
- It keeps your hair back.

15:06.245 --> 15:07.946
You need Bobby's pins
to put your hair up?

15:07.980 --> 15:10.749
It's bobby pins, not Bobby's pins.

15:10.783 --> 15:12.751
- What is this?!
- Yarn.

15:12.785 --> 15:14.419
What are you knitting,
a mansion?!

15:14.453 --> 15:16.654
Oh, look at this.
What do we have here?

15:16.689 --> 15:18.556
A bunch of beat-up old sacks.

15:18.591 --> 15:20.725
- My vintage purses.
- Well, you know what?

15:20.760 --> 15:24.229
- They could be sexier.
- You want my purses to be sexier?

15:24.263 --> 15:26.131
Would it kill you to
get something sleek,

15:26.165 --> 15:27.665
covered in gems for once?

15:27.700 --> 15:30.668
You want my purses
to be covered in gemstones?

15:30.703 --> 15:32.837
All guys do!
That's what we think is sexy!

15:32.872 --> 15:34.906
We want to be playing a
saxophone in an alley

15:34.940 --> 15:38.243
and have you walk by
in a miniskirt with a purse with gems.

15:38.277 --> 15:40.612
- But you girls don't listen!
- What?!

15:40.646 --> 15:42.914
- Changing!
- No! Nick, no!

15:42.948 --> 15:45.483
- This all is changing.
- No, no, stop! That's disrespectful!

15:45.518 --> 15:46.951
- Gone!
- Nick, stop it!

15:46.986 --> 15:49.654
No! This is the grossest thing
I've ever seen in my life!

15:49.688 --> 15:51.656
- I got that for a nickel.
- It's disgusting.

15:51.690 --> 15:53.258
You're just trying
to get a rise out of me.

15:53.292 --> 15:55.160
Oh, my God!

15:55.194 --> 15:57.228
I've gotten a lot
of compliments on that one.

15:57.263 --> 15:58.229
- Gone!
- Nick!

15:58.264 --> 15:59.697
What?

15:59.732 --> 16:02.333
Stop it! Look, I like you
the way you are.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.502
I'm just asking you to grow a little.

16:04.537 --> 16:08.139
Are we ever gonna get to a point
where you stop working on me?

16:08.174 --> 16:11.142
Instead of changing me,

16:11.177 --> 16:14.712
maybe once, Jess, see it my way.

16:14.747 --> 16:17.422
Well, your way's crazy and illegal.

16:17.457 --> 16:19.880
This is me, take it or leave it.

16:19.915 --> 16:22.656
I'm not changing for anyone.

16:25.858 --> 16:27.992
Hey, where are you going?

16:28.027 --> 16:29.494
If you have something to say,
just say it.

16:29.528 --> 16:30.895
Don't write me a note or...

16:30.930 --> 16:32.397
(Sighs)

16:33.933 --> 16:36.234
That's the money I spent.

16:36.268 --> 16:39.070
Do what you want with it.

16:39.105 --> 16:41.239
Thank you.

16:43.876 --> 16:46.144
Couple of best friend horses.
That's neat.

16:46.178 --> 16:48.179
What else can you get on...?

16:50.282 --> 16:52.851
(Sighs)

16:56.284 --> 16:57.618
It doesn't make any sense.

16:57.653 --> 17:00.288
Can you not see I'm in the middle
of a bar mitzvah class here?

17:00.322 --> 17:01.689
Yeah, well,
they should hear this.

17:01.723 --> 17:04.825
A man helping cancer kids
got creamed by a bus today.

17:04.859 --> 17:07.328
Everything happens for a reason.

17:07.362 --> 17:08.996
But what if it doesn't happen
for a reason?

17:09.031 --> 17:11.332
Maybe... Maybe there aren't
any good guys and bad guys.

17:11.366 --> 17:13.367
Maybe there are just winners and losers.

17:13.402 --> 17:15.536
I was beating myself up,
but maybe I should... (Laughs)

17:15.569 --> 17:17.505
Maybe I should have been celebrating.

17:17.539 --> 17:20.473
- Have you ever dated two women at once?
- What are you talking about?

17:20.509 --> 17:22.777
I went to camp...
They used to call me the Octopus.

17:22.810 --> 17:25.022
- Clearly, you have not, sir.
- That's enough.

17:25.061 --> 17:26.483
You get out of here right now!

17:26.515 --> 17:28.148
- Out.
- Don't you "out" me.

17:28.183 --> 17:29.817
- Get out, get...
- Getting a little handsy there, Rabbi.

17:29.851 --> 17:31.319
- Get out!
- You know what I realize?

17:31.353 --> 17:33.020
Nothing matters, and that's great.
You know why?

17:33.055 --> 17:35.821
Because if nothing matters,
we can do whatever we want, Rabbi.

17:35.856 --> 17:38.392
- (Laughter)
- Avram! Julio!

17:38.427 --> 17:39.560
Get away from me, man.

17:39.594 --> 17:40.861
Kick his ass!

17:40.896 --> 17:42.897
All right, okay.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.899
YOLO! YOLO!

17:44.933 --> 17:46.767
Nick's right.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.703
I have too many purses.

17:48.737 --> 17:50.137
You're addicted to purses.

17:50.172 --> 17:53.741
I'm addicted to development fluid.
I get it.

17:53.775 --> 17:56.143
This one's for meat,
and this one's for shells.

17:56.178 --> 17:57.745
You know what?

17:57.779 --> 18:01.215
- Keep them. They're yours.
- Okay, thanks.

18:01.249 --> 18:03.050
Also, heads up...
The ass of your pants is missing.

18:03.085 --> 18:04.719
It's for the kitty cats.

18:04.753 --> 18:06.821
(Phone ringing)

18:06.855 --> 18:08.656
- My phone's ringing.
- Sure.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.091
- (Laughs)
- Hello?

18:10.125 --> 18:12.626
I'm like a pretty lady.

18:12.661 --> 18:14.995
What's happening?

18:15.030 --> 18:16.497
I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Day,

18:16.531 --> 18:18.466
but this man was trying
to open an account

18:18.500 --> 18:21.435
with a check in your name
and a paper bag full of money.

18:21.470 --> 18:23.938
Would you please stop hovering?
I'm being cooperative.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.139
It's fine. He's okay.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.407
Thank you, though.

18:29.311 --> 18:31.645
Opening a bank account, huh?

18:31.680 --> 18:33.581
Yeah, I, uh...

18:33.615 --> 18:35.716
- I realized something.
- What?

18:35.751 --> 18:39.587
I'd do anything for you, Jess.

18:39.621 --> 18:42.022
Hey.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.727
Thank you.

18:46.762 --> 18:50.498
All right, Mr. Miller,
your checking account is good to go.

18:50.532 --> 18:52.867
Oh, there's just
an eight dollar processing fee.

18:52.901 --> 18:53.634
Eight dollars?

18:53.668 --> 18:56.736
That's a very specific amount.

19:00.776 --> 19:03.144
That's fine...
It's your world, your rules, so...

19:03.178 --> 19:04.211
Excellent.

19:04.246 --> 19:06.580
You go to the castle,
you got to pay the king.

19:09.618 --> 19:12.486
What is processing?
What does that mean?

19:12.521 --> 19:15.990
It's just a word you use
to make more money off of us.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.125
- That makes me mad!
- Me, too, yeah.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.294
Hey, how about this?
What's a bank?

19:20.328 --> 19:21.662
- Yeah.
- It's just a paper bag...

19:21.696 --> 19:23.364
- That's right. Yes!
- ...with walls.

19:23.398 --> 19:26.367
You're making some really,
really, really good points, ma'am.

19:26.401 --> 19:28.969
You are the puppeteers
that puppet the world.

19:29.004 --> 19:30.171
NICK:
No more banks!

19:30.205 --> 19:31.505
Or some banks... I don't care!

19:31.540 --> 19:33.174
But I want my money on a boat!

19:33.208 --> 19:34.608
JESS:
I understood at least 30%

19:34.643 --> 19:36.010
of the financial crisis,

19:36.044 --> 19:37.445
and guess what I got from that?

19:37.479 --> 19:39.747
- You... suck!
- Yeah.

19:39.781 --> 19:42.116
You suck so hard.

19:42.150 --> 19:44.518
And now, I'm gonna process
this man's face,

19:44.553 --> 19:46.654
'cause I think he's great.

19:46.688 --> 19:49.657
And I'm crazy about him.

19:51.159 --> 19:53.027
Fine, I'll waive the fee.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.695
Yeah!

19:54.729 --> 19:56.630
We won eight dollars!

19:56.665 --> 19:58.098
Just wait till you have children.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.401
(Bitter laugh)
You'll never touch each other again.

20:00.435 --> 20:03.504
- (Wry laugh)
- JESS: Banks suck! Banks suck!

20:03.538 --> 20:04.472
(Nick guffaws)

20:07.208 --> 20:08.742
What the hell happened to you?

20:08.776 --> 20:11.078
Got beat up by some rabbis.

20:11.112 --> 20:13.747
Well, Winston, we're all alone.

20:13.781 --> 20:16.016
Nothing matters.

20:16.050 --> 20:17.884
But you know what?
Look Schmidt, stop, all right?

20:17.919 --> 20:19.653
You're a good man.

20:19.687 --> 20:22.155
You did a bad thing...
doesn't make you bad.

20:22.190 --> 20:25.692
We just have to try to be better,
you know?

20:25.727 --> 20:28.729
Been waiting all day for
somebody to tell me that.

20:28.763 --> 20:31.698
I... I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

20:31.733 --> 20:33.300
I want you to have something.

20:33.334 --> 20:35.669
Winston, literally,
a gift is the last thing I des...

20:37.672 --> 20:39.740
- This is...
- There you go.

20:39.774 --> 20:42.009
This is a candelabra.

20:42.043 --> 20:43.477
Yeah.

20:43.511 --> 20:45.545
I bought it with the money
that Nick owed me.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.814
- This is what you spent it on?
- And now it's yours.

20:47.849 --> 20:51.084
Uh-huh.
May it illuminate your path

20:51.119 --> 20:53.854
and lead you...
out of the darkness.

20:53.888 --> 20:56.556
That's what it says on the bottom.

20:56.591 --> 20:59.026
May it illuminate your path,
lead you out of darkness.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.895
Uh, uh, thank you for this... really.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.564
Look at it every single day
and tell yourself...

21:04.599 --> 21:07.234
"I'm a good person," 'cause you are.

21:07.268 --> 21:08.535
You know what I might do, though?

21:08.569 --> 21:10.203
And it might seem like
the opposite, but...

21:10.238 --> 21:11.338
what I'm actually thinking is,

21:11.372 --> 21:12.906
maybe I'll just put it
away somewhere, like in...

21:12.940 --> 21:14.775
I don't know...
in the back of my closet...

21:14.809 --> 21:16.176
so to keep it away from thieves.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.744
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:17.779 --> 21:19.179
- Can you be honest with me real quick?
- Mm-hmm.

21:19.213 --> 21:21.581
How many times did you rub this thing
and think a genie was gonna come out?

21:21.616 --> 21:23.050
I ain't gonna lie to you man.

21:23.084 --> 21:24.818
- I rubbed it, like, three times.
- Yeah.

21:24.852 --> 21:26.473
- I thought so.
- You know, I'm not...

21:26.508 --> 21:29.028
If a genie did come out,
what would you wish for?

21:29.431 --> 21:31.983
- More candelabras.
- Yeah, I bet.
