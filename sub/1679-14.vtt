00:01.116 --> 00:04.300
Kids, I told you stories
about all the big holidays--

00:04.418 --> 00:05.649
Christmas...

00:06.162 --> 00:07.367
Halloween...

00:08.293 --> 00:09.548
Thanksgiving...

00:10.802 --> 00:13.279
but one holiday was
always my favorite--

00:13.289 --> 00:15.043
Super Bowl Sunday.

00:15.053 --> 00:17.864
And there was one
Super Bowl back in 2007

00:17.874 --> 00:19.524
that I will never forget.

00:19.534 --> 00:21.087
Marshall, you're
on beer detail.

00:21.095 --> 00:22.980
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.

00:22.993 --> 00:25.099
Uh, Robin,
you're on chips and pretzels,

00:25.103 --> 00:26.770
and Barney,
I'm giving you nothing to do

00:26.787 --> 00:29.611
so you can just focus on
controlling your gambling problem.

00:29.789 --> 00:31.093
"Problem."

00:31.247 --> 00:33.362
Oh, poor Superman,
he should really do something

00:33.376 --> 00:35.431
about his flying problem.

00:35.447 --> 00:38.263
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.

00:38.607 --> 00:42.341
And I will be going to Quinn's to
pick up the world's greatest food,

00:42.358 --> 00:44.612
the Super Bowl
Hot Wings Platter.

00:44.826 --> 00:47.493
If I were a chicken,
I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.

00:47.508 --> 00:49.341
Just eat my own damn wing off.
I don't care.

00:49.358 --> 00:51.293
I'm crazy like that.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.983
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.

00:53.997 --> 00:55.161
What's tomorrow night?

00:55.176 --> 00:57.681
Oh, God, you didn't hear?

00:58.077 --> 00:59.571
Mark died.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.512
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:02.525 --> 01:04.272
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,
and I know

01:04.287 --> 01:06.722
it would have meant a
lot to Mark if you came.

01:06.927 --> 01:09.632
You guys were his
favorite customers.

01:10.148 --> 01:13.160
- Stay strong.
- We're so sorry.

01:15.277 --> 01:17.411
Who was Mark?

01:17.427 --> 01:19.760
- No idea.
- Not a clue.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.730
Well, I guess we
should go, right?

01:24.328 --> 01:28.022
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the Super Bowl.

01:28.808 --> 01:31.902
Okay, I feel terrible,
but the truth is we didn't know Mike.

01:31.918 --> 01:32.772
- Mark.
- Mark,

01:32.788 --> 01:34.823
and as long as we send flowers,

01:34.835 --> 01:36.990
I can't think of any
reason we'd have to go.

01:37.008 --> 01:38.253
Get out of here!

01:38.265 --> 01:41.062
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!

01:43.015 --> 01:46.750
This soulless bastard just told me
he can't come to Mark's funeral

01:46.768 --> 01:48.972
because he wants to
watch the Super Bowl.

01:48.985 --> 01:50.870
Could you believe that?

01:52.447 --> 01:54.283
You guys are coming, right?

01:54.295 --> 01:56.453
Yes... Wouldn't
miss for the world.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.505 --> 02:11.211
Okay, here's the plan :

02:11.227 --> 02:13.382
record the game,
go to the funeral,

02:13.398 --> 02:15.143
- pay our respects to Matt...
- Mark.

02:15.156 --> 02:18.512
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.

02:18.948 --> 02:21.731
Okay, that's great,
but just to make sure it records,

02:21.748 --> 02:23.510
maybe we should bow our
heads and say a quiet prayer

02:23.547 --> 02:25.162
to the TiVo gods.

02:27.818 --> 02:29.493
Almighty TiVo,

02:29.915 --> 02:32.590
we thank you for all the
gifts you have given us:

02:32.605 --> 02:34.913
the power to freeze live
TV to go take a leak

02:34.927 --> 02:36.791
is nothing short of Godlike.

02:37.395 --> 02:40.071
Let's not forget fast-forwarding
through commercials.

02:40.398 --> 02:43.031
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,

02:43.046 --> 02:44.942
O magic box,

02:45.007 --> 02:48.843
but if you malfunction
and miss the Super Bowl,

02:48.857 --> 02:51.372
we will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.

02:51.385 --> 02:52.641
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:52.658 --> 02:54.971
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.

02:54.986 --> 02:56.160
Yeah, they're the best part.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.050
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?

02:58.067 --> 03:01.511
Who wants to watch a monkey in
a coconut bra order a pizza?

03:01.588 --> 03:03.960
Oh, my God.
This monkey was so cute.

03:05.365 --> 03:08.031
Seriously, that's the last
time I'm gonna call you today.

03:08.048 --> 03:09.202
Okay.

03:09.216 --> 03:10.870
G ood-bye.

03:11.395 --> 03:13.123
You didn't hang up either!

03:13.138 --> 03:14.983
I know! You hang up!

03:14.998 --> 03:16.580
You hang up!

03:18.237 --> 03:20.153
My bookie. Great guy.

03:20.656 --> 03:23.703
So let me get this straight. A funeral
is the one time you don't suit up?

03:23.717 --> 03:25.652
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?

03:25.666 --> 03:26.933
Virtually.

03:26.946 --> 03:29.013
Suits are full of joy.

03:29.027 --> 03:32.391
They're the sartorial
equivalent of a baby's smile.

03:32.406 --> 03:33.491
"Sartorial"?

03:33.507 --> 03:35.573
"Of or pertaining to
tailors or their trade."

03:35.585 --> 03:37.450
Suits are for the living.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.122
That's why when it's
my time to R.I.P.

03:39.137 --> 03:41.330
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it--

03:41.365 --> 03:43.752
buck naked. Yeah.

03:43.767 --> 03:45.181
It's gonna be awesome.

03:45.195 --> 03:48.323
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.

03:48.337 --> 03:50.032
What up?!

04:21.696 --> 04:23.680
- Such a waste.
- I know.

04:23.695 --> 04:25.242
He was so young.

04:25.257 --> 04:28.662
A hand-stitched, cashmere,
double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.

04:28.678 --> 04:30.732
It must be so frightened.

04:31.235 --> 04:33.021
This is going faster
than I thought.

04:33.037 --> 04:35.013
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,

04:35.028 --> 04:36.992
we'll be watching
the game by 8:00.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.601
And even though we
didn't see any whales,

04:39.615 --> 04:43.041
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.

04:43.808 --> 04:46.213
Okay, I'm getting
us another round.

04:46.227 --> 04:48.043
And when I come back,

04:48.058 --> 04:51.033
everyone else is telling
their favorite Mark story.

04:53.897 --> 04:56.103
Dibs on the one Carl just told.

04:56.685 --> 05:00.291
Okay, I have to be at work
exactly one Super Bowl from now.

05:00.306 --> 05:02.281
Oh, let's face it,
we're not going to get to watch it.

05:02.316 --> 05:03.960
We should just find
out the score.

05:03.977 --> 05:05.421
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.

05:05.437 --> 05:08.103
No, no, no, we can't!
We have to watch the game together.

05:08.116 --> 05:09.361
It's tradition.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.312
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.

05:12.327 --> 05:15.100
Second down, everyone drink.

05:15.878 --> 05:17.682
Ted, it's not a drinking game

05:17.695 --> 05:20.132
if you drink anytime
anything happens.

05:20.148 --> 05:22.383
Are these chicken
wings or angel wings?

05:22.396 --> 05:24.322
God, I love these things.

05:24.796 --> 05:26.470
I love you guys.

05:26.485 --> 05:30.091
This is so great, all of us
watching the Super Bowl together.

05:30.108 --> 05:32.152
This is special.

05:33.215 --> 05:35.950
We need to do this every year--
promise me!

05:35.965 --> 05:37.441
Calm down, buddy.

05:37.478 --> 05:39.071
Oh, commercials!

05:39.087 --> 05:40.793
Everyone drink!

05:43.608 --> 05:47.593
God, this is such a great tradition,
all of us watching the game together.

05:47.605 --> 05:49.340
How did this start?

05:49.355 --> 05:52.222
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks
that Casey misses this field goal.

05:52.237 --> 05:54.703
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.

05:54.715 --> 05:57.392
Make it like a dollar or something,
you know. Who cares? No big deal.

05:57.427 --> 05:59.103
Fine.

06:00.135 --> 06:02.771
See, there you go, he made it.
You win.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.763
Wait. This is mine, 
just like that?

06:05.887 --> 06:08.072
God, that feels good.

06:08.086 --> 06:10.812
No, that feels really... good.

06:10.826 --> 06:12.233
What else can we bet on?

06:12.247 --> 06:14.323
Nothing, it's the
halftime show.

06:14.335 --> 06:17.053
Oh, so lame.

06:17.065 --> 06:18.772
Nobody even pays attention.

06:18.786 --> 06:21.611
I mean, Janet Jackson,
who cares?

06:25.818 --> 06:27.890
God, how cool is Robin?

06:27.905 --> 06:30.640
I can't believe you invited this girl
we've only known for a few months

06:30.678 --> 06:32.251
to  our sacred day.

06:32.265 --> 06:33.951
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.

06:33.965 --> 06:35.563
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the Seahawks

06:35.605 --> 06:37.380
plus six points for 500 bucks.

06:37.395 --> 06:39.450
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

06:39.463 --> 06:41.369
$50?! What fun is $50?!

06:41.373 --> 06:44.580
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, Marshall!

06:44.597 --> 06:45.901
Okay, $50.

06:45.919 --> 06:47.183
Hey, I'll take that action.

06:47.196 --> 06:49.540
Seahawks, but make it four
points and make it a grand.

06:49.555 --> 06:52.400
Hey, these wings,
are they chicken wings or angel wings?

06:52.416 --> 06:53.680
Oh, commercials!

06:53.698 --> 06:56.790
Monkey with a coconut
bra. Hilarious.

06:58.046 --> 07:00.593
Look, we always watch
the Super Bowl together.

07:00.607 --> 07:03.323
So we make a pact to
watch it tomorrow at 6:00

07:03.335 --> 07:05.992
and go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.

07:06.007 --> 07:07.690
That's impossible.

07:07.705 --> 07:09.821
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

07:09.836 --> 07:12.483
That means no TV, no Internet,

07:12.498 --> 07:14.240
no newspapers, nothing.

07:14.258 --> 07:15.931
Media blackout.

07:15.945 --> 07:17.662
But our tradition lives on.

07:17.677 --> 07:19.332
Who's in?

07:20.047 --> 07:21.452
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.303
- I'm in.
- What the hell, I'm in.

07:23.315 --> 07:26.390
- High five!
- Dude, we're at a wake.

07:26.408 --> 07:29.322
Sorry. Solemn low five.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.001
As the day began, none of us had
any idea how hard it would be

07:35.015 --> 07:38.460
to go nine hours without hearing
the outcome of the Super Bowl.

07:38.476 --> 07:40.903
I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination

07:40.916 --> 07:43.021
by the outside world.

07:47.155 --> 07:50.442
Hey,  take this key
and swallow it.

07:50.455 --> 07:51.531
What? No.

07:51.545 --> 07:54.331
Come on, Ted, you eat salads.
It'll be out by game time.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.112
Lots more, no.

07:56.128 --> 07:57.763
I'm not messing
around, Theodore.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.300
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.

08:00.316 --> 08:02.461
If I don't handcuff
myself to this radiator,

08:02.478 --> 08:04.750
I'll check the score.
Please take the key.

08:04.768 --> 08:05.860
Fine.

08:05.878 --> 08:07.690
But only because you didn't
think through a bathroom plan

08:07.725 --> 08:09.822
and I think that's funny.

08:18.545 --> 08:21.191
The media blackout was
particularly hard on Robin

08:21.207 --> 08:23.762
because, well,
she was the media.

08:23.776 --> 08:26.053
But unfortunately,
the City won't be fixing

08:26.065 --> 08:28.540
the unusually large
pothole any time soon,

08:28.555 --> 08:31.310
so buckle up if
you're on the BQE.

08:31.326 --> 08:33.260
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

08:33.275 --> 08:35.820
Like morning commutes
needed to get any harder.

08:35.835 --> 08:37.472
You're right, Kevin.

08:37.775 --> 08:41.001
Well, Robin, what do you say?
I think it's time to check in with Sid

08:41.018 --> 08:43.202
- for a sports update.
- No!

08:43.424 --> 08:45.790
- What?
- No.

08:46.065 --> 08:48.640
But it's, uh, time for Sports.

08:48.658 --> 08:52.523
No, it's not.
It's time for Weather.

08:52.535 --> 08:54.813
We, we just did Weather.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.173
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

08:57.185 --> 08:58.412
it may have changed.

08:58.426 --> 09:00.791
What's it doing out there, Lou?

09:02.778 --> 09:06.541
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.

09:06.595 --> 09:08.701
Back to you, Robin.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.271
Okay, now it's time for Sports.

09:13.288 --> 09:16.162
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd

09:16.175 --> 09:18.213
in the Metro News
1 Gridlock Chopper.

09:18.227 --> 09:20.230
Robin, it's time for Sports!

09:22.958 --> 09:24.841
Over to you, Sid.

09:25.235 --> 09:28.650
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.

09:28.665 --> 09:31.302
Let's talk about
the Super Bowl.

09:31.798 --> 09:33.752
Weeks earlier,
Marshall had promised Lily

09:33.767 --> 09:36.730
he'd come into her kindergarten
class for show-and-tell day.

09:36.748 --> 09:39.212
And he's a little
bit double-jointed...

09:39.706 --> 09:42.870
And his favorite animal
is the Loch Ness monster.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.612
Lily, how many times...?

09:44.628 --> 09:46.383
Nessie is a gentle creature.

09:46.395 --> 09:49.322
We're trying to stay away
from terms like "Monster."

09:49.806 --> 09:53.351
Well, I think we can all agree,
he is much more interesting

09:53.366 --> 09:55.640
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.

09:55.658 --> 09:58.243
Three weeks in a row?
Come on, Sally.

09:58.956 --> 10:01.523
Okay, well,
that's all the time we have.

10:01.538 --> 10:03.493
Arts and crafts, everybody.

10:06.246 --> 10:08.930
Hey. I'm Doug.

10:08.948 --> 10:11.102
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.571
Are you going to be staying 
here for the rest of day?

10:15.587 --> 10:17.482
Yeah, I'm actually
trying to hide out

10:17.495 --> 10:19.812
'cause I don't want to know
who won the Super Bowl.

10:19.825 --> 10:21.760
I know who won.

10:21.775 --> 10:24.450
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,

10:24.466 --> 10:26.733
so if you could just
keep that to yourself.

10:26.898 --> 10:30.663
How badly do you
not want to know?

10:31.348 --> 10:32.741
Excuse me?

10:32.756 --> 10:34.733
Ten  bucks.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.322
Are  you serious?

10:36.337 --> 10:38.581
Just went up to eight.

10:39.245 --> 10:40.820
Unlock me, Ted.

10:40.835 --> 10:43.141
I've never gone this long
without calling my bookie.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.633
He worries.

10:45.536 --> 10:47.252
Not until game time.

10:48.016 --> 10:49.432
Where are you going?

10:49.445 --> 10:50.790
Pick up the hot wings.

10:50.805 --> 10:53.420
What? How the hell are
you planning on getting

10:53.435 --> 10:55.720
in and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.940
There's TVs everywhere.

10:56.958 --> 10:58.483
Ah, don't worry.

10:58.498 --> 10:59.992
I got it all planned out.

11:00.005 --> 11:01.491
First of all:

11:01.506 --> 11:03.740
I placed duct tape on
a pair of sunglasses

11:03.757 --> 11:06.162
so I can only see out
of two tiny holes.

11:06.177 --> 11:09.963
Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.

11:09.975 --> 11:12.803
Top it all off:
high-tech noise-reducing headphones

11:12.817 --> 11:14.820
I bought when Marshall and
Lily first got back together

11:14.856 --> 11:16.362
and were doing it a lot.

11:16.377 --> 11:20.173
I call it the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

11:43.038 --> 11:45.602
Hello! Uh,
my name is Ted Mosby.

11:45.615 --> 11:47.423
I'm here to pick
up my hot wings.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.783
In my hand, you'll find the
exact total for the wings

11:49.796 --> 11:51.730
plus a generous tip.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.342
Please take the cash.

11:53.357 --> 11:56.443
Put the wings in my hand
and I'll be on my way.

11:58.305 --> 11:59.970
Thank you!

12:04.435 --> 12:08.332
And that closes the book on
one heck of a Super Bowl.

12:08.348 --> 12:10.361
Back to you, Kevin and Robin.

12:14.138 --> 12:16.440
We'll be right back.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.270
And we're clear.

12:19.288 --> 12:20.661
I'm sorry.

12:20.677 --> 12:22.290
Um, Robin, is it just me,

12:22.307 --> 12:23.770
or were you doing
something different there?

12:23.806 --> 12:25.723
I haven't watched the game yet.

12:25.735 --> 12:27.251
I'm begging you,
for the rest of the newscast

12:27.285 --> 12:30.042
there can't be any references
to who won the Super Bowl.

12:30.056 --> 12:31.752
I mean,
change the teleprompter.

12:31.768 --> 12:33.851
No team names,
nothing specific.

12:33.868 --> 12:36.370
That is crazy. I can't do that.

12:37.275 --> 12:40.360
My friend Mark passed
away this week.

12:40.376 --> 12:42.883
Okay, sweety okay.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.821
Back in five... four...

12:44.838 --> 12:46.792
- three...
- It's just so hard.

13:14.178 --> 13:17.270
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!

13:17.288 --> 13:20.541
You said the Sensory
Deprivator 5000 was stupid.

13:20.556 --> 13:22.141
But it totally worked!

13:22.157 --> 13:24.881
I couldn't see or hear
anything happening around me.

13:24.895 --> 13:27.230
Right?! Right?!

13:28.548 --> 13:30.162
No...!

13:31.507 --> 13:33.200
And if that weren't bad enough,

13:33.217 --> 13:35.720
I was about to have a
horrible realization.

13:35.738 --> 13:37.622
Where's the dipping sauce?

13:40.526 --> 13:43.422
The team that won, want to know
what their name rhymes with?

13:43.435 --> 13:45.390
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop

13:45.408 --> 13:47.363
if I ate all those crayons.

13:47.377 --> 13:49.381
Why are you doing this?

13:50.216 --> 13:52.601
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.

13:53.287 --> 13:56.801
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin,
she's mine.

14:05.036 --> 14:07.530
Okay, now who did this?

14:11.656 --> 14:13.252
I did.

14:13.268 --> 14:16.083
Does that mean Marshall
gets a time-out?

14:16.345 --> 14:19.133
Well, Marshall's
a grownup, so...

14:19.146 --> 14:22.221
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.

14:24.305 --> 14:25.883
Sorry.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.762
And after the Super Bowl,

14:33.778 --> 14:36.632
the mayor of the losing
team's city had to pay up,

14:36.647 --> 14:38.562
sending the mayor of
the winning team's city

14:38.578 --> 14:43.031
15 pounds of a delicacy his
or her city is famous for.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.601
Better fire up whatever type of grill,
steamer or fryer

14:46.616 --> 14:51.163
one might use to cook that delicacy,
Winning Team's Mayor.

14:51.827 --> 14:53.180
Hey.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.372
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.

14:56.388 --> 14:57.641
Yes, you are.

14:57.656 --> 14:59.541
You'll do whatever I say.

14:59.558 --> 15:02.350
- Hold your breath.
- I'm not holding my breath.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.213
The winning team was the...

15:04.927 --> 15:07.281
Now here's how this
is going to work:

15:07.297 --> 15:10.463
you're going to take me to
three R-rated movies a week...

15:10.475 --> 15:12.472
And then Uncle
Marshall got an idea.

15:12.487 --> 15:14.651
It was not one he was
proud of in retrospect,

15:14.667 --> 15:16.791
but desperate times...

15:21.115 --> 15:23.062
Oh, no.

15:23.076 --> 15:25.353
Somebody wet their pants.

15:25.366 --> 15:26.851
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

15:26.867 --> 15:28.131
Who's everyone gonna believe?

15:28.146 --> 15:30.251
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at Columbia

15:30.267 --> 15:33.770
and you're just a little pants wetter.
So now I ask you a question:

15:33.786 --> 15:36.740
You want to be able to quietly sneak
off to the restroom and dry off

15:36.755 --> 15:39.502
or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?

15:39.765 --> 15:42.160
- Hey, everyone...
- Okay, okay.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.913
You win.

15:43.926 --> 15:45.712
I want my money back.

15:49.065 --> 15:51.771
And your pudding snack pack.

15:56.358 --> 15:58.332
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?

15:58.347 --> 15:59.942
Sorry. I missed the game.

15:59.955 --> 16:01.590
You missed...?!
How could he miss...?

16:01.606 --> 16:03.382
Excuse me!
Who won the Super Bowl?!

16:03.396 --> 16:05.421
I... don't really
follow sports.

16:05.435 --> 16:06.971
Oh, my...!

16:08.335 --> 16:10.211
Emmitt Smith!

16:10.226 --> 16:11.893
Oh, thank God.

16:11.908 --> 16:13.493
Yeah, I get that a lot.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.022
You got to tell me,
who won the Super Bowl?

16:16.035 --> 16:18.252
The game was last night?

16:18.636 --> 16:21.220
You know, once you win two
or three of those things,

16:21.237 --> 16:23.872
it's kind of like, eh.

16:23.985 --> 16:26.812
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a
football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.

16:26.847 --> 16:30.092
What could possibly be more
important than football?!

16:30.508 --> 16:34.313
Dance, my friend. Dance.

16:36.458 --> 16:39.643
No...!

16:57.877 --> 17:00.240
Hello! It's me again.

17:00.258 --> 17:03.193
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

17:03.206 --> 17:06.470
Yeah, you forgot to give
me the dipping sauce!

17:10.156 --> 17:12.432
Ah. Yes.

17:12.446 --> 17:13.800
This is the one.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.602
It was 4:00, and so far,
all of us had done the impossible.

17:17.615 --> 17:20.482
But then,
almost simultaneously,

17:20.496 --> 17:22.222
things started to go wrong.

17:22.237 --> 17:24.382
And let's end the
day on a happy note.

17:24.397 --> 17:26.340
There is a new arrival
at the Bronx Zoo.

17:26.355 --> 17:29.042
Trish Sanchez has the story.

17:40.245 --> 17:42.631
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude, look out.

17:44.025 --> 17:47.202
And in honor of
yesterday's big win...

17:55.725 --> 17:57.683
- Hey, buddy, look out.
- Dude, watch out!

17:59.835 --> 18:02.151
...the zoo decided to
name the baby panda

18:02.166 --> 18:04.281
after Super Bowl champions...

18:04.295 --> 18:05.710
No...!

18:07.138 --> 18:08.892
No...!

18:09.208 --> 18:11.313
No...!

18:22.056 --> 18:24.181
Yes...!

18:29.626 --> 18:31.411
Awesome. Just in
time for kick-off.

18:31.427 --> 18:33.201
None of you guys found 
out the score, right?

18:33.217 --> 18:35.010
- Mission accomplished.
- Didn't find out.

18:35.025 --> 18:37.433
Great. Let's do it.
I already fast-forwarded

18:37.445 --> 18:40.970
through the four hours of pre-game
coverage. So we are ready.

18:41.727 --> 18:43.823
Barney, I can't
even look at you.

18:43.838 --> 18:45.541
I don't want any
sign of who won.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.253
Don't worry,
I'm not going to give anything away.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.043
Feel free to start without me.

18:51.367 --> 18:55.013
Ah...!  Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

18:55.028 --> 18:57.040
So much money!
You screwed it up, Barney!

18:57.055 --> 19:00.353
You screwed everything up!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

19:00.957 --> 19:02.930
Okay, let's watch the game.

19:02.977 --> 19:05.792
Barney, what the hell was that?
We know who you bet on.

19:05.907 --> 19:08.141
Now you've ruined the
game for everyone.

19:08.197 --> 19:10.772
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.

19:10.787 --> 19:11.920
Way to blow it.

19:11.938 --> 19:14.652
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.

19:15.158 --> 19:17.702
There's no point in
even watching the game.

19:24.637 --> 19:26.883
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.610
Wings are still good.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.402
Beer still works.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.603
Ah, what the hell.

19:34.617 --> 19:36.701
Let's watch Barney
lose some money.

19:38.047 --> 19:39.302
Hey, so check this out:

19:39.318 --> 19:41.932
I got extorted by a
five-year-old today.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.211
I almost got fired today.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.673
I met Emmitt Smith today.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.833
Ooh, you go first.

19:46.845 --> 19:49.213
I tried out the Sensory
Deprivator 5000.

19:49.226 --> 19:50.993
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.532
Well, I was frantically
running down the street

19:53.545 --> 19:55.392
trying to find out the
score to the game...

19:55.405 --> 19:56.901
And here's the funny part,

19:56.915 --> 19:59.331
as unforgettable as
that Super Bowl was,

19:59.345 --> 20:03.312
here it is 23 years later and
I don't remember who won...

20:03.326 --> 20:05.741
Hell, I don't even
remember who played.

20:05.758 --> 20:08.322
What I do remember is
that we drank beer,

20:08.345 --> 20:11.351
we ate wings and we watched
the Super Bowl together.

20:13.356 --> 20:16.492
Because sometimes, even if you know
how something's going to end,

20:16.518 --> 20:19.080
that doesn't mean you
can't enjoy the ride.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.802
We even raised a toast
to good old Mike.

20:21.826 --> 20:23.810
I mean Mark. Matt.

20:23.866 --> 20:25.921
Crap! Why do I keep doing that?

20:27.938 --> 20:32.991
I didn't only lose the game,
I lost every single prop bet.

20:33.005 --> 20:36.500
Total penalty yardage,
number of replay-challenges,

20:36.516 --> 20:37.570
coin toss...

20:37.587 --> 20:40.012
What are the odds of
losing the coin toss?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.883
50-50, give or take.

20:42.258 --> 20:46.252
Interceptions, field-goals,
total sacks,

20:46.307 --> 20:49.451
whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...
