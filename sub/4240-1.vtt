11:50.794 --> 11:53.170
Deal.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.384
You put your hands
in the corners like this.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.928
Okay?
I can't do it.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.638
I'm dyslexic.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.808
Maybe I should just stick to
towels and washcloths.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.894
Howard, if you can't fold
a fitted sheet, you cannot
work at Sheets 'N' Things.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.397
[Bell Dings]
[Man]
Associate return.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.233
Go. Make sure
they have a receipt.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.946
Someone looks beautiful
today. Hi.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.198
You look very handsome.
Thank you.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.284
Roast beef on pumpernickel.
Your favorite.
Ohh!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.620
Oh, does it have mayo?
Yeah.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.540
Will, if my diabetes comes back,
I can't get pregnant.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.792
I-
What is wrong with you?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
[Sighs]
Well, I wanted
to tell you...

12:33.878 --> 12:37.047
that I'm gonna
have to start workin' late
for the next couple months.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.925
I'm, uh, monitoring
after-school detention.
What?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.928
I had to make a deal
with Figgins so he wouldn't
kill Glee Club.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.014
But, Will, I'm on my feet
four hours a day,
three times a week here.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.642
Now I have to go home
and I have to cook dinner
for myself?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.854
[Scoffs]
This lady wants to
return these sheets.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.982
But something tells me
we've got another
bed wetter.

12:55.066 --> 13:00.070
[Sighs]
Do you see what I have to
deal with here, hmm?

13:01.156 --> 13:02.906
God, hasn't she ever
heard of a diaper?

13:02.991 --> 13:06.326
[Sandy]
Of course towels
have a thread count, Mr...

13:06.411 --> 13:08.537
Sheets 'N' Things!

13:08.621 --> 13:11.707
What do you do?
I read catalogs!
I know these things.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.794
Anything under
a 400-thread count and
I could break out in impetigo!

13:15.879 --> 13:19.047
It's simple to understand!
William?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.049
Sandy? Hey!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.760
Well, hello.
How are things?

13:23.845 --> 13:26.597
I hear you have
taken over Glee Club.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.475
Yeah.
I hope you're not too upset.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.060
Are you kidding?
Getting out of that
swirling eddy of despair-

13:32.145 --> 13:34.021
best thing that ever
happened to me.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.939
[Whistles]
[Chuckles]

13:36.024 --> 13:39.026
Don't get me wrong.
It wasn't easy at first.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.987
Being dismissed.
And for what I was
accused of?

13:42.071 --> 13:45.616
My long-distance girlfriend
in Cleveland nearly
broke up with me.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.243
Oh, God. Don't you
love a good monkey?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.038
It took me weeks to get over
my nervous breakdown.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.583
Did they put you
on medication?
Better. Medical marijuana.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.835
It's genius!

13:56.920 --> 13:59.713
I just tell my Dr. Feelgood
I'm having trouble sleeping,

13:59.797 --> 14:02.299
and he gives me
all of it I want.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.593
I'm finding
the whole system
quite lucrative.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.597
You're a drug dealer?
Oh, yeah. Make five times more
than when I was a teacher.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.935
I keep some for myself
and then I take
money baths in the rest.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.728
Who-Who do you sell it to?

14:19.442 --> 14:22.277
You want in?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.279
Uh, no.
[Chuckles]
I tried it once in college.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.240
But Terri and I are
trying to get pregnant.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.575
I do my own packaging.
Sandy, no—

14:28.660 --> 14:30.452
And the first sample
is free. Come on.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.705
You are the one coaching
those tone-deaf acne factories.
You're gonna need it.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.458
What?
This looks like barf.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.794
Okay? I have to
do everything myself.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.879
Call me.
Come on.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.675
What's the matter
with you?
Scary.

14:44.759 --> 14:48.303
[Knocking]
Hey, Sue.
C-Can I have a sec?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.182
Sure, buddy. Come on in.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.940
Eew!
[Gasping]

15:01.734 --> 15:03.819
Hey, Emma.
You got a second?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.862
- What is that? Gum?
- Uh-huh.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.574
So you want to talk
to my Cheerios
about joining Glee Club?

15:08.658 --> 15:10.367
Well, I need more kids-
Performers.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.536
And all the best ones
are in the Cheerios.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.538
I figured some of them
might want to double up.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.166
Okay.
So what you're doing right now
is called blurring the lines.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.712
High school is a caste system.
Kids fall into certain slots.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.549
Your jocks,
your popular kids,
up in the penthouse.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.470
The invisibles and the kids
playing live-action druids
and trolls out in the forest,

15:30.555 --> 15:32.472
bottom floor.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.600
And... where do
the Glee kids lie?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.810
Sub-basement.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.730
Sue's not wrong.
But I don't think anything's
set in stone.

15:39.814 --> 15:44.026
I mean, kids are gonna do
what they think is cool, which
is not always who they are.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.446
You just need to find a way to
get them out of their boxes.
Well, how do I do that?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.699
They follow the leader.
If you can get a couple of
the popular kids to sign up,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.409
the rest will fall
right in line.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.454
I just want to
talk to them.
I don't know, dude.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.206
I can't see any of my guys
wanting to join the Glee Club.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.709
Last month, they held down
one of their teammates,
shaved off his eyebrows...

16:00.793 --> 16:02.711
just because he
watched Grey's Anatomy.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.423
Look, all I'm looking for
is an introduction.
Fine.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.593
You gotta put a good word
in for me with Emma.

16:10.803 --> 16:15.057
- There you go, Cinderella.
- Thank you.

16:15.141 --> 16:19.645
I have trouble
with things like that.
The, um- The messy things.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.688
Yeah.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.857
It's really nice
how much you care about Glee.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.068
About the kids.
[Bell Rings]

16:26.152 --> 16:29.279
If you really care about
these kids, you'll leave
well enough alone.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.198
Children like to know
where they stand.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.159
So let your little Glee kids
have their little club.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.996
But don't pretend
that any of them
are something they're not.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.040
[Buzzing]

16:44.462 --> 16:46.755
[Whistle Blows]
Circle up!

16:46.839 --> 16:49.132

is gonna talk to you.

16:49.217 --> 16:53.595
You don't listen, you do laps.
You mouth off, you do laps.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.931
Got it?
They're all yours, Will.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.016
Thanks, Ken.
Hey, guys. How you doing?

16:58.101 --> 17:02.604
I think I recognize some of you
from Spanish class.
But, uh, I'm—

17:02.689 --> 17:05.691
I'm here today to talk to you
about something different.
Uh, music.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.651
[Chuckles Nervously]

17:09.779 --> 17:11.905
Glee Club needs guys.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.907
I can sing.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.034
Really? That's fantastic.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.453

- Yeah.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.393

at the door. So if anyone
wants to sign up, please—

Thank you.
