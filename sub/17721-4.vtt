00:01.750 --> 00:03.291
Erica: First day of a new job.

00:03.291 --> 00:06.083
Kind of like a first date
with your new career.

00:06.083 --> 00:08.208
Will it be love at first sight?

00:08.208 --> 00:10.416
Or will it be... "thanks for
dinner,

00:10.416 --> 00:12.083
maybe I'll call you sometime."

so, no shortcuts are allowed.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.375
Nothing less than perfection
will do.

00:32.041 --> 00:35.666
'Cause today could be the most
important day of your life.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.958
It could be the day
when it all falls into place.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.875
Or when it all falls to pieces.

(Suppresses squeal)

00:54.333 --> 00:56.375
- Hey. Hi.
- Erica.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.916
- Wow, look at you,
all dressed up for school.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.375
- So, um...

01:00.375 --> 01:01.833
Big day, huh? First day at work.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.500
- Mm-hm, I'm really excited,
You know?

01:03.500 --> 01:05.166
Despite the unintended skylight,

01:05.166 --> 01:06.500
I have a good feeling
about today.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.958
- Unintended skylight?

01:07.958 --> 01:09.416
- Don't ask. I have a good
feeling

01:09.416 --> 01:11.375
because I feel like I'm
turning a page in my life.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.166
Which is weird because when
your job is in publishing...

01:13.166 --> 01:15.375
and oh my God, I forgot to tell
you, that my new boss, Ambrose,

01:15.375 --> 01:16.833
he asked to read my short
stories.

01:16.833 --> 01:19.208
Which is like, ah!
Like it never happens, so...

01:19.208 --> 01:21.416
Oh my God, am I still talking?
- Not anymore.

01:21.416 --> 01:23.125
- I talk a lot when I'm nervous.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.208
- Yeah, I know this about you.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.666
- Of course.

01:27.666 --> 01:30.208
I'm not just nervous because
it's my first day of work,

01:30.208 --> 01:35.333
I'm nervous because of...
the thing...

01:37.000 --> 01:40.500
- The thing?
- The thing that we did with
our mouths.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.333
It was nice. I thought.

01:43.333 --> 01:46.041
- Me too. So, what do we do?

01:46.041 --> 01:48.416
- Um, I guess we talk?
Like, grownups?

01:48.416 --> 01:50.416
- Over dinner. I'll cook.

01:50.416 --> 01:52.208
- Uh, you don't cook, you heat.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.416
I know this about you.

01:54.416 --> 01:56.833
- Well... listen, uh,
knock 'em dead today.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.875
- Thank you. Good.

01:58.875 --> 02:02.291
Uh... okay.
- Oh, yup.

02:02.291 --> 02:07.250
Oh, taxi. Hi. Taxi. (Yelps)
Man: Taxi!

02:07.291 --> 02:09.166
- No-no-no-no, wait-wait, wait!

02:09.166 --> 02:11.208
- Thanks, buddy.
- Wait.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.166
Tax- taxi-taxi!

02:16.166 --> 02:18.083
(Shocked gasp) No!

- Oh, I know.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.583
It's my first day of work
and my new heels snapped.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.291
So, do I wait for a shoe store
to open and show up an hour late

02:39.291 --> 02:41.166
or do I hit the local pharmacy,

02:41.166 --> 02:42.583
and plug the old debit card
and--

02:42.583 --> 02:43.958
- And hope your boss thinks
it's enterprising

02:43.958 --> 02:45.500
and not desperate.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.125
I'm Julianne. This is Brent.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.666
- Hey, nice to meet you.

02:48.666 --> 02:51.041
Um, I should probably
go report to Ambrose.

02:51.041 --> 02:54.000
- About that. Ambrose has
"moved on"

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
to "other opportunities".

02:56.000 --> 02:58.875
- Oh? I'm surprised.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.208
- So was Ambrose.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.166
- He got replaced.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.875
By the woman who edited
"The secret of now".

03:04.875 --> 03:06.500
- "The secret of now?"

03:06.500 --> 03:08.416
Isn't that just a knock off
of "The secret"?

03:08.416 --> 03:10.250
(Wheezed chuckle)

03:10.250 --> 03:12.750
- A knock off of "The secret"?

03:12.750 --> 03:15.375
It's actually one of the best
selling self-help titles
of the year.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.166
- Of course.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.166
Um, I should probably
go find my new boss.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.250
- She's right here, Erica.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.958
- Oh, I'm... (stammers)

03:26.958 --> 03:29.625
I'm just really sorry,
I thought that you were--

03:29.625 --> 03:31.625
- You thought,
"here's this young babe,

03:31.625 --> 03:33.458
she just has to be
somebody's assistant.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.625
She couldn't possibly be
the new editorial director

03:35.625 --> 03:37.333

03:37.333 --> 03:38.416
But I am.

03:38.416 --> 03:41.250
And I didn't get here because
I look good in a skirt.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.166
I earned it.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.375
You want on my team?
You better do the same.

When they promoted Julianne
to editorial director,

04:43.458 --> 04:45.375
she made me junior editor.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.125
She fought for me. Hard.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.041
- Congratulations.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.708
- Thanks, but I know her agenda.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.833

your enemies close and...

even closer".

04:57.333 --> 04:59.416
Julianne: See you at department
meeting this afternoon, Frank.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.708
- I am sure that you'll have
a terrific slate

05:01.708 --> 05:03.625
of projects to show us.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.000
- We're gonna do great things,
Frank.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.000
I mean, I know of his
reputation.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.333
River Rock has published some
important pieces of literature.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.333
- Well, important pieces
of literature

05:18.333 --> 05:20.708
don't move units. Not anymore.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.666
- You know what does? This.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.250
We sold half a million copies
last year.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.833
You know why?
This book helps people.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.416
- Well, I'll be sure to read it.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.416
Hm, well, this copy's signed.
You have to buy your own.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.833
- Oh, right. (Laughs)

05:34.833 --> 05:36.125
- (Clears throat) So...

05:37.625 --> 05:39.208
- (Clears throat)

05:39.208 --> 05:41.583
- You have two degrees
in English lit?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.875
You've never been an editorial
assistant before.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.791
You never even worked
in publishing before.

05:45.791 --> 05:48.583
You're how old?
- I'm 32.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.958
- Huh, because I'm 27.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.541
I took my first proof reading
job right out of high school.

05:53.541 --> 05:55.583
- Look, I understand
you have qualms.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.291
- Heh, because people who have
two degrees in English lit

05:59.500 --> 06:02.708
and use words like, "qualms"
are usually literature-snobs.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.458
And I have no time for them.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.000
- I understand. And honestly,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.916
I'm not some ivory tower
English-lit snob. (laughs)

06:09.291 --> 06:11.250
- Hm... yeah, I beg to differ.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.416
See... (file drawer opens)

06:14.416 --> 06:18.583
I read your short collection
of even shorter stories.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.625
Hm. Ambrose left it for me.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.625
- How nice of him.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.333
- They're very heavy.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.916
- I wrote them in university

06:25.916 --> 06:27.583
and I haven't had time
for re-writes.

06:27.583 --> 06:30.708
You've had over ten years.
- (Awkward laugh)

06:30.708 --> 06:32.666
Well, if you're done with them,
I'd love to have them back?

06:32.666 --> 06:35.291
- Ah-ah-ah, who said I was done?

06:35.291 --> 06:37.333
Who knows, maybe I'll even
show these to Frank.

- (Uncomfortable laugh)

06:41.750 --> 06:43.333
- Brent!

06:44.958 --> 06:46.875
Can you show Erica
to the coffee lounge.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.750
It's time to send her to school.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.291
- (Giggles) Okay.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.750
Brent? You've worked with
Julianne for a long time.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.166
How'd you do it without, um...

06:56.166 --> 06:57.958
- Going insane?
- Yeah.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.416
- A lot of meditation.
Yoga, every morning.

07:00.416 --> 07:03.291
Plus, I'm heavily medicated.
- Oh.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.458
(Clicking teeth)

07:05.458 --> 07:07.750
Hmm, out of her favorite
organic espresso beans.

07:07.750 --> 07:08.416
- What?

07:08.416 --> 07:10.958
- You could make her latte with
regular beans, your choice.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.458
- No, you point me
to the nearest Starbucks.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.458
I need to go buy organic
espresso beans, stat.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.166
- Ah! Score one for the newbie.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.583
You passed the test. Good one.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.291
No need for Starbucks,

07:19.291 --> 07:20.750
I keep a spare bag
of espresso beans

07:20.750 --> 07:22.708
in my "emergency drawer".
- Oh, thank God.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.416
Julianne goes Hannibal if you
make her a latte with reg.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
She gets this sexy
little lip curl.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.458
God, she can be so hot.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.625

speak of the devil.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.416
Okay, if she needs me,
I'll be right back.

07:35.416 --> 07:37.625
Don't move.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.208
(Office phone rings)

07:41.125 --> 07:43.833
- Good morning.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.791
- (Whispers) What are you doing
here?

07:45.791 --> 07:47.666
This is a private office,
you can't just barge in here.

07:47.666 --> 07:49.666
- I did not barge, I waltzed.

07:49.666 --> 07:51.458
That security guard, Phil?
He is a sweet guy.

07:53.666 --> 07:55.291
- You need to go.

07:55.291 --> 07:56.833
I am feeling anxious enough
to begin with,

07:56.833 --> 07:58.625
this isn't helping.
- Oh. Feelings of anxiousness.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.708
- Could you not do that?

08:01.708 --> 08:03.583
- Taking notes is a part
of my job.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.541
Okay, speak to me.

08:05.541 --> 08:07.833
Mm. How else are you feeling?

08:07.833 --> 08:10.041
- Um... frustrated.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.458
I'm finally in a place
that I wanna be at

08:12.458 --> 08:14.875
and my boss is a "passive
aggressive bitch-face."

08:14.875 --> 08:16.708
- "Bitch-face".

08:16.708 --> 08:18.750
- Oh my God, I hate air quotes!
Who even does that?

08:18.750 --> 08:20.916
- You know that bumper sticker
"question authority"?

08:20.916 --> 08:22.875
I think a better one for you
right now might be,

08:22.875 --> 08:24.833
"question your attitude
towards authority."

08:26.458 --> 08:28.083
- And what is that supposed
to mean?

08:28.083 --> 08:30.458
- Oh, you're a smart woman,
you'll "figure it out".

08:30.458 --> 08:32.791
Oh, by the way,
I made myself a dopio espresso

08:32.791 --> 08:35.541
and I finished the beans.
I hope that's okay.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.208
- Will you please leave?

08:37.208 --> 08:39.708
Why don't you go say "hi"
to your good buddy, Phil, huh?

08:39.708 --> 08:41.166
Tell him I said "hi", too.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.541
- I'll go... for now.
- Okay, heh.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.000
- Who was that?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.500
- I think he's from accounting.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.000
- With those cheek bones?
Me no think so.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.791

bag crinkles)

08:52.000 --> 08:54.458

of the latte, sensei.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.666
- Well said.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.750
- Thank you so much
for coming in today.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.708
Ambrose spoke so highly of you.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.750
- Ambrose and I, we go way back.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.625
I was very sad to hear
about his departure,

09:05.625 --> 09:07.625
but I'm really hoping that
you and I can move forward

09:07.625 --> 09:09.583
with my book, Julianne.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.750
- Oh, so do I, Marcus.
- Mark, please.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.416
- Mm. (slurps)

09:14.416 --> 09:16.875
(Taken aback murmurs)
Ooh... okay.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.791
So, um, I've read your outline

09:21.791 --> 09:23.958
and I hate to be
such a Debbie downer,

09:23.958 --> 09:25.916
but it really dwells
in the past.

09:27.666 --> 09:31.000
- It's a memoir.
- Mm-hm.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.958
Have you heard of a little
bestseller called

09:32.958 --> 09:34.958
"The secret of now"?

09:34.958 --> 09:37.083
- Well, you have a framed cover
behind you.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.333
- Oh. (laughs) Right,
there it is. Um...

09:40.958 --> 09:43.750
The author, Thomas Friedken,
friend of mine.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.958
He says "strive not
to look behind,

09:46.958 --> 09:48.750
but always to the present
moment.

09:48.750 --> 09:52.166
Look to the now."

09:52.166 --> 09:54.750
I wonder if you can bring
any of that wisdom
to your memoir?

09:54.750 --> 09:56.583
- I'm not really sure
if I follow you.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.125
- Perhaps, if I may,

09:58.125 --> 09:59.916
what Julianne is saying is that
we're looking for projects

09:59.916 --> 10:03.458
with a self-help angle.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.541
- We need something
for the millenials,

10:05.541 --> 10:08.625
we need something we can market
on social networking sites,

10:08.625 --> 10:10.708
like facebook, or myspace.
Are you familiar with those?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.000
- I've dropped in a few times.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.833
- Well, it was awesome
to meet you, Marcus.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.916
- Mark, please.

10:18.916 --> 10:21.958
- So, we're gonna kick
your outline around,

10:21.958 --> 10:24.958
"jam on it", see what we can
come up with. Sound good?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.666
Well, thank you for meeting
with me.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.708
- Okay, Stahl's outline.
Read it, type up some notes.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.375
We better look like we tried
to come up with something.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.416
- Sure, sure.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.583
And I'm sending you back
to latte school.
This was repulsive.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.958
(Office phone rings)

10:41.958 --> 10:45.166
- Uh, this memoir's slow going.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.916
Except for this one chapter
that's riveting.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.333
- Well, you can't charge people
$29.95 hardcover

10:50.333 --> 10:51.875
for one chapter.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.791
- Unless you made more of it,
like...

10:54.791 --> 10:56.083
whatever, I'm supposed
to write notes,

10:56.083 --> 10:57.000
not reinvent the wheel.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
- Well, Erica, if there's one
thing you do know,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.750
it's books, okay?

11:00.750 --> 11:03.916
Don't hold back all your good
ideas. Unleash them!

11:03.916 --> 11:06.000
- Trust me, I've been doing
enough unleashing, lately.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.541
I kissed Ethan.

11:09.541 --> 11:12.000
I mean, I, I really kissed him.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.666
- That is not the kind
of bomb you drop

11:13.666 --> 11:15.041
on the middle of a conversation!

11:15.041 --> 11:16.416
- I know. I'm sorry.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.458
- So...

11:19.458 --> 11:21.958
after all these years,
you, you made out?

11:21.958 --> 11:23.416
- Mm-hm.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.041
- Well, was it good?
- Very. But I mean...

11:25.041 --> 11:26.750
Waitress: Menu.
- Thank you.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.166
That's not what it's about.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.125
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't.

11:30.125 --> 11:33.000
I mean, dating Ethan,
it would be weird.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.041
And complicated. I mean,
he just separated from his wife!

11:36.041 --> 11:37.791
- Just answer this one question.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.750
Is Ethan the kind of guy that
you could see yourself with?

11:42.916 --> 11:44.625
- Yes.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.166
No. Maybe.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.625
I don't know, I don't know.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.458
- That's something
you need to figure out.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.958
The kiss... scale of one to ten?

11:53.958 --> 11:56.708
- Ten... thousand.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.375
(Laughing)

12:00.958 --> 12:03.625
Julianne: The board wants me
to deliver a bigger,

12:03.625 --> 12:06.958
better "secret of now".

12:06.958 --> 12:09.083
This is not it.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.333
I think we have to kill it.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.208
We already gave Stahl
a healthy advance.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.166
- Ah, Ambrose did, not me.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.041
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.041
I mean, if someone
has a great idea

12:21.041 --> 12:23.458
on how to salvage this project,
I'm all ears.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.083
(Saucer clanks onto table)

12:28.083 --> 12:30.000
- Okay.
- Communications.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.083
- "E.T. phone home"?
I don't see how that applies.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.083
- Just... Stahl invented
the banting 7204 satellite

12:40.333 --> 12:42.500
which launched a revolution
in digital communications.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.625
- Yawn. Uh, where's the "juice"?

12:47.166 --> 12:48.458
- Uh, he was a crack addict.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.125
Wife, kids, a titan of business,

12:52.125 --> 12:53.875
but there he was,
night after night,

12:53.875 --> 12:55.250
smoking crack with gang members.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.791
- Dark. I don't like it.

12:56.791 --> 12:58.583
- Oh, but he beat the
addiction, won his family back,

12:58.583 --> 13:00.166
returned to the top
of the business world

13:00.166 --> 13:02.833
and I really feel like there's
a lot of "juice" in that.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.750
But I'm... I'm just
the assistant, so.

13:13.916 --> 13:16.625
- (scoffs) Well...

13:16.625 --> 13:18.666
I don't know why they're
paying me all the money,

13:18.666 --> 13:21.041
she's the one
with all the fab ideas!

13:21.041 --> 13:23.041
(Strained laughter,
board members laugh)

13:26.208 --> 13:28.125
Ah... that was... phew.

- And a little cruel.

(Composing breaths)

16:15.333 --> 16:17.250
Julianne, we need to talk.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.916
- Uh, I need to prepare
for a presentation.

16:18.916 --> 16:20.291
You need to be somewhere else.

16:20.291 --> 16:21.875
(Keyboard keys clack)

16:23.833 --> 16:25.291
And you're still here.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.750
- I just need 60 seconds
of your time.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.166
- You got 15.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.916
- What?
- 13.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.875
- Well, um, uh...
- Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.000
- Maybe we, uh...
- Use your words.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.416
- We could talk, um, we...
(stunted mumbling)

16:36.416 --> 16:38.333
- And your time's up.
Thanks for coming in.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.166
(Gasps, panicked gasps)

16:47.166 --> 16:48.916
- Thirsty?

16:50.583 --> 16:52.333
"You don't miss your water
till your well runs dry."

16:52.333 --> 16:54.166
William Bell.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.875
- Not thirsty. Not really.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.583
- When I get nervous,
my mouth it just...

16:57.583 --> 16:59.166
it just dries up
like the Gobi desert.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.375
- Mm, cotton-mouth. The pasties.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.041
(smacks lips)
Also known as dough-mouth.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.458
In medicine terms we refer
to it as xerostomia.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.958
The rapid depletion of moisture
from the mouth.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.208
It's triggered by anxiety.
- (Sarcastic half laugh)

17:11.208 --> 17:13.250
- Common side effect
of marijuana inhalation.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.791
- There's an idea.

17:14.791 --> 17:16.666
Maybe I should go high
for work, that might help?

17:16.666 --> 17:18.750
- I doubt it. I think Julianne
would harsh your mellow.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.333
Sit.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.375
- I should get back to work.
- I insist.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.041
- I don't think I need
to root around in my past

17:26.041 --> 17:27.791
to figure out why a psychotic
boss makes me tongue-tied.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.625
- (sighs) Would you say
that you are someone

17:31.625 --> 17:33.750
who is comfortable
with confrontation?

17:35.333 --> 17:37.500
- Who is?
- Ah, your new boss.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.375
A controlling, passive
aggressive, downright cruel.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.916
I mean, she is so good
at getting under your skin,

17:42.916 --> 17:45.625
you actually lose
the power of speech.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.083
Does that sound like
anyone you know?

17:51.125 --> 17:53.083
- My mother?

17:56.916 --> 17:58.416
Lozar.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.208
- Tell me about him.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.333
- Antonin Lozar.
- Whoaaa!

18:06.958 --> 18:09.416
Erica: Intense lecturer,
esteemed professor,

18:09.416 --> 18:11.125
and the dread of every first
year creative writing student.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.291
Lozar: Erica, are you paying
attention?

18:14.291 --> 18:16.333
Erica: And for Ethan,
it was a bird course,

18:16.333 --> 18:18.291
but for me?
It was life or death.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.166
I mean, I loved poetry.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.541
I was determined
to impress him.

18:22.541 --> 18:26.333
And I thought I wrote the poem
that was gonna win his respect:

18:26.333 --> 18:28.000
"Snowflakes".

18:28.000 --> 18:30.333
It was about the uniqueness
of every soul.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.000
(reading) "Have I been made
into this snowflake?"

18:33.000 --> 18:34.416
Erica: Lozar never cared
for anything that I wrote,

18:34.416 --> 18:36.416
but for "Snowflakes",

18:36.416 --> 18:39.041
he dug down to a special place
in his heart

18:39.041 --> 18:41.333
where true evil lurked.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.166
(Fingernails scratch loudly)

18:45.333 --> 18:48.000
- "They-they slipped through..."
- What?!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.041
Erica: Soon I felt suffocated.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.166
Lozar: Come on, come on.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.791
Erica: I mean, I did what
anyone would do, right?

18:53.791 --> 18:55.375
- You ran.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.958
Lozar: Coward!
You will never be a writer.

18:56.958 --> 18:59.166
- And never came back.
I failed the course.

19:02.416 --> 19:05.000
Come to think of it...

19:05.000 --> 19:07.083
I haven't written
anything creative, since.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.750
If I could do it over?

19:08.750 --> 19:12.125
I would look Lozar in the eyes
and recite "Snowflakes."

19:12.125 --> 19:14.500
Every single word.

19:17.041 --> 19:18.458
- I'll see you on the other
side.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.041
- No, no, wait,
I need prep-time.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.750
I haven't read the poem
in, like, 15 years!

19:21.750 --> 19:24.541
- "We are postponing, life
speeds by." Seneca, 5 B.C..

19:24.541 --> 19:27.250
- No, seriously. Stop with the
cold, please.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.625
No-no-no, 'kay, just...
Hit pause! (glass shatters)

19:29.625 --> 19:32.333
Lozar: Ethan, you are going
to read to us.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.708
- Sorry, I think I, um,
had an allergic reaction.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.125
Might wanna think about
getting some pollen filters

19:37.125 --> 19:40.208
in the venting.
Lozar: Erica.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.541
- Yes, professor?
- Shut up.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.166
- Okay.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.583
- Okay, Ethan, before we were
so rudely disturbed,

19:46.583 --> 19:49.583
you were going to read us
from your new work.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.375
Ethan: Okay, sure, uh...

19:51.375 --> 19:53.416
Lozar: Come on, begin, please.

19:53.416 --> 19:56.166
- This is a poem I wrote called
"Your love is a drive-by".

19:57.708 --> 19:59.416
"Your love is a drive-by.

19:59.416 --> 20:02.208
Your bullets go ping off
the body armor of my heart.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.208
Ping! Ping! Ping!

20:04.208 --> 20:06.000
Ping!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.416
Ping-ping! Ping! Ping!

20:08.416 --> 20:10.000
Ping-ping-ping!

20:10.000 --> 20:13.208
- All right, Ethan.
- ...ping! Ping-ping-ping!

20:13.208 --> 20:15.083
- I said, that's enough!

20:17.166 --> 20:19.583
(exasperated exhale)
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.

20:19.583 --> 20:23.041
Again you take us down with you

20:23.041 --> 20:25.875
to the very sub-basement
of self-expression.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.250
And for that, I thank you.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.125
- Um... You're-you're welcome?

20:33.125 --> 20:36.291
- And you're... shit.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.666
Your poetry is shit.

20:38.666 --> 20:40.583
Even your pen... shit!

20:42.666 --> 20:44.375
Just sit down.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.458
Erica Strange. You're next.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.666
- Uh... um, professor,
I just have a little problem.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.583
- So, do I.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.500
I have to endure another one
of your "poems".

20:56.000 --> 20:57.916
- You air quote too?

20:59.458 --> 21:02.250
- We are waiting, Erica, hm?

21:07.583 --> 21:10.666
- (Clears throat) I call this
piece "Snowflakes".

21:10.666 --> 21:12.583
- Poetry is organic.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.541
It lives when you speak it,
not when you read it!

21:18.083 --> 21:21.458
Here are your snowflakes, Erica.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.541
Itty, bitty, tiny snowflakes.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.625
Still, we wait.
- Um, uh...

21:33.291 --> 21:35.416
(Panicked breath, stammers)

21:37.000 --> 21:39.791
"I am crouched

21:39.791 --> 21:41.625
on the axis of the sun
on the edge of my cloud--"

21:44.500 --> 21:49.500
- Oh, give me something
with passion.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.291
- "Wombs, pregnant with
thought--"

21:52.291 --> 21:54.250
- Oh, God, I wish to die!

21:56.500 --> 21:59.291
- Has this, um...
(Nervous stammer)

21:59.291 --> 22:01.166
Oh God...

22:01.166 --> 22:04.125
- "Have-have I been made
into this snowflake or--"

22:04.125 --> 22:09.125
- Slush! Sentimental,
juvenile slush!

22:13.333 --> 22:15.000
You hate me right now, huh?

22:16.291 --> 22:17.916
You feel like you're being
attacked?

22:17.916 --> 22:19.666
Show me what you feel.

22:19.666 --> 22:21.708
Come on, express your pain.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.583
Express from within!

22:26.000 --> 22:27.666
- (Stressed breaths)

22:27.666 --> 22:30.041
- (Whispers)
"My loneliness is killing me."

22:30.041 --> 22:31.958
- Louder!

22:31.958 --> 22:34.083
- (Whispers louder)
"I must confess I still
believe..."

22:35.625 --> 22:37.708
- Believe in what? Tell me!

22:37.708 --> 22:40.833
- "When I'm not with you
I lose my mind

22:40.833 --> 22:43.375
Give me a sign...

22:43.375 --> 22:45.416
Hit me baby one more time!"

22:45.416 --> 22:49.750
- Yes! Speak the voice
of the victim!

22:49.750 --> 22:52.416
("Baby hit me on more time"
By Britney Spears plays)

22:52.416 --> 22:55.583
"The reason I breathe is you

22:55.583 --> 22:57.750
You've got me blinded

22:57.750 --> 22:59.708
There's nothing I wouldn't do

23:01.333 --> 23:03.708
It's not the way I planned it

23:03.708 --> 23:06.083
I must confess

23:06.083 --> 23:08.250
My loneliness is killing me

23:10.291 --> 23:11.791
Don't you know

23:11.791 --> 23:14.458
I still believe

23:14.458 --> 23:17.083
When I'm not with you
I lose my mind

23:17.083 --> 23:19.416
Give me a sign

23:19.416 --> 23:21.708
Hit me baby one more time!"

23:21.708 --> 23:24.250
- Yes! Yeah!

23:45.291 --> 23:47.250
And all just from the top
of your head?

23:47.250 --> 23:49.833
- Yeah. It's straight from
there.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.583
- Who'd even think of writing
an ode to one's oppressor?

23:52.583 --> 23:54.666
Genius! I love...

23:54.666 --> 23:56.500
Come here, my little poetess!

23:56.500 --> 23:59.125
Hey, I think you should call
your piece: "voice of flame".

24:01.208 --> 24:03.500
- I was thinking of calling it,
uh...

24:03.500 --> 24:05.958
"Hit me baby one more time".

24:05.958 --> 24:08.375
- No. "voice of flame".
Much better.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.958
- Okay.
- Hey, everybody!

24:10.958 --> 24:13.291
You must come
to the poetry slam.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.125
Erica will be reciting
her new work!

24:16.708 --> 24:19.166
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no.
He's joking.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.250
Professor, that's a one-time
only performance. Really.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.250
- Nonsense! You must share this
with an audience!

24:23.250 --> 24:25.458
Eh, I will insist on it!

24:27.875 --> 24:30.458
(Country music plays)

24:30.458 --> 24:32.708
- Look, I'm just gonna
come right out and ask.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.875
You just recited this weird
poem about this abusive guy,

24:34.875 --> 24:36.291
do I have to kick
somebody's ass?

24:36.291 --> 24:38.416
- No, no-no-no-no-no.
I made that up.

24:38.416 --> 24:40.166
I am fine. (laughs)
I just made it up.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.750
- Ethan!

24:43.750 --> 24:45.916
- Claire! Hey.

24:45.916 --> 24:47.583
(Kissing)

24:51.583 --> 24:53.958
Thanks for coming.
- Mmm.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.708
So drinking in the afternoon?

24:56.708 --> 24:58.750
That's so un-Toronto of you.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.208
- It's a celebration.
Erica has been reborn

25:01.208 --> 25:03.416
as a poetess of fire!

25:03.416 --> 25:05.875
- I'm so sad that he snapped
your lucky pen.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.333
Yeah, I guess he didn't like
my sound effects.

25:07.333 --> 25:08.916
- Well, I did. I thought they
were evocative.

25:08.916 --> 25:10.541
- So did I.

25:10.541 --> 25:13.583
- Yeah. Pa-ping-ping.
- Shit. I'm out of cigarettes.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.666
Ethan, maybe, do you think...?

25:15.666 --> 25:17.166
- Yep. I'm on it.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.708
- (Exhales) So...
- So...

25:22.708 --> 25:24.208
- Erica.
- Yeah.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.666
- You're looking good.
- Thank you.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.416
So, I hope you don't mind
me asking like this,

25:27.416 --> 25:29.333
but, I mean, do you have
anyone special in your life?

25:29.333 --> 25:32.458
- You mean a boyfriend?
- Hm-hm.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.875
- It's April '95, right?
- Yeah.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.500
- I mean- yeah- no.
No one. Just single.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.416
- Oh. C'est plat, unh?

25:43.958 --> 25:45.583
Cute girl like you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.791 --> 25:51.208
- Actually, Claire...
there is this one guy.

25:53.416 --> 25:55.416
Old, old friend but recently--

25:55.416 --> 25:58.458
- You felt a spark?
But you're still unsure.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.875
- It's complicated.
- Oh.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.875
See, when I saw Ethan
I just knew.

26:04.875 --> 26:07.541
I mean no hesitation.
No second-guessing...

26:09.791 --> 26:11.791
and you see, now he's mine.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.833
- Mmm.
- And, uh...

26:16.833 --> 26:18.625
As for your situation. Well...

26:20.250 --> 26:21.458
Some things are just
not meant to be.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.875
- I guess you're right.
- You'll find your Ethan
one day.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.458
- One day.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.791
Dr. Tom: Walkies!
(Whistles to dog)

26:29.791 --> 26:31.916
- Um... I gotta jet, but...

26:33.666 --> 26:35.833
thank you for the chat, Claire.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.416
Dr. Tom?!

26:39.416 --> 26:41.666
Hey! Dr. Tom, wait-wait-wait!

26:43.125 --> 26:45.166
(Pants)

26:45.166 --> 26:47.541
So you're a dog-walker
this time?

26:47.541 --> 26:49.625
(Chuckles) Love the fanny-pack.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.833
- Yes. It's convenient
for carrying treats.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.958
Isn't that right, beautiful?

26:53.958 --> 26:55.208
- Hey? What're your thoughts?

26:56.791 --> 26:58.250
- You know what I love about
dogs?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.458
They never pretend
to be anything they're not.

27:00.458 --> 27:01.875
You know? I mean, look at them.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.333
You get what you pay for
with a dog.

27:03.333 --> 27:04.916
No artifice.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.125
- Oh, so you're upset
that I improvised.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.666
- Do you think that it's
appropriate

27:08.666 --> 27:10.958
to address one of your
life regrets through plagiary?

27:10.958 --> 27:12.750
- Look, I'm not proud of this?

27:12.750 --> 27:14.500
But I know my Britney Spears.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.000
And "Hit me baby one more time"
isn't coming out for years.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.791
- Are you kidding me?

27:18.791 --> 27:20.958
You came back here to do
something specific, right?

27:20.958 --> 27:22.500
- I know, I know.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.333
I wanted to face-off Lozar
and read "Snowflakes".

27:25.333 --> 27:27.041
But he tore up the page
that it was written on

27:27.041 --> 27:28.791
and I can't remember it!

27:28.791 --> 27:30.500
- "Defeatism is the
wretchedness of policies."

27:30.500 --> 27:32.083
George Bernard Shaw.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.833
- No. I'm not being defeatist;
I don't have a copy!

27:36.541 --> 27:38.291
Why does it matter so much
that I even read "Snowflakes"?

27:38.291 --> 27:39.666
Hm?

27:43.083 --> 27:45.166
Are you ever gonna answer a
direct question when I ask it?

27:45.166 --> 27:47.458
- Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

- Hey!
- Hey!

28:36.041 --> 28:37.583
- Where's Claire?

28:37.583 --> 28:38.958
- (Grunts) She went with some
friends

28:38.958 --> 28:40.583
to see Chumbawumba
at the Phoenix.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.083
(Grunts) 12... Aagh!

28:45.166 --> 28:46.916
- Wow, you're hot.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.666
The from the exertion
of the... y-you're sweaty.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.375
- No kidding. I better hit
the shower.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.583
- Whoa, Ethan! What're you
doing?

28:57.583 --> 28:59.333
- What I always do.

28:59.333 --> 29:00.750
- Yeah, but would you
put some clothes on.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.125
- Okay, mom.

29:03.125 --> 29:05.791
Eh, beer me.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.750
(Exhales heavily)

29:07.750 --> 29:10.916
(Bottles clank)

29:10.916 --> 29:13.083
(Tight inhale, heavy exhale)

29:14.666 --> 29:17.708
- Alley-hoop.

29:17.708 --> 29:20.083
(Beer cans fizzle
when they open)

29:21.583 --> 29:23.583
(Exhale forcefully)

29:23.583 --> 29:25.041
(Exhale forcefully)

29:25.041 --> 29:28.208
- (sighs) Can I ask you
a question?

29:28.208 --> 29:31.125
- Of course.
You can ask me anything.

29:31.125 --> 29:33.708
- Well, what's up with you
today? I mean, you seem
different.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.166
Like you're carrying around
this big secret.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.041
- I am. See, I'm from
the future.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.250
- Erica, what are you talking
about? What's going on with you?

29:40.250 --> 29:42.708
- You wanna know what's going
on with me? I will tell you.

29:42.708 --> 29:44.625
I'm stuck In a manner
of speaking,

29:44.625 --> 29:46.166
and I have to remember
something that I wrote.

29:46.166 --> 29:48.291
And I have no idea
why I have to remember it,

29:48.291 --> 29:50.000
but apparently, it's important!

29:50.000 --> 29:52.208
- Okay, what're you trying
to remember?

29:52.208 --> 29:55.333
- "Snowflakes". That poem I was
supposed to read for Lozar.

29:55.333 --> 29:58.208
I totally forgot
the last few lines.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.541
(Sighs deeply)

30:01.583 --> 30:04.750
- "I hate these generous
handfuls of snowflakes

30:04.750 --> 30:07.083
Like pennies,

30:07.083 --> 30:09.125
they slip through
my clenched hands,

30:09.125 --> 30:12.166
and are never enough."

30:12.166 --> 30:14.083
- (kiss) How on earth
did you remember that?

30:15.541 --> 30:17.166
Oh my God!

30:17.166 --> 30:19.291
- You read me the finished poem.
It was like two nights ago.

30:19.291 --> 30:21.708
- I've read you tons of poems.
Why'd you remember this one?

30:21.708 --> 30:24.583
- Because this one...

30:24.583 --> 30:26.083
This one was special.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.791
- It's goofy.
- No, it's not.

30:28.791 --> 30:30.958
Look, I'm no expert,
the kind of poetry I like

30:30.958 --> 30:32.791
is usually about gangsters.
But this one you wrote?

30:32.791 --> 30:35.208
It was just you.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.958
- Well, no wonder Lozar hated it
so much.

30:37.958 --> 30:40.291
- Screw him. This is who
you are. You don't need
his approval.

30:40.291 --> 30:42.041
- If only life were that simple.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.000
- It is.

30:45.541 --> 30:47.000
- It is, isn't it?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.208
Claire has no idea
how lucky she is.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.541
- (small laugh) I, um...

31:06.166 --> 31:07.875
I-I should probably shower.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.208
♪ Every little thing I do ♪

31:11.750 --> 31:13.791
♪ Trickles down
and lands on you ♪

31:17.208 --> 31:19.125
Erica: Thank you.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.333
- Claire's gonna be sad
she missed this.

31:21.333 --> 31:24.000
I told her there'd be lots
of chances to see Chumbawumba.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.875
- Yeah. It's not like
they're a one-hit wonder

31:25.875 --> 31:27.333
or anything.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.250
Mc: What's up, everybody?

31:29.250 --> 31:31.791
We all ready to hear some
poetry?

31:31.791 --> 31:34.208
(Light applause)
All right, right on.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.208
First up, someone new for y'all.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.125
She's a student here,

31:38.125 --> 31:40.250
studying with our esteemable
Professor Lozar,

31:40.250 --> 31:41.833
who asked me,

31:41.833 --> 31:44.166
make that insisted,
that I put her on tonight.

31:44.166 --> 31:46.875
She will be performing a piece
called "voice of flame".

31:48.375 --> 31:50.958
(Audience applauds)

31:50.958 --> 31:52.708
Lozar: To think, all semester
long

31:52.708 --> 31:54.125
you were this boring
little schoolgirl

31:54.125 --> 31:56.291
writing this pretentious vomit.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.916
(chuckles) Now, you go up there

31:58.916 --> 32:02.541
and you show them
the real Erica Strange!

32:02.541 --> 32:04.583
- Thank you. That's exactly
what I plan on doing.

32:06.250 --> 32:09.708
Mc: Okay, put your hands
together for Erica Strange!

32:09.708 --> 32:12.083
(Audience applauds and whoops)

32:15.250 --> 32:16.833
- Hi, everyone.

32:18.291 --> 32:19.750
(Nervous exhale)

32:19.750 --> 32:21.708
Uh, slight change in plans.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.500
This is called "Snowflakes".

32:26.500 --> 32:28.291
"I am crouched on the axis
of the sun

32:31.833 --> 32:35.041
Seated at the edge of my cloud.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.958
Womb, pregnant with thought

32:37.958 --> 32:40.041
have I been made
into this snowflake

32:40.041 --> 32:43.458
or has it been made into me?

32:43.458 --> 32:45.625
I hate these generous handfuls
of snowflakes

32:47.083 --> 32:48.625
like pennies,

32:48.625 --> 32:50.708
they slip through
my clenched hands

32:50.708 --> 32:52.750
and are never enough."

32:54.791 --> 32:56.833
Thank you.
(Audience applauds)

32:56.833 --> 32:59.208
Mc: All right.
(Audience applauds)

32:59.208 --> 33:01.333
Erica: Thank you.
Thank you.

33:04.208 --> 33:06.583
- I invited friends
to hear "voice of flame".

33:08.125 --> 33:10.083
Not this verbal diarrhea.

33:10.083 --> 33:12.208
Why would you chose
to do this unoriginal,

33:12.208 --> 33:14.083
melancholy, bullshit!

33:14.083 --> 33:16.083
- Because...

33:16.083 --> 33:17.500
- Yes, what, what?
Spit it out!

33:17.500 --> 33:20.208
- Because that's all I've got!

33:20.208 --> 33:22.333
Okay! "Snowflakes" are my words.
It is my poem.

33:24.333 --> 33:26.166
And I can say whatever I want,

33:26.166 --> 33:28.666
I don't have to impress you!
Or anyone here!

33:30.916 --> 33:33.500
- Calm down, Erica.
My friends here,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.583
they want to hear
"voice of flame".

33:35.583 --> 33:37.375
- Well, they will hear it
soon enough.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.250
in about four years.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.291
- Let's go.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.541
♪ But I will always
come around ♪

33:45.541 --> 33:47.541
♪ I fell through the ropes ♪

33:47.541 --> 33:49.500
♪ And right back
when all my hopes were intact ♪

33:49.500 --> 33:51.416
♪ I thought that's it, ♪

33:51.416 --> 33:53.750
♪ I should choose,
but I won't quit, I refuse ♪

33:56.583 --> 33:59.750
♪ No, I won't quit,
I'll refuse ♪

33:59.750 --> 34:01.208
- Erica? Erica! Erica!

34:01.208 --> 34:03.083
- Oh! I'm so sorry!

34:05.833 --> 34:08.291
Sorry...

34:08.291 --> 34:10.416
- Erica. Just...

34:10.416 --> 34:12.875
- (sing-song) Embarrassing.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.000
- Ah, well, I'm not in the
business

34:15.000 --> 34:17.416
of delivering uplifting
messages.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.541
I leave that to my dear friend,
Thomas Friedken.

34:20.541 --> 34:23.208
But, I do see great things
ahead for us

34:23.208 --> 34:25.083
here at River Rock publishing.

34:25.083 --> 34:28.500
And one of the projects
I am the most stoked about

34:28.500 --> 34:30.291
is a memoir from mogul
Marcus Stahl.

34:32.416 --> 34:34.666
Now I have to admit
when the proposal

34:34.666 --> 34:37.083
first came across my desk,
I had my doubts.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.500
It seemed, you know, blah.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.250
But then, it suddenly came
to me: communications.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.000
Stahl revolutionized
the industry.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.416
And I know what you're thinking,

34:48.416 --> 34:50.208
"Julianne, where's the 'juice'?"

34:50.208 --> 34:52.125
Wait for it.

34:52.125 --> 34:55.000
He was smoking crack
at the time!

34:55.000 --> 34:57.208
But he overcame the addiction
and...

34:57.208 --> 35:00.333
Oh, it's really just
an amazing, amazing story.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.750
And so what we have here
is a uniquely uplifting,

35:04.250 --> 35:07.000
self-help slash tell-all.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.458
And I think there's a lot
o' "juice" in that!

35:13.291 --> 35:16.125
- And I'll tell you
what I think. (clears throat)

35:18.375 --> 35:20.583
I think you've done it again.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.166
(Board members applaud)

35:22.166 --> 35:23.791
- (relieved sigh) All right.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.166
(Applause)

35:27.166 --> 35:29.041
- (Elated laughter)
You scared me for a minute.

35:29.041 --> 35:29.833
- Congratulations.

35:29.833 --> 35:33.166
- Oh good, oh yeah,
this was a tough one.
This was a tough one.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.375
- Julianne? Vancouver office
called.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.125
- I'll be right back, Frank.
- I'll be waiting.

35:41.708 --> 35:43.250
- Get Vancouver on the phone
for me.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.666
- Uh, yeah, I lied about that.
We need to talk.

35:45.666 --> 35:48.000
This is becoming a habit of
yours. A really annoying one.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.458
- I don't like the way
you treat me.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.291
- Oh, do tell.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.208
- It's one thing to talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

35:53.208 --> 35:55.583
It's another to mock a short
story that I wrote years ago.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.541
But stealing my ideas?
I won't accept it.

35:58.541 --> 36:00.500
- Ooh. Well then I will accept
your resignation.

36:02.916 --> 36:04.625
- Pardon?

36:04.625 --> 36:06.500
- Ugh, do I really need to
translate? You're fired.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.875
(Half laughs in disbelief)

36:16.166 --> 36:17.875
- (Sighs)

36:22.416 --> 36:24.083
- Julianne just told me
what happened.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.416
What got into you?
- Long story.

36:26.416 --> 36:28.333
- (Sighs) Well,

36:28.333 --> 36:30.000
the bad news is that
I'm gonna miss you.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
- Hmmm.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.583
- Good news is that now I'm free
to ask you out for a drink.

36:33.583 --> 36:36.083
- A drink?!
- Hm.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.625
- A "drink" drink? A date?
- Yeah.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.291
Oh, do you have a boyfriend?

36:39.291 --> 36:42.083
- Um... I hope so.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.666
I mean, we're friends
in transition to...

36:45.666 --> 36:48.208
A drink? You and me?

36:48.208 --> 36:49.541
It's funny 'cause I thought
that you were--

36:49.541 --> 36:51.208
- In a relationship?

36:51.208 --> 36:53.458
No, honey, I like to play
the field.

36:56.208 --> 36:58.083
Call me.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.500
Frank: I just want to say
congratulations again

36:59.500 --> 37:02.458
on this exciting new direction.
- Thank you so much, Frank.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.791
- So, would you say that
the theme is one of redemption?

37:04.791 --> 37:07.791
Or would you say it's more like
triumph over adversity? What?

37:07.791 --> 37:10.125
Well... yeah, I think either
one of those is fine.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.583
- Either one...
(Stunned stammer)

37:14.583 --> 37:16.541
What kind of framing device
were you thinking about?

37:16.541 --> 37:19.083
Life story's needs organizing,
first and foremost.

37:19.083 --> 37:22.541
- Erica.
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.750
Um, you were in on that
meeting, y-you took notes.

37:25.750 --> 37:28.166
Now's your chance to speak up.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.416
Please.

37:37.958 --> 37:39.958
Well, the floor is yours.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.208
- Julianne feels that
the memoir should start

37:44.208 --> 37:46.416
on one particular night in '91.

37:46.416 --> 37:47.791
Now, Stahl owed money
all over town

37:47.791 --> 37:49.500
and he was bottoming out
on cocaine.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.916
- Now that's one way
to grab the reader.

37:52.916 --> 37:55.000
Go on.

38:00.666 --> 38:03.166
- You wanted to see me?

38:03.166 --> 38:05.291
- Close the door.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.166
(Clears throat)

38:12.166 --> 38:15.166
- Well, you did it.
you earned your place.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.333
- What makes you so sure
I still want it?

38:17.333 --> 38:18.875
I bailed you out because
I care about the book,

38:18.875 --> 38:21.250
not 'cause I care about you.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.041
- Whatever.
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:24.666 --> 38:26.083
- Well, I never said
I was coming back.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.833
You stole my ideas, Julianne.

38:28.833 --> 38:32.583
- You really don't know
how this works, do you?

38:32.583 --> 38:34.375
Okay. Let me "break it down"
for you.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.833
Your ideas are a ball.

38:37.833 --> 38:40.291
You pass me the ball,
I drive it to the net,

38:40.291 --> 38:43.083
we score, we win,
we share in the glory.

38:45.375 --> 38:46.750
- That's a neat rationalization.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.541
- It's a game, Erica.

38:48.541 --> 38:50.791
Business is a game.
Publishing is a game.

38:50.791 --> 38:52.208
You can either stand
on the sidelines

38:52.208 --> 38:55.250
or you can play,
it's really your call.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.833
- Fine. One condition.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.875
- I'm not gonna be nice to you.

38:58.875 --> 39:01.625
- Just gimme back
my short stories.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.541
See you tomorrow.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.500
(Pleased breath)

39:32.750 --> 39:35.083
(Clears throat)

39:35.083 --> 39:37.375
(Elevator dings)

39:41.750 --> 39:43.250
- Sit.

39:45.291 --> 39:48.583
So, big plans tonight?

39:48.583 --> 39:51.333
- Not really. I'm just going
to hang... with Ethan.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.583
- You have that look
of nervous excitement.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.291
As if perhaps tonight is more
than just a "hang?"

39:58.291 --> 39:59.791
- (sarcastic laugh) Ha-ha.

39:59.791 --> 40:02.458
Well, I've been thinking.
And I think...

40:02.458 --> 40:05.291
I think I should take a leap.

40:05.291 --> 40:07.000
Who knows? It could be great.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.750
It could be a disaster,
but it... it could be amazing.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.791
What?

40:17.791 --> 40:20.625
- Nothing.

40:20.625 --> 40:23.833
It's quite a thing to behold,
this new, confident Erica.

40:23.833 --> 40:27.500
Reciting the poem in her heart,
standing up her boss,

40:27.500 --> 40:29.833
taking a leap into love.

40:29.833 --> 40:31.416
I am pretty amazing, aren't I?

40:31.416 --> 40:34.791
- Alice M. Swain said
"courage is not the towering oak

40:34.791 --> 40:36.875
that sees storms come and go;

40:36.875 --> 40:39.708
it is the fragile blossom
that opens in the snow."

40:55.541 --> 40:58.583
- Thanks, Dr. Tom.
- Good night.

41:03.791 --> 41:05.166
Erica: Seems most of the time
we walk around

41:05.166 --> 41:06.958
with the world on mute.

41:06.958 --> 41:09.250
But when you're on the cusp
of something dramatic

41:09.250 --> 41:11.000
and maybe life-changing?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.625
It's like a filter comes off.

41:12.625 --> 41:15.291
And suddenly everything comes
alive.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.000
And even the smallest moment

41:17.000 --> 41:19.833
is imbued with the magic
of possibility.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.083
And you think:

41:23.083 --> 41:25.000
This is the night
when you drop your mask

41:25.000 --> 41:27.416
and reveal your true self.

41:27.416 --> 41:29.791
This is the night when
everything is rewritten.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.541
(Knocks) Ethan?

41:36.541 --> 41:38.625
You left the door open.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.708
(Door slams)

41:40.708 --> 41:43.250
Ethan: Hey. I'll, uh...
I'll be right out.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.916
- 'Kay.

41:45.916 --> 41:48.666
- Oh. Hey.

41:48.666 --> 41:51.041
- Hey.

41:51.041 --> 41:54.791
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too. Uh...

41:54.791 --> 41:57.208
Um, I bought us a nice bottle
of wine.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.083
- Oh.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.625
Oh wow. Uh, spared no expense,
huh?

42:02.625 --> 42:04.125
We're celebrating?

42:04.125 --> 42:05.791
- Yeah, I guess.
I'm feeling great.

42:05.791 --> 42:08.291
And I'm... I'm ready for our,
our talk.

42:11.375 --> 42:13.375
Are you okay?

42:15.958 --> 42:17.708
What's wrong?

42:17.708 --> 42:19.583
(Speechless breaths)

42:21.333 --> 42:23.333
What is this?

42:26.833 --> 42:28.916
Oh my God, you got served?

42:31.625 --> 42:33.833
- I-I knew it was coming.

42:33.833 --> 42:35.916
I wanna get divorced. I do.

42:37.583 --> 42:39.666
Claire and I are over,
I know that.

42:41.333 --> 42:43.958
But when I look at the papers
it's just, uh...

42:43.958 --> 42:45.875
It just seems so final.

42:47.416 --> 42:49.625
- I don't know what to say.

42:49.625 --> 42:52.833
- You don't have to say
anything. It's cool.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.666
Just another thing to celebrate,
right?

42:55.666 --> 42:58.250
- Ethan...

42:58.250 --> 42:59.916
- I'm fine. Really.

42:59.916 --> 43:02.500
Never been better actually.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.666
(Papers rustle)

43:05.666 --> 43:08.416
Wish I could find a corkscrew
in this goddamn dump
of an apartment.

43:08.416 --> 43:10.875
- Hey. It's okay. I'm here.

43:15.291 --> 43:17.083
- I'm glad.

43:17.083 --> 43:20.000
I really need a friend
right now.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.958
- I know. And you've got one.
I'm not going anywhere.

43:25.958 --> 43:27.000
It's okay.

43:28.916 --> 43:30.500
It's okay.
