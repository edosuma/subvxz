WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.369
SHE THOUGHT THAT THIS HOUSE
WAS KILLING HER.

00:04.371 --> 00:07.105
I KEEP HEARING VOICES.

00:07.107 --> 00:10.008
THERE WAS THIS SHADOW
STANDING THERE LIKE THIS,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.577
AND IT WAS MOVING FORWARD.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.012
THAT WAS THE LAST THING
THAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.981
- THERE WAS MORE.
- CAN YOU REACH OUT?

00:15.983 --> 00:18.850
TOUCH MY HAND.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.885
THIS ALL STARTED ONCE
YOU OPENED THAT ATTIC.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.254
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.490
WHAT IS GOING ON
IN THIS PLACE?

00:25.492 --> 00:27.893
GOD.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.898
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.200
I WAS ONLY 8 WHEN
A PARANORMAL INCIDENT

00:35.202 --> 00:38.270
CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.973
SINCE THEN, I'VE DEDICATED
MY TIME TO SOLVING

00:40.975 --> 00:44.142
THE MOST TERRIFYING
HAUNTINGS IMAGINABLE.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.710
I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.280
MORE THAN A DECADE AGO,
AN ENCOUNTER AT GETTYSBURG

00:48.282 --> 00:50.648
ROCKED MY BELIEFS
ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.650
TOGETHER,
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH

00:52.652 --> 00:54.586
BEHIND THE UNEXPLAINABLE.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.388
MY GOD!

00:56.390 --> 01:00.826
NOW WE'RE ON OUR MOST
IMPORTANT MISSION YET...

01:00.828 --> 01:03.362
HELPING FAMILIES OVERCOME
THEIR FEAR,

01:03.364 --> 01:07.799
TAKE BACK THEIR HOMES,
AND RECLAIM THEIR LIVES.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:16.243 --> 01:18.477
ADAM AND I ARE TRAVELING
HUNDREDS OF MILES

01:18.479 --> 01:22.347
TO HELP A YOUNG FAMILY
WITH FOUR KIDS IN FLORIDA.

01:22.349 --> 01:26.985
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING
A VERY ACTIVE HAUNTING.

01:26.987 --> 01:31.056
IT ALL STARTED WHEN
THEY OPENED THE ATTIC.

01:31.058 --> 01:35.727
VOICES AND SHADOW FIGURES BEGAN
TORTURING THE KIDS AT NIGHT.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.397
THEY ALREADY TRIED
SELLING THE HOUSE ONCE.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.700
NOW THEY FEEL STUCK AND HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT ELSE TO DO.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.868
- HI, GUYS.
- HI, GUYS!

01:42.870 --> 01:44.035
- HI.
- MIKE.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.237
- HEY, MIKE.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.139
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- WHY DID YOU CALL US HERE?

01:48.141 --> 01:51.476
BECAUSE I'VE LIVED HERE
5 YEARS AND, HONESTLY,

01:51.478 --> 01:52.911
I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE ANYMORE.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.512
- NO?
- NOT AT ALL.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.980
SO IT'S ESCALATED
OVER THAT TIME?

01:55.982 --> 01:57.515
YEAH. AND MY KIDS NOW.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.952
WHEN IT GOES TO YOUR KIDS,
IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE,

02:00.954 --> 02:03.989
YOU WANT TO PROTECT THEM
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.423
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,

02:05.425 --> 02:07.692
- I BEGGED MIKE TO MOVE.
- YEAH.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.893
I SAID, "THAT'S IT.
I'VE HEARD VOICES.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.029
I'VE GOTTEN MY HAIR PULLED.
I WANT OUT."

02:11.031 --> 02:13.231
WE PUT IT UP FOR SALE
FOR A GOOD, WHAT, 5, 6 MONTHS.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.399
YEAH.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.300
WE HAD A COUPLE BITES,
BUT NOTHING...

02:16.302 --> 02:17.636
NOTHING WOULD...

02:17.638 --> 02:19.938
AND I'M LIKE, "ARE WE
STUCK HERE FOR A REASON?"

02:19.940 --> 02:22.106
THIS IS WHERE WE STARTED
OUR FAMILY,

02:22.108 --> 02:23.908
SO I FEEL LIKE
IT HAS MEANING,

02:23.910 --> 02:28.213
AND I HATE TO LEAVE,
BUT KIDS COME FIRST.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.081
YOU WANT TO STAY HERE,
BUT IF THE KIDS ARE GOING

02:30.083 --> 02:31.649
TO BE AFFECTED,
YOU WOULD SELL IN A HEARTBEAT.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.952
- YEAH. 100%.
- DEFINITELY, YEAH.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.887
BUT WE HATE SEEING PEOPLE
CHASED OUT OF THEIR HOUSES,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.855
SO WHY DON'T WE GO THROUGH
ROOM BY ROOM,

02:37.857 --> 02:39.057
AND YOU JUST TELL US

02:39.059 --> 02:41.526
SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES
YOU GUYS HAVE HAD?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.729
SO WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

02:43.731 --> 02:47.432
I WAS WASHING BOTTLES
ONE DAY RIGHT HERE,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.935
AND I WAS LOOKING
IN THE REFLECTION,

02:49.937 --> 02:54.072
AND I WATCHED MY HAIR
GET TUGGED SIDEWAYS.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.475
AND AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED,

02:56.477 --> 03:00.145
PAPER TOWEL ROLLER
WOULD DO THIS.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.179
- ALL BY ITSELF?
- YEP.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.414
IT CAME OUT
THAT MUCH?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.716
AND DID EXACTLY LIKE THAT.
NOW MY EYES...

03:04.718 --> 03:06.150
DEEP BREATHS.
JUST DEEP BREATHS.

03:06.152 --> 03:09.587
- I KNOW. IT'S A LOT. SORRY.
- NO, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CRY

03:09.589 --> 03:11.122
AT ANY POINT BECAUSE IT'S --
I MEAN...

03:11.124 --> 03:12.391
IT IS SCARY.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.292
BUT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR SOMEONE

03:14.294 --> 03:15.660
TO COME HELP YOU, AND I --

03:15.662 --> 03:18.529
JUST HAVING DEALT WITH
SO MANY FAMILIES,

03:18.531 --> 03:20.065
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.733
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.267
AND SO WHEN WE GET HERE
AND SUDDENLY YOU <i> CAN,</i>

03:23.269 --> 03:24.536
IT CAN GET
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.671
SAD. AND I DON'T WANT, LIKE,
MY TOWN TO THINK I'M CRAZY,

03:26.673 --> 03:28.172
BUT IT'S LIKE...
- NO. NO.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.429
- HOW OLD IS HAILEY?
- 10.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.733
I GUESS JUST THE LOOK OF FEAR
IN HER FACE BROKE MY HEART.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.108
THIS RIGHT HERE WAS WHERE,
WHEN WE MOVED INTO THE HOUSE,

04:03.110 --> 04:04.876
OUR ATTIC ONLY HAD ONE ENTRY,

04:04.878 --> 04:06.211
AND THIS ATTIC,
YOU COULDN'T GET INTO,

04:06.213 --> 04:08.780
SO I CUT OUT THE ATTIC
TO GET IT UP THERE,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.915
AND WHEN I LIFTED
THE TOP OUT TO MOVE IT,

04:10.917 --> 04:12.850
A RAZOR KNIFE CAME FLYING OUT
OF THE ATTIC.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.119
I MEAN, IT ALMOST HIT ME.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.653
AND IT CAME OUT
PRETTY FORCEFULLY TO WHERE,

04:15.655 --> 04:17.221
I MEAN, IT BANGED...

04:17.224 --> 04:19.624
...ALMOST LIKE IF A BOOBY TRAP
WAS SET UP OR SOMETHING.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.926
BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE WAY IT CAME OUT,

04:21.928 --> 04:24.162
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS MEANT
TO HURT SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW?

04:24.164 --> 04:25.296
- OKAY.
- JEEZ.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.032
SO WAS IT SEALED
BECAUSE IT WAS PAINTED SHUT

04:27.034 --> 04:29.000
- OR SOMETHING, OR...
- YEAH.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.069
I HAVE NO CLUE WHY THEY...

04:31.071 --> 04:32.404
THIS HAS, LIKE, GOT A STAIR
ABOVE IT AND EVERYTHING,

04:32.406 --> 04:33.638
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WOULD EVEN ELIMINATE...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.039
- CLOSE THAT UP.
- ...A PERFECTLY GOOD ATTIC.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.341
SO WAIT, THIS IS THE THING
YOU PULL DOWN NORMALLY?

04:36.343 --> 04:37.842
YEAH, BUT THEY ELIMINATED IT.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.746
- ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
- THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
YEAH.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.615
ONCE WE STARTED RENOVATIONS
AND THE BOX CUTTER CAME DOWN,

04:43.617 --> 04:46.117
THAT WAS IT.
I JUST HAD THAT --

04:46.119 --> 04:49.621
IT SOLD ON ME THAT SOMETHING
IS WRONG IN THIS HOUSE.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.023
DO YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING
COMING FROM UP HERE?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.191
WE SLEEP ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE HOUSE, THOUGH,

04:53.193 --> 04:54.392
IS THE PROBLEM,
SO IT'S ALL...

04:54.394 --> 04:55.560
THAT'S THE HARD THING.
CAMERON'S THE ONLY ONE

04:55.562 --> 04:56.795
- THAT'S HERE BY HERSELF.
- YEAH.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.697
BUT LATELY, GAVIN
HAS BEEN SO SCARED

04:58.699 --> 05:00.631
HE'S BEEN SLEEPING
ON HAILEY'S FLOOR.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.303
DO YOU STAY IN HERE
ALL THE TIME, OR...

05:04.305 --> 05:07.372
MOSTLY I SLEEP IN
HAILEY'S ROOM WITH HER

05:07.374 --> 05:10.275
BECAUSE A FEW TIMES,
THE WASHER AND DRYER

05:10.277 --> 05:11.943
WOULD TURN ON IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.480
AND I'M WONDERING, "HOW IS THAT
THING TURNING ON BY ITSELF?"

05:15.482 --> 05:17.782
RIGHT.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.951
THE ROOM ON THE LEFT HERE
IS HAILEY'S BEDROOM.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.687
THIS IS WHERE SHE HAD
AN ENCOUNTER WITH A SHADOW MAN

05:22.689 --> 05:24.322
AND HID UNDER THE BLANKETS.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.258
BUT I'LL LET HER SAY
HER SIDE OF THE STORY.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.659
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT. SURE.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.563
SO ONE NIGHT,
I SAW THIS ORB,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.464
AND IT WAS JUST
HOVERING LIKE THIS.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.368
- OKAY, LIKE THIS?
- AND IT WAS BLINDING ME.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.503
I RAN OUT OF THE ROOM,
TURNED THE LIGHT ON,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.405
AND RAN INTO
MY PARENTS' ROOM.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.240
A COUPLE NIGHTS LATER...

05:42.242 --> 05:44.676
...I WOKE UP, AND...

05:44.678 --> 05:47.245
THERE'S THIS SMALL FIGURE
RIGHT THERE.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.480
OKAY.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.881
THAT WAS THE LAST THING
THAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.683
- THERE WAS MORE.
- WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?

05:52.685 --> 05:55.553
THERE WAS THIS SHADOW
STANDING THERE LIKE THIS,

05:55.555 --> 05:58.189
AND IT WAS HOVERING LIKE THAT.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.724
LIKE, CREEPING IN?

05:59.726 --> 06:01.426
GOD. OKAY.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.995
ALL RIGHT.
AND THIS IS YOUR ROOM?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.664
YEP.
THIS IS OUR BEDROOM HERE.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.831
OKAY.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.800
THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE CRAZINESS IS...

06:08.802 --> 06:10.234
- REALLY?
- ...HAPPENING.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.337
I WILL START TO SAY THE "C"
OVER HERE WITH THE LIGHTS ON IT,

06:12.339 --> 06:14.205
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK,
THAT GOES OFF.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.808
THE LIGHTS COME ON.
THERE'S AN ON AND OFF BUTTON.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.076
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

06:18.078 --> 06:22.647
DID ANYBODY PASS IN YOUR FAMILY
OR THAT YOU KNOW

06:22.649 --> 06:25.483
OR THAT YOU WERE CLOSE TO THAT
HAD THE NAME START WITH A "C"?

06:25.485 --> 06:28.019
OR LAST NAME START WITH A "C"?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.254
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

06:30.256 --> 06:31.756
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.625
AND THEN WHAT ELSE
HAPPENS IN HERE?

06:33.627 --> 06:37.963
ONE NIGHT, ALL THE SUDDEN
I GOT THIS WEIRD, EERIE FEELING.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.864
AND AS I'M LOOKING FORWARD,

06:39.866 --> 06:43.001
I'M WATCHING, LIKE,
A LITTLE BUTT IMPRINT GO DOWN.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.469
JEEZ.

06:44.471 --> 06:48.573
AND THEN, SECOND AFTER THAT,
I HEAR TALKING.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.042
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.045
SO HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU BEEN
HEARING, LIKE, VOICES?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.780
I'VE ONLY HEARD IT ONCE.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.782
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
HEAR VOICES?

06:57.784 --> 06:59.183
- NO.
- MNH-MNH?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.553
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
FORMER OCCUPANTS OR ANYTHING?

07:01.555 --> 07:02.787
I WOULD TRY TO LOOK INTO IT.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.023
I HAD MY FRIEND
WHO WAS A REALTOR,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.626
AND SHE COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING ON THAT.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.095
WHO DO YOU THINK IS HERE?

07:10.097 --> 07:13.331
I'D LIKE IT IF, LIKE,
IT WAS MY UNCLE MIKE.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.100
THAT WAY I KNOW THAT HE'S,
LIKE, ACTUALLY MISSING ME.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.770
I MEAN, HE COULD BE HERE
CHECKING IN ON YOU, YOU KNOW?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.239
THAT'S WHAT I...

07:21.241 --> 07:24.743
MOST PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THE ROLE
OF GODFATHER, YOU KNOW, LIGHTLY.

07:24.745 --> 07:28.679
BUT IT COULD BE MORE THAN
ONE PERSON, TOO.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.582
WHO DO YOU THINK THE ORB WAS?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.183
MY GRANDMA.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.652
HER SISTER PASSED AWAY.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.887
I CALLED HER "LALA."

07:35.889 --> 07:39.391
AND YOU IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT
IT WAS YOUR LALA?

07:39.393 --> 07:42.294
LALA. I HAD A FEELING
IT WAS THERE TO MAKE SURE

07:42.296 --> 07:44.529
THAT NOTHING BAD
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.230
SO THE LIGHT,
YOU THINK IT WAS LALA,

07:46.232 --> 07:48.366
WHICH IS YOUR
GRANDMOTHER'S SISTER, RIGHT?

07:49.570 --> 07:52.637
BUT THE SHADOW FIGURE,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA,

07:52.639 --> 07:55.239
LIKE, WHO YOU MIGHT
THINK IT IS?

07:55.241 --> 07:58.209
NO.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.244
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,

08:04.885 --> 08:06.518
I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD LOVE
TO JUST FOR Y'ALL

08:06.520 --> 08:09.086
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
AND GET THIS AWAY

08:09.088 --> 08:10.922
SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK
TO LIVING OUR NORMAL LIVES

08:10.924 --> 08:12.257
WITHOUT THE FEAR, YOU KNOW?

08:13.694 --> 08:15.427
THE KIDS ARE TERRIFIED,

08:15.429 --> 08:18.663
BUT THEY ALSO HOPE THEIR FAMILY
MEMBERS ARE THE ONES HERE.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.110
- THEY'RE FREAKED OUT.
- YEAH.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.311
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S
SET UP THESE CAMERAS.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.513
YEAH.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.616
AND LET'S SEE
WHAT IS IN THIS.

08:39.619 --> 08:40.784
BE CAREFUL, PLEASE.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.520
JEEZ.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.624
IT'S, LIKE, WOW THERE'S A BUNCH
OF CRAP OVER THERE, BUT...

08:46.626 --> 08:48.860
WHAT KIND OF CRAP?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.461
- GOD.
- WHAT IS IT?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.330
HOLD ON.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.298
I SEE THE OLD INSULATION.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.434
EW.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.803
- JUST PUT IT DOWN.
- IT'S MOLDY.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.809
I'M NOT KIDDING.
THIS IS, LIKE...

09:04.811 --> 09:07.378
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY, LIKE,
MOLDY PARTICLE BOARD.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.885
BALANCE THE --
I MEAN IF YOU COULD --

09:13.887 --> 09:16.120
THERE YOU GO, YEAH.
ANGLE IT UP LIKE THAT.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.523
KATE THOUGHT SHE HEARD
THE VOICE IN HER BEDROOM,

09:18.525 --> 09:22.961
SO I'M GOING TO PUT ONE
IN THE MASTER BEDROOM.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.129
ARE YOU BY THE MONITOR?

09:25.131 --> 09:26.297
YEAH. HOLD ON.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.732
I'M JUST WONDERING
IF YOU CAN MAKE SURE

09:27.734 --> 09:29.901
YOU CAN SEE THE "C" LIGHT.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.008
IS THERE
SOMEBODY OUTSIDE?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.888
HEY. I KEEP HEARING VOICES.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.890
- HEY, ADAM?
- YEAH?

09:52.892 --> 09:54.792
- COME HERE.
- I'M COMING.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.061
- HURRY UP!
- I'M COMING.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.564
OKAY. LIKE, SERIOUSLY,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.880
HEY. I KEEP HEARING VOICES.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.883
- HEY, ADAM?
- YEAH?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.785
- COME HERE.
- I'M COMING.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.054
- HURRY UP!
- I'M COMING.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.424
OKAY. LIKE, SERIOUSLY,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.994
I KEEP A VOICE IN HERE.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.617
LET'S START IN HERE.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.161
IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE
IN THIS HOUSE,

11:04.163 --> 11:06.598
AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY,

11:06.600 --> 11:09.334
IF YOU STAND IN FRONT
OF THIS, YOU'LL BE SEEN.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.069
THE S.L.S. CAMERA USES
INFRARED LIGHT

11:11.071 --> 11:14.706
THAT ALLOWS US TO SEE THINGS
NOT VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.776
IF SOMETHING'S HERE,
IT WON'T BE ABLE TO HIDE.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.913
SO HERE, WATCH THIS.
SEE HOW...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.719
TIM, STAND UP FOR A SECOND.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.021
SEE HOW THIS GUY LOOKS?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.690
THAT'S MY FRIEND, TIM.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.693
SEE HOW I CAN SEE HIM
AND HE'S WAVING?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.195
SEE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE THERE?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.897
WELL, YOU CAN DO THAT, TOO.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.500
HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING
TO KATE AND MIKE

11:42.502 --> 11:44.903
AND HAILEY AND CAM?

11:49.675 --> 11:53.477
OKAY. I'VE GOT ONE
IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.547
CAN YOU WAVE LIKE THIS?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.949
CAN YOU DO THAT?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.723
THERE WE GO.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.958
GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.393
THAT'S PERFECT.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.330
GOOD JOB.
I CAN SEE YOU WAVING.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.834
NOW CAN YOU WALK TOWARD US?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.869
YOU CAN COME CLOSER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.371
CAN YOU REACH OUT?
TOUCH MY HAND.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.208
- JEEZ. IT MOVED.
- CAN YOU TELL HER...

12:24.210 --> 12:26.477
- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. 
- THERE'S TWO?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.980
THERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.188
GONE.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.657
THAT WAS REALLY CRAZY
BECAUSE I WAS, LIKE...

12:39.659 --> 12:40.858
WAIT, DID IT RAISE
ITS HAND?

12:40.860 --> 12:43.193
...IT **** WAVED AT ME.

12:43.195 --> 12:46.563
THAT'S WHY I WAS, LIKE...
I'M, LIKE...

12:46.565 --> 12:48.900
YOU RECORDED IT, YEAH?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.468
OKAY. WATCH THIS.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.372
- THERE IT IS.
- MY GOD.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.708
<i>CAN YOU WAVE LIKE THIS?</i>

12:57.710 --> 13:00.144
<i>GOOD JOB. THAT'S PERFECT.</i>

13:00.146 --> 13:02.147
<i>THAT'S PERFECT. GOOD JOB.</i>

13:02.149 --> 13:03.848
WHAT?!

13:03.850 --> 13:07.184
MIND-BLOWING ANOMALY
ON THE S.L.S. CAMERA.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.521
ANOTHER STRANGE ASPECT OF THAT

13:09.523 --> 13:12.790
WAS A LARGER ANOMALY APPEARED
IN FRAME.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.727
AND IT WAS ALMOST, LIKE, HOLDING
THE HAND OF THE SMALLER ONE.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.497
AND THAT IS A BIG CLUE FOR US.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.066
IT COULD MEAN THESE ENTITIES
ARE SOMEHOW ATTACHED

13:22.068 --> 13:23.434
OR EVEN RELATED.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.971
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I'VE SEEN
ON AN S.L.S. CAMERA

13:26.973 --> 13:29.240
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.541
SO YES, SOMETHING IS HERE,

13:30.543 --> 13:34.311
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AND WHY.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.214
SO YOU PROBABLY SPENT
A LONG TIME

13:36.216 --> 13:38.983
TRYING TO GET
SOMEONE'S ATTENTION,

13:38.985 --> 13:40.418
AND NOW WE'RE HERE
TO TALK TO YOU

13:40.420 --> 13:43.354
AND WE CAN SEE YOU, LIKE,
ON THE DEVICE

13:43.356 --> 13:47.324
AND WE CAN HEAR YOU
ON THIS THING.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.528
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOUR NAME IS?

13:53.933 --> 13:56.534
DO YOU LIKE
TURNING ON THIS "C" LIGHT?

13:58.638 --> 14:01.439
WHY DO YOU LIKE THIS LIGHT?

14:01.441 --> 14:04.576
IS IT BECAUSE YOUR NAME
STARTS WITH "C"?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.279
ALL RIGHT. LET'S LISTEN.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.889
IT'S VERY QUIET,

14:18.891 --> 14:20.891
BUT WE DID GET
THAT CRAZY ANOMALY.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.260
I MEAN, YEAH.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.827
OKAY. SO...

14:23.829 --> 14:26.530
LET'S REGROUP AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S NEXT ON THE AGENDA.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.399
- OKAY.
- PLUS RESEARCH, RIGHT?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.067
SO MUCH RESEARCH.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.037
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEIR...

14:33.039 --> 14:35.840
- LET'S GO DOWN THERE.
- ...FAMILY IS NOT ANY CLUE.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.674
I'VE SEEN THINGS
ON THE S.L.S. CAMERA BEFORE,

14:37.676 --> 14:40.244
BUT HAVING SOMETHING ACTUALLY
MIMIC WHAT WE'RE DOING...

14:40.246 --> 14:41.879
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
TO HAPPEN ON NIGHT ONE,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.681
IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.854
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS
ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSE.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.622
WE GOT TWO ANOMALIES
ON THE CAMERA LAST NIGHT,

14:51.624 --> 14:53.157
BUT NOTHING WAS TALKING.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.360
IT COULD BE THE FAMILY
OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE,

14:56.362 --> 14:58.129
SO I'M GOING TO GO
DO SOME RESEARCH

14:58.131 --> 15:01.032
AND FOCUS ON THE HISTORY
OF THE AREA.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.403
SO I WENT TO THE LIBRARY,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.605
AND THERE'S THREE THINGS
THAT POPPED OUT TO ME.

15:07.607 --> 15:11.175
THE COLONY OF NEW SMYRNA
WAS CALLED TURNBULL COLONY.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.511
AND IT WAS IN, LIKE, 1777.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.214
IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER,
UTTER FAILURE.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.582
THERE WAS 1,200 PEOPLE,
AND IT WAS SO BAD

15:18.584 --> 15:20.684
THAT THEY UP AND LEFT
TO ST. AUGUSTINE.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.187
WHEN THEY GOT HERE,
THE SEMINOLE INDIANS WERE HERE,

15:23.189 --> 15:25.756
AND THERE WAS THIS WHOLE PUSHOUT
OF THE SEMINOLE INDIANS,

15:25.758 --> 15:28.426
ESPECIALLY DURING
THE CIVIL WAR AND AFTER THAT.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.696
AND SO THEY, LIKE, LITERALLY
DROVE THEM OUT OF HERE,

15:31.698 --> 15:34.065
WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT
CAME UP, AND THEN THE CIVIL WAR.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.266
I MEAN, THERE WAS
A HORRIBLE BATTLE

15:35.268 --> 15:36.734
THAT HAPPENED
DURING THE CIVIL WAR,

15:36.736 --> 15:40.571
BUT IT WAS THE WORST HIT
FOR THE CONFEDERATES
IN THAT TIME PERIOD.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.239
- YEAH. LET'S USE IT.
- GREAT.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.576
THIS NEW INFORMATION

15:45.578 --> 15:48.679
WILL HELP GUIDE
TONIGHT'S INVESTIGATION.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.682
WE GOT THE MOST ACTIVITY
IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.417
BUT WE'RE GETTING STARTED
IN THE KIDS' ROOMS,

15:53.419 --> 15:56.020
SINCE GAVIN IS SCARED TO BE
IN THERE ALONE.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.058
ALL RIGHT.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.595
SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO
AN E.V.P. SESSION IN HERE.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.566
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING

16:08.568 --> 16:12.270
YOU NEED TO SAY TO US?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.241
DID SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN HERE?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.213
WERE YOU HERE BEFORE
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.352
WERE YOU A PART OF
A WAR HERE?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.056
LET'S PLAY THIS BACK.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.564
NO.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.767
NOTHING ON THE CIVIL WAR
OR HISTORY.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.103
YEAH. NOTHING ON
THE S.L.S. CAMERA,

16:46.105 --> 16:48.906
AND WE GOT TWO OF THOSE
YESTERDAY.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.576
WHAT OTHER ACTIVITY
HAVE THEY EXPERIENCED?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.111
THEY DO HAVE ALL THAT
"C" LIGHT ACTIVITY.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.680
I'M GONNA GO GRAB THAT.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.883
WE'RE GONNA INCORPORATE
THAT "C" LIGHT FIXTURE

16:59.885 --> 17:01.051
IN OUR INVESTIGATION

17:01.053 --> 17:03.086
JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD
SO MANY INSTANCES

17:03.088 --> 17:05.123
WHERE IT'S TURNED ON BY ITSELF.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.704
I'M GOING TO TWIST
SOME OF THE BULBS

17:20.705 --> 17:23.106
AND SEE IF ANYTHING HERE
INTERACTS WITH IT.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.611
WHY ARE YOU IN THIS PART
OF THE HOUSE?

17:32.218 --> 17:35.853
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SCARE THIS FAMILY?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.227
DO YOU LIVE HERE?

17:57.610 --> 18:01.345
I THOUGHT YOU DID
THREE OF THEM.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.514
SO ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN
SCREWED BACK IN?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.783
ONE OF THEM
GOT SCREWED BACK IN.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.734
DID I UNDO THREE
OF THOSE BULBS IN THE "C"?

18:27.540 --> 18:30.207
I THOUGHT SO. WAIT.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.676
I THOUGHT YOU DID
THREE OF THEM.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.080
SO ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN
SCREWED BACK IN?

18:36.082 --> 18:38.349
ONE OF THEM
GOT SCREWED BACK IN.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.527
IF THOSE LIGHTS ARE GOING OFF,

18:50.529 --> 18:52.897
WE COULD FINALLY BE
CONNECTING WITH SOMETHING.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.406
IT WAS ALREADY TWO.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.609
IT MUST HAVE FLIPPED BACK
ON WHEN I SAT IT DOWN.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.115
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS PARANORMAL.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.618
I THINK WHEN I SAT IT DOWN,
AND THEN WHEN I WALKED BY,

19:14.620 --> 19:18.289
IT WENT OUT AGAIN.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.557
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
VERY COOL.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.793
MAYBE WE GOT SOMETHING
ON THE RECORDER.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.774
LET'S TRY THE KITCHEN,
WHERE KATE'S HAIR WAS PULLED.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.981
SO SHE'S HERE. SHE'S DOING
BOTTLE STUFF, RIGHT?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.817
AND SHE CLOSES THIS,
AND THEN SHE SEES...

19:46.819 --> 19:48.886
AND SHE SEES A SECTION
OF HER HAIR GO...

19:48.888 --> 19:50.754
- AND IT WAS ON THIS...YEAH.
- THIS.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.890
AND THEN AT THAT TIME,
SHE LOOKS BACK,

19:52.892 --> 19:56.294
AND THE PAPER TOWEL ROLL...
- IS LIKE THIS.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.994
IF YOU CAN MANIPULATE
THIS PAPER TOWEL ROLL,

19:57.996 --> 19:59.930
WE JUST WANT YOU
TO PULL IT OFF

19:59.932 --> 20:02.366
AND DISCONNECT IT FROM
THIS THING.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.850
CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME?

20:19.852 --> 20:24.454
WERE YOU HIDING IN THE ATTIC
THIS WHOLE TIME?

20:24.456 --> 20:26.290
AND THEN THEY FOUND YOU?

20:28.293 --> 20:30.528
LET'S LISTEN.

21:18.143 --> 21:22.113
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO HAS INTERACTED WITH HAILEY.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.018
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF HAILEY'S FAMILY?

21:28.221 --> 21:29.854
LALA, IS THAT YOU?

21:32.525 --> 21:34.392
DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE
NAMED MIKE?

21:36.528 --> 21:40.698
ARE YOU GAVIN'S GODFATHER?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.266
LET'S PLAY THIS BACK.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.918
WHAT WAS THAT?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.223
- YEAH.
- YEAH. WHAT WAS THAT?

22:12.731 --> 22:13.964
IS THAT, LIKE, A, "YEAH"
OR SOMETHING?

22:13.966 --> 22:15.399
IT ALMOST SOUNDS
LIKE IT SAYS, "YEAH."

22:15.401 --> 22:17.768
<i>- MAYBE.</i> IT'S SO FAINT.
- BUT EVEN THAT IS SO FAINT.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.304
I WOULD NOT EVEN
PLAY THAT TO THEM

22:20.306 --> 22:22.072
UNLESS WE GOT SOMETHING
ELSE BACKING IT UP.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.974
WHAT IS GOING ON?

22:25.878 --> 22:28.912
WE NEED TO REGROUP,
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

22:28.914 --> 22:32.048
WHO COULD BE HERE
HAUNTING THIS HOUSE.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.735
PRETTY HEAVILY,

22:51.737 --> 22:53.237
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD
TO THE DEEDS OFFICE

22:53.239 --> 22:55.539
TO FIND OUT WHO
THE FORMER OWNERS ARE,

22:55.541 --> 22:58.408
HOW LONG THEY LIVED HERE,
AND THEN MAYBE DO

22:58.410 --> 23:00.344
SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
ON THEM, THEMSELVES.

23:07.453 --> 23:11.622
SO NOW I FOUND OUT
SOMETHING WILD TODAY

23:11.624 --> 23:13.056
ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.593
OBVIOUSLY, I WENT THROUGH --
I FOUND ALL THE OWNERS

23:15.595 --> 23:17.494
WHO OWNED THIS PLACE BEFORE.
- RIGHT.

23:17.496 --> 23:20.797
THERE WAS A COUPLE WHO LIVED
HERE -- EDNA AND PAUL COWELLS.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.632
- YES.
- THE LAST NAME IS "C."

23:22.634 --> 23:24.268
RIGHT. AND THEY KEEP MESSING
WITH THE "C."

23:24.270 --> 23:26.002
SO...

23:50.629 --> 23:53.497
AND IT IS FILLED WITH
MOLD AND MILDEW...

23:53.499 --> 23:55.598
- GOD.
- ...FOR YEARS.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.001
ULTIMATELY, EDNA DIED

23:58.003 --> 24:01.872
OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE
LUNG DISEASE.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.407
ASSOCIATED WITH
MOLD AND MILDEW?

24:03.409 --> 24:06.610
SHE WAS CONVINCED THIS PLACE
WAS MAKING HER SO SICK.

24:06.612 --> 24:10.881
HER HUSBAND ALSO DIED OF
A HEART ATTACK IN THE HOUSE.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.182
LOOK, IT'S LIKE,

24:12.184 --> 24:14.651
"MRS. COWELLS HAD WATER DRAINAGE
AND MILDEW PROBLEMS

24:14.653 --> 24:16.086
"SINCE THE HOUSE WAS BUILT,
AND WILL CONTINUE

24:16.088 --> 24:18.188
"TO HAVE PROBLEMS PER
COUNTY AND CITY STUDIES.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.723
"SHE ALSO SAYS
THAT THE MILDEW PROBLEM

24:19.725 --> 24:22.292
THAT SHE IS HAVING HAS AFFECTED
HER LUNGS AND HER HEALTH."

24:22.294 --> 24:23.860
WOW.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.262
SO I STARTED DOING
SOME RESEARCH...

24:25.264 --> 24:28.599
- RIGHT.
- ...ON MOLD AND MILDEW PROBLEMS.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.300
RIGHT.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.404
ONE OF THE METHODS THAT THEY USE
TO KEEP MOLD OR MILDEW IN PLACE

24:34.406 --> 24:36.506
IS CALLED
AN ENCAPSULATION TECHNIQUE,

24:36.508 --> 24:39.076
WHERE THEY PAINT OVER
EVERYTHING ON THE WOOD,

24:39.078 --> 24:42.246
THEY SEAL THE WOOD, AND THEN
THEY SEAL IT INTO A SPOT.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.715
- YEP. INTO THE ATTIC.
- RING A BELL?

24:44.717 --> 24:47.518
THIS ATTIC YOU COULDN'T GET
INTO, SO I CUT OUT THE ATTIC,

24:47.520 --> 24:49.687
AND WHEN I LIFTED
THE TOP OUT TO MOVE IT,

24:49.689 --> 24:51.789
A RAZOR KNIFE CAME FLYING OUT
OF THE ATTIC AT ME

24:51.791 --> 24:53.056
AND ALMOST HIT ME.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.325
GOD.

25:09.809 --> 25:14.144
I STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH
ON MOLD AND MILDEW PROBLEMS.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.612
RIGHT.

25:15.614 --> 25:19.716
ONE OF THE METHODS THAT THEY USE
TO KEEP MOLD OR MILDEW IN PLACE

25:19.718 --> 25:21.918
IS CALLED
AN ENCAPSULATION TECHNIQUE,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.521
WHERE THEY PAINT OVER
EVERYTHING ON THE WOOD,

25:24.523 --> 25:27.691
THEY SEAL THE WOOD, AND THEN
THEY SEAL IT INTO A SPOT.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.392
- YEP. INTO THE ATTIC.
- RING A BELL?

25:29.394 --> 25:30.827
- YEAH. INTO THAT ATTIC.
- YEAH.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.597
I CALLED THE MOLD SPECIALIST
TO COME OUT IN THE MORNING

25:33.599 --> 25:36.133
TO SEE WHAT THE SITUATION IS
WITH THIS HOUSE.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.770
THAT'S SO DANGEROUS.
THAT IS SO DANGEROUS.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.138
THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING.
YOU KNOW,

25:41.140 --> 25:42.405
ARE THEY TRYING
TO GET THEIR ATTENTION

25:42.407 --> 25:43.874
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED
FOR THEM,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.542
NOW THAT THEY HAVE
ALL THESE KIDS IN THE HOUSE?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.710
YEAH. YEAH.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.878
ARE THEY TRYING TO BE
LIKE, "LEAVE"?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.046
LIKE, TRYING TO
SCARE THEM OUT?

25:49.048 --> 25:50.214
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.382
DO MIKE AND KATE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

25:51.384 --> 25:52.616
- I BET THEY DON'T KNOW.
- I MEAN, THAT'S --

25:52.618 --> 25:55.418
THAT WILL MAKE THEM WANT
TO MOVE IN A HEARTBEAT.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.221
MY HOPE...
MY HOPE IS THAT SOMEONE

25:58.223 --> 26:00.757
WHO BOUGHT THE HOUSE TOOK
CARE OF THESE ISSUES...

26:00.759 --> 26:02.392
- RIGHT.
- ...AND THAT IT'S FINE.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.394
WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW --
IF THEY ARE HAUNTING THIS HOUSE,

26:04.396 --> 26:05.896
WE HAVE TO LET THEM
KNOW THAT WE HEAR YOU

26:05.898 --> 26:07.030
AND WE WILL DELIVER
THE MESSAGE.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.365
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.466
I THINK THEY NEED TO KNOW
THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION

26:09.468 --> 26:12.836
BESIDES SCARING THEM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

26:20.478 --> 26:23.279
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS NOW FOR 20 YEARS

26:23.281 --> 26:26.383
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.318
SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS
HEAVILY TONIGHT

26:28.320 --> 26:29.753
ON PAUL AND EDNA COWELLS,

26:29.755 --> 26:32.590
THE FORMER HOME OWNERS,
AS WE INVESTIGATE.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.693
SO WHAT DO YOU SEE?

26:36.695 --> 26:39.696
WELL, I SEE WOOD.

26:39.698 --> 26:43.666
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN TREATED
'CAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN SANDED.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.569
WHAT ABOUT INSULATION?

26:45.571 --> 26:48.404
THERE'S INSULATION.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.274
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK
THE MOLD GUY IN THE MORNING.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.277
I'M HOPING THAT IT WAS
JUST TAKEN CARE OF...

26:54.279 --> 26:56.112
YEAH. I HOPE SO.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.715
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO INVESTIGATING.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.084
I'M READY.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.356
WE GOT A VERY FAINT E.V.P.
LAST NIGHT IN HAILEY'S ROOM,

27:06.358 --> 27:08.826
AND SHE REPORTED SEEING
TWO SHADOW FIGURES,

27:08.828 --> 27:11.895
WHICH MATCHED WHAT WE CAPTURED
THE FIRST NIGHT.

27:11.897 --> 27:14.831
THERE WAS THIS SHADOW
STANDING THERE LIKE THIS

27:14.833 --> 27:17.767
AND IT WAS HOVERING LIKE THAT.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.770
SO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN
CAPTURE ANYTHING

27:19.772 --> 27:22.839
ON THE S.L.S. CAMERA
OR THE RECORDER.

27:22.841 --> 27:24.073
- ALL RIGHT.
- SO LET'S SEE IF...

27:24.075 --> 27:26.043
LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE HERE.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.014
ALL RIGHT,
SO THIS IS AMY AND ADAM,

27:31.016 --> 27:33.383
AND WE ARE
IN HAILEY'S ROOM.

27:36.454 --> 27:41.859
DID SOMEONE COME IN HERE
AND SHOW THEMSELVES TO HAILEY?

27:44.396 --> 27:46.797
IS THIS PAUL OR EDNA?

27:51.236 --> 27:53.137
CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME?

27:58.443 --> 28:00.077
LET'S LISTEN.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.502
"IT'S MIKE."

28:26.605 --> 28:28.672
"IT'S MIKE."

28:45.424 --> 28:47.191
<i>IT'S MIKE.</i>

28:49.328 --> 28:51.161
WHAT DID THAT SAY?

28:54.099 --> 28:56.533
"IT'S MIKE."

28:56.535 --> 28:57.901
"IT'S MIKE."

29:02.341 --> 29:04.875
YEAH.
100%. "IT'S MIKE."

29:07.112 --> 29:08.312
YEAH.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.581
WELL, MIKE ANSWERED.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.984
MIKE, I MEAN, DIDN'T WE GET
AN ANSWER LAST NIGHT FROM MIKE?

29:14.986 --> 29:16.853
- GODFATHER.
- YEAH.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.355
- HE SAID "YES."
- YEAH.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.692
BUT IT WAS TOO FAINT TO SAY
FOR SURE IT WAS HIM.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.260
I THINK HE'S HERE,
ESPECIALLY WITH GAVIN.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.595
YEAH.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.530
LIKE, HE'S PROBABLY STILL
TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.867
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S SOMETHING
DANGEROUS HERE, LIKE MOLD.

29:30.869 --> 29:34.838
AND HE PROBABLY WILL ALWAYS
HANG AROUND AND POP IN.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.641
- FOR SURE.
- BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE HERE.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.442
BECAUSE THERE WAS
TWO ENTITIES

29:39.444 --> 29:41.478
THAT WE SAW
ON THE S.L.S. CAMERA.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.315
<i>- JEEZ.</i>
<i>- CAN YOU TELL HER...</i>

29:45.317 --> 29:47.851
<i>- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.</i>
<i>- THERE'S TWO?</i>

29:47.853 --> 29:49.719
THEY MATCH WHAT HAILEY SAW.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.354
SHOULD WE REACH OUT AND SEE?

29:51.356 --> 29:53.890
YEAH. LET'S SEE. ALL RIGHT.

29:53.892 --> 29:55.058
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE S.L.S.
BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM

29:55.060 --> 29:57.194
AND SEE IF
THEY COME BACK TO US?

29:57.196 --> 30:00.496
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TRY TO HAVE
A TALK WITH THEM.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.432
FOR SURE.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.908
I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE
TO ADDRESS PAUL AND EDNA.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.076
WE THINK YOU MIGHT BE HERE.

30:13.078 --> 30:16.313
WE KNOW WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
WITH THIS HOUSE.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.715
EDNA, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

30:18.717 --> 30:20.651
BUT I GOT
ALL YOUR NOTES TODAY.

30:20.653 --> 30:24.688
I GOT ALL THESE REPORTS
SAYING THAT YOU WERE

30:24.690 --> 30:30.293
SO CONCERNED WITH YOUR HEALTH
BECAUSE OF THIS HOUSE.

30:30.295 --> 30:33.397
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE HOUSE?
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

30:35.934 --> 30:38.702
WERE THEY EVER ABLE
TO FIX IT FOR YOU?

30:42.274 --> 30:45.742
I KNOW PAUL PASSED AWAY HERE.

30:45.744 --> 30:48.745
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK, RIGHT?

30:52.618 --> 30:56.419
WERE YOU REACHING OUT
TO HELP THIS FAMILY?

30:56.421 --> 30:59.155
I DON'T WANT TO BEG, BUT I'M
VERY NERVOUS FOR THIS FAMILY,

30:59.157 --> 31:01.958
KNOWING THIS INFORMATION.

31:01.960 --> 31:07.931
SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE,
<i>PLEASE</i> TALK TO US.

31:07.933 --> 31:08.965
ALL RIGHT. LET'S LISTEN.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.367
I HOPE SHE'S TALKING.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.303
HOPE SOMEONE'S TALKING.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.590
PLEASE GO BACK.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.859
AND HER VOICE SOUNDS...

31:40.866 --> 31:42.366
"YES."

31:45.070 --> 31:47.771
<i>WERE THEY EVER ABLE</i>
<i>TO FIX IT FOR YOU?</i>

31:53.578 --> 31:55.879
- DID IT SAY "MOLD"?
- MOLD! IT SAID "MOLD"!

31:55.881 --> 31:57.080
WAIT.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.090
IT SAYS "MOLD"!

32:18.469 --> 32:21.304
WE FINALLY STARTED TO GET
SOME E.V.P. RESPONSES,

32:21.306 --> 32:22.506
VERY CLEAR.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.307
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT
A COINCIDENCE.

32:24.309 --> 32:27.710
SO AT THIS POINT WE KNOW,
WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

32:27.712 --> 32:31.214
BUT HOW DO WE MAKE THEM
BACK OFF OF THIS FAMILY?

32:31.216 --> 32:33.216
MRS. COWELLS...

32:35.187 --> 32:36.519
WE THINK WE HEARD YOU.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.188
WE HEARD THE WORD "MOLD."

32:39.190 --> 32:41.191
WE HEARD YOU SAY "YES."

32:41.193 --> 32:44.293
WE'RE JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE
WHEN THEY OPENED THAT ATTIC,

32:44.295 --> 32:47.263
IT UPSET YOU?

32:47.265 --> 32:50.600
IT HAD BEEN SEALED UP
FOR A LONG TIME, RIGHT?

32:53.272 --> 32:55.839
AND NO ONE KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

32:55.841 --> 33:00.544
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE
UNTIL THEY OPENED UP THAT ATTIC.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.746
AND NOW THERE'S FOUR KIDS
IN THIS HOUSE,

33:02.748 --> 33:05.449
AND YOU THINK THAT WHAT'S UP
THERE COULD HURT THEM.

33:08.353 --> 33:12.421
THIS FAMILY, I DON'T THINK,
HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT

33:12.423 --> 33:16.859
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
OR THE MOLD.

33:16.861 --> 33:19.462
YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED
FOR THEIR SAFETY

33:19.464 --> 33:22.599
AND TO WANT TO HELP THEM.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.868
WE APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.

33:25.870 --> 33:28.472
PAUL, ARE YOU HERE?

33:32.444 --> 33:34.211
<i>MRS. COWELLS...</i>

33:34.213 --> 33:36.713
WAIT. SCOOT OVER.
I NEED TO SIT WITH YOU.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.587
"YEAH."

33:44.589 --> 33:45.755
MY GOD.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.024
MY GOD.

34:04.943 --> 34:08.344
AT LEAST IT ADMITTED THAT
THE ATTIC PISSED IT OFF.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.344
<i>HER</i> OFF.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.047
IT'S HER.
IT SOUNDS FEMALE.

34:11.049 --> 34:16.219
WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT
EDNA MIGHT BE HERE, RIGHT?

34:16.221 --> 34:20.190
I THINK EDNA IS HERE.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.659
EDNA?
WE'VE RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE.

34:23.661 --> 34:28.697
WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, AND WE
WANT TO FIX THIS FOR EVERYONE.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.668
AND WE HAVE CALLED
A PROFESSIONAL IN TOMORROW

34:31.670 --> 34:34.804
TO MAKE SURE IT IS
NOW SAFE FOR THIS FAMILY.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.409
WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
THAT WITHOUT YOU.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.878
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.955
WE DO HAVE
A MOLD EXPERT COMING.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.690
HE'S GOING TO DO AN INSPECTION
OF THE HOUSE AND LET US KNOW

34:54.692 --> 34:58.361
IF THERE'S ANY MOLD OR MILDEW
PRESENT AT THE MOMENT.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.096
THERE'S A FAMILY LIVING HERE
WITH FOUR KIDS,

35:00.098 --> 35:01.564
SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO...

35:01.566 --> 35:03.399
IF THERE IS SOMETHING, I JUST
WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.335
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S START MY THING.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.780
THE HUMIDITY IS VERY HIGH.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.316
IT SHOULD STAY BELOW 60%.

35:20.318 --> 35:23.386
IT IS NOW 73 PERCENT,
THIS HUMIDITY.

35:23.388 --> 35:25.788
- WOW.
- THAT'S HIGH.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.835
HERE'S MORE AREA
WITH WATER GETTING IN.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.504
THAT LOOKS LIKE MOLD.

35:41.506 --> 35:43.005
YEAH. THAT'S DEFINITELY.

35:43.007 --> 35:46.109
JEEZ.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.911
YEAH.
AND THIS IS THE BABY'S ROOM.

35:59.958 --> 36:03.292
HERE'S MORE AREA
WITH WATER GETTING IN.

36:03.294 --> 36:04.961
THAT LOOKS LIKE MOLD.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.462
YEAH. THAT'S DEFINITELY.

36:06.464 --> 36:10.200
JEEZ.

36:10.202 --> 36:13.469
- YEAH
- AND THIS IS THE BABY'S ROOM.

36:13.471 --> 36:17.340
SHOULD BE FAIRLY OKAY EXCEPT
FOR THE PINK BABY'S ROOM...

36:17.342 --> 36:19.008
- OKAY.
- ...WITH THE VISIBLE MOLD.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.912
SHOULD HAVE IT CLEANED UP.
THE TOXINS AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.147
WELL, THANK YOU.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.448
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT
ON SHORT NOTICE.

36:25.450 --> 36:26.516
YOU'RE WELCOME.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.518
AND YEAH, WE'LL LET
THE FAMILY KNOW.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.356
THE INSPECTOR
JUST CONFIRMED

36:33.358 --> 36:34.523
THAT MOLD IS IN THE HOUSE,

36:34.525 --> 36:36.660
AND THAT IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

36:36.662 --> 36:40.297
I HOPE MIKE AND KATE ARE READY
FOR EVERYTHING WE'VE FOUND.

36:40.299 --> 36:44.601
I THINK THAT THE OUTCOME HERE
WAS NOT ANYTHING

36:44.603 --> 36:46.202
THAT WE'VE EVER
EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.403
YEAH. EVER.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.539
AND I THINK THAT THE MAIN THING
IS WE WANTED

36:49.541 --> 36:51.441
TO REACH OUT TO YOUR FAMILY

36:51.443 --> 36:53.209
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO KNOW

36:53.211 --> 36:56.145
THAT WE THINK WE DID
GET A RESPONSE FROM SOMEONE

36:56.147 --> 36:57.413
THAT YOU GUYS
WANTED TO HEAR FROM.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.749
WHAT?

36:59.751 --> 37:02.118
SO, UM, WE WANNA
PLAY THAT FOR YOU.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.293
HOLY ****!

37:10.295 --> 37:11.627
I'M SORRY.

37:11.629 --> 37:13.262
I'M SORRY. THAT WAS
CLEAR AS DAY.

37:13.264 --> 37:14.697
- THAT WAS MIKE.
- MY GOSH.

37:14.699 --> 37:17.366
- MY GOD.
- MY GOD.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.201
- I'M SORRY. I'M CRYING.
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S FINE.

37:19.203 --> 37:20.570
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.242
- IT'S A GOOD FEELING.
- IT'S AWESOME. YEAH.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.944
YEAH. I LOVE IT
THAT HE'S HERE.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.245
THAT MAKES ME
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.513
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT WAS
HIS ONE MISSION BEFORE,

37:30.515 --> 37:33.048
I FEEL LIKE, TO BE HIS GODFATHER
AND WATCH OVER HIM.

37:33.050 --> 37:34.217
THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER.
YEAH.

37:34.219 --> 37:37.520
THAT MAKES ME FEEL,
LIKE, SO GREAT.

37:37.522 --> 37:40.189
I JUST CAN'T --
I KNEW I WASN'T NUTS, DUDE.

37:40.191 --> 37:43.559
I KNEW I WASN'T CRAZY.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.095
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.965
SERIOUSLY.
BECAUSE I KNEW IT.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.234
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT IN MY HEART.

37:51.236 --> 37:52.535
IT'S SUCH A RELIEF.

37:52.537 --> 37:53.803
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CLEAR
IT WAS, THOUGH.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.538
I KNOW.
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.541
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT IT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

37:58.543 --> 38:02.212
IT'S NOT CRAZY AT ALL.
BUT WE HAVE MORE TO TELL YOU.

38:02.214 --> 38:04.847
THIS ONE WAS IN
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.782
THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
IS CALLED THE S.L.S. CAMERA.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.651
IT STANDS FOR
STRUCTURED LIGHT SENSOR.

38:08.653 --> 38:12.388
SO IT USES THE SAME TECHNOLOGY
AS, LIKE, A VIDEO GAME,

38:12.390 --> 38:13.757
WHERE IT WOULD...

38:13.759 --> 38:16.059
LIKE, YOU ARE MOVING,
AND IT SEES YOU MOVING

38:16.061 --> 38:17.594
AND YOU BECOME
THE CHARACTER, RIGHT?

38:17.596 --> 38:18.794
OKAY.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.029
SO WHEN WE TAKE
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT,

38:20.031 --> 38:22.832
AND WE FOCUS IT ON NOTHING,

38:22.834 --> 38:25.869
AND IT REGISTERS SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE A PERSON...

38:25.871 --> 38:28.505
- GOT YOU.
- ...IT SHOWS UP ON OUR CAMERA.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.972
- YEAH. I LIKE IT.
- OKAY.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.740
SO IT'S A REALLY COOL
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.376
SO USUALLY,
WHEN THIS HAPPENS,

38:33.378 --> 38:35.312
YOU JUST SEE THEM
STANDING THERE,

38:35.314 --> 38:36.579
AND THEY'RE, LIKE,
DOING THEIR OWN THING,

38:36.581 --> 38:38.882
BUT IN THIS CASE, WHEN YOU
WATCH BACK THIS VIDEO,

38:38.884 --> 38:42.151
IT'S LIKE A "SIMON SAYS"
KIND OF THING. YEAH.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.520
THAT IS THE ENTRANCE
TO THE BATHROOM RIGHT HERE.

38:44.522 --> 38:45.788
I SEE HIM.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.224
<i>I HAVE ONE IN THE BATHROOM</i>
<i>RIGHT NOW.</i>

38:48.226 --> 38:51.227
<i>CAN YOU WAVE LIKE THIS?</i>

38:52.964 --> 38:55.698
- WATCH. WATCH.
<i>- THERE WE GO.</i>

38:55.700 --> 38:56.866
<i>GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB.</i>

38:56.868 --> 38:58.401
- MY GOD.
- MY GOD!

38:58.403 --> 39:00.636
<i>- THAT'S PERFECT.</i>
- YEAH. IT WAVES BACK AT US.

39:00.638 --> 39:03.138
<i>I CAN SEE YOU WAVING.</i>

39:03.140 --> 39:06.308
- THIS IS NUTS.
<i>- NOW CAN YOU WALK TOWARD US?</i>

39:06.310 --> 39:08.177
- IT STARTS TRYING TO COME...
- IT STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.445
YEAH, LIKE IT'S TRYING
TO LISTEN.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.880
MY GOD.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.515
ALL RIGHT.
NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.582
THIS IS
BACK IN THE BATHROOM.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.818
<i>HI. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?</i>

39:15.820 --> 39:19.322
YOU KIND OF SEE THE ONE
THAT'S CLOSER TO US REACH OUT

39:19.324 --> 39:23.660
TO THE OTHER ONE AND SORT OF,
LIKE, KIND OF EXIT WITH THEM.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.629
- LIKE, BEING LIKE, "COME. COME."
- "COME ON."

39:26.631 --> 39:28.231
LIKE, "LET'S COME
OUT OF THIS," YOU KNOW?

39:28.233 --> 39:29.899
HAILEY MENTIONED
SEEING SHADOW FIGURES,

39:29.901 --> 39:32.668
AND WE THINK THIS MIGHT BE THEM.

39:32.670 --> 39:33.970
THIS IS INSANE.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.872
THIS IS SO, LIKE -- MY MIND
IS BLOWN RIGHT NOW.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.107
THIS IS SO...

39:38.109 --> 39:39.275
WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO WOULD BE HERE,

39:39.277 --> 39:40.577
WHO WOULD BE TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION,

39:40.579 --> 39:42.912
AND AS I WAS GOING
THROUGH THE DEEDS,

39:42.914 --> 39:46.015
I FOUND THIS REALLY
INTERESTING INFORMATION

39:46.017 --> 39:48.084
ABOUT EDNA AND PAUL,

39:48.086 --> 39:50.286
WHO LIVED HERE FOR SO LONG.

39:50.288 --> 39:54.124
THIS IS WHEN WE STARTED
ASKING ABOUT THE ATTIC.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.569
SHE SAID, "YEAH."

40:14.112 --> 40:17.446
- "YEAH."
- OKAY.

40:17.448 --> 40:18.981
SO, LIKE, IT...

40:18.983 --> 40:20.683
- IT PISSED HER OFF.
- ...INTERRUPTED HER? IT...

40:20.685 --> 40:23.786
I THINK, HONESTLY,
I THINK THAT SHE KNEW

40:23.788 --> 40:26.021
THERE WAS STUFF UP THERE.

40:26.023 --> 40:30.259
EDNA THOUGHT THIS HOUSE
WAS MAKING HER VERY SICK.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.763
THEY HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS HERE
WITH WATER GETTING IN THE HOUSE,

40:33.765 --> 40:36.799
MOLD, MILDEW,
THE HOUSE SETTLING,

40:36.801 --> 40:39.802
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
AFFECTING HER LUNGS,

40:39.804 --> 40:45.441
AND ULTIMATELY, SHE ENDED UP
DYING FROM CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.845
SO DO YOU THINK
ON THE S.L.S. CAMERA

40:49.847 --> 40:53.783
THAT THOSE TWO SPIRITS
WERE THE HOME OWNERS?

40:53.785 --> 40:56.785
I THINK IT WAS THEM.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.688
SO WE STARTED
REACHING OUT TO THEM.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.894
- MOLD?
- MOLD.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.396
I THINK THAT WHEN
YOU OPENED THAT ATTIC,

41:07.398 --> 41:08.965
AND THAT WAS KIND OF
AN AREA OF CONCERN,

41:08.967 --> 41:11.233
ESPECIALLY SINCE A LOT OF THAT
STUFF WAS STASHED UP THERE,

41:11.235 --> 41:14.103
I THINK THAT WAS AN ALARM
FOR THEM TO, LIKE,

41:14.105 --> 41:15.237
TRY TO PROBABLY
SCARE YOU OUT.

41:15.239 --> 41:17.240
GET MY ATTENTION.
SHE YANKED MY HAIR.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.374
SOMEONE DID.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.909
RIGHT. THEY'RE LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.111
- THEY'RE HELPING YOU.
- RIGHT.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.380
SO WE CALLED A MOLD INSPECTOR
INTO YOUR HOUSE,

41:24.382 --> 41:27.516
AND HE CAME HERE THIS MORNING,
AND HE DID FIND SOME MOLD.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.152
HE DID?

41:29.154 --> 41:30.986
HE FOUND SOME IN CHARLIE'S ROOM,
WHICH, SHE'S NOT IN THERE YET.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.454
THANK GOD.
THAT'S WHAT HE...

41:32.456 --> 41:34.224
HIS EXACT WORDS WERE, "THANK
GOD SHE'S NOT IN HERE YET."

41:34.226 --> 41:35.457
YEAH.

41:35.459 --> 41:36.592
IT'S STILL AT A POINT
WHERE YOU CAN CLEAN IT.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.295
AND I WILL SAY, LAST NIGHT,
WE SAT DOWN

41:39.297 --> 41:41.264
AND WE HAD A TALK
WITH PAUL AND EDNA.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.232
WE TOLD THEM EXACTLY WHAT
WAS GOING ON,

41:43.234 --> 41:44.467
EXACTLY WHY WE WERE HERE,

41:44.469 --> 41:46.602
AND THAT THEY DIDN'T
NEED TO WORRY

41:46.604 --> 41:49.038
AND THAT YOU GUYS WERE
TAKING CARE OF THINGS,

41:49.040 --> 41:52.742
AND I HONESTLY THINK PROBABLY
NOT A LOT WILL HAPPEN NOW.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.109
I'M SO THANKFUL FOR YOU GUYS.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.277
- TRULY...
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN AWESOME.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.013
TRULY THANKFUL.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.416
GAVIN'S GODFATHER, MIKE,
IS HERE WATCHING OUT FOR HIM,

42:00.418 --> 42:03.553
AND I'D BE WILING TO BET
HE'S GOING TO STICK AROUND.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.424
PAUL AND EDNA WERE COMPLETE
STRANGERS TO THIS FAMILY,

42:08.426 --> 42:12.861
BUT THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED
TO LET THEM KNOW OF THE DANGER

42:12.863 --> 42:15.397
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY
BE IN THEIR HOUSE.

42:15.399 --> 42:17.900
TRUTHFULLY, IF THEY HAD
NOT DONE ANY OF THIS,

42:17.902 --> 42:20.736
IF NONE OF THIS ACTIVITY
HAD HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE,

42:20.738 --> 42:24.040
THE FAMILY MIGHT NOT KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.
