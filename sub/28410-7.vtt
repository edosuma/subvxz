10:28.753 --> 10:30.546
{\an8}So, uh,

10:30.629 --> 10:32.048
{\an7}since that's
off your plate,

10:32.131 --> 10:33.924
{\an8}looks like Olivia and I
will see you tonight

10:34.008 --> 10:36.469
{\an8}at your sister's
birthday dinner.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.782
{\an8}And now, warrior.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.086
(bell rings)

11:10.169 --> 11:11.712
Look, I told you,
I had my account

11:11.796 --> 11:14.423
{\an3}under my ex-wife's
address.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.801
{\an1}I just need you to get
the papers out of there, okay?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.969
N-N-No, you listen.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.724
{\an6}(banging)

11:21.347 --> 11:23.724
(man grunting)

11:27.520 --> 11:29.772
(horn honks)

11:27.520 --> 11:29.772
{\an1}Lady,

11:29.855 --> 11:31.607
can you move?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.943
(horn honking)

11:34.026 --> 11:36.654
(panting)

11:57.883 --> 11:59.802
{\an1}(gasps)

11:59.885 --> 12:01.887
{\an1}(sighs)

12:03.347 --> 12:05.599
{\an3}Yo, Auntie A,
were you sleeping?

12:05.683 --> 12:06.809
'Cause that'd be weird.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.687
Um, no, I...

12:09.770 --> 12:11.814
{\an1}I was taking a moment,
that's it.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.149
{\an3}Right.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.320
Oh, God, you're taller.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.363
{\an3}Yep.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.116
{\an1}How is it
that you're taller?

12:22.199 --> 12:25.494
Well, I'm growing at a
normal rate, I guess,

12:25.578 --> 12:28.539
but you don't, uh,
see me very often.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.499
That's how that works.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.792
Hey, how crazy
was last night?

12:31.876 --> 12:34.462
There were meteors
all over the place.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.213
Kids at school are
obsessed with them.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.339
Yeah.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.677
A couple landed behind
this guy's house. It was crazy.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.846
"This guy"?

12:43.929 --> 12:47.475
{\an1}You went on
a little date, huh?

12:47.558 --> 12:50.019
What's wrong? What happened?

12:51.854 --> 12:55.566
Uh... he just, uh,

12:55.649 --> 12:57.651
he just got weird on me.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.487
That sucks.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.780
If only there was a way to
figure out which, which guys

13:01.864 --> 13:04.116
were gonna be assholes,
you know?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
(sighs)
I wish I could kick his ass.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.246
{\an3}(chuckles) And what good
would that do?

13:09.330 --> 13:11.165
Well, you know...

13:11.248 --> 13:13.042
Why do guys always
want to kick ass?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.627
'Cause we're dudes!

13:14.710 --> 13:16.670
{\an1}Thank you, Phil,
Olivia, I love it.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.339
{\an4}Cole, put this in
your bathroom.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.339
You're welcome.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.381
Yes, yes.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.509
{\an5}Those are awesome.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.509
(chuckles)

13:21.592 --> 13:25.387
Okay, and, oh,
what's next?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.847
{\an3}Oh, what on earth
could this be?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.182
{\an5}OLIVIA: No idea.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.182
I don't, I don't have any...

13:28.265 --> 13:30.017
{\an5}It's a James Patterson novel.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.017
Could we...?

13:30.100 --> 13:32.019
(laughter)

13:32.102 --> 13:34.188
{\an3}Um, the-the receipt's
on the bottom.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.232
I'm sure there's a fancier
skillet you would want.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.234
What is that?
That's a nine-inch, right?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.777
{\an1}I love it, Annie!
Thank you.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.570
{\an5}We need this. Mike.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.570
{\an1}Yeah.
That's a good one.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.531
{\an1}I could've used this bad boy
for that eggplant terrine,

13:43.614 --> 13:44.907
by the way.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.907
{\an3}Definitely.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.075
First time we had that
was in Paris, right?

13:46.158 --> 13:47.743
He wouldn't-- Sorry.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.411
{\an5}You go. No.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.411
{\an3}Do you want...?
You can tell it, I don't care.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.704
No. Love you.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.704
{\an3}I love you.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.749
{\an3}Uh, so, I go into the kitchen to
ask the chef for the recipe...

13:53.832 --> 13:54.750
{\an5}He means in French.

13:53.832 --> 13:54.750
(laughs): Right.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.252
Just get that in.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.755
But my-my-my French
is, uh-uh,<i> très mauvais.</i>

13:59.838 --> 14:01.715
{\an3}So-so, the chef
answered in English.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.093
{\an5}(laughter)

14:01.799 --> 14:04.093
Just to make a point.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.387
You should've had Martha ask.
Her French is amazing.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.597
And send her
into the den of louts

14:08.681 --> 14:09.765
that is a Parisian kitchen?

14:09.848 --> 14:11.475
No.<i> Non.</i>

14:09.848 --> 14:11.475
See?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.435
{\an6}MARTHA:
This is my big,
brave hero.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.396
{\an1}There are still some
good men out there, okay?

14:15.479 --> 14:17.731
{\an6}So, let's just
remember that, like...

14:15.479 --> 14:17.731
PHIL: Thank you.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.316
{\an5}Seriously, this
was so great.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.316
BOTH: Thank you.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.111
You know what's weird is terrine
isn't technically a-a pâté.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.239
Okay, can you mansplain that
to us some other time, dear?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.907
{\an5}Hey, man, get woke.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.907
(laughter)

14:26.991 --> 14:28.450
{\an4}MARTHA:
Wow.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.450
Okay.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.119
{\an1}Oh, Phil,

14:30.202 --> 14:31.912
Annie has been telling me
that she absolutely loves

14:31.996 --> 14:34.164
{\an3}her new job, so thank you
for that opportunity.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.751
Well, the new job loves her.
I mean, this girl is the best

14:37.835 --> 14:40.796
{\an1}entry-level person
they've had there in years.

14:40.879 --> 14:41.839
{\an1}Ah.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.257
{\an3}I'm thinking
of pairing her

14:43.340 --> 14:45.509
{\an3}with our best
project manager, Dylan.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.012
{\an5}MARTHA: Really?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.012
MIKE: Dylan.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.097
I mean, doesn't it sound like
a dream team, Annie? (chuckles)

14:50.180 --> 14:52.933
{\an5}(chuckles)

14:50.180 --> 14:52.933
MARTHA: Wow.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.643
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.643
What do you think, Anne?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.020
Does he have some potential?

14:59.565 --> 15:00.983
Annie?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.484
(lawn mower running outside)

15:02.568 --> 15:04.820
{\an5}(lawn mower clanks, stops)

15:02.568 --> 15:04.820
{\an1}LARRY:
Aah! Fuck!

15:04.903 --> 15:07.072
What was that?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.157
Larry, you okay?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.575
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.951
{\an1}It's kind of late
to be mowing,

15:11.035 --> 15:13.495
{\an5}isn't it?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.495
Yeah, well, the kids

15:13.579 --> 15:15.706
didn't do it again.
I told them to do it.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.541
{\an1}Jesus, Larry,
it's a mud pool.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.252
Is there something
in your water? Why's it red?

15:20.336 --> 15:21.837
I... I called water and power,

15:21.920 --> 15:22.921
they said it's
like this everywhere.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.507
{\an3}I mean, it seems harmless,
but it smells like shit.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.177
{\an4}MIKE:
Yeah, smells like it.
Hey, t-turn

15:28.260 --> 15:30.679
{\an5}the-the-the hose off.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.679
{\an3}You know, it's probably
a result of the

15:30.763 --> 15:31.847
{\an3}iron oxide
in the hose

15:31.930 --> 15:33.515
{\an3}interacting with the
oxygen in the air.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.433
{\an1}MARTHA:
You know what, I--

15:34.516 --> 15:35.517
{\an1}It sounds like you guys
have this handled.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.061
We have to go. I'm sorry.
Robyn's gonna be waiting.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.354
{\an5}I love you. I love you.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.354
I love you.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.229
{\an1}Thank you.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.229
{\an3}Go.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.565
{\an5}Yes. Bye, honey.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.565
Thank you for the present.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.693
{\an1}Hey, man, it-it stinks
and I can smell it in our house.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.986
Yes, I know that.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.659
{\an3}The sports car is so
tiny, my face is smooshed

15:51.742 --> 15:53.118
underneath the
steering wheel.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.371
{\an3}MARTHA: Oh, my God, Robyn.
You've got to be kidding me.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.706
{\an5}What did you do?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.706
We pulled over.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
{\an5}No, you... No, you did not.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
Right there,

15:59.625 --> 16:01.335
{\an5}off the highway.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.335
(laughter)

16:01.418 --> 16:02.586
Every once in a while,

16:02.670 --> 16:06.507
we'd see headlights and Clark
would be like, "Stop moving."

16:06.590 --> 16:11.595
My face is mushed and I'm like,
"Clark, we're married, it's okay

16:11.679 --> 16:13.055
that we do this!"

16:13.138 --> 16:14.223
(laughs) Yeah.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.599
MEN (chanting):
Shoot the stone!

16:15.683 --> 16:18.352
Shoot the stone!
Shoot the stone!

16:18.435 --> 16:20.020
Shoot the stone! Shoot
the stone! Shoot the stone!

16:20.104 --> 16:21.855
Come on, get after it.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.190
{\an1}MARTHA:
Are those meteorites?

16:23.273 --> 16:24.441
You guys, that is
Zeke the geek.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.194
{\an1}OLIVIA:
Yeah, he used to be

16:27.277 --> 16:28.529
{\an3}so bullied
in high school.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.906
{\an1}Well, it looks like
some things never change.

16:30.989 --> 16:34.076
{\an3}Forget about Zeke.
Who is that?

16:34.159 --> 16:36.120
I like your earrings...

16:36.203 --> 16:38.706
{\an3}He's the new guy
from Phil's office.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.208
{\an3}What? Is it?
Oh, it is.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.627
Dylan. The one Annie's

16:43.711 --> 16:47.548
{\an3}being "paired up" with.
(laughs)

16:47.631 --> 16:49.216
{\an5}Okay, okay, I'll stop.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.216
{\an1}ROBYN: What is wrong
with you guys?

16:49.299 --> 16:50.426
Invite him over here.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.927
{\an5}Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.927
No, no, no, no, no.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.095
Why?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.095
{\an1}Come on.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.304
We're having fun here.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.932
{\an1}Yeah, but, Annie,
he's hot.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.809
I bet he'd be good in bed.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.437
Not everything's
about sex, Martha.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.063
It's not?

17:03.147 --> 17:05.733
{\an3}(laughter)

17:08.694 --> 17:10.654
(clears throat) I need to--
I'm gonna get some air.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.656
{\an3}Oh...

17:10.738 --> 17:13.656
{\an1}Annie...

17:17.035 --> 17:18.287
Thanks, man.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.165
{\an3}ANNIE:
This must be Steve.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.791
{\an3}Shit.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.676
{\an3}Bold move. You know,
your mom's right inside.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.428
{\an1}Yeah, it's just
for a friend.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.138
{\an3}You know how many times your
mom and I used that line?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.432
{\an1}Yeah.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.851
I won't tell if you won't.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.855
{\an3}Hey, thanks
for being cool.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.691
{\an3}Just don't
drink it here.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.152
Nah, we're hanging on
my dad's boat, the <i> Achilles,</i>

17:50.235 --> 17:51.320
down by the docks.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.864
I wish I was 15.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.949
Be safe, okay?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.367
Yeah.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.495
Bye, Annie.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.707
CROWD (chanting): Shoot
the stone! Shoot the stone!

18:03.791 --> 18:05.375
Shoot the stone!
Shoot the stone!

18:05.459 --> 18:06.627
Shoot the stone!

18:06.710 --> 18:08.712
Shoot the stone!
Shoot the stone!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.798
{\an3}MAN: Come on, shoot it,
shoot it, shoot it! Yeah!

18:10.881 --> 18:12.007
Hey, my turn. My turn.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.675
No, man, you've had plenty.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.511
Zeke is wasted.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.180
BARTENDER: How about I get you a
nice glass of cold water, on me.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.515
I'll throw down, yeah.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.225
Get me another.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.852
I got to repeat myself? No.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.897
It's so sad when a dude
doesn't know his limits.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.191
{\an3}What is wrong
with them?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.068
It's just assholes
being assholes.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.070
(gasping)

18:33.153 --> 18:34.571
{\an5}What the hell?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.571
{\an3}Let's go.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.571
Yeah.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.073
{\an5}Come on.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.073
Wow, seriously, man?

18:36.156 --> 18:38.659
Okay, uh, I think
that's our cue.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.160
{\an5}What? No.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.160
We're gonna call it a night.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.537
Annie, we don't have to go.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
{\an5}Yes...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
{\an3}Come on.
Just one more...

18:43.247 --> 18:45.332
{\an5}Okay, we don't even
have the check.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.332
It's okay, I got it.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.501
{\an5}You got it? Okay.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.501
Yeah.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.503
{\an4}Think you're getting a little
aggressive, aren't you?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.503
{\an1}No.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.421
{\an5}You're going to
apologize for...

18:49.586 --> 18:51.421
(shouts)

18:51.505 --> 18:52.548
(gasping)

18:52.631 --> 18:53.715
You fucking hear me?!

18:53.799 --> 18:56.844
I told you to stop
fucking with me!

18:56.927 --> 19:00.389
(groaning)

19:04.810 --> 19:06.812
(both grunting)

19:09.106 --> 19:10.357
{\an3}WOMAN:
Call the cops!

19:10.440 --> 19:11.400
Move it, bitch.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.777
{\an4}MAN:
Hey, guys,
break it up, come on.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.904
(grunting)

19:29.668 --> 19:31.587
{\an3}Hey, aren't you
that girl from work?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.046
{\an5}Um...

19:31.670 --> 19:33.046
It's me, Perry.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.965
Yeah.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.259
Real fucking polite.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.552
{\an5}(car alarm chirps)

19:37.342 --> 19:38.552
Come on, let's go.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.928
Oh, you think
you're so hot?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.305
Fucking bitch.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.390
Stop ignoring me,
you fucking bitch!

19:53.400 --> 19:54.401
{\an3}I mean, has everyone
lost their minds?

19:54.484 --> 19:57.279
Everyone back there
just had too much to drink.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.488
That's-that's all it--

19:58.572 --> 20:00.616
{\an1}The guys definitely had too much
to drink. I mean, the girls--

20:00.699 --> 20:02.159
not you, of course--
but the rest of us,

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
{\an1}we had too much
to drink...

20:03.410 --> 20:04.620
{\an5}Is that guy following us?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.620
{\an1}What?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.082
No. I don't, I don't think so.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.459
{\an3}No, no. That-that's
a motorcycle.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.501
{\an3}That guy Perry
had a motorcycle.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.672
{\an1}A-All right, take, take a right.
Take a right here.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.882
(tires screech)

20:16.965 --> 20:18.717
(panting)

20:18.800 --> 20:20.969
Uh... Uh, he's still there.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.056
{\an1}Yeah.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.476
Uh, take, uh, take a left.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.894
(tires screech)

20:31.396 --> 20:32.314
{\an1}Shit.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.107
<i>Okay,</i>

20:34.191 --> 20:35.984
take a, uh, take a,
take another left.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.819
(tires screeching)

20:37.903 --> 20:38.987
Okay. Go. Go.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.450
I don't see him.
Is he still there?

20:43.533 --> 20:46.954
No. No, he's gone. Thank God.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.080
Martha, something is happening.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.832
{\an3}That fight, t-those guys,
a-and then Dylan last night,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.876
{\an5}I mean, I-I don't know.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.876
Wait. What?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
{\an5}This can't be a coincidence.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
Something happened with Dylan?

20:54.753 --> 20:55.796
{\an3}It was, it was like
those people at the bar.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.422
Dylan attacked you?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.970
I don't know. No, he...

21:04.388 --> 21:06.306
I guess

21:06.390 --> 21:09.810
{\an3}I gave him a,
a confusing vibe.

21:09.893 --> 21:13.271
We were making out and then he,
he just got fucking nuts.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.400
MARTHA:
<i>Annie, why didn't you tell me?</i>

21:16.483 --> 21:17.901
{\an1}Shit.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.361
<i>Fucking piece of shit.</i>

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
Annie.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.491
I did. I-I tried.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.867
(exhales)

21:25.951 --> 21:28.370
I tried, in that, just, I...

21:28.453 --> 21:31.373
{\an3}um...

21:31.456 --> 21:35.168
I just didn't say anything.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.129
I'm still processing
what happened.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.214
Okay.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.509
I get it.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.554
You do?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.931
I mean, yeah. I mean,
before Mike, I've...

21:48.015 --> 21:51.226
been on a million shitty dates,
just like everybody, right?

21:51.309 --> 21:53.687
{\an1}And a few of them
were...

21:55.772 --> 21:58.608
...a little more than shitty.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.153
So, yeah... But...

22:01.236 --> 22:04.114
you don't always have to handle

22:04.197 --> 22:07.242
{\an1}everything on your own
all the time, Annie.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.788
Thanks.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.915
(laughs softly)

22:13.999 --> 22:15.208
(clicking)

22:16.334 --> 22:20.922
I know this sounds
ridiculous, but...

22:21.006 --> 22:25.093
I think it's the meteors.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.762
{\an5}Wait, what?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.762
That's stupid.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.430
Out loud, that sounds stupid.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.599
Even in your head, that sounds
stupid. What are you s--

22:30.682 --> 22:32.601
The meteorites?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.728
It's not like everyone in town
touched one.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.980
Dylan had one. The guy at
the bar took a shot with one.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.274
{\an5}I... Shit.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.274
(engine approaches)

22:39.357 --> 22:41.443
{\an6}Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.443
Shit. Shit, shit.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.944
Shit. Come on!

22:43.028 --> 22:44.404
MARTHA:
<i>Come on.</i>

22:44.488 --> 22:47.282
{\an1}Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go!

22:48.533 --> 22:50.452
{\an1}Go, go, go, go, go.
I got my keys.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.536
I got my keys, go.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.375
{\an5}(panting)
Oh, my God!

22:55.373 --> 22:57.375
Hey, are you okay?

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
{\an5}Oh, my God. Um...

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
{\an3}What's up?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.129
{\an5}We should call the police.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.129
{\an1}MARTHA:
And there's a-- there's...

23:01.213 --> 23:03.090
{\an5}The police? Why? What happened?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.090
{\an1}There's a man...
(stammers)

23:03.173 --> 23:05.467
{\an1}A-A man followed us
and he is out there right now.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.260
Wait, a man followed you
and he's here.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.512
{\an3}Yes.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.555
{\an5}(engine revving)

23:08.595 --> 23:10.555
{\an3}(quietly:
Oh, my God.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.768
{\an5}I'll handle it.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.768
(lock clicks)

23:14.851 --> 23:16.269
No, hon, I don't think
that's a good idea...

23:16.353 --> 23:17.479
I said I will handle it!

23:34.788 --> 23:35.997
Annie, can you see anything?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.999
{\an5}(indistinct conversation)

23:36.081 --> 23:37.999
MAN: Hey!

23:41.753 --> 23:43.004
Call 911.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.172
Wha...

23:44.256 --> 23:46.216
Call 911!

23:44.256 --> 23:46.216
{\an3}Okay.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.011
(men grunting)

23:50.095 --> 23:52.139
(thudding)

23:58.770 --> 24:00.689
It's a busy signal.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.898
(crunch, man yells)

24:01.982 --> 24:03.316
(silence)

24:03.400 --> 24:05.527
What was that?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.904
(footsteps approaching)

24:07.988 --> 24:10.031
Annie?

24:11.992 --> 24:14.369
Annie. Annie, w-what?

24:14.452 --> 24:16.538
(lock clicks)

24:16.621 --> 24:17.998
Martha?

24:18.081 --> 24:19.666
We have to leave now.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.168
{\an5}Out the back. Quick.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.168
Wait, what?

24:21.251 --> 24:22.919
What are you talking about?
Mike is out there.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.046
{\an5}We can't leave him.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.046
Martha!

24:25.130 --> 24:27.382
Mike is sick.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.884
What?

24:27.465 --> 24:28.884
It's not just him.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.927
{\an3}He has the same signs
as a lot of people.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.096
Since the meteors.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.687
And it's just the men.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.355
{\an5}MIKE: Martha!

24:40.770 --> 24:42.355
(pounding on door)

24:42.439 --> 24:43.523
(raps on door)

24:43.607 --> 24:44.774
Martha, open up.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.026
{\an4}MARTHA:
Okay...

24:44.858 --> 24:46.026
(pounding)

24:46.109 --> 24:47.319
Martha!

24:47.402 --> 24:48.570
Oh, God.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.571
Annie, listen to me.
Listen to me.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.573
{\an1}I need you to calm down.
Mike doesn't have it.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.158
{\an5}We have to let him in.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.158
{\an3}Martha, no.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.910
{\an3}Mike does not
have it, Annie.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.162
{\an5}Martha, no!

24:54.993 --> 24:57.162
This is Mike
we're talking about!

25:07.172 --> 25:09.841
(lock clicks)

25:12.344 --> 25:15.680
{\an1}MIKE: Baby.
You should've seen me. (laughs)

25:25.857 --> 25:28.485
{\an1}(exhales)

25:30.028 --> 25:32.364
{\an5}(Mike whoops)

25:30.028 --> 25:32.364
{\an3}Mike?

25:32.447 --> 25:34.991
(water running)

25:35.075 --> 25:36.660
{\an1}H-Honey?

25:36.743 --> 25:38.787
(Mike exhales)

25:38.870 --> 25:43.708
{\an1}MIKE: Oh, it felt good
letting that guy have it.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.962
Yeah?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.962
{\an1}Yeah.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.257
{\an1}MIKE:
It felt real good.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.437
{\an1}Ah...

26:07.732 --> 26:09.651
We forgot your birthday cake.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.821
{\an1}All right.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.992
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

26:17.075 --> 26:19.869
♪ Happy birthday ♪

26:19.953 --> 26:22.998

26:35.969 --> 26:37.345
{\an1}Honey,

26:37.429 --> 26:38.805
blow out the candles.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.682
But don't forget to make a wish.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.934
(trembling gasp)

26:43.018 --> 26:46.354
Do it! Please.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.565
I-I don't,
I don't want to, Mike.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.567
Do it!

26:55.155 --> 26:57.699
(sharp exhale)

26:57.782 --> 26:59.826
{\an1}Oh, you got
to come closer.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.677
Yay!

27:17.761 --> 27:21.931
Hey, maybe we should wait
until Cole gets home.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.558
{\an5}Cole...

27:22.015 --> 27:23.558
{\an3}Huh, Mike?

27:23.641 --> 27:26.061
{\an3}Just, uh, put it down,
and-and wait...

27:26.144 --> 27:27.687
You know...

27:27.771 --> 27:30.357
(laughs)
I just saved you two

27:30.440 --> 27:31.733
from a fucking psychopath.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.903
{\an1}How about
a little thank you?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.488
Okay, Mike, you-you-you,
you don't have to yell.

27:36.571 --> 27:39.616
I'm not yelling!

27:41.659 --> 27:44.079
{\an1}You know,
maybe next time,

27:44.162 --> 27:47.248
you don't lead
a lunatic to my house.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.377
Two girls drinking
at a fucking bar?

27:50.460 --> 27:52.003
You're asking for it.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.131
{\an5}A-Asking for it?

27:52.087 --> 27:55.131
Don't interrupt me!

27:55.215 --> 27:57.801
I am done with you
interrupting me!

27:57.884 --> 28:00.136
Every time I have
a fucking story,

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
you got to open
that mouth of yours!

28:02.305 --> 28:05.767
{\an1}I'm trying
to keep you safe!

28:05.850 --> 28:10.480
{\an3}Uh... Mike?

28:10.563 --> 28:14.567
{\an3}Hey, uh, I need you
to listen to me.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.946
I have to explain something
about you.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.948
Is this what you wanted?

28:20.031 --> 28:22.117
Did you want him
to follow you home?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.785
{\an5}Of course not.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.785
Shut up, Annie!

28:23.868 --> 28:25.453
I'm talking to my wife!

28:25.537 --> 28:26.788
{\an5}(screams)

28:25.537 --> 28:26.788
(glass shatters)

28:26.871 --> 28:28.164
Wait, Mike! What happened? Mike!

28:28.248 --> 28:30.250
{\an3}Mike! Mike!

28:30.333 --> 28:32.335
Stop it! No...

28:34.712 --> 28:36.714
(grunts)

28:42.887 --> 28:45.598
(panting)

28:45.682 --> 28:49.269
Uh, Martha?

28:49.352 --> 28:50.854
{\an5}(whispering):
We need to leave.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.854
{\an3}(moaning)

28:50.937 --> 28:53.773
{\an5}We need to leave right now.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.773
{\an3}C-Cole.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.609
{\an4}We-- we've-- we have
to get Cole. He went out.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.609
{\an3}Uh...

28:56.693 --> 28:58.528
He's with Steve at the docks.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.613
{\an5}We have to go.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.613
{\an3}Okay.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.202
(gasps)

29:06.286 --> 29:07.454
What?! Oh...

29:07.537 --> 29:08.663
Oh, oh, God.

29:08.746 --> 29:10.665
(Martha moaning)

29:10.748 --> 29:12.667
(engine starts)

29:14.419 --> 29:16.379
MARTHA:
<i>C-Cole didn't touch a meteor.</i>

29:16.463 --> 29:17.964
A-Annie, he'll be safe, right?

29:18.047 --> 29:19.841
{\an5}I'm sure he's okay,
I'm sure he's okay.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.841
You promise?

29:19.924 --> 29:22.844
(tires screeching)

29:22.927 --> 29:25.763
(moaning, grunting)

29:25.847 --> 29:27.265
{\an5}(siren wailing)

29:25.847 --> 29:27.265
{\an1}Annie?

29:27.348 --> 29:29.142
{\an1}I'm okay.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.685
{\an1}Fuck...
(clears throat)

29:30.768 --> 29:35.023
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.317
{\an1}Ow...

29:37.400 --> 29:40.069
{\an1}Oh...

29:40.153 --> 29:42.530
Annie? What are you...?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.365
Oh, God.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.451
(panting)

29:50.580 --> 29:52.499
(dog barking in distance)

29:52.582 --> 29:54.667
(helicopter whirring)

29:54.751 --> 29:57.170
Oh, my God.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.716
{\an1}(gasps)

30:01.799 --> 30:03.343
Annie...

30:03.426 --> 30:05.428
(footsteps approaching)

30:09.807 --> 30:12.519
(panting)

30:12.602 --> 30:14.187
Oh, my God.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.070
We have to go.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.822
{\an1}We have...
We have to get Cole.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.076
We gotta get Cole.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.661
MAN (in distance):
Let's kill 'em all!

30:35.500 --> 30:39.420
Uh, the docks should just be...
a few blocks that way.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.464
(both scream)

30:41.548 --> 30:43.216
Crazy night, huh?

30:44.634 --> 30:45.718
(grunting)

30:49.514 --> 30:50.557
(screams)

30:50.640 --> 30:52.684
(shouting)

30:58.189 --> 30:59.107
{\an3}Hey, Annie!

30:59.190 --> 31:01.150
{\an5}Don't you remember me?

30:59.190 --> 31:01.150
{\an1}(screams)

31:09.200 --> 31:10.618
(screams)

31:18.042 --> 31:19.961
Get him out!

31:20.044 --> 31:21.462
Get the fuck out of the car!

31:21.546 --> 31:24.132
(grunting and shouting)

31:27.719 --> 31:30.430
{\an5}PHIL:
Annie! Wait! Please!

31:27.719 --> 31:30.430
{\an3}Is it Phil?

31:30.513 --> 31:32.807
Annie! Listen to me.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.642
I don't have it. Okay?

31:34.726 --> 31:37.145
It's not all us men, okay?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.396
It can't be all of us.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.148
{\an3}It did seem likely to me
that it's probably

31:40.231 --> 31:42.358
a, uh, hormonal reaction,

31:42.442 --> 31:44.485
{\an3}but that would mean that-that
it's also highly likely

31:44.569 --> 31:46.696
that it's a chromosomal
interaction with the Y...

31:46.779 --> 31:47.822
{\an6}(voice distorts):
chromosome...

31:46.779 --> 31:47.822
Hold up!

31:47.905 --> 31:49.198
Hey, look, it's unlikely

31:49.282 --> 31:51.451
that the mineral itself
is the culprit here!

31:51.534 --> 31:52.493
{\an3}I'm sorry!

31:52.577 --> 31:55.330
(growling)

31:55.413 --> 31:57.290
(both screaming)

32:02.378 --> 32:05.214
{\an3}Oh...
Come on, come on.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.508
{\an3}Oh... oh...
oh, my God.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.801
What is happening?

32:08.885 --> 32:12.680
{\an1}This is, this is crazy!
(exhales)

32:12.764 --> 32:15.725
{\an3}Annie, we have
to do something.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.685
{\an3}Um...

32:24.567 --> 32:26.027
What are you doing?

32:26.110 --> 32:30.365
{\an3}These... these things
are making them stronger.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.658
{\an3}We...

32:31.741 --> 32:33.534
we have to try.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.662
{\an3}Okay?

32:35.745 --> 32:36.913
We have to fight back.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.846
{\an3}Aw, fuck!

32:53.930 --> 32:55.014
It's not doing anything!

32:55.098 --> 32:58.476
Martha... Martha, you know why.

33:01.270 --> 33:04.065
It's just the men.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.568
{\an5}Get off my property!

33:05.775 --> 33:07.568
(both scream)

33:15.410 --> 33:17.203
What the fuck?

33:17.286 --> 33:19.747
(opera music playing)

33:19.831 --> 33:21.666
(shouting)

33:30.758 --> 33:32.385
Fuck you, Chad!

33:32.468 --> 33:34.762
Fuck you, Becky!

33:34.846 --> 33:38.057
Fuck your feelings! (screams)

33:40.810 --> 33:44.021
(opera music continues playing)

33:50.278 --> 33:53.990
(grunting)

33:54.073 --> 33:58.202
{\an5}Amazing, right? (chuckles)

33:54.073 --> 33:58.202
Um, mm-hmm.

34:00.329 --> 34:01.372
Whew.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.337
{\an3}Ooh!

34:08.420 --> 34:10.172
(laughs) Come on.

34:10.255 --> 34:11.299
I'm telling you, baby.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.969
{\an3}It changes you.
Makes you stronger.

34:16.053 --> 34:18.473
Um... no, I'm-I'm...

34:18.556 --> 34:20.641
{\an1}I actually don't really
want to drink that.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.641
{\an3}Why not?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.728
{\an3}Come on.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.610
{\an5}What's wrong?

34:28.608 --> 34:31.610
Um... nothing.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.987
{\an1}I'm just...
not in the mood.

34:33.070 --> 34:36.282
Come on.
Don't be such a prude.

34:39.076 --> 34:41.286
{\an1}Hey.

34:39.076 --> 34:41.286
What's your problem?

34:41.370 --> 34:42.538
{\an1}I, uh...

34:41.370 --> 34:42.538
You're okay?

34:42.621 --> 34:44.540
Yeah, I... I am,

34:44.623 --> 34:46.417
{\an1}I just don't want to do this
right now, okay?

34:50.087 --> 34:51.839
S-Steve...

34:51.922 --> 34:54.967
{\an1}S-Steve?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.427
Hey.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.180
{\an3}They're on a boat
called the <i> Achilles.</i>

34:59.263 --> 35:01.599
{\an5}How do you know that?

34:59.263 --> 35:01.599
Ah, don't ask.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.519
{\an3}MARTHA:
Cole, please.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.521
{\an5}(Steve grunting)

35:04.602 --> 35:06.521
{\an3}Cole?

35:06.604 --> 35:08.314
(grunting)
Come on!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.401
{\an3}Cole? Cole!
Cole! Honey...

35:12.485 --> 35:14.320
{\an4}STEVE:
Come on!

35:12.485 --> 35:14.320
Are you okay?

35:14.403 --> 35:16.364
{\an6}Look at me.
Are you okay?

35:14.403 --> 35:16.364
Yeah, just... it-it was...

35:16.447 --> 35:19.033
{\an6}(grunting)

35:16.447 --> 35:19.033
{\an1}Steve, he just, he just
went crazy. I don't--

35:19.116 --> 35:21.285
{\an5}I don't know what I did...

35:19.116 --> 35:21.285
{\an3}You didn't do anything, honey,
it's not your fault.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.912
{\an3}It's-- It's
the meteorites.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.706
(panting)
I swear he's a good guy.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.042
He was just obsessed
with that stupid fucking rock.

{\an3}Hey!

38:01.904 --> 38:03.906
(indistinct radio chatter)

38:06.367 --> 38:08.202
No organic compounds
in this one.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.664
{\an5}No parasites. No bacteria.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.664
Then it must be chemical.

38:11.747 --> 38:12.999
{\an3}The meteors.
The water.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.418
{\an3}It's the only commonality
amongst these men.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.502
Something caused this.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.713
Hi.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.713
{\an1}I, uh--

38:18.796 --> 38:20.172
They took my blood.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.258
{\an3}Yeah.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.258
I'm cool, I guess.

in my back pocket

38:26.929 --> 38:28.681
the whole night, so...

38:28.764 --> 38:30.891
What? But Cole, Steve was near
that, and it happened to him.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.602
{\an1}Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.938
It's not all of us.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.523
Maybe there is no cure.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.191
She's right.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.068
Honey, don't say that.
Dad's gonna be fine.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.903
They're not gonna find anything.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.447
Because there's no disease.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.948
The meteors, they...

38:46.032 --> 38:47.783
{\an5}they were a placebo.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.783
There's no cure because

38:47.867 --> 38:49.618
it'll always be inside me.

38:49.702 --> 38:50.786
What?

38:50.870 --> 38:52.038
I...

38:52.121 --> 38:53.748
{\an3}ANNIE: You stopped
yourself from turning.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.541
I saw you.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.585
That's the thing.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.422
I chose to.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.965
I just chose to.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.477
{\an5}IDs, please.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.477
Oh, um...

39:14.560 --> 39:16.145
{\an1}Okay.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.738
You know, I bet you'd look
much cuter if you smiled.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.073
What did you say?

try it sometime?

No.

{\an5}NEWS ANCHOR:
When we come back,
a mass shooting

39:42.254 --> 39:43.756
claims the lives of 13.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.257
{\an5}The suspect
was a man in his 20s

39:45.341 --> 39:47.468
with no motive yet known.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.137
{\an5}And two men are in custody
after a road rage incident.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.639
More after this.

39:53.766 --> 39:56.811
{\an3}Tonight, Annie Miller found
herself in the center

39:56.894 --> 39:59.647
of a mysterious
and violent epidemic.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.941
What she encountered
was no material disease,

40:02.024 --> 40:04.485
but rather a plague
of conscience.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.154
One that gave men
permission to ignore decency,

40:07.238 --> 40:08.781
consent and fear.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.033
And tonight, all it took

40:11.117 --> 40:16.622
was a few innocuous little rocks
to turn men into monsters.

40:16.705 --> 40:20.417
Here... in The Twilight Zone.
