00:56.969 --> 00:59.363
- That is correct, Molly.
- Ha! Knew it!

00:59.450 --> 01:01.104
For months, I've been
studying Hebrew,

01:01.191 --> 01:03.585
practicing my Torah portion,
and trying on dresses

01:03.672 --> 01:04.934

OK, how was I?
Did I look too nervous?

02:49.386 --> 02:51.083
- Did I look like a woman?
- Oh, yeah!

02:51.171 --> 02:52.694
You rocked
that Torah portion.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.783
I didn't understand any of it,
to be honest,

02:54.870 --> 02:56.176
but you were great!

02:56.263 --> 02:58.439
So, when's everyone else
coming here?

That's Uncle Ted and Aunt Meg

and their sons,
Joshua and Gordie.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.413

03:24.639 --> 03:25.944
Wow, you, uh...

03:26.031 --> 03:27.511
really went all-in
on the turtles.

03:27.598 --> 03:30.471
Yeah, that's my theme.
Oh, I envy turtles.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.473
They can curl their soft,
vulnerable bodies

03:32.560 --> 03:34.170
into their hard shells,
where none of life's

03:34.257 --> 03:36.172
sharp edges can harm them.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.130
What a life.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.698
But-But-But Libby!
This is your special day!

03:40.785 --> 03:44.572
You deserve a fountain,
a DJ, and a celebrity chef!

03:44.659 --> 03:47.401
Oh, Molly, I mean, sure,
all that stuff might be nice,

03:47.488 --> 03:49.272
but I'm just happy
you're here!

03:49.359 --> 03:52.188
Oh! I need to prep the turtles
for the turtle races!

03:52.275 --> 03:53.711
But after that, you and me,

03:53.798 --> 03:56.540
we are going to party
into the night!

03:56.627 --> 03:58.238
I mean, this party
is deader than I am,

03:58.325 --> 04:00.109
- and I'm dead!

04:00.196 --> 04:01.763
We're scraping by.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.852
But books just aren't selling
like they used to.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.941
We live
in a digital age.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.813
Yep. E-books
are e-killing us.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.424
Did you hear that, Scratch?

04:10.511 --> 04:13.078
I only listen when I
hear my name, so... no.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.167
Libby's Mom's bookstore
is struggling!

04:15.255 --> 04:17.735
That's why Libby didn't go big
on her big day!

04:17.822 --> 04:20.782
She's settling
and sacrificing and making do!

04:20.869 --> 04:23.959
Well, I'm making don't!
Libby is a shining star,

04:24.046 --> 04:26.570

the bat mitzvah she deserves!

Hundred percent

04:28.050 --> 04:29.486
All right, how many
bats you want?

04:29.573 --> 04:30.879
Two hundred, four hundred?
You know what?

04:30.966 --> 04:32.402
You're right.
It's Libby's big day.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.578
- One thou--!
- Scratch! No bats!

04:35.666 --> 04:36.754

I'm starting to feel

06:59.288 --> 07:00.942

07:01.029 --> 07:04.119
Libby, I'm your best friend.
If you need me, I'm here.

07:04.206 --> 07:07.078
I won't leave your side,

Scratch, this is
a big night for Libby,

07:32.147 --> 07:33.888

your bats ruining it!

07:33.975 --> 07:35.803
It's already ruined!

07:35.890 --> 07:39.807
She's invited turtles up
to light candles!

07:41.330 --> 07:43.593
Well, turtles are
what Libby wanted, OK?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.290
Well, Libby can have
sad turtles

07:45.377 --> 07:47.989
or friends at her party,
but she can't have both.

07:48.076 --> 07:51.514
Follow me, Fawn-dreas, there's
a <i>quinceañera</i> down the street.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.603
Oh, no! We've gotta
get them to stay!

07:53.690 --> 07:55.344
Think, Molly,
think, Molly, think!

07:55.431 --> 07:58.100
What is one thing
no middle schooler can resist?

07:59.087 --> 08:01.437
- Slow dancing!
- Room full o' bats!

08:04.179 --> 08:06.747
Aw, yeah. We're gonna
bring it down a notch.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.663
- Time for a smooth jazz
slow dance.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.362
- Must dance.
- Slow dance.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.233
- Dance.
- Must dance.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.279
- Must find partner and dance.
- You wanna dance?

08:17.366 --> 08:19.411
Wanna dance?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.630
Dance...

08:24.852 --> 08:26.854
This party is back on track.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.117
May I have this dance, m'lady?

08:29.204 --> 08:31.075
I don't know what you expect
to happen here, my dude.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.516
Sorry, Teddy Bear.
Out of order.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.823
Ooh! But I had four shells
of turtle punch!

08:39.910 --> 08:42.173
- Scratch, I am out there
trying to create

08:42.260 --> 08:43.914
a wonderful memory
that Libby will cherish

08:44.001 --> 08:45.394
in her heart forever,
and you are ruining it!

08:45.481 --> 08:47.744
I'm just trying
to liven things up!

08:47.831 --> 08:50.486
Look around, even Libby's
not enjoying this party.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.488
- Oh, uh...

08:52.575 --> 08:54.185
Don't worry, I'm on it!

08:54.272 --> 08:57.362
Hey! Who's ready for the hora!

08:57.449 --> 08:59.060
Um... Heights
and being tossed around

08:59.147 --> 09:00.801
are two of
my biggest anxieties.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.367
Can't we just do
the turtle races?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.108
Oh! Of course we can!

09:04.195 --> 09:06.023
- Right after the hora!

09:06.110 --> 09:08.373
<i>It's the moment you've all
been waiting for,</i>

09:08.460 --> 09:09.897
<i>that age-old tradition,</i>

09:09.984 --> 09:11.812
<i>the hora!</i>

09:11.899 --> 09:14.336
<i>Give it up for
the woman of the hour,</i>

09:14.423 --> 09:18.035
<i>Libby Stein-Torres!</i>

09:19.907 --> 09:22.736
<i>She's probably
just being shy.</i>

09:22.823 --> 09:24.041
Just one moment.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.175
Libby, what are you
doin' back here?

09:27.262 --> 09:28.872
You're missin'
your special day.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.396
Molly, you keep saying
it's <i>my</i> special day,

09:31.483 --> 09:34.182
but it doesn't feel like <i>
my</i> day at all!

09:34.269 --> 09:37.577
I didn't <i>want</i> a big party,
I didn't <i>want</i> all these people.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.362
You've turned this party
into what <i>you</i> thought I wanted!

09:40.449 --> 09:43.800
Oh. So, what was it
that you wanted?

09:43.887 --> 09:46.237
To spend time with <i>you!</i>

09:47.761 --> 09:49.589
Uh, sorry, it's the hormones.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.591
But the feelings are accurate.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.768
It finally happened.
I'm a woman!

09:54.855 --> 09:57.466
You know, I feel different.
Do I look taller to you?

09:57.553 --> 09:59.990
I'm sorry, Libby,
but I'm gonna fix this.

10:00.077 --> 10:03.298
Then I promise I am yours
for the rest of the night.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.609
I'm not even
touching the door!

10:12.307 --> 10:14.135
- Yes!

10:14.222 --> 10:16.311
- Bats!

10:20.315 --> 10:22.665
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:22.752 --> 10:25.799
Give me the jazz!

10:25.886 --> 10:28.715
Now, <i>that's</i> a bat mitzvah!

10:28.802 --> 10:31.413
Oh! Oh, they're
turning on me! Ow!

10:33.720 --> 10:34.982
Ooh, you ungrateful bats!

10:35.069 --> 10:37.419
After all I did for you!

10:37.506 --> 10:39.508
Go, Simon!
Go, Shelly!

10:39.595 --> 10:41.336
You can do it!
Shelly!
You can do this!

10:41.423 --> 10:42.859
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Shelly, come on!

10:42.946 --> 10:44.295
- You gotta believe!
- Yeah! Yeah, go, go!

10:44.382 --> 10:46.689
Come on, Simon,
close the deal, baby!

10:46.776 --> 10:50.301
Come on,
faster, faster!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.100
- Yes!

10:53.087 --> 10:55.785
Now, <i>this</i> is
the perfect party.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.179
Sorry I almost ruined
your special day, Libby.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.355
Oh, it's OK, Molly.
I've learned a lot

11:00.442 --> 11:02.313
in the minutes
since I became a woman.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.273
Like, how we're all responsible
for our own happiness.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.362
It felt good to stand up
for what I wanted today.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.451
Wow. You're so wise!

11:09.538 --> 11:11.322
Wonder when I'll
become a woman.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.847
Enjoy what's left
of your childhood, Molly.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.849
It'll be over
before ya know it.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.155
Aah! It's way more of 'em
than we ordered!
