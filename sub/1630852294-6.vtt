09:31.900 --> 09:34.280
And there's no way
he's picking up that ball.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.570
Alice: Betsy!
Betsy, we missed you!

09:36.650 --> 09:39.410
You know you can have alone
time whenever you want.

09:39.490 --> 09:40.450
What?
Yeah.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.910
Like,
if you need to peel off,

09:41.990 --> 09:44.200
do your own thing,
it's cool with the coven.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.080
Sorry we didn't lead
with that.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.040
Okay.
Thanks.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.630
How did you guys know
I was worried about that?

09:51.710 --> 09:54.460
We astral projected and watched
the entire progression

09:54.550 --> 09:57.970
of your adorable relationship
with that ghost boy.

09:58.050 --> 10:00.090
You know about
Ghost the Boy?

10:00.180 --> 10:02.850
-Yeah, so where is he?
-We wanted to meet him.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.470
I don't know actually.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.390
He should have been
back by now.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.940
Oh, boy, night-three
homesickness, right on time.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.150
Come here, you.

10:15.230 --> 10:16.990
It -- It's not that.

10:17.070 --> 10:20.160
Do you have an island
directory or something?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.030
I can't find someone.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.240
Gotta be more specific.

10:24.330 --> 10:26.370
He's super handsome.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.710
Average float.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.830
As emotionally transparent

10:29.920 --> 10:32.460
as he is
physically transparent.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.840
What?

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
I haven't met many ghosts,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.470
but I know
this one was special.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.180
Really special.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.550
I mean, you should have
met his dads.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.180
It runs in the family.

10:43.260 --> 10:47.350
Would you say they're
the best dads of all time?

10:47.430 --> 10:49.730
I mean, yeah.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.060
But, well, join the club.
Everyone's got problems here.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.400
You shouldn't date
ghosts anyways.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.440
They're dead inside...
and outside.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.190
Okay, good night.
