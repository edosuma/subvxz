00:01.380 --> 00:06.799
♪ Yeah, yeah

00:06.903 --> 00:12.702
♪ Whoa

00:12.805 --> 00:15.705
Reporter: Obviously a very tough
day for the Southern Jets,

00:15.808 --> 00:18.225
with a public memorial
for young Jack Davies

00:18.328 --> 00:19.778
earlier this morning,

00:19.881 --> 00:22.436
unprecedented numbers
turning out,

00:22.539 --> 00:24.921
many remaining at the ground
as friends and family

00:25.025 --> 00:27.958
made their way out
to a private gathering.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.960
Brian: And how do you think
they're holding up?

00:30.064 --> 00:32.998
Some of them are struggling.
More than I expected.

00:33.102 --> 00:35.276
Did you clock Rusty
falling asleep at one point?

00:35.380 --> 00:37.002
He might have been
saying a prayer.

00:41.248 --> 00:44.975
Paige!I'm so sorry about Jack.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.254
Oh...

00:53.122 --> 00:56.504
Sorry. Um...
I'm on autopilot.

00:56.608 --> 00:58.575
I've been hugging people
for days -- was that weird?

00:58.679 --> 01:02.165
Only in the nicest possible way.

01:02.269 --> 01:04.305
Hey, I know it's completely
different,

01:04.409 --> 01:06.687
but when my nan passed away,

01:06.790 --> 01:09.793
the hardest thing
was other people's grief.

01:09.897 --> 01:12.313
They all mean well,
but it's exhausting,

01:12.417 --> 01:16.041
smiling politely,
receiving condolences,

01:16.145 --> 01:18.285
wishing you could tell them
all to just fuck off.

01:18.388 --> 01:21.943
In the nicest possible way.

01:22.047 --> 01:23.911
I still don't...

01:24.014 --> 01:27.673
understand what happened.

01:27.777 --> 01:30.124
That must make it
so much harder.

01:30.228 --> 01:32.644
I'm trying to make peace
with the fact

01:32.747 --> 01:34.611
that it might never make sense.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.892
I should let you get back to it.

01:39.996 --> 01:41.446
Thank you for coming.

01:45.346 --> 01:46.554
Hey, Trav.

01:46.658 --> 01:48.038
Hey.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.144
Your tribute was
really beautiful.

01:50.248 --> 01:51.732
Thanks, Kath.

01:51.835 --> 01:53.389
Maddy wrote it.

01:53.492 --> 01:55.218
Well, there was a lot
of you in there.

01:55.322 --> 01:57.047
No.
She wrote the whole thing.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.016
But you read it beautifully.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.604
Ah...
Well...

02:01.707 --> 02:03.709
I think you helped
a lot of people.

02:03.813 --> 02:05.332
Especially the younger boys.

02:05.435 --> 02:08.818
They need you now
more than ever.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.475
We all do.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.375
Yeah.

02:14.479 --> 02:16.066
Thanks.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.312
Thanks.

02:21.831 --> 02:24.730
This could not be
less appropriate,

02:24.834 --> 02:26.076
but you look incredible.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.770
It is appropriate.
And thank you.

02:29.873 --> 02:31.599
Today that dress makes sense.

02:31.703 --> 02:33.705
It didn't make sense
all the other times?

02:33.808 --> 02:36.673
It does today.

02:36.777 --> 02:39.676
Oh, Tahlia, I just wanted
to let you know

02:39.780 --> 02:43.646
that I won't be posting
anything today, out of respect.

02:50.342 --> 02:52.137
Thank you.

02:52.241 --> 02:53.725
Avoid the salmon dip.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.869
Dan tells me Jack and Trav
were really close.

02:59.972 --> 03:03.873
Mmm. He's just trying to figure
out where to put it all,

03:03.976 --> 03:07.394
just burying himself
in distraction sex.

03:07.497 --> 03:10.017
I haven't been around enough.

03:10.120 --> 03:14.090
This new role is a bit of...
bit of an adjustment.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.473
This isn't the right time
to ask...

03:17.576 --> 03:19.095
Say it quietly.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.718
Is distraction sex
the same as, um, edging?

03:21.822 --> 03:23.513
No, not the same.

03:23.617 --> 03:25.239
It's a little pre-game ritual.

03:29.174 --> 03:32.246
Some of the boys refrain
from finishing in the bedroom

03:32.350 --> 03:34.662
a day or two before a game.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.216
They think it gives them
an edge.

03:36.319 --> 03:37.976
Hence the name.

03:38.079 --> 03:40.116
Um, does it work?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.462
Trav swears by it.

03:52.162 --> 03:53.854
Brian: Yeah.
Excuse me.

03:57.892 --> 03:58.997
You've had enough, hey?

03:59.100 --> 04:01.206
Come on, it's just one day,

04:01.310 --> 04:03.588
one unimaginably
heartbreaking day.

04:03.691 --> 04:05.383
So you didn't sleep
through all the eulogies...

04:05.486 --> 04:07.799
I mean, you said we're all
just people today, right?

04:07.902 --> 04:10.215
People in a lot of pain?Yeah, now's not the time.

04:10.319 --> 04:11.596
You think Jack's family,

04:11.699 --> 04:13.011
Jessie need to deal
with you going to shit?

04:13.114 --> 04:15.289
Why do we listen to you?Hey?

04:15.393 --> 04:17.705
Is everything okay?Yeah, yeah.

04:17.809 --> 04:19.569
Russ is about to go home.

04:19.673 --> 04:21.364
Are you hungry?
Hey, We'll get you a doggie bag.

04:21.468 --> 04:22.779
Hmm?
Load you up with some food

04:22.883 --> 04:24.333
so you don't have to worry
about it later.

04:24.436 --> 04:27.232
Nah, I'm no hungry.Okay, well, now I'm not asking.

04:27.336 --> 04:30.062
Get in a cab before you make
a mess of yourself.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.379
Child: I want some magic.

04:36.483 --> 04:39.002
J.J.! Hey, buddy.
Come here.

04:39.106 --> 04:42.074
Come here. Come on.
Hey, buddy.

04:42.178 --> 04:45.008
How are you going?
Huh?

04:45.112 --> 04:47.252
You wanna see some magic.Yeah, magic.

04:47.356 --> 04:49.634
Yeah, yeah? All right.
Ready?

04:49.737 --> 04:51.360
Watch it.

04:59.851 --> 05:02.232
-How's Jessie coping?
-She's not, mate.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.649
How has this affected your prep
going into round one?

05:04.752 --> 05:06.340
You're an arsehole, Neil.I'm sorry.

05:06.444 --> 05:08.963
This just isn't a good time,
guys. Thanks.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.586
Was he wearing a life jacket
at the time of the accident?

05:10.689 --> 05:12.242
Don't listen to him.
Come inside.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.830
Jessie's just buried
her husband,

05:13.934 --> 05:15.384
and her two-year-old kid

05:15.487 --> 05:16.833
is not going to have
one memory of his dad!

05:16.937 --> 05:19.249
Brian.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.872
Have a bit of respect.

05:27.465 --> 05:29.467
Brian!That prick...

05:29.570 --> 05:31.572
Questions are going to be coming
from much brighter minds

05:31.676 --> 05:33.678
at the inquest.
We'll get through this.

05:33.781 --> 05:36.094
But you have got to
pull your head in.

05:36.197 --> 05:37.923
You can not afford to let your
emotions drive you, okay?

05:38.027 --> 05:39.373
Especially not in front
of the players.

05:39.477 --> 05:42.721
They don't know anything
I don't want them to.

05:42.825 --> 05:46.863
You think you were hiding your
anger in front of Rusty today?

05:46.967 --> 05:50.142
Those players know a hell of a
lot more than you think they do.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.009
I'm going to crack
the good whisky.

05:55.113 --> 05:56.425
Do you want one?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.568
I'm calling it,
pizza and pants off.

06:06.607 --> 06:08.575
Hey, babe.Hi, Kath.

06:08.678 --> 06:10.991
I just wanted to check in that
you're okay.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.580
You seemed a bit...
distant today.

06:13.683 --> 06:15.789
Connor and I had a fight
on the way to the service.

06:15.892 --> 06:17.653
About the adoption? Uh, no.

06:17.756 --> 06:20.345
He didn't like the shoes
that I made him wear.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.312
So you still haven't told him.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.419
I came close but the timing
doesn't feel right.

06:25.523 --> 06:27.214
The timing may
never feel right.

06:27.317 --> 06:29.285
I think it will.
After round one.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.874
I think we both know
that will never happen.

06:31.977 --> 06:34.255
I think you'll find that
you're underestimating me.

06:34.359 --> 06:36.499
It's the third call
from Mum today.

06:36.603 --> 06:38.052
I'm going to answer it.

06:38.156 --> 06:40.469
Kath, I've gotta go.

06:40.572 --> 06:41.815
You are not answering that.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.299
She's not going away.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.507
She'll want to know about today.
We're both here.

06:44.611 --> 06:45.991
We can tell her
about the engagement.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.579
You haven't told her yet?!

06:47.683 --> 06:49.961
You said you wanted to tell her.

06:50.064 --> 06:51.928
I do.Right. I'm calling her back.

06:52.032 --> 06:53.758
Not now!

06:53.861 --> 06:56.070
Why not?Because we have just come back

06:56.174 --> 06:58.694
from Jack's memorial and there
has been so much sadness

06:58.797 --> 07:00.799
and so much emotion...

07:00.903 --> 07:03.077
And I don't even know
how I feel anymore.

07:03.181 --> 07:05.494
What's that supposed to mean?

07:05.597 --> 07:08.289
Nothing.
Nothing, I'm just...

07:08.393 --> 07:10.050
Babe, I'm spent.

07:10.153 --> 07:13.674
And I'm too raw
to face your mother.

07:13.778 --> 07:15.745
Hey.

07:15.849 --> 07:18.196
Just picture her face
on our wedding day.

07:25.548 --> 07:28.275
Hi, Jade.
I'm so sorry we're late.

07:28.378 --> 07:29.863
That's okay.

07:29.966 --> 07:32.210
Um, any chance you could do
another night this week?

07:32.313 --> 07:33.694
Or next week?
Any night.

07:33.798 --> 07:36.248
I've got exams, so...Oh. Okay.

07:36.352 --> 07:38.458
No -- got to prioritize
schoolwork.

07:38.561 --> 07:40.839
I mean, I could pay you more.
I'm just kidding.

07:40.943 --> 07:43.083
I'm not really kidding.
How are your weekends?

07:43.186 --> 07:45.706
I'm busy.
Okay.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.708
All right.
Thank you.

07:47.812 --> 07:50.400
Boy:
I...guess that's okay.

07:56.027 --> 07:57.994
Right.
Tees and wees.

07:58.098 --> 08:00.031
Come on.
You know the drill.

08:07.935 --> 08:10.490
I can't stop thinking
about little J.J.

08:12.802 --> 08:16.565
I feel like such an arsehole
even saying it, but...

08:16.668 --> 08:19.947
I just keep thanking God
it wasn't you.

08:20.051 --> 08:21.570
But it wasn't me.

08:21.673 --> 08:23.192
You know?

08:23.295 --> 08:24.918
I'm right here.

08:28.611 --> 08:31.890
Dad!
Abby's annoying.

08:31.994 --> 08:35.238
Come on, you guys.

08:35.342 --> 08:36.585
Kath: Jessie wants answers.

08:36.688 --> 08:40.105
If she needs someone to blame,
it's on me.

08:40.209 --> 08:41.659
He was there
because I told him to be.

08:41.762 --> 08:43.108
He was under my care.No.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.558
You've done more than enough.

08:44.662 --> 08:47.181
I mean, back and forth
with the police all day,

08:47.285 --> 08:49.459
you've been more
than cooperative.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.223
You were incredible today.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.397
You were there for everyone
but yourself.

09:01.506 --> 09:03.922
Talking to Jessie today,

09:04.026 --> 09:06.649
I had nothing.

09:14.415 --> 09:17.384
Take it.

09:17.487 --> 09:19.800
There's nothing we can do
till tomorrow now.

09:27.394 --> 09:30.708
The cops reckon it's unlikely
Jack's head injury

09:30.811 --> 09:33.262
was caused
by falling out of a kayak.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.198
What does that mean?

09:38.301 --> 09:41.132
It might not have been
an accident.

09:44.169 --> 09:46.724
I think Jessie and I had a bit
of a nice moment today.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.104
I told her how I wanted
to tell everyone

09:48.208 --> 09:50.072
to fuck off at Nan's wake.

09:50.175 --> 09:52.764
How'd that go?Really well.

09:52.868 --> 09:55.456
She said the hardest thing
is she still doesn't understand

09:55.560 --> 09:58.736
what happened.

09:58.839 --> 10:00.151
I keep...

10:00.254 --> 10:02.774
going over it.

10:02.878 --> 10:04.396
-Jack!
-Help!

10:04.500 --> 10:06.847
We did everything we could. Help!

10:06.951 --> 10:08.435
But Jack wasn't breathing

10:08.538 --> 10:12.025
when Rusty pulled him
out of the water.

10:12.128 --> 10:15.476
I've been debating whether
or not to tell you something.

10:15.580 --> 10:18.410
I saw Rusty with Jessie
at Kath's place,

10:18.514 --> 10:20.827
just the two of them
in one of the bedrooms.

10:20.930 --> 10:22.380
What were they doing
in the bedroom?

10:22.483 --> 10:25.383
Having a seriously
intimate chat.

10:25.486 --> 10:30.077
After talking to Jessie today,
and seeing Rusty with J.J.,

10:30.181 --> 10:32.355
I mean,
they're clearly best mates.

10:32.459 --> 10:33.874
How weird is that?

10:33.978 --> 10:35.393
What if they're having
an affair

10:35.496 --> 10:37.913
and that's why Rusty
and Jack hated each other?

10:38.016 --> 10:40.881
That's a big if.Yeah, but what if I'm right?

11:08.253 --> 11:09.703
I didn't wake you up?

11:09.807 --> 11:11.325
No.

11:11.429 --> 11:12.810
That's how tired I was.

11:16.434 --> 11:18.263
Well, you woke me up.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.610
Oh, yeah?

11:20.714 --> 11:22.198
You've started snoring.

11:25.339 --> 11:27.307
Bullshit.

11:39.837 --> 11:41.562
You should answer it.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.015
Morning.

11:48.604 --> 11:50.226
Yeah.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.818
Here you are!
How are you feeling?

11:55.922 --> 11:57.475
Walk with me.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.235
There's a bit of a buzz
about you starting.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.997
We've got a couple of
footy fans on the staff.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.104
You are the closest thing
we've come to celebrity.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.106
I was hoping to ease you
into the staff room,

12:08.210 --> 12:09.901
or as we like to call it,
the panic room,

12:10.005 --> 12:13.180
but I'm going to have to
drop you in the deep end.

12:13.284 --> 12:14.354
Ah, Brodie Schneider.

12:14.457 --> 12:15.735
Paige Dunkeley.

12:15.838 --> 12:17.115
Math nerd.
Welcome aboard.

12:17.219 --> 12:18.185
Thanks.
-No, not you, me.

12:18.289 --> 12:19.186
I'm the nerd.
-Oh, I am...

12:19.290 --> 12:21.741
Yep, me too.
-Oh!

12:21.844 --> 12:24.882
We were all so sorry
to hear about Jack.

12:24.985 --> 12:26.607
It's just devastating.

12:26.711 --> 12:28.264
He had a little boy,
didn't he?

12:28.368 --> 12:29.749
Mm.

12:29.852 --> 12:31.267
Makes you realize
what's important,

12:31.371 --> 12:33.200
doesn't it?

12:36.997 --> 12:38.999
Don't let them
smell your fear.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.384
Good morning, everyone.

12:44.487 --> 12:47.801
And a warm welcome, please,
for Miss Dunkeley.

12:47.905 --> 12:49.492
All : Good morning,
Miss Dunkeley.

12:49.596 --> 12:50.804
Good morning, everyone.

12:50.908 --> 12:53.738
I'm so excited to be here.

12:53.842 --> 12:55.567
Right.
Pay attention.

12:55.671 --> 12:57.984
You may actually
learn something.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.443
Okay, well, this isn't fair.

13:09.547 --> 13:11.687
I'm actually a big fan
of laughter.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.345
Anything in the hoverboard
stack family,

13:14.448 --> 13:17.900
trampoline injuries
or my personal favorite,

13:18.004 --> 13:19.764
total face plants.

13:19.868 --> 13:22.871
So would anyone like to share
the joke with me?

13:25.701 --> 13:28.048
Excellent. Please introduce
yourself and fire away.

13:28.152 --> 13:31.603
I'm Yasmin and we're
all laughing at this.

13:36.885 --> 13:38.196
You've gone viral.

13:48.897 --> 13:52.417
Jack's initial toxicology
came back with a few surprises.

13:52.521 --> 13:54.695
Aside from the antidepressants
you prescribed him,

13:54.799 --> 13:57.802
they also found two different
medications in his system.

13:57.906 --> 14:01.426
Oxycodone and Xanax.

14:01.530 --> 14:04.395
Did you give him the scripts?

14:04.498 --> 14:06.017
No competent doctor
would prescribe

14:06.121 --> 14:07.570
that combination of drugs.

14:07.674 --> 14:10.470
I had to ask.

14:10.573 --> 14:11.609
We'll need a statement,

14:11.712 --> 14:13.714
get ahead of the media
if we can.

14:13.818 --> 14:16.407
I'm not questioning
your competence.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.892
I'm just trying to protect you
from the shit storm.

14:18.996 --> 14:20.100
You don't need to.

14:20.204 --> 14:21.308
Well, what if I want to?

14:24.035 --> 14:25.554
Take it.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.422
Yeah?

14:31.525 --> 14:33.942
They reduce many to tears
within minutes of every class.

14:34.045 --> 14:35.978
Heartless
little bastards.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.393
It wasn't even a full class.

14:37.497 --> 14:38.947
There were
five students absent!

14:39.050 --> 14:40.983
I'm so sorry
they were so loud.

14:41.087 --> 14:44.021
They only made as much noise
as you allowed them to.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.608
Yeah, it was just...
it was just the laughter.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.093
Everything I said
made it worse.

14:47.196 --> 14:49.198
I know that you are here
for the right reasons

14:49.302 --> 14:51.304
and that's why
I took a punt on you.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.168
But if you can't control
the students,

14:53.271 --> 14:55.308
I'll have to give Jim
back his classes.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.517
No, I can.
And I will.

14:59.968 --> 15:01.210
She's not gonna sack you
till you get her

15:01.314 --> 15:04.179
a signed
poster of Connor Marrello.

15:04.282 --> 15:05.905
I'm kidding.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.354
I mean, it wouldn't hurt
if you could get her one.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.598
She never misses a game.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.048
She roped me in
two years ago.

15:11.151 --> 15:12.394
We go to every home game.

15:12.497 --> 15:14.085
Isn't that some sort
of abuse of power?

15:14.189 --> 15:16.191
Totally. But if you want
out of her bad books,

15:16.294 --> 15:17.847
a drink at the footy
goes a long way.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.988
You reckon?Works for me.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.066
In front of me, Con!

15:29.169 --> 15:32.138
-Good job, Jase.
-Get it, mate.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.898
Rusty!

15:41.664 --> 15:44.357
How you going, mate?

15:46.462 --> 15:48.706
Off the record, your version of
what happened on the water

15:48.809 --> 15:51.088
doesn't match up
with the post-mortem results.

15:51.191 --> 15:52.813
Is there anything you forgot
to tell me?

15:52.917 --> 15:54.954
Is that a trick question?

15:55.057 --> 15:58.474
If there's anything you want
to say, anything at all,

15:58.578 --> 16:00.407
now would be the time.

16:02.892 --> 16:06.793
I can't protect you
if you don't level with me.

16:10.831 --> 16:13.524
I don't know what
you want me to say.

16:13.627 --> 16:16.251
All right? I already told you
and the police everything.

16:16.354 --> 16:18.253
I believe you, mate.

16:18.356 --> 16:19.806
But given your history
with Jack,

16:19.909 --> 16:22.015
I'm not sure everyone else will.

16:28.539 --> 16:31.714
No.
Yeah, I promise.

16:31.818 --> 16:34.165
Look, there's nothing
you could do here anyway.

16:34.269 --> 16:35.856
Stay.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.928
Yeah, yeah.
We're all doing the best we can.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.930
Tahlia?

16:41.034 --> 16:42.760
Nah, she --
she's out for a run.

16:42.863 --> 16:45.107
Yeah, she sends her love.

16:45.211 --> 16:48.490
Yeah, I love you too.
Bye.

16:48.593 --> 16:50.664
Okay, what have I done?

16:50.768 --> 16:52.804
You have been waiting years
to ruin my mum's day

16:52.908 --> 16:54.427
with our engagement and now,
all of a sudden,

16:54.530 --> 16:55.945
you're not ready?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.913
Enough bullshit!
What's going on?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.881
Bullshit?
I haven't lied to you once.

17:00.985 --> 17:03.401
Not one time since the day
that we met.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.438
Of course I want to blow your
mother's mind with this news

17:05.541 --> 17:06.887
but I don't want
to do it right now

17:06.991 --> 17:08.372
because I hate her guts
and she hates mine.

17:08.475 --> 17:10.132
But that's not exactly
breaking news.

17:10.236 --> 17:12.962
You know what is? I went looking
for your birth certificate.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.412
And you know what I found?

17:14.516 --> 17:16.621
She's not even your real
fucking mother.

17:16.725 --> 17:19.279
Darling, put me on speaker.

17:22.662 --> 17:24.560
-Mum?
-That's much better.

17:24.664 --> 17:26.079
Please go on, Tahlia.

17:26.183 --> 17:27.563
You were up to:

17:27.667 --> 17:29.600
I'm not even
his real fucking mother.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.541
You really hurt her feelings.I don't care.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.132
Why didn't you tell me?

17:44.235 --> 17:46.099
I don't know.

17:46.203 --> 17:48.170
I wasn't, like, deliberately
withholding it from you.

17:48.274 --> 17:50.552
I just...
Never came up.

17:50.655 --> 17:52.450
Except it did.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.176
When I asked you
for your birth certificate.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.971
Maybe it should have occurred
to me, but...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.179
it didn't.

17:57.283 --> 17:58.939
It's not something
I think about.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.182
Maybe I was scared...

18:00.286 --> 18:02.633
it would make things
worse between you two.

18:02.736 --> 18:04.911
Between us.

18:05.014 --> 18:08.328
I really thought that we were
past all the lying.

18:08.432 --> 18:09.467
And this one hurts.

18:09.571 --> 18:10.813
I didn't lie this time.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.195
When were you gonna tell me?

18:13.299 --> 18:15.439
Were you gonna let me marry you
without saying anything?

18:15.542 --> 18:16.957
I doubt it.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.821
It's just bullshit.

18:18.925 --> 18:21.065
You didn't trust me enough
to tell me.

18:29.315 --> 18:31.938
I've been going round and round
in circles in my head

18:32.041 --> 18:34.251
about this, and...

18:34.354 --> 18:36.839
just to be clear, I'm not saying
that this...

18:36.943 --> 18:40.809
this is the solution, um...

18:40.912 --> 18:44.088
but I just think with Jack's
passing, that maybe...

18:44.192 --> 18:47.333
maybe we should consider
the possibility that...

18:47.436 --> 18:50.336
now's not the time for you
to be less involved at the club.

18:52.752 --> 18:54.581
Am I being ridiculous?

18:54.685 --> 18:56.963
I am!

18:57.066 --> 19:00.725
It's just a kneejerk reaction
to an unthinkable situation.

19:05.730 --> 19:07.387
What?Nah, I didn't say anything.

19:07.491 --> 19:09.182
I'm...
listening.

19:09.286 --> 19:10.908
What are you not telling me?

19:11.011 --> 19:13.082
You forgot to pick up
one of the kids?

19:13.186 --> 19:14.774
You stacked the car again?

19:14.877 --> 19:16.603
No!
Uh...

19:16.707 --> 19:17.811
Got another parking fine.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.261
But...

19:19.365 --> 19:22.885
Signed on to play another year?

19:22.989 --> 19:24.232
Mmm.

19:24.335 --> 19:27.925
I didn't want to have to say it,
but, uh...

19:28.028 --> 19:29.754
yeah.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.515
Are you fucking serious?!

19:31.618 --> 19:33.413
Wha--I was joking!

19:33.517 --> 19:34.863
I know this wasn't a part
of our plan,

19:34.966 --> 19:37.452
and I didn't mean
for it to happen.

19:37.555 --> 19:38.660
I -- I'm not even sure
how it would happen.

19:38.763 --> 19:40.040
But, look...

19:40.144 --> 19:41.939
Listen, I can see
that you're very angry

19:42.042 --> 19:43.630
and I don't blame you.
Uh...

19:43.734 --> 19:47.116
Just let me get this out and
then you can tear me to shreds.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.015
Brian's been in my ear.

19:49.118 --> 19:51.086
"Oh, we need ya, Trav.
Just one more year."

19:51.190 --> 19:53.053
He's said that for three years
in a row!

19:53.157 --> 19:55.055
Yeah, well, this time,
I agreed with him.

19:55.159 --> 19:57.679
You've agreed with him
every year!

19:57.782 --> 19:59.508
He wore me down.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.545
And I spoke to the other guys
and they're not in a good place

20:01.648 --> 20:04.720
and I --
I can't just walk away.

20:04.824 --> 20:06.170
Sorry, can I just ask
how long ago

20:06.274 --> 20:10.554
you made this life-changing
decision without me?

20:10.657 --> 20:11.831
Yesterday.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.039
You're telling me
that Brian asked you

20:13.142 --> 20:14.420
to sign a contract
at Jack's wake?

20:14.523 --> 20:15.835
No! Well...

20:15.938 --> 20:17.008
I shook his hand.

20:17.112 --> 20:18.424
So you haven't
signed anything?

20:18.527 --> 20:19.839
We shook hands.

20:19.942 --> 20:21.668
I never would've
done this to you.

20:21.772 --> 20:23.912
I know that. And --
I'm sorry.

20:34.509 --> 20:36.821
Mate, what is wrong with you?

20:36.925 --> 20:39.307
Haven't you ever lost
anyone before?

20:39.410 --> 20:41.101
Great.
Doesn't that feel better?

20:43.863 --> 20:46.072
Ho-ho!

20:46.175 --> 20:47.867
Ah.

20:49.938 --> 20:52.492
I love that you tell people
to fuck off at a funeral.

20:52.596 --> 20:55.288
Oh, I didn't say it out loud,
just in my head.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.497
Doesn't matter, I love
that you were thinking it.

20:57.601 --> 21:01.225
And you said it to me
when I was thinking it.

21:01.329 --> 21:02.744
Now I'm finally on my own.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.782
It's just me and J.J.

21:09.578 --> 21:13.272
And it feels worse.

21:15.481 --> 21:18.760
That makes sense.

21:18.863 --> 21:20.244
Um...

21:20.348 --> 21:21.625
Do you want wine?

21:21.728 --> 21:23.005
Yes.Yeah?

21:23.109 --> 21:24.766
Okay, let's do that.

21:24.869 --> 21:27.182
Ah, red or white?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.874
Don't care.
Love it all.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.152
I really like your lack
of bullshit, Paige.

21:32.256 --> 21:33.464
It's not really
a conscious choice,

21:33.568 --> 21:35.017
it's more of a default setting.

21:35.121 --> 21:36.812
Doesn't always land well.

21:39.263 --> 21:40.954
Hey, I've been...

21:41.058 --> 21:42.577
meaning to talk to you
about something.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.165
Yeah?
Um...

21:45.269 --> 21:46.822
I didn't wanna interfere,

21:46.926 --> 21:48.583
but I think you and I
might be similar in some ways.

21:48.686 --> 21:50.895
And after Jack's wake,
I feel like I should

21:50.999 --> 21:52.863
be up-front with you.

21:52.966 --> 21:55.072
Okay.
About what?

21:55.175 --> 21:58.075
I saw you with Rusty
at Kath's place.

21:58.178 --> 22:00.836
I overheard the two of you.What did you hear?

22:00.940 --> 22:03.287
Ah, hardly anything.

22:03.391 --> 22:06.255
I just wanted to say if there's
anything going on and...

22:06.359 --> 22:07.809
you want a friendly ear,
I'm here.

22:07.912 --> 22:09.707
Without any judgment.

22:09.811 --> 22:12.779
I know how complicated
things can be.

22:12.883 --> 22:15.023
That was a private conversation
between friends.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.265
You have no idea
what you heard?

22:16.369 --> 22:17.577
No, no.
And I really hadn't...

22:17.681 --> 22:20.235
Um, I didn't mean to imply...

22:20.339 --> 22:22.237
Um, I just...
I just wanna be supportive.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.653
Maybe you should stop being
so concerned

22:24.757 --> 22:26.103
with other people's business

22:26.206 --> 22:27.794
and try supporting
Daniel instead.

22:27.898 --> 22:30.245
He's the one everyone's
worried about.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.385
What?
He didn't tell you?

22:32.489 --> 22:34.836
Yeah, he was there
when Jack died.

22:34.939 --> 22:37.252
So, maybe you should go home
and talk to him --

22:37.356 --> 22:39.634
without any judgment.

22:48.021 --> 22:49.954
Oh, my God, I think I screw--

22:50.058 --> 22:52.716
Hello!
What a nice surprise.

22:52.819 --> 22:54.959
Your boy is about to play
his first game

22:55.063 --> 22:56.927
of professional footy.

22:57.030 --> 23:00.206
How do you feel?

23:00.309 --> 23:02.795
It's any other game,
anticipate distractions,

23:02.898 --> 23:04.348
manage expectations...Try and get my hands

23:04.452 --> 23:06.246
on the ball.That's it.

23:08.007 --> 23:09.664
Counting on you to get him
to me in one piece.

23:09.767 --> 23:10.699
Roger that.

23:10.803 --> 23:12.356
See you at training.See ya.

23:12.460 --> 23:15.773
I've been sweating bullets
for the last half an hour.

23:15.877 --> 23:18.535
You're gonna be brilliant.

23:18.638 --> 23:20.502
What did you screw?Oh, nothing.

23:20.606 --> 23:22.297
Just myself.
Had a bit of a weird one.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.196
Ah, tell you what I didn't do,

23:25.300 --> 23:27.923
I did not just get called up
for my first game

23:28.027 --> 23:29.649
in the big-boy sandpit!

23:29.753 --> 23:31.064
No-one calls it that.Don't care.

23:31.168 --> 23:33.135
Very proud.
You're gonna kill it.

23:37.174 --> 23:39.210
Announcer: Well, the long wait
is finally over.

23:39.314 --> 23:40.936
Round one is upon us.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.007
Preparations are done,
all players,

23:43.111 --> 23:45.320
the preseason finished,
and we're ready to go

23:45.424 --> 23:47.046
for what should be
a massive day.

24:01.957 --> 24:04.408
I thought
I was in the doghouse.

24:04.512 --> 24:06.375
Oh, you are.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.999
Very much so.

24:09.102 --> 24:10.759
But it's game day,

24:10.863 --> 24:13.762
and I just had
a dream about Roger Federer.

24:13.866 --> 24:16.178
Ooh... Ooh!

24:38.960 --> 24:42.273
Babe, slow down.

24:42.377 --> 24:44.137
Oh, babe...

24:44.241 --> 24:46.001
Seriously, slow down.

24:46.105 --> 24:47.451
Okay.

24:47.555 --> 24:48.970
Oh, no --

24:49.073 --> 24:50.419
Ah --

24:50.523 --> 24:53.146
Seriously, you might
even have to --

24:57.426 --> 25:00.153
Oh! Oh!
Ohhhhh!

25:00.257 --> 25:02.673
Oh, what happened?
Didn't you hear me?

25:02.777 --> 25:05.020
I heard you.

25:05.124 --> 25:07.609
You may consider this
small payback

25:07.713 --> 25:10.578
for signing that fucking
contract without consulting me.

25:10.681 --> 25:12.580
What if I play
a shit game now?

25:12.683 --> 25:16.791
What if you play the best
game of your life?

25:16.894 --> 25:19.448
Hm?
Mm.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.389
Phew!

25:29.493 --> 25:30.770
Don't get used to it,
I'm not gonna do this

25:30.874 --> 25:32.703
before every game.Oh, what?!

25:32.807 --> 25:34.084
Why not?Once a season

25:34.187 --> 25:35.775
is my best
and final offer.

25:35.879 --> 25:37.156
Unless you make the granny.

25:37.259 --> 25:38.709
And don't eat the avocado,
it's not ripe.

25:38.813 --> 25:40.504
I just needed something green.
It's just for show.

25:40.608 --> 25:42.817
Oh, look at you
and your fancy greens.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.543
Seriously, don't eat it.

25:44.646 --> 25:46.234
Hey, um...

25:46.337 --> 25:48.408
after the game you have to hang
around for a bit, don't you?

25:48.512 --> 25:50.583
Mm.
Shouldn't be too long.

25:50.687 --> 25:52.274
But, yeah, there's a quick
cool down and debrief.

25:52.378 --> 25:53.655
Why is that? You want to
do something special?

25:53.759 --> 25:56.831
Just you and me?Yes, later.

25:56.934 --> 26:02.457
But first I thought I might just
pop in for those work drinks.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.011
It's just that one drink would
make my life so much easier.

26:05.115 --> 26:07.496
You know how Toni's a huge
Southern Jets fan.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.983
I'm just gonna stick my head in.
Pop in, pop out.

26:11.086 --> 26:12.571
I mean, not that
you'll even see me.

26:12.674 --> 26:17.541
I'll just be one of the fans,
adoring from afar.

26:17.645 --> 26:21.096
I can't even imagine how much
pressure you must be under.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.892
But I'm here for you.
Whatever you need.

26:23.996 --> 26:28.069
If you wanna go the pre-game
shag, I'm down for that.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.105
Or if you just want to watch
your funny videos,

26:30.209 --> 26:34.972
or if you want to get
anything off your chest.

26:35.076 --> 26:38.286
Like what?Anything at all.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.701
What's going on?

26:39.805 --> 26:40.944
It's just that Jessie said
something about

26:41.047 --> 26:42.739
what happened at the river.
And...

26:42.842 --> 26:44.361
I wanted to bring it up
last night

26:44.464 --> 26:45.569
but you were so scared
after Brian left,

26:45.673 --> 26:46.950
I didn't want to freak you out.

26:47.053 --> 26:48.434
What, and now's a better time?

26:48.537 --> 26:50.712
Hey, look, I know
you're handling all this

26:50.816 --> 26:52.196
in your own way,
but you might actually

26:52.300 --> 26:53.612
feel better if you
just talked to me about it.

26:53.715 --> 26:55.199
You can get it off your chest.

26:55.303 --> 26:58.099
Get what off my chest?

26:58.202 --> 27:01.378
She said you were with Jack
when he died.

27:03.173 --> 27:04.830
Look, this is probably
the biggest day of my life

27:04.933 --> 27:06.901
so far, maybe ever.

27:07.004 --> 27:08.765
I could go out there
and not even get near it,

27:08.868 --> 27:11.457
and all this could be over
before it even starts.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.805
I feel like puking and crying
and shitting meself

27:14.909 --> 27:17.394
all at once, and I can't believe
you're doing this now.

27:17.497 --> 27:20.224
Well, I'm sorry,
I tried not to.

27:20.328 --> 27:21.985
You know how I get.

27:22.088 --> 27:23.711
Dan, please come back.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.333
I've got to get
my head together.

27:36.516 --> 27:39.416
Those boys could not be
in better hands.

27:39.519 --> 27:41.038
You know that.

27:41.142 --> 27:45.111
There's at least a 50% chance
that they're gonna fall apart.

27:45.215 --> 27:48.080
I still don't know what
I'm gonna say to them.

27:48.183 --> 27:49.944
It'll come to you.

27:50.047 --> 27:51.531
It always does.

27:55.812 --> 27:56.951
Announcer: Good afternoon,
and welcome

27:57.054 --> 27:58.400
to Docklands Stadium
in Melbourne.

27:58.504 --> 28:00.955
It's round one action,
the crowd's filing in.

28:01.058 --> 28:04.406
It's the Southern Jets
taking on the Eastern Dragons.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.477
And as if the pressure
of last year's grand final

28:06.581 --> 28:08.617
wasn't enough,
here's the Southern Jets

28:08.721 --> 28:10.343
heading into their first game
of the season.

28:10.447 --> 28:11.862
Announcer 2:
Yeah, you're spot-on.

28:11.966 --> 28:13.312
And even more loaded up
with the tragic passing

28:13.415 --> 28:14.969
of course of young Jack Davies.

28:15.072 --> 28:16.384
Announcer: And what impact
is it gonna have on this team?

28:16.487 --> 28:17.834
Announcer 2:
It could galvanize them

28:17.937 --> 28:19.214
or it could tear them apart --

28:19.318 --> 28:20.906
and that's the challenge
for the leadership group.

28:21.009 --> 28:23.149
The captain, Connor Marrello,
the coach, Brian Rickards,

28:23.253 --> 28:24.772
and the veteran,
Travis Cochrane's

28:24.875 --> 28:26.359
been called out of retirement.

28:26.463 --> 28:28.016
Well, D.P., I think the whole
football community's

28:28.120 --> 28:29.466
behind them.
-Yeah, with the possible

28:29.569 --> 28:31.571
exception of course
of the opposition fans.

28:31.675 --> 28:33.366
Announcer 2: Even then, D.P.,
if you're not behind

28:33.470 --> 28:35.368
the Southern Jets today, there's
something wrong with you.

28:35.472 --> 28:38.578
Oh, thank God.Look at you.

28:38.682 --> 28:40.339
This is what I always wear
to the footy.

28:40.442 --> 28:42.237
Well, you look
ridiculously cute.

28:42.341 --> 28:44.930
Thanks.That's for you.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.897
Let's do it.

28:47.001 --> 28:49.106
Hey, everyone's looking at us.

28:49.210 --> 28:50.694
They're looking at me.

29:06.779 --> 29:09.092
It's a bit overwhelming,
isn't it?

29:09.195 --> 29:10.645
Overwhelming...
Delightful.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.440
Thank you.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.856
Also confusing and a bit
terrifying.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.271
Yeah, well,
what's even scarier

29:16.375 --> 29:18.757
is how quickly
you'll get used to it.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.344
How was Daniel
this morning?

29:20.448 --> 29:22.277
Bit frazzled, grumpy.

29:22.381 --> 29:23.692
Pretty tense, actually.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.556
Yeah, a few of the players
are a bit like that.

29:25.660 --> 29:28.145
The trick is to
just let them be.

29:28.249 --> 29:29.560
I went for a different
approach.

29:29.664 --> 29:31.804
Mm?I accidentally started a fight.

29:31.908 --> 29:34.703
Oh.
What was the fight about?

29:34.807 --> 29:37.051
Oh, just normal things.

29:37.154 --> 29:40.606
And I floated the idea of having
a drink with my new boss.

29:40.709 --> 29:43.298
Today?Yeah, yeah, she's at the game.

29:43.402 --> 29:44.610
In the members?Yeah, I think so.

29:44.713 --> 29:46.405
Is that where we are?

29:46.508 --> 29:48.407
No, that's on the other side
of the ground.

29:48.510 --> 29:49.442
It's way...

29:49.546 --> 29:51.203
way over there.

29:53.515 --> 29:55.586
You must be so torn.

29:55.690 --> 29:57.140
I know you've just
landed a new job,

29:57.243 --> 29:58.866
and I know how
important it is,

29:58.969 --> 30:01.523
but, you know, work drinks
happen all the time.

30:01.627 --> 30:04.078
But your boy will only play
his first game

30:04.181 --> 30:07.012
of professional football
once in his life.

30:07.115 --> 30:09.117
Yeah, totally.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.430
My eyes will be glued
to every move he makes.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.756
All right?Yeah.

30:39.078 --> 30:42.185
Eyes up.

30:42.288 --> 30:45.360
There's been a lot of talk
in the last 10 days.

30:45.464 --> 30:47.949
Some of the toughest
conversations I've ever had.

30:48.053 --> 30:50.400
But we've always done it
tough at this club.

30:50.503 --> 30:52.091
It's where we come from.

30:52.195 --> 30:54.128
It's how we get the job done.

30:54.231 --> 30:57.096
We never give up,
no matter what.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.065
No matter how hard we get hit.

31:00.168 --> 31:03.102
Now, I'm very proud of the way
you've handled yourselves.

31:03.206 --> 31:04.759
Your preparation's
been exceptional

31:04.863 --> 31:06.795
under the circumstances.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.763
And I'm not gonna pretend
to know how hard it is

31:08.867 --> 31:10.144
for you boys.

31:10.247 --> 31:12.111
And I don't want you to tell me,

31:12.215 --> 31:13.561
I want you to show me.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.770
Out there.That's it, boys.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.601
All the pain and the grief
and the anger,

31:19.705 --> 31:22.018
I want you
to take it all out there.

31:23.536 --> 31:25.228
You've just endured
the hardest two weeks

31:25.331 --> 31:26.954
of your life at this club.

31:27.057 --> 31:31.234
You've been told to keep your
heads down and your mouths shut.

31:31.337 --> 31:32.407
Well, not today!

31:34.133 --> 31:36.584
You've got the opportunity
to represent

31:36.687 --> 31:38.793
the people
turning up out there today,

31:38.897 --> 31:41.313
right now,
tens of thousands of them.

31:41.416 --> 31:43.177
To represent each other,

31:43.280 --> 31:47.353
and to make a statement
about who Jack Davies was

31:47.457 --> 31:49.769
and what he meant
to this football club.

31:52.565 --> 31:54.222
Announcer: It's an enormously
challenging afternoon

31:54.326 --> 31:56.500
for the Southern Jets --
the big question,

31:56.604 --> 31:59.055
how will they respond?
-Well, that's exactly right.

31:59.158 --> 32:00.539
I mean, how can they
pull themselves up

32:00.642 --> 32:03.680
after the tragic loss
of their team-mate?

32:10.756 --> 32:13.276
No, Mommy!
No, no, no!

32:13.379 --> 32:15.795
Don't go!

32:15.899 --> 32:17.866
It's okay, yeah?

32:19.903 --> 32:21.594
It's okay, let's go here.

32:25.150 --> 32:29.361
Let's take James.

32:29.464 --> 32:31.984
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
please be upstanding

32:32.088 --> 32:33.813
as we observe
a moment's silence

32:33.917 --> 32:38.439
to mark the tragic passing
of Jack Alexander Davies.

33:15.372 --> 33:17.926
Announcer: So we're set to go.
Round one, opening bounce.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.928
It's the Southern Jets
and the Eastern Dragons.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.689
Emotions running high.
Can they maintain it?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.104
Announcer 2:
Well, that's the challenge.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.141
They've got to push that emotion
aside early

33:25.244 --> 33:28.351
and just get on with the job.

33:28.454 --> 33:29.593
Announcer: And this game's
turned out to be

33:29.697 --> 33:30.974
everything we hoped it would.

33:31.078 --> 33:32.596
It is going right down
to the wire.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.426
Announcer 2: An absolute
cracker, J.B.

33:34.529 --> 33:36.566
And look at both sides.
They're both fatigued.

33:36.669 --> 33:39.086
All that pre-season training
comes into play now.

33:39.189 --> 33:40.225
Announcer: Looked like it was
all over

33:40.328 --> 33:41.536
at the end of the third quarter.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.917
What a great fight-back
from the Jets.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.539
Just seconds remaining.

33:44.643 --> 33:45.851
Announcer 2: Oh, they were in
all sorts of trouble.

33:45.954 --> 33:47.542
Marrello takes him high.

33:47.646 --> 33:48.923
He's given away the free kick.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.166
Critical moment.

33:50.269 --> 33:51.788
This free kick
going to Nick McFarland.

33:51.891 --> 33:53.721
McFarland's got to find
an option here,

33:53.824 --> 33:55.171
just seconds remaining
in the game.

33:55.274 --> 33:57.414
Come on, boys!He's on the broadcast wing.

33:57.518 --> 34:00.107
This kick
is absolutely critical.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.625
Oh, he's turned it over!

34:01.729 --> 34:02.937
Yes, Russ!O'Reilly's chopped this off.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.456
He's been the difference.

34:04.559 --> 34:06.078
Announcer: What a game he's
played across half-back.

34:06.182 --> 34:08.253
One last roll of the dice
for the Jets now.

34:08.356 --> 34:09.702
O'Reilly will kick it long.

34:09.806 --> 34:11.256
Here's the youngster
Fletcher underneath it.

34:11.359 --> 34:12.774
Another great mark
from Fletcher.

34:12.878 --> 34:14.086
Yes, Fletch!He's got to go.

34:14.190 --> 34:15.674
Seconds ticking down.
-Go, Fletch!

34:15.777 --> 34:16.882
Go, Dan!He plays on.

34:16.985 --> 34:17.917
Wheels onto his right.

34:18.021 --> 34:18.884
Steps through a bit of traffic.

34:18.987 --> 34:20.299
Still going, Fletcher.

34:20.403 --> 34:21.645
Runs to 65.

34:21.749 --> 34:22.922
Steps another man.

34:23.026 --> 34:24.303
Runs to 55.

34:24.407 --> 34:26.202
Siren about to sound.
Fletcher!

34:26.305 --> 34:27.548
-Get it in there!
-Goes himself!

34:27.651 --> 34:28.583
Long bomb!

34:28.687 --> 34:31.103
It's home!
It's home!

34:31.207 --> 34:32.691
The siren!

34:32.794 --> 34:33.968
Unbelievable!

34:34.072 --> 34:35.728
After everything
they've been through,

34:35.832 --> 34:37.972
the youngster steps up
and kicks the winner.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.562
That is exceptional composure
from young Daniel Fletcher

34:41.665 --> 34:44.254
playing his first ever game
at the highest level.

34:44.358 --> 34:46.463
An extraordinary win
for the Jets

34:46.567 --> 34:48.224
that they will never forget.

34:53.160 --> 34:56.232
Um...

34:56.335 --> 34:58.026
Hey, we can leave at any time.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.063
I can take you home.No, it's okay.

35:00.167 --> 35:01.685
I just...
I wanna go.

35:10.660 --> 35:14.284
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

35:14.388 --> 35:17.218
Okay.
Now, nothing can prepare you

35:17.322 --> 35:19.807
for what you're about to smell.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.291
When they come in
after the game.

35:21.395 --> 35:23.293
The saving grace is that they do
head straight down,

35:23.397 --> 35:26.054
have a cool down and debrief
after, then they come off.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.091
And then we go down
to the lounge, we get comfy,

35:28.195 --> 35:30.852
we have a wine or two
and wait for them to meet us.

35:30.956 --> 35:33.096
It can take a while.How long's a while?

35:43.624 --> 35:46.558
Take the mighty Southern Jets
to glory and fame.

35:46.661 --> 35:48.146
Up there, you Jet boys.

35:48.249 --> 35:49.630
Up, up, up!

35:49.733 --> 35:53.012
♪ We'll never rest
till we win the cup ♪

35:53.116 --> 35:54.980
Oh, I don't know
the words yet.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.499
What?! Why not?!

35:56.602 --> 35:58.259
I don't really
have a reason.

35:58.363 --> 35:59.881
I just haven't
gotten round to it.

35:59.985 --> 36:01.642
I will!

36:01.745 --> 36:04.921
Is there any chance that you
could introduce me to Connor?

36:05.024 --> 36:06.474
I'm not sure...

36:06.578 --> 36:09.995
Doesn't have to be Connor,
could be anyone.

36:10.098 --> 36:11.790
Yeah, I suppose I could.

36:11.893 --> 36:15.311
♪ Up, go you Jet boys,
up, up, up! ♪

36:30.084 --> 36:31.603
You were
extraordinary.

36:31.706 --> 36:33.777
You did it.You told me I could.

36:33.881 --> 36:35.503
Yeah, well, I had faith in you,
but we both know

36:35.607 --> 36:38.092
it could have gone either way.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.406
Proud of you.

36:41.509 --> 36:44.271
They're gonna formally announce
the inquest next week.

36:48.827 --> 36:50.898
Hello again.
I was here earlier.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.727
-Pass.
-She's a G, mate,

36:52.831 --> 36:54.246
as in wife or girlfriend.

36:54.350 --> 36:57.836
You might wanna step aside...
Dev.

36:57.939 --> 37:01.115
Show him your pass.No pass, no entry.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.808
Oh, I left it inside.

37:09.123 --> 37:12.368
Hey!
There he is, man of the hour.

37:12.471 --> 37:15.336
How do you feel?A bit dazed,
to tell you the truth.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.373
Have you seen Paige?Yes.

37:17.476 --> 37:19.237
She's just popped out
for a quick work drink.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.962
Just a stone's throw away.
She'll be back soon.

37:21.066 --> 37:23.241
But I'll tell you what, whatever
you two did this morning

37:23.344 --> 37:24.828
you should
make a habit of that.

37:24.932 --> 37:27.245
That has got to be the best
debut performance

37:27.348 --> 37:28.694
I've ever seen.
Hm?

37:28.798 --> 37:31.732
You should be really proud, eh?

37:34.355 --> 37:38.083
Well...
congratulations.

37:38.186 --> 37:39.878
Kath must have been
buttering you up.

37:39.981 --> 37:41.535
Yeah, it's
a bit uncomfortable.

37:44.607 --> 37:45.987
Are you gonna cut out all

37:46.091 --> 37:48.369
the articles
in the paper tomorrow, eh?

37:48.473 --> 37:51.338
Hi, this is Dan.
You know what to do.

38:02.728 --> 38:05.144
I'm sorry.

38:05.248 --> 38:06.422
I shouldn't have signed
on another year

38:06.525 --> 38:08.700
without talking to you.

38:08.803 --> 38:11.530
It was selfish and irresponsible
and I was wrong.

38:11.634 --> 38:14.292
More wrong than
you've ever been before?

38:14.395 --> 38:17.778
Ooh, it's gotta be
up there.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.469
I know how long
you've wanted this.

38:19.573 --> 38:21.299
And you've worked your arse off
and you deserve

38:21.402 --> 38:24.371
this partnership,
and I'm gonna make it right.

38:25.855 --> 38:28.375
We'll work it out.

38:28.478 --> 38:31.412
Well, you'll work it out and
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

38:31.516 --> 38:34.277
So, did I ruin your game?

38:34.381 --> 38:36.175
Going over the edge.

38:36.279 --> 38:37.556
Any difference at all?

38:37.660 --> 38:39.558
Well, that's too
early to call.

38:50.189 --> 38:53.779
I don't know
why I didn't tell you.

38:53.883 --> 38:56.264
I don't know what it means...

38:56.368 --> 38:59.820
...to me or about me.

38:59.923 --> 39:02.995
I don't give a flying fuck
where you came from,

39:03.099 --> 39:04.445
and I can't believe
I even have to say that.

39:04.549 --> 39:06.551
You don't.

39:06.654 --> 39:08.691
Well, apparently I do.

39:11.038 --> 39:12.488
You don't.

39:16.871 --> 39:20.116
I haven't met her.

39:20.219 --> 39:23.119
I don't know if I'm ready.

39:23.222 --> 39:24.741
It's okay.

39:34.233 --> 39:35.718
Daniel: Did you see it?!

39:35.821 --> 39:37.375
Paige : Yes, I saw you
kick the winning goal!

39:37.478 --> 39:40.412
I've never felt like that before
in my entire life.

39:40.516 --> 39:45.486
It was insane.
I was just, like, flying.

39:45.590 --> 39:50.664
And then we've all gone
into the change rooms and...

39:50.767 --> 39:52.907
Jack's jumper's
just sitting there.

39:54.944 --> 39:57.567
It all just evaporated.

39:57.671 --> 39:59.604
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you after the game.

39:59.707 --> 40:01.260
I thought I could suck up
to my new boss

40:01.364 --> 40:03.262
and get back
without you even knowing.

40:03.366 --> 40:05.955
And I am so sorry
about this morning.

40:06.058 --> 40:07.439
It was not the right time.

40:07.543 --> 40:11.409
In my head I was trying
to help you, but...

40:11.512 --> 40:14.791
I was wrong.

40:14.895 --> 40:18.657
There is a reason I didn't want
to talk about Jack's death.

40:21.764 --> 40:23.593
I tried...

40:23.697 --> 40:26.354
Move!I tried to save him.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.495
One, two, three...I tried CPR.

40:28.598 --> 40:30.117
I tried everything.

40:30.220 --> 40:33.361
I was told not to say
anything to anyone.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.949
Not even you.

40:35.053 --> 40:37.573
Who said that?
The club?

40:46.305 --> 40:49.895
Oh.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.864
You all right?Yeah, just got caught.

40:52.967 --> 40:54.900
Give us a hand?Nah, leave him there.

40:55.004 --> 40:56.833
Soft prick.

40:56.937 --> 40:58.525
Toughen up, princess!

41:07.810 --> 41:09.777
Paige:
What happened then?

41:09.881 --> 41:13.609
I don't know.

41:13.712 --> 41:16.163
The next time we saw Jack,

41:16.266 --> 41:18.406
he was dead.
