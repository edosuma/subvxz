00:09.635 --> 00:10.844
Thanks for hanging out, man.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.471
I've been going
a little stir-crazy.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.139
It's not all bad, though, actually,

00:14.139 --> 00:16.099
'cause I've been getting
pretty into artisanal wallpaper.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.143
It's a really cool community.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.229
Finally.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.191
You know, as cool
as your bachelor life sounds,

00:24.191 --> 00:26.151
I do think you should
get out more.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.111
Maybe meet someone.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.905
I don't know.
I mean, I'm not even divorced.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.698
Doesn't have to be
anything serious.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.200
I like serious, though.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.701
You know, I'm much more
of a relationship guy

00:34.701 --> 00:36.161
than I am a sex guy.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.039
Ah. There's a little sex guy
in all of us.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.208
Well, now I'm imagining
a little sex guy

00:41.208 --> 00:42.876
inside of me,
which I do not love.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.420
What if you and me,
we go out,

00:45.420 --> 00:47.172
have a boys' night.
If you meet a lady, dope.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.675
If not, no worries.
Super low-key.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.469
Um, yeah, that sounds good.
I'll-- I'll try.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.430
- Gonna play?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.517
Hey.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.977
What is that, 21-1?

00:59.977 --> 01:02.479
Yeah, it's 21-1.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.716
Uh, wanted to talk to you
about the...

01:30.716 --> 01:33.135
about the hot goss.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.345
- The what?
- Like, I'm new here,

01:35.345 --> 01:36.722
so I'm, like,
getting up to speed.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.599
So, who's weird?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.058
Who's cool?

01:40.058 --> 01:43.228
Who do we avoid, right?
Like, who's the worst?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.314
I really don't want
to do this, okay?

01:45.314 --> 01:47.441
I-I mean, I used to do stuff
like this all the time,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.109
but now I just want to work.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.402
- So...
- Come on, I got no one

01:50.402 --> 01:52.029
to talk to about this stuff.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.947
What about Aaron in sales?
Like...

01:53.947 --> 01:55.282
- Come on.
- He's not annoying?

01:55.282 --> 01:56.616
Come on, you can't tell me
he's not.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.201
But he's cute;
he, like, dresses well,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.411
so he's got that going for him.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.122
You can't say that.
You're his boss.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.876
Can I say handsome?
What about swank?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.085
- No.
- Foxy.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.129
- What?
- Looking foxy.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.256
- Ugh, don't say "foxy."
- What's wrong with that?

02:11.256 --> 02:13.425
Oh, come on, man.
What is guys' obsession

02:13.425 --> 02:15.302
with complimenting
the way people look?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.304
Like, what do you think
is gonna happen if you don't?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.898
Actually, you know what?
This is a hot take.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.691
- It is?
- Yes, this is like,

02:29.691 --> 02:32.486
is this the end of compliments
in the workplace?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.071
That's really good, Sam,

02:34.071 --> 02:35.614
- I want you to write that up.
- Okay.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.449
We'll call it
"Sam's Hot Takes."

02:37.449 --> 02:39.451
Cool, yeah, I-I would love that.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.994
You could just do
a regular thing.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.080
What if we call it this:

02:43.080 --> 02:45.040

02:45.040 --> 02:47.626
It's your perspective,
it's your angle.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.128
Right. Yeah, no, let me, uh,
let me think about that.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.838
- Sleep on it, sleep on it.
- Okay, yeah.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.049
Ooh! "Sober Sam Sleeps On It."

02:54.049 --> 02:56.134
Yeah, okay.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.136
Picture your, like, bio, and
it's, like, a drawing of you,

02:58.136 --> 03:00.472
and you're, like,
chewing on your pen,

03:00.472 --> 03:02.140
and you're drooling
'cause you're sleeping,

03:02.140 --> 03:05.936
and then the drool becomes

03:27.833 --> 03:30.752

to attend meetings

every single day
to live a normal life.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.351
Well, you don't have
to go to meetings

03:46.351 --> 03:48.019
every single day, Samantha.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.355
Yes.
Unfortunately, I do.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.191
And so do most of the people
that I've dated recently.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.026

03:59.364 --> 04:02.701
I don't know.
It's probably not that bad.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.245
Well, you can never really know
a person, though, can you?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.746
BOB:
You know, your mom's not wrong.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.582
It wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world

04:08.582 --> 04:10.333
if you carried a little
pepper spray with you.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.252

04:12.252 --> 04:14.337
this had to be like 15,
20 years ago...

04:14.337 --> 04:16.423
- Bob?
- Real quick.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.300
I was big in the
anarcho-environmentalist scene.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.470
What I didn't realize, though,
was that the cartels

04:21.470 --> 04:23.388
were targeting
the oil company protestors.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.848
So, when we fly down there,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.808
and I'm with,
I'm with Squirrel and Jerry...

04:26.808 --> 04:27.976
Okay, what's happening?

04:27.976 --> 04:29.311
'Cause my Uber's almost here,
so I need to...

04:29.311 --> 04:31.897
- He is driving me crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

04:31.897 --> 04:35.317
He recorded <i>Guy's Grocery Games</i>
on my DVR.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.027
- So what?
- So...

04:37.027 --> 04:38.612
he deleted my Swedish mystery.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.364
Now, I don't know
how <i>Jordskott</i> ends.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.451
I cannot escape him.
He's always here

04:44.451 --> 04:46.453
- playing his stupid guitar.
- Okay.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.914
And why is his shirt
in my closet?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.208
He has a perfectly good wardrobe
down in the garage.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.752
Okay, Mom,
if he's bothering you this much,

04:53.752 --> 04:56.004
- maybe you should take a break.
- What do you mean?

04:56.004 --> 04:59.758
I mean, if it's not working
with Bob, then end it.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.136
Why would you say that?
Do you not want me to be happy?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.429
Yes, I want you to be happy.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.598
I'm saying, if you're not--
you--

05:06.598 --> 05:08.600
I'm trying to be supportive.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.936
Oh, well, there's supportive,
and there's undermining.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.896
And I need space.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.649

- Why don't you kill me?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.365

Bob, she needs space.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.492
Oh, sp...
(clicks tongue)

05:25.492 --> 05:27.327
All right, that was
the context clue I was missing.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.412
Um, well, I'm gonna go
to the grocery store

05:29.412 --> 05:34.125
and get some fixings
for Guy's double-fried taquitos.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.294
And I'm gonna go now.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.046
Gah, get out!

05:38.046 --> 05:40.257
- He's already gone.
- (sighs)

05:40.257 --> 05:43.134
Okay, look, I'm--
I'm not gonna say

05:43.134 --> 05:45.178
that I'm glad
you were fired, but...

05:45.178 --> 05:48.348
Yeah, I'm not gonna say
I'm glad I got fired, either.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.017
That was really bad.
But this is a silver lining.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.812
I'm just really happy you said
you'd go on a date with me.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.605
Come on,
did you think I wouldn't?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.191
I didn't want you to think I was
just gassing you up at work

05:58.191 --> 06:01.528
because I was into you,
because that's not the truth.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.405
I think you're
a really incredible writer.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.656
You could have told me

06:04.656 --> 06:05.699
that you were just doing
all of that

06:05.699 --> 06:06.908
'cause you thought I was hot.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.451
I think I might have
actually preferred it.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.537
You are hot, that's fact.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.040
But... you are also
a very gifted writer.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.167
- Okay, stop.
- You are.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.669
Why-why can't you take
a compliment?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.629
Sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.465
Thank you for the compliment,
I really enjoyed it.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.176
All right, that was worse
than the first time.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.720
- (laughs)
- I hated that even more.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.264
I used to be just like you.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.765
I grew up poor in Queens

06:30.765 --> 06:32.851
and I never thought I should be
invited to the party.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.186
But truly,
there is no invitation.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.479
No one invited me
to go to college.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.814
I was the first
in my family to do it.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.442
I studied so hard, I didn't
get laid for four years.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.568
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.612
- That's impressive.
- Thank you.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.405
Did you see what I did there?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.948
- Yes, you sincerely
took the compliment.
- You complimented me.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.617
I took it, and it--
you felt good.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.577
- It was nice, yeah.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.621

07:02.464 --> 07:04.382

07:04.382 --> 07:06.801

you were si--

07:06.801 --> 07:08.637
We didn't have to go out
if you're sick.

07:08.637 --> 07:09.971
- I'm not. I'm not.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.431

07:17.896 --> 07:19.939
you know what I mean?
It's like, you get the thing,

07:19.939 --> 07:21.650
and then you take it for two
days, and then you feel better,

07:21.650 --> 07:22.859
and then they just sit
in your drawer forever.

07:22.859 --> 07:23.777
And so, I'm just trying
this new thing where I--

07:23.777 --> 07:25.445

So, um, what do you like to do?</i>

08:26.589 --> 08:29.718
Oh, I like to lay in bed
a lot and watch TV,

08:29.718 --> 08:31.386
and sometimes eat in bed

08:31.386 --> 08:33.430
if it's not, like,
a red sauce or anything.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.806
That's so funny.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.516
Actually, I've been eating
in bed a lot, too.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.144
Mainly cereal,
but I'm also eating cereal

08:39.144 --> 08:40.687
for most meals, so it's a lot.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.814
My friends are like,
"You're so depressed."

08:42.814 --> 08:44.691
And I'm like, what if
I just enjoy the things

08:44.691 --> 08:46.860
that happen to be
symptoms of depression?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.945
Yeah, no, I totally get that.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.699
Though, to be fair,
I have been pretty depressed.

08:52.699 --> 08:56.202
Does it count as depression
if we do it together?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.788
I'm not sure.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.082
Let's find out?

- Yeah.

No, no, we're literally
just gonna get cereal.

and get another one.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.237
Another?
Is that, is that, like, okay?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.448
Oh, yeah. No, I'm just
practicing moderation.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.908

- Yeah.

for one more?

10:00.391 --> 10:01.768
Okay.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.314
Hey, buddy,
you ready for the check?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.732
Can I get another beer?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.609

I wanted to tell you that, um...

10:52.819 --> 10:54.988
My friend got dumped tonight.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.657
Oh.
I'm sorry, that's terrible.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
Yeah, she's actually
really upset,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.828
and, like,
she lives pretty close,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.246

I should go check in on her

she's okay, you know.

Well, I care that
you got healthy

18:53.466 --> 18:55.551
and you stopped drinking, but...

18:56.802 --> 18:59.388
I like you, and I don't think
you're too much.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.099
And we can still
smoke weed, right?

19:02.099 --> 19:05.436
No, I-- I don't do that either, actually.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.731
That's a bit of a bummer,
but we'll get past that, right?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.609
Can you sit down?

19:13.027 --> 19:15.154
Okay.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.492
You all right?

19:21.035 --> 19:25.164
So, you just want to, like,
keep seeing each other?

19:26.207 --> 19:27.541
Yeah.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.795
(chuckles)

19:30.795 --> 19:32.922
You're the weirdest person
I've ever met.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.965
Thank you.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.801
Good job
taking a compliment.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.219
You taught me well.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.267
Yes!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.519
(both laughing)

19:46.519 --> 19:49.188
- That was dope!
- (laughing)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.365
(sighs)

20:04.412 --> 20:06.622
I can't do it. I can't.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.873
I can't do it.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.167
- You can.
- Oh, damn it.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.044
This is how
you're gonna move on.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.171
I want to wipe my ass with this.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.506
I know.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.634
I want to just grab it,

20:18.634 --> 20:21.512
I want to go back to front,
and then piss on it.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.305
I know.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.807
You have to put it on.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.061
(sighing): Oh, man.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.147
(groans)

20:31.147 --> 20:32.648
Oh, my God.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.900
Oh, God.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.278
That just feels wrong.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.280
(Nathaniel sighs)

20:39.280 --> 20:40.990
You look... foxy.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.618
I know you're lying.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.995
I am.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.164
- But thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.416
