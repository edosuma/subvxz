WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.935
No, seriously,
I think

00:02.936 --> 00:05.037
I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

00:05.038 --> 00:08.741
The capybara is the largest
member of the rodent family.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.177
What does that have to do
with me and women?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.678
Nothing.
It was a desperate attempt

00:12.679 --> 00:15.581
to introduce an alternate topic
of conversation.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.751
My problem is,
I don't project confidence.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.654
So I decided that
the next time I meet a woman

00:21.655 --> 00:23.723
I think is attractive,
rather than holding back

00:23.724 --> 00:25.524
and being cautious,
I'm going to assume

00:25.525 --> 00:27.059
the mantle of self-assurance.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.794
Oh, yeah?
What's that look like?

00:32.399 --> 00:34.633
Hi.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.369
I'm Leonard.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.271
And you are beautiful.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.608
You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.677
I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

00:44.678 --> 00:48.781
show you a night
you will never forget.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.616
Where are we going?

00:55.355 --> 00:56.489
Good news.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.324
I made it
onto the team

00:58.325 --> 00:59.525
for the new Defense Department

00:59.526 --> 01:01.277
laser-equipped
surveillance satellite.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.162
Excuse me.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.063
If we're changing topics,
I believe I have first dibs

01:05.065 --> 01:09.135
with capybara, a rodent
the size of a baby hippo.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.454
Congratulations,
Howard.

01:11.455 --> 01:12.705
Thanks.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.907
Listen, I have to get
a security clearance,

01:14.908 --> 01:17.810
so you guys might be
hearing from the FBI.

01:17.811 --> 01:18.878
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:18.879 --> 01:20.579
I don't want to speak
to the FBI.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.881
Why not?

01:21.882 --> 01:24.717
I'm brown and I talk funny.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.102
They're just doing
a background check on me.

01:27.103 --> 01:28.487
It doesn't matter;
they'll find a reason

01:28.488 --> 01:30.890
to give me a one-way ticket
back to Gandhi-ville.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.091
By the way,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.126
when I say that,
it's not offensive.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.195
Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.496
You're here legally.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.131
Nobody cares.
Do you know how long it's been

01:39.132 --> 01:40.466
since I got through
airport security

01:40.467 --> 01:42.668
without being given
a colonoscopy?

01:43.703 --> 01:45.104
You know, I
try very hard

01:45.105 --> 01:47.807
to make our lunch hours
educational and informative,

01:47.808 --> 01:50.643
but your insistence on
talking about your own lives

01:50.644 --> 01:52.478
stymies me at
every turn.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.781
Fine, Sheldon, tell us
about your giant rodents.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.616
1No, you squandered
your time with me,

01:57.617 --> 01:59.468
and the moment
has now passed.

01:59.469 --> 02:01.170
Feast on your disappointment,

02:01.171 --> 02:03.722
much as the capybara
feasts on its own waste.

02:43.909 --> 02:44.959
Coming.

02:49.799 --> 02:51.599
Dr. Koothrappali?

02:53.719 --> 02:56.304
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

02:56.305 --> 02:57.472
May I come in?

02:59.258 --> 03:03.178
I'd like to talk to you
about Howard Wolowitz.

03:03.179 --> 03:04.679
Oh, thank you.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.764
All right.

03:05.765 --> 03:08.683
Well, how long
have you known Mr. Wolowitz?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.322 --> 03:32.240
Rum cake?

03:32.241 --> 03:33.407
No, thanks.

03:33.408 --> 03:35.677
Now, about Mr.
Wolowitz...

03:35.678 --> 03:36.945
Seven years.

03:36.946 --> 03:39.013
I see.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.851
I'm in this country
legally, you know.

03:42.852 --> 03:45.553
I'm sure you are.

03:45.554 --> 03:49.190
Now, to your knowledge, has Mr.
Wolowitz ever committed a crime?

03:49.191 --> 03:50.424
Of course not.

03:50.425 --> 03:51.776
I'm here on an H-1B visa,

03:51.777 --> 03:53.862
which means I can't be
associated in any way

03:53.863 --> 03:55.396
with crime
or criminal activity.

03:55.397 --> 03:56.831
And I'm not.

03:56.832 --> 03:58.233
Good.

03:58.234 --> 03:59.767
To your knowledge,
does Mr. Wolowitz

03:59.768 --> 04:01.236
have any foreign
contacts?

04:01.237 --> 04:03.604
No, just me.

04:03.605 --> 04:05.206
Oh, there it is.

04:05.207 --> 04:07.158
Here comes a cavity search.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.993
Excuse me?

04:08.994 --> 04:10.745
Please don't send me back
to India; it's so crowded!

04:10.746 --> 04:13.781
It's like the whole country
is one endless Comic-Con,

04:13.782 --> 04:18.452
except everybody's wearing
the same costume: Indian Guy.

04:18.454 --> 04:20.672
Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not...
I love this country!

04:20.673 --> 04:23.124
The-the baseball,
the freedom,

04:23.125 --> 04:24.976
the rampant morbid obesity!

04:24.977 --> 04:27.145
From California
to the New York Island!

04:27.146 --> 04:28.313
I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!

04:40.109 --> 04:42.810
So, when Howard said the FBI
would be contacting me,

04:42.811 --> 04:44.879
I was expecting Mulder.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.981
Glad to see I got Scully.

04:48.050 --> 04:48.983
Who?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.718
Mulder and Scully.

04:51.253 --> 04:52.487
<i>X-Files.</i>

04:53.122 --> 04:54.656
"The truth is out there."

04:54.657 --> 04:55.723
Never mind.

04:55.724 --> 04:58.760
Uh, so, what would you
like to know?

04:58.761 --> 05:02.463
You work with Mr. Wolowitz here
at the university, correct?

05:02.464 --> 05:04.799
Yes. Of course, we're in
different departments.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.001
He's an engineer and I'm
an experimental physicist.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.469
You know, one
of those guys

05:08.470 --> 05:11.039
who examines the building blocks
of creation

05:11.040 --> 05:15.109
and says,
"Hello, maker of the universe.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.579
"I see what you did there.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.280
Good one."

05:19.281 --> 05:20.915
Right.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.183
Now, how would you characterize

05:22.184 --> 05:24.252
your relationship
with Mr. Wolowitz?

05:24.253 --> 05:26.387
Good.

05:26.388 --> 05:29.023
It's a good
relationship.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.227
Of course, most of my
relationships are good.

05:32.228 --> 05:35.396
Probably because
I exude confidence.

05:35.397 --> 05:37.765
People are drawn to that,
you know?

05:38.868 --> 05:41.436
Confidence, not exuding.

05:43.205 --> 05:46.090
Do you know of any groups
Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

05:46.091 --> 05:47.091
You are beautiful,

05:47.092 --> 05:49.110
you know that?

05:49.879 --> 05:53.781
You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

05:54.884 --> 05:58.019
I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

05:58.020 --> 06:01.322
show you a night
you will never forget.

06:01.323 --> 06:03.324
Sounds great.

06:03.325 --> 06:06.027
Really?

06:06.028 --> 06:07.278
Yeah.

06:07.279 --> 06:11.032
Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL
husband come with us?

06:11.033 --> 06:12.750
Is that...?

06:12.751 --> 06:15.570
Oh, my, I didn't see the ring
with my glasses off, so...

06:17.089 --> 06:18.790
Look at that,
I'm starting to exude.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.379
Want to get that?

06:24.380 --> 06:26.681
Not particularly.

06:26.682 --> 06:28.616
Could you get that?

06:28.617 --> 06:31.252
I suppose I could
if I were asked.

06:32.254 --> 06:34.222
Would you please get that?

06:34.223 --> 06:35.923
Of course.

06:37.693 --> 06:39.928
Why do you have to make things
so complicated?

06:41.931 --> 06:43.164
Dr. Cooper?

06:43.165 --> 06:44.098
Yes.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.900
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

06:48.604 --> 06:53.741
You <i>say</i> you're Special
Agent Page, FBI.

06:53.742 --> 06:54.676
Here's my I.D.

06:54.677 --> 06:56.628
And here is

06:56.629 --> 07:01.015
my Justice League
membership card.

07:02.484 --> 07:04.752
But that doesn't
prove I know Batman.

07:04.753 --> 07:09.524
I just want to ask you a few
questions about Howard Wolowitz.

07:09.525 --> 07:11.625
Oh. All right.

07:11.626 --> 07:14.395
I doubt anyone
would risk

07:14.396 --> 07:17.015
the stiff penalties for
impersonating a federal officer

07:17.016 --> 07:19.434
just to ask questions about
a minor league engineer

07:19.435 --> 07:21.235
with an unresolved
Oedipal complex.

07:23.022 --> 07:24.038
Thank you.

07:24.039 --> 07:27.442
For the record,
I truly support the FBI

07:27.443 --> 07:29.277
in the mission
which is expressed

07:29.278 --> 07:30.545
through their motto...?

07:30.546 --> 07:33.214
Fidelity, bravery, integrity.

07:33.215 --> 07:35.700
Correct. Now to business.

07:35.701 --> 07:40.221
18 years ago, I sent
the FBI Crime Lab samples

07:40.222 --> 07:42.824
from a bag of excrement
that had been lit on fire

07:42.825 --> 07:44.158
on my front porch...

07:45.894 --> 07:49.597
...for fingerprinting
and DNA analysis.

07:49.598 --> 07:51.599
Why haven't I heard back yet?

07:51.600 --> 07:56.170
Well, the FBI Crime Lab
does have a lot on its plate.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.106
That's of little comfort
to a nation

07:58.107 --> 08:01.409
attempting to scrape
burning feces off its shoes.

08:01.410 --> 08:04.579
Would you mind if we talked
about Mr. Wolowitz now?

08:04.580 --> 08:06.948
A little, but go on.

08:06.949 --> 08:08.066
Thank you.

08:08.067 --> 08:11.319
Would you characterize him
as responsible?

08:11.320 --> 08:15.223
I'm going to answer that
with a visual aid.

08:16.859 --> 08:18.993
This is my nine-disc complete

08:18.994 --> 08:21.662
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy
Blu-ray set.

08:21.663 --> 08:23.798
Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

08:23.799 --> 08:26.718
damaged plastic retention
hub number three...

08:31.757 --> 08:34.592
...and then returned it to me,
hoping I wouldn't notice.

08:34.592 --> 08:38.346
Would you characterize that
as responsible?

08:38.347 --> 08:41.215
That's really not the sort of
thing we're interested in.

08:41.216 --> 08:44.519
You heard me say
Blu-ray, right?

08:44.520 --> 08:46.054
I did.

08:46.055 --> 08:47.255
Very well.

08:47.256 --> 08:48.556
Would you be interested

08:48.557 --> 08:51.893
in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz
once snuck onto

08:51.894 --> 08:54.896
my World of Warcraft account
and changed the name

08:54.897 --> 08:59.767
of a certain level-80 warlock
from Sheldor to Smeldor?

08:59.768 --> 09:01.335
I'm afraid not.

09:01.336 --> 09:03.538
Is there anything else?

09:03.539 --> 09:04.539
"Is there anything else?"

09:04.540 --> 09:05.706
Where would you like to start?

09:05.707 --> 09:07.442
He refuses to pay fines

09:07.443 --> 09:09.377
when he's overdue
with books I lend him.

09:09.378 --> 09:12.413
He crashed the Mars Rover while
attempting to impress a woman.

09:12.414 --> 09:13.948
He recommended that I go see

09:13.949 --> 09:16.551
the third <i>Matrix</i> movie
because it was, and I quote,

09:16.552 --> 09:19.971
"just as good
as the first one."

09:19.972 --> 09:23.424
If that's not irresponsible,
I don't know what is.

09:23.425 --> 09:25.359
The Mars Rover?

09:31.300 --> 09:32.867
Did I say Mars Rover?

09:32.868 --> 09:33.868
You did.

09:33.869 --> 09:36.204
That was actually
a poorly chosen example,

09:36.205 --> 09:38.940
as it had nothing
to do with me.

09:38.941 --> 09:41.609
Yes, well, let's talk
about it anyway.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.111
I don't want to.

09:43.946 --> 09:45.313
Not that my disinclination

09:45.314 --> 09:47.348
to discuss the topic
should be interpreted as

09:47.349 --> 09:49.917
evidence of Howard Wolowitz's
culpability in the destruction

09:49.918 --> 09:52.953
of government property
worth millions of dollars.

09:52.954 --> 09:54.222
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

09:54.223 --> 09:55.823
I think I have all I need.

09:55.824 --> 09:57.592
Oh, good.

09:57.593 --> 09:59.310
I was afraid you were
going to fixate

09:59.311 --> 10:00.928
on that Mars Rover incident.

10:07.319 --> 10:08.803
Hey, buddies.

10:08.804 --> 10:10.021
Guess who didn't get
security clearance

10:10.022 --> 10:11.639
to work on
the giant space laser?

10:11.640 --> 10:13.441
What happened?

10:13.442 --> 10:15.610
Apparently, the background
interviews didn't go well.

10:15.611 --> 10:16.944
You guys wouldn't
know anything

10:16.945 --> 10:18.579
about that, would you?

10:20.315 --> 10:22.049
Well, actually,
I may have gotten

10:22.050 --> 10:24.252
a little tipsy
when I talked to her.

10:24.953 --> 10:25.987
And I may have

10:25.988 --> 10:27.755
hit on her a little bit.

10:27.756 --> 10:31.292
I may have thrown up
rum cake on her shoes.

10:31.293 --> 10:33.094
I see.

10:33.095 --> 10:35.963
Well, it's good to know, when
I need you guys, I can always

10:35.964 --> 10:38.866
count on you to step up
and ruin everything.

10:41.436 --> 10:43.104
I feel awful.

10:43.105 --> 10:44.004
Ah, me, too.

10:44.005 --> 10:45.039
To tell you the truth,

10:45.040 --> 10:46.440
I thought if anyone was going to

10:46.441 --> 10:47.975
screw things up for Howard,
it'd be Sheldon.

10:47.976 --> 10:52.813
Well, your expectations
have been subverted.

10:52.814 --> 10:54.515
Aha.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.800
What are you doing up?

11:03.801 --> 11:05.968
Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.353
Really?

11:07.354 --> 11:09.856
Maybe sleep has met you before.

11:09.857 --> 11:11.407
Mockery?

11:11.408 --> 11:13.226
That's all you have to offer?

11:13.227 --> 11:14.544
I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

11:14.545 --> 11:15.945
Who knows?

11:15.946 --> 11:18.347
I haven't watched
any scary movies recently.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.017
I'm no longer obsessing
over why the predicted mass

11:21.018 --> 11:22.985
of the quantum vacuum
has little effect

11:22.986 --> 11:25.021
on the expansion
of the universe.

11:25.022 --> 11:28.741
And it's been weeks since I took
that accidental sip of Red Bull.

11:28.742 --> 11:32.061
Did something happen today
that's bothering you?

11:32.062 --> 11:33.396
Well, I did mention

11:33.397 --> 11:36.199
the Mars Rover incident
to that FBI agent

11:36.200 --> 11:38.935
and probably cost Howard
his security clearance.

11:38.936 --> 11:42.038
What?
But why should that keep me up?

11:42.039 --> 11:44.173
Because you feel guilty?

11:44.174 --> 11:46.008
Interesting.

11:46.009 --> 11:50.646
So you're saying my insomnia is
caused by a guilty conscience.

11:50.647 --> 11:52.348
Actually,
you don't have insomnia.

11:52.349 --> 11:53.716
You're sleeping now.

11:53.717 --> 11:54.851
Excuse me?

11:54.852 --> 11:56.953
You're having
a guilt-ridden dream.

11:56.954 --> 11:59.622
Do you have any evidence
to support that hypothesis?

11:59.623 --> 12:02.358
How about that Gorn
sitting on the couch?

12:06.113 --> 12:08.865
That seems fairly conclusive.

12:08.866 --> 12:12.335
No, Gorn, no.

12:12.336 --> 12:15.154
That's where I sit.

12:16.273 --> 12:19.575
Thank you for agreeing
to see me, Agent Page.

12:19.576 --> 12:23.579
Thank <i>you</i> for filing a complaint
with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.598
I understand
you want to recant

12:25.599 --> 12:28.117
your statement
about Howard Wolowitz.

12:28.118 --> 12:30.620
Yes.
Was your statement untrue?

12:30.621 --> 12:32.488
No.

12:32.489 --> 12:35.691
Then I'm afraid
you can't withdraw it.

12:35.692 --> 12:40.012
I'm sorry. I don't recall
you saying "no backsies."

12:40.898 --> 12:42.698
Is there anything else?

12:42.699 --> 12:45.401
Yes. I'd like to offer
a laudatory statement

12:45.402 --> 12:47.503
about Howard's many excellent
qualities that I believe

12:47.504 --> 12:49.272
will tip the scales
back in his favor.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.074
"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.111
"H is for honesty,
of which he has much.

12:55.112 --> 12:56.646
"O's for outstanding,

12:56.647 --> 12:58.481
"which he is such.

12:58.482 --> 13:01.083
"W's for witty,
he's quick with a joke.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.336
A's for artistic, his ability...
" I'm sorry.

13:03.337 --> 13:06.355
Dr. Cooper, this matter
is already closed.

13:06.356 --> 13:09.525
But I still have
"rd Joel Wolowitz" left to go.

13:09.526 --> 13:10.876
It's closed.

13:12.846 --> 13:14.430
I don't understand
why you people

13:14.431 --> 13:16.032
are picking on my
friend, Howard,

13:16.033 --> 13:18.267
when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.

13:18.268 --> 13:20.369
For instance,
when I first met Leonard,

13:20.370 --> 13:22.204
he was on the verge
of giving away

13:22.205 --> 13:24.173
rocket secrets
to a North Korean spy,

13:24.174 --> 13:27.076
and not one agent
ever investigated that.

13:27.911 --> 13:29.578
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

13:30.447 --> 13:32.448
No, it's a different Leonard.

13:32.449 --> 13:33.699
He's...

13:33.700 --> 13:34.867
Chinese, red hair, six fingers.

13:34.868 --> 13:36.285
Good-bye.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.957
Raj.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.591
Have you seen Howard?

13:42.592 --> 13:44.627
I think he's eating lunch.

13:44.628 --> 13:47.129
Uh, Sheldon, I want you
to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson

13:47.130 --> 13:49.198
from the Hayden Planetarium
in New York.

13:49.199 --> 13:51.233
I'm quite familiar
with Dr. Tyson.

13:51.234 --> 13:53.803
He's responsible
for the demotion of Pluto

13:53.804 --> 13:55.604
from planetary status.

13:55.605 --> 13:57.273
I liked Pluto.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.876
Ergo I do not like you.

14:00.877 --> 14:02.411
But I actually
didn't demote Pluto.

14:02.412 --> 14:03.579
That was a vote

14:03.580 --> 14:05.214
of the International
Astronomical Union.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.383
If "ifs" and "buts"
were candy and nuts,

14:07.384 --> 14:09.218
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.438
Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.258
Is that the guy you
were telling me about?

14:16.259 --> 14:18.560
Oh, yeah.

14:19.613 --> 14:21.497
Howard.

14:21.498 --> 14:23.065
The person at fault for you

14:23.066 --> 14:25.334
not getting
a security clearance is me.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.069
You?

14:27.070 --> 14:29.338
Yes, but before you get upset,
I want you to know

14:29.339 --> 14:32.141
I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.

14:32.142 --> 14:33.976
And they were okay with that?

14:33.977 --> 14:36.912
No. If anything,
I made it worse.

14:38.048 --> 14:40.816
In any case, I have
been riddled with guilt,

14:40.817 --> 14:43.419
which is causing
Gorn-infested REM sleep.

14:43.420 --> 14:47.156
So, I'm here now
to say I'm sorry.

14:47.157 --> 14:48.657
Are you kidding me?

14:48.658 --> 14:51.327
You've set my career back
at least two years,

14:51.328 --> 14:53.763
and you think you can make it
right with "I'm sorry"?

14:53.764 --> 14:55.231
Yes.

14:56.366 --> 14:57.700
I followed the social protocol.

14:57.701 --> 15:00.636
I attempted to right the wrong,
and when I failed to do so,

15:00.637 --> 15:02.238
I delivered a heartfelt apology.

15:02.239 --> 15:03.439
Now you say,

15:03.440 --> 15:04.740
"Apology accepted,"

15:04.741 --> 15:08.377
and I will offer you
a one-time-only high five.

15:09.663 --> 15:11.714
Your apology is not accepted.

15:11.715 --> 15:12.832
You're tricking me.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.050
It really is, isn't it?

15:14.051 --> 15:16.385
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

15:18.688 --> 15:21.157
Dr. Cooper, I just
wanted you to know

15:21.158 --> 15:24.060
I'm sorry for the role I
played in the Pluto matter.

15:24.061 --> 15:25.761
Oh, shut up.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.101
Sheldon?

15:32.102 --> 15:34.136
Hello.

15:34.137 --> 15:35.137
What are you doing here?

15:35.138 --> 15:37.540
I have troubles, Penny.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.141
I've come to pour them out

15:39.142 --> 15:41.677
to the sympathetic ear
of the local barkeep.

15:41.678 --> 15:43.946
You know, they have
a really nice bar

15:43.947 --> 15:45.815
over at the Olive Garden.

15:45.816 --> 15:47.950
I don't like the Olive Garden.

15:47.951 --> 15:50.386
They treat me like family.

15:52.022 --> 15:54.123
Okay, Sheldon.
What can I get you?

15:54.124 --> 15:55.391
Alcohol.

15:55.392 --> 15:57.693
Could you be
a little more specific?

15:57.694 --> 15:59.361
Ethyl alcohol.

15:59.362 --> 16:01.564
40 milliliters.

16:01.565 --> 16:03.966
I'm sorry, honey.
I don't know milliliters.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.735
Ah. Blame President James
"Jimmy" Carter.

16:06.736 --> 16:09.872
He started America on a path
to the metric system

16:09.873 --> 16:11.574
but then just gave up.

16:11.575 --> 16:14.643
He wonders why he
was a one-term president.

16:14.644 --> 16:17.179
Would you say that's
about 40 milliliters?

16:17.180 --> 16:19.415
More or less.
Great.

16:20.851 --> 16:22.518
Now, where were we?

16:22.519 --> 16:25.621
I believe you were about
to ask me to choose a cocktail.

16:25.622 --> 16:28.991
Fortunately, thanks
to computer-savvy alcoholics,

16:28.992 --> 16:31.293
there's an app for that.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.561
Let's see.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.930
Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

16:34.931 --> 16:37.466
Sex on the Beach.
I hardly think so.

16:38.468 --> 16:39.802
Rob Roy,

16:39.803 --> 16:41.570
Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

16:41.571 --> 16:43.205
Ooh!

16:43.206 --> 16:45.741
I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

16:45.742 --> 16:46.976
A what?
You'll need pitted,

16:46.977 --> 16:49.745
brandied cherries, gin,
rosewater,

16:49.746 --> 16:53.215
Angostura bitters
and overproofed rum.

16:53.216 --> 16:55.317
Now, first, dust
the cherries with sugar,

16:55.318 --> 16:58.254
then spray them with a mixture
of rum and bitters.

16:58.255 --> 16:59.788
Then ignite the rum,
caramel...

16:59.789 --> 17:02.458
Here you go-- one
Rosewater Ricky.

17:02.459 --> 17:04.160
That's not how it looks
in the picture.

17:04.161 --> 17:06.962
Oh, yeah, you know, every
bartender makes it differently.

17:06.963 --> 17:08.531
Why don't you
give it a try.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.499
All right.

17:12.085 --> 17:14.537
To the metric system.

17:24.981 --> 17:27.516
I can't taste the cherries.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.921
All right.
Sheldon, what's on your mind?

17:31.922 --> 17:35.758
I wronged Howard,
and he won't accept my apology.

17:35.759 --> 17:36.926
Oh, right, that.

17:36.927 --> 17:39.094
Yes, Leonard told me.
Sorry, honey.

17:39.095 --> 17:42.264
Penny, you face failure
on a daily basis.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.434
How do you cope?

17:45.435 --> 17:47.536
I drink.

17:48.605 --> 17:50.956
To drinking.

17:53.777 --> 17:56.111
Nope.

17:58.915 --> 18:00.382
Oh, if only there were some way

18:00.383 --> 18:02.184
to force Howard
to accept my apology

18:02.185 --> 18:05.254
so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

18:05.255 --> 18:06.855
You know, sometimes
stuff just happens,

18:06.856 --> 18:08.591
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

18:08.592 --> 18:09.892
For example, Lisa Peterson

18:09.893 --> 18:11.727
hasn't talked to me
since the 11th grade,

18:11.728 --> 18:13.729
because no matter how
much you apologize,

18:13.730 --> 18:17.399
you can't go back and
un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

18:18.235 --> 18:19.635
I see.

18:19.636 --> 18:22.805
You're saying I'm facing
Starfleet Academy's

18:22.806 --> 18:26.175
unwinnable command scenario:
the Kobayashi Maru.

18:26.176 --> 18:27.343
Exactly.

18:27.344 --> 18:28.611
Sometimes you can't win.

18:28.612 --> 18:31.113
Captain Kirk won.

18:31.948 --> 18:34.483
Kirk cheated.

18:35.318 --> 18:37.586
Impressive that you know that.

18:38.488 --> 18:39.722
It's hard to believe

18:39.723 --> 18:41.523
I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

18:41.524 --> 18:43.325
Right there with you.

18:44.527 --> 18:50.366
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.468
That's it.
What?

18:52.469 --> 18:54.870
I'll reprogram Howard.
What...?

18:54.871 --> 18:57.806
Sheldon, you can't
reprogram people.

18:57.807 --> 19:00.776
No, <i>you</i> can't reprogram people.

19:01.711 --> 19:04.280
To James Tiberius Kirk.

19:14.274 --> 19:15.958
Hello, all.

19:15.959 --> 19:18.160
- Hello.
- Hey.

19:18.161 --> 19:21.063
Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

19:21.064 --> 19:22.531
Not really.

19:22.532 --> 19:24.400
Yes, you are.

19:24.401 --> 19:26.969
I'm using
neurolinguistic programming

19:26.970 --> 19:29.338
to modify your thought patterns.

19:29.339 --> 19:31.073
Oh.

19:31.074 --> 19:33.142
Go away, Sheldon.

19:33.143 --> 19:36.428
There's a $9.95 e-book
down the drain.

19:36.429 --> 19:37.563
What's in the bag?

19:37.564 --> 19:38.731
It's for Howard.

19:38.732 --> 19:41.900
Oh. Sheldon, you can't
fix this with gifts.

19:41.901 --> 19:43.068
Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

19:43.069 --> 19:45.287
and whether you
forgive me or not,

19:45.288 --> 19:47.323
I want you to
have this.

19:49.109 --> 19:50.893
You're giving me
a couch cushion?

19:50.894 --> 19:52.261
No.

19:52.262 --> 19:54.063
The cushion is merely symbolic.

19:54.064 --> 19:57.099
I'm giving you my spot
on the couch.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.003
But you love that spot.

20:01.004 --> 20:03.539
No. I love my mother.

20:03.540 --> 20:07.576
My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

20:08.645 --> 20:10.646
It is the singular location
in space

20:10.647 --> 20:13.582
around which revolves
my entire universe.

20:14.451 --> 20:16.251
And now it's yours.

20:17.387 --> 20:20.189
Oh, my God, dude.
Now you have to forgive him.

20:21.024 --> 20:22.725
All right.

20:22.726 --> 20:24.860
Apology accepted.

20:24.861 --> 20:26.862
High five.

20:26.863 --> 20:28.864
Not too hard.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.800
Thank you.

20:31.801 --> 20:35.454
I haven't cried like this
since <i>Toy Story 3.</i>

20:44.974 --> 20:46.141
I got to tell you,

20:46.142 --> 20:48.510
Sheldon, I understand why
you chose this spot.

20:48.511 --> 20:51.396
I mean, the temperature is
good, but there's no draft.

20:51.397 --> 20:53.899
I can see the television,
but I can still talk to...

20:53.900 --> 20:56.585
