My dad had to run a small shop

How much is that business

05:04.300 --> 05:04.300
Twenty or thirty thousand

05:05.933 --> 05:05.933
Don't waste my time on that

05:07.366 --> 05:09.401
lf you don't repay the money, you're done

Don't beat my unc_

05:22.300 --> 05:22.300
Don't beat Xiao Xi

05:24.133 --> 05:28.403
Niu Juncheng is the one who listens
to me the most in this town

05:28.933 --> 05:28.933
Hey, they're iust kids

05:31.066 --> 05:31.066

06:01.333 --> 06:03.468

06:11.766 --> 06:11.766
ln the summer of 200O

most of the freshmen

06:19.000 --> 06:20.801
rushing into Beiiing, Shanghai and Guangzhou

have enough money to live

06:37.066 --> 06:38.734

16:44.799 --> 16:44.799
not to verify the past

16:47.299 --> 16:49.602
but to start the next iourney

16:50.200 --> 16:51.734
Class begin

Yes

17:00.433 --> 17:02.368
Why haven't you rung the class bell?

17:08.333 --> 17:09.599
That's enough

17:11.733 --> 17:11.733
Dowdy girl

17:13.165 --> 17:14.700
a fake student

17:16.933 --> 17:20.236
You want to be my assisstant on4r by this resume?

17:20.366 --> 17:20.366
You are right

17:21.766 --> 17:21.766

17:24.465 --> 17:27.301
You must re4r on _gal buiness

17:29.133 --> 17:29.133
Assistant

17:30.299 --> 17:32.368
_uld you p_ase cbse the door from the outside?

17:33.099 --> 17:34.434
Yes

17:36.933 --> 17:39.669
lf the business col_ge is a society

17:40.099 --> 17:43.470
Then eveyone here must be an expert

17:44.066 --> 17:44.066
lt's like an economy class passenger
mixed with first class

17:48.333 --> 17:48.333
But l've decided

17:49.433 --> 17:52.269
l'll definite4r take advantage of this

18:00.666 --> 18:02.200
C_an up

18:10.166 --> 18:10.166
Some of them are iust like stars

18:11.933 --> 18:14.368

18:14.400 --> 18:14.400
l wonder whether they come to study or play

18:17.266 --> 18:20.268
Someone is iust like Queen Elizabeth

18:21.099 --> 18:21.099
Have you seen anyone coming to class
with body guards?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.167
What?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.269
And also the professor Meng

18:31.033 --> 18:31.033
lt's iust so difficuft serving him

18:33.099 --> 18:33.099
lf it weren't for his pretty face

18:34.866 --> 18:36.534
l real4r couldn't bear it

18:37.366 --> 18:37.366
For a professor, handsome face is use_ss

18:40.033 --> 18:40.033
his know_dge is more important

18:42.099 --> 18:43.734
You don't get it

18:44.066 --> 18:44.066
For women

18:45.333 --> 18:45.333
Being handsome

18:46.333 --> 18:47.701
is enough

19:02.900 --> 19:02.900

l'll tell you something

19:15.166 --> 19:15.166
Since you came back from U.S.

19:17.133 --> 19:17.133
Your taste for man

19:18.400 --> 19:21.069
iust turned down terrib4r

20:04.099 --> 20:04.099
This is why you wanted to be my assistant

20:06.233 --> 20:07.867
Professor

20:11.266 --> 20:11.266
How much are they paying you?

20:12.799 --> 20:12.799
Who are you talking about?

20:14.066 --> 20:15.634
l've heard that in the market

20:15.866 --> 20:17.867
they offer RMB50,OOO to puchase my _cture notes

20:17.900 --> 20:17.900
How much can you get?

20:19.233 --> 20:19.233
No, no, it's not like that

20:21.133 --> 20:21.133
lt's me who wants to read these copies

20:23.299 --> 20:24.501
lt's true

20:24.799 --> 20:24.799
Actual4r,
l'm amays listening to your _ctures outside

20:27.200 --> 20:29.035
But l can't hear you c_ar4r

20:30.433 --> 20:33.135
A _opard can't change his spots

20:33.799 --> 20:35.268
You're fired

21:13.266 --> 21:14.767
Lu Zhenxi

21:15.799 --> 21:15.799
Are you crazy?

21:16.933 --> 21:18.734
You bok down on me like this

21:18.799 --> 21:20.801
Why did you give me this chance?

21:21.099 --> 21:24.069
That's because l can see ''hope'' in your eyes

21:24.133 --> 21:26.201
l wanted to give you a chance

21:26.766 --> 21:30.469
But you are out of control

21:30.799 --> 21:30.799
To be honest, the reason why l came here

21:32.066 --> 21:33.434
ls you

21:35.366 --> 21:38.769
Those who win over the Chinese entrepreneurs

21:39.266 --> 21:39.266
are those
who will be ab_ to conquer the business world

21:43.433 --> 21:45.768
The American Dream has passed

21:46.000 --> 21:49.069
Now it's time to live the Chinese Dream

21:49.900 --> 21:51.434
At that time

21:52.166 --> 21:54.201
You gave me a new dream

21:55.066 --> 21:56.700
ln order to achieve this dream

21:57.099 --> 21:59.135
l chose to come back to my county

21:59.366 --> 21:59.366
after coming here

22:00.866 --> 22:03.201
through my hard work

22:03.799 --> 22:05.334
l iust want to prove mysem

22:06.366 --> 22:08.267
and earn your respect

22:12.066 --> 22:13.367
P_ase

22:15.166 --> 22:17.101

22:24.000 --> 22:25.201
Remember

22:26.000 --> 22:26.000
lf you want to read my _cture notes

22:28.200 --> 22:30.368
must get my approval

23:11.400 --> 23:13.435
So what do you like to do?

23:13.799 --> 23:13.799
l like shopping

23:15.166 --> 23:16.700
What a good idea !

23:16.866 --> 23:16.866
Do you know that most brilliant ideas?

23:18.366 --> 23:18.366
normal4r come from

23:21.200 --> 23:21.200
founders' favorite things

23:22.799 --> 23:22.799
So where do you normal4r shop?

23:25.166 --> 23:25.166
lFC, Huaihai Rd, West Naniing Rd......

23:29.000 --> 23:29.000
Definite4r no discount items

23:31.066 --> 23:32.267
Enough

23:32.433 --> 23:35.035
Are you discussing or chatting?

23:35.066 --> 23:37.067
lt's better for you two to have a date

23:40.266 --> 23:40.266
And you

23:41.133 --> 23:41.133
Why are you lurking here?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.168
Just sit down and listen

23:47.766 --> 23:47.766
Who's that woman?

23:49.333 --> 23:51.802
she must have too much fil_r in her face

23:51.933 --> 23:54.168
Just Baidu it

23:58.099 --> 23:58.099
Vice president of Golden Star department stores

24:01.000 --> 24:04.169
She runs this fami4r business
together with her husband

24:04.866 --> 24:07.101
Oh, she married a big shot

24:07.200 --> 24:08.367
No wonder she is so arrogant

24:08.400 --> 24:08.400
No, not this time

24:10.166 --> 24:10.166
As a matter of fact, her husband is the lucky one

24:12.900 --> 24:12.900
to have such a good business woman like her

24:15.000 --> 24:15.000
lf there was no Wen Qing

24:16.299 --> 24:16.299
the company would have bust up three years ago

24:19.366 --> 24:21.134
lt's hard to believe......

24:24.900 --> 24:24.900
Peng Dahai

24:26.299 --> 24:30.671
Oh my god, final4r you have discovered

24:30.766 --> 24:30.766
Like you, l enioy shopping as well

24:33.033 --> 24:33.033
The most favorite thing is

24:35.000 --> 24:36.301
to pay for the bill

24:38.233 --> 24:40.168
What does it matter to me?

24:40.799 --> 24:42.101
l need more water

24:42.133 --> 24:42.133
There is no water in it

24:43.266 --> 24:44.800
_ntinue

24:48.066 --> 24:49.267
You......

24:50.099 --> 24:50.099
l've already prepared the _cture notes

24:52.000 --> 24:52.000
the office has been c_aned

24:53.000 --> 24:53.000

24:53.799 --> 24:55.735
Your Americano will be ready in a minute

24:56.033 --> 24:56.033
Professor

24:57.033 --> 24:57.033
l've got a great business idea here,
would you like to listen...

24:59.033 --> 25:00.234
Enough

25:01.799 --> 25:01.799
Can't you dress yoursem more proper4r?

25:03.866 --> 25:03.866
Assistant Lu

25:04.866 --> 25:07.535
Dressing up is a business strategy as well

25:14.500 --> 25:17.569
Your professor is real4r demanding a bt

25:18.733 --> 25:20.701
Even your dress code?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.101
Good morning, sir

25:36.933 --> 25:36.933
Does he have any special requirement of you?

25:39.266 --> 25:39.266
Yes

25:40.000 --> 25:40.000
What's that ?

25:40.799 --> 25:43.269
To submit new business idea within next week

25:45.866 --> 25:47.300
Wow! Scares me

25:51.799 --> 25:51.799
Juncheng

25:52.799 --> 25:52.799
Ah

25:53.133 --> 25:55.702
Do you think women are happy when shopping?

25:55.900 --> 25:55.900
Of course

25:56.799 --> 25:59.269
Women are born for shopping

26:00.266 --> 26:02.167
l don't think so

26:04.866 --> 26:04.866
As a matter of fact

26:06.000 --> 26:08.535
Women are even lazier than men

26:09.900 --> 26:12.569
Do you know what women thinking about ?

26:13.566 --> 26:13.566
iust buy it

26:14.066 --> 26:14.066
Wrong

26:15.099 --> 26:15.099
Buy eveything

26:16.033 --> 26:17.667
Total4r wrong

26:19.799 --> 26:21.201
Look over there

26:22.166 --> 26:22.166
What the hell

26:22.900 --> 26:22.900
Why is this discount on4r for a limited time ?

26:24.866 --> 26:26.801
There are too many peop_

26:27.799 --> 26:29.168
Look at that

26:31.733 --> 26:31.733
You think l'm fat, don't you?

26:32.933 --> 26:32.933
Bitch

26:33.866 --> 26:36.068
You think you will be young forever?

26:36.799 --> 26:38.168
That one

26:38.900 --> 26:41.502
That's annoying

26:41.933 --> 26:45.703
l was hoping to re_ase my pressure
through shopping

26:45.799 --> 26:48.769
l didn't expect it so tiring

26:49.033 --> 26:54.004
My feet hurt, they real4r hurt

26:57.700 --> 26:58.767
Look

26:59.433 --> 26:59.433
ln order to get the goods they bve

27:01.866 --> 27:01.866
They suffer sore feet

27:03.033 --> 27:03.033
ln order to get discounted goods

27:05.166 --> 27:05.166
They shop in crowds

27:06.166 --> 27:06.166
And they also have to
endure comments from the sa_smen

27:10.000 --> 27:13.069
You real4r think that women enioy shopping ?

27:13.133 --> 27:14.601
Don't be sil4r

27:16.933 --> 27:18.100
Think about it

27:18.733 --> 27:19.600
You could sit in your home

27:20.366 --> 27:20.366
Wearing paiamas and app4ring facial masks

27:22.533 --> 27:25.802
You could shop for all items exlusive4r
designed for women

27:26.066 --> 27:26.066
According to your own size, preferences and brands

27:29.366 --> 27:31.067
With sutab_ recommendations

27:31.099 --> 27:31.099
click, click!

27:32.000 --> 27:32.000
You click on the keyboard

27:33.433 --> 27:36.068
They will deliver it direct4r to your home

27:36.766 --> 27:41.070
Women should iust stay at home and enioy shopping

27:42.533 --> 27:44.368
That's my business idea

27:44.900 --> 27:44.900
So, exclusive4r for women ?

27:47.500 --> 27:48.567
Yes

27:48.900 --> 27:48.900
Chapter 4 section 2 of your _cture notes

27:50.733 --> 27:50.733
you mentioned product differentiation

27:52.000 --> 27:52.000
Nowadays,
there are websites selling all types of goods

27:56.133 --> 27:56.133
But, websites designed on4r for women

27:58.400 --> 28:01.569
are real4r rare, and it should be a great market

28:01.700 --> 28:01.700
shopping websites for women

28:03.500 --> 28:05.735
lt is not good enough to show differentiation

28:07.733 --> 28:09.534
How to establish suppliers and the consumer groups

28:09.799 --> 28:12.502
You haven't provided any solutions to
address the suppliers

28:13.700 --> 28:16.335
The purchasing system must be detai_d as well

28:17.033 --> 28:17.033
Strategy

28:17.866 --> 28:19.367
must be extended !

28:20.099 --> 28:21.734
Extend

28:24.433 --> 28:26.501
Redo it and show me again

28:27.099 --> 28:28.100
Thanks a bt, professor

You do have some business ta_nt

Thank you professor, thank you

28:37.799 --> 28:37.799

l real4r don't like this

28:44.733 --> 28:44.733
Professor

28:45.333 --> 28:46.434
So,

A shopping website on4r for women

30:23.799 --> 30:25.001
Professor Meng

30:25.200 --> 30:25.200
does the assistant need to
submit assignment as well ?

30:26.933 --> 30:26.933
Lu Zhenxi is the assistant for this course

30:28.900 --> 30:31.168
ln order to help me to col_ct the information

30:31.233 --> 30:32.500

31:00.266 --> 31:02.935
Therefore, at _ast in this business subiect

31:03.700 --> 31:04.734
The three of you

31:05.133 --> 31:06.367
are partners

31:06.799 --> 31:08.234
ls there a prob_m?

31:08.433 --> 31:09.734
No prob_m

31:11.266 --> 31:14.435
Fate is real4r amazing

31:14.900 --> 31:14.900
But it seems like we were not going to accept it

31:18.266 --> 31:18.266
You don't need to wory about this assignment

31:20.466 --> 31:20.466
My companymen will produce
a professional business plan

31:23.900 --> 31:23.900
ls that ok?

31:24.733 --> 31:24.733
lt sounds like you are not helping us

31:26.900 --> 31:26.900
it's more like you are stealing our strategy

31:28.766 --> 31:28.766
l didn't expect you to
care about this work that much

31:31.299 --> 31:31.299
Didn't you come here to find a boy friend ?

31:33.166 --> 31:33.166
lt's none of your business

31:34.466 --> 31:37.602
lsn't it normal for me to find a decent man
as l'm sing_, young and pretty?

31:38.133 --> 31:38.133
There is another thing

31:39.333 --> 31:39.333
The key point of this layout is

31:40.700 --> 31:40.700
how you feel about the brand

31:42.233 --> 31:42.233
Can you do that without me?

31:43.799 --> 31:46.202
As a resuft, you still come to me...

31:47.866 --> 31:47.866
l have a suggestion

31:49.500 --> 31:49.500
Professor Meng said

31:50.866 --> 31:54.102
we must put our ideas together to
form the final layout

31:54.133 --> 31:55.567
lf you two don't have sufficient time to do this

31:55.700 --> 31:56.467
l'll do it

31:56.700 --> 31:56.700
l have faith l can do it right

31:57.866 --> 32:00.134
l promise that l won't _t you down

32:00.700 --> 32:03.402
As bng as you pay me a litt_ service fee

32:08.799 --> 32:08.799
We could sign the contract first

32:10.166 --> 32:11.667
Payment can be finalized after comp_tion

32:13.166 --> 32:13.166
This Meng Xiaoiun

32:14.366 --> 32:16.301
is he nuts?

32:21.099 --> 32:24.369
You'd better think about it

32:24.700 --> 32:25.634
Bye

32:29.066 --> 32:29.066
Ha, my driver has arrived

32:30.233 --> 32:30.233
Here

32:30.700 --> 32:31.667

32:32.433 --> 32:34.434
This is Gu Qiaoyin in our class

32:49.233 --> 32:51.234
Miss Gu

32:51.799 --> 32:53.568
Miss Gu

32:53.799 --> 32:57.470
Miss Gu_

33:03.799 --> 33:03.799
Excuse me, what's the matter?

33:05.466 --> 33:06.733
Where are you going?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.435
Would you mind _tting me take you home?

33:10.400 --> 33:11.667
l don't think it's real4r necessay

33:11.766 --> 33:13.167
_me on

33:13.400 --> 33:15.502
Real4r, l mean it

33:17.066 --> 33:18.700
Ah, stop, stop

33:20.200 --> 33:21.668
Just stop here

33:22.099 --> 33:23.401
You don't want me to drive inside?

33:23.666 --> 33:26.602
No, l don't like gossip

33:27.033 --> 33:28.100
Bye

33:54.666 --> 33:56.567
A Cinderella

33:57.200 --> 33:58.634
lnteresting

34:08.132 --> 34:10.435
lt is time!

34:53.199 --> 34:55.201
Taxi Taxi!

35:08.199 --> 35:09.534
Are you singing with your _gs?

35:12.166 --> 35:12.166
What's wrong with my _gs?

35:13.233 --> 35:15.702
Are you going to the next bar?

35:16.099 --> 35:17.301
_me on

35:18.933 --> 35:18.933
Are you kidding me?

35:20.366 --> 35:23.202
How can l ride on this thing?

35:27.099 --> 35:29.101
Hey, careful

35:41.000 --> 35:42.167
Supper

35:49.099 --> 35:50.868
lt's too safty

35:53.033 --> 35:53.033
Don't complain if you can't cook

35:55.199 --> 35:57.468
Who brought you supper at such a late time?

35:57.866 --> 35:57.866
How was business today?

36:00.000 --> 36:00.000
Terrific

36:01.099 --> 36:01.099
Real4r?

36:01.933 --> 36:03.567
l haven't sold a sing_ thing

36:04.166 --> 36:05.400
Zero?

36:06.933 --> 36:08.501
How could it be?

36:08.900 --> 36:08.900
Even if l sell it on the street,
l could sell something......

36:11.933 --> 36:11.933
lt's better to quit this iob

36:13.933 --> 36:16.168
Go back and run MeiMeiWang

36:16.199 --> 36:16.199
You'd be the boss

36:17.633 --> 36:17.633
l'd be the bosslady

36:18.900 --> 36:21.535
You got too much musc_s to be a bosslady

36:39.166 --> 36:39.166
Since you don't want to listen to me

36:41.000 --> 36:42.401
Why are you still asking my advice?

36:43.300 --> 36:43.300
Whatever, l'm your ham student

36:46.300 --> 36:48.535
lf your student fai_d in business

36:48.933 --> 36:52.069
lt's your shame

36:52.099 --> 36:54.202
lnvestigation of the market
and the distribution network

36:54.233 --> 36:54.233
product supp4r network

36:55.800 --> 36:55.800
Are you ready for that?

36:57.099 --> 36:57.099
Iy-

36:57.266 --> 36:57.266
ln the online shopping market

36:59.066 --> 37:00.534
for those who already have the advantage

37:00.866 --> 37:02.500
How will you compete with them?

37:03.866 --> 37:03.866
Professor Meng

37:05.099 --> 37:06.167
But do you know that?

37:07.166 --> 37:07.166
_mprehensive4r understanding the demands of women

37:10.000 --> 37:10.000
Maximizing to meet their aspirations

37:12.366 --> 37:12.366
This is exact4r
the original intention of MeiMeiWang

37:14.266 --> 37:15.867
No

37:16.266 --> 37:16.266
lf you want success

37:17.933 --> 37:21.236
you must first manage to grab
Wen Qing and Gu Qiaoyin's minds

37:21.866 --> 37:21.866
You still don't understand

37:22.933 --> 37:24.434
the importance of partners

37:25.233 --> 37:27.802
But convincing thoes two

37:28.866 --> 37:30.601
is even harder than IPO

37:31.199 --> 37:33.201
Let me tell you something

37:33.900 --> 37:36.302
lf you couldn't even do this

37:37.400 --> 37:39.034
How can you make

37:39.133 --> 37:40.801
the shopping website for women?

37:44.066 --> 37:45.267
Yummy

37:51.900 --> 37:55.203
Good morning, Miss Gu

37:56.433 --> 37:58.201
l am iust here to meet my friend

37:58.233 --> 37:58.233
My driver is waiting

37:59.400 --> 37:59.400

38:02.233 --> 38:03.500
Damn it

38:05.366 --> 38:05.366
What are you doing, l'll yell

38:07.166 --> 38:07.166
Look at it

38:08.000 --> 38:08.000
Such beautiful _gs

38:08.900 --> 38:11.302
How can you walk on this kind of road?

38:13.300 --> 38:13.300
Check this out

38:14.400 --> 38:14.400
They say

38:15.433 --> 38:15.433
Men are women's

38:17.300 --> 38:17.300
soul mate

38:19.133 --> 38:19.133
or their

38:20.066 --> 38:20.066
harbors

38:21.433 --> 38:21.433
Honest4r

38:22.800 --> 38:24.768
That's all crap

38:26.000 --> 38:26.000
Men are intended to be

38:27.866 --> 38:27.866
WOMen'S

38:28.433 --> 38:28.433
bodyguards

38:29.400 --> 38:29.400
Drivers

38:30.333 --> 38:30.333
ATMs

38:31.866 --> 38:33.133
lsn't that right?

38:35.300 --> 38:37.201
l want to take my Cinderella

38:37.266 --> 38:37.266
and turn her into my real princess

38:39.066 --> 38:40.267
ls that ok?

38:49.166 --> 38:50.734
Classmates

38:50.800 --> 38:50.800
For the business observation class this week......

38:52.300 --> 38:56.137
We are visiting Wen Qing's Golden Star _mpany

38:56.766 --> 38:58.367

38:58.400 --> 38:58.400
Feel free to ask her.

39:00.166 --> 39:00.166
This way

39:01.000 --> 39:01.000

39:02.233 --> 39:03.467
This way, p_ase

39:05.800 --> 39:10.738

39:11.199 --> 39:15.704
That's why she is so successful,
what a wide network !

39:22.866 --> 39:24.067
Thank you

39:38.233 --> 39:41.302
l ate too much crayFish last night......

39:55.800 --> 39:59.303
Mom, keeping calling me dosen't help

39:59.333 --> 40:00.701
Gu Qiaoyin

40:01.000 --> 40:01.000
lt's pretty hard to pretend to
be a Harvard graduate

40:04.033 --> 40:04.033
Have you hooked up with any guy?

40:05.933 --> 40:05.933
Afthough there are many successful men

40:08.766 --> 40:14.238
lt is still extreme4r hard to
find a successful sing_

40:14.300 --> 40:14.300
Trust me, l'll definite4r pay father's debt

40:17.900 --> 40:17.900
Just wait for weafthy son-in-law to make you tea

40:22.366 --> 40:22.366
Ok, ok

40:23.166 --> 40:25.034

40:30.566 --> 40:30.566
You again?

40:32.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah..

40:33.233 --> 40:33.233
Don't wory, l don't know Sichuan dia_ct...

40:35.300 --> 40:38.269
l was talking to a friend

40:38.866 --> 40:40.801
Not your mom?

40:43.033 --> 40:43.033
You told me you couldn't understand

40:44.800 --> 40:44.800
On4r ham

40:46.166 --> 40:48.034
l dare to _ak this out

40:48.066 --> 40:50.234
You are dead

40:50.300 --> 40:53.803
My ex _ft me for another woman
to get a bright future

40:53.866 --> 40:53.866
l sold fake bags to make a living,
and l was even arrested by police

40:57.933 --> 40:59.601
We're even

41:01.166 --> 41:01.166
Why do we have to talk in here?

41:06.266 --> 41:06.266
Behave yoursem, can't you?
All of my classmates are here

41:09.900 --> 41:09.900
l'm doing it on purpose

41:11.866 --> 41:13.801
l am Zhiyun's true bve

41:13.866 --> 41:15.667
Eveyone in the company knows that

41:15.766 --> 41:18.668
l'm the person
who actual4r in charge of the company now

41:19.000 --> 41:20.768
Why do l have to listen to you?

41:20.800 --> 41:23.736
Do you know
why Zou Zhiyun keeps delaying our divorce?

41:23.766 --> 41:23.766
Because this company can't run without me

41:25.533 --> 41:25.533
He can't take that risk

41:28.033 --> 41:32.103
l suggest you take a cold shower and wake up

41:32.233 --> 41:32.233
The one who needs to wake up is you

41:35.033 --> 41:35.033
Do you have any idea
why Zhiyun chose me instead of you?

41:38.066 --> 41:38.066
lt's because you're neither
a good mother nor a good wife

41:43.900 --> 41:43.900
Woman like you

41:46.133 --> 41:48.668
is so easy for a man to get with money

41:48.900 --> 41:48.900
He will _ave you soon, and get a new one

41:50.900 --> 41:50.900
Because you're iust a mistress

41:52.566 --> 41:54.601
Don't you understand?

41:57.800 --> 41:57.800
Hey, why are you slapping her?!

41:59.066 --> 41:59.066
Who are you? This is not your business

42:01.766 --> 42:03.267
Get away !

42:08.099 --> 42:09.601
You hit me?

42:13.233 --> 42:14.634
You grab me?

42:15.266 --> 42:15.266
What are you doing?

42:16.466 --> 42:17.567
You _t go

42:18.066 --> 42:19.500
What are you doing?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.267
You _t go

42:24.133 --> 42:24.133
You _t go

42:25.099 --> 42:26.534
You _t go

42:26.800 --> 42:28.201
What are you doing?

42:29.033 --> 42:30.534
Someone once said

42:30.800 --> 42:34.803
Women's friendship is made by two ways

42:35.000 --> 42:35.000
First, exchanging each other's secret

42:37.933 --> 42:41.169
Second, finding a common enemy

42:43.933 --> 42:43.933
Cheers for our victoy

42:46.866 --> 42:50.769
Cheers for the funny truth of life

42:52.000 --> 42:52.000
Gu Qiaoyin

42:53.566 --> 42:53.566
You still haven't finished this glass

42:56.099 --> 42:56.099
P_ase drink with a litt_ sincerity

42:58.033 --> 43:01.503
This is cal_d sem-control
in order to keep this figure

43:02.933 --> 43:07.704
My dear, mom bve you

43:09.500 --> 43:11.768
What are you doing?

43:13.766 --> 43:13.766
But l iust want to ask

43:15.099 --> 43:15.099
Why do you still keep that bitch in your company?

43:17.933 --> 43:20.068
Why can't you fire her?

43:20.433 --> 43:20.433
He had another woman before Anqi

43:24.466 --> 43:26.701
We are on4r a coup_ under law

43:26.900 --> 43:29.035
Why don't you divorce him?

43:30.733 --> 43:32.668
l haven't figured it out how to tell my daughter

43:32.766 --> 43:32.766
After all, my daughter still needs a dad......

43:35.099 --> 43:37.235
A dad should behave like a dad

43:37.400 --> 43:37.400
Your feelings are illusions

43:39.066 --> 43:41.067
There is something you don't know

43:41.133 --> 43:44.135
He will use my daughter's custody to blackmail me

43:44.166 --> 43:46.034
He will take eveything away from me.

43:47.533 --> 43:47.533
even the position of the chairman...

43:49.400 --> 43:51.668
So in this case, you're a so-cal_d boss

43:51.800 --> 43:53.468
pretending a boss

43:55.766 --> 43:55.766
lt turns out that you two are iust like me

43:57.533 --> 43:59.167
We are all bsers......''

44:00.900 --> 44:00.900
Ok, l will announce that

44:03.866 --> 44:03.866

47:21.733 --> 47:25.703
Let's drink for Wen Qing's independent new life

47:25.800 --> 47:25.800
This is for miss Gu to find a reliab_ man

l'm your partner, NiuJuncheng

47:57.733 --> 47:57.733
Oh dear

47:58.266 --> 47:58.266
l didn't expect that
he would have such bve4r curls

48:02.900 --> 48:02.900
_me on, you have seen him

48:05.300 --> 48:06.534
Let's go

48:10.866 --> 48:13.335
We_ome to the MeiMeiWang

48:13.433 --> 48:13.433
Afthough our company is stilliust a small company

48:15.699 --> 48:15.699
with two second hand computers.

48:17.800 --> 48:17.800
But

48:18.366 --> 48:18.366
We have the best IT expert from Goog_ China.

48:21.199 --> 48:22.267
Of course

48:22.333 --> 48:22.333
Afthough
l'm still in the internship period , but...

48:23.800 --> 48:25.434
You don't have to go on

48:25.866 --> 48:25.866
Also there is an expert understanding the consumers

48:29.166 --> 48:29.166
lf you would ioin us

48:30.466 --> 48:30.466
That would be pe_ect

48:31.800 --> 48:35.670
Well, l need to evaluate
the possibility of the project

48:36.300 --> 48:38.135
Ok, l am in

48:38.199 --> 48:41.136
YES! Ha ha, we_ome

48:41.866 --> 48:43.300
Creativity

48:43.800 --> 48:43.800
Technobgy

48:44.433 --> 48:45.600
That's right

48:46.766 --> 48:48.701
Me of course, the fashion sense

48:51.400 --> 48:51.400
But it's tru4r a litt_ bit hard to deal with you

48:54.133 --> 48:54.133
After all...

48:55.433 --> 48:57.735
You don't have any actual power

48:57.866 --> 48:59.167
What do you mean?

49:02.233 --> 49:04.602
Old and wise

49:06.800 --> 49:06.800
Mature

49:07.866 --> 49:08.733
Wise

49:08.800 --> 49:08.800
the rich experience of life

49:10.366 --> 49:10.366
Yes it is, Wen Qing

49:11.866 --> 49:11.866
None of us have any work experience
in the big company

49:14.433 --> 49:14.433
So

49:15.266 --> 49:17.234
We do need you

49:20.800 --> 49:20.800
What happened?

49:22.266 --> 49:22.266
We haven't paid the e_ctricity bill

49:24.166 --> 49:24.166
Of course, it's not because we can't afford it

49:26.466 --> 49:29.302
We have p_nty of natural light today
thanks to the sun

49:29.699 --> 49:29.699
soon we will have investment

49:30.800 --> 49:30.800
Niu Juncheng, shut your mouth

49:32.466 --> 49:32.466
That's good

49:33.300 --> 49:35.502
We have something to do

49:36.699 --> 49:36.699
Talking about the investment at BBQ party?

49:39.300 --> 49:42.603
Won't it be too smoky to talk?

49:42.800 --> 49:42.800
Why not?

49:43.800 --> 49:43.800
Someone can even talk about
the investment whi_ hiking

49:46.366 --> 49:49.235
That's why this is cal_d a BBQ party

49:49.266 --> 49:51.234
l real4r hate the smell of the BBQ

49:52.300 --> 49:56.404
l'll kill them all with my beauty

49:58.433 --> 50:01.636
We are going to create
a new virtual reality glasses

50:01.766 --> 50:01.766
When you wear them

50:04.066 --> 50:08.637
You will have a full 360 degree range of vision

50:10.433 --> 50:12.401
Then we found out

50:12.433 --> 50:14.401
that the so-cal_d BBQ party

50:14.433 --> 50:17.669
is not real4r a barbecue or a party at all.

50:18.266 --> 50:20.134
They are tying to say

50:20.166 --> 50:24.370
we are meat, and the investors ''test'' us

50:25.233 --> 50:25.233
That is to say

50:26.300 --> 50:30.404
China has become the second largest market

50:31.066 --> 50:31.066
The consumers, of course, are the women like us.
of the luxuy goods after Japan

50:33.433 --> 50:33.433
So, based on this data...

50:34.733 --> 50:36.568
l prefer a short one

50:37.666 --> 50:40.468
Just like the _ngth of skirts

50:43.133 --> 50:44.634
Mr. Zhou is real4r funny

50:44.933 --> 50:46.701
We want to promote the products on...

50:46.733 --> 50:46.733
Shopping malls have already been saturated

50:48.300 --> 50:48.300
Do you have any better solutions?

50:51.133 --> 50:52.334
For instance

50:52.666 --> 50:56.336
Offering VIP customers a free breast augmentation.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.334
lt's iust an examp_

51:00.400 --> 51:00.400
Mr. Zhou

51:01.433 --> 51:01.433
l know that it has been 3 years

51:03.933 --> 51:03.933
since you didn't invest in any e-commerce proiect

51:06.466 --> 51:06.466
But p_ase give us some more time
to introduce our project

51:10.366 --> 51:13.736
l'm not too optimistic about this business

51:14.233 --> 51:17.402
Do you have a special vision of your proiect?

51:18.066 --> 51:19.300
Ladies

51:19.333 --> 51:19.333
lf you dress up sexy in this club

51:23.400 --> 51:23.400
lt would make us

51:24.900 --> 51:24.900
feel more interesting

51:26.733 --> 51:28.601
But it's a pity

51:28.633 --> 51:32.470
As you see,
this place is for our gent_men's business

51:35.199 --> 51:35.199
Mr. Zhou

51:37.300 --> 51:41.504
l know that we should have prepared more

51:42.066 --> 51:44.701
But a ham of Chinese population is fema_

51:45.199 --> 51:45.199
This business party has neg_cted

51:49.166 --> 51:51.468
What exact4r is this business meeting for ?
a ham of Chinese consumers

51:52.099 --> 51:53.401
l also believe

51:53.466 --> 51:58.437
the game will no bnger exclusive4r bebng to men.

51:59.199 --> 52:00.534
Excuse me

52:00.699 --> 52:01.667
Let's go

52:01.699 --> 52:03.301
Wait a minute

52:05.266 --> 52:07.601
Thank you so much for giving us
this valuab_ _sson

52:07.866 --> 52:11.135
A business card
shouldn't be handed to the wrong man

52:25.266 --> 52:29.436
Actual4r, l haven't told you that

52:32.366 --> 52:32.366
The Board of Directors has approved the decision

52:33.900 --> 52:33.900
to remove the directorship of Ms. Wen

52:37.133 --> 52:37.133
and to entrust Mr. Zou

52:39.400 --> 52:42.603
with full authority of the board of directors.

52:42.866 --> 52:42.866
The company will buy your shares
with 50/o higher market value

52:49.266 --> 52:50.433
About the shares

52:50.466 --> 52:52.467
l'll not even sell ham of a share

52:53.133 --> 52:53.133
This is the private company registered
in Hong Kong by Anqi

52:55.433 --> 52:57.134
The shame of the company

52:57.266 --> 52:59.201
is your mistress

53:01.800 --> 53:04.402
l'm a woman who

53:05.300 --> 53:07.468
has nothing except those stocks
which haven't been sold

53:07.633 --> 53:09.201
l feel so sory that

53:09.333 --> 53:11.435
l can't help you

53:14.933 --> 53:17.335
lf you have nothing to bse,
then you can do anything,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.569
this batt_ has iust begun

53:24.800 --> 53:26.201
Hey, cheer up

53:26.433 --> 53:29.469
it's not too late to start. You can do it

53:39.800 --> 53:39.800
DK online exclusive retail right tender notice ?

53:45.066 --> 53:47.101
That's exact4r what we need

53:47.133 --> 53:47.133
Yes, it is

53:48.033 --> 53:48.033
But the big brand like DK
will go for famous websites

53:51.133 --> 53:51.133
We don't even have a chance

53:52.266 --> 53:52.266
Just ty

53:53.366 --> 53:53.366
How do you know if you even don't ty?

53:55.333 --> 53:55.333
Grab the customers from them

53:56.866 --> 53:56.866
lt's a great chance to
increase our combat experience

53:58.900 --> 53:58.900
Oh, girl

54:00.233 --> 54:02.568
Hey, girls

54:02.800 --> 54:04.201
DK

54:04.866 --> 54:04.866
ln this world, besides men,
what l know best is this brand

54:08.233 --> 54:08.233
l've been a byal fan since l was 18

54:10.366 --> 54:13.869
l haven't missed any products in each new season

54:14.266 --> 54:15.567
Let's go

54:16.933 --> 54:16.933
Just give the DK product promotion plan to me

54:20.266 --> 54:22.034
Ok _t's do it

55:14.199 --> 55:14.199
Look, l'm not asking you for a favor

55:17.033 --> 55:17.033
But l would real4r appreciate it

55:18.800 --> 55:21.736
if you give the startup
an opportunity to nurture and grow

55:21.866 --> 55:21.866
By the way

55:23.199 --> 55:27.237
Why are you so keen on the startup company

55:28.066 --> 55:31.335
Oh, no, don't iump to conclusions

55:31.366 --> 55:34.035
l iust want to offer them a _vel playing field

55:34.166 --> 55:40.472
As to whethe
r they will be ab_ to win the bid,

55:51.800 --> 55:54.435
What is that uptight professor doing here?
this is entire4r up to their ability and effort

55:56.866 --> 55:56.866
As for the market share

55:58.366 --> 55:58.366
DK brand does not have obvious advantages,
what do you say?

56:02.166 --> 56:04.401
l think we can start from this aspect

56:05.866 --> 56:05.866
Look at that sister

56:07.066 --> 56:07.066
ls she here to do the market investigation

56:09.300 --> 56:11.402
Definite4r shopping

57:09.800 --> 57:11.067
Thank you for coming

57:17.233 --> 57:19.201
l'd like to ask eveyone here

57:19.866 --> 57:22.702
On a Chinese shopping website

57:22.866 --> 57:22.866
What is the thing that most peop_ complain about?

57:24.800 --> 57:25.800
On a Chinese shopping website

57:25.866 --> 57:25.866
What is the thing that most peop_ complain about?

57:29.733 --> 57:29.733
Um, is it deliveyJ'i

57:31.199 --> 57:31.199
lt boks like you have suffered a bt from it.

57:32.866 --> 57:32.866
that is true

57:34.199 --> 57:34.199
Damaged goods

57:35.099 --> 57:35.099
Poor attitude of the delivey man

57:37.000 --> 57:38.634
Sbw speed of delivey

57:38.800 --> 57:38.800
These are the real reasons
which resuft in bsing customers

57:41.566 --> 57:41.566
DK, as the world's _ading luxuy brand

57:44.233 --> 57:44.233
Once they offer online shopping

57:46.000 --> 57:48.802
What is the worst bss that it will face

57:50.000 --> 57:50.000
Service

57:51.199 --> 57:51.199
Afthough consumers already enioy shopping

57:57.866 --> 58:01.035
also a wide range of supporting services
bst the service from in-store shopping

58:22.300 --> 58:24.635
Would you mind come to the stage?

58:32.800 --> 58:36.670
What women enioy the most is not choosing a product

58:36.766 --> 58:38.734
Nor swiping the card

58:38.866 --> 58:41.301
lt is when a pair of white gbves

01:01:18.166 --> 01:01:21.135
Should we expand our office?

What time is it now? _t's eat

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:41.866
Finish this first

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:43.533
Hi, boss

Thank you

01:01:45.866 --> 01:01:47.500
See you next time, bye

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.634
This

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:54.333
The United States is now the world's largest

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:57.900
The Nasdaq market environment has begun to pick up
and most efficient capital market

01:02:00.866 --> 01:02:00.866
This will expand overseas IPOs

01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:05.635
This is the best opportunity for us to list

01:02:05.866 --> 01:02:08.034
Do you want to launch an IPO now ?

01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:08.066
lsn't that thrilling ?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.668
l have an idea

01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:11.866
We could cary out
a huge time-limited discount sa_

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:15.400
Put a countdown timer beside each item

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:21.035
Stimulating consumer confidence to
the highest degree

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.301
That's a brilliant idea

01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:23.466
But we would have to take a bt of risks.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.901
There must be risks

01:02:26.933 --> 01:02:26.933
We could control bsses within an acceptab_ range

01:02:29.266 --> 01:02:29.266
Whi_ maximizing sa_s

01:02:30.866 --> 01:02:30.866
That's right

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:31.900
How many chances are there to fight in your life

01:02:33.466 --> 01:02:35.534
We are to have the spirit of entrepreneurship

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.368
Say something

01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.368
As bng as we could control the risks

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:41.500
l think we can start to promote this proiect now

01:02:45.033 --> 01:02:47.435
Whether it is TV commercials or SNS

01:02:47.466 --> 01:02:48.633
Awesome

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.467
Then, that's sett_d

01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:17.736
We must dress well for our first trip to America

01:03:17.866 --> 01:03:17.866
Ah

01:03:18.466 --> 01:03:21.302
Didn't you graduate from Harvard

01:03:21.366 --> 01:03:21.366
What are you laughing at, you twoJ'i

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.668
lt is the same if l graduate later''

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.336
We are coming !

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:42.800
Suning ranked the third in B2C market

01:03:46.366 --> 01:03:46.366
lt is expected to achieve 300 billion yuan
in sa_s by 202O

01:03:50.433 --> 01:03:50.433
Starting in Ju4r last year,
the State Administration

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:52.900
Provisional ru_s for the management of

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:56.866
to regulate the behavior of network transactions
for Industy and _mmerce issued

01:03:59.933 --> 01:04:01.934
lt has brought a bt of benefits
online transactions have been imp_mented

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:04.400
Miss Lu
to crack down on counte_eit goods

01:04:04.866 --> 01:04:06.400
_uld you p_ase give us a moment?

01:04:06.699 --> 01:04:06.699
Miss Lu

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:08.567
Out

01:04:09.233 --> 01:04:10.667
Get out

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.468
How could this be?

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:18.800
l've told you already

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:19.900
Stimulating the purchase is a big risk for us

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:22.500
Now, our inventoy is far from enough

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:24.900
Deliveries are also para4rzed

01:04:26.766 --> 01:04:26.766
The customers should have received
the goods within 3 days

01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:28.733
l'm afraid
they won't get them even for ham a month .

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:31.166
This isn't helping us at all right now

01:04:33.166 --> 01:04:34.734
We must come up with some solutions ASAP

01:04:34.766 --> 01:04:36.734
Boss, we're in the news

01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:37.699
The outrage stems from
a severe delivey delay at MeiMeiWang

01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:42.133
The scandal broke out today

01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:45.768
After being evaluated at an authorized dea_r

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.304
Ms. Wang's RMB10,OOO bag
was discovered to be a fake

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:50.333
That's total4r bullshit

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:52.333
How could we have this fake good?

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:55.367
That's right

01:04:56.466 --> 01:04:57.567
lt's me

01:04:57.699 --> 01:04:57.699
What?

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.400
After we had a serious shortage of inventoy

01:05:00.266 --> 01:05:03.168
Peng Dahai introduced his supplier to me

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:03.366
l didn't think too much as it was an emergency

01:05:05.233 --> 01:05:06.667
Then l signed it

01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:06.699
Peng Dahai introduced you to them?

01:05:09.766 --> 01:05:09.766
Why didn't you _t me confirm and then sign it?

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:11.800
lt's not her fauft

01:05:13.233 --> 01:05:13.233
lt would take times to fix that distribution issue

01:05:15.766 --> 01:05:15.766
She had no choice at the time

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:20.402
That's why she signed it

01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:22.367
Peng Dahai ...

01:05:27.733 --> 01:05:27.733
At that moment, l final4r understood the meaning of

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.537
B_ssings never come in pairs,

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.334
Are you finished?

01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:39.466
Look at you, do you think a woman
misfortune doesn't come sing4r

01:05:42.433 --> 01:05:42.433
Ask yoursem

01:05:43.866 --> 01:05:46.235
Have you treated me sincere4r?
like you deserves big brand?

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:46.300
Don't you just want to
find a credit card permanent4rJ'i

01:05:49.466 --> 01:05:50.633
That's right

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:52.199
From now on

01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:55.768
l'll be my own credit card

01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:04.666
Let me tell you a secret

01:06:06.366 --> 01:06:08.568
What you have burned are authentic !

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.535
This is iust a litt_ gift from us

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.235
Hope you will like it

01:06:26.366 --> 01:06:28.434
The company like MeiMeiWang

01:06:28.699 --> 01:06:31.202
is all fraudu_nt

01:06:33.733 --> 01:06:33.733
This is

01:06:35.066 --> 01:06:38.402
the CEO of MeiMeiWang
who has foo_d all the customers

01:06:39.099 --> 01:06:40.434
Her Ug4r past

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:47.635
They also brought a big guy with them

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.501
They threatened me

01:06:49.766 --> 01:06:54.637
They wouldn't _t me go if l dared to

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:55.000
According to
the information from a search by netizens

01:06:57.166 --> 01:06:59.701
The founder of MeiMeiWang, Lu Zhenxi
expose anything to the media

01:07:00.033 --> 01:07:04.070
made a big fortune ear4r in N.Y.
by selling fake bags

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:04.333
lt is said that she has been arrested by N.Y.P.D

01:07:08.033 --> 01:07:08.033
So-cal_d studying, succeeding abroad is no prob_m

01:07:12.266 --> 01:07:12.266
ln fact, We have no idea

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:13.166
how many of them il_gal4r accumulate weafth

01:07:17.766 --> 01:07:22.137
General4r, they become great entrepreneurs

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.736
What about the fake bags in the U.S.?
what happened there ?

01:07:55.366 --> 01:07:55.366
Can we stop talking about this?
when they back home

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:57.400
You don't want to talk

01:07:59.300 --> 01:07:59.300
What you don't want to talk about

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.668
is putting us into a bigger crisis

01:08:03.266 --> 01:08:03.266
As one of the peop_ in charge of the company

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.636
l do have the right to know exact4r
what happened there

01:08:08.933 --> 01:08:08.933
Yes

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:10.300
l did that

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.000
l did some il_gal business

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:12.166
l also got caught by the police in the U.S.

01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:15.334
lt's Meng Xiaoiun who bai_d me out

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.000
What's wrong with that?

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:17.332
l sold those fake bags iust in order to

01:08:18.466 --> 01:08:18.466
make a living in that county

01:08:21.066 --> 01:08:21.066
There are count_ss ways to make a living

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:24.501
Was that the on4r choice you had?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.201
Aren't you shamed of yoursem?

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:27.100
You're iust like my ex-boyFriend

01:08:30.866 --> 01:08:32.533
What about you?

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:32.733
You weren't ab_ to use money to shut her up

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:35.399
Your solutions are no better than mine

01:08:38.166 --> 01:08:38.166
What are you talking about?

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:38.899
Are you saying that all of this is because of me?

01:08:40.233 --> 01:08:40.233
l have caused all of this, am l right?

01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:42.033
That's enough you two, stop it

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:43.033
Fighting won't be ab_ to help us at this moment

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:44.899
You don't say anything

01:08:45.933 --> 01:08:45.933
From the beginning of this issue until now

01:08:47.433 --> 01:08:50.335
l haven't heard even one apobgy from you

01:08:50.366 --> 01:08:50.366
lf you did not send those fake bags

01:08:51.933 --> 01:08:51.933
How could this issue have become this bad?

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.602
How could l know they were fake?

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:56.265
Logistics had been para4rzed,
and nothing could be sent

01:08:58.233 --> 01:08:58.233
l iust wanted to help

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:00.166
Peng Dahai lied to me

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:01.399
l'm a victim as well

01:09:02.866 --> 01:09:04.200
That's enough

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.267
lt's all my fauft

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:06.300
lt's me who couldn't dare
bok into my a_ul histoy

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:12.102
lt's my a_ul idea
which brought both of you into this crap

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.135
Me, Lu Zhenxi

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.234
l'm so sory

01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:24.134
When l run a business

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:24.866
the most frightening thing

01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:29.402
is never being ab_ to
trust my business partner again

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:33.069
Lu Zhenxi, you are a great friend

01:09:33.133 --> 01:09:33.133
But l'm sory

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:34.466
As a partner

01:09:36.198 --> 01:09:38.167
l can never trust you again

01:10:08.233 --> 01:10:09.434
Lu Zhenxi

01:10:10.899 --> 01:10:12.401
Giving up means you are bst

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:16.601
l already bst it

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.369
Real CEO must overcome any kind of crisis

01:10:21.899 --> 01:10:21.899
That's the difference between
a entrepreneur and a hawker

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.369
Do you still want to be cal_d a hawker?

01:10:29.866 --> 01:10:29.866
Let me tell you a secret

01:10:32.266 --> 01:10:34.368
l am a hawker

01:10:35.266 --> 01:10:38.869
But even a hawker needs
skill for living hand to mouth

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.769
Long live the hawkers

01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:44.233
Stop drinking

01:10:44.266 --> 01:10:46.768
Stop, stop, stop

01:10:46.866 --> 01:10:49.802
You can't soke any prob_m whi_ you are drunk

01:10:50.399 --> 01:10:52.435
Are you disappointed at me?

01:10:56.033 --> 01:10:58.568
l'm vey disappointed in mysem

01:10:59.866 --> 01:11:02.235
l thought l could manage that

01:11:05.866 --> 01:11:07.334
l'm sory

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.134
l'm so sory

01:11:13.266 --> 01:11:14.734
As a matter of fact

01:11:16.866 --> 01:11:19.435
l real4r want to stop time

01:11:19.866 --> 01:11:23.302
and return to the time you were still my assistant

01:11:42.199 --> 01:11:43.734
You are here

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:43.800
Look !

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.268
How can you _t her drink now?

01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:50.033
She's all drunk. Why don't you stop her?

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:52.800
Get up

01:11:53.866 --> 01:11:55.133
Xiaoxi

01:11:56.366 --> 01:11:56.366
Juncheng

01:11:58.233 --> 01:11:58.233
You've come to ioin us

01:12:01.133 --> 01:12:03.034
What's that for?

01:12:03.866 --> 01:12:05.801
l real4r hate you

01:12:05.933 --> 01:12:05.933
lf it wasn't you

01:12:07.066 --> 01:12:07.066
She wouldn't be like this

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:09.100
How do you mean?

01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:10.199
Because you fil_d her with unreasonab_ dreams

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:13.166
She is under great pressure

01:12:14.233 --> 01:12:16.301
Afthough you grew up with her

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.768
You don't understand her

01:12:19.133 --> 01:12:19.133
A dream for her

01:12:20.366 --> 01:12:22.301
is more important than anything else

01:12:22.866 --> 01:12:24.734
You real4r don't know her potential

01:12:24.866 --> 01:12:24.866
now l don't care about the possiblities

01:12:27.266 --> 01:12:28.667
Professor Meng

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:28.866
Look at her

01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:30.366
Can you see that?

01:12:31.933 --> 01:12:31.933
Now she got hurt because of you.

01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:36.268
lt's simp4r beating a drum in cow's ear

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:36.333
My name is Niu-Juncheng (Niu : cow)

01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:38.066
l'll show you what is beating a drum in cow's ear

01:12:40.266 --> 01:12:40.266
Fight one on one

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:42.768
So noisy

01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:47.199
Nowadays, young peop_ crab anything

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.101
They have no ambition

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.701
l real4r want to punch you now

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:53.800
That's the biggest revenge for you

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.435
Right, do it

01:12:58.866 --> 01:13:00.801
See if you can soke the prob_m with the punch

01:13:02.933 --> 01:13:02.933
You _ft MeiMeiWang

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.735
lsn't it kicking a drowning man?

01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:07.333
l can promise that if you can stay a litt_ more

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.768
all things get better

01:13:12.199 --> 01:13:12.199
Because of this,
do you ty to cacel the IPO process?

01:13:15.366 --> 01:13:18.702
When did the NASDAQ begin to discriminate nations?

01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:21.368
Current4r, the court hasn't made any decision

01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:24.069
lt's so unfair !

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:57.333
Naughty Rabbit, real name Xie Jiaqi

01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:00.199
A few days ago, she ordered a sca_ on our website

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.068
She wants to give it to her mom
as a birthday present

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:06.100
But our customer service has told her that

01:14:07.866 --> 01:14:11.269
her address is out of our postal coverage

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:11.300
Jiaqi said, in order to pay her tuition fees

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.602
her mom hasn't bought hersem
even one new dress for years.

01:14:18.033 --> 01:14:21.169
That gift is vey important to her

01:14:23.066 --> 01:14:24.667
Xiaoxi

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:25.066
What are you doing here?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Mr. Zhou wants to purchase MeiMeiWang

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:28.333
He is app4ring a bt of pressure

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:29.800
l still want to negotiate
but l couldn't find your partners

01:14:32.899 --> 01:14:32.899
l have to go on a business trip

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:34.766
There is an order in Jinchuan

01:14:35.899 --> 01:14:35.899
l want to deliver it personal4r

01:14:37.233 --> 01:14:37.233
Are you gonna go to Jinchuan now?

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:39.933
Why don't you iust put it in a parcel?

01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:43.567
Juncheng

01:14:43.766 --> 01:14:46.802
This could be the last order for MeiMeiWang

01:14:47.266 --> 01:14:49.067
l have to go

01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:52.167
This is an evasion

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:53.100
Trust me

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:54.866
Once l have been a deserter in the U.S.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.168
lt's not gonna happen again

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.801
Wait for me

01:15:17.033 --> 01:15:18.334
Helb

01:16:31.899 --> 01:16:31.899
This beautiful sca_

01:16:33.866 --> 01:16:36.668
is meant for a beautiful lady like you

01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.434
Mom

01:16:40.466 --> 01:16:44.036
Here is your favorite rose.

01:16:46.866 --> 01:16:46.866
That's real4r nice

01:16:48.766 --> 01:16:48.766
Mom, do you like it?

01:16:50.533 --> 01:16:50.533
Thank you, my dear

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:53.066
You're we_ome

01:16:54.399 --> 01:16:56.535
lt is my honor to serve you

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.468
My good girl

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:19.767
Hury

01:17:38.133 --> 01:17:40.001
Don't be afraid

01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:02.001
Xiao xi

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.701
Lu Zhenxi

01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:05.333
Xiao xi

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.535
Lu Zhenxi

01:18:08.866 --> 01:18:10.467
Xiao xi

01:18:14.033 --> 01:18:15.367
Lu Zhenxi

01:18:27.866 --> 01:18:28.766
lt's OK

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.434
You're still alive

01:19:29.433 --> 01:19:29.433
Mom

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.334
Sister

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.735
You saved two peop_'s lives

01:19:54.733 --> 01:19:54.733
That's the first time

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.671
l real4r understood what ''survivor'' means

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:00.800
A second life was given to me

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:09.438
There isn't anything more important
than life and death

01:20:10.899 --> 01:20:10.899
And l should be brave to face

01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:16.636
Whatever happens next

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:31.800
You real4r freaked me out

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.169
l was real4r worried about you

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:36.899
What if you get hurt in the face?

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:38.466
What if you get a scar?

01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:41.634
You real4r...

01:20:41.766 --> 01:20:41.766
At _ast you are an aduft

01:20:42.899 --> 01:20:45.569
Why did you go to such a dangerous place
without notice?

01:20:45.699 --> 01:20:47.701
What would you do if something happened ?

01:20:48.866 --> 01:20:48.866
l'm fine

01:20:50.366 --> 01:20:50.366
l'm an invincib_

01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:53.266
How is the company?

01:20:54.366 --> 01:20:54.366
Whether it is an apobgy or compensation

01:20:56.433 --> 01:20:56.433
We'll deal with it

01:20:58.199 --> 01:20:58.199
l've iust stabilized several brands

01:21:00.266 --> 01:21:00.266
We don't have to stop those
who real4r want to _ave

01:21:03.366 --> 01:21:06.502
what are you writing? you are a patient

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.168
Apobgy statements

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.335
We have to face it, right?

01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:52.767
Good afternoon, members of the media

01:21:53.266 --> 01:21:53.266
l'm Lu Zhenxi, the CEO of MeiMeiWang

01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:56.133
Today, as the president of MeiMeiWang

01:21:58.366 --> 01:21:58.366
To all of you here

01:21:59.800 --> 01:21:59.800
and evey client of MeiMeiWang

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.367
l earnest4r apobgize

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:06.235
For any bss or inconvenience to you

01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:08.735
due to our para4rsis of bgistics

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:09.300
We will not on4r apobgize

01:22:10.866 --> 01:22:10.866
But also provide economic compensation

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.734
The counte_eit bag issue

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.602
has nothing to do
with the original product supplier

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:21.703
lt's total4r our internal oversight

01:22:21.733 --> 01:22:21.733
This is a maior mistake

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:23.199
ln the future

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.568
How do you speed up the bgistics?

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:30.102
How do you prevent any fake product issues

01:22:30.466 --> 01:22:30.466
We

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:31.100
You still don't have product authenticity
from happening again?

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.602
Did you have any deep ref_ctions from this event?

01:22:35.699 --> 01:22:35.699
We have been through deep ref_ctions
verification mechanism

01:22:38.233 --> 01:22:38.233
So from now on,
we will improve our bgistics system,

01:22:42.033 --> 01:22:42.033
Optimize efficiency

01:22:43.366 --> 01:22:47.536
We are also committed to the unconditional

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:47.666
As for the fake products already sold

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.668
We are going to have a recall
acceptance of customer returns.

01:22:50.733 --> 01:22:50.733
And make corresponding
compensation to the customers.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:54.433
Trust me

01:22:56.399 --> 01:22:56.399
We will definite4r do our best

01:22:59.066 --> 01:22:59.066
to restore the clients' trust in us

01:23:02.433 --> 01:23:02.433
Miss Lu

01:23:03.266 --> 01:23:03.266
Can l ask you where you got iniured?

01:23:05.233 --> 01:23:05.233
And also in the web post ''Rose in the ruins''

01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:10.269
are you the one who saved the mother and daughter?

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.668
When the nurse opened the curtain

01:23:33.733 --> 01:23:33.733
l saw the one 4ring in the bed next to me

01:23:36.266 --> 01:23:39.302
is exact4r the sister who saved me and my mom

01:23:39.466 --> 01:23:43.469
We didn't say anything, on4r a smi_

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.701
At that moment, l sudden4r feft

01:23:47.066 --> 01:23:47.066
ln fact, we are all living with the kindness

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.100
That kindness

01:23:52.399 --> 01:23:56.103
A rose which will strive to bbom even in the ruins
of the strangers.

01:24:00.133 --> 01:24:02.368
What? To America?

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.100
l used to be an intern.

01:24:04.466 --> 01:24:04.466
Now l have been transferred to
the headquarter in the U.S

01:24:06.399 --> 01:24:10.170
The system will be eliminated
if it isn't not upgraded

01:24:12.766 --> 01:24:12.766
l won't be around her anymore.

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:15.333
So you'll give up the feeling
you've had all these years

01:24:18.166 --> 01:24:22.336
l'm just a man
who can go through hardships with her.

01:24:22.699 --> 01:24:26.570
And her most important thing now is her business.

01:24:26.699 --> 01:24:28.268
Take this

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:30.667
Take care of Xiaoxi

01:24:36.699 --> 01:24:40.303
Juncheng has _ft even without a good bye

01:24:44.933 --> 01:24:44.933
Because of the huge amount of compensation,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.000
So MeiMeiWang are running out of funds

01:24:52.199 --> 01:24:54.468
And the listing has been cancel_d
all the profits have been returned

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:07.068
ls this real4r the endJ'i

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:11.300
After all, we have been brilliant.

01:25:13.366 --> 01:25:14.567
So

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.268
No regrets

01:25:24.899 --> 01:25:26.468
You all have gone through all of these failures

01:25:27.366 --> 01:25:29.301
And final4r found the real success

01:25:31.399 --> 01:25:31.399
ln this world

01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:35.201
ln addition to fami4r, bve and friendship

01:25:35.433 --> 01:25:37.635
There is the fourth

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.667
That is partnership

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.068
l am proud of all of you

01:25:52.199 --> 01:25:54.268
l have a new idea

01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:01.602
l realized this at the press conference

01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:01.899
in today's society

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.269
the fastest network for information
is the mobi_ network

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:06.300
How about we integrate the mobi_ network
with the shopping

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.635
What about devebping a mobi_ shopping APP?

01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:14.567
That's right

01:26:15.266 --> 01:26:18.302
Haven't you seen how fast mobi_ APPs are growing?

01:26:19.333 --> 01:26:19.333
l think that is a brilliant idea

01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:24.636
Perhaps this will become a new trend in the future.

01:26:27.399 --> 01:26:29.535
So why don't we begin again?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.235
What name shall we name it?

01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:38.400
Still call it MeiMeiWang

01:26:41.899 --> 01:26:41.899
As for the fashion show section

01:26:43.266 --> 01:26:43.266
We will have contract cooperations with this brand,

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:45.366
pop stars and fashion models

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.802
We will launch their street shots evey week.

01:26:51.933 --> 01:26:51.933
ln addition to cooperating with our existing brands

01:26:54.266 --> 01:26:59.337
Our next step is to establish our own
designer brand

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:22.100
Has Juncheng cal_d you?

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.036
How could he contact me
without even contacting you?

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.801
Meng Xiaoiun is boking for you

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.703
So mysterious4r, will it be a marriage proposal?

01:28:34.766 --> 01:28:36.367
lt can't be

01:28:39.866 --> 01:28:41.133
Professor

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.701
Are you boking for me?

01:28:47.399 --> 01:28:47.399
You are so gbrious and brilliant, Lu Zhenxi

01:28:49.066 --> 01:28:49.066
lt's real4r rare to hear you praise me

01:28:51.066 --> 01:28:52.767
The ug4r duckling final4r
turned into a beautiful swan

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.736
So, we're back in New York

01:28:56.266 --> 01:28:57.800
Later, when we finish

01:28:58.233 --> 01:29:02.070
Would you like to go back to that police station

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.401
Anmay, today is a big day

01:29:04.433 --> 01:29:07.068
_uld you p_ase not to mention
that old crap anymore? when we first met?

01:29:11.033 --> 01:29:12.868
Lu Zhenxi

01:29:13.866 --> 01:29:17.736
l have something to give you today

01:29:18.399 --> 01:29:20.168
Professor

01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:24.233
l...

01:29:24.866 --> 01:29:26.067
Wait a minute

01:29:35.899 --> 01:29:37.468
Poor professor Meng

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.302
He wished he could have pul_d out a ring.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:41.800
That is the GPS which Juncheng gave to her

01:29:44.266 --> 01:29:44.266
That's real4r important to her

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:46.100
Do you know

01:29:46.933 --> 01:29:50.036
lt took professor Meng quite
a bng time to fix it up

01:30:06.399 --> 01:30:08.735
The devil professor has changed a bt.

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:09.233
More sentimental

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.336
Perhaps, to _t go is another kind of bve

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:17.101
l admire that man.

01:30:18.766 --> 01:30:19.700
Cheers

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.802
When Juncheng _ft, he said to me

01:30:31.066 --> 01:30:31.066
But you are the one who can make her succeed

01:30:34.233 --> 01:30:36.234
and keep running with her

01:30:39.566 --> 01:30:40.700
Do you know what time is it?

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.401
Let's eat!

01:30:43.166 --> 01:30:44.800
After we finish the work first

01:30:53.066 --> 01:30:55.368
Stop 4ring to yoursem.

01:30:57.366 --> 01:31:00.335
l wish l could see your happy smi_

01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:05.533
Ladies and gentalmen

01:31:07.133 --> 01:31:14.273
Now _t me we_ome CEO of MeiMeiWang,
Ms. Lu Zhenxi

01:31:29.333 --> 01:31:31.601

01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:36.602
lt has come true

01:31:36.766 --> 01:31:39.535
Even far beyond my expectations

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:40.300
So, l want to say thank you to my partners

01:31:42.233 --> 01:31:44.802
Ms. Wen Qing and Miss Gu Qiaoyin

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.269

And l want to say thank you to Professor Meng

01:31:51.766 --> 01:31:51.766

Doing the thing we bve with the peop_ we bve

01:31:59.933 --> 01:32:03.303
To realize each other's aspiration
and value of life.

01:32:25.933 --> 01:32:25.933
Actual4r, today

He's been beside me since we were litt_
to one person

01:32:35.866 --> 01:32:37.701
On4r except today

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.035
But it wasn't until now

01:32:40.166 --> 01:32:41.767
that l realized

01:32:42.866 --> 01:32:47.537
This dream would be meaning_ss if l bst him

01:32:48.233 --> 01:32:48.233
