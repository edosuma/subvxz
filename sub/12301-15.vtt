WEBVTT

00:59.037 --> 01:00.643
Lieutenant Caine.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.616
Sergeant Dennis barron,
tropicala P.D.

01:02.616 --> 01:03.608
Sergeant.

01:03.608 --> 01:05.274
This is off the beaten path.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.770
Orchard's about 12 feet
inside our jurisdiction.

01:07.770 --> 01:09.498
We don't get much crime out here.

01:09.590 --> 01:12.236
- You first on?
- Yep. 911 hang-up.

01:12.236 --> 01:14.325
Got here, good samaritan
was already in the wind.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.189
My antennae went up,
not your typical T.C.,

01:16.189 --> 01:18.737
So I thought I'd call in the big guns.

01:18.737 --> 01:20.367
Good samaritan...

01:20.466 --> 01:21.930
you have an ID on the victim yet?

01:21.930 --> 01:26.324
Uh, Jerry dorfman. 39.
Miami address.

01:26.324 --> 01:27.409
Okay.

01:27.409 --> 01:29.718
Alexx, what do we have here?

01:29.718 --> 01:33.020
Won't know COD till I
get him back for post,

01:33.020 --> 01:34.979
but a cursory take?

01:34.979 --> 01:37.005
He died of internal injuries.

01:37.005 --> 01:40.581
Blood in his ears, nose, mouth.

01:40.581 --> 01:41.714
Mouth.

01:41.714 --> 01:44.931
What do you make of that smudge
right there on the chin?

01:45.918 --> 01:48.529
A smudge, like you said.

01:48.529 --> 01:50.679
Okay, could be a pattern, ridge detail.

01:50.679 --> 01:52.747
Eric, amido black please.

01:52.747 --> 01:54.812
And Eric, the wind is picking up.

01:54.812 --> 01:56.643
I'm on my way.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.346
Alexx, think we can
lay him out flat?

01:59.346 --> 02:00.855
As a board.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.902
What is that? What's he doing?

02:11.902 --> 02:14.565
Hang on. / It's a solution
that reacts with the blood.

02:14.565 --> 02:18.127
It turns it dark blue, almost black.

02:18.637 --> 02:21.303
It's the kind of resources we
need down here in tropicala.

02:26.485 --> 02:27.916
Yeah.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.761
Got ridge detail.

02:29.761 --> 02:31.778
That is possibly a palm print, Alexx.

02:31.778 --> 02:34.112
See this. That's petechiae.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.759
His eyes are dotted with red.

02:35.759 --> 02:37.292
Definite petechiae.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.516
This man was asphyxiated.

02:45.515 --> 02:47.164
The guy who called it in.

02:47.287 --> 02:50.017
yep. Our good samaritan...

02:50.655 --> 02:52.333
just became a murderer.

03:28.062 --> 03:31.612
MIAMI
2x15 Stalkerazzi

03:53.117 --> 03:55.695
Weather's not doing us any favors.

04:00.188 --> 04:04.896
Any tire tracks or shoe prints
we might have had are gone.

04:05.108 --> 04:08.001
Erasing any evidence our killer left.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.730
I think this guy must have
lived in his car.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.144
Rear seat's been removed.

04:15.517 --> 04:17.396
Yeah, I got a cell phone.

04:17.844 --> 04:20.779
I'll have Tyler run a reverse
directory on it.

04:25.241 --> 04:27.943
Okay, I'm going to give you
two guesses what this is.

04:27.943 --> 04:29.745
And it's not mountain dew.

04:29.745 --> 04:31.505
I can smell it from here.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.559
I'm going to let you
take it back to the lab.

04:33.693 --> 04:35.432
That's very nice of you.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.566
The windows are spotless.

04:47.684 --> 04:50.284
Okay, so he lives in his car.

04:50.284 --> 04:52.330
He doesn't even leave
to go to the bathroom,

04:52.330 --> 04:54.679
and his windows are sparkling clean.

04:54.679 --> 04:57.621
Maybe he's some kind
of PI on a stakeout.

04:59.253 --> 05:01.972
What kind of PI doesn't
have a pen and paper?

05:05.207 --> 05:07.883
Well, Jerry dorfman
was no health nut.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.029
Got his stomach contents.

05:09.029 --> 05:11.670
Coconut, chocolate and almonds.

05:11.670 --> 05:16.767
Candy bars. / Also found
some black fibers in his nostrils.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.837
It's probably from whatever
the assailant used to smother him.

05:23.847 --> 05:26.732
He also has an elongated
abrasion on his arm.

05:26.732 --> 05:28.158
From the broken glass.

05:28.158 --> 05:30.266
Well, that's what I thought at first,

05:30.266 --> 05:32.910
but the wound was ragged, not smooth.

05:33.038 --> 05:35.328
And I found a splinter
of wood in it.

05:39.296 --> 05:42.731
Okay, wood. Well, he did crash
in an orchard, didn't he, Alexx?

05:42.731 --> 05:44.354
Look at this.

05:45.287 --> 05:46.610
Inflammation.

05:46.610 --> 05:50.156
Early stages. Probably from
something on the wood.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.400
It's definitely perimoridium.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.482
My guess is about 20
minutes before the crash.

05:54.482 --> 05:57.042
Okay, any other injuries?

05:57.042 --> 05:59.690
Just trauma from the steering wheel.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.883
Alexx,

06:01.883 --> 06:04.607
could he have survived
the original impact?

06:04.607 --> 06:09.050
Good paramedics
and a helicopter, maybe.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.826
Horatio, it doesn't make
sense, does it?

06:11.826 --> 06:14.311
Someone smothers
him, then calls 911.

06:14.311 --> 06:19.349
It almost sounds like we have two parties
with conflicting agendas, doesn't it?

06:20.154 --> 06:21.468
Thank you, Alexx.

06:26.881 --> 06:28.383
I'm working on the palm print.

06:28.383 --> 06:30.140
It's from the left hand.

06:30.485 --> 06:33.592
It appears to be from the hypothenar
portion. Right below the pinkie.

06:36.618 --> 06:38.179
This statewide?

06:38.179 --> 06:41.076
I figured I'd start with Dade first
and then branch out.

06:46.718 --> 06:48.500
Ralph durst.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.905
Trespassing, parking violations,

06:50.905 --> 06:52.283
T.R.O.s

06:52.283 --> 06:55.692
Okay, Eric, you go find Ralph
and pick him up, all right?

07:05.282 --> 07:06.479
Come on, man,
let me in the lobby.

07:06.479 --> 07:08.790
It's a public place.
The party's in the back.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.844
- Room key.
- You know I'm not staying here.

07:10.844 --> 07:12.007
I just want to take his picture.

07:12.007 --> 07:15.139
I do more for his career than those
folks who see his movies. Come on.

07:15.139 --> 07:18.103
Room key. / Lighten up!
Hey, Brad! Brad!

07:32.084 --> 07:33.407
Slow down.

07:33.407 --> 07:34.988
Hey, name Ralph durst?

07:34.988 --> 07:36.120
Yeah. What?

07:36.120 --> 07:37.807
- I'm working, man.
- Not anymore.

07:37.807 --> 07:40.115
- Hey, man, what are you...?
- You're taking a ride with us. Miami PD.

07:40.115 --> 07:42.266
What are you talking about?
Get your hands off my camera.

07:43.802 --> 07:47.196
If this is about cameron,
I've kept it 100 yards,

07:47.196 --> 07:51.263
just like on the T.R.O.,
Which, if you ask me, is BS.

07:51.686 --> 07:53.252
I just want a picture.

07:53.252 --> 07:56.860
30 seconds of their time.
They're in public, they're public domain.

07:58.054 --> 07:59.652
What about this picture, hmm?

07:59.652 --> 08:01.241
Does he look familiar?

08:02.158 --> 08:04.015
Jerry dorfman.

08:04.015 --> 08:05.532
Stalkerazzi.

08:05.532 --> 08:07.227
Just like you, stalkerazzi.

08:07.227 --> 08:09.565
No, I'm a photojournalist.

08:09.652 --> 08:12.660
I work red carpets.
Legitimate events.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.991
Jerry's a...

08:13.991 --> 08:16.061
bottom feeder.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.765
Sticks cameras under bathroom stalls.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.555
that kind of thing.

08:20.555 --> 08:23.037
Let me ask you something,
Ralph, did you suffocate Jerry?

08:23.037 --> 08:24.645
No, I didn't.

08:24.645 --> 08:29.113
We found your handprint
across his face in his blood.

08:29.113 --> 08:31.330
Okay,

08:31.330 --> 08:32.924
okay.

08:36.006 --> 08:37.878
I was driving celebrity row.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.481
Prowling.

08:39.916 --> 08:42.097
Jerry races by me.

08:42.644 --> 08:45.140
He's being followed by
by a black escalade.

08:53.362 --> 08:55.199
You see who was in it? / No.

08:55.199 --> 08:57.347
But, you know, rich neighborhood,

08:57.347 --> 08:59.898
limo tint on all the windows
had to be a celebrity.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.816
So you followed them. / Yeah.

09:01.816 --> 09:05.333
Naturally. / A celebrity punching
a photographer is big bucks.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.764
Especially if it's an A-lister.

09:06.764 --> 09:09.753
But I got stuck behind a truck
I couldn't get around.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.250
But you managed to
catch up, right? / Yeah,

09:23.250 --> 09:26.333
by the time I got there,
though, he'd crashed.

09:30.723 --> 09:32.845
What about this black escalade?
What happened?

09:33.218 --> 09:35.011
Beats me.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.388
I mean, nobody was there
when I got there.

09:38.388 --> 09:41.093
So I did what I do
at every car wreck.

09:46.969 --> 09:48.514
Took his picture?

09:48.514 --> 09:50.601
Why? He's not a celebrity.

09:50.601 --> 09:53.345
There's a big market for death photos.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.870
Mostly in mexico.

09:56.484 --> 09:58.349
The gorier the better.

09:58.349 --> 10:00.185
You're sure you didn't
suffocate him first?

10:00.185 --> 10:03.279
No. / Then why was
your hand on his mouth?

10:05.370 --> 10:07.092
I was moving his head

10:07.092 --> 10:09.027
to get a better shot.

10:27.031 --> 10:29.376
I dialed 911 before I left.

10:29.376 --> 10:31.630
I thought maybe those guys could

10:31.630 --> 10:34.476
jump start him,
you know, bring him back.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.466
I'm going to need
your cameras and film.

10:36.466 --> 10:38.000
You kidding? That's how
I make a living.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.306
You should have thought
of that before.

10:40.996 --> 10:42.221
When do I get them back?

10:42.221 --> 10:45.235
You get them back when I say so.

10:54.774 --> 10:56.967
Anything from Ralph's camera?

10:57.129 --> 10:58.432
His own prints.

10:58.432 --> 11:00.529
Collection of salt air.

11:00.930 --> 11:03.303
He was definitely working
the collins avenue area.

11:03.303 --> 11:04.812
You get his death photos?

11:04.812 --> 11:06.695
Yeah, the lab just developed.

11:07.399 --> 11:10.038
He makes them look almost beautiful.

11:10.435 --> 11:13.177
The photo tech said it was from
composition and aperture stop,

11:13.177 --> 11:14.732
for what it's worth.

11:14.732 --> 11:17.350
Old Ralph may just be an artist.

11:18.435 --> 11:21.172
Makes you wonder what he was
doing being a stalkerazzi.

11:21.172 --> 11:23.319
Well, I can't remember the last
time I bought a painting,

11:23.319 --> 11:25.146
but I never forget to pick up my tabs.

11:25.146 --> 11:27.053
I can't believe you actually
buy those things.

11:27.053 --> 11:30.042
Well, that's because the Y-chromosome
does not have the gossip gene.

11:30.042 --> 11:31.854
I don't know. They're fun.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.253
All right, so we got our
crime photos and Ralph'S.

11:37.402 --> 11:40.123
Before and after shots.

11:40.123 --> 11:41.705
So, I guess Ralph was telling the truth.

11:41.705 --> 11:44.394
These pictures proved
he moved Jerry's head.

11:44.562 --> 11:46.080
Back to the drawing board.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.763
Well, maybe not.

11:48.652 --> 11:52.084
Now, these are our crime photos,
and these are Ralph's shots.

11:52.084 --> 11:53.444
Look at that.

11:54.254 --> 11:56.936
The glass has been moved
to the back of the seat cushion.

11:57.219 --> 11:58.755
Yeah.

12:01.105 --> 12:03.848
And the fast food bag's been moved.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.912
Well, paramedics, cops, us...

12:06.912 --> 12:09.235
I mean, anyone could have moved it.

12:09.566 --> 12:10.835
Yeah, but it's not just moved.

12:10.835 --> 12:13.049
It's stuck between the cushion.

12:15.223 --> 12:17.902
Well, then we should go
and see what's under it.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.115
Ice packs, to keep the film cold.

12:44.115 --> 12:46.611
Yeah, between the heat
and humidity around here.

12:46.611 --> 12:48.718
good film will melt
in a couple hours.

12:48.718 --> 12:52.024
So, there's a paparazzi
with no film and no camera.

12:52.024 --> 12:54.626
It's that good samaritan discount.

13:00.959 --> 13:04.675
Tell you what, somebody didn't like
those pictures that were in Jerry's camera.

13:53.210 --> 13:54.445
Hey, you wanted to see us?

13:54.445 --> 13:55.863
Yeah.

13:56.073 --> 13:57.544
Take a look at this.

13:59.369 --> 14:01.997
This was recovered
from Jerry dorfman.

14:01.997 --> 14:03.449
Looks like plant material. / Yeah,

14:03.449 --> 14:05.967
and not indigenous to miami.

14:06.976 --> 14:10.350
Looks like fibers from a
south american kapok tree.

14:10.568 --> 14:14.400
It's the warmest jacket lining
that you can buy that's not down.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.275
Allergies.

14:16.410 --> 14:19.350
On the screen, we have
potassium acephate.

14:19.350 --> 14:22.738
Yeah, insecticide otherwise
known as orthene.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.359
Weren't they spraying
tropicala with orthene?

14:25.359 --> 14:28.173
I thought I read something in the
paper about a weevil infestation.

14:28.173 --> 14:31.195
That's right. / Residents said
they didn't get enough warning.

14:31.195 --> 14:34.345
They left their bentleys out,
and the acephate ate their paint jobs.

14:34.345 --> 14:36.750
Very impressive, speed.
Two words,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.371
Road trip.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.609
Well,

14:57.609 --> 14:59.376
got a kapok tree.

15:04.085 --> 15:05.371
Check this out.

15:12.158 --> 15:13.546
Candy bar wrapper.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.908
Chocolate, almonds, coconuts.

15:24.987 --> 15:25.986
Ring a bell?

15:25.986 --> 15:28.003
Just like Jerry's stomach contents.

15:42.582 --> 15:44.455
Give me, huh, give me a boost.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.395
You see anything?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.922
Yep.

16:13.868 --> 16:17.313
Got a big yard, nice pool.

16:17.584 --> 16:19.066
Beautiful house. / Well,

16:19.066 --> 16:22.806
his stomach contents put him
here sometime before that crash.

16:27.414 --> 16:30.415
Yeah, so, the question is,
who lives here?

16:33.367 --> 16:35.619
Heard your radio transmission.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.818
What are you boys doing here?

16:36.818 --> 16:41.901
We are finding out what could be the last place
Jerry dorfman worked before he got killed.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.364
You're trespassing on private property.

16:44.511 --> 16:46.003
If you want to continue,
you need a warrant.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.615
And then we go in the front door.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.994
This is a murder investigation.

16:49.994 --> 16:52.360
We go through windows if we have to.

16:55.647 --> 16:56.592
Look, boys,

16:56.592 --> 16:58.914
rich folks live here for one reason.

16:58.914 --> 17:01.868
tropicala PD's dedication
to their privacy.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.817
They like their anonymity.

17:03.817 --> 17:07.173
That's why they drive around in
half-million-dollar convertibles?

17:07.173 --> 17:09.549
Tropicala's the new beverly hills.

17:09.710 --> 17:10.955
Who lives here?

17:10.955 --> 17:12.580
Can't tell you that.

17:12.580 --> 17:14.724
Okay, I'll ask the pool man.

17:15.015 --> 17:17.101
I can always arrest you.

17:17.101 --> 17:18.670
Okay, we're gone.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.959
- We're leaving.
- That's a good idea.

17:25.323 --> 17:27.626
Okay. What was that address again?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.902
When are you going to learn
how to type? That's garden street.

17:29.902 --> 17:33.602
I can type, Okay? I just, uh,
forget things sometimes.

17:39.478 --> 17:41.093
Oh, I don't believe it.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.579
- What?
- This is Brad tustin's house.

17:43.579 --> 17:46.407
You mean death grip 2000 Brad tustin?

17:46.407 --> 17:49.223
Body count and double tap,
even though those movies sucked.

17:49.223 --> 17:51.172
Yeah, but you saw every one
of them, didn't you?

17:51.172 --> 17:52.977
Well, right now he's the prime suspect,

17:52.977 --> 17:56.061
and I'm sure H is going to want
us to bring him in, so...

17:58.549 --> 18:00.462
Hi, I'm Jenny moylan,
Brad's publicist.

18:00.462 --> 18:01.787
We spoke on the phone.

18:01.787 --> 18:04.936
- Yes, I recall.
- I'll just go around the room.

18:04.936 --> 18:06.495
This is Peter goldfarb.

18:06.495 --> 18:08.039
He's Brad's entertainment lawyer.

18:08.039 --> 18:10.088
Leonard samuelson,
he's his manager.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.494
Kala, electronic P.R.,

18:11.494 --> 18:13.608
And Melissa,
Brad's personal assiant.

18:13.608 --> 18:17.060
Someone, Jenny, is missing.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.757
Yes, well, Brad doesn't
speak with anyone.

18:18.757 --> 18:21.549
If he wants to stay out
of jail, he'd better learn.

18:21.596 --> 18:23.692
Now, I thought this was
concerning my phone records.

18:23.692 --> 18:25.508
It's actually about murder.

18:25.652 --> 18:28.241
Well, Brad's not involved
in any murder.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.022
Who's dead?

18:33.074 --> 18:36.326
Ah, Jerry dorfman,
celebrity photographer.

18:36.326 --> 18:37.759
Was he a friend?

18:38.202 --> 18:40.274
He's more like an unfortunate
business expense.

18:40.274 --> 18:42.351
How compassionate of you.

18:43.854 --> 18:46.392
You know, I don't think I should say anything
else without calling Brad's criminal attorney.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.628
I get a warrant, this will
become public record.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.118
You know that.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.508
So, that's up to you.

19:00.457 --> 19:02.878
It's me. I think you ought
to make an appearance.

19:05.710 --> 19:06.991
All right.

19:08.096 --> 19:10.070
You guys want to give us
a moment, please?

19:16.888 --> 19:19.391
When was the last time
you were at Brad's house?

19:20.220 --> 19:22.828
I have devoted my entire
career to Brad tustin.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.561
I would do anything
to protect him.

19:24.561 --> 19:26.112
Including kill someone?

19:29.962 --> 19:31.103
Jenny, you okay?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.454
I'm fine.

19:32.454 --> 19:33.879
Lieutenant Caine,

19:33.879 --> 19:36.069
Brad tustin. / Yes.

19:36.856 --> 19:39.817
Well, that was fast.

19:39.817 --> 19:41.615
I was outside in the car.

19:41.615 --> 19:45.640
Of course, I'm fully prepared
to cooperate with your investigation.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.848
I find that so comforting.

19:48.044 --> 19:51.313
Did you know, um,
Jerry dorfman, Brad?

19:51.313 --> 19:54.185
Well, usually he's shoving
a camera in my face.

19:55.147 --> 19:57.235
You look pretty angry
in that photograph.

19:57.235 --> 20:01.544
He shoved a camera up my girlfriend's
dress, freaked the hell out of her.

20:01.732 --> 20:04.147
Called it his thong shot.

20:04.147 --> 20:06.636
Fair enough. Where were
you yesterday?

20:06.636 --> 20:07.783
On set,

20:07.783 --> 20:10.456
with about a hundred witnesses.

20:11.395 --> 20:13.738
I got nothing to hide.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.974
Hey.

20:19.508 --> 20:22.586
Horatio is with Brad and his publicist.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.751
Hollywood scandal, huh?

20:25.751 --> 20:28.298
I'm glad this case hasn't stopped
you from reading the tabloids.

20:28.298 --> 20:29.915
This is for research.

20:29.915 --> 20:33.422
Although I would like to say,
hollywood's plastic surgery secrets..

20:33.422 --> 20:34.719
I knew these were fake.

20:34.719 --> 20:38.279
Amazing they pay somebody to sit
in front of a plastic surgeon's office

20:38.279 --> 20:40.741
and snap off after photos.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.581
Hey, wait a minute.
This is Brad tustin.

20:47.468 --> 20:50.745
Oh, that's sweet.
Looks like he really cares for her.

20:53.954 --> 20:55.548
Wait a second.

21:00.732 --> 21:02.299
Look at that.

21:02.453 --> 21:04.703
Look at the shot on the magazine.

21:04.703 --> 21:06.427
Look at Delko's pictures.

21:06.427 --> 21:08.092
It's the exact same angle.

21:08.752 --> 21:11.526
Are these the pictures
from Jerry's missing film?

21:13.098 --> 21:15.056
Yeah.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.690
They must be.

21:18.248 --> 21:24.057
Now, why would somebody steal
pictures of action hero Brad and a girl?

21:24.518 --> 21:26.064
Maybe the girl was married?

21:26.064 --> 21:27.897
I think it's something else.

21:28.811 --> 21:32.562
Look at the legs.
They're long, muscled...

21:32.713 --> 21:34.370
so, she's a swimmer.

21:34.370 --> 21:36.791
Not for the girls' team, she isn't.

21:38.293 --> 21:41.235
Hey, I think we may
have just found a motive.

21:41.235 --> 21:46.960
Hollywood scandal magazine has naked
pictures of Brad tustin with a naked man.

21:46.960 --> 21:51.509
With a naked man? That is gonna do wonders
for an action star's image, isn't it?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.571
and here is Jerry's missing picture, right?

21:57.571 --> 21:58.903
Stolen from his car.

21:58.903 --> 22:01.776
So, how'd the magazine get it,
because Jerry's dead

22:01.776 --> 22:04.943
and Brad tustin, I'm certain, didn't
want those pictures in the tabloid.

22:04.943 --> 22:09.400
And we know one picture
is worth a thousand words.

22:22.998 --> 22:24.833
We're going to need the
rest of the pictures.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.500
You'll have to wait for our
next issue, just like our readers.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.565
We have a warrant, Mr. Kaye,

22:29.565 --> 22:31.842
for all the original negatives.

22:33.456 --> 22:35.420
- What for?
- I can't discuss that with you,

22:35.420 --> 22:38.307
but your cooperation
would be much appreciated.

22:38.307 --> 22:40.654
No problem.
How about I give you the photos,

22:40.654 --> 22:42.904
and you give us first crack at the story?

22:42.904 --> 22:44.012
I can't do that.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.052
It's part of an ongoing
murder investigation.

22:46.052 --> 22:47.951
Murder sells magazines, officer.

22:47.951 --> 22:51.058
Celebrity murder sells
millions of magazines.

22:51.058 --> 22:54.685
O.J., Robert blake. You can dine out
on those guys for months.

22:56.024 --> 22:58.193
We're going to need to know
who sold you those photos.

22:58.193 --> 23:00.334
That I can't tell you.
It was an anonymous tip.

23:00.334 --> 23:01.645
The guy was a total amateur.

23:01.645 --> 23:04.010
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause he sold the photos for ten grand.

23:04.010 --> 23:06.317
He could have got 20 times that
on the open market.

23:06.317 --> 23:07.952
Maybe he was afraid of getting caught.

23:07.952 --> 23:09.314
Did you ever meet with him?

23:09.314 --> 23:11.344
No, no. I talked to him on the phone.

23:11.344 --> 23:14.248
We paid cash. He dropped
the film off in our mailbox.

23:14.248 --> 23:16.869
Do you remember anything from
your phone conversation with him?

23:16.869 --> 23:18.281
I don't need to remember.

23:18.281 --> 23:19.289
Got it all on tape.

23:19.289 --> 23:21.060
Do you record all of
your phone conversations?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.474
We shelled out over $20 million
in settlements last year.

23:23.474 --> 23:24.981
Legal's got us covering our asses.

23:24.981 --> 23:27.288
All right, good. We're
going to need that tape.

23:27.288 --> 23:29.703
First amendment says no way.

23:29.809 --> 23:33.478
Well, the fourth amendment says I can
get a telephonic warrant in the next hour.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.004
So do you want to dial?

23:40.079 --> 23:42.524
I have some confiscated
property in my possession.

23:42.524 --> 23:46.480
photos of a male superstar
in a compromising position.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.362
I'd be willing to discuss a transaction.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.127
I've listened to this tape three times

23:51.127 --> 23:54.347
and the caller never gives
a name or a contact number.

23:54.347 --> 23:56.282
Anything from the voice?

23:56.282 --> 24:00.376
Nothing distinguishing. I mean,
the accent could be mid-atlantic, but

24:00.376 --> 24:02.451
speech is very formal.

24:02.731 --> 24:04.336
You know what? Play it again.

24:07.325 --> 24:09.540
I have some confiscated
property in my possession.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.548
photos of a male superstar
in a compromising position.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.743
I'd be willing to discuss a transaction.

24:16.649 --> 24:20.165
Confiscated property,
possession, transaction

24:20.165 --> 24:22.557
it sounds like someone
with a legal background.

24:22.557 --> 24:24.592
I know who this is.

24:27.339 --> 24:28.772
Lieutenant Caine.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.325
I don't recall seeing you
in my appointment book.

24:32.183 --> 24:33.922
That's because I..

24:33.922 --> 24:36.456
didn't have an appointment, sergeant.

24:36.456 --> 24:38.390
I see that you're, uh,

24:38.390 --> 24:40.871
a Brad tustin fan.

24:41.511 --> 24:43.621
Dealing with celebrities
is part of the job.

24:43.621 --> 24:45.999
The difference between
being a patrol cop

24:45.999 --> 24:48.062
and a glorified trash collector.

24:50.176 --> 24:53.917
Is part of your job tampering
with a crime scene?

24:54.079 --> 24:55.598
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:55.598 --> 24:59.083
You stole a roll of film
from Jerry dorfman's car,

24:59.083 --> 25:03.184
and you sold it to a tabloid.
That's what I'm talking about.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.207
I'd like to see you prove that.

25:05.365 --> 25:07.874
Be careful what you wish for.

25:10.981 --> 25:13.759
I have some confiscated
property in my possession.

25:13.759 --> 25:17.749
photos of a male superstar
in a compromising position.

25:17.749 --> 25:19.814
I'd be willing to
discuss a transaction.

25:19.814 --> 25:22.962
We do negotiate those items
then we do purchase stuff.

25:26.448 --> 25:28.098
All right, so I sold a roll of film.

25:28.098 --> 25:30.650
- What's the big deal?
- Tampering with a crime scene, sergeant,

25:30.650 --> 25:33.000
is punishable by jail time.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.562
Don't quote the book to me, lieutenant.

25:34.562 --> 25:36.444
I secured the scene
and called for backup.

25:36.444 --> 25:38.835
Everything I did was by the book.

25:48.887 --> 25:51.210
By the book. What else did you take?

25:53.252 --> 25:55.609
What else did you take, sergeant?

25:56.703 --> 25:58.237
I took a hat, but that's it.

25:58.237 --> 25:59.983
I need the hat.

26:13.103 --> 26:14.570
It's just a hat.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.316
And that's why you

26:16.316 --> 26:18.740
are just a patrol cop.

26:59.765 --> 27:02.275
Carrie, please tell me
we got DNA from that hat.

27:02.275 --> 27:03.681
I'll do you one better.

27:03.681 --> 27:05.875
That hat was your murder weapon.

27:06.086 --> 27:07.433
Okay. Saliva?

27:07.433 --> 27:08.678
Yep.

27:08.678 --> 27:11.103
Good. Okay. So that's
how Jerry was smothered.

27:20.757 --> 27:22.135
That hat was worn a lot.

27:22.135 --> 27:23.964
Perspiration on the band.

27:23.964 --> 27:26.369
The victim was smothered
with his own hat.

27:26.369 --> 27:27.456
No.

27:27.456 --> 27:29.110
Different donor on the band.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.043
Amelogenin says it's male.

27:31.043 --> 27:32.988
There's nothing yet on CODIS.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.894
All right. Let me know
if you get a hit, okay?

27:34.894 --> 27:37.364
This may be the only way
we can crack this case.

27:37.521 --> 27:38.743
Sure.

27:43.298 --> 27:46.168
Those the photos the tabloids
handed over to us?

27:46.907 --> 27:48.056
Yeah.

27:48.056 --> 27:51.527
It's kind of hard to believe
someone would kill over a photograph.

27:51.527 --> 27:55.374
Are you kidding? Come on. These
pictures are about to kill Brad tustin's career.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.586
Really?

27:56.586 --> 27:59.888
He's one of the most popular
movies stars on the planet.

27:59.888 --> 28:02.866
Besides, I thought it was kind
of cool to be gay these days.

28:02.866 --> 28:04.375
It's cool to be whoever you are,

28:04.375 --> 28:06.806
but gay action hero,
that's kind of tough.

28:06.806 --> 28:08.994
And you really think
the audience cares?

28:08.994 --> 28:11.716
If he's redecorating your apartment,

28:11.716 --> 28:14.305
maybe not so much.
But saving the world...

28:14.305 --> 28:16.274
who does that look like to you?

28:16.490 --> 28:18.982
What? / There, through the window.

28:23.739 --> 28:25.106
A reflection.

28:25.106 --> 28:29.081
I know. I thought so, too, at first, but
take a look at the picture taken right after.

28:32.631 --> 28:35.623
It could have been a ghost
from the processing of the film.

28:35.623 --> 28:38.569
But then look at this one
of Brad and his friend.

28:42.203 --> 28:44.169
You say these pictures were
done with an autowinder?

28:44.169 --> 28:46.331
Yeah, four frames per second.

28:54.263 --> 28:55.418
Okay.

28:55.571 --> 28:57.052
What are you doing?

28:57.167 --> 28:58.405
I'm making a kinescope.

28:58.405 --> 28:59.819
A what?

29:00.651 --> 29:03.863
It's a little experiment, okay?
You'll just have to wait and see.

29:05.695 --> 29:07.638
Oh, it's a flip book.

29:09.845 --> 29:11.671
Check out the heads.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.834
They're definitely
looking at something.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.360
See the birds?

29:15.360 --> 29:17.457
Something startled them.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.845
A noise or something.

29:20.244 --> 29:23.292
The ghost image is
probably a gunshot.

29:28.162 --> 29:29.987
Blow up.

29:29.987 --> 29:31.227
Wider? Not zoom in?

29:31.227 --> 29:33.569
It's a movie from the '60s.

29:33.681 --> 29:34.671
Never heard of it.

29:34.671 --> 29:37.659
Calleigh, can we zoom in on this?

29:45.151 --> 29:47.247
Oh, my goodness.

29:47.247 --> 29:52.525
Okay. I want to see the rest of the
pictures, same magnification, please.

29:57.193 --> 29:58.810
That was the last exposed frame.

29:58.810 --> 30:03.255
That's the last of Jerry's pictures
and we still can't see the shooter's face.

30:03.346 --> 30:07.452
While he thought he was taking
pictures of Brad tustin and his friend...

30:10.208 --> 30:13.206
he caught the murder
by mistake, didn't he?

30:14.186 --> 30:16.058
I'm going to get Tyler
in here to clean this up.

30:16.058 --> 30:19.286
Okay, You do that. I'm going to pay
Brad's next-door neighbor a visit.

30:19.286 --> 30:22.740
I think our victim may have
witnessed a murder.

30:31.670 --> 30:32.751
Look at them.

30:32.751 --> 30:34.819
They'll never leave Brad tustin alone.

30:34.819 --> 30:35.961
They smell blood.

30:35.961 --> 30:37.184
Well, so do I.

30:37.184 --> 30:40.190
So who is Brad's next-door neighbor?

30:40.403 --> 30:42.095
Danny cato.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.359
Danny cato?

30:45.535 --> 30:47.316
The actor?

30:47.465 --> 30:49.944
Danny cato, the movie star.

30:49.944 --> 30:53.195
A shooting in my house. Yeah, I
think I'd know something about that.

30:53.195 --> 30:54.594
Do you own a gun, Mr. Cato?

30:54.594 --> 30:56.069
No. Guns scare me.

30:56.069 --> 30:58.646
You certainly know how to handle one.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.434
I've seen your movies.

31:00.434 --> 31:02.239
Thank you.
A lot of people have seen my movies,

31:02.239 --> 31:04.978
but movies aren't real, are they?

31:05.409 --> 31:07.236
Where'd you get that
cut on your hand?

31:08.018 --> 31:10.895
A sword fight yesterday
and a clumsy stuntman.

31:10.895 --> 31:12.282
Looks like it hurt.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.405
Well, you know what they say,
Pain is temporary,

31:14.405 --> 31:17.358
but film is forever. Right?

31:17.569 --> 31:19.906
You know, while we're on the subject,

31:20.711 --> 31:23.017
let's take a look

31:23.529 --> 31:25.461
at my film.

31:30.144 --> 31:33.442
Oh, yeah, we were...

31:33.442 --> 31:35.941
working in here the other day.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.472
Hey!

31:39.233 --> 31:40.842
It's a prop.

31:40.842 --> 31:43.429
Yeah. / It's a prop.
This one isn't.

31:45.768 --> 31:47.171
We were rehearsing a scene.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.670
I mean...

31:49.121 --> 31:50.883
It's clear.

31:51.406 --> 31:52.527
For a movie?

31:52.527 --> 31:53.948
Yeah.

31:54.267 --> 31:58.059
Yeah, production sent over a
stuntwoman. They do it all the time.

31:58.685 --> 32:00.396
Which movie?

32:01.144 --> 32:04.425
It's a sequel. Miami shield II.

32:05.818 --> 32:08.315
MS II. / Yeah.

32:08.315 --> 32:10.187
We're going to shoot right here in town.

32:10.187 --> 32:12.495
You want a hat? I've got about 20...

32:12.495 --> 32:17.011
I would rather have
a sample of your DNA.

32:19.116 --> 32:20.491
I got nothing to hide.

32:20.491 --> 32:23.356
Everyone has something to hide.

32:24.694 --> 32:25.997
We need to find this stuntwoman.

32:25.997 --> 32:27.533
Does that include underwater rescue?

32:27.533 --> 32:29.651
Birds in the air. The works.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.589
We need to find her.

32:59.492 --> 33:01.167
Hey.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.195
What's, uh,

33:04.195 --> 33:05.416
what's the deal with the camera?

33:05.416 --> 33:07.076
It's just a little experiment.

33:07.076 --> 33:09.063
You're gonna have to wait and see.

33:09.356 --> 33:11.053
There's no starburst.

33:11.053 --> 33:13.613
What's the translation for that?

33:13.789 --> 33:18.253
Okay, the photo on the left is from
the prop gun that Danny cato gave Horatio.

33:18.253 --> 33:22.014
The photo on the right is from a real
nine-millimeter that belongs to us.

33:22.014 --> 33:24.149
Okay, the muzzle flashes are different.

33:24.149 --> 33:25.033
Exactly.

33:25.033 --> 33:28.307
The muzzle flash is basically just
a combination of hot dust and

33:28.307 --> 33:31.395
carbon monoxide
followed by a projectile.

33:38.953 --> 33:41.391
Now, prop pistols don't use a projectile.

33:41.391 --> 33:43.124
Right, but they're still dangerous. I mean...

33:43.124 --> 33:44.961
yes, potentially.

33:44.961 --> 33:50.047
What prop pistols use is a blank
firing device, and it creates a slide,

33:50.047 --> 33:52.794
and that causes a star-shaped burst.

33:52.794 --> 33:56.976
The muzzle flash from Danny cato's
house has no starburst pattern.

33:56.976 --> 33:58.750
so it was a real gun.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.269
And he also lied about owning a gun.

34:01.608 --> 34:02.986
He registered a firearm?

34:02.986 --> 34:04.400
Nine mil.

34:12.309 --> 34:13.324
Danny?

34:13.324 --> 34:14.534
Danny cato,

34:14.534 --> 34:17.487
we have a warrant
to search the premises.

34:17.592 --> 34:19.340
Who are you?

34:19.340 --> 34:21.036
Gabe rotter.

34:21.036 --> 34:23.304
What are you doing
at Danny cato's house?

34:23.693 --> 34:25.362
I live here.

34:25.483 --> 34:27.219
You care to explain that, Gabe?

34:27.219 --> 34:29.097
I'm Danny's personal assistant.

34:29.097 --> 34:30.379
Very personal.

34:30.379 --> 34:33.257
- You live at his house.
- Well, I'm also his stand-in. I mean,

34:33.257 --> 34:36.520
I'm really an actor,
but I,I double for Danny on set.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.918
Gabe... / Look, you want to talk
to Danny, not me.

34:38.918 --> 34:40.681
I mean, I can give him a message.

34:40.681 --> 34:44.152
Tell Danny that you're going to
be busy for quite a while, all right?

34:44.152 --> 34:45.328
You're coming with us.

34:45.328 --> 34:46.907
Hey, I, I told you,

34:46.907 --> 34:48.114
I'm just his stand-in.

34:48.114 --> 34:51.353
In more ways than one,
I'm guessing. Ready?

35:33.609 --> 35:38.357
Look, we found your DNA on the hat that
you suffocated Jerry dorfman with.

35:38.357 --> 35:40.253
So we know you did it.

35:41.094 --> 35:43.474
I just want to know why?

35:44.822 --> 35:47.021
I'm 32 years old,

35:47.021 --> 35:49.395
and my career hasn't even started yet.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.783
Danny was gonna
give me my first break.

35:52.783 --> 35:55.443
What was he gonna do, offer
you a part in his next movie?

35:55.443 --> 35:56.858
Yeah.

35:56.858 --> 35:59.399
- How'd you know that?
- The oldest routine out there.

35:59.399 --> 36:02.017
I mean, the guy just wanted you
to do his dirty work for him.

36:02.017 --> 36:05.640
No, Danny said to go get
the camera from the guy.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.247
I didn't know he would crash.

36:16.163 --> 36:18.255
Danny. Hey, Danny cato.

36:18.255 --> 36:20.092
I couldn't let him ruin Danny.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.714
Just like that?

36:30.198 --> 36:31.572
I protect Danny.

36:31.572 --> 36:33.446
It's second nature.

36:33.540 --> 36:35.376
Well, that was dumb move.

36:35.376 --> 36:39.797
'Cause now, what could've been
a tragic accident is now a homicide.

36:40.556 --> 36:42.207
Can I call someone to get bail?

36:42.207 --> 36:43.745
We're not done yet.

36:44.394 --> 36:46.746
Now, is that you or is that him?

36:47.174 --> 36:49.153
It's not me. It's Danny.

36:49.153 --> 36:51.941
- Looks like you.
- That's the point.

36:52.072 --> 36:53.880
I'm his stand-in.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.015
All right, who's the girl?

36:56.140 --> 36:57.441
'Cause we checked with production,

36:57.441 --> 36:59.730
and they didn't send any
stuntwoman over to Danny'S.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.618
I don't know who she is.

37:02.773 --> 37:05.701
Danny goes through a lot of girls.
I live there. I can't keep track.

37:05.701 --> 37:08.723
How about a little time
sitting in a jail cell?

37:08.862 --> 37:10.632
Might jog your memory.

37:20.849 --> 37:24.835
Well, Chloe jackson, female,
white, 26 fits the description.

37:24.835 --> 37:26.930
Looks like the girl in the picture.

37:27.477 --> 37:28.456
Yeah, it does.

37:28.456 --> 37:29.495
Where'd you guys find her?

37:29.495 --> 37:32.678
Canal. Two miles downstream
from Danny cato's house.

37:32.678 --> 37:33.912
We gonna pick him up?

37:33.912 --> 37:38.378
Well, Horatio thinks we've got
only one more bite at the apple.

37:38.517 --> 37:42.108
He wants to wait until he gets
somewhere with that tabloid picture.

37:42.204 --> 37:43.393
All right.

37:43.393 --> 37:44.367
Thanks.

37:44.367 --> 37:45.761
You got it.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.669
We still can't positively
ID the shooter.

37:48.669 --> 37:51.935
Sorry, this is as good
as it gets with analog.

37:52.324 --> 37:53.830
What about digital?

37:53.830 --> 37:56.552
Anti-aliasing software?

37:56.661 --> 37:59.153
That was my next plan of attack.

37:59.929 --> 38:06.232
Change the image from analog to digital
gives us 256 shades on a gray scale.

38:06.232 --> 38:08.898
The human eye can only see 30 to 50.

38:08.898 --> 38:10.665
This program tricks the eye.

38:10.665 --> 38:12.038
It looks worse.

38:12.038 --> 38:14.115
Yeah, up close it does,

38:14.115 --> 38:16.211
but when you zoom out...

38:16.490 --> 38:18.431
That looks like Danny cato.
What do you think?

38:18.431 --> 38:19.342
Yeah.

38:19.342 --> 38:22.552
Okay, it's still grainy, but
here's what we want to do.

38:22.552 --> 38:24.156
Zoom in on that hand.

38:24.156 --> 38:26.096
His hand? / Mm-hmm.

38:30.666 --> 38:32.240
There's something on the back of it.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.500
Yes, there is.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.427
Could I have a copy of this, please?

38:36.950 --> 38:40.357
You pulled me out of a camera
test for this. Better be good.

38:41.028 --> 38:42.743
This...

38:42.743 --> 38:44.987
is a photograph

38:44.987 --> 38:48.931
of you shooting Chloe jackson.

38:49.045 --> 38:51.060
Really? / Mm-hmm.

38:53.241 --> 38:54.499
No.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.872
That's my stand-in, Gabe.

38:56.924 --> 39:02.264
You see, in my business, stand-ins
are visually interchangeable.

39:04.155 --> 39:06.013
I guess the difference, though,

39:06.120 --> 39:09.039
with Gabe and you is that gabe

39:09.039 --> 39:12.589
doesn't have a cut on the
back of his hand, does he?

39:12.589 --> 39:14.480
Neither do I. / No?

39:15.362 --> 39:20.926
You told me that recently you sustained a cut on
your hand during swordplay with a stuntman.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.844
- Wasn't that it?
- Superficial wound.

39:22.844 --> 39:24.656
Really? / Yeah.

39:24.766 --> 39:28.286
You see any cut on my hands? Huh?

39:28.286 --> 39:29.366
May I?

39:29.366 --> 39:31.280
May you?

39:32.919 --> 39:34.866
Relax.

39:46.072 --> 39:48.161
Gee, what do you call that?

39:50.651 --> 39:52.617
Sit down.

39:57.249 --> 39:58.290
No!

39:58.290 --> 40:00.358
What? I'm not gonna pay you!

40:00.358 --> 40:02.286
You're lucky I let you stay!

40:37.411 --> 40:39.122
Brad tustin heard it,

40:39.122 --> 40:41.588
Jerry dorfman photographed it,

40:41.588 --> 40:45.824
and now you are gonna
go away for it.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.535
Lieutenant. / Yeah?

40:49.620 --> 40:52.004
There's still one big
hurdle ahead of you.

40:52.004 --> 40:53.509
What would that be?

40:53.509 --> 40:54.654
The jury.

40:54.654 --> 40:58.846
I'm a star, kemosabe. I can
convince 12 people of anything.

40:59.344 --> 41:02.946
You haven't convinced me, my friend,

41:02.946 --> 41:05.964
and that is not a good start.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.711
Excuse me, lieutenant, uh,

42:04.711 --> 42:06.876
you cracked the Danny cato case?

42:07.120 --> 42:09.235
Actually,

42:09.235 --> 42:10.659
it was my team.

42:10.659 --> 42:13.268
Can I get a couple of pictures
of you for the herald?

42:13.268 --> 42:15.142
A few head shots, maybe a wide?

42:15.142 --> 42:17.826
And could you show your badge?
people love that.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.213
No.
