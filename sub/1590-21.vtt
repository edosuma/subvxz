The magical properties of this
spell will only have lasting

00:05.406 --> 00:07.106

00:07.108 --> 00:10.275
No! Rainbow dash!
Ha ha ha!

00:10.277 --> 00:13.412
How in equestria does
that pony expect to pass

00:13.414 --> 00:15.047
Her history of the
wonderbolts exam tomorrow

00:15.049 --> 00:16.415
If she's wasting time flying?

00:17.384 --> 00:19.284
I'm just gonna fly
right up to her

00:19.286 --> 00:20.586
And tell her what I think

00:20.588 --> 00:22.388
About her lackadaisical
approach to studying.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.756
Won't she be surprised.

00:23.758 --> 00:24.690
Surprise!

00:24.692 --> 00:26.492
What? Huh?
How did you?

00:26.494 --> 00:27.793
Please, twilight.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.129
That was the worst
sneak attack ever.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.800
I saw you giving me the
stink eye from the ground.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.370
And heard you flying towards me
and muttering from a mile away.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.539
Well, if you heard me
muttering then you must know

00:40.541 --> 00:41.807
What I was muttering about.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.309
Yeah, yeah, the
wonderbolts history test.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.344
No big deal.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.680
No. Big deal.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.782
Really big
deal.

00:49.784 --> 00:53.052
A test that will
determine if you can join

00:53.054 --> 00:54.486
The newly formed
wonderbolts reserves.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.121
And being part of the
wonderbolts reserves

00:56.123 --> 00:57.322
Means you'll have
the opportunity

00:57.324 --> 00:58.791
To live your dream
as a wonderbolt.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.393
This is the most important
test of your life!

01:01.395 --> 01:04.129
Twilight, not everypony
gets all freaked out

01:04.131 --> 01:05.798
About tests like you.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.101
I do not get all
freaked out about tests.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.170
Uh, seriously?

01:11.172 --> 01:14.273
Your freak-outs are so epic you
sing whole "freak-out" arias

01:14.275 --> 01:19.778
Fine. I may tend to take my
tests a little seriously.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.581
But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't be studying for yours.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.086
Oooh! And I know just the

Into here?

02:31.318 --> 02:35.187
With my handy dandy study
checklist, of course.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.388
Of course.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.224
First up: Reading
and highlighting.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.594
Reading and highlighting
is the foundation

02:42.596 --> 02:43.896
Of any good study method.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.665
It allows the student to
hone in and boil down

02:46.667 --> 02:48.167
What's really important,

02:48.169 --> 02:49.935
Separating the
good from the bad,

Um...

02:56.243 --> 02:57.609
Huh?

02:57.611 --> 03:00.379
By highlighting everything,
you don't really

03:00.381 --> 03:02.948
Separate the wheat
from the chaff.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.786
Or the good from the bad.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.556
Hey. I am not that tall!

03:10.558 --> 03:12.257
<i>(chuckle)</i>

03:14.828 --> 03:19.298
Clearly reading and highlighting
is not your style of studying.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.466
<i>So let's move on to</i>
<i>the tried and true.</i>

03:22.402 --> 03:23.735
History lecture!

03:26.639 --> 03:28.407
Yes, rainbow?

03:28.409 --> 03:29.808
Is it snack time?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.243
No.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.544
Recess?

03:32.546 --> 03:36.548
Can't we just watch the history
of the wonderbolts movie?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.517
No!

03:38.519 --> 03:41.853
Now just get comfortable
and experience...

03:41.855 --> 03:43.722
The magic of learning.

03:45.292 --> 03:48.727
Prior to the great
celestia/luna rift,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.863
There was no need for the
earth, unicorn, pegasi,

03:51.865 --> 03:53.732
Or e.U.P.--Guard.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.733

So highly charged, that magical
lightning showered down

04:19.593 --> 04:23.695
<i>Everypony was so filled</i>

them the wonderbolts.

style of learning: Flashcards.

05:12.712 --> 05:16.615
Ooh! Does that mean
I'll learn in a flash?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.717
One can only hope.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.689
Colonel purple dart, the leader
of the wonderbolts in the

05:23.691 --> 05:25.090
4th celestial era was
known for his...

05:29.897 --> 05:34.833
What? No! I was riveted by
your captivating cards.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.868
Hmmmm.

official flying squadron

05:38.939 --> 05:41.073

honored them with...

05:46.446 --> 05:49.047
The original wonderbolts
lightning bolt insignia was...

05:49.049 --> 05:50.115
Ah!

05:51.084 --> 05:52.084
Rainbow dash.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.919
You could have hurt me.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.555

05:56.557 --> 05:59.124
A spit wad to the eye would
have been no laughing matter.

Well, if you can horse
around like this,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.831

be ready for the test.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.817
Celestia's cereal

06:25.819 --> 06:29.087

07:21.475 --> 07:22.808
Maybe your famous

07:24.445 --> 07:25.610

able to properly represent them

08:04.818 --> 08:07.619

history and can fly.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.003
Maybe I should
become a wonderbolt.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.639
Just 'cause you've got wings
doesn't mean you can fly.
