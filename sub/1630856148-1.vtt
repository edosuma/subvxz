Good morning, Dayton, Ohio,
and welcome to Channel 71 News.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.694
I'm Avery Quinn.
In our top story,

00:28.778 --> 00:29.946
former mayor
Hewitt Vance,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.114
continues to defend against accusations

00:32.198 --> 00:34.700
of corruption with his
Christmas Care Foundation as--

00:34.784 --> 00:37.662
<i>Avery! We need that story!
We're on in five!</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:41.374
Sorry. Right. It's on its way
to the prompter now.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.674
Center frame.
Can you pan camera left?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.262
Okay, center...

00:54.346 --> 00:56.180
Good morning, Dayton.
I'm Misty McAllen.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.765
And I'm Bink Binkerson.

00:57.849 --> 01:02.144
This is Channel 71 News
at 5:00 AM for December 23rd!

01:02.228 --> 01:04.480
In our top story,
former mayor Hewitt Vance

01:04.564 --> 01:07.191
continues to defend against
accusations of corruption

01:07.275 --> 01:09.360
with his
Christmas Care Foundation

01:09.444 --> 01:11.529
as his one-time right-hand man

01:11.613 --> 01:13.698
claims the former mayor
is using foundation funds

01:13.782 --> 01:15.700
for personal use.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.368
I'm 100% innocent.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.287
Peter Mayhew is a disgruntled ex-employee

01:19.371 --> 01:21.539
who loves a good conspiracy theory.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.541
Mayhew continues to allege
that the former mayor

01:23.625 --> 01:25.585
holds two sets of accounting records,

01:25.669 --> 01:27.712
despite the fact that
an ongoing investigation

01:27.796 --> 01:29.631
has produced no evidence to date.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.967
Have you heard anything?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.802
Nancy wants to see me after the show.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.387
They're gonna give it to you.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.306
You're Sophie Ashburn's
daughter. It's in your DNA.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.766
No, I don't wanna use that.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.644
All my mom talks about is how
she did it all on her own.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.646
I want to do that, too.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.400
Well, I think you'll make
a great weekend anchor.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.153
And there's no doubt you can
report circles around these two.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.238
And in lighter news,
coming up after the break,

01:54.322 --> 01:57.575
a penguin has fallen in love
with a chihuahua?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.202
Did you write that?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.871
I can't wait for this story.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.873
It's a Christmas miracle.
Stay tuned!

02:10.171 --> 02:11.672
They don't think you're ready.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.215
Oh, right to it then.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.259
You're right.
I'm sorry.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.136
I-I mean,
I know I stumbled through

02:17.220 --> 02:20.431
a few words in my audition,
but I can do this, Nancy.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.850
I'm sure you can,
but it's not my decision.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.226
I was nervous.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.604
I mean, I would've had it
on the next take.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.732
There are no second takes in the news.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.402
Look, maybe they're unfairly
comparing you to your mother--

02:33.486 --> 02:34.779
My mother?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.572
She wasn't immediately the
legend that she is now.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.366
It took her time to find her voice.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.201
And I can find mine.
I just need--

02:40.285 --> 02:41.869
I just need one more shot.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.540
I'm not gonna say never,
but I can't give it to you now.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.459
Look, you're the best
researcher we've got.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.711
We would all hate to lose you over this.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.755
You won't lose me over this.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.384
I mean, at least not until
<i>60 Minutes</i> recruits me.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.135
But I will change their minds.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.597
I will find a story that only I can tell.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.808
I will be an anchor.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.486
Oh, I just heard.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.614
Thank you.
You know, I--

03:18.698 --> 03:20.157
I don't think they were ever really

03:20.241 --> 03:22.076
gonna give it to me anyway.
I mean, it was just like

03:22.160 --> 03:24.996
a pity audition for Sophie Ashburn's kid.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.165
You remind me a lot of myself
when I was first starting out.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.002
Back when I was still mousy
little Misty Cornfoot.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.754
And that was two nose jobs ago.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.381
Thank you...

03:35.465 --> 03:36.591
I think?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.342
And I mean,
I know I'm not my mom.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.844
Of course not, but she's been reporting

03:39.928 --> 03:41.429
for 33 years, you know?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.556
I'm sure she wasn't perfect
when she started either.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.601
Can I be honest, here?
You have big shoes to fill,

03:46.685 --> 03:48.644
and there's no getting around that,

03:48.728 --> 03:53.065
so you need to start dressing
for the job that you want,

03:53.149 --> 03:55.735
not the job that you already have.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.945
It's not what's on the inside that counts,

03:58.029 --> 04:01.366
but what's on the outside.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.200
That goes against every self-help lecture

04:03.284 --> 04:04.827
I've ever heard.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.621
But it's true.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.791
And a little anchor to
future anchor advice...

04:12.252 --> 04:17.048
Infrared light therapy masks.
Use it.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.052
It's what keeps us looking
like we're still in college.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.102
- Wow.
- You were here?

04:30.186 --> 04:31.395
You could've saved me from that.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.440
- I knew she got her nose done!
- Twice.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.278
You know she's got a point.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.947
You need to make them notice you, Avery.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.907
You know what I always say,
the squeaky wheel--

04:42.991 --> 04:46.453
- Is annoying and obnoxious.
- And is necessary to get ahead.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.123
Can I just be honest with you?

04:51.207 --> 04:55.628
Anchor to future anchor advice.

04:55.712 --> 04:59.341
- Infrared light therapy.
- Ugh!

04:59.966 --> 05:03.511
- Go and make coffee.
- I don't know how to squeak.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.347
<i>You'll figure it out!</i>

05:15.440 --> 05:17.984
- Hey, Bec!
- Hey!

05:18.068 --> 05:20.278
Merry almost Christmas!

05:20.362 --> 05:22.864
Merry Christmas, Avery!

05:23.406 --> 05:25.950
Have a good night.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.787
<i>It's a dog-eat-dog business, Avery.</i>

05:29.871 --> 05:31.789
<i>And not everybody's cut out for it.</i>

05:31.873 --> 05:34.542
Do you know how many people
came up the ranks with me that

05:34.626 --> 05:37.211
- are now selling real estate?
- Fourteen.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.629
<i>Fourteen.</i>

05:38.713 --> 05:40.631
<i>You've got to get a thicker skin, Avery.</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:42.800
<i>Otherwise, they'll just eat you alive.</i>

05:42.884 --> 05:46.095
I got a thousand no's
before I got my first yes.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.430
Do you think
I let that break me?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.015
No, you did not.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.685
Oh, by the way, daddy and I
bought you some presents.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.645
They should be there tomorrow.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.814
<i>And I got him that meat smoker
that he wanted.</i>

05:56.898 --> 05:58.399
<i>Should I put your name on the card?</i>

05:58.483 --> 06:01.360
Oh, no thank you.
I sent you guys your presents.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.070
I think they should be there tomorrow.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.615
Okay.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.783
He's devastated, you know,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.077
that you're not going to
be here with us for Christmas.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.455
<i>It's his favorite time of year.</i>

06:12.539 --> 06:15.333
I know. It sucks for me, too.
But you remember how it is

06:15.417 --> 06:17.209
when you're trying to establish yourself.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.503
We just really miss you is all.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.173
I miss you guys, too.
But we have next year.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.426
Okay. Pull back.
Let me see.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.844
<i>It's just like the outfit that I wore</i>

06:26.928 --> 06:29.555
<i>when I interviewed for
my first national spot.</i>

06:29.639 --> 06:31.432
And I got that job.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.060
Yeah. Misty wears stuff
like this, so I'm hoping that

06:34.144 --> 06:36.270
it will do the trick for me.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.064
You do what you gotta do.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.107
<i>Three more homes
were reportedly hit last night</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:42.860
<i>by the man police have
now dubbed the Santa Crook,</i>

06:42.944 --> 06:45.655
<i>bringing the tally up to eight homes.</i>

06:45.739 --> 06:48.532
<i>He is described as a white male,
mid-thirties,</i>

06:48.616 --> 06:50.910
<i>wearing a Santa Claus suit.</i>

06:50.994 --> 06:52.620
<i>Okay, honey,
I can see you're busy.</i>

06:52.704 --> 06:53.579
<i>Love you, we'll talk tomorrow.</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:55.623
Okay. Love you. Bye.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.583
<i>If anyone has any
information that could help</i>

06:57.667 --> 07:01.337
<i>assist with his capture, please
call the Dayton Metro Police.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:03.047
<i>And in other news--</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:07.969
<i>It's 5:00 AM on this
beautiful Christmas Eve morning.</i>

07:08.053 --> 07:09.887
<i>Welcome back,
Channel 71 viewers.</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:12.390
<i>I'm Bink Binkerson
being joined by Chef Joel.</i>

07:12.474 --> 07:14.100
<i>We are so happy to have you.</i>

07:14.184 --> 07:16.686
<i>And it looks like you've brought
some festive treats for us.</i>

07:17.687 --> 07:19.480
Merry Christmas Eve!

07:19.564 --> 07:21.399
Okay. Did the spirit of Barbara Walters

07:21.483 --> 07:22.858
visit you last night?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.027
My girl's looking like
a real live newscaster.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.862
You think?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.739
Oh, it's so annoying that you
can look this good at 4:00 AM.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.991
I think I'm still asleep.
Can you tell?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.118
- You look great.
- Liar.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.869
<i>Well, I could never
make it look that good,</i>

07:33.953 --> 07:35.830
<i>so thank you for setting
that up as if I made it</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:37.331
<i>because obviously I could
never do that good of a job.</i>

07:41.670 --> 07:43.546
Well, it wouldn't be a
proper Christmas party

07:43.630 --> 07:45.798
without Gary's Spam reindeer.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.717
Tell me about it.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.511
Hey, what's happening over there?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.221
Did you call Detroit?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.764
The anchor's curse.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.434
Laryngitis has taken over
Misty's vocal chords.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.852
- She lost her voice?
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.228
And everyone's out of town
for the holidays,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.730
including Bink,

08:00.814 --> 08:01.981
who's on the first plane out
Christmas morning.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.232
Misty was supposed to do Christmas morning

08:03.316 --> 08:05.151
tomorrow alone.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.902
What are they gonna do?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.155
Well, seeing as how no one can
catch a flight back in time--

08:09.239 --> 08:10.865
Call Detroit. They're skilled.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.660
You've got laryngitis.
You can't go on.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.288
I'm perfectly fine.

08:17.372 --> 08:21.167
- What about Florida Sanchez?
- What are you--
- Avery? Avery?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.919
You've got this.
Go get 'em!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.962
I can do it.

08:25.046 --> 08:30.009
Excuse me. I uh, I-I,
I could fill in for Misty.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.803
I understand that you don't
want to give me the weekend job,

08:32.887 --> 08:36.807
but this is just one broadcast,
one very low-rated broadcast.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.476
And you know, it's Christmas morning.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.144
People aren't even paying
attention to the 5:00 AM.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.606
They're opening presents, and
sleeping, and visiting family.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.651
You're nervous. And nervous
people make me nervous.

08:46.735 --> 08:51.739
I promise, I will not let you
or the viewers down.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.200
This means everything to me.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.376
You go on at 5:00 for Misty.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.169
- Do not blow it.
- Thank you!

09:05.253 --> 09:07.172
Yes! Ooh.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.718
You heard the lady.
Don't be late.

09:14.512 --> 09:18.600
- Feel better.
- Thanks. Break a leg.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.190
- Squeak, squeak.
- Holy crap!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.484
Okay, it's supposed to storm tonight.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.819
- Don't let it keep you up.
- Yeah, right.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.404
I'm going to bed like, now.
No under eye bags.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.656
No yawning.
No stammering.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.408
This is going to be the best
Christmas morning broadcast

09:35.492 --> 09:37.451
Channel 71 News has ever seen.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.036
Oh, it's really starting to come down.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.663
You'd better hurry and get home.
I'll see you bright and early.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.581
Lovely.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.041
<i>And speaking of caution,
keep those snow shovels ready.</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:27.376
<i>This storm is just getting started.</i>

10:47.147 --> 10:48.273
What's that?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.811
No, no, no.
This is not happening tonight.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.355
You can rob me any night but tonight!

11:31.441 --> 11:32.817
<i>We're sorry.</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:34.443
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:36.654
Oh, you are so not sorry.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.907
I need a landline and a Doberman.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.121
Are you...

11:54.673 --> 11:56.508
Okay...

11:58.885 --> 12:00.261
<i>We're sorry.</i>

12:00.345 --> 12:02.389
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:09.145
No, Dasher. No.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.694
Don't move! You are
under citizen's arrest!

12:16.778 --> 12:18.321
The police are on their way!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.781
Why are you up?
I followed all the procedures.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.700
- The what?
- This wasn't supposed to happen.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.160
You breaking into my house
and getting caught?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.745
No. That wasn't supposed to happen!

12:25.829 --> 12:29.874
I didn't break in.
I came in the regular way.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.876
- But something was off.
- The lights?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.754
- And your thieving skills?
- Wait. How long was I out?

12:34.838 --> 12:36.464
I don't know.
Like, 10 minutes.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.257
Ten minutes?
I've gotta go.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.093
No! The only place you
are going, sir, is to jail.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.889
To ja-- Oh, no. There has been
a misunderstanding.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.558
Why do I keep choking tonight?

12:47.642 --> 12:50.603
- Oh. Are they still here?
- Who?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.896
My dad is going to be so upset.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.023
And you do not want to upset my dad.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.442
Your dad is in on this?
What are you, mafia?

12:56.526 --> 13:00.613
Mafia? No!
I am not mafia.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.741
I'm Santa Claus.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.410
You know, jolly old Saint Nick?

13:06.494 --> 13:09.288
The big guy in the red pajamas
with the ho, ho, ho.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.456
Oh.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.124
Yeah, that's a work in progress.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.918
Okay. You're Santa.
I'm the Tooth Fairy.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.338
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
I've met the--

13:16.796 --> 13:18.256
- This isn't a joke.
- I'm not laughing.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.757
I have a very crucial day tomorrow,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.509
so you messed with the wrong girl.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.802
I'm sorry.
You have a crucial day?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.887
You have a crucial day?
It is Christmas Eve,

13:24.971 --> 13:26.264
late on Christmas Eve.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.849
And I still have not finished my rounds.

13:28.933 --> 13:33.521
Okay, okay. Whew. You and I
got off on the wrong foot,

13:33.605 --> 13:37.817
so maybe you could just untie me
and I'll get on my way.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.527
Absolutely not.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.947
Okay, fine.
I'm very strong.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.324
I will break out of this.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.576
I will break out of this
right in front of you

13:47.660 --> 13:50.372
and I'll just--

13:52.832 --> 13:55.001
Wow, this is surprisingly strong garland.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.128
It's wired for extra molding capabilities.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.547
Oh, that's very, very convenient.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.966
- Maybe you can unwire it for me?
- No!

14:02.050 --> 14:04.760
I'm not gonna let you go
rob more innocent people.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.637
Unlike you,
I care about my fellow man.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.139
I'm sure you care about your fellow man,

14:08.223 --> 14:10.099
especially the ones
that you aren't tying up.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.477
But this is a very important
night and I really have got--

14:13.561 --> 14:15.313
Okay. Wait. You know what?
Maybe I'll just check the time.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.816
I could have lots of time.
I've just gotta check my watch.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.234
- Here, if I could--
- Pretty cool watch.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.154
Thank you. It's got latitude
and longitude indicators

14:23.238 --> 14:25.823
for traveling at high velocities
over hemispheres.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.158
The reindeer have a very
good sense of direction,

14:27.242 --> 14:32.288
but this really helps.
Whoa. Wow! It is 11:22.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.749
Sunrise is at 6:00 AM and
I still haven't even started

14:34.833 --> 14:36.083
delivering gifts to the
western hemisphere.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.337
I am so far behind schedule.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.172
Wow, you are really taking it
all the way with this.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.049
Whoa! What was that?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.968
- No--
- Hey! Hey!

14:46.052 --> 14:48.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

14:49.347 --> 14:51.599
What?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.309
They're gone.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.020
Who? Who?
Are there people on my roof?

14:56.104 --> 14:58.105
This hasn't happened in 188 years.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.067
Do you have any idea what you have done?

15:01.151 --> 15:03.819
What I have done?
You broke into my house,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.446
and tonight of all nights.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.074
By doing that you just
jeopardized my career!

15:08.158 --> 15:12.495
You have tied up Santa Claus,
thereby jeopardizing Christmas!

15:16.499 --> 15:19.418
We have been over this a dozen times.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.213
I'm telling you the truth.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.799
Also, do you have any milk
or cookies? I am so hungry.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.217
Enough with the act.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.718
We've been following you
on the news for a week.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.428
You dress in a Santa suit,
break into people's houses,

15:29.512 --> 15:30.930
and empty their safes.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.974
Yes, I go into people's homes,
but I do not do any of

15:33.058 --> 15:37.270
that other stuff. I brought you
your gift, by the way.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.980
You're welcome.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.234
Uh, Becca's my neighbor.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.860
- Becca's your neighbor?
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.238
There's no Becca here?
You're not Becca?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.824
Are you sure? Becca.
You're serious?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.242
Mm-hmm.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.328
Oh. Why does this keep happening tonight?

15:54.412 --> 15:57.206
Also, you kind of look like
you could be a model.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.916
And I'm supposed to believe
that you're Santa?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.086
Oh. Well, thank you for the compliment.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.714
And so you know, the Santa Claus
has not looked like

16:04.798 --> 16:08.509
the proverbial Father Christmas
in quite some time.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.636
And also, this is my first
time doing the rounds.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.763
- Or attempting to.
- Okay.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.432
And failing miserably.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.851
Oh, give it up!

16:16.935 --> 16:19.145
If I wasn't really Santa Claus,
how would I know that your name

16:19.229 --> 16:21.522
is...

16:21.606 --> 16:24.609
Avery Quinn?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.736
Because you're not only a thief,
but also a stalker.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.446
- I'm neither of those things.
- Okay.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.823
If you are the real Santa,
then you're supposed to know

16:30.907 --> 16:32.950
when I've been bad and good, right?

16:33.034 --> 16:35.244
Let's hear it.
When have I been bad?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.163
- That is something that I know.
- You should.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.164
- Okay.
- Let's hear it.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.291
I'm thinking. You...

16:40.375 --> 16:42.293
You have a number of
late-return library books.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.377
Oh, come on.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.795
Okay. You sometimes bite your nails.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.130
Who doesn't?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.757
You didn't floss your teeth last night.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.717
That is not true!

16:49.801 --> 16:51.177
Who flosses every single night?

16:51.261 --> 16:52.803
- Is that an admission of guilt?
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.472
Also, if you're gonna go with
the whole I'm Santa thing,

16:54.556 --> 16:58.017
- do better.
- Fine. Yes, I know.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.353
Okay, here's the truth.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.647
The intel is supposed to
transfer to the new Santa,

17:02.731 --> 17:07.234
but for whatever reason, I'm
not connecting in full force.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.820
Oh, maybe my dad was right.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.364
It's one thing to wear the boots,

17:11.448 --> 17:14.367
but you have to own the boots.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.161
Let's not do a therapy session
right now, though.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.830
What if you could complete
the most important task

17:19.914 --> 17:21.582
in your life?

17:21.666 --> 17:24.168
Robbing my neighbors is the most
important thing of your life?

17:24.252 --> 17:27.380
- Honestly, I pity you.
- I didn't rob your neighbors.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.173
Becca's gonna wake up on
Christmas morning.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.883
She's gonna go downstairs
and she's gonna look for

17:30.967 --> 17:32.677
the one thing she asked for for Christmas

17:32.761 --> 17:35.471
and it's not gonna be there,
an organic chemistry kit.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.890
You opened it?
How do you sleep at night?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.393
I didn't open it!
I made--

17:40.477 --> 17:43.646
Okay. You know what?
Pfft.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.523
What difference does it make
whether or not I'm returning

17:45.607 --> 17:49.026
the gift or bringing her
the gift for the first time?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.487
The most important thing
is that Becca gets her gift.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.739
And you are the only person
that is preventing that

17:53.823 --> 17:55.324
from happening.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.412
So what do you say?
Bring Becca her gift.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.627
You want me to go with you over there?

18:06.711 --> 18:07.753
- Yes.
- Right now.

18:07.837 --> 18:08.546
- Yes.
- And bring the gift?

18:08.630 --> 18:09.714
Uh-huh.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.008
Fine.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.760
I'm going to put pants on.
You better not move.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.178
- Stay right there.
- Fine.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.389
- Don't move.
- Of course.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.974
Elf's honor.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.770
Yes, it's bad news.
I lost contact with Chris.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.106
<i>What do you mean you lost contact?</i>

18:27.190 --> 18:29.984
We almost got caught by
the security patrol and-and

18:30.068 --> 18:31.235
there were so many potential onlookers

18:31.319 --> 18:34.155
I had to leave him inside.
And now um...

18:34.239 --> 18:36.198
- He's off grid.
- <i>Off the what?</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:39.076
<i>Dillon!
I can't report back with that!</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:40.578
Yeah, I'm freaking out here!

18:40.662 --> 18:42.246
It's my first Christmas
as the right-hand man,

18:42.330 --> 18:44.081
and I'm neither to the right
nor by the man!

18:44.165 --> 18:47.752
<i>Look, just breathe.</i>

18:47.836 --> 18:50.171
<i>He has his phone, right?</i>

18:50.255 --> 18:53.674
Yeah, it's just the cell
reception is pretty bad

18:53.758 --> 18:55.217
because of the storm.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.886
<i>Keep trying to establish contact.</i>

18:56.970 --> 18:59.388
<i>And if you can't reach him,
go back to that last house.</i>

18:59.472 --> 19:01.682
<i>He's gotta still be there.
You got it?</i>

19:01.766 --> 19:03.643
Okay, but...

19:05.228 --> 19:08.857
You didn't have to hang up!
But sure.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.110
Oh, oh, my phone!

19:13.194 --> 19:14.946
Haven't known you long, but that ring tone

19:15.030 --> 19:16.697
is pretty on brand.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.407
Yeah, if you could just answer
it? It's in my jacket pocket.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.914
- A flip phone?
- Yeah. Latest model.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.290
Just open it.
Just answer it.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.377
They will tell you exactly who I am.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.380
Wh--why did you do that?

19:32.464 --> 19:34.006
I'm not letting you get in touch
with your accomplices.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.174
Although, you did just have service.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.635
Yes, because it's the latest model!

19:37.719 --> 19:39.929
What?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.180
I can't even get on my cell phone.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.392
How am I supposed to get on the news?

19:45.185 --> 19:49.981
The news. The news.
Oh. Oh, that is gonna work.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.691
A story only I can tell.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.567
Wait. Where are you going?

19:53.651 --> 19:54.694
Avery?

19:54.778 --> 19:58.990
Broke in, 11:05 or so...

19:59.908 --> 20:02.910
- What are you doing?
- Claims to be the real Santa.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.870
Terrible liar, possibly delusional.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.330
Delusional?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.541
Nancy's gonna have to take notice

20:08.625 --> 20:10.668
when I'm the one that's
caught the Santa Crook.

20:10.752 --> 20:15.631
I am not the Santa Crook.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.675
I can see the look on
my dad's face right now.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.510
Uh...

20:19.594 --> 20:21.513
Are you okay?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.806
I don't know.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.808
I'm gonna be the guy
that messed it all up.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.060
Okay.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.354
So here's the deal, Santa Claus.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.690
Cell towers are down
because of this stupid storm,

20:32.774 --> 20:36.527
so we are gonna go to Becca's
house and return her gift.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.904
Because you said, "Elf's honor, right?"

20:38.988 --> 20:40.489
- Elf's honor.
- Good.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.409
And then I'm sorry about this,
but clearly,

20:43.493 --> 20:45.244
you have a lot of family issues
that you need to work through

20:45.328 --> 20:46.787
that have brought you to this point.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.664
I'm gonna have to take you
to the police station myself.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.459
Wait. You said the police were
on their way already.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.420
You lied.

20:54.504 --> 20:55.880
That makes two of us.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.466
I didn't lie.
I'm Santa Claus.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.135
Sure you are. Let's go.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.188
I do not look like that.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.864
Really?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.407
How'd that work out for you?

21:23.491 --> 21:25.493
Could you help me up?

21:30.206 --> 21:32.083
- Oh.
- Jeez.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.089
Thank you.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.050
Don't mention it.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.348
So what's this important thing
that you have to do tomorrow?

21:47.432 --> 21:50.059
Why don't we skip the
small talk, fake Santa?

21:50.143 --> 21:53.938
I'm just trying to be polite.
It's Chris, by the way.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.066
Well, Chris, it's just what I've
worked my entire career for.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.985
I finally get to report the news,

21:59.069 --> 22:00.278
but instead of resting up,

22:00.362 --> 22:02.113
I'm returning a stolen chemistry kit.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.991
Report the news?
You're an anchor,

22:05.075 --> 22:07.368
like Sophie Ashburn?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.120
What do you know about Sophie Ashburn?

22:09.204 --> 22:11.831
- Well, I have a TV.
- Steal that, too?

22:11.915 --> 22:14.542
That gift is not stolen.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.670
It is the gift that Becca
asked for explicitly.

22:17.754 --> 22:21.507
Okay. Ha. Okay.
If you're really Santa,

22:21.591 --> 22:25.303
what is the most meaningful
present I've been given?

22:25.387 --> 22:28.598
Okay, like I said,
my Santa skills are kind of

22:28.682 --> 22:30.308
waning at the moment.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.685
<i>Yeah, of course they are.</i>

22:33.311 --> 22:34.687
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.023
Actually, I'm getting
an image of something.

22:37.107 --> 22:41.110
It's a diary of some kind.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.863
Pretty close, but what teenage
girl doesn't get a diary?

22:43.947 --> 22:47.700
Well, it'll fully come to me
at some point, but...

22:47.784 --> 22:51.912
Whatever it is, I know it was
great because I know for a fact

22:51.996 --> 22:54.081
that you're a good person.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.333
Flattery will get you nowhere.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.792
It's not flattery.

22:56.876 --> 23:01.131
It's a fact coming directly
to you from Santa Claus.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.593
Why are all the hot ones crazy?

23:13.935 --> 23:15.269
You know what? They're probably
at midnight mass.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.646
They go every year, so just leave it here.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.981
Oh, no. There is a protocol.
There is a protocol.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.318
Gifts cannot be left in
unprotected places,

23:22.402 --> 23:24.987
i.e., mailboxes, curbs or stoops, so...

23:25.071 --> 23:27.198
Oh, so you work for Amazon.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.408
This is what I do and
I take my job very seriously.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.661
We need to go inside and
tuck it underneath the tree.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.955
I'm not doing that. I'll just
bring it to Becca tomorrow.

23:34.039 --> 23:39.461
No. No, not tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Christmas and...

23:39.753 --> 23:43.172
Avery, I truly believe this.

23:43.256 --> 23:47.426
Good people deserve good things.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.637
If Becca doesn't get that gift,

23:52.515 --> 23:55.142
it would break my heart.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.103
Uh.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.272
Fine.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.731
What's your plan?

24:00.815 --> 24:03.567
- I have a special set of keys.
- No chimney?

24:03.651 --> 24:04.819
It only works when the
reindeers are on the roof.

24:04.903 --> 24:06.529
The keys are a back-up protocol.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.656
So if you wanna look in my pocket here...

24:13.953 --> 24:14.996
Ah.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.831
What are you, a janitor?

24:16.915 --> 24:21.628
Okay. Here we are.
North America.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.801
I wanna see this.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.680
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't look.
It's not how it works.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.098
Very good.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.485
Okay. If you'd put that back in my pocket

24:46.569 --> 24:48.988
and pick up the gift,
and we can head on inside.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.786
I'm not gonna go in there
because that's trespassing.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.496
Well, I can't carry the gift
because I am tied up,

24:57.580 --> 25:01.042
unless you wanna untie me.

25:01.126 --> 25:04.671
Fine.

25:10.468 --> 25:11.844
Technically, this is
breaking and entering,

25:11.928 --> 25:14.221
which is two years
for a first-time offender.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.182
Though I have my doubts
this is your first offense.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.225
Yes.

25:18.309 --> 25:21.020
What are you doing?

25:21.104 --> 25:22.521
The cravings are real.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.065
And Becca expects there
to be a bite taken out of

25:24.149 --> 25:25.984
the cookie when she
wakes up in the morning.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.944
Mm.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.697
I love milk.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.698
If you could...

25:32.782 --> 25:35.201
Oh, shoot.
I'm making a mess.

25:35.785 --> 25:39.330
If you could maybe help me.
Thank you. Okay. Okay.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.125
There you go. There you go.
You're fine.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.293
You have committed enough
crimes for one night.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.753
Okay.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.880
And I have a 4:00 AM call time.
Let's go.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.008
Okay. Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.473
Okay, think about this.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.977
If you bring me in, the police
might question you for hours.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.896
You could be stuck there until noon.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.398
Well, then I will drop you off

26:05.482 --> 26:06.899
and tell them
I'll come back later.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.693
Wait, do you really think
they're gonna let you do that?

26:08.777 --> 26:10.611
Look, I am not letting you go,
so stop trying to play me.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.364
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.241
Halt! Dayton Alarm Co!
Freeze!

26:15.325 --> 26:16.492
Oh, oh.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.952
Hold it right there,
Santa Crook!

26:19.996 --> 26:21.706
This is security guard tango-nine-niner

26:21.790 --> 26:24.166
standing in front of 417
Kovar Lane, the MacGregor house.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.419
Silent alarm was tripped.
Perps are out front.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.004
Could you?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.755
Hi. I have been trying
to call the cops all night.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.090
I am very grateful that you're here.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.968
I caught the Santa Crook.
He broke into my house.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.886
- You live there?
- No, I live there.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.139
- So you're not a MacGregor?
- No, I'm not.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.391
Then why were you just
exiting the MacGregor house?

26:40.475 --> 26:41.767
I can explain that.

26:41.851 --> 26:44.186
I found him in my living room,
so I tied him up

26:44.270 --> 26:45.896
and I was taking him to the
police station, but then--

26:45.980 --> 26:47.523
You tied him up to take him to the police,

26:47.607 --> 26:49.483
but you broke into the
MacGregor house first?

26:49.567 --> 26:52.570
Uh, I know how this looks,
but, but he's the one you want.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.071
Please, have at him.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.573
Throwing your partner under the bus?

26:55.657 --> 26:57.074
Is there really no honor among thieves?

26:57.158 --> 27:00.745
- Right?
- He is not my partner!

27:00.829 --> 27:02.788
Please, I promise.
I'm a victim.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.790
He's the one you want.
Take him away.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.167
I gotta go to bed.

27:06.251 --> 27:07.585
I don't think you'll be getting much sleep

27:07.669 --> 27:09.211
when you're doing hard time.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.796
Are you arresting me?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.548
I'm an alarm company employee, ma'am.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.425
I do not have that power.

27:14.509 --> 27:16.135
Actually, I'm new.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.553
I hadn't noticed.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.804
But they did give me my own flashlight.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.098
Good for you, Ricky.

27:21.182 --> 27:23.017
Aw, thanks.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.102
But, uh...

27:25.186 --> 27:27.271
That's enough of that.
I've requested back-up

27:27.355 --> 27:28.439
and they should be on their way.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.024
- Oh.
- Oh. I've got it.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.484
Cinnamon.

27:33.069 --> 27:35.488
- It's under there.
- You're really killing it.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.823
It's back by the wheel.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.492
Oh my--
What are you doing?

27:39.576 --> 27:42.036
Saving Christmas!
Are you coming?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.497
You can't just take off in my car!

27:44.581 --> 27:45.665
Don't you leave!
You can't do that!

27:45.749 --> 27:47.500
I'm sorry, Ricky!

27:47.584 --> 27:49.877
No, don't move!
Halt!

27:49.961 --> 27:53.381
By the power invested in me
by my bosses at Dayton Alarm Co,

27:53.465 --> 27:55.258
I order you to halt!

27:55.342 --> 27:58.261
Ohhh! Oh!
Backup is coming!

28:01.181 --> 28:03.433
He's eyeing my plates.
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:04.768 --> 28:06.477
Step on it!

28:06.561 --> 28:09.605
I'm hot pursuit!
They're-they're--

28:09.689 --> 28:12.942
They're in a blue sedan, or white!

28:23.411 --> 28:24.996
Go! Run!

28:25.830 --> 28:28.124
Hey!

28:46.726 --> 28:48.811
Yeah?

28:48.895 --> 28:50.396
<i>My safe has been robbed.</i>

28:50.480 --> 28:51.939
It was the Santa Crook.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.816
He took everything.
The flash drive, everything.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.152
Okay. Leave it to me.
Got it.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.905
Guys, grab the police scanner.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.408
We've got work to do.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.744
<i>Okay.</i>

29:05.120 --> 29:06.495
How is this my life?

29:06.579 --> 29:08.164
I just wanted to take you
to the police station,

29:08.248 --> 29:09.832
get an exclusive story,
and then go back to bed

29:09.916 --> 29:11.834
because I have
to be charming and gregarious

29:11.918 --> 29:13.294
and lovely in the morning!

29:13.378 --> 29:15.963
I'm sorry. You?
I have to be generous and merry,

29:16.047 --> 29:18.382
and international tonight!
Number one rule,

29:18.466 --> 29:19.759
finish before sunrise,

29:19.843 --> 29:21.385
and you're making that very difficult.

29:21.469 --> 29:22.762
You got us into this mess!

29:22.846 --> 29:24.180
You could've let me go an hour ago.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.890
You could be at home in bed
dreaming of sugar plums

29:25.974 --> 29:27.642
and teleprompters.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.852
Oh, my mom! If my mom hears
about how I blew my big break,

29:29.936 --> 29:30.978
I'm never gonna hear the end of it.

29:31.062 --> 29:31.896
It's gonna be every Christmas.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.981
Okay, okay, okay.

29:34.065 --> 29:35.858
Why don't you just let me
get in touch with my people?

29:35.942 --> 29:38.194
You can go home.
It'll be like we never met.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.321
Besides, I don't even know who you are.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.157
Ricky got my plates!

29:43.241 --> 29:44.450
Oh.

29:44.534 --> 29:46.077
<i>Calling all Dayton Alarm carts.</i>

29:46.161 --> 29:47.620
<i>I am at the east end of
Vista Road.</i>

29:47.704 --> 29:49.414
What?

29:51.750 --> 29:53.751
Vista Road?
That's nowhere near here.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.045
That's because they aren't
talking about us.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.507
<i>I repeat.
All cars to Vista Road.</i>

29:59.591 --> 30:02.218
What?

30:02.302 --> 30:04.470
If the Santa Crook
is all the way across town,

30:04.554 --> 30:06.889
who are you?

30:06.973 --> 30:09.517
Do we really have to
go through this again?

30:11.978 --> 30:13.980
Great, there goes that.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.066
What are you looking for?

30:17.150 --> 30:18.734
My phone!
I put it in my pocket.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.195
It must've fallen out.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.823
Okay, you know what?

30:23.907 --> 30:25.241
If you're not the real Santa Crook,

30:25.325 --> 30:28.452
I don't want anything
to do with what this is.

30:28.536 --> 30:29.620
- Wait, Avery!
- No!

30:29.704 --> 30:33.416
Av, Av! Av! Avery! I get--
Avery!

30:33.500 --> 30:34.917
I need to find a phone, call the police,

30:35.001 --> 30:36.627
and go to bed!

30:36.711 --> 30:38.254
Avery!

30:39.339 --> 30:42.008
Avery! I can't--

30:44.678 --> 30:45.886
Avery, wait up!

30:45.970 --> 30:47.597
Hey! Avery, wait up!

30:49.307 --> 30:52.060
I need some help with these.
Avery, please.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.854
Avery, it's Christmas.

30:54.938 --> 30:57.356
Why are you following me?

30:57.440 --> 31:00.068
Because I need you to untie these.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.570
Also, it doesn't feel right
to let you just wander around

31:02.654 --> 31:05.448
in the middle of nowhere.
I wasn't raised that way, so--

31:05.532 --> 31:07.533
Prove it!

31:07.617 --> 31:08.909
Prove what?

31:08.993 --> 31:11.120
Prove that you are who you say you are.

31:11.204 --> 31:13.122
I'm a reporter. I report
facts that I can verify.

31:13.206 --> 31:15.082
So I'd like some verification now!

31:15.166 --> 31:16.959
I don't have to prove anything to you.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.002
- You sure do!
- I don't have to prove

31:18.086 --> 31:19.295
anything to anybody.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.671
Why? You should be able to prove it,

31:20.755 --> 31:21.964
if you are who you say you are.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.090
I can! But you don't seem
very interested--

31:23.174 --> 31:24.467
- Are you afraid?
- I'm not afraid!

31:24.551 --> 31:25.968
Are you afraid because
then you're gonna be liar?

31:26.052 --> 31:28.555
- I am not a liar!
- Then show me who you are!

31:28.930 --> 31:34.310
- Oh, wow.
- What? What just happened?

31:34.394 --> 31:39.815
I just got a flash of insight
about your childhood gift.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.151
- The pivotal one.
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.362
No. Really.
The pivotal gift.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.738
The meaningful one you were asking about.

31:45.822 --> 31:47.907
Every child has the potential
to have a gift that

31:47.991 --> 31:53.204
sets them on their own path.
I just realized what yours was.

31:53.288 --> 31:55.081
You were six or seven.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.916
<i>You were just starting
to get the feel for writing.</i>

31:57.000 --> 32:01.837
<i>It was Christmas morning,
you were opening your gift.</i>

32:01.921 --> 32:04.382
<i>You were with your mom.</i>

32:04.466 --> 32:07.260
<i>It was a leather-bound journal
with the inscription,</i>

32:07.344 --> 32:10.513
<i>"Dig Deeper" on it.</i>

32:18.104 --> 32:20.231
How did you know that?

32:20.315 --> 32:22.525
I mean,
I've been trying to tell you.

32:27.197 --> 32:28.489
Hey. Yeah.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.908
Read me the plates again
from the police scanner.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.869
Someone seems very interested in your car.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.288
That's it.

32:35.372 --> 32:37.374
Yeah, I found the
Quinn woman's car.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.545
Ooh.

32:42.629 --> 32:43.504
Uh, turn around.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.506
Just walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

32:45.590 --> 32:48.217
Slowly, slowly!
Hide the lights! Come on, man.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.927
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

32:55.350 --> 32:59.061
Oh, that's...
That's why he didn't answer!

32:59.145 --> 33:00.688
<i>We're in over our heads here, Dillon.</i>

33:00.772 --> 33:02.940
<i>We have got to tell the big guy.</i>

33:03.024 --> 33:05.651
Understood.
Good luck.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.069
I'll leave that to you.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.154
<i>You lost him, you tell him.</i>

33:09.781 --> 33:12.283
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can't. I can't.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.909
<i>What do you mean you can't?</i>

33:13.993 --> 33:15.578
<i>We have a sacred duty</i>

33:15.662 --> 33:18.122
<i>and those words aren't
part of our job description.</i>

33:18.206 --> 33:20.958
This can't be his first
impression of me on the job.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.586
Okay? Can we just fix this, just us?

33:23.670 --> 33:25.254
<i>Well, we're past that now.</i>

33:25.338 --> 33:27.882
<i>He needs to know and you need to tell him.</i>

33:33.972 --> 33:35.431
Is he going through my car?

33:35.515 --> 33:38.768
My registration is in there.
That has my address on it.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.436
What do they want?

33:40.520 --> 33:42.438
I don't know. Whatever he's
looking for, I don't have it.

33:42.522 --> 33:45.399
But why is he in my car?
What is he looking for?

33:45.483 --> 33:47.568
Wait, I know that guy.
I mean, I don't know him,

33:47.652 --> 33:50.196
know him, but I've seen
his face before in footage.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.781
He was the former head of security

33:51.865 --> 33:53.449
when Vance was the mayor.

33:53.533 --> 33:56.577
He mentioned your license plates
and the police scanner.

33:56.661 --> 33:58.120
Well, if he has a police scanner,

33:58.204 --> 33:59.413
then he would have heard Ricky
call in my plates

33:59.497 --> 34:00.498
as belonging to the Santa Crook.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.458
Why would he have a police scanner?

34:02.542 --> 34:04.335
I need a phone.
I need to get ahold of Talia.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.503
I'll pick up my car tomorrow.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.839
I need to dig into whatever this is.

34:08.923 --> 34:10.466
Maybe they'll have one.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.301
Oh, wait, wait.
Maybe you could untie me.

34:12.385 --> 34:14.220
I can help you figure this out.

34:14.304 --> 34:16.222
I made it pretty clear
I'm not going anywhere.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.682
I'm not letting you do this on your own.

34:17.766 --> 34:21.310
So what do you say?
We'll do this together?

34:21.394 --> 34:22.937
And then I'll finish my rounds.

34:25.732 --> 34:26.983
Thank you.

34:27.067 --> 34:27.984
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sorry, sorry.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.235
I got it. I got it.

34:29.319 --> 34:30.653
- I did a really good job.
- I know you did.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.072
Sorry.

34:32.530 --> 34:33.698
- Hurry, he's coming.
- Sorry, sorry.

34:33.782 --> 34:35.658
Okay, go, go, take your jacket.
Go, go, go!

34:35.742 --> 34:37.326
Okay, okay, okay.

34:37.410 --> 34:38.619
It says the entrance
is over here, come on!

34:38.703 --> 34:40.037
Here we go.
Okay, okay.

34:44.584 --> 34:47.587
Hello. Hey. Excuse me. Do you
have a phone? Are you open?

34:51.091 --> 34:53.760
Who dares to knock?

34:55.261 --> 34:58.931
Your reclamation, then.

34:59.015 --> 35:00.933
Take heed!

35:01.017 --> 35:04.520
Uh, we certainly are taking heed,

35:04.604 --> 35:06.647
but is there any way you have
a phone we could please use?

35:06.731 --> 35:09.943
Yeah. Could we maybe talk to your manager?

35:14.406 --> 35:15.865
We're going in there?

35:15.949 --> 35:16.991
Yeah.

35:17.075 --> 35:19.869
I-I'm not afraid.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.495
To go in there.
Are you?

35:21.579 --> 35:24.415
No, I'm not afraid.
Go ahead.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.584
- Great, here I go.
- Yeah. Okay.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.186
Lights!

35:46.813 --> 35:48.189
Oh, man! Ha!

35:48.273 --> 35:50.399
Did we ever get you!

35:50.483 --> 35:53.778
Sorry, we thought you knew
what you'd walked into.

35:53.862 --> 35:58.783
I'm Lewis Daly, director,
dancer, actor extraordinaire!

35:58.867 --> 36:02.703
Those lines, you would be Marley
from <i>A Christmas Carol</i> !

36:02.787 --> 36:04.705
Welcome to the home dinner theater

36:04.789 --> 36:09.377
of the Dayton, Ohio
Community Players.

36:09.461 --> 36:10.628
You're a theater troupe.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.797
An award-winning theater troupe.

36:12.881 --> 36:16.467
We put on an immersive dinner
experience of Charles Dickens'

36:16.551 --> 36:19.178
<i>A Christmas Carol.</i>
We've won three Tonys for it.

36:19.262 --> 36:20.805
You've won three Tony Awards?

36:20.889 --> 36:24.767
Three Tony's Pizzas. From the
pizza shop down the street.

36:24.851 --> 36:28.521
They give us a free pizza
for every good review we get.

36:28.605 --> 36:31.023
Speaking of which, the show just ended

36:31.107 --> 36:32.650
and the pizza's still warm.

36:32.734 --> 36:34.694
You're welcome to join our wrap party.

36:36.613 --> 36:41.367
Feel free to meet the players.
We've got our Ebenezer Scrooge.

36:41.451 --> 36:45.621
Bob Cratchit.
And of course, Tiny T--Tiny Tim.

36:45.705 --> 36:49.000
Poor guy. He's always typecast.

36:49.459 --> 36:52.837
I love this outfit!
Santa reimagined!

36:52.921 --> 36:54.630
We'll definitely have to talk shop later

36:54.714 --> 36:56.757
about who does your costumes.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.676
- Oh, actually this--
- I'm sorry, if I may?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.428
But do you have a phone that I can use?

37:00.512 --> 37:02.722
The only phone is in the upstairs office

37:02.806 --> 37:05.099
and it's for troupe members only.

37:05.183 --> 37:06.517
Are you serious?

37:06.601 --> 37:08.769
Well, the play is set
in the Victorian era.

37:08.853 --> 37:11.147
We can't just be letting
people in with cell phones.

37:11.231 --> 37:13.524
It would ruin the authenticity.

37:13.608 --> 37:15.693
You're eating Tony's Pizza
from present-day Ohio.

37:15.777 --> 37:18.821
Well, I'm sorry, but it's the
only phone in the building.

37:18.905 --> 37:23.743
And it's Theater Company policy.
Members only.

37:23.827 --> 37:25.369
Then I'd like to become a member.

37:25.453 --> 37:27.705
Oh!

37:27.789 --> 37:29.290
Okay.

37:29.374 --> 37:31.167
You'll just have to pass the audition.

37:31.251 --> 37:32.209
The what?

37:32.293 --> 37:33.544
Well, we have time tonight.

37:33.628 --> 37:37.132
You can audition right now
if you want, huh?

37:39.009 --> 37:43.179
So, how badly do you wanna use that phone?

37:49.477 --> 37:50.603
Are they really making me do this?

37:50.687 --> 37:52.188
It's gonna be okay.

37:52.272 --> 37:53.898
You may not believe in Santa,
but I believe in you.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.191
This is ridiculous.
It's just a phone.

37:55.275 --> 37:56.567
Oh, you've got this.

37:56.651 --> 37:58.235
Just perform a monologue
like they're asking.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.528
Oh, like I have one memorized.

37:59.612 --> 38:01.447
- Improvise one.
- I can't just make one.

38:01.531 --> 38:05.242
- I-I-I-I--
- Ah, we're waiting!

38:05.326 --> 38:06.494
I am right by your side.

38:06.578 --> 38:09.121
Really, I know.
Just dig deep!

38:09.205 --> 38:11.582
Monologue! Monologue!

38:11.666 --> 38:14.043
Would you guys stop that?
Could you please just stop?

38:14.127 --> 38:15.670
- Stop doing that.
- Monologue, monologue!

38:15.754 --> 38:18.173
I said stop right now!

38:20.508 --> 38:23.886
Oh, this has been the most
insane night of my life!

38:23.970 --> 38:26.597
I need to use your phone
because I'm supposed to be

38:26.681 --> 38:28.891
on air at 5:00 AM for Channel 71 News.

38:28.975 --> 38:32.186
And if you only knew how hard
I've worked for this.

38:32.270 --> 38:35.314
I have worked days, weeks, months!

38:35.398 --> 38:36.691
I've given it everything I've got

38:36.775 --> 38:39.777
and if I don't make it, then...

38:39.861 --> 38:42.030
my life is over.

38:42.614 --> 38:45.116
And if it's because of you,

38:45.200 --> 38:49.704
I will come back here
and I will not be pleasant!

38:54.876 --> 38:57.796
Please.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.596
Brilliant!

39:06.680 --> 39:09.473
Absolutely beautiful!

39:09.557 --> 39:12.768
Just magnificent!

39:12.852 --> 39:14.604
Perhaps the most powerful performance

39:14.688 --> 39:16.981
I've seen in this great hall.

39:17.065 --> 39:20.526
Thank you. So you can--you can
use that as my audition, right?

39:20.610 --> 39:23.779
But the truth is, I really--
I really am a reporter.

39:23.863 --> 39:26.157
And I'm about to be on the news very soon.

39:26.241 --> 39:29.827
- What about Misty McAllen?
- She has laryngitis.

39:29.911 --> 39:32.580
Good.
I don't like her smug face.

39:32.664 --> 39:35.458
You have a nice face.

39:35.542 --> 39:36.918
Is that his real accent?

39:37.002 --> 39:39.879
- He likes to stay in character.
- Right. Of course.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.340
Thanks, Tim.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.261
Welcome to the troupe!

39:46.845 --> 39:49.931
Somebody get this girl a Tony!

39:50.265 --> 39:52.183
So I can use the phone?

39:52.892 --> 39:54.602
Ah, yes.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.146
Oh, hi. Thank you.
Thank you.

39:57.230 --> 40:00.275
Oh, this is such an honor.
Really. Oop, sorry!

40:03.528 --> 40:05.821
Make yourself at home, newest member.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.907
Thank you.

40:08.575 --> 40:12.120
Okay, Talia.
Help a sister out.

40:14.247 --> 40:15.957
Love the coat!

40:17.667 --> 40:20.002
Excuse me, sir.

40:20.086 --> 40:23.673
This is going to sound rather bizarre,

40:23.757 --> 40:27.426
but I've been listening to you all night.

40:27.510 --> 40:30.054
And I have this sudden urge

40:30.138 --> 40:34.558
to tell you what I want for Christmas.

40:34.642 --> 40:37.103
That is not bizarre at all.

40:38.980 --> 40:40.439
So...

40:40.523 --> 40:42.150
What do you want for Christmas?

40:47.197 --> 40:48.907
<i>It's Talia!
Leave a message.</i>

41:00.001 --> 41:04.673
You beautiful, old, working computer.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.010
How did you know that?

41:09.094 --> 41:11.596
All those years ago, surethat your parents

41:11.680 --> 41:13.889
couldn't afford it, and sure you doubted

41:13.973 --> 41:15.766
that they would even be okay with it,

41:15.850 --> 41:20.438
but despite all that, you opened the gift.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.607
And there you found

41:22.691 --> 41:24.567
a clipboard,

41:24.651 --> 41:26.694
a pair of dance shoes,

41:26.778 --> 41:31.532
and a copy of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> .

41:31.616 --> 41:33.951
Yes. That's right.

41:34.035 --> 41:37.204
The triple threat.
Directing, dancing, acting.

41:37.288 --> 41:41.459
That was your pivotal gift.
This is who you're meant to be.

41:41.543 --> 41:43.544
Whoa.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.512
Excuse me, everybody.
I have to take a short break.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.644
Hi.

41:59.728 --> 42:02.397
How long have you been standing there?

42:03.523 --> 42:05.817
Long enough.

42:12.198 --> 42:14.575
How'd you do that?

42:14.659 --> 42:16.827
Do what?

42:16.911 --> 42:19.872
Look at them. You've brought
back childhood wonder

42:19.956 --> 42:23.251
to pretty much every member of the troupe.

42:24.627 --> 42:26.379
Are...

42:29.799 --> 42:32.802
Are you really who you say you are?

42:32.886 --> 42:34.804
I haven't lied once.

42:34.888 --> 42:38.641
How? How is this happening?

42:38.725 --> 42:41.435
There is so much mystery in the world.

42:41.519 --> 42:43.479
There is so much we don't
understand about life,

42:43.563 --> 42:45.481
existence and...

42:45.565 --> 42:48.443
And love.

42:50.195 --> 42:52.947
This is too much.

42:53.031 --> 42:54.991
Yeah, you're telling me.

42:55.075 --> 42:59.453
Hey, what'd you find out?

42:59.537 --> 43:02.748
Actually, some information that might

43:02.832 --> 43:05.251
help us both get back on track.

43:05.335 --> 43:07.253
Good.

43:11.299 --> 43:12.967
Okay, so I was able to connect to the

43:13.051 --> 43:17.013
Channel 71 News Police Tracker
and you were right, Santa.

43:17.097 --> 43:19.807
Oh, you don't have to call me Santa.

43:19.891 --> 43:21.267
That's who you are.

43:21.351 --> 43:23.603
Well, I'm glad you get that now,
but call me Chris.

43:23.687 --> 43:25.271
Santa's my dad.

43:25.355 --> 43:26.981
Uh, right. Yeah.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.941
Anyway, so here's the deal.

43:29.025 --> 43:31.193
Seventeen minutes after Ricky
called in my plates,

43:31.277 --> 43:33.821
there was a call from another
residence four blocks east.

43:33.905 --> 43:35.948
A man in a Santa suit
and a female accomplice

43:36.032 --> 43:38.534
stole a flash drive
from a safe on Vista Road.

43:38.618 --> 43:41.245
Vista Road, the real Santa Crooks.

43:41.329 --> 43:42.580
That's right.

43:42.664 --> 43:44.373
- So the former mayor--
- Hewitt Vance.

43:44.457 --> 43:46.792
Hewitt Vance. That's what he's
sending this guy looking for?

43:46.876 --> 43:48.961
- A flash drive?
- Exactly.

43:49.045 --> 43:51.005
And if the police think
that my car belongs to

43:51.089 --> 43:52.965
the real Santa Crook,
finding the flash drive

43:53.049 --> 43:54.550
and returning it,
I can clear my name

43:54.634 --> 43:55.968
and get to the bottom of this.

43:56.052 --> 43:57.470
All while getting you
on the air by 5:00 AM

43:57.554 --> 43:59.639
and having me deliver half
the world their gifts by 6:00.

43:59.723 --> 44:01.140
Easy-peasy.

44:01.224 --> 44:07.022
Okay, so that gives us...
Four and a half hours.

44:08.898 --> 44:11.067
Uh, guys.

44:11.151 --> 44:13.028
I think you should come and look at this.

44:15.488 --> 44:17.531
<i>Despite an exhaustive
manhunt involving several</i>

44:17.615 --> 44:19.742
<i>law enforcement officers,</i>

44:19.826 --> 44:22.286
<i>these fugitives are still at large.</i>

44:22.370 --> 44:24.622
<i>This artist's rendering of the Santa Crook</i>

44:24.706 --> 44:27.333
<i>and his accomplice have been
provided by a local</i>

44:27.417 --> 44:29.585
<i>security company along with
license plates 9-9-9--</i>

44:29.669 --> 44:31.879
I can't believe I'm a
breaking news story at 1:00 AM.

44:31.963 --> 44:34.882
Is my nose really that pronounced?

44:34.966 --> 44:37.260
No. You have a cute nose.

44:37.344 --> 44:39.429
Ahem.

44:40.430 --> 44:43.808
Um, would you believe that
this is just a classic case

44:43.892 --> 44:46.102
of mistaken identity?

44:48.146 --> 44:50.273
We don't judge here.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.149
And if anyone knows about
mistaken identity,

44:52.233 --> 44:53.526
it's me.

44:53.610 --> 44:55.820
As an actor, I can't even
tell you how many times

44:55.904 --> 44:58.197
I've been mistaken for Leo.

44:58.281 --> 44:59.615
DiCaprio?

44:59.699 --> 45:04.328
No. DiGennaro from Tony's Pizza.
He's the delivery guy.

45:04.412 --> 45:07.540
Folks, this is a wrap party,
so let's have some fun!

45:34.859 --> 45:37.987
Yeah.
Yeah, I may have found them.

45:38.071 --> 45:40.573
I'll get back to you.

45:44.494 --> 45:45.911
I've called every cab company in the area

45:45.995 --> 45:47.288
and not a single one is picking up.

45:47.372 --> 45:49.457
We need some way to
track down the real thieves

45:49.541 --> 45:52.209
and find that flash drive.

45:52.293 --> 45:55.338
A couple of Kringle Coolers on the house.

45:55.422 --> 45:57.590
I found some stale chocolate chip cookies.

45:57.674 --> 46:00.885
Oh, wow!
Thank you, Tiny!

46:00.969 --> 46:02.762
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:02.846 --> 46:04.805
What about your team?

46:04.889 --> 46:06.849
I mean, you guys have a pretty
famous method of transportation

46:06.933 --> 46:08.559
that may come in handy.

46:08.643 --> 46:09.769
You're talking about the sleigh.

46:09.853 --> 46:10.728
- Yeah.
- I tried calling them.

46:10.812 --> 46:12.104
They didn't pick up.

46:12.188 --> 46:13.481
They probably didn't recognize the number.

46:13.565 --> 46:14.941
Maybe they'll call back?

46:16.401 --> 46:18.527
- Speak of the devil.
- Oh, I would never.

46:21.072 --> 46:22.114
I just got an idea.

46:22.198 --> 46:25.702
Dayton, Ohio Community Players.

46:30.915 --> 46:33.084
It's for you.

46:38.256 --> 46:44.136
Hello? Oh, Dillon.
Yes, I can explain.

46:44.220 --> 46:47.014
No, no. No, no, no, no.
I do not wanna talk to--

46:47.098 --> 46:49.517
- <i>Christopher?</i>
- Hey, Dad.

46:49.601 --> 46:51.143
<i>Dillon tells me that
things have been rocky.</i>

46:51.227 --> 46:52.812
Yeah, no.
We got off to a bumpy start.

46:52.896 --> 46:55.189
I'm definitely gonna finish.
Yes. Yeah.

46:55.273 --> 46:57.108
<i>I'm not so sure based on what I'm hearing.</i>

46:57.192 --> 47:00.194
No, I-I am. I'm owning it.
I-I--

47:00.278 --> 47:02.238
<i>Perhaps it's best
I take over your post.</i>

47:02.322 --> 47:04.407
No, no, no, you do not need
to come clean it up.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.742
<i>This is your last chance
before I come down there myself.</i>

47:06.826 --> 47:08.703
- Dad, please do not come here.
- <i>Get back to work!</i>

47:08.787 --> 47:10.788
Dad. Dad. Dad?

47:24.636 --> 47:26.805
Hey. Are you okay?

47:27.722 --> 47:30.225
Yeah. Well...

47:30.642 --> 47:32.101
I don't know.

47:32.185 --> 47:34.771
I mean, I-I think so.

47:35.355 --> 47:38.149
You wanna talk about it?

47:38.233 --> 47:41.236
No. I'm okay, really.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.321
So what's all this?

47:43.405 --> 47:45.906
Oh, I mapped the 911 calls
from the past few nights.

47:45.990 --> 47:47.366
And it turns out that
Santa Crook

47:47.450 --> 47:50.161
stayed in the same general area.
They're tract houses,

47:50.245 --> 47:51.537
so I pulled up the development sites.

47:51.621 --> 47:54.206
And every house hit was the same model.

47:54.290 --> 47:57.209
Maybe he's not done for the night.

47:57.293 --> 47:59.795
Wow. I'm impressed.

47:59.879 --> 48:01.881
You got all that information from the

48:01.965 --> 48:04.216
Channel 71 Police Tracker?

48:04.300 --> 48:06.218
Well, I admit.
I filled in a few blanks myself.

48:06.302 --> 48:09.889
- Huh.
- Okay. Let's go.

48:09.973 --> 48:11.265
Yeah.

48:11.349 --> 48:12.725
So we need to find the Santa Crooks and

48:12.809 --> 48:17.146
that flash drive before
Vance and the cops find you.

48:17.230 --> 48:18.856
Look, I appreciate all
of your help with this,

48:18.940 --> 48:19.899
but you have your own massive duties.

48:19.983 --> 48:21.567
You should get back to them.

48:21.651 --> 48:23.611
No. I'm not going to leave
you until I know for a fact

48:23.695 --> 48:25.988
that you are safe.

48:26.072 --> 48:29.325
Also, um, well,
I can't explain it,

48:29.409 --> 48:30.952
but before I met you,

48:31.036 --> 48:35.414
I was already having a pretty rocky night.

48:35.498 --> 48:40.586
Rebecca MacGregor was not
the first gift I misplaced.

48:40.670 --> 48:44.715
But ever since I started working with you,

48:44.799 --> 48:47.260
I'm in the zone.

48:47.344 --> 48:49.971
I feel more like
Santa than ever.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.766
You sayin'
I'm your secret weapon?

48:53.099 --> 48:56.561
Well, I'm not, not saying that.

48:58.063 --> 48:59.897
Maybe...

48:59.981 --> 49:01.941
this is meant to be.

49:02.025 --> 49:06.321
Maybe I'm supposed to help you.

49:07.697 --> 49:10.491
You have been helping me.
And maybe I can help you, too.

49:14.913 --> 49:18.666
Merry Christmas, theater patron,
but unfortunately, we wrapped.

49:18.750 --> 49:20.793
It's a private party.

49:20.877 --> 49:22.670
I love parties.

49:22.754 --> 49:24.255
I was wondering
if you've seen some people.

49:24.339 --> 49:26.841
A young lady about 5'5" was seen with--

49:26.925 --> 49:28.843
No!

49:28.927 --> 49:32.931
There's no one like that here!

49:33.348 --> 49:36.309
Okay. Well, you won't mind
if I take a look around.

49:39.062 --> 49:42.482
I mind.
We all mind.

49:43.400 --> 49:47.111
- Well, uh, if you should see--
- We won't.

49:47.195 --> 49:50.615
Got it.
Okay.

49:50.699 --> 49:53.368
Bah, humbug!

50:05.839 --> 50:08.674
Well, gotta leave sometime.

50:15.181 --> 50:17.559
He's not budging.

50:18.101 --> 50:19.769
So, what? We're just
supposed to sit here all night?

50:19.853 --> 50:21.354
I mean, that's perfect.

50:21.438 --> 50:22.772
I miss my broadcast.
You don't finish your rounds,

50:22.856 --> 50:25.816
and that's provided we even stay alive.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.026
Merry Christmas to us.

50:27.110 --> 50:28.486
Hey now, don't panic.

50:28.570 --> 50:30.321
We have a saying in the theater,

50:30.405 --> 50:32.907
the show must go on.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.159
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

50:35.243 --> 50:36.869
We have a saying up north.

50:36.953 --> 50:38.329
Sleigh bells and whistles,

50:38.413 --> 50:40.998
candy cane and thistles.

50:41.082 --> 50:43.918
Right?

50:44.627 --> 50:47.546
Lewis, do you have--
do you have any extra wigs?

50:49.716 --> 50:51.676
Oh, honey.

50:53.261 --> 50:55.221
What are you thinking?

50:55.305 --> 50:57.306
Hold on one second.
What was that?

50:57.390 --> 50:59.976
- Sleigh bells and...
- Whistles,

51:00.060 --> 51:02.479
candy cane and thistles.

51:04.314 --> 51:05.648
- What does that mean?
- Really, it's not clear?

51:10.904 --> 51:12.738
Let's go, drama nerds.

51:12.822 --> 51:15.366
They don't call us a traveling
theater troupe for nothing.

51:15.450 --> 51:18.161
Load the van!

51:18.453 --> 51:20.997
Very Merry Christmas to you, my dear.

51:21.081 --> 51:24.167
And to you good, sir.
Ho, ho, ho.

51:24.876 --> 51:27.587
- Quick, quick, quick. Hop in.
- Thank you.

51:53.363 --> 51:55.781
- Oh, thank you.
- Bye, guys.

51:55.865 --> 51:56.824
Thanks.

51:56.908 --> 51:58.410
Thank you.

51:59.119 --> 52:00.244
Hey, we cannot thank you enough.

52:00.328 --> 52:01.996
Thank you.

52:02.080 --> 52:05.207
Oh, please. It's Christmas.
This is the least I can do.

52:05.291 --> 52:07.126
Now you go and show them what you got.

52:07.210 --> 52:08.878
Thank you.

52:11.548 --> 52:14.467
How great were they?

52:14.551 --> 52:17.011
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

52:17.095 --> 52:18.346
Hey!

52:20.890 --> 52:23.018
Wait...

52:37.115 --> 52:39.241
You used to work for Vance
when he was mayor.

52:39.325 --> 52:41.077
Yeah. You have the wrong people.

52:41.161 --> 52:44.205
Look, you know, I just want to
make it easy for you.

52:44.289 --> 52:45.414
Just tell us where the drive is.

52:45.498 --> 52:47.124
We don't have it.

52:47.208 --> 52:49.877
The people that you are looking
for are still out there.

52:49.961 --> 52:51.671
Okay.

52:51.755 --> 52:55.466
You watch them. I'm just going
to go to her house.

52:55.550 --> 52:58.803
And if she stashed it there,
I'll find it.

53:00.638 --> 53:02.556
You're not going to find it!
We don't have it!

53:02.640 --> 53:04.558
I guess we'll see.

53:04.642 --> 53:06.603
I'm watching both of you.

53:09.314 --> 53:10.731
Kidnapping is a felony.

53:10.815 --> 53:12.316
Whatever's on that drive must be crazy.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.568
Yeah, we need to find out what it is.

53:14.652 --> 53:16.654
We? Have you forgot about
sunrise approaching?

53:16.738 --> 53:19.156
I have plenty of time.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.200
They mess with my secret weapon?

53:21.284 --> 53:23.327
They're going down.

53:35.090 --> 53:36.757
Hey, buddy.

53:36.841 --> 53:39.093
Yeah. Good.

53:39.177 --> 53:41.095
<i>Could you not have them
chew right into the phone?</i>

53:41.179 --> 53:42.972
- <i>Stay on task.</i>
- Right.

53:43.056 --> 53:45.391
<i>I don't have to
remind you what will happen</i>

53:45.475 --> 53:47.560
<i>- if this night is not rectified.</i>
- Right.

53:47.644 --> 53:49.520
<i>Go back to her house,</i>

53:49.604 --> 53:51.105
<i>maybe he's returned.</i>

53:51.189 --> 53:54.609
That--that is a great idea, sir.
I mean, a super idea.

53:54.693 --> 53:57.111
Ow-ow!
I just fed you.

53:57.195 --> 53:58.779
<i>Do not make me have to come down there</i>

53:58.863 --> 54:01.907
<i>and take care of this.
I am already in my slippers.</i>

54:01.991 --> 54:04.994
Right. Of course, sir.
I got it.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.458
Let's go.

54:10.542 --> 54:11.959
- You need a hand with that?
- No, I'm good.

54:12.043 --> 54:13.586
What is this?

54:13.670 --> 54:15.630
No, no, no, no, no!

54:15.714 --> 54:17.173
- Hey, hey!
- In you go.

54:17.257 --> 54:18.925
Where you--

54:19.009 --> 54:20.426
No, no, no.

54:24.597 --> 54:26.849
Get in there...

54:40.822 --> 54:42.699
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

54:47.912 --> 54:50.957
Wow. I thought you were good
at tying people up.

54:51.041 --> 54:52.667
It's no use.

54:52.751 --> 54:55.836
And we were so close!
I could just hear everybody now,

54:55.920 --> 54:59.423
the daughter of Sophie Ashburn
chokes again.

54:59.507 --> 55:01.133
Sophie Ashburn?

55:01.217 --> 55:05.763
Wait. <i>The</i> Sophie Ashburn
is your moth-- Wow!

55:05.847 --> 55:08.140
I mean, she is a national treasure. Wow!

55:08.224 --> 55:09.892
Yeah, I know.

55:09.976 --> 55:13.605
Oh. Right.

55:14.439 --> 55:15.940
I mean, I can relate.

55:16.024 --> 55:18.150
Of course you can relate.
Your dad is Santa.

55:18.234 --> 55:19.527
Yeah.

55:19.611 --> 55:21.487
It's not enough to just wear the boots.

55:21.571 --> 55:23.864
You have to own the boots.

55:23.948 --> 55:25.908
And every fear he had about
handing over the reins to me

55:25.992 --> 55:29.161
has come to fruition tonight.

55:29.245 --> 55:34.083
Not only will half the world's
kids not get their gifts,

55:34.167 --> 55:38.630
the Santa title will be stripped
from my family's lineage. Oh...

55:41.800 --> 55:44.218
All on my very first attempt.

55:44.302 --> 55:46.220
Chris, I'm so sorry.

55:46.304 --> 55:48.222
I shouldn't have dragged you
around with me all night

55:48.306 --> 55:53.311
because I thought I needed to
break some big story.

55:54.145 --> 55:55.896
You don't need to break some big story.

55:55.980 --> 55:58.733
You're already a journalist.

55:58.817 --> 56:02.779
You are smart and you are eloquent.

56:04.739 --> 56:07.659
And you're beautiful.

56:09.202 --> 56:11.120
Thank you for saying that.

56:11.204 --> 56:14.916
But I don't feel like those
things. I feel like...

56:15.000 --> 56:18.669
like a scared little kid
in the shadow of my mom.

56:18.753 --> 56:21.297
Scared little kid?
No.

56:21.381 --> 56:25.259
I mean, would a scared little
kid have tried to bring in

56:25.343 --> 56:27.929
a known thief to the police?

56:28.013 --> 56:29.555
Would a scared little kid have stood up to

56:29.639 --> 56:33.935
a highly skilled private security guard?

56:34.019 --> 56:35.603
Would a scared little kid have
the courage to

56:35.687 --> 56:37.605
stand on the stage in front of
a roomful of people

56:37.689 --> 56:39.774
and deliver a perfect monologue?

56:39.858 --> 56:45.404
You, Avery Quinn,
are not a scared little kid.

56:45.488 --> 56:47.323
Thank you.

56:48.908 --> 56:51.661
We may not be our parents,

56:51.745 --> 56:55.414
but we can be great in our own way.

57:15.435 --> 57:18.980
Okay.
Open, sesame!

57:22.734 --> 57:25.362
That's not very polite!

57:29.074 --> 57:30.157
We got him!

57:30.241 --> 57:31.492
I can feel the calluses on your hands!

57:31.576 --> 57:32.994
We caught the Santa Crook!

57:33.078 --> 57:36.331
Easy!
Suit's a rental, pal!

57:38.416 --> 57:41.002
All right!

57:45.632 --> 57:48.467
Well...no, no, no, no.
Nope.

57:48.551 --> 57:50.678
Uh, what is this?

57:50.762 --> 57:52.638
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No!

57:52.722 --> 57:56.058
What's going on?
Who are--

57:56.142 --> 57:57.352
Put me through.

57:58.770 --> 58:00.187
Don't move.

58:00.271 --> 58:01.355
I don't know what they're into,
I'm not--

58:01.439 --> 58:03.232
- Quiet!
- Okay!

58:03.316 --> 58:05.026
Honey, shh.

58:05.110 --> 58:08.154
What about you? Where'd you get
your suit from, huh?

58:08.238 --> 58:10.281
My mom made it.

58:10.615 --> 58:12.199
Where'd you get yours?

58:20.500 --> 58:22.377
Okay, drive, where are you?

58:30.760 --> 58:32.303
Come on!

58:33.596 --> 58:35.181
Ugh!

58:42.063 --> 58:46.192
Yeah, boss?

58:47.527 --> 58:48.903
Yeah, yeah.

58:48.987 --> 58:51.697
Yeah, they're definitely
searching for that drive.

58:51.781 --> 58:55.743
I get why the mistaken identity.
Those two look exactly like us.

58:55.827 --> 58:57.287
Sure, when they're facing that direction.

58:58.747 --> 59:01.416
Oh, yes. Help me.

59:03.543 --> 59:04.586
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:05.337 --> 59:08.589
So...

59:08.673 --> 59:10.549
Why'd they drag you two in here?

59:10.633 --> 59:13.219
I don't know. You know...

59:13.303 --> 59:15.888
They mentioned something about a drive?

59:15.972 --> 59:17.723
What about you?

59:17.807 --> 59:21.644
We could think of a reason or two.

59:21.728 --> 59:25.940
Hey, are you the
Fake Santa Crook?

59:26.024 --> 59:28.526
I'm a big fan of vigilante justice.

59:28.610 --> 59:32.697
And he has been all over the news.

59:32.781 --> 59:35.783
They talk about him
an awful lot, don't they?

59:35.867 --> 59:37.159
- It is you. Wow.
- Yeah.

59:37.243 --> 59:40.037
And just him, like I'm barely here, huh?

59:40.121 --> 59:42.123
- Here we go.
- Oh please.

59:42.207 --> 59:43.958
It's all good to talk except for
when the talk's about me?

59:44.042 --> 59:45.543
- It begins.
- Come on.

59:45.627 --> 59:47.253
It's about us.

59:47.337 --> 59:50.047
No, it's never about us,
it's always about you.

59:50.131 --> 59:52.258
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

59:52.342 --> 59:55.428
And if we were the Santa Crooks--plural--

59:55.512 --> 59:57.346
what's it to you? Huh?

59:57.430 --> 59:59.640
Nothing. We're just,
you know, curious people.

59:59.724 --> 01:00:00.808
Yep.

01:00:00.892 --> 01:00:03.853
Wait a second.

01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:06.397
- What's changed?
- Something's changed.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:07.690
The weather.

01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:09.692
Yeah, weather is changing constantly.

01:00:09.776 --> 01:00:11.652
Snow, sleet...

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:13.070
- Hail.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:14.655
Subtle, but different.

01:00:14.739 --> 01:00:16.073
Do you have a favorite snow form?

01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:18.576
You ask a lot of questions.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.953
- Curious people.
- Curiosity. Yeah.

01:00:21.037 --> 01:00:24.540
Like, what do you think is on that drive?

01:00:24.624 --> 01:00:26.918
We don't know what's on it.
And we don't really care.

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:29.962
We weren't supposed to look.

01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:32.590
Did you know that there would be a drive?

01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:34.008
Did somebody put you up to this?

01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.260
We're not saying anything
without a lawyer.

01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:38.012
We gotta figure a way out of here.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:40.514
They're still expecting us
at the drop at 3AM!

01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:42.516
I don't even know the address.
I wrote it on a Post-it,

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.019
stuck it on the flash drive,
and it's in the bag.

01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:46.896
What do you want me to do?
Walk right in there and grab it?

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.147
And this is why--

01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:49.523
- That's what we have to do.
- Yeah.

01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:51.192
I'm a little tied up at the moment, honey.

01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:52.610
He's got it.

01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:54.862
- Yeah, he has it.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:54.946 --> 01:00:56.697
We should take a run for it.

01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:58.616
Max! I found the flash drive!

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.660
I gotta call the boss.

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:02.244
Let's go! Let's just go!
Let's just go!

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.083
Okay, go!
Go, go, go!

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:09.293
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare! Get back here!

01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:11.338
- Could you help us out--
- You get back here!

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:13.714
- Hey!
- Come on!

01:01:13.798 --> 01:01:15.342
You're the worst
Santa ever!

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.263
- You get it?
- Yes!

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:21.806
We have to go see
who's waiting for the drop.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.140
You are a gutsy lady,
Avery Quinn.

01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:24.267
Maybe I can break this, clear my name

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:25.434
and then we can save Christmas!

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.144
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:27.228 --> 01:01:28.396
Wait. Where are you going?

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.689
Okay, that way, that way, that way.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:30.856
I don't know where we are, at all.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.108
I don't know either.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:39.699
Yeah?

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:42.910
You got it.
Oh, nice work.

01:01:42.994 --> 01:01:45.204
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:01:45.288 --> 01:01:48.583
I'll let the big guy know
that it's been recovered.

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:54.547
<i>Merry Christmas to me.</i>

01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:10.814
Go, go, go!

01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:12.773
Go, go!

01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:46.557
Seriously? Seriously?

01:02:46.641 --> 01:02:49.769
I leave for five minutes
and the drive's gone.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.479
What happened?

01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:53.856
I-I-I don't know, we just turned
our back for a second.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.192
They were gone. I don't know.

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:58.527
I checked out back.
They're not there. I don't know.

01:02:58.611 --> 01:02:59.779
They're gone.

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.906
- Who are these two?
- Chris! Chris!

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:06.535
You know what? Never mind.
Spread out. Get me that drive.

01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:09.205
Now! Now!

01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:16.837
Look, boss, I don't know what
you want me to say. I'm sorry.

01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:18.840
Look, we'll find them.
We'll find them.

01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:26.514
Come on!

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:28.724
They're so bad at tying people.

01:03:28.808 --> 01:03:30.643
Ow, jeez!

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:41.404
Oh, there's no taxis. It's
Christmas Eve, it makes sense.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:43.572
Neither of us have phones.
Sorry about that, by the way.

01:03:43.656 --> 01:03:46.200
Ah, that's okay. But I do need
to get in touch with my people.

01:03:46.284 --> 01:03:48.536
Let them know that I haven't
abandoned my duties.

01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:50.329
Hey. Hey, Chris.

01:03:50.413 --> 01:03:51.831
The lights are on.
They'll have a phone.

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.416
We can call two taxis,

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.585
one to get me to the corner
of 14 and Chestnut by 3AM

01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:57.086
to see who's waiting for the drive

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:58.671
and then one to take you
to go meet your team.

01:03:58.755 --> 01:04:00.047
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:01.549
No, no. I'm not going to let you
just wait on

01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:05.261
some random street corner at 3AM.

01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:07.180
Uh, well, how much time do we have?

01:04:07.555 --> 01:04:09.348
It's 2:43.

01:04:09.432 --> 01:04:11.976
Okay, We can totally make this.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.936
You can finish your--
your rounds.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.314
And I can break whatever this is wide open

01:04:16.398 --> 01:04:17.898
on local television.

01:04:17.982 --> 01:04:20.693
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:23.362
Oh! Come here, come on.

01:04:31.496 --> 01:04:33.372
Okay, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.675
Right.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.931
A taxi!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:52.475
- Hey. Hey, hey!
- Hey! No!

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:03.152
- Oh, oh. Go, go, go.
- Seriously?

01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:05.446
Really don't wanna give up,
do they. Is it open?

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:06.906
No.

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.408
Come on, one of these has to be open.

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:15.373
Oh, hey. This one's open.
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:18.668
- Take your coat down.
- What?

01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:20.044
It's too obvious.

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:22.255
Okay.

01:05:23.923 --> 01:05:25.549
- Trust me.
- What?

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:40.607
Oh! Merry Christmas!

01:05:47.947 --> 01:05:50.700
Hey, come on!
Let's go.

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:03.004
Wow, I uh...

01:06:03.088 --> 01:06:07.258
Uh yeah. You know, they were
looking for us. Not a couple.

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.093
Yeah, decoy.

01:06:09.177 --> 01:06:11.346
But it was...

01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:14.516
It was...s-smart.

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:19.688
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:06:23.024 --> 01:06:26.361
- Oh...
- Oh, he has a phone...

01:06:37.956 --> 01:06:40.958
Come on, big money
face recognition, let's go.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:42.335
Yes!

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:46.172
We are cooking with gas, he's got the app.

01:06:46.256 --> 01:06:47.841
Sign in...

01:06:49.342 --> 01:06:51.010
Four minutes.

01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:55.765
Wow. You are very resourceful.

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:57.517
Thanks.

01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:02.022
- Hey, Avery, your hat.
- What?

01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:06.526
Tony's Pizza!

01:07:07.986 --> 01:07:09.821
Thanks, buddy.

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:12.741
We were never here.

01:07:13.366 --> 01:07:15.368
Who is that?

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:25.712
Hey, fellow Santa Crook.
You wanna thieve us a way home?

01:07:28.548 --> 01:07:31.134
Hey! This one's open.

01:07:33.303 --> 01:07:35.221
Can hotwire it.

01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:37.682
All right. Okay, here we go.

01:07:39.893 --> 01:07:42.520
Um, can you circle the block and
meet us at the top?

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:44.063
- No problem.
- Thank you.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:46.857
Right on time.
2:59.

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.658
Oh, this feels like we're on a stakeout.

01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:58.369
We're on a Christmas stakeout.

01:07:58.453 --> 01:07:59.578
I mean, I've never really been on one,

01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:01.748
but I imagine it would feel like this.

01:08:02.999 --> 01:08:05.751
So now what?

01:08:05.835 --> 01:08:07.087
I need to get a closer look, come here.

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:09.714
Frank, we need to get home.

01:08:09.798 --> 01:08:11.340
The kids are going to be up
in a few hours,

01:08:11.424 --> 01:08:13.009
and I'd like to get some sleep.

01:08:13.093 --> 01:08:15.970
Me? You are always
the last to leave a party.

01:08:16.054 --> 01:08:18.223
- Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk...
- Merry Christmas...

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:23.185
It's all starting to make sense.

01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:24.937
First, Vance's guys are after us.

01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:26.939
And the person waiting for that
that drive is Elizabeth Mayhew,

01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:28.357
Peter Mayhew's wife.

01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:29.942
Wait, I don't know who that is.

01:08:30.026 --> 01:08:31.444
Right? Of course not.

01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:32.987
You North Polers
wouldn't follow Dayton politics.

01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:35.823
So Peter Mayhew used to
work for the former mayor,

01:08:35.907 --> 01:08:37.700
but he accused him of stealing funds

01:08:37.784 --> 01:08:39.285
from this foundation he started

01:08:39.369 --> 01:08:41.203
that provides Christmas for
people who can't afford it.

01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:43.956
Peter got fired, tried to sue
for wrongful termination,

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.792
but lost. Nobody believes him
because Vance was the mayor.

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.003
And now he's such an upstanding citizen.

01:08:49.087 --> 01:08:51.172
So whatever's on this drive
has something to do with

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:52.924
the conflict btween those two.

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:55.301
Peter insists he's seen
two sets of accounting records

01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:56.761
- for the charity.
- Okay.

01:08:56.845 --> 01:09:01.098
And if they're on there,
this Peter guy ivindicated.

01:09:01.182 --> 01:09:03.643
I mean, it kind of feels like
Peter has set up a string of

01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:06.729
robberies to make it look like
some serial theft ring,

01:09:06.813 --> 01:09:08.481
when, in fact,
he's only targeting one safe,

01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:11.901
Vance's, to get that drive.

01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:15.196
I break this, and they're both going down.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.948
Wow.

01:09:17.032 --> 01:09:19.283
Wow, Avery, that's, that's really smart.

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:21.661
- That's very impressive.
- If I'm right.

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:24.121
Well, I'm definitely rooting for you.

01:09:24.205 --> 01:09:27.333
So at least one of us
will have a successful evening.

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:28.834
Hey, there's still time.

01:09:28.918 --> 01:09:30.336
Yeah.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.921
- Okay, go. Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:33.089
Here.

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:35.091
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.850
Aw, come on, man. Not now.

01:09:44.934 --> 01:09:47.353
- Not now.
- No, we got this. It's fine.

01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:48.354
It's fine, we can--

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.359
You're sweating right now,
profusely. Wipe or something.

01:09:53.443 --> 01:09:54.777
We'll just be cool.

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.863
We'll be cool, take a big breath.

01:09:57.947 --> 01:10:00.616
- Step out of the car, please.
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.952
Stay cool, stay cool.

01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:06.122
There a problem, Sarge--uh,
Officer?

01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:07.540
There a problem?

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:09.166
This car was reported stolen this evening.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.754
Hands up, both of you.

01:10:13.546 --> 01:10:15.089
This is Billings,

01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:18.676
I need backup at the corner of
Alvarado and Fourth.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.386
I think I got the Santa Crook, over.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:25.016
Santa Crooks, plural.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.059
Both of us.

01:10:39.364 --> 01:10:41.157
Thanks, Carl. Five stars.

01:10:42.534 --> 01:10:44.035
Okay.

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:45.786
I need to get my computer.
I need to write it up.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.371
I need to send it to Nancy.

01:10:47.455 --> 01:10:49.415
We have plenty of time.
We can still get back on track.

01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:52.043
You can still have all your
deliveries done, it will be no--

01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:56.088
Oh! That's what happened to my phone.

01:10:56.172 --> 01:10:57.590
It still works.

01:10:57.674 --> 01:10:59.508
- I can call Dillon--
- Have him meet you here.

01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:01.177
- Great.
- Yes!

01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:04.055
Chris.

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:07.516
Okay, all right.
Wait back here.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.357
All right, I understand.
Thanks, Dillon.

01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:24.284
Oh wow. Look at this place.
Avery, I am so sorry.

01:11:26.953 --> 01:11:28.537
I'll cry about it tomorrow.

01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:31.332
Right now, I just need to see
if this works.

01:11:34.878 --> 01:11:37.129
So Dillon and my dad are coming.

01:11:37.213 --> 01:11:38.464
Santa's coming?

01:11:38.548 --> 01:11:39.799
That is not good news.

01:11:39.883 --> 01:11:43.636
Right. Sorry.
Just tell him it's all my fault.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.137
That's not a lie.

01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.265
I tied you up. I'm the one
that ruined Christmas.

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:50.852
There are rules to my job,
and I have broken most of them.

01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:55.982
But none of the ones that really count.

01:11:56.066 --> 01:12:00.987
I mean, you have been nothing
but kind and, and generous

01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:04.615
and caring. I mean, the way
you've helped me

01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:07.827
and how you inspired
that entire acting troupe,

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:11.539
it all came so naturally.
You are

01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.666
amazing.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.544
So if you need me to tell
your dad that you are 100%

01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:19.964
owning those boots,
I will.

01:12:20.048 --> 01:12:22.258
Thank you.

01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.347
Tell me what now?

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.016
Oh, hello, Avery.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:30.933
Hi.

01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:33.436
Please, elucidate me.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.439
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This job is your destiny.

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:38.775
He cannot take that away from you.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.618
Dad, you didn't need to come here tonight.

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:51.329
Evidently, I did.

01:12:51.413 --> 01:12:55.207
Look, I know I messed up, and
I know that you keep telling me

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:59.170
that I have to make it my own
and that I'm not fully in it.

01:12:59.254 --> 01:13:01.881
But tonight...

01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:07.386
Tonight you should have seen me.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:10.056
Oh, when you went AWOL?

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.225
Apparently you were fraternizing
with thespians.

01:13:13.309 --> 01:13:15.561
Okay. I wasn't perfect at every moment,

01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:17.897
but I was exactly where
I needed to be.

01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:21.150
And I will get the job done
before sunrise. I promise.

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:26.238
Dad, all night
I was struggling to

01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:27.698
connect,

01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:29.033
to find my skills,

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:31.035
to remember people's pivotal gifts.

01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:36.207
But then I remembered something.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:40.711
I remember the gift that you
gave me all those years ago.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:44.840
I was four years old and it was just...

01:13:44.924 --> 01:13:48.094
It was just a small bear.

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:52.139
But when I held that bear,
I felt loved.

01:13:52.223 --> 01:13:55.434
I felt seen.
That gift, that gift--

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:58.354
Your pivotal gift.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:03.776
That gift made me realize that
this is who I am supposed to be.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.321
That want to give people that
exact same feeling.

01:14:07.405 --> 01:14:09.865
That's what I call

01:14:09.949 --> 01:14:13.286
owning your boots.

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:15.288
You're not mad?

01:14:15.372 --> 01:14:18.124
Oh, I'm furious.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:21.294
With myself.

01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:23.170
I was too hard on you.

01:14:23.254 --> 01:14:26.674
I should have known that
you had it in you all along.

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:30.595
Now, go on.
You have a job to do.

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:38.269
Proud of you, Son.

01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:40.146
Thanks, Dad.

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:46.986
Yeah?

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:48.696
<i>Well?</i>

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.407
We haven't been able to find her yet.

01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:53.743
<i>Clearly I can't trust
you to handle things.</i>

01:14:53.827 --> 01:14:55.995
I'm sorry, sir.
She got away.

01:14:56.079 --> 01:14:58.623
<i>She has to go home some time.</i>

01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:02.835
<i>I'm heading to her place now.
She'll give me that drive.</i>

01:15:02.919 --> 01:15:04.170
You got it.

01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:09.592
I was right, there are
two sets of accounting records

01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.260
for the charity.

01:15:11.344 --> 01:15:14.221
Former mayor has been a very
naughty boy this year.

01:15:14.305 --> 01:15:15.973
I wouldn't say
I've been naughty.

01:15:16.057 --> 01:15:17.850
But my boys tell me you have.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.489
I've done a lot of good, actually.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:35.201
I bring Christmas joy

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:39.038
to people who otherwise wouldn't
get the chance to celebrate.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:41.248
Well, that's a bunch of malarkey.

01:15:41.332 --> 01:15:45.294
Yeah. I don't really understand
how a $45,000 office renovation

01:15:45.378 --> 01:15:49.173
or trips on private jets or a Ferrari

01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:52.718
bring much joy to those less fortunate.

01:15:52.802 --> 01:15:54.971
Peter Mayhew was right about you.

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:56.597
You don't have the whole story.

01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:59.433
Oh, but I do, Hewie Vance.

01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:02.937
You're the same Hewie Vance who
grew up in government housing,

01:16:03.021 --> 01:16:04.772
You struggled to overcome
parents weren't quite fit

01:16:04.856 --> 01:16:08.025
for the role and built a life yourself,

01:16:08.109 --> 01:16:11.612
using your sheer will
and the gift of your intellect.

01:16:11.696 --> 01:16:16.534
But you, Hewie, you let the
troubles of your past

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:19.245
infect your soul with greed.

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:23.833
So, yes, we do have the whole story.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:26.627
Including the ending right here.

01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:30.464
Listen, I don't know what
you got going on here,

01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:32.258
but I'm a reasonable man.

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:35.803
I'm also a very powerful one.

01:16:35.887 --> 01:16:38.848
Give me the thumb drive and the laptop

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:42.768
and we can all just carry on.

01:16:42.852 --> 01:16:45.521
I'm not messing around.

01:16:45.605 --> 01:16:47.440
Easy.

01:16:47.524 --> 01:16:49.817
Fine. Take it.

01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:52.820
See, you're a smart one.

01:16:52.904 --> 01:16:54.488
I already sent the files to the station,

01:16:54.572 --> 01:16:56.365
so if anything happens to me
or anyone else here,

01:16:56.449 --> 01:16:58.200
they'll know who to look for.

01:16:58.284 --> 01:17:01.329
- Well done, young lady.
- Thanks, Santa.

01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:03.998
Oh, and Hewie?
I think that we should mention

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:06.167
that you entering here unannounced

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:09.086
you've officially trespassed
private property.

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:17.678
Freeze Hewie!

01:17:17.762 --> 01:17:21.015
All right, boys.
Book 'em!

01:17:21.099 --> 01:17:23.727
I never voted for you anyways.

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:25.519
Wait! What time is it?

01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:28.439
Uh, 4:46.

01:17:28.523 --> 01:17:29.982
Okay, that's just over
an hour till sunrise

01:17:30.066 --> 01:17:32.068
and I'm supposed to be
on the air in 14 minutes!

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:34.195
It's okay.

01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:35.988
We'll head out the back door.

01:17:36.072 --> 01:17:37.657
Dad, Dillon, we're giving Avery a ride.

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:40.118
What?

01:17:42.203 --> 01:17:44.497
There's no way she would miss
this. Something is wrong!

01:17:44.914 --> 01:17:47.375
Coffee's up!

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.044
- Talia.
- Yeah?

01:17:50.128 --> 01:17:52.338
- Can you read?
- Of course.

01:17:52.422 --> 01:17:54.382
If Avery doesn't make it in,
you're going on.

01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:56.592
No, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

01:17:56.676 --> 01:18:00.137
Wardrobe! Anybody.
I need a blazer for Talia, now!

01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:02.890
No blazer!
No, no, no.

01:18:02.974 --> 01:18:04.892
Blazer! Blazer!

01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:06.269
Get my email in front of Nancy

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:09.147
and have the graphics team
start working on it.

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:10.898
This is real.

01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:12.275
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.153
Your chariot awaits.

01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:21.409
Oh, six minutes!
We're never going to make it.

01:18:21.493 --> 01:18:22.868
Not to worry.

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:27.665
This vehicle functions outside
of linear time and space.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:29.542
We'll get you there on time.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.253
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:18:36.174 --> 01:18:38.342
You're gonna be fine.

01:18:38.426 --> 01:18:40.761
Pretend they're all in their underwear.

01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:42.346
All three million of them?

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.724
I have faith in you, Talia.

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:46.518
Okay.

01:18:49.312 --> 01:18:50.771
It's from Avery.

01:18:50.855 --> 01:18:53.483
Wait, is this real?

01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:55.985
It's three minutes to air,
Avery, where are you?

01:18:56.069 --> 01:18:58.070
Here, read that.
This story's gonna be huge.

01:18:58.154 --> 01:19:00.699
Nancy...
No, Nancy.

01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:05.578
Whoa! Look at me. I'm a mess.

01:19:05.662 --> 01:19:07.455
I can't-- I can't do this
at the best of times.

01:19:07.539 --> 01:19:09.123
There's no way
I'm gonna be a--thank you--

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.333
able to do this rushed.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:13.252
You can do this.
I believe in you.

01:19:13.336 --> 01:19:16.047
Avery, you got this.

01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.591
So do you. You have an hour.
Go, go, go.

01:19:18.675 --> 01:19:21.720
The children of the Western
Hemisphere are waiting.

01:19:22.554 --> 01:19:23.638
Yeah.

01:19:23.722 --> 01:19:25.557
Okay, let's go.

01:19:28.935 --> 01:19:30.519
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

01:19:30.603 --> 01:19:32.563
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm here. I'm here.

01:19:32.647 --> 01:19:35.233
Whoop, sorry!
I'll get that later.

01:19:36.901 --> 01:19:38.570
I'm here.
Oh, yes!

01:19:44.701 --> 01:19:46.953
Is everybody using everything today?

01:19:48.455 --> 01:19:49.830
<i>And we're on in five, four...</i>

01:19:49.914 --> 01:19:50.998
Sorry.

01:19:51.082 --> 01:19:54.335
<i>...three, two...</i>

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.629
Good morning, Dayton, and Merry Christmas.

01:19:56.713 --> 01:19:58.673
I'm Avery Quinn, in for Misty McAllen.

01:19:58.757 --> 01:20:01.092
In breaking news,
former mayor Hewitt Vance

01:20:01.176 --> 01:20:03.928
has been a very naughty boy
this Christmas.

01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:05.638
Channel 71 has learned exclusively

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.890
that previous allegations
made by Peter Mayhew

01:20:07.974 --> 01:20:09.767
<i>are, in fact, true.</i>

01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:11.852
<i>Channel 71 learned that the
string of robberies</i>

01:20:11.936 --> 01:20:14.855
<i>was actually an elaborate plan
concocted by Peter Mayhew</i>

01:20:14.939 --> 01:20:15.982
<i>to recover the evidence.</i>

01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:17.650
That's my girl.

01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:20.779
I could have done this.

01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:25.116
<i>It seems both men
are in for an unwelcome gift</i>

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.659
<i>this Christmas.</i>

01:20:26.743 --> 01:20:29.245
I'd say trespassing is
the least of your worries.

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:31.747
And that concludes
the story of the Santa Crooks,

01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:33.124
the philanthropist

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.042
and a wild ride of mistaken identity

01:20:35.126 --> 01:20:37.336
which included yours truly.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.796
And coming up after the break,

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.382
Beyoncé sings for the troops
this holiday season.

01:20:41.466 --> 01:20:43.551
Channel 71 has the story.

01:20:43.635 --> 01:20:44.678
Stay tuned.

01:20:53.019 --> 01:20:55.980
Oh! So proud of you.
You did it!

01:20:57.607 --> 01:20:59.191
Yes!

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:04.196
Wow. Look at you,

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.239
What are you doing here?

01:21:05.323 --> 01:21:07.575
You're a mess.

01:21:07.659 --> 01:21:10.286
A beautiful, wonderful mess.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.663
Yes, I am a mess.

01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:14.373
But I'm a mess with a weekend anchor job,

01:21:14.457 --> 01:21:16.250
so I don't really care.

01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:17.835
- You got the gig?
- I got the gig.

01:21:17.919 --> 01:21:20.504
Oh, Avery. Congratulations!

01:21:20.588 --> 01:21:22.381
Thank you. I couldn't have done
it without you.

01:21:22.465 --> 01:21:23.966
Yes, you could have.

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:25.885
No, I mean, I literally would
not have made it here

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:28.596
without you. I don't even
know where my car is.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.973
- Wait, hold on. What about you?
- Did you finish your rounds?

01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:36.646
Mm-hmm. All except one gift.

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:38.690
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:41.192 --> 01:21:42.610
Boots.

01:21:42.694 --> 01:21:45.696
Yeah, all this talk of owning our boots.

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.864
I thought this would be a reminder

01:21:46.948 --> 01:21:49.784
about how you really did.

01:21:49.868 --> 01:21:53.621
Also, it might come in handy
if you ever decide to visit me

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:55.999
up north.

01:21:56.374 --> 01:21:58.001
I'd like that.

01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:01.462
So are you Chris Kringle?

01:22:01.546 --> 01:22:04.090
Oh no, no. Vanderschmidt.

01:22:04.174 --> 01:22:06.842
The Kringles were a lot of Santas ago.

01:22:06.926 --> 01:22:08.511
- Right.
- Yes.

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:13.557
Well, Chris Vanderschmidt,
that was a heck of a night.

01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:18.104
Sure was. Crazy, unexpected.

01:22:18.188 --> 01:22:19.939
A little dangerous.

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:21.565
Definitely one for the books.

01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:23.192
I can't believe you pulled it off.

01:22:23.276 --> 01:22:25.945
Um...did you just do that?

01:22:45.548 --> 01:22:49.510
So I know we had a pretty late night, but

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:52.888
how do you feel about
having breakfast someplace warm?

01:22:52.972 --> 01:22:54.640
What are you thinking?

01:22:54.724 --> 01:22:56.434
Well,

01:22:56.518 --> 01:22:59.604
have you ever been to Bali?

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:02.189
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:02.273 --> 01:23:04.025
Oh, hey guys.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.359
After you.

01:23:05.443 --> 01:23:07.695
This is crazy.

01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:09.030
Wait, what are we supposed to tell people

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:12.366
if they ask how we met?

01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:14.910
Well, I guess we can just tell
them that it was

01:23:14.994 --> 01:23:16.829
a Christmas miracle.

01:23:16.913 --> 01:23:19.541
Sure. Yeah.
They'll totally buy that.

01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:22.376
Merry Christmas, Avery.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.086
Merry Christmas, Santa.
