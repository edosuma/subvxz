WEBVTT

00:31.740 --> 00:34.492
Hey. Good morning.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.370
-Good morning.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.080
Bill Withers, huh?

00:39.664 --> 00:41.124
-Strong choice.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.793
-Yeah, I love the Withers. Rest in peace.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.378
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.049
-Last night was an incredibly fun evening.
-Agreed.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.719
Almost made me forget there was
a demonic entity that wanted to kill us.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.180
Oh. Yeah, well,
I think I can probably take her.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.601
Wow, you're making a real feast.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.186
Yeah. Trying to.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.480
"Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey!"

01:04.564 --> 01:06.357
What is-- What is that that's happening?

01:06.441 --> 01:10.028
It's just an accent
I've been workin' on for a while.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.239
Oh, is that-- What, is it Dutch or…

01:13.323 --> 01:14.783
-Australian!
-Australian.

01:14.866 --> 01:15.825
Similar, I think.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.453
I thought it was, like,
a high-pitched troll.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.499
You know, normally I make
just a really weird smoothie for brekkie.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.834
But today I wanted
to try something a little nicer.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.545
Kind of a feast, you know,
as a display of love.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.216
Oops.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.260
Hey, sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Uh…

01:34.344 --> 01:35.720
Not that, like, love is a bad word

01:35.804 --> 01:38.515
or that feeling love for someone
is a bad thing, at all.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.016
I just didn't mean to blurt it out.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.976
Clark, you can say whatever you want.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.312
Oh, cool.

01:44.896 --> 01:48.733
Um… You know, because… I do love you.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.485
And I have for a long time.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.112
So…

01:53.613 --> 01:56.825
-Oh, my eggs must be done.
-No, it's my phone. I think.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.750
Uh!

02:06.292 --> 02:09.087
It's a… I matched up
with somebody on Tinder.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.508
It dings you when you get a match.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.260
-Oh, Tinder.

02:15.927 --> 02:19.264
Oh, my God.
This guy says that he drives a 19-wheeler.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.560
-Wow, he's got a whole extra wheel, huh?
-I guess! I guess I'll find out.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.562
Or…

02:26.521 --> 02:27.438
Or maybe I won't?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.441
That-- Which would be cool.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.485
But either way.
Like, whatever you wanna do.

02:32.569 --> 02:36.614
It's obviously a free, um… free country.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.866
You do what you like.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.578
Thank you. It looks beautiful.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.038
Oh, I'm glad… glad you like it.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.916
I just want to say, for the record, um…

02:47.417 --> 02:51.921
that me saying "love," I'm not
expecting you to say anything back.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.967
Clark.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.184
Well, I guess I'd really love
to be able to throw lightning bolts,

03:04.267 --> 03:05.685
but this is pretty cool too.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.439
Yeah, flower guy.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.733
-Hey, pals!

03:13.526 --> 03:15.403
Oh, shit.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.573
Oh!

03:19.449 --> 03:20.617
Hey, guys!

03:20.700 --> 03:23.369
-No! Not over the threshold.
-Thank you.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.414
Well, if you don't
walk over that threshold,

03:26.497 --> 03:30.501
you won't get any of my famous
mortadella hospitality platter.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.045
Mm!

03:32.128 --> 03:33.630
Smells so good.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.964
Oh, I love mortadella.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.091
Come on, you guys. Let's hang out.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.761
I mean, it's not like
I'm a murderer or something.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.096
You literally
just tried to murder us last night.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.182
You guys just don't get my humor.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.017
Yet!

03:46.893 --> 03:49.395
But look. It's been a long couple of days.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.525
Did you know that
your friend Chamuel tried to kill me?

03:54.609 --> 03:57.195
Before I grabbed him
and put him in a secure location,

03:57.278 --> 03:59.364
where I'll be sure to keep torturing him,

03:59.447 --> 04:01.950
unless you stop with the bullshit, Clarky.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.910
I don't think you're telling the truth.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.245
-No.
-You've been known to lie.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.913
-And--
-She's the lord of lies.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.248
-Yes.
-It's your title.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.583
And what do you mean,
I have to stop with the bull,

04:10.667 --> 04:11.876
-um…
-Shit.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.670
-Thank you.
-Listen, God's old.

04:13.753 --> 04:17.131
And Lucifer
is stone cold whoopin' that ass.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.885
Besides, I'm also in really big trouble
for failing to bring you in already.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.888
Well, why would we give two shits
if you're in trouble?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.265
Because…

04:26.641 --> 04:31.271
my boss isn't as nice as I am.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.274
A little glazed pimento loaf?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.025
-Amily, no!
-I can smell it.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.987
-It's glazed with tequila.
-That's what I thought. Oh God.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.571
-That's gorgeous.
<i>-Añejo.</i>

04:40.655 --> 04:42.198
It's<i> añejo.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:43.366
-No.
-That's not… You're not…

04:43.449 --> 04:44.784
I know what you're doing.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.370
-You're not fighting fair.
-No. And what do you mean, your boss?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.622
-Uh… Wha… Who's your boss?
-Oh!

04:49.706 --> 04:52.041
That's a really good question. I have two.

04:52.667 --> 04:57.672
Beelzebub. He's, like…
He's my immediate superior.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.091
I'm closin' in.

05:00.174 --> 05:03.052
-And then Lucifer is the super boss.
-Oh.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.345
-Yeah.
-Three names.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.640
I thought it was one. Just different
names. Like Sue, Susan, Susie.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.101
-That's not exactly how I thought of it.
-Oh.

05:10.184 --> 05:14.022
But I thought it was three different…
Isn't it… Aren't you the same demon?

05:14.105 --> 05:18.026
That is racist, Clark.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.236
We are three different demons.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.323
Have you read
John Wycliffe's classification of demons?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.991
Is there an audiobook?

05:25.074 --> 05:27.076
Oh, God. Of course you haven't.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.037
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.122
I'm not gonna hold that against you.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.709
All I'm saying is that
if my boss has to come into the picture,

05:35.668 --> 05:37.086
it's gonna get ugly.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.173
He's not gonna bring you
an ambrosia salad, now is he?

05:40.256 --> 05:41.632
Oh, it's mini marshmallows.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.718
-Just follow the salad.
-No.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.429
And let me wipe your mind clean for you.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.847
-Fightin' dirty.
-Guys.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.059
-Um… we'll politely decline your offer.
-Yeah.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.353
-And wish you the best day.
-Really?

05:53.436 --> 05:56.481
I mean, why? Do you know
how much work this took to do this?

05:56.564 --> 06:00.193
I don't understand. What's wrong
with my offer? What has God done for you?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.445
She doesn't put out a spread like this!

06:02.528 --> 06:03.946
-Tell me!
-It's a good spread.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.032
I'll give you that. It's a great spread.

06:06.115 --> 06:11.371
Let me guess.
God told you to get the message out,

06:11.454 --> 06:13.247
and then didn't tell you how to do it.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.875
It's not, you know… Actually, that is not…

06:15.958 --> 06:19.337
"Hey, guys, I need you
to do this really hard thing for me."

06:19.420 --> 06:21.839
"But I'm not gonna tell you
exactly how to do it."

06:21.923 --> 06:24.425
"And I'm not gonna give you any fun food."

06:24.509 --> 06:25.385
Am I close?

06:27.011 --> 06:31.140
You know, what's really frustrating is
I know I'm right and you know I'm right.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.892
But yet, you still won't play ball.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.269
But it's fine,
because do you know what I find?

06:35.353 --> 06:38.731
-I just think that dummies like you guys…
-This is gonna be hot.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.569
See these dogs?
You were gonna get all of these.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.405
But now you get nothing!

06:46.280 --> 06:48.783
Because dummies don't get…

06:50.451 --> 06:51.369
dogs!

06:51.953 --> 06:54.038
-It's wasteful.
-Do you know what I'm gonna do?

06:54.747 --> 06:58.209
I'm gonna go back
to the war up there in Heaven.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.129
-And I'm gonna stab an angel.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.547
But not just any angel.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.759
The biggest, juiciest angel I can find.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.430
And I hope you feel it, Clark.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.100
-Right in your nutsack.
-Oh, let's not get that involved.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.685
Bye, best friends.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.775
Oh!

07:26.988 --> 07:30.074
See? All you have to
do is press refresh. Poof!

07:30.158 --> 07:33.369
It's like magic. All right.
Thank you for calling Arresta. Bye-bye.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.249
-So, what do you think?
-Oh, whoa!

07:38.332 --> 07:40.626
-Whoa?
-Uh-- Uh, did I just say whoa?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.170
-Yeah.
-Uh, of course I did.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.296
Because, uh…

07:44.255 --> 07:47.800
That is a word I say
when I am, uh, loving something so much.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.219
Because I love horses.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.473
And, uh you know, when you say "whoa,"

07:53.556 --> 07:56.893
it's because you've been enjoying a…
a horse ride so much,

07:56.976 --> 07:59.312
and everything is just wonderful.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.688
Meaning that your hair

08:01.522 --> 08:03.149
looks just perfect.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.734
Whoa.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.152
It's not too much, right?

08:06.235 --> 08:09.822
Oh, no, no, of course not.
Uh, you know, maybe it's not even enough.

08:09.906 --> 08:10.781
-Hmm.
-Oh!

08:10.865 --> 08:11.741
-Great!
-Yeah.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.868
-I did have it professionally done.
-Oh…

08:13.951 --> 08:16.496
But I could always
zhuzh it up myself a bit.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.332
-Maybe I should give it a bit more height.
-Oh, no, it's just…

08:20.124 --> 08:23.044
It's just a perfect amount of height,
because there's just, um,

08:23.920 --> 08:24.837
so much height.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.172
I'm so pleased that you like it.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.133
It's just, with the journalists coming,
I really wanted to look nice today.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.718
-Yes.
-In case there's a photo op.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.802
Mm-hmm.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.765
Just between you and I,
I have been feeling so bad

08:35.848 --> 08:38.518
about how little I've been doing
to help Clark get the message out.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.605
So I just thought that it could help him
seem more legit, you know,

08:42.688 --> 08:45.066
if his coworkers looked
a little more professional.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.151
Oh, holy shit, Wendy.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.986
Who the hell jacked up your hair?

08:49.070 --> 08:52.448
It's super tall. It's like a skyscraper.
How did you even get it in here?

08:53.991 --> 08:54.909
Fuck you, Tom.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.203
You fuckin' prick.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.580
How fuckin' dare you
have a go at me 'cause of my hair?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.916
Okay, no F-bombs in the off--

09:02.542 --> 09:03.501
Whoa.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.879
He must like horses, as well.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.632
-You're lying to me, aren't you?
-Uh, no, I'm not.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.717
It looks-- it looks great.

09:12.343 --> 09:16.389
No, no, get real. "Whoa" means "stop"
when you're on a horse.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.933
And in this case, yeah,
absolutely, this is too much.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.268
-Stop.
-Oh, fuck it all!

09:20.351 --> 09:23.145
I wanna write him up.
Frisbee, I wanna write him up.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.438
-Write him up?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.357
Tom, Mohsin, let's just do it right now.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.697
Only the virtuous
can apsire to the heavens.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.035
And only God's children
can get one of these beauties.

09:43.916 --> 09:44.750
Can I help you?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.212
The question is, how can I help you?

09:49.547 --> 09:50.965
I'm sorry, who are you?

09:51.048 --> 09:52.675
I'm Satalinda.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.469
Satalinda? That's an interesting name.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.555
It's Romanian.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.640
A bear I know.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.684
But I know your name.

10:03.102 --> 10:08.816
I know everything about you,
because I intend to make you a star.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.652
Well, I'm already on television

10:11.736 --> 10:14.947
throughout Los Angeles, Orange County,
and parts of the Inland Empire.

10:15.031 --> 10:20.036
Hmm. I represent
a large streaming service,

10:20.119 --> 10:25.082
and we are looking for programming
to match our large religious audience.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.001
You've heard of
America's Own Holy Network?

10:28.336 --> 10:31.839
Amer-- Yes, of course. AOHN.
Ahone. Aoen. A-ohen.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.885
Look over this contract.

10:37.637 --> 10:43.309
I think you'll agree
that we are so impressed with your message

10:43.392 --> 10:46.896
"Only the righteous are right,"
that we are prepared to offer you

10:46.979 --> 10:49.523
an enormous amount of money
to continue your good work.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.109
Oh, yes. That's quite generous.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.736
It's a win-win.

10:54.278 --> 10:58.824
We'll get your righteous message
out to our enormous audience

10:59.617 --> 11:04.372
and you'll finally have
the vast platform you deserve.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.583
And get a very big check.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.086
-Oh…
-Long story short,

11:10.878 --> 11:11.837
we need you.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.298
And you can use us.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.634
However you like.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.553
Ooh…

11:20.680 --> 11:22.973
You deserve a bigger plane than that.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.559
-They fly higher.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.604
Closer to God.

11:38.906 --> 11:39.740
Right.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.540
Keep the pen.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.086
-I feel like--
-How many times--

11:52.169 --> 11:54.547
-What gives you the right--
-This meeting is a farce.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.464
-Guys.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.758
-It's the way I talk.
-"I can't get a date on Tinder."

11:57.842 --> 12:00.052
-Guys!
-…can't get a second date, it doesn't…

12:00.136 --> 12:01.470
-Guys!
-…to be mean to me!

12:01.554 --> 12:02.513
…in my rectum.

12:04.640 --> 12:09.145
Um… I need you to get back to work.
Also, to lower the temperature in here.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.857
So you're asking me
not to acknowledge my feelings

12:12.940 --> 12:14.984
or to acknowledge
an insult from a coworker?

12:15.651 --> 12:18.404
Sticky question.
I'm enjoying this dialogue. Thank you.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.156
Yes, great dialogue.

12:20.239 --> 12:24.201
What I am going to do
is I am going to ping corporate,

12:24.285 --> 12:27.246
and I am going to elevate the vis on this.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.039
-What's vis?
-Visibility.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
-Please just say visibility.
-Yeah.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.211
-Okay. Thanks for sunshining that for me.
-What the fuck does sunshining mean?

12:35.838 --> 12:39.383
S-- I heard it in a workshop.
It seemed positive at the time.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.218
Net-net, I'm trying to help.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.472
Also, no F-bombs. Please, no F-bombs.
I have to give you a flag.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.724
It's a verbal warning
if you do another F-bomb.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.477
If you write me up without writing Tom up,

12:49.560 --> 12:53.105
I promise you
that I will sunshine my little Kiwi foot

12:53.189 --> 12:54.190
straight up Tom's ass!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.484
Appendage insertion?

12:56.567 --> 12:59.653
I don't know what the big deal is.
You're threatening violence?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.198
All I said is her hair is super jacked up.

13:03.073 --> 13:06.744
It's something really positive
that I tried to help our friend, Tom.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.496
Okay, look, you're not hearing me.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.956
I never said you shouldn't try.
I said you failed.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.708
-Shut up, Tom!
-That came out bad.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.086
Okay. Verbal warning and a flag.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.172
Also, Tom. Not constructive.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.841
We need to build up, not tear down, okay?

13:21.425 --> 13:24.178
I just want to sunshine something

13:24.678 --> 13:27.306
and make sure that
we are all on the same page here,

13:27.389 --> 13:30.601
witnessing the same
paradigm-shifting thing.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.896
Our friend and our colleague,
Clark, is glowing.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.692
He is a beacon to God,
who I didn't even think existed.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.487
And we are all
trapped in the middle of it.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.115
The freaky possibilities
of how this could all play out

13:45.199 --> 13:46.784
are literally endless.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.744
We could be murdered by demons.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.665
We could be burned forever
by creaturey, underworld people.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.544
We could be-- we could be grabbed
and we could be flayed, skinned alive.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.379
Poked and prodded by pitchforks.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.007
Poked and prodded by pitchforks.
Now we're getting somewhere.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.303
My point is, team,
we are very likely very much screwed.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.849
So in the midst of all the madness,
I decided to do something positive

14:09.932 --> 14:12.601
by looking more professional
to help Clark seem more legit.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.188
So I put a bit more volume in my hair.
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.067
It was a devastating result
that I will rectify as soon as I can.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.703
Hello.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.455
You must be the reporter
that we've been expecting.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.583
-Yep.
-I'm Wendy.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.794
Um, for the record, I love your hair.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.254
Thanks.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.173
I'm also feeling really great about it,
actually.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.635
Clark, Judy.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.220
Thank you.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.142
So we'll do the interview with everyone?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.686
Yeah. I thought so, if that's okay.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.105
These guys have been
through all this with me.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.773
Mind if I record our conversation?

14:59.857 --> 15:00.733
Sure.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.652
So, who was the first person
to see Clark glow?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.446
-I--
-Amily saw him first.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.782
Which is something she could
have told you herself. Sorry.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.036
I might be a bit nervous, I, uh…
I just get a little…

15:12.119 --> 15:14.663
Whenever I'm being recorded,
I worry I might say the wrong thing.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.207
-Why, because you're a convict?
-No. It was just a misdemeanor.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.460
And you are…

15:19.543 --> 15:22.212
I'm Mohsin.
Uh, Mohsin Raza.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.340
Thank you.
I don't know why I told you my full name.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.550
Seems a bit formal.
Only my father calls me that.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.136
I don't have a very good relationship
with him. Mahmoud Raza.

15:29.219 --> 15:32.181
My brother's name is Muntezir Raza
and, uh, my sister is just Peggy.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.601
Because, you know, her name's Margaret,
oddly. You can call me Mo if you want.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.062
Feel free to stop talking
at literally any moment.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.563
-Great. Thank you.
-Yeah.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.440
So, Mo…

15:41.523 --> 15:43.484
-I'd prefer if you call me Mohsin.
-Okay.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.735
I thought you would. I--

15:44.818 --> 15:46.487
-You've never, ever said Mo.
-Yeah.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.616
Some people, including Reverend Throp,
have said Clark is performing tricks

15:50.699 --> 15:53.786
to gin up his popularity
and diminish organized religion.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.579
Is this some kind of hit piece?

15:55.663 --> 15:58.207
No, I just like to ask the more
uncomfortable questions

15:58.290 --> 16:01.001
at the beginning of the interview
so the rest is easier.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.295
All right. Well, we'll see, won't we?

16:04.463 --> 16:05.673
-So…
-Mm-hmm.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.593
Mohsin, in your opinion,
could Clark's glowing be a trick?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.971
It's definitely not a trick.
He's done it many times.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.391
Yeah. And if it was a trick,
how would he achieve that, even?

16:15.474 --> 16:18.352
He'd have to have some kind of a…
I don't know, magic remote control.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.853
-Where to keep it?
-Don't say butt.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.897
-Up your butt?
-Oh, yuck!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.525
-Do not go on.
-Please don't write that down.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.528
For the record, he glows.
We've all seen it.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.904
Something we've seen.

16:29.655 --> 16:34.159
And he's a good guy.
And I'm trying to be better, you know?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.704
Uh… to follow in his footsteps.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.832
'Cause sometimes I make mistakes.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.669
By the way, Wendy, I'm-- I'm sorry.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.296
That's okay. Thank you.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.382
Wow! Uh…

16:48.465 --> 16:51.093
It's nice to be forgiven. Feels good.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.930
Look, it-- it's really important
that when you write this article,

16:55.014 --> 16:56.849
you let people know that…

16:56.932 --> 17:01.228
Clark was chosen by D-O-G, God.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.521
He has dyslexia.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.772
Flip it. Flip it.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.233
How do you know that he was chosen?

17:06.316 --> 17:09.862
You know, it's a feeling that we all have.
Uh, plus he glows.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.406
And he smells like your favorite thing.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.365
-Mm. He does.
-Yeah.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.285
And it changes all the time.
It's different for everybody.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.580
You do smell
kind of like a dry chardonnay to me.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.790
Cool.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.588
Oh, hey there.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.049
Is it no pants day?

17:30.632 --> 17:33.469
-Who are you?
-I'm a friend of Clark's.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.722
-From work.
-Oh, you must be Amily!

17:38.515 --> 17:40.517
-And who are you?
-I'm Gene.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.935
I'm-- I'm Clark's dad.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.646
-No!
-Yeah. I've heard a lot about you.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.732
-Oh!
-I mean, uh…

17:46.815 --> 17:49.610
You know, my son has
a major, big-time crush on you.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.863
Oh, God. I wish I could
just erase what I just said.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.407
-I'll pretend I never heard it.
-Good.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.366
Oop… Pow!

17:56.450 --> 17:57.534
Thank you.

17:58.327 --> 18:02.414
Yeah, um, listen.
I'm just gonna reschedule with Clark.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.293
I mean, we usually, you know,
have a sauna on a Tuesday,

18:06.376 --> 18:08.921
but, you know, you guys,
you should hang out.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.381
You know, have a date.
You know, whatever it is.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.549
I'm not gonna say what it is

18:12.633 --> 18:15.969
because, you know, I don't wanna,
you know, overstep my boundaries of my--

18:16.053 --> 18:20.390
my precious son's new and--
and hopefully very serious relationship.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.976
-So I, uh--
-Please! Please stay.

18:23.644 --> 18:28.065
The truth is I've really been wanting
to meet you too. Clark will be along soon.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.401
Come on. Let's just hang out.
Get to know each other.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.695
Chew each other's fat.
Come on!

18:33.779 --> 18:35.531
I don't bite.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.367
You believe you glow
because you're a messenger of God.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.369
Uh…

18:40.452 --> 18:44.248
Well, I'm not so sure about
the significance of the glowing, per se?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.083
But when God spoke to me in the bathroom--

18:46.166 --> 18:47.543
-Wait. In the bathroom?
-Whoa, whoa…

18:47.626 --> 18:50.337
-Shut the front door.
-I'm sorry, Clark. God spoke to you?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.549
Sounds like something you should
disclose with the Council of Clark.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.384
-The Council of Clark?
-No.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.594
-It's not a real thing.
-God really spoke to you?

18:57.678 --> 18:58.637
Uh, yes.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.974
Um… I'm really sorry
I didn't get a chance to tell you guys.

19:02.057 --> 19:05.435
I feel like you could have found the time,
you know, to share this kind of news.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.771
Maybe over a scone.
"Hey, Mohsin. I met God."

19:07.855 --> 19:10.858
-Yeah. You're exactly right as usual.
-Thank you.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.778
Everybody in the Council of Clark
needs to know something of that magnitude.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.530
-Ew! Yuck! I said Council of Clark!
-Oh no!

19:16.613 --> 19:19.324
-Don't write that down.
-She said it again. So it's on the record,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.827
I'll just say
I am the leader of the Council of Clark.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.537
-Abbreviated CoC…
-You are not the leader.

19:23.620 --> 19:28.417
And that's not the takeaway there, Tom.
Clark, is God nice?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.544
She's very nice.
Yeah, which is good news, right?

19:30.627 --> 19:33.005
And I guess,
since we're sort of in the spirit…

19:33.088 --> 19:35.299
-of, uh, sharing, uh, things…
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.135
We've also met an archangel named Chamuel.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.595
-Chamuel?
-Oh my God.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.389
He's a lesser archangel,
but still, he's an archangel…

19:42.472 --> 19:45.684
You know, I guess the good news
about, uh, Chamuel, as well,

19:45.767 --> 19:50.814
is that, uh, he has been trying
to help us not get murdered by Satan.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.691
Who we also met.

19:52.774 --> 19:56.153
And she is an asshole.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.113
-Whoa.
-Whoa?

19:58.697 --> 20:01.116
-I knew you didn't like my hair.
-No, no, I meant--

20:01.200 --> 20:04.036
-Guys. Hey, hey, hey!
-I didn't mean it like that.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.454
-Your hair's…
-You did mean it!

20:05.537 --> 20:08.373
-I know, I'm well aware!
-Guys, guys. This is not the moment.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.376
I know you want lots of details
and have lots of questions.

20:11.460 --> 20:16.048
But right now, Clark's main mission is
to get this interview done. So let's…

20:16.548 --> 20:19.885
Tom! Stop staring
at the back of Clark's head. Come here.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.599
-It's just a lot to take in.
-Mm.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.143
Go ahead.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.146
-Ahem. Okay, so here we go.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.524
God is real and God is good.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.985
And everybody is actually
quite right about God.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.697
Meaning Jewish people,
or Christians, or Hindus, or Muslims,

20:40.781 --> 20:44.326
or the other organized religions,
or even the disorganized ones.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.203
Or people that are just spiritual.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.498
As long as you lead with love
and you do no harm,

20:49.581 --> 20:51.583
you're perfectly right about God.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.127
I think God wants there to be
a lot less fighting

20:54.211 --> 20:56.421
between people about their religions.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.258
God wants everyone to love each other
and to respect each other.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.179
I have so many
follow-up questions, but…

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
Clark, can you glow for me now?

21:06.723 --> 21:07.557
Oh shit.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.020
Just asking, Clark's Dad, but…

21:13.105 --> 21:14.648
Why are you just wearing a towel?

21:14.731 --> 21:18.652
Well, um, you know, when-- when Clark
and I pleasure ourselves in the sauna,

21:19.152 --> 21:21.905
um, I never know
what to do with my clothes,

21:21.989 --> 21:24.324
so, you know, I just thought
I would think outside the box.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.576
So I drove over here with just a towel on.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.080
How lucky is your car seat?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.415
What?

21:31.915 --> 21:33.834
Oh! Oh, jeez.

21:34.334 --> 21:38.255
Lucky car seat. Wow. That's… that's good.

21:38.338 --> 21:41.967
Oh, I wasn't kidding.
I wish I was your Hyundai.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.636
How do you know I drive a Hyundai?

21:48.307 --> 21:52.894
-Sorry, it doesn't always work right away.
-No worries. I have plenty of time.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.897
So just relax, Clark. Take your time.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.692
-There's no pressure.
-No, I think up. Up…

21:58.775 --> 22:00.527
Oh. Yeah, actually, it might…

22:00.610 --> 22:01.945
-Clark! Get in the game!
-Oh!

22:02.029 --> 22:03.864
Everything is resting on you!

22:03.947 --> 22:06.742
This is an apocalypse!
Everyone will die! Painfully!

22:06.825 --> 22:09.411
Your relatives! Our relatives! Children!

22:09.494 --> 22:12.622
-Dogs! Cats! Squirrels! Trees!

22:12.706 --> 22:14.958
Rabbits! Baby bunnies! Baby squirrels!

22:15.042 --> 22:17.544
Everything will die! It's on you!

22:17.627 --> 22:19.212
It's now or never!

22:20.714 --> 22:24.551
Thank you all for your help,
however weird it may have been.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.186
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

22:35.937 --> 22:37.731
No! No! I gotta go.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.276
Something terrible is gonna happen
to my dad. Judy, sorry, I have to go.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.362
-What about our interview?
-We can do it on the way.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.697
With Chamuel gone,
you're gonna need an angel on your side.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.368
-I can even drive.
-Hey, spoiler alert. Frisbee is an angel.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.078
-No he's not!
-I know.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.663
Just got my dream car, Clark.
She's a sweet ride.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.166
-Is it a midlife crisis car?
-Maybe.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.460
No, thank you.
I'll take my scooter and meet you there.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.921
Let's suit up, Counsel.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.297
-Stop saying that.
-No, you guys.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.716
This is the only place
we know for sure that you're safe.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.635
Stay here. We'll explain later.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.387
Okay. Good luck.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.222
-Go well.
-I love you.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.559
I'm sure your dad's gonna be fine.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.815
This is your midlife crisis car?

23:19.898 --> 23:22.401
I have wanted a lime-green Gremlin
my entire human life.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.944
But I mean, who doesn't, right?

23:24.027 --> 23:27.239
I'm not sure it's a totally common dream,
and I really need to see my Pop.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.282
Can't you teleport or fly or something?

23:29.366 --> 23:34.538
I can teleport between Heaven and Earth
but not with this kind of classic luxury.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.707
-Are you wearing driving gloves?
-Yeah, with this much vehicle,

23:37.791 --> 23:39.835
you gotta make sure
your hands stick to the wheel.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.629
-Please be careful! Watch it!
-Oh, oh, oh!

23:45.465 --> 23:47.801
I have a really hard time
believing you're an angel.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.428
Yeah, I get that a lot.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.056
Okay, we're here, kids.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.733
-How'd you get here so fast?
-Cut across backyards like I always do.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.318
Cool driving gloves.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.821
-Pop, where are ya?
-Back here!

24:08.530 --> 24:09.531
Hey, dummies!

24:10.198 --> 24:11.032
Satalinda?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.784
How do you know who she is?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.035
She was my date last night.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.913
We were having a really nice time,
and then, out of nowhere,

24:16.997 --> 24:18.957
she said I was stupid and ugly and left.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.500
What have you done with my Pop?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.670
He's in the sauna. Really sweatin' it out.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.214
Bye, Clark.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.512
Pop. Pop, are you okay? Oh, my God.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.974
You know, you're a real asshole!

24:36.057 --> 24:38.185
What do you expect?
I invented the asshole.

24:38.768 --> 24:42.355
You dodged that ball.
How about this one, bitch?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.857
Do something, Frisbee!

24:48.361 --> 24:51.198
-You're the worst.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.408
Okay, okay… Oh…

24:53.492 --> 24:54.367
Frisbee!

24:54.868 --> 24:56.203
Ah… Okay…

24:56.286 --> 24:58.705
Okay, just go easy. Go easy.
Yup, you're goin' up.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.000
You're okay, Pop. Pop, you're gonna
be okay. You're gonna be okay.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.836
-Oh, my God.
-Go easy with him. Go easy with him.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.713
Okay. Oh, my God, Pop. Pop.

25:06.796 --> 25:10.342
Frisbee, call an ambulance, okay?
Oh, Pop. I'm so sorry.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.219
Oh no.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.553
This is all my fault.
