WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:05.527
I'M POISON IVY.
I NEARLY KILLED SOMEONE,

00:05.570 --> 00:07.529
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
OR WHEN THIS INFECTION

00:07.572 --> 00:09.618
IS GONNA MAKE ME
TRANSFORM AGAIN.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.141
MARQUIS IS SICK.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.882
THERE WAS...
AN INCIDENT.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.319
THE JOKER HAD
THIS ZAPPER
ON HIS HAND.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.365
HE PRESSED IT AGAINST
MY SON'S FOREHEAD.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.542
AFTER THAT DAY,
HE WAS DIFFERENT, DARK,

00:20.585 --> 00:22.152
HORRIFYING.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.767
YOU FIGURED OUT SUNLIGHT
WAS MY TRIGGER.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.727
- UNH!
- AAH!

00:31.770 --> 00:33.207
DAD, HELP! HELP ME!

00:33.250 --> 00:35.905
YOUR DAD'S GONE,
LUKE.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.559
I TOOK OUT
YOUR FAILSAFE.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.875
WHAT UP, SIS?

00:49.919 --> 00:51.573
READY TO BLOW UP
THE GOTHAM
BUSINESS WORLD?

00:51.616 --> 00:53.183
WELL, WE GOT TO MAKE UP
FOR SKIPPING

00:53.227 --> 00:55.359
THAT REBELLIOUS
TEEN PHASE.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.318
GUESS THIS IS WHAT
IT WOULD HAVE FELT LIKE

00:57.361 --> 00:59.363
SNEAKING OUT OF THE HOUSE
UNDER JADA'S NOSE.

00:59.407 --> 01:02.149
YEAH, BUT INSTEAD
OF SMOKING BLUNTS
IN THE POOL HOUSE,

01:02.192 --> 01:04.542
WE'RE PLANNING
A CORPORATE MERGER
BEHIND HER BACK,

01:04.586 --> 01:06.370
A TRUE FAMILY
BUSINESS.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.893
SO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN

01:07.937 --> 01:09.504
IF YOU DON'T THINK
JADA WILL EVER GO FOR IT?

01:09.547 --> 01:11.114
WELL, THE FIRST THING
THAT WE GOT TO DO

01:11.158 --> 01:13.160
IS PROPOSE A PLAN
THAT EVERYONE LOVES,

01:13.203 --> 01:16.032
THEN USE THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.002
WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

01:30.046 --> 01:32.614
- YO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SORRY, MARQUIS.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.401
WHAT'S--WHAT'S
GOING ON?

01:43.799 --> 01:45.627
MOM, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

01:47.194 --> 01:51.415
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN
GOOD, BABY.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.287
- TAKE HIM.
- YES, MA'AM.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.354
YOU TOOK CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY,

02:17.398 --> 02:19.704
AND NOW YOUR FAMILY
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.882
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THIS FAVOR YOU NEED.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.678
LEAVES OF 3,
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.854
GOTHAM'S BOTANICAL GARDEN
WAS THE SITE

02:38.897 --> 02:41.552
OF SOME HORTICULTURAL HIJINKS
THAT SOURCES SAY

02:41.596 --> 02:43.119
BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE
TO THOSE

02:43.163 --> 02:46.296
OF GOTHAM SUPERVILLAIN
POISON IVY.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.299
THE TOXIC TROUBLEMAKER
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PAMELA ISLEY

02:49.343 --> 02:51.519
HASN'T BEEN SEEN
IN OVER A DECADE,

02:51.562 --> 02:54.435
BUT JUDGING BY THE SIZE
OF THE VINES FOUND AT THE SCENE,

02:54.478 --> 02:56.001
AUTHORITIES CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER IF THERE'S

02:56.045 --> 02:58.134
SOME OTHER ROOT CAUSE,

02:58.178 --> 03:00.658
OR DOES GOTHAM NEED TO
BREAK OUT ITS CALAMINE?

03:37.565 --> 03:40.176
MARY IS POISON IVY?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.612
WELL THAT DEPENDS.
SHE'S KIND OF GOT

03:41.656 --> 03:43.005
A JEKYLL AND HYDE
THING GOING ON,

03:43.048 --> 03:44.398
SO AT NIGHTTIME
SHE'S FINE,

03:44.441 --> 03:45.834
BUT WHEN THE SUN
COMES UP,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.662
THE SWEET AND LOVING
MARY THAT WE KNOW

03:47.705 --> 03:49.272
TAKES A BACKSEAT
TO A VEGETATION-WIELDING
SUPERVILLAIN.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.361
I'M GUESSING MARY'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ARM.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.928
YEAH. SHE MADE
HER POINT VERY CLEAR

03:52.971 --> 03:54.886
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME SUITING UP.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.324
SHE ALSO TRIED TO
SQUEEZE THE LIFE
OUT OF BATWOMAN.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.542
NO ONE'S SEEN HER
SINCE.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.935
IS THERE A WAY
TO CURE HER?

03:59.978 --> 04:03.112
NOT YET,
BUT THERE WILL BE.

04:03.155 --> 04:07.116
THERE WILL?
HOW EXACTLY?

04:07.159 --> 04:09.423
JADA HAS THE BEST MINDS
AT JETURIAN ON IT.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.338
I GAVE THEM A SAMPLE
OF MARY'S BLOOD.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.428
THEY'RE TRYING TO
SYNTHESIZE AN ANTIDOTE.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.386
YOUR MOM DOESN'T REALLY
DO ALTRUISM,

04:16.430 --> 04:18.867
SO WHAT'S IN IT FOR HER?

04:30.966 --> 04:33.751
HOW LONG
BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN
THE FREEZING PROCESS?

04:33.795 --> 04:36.711
AS SOON AS MY TECHS
CAN FLUSH HIS SYSTEM
OF ANY INTOXICANTS

04:36.754 --> 04:38.713
OR OTHER
CONTRAINDICATIONS.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.889
PLACING A HUMAN
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION

04:40.932 --> 04:43.152
IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.546
WE DON'T WANT TO
RUSH THINGS.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.112
THEN THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU
THE TIME TO FOCUS

04:47.156 --> 04:48.984
ON OUR OTHER PROJECT.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.855
WHERE ARE WE
WITH THAT?

04:50.899 --> 04:53.205
WELL, NO ONE HAS SEEN
A PLANT-BASED INFECTION
LIKE THIS

04:53.249 --> 04:54.685
SINCE SWAMP THING.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.167
BUT YOU CAN
ERADICATE IT.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.169
WE'RE SYNTHESIZING
THE ANTIDOTE NOW.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.740
SORRY I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE,

05:05.783 --> 05:07.394
BUT I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
UNTIL MARQUIS WAS IN CUSTODY.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.917
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.310
I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.007
HE IS UNSTABLE
AND DANGEROUS.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.226
I COULDN'T RISK
PUTTING ANYBODY ELSE
IN JEOPARDY.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.098
-  I GET IT.
-  WELL, I DON'T.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.100
SO YOUR MOM GOT
WHAT SHE WANTED,

05:18.143 --> 05:19.667
AND YOU REALLY JUST
TRUST THAT SHE'S
GOING TO DELIVER

05:19.710 --> 05:21.059
ON A CURE FOR MARY?

05:21.103 --> 05:22.539
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.367
JADA'S PEOPLE TESTED
MARY'S BLOOD.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.934
THEY BELIEVE THE INFECTION'S
DOUBLING EVERY 12 HOURS.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.588
AT THAT RATE,

05:27.631 --> 05:29.720
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST NIGHT
SHE'S STILL MARY.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.940
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?
- I RAN FACIAL RECOGNITION SWEEP

05:31.983 --> 05:33.463
OF EVERY CAMERA
IN GOTHAM,

05:33.507 --> 05:35.335
BUT NO PHONE SIGNAL,
NO CREDIT CARD ACTIVITY.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.814
HERE'S TO HOPING THAT
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN

05:36.858 --> 05:38.207
SHE'LL CALL US.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.385
IS THAT A HIT ON MARY?

05:42.429 --> 05:44.344
NO. IT'S ALICE.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.041
HER TRACKER SAYS
THAT SHE BREACHED

05:46.084 --> 05:47.825
HER 15-MILE
PERIMETER,

05:47.869 --> 05:49.392
SO SHE'S OFF LEASH
AND HAULING ASS

05:49.436 --> 05:51.046
OUT OF GOTHAM.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.439
YOUR ROOMMATE HAPPEN
TO TELL WHERE SHE WAS

05:52.482 --> 05:54.310
GOING THIS MORNING?

05:54.354 --> 05:57.574
I DIDN'T EXACTLY
GO HOME LAST NIGHT.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.885
GREAT. SO...
MARY'S IN THE WIND,

06:03.928 --> 06:06.322
AND NOW ALICE IS
MAKING A RUN FOR IT.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.108
YOU DON'T THINK MARY IS
WITH ALICE, DO YOU?

06:26.429 --> 06:29.171
WHY ARE WE
IN A MOTOR HOME?

06:29.214 --> 06:31.260
OH. BECAUSE WE WRECKED
OUR SUPERSEXY SPORTS CAR

06:31.303 --> 06:33.218
FLEEING THE GCPD.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.047
ALICE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.962
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT
WHAT I DID

06:38.006 --> 06:39.703
BUT, UH, IF YOU DON'T
REMEMBER,

06:39.747 --> 06:41.226
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.706
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
LISTEN TO?

06:42.750 --> 06:43.838
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO CHANGE THE STATION.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.927
ALICE, STOP.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.322
FINE.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
BUT WE WERE MAKING
REALLY GOOD TIME.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.246
I NEED TO CALL
RYAN AND LUKE.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.770
WHERE'S MY PHONE?

07:02.813 --> 07:04.293
OH, YOU THREW IT
INTO THE GOTHAM RIVER

07:04.336 --> 07:05.903
ON OUR WAY OUT.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.949
YOUR IDEA. BESIDES,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LET

07:07.992 --> 07:10.647
RY-RY AND HER
LITTLE SIDEKICK
COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.170
THEY'RE BOUND
TO BE SORE

07:12.214 --> 07:16.392
FIGURATIVELY
AND, UM, THE OTHER WAY.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.525
IS THIS LUKE'S
BATWING AI?

07:18.568 --> 07:21.266
OH, YEAH. APPARENTLY,
YOU JUST RIPPED IT
RIGHT OFF

07:21.310 --> 07:23.051
AND ALMOST TOOK
HIS ARM ALONG WITH IT.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.314
I SINCERELY HOPE HE'S
NOT LEFT-HANDED.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.146
BUT DON'T WORRY.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.061
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS BAD
AS WHAT YOU DID TO RYAN.

07:33.104 --> 07:36.064
OH, GOD.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.718
OH. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.415
OUR NEW RIDE HAS A TOILET.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.333
TRUST ME, SISTER.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.074
IT'S NICER THAN THE ONE
IN ARKHAM.

07:52.733 --> 07:56.084
RYAN AND LUKE WOULD NEVER
PUT ME IN THERE.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.260
WELL, IT'S NOT
LIKE YOU GAVE THEM
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.392
I MEAN, YOU DID TRY
TO KILL THEM,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.699
AND AS FOR RENEE MONTOYA
FINDING OUT ABOUT YOU,

08:02.743 --> 08:06.311
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT CACTUS IS
OUT OF THE BAG.

08:10.402 --> 08:13.275
I'M GONNA BE A FUGITIVE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.976
NO.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.198
JUST UNTIL YOU LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR POWERS,

08:23.241 --> 08:25.374
AND I'M HAPPY TO
KEEP YOU SAFE
UNTIL THEN.

08:25.417 --> 08:29.160
UHH. JUST OUT
OF THE KINDNESS
OF YOUR HEART?

08:31.423 --> 08:34.818
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION MY HEART ACTUALLY.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.038
CURRENTLY, I HAVE
THOUSANDS

08:37.081 --> 08:39.170
OF CREEPY NANOBOTS
RUNNING THROUGH
MY BLOODSTREAM,

08:39.214 --> 08:43.131
SENDING OUT ANNOYING
LITTLE TRACKING SIGNALS,

08:43.174 --> 08:47.744
AND IF THEY CAN FIND ME,
WELL...THEY CAN FIND YOU.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.314
THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO KNOW A DOCTOR

08:52.357 --> 08:56.666
WHO COULD DO A FULL BLOOD
TRANSFUSION, WOULD YOU?

08:56.710 --> 08:58.407
BUT THEN YOU'D GO FREE.

09:01.671 --> 09:06.720
SOMETIMES, YOU NEED TO
PICK YOUR POISON, DEAR.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.635
WHO DO YOU TRUST MORE
RIGHT NOW--

09:08.678 --> 09:13.161
YOUR FRIENDS, WHO WILL
SURELY LOCK YOU AWAY,

09:13.204 --> 09:17.644
OR YOUR SISTER, WHO'S
TRYING TO KEEP YOU FREE?

09:22.170 --> 09:23.475
WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

09:25.347 --> 09:26.740
TALL, DARK,
AND BROODING.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.524
YOUR BLOOD TYPE.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.702
O NEGATIVE.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.281
LUKE, ON COMMS: YOU'RE ABOUT
HALF A MILE FROM ALICE

09:46.324 --> 09:47.891
WEST ON I-15.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.810
OH, THAT'S WEIRD.
UM, SORRY. SIGNAL'S GLITCHY.

09:53.854 --> 09:57.292
LET ME JUST WIDEN OUT,
SEE IF I CAN GET A BETTER LOOK.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.120
UH-OH.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.035
NOT LIKING THE SOUND
OF THAT "UH-OH."

10:01.078 --> 10:02.993
TALK TO ME, LUKE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:03.037 --> 10:05.082
UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVE
ANOTHER TRACKER GOING EAST NOW.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.171
HOW THE HELL IS SHE
GOING EAST AND WEST?

10:07.215 --> 10:09.391
NO, WAIT. UH, NOW I HAVE
ONE GOING NORTH.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.958
I'VE GOT ALICES POPPING UP
ALL OVER THE MAP.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.699
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

10:12.742 --> 10:14.265
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.505
WHOA. BATWOMAN?
WHAT DID I DO?

10:36.548 --> 10:39.116
OH. I'M A BIG FAN.
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.378
OPEN THE TRUNK.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.906
NO SIGN OF ALICE
OR MARY.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.734
OK. WELL, I GOT ABOUT
20 OF THEM HERE,

10:47.777 --> 10:49.387
AND THEY'RE SCATTERING
IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.693
I--I DON'T GET IT.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.699
I DO. ALICE KNOWS
WE'RE TRACKING THE NANOBOTS

10:56.743 --> 10:58.483
IN HER BLOOD,
SO SHE'S SPILLING IT

10:58.527 --> 11:00.921
ON VEHICLES HEADING
IN EVERY DIRECTION
ON THE MAP,

11:00.964 --> 11:03.271
AND I KNOW WHY MARY
HASN'T CALLED US YET.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.708
SHE'S WITH ALICE.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.275
AND HOW WAS THE HOSPITAL?

11:07.318 --> 11:10.713
NOT NEARLY AS SECURE
AS IT SHOULD BE.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.976
I GOT IV TUBING,
BUTTERFLY NEEDLES,

11:13.020 --> 11:15.283
BLOOD COLLECTION BAGS
BUT NO BLOOD.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.459
AT LEAST THAT WAS
LOCKED AWAY.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.548
AND YET ONLY ONE
ICED CARAMEL LATTEÉ

11:19.591 --> 11:21.289
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
BIG ENOUGH TO SHARE.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.986
I NEED
THE CAFFEINE, OK?

11:23.030 --> 11:25.641
BEING TWO PEOPLE
IS EXHAUSTING.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.688
MMM. BEFORE YOU CALL ME
A SUCKY FUGITIVE,

11:28.731 --> 11:31.081
I PAID IN CASH,
AND I DIDN'T USE
MY REAL NAME.

11:31.125 --> 11:36.739
OH. OK. WELL, GOOD WORK...
DAPHNE.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.785
NOW I JUST NEED TO FIND
A DONOR.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.265
HONESTLY, I'M NOT PICKY.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.138
ACTUALLY, PICKY IS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU
NEED TO BE.

11:44.181 --> 11:47.358
YOU'RE O NEGATIVE,
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE
A UNIVERSAL DONOR,

11:47.402 --> 11:50.405
BUT YOU CAN ONLY
RECEIVE O NEG BLOOD.

11:50.448 --> 11:56.150
HMM. SO HOW DO WE FIND
THIS, UM, SPECIAL SOMEONE?

12:03.374 --> 12:04.549
HEY.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.773
YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN
FIND SO ATTRACTIVE
IN A GUY?

12:10.817 --> 12:13.558
IT'S NOT MUSCLES
OR A BIG BANK ACCOUNT.

12:13.602 --> 12:17.824
IT'S...
O NEGATIVE BLOOD.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.608
- BIG TURN-ON.
- MMM.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.088
SHOULD WE DO
A LITTLE CHECKSIES?

12:21.131 --> 12:22.524
UH, I'M GOOD.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.573
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE,

12:28.617 --> 12:30.445
BUT YOU TWO ARE FREAKING OUT
OUR CUSTOMERS

12:30.488 --> 12:33.317
WITH YOUR VAMPIRE KINK
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE INTO.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.406
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT
OUT OF HERE NOW!

12:35.450 --> 12:41.673
UHH. SORRY. YOU'RE
KICKING US OUT
OF THIS PLACE

12:41.717 --> 12:44.807
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE
TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE

12:44.851 --> 12:47.679
ON THE IMPORTANCE
OF KNOWING THEIR
BLOOD TYPE?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.466
YOU KNOW WHAT, MISS?
YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

12:51.509 --> 12:54.730
I AM SO SORRY.
STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.778
THAT WAS WEIRD.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.912
OH, MARE-BEAR.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.175
IT'S ABOUT TO GET
A LOT WEIDER.

13:05.219 --> 13:09.310
I THINK SOMEONE'S
MIND CONTROL PHEROMONES
JUST KICKED IN.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.834
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

13:11.878 --> 13:15.229
IT'S NIGHT,
AND I'M DEFINITELY
STILL MYSELF.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.318
WELL, GET READY
FOR THE MAKEOVER
OF A LIFETIME

13:17.361 --> 13:19.842
BECAUSE THIS MAY JUST
BE STEP ONE

13:19.886 --> 13:22.497
IN YOUR BLEND
TO FULL POISON MARY.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.630
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

13:25.674 --> 13:26.980
TAKE ANOTHER STAB
AT IT.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.593
HEY.

13:31.636 --> 13:34.901
CAN WE GET A BUNCH
OF SHOTS ON THE HOUSE?

13:34.944 --> 13:37.773
YOU GOT IT.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.211
SEE? PEOPLE
ACTUALLY LISTEN
TO THIS MARY,

13:41.255 --> 13:42.604
AND SHE GETS
FREE STUFF.

13:42.647 --> 13:45.563
I THINK I'M GONNA
LIKE HER.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.957
I JUST STOLE
FROM A SMALL BUSINESS,

13:48.001 --> 13:51.134
AND I DON'T EVEN
FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.396
YEAH.

13:55.573 --> 13:58.446
WELCOME
TO THE DARK SIDE.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.364
AHH.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.106
LUKE, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER
MARY'S GONNA BE MARY.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.369
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
A LINE ON WHICH
TRACKER'S THE RIGHT ONE.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.371
BLOOD CELLS CAN LIVE
OUTSIDE OF THE BODY
FOR UP TO 4-6 HOURS.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.026
WHEN THE BLOOD CELLS DIE OFF,
THE NANOBOTS WILL SHUT DOWN.

14:13.069 --> 14:16.333
THAT'S THE PLAN?
LITERALLY WAIT
FOR BLOOD TO DRY?

14:16.377 --> 14:18.031
HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE
BY SUN-UP

14:18.074 --> 14:19.684
SO WE CAN GET TO MARY
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.643
HEY. NOT TO ADD
TO OUR PROBLEMS,

14:21.686 --> 14:24.951
BUT IF SHE GOES
FULL-BLOWN POISON IVY,

14:24.994 --> 14:28.171
THE MAYOR HAS AUTHORIZED
EXTREME MEASURES.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.000
AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T
REALIZE THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT MARY.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.785
- WHO'S THEY?
- RENEE MONTOYA.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.309
WHEN DID SHE TELL
YOU THIS?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.835
SO SHE'S THE REASON YOU
DIDN'T GO HOME LAST NIGHT.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.445
YOU WERE WITH HER.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.925
DIDN'T REALIZE I NEEDED
YOUR PERMISSION.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
TO SLEEP WITH THE WOMAN
BLACKMAILING ME,

14:44.796 --> 14:47.321
THREATENING ME
WITH PRISON?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.018
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

14:49.062 --> 14:52.195
I AM SO HAPPY YOU TWO
FOUND EACH OTHER.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.544
UH, JUST GOT WORD
FROM JETURIAN.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.895
- THE CURE'S READY.
- COPY.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.113
LET'S GO.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.710
MAMA...

15:28.753 --> 15:31.060
MY HANDS STING.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.019
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

15:33.062 --> 15:35.673
YOU KNOW WHY, BABY.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.241
EVER SINCE THE JOKER
PRESSED THAT BUZZER
TO YOUR HEAD,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.678
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
THE SAME.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.506
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.639
I KNOW...

15:44.682 --> 15:46.423
AND I NEED TO FIX YOU

15:46.467 --> 15:47.990
BEFORE SOMEONE THAT
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

15:48.034 --> 15:51.820
TRIES TO PUT YOU AWAY
FOR GOOD.

15:51.863 --> 15:56.390
MAMA...I'M SORRY...

15:56.433 --> 15:59.784
FOR EVERYTHING.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.134
I LOVE YOU.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.627
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

16:21.154 --> 16:24.026
JUST TRUST ME
ON THIS.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.855
HAVEN'T I ALWAYS
TAKEN CARE OF YOU?

16:29.336 --> 16:30.815
WHEN YOU WAKE UP...

16:32.687 --> 16:36.560
YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY MARQUIS AGAIN.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.830
- AAH!
- RAAH!

16:45.874 --> 16:47.484
AAH! UNH!

16:47.528 --> 16:49.834
BACK OFF.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.880
YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING JADA JET?

16:51.923 --> 16:53.403
I WILL KILL HER.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.057
HUH YAAH!

16:55.101 --> 16:56.885
WHOA!

16:56.928 --> 16:58.626
MARQUIS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:02.151 --> 17:04.110
DOING WHAT YOU
TAUGHT ME.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.937
TAKING INITIATIVE.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.607
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

17:25.783 --> 17:27.742
MARQUIS. HE ESCAPED.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.265
-  OH, MY GOD.
-  HEY. TAKE IT EASY.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.180
DON'T TRY TO GET UP.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.487
I THOUGHT MARQUIS
WAS ON ICE.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.968
WE--WE FAILED.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.448
WHERE COULD HE BE NOW?

17:38.492 --> 17:40.363
RYAN...

17:40.407 --> 17:42.148
HE WENT LOOKING
FOR YOU.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.290
NICE SLING.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.031
MAKES YOU LOOK TOUGH.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.728
IS RYAN AROUND?

17:57.772 --> 18:00.253
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.081
- HOW DID YOU GET IN?
- AH. I TOLD THE STAFF

18:02.124 --> 18:04.561
AT THE FRONT DESK
RYAN AND I WERE BLOOD.

18:06.215 --> 18:10.089
HOO. 18-KARAT GOLD NIB,

18:10.132 --> 18:11.307
SATIN LACQUER FINISH.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.135
OOH! PRICEY.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.138
- AND HEFTY, TOO.
- CAN YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
THAT WAS A GIFT
FROM MY DAD.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.272
AH. SHOULD HAVE FIGURED.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.535
YOU KNOW, LUCIUS FOX
ALWAYS HAD THE BEST TASTE.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.885
YOU KNOW, YOUR OLD MAN
USED TO COME BY
OUR PLACE SOMETIMES

18:23.928 --> 18:26.801
FOR MY MOM'S FAMOUS
MOSCOW MULE NIGHTS.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.847
YEAH. WE'D SHOOT HOOPS
IN THE DRIVEWAY SOMETIMES.

18:29.891 --> 18:33.721
- GOOD MAN.
- DUDE...GIVE ME THE PEN.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.158
NO.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.508
THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. FOX?

18:38.552 --> 18:40.728
YEAH. IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. FOX?

18:40.771 --> 18:42.338
YOU CALLED SECURITY ON ME?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.644
YEAH. YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.036
ALL RIGHT. RELAX.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.299
LUKE AND I WERE
JUST CHILLING

18:46.342 --> 18:47.735
WHILE I WAIT
FOR MY SISTER.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.650
YOU MIGHT KNOW HER
AS YOUR BOSS.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.347
PLEASE ESCORT
MR. JET OUT.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.135
UGH!

19:03.881 --> 19:06.188
HERE'S YOUR PEN.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.147
UNH!

19:08.190 --> 19:10.932
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT.
YOU'RE QUICK.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.804
I WASN'T EVEN
WARMED UP YET.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.767
OHH! AAH! UGH! AGH!

19:23.988 --> 19:25.816
DON'T LIE TO YOURSELF.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.862
YOU WOULDN'T BEAT ME
WITH TWO GOOD HANDS.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.646
YOU READY TO WAVE
THE WHITE FLAG?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.484
GOOD NIGHT.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.406
YOU ARE SO AWESOME
TO CHECK MY BLOOD TYPE,

19:50.450 --> 19:53.366
BUT WHY ARE
YOU CHECKING MY BLOOD TYPE?

19:55.324 --> 19:58.632
BECAUSE IT'S
IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

19:58.675 --> 20:02.244
I MEAN, IMAGINE
IF YOU WERE IN
A NEAR-FATAL ACCIDENT.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.985
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO
RUN THE RISK

20:04.028 --> 20:06.422
OF BEING GIVEN
THE WRONG BLOOD.

20:06.466 --> 20:10.383
HEH. PLUS HOW ELSE
WOULD I BE ABLE
TO FIND OUT

20:10.426 --> 20:12.602
IF WE'RE COMPATIBLE?

20:12.646 --> 20:16.171
OH, OK.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.652
HMM.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.916
IT'S AB NEGATIVE.
IT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT,

20:21.959 --> 20:24.353
BUT THAT'S A VERY RARE
BLOOD TYPE, HIGH IN DEMAND.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.834
YOU SHOULD REALLY
CONSIDER DONATING
YOUR PLASMA.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.532
I'LL GO FIND A PLACE
TO DONATE NOW. OK.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.841
MARY,
THIS IS JASON.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.626
AHEM. JASON AND I
HAVE JUST BEEN TALKING

20:36.670 --> 20:38.324
ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS
TO MEET PEOPLE

20:38.367 --> 20:40.195
ORGANICALLY NOWADAYS.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.849
JASON HAS NO PIERCINGS,
NO TATTOOS,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.285
AND HE'S NEVER BEEN
TO A COUNTRY

20:43.329 --> 20:45.679
WHERE YOU CAN GET MALARIA.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.290
PLUS BONUS.
HE'S A GEMINI.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.205
YOU SAID THERE
WOULD BE WINGS.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.641
OH. TSK, TSK, TSK.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.992
THAT'S BAD FOR YOUR
CHOLESTEROL.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.907
PLACE YOUR HAND
RIGHT HERE.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.609
OH. NOW I WANT WINGS.

21:06.177 --> 21:11.226
OHH! O NEG.
WE HAVE A WINNER.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.662
HA HA HA!

21:12.706 --> 21:14.273
WHAT'D I WIN?

21:14.316 --> 21:19.103
YOU GET TO DONATE
2...3 PINTS

21:19.147 --> 21:22.019
OF YOUR BLOOD
FOR A VERY GOOD CAUSE.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.239
HA! I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CUT YOU OFF NOW.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.199
DR. TUVA DIDN'T
HAVE A SUBJECT

21:28.243 --> 21:29.810
TO TEST THE ANTIDOTE ON,

21:29.853 --> 21:31.202
BUT SHE'S CONFIDENT
THAT IT WILL WORK.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.856
WELL, THAT MAKES
ONE OF US.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.945
I JUST HOPE THERE'S
STILL TIME TO SAVE MARY.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.295
I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.557
I'VE MADE A LOT
OF MISTAKES,

21:37.600 --> 21:39.385
BUT I ALWAYS KEEP
MY PROMISES.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.258
IT SHOULD BE IN HERE.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.915
AAH!

21:54.443 --> 21:57.141
MARQUIS...

21:57.185 --> 21:58.839
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

22:00.623 --> 22:04.584
OH! LUKE! LUKE?

22:04.627 --> 22:08.544
CHILL.
HE'S ALIVE. I CHECKED.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.459
YOUR GUARD'S
ANOTHER STORY.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.770
YOUR FIGHT...
IS WITH ME.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.468
I'M THE ONE
WHO BETRAYED YOU.

22:19.512 --> 22:22.297
I GET WHY YOU'D BE
UPSET.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.300
I KNOW HOW AWFUL
THAT MUST HAVE FELT

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
TO HAVE YOUR SISTER
TURN AGAINST YOU.

22:29.435 --> 22:33.003
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

22:33.047 --> 22:34.570
HA HA HA!

22:34.614 --> 22:37.617
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
- HEH HEH. YOU.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.532
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS WOUNDED.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.621
YOU THINK I'M ALL
TORN UP INSIDE.

22:41.664 --> 22:44.580
OHH. MMM. SAD FACE
BECAUSE

22:44.624 --> 22:46.974
MY LONG LOST SISTER
STABBED ME IN THE BACK.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.933
- MARQUIS.
- HEH HEH.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.501
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PRETEND YOU'RE NOT HURT.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.982
RYAN, WHAT,
YOU DON'T GET IT?

22:55.025 --> 22:57.985
THIS IS ME FINALLY
NOT PRETENDING.

22:58.028 --> 23:01.510
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
BOUGHT INTO THE WHOLE
SIBLING BONDING CRAP.

23:01.554 --> 23:05.079
YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT WAS FOR ME TO KEEP
A STRAIGHT FACE?

23:05.122 --> 23:07.037
ME AND YOU
AGAINST THE WORLD, SIS.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.648
HEH HEH HEH.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.911
SO DESPERATE TO
CONNECT WITH THE FAMILY

23:10.954 --> 23:12.826
THAT DIDN'T WANT YOU.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.045
SEE, I WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT YEARS

23:15.089 --> 23:17.265
IN THE GROUP HOME WOULD
HAVE TOUGHENED YOU UP,

23:17.308 --> 23:19.398
BUT YOU STILL FELL
FOR IT.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.359
HA HA HA! WAIT.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.448
THE LOOK ON YOUR
FACE RIGHT NOW,

23:26.492 --> 23:27.971
IT MAKES IT ALL
WORTH IT.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.365
HOLD ON. LET ME
TAKE A PICTURE.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.019
USE THIS
AS MY BACKGROUND.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.239
- YOU'RE SICK.
- NOT AS SICK AS YOUR FRIEND.

23:35.283 --> 23:38.504
YEAH. MOM FILLED ME
IN YOUR LITTLE DEAL
BEFORE SHE BLACKED OUT.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.636
NOT OFF THE RED WINE
THIS TIME.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.902
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS STUFF IS,

23:45.946 --> 23:48.252
BUT BEING THAT YOU
WOULD HAVE SOLD OUT
YOUR OWN BROTHER FOR IT,

23:48.296 --> 23:50.603
I'M SURE IT'S IMPORTANT,

23:50.646 --> 23:54.955
AND CONSIDERING THAT
MOM'S TEAM HAD
A SUNRISE DEADLINE,

23:54.998 --> 23:57.348
WELL, I'D
SAY IT'S PRETTY
TIME-SENSITIVE, RIGHT?

23:57.392 --> 24:00.134
OHH!

24:00.177 --> 24:04.573
OK. HEH. OBVIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE A PRICE,

24:04.617 --> 24:07.402
SO LET'S GET TO THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS

24:07.446 --> 24:09.839
SINCE THE CLOCK
IS TICKING.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.799
ALL BUSINESS.
YEAH. ME, TOO,

24:12.842 --> 24:15.932
AND WHAT I WANT IS...

24:15.976 --> 24:18.892
YOUR AUTOGRAPH
ON A RESIGNATION LETTER

24:18.935 --> 24:20.415
OF YOU STEPPING DOWN
AS CEO

24:20.459 --> 24:23.418
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.117
OH. I ALSO WANT ALL
YOUR STOCK OPTIONS.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.641
OHH!

24:33.950 --> 24:35.909
YOU'RE TRYING TO WAGE
A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.085
YEAH, AND YOU'RE
GONNA HELP ME

24:38.128 --> 24:39.565
IF YOU WANT TO HELP
YOUR FRIEND

24:39.608 --> 24:41.044
IN A TIMELY FASHION,

24:41.088 --> 24:42.698
AND I'D SAY YOU GOT
ABOUT AN HOUR

24:42.742 --> 24:44.483
UNTIL SUNRISE.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.748
OH. DO YOU NEED A PEN?

25:10.421 --> 25:13.773
I REALLY WISH I WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN THE CHANCE
TO KNOW THE REAL YOU

25:13.816 --> 25:15.905
BEFORE THE JOKER
DESTROYED YOU.

25:19.300 --> 25:23.565
SEE? THAT'S THE THING.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.220
IF THE JOKER WAS
SO HORRIBLE,

25:26.263 --> 25:28.570
WHY WAS HE THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS DAMN CITY

25:28.614 --> 25:30.441
WHO LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
HAVING ANY FUN?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.099
THANKS.

25:59.253 --> 26:00.733
LUKE, I NEED A DIRECTION.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.257
I'M ALL DRESSED UP
WITH NOWHERE TO GO.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.693
UH, GOOD NEWS,
BAD NEWS?

26:04.737 --> 26:07.174
- BAD NEWS FIRST.
- OK.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.915
MARY HASN'T USED
HER CREDIT CARDS

26:08.958 --> 26:11.308
AND SHOCKINGLY
HASN'T POSTED ON INSTA,

26:11.352 --> 26:12.832
SO I DON'T HAVE
A BEARING TO GIVE YOU,

26:12.875 --> 26:14.747
AND WE ONLY HAVE
42 MINUTES
UNTIL SUNRISE.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.400
OK. YOU BETTER HIT ME
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.577
19 OF OUR TRACKERS
ARE OFFLINE,

26:18.620 --> 26:20.274
- SO WE'RE DOWN TO 4.
- THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

26:20.317 --> 26:21.536
I DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS THAT GOOD.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.798
SO YOU'VE GOT
A 1 IN 4 CHANCE

26:22.842 --> 26:24.583
OF PICKING THE RIGHT ONE.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.586
OK. LET ME KNOW IF
ANY OF THE TRACKERS BLINK OUT.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.902
LOOK. I'M NOT A DOCTOR,

26:39.946 --> 26:41.730
AND AT POINT ROCK,
MY FIELD DRESSINGS

26:41.774 --> 26:43.993
WERE FAMOUSLY TERRIBLE.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.390
I'M JUST TRYING TO CHANNEL
WHAT MARY WOULD SAY HERE.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.786
SHE'D TELL ME...

26:56.353 --> 26:59.966
SHE'D TELL ME THAT
THINGS CAN'T HEAL
UNLESS YOU LET THEM,

27:00.009 --> 27:02.882
AND SHE'D BE RIGHT
JUST LIKE SHE WAS

27:02.925 --> 27:04.797
ABOUT ME AND THE SUIT.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.977
AND JUST BECAUSE ARMOR
CAN COVER UP A WOUND

27:11.020 --> 27:14.937
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
IT'S NOT STILL THERE.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.070
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WHEN SHE TRIED TO HELP ME?

27:18.985 --> 27:20.682
I PUSHED HER AWAY.

27:23.206 --> 27:26.557
BECAUSE I JUST
ASSUMED THAT SHE'D
ALWAYS BE THERE.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.560
WELL, I TOOK MY EYES
OFF ALICE

27:29.604 --> 27:32.433
TO SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH RENEE,

27:32.476 --> 27:35.131
SO IF YOU'RE HAVING
A GUILT PARTY,

27:35.175 --> 27:36.872
MAKE ROOM FOR ONE MORE.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.701
SO THAT'S HOW ALICE
GOT OUT?

27:39.745 --> 27:41.398
YOU AND RENEE ARE
A THING NOW?

27:41.442 --> 27:43.618
WE'RE NOT A THING.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.055
WE HAD A THING,
WHICH TECHNICALLY

27:46.099 --> 27:48.623
DIDN'T EVEN LAST
TILL BREAKFAST,

27:48.667 --> 27:52.758
WHICH SAYS A LOT
CONSIDERING SHE LIVES
ABOUT A G.C. JITTERS.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.720
THAT'S IT. COFFEE.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.287
THAT'S HOW
WE FIND MARY.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.028
HOW? SHE'S NOT USING
HER CREDIT CARDS.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.769
YEAH, BUT IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT

28:03.812 --> 28:05.422
A SLEEP-DEPRIVED
MARY HAMILTON CANNOT
LIVE WITHOUT,

28:05.466 --> 28:08.730
IT IS COFFEE,
AND...

28:08.774 --> 28:10.732
YEAH. SHE USED
HER REWARDS CARD

28:10.776 --> 28:13.300
AT A G.C. JITTERS
OUTSIDE OF METROPOLIS

28:13.343 --> 28:15.650
TWO HOURS AGO.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.740
THAT'S OUR MARY.
LEAVE NO REWARD
POINT BEHIND.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.829
LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.225
OK. SO THE NEAREST
TRACKER TO THAT

28:25.268 --> 28:27.836
G.C. JITTERS
LOCATION IS...

28:27.880 --> 28:30.404
BROWNSVILLE PUB?

28:34.321 --> 28:37.454
ENOUGH O NEG
FOR A WHOLE HUMAN.

28:37.498 --> 28:40.022
IT IS AMAZING WHAT
TWO PEOPLE

28:40.066 --> 28:41.981
WITH NARY A CONSCIENCE

28:42.024 --> 28:44.287
BETWEEN THEM CAN PULL OFF.

28:44.331 --> 28:47.160
I HOPE THIS GOES BETTER
THAN MY LAST TRANSFUSION.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.033
NOCTURNA.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.906
YOU WERE THERE.

28:53.949 --> 28:57.300
RIGHT. YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAVED
YOUR OWN SKIN

28:57.344 --> 29:00.782
BY SICCING THAT
OFF-BRAND VAMPIRE
ONTO MOI

29:00.826 --> 29:02.262
BY LURING HER
WITH THE FACT

29:02.305 --> 29:03.916
THAT I HAD DESERT ROSE
IN MY BLOOD,

29:03.959 --> 29:08.485
WHICH WAS ONLY THERE
BECAUSE YOU GAVE MY MOM

29:08.529 --> 29:09.965
THE CHOICE BETWEEN
HER OR ME

29:10.009 --> 29:12.968
WITH ONLY ONE CURE
BETWEEN US?

29:13.012 --> 29:16.058
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

29:16.102 --> 29:19.235
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY,
HAVEN'T WE?

29:19.279 --> 29:23.892
HMM. YOU KNOW,
FOR SO LONG,

29:23.936 --> 29:28.505
ALL I WANTED WAS
FOR YOU TO BE
OUT OF MY LIFE.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.551
I SHOULD JUST STICK
AN EMBOLISM IN YOUR IV

29:30.594 --> 29:32.727
AND FINALLY JUST
BE DONE WITH YOU.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.817
AHEM. HEH HEH.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.124
OR, UH, OPTION "B,"

29:38.167 --> 29:40.430
YOU COULD FINISH
MY OIL CHANGE,

29:40.474 --> 29:42.693
AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO
SEE ME AGAIN.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.744
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.097
HARD TO BELIEVE,
RIGHT?

29:55.141 --> 29:56.707
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
ALONE.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.407
I KNOW THE FEELING.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.807
BUT YOU WON'T BE.

30:08.850 --> 30:12.506
I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU
THROUGH THIS WHOLE
MARY METAMORPHOSIS.

30:14.725 --> 30:18.817
YOU'D BE A LOT EASIER
TO TRUST IF YOU WEREN'T
A SERIAL KILLER.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.862
A SERIAL KILLER
WHO HASN'T LEFT YOU,

30:20.906 --> 30:23.952
DOUBTED YOU,
OR IGNORED YOU.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.783
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
ALONE RIGHT NOW,

30:28.827 --> 30:32.047
OR DO YOU WANT HELP
FROM THE ONLY FAMILY
YOU HAVE LEFT?

30:45.887 --> 30:47.671
- MARQUIS?
- HI, MOM!

30:47.715 --> 30:49.935
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.721
HA! MADE YOU LOOK.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.201
WHY ARE YOU CALLING?

30:55.244 --> 30:56.767
TO TELL YOU TURN ON
THE TV TOMORROW,

30:56.811 --> 30:59.683
9 A.M. SHARP,
ANY CHANNEL.

30:59.727 --> 31:02.121
- WHY?
- BECAUSE, MAMA,

31:02.164 --> 31:04.558
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
SO PROUD.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.573
BYE-BYE, LITTLE ROBO NARCS.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.314
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
RID OF THESE LATER.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.229
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

31:23.272 --> 31:26.101
LIKE MY DONOR SHOULD TAKE
AN UBER HOME.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.669
GIRAFFES OR ELEPHANTS?

31:28.712 --> 31:31.019
ELEPHANTS. THEY HAVE
LONGER MEMORIES.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.154
I KNOW WE WEREN'T
EACH OTHER'S...

31:35.197 --> 31:36.807
FIRST CHOICE
IN THE SISTER DEPARTMENT,

31:36.851 --> 31:39.071
BUT I'M, UM...

31:39.114 --> 31:40.899
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.944
KATE WOULD HAVE NEVER
DONE THIS FOR ME.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.033
HARD SAME.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.949
KATE WOULD HAVE NEVER
LET ME DO ANYTHING.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.691
AT LEAST YOU BELIEVED
I WAS CAPABLE

31:50.734 --> 31:53.563
OF DOING MORE THAN
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
EXPECTS OF ME.

31:53.607 --> 31:56.218
WELL, I'M GLAD THE NEW YOU
FINALLY AGREES

31:56.262 --> 31:57.828
THAT EVERYONE SUCKS.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.049
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST SIGN
OF SPROUTS,

32:01.093 --> 32:04.183
KATE WOULD HAVE LOCKED YOU
AWAY IN ARKHAM.

32:04.226 --> 32:10.363
YEAH. THEN SHE WOULD
HAVE FELT REALLY BAD
ABOUT IT IN HER JOURNAL.

32:10.406 --> 32:11.973
HEH!

32:13.540 --> 32:14.889
POLICE!
YOU'RE IN POSSESSION

32:14.933 --> 32:16.282
OF A STOLEN VEHICLE!

32:16.325 --> 32:18.153
EXIT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

32:18.197 --> 32:19.981
UH, THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO USE
YOUR PHEROMONE POWERS.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.070
I CAN'T DO IT
THROUGH THE DOOR.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.854
YOU WANT TO OPEN UP?
I DON'T.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.861
STOP!

32:30.905 --> 32:32.515
OH, MY GOD! STOP!

32:35.431 --> 32:36.998
I THINK WE HIT HIM.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.521
I THINK THAT'S
A REASON TO KEEP GOING.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.745
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK WE MISSED
HIM WITH THE WHEELS.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.618
HE PROBABLY HAS
A CONCUSSION.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.011
HE NEEDS A RIDE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.447
I'M SURE ONE
WILL COME ALONG.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.840
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
THAT PERSON.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.363
I CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM!

32:54.407 --> 32:56.017
THE OLD YOU
CAN'T LEAVE HIM.
REMEMBER HER?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.714
THE ONE WHO PUTS EVERYONE'S
NEEDS ABOVE HER OWN

32:57.758 --> 32:59.107
AND NEVER GETS
ANYTHING IN RETURN?

32:59.151 --> 33:01.327
THE NEW YOU PUTS
HERSELF FIRST, HMM,

33:01.370 --> 33:03.329
AND LEAVES BEHIND
ANYONE WHO TRIES TO STOP HER.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.026
HOBBIES INCLUDE
LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH

33:05.070 --> 33:07.202
AND NOT BEING
INCARCERATED.

33:09.509 --> 33:13.426
SORRY, OLD ME.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.210
WE NEED TO DITCH
THE NANOBOTS.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.486
- PUNCH IT!
- CONSIDER IT PUNCHED!

33:30.530 --> 33:32.053
WHOO-HOO!

33:37.754 --> 33:39.669
HOW FAST DOES
THIS THING GO?

33:42.281 --> 33:43.847
WHY'D YOU STOP?

33:43.891 --> 33:45.284
I DIDN'T.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.078
SO CLOSE.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.471
MARY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.909
- WE HAVE A CURE.
- A CURE? HOW?

34:01.952 --> 34:04.346
IT'S A LONG STORY,
BUT WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.741
IT'S PROBABLY THE LAST NIGHT
YOU'RE YOU, BUT LOOK.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.787
THIS WILL STOP
THE INFECTION.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.354
YOU COULD BE YOU AGAIN.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.269
THE OLD YOU,
THE ONE THEY CAN USE,

34:14.313 --> 34:15.966
THE ONE THEY
CAN IGNORE

34:16.010 --> 34:17.446
UNTIL THEY NEED TO
TROT HER OUT

34:17.490 --> 34:18.621
FOR BATTEAM ASSEMBLE.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.971
YOU KNOW HOW WE
FOUND YOU?

34:21.015 --> 34:22.582
LUKE KNEW YOU COULDN'T
RESIST COLLECTING

34:22.625 --> 34:25.802
YOUR DAMN G.C. JITTERS
POINTS.

34:25.846 --> 34:29.980
THAT'S WHAT BEST FRIENDS
KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER, MARY.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.200
LOOK AT ME!

34:32.244 --> 34:34.159
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
TO BELIEVE IN ME.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.943
NOW I NEED YOU
TO DO IT AGAIN.

34:35.986 --> 34:38.685
THERE THEY GO,
TELLING YOU
HOW TO THINK.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.469
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
IN ARKHAM.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.210
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
THAT WAY.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.477
PROMISE?

34:50.958 --> 34:53.787
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ME
IF I DON'T TAKE THE CURE?

34:53.830 --> 34:57.182
I WOULD HAVE TO KEEP YOU
CONFINED UNTIL WE
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

34:57.225 --> 35:00.315
WE CAN'T JUST LET YOU
HURT PEOPLE.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.882
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.453
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

35:07.496 --> 35:09.455
MARY, I AM TRYING
TO SAVE YOU.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.109
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T
WANT TO BE SAVED.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.023
THIS ISN'T YOU TALKING.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.025
NO. THIS IS YOU
NOT LISTENING.

35:15.069 --> 35:17.245
IF YOU THINK THAT
I'M NOT MYSELF,

35:17.289 --> 35:19.813
THEN YOU DON'T
KNOW ME AT ALL.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.606
HA HA HA!

35:35.220 --> 35:36.873
IT'S TIME I STEP
OUT OF YOUR SHADOW

35:36.917 --> 35:40.181
AND INTO MY OWN SUNLIGHT.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.530
UNH!

36:09.341 --> 36:11.256
WHERE'S MARY?

36:11.299 --> 36:14.172
SHE'S NOT MARY
ANYMORE.

36:14.215 --> 36:17.653
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE SAVED.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.439
BUT WE'RE NOT GIVING UP
ON HER.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.137
YOU DON'T GET IT.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.748
I THINK SHE'S
GIVEN UP ON US.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.854
ALL OF GOTHAM
IS ROCKED

36:44.898 --> 36:46.378
BY THIS STUNNING
NEW DEVELOPMENT.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.424
THE SURPRISE RESIGNATION
OF CEO RYAN WILDER

36:49.468 --> 36:51.644
HAS LEFT WAYNE ENTERPRISES
VULNERABLE

36:51.687 --> 36:53.515
TO A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.561
WHAT THIS MEANS
FOR THIS LEGENDARY PILLAR

36:55.604 --> 36:57.476
OF GOTHAM CITY IS STILL
A MYSTERY,

36:57.519 --> 37:00.305
BUT WE ARE STANDING BY HERE
AT WAYNE TOWER,

37:00.348 --> 37:03.830
WHERE WE ARE TOLD
THE NEW CEO OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES

37:03.873 --> 37:05.962
WILL BE MAKING
A STATEMENT SHORTLY.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.269
NOW YOU KNOW
WHY THE BATMOBILE'S
PARKED AT A METER.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.967
NEWS VANS COMPLETELY
BLOCKING THE GARAGE.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.926
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO GET IN ANYWAY.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.015
OUR SECURITY CLEARANCES
HAVE BEEN REVOKED.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.365
WE ARE OFFICIALLY SHUT OUT
OF WAYNE TOWER.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.324
WHAT ABOUT THE BATCAVE?

37:19.367 --> 37:21.195
I BARELY HAD ENOUGH TIME
TO INITIATE THE LOCKDOWN,

37:21.239 --> 37:23.719
BUT, YEAH,
THE BATCAVE IS SEALED.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.765
WE'RE NOT GETTING
BACK IN THERE,

37:25.808 --> 37:29.551
BUT WE HAVE THE BATSUIT,
THE BATMOBILE,

37:29.595 --> 37:31.205
AND NOT MUCH ELSE.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.342
I AM SO SORRY, LUKE.

37:37.385 --> 37:40.780
I TRADED AWAY
THE WAYNE LEGACY
FOR NOTHING.

37:43.348 --> 37:46.046
YOU DID IT FOR MARY.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.569
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

37:53.314 --> 37:57.492
GOOD MORNING,
CITIZENS OF GOTHAM!

37:57.536 --> 38:00.974
I AM HONORED AND PROUD
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF

38:01.017 --> 38:03.455
AS THE NEW LEADER IN BUSINESS.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.283
YOU SEE, AS TIMES ARE CHANGING,

38:05.326 --> 38:08.503
IT IS TIME THAT WE SEE
THE BIG MONEYMAKERS FOLLOW SUIT.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.418
NOW I NOW THIS TOWN
SEES ME AS A BIT

38:10.462 --> 38:13.639
OF A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR,
BUT AS THE NEW CEO

38:13.682 --> 38:15.380
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

38:15.423 --> 38:17.556
I PROMISE YOU A FRONT ROW SEAT

38:17.599 --> 38:20.167
TO THE BLEEDING EDGE
OF THE INDUSTRY,

38:20.210 --> 38:22.474
WHERE YOU'LL NOT ONLY SEE
INSPIRING INNOVATION

38:22.517 --> 38:24.476
FROM VISIONARY THOUGHT LEADERS,

38:24.519 --> 38:28.218
BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE FUN.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.526
WHILE I WAS HIRED
TO FILL THE COFFERS

38:31.570 --> 38:33.833
OF MY SHAREHOLDERS,

38:33.876 --> 38:39.317
MY MAIN MISSION IS TO PUT
A SMILE ON EVERYONE'S FACE.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.537
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I WORKED
ALONGSIDE MY MOTHER JADA JET...

38:42.581 --> 38:46.976
MMM. I AM SO HUNGOVER.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.848
THEN AGAIN, I WAS
PRACTICALLY TURNING

38:48.891 --> 38:52.373
INTO THE HUMAN VERSION
OF A LONG ISLAND
ICED TEA LAST NIGHT.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.071
I NEED HASH BROWNS
AND COFFEE STAT.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.944
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
TAKING YOU SO LONG?

38:57.987 --> 39:01.817
YOU KNOW,
AS MUCH AS I MAKE IT
LOOK EFFORTLESS,

39:01.861 --> 39:05.255
IT TAKES TIME TO MAKE
BAD LOOK THIS GOOD.

39:10.391 --> 39:16.092
MY...HOW YOU HAVE
BLOSSOMED.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.880
I THINK YOUR
DIABOLICAL DEBUT

39:20.923 --> 39:23.970
DESERVES MORE THAN
A ROADSIDE GREASY SPOON.

39:24.013 --> 39:27.539
I DON'T CARE WHAT WE DO
OR WHERE WE GO

39:27.582 --> 39:30.150
AS LONG AS IT'S FUN.

39:30.193 --> 39:34.546
AND NOW I CALL YOU TO JOIN ME
AT THE PEAK OF GREATNESS.

39:34.589 --> 39:38.854
HMM. WELL, HE CERTAINLY
LOOKS LIKE FUN.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.319
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
