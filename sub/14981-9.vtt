00:04.329 --> 00:06.764
Some of the best poker players in the world

00:06.830 --> 00:09.633
have survived to battle for the 2009

00:09.701 --> 00:12.002
poker world championship ring.

00:12.070 --> 00:13.570
Let's meet your host,

00:13.638 --> 00:16.573
the most powerful man
on the las Vegas strip,

00:16.641 --> 00:19.243
the owner of the Nouveau
Royale hotel and casino,

00:19.310 --> 00:20.844
Hugh Ellis.

00:20.912 --> 00:22.179
How are you?

00:22.247 --> 00:23.914
Let's meet the players.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.316
First up is the lovely Poppy Wells.

00:26.384 --> 00:29.052
Poppy brings a sizeable
chip stack and quite a view

00:29.120 --> 00:31.088
to the final table.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.490
And here comes the Russian playboy

00:33.558 --> 00:36.026
Vas Belanov!

00:36.094 --> 00:38.428
I appreciate your help, Mr. Tostevin.

00:38.496 --> 00:41.431
Hey, I get paid for my services, kid.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.867
No thanks required.

00:43.935 --> 00:45.602
Get a good night's sleep.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.672
The hard work starts tomorrow, ok?

00:49.908 --> 00:51.775
In his sixth final table appearance,

00:51.843 --> 00:53.944
It is my honor to introduce to you,

00:54.012 --> 00:55.445
from Springfield, Massachusetts,

00:55.513 --> 00:58.182
poker legend Mason Brock.

00:59.017 --> 00:59.950
Shut up!

01:00.018 --> 01:01.552
What are you doing here?

01:01.619 --> 01:03.821
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

01:03.888 --> 01:06.523
You have no right to ask me what I'm doing here.

01:06.591 --> 01:08.292
It's none of your business.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.194
After a nail-biter showdown with Ricky Nguyen

01:10.261 --> 01:11.962
to make it to this final table,

01:12.030 --> 01:15.165
here comes the rock star of
the South American poker scene,

01:15.233 --> 01:16.867
Amadeo valdez.

01:16.935 --> 01:18.969
Get out of here!

01:26.811 --> 01:29.713
And last, but definitely
not least,

01:29.781 --> 01:32.416
The lone amateur to make it
to the final table,

01:32.483 --> 01:34.918
The golden boy
from evergreen park, Illinois.

01:34.986 --> 01:37.521
Where's that, you ask?
No one knows.

01:37.589 --> 01:40.557
This kid came out of
nowhere to sweep through
the early rounds

01:40.625 --> 01:42.793
in a merge as chip leader.

01:42.861 --> 01:45.896
It's been 3 months since he
conquered over 6,000 players

01:45.964 --> 01:49.499
to make it to this, the final table of the 2009

01:49.567 --> 01:51.101
poker world championship.

01:51.169 --> 01:52.769
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:52.837 --> 01:54.104
Jake Hartman!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.916 --> 02:06.483
Missing.

02:07.819 --> 02:11.822
And you lot are the prime
suspects in his disappearance.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.062
I'll be damned. Never
thought I'd live to see it.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.230
See what?

02:20.298 --> 02:23.634
The day they let cal Lightman back in Vegas.

02:54.899 --> 02:57.334
If you don't cooperate fully with Dr. Lightman,

02:57.402 --> 02:58.802
you won't be at the final table

02:58.870 --> 03:00.170
when we go live in 32 hours.

03:00.238 --> 03:02.940
You got it? They're all yours.

03:03.775 --> 03:06.043
Professional liars.

03:07.679 --> 03:09.079
That's a treat.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.015
I think I'll start with Jake first, actually.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.717
I'd like to see his room,

03:13.785 --> 03:14.918
meet the missis.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.820
Cal, there is a time pressure here,

03:16.888 --> 03:19.089
and if anyone from the final table is involved,

03:19.157 --> 03:21.024
folks are gonna say the championship is rigged.

03:21.092 --> 03:22.459
I could lose the whole thing to another casino.

03:22.527 --> 03:24.061
Worst case, I lose my gaming license.

03:24.128 --> 03:25.329
Oh, we can't have that, can we?

03:25.396 --> 03:26.563
Here's the deal.

03:26.631 --> 03:28.365
You find Jake, get him to the final table,

03:28.433 --> 03:30.634
there's a half a million bonus in it for you.

03:30.702 --> 03:33.337
Why is he so important to you, again?

03:33.404 --> 03:36.106
I just told you.

03:53.257 --> 03:54.825
So what's the history with these two?

03:54.892 --> 03:57.594
Ellis had Lightman banned from Vegas.

03:57.662 --> 03:58.929
The entire city?

03:58.997 --> 04:01.698
Cal won a lot of money from
some very important customers.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.900
His scientific abilities
weren't considered sporting.

04:03.968 --> 04:07.537
Well, you ban somebody from an
entire city, that's personal.

04:07.605 --> 04:08.939
Well, there may have been a situation

04:09.007 --> 04:11.441
with Ellis' girlfriend at the time.

04:11.509 --> 04:13.543
Vegas doesn't bring out the best in Cal.

04:13.611 --> 04:16.313
Ben, keep an eye on him while we're here

04:16.380 --> 04:18.615
and don't let him gamble, ok?

04:18.683 --> 04:20.216
Why? So he won't win?

04:20.284 --> 04:22.953
He wins at poker, but it's no fun for him.

04:23.021 --> 04:24.388
What's his game?

04:24.455 --> 04:27.324
Roulette. Unpredictable,
purely driven by chance,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.026
and the worst odds in the casino.

04:34.465 --> 04:36.533
God, I miss this.

04:44.008 --> 04:45.909
Think I'll put a bet on... 

04:45.977 --> 04:48.678
I did not bring you here
to indulge your bad habits,

04:48.746 --> 04:50.647
and you will be stopped if
you try to leave my property.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.349
What, you don't want
your buddies to find out?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.517
It's Vegas. They already know.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.818
But it's better for the both of us

04:54.886 --> 04:55.952
if you keep a low profile.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.291
That's my cue. I'll see you suckers later.

05:01.359 --> 05:02.692
No, no, where are you going?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.628
Hey, a free private plane ride to Vegas.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.029
My mama ain't raised no fool.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.064
And as far as I can tell,

05:07.131 --> 05:09.800
there's no crime here, so...

05:09.867 --> 05:11.201
Hey, I brought you here to work.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.136
Yeah, I'll work when there's
something for me to do.

05:13.204 --> 05:15.305
But until then, right now I'm feeling lucky, ok?

05:15.373 --> 05:17.808
Hey, I'm not done with you yet.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.844
Say it... "but I'm done with you." Say it loud.

05:20.912 --> 05:22.646
But I'm done with you.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.047
Good. Now, take this.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.650
Put it all on double zero
on the roulette, will you?

05:26.717 --> 05:28.251
Yeah, all of it. All of it?

05:28.319 --> 05:30.153
Yeah. The whole thing.

05:30.221 --> 05:32.222
Don't let Foster find out?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.223
All right?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.225
All right.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.993
Do you believe that guy?

05:37.061 --> 05:39.229
Come on, let's get going.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.735
Your husband is a star.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.737
Jake would never just leave us.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.573
He loves us. Please find him.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.176
I think you should just call the police.

05:53.244 --> 05:54.845
If you think that's necessary, Cal,

05:54.912 --> 05:57.214
but I think you're more than
qualified to find him yourself.

05:57.281 --> 06:00.283
This one told you not to, didn't he?

06:00.351 --> 06:03.520
Macey just didn't think it
was necessary once I hired you.

06:03.588 --> 06:05.021
Well, here's the thing.

06:05.089 --> 06:07.524
Mr. Ellis here doesn't want the police involved

06:07.592 --> 06:08.892
because you're husband's a commodity,

06:08.960 --> 06:11.461
one he's put a lot of effort into packaging.

06:11.529 --> 06:12.696
He wants him back at the final table,

06:12.763 --> 06:13.964
but without the bad publicity.

06:14.031 --> 06:17.267
He said the police wouldn't take me seriously.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.703
People wander off in Vegas all the time,

06:19.770 --> 06:20.704
He said.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.807
You know, well, that bit's true... too.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.176
I just wanted us all to be
clear on our motives here.

06:26.244 --> 06:27.177
All right?

06:27.245 --> 06:29.146
Yeah?

06:31.282 --> 06:33.984
There's a young man missing.

06:34.051 --> 06:35.552
Let's focus on that and not on Ellis

06:35.620 --> 06:36.786
or anything from the past, ok?

06:36.854 --> 06:38.889
One job is Vegas isn't going to turn me

06:38.956 --> 06:40.557
back into an inveterate gambler.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.726
Of course not. But you have to understand

06:42.793 --> 06:44.461
the pull that this town has on you.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.663
Things change. But people don't.

06:46.731 --> 06:50.133
You're smothering.
There's no smothering in Vegas.

06:51.602 --> 06:54.404
Tell me about the last time
you saw your husband.

06:54.472 --> 06:55.805
2 nights ago.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.074
He'd been running practice hands for hours,

06:58.142 --> 06:59.976
and I was going to bed,

07:00.044 --> 07:02.779
and he said he had to run to the lobby
and meet one of the other players.

07:02.847 --> 07:04.714
That's it.

07:04.782 --> 07:07.384
I think you're right. I don't think
your husband would leave on his own.

07:07.451 --> 07:10.654
He loves us so much, me and the baby.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.856
Also, he loves this.

07:17.061 --> 07:21.731
All right. You four are some of
the best liars in the world, right?

07:21.799 --> 07:23.533
Well, you have to be, otherwise you
wouldn't be sitting at this table,

07:23.601 --> 07:24.634
would you?

07:24.702 --> 07:26.303
I've got to tell you up front,

07:26.370 --> 07:27.938
it's not gonna be a fair fight.

07:28.005 --> 07:29.806
I mean, you can dodge all
you like, but come down to it,

07:29.874 --> 07:30.840
I'm gonna win.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.709
Just ask Mason what it's like

07:32.777 --> 07:34.277
to tangle with me.

07:34.345 --> 07:37.180
It used to be a hell of a lot
more fun in the old days, Cal.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.115
In my experience, a young guy like this,

07:39.183 --> 07:40.750
about to win a couple of million bucks,

07:40.818 --> 07:45.121
either finding himself in God
or losing himself in a woman.

07:45.189 --> 07:46.189
Search the bunny ranch.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.892
The old-timer's got a point there.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.094
I'll be right back.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.200
Here. You are a winner, my friend.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.969
Nice work. It was double zero, right?

07:59.036 --> 08:02.405
Nah, I wasn't feeling that. I put
it on 14, my mother's birthday.

08:02.473 --> 08:04.507
I told you to put it all on double zero.

08:04.575 --> 08:06.776
So you'd rather lose with
your number than win with mine?

08:06.844 --> 08:09.079
Yeah. Something like that, yeah.

08:09.146 --> 08:10.847
Yeah, that makes no sense.

08:10.915 --> 08:12.182
Yeah?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.550
Go back, do it again.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.018
Go on, buzz off.

08:15.086 --> 08:16.353
Tch.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.355
Right. Uh...

08:18.422 --> 08:22.525
Well, let's, uh, start with you, Mason.

08:23.761 --> 08:25.161
What did you do to the kid?

08:25.229 --> 08:27.664
The kid's no threat to me.
Why would I do anything
to him?

08:27.732 --> 08:29.199
Well, an empty chair at the table

08:29.267 --> 08:30.533
earns you an extra 500 grand,

08:30.601 --> 08:32.402
plus a better shot at the the other half million.

08:32.470 --> 08:36.373
Everyone here wins or loses
millions every day. No big deal.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.775
Vas thinks he's unbeatable.

08:38.842 --> 08:40.977
I am. How many investors do you have, hmm?

08:41.044 --> 08:43.280
I don't need money from
other people to back me.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.382
That's why I'm the best.

08:45.449 --> 08:47.517
Yeah, even after 5 vodka tonics?

08:51.155 --> 08:53.156
All right, what does it say about you lot

08:53.224 --> 08:55.725
that an Illinois farm boy

08:55.793 --> 08:58.061
can come out here with no experience,

08:58.129 --> 09:00.864
no investors, no craft,

09:00.931 --> 09:03.500
and slaughter you?

09:10.441 --> 09:12.342
So I'm leaving work early,

09:12.410 --> 09:14.144
maybe get a pedicure on the way home.

09:14.211 --> 09:17.180
It's good we're not in Vegas.

09:17.248 --> 09:19.683
Oh, I can catch up on my reading.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.184
I have a date tonight.

09:21.252 --> 09:22.352
Oh.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.187
A third date.

09:24.255 --> 09:25.789
Come on.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.424
Sorry, Doug.

09:28.459 --> 09:30.026
With a girl?

09:30.094 --> 09:31.194
A human girl?

09:31.262 --> 09:32.295
Oh, ha ha.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.898
You're so... not funny.

09:40.304 --> 09:42.305
Foster's sent us a video file to score.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.141
Oh, one file shouldn't take too long.

09:48.079 --> 09:49.879
Oh, no.

09:51.515 --> 09:54.017
I hope your date's patient.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.825
You feeling a little guilty there, Poppy?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.727
Am I feeling guilty?

10:03.794 --> 10:05.628
Or sad?

10:05.696 --> 10:07.364
They're quite similar, aren't they?

10:07.431 --> 10:10.633
Jake is my friend. Shouldn't I
be feeling sad that he's missing?

10:10.701 --> 10:11.968
What happened to him?

10:12.036 --> 10:13.636
Do you miss Vegas?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.807
No.

10:18.876 --> 10:20.243
Well...

10:20.311 --> 10:21.745
Yeah... no, I lied.

10:21.812 --> 10:22.912
Yeah.

10:22.980 --> 10:25.115
Yeah, just a little bit.

10:25.182 --> 10:26.583
Don't tell anyone, right?

10:26.650 --> 10:28.451
You can trust me.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.490
Tell me the truth.

10:33.557 --> 10:35.325
Can't you see the truth?

10:35.393 --> 10:37.427
You can't, can you?

10:37.495 --> 10:39.162
You can't read me and you like that.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.297
You like my poker face, Dr. Lightman?

10:43.868 --> 10:45.235
Ok, the truth.

10:45.302 --> 10:48.037
Jake's had 3 months to imagine
playing at the final table

10:48.105 --> 10:50.206
and everything it means.
His whole life is gonna change.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.574
He just wanted to talk to somebody,

10:51.642 --> 10:54.577
somebody's who's gonna tell
him it's all gonna be ok.

10:54.645 --> 10:56.146
He trusted you.

10:56.213 --> 10:59.282
So I met him at a little place down the strip,

10:59.350 --> 11:02.085
made him feel better for half an hour, and left.

11:02.153 --> 11:04.087
How many times in the last 3 months

11:04.155 --> 11:05.722
did you manipulate his confidence

11:05.790 --> 11:08.158
in the guise of being his friend?

11:08.225 --> 11:10.393
I wouldn't manipulate Jake.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.661
Whoa.

11:11.729 --> 11:13.329
Excellent. That's righteous indignation.

11:13.397 --> 11:15.331
It's also total nonsense.

11:15.399 --> 11:17.233
I think you worked him.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.369
I think you'd do everything you could

11:19.437 --> 11:20.737
to convince him that winning

11:20.805 --> 11:22.238
was more of a curse than a blessing

11:22.306 --> 11:24.674
to get an advantage at the final table.

11:24.742 --> 11:28.278
I mean, it's brilliant, as far as strategies go.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.847
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

11:30.915 --> 11:33.583
Well, you had to. You needed
me to trust you, right,

11:33.651 --> 11:35.151
so you shared a half-truth.

11:35.219 --> 11:37.253
Cal.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.722
A call just came in to the production phone.

11:39.790 --> 11:42.459
Go ahead, bob. Play it back.

11:42.526 --> 11:44.761
we have Jake Hartman.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.096
We will return him for $2 million.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.832
This is a very small amount of money

11:48.899 --> 11:50.667
compared to what the casino earns.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.636
We'd advise that you not tell the police.

11:53.704 --> 11:55.705
We will call back in 3 hours.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.992
Mrs. Hartman, kidnapping
makes this a federal case,

11:58.060 --> 12:00.928
And I've got the las Vegas FBI
field office running at full speed.

12:00.996 --> 12:02.996
Why would anyone take my husband?

12:03.064 --> 12:05.165
Well, most likely it's someone who knows

12:05.233 --> 12:06.633
that Mr. Ellis is willing to pay

12:06.701 --> 12:08.068
to have Jake at the final table.

12:08.136 --> 12:11.071
Mr. Ellis is going to pay

12:11.139 --> 12:12.640
2 million dollars?

12:12.707 --> 12:14.742
The money is being bagged as we speak.

12:14.810 --> 12:17.077
And I'll be analyzing the ransom call.

12:17.145 --> 12:19.513
We're gonna figure out who did this.

12:19.581 --> 12:22.750
We're gonna do everything
we can to get your husband back.

12:22.818 --> 12:26.187
Where's Dr. Lightman?

12:29.724 --> 12:32.560
Why $2 million, eh?

12:32.627 --> 12:37.364
I mean, Ellis is willing
to pay it, but $2 million?

12:42.337 --> 12:43.838
Is that rage,

12:43.905 --> 12:46.373
Mr. Valdez?

12:47.742 --> 12:48.542
No.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.177
But you're upset, aren't you,

12:50.245 --> 12:52.780
that Ellis is willing to drop
2 million to get the kid back?

12:52.848 --> 12:54.281
Is that it?

12:54.349 --> 12:55.816
How long is this gonna take?

12:55.884 --> 12:58.686
Me and my boys, we have a club opening to get to.

12:58.753 --> 13:00.955
All this guy cares about is cash and parties.

13:01.022 --> 13:02.022
No respect for the game.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.224
That's not true.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.826
I also care about fame.

13:05.894 --> 13:08.395
And girls. And, of course, vodka.

13:12.901 --> 13:15.736
Go lose some money. Go on, buzz off.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.077
Hello, beautiful lady.

13:23.144 --> 13:25.946
It'll never happen, Vas.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.848
She's too good for you.

13:27.916 --> 13:29.617
The way she walks,
she's too good for anyone.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.085
That's not nice, Poppy.

13:31.152 --> 13:33.153
Nice isn't fun.

13:33.989 --> 13:34.955
Oh! Look at that.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.924
That's what we call a macro-expression.

13:36.992 --> 13:39.660
She may as well stick her tongue down his throat.

13:39.728 --> 13:41.929
No, she wants something from him.

13:41.997 --> 13:44.331
Well, maybe she's just attracted to him.

13:44.399 --> 13:46.567
You are such an innocent, Loker.

13:46.635 --> 13:48.836
Tell me, this girl that you're dating,

13:48.904 --> 13:50.204
where do you take her?

13:50.272 --> 13:52.172
Tonight, Luigi's.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.474
Last week, Meridiana,

13:53.542 --> 13:54.875
the week before that... 

13:54.943 --> 13:56.510
No, no, no, no. You're doing this all wrong.

13:56.578 --> 13:58.012
How do you not I know this?

13:58.079 --> 14:01.415
Ok, I know a lot... about dating.

14:01.483 --> 14:05.019
You think you are getting
lucky tonight, don't you?

14:05.086 --> 14:06.954
Well, you are not.

14:07.022 --> 14:10.291
100 bucks says she's dating you
for the 5-star food.

14:10.358 --> 14:12.226
Ok. If we're gonna bet,

14:12.294 --> 14:15.262
I want your office for one week.

14:15.330 --> 14:19.066
Well, in that case, I want your ant farm.

14:23.271 --> 14:24.672
It's a bet.

14:31.646 --> 14:32.913
I'm letting Amadeo go.

14:32.981 --> 14:34.982
No, no, don't do that.

14:35.050 --> 14:37.251
The ransom call is loaded
with syntactical anomalies.

14:37.319 --> 14:39.353
I'd expect more use of idiom for one thing,

14:39.421 --> 14:40.521
and it seems almost edited.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.423
I think the person we're looking for's

14:42.490 --> 14:43.924
first language isn't English.

14:43.992 --> 14:45.859
Well, I'm getting nothing from him.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.828
Well, what are you getting from her, other than lust?

14:47.896 --> 14:48.796
Excuse me?

14:48.863 --> 14:51.031
Well, she's still a suspect.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.733
She's the female equivalent of roulette.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.668
And you like the view.

14:54.736 --> 14:57.204
It's a very nice view.

14:57.272 --> 15:00.307
You're smothering me.

15:01.743 --> 15:05.579
Amadeo, wake up, wake up.

15:05.647 --> 15:07.448
You can go.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.351
Are you seriously keeping me here?

15:10.418 --> 15:13.554
Yes. I should consider that a compliment, Mason.

15:13.622 --> 15:14.555
Adios, amigos.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.556
Adios.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.157
Well, I'm happy to stay near Ms. Foster.

15:17.225 --> 15:19.259
Yeah, I'll bet you are.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.028
The kidnappers just called with the ransom drop.

15:21.096 --> 15:23.297
All right, let's go.

15:39.147 --> 15:43.617
That's our guy coming out
with the ransom money.

15:43.685 --> 15:44.985
All right, the bag is in place.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.320
Let me get a ready from everybody.

15:46.388 --> 15:47.354
Ready.

15:47.422 --> 15:48.489
Ready.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.124
All ready.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.925
All right, listen up. The kidnappers will know

15:51.993 --> 15:54.361
that there's surveillance
cameras covering this whole area.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.829
They'll have a strategy.

15:55.897 --> 15:58.432
Keep your eyes open. Stay focused.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.802
Oh, hey, before I forget...

16:01.870 --> 16:03.704
You're a big winner.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.372
Congratulations.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.175
Double zero, right?

16:08.243 --> 16:09.643
Yeah, double zero.

16:09.711 --> 16:11.612
Hey.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.381
What number did you bet on?

16:14.449 --> 16:15.849
23.

16:15.917 --> 16:17.785
Hey, it's Michael Jordan
and Lebron James' number.

16:17.852 --> 16:18.952
What do you want me to do?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.621
I told you double zero. Here.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.457
Listen, do you not get that I'm Mr. Lucky?

16:23.525 --> 16:25.059
Do you want to lose?

16:25.126 --> 16:26.627
You do not walk up to a roulette table

16:26.695 --> 16:28.062
and just bet it on double zero.

16:28.129 --> 16:29.530
You gotta feel it out.

16:29.597 --> 16:30.631
Nonsense.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.466
Yeah, well, this stack of money in my hand

16:32.534 --> 16:33.967
says otherwise. Hold up.

16:35.336 --> 16:37.471
What are Amadeo's boys doing here?

16:38.540 --> 16:39.640
Hailing a taxi?

16:39.708 --> 16:41.975
Oh, listen up. I did some digging.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.578
The day before Jake disappeared,
Amadeo switched rooms.

16:44.646 --> 16:46.447
His new room is right next to Jake's.

16:46.514 --> 16:49.583
Amadeo's not involved in this.

16:49.651 --> 16:52.986
Well, it looks like you just got played, doc.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.457
These have gotta be the dumbest kidnappers.

16:56.524 --> 16:58.058
Move in, move in.

17:00.962 --> 17:03.063
Get out of the cab! FBI!

17:03.131 --> 17:04.431
Put your hands on the roof.

17:04.499 --> 17:05.432
Turn around!

17:05.500 --> 17:07.534
Put your hands on the roof!

17:16.608 --> 17:17.809
Amadeo valdez!

17:17.876 --> 17:19.810
Open up!

17:19.877 --> 17:21.813
Open up!

17:25.217 --> 17:27.185
Put your hands up!

17:27.252 --> 17:29.454
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

17:29.521 --> 17:30.822
Put your damn hands up.

17:30.889 --> 17:31.889
What is this?

17:31.957 --> 17:33.191
You know what the hell this is.

17:33.258 --> 17:34.826
Cuff him!

17:37.596 --> 17:38.863
Why are you doing this?

18:00.853 --> 18:02.720
Lightman.

18:06.992 --> 18:08.326
What?

18:08.393 --> 18:10.594
He's meticulous.

18:14.666 --> 18:17.034
Footage of the other players.

18:17.102 --> 18:19.704
He's been studying them.

18:19.771 --> 18:21.739
Fixing onto us to pick up the ransom?

18:21.807 --> 18:24.608
You're not too swift.

18:34.786 --> 18:36.287
Who's in the next room?

18:36.355 --> 18:37.755
Jake. I told you that already.

18:37.823 --> 18:38.956
No, no, no.

18:39.024 --> 18:40.458
No.

18:40.525 --> 18:42.093
Not that one.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.661
That one.

18:43.729 --> 18:46.230
You know what my favorite poker phrase is?

18:46.298 --> 18:49.567
I don't know. All in? Open limp?

18:49.634 --> 18:51.635
The nuts?

18:51.703 --> 18:53.204
On tilt.

18:53.271 --> 18:55.740
It's so expressive.

18:55.807 --> 18:57.742
You want a pull. It's Amadeo's.

18:57.809 --> 18:59.076
I don't drink.

18:59.144 --> 19:00.878
Yeah, you do.

19:00.946 --> 19:02.580
Only an amateur lets frustration

19:02.647 --> 19:04.315
Interfere with his game theory.

19:04.383 --> 19:05.316
You think?

19:05.384 --> 19:07.785
Here.

19:07.853 --> 19:11.155
Have a drink.

19:11.223 --> 19:12.790
I insist.

19:17.696 --> 19:20.031
That's right. It's water.

19:20.098 --> 19:21.365
Oldest trick in the book.

19:21.433 --> 19:24.135
But Amadeo sold you, didn't he?

19:24.202 --> 19:25.903
He's a liar.

19:25.971 --> 19:27.405
Yeah.

19:27.472 --> 19:29.473
He's a fantastic liar, actually.

19:29.541 --> 19:30.908
When you thought he was partying next door,

19:30.976 --> 19:32.410
he was wearing noise-reduction headphones,

19:32.477 --> 19:34.712
mapping out a strategy for every possible hand.

19:34.780 --> 19:38.549
Amadeo knows every play at
that final table inside and out.

19:38.617 --> 19:41.385
But you're the one he considers a threat.

19:41.453 --> 19:42.987
Guess I'm flattered.

19:43.055 --> 19:45.423
Fake drinking, constant talk of partying.

19:45.490 --> 19:47.825
Changing his room to torture
you with hideous music.

19:47.893 --> 19:49.827
It's all calculated to drive you nuts.

19:49.895 --> 19:52.296
He wanted your tilt at the final table.

19:52.364 --> 19:54.131
But you tilted ahead of schedule, didn't you?

19:54.199 --> 19:57.535
So has Lightman broken down the old man yet?

19:57.602 --> 20:00.037
No, but he will.

20:00.105 --> 20:02.139
Well, maybe I can be
the hero of the day, then.

20:02.207 --> 20:06.077
This... was taken earlier this afternoon.

20:06.144 --> 20:08.245
Watch Mason's hands.

20:08.313 --> 20:11.649
Now you see the cell phone, now you don't.

20:17.789 --> 20:20.324
5 minutes later...

20:22.227 --> 20:25.062
and now you do again.

20:27.766 --> 20:28.766
Ta-da.

20:28.834 --> 20:30.935
We've got it all on video, Mason.

20:31.002 --> 20:32.503
You palmed Amadeo's cell phone

20:32.571 --> 20:35.005
and texted his boys to pick up the ransom bag.

20:37.342 --> 20:39.844
I'm not making it to the final table, am I?

20:39.911 --> 20:42.646
No. Afraid not.

20:42.714 --> 20:44.582
Come on, it was a prank.

20:44.649 --> 20:46.650
I messed with Amadeo, he messed with me.

20:46.718 --> 20:47.751
You faked a kidnapping

20:47.819 --> 20:50.454
to give yourself a leg up to win $8.5 million.

20:50.522 --> 20:52.123
That's not a prank.

20:52.190 --> 20:54.125
That's a crime.

20:55.494 --> 20:57.461
It wasn't about the money, though, was it?

20:57.529 --> 20:59.463
You didn't think that Amadeo

20:59.531 --> 21:00.965
deserved to sit at the final table with you.

21:01.032 --> 21:03.734
He's a punk. He doesn't take the game seriously.

21:05.804 --> 21:08.139
Well, that's what I thought, anyway.

21:08.206 --> 21:10.941
He played this old gambler but good, didn't he?

21:11.009 --> 21:12.743
Who did you get to make the ransom calls?

21:12.811 --> 21:14.311
Some drunken tourist.

21:14.379 --> 21:16.514
Gave him 1,000 bucks.
People will do anything

21:16.581 --> 21:18.315
for the almighty dollar in this town.

21:18.383 --> 21:19.850
I got a question for you.

21:19.918 --> 21:21.252
It's a yes-or-no question.

21:21.319 --> 21:25.523
Did you have anything to do
with Jake's disappearance?

21:25.590 --> 21:29.059
No. 40 years ago that boy was me.

21:29.127 --> 21:32.129
Hell, even I'm rooting for him.

21:32.197 --> 21:34.165
Let's go, Mason.

21:34.232 --> 21:36.233
Come on.

21:39.271 --> 21:41.839
Not to be smothering,

21:41.907 --> 21:43.174
But are you ok?

21:43.241 --> 21:44.241
Yeah.

21:44.309 --> 21:45.442
Why wouldn't I be?

21:45.510 --> 21:47.511
Well, you've known Mason a long time.

21:47.579 --> 21:50.948
No, I knew him a long time ago.

21:51.016 --> 21:54.618
That's a completely different thing.

21:54.686 --> 21:57.955
I mean, he took a gamble and he lost.

21:58.023 --> 22:00.191
His choice.

22:01.026 --> 22:03.961
Speaking of gambles...

22:06.631 --> 22:08.499
she's roulette.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.401
Stay away.

22:18.543 --> 22:20.311
You enjoying the show?

22:20.378 --> 22:21.912
Very much.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.881
Word is Ellis is having you followed

22:23.949 --> 22:27.484
because he doesn't want you
fleecing his big customers.

22:27.552 --> 22:29.753
You really that good at harpooning whales?

22:29.821 --> 22:32.323
I used to be.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.658
Hmm, we should play sometime.

22:34.726 --> 22:37.261
My guess is we already are.

22:38.563 --> 22:41.732
If your friend Foster as suspicious as you?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.334
More so.

22:43.401 --> 22:44.401
She doesn't like me.

22:44.469 --> 22:45.436
Not at all.

22:45.503 --> 22:47.338
She fears women like you

22:47.405 --> 22:49.840
bring out the worst in me.

22:50.909 --> 22:52.743
Promise?

23:02.520 --> 23:03.821
What is it?

23:03.888 --> 23:06.290
I'm not quite sure.

23:06.358 --> 23:08.392
Fancy a field trip?

23:08.460 --> 23:11.929
Is your bodyguard still out there?

23:13.698 --> 23:16.233
Hey, how you doing? You all right?

23:17.802 --> 23:20.170
Yep.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.941
All right.

23:38.223 --> 23:40.224
Rudy!

23:40.292 --> 23:42.159
Do you still keep your ladies

23:42.227 --> 23:44.328
down at the bar at the Nouveau Royale?

23:44.396 --> 23:46.764
You do? How many you got?

23:46.831 --> 23:48.332
I'll take 3.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.335
Yeah. You send them up to, um,

23:51.403 --> 23:52.603
the 28th floor.

23:52.671 --> 23:53.704
Yeah.

23:53.772 --> 23:55.239
There's a guy there. He's in a gray suit

23:55.307 --> 23:56.440
and he's a meathead.

23:56.508 --> 23:58.676
And just tell him that, um,

23:58.743 --> 24:00.611
he's getting married tomorrow.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.780
Yeah. How long?

24:02.847 --> 24:05.683
Yeah, 15 minutes. 15 minutes, yeah.

24:05.750 --> 24:06.884
That's good.

24:06.951 --> 24:08.852
All right. Yeah, we'll talk.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.454
All right, put it on my account.

24:14.159 --> 24:17.594
what are we gonna do for 15 minutes?

24:34.713 --> 24:36.814
You only take me to the best places.

24:36.881 --> 24:38.849
Yeah.

24:40.251 --> 24:41.985
The note with this address on it... 

24:42.053 --> 24:43.487
Do you think it came from Jake?

24:43.555 --> 24:44.988
I don't know.

24:45.056 --> 24:46.490
Do you?

24:46.558 --> 24:48.992
Can we ever just have a normal conversation?

24:49.060 --> 24:51.295
Point taken.

24:51.363 --> 24:55.099
Oh, God. What is that smell?

25:16.287 --> 25:18.722
Oh, my God.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.778
You got the note early this morning?

25:30.846 --> 25:31.779
Yep.

25:31.847 --> 25:33.080
Uh-huh. In your room?

25:33.148 --> 25:34.849
And then you got some prostitutes

25:34.916 --> 25:37.585
to cause a distraction so you
could sneak out of the hotel?

25:37.652 --> 25:39.553
Kind of ingenious, don't you think?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.856
Foster, why can't you take
it easy? We're in Vegas.

25:41.923 --> 25:44.892
I just think it's a bad idea to antagonize Ellis.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.794
Among other bad ideas.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.829
I was happy to help.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.365
She was.

25:52.934 --> 25:55.302
Dr. Foster, thank you for the call.

25:55.370 --> 25:56.337
Sure.

25:56.404 --> 25:58.038
How was it with the ladies? Was it good?

25:58.106 --> 25:59.874
Is it Jake?

26:01.743 --> 26:03.811
Abe.

26:08.383 --> 26:10.718
It's Abe Tostevin.

26:10.785 --> 26:13.087
He was one of the best poker coaches
in the country back in the day.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.722
He died. So what happened?

26:14.789 --> 26:17.391
Abe had a knack for pissing people off.

26:17.459 --> 26:20.661
A few years ago Vegas became untenable.

26:20.729 --> 26:23.964
He worked with most of the
greats until he nosedived.

26:24.032 --> 26:27.201
The question is, what's the
connection between Jake and Abe?

26:27.269 --> 26:28.536
Well, maybe he was coaching Jake.

26:28.603 --> 26:30.504
Abe wouldn't show his face
near the championship.

26:30.572 --> 26:31.906
Well, in addition to Jake Hartman

26:31.973 --> 26:34.775
being a missing person, he's
now also a murder suspect.

26:43.718 --> 26:45.186
You cared about him.

26:45.253 --> 26:48.489
He gave me the only advice I ever needed.

26:48.557 --> 26:51.058
T-o-t-t.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.560
Tatas on the table.

26:52.627 --> 26:55.563
Won me a lot of pots.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.535
Ok, now, look at the contraction

27:01.603 --> 27:03.737
of the orbicularis oculi pars lateralis.

27:03.805 --> 27:07.308
With the smile, there,

27:07.375 --> 27:09.977
that's classic action unit 6.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.645
She's so into me.

27:15.450 --> 27:18.052
But, looking for someone better to talk to.

27:18.119 --> 27:19.353
That's bad.

27:20.188 --> 27:21.255
All right. Come here.

27:21.323 --> 27:24.892
I'll show you something that'll blow your mind.

27:28.129 --> 27:30.731
Oops!

27:30.799 --> 27:32.132
The lip lick.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.301
The universal signal

27:34.369 --> 27:35.569
for "I want you."

27:35.637 --> 27:37.504
Case closed. I win.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.407
Loker, I'm gonna let you in
on one of the true rules

27:40.475 --> 27:41.542
of womanhood.

27:41.610 --> 27:42.643
Cool.

27:42.711 --> 27:44.578
If a guy's boring you,

27:44.646 --> 27:46.814
like you want to stick a fork in your eye boring,

27:46.881 --> 27:49.216
a good lip lick can rattle him enough

27:49.284 --> 27:51.986
to change the conversation topic.

27:52.053 --> 27:53.854
No.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.193
I was going on about the herd mentality

27:59.261 --> 28:01.462
in the Kenyan elk population.

28:02.631 --> 28:05.332
I'm not getting your office for a week, am I?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.967
Nope.

28:07.035 --> 28:10.738
Ingrid's not dating me, she is
dating my restaurant choices.

28:10.805 --> 28:12.339
Yep.

28:12.407 --> 28:14.375
Oh, well.

28:21.082 --> 28:23.651
Treat them well.

28:33.395 --> 28:34.895
Abe Tostevin is dead.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.498
I thought that this was about Jake.

28:37.565 --> 28:39.033
Yeah, it is.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.068
How'd you feel about Abe being back in town?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.169
I felt nothing.

28:42.237 --> 28:43.437
I didn't know.

28:43.505 --> 28:45.372
I met him once
in Monte Carlo.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.840
You mean drunk?

28:46.908 --> 28:48.442
You ever see Abe
and Jake together?

28:48.510 --> 28:49.610
No.

28:49.678 --> 28:50.978
But I saw Abe 2 days ago.

28:51.046 --> 28:52.513
We had lunch together.

28:52.580 --> 28:53.914
Well, you could have told me about that earlier.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.449
You didn't ask before.

28:55.517 --> 28:57.384
Anything else you're keeping from me?

28:57.452 --> 28:59.620
Your partner makes me light in the head.

29:02.891 --> 29:06.160
Well, I have to begin my pregame ritual, so...

29:06.227 --> 29:11.298
Why don't you come and have
blueberry pancakes with me?

29:11.366 --> 29:13.734
You're not going anywhere. Sit down.

29:13.802 --> 29:16.337
That's a bit naughty, isn't it?

29:16.404 --> 29:20.674
Hitting on Foster here while your
girlfriend's sitting right there.

29:20.742 --> 29:24.678
You two are, uh, you're, you
know, sleeping together, are you?

29:24.746 --> 29:28.315
Occasionally, but it doesn't mean anything.

29:28.383 --> 29:29.416
She sleeps with everyone.

29:29.484 --> 29:31.385
This gets better and better.

29:31.453 --> 29:32.820
This is not a sideshow, bob.

29:32.887 --> 29:34.888
Move on.

29:34.956 --> 29:36.490
Oh, I get it.

29:36.558 --> 29:38.058
I get it. You guys... 

29:38.126 --> 29:40.227
you are the best liars in the world.

29:40.295 --> 29:41.328
Congratulations. Terrific.

29:41.396 --> 29:42.830
I'm bowled over.

29:42.897 --> 29:46.233
Someone tell me something.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.969
Vas and I, we have a 10 grand prop bet

29:49.037 --> 29:52.072
on whether he can get your partner into bed.

29:52.140 --> 29:54.475
Which is now off.

30:05.787 --> 30:07.354
Arrest Poppy.

30:07.422 --> 30:09.256
For what?

30:09.324 --> 30:10.457
Murder.

30:10.525 --> 30:12.760
You're joking.
He's joking.

30:12.827 --> 30:14.862
Can I talk to you?

30:14.929 --> 30:16.697
She's a murderer.
Arrest her.

30:16.765 --> 30:19.133
You sure this isn't one of
your double zero bets?

30:19.200 --> 30:20.934
Reynolds.

30:21.870 --> 30:24.938
All right, come on, stand up.

30:25.006 --> 30:27.174
Put your hands behind your back.

30:27.242 --> 30:31.612
You're under arrest
for the murder of Abe Tostevin.

30:39.203 --> 30:40.672
You know, you probably want
to call a lawyer about this.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.174
Of course, you wont be able
to make bail till Monday.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.375
After the final table.

30:44.443 --> 30:47.011
Cal, I know you're mad at me, but don't do this.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.413
Mad? What, should I be mad?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.614
I know I'd be mad.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.882
Are you gonna stop this?

30:50.950 --> 30:53.217
You started it. You're gonna have to stop it.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.322
Fine.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.790
Fine.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.926
Jake wanted Macey to know he was ok,

31:01.994 --> 31:03.595
but he didn't think it was safe to call her,

31:03.662 --> 31:04.596
so he called my cell.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.898
Truth at last. When?

31:06.966 --> 31:09.300
An hour before we got together.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.969
So I stopped a guy in the casino,

31:11.036 --> 31:13.638
told him to take that note to the front desk.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.139
To be delivered in the morning

31:15.207 --> 31:17.642
when you planned to be with
me, above suspicion, right?

31:17.710 --> 31:20.912
I was gonna tell you all about it
after the championship was over.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.080
How thoughtful.

31:22.147 --> 31:25.516
Why is Jake hiding? What's he so afraid of?

31:25.584 --> 31:26.818
No idea.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.219
You seemed genuinely surprised

31:28.287 --> 31:29.754
when you saw Abe's body.

31:29.822 --> 31:31.489
Jake just said he saw something awful.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.726
That's it. I didn't know it was Abe.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.861
If Jake called from wherever he's holed up,

31:36.929 --> 31:39.364
a trace will lead us right to him.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.000
You let Jake's wife carry on thinking

31:42.067 --> 31:43.835
he was, what, dead or worse.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.938
You really are a hawk with
a bunny rabbit, aren't you?

31:47.006 --> 31:49.440
The golden boy missing from the final table... 

31:49.508 --> 31:52.276
that's worth at least an extra $400,000.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.013
I studied the numbers and made my decision,

31:55.080 --> 31:56.681
same as always.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.927
Jake? It's me, baby. Let me in.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.964
What are you doing?

32:13.032 --> 32:16.067
It's all right now.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.043
Hey.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.944
All right?

32:28.180 --> 32:30.515
I just wanted it to be over.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.184
Which part, the fame or the fortune?

32:33.252 --> 32:35.653
As soon as I made the final
table, my life changed.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.121
Yeah, knowing you were about to win

32:37.189 --> 32:39.857
at least $1.5 million, that really sucks.

32:39.925 --> 32:42.660
I didn't know who to trust.
Everyone's different.

32:42.728 --> 32:47.165
Is that you talking or is that Poppy?

32:47.232 --> 32:50.034
I just want our old life back.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.502
I don't even know this Abe guy.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.104
Yeah, but you knew where to find his body.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.639
I stumbled across it.

32:54.707 --> 32:58.476
Also you stumbled across the trunk of his car?

33:00.846 --> 33:04.582
You know we found the murderer, right?

33:04.650 --> 33:05.783
You did?

33:05.851 --> 33:08.019
Yeah.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.455
No, I lied.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.357
When I lie, sometimes I do this.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.861
You... when you lie,

33:16.929 --> 33:18.896
you do this.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.467
I think Poppy got close enough
to you to figure that out.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.703
The others, I don't know, maybe.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.940
That little move, the right cards in your hand,

33:29.007 --> 33:30.641
you could make, what?

33:30.709 --> 33:32.543
8 and a half million?

33:32.611 --> 33:35.947
That's why Abe was here.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.216
To coach you, help you win.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.220
Look, I don't care what you think you know.

33:42.287 --> 33:44.489
I'm not risking my family's safety.

33:44.556 --> 33:47.625
And I don't know anybody named Abe.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.094
Stay tuned for more of the
poker world championship...

33:50.162 --> 33:51.095
All right, cut.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.397
Excuse me.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.432
Do it again.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.067
If you wanted me in handcuffs,

33:56.135 --> 33:57.602
you could have just asked.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.271
We found Jake.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.673
He was hiding out.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.108
He saw Abe's murder.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.011
He just got scared.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.446
So, who did it?

34:08.514 --> 34:09.480
What do you care?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.549
It's nothing to you, right?

34:11.617 --> 34:14.585
It turns out Jake doesn't know who did it.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.255
He just freaked out. He...

34:17.322 --> 34:20.591
His wife wants him to play
the final table, though.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.060
But I don't think he'll budge.

34:23.128 --> 34:24.762
I'd say too bad, but... 

34:24.830 --> 34:25.830
Poppy, you're up.

34:34.039 --> 34:37.641
Stay tuned for more of
the poker world championship.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.915
What if she doesn't
take the bait?

34:43.982 --> 34:44.982
She will.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.516
Maybe there's time for Ben

34:46.585 --> 34:47.784
to run to the casino while we wait.

34:47.853 --> 34:51.088
So, the betting you two have been doing,

34:51.156 --> 34:53.658
you up or down?

34:53.725 --> 34:56.027
You think I didn't know?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.296
Gillian, your really gotta
learn to embrace this town.

34:58.363 --> 35:01.899
It was just a couple of bets for old times' sake.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.101
Mm-hmm.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.772
Vas.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.043
It was you, wasn't it?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.046
What are you talking about?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.681
We had a deal.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.583
You and me, first and second place

35:18.650 --> 35:20.785
at the final table.

35:20.853 --> 35:23.120
The deal stands.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.689
Not if you killed Abe.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.258
I told you he didn't know about us.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.460
The bastard could read you like a book.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.129
Why do you think he
asked you to lunch, huh?

35:32.197 --> 35:33.464
Old times' sake?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.132
He cared about me.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.035
He was coaching another player.
He wanted information.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.403
Are you really that stupid?

35:39.471 --> 35:40.771
Are you?

35:43.208 --> 35:44.508
You just kill a man

35:44.576 --> 35:46.344
because you think maybe
he knows something?

35:46.411 --> 35:49.647
Yeah. Going to cost me $15 million.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.649
You really did it?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.851
You killed him?

35:53.919 --> 35:56.087
Not me. One of my investors from Moscow.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.990
I'm calling the police.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.559
We're good.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.929
Cal.

36:05.898 --> 36:07.231
She's in trouble.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.064
Uhh!

36:16.300 --> 36:17.734
Hold it right there, Vas!

36:20.638 --> 36:22.705
Stop!

36:22.773 --> 36:25.041
You hold it right there!

36:42.426 --> 36:44.360
Have you had enough?

36:44.428 --> 36:46.162
Have you had enough?

36:51.936 --> 36:54.337
Stay still.

36:58.209 --> 37:00.843
So how did you know she'd go there?

37:00.911 --> 37:02.779
It was in her own best interest.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.948
Some people don't change.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.950
So you knew she had
information the whole time

37:07.017 --> 37:08.685
and you still slept with her?

37:08.752 --> 37:10.286
That's not why I slept with her.

37:10.354 --> 37:11.688
You all right?

37:15.092 --> 37:16.226
We're live in 2 hours.

37:16.293 --> 37:18.127
Perfection, people.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.729
Oi!

37:19.797 --> 37:22.432
Ellis.

37:22.499 --> 37:24.267
I want double.

37:24.335 --> 37:26.970
My bonus for bringing Jake back
to the final table... double it.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.705
He says he's not showing up.

37:28.772 --> 37:29.973
Oh, he'll show up.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.442
Abe was killed by the Russian

37:32.509 --> 37:35.144
and his mafia investors.

37:35.212 --> 37:36.846
Why?

37:36.914 --> 37:39.249
'Cause he was coaching Jake.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.054
You already knew that, didn't you?

37:45.122 --> 37:48.591
That's why you brought him back to town.

37:48.659 --> 37:50.260
I paid for his ticket out.

37:50.327 --> 37:52.695
Yeah. Yeah. And you paid for mine, too.

37:52.763 --> 37:55.331
Yet here I am, 'cause you need me.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.200
Well, I didn't need Abe.

37:57.268 --> 37:58.768
What, you didn't want him to coach Jake,

37:58.836 --> 38:00.603
just give him that little extra edge?

38:00.671 --> 38:02.272
I don't get involved on that level.

38:02.339 --> 38:04.607
Because the integrity of the championship

38:04.675 --> 38:05.608
is paramount.

38:05.676 --> 38:07.176
Yes, it is.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.945
Oh. Right.

38:09.013 --> 38:10.947
Golden boy from Evergreen Park, Illinois,

38:11.015 --> 38:12.615
wins the tournament.

38:12.683 --> 38:14.784
Next year, every hayseed in America

38:14.852 --> 38:17.186
is going to be plopping down
20 grand to enter.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.689
I didn't bring Abe back to Vegas.

38:19.757 --> 38:22.292
See, you hired me as a lie expert,

38:22.359 --> 38:24.294
and then you lied to me.

38:24.361 --> 38:26.195
Double it.

38:33.070 --> 38:35.538
Medium triple latte.

38:35.606 --> 38:36.773
Thanks.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.107
How long you been watching that?

38:38.175 --> 38:40.043
Mm.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.178
Not long.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.015
I lied.

38:46.917 --> 38:48.051
She likes you.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.285
Nice try.

38:49.353 --> 38:51.421
But I saw the lip lick.

38:51.488 --> 38:54.223
The, uh, true rule of womanhood.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.958
Yeah, uh...

38:56.026 --> 38:59.195
Loker, there's no such thing
as true rule of womanhood.

38:59.263 --> 39:00.496
I made it up.

39:00.564 --> 39:03.266
You were doing that really super-annoying

39:03.334 --> 39:05.268
smug guy thing.

39:05.336 --> 39:06.769
I was pissed.

39:06.837 --> 39:08.538
And I wanted the ant farm.

39:08.605 --> 39:09.839
I am smug?

39:09.907 --> 39:13.843
Well, how do I know you're telling the truth now?

39:19.183 --> 39:20.817
Not only is she laughing,

39:20.884 --> 39:22.618
she's looking right into your eyes.

39:22.686 --> 39:24.987
She's being polite.

39:27.057 --> 39:29.592
This isn't being polite.

39:31.595 --> 39:34.464
Her pupils were dilated.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.937
Well, she did... touch my knee

39:41.004 --> 39:42.839
at one point.

39:46.977 --> 39:50.780
So you think I should... call her and... 

39:50.848 --> 39:52.081
Definitely.

40:04.061 --> 40:05.528
Crazy things happen in the desert,

40:05.596 --> 40:07.430
and we've seen our fair share,

40:07.498 --> 40:09.232
with our final table already cut down

40:09.299 --> 40:11.901
from 5 players to just 3.

40:11.969 --> 40:15.171
Let's get started and introduce them to you.

40:15.239 --> 40:16.472
It's not easy being leader,

40:16.540 --> 40:18.741
and that's true of our current chip leader,

40:18.809 --> 40:21.244
the lone amateur at this final table.

40:21.311 --> 40:24.013
The golden boy from Evergreen Park, Illinois.

40:24.081 --> 40:26.382
Where's that, you ask?
No one knows.

40:26.450 --> 40:29.519
This kid came out of
nowhere to sweep through
the early rounds...

40:29.586 --> 40:30.586
Hey, Ben.

40:30.654 --> 40:32.121
Hey.

40:32.956 --> 40:34.824
Hey, wow. You... 

40:34.892 --> 40:37.093
Huh. Wow.

40:37.161 --> 40:38.094
You look great.

40:38.162 --> 40:39.862
Yeah, you, too. I mean...

40:39.930 --> 40:41.798
The dress, the shoes, the whole thing.

40:41.865 --> 40:43.199
Lovely.

40:43.267 --> 40:45.268
I thought I should embrace the Vegas.

40:46.336 --> 40:48.204
Ladies and gentlemen, Jake Hartman!

41:02.886 --> 41:03.820
No.

41:03.887 --> 41:05.421
No, no, no, no, no.

41:05.489 --> 41:07.824
I'm not letting you spend your last night here,

41:07.891 --> 41:11.227
looking like that, watching
other people play poker.

41:11.295 --> 41:13.129
I'm not interested in gambling.

41:13.197 --> 41:15.631
Do you really think that that's
all this town has to offer?

41:15.699 --> 41:18.468
Just wait and see. I'm gonna blow your mind.

41:25.642 --> 41:28.478
I'm gonna go get the car
and I'll met you out front.

41:28.545 --> 41:30.179
First-class service for you all the way.

41:30.247 --> 41:31.848
Just for you.

41:31.915 --> 41:32.982
And now,

41:33.050 --> 41:36.185
the 23rd poker world championship...

41:36.253 --> 41:37.520
Shuffle up and deal!

41:48.432 --> 41:49.799
How you doin', Gordie?

41:49.867 --> 41:51.234
Living the life, Dr. Lightman.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.536
I'm told you got a one-night pass to the casino.

41:53.604 --> 41:57.373
One million dollars compliments of Mr. Ellis.

42:19.730 --> 42:22.198
All of it on double zero.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.535
Hi, Foster.

42:25.602 --> 42:28.905
Could you imagine putting
that much money on one number?!
