00:01.835 --> 00:04.938
Here we are.
(grunts)

00:05.005 --> 00:06.573
I keep all of my correspondences

00:06.640 --> 00:10.143
from the past seven and a half
centuries in this box.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.979
<i>I used to get so many letters.</i>

00:13.046 --> 00:14.314
Who's it gonna be?

00:14.380 --> 00:16.016
<i>From my mom and dad</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:19.586
when I was away training with
the Al Quolanudarian forces.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.154
"Dear Nandor,

00:21.221 --> 00:24.758
we hope that the rocks there
are not too hard."

00:24.825 --> 00:28.795
At training camp,
we would use rocks as pillows.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.597
And blankets.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.500
<i>This one is a letter</i>
<i>from the leader of an army</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.436
that we defeated
with particular brutality.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.438
<i>Tens of thousands</i>
<i>were slaughtered.</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:41.074
<i>I guess I never had</i>
<i>a chance to open it.</i>

00:41.141 --> 00:43.777
"I resign myself to surrender.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.080
I plead for a road to peace."

00:47.914 --> 00:49.149
Oops.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.384
Oh, this one is good.

00:51.451 --> 00:54.354
An anonymous friend
sent me a token

00:54.420 --> 00:58.191
for a free scoop
at Baskin and Robbins.

00:58.258 --> 01:02.763
I can't eat ice cream,
but it meant a lot.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.598
<i>I have asked Guillermo</i>

01:04.665 --> 01:06.800
<i>to bring me</i>
<i>his computing machine</i>

01:06.867 --> 01:09.803
so I can see if I have received
any electronic letters

01:09.870 --> 01:12.205
‐in the past decade.
‐GUILLERMO: Okay.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.240
‐All right.
‐Ah, yes.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.042
GUILLERMO:
Connect this...

01:16.109 --> 01:18.478
All right, there you go.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.519
It's connected
to this Ethernet cable.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.954
Yes, I know how
the ether works, Guillermo.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.991
‐No, Ethernet.
‐Give me this.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.626
(error chime)

01:33.660 --> 01:36.329
(error chime continues)

01:36.396 --> 01:38.999
Okay. Well, if that's it,

01:39.065 --> 01:41.234
I'm gonna head out, 'cause I
have a couple of errands to run.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.570
‐Okay, then, bye‐bye.
‐Bye‐bye.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.372
Oh, uh, I got some blood
on my fancy collar,

01:46.439 --> 01:48.074
so if could you get me
one of those...

01:48.141 --> 01:49.409
‐Tide to go pens?
‐...soapy pens

01:49.475 --> 01:51.177
‐you can use on clothing.
‐Tide to go pens.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.478
The Tide pen.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.981
‐The "to go" variety.
‐To go.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.718
There's money in the dish
on the table in my room.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.852
The money dish.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.453
Uh, it's gone black.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.723
No, no, it's just asleep.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.693
Arise. Arise!

02:06.760 --> 02:10.731
What is "arise," again?

What if it's a little

02:47.501 --> 02:49.570
‐KIDS: Kill.
‐What if it's a little

02:49.636 --> 02:51.572
‐KIDS: Kill.
‐Oh, look here.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.474
Guillermo, you ready
to slay some Suckers?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.644
Uh... I brought
some wooden stakes

02:57.711 --> 02:59.580
‐that I had at home
so we can practice...
‐TONYA: Nice.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.979
‐...slaying some Suckers.
‐CLAUDE: Right on.

03:03.045 --> 03:04.680
<i>GUILLERMO:</i>
<i>I've decided</i>

03:04.746 --> 03:06.548
(whispers):
to infiltrate the group

03:06.615 --> 03:09.885
and sabotage
whatever plans they have.

03:09.952 --> 03:11.921
'Cause I would never forgive
myself if something happened

03:11.988 --> 03:14.156
to Nandor, Nadja or Laszlo.

03:14.223 --> 03:16.325
But I don't think I have to be
worried too much with this...

03:16.392 --> 03:18.660
CLAUDE:
Stab it, stab it like this!
Gotta kill it.

03:18.727 --> 03:20.562
Glad you brought
your camera crew, too.

03:20.629 --> 03:22.064
Helps get the word out.

03:22.131 --> 03:24.400
For too long,
these vampires have gotten away

03:24.466 --> 03:27.403
with treating humans
like either dinner or dirt.

03:27.469 --> 03:29.371
You know, every relationship
has its ebbs and flows.

03:29.438 --> 03:30.940
Ooh! I'm feeling good.

03:31.007 --> 03:32.341
‐DEREK: Yeah. Yes.
‐You feeling good?

03:32.408 --> 03:34.876
‐I feel good.
‐Hell yeah.
‐Yeah.

03:34.944 --> 03:36.645
You guys are pumped
for training.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.347
CLAUDE:
Training? Nah. Training's over.

03:38.414 --> 03:42.318
‐What‐what's going on?
‐Our first official hunt.

03:44.086 --> 03:45.121
I'm sorry, what?

03:48.257 --> 03:52.194
Oh, uh‐‐ No, I thought
we were just going to,

03:52.261 --> 03:54.130
‐uh, practice today...
‐No, no, no.

03:54.196 --> 03:56.798
We finally have a real target.
Shanice, fill him in.

03:56.865 --> 03:58.767
You know my roommate
who was turned into a vampire?

03:58.834 --> 04:00.002
Well, I think I figured out

04:00.069 --> 04:01.337
where the ones
who turned her live.

04:01.403 --> 04:04.840
It's a house right here
in Staten Island.

04:04.907 --> 04:06.175
It's a very
spooky‐looking place.

04:06.242 --> 04:09.411
No one goes in or out
during the day.

04:09.478 --> 04:10.679
No cars are parked out front.

04:10.746 --> 04:13.715
And there a lot of bats.

04:13.782 --> 04:15.884
Plus, there are
these very strange

04:15.952 --> 04:19.688
tr‐‐ tr‐‐tenopinaries.
Tipperaries?

04:19.755 --> 04:22.058
‐Chilip‐‐ Tilopirar...
‐Topiary.

04:22.124 --> 04:23.825
These hedges
out in the front yard.

04:23.893 --> 04:27.029
Do, uh, any of these hedges
look like...

04:28.230 --> 04:29.665
...vaginas?

04:29.731 --> 04:31.033
(stifled laugh)
My man.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.234
SHANICE:
I mean, I guess

04:32.301 --> 04:34.370
some of them
are of the adult nature.

04:34.436 --> 04:36.973
I think I know what house
you're talking about.

04:37.039 --> 04:39.108
They're normal human beings.
They're not vampires.

04:39.175 --> 04:40.876
They're, like, teachers
or social workers, actually.

04:40.943 --> 04:43.579
‐We are going there tonight.
‐Yes!

04:43.645 --> 04:46.148
No! We shouldn't go tonight.

04:46.215 --> 04:48.484
This is my second meeting.
I thought we were gonna just‐‐

04:48.550 --> 04:50.052
ha‐‐ practice.

04:50.119 --> 04:51.420
I could go another round
at that crossbow.

04:51.487 --> 04:52.854
And I know that Derek
mentioned something.

04:52.922 --> 04:54.256
You could go
another round, right?

04:54.323 --> 04:55.824
‐No, I'm good.
‐I'm pretty sure you said it.

04:55.892 --> 04:56.993
No, we've never
talked outside of this.

04:57.059 --> 04:58.127
Okay, well, he doesn't remember.

04:58.194 --> 05:01.397
‐Gear up. Let's ride.
‐Yes.

05:01.463 --> 05:03.565
TONYA:
All right, guys.
We have enough for, like,

05:03.632 --> 05:05.334
two holy waters per person.

05:05.401 --> 05:06.936
(hyperventilating)

05:07.003 --> 05:09.805
Breathing exercises.
I like it, Guillermo.

05:11.073 --> 05:13.809
I'm going to check my Hotmail.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.411
Password?

05:15.477 --> 05:18.214
Uh... What is my password?

05:18.280 --> 05:21.417
A secure, alphanumeric one,
I hope.

05:21.483 --> 05:24.921
People think that just varying
the case and adding a number

05:24.987 --> 05:28.357
is enough to keep
would‐be hackers at bay,

05:28.424 --> 05:29.391
but the truth is,

05:29.458 --> 05:31.393
that's just the floor,
not the ceiling.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.796
I have a very secure password,
okay, Colin Robinson?

05:34.863 --> 05:36.966
My password
is an impenetrable fortress.

05:37.033 --> 05:41.503
That's it.
"Impenetrable fortress."

05:41.570 --> 05:43.805
I have two e‐mail messages.

05:43.872 --> 05:47.143
"Fandango.com presents

05:55.051 --> 05:56.318
‐I...
‐Too late.

05:56.385 --> 05:58.854
‐I missed it.
‐(laughs): Sandy Bullock.

05:58.921 --> 06:01.290

delightful in it.

06:01.357 --> 06:04.193
She dazzled.

06:59.539 --> 07:01.774
‐Why did you let me
read this far?
‐Well...

07:01.841 --> 07:05.378
Says here some girl called
Arianna disobeyed Bloody Mary,

07:05.445 --> 07:06.947
and now she's dead.

07:07.014 --> 07:08.648
They ripped her guts out

07:08.715 --> 07:11.584
‐and dropped them on the front
doorstep of her parents.
‐Oh!

07:11.651 --> 07:12.719
I'd say we're fucked.

07:12.785 --> 07:14.421
This light box has cursed us.

07:14.487 --> 07:16.023
Do you think it could maybe
be something

07:16.089 --> 07:17.157
from the neighborhood imp,

07:17.224 --> 07:18.625
having a cheeky little joke?

07:18.691 --> 07:20.060
This is not a joke.

07:20.127 --> 07:21.995
It says it in many places.

07:22.062 --> 07:24.297
Here, here, and here.

07:24.364 --> 07:27.600
Don't look, my sweet darling.
It's too dangerous.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.002
<i>Curses are very common</i>

07:29.069 --> 07:31.438
‐and very serious.
‐Yes, this is true.

07:31.504 --> 07:33.240
When I was younger,
I saw so many

07:33.306 --> 07:35.042
horrible curses going around.

07:35.108 --> 07:37.377
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>who was just in the market,</i>

07:37.444 --> 07:40.280
<i>and he didn't pay the fair</i>
<i>price for the meat of a goat,</i>

07:40.347 --> 07:43.550
then, poof, you know,
his bollocks are shriveled into

07:43.616 --> 07:45.252
two tiny little raisins.

07:45.318 --> 07:47.020
The man's bollocks.
Not the goat's.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.222
Oh, yeah. No, sorry.
I thought that was clear.

07:49.289 --> 07:52.092
‐No, it wasn't.
‐(chuckles)
‐(scream echoing)

07:52.159 --> 07:53.460
‐Curses really hit you
where it hurts.
‐Mm‐hmm.

07:53.526 --> 07:57.264
Well, I definitely,
uh, succeeded

07:57.330 --> 07:58.698
with the infiltrating part
of the plan,

07:58.765 --> 08:01.201
but I'm having a little trouble
with the sabotage

08:01.268 --> 08:03.170
in that we're about to drive
a van full of vampire‐killing

08:03.236 --> 08:04.604
weapons to the house.

08:04.671 --> 08:07.040
I just need to pretend I'm one
of them. Just, just pretend...

08:07.107 --> 08:08.808
Guillermo!
We gotta move.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.112
Derek's mom needs the van back
first thing tomorrow morning.

08:12.179 --> 08:14.447
‐Let's ride.
‐Yeah.

08:14.514 --> 08:17.817
Why did you even open
this thin machine?!

08:17.885 --> 08:19.519
I was just checking
my e‐mails.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.922
I didn't know it would be
full of curses.

08:21.989 --> 08:23.490
All right, calm down.

08:23.556 --> 08:27.327
All we need to do is
send that to ten friends or foes

08:27.394 --> 08:29.562
by sunrise, and the curse
will be lifted.

08:29.629 --> 08:31.899
Where are we going to get
the e‐mail addresses,

08:31.965 --> 08:33.666
the "e‐mail address shop"?!

08:33.733 --> 08:35.535
No, I'm guessing that'll be
closed this time of night.

08:35.602 --> 08:39.272
I do have the e‐mail address
for a Count Fandango.

08:39.339 --> 08:41.108
Well done, Nandor.
Send it to him.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.743
One step forward
to unforeseen fortunes.

08:43.810 --> 08:46.046
One step away from getting
our guts ripped out.

08:46.113 --> 08:47.014
What do you say?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.348
‐(hisses)
‐How dare you do that?

08:48.415 --> 08:50.383
You want to end up
like Arianna?

08:50.450 --> 08:52.052
‐Fine.
‐Hold your bleedin' horses.

08:52.119 --> 08:55.222
Some chap's left
his calling card.

08:55.288 --> 08:58.258
A "Timothy,"
at Circuit City stores.

08:58.325 --> 09:00.193
"Happy to help," he says.

09:00.260 --> 09:02.795
It also has his phone number...

09:02.862 --> 09:05.298
‐and e‐mail address.
‐(Nadja cackles)

09:05.365 --> 09:07.367
‐(Nandor laughs)
‐Looks like Timothy's
going to be getting

09:07.434 --> 09:10.037
‐a curse in the electronic post.
‐NANDOR: Yeah!

09:10.103 --> 09:11.905
(all laughing)

09:11.972 --> 09:13.974

We still have to get
the van back to Derek's mom.

18:24.785 --> 18:26.152
CLAUDE:
Yep.

18:26.219 --> 18:28.855

18:36.462 --> 18:37.831
That is ten e‐mails. (laughs)

18:37.898 --> 18:39.365
LASZLO:
So what do we do,
wait till sunrise?

18:39.432 --> 18:41.234
How do we know
that Sir Bob Geldolph

18:41.301 --> 18:43.236
‐has that e‐mail?
‐Uh...

18:43.303 --> 18:45.138

‐Oh...

18:45.205 --> 18:47.273
Whoa, it's all right.

NADJA:
Oh, no!

18:49.710 --> 18:51.444
Don't fear, my darling.

18:51.512 --> 18:53.980
Laszlo, your forearm is
not curse‐proof!

18:54.047 --> 18:55.549
Please!

18:55.616 --> 18:57.984
All this is playing
havoc with my guts.

18:58.051 --> 18:59.986
Talking about guts,
I did tell you about Arianna

19:00.053 --> 19:02.656
‐when her guts were dragged out
on the doorstep?
‐Yes, yes!

19:02.723 --> 19:04.424
No, no, no, please!

19:04.491 --> 19:07.093
Bloody Mary, have mercy on us!

19:07.160 --> 19:09.830
Do not rip our guts out!

19:09.896 --> 19:11.565
Guillermo?

19:11.632 --> 19:13.834
You scared the shit out of us!

19:13.900 --> 19:16.670
What was that dilly‐dallying
at the door?

19:16.737 --> 19:19.139
Could you just come in
like a normal person?

19:19.205 --> 19:20.607
The door's getting stuck again.

19:20.674 --> 19:22.776
I like tie‐dye‐‐
have you been to a concert?

19:22.843 --> 19:24.310
Yeah. Mm‐hmm.

19:24.377 --> 19:27.147
The Tide to go pens were
on sale, so you got some

19:27.213 --> 19:28.114
extra cash.

19:28.181 --> 19:30.416
Unforeseen riches.

19:30.484 --> 19:32.052
NADJA:
Oh, the curse!

19:32.118 --> 19:33.920
‐It has lifted!

19:33.987 --> 19:36.322

19:38.058 --> 19:41.828
(stammers) You don't even know
what this is about.

19:41.895 --> 19:44.064
Laszlo, now, really?

19:44.130 --> 19:46.733
LASZLO:
Oh, yes.

You know, while you were

we were in very serious danger.

19:57.177 --> 19:59.012
Because of your machine.

We could have been

I know it's a little silly,
