NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.294 --> 00:06.464
-FAY: Frank, I want you to meet--
-Hal Massey. Pleasure.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.216
(clears throat)
Unless I'm terribly mistaken,

00:08.299 --> 00:09.926
Frank Jr. already has a father figure.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.346
Believe me nothing is going to change
between you and Little Frank.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.472
His name is Frank Jr.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.850
Excuse me, Francis,
if I could interrupt for one moment.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.893
Your lunch for Hal Massey today.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.438
HAL: And I just want to say one thing
to all of you.

00:21.521 --> 00:25.316
Oh, boy, I'm not feeling very well.

00:26.901 --> 00:27.736
FAY: Hal?

00:30.572 --> 00:31.781
FAY: Oh, Hal!

00:31.865 --> 00:36.369
For someone whose entire life has just
come crashing in on her, she's okay.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.038
(sobbing)

00:44.044 --> 00:46.629
NARRATOR:<i> And now tonight</i>
<i>on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:46.713 --> 00:49.507
Fay, have you thought
about taking some time off?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.926
Who knows? You might get lucky
and meet another Italian.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.430
Stop this criminal act,
or I shall be forced to use violence.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.431
Name.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.643
(vocalizes fanfare)
Captain Freedom. (imitates explosion)

01:00.727 --> 01:02.937
It got claustrophobic in here
last night, Frank.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.231
Two dead, another one critical.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.025
Two more jacked out of shape real good.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.820
I get the distinct impression
you're implying gang business here.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.447
I don't care if they're rebels

01:12.530 --> 01:15.366
or charter members
or your own damn brothers. I want 'em.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.413
(chattering)

01:20.497 --> 01:23.583
(clears throat) Item 24.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.169
-(all groaning)
-MAN: Aw, come on.

01:27.003 --> 01:31.132
-Item 24.
-(laughing)

01:31.216 --> 01:32.842
(indistinct)

01:32.926 --> 01:34.677
PHIL:
As many of you have no doubt observed,

01:34.761 --> 01:37.222
our new holding facilities
on the garden level

01:37.806 --> 01:39.849
are now ready to accommodate guests.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.977
(chattering)

01:43.061 --> 01:46.731
Be reminded, these luxuriously-equipped
new holding cells

01:46.981 --> 01:50.151
are emphatically not an invitation to,
uh, hanky-panky

01:50.235 --> 01:52.737
with any lady visitors looking
for a premature plea bargain.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.907
-Let's you and I try.
-(laughing)

01:55.990 --> 01:57.242
PHIL: Moving right along here,

01:57.325 --> 02:01.246
item 25 is a communiqué
from Detective Belker,

02:01.329 --> 02:05.792
who continues to stake out the, uh,
gas station on 122nd and Central

02:05.875 --> 02:08.461
in hopes of apprehending
the malicious malcontent

02:09.170 --> 02:11.756
sticking up said class of establishments.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.219
Uh, Detective Belker requests that, uh,

02:16.636 --> 02:18.221
"All you...

02:19.430 --> 02:21.224
units driving--"

02:21.307 --> 02:24.561
-"Eunuchs."
-(all laughing)

02:25.770 --> 02:26.938
PHIL: Excuse me.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.442
"All you eunuchs driving too close
to my stakeout

02:31.818 --> 02:36.406
during business hours
had better stop compromising me

02:36.781 --> 02:39.242
or I'll take it out
on the internal organs..."

02:39.325 --> 02:41.828
-What's a eunuch?
-"...of each and every one of you."

02:41.911 --> 02:43.788
(all muttering)

02:47.041 --> 02:49.878
"Stay clear. This means you."

02:49.961 --> 02:51.379
(chattering)

02:51.462 --> 02:54.883
-Item 26.
-(all groaning)

02:54.966 --> 02:57.427
Relax, fellas.
We're going for the record today.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.347
Item 26 concerns the daring deeds
of our caped crusader,

03:01.431 --> 03:04.601
the one in ballet tights
and green swim trunks.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.855
Said individual made
two appearances yesterday.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.274
One at Delaware Park
in pursuit of a purse snatcher,

03:11.357 --> 03:14.360
the other,
rendering gasoline-type assistance

03:14.444 --> 03:16.237
to a motorist stranded on the freeway.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.157
-We oughta hire him.
-(all laughing)

03:19.240 --> 03:21.117
You are encouraged to take time away

03:21.201 --> 03:24.370
from the rat-infested,
poverty-stricken urban reality

03:24.454 --> 03:26.414
and tiptoe through the enchanted forest

03:26.497 --> 03:28.333
-and throw a net over this guy...
-(jackhammer clanging)

03:28.416 --> 03:31.044
-(all laughing)
-...before he hurts himself.

03:31.127 --> 03:34.589
-(drill whirring)
-Item 27.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.008
(all groaning)

03:37.091 --> 03:39.344
PHIL: As regards noise pollution.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.180
-MAN: You can say that again.
-PHIL: Guys, what can I tell ya?

03:42.263 --> 03:45.099
They're supposed to be out
of here by tomorrow sometime.

03:45.725 --> 03:50.355
Frankly, I'm not entirely lucid
as to what they're doing,

03:51.356 --> 03:55.443
but boiler repair
is a seasonal fact of life.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.362
-(clanging continues)
-I would like to conclude...

03:57.445 --> 04:00.031
-(whistles)
-(all cheering)

04:04.911 --> 04:07.580
...with a special warning

04:07.664 --> 04:10.416
to those among us
of the Gemini persuasion.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.795
Your fashion horoscope
from this morning's paper.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.340
"Tweeds and shetlands
may bring new romance,

04:17.840 --> 04:20.009
but cowboy boots are a kick in the pants."

04:20.093 --> 04:24.013
-(all laughing)
-"For career goals true,

04:24.097 --> 04:26.975
-don't wear blue."
-WOMAN: Thanks for the tip.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.519
-(all chattering)
-WOMAN: Let's get out of here.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.273
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.650
PHIL: And hey. Hey!

04:37.068 --> 04:38.695
Let's be careful out there.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.781
(all chattering)

04:42.198 --> 04:44.492
You think he was sayin' something
about my cowboy boots?

04:44.575 --> 04:46.786
(chattering)

04:46.869 --> 04:50.748
He is saying that your cowboy boots
are totally without any class whatsoever.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.294
Well, aside from their obvious virtues,
stature-wise,

04:54.377 --> 04:55.795
they also happen to make me feel good.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
Personally, I don't know how in the world

04:57.714 --> 05:01.759
you can fit a whole foot plus five toes
into that pointy little space.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.178
Well, you'll notice that that pointy
little space,

05:04.262 --> 05:06.139
when applied
with a certain deftness of aim,

05:06.222 --> 05:09.142
provides a measure of incentive
to your more reluctant-type felons.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.477
-(grunts)
-Hey, look!

05:11.561 --> 05:14.480
-Would you look at this?
-Oh, no. Look at this.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.150
I bought this for Christmas
for you last year.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.527
I went down to Main Street
and had your name put on it. "Bobby Hill."

05:19.610 --> 05:23.865
And now look what ha-- (laughs)

05:23.948 --> 05:25.283
Bo... Bobby, listen.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.701
-Since you're having a hard time...
-What are you laughing at?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.536
...getting started this morning,
why don't you let me take the driving?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.496
Are you crazy? You're the worst driver
in the whole state.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.750
I am not-- I am not the worst driver
in the whole state!

05:33.833 --> 05:36.210
All day-shift units. All day-shift units.

05:36.294 --> 05:40.173
We have a double homicide
at 2379 Jefferson.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.842
Hernandez, McAdoo, Coffey, Bates,
Hill, Renko. Let's go.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.012
Gotta like a job that peaks
your adrenaline before breakfast.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.391
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:51.684
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:51.768 --> 05:55.396
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:55.480 --> 05:57.231
(sirens wailing)

06:02.695 --> 06:04.155
(theme music playing)

07:48.759 --> 07:51.679
-How bad is it?
-It speaks for itself.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.307
(camera shutter clicks)

07:56.350 --> 07:57.602
(man coughs)

07:58.060 --> 07:59.812
(chattering)

08:04.484 --> 08:06.777
MAN: Recheck that office to see
what else we can find.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.904
Yes, sir.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.743
-We're almost done, Frank.
-Two dead?

08:13.826 --> 08:17.079
Another one critical.
Two more jacked out of shape real good.

08:17.163 --> 08:17.997
(shutter clicks)

08:18.080 --> 08:20.124
It got claustrophobic in here
last night, Frank.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.169
Closing time, uh, they just walked in.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.631
In the bar, the bartender, waitress,
an unidentified couple

08:27.173 --> 08:29.383
and a wino who found a dollar bill
out on the street.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.512
There were three of them,
wearing ski masks.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.516
They locked the doors and made everyone
lay face flat on the floor.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
-There's a piece of scalp behind the bar.
-Wallets, watches, rings.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.437
-Can somebody bag it?
-Emptied the register.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.315
Tore the place apart.
Anything that could be broken.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.276
They, uh, drank beer,
urinated on the floor,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.487
and they, uh, started on the people.

08:49.737 --> 08:53.032
They pistol-whipped the bartender and,
uh, broke both his hands.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.451
Must have given them
some trouble or something.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.662
Then they put the guns
to the women's heads,

08:58.246 --> 09:01.624
and they repeatedly
raped and sodomized them.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.210
And they took one in the john.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.212
It isn't pretty in there.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.507
-Captain.
-Hill.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.218
Henry, there's a trail of stuff
for six blocks.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.471
Beer lamps,
ashtrays thrown through store windows.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.974
-What they couldn't carry they dropped.
-Any help there?

09:18.057 --> 09:20.393
-It goes nowhere.
-Right. I'll tell the inspecting officer.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.435
Thanks.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.438
The worst was the psychological torture.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.858
The victims were told over and over
they were gonna be killed,

09:27.942 --> 09:30.444
were made to beg for their lives.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.446
Went on for about three hours.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.033
When it wasn't fun anymore,
they just stood 'em up and shot at 'em.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.703
Uh, we dug lead out
of three walls over there.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.038
This one here

09:42.123 --> 09:43.749
critically wounded the bartender.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.877
And, uh,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.589
this one here killed the Jane Doe.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.757
It was fun. They enjoyed it.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.719
-It was target practice.
-(woman sobbing)

09:58.306 --> 10:01.267
Get her to County Medical,
and if it's at all possible,

10:01.350 --> 10:02.727
then up to the precinct.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.856
-Alice.
-(gasps)

10:06.939 --> 10:08.858
It's all right. It's all right.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.373
-Why?
-Kicks.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.085
They picked the bar at random.
It was a good a place as any.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.630
-But it was a gang.
-The survivors said that?

10:31.297 --> 10:35.009
There's a lot of confusion, Frank,
but the assailants were wearing colors.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.719
We just don't know whose.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.679
There are other indications.
PCP cigarettes.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.264
They called each other by street names.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.768
The whole thing has that twisted
kind of organization to it.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.275
-Phil, Ray, in my office.
-(chattering)

10:51.359 --> 10:54.278
We wrap this in 24 hours,
or we lose it, Phil.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.238
-How bad was it?
-Worse than you can imagine.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.156
Massacre.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.661
If they're at all able,

11:01.744 --> 11:03.954
I want the survivors in here
this afternoon, looking at pictures.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.748
Ray, we're gonna call
a gang leader summit.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.041
Mau-Mau, Diablo, Blood.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.002
I mean everybody. I want 'em in roll call
by 3:00 this afternoon.

11:10.086 --> 11:14.298
Diplomacy-wise, Francis, a summit
on short notice may cause problems.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.176
You know something, Phil?
I don't give a damn about diplomacy.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.596
I want 'em in here where I can see
their sweat. If they resist, make arrests.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.682
Don't worry about probable cause.
We'll figure that out later.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.017
If you have to, take Belker
off the gas station, then turn him loose.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.062
-Nobody does this in my precinct.
-Ricardo Ruiz,<i> por favor.</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:30.439
What happened, Henry?
Who was on the streets last night?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.192
-Teniente Calletano, Hill Street.
-I just don't know, Frank.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
What do you mean you just don't know?
It's your job to know.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.613
You were there, Henry.
It was wholesale slaughter.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.324
Complete and total barbarism
worse than open warfare.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.452
If you don't start knowing soon, Henry,
it's gonna happen again.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.247
Look, Frank.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.667
The gang intervention guys are in a
seminar with Chief Daniels right now.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.502
They'll get here just as soon as they can.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.839
Oh, that's just great. Seminars now.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.718
I can think of at least ten questions
that oughta be answered this instant.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.886
Who, if anybody,
is connected with that bar?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.722
Who's been hanging around this block?

12:02.805 --> 12:05.307
-Where is he?
-Is there a dispute with this bar?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.394
Is protection involved?
Is protection being paid?

12:08.477 --> 12:12.440
Names of gangs suffering dissidents.
The names of those dissidents.

12:12.523 --> 12:17.278
Names of members booted out of gangs in
the last six months and the reasons why.

12:17.361 --> 12:21.031
Names of new gangs being formed
or in the process of being formed.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.242
Names of gang members connected

12:23.325 --> 12:25.453
with any other business establishment
in the neighborhood.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.579
Give us a couple of hours, Frank.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.955
-Come on!
-Names of gang members paroled

12:28.038 --> 12:30.291
from Hillcrest
in the last couple of months.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.960
Names of gang members connected
with any permanent,

12:33.043 --> 12:35.171
or even casual patrons of this bar.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.506
It's an emergency. Tell him to call
Lieutenant Ray Calletano...

12:37.590 --> 12:41.427
-Right.
-Hill Street, 555-7670, immediately.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.803
Captain, we're set to go.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.556
Refresh my memory, J.D.

12:45.639 --> 12:49.393
The arson job on that building
on Hudson that boiled that wino.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.687
We've got Murray the Torch downstairs.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.107
Got him two blocks from the scene
with his hands smelling like high-test.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.818
And you've conveniently
lost his file for the day.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.736
You got it.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.363
I'm gonna get a line on
whoever paid him to set the place.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.867
-Who else is down there?
-Uh, child molesting suspect.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.369
All right. We don't want to blow this
on a Miranda.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.748
It's leads we're after,
not grand confessions.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.375
I'm the soul of discretion.
I'll ask the guy if he's got a match.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.169
(shutter clicks)

13:18.547 --> 13:20.591
-Uh...
-You don't have a pass.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.177
-Um, well, I have--
-Neither have you. Do you mind? May I?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
-Hey, you can't take his camera.
-Phil, you wanna take the film

13:24.720 --> 13:25.554
out of there?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.224
Admission to the squad room
is by identification card only.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.683
If you please,
everybody out in the waiting room.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.185
Everybody. Everybody out now!

13:31.268 --> 13:33.938
-If you give us a chance--
-Can I get my camera back?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.899
-Squad room's yours, Phil. Do your job.
-Yes, Captain.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.279
-Can I have my camera?
-There's your camera.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.533
Now, get a pass at the front desk.
Go on, young man. Go on.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.700
(door slams)

13:51.622 --> 13:56.252
-(R&amp;B music playing on radio)
-All right. There you go.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.463
Mr. Al-Habib.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.299
-Pleasant motoring.
-(bell dings)

14:06.303 --> 14:08.639
(horn honking)

14:08.722 --> 14:11.559
(tires squeal)

14:11.642 --> 14:13.602
(honking continues)

14:17.273 --> 14:19.441
-What the hell are you doing?
-The horn's stuck.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.527
-We'll be finished in a minute.
-Get out of here!

14:21.610 --> 14:23.696
-What?
-I'm on stakeout!

14:23.779 --> 14:25.197
-Huh?
-You clowns were at roll call.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.784
-You heard what Esterhaus said.
-It is not as if we did this on purpose.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.578
It happened about a block
and a half away from here.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.996
Damn! Look at this, Renko.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.748
Oh, no. Look at that.
Now, that goes to show you

14:34.832 --> 14:37.835
what happens when you wear
a nice new jacket in crowd control.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.670
You're lucky you weren't
wearing that at the time.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.629
The horn!

14:40.713 --> 14:42.923
-First it was the jelly on my shirt.
-Would you get the horn?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.466
-Uh-huh.
-And then that cut-rate

14:44.550 --> 14:45.968
coffee cup unloads all over me.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.596
That's right. And then that drunk
throws up on your gun belt.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.097
Get out of my way, dog breath!

14:50.180 --> 14:51.599
You can't even get a jacket like that.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.100
-(shouts)
-(horn stops)

14:53.183 --> 14:55.477
-Hey. What did you just do?
-I just bought this jacket.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.314
You just broke that car. How am I gonna
explain that to Esterhaus?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.190
How'd you like to explain a missing lung?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.860
I paid 250 bucks for this jacket.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.905
So have it sewn. I don't care what you do.
Just get out of here.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.909
Have it sewn? You don't have any idea
what that would look like, do ya?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.535
-It would leave a big scar.
-That's right.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.121
And then the jacket
wouldn't even hang right.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.873
-That's right.
-I don't know you hair bags.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.124
Don't you understand that?

15:17.207 --> 15:19.835
I am not Mick Belker. I'm a gas jockey.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.922
You don't even know what fashion is,
the way you dress.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.798
Look at that. Come on, Renko.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.885
-(growls)
-Hey, Mick.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.304
You think as long
as we're in the neighborhood

15:30.387 --> 15:32.431
you might top us off
with a little supreme?

15:32.514 --> 15:34.516
(growling)

15:40.230 --> 15:42.691
-(door closes)
-(engine starts)

16:00.709 --> 16:02.962
Don't give me
that self-righteous tap dance.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.173
It's not a First Amendment issue.
I'm telling you something.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.132
-(speaking in Spanish)
-Next time those people come in

16:07.216 --> 16:10.135
without a permit, I'm gonna have 'em
arrested for interfering with an officer.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.762
CALLETANO: Mau-Maus and Pagans too.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.431
FURILLO: Well, it's just too bad
if they don't like my attitude.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.601
-It's the only one I have right now.
-Sure! Wise guy.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.229
Have I come at a bad time?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.940
Would you give us
a couple of minutes, Ray?

16:23.607 --> 16:24.608
Sure, Frank.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.655
-Our prayers are with you, Mrs. Furillo.
-Oh, thank you, Ray.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.574
Hey. Is that a bleeding mole
on your forehead?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.076
(Calletano chuckles) What bleeding mole?

16:34.159 --> 16:36.829
You know, it's one of the seven danger
signs of cancer.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.671
How are you, Fay?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.340
Frank, that missing piece
of plaster up there

16:48.424 --> 16:50.968
could be exposing you
to asbestos poisoning.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.763
You know, the tiny particles,
they filter down and get into your lungs.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.058
That kind has the 50 percent
mortality rate.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.518
Fay, what's going on?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.563
-Why? Nothing.
-(siren wailing in distance)

17:03.939 --> 17:07.359
Some people came over to the house
last night from Hal's campaign.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.196
They asked me if I wanted to run
for the school board in Hal's place.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.451
You know. They pointed out that since
I was young and fairly well-educated,

17:15.534 --> 17:19.246
they thought maybe I would appeal
to the same voter profile spectrum as Hal.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.624
-I said no, of course.
-Why "of course"?

17:22.916 --> 17:25.169
Frank, did you see
the newspaper this morning?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.130
Oh, that bomb explosion in London.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.425
I... I don't know. I just don't know what
kind of a world this is.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.552
And that tragedy in Upper Volta.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.680
You know, the school bus that just drove
right off the bridge.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.433
Fay, have you thought
about taking some time off?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.685
A trip to the islands
might be very good for you.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.228
I'll make a deal with you.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.856
I'll pick up the tab in exchange
for Frank Jr. for the week.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.068
Who knows? You might get lucky
and meet another Italian.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.529
-(chuckles)
-Sure. I can see it all now.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.032
You know, he'd make a pass
on the first day,

17:55.115 --> 17:58.035
he'd propose on the second,
and he'd drown on the third.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.953
Oh. (chuckles)

18:00.037 --> 18:04.291
That was a terrible thing to say,
wasn't it? (laughing)

18:05.667 --> 18:07.002
Oh, Frank. (sobbing)

18:10.464 --> 18:11.965
(door opens)

18:15.052 --> 18:17.179
Luncheon is served, gentlemen.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.973
-Hey. You got my smokes?
-Back off, you. Over there.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.935
-Hey. Come on. I gave you five bucks.
-What five bucks?

18:23.018 --> 18:23.852
-What do you mean?
-Rape some kid,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.979
and you cry about it afterwards.
Right, freak?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.441
-I'd cry too, I was him.
-Shut your face.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.485
Ever see what happens
to a child molester in the joint?

18:31.568 --> 18:33.278
I told you to zip it up!

18:34.404 --> 18:35.531
-(drill whirring)
-LARUE: Uh-huh.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.283
I got a lawyer named Schwartz.
You know what I mean? Schwartz.

18:38.367 --> 18:43.038
-Eats guys like you for breakfast.
-I got people lookin' out for me, sucker.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.458
(scoffs) You believe that jive? (chuckles)

18:47.793 --> 18:51.547
Man, the way they treat you in this joint.
Got no morality to it at all.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.715
Give it a rest, man.
You ain't shut up since you got here.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.219
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
It's my third beef, and it's bum.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.096
-Can you dig it?
-I said shut up!

19:00.889 --> 19:03.725
Hey, kid. I was in Rahway in '67.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.436
-Had a freak like you in our cell block.
-Cheese. I hate cheese.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.813
-Got bologna? Want to trade?
-By the end of the second night

19:07.896 --> 19:09.273
he was everybody's woman.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.817
He liked it. You gonna like it too, freak?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.445
Hey. Leave the kid alone. How about it?

19:15.529 --> 19:17.072
Man, I'd even confess to this stinkin' rap

19:17.156 --> 19:18.365
just so I could be there when you get it.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.702
And I might even help 'em give it to ya.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.582
Let me see that, Leo.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.125
No. This.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.004
Ah. "Sugar, mononitrate,

19:32.087 --> 19:36.216
beef fat, dextrose,
sodium acid, pyrophosphate,

19:36.300 --> 19:40.888
monocalcium phosphate,
mono- and diglycerides, sodium caseinate,

19:40.971 --> 19:45.392
polysorbate 60, artificial colorings
and flavorings and sorbic acid"?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.519
You're a walking time bomb, Leo.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.647
GOLDBLUME: Ever held on
transpersonal adolescent mod structuring.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.649
Furillo wants your butts up here
in an hour. We want some answers.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.152
Don't be ashamed of anything.
Alice, come on.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.821
It wasn't you. You gotta believe that.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.449
Chief Daniels can stick his seminars!

20:00.824 --> 20:03.327
The chief will be very pleased
to hear that, Henry.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.538
You think it'll get back to him?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.499
Excuse me, guys. Thanks.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.336
Right here.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.755
Alice,

20:15.339 --> 20:18.759
some of the women officers
have started a rape victim support group,

20:18.842 --> 20:19.968
and I want you to go.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.679
In fact, we'll go together.
Wednesday night.

20:24.014 --> 20:28.393
But for right now, if you can handle it,
I need you to look through some photos.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.064
-Sure.
-Okay.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.068
Joe, wanna give me a couple books?

20:41.323 --> 20:44.868
-(Alice sobbing)
-Progress on the summit?

20:44.952 --> 20:47.079
Seven chieftains, five warlords.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.290
Well, we got one or two recalcitrant types

20:50.374 --> 20:52.876
who are presently
being encouraged to attend.

20:53.919 --> 20:54.920
Thanks.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.883
Bev, Lucy may be able to use a backup.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.886
Tell her she can have
the interrogation room or my office.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.638
-I'll stay clear.
-Okay.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.890
(pop music playing on radio)

21:09.226 --> 21:11.270
(chattering)

21:15.941 --> 21:18.235
-(horn honks)
-He don't know what the hell he's doin'.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.698
Will you just relax? How many smarts
can it take to fix one lousy car horn?

21:22.781 --> 21:25.284
Will you cut that thing off!
Will you cut that!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.868
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-Turn it off!

21:27.327 --> 21:28.954
-(stops)
-Now, you listen to me, Cookie.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.665
I don't want you to consider
this an invite of some kind.

21:31.748 --> 21:35.168
I want you to consider this some sort
of a street subpoena.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.253
You know what I'm talkin' about?

21:36.336 --> 21:39.172
Hey, look, man.
You got papers on me, let's roll.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.633
Otherwise, I got better things
to be doin' with my time

21:41.717 --> 21:45.137
than standin' here playing group grope
with a bunch of city employees.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.596
Shake it, Monroe.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.891
Say, hold on, Cookie.
Before you run off mad, little brother,

21:49.975 --> 21:52.894
how about a little game of,
uh, liar's poker?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.271
-What?
-"What?"

21:54.354 --> 21:57.357
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles) What I'm sayin' is

21:57.774 --> 22:01.236
this bill against the serial numbers
on that hot box.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.904
Hey. Whoa, man. That's bogus.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.158
This is a legitimate purchase
from my uncle, Rudy.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.200
-Rudy?
-Yeah.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.245
So I guess you wouldn't mind
if we took them numbers downtown

22:10.329 --> 22:12.831
and ran them through our little computer,
would you now?

22:13.582 --> 22:16.501
All right, man.
What time's the powwow, chief?

22:16.835 --> 22:18.670
Oh, I'd say in about 40 minutes,

22:18.754 --> 22:23.467
and if you can't steal a bike by then, I
suggest you take the "D" bus, Uncle Rudy.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.012
I said shake it, Monroe!

22:27.763 --> 22:28.805
Later.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.432
Let's go.

22:35.562 --> 22:39.733
(chuckles) Had to rewire the entire
circuit. Uh, that'll cost ya five bills.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.693
-You got five bucks?
-Aw.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.236
<i>Bueno trabajo</i>, little buddy. Look.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.616
Just don't you spend all this money
on mind-altering substances. You got me?

22:52.037 --> 22:52.954
(sighs)

22:54.915 --> 22:55.957
Ah!

22:56.041 --> 22:57.876
<i>-Perfectamundo.</i>
-(honks)

22:57.959 --> 23:00.712
Now, if I would've listened to you,
we'd be down that station house garage--

23:00.796 --> 23:02.589
-Come on. Let's go.
-(siren wailing)

23:02.672 --> 23:04.174
-(horn honking)
-What is this?

23:04.257 --> 23:05.300
-What?
-I can't hear.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.010
What is this? Look at this.

23:07.094 --> 23:10.138
You make a call to the station house
right now, and you tell them

23:10.222 --> 23:12.641
that I want to have some emergency road
service right now.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.975
-If the radio works.
-What?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.238
(bell dings)

23:30.200 --> 23:33.120
-What'll it be?
-Uh, fill her up. Premium.

23:33.620 --> 23:37.374
Hey, look. Hey, hey, hey. Whoa. I, uh--
I need some tires. You got a chart?

23:37.457 --> 23:38.542
Yeah. Inside.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.505
-Tire chart, huh?
-Yeah. Right.

23:43.797 --> 23:44.631
Comin' up.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.260
There you go. Tire chart.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.062
You do it, dog breath,
and your brains will go across the street!

23:59.563 --> 24:01.231
Drop the piece. Easy!

24:05.610 --> 24:07.821
Don't look at me.
Don't look out there either.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.781
Read the chart. Read it!

24:17.247 --> 24:19.875
(phone dialing)

24:23.211 --> 24:26.298
Stop this criminal act,
or I shall be forced to use violence.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.425
Oh.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.178
Don't worry. Bullets can't hurt me.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.891
-Ah!
-(both groaning)

24:39.186 --> 24:43.190
-Get off.
-(tires squealing)

24:44.357 --> 24:46.401
(horn honking)

24:49.362 --> 24:50.739
(growls)

24:52.991 --> 24:54.826
You hair bag!

24:55.744 --> 24:58.163
You are under arrest!

25:04.419 --> 25:07.797
-(chattering)
-(man whistles)

25:10.634 --> 25:12.010
Belker.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.889
-MAN: Hill Street.
-WOMAN: He's arrested the man-fly.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.099
MAN: Check out the queen
in the red tights.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.268
MAN 2: Whoo, ooh!

25:24.898 --> 25:26.566
Sit, loony tune.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.905
I don't know why you're doing this.
The police are my allies.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.700
-We fight crime hand in hand.
-Move it, you lunch bucket.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.705
-Name.
-(vocalizes fanfare)

25:40.789 --> 25:43.124
Captain Freedom. (imitates explosion)

25:43.208 --> 25:47.045
Ten tons of nitro in one fist
and a neutron bomb in the other.

25:47.128 --> 25:51.383
When I walk, buildings shake
and bad guys wet their pants.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.844
You want to hear my manifesto?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.479
-Name.
-(vocalizes fanfare)

26:04.563 --> 26:06.940
Captain Freedom. (imitates explosion)

26:07.023 --> 26:09.150
I vow to give crime two black eyes

26:09.234 --> 26:12.195
and fight injustice and corruption
wherever they may lurk.

26:12.612 --> 26:16.449
And brotherhood. I... I want to establish
universal brotherhood.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.496
-Sit.
-(phone rings)

26:22.247 --> 26:23.290
What?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.543
Hi, Ma.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.462
No. Everything's fine.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.633
Oh, boy. I can't tonight, Ma.
I gotta work late.

26:35.343 --> 26:39.180
I know I promised. Can't we watch
television together tomorrow night?

26:40.765 --> 26:42.559
That's silly, Ma.
Of course I care about ya.

26:42.642 --> 26:45.729
I wouldn't do this if it wasn't
in the interest of public safety.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.899
I gotta call you back, Ma.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.695
Well, I love you the same amount.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.698
Really. Really.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.992
Really.

26:59.868 --> 27:00.869
Bye, Ma.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.248
-(sighs)
-Go see your mother tonight.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.541
Shut up.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.337
It ain't polite to listen
to other people's personal calls.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.214
Go ahead. Put her out of your mind,
like you do every day.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.218
She's just an old lady who makes
a nuisance out of herself, right?

27:17.844 --> 27:19.471
Just because she was the one person

27:19.554 --> 27:21.890
who made the world safe for you
when you were a kid

27:21.973 --> 27:26.353
doesn't mean you have to spend
a couple of hours making her happy.

27:26.519 --> 27:30.231
So what if she gave you
the best food off her plate,

27:30.774 --> 27:32.734
bought you goldfish from the five-and-ten.

27:32.817 --> 27:37.405
So what if she was there
for every Little League game.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.617
She wasn't beautiful or glamorous.

27:40.700 --> 27:44.621
She didn't live in a big house,
drive a fancy car.

27:44.704 --> 27:49.042
She was just a woman who loved her son.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.251
Yeah.

27:52.379 --> 27:57.050
My mother lives on the moon
in a jade bottle about this big.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.181
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:07.060 --> 28:12.190
Hey. It's my understanding Captain Furillo
was in some kind of a jam here.

28:12.273 --> 28:16.861
-Needs a little community expertise.
-Martinez, Los Diablos.

28:17.278 --> 28:20.990
Uh, the invitation
was for gang leaders only.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.701
Yo. This is my backup.

28:22.992 --> 28:26.913
You don't expect me to come to this police
"benefits" without a date, do ya?

28:27.414 --> 28:28.998
-Funny.
-Thank you.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.334
-(banging)
-Wait a minute, man. What are you doin'?

28:31.418 --> 28:34.087
I have rights down here!
You can't be just bringin' me in--

28:34.879 --> 28:37.590
I got Mr. Dudley R. Hicks here,
special delivery.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.843
Dudley. Nice name, Dudley.

28:39.926 --> 28:43.012
-Hey. Come on.
-You sure he's housebroken?

28:43.096 --> 28:44.514
-All right.
-Come on.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.932
Just settle down, son.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.644
Take the cuffs off, Luce.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.312
He just took a swing at Joe out there.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.564
No, take the cuffs off him.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.108
What happens on the street
we leave on the street.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.112
As long as he's here,
he's under the captain's safe-conduct.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.700
PHIL: The meeting is about
to commence, gentlemen.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.619
Downstairs, if you please.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.247
Yo. (speaking in Spanish)

29:09.664 --> 29:10.707
Hey, Dudley.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.126
Age before beauty.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.554
-(mouths word)
-Come on. Come on.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.727
Yeah. Well,
how would you like to be downwind of that?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.145
Martinez.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.651
-Place of residence.
-The city is my home.

29:38.735 --> 29:42.155
I fly the rooftops and move
through the alleys like a shadow.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.823
-I swim--
-Stop it.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.993
It's not true. None of it's true.
You make it all up.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.459
They're laughing at you.

29:54.876 --> 29:58.713
-(chattering)
-They are. They're making fun of you.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.799
Don't you understand that?

30:04.093 --> 30:07.180
What am I supposed to do? Hide in my room?

30:08.306 --> 30:10.266
Lock my doors and windows?

30:10.850 --> 30:14.562
Let the fear in the streets rule me
like it does millions of others?

30:15.730 --> 30:20.527
If every man and woman got up off
their knees and took a stand,

30:20.944 --> 30:24.280
you... you think that criminals would walk
the streets with impunity?

30:25.073 --> 30:31.371
No. This is my city,
my country, and I'm gonna fight for it.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.750
Life... Life is a gift.

30:36.125 --> 30:39.212
And you gotta reach out
and grab hold of it,

30:39.295 --> 30:41.339
or you are just part of the problem.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.385
You gotta... You gotta hug
your kids every day,

30:45.468 --> 30:48.263
and you gotta put gum wrappers
in your pocket

30:48.346 --> 30:52.225
and take shorter trips in the car
because that's what's right.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.104
Me? I'm not backin' down.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.231
I'm not givin' in.

30:58.815 --> 31:03.611
They can beat me. They can rob me.
I'll keep comin' back.

31:04.404 --> 31:08.199
They can stomp on me until I'm just
a little grease spot on the floor,

31:08.283 --> 31:11.661
and someone else will jump in my place.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.414
Life triumphs.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.833
Love triumphs.

31:16.916 --> 31:22.088
I'm a man, and I'm gonna hold my head up
and walk like one.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.675
-Yeah.
-(applause)

31:27.135 --> 31:28.970
Saucer men gave me this outfit.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.681
-(all laughing)
-Oh, my God.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.813
I can't expect streetwise
veterans like yourselves

31:38.897 --> 31:40.815
to lose any sleep over a thing like this.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
(jackhammer clanging in distance)

31:44.319 --> 31:46.279
I don't even expect you
to care one way or the other,

31:46.362 --> 31:48.114
but I'd like you
to take a look at it anyway.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.035
Take a good look.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.791
Hey. You got the prom pictures back, huh?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.545
Two people died in that room last night.

32:03.630 --> 32:07.592
A third is listed in critical condition
at St. Matthew's with a fractured skull--

32:07.675 --> 32:09.636
PHIL: Hey! Easy! Easy!

32:09.719 --> 32:11.888
-Easy. Easy.
-(shouting)

32:11.971 --> 32:13.431
Easy!

32:17.060 --> 32:21.105
A third is listed in critical condition
at St. Matthew's with a--

32:21.189 --> 32:24.859
-(jackhammer clanging)
-Fractured skull, two crushed hands...

32:24.943 --> 32:26.778
(drill whirring)

32:26.861 --> 32:29.656
...and a .22-caliber bullet
lodged in his spine.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.076
Phil, please.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.869
(whirring continues)

32:37.789 --> 32:39.791
FURILLO: The body next to the jukebox

32:40.750 --> 32:43.461
-was the 46-year-old mother of three.
-(whirring stops)

32:46.255 --> 32:51.052
She was raped four times
before being shot to death.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.263
Some ugly scene, man.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.392
Hey. What is this place?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.602
FURILLO: For those of you who slept
in this morning,

32:59.686 --> 33:01.854
or who just can't tell
from those photographs,

33:01.938 --> 33:04.273
that's the bar at Jefferson and 17th.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.192
JESUS: Yo, Furillo.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.114
I get the distinct impression
you're implying gang business here.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.659
Not that I would put it
past some of these mutants.

33:14.742 --> 33:18.246
-Hey, look! Who you calling a mutant?
-The bar is on Diablo turf, bean dip.

33:18.746 --> 33:22.166
-Exactly my point, poof butt.
-PHIL: Come on.

33:22.917 --> 33:26.129
The individuals involved
in this were wearing colors.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.964
Three jackets, all the same design.

33:28.047 --> 33:31.843
-That makes it gang work.
-MAN: Could have been renegades, Furillo.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.636
Or outsiders.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.015
Why don't you get down to it?
What do you want from us?

33:37.098 --> 33:39.934
I want the people who did it.
It's as simple as that.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.480
Either you already know who did it,
or you can find out.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.025
Man's got to be crazy.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.485
Even if they was affiliates,
which they ain't,

33:49.569 --> 33:53.239
I mean, what makes you think we're gonna
turn chuck-belly and hand 'em over to you?

33:53.740 --> 33:57.118
FURILLO: Because I won't have this kind
of sickness in my precinct.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.621
Somebody's gonna pay
for what happened last night.

34:00.705 --> 34:04.250
If not them, then all of you.
Do you understand that?

34:07.962 --> 34:09.714
I don't care if they're rebels

34:09.797 --> 34:12.008
or charter members
or your own damn brothers,

34:12.091 --> 34:16.679
I want 'em in hand on my doorstep
by tonight at the latest.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.099
-Or what?
-You remember the old days, Pagano?

34:25.021 --> 34:28.066
You remember what it was like
before I took over up here?

34:28.858 --> 34:31.861
No treaties. No sit-downs.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.198
Police settling issues
with leaded flashlights.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.742
You remember what interrogation
used to be like?

34:37.825 --> 34:39.494
(man laughing)

34:42.497 --> 34:43.790
You listen to this.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.627
You try to protect the scum that did this,
and I swear to God,

34:47.710 --> 34:49.295
the old days are gonna seem like a picnic

34:49.378 --> 34:51.839
compared to what starts
around here tomorrow morning.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.140
It's a two-way street, Furillo.

35:01.224 --> 35:04.811
You have until close of business tonight,
or all deals are off.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.230
That's it. You can go now.

35:07.313 --> 35:11.609
-Hey. Wait a second, man. I want to know--
-I said the meeting's over.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.196
I believe you gentlemen know the way out.
Come on.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.241
BATES: Come on. Let's go. Right this way.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.204
COFFEY: Yeah. Just move. Just move.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.585
You have something to say to me?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.380
I think you're making a big mistake here,
Frankie.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.258
You just can't push these guys
around like that.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.011
I haven't even started to push.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.097
(chattering)

35:43.599 --> 35:45.726
COFFEY: Come on, man. You deaf now? Move.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.862
Yeah, right. "Relax, Bobby.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.405
How much smarts does it take
to rewire one lousy car?"

35:57.488 --> 36:01.075
You're hangin' an albatross
around the neck of this relationship.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.160
-Sarge, excuse me, but...
-What?

36:02.243 --> 36:06.122
Renko here would like to explain why our
unit will be on the blocks for two days.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.791
-Later, Renko, huh?
-I didn't want to explain anything.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.709
-You did.
-I didn't want to explain--

36:09.792 --> 36:12.712
Deal with it, then, 'cause
it ain't my way. Let's go.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.422
Hey, Cookie.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.508
I'd like to find that little mechanical
wizard buddy of yours.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.260
What's his name?
I'm in need of a referral.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.138
(sighs) He went to the movies
on the five-spot you gave him. All right?

36:22.221 --> 36:24.348
-Gee. Let's go, fellas.
-Wasted youth.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.309
And a wasted five bucks.

36:37.945 --> 36:41.991
<i>The Concrete Galápagos:</i>
<i>Reverse Evolution and the Inner City,</i>

36:42.074 --> 36:43.367
by Heinrich Pendergrast.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.579
-Have you read it, Frank?
-No, Howard. I missed that one.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.539
Oh, it's portentous stuff, Frank.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.625
You oughta take a look at it.

36:52.835 --> 36:57.632
It's like<i> The Origin of the Species </i>meets,
uh, the subsidized housing set.

36:58.257 --> 36:59.800
They forward the notion

37:00.426 --> 37:03.596
that, uh, ghetto inbreeding, food stamps

37:03.679 --> 37:07.225
and, uh, federal intervention
in the natural selection process

37:07.308 --> 37:10.311
is setting your, uh,
your basic brown types

37:10.394 --> 37:13.272
on a virtual genetic collision course

37:13.981 --> 37:15.399
with Peking man.

37:17.151 --> 37:21.239
You know, uh, cave drawings
in the holding cells, Frank.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.950
Those little, uh,
buffalo pictures on the walls.

37:25.993 --> 37:26.994
(sighs)

37:27.745 --> 37:30.539
Okay, Howard.
What are you trying to tell me?

37:30.623 --> 37:34.085
(chuckles)
I caught your act downstairs, old sport.

37:34.168 --> 37:37.255
Doggone it, Frank, I was pleased as punch.

37:37.338 --> 37:41.092
You have finally seen the light
and decided to take a hard line

37:41.175 --> 37:43.678
with these degenerative little sociopaths.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.429
Now, you just give me the word,

37:45.888 --> 37:47.765
and I'll give them the purge

37:47.848 --> 37:52.603
that would make Dien Bien Phu
a "dolgarn" weenie roast.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.357
I'll keep that in mind, Howard.

38:12.498 --> 38:13.666
MURRAY: That-a-boy, kid. That's it.

38:13.749 --> 38:15.167
-That's using your smarts.
-LARUE: Leo! Leo!

38:15.251 --> 38:17.295
-Leo! Leo!
-Tie it to the crossbar.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.922
-That's it. Go ahead. Put it on.
-Shut up, you scum! Shut up!

38:20.006 --> 38:22.633
-I figured you for some kind of pig.
-Shut up. Kid, I swear to God.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.553
You're gonna miss an awful lot of wild
nights upstate, kid. Go ahead. Do it.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.887
I'll get you help. Take it easy.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.848
Give it a rest.
You ain't shut up since you got here.

38:28.931 --> 38:32.435
-(clanging)
-Leo! Leo!

38:32.518 --> 38:33.936
-(shouting) Hey!
-Don't do it.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.187
Forget about it.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.356
-You're gonna be dead... (indistinct)
-Leo!

38:37.440 --> 38:39.233
That-a-boy! Do it! Do it! Yes!

38:39.317 --> 38:41.110
-No! Leo!
-Yes!

38:44.947 --> 38:48.701
-(chattering)
-Attempted suicide.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.538
That's a classic play for sympathy, Frank.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.208
Typical of your, uh, child molester types.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.252
-(chattering)
-MAN: Give me some room here.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.588
The critical case
from this morning just died.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.757
So long, freak.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.512
MAN: Watch the stairs.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.517
Oh, my God.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.856
-I need a drink.
-No, you don't, J.D.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.524
(sighs)

39:23.611 --> 39:24.528
MAN: Where do you want
to put him, Lieutenant?

39:24.612 --> 39:25.988
CALLETANO: Holding Cell A upstairs.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.448
You can get through this.

39:28.783 --> 39:34.413
(spits) Stinkin' cop. Creeps.
Why don't you kiss him?

39:49.637 --> 39:50.930
Counselor, Henry.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.226
See?

40:05.528 --> 40:08.406
(chattering)

40:14.870 --> 40:16.747
I had a cup of coffee
with Henry Goldblume.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.583
I'm sorry about your day.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.711
There's nothing to be sorry about.
We simply have to do our job now.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.589
-Any leads?
-Nope.

40:28.384 --> 40:32.596
Sounds to me like what really angers you
is that this happened on your turf.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.265
Joyce, I got three people dead,

40:34.348 --> 40:35.975
a gang of monsters
are running around out there,

40:36.058 --> 40:37.560
and a guy just tried to
hang himself downstairs,

40:37.643 --> 40:39.812
and you're giving me Freudian analysis.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.397
I don't need that today.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.529
What are you doing up here anyway?
Somebody's civil rights being violated?

40:48.821 --> 40:52.241
As a matter of fact, yes, but I think
I can take that up with the lieutenant.

40:55.202 --> 40:59.123
(clears throat)
If you, uh, care to talk about any of this

40:59.540 --> 41:01.792
dreary psychological drivel further,

41:03.252 --> 41:05.045
I'm available for dinner tonight.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.302
(door slams)

41:21.479 --> 41:23.189
I got every right to be hard on you,
Captain.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.483
What you did out there was real dumb.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.443
You could have got me seriously hurt.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.111
Or yourself.

41:30.529 --> 41:33.491
You look like a dummy out there,
you know. Pathetic.

41:35.159 --> 41:38.329
So, I'm kickin' you loose this time,

41:38.412 --> 41:42.249
but you gotta promise me that you won't do
this crazy stuff no more.

41:42.875 --> 41:43.918
It ain't workin'.

41:44.585 --> 41:45.920
-It isn't?
-No, it isn't.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.964
The problems are more complex
than you think.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.383
-They are?
-Yes, they are.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.554
I'm the one who's supposed
to fight the bad guys.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.556
That's what they pay me for.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.684
Those other people
around here, the same way.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.814
I think you gotta find
something else to do, okay?

42:09.443 --> 42:14.573
Well, they do need me on Mars.
There's a serious crime problem there.

42:15.991 --> 42:19.995
-I have to build a spaceship.
-Yeah. Take your time. Do it right.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.081
(keys jingle)

42:28.671 --> 42:31.340
Thank you, Leo.
You want to get the man his cape?

42:34.593 --> 42:38.097
You know, uh,
I could've broken through these bars,

42:38.180 --> 42:40.975
but that would've been destruction
of public property.

42:41.058 --> 42:44.770
I'm sorry I couldn't let you have
these things in the cell. Rules.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.022
You and I, Mick.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.192
We're cut from the same fabric.

42:50.276 --> 42:53.487
We know what's out there.
We fight the same fight.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.659
Here. That's my card.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.705
Ever get into trouble, you just show this,

43:04.331 --> 43:06.875
and, uh, you could tell 'em
you're a friend of mine.

43:08.335 --> 43:11.338
Well, if you're ever in need
of the services of Captain Freedom,

43:11.672 --> 43:13.632
just hang a red flag from your rooftop.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.843
-Or a blanket.
-Thanks, Captain.

43:15.926 --> 43:18.178
-An old beach towel will be okay.
-I got ya.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.390
Can I leave by the window?

43:22.099 --> 43:24.268
Ah, come on.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.147
When I was ten,
I wanted to be Stan Musial.

43:29.148 --> 43:31.066
(scoffs) I told you that.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.487
I wanted to be strong.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.033
I wanted to be good.

43:40.868 --> 43:44.163
I wanted to be everything
everybody ever expected of me.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.836
I never thought I'd be what I am now.

43:53.213 --> 43:56.342
Because of something inside,
I thought I could make a difference.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.093
You do.

43:59.845 --> 44:00.763
A great deal.

44:05.225 --> 44:08.062
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

44:11.607 --> 44:14.818
It's the kind of place
that falls off maps though.

44:19.114 --> 44:22.368
The Hill. My turf.

44:26.664 --> 44:30.793
-(pager beeping)
-Oh, I'm sorry.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.586
-(beeping stops)
-Excuse me.

44:36.840 --> 44:41.095
Uh, Francis, we received an anonymous tip
on three juveniles. Uh...

44:41.637 --> 44:44.515
PHIL:
<i>The tipster had a very Spanish accent.</i>

44:45.349 --> 44:49.061
Off the record,
I think it was Jesus Martinez.

45:19.758 --> 45:20.926
Stuff from the bar.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.553
Wallets, effects.

45:32.771 --> 45:34.898
(chattering on police radio)

45:36.900 --> 45:39.027
Take 'em to the hall.
We'll talk in the morning.

45:39.111 --> 45:42.281
(siren wailing in distance)

45:45.659 --> 45:46.660
Kids, Frank.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.038
Sociopaths.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.654
-(sighs)
-(thunder rumbling)

46:22.738 --> 46:24.698
(chattering on police radio)

46:24.782 --> 46:26.200
Where do you put your hate?

46:41.298 --> 46:43.759
Red Dog 1. Regroup on me. Over.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.844
(engine starts)

47:01.860 --> 47:02.945
(barks)

47:23.173 --> 47:24.174
I owe you.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.761
You're damn right you owe me, Furillo.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.597
They scared you too, didn't they?

47:34.309 --> 47:35.644
Later, Furillo.

47:37.145 --> 47:38.397
Later.

47:43.902 --> 47:46.071
Hi, Fay. I know it's late.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.073
No, no.

47:49.408 --> 47:51.243
(stutters) I... I'm f-- I'm fine.

47:51.326 --> 47:52.828
Listen. Is Frank Jr. still up?

47:53.328 --> 47:55.664
Yeah. I'd like to. Thanks.

47:59.376 --> 48:00.419
Hi, son.

48:01.086 --> 48:02.296
How are you?

48:02.880 --> 48:03.964
I'm fine.

48:04.673 --> 48:07.217
-What are you watching?
-(ship horn blows)

48:09.595 --> 48:10.762
Is it good?

48:11.805 --> 48:12.848
Oh, that's great.

48:14.474 --> 48:17.936
No, no. No.
I... I just wanted to see how you are.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.650
Right.

48:25.110 --> 48:27.112
-(thunder rumbling)
-Good night.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.409
I love you, son.

48:42.377 --> 48:44.838
(closing theme playing)
