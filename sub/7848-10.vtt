PARKING LOT.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.567
WHOA. CHICKS.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.467
AND A FOXY HEN.
YEAH.

18:21.467 --> 18:26.100
THAT'S NEVER
HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY
OF CAMP KNOCK-A-NUMBER.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.033
I GOT THE BLONDE.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.467
YOU'LL GET NOTHING
AND LIKE IT.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.867
OOH. SASSY.

18:34.367 --> 18:35.100
WELL, WHAT'S UP?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.000
WE'RE HERE
TO BREAK YOU OUT.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.033
PACK YOUR STUFF.

18:38.033 --> 18:38.600
WHY?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.934
I KNEW YOU WERE
HAVING A LOUSY TIME.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.200
I GOT YOUR
TWIN TELEPATHY CALL.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.100
WELL, IT MUST HAVE
BEEN YOUR OTHER TWIN,

18:45.100 --> 18:46.567
BECAUSE I'M HAVING
A GREAT TIME,

18:46.567 --> 18:47.900
AND I'M REALLY
LEARNING A LOT.

18:47.900 --> 18:51.467
UH-OH. IT'S WORSE
THAN I THOUGHT.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.100
UH, GUYS, WOULD YOU MIND

18:54.100 --> 18:57.667
IF I TALK TO ZACK
IN PRIVATE FOR A MINUTE?

18:57.667 --> 18:58.400
COME ON, CUTIE.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.700
LET'S TAKE A STROLL
DOWN CALCULUS LANE.

19:00.700 --> 19:01.500
OH, NO.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.500
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT A CALCULATOR
THAT RUNS ON MOONLIGHT.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.867
OH! LET'S FIGURE OUT
HOW RICH I AM!

19:07.867 --> 19:10.500
HEY, WAIT FOR ME!

19:10.500 --> 19:18.100
ANYBODY AROUND
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 25 AND 28?!

19:18.100 --> 19:21.467
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY TWIN TELEPATHY
IS TELLING ME?

19:21.467 --> 19:23.033
YOU MISSED ME.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.600
♪ YOU MISSED ME,
YOU MISSED ME ♪

19:25.600 --> 19:26.834
DID NOT.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.000
DID SO.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.867
DID NOT.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.900
I-IT WAS MOM
WHO MISSED YOU.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.467
SHE JUST SITS
ON THE SOFA

19:32.467 --> 19:33.600
LOOKING AT
YOUR BABY PICTURES,

19:33.600 --> 19:36.734
CRYING, AND
EATING ICE CREAM
WITH A SHOVEL.

19:36.734 --> 19:37.700
OH. THAT'S FUNNY,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.767
BECAUSE SHE CALLED ME
TONIGHT AFTER DINNER,

19:39.767 --> 19:44.467
AND SHE BRAGGED
ABOUT HOW WELL SHE WAS
DOING ON HER DIET.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.000
WELL, SHE LIED.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.200
NO. YOU LIED.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.600
♪ YOU MISSED ME,
YOU MISSED ME ♪

19:50.600 --> 19:52.367
IS THAT BLANKIE?

19:52.367 --> 19:54.867
YEAH. I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT MISS IT.

19:54.867 --> 19:55.567
I DID. THANKS.

19:55.567 --> 20:01.033
SO YOU MISS A LOUSY BLANKET,
BUT NOT YOUR TWIN BROTHER?

20:01.767 --> 20:05.767
OK. MAYBE I MISSED YOU
A LITTLE.

20:05.767 --> 20:08.834
BUT NOT ENOUGH
TO COME HOME EARLY.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.600
OH. OK.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.400
I UNDERSTAND.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.200
YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY,
WE ACTUALLY
WILL BE APART.

20:15.200 --> 20:15.700
WELL, SURE.

20:15.700 --> 20:21.400
WHEN YOU'RE A MATH PROFESSOR
AND I'M A RACECAR DRIVER-
SLASH-SECRET AGENT.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.367
I'LL BE HOME
IN 6 DAYS.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.100
THINK YOU CAN
MAKE IT?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.400
[SIGHS] SURE.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.567
HECK, IF LONDON'S DRIVING,

20:27.567 --> 20:30.500
WE WON'T EVEN BE HOME
FOR 6 DAYS.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.500
AND IF MURIEL'S DRIVING,

20:33.500 --> 20:35.967
I'M GONNA NEED BLANKIE.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.900
WHY DID I HAVE TO
GET THE HUMP?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.300
WELL, YOU COULD'VE
DRIVEN BACK

20:40.300 --> 20:42.000
WITH MURIEL
IN THE OTHER CAR.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.600
DID I MENTION HOW MUCH
I LOVE THE HUMP?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
WELL, I HOPE
YOU LOVE YOUR ROOM,

20:45.600 --> 20:50.200
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA BE UNTIL YOU
ARE OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.133
DON'T EVER SCARE ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.600
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
EYES ON THE ROAD.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.667
CHECK YOUR MIRRORS.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.967
EYES ON THE ROAD!

20:56.967 --> 20:59.200
I CAN'T DO BOTH.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.867
WOULD YOU STOP?
SHE'S DOING FINE.

21:01.867 --> 21:02.500
ISN'T HE THE WORST?

21:02.500 --> 21:06.767
ON THE WAY UP HERE,
HE ACTUALLY CRITICIZED
MY DRIVING...

21:06.767 --> 21:09.367
WHILE HE WAS DRIVING!

21:09.367 --> 21:11.667
WELL, IN ALL
FAIRNESS TO LONDON,
I HAVE TO SAY,

21:11.667 --> 21:14.300
EVEN THOUGH
I WAS BEING HELD
AGAINST MY WILL--

21:14.300 --> 21:15.934
AND MY LAWYERS
WILL BE IN TOUCH--

21:15.934 --> 21:18.033
SHE DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB
DRIVING UP HERE.

21:18.033 --> 21:22.467
I SUPPOSE I HAVE
A SLIGHT TENDENCY
TO BE A BIT CRITICAL.

21:22.467 --> 21:24.200
SUPPOSE?
SLIGHT?

21:24.200 --> 21:27.000
TENDENCY?
A BIT?

21:27.667 --> 21:29.367
OK, OK.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.600
I'M SORRY, LONDON.

21:33.467 --> 21:35.033
IT'S OK, MOSEBY.

21:35.033 --> 21:37.033
HANDS ON
THE WHEEL!

21:37.033 --> 21:39.900
[TIRES SQUEALING]

21:44.033 --> 21:46.300
ALL RIGHT!
I WIN AGAIN!

21:46.300 --> 21:47.200
AND YOU ARE A LOSER!

21:47.200 --> 21:50.367
BUT I'M UP 33.8%
FROM MY PERSONAL BEST.

21:50.367 --> 21:51.800
IF I KEEP IMPROVING
AT THIS RATE,

21:51.800 --> 21:56.200
I'LL BEAT YOU
IN 21 YEARS, 4 MONTHS,
AND 3 DAYS!

21:56.200 --> 21:58.800
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
BUDDY.
