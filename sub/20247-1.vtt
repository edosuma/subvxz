03:59.197 --> 04:02.282
Now, Senator Friedman, you
have been a harsh critic...

04:02.367 --> 04:05.160
of the President in recent months
over his treatment of Russia.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.997
Russia is back. Their president
has stated unequivocally...

04:09.082 --> 04:11.458
their desire to knock us back to 1985.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.794
They've reignited
their nuclear program.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.130
Just last week they dropped three
Akula class subs in the Bering Sea.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.800
Our myopia over
the Middle East...

04:19.884 --> 04:23.845
has caused us to miss the big bear that's
just sitting in the middle of the room.

04:23.930 --> 04:28.308
Now, Senator Darden, you have numerous
business interests inside Russia.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.811
Do you share Senator
Friedman's fears here?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.814
My interests, as you
call them, in Russia...

04:33.898 --> 04:36.817
are strictly as a trade partner
for the good people of my state.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.987
All this saber rattling is basically
Senator Friedman's attempt...

04:40.071 --> 04:42.489
to get his budget
up for next year.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.325
Oh, Please. Russia now has ten
times the number of covert agents...

04:45.410 --> 04:47.995
within United States borders
as it did during the Cold War.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.665
What are we talking about? Besides,
wouldn't it be wise for you...

04:51.749 --> 04:55.043
to divest your interest of what you
have in Russia at a time like this?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.338
I am very transparent about all
of my financial transactions...

04:58.423 --> 05:02.009
which is why, you know, that
I did those things. Excuse me.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.887
The President would suggest that fear
is not helpful right now, Senator...

05:05.972 --> 05:09.725
that fear is obviously a very big
component of any politician's toolbox...

05:09.809 --> 05:13.061
but that it is not going
to help toward progress.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.397
Leaving.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.732
Thank God.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.364
Hello?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.575
You haven't accessed the money.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.869
Yeah, well, it's been
a little warm around here.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.079
We had a deal, Senator.
We have expectations.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.374
I don't give a good goddamn
about your expectations.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.917
Don't call
here again.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.212
Bastard's making a deal.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.547
Yeah, or blowing one off.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.549
Where does
that leave us?

05:42.633 --> 05:45.218
Darden just made contact. It
looks like he's moving now.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.906
Oh shit! He's down! He's
down! Behind the building!

06:15.666 --> 06:17.626
This is a domestic case!

06:17.710 --> 06:20.128
You have no jurisdiction,
authority, or right to be here.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.255
We've been trailing this
guy for the past month.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.758
This is a crime scene, not
a goddamn terrorist attack!

06:24.842 --> 06:26.301
You're going
to have to wait.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.929
Yeah? What am I
supposed to wait for?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.599
For him.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.230
There you go, sir.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.285
Director Highland.
Sir, why is the CIA-

06:55.415 --> 06:58.250
This is Agent Weaver.
Yes, sir.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.836
Yes, sir.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.630
We're out!

07:03.714 --> 07:05.799
Who the hell was that?

07:05.883 --> 07:09.052
Director Bell. He wants us out.
No questions and not a word.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.973
You guys were
on the stakeout?

07:13.057 --> 07:16.476
Yes, sir. He's had contact with
Moscow off and on for a month now.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.186
But he never went
any further-

07:18.271 --> 07:20.313
We know that. What
happened here tonight?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.983
Someone grabbed him from
behind. Right in our blind spot.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.277
It all happened
so goddamned fast.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.714
Keep your eye on it!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.020
Excuse me? Do you know the time?

08:00.104 --> 08:03.356
No, no. I don't have a watch. Sorry.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.359
It's okay. Just, my husband
said he'd be here by nine.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.819
Oh.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.406
Which boy is yours?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.409
Decker, the second
baseman.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.037
Oh, yeah.
He's good.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.705
Got a strong arm.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.208
I'm Molly.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.710
PauI. Hey.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.378
Which one's yours?

08:25.463 --> 08:26.922
One more, guys!

08:27.006 --> 08:30.050
Oh, no, I don't,
I don't have-

08:30.134 --> 08:33.220
No, I live
nearby here.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.056
I come by just to see
a game once in a while.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.851
That's really nice.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.207
Not a care
in the world, huh?

09:04.168 --> 09:05.752
Jeez!

09:09.006 --> 09:13.093
I never thought I'd see the day when
someone got the drop on Paul Shepherdson.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.428
Yeah, yeah. How did you get in here?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.097
It's what we do.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.391
The phone rings,
too, you know.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.981
It's Cassius.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.026
He's back.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.656
Tom.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.575
Cassius is
long gone.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.620
He hasn't even been heard
from in over 20 years.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.123
Tell that
to Senator Darden.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.625
He's Iying in an alley
with his throat slit.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.836
Then it's a copycat.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.922
That's what everyone is
saying. Well, almost everyone.

09:54.385 --> 09:59.014
Tom, there was a point where I
knew this man better than myself.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.309
Cassius is dead.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.686
For once, PauI,
I think you're wrong.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.953
Welcome back, sir.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.968
Gentlemen.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.388
PauI, this is
Director Roger Bell.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.848
Mr. Shepherdson.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.516
The FBI?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.518
Bureaucracy has
changed, my friend.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.687
We have to share
the burden now.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.522
As you know,
PauI was responsible...

10:49.607 --> 10:51.524
for tracking down
the Cassius Seven...

10:51.609 --> 10:53.568
The Soviet assassins
we code-named...

10:53.653 --> 10:56.237
for the Roman senators
who killed Julius Caesar.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.032
And you caught them all but
one, from what I understand.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.242
Missed Cassius
himself?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.536
That's right.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.206
But this is not his
work. I'm sure of it.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.541
Oh, I think it is.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.418
Who the hell
is this?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.213
This is one of my men. Agent Ben Geary.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.257
Probably knows more about your
assassin than anyone we've got.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.927
Or the CIA,
for that matter.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.555
Paul, we'd like the two
of you to work together.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.433
Is that so?
So tell me, Geary...

11:25.518 --> 11:28.269
what were you doing
when the wall came down?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.563
I was watching it
on television.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.233
Just like everyone
else in this room.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.862
Could you pull up
the case file, please?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.742
Okay, here is good.
Notice how the cut starts...

11:42.827 --> 11:45.245
right in the center of
the throat, moving upwards.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.914
Typically, a cut starts
high, moves lateral...

11:47.998 --> 11:50.750
as the right-handed killer
pulls the knife from ear to ear.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.586
Not Cassius. His cuts were
always exactly the same.

11:53.671 --> 11:57.257
Right-handed, but up, and
starting in the middle of the neck.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.259
I've never been able
to figure out why.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.970
Still, it's
a copycat.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.431
This guy's
the best you've got?

12:04.515 --> 12:09.102
Mr. Shepherdson, I wrote my
Master's thesis on Cassius.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.312
And I have tracked
down and interviewed...

12:11.397 --> 12:14.441
every one of the few witnesses
of his crimes who are still alive.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.444
I've even re-created and personally
walked the approaches and exits...

12:17.528 --> 12:20.113
of all his known kills step
for step. I know this man.

12:20.197 --> 12:24.659
And there is no doubt in my
mind. This is the work of Cassius.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.411
You know him?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.789
Harvard, right?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.667
Yes, that's right.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.296
And you were the son of a
foreign attachÃ© in Turkey.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.467
My father worked at
embassies all over the world.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.968
How do you know this?

12:42.052 --> 12:43.678
I read your thesis.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.805
You did?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.141
And I know you were trying
for months to talk to me.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.686
I'll tell you why I refused. Because
you have never been on the ground.

12:51.771 --> 12:56.649
Because you don't know him.
And because you're a librarian.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.693
Mr. Shepherdson.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.988
Let's just say, Geary, that
I'm wrong and you expose him.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.990
What do you
think comes next?

13:04.074 --> 13:07.660
You think maybe he's
gonna come after you?

13:07.745 --> 13:11.122
That is exactly
why I'm here.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.504
I'm going home.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.715
And I'd like to be
left alone. All right?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.967
We've got Brutus.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.846
What?

13:26.931 --> 13:30.350
Igor Ivanovich Kozak,
aka Brutus...

13:30.434 --> 13:33.186
is alive and locked up in
Brinkerman Penitentiary.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.064
That's impossible. He killed
him in Salzburg in 1989.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.192
I shot him in the chest.
He fell three stories.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.735
And survived.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.195
Why didn't you tell me?

13:42.279 --> 13:43.905
You wanted
to retire, PauI.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.908
I'm afraid retirees
lose certain privileges.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.661
You know what?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.705
I'm done here, Tom.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.962
Get me Highland.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.303
Come on, I know you're
there. Get me Highland.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.764
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.309
Director Highland wants you
to know he has a meeting...

14:54.393 --> 14:56.102
with the President
tomorrow morning.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.897
He said you'd know
what that means.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.843
Good morning.
Two regulars, please.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.970
Good morning, sir.
Coming right up.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.519
Spooks aren't supposed
to be creatures of habit.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.814
It's a luxury one can only
afford when one is in charge.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.399
Thank you.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.943
Thank you very much.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.737
Thanks.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.165
I gave you
20 years, Tom.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.835
You promised me
I could have a life.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.505
I never cared much for the
coffee at The White House.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.883
I think it's got something to
do with the 150-year-old china.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.013
I've been Director through
three presidents, PauI.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.849
And let's face it. I wouldn't have
gotten the job in the first place...

16:16.934 --> 16:19.435
if you hadn't helped us
with the Cassius Seven.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.523
In 15 minutes, the President is gonna
tell me I don't have this job anymore...

16:23.607 --> 16:26.526
if we can't naiI the guy
that killed Senator Darden.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.486
It's not Cassius, Tom.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.322
You never caught him.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.121
Because he's dead.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.374
Then prove it.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.575
Mr. Shepherdson?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.801
So, PauI Shepherdson.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.137
Been an analyst for the company
here in Paris for three years.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.014
What do you
wanna see me about?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.266
The Cassius Seven.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.646
I've had a breakthrough.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.273
I can take them
down for you.

18:44.748 --> 18:48.167
I'll take care of it.
Just give me about 15 minutes.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.877
Oh, hey.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.504
And? And,
and, and, and?

18:51.588 --> 18:52.839
I don't know.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.340
Director Bell
was there?

18:54.424 --> 18:56.425
Everyone was there.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.220
Jesus! I've been at this
place a year longer than you...

18:59.304 --> 19:02.014
and I've never even seen
the Director in person.

19:02.099 --> 19:06.185
They're gonna put you in the
field, man. I'm sure of it.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.354
They haven't said
anything, yet.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.232
You were right about this
thing the whole time, huh?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.195
Agent Geary.
Yes, sir.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.114
Yes, sir.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.325
Yes, sir.
I'll be there.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.745
And?

19:30.794 --> 19:33.004
I'm in.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.111
This is crazy.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.448
'Cause I have spent so much time
studying your work with Cassius.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.241
I feeI like
I know you.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.785
You don't.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.414
Yeah. No, I just mean I
- I, you know, I put myself in your shoes.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.917
I just tried to think
how you would think.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.086
I've all of these crime scene
photos. A lot of them you're in.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.757
Actually, I should probably get
you to sign one of them. Right?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.468
That would definitely
be a first.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.971
When you were in Budapest in 91,
did you notice a specific pattern?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.140
No, Agent Geary.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.770
Tell me why-why
would a guy...

20:30.854 --> 20:33.606
who writes a thesis
on an internationaI spy...

20:33.690 --> 20:36.776
join the Bureau and
not Central Intelligence?

20:36.860 --> 20:41.447
Well, I believed that
Cassius was hiding in the U.S.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.575
Think about it. What better place
for a Soviet spook to retire?

20:46.411 --> 20:49.997
You believe that enough
to base a career on it?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.667
Uh, yeah.
You could say that.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.460
Can I ask you
something?

20:54.544 --> 20:59.131
If that means you'll
stop talking, yeah.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.009
Why didn't they
tell you about Brutus?

21:02.094 --> 21:05.846
If it was your job to catch the Cassius
Seven, what were they scared you'd do?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.101
Kill him.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.833
What's in the bag?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.209
Motivation.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.670
You think
he's gonna talk?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.130
Not to me.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.768
He's been cleared!

22:24.968 --> 22:27.053
You speak Russian, huh?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.388
I studied
in schooI. Yes.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.850
Here's some
Russian for you.

22:38.523 --> 22:42.109
I've read that you
worked with Cassius.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.904
It's a different
life ago.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.572
Do you know
where he's hiding?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.909
Why would you-

22:52.162 --> 22:53.913
Is Cassius alive?

22:53.997 --> 22:55.373
He killed
a Senator.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.712
Who are you?

23:06.510 --> 23:11.305
I understand that you've been looking
for one of these for about 10 years.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.941
Give it to me.

23:22.025 --> 23:25.236
Tell me something that I don't
know about Cassius and it is yours.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.989
A chance to hear
the outside world?

23:29.074 --> 23:30.950
Give it to me,
you son of a whore!

23:31.034 --> 23:33.285
Tell me something about
Cassius. Did he train you?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.954
What does
he look like?

23:50.887 --> 23:54.265
I guess you can spend the
rest of your life in silence.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.935
Guard?

23:59.062 --> 24:00.813
Wait!

24:05.735 --> 24:07.653
Okay.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.699
He made his name
as a soldier.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.828
But rather than take the easy
route through the academia...

24:15.912 --> 24:18.497
he honed
other skills.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.207
And he trained you?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.377
He trained us
all... his way.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.338
He only wanted the best.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.132
For that he
wanted proof.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.518
Only six
of us survived.

24:39.603 --> 24:44.190
And together we became
your Cassius Seven.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.066
And you never
saw him again?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.068
No.

24:48.153 --> 24:52.198
We got our targets from him
through the usuaI channels.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.034
But he planned
the kills.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.746
His inteI was
always the best.

24:58.830 --> 25:02.541
His instinct for when to
strike, always sharpest.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.376
What happened
to him?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.712
He made mistake.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.757
He lived
outside parameters.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.550
What kind
of parameters?

25:11.635 --> 25:14.887
Parameters of
an assassin.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.555
What did you
do to him?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.057
Give him
the radio.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.725
No, no. I wanna
hear specifically-

25:19.809 --> 25:21.393
I said give him
the radio!

25:21.478 --> 25:23.646
Just do it!
Give it to him.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.735
All right.
Let's go.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.780
Come on!

25:38.036 --> 25:40.412
Guard.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.754
What the hell
was that?

25:48.838 --> 25:51.090
Why didn't you let me finish
my line of questioning?

25:51.174 --> 25:52.758
Because he was Iying.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.927
I tried to kill him
once for a reason.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.096
Yeah, but the wire
makes perfect sense.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.473
It explains why the cuts
always start from the middle...

25:59.558 --> 26:01.934
and then work their way up.
This opens up everything.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.978
I gotta get in there
early tomorrow morning...

26:04.062 --> 26:06.605
and compare the cuts with
other wire killings in Europe.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.848
What do we got?

27:22.932 --> 27:24.350
Cramping and
vomiting blood.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.809
Okay, get him
into three.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.567
Somebody get these
restraints off!

27:33.652 --> 27:35.069
Excuse me.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.030
Can I get a bowI?
BowI, please!

27:38.114 --> 27:39.198
Got it.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.869
Batteries.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.748
Stay back!

27:51.294 --> 27:53.921
All right, get me security!

28:16.986 --> 28:19.571
You swallowed the
batteries, didn't you?

28:19.656 --> 28:23.200
Easier to escape from a
hospital than a prison.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.089
Geneva.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.591
You were there,
weren't you?

28:39.676 --> 28:41.927
I know
nothing about-

28:42.011 --> 28:43.929
You were there.
It was you.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.432
I never killed
anyone in Geneva.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.768
You are a liar.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.770
Who are you?

28:51.855 --> 28:55.274
I'm the one who shot you in Salzburg.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.239
I'm also the one who
trained you in Moscow.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.667
Cassius?

29:15.712 --> 29:20.632
I never... I never knew about
Geneva untiI after the fact.

29:20.717 --> 29:25.012
They brought in someone
with-with no ties to you.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.514
Yeah, the others
said that, too.

29:27.599 --> 29:32.644
Did they tell you it was
someone from the Black Caucasus?

29:32.729 --> 29:35.314
A soldier, I think.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.028
We could find
him together.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.322
We are from
the same place.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.620
I've looked up
to you my whole life.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.523
Agent Geary.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.984
Agent Geary. We need to meet.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.020
Oh.

33:06.609 --> 33:09.152
You need to drop
this investigation.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.699
How exactly am I supposed to drop it?

33:13.783 --> 33:18.370
Cassius doesn't care
who he has to eliminate.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.331
If he comes after me,
I'm prepared. Not you.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.209
You've got a wife.
You have two kids.

33:24.293 --> 33:28.213
Yeah. I think they understand
what I'm doing is important.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.550
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do if you find him?

33:31.634 --> 33:33.593
That is all
I think about.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.887
And now that it's reaI, I want it more.

33:35.972 --> 33:39.891
I want to know him.
I want to understand him.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.601
And then?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.688
And then I wanna put him away, for good.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.904
Whoa. What is all this shit?

33:52.989 --> 33:54.573
It's research.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.116
Research.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.412
Volks-Volkskrant-Volks.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.248
De Volkskrant. It's a
daily newspaper in Holland.

34:03.332 --> 34:06.084
The third page there's a
story about a wire killing.

34:06.169 --> 34:09.254
Ten days before the Soviets
held their first open election.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.797
Cassius?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.966
Yeah. I think so.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.260
You've gotta put in a word
to get me on this case.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.763
Please. I'm up to my ass in
banking bullshit. I'm serious.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.435
Agent Geary.

34:23.518 --> 34:24.770
Where?

34:29.025 --> 34:31.150
Once you're done getting
shots of the body...

34:31.235 --> 34:34.821
really get the cut patterns.
I want close-ups of the neck.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.138
And then he
came in here?

35:00.223 --> 35:01.556
Yes, sir.

35:26.582 --> 35:29.668
Hey, PauI.

35:29.752 --> 35:33.004
Agent Geary. What do
you got? See you later.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.883
Apparently Brutus swallowed the
batteries from the radio that we gave him.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.011
I'm guessing he put out some
calls. Found a place to lay low.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.389
Word got back
to Cassius.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.225
He's never one
to allow loose ends.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.019
Loose ends, meaning
he spoke to us.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.897
Probably. Yeah.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.400
Well, we should get
all the phone records...

35:53.484 --> 35:56.528
of every cell phone
hospitaI extension here.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.904
All right.
Okay.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.744
You know, I always
had this theory...

36:06.789 --> 36:09.833
that Cassius would return
to the scene of his crimes.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.920
Watch his investigators.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.549
You think
he's that vain?

36:17.633 --> 36:21.094
Well, I think that
some of it's vanity.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.014
Some of it is he wants to
see what he's up against.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.066
You see that guy in
the back? Brown jacket.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.444
Coat's Russian made.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.741
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

36:42.825 --> 36:45.035
Shit! Move!

37:32.750 --> 37:36.127
All right. Why don't we split up?

37:36.212 --> 37:37.629
Yeah.

37:37.713 --> 37:39.172
You go that way.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.898
I've got nothing.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.941
Yeah, me neither.
Let the Bureau know.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.110
He's wearing
a brown suede jacket.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.237
Sandy blond hair,
close cropped.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.074
No. That wasn't him.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.409
He was too tall.

39:31.494 --> 39:36.081
Too military. Wrong build. Too young.
A million reasons. It wasn't him.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.291
What the hell were we
doing chasing this guy?

39:38.376 --> 39:41.711
He ran. I figured he'd
be arrested for something.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.137
You hungry?

40:10.866 --> 40:13.952
Hey, PauI. This is my wife, Natalie.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.162
Hello, Mr. Shepherdson.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.497
Hey. PauI.

40:17.581 --> 40:18.748
PauI.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.963
It's been a long time since I
went to someone's house for dinner.

40:25.047 --> 40:27.674
I, uh, I never learned
how to do it right.

40:27.758 --> 40:32.011
Well, it's easy. You just smile
and nod and tell me how good it is.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.638
Yes, ma'am.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.474
Ma'am? Did you hear that?

40:36.559 --> 40:38.143
Well, right
this way, sir.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.438
Let me welcome you
to our humble commode.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.706
Wanna help me
get dinner ready?

40:59.790 --> 41:02.333
Dinner ready?

41:02.418 --> 41:04.836
I'm not gonna be much
help. I'm sorry.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.881
It's easy. Just move the dad
from the backyard to the kitchen.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.966
That's your dad?
Let's see.

41:12.428 --> 41:15.513
Hey, PauI. Come meet this little guy.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.184
It's Nicholas.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.519
Wow.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.855
Yeah. Looks like you.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.064
No.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.691
Yeah. Got your nose.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.860
Everyone says
he looks like my dad.

41:28.944 --> 41:31.571
Which is nice 'cause we
lost him like ten years ago.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.072
Yeah, I'm sorry.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.365
No, no, it's fine.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.867
He's definitely
your kid.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.535
Do you have
any children, PauI?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.245
No. No, I don't.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.538
Do you want
a drink?

41:40.623 --> 41:42.373
Yeah.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.751
Yeah, sweetie.
Come on.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.544
You got his head?

41:46.629 --> 41:48.755
Come on, Lucy. Let's go set up, sweetie.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.423
PauI, what are
you looking for?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.050
Vodka martini?

41:52.134 --> 41:53.760
Sure.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.720
Dry. With, uh, an onion
if you've got it.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.722
You know what?

41:57.806 --> 42:00.725
I think you've been chasing
Cassius a little too long.

42:00.809 --> 42:03.019
That's his drink.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.608
Yeah. Well, trying
to get into his head...

42:08.692 --> 42:12.070
I guess I picked up
some of his habits.

42:12.154 --> 42:15.448
You know what? In that
case, I'm gonna join you.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.791
The kids are down. Finally.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.921
Now, I know you're
gonna say this is weird...

42:30.005 --> 42:34.092
but I feel a connection
with him. I do. With Cassius.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.928
He's not the kind of guy
that you can connect to.

42:37.012 --> 42:41.766
Well, sure. If not a connection,
then a tremendous amount of respect.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.435
All right. Let's just set
the record straight now.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.313
He's not worthy of your
respect or admiration.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.274
He's a
cold-blooded ki/er.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.985
He doesn't have
a family like you.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.612
He doesn't have
a wife like yours.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.948
His life
meant nothing.

42:57.032 --> 43:02.453
The only good thing he ever
did was disappear. All right?

43:02.538 --> 43:05.790
You don't think there's something
to be respected in the fact that...

43:05.874 --> 43:08.001
he is the best
at something?

43:08.085 --> 43:12.338
Respect is the last thing I have
for an animaI like him. Okay?

43:12.423 --> 43:14.132
Yeah. But-

43:15.926 --> 43:19.137
Hold that thought.
I'm gonna take a piss.

43:19.221 --> 43:21.639
Ben?

43:21.724 --> 43:23.808
I'm just stating
the facts.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.145
PauI, he's obsessed.

43:27.229 --> 43:28.813
Yeah, I know.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.149
And he has been ever
since I've known him.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.192
Cassius.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.153
And you!

43:35.237 --> 43:39.407
You know, I'm-I'm just
ready for it to be over.

43:44.246 --> 43:48.333
Your husband is messing
with a creature...

43:48.417 --> 43:51.669
he thinks he understands,
but he doesn't.

43:51.754 --> 43:55.006
He's allowed
your husband...

43:55.090 --> 43:59.510
to live this long because
he wasn't much of a threat.

43:59.595 --> 44:02.555
What do you mean,
allowed him to live?

44:02.640 --> 44:05.141
Do you think he knows who my husband is?

44:08.646 --> 44:10.647
I'm sure he does.

44:12.608 --> 44:15.151
You really
read my thesis?

44:16.612 --> 44:19.864
Yes. Yes, I read
your thesis.

44:19.948 --> 44:21.866
Yeah?

44:21.950 --> 44:23.618
And?

44:26.497 --> 44:28.665
All right.
I think...

44:30.459 --> 44:34.253
that you missed
an essential question.

44:34.338 --> 44:37.048
Okay. What's that?

44:37.132 --> 44:40.885
You pinpointed the wheres
and the hows of Cassius...

44:40.969 --> 44:44.389
but you never ask
the question why.

44:44.473 --> 44:48.726
Why were his targets
increasingly more random?

44:48.811 --> 44:50.895
Why did he disappear?

44:50.979 --> 44:54.232
When you can
answer those whys...

44:54.316 --> 44:56.192
then you'll know him.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.252
Thank Natalie
again, will you?

45:14.336 --> 45:17.130
Oh, we checked the
calls from the hospitaI.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.297
Yeah?

45:18.382 --> 45:21.092
Nothing.

45:21.176 --> 45:22.802
Tch. Too bad.

45:22.886 --> 45:25.430
Yeah.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.473
See, you know
the thing that-

45:27.558 --> 45:29.684
Okay, here's what
I don't understand.

45:29.768 --> 45:33.146
How did Cassius know that they
moved Brutus to a hospitaI...

45:33.230 --> 45:35.606
instead of just working
on him at the prison?

45:35.691 --> 45:39.777
The Russians probably paid
somebody off in the prison.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.321
They'd want him dead
just to shut him up.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.323
Right. Right.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.950
Good night, Geary.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.538
Gentlemen?

46:32.623 --> 46:34.832
I think you guys
know Martin Miller.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.376
He's our Chief Analyst
on domestic Russian ops.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.171
Go ahead, Marty.

46:40.255 --> 46:44.342
Almost six months ago, two B.P agents
were murdered and their truck stolen.

46:44.426 --> 46:48.179
The truck was located a week later
in a parking lot near TUS wiped clean.

46:48.263 --> 46:51.390
Now, these guys were smart. They parked
far enough away from the cameras...

46:51.475 --> 46:53.893
that we couldn't get
any faciaI recognition.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.854
Local cops and Border Patrol
assumed they were Mexican.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.148
Then we found this.

47:00.442 --> 47:02.568
A camera
in a squad car.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.238
That's right. Luckily,
Tucson police were testing...

47:05.322 --> 47:07.740
high-resolution
cameras in a few cars.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.910
All Russian.
All known operatives.

47:10.994 --> 47:13.704
All now in
the United States.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.415
There's the guy
with the Russian jacket.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.501
That's right.
And it gets better.

47:25.300 --> 47:27.426
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.520
Son-of-a-bitch.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.399
Bozlovski.

47:41.483 --> 47:43.609
That's right.
Johann Bozlovski.

47:43.694 --> 47:47.238
Former Spetsnaz
and KGB.

47:47.322 --> 47:51.868
In 1990, Bozlovski and his 1 Oth
Mountain Brigade in the Black Caucasus...

47:51.910 --> 47:55.746
went into Warsaw and executed known
allies of the solidarity movement.

47:55.831 --> 47:59.125
I looked for him
for a year...

47:59.209 --> 48:01.127
after the wall
came down.

48:01.211 --> 48:03.713
He just,
just vanished.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.927
Like Cassius.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.888
What are you
thinking, PauI?

48:13.348 --> 48:15.600
We have a known
Soviet hit man.

48:15.684 --> 48:19.270
Disappears into
Libya or Afghanistan.

48:19.354 --> 48:22.273
Same time our inteI tells
us Cassius does the same.

48:22.357 --> 48:24.483
Twenty years later,
he shows up.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.987
United States Senator
gets his throat slit.

48:28.071 --> 48:30.990
I- I don't know.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.451
I mean,
Bozlovski's Spetsnaz.

48:33.535 --> 48:35.953
And... he's
so visible.

48:36.038 --> 48:39.457
Well, yeah. Maybe
that's what they wanted.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.627
And wouldn't a more
visible alter ego...

48:42.711 --> 48:45.296
just muddy up the waters
for everyone chasing him?

48:45.380 --> 48:49.800
How did we know Boz
was in Warsaw in 1990?

48:49.885 --> 48:51.469
How did we know that?

48:51.553 --> 48:54.138
Because the Russians
told us so!

48:54.222 --> 48:57.308
Soviet disinformation was
the biggest weapon they had...

48:57.392 --> 48:58.976
before the wall
came down.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.478
That's true.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.610
Yeah.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.488
Bozlovski
makes sense.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.198
It's him.
He's the one.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.950
What do you guys
need from us?

49:14.034 --> 49:17.161
Nothing. Nothing.
He'll disappear again...

49:17.245 --> 49:19.914
if he knows
we're onto him.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.310
What is this place?

50:35.490 --> 50:37.575
Amber.

50:37.659 --> 50:39.035
Amber?

50:41.705 --> 50:44.248
Yeah, that guy deals
in Russian goods.

50:44.332 --> 50:46.625
Anything from
the homeland.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.377
Turn down
by the river.

51:26.374 --> 51:29.835
Amber's a prostitute?

51:29.920 --> 51:33.005
If the Russians used their
women instead of missiles...

51:33.090 --> 51:35.674
we'd all be wearing
furry hats right now.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.867
This is the dirtiest river
in the U.S. Did you know that?

52:01.952 --> 52:03.953
Right here in our
nation's capitoI.

52:05.413 --> 52:07.832
Nice place
to park your house.

52:14.089 --> 52:15.548
Amber?

52:42.117 --> 52:43.909
No, no.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.876
Shut up!

52:51.960 --> 52:54.211
I'm not gonna-
I'm not gonna hurt you!

52:56.131 --> 52:59.216
Bozlovski. Bozlovski. Where is he?

53:02.637 --> 53:04.388
Where is Bozlovski?

53:04.472 --> 53:06.432
I don't know who
you're talking about!

53:20.488 --> 53:21.614
Shut up!

53:34.502 --> 53:36.587
Where is Bozlovski?

53:36.671 --> 53:39.089
I will kill you here...

53:39.174 --> 53:41.592
and let you float away.
I swear to God.

53:41.676 --> 53:44.428
Please.
Please don't.

53:44.512 --> 53:45.930
Where is he?

53:46.014 --> 53:47.765
I am begging you.
I don't know.

53:47.849 --> 53:50.267
Bullshit.
That is bullshit.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.436
PauI, we broke into her place! Okay?

53:52.520 --> 53:54.313
Go back to the car
and shut up!

53:54.397 --> 53:55.648
Where is he?

53:55.732 --> 53:57.483
Please.

53:57.567 --> 54:00.653
PauI, let me
talk to her!

54:00.737 --> 54:02.279
Please.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.743
Please, I don't
know anything.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.126
You're a very
lucky girI.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.089
Come.

54:57.252 --> 55:01.171
You didn't really show her
pictures of your kids, did you?

55:01.256 --> 55:04.341
You know, they teach you a
couple tricks at Quantico.

55:04.426 --> 55:07.428
Oh, Quantico.
Good cop, bad cop.

55:10.932 --> 55:12.224
Making a connection.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.685
Oh! Very nice.

55:14.769 --> 55:16.020
Yeah?

55:47.469 --> 55:51.889
I, uh, I know
- I know this man you're looking for.

55:51.973 --> 55:54.141
Okay? You-you can
follow me there.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.519
Who are you?

55:59.856 --> 56:01.273
Her brother.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.067
Oh.

56:03.151 --> 56:06.070
Look, I take you
to where Bozlovski is.

56:06.154 --> 56:08.238
What's your name?

56:08.323 --> 56:09.615
Leo.

56:09.699 --> 56:11.450
Leo. Leo, give me
your phone.

56:11.534 --> 56:13.077
Give me your phone.

56:14.329 --> 56:16.580
There you go.

56:16.664 --> 56:20.751
Now, Leo, you didn't call anyone and
tell them we were coming, did you?

56:20.835 --> 56:24.254
No. No, no.
No, I swear.

56:24.339 --> 56:29.134
Now, if anything goes wrong, Leo,
I'm putting two bullets in her head...

56:29.219 --> 56:32.554
and I'm dumping her in the
river. Then I'm coming for you.

56:35.350 --> 56:39.561
Okay.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.748
You're gonna shoot her in the head?

57:01.751 --> 57:03.669
Just making
a connection.

57:21.604 --> 57:23.856
Okay. This is
the place.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.483
Okay, Bozlovski,
he's in there.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.569
No, no, no.
No, no, come on.

57:44.627 --> 57:46.628
Leo! Hey.

57:47.922 --> 57:49.214
How many
girls you got?

57:49.299 --> 57:52.050
Come on, tell me.
Five? Ten?

57:52.135 --> 57:55.220
Fifteen?
Talk to me. Huh?

57:56.973 --> 57:58.223
Two.

57:58.308 --> 57:59.516
What?

57:59.601 --> 58:04.021
Two.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.232
All right.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.401
You get me
to Bozlovski...

58:09.486 --> 58:11.862
you keep
your business...

58:11.946 --> 58:14.865
and we never met.
All right?

58:14.949 --> 58:19.244
You. Call for backup, or whatever
they told you to do at Quantico.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.663
You stay there by the
door. You don't leave.

58:23.166 --> 58:24.416
Go.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.043
He comes, too?

58:26.127 --> 58:28.003
No, no, he stays at the door. Go on.

58:39.349 --> 58:44.269
Perfect. Because I was first
in my class in door watching.

59:31.192 --> 59:33.485
I hear you've been
asking questions about me.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.654
You know my name.

59:35.738 --> 59:37.656
Johann.

59:41.703 --> 59:44.496
Coming in through
Mexico, smart. Very smart.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.791
How do you know this?
What agency are you with?

59:47.875 --> 59:50.586
They say you
killed a Senator.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.673
They think
you're Cassius.

59:56.718 --> 01:00:00.137
Uh-oh.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.807
What do you think?

01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:08.312
You think I'm stupid enough to
call ahead from my own phone?

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.982
You think I give a damn
what happens to some whore?

01:00:12.066 --> 01:00:15.819
Yes. I've played
Cassius before.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:20.657
If they want me to be
Cassius, I become Cassius.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.618
But you're not him.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:26.872
Really?

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.295
How can you
be so sure?

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.841
Because I'm Cassius.

01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:48.578
You were here?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.205
Yes, sir.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.628
And I ran
immediately upstairs.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:41.631
Hey. Ollie. Come on. You did the
work on the Moussali capture, right?

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.634
Applied some like theoreticaI
geography to his whereabouts?

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:46.803
Yeah, that's right.
Tracking a fugitive...

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.681
is essentially the same thing as
tracking an endangered species.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.975
You rule out the places
they can't or won't go...

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:54.186
untiI you have a reasonably
few places to look.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.021
You want in on this thing? Come on.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:00.484
So, what is it
I'm looking for?

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:04.154
Late in Cassius' career, his murders
were no longer just pro-Soviet.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.989
He was killing
Russians, too.

01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:08.492
And also English, Polish,
Czech, you name it.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.160
When was this?

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:12.662
Around 1988.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.623
It never made
any sense.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.544
I think I missed
something here.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.713
Why do you think
you missed something?

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.840
You have some
new information?

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:25.884
PauI Shepherdson.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.470
Yeah?

01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:31.640
What?

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:36.061
He's been at the company
for like 25 years!

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.522
Yeah, I know, man. That's
why I need you on this. Okay?

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:40.565
I've been over this shit
like a thousand times...

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.026
to the point at which I always
see the exact same thing.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.862
Find something different.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.701
Okay. Yeah, sure. I-

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:55.580
But if you're right, I mean,
that means the entire time...

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:59.042
he's been
hunting himself?

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:00.710
So, he killed
the Senator?

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:03.004
If we're right
about this, yeah.

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.886
Agent Geary.

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:11.763
I've got a question
about a file here.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.057
It's blue and it's got a
note attached that says...

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:15.934
"Too many questions.
Not Cassius. "

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.561
Uh, No. That one's a hoax.

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.105
It's like a crude
copycat murder.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.565
Okay, cooI.
I'll exclude it.

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:30.740
I'm gonna run for
coffee. Want something?

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.951
Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:18.788
Ooh.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.248
Jesus!

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.169
PauI! Hi!
Thank you!

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.629
You need
to be carefuI.

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.464
Yeah.
Oh, let me-

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:29.174
Stay up there.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:32.844
Okay.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.973
I want you to tell your
husband to ask off this case.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:40.477
Have him say that it's just too
much for him, for his family.

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:43.855
What-whatever he has to
say, just get him out.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.815
PauI, what do you
expect me to do?

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.026
You know, I told you. I
can't watch over him anymore.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.153
He's getting very close
to a dangerous man.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.030
He won't
listen to me.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.990
He won't listen to
anything I have to say, so-

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:56.493
He's gonna
die, Natalie!

01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:58.328
What?

01:05:58.412 --> 01:05:59.955
Do you hear me now?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.668
Cassius has
taken out men...

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.670
much more
experienced than Ben.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.839
He doesn't give a damn
about you, about your family.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.175
He will kill
your husband.

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:14.135
Like snapping
his fingers.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.399
And he will
feeI nothing.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:47.877
I pieced together the photos of every
murder and I laid them out chronologically.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:50.213
Oh, that red line
right there indicates...

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.757
where his killing became
erratic and inexplicable.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:56.386
So, all you've gotta do is set up a
null hypothesis and try and prove it.

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.723
And when you can't prove it, that means
your originaI hypothesis must be true.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:00.932
Wait, wait.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.226
Take some fact.

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:06.062
You said you believe Cassius
returns to the scene of the crimes.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.231
And you've got photos
of every murder.

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:11.109
So set up a hypothesis of, say,
Stephen Hawking is Cassius...

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:14.738
which gives you a null hypothesis
of Stephen Hawking is not Cassius.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:17.240
So, go through the photos
and try and prove the null...

01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:19.993
that Rolling Thunder
is not Cassius.

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:22.912
If you can, that means your hypothesis
is incorrect. If you can't...

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.956
then depending on
your "P" value of course...

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.625
you've statistically proven
your hypothesis must be true.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.754
Or that Stephen Hawking is Cassius.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.964
Yeah.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.801
Some of us didn't sleep our way
through Logic and Stats at Harvard.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.970
Damn, this coffee
really works.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.597
I'll be right back.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.140
Jesus Christ.

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:28.723
Hey.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:33.269
Hey. Come here,
big guy.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:35.438
He misses his daddy.

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:37.106
Yeah?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.952
Sweetie, what is it?

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.829
No, just, you know how much
I care about you guys, right?

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:56.125
Oh, God.
Yeah. I do.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.003
Ben?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.344
I just-

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.350
I- I just came home to tell you
I've got to pull an all-nighter.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.480
It's all gonna
be over soon.

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:18.815
Yeah.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.652
Ben.

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:24.445
Yeah?

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:28.533
You know,
PauI told me-

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:31.369
PauI? When were you talking to PauI?

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:35.373
Well, he came by the store today and
he told me how dangerous this all is.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:40.211
Honey. Don't listen to a
word that that guy says, okay?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.715
He's just an old man who thinks
that the war is still cold.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:47.677
Trust me. This is all
gonna be over soon.

01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.387
You promise?

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.431
Yeah. But I-I
gotta go.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.188
Natalie?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.323
It's- Never mind.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:42.065
I dug deeper into Bozlovski's
life like you asked.

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:46.277
The guy's nothing but a killing
machine. Anywhere. Anytime.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.905
He's used every single
weapon you can think of...

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:52.784
from an M-24 from 800
meters to a rusty naiI.

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:55.930
Where was he
June 1988?

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:06.774
We had him flying into Geneva
as an Irishman named Ted O'Leary.

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.945
He was there
for four days.

01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:19.787
Where are you?

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.959
Holy shit.

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.045
Bozlovski?

01:15:38.992 --> 01:15:40.535
Hm.

01:15:59.012 --> 01:16:01.055
Oh, my God.

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:05.560
Bozlovski killed
your family.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.982
So, all this time...

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.240
you were looking
for revenge.

01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:53.649
Agent Geary.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.485
Where are you?

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.654
You got my message
on your windshield.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.823
I know the truth.

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:03.492
You've been looking for Cassius
a long time, haven't you?

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.203
Yeah. And now
I've found him.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.956
It would seem so.

01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:31.520
Where is
PauI Shepherdson?

01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:35.524
Hey! You wanna keep your
business your business?

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.194
Or do you want every Fed in the
District down here up your ass?

01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:40.655
So, goddammit,
Where is he?

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:58.589
Good to go.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.883
All right,
open it up!

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:30.324
What happened?

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:36.205
Open the gate! Open
the goddamn gate! Now!

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:37.581
Come on!

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:24.086
How did I
miss it, PauI?

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.422
How did I miss it?

01:21:26.506 --> 01:21:29.592
The entire time, Cassius
was right next to me!

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:31.135
Put the gun
down, Geary!

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.137
What? I'm supposed
to trust you now?

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:37.057
Yeah. Let's talk
about trust.

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.272
Five down!
Cassius.

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:46.650
Seventy across.
Yepatb!

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.652
Eliminated.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.447
Thirty-two down.
Bolxoh.

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:53.782
Exit.

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:57.328
This is 30-year-old
Soviet code.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:00.164
So, how old were you when-when
your family came over here?

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:03.959
What were you,
about ten? Ten?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:07.296
You never had
a choice, did you?

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:09.673
So then you wrote a thesis
that couldn't be ignored.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.009
The FBI came after you.
They signed you up.

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:15.137
You even started a family.
You started a reaI family!

01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:17.222
To make it stick.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.646
You've been a double
your whole life.

01:22:47.587 --> 01:22:52.341
You cut the Senator's neck because
you knew you were the expert...

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:57.388
who could convince the Americans
it was Cassius who did it.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:03.352
An investigation
would flush Cassius out.

01:23:05.271 --> 01:23:07.982
My orders are
to kill you...

01:23:09.442 --> 01:23:11.193
and return
to Moscow.

01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.529
My plane
leaves tonight.

01:23:13.613 --> 01:23:15.572
Alone?

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.168
Then that's all
you'll ever be.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.347
Cassius.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.520
Cassius is
getting away.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.059
Hey, listen to me.

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:28.604
He's wounded.
He's cornered.

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:31.106
He's not gonna talk.
He's not gonna play fair.

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:33.442
He's not gonna
be taken alive.

01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:35.694
Right.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.451
Geary!

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.822
Come on.

01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.907
Paul?

01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:15.455
Fuck.

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:21.420
Go home.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.214
You go-

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:27.569
Check Cassius' watch.

01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:30.322
Pull the knob.

01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:37.287
That's how he did it.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.456
Explains the cut pattern.

01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:57.516
Bozlovski's the one
with the slit throat.

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.896
I heard a shot.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.568
And when I turned around,
I saw PauI going down.

01:30:10.696 --> 01:30:15.283
But not before he'd gotten
Cassius' own wire around his neck.

01:30:15.368 --> 01:30:17.828
Cassius shot PauI?

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.333
The ballistics
will prove it.

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:30.590
But not before PauI
finally got his man.

01:30:33.052 --> 01:30:34.344
That's right.

01:30:35.721 --> 01:30:37.389
Well done,
Agent Geary.

01:30:42.728 --> 01:30:45.272
You might wanna
check on that ship.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.317
Cassius was here
for a reason.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.717
What's this?

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:16.136
These came off
the boat, sir.

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:26.396
Ben!

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.484
Tell me something.

01:31:32.111 --> 01:31:34.488
Would you ever consider working for us?

01:31:36.949 --> 01:31:38.492
Excuse me, sir?

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:43.788
Think about it.
