07:37.415 --> 07:38.681
Is this on the up-and-up?

07:38.716 --> 07:39.748
Yes, sir.

07:41.152 --> 07:42.418
What are you doing?

07:42.453 --> 07:43.652
Watching your back.

07:46.190 --> 07:47.356
Oh.

07:47.391 --> 07:48.891
Uh, we have...

07:52.396 --> 07:54.063
Hello.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.565
Mr. Castle, Ms. Shipton. [Door closes]

07:56.601 --> 07:58.534
It's a pleasure to meet both of you.

07:58.569 --> 07:59.735
I'm Mason Wood.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.669
What a pleasure.

08:00.705 --> 08:02.371
I cannot even believe I'm here.

08:02.406 --> 08:03.606
This is a dream come true.

08:03.641 --> 08:05.541
That's very kind of you to say.

08:05.576 --> 08:08.811
Our society has a long and rich history,

08:08.846 --> 08:10.646
and our membership
expands every continent,

08:10.681 --> 08:11.814
save Antarctica.

08:11.849 --> 08:12.881
Not too many murders there.

08:12.917 --> 08:14.516
No. No. [Chuckles]

08:14.552 --> 08:17.319
Although,
I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship

08:17.355 --> 08:20.122
hidden in an iceberg... 2007.

08:20.157 --> 08:21.523
Now, I hate to do this,

08:21.559 --> 08:23.792
but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone.

08:23.828 --> 08:25.261
I'm sure you understand, Ms. Shipton.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.128
No.

08:27.231 --> 08:30.132
I can stay here,
if that's what you mean.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.735
Excellent. This way.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.770
Ooh.

08:36.774 --> 08:40.308
As you can see,
we have assembled a few of our members.

08:40.344 --> 08:41.342
Hi.

08:41.379 --> 08:42.244
Hi.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.679
Hi.

08:43.714 --> 08:44.580
Hi.

08:44.615 --> 08:46.382
Hi.

08:46.417 --> 08:47.883
I know you.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.252
You were at the crime scene.

08:50.288 --> 08:51.420
You're a cop.

08:51.455 --> 08:53.856
No,
but I wear the hell out of a uniform.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.224
This is Kendall Frost.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.993
She's a private detective
based out of San Francisco.

08:58.029 --> 09:00.229
I'm afraid I'm a little confused.

09:00.264 --> 09:01.964
What exactly are we doing here?

09:03.768 --> 09:06.568
Phillip Harris was a
member of our society.

09:06.604 --> 09:08.537
His death is a tragedy.

09:08.572 --> 09:12.741
But it is also an opportunity
for you or Ms. Frost.

09:12.777 --> 09:16.111
Phillip's death has left
an opening in our ranks.

09:16.147 --> 09:20.015
Whichever one of you solves
his murder will be invited in.

09:24.468 --> 09:27.130
S08E14
G.D.S.

09:27.246 --> 09:29.742
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

09:29.976 --> 09:32.307
Phillip Harris was right. [Door closes]

09:32.572 --> 09:35.305
There is a phantom serial killer
murdering people on both coasts.

09:35.346 --> 09:36.211
That's clever.

09:36.247 --> 09:37.546
Splitting up his hunting ground

09:37.581 --> 09:39.214
kept everyone from
knowing his existence.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.983
- Did the boys get any leads?
- Just one.

09:41.018 --> 09:42.484
His sister said that Phillip Harris

09:42.520 --> 09:45.087
was working undercover
at Zenith Studios.

09:45.122 --> 09:46.322
Alexis: Oh, they're the ones

09:46.357 --> 09:47.456
that ruined the <i> Nikki
Heat</i> movie franchise.

09:47.491 --> 09:51.694
Not ruined... Destroyed, terminated,

09:52.154 --> 09:55.631
extirpated, vaporized, eviscerated.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.874
Do you plan on running
through the full thesaurus?

09:58.023 --> 09:59.935
No. I think that'll about do it.

09:59.971 --> 10:01.270
Anyway, Phillip thought

10:01.305 --> 10:03.372
someone at Zenith
Studios was The Phantom.

10:03.407 --> 10:04.573
Makes sense.

10:04.608 --> 10:06.642
Plenty of people connected
with the film industry

10:06.677 --> 10:07.810
are bicoastal.

10:07.845 --> 10:09.812
Directors, producers,
cinematographers...

10:09.847 --> 10:12.581
And actors, who are all
borderline sociopaths, by the way.

10:12.616 --> 10:15.417
Don't have to tell me.
Hey, did anyone at Zenith

10:15.453 --> 10:17.386
know that Phillip was
working there undercover?

10:17.421 --> 10:18.787
Just one... Head of the studio.

10:18.823 --> 10:20.341
Ah. Let's go talk to him.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.292
Thank you.

10:23.327 --> 10:24.927
I am so going to get that spot

10:24.962 --> 10:26.762
in the Greatest Detective Society.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.497
I mean,
there's no way Kendall has access

10:28.532 --> 10:29.999
to the kind of details that I have.

10:30.034 --> 10:31.633
Oh, don't get cocky, Rick.
You haven't solved the murder yet.

10:31.669 --> 10:32.935
- Hide me.
- What?

10:32.970 --> 10:33.802
How?

10:33.838 --> 10:35.037
Rick Castle.

10:35.072 --> 10:36.805
Oh, hi, Courtney.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.140
Hey. I'm Courtney.

10:38.175 --> 10:40.743
Hayley. So, what's going on?
You guys have a beef or something?

10:40.778 --> 10:42.011
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.

10:42.046 --> 10:43.714
No. No way. We're buds.

10:43.748 --> 10:45.280
- Oh.
- Buds?

10:45.316 --> 10:46.348
Last time I saw you,

10:46.384 --> 10:47.950
you tried to run me
down with a golf cart

10:47.985 --> 10:50.185
'cause I wouldn't let you get
cast in the <i> Nikki Heat</i> movie.

10:50.221 --> 10:53.288
But what I didn't know then,
which I do now,

10:53.324 --> 10:54.690
was that your movie was gonna be

10:54.725 --> 10:57.292
quite possibly the
worst movie ever made.

10:57.328 --> 10:58.594
Not being cast in your movie

10:58.629 --> 11:00.696
was the best thing that could
have happened to my career.

11:00.731 --> 11:01.697
[Sighs]

11:01.732 --> 11:04.333
So thanks. Let's do lunch some time.

11:04.368 --> 11:05.501
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

11:05.536 --> 11:07.236
Say hi to Brandon.

11:07.271 --> 11:09.538
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?

11:09.573 --> 11:11.707
Yeah, I can believe her.
It was a terrible film.

11:11.742 --> 11:12.841
Well, that was all thanks

11:12.877 --> 11:16.111
to this really obtuse studio executive.

11:16.147 --> 11:17.346
What the hell was his name?

11:17.381 --> 11:18.414
Trevor Nigel.

11:18.449 --> 11:20.816
And you must be Richard Castle.

11:20.851 --> 11:22.317
- Yes.
- We've only ever talked on the phone.

11:22.353 --> 11:25.354
Yeah. Nice to finally put
a face to all those notes.

11:25.389 --> 11:27.556
Thank you so much for seeing
us without an appointment.

11:27.591 --> 11:29.297
Are you kidding me?

11:30.261 --> 11:32.061
This is fate. I'm serious, Rick.

11:32.096 --> 11:33.662
Your name literally just came up

11:33.697 --> 11:35.097
in our last story-development meeting.

11:35.132 --> 11:36.331
It did?

11:36.367 --> 11:37.900
Now, look, I know this studio

11:37.935 --> 11:39.735
did a poor job producing <i> Heatwave,</i>

11:39.770 --> 11:43.105
but believe me,
I fought for your vision.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.175
And now that I am running the studio,

11:46.210 --> 11:49.611
it is time to get back in
the Richard Castle business.

11:49.647 --> 11:52.081
Oh, uh, well, thank you. I'm flattered.

11:52.116 --> 11:53.715
[Cellphone chiming] But we're
not actually here about my books.

11:53.751 --> 11:55.951
We're actually looking into
the murder of Phillip Harris.

11:55.986 --> 11:57.519
Yes, I heard about that.
It was shocking.

11:57.555 --> 11:59.288
Phil was a great guy.

11:59.323 --> 12:01.523
He saved my ass a couple of years ago.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.025
Got photos of my ex

12:03.060 --> 12:05.060
having an affair with
our personal psychic.

12:05.096 --> 12:06.462
- Oh.
- Saved me millions.

12:06.497 --> 12:08.430
[Chiming continues]
So, Phillip's sister told us

12:08.466 --> 12:09.565
that you gave him permission

12:09.600 --> 12:11.133
to go undercover here at the studio.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.168
Yes. Phil said he was
working a new case.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.704
He asked for a favor.
I owed him one, so I said okay.

12:15.739 --> 12:17.005
Who was he investigating?

12:17.041 --> 12:19.308
He wanted access to Austin Elektra.

12:19.343 --> 12:20.275
The movie director?

12:20.311 --> 12:21.844
Yeah. Shooting a film over on 1.

12:21.879 --> 12:23.011
"Gladiators."

12:23.047 --> 12:25.347
It's gonna make a billion in China.

12:25.382 --> 12:26.582
Oh, h-hold on.

12:26.617 --> 12:27.850
You don't think that Austin

12:27.885 --> 12:29.351
had something to do with Phil's murder?

12:29.386 --> 12:30.652
Was Austin filming last night?

12:30.688 --> 12:31.620
He was supposed to.

12:31.655 --> 12:32.821
But for some reason,

12:32.857 --> 12:34.556
he shut down production
early and took off.

12:34.592 --> 12:35.924
About what time did he leave the lot?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.392
I heard around 11:00. Why?

12:37.428 --> 12:39.684
Giving him lots of time
to get to that cemetery.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.048
Where do we find Stage 1?

12:44.735 --> 12:47.102
You work out?

12:47.138 --> 12:49.671
[Bell ringing]

12:49.707 --> 12:52.474
Hayley: Oh, look. There's Austin.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.843
So, how do you want to play this?

12:54.879 --> 12:57.045
Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris,

12:57.081 --> 12:59.581
he's bound to be on guard,
so we can't let him know

12:59.617 --> 13:01.650
that we are looking at him as a suspect.

13:01.685 --> 13:02.784
Kendall?!

13:02.820 --> 13:05.020
Oh, she's good. [Chuckles]

13:05.055 --> 13:06.655
How did she get onto Austin so quick?

13:06.690 --> 13:08.223
We're done for.

13:08.259 --> 13:10.425
She's already got him wrapped
around her skinny, little finger.

13:10.461 --> 13:13.896
Don't say I never did anything for you.

13:13.931 --> 13:16.365
There you are, darling.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.332
Mm.

13:22.206 --> 13:24.314
So, who's our new friend?

13:26.331 --> 13:27.876
Babe, this is Austin Elektra.

13:27.912 --> 13:29.178
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:29.213 --> 13:31.213
So, I just invited your
girlfriend up to my place later.

13:31.248 --> 13:32.781
Ready to rehearse.

13:32.816 --> 13:34.683
You're more than welcome
to join if you want.

13:34.718 --> 13:36.752
Oh, that sounds naughty.

13:36.787 --> 13:38.020
I love naughty.

13:38.055 --> 13:39.785
Ready to rehearse.

13:42.726 --> 13:43.992
Got to go.

13:44.028 --> 13:45.127
See you ladies tonight.

13:45.162 --> 13:46.581
Absolutely.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.766
Are you kidding me with this?

13:50.801 --> 13:51.867
Oh, come on, sweetie.

13:51.902 --> 13:53.969
All's fair in love and
murder investigations.

13:54.004 --> 13:55.537
What, do you think this is a game?

13:55.573 --> 13:57.606
As hot as it would be
to see you two fight...

13:57.641 --> 13:58.740
Especially after that kiss...

13:58.776 --> 14:00.976
We need to work together on this.

14:01.011 --> 14:04.179
It is in all our best interests.

14:04.215 --> 14:05.814
All right. We'll work together.

14:08.652 --> 14:09.918
For now.

14:09.954 --> 14:10.919
Wow.

14:10.955 --> 14:12.120
This is actually gonna work out great.

14:12.156 --> 14:14.256
While you and Kendall
keep Austin distracted,

14:14.291 --> 14:16.792
I'll search his house for
proof that he's The Phantom.

14:16.827 --> 14:18.860
Membership in the GDS
is as good as mine.

14:18.896 --> 14:20.462
Oh, yay for you.

14:20.497 --> 14:21.830
What's wrong? [Sighs]

14:21.865 --> 14:23.799
Was it the kiss with Kendall?
Was it... Too much tongue?

14:23.834 --> 14:24.633
- N...
- Not enough tongue?

14:24.668 --> 14:25.934
N... Well, not enough.

14:25.970 --> 14:28.270
No, Kendall was right.
This is not a game.

14:28.305 --> 14:30.472
If Austin Elektra is
in fact The Phantom,

14:30.507 --> 14:33.542
then we are walking right into
the lair of a serial killer.

14:33.577 --> 14:34.776
I'm sorry.

14:34.812 --> 14:36.278
Repeat everything you said after
"not enough."

14:36.313 --> 14:37.667
Oh, God help us.

14:43.803 --> 14:44.969
[Computer beeps]

14:46.406 --> 14:47.304
Esposito: Hey, Kev.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.540
Hey! Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

14:49.787 --> 14:51.475
What's up, partner?

14:51.511 --> 14:52.743
Castle and Hayley might
be onto something.

14:52.779 --> 14:54.712
Turns out that movie
director was in New York

14:54.747 --> 14:56.347
during two of The Phantom's murders.

14:56.382 --> 14:57.214
What about the third?

14:57.250 --> 14:58.215
Based on financials,

14:58.251 --> 14:59.984
there's no indication
of where Austin was.

15:00.019 --> 15:01.085
Which means he could have been here

15:01.120 --> 15:02.520
committing that third New York homicide.

15:02.555 --> 15:03.387
This could be our guy.

15:03.423 --> 15:04.288
Yeah, I'm gonna keep digging.

15:04.323 --> 15:05.823
Oh, and, uh...

15:05.858 --> 15:07.291
[Computer beeps]

15:07.326 --> 15:08.893
What is this, bro?

15:12.860 --> 15:14.165
What are you hiding from me,

15:14.200 --> 15:16.067
and who is Tyler Ross,

15:16.102 --> 15:18.369
and why are you running a
background check on him?

15:18.404 --> 15:19.937
Tyler's nobody.

15:19.972 --> 15:22.873
Um, well, you see, um...
Okay, Jenny a-and I,

15:22.909 --> 15:24.642
we're looking to have a new nanny.

15:24.677 --> 15:26.410
Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny.

15:26.446 --> 15:27.511
[Laughs]

15:27.547 --> 15:28.412
- What?
- Yeah.

15:28.448 --> 15:29.947
[Both chuckle]

15:29.982 --> 15:31.749
Stop it.

15:31.784 --> 15:33.366
You're, like, the worst liar ever.

15:33.886 --> 15:35.020
Who is this guy?

15:35.317 --> 15:36.656
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.

15:36.855 --> 15:40.774
She wanted me to check him
out but not to tell you.

15:44.330 --> 15:45.957
You know what this means, right?

15:47.200 --> 15:52.025
We... are gonna have some
fun at Lanie's expense.

15:54.951 --> 15:56.273
Hey, Lanie.

15:56.309 --> 15:57.541
I got your text.

15:57.577 --> 15:58.809
And I've got your murder weapon...

15:58.845 --> 16:00.611
A picture of it, anyway.

16:00.646 --> 16:03.414
I used the autopsies of
The Phantom's victims

16:03.449 --> 16:05.054
to generate this.

16:06.185 --> 16:06.951
Ryan: Hmm.

16:08.758 --> 16:11.589
Those serrations near the
base are pretty distinctive.

16:11.624 --> 16:12.523
Exactly.

16:12.558 --> 16:13.624
Find the knife...

16:13.659 --> 16:15.192
Find the killer. Nice work.

16:15.228 --> 16:17.528
So, how's the background check going?

16:17.563 --> 16:19.830
Oh, pretty good so far.

16:19.866 --> 16:22.700
I don't like the sound of that.

16:22.735 --> 16:25.002
No, t-there's...
there's nothing to worry about...

16:25.037 --> 16:26.137
y-yet.

16:26.172 --> 16:27.037
It's... it's just a rumor.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.240
Let's hear it.

16:29.275 --> 16:30.941
Okay. He's got a thing about...

16:30.977 --> 16:32.176
clowns.

16:32.211 --> 16:34.478
That's okay.
Lots of people are afraid of clowns.

16:34.514 --> 16:36.280
Oh, no, no. He's not afraid of them.

16:36.315 --> 16:37.414
He likes them.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.316
Like a fetish?

16:39.352 --> 16:41.652
[Sighs] Oh, good Lord.

16:41.687 --> 16:43.254
I-I haven't verified it yet.

16:43.289 --> 16:45.322
I still have to speak
with one of his exes.

16:45.358 --> 16:47.945
Okay. Keep me posted, will you?

16:48.193 --> 16:50.060
Ryan, that is excellent. Thank you.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.864
Now, just hold off on giving
it to LAPD just until morning.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.633
We have a plan to expose
who's behind this.

16:55.668 --> 16:57.902
[Sighs] Or get ourselves killed.

16:57.937 --> 16:58.869
Having second thoughts?

16:58.905 --> 16:59.870
About having a ménage

16:59.906 --> 17:01.105
with a trophy-taking serial killer?

17:01.140 --> 17:02.840
No! What could possibly go wrong?

17:02.875 --> 17:04.441
Look, this the murder weapon.

17:04.477 --> 17:06.042
All you have to do is
distract Austin long enough

17:06.078 --> 17:08.012
for me to find this knife.

17:08.047 --> 17:10.314
Let's just hope we don't
find it in one of our backs.

17:10.348 --> 17:11.615
Right.

17:11.651 --> 17:12.849
[Alarm beeping] Oh.

17:12.885 --> 17:13.983
Castle: Wow.

17:14.020 --> 17:14.919
Ooh.

17:14.954 --> 17:16.287
Sorry.

17:16.321 --> 17:17.221
I was setting up

17:17.256 --> 17:19.190
a few counter-surveillance precautions.

17:19.224 --> 17:20.089
You think we're being bugged?

17:20.126 --> 17:21.090
[Beeping stops]

17:21.127 --> 17:22.326
We aren't sure exactly what or who

17:22.361 --> 17:23.493
we're looking for out here,

17:23.529 --> 17:25.930
so I figured,
we can't be sure who's looking for us.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.031
So, what tripped the alarm?

17:27.066 --> 17:29.500
Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.

17:29.535 --> 17:32.369
[Beeps, whirring]

17:32.405 --> 17:34.605
[Beeping] Ah, ha ha ha.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.674
I'll be damned.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.008
Looks like this watch
is good for something

17:38.044 --> 17:40.477
other than taking care of
checks at Korean restaurants.

17:40.513 --> 17:41.345
Mm.

17:42.448 --> 17:44.782
[Sighs]

17:44.817 --> 17:46.717
Hello.

17:46.752 --> 17:48.919
Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter

17:48.955 --> 17:50.187
to the watch's battery.

17:50.223 --> 17:51.388
You think it's CIA,

17:51.424 --> 17:53.157
left over from my Thailand mission?

17:53.192 --> 17:54.959
Possible.
Doubt we'll ever know for sure.

17:54.994 --> 17:56.627
Can't we track down
where it was purchased?

17:56.662 --> 17:59.463
No. I'm afraid this
transmitter's incredibly common,

17:59.498 --> 18:01.298
which makes tracking
it almost impossible.

18:01.334 --> 18:02.866
But we have to try, right?

18:02.902 --> 18:04.467
I mean, it's why we're here.
[Knock on door]

18:05.605 --> 18:06.604
Kendall. Wow.

18:06.639 --> 18:08.405
You certainly have baited the hook.

18:08.441 --> 18:09.306
I had to,

18:09.342 --> 18:10.241
especially considering

18:10.276 --> 18:12.843
it's gonna be two against one tonight.

18:12.878 --> 18:14.478
What are you talking about?

18:14.513 --> 18:15.946
Come on, Rick.

18:15.982 --> 18:18.482
I know you're gonna sneak into
Austin's house to look for evidence

18:18.517 --> 18:19.850
while Hayley and I distract him.

18:19.885 --> 18:22.019
I'm no fool, but <i> you</i> are if you think

18:22.054 --> 18:25.656
your little plan will
work without these.

18:25.691 --> 18:27.291
Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.

18:27.326 --> 18:28.392
Where'd you get those?

18:28.427 --> 18:29.994
Don't worry your pretty,
little head about that.

18:30.029 --> 18:31.462
Pretty?

18:31.497 --> 18:33.597
While Hayley and I distract Austin,

18:33.633 --> 18:35.633
you need to look for this.

18:35.668 --> 18:37.234
It's a false wall.

18:37.270 --> 18:39.270
A secret room.

18:39.305 --> 18:41.038
That would be the perfect
place for Austin to hide

18:41.073 --> 18:42.706
the grisly trophies he
takes from his victims.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.241
Exactly.

18:44.277 --> 18:48.245
Now, if you find evidence
that Austin is the killer,

18:48.281 --> 18:49.713
I get equal credit.

18:49.749 --> 18:51.181
No double-crosses.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.516
Deal.

18:52.551 --> 18:54.318
That way,
Mason Wood has to make both of us

18:54.353 --> 18:55.286
members of the society.

18:55.321 --> 18:56.720
Let's go.

18:56.756 --> 18:58.155
Hold on. Is that what you're wearing?

18:58.190 --> 18:59.723
- Yes.
- No.

18:59.759 --> 19:00.824
Deciding between something I brought

19:00.860 --> 19:02.393
and something that
Rick's about to buy me.

19:02.428 --> 19:04.395
I think I know the direction
you'll be leaning in.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.829
Oh.

19:05.865 --> 19:08.832
You really do deserve to be in
the Greatest Detective Society.

19:11.437 --> 19:13.437
Austin: Wow.

19:13.472 --> 19:15.906
Come in, come in.

19:15.941 --> 19:17.675
Let's get some drinks in you.

19:27.420 --> 19:28.585
Ooh.

19:31.424 --> 19:33.023
Here you go.

19:33.059 --> 19:34.124
Ooh.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.793
A little something to
loosen your inhibitions.

19:35.828 --> 19:38.195
Oh, don't worry.
We're plenty loose already.

19:38.230 --> 19:39.897
Not after I've tied you up.

19:40.900 --> 19:41.980
Oh.

19:44.203 --> 19:45.803
So, who's first?

19:45.838 --> 19:47.404
Uh...

19:47.440 --> 19:50.240
[Chuckles]

20:02.088 --> 20:03.954
Um...

20:03.989 --> 20:05.022
tell you what.

20:05.057 --> 20:08.959
Uh,
why don't you let me tie you up first?

20:08.994 --> 20:10.294
Then how am I gonna be able to do

20:10.329 --> 20:12.196
all the terrible things that
I've got planned for you?

20:12.231 --> 20:14.765
[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.834
[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?

20:16.869 --> 20:18.035
Kendall... Kendall?

20:18.070 --> 20:18.869
Damn it.

20:18.904 --> 20:20.404
She's gonna miss all the fun.

20:26.278 --> 20:29.113
[Grunts]

20:29.148 --> 20:30.748
You've been had.

20:30.783 --> 20:32.850
That dirty little...

20:43.596 --> 20:45.596
[Chuckles]

20:45.631 --> 20:47.097
I'm getting tired of chasing you.

20:47.133 --> 20:49.700
Well, there's no rule
against taking a short break.

20:49.735 --> 20:51.068
[Laughs]

20:51.103 --> 20:53.103
[Alarm blaring]

20:53.139 --> 20:54.532
What the hell?

20:56.976 --> 20:58.375
Hey, where's your friend?

20:59.178 --> 21:00.176
Huh?

21:03.749 --> 21:06.049
Castle: Thought we had a deal.

21:06.085 --> 21:07.584
No more double-crosses.

21:07.620 --> 21:10.220
Sorry, Ricky,
but I am going to be the one

21:10.256 --> 21:12.089
to take those trophies in.

21:13.926 --> 21:14.925
Castle: Well, good luck with that,

21:14.960 --> 21:16.427
because I'm looking for a murder weapon.

21:16.462 --> 21:17.594
It's a unique blade,

21:17.630 --> 21:18.962
but I guess you wouldn't know that.

21:18.998 --> 21:21.098
- You're lying.
- No.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.167
And here it is.

21:23.202 --> 21:24.601
Okay, great.

21:24.637 --> 21:25.669
We'll take it in together.

21:25.704 --> 21:27.671
Like you said, we have deal, right?

21:27.706 --> 21:28.872
Oh, so now the deal's back on?

21:28.908 --> 21:30.207
Austin: Drop the knife!

21:32.244 --> 21:34.511
Austin, the police know we're here.

21:34.547 --> 21:36.814
If you kill us, they will catch you.

21:36.849 --> 21:38.081
I'm not gonna kill you.

21:38.117 --> 21:39.450
Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?

21:39.485 --> 21:40.617
Because you're robbing me?

21:40.653 --> 21:41.919
We're not robbing you.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.887
We're getting evidence that
you are a serial killer.

21:43.923 --> 21:45.389
Like this knife, which as been used

21:45.424 --> 21:47.491
in seven ritualistic murders.

21:47.526 --> 21:48.559
What are you talking about?

21:48.594 --> 21:50.894
I-I'm not a serial killer.
I'm a film director.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.697
And that is a prop from a horror
movie I shot two years ago.

21:53.732 --> 21:54.932
Well, prop or not,

21:54.967 --> 21:56.967
this knife matches our victims'
wounds exactly.

21:57.937 --> 22:01.305
There were five identical
knives made for that film,

22:01.340 --> 22:03.941
which means there are four
others out there just like it.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.642
Maybe you should be
looking for one of those.

22:05.678 --> 22:08.145
But you were in New York
for three of those murders.

22:08.180 --> 22:10.747
So were 8 million other people,
including my assistant,

22:10.783 --> 22:13.650
who can prove my
whereabouts at all times.

22:13.686 --> 22:15.619
Now get the hell out of my house!

22:18.224 --> 22:18.989
- Do you think you could...
- Hey.

22:19.024 --> 22:20.357
Okay.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.494
Well,
the director was telling the truth.

22:23.529 --> 22:25.496
His alibis check out for
all three New York murders.

22:25.531 --> 22:26.663
Then we need to track down

22:26.699 --> 22:28.265
all the knives that were
made for that horror movie.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.333
Yeah. Clearly one of them

22:29.368 --> 22:31.301
was used to commit all seven murders.

22:31.337 --> 22:32.402
There were eight.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.770
W-What are you talking about?

22:33.806 --> 22:35.672
I discovered a fourth New York victim...

22:35.708 --> 22:37.484
A man by the name of Pat Crews.

22:38.277 --> 22:39.376
Are you sure?

22:39.411 --> 22:41.411
Phillip Harris only knew about three.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.347
There's a reason he missed this one.

22:43.382 --> 22:45.415
Because this murder took place

22:45.451 --> 22:48.452
on the same day The Phantom
killed a woman in Los Angeles.

22:48.487 --> 22:49.885
But how can that be?

22:50.689 --> 22:51.622
Unless...

22:51.657 --> 22:53.824
There are two serial killers,

22:53.859 --> 22:55.477
one on each coast.

22:58.747 --> 23:00.347
[Knock on door]

23:00.382 --> 23:01.728
- [Groans] Who is that?
- Castle: I don't know.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.570
Whoever it is,
I hope they brought coffee.

23:04.325 --> 23:05.367
Detective Menendez.

23:05.450 --> 23:06.442
- You know...
- Please come in.

23:06.508 --> 23:08.526
I expect to be screwed over
by an asshat that I don't know,

23:08.923 --> 23:10.557
but not from one who's
supposed to be my friend.

23:10.593 --> 23:11.925
I take it that you heard
about what happened

23:11.961 --> 23:13.394
at Austin Elektra's house last night.

23:13.429 --> 23:14.561
You said you'd keep me in the loop.

23:14.597 --> 23:15.863
Look, we can explain.

23:15.898 --> 23:19.533
Uh, Austin had a prop knife
that matched the murder weapon.

23:19.568 --> 23:21.402
And our lab tested it this morning...
it's clean.

23:21.437 --> 23:22.469
Did you manage to track down

23:22.505 --> 23:23.704
the other four knives used in the movie?

23:23.739 --> 23:25.539
Two of the knives are still
at the studio warehouse.

23:25.574 --> 23:26.540
They came up clean, too.

23:26.575 --> 23:27.841
And according to the prop master...

23:27.877 --> 23:30.224
Who alibied out, by the way...

23:30.340 --> 23:31.478
The last two knives went missing.

23:31.514 --> 23:33.647
Well, Lanie discovered there
are two different murderers

23:33.682 --> 23:36.483
operating on either coast
using identical weapons.

23:36.519 --> 23:37.618
All we have to do...

23:37.653 --> 23:38.719
Oh, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

23:38.754 --> 23:41.722
T-there is no "we." You two are done.

23:41.757 --> 23:43.924
And if I catch either of
you working this case,

23:43.959 --> 23:46.430
I'll have you both
arrested for obstruction.

23:48.264 --> 23:50.030
No, no, no, no. Mm.

23:50.065 --> 23:54.668
Hey, maybe a little single malt
scotch will smooth things over?

23:54.703 --> 23:56.603
Go home.

23:56.639 --> 23:58.505
Excuse me.

23:58.541 --> 24:00.741
T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle.

24:00.776 --> 24:03.544
Oh. Um... thanks.

24:08.584 --> 24:09.883
Looks like Menendez isn't the only one

24:09.919 --> 24:11.785
unhappy about last night.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.854
Mason wants to see
Kendall and me right away.

24:13.889 --> 24:15.355
Good luck.

24:17.626 --> 24:18.892
What's that?

24:18.928 --> 24:20.994
This is payback.

24:22.398 --> 24:24.631
Thanks for coming in.

24:24.667 --> 24:25.833
Where is everyone else?

24:25.868 --> 24:29.102
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned

24:29.138 --> 24:32.005
after the way you conducted
yourselves last night.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.609
It was messy, boarish,
lacking the sophistication

24:35.644 --> 24:37.945
we expect from any potential member.

24:37.980 --> 24:39.179
- It was her fault.
- It was his fault.

24:39.215 --> 24:42.149
No, it was my fault,

24:42.184 --> 24:43.617
thinking that either of you

24:43.652 --> 24:45.586
could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.

24:45.621 --> 24:47.788
Mr. Wood, please.
Give me another chance.

24:47.823 --> 24:49.790
No, give me another chance.

24:49.825 --> 24:51.225
I will find Phillip's killer.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.560
She won't. She's been two steps
behind me this whole time.

24:53.596 --> 24:54.862
Behind you?

24:54.897 --> 24:56.129
I got to Austin first.

24:56.165 --> 24:57.331
And I got to the knife.

24:57.366 --> 24:59.299
And although it wasn't
the actual murder weapon,

24:59.335 --> 25:01.602
thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,

25:01.637 --> 25:04.471
I have the address to the prop
master's cousin in San Pedro

25:04.507 --> 25:06.507
who kept two of the last
prop knives for himself

25:06.542 --> 25:07.908
as souvenirs.

25:07.943 --> 25:10.377
You see? I <i> am</i> close.

25:12.581 --> 25:14.248
Okay.

25:14.283 --> 25:15.849
And may the best detective win.

25:15.885 --> 25:17.618
Don't worry. I will.

25:22.558 --> 25:24.057
You realize she picked your pocket.

25:24.093 --> 25:25.092
Oh, yes.

25:25.127 --> 25:27.294
Whose address is on that piece of paper?

25:27.329 --> 25:28.295
It's a casting director

25:28.330 --> 25:29.463
my mother wanted to have a meeting with.

25:29.498 --> 25:30.631
Hmm.

25:30.666 --> 25:33.567
Kendall is going to be
mad when she finds out.

25:33.602 --> 25:34.835
Like I'm scared of her.

25:34.870 --> 25:37.237
She is a master of Krav Maga.

25:38.248 --> 25:42.414
And she is deadly with a sniper
rifle from a mile and a half.

25:43.579 --> 25:44.911
Good luck.

25:46.282 --> 25:47.481
I could not sleep last night.

25:47.516 --> 25:48.549
I kept having nightmares

25:48.584 --> 25:50.083
that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown.

25:50.119 --> 25:51.919
Please tell me you found out more.

25:51.954 --> 25:55.255
Okay, relax. I spoke with Tyler's ex.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.823
He does not have a clown fetish.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.225
[Sighs]

25:58.260 --> 26:00.594
[Exhales] But...

26:00.629 --> 26:01.891
But what?

26:02.932 --> 26:05.332
But what, Ryan? You better speak now.

26:05.367 --> 26:09.870
His ex mentioned that he might
have a bit of a bad habit.

26:09.905 --> 26:10.837
What kind of habit?

26:10.873 --> 26:13.273
The kind that requires rubber sheets.

26:13.309 --> 26:14.541
He's a bed wetter?

26:14.577 --> 26:16.310
Yo.

26:16.345 --> 26:17.778
Detective Menendez just called.

26:17.813 --> 26:19.913
According to the prop master,
those two knives went missing

26:19.949 --> 26:21.014
on the last day of the shoot.

26:21.050 --> 26:21.815
Ohh.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.283
He's got the studio

26:23.319 --> 26:24.885
pulling drive-on logs from that day.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.286
He's gonna send us over a copy

26:26.322 --> 26:27.754
so we can see if any of the names

26:27.790 --> 26:31.158
connect to one of the New York murders.

26:31.193 --> 26:33.026
Hey, you okay?

26:33.062 --> 26:34.027
[Chuckles]

26:34.063 --> 26:37.297
Damn, what'd you tell her?

26:37.333 --> 26:38.765
Bed wetter. [Laughs]

26:40.193 --> 26:42.402
[Sighs]

26:42.438 --> 26:44.237
This had better be important.

26:44.273 --> 26:45.272
The masseuse was in the middle

26:45.307 --> 26:47.040
of doing things one only dreams of.

26:47.076 --> 26:49.209
I was able to trace the
tracker in my dad's watch.

26:49.244 --> 26:51.311
It was purchased by a
man named Malcolm McCabe.

26:51.347 --> 26:52.613
Oh.

26:52.648 --> 26:54.414
Born and raised in L.A.

26:54.450 --> 26:55.916
Former Army Special Forces.

26:55.951 --> 26:57.851
Says here he's working overseas.

26:57.886 --> 26:59.620
He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.

26:59.655 --> 27:01.388
We should go talk to her,
see if she knows anything.

27:01.423 --> 27:02.522
Sure, we could do that.

27:02.558 --> 27:04.758
Or we could just pretend
you never found this.

27:04.793 --> 27:06.526
Fine.

27:06.562 --> 27:07.461
But my dad wants to know

27:07.496 --> 27:08.962
what happened during his missing time.

27:08.998 --> 27:10.597
Of course he does.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.032
But what happens when your father starts

27:12.067 --> 27:14.468
poking his nose into
this Malcolm fellow?

27:14.503 --> 27:15.535
Hmm?

27:15.571 --> 27:18.071
I mean,
the guy is former Special Forces.

27:18.107 --> 27:20.907
God only knows what he's
doing for a living right now.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.043
Isn't is safer for your father

27:23.078 --> 27:25.178
to maybe not remember what happened?

27:26.382 --> 27:28.382
You should delete this.

27:33.989 --> 27:35.088
You okay?

27:36.525 --> 27:38.759
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

27:38.794 --> 27:41.528
Why don't you head back to the spa?

27:41.563 --> 27:43.030
Don't have to tell me twice.

27:43.065 --> 27:44.865
[Sighs]

27:45.634 --> 27:48.335
[Door opens, closes]

27:52.207 --> 27:53.273
Check this out.

27:53.308 --> 27:55.142
I compared the drive-on
list from the studio

27:55.177 --> 27:56.243
to people connected

27:56.278 --> 27:58.078
to the fourth New York victim,
Pat Crews.

27:58.113 --> 27:59.246
- Any matches?
- Yeah.

27:59.281 --> 28:01.281
Crews was a writing
teacher at The New School.

28:01.316 --> 28:02.482
One of his early students

28:02.518 --> 28:04.818
is a successful screenwriter
named Jordan Keegan,

28:04.853 --> 28:05.986
who now lives in New York

28:06.021 --> 28:07.788
but happened to be on
the studio lot in L.A.

28:07.823 --> 28:08.989
when the murder weapons went missing.

28:09.024 --> 28:10.700
Let's pick his ass up.

28:11.130 --> 28:15.095
So, you're doing a news story
on my nephew Malcolm, huh?

28:15.130 --> 28:17.064
Mm-hmm. It's about war heroes.

28:17.099 --> 28:17.864
Oh.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.499
Look. Isn't he handsome?

28:19.535 --> 28:20.567
Oh, yeah.

28:20.602 --> 28:23.036
But like I said,
he's out of the country.

28:23.072 --> 28:24.738
His job keeps him really busy.

28:24.773 --> 28:26.707
Let me get you his number, okay?

28:26.742 --> 28:28.875
- Thanks.
- Be right back.

28:43.826 --> 28:47.327
Uh, Ms. McCabe, I have to go.

28:47.362 --> 28:49.796
Thank you for your time.

28:54.636 --> 28:56.103
[Gasps]

28:57.673 --> 29:00.307
Damn it, Alexis.
You're just like your old man.

29:00.342 --> 29:02.509
You can't leave things alone.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.844
Are you going to kill me?

29:08.926 --> 29:10.119
What?

29:11.473 --> 29:12.822
Why would you say that?

29:12.857 --> 29:14.090
Oh, I don't know.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.326
Maybe because you're connected
to my dad's missing time

29:16.361 --> 29:18.361
and now you're hiding in
the back of my rental car.

29:18.396 --> 29:21.531
Alexis, I would never hurt you.

29:21.566 --> 29:22.699
This isn't what you think.

29:22.734 --> 29:24.304
What the hell is your game, Hayley?

29:24.601 --> 29:26.369
Believe me, you don't want to know.

29:26.404 --> 29:27.670
Neither does your father.

29:27.706 --> 29:29.264
Why not?

29:30.942 --> 29:32.769
It's complicated.

29:36.948 --> 29:39.515
Jordan Keegan? We need to talk.

29:39.551 --> 29:40.717
About what?

29:40.752 --> 29:43.319
Well, your name came up in a homicide.

29:43.355 --> 29:44.988
This is the murder weapon.

29:45.023 --> 29:46.889
It's a prop from a movie that you wrote.

29:46.925 --> 29:48.024
So?

29:48.059 --> 29:49.525
So, did you happen to
keep one as a souvenir?

29:49.561 --> 29:50.827
Perhaps two?

29:50.862 --> 29:53.029
One for yourself,
one for your partner out in Los Angeles?

29:53.064 --> 29:54.397
What are you guys talking about?

29:54.432 --> 29:56.399
We're talking about Pat Crews,
your old writing teacher.

29:56.434 --> 29:58.781
He was killed with a knife
shaped exactly like that one.

29:59.337 --> 30:00.517
Hey!

30:07.579 --> 30:08.611
Drop it!

30:08.646 --> 30:09.579
Help me!

30:09.614 --> 30:11.047
- Let her go, Jordan.
- Stand back!

30:11.082 --> 30:12.749
You got no where to go.
Drop the scissors.

30:12.784 --> 30:14.150
Listen, fellas, I'm a writer,

30:14.185 --> 30:16.986
so trust me when I say if
the villain surrenders,

30:17.022 --> 30:19.122
oh, it's just so unsatisfying!

30:19.157 --> 30:21.299
That's why they always go out in style.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.993
Just relax, Jordan.

30:24.029 --> 30:25.128
Don't do anything stupid.

30:25.163 --> 30:26.462
Stupid? Me?

30:26.498 --> 30:29.665
How can you say that when
we've outsmarted you for years?

30:29.701 --> 30:31.601
Who's "we"? Who's your partner in L.A.?

30:31.636 --> 30:33.236
A genius.

30:33.271 --> 30:36.172
He believed in me.
Took my visions, made them real.

30:36.207 --> 30:36.973
Give us a name, Jordan.

30:37.008 --> 30:38.608
You'll never find him.

30:38.643 --> 30:39.509
Ah!

30:39.544 --> 30:40.543
[Gunshots fire]

30:41.413 --> 30:43.579
[Sobbing]

30:48.920 --> 30:51.187
Okay. No, I understand. Thank you.

30:51.222 --> 30:52.588
Hey. [Door closes]

30:52.624 --> 30:53.990
That was Ryan and Esposito.

30:54.025 --> 30:55.458
They had to kill Jordan Keegan.

30:55.493 --> 30:58.461
But they sent us digital
copies of Jordan's computer.

30:58.496 --> 31:00.496
Now, I think we...
and by "we", I mean the two of you...

31:00.532 --> 31:02.098
Might be able to find something on there

31:02.133 --> 31:04.567
that'll give us a lead to find
his West Coast counterpart.

31:04.602 --> 31:06.669
Rick, we need to talk.

31:06.704 --> 31:08.281
About what?

31:08.529 --> 31:10.840
I'll give you two the room.

31:15.213 --> 31:16.212
[Door closes]

31:16.247 --> 31:17.814
You remember when we first met?

31:17.849 --> 31:18.748
How could I forget?

31:18.783 --> 31:20.416
You sucker-punched me in the face.

31:20.452 --> 31:23.515
No. No, we'd met before that.

31:23.845 --> 31:25.688
A year and a half earlier,
to be precise.

31:27.896 --> 31:30.326
You mean this whole time you knew?

31:30.361 --> 31:31.828
Who the hell are you?

31:31.863 --> 31:34.931
I'm Hayley. Didn't lie about that.

31:34.966 --> 31:36.265
Technically,
I didn't lie about anything.

31:36.301 --> 31:40.069
I misrepresented, sure,
but I-I didn't lie.

31:40.105 --> 31:41.471
But why?

31:41.506 --> 31:43.673
Because a year and a half ago,
you asked me to.

31:43.708 --> 31:44.874
In fact, you begged.

31:44.909 --> 31:46.042
I don't understand.

31:46.077 --> 31:49.579
So ages ago,
I did some freelance work for MI-6,

31:49.614 --> 31:52.248
and I met an American spy on an op.

31:52.283 --> 31:55.551
He was an older gentleman,
very handsome, smart as a whip.

31:55.587 --> 31:56.486
My father.

31:56.521 --> 31:58.087
Jackson Hunt.

31:58.123 --> 31:59.589
Year and a half ago, he calls me,

31:59.624 --> 32:02.758
asks me to keep an eye
out on you here in L.A.

32:02.794 --> 32:04.694
Said you were sticking your
nose where it didn't belong.

32:04.729 --> 32:05.895
What did he say I was doing?

32:05.930 --> 32:07.530
[Sighs] I didn't ask, he didn't say.

32:07.565 --> 32:10.199
But I do know that after
your two weeks in Thailand,

32:10.301 --> 32:12.201
your undercover mission
for the CIA was over

32:12.237 --> 32:13.403
and you were supposed to go home.

32:13.438 --> 32:15.505
But instead you went
rogue and you came to L.A.

32:15.540 --> 32:16.739
To keep tabs on you,

32:16.775 --> 32:19.108
I borrowed a GPS tracker from
a friend of mine, Malcolm.

32:19.144 --> 32:19.909
And I placed it...

32:19.944 --> 32:21.411
In my watch. That was you.

32:21.446 --> 32:23.813
Yeah, only you left it in
that Korean restaurant.

32:23.848 --> 32:25.048
So I lost track of you.

32:25.083 --> 32:28.151
And by the time I found you,
you'd been shot in the side.

32:28.186 --> 32:28.951
Who shot me?

32:28.987 --> 32:30.286
You wouldn't say.

32:32.824 --> 32:36.059
You did mention your CIA handler,

32:36.094 --> 32:37.593
a guy named Jenkins.

32:37.629 --> 32:39.829
You said that you were
going to go and ask him

32:39.864 --> 32:41.831
to erase everything that
had happened to you here.

32:41.866 --> 32:43.533
But that doesn't sound like me.

32:43.568 --> 32:47.036
I'm curious by nature.
Why would I do that?

32:47.072 --> 32:49.305
I have no clue, but you were adamant.

32:49.340 --> 32:52.041
And you made me promise that
if I ever met you again,

32:52.077 --> 32:53.176
I'd never say any of this.

32:54.979 --> 32:57.280
Well, that doesn't explain
why you stuck around,

32:57.315 --> 32:59.916
why you agreed to come work with me.

33:01.719 --> 33:06.956
I'm fond of you, Rick,
and I adore your daughter.

33:06.991 --> 33:11.828
And after a lifetime of caring
about nobody but myself,

33:11.863 --> 33:15.898
I decided to stick around
and keep an eye on you two.

33:22.325 --> 33:25.775
It's like a Philip K. Dick novel.

33:25.810 --> 33:27.343
Wish I could go back in time

33:27.378 --> 33:31.314
and tell myself not to erase my memory.

33:31.349 --> 33:34.650
Or you could trust that you
did it with good reason.

33:34.686 --> 33:38.321
Maybe just let your lost time go,

33:38.356 --> 33:39.622
because if you keep looking,

33:39.657 --> 33:43.860
if you keep searching for that answer,
well...

33:43.895 --> 33:46.481
there's no telling what
kind of hell you'll unleash.

33:50.734 --> 33:51.866
Dad?

33:51.902 --> 33:53.501
What did Hayley tell you?

33:54.219 --> 33:55.703
The truth.

33:55.739 --> 33:57.038
Why did Hayley lie to us?

33:57.073 --> 33:59.174
Because I asked her to.

33:59.209 --> 34:01.910
It's complicated.

34:01.945 --> 34:03.044
Can you trust her?

34:03.079 --> 34:05.213
Yes. Absolutely.

34:05.248 --> 34:06.548
And you can, too.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.882
But you can't trust <i> me</i> with the truth?

34:07.918 --> 34:09.384
Oh, hang on.

34:09.418 --> 34:11.460
Alexis, that's not about trust.

34:12.255 --> 34:14.188
I am your father.

34:14.224 --> 34:16.391
And from the day you
came into this world,

34:16.426 --> 34:19.561
it's been my job to protect you.

34:19.596 --> 34:20.995
[Sighs]

34:22.958 --> 34:24.431
So, what's our next move?

34:24.467 --> 34:26.065
There is no next move.

34:26.414 --> 34:28.969
We let sleeping dogs lie.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.109
It's safer that way, for everyone.

34:36.279 --> 34:39.981
I'm really sorry to interrupt,
but I think I found something.

34:40.016 --> 34:41.382
- On Phillip's homicide?
- Yeah.

34:41.418 --> 34:44.152
I was going through Jordan
Keegan's computer files,

34:44.187 --> 34:46.735
and I found something interesting.

34:47.591 --> 34:48.556
It's a screenplay.

34:48.592 --> 34:49.424
Mm.

34:49.458 --> 34:50.725
"Gemini Killers."

34:50.760 --> 34:53.895
Yeah, it's a dreadful story
about a serial-killing duo.

34:53.929 --> 34:56.731
Not sure,
but it might give us some insight.

34:56.766 --> 34:57.932
I've seen this before.

34:57.968 --> 34:59.167
The script?

34:59.202 --> 35:01.135
No, the...
the notes in the margins here...

35:01.171 --> 35:02.934
This odd handwriting that...

35:04.774 --> 35:06.207
I know who the killer is.

35:07.110 --> 35:08.743
No, I cannot hold. I...

35:08.778 --> 35:10.979
[Siren chirping] It's Trevor Nigel.

35:11.014 --> 35:12.780
What... You're gonna have to move that.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.382
Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest.

35:14.417 --> 35:15.683
Excuse me?

35:15.719 --> 35:17.185
We found the knife that
killed Phillip Harris.

35:17.220 --> 35:20.145
Along with a rather ghastly
collection of human body parts.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.724
I admit nothing.

35:22.759 --> 35:24.259
Neither did your partner
before he was killed.

35:24.294 --> 35:25.793
Jordan is dead?

35:25.829 --> 35:27.161
He gave me up, didn't he?

35:27.197 --> 35:30.198
I knew I should never have
partnered with a screenwriter.

35:30.233 --> 35:32.066
No, Trevor. You gave yourself up.

35:32.102 --> 35:33.668
Back when your studio
was doing <i> Heatwave,</i>

35:33.703 --> 35:36.638
I gave you notes on that
horrible script you commissioned.

35:36.673 --> 35:38.540
But you sent it back to
me with a handwritten note

35:38.575 --> 35:39.908
detailing why my ideas were stupid.

35:39.943 --> 35:41.609
I never forget a bad review,

35:41.645 --> 35:43.611
especially one with such
distinctive handwriting.

35:43.647 --> 35:44.746
Hayley: It's the same handwriting

35:44.781 --> 35:46.481
on your serial killer
partner's screenplay.

35:46.516 --> 35:49.017
Richard, you're a pretty good writer,

35:49.052 --> 35:50.985
but you should really
read Jordan's work,

35:51.021 --> 35:53.187
because it is inspiring.

35:53.223 --> 35:54.856
After I read his
"Gemini Killers" screenplay,

35:54.891 --> 35:56.758
I knew that I had found
a kindred spirit...

35:56.793 --> 35:59.394
Someone with the same desires as I had.

35:59.429 --> 36:00.895
And his script laid out...

36:00.931 --> 36:02.564
[Handcuffs clicks]
the perfect plan for us to kill...

36:02.599 --> 36:06.267
Ow!... Without attracting suspicion.

36:06.303 --> 36:07.835
Sadly, he could never nail the end.

36:07.871 --> 36:09.203
Well, we did, and you've reached it.

36:09.239 --> 36:11.306
Maybe you should do the rewrite.

36:11.341 --> 36:12.540
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.

36:12.576 --> 36:13.641
Know what? I'm good.

36:13.677 --> 36:14.842
Besides, I think your next picture's

36:14.878 --> 36:16.110
gonna be a prison drama.

36:16.146 --> 36:17.979
- Hey, still pissed at me?
- Yep.

36:18.014 --> 36:19.681
Oh, come on.

36:19.716 --> 36:21.549
I'll make it up to you
the next time I'm in town.

36:21.585 --> 36:22.650
You better.

36:22.686 --> 36:23.785
[Doors close, engine starts]

36:23.820 --> 36:24.786
That was really cute.

36:24.821 --> 36:25.954
Oh, stop it.

36:25.989 --> 36:28.590
Kendall.

36:28.625 --> 36:31.092
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?

36:31.127 --> 36:32.260
Wasn't too much traffic, was there?

36:32.295 --> 36:34.596
What freeway did you take?

36:34.631 --> 36:36.239
Well played, Castle.

36:37.834 --> 36:41.169
You beat me, unfair and square.

36:42.539 --> 36:43.705
All right.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.773
Let's get this over with.

36:49.646 --> 36:52.146
Where is she?
Her text said it was important.

36:52.182 --> 36:53.014
I don't know.

36:53.049 --> 36:55.016
- Let's go, then.
- Yeah.

37:00.023 --> 37:02.023
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:02.058 --> 37:03.524
Hey! What'd you do that for?

37:03.560 --> 37:06.194
I confronted Tyler
about his bed-wetting.

37:06.229 --> 37:08.029
[Laughs]

37:08.064 --> 37:10.398
Hey, hey, hey! Look, we're sorry, okay?

37:10.433 --> 37:12.233
It's far from okay.

37:12.268 --> 37:13.935
We broke up.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.073
Well, we'll talk to him.
We'll work it out.

37:15.140 --> 37:17.238
- Yeah.
- No, I broke up with him.

37:17.273 --> 37:18.940
After he denied being a bed wetter,

37:18.975 --> 37:21.743
he admitted to having a fetish for...

37:21.778 --> 37:23.511
Ooh, let's just say it was nasty.

37:23.546 --> 37:24.812
What do you mean, "nasty"?

37:24.848 --> 37:28.303
Yeah, what kind of nasty
things was this dude into?

37:30.221 --> 37:32.057
Get out of my morgue!

37:32.189 --> 37:33.488
Losers!

37:33.523 --> 37:36.224
The competition has ended.

37:36.259 --> 37:40.328
Richard Castle, you have solved
the murder of Phillip Harris.

37:40.363 --> 37:42.764
[Applause]

37:42.799 --> 37:44.699
Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:44.734 --> 37:45.767
You're too kind.

37:45.802 --> 37:47.468
You have proven yourself worthy,

37:47.504 --> 37:51.272
and we, the members of the
Greatest Detective Society,

37:51.307 --> 37:53.423
offer you a place at our table.

37:53.588 --> 37:55.009
I'm humbled and flattered,

37:55.045 --> 37:57.545
but I'm afraid I must decline.

37:57.580 --> 37:58.546
What?

37:58.581 --> 38:00.515
What are you doing?

38:00.550 --> 38:02.283
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

38:02.318 --> 38:05.119
to work with the best of the best.

38:05.155 --> 38:06.487
Not for me.

38:06.523 --> 38:09.724
I already work with the
greatest detective in the world,

38:09.759 --> 38:13.027
and I cannot wait to
get back home to her.

38:13.063 --> 38:16.831
But, sir, you should seriously
consider Kendall for membership.

38:16.866 --> 38:18.466
She is one hell of a detective

38:18.501 --> 38:22.470
and sneaky in all the right ways.

38:22.505 --> 38:24.005
You're sure about this?

38:24.040 --> 38:25.840
Absolutely, sir.

38:30.218 --> 38:35.183
You just keep getting more and
more interesting, Mr. Castle.

38:35.218 --> 38:37.118
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

38:48.934 --> 38:50.554
Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.

38:51.728 --> 38:53.835
Are you not packed?

38:53.870 --> 38:54.836
I can't do it.

38:54.871 --> 38:56.137
Pack you clothes?

38:56.172 --> 38:57.438
Walk away.

38:57.474 --> 39:00.212
Hayley,
I need to know what happened to me.

39:01.478 --> 39:02.877
Okay, there's one last thing.

39:02.912 --> 39:05.580
Just before you left to
get your memories erased,

39:05.615 --> 39:07.782
you came to me with one final request.

39:07.817 --> 39:09.117
Like what kind of request?

39:09.152 --> 39:11.937
That if you demanded to know the truth,

39:12.201 --> 39:14.186
I show you this.

39:16.126 --> 39:17.158
What is this?

39:17.193 --> 39:19.927
It's a, uh,
secret website on the dark web.

39:19.963 --> 39:20.728
What's on it?

39:20.764 --> 39:21.863
Not a clue.

39:21.898 --> 39:23.231
You installed a password
that only you would know.

39:23.266 --> 39:24.900
Called it "Blair's combination."

39:25.668 --> 39:28.269
From a short story I
wrote when I was 17.

39:28.304 --> 39:29.670
Never saw the light of day.

39:29.706 --> 39:31.645
What was that combination?

39:34.410 --> 39:36.344
4 left...

39:36.379 --> 39:38.079
17 right...

39:38.114 --> 39:39.247
21 left.

39:39.282 --> 39:40.615
[Beeps]

39:43.453 --> 39:44.519
I'll step out.

39:44.554 --> 39:45.987
No, no. You've, um...

39:46.022 --> 39:48.051
You've earned the right to see this.

39:50.828 --> 39:53.161
<i>Hey, there, buddy. It's me.</i>

39:53.196 --> 39:54.662
<i>And by "me," I mean you.</i>

39:54.697 --> 39:57.665
<i>And if you are seeing this,
then you are an idiot,</i>

39:57.700 --> 39:59.667
<i>because you are trying to figure out</i>

39:59.702 --> 40:01.702
<i>what happened to you in Los Angeles.</i>

40:01.738 --> 40:03.671
<i>What you discovered</i>

40:03.706 --> 40:05.673
<i>about Bracken's partnership with LokSat</i>

40:05.708 --> 40:07.008
<i>is too dangerous to pursue.</i>

40:07.043 --> 40:08.976
LokSat?

40:09.012 --> 40:10.478
I <i> knew</i> about LokSat?

40:10.513 --> 40:12.446
<i>I am barely living proof.</i>

40:12.482 --> 40:14.549
<i>I was shot trying to figure out</i>

40:14.584 --> 40:16.617
<i>where LokSat's plane
was landing tonight.</i>

40:16.653 --> 40:19.153
<i>I barely escaped without
being identified.</i>

40:19.189 --> 40:24.292
<i>I am erasing our mind for a reason...</i>

40:24.327 --> 40:26.448
<i>To protect Kate.</i>

40:26.961 --> 40:31.766
<i>'Cause if she found out,
then she will die.</i>

40:33.636 --> 40:37.405
<i>So do not tell her what you
discovered in Los Angeles,</i>

40:37.440 --> 40:38.573
<i>for her sake.</i>

40:38.608 --> 40:40.208
Do you know what this means?

40:40.243 --> 40:42.476
Yes. You tracked LokSat.

40:42.512 --> 40:44.245
If we can cross-reference airports

40:44.280 --> 40:47.048
and identify what airplane
landed the night you were shot,

40:47.083 --> 40:49.250
then we have a real chance

40:49.285 --> 40:51.018
of finding out who LokSat really is.

40:51.054 --> 40:52.286
No, no.

40:52.322 --> 40:55.857
It means what happened was my fault.

40:58.494 --> 41:03.197
The murders of Beckett's
former AG team...

41:03.233 --> 41:05.132
In trying to protect
Beckett from LokSat,

41:05.168 --> 41:07.582
I inadvertently sentenced
them all to death.
