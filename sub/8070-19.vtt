Hey, look who's here.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.009
Hey.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.178
Knocked off early.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.813
I thought I'd do something
special for myself.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.649
New thermos.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.185
Ooh, plaid.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.086
Snazzy.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.290
I wanna knock off early, too.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.391
Can you cover for me?

00:23.491 --> 00:24.725
Oh, no problem.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.626
Cool.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.128
Hey, I've got the afternoon off.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.329
We'll do something together.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.563
I know.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.565
We'll go grocery shopping.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.167
I'll go in there and
buy the groceries,

00:33.267 --> 00:37.105
and you can sit out in the
car and play the radio.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.140
Quality time.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.741
See you later, Bonnie.

Bye.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.950
Roseanne.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.020
Don't you think it might be
appropriate to, say, uh, check

00:53.121 --> 00:56.457
with the boss before
simply taking off?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.159
Well, you know, it's dead
in here and everything,

00:58.259 --> 00:59.693
Bonnie says she
could cover for me.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.594
What's the problem?

01:08.169 --> 01:11.372
The problem is that
you keep doing this.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.740
You took yesterday morning off.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.741
You didn't tell me.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.809
Last Saturday, Estelle
covered for you.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.878
Estelle tells me that.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.013
I set the schedule
around here, Roseanne,

01:20.114 --> 01:22.683
and you're ignoring it,
which makes me wonder

01:22.783 --> 01:24.852
if you really want this job.

01:24.952 --> 01:25.819
Of course I do.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.423

80 degrees when we

02:22.009 --> 02:23.076
get to Las Vegas this weekend.

Oh, I can't wait.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.047
Hey, check this
out-- these really

02:27.147 --> 02:29.750
cool sunglasses I bought.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.951
What do you need those for?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.420
You know you're never
going to leave the casino.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.422
Well, they're to cover
my eyes when I'm bluffing.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.429
You can't bluff
a slot machine.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.630
I don't see why not.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.432
You talk to the dice.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.200
Honey, slots don't pay.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.735
You gotta let me teach
you how to shoot craps.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.102
No, I don't like that.

are at the buffet table.

Well anyways, I don't
care nothing about gambling,

03:09.457 --> 03:10.424
to tell you the truth.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.193
All is I want to do
is see Wayne Newton.

Oh yeah, the Main Wayne,

03:18.399 --> 03:20.100
Remember when we
saw him in Chicago

03:20.200 --> 03:25.506
and he was singing that, ah,
Appleblossom Time just to me?

03:25.606 --> 03:29.042
Thought he was singing to me.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.511
Dream on.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.479
Hey.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.713
Hey.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.615
Now, I don't want you
guys living on pizza

03:34.715 --> 03:36.083

I went out and bought

03:36.183 --> 03:36.984
you this nice ravioli.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.790
Thanks.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.025
So, what time are you
guys leaving tomorrow?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.794
Since I get off work.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.863
So, that'd be,
what, like, 5 o'clock?

what, quarter to 6:00?

04:03.311 --> 04:05.479
I think that's about right.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.315
Well, you know, you guys
got to allow yourself plenty

04:07.415 --> 04:09.116
of time to get to the airport.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.419
Well, that's a
great idea, honey.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.070
Thanks for bringing me
that suitcase, Crystal.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.406
Crystal, you shouldn't be
hauling around that big bag

04:32.506 --> 04:33.374
in your condition.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.309
Well, there's
nothing in it, Dan.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.044
I just brought it over
because Roseanne asked

04:37.144 --> 04:38.312
to borrow it for your trip.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.514
Here, sit down.

Oh, he's just wonderful
like that, Crystal.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.556
You know, when I was
pregnant with Darlene,

04:48.656 --> 04:51.392
he was so nice to me I
held her in for 16 months.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.329

04:55.429 --> 04:56.430
Hi.

you when we're gone.

I'll take good care
of him, Roseanne.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.103
Why can't I stay home
with Becky and Darlene?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.872
Because I don't want you
to spend the whole weekend

05:04.972 --> 05:06.907
locked up in a closet.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.543
Roseanne, here's $5.00.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.412
I want you to put it in one
of those slot machines that

05:11.512 --> 05:13.313
has the million dollar jackpot.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.848
And if it wins a
million dollars, stop.

05:17.851 --> 05:23.023
Well, I'm up $5.00, Dan, and
you said the slots don't pay.

what, every 15, 16 years?

relate to each other

05:35.436 --> 05:38.071
as a man and a woman.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.743
Yeah, then right after that
I'm going to go shoot craps.

another five minutes.

the number of the hotel,

just in case there's a problem.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.659
Dad, we're not babies.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.993
You don't have to
worry about us.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.930
I'm not worried about you,
I'm worried about the house.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.700
So.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.769
What time's the party start?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.704
What are you talking about?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.440
Girls, listen.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.576
When I was your age, and my
parents went out of town,

06:15.676 --> 06:18.011
I had a party.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.012
I had a great party.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.850
Legendary.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.853
People wrote songs about it.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.188
So, did your parents
know you had it?

06:28.288 --> 06:29.857
Of course not.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.925
Then we're not having a party.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.727
I know.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.529
Hey, guy, hi.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.564

06:36.664 --> 06:38.466
Uh, DJ, Aunt Jackie's here.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.934
OK, Dan, what time do you
want me over here tonight?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.135
Jackie's coming over?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.103
Why?

06:43.203 --> 06:44.171
It's still a big secret.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.109
Oh, that's cute!

06:49.209 --> 06:50.944
We're not having a party.

06:51.044 --> 06:51.979
Why won't you believe us?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.914
Dan, I've got a great idea.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.315
Since I'm coming
over tonight anyway,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.317

with the girls, how about

06:57.417 --> 06:59.520
I wear my old cop uniform?

Sure!

a party or anything.

Oh, man, I'm late.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.247

07:27.347 --> 07:28.616
Oh, wait, Roseanne?

07:28.716 --> 07:29.950
Look, here's $2.00.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.520
Take it to the roulette table
and put it on number 17.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.555
Just let it ride until I lose.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.523
What's the point?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.557
I love the action.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.862
OK, see you later.
Bye.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.463
- See you tomorrow, Roseanne.
- Tuesday.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.698
Tuesday?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.601
Oh, no, we're in the middle
of a big weekend sale,

07:47.701 --> 07:49.637
and I have you on the schedule.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
I told you about
this weeks ago.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.405
No, ma'am.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.108
I wasn't here weeks ago.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.979
Well, I told
some guy in a suit.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.181
That suit doesn't
work here anymore.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.315
And he didn't take care of it.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.818
No, you are working tomorrow.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.386
I'm going to Vegas.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.356
How am I going to
replace you on no notice?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.158
I have had this trip
planned for months.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.627

plane tickets.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.995
Aw.

08:15.095 --> 08:20.934
Oh, well that falls into the
category of not my problem.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.502
Give me a break.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.271
No, Roseanne, you
give me a break.

08:24.371 --> 08:27.174
You just come and go
here as you please.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.375
You totally ignore me.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.543
So is that what this is about?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.178
Because I'm not
nice enough to you?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.213
I'm running a business.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.516
And I need a waitress
tomorrow, so let's just say

08:36.617 --> 08:39.119
either you're here
to work your shift,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.121
or don't come back at all.

08:44.124 --> 08:53.033
[music playing]

08:53.133 --> 08:54.167
The money's spent.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.936
If we don't get on the
plane, we're out $500.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.105
So, do you think I should go?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.608
Roseanne, we've been
saving for this trip forever.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.809
I know that.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.577
If we leave right now,
we drive the speed limit,

09:03.677 --> 09:06.346
we'll just miss the plane.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.449
Well, I gotta talk
about this some more now.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.718
OK, talk.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.320
OK, now, I know you think
this is some waitress job,

09:13.420 --> 09:14.988
but I really like it, you know?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.591
And I like Bonnie, and I
like being in the mall too.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.592
And, I mean--

09:18.692 --> 09:20.761
OK, Leon, he's a
piece of garbage,

09:20.861 --> 09:22.796
but if I had to quit
that job, then I have

09:22.896 --> 09:24.097
to go look for another job.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.533
I could end up with a boss
that's even worse than that.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.434
Crazy world, isn't it?

09:27.534 --> 09:30.437
OK, let's go.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.039
Boy, you really care
about this, don't you?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.473
Roseanne, I've worked
hard for this trip,

09:33.573 --> 09:34.407
and I don't want to miss it.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.643
Now, are you gonna
sit on the couch

09:35.743 --> 09:37.244
and bellyache over nothing,
or are we going to go

09:37.344 --> 09:38.378
and have a wonderful time?

09:38.478 --> 09:39.512
Oh, well, OK.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.649
We'll go and have
a wonderful time.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.284
But you're going to regret it.

[rock music playing]

09:56.263 --> 09:58.565
JACKIE: No, no, no.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.169
No.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.070
No.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.772
Party's down here.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.439
I just wanted to
use the bathroom.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.540
Well, tough.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.380
Uh-- let me see that.

10:18.151 --> 10:18.952
Carry on.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.563
Hi.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.432
Hi, how are you doing?

10:32.532 --> 10:33.667
Nice party.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.603
Yeah, well, I'm
enjoying myself.

10:36.704 --> 10:40.674
You know, you have
got a beautiful smile.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.910
I'm not smiling.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.012
Well, why don't
we work on that?

10:45.112 --> 10:48.315
Ho ho ho ho, God.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.850
Hey, there we go!

10:49.950 --> 10:51.551
Uh.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.585
I'm Eric.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.586
I'm a senior.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.688
Oh.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.789
And you are?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.157
I'm Jackie.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.759
I'm a former senior.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.629
Jackie.
Jackie.

11:02.730 --> 11:06.366
You know, that is
a beautiful name.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.768
Jackie, you know,
these parties, they

11:07.868 --> 11:11.171
make it real hard for two people
to get to know each other well.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.439
I got a car.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.341
Why don't we go somewhere?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.608
Listen, Eric.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.644
You are very cute.

11:17.745 --> 11:21.815
But you and I together
would be illegal.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.953
So, I don't think so.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.420
Hey, OK, it's cool.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.125
Yep.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.326
Ooh, yeah.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.661
Still got it.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.900
Look, I tried to get her out.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.001
The old broad said no.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.475
Yeah, thanks anyway.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.478
[music playing]

11:51.578 --> 11:54.982
[chatter]

11:57.584 --> 11:58.451
Hey, Becky?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.953
Hey, Brian.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.389
Um, if I--

12:02.489 --> 12:04.792
well-- can I ask you a
question without you,

12:04.892 --> 12:06.760
like, telling Darlene
that I asked you?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.861
Yeah.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.430
Well, you know what
happened with us, right?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.834
Yeah, you made out on the
couch, and then you groped her.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.937
Yeah, she made me.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.138
Yeah, so?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.507
Well-- I asked her to
go with me, you know,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.509
exclusively, and she said no.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.811
I don't get it.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.080
Well, Darlene's just sort
of discovering boys, Brian.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.349
In fact, till she met you,
she thought she was one.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.121
So I should be her
boyfriend, right?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.789
Becky, there you are.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.125
I was looking for you.

12:38.225 --> 12:41.594
Brian, can you excuse us?

12:41.694 --> 12:42.729
Where you been, Beck?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.331
Around.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.099
Around where?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.400
Outside.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.735
With Mark?

12:48.836 --> 12:50.838
Look, I was going to tell
you, but I couldn't find you.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.941
Oh, OK.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.608
You're not going to
tell Mom and Dad, are you?

12:55.708 --> 12:56.576
No.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.045
You're so cool.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.179
Well, not really.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.848
See, your folks figured
he'd probably show up,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.516
and they told me it was all
right, as long as I was here.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.153
You're kidding.
He just drove away.

13:06.253 --> 13:11.892
Oh-- I was going to tell
you, but I couldn't find you.

13:11.992 --> 13:12.792
Hey, Darlene.

13:12.893 --> 13:13.693
Barry's here.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.761
No way.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.296
He's such a scuzz.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.165
If he came here to drool
all over you all night,

13:18.265 --> 13:21.534
I swear I'll kill him.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.436
Hi, Darlene.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.373
Hi, Barry.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.875
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.010
Look, Barry, I don't
think this is a good idea.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.545
I mean, Darlene liked
you, and you asked me out,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.181
and she's real
vulnerable right now.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.783
And I don't think she should
have to go through this again.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.685
Shut up, Becky.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.187
What did you wanna
talk about, Barry?

13:44.091 --> 13:46.593
Uh, look, I never really
did apologize for what--

13:46.693 --> 13:47.928
What for?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.829
I mean, you like Becky
more than you like me,

13:49.930 --> 13:52.065
so you asked her out.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.200
Right?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.969
Well, it wasn't that
I like Becky, exactly.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.337
It's just that she's
kind of popular,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.639
and I got this idea that
maybe I had a chance with her.

13:59.739 --> 14:04.577
So it's kind of like, you
know, go for the gold.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.646
Becky's gold?

14:06.746 --> 14:07.814
So, what am I?
- Darlene--

14:07.915 --> 14:11.952
Well, come on, Barry!
Pick a mineral.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.253
You're funny, Darlene.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.587
Yeah, I'm a regular riot.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.555
No.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.789
It's what's great about you.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.860
I mean, that's why I like you.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.096
You like me?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.397
Hey!
You leave her alone.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.298
Who are you?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.399
I'm her boyfriend.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.867
Boyfriend?

14:27.968 --> 14:28.768
Oh, well, we had a thing.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.638
It's over.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.373
Yeah, well, it was fine
until you came along.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.274
Hey, don't push me.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.308
You mean like this?

14:35.408 --> 14:36.209
No, I mean like this.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.048
Jeez, Darlene, who is this guy?

14:41.148 --> 14:43.951
[chatter]

14:44.051 --> 14:45.385
Let me through.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.419
Let me through.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.354
Hey!
Come on!

14:47.454 --> 14:48.255
You guys!

14:48.355 --> 14:49.222
You guys!

14:49.322 --> 14:50.190
Come on!

14:50.290 --> 14:51.824
What's going on here?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.293
Well, I'm sitting
here talking to Darlene,

14:53.393 --> 14:54.694
and this guy comes barging in--

14:54.794 --> 14:55.595
Well, I am her boyfriend.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.829
That's not what she says.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.765
Any more trouble out of
you two, you're outta here.

14:58.865 --> 14:59.967
I mean it.

15:00.067 --> 15:00.867
Come on.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.369
They were fighting over you?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.040
Yeah.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.641
That's it, show's over.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.243
Nothing more to see.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.812
Come on.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.683
And as for you,
Darlene, excellent.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.657
[music playing]

15:26.193 --> 15:28.128
PLANE CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM):
This is your captain speaking.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.497
Once again, I'd like to
apologize for the delay,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.499
but the snow is coming
down pretty hard now,

15:32.599 --> 15:33.866
and we're still
waiting for clearance

15:33.967 --> 15:35.335
from the tower, which
hopefully, we'll

15:35.435 --> 15:36.769
be getting any minute now.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.172
So in the meantime, why don't
you all just sit back, relax,

15:39.272 --> 15:41.508
and, uh, wait.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.310
Seven.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.211
Seven.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.317
Eight, eight's a point, and--

15:50.417 --> 15:52.619
eight or from Decatur,
get this plane to Vegas.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.590
Well, these
peanuts are no good.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.825
I didn't grow 'em, dear.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.161
And these seats
are too small, too.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.230
I didn't build
the plane, dear.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.598
It's never gonna
stop snowing, is it?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.400
My fault.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.603
Stop acting like everything
I'm saying is your fault.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.504
Sorry.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.676
No, I'm sorry.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.311
I've been blaming
you the whole time,

16:18.411 --> 16:21.481
and it stopped being
fun an hour ago.

16:21.581 --> 16:25.385
Well, if it'll You feel
any better, I'm up $56,000.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.622
If we were in Vegas right
now, I could quit my job, too.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.923
I really like that job, Dan.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.126
I mean, I know it wasn't
a career or nothing,

16:33.226 --> 16:35.428
but I was happy, and
I hate losing it.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.729
I know.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.731
I'm sorry I pushed you.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.634
I just thought you'd feel
better once you found yourself

16:41.734 --> 16:43.736
on an overcrowded,
uncomfortable little plane that

16:43.836 --> 16:44.937
won't go anywhere.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.776
You know, maybe you won't
have to lose that job.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.312
I mean, once we get back from
Vegas, you can go to the mall

16:52.412 --> 16:53.446
and talk to the guy.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.881
Take a shot.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.782
I'll be, like, groveling.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.950
You want me to talk to him?

16:58.051 --> 17:01.321
No, I think I'd better
fight my own battles.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.390
We're gonna go
see Wayne Newton.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.126
Yeah, I bet we get
some lousy seats, too.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.062
Nah, I'll make sure we get us
seats right down in the front.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.263
Yeah?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.898
Close enough for me to hit
him with my underpants?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.803
You will take them off
first, won't you, dear?

17:19.672 --> 17:22.509
I ain't making no promises.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.277
PLANE CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM):
Ladies and gentlemen--

17:24.377 --> 17:25.678
All right, all right.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.513
PLANE CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM):
This is Captain Johnson again.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.680
We just heard from the tower.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.416
The snow's getting
real bad out there,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.017
so they are presently
trying to determine

17:31.118 --> 17:32.452
whether we can take off at all.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.420
Sorry about that.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.454
We'll know in just a moment.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.622
Hang in there.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.056
We're going to make it.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.491
No way.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.826
Look at it out there.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.162
This plane ain't going nowhere.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.764
Yeah, I got $50 says it is.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.166
I'll take five of that.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.700
- Dan.
- Honey, I'm on a roll.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.602
You're on, bud.
- Hey, I'll take $10.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.837
You're on.
You got it.

17:50.937 --> 17:51.838
- I got it for $15.
- You got it.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.106
- I'm going double, pal.
- Outstanding.

17:53.206 --> 17:53.973
PLANE CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM):
Ladies and Gentlemen--

17:54.073 --> 17:55.242
Shh.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.009
PLANE CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM):
This is Captain Johnson.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.146
Uh, I'd like to bet $100
we're not going anywhere.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.453
He's bluffing.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.921
[music playing]

18:20.867 --> 18:22.569
Iced tea, coffee.

18:22.669 --> 18:23.770
I had the coffee.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.406
I don't care.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.740
All right, you
know what you want?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.409
Oh, are there
any specials today?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.478
No.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.513
Well, is there anything
you could recommend?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.648
Yeah, hurry.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.916
I guess I'll
have the tuna melt.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.185
Good choice.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.085
Oh, excuse me.

18:39.186 --> 18:39.986
What?

18:40.086 --> 18:41.254
I forgot to order a beverage.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.855
Well, then, you
must be really kicking

18:42.955 --> 18:46.826
yourself right about now, huh?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.060
Hi, Bonnie.

18:48.161 --> 18:48.961
Oh, hi, Roseanne.

18:49.061 --> 18:49.862
What are you doing here?

18:49.962 --> 18:50.930
I thought you were in Las Vegas.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.166
Well, the flight
got canceled, so we

18:53.266 --> 18:54.667
had to spend the
night in Chicago,

18:54.767 --> 18:56.736
and then it took us half
a day to drive back here.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.277
Well, well, well.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.146
Look who came crawling back.

OK.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.758
This is not easy.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.893
But, uh-- if you don't
give me my job back,

19:20.993 --> 19:24.764
my husband's going to
beat the crap out of you.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.566
Roseanne.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.135
We both know why you're here.

say, I want my job back.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.776

I was going to.

But you're here, begging
for your job, so--

19:42.982 --> 19:43.783
I'm not begging.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.917
Oh, of course not.

No, you have your, uh--
