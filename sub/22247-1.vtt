[beeping]

01:04.647 --> 01:08.943
[engine roaring]

01:10.195 --> 01:11.946
This is Galra cruiser beta-nine.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.657
We are within range
and requesting permission to dock.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.201
[over comm] Proceed.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.666
[beeping]

01:35.094 --> 01:37.096
[over PA]
A priority-one shipment is en route.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.349
 Activate the docking station immediately.

01:43.394 --> 01:47.857
I can't believe we're stuck here.
This base predates the Zaipirium Siege.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.527
It's amazing
this equipment remains operational.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.863
We're lucky to have it since the rebels
overran the Sigma-3 Quadrant.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.617
-It's all we have left in this system.
-[powering on]

02:11.965 --> 02:13.925
[suspenseful music playing]

02:18.888 --> 02:20.098
We destroyed the Komar.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.184
How are the Galra still producing
such vast amounts of quintessence?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.187
Find out where it's coming from
and where it's going.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.856
Get a reading on that shipment.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.277
Remember, this is purely
intelligence gathering. Do not engage.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.245
[snoring]

03:02.891 --> 03:03.933
[sighs]

03:16.446 --> 03:18.781
Impossible. It's overloading my monitor.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.409
I've never seen
these kinds of readings before.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.792
The op is compromised. Abort!

03:29.918 --> 03:32.170
[over comm]
Extraction point in two doboshes.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.379
 This is a hard out.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.800

-[panting]

03:53.775 --> 03:55.068
[panting]

03:56.486 --> 03:59.113
-He's not back?
-He's got 30 ticks.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.409
Begin preparations for takeoff.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.912
[powering on]

04:09.123 --> 04:10.458
[beeping]

04:14.879 --> 04:17.005
[grunting]

04:24.806 --> 04:29.769
-[sighs] Will he be all right?
-You broke protocol.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.105
I had to.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.607
You didn't consider that something
could've happened to you.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.859
That would make two men down
instead of one.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.445
Every member
of the Blade of Marmora understands

04:39.570 --> 04:42.031
that the mission is more important
than the individual.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.952
-This isn't Voltron.
-I understand that.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.997
In Voltron, we would've gone back in
to save Regris.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.125
I went back to save the mission.
Regris had the intel.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.586
Getting him and it back on the ship
was worth the risk.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.562
Keith, good, you're back.
The team's on a mission.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.981
You need to get to your lion
and join them immediately.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.443
I will, but I think we just discovered
a new form of quintessence.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.821
The readings are off the charts.
Kolivan says it could be linked to Lotor.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.489
Okay, we'll discuss it when you return.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.908
The team's escorting refugees out
of the Fimm System.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.454
This is Lotor I'm talking about.
He hasn't been seen in months.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.289
This might be our chance
to track him down.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.958
I said, we'll discuss it later.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.377
Right now, I need you
to focus on the mission at hand.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.463
-But--
-This isn't a request, Keith.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.049
Get to the Fimm System. That's an order.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.146
[growling]

05:59.609 --> 06:01.527
Well, look who decided to show up.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.905
Yeah, are you even taking this seriously?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.490
Sorry I'm late.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.123
Were you able to speak with Kolivan
about the intel?

06:14.248 --> 06:17.710
I did, and we need to find out
all we can about that quintessence.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.546
But more importantly,
Voltron needs a strong leader.

06:20.671 --> 06:26.094
-I know they do and it should be you.
-Keith, we've discussed this before.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.805
Besides, we both know
that the Black Lion has chosen you.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.182
You only tried once.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.519
You had a connection with the Black Lion
and I know it's still there.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.897
-If you just give it another shot--
-Keith, we all have a part to play.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.565
This is mine now.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.734
I've come to terms with that.
Now, you need to.

06:43.861 --> 06:47.323
I support your decision
to continue with your Marmora training...

06:47.448 --> 06:49.826
but not at the expense of the team.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.788
They need you, Keith.
They need you to be their leader.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.669
Okay, everybody,
today, we'll be heading to Reiphod,

06:59.794 --> 07:02.547
a planet recently liberated
from Galra forces.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.384
This is embarrassing. We're basically
the grand marshal of a parade.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.803
Not a parade. A show of arms!

07:08.928 --> 07:10.012
Whatever it is,

07:10.138 --> 07:12.890
this is the second one of these
we've done just this week.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.184
I know it's not exactly
battling the Galra,

07:15.309 --> 07:19.147
but believe it or not, this helps us
boost morale and strengthen alliances.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.691
Right, right, strongholds,
blah-dy, blah-dy, blah.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.819
Now, I say we go over
our lion choreography one more time.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.447
I don't want a repeat
of what happened last time, Hunk.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.031
I thought my lion had more room.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.452
Shiro, my apologies for interrupting,
but this is an urgent matter.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.078
A Galra supply ship has been spotted

07:34.203 --> 07:36.372
passing through
Quadrant Omega-Raylar-Six.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.333
What's it doing so far
from the normal supply routes?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
We can't be certain,
but taken together with the fact

07:41.878 --> 07:43.921
that Lotor hasn't been seen
in quite some time

07:44.046 --> 07:46.340
and the emergence
of this new form of quintessence,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.176
we feel compelled to investigate.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.637
Normally, we would wait for better intel,
but I believe we should act on this now.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.806
I'll send Voltron to intercept.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.267
An infiltration mission makes more sense.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.645
We can plant a tracker and see
just how far the supply route extends.

07:59.770 --> 08:03.608
With all the Galra activity as of late,
my agents are spread thin.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.528
-Not anymore. Count me in.
-Hey, what about our performance?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.406
We can't razzle-dazzle the crowd
with just four lions.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.576
This mission is more important
than a show of arms.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.454
-Shiro?
-How long will it take?

08:16.579 --> 08:21.292
Not long, but we must act fast,
or we risk the ship jumping to hyperspace.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.004
Go. But when you're done,
meet us on Reiphod.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.674
[Coran] Citizens of Reiphod,

08:28.799 --> 08:31.677
 on this day, we honor you
for your perseverance.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.679
Your refusal to bow down
in the face of such adversity

08:34.804 --> 08:37.975
is a testament to the fighting spirit
of your people.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.393
You've put aside your differences

08:39.519 --> 08:42.522
and united to dispel
the oppressive Galra regime,

08:42.647 --> 08:44.941
bringing freedom to all!

08:45.066 --> 08:47.276
[crowd cheering]

08:49.612 --> 08:51.280
We thank you for joining the coalition

08:51.405 --> 08:53.824
and continuing the fight
against the Galra

08:53.950 --> 08:58.704
that began with the reemergence
of the five Lions of Voltron.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.712
Right, uh... four lions.
[chuckles]

09:07.630 --> 09:11.342
I thought Keith said he was gonna be here.
He's going to ruin our show!

09:11.467 --> 09:14.011
Lance, this isn't just about
putting on a good show.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.806
It's about uniting people
and bringing them to the coalition

09:16.931 --> 09:18.891
to help in the fight against Zarkon.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.562
[sighs]
Fine. I don't even know why I try.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.495
Triangulate positions around the ship.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.004
[grunts]

09:56.095 --> 09:58.097
Not detecting any biorhythms.

09:58.222 --> 10:02.101
Could be a crew of sentries.
Let's get in and find out.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.564
I completed the sentry scan.
There are none on board.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.525
The entire place is empty.
Have you ever seen this before?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.112
Something's not right here.
We should leave.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.989
We came all this way.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.200
We should at least plant the tracker
and find out where this ship ends up.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.827
Let's make it quick.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.412
[rapid beeping]

10:24.206 --> 10:27.376
-I'll check the logs.
-Planting the tracker.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.299
I'm locked out of the system.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.636
-It's rigged to blow!
-The ship's a decoy! Everyone out!

10:37.678 --> 10:39.263
Attempting to override.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.016
[grunting]

10:42.141 --> 10:46.062
-There's not enough time! Come on!
-Just a few more ticks.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.356
[grunting]

10:48.481 --> 10:49.815
Regris, no!

10:53.569 --> 10:55.529
[Coran] By joining the Voltron Alliance,

10:55.655 --> 10:58.574
you are joining up
with the Defenders of the Universe,

10:58.699 --> 11:04.413
who will do whatever it takes to spread
peace and freedom to every galaxy.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.750
-Hello? Kolivan?
-[static on communicator]

11:07.875 --> 11:10.169
[air hissing]

11:14.173 --> 11:15.341
Anyone?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.719
[grunts]
Communicator must be broken.

11:21.389 --> 11:25.518
[grunting]

11:31.315 --> 11:33.109
[crowd cheering]

11:35.653 --> 11:38.239
They're loving us! Razzle-dazzle!

11:47.456 --> 11:49.458
-[breathing heavily]
-[beeping]

11:53.712 --> 11:55.172
The ship.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.345
[grunts]

12:18.404 --> 12:19.447
[groans]

12:19.572 --> 12:24.076
-[breathing heavily]
-[door opens]

12:30.207 --> 12:31.167
[crowd cheering]

12:31.292 --> 12:34.420
And just as Voltron has shown
what can be done

12:34.545 --> 12:37.423
when five individuals
combine their powers together,

12:37.548 --> 12:41.886
so, too, can we combine our powers
with those on Planet Reiphod

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
and grow ever stronger.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.475
For it is the individual willing
to take up arms

12:47.600 --> 12:49.351
that strengthens the whole.

12:49.477 --> 12:53.105
And with that strength,
we will be unstoppable!

12:53.772 --> 12:55.858
[to himself]
And cue Voltron with the sword...

12:55.983 --> 12:57.568
-[cheering stops]
-[clapping]

12:57.693 --> 12:59.111
[coughing]

13:00.237 --> 13:03.866
Oh, quiznak, only four lions!
I keep forgetting that.

13:03.991 --> 13:09.205
Uh, well, when he's together,
he's like a big man. Like this.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.833
But you have to imagine it with a sword
and a big laser cannon.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.085
[imitates gunfire]

13:15.211 --> 13:20.841
Look out, Zarkon! I'm Voltron,
and I'm the biggest, baddest robot around!

13:20.966 --> 13:23.260
No, he doesn't actually talk like that,

13:23.385 --> 13:26.263
but I-- that's what
I imagined him saying if he did.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.108
Allura, I know you're mad at me,
but I'm not in the mood for a lecture.

13:39.235 --> 13:43.280
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
I heard what happened on your mission.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.908
Thanks.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.495
I know how important the work
you've been doing with the Blades is.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.121
They are incredible allies

13:51.247 --> 13:53.832
and have been instrumental
in our victories over the Galra.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.752
And while the news
of a new quintessence supply line

13:56.877 --> 13:58.379
is deeply troubling,

13:58.504 --> 14:01.340
-I cannot help but feel--
-I said I didn't want a lecture.

14:03.259 --> 14:08.013
Keith, since our battle with Zarkon,
we've been able to bolster our forces

14:08.138 --> 14:12.351
by uniting those previously ruled
by the Galra under a common symbol,

14:12.476 --> 14:13.936
Voltron.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.105
It's so much more than a weapon.

14:16.230 --> 14:20.776
It's become a symbol of freedom and hope
for the oppressed to rally around.

14:20.901 --> 14:25.531
I suppose what I'm trying to say is,
the Marmora can go on without you.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.242
They have for thousands of years.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.411
Voltron cannot.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.955
We cannot.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.106
The fact that the Galra
are using decoy ships proves

14:59.231 --> 15:01.066
that there is something larger going on.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.861
We've been tracking shipments
of this new quintessence.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.738
It's running along
a previously unknown route,

15:05.821 --> 15:07.531
which we partially identified here.

15:08.741 --> 15:13.078
We believe the next stop could be
in the Karthan-Sigma Quadrant.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.540
Keith, you'll need to get
onto the ship undetected

15:16.665 --> 15:18.500
and set a series of explosives.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.380
[beeping]

15:32.932 --> 15:33.766
[gasps]

15:57.665 --> 16:00.709
[suspenseful music playing]

16:05.547 --> 16:09.134
Prince Lotor, High Priestess Haggar
requires your presence.

16:09.259 --> 16:13.973
Lotor, while you distance yourself
from central command,

16:14.098 --> 16:18.644
rebel forces have taken
entire star systems from our hands.

16:18.769 --> 16:23.732
You think clutching on to worthless
outposts strengthens our empire?

16:23.857 --> 16:27.903
Your father knew those outposts
would one day become strongholds.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.865
My father is on his deathbed
and I'm in control.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.160
You say you rule, yet you stay hidden.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.705
An emperor must be seen.

16:37.830 --> 16:42.292
-His absence diminishes his power.
-I don't have to explain myself to you.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.962
Now, do not bother me again.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.217
[electronic beeping]

16:50.926 --> 16:53.721
-What's going on?
-We received a distress signal.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.558
One of our convoys has been ambushed
by a squadron of Galra cruisers.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.393
Our medical supply ships.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.813
-We can't allow the Galra to get them.
-We must leave immediately.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.190
Voltron can keep those cruisers
occupied long enough

17:05.315 --> 17:07.067
for the supply ships to make their escape.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.154
Actually, Voltron can't. Keith is gone.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.991
They're probably on a mission.
I knew this would happen sooner or later.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.910
You'll have to go without Keith.
The convoy needs you immediately.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.454
I'll send him to help
as soon as I find him.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.216
-[alarm blaring]
-[all grunting]

17:38.432 --> 17:40.309
We gotta get that ship
out of the tractor beam.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.436
I'll try to ram it out. Cover me!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.361
Uh...
[grunting]

17:51.487 --> 17:54.323
Never mind! There's too many!
I can't ram that many!

18:00.954 --> 18:02.581
[Hunk]
Someone must've called for backup!

18:06.126 --> 18:07.503
[Lance] They're everywhere!

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
[Pidge] There are more fighters
than we've ever seen!

18:13.926 --> 18:16.720
[Lance] Allura, I need your help!
I got two on my tail!

18:16.845 --> 18:19.473
[Allura] I'm sorry, I can't get to you!
They're all over me!

18:19.598 --> 18:22.643
-What are you doing?
-Whatever I can.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.776
[exhales deeply]

18:32.528 --> 18:35.322
[Hunk]
I take out one, but two more replace it!

18:35.447 --> 18:37.199
[Allura]
The supply ship is almost captured.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.743
-Can anyone get to it?
-[Lance] I'm trying!

18:40.452 --> 18:43.163
-[Hunk] Where are they all coming from?
-[Pidge] Watch out behind you!

18:43.247 --> 18:44.790
[Allura] Do the rebel ships have a shot?

18:44.873 --> 18:47.376
[Lance] I have a visual on them.
They're dead in the water.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.086
[Allura] We can't do this without Voltron!

18:49.169 --> 18:50.838
[Lance]
Where is Keith?

18:50.963 --> 18:54.049
Please, people's lives are at stake.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.136
You trusted me once.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.972
Trust me again.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.394
[gasps]

19:08.730 --> 19:10.941
[roars]

19:18.157 --> 19:21.160
There's no way we can beat
all these fighters with only four lions!

19:21.285 --> 19:22.327
[Shiro] You don't have to!

19:22.452 --> 19:23.787
-Shiro!
-No way!

19:30.669 --> 19:34.298
Converge on me. It's time to form Voltron!

19:35.007 --> 19:36.175
[roars]

20:14.087 --> 20:15.464
[gasps]

20:16.798 --> 20:18.842
[Shiro] Rebel craft, you're safe.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.929
We'll escort you the rest of the way
to Olkarion.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.272
Guys, I...

20:36.151 --> 20:39.613
I heard what happened.
I'm sorry I wasn't there to help.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.866
You keep saying you're sorry,
but your actions say otherwise.

20:42.991 --> 20:46.036
Do you realize that your absence
put the team in jeopardy?

20:46.161 --> 20:48.664
And not just the team,
the refugees as well.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.833
Matter of fact,
the entire quadrant was in danger.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.254
This is not the way
I wanted this to happen,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.257
but, if there's a bright side
to any of this,

20:58.382 --> 21:00.092
it's that my absence allowed Shiro

21:00.217 --> 21:03.136
to reestablish his bond
with the Black Lion.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.306
He can finally be the leader
I was unable to be.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.183
I'm not meant to pilot the Black Lion.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.435
Is that why
you've been pulling away from us?

21:10.560 --> 21:13.939
Yeah. I suppose that's part of it.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.149
Part of it? What's the other part?

21:17.609 --> 21:19.069
The Blades have been making headway

21:19.152 --> 21:21.196
tracking the source
of this new quintessence.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.366
They've been able to piece together
a large network of hidden supply lines

21:24.491 --> 21:27.911
that have been secretly transporting it
for who knows how long.

21:28.036 --> 21:32.040
And there's good reason to believe
it could lead us directly to Lotor.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.586
A mission is being planned
to infiltrate the supply line.

21:37.212 --> 21:40.090
It could take weeks,
maybe months to pull off, but...

21:40.215 --> 21:41.633
if there is a chance...

21:42.301 --> 21:43.885
we have...

21:45.012 --> 21:48.765
I have to take it.
I need to be on that mission.

21:51.143 --> 21:55.480
Shiro, you are the rightful leader
of this team.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.233
And you proved it today
by reconnecting with the Black Lion.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.777
It was always meant to be yours.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.363
Keith...

22:04.656 --> 22:08.618
if this is what you feel is right,
then we won't try to stop you.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.997
But just know that we're here
for you whenever you need us.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.750
I know you are.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.169
And I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.426
I can't be left out of this.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.429
[sobbing]

22:27.554 --> 22:29.514
We're really gonna miss you.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.684
Yeah, who am I gonna make fun of?

22:32.809 --> 22:35.187
I know you'll make us proud.
