00:00.619 --> 00:02.485
Previously, on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.553 --> 00:04.747
You're all flying
to New York City

00:04.787 --> 00:07.305
to see BLT Steak
firsthand.

00:07.329 --> 00:09.179
Big apple, whoo!

00:09.213 --> 00:10.900
Chef Ramsay
surprised the chefs

00:10.901 --> 00:12.625
with an inspirational
trip to New York City.

00:12.659 --> 00:14.345
<i>Wow.</i>

00:14.454 --> 00:16.328
I'm ready to go all the way

00:16.411 --> 00:18.512
and to become head chef
at BLT Steak.

00:18.564 --> 00:21.499
When they returned, the chefs
were randomly given an ethnic cuisine...

00:21.566 --> 00:22.566
And the ethnic cuisine is...

00:22.634 --> 00:23.801
Jamaican!

00:23.868 --> 00:25.436
Chinese.
Mexican.

00:25.504 --> 00:26.837
French.
Good luck!

00:26.905 --> 00:28.105
And were challenged

00:28.173 --> 00:29.440
to be as creative
as possible.

00:29.508 --> 00:30.775
The spirit of Santo
be with me.

00:30.842 --> 00:32.058
What the heck is this?

00:32.144 --> 00:33.360
Chef Ramsay decided

00:33.438 --> 00:35.345
the best dish would win it
for their team

00:35.413 --> 00:36.374
king of the hill!

00:36.420 --> 00:37.814
And that dish belonged to...

00:37.881 --> 00:39.282
Jennifer!

00:39.350 --> 00:40.350
Good job.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.573
A dinner service,

00:43.643 --> 00:44.501
in the blue kitchen...
Natalie!

00:44.533 --> 00:46.589
Natalie had her
worst dinner service yet.

00:46.657 --> 00:48.625
Bass returned!
Dry!

00:48.693 --> 00:49.915
I don't know
what I'm doing.

00:49.938 --> 00:51.393
You hit the nail
on the head there.

00:51.461 --> 00:52.761
In the red kitchen...

00:52.829 --> 00:54.363
You guys need
to work together right now.

00:54.431 --> 00:56.131
Jennifer was
the lone voice of sanity

00:56.199 --> 00:58.463
as Elise picked a fight
with the blue kitchen.

00:58.486 --> 01:00.769
Did you or did you not score
the first tray of Wellingtons?

01:00.837 --> 01:02.538
No. Hook me up
to a polygraph.

01:02.605 --> 01:03.729
I'm telling you the damn truth.
Yeah.

01:03.752 --> 01:05.507
And Elizabeth came unglued.

01:05.575 --> 01:06.709
Four minutes
on this cod, chef.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.243
That's a bass you got.

01:08.311 --> 01:09.777
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, chef.

01:09.846 --> 01:11.146
I'm sorry, chef.
I'm sorry, chef.

01:11.214 --> 01:12.113
It's my fault, chef.
I'm very sorry, chef.

01:12.181 --> 01:13.448
Get it together!

01:13.515 --> 01:15.217
In the end, both teams

01:15.284 --> 01:17.452
were forced to nominate
one person for elimination.

01:17.519 --> 01:19.154
Ultimately,
the Red Team chose...

01:19.222 --> 01:20.196
Elise, chef.

01:20.235 --> 01:21.689
And the Blue Team selected...

01:21.757 --> 01:23.124
Natalie, chef.

01:23.192 --> 01:24.191
And chef Ramsay decided...

01:24.259 --> 01:25.492
Natalie.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.361
You are not ready
to run BLT Steak.

01:27.428 --> 01:28.675
Can you give me
your jacket?

01:28.715 --> 01:30.130
Extinguishing her dreams

01:30.198 --> 01:31.431
of becoming head chef

01:31.499 --> 01:33.633
at BLT Steak
in New York City.

02:12.771 --> 02:14.171
Yes!

02:25.117 --> 02:26.550
Wah!

02:40.649 --> 02:44.072
And now, the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:44.968 --> 02:46.302
Get out of here.

02:46.369 --> 02:47.769
I saw that coming.

02:50.183 --> 02:52.041
I'm so grateful

02:52.108 --> 02:53.909
to be here another day.

02:53.977 --> 02:55.544
I had a bad night tonight,

02:55.611 --> 02:57.479
but tomorrow's
gonna be a new day.

02:59.349 --> 03:00.881
I'm gonna put this behind me

03:00.950 --> 03:02.250
and move forward
with my best foot.

03:02.318 --> 03:04.390
I hope that my team
does that too.

03:04.713 --> 03:09.104
Sync by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:10.826 --> 03:12.994
We're down to
six people, y'all.

03:15.597 --> 03:17.630
 <i>This is gonna be,
like,</i> <i>a high-intensity day.</i>

03:17.698 --> 03:20.233
And I need to calm down.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.002
<i>Yesterday night,</i>
<i>that was a fluke.</i>

03:22.070 --> 03:25.405
I know I will not
be frazzled again.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.506
No matter what.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.009
Elizabeth has this weird,

03:29.077 --> 03:30.277
like, track record

03:30.345 --> 03:32.244
where she just,
like, panics.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.779
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, chef.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.314
I'm sorry, chef.
I'm sorry, chef.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.215
It's my fault, chef.
I'm very sorry, chef.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.683
I'm sorry, chef.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.085
At this stage of the game,

03:39.152 --> 03:40.152
that cannot be happening.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.620
I just want to shake her.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.422
It just scares me
that I was capable

03:43.490 --> 03:44.957
of  up so much.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.159
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>i had that in me.</i>

03:49.395 --> 03:51.729
After one of their
weaker dinner services,

03:51.797 --> 03:53.764
both teams are eager
for redemption.

03:53.832 --> 03:55.867
Let's go!

03:55.934 --> 03:57.802
And chef Ramsay
is eager to test them.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.137
<i>Right, good morning!</i>

03:59.205 --> 04:00.605
Good morning, chef.

04:00.672 --> 04:02.840
You know, as a chef,
every day

04:02.908 --> 04:04.774
<i>we're always</i>
<i>fighting the clock.</i>

04:04.842 --> 04:06.143
<i>You saw my frustrations</i>
<i>last night on service,</i>

04:06.211 --> 04:08.012
where your timing's
been out of sync.

04:08.079 --> 04:11.081
<i>That is what your next</i>
<i>challenge is all about.</i>

04:11.149 --> 04:14.451
Each team will be making
three stunning dishes.

04:14.519 --> 04:17.454
<i>One chef from each team</i>
<i>will be making</i>

04:17.522 --> 04:19.289
a 30-minute entree.

04:19.357 --> 04:20.856
<i>One chef from each team</i>

04:20.923 --> 04:24.394
will be making
a 20-minute entree.

04:24.461 --> 04:26.562
<i>And then, finally,</i>
<i>one chef from each team</i>

04:26.630 --> 04:29.698
will be making
a ten-minute entree.

04:29.766 --> 04:31.934
<i>All dishes</i>
<i>must hit the pass</i>

04:32.002 --> 04:33.169
together...

04:33.237 --> 04:35.204
Oh, my God.
<i>At precisely</i>

04:35.272 --> 04:36.704
the 30-minute Mark.

04:36.772 --> 04:37.939
<i>The team</i>
<i>with the best dishes</i>

04:38.007 --> 04:39.041
<i>wins the challenge.</i>

04:39.108 --> 04:41.276
You now have one minute

04:41.344 --> 04:44.579
to decide on
who's cooking what entree.

04:44.647 --> 04:46.515
Off you go.

04:46.582 --> 04:48.483
30, 20, 10.
You got it.

04:48.551 --> 04:50.052
I gave Tommy the 30 'cause

04:50.119 --> 04:51.553
Tommy is more of a thinker.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.087
Will can think
quick on his feet,

04:53.155 --> 04:54.288
and I just
took the middle.

04:54.356 --> 04:55.489
I don't think
I should do ten.

04:55.557 --> 04:56.590
I think I should do
either 30 or 20.

04:56.658 --> 04:58.259
I jumped on
the 30-minute dish

04:58.326 --> 05:00.327
because I know I can't cook
in ten minutes.

05:00.395 --> 05:03.130
The way my mind works,
it's not the best place for me.

05:03.198 --> 05:04.365
Do you feel like
you can do ten?

05:04.433 --> 05:06.567
I... I can do ten minute.

05:06.634 --> 05:08.568
<i>Red Team, Blue Team,</i>
<i>are you ready?</i>

05:08.635 --> 05:09.569
Yes, chef.

05:09.636 --> 05:10.703
<i>Your 30 minutes...</i>

05:10.771 --> 05:11.971
Starts now.

05:12.039 --> 05:13.540
<i>All right!</i> 
Go, go, go, go.

05:13.607 --> 05:15.075
<i>Go, Tommy.</i> 
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

05:15.142 --> 05:16.642
For this next challenge,

05:16.710 --> 05:17.944
chef Ramsay is testing
the chefs' ability

05:18.011 --> 05:20.046
to work within time limits.

05:20.114 --> 05:23.183
Each team must create
a 30-minute, 20-minute,

05:23.250 --> 05:24.883
and ten-minute entree.

05:24.951 --> 05:27.219
<i>Come on, Tommy.</i> 
I'm already on it.

05:27.287 --> 05:29.020
Though there will
be three different start times,

05:29.089 --> 05:31.156
all three dishes
must be completed

05:31.224 --> 05:33.225
and arrive at the pass
at the same time.

05:33.293 --> 05:35.594
Jennifer,
what's over three?

05:35.661 --> 05:37.429
Is there a pancetta
over there?

05:37.497 --> 05:38.797
<i>That first tray</i>
<i>with the mushrooms,</i>

05:38.864 --> 05:40.431
that's not pancetta?

05:40.499 --> 05:42.066
I jumped on the 30-minute dish

05:42.134 --> 05:43.834
because I need that time
to think.

05:43.902 --> 05:45.803
Uh, Jennifer,
are you using mushrooms?

05:45.870 --> 05:47.405
<i>Are there hen-of-the-woods</i>
<i>over there?</i>

05:47.473 --> 05:48.739
<i>That one's not</i>
<i>hen-of-the-woods?</i>

05:48.807 --> 05:49.807
No, looks like a shitake.

05:49.874 --> 05:51.409
Shut the  up.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.077
I need five freaking
minutes to figure out

05:53.145 --> 05:54.112
what I'm doing.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.546
Anything we can use?

05:55.614 --> 05:57.680
Red peppers, oranges,
mushrooms.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.283
Oysters is another option
you have.

06:00.351 --> 06:02.785
You guys listening?
No. Of course not.

06:02.853 --> 06:06.223
While the women seem focused
on their own individual dishes,

06:06.290 --> 06:08.024
over in the blue kitchen...

06:08.092 --> 06:10.460
You need to get your stuff
going right now, Tommy.

06:10.528 --> 06:13.229
The men's focus
Tommy.

06:13.296 --> 06:15.030
Tommy, what protein
you using?

06:15.098 --> 06:16.632
Lamb. All right, don't
wait on the lamb.

06:16.699 --> 06:18.667
<i>Don't forget to take</i>
<i>that fat cap off, Tom!</i>

06:18.735 --> 06:20.503
<i>The whole cap</i>
<i>should peel off.</i>

06:20.570 --> 06:22.204
There you go. There you go.
There you go.

06:22.272 --> 06:23.439
I'm gonna say
what I have to say

06:23.507 --> 06:24.640
to try to get a fire
under Tommy's ass

06:24.707 --> 06:25.508
to makes sure
that he's moving.

06:25.575 --> 06:27.276
I'm the kind of guy that,

06:27.344 --> 06:29.210
if I have something to say,
I'm gonna say it.

06:29.278 --> 06:31.112
Don't forget to talk to him
the entire time, all right bro?

06:31.180 --> 06:33.948
Ten minutes into
the timing challenge...

06:34.016 --> 06:36.351
20 minutes, chefs.
In the kitchen, let's go!

06:36.418 --> 06:37.552
Elizabeth and
Paul are ready to get started

06:37.620 --> 06:39.654
on their 20-minute entrees.

06:39.721 --> 06:41.489
I'm not worried about
what I can do in 20 minutes.

06:41.557 --> 06:43.824
It's totally, 100% game on.

06:43.892 --> 06:45.459
Pauly is gonna be
on  top.

06:45.527 --> 06:47.427
I'm gonna show you why
I'm a big deal.

06:47.495 --> 06:48.895
What are you
going with, Pauly?

06:48.963 --> 06:51.298
It's made of water,
fish, salad.

06:51.366 --> 06:53.534
I'm gonna do monkfish.

06:53.601 --> 06:55.869
And I am going to do it
with couscous.

06:55.936 --> 06:57.404
And asparagus.

06:57.472 --> 06:59.906
Get the couscous on,
right now.

06:59.974 --> 07:02.241
As the chefs
race against the clock...

07:02.309 --> 07:04.076
<i>Go! Last ten minutes.</i>

07:04.144 --> 07:06.111
It's time for will and Elise

07:06.180 --> 07:07.846
to take their shot
at creating something special

07:07.914 --> 07:09.081
in ten minutes.

07:09.149 --> 07:10.916
Oh, there's a hot pepper.

07:10.984 --> 07:12.652
I don't see shallots.
Where's shallots, Jennifer?

07:12.719 --> 07:13.286
You already done
with the mandolin?

07:13.353 --> 07:14.253
<i>Yeah, take it!</i>

07:14.321 --> 07:15.054
Elise, what
are you doing?

07:15.121 --> 07:16.055
Spicy calamari.

07:16.122 --> 07:17.622
How's everyone doing?

07:17.690 --> 07:19.057
With time winding down...

07:19.124 --> 07:21.193
I have raw  lamb
right now.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.927
Jennifer has
made a dire discovery.

07:22.995 --> 07:24.162
Me.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.763
My lamb is not ready yet.

07:25.831 --> 07:27.232
I'm, like, freaking out.
This sucks.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.900
I don't understand
why Jen's freaking out.

07:28.967 --> 07:30.468
She's like, "uh! Uh, uh!"

07:30.536 --> 07:32.303
I mean, at this point
in the game,

07:32.370 --> 07:34.405
you gotta be able
to cook a dish in 30 minutes.

07:34.472 --> 07:35.639
Three minutes left!

07:35.707 --> 07:36.973
I have raw lamb.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.309
How raw, Jennifer?

07:38.376 --> 07:39.843
Like, raw!
Get 'em in a Pan!

07:39.911 --> 07:41.378
- I am!
- It's gotta  heat up!

07:41.446 --> 07:42.379
I have blue meat right now.

07:42.447 --> 07:43.681
Not even rare.

07:43.748 --> 07:44.748
No one wants
to eat blue meat.

07:44.816 --> 07:46.083
90 seconds to go!

07:46.150 --> 07:47.618
90 seconds.

07:47.686 --> 07:49.252
No way this
is gonna be ready.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.587
Tommy, you just about
ready, bro?

07:50.654 --> 07:51.688
Yeah.
<i>We gotta plate now.</i>

07:51.755 --> 07:53.489
God.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.990
<i>Five...Four...</i>

07:55.058 --> 07:56.492
<i>Three...</i> 
Tommy, we gotta walk!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.027
<i>Two...One...</i>

07:58.095 --> 07:59.729
<i>And serve!</i>

07:59.796 --> 08:01.197
<i>Okay...</i>

08:01.265 --> 08:03.433
Let's start off
with the battle

08:03.500 --> 08:05.734
<i>of the 30-minute dishes.</i>

08:06.802 --> 08:08.437
<i>Tommy, what is it, please?</i>

08:08.504 --> 08:10.205
The lamb has a quail egg
on top of a hash.

08:10.273 --> 08:11.873
Quail egg
on top of lamb?

08:11.941 --> 08:12.807
Mm-hmm.

08:14.444 --> 08:15.810
Look like
it's cooked properly.

08:15.878 --> 08:16.978
Great sear on the lamb.

08:19.014 --> 08:20.081
<i>I never thought about</i>

08:20.149 --> 08:21.716
using quail egg on lamb.

08:21.783 --> 08:23.083
<i>But it actually works</i>
<i>quite well.</i>

08:23.151 --> 08:24.084
Damn.

08:24.152 --> 08:25.152
Thank you.

08:25.220 --> 08:27.020
<i>Jennifer...</i>

08:27.088 --> 08:29.022
Would you mind
describing the dish, please?

08:29.090 --> 08:30.624
It's probably the worst dish
I ever made in my life.

08:30.691 --> 08:32.327
- What?
- Yes.

08:33.023 --> 08:34.506
Young lady,
you had 30 minutes.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.557
I'm telling you,
the lamb was a little rare.

08:36.635 --> 08:39.871
I'm trying to, like, imagine,
like, what Jennifer's thinking,

08:39.938 --> 08:42.543
pointing out exactly
what was wrong on her dish,

08:42.668 --> 08:44.181
which is crazy.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.643
The lamb...

08:46.662 --> 08:47.895
Is pink.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.146
That's not raw.

08:49.213 --> 08:51.181
<i>Wow, I should go</i>
<i>to Vegas right now.</i>

08:51.249 --> 08:52.349
'Cause I'm one lucky girl.

08:52.417 --> 08:53.450
The lamb's delicious.

08:53.518 --> 08:54.918
<i>Sauce is delicious.</i>

08:54.986 --> 08:56.820
<i>I love the dish.</i> 
<i>Wow.</i>

08:56.888 --> 08:58.888
<i>Good job.</i> 
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

08:58.990 --> 09:00.891
The 30-minute dish...

09:00.958 --> 09:02.633
Congratulations, Red Team.

09:05.672 --> 09:06.462
<i>Good job.</i>

09:06.530 --> 09:07.830
<i>One, nothing to the red.</i>

09:07.898 --> 09:09.839
Okay, 20-minute dishes, please.
Let's go.

09:09.954 --> 09:11.387
Come on, Pauly.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.570
<i>Okay, Paul.</i> What is it, please?

09:14.638 --> 09:16.238
It's a Pan-roasted
sea bass, chef.

09:16.307 --> 09:17.957
A great sear.
Thank you, chef.

09:18.222 --> 09:19.122
<i>Opaque in the center.</i>

09:20.810 --> 09:23.354
<i>Needs reducing</i> <i>a little bit
,</i> because it's a little bit watery.

09:23.424 --> 09:24.379
<i>However, I've got that</i>

09:24.447 --> 09:27.117
zest of something
sort of refreshing and light.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.249
<i>It's got finesse.</i>

09:28.318 --> 09:29.884
I talk the game,
and I  back it up.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.320
I can do beautiful dishes
that taste good

09:31.387 --> 09:33.578
and look very nice
for 20 minutes,

09:33.664 --> 09:35.261
I'm the biggest
of all the  deals.

09:35.339 --> 09:36.558
Elizabeth,
what is it, please?

09:36.675 --> 09:38.058
<i>I did monkfish</i>
<i>with couscous.</i>

09:38.126 --> 09:41.869
<i>I thought it might have</i>
<i>French of mediterranean type</i>

09:42.064 --> 09:43.798
<i>feel to it.</i>

09:43.865 --> 09:45.433
<i>The monkfish,</i>
<i>you've nailed perfectly.</i>

09:45.500 --> 09:47.209
Slightly opaque,

09:47.295 --> 09:48.669
a little bit translucent
in the center.

09:48.737 --> 09:50.737
Thank you, chef.
Couscous, slightly bland.

09:51.238 --> 09:52.706
The hard part, you nailed,
cooking the monkfish.

09:52.773 --> 09:53.940
<i>Tastes delicious.</i>

09:54.539 --> 09:56.258
Two good dishes.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.367
Point goes to...

09:59.913 --> 10:01.348
Blue Team. Congratulations.
Thank you, chef.

10:01.415 --> 10:02.415
Love the finesse on that.

10:02.483 --> 10:03.216
Thank you.
Love it.

10:03.283 --> 10:05.251
Good job, Pauly.

10:05.319 --> 10:06.952
It all comes down
to the battle

10:07.019 --> 10:07.953
of the ten-minute entree...
Let's go.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.455
Come on, Will.
Come on, Will.

10:09.522 --> 10:12.573
The chefs that had the least
amount of time.

10:14.394 --> 10:15.927
Will, what is that,
please?

10:15.995 --> 10:17.642
Lemon-seared
Santa Barbara prawns.

10:17.939 --> 10:18.930
I'm here to win.

10:18.998 --> 10:20.966
Everyone should consider me
their biggest threat.

10:21.033 --> 10:22.933
I know I consider me
my biggest threat.

10:23.001 --> 10:24.469
<i>I seared them</i>
<i>in the shell just to get</i>

10:24.536 --> 10:25.135
a little more
flavor out of them,

10:25.203 --> 10:26.471
then I peeled them.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.005
And the vegetables,
what'd you put in there?

10:28.073 --> 10:30.007
Salt, pepper,
olive oil, and garlic.

10:30.075 --> 10:32.443
It's cooked beautifully.
Yeah, unfortunately,

10:32.511 --> 10:34.111
these vegetables have got
too much garlic in there,

10:34.179 --> 10:36.016
so it's too overpowering.

10:36.531 --> 10:37.781
<i>Elise, what is it, please?</i>

10:37.849 --> 10:41.117
It's a spicy calamari
with a tomato-pepper sauce.

10:41.185 --> 10:42.819
How did you cook
the calamari?

10:42.887 --> 10:44.521
I fried it first
and then tossed it in

10:44.589 --> 10:46.552
<i>with the tomato sauce last.</i>

10:47.515 --> 10:48.581
I like the heat.

10:48.883 --> 10:49.826
Tomato, the peppers.

10:49.894 --> 10:51.895
<i>But the calamari</i>

10:51.936 --> 10:53.835
are undercooked.

10:54.746 --> 10:56.912
Congratulations goes to...

10:57.319 --> 10:58.152
Um...

11:05.242 --> 11:07.978
The score is tied
in today's timing challenge.

11:08.045 --> 11:11.214
And now it all comes down
to will's Santa Barbara prawns

11:11.282 --> 11:13.951
versus Elise's fried calamari.

11:15.819 --> 11:18.521
<i>Congratulation goes to...</i>

11:18.589 --> 11:19.989
Blue Team.
Good job.

11:20.056 --> 11:21.858
Thank you, chef.
You win the challenge.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.367
Well done,
brother.

11:25.629 --> 11:26.929
Oh, look at that face.

11:28.298 --> 11:29.599
Blue Team, today,

11:29.666 --> 11:31.299
you're gonna be
rewarded in style.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.400
<i>You're going on</i>
<i>a shopping spree.</i>

11:32.468 --> 11:33.468
What?!

11:33.536 --> 11:34.836
<i>In one of L.A.'s</i>

11:34.904 --> 11:36.337
<i>trendiest boutiques.</i>

11:36.405 --> 11:38.006
Ted Baker of London,

11:38.073 --> 11:39.307
<i>one of my favorite</i>
<i>all-time designers.</i>

11:39.375 --> 11:40.441
Are you kidding me?

11:40.510 --> 11:41.376
I'm definitely gonna pimp out

11:41.443 --> 11:42.844
some chef Ramsay clothes, man.

11:42.912 --> 11:44.579
I wanna look like
chef Ramsay.

11:44.647 --> 11:46.214
I'm even
gonna talk with an accent.

11:46.281 --> 11:47.247
I want you to arrive
in style.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.616
So there's a limo waiting.

11:48.683 --> 11:50.450
Ohh!
<i>Awesome.</i>

11:50.519 --> 11:52.419
This reward was perfect.

11:52.487 --> 11:53.787
I mean, a shopping spree.

11:53.855 --> 11:55.288
I  love to shop.

11:55.356 --> 11:57.958
I love shopping.
I love shopping.

11:58.026 --> 11:59.226
I love shopping.
I love shopping.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.163
<i>Okay, I need</i>
<i>to tell you all something</i>

12:04.231 --> 12:05.498
very important.

12:05.566 --> 12:07.033
<i>For the first time</i>

12:07.100 --> 12:08.401
<i>in our history</i>
<i>of</i> Hell's Kitchen,

12:08.468 --> 12:10.436
<i>we'll be hosting a unique,</i>

12:10.504 --> 12:13.640
exclusive black tie
charity event.

12:13.707 --> 12:14.641
What?

12:14.708 --> 12:15.708
There are only gonna be

12:15.776 --> 12:17.309
two tables of 12.

12:17.377 --> 12:20.345
We'll be serving
a six-course menu.

12:20.413 --> 12:23.114
Understand the importance
of this dinner.

12:23.182 --> 12:24.115
<i>Got it?</i>

12:24.183 --> 12:25.517
Got it.
Yes, chef.

12:25.585 --> 12:27.218
Blue Team, limo's waiting.

12:27.286 --> 12:28.486
Yes, chef. Thank you. Good luck!

12:28.555 --> 12:31.489
<i>Ladies...</i>

12:31.558 --> 12:32.791
<i>You'll be setting up</i>
<i>both kitchens</i>

12:32.859 --> 12:33.825
<i>for tonight's service.</i>

12:33.893 --> 12:35.260
After you set up
both kitchens,

12:35.327 --> 12:36.294
<i>i need two</i>
<i>banquet tables moved in</i>

12:36.362 --> 12:37.595
<i>and I want you to</i>

12:37.663 --> 12:39.264
reorganize
the dining room.

12:39.331 --> 12:40.365
Yes, chef.

12:40.433 --> 12:41.366
Get cleaning.

12:42.668 --> 12:44.769
Stop crying.

12:44.836 --> 12:47.238
Bounce back, Elise!

12:50.842 --> 12:51.942
Bye-bye, ladies.

12:52.009 --> 12:52.776
Bye.

12:54.045 --> 12:55.245
I accept gifts.

12:55.313 --> 12:56.580
<i>Feel free</i>
<i>to buy me gifts.</i>

12:58.015 --> 13:00.016
It sucks that I had
one of the best dishes,

13:00.085 --> 13:01.385
and I still have to stay back
and do a punishment.

13:01.453 --> 13:02.819
Just like, ugh!

13:02.887 --> 13:04.321
I'm gonna get a fur co..

13:04.389 --> 13:05.789
Ah,  ] me.

13:05.856 --> 13:07.256
Oh, my God!

13:07.324 --> 13:08.857
You can see the sky!

13:08.925 --> 13:10.726
Freedom!

13:10.794 --> 13:12.361
My primary focus right now

13:12.429 --> 13:14.130
is to go out and spend
chef Ramsay's money.

13:14.198 --> 13:16.198
I'm gonna have
a smile on my face.

13:16.766 --> 13:20.069
Ohh!

13:20.137 --> 13:21.270
I'm pretty stoked
about the limo.

13:21.338 --> 13:22.405
I'm rich, bitch!

13:22.473 --> 13:24.339
I mean, I'm a big deal.

13:24.407 --> 13:25.507
That's just come sense.

13:25.575 --> 13:26.708
Whoo!
Hey!

13:26.775 --> 13:28.042
Oh, my God!!

13:28.111 --> 13:29.478
Get off of me!

13:29.545 --> 13:31.012
You son of a bitch.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.248
<i>I need new clothes now.</i>

13:33.316 --> 13:34.649
<i>Are we on rodeo drive?</i>

13:34.717 --> 13:37.119
Yeah!
I'm bored now.

13:37.186 --> 13:38.587
I could live with
cruising around Beverly hills

13:38.654 --> 13:39.853
in a limousine.

13:39.921 --> 13:41.421
It's actually
a pretty good time.

13:42.290 --> 13:43.791
Hello, ladies.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.993
When the Blue
Team is cruising in style,

13:46.027 --> 13:47.628
back in Hell's Kitchen,
the Red Team...

13:47.695 --> 13:49.896
How we gonna do this?
Can we slide it?

13:49.964 --> 13:51.210
Has hit a roadblock.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.175
Okay, go.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.701
Uh-oh.
This is heavy.

13:55.769 --> 13:58.338
Oh, , we can't even,
like, budge this table.

13:58.439 --> 14:00.240
We can't just push it from behind?
No.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.874
Can you stand here
and hold this?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.743
This is where
I'm gonna crack today.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.278
I'm not the most
physically fit person here.

14:05.346 --> 14:07.147
But, like, do they not
have muscles?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.348
Oh,.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.315
You guys need
to lift it up.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.218
Elise and Elizabeth
are, like, lifting

14:13.286 --> 14:14.419
an inch
off the ground.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.954
Lift it up to your chest.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.222
Up to here.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.124
Just pick it up
and let's get it done.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.459
I'm picking it up
as much as I can.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.360
Uhh!

14:24.864 --> 14:25.764
Ted Baker!

14:27.499 --> 14:29.167
Hello. Hello, ladies.
<i>Hi, welcome.</i>

14:29.234 --> 14:30.801
We're gonna help you.
<i>Awesome.</i>

14:30.869 --> 14:32.436
Okay, so what
are we looking for?

14:32.504 --> 14:34.038
Ah, psh...

14:34.105 --> 14:35.839
I don't know where to start,
man... I don't shop.

14:35.907 --> 14:37.542
I have a wife.
She shops for me.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.109
Why don't you guys
take a look around

14:39.178 --> 14:40.944
and start picking things out.

14:41.012 --> 14:42.413
I'm not a stylish dude.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.446
Really?
You got a leather vest on.

14:43.514 --> 14:44.814
I wear this every day.

14:44.882 --> 14:46.449
There you go.
That's pretty stylin'.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.552
I had no idea,
till I walked in there,

14:48.619 --> 14:50.353
that I was such
a stylish individual.

14:50.421 --> 14:51.721
Hey, will,
what do you think of this?

14:51.789 --> 14:53.356
He looks like
a sexy train robber.

14:53.424 --> 14:54.991
Go for it, Tommy.

14:55.059 --> 14:56.526
Will, is this shirt pink?

14:56.594 --> 14:58.261
I don't think
it's pink at all, bro.

14:58.329 --> 14:59.662
I think you're colorblind...
That color brings out

14:59.729 --> 15:01.029
the brightness
in your eyes, bro.

15:01.097 --> 15:01.763
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
You're welcome.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.800
Long as I get enough
gangsta lean on it, man.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.268
I like that a lot.

15:06.336 --> 15:07.836
For my gal, for, like,
the nice dinner dates.

15:07.904 --> 15:09.672
She'd love it.
<i>She's my size?</i>

15:09.739 --> 15:11.240
She's...

15:11.308 --> 15:13.108
I don't really know much
about women's sizing.

15:13.176 --> 15:14.543
I'm not trying
to give you, like,

15:14.611 --> 15:16.077
the creepy look
up and down.

15:16.144 --> 15:17.445
But I'm trying to think
what size... yeah, you are.

15:17.513 --> 15:18.179
What size
my girl is right now.

15:18.247 --> 15:20.348
So I kinda just said...

15:20.416 --> 15:21.649
About your size.

15:21.717 --> 15:23.518
I'm a zero,
so she's probably a one.

15:23.586 --> 15:25.186
Yeah.
We'll do that.

15:25.254 --> 15:26.987
The highlight of my day

15:27.055 --> 15:28.556
is definitely finding
my girlfriend a beautiful dress.

15:28.624 --> 15:30.091
I can't wait
to see her in it,

15:30.158 --> 15:32.259
and it's making me
miss her even more.

15:32.327 --> 15:34.027
Thank you very much.
Really appreciate it. No problem.

15:34.095 --> 15:36.162
Tell Ted I said hello.
I will.

15:36.231 --> 15:37.864
While the men finish
up their shopping spree...

15:37.932 --> 15:39.898
Thank you, sir.

15:39.966 --> 15:41.834
The Red Team continues
to make over the dining room.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.603
The table looks blingin'.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.804
Y'all did y'all
candles different.

15:45.872 --> 15:48.341
I like the candles
like that.

15:48.408 --> 15:51.344
So now I have
to change my whole thing.

15:51.411 --> 15:52.645
Out and in.
Out and in.

15:54.047 --> 15:55.347
Are you serious?

15:55.414 --> 15:56.881
If Elise tells me
one more time

15:56.949 --> 15:58.617
where to move
the candlesticks,

15:58.684 --> 16:00.385
it's gonna be a bloodbath.

16:00.453 --> 16:03.455
I have a place for
this candlestick right now.

16:04.957 --> 16:06.424
What up, ladies?

16:06.492 --> 16:09.894
<i>We had the most</i>
<i>fabulous day shopping.</i>

16:09.962 --> 16:11.061
Where's your outfits?

16:11.129 --> 16:12.496
Check this out.

16:12.564 --> 16:13.764
I got you something.

16:13.831 --> 16:15.232
Here you go.
It's handkerchief.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.267
So next time I kick
your ass in a challenge,

16:16.334 --> 16:17.468
you can cry all over it!

16:22.807 --> 16:24.875
- With a V.I.P.
- charity dinner ahead of them,

16:24.942 --> 16:26.609
the chefs
are all business.

16:26.677 --> 16:28.278
All right, shaved carrot.

16:28.345 --> 16:29.879
Each chef will be in charge

16:29.946 --> 16:32.649
of two courses of the special
six-course meal.

16:32.716 --> 16:35.117
These are the dishes you will
individually be in charge of.

16:35.185 --> 16:37.353
You gotta know 'em backwards.
Yes, chef.

16:37.421 --> 16:39.155
<i>So, Jen,</i>
<i>you'll be responsible</i>

16:39.222 --> 16:41.457
for the lobster
and the appetizer ten.

16:41.525 --> 16:43.158
We each have an assignment.

16:43.225 --> 16:44.559
We're reach responsible
for our two courses.

16:44.627 --> 16:46.662
It doesn't seem
really complicated,

16:46.729 --> 16:50.165
but one person can't do
12 plates by themselves.

16:50.232 --> 16:53.134
Tonight, we need
to work together.

16:53.202 --> 16:54.670
<i>Come here.</i>

16:54.737 --> 16:55.937
<i>We need</i>
<i>to have a team meeting.</i>

16:56.005 --> 16:58.106
My plan was for both of us
to work risottos,

16:58.174 --> 17:00.140
and then for her
to drop the calamari.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.375
I'll work squid,

17:01.443 --> 17:02.777
but I need
to be working

17:02.844 --> 17:03.877
my chicken
at the same time.

17:03.945 --> 17:04.978
So you can't help.
Okay.

17:05.046 --> 17:06.847
<i>So, Jennifer,</i>
<i>it'll be</i>

17:06.915 --> 17:08.080
<i>just me and you</i>
<i>working risotto</i>

17:08.148 --> 17:10.184
because she can't help.

17:10.251 --> 17:12.353
<i>You keep being a boss.</i> 
I'm not!

17:12.421 --> 17:13.921
You're, like,
attacking me,

17:13.988 --> 17:15.087
because this is what
you do best.

17:15.155 --> 17:16.790
My God.

17:16.857 --> 17:18.525
I've been patient with Elise,

17:18.592 --> 17:20.026
but if she's
gonna attack me,

17:20.093 --> 17:21.160
she's  with
the wrong person.

17:21.228 --> 17:22.362
<i>My chicken has to be ready.</i>

17:22.430 --> 17:23.996
<i>That's all that I said.</i>

17:24.064 --> 17:25.699
<i>This is why I've never</i>
<i>been a team player</i>

17:25.766 --> 17:27.165
from the beginning...
Everybody else

17:27.233 --> 17:28.568
pretends to be
a team player,

17:28.636 --> 17:30.136
but looks out
for their own self.

17:30.204 --> 17:32.704
<i>If that's all it is,</i>
<i>then I can look out for me.</i>

17:42.443 --> 17:43.943
<i>Okay, uh, listen.</i>

17:44.011 --> 17:46.645
<i>Never before have we</i>
<i>done something</i>

17:46.713 --> 17:49.782
as important as tonight's
charity event.

17:49.849 --> 17:51.750
<i>You will be supervising</i>

17:51.818 --> 17:53.552
two courses each.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.587
<i>So I'm gonna</i>
<i>use this service to figure out</i>

17:55.655 --> 17:59.157
which five
deserve the black jacket.

18:00.894 --> 18:02.393
Oh, God.
<i>Okay?</i>

18:02.461 --> 18:03.728
Get on your stations.
Let's go.

18:05.130 --> 18:06.531
I'm in shock.

18:06.598 --> 18:08.299
We're, like,
one dinner service

18:08.366 --> 18:09.667
away from black jackets.

18:09.735 --> 18:11.068
If this doesn't
motivate us,

18:11.136 --> 18:12.637
I don't know
what else will.

18:12.704 --> 18:14.539
You about ready to win?
'Cause I am.

18:14.606 --> 18:17.207
For everyone, you have to be
elite to wear this black jacket.

18:17.275 --> 18:18.975
Cream always rises
to the top,

18:19.043 --> 18:20.977
and now, this is my time
to show what I can do.

18:21.045 --> 18:22.312
James...
Yes, chef?

18:22.379 --> 18:23.880
Please welcome
our special guests

18:23.948 --> 18:25.081
<i>into Hell's Kitchen.</i> 
Yes, chef.

18:25.149 --> 18:25.949
<i>Let's go.</i>

18:31.055 --> 18:33.256
For the first time in
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> history,

18:33.324 --> 18:35.324
the restaurant is closed
for a black tie event

18:35.391 --> 18:37.025
honoring guests
who've contributed

18:37.093 --> 18:39.995
a combined $3 million
to charity.

18:40.063 --> 18:41.730
I'd like to say
a personal thank you

18:41.798 --> 18:43.031
on the untold support
for charity.

18:43.099 --> 18:44.299
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:44.367 --> 18:45.601
The Red Team will be cooking

18:45.669 --> 18:47.135
for donors to the American
cancer society

18:47.203 --> 18:49.004
while the Blue Team
will be cooking

18:49.072 --> 18:51.172
for donors to
the American humane association.

18:51.239 --> 18:52.640
Now I'm getting nervous.

18:54.242 --> 18:55.577
Let me say a prayer for us.

18:55.644 --> 18:56.578
We need a lot of prayers.

18:56.645 --> 18:58.245
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:58.313 --> 19:00.181
<i>if you'd like</i>
<i>to be seated for dinner...</i>

19:00.248 --> 19:01.616
 <i>Guys, they're</i>
<i>sitting now, okay?</i>

19:01.684 --> 19:02.750
All right.
Let's do it, boys.

19:02.818 --> 19:04.218
Okay, here we go.

19:04.286 --> 19:05.619
<i>Elizabeth,</i>
<i>you're in charge.</i>

19:05.687 --> 19:06.687
This is your moment.
Yes, chef.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.088
<i>I want to hear</i> you.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.756
12 scallops to the window.

19:09.824 --> 19:11.592
Seven minutes, chef.
<i>Let's go.</i>

19:11.659 --> 19:14.695
I'm in a really stressful
situation right now.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.697
Looking out into
the dining room

19:16.764 --> 19:19.099
and seeing
the cancer society there,

19:19.166 --> 19:20.934
this is taking it
to a whole next level.

19:21.002 --> 19:22.101
<i>Just out of interest,</i>

19:22.168 --> 19:23.569
why aren't two of you

19:23.637 --> 19:25.437
putting the scallops
in the Pan?

19:25.506 --> 19:26.506
Elise, can you put
scallops in the Pan?

19:26.573 --> 19:27.640
Come on!

19:27.708 --> 19:29.241
Come on, Elizabeth.
Yes, chef!

19:29.309 --> 19:31.309
Delegate, come on.
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

19:31.745 --> 19:33.178
Okay, Blue Team.
Here we go.

19:33.246 --> 19:34.514
Paul, you're in charge.
Yes, chef.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.015
<i>Step up to the plate</i>

19:36.082 --> 19:37.182
<i>and get your team</i>
<i>to the window.</i>

19:37.250 --> 19:38.550
Yes, chef.
<i>Okay?</i>

19:38.618 --> 19:40.318
12 scallops away,
table 20.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.620
<i>12 scallops to the window.</i> 
<i>Let's go.</i>

19:41.687 --> 19:43.388
Six minutes
to the windows, guys!

19:43.455 --> 19:44.689
Six minutes heard.
Tommy, start the salad.

19:44.757 --> 19:46.491
I am personally
responsible tonight

19:46.559 --> 19:48.192
for the first course,
the scallops.

19:48.260 --> 19:49.293
Will, start flipping
those scallops.

19:49.361 --> 19:50.729
Yep, you got it.

19:50.796 --> 19:52.463
I've done tastings
before like this.

19:52.532 --> 19:53.797
I understand that
it's very important for us

19:53.865 --> 19:55.533
to get off to a strong start.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.401
So I'm gonna take control
of the situation.

19:57.468 --> 19:58.335
<i>Paul, is that</i>
<i>what you want?</i>

19:58.403 --> 19:59.369
Yes.
You're happy?

19:59.437 --> 20:00.771
Yes.
Okay, good.

20:00.839 --> 20:02.339
Everything is good.
Service, please, let's go.

20:02.407 --> 20:04.241
Don't go
until I see them.

20:04.308 --> 20:05.509
More curry on there.
Touch more on there.

20:05.577 --> 20:06.877
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:06.945 --> 20:08.345
Dirty plate here.
Come on, guys, please.

20:08.413 --> 20:09.379
Finesse.

20:09.447 --> 20:11.614
Oh, who dressed that salad?

20:11.682 --> 20:13.082
<i>Tommy!</i>

20:13.150 --> 20:14.784
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

20:14.852 --> 20:17.286
There's water in the whole
salad, Tommy!

20:17.354 --> 20:19.155
I wanted to smack Tommy
in the face, dude!

20:19.222 --> 20:21.024
It's Greens and olive oil.

20:21.091 --> 20:22.992
Shake 'em off,
put 'em in the bowl.

20:23.060 --> 20:23.960
That's it.

20:24.028 --> 20:26.261
Come on, guys!

20:26.328 --> 20:28.129
While the blue
team rushes to recover

20:28.197 --> 20:29.364
from Tommy's sloppy salad,

20:29.432 --> 20:31.033
over in the red kitchen...

20:31.100 --> 20:33.735
<i>I'm dropping cauliflower</i>
<i>Elizabeth, yep.</i>

20:33.803 --> 20:35.470
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

20:35.538 --> 20:37.372
The women turn
to Elizabeth for guidance

20:37.440 --> 20:39.041
on the first of her
two courses.

20:39.108 --> 20:40.341
<i>Elizabeth.</i> 
Yep.

20:40.409 --> 20:42.710
Elizabeth's job
is to be a leader,

20:42.778 --> 20:44.879
speak up, and tell me
what to do.

20:44.947 --> 20:46.380
How long till the window,
you think?

20:46.448 --> 20:47.782
But it's dead.

20:47.849 --> 20:49.316
It's like crickets.
There's no response.

20:49.384 --> 20:51.118
I'm not gonna let us
go down tonight.

20:51.186 --> 20:52.787
They go in two minutes.

20:52.854 --> 20:54.121
<i>You want me to start plating?</i>

20:54.189 --> 20:55.522
<i>Yep, go.</i>

20:55.591 --> 20:57.624
Elizabeth has zero qualities
as a leader.

20:57.692 --> 21:00.126
Jennifer and I did her whole
first course for her.

21:00.194 --> 21:01.194
Go. Very nice.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.262
Red Team, go.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.231
Blue Team, service.
Go.

21:05.299 --> 21:07.500
Paul and
Elizabeth's first courses

21:07.568 --> 21:09.603
have made their way
out to the dining room.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.938
And tonight's V.I.P. guests...

21:12.006 --> 21:13.339
This is very good.

21:13.407 --> 21:14.773
It's delicious.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.075
Are giving rave reviews.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.443
But back in the red kitchen...

21:18.511 --> 21:19.712
Elizabeth.
<i>Yep?</i>

21:19.779 --> 21:21.113
<i>Come here.</i> 
<i>Where's the voice?</i>

21:21.180 --> 21:22.848
There is a harsh critic.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.049
Where's the leadership?
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

21:24.117 --> 21:25.517
<i>You've got</i>
<i>one more course left.</i>

21:25.585 --> 21:26.785
<i>Own it!</i> 
Yes, chef!

21:26.853 --> 21:28.186
Chef obviously didn't like

21:28.254 --> 21:30.287
the way that I was leading.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.923
So when my other
course goes out,

21:31.991 --> 21:34.258
I want everything
to be perfect.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.427
So my chicken's working.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.728
You dropped your chickens.
Yeah.

21:37.795 --> 21:38.962
I'm trying to figure out

21:39.030 --> 21:40.430
why the chicken's in already.

21:40.498 --> 21:42.232
We still have two courses
before that.

21:42.299 --> 21:44.300
Let's go.
Next course.

21:44.368 --> 21:45.602
<i>12 risotto.</i> 
Yes, chef.

21:45.670 --> 21:46.903
<i>Jennifer, you and I</i>

21:46.971 --> 21:48.538
are gonna work
risottos together.

21:48.606 --> 21:50.173
<i>Elizabeth,</i>
<i>I'm gonna give you</i>

21:50.241 --> 21:51.608
a countdown when to drop
my calamari.

21:51.676 --> 21:52.642
Thank you.

21:52.709 --> 21:54.977
I'm responsible for risotto,

21:55.045 --> 21:56.578
and I plan to execute it
with all my heart.

21:56.647 --> 21:57.613
That's how I feel about it.

21:57.681 --> 21:59.148
Walking.

21:59.215 --> 22:01.350
Last dinner service
didn't go according to plan.

22:01.417 --> 22:03.185
Let's go, ladies!
We got this!

22:03.253 --> 22:04.920
And I'm gonna show
and prove tonight

22:04.988 --> 22:06.155
that I can step up my game.

22:06.222 --> 22:08.157
Don't send anything.

22:08.224 --> 22:09.624
<i>Beautiful.</i>

22:09.692 --> 22:11.926
Go.
Thank you, chef.

22:11.994 --> 22:14.062
Thanks to strong
leadership from Elise,

22:14.130 --> 22:15.596
the red diners have received
their risotto

22:15.665 --> 22:16.965
exactly on schedule.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.067
<i>Really creamy.</i> 
<i>Really good.</i>

22:19.135 --> 22:20.301
And the Red Team...

22:20.369 --> 22:21.670
Jennifer, let's go.

22:21.737 --> 22:23.404
<i>Cappellini course.</i> 
Yes, chef.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.905
Is moving on
to their third course.

22:24.973 --> 22:26.373
Meanwhile, over in
the blue kitchen...

22:26.440 --> 22:28.075
How long?
Six minutes.

22:28.143 --> 22:29.242
Six minutes?

22:29.310 --> 22:30.878
Yeah.

22:30.945 --> 22:33.113
Tommy's risotto
is still in the Pan.

22:33.181 --> 22:35.849
If it's six minutes,
why are you finishing it?

22:35.917 --> 22:37.384
I'm not,
I'm mixing the parmesan.

22:37.451 --> 22:38.819
But that's
finishing the rice.

22:38.887 --> 22:39.820
<i>Unless you're ready</i>
<i>to finish,</i>

22:39.888 --> 22:41.420
don't add the parmesan.

22:41.488 --> 22:43.156
Yo, I got it.
Just let me make it, bro.

22:43.223 --> 22:44.924
It'll taste good
when I'm done, all right?

22:44.992 --> 22:46.425
And if it's not,
tear me a new one.

22:46.493 --> 22:48.260
<i>I'm not gonna let you...</i> 
Let me do my thing.

22:48.328 --> 22:49.929
I don't like other
people's input in my cooking.

22:49.997 --> 22:51.164
He's telling me to do all this
and this and this different.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.631
When I really just wanted
to get away

22:52.700 --> 22:54.167
and let me finish
the risotto myself.

22:54.234 --> 22:56.268
I'm not gonna let you
do something that's wrong.

22:56.336 --> 22:58.070
<i>I'm not gonna</i>
<i>get yelled at by chef</i>

22:58.137 --> 22:58.904
<i>for you doing</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

22:58.971 --> 23:00.338
You won't.
I will.

23:00.406 --> 23:04.142
Because I'm directing
this rice output right here.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.044
There's a right way and
a wrong way to make rice,

23:06.112 --> 23:07.545
plain and simple.

23:07.613 --> 23:09.414
But you know what?
You wanna drive the bus

23:09.481 --> 23:10.682
the way you wanna
drive the bus, man,

23:10.750 --> 23:11.883
here's the steering wheel...
Drive away.

23:11.951 --> 23:13.050
How long, Tommy?

23:13.118 --> 23:14.384
Comin' up right now!

23:14.452 --> 23:15.753
Do all three
taste the same?

23:15.821 --> 23:17.487
<i>Bring the pans down.</i>

23:17.555 --> 23:19.790
They do taste... bring
all three down, I said!

23:19.858 --> 23:21.092
<i>Every single one.</i> 
<i>They're dead on.</i>

23:21.159 --> 23:22.026
<i>I tasted each one.</i>

23:26.664 --> 23:29.099
You have three different
tastes there!

23:29.166 --> 23:31.101
What's  complicated?

23:31.168 --> 23:32.902
Nothing, nothing.
<i>Nothing, chef.</i>

23:32.970 --> 23:33.903
<i>You put 'em all</i>
<i>in one large Pan,</i>

23:33.971 --> 23:34.838
you finish 'em
off together!

23:34.905 --> 23:35.872
Half in here.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.173
Mix 'em up.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.142
Now you got
all three in one, all right?

23:39.210 --> 23:40.910
You know, I should
have called it, 100%.

23:40.978 --> 23:42.612
You wanna be Mr. Man, bro,

23:42.679 --> 23:44.413
you gotta take the lumps
where the lumps come.

23:44.481 --> 23:45.614
<i>Paul, you got</i>
<i>the calamari?</i>

23:45.681 --> 23:47.116
<i>Come on, Tommy!</i>

23:47.183 --> 23:48.817
Right.
You guys are ready?

23:48.885 --> 23:49.985
Yeah,
I'm platin' 'em up, Tommy.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.419
Go, please.

23:51.487 --> 23:52.687
With a big assist from will,

23:52.756 --> 23:54.356
the risotto is now finally

23:54.423 --> 23:56.225
making it out
to the dining room.

23:56.292 --> 23:57.459
I love it.

23:57.526 --> 23:58.927
And the Blue Team

23:58.995 --> 24:00.095
is moving on
to course number three.

24:00.163 --> 24:01.262
<i>12 cappellini away,</i>
<i>will!</i>

24:01.329 --> 24:03.197
Yes, chef, 3 1/2 minutes
to the window.

24:03.265 --> 24:04.899
Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen,

24:04.967 --> 24:07.601
Jennifer's cappellini
is already headed to the pass.

24:07.669 --> 24:08.803
We need to move fast.
Okay.

24:14.810 --> 24:16.244
Do something, Elise.

24:16.311 --> 24:17.477
Yes, chef!

24:19.147 --> 24:21.014
Come on, coat that pasta,
Elizabeth.

24:21.082 --> 24:22.949
Toss it!

24:23.017 --> 24:24.851
It's a draw between
Elise and Elizabeth

24:24.919 --> 24:26.219
on who's the biggest
waste of space.

24:26.287 --> 24:28.021
Now.

24:28.089 --> 24:30.757
Elise, on the plate,
right now!

24:30.825 --> 24:31.858
You know what?
Seriously.

24:31.926 --> 24:33.793
I swear to God.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.661
You know what, Elise?
I helped you.

24:35.728 --> 24:37.329
Elise wasn't doing.

24:37.397 --> 24:38.664
She was just
standing there.

24:38.731 --> 24:39.698
Okay, these look okay?

24:39.766 --> 24:41.400
That one needs
more lobster.

24:41.467 --> 24:42.902
<i>Don't send that out</i>
<i>without more lobster.</i>

24:42.969 --> 24:44.636
Elizabeth, you just did
everything half-assed,

24:44.704 --> 24:45.570
if you want me
to be honest.

24:47.908 --> 24:49.040
Elise, give me
your opinion.

24:49.108 --> 24:50.074
It looks good.

24:50.142 --> 24:51.075
"It looks good"?

24:51.143 --> 24:52.543
"It looks good!"

24:52.611 --> 24:53.812
Look at this one
with four little bits

24:53.879 --> 24:55.013
of lobster on it,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.182
12 on there,
5 on there!

24:57.249 --> 24:59.550
Look at that
and that!

25:02.688 --> 25:04.388
I'm so embarrassed!

25:04.456 --> 25:05.755
<i>Come on!</i>

25:05.824 --> 25:07.524
Jennifer, what do you
want me to do?

25:07.591 --> 25:08.826
What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

25:08.893 --> 25:10.893
<i>Are you trying</i>
<i>to sabotage me?</i>

25:17.237 --> 25:19.104
Tonight, Hell's
Kitchen has been closed

25:19.171 --> 25:21.239
for a special V.I.P.
charity event.

25:21.306 --> 25:23.942
But three courses
into a six-course dinner...

25:24.009 --> 25:26.544
Look at that!
And that!

25:28.114 --> 25:29.814
Jennifer is looking for help

25:29.882 --> 25:30.915
plating her
lobster cappellini.

25:30.983 --> 25:31.883
<i>What the hell</i>

25:31.951 --> 25:33.051
is wrong with you guys?

25:33.119 --> 25:34.752
Trying to sabotage me?

25:34.819 --> 25:36.220
And is completely disappointed

25:36.287 --> 25:37.420
by her teammates.

25:37.488 --> 25:38.655
I  Helped
both of you.

25:38.723 --> 25:39.790
What do you
want me to do?

25:39.858 --> 25:40.724
Why would I try to sabotage?

25:40.792 --> 25:42.259
I didn't have to sabotage.

25:42.326 --> 25:44.061
Jen's  up so bad
on her own.

25:44.129 --> 25:45.695
Do you want me to put
this up there? Yes!

25:45.764 --> 25:46.997
Okay! Well, you have
to give me direction,

25:47.065 --> 25:48.098
like you're just...

25:48.166 --> 25:49.199
You know what, Elise?

25:49.267 --> 25:50.634
Back off.

25:50.701 --> 25:51.934
While the women struggle

25:52.002 --> 25:53.369
to work as a team...

25:53.436 --> 25:54.270
Good.
Get out of here.

25:54.337 --> 25:55.371
What?

25:55.438 --> 25:56.472
Over in the blue kitchen,

25:56.539 --> 25:57.940
thanks to will...

25:58.008 --> 25:59.809
Good job, guys.
You're all doing a great job.

25:59.877 --> 26:00.609
The Blue Team has come together.

26:00.677 --> 26:01.978
Beautiful!

26:02.045 --> 26:03.146
<i>Blue Team,</i>
<i>that's a great way</i>

26:03.213 --> 26:03.946
<i>to do a course.</i>

26:04.014 --> 26:05.915
Serve, please, let's go!

26:05.983 --> 26:07.883
And their third
course is making its way out

26:07.950 --> 26:10.152
to the humane association table
in a timely manner.

26:10.219 --> 26:12.587
The lobster is nicely cooked,
and the tomato's fresh.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.389
Very nice dinner so far.

26:14.456 --> 26:16.391
After much difficulty...

26:16.458 --> 26:18.426
That's the longest plating
of pasta I've ever seen.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.661
Come on!

26:19.728 --> 26:21.163
The Red Team is finally

26:21.230 --> 26:22.264
sending their third course.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.430
Go!

26:23.498 --> 26:24.932
To the V.I.P. guests

26:25.000 --> 26:26.934
at the American cancer society
table.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.338
Paul, 12 stunning chicken.

26:31.406 --> 26:32.339
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

26:32.407 --> 26:34.108
This is what we're gonna do.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.709
Will, I'm gonna put
the chickens in the oven.

26:35.777 --> 26:37.444
You're gonna slice.
Bring me up the sauce.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.679
Tommy, you're gonna warm up
the garnishes for me.

26:38.746 --> 26:40.079
I'm gonna start
doing the puree.

26:40.147 --> 26:41.514
<i>All right?</i> 
Okay.

26:41.581 --> 26:43.683
While Paul takes complete
charge of the Blue Team,

26:43.750 --> 26:45.985
over the red kitchen...
<i>Where's the chicken?</i>

26:46.053 --> 26:47.787
Elizabeth is
ready with her chicken.

26:47.855 --> 26:49.689
That's ready to go now.

26:49.756 --> 26:51.124
But it's
just a little too soon.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.591
<i>Okay, chef.</i>

26:52.659 --> 26:53.726
Your customers are still
eating the cappellini.

26:55.061 --> 26:56.795
It is delicious,
isn't it?

26:56.863 --> 26:58.430
So I'll let them rest
right now.

26:58.497 --> 27:01.399
<i>They're ready</i>
<i>perfectly now.</i>

27:01.467 --> 27:03.202
I wanted to give them
time to rest.

27:03.269 --> 27:04.870
Oh,.

27:04.938 --> 27:06.404
<i>You're not listening.</i>

27:06.472 --> 27:08.040
You're five minutes
too early.

27:08.107 --> 27:09.174
<i>There're ready</i>

27:09.242 --> 27:10.842
perfect now!

27:10.909 --> 27:13.711
Yes, chef, I-I just wanted
to give them time to rest.

27:13.778 --> 27:14.912
Oh, God.

27:16.315 --> 27:18.682
God, Elizabeth.
Wake up.

27:18.750 --> 27:19.817
We want to serve them
at their best,

27:19.885 --> 27:20.952
which is now.

27:21.019 --> 27:22.320
Okay, chef.

27:22.387 --> 27:23.721
<i>James, please,</i>
<i>clear the plates.</i>

27:23.788 --> 27:25.056
All right, chef.
Man.

27:25.123 --> 27:26.890
Clear.

27:26.958 --> 27:27.858
I do apologize.

27:31.329 --> 27:33.596
Uh, I need to warm up
my squash right now.

27:33.664 --> 27:35.365
Get them doing it
for you!

27:35.432 --> 27:36.967
I need to warm up
this squash right now.

27:37.034 --> 27:39.802
Oh, man.
Oh, man.

27:39.871 --> 27:41.637
Elizabeth's just scatterbrained.

27:41.705 --> 27:43.672
She was just like,
"uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!"

27:43.740 --> 27:45.341
Like she does
every dinner service.

27:45.408 --> 27:47.676
Slice on the board!

27:47.744 --> 27:49.745
But now, when
you're messing up cooking

27:49.812 --> 27:50.846
<i>and</i> you're not communicating,
then now what?

27:50.914 --> 27:52.014
Now what?

27:52.082 --> 27:53.082
Now what?

27:53.149 --> 27:54.884
Off, guys.

27:54.951 --> 27:56.318
As Elizabeth's
chicken makes its way

27:56.386 --> 27:58.120
to the dining room...

27:58.188 --> 27:59.420
Back in the blue kitchen,

27:59.488 --> 28:00.922
Paul's chicken...

28:00.990 --> 28:02.323
Go, please.

28:02.391 --> 28:03.591
Is ready as well.

28:07.529 --> 28:09.162
Now, back
in the red kitchen...

28:09.230 --> 28:10.431
Okay, 12 Wellington away.
How long?

28:10.499 --> 28:12.199
Seven minutes.
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:12.267 --> 28:14.167
Seven minutes to the window.
Yes, chef.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.069
Elise is in the driver's
seat for course number five.

28:16.137 --> 28:19.740
Are you gonna want help
with, um, the Wellingtons?

28:19.808 --> 28:21.842
No, I don't want
my Wellingtons touched.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.511
I don't want any of them chicks
touchin' my Wellingtons.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.579
Because, at this point
in the game,

28:26.647 --> 28:28.247
I don't trust neither one of
them as far as I can throw 'em,

28:28.315 --> 28:30.049
and I can't pick
neither one of 'em up.

28:30.117 --> 28:31.651
So you need
to tell everybody

28:31.719 --> 28:32.819
what you want them to do.
I am.

28:32.887 --> 28:34.754
I want you
to do my sides.

28:34.822 --> 28:36.289
Because you're really,
really good at that.

28:36.356 --> 28:37.724
Thank you.
Thank you.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.458
So what do you need me
to do and when?

28:39.526 --> 28:43.061
Um...You can heat up
the red wine jus.

28:43.129 --> 28:44.897
Heat up my sauce
that's already in a pot.

28:44.964 --> 28:46.164
That's what you can
do for me,

28:46.232 --> 28:47.332
and stir these potatoes.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.801
That's it.

28:48.868 --> 28:50.869
Please don't burn it,
but I know you won't.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.838
While Elise has no trouble

28:52.906 --> 28:54.906
taking charge
of her Wellingtons...

28:54.973 --> 28:57.141
Over in the blue kitchen...

28:57.208 --> 28:58.075
Tommy, how do
you wanna do this?

29:00.312 --> 29:02.146
Oh, my God.

29:02.213 --> 29:04.281
It's Tommy's
turn to take the lead.

29:04.349 --> 29:06.651
But Paul and will
are getting almost no guidance.

29:06.718 --> 29:08.619
Tell us what to do then.
You're leading us.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.054
What do you wanna do?

29:10.121 --> 29:11.621
Tommy is a deer
in the headlights.

29:11.689 --> 29:13.857
He's always saying he's
so focused, he's so focused.

29:13.925 --> 29:15.459
He's  lost.

29:15.526 --> 29:16.760
Hey, come here, you.

29:16.828 --> 29:18.795
Risotto was a  disaster.

29:18.863 --> 29:20.229
<i>Wellington, get a grip.</i>

29:20.297 --> 29:21.932
Yeah, I got it.
Wake up.

29:21.999 --> 29:24.167
I wanna hear you,
and you leading your team!

29:24.234 --> 29:26.234
<i>Absolutely!</i> 
<i>All right!</i>

29:27.737 --> 29:29.204
Will, you put up plates,
followed by me.

29:29.272 --> 29:30.773
<i>I knock down the puree.</i>

29:30.841 --> 29:31.807
Paul, you tail me
with the carrots.

29:31.875 --> 29:32.775
<i>You put down the carrots</i>

29:32.843 --> 29:34.409
while you're slicing the meat.

29:34.478 --> 29:36.411
<i>And in turn, you will</i>
<i>bring up the meat.</i>

29:36.480 --> 29:38.013
I will follow you with the sauce.
All right.

29:38.081 --> 29:39.414
<i>One of you guys</i>
<i>follow me with a plate wipe.</i>

29:39.483 --> 29:41.116
That's how it's gonna go.
Exactly.

29:41.184 --> 29:43.050
I'm definitely more tuned in
than people think I am.

29:43.118 --> 29:44.652
Everyone thinks
I daydream a lot.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.954
But, uh, it's really
just me concentrating.

29:46.021 --> 29:47.455
I do have a lazy eye, too.

29:47.523 --> 29:49.090
So if I'm looking
at the ceiling,

29:49.157 --> 29:50.358
uh, I'm probably actually
looking at what I'm doing.

29:50.425 --> 29:51.593
Plates a-risin'.

29:51.660 --> 29:53.160
These are
lookin' great, guys.

29:53.228 --> 29:55.530
Very nice, Tommy.
Great job.

29:55.598 --> 29:56.631
Go, please.
Finally.

29:56.699 --> 29:58.199
Hey, you redeemed yourself.

29:58.266 --> 29:59.299
Thank you, chef.
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:01.235 --> 30:02.569
This is good.

30:02.637 --> 30:03.704
We ready?

30:03.771 --> 30:05.071
<i>Make sure it's perfect.</i>

30:05.139 --> 30:06.406
These are perfect.

30:06.474 --> 30:07.941
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's swap.</i>

30:08.009 --> 30:08.942
Carrots right on top
of the potatoes.

30:09.010 --> 30:10.110
Got it.
Good.

30:10.177 --> 30:11.277
Elise, go slice
the Wellington.

30:11.345 --> 30:12.546
<i>I'll finish this.</i>

30:12.614 --> 30:13.614
2:00, and three carrots
on top.

30:17.050 --> 30:21.587
Pan down.
Work with two hands.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.122
All of you, come here.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.323
<i>Come here.</i> 
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

30:24.391 --> 30:25.925
Now,.

30:25.993 --> 30:27.894
Just taste that.
All of you.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.261
Hurry up.
Jump in, hurry up.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.595
Just taste that.

30:30.663 --> 30:31.963
What does that need?
Salt.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.431
What does that need?
Salt.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.799
What does it...
Come here, you.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.668
Why? Why you doing this
on my night tonight?

30:36.736 --> 30:38.302
Why?

30:38.370 --> 30:40.071
<i>This is your course.</i> 
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

30:40.139 --> 30:42.206
You know it needs seasoning.
Yes, chef.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.642
What is going on here?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.443
You wanna talk about sabotage?

30:45.511 --> 30:46.844
Jennifer and Elizabeth
knew they were lacking

30:46.912 --> 30:48.278
leadership abilities,

30:48.346 --> 30:49.813
so what better way
to  it up

30:49.881 --> 30:51.381
than to try to sabotage
my ,

30:51.449 --> 30:53.083
so they don't look as bad.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.085
Is this on purpose?
No, I'm telling you...

30:55.153 --> 30:56.420
I'm not laughing.
I am not laughing.

30:56.487 --> 30:57.755
<i>I'm not laughing.</i>

30:57.822 --> 30:59.590
I can't believe she said that.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.926
To  question
my  ethics?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.225
Please.

31:03.293 --> 31:04.928
Let's go!
I'm walkin'.

31:04.995 --> 31:06.262
Come on, we already made 'em
wait long enough.

31:06.329 --> 31:07.263
Go.

31:07.330 --> 31:08.497
She's not even that good.

31:08.566 --> 31:09.999
Why would  sabotage

31:10.067 --> 31:11.434
someone I don't think
is  that good?

31:11.501 --> 31:13.469
Wipe the rims, please.

31:13.537 --> 31:15.004
Go, please.

31:15.072 --> 31:16.773
They're beautifully cooked,
those Wellingtons.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.807
Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.876
- Now that the v.
- I.P. Diners on both sides

31:20.944 --> 31:22.644
are enjoying
their lamb Wellingtons...

31:22.712 --> 31:24.446
That's delicious.

31:24.513 --> 31:26.147
The teams
have just one course left

31:26.215 --> 31:27.683
to complete dinner service.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.585
Let's go...
12 stunning tatin away.

31:29.652 --> 31:31.119
12 tatin, chef!

31:31.187 --> 31:32.353
<i>Three minutes</i>
<i>to the window, chef.</i>

31:32.421 --> 31:33.555
Three minutes.
<i>Heard.</i>

31:33.623 --> 31:35.089
Okay, so Elizabeth,

31:35.156 --> 31:36.991
do you want to do
fritters for me?

31:37.059 --> 31:38.459
<i>Yes.</i> What do you want me to do?

31:38.526 --> 31:40.160
<i>Sautee the apples.</i> 
Okay.

31:40.228 --> 31:42.296
<i>And the apples</i>
<i>should be cooked through.</i>

31:42.363 --> 31:44.531
While Jennifer delegates
dessert responsibilities...

31:44.600 --> 31:45.800
 <i>Chef, I'm
clearing</i> <i>their salads.</i>

31:45.867 --> 31:47.001
<i>Thank you.</i>

31:47.069 --> 31:48.469
The blue V.I.P. table

31:48.536 --> 31:49.837
has finished
their lamb Wellingtons.

31:49.905 --> 31:51.304
Service, please.
Line up. Let's go.

31:51.371 --> 31:52.906
And the blue kitchen...

31:52.974 --> 31:54.407
Fritters are ready
to rock.

31:54.475 --> 31:55.141
Is ready to send out

31:55.209 --> 31:56.309
will's apple tatin.

31:56.376 --> 31:57.477
Let's go.
Very nice, will. Go.

31:57.544 --> 31:58.878
Thank you, chef.
Well done.

31:58.946 --> 32:00.379
12 tatin away.

32:00.447 --> 32:02.115
All on Blue Team.

32:02.182 --> 32:03.449
<i>Switch everything off,</i>
<i>please.</i>

32:03.517 --> 32:05.051
We worked as a team today.

32:05.119 --> 32:06.619
We all had motivation.
We all had drive,

32:06.686 --> 32:07.686
especially for tonight
because of the charities.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.622
It feels great.

32:09.689 --> 32:12.189
While the blue
diners dive into dessert...

32:13.593 --> 32:15.393
Back in the red kitchen...

32:15.461 --> 32:17.395
You start that way.
I'll start this way. Yep.

32:17.463 --> 32:19.098
The women are
still slowly plating.

32:21.768 --> 32:23.134
The apples are raw.

32:23.201 --> 32:24.102
Just touch that inside.

32:25.504 --> 32:27.839
Off, will you?

32:27.906 --> 32:30.074
Can we get the apples
back in the Pan?!

32:30.142 --> 32:31.475
Okay.
Okay.

32:31.543 --> 32:33.845
I had Elise cook one
Pan of apples.

32:33.912 --> 32:36.180
And it's raw.

32:36.248 --> 32:37.949
This  bitch
will do anything

32:38.017 --> 32:39.883
- to get rid of  me...
- Anything.

32:39.951 --> 32:41.317
You put them on.
You put them on.

32:41.385 --> 32:42.485
Not one of you
could tell her

32:42.553 --> 32:43.754
<i>they're undercooked.</i>

32:43.821 --> 32:46.056
You don't care
for each other!

32:46.124 --> 32:48.792
I work  hard
with them, for them.

32:48.860 --> 32:50.661
I make sure you guys
are  ready.

32:50.728 --> 32:52.262
I did exactly
what you told me to do.

32:52.329 --> 32:53.496
Elise...

32:53.564 --> 32:55.097
Are you serious?

32:55.165 --> 32:56.699
Yep, this is for the whole
mashed potato thing.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.367
<i>You know what, Elise?</i>

32:58.434 --> 32:59.401
<i>You're as petty</i>
<i>as can it be.</i>

32:59.469 --> 33:00.770
You know what?

33:00.837 --> 33:02.271
I've kept my mouth shut
for a long time.

33:02.338 --> 33:04.073
I'm not keeping it shut
anymore.

33:04.141 --> 33:05.374
<i>War is on.</i> 
What?

33:12.225 --> 33:13.926
Tonight, Hell's
Kitchen is playing host

33:13.994 --> 33:15.594
to a special charity dinner

33:15.662 --> 33:18.297
honoring donors
who have given $3 million.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.900
And with a dining room
full of V.I.P. guests,

33:20.967 --> 33:22.333
the Red Team...

33:22.401 --> 33:24.002
I've kept my mouth shut
for a long time.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.436
I'm not keeping it shut
anymore.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.839
<i>War is on.</i> 
What?

33:27.907 --> 33:29.740
Has completely unraveled

33:29.809 --> 33:31.176
over raw apples.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.977
I don't need your help,
thank you.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.179
I'm gonna help anyway.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.347
<i>I really don't want it.</i>

33:36.415 --> 33:38.115
Is that how it's gonna be?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.817
Jen's blaming me,
trying to make me look bad.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.319
She's gonna regret not making
a friend of me.

33:42.386 --> 33:44.754
Go, please!

33:44.823 --> 33:47.791
The little apple fritter
is fantastic.

33:50.494 --> 33:51.328
Anything to say?

33:53.997 --> 33:55.397
We suck, yes.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.305
Congratulations, Blue Team.

34:02.372 --> 34:04.240
<i>You got</i>
<i>your  together.</i>

34:04.308 --> 34:06.342
<i>Which was the opposite</i>
<i>to what the Red Team did.</i>

34:06.409 --> 34:07.910
<i>Red Team,</i>

34:07.978 --> 34:09.045
you got off
to a much better start

34:09.112 --> 34:10.011
than Blue Team.

34:10.079 --> 34:11.411
<i>But then everything</i>

34:11.480 --> 34:12.612
<i>came crashing down</i>

34:12.681 --> 34:15.283
on the cappellini, Jennifer.

34:15.351 --> 34:17.284
<i>You were supposed to lead,</i>

34:17.353 --> 34:18.686
<i>show the competition</i>

34:18.754 --> 34:19.987
what you're made of.

34:20.056 --> 34:22.991
<i>If I go home tonight...</i>

34:23.059 --> 34:24.792
<i>I go home</i>
<i>with my integrity.</i>

34:24.860 --> 34:27.360
I would never  sabotage
anyone on this team.

34:27.428 --> 34:28.661
I had your  backs.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.164
Sabotage? No.

34:30.232 --> 34:31.866
<i>I was the one who tried</i>
<i>to rally the team.</i>

34:31.933 --> 34:33.234
I really wanted
to  win tonight.

34:33.301 --> 34:35.301
I'm more of a leader than
both of you put together.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.103
<i>You know it's true.</i> 
Oh, right.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.938
What I should have done
is take over everything.

34:39.005 --> 34:40.172
Are you kidding me?
<i>That's what</i> <i>i should have done.</i>

34:40.241 --> 34:41.775
My performance was not
as bad as you two's,

34:41.842 --> 34:42.876
so don't even
start.

34:42.943 --> 34:43.909
<i>Ladies!</i>

34:43.978 --> 34:45.245
The only thing I can say

34:45.312 --> 34:46.679
<i>to all three of you is,</i>

34:46.748 --> 34:48.248
get ready to plead
for your life.

34:50.049 --> 34:51.049
<i>'Cause tonight,</i>

34:51.117 --> 34:52.485
<i>all three of you</i>

34:52.552 --> 34:54.018
<i>can be leaving</i>
<i>this competition.</i>

34:54.087 --> 34:55.152
Now  off!

35:02.028 --> 35:04.563
Elise is used
to living in Elise's world.

35:04.631 --> 35:06.297
In her delusional state,

35:06.365 --> 35:08.366
she thinks she's
the leader of the team

35:08.434 --> 35:11.335
and all this complete
psychotic.

35:11.404 --> 35:12.704
Once she's gone,

35:12.772 --> 35:15.172
I will shine
all the way to the end.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.509
I'll be  damned
if I have to go home over her.

35:17.576 --> 35:19.644
She's been up
five  times.

35:19.712 --> 35:22.212
<i>Give me a break.</i>

35:22.280 --> 35:23.714
I have been so much
stronger

35:23.782 --> 35:25.315
than her
for so long.

35:25.383 --> 35:26.650
Gonna sit there and tell me
you're the leader?

35:26.718 --> 35:27.851
Are you kidding me?

35:27.919 --> 35:29.019
What the
was that?

35:29.086 --> 35:30.120
Where does
that come from?

35:30.187 --> 35:31.422
Elise is one
of those people

35:31.489 --> 35:32.556
that throw you
under the bus

35:32.624 --> 35:33.957
and drive over you

35:34.025 --> 35:35.492
and back up three times.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.560
You know what, Elise?
Sit and rotate.

35:37.628 --> 35:38.661
Ohh!

35:38.729 --> 35:40.296
<i>What happened over there?</i>

35:40.363 --> 35:41.096
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to talk about it.</i>

35:41.164 --> 35:42.364
<i>You're safe.</i>

35:42.433 --> 35:44.033
<i>Why the</i>
<i>do you care?</i>

35:44.100 --> 35:45.935
I don't feel like I can
trust anybody here.

35:46.002 --> 35:48.037
They're all looking
to backstab you.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.540
They're all looking to make
themselves look better than you.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.742
There's no reason I should be
going up tonight!

35:52.810 --> 35:54.108
I'm pissed!

35:54.176 --> 35:55.477
<i>Everything</i>
<i>that I had to cook</i>

35:55.545 --> 35:56.778
was perfect.

35:56.846 --> 35:58.447
Now I have to fight
for my life.

35:58.514 --> 36:00.248
Chef Ramsay's tired
of seeing my ass up there.

36:00.316 --> 36:02.651
And I could be going home
tonight when I don't deserve to.

36:02.718 --> 36:05.320
- Don't stress too hard.
- Are you  kidding me?

36:17.298 --> 36:18.632
Blue Team,

36:18.700 --> 36:20.901
<i>you gave me</i>
<i>a performance worthy</i>

36:20.969 --> 36:22.670
of a black jacket.

36:22.737 --> 36:23.771
<i>Will...</i>

36:23.839 --> 36:25.038
Congratulations.

36:25.106 --> 36:25.905
Thank you
very much, chef.

36:25.973 --> 36:26.906
Yeah. Continue.

36:26.974 --> 36:28.374
Thank you, chef.
Paul!

36:28.442 --> 36:29.809
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

36:29.877 --> 36:31.143
<i>You deserve it.</i> 
Thank you, chef.

36:31.211 --> 36:33.312
Tommy...

36:33.380 --> 36:35.281
A night of redemption!

36:35.349 --> 36:37.216
Yeah, good job. Yes?

36:37.284 --> 36:38.451
Thank you, chef.
Well done.

36:38.519 --> 36:40.453
<i>Okay.</i>

36:40.521 --> 36:42.354
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>step forward, please.</i>

36:42.421 --> 36:43.956
Good luck, girls.

36:47.827 --> 36:49.628
<i>I've got one question</i>
<i>for all three of you.</i>

36:49.696 --> 36:52.097
What in the hell
happened tonight?!

36:52.164 --> 36:53.264
<i>I felt that</i>

36:53.332 --> 36:54.766
leadership lacked tonight.

36:54.834 --> 36:55.934
No, I think it was more
communication.

36:56.002 --> 36:57.235
<i>More talking.</i>

36:57.303 --> 36:58.769
More working together,
teamwork.

36:58.837 --> 37:00.337
And that falls in leadership,

37:00.405 --> 37:01.706
it has nothing to do
with teamwork.

37:01.773 --> 37:02.940
<i>We were all</i>
<i>assigned courses.</i>

37:03.008 --> 37:04.274
And neither one of you
led your course!

37:04.342 --> 37:05.776
I led my course!
You led your course?

37:05.844 --> 37:06.978
Interesting.
<i>Yes!</i>

37:07.045 --> 37:08.613
<i>You know,</i>
<i>i can sit here and say</i>

37:08.680 --> 37:09.614
leadership.
That if he sends me home tonight,

37:09.681 --> 37:11.081
that I  worked hard

37:11.149 --> 37:12.917
for both of you.

37:12.985 --> 37:14.350
<i>That I  put</i>
<i>my heart and soul</i>

37:14.418 --> 37:15.685
for my  team.

37:15.753 --> 37:19.155
You can't say that.

37:19.223 --> 37:20.524
Can you lead a team?

37:20.591 --> 37:21.658
Can you listen?
Can you lead a team?

37:21.726 --> 37:22.859
Yes.
<i>You can cook?</i>

37:22.927 --> 37:24.260
And you can be
a team player?

37:24.328 --> 37:25.228
Why don't you shut up
for five seconds?

37:25.295 --> 37:26.462
<i>I'm not gonna shut up,</i>

37:26.531 --> 37:27.998
'cause I'm fighting
for my life right now!

37:28.065 --> 37:29.332
<i>And don't tell me that</i>
<i>leadership</i>

37:29.400 --> 37:29.932
<i>didn't lack</i>
<i>in the kitchen,</i>

37:30.000 --> 37:31.133
because it did!

37:31.200 --> 37:32.568
<i>And I should have</i>
<i>took over</i>

37:32.636 --> 37:33.802
all of that ,
but I didn't,

37:33.870 --> 37:35.370
because I wanted you
to shine with me!

37:35.438 --> 37:37.006
<i>No one respects you.</i>

37:37.073 --> 37:38.073
This is why you can't
be a leader.

37:39.676 --> 37:40.809
It's listening...

37:40.877 --> 37:42.778
To what goes on.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.280
<i>It's not about respect.</i> 
<i>It's about you're intimidating.</i>

37:45.348 --> 37:46.614
You don't listen.
<i>It's called</i> <i>intimidation.</i>

37:46.682 --> 37:48.716
This is exactly
what happens all day.

37:48.784 --> 37:50.251
This is what we've been
dealing with

37:50.318 --> 37:51.753
since the beginning.
Stop.

37:53.956 --> 37:56.624
<i>Elizabeth, tell my why</i>
<i>you think you should stay</i>

37:56.692 --> 37:57.892
in Hell's Kitchen.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.994
<i>I am a great cook,</i>
<i>chef.</i>

38:00.062 --> 38:01.395
<i>And it's all</i>
<i>that I think about.</i>

38:01.463 --> 38:03.163
I live it all day.

38:03.230 --> 38:05.732
 <i>And I wanna
be here</i> <i>till the end.</i>

38:05.800 --> 38:08.368
And I wanna cook my ass off
against great chefs.

38:08.436 --> 38:10.804
Jennifer...Tell me why

38:10.872 --> 38:12.906
you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

38:12.974 --> 38:14.240
<i>I know, every day,</i>
<i>you tell me I need confidence.</i>

38:14.308 --> 38:15.642
Me competing against
these people,

38:15.710 --> 38:17.110
would make me confident.

38:17.178 --> 38:18.844
<i>I need this.</i>

38:18.912 --> 38:20.880
'Cause I wanna compete
against the best.

38:20.948 --> 38:23.382
<i>Elise...</i> 
<i>Tell me why you think</i>

38:23.450 --> 38:24.617
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

38:24.685 --> 38:25.851
<i>I am a great cook,</i>

38:25.919 --> 38:27.119
and it takes more than
just being a great cook

38:27.187 --> 38:28.487
to run BLT Steak.

38:28.555 --> 38:30.189
You also have to be
a leader.

38:30.256 --> 38:32.391
<i>And I tried to rally</i>
<i>my team tonight.</i>

38:32.459 --> 38:34.693
I wanted to nail
this service.

38:37.129 --> 38:39.363
Okay.

38:39.431 --> 38:40.364
<i>This is a very</i>

38:40.432 --> 38:41.633
difficult decision.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.937
My decision is...

38:58.291 --> 39:00.325
While the entire Blue Team

39:00.393 --> 39:02.628
has already received
black jackets,

39:02.696 --> 39:05.096
the fate of the Red Team
hangs in the balance,

39:05.163 --> 39:08.099
and chef Ramsay must decide
who will join the black team

39:08.166 --> 39:09.701
and who will go home.

39:09.768 --> 39:11.035
My decision is...

39:14.473 --> 39:15.773
Jennifer.

39:17.142 --> 39:18.442
Take off your jacket.

39:22.380 --> 39:25.148
This has been
your worst service.

39:25.216 --> 39:26.583
Yes?
Yes, chef.

39:26.651 --> 39:28.184
And I don't know
what happened tonight.

39:28.252 --> 39:29.853
But you were not
on the game.

39:29.921 --> 39:31.555
Chef, I can do it.
I'm telling you.

39:31.623 --> 39:33.089
And that is why...

39:33.157 --> 39:34.691
Ohh.
I believe in you.

39:34.759 --> 39:36.192
Oh, my God.
<i>Put that jacket on.</i>

39:36.260 --> 39:37.226
Thank you, chef.

39:37.293 --> 39:38.394
<i>Back in line.</i>

39:40.096 --> 39:41.631
You deserve that jacket.

39:41.698 --> 39:42.798
Bringin' it in.
Bringin' it in.

39:42.866 --> 39:44.500
You deserve
that jacket.

39:44.568 --> 39:45.835
- You deserve that.
- You do.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.040
Ladies...

39:51.107 --> 39:53.508
<i>This is very difficult.</i>

39:53.576 --> 39:54.576
<i>Chef, chef, please.</i>

39:54.644 --> 39:55.844
Don't give up on me, chef!

39:55.912 --> 39:57.478
Please don't give up
on me yet.

39:57.547 --> 39:59.814
<i>Please give me</i>
<i>another shot, chef.</i>

39:59.882 --> 40:01.616
You're both
very passionate.

40:01.684 --> 40:03.418
I can do this.
I promise you.

40:03.485 --> 40:04.886
Both of you,
take your jackets off.

40:06.956 --> 40:08.889
Elizabeth,
come here first.

40:08.957 --> 40:10.958
You came here
for all the right reasons.

40:11.026 --> 40:12.392
You're young.

40:12.460 --> 40:15.495
You've got a huge
future in front of you.

40:15.564 --> 40:17.765
But you are not ready
to take

40:17.832 --> 40:18.699
command of a brigade.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.871
Good night.

40:24.939 --> 40:26.005
Keep your head up, girl.

40:26.073 --> 40:27.173
Keep your head up!

40:29.944 --> 40:32.244
When I set foot
in Hell's Kitchen,

40:32.312 --> 40:34.747
I really wanted
to just prove to myself

40:34.815 --> 40:35.949
that I could do this.

40:36.016 --> 40:37.483
I cooked my ass off.

40:37.551 --> 40:39.151
I tried my hardest.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.119
I think I am
as good of a cook

40:41.187 --> 40:43.221
as everybody else in there
with black jackets

40:43.289 --> 40:46.191
but it just wasn't my time
right now.

40:46.258 --> 40:47.759
<i>Elise, step forward.</i>

40:50.029 --> 40:53.431
It's almost like you're
caught in a downward spiral.

40:53.499 --> 40:55.533
<i>But you have had</i>

40:55.602 --> 40:57.868
success in this competition.

40:57.936 --> 41:00.270
<i>I do see</i>
<i>something in you.</i>

41:00.338 --> 41:01.505
Take this.

41:01.573 --> 41:03.340
Get back in line.

41:03.408 --> 41:04.475
- Oh, my...
<i>- Thank you, chef!</i>

41:04.542 --> 41:05.676
Whoo!

41:07.112 --> 41:08.512
Whoo!

41:10.949 --> 41:12.749
<i>All five of you,</i>
<i>congratulations.</i>

41:12.817 --> 41:13.817
Thank you, chef.

41:13.884 --> 41:15.151
You're now one team.

41:15.219 --> 41:16.853
<i>But get ready</i>
<i>for the service</i>

41:16.921 --> 41:18.554
of your lives.

41:18.623 --> 41:19.990
<i>Now...</i>

41:20.057 --> 41:21.691
Get out of here.

41:21.759 --> 41:24.060
I know that I'm final five.

41:24.128 --> 41:25.662
I know that I deserve
to be here.

41:25.730 --> 41:27.230
And all I can say is,

41:27.297 --> 41:29.698
I got a black jacket.

41:29.766 --> 41:32.701
If Elise thinks that she's
gonna come in with attitude,

41:32.769 --> 41:34.402
she's gonna get  slammed
down to the ground

41:34.470 --> 41:35.804
right quick.

41:35.872 --> 41:37.706
It's just the same.

41:37.774 --> 41:39.241
Now they get to deal
with Elise.

41:39.308 --> 41:40.509
Good luck, guys.

41:40.576 --> 41:43.879
They're in for
a huge surprise.

41:43.947 --> 41:46.981
Tonight was all about charity
in Hell's Kitchen.

41:47.049 --> 41:49.350
And after watching
Elizabeth's performance,

41:49.417 --> 41:52.653
I'm now ready to donate her
jacket to a worthy cause.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.523
Sync by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

41:57.925 --> 41:59.926
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:59.994 --> 42:02.062
It's down to the final five.

42:02.130 --> 42:03.230
Black coats!

42:03.298 --> 42:05.065
Final five!

42:05.133 --> 42:07.134
But the
celebration is short-lived...

42:07.202 --> 42:10.170
Tomorrow night,
there will be another team

42:10.237 --> 42:12.238
inside the red kitchen.

42:12.306 --> 42:14.774
When chef
Ramsay shocks the chefs...

42:14.841 --> 42:16.075
Welcome back.

42:16.143 --> 42:19.379
Ben! Tennille!
Trev! Jillian! Van!

42:19.446 --> 42:21.080
Yeah, baby!

42:21.148 --> 42:22.882
By testing them

42:22.949 --> 42:24.683
against five of
<i>Hell's Kitchen's</i> greatest.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.451
Game time! Whoo!

42:26.519 --> 42:28.654
But when Elise
tries to take over...

42:28.721 --> 42:30.322
I'm not  cooking
will's menu!

42:30.390 --> 42:31.323
Elise...

42:32.425 --> 42:33.692
You're not my mother.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.893
I'm gonna say
what I need to say.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.895
It's not all
what you want.

42:36.962 --> 42:39.164
Will it tear the
newly-formed black team apart?

42:39.232 --> 42:41.165
No! I'm sick of this!

42:41.233 --> 42:43.467
You had to have been
the problem on the Red Team.

42:43.535 --> 42:44.902
I'm not the problem, 'cause
I'm still here. I'm done.

42:44.969 --> 42:46.170
I'm gonna go home right now!
Will...

42:46.238 --> 42:47.705
Find out on a no-holds barred...

42:50.242 --> 42:51.742
Episode of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>
