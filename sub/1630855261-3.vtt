00:14.048 --> 00:16.250
[Rylin] So yesterday,
we watched Tyler set up

00:16.350 --> 00:18.286
a little date for him and Lexi.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.653
And since we are pretty limited

00:19.753 --> 00:21.455
on how much time
we get to spend with her

00:21.555 --> 00:24.425
and getting to know her,
me and Jayme and Sienna

00:24.525 --> 00:26.727
decided to do a girls' hangout.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.729
I'm excited to set this
breakfast up for Lexi

00:28.829 --> 00:30.531
because I think
she's really gonna like it

00:30.631 --> 00:33.967
and hopefully appreciate
spending time with us.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.605
-Good morning.
-Hello.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.340
So we know you had
a stressful night,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.375
and we don't
want to bombard you with a date,

00:41.475 --> 00:42.910
but we want to have
a little girl morning.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.079
-Oh, you guys are so cute.
-So you're gonna come with us

00:45.179 --> 00:48.116
on a little girl vibes,
girl morning.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.818
-Hangout.
-Get out. I'm so excited.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.422
Wait, what do you guys have
in store for me?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.657
[Jayme] Our goal is to make her
feel included also,

00:56.757 --> 00:58.759
because she doesn't really get
to spend a lot of time with us,

00:58.859 --> 01:02.296
and... I think it's nice having,
like, girls in my room to, like,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.831
be able to talk to all the
time.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.134
[funky rock music]

01:06.234 --> 01:08.068
[Lexi] We're going
on the balcony.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.237
Ta-da!

01:09.337 --> 01:11.439
Oh, my gosh.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.640
What the [bleep]?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.175
A lot of things from around...

01:14.275 --> 01:15.376
No, you're joking.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.744
They were all around
the house.

01:16.844 --> 01:17.978
Oh, my God.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.281
-They were like, "Yo."
-I'm, like, freaking out.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.082
You guys just, like, did this
all yourselves?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.283
Yeah.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.485
This is so cute. I can't--

01:24.585 --> 01:26.254
I cannot ask for more,
like this view.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.923
I am really interested
in Sienna and Jayme.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.960
They are two of my top
contenders right now.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.663
I think they're both really,
really pretty.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.465
And I think Rylin is beautiful.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.866
Like, I want to get
to know her.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.268
I was, like, excited.
I'm like, she's so pretty.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.502
I don't know what I was doing.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.036
I was trying to do,
like, stupid art.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.604
Oh, yeah, she made
a heart for you.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.874
-Oh! [laughing]
-Literally used a straw.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.609
I was try-- I was trying
everything.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.744
-She carved an L into one
thing. -I know. I carved an L

01:50.844 --> 01:52.380
and then I was like,
I got to take the L.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.447
That was not good.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.015
-[claps]
-Yeah, no, it's good.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.783
So when did you come out?
Like, has that been like...

01:56.884 --> 01:58.819
I came out, like,
literally years ago.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.020
Okay.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.389
Like, maybe like
six years ago.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.791
I think this is technically
my coming out, so.

02:03.891 --> 02:04.825
Are you serious?

02:04.925 --> 02:07.328
Yeah.
I've never told anyone before.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.795
Wow. I'm proud of you.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.464
We are all just trying
to get to know each other

02:10.564 --> 02:14.101
and kind of have more
of an in-depth conversation

02:14.202 --> 02:16.637
than we've been able to have
when everyone's around.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.307
Luis did get sent home
last night.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.575
Really makes you realize
that you could be next.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.211
You want to know the only
confirmation I needed

02:23.311 --> 02:25.813
to send him home is when he
came to my door last night

02:25.913 --> 02:28.549
to try and apologize to me
about...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.650
Because he made me
cry last night

02:29.750 --> 02:30.718
because I was really upset

02:30.818 --> 02:32.253
how he was talking to Tyler.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.655
And Luis comes
and knocks on my door

02:34.755 --> 02:36.457
and he starts throwing you
under the bus.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.792
He's like, "Oh yeah, like
Rylin's like, so fake."

02:38.892 --> 02:40.694
Like, "She...
she was flirting with me too."

02:40.793 --> 02:42.863
Like, "She's...
she's a pathological liar."

02:42.963 --> 02:44.898
So I was like, "I don't want to
hear any of this."

02:44.998 --> 02:48.902
And I hate it too, because it's
like, I can't defend my name...

02:49.002 --> 02:51.339
-I can try to, but it's like--
-When you're not there.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.542
Yeah, one, I'm not there. Two,
like, y'all don't know me yet.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.378
I would hate to lose
an opportunity

02:57.478 --> 02:59.647
to get to know her more

02:59.747 --> 03:02.350
and get voted off just
because I didn't get a chance

03:02.450 --> 03:03.984
to show her who I am.

03:06.086 --> 03:10.824
[upbeat hip-hop music]

03:19.933 --> 03:22.770
It's day three and the people
on our team need all the help

03:22.870 --> 03:24.171
-they can get.
-Oh, yeah.

[Spicy]
I'm down to five people

03:25.673 --> 03:26.740
[Anthony]
And I have six.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.376
You don't think to just be
like,

03:28.476 --> 03:29.777
"Hey, can I have, like,
a moment?"

03:29.877 --> 03:31.779
-Hi, guys.
-[indistinct]

03:31.879 --> 03:33.680
I want to pull Brian
to the side.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.449
We've got to have
a heart-to-heart talk.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.851
Come on, let's get--
Let's reconnect.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.920
-Enjoy.
-Peace.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.057
All right, let's pop a squat.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.360
Okay, Brian.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.663
So I feel like I haven't had a
chance to vibe with you yet

03:49.763 --> 03:50.898
and kind of find out, like,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.000
where your true
inner strengths are

03:53.100 --> 03:55.803
so that I know, like,
what I need to push harder.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.572
So just give me some things
that, you know, like, "Spicy,

03:58.672 --> 03:59.873
I'm killing it at this,
this and this."

03:59.973 --> 04:03.544
Okay. I feel like
I'm killing it at...

04:03.644 --> 04:06.013
Lexi loves, like,
that goofy personality.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.749
And I'm just goofing
all the time.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.685
I'm doing a little dance
here and there.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.556
I have the jokes, like...
and that can be dangerous,

04:15.656 --> 04:18.459
I feel like, in terms
of getting friend-zoned.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.260
I feel like I'm being
friend-zoned

04:20.361 --> 04:23.697
because a lot of relationships
I've had with girls in the past

04:23.797 --> 04:27.735
start out as friends and then
we just stay as friends.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.403
I don't want her to think like,

04:29.503 --> 04:31.271
"Oh, Brian's not
interested in me."

04:31.372 --> 04:33.273
"He's like a GBF."

and security so we can show her

04:36.909 --> 04:39.547
that there's this like,
playful side to you.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.849
But there's also
this strong side.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
There's also this side
that she can, like,

go into depths with.

be drawing a prompt.

the best time with too.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.031
[laughs]

08:51.131 --> 08:53.066
* Watch me now,
watch me go *

08:53.165 --> 08:56.069
* Here it comes,
I do my thing *

08:56.169 --> 08:57.170
[laughing]

08:58.606 --> 09:02.610
* I do my thing
and I'm about to show you how *

09:02.710 --> 09:04.311
That was fun!

09:04.411 --> 09:05.412
That was fun.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.015
I want all these pictures.
for sure.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.683
You think you know
which one you like?

09:09.783 --> 09:11.118
All of them.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.986
All righty. Thank you.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.756
-Those are really cute.
-So cute.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.225
-[camera shutter]
-[screaming] Oh, my God.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.327
-Wait.
-It looks like we did!

09:20.427 --> 09:22.162
Okay, so I'm going to take
the W on this.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.296
I love you guys.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.066
Lexi. Lexi.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.735
Where art thou, Lexi?

09:27.835 --> 09:30.604
I have an outfit for you,
my fine lady.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.739
Can I come up there?

09:31.839 --> 09:32.873
You can come up here.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.341
Oh, my God. I'm so excited.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.445
-This is so cute.
-Would you mind?

09:38.545 --> 09:39.913
Give me a hug.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.816
This is so cute.
I'll put it on right now.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.785
[Brian]
I have all these flowers.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.253
I have pillows.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.520
I need a ring.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.922
And Spicy says,

09:49.022 --> 09:52.459
"Oh, use my ring.
It's $30,000."

09:52.559 --> 09:53.761
And I go, "Thank you!"

09:53.861 --> 09:55.562
-Lexi.
-This is so cute.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.698
I know we just met two days
ago.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.032
Maybe three.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.869
I've lost track of time,
but would you marry me?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.937
[laughs]
Yes, I will.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.438
Wait. Is this the right hand?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.709
[laughing]

10:08.809 --> 10:10.477
Lexi, would you marry me?
I'm shaking.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.712
You're like shaking.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.613
This is so cute.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.983
[camera shutter]

10:17.985 --> 10:19.252
[screams]

10:19.352 --> 10:20.320
[laughs]

10:21.288 --> 10:22.255
[screams]

10:22.355 --> 10:23.423
This is so cute!

10:23.523 --> 10:25.693
-You look good!
-Thank you, so do you!

10:25.793 --> 10:27.728
-Holy cow!
-I'm gonna take a little...

10:27.828 --> 10:29.196
-Have a seat.
-[laughs]

10:29.296 --> 10:33.165
You came up with
the best idea. Oh my God!

10:33.734 --> 10:34.902
[camera shutter snaps]

10:35.903 --> 10:37.004
[laughs]

10:37.104 --> 10:40.607
[hip-hop music]

10:40.708 --> 10:42.075
[laughing]

10:42.175 --> 10:43.944
Can I grab it, is that like...

10:45.378 --> 10:46.346
[laughs]

10:47.447 --> 10:49.415
Ooh! Get in it!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.484
-Ooh!
-Are those cute?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.889
I'm enjoying this photo shoot
a lot with Lexi,

10:55.989 --> 10:57.124
even though it was very quick.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.792
[indistinct] has
my back on this one.

10:58.892 --> 10:59.960
I'm not gonna lie.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.394
Kalysta has the idea
to do like

11:01.494 --> 11:03.931
a kiss on me
with red lipsticks.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.365
Oh, my God, Lexi,
you look good, though.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.599
Thank you, ah!

11:06.700 --> 11:08.468
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It was gonna fall.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.204
-[mumbling]
-We got this. Oh, my God.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.439
I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna fall.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.807
[gasps]
This is the one!

11:13.907 --> 11:15.809
Oh, my God.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.011
[laughs]

11:18.111 --> 11:19.446
[camera shutter snaps]

11:20.781 --> 11:21.681
[camera shutter snaps]

11:23.316 --> 11:25.853
-Give me a hug!
-You look so sexy.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.487
Thank you.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.257
[Spicy]
Come on over, guys.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.159
[Anthony]
Come on over, everybody.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.162
[Spicy]
Let's get this party started.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.998
All right. How fun was that?

11:38.098 --> 11:39.532
-That photo shoot.
-[overlapping chatter]

11:39.632 --> 11:40.934
[Anthony]
Damn.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.703
Out of nowhere, you guys
just got creative as hell

11:43.804 --> 11:45.105
in, like, two minutes.

11:45.538 --> 11:50.811
So I want to preface this by
saying you guys all did, like,

11:50.911 --> 11:52.245
such an amazing job.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.446
I was thoroughly impressed

11:53.546 --> 11:56.149
by all of your ideas
and concepts

11:56.249 --> 11:57.217
that you came up with.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.618
But at the end of the day, I do

11:58.718 --> 11:59.686
have to pick someone to go

11:59.787 --> 12:01.154
on a date with me.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.124
But I do want to say,
first of all,

12:04.224 --> 12:08.929
the top three that I am choosing
all came from one team.

12:09.830 --> 12:14.835
So in this situation,
we do have a winning team

12:14.935 --> 12:17.270
and I think that winning team
is...

12:22.776 --> 12:27.714
So in this situation, we do
have a winning team

12:27.815 --> 12:31.018
and I think that winning team
is Anthony.

12:31.118 --> 12:35.122
-[cheering and clapping]
-Yeah! Yeah.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.623
Yeah!

12:36.723 --> 12:39.092
So in this challenge I was
focused on getting my team

12:39.192 --> 12:44.164
to show their unique personality
in each and every photo shoot.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.565
Dust shoulders off,
dust shoulders off.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.667
-I see you. I see you.
-Comeback king.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.236
-I told you.
-Yeah, I see. I see.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.005
So I do have to pick a winner.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.208
And the winner will be going on
a special date with me.

12:55.308 --> 12:59.779
Um, and I really had a good
time with this person.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.682
I felt like I connected
with them

13:02.782 --> 13:04.417
on a very intimate level,

13:04.517 --> 13:06.453
more so than just
the pictures we took.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.190
And for those reasons, I'm going
to take Sienna on the date.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.992
[cheering, clapping]

13:12.092 --> 13:13.026
Sienna!

13:13.126 --> 13:15.662
-Congratulations!
-[Sienna] Yes.

13:15.762 --> 13:19.732
Not only did I win, I won being
the first person to go.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.601
I had like the least
amount of time than anyone.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.704
The, like, chemistry
that we had going into

13:24.804 --> 13:26.273
the challenge today

13:26.373 --> 13:29.776
with the photos on the rooftop,
it was very, very romantic.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.211
It felt very intimate.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.215
I have no idea.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.149
Oh, my God.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.250
-Hi.
-Wait. What--

13:37.350 --> 13:38.818
What's happening? Wait.
Are we doing yoga?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.687
[Lexi] We immediately see
two yoga mats.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.089
But there's more.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.824
As we're walking towards
the yoga mats, I hear a--

13:44.925 --> 13:46.259
-[yipping]
-Look at the dogs!

13:46.359 --> 13:47.394
-No way!
-No way!

13:47.494 --> 13:48.728
[Sienna]
Like, this is literally

13:48.828 --> 13:49.997
one of the best moments
of my life.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.032
Like being here.
I'm holding her hand.

13:52.132 --> 13:55.768
I see these two puppies, just
like the cutest things ever.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.005
-Oh, my God.
- [Lexi] We're about to do yoga

13:58.105 --> 14:00.640
with a yoga instructor while
puppies run all over us.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.709
And I'm so excited
because I love dogs.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.776
Have you done puppy yoga?

14:03.877 --> 14:04.945
-[both] No.
-No puppy yoga?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.346
-No.
-All right, let's give it a try.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.981
We're gonna give it a try.
No, I'm freaking out.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.083
Look at all the dogs running
around everywhere.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.385
Okay, so come on to your back,
and you each get

14:12.485 --> 14:15.222
one of these little pups
we're gonna work with today.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.756
All right. Come lying down

14:17.124 --> 14:18.658
and then bring
soles of the feet together.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.592
Knees apart.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.593
Okay.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.963
This is the best day of my
life.

14:23.063 --> 14:23.796
Yeah.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.866
All right. Go ahead and hold
the puppy up above your head.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.201
Look, it's kissing me.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.402
It's kissing me.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.038
[laughs]

14:31.138 --> 14:33.306
And place the puppy
on your legs.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.507
[laughs]

14:34.607 --> 14:35.608
Sienna, are you freaking
out right now?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.543
Who came up with this?

14:36.643 --> 14:37.544
This is the best--

14:37.644 --> 14:39.079
I'm absolutely freaking out.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.950
[pop rock music]

14:43.050 --> 14:44.651
I'm feeling really
good right now.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.719
I think we're vibing off
of each other really well.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.355
Like, super playful
with each other.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.858
The puppies were just adding
to the ambiance of, like,

14:51.959 --> 14:54.394
being excited to finally
have a moment together.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.297
[pop rock music]

14:58.565 --> 14:59.466
[instructor]
Knees.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.469
This is crazy.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.271
Hi, baby.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.738
Lift the puppy in the air.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.276
-Yes. Present that little
puppy. - Lion King .

15:09.376 --> 15:12.045
[indistinct chatter]

15:13.480 --> 15:14.714
Pee break.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.984
[Lexi] Yes. Thank you
for not doing it on me.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.452
I'm sure you ladies know
we always end our classes

15:19.552 --> 15:21.188
-with a Namaste.
-Namaste.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.555
-You want a namaste, puppy?
-So go ahead, yeah.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.557
Place your hands in prayer.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.093
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.427
Inhale.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.162
Exhale.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.365
With gratitude for the puppies
and the practice.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.300
Namaste.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.467
Namaste.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.036
-Yay! Thank you so much.
-Thank you!

15:36.136 --> 15:37.670
I'm going to let you hang out
with the pups for a bit.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.605
-Okay?
-Okay.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.373
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.874
Oh, you're so cute.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.977
So the challenge today
was really fun.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.847
I liked that we had a moment
up on the rooftop.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.050
Oh, I got a puppy escaping me.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.753
But I wanted to know how you
felt about everything.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.322
There's-- there's a lot.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.358
Like, coming in with Jayme
was definitely not something...

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
I want to know more about that.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.794
Yeah, and I think that's
absolutely valid.

16:01.894 --> 16:05.198
Okay, so we were seeing
each other for a while.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.066
Like...

16:06.166 --> 16:07.834
Like almost like eight months.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.769
-Oh, that's a long time.
-And, yeah.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.404
It was a long time.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.473
[Lexi] Finally, someone is
honest with me about something.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.209
Sienna opens up to me and tells
me that her and Jayme

16:16.309 --> 16:18.478
did, in fact, used to be
romantically involved.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.248
I really hate that I've had to
wait this long to find out,

16:21.348 --> 16:23.283
but I am glad that
I know the truth now.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.885
I don't know. I think she
never really wanted

16:25.985 --> 16:27.787
to be in a relationship,

16:27.887 --> 16:30.890
and it was almost like
we transitioned

16:30.990 --> 16:32.625
into being more like friends.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.595
Like there's not a lot of
gay girls in Santa Barbara,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.097
so it was like we had that
in common.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.598
So I knew something was up
the second

16:38.698 --> 16:41.334
we had the three-minute date
and I mentioned like that,

16:41.434 --> 16:43.036
you guys, I thought you guys
went to school together

16:43.136 --> 16:44.537
because I thought
that that's what she said.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.074
Sienna and I go to
Santa Barbara, school together.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.076
-I don't know anyone's name.
-Sienna's the blonde one.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.010
-Okay.
-We're both in Santa Barbara.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.680
But I've also, like had people
tell me in the house

16:53.780 --> 16:56.816
just that you guys, there's
something that's still there.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.885
So I want to hear from you.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.853
-Like what you think about
that. -Yeah.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.290
You don't want to have a
conversation on a first date

17:03.390 --> 17:06.992
about your ex,
but I felt very open

17:07.094 --> 17:09.195
to talk about all
of the questions she had.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.931
I don't... I don't know that
there's anything still there.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.334
I think we're very different
people from the core.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.069
I'm just-- I was just curious
because, like,

17:16.169 --> 17:18.905
I never got the chance to,
like,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.608
talk on you on... like,
talk with you one-on-one.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.943
And I like you.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.545
I want to get to know you
a lot more.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.881
And that's why I wanted to go
on the date with you.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.551
[Sienna] I really want
to kiss her right now,

17:31.651 --> 17:35.288
but I also am trying to just
wait for that perfect moment.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.225
Like give it that perfect
lead-up that it needs.

17:38.325 --> 17:42.495
But I felt like we really
had that chemistry there.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.164
Very intimate with you,
even though I get like

17:44.264 --> 17:46.533
a few seconds,
like at a time, alone.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.168
I really like it.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.105
-Dude, this dog is so cute.
-I know.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.707
Are you cold?
Oh, my God.

17:54.807 --> 17:55.775
-What?
-Lexi.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.944
[gasps]
The nails are painted.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.246
Oh, my gosh.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.747
You're a queen.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.681
[clacking]

18:01.781 --> 18:03.483
[hip-hop music]

18:03.583 --> 18:05.318
All right, let's see
what you got, buddy.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.286
Hey, what--

18:06.386 --> 18:07.820
What do you want,
stripes or... ?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.423
I'm going to take solids
because there's less.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.460
Okay.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.527
I'm making my shots

18:14.627 --> 18:16.296
on and off the court.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.799
Okay, so that reminds me,
what we talked about.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.100
Do you remember what we said?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.435
Yes, I do remember
what you said.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.870
Okay. What did I tell you?

18:23.970 --> 18:27.774
You told me pretty much that the
little things mattered the most,

18:27.874 --> 18:29.542
pretty much, and it was like

18:29.642 --> 18:32.745
me taking in all the little
things that she has going on

18:32.845 --> 18:35.448
and, like, pointing them out and
making her feel special about.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.716
-Yes.
-Every-- Like--

18:36.816 --> 18:38.785
Every time she, like,
is, like, needing something,

18:38.885 --> 18:41.188
like, I'm always there. Like,
you know, she can count on me.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.490
-Good. Good. I like that.
-I feel like. So...

18:45.358 --> 18:46.393
Ah!

18:47.760 --> 18:49.996
Little thoughtful things
that you could do for Lexi

18:50.096 --> 18:52.499
even if there's...
Did you just get a s--

18:52.599 --> 18:55.368
I just got that in and that's
not in. So I'm going again.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.004
Holy shit.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.607
I promise I'm not usually
this good, y'all. [laughs]

19:00.707 --> 19:03.276
Me and Lexi have pretty good
moments at the house,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.278
but I feel like everyone's
stepping up their game

19:05.378 --> 19:06.145
at this point.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.581
And so, like, I got to be like,

19:08.681 --> 19:10.250
okay, I got to step up my game.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.618
I don't know.
I got to figure it out.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.187
I'm just an easy-flowing guy,
you know?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.489
-Just go with the flow.
-I can tell, dude. I can tell.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.090
-I just go with the flow.
-That's the French way.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.159
-Yeah, exactly.
-[laughs]

19:20.260 --> 19:22.629
* Is this pain, is it love,
is it hurt? *

19:23.630 --> 19:26.032
** I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know *

19:26.132 --> 19:27.734
[Lexi]
Okay, guys. So...

19:27.834 --> 19:31.037
I have really been wanting
to get to know you all better.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.774
And I know I'm here to, like,
find my match.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.743
And in order to do that,

19:36.843 --> 19:38.845
I do have to know
more about you.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.680
So I thought,
what better way to do that

19:40.780 --> 19:43.115
than to play a fun little game?

19:43.216 --> 19:45.252
It's only day three
and I feel like I--

19:45.352 --> 19:46.753
I want to crack open the egg.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.255
I want to get to know
everybody.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.357
I want all the secrets
to spill out.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.759
And so I think it would be
a fun way to do that

19:52.859 --> 19:54.227
if we played a little game.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.762
So how this is going to work

19:55.862 --> 19:58.130
is I'm going to start off
and ask myself the question

19:58.231 --> 19:59.932
and I'll pass it along
to someone

20:00.032 --> 20:01.368
and then you'll
answer the question.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.902
And that's kind of how
the game is going to work.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.036
[overlapping chatter]

20:04.136 --> 20:05.071
-Let's go.
-[Lexi] Let's do this.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.673
What is one improvement you are

20:06.773 --> 20:08.074
trying to make in your life?

20:08.174 --> 20:10.042
I'll go first. I would say
one improvement

20:10.142 --> 20:11.944
I'm trying to make
in my life right now is

20:12.044 --> 20:13.680
my sleeping schedule
is really, really bad.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.214
I was up at like 4:00
in the morning last night.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.649
I need to, like, not do that

20:16.749 --> 20:18.751
'cause it just drains my energy
throughout the day.

20:18.851 --> 20:22.188
So I will pass
this question to...

20:22.922 --> 20:24.190
I'll pass it to Cyprien.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.427
One improvement that I'm trying
to make in my life

20:27.527 --> 20:30.229
is not letting other people
get into my head

20:30.330 --> 20:32.365
and not letting other people
make decisions for me,

20:32.465 --> 20:35.902
especially coming into a new
American high school.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.137
I felt as though I had
to conform

20:38.237 --> 20:41.274
and kind of follow what
everyone else was doing.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.143
It was just a way for me
to fit in pretty much.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.814
And actually, one example
was freshman year

20:47.914 --> 20:50.483
in my like new, brand-new friend
group that I had just met,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.885
we were all in a car and they
were passing around a vape.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.888
They like passed it to me
and I was like, "Oh, I'm good."

20:55.988 --> 20:57.223
They were like,
"If you don't hit this,

20:57.324 --> 20:58.558
we're kicking you out the car,

20:58.658 --> 21:00.059
we're not gonna be
friends with you anymore."

21:00.159 --> 21:02.395
So prime example
of peer pressure.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.131
I'm really opening up
about my past life

21:05.231 --> 21:06.766
and how I was an ex-vaper.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.235
I really wanted to get through
to everyone because

21:09.336 --> 21:12.004
it was really important for me
to tell my story

21:12.104 --> 21:13.806
and have not anyone
feel that way.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.977
So I would definitely say
it did play a kind of big role

21:18.077 --> 21:20.513
in my whole mental health
battles

21:20.613 --> 21:22.214
and issues throughout
high school.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.685
And so, yeah, just love you
and love yourself

21:25.785 --> 21:27.720
and don't let anyone make
any decisions for you, so...

21:27.820 --> 21:30.490
Do you think you started vaping
to, like, make you feel better

21:30.590 --> 21:32.392
and it, like, just started
making you feel worse?

21:32.492 --> 21:33.760
Or, like, how was that for you?

21:33.860 --> 21:36.796
It was kind of like
an instant gratification.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.566
In the moment, I was like,
"Wow, I'm really fitting in."

21:39.666 --> 21:42.735
"Wow. This kind of tastes like
fruity. Like, wow, so cool."

21:42.835 --> 21:45.772
But in the end of the day,
it was so detrimental.

21:45.872 --> 21:49.075
Like the instant gratification
was not worth what it entailed.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.510
Do not recommend.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.011
Yeah, I know what you mean
by that.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.180
I feel as though Lexi
really appreciates

21:54.280 --> 21:55.615
actually me opening up.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.350
I feel like she can maybe
a little bit relate

21:57.450 --> 21:58.618
to what I'm talking about.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.252
Thank you for sharing.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.621
I'll give this one to Josh.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.858
Talk about a time you have
fallen in love

22:05.958 --> 22:07.660
with the wrong person.

22:08.194 --> 22:12.432
It was high school
and there was this guy I knew

22:12.532 --> 22:14.667
who went to a different school
and he had a girlfriend

22:14.767 --> 22:17.269
who went to my school
and they ended up breaking up.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.705
And so, like, I was there
to comfort her

22:18.805 --> 22:20.740
just because we had
the same class together.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.742
And then, I started like

22:22.842 --> 22:24.210
developing feelings for her

22:24.310 --> 22:26.779
and she would help me with like
my social media videos.

22:26.879 --> 22:30.417
And apparently the whole time
we were doing that,

22:30.517 --> 22:32.318
she was talking to my friend.

22:32.419 --> 22:35.688
And so like, I figured it out
and it was--

22:35.788 --> 22:37.490
I was just really hurt
in the moment.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.258
But I still wanted to keep
going back to her

22:39.358 --> 22:41.327
just because we had developed
that connection so much.

22:41.428 --> 22:45.131
And it was just very harmful
to myself and my confidence.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.298
-Yeah, yeah...
-So...

22:46.399 --> 22:48.200
-That's awful.
-Yeah.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.602
I'm not gonna lie.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.870
That didn't happen.
I made that up.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.204
I had to make it up on the spot

22:52.304 --> 22:54.273
as a way to show my
more emotional side,

22:54.373 --> 22:55.307
my more down-to-earth,

22:55.408 --> 22:57.276
"Aw, broken boy," sad.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.546
Come on now.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.680
I faded that.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.181
[Lexi]
Next question.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.216
This is actually, like,
really juicy.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.052
We're getting--
we're getting into it.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.654
I'm gonna give
this question to Jasmine.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.891
Just remember, you have
to read it out.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.495
Um, what's a house secret
you've been holding onto

23:15.595 --> 23:17.664
that most people don't know?

23:17.764 --> 23:18.898
I'll go first.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.701
Brian screams in his sleep.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.002
[laughter]

23:23.102 --> 23:26.072
Why? Why'd you
expose me like that?

23:26.172 --> 23:27.874
-It's like, "Why?"
-Go tell 'em. Tell 'em.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.341
Well, I was sleeping.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.277
I can't. I can't--

23:31.377 --> 23:33.312
"Purple. Purple."

23:37.717 --> 23:40.453
-[overlapping chatter]
-"Purple! Green!"

23:40.553 --> 23:42.555
He looks at me.
And I'm like, "What?"

23:42.655 --> 23:44.991
I wake up
and your eyes are wide open.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.626
Here you go, bestie.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.594
-Oh.
-Oh.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.597
-I knew that was coming.
-[laughs]

23:50.697 --> 23:51.598
Um...

23:52.765 --> 23:57.537
I actually just found out
from a little birdie that Tyler

23:57.637 --> 24:01.073
said that he has been
consistently trying to [bleep]

24:01.173 --> 24:03.075
Jayme and Sienna both.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.913
And that was what I--
First quote, end quote.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.749
I'm just like, my jaw
is dropped on the floor.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.650
And I don't know.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.418
I don't have anything to say.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.854
I'm just like, there's--
is this really like,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.422
did that actually happen?

24:16.523 --> 24:17.690
Is there any proof?

24:17.790 --> 24:18.925
Like, I don't know.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.894
I wouldn't put it past him,
but I-- I trust him.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.398
Tyler did say that.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.968
He did say that.
That's all I'm gonna say.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.870
He did say that.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.371
[laughs]

24:32.471 --> 24:35.407
Just a little secret
that was told to me,

24:35.508 --> 24:37.910
and I was very very interested
to hear about that, so...

24:38.945 --> 24:39.979
I will pass this card back.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.848
I was expecting that to happen.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.016
Know what, we're throwing
shots. Let me throw this.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.251
Last night she whispered

24:45.351 --> 24:46.553
in my boy's ear
that she wanted

24:46.653 --> 24:48.187
to cuddle with Josh last night.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.188
Is that not true?

24:49.288 --> 24:50.156
No, it's true.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.357
-Okay.
-Yeah.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.693
Okay.

24:54.794 --> 24:58.430
I'm baffled, honestly, like this
game has revealed so much to me.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.634
I see the intricate
relationships that have been

25:01.734 --> 25:03.870
formed in a good way
and in a bad way,

25:03.970 --> 25:07.173
and this has helped me a lot
to get a little bit of insight

25:07.273 --> 25:08.608
as to how everything's going.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.643
I'm going to give this to
Jayme.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.079
Jaymesta.

25:13.980 --> 25:14.814
Sizzle.

25:14.914 --> 25:15.948
Oh, God.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.383
-You got it, Jayme.
-You're a real G.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.752
-You got this.
-You got this.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.787
Um...

25:24.356 --> 25:26.292
I'm going to give this to
Jayme.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.928
Jaymesta.

25:29.629 --> 25:30.462
Sizzle.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.633
Oh, God. [laughs]

25:33.733 --> 25:35.434
-Um...
-No, she can't pass.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.269
Okay.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.939
-You got it, Jayme.
-You're a real G.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.874
-You got this.
-You got this.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.109
We'll support you.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
Uh... if you had to go
for someone

25:45.311 --> 25:48.047
in the house that wasn't Lexi,
who would it be?

25:48.147 --> 25:50.449
-Oh, God.
-I'll go first.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.517
Um...

25:53.252 --> 25:56.723
Um, in the past, I have gone
for Sienna before.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.626
Obviously, as a lot
of you guys know.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.793
Currently, I would not go

26:00.893 --> 26:02.461
for anyone else besides Lexi.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.531
-That-- there's my answer.
-Okay.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.001
[Marc]
People are looking around.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.937
I see people moving away,

26:11.037 --> 26:13.673
putting their hands
in their faces.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.107
It's getting pretty intense.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.543
They dropped a bomb,
and then another bomb,

26:17.644 --> 26:18.678
and then another bomb,

26:18.778 --> 26:20.279
and then another bomb.
Explosion.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.114
Shit's crazy.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.851
I'll pass this to Tyler.

26:24.951 --> 26:25.818
Oh.

26:25.918 --> 26:30.156
-[shouting]
-[chatter]

26:30.256 --> 26:31.290
Everyone is a villain right
now.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.626
We're trying to set people up.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.295
All right. [clears throat] Ah.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.029
[laughter]

26:37.129 --> 26:38.931
I'm going with.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.868
[under breath]
Eenie meenie...

26:41.968 --> 26:43.435
[gasps]

26:43.535 --> 26:46.038
No way. No [bleep].

26:46.138 --> 26:48.540
The respect is
through the roof.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.242
I don't know what to say here,
to be honest.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.678
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

26:51.778 --> 26:52.979
Oh.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.848
Tyler's my boy and I love him.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.150
But that made him look so bad.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.418
[Josh]
Terrible.

26:59.518 --> 27:00.787
[Cyprien]
Like he's portraying the girls,

27:00.887 --> 27:03.389
like the two girls, so bad.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.992
Dude, he does not miss one
single time to make himself

27:06.092 --> 27:07.259
-look stupid as [bleep]
-No.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.828
-[overlapping chatter]
-Can I say Brian?

27:08.928 --> 27:10.196
Brian.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.297
Yeah.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.865
[cheering]

27:12.965 --> 27:14.801
That was really bad, Tyler,

27:14.901 --> 27:15.968
I'm not gonna lie.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.236
That was so [bleep] up.

27:17.804 --> 27:21.841
Kalysta. Talk about a time
that you told a massive lie.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.543
I'll go first. Dead.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.212
I be lying sometimes.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.614
-Uh, I'm not even gonna lie.
-[laughter]

27:28.715 --> 27:29.749
I be lying.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.917
This one's stupid.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.952
Like, when I was a kid,
I was, like,

27:33.052 --> 27:35.054
really embarrassed
that I got held back.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.157
And so I told everybody
that I was, like, an age younger

27:38.257 --> 27:40.426
-than I actually was.
-[laughter]

27:40.526 --> 27:44.831
Like, at some point that lie had
to kind of, like, come through.

27:44.931 --> 27:48.400
I was like, "Actually, guys,
yeah, I got [bleep] held back."

27:48.500 --> 27:49.301
"There it is."

27:49.401 --> 27:50.970
"I got held back
and I'm not 12."

27:51.070 --> 27:52.104
"I'm 13."

27:52.204 --> 27:53.405
-[laughter]
-That's a good one.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.673
-[clapping and laughter]
-That's a good one.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.742
"I'm 11, so shut
the [bleep] up."

27:55.842 --> 27:57.810
[laughter]

27:57.910 --> 28:01.848
Um, who's a big,
fat, juicy liar?

28:01.948 --> 28:02.949
Rylin.

28:03.049 --> 28:03.983
Oh.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.119
-[all] Oh!
-No!

28:07.219 --> 28:08.554
-[Kalysta] Sorry!
-Oh no!

28:08.654 --> 28:09.956
-[all] Oh!
-No.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.390
-My--
-Yeah, rumor has it.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.259
Oh, my God.
I was totally kidding.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.794
I like Kalysta.
I love Kalysta.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.063
-She be-- [mimics machine gun]
-Kalysta's that girl.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.265
[Rylin]
I just want to preface.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.167
I don't typically lie.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.102
A big part of, like,
who I think I am

28:23.202 --> 28:25.037
is the fact that I always
tell my truth.

28:25.137 --> 28:30.609
Back in February of this
year...

28:31.443 --> 28:32.378
um...

28:34.680 --> 28:39.185
I had-- I had gotten pregnant
and I told the guy that the test

28:39.285 --> 28:40.887
came out negative,
but it didn't.

28:40.987 --> 28:41.921
It was positive.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.090
And I was like, "No, I'm not."

28:44.190 --> 28:47.026
But I was. Um, I'm not anymore.

28:47.126 --> 28:47.960
It was a miscarriage.

28:48.060 --> 28:48.995
But...

28:49.095 --> 28:50.930
-Aw.
-Thank you for sharing.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.464
Yeah.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.666
No, guys, I already cried
about like eight times today.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.669
So I'm like, I'm not gonna
cry right now.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
to hear that.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.174
It's really difficult because
nobody really understands

29:02.274 --> 29:04.911
at this age that it's like,
it's not a good thing.

29:05.011 --> 29:07.546
Like even though it wasn't
intentional, like that was still

29:07.646 --> 29:11.183
something that was very much so
a part of me.

29:11.283 --> 29:14.086
-So...
-I'm really sorry to hear that.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.421
Shit happens.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.156
Shit goes down.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.758
You're strong.
You're super strong.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.329
[Rylin] Kalysta accuses me
of being a liar.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.763
I don't know what her deal is.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.065
I've never lied to her,

29:26.165 --> 29:29.001
but I honestly was glad
she gave me the card

29:29.101 --> 29:32.138
because it gave me the chance
to open up a little bit more

29:32.238 --> 29:35.241
about some of the experiences
I've been going through.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.776
Thank you for trusting us and
sharing us and opening up...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.178
-Totally.
-...about that.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.247
-That takes a lot of guts.
-A lot of respect.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.849
-[muttering]
-Big respect.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.683
I'm going to give this
to Camille.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.689
Who do you think should be
eliminated tonight and why?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.624
I'll go first. Um...

29:52.724 --> 29:54.626
This is just...
yeah, my honest opinion.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.662
Tyler, you already know.
I think it should be Tyler.

29:56.762 --> 30:00.566
Just for the simple fact that I
feel like throughout the house,

30:00.666 --> 30:03.402
his behaviors doesn't
reflect what is necessarily

30:03.502 --> 30:05.237
maybe being portrayed to you
because you're not

30:05.337 --> 30:07.206
in the house 24/7 with us.

30:07.306 --> 30:10.642
And in my opinion, I don't
think that it's respectful

30:10.742 --> 30:15.047
to all three of you ladies,
not just one person.

30:15.147 --> 30:19.151
Um, and that's just who I think
should be eliminated tonight.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.253
I think Jayme should get
eliminated.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.556
I just don't think you're in it
for the right reasons.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.226
I think your head's
in a different place.

30:28.394 --> 30:31.230
I think you have feelings
for other people.

30:31.830 --> 30:36.168
I don't think you're
a good match for Lexi.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.605
-[scoffs]
-Oh, my God. Okay.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.875
Lawdy, lawdy!

30:42.975 --> 30:47.213
When I find out that there's
all these other secret things

30:47.313 --> 30:50.282
going on behind my back,
it makes me question

30:50.382 --> 30:51.683
the intent of a person.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.485
And it's something that
I'm gonna have to consider

30:53.585 --> 30:55.187
when going into elimination.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.389
-Respectfully, respectfully,
-Totally, 100%.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.191
I appreciate you guys all
for being honest

30:59.291 --> 31:00.893
and getting down
to the nitty-gritty.

31:00.993 --> 31:04.096
I know some of those questions
were really not easy

31:04.196 --> 31:06.032
or questions that
you'd want to answer.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.866
And I know we got emotional.

31:07.967 --> 31:13.039
Um, but I appreciate you all
and I'm really enjoying my time

31:13.139 --> 31:15.474
with each and every single one
of you. I hope you know that.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.677
I mean that. And I hope
you guys are having fun too.

31:18.777 --> 31:19.411
So that was fun.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.646
[clapping and cheering]

31:20.746 --> 31:22.714
I need my therapist
on speed dial.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.350
-So do I.
-Oh.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.286
* One hundred soldiers
are down *

31:27.386 --> 31:29.855
* One hundred soldiers
around me *

31:29.956 --> 31:32.758
* One hundred strong
we want bounty *

31:32.858 --> 31:38.364
I'm not like a fire starter,
but I've got [bleep] question.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.566
It is what it is.
And honestly, sometimes

31:40.666 --> 31:42.534
you need to spill the beans.

31:42.634 --> 31:46.472
So that game got a lot crazier
than I thought it was going to.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.374
And now it feels like everyone
in this house

31:48.474 --> 31:50.609
is just walking around trying
to do damage control.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.911
See, Cammy tried to go
behind her back.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.547
What do you mean
"behind her back"?

31:55.647 --> 31:57.616
She just asked me about it,
like Lexi just asked,

31:57.716 --> 31:59.251
"Did Cammy really
ask Josh that?"

31:59.351 --> 32:00.953
-And I was like, "Yeah."
-Oh.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.621
And I was like, "You can ask
Josh, he'll tell you."

32:02.721 --> 32:04.223
And she was like,
"How'd you know?"

32:04.323 --> 32:05.891
And I was like, Josh told
the boys last night,

32:05.992 --> 32:09.328
and I was like, "Respectfully,
Josh is not going to do it."

32:09.428 --> 32:11.663
Like, he's like, "I'm not
here for you." He told her.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.265
The crazy thing is,
Cammy came to me first.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.401
That's what-- Yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.802
Cammy came to me first
to tell Josh.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.537
That's what I said.
I even brought that up.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.507
And I was like, the boys shut
that shit down, you know?

32:22.074 --> 32:23.809
-[indistinct]
-Gang, baby.

32:23.909 --> 32:27.746
Jasmine tells me that
Cammy likes me.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.315
She's like, "You want me to
put you on, set you up?"

32:29.415 --> 32:30.649
I'm like, "Nah, I'm good."

32:30.749 --> 32:32.218
She asked me that, like,
four different times.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.552
Each time I was like,
"Nah, I'm good."

32:33.652 --> 32:34.987
I have a question for you.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.088
Yeah.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.825
When Cammy said that Tyler said

32:39.925 --> 32:42.061
that he wanted to like...

32:43.129 --> 32:47.433
you and... and, um... Sienna.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.834
Like, have you heard
anything about that?

32:48.934 --> 32:51.237
I mean, he flirts
with both of us back and forth.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.704
Yeah.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.541
He tried to kiss me in my room
the other day,

32:56.375 --> 32:58.710
and I told him that is not
going to happen.

32:59.845 --> 33:03.415
So Jayme told me
that Tyler tried to kiss her

33:03.515 --> 33:06.285
before he took me out
on our special little date.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.788
And honestly, at this point,
I don't know what to feel.

33:09.888 --> 33:13.125
I thought that that was
a really genuine gesture

33:13.225 --> 33:14.393
on Tyler's behalf,

33:14.493 --> 33:16.562
and now I'm questioning
his intentions.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.764
-That just changed so much.
-Really?

33:18.864 --> 33:21.467
Yeah, you just gave me
a lot of insight.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.535
-[laughs]
-He's-- He's a cool guy.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.437
I just had
a conversation with him

33:25.537 --> 33:27.506
where he, like, fed me so much

33:27.606 --> 33:29.441
different stuff
than what you just said.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.943
Who do y'all think's
gettin' eliminated tonight?

33:32.044 --> 33:33.579
-I think it's me or Cammy.
-No, I think--

33:33.679 --> 33:35.747
-What? Are you... ?
-I think it's Jayme or Cammy.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.449
-Do you see what's going on?
-I don't think it's you.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.818
I think it's you or Jayme.

33:39.918 --> 33:40.819
Oh.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.422
[Tyler]
It's not me.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.357
-Oh.
-Don't say that.

33:45.457 --> 33:46.925
-Honestly, though.
-Don't say that.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.061
In the end of the day.
I don't think it's you, though.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.096
Don't say that.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.497
I don't think it's you, but I--

33:51.597 --> 33:53.265
I know it's really scary
to be in that position.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.800
-I think. I think--
-I'm sittin' here like--

33:54.900 --> 33:57.303
This is the line right here.
This is the line right here.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.837
On the other side of the line
is elimination.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.606
I think you're like
right behind.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.874
This is what I might think.
She might scare you type shit.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.476
And then Anthony fittin'
to come save your ass

34:04.576 --> 34:06.345
because Anthony is the GOAT.
Anthony is the GOAT.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.647
-Anthony is the GOAT.
-[overlapping chatter]

34:21.793 --> 34:23.562
[Jayme] Kalysta is like,
I'm here for the wrong reason.

34:23.661 --> 34:24.696
Like, that's absolutely
not the case.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.998
It's my-- the right, like--

34:31.103 --> 34:33.004
I'm just-- I feel stuck.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.741
With what to do.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.944
I'm in a very difficult place

34:39.043 --> 34:40.978
because I feel like
whatever decision I make,

34:41.079 --> 34:42.313
I'm going to end up
hurting someone,

34:42.414 --> 34:43.915
whether it's myself or Sienna.

34:44.014 --> 34:47.585
Like I'd be hurting myself if I
don't allow myself to continue

34:47.686 --> 34:49.355
my experience here and, like,
get to know Lexi

34:49.455 --> 34:50.556
because I'm so worried about

34:50.656 --> 34:52.224
how someone else
is going to feel.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.926
And I don't want to be
in a place

34:55.025 --> 34:56.862
where it's Sienna and I
against each other.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.030
She's like, "I saw you." Even
if when I make eye contact

34:59.131 --> 35:01.800
with her, like, "I see you
making eye contact with her."

35:01.900 --> 35:04.303
I'm like, yeah, because I'm
trying to connect with her.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.971
But then she's aware of
everything I do,

35:06.071 --> 35:08.774
and it's really hard when I'm
hurting someone's feelings

35:08.874 --> 35:11.643
just by making eye contact
with someone else, you know?

35:12.344 --> 35:13.445
[blows raspberry]

35:19.185 --> 35:20.319
-Mm-mm.
-Okay.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.555
[sobs] I can't-- I can't do it.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.028
[Jayme] It just sucks that we're
both here. That's really it.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.897
There's nothing.
There's nothing else to do

35:31.997 --> 35:33.599
besides, like, acknowledge
the fact

35:33.699 --> 35:36.134
that it sucks
and it's hard to figure out.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.538
I'm, like, looking
at all you guys

35:39.638 --> 35:41.373
and, like, learning
your stories.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.476
And I'm like,
"None of y'all are ready."

35:45.010 --> 35:47.713
None of you guys
are ready for this. Like...

35:48.847 --> 35:51.082
Like you have your own shit
to deal with.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.318
Everyone. All of you

35:52.418 --> 35:54.152
have your own shit to deal
with.

35:54.253 --> 35:57.223
I... Personally, I feel like
I have time for a girlfriend.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.360
I have time for a lover,
to travel to her to see her,

36:01.460 --> 36:06.398
to be with her, to literally do
anything for her, beckon to her.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.133
And I just feel like none of you
guys have the time for that.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.101
None of you guys are in
the headspace for that.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.638
-I feel like--
-And I said what I said.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.007
I think it's crazy because
like, I finally get out here,

36:16.107 --> 36:18.710
I get to speak my truth,
the truth that everybody

36:18.810 --> 36:20.579
has been waiting to hear

36:20.679 --> 36:23.582
and also the truth
that's just been like up in--

36:23.682 --> 36:25.551
like the elephant in the room.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.319
[Brian]
Like, what are you here for?

36:27.419 --> 36:32.090
Like, like, homegirl, just be
honest, because I'm out here,

36:32.190 --> 36:34.025
like, trying to make it
towards the end.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.962
And I don't need this like,
gray-- this gray area

36:37.062 --> 36:39.998
of these people that need to
get their shit together.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.066
And I-- I hear you.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.302
I feel like I actually feel
as though

36:43.402 --> 36:47.005
I would be more put together
if I was with somebody

36:47.105 --> 36:49.341
-because right now, I'm a--
-So you're like relying on

36:49.441 --> 36:50.942
someone else to put you
back together.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.945
It's giving co...
It's giving codependent.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.047
I-- I-- I-- I'm shocked.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.850
I don't-- I don't understand.
Like, you don't know me.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.619
Like, you know nothing about me

37:00.719 --> 37:03.088
and I'm just... I'm over it.

37:03.188 --> 37:14.800
I hope she goes home.
I don't want her here anymore.

37:20.639 --> 37:24.876
Hi, daters. Welcome to
the third elimination ceremony.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.579
Just like last time,
Lexi is gonna be going through

37:27.679 --> 37:28.747
your dating profiles...

37:28.847 --> 37:30.215
...as your coaches

37:30.316 --> 37:33.519
will make a last-ditch attempt

37:34.052 --> 37:36.187
as to why we think
you should stay.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.991
But ultimately,
it's Lexi's decision

37:40.091 --> 37:42.361
whether you're going home

37:42.461 --> 37:44.963
or whether you get
a second chance at love.

37:45.063 --> 37:45.997
Good luck.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.234
Okay, guys. So today was a lot.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.269
There was a lot of fun things
that happened,

37:51.370 --> 37:53.171
but there was also
a lot of drama.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.273
The first person I want to talk
to is Camille.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.443
So, Camille, could you
step forward, please?

37:59.478 --> 38:02.748
I have had such a good time
getting to know you.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.050
Not only today, the day before.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.486
I think we have
a really genuine connection.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.087
And I think you're
a really sweet girl.

38:09.187 --> 38:14.526
I did find out some stuff that
happened in the house last night

38:14.626 --> 38:18.430
when I wasn't there that did
kind of raise a red flag

38:18.530 --> 38:22.801
and was cause for a little bit
of concern for me.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.903
And I think you know
what I'm talking about.

38:25.003 --> 38:25.971
Okay.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.105
Because of that,

38:27.205 --> 38:28.874
you are up
for elimination tonight

38:28.974 --> 38:30.308
-and I'm sorry.
-Okay.

38:30.409 --> 38:33.345
I feel like Tyler kind of
is blowing up my spot.

38:33.445 --> 38:36.482
I haven't had time to talk
to Josh yet,

38:36.582 --> 38:38.550
especially since last night,

38:38.650 --> 38:40.586
and I'm definitely
not happy with him.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.589
The next person I want
to talk to is Josh.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.624
Josh, can you step forward
for me, please?

38:45.724 --> 38:51.497
[tense music]

38:51.597 --> 38:52.931
I'm just messing with you.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.066
Josh, you are awesome.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.067
[scoffs]

38:56.167 --> 38:58.670
-[Lexi] I...
-[all] Aw.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.541
I-- I have loved
to get to know you recently.

39:02.641 --> 39:06.244
You're a really sweet boy,
but I want you to put

39:06.344 --> 39:08.447
a little more romance
into some of your actions.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.249
I want you to show me
what you're made of,

39:11.349 --> 39:12.584
uh, 'cause I know it's there.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.587
And so because of that,
you will remain a match.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.756
-So you can step back.
-Okay.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.190
[laughter]

39:19.290 --> 39:21.359
-Dun-dun-dun.
-I wanted to mess with you.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.763
The next person I want
to talk about is Cyprien. Um...

39:24.863 --> 39:27.365
Cyp, you are a gem.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.635
You are a really sweet boy.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.003
I had a lot of fun talking
with you today

39:32.103 --> 39:34.540
and I'm really excited
to keep getting to know you.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.476
Our picture-taking was really
fun, I thought it was funny.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.944
It looked like we were like
literally kissing.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.781
We weren't. We weren't kissing,
but it looked like it.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.917
Um, for those reasons,
you will remain a match.

39:46.017 --> 39:49.287
[clapping]

39:49.387 --> 39:51.490
The next person I want to talk
about is Brian.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.592
Brian, if you could
step forward, please.

39:55.961 --> 39:59.765
Brian, you are like one
of the biggest sweethearts here.

39:59.865 --> 40:03.702
I seriously loved
the conversation we had

40:03.802 --> 40:06.304
when we were doing pottery
on the group date.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.339
You are such a kind soul.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.008
I can tell, like,
through and through.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.644
You are one of the kindest souls
here. Genuinely I mean that.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.714
I do think that there's a little
something missing, though.

40:15.814 --> 40:19.084
I don't think we've made, like,
the biggest connection.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.419
And I really, really,
really want to.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.121
For those reasons,
you are going to be up

40:23.221 --> 40:24.623
for elimination tonight.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.825
[Brian] I really thought
I woke up this morning like

40:26.925 --> 40:28.126
doing my thing.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.495
I was feeling confident,

40:29.595 --> 40:34.500
but I feel like I'm in this
friend zone world.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.267
Why am I doing that to myself?

40:36.367 --> 40:38.103
Like, why am I doing that
to myself?

40:38.203 --> 40:40.806
Don't know if it's like a guard
I'm putting up for myself.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.174
It's two people that I love
the most inside the house,

40:43.274 --> 40:46.778
and I can't imagine the house
being the same without them.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.548
The last person
I want to talk to is Tyler.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.983
Tyler, could you step forward
for me?

40:52.083 --> 40:52.984
Of course.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.154
[Tyler] So Lexi calls my name

40:56.254 --> 40:57.889
after there's
two people on the block,

40:57.989 --> 40:59.825
and I'm like, "Wow."

41:00.959 --> 41:02.794
Tyler, you know
how I feel about you.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.230
I think no matter what happens
in this competition,

41:05.330 --> 41:07.899
I think you and I are gonna be
friends for a really long time.

41:07.999 --> 41:11.570
You are like one of a kind.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.505
You're a one-of-a kind
human being.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.374
I do get a little bit concerned
sometimes, though.

41:16.875 --> 41:17.809
Fair.

41:17.909 --> 41:21.079
Because sometimes
you tell me things

41:21.179 --> 41:22.280
and I want to trust you.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.281
I wanna put all my trust
in your hands.

41:23.381 --> 41:24.315
But sometimes I hear things

41:24.415 --> 41:25.684
from other people and I'm like,

41:25.784 --> 41:27.853
"What? What?"

41:27.953 --> 41:29.320
"Like, actually what?"

41:29.420 --> 41:31.222
Because you tell me
one thing and I go

41:31.322 --> 41:32.624
and I hear another thing.

41:32.724 --> 41:35.426
So because of that, I'm sorry,

41:35.527 --> 41:37.763
you're gonna be up for
elimination tonight as well.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.165
I don't feel like it's fair
for me

41:40.265 --> 41:41.833
to go up on the chopping block

41:41.933 --> 41:43.569
because I had asked Josh
to cuddle.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.236
Being put up against Tyler,

41:45.336 --> 41:46.872
who obviously
should go home

41:46.972 --> 41:48.740
and then other people
in the back who are like,

41:48.840 --> 41:50.308
obviously should be
on the chopping block

41:50.408 --> 41:51.442
before I am.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.612
So I have a big decision to
make

41:54.079 --> 41:56.247
and I need to talk
to my dating coaches.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.149
So if you guys could
give me a minute,

41:58.249 --> 41:59.117
I'm gonna go talk to them.

41:59.217 --> 42:00.552
I'm gonna figure this out

42:00.652 --> 42:01.887
and I'll be right back.

42:02.688 --> 42:04.856
[Anthony] Seems like there's
been a bit of drama today,

42:04.956 --> 42:07.593
so let's sit down with Lexi
and see what's going on.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.964
-[Anthony] Okay
-[Spicy] Oh, Lexi.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.465
Guys, what do I do?

42:14.566 --> 42:15.400
You know, you're throwing
everyone--

42:15.500 --> 42:16.768
I know. I know.

42:16.868 --> 42:17.569
This is like...

42:17.669 --> 42:18.937
I-- I hope you know this.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.138
Like, 20 minutes ago,

42:20.238 --> 42:22.574
I was putting other people
up for elimination.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.109
-Wow.
-Twenty minutes.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.376
How did it switch
just like that?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.578
I heard some stuff.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.513
It-- it was like--
It really, like,

42:28.614 --> 42:29.581
It really concerned me.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.583
I heard from a couple people

42:31.683 --> 42:36.321
that Camille was trying to get
Josh to come to her.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.356
That's what I was told too.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.758
Yeah, like in the nighttime.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.594
Like she was like,
"I want to cuddle with Josh."

42:42.694 --> 42:44.262
-[Anthony] Yeah.
-And that like,

42:44.362 --> 42:45.463
she said it, like,
multiple times.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.398
-Wow.
-The entire day today,

42:47.498 --> 42:49.434
she was trying to throw Tyler
under the bus.

42:49.534 --> 42:51.002
-She was like.
-Like talking smack?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.838
Yeah, she said that Tyler

42:52.938 --> 42:58.810
said that he wanted to get
with both Jayme and Sienna.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.780
And so Tyler and I
are really close already.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.214
And that's why it was hard
for me

43:03.314 --> 43:04.482
to put him up
for elimination tonight.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.284
But I'm doing it
because I want him to see,

43:06.384 --> 43:07.819
like, how this made me feel.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.855
Do you feel like you trust him?

43:10.555 --> 43:12.758
I want to, like with every
soul.

43:12.858 --> 43:14.693
Like every part of my soul
wants to trust him.

43:14.793 --> 43:19.464
And I think-- I think
he has good intentions. I do.

43:19.564 --> 43:21.700
I think he, like--
I think he has good intentions.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.201
I think he's here
for the right reasons.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.970
But I think he's like
a huge flirt

43:25.070 --> 43:27.072
and sometimes I think
he lets it cross over.

43:27.172 --> 43:29.440
I also want to talk about Brian
because Brian is just like

43:29.540 --> 43:31.209
an anomaly in this situation.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.844
Like he didn't do
anything wrong.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.980
-But it's just I don't feel...
-Mm-hmm.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.614
Like I feel
a connection with Tyler.

43:36.715 --> 43:37.983
-I do.
-Do you-- Do you think you...

43:38.083 --> 43:39.751
I feel-- I even feel
a connection with Camille.

43:39.851 --> 43:42.187
Yeah. Do you think you could
ever feel that spark with Brian?

43:42.287 --> 43:43.321
I don't know.

43:43.421 --> 43:44.723
I don't know.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.826
But it all feels like
very friend.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.795
And see, he's worried
about getting friend-zoned.

43:49.895 --> 43:51.062
That was what
he was worried about.

43:51.162 --> 43:52.630
-Really?
-Yeah.

43:52.731 --> 43:55.066
But that's, I feel like
that's kind of like--

43:55.166 --> 43:57.202
-You've already boxed him
there. -Yeah.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.437
So my question for you is,

43:59.537 --> 44:01.740
out of those
three people right there,

44:01.840 --> 44:04.575
not whether, you know,

44:04.676 --> 44:08.146
you're not sure about
somebody's intentions,

44:08.246 --> 44:13.484
but who can you see
yourself long-term with

44:13.584 --> 44:15.453
out of those three?

44:15.553 --> 44:17.823
And who do you think,
out of those three,

44:17.923 --> 44:19.691
if you can see
something long-term with them,

44:19.791 --> 44:23.561
can possibly be resolved
during this time?

44:24.963 --> 44:28.633
This is gonna be-- this is gonna
be really difficult for me.

44:34.572 --> 44:35.941
So I just had

44:36.041 --> 44:38.844
a really helpful conversation
with my dating coaches.

44:38.944 --> 44:42.047
They talked to me about
some important things

44:42.147 --> 44:45.717
that helped me figure out how
I'm going to make this decision.

44:45.817 --> 44:48.920
When I tell you guys, I had
a different group of people

44:49.020 --> 44:51.689
up for elimination
about 20 minutes ago.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.491
Like, this is not easy.

44:54.259 --> 44:57.595
So I do have to make
a decision, though.

44:58.663 --> 45:01.632
I am eliminating this person,

45:01.733 --> 45:05.436
um, for a couple reasons,

45:05.536 --> 45:07.172
but mainly because I think

45:07.272 --> 45:11.342
the connection that I have
with them is not as strong

45:11.442 --> 45:15.113
as the connection that I have
with other people here.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.182
And I really wish that there
was more time for me

45:17.282 --> 45:18.817
to get to know them.

45:18.917 --> 45:22.687
But unfortunately, because
of those reasons, Brian...

45:24.022 --> 45:26.524
-you have been unmatched.
-[sighing]

45:26.624 --> 45:28.059
And I care about you so deeply.

45:28.159 --> 45:32.463
And I really want us to stay
in touch and remain friends

45:32.563 --> 45:35.600
because you are
an incredible soul.

45:36.034 --> 45:37.435
Can I please give you a hug?

45:37.836 --> 45:39.370
-Of course.
-[Lexi] Please.

45:39.470 --> 45:41.106
I'm really sorry.

45:41.206 --> 45:43.741
I got eliminated.

45:43.842 --> 45:45.443
I got eliminated.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.913
I wasn't even messing around
with anyone in the house.

45:48.013 --> 45:49.614
That's why I thought
I was so safe.

45:49.714 --> 45:51.616
But, like, you can't be safe.

45:51.716 --> 45:53.718
You know what I mean?
There's no way to be safe.

45:53.819 --> 45:55.686
[Tyler] I was so relieved,
but I felt bad.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.522
Brian hasn't
done anything.

45:57.622 --> 45:58.990
He's, like, such
a good, sweet guy.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.626
And I thought it was either me
or Camille, for sure.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.262
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh.

46:04.362 --> 46:07.698
-[Brian] Bye, y'all, bye.
-Love you so much.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.001
She's one of the first girls
I had feelings for,

46:10.101 --> 46:12.337
like, big time,
and so I don't understand.

46:12.437 --> 46:15.273
It's weird to catch feelings,
and I'm kind of more in tune

46:15.373 --> 46:16.341
with myself now.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.810
Maybe how I present feelings.

46:18.910 --> 46:20.678
But, Lexi,
if you're watching this,

46:20.778 --> 46:22.948
you made a little bit
of a mistake,

46:23.048 --> 46:26.117
but I-- I honestly wish you
the best finding someone.

46:26.217 --> 46:29.520
-I'll miss my dance partner.
-It's okay, guys.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.489
[indistinct chatter]

46:31.589 --> 46:34.759
-Bye, guys.
-[Kalysta] Bye, Brian.

46:36.995 --> 46:39.697
So I really appreciate all of
you having patience with me.

46:39.797 --> 46:43.168
I hope you guys know that these
decisions are not easy

46:43.268 --> 46:44.702
for me at all. Um...

46:44.802 --> 46:47.205
You guys are all amazing,
Amazing, amazing, amazing,

46:47.305 --> 46:48.473
amazing, amazing people.

46:48.573 --> 46:50.275
And I have so much love
for all of you.

46:50.375 --> 46:52.477
I can't wait to keep getting
to know all of you.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.412
So let's have fun tomorrow.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.848
Let's not think about
the next elimination round,

46:56.948 --> 46:58.683
um, and have a good night.

46:58.783 --> 47:00.185
I'll see you tomorrow.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.388
-Bye, guys.
-[clapping]

47:05.356 --> 47:07.258
Did you hear that I actually
leaned in to kiss Jayme?

47:07.358 --> 47:08.259
Is that what she said?

47:08.359 --> 47:09.494
That's what we're hearing.

47:09.594 --> 47:10.896
I did. I did hear that.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.664
There is a whole lot
of weird behaviors

47:13.764 --> 47:14.732
going on between them.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.401
Anything for Lexi.

47:17.102 --> 47:19.470
I can't tell you how bad it
hurts without [bleep] fuzz.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.206
You're used to
cuffs with fuzzies?

47:21.306 --> 47:22.307
[laughs]

47:22.407 --> 47:23.674
What the [bleep] is going on?

47:23.774 --> 47:26.777
Do you, like, just not
want me to, like,

47:26.878 --> 47:27.712
be interested in you at all?

47:27.812 --> 47:28.980
I didn't realize, like,

47:29.080 --> 47:30.748
how serious this was
to you guys,

47:30.848 --> 47:32.217
like all of you.
