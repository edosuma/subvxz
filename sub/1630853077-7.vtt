00:16.725 --> 00:19.478
Hola, amigos. Happy Cinco de Mayo.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.689
What do you call a cargo ship full of
mayonnaise that goes down in the ocean?

00:22.773 --> 00:23.774
Sink-o-da-mayo.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.817
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:25.901 --> 00:26.985
Such a bad joke.

00:27.069 --> 00:31.573
Anyways, today we're covering IPOs,
initial public offerings.

00:31.657 --> 00:35.452
An IPO is the process by which
a private company becomes a public one.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.330
For a founder, ultimate success
sounds like a ringing bell,

00:38.413 --> 00:41.875
specifically the opening bell
of the New York Stock Exchange.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.586
Uh-oh.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.133
Going public has many pros.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.052
But it's also got a big old con.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.849
The risk that the IPO could fail.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.519
IPO is the make-or-break moment.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.437
It separates the winners from the losers.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.313
The Googles from the Groupons.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.692
The Amazons from the Pet.coms.

01:06.775 --> 01:11.154
Going public means that you are
literally going public.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.907
Joe Ordinary gets to see
your dirty laundry,

01:13.991 --> 01:15.325
skid marks and all.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.535
How've you been running your company?

01:16.618 --> 01:19.371
How much have you actually
been making? Or losing?

01:19.454 --> 01:23.000
Which is why some founders try to keep
the enemy outside the gate

01:23.083 --> 01:24.334
for as long as possible.

01:24.418 --> 01:28.547
You shall not pass!

02:47.251 --> 02:49.795
My assistant was
supposed to put it together,

02:49.878 --> 02:52.881
but he twisted his ankle
this morning, or broke it.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.424
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.218
He tripped over the suitcases.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.679
My other assistant took him to the ER.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.849
Which is okay, because we adjust.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.977
We adapt. We improvise! Right?

03:05.060 --> 03:09.231
I don't know if anyone told you,
but it's my superpower.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.358
Change.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.152
Why are you coming to us?

03:15.571 --> 03:18.532
Because you have all the money, huh?

03:24.621 --> 03:27.249
WeWork is a…

03:28.333 --> 03:30.002
It's a family business.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.212
And we're at our strongest

03:32.296 --> 03:36.258
when we find the right partners
to join the family. You understand?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.427
I still don't see
how you're a tech company.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.513
The point of the model is to demonstrate

03:41.597 --> 03:44.683
how tech drives workplace insights.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.561
Yeah, which conference rooms
are being booked.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.480
If space is being used efficiently.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.482
Efficiency is…

03:52.566 --> 03:53.984
That's Google.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.444
Why are you coming to us?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.696
Why not SoftBank?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.949
SoftBank remains wildly committed.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.577
Adam, sorry. Why not just IPO?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.259
How sweet was that?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.930
Well, the kids were great,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.099
but everything else was embarrassing.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.560
Teachers' shoes should be
white, black, or beige,

05:09.643 --> 05:12.437
and for God's sakes no laces.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.648
Ms. Myers is a stress-dream
on that tambourine.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.484
How do you not know how to play
a tambourine? It's a tambourine.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.737
And don't even get me started
on the pitch of Mr. Ivey's voice.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.035
Feel free to start writing this down
whenever it suits you, Bea.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.038
That you don't like
the pitch of Mr. Ivey's voice?

05:30.122 --> 05:31.123
Yes.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.709
God, you'd think that in New York
you could find a teacher

05:33.792 --> 05:35.919
that could both sing and teach.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.047
I'm ready to move on to action items.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.591
-Are you?
-Ready.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.467
I rechecked the website this morning.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.928
Tell Gavin I'm still finding
placeholder text

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
and Helvetica.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.849
Not acceptable.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.101
I called the front desk line at 11:23.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.437
No one answered.
Five rings, straight to voice mail.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.314
Tell Lisa that's not acceptable.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.983
Set a meeting with Nicole
re: expansion plans

05:58.066 --> 06:00.527
for WeGrow San Fran and Tel Aviv,

06:00.611 --> 06:03.488
the pace of scholarship funding,
which is just…

06:04.072 --> 06:05.866
…and the lemonade stand.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.284
So…

06:08.035 --> 06:09.328
The lemonade stand.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.080
We're gonna take kids to our farm

06:12.164 --> 06:14.124
and then have them pick vegetables,

06:14.208 --> 06:15.542
sell them to WeWork employees.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.212
It's gonna be the lemonade stand
for the 21st century.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.838
Conscious entrepreneurship.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.883
Entrepreneurship for five-year-olds?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.303
I just heard it too.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.387
You're right.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.349
We'll include the younger kids.
But you have to order the car seats.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.851
Where are the admission certificates
for next year's class?

06:32.935 --> 06:34.645
I have them, but there's a typo.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.230
It says, "Class of 2031."

06:36.313 --> 06:37.397
No, that's right.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.025
That's when they're gonna graduate
from WeGrow High School.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.402
Of course.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.695
I'll sign them.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.368
I'm not just going to abandon kids
to normative education experiences, Bea.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.620
I wanna educate them from birth to death.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.790
What about that for a slogan?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.208
"From birth to death."

06:58.418 --> 07:00.379
-Yeah.
-Can you mock that up on a banner?

07:00.462 --> 07:02.297
So that way I could see it.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.423
Great. That's it.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.300
Okay.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.296
Adam.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.340
You've been in the Valley for a week.
Nobody's coming in.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.343
It's time. You have to IPO.

08:00.272 --> 08:04.234
Motek. I tried to make it back
in time for us to have breakfast together,

08:04.318 --> 08:06.028
but you're up so early.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.157
How about I make a tofu scramble

08:10.240 --> 08:12.242
and some green juice to start your day?

08:12.326 --> 08:15.370
If you'll excuse me. I have to go
run the school that you gave me.

08:15.454 --> 08:18.415
-I didn't mean it to come out that way--
-I know you don't think I do anything.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.625
But I actually do.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.546
-Motek. Please.
-No, no. You made it perfectly clear.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.300
-Motek--
-My therapist said,

08:28.383 --> 08:30.511
"You can only hate someone
you truly love."

08:31.386 --> 08:32.971
Guess I truly love you.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.938
And how are you gonna get this
back on track?

08:42.481 --> 08:43.482
Adam?

08:44.525 --> 08:46.401
Who said we're off track?

08:46.485 --> 08:48.904
We're on exactly the right track, Jamie.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.323
The track the universe wants us to be on.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.326
-So, no luck in the Valley?
-They lack vision.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.455
By the way, I'm going to need
to increase our personal line of credit.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.083
Not by much. Just a bit
to give us a little breathing room.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.377
What are you up to, total?

09:03.460 --> 09:05.295
380 million.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.423
Nothing for you to do.
I'll speak to the lending team myself.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.720
And what's WeWork's burn rate these days?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.098
Fifty-eight million a week.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.724
That's a lot of money.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.852
Not compared to what we'll make.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.354
Well…

09:24.022 --> 09:26.233
We've issued you, personally, what?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.986
Ninety-seven million
in low-interest mortgages?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.363
Bought a stake in the company.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.408
A stake that is now worth
over 600 million.

09:35.868 --> 09:36.952
Why not go public?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.454
Why not IPO?

09:43.458 --> 09:45.210
I don't want to answer to anyone.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.089
Well, billions of dollars tend
to make that go down easier.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.394
All these different shapes.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.065
This leaf here, what is this one?

10:07.149 --> 10:10.777
Bloom Energy. Traded up more than 66%
on the first day of trading.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.488
Wow, 66% on the first day?

10:15.616 --> 10:16.617
And this?

10:16.700 --> 10:20.245
Dropbox. Up more than 35%, first day.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.955
Impressive.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.375
And what would mine be?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.634
A unicorn.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.387
A unicorn.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.777
Okay. The next item up is…

10:53.028 --> 10:54.321
Enrollment.

10:54.404 --> 10:58.033
The numbers are dispiriting.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.995
They're just not where I need them to be.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.457
So, how do we boost enrollment?

11:10.921 --> 11:13.423
We could revamp our social strategy.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.634
What social strategy?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.553
There's nothing to revamp, Damian.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.013
We have 600 followers, okay? No.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.183
We need to think bigger.
We need to reach a wider audience.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.477
You were invited on that podcast.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.646
Interesting.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.275
Yeah, if you think that going
from Vanity Fair to a podcast

11:31.358 --> 11:32.484
is the right trajectory

11:32.568 --> 11:35.988
for the chief branding officer
of a multi-billion-dollar company, great.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.241
I was actually thinking CNBC.

11:39.950 --> 11:44.037
Right? Adam is on every other week.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.205
They love WeWork.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.916
This is WeWork's newest,
boldest initiative,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.835
reimagining the education system.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.504
And they're getting
an exclusive with the CEO.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.133
Adam's schedule is kind of packed.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.761
No. No, Damian. No. Me.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.471
I am the CEO of WeGrow.

12:02.431 --> 12:06.351
Okay. So, let them know
that I'm gonna tease our expansion plans,

12:06.935 --> 12:10.022
I'm gonna talk about our global network
of schools, the innovation in our--

12:10.105 --> 12:12.107
Welcome to
the School of Greatness podcast.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.151
I've got Rebekah Neumann in the house,

12:14.234 --> 12:17.196
wife of WeWork founder Adam Neumann.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.031
Actually, I'm…

12:20.365 --> 12:21.825
thrilled to be here. Thank you.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.368
The mission of WeGrow

12:23.452 --> 12:27.122
and, to be honest, the collective "we"
that we're all living under,

12:27.206 --> 12:29.583
is to elevate the world's consciousness.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.293
And it's a school, right?

12:32.628 --> 12:34.880
It's really more of a practice

12:34.963 --> 12:36.632
and a new approach to life.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.717
How were you inspired to do this?

12:39.218 --> 12:40.219
Gosh.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.347
It was really just a lot of things
coming together.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.474
He ended up running off
with my best friend.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.683
No.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.436
Something I wish people knew about me?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.106
I'm really…

12:54.316 --> 12:55.734
flexible?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.028
-Emotionally?
-Physically.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.491
A yogi in India once told me

13:02.574 --> 13:05.786
if you keep your spine nimble
then you won't age.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.455
Is that why you look 21?

13:08.539 --> 13:09.831
Do I hate?

13:10.415 --> 13:11.416
No.

13:12.918 --> 13:17.798
No, I feel sad about things I've--

13:19.383 --> 13:20.634
Like about what?

13:21.260 --> 13:22.511
Any cruelty.

13:24.388 --> 13:26.014
Cruelty to animals.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.351
Kids suffering.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.314
What we're doing to the planet.

13:34.398 --> 13:37.651
But I don't hate.

13:37.734 --> 13:42.781
If we can teach people to--
And I'm including myself in this.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.284
I remind myself every day

13:45.367 --> 13:49.621
that by being conscious and sharing,

13:50.122 --> 13:52.624
they will be more fulfilled.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.418
Find your super passion

13:55.043 --> 13:57.754
and share.

13:58.547 --> 14:02.384
And then they will get
everything they want,

14:02.885 --> 14:06.722
but they have to treat others
the way they want to be treated.

14:07.222 --> 14:13.187
They have to understand that we are one.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.531
Miggy-Migs.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.950
My brother from five different mothers.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.077
Can I come in?

14:30.579 --> 14:31.580
Yeah.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.587
You've got a Lichtenstein.

14:38.670 --> 14:43.217
Wow, it's a lot smaller
than I thought it would be.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.885
What did you pay for it?

14:47.179 --> 14:49.348
Twenty dollars from posters.com.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.852
We need to get you
some real art, my friend.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.062
Some real art.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.695
Miguel.

15:04.655 --> 15:05.864
Look out there.

15:06.949 --> 15:07.950
Look.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.494
We built this.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.497
This big, beautiful thing.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.917
We built it,
and they all came and joined us.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.965
I know that you think
I don't listen to you, but I do.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.758
I hear you.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.344
What does that mean?

15:28.887 --> 15:29.888
You'll see.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.385
-Well, it's official.
-It's official!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.888
-You filed!
-Yes, we filed. We're going public.

16:10.971 --> 16:15.142
-WeWork is going public.
-The We Company is going public.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.780
Time to go buy yourself
some real art, Miguel.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.242
What made you decide you were ready?

16:32.326 --> 16:34.036
We've always been ready.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.996
It was just simply a matter of timing.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.168
Okay, 72 hours to figure out
how much they're worth.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.378
100 million in fees for us. Go.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.843
Let's talk about the financials for a sec.

16:49.927 --> 16:53.514
Now, you didn't reveal any financial
information in the confidential filing.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.432
In the presentation you shared with us

16:55.516 --> 17:00.437
we see that revenue climbed
to $1.8 billion in 2017.

17:00.521 --> 17:03.607
But that was on a net loss of 1.9.

17:04.148 --> 17:11.073
But we reached an annualized revenue
of 2.43 billion in the fourth quarter.

17:12.491 --> 17:13.534
Go.

17:22.376 --> 17:25.170
And we saw a massive jump in membership

17:25.253 --> 17:29.466
from 186,000 to 401,000.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.804
Uber, Lyft, Pinterest,
Slack, and now WeWork.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.430
The We Company. Yeah.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.516
-The We Company.
-Thank you very much.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.853
Sorry about that.
All preparing to go public this year.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.605
And they're calling it
"the unicorn stampede."

17:43.689 --> 17:46.024
We are rooting for everyone's success.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.317
There's no reason not to.

17:47.401 --> 17:51.697
We feel very confident
about investor demand for our IPO.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.615
Okay.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.743
Let's do it.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.459
It's the right time
for the mission of the company.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.049
-Which is?
-To elevate the world's consciousness.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.803
And going public will help us
to achieve that mission.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.557
Oh, my God. It's so exciting.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.603
Can I get a tea?

18:23.228 --> 18:24.354
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.784
Mother Teresa.

18:38.702 --> 18:39.703
Bob Marley.

18:40.454 --> 18:41.496
Adam Neumann.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.084
Your goal to elevate the world's
consciousness reminds us of these icons.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.171
"Love the life you live.
Live the life you love."

18:49.671 --> 18:52.424
Bob Marley. Rest in power.

18:53.342 --> 18:57.846
The only difference between you
and Amazon and Google and Alibaba

18:57.930 --> 18:59.848
is that you are scaling faster.

19:00.766 --> 19:03.852
We are best in class,
and the best deserves the best.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.813
I feel like I know what you value, Adam.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.273
Personal relationships.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.486
And I think you already know
we are the bank to lead the underwriting.

19:12.569 --> 19:16.114
Jamie, I value you more than you know.

19:16.198 --> 19:20.410
The question is, how much do you value me?

19:28.126 --> 19:30.087
Forty-six billion.

19:31.046 --> 19:35.175
Our last financing round valued us
at 47 billion.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.760
No, you're too low, my friend.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.179
Too low. It's a shame.

19:40.639 --> 19:41.890
Eighteen to 52.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.016
"Eighteen to 52"?

19:43.100 --> 19:45.269
Well, it depends on
how well we're able to--

19:46.144 --> 19:47.312
Sixty billion?

19:49.273 --> 19:51.859
The question is, why so low?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.197
We actually think it's on the high side.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.450
Sixty-three.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.211
Add 18 cents…

20:12.504 --> 20:13.755
and you have a deal.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.760
I think it's a fair number
for our investors

20:18.844 --> 20:20.762
and for our future investors

20:20.846 --> 20:22.764
and, most importantly,

20:24.349 --> 20:25.434
for our employees.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.646
Now, let's make a shit ton of money.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.857
Okay? Shit ton.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.650
All right.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.779
So, we'll work with your team
to get started on the S-1 prospectus.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.991
It's WeWork's introduction--
official introduction to the public,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.202
so it's one of the most
important parts of the process.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.120
-We'll get ahead of it.
-Yes, please.

20:45.204 --> 20:48.874
Write it,
and then I'll give it energy and power.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.835
Adam, it's an important
legal and financial document.

20:51.919 --> 20:54.129
-We'll let the experts deal with it.
-I understand.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.339
Miguel is right, Adam.

20:55.422 --> 20:59.009
It's highly-technical.
Reporting requirements, legal liabilities.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.595
-You don't wanna be a part of that.
-Listen to me.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.224
That is the old way.
I'm not interested in the old way.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.267
I'm interested in the world to come.

21:07.351 --> 21:09.436
You understand? We're making a new world.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.021
A new world, Miguel.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.108
Have your people put something together,
and we'll take it from there.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.818
Okay?

21:18.737 --> 21:19.738
Thank you.

21:23.492 --> 21:24.576
Shit.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.370
What's wrong?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.121
I think we could have gotten 64.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.458
Come on.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.168
-Yes! It's a good deal.
-Yes! Yes!

21:33.252 --> 21:34.920
-Yes!
-Yes!

21:35.003 --> 21:36.004
Yes!

21:37.756 --> 21:39.883
Yes! Yes!

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
Rivka.

22:03.991 --> 22:06.285
Rivka, come sit with me, please.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.832
I'm not asking as your husband,
I'm asking as your CEO.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.834
This is business. Please, come sit.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.711
Please.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.466
Just a quick sit.

22:26.555 --> 22:27.556
I appreciate it.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.434
Carrot juice.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.487
Do you know what an S-1 is?

22:43.780 --> 22:46.909
I worked on Wall Street, Adam.
I know what an S-1 is.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.827
It's a company's introduction
to the world.

22:48.911 --> 22:51.330
Its mission statement. Its raison d'être.

22:52.206 --> 22:53.290
Precisely.

22:53.832 --> 22:57.002
The lawyers and the bankers will debate
the fine print,

22:57.085 --> 22:58.587
but we need to make it our own.

22:58.670 --> 23:02.007
It's got to be a living, breathing thing,

23:02.090 --> 23:05.677
and it must tell the story of We.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.141
And We has always been…

23:13.227 --> 23:14.269
you and me.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.648
Write it with me.

23:27.991 --> 23:28.992
No.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.664
You built the company.
You can write it yourself.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.215
I saw the podcast that you did.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.300
I thought you were phenomenal.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.511
It was a podcast. It doesn't matter.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.305
Of course it matters. It was important.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.308
Damian tells me

23:53.392 --> 23:56.812
that you don't think your message
is reaching a wide enough audience.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.146
I agree.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.440
You want to get your message out there?

24:00.524 --> 24:02.568
You want to grow your school?

24:02.651 --> 24:03.694
You want to be heard?

24:03.777 --> 24:05.696
Then write the S-1 with me.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.240
Not as my wife…

24:10.033 --> 24:11.159
but as my cofounder.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.455
It'll be hard for them not to listen

24:15.539 --> 24:18.584
to the cofounder
of a multi-billion-dollar company.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.215
I heard 100.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.050
Goldman pitched a trillion.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.344
Listen to me. Buy your options now.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.014
-Forget options. I'm buying an apartment.
-I'm paying off student loans.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.308
I'm cashing out
and getting the hell out of here.

24:34.391 --> 24:35.267
No, I am serious.

24:35.350 --> 24:38.312
Listen, it'll reduce the capital gains tax
when you sell your shares.

24:38.395 --> 24:40.731
But I don't have any money.
How do I buy my options?

24:41.481 --> 24:43.233
I got a loan from my grandparents.

24:43.734 --> 24:44.985
-Of course you did.
-Yeah.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.488
Attention!
Attention, my beautiful WeWorkers.

24:48.572 --> 24:49.865
My tribe. My family.

24:50.449 --> 24:53.785
You have the rest of the day off.
And tomorrow.

24:53.869 --> 24:57.539
So water your plants.
Call your mother. Go for a walk.

24:57.623 --> 24:58.624
Fall in love.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.792
But whatever you do, get out of here.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.419
Go, go, go. Okay?

25:03.003 --> 25:04.546
-Thank you. Go.
-Is he serious?

25:04.630 --> 25:05.923
He's not fucking around.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.094
I feel like this is a test.

25:14.890 --> 25:15.891
All right.

25:36.662 --> 25:37.829
Where is everyone?

25:39.748 --> 25:42.751
We gave them the day off. Actually, two.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.920
Besides, we have everyone
we need right here.

25:45.003 --> 25:46.797
No distractions, no noise.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.131
Just us.

25:57.558 --> 26:01.395
I had Bea print out the S-1s
from the top IPOs of the last ten years.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.938
I'm gonna get reading.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.942
I don't think they
have anything to teach us.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.485
I'll be in my office.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.905
How about some yoga first?

26:12.781 --> 26:15.701
Maybe limber up a bit?

26:27.337 --> 26:28.547
Latte?

26:31.633 --> 26:33.093
That's a cappuccino.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.429
Pretty sure it's a latte.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.098
It's a cappuccino.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.187
My assistants call them lattes.

26:43.270 --> 26:46.481
Because you call them lattes, and no one
wants to tell you that you're wrong.

27:12.007 --> 27:13.675
Tell me what to do,

27:13.759 --> 27:16.345
because a thousand apologies
haven't worked.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.765
How do we get past it?

27:24.353 --> 27:26.396
We don't. It forever exists.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.192
So, this is it?

27:31.443 --> 27:34.112
-This?
-You really think you built this alone?

27:34.196 --> 27:35.322
Really?

27:35.906 --> 27:38.283
You gave me a theater, you gave me a job,

27:38.367 --> 27:40.244
you gave me a school--

27:41.954 --> 27:43.789
What about what you took?

27:46.124 --> 27:47.918
You took my father's money.

27:48.001 --> 27:51.380
You took everything I believe in

27:51.463 --> 27:54.675
and made it into a shiny wrapper
to package your bullshit.

27:54.758 --> 27:57.469
You even took my words.

27:57.553 --> 27:59.304
"Elevating the world's consciousness."

27:59.388 --> 28:01.223
Who came up with that? You?

28:02.599 --> 28:05.936
You couldn't have built shit without me.

28:13.735 --> 28:14.820
You're right.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.488
They are your words.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.991
But do you mean them?

28:21.869 --> 28:23.954
How can you elevate
the world's consciousness

28:24.037 --> 28:25.956
if you're not willing to forgive?

28:35.299 --> 28:36.800
There's your cappuccino.

29:01.074 --> 29:01.909
-Hi.
-Hello. Welcome.

29:01.992 --> 29:02.826
Thank you.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.912
-It's lovely to have you here.
-Thanks.

29:04.995 --> 29:05.996
Thanks.

29:08.832 --> 29:11.418
So here we have the piece
you were inquiring about.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.262
He's challenging us to ask ourselves,

29:22.888 --> 29:24.890
"What is worth our time and attention?"

29:28.101 --> 29:29.102
Yeah, it's cool.

29:32.773 --> 29:35.150
I feel like he's staring right at me.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.111
So, how much is it?

29:39.571 --> 29:41.740
Adam and Rebekah have been
our clients for years,

29:41.823 --> 29:44.034
so we'd like to extend
their discount to you.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.203
Cool, thank you.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.121
Yeah, so 48 million.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.335
That's with the discount?

29:53.418 --> 29:55.462
I heard you'll be able to afford it soon.

29:55.963 --> 29:58.841
Adam mentioned the IPO. Congratulations.

30:05.222 --> 30:06.390
What about that one?

30:09.059 --> 30:10.602
You're interested in that one?

30:42.217 --> 30:43.260
You were right.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.433
They're useless.

30:50.225 --> 30:51.226
Lifeless.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.312
Dead things.

30:53.395 --> 30:56.064
They reminded me why I hated
working on Wall Street.

31:00.569 --> 31:01.737
What's that?

31:02.905 --> 31:05.949
These? More dead things from the lawyers.

31:06.909 --> 31:07.951
Take a look.

31:09.578 --> 31:10.787
Risk factors?

31:12.289 --> 31:15.876
"One, our rapid growth
may not be sustainable.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.587
Two, we have a history of losses,

31:18.670 --> 31:21.548
and if we continue to grow
at an accelerated rate,

31:21.632 --> 31:25.636
we may be unable to achieve profitability
for the foreseeable future."

31:25.719 --> 31:27.262
And number three:

31:27.346 --> 31:32.935
small men proceed from fear!

31:39.441 --> 31:43.862
And we are not small!

31:45.113 --> 31:47.157
No, and we proceed from hope,

31:47.658 --> 31:50.536
from creativity, imagination and--

31:51.578 --> 31:54.248
and from love.

31:56.416 --> 32:00.212
Okay. So how do we capture that?

32:04.299 --> 32:07.261
Creation began with the word, right?

32:08.262 --> 32:09.888
So, what are our words?

32:12.391 --> 32:13.392
Come.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.061
Come, come, come.

32:29.116 --> 32:30.158
The word.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.252
Community.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.887
Consciousness.

32:52.431 --> 32:53.724
Growth.

32:55.684 --> 32:57.477
Spiritual growth!

32:59.771 --> 33:01.940
Intention!

33:02.649 --> 33:04.234
-Positivity.
-Meaning.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.444
Hope!

33:07.029 --> 33:08.655
-We.
-We!

33:16.747 --> 33:18.832
I am nothing without you.

33:30.677 --> 33:31.678
Adam, it's Bruce.

33:31.762 --> 33:35.891
What is this nonsense I'm hearing
about you and Rebekah rewriting the S-1?

33:36.475 --> 33:39.061
It's a very technical document and--

33:39.144 --> 33:41.647
You know what? I'm coming over.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.369
Hello!

33:59.873 --> 34:01.583
How many pages do we have?

34:02.251 --> 34:04.127
We have…

34:04.211 --> 34:06.588
-nine words.
-Nine words?

34:06.672 --> 34:07.840
Nine words!

34:08.924 --> 34:10.342
It can't be true.

34:13.428 --> 34:16.389
Okay, okay, okay.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.600
We have our words.

34:18.684 --> 34:21.562
And now we need numbers.

34:22.312 --> 34:25.065
Fortunately, the only numbers
that Wall Street cares about

34:25.148 --> 34:26.275
are actually letters.

34:26.358 --> 34:29.319
E-B-I-T-D-A, EBITDA.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.612
EBITDA.

34:30.696 --> 34:35.242
Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.161
EBITDA is a standardized way
of assessing a company's performance

34:38.245 --> 34:40.246
and comparing it to other companies.

34:40.330 --> 34:43.876
Its power lies in the fact
that everyone uses it.

34:45.168 --> 34:48.797
And because everyone uses it,
it allows you to compare apples to apples.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.636
-Fuck EBITDA!
-Why?

34:54.719 --> 34:56.263
We lose too much money.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.807
We could be profitable
tomorrow if we wanted,

34:58.891 --> 35:01.143
but we spend on growth.

35:01.852 --> 35:02.936
So?

35:03.687 --> 35:05.814
They're just letters.
Let's use different ones.

35:05.898 --> 35:06.899
Let's reframe it.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.776
We can't let ourselves be defined
by the old ways.

35:09.860 --> 35:12.654
If their letters don't fit,
we come up with new ones.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.201
What did you just say?

35:17.284 --> 35:18.410
We use new ones.

35:18.994 --> 35:21.955
-Where is the S-1?
-Here.

35:26.001 --> 35:28.587
We'll work off the S-1
the lawyers gave us,

35:28.670 --> 35:33.133
and then we just need to subtract
tenant fees and rent expenses,

35:33.217 --> 35:35.594
staffing expenses and design expenses,

35:35.677 --> 35:38.263
marketing and administrative expenses.

35:38.347 --> 35:39.765
Then we show a profit.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.684
We'll call it community-adjusted EBITDA.

35:42.768 --> 35:46.355
And show them, show them
the true value of our community!

35:46.438 --> 35:49.066
Okay. Okay, could you say that again?

35:53.487 --> 35:54.571
Okay, yep.

35:56.323 --> 35:57.491
A little to the right.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.160
Right, right. Cool. Great, guys.

36:00.244 --> 36:02.079
Awesome. All right, let's do a photo.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.039
You guys can be in it. Yeah.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.127
Hey, my brother from another mother.

36:11.380 --> 36:13.715
I didn't buy the Lichtenstein,

36:13.799 --> 36:16.677
but I got something even better.

36:21.223 --> 36:22.391
And

36:23.392 --> 36:25.185
if you need any help with the S-1,

36:26.228 --> 36:27.521
I'm here.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.898
Yo! This is it.

36:30.732 --> 36:33.610
This is our home for the evening.

36:34.152 --> 36:37.197
-Check it out. Come on.
-Should I take off my shoes?

36:37.281 --> 36:39.324
No, don't take your fucking shoes off.

36:39.408 --> 36:41.243
I thought we were just
getting Adam's mail.

36:41.326 --> 36:44.454
Come here. I want you to touch this.
Actually, I want you to hold it.

36:44.538 --> 36:45.622
-Put that down.
-Hold it.

36:45.706 --> 36:47.165
-Put it down.
-Or I drop it.

36:47.875 --> 36:48.876
How's it feel?

36:50.419 --> 36:52.254
-It feels fine.
-It feels great.

36:52.337 --> 36:53.589
Come on, let's drink it.

36:54.089 --> 36:56.049
I don't know. I'm worried.
What if they come back?

36:56.133 --> 36:58.760
-Yeah, I'm not sure about this.
-Stop worrying.

36:58.844 --> 36:59.845
Adam doesn't even care.

36:59.928 --> 37:04.099
Plus, put the kids and the nannies
on a blade to the Hamptons.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.184
So we're fine.

37:05.267 --> 37:06.310
Like a helicopter?

37:06.393 --> 37:08.145
-Yeah, what else is there?
-Wow.

37:08.228 --> 37:09.563
Let's see what we got.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.065
Vegan snacks.

37:12.149 --> 37:15.777
My dad used to mark the bottles
so he'd know if me or my sister drank any.

37:15.861 --> 37:16.862
We're not teenagers anymore.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.072
You're a grown-ass dude
who's about to be a millionaire.

37:19.156 --> 37:20.824
-So act like it.
-Yeah, Mikey.

37:20.908 --> 37:24.703
Plus, I once found an $84,000 check
in Adam's pants at the dry cleaner's.

37:24.786 --> 37:27.831
So something tells me
he's not measuring alcohol.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.833
Okay, grab one.

37:30.751 --> 37:31.960
What are we cheersing to?

37:33.795 --> 37:34.838
This IPO.

37:34.922 --> 37:36.840
-This fucking IPO.
-Yeah.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.050
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.843
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Yeah.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.265
-Wow.
-Wow.

37:45.349 --> 37:46.767
Okay, so.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.938
Chloe, what are you spending
your first million on?

37:51.021 --> 37:52.856
And do not give me anything

37:52.940 --> 37:55.484
about student loans
or any of that nonsense.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.236
You know I don't need anything.

37:57.319 --> 37:58.737
Yeah, nobody needs anything.

37:58.820 --> 38:00.239
But, Chloe…

38:00.948 --> 38:02.241
Chloe…

38:02.324 --> 38:04.910
-Please, no.
-What do you want, Chloe?

38:04.993 --> 38:06.078
What do you want?

38:06.161 --> 38:08.330
-You're terrorizing me--
-Stare into my soul.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.749
If you want nice things,
you need to have intention.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.793
Intention.

38:12.876 --> 38:15.629
And success and happiness, it will follow.

38:15.712 --> 38:18.841
Chloe, don't you want to expand
the world's consciousness, Chloe?

38:18.924 --> 38:21.426
-Elevate, Chloe! Think about the "we."
-No!

38:21.510 --> 38:23.011
-Chlo-We.
-Chlo-We!

38:23.095 --> 38:25.013
It's Chlo-We.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.517
Wow.

38:29.226 --> 38:32.437
Hey. Don't you dare avoid the question.

38:33.522 --> 38:35.023
What're you gonna buy? I want to know.

38:41.822 --> 38:43.365
Do you ever think
you're turning into Adam?

38:43.448 --> 38:44.783
-Don't say that.
-You are.

38:44.867 --> 38:46.618
Are you actually saying
I'm turning into Adam?

38:46.702 --> 38:47.744
I don't think so.

38:56.545 --> 38:57.546
-You use salt?
-Yeah.

38:57.629 --> 38:58.463
Drink.

38:58.547 --> 39:00.674
-Yeah.
-Wait. One, two, three, go.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.474
-Do you want to make out?
-No.

39:09.558 --> 39:12.186
-Don't you just a little bit?
-No.

39:12.895 --> 39:14.271
We just struck gold.

39:17.858 --> 39:21.361
Do it! Do it! Do it!

39:21.445 --> 39:25.073
Do it! Do it! Do it!

39:25.157 --> 39:27.451
Come on, you can pay it off
in installments.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.995
It's more than I made
last year after taxes.

39:30.078 --> 39:31.997
Yeah, but we didn't IPO last year, dude.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.875
Hey, man, check it out.
This place is huge.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.377
They added a whole floor
since the last time I was here.

39:37.461 --> 39:40.797
Yeah. And the San Francisco house
has a room that's shaped like a guitar.

39:40.881 --> 39:42.633
I bet they have orgies in it.

39:42.716 --> 39:44.635
No. They do not have sex.

39:44.718 --> 39:47.721
They just levitate,
and their souls fucking meld.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.099
Did you buy it?

39:51.767 --> 39:53.519
No, I'm just staring at it.

39:58.482 --> 39:59.816
It's Adam.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.527
-Why is he FaceTiming me?
-What?

40:01.610 --> 40:03.028
-Why is he FaceTiming me?
-No, Mikey.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.112
Don't pick it up.

40:04.196 --> 40:06.156
-He doesn't know that we're here.
-Asshole.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.241
I have to answer.

40:07.324 --> 40:08.700
-Smash your phone!
-You do not have to answer it.

40:08.784 --> 40:11.161
-I have to answer it.
-Do not answer it under any circumstance.

40:11.745 --> 40:12.871
Shit, turn off the music.

40:12.955 --> 40:13.997
Hey, Adam. What's up?

40:14.081 --> 40:15.832
The printer isn't working.

40:15.916 --> 40:19.294
Okay. You can try to reset it.
Remember how I showed you last time?

40:19.378 --> 40:20.212
See you soon.

40:20.921 --> 40:23.090
The fuck does that mean? "See you soon"?

40:24.508 --> 40:26.885
-Clean up and get out!
-Come on, are you joking?

40:27.386 --> 40:29.096
Buy the bag.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.514
-Yeah, yeah.
-See ya!

40:30.597 --> 40:32.975
-I love y'all. See y'all tomorrow.
-No! What the--

40:33.058 --> 40:35.686
-No. Come on. Goddamn it.
-Love you, bro.

40:41.525 --> 40:43.235
Hey!

40:43.318 --> 40:45.404
Someone probably stepped
on the surge protector.

40:45.487 --> 40:47.281
Mikey, you're a genius.

40:48.448 --> 40:49.700
You're a good boy.

40:50.450 --> 40:53.245
You've been with us from
the beginning, huh?

40:53.328 --> 40:55.330
-Yeah.
-The very beginning.

40:55.414 --> 40:57.165
What, ten years now?

40:57.249 --> 40:59.042
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

41:06.925 --> 41:07.926
Mikey.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.804
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.599
Have you been drinking?

41:16.059 --> 41:17.728
I had a drink with some friends.

41:19.771 --> 41:22.149
A drink with friends?

41:24.985 --> 41:26.361
I know that smell.

41:27.404 --> 41:28.405
Tequila.

41:29.781 --> 41:30.782
Tequila.

41:32.117 --> 41:34.077
-Am I right, or am I right?
-Yeah, you're right.

41:35.954 --> 41:36.997
You like tequila?

41:37.789 --> 41:38.790
-Yes?
-Yeah.

41:38.874 --> 41:41.543
Yes. Well, I don't blame you.

41:43.462 --> 41:45.255
You got to try the good stuff.

41:46.215 --> 41:48.175
Come with me. Come, come.

41:48.675 --> 41:49.968
Come with me, Mikey.

41:51.678 --> 41:53.805
I'd join you, but

41:55.140 --> 41:56.767
I'm on a cleanse.

41:56.850 --> 41:58.143
A cleanse. That's cool.

41:58.977 --> 42:00.103
Well…

42:01.188 --> 42:02.648
You're 21, right?

42:03.232 --> 42:06.026
-I'm almost 26.
-Right? Okay, you look like a baby.

42:11.823 --> 42:14.326
Savor it. Savor it.

42:14.409 --> 42:15.619
-Here.
-I'm sorry.

42:15.702 --> 42:17.538
-Have another.
-Force of habit.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.208
Now.

42:21.291 --> 42:23.752
Sip it, slowly.

42:23.836 --> 42:25.003
Savor it.

42:26.588 --> 42:27.756
Tell me what you taste.

42:32.135 --> 42:33.512
There's notes of…

42:35.514 --> 42:36.723
charcoal?

42:37.224 --> 42:38.517
Mikey.

42:39.393 --> 42:40.769
It tastes like money.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.276
How many shares do you have?

42:48.068 --> 42:49.903
Close to 80,000.

42:49.987 --> 42:51.154
80,000?

42:51.238 --> 42:54.283
Well, Mikey, when we IPO,

42:55.367 --> 42:58.203
you'll be worth 30 mil, minimum.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.916
Time to start getting used to
the nice things in life, Mikey.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.126
Here, it's yours.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.795
Take it. Enjoy. It's yours.

43:07.379 --> 43:08.380
It's a memory.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.218
Rivka!

43:13.302 --> 43:14.595
Namaste.

43:14.678 --> 43:17.598
Mikey has been with us
since the very beginning, as you know.

43:17.681 --> 43:19.057
Ten years now?

43:19.141 --> 43:20.142
-Ten years!
-Yeah.

43:20.225 --> 43:22.019
-Really? That's wonderful.
-Ten years.

43:22.102 --> 43:23.937
Yes, yeah.

43:24.021 --> 43:26.064
We should probably get back to it.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.733
-Of course.
-Remember that first night?

43:27.816 --> 43:29.234
Opening the first location?

43:29.318 --> 43:32.112
I do. How could I forget?
How could I forget?

43:32.196 --> 43:36.241
Running around, screwing desks together,
trying to connect the Internet.

43:36.742 --> 43:38.994
I remember it was crazy but fun.

43:39.077 --> 43:40.454
Fun, Mikey. Fun.

43:40.537 --> 43:42.706
-I miss it.
-Yeah, I do too.

43:42.789 --> 43:47.085
It didn't feel like work, you know?
Like business.

43:47.836 --> 43:54.259
It felt like this crazy, like,
Red Bull and adrenaline

43:55.177 --> 43:57.596
and laughing your butt off
and getting shit done.

43:58.680 --> 44:03.685
It felt like being a part of something.

44:04.269 --> 44:05.270
I agree.

44:06.772 --> 44:07.940
He's right.

44:11.235 --> 44:13.654
WeWork's not a business. It's a feeling.

44:14.446 --> 44:16.698
We need to give people that feeling.

44:16.782 --> 44:20.327
We're not gonna be able to
do it with charts and graphs and acronyms.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.287
Even the right words
can only get us so far.

44:22.371 --> 44:23.705
We need…

44:24.498 --> 44:25.874
We need images.

44:25.958 --> 44:28.001
-Images. Images.
-Images.

44:28.085 --> 44:29.503
Is that normal for an S-1?

44:29.586 --> 44:31.588
We need to immerse people.

44:31.672 --> 44:35.968
We need to give people that feeling
that we all had that first night.

44:36.051 --> 44:37.803
Wait, were you there that night?

44:38.303 --> 44:40.013
I don't remember you being there.

44:40.597 --> 44:43.559
-It was me, Jacob--
-Of course I was there.

44:43.642 --> 44:46.436
-I've always been here.
-Always.

44:46.520 --> 44:47.521
Thanks for coming.

44:49.064 --> 44:51.400
Thank you, Mikey. Thank you.

44:54.152 --> 44:55.362
Okay, Mikey.

44:56.029 --> 44:57.948
Okay, you're not driving, right?

44:58.615 --> 45:00.075
-No, no.
-Good.

45:02.870 --> 45:05.956
-We were children.
-So great.

45:06.039 --> 45:08.584
Our very first summer camp.

45:09.918 --> 45:12.546
Look at those adoring faces.

45:15.215 --> 45:16.758
They love you.

45:16.842 --> 45:19.636
-No, they love us, us, us.
-I do too.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.471
-The both of us.
-No, no, no.

45:22.389 --> 45:23.390
It's you.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.976
-No.
-They love you.

45:28.312 --> 45:29.521
They resent me.

45:32.482 --> 45:33.942
-They mock me.
-No.

45:34.026 --> 45:37.029
-They talk shit about me behind my back.
-No. No.

45:37.112 --> 45:39.990
They think the school's a vanity project.

45:40.073 --> 45:42.409
They think I can't hear it, but I can.

45:42.492 --> 45:44.328
Even when I don't, I feel it.

45:45.245 --> 45:48.540
Who is "they"? Who is "they"?

45:48.624 --> 45:50.876
Give me names, and they're gone.

45:50.959 --> 45:51.960
Gone.

45:53.253 --> 45:55.214
You can't fire the whole company.

45:55.297 --> 45:57.174
Yes, I can. Watch me.

45:57.257 --> 46:00.385
-I'll drag them out by their--
-It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

46:03.430 --> 46:06.058
I've evolved beyond all of that now.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.727
I finally know…

46:11.271 --> 46:12.481
what I am.

46:14.608 --> 46:17.861
I'm not a maverick,
or a magician, or a muse.

46:17.945 --> 46:20.781
I'm not even Chief Branding Officer.

46:20.864 --> 46:22.115
Not really.

46:24.535 --> 46:31.166
I used to think that it was my job
to safeguard the soul of the company,

46:31.250 --> 46:33.627
but even that's not really true.

46:40.300 --> 46:43.554
I am the soul of the company.

46:51.228 --> 46:52.938
Yes, you are.

46:53.021 --> 46:54.022
You are.

46:54.648 --> 46:57.568
And you are in every atom
of wood and brick and steel

46:57.651 --> 46:59.570
in every WeWork in the world.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.364
We both are.

47:02.447 --> 47:03.448
Yes.

47:05.367 --> 47:09.162
And what we have made
is even bigger than the both of us.

47:18.297 --> 47:19.298
Yes.

47:20.799 --> 47:21.842
Yes?

47:23.760 --> 47:25.220
I have to write.

47:25.804 --> 47:29.516
WeWork is a community company

47:29.600 --> 47:32.352
committed to maximum global impact.

47:33.437 --> 47:37.065
We dedicate this to the energy of we.

47:37.149 --> 47:38.901
Greater than any one of us,

47:38.984 --> 47:41.653
but inside each of us.

47:42.779 --> 47:47.618
We believe our company has the power
to elevate how people work…

47:49.536 --> 47:50.621
live…

47:52.873 --> 47:54.249
and grow.

47:58.670 --> 48:04.968
"The We Company is committed
to being meat-, plastic- and carbon-free."

48:06.136 --> 48:12.226
"Our mission is nothing less than
to elevate the world's consciousness."

48:12.309 --> 48:17.981
We invite you to join us
in creating a better world,

48:18.065 --> 48:21.860
because "we" are just getting started.

48:31.954 --> 48:33.956
What the fuck was that?

48:35.707 --> 48:37.584
I knew he wouldn't get it.

48:39.419 --> 48:42.172
That was our S-1.

48:43.131 --> 48:44.967
But don't worry, Cammy Number Two.

48:45.050 --> 48:47.219
Everything the lawyers wanted is in there.

48:47.302 --> 48:49.513
-We just got rid of old conventions.
-Right.

48:49.596 --> 48:53.559
These pictures… My God.

48:53.642 --> 48:55.435
That introduction--

48:55.519 --> 48:58.480
You've turned the S-1
into a children's book.

48:58.564 --> 48:59.940
-Cam.
-Okay? Bruce.

49:00.023 --> 49:02.442
Have you ever seen an S-1?

49:02.526 --> 49:05.195
Actually, Cam, I worked on Wall Street.

49:05.279 --> 49:07.698
So, yes, I do know what an S-1 is.

49:07.781 --> 49:08.782
Got it.

49:09.366 --> 49:11.076
I have a question for you.

49:11.159 --> 49:13.036
Do you know what a mandarin is?

49:14.121 --> 49:15.873
No? Well, let me tell you.

49:16.498 --> 49:20.294
When I was in China,
opening our Shanghai location,

49:20.794 --> 49:23.672
dealing with inspectors and bureaucrats

49:23.755 --> 49:25.591
and more inspectors and more bureaucrats,

49:25.674 --> 49:28.427
my Chinese friends taught me
the word "mandarin."

49:30.179 --> 49:34.850
A mandarin was a government official

49:35.726 --> 49:39.479
in the imperial system
in 15th-century China.

49:40.063 --> 49:41.481
They thought they were hot shit

49:41.565 --> 49:45.444
because they were chosen
by a rigorous examination process.

49:45.527 --> 49:48.780
The Emperor wanted them to think that,
because in thinking that,

49:48.864 --> 49:51.783
they carried themselves
with great dignity and authority,

49:51.867 --> 49:54.661
and everybody listened
to what they had to say.

49:54.745 --> 50:00.834
But what they had to say was simply
what the Emperor wanted them to say.

50:01.585 --> 50:06.590
They had no real agency or vision…

50:09.218 --> 50:10.260
or power.

50:11.929 --> 50:17.559
So, for all their arrogance and swagger,
they were simply bureaucrats.

50:18.143 --> 50:19.561
Civil servants.

50:20.312 --> 50:21.522
Mouthpieces.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.066
You're a mandarin.

50:26.902 --> 50:27.903
And I…

50:29.404 --> 50:30.822
I'm an emperor.

50:35.577 --> 50:36.828
File it, Bruce.

50:39.081 --> 50:41.500
You're not going to back this, are you?

50:42.668 --> 50:45.754
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it's time for a new approach.

50:46.338 --> 50:48.090
You're going to allow this?

50:48.173 --> 50:50.968
We're going to get fucking pilloried.

50:51.927 --> 50:55.097
They're going to fucking destroy us.

50:57.099 --> 50:58.934
And another thing.

50:59.017 --> 51:00.143
The mandarins

51:01.019 --> 51:02.646
were mostly eunuchs.

51:13.156 --> 51:15.075
-My queen.
-Yes, my king.

51:17.202 --> 51:18.662
-Thank you.
-Of course.

51:20.247 --> 51:21.915
She worked on Wall Street.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.042
For three weeks.

51:44.855 --> 51:46.481
-Here we are, guys.
-Here we are!

51:46.565 --> 51:48.108
Hamptons, here we come.

51:48.775 --> 51:50.444
Dude, this is amazing.

51:50.527 --> 51:52.946
-Only way to get to the Hamptons.
-Hamptons!

52:35.906 --> 52:38.659
For real, man.
How much are you gonna make off this deal?

52:39.159 --> 52:41.537
Worst case, maybe 20, 30 million.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.747
-Twenty, thirty million? What the fuck?
-Yeah.

52:43.830 --> 52:45.874
But if it goes
the way the town expects it to,

52:45.958 --> 52:47.042
it could be 50.

52:47.125 --> 52:50.629
-Shit. Fifty million!
-Yeah, I know!

53:06.979 --> 53:08.480
Dude, you've got to read this.

53:08.564 --> 53:11.066
Galloway just destroyed
WeWork on his blog.

53:11.692 --> 53:13.068
Have you read their S-1 yet?
