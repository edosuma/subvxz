WEBVTT

00:56.482 --> 00:58.000
- Hey, come here.

00:59.103 --> 00:59.931
I got you.

01:11.827 --> 01:12.689
The same one?

01:19.137 --> 01:20.724
You wanna talk about it?

01:32.689 --> 01:33.517
- It just...

01:35.551 --> 01:36.724
It felt so vivid.

01:40.793 --> 01:42.379
Like I could feel it.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.241
I was drowning.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.137
And I think someone was
trying to help me this time.

01:50.172 --> 01:51.793
- Really?

01:51.827 --> 01:56.482
Who was it?

01:58.206 --> 01:59.448
- I don't know.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.448
I couldn't see anything.

02:04.482 --> 02:05.655
There was blood everywhere.

02:08.275 --> 02:09.896
But I could feel him.

02:14.655 --> 02:15.482
- Him?

02:23.827 --> 02:24.896
- I don't know.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.517
- Babe, we're gonna get
through this, all right?

02:31.241 --> 02:32.379
- What if we don't?

02:32.413 --> 02:34.931
- We don't have any choice.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.206
We gotta get through this.

02:49.724 --> 02:53.172
- You're such an optimist.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.206
- With a dash of love.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.517
Of course.

02:56.586 --> 02:57.931
Mm.

02:57.965 --> 02:59.620
Let's get your meds.

03:01.655 --> 03:03.000
- No, I made up my mind.

03:03.034 --> 03:04.931
I'm not going to...

03:04.965 --> 03:06.379
- Going to what?

03:06.413 --> 03:07.241
Take them?

03:08.586 --> 03:11.241
- Will you just hear me out?

03:11.931 --> 03:12.758
Okay?

03:13.724 --> 03:14.551
They...

03:16.965 --> 03:19.620
They make me lethargic.

03:21.517 --> 03:25.448
Like, sometimes I can't even
function or do simple things.

03:25.448 --> 03:27.827
- And that's just because
you're stressed out, all right?

03:27.862 --> 03:29.724
You're working a lot,
between the shop,

03:29.793 --> 03:30.620
with Jada, with me.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.275
And you can't be every
woman all the time, babe.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.655
- Bryce, I made up my mind.

03:45.482 --> 03:48.482
- And that's it? No discussion?

03:48.551 --> 03:51.620
No thought on how
this ended last time

03:51.689 --> 03:52.448
with you going--

03:52.517 --> 03:53.482
- Don't. Don't.

03:54.379 --> 03:55.413
- No.

03:55.413 --> 03:56.931
- Don't go there.

03:56.931 --> 03:58.724
- No, we've already moved in
now and unpacked our shit.

04:00.310 --> 04:01.931
The last tango
around you sneaking

04:01.931 --> 04:04.034
and not taking your
medication resulted

04:04.068 --> 04:05.827
in your agoraphobia
making you believe

04:05.827 --> 04:07.586
you were trapped in your car.

04:07.655 --> 04:08.793
You punched out the window.

04:08.862 --> 04:10.551
That's how you got
the scar on your hand.

04:10.586 --> 04:14.620
You ran for blocks on end,
Faith, until you collapsed.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.793
Is that what you wanna
relive, day in and day out?

04:17.827 --> 04:19.827
That's the experience we
wanna give our daughter?

04:37.689 --> 04:38.517
Babe.

04:40.965 --> 04:43.000
I'm begging you, please.

04:45.068 --> 04:49.482
Take the medication so we
can start our day in peace.

05:10.586 --> 05:12.724
I love you and you know this.

05:14.862 --> 05:16.413
This is what's best.

05:29.517 --> 05:31.724
Jada! It's time for
school, monster!

06:26.862 --> 06:28.000
- Can I join you?

06:55.517 --> 06:56.758
Good morning my loves.

06:57.896 --> 06:59.586
Good morning, princess.

06:59.655 --> 07:00.724
Muah!

07:00.724 --> 07:02.172
- Morning, daddy.

07:02.241 --> 07:04.068
- Morning, darling.

07:08.275 --> 07:11.275
And I believe I already
gave you a good morning.

07:11.275 --> 07:13.000
- Oh, is that so?

07:13.034 --> 07:13.862
- Mm-hm.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.137
- Good morning and welcome
to New Day World News.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.862
Joining me this morning
is presidential candidate

07:22.896 --> 07:26.275
and retired four-star
general, Michelle Dupree.

07:26.344 --> 07:27.586
She is best known--

07:27.655 --> 07:29.103
- Babe.
- Hm?

07:29.172 --> 07:30.586
- For leading a successful
mission into Afghanistan

07:30.620 --> 07:32.551
and the take down
of the OCI regime.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.034
A terrorist organization--

07:34.068 --> 07:34.862
- Babe, did you remember--

07:34.862 --> 07:35.965
- Just give me a second.

07:36.034 --> 07:37.137
- By
overthrowing and killing

07:37.206 --> 07:40.758
then President
Abdur-Raheem Zalmai.

07:40.758 --> 07:42.758
Welcome to New Day,
General Dupree,

07:42.758 --> 07:44.862
and congratulations on
your recent retirement

07:44.931 --> 07:47.551
and of course, your
bid for the presidency.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.793
- Thank you for having me.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.620
That was quite an introduction.

07:51.655 --> 07:53.103
You know, Lydia, one
of the things that I

07:53.103 --> 07:55.931
am most proud of was
being able to assist

07:56.000 --> 07:59.137
the new democratically elected
president of Afghanistan

07:59.137 --> 08:01.034
with taking power.

08:01.034 --> 08:02.896
It's a great addition
to my life's work

08:02.931 --> 08:05.241
to see the Afghani people
receive the liberation

08:05.275 --> 08:07.586
and leadership they
so rightly deserve.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.655
- I was watching that.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.931
- Exactly.

08:11.965 --> 08:15.620
Meanwhile, your husband
and our daughter

08:15.655 --> 08:17.172
have been trying to
get your attention.

08:18.793 --> 08:21.137
Did you remember to make
arrangements for Jada?

08:21.172 --> 08:23.137
You know she has a half
day at school today.

08:24.310 --> 08:26.620
- Oh my god, Bryce, I forgot.

08:26.620 --> 08:27.827
Can you please call in?

08:27.862 --> 08:30.586
- No, we talked about this.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.862
I told you, I have
patients all day today.

08:32.896 --> 08:34.758
Which is why you
agreed this morning

08:34.827 --> 08:36.517
that you would figure it out.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.862
- I know, I meant to.

08:39.862 --> 08:42.172
And I just got distracted.

08:44.379 --> 08:45.689
You know that general on TV?

08:45.758 --> 08:48.896
She looks, like,
really familiar to me.

08:50.241 --> 08:52.068
- That's because
she's always on TV.

08:52.103 --> 08:54.965
And you're a news
hound and that's that.

08:57.206 --> 08:58.000
- Right.

08:59.344 --> 09:01.827
So a half a day, huh, Jada?

09:01.862 --> 09:04.724
Look, mommy has to
work late, okay?

09:04.724 --> 09:07.275
Because there's inventory
coming into the store

09:07.310 --> 09:09.068
and I gotta close.

09:09.103 --> 09:11.000
Karena asked for
the evening off.

09:11.068 --> 09:11.827
- Karena?

09:11.896 --> 09:13.103
- Mm-hm.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.241
- Who's that?

09:14.275 --> 09:15.241
- Yeah, she's my new employee.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.586
She's so good.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.620
- What happened to Melissa?

09:20.655 --> 09:21.862
- Ugh, she was terrible.

09:21.931 --> 09:24.965
Had no customer
service experience.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.689
I mean, she just felt
like she was too good

09:27.724 --> 09:28.689
to touch people's feet.

09:28.724 --> 09:29.793
So I was like, listen girl,

09:29.827 --> 09:31.172
go be a rocket
scientist or something.

09:31.206 --> 09:32.827
Since you wanna act
like you're just

09:32.862 --> 09:34.827
too good to do anything.

09:34.827 --> 09:38.310
- I thought we agreed to
select new employees together.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.172
- We did.

09:40.172 --> 09:42.689
But I needed someone right away.

09:42.724 --> 09:43.896
Karena it is.

09:47.413 --> 09:48.586
It's not a big deal.

09:49.862 --> 09:53.413
Look, how about I text Miss Amy

09:53.448 --> 09:54.965
about picking you up for us?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.931
- Miss Amy to the rescue!

09:57.965 --> 10:00.241
And I'll get to play
with her puppies.

10:00.275 --> 10:01.655
- Mm-hm.

10:03.241 --> 10:04.862
Done.

10:04.931 --> 10:06.068
- Jada gets what she wants.

10:07.379 --> 10:08.724
All the time.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.965
- Eat all your carrots today.

10:12.965 --> 10:13.793
Promise?

10:14.965 --> 10:16.344
Good.

10:16.379 --> 10:17.172
- That's my baby.

10:32.206 --> 10:33.241
- Whew.

11:03.068 --> 11:06.241
- Yeah, I need these.
I'm coming back for you.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.000
Faith.

11:08.758 --> 11:10.068
Guess who has a date?

11:13.448 --> 11:14.275
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you.

11:14.275 --> 11:15.448
You're taking too long.

11:15.482 --> 11:16.379
My grandma.

11:17.827 --> 11:18.448
- What?

11:18.448 --> 11:19.896
- You heard me.

11:19.965 --> 11:21.724
Granny said she
met a man online.

11:21.758 --> 11:24.896
She liked him and they
went on a few dates.

11:24.931 --> 11:27.517
So she gonna live her best life.

11:27.517 --> 11:31.931
So, she can't babysit
my son tomorrow.

11:35.379 --> 11:38.379
- Okay, so Mr.
Steal-Your-Grandmother
is in full effect?

11:38.413 --> 11:40.344
- Pretty much, yeah.

11:40.413 --> 11:42.413
- All right, well, that's okay

11:42.448 --> 11:43.896
because I have a
sitter for Jada tonight

11:43.896 --> 11:45.068
and I did plan on closing.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.965
And I'll just figure some
things out for tomorrow.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.137
- Okay, oof!

11:50.172 --> 11:51.689
I'm getting out of here.

11:51.758 --> 11:53.206
Thank you, Faith, girl.

11:53.275 --> 11:54.379
- Mm-hm!

11:54.448 --> 11:55.310
- Best boss ever.

11:55.344 --> 11:56.172
- Mm-hm!

11:57.517 --> 12:00.000
- Oh shit. Um, and
can you clock me out?

12:02.275 --> 12:03.413
Okay.

12:04.862 --> 12:06.068
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:06.103 --> 12:07.344
I did not even see you.

12:07.344 --> 12:09.068
- It's fine.

12:09.068 --> 12:11.896
I was actually just going
to ask for directions.

12:11.896 --> 12:15.758
My phone died and this
was my navigation.

12:15.793 --> 12:17.103
- Happens to me all the time.

12:17.103 --> 12:20.379
Look, all you do is
exit the parking lot,

12:20.448 --> 12:23.379
make a left, and you'll
see the signs, okay?

12:23.448 --> 12:24.310
- Thank you.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.137
- You're welcome, bye.

12:44.379 --> 12:47.344
- I'll just get right to it.

12:47.344 --> 12:48.413
Dupree can't be trusted.

12:50.413 --> 12:51.931
- You're just figuring that out?

12:53.965 --> 12:56.793
Listen, I know she was
your father's right hand.

12:58.482 --> 13:00.206
He prided himself on maintaining

13:00.275 --> 13:02.275
these powerful connections
and he worked hard

13:02.344 --> 13:04.103
to construct this
impressive empire

13:04.137 --> 13:06.103
of Afghan heroin
but that Dupree...

13:06.137 --> 13:08.241
- Yeah, but since his
death, Dupree's changed.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.103
- Yeah.

13:10.448 --> 13:11.379
- She's quieter.

13:13.241 --> 13:15.379
Gained a lot more power
in a short amount of time.

13:15.413 --> 13:16.931
- Mm.

13:16.965 --> 13:19.344
- It's part of the
reason I relocated.

13:19.413 --> 13:21.517
You know, the main office
from New York to LA.

13:23.586 --> 13:24.172
Dupree's here.

13:26.000 --> 13:26.965
And I've got a feeling
she's setting something up

13:27.000 --> 13:29.379
to take us out, undercut us.

13:33.482 --> 13:34.965
You don't think she's
running for president

13:34.965 --> 13:36.448
for the betterment
of the people do you?

13:55.000 --> 13:55.827
- Oh!

13:55.827 --> 13:57.413
- Bravo, General, Bravo.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.448
- Mr. Secretary.

14:03.206 --> 14:04.344
- You told me every
one of those soldiers

14:04.379 --> 14:06.448
in that unit was dead.

14:06.517 --> 14:10.344
Thomas Richardson, suicide,
shot himself in the head.

14:10.379 --> 14:14.379
Carol Davinson, alcohol
poisoning, drank
herself to death.

14:14.379 --> 14:18.137
Marilyn Roman, electrocuted
in a freak accident.

14:18.206 --> 14:21.034
And Imani Avant drowned.

14:22.965 --> 14:23.896
Allegedly.

14:32.931 --> 14:34.137
- This is impossible.

14:37.551 --> 14:38.965
Uh.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
- Now fix it.

15:24.620 --> 15:25.931
- I need a moment.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.206
- You got it, boss.

15:44.620 --> 15:45.448
- Dominique.

15:47.482 --> 15:49.000
I need to see you.

16:17.068 --> 16:22.137
Come here, baby.

16:22.827 --> 16:24.379
- You called for me?

16:24.413 --> 16:25.551
- Mm, oh, I did.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.551
- I'm here.

16:30.586 --> 16:32.206
- I missed you.

16:32.206 --> 16:33.482
- Missed you, too.

16:50.068 --> 16:51.275
- So I just got a call.

16:52.448 --> 16:53.275
- Okay.

16:57.413 --> 16:59.379
Ah.

16:59.413 --> 17:00.068
- And it contradicts every
fucking thing you told me

17:00.103 --> 17:01.655
about Imani's death, bitch.

17:03.551 --> 17:04.379
Is she alive?

17:05.758 --> 17:06.827
- I promise.

17:06.862 --> 17:08.310
I swear she's dead.

17:09.448 --> 17:10.275
I swear.

17:18.310 --> 17:21.448
You asked me to protect
the family and I did.

17:22.827 --> 17:24.344
At all costs.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.310
Imani betrayed all
of us, remember?

17:30.448 --> 17:32.275
Remember? Remember that?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.620
She had to pay.

17:36.206 --> 17:37.517
This has to be a mistake.

17:45.896 --> 17:50.620
- For your sake, I
hope it is, bitch.

17:51.586 --> 17:52.413
Now get the fuck off me!

17:55.586 --> 17:57.379
Get your shit and get out.

18:21.896 --> 18:22.724
- Hello.

18:23.965 --> 18:26.241
- Scarlet never lost her letter.

18:26.310 --> 18:27.379
- Really?

18:27.448 --> 18:28.275
- Absolutely.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.482
- So, no wet bird?

18:34.517 --> 18:35.758
- I have no fucking idea.

18:37.275 --> 18:38.517
But I need you to go look.

18:39.758 --> 18:40.448
- Where?

18:42.241 --> 18:43.241
- I'll text you the rest.

19:33.827 --> 19:34.827
- Don't move.

19:34.862 --> 19:36.275
- Wait, wait.

19:36.344 --> 19:36.827
Wait, you can have
whatever you want.

19:36.862 --> 19:38.241
- Get down!

19:38.275 --> 19:39.034
- You can have
whatever you want!

19:39.034 --> 19:39.931
I promise you, I don't, ah!

19:40.931 --> 19:41.931
- Stay down!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.896
I told you not to move.

19:51.586 --> 19:54.965
- Keep
'em up, keep 'em up.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.379
- Clear.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.793
- Is that crystal clear?

20:04.931 --> 20:05.931
- Near the front door.

20:05.965 --> 20:06.827
Near the front door.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.620
- Stay right there.

22:05.931 --> 22:07.517
- I should have both
of your fucking heads

22:07.517 --> 22:08.620
right here, right now.

22:14.931 --> 22:17.034
- You look like you
could use a meal.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.689
You want some?

22:18.724 --> 22:20.000
- Your father gave
you one fucking job.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.758
One.

22:21.793 --> 22:23.517
To be a good son.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.689
But you couldn't
even handle that.

22:27.965 --> 22:31.000
I mean my god, Raymond
handed you everything.

22:32.068 --> 22:34.827
Money, his multi-million dollar

22:34.862 --> 22:36.758
liquor distribution business,

22:36.827 --> 22:39.000
his connections, Afghanistan.

22:40.068 --> 22:40.896
Me.

22:44.068 --> 22:47.586
But no matter how much he
loved you and took care of you,

22:47.620 --> 22:49.620
and even though you
were his junior,

22:51.482 --> 22:53.551
there's still one thing
he couldn't teach you.

22:54.965 --> 22:55.586
Loyalty.

23:06.068 --> 23:08.517
Your sister was not only
a better soldier than you,

23:10.482 --> 23:12.172
she was more of a man
than you'll ever be.

23:15.965 --> 23:17.827
So maybe she should
have been left alive.

23:21.965 --> 23:22.965
She is dead, right?

23:29.172 --> 23:31.655
Well, you know what they say.

23:31.655 --> 23:34.620
You want something done
right, do it yourself.

23:36.689 --> 23:38.000
- Well, I guess she's dead then.

23:55.482 --> 23:56.551
- You can play this game.

23:57.931 --> 23:59.827
But you and I both know
who loses in the end.

24:02.517 --> 24:03.137
You'll go down.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.172
And so will your
family's entire legacy.

24:09.172 --> 24:09.758
- Hm.

24:10.758 --> 24:12.172
You know, my father always said,

24:13.758 --> 24:15.724
"Those on the
proximity to power"

24:15.758 --> 24:18.931
"are sometimes deluded into
thinking they wield it."

24:21.137 --> 24:24.586
"But in fact, it's the
man standing behind you"

24:24.620 --> 24:26.896
"that decides if you take
that next step or not."

24:39.310 --> 24:40.965
- Are those his final words?

24:43.137 --> 24:45.827
You were the last one to see
your father alive, right?

24:50.793 --> 24:54.862
Strange how he died
so suddenly like that.

24:57.068 --> 24:57.965
With only you there.

25:16.068 --> 25:16.896
- Ha, ha.

25:18.241 --> 25:20.896
Next time have some class and
order the steak medium rare.

25:27.793 --> 25:29.793
And don't fuck up my fundraiser!

25:52.103 --> 25:53.931
- What the hell is this?

26:14.310 --> 26:16.000
Looks like a robbery gone wrong.

26:17.896 --> 26:18.862
- Gone wrong is right.

26:20.724 --> 26:21.344
This is professional.

26:23.379 --> 26:24.172
- A gang hit?

26:25.827 --> 26:27.172
- From the looks of
this, more than that.

26:28.689 --> 26:29.862
All these bodies are armed.

26:32.965 --> 26:35.000
All I know is that
whatever it is,

26:36.137 --> 26:37.758
it's ruining my weekend plans.

26:40.275 --> 26:40.896
Any witnesses?

26:46.413 --> 26:47.344
- Just one, sir.

27:25.206 --> 27:26.827
- Sir.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.344
I've been here for hours.

27:28.379 --> 27:31.103
An officer still has not
come and taken my report.

27:31.172 --> 27:32.724
Now I know I don't
have to wait this long

27:32.758 --> 27:34.206
to make a report
for my wife missing.

27:34.206 --> 27:36.482
- Well, is she missing
voluntarily or involuntarily?

27:36.551 --> 27:38.758
I mean, I see husbands everyday.

27:38.793 --> 27:40.000
And don't even get me
started on the wives

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
looking for their husbands.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.034
- My wife is missing!

27:44.068 --> 27:45.793
Okay, she could be in danger.

27:45.827 --> 27:47.172
She doesn't have her medication.

27:47.241 --> 27:48.862
Anything could have happened.

27:48.896 --> 27:51.275
She owns a shoe store, she
shut down, did not come home.

27:51.310 --> 27:52.448
- Which shoe store, sir?

27:52.482 --> 27:54.034
- The Gleaming Slipper.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.000
On the strip mall
right off the freeway.

27:58.034 --> 27:58.965
- Wait right here.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.172
Hey.

28:03.379 --> 28:05.275
Call Hoffman.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.000
I think this might
have something to do
with those murders.

28:07.068 --> 28:07.896
- Murders?

28:17.344 --> 28:18.793
- Mr. Dames.

28:18.827 --> 28:19.793
Mr. Avant is in a
meeting right now.

28:19.827 --> 28:20.793
Please, have a seat.

28:23.517 --> 28:25.965
I said, he's in a meeting.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.068
You can't go in there, stop!

28:28.137 --> 28:31.206
Mr. Avant, I
explained to Mr. Dames

28:31.241 --> 28:34.172
that you were in a
meeting and he insisted.

28:34.206 --> 28:35.758
- It's fine, Nola.

28:35.827 --> 28:36.827
- Are you sure?

28:36.862 --> 28:38.241
Because I can call security.

28:38.275 --> 28:39.793
- I am security.

28:39.793 --> 28:40.448
Good day, Nola.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.344
- I promise you,
Nola, it's fine.

28:50.793 --> 28:52.034
Good day, Mr. Dames.

28:53.379 --> 28:54.000
Take a seat.

28:55.517 --> 28:58.482
- What type of fucking
mission are you sending me on?

28:58.517 --> 29:00.413
Are you playing with
me or something?

29:00.482 --> 29:01.068
- What?

29:02.517 --> 29:03.379
I've been waiting
on word from you

29:03.413 --> 29:04.517
since last night and nothing.

29:05.448 --> 29:06.965
So you tell me.

29:07.034 --> 29:08.241
What mission you been on?

29:08.275 --> 29:10.172
- Anytime you've given
me a job, I do it.

29:12.034 --> 29:13.931
I've never given you any
reason to check up on me,

29:13.965 --> 29:15.034
or clean up after me.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.068
And I never needed back up.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.241
- That's why I hired you.

29:19.275 --> 29:22.275
- Yeah, I go to carry out
the job you hired me to do.

29:22.275 --> 29:24.586
And you send a god damn
A-team to the scene before me?

29:26.103 --> 29:26.931
- What?

29:28.034 --> 29:32.896
What the fuck is
he talking about?

29:32.965 --> 29:34.172
- Unless it was you?

29:35.310 --> 29:36.137
- Ha, ha!

29:36.137 --> 29:38.034
You're out of your mind.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.137
Supreme, get your boy, man.

29:42.344 --> 29:44.965
- See, maybe you
nervous, scared,

29:45.931 --> 29:47.034
that I'm getting too close.

29:49.551 --> 29:52.172
Close enough to take your
place and push you out the way.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.551
So you send me into an ambush.

29:55.551 --> 29:56.482
- Two things, boy.

29:58.068 --> 30:01.000
One, you could never
take my fucking place.

30:01.034 --> 30:03.862
And I don't send mother
fuckers to kill, they send me.

30:03.896 --> 30:05.310
So calm your ass
down and leave me out

30:05.344 --> 30:07.413
of whatever bullshit
you really got going on.

30:08.931 --> 30:12.482
- Fellas, this is real cute.

30:12.482 --> 30:13.965
I hate to break this up.

30:13.965 --> 30:16.896
But somebody better tell
me what's going on now.

30:16.965 --> 30:17.482
Talk!

30:17.517 --> 30:18.482
Where's she at?

30:18.517 --> 30:19.344
- She got away.

30:22.344 --> 30:23.275
- Fuck.

30:23.344 --> 30:24.172
- And it definitely was her.

30:25.482 --> 30:26.034
- So what now?

30:27.448 --> 30:28.931
- What you mean, what now?

30:30.206 --> 30:33.068
I'll find her, I'll
execute her, period.

30:36.172 --> 30:38.034
- Yeah, that's
exactly what we'll do.

30:39.241 --> 30:41.931
But first we're gonna
let her come to us.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.827
If there's one thing
I know about Dorothy,

30:45.206 --> 30:46.344
that bitch will always
find her way home.

31:10.448 --> 31:12.931
- It's only me and you, Imani.

32:00.551 --> 32:01.172
- Ah!

32:12.241 --> 32:13.034
Oh shit.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.724
- Mr. Newford.

32:29.793 --> 32:30.655
I'm detective Hoffman.

32:32.586 --> 32:34.344
We'd like to show
you some footage.

32:34.379 --> 32:35.620
- Footage of what?

32:35.689 --> 32:37.344
- An incident that
occurred last night.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.068
Maybe it'll shine some light

32:41.103 --> 32:42.206
on where your wife is.

33:06.310 --> 33:07.241
Is that your wife?

33:09.413 --> 33:10.620
- That's not the wife I know.

33:31.068 --> 33:31.724
- Can I help you?

33:33.517 --> 33:35.620
- Who are you and why
are you in my house?

33:35.655 --> 33:36.448
- Excuse me?

33:38.413 --> 33:40.379
- Where's Bryce and Jada?

33:40.413 --> 33:42.206
- Ma'am, ma'am.

33:42.241 --> 33:43.758
You probably got
the wrong address.

33:43.827 --> 33:45.517
- Are you fucking crazy?

33:45.517 --> 33:46.724
- Ma'am are you okay?

33:46.758 --> 33:48.206
- I live here, where
the fuck is my family?

33:48.241 --> 33:49.137
- Ma'am, hey, hey, hey.

33:49.206 --> 33:50.137
Are you all right?

33:50.206 --> 33:51.137
- Honey, is everything okay?

33:51.206 --> 33:52.206
I heard yelling.

33:52.206 --> 33:53.551
- No, baby, it's all right.

33:53.586 --> 33:54.551
I'm gonna handle this.

33:54.551 --> 33:55.586
- And she's in my fucking robe.

33:55.620 --> 33:56.137
What the fuck is--
- Hey!

33:58.172 --> 33:59.724
- Where the fuck is my family?

33:59.724 --> 34:01.137
- Ah!

34:01.137 --> 34:02.137
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

34:02.137 --> 34:03.206
- I'm on with the police.

34:03.241 --> 34:04.724
- Call them.

34:04.758 --> 34:06.344
This is my fucking house,
they'll figure this shit out.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.137
- Hurry, please, she's
attacking us now.

35:28.482 --> 35:29.724
- Bryce.

35:29.724 --> 35:32.896
- Daddy, daddy! Where's Mommy?

35:32.896 --> 35:34.586
- Hey, baby.

35:34.586 --> 35:36.758
Uh, Mommy's gonna
be home soon, okay?

35:36.793 --> 35:38.620
I promise that.

35:38.655 --> 35:40.448
But guess what?

35:40.482 --> 35:41.724
- What?

35:41.793 --> 35:43.448
- So you know, you
love the lake house.

35:44.551 --> 35:45.827
- Yes.

35:45.827 --> 35:47.482
- Amy's gonna take
you to the lake house

35:47.482 --> 35:50.241
and Mommy and I will
join you soon, all right?

35:50.310 --> 35:51.724
- Yay, the lake!

35:51.758 --> 35:53.931
- We're gonna
have so much fun.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.482
Let's go pack, okay?

35:55.482 --> 35:56.482
- Okay!

37:14.413 --> 37:15.689
- What the fuck?

37:34.724 --> 37:37.517
- You should not
be on this phone.

38:17.034 --> 38:17.862
- Senator.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.827
- I'm not pleased.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.793
Matter of fact, that's
an understatement.

38:31.931 --> 38:32.862
I'm vexed.

38:36.000 --> 38:36.931
I'm quite vexed.

38:40.586 --> 38:43.448
I need to understand how
a veteran CIA officer

38:43.482 --> 38:45.034
allows any of this to happen.

38:48.103 --> 38:50.034
Please, fill me in.

38:51.931 --> 38:54.448
Because the last come to
Jesus moment that we had,

38:54.482 --> 38:57.517
you told me you were weening
her off the medication

38:57.551 --> 38:58.793
and slowly bringing her around.

38:58.793 --> 39:00.586
- Yes, I was bringing
her around but--

39:00.655 --> 39:01.482
- Shh.

39:03.068 --> 39:04.965
I was raised to believe
that anything before

39:04.965 --> 39:06.896
that "but" is bullshit.

39:08.724 --> 39:09.965
So why don't you
do us both a favor

39:10.034 --> 39:13.172
and skip to the part
where somehow, once again,

39:13.241 --> 39:16.172
you led me into a mess that
I have to clean up for you

39:16.241 --> 39:17.793
and your assigned bride.

39:17.827 --> 39:19.000
- If you'll let me
explain, Senator.

39:19.068 --> 39:22.448
- You see, that's
my issue, Alexander.

39:22.482 --> 39:23.689
You're always explaining.

39:25.137 --> 39:28.034
First, you explained
that in order for Avant

39:28.103 --> 39:30.482
to feel that she was
in a normal family,

39:30.517 --> 39:32.482
she needed a child.

39:32.517 --> 39:34.137
So we arranged for
you to adopt one.

39:36.068 --> 39:39.689
Then you explained that she
was bored being a housewife

39:39.724 --> 39:41.758
so we put things
in place for her

39:41.827 --> 39:44.586
to open a fucking business.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.206
All under the guise that you
would be bringing her around

39:48.241 --> 39:51.862
just in time for me to use
the information that I need.

39:51.896 --> 39:53.758
And yet all I've
gotten out of it

39:53.793 --> 39:55.896
is Dupree's poll numbers rising

39:55.931 --> 39:58.172
and her climbing
directly up my ass

39:58.241 --> 39:59.896
in the presidential race.

39:59.896 --> 40:01.137
- My wife, I mean...

40:01.172 --> 40:03.551
- No, you're right.

40:03.620 --> 40:06.448
You were correct. Your wife.

40:07.793 --> 40:09.586
Because clearly,
you've fallen in love.

40:10.862 --> 40:13.655
- With all due respect, Senator,

40:13.689 --> 40:15.965
let's be real here for a moment.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.068
You knew Avant and I
had a thing going on

40:18.137 --> 40:19.931
before any of this.

40:19.931 --> 40:21.931
Which is why you and
the head of your company

40:22.000 --> 40:24.896
elected that I'd be on
top of this assignment.

40:24.931 --> 40:27.000
And the fact that she's
been shot and has amnesia,

40:27.000 --> 40:27.724
that's real.

40:28.862 --> 40:31.000
We've just been prolonging it

40:31.068 --> 40:33.689
so that we can wait it out
until the election year.

40:34.517 --> 40:35.827
And that was your call.

40:35.896 --> 40:37.896
- It was. Why?

40:39.758 --> 40:41.758
Because if she stepped
into total recall

40:41.793 --> 40:43.965
she would confront Dupree

40:44.000 --> 40:46.103
and Dupree would
try to kill her.

40:46.103 --> 40:47.793
Again.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.827
And probably get
away with everything.

40:49.862 --> 40:50.793
- And that
wouldn't have been good

40:50.827 --> 40:52.068
for you running for president.

40:52.068 --> 40:53.551
- Exactly.

40:53.586 --> 40:55.724
- But I've done
everything so far

40:55.793 --> 40:56.965
that you've asked me to do.

40:56.965 --> 40:58.758
- Everything except
keeping bandits

40:58.827 --> 41:01.103
from kidnapping your
asset outside a store.

41:01.137 --> 41:02.724
Other than that,
you're doing great.

41:04.620 --> 41:08.068
Now, this election's gonna
be here before you know it.

41:09.965 --> 41:12.172
And you shoulda brought
her around by now, Doctor.

41:13.862 --> 41:16.517
Especially if you expect
me to nominate you

41:16.551 --> 41:18.689
as the head of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

41:20.137 --> 41:21.620
Unless that's changed?

41:21.655 --> 41:22.827
- Nothing's changed, sir.

41:23.931 --> 41:26.793
At the same time, we
both know the process

41:26.862 --> 41:29.827
of removing this medication
can cause severe hallucinations

41:29.862 --> 41:31.793
and even be deadly.

41:31.862 --> 41:33.724
Which is why the
weening takes time.

41:34.965 --> 41:37.206
- You know what takes time?

41:37.206 --> 41:38.896
You dragging this
out takes time.

41:40.551 --> 41:42.034
You should have let her
just have some seizures

41:42.034 --> 41:44.068
or whatever the fuck it
is and get on with it.

41:45.965 --> 41:48.758
Yet here we are with soldier
gone wild on the loose.

41:48.793 --> 41:50.241
Two dead hit men
in the parking lot

41:50.275 --> 41:52.103
and god only knows
who sent them.

41:52.137 --> 41:55.068
And police evidence that
your wife killed them.

41:56.793 --> 41:58.758
Evidence that we now
have to make disappear.

41:58.793 --> 41:59.551
- I've handled that.

41:59.620 --> 42:01.172
- Oh yeah.

42:01.206 --> 42:04.068
Yeah, let's not forget about
the police report you filed.

42:04.068 --> 42:06.689
- Of course, I've gotta
play the concerned husband.

42:06.689 --> 42:07.827
- Okay, let's cut the bullshit.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.551
You're not fooling any
fucking body with that.

42:12.586 --> 42:14.241
You were concerned.

42:14.275 --> 42:15.655
About your wife.

42:19.793 --> 42:20.620
Now.

42:23.275 --> 42:27.137
You have 72 hours to get
her ass back in place

42:27.137 --> 42:29.793
and resume your assignment.

42:32.896 --> 42:35.000
Or I'm gonna eliminate
the whole operation.

42:37.379 --> 42:40.896
And I do mean the
whole operation.

42:54.310 --> 42:55.827
- Going up.

43:19.103 --> 43:22.275
- If I don't leave,
he's going to kill me.

43:22.310 --> 43:23.620
And you too.

43:24.965 --> 43:26.206
- What happened?

43:26.275 --> 43:30.137
- Listen, I have to
tell you something.

43:30.172 --> 43:30.965
- Anything.

43:33.689 --> 43:35.896
- Supreme was apart of
the original hit on Imani.

43:37.206 --> 43:38.931
He got the orders from
the General but...

43:44.413 --> 43:45.241
- But what?

43:47.689 --> 43:48.275
- I did it.

43:54.206 --> 43:55.758
I was desperate for money,

43:55.793 --> 43:57.103
for my mother's medical expenses

43:57.137 --> 44:00.275
and... I just agreed.

44:02.137 --> 44:04.655
And I swear I thought
Imani was dead.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.896
- Why did they want her dead?

44:07.931 --> 44:10.724
- Something about,
she knew too much

44:10.758 --> 44:12.724
and that she was gonna
be bringing everyone down

44:12.758 --> 44:14.034
with the information she had.

44:15.413 --> 44:18.482
Something went down
in Afghanistan.

44:18.551 --> 44:21.758
And the General returned
on operation wipe out.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.896
The entire troops
were knocked off.

44:23.896 --> 44:24.724
- You?

44:24.724 --> 44:26.413
- Hell no!

44:26.448 --> 44:28.896
One body of blood on my hands
was more than enough for me.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.275
- What's General Dupree's
real ties to Supreme?

44:34.275 --> 44:38.344
- She was his father's
overseas connect, then his.

44:38.379 --> 44:40.793
Now he and Jonathan are
going a different direction

44:40.827 --> 44:42.172
with another connect.

44:42.206 --> 44:43.344
- Who?

44:43.379 --> 44:44.793
- I don't know.

44:44.793 --> 44:45.689
- I need you to find that out.

44:45.724 --> 44:46.724
- Why?

44:48.896 --> 44:51.827
We need to get out
of here like we said.

44:53.206 --> 44:56.000
I have access to
Supreme's accounts

44:56.068 --> 44:58.862
and I've transferred more
than enough money into mine.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.068
He won't miss it.

45:02.551 --> 45:06.965
I've packed my bags and as
soon as I leave here, I'm gone.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.310
And I want you to come with me.

45:11.896 --> 45:15.034
But if you decide
that you wanna stay

45:15.068 --> 45:17.827
and remain loyal to
him, I promise you,

45:17.827 --> 45:19.068
he's gonna take you down too.

45:20.482 --> 45:22.413
Especially since he sent
you to bring her back

45:22.448 --> 45:23.517
and you haven't.

45:23.517 --> 45:24.862
- Shh, shh, shh.

45:26.068 --> 45:26.896
Shh.

45:27.551 --> 45:29.137
Let me worry about that.

46:18.965 --> 46:21.206
- Officer, I'm gonna need
you to uncuff this patient.

46:21.241 --> 46:23.000
- I have orders to keep her
restrained at all times.

46:23.034 --> 46:24.517
- Orders and this
patient's health

46:24.551 --> 46:26.310
are not of the same importance.

46:26.310 --> 46:28.448
Okay, she needs a
CT scan of her head.

46:30.551 --> 46:32.413
Anyhow, when I
return I'd appreciate

46:32.448 --> 46:34.206
my patient being
out of these cuffs.

47:07.517 --> 47:08.931
- Faith Newford's room.

47:08.965 --> 47:09.586
- Uh, 450.

47:12.137 --> 47:12.965
- Okay.

47:17.724 --> 47:22.000
All right, anyone in the room,
get them out, immediately.

47:22.034 --> 47:23.137
Standby until I get there.

47:24.413 --> 47:25.241
I need to handle this.

47:26.586 --> 47:29.000
If she escapes,
bring her back to me.

47:30.068 --> 47:30.896
Alive.

47:46.275 --> 47:47.551
- Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

47:53.586 --> 47:55.241
- Oh, fuck!

47:57.000 --> 47:59.310
- What the fuck is
going on here, Newford?

47:59.344 --> 48:01.586
You can't just run up
in here and bark orders.

48:01.620 --> 48:04.206
Your wife is needed for
questioning and you know why.

48:07.413 --> 48:08.241
- Ah, god.

48:13.413 --> 48:15.344
- Now call off your fucking dogs

48:15.379 --> 48:17.206
and get your ass out
of my investigation.

48:17.275 --> 48:18.172
Or this won't end well.

48:24.206 --> 48:26.000
- Hey, Cap.

48:26.034 --> 48:29.551
I have a detective...
Hoffman here.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.034
He doesn't seem to understand
his position, Captain.

48:35.689 --> 48:36.310
Thank you, sir.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.068
He's clear for sure.

48:42.758 --> 48:45.379
- Shit head.

48:45.413 --> 48:46.241
Captain.

48:48.310 --> 48:49.482
Yeah, but...

48:49.551 --> 48:50.379
Okay.

48:53.586 --> 48:54.379
Fuck!

49:03.310 --> 49:04.068
- Ah!

49:05.413 --> 49:06.241
Oh.

49:08.689 --> 49:09.517
Hey!

49:11.344 --> 49:12.103
- Faith.

49:15.655 --> 49:16.620
Wait.

49:16.655 --> 49:18.034
- God damn it.

50:43.551 --> 50:44.344
- Bryce?

50:45.413 --> 50:46.517
- Target secure.

50:48.275 --> 50:49.241
Faith, baby.

50:51.137 --> 50:52.103
I know you're scared.

50:54.793 --> 50:56.103
But I need you to trust me.

50:58.551 --> 51:00.310
I need you to come with me.

51:00.310 --> 51:01.586
I can explain!

51:48.241 --> 51:49.517
- And then she gonna say,

51:49.586 --> 51:51.482
you must be taking
diet baby aspirin.

51:51.517 --> 51:52.551
Because them blue
pills you takin,

51:52.620 --> 51:54.275
ain't doing shit for you.

51:54.310 --> 51:56.275
I mean, she clean cussed me out.

51:56.275 --> 51:58.344
Said she's looking to
settle down with a stallion.

51:59.344 --> 52:00.517
Ha!

52:00.551 --> 52:03.655
I told her, bitch,
you are 72 years old.

52:03.724 --> 52:05.620
The only stallion you'll
be settling down with

52:05.689 --> 52:06.724
is Jesus Christ.

52:15.379 --> 52:16.517
Yeah, sure did!

52:24.379 --> 52:25.172
Yeah, all right, Momma.

52:25.206 --> 52:26.793
I love you too.

52:26.827 --> 52:27.448
All right.

52:35.379 --> 52:36.517
- Alrighty, here we go!

52:38.655 --> 52:39.482
All right.

52:45.965 --> 52:47.413
Alrighty, Ralph.

52:48.931 --> 52:51.103
Are you ready for
your last ride?

52:54.413 --> 52:55.379
All right, here we go.

52:57.241 --> 52:58.448
Vroom, vroom, vroom!

52:59.793 --> 53:00.758
Ah!

53:02.517 --> 53:06.931
Watch out, going
through the door!

53:06.965 --> 53:07.793
Ah.

53:09.758 --> 53:10.586
Ah.

53:15.965 --> 53:16.724
Here we go.

53:18.379 --> 53:19.206
Look out.

53:54.862 --> 53:55.517
Here we go.

53:56.758 --> 53:57.586
Ah.

54:02.448 --> 54:04.000
- Hold it.

54:04.034 --> 54:05.689
- Oh, shit.

54:05.724 --> 54:06.551
They got me.

54:10.724 --> 54:12.896
Listen, listen.

54:12.931 --> 54:13.724
I can explain.

54:15.586 --> 54:19.724
Now, I've been meaning to
file my taxes since '96.

54:19.724 --> 54:21.620
But after what I seen
y'all do to Ron Isley--

54:21.655 --> 54:23.758
- Sir, please step
away from the vehicle.

54:23.793 --> 54:26.448
- No, I, I can't do that, now.

54:26.482 --> 54:29.827
You see, I know exactly
what this is about.

54:29.862 --> 54:32.586
- Sir, I need you to move
away from the vehicle.

54:34.758 --> 54:35.586
Now.

54:36.931 --> 54:37.689
Thank you.

54:39.310 --> 54:40.724
- Shit.

54:40.758 --> 54:43.482
For 32 years I done
bagged and zipped

54:43.482 --> 54:45.448
and bagged and zipped
and bagged some more.

54:46.793 --> 54:48.620
And nobody ever come
behind me to check my work.

54:48.689 --> 54:50.068
It's that new
supervisor of mine.

54:50.103 --> 54:51.482
I know she sent you.

54:52.517 --> 54:53.724
I'm filing a grievance.

54:53.758 --> 54:54.551
Today.

54:55.586 --> 54:57.379
And poor Ralph.

54:57.379 --> 54:59.862
All he did was drop
dead on Wednesday.

54:59.862 --> 55:01.448
And he can't even rest in peace

55:01.448 --> 55:02.517
without the po-po
running up on him.

55:08.827 --> 55:09.655
Shoot.

55:30.103 --> 55:30.965
- Sorry about the
inconvenience, sir.

55:31.000 --> 55:31.827
Have a good day.

55:33.758 --> 55:35.034
Sir, sorry.

55:36.862 --> 55:37.758
- What... you?

55:39.586 --> 55:40.448
It's a damn shame.

55:44.896 --> 55:45.827
God damn shame.

55:47.965 --> 55:48.793
God damn shit.

55:49.965 --> 55:51.482
I tell ya, Ralph.

55:51.482 --> 55:53.931
A black man can't catch a break.

55:54.758 --> 55:55.551
- Get out.

55:58.172 --> 56:00.724
- I knew that bag was a
little too bulky for Ralph.

56:02.482 --> 56:04.000
Look, don't shoot now.

56:04.034 --> 56:07.103
Because you won't get no
argument and no ID from me.

56:07.137 --> 56:08.517
- I don't wanna hurt you.

56:08.551 --> 56:09.724
- That makes two of us.

56:09.724 --> 56:11.793
- I'll be needing this hearse.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.931
- Lady, you can
have this hearse.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.068
You can have the keys,
Ralph's old stinkin' ass.

56:17.137 --> 56:18.448
All of it.

56:18.517 --> 56:20.448
You ain't getting no
argument from me, lady.

56:20.517 --> 56:21.689
I ain't seen nothing.

56:33.586 --> 56:34.586
Ha.

56:34.620 --> 56:35.655
- Step away slow.

56:36.896 --> 56:37.724
- Okay.

56:38.793 --> 56:40.793
All right, take it easy.

57:30.172 --> 57:31.275
- Faith!

57:31.344 --> 57:33.448
Oh my god, are you okay?

57:35.310 --> 57:37.689
- I don't know what to do.

57:39.862 --> 57:41.931
I don't know what to do.

57:41.965 --> 57:43.068
I'm trying everything.

57:43.103 --> 57:44.241
I'm...

57:44.241 --> 57:45.551
I'm lost.

57:47.103 --> 57:49.103
My world is falling apart
and I don't know who I am.

57:49.137 --> 57:50.103
I don't know what to do.

57:50.137 --> 57:51.517
- Is it Bryce?

57:51.586 --> 57:52.241
Is it Jada?

57:54.689 --> 57:57.103
Why are you in a
hospital gown and a robe?

57:57.137 --> 57:59.241
- I don't know.

57:59.241 --> 58:01.137
I don't know how I got here.

58:01.206 --> 58:02.793
I don't...

58:02.862 --> 58:03.896
- It's okay, it's okay.

58:03.931 --> 58:05.068
Shh. It's okay.

58:05.103 --> 58:06.827
Let's get you
changed and showered

58:06.827 --> 58:08.344
and something to eat, okay?

58:08.344 --> 58:09.241
Then we'll talk.

58:31.068 --> 58:32.827
Tell me what's going on.

58:35.827 --> 58:36.862
Were you in the hospital?

58:38.724 --> 58:39.896
And why do you have a gun?

58:42.793 --> 58:44.275
- Girl, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

58:46.724 --> 58:49.206
My entire life as I
know it has been erased.

58:52.931 --> 58:55.241
I go home and there's
random people in my home.

58:56.827 --> 58:57.931
And my baby is gone.

59:00.172 --> 59:03.000
And then I'm at the
hospital and Bryce shows up

59:03.000 --> 59:04.931
and he's a completely
different person.

59:07.068 --> 59:08.241
He pulled a gun on me.

59:08.275 --> 59:09.862
- What?

59:09.896 --> 59:10.965
What do you mean?

59:11.034 --> 59:13.034
- I've been kidnapped.

59:13.068 --> 59:14.103
- What? By who?

59:14.137 --> 59:16.275
- I've been shot at.

59:16.310 --> 59:18.000
- With bullets?

59:18.068 --> 59:20.000
- I've been called Imani Avant.

59:22.241 --> 59:24.620
- Who?

59:24.655 --> 59:25.931
Who is that?

59:25.931 --> 59:27.965
- I don't know.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.793
I don't know, but
whoever she is,

59:30.827 --> 59:32.137
somebody wants the bitch dead.

59:38.137 --> 59:38.862
- Um...

59:40.724 --> 59:43.655
What floor of the hospital
did you say you were on again?

59:44.862 --> 59:45.827
The locked one?

59:47.931 --> 59:48.896
- I'm not crazy.

59:50.206 --> 59:51.896
- I... I didn't say that.

59:53.275 --> 59:54.000
It's just...

59:57.000 --> 59:58.931
What did you say your
husband did again?

59:58.965 --> 1:00:01.310
What kind of friends
do y'all have?

1:00:01.344 --> 1:00:02.896
- He's a doctor.

1:00:04.965 --> 1:00:06.931
We don't have friends.

1:00:06.931 --> 1:00:07.965
We have a nanny.

1:00:09.379 --> 1:00:10.172
And there's you.

1:00:17.862 --> 1:00:18.655
Look.

1:00:24.896 --> 1:00:26.724
A couple of years ago

1:00:26.758 --> 1:00:28.172
I was in a really
serious car accident.

1:00:30.758 --> 1:00:32.206
I got amnesia from it.

1:00:35.034 --> 1:00:36.413
Bryce has been really good about

1:00:36.448 --> 1:00:38.137
filling me in on the
details of my life.

1:00:43.724 --> 1:00:44.275
- Girl.

1:00:45.931 --> 1:00:48.931
Look, I'm not a cop or nothing

1:00:48.931 --> 1:00:52.931
but I do watch
"Investigation ID."

1:00:52.931 --> 1:00:54.620
And this sounds like
one of those stories

1:00:54.655 --> 1:00:57.068
called A Whole Damn Problem.

1:00:57.103 --> 1:01:01.241
And on the last episode, this
man stole his wife's identity

1:01:01.275 --> 1:01:02.413
and gave it to the mistress.

1:01:02.448 --> 1:01:03.448
- Karena.
- Babe.

1:01:03.482 --> 1:01:04.310
- Karena.

1:01:05.448 --> 1:01:06.310
This is not that.

1:01:11.448 --> 1:01:13.344
- Then why would somebody
call you by another name?

1:01:17.448 --> 1:01:18.068
- I don't know.

1:01:23.862 --> 1:01:26.724
- Well, let's Google
that name and see.

1:01:32.827 --> 1:01:33.413
Imani Avant.

1:01:39.379 --> 1:01:43.068
War hero and
heiress to the Avant

1:01:43.103 --> 1:01:46.241
Liquor Distribution
Company dynasty.

1:01:46.241 --> 1:01:49.724
Dead after
accidentally drowning.

1:01:54.310 --> 1:01:54.931
Faith.

1:01:56.103 --> 1:01:56.931
Is this you?

1:02:04.793 --> 1:02:06.448
- Will you click on that?

1:02:11.586 --> 1:02:14.827
- Captain Imani Avant has
been laid to rest today.

1:02:14.896 --> 1:02:16.241
The war hero and daughter

1:02:16.241 --> 1:02:20.034
of well revered business
man Raymond Avant Senior

1:02:20.103 --> 1:02:22.275
drown tragically after returning

1:02:22.275 --> 1:02:25.000
from a successful
tour in Afghanistan.

1:02:33.137 --> 1:02:37.034
Captain Avant is survived
by her brother Raymond Jr.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.896
As you can see, the
well loved army soldier

1:02:43.896 --> 1:02:47.379
was so highly regarded
that four-star general

1:02:47.379 --> 1:02:52.068
Michelle Dupree and Secretary
of Defense, Arthur Bridges

1:02:53.586 --> 1:02:55.103
were in attendance
at her service.

1:03:00.896 --> 1:03:02.137
- Okay, click on her.

1:03:09.448 --> 1:03:10.275
Zoom in.

1:03:17.379 --> 1:03:18.206
- Yeah.

1:03:19.413 --> 1:03:22.206
I'm so glad you came
up here with me.

1:03:24.275 --> 1:03:26.931
I so needed a moment
away from the city.

1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:30.586
And plus I've been wanting
to get here for awhile.

1:03:30.586 --> 1:03:32.344
- Yeah.

1:03:32.379 --> 1:03:34.103
Honestly, this
place is beautiful.

1:03:37.137 --> 1:03:38.551
You know my brother
really loves you.

1:03:40.517 --> 1:03:43.137
I haven't seen him this
happy since our mother died.

1:03:44.586 --> 1:03:46.344
- I love him too.

1:03:46.379 --> 1:03:49.034
And I would do anything for him.

1:03:57.448 --> 1:03:58.068
- Ha!

1:04:02.965 --> 1:04:03.551
Sorry.

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.482
This wine is really strong.

1:04:09.586 --> 1:04:11.172
The wine is strong.

1:04:14.379 --> 1:04:17.103
Yeah, I thought the wine
overseas was strong, ha!

1:04:18.620 --> 1:04:19.448
This...

1:04:25.965 --> 1:04:26.586
- Cheers.

1:04:38.482 --> 1:04:39.103
- Wait.

1:04:48.206 --> 1:04:49.137
- Um...

1:04:51.034 --> 1:04:52.655
Are you sure you're okay?

1:04:54.689 --> 1:04:56.241
- What's the date
on that article?

1:05:00.034 --> 1:05:02.965
- Uh, the funeral
was only a year ago.

1:05:07.310 --> 1:05:08.965
- Bryce said we've
been married 10 years.

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:09.965
That can't be me.

1:05:15.172 --> 1:05:16.310
Pull up that picture again.

1:05:35.482 --> 1:05:36.275
Fuck.

1:05:41.241 --> 1:05:42.448
- Yeah.

1:05:42.482 --> 1:05:45.275
And that guy, Raymond Jr.

1:05:46.379 --> 1:05:48.000
Better known as Supreme.

1:05:49.413 --> 1:05:50.965
The one that they're
saying is your...

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.344
I mean, her brother.

1:05:55.034 --> 1:05:56.586
He owns the Avant
Suite downtown.

1:05:58.172 --> 1:06:00.517
It's one of those high
end exclusive clubs

1:06:00.551 --> 1:06:02.000
for the rich and famous.

1:06:04.379 --> 1:06:08.413
Politicians, A-listers,
that's who goes there.

1:06:11.827 --> 1:06:13.482
You know, I've heard

1:06:13.517 --> 1:06:16.448
a lot of things about
that Avant family.

1:06:18.551 --> 1:06:21.206
Like, powerful.

1:06:23.551 --> 1:06:25.310
And dangerous things.

1:06:29.068 --> 1:06:30.206
- Dangerous like what?

1:06:33.689 --> 1:06:35.206
Karena, run!

1:06:35.206 --> 1:06:36.103
- Girl.

1:06:36.137 --> 1:06:37.068
- Girl, run!

1:06:37.103 --> 1:06:38.379
- Okay, all right.

1:06:40.551 --> 1:06:41.379
Ah!

1:06:51.137 --> 1:06:52.275
- God damn it!

1:07:34.896 --> 1:07:35.724
- Hey!

1:07:42.379 --> 1:07:43.206
- Ah!

1:07:45.241 --> 1:07:45.827
- Fuck!

1:08:02.551 --> 1:08:03.758
- Faith!

1:08:03.793 --> 1:08:04.620
Get in!

1:08:05.793 --> 1:08:06.724
Get in, girl.

1:08:06.758 --> 1:08:07.586
Come on.

1:08:10.758 --> 1:08:12.379
Girl, close the door, close
the door, close the door.

1:08:14.655 --> 1:08:17.172
People are really
coming after you, faith.

1:08:17.241 --> 1:08:17.931
Why?

1:08:19.931 --> 1:08:20.862
Has this got something
to do with your family?

1:08:20.931 --> 1:08:21.862
- I don't know, Karena.

1:08:21.931 --> 1:08:23.275
- Some mafia type shit?

1:08:23.275 --> 1:08:24.517
- I don't know!

1:08:25.689 --> 1:08:27.310
But I need to find out.

1:08:27.344 --> 1:08:29.413
- Right, because you like some

1:08:29.482 --> 1:08:31.379
wingnut terminator type bitch.

1:08:31.413 --> 1:08:32.931
I mean, you fucked
a handful of men up

1:08:32.931 --> 1:08:34.344
with one karate kick.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.482
How you do that?

1:08:40.931 --> 1:08:41.862
- Good question.

1:08:45.758 --> 1:08:47.448
I need to talk to Bryce.

1:08:47.517 --> 1:08:49.586
- Yeah, call him.

1:08:50.655 --> 1:08:51.551
Right now.

1:08:57.965 --> 1:08:58.793
- Hello?

1:09:01.034 --> 1:09:02.310
Hey, baby, is that you?

1:09:04.827 --> 1:09:05.862
Where are you?

1:09:05.896 --> 1:09:07.379
Come home, please.

1:09:08.275 --> 1:09:10.206
You need your medication.

1:09:12.344 --> 1:09:12.965
- Bryce.

1:09:16.068 --> 1:09:17.551
- Faith.

1:09:19.586 --> 1:09:20.896
- We need to talk.

1:09:30.896 --> 1:09:31.655
- What'd he say?

1:09:33.965 --> 1:09:34.793
- He knows something.

1:09:35.965 --> 1:09:36.793
Take me home.

1:09:51.379 --> 1:09:52.689
- I don't know, Faith.

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:53.517
Are you sure?

1:09:55.379 --> 1:09:57.586
- Whatever is going on, I
can't just leave Jada here.

1:09:59.586 --> 1:10:01.655
We'll figure some shit out.

1:10:01.724 --> 1:10:04.206
- Well, then I'm
coming with you.

1:10:04.275 --> 1:10:07.275
- What I need you to
do is just get your son

1:10:07.310 --> 1:10:09.241
and your grandmother
and go somewhere safe.

1:10:10.931 --> 1:10:11.482
- I will.

1:10:38.931 --> 1:10:41.275
- Let me know if you can
get anymore information.

1:10:53.379 --> 1:10:55.206
- What the fuck is going on?

1:10:55.275 --> 1:10:56.517
- Faith.

1:10:56.551 --> 1:10:58.655
- Why did you have a
gun at the hospital?

1:10:58.655 --> 1:11:00.620
- A gun? I was there
to bring you home.

1:11:03.482 --> 1:11:04.413
- Don't lie to me.

1:11:06.758 --> 1:11:08.655
- Faith, babe.

1:11:10.758 --> 1:11:11.689
Give me the gun.

1:11:13.793 --> 1:11:15.034
All of this is happening

1:11:15.103 --> 1:11:17.793
because you're off
your medications.

1:11:17.827 --> 1:11:20.689
I told you this would happen.

1:11:21.655 --> 1:11:23.689
All right, the panic attacks.

1:11:24.620 --> 1:11:25.793
The violence.

1:11:28.551 --> 1:11:29.517
Feeling trapped.

1:11:36.551 --> 1:11:39.517
I love you, so much.

1:11:40.793 --> 1:11:41.620
Okay?

1:11:44.758 --> 1:11:46.586
And I promise we're gonna
get past this but...

1:11:48.896 --> 1:11:49.724
You've gotta trust me.

1:12:04.724 --> 1:12:07.620
I'm so sorry this
is happening to you.

1:12:20.931 --> 1:12:22.103
Come on, let's go to bed.

1:12:22.137 --> 1:12:22.965
Come on.

1:12:26.827 --> 1:12:27.655
Come on.

1:12:45.551 --> 1:12:47.413
Come on babe, let's go.

1:13:32.862 --> 1:13:33.896
- I'm disappointed
in you, bitch.

1:13:33.896 --> 1:13:35.793
I'm so disappointed in you.

1:13:36.862 --> 1:13:37.965
Uh-huh.

1:13:39.517 --> 1:13:40.137
Stealing?

1:13:42.068 --> 1:13:44.758
Sending a woman to do a man's
job, I can deal with that.

1:13:44.827 --> 1:13:46.517
That's my fault.

1:13:46.517 --> 1:13:48.000
But ain't no bitch
gonna steal from me.

1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:06.413
- Okay.

1:14:12.655 --> 1:14:13.862
- I'm sorry.

1:14:13.896 --> 1:14:14.965
I've never been like this.

1:14:16.137 --> 1:14:16.793
- You only live once.

1:14:30.103 --> 1:14:31.000
- Same one?

1:14:34.103 --> 1:14:34.931
- No.

1:14:38.103 --> 1:14:39.724
This time someone shot me.

1:14:41.068 --> 1:14:45.896
- Really?

1:14:46.827 --> 1:14:51.551
You wanna talk about it?

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:52.827
- No.

1:14:55.551 --> 1:14:57.965
I just want to get
my day started.

1:15:01.103 --> 1:15:03.103
- Babe, listen.

1:15:03.103 --> 1:15:07.344
I know you don't like
taking them pills, but...

1:15:07.379 --> 1:15:08.517
We'll get through this.

1:15:14.172 --> 1:15:15.000
- I know.

1:15:19.586 --> 1:15:20.931
- Now who's the optimist?

1:15:23.586 --> 1:15:24.793
- With a dash of love.

1:15:28.689 --> 1:15:29.896
Jada, monster!

1:15:30.931 --> 1:15:31.965
It's time to get up.

1:15:53.793 --> 1:15:54.551
May I join you?

1:16:08.103 --> 1:16:09.931
I'll take that as a yes.

1:16:15.241 --> 1:16:16.034
- Mm.

1:16:28.137 --> 1:16:29.620
She's back at home now.

1:16:29.689 --> 1:16:31.103
Everything's back to normal.

1:16:31.137 --> 1:16:33.724
I've got eyes on her
everywhere this time.

1:16:33.724 --> 1:16:36.793
In a few days I'll lower the
dosage on her medication.

1:16:36.827 --> 1:16:38.896
We should be able to
find the documents then.

1:16:39.758 --> 1:16:40.586
- Well done.

1:16:43.827 --> 1:16:44.655
Now.

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:48.103
Who sent those men?

1:16:49.448 --> 1:16:50.241
- General Dupree.

1:16:52.448 --> 1:16:54.862
But Dupree's men weren't
the only ones to show up.

1:16:56.793 --> 1:16:57.620
The brother's men.

1:16:59.275 --> 1:17:01.172
- Hm.

1:17:01.172 --> 1:17:02.931
- Raymond Supreme Avant Jr.

1:17:04.896 --> 1:17:06.068
Daddy's little prince.

1:17:07.896 --> 1:17:10.137
Handed life on a
palladium spoon.

1:17:10.172 --> 1:17:12.275
My sources tell me it was Dupree

1:17:12.310 --> 1:17:14.413
who ordered the brother
to execute his sister.

1:17:16.482 --> 1:17:18.827
And that's how she got the
bullet in the back of the head.

1:17:21.310 --> 1:17:21.965
- Wow.

1:17:25.862 --> 1:17:28.344
It appears as though it's
time to return the favor.

1:17:28.379 --> 1:17:29.241
- Absolutely.

1:17:37.103 --> 1:17:39.275
- And yet somehow you're
still sitting here with me.

1:17:48.241 --> 1:17:49.896
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1:17:49.896 --> 1:17:51.862
I appreciate you stopping in.

1:17:51.896 --> 1:17:53.931
I'm still a little bit upset
about my sweet Dominique

1:17:53.965 --> 1:17:55.931
so forgive me if I'm
not myself, all right?

1:17:57.448 --> 1:17:59.379
- Well, I still
can't believe it.

1:17:59.379 --> 1:18:00.275
- Me either.

1:18:02.379 --> 1:18:04.413
I know you loved her,
she was good to you.

1:18:04.448 --> 1:18:06.241
- Too good.

1:18:06.275 --> 1:18:08.931
- I don't want you to
worry about it, okay?

1:18:08.965 --> 1:18:10.344
I've already put some men on it

1:18:10.413 --> 1:18:12.000
and we'll figure
out who did this.

1:18:12.068 --> 1:18:13.724
- Yeah, well my
money's on Dupree.

1:18:18.586 --> 1:18:20.275
That's okay.

1:18:20.310 --> 1:18:21.551
No worries.

1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:24.137
Karma is the master
mother fucker, trust.

1:18:25.034 --> 1:18:26.137
Ha.

1:18:26.172 --> 1:18:27.862
Speaking of Dupree.

1:18:27.896 --> 1:18:30.206
Those men who snatched Imani
before you got there, Khalil.

1:18:30.241 --> 1:18:31.344
- Yeah?

1:18:31.379 --> 1:18:32.827
- Those were the General's men.

1:18:34.862 --> 1:18:37.103
- Are you sure General
Dupree did that?

1:18:37.172 --> 1:18:39.137
- Yeah, that bitch.

1:18:40.517 --> 1:18:41.896
She was actually
the one who gave me

1:18:41.931 --> 1:18:44.551
the intel I gave
you, but obviously

1:18:44.586 --> 1:18:46.724
she ain't trust me enough
to take care of it.

1:18:49.793 --> 1:18:51.000
- She could have got me killed.

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:51.896
- Right.

1:18:53.241 --> 1:18:54.482
That's all right, I got
something for her ass.

1:18:54.551 --> 1:18:55.482
- And what is that?

1:18:57.172 --> 1:18:59.241
- A mark in the cemetery
and a slow walk to hell.

1:19:00.344 --> 1:19:01.827
I just gotta get her there.

1:19:03.103 --> 1:19:05.034
- Well, she does
have the fundraiser

1:19:05.068 --> 1:19:06.103
at the club coming up.

1:19:11.034 --> 1:19:11.862
- Indeed.

1:20:52.413 --> 1:20:53.137
- Oh shit.

1:21:24.137 --> 1:21:24.965
Faith?

1:22:03.448 --> 1:22:05.931
Well, isn't this a
pleasant surprise.

1:22:07.448 --> 1:22:08.275
- Is it?

1:22:13.275 --> 1:22:15.379
Did you forget it's
our anniversary?

1:22:18.310 --> 1:22:19.137
Mm.

1:22:21.275 --> 1:22:22.586
Now who's forgetting?

1:22:27.241 --> 1:22:29.000
- Does it matter now?

1:22:59.689 --> 1:23:01.241
- Slow down, baby.

1:23:02.379 --> 1:23:03.758
Let me do the rest.

1:23:37.724 --> 1:23:38.517
- Faith.

1:23:38.551 --> 1:23:39.379
- Shh.

1:23:42.586 --> 1:23:47.344
Don't say another fucking word.

1:23:50.724 --> 1:23:52.241
Xavier Alexander.

1:23:56.137 --> 1:23:57.241
I wanna know what's going on.

1:23:59.620 --> 1:24:00.482
Don't lie to me.

1:24:02.206 --> 1:24:03.482
Don't try to gaslight me.

1:24:05.137 --> 1:24:06.137
Because I love you.

1:24:08.172 --> 1:24:09.344
But I will fucking kill you.

1:24:12.827 --> 1:24:14.379
I want to know
every single detail.

1:24:18.689 --> 1:24:19.517
- Okay.

1:24:20.689 --> 1:24:21.517
Listen.

1:24:23.517 --> 1:24:25.034
When you got home
from Afghanistan,

1:24:26.241 --> 1:24:27.586
you went to the head

1:24:27.586 --> 1:24:29.206
of the Senate Foreign
Affairs Committee.

1:24:33.172 --> 1:24:36.241
With the promise of returning
with documents and proof.

1:24:38.517 --> 1:24:42.172
- Well, keep up the
good work, Captain.

1:24:42.206 --> 1:24:43.482
- Thank you, sir.

1:24:43.517 --> 1:24:44.344
- Absolutely.

1:24:45.689 --> 1:24:47.862
- Suddenly soldiers

1:24:47.896 --> 1:24:50.206
in your unit were
showing up dead.

1:24:51.827 --> 1:24:53.344
I was put on the case.

1:24:55.931 --> 1:24:58.448
Powell wanted proof of what
went on in Afghanistan.

1:24:59.793 --> 1:25:01.413
I had been assigned
to follow you.

1:25:02.793 --> 1:25:04.620
That night at the
lake, you were there

1:25:04.655 --> 1:25:06.172
with your brother's girlfriend.

1:25:07.655 --> 1:25:10.344
I had to fall back a few
places or blow my cover.

1:25:11.620 --> 1:25:12.827
And I lost you for a moment.

1:25:14.586 --> 1:25:17.517
When I found you,
you were drowning.

1:25:20.862 --> 1:25:22.655
I pulled you out.

1:25:22.655 --> 1:25:24.517
I thought I had
lost you forever.

1:25:26.206 --> 1:25:28.896
Everything that happened after
that was to keep you alive.

1:25:30.310 --> 1:25:31.586
You actually had amnesia.

1:25:32.965 --> 1:25:34.586
But when you started to heal

1:25:34.586 --> 1:25:36.448
and your memories
were flooding back,

1:25:36.482 --> 1:25:37.896
we were in a full operation.

1:25:39.689 --> 1:25:41.620
And I was scared you
would go full metal jacket

1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:43.758
to bring down General
Dupree too soon.

1:25:49.793 --> 1:25:51.379
So I had to create us a life.

1:25:53.379 --> 1:25:54.482
One you would believe.

1:25:56.586 --> 1:25:58.448
Suppress your memories
with medication

1:25:58.517 --> 1:26:00.655
and keep you safe
until the right time.

1:26:19.482 --> 1:26:20.586
- How do I look?

1:26:22.275 --> 1:26:22.689
- You look great.

1:26:28.275 --> 1:26:28.896
A lot better.

1:26:55.344 --> 1:26:57.000
I mean, what did
you want me to do?

1:26:57.034 --> 1:26:58.965
I couldn't just
let them kill you.

1:26:58.965 --> 1:26:59.896
- You killed me.

1:27:01.551 --> 1:27:04.344
Because what the fuck
is a Faith Newford?

1:27:04.413 --> 1:27:05.586
I am Imani Avant.

1:27:07.896 --> 1:27:09.758
What the fuck is
that besides murder?

1:27:13.551 --> 1:27:16.517
And then your dumb ass
couldn't even be creative.

1:27:17.827 --> 1:27:19.724
You named me the
same god damn thing.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000
Did you not know that Faith
and Imani mean the same thing?

1:27:26.034 --> 1:27:27.758
- Of course.

1:27:27.827 --> 1:27:28.758
It's symbolic.

1:27:30.413 --> 1:27:31.344
That's why I picked it.

1:27:35.344 --> 1:27:35.965
Imani.

1:27:39.517 --> 1:27:40.586
You are back now.

1:27:43.482 --> 1:27:44.896
And you know what that means.

1:28:14.413 --> 1:28:15.586
- You make the call?

1:28:15.586 --> 1:28:16.551
- Did exactly as you instructed.

1:28:17.655 --> 1:28:18.965
As soon as she hits her mark,

1:28:20.172 --> 1:28:20.965
it'll be in place.

1:28:22.689 --> 1:28:25.379
- Taking out a
presidential candidate.

1:28:25.413 --> 1:28:26.620
You're a bold mother fucker.

1:28:28.137 --> 1:28:29.517
- I was raised that way.

1:28:33.448 --> 1:28:34.413
- Excuse me, fellas.

1:28:45.068 --> 1:28:46.103
- Got it.

1:28:46.137 --> 1:28:47.793
Everything's a go.

1:28:47.862 --> 1:28:49.689
- Catch her ass right there.

1:28:58.517 --> 1:29:00.551
- Everything okay, Khalil?

1:29:03.034 --> 1:29:03.655
- Mm-hm.

1:29:16.172 --> 1:29:17.551
- You all right, Jabril?

1:29:19.586 --> 1:29:21.137
- Yes sir, I think
we're being followed.

1:29:31.206 --> 1:29:32.103
Coming up on the left.

1:29:41.586 --> 1:29:43.586
- Oh, I think we're okay.

1:29:43.620 --> 1:29:45.551
Think you're just being
a little paranoid.

1:29:45.586 --> 1:29:46.758
- Yeah, I think we're clear.

1:29:48.068 --> 1:29:49.620
- You may be right.

1:29:50.862 --> 1:29:51.793
- Yeah, I'll tell
you what, though.

1:29:51.862 --> 1:29:53.379
These poll numbers are going up.

1:29:54.517 --> 1:29:56.068
I like to see that.

1:29:56.103 --> 1:29:56.827
- Yes, sir.

1:30:04.241 --> 1:30:06.620
- Okay, now what the
hell is this now?

1:30:06.655 --> 1:30:07.931
- Just construction, sir.

1:30:07.931 --> 1:30:09.827
We're just gonna
take this detour.

1:30:09.862 --> 1:30:11.689
It's probably gonna
make us late, though.

1:30:13.827 --> 1:30:15.137
- Ah, it's probably
better, anyway.

1:30:16.517 --> 1:30:18.689
Let her get there first.

1:30:18.724 --> 1:30:20.448
I'm gonna steal some of her
thunder when I get there.

1:30:20.448 --> 1:30:21.103
- Ha!

1:30:29.517 --> 1:30:30.827
- Yo, what the fuck?

1:30:30.896 --> 1:30:31.586
Jabril, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:32.862
- Yo, somebody's following us!

1:30:35.068 --> 1:30:36.068
- Well, go!

1:30:36.103 --> 1:30:37.034
Go, go, go!

1:30:37.068 --> 1:30:38.068
- Just hang on, I got this.

1:30:41.068 --> 1:30:42.758
Oh shit.

1:30:42.793 --> 1:30:44.896
- Who the fuck is this,
Jabril, who is this?

1:30:44.896 --> 1:30:45.827
- I don't know!

1:30:45.896 --> 1:30:47.034
- Shit, he's getting close, man.

1:30:47.103 --> 1:30:48.206
Come on, come on.
You gotta step on it!

1:30:48.206 --> 1:30:49.103
- Shit, here we go.

1:30:54.862 --> 1:30:56.103
- Right. Right,
right, right, right!

1:30:58.965 --> 1:31:02.034
Go around.

1:31:02.068 --> 1:31:04.103
Who the fuck is this?

1:31:06.896 --> 1:31:09.275
Go in the tunnel. Go
in the tunnel, go!

1:31:09.310 --> 1:31:11.551
Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel!

1:31:11.586 --> 1:31:12.344
- Ah.

1:31:12.379 --> 1:31:13.689
Just hang on, I got this.

1:31:18.931 --> 1:31:20.724
- This is fucking Dupree.

1:31:22.689 --> 1:31:24.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:31:26.034 --> 1:31:27.896
What the fuck?

1:31:27.931 --> 1:31:32.206
Go back, go back, go
back, go back, go back!

1:31:32.241 --> 1:31:34.000
Ah!

1:31:38.137 --> 1:31:38.965
Yo.

1:31:40.551 --> 1:31:41.551
- Stay in the car, we got this.

1:31:41.586 --> 1:31:42.689
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:31:42.724 --> 1:31:43.862
- Yo, let's go.

1:31:43.862 --> 1:31:44.758
Stay here, we got this.
- Don't move!

1:31:44.793 --> 1:31:46.000
- No, wait.

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:47.068
No, no, wait, wait,
wait! Hold it.

1:31:48.586 --> 1:31:49.931
- Stay in the car!

1:32:04.068 --> 1:32:06.724
- Come on, come on.
Put the gun down.

1:32:06.758 --> 1:32:08.896
What are you gonna
do, shoot a senator?

1:32:08.931 --> 1:32:10.275
Doubtful.

1:32:10.310 --> 1:32:12.137
Just take me to whoever
fucking sent you.

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.862
- We're honored to host
you, Madam General.

1:32:40.862 --> 1:32:42.655
- It is an honor to
be here, Jonathan.

1:32:47.379 --> 1:32:49.724
- General
Dupree, General Dupree!

1:32:49.724 --> 1:32:52.172
- Thank you, thank
you all for coming.

1:32:52.241 --> 1:32:55.034
Remember, spread the word. Vote.

1:32:57.724 --> 1:32:58.551
- Madam General.

1:33:00.172 --> 1:33:01.344
- Thank you, Jonathan.

1:33:01.379 --> 1:33:02.172
- You're welcome.

1:33:03.758 --> 1:33:07.000
- General
Dupree! One more photo!

1:33:38.827 --> 1:33:41.310
- There he is.

1:33:41.310 --> 1:33:42.275
Ha, ha, ha!

1:33:42.344 --> 1:33:43.758
- Congratulations.

1:33:43.793 --> 1:33:45.758
- Thank you, it is
so good to see you.

1:33:45.827 --> 1:33:47.000
How have you been?

1:33:47.034 --> 1:33:48.206
- I've been great.
I've been great.

1:33:48.241 --> 1:33:49.862
- Yes, I hear you've
been traveling.

1:33:49.862 --> 1:33:51.137
- Yes, but you know, I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

1:33:51.206 --> 1:33:52.862
I have to come out
and support anything

1:33:52.896 --> 1:33:54.068
and everything you do.

1:33:54.103 --> 1:33:55.793
- Thank you, thank you.

1:33:55.827 --> 1:33:57.137
It means the world
to me, you know that.

1:33:57.206 --> 1:33:58.206
- Yes, yes.

1:33:58.241 --> 1:33:59.344
I believe you're gonna win.

1:33:59.344 --> 1:34:00.379
- I do too.

1:34:03.827 --> 1:34:05.000
- You're
gonna take it all the way.

1:34:13.827 --> 1:34:15.344
- Thank you. Hello, everyone.

1:34:15.379 --> 1:34:16.793
- Congratulations.

1:34:16.827 --> 1:34:17.724
- Thank you, what
a beautiful table.

1:34:17.758 --> 1:34:19.068
- Anything you need, we're here.

1:34:19.103 --> 1:34:21.862
- Thank you, that's
so good to know.

1:35:29.379 --> 1:35:31.068
- No place like home, huh, sis?

1:35:34.379 --> 1:35:36.413
You look good.

1:35:36.448 --> 1:35:38.827
For somebody who's seen the
light twice, how was it?

1:35:41.827 --> 1:35:42.793
- You tried to kill me.

1:35:44.310 --> 1:35:45.137
- No.

1:35:47.827 --> 1:35:49.103
I sent somebody else to do it.

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.965
And because I thought you'd
be dead and stay there,

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.413
I didn't think you'd
get mad about it.

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:00.896
- How could you?

1:36:02.241 --> 1:36:04.310
Put a hit out on
your own sister?

1:36:05.344 --> 1:36:06.206
- Please.

1:36:06.275 --> 1:36:07.965
Come on, now.

1:36:07.965 --> 1:36:10.379
We have never celebrated
or been attached to that.

1:36:11.275 --> 1:36:13.103
That sibling thing.

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.241
You know?

1:36:15.310 --> 1:36:16.655
We just arrived here at
the same fucked up time

1:36:16.655 --> 1:36:18.482
by way of the same
fucked up people.

1:36:18.482 --> 1:36:20.310
You know it and I know it.

1:36:20.344 --> 1:36:21.172
So spare me.

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.172
- Mm.

1:36:24.172 --> 1:36:26.172
You really are
the devil himself.

1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:35.862
Did you kill Daddy?

1:36:38.965 --> 1:36:40.413
He had cancer but
it wasn't terminal.

1:36:43.241 --> 1:36:45.862
- You were off to the Army.

1:36:45.931 --> 1:36:48.000
Trying to save the world.

1:36:49.275 --> 1:36:50.241
You don't know that.

1:36:51.137 --> 1:36:54.241
- I know when I came
back our dad's body was

1:36:54.241 --> 1:36:55.965
reduced to a bag of ashes.

1:36:57.137 --> 1:36:59.137
- That's because our
father didn't want

1:36:59.137 --> 1:37:01.206
people looking down
on him in a casket.

1:37:02.275 --> 1:37:04.310
So me, being the oldest,

1:37:04.344 --> 1:37:06.241
and the only one who
was here with him,

1:37:06.275 --> 1:37:07.344
I followed instructions.

1:37:07.413 --> 1:37:08.379
- You didn't follow shit.

1:37:10.344 --> 1:37:11.620
You never followed anything.

1:37:11.655 --> 1:37:13.586
You expect me to believe that.

1:37:13.586 --> 1:37:14.448
You hated him.

1:37:14.448 --> 1:37:16.103
- Ah, don't deflect.

1:37:18.172 --> 1:37:19.344
I hated you.

1:37:19.379 --> 1:37:21.137
- Oh, because you
were jealous of me?

1:37:22.206 --> 1:37:23.103
Right?

1:37:25.241 --> 1:37:27.413
Because I was more like
Daddy than you would ever be?

1:37:30.344 --> 1:37:32.310
You know what Daddy
and I had in common?

1:37:34.310 --> 1:37:35.068
Honor.

1:37:36.241 --> 1:37:37.172
Loyalty.

1:37:38.241 --> 1:37:39.275
Respect.

1:37:41.586 --> 1:37:43.931
You're just a narcissist
who wanted everything.

1:37:45.137 --> 1:37:46.344
And no matter what Daddy did,

1:37:46.413 --> 1:37:48.965
it was never good
enough for you.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:50.137
And you know why that is?

1:37:52.379 --> 1:37:55.517
Because you're just some
little weak ass boy still.

1:37:57.655 --> 1:37:58.586
And we both know that.

1:38:06.344 --> 1:38:07.172
- Cute.

1:38:08.241 --> 1:38:09.413
He ain't never give me shit.

1:38:11.655 --> 1:38:12.482
It was you.

1:38:14.724 --> 1:38:17.310
You were his prized possession.

1:38:20.482 --> 1:38:22.344
- Is that why you put
a bullet in his head?

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:24.620
- Maybe.

1:38:26.551 --> 1:38:27.206
- Maybe.

1:38:29.482 --> 1:38:31.000
I might put a bullet in yours.

1:38:32.137 --> 1:38:32.965
- Ha.

1:38:36.206 --> 1:38:37.000
Go for it.

1:38:44.413 --> 1:38:45.551
- Fucking bitch!

1:39:26.448 --> 1:39:27.793
- Yeah, huh?

1:39:27.793 --> 1:39:30.275
Where your fucking daddy
at now, mother fucker?

1:39:54.758 --> 1:39:56.448
You ain't got the fucking heart.

1:40:24.862 --> 1:40:25.586
- And I believe your father's
in the military, yes?

1:40:25.655 --> 1:40:26.655
- Yes, yes.

1:40:26.689 --> 1:40:28.034
A two-star general.

1:40:28.068 --> 1:40:29.275
- Meh, I got a
couple stars on him,

1:40:29.344 --> 1:40:30.758
but I won't hold
that against him.

1:40:34.551 --> 1:40:35.379
- Get her out of here!

1:40:35.413 --> 1:40:36.689
Get her out of here!

1:40:36.689 --> 1:40:38.206
- Let's go, move, move.

1:40:38.241 --> 1:40:39.000
- Move.

1:41:42.758 --> 1:41:44.241
- Well, well, well.

1:41:45.758 --> 1:41:47.655
I must admit, it's
good to see you.

1:41:50.172 --> 1:41:52.206
You always were a
persistent little thing.

1:41:55.620 --> 1:41:57.448
Surely, you didn't
come to kill me.

1:41:58.827 --> 1:42:00.137
Did you, soldier?

1:42:04.379 --> 1:42:06.172
Always was your
biggest downfall.

1:42:07.310 --> 1:42:08.620
Trying to outshine the master.

1:42:10.482 --> 1:42:12.137
Didn't Raymond
teach you anything?

1:42:13.344 --> 1:42:14.827
- This isn't about my father.

1:42:17.275 --> 1:42:18.551
This is about me and you.

1:42:23.758 --> 1:42:24.862
- Salam Alaikum.

1:42:24.931 --> 1:42:26.275
- Alaikum salam.

1:42:54.275 --> 1:42:55.586
- Balcony, do you see him?

1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:56.413
- I see him.

1:42:59.275 --> 1:43:01.310
- Hey Cap, we got a lot
of movement up there.

1:43:02.379 --> 1:43:04.310
We need to move, now.

1:43:06.482 --> 1:43:07.482
- We're on the move.

1:43:11.758 --> 1:43:13.448
- I got a phone, 12 o'clock.

1:43:16.862 --> 1:43:18.586
I don't like this.

1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:20.724
- We need to
get the President out now.

1:43:20.724 --> 1:43:21.896
- I think we should--

1:43:36.827 --> 1:43:37.724
- We gotta move!

1:43:39.275 --> 1:43:40.241
Move!

1:44:05.896 --> 1:44:07.758
- Cap, wait.

1:44:07.827 --> 1:44:08.586
Maybe you should--

1:44:08.655 --> 1:44:09.793
- I shouldn't what?

1:44:09.862 --> 1:44:11.517
I shouldn't say
anything to the General

1:44:11.517 --> 1:44:13.655
about how she sent us on a
fucking suicide mission, huh?

1:44:15.034 --> 1:44:15.862
Move, soldier.

1:44:31.482 --> 1:44:32.448
- Mission accomplished?

1:44:32.482 --> 1:44:34.034
- What mission, General Dupree?

1:44:34.103 --> 1:44:35.586
The real one or the fake one?

1:44:49.068 --> 1:44:51.344
That was a drone hit.

1:44:51.379 --> 1:44:53.068
Not suicide bombers, not rebels.

1:44:53.103 --> 1:44:54.517
- Be easy, soldier.

1:44:54.517 --> 1:44:55.620
- I lost three men out there.

1:44:55.689 --> 1:44:57.413
- Stand down,
soldier, last warning.

1:44:57.448 --> 1:44:58.310
- That was a fucking ambush!

1:44:58.379 --> 1:45:00.379
- Everything went as planned.

1:45:00.379 --> 1:45:01.862
- Not the plan relayed to me.

1:45:03.827 --> 1:45:07.862
We were supposed to save
President Zalmai, not kill him.

1:45:07.896 --> 1:45:11.482
And then blame it on some
makeshift, OCI rebels

1:45:11.482 --> 1:45:14.724
who were armed with American
weapons and ammunition

1:45:14.758 --> 1:45:16.931
and then conveniently
named terrorists by you.

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:18.379
- Now you're in violation.

1:45:18.413 --> 1:45:19.689
I said, stand the fuck down!

1:45:19.689 --> 1:45:22.000
- Oh yeah, well tell
it to fucking Congress.

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.586
Because I already
alerted the head

1:45:23.620 --> 1:45:25.068
of Foreign Affairs
Committee, Senator Powell,

1:45:25.103 --> 1:45:26.965
that this mission
was faulty by design.

1:45:43.586 --> 1:45:44.586
- We have a problem.

1:45:49.689 --> 1:45:51.724
You know, you always
were too self righteous

1:45:51.793 --> 1:45:52.793
for your own good.

1:45:54.172 --> 1:45:56.793
Nobody gives a fuck
about those people.

1:45:56.793 --> 1:45:58.827
The world has painted
them as terrorists

1:45:58.827 --> 1:46:01.724
and just maybe
that's what they are.

1:46:03.655 --> 1:46:05.689
Do you think anyone
cared that we were

1:46:05.724 --> 1:46:08.482
the ones who actually ordered
the hit on their president?

1:46:09.758 --> 1:46:10.758
That would be a hell no.

1:46:10.793 --> 1:46:11.931
And you know why?

1:46:13.827 --> 1:46:15.482
Because the world
has relegated them

1:46:15.517 --> 1:46:17.034
to being throw away people.

1:46:18.172 --> 1:46:19.965
Not even worthy of the land

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.379
and the rich resources
they sit upon.

1:46:23.896 --> 1:46:25.827
Every time somebody
fills their gas tank

1:46:25.827 --> 1:46:28.000
or heats their
house or buys oil,

1:46:28.034 --> 1:46:29.448
do you think they give a damn

1:46:29.482 --> 1:46:32.137
that we were the ones
who ran over villages

1:46:32.172 --> 1:46:35.413
and started wars and created
faux rescue missions to get it?

1:46:37.034 --> 1:46:38.689
Again, that would be a no.

1:46:38.758 --> 1:46:42.586
And that is because those
people don't matter, Imani.

1:46:42.620 --> 1:46:44.241
And for the life of
me, I can't understand

1:46:44.241 --> 1:46:45.551
why the fuck you think they do.

1:46:45.586 --> 1:46:46.655
- They're people.

1:46:48.655 --> 1:46:49.827
They deserve to live.

1:46:50.965 --> 1:46:51.931
And live well.

1:46:53.758 --> 1:46:55.137
Liberation and democracy.

1:46:56.517 --> 1:46:57.689
That was your mantra.

1:46:59.862 --> 1:47:00.758
Or...

1:47:02.241 --> 1:47:04.275
Does that not matter
to you when it comes

1:47:04.310 --> 1:47:05.482
to black and brown babies?

1:47:05.551 --> 1:47:07.931
- Oh god, here we go.

1:47:07.965 --> 1:47:09.172
The race card.

1:47:09.241 --> 1:47:10.620
I don't make up the
rules, princess,

1:47:10.655 --> 1:47:11.862
I just enforce them.

1:47:13.620 --> 1:47:15.275
And you.

1:47:15.275 --> 1:47:17.586
You've gotta be the biggest
hypocrite of them all.

1:47:19.310 --> 1:47:21.000
I know you don't think
the Avant's wealth

1:47:21.034 --> 1:47:22.793
just came from your
daddy's good looks.

1:47:26.655 --> 1:47:27.931
How many women
and children died?

1:47:29.551 --> 1:47:30.862
How many rebels
were paid to guard

1:47:30.896 --> 1:47:33.724
your daddy's coca and
poppy plantations, huh?

1:47:35.344 --> 1:47:37.034
How many villages
pillaged so you could be

1:47:37.068 --> 1:47:38.206
amongst the 1%?

1:47:39.689 --> 1:47:42.034
Going to your fancy schools.

1:47:42.034 --> 1:47:44.034
Living in your mansions.

1:47:44.034 --> 1:47:45.758
- Don't try to blame
this on my father

1:47:45.793 --> 1:47:48.206
because we both know you were
his partner in all of this.

1:47:49.551 --> 1:47:50.137
- Yes!

1:47:51.275 --> 1:47:53.482
Yes, I was!

1:47:54.310 --> 1:47:55.586
And you wanna know why?

1:47:57.103 --> 1:47:59.000
Because we understood
each other.

1:48:00.620 --> 1:48:02.103
We understood the assignment.

1:48:03.724 --> 1:48:07.310
But you, little miss ungrateful.

1:48:07.379 --> 1:48:09.793
So determined to destroy
everything we built

1:48:09.827 --> 1:48:11.172
and take your own family
down in the process.

1:48:11.172 --> 1:48:12.034
And for what?

1:48:13.137 --> 1:48:14.068
The good of man?

1:48:15.965 --> 1:48:17.586
Oh please, that is such
a pile of bullshit.

1:48:17.620 --> 1:48:18.965
- You should rot in hell.

1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.793
- And you should watch
your fucking back.

1:48:22.103 --> 1:48:23.931
Because your borrowed
time is ticking.

1:48:26.241 --> 1:48:28.965
Now move, soldier.

1:48:53.137 --> 1:48:57.896
- Freeze!

1:48:58.724 --> 1:48:58.965
- Mother fucker.

1:49:10.344 --> 1:49:11.206
- I'm okay.

1:49:11.206 --> 1:49:12.000
I promise.

1:49:23.241 --> 1:49:24.034
- Commander.

1:49:25.344 --> 1:49:26.931
- Sergeant Myles Brailey.

1:49:30.758 --> 1:49:31.931
- Look at you.

1:49:32.862 --> 1:49:34.655
Okay, this is different.

1:49:35.689 --> 1:49:36.793
- You like it?

1:49:36.827 --> 1:49:38.172
- So is this your new uniform?

1:49:38.206 --> 1:49:38.965
- I guess so.

1:49:40.137 --> 1:49:41.586
Ha, good to see you.

1:49:41.655 --> 1:49:42.241
- Good to see you, too.

1:49:45.344 --> 1:49:48.000
Looks like it's time to get
that tatted back on, hm?

1:49:49.103 --> 1:49:50.000
- Sergeant Brailey.

1:49:51.758 --> 1:49:54.862
Or should I say, Khalil Dames?

1:49:56.206 --> 1:49:58.862
My brother, thank you.

1:49:58.931 --> 1:50:00.724
We couldn't have got
this done without you.

1:50:03.068 --> 1:50:04.034
And now that you're back,

1:50:06.172 --> 1:50:08.344
we need to figure out
where these documents are.

1:50:10.172 --> 1:50:14.586
- Well, it looks like you
don't have to search very far.

1:50:15.965 --> 1:50:17.310
The documents are
in the pendant.

1:50:25.034 --> 1:50:26.275
- The whole time?

1:50:26.344 --> 1:50:27.862
- The whole time.

1:50:27.896 --> 1:50:29.655
- The documents
are in the pendant.

1:50:29.655 --> 1:50:31.965
- It's in the pendant.

1:50:31.965 --> 1:50:33.724
- You know what we went through?

1:50:33.758 --> 1:50:34.862
- We could have died.

1:51:10.758 --> 1:51:12.827
- Dupree, Dupree, Dupree.

1:51:16.965 --> 1:51:19.379
I usually don't
come to such events.

1:51:19.448 --> 1:51:22.689
But for you, I decided
to make an exception.

1:51:25.137 --> 1:51:27.689
I had such high hopes for us.

1:51:27.724 --> 1:51:29.379
You were so smart.

1:51:29.413 --> 1:51:31.827
And you were definitely on
your way to being president.

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:36.034
But you allowed
your own ambitions

1:51:36.068 --> 1:51:38.034
to get ahead of what I
instructed you to do.

1:51:39.241 --> 1:51:41.965
And now, you know
how this works.

1:51:43.379 --> 1:51:47.172
Don't worry, I made all
the proper arrangements.

1:51:47.241 --> 1:51:50.965
And this will be easy and quiet.

1:52:08.344 --> 1:52:09.758
Cyanide gas.

1:52:11.413 --> 1:52:12.206
It'll be quick.

1:52:14.551 --> 1:52:16.724
Painful, but quick.

1:52:18.482 --> 1:52:21.965
You'll feel dizzy,
the room will spin.

1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:23.068
You'll begin to seize.

1:52:24.448 --> 1:52:25.931
Your heart will race.

1:52:25.965 --> 1:52:27.482
Your blood pressure will spike.

1:52:29.551 --> 1:52:32.103
And then it'll all be over.

1:53:16.620 --> 1:53:17.413
Clean this up.

1:53:34.862 --> 1:53:37.137
- Officers Avant,
Brailey, Alexander.

1:53:38.172 --> 1:53:39.103
Job well done.

1:53:40.517 --> 1:53:42.827
This is what happens when
agencies work together.

1:53:42.862 --> 1:53:44.896
The CIA and Army spec ops,

1:53:44.931 --> 1:53:46.827
we're all brothers and
sisters when we're out there.

1:53:46.862 --> 1:53:49.000
Congratulations.

1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.034
Let's not forget
your field team.

1:53:51.068 --> 1:53:52.241
They worked fast and diligently

1:53:52.275 --> 1:53:54.137
when things started to go south.

1:53:54.206 --> 1:53:55.206
Thank you for your service.

1:53:56.586 --> 1:53:58.034
By now you've all heard
that General Dupree

1:53:58.068 --> 1:53:59.862
has committed suicide.

1:53:59.931 --> 1:54:02.344
Not surprising, she took
the coward's way out.

1:54:02.379 --> 1:54:04.482
And while she'll never
face a court of law

1:54:04.482 --> 1:54:08.275
or jury of her peers, I've
received classified intel

1:54:08.275 --> 1:54:09.931
that she orchestrated
the killing

1:54:09.965 --> 1:54:13.000
of President Zalmai to extend
the war in Afghanistan.

1:54:13.034 --> 1:54:13.862
- Why?

1:54:15.206 --> 1:54:15.896
- She was involved
in a operation

1:54:15.931 --> 1:54:17.413
that was allowing tons of heroin

1:54:17.448 --> 1:54:20.206
into our country via
our nation's ports.

1:54:20.206 --> 1:54:21.586
And she was colluding
with the rebels

1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:24.172
of South and West Africa
to build a drug empire.

1:54:25.241 --> 1:54:27.068
When our new
president is elected,

1:54:27.103 --> 1:54:28.344
I'll work with
that administration

1:54:28.413 --> 1:54:30.620
to have the op declassified.

1:54:30.655 --> 1:54:33.206
So Dupree will be disgraced
and go down in history

1:54:33.275 --> 1:54:35.482
as a war criminal,
a drug dealer,

1:54:35.517 --> 1:54:37.965
and a traitor to
the United States.

1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:39.448
And all of you
will be recognized

1:54:39.448 --> 1:54:40.620
for the heroes that you are.

1:54:42.034 --> 1:54:42.862
Carry on.

1:54:58.379 --> 1:55:01.344
- What was that look about?

1:55:01.379 --> 1:55:04.137
- How would Bridges
know about the pipeline?

1:55:04.172 --> 1:55:05.000
- The pendant.

1:55:09.310 --> 1:55:10.620
- I haven't given
it to anyone yet.

1:55:36.551 --> 1:55:37.758
- Confirming.

1:55:37.793 --> 1:55:40.517
Delta-three-nine-nine
charlie-six.

1:55:40.586 --> 1:55:42.172
- Confirmed.

1:55:42.206 --> 1:55:43.241
- New
assignment ready.

1:55:44.448 --> 1:55:45.275
- Go.

1:56:03.068 --> 1:56:04.241
- Well, this is interesting.

1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:07.689
I never thought we'd
be here, you and me.

1:56:10.275 --> 1:56:11.241
- Neither did I.

1:56:13.103 --> 1:56:14.275
- Did you hear about Dupree?

1:56:15.482 --> 1:56:16.379
She didn't do so well.

1:56:19.793 --> 1:56:21.000
- That's typical.

1:56:29.172 --> 1:56:30.344
Doesn't surprise me, though.

1:56:34.206 --> 1:56:35.344
She got ahead of herself.

1:56:38.206 --> 1:56:41.206
- So tell me, how do you
plan on getting out of this?

1:56:44.655 --> 1:56:49.241
- Let's just say, I
have a little faith.

1:56:54.448 --> 1:56:55.310
- Well, she better hurry.
