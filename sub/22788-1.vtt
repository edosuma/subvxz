<i>The Island of Sodor is
the home of the North Western Railway...</i>

00:11.478 --> 00:14.413

00:14.448 --> 00:16.648

00:16.683 --> 00:21.953

passengers to their destinations.</i>

00:21.988 --> 00:23.789
<i>There are branch lines</i>

00:23.824 --> 00:26.391
<i>that run along the coast
of the island,</i>

00:26.426 --> 00:29.895

the fishing villages</i>

00:29.930 --> 00:31.696

00:33.733 --> 00:38.637
<i>There are branch lines
that run to the farms, quarries</i>

00:38.672 --> 00:41.940
<i>and ancient castles
of the island's heartlands.</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:45.877

00:45.912 --> 00:49.815
Express coming through!

00:49.850 --> 00:53.785
<i>which runs all the way from Knapford

00:55.489 --> 00:57.656

00:57.691 --> 01:01.426

continues over the Vicarstown Bridge,</i>

01:01.461 --> 01:04.096

a very important goods train</i>

01:12.806 --> 01:14.873

01:17.077 --> 01:18.977
Faster! Faster!

01:19.012 --> 01:20.312
Hurry up, Henry!

01:20.347 --> 01:22.414
We haven't got all day!

01:25.051 --> 01:27.853
<i>A faulty signal
should have warned Henry</i>

01:27.888 --> 01:31.289

Well... My next job is
transporting beautiful music.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.700
That's not true.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.402
You're just making that up.

Okay. Oh. Ah.

- You're good.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.107
Oh, dear.

06:16.142 --> 06:19.077
Well, thank goodness
nobody was hurt.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.313
That's all I can say.

06:22.348 --> 06:27.218
That's right. Expect Henry to be
arriving at the Steamworks shortly.

06:27.253 --> 06:31.156
Edward is already at Vicarstown
collecting him with the breakdown train.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.092
Oh, I'm
used to swapping engines around.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.294
It's what I do all the time.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.898
I'll find another
engine to take James's passenger coaches,

06:39.933 --> 06:43.101
and he can collect those cars
first thing in the morning.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.304
I bet James won't like that job.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.140
James doesn't like pulling cars.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.982
Guess what, James.

06:58.017 --> 07:01.152
You're going to be pulling a
goods train tomorrow morning.

07:01.187 --> 07:05.056
While I will be working
with my faithful coaches again,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.158
Annie and Clarabel.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.860
Naturally.

all the important jobs!

08:11.658 --> 08:14.859
Important jobs?
What important jobs?

08:14.894 --> 08:18.162
Are you talking about taking
that goods train to Bridlington?

08:18.197 --> 08:21.032
Is Bridlington a place
on the mainland?

08:21.067 --> 08:25.370
Yes, Thomas, it is. But that's
hardly the only important job.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.673
What about the Flying Kipper?
Or the mail train?

08:28.708 --> 08:30.808
Or delivering the milk?

08:30.843 --> 08:33.977

from the cruise ships?

08:34.013 --> 08:36.681
I know, sir. But James says...

08:36.716 --> 08:41.019
Even looking after your branch
line is an important job, Thomas.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.488
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:43.523 --> 08:47.492
I have some important jobs
of my own to attend to.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.829
What with Henry out of action and
James off to the mainland tomorrow,

08:51.864 --> 08:55.934
who can I get to deliver
those cheese vats to Vicarstown?

<i>That night in the sheds,</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:04.609
<i>Thomas was still very cross
about James.</i>

09:04.644 --> 09:08.012
It's just so annoying, Percy.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.349
He keeps saying he's Sir
Topham Hatt's favorite engine.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.820
And tomorrow he's going off to the
mainland to have a big adventure,

09:15.855 --> 09:20.058
while I'm stuck here
doing the same jobs I always do.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.993
Percy.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.363
You're not even listening.
Oh, I am, Thomas.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.099
But I have to take
the mail train now.

The cars that Henry was pulling

Who's taken what train? What on
earth are you talking about, James?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.641
Thomas.
I'm talking about Thomas.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.177
He's taken my goods train, sir.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.846
The one that had to go
to the mainland.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.681
That's excellent.

11:23.716 --> 11:27.285

I was going to the mainland.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.492

11:43.870 --> 11:45.636
being useful.

11:45.671 --> 11:46.704
Huh? Huh?

11:46.739 --> 11:48.873

12:13.232 --> 12:15.666

12:15.701 --> 12:18.169

what that factory makes.

12:18.204 --> 12:22.406

see the color of those houses?

12:22.441 --> 12:24.776

12:24.811 --> 12:28.079
Nobody on Sodor would paint
their house bright blue.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.281
What are you
going on about, Thomas?

12:30.316 --> 12:33.484
Everything.
Just look around you.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.787
We're on the mainland now.

12:35.822 --> 12:39.423
Ooh. What's so special
about the mainland?

12:39.458 --> 12:42.160
It's all just grass and trees
as far as I can see.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.596
Lucky you. All I can see
is another truck's backside.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.867
There are lots of new things
to see here.

12:49.902 --> 12:53.004
The buildings are different
and the bridges and the...

12:53.039 --> 12:54.772
Oh, look.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.708
I wonder what junction
that is up ahead?

12:57.743 --> 13:00.278
I'd say it's Lostville.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.079
Maybe it's Confusington.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.790
But do you know where you are?

13:12.825 --> 13:14.625
He's trying to be important.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.961
Is it
important to go the wrong way?

13:16.996 --> 13:18.707
Go left. Don't listen to him.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.965
He's facing backwards.
Turn right!

13:21.000 --> 13:23.201
Would you all please be quiet?

13:25.404 --> 13:27.471

13:31.143 --> 13:33.311
- Use your brain.
- He doesn't have one.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.413
Stop trying to confuse me.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.616
Whoa! You're
distracting the driver!

13:38.651 --> 13:40.218

The faster I go,
the sooner I can get back

13:58.104 --> 14:01.038
and ask Sir Topham Hatt
for a better job!

14:01.073 --> 14:04.909
- A better job?
- A better job?

14:06.345 --> 14:09.413
Hello, Maithewaite!

14:12.084 --> 14:13.084
Oh!

14:16.789 --> 14:20.424
James! You've stopped
beyond the platform again!

14:21.928 --> 14:24.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.433
I know, I know.
It was an accident, okay?

14:29.468 --> 14:32.270
I do hope Thomas gets back soon.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.971
So do I.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.974
What are you all
muttering about back there?

14:37.009 --> 14:39.010
I <i> can</i> hear you, you know.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.582
<i>But Thomas was
far away on the mainland,</i>

14:44.617 --> 14:48.052
<i>and he wasn't going to be back
anytime soon.</i>

14:48.087 --> 14:53.624
You know, I still can't believe
how I tricked James this morning.

14:53.659 --> 14:56.827
And I still can't believe we haven't
reached that goods yard yet.

14:56.862 --> 15:00.665
I can.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.233
Are we there yet?

15:02.268 --> 15:05.236
I know it's taking a bit longer
than I thought,

15:05.271 --> 15:07.972
but why don't you relax
and enjoy the journey?

15:08.007 --> 15:09.974
It can't be that much further.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.375
Halt!

15:11.410 --> 15:13.110
Aaah!

15:15.548 --> 15:17.415
What's the big idea?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.285
Who goes there?

15:21.420 --> 15:23.254
Hello there.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.057
Is this Bridlington Goods Yard?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.292
Bridlington?

15:28.828 --> 15:30.227
No!

15:30.262 --> 15:32.296
Bridlington's miles from here.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.967
Oh. But am I at least
going the right way?

15:36.002 --> 15:38.669
How should I know?
Sometimes I go back here.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.871
Whoo-hoo!

15:40.906 --> 15:43.908
And sometimes I go up here.

15:46.445 --> 15:51.215
And I can spin around and look at
the view from every direction.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.585
Ow! But I've never been to Bridlington.
What's it like, eh?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.954
- Don't ask him.
- He hasn't been there either.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.390
And at this rate,
he's never going to get there!

16:00.793 --> 16:03.094
Oh, these trucks
are very annoying!

16:03.129 --> 16:05.162
But they're right.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.865
Please, Mr. Crane.
I really have to keep going.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
And why exactly
should I let you go?

16:09.935 --> 16:12.236
You haven't even answered
my question yet.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.472
Question? Wh-What question?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.507
Who goes there?

16:16.542 --> 16:20.444
Meaning, who... are... you?

16:20.479 --> 16:23.314
Oh. I'm Thomas.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.648
Thomas?

16:24.683 --> 16:25.883

<i>There was still no
sign of Bridlington Goods Yard,</i>

20:00.399 --> 20:01.899
Oh, dear.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.602
Now what?
We're lost in the woods.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.503
I told you
he didn't have a brain.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.639
Or a map. Or any coal.

20:08.674 --> 20:12.610
Shh. Look.
There's a place up ahead.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.646
Maybe we'll find
some coal there.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.816
I don't think so.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.891
Oh.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.663
This doesn't look like
a goods yard.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.699
No. It looks like a bads yard.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.302
A very bads yard.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.046
Are we there yet?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.649
Hello?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.352
Huh. Great job, Thomas.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.422
You are a really useless engine.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.392
Hello?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.260
Huh?

21:03.295 --> 21:05.296
Hi!

21:05.331 --> 21:06.964
Hi! Hi!

21:06.999 --> 21:08.399
- Pleased to meet ya.
- Huh?

21:09.301 --> 21:12.970
Well, hello there!

21:13.005 --> 21:15.506
Hello. Come on out, Theo.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.176
It's a visitor! Another engine.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.312
We have company!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.381
That's Theo. He's shy.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.350
Lack of confidence.

21:26.385 --> 21:29.920
He thinks he looks
awkward and uncoordinated.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.957
- Are you being scrapped?
- "Scrapped"?

21:33.992 --> 21:36.026
Dumped? Disassembled?

21:36.061 --> 21:37.661
Taken to pieces.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.197
Yes, engines get scrapped
when they're not useful

21:40.232 --> 21:41.865
and nobody cares
about them anymore.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.867
Don't be preposterous, Theo.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.403
This one here
is a useful engine.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.005
He's pulling cars.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.473
Not very well.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.108
Now, that's not fair.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.911
I-I have had
a few problems, but...

21:53.946 --> 21:55.846
Maybe you can help me out.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.414
Us? Help you?

21:57.449 --> 21:58.615
Oh, I doubt it.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.950
Oh, sorry, no.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.686
I don't think so!
Nope, nope, nope.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.356
You're barking up the wrong
branch line there, buddy boy!

22:05.391 --> 22:08.158
But I only need
a little coal and water.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.061
We can help with that.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.663
Back up, Theo.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.298
Back up!

22:14.333 --> 22:16.633
Coal and water
is no problem at all.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.269
We're fully stocked in the coal
and water department,

22:19.304 --> 22:22.707
in case our drivers come to try
new parts or make improvements.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.911
Why isn't he following us, Lexi?

22:27.946 --> 22:30.815
Hmm. I'm not sure.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.017
Why aren't you following us?

22:34.052 --> 22:37.454
I can't! I don't have any coal!

22:37.489 --> 22:39.056
He doesn't have any coal.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.225
Ah. Come on.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.193
You'll have to tow him
to the coal hopper.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.062
Me?

22:45.097 --> 22:46.997
- Oh.
- Come on, Theo.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.404
Whoo-hoo! All right! Hey!

22:53.439 --> 22:56.240
Okay, start pulling, Theo.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.679
Maybe you should uncouple
my cars first.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.182
- Ah.
- Good idea.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.487
Okay, Theo.
Give it the old one-two.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.860
Thanks, Theo.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.264
My name is Thomas.
I'm a tank engine.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.965
What kind of engine are you?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.635
Uh, we are experimental
engines, uh, Thomas.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.637
Experimental engines?

23:26.672 --> 23:29.473
Wow! What does that mean?

23:29.508 --> 23:30.841
It means we're different.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.676
Test models.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.311
Trial and error.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.414
I'm cab-forward, and Theo's...

23:37.916 --> 23:39.450
something experimental too.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.053
Oh, and there's Merlin too.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.388
Merlin?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.624
Oh, you won't have seen Merlin.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.762
He's a stealth engine.

23:51.797 --> 23:55.466
A stealth engine? What's that?

23:55.501 --> 23:58.702
Stealth engines
are designed to be hard to see.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.771
Out of sight. Poof.

24:00.806 --> 24:03.307
Invisible.

24:03.342 --> 24:06.510
An invisible engine?

24:06.545 --> 24:07.978
Well...

24:08.013 --> 24:11.882
Let's just say
he's always "disappearing."

24:11.917 --> 24:14.218
Uh, your water tank
is overflowing.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.953
Whoa, Nellie!

24:15.988 --> 24:17.855
Up to the brim.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.590
Thanks for your help,

24:19.625 --> 24:22.192
but I still have my very
important job to finish.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.861
Does that mean you have to go?

24:23.896 --> 24:26.396
He's got cars, Theo, remember?

24:26.431 --> 24:29.800
Cars need to be delivered.
That's what they're for.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.202
Oh. I almost forgot.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.471
Do either of you know where
Bridlington Goods Yard is?

24:34.506 --> 24:37.274
Bridlington? Oh. No idea.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.876
Mmm... Sorry, no.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.044
Oh.

24:42.548 --> 24:46.950
<i>So with coal in his coal
bunker and his water tank full,</i>

24:46.985 --> 24:50.487
<i>Thomas set off once more
in search of the goods yard.</i>

24:50.522 --> 24:53.290
- Are we there yet?
- I don't think so.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.092
Thomas still doesn't know
where he's going.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.495
And those other engines
didn't know anything either.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.764
But look. There's a light.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.166
That's probably
the goods yard now.

25:03.201 --> 25:04.601
- And if it's not?
- Well,

25:04.636 --> 25:06.603
if it's not,

25:06.638 --> 25:09.172
then we can stop
and ask for directions again.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.841
Or get another engine.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.509
Who knows where he's going.

25:23.121 --> 25:25.222
Thomas?

25:25.257 --> 25:28.726
I have a feeling
we're not on Sodor anymore.

25:38.937 --> 25:40.837
Wow.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.606
Would you look at that.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.708
Oh.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.644
Oh, wow!

25:47.679 --> 25:51.748
I bet James has never been
anyplace like this.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.183
Hello?

25:53.218 --> 25:54.618
Who's there?

25:56.221 --> 25:59.256
Oh! What's your name,
little tank engine?

25:59.291 --> 26:01.992
Oh. My name is Thomas.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.027
And my name is Hurricane.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.063
You know, like a storm.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.898
Whoosh!

26:07.933 --> 26:09.700
Wow!

26:09.735 --> 26:11.368
And I'm Frankie.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.005
But you look like you must be
a very important little engine.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.474
That's not
what my friend James says.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.444
He keeps boasting about how
he's Sir Topham Hatt's favorite.

26:20.479 --> 26:21.979
Oh, really?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.815
And what do you do when he
says something like that?

26:24.850 --> 26:28.652
I get up extra early and take the cars <i> he</i>
was supposed to deliver to the mainland.

26:30.455 --> 26:33.223
Well, isn't he a clever little
tank engine, Hurricane?

26:33.258 --> 26:37.494
Ha. And a cheeky one too,
Frankie.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.898
I'd say he's a keeper,
wouldn't you?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.369
Do either of you know where
Bridlington Goods Yard is?

26:45.404 --> 26:48.205
I have to deliver these cars,
and it's nearly nighttime.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.874
Of course we know Bridlington.

26:50.909 --> 26:53.243
I deliver
goods there all the time.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.911
You do?

26:54.946 --> 26:58.181
You mustn't worry about
going to the goods yard tonight.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.816
Uncouple those cars.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.985
Leave them here in the yard.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.222
We'll look after them for you,
Thomas. No <i> problemo.</i>

27:05.257 --> 27:07.691
Yes. Come on inside.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.693
We'll keep you nice and warm.

Just think how jealous
your friend James will be

30:05.937 --> 30:09.706
when he hears about your
new job, Thomas.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.107
New job?

30:11.142 --> 30:14.044
I already have
a very important job.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.980
I'm delivering cars to the
mainland instead of James.

30:17.015 --> 30:20.650
Oh, quiet
now, little tank engine.

30:20.685 --> 30:24.187
We can worry about those cars
of yours in the morning.

30:24.222 --> 30:27.257
What you need
is a nice comfy shed

30:27.292 --> 30:31.795
where you can relax and let that
busy boiler of yours cool down.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.238
<i>That night in Tidmouth Sheds,</i>

30:41.273 --> 30:45.175
<i>the other engines were wondering
what had happened to Thomas.</i>

30:45.210 --> 30:47.677
He really should have
been back by now.

30:47.712 --> 30:50.513
I know. I'm feeling worried.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.216
So am I. Do you think
something's happened?

30:53.251 --> 30:56.586
Oh, knowing Thomas, he probably
got lost on the mainland

30:56.621 --> 30:58.822
or fell down a mine...

30:58.857 --> 31:01.625
or crashed into
a stationmaster's house.

31:04.095 --> 31:06.363
He... What?

31:06.398 --> 31:08.265
It's not funny, James.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.367
Thomas could be in trouble.
Hmph.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.469
It serves Thomas right
if he's in trouble.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.205
It was never his job
to go to the mainland at all.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.841
He took my cars without asking.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.911
Maybe you could go
and look for him, James.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.879
Me? Why me?

31:22.914 --> 31:25.782
Because I'd be scared.

31:25.817 --> 31:30.420
And, well, I thought you
wanted to go to the mainland.

31:30.455 --> 31:31.521
Hmm.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.164
Aaah! What was that?

31:41.199 --> 31:45.268
Time to start
work, little tank engine.

31:45.303 --> 31:48.405
Whoa! Give me a
chance to wake up first.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.307
Hey.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.842
What happened to my goods cars?

31:52.877 --> 31:54.711
Oh, I took care of them.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.880
I took them to Bridlington
in the night.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.381
Did you?

31:58.416 --> 31:59.983
Uh, thank you.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.585
If my cars have been delivered
to Bridlington,

32:02.620 --> 32:05.088
then my very important job
has been completed,

32:05.123 --> 32:07.424
so I need to head back to Sodor.

32:07.459 --> 32:11.494
But we helped you deliver your
goods cars, little tank engine.

32:11.529 --> 32:14.397
Surely, you don't mind
helping us in return.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.967
Well, okay.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.202
I suppose I... Whoa!

32:22.440 --> 32:24.975
You're too kind.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.819
<i>Thomas was put
to work in the steelworks,</i>

32:35.854 --> 32:37.854
<i>shunting ladle cars...</i> Ready!

32:37.889 --> 32:40.891
<i>and taking molten slag out
to the slag heaps.</i> I got it!

33:07.185 --> 33:10.653
Cinders and ashes?

33:10.688 --> 33:12.756
Good job, Thomas!

33:12.791 --> 33:15.225
He is good, isn't he?

33:15.260 --> 33:18.862
In fact, I'd say he might be
my favorite new engine.

You need to be careful with that stuff.
It's very hot.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.921

Oh, Thomas.

34:12.183 --> 34:16.018
<i>Now arriving at Platform
5 is the Great Wooden Special.</i>

34:16.054 --> 34:18.021
Any news about Thomas, sir?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.690
No, Percy. Not yet.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.827
The cars arrived at Bridlington
in the middle of the night,

34:23.862 --> 34:26.474
but nobody knows what's happened to Thomas.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.232
I've got an idea, sir.

34:29.266 --> 34:32.969
Why don't I go to the
mainland and look for Thomas?

34:33.004 --> 34:35.004
Wouldn't that be really useful?

34:35.039 --> 34:36.906
It's kind of you
to volunteer, James,

34:36.940 --> 34:39.809
but I need you to work
on Thomas's branch line.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.011
There are still carrots
waiting in Ulfstead

34:42.045 --> 34:43.980
and cars full of tweezers
in Vicarstown.

34:44.014 --> 34:47.050
But I <i> want</i> to go
to the mainland, sir.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.987
After all, I was the one who was
supposed to go, not Thomas.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.188
I've already sent Emily off
with the Kipper.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.458
- Uh, what about...
- And Edward is collecting the band.

34:55.493 --> 34:58.695
- I mean, someone...
- I simply can't spare another engine.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.197
- But I want to...
- Not with Henry at the Steamworks

35:01.232 --> 35:02.899
and Thomas delayed.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.603
Delayed? Oh, no!
I only thought he was lost.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.304
All done, sir.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.907
And I've made you
a fresh pot of tea.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.609
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.111
Don't worry, Percy.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.313
Everything is under control.

35:17.348 --> 35:20.383
Just keep calm and carry on.

35:20.418 --> 35:22.819
At least you tried, James.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.623
Hmph. I'll never get to go
to the mainland now.

35:34.332 --> 35:39.502
Oh, this... is...
thirsty... work.

35:39.537 --> 35:43.873
That's what we've been trying to
tell you, little tank engine.

35:43.908 --> 35:47.076
This really is
the hottest place in town.

35:47.111 --> 35:51.080
My name is Thomas, Frankie.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.383
And you're doing a terrific job.

35:53.418 --> 35:56.452
Hurricane and I
are very impressed.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.354
And with you here to help us,

35:58.389 --> 36:01.691
we're free
to make more deliveries!

36:01.726 --> 36:05.828
It's not easy to keep up with all the
work here when it's only Frankie and me.

36:05.863 --> 36:08.598
We're both so happy
that you came along, Thomas.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.967
- Oh, thanks...
- Hurricane.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.835
This steel won't deliver itself.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.905
Bye, Thomas. See you later.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.878
Put the ingots
in the cooling area

36:21.913 --> 36:26.082
and make sure you empty <i>all</i> the slag
onto the slag heap, little tank engine.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.652
And when you've done all of that,
you can sort out cars in the yard.

36:29.687 --> 36:34.224
I expect them ready when we get
back to collect the next delivery.

36:34.259 --> 36:37.060
But I need to go home
to Sodor now, Frankie.

36:37.095 --> 36:39.829
No way, little tank engine.

36:39.864 --> 36:43.099
We helped you.
So you have to help us.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.635
But... I <i> have</i> been helping you.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.605
I've been working hard all day.

Yes, James.
That's what Thomas would do.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.363
Wait for the farmer.
What else can you do?

40:00.398 --> 40:02.698
I can blow my whistle.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.201
That'll get those sheep moving.
No!

40:05.236 --> 40:09.238
That's mean! You'll frighten
them, and they'll panic.

40:09.273 --> 40:13.309
Even Thomas is more
patient than you are, James.

40:13.344 --> 40:17.413
I've had enough. This is boring!

40:25.490 --> 40:27.089
See, James?

40:27.124 --> 40:30.793
All it takes
is a little patience.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.195
Baa.

40:45.510 --> 40:50.079
That was a close
call there, little tank engine.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.815
Yeah, you could have done yourself
some serious damage, Thomas,

40:52.850 --> 40:54.217
going off the rails like that.

40:56.254 --> 40:59.755
That old track
hasn't been used for years.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.158
And how would
we manage without you?

41:02.193 --> 41:06.362
You can't expect Hurricane and I to
be doing all of that dirty work.

41:06.397 --> 41:09.098
We have more important jobs
to be doing.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.635
I suppose so.

41:17.475 --> 41:22.478
<i>That night on Sodor,
James was more grumpy than ever.</i>

41:22.513 --> 41:27.617
I've had enough of being stuck on
Thomas's backwater branch line.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.752
I should be the one
on the mainland.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.888
Of course you should, James.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.056
Then you could be the one
who got lost.

41:35.793 --> 41:39.228
Or even worse, delayed.

41:39.263 --> 41:42.899
Hmph! I wouldn't get
lost <i>or</i> delayed.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.234
And if Thomas isn't
back here by morning,

41:45.269 --> 41:49.372
I'm going to the mainland to find
him and bring him back home.

41:49.407 --> 41:52.775
And who's going to look after all the
passengers on Thomas's branch line

41:52.810 --> 41:54.677
while you're gone, James?

41:54.712 --> 41:57.313
I don't know. Why don't
you ask Sir Topham Hatt?

41:57.348 --> 42:00.216
It's his job
to swap engines around.

42:00.251 --> 42:04.020
"That's what a
railway controller does."

42:04.055 --> 42:07.823
Oh, James. You'll be a hero!

42:10.428 --> 42:14.063
Only if he manages
to <i> find</i> Thomas.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.969
James. Wait!

42:20.004 --> 42:21.170
Where are you going?

42:21.205 --> 42:23.072
To the mainland.

42:23.107 --> 42:28.211
To find Thomas
and become... a hero!

43:42.219 --> 43:43.953
Shh.

43:55.433 --> 43:57.867
Oh! What was that?

43:57.902 --> 43:59.669
What was what?

43:59.704 --> 44:01.704
That big crashing sound.

44:01.739 --> 44:04.640
Maybe it was the thunder.

44:04.675 --> 44:07.910
There's a storm coming.

44:07.945 --> 44:08.945
Thomas?

44:11.248 --> 44:13.282
Thomas!

44:15.820 --> 44:18.221
He's trying to
break the gates down!

44:20.424 --> 44:22.992
No, Thomas! Don't do it!

44:23.027 --> 44:25.361
Stop, Thomas. Stop!

44:25.396 --> 44:27.030
Thomas!

44:32.737 --> 44:34.437
Come back!

44:41.312 --> 44:43.146
Oh, they're after me!

44:47.051 --> 44:48.484
Oh!

44:57.094 --> 44:59.195
Oh! Hurry up!

45:00.131 --> 45:01.397
They're coming.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.233
They're coming!

45:10.808 --> 45:12.642
They <i> are</i> chasing after me.

45:15.112 --> 45:17.113
Ooh.

45:17.148 --> 45:20.550
Are you... hiding?

45:21.285 --> 45:23.452
Who said that?

45:23.487 --> 45:27.089
Oh, don't be frightened.
I'm hiding too!

45:27.124 --> 45:28.891
I love hiding.

45:28.926 --> 45:31.194
But where are you?

45:32.096 --> 45:33.462
I can't see you.

45:33.497 --> 45:35.598
Of course you can't.

45:35.633 --> 45:38.634
That's because I'm such a good hider.

45:38.669 --> 45:42.037
In fact, I'm invisible!

45:43.641 --> 45:48.110
Invisible?
How can you be invisible?

45:48.145 --> 45:50.713
Because I'm a stealth engine.

45:50.748 --> 45:54.016
And stealth engines are designed
in a special way to make them...

45:54.051 --> 45:56.185
invisible.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.187
A stealth engine?

45:58.823 --> 46:01.290
Like... Merlin?

46:01.325 --> 46:06.295
Not <i> like</i> Merlin. I <i> am</i> Merlin.

46:06.330 --> 46:10.833
The experimental prototype, King
Arthur-class stealth engine.

46:10.868 --> 46:13.102
Merlin. Wow!

46:13.137 --> 46:15.304
Is that really you?

46:15.339 --> 46:17.473
I heard all about you from Theo
and Lexi and...

46:17.508 --> 46:19.742
Quick, close your eyes.

46:22.246 --> 46:25.515
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

46:34.992 --> 46:37.293
Don't worry. You're safe.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.661
They won't find you now.

46:38.696 --> 46:41.597
You're with the best hider ever.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.668
All you have to do is close
your eyes and keep really still,

46:45.703 --> 46:48.905
and nobody will be able
to see you.

47:04.922 --> 47:09.458
Hello? Merlin? Are you there?

47:09.493 --> 47:13.195
Oh, or are you still asleep?

47:13.230 --> 47:15.664
Sorry.

47:15.699 --> 47:19.302
Merlin? Merlin?

47:26.210 --> 47:30.379
<i>That morning, James had
arrived at Bridlington Goods Yard.</i>

47:30.414 --> 47:34.050
Thomas! Thomas!

47:39.690 --> 47:41.657
Excuse me.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.826
But have you, by any chance,

47:43.861 --> 47:48.964
seen a cheeky blue tank engine with
the number 1 painted on his side?

47:48.999 --> 47:52.801
We get a lot of engines
passing through.

47:52.836 --> 47:56.605
You can't expect me to remember
every blue tank engine.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.808
His name is Thomas,
from the Island of Sodor.

47:59.843 --> 48:04.213
Ulli! You seen a cheeky blue
tank engine, numbered 1?

48:05.616 --> 48:08.450
Nope. Like I say, friend.

48:08.485 --> 48:11.420
We get a lot of engines
coming and going.

48:11.455 --> 48:16.058
Bridlington is
a very busy goods yard.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.027
Oh, well.

48:18.062 --> 48:20.029
Thank you anyway.

48:20.798 --> 48:21.897
Psst.

48:21.932 --> 48:24.500
We saw a silly blue tank engine.

48:24.535 --> 48:27.703
Didn't know where he was going.

48:27.738 --> 48:31.807
- No sense.
- Of direction.

48:31.842 --> 48:35.844
Yes. Yes!
That sounds like Thomas.

48:35.879 --> 48:37.947
Is he the engine
that brought you here?

48:37.982 --> 48:41.283
- No!
- Don't be silly.

48:41.318 --> 48:43.686
Thomas got completely lost.

48:43.721 --> 48:46.655
An engine called Hurricane
brought us here.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.958
Hurricane? Who's Hurricane?

48:48.993 --> 48:52.261

49:11.982 --> 49:16.686
Do you know a big steelworks where an
engine called Hurricane might be working?

49:27.998 --> 49:31.467

"Bridlingdom"? That goods yard?

49:55.859 --> 49:57.292
No.

49:57.327 --> 49:59.995

50:00.030 --> 50:01.230
No.

50:01.265 --> 50:03.866

I don't see them. Huh?

50:03.901 --> 50:06.235
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

50:06.270 --> 50:08.504
He <i> is</i> being scrapped.
I told you.

50:08.539 --> 50:11.774
No, Theo.
I'm not being scrapped.

50:11.809 --> 50:15.311
But... I probably should be.

50:18.082 --> 50:20.849
Oh, Thomas. What happened?

50:20.884 --> 50:24.386
I lost James's cars, and I got
trapped in the steelworks,

50:24.421 --> 50:27.990
and I want to go home to Sodor,
but I don't know the way.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.626
I'm a useless engine.

50:30.661 --> 50:33.429

- You sound like one of us.
- Yep.

50:35.899 --> 50:38.200

see him so easily.

53:35.812 --> 53:38.413
But it didn't work at all.

53:38.448 --> 53:39.848
Only don't try and tell Merlin.

53:39.883 --> 53:40.816
Ah!

53:40.851 --> 53:42.951

Isn't that right?

54:36.506 --> 54:38.874
So do you think
you can try to help me?

54:38.909 --> 54:41.109
Didn't we just explain, Thomas?

54:41.144 --> 54:43.278
We can't do anything.

54:43.313 --> 54:45.947
Oh, stop saying that.

54:45.982 --> 54:49.284
We'll do everything we can
to help you, Thomas.

54:49.319 --> 54:51.086
Just tell us
what the problem is.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.088
Oh, Merlin, thank you!

54:53.123 --> 54:56.058
I need to go home
to the Island of Sodor.

54:56.093 --> 54:58.994
Only I don't know
which way to go.

54:59.029 --> 55:02.164
Merlin can't help you.
None of us can.

55:02.199 --> 55:03.865
I'm terribly sorry.

55:03.900 --> 55:07.402
We don't know anything about
anyplace other than here.

55:07.437 --> 55:11.840
Oh, but we can still try to
help you, Thomas. Oh, oh!

55:11.875 --> 55:13.208
We can go with you.

55:13.243 --> 55:17.379
And help you find the way
to the Island of Sonar!

55:17.414 --> 55:20.349
And then we'll
all get lost, Merlin.

55:20.384 --> 55:22.451
Or...

55:22.486 --> 55:25.587
you could always stay here with us,
Thomas, instead of going home.

55:25.622 --> 55:26.955
Thanks, Theo.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.291
Thanks all of you,
but I'll be all right.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.960
I'll find my way home...

55:31.995 --> 55:33.128
somehow.

55:34.264 --> 55:35.797
Bye, Thomas.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.733
Good luck. Oh.

55:40.070 --> 55:42.804
<i>Thomas headed back
along the branch line again,</i>

55:42.839 --> 55:45.708
<i>trying to remember the route
he'd taken before.</i>

55:46.710 --> 55:49.144
Mmm, this looks familiar.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.215
Oh, I think
I recognize this place.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.217
It looks like that canal I saw.

55:55.252 --> 55:57.052
Yes, it is!

55:57.087 --> 56:00.222
Oh, but there's
that silly crane.

56:00.257 --> 56:02.991
I really don't want him
to stop me again.

56:05.228 --> 56:08.430
Oh, no, you don't.

56:08.465 --> 56:09.998
Hey!

56:10.033 --> 56:12.667
You won't get past
so easily this time.

56:12.702 --> 56:16.271
What are you doing?
Stop that! Let go of me!

56:16.306 --> 56:18.106
Hello again, Thomas.

56:18.141 --> 56:22.210
Last time we met, you played a
cheeky trick on me and ran away.

56:22.245 --> 56:24.646
Just as we were getting
to know each other too.

56:24.681 --> 56:27.883
That wasn't a very nice way
to end our conversation.

56:27.918 --> 56:30.001
Picking up engines with
your hook is not a

56:30.013 --> 56:32.254
very nice way to start
a conversation either.

56:32.289 --> 56:35.657
Put me down! Please?

56:35.692 --> 56:39.761
And if I do put you down,
then what will you do, hmm?

56:39.796 --> 56:41.630
Run away again, no doubt.

56:41.665 --> 56:45.400
And I'll be left all on my own
again with nobody to talk to.

56:45.435 --> 56:49.438
Now, why don't you tell me
all about your adventures?

56:49.473 --> 56:51.840
My name's Beresford.
We could be friends.

56:51.875 --> 56:56.211
Look, I'm sorry I tricked you
last time, Beresford,

56:56.246 --> 57:00.882
but you can't just make somebody be your
friend by making them stay with you.

57:00.917 --> 57:04.486
You have to be nice to them
so they wanna be your friend.

57:05.222 --> 57:07.989
Now, put me down.

57:08.024 --> 57:11.993
Whoa!

57:12.028 --> 57:15.030
Hurricane!

57:15.065 --> 57:18.266
Pick me up, Beresford!
You have to hide me.

57:18.301 --> 57:20.969
Put you down? Pick you up?
Hide you?

57:21.004 --> 57:22.637
Make your mind up, Thomas.

57:22.672 --> 57:25.040
Hide me. Hide me! Please!

57:25.075 --> 57:26.675
I really need you to.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.410
Somewhere I can't be seen
from the tracks.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.711
Hurry!

57:30.480 --> 57:33.482
Whoa!

57:33.517 --> 57:36.885
Oh, yes. It's true.

57:36.920 --> 57:38.653
James.

57:38.688 --> 57:41.890
I am a particularly
useful engine.

57:41.925 --> 57:43.625
Is that right?

57:43.660 --> 57:49.097
In fact, back on Sodor, I am
Sir Topham Hatt's favorite.

57:50.901 --> 57:53.268
Okay, Thomas. They're all gone.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.971
And I did something
nice for you.

57:56.006 --> 57:58.373
So we can be friends now.

57:58.408 --> 57:59.441
What shall we talk about?

57:59.476 --> 58:02.644
James! They've got James!

58:02.679 --> 58:04.279
Who's James?

58:04.314 --> 58:06.147
Yes. Who's James?

58:06.182 --> 58:08.750
Merlin! What are you doing here?

58:08.785 --> 58:10.752
I followed you, Thomas.

58:10.787 --> 58:16.057
I'm here to look after you and make sure
you find your way safely back home.

58:16.092 --> 58:18.426
Excellent hiding, by the way.
Even I couldn't see you.

58:18.461 --> 58:20.829
But I can't go home now!

58:20.864 --> 58:23.231
I have to help my friend James!

58:23.266 --> 58:26.001
Why didn't you say something?
I could have stopped him.

58:27.070 --> 58:28.804
Oh!

58:30.340 --> 58:33.842
Oh! You have to let
me go now, Beresford.

58:33.877 --> 58:35.810
James is in trouble.

58:35.845 --> 58:40.181
If I hadn't taken his cars in the first
place, he wouldn't even be here.

58:40.216 --> 58:44.352
And now Hurricane and Frankie are
taking him to the steelworks.

58:44.387 --> 58:46.621
I have to rescue him.

58:46.656 --> 58:49.858
Don't you mean

This is all very entertaining,
but where's Thomas?

59:32.268 --> 59:34.836
Uh, Thomas? Who's Thomas?

59:34.871 --> 59:39.374
He's a small blue tank engine
from the Island of Sodor.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.410
But I think you already
know that,

59:42.445 --> 59:45.580
because one of you
delivered his cars,

59:45.615 --> 59:46.748
Hurricane.

59:46.783 --> 59:48.883
- Uh, T-T...
- Oh, oh!

59:48.918 --> 59:50.652
<i>That</i> blue tank engine.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.153
He's long gone.

59:52.188 --> 59:53.888
But where did he go?

59:53.923 --> 59:55.757
- Anywhere.
- Everywhere.

59:55.792 --> 59:57.626
I think he wanted
to see the world.

59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.996
Well, I need to find him
and bring him back to Sodor.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.366
Of course, he did say
he was coming straight back.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.701
He wasn't going off
to see the whole world,

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.069
just a bit of it.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.405
You might as well
wait here for him.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.745
And make yourself useful.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.617
<i>We</i> have to rescue him?

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.487
What do you mean
we have to rescue him?

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:27.756
We can't do anything.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.092
But we can try. We have to try.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:35.263
I don't know what I can do either,
Theo, but James is my friend.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.832
And Thomas is our friend.

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:40.869
And friends help each other.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.281
- Yes, yes, but...
- Indeed we do.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.905
I certainly think so.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.208
This is the most excitement
I've had in...

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.845
forever!

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:02.424
So, how are we going
to rescue Thomas's friend?

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.392
We need a plan.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.628
Thomas broke the gates open
before.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.697
That's the ticket.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:10.865
We could do the same thing.
Yeah.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.701
Or... and just hear me out...

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:15.303
we could leave the gates
where they are.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:20.508
Oh! I can use the powers of stealth
to sneak in and rescue James.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.277
Nobody will see me.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:25.113
Invisibility on.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.349
Or...

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:31.152
why don't Theo and Lexi
create a diversion?

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:34.456
They could pretend to have
an accident and call for help,

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:38.026
and while the gates are open,
I can rush in and rescue James.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.828
But what am I going to do?

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.898
You'll have to stay back here
and keep watch, Merlin.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:47.635
Keeping watch is
the most important job of all.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.671
Oh, yes.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.673
C-Couldn't I stay back here too
and just watch?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.274
No, Theo.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:56.778
You and Lexi need to
create a conversion.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.813
I'm the one who's
going to keep watch.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.050
Come on, Theo! Oh.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.818
Don't worry, Thomas.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:06.020
Those two are bound
to be a little nervous.

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:09.124
They're not as used to
having adventures as we are.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:14.662
I think I can't. I think I can't.
I know I can't.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.664
Whoa! Speed up, Theo.

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:19.267
Move along, move along.
You need to go fast.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.806
Now, Theo! Stop!

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:32.080
What was that? I don't know.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.648
Help! Help!

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.984
There's been a derailment!

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:40.021
Engine off the line!
Emergency! Emergency!

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.446
James.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:07.616
James.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:11.219
James! Where are you?

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:16.691
Oh, no! What's happened?

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:21.396
- Has someone fallen to pieces?
- Have you had an accident?

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:26.434
You look kind of messed up, like your
pistons are in the wrong places.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.037
Hmm, I'm confused.

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:31.840
I thought somebody said
there had been a derailment.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.543
Um...

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.446
This is taking too long.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.882
T-Thomas should have
been out by now.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.750
Ah! I hope nothing's
happened to him.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:45.386
What if he needs my help?

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:48.890
Invisibility on!

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:54.095
Ah, oh, well,
there was a kind of derailment.

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.197
Lexi! Bit of an accident.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:58.967
Came off the rails.
Whoopsy! He fell right over.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.403
Merlin?
Lexi!

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:05.607
Wait a minute! Where's he going?

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:07.842
Whoa! Stop!

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:11.213
Ohh!

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:22.023
Oh, all this soot, ash and heat
will positively ruin my paintwork.

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:25.159
This is a horrible job for an
engine like... James.

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:29.697
James. Oh, so there you are!

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:32.800
What do you think you've
been playing at? James.

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:36.037
Keep your voice down. First you
take my cars to the mainland.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:39.908
I'll explain later, James.
We really need to go.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:42.911
- Oh, I'm more than ready to go.
- James.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.947
I'd already decided that I was
just going to do this one job.

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:48.349
It doesn't work like that,
James.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.686
Frankie and Hurricane
won't <i> let</i> you leave.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:55.023
Thomas. You need to hurry!

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:58.693
They're coming back!
They're coming back!

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.729
Thomas!

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.598
They're back.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.401
Quick, James! We've got to
get out of here now!

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.436
Go!

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:12.173
Stop! You
can't leave us on our own!

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.609
Aaah! No.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.044
Look out!

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.481
Take the tracks that go
around the building, James!

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.119
Ohh!

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.459
Oh!

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.461
We can't just let you leave.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:36.764
You're our favorite new engine!
Leave me alone!

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.510
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:56.117
Found you!

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.156
Whoa!

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.828
Whoa!

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:11.032
Oh, no!
Yeah.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.401
Whoa!

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.770
Oh, no, you don't!

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.406
- What?
- Go, James, go!

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.685
Ohh!

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.888
Run away! Scram! Skedaddle!

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:44.432
Help! Help!

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:47.936
Whoa!

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:54.175
- No!
- Don't worry. I'll get you down, Thomas.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.011
No!

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:11.793
Thomas! Look out!

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:15.897
Help! My front wheels!
I'm melting!

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:17.465
I'm melting!

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.301
Oh, Hurricane!

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:24.105
What should I do? Anything!

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.009
Whoo-hoo.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.479
Oh!

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:35.483
Hurricane can't make deliveries
with melted wheels,

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.285
and now you're
all going to go away

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.288
and leave us on our own
with no help at all!

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:43.791
It serves you right, after all the
things you've done to Thomas.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:47.061
Aye. Keeping him here
when he wanted to go home.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.963
And trying to trick his friend.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:52.634
But... But...

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:57.371
Frankie, are you all right?

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.174
We only wanted some help.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:04.479
There's too much work
for just the two of us.

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.048
But why didn't you ask for help?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.951
Nobody wants to work here.

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:13.387
All the other engines
are too busy to help us.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:16.756
Don't cry, Frankie.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:19.660
Maybe some engines
aren't as busy as you think.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:22.330
What? What do you mean?

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.300
Wait? Us? I don't think so!

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:28.469
Nope. Nope. No sirree, Bob.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.671
We're really useless engines.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:34.008
Useless? You're not useless.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.243
No engine is useless.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.379
Didn't you just help me
rescue James?

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:40.281
Think positively, Lexi.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.683
Ask yourself what <i> can</i> you do?

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:45.586
You mean anything?

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.221
No, uh, we can't do anything.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:50.792
But we can try.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:58.399
<i>So Thomas and James
headed back to Sodor together.</i>

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:02.203
I'm sorry I took your cars,
James.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:05.305
I know you wanted to be the one
to bring them to the mainland.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.642
And I'm sorry about teasing you.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:11.045
I'm not really anyone's
favorite engine.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.247
If anyone's the favorite,
Thomas, it's probably you.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.783
Don't be silly, James.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.354
