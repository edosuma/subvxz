WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.168
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.252 --> 00:03.378
These are GPS
ankle monitors.

00:03.461 --> 00:06.006
Now, step up, take one
and put it on.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.258
When the
exchange is over,

00:08.341 --> 00:10.301
you and I are gonna spend
some quality time.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.803
These aren't release papers.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.388
I did the best I could do.

00:13.471 --> 00:16.182
You need to sign those so I can
collect Roland's device.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.475
You want me to give up
the one thing

00:17.559 --> 00:19.310
that makes me
valuable to the team.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.062
Hey, you knew the deal
when you came on board.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.397
Do you want to flush it
down the toilet

00:22.480 --> 00:24.065
because you made
a bad move?

00:24.149 --> 00:27.444
This man just came into
a $100,000 inheritance.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.653
I don't recognize him.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.031
If you do see him, would you
please give us a call?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.199
You don't work
for the IRS?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.285
I don't.
Who do you work for?

00:35.368 --> 00:36.953
As of now... myself.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.247
I'm an associate
of General Krantz.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.750
The general, he
likes his privacy.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.965
I knew you were rotten
from the beginning,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.633
so I want you to
walk me through this

00:50.717 --> 00:53.511
and if you can't, I'm gonna
call the authorities.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.056
Cole Pfeiffer.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.643
Who the hell are you?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.039
The last time

01:21.122 --> 01:23.083
a pretty little
filly like yourself

01:23.166 --> 01:26.503
knocked me senseless
and tied me to a chair,

01:26.586 --> 01:28.588
I had to pay for it.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.590
You still might.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.843
That book was a gift

01:33.927 --> 01:35.011
from a very dear
friend of mine

01:35.095 --> 01:38.014
who left this
realm all too soon.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.892
The only thing that James
Whistler ever gave anybody

01:40.975 --> 01:42.268
was the clap.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.150
You have thirty seconds
to tell me something

01:49.234 --> 01:51.111
that I don't already know.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.115
I followed that book
from Panama City,

01:55.198 --> 01:59.494
where James Whistler and
I were co-incarcerated,

01:59.577 --> 02:01.496
to a bus locker
in San Diego.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.958
Inside was information
pertaining to this apartment...

02:06.209 --> 02:07.460
Scylla.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.378
How about that?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.587
That ring a bell, huh? Huh?

02:09.671 --> 02:11.798
What do you
know about Scylla?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.385
I know
I'm holding the keys,

02:15.468 --> 02:18.179
because without me,
that bird book's

02:18.263 --> 02:20.849
about as meaningful
as a fart in a wind storm.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.726
I commandeered
Whistler's alias.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.020
I infiltrated
his place of business

02:26.104 --> 02:29.023
because it's the gateway
to the whole damn thing.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.359
Where's the location?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.363
What do you bring
to the jamboree, darling, huh?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.199
Aside from those baby blues

02:38.283 --> 02:39.367
and a knife?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.665
This is me.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.002
This is Scylla.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.047
This is you.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.927
I am gonna get Scylla.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.014
And it can either
be with you...

03:03.516 --> 03:04.559
or through you.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.688
So why don't you give me

03:08.771 --> 03:11.649
that informed
decision right now,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.861
before I spill your hillbilly
guts all over the carpet?

03:16.112 --> 03:18.114
'Cause you're messing
with the wrong bitch.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.247
How may I be of service?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.126
This is unbelievable.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.169
We were planning our move

03:31.252 --> 03:33.338
on Scuderi when
he chartered the flight.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.465
Right, and no chance
you dragged your feet a little bit

03:35.548 --> 03:36.883
waiting for Scuderi to
charter the flight?

03:36.966 --> 03:38.551
Oh, yeah, we want
to drag this out.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.887
Yeah, well, location's pretty convenient,
wouldn't you say, Linc?

03:40.970 --> 03:42.555
Uh, Scuderi
splitting town

03:42.639 --> 03:44.224
kind of caught us
a break, huh?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.683
Would you shut
him up?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.143
No, no.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.604
We could just wait till he comes back.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.356
AgriSow makes farm chemicals.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.315
It's not Fort Knox.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.316
You want to bet?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.109
Their patents are
worth billions.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.654
Which is why companies tend
to keep a very close eye

03:57.737 --> 03:58.988
on those patents.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.615
Yeah, we could breach
their security,

04:00.698 --> 04:01.574
in a week, minimum.
We could get

04:01.658 --> 04:03.243
in the guy's house--
week, minimum.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.495
Or we could follow the guys
for twelve hours out of town

04:05.578 --> 04:07.664
and have card five by midnight.
How's that sound?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.082
How does this sound?

04:09.165 --> 04:11.334
If you're not back by midnight
you're going to jail.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.669
Yeah, don't I know it.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.088
Let's talk outside.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.051
So what's the plan?

04:21.844 --> 04:23.304
We're going to Vegas.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.640
Oh, hell yes!

04:25.723 --> 04:27.350
Yo, I call shotgun!

04:27.433 --> 04:28.393
Huh? Who's got-- Hey.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.978
Yeah!

04:36.943 --> 04:38.611
So what do you want
to talk about, Agent Self?

04:38.695 --> 04:39.821
I've been a part
of hundreds

04:39.904 --> 04:41.656
of operations
during my career--

04:41.739 --> 04:43.157
and I'll tell you one thing.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.867
I never been on the top of
someone else's hit list.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.994
What are you
talking about?

04:46.077 --> 04:47.078
What am I
talking about?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.162
If this Company hit man Wyatt

04:48.246 --> 04:50.206
can find me once, it's
only a matter of time

04:50.290 --> 04:53.459
until he creeps up in the back
of my rear view mirror again.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.878
Well, that's not true.
'Cause you'll never see him coming at all

04:55.962 --> 04:57.046
if he's coming after you.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.132
That's comforting.
What do you think,

04:59.215 --> 05:00.258
I want that?

05:00.341 --> 05:02.552
You're dead, we're all back
in jail.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.054
You were an agent
longer than me.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.222
What's my play here?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.765
Okay.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.684
Let me get this straight.
You turn your back

05:09.767 --> 05:10.727
on me and now
you want to know

05:10.810 --> 05:12.395
my play? Really?!
That was your fault.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.147
What would you
have done?

05:21.821 --> 05:24.657
I've tracked down
rapists, killers,

05:24.741 --> 05:26.284
even former military,

05:26.367 --> 05:29.329
but a structural engineer from
Illinois was able to get to me.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.413
Want to know how?

05:30.496 --> 05:31.664
Yeah, I want to know.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.166
He stopped running.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.669
He got aggressive.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
He took the game to me.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.672
That's your play.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.300
That's your only play.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.896
I shouldn't have to remind you
that killing a federal agent

05:54.979 --> 05:57.982
is a complicated matter,
even in our line of work.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.277
Perhaps Mahone
is just

06:01.361 --> 06:03.446
the tip of the iceberg.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.906
We've been searching
for the link between

06:04.989 --> 06:07.700
SuperMax and Burrows
and Scofield.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.160
I believe we found it.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.579
If Scofield and Burrows
are working with the government,

06:11.662 --> 06:13.581
we've got a much
bigger problem

06:13.664 --> 06:15.958
than one bureaucrat
at Homeland Security.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.712
But it begins
with that bureaucrat.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.007
And if Don Self
is the head of the snake...

06:26.386 --> 06:27.845
Make it look like an accident.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.729
My fee just doubled,
by the way.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.143
Hello?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.769
Uh, hi, is this Brad?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.146
Yeah.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.731
Uh, you came by my office
a couple of days ago

07:20.815 --> 07:23.109
looking for a guy who had
an inheritance coming to him.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.777
Right.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.904
I know where he is.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.575
She wants two grand first.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.868
I'm meeting her at noon.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.994
Okay, the next card's more
important, right?

07:33.077 --> 07:35.037
So Vegas first, then
we deal with T-Bag.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.289
Shut up!

07:37.123 --> 07:38.666
I'll stay.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.711
All right.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.380
Linc, take, uh,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.257
Sara and Sucre...

07:47.175 --> 07:49.218
and Roland to Vegas.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.595
The rest of us...

07:51.804 --> 07:53.306
will handle T-Bag.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.309
You heard the man, let's go.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.149
Hey, um...

08:03.900 --> 08:05.902
promise me something,
would you?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
Yeah.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.656
Can you get me
Carrot Top's autograph?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.825
'Cause I just think

08:12.909 --> 08:14.702
that would make this
whole thing worthwhile.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.246
Be safe.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.923
Ay, yo, Vegas, bitches!

08:31.844 --> 08:33.846
He should have
the info by now.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.850
Okay, what the hell's taking
Bellick so long?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.770
Yes.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.146
She wants more money.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.189
How much more?

08:43.272 --> 08:45.858
I don't know.
You got to come talk to this chick.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.077
Hold on, hold on.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.706
What's going on, Bellick?

09:01.624 --> 09:04.293
Believe it.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.546
Sorry, guys, I walked right into it, too.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.630
Let's go. Go. Go!
Come on, now!

09:07.713 --> 09:09.131
Come on, tie them up.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.759
You have no idea who
you're working with, honey.

09:13.719 --> 09:14.929
Why don't we skip the theatrics

09:15.012 --> 09:16.472
and you just tell us
what you want.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.309
I'd love to put a hole right
in your head.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.770
Tie him up.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.564
Him, too.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.193
Let's all get in the van.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.280
Let's all get in the van now.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.700
You, too, Mahone.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.336
Mahone!

10:10.526 --> 10:12.278
I remember the day
we met, Pretty.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.990
You were a scared
little college boy

10:16.073 --> 10:17.783
sittin' up on
those bleachers,

10:18.784 --> 10:20.620
tryin' to keep your ass
out of the game.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.872
Now look at you.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.999
Cold. Hard.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.500
Like a dried up flower

10:26.584 --> 10:27.710
wanting to get watered.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.712
Just tell me what you want.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.006
I want to make you bleed.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.924
I want to release
the sinner inside of me

10:34.008 --> 10:37.303
that got me incarcerated
so many years ago.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.770
But it seems

10:45.853 --> 10:48.064
you caught yourself
a break, Pretty.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.649
I need you.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.192
Now...

10:52.109 --> 10:54.028
you gonna cooperate
right quick or so help me

10:54.111 --> 10:56.697
I'm gonna stomp you
till you can't stand.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.077
The pages... look at them.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.412
-Looks like some kind of map, right?
-I don't know.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.081
You know enough
to chase me down

11:05.164 --> 11:06.207
looking for this.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.375
Now don't lie to me, Pretty.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.127
Whatever's in that book--
it is bigger than you and me.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.171
What, like Scylla big?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.424
This is not a game, Theodore.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.135
Now, you need to tell
me who you've been talking to.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.187
I don't need

11:28.270 --> 11:29.230
to do a damn thing.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.276
That's the benefit of being
the man with the gun.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.447
Now...

11:38.531 --> 11:39.824
You're going
to write down everything

11:39.907 --> 11:42.451
you already know about Scylla,

11:42.535 --> 11:44.829
and everything

11:44.912 --> 11:47.039
you learn from that book...

11:51.669 --> 11:53.170
or I'm going to paint
these walls

11:53.254 --> 11:55.131
with your gray matter.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.304
Get to work!

12:46.640 --> 12:47.475
Hello.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.393
All right.
I'll be right there.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.030
Self.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.490
Hey. Michael's position

13:02.573 --> 13:03.616
hasn't changed since you called.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.742
How do we know he...?

13:04.825 --> 13:05.910
Bagwell's a psychopath,

13:05.993 --> 13:07.161
but he's a psychopath
with a plan.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.788
He obviously needs
something from Michael,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.664
and as long as Michael
doesn't give it to him,

13:10.748 --> 13:12.166
he'll keep breathing.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.667
All right.
I'm coming with you.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.544
No, no, no, no. I got it.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.921
Stick to the plan.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.899
Will you forget about Maricruz?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.025
You think she didn't know

13:38.108 --> 13:39.109
her sister was trying
to set you up, man?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.319
You better get some ass
in Vegas, bro.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.029
We're here
to copy the card.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.948
Then we leave. Got it?

13:48.702 --> 13:50.454
Have you heard from Michael?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.540
No. Why?

13:52.623 --> 13:54.708
Nothing.
I want this thing done.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.877
Vegas ain't my town.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.878
What a fool, huh?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.964
How could anyone not
love this place, right?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.969
Check this out.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.554
Right there.
The Asian guy.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.597
I know I've seen him
someplace before.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.874
So what do you have for me?

14:35.416 --> 14:36.542
So what's "GATE"?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.168
Excuse me?

14:38.252 --> 14:39.503
It's on that box.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.508
Why do you want to know?
Just curious.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.178
What if I was to tell you
I think you're just stalling?

14:48.262 --> 14:51.181
Biding time till you can
figure out some MacGyver way

14:51.265 --> 14:53.392
-to get your ass out of here, huh?
-I'd say you've got that gun

14:53.475 --> 14:55.185
pointed at the one
person who can help you.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.854
So why don't you
stop wasting my time?

15:05.696 --> 15:09.158
Ow! Please, don't let him!

15:09.241 --> 15:11.076
How 'bout her, huh?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.453
How 'bout her, Michael?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.538
Any reason why
I shouldn't kill her?

15:17.833 --> 15:19.209
Let's do a test.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.587
No!

15:24.089 --> 15:25.966
How far gone
is Michael Scofield?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.927
Michael, just tell him
what he wants!

15:28.010 --> 15:30.638
Please don't hurt me.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.557
How far gone
is Michael Scofield?!

15:33.641 --> 15:35.726
Please,
don't let him. Please!

15:37.645 --> 15:39.563
When did it happen, Michael?

15:40.898 --> 15:43.651
When did you stop caring
about hurting people, huh?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.611
Fox River? Sona?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.363
You gonna keep dragging

15:47.446 --> 15:49.114
your feet while I put a bullet
in her brain?

15:49.198 --> 15:51.325
Why don't you put that gun down.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.203
I'll put it down when you start
writing down, Pretty!

15:54.286 --> 15:55.955
T-Bag come on man,
let her go.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.498
Last chance. Three!

15:57.581 --> 15:58.666
Two! One...

15:58.749 --> 16:00.250
All right! All right!

16:06.465 --> 16:09.259
The pages,
they fit together.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.428
But it's not a map.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.848
It's a blueprint.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.767
For what?

16:38.622 --> 16:39.540
Our friend, Bellick, is wearing

16:39.623 --> 16:41.333
a government-issued
ankle monitor.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.794
My guess is that
Scofield has one, too.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.090
I knew that son of a bitch
was slow-walking me.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.842
Any minute,
federal agents could come

16:49.925 --> 16:52.219
blasting through
that door.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.679
So what do we do?

16:53.762 --> 16:57.141
I need you to get the make and
serial number of that monitor.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.851
Feel free to pitch in here,
Miss Daisy.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.478
If Scofield knows I'm involved,
this is over.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.730
We need to keep him on point.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.773
Now, get out there
and get that information.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.528
What about the agents?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.613
Let 'em come.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.810
How do we even know
this guy's out gambling?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.480
The guy's got $300,000
in credit and a comped room.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.606
He's here.
Keep looking.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.316
Hey, Sara.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.651
Hey, uh, I realize this might
not be the best time for this,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.111
but I still haven't heard
from Michael.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.488
They must be
dealing with T-Bag.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.782
Lincoln, come on.
What?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.325
Vegas just isn't your town?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.451
From everything
I've heard about you,

17:57.534 --> 17:59.620
that would be a pretty big
change of pace.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.121
I guess so.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.208
Lincoln, please talk to me.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.627
Has Michael told you
about Mom?

18:06.710 --> 18:07.961
No.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.129
They were much alike.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.298
They got the same mind.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.301
As Mom got older,
she started to lose it.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.761
We, uh,
later found out

18:15.844 --> 18:18.680
it was a symptom
of a brain tumor, hama...

18:18.764 --> 18:20.099
Hamartoma.
Yeah.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.851
As a kid,
she got nosebleeds.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.103
They stopped.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
In her thirties, they
started up again.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.316
She-- She later died of
a brain aneurysm.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.819
And you're telling me this,
because Michael and his mother

18:31.902 --> 18:33.529
are similar in that way,
too, right?

18:33.612 --> 18:36.615
He got nosebleeds
as a kid.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.867
They stopped, and the
last couple of days

18:38.951 --> 18:39.910
they started up again.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.997
How old was your mom
when she passed away?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.415
Thirty-one.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.877
Michael's just
turned thirty one.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.175
Yeah?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.510
I found him.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.137
Keep an eye on him.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.513
Okay.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.342
Andrew Blauner?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.594
Uh, yeah.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.013
Can I help you?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.556
I hope so.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.774
Any boyfriends or roommates
I should know about?

20:34.858 --> 20:35.943
No.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.947
Any deliveries
scheduled for today?

20:40.656 --> 20:41.698
No.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.207
I'm giving you one more...

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
What is all this?

20:57.673 --> 20:58.715
You okay?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.262
They told me
not to talk to you.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.100
"They"? Who's they?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.102
This is Whistler's blueprint.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.354
It's the building
where we can find Scylla.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.606
In other words,
it's GATE.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.568
Where's Scylla?

21:18.652 --> 21:21.071
I can't be certain until I see
the building itself,

21:21.154 --> 21:24.283
but I'm pretty sure it's
somewhere down here, below this office.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.535
What is Scylla?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.870
It's The Company's
little black book.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.290
I want you to take me
to GATE, now.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.047
Because you can smell
that Scylla money, can't you?

21:40.799 --> 21:43.385
That's what you're in
it for, just like me.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.931
Say it.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.641
Come on.

21:49.725 --> 21:50.851
I want you to say it.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
I'm in it for the money.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.237
You see?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.700
We ain't so
different after all.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.670
Yes?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.839
Don Self is not at his house.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.800
Looks like he cleared out.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.678
Notify our people
inside the Bureau and LAPD.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.225
I doubt that he could have
gotten very far.

23:14.059 --> 23:14.935
Sir?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.019
Not now.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.355
Don Self is here
to see you.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.669
Got to warn you, friend,
she's cold.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.811
Good luck, pal.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.944
Stay with him.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.087
Scofield's really
getting somewhere in there.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.422
Man works fast.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.548
Says he can't
get any further

24:26.631 --> 24:28.550
without seeing my former place
of employment.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.678
Did you take care
of our little troll problem?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.602
Don't even think
about doing this to me.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.061
My name's on the door.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.521
If I didn't think
you were valuable,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.231
you'd be dead already.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.153
Grab a leg.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.033
It's-It's just a little sensory
overload, guys.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.576
There just wasn't any room
for the card.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.036
Right. Because if we
turn the device on

24:56.119 --> 24:58.830
in the casino, it fills up
on all the data from the slots.

24:58.914 --> 24:59.789
Yeah.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.084
Like when they're
about to pay out.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.504
-Oh, it's completely unintentional.
-Really?

25:05.587 --> 25:06.671
-Yeah.
-It's not why you built

25:06.755 --> 25:07.923
the damn thing in the first place?

25:08.798 --> 25:10.050
If we didn't need you...

25:10.133 --> 25:13.345
But you do, so just take
a brewski and chill, all right?

25:13.428 --> 25:16.139
Okay, we need to figure out
a way to get Scuderi alone.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.644
Yeah.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.604
The old man just showed up
at the pool.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.689
From what he's wearing,
there's no way

25:24.773 --> 25:25.690
he's got the card on him.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.025
Stay with him.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.028
Card's in his room.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.787
Tell me, Donald,

25:38.870 --> 25:41.456
how did you play this
moment out in your head?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.000
Did you picture yourself
coming in here,

25:44.084 --> 25:46.378
chest out,
jaw squared,

25:46.461 --> 25:47.796
ready to demand answers?

25:47.879 --> 25:51.007
Did you at any time
in your fantasy

25:51.091 --> 25:54.219
imagine that you
would be this nervous?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.014
Honestly, I, uh...
I didn't think much past

25:58.098 --> 25:59.307
giving you these.

26:05.021 --> 26:08.525
Berlin. Nigeria.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.902
The Comrie Group.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.446
Why not JFK

26:13.530 --> 26:15.657
and the Lindbergh baby
while you're at it?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.950
Son,

26:17.033 --> 26:18.618
those matters
have been fully vetted.

26:18.702 --> 26:19.995
They're relics.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.664
I had nothing
to do with them, and if

26:22.747 --> 26:24.374
this is why you've
been pulling data on me,

26:24.457 --> 26:26.459
I could have saved you
a lot of trouble.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.044
Okay. Well, these records

26:28.128 --> 26:30.005
and a sealed letter
explaining my investigation

26:30.088 --> 26:32.007
into your involvement
with these matters

26:32.090 --> 26:33.341
was sent to five lawyers

26:33.425 --> 26:34.509
across the country.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.719
If anything
happens to me,

26:35.802 --> 26:39.180
if I go missing, anything,
if I wind up dead,

26:39.264 --> 26:40.640
that letter is
to be unsealed...

26:40.724 --> 26:44.561
And they will find cold trails
that lead nowhere near me.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.645
It doesn't matter.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.771
If a government agent

26:46.855 --> 26:48.648
who was looking into you
is found floating

26:48.732 --> 26:51.192
in the L.A. River, or whatever
else you have planned,

26:51.276 --> 26:53.361
your life, General,
will change dramatically.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.032
There will be questions, media coverage
and surveillance,

26:57.115 --> 26:59.868
and whatever you and the Company
are trying to do next

26:59.951 --> 27:00.994
with your little Laos game,

27:01.077 --> 27:02.579
or whatever else
you have planned,

27:02.662 --> 27:05.498
it'll be next to impossible
with thousands of eyes on you.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.167
Okay? So back off of me.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.295
You are not

27:10.378 --> 27:12.380
the first person
to attempt something

27:12.464 --> 27:13.715
like this.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.885
Most of the others I now fondly call
my colleagues.

27:17.802 --> 27:18.970
They've learned to put

27:19.054 --> 27:22.307
their determination and focus
to better use,

27:22.390 --> 27:25.143
and with far greater
compensation.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.936
Wrong guy.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.064
We'll see.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.567
"Dear Mr. White,
due to unforeseen circumstances,

27:32.651 --> 27:35.487
"I regret to inform you
that I will no longer be able

27:35.570 --> 27:36.863
"to perform services at GATE.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.281
"I thank you
for this opportunity.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.449
"I'm deeply sorry

27:39.532 --> 27:41.326
"if this places you in
a difficult position.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.245
"I have simply not been able
to escape these circumstances.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.289
Thank you for the wonderful,
enriching opportunity..."

27:47.499 --> 27:49.250
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.669
Does it sound like you?

27:52.045 --> 27:53.129
Yeah.

27:53.713 --> 27:54.839
Good.
Yeah.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.092
Look,

27:57.175 --> 27:59.135
I don't even know
who you are, okay?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.512
Just let me go...

28:00.595 --> 28:01.680
Shut up.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.725
And you wondered

28:05.809 --> 28:09.604
how I got to be the top salesman
in the northeast region.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.648
Sorry, okay?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.068
Sorry.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.612
Consider this a warning.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.173
Old Teddy Bagwell

28:37.257 --> 28:38.633
may be Coosa County trash,

28:38.717 --> 28:41.052
but Cole Pfeiffer's a man
of refinement.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.596
One of the Gate Corporation's

28:43.680 --> 28:45.932
tippy-top sellers,
as a matter of fact.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.186
Step into my office.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.277
Well, there should be a room,
eight by ten.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.654
Whistler's point of entry.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.822
That's a closet.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.075
No, it's not.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.881
Hi. Tonic and lime, please.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.800
Thank you.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.469
I'm in the middle
of this nightmare.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.762
I wonder if you
could help me.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.096
Uh...

29:27.015 --> 29:29.934
It's my twenty two year old
cousin's bachelorette party.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.021
That's hardly
the salt mines.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.314
Oh, wait for it.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.065
There's a scavenger hunt,

29:37.275 --> 29:38.902
and my team has tasked me

29:38.985 --> 29:42.113
with getting a photograph
in a whale's suite.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.157
I'm a whale?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.243
With a very
scary bodyguard

29:47.327 --> 29:49.078
and a very gorgeous watch.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.956
And you want to take
a picture in my room?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.209
And I realize it's a completely
inappropriate request,

29:54.292 --> 29:57.170
but they're already
calling me a wet blanket.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.298
I'm sorry.
I just can't help you.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.510
What if I said "please"?

30:03.593 --> 30:05.303
I'm actually
a little desperate.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.222
Best of luck.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.478
Drinks are on
the gentleman.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.355
Have a nice day.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.981
You, too.

30:20.777 --> 30:21.778
Don't take it personally.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.029
You're not his type.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.615
Right before
you sat down,

30:25.698 --> 30:28.284
he asked me if
I liked to party.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.746
Absolutely not!
No way!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.164
Bro, come on.
Take one for the team.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.416
Maricruz will never know.
I'm gonna snap his neck.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.293
Get to his room, stay two
minutes, then leave, all right?

30:37.377 --> 30:39.712
Yeah, yeah, and in the meantime,
what? In the elevator?

30:39.796 --> 30:41.422
Just play hard to get, you know,
and then let him nuzzle

30:41.506 --> 30:42.465
a little bit.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.968
Hey, whoa!
What option we got?

30:45.051 --> 30:46.636
Come on, man.
What option we got?

30:46.719 --> 30:48.471
Give me one.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.890
You can't. Here.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.946
Go ahead.
There's nothing back there.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.991
I know.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.344
Do we have anything sharp?

31:39.397 --> 31:42.901
So, what are you hearing, uh,
Scylla is worth, huh?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.822
Me, I'm hearing millions.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.578
Is that a rough ballpark

31:53.661 --> 31:56.789
in terms of what you, uh...
what you've been told?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.059
What do we have here?

32:19.145 --> 32:20.355
You'd better back up.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.264
You and me and
a dark hole.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.685
Just like old
times, Pretty.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.813
You first.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.620
How are the chips
falling for you?

34:01.664 --> 34:03.124
Spent my last buck
on the beer.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.795
What are the options when
you're broke in Vegas?

34:10.798 --> 34:12.383
I guess I got
to work that out, huh?

34:15.845 --> 34:17.722
What if you
didn't have to?

34:18.681 --> 34:20.224
I may have a
little business

34:20.308 --> 34:21.601
to throw your way.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.812
What kind?

34:30.151 --> 34:31.652
The easy kind...

34:33.279 --> 34:34.906
with a $1,000 payout.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.034
What's your cognac?

34:39.535 --> 34:41.871
I've never had it.

34:41.954 --> 34:44.665
I've got a 200-year-old
bottle in my suite.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.460
Join me.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.170
This is
private business.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.048
Between men.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.856
They're on their way up.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.233
Get ready.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.985
I love it.
Mr. Macho Man.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.203
Well, well, well.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.374
What's next?

35:26.457 --> 35:28.292
I don't know, why
don't you figure it out?

35:28.376 --> 35:29.877
I'm done helping you.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.589
Sounds like someone's caught

35:33.673 --> 35:34.799
in the old captivity
of negativity.

35:34.882 --> 35:38.136
Let's get you in a more
affirmative mindset.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.262
What's next?

35:40.596 --> 35:43.683
I think I'm gonna lock
you in this room.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.393
And then, you're
gonna be arrested

35:45.476 --> 35:47.186
and taken back to Fox River.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.232
Just how do you plan on...

36:01.033 --> 36:03.119
Stop, y'all have no idea
what you're doing.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.872
Scofield, you can't
do this without me.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.123
Self's on his way.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.249
Mark my words!

36:08.332 --> 36:09.500
Got your message.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.252
Y'all have no idea

36:11.335 --> 36:12.420
what you're doing!

36:12.503 --> 36:14.297
Thanks, Alex.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.387
Great city.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.805
I guess so.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.224
That's the thing
about Vegas.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.934
Doesn't judge you.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.521
Any form of pleasure
is acceptable here.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.737
Ahhh.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.283
Am I crazy, or is there
a note of plum in there?

36:45.286 --> 36:47.288
M-maybe.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.789
Have a seat.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.335
Did you serve?

36:52.418 --> 36:53.669
Serve who?

36:54.587 --> 36:55.796
In the military.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.091
You look like a Devil Dog.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.220
No, sir, I've never been
in the service before.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.517
Filling up nice.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.229
Sucre must be
in close proximity.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.147
Getting oiled, most likely.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.821
One and half
tours in Vietnam.

37:22.323 --> 37:23.282
Purple Heart

37:23.366 --> 37:26.535
in a friendly fire
exchange near Hue.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.704
Sorry to hear it.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.007
What I learned at Hue,

37:41.342 --> 37:44.971
though valuable...
also cost me

37:45.054 --> 37:46.055
a great deal.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.892
Specifically...

37:49.976 --> 37:52.728
three square inches of
upper groin thigh meat.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.023
And with that...

37:57.858 --> 38:00.194
my reproductive
and sexual function.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.993
So... so you can't...

38:07.076 --> 38:10.746
Mr. Villalobos, I'd like
you to meet my wife.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.458
I'm Alexa.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.588
You want me to
bang your wife?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.467
And I'm gonna
pay you $1,000.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.364
He's got a minute.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.490
Then I'm going after him.

38:48.617 --> 38:49.577
Did it copy the card?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.162
Yep.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.663
All right, download that.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.207
You got five minutes.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.627
Well?

38:58.711 --> 39:00.296
His wife was up there.

39:00.379 --> 39:01.797
And...?

39:03.299 --> 39:04.884
It stays in Vegas.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.102
Uh, hey, guys.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.645
I'm gonna go hit the head,
and I'll be out

39:16.729 --> 39:18.105
in a minute, all right?

39:28.783 --> 39:30.201
Yes!

39:32.620 --> 39:35.289
Two... two... two pulls.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.749
All right.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.752
Two spins.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.548
Come on.

39:49.136 --> 39:50.304
There he is.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.139
Two pulls, and he won
the progressive.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.851
Where the hell is he?

39:55.935 --> 39:57.645
I'll go get him.

40:11.826 --> 40:12.910
Mr. Glenn.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.161
We got a problem.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.748
It was made clear
you were never again welcome

40:17.832 --> 40:19.250
in any Nevada
gaming establishment.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.877
Wait, wait, uh, I was told
there was only a five-year...

40:21.961 --> 40:23.838
No such thing
was said to you.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.508
What's that do?
It's a battery pack

40:27.591 --> 40:29.009
for a video game console.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.849
You'll need
to buy a new one.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.024
I already downloaded the
card onto my laptop,

40:44.108 --> 40:47.153
and... and I can build
another device.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.737
You said this one
takes months.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.989
We don't have months.
You know what?

40:50.072 --> 40:53.117
We ought to leave your ass
in the desert.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.536
Let's get him back to L.A.,
and let Self sort him out.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.871
Let's go.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.275
For a little guy, he
has some set of lungs.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.652
-How's Bellick and the girl?
-All taken care of.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.696
I'm gonna keep T-Bag
in protective custody

41:30.779 --> 41:32.823
until we get Scylla-- then,
I'm gonna make somebody

41:32.907 --> 41:35.117
at Illinois's DOC
very, very happy.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.243
But more importantly,

41:36.327 --> 41:37.703
what the hell is that
room downstairs?

41:37.786 --> 41:38.787
That's not where they keep
the device

41:38.871 --> 41:40.247
that decodes Scylla, is it?

41:40.331 --> 41:41.665
No.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.334
That's just what
T-Bag thought.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.628
The road to Scylla
only begins down there.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.422
This is the room
where we've got T-Bag now.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.424
Just past the
south wall,

41:50.508 --> 41:52.176
there's an access
tunnel that runs

41:52.259 --> 41:53.469
for about 300
yards or so.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.095
We get through that,
we're in.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.555
That's where we
can decode Scylla.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.933
And this is the building where
General Krantz's office is.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.018
- There you go.
- I was there today, but I have to tell you,

42:01.101 --> 42:02.603
the security in that place
is unbelievable.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.564
And according to the blueprints,
the substructure is completely exposed.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.900
It shouldn't take more than twenty four
hours to get in there.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.360
It's only gonna
take twenty four hours?

42:09.443 --> 42:12.279
All we have to do
is get that last card first.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.617
Well, based on what
I've deciphered so far,

42:16.700 --> 42:19.036
we're gonna need
around-the-clock access to GATE,

42:19.119 --> 42:20.329
starting immediately.

42:20.412 --> 42:22.456
If you can get us
some suits and IDs,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.250
we could go in there
as IRS agents

42:24.333 --> 42:25.417
auditing the books--
I mean, considering

42:25.501 --> 42:27.336
the kind of racket
they're running,

42:27.419 --> 42:28.837
nobody would have a problem
believing that.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.172
Can you make that happen?

42:30.256 --> 42:31.632
Yeah, I could do it.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.516
It's under the can.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.355
Hello?

42:46.438 --> 42:47.815
We have a lot in common.

42:47.898 --> 42:49.149
Yeah, who is this?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.402
Just another interested
party in what you're up to.

42:52.611 --> 42:53.946
Yeah, what's that?

42:54.029 --> 42:55.114
Scylla.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.615
Open the envelope.

42:59.827 --> 43:00.786
The pages I've got

43:00.869 --> 43:01.996
only go up to seventy seven.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.831
Is this more blueprint?

43:03.914 --> 43:05.332
I don't know.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.751
What do you want?

43:07.835 --> 43:09.253
I don't know what you've done

43:09.336 --> 43:10.462
with Bagwell,
but unless I see him,

43:10.546 --> 43:12.756
you're not getting
the rest of the pages.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.841
Is that right?

43:13.924 --> 43:14.925
Give me that.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.510
Who is this?

43:17.678 --> 43:19.013
Hello, Michael.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.014
Captioned by Point.360
