00:00.200 --> 00:02.700
[Julie] Your Honor,
this is a medical support dog.

00:02.767 --> 00:06.967
[Judge Judy] So, he damaged the gate
which you have to have fixed?

00:07.433 --> 00:09.100
Yes.

00:09.166 --> 00:12.500
He made sixteen cuts,
eight in the front.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.600
- Not true.
- Oh, my God.

00:14.667 --> 00:18.400
You don't look like you need
an emotional support dog for anything.

All rise. Court come to order.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.867
Be seated, please.

00:53.367 --> 00:56.266
Hello, Judge.
Case 1044, Mondin vs. Lucas.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.333
Thank you.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.667
Ms. Mondin, I've read your papers,

00:59.734 --> 01:03.367
and I don't see anything in your papers
involving the dog,

01:03.433 --> 01:04.967
so can you tell me why the dog is here?

01:05.033 --> 01:08.400
Your Honor, this is a medical support dog.

01:08.467 --> 01:12.033
Um, sometimes when I don't eat enough
sodium or glucose,

01:12.100 --> 01:16.200
then I faint or, you know,
have a medical emergency.

01:16.266 --> 01:21.133
So, she's trained to detect blood sugar
and blood pressure.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.300
Okay. This is the case which
doesn't appear to be too difficult.

01:26.767 --> 01:31.500
You hired the defendant
to do some iron work at your home.

01:31.567 --> 01:35.967
You wanted some decorative work done
on your iron gate.

01:36.033 --> 01:38.767
From what I read in your papers,

01:38.834 --> 01:41.500
the defendant had done work for you
previously,

01:41.567 --> 01:44.967
which you were satisfied with
and paid him for.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.300
- If I may, Your Honor.
- It's either a yes or a no.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.100
Had he done work for you previously?

01:50.166 --> 01:51.734
Only on the gate, so yes.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.100
So the answer is he had done work for you
previously that you were satisfied with?

01:56.166 --> 01:57.600
- [Julie] Yes.
- And you paid him?

01:57.767 --> 02:01.000
- Yes.
- And then for this particular job,

02:01.066 --> 02:03.633
you wanted to add some decorative stuff.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.000
And first give me a timeframe,
month and year.

02:08.066 --> 02:10.133
Beginning of October,
October 9th, 2020.

02:11.266 --> 02:14.367
[Judge Judy] Did you call him
or did you text him about this job?

02:14.433 --> 02:15.734
How did you reach out to him?

02:15.800 --> 02:18.033
I found him on Craigslist
as a welder. I texted him--

02:18.100 --> 02:19.100
[Judge Judy] Well, that was--

02:21.734 --> 02:24.400
he had done work for you before,

02:24.467 --> 02:26.066
so you must have had his number.

02:27.033 --> 02:31.333
No. He did work for me
before the day we had this kerfuffle,

02:31.400 --> 02:32.867
but he only did work on the gate.

02:32.934 --> 02:34.133
The gate was a project.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.367
Ms. Mondin...

02:36.667 --> 02:38.734
when did he first go to your house?

02:38.800 --> 02:42.600
What month and year,
to work on the gate?

02:42.667 --> 02:44.300
September, 2020.

02:44.367 --> 02:47.033
Okay. And he did work on the gate...

02:47.100 --> 02:48.600
- [Julie] Yes.
- ...in September.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.066
And what did he charge you in September?

02:51.133 --> 02:53.367
Between $400 a day on one day,

02:53.433 --> 02:55.333
$450 a day on another day.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.066
So he came on two separate occasions

02:59.133 --> 03:03.233
between September and October 9th?

03:03.300 --> 03:08.934
On two separate occasions,
one $400 and the other one for 450?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.800
And a third time also.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.266
- And he came a third time?
- Yes.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.533
And how much was that?

03:13.600 --> 03:16.200
I would have to look, I think it was $420.

03:16.266 --> 03:19.600
Okay. And he did work
on the gate and you paid him?

03:19.667 --> 03:23.233
- Yes.
- And did you pay him by check or cash?

03:23.300 --> 03:27.233
Check one time,
and then he requested cash only,

03:27.300 --> 03:28.700
cash the rest of the times.

03:28.767 --> 03:33.800
So, the last two times
he worked for you, he requested cash?

03:33.867 --> 03:36.033
- Yes.
- Then on October 9th,

03:36.100 --> 03:40.533
you reached out to him again
to do additional work.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.600
And my question was,
did you reach out to him again

03:43.667 --> 03:47.400
by phone or by text on October 9th?

03:47.467 --> 03:50.100
Or did you tell him on a previous day,

03:50.166 --> 03:52.367
"Come back, I want you to do more work?"

03:52.934 --> 03:55.300
Previous day, we were texting.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.367
Okay. Do you have a copy of the texts

03:57.433 --> 04:01.867
where you made an agreement
to pay him $500 to do that work?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.500
I have a receipt, Your Honor,
but I don't think I have that.

04:05.567 --> 04:08.567
He would always give me
a receipt the day of.

04:08.633 --> 04:13.800
Okay. But he had to have told you
what the cost was, that's a contract.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.834
Right. I have three previous invoices,

04:16.900 --> 04:19.800
and he would write the invoice
when he got there, not before.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.667
Okay. Did he write
an invoice on October 9th?

04:22.734 --> 04:23.800
He did not.

04:23.867 --> 04:27.100
Okay. Did he tell you
on October 9th what the cost would be?

04:27.166 --> 04:28.400
- Yes. And I--
- Wait just a second.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.467
Okay.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.567
And what did he tell you
the cost would be?

04:31.633 --> 04:33.133
$450.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.266
And on October 9th,

04:35.333 --> 04:39.333
did he complete the job
that he was supposed to?

04:39.400 --> 04:42.467
- Yes.
- And on October 9th,

04:42.533 --> 04:46.133
you had a conversation with him
after the job was completed,

04:46.200 --> 04:49.133
according to you and according to him,

04:49.200 --> 04:53.633
that you didn't have money
that day to pay him?

04:53.700 --> 04:55.333
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.000
And you told him that
after he had finished the day's work?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.400
- No.
- When did you tell him that?

05:01.467 --> 05:02.633
Before he finished.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.133
I was just getting ready to pay him.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.467
It was around to 4:30, 4:15.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.834
Well, you were just getting
ready to pay him with what?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.166
Cash.

05:10.233 --> 05:11.433
Now, that's not what you said...

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
- Well...
- ...Ms. Mondin.

05:12.567 --> 05:13.834
[Julie] I asked him if he had PayPal

05:13.900 --> 05:17.734
because I didn't have enough cash on hand.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.166
I never said I wasn't going to pay him.
I said I didn't have enough cash.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.100
No, no, I--no.

05:22.266 --> 05:24.867
You had previously paid him in cash.

05:24.934 --> 05:26.266
Yes.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.900
And on the 9th of October,

05:28.967 --> 05:32.066
you said, "Do you have PayPal?

05:32.133 --> 05:34.867
- I don't have cash." That's what...
- Right. Yes.

05:34.934 --> 05:35.934
- Okay.
- Yes.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.500
- And he said no, he doesn't have PayPal.
- Right.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.600
- Correct?
- Correct.

05:41.667 --> 05:42.667
- Okay.
- Not true, but...

05:42.734 --> 05:44.133
- Sure.
- Okay.

05:45.066 --> 05:47.166
Well, you know, I actually understand

05:47.233 --> 05:49.433
that you think that that
may be peculiar, Ms. Mondin.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.633
I don't have PayPal.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.800
I don't know what it is.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.233
I don't understand that whole thing.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.066
Money flies through the air,
through the airwaves,

05:56.133 --> 05:57.133
I don't understand it.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.000
I understand it when you go into a bank,
you fill out a withdrawal slip,

06:01.066 --> 06:03.934
you give it to a teller,
the teller gives you money,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.100
and you leave the bank.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.767
That--

06:06.834 --> 06:07.967
- I get it.
- That's what I understand.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.100
I get it.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.767
I also did other work
at her house as well, so...

06:11.834 --> 06:13.333
Not before the gate.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
- Just a second...
- [Martin] I haven't been to your house...

06:14.467 --> 06:16.533
You made--just shh.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.233
If you talk to each other,
you don't need me.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.600
- Okay.
- Then I won't have a job.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.767
Then they won't have a job.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.100
You know,
I actually understand that you think that

06:44.166 --> 06:45.700
that may be peculiar, Ms. Mondin.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.100
I don't have PayPal.
I don't know what it is.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.500
I don't understand that whole thing.

06:49.567 --> 06:52.100
Money flies through the air,

06:52.166 --> 06:53.333
I don't understand it.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.133
I understand it when you go into a bank,
you fill out a withdrawal slip,

06:57.200 --> 07:00.066
you give it to a teller,
the teller gives you money,

07:00.133 --> 07:03.066
and you leave the bank. That...

07:03.133 --> 07:04.700
- [Julie] I get it. I get it.
- That's what I understand.

07:04.767 --> 07:07.667
You know, I don't understand
putting your phone up next to something

07:07.734 --> 07:12.567
and people have been paid
or clicking an orange, the store,

07:12.633 --> 07:18.200
and somehow the merchant gets paid
for that orange and you just leave.

07:18.934 --> 07:21.033
One day I will figure it out,

07:21.100 --> 07:25.233
or one of my children or grandchildren
will try to explain it to me

07:25.300 --> 07:26.834
so I actually do understand it.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.867
- But he doesn't have PayPal.
- [Julie] No.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.600
- And he wanted to get paid.
- [Julie] Yes.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.934
So there was a kerfuffle.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.500
And during the kerfuffle,
Mr. Lucas acknowledges

07:37.567 --> 07:42.100
that he took off the work
that he did that day

07:42.166 --> 07:43.333
- and it is your--
- [Martin] Okay.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.266
Shh. Just a second. And it is your--

07:45.333 --> 07:49.266
it is your claim that in doing so,

07:49.333 --> 07:53.033
he damaged the fence or the gate?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
The gate.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.533
The gate,
which you have to have fixed.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.133
Mr. Lucas says that actually
what you said to him was,

08:00.200 --> 08:03.100
"I don't have money today,"

08:03.166 --> 08:06.266
and you had somewhat of a hissy fit

08:06.333 --> 08:08.266
because you expected to be paid.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.300
You couldn't find the keys to your truck,
according to you,

08:11.367 --> 08:14.233
and you sat around her house for a while.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.166
[Martin]
Waiting for the locksmith, yeah.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.800
- For your truck?
- [Martin] Yep.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.667
And according to you--

08:20.734 --> 08:22.166
Because it mysteriously disappeared.

08:22.233 --> 08:27.834
According to you,
Ms. Mondin left, came back,

08:27.900 --> 08:33.133
and she handed you $200 in cash

08:33.200 --> 08:35.467
- that she says she got from her sister.
- Friend.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.066
- A friend.
- Neighbor.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.233
And a $300 gift card.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.200
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:42.266 --> 08:44.433
And you accepted?

08:44.500 --> 08:45.867
- I did.
- But you--just a second.

08:45.934 --> 08:49.533
You accepted the $200 in cash

08:49.600 --> 08:52.800
and the $300 gift card.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.033
You accepted it.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.900
And furthermore, Mr. Lucas,

08:57.967 --> 09:00.767
you say in your answer that

09:00.834 --> 09:04.734
you couldn't sell the $300 gift card
for $300.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.133
You said you took a lot less for it
in order to get cash.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.033
Let me see if I remember
exactly what you said.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.600
"Even though that was not
what we agreed upon,

09:14.667 --> 09:16.600
I reluctantly accepted.

09:16.667 --> 09:21.900
I then had to sell the gift card
for half the amount it was worth

09:21.967 --> 09:23.200
so I could get cash."

09:23.266 --> 09:25.967
- That's what you wrote in your answer.
- Yep.

09:26.033 --> 09:30.233
So, not only did you accept it as payment,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.000
so that you're not owed any money anymore.

09:32.066 --> 09:36.600
I mean, you could have said to her,
"I'm not taking the $300 gift card.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.800
I'll take the $200 down payment,
but in cash,

09:39.867 --> 09:42.667
but I'm not taking the $300 gift card,"
but you accepted it.

09:42.734 --> 09:46.300
And not only did you accept it,
you disposed of it for money.

09:46.367 --> 09:48.166
You've been fully paid.

09:48.233 --> 09:51.100
Now, I would like to know, Mr. Lucas,

09:51.166 --> 09:54.233
at what point did you--

09:54.300 --> 09:55.667
according to you, 'cause you did in fact

09:55.734 --> 09:57.400
take something off the gate.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.800
- What did you take off the gate?
- Okay.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.834
After you finished working, and after...

10:02.900 --> 10:04.633
I have not been paid yet.

10:04.700 --> 10:08.066
She didn't offer to pay me with PayPal.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.500
- She told me that she had...
- Okay. But...

10:09.567 --> 10:13.867
...was expecting her unemployment.
And it hadn't come in...

10:13.934 --> 10:15.800
Just a second. Don't say anything.

10:15.867 --> 10:19.033
And it hadn't come in,
and that she couldn't pay me today.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.100
- Okay.
- Now...

10:20.166 --> 10:23.133
Oh, I got it. I want to know at what point

10:23.200 --> 10:25.667
and what exactly did you do to the gate?

10:25.734 --> 10:29.633
So after she told me that,
she, you know, I'm like,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.533
"Okay. I don't wanna deal with it.
I'm packing up my tools."

10:32.600 --> 10:34.767
And probably about 15 minutes
after that conversation,

10:34.834 --> 10:36.300
I went over and removed a--

10:36.367 --> 10:38.834
I guess it's like an ornament
that was on the gate.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.233
It was welded in four spots.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.800
It took me five minutes to do

10:41.867 --> 10:45.367
and probably fifteen minutes
to put it back on.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.734
Just a second.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.166
Tell me exactly what you did
without diminishing what you did.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.166
So, you went over to the gate, she left.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.767
You went over to the gate
because you were waiting for a locksmith

10:56.834 --> 10:59.166
because you couldn't find the keys
to your truck.

10:59.233 --> 11:03.000
You went back to the gate
and took off an ornament.

11:03.066 --> 11:04.467
- Yeah. With the assumption of...
- No, no.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.834
...and understanding that
I wasn't getting paid today.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.200
- No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
- Yeah.

11:08.266 --> 11:10.166
You took off an ornament.

11:10.233 --> 11:11.767
- Yes, I did.
- Okay.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.967
Do you have a photograph of what you did?

11:15.033 --> 11:17.200
- I think she does.
- Well, I know she does.

11:17.266 --> 11:18.734
I'm asking you if you do.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.367
- I--no, I don't.
- Okay.

11:20.433 --> 11:25.000
May I see the photographs
of what Ms. Mondin says that...

11:25.066 --> 11:26.066
Okay. This is the top.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.333
...the defendant did to the gate?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.834
This is the top where he did it.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.567
I also have on text messages...

11:30.633 --> 11:32.066
Just a second.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.467
Just a second.
Let me--can I look?

11:33.533 --> 11:36.100
- Okay.
- Just for--I'm a very simple person.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.767
I can only do one thing at a time.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.700
[Julie] Cuts, cuts.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.934
He made 16 cuts.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.567
- Eight in the front--
- Just a second, Ms. Mondin.

11:48.767 --> 11:52.400
You don't have a picture
of what was there, is that right?

11:52.467 --> 11:54.300
You mean the finished gate
before he damaged it?

11:54.367 --> 11:55.367
- Yes.
- I do not.

11:55.433 --> 11:56.433
Okay.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.700
- This is a picture of the gate.
- Yes.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.000
- As it is today?
- Yes.

12:04.066 --> 12:05.266
Okay.

12:05.734 --> 12:08.300
- Did you have it fixed?
- Not yet.

12:08.367 --> 12:10.767
Would you make circles around?

12:11.333 --> 12:13.900
So I know that you have marks here.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.667
- Right.
- Make circles around that picture

12:18.400 --> 12:20.266
to see what she's talking about.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.233
Was there a bar across?

12:22.300 --> 12:23.533
There's a frame.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.200
So, yes, there was a bar on the sides,
the top, and the bottom, and in between.

12:27.266 --> 12:29.200
Is that what he took off?

12:29.266 --> 12:31.166
- No.
- What did he take off?

12:31.233 --> 12:36.500
In order to put those decorative
flower ornaments on

12:36.567 --> 12:40.166
in under the frame so that they hang on
to the frame and they stay,

12:40.233 --> 12:44.934
you have to--as far as I know,
take a piece of iron or metal

12:45.000 --> 12:47.133
and weld that closed

12:47.200 --> 12:50.967
so that the frame is attached
to those flowery decorative parts.

12:51.033 --> 12:53.500
Is this the only gate that he worked on?

12:53.567 --> 12:55.133
Yes.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.000
And so far, you've spent over
a thousand dollars

12:59.066 --> 13:01.633
on doing one thing
or another to this gate?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.467
I paid him to build the gate.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.867
Not repair a gate.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.300
We built that gate from scratch.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.600
I designed it, he helped.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.667
I see.

13:08.734 --> 13:10.967
I also did other work
at her house as well.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.300
- So...
- Oh.

13:12.367 --> 13:13.667
Yeah. Because this looks--

13:13.734 --> 13:17.200
- Not before the gate.
- Just a second.

13:17.266 --> 13:18.266
I haven't been to your house
since after gate.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.333
Shh!

13:20.266 --> 13:22.467
If you talk to each other,
you don't need me.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.400
- Okay.
- Then I won't have a job.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.100
Then they won't have a job.

13:29.367 --> 13:33.700
So what you said to him
on December 3rd was inaccurate.

13:33.767 --> 13:36.967
You said I have had it repaired today.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.400
I anticipated that it would be done.

13:38.467 --> 13:39.567
- Just a second.
- Yeah.

13:39.633 --> 13:41.433
- That was inaccurate.
- That was inaccurate, Your Honor.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.633
Okey-dokey.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.767
[♪ theme music playing]

13:52.767 --> 13:55.934
[announcer] <i>Julie Mondin</i>
<i>has accused welder Martin Lucas</i>

13:56.000 --> 13:58.166
<i>of damaging her iron gate.</i>

13:58.233 --> 14:02.767
<i>Martin claims Julie broke their agreement</i>
<i>by not paying him with cash.</i>

14:02.834 --> 14:06.467
Over a thousand dollars on doing
one thing or another to this gate?

14:06.533 --> 14:09.800
I paid him to build the gate.
Not repair a gate.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.433
We built that gate from scratch.
I designed it, he helped.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.700
I see.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.367
I also did other work
at her house as well. So...

14:16.433 --> 14:18.567
Oh. Yeah. Because this looks--

14:18.633 --> 14:21.266
- Not before the gate.
- Just a second. You may just...

14:21.333 --> 14:23.200
I haven't been to your house
since after gate.

14:23.266 --> 14:24.266
Shh!

14:25.100 --> 14:27.467
If you talk to each other,
you don't need me.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.567
- Okay.
- Then I won't have a job.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.934
Then they won't have a job.

14:33.533 --> 14:36.367
Okay. The bottom line is
you can't go and do this.

14:36.433 --> 14:38.633
You can't cut anything off at all.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.834
- No.
- You can't do anything...

14:39.900 --> 14:42.333
- No.
- Which clearly was done here.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.333
You couldn't do what you've accepted
payment, you were paid.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.500
And whether it was before or during,
if you had left in your truck,

14:48.567 --> 14:50.433
if you could find your keys,
you would have left

14:50.500 --> 14:52.500
if you didn't, you were frustrated.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.900
She left, but then in fact
you accepted payment.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.500
So that's a no-no on your part.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.400
- Correct. I understand.
- Um, that's a no-no.

14:58.467 --> 15:04.200
So do you have an estimate
to fix the gate?

15:12.734 --> 15:14.600
May I ask you a question, your Honor.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.400
- [Judge Judy] Yes.
- Is that for $200?

15:17.467 --> 15:19.333
No, it's $780.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.433
[Martin] Okay. 'Cause I have right here
a text message from her

15:22.500 --> 15:25.033
saying, "Martin, please pay me back
the sum of $200

15:25.100 --> 15:28.166
for the vandalism damage you did
to my garden gate."

15:28.233 --> 15:31.100
[Judge Judy]
May I see it? May I see that?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.734
[Martin] Originally, she asked for $250,
and then she came down to $200.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.700
- Your Honor...
- Just a second.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.500
Okay. You can take this back.

15:48.266 --> 15:51.100
November and December,
what you asked him for...

15:51.166 --> 15:52.233
[Julie grunts]

15:52.300 --> 15:54.266
...what you asked him for...

15:55.367 --> 15:59.567
was $250, half of the day's pay.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.333
- Yes.
- And he said,

16:01.400 --> 16:04.066
"I'll take care of it
a week from tomorrow."

16:04.133 --> 16:05.900
And then you wrote him again and said,

16:05.967 --> 16:09.800
"Please pay me back the sum
of $200 for the vandalism.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.900
Since you promised to come and fix it

16:11.967 --> 16:14.600
but then never showed up
or communicated back,

16:14.667 --> 16:17.667
I have had it repaired today."

16:17.734 --> 16:19.066
That's December 3rd.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.467
But that's not true,

16:20.533 --> 16:23.633
- because that estimate, that proposal...
- [Julie] Right.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.433
...that you just gave me was dated July...

16:27.500 --> 16:28.700
- Correct.
- ...29th.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.567
So you said,
"Since you promised to come and fix it,

16:31.633 --> 16:33.767
but never showed up, I had it repaired."

16:33.834 --> 16:35.367
- Well, that was in December.
- Right.

16:35.433 --> 16:38.800
So what are you giving me
a proposal for, for $780 now?

16:38.867 --> 16:42.033
Okay. The guy who was
going to repair it that day

16:42.100 --> 16:43.500
showed up and couldn't do it.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.834
And I sent the text--

16:44.900 --> 16:48.834
All right. Well then show me
the texts subsequently.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.400
- Okay. All right.
- Show me

16:50.467 --> 16:52.567
subsequently to him
where you say I have...

16:52.633 --> 16:54.867
- Yes. Okay. Here. Yeah.
- ...a new proposal? Yeah.

16:54.934 --> 16:56.767
- "I have had it repaired today."
- [Martin] Yes.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.100
- So what...
- [Julie] Right.

16:58.166 --> 16:59.767
So what you've--just a second.

16:59.834 --> 17:04.367
So what you said to him
on December 3rd was inaccurate.

17:04.433 --> 17:07.533
You said, "I have had it repaired today."

17:07.600 --> 17:09.934
- I anticipated that it would be done--
- Just a second.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.233
- Yeah.
- That was inaccurate.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.200
- [Julie] That was inaccurate, Your Honor.
- Okey-dokey.

17:20.133 --> 17:23.300
Yeah. This says, "I'll be happy to come by
and remedy any issues." He never did?

17:23.367 --> 17:26.200
He never did and he never--
he stood me up.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.333
He said, "I'll be there
a week from Saturday."

17:28.400 --> 17:31.467
I've called him.
I can prove I called him, uh, like...

17:31.533 --> 17:32.700
- Yes, you did.
- [Julie] ...um, 10 days ago.

17:32.767 --> 17:33.767
- He never answered...
- [Martin] Yes, you did.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.166
And you left me irrational messages
and it's-- I'll be honest with you...

17:36.233 --> 17:37.433
- I did leave voicemails.
- [Judge Judy] Just a second.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.700
It made me nervous to go to your house.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.433
- Oh, my go...
- Shh.

17:41.567 --> 17:45.333
Your actions today demonstrate
you can't control yourself,

17:45.400 --> 17:46.600
- is what I'm telling you.
- Okay.

17:46.667 --> 17:47.867
- That's what it--that's...
- All right.

17:47.934 --> 17:52.033
So, if you have high blood pressure,
I would take a chill pill

17:52.100 --> 17:56.867
'cause I have high blood pressure,
and, and I don't get excited, ever.

17:56.934 --> 18:00.233
Mr. Lucas, you owe her $780.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.734
That's what her proposal is

18:01.800 --> 18:04.834
to fix the damage that you did
cutting through the iron gates.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.633
You can't have a hissy fit
on somebody else's property

18:07.700 --> 18:09.834
and then accept payment for it,

18:09.900 --> 18:11.233
which you did, you got paid.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.867
So you're gonna have
to give it back to her.

18:12.934 --> 18:16.000
And she says that
she didn't have the gate fixed.

18:16.066 --> 18:19.734
She's got a proposal
from what looks like a reputable company

18:19.800 --> 18:23.367
that said that it's gonna cost
$780 to repair what you did.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.700
You can't do that.
Do you understand?

18:25.767 --> 18:27.700
Judgment for the plaintiff, $780.
We're done.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.467
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- [Kevin] Court is adjourned.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.066
Well, Judge Judy is harsh,
but she is fair.

18:34.133 --> 18:38.033
Well, I just don't think that
the judge really understood

18:38.100 --> 18:40.200
the dynamics of what happened that day.

18:40.266 --> 18:45.033
Typical kind of shyster contractor guy,
preys on single women.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.333
I showed up to go to work that day

18:47.400 --> 18:49.934
and worked an entire
eight-and-a-half-hour day.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.600
I never said I can't pay you today.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.233
I said I can't give you cash.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.900
And then when it came time
to get paid that day,

18:55.967 --> 18:57.500
she said she didn't have any money.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.533
I didn't say I didn't have money.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.100
I said I didn't have cash.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.900
I basically went over and I undid
a portion of the work that I did

19:04.967 --> 19:06.300
thinking that I wasn't getting paid.

19:06.367 --> 19:09.967
I thought that our transactions were fair
and no one was taken advantage of,

19:10.033 --> 19:12.800
but when he, like,
flipped his lid and went ballistic...

19:12.867 --> 19:15.600
$780, it was literally four welds.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.800
And so I would go with a big company--

19:17.867 --> 19:20.066
Honestly, um,
she's just a little irrational.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.467
I didn't trust her to pay me.

19:21.533 --> 19:24.400
I'm not good with, like, a single guy
who's tattooed everywhere

19:24.467 --> 19:26.033
and brings his pit bull to work.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.567
Way too high-strung.
Way too high-strung.

19:28.633 --> 19:29.800
It was the right decision.

19:29.867 --> 19:30.967
I hope I never see her again.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.266
Are there any circumstances
where somebody providing a service

19:35.333 --> 19:37.734
could forcibly remove their work,

19:37.800 --> 19:39.367
like the defendant did here

19:39.433 --> 19:42.000
if they're not paid
for what they were supposed to do?

19:42.066 --> 19:43.300
Interesting question.

19:43.367 --> 19:47.700
I don't think that
you are allowed to vandalize

19:47.767 --> 19:50.100
a property for non-payment.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.333
I think that that's what courts are for.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.333
I mean, if you take it
to the illogical degree,

19:56.400 --> 19:59.133
if you're a construction firm

19:59.200 --> 20:04.066
that provided cranes for a skyscraper,

20:04.133 --> 20:08.000
and the owner of the skyscraper
failed to pay a bill,

20:08.066 --> 20:10.600
you can't go in there
and knock down the building

20:10.667 --> 20:14.533
and say this building was made
in part because of my efforts.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.867
I understand his frustration.

20:16.934 --> 20:18.367
He was accustomed to being paid.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.800
She had always paid him,
and here he is halfway finished.

20:20.867 --> 20:25.166
He's worked an, you know,
an eight-hour day doing iron welding.

20:25.233 --> 20:28.667
And she comes out and says,
"Oh, by the way, I don't have any money"

20:28.734 --> 20:30.567
and then takes off.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.433
So I understand his frustration.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.533
But you can't vandalize
somebody's property.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.200
You have to get a new truck, go home,

20:38.266 --> 20:40.266
go to small claims court,
take out a summons,

20:40.333 --> 20:41.934
but he accepted payment.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.834
He could have rejected the payments.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.433
I'm not accepting this payment.
But he did.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.000
But during that period of hissy fit,

20:49.066 --> 20:52.200
he did vandalize her property,
and he can't do that.

20:54.633 --> 20:55.834
