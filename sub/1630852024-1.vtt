WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:06.093
There's a town that exists
at the borderlands.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.009
A place of nightmares
and dreamscapes.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.272
A place where folklore and myth

00:11.315 --> 00:14.623
carry the weight of fact
and truth.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.234
A place where superstition
and their laws

00:17.278 --> 00:19.584
overshadow the laws of science,

00:19.628 --> 00:22.631
and a place where
old traditions die hard,

00:22.674 --> 00:24.372
if they die at all.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.895
The name of this place

00:26.939 --> 00:29.377
is Rivervale.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.032
And though it might
seem familiar to you,

00:32.075 --> 00:34.338
like a town you visited before,
I can assure you,

00:34.382 --> 00:37.080
it is not that same town.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.300
Don't worry,
I'll show you around.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.954
First stop,
Toni and Fangs' apartment,

00:41.998 --> 00:43.913
portrait of a couple
in distress.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.307
Baby Anthony finally
fell asleep?

00:46.350 --> 00:49.049
More like he passed out
from exhaustion.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.094
He can't keep going
like this, Fangs.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.531
He's literally crying 24/7.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.185
Something's wrong.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.406
We'll call Doc Curdle,
get Anthony an appointment.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.364
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.850
Ah...

01:07.893 --> 01:10.026
There she is,
Miss Tabitha Tate.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.768
And that is
our real estate agent.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.726
And if I'm not mistaken,
those are our...

01:14.770 --> 01:16.163
Here are your keys.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.252
Thank you, Ms. Gordon.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.992
We are so excited.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.603
Uh-huh.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.779
So, is this your first time
living with a beau?

01:23.822 --> 01:25.868
Actually, yes.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.262
I've never taken
that step before.

01:28.305 --> 01:31.352
I have always been too guarded,
I guess.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.570
Too nervous.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.137
Of course.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.444
This day and age,
you can't be too careful.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.537
Let's check in with Rivervale's
premier power couple,

01:42.580 --> 01:44.713
Reggie Mantle
and Veronica Lodge.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.932
I'm sorry, Mr. Banks,
but if you hesitate,

01:46.976 --> 01:49.587
I can't guarantee
this opportunity
will be here tomorrow.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.764
You'd be getting in
on the ground floor
of a gold mine, Mr. Lance.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.114
Yes, that is correct.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.724
A casino right here
in Rivervale.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.598
[chuckles]
Exhausting, aren't they?

02:00.642 --> 02:03.035
Let's head over to Elm Street.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.735
The Cooper house,
where Alice is doing
a lot better,

02:06.778 --> 02:10.478
but her appliances,
not so much.

02:10.521 --> 02:13.089
Well... [sighs]
that should clear that up.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.004
What was it, Frank?
More chicken bones?

02:15.047 --> 02:17.615
No, not this time.
It was a, um,

02:17.659 --> 02:19.530
dish rag.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.924
Hey, I have quiche in the oven.
Would you stay for breakfast?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.406
[exhales]

02:25.449 --> 02:28.670
Tempting,
but let's go next door.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.020
Where my old chum
Archie Andrews

02:31.063 --> 02:34.545
is living with my ex-girlfriend
Betty Cooper.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.069
Let that one sink in
for a minute.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.290
And while we're all
good friends, I should probably
end the tour here

02:40.334 --> 02:44.207
and leave whatever is happening
upstairs to your imaginations.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.993
[ticking]

02:48.907 --> 02:50.082
[explosion]

02:51.475 --> 02:52.824
-[Archie gasping]
-Arch.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.481
You okay?
Was it another nightmare?

02:57.525 --> 02:59.701
-Yeah. Sorry I woke you.
-No, it's okay.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.530
Was it a bad one?

03:04.053 --> 03:05.359
It was surreal.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.928
We were talking up here
in my room,

03:09.972 --> 03:12.235
and we heard this
ticking noise.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.802
Mmm-hmm.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.717
It was a bomb under the bed.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.937
Oh, my God. That's awful.

03:18.981 --> 03:24.029
Yeah, the weirdest part,
we were living in a town
called Riverdale.

03:24.073 --> 03:29.209
-Riverdale with a "D."
-Yeah.

03:29.252 --> 03:33.169
Okay. No more Twilight Zone
marathons before bed, okay?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.650
[both chuckle]

03:35.693 --> 03:39.610
Let's make all those bad dreams
go away with some
early morning delight.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.968
[phone ringing]

03:52.101 --> 03:53.494
[Betty sighing]

03:59.021 --> 03:59.978
Kev, what's going on?

04:03.721 --> 04:04.809
Where are you?

04:04.853 --> 04:06.115
I was jogging when I found it.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.422
[Archie] Whoa.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.948
The way the deer's
laid out looks...

04:14.819 --> 04:17.257
ritualistic,
like it was sacrificed.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.437
And its blood was used
to draw these runic symbols
all over the stone.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.308
Who would do that?

04:25.352 --> 04:28.572
I don't know,
but whoever did
took the deer's heart.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.096
Okay, uh, never gonna
jog here again.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.447
Nor should you, interloper.

04:33.490 --> 04:37.668
You merry three are trespassing
on the sacred sovereign nation
of Thornhill.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.583
Be gone from
its borders immediately,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.498
or else my pupils
will shoot you full of arrows.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.848
-Like who, girls?
-St. Sebastian.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.111
Mistress Blossom.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.549
Cheryl, this is a crime scene
so I need to collect
all of the evidence,

04:48.592 --> 04:49.854
including the deer.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.595
You will do
nothing of the sort.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.293
My girls and I will assume
possession of that carcass.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.598
To do what?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.252
We will make a stew
from its meat,

04:56.296 --> 04:57.949
a pelt from its hide
and a paste from its hooves.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.211
That's a little barbaric.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.997
No, you sad, simple, she-child.

05:03.607 --> 05:07.089
It's a part of a sacred circle
of life and death,

05:07.132 --> 05:10.222
of use, reuse and rebirth,

05:10.266 --> 05:13.878
of paying respect
to what the Earth gives us,

05:13.922 --> 05:16.185
all of what she gives us.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.755
Now leave my land, heathens.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.106
Girls.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.067
Toodles.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.777
I'm afraid Baby Anthony
has colic.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.256
Colic?

05:44.300 --> 05:47.434
It's quite common
and can last indefinitely.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.698
There might be gas
in his intestines
causing the discomfort--

05:50.741 --> 05:52.395
What can we do, Doc?

05:52.439 --> 05:55.006
Because he's crying 24/7.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.095
It's agony for all of us.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.836
I do know
of an old folk remedy.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.973
I'd like to put this toad
in Baby Anthony's mouth.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.627
It'll suck the colic
right out of him,

06:07.323 --> 06:08.237
absorb it.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.196
No more crying.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.938
I'm sorry,
but there's no chance in hell

06:13.982 --> 06:18.421
I'm letting you put
a frickin' frog
in my baby's mouth.

06:18.465 --> 06:22.686
In that case, the only other
recommendation I can make
is ear plugs.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.997
How many more boxes
of comic books do you have?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.216
Oh, it's just a fraction.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.175
The rest is still in storage.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.611
You know, to be honest
with you, Jug,

06:34.655 --> 06:36.439
I didn't know
you were that into comics.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.876
Well, what can I say, Archie?
I contain multitudes.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.790
Come on.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.227
[exhales]

06:42.271 --> 06:44.447
I really appreciate
your help, Betty.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.231
I hope you don't feel weird
being here.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.495
No, not at all.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.106
Honestly, I'm very happy
that you and Jughead are taking
this step together.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.978
Meanwhile,
what about you and Archie?

06:54.022 --> 06:56.024
Are you all in?

06:56.067 --> 06:58.113
It's really weird, Tabitha.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.158
Back in high school,
one of the biggest questions
in my life was...

07:01.986 --> 07:04.641
"Am I going to end up
with Archie or Jughead?"

07:04.685 --> 07:08.732
And now it seems like we have
a definitive answer.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.086
Today's your lucky day,
Cameron.

07:15.130 --> 07:20.788
I'm wondering if you
or any of your boys want
to invest in a boutique casino

07:20.831 --> 07:22.703
a colleague and I
are opening up in Rivervale.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.053
So this is what
you've been up to, Veronica.

07:25.096 --> 07:28.535
As usual, the she-wolf
is making lemonade
out of lemons.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.450
I don't even know
what that means, Cameron.

07:30.493 --> 07:33.496
This casino or whatever
is obviously a distraction

07:33.540 --> 07:36.804
till you come back to New York,
where you belong.

07:36.847 --> 07:40.242
As usual, Cameron,
you're totally wrong
about everything.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.984
I'm all in on the casino
and Rivervale.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.773
Tell me straight, Ronnie.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.514
Do you want this casino or not?

07:51.558 --> 07:52.994
Of course I do.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.910
Ignore Cameron. He's an idiot.

07:55.953 --> 08:00.001
So it's just not another
stopgap till you
get your old job back?

08:00.044 --> 08:04.745
Reggie, I did want to go back
to Wall Street initially.

08:04.788 --> 08:07.399
But now...

08:07.443 --> 08:10.490
I'm having a ball
doing this with you.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.318
And I think our casino
is gonna be huge.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.366
Everything happens
for a reason, lover.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.763
Everything that's meant to be
finally is.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.723
[Tabitha screams]

08:26.767 --> 08:28.986
Jughead, spider!
Spider, Jughead!

08:30.771 --> 08:33.295
No, no, no!
Jughead, Jughead, don't!
[groans]

08:33.338 --> 08:35.515
Oh, my God, Jughead.
I didn't want you to kill it!

08:35.558 --> 08:37.821
I wanted you to put in a cup
and take it outside.
You never kill a spider.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.344
It's bad luck.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.521
[chuckles] Come on,
that's just superstition.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.524
Maybe so, but we just
moved in together,

08:44.567 --> 08:46.830
and I don't want anything
to jinx us.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.963
Tabitha.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.531
It's just an itsy-bitsy spider.
What's the worse
that's gonna happen?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.445
It's not like we're cursed now.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.622
[ominous music playing]

08:58.407 --> 09:01.279
And next on the agenda,
we have an update,

09:01.323 --> 09:03.717
on the town's
reforestation plans.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.631
Archie Andrews.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.285
Thanks, Toni.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.461
Yeah, basically,
we're good to go.

09:09.505 --> 09:13.030
As you may know,
since Cheryl declared
Thornhill a sovereign state,

09:13.074 --> 09:15.467
we've lost our local supply
of maple syrup

09:15.511 --> 09:17.644
as well as the revenue
that the syrup was bringing in.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.603
-Aren't our trees already
tapped out anyway?
-They are, Tom.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.344
Which is why I propose

09:22.387 --> 09:25.477
we buy and distribute
maple saplings.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.655
One per family to be planted
in each family's yard.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.745
My crew and I will take point
on seeding a grove
of maple trees

09:31.788 --> 09:33.094
that the town will own.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.661
And have we secured
the saplings?

09:34.704 --> 09:36.532
We just got
the shipment in, Alice.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.881
And as we discussed,
Frank and I
will be setting up

09:37.925 --> 09:39.448
a distribution center
outside of Pop's.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.277
[crowd murmuring]

09:44.453 --> 09:45.280
Hmm.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.414
Riveting.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.548
You might find the discussion
underway at Thornhill,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.029
also about maple syrup,
more interesting.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.425
[clears throat]

10:02.906 --> 10:04.560
Today,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.867
before we came upon
those intruders in my forest,

10:06.910 --> 10:09.957
I was pointing out
our precious maple trees,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.961
how dry and lifeless
they have become.

10:14.004 --> 10:17.965
I believe our maple groves
have withered away because

10:18.008 --> 10:20.881
we have forgotten the old ways.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.535
Ah, the old ways.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.277
Before we built our first
settlement in Rivervale,

10:26.321 --> 10:30.238
when this area was just land
and river and rocks,

10:31.195 --> 10:33.458
it all belonged to her.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.373
She who walks amongst
the trees.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.289
We worshipped her.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.857
We gave offerings to her.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.686
And she provided.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.036
Maple sap, yes,

10:46.080 --> 10:51.651
but also life
in all its beautiful,
glorious facets.

10:53.130 --> 10:56.960
Over time,
we left the old ways behind.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.354
We started taking
the Maple Maiden for granted,

10:59.397 --> 11:03.532
and she, in turn, punished us.

11:05.360 --> 11:10.408
All that was once fecund
is now barren.

11:10.452 --> 11:14.325
We must again
pay tribute to her,
like our ancestors once did.

11:14.369 --> 11:18.721
We must return to
the old ways, the blood ways,
the pagan ways,

11:18.765 --> 11:21.724
and by hoof and by horn, girls,
return we shall.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.510
But first,

11:25.554 --> 11:27.948
we have to go
into town tomorrow.

11:27.991 --> 11:32.082
My spies have told me
that Archie Andrews is trying
to steal my maple thunder.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.216
And that simply will not do.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.000
[dramatic music playing]

11:45.705 --> 11:47.402
Yes, Mom. I promise.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.364
Okay, yeah. I love you too.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.583
All right, bye.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.064
Hey.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.153
How's your mom?

11:59.196 --> 12:01.242
Honestly? Yeah, she's good.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.548
She says hi. And, uh...

12:03.592 --> 12:07.422
She's wondering if we've put
any more thought
into what she asked

12:07.465 --> 12:08.510
last time she was here.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.122
Arch.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.777
I thought we decided
that marriage wasn't for us

12:14.821 --> 12:17.171
because everyone we know
who's married

12:17.214 --> 12:19.042
is either divorced or dead.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.652
No, totally.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.697
She was actually asking
about the other thing.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.223
The "when am I going to have
a grandkid" thing.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.445
And what did you say?

12:30.488 --> 12:32.360
I told her if it were up to me,

12:32.403 --> 12:34.797
-I would want it to happen
sooner rather than later.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.190
I mean, my dad was a young dad.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.148
Arch, for the record,

12:38.192 --> 12:40.324
I've been dreaming
about starting a family
with you since...

12:40.847 --> 12:41.848
Mmm...

12:42.587 --> 12:43.980
Sixth grade.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.289
But let's just take our time.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.770
There's no rush,
we're in our twenties.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.597
Okay, so let's just keep
doing our thing

12:52.641 --> 12:54.469
and let nature run its course.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.079
-Yeah.
-Like right now.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.254
[Betty giggles]

13:07.134 --> 13:08.048
Ooh!

13:08.091 --> 13:09.266
[plate clattering]

13:12.879 --> 13:14.184
[motor whirring]

13:17.622 --> 13:19.537
Shades of Creepshow.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.844
One per household,
plant them in your yard.

13:21.888 --> 13:25.021
Make sure there's enough space
for their roots to grow wide
and deep, okay?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.768
Well, well, well.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.989
So it is true you are making
a play for my maple birthright
and empire.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.601
Cheryl, you don't own
maple trees or maple syrup,
for that matter.

13:39.644 --> 13:43.300
I believe every citizen
of Rivervale should be able
to tap their own tree.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.477
Then I'd like
13 saplings, please.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.175
That way we can plant them
in the Thornhill groves,

13:48.218 --> 13:49.567
and they can grow
in the shadow

13:49.611 --> 13:51.874
of she who walks amongst
the trees.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.442
You seceded, remember?

13:54.485 --> 13:57.532
These saplings are reserved
for taxpaying citizens

13:57.575 --> 14:01.318
of Rivervale to be planted
in Rivervale.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.408
-Unless you want to rejoin
our ranks?
-Rejoin Rivervale?

14:04.452 --> 14:06.976
After you tried to erase
the sins this town
has perpetrated

14:07.020 --> 14:10.414
against my ancestor,
Abigail Blossom?

14:10.458 --> 14:14.505
You and I both know
there is only one way
that will ever happen.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.898
Over your dead body.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.771
No, Archie. Over yours.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.860
Come along, girls.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.257
I'm afraid, Miss Cooper,
that the test
came back conclusive.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.739
You don't seem to be
producing any viable eggs.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.611
It will be difficult for you
to conceive a child.

14:36.963 --> 14:37.920
Oh, my God.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.273
If it's any consolation,
you're not alone
in this dilemma.

14:43.317 --> 14:47.277
No, actually,
it's not a consolation,
but what are you talking about?

14:47.321 --> 14:51.978
You're the fifth young,
healthy woman to come see me
who is essentially

14:53.544 --> 14:54.415
barren.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.681
[Anthony crying]

15:05.208 --> 15:07.210
[sighs] Look.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.952
I know if we pick up
Baby Anthony,
it'll validate his crying.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.649
But this is torture.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.870
I was talking to my grandma
about Anthony's colic.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.481
She said back in the day,
serpent mothers would leave

15:17.525 --> 15:20.963
their crying babies
on tree stumps
in Fox Forest overnight.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.226
They just left their babies
in the woods?

15:23.270 --> 15:25.272
[chuckles] Yes.

15:25.315 --> 15:28.231
And when the mothers
went back in the morning,

15:28.275 --> 15:29.493
the babies were sleeping
peacefully.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.626
They'd cried the colic out.

15:31.669 --> 15:34.281
There's no way a serpent mother
would abandon her baby
like that.

15:34.324 --> 15:38.241
Well, apparently,
my mom did it to me.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.766
It worked.

15:41.810 --> 15:45.422
Leaving Baby Anthony
in the woods
would toughen him up.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.468
Just like his mama.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.862
Reginald.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.168
Will you come with me, please?

15:58.522 --> 15:59.784
Surprise!

16:01.090 --> 16:03.266
[Veronica chuckles]

16:03.310 --> 16:06.313
In case you're worried
that I don't appreciate you,

16:06.356 --> 16:09.272
here is cold, hard proof
that I do value you.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.058
Your bonus, sir.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.147
And not only that,

16:14.190 --> 16:17.106
there's one thing
I fantasized about doing,

16:17.150 --> 16:18.499
but never have.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.287
I've always wanted to make it
on a bed full of money.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.898
[seductive music playing]

16:40.564 --> 16:42.697
Bratwurst was delicious
as usual, Alice.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.352
Thank you, Frank.
It's one of my go-to recipes.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.182
Well, I should probably
head back home.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.053
Archie and I have a big day
of planting tomorrow.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.968
[chuckles] Frank.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.579
It's the same thing every time.
I make you a delicious meal,

16:55.623 --> 16:57.320
and you sprint for the door.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.021
So I'm going to make this
plain as day for you.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.980
I like you, Frank Andrews.

17:06.677 --> 17:10.986
I find you very attractive.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.076
And I would like for you
to stay the night with me.

17:15.773 --> 17:16.731
In my bed.

17:19.429 --> 17:22.215
Wow, I am
very flattered, Alice.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.869
You're such a beautiful woman.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.178
-But I just...
-You just what?

17:30.397 --> 17:31.311
I just, um...

17:34.836 --> 17:37.012
can't go there.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.277
Wow. I don't believe it.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.280
When will I ever learn?

17:44.324 --> 17:46.891
I fall for the strong,
silent type every time.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.423
I've been thinking.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.864
What if we adopted a baby?

18:10.001 --> 18:10.915
Betty.

18:14.223 --> 18:17.574
My dad always used to tell me

18:17.618 --> 18:20.360
that the most fulfilling thing
that he ever did
was become a father.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.798
And I want to do that with you,

18:23.841 --> 18:25.408
every step of the process.

18:27.845 --> 18:28.672
Arch.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.982
You need to believe me
when I tell you...

18:36.593 --> 18:39.857
there's nothing more
that I want
than to have your baby.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.470
Not just for you, but for me.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.254
I love you

18:46.777 --> 18:47.952
so much.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.000
I want to create a life
with you.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.309
I want to be the mother
of your child,

18:56.352 --> 18:57.571
our child.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.790
Then you will.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.185
It'll happen.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.797
[Anthony crying]

19:21.464 --> 19:22.900
Bon soir,Antoinette.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.079
Cheryl,
what are you doing here?

19:28.123 --> 19:29.951
Just taking in some night air.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.345
What are you doing
with that little bundle
of babe?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.869
It's a long story. I'm just

19:34.912 --> 19:36.349
trying to cure his colic.

19:37.045 --> 19:37.959
I see.

19:40.875 --> 19:41.832
May I?

19:45.271 --> 19:46.141
Okay.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.623
[Anthony stops crying]

19:53.322 --> 19:55.194
How did you do that?

19:55.237 --> 19:57.544
It must be the calming perfume
I concocted in my greenhouse.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.502
The ingredients of which

19:59.546 --> 20:01.852
I could mix into a more
permanent solution
for his colic.

20:01.896 --> 20:05.247
But then you must help me
embrace Rivervale's
oldest of old things.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.858
Fine. Just tell me what to do.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.251
Not much.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.906
I just need you to bear
witness and then,

20:11.949 --> 20:13.908
per tradition,

20:13.951 --> 20:15.214
everything will be
as it should.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.868
[Tabitha screams]

20:17.912 --> 20:19.957
Hey, hey, hey.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.916
-What's going on?
-Do you not feel them?

20:21.959 --> 20:24.266
-Feel what?
-Something is biting me.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.703
You seriously not feel like
you're being eaten alive?

20:26.747 --> 20:27.617
No.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.707
[Tabitha panting]

20:30.751 --> 20:33.144
I'm not seeing any
critters in the bed.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.930
Or on us.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.541
Hey.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.980
I was having a nightmare
about spiders.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.636
And then it felt like
the spiders were biting me.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.986
Okay, well that's what it is.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.553
You're just having a dream.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.600
There's no spiders.
These sheets are fresh.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.558
I just got them brand new.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.168
You're okay. You're okay.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.127
[exhales]

20:59.170 --> 21:00.563
Come here.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.956
[breathing heavily]

21:07.657 --> 21:09.877
Jug, don't think I'm crazy,
but can you check out...

21:11.008 --> 21:13.446
Oh, my God! Your back.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.622
Your back is covered
in welts, bites.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.015
Same as my arms and legs.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.235
I was literally just about
to ask you to check them out.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.412
I told you we were being
eaten alive,
probably by bedbugs.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.632
-Well, we checked the sheets--
-Okay, well, then it's scabies,

21:25.675 --> 21:26.981
which you can't see
with the naked eye,

21:27.024 --> 21:28.722
but they are vicious
blood suckers.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.854
Okay, we'll wash the sheets
with hot water and bleach.

21:30.898 --> 21:31.942
Are you kidding?

21:31.986 --> 21:32.726
That's not gonna do anything.

21:32.769 --> 21:33.901
We're infested.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.032
I'm calling an exterminator.

21:35.859 --> 21:36.947
Ugh.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.477
All right.
It's time for arts and crafts.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.262
Take some twine and fabric
from the basket
and pass it along.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.265
Today we are making poppets
to honor the Maple Maiden.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.962
Are the poppets to play with?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.225
No, Britta. They serve
a myriad of purposes,

21:54.269 --> 21:57.403
but these ones
will be a warning.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.630
[Archie] What in the hell?

22:10.677 --> 22:14.245
This is Cheryl, 101.
It's got to be.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.335
Let's dig these things
out and make room
for the saplings.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.727
You sure you want
to do that, Arch?

22:17.771 --> 22:18.685
[Archie] Positive.

22:19.773 --> 22:20.948
Double time, boys.

22:29.130 --> 22:29.957
Hey.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.307
How'd the planting go?

22:34.353 --> 22:35.310
I know that look.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.399
What's wrong?

22:40.271 --> 22:41.882
Cheryl.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.625
She impaled these dolls
all over the forest

22:45.668 --> 22:47.366
where we were going to
plant our saplings.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.020
She did? Why?

22:51.457 --> 22:54.198
To spook my crew.

22:54.242 --> 22:57.550
Which she did, by the way.
They were anxious all day long.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.029
That's so bizarre.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.554
I feel like I've seen

23:01.597 --> 23:03.556
-one of these before.
-Where?

23:03.599 --> 23:06.254
I've been sorting through
old evidence boxes
at the FBI office,

23:06.297 --> 23:10.171
and I feel like there was
a cold case with totems
like this one.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.346
Can I borrow this?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.348
-Knock yourself out.
-Okay.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.305
See you later.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.533
Well, Reginald,
what do you think?

23:24.577 --> 23:27.144
These are
the finalized blueprints
for our casino.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.756
Exquisite, no?

23:29.799 --> 23:31.801
And the best part is

23:31.845 --> 23:34.978
you and I are going to christen
every square inch
of this place.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.855
Well, that's a first.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.334
Question for you, Ronnie.

23:43.378 --> 23:46.425
If the casino was my idea,
which it was,

23:46.468 --> 23:50.994
and we'd be equal partners,
then how come you forgot
to give me an office?

23:53.649 --> 23:54.650
Shoot.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.306
That's a good question, um...

23:58.349 --> 24:00.482
You know,
let me just call the architect

24:00.526 --> 24:03.267
and I'll have them
redraw the plans.
It won't be an issue.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.182
Too late.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.271
A picture's worth
a thousand words, Ronnie.

24:10.927 --> 24:11.972
[sighs]

24:12.015 --> 24:14.017
[cell phone ringing]

24:17.673 --> 24:19.675
-Kev, what's up?
-[sighs] I came back
to the forest

24:19.719 --> 24:21.721
because I forgot my shovel
and the saplings...

24:21.764 --> 24:24.071
-Archie...
-What about them?

24:24.114 --> 24:26.029
[sighs] Someone ripped them out
of the ground.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.378
They're all destroyed.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.732
What do you think
you're doing, Cheryl?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.560
Archie, calm down.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.387
I know you and your girls
left those dolls
for us to find.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.173
-And did you rip up
our saplings too?
-Why would I,

24:39.216 --> 24:43.046
keeper of the Maple Flame,
murder innocent,
nascent maple saplings?

24:43.090 --> 24:45.701
Because you can't stand
the fact there might one day
be a time

24:45.745 --> 24:48.922
when Rivervale isn't dependent
on your family for maple syrup.

24:48.965 --> 24:49.879
You're out of line, Archie.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.794
If I may enlighten you,

24:51.838 --> 24:54.493
I requested this
audience of the four
to offer an olive branch,

24:54.536 --> 24:57.974
specifically to invite
the entire town of Rivervale
to Thornhill

24:58.018 --> 25:00.368
for a good old-fashioned
maple festival.

25:00.411 --> 25:03.632
And just so you know,
Archie, we, the council

25:03.676 --> 25:08.071
have accepted
Cheryl's invitation
on behalf of the entire town.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.682
-We'll all be there.
-[Cheryl sighs]

25:13.381 --> 25:14.382
[exhales]

25:40.800 --> 25:41.714
RB.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.850
Rose Blossom.

25:52.376 --> 25:53.377
[door opens]

25:55.423 --> 25:56.685
[Cheryl] Cousin.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.905
How for did you get
into my house?

25:58.948 --> 26:00.602
A bobby pin.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.735
But I'm actually here
on official FBI business

26:02.778 --> 26:05.564
regarding that deer
you killed in the woods.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.741
Really, you and Archie
are just too much.
I mean, I get it.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.743
I'd be obsessed with me too.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.658
But what makes you think
I had a hand
in that dreadful business?

26:12.701 --> 26:14.834
So, let me put it this way.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.707
That deer was not the first
blood sacrifice
on Thornhill's grounds

26:18.751 --> 26:23.233
because 50 years ago,
a drifter was murdered
on your property.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.410
Heart ripped out
and poppet shoved down
their throat.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.674
What do you want, Betty, hmm?

26:28.717 --> 26:30.414
Because I have a maple
harvest festival to plan.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.633
So can we
cut to the heart of it?

26:33.896 --> 26:36.943
[Alice] You really didn't have
to walk me home, Frank.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.423
I was hoping
that maybe we could talk.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.341
What is there left to say?

26:44.385 --> 26:46.517
How about...

26:46.561 --> 26:48.607
you're not the problem, Alice,
I am.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.564
[scoffs]

26:50.826 --> 26:51.784
[exhales]

26:51.827 --> 26:53.960
Years ago,

26:54.003 --> 26:55.875
when I was a mercenary,
I was married.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.356
No one knew.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.185
Not even Fred or Archie.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.580
Because if anyone found out,
it would put my wife
and my daughter at risk.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.236
And then, of course, um...

27:11.499 --> 27:14.328
My wife and my daughter
ended up, um...

27:14.371 --> 27:15.634
Oh, I'm so sorry, Frank.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.680
Alice.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.161
I want to open myself up
to those feelings again.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.078
I just don't know
if I'm ready yet.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.210
And I'm sorry.

27:27.254 --> 27:28.168
That's okay, Frank.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.302
I understand.

27:34.000 --> 27:34.827
But maybe...

27:36.829 --> 27:38.874
Maybe we can go
to the maple festival together.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.660
Maybe that'll be okay.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.232
[Tabitha sighs]

27:51.626 --> 27:54.063
Here you are.
Straight off the griddle.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.717
Delicious, fluffy
pancakes to go.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.284
Just what I needed

27:57.327 --> 28:00.200
for my festival's pancake
eating contest. [gasps]

28:00.243 --> 28:02.550
But what are these welts
on your arm?

28:03.638 --> 28:05.466
And sleepless eyes to boot?

28:07.250 --> 28:10.645
Tell me, what demons
torment you, Tabitha?

28:12.603 --> 28:14.997
Turns out our apartment
is riddled with bugs

28:15.041 --> 28:16.825
and Jughead and I
are being eaten alive

28:16.869 --> 28:18.958
and we can't afford to move.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.525
And even if we could,
I mean, who's to say
the bugs won't follow us,

28:21.569 --> 28:23.310
now that they're
literally in everything?

28:23.353 --> 28:24.572
Tabitha,

28:24.615 --> 28:26.879
methinks I can help

28:26.922 --> 28:29.142
with an ancient
cleansing formula
I could prepare for you

28:29.185 --> 28:31.884
that will take care of
any and all bugs

28:31.927 --> 28:34.060
and curses.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.541
But said formula
does come with a price.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.456
What doesn't?
I'll pay anything.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.242
If that's true,
I'm going to need
your full participation

28:42.285 --> 28:44.766
in all
my maple festival's events.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.333
But not just yours.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.465
Jughead's too.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.598
If we want our
collective fortunes
to turn around for the better,

28:50.641 --> 28:52.948
we all need to be
united on this.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.998
Pay close attention, girls,
for this is
a special confection

28:59.041 --> 29:01.261
based on an old family recipe.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.394
Back in the early days,
the village priestess
used to bake a sin pie.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.788
It was meant to contain
the sins of the entire town,

29:06.832 --> 29:09.878
and once it was consumed,
the sins would be absolved

29:09.922 --> 29:12.141
and the town
and her folk would prosper.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.839
Consumed?

29:13.882 --> 29:17.277
-By who?
-Someone chosen.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.974
Someone special
and strong enough

29:19.018 --> 29:23.196
to shoulder the weight
of the sins of an entire town.

29:23.239 --> 29:27.896
So I was at the FBI office
researching this poppet doll
that you gave me.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.943
And then I paid Cheryl a visit,
and she is definitely
up to something.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.727
I just don't know what.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.120
Well, I'll tell you.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.339
For starters,

29:36.383 --> 29:40.256
she invited the whole town
to a maple harvest festival
at Thornhill.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.911
And, shockingly,
everyone wants to go.

29:42.955 --> 29:45.218
I don't get it, Betty.
Is the world crazy
or am I?

29:45.261 --> 29:47.176
No, you're not.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.788
Uh, something evil
is definitely happening
at Thornhill,

29:49.831 --> 29:53.313
with that deer sacrifice,
these little pagan dolls

29:53.356 --> 29:54.967
and maybe even
a cold case murder.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.620
But when I tried to confront
Cheryl about it,

29:56.664 --> 29:58.840
she gave me
the total runaround.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.582
-But she's planning something.
-Thank you.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.411
That is why the festival
is a hard pass for me.

30:04.454 --> 30:09.242
Oh, we're going, because
while Cheryl is outside
playing hostess of the year,

30:09.285 --> 30:12.549
I'll be inside Thornhill
doing some
good old-fashioned snooping.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.856
And then we can finally
get to the bottom
of what's happening

30:14.900 --> 30:17.337
in that
pastoral house of horrors.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.522
Hey, get away from me.

30:28.565 --> 30:29.479
Hey, guys.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.352
Hey, Fangs, Toni.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.571
How is this little
cutie patootie doing?

30:34.615 --> 30:39.141
[sighs] A lot better, actually.
He's had colic,
but it's cleared up.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.187
That's good.
Did you guys get help
from Doc Curdle?

30:42.318 --> 30:45.887
We found our own remedy.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.455
Anyway, um,
we're going to go
milk the goat.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.283
But it was so nice
seeing you guys.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.589
-Yeah, you too.
-Good luck today, Archie.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.591
[clicks tongue]

30:54.635 --> 30:57.594
Good luck?
What does that mean?

30:57.638 --> 30:59.814
Who knows?
But seeing Baby Anthony
just makes me

30:59.858 --> 31:02.730
that much more excited
to make one of our own.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.515
[Cheryl] I see you and Reggie
arrived together.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.561
So which ship name
do you prefer?

31:07.604 --> 31:09.345
Veggie? Veginald?

31:09.389 --> 31:11.434
I would hold off
on trademarking
either of those, Cheryl.

31:11.478 --> 31:12.914
What?

31:12.958 --> 31:14.263
No, don't tell me
something already happened.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.571
No, no, we haven't
broken up... yet.

31:17.614 --> 31:21.314
But all of his old insecurities
started rearing
their ugly heads again.

31:21.357 --> 31:25.492
Pretty soon he'll be
comparing himself to Archie,
despite all my reassurances.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.798
If you want to make it
crystal clear to Reginald

31:27.842 --> 31:31.063
that you're no longer
carrying a torch for your ex,
I may have an idea.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.283
[Jughead] Hey, Archie.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.068
Hey, I need you.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.374
Tabitha has been
flipping flapjacks for, like,
18 hours.

31:38.418 --> 31:39.854
And now no one wants
to go against me

31:39.898 --> 31:41.116
in the pancake eating
competition, so...

31:42.726 --> 31:44.380
Well, come on.
Starts in, like, five minutes.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.559
No, this is good.
If you're competing,
then all eyes will be on you,

31:49.603 --> 31:51.735
including Cheryl's.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.389
I'm going to sneak off
and do some sleuthing

31:53.433 --> 31:55.000
while you
keep Cheryl distracted.

32:02.659 --> 32:05.010
[crowd cheering]

32:06.576 --> 32:08.056
And... time!

32:10.406 --> 32:11.973
What's the final count?

32:12.017 --> 32:15.846
Right, by my tally,
Jughead Jones, 116 pancakes!

32:15.890 --> 32:18.197
[crowd cheering]

32:19.459 --> 32:20.851
[woman] Whoo!

32:22.679 --> 32:25.987
And Archie Andrews, 119!

32:26.031 --> 32:27.554
[crowd cheering]

32:27.597 --> 32:29.034
[Tabitha] We have a winner.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.083
You're like a brother to me.

32:36.998 --> 32:37.825
I love you.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.262
You know that, right?

32:41.437 --> 32:42.961
Yeah. I love you back, Jug.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.799
Cheryl, you actually think
it's possible?

32:55.843 --> 32:59.107
If you two want
a path forward together,
unencumbered by the past,

32:59.151 --> 33:01.022
then, yes,

33:01.066 --> 33:02.893
I believe this is the way.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.634
Perhaps the only way.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.725
Ah, perfection.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.075
[bell rings]

33:10.118 --> 33:11.685
Just in time
for our next challenge.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.730
[rock music playing]

33:26.830 --> 33:28.049
[man] Let's go!

33:33.620 --> 33:36.014
[crowd cheering]

33:41.323 --> 33:43.543
And the winner is
Archie Andrews!

33:46.981 --> 33:48.330
Hey.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.592
What the hell was that?

33:49.636 --> 33:52.160
Me losing to Archie, again.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.075
You were supposed to lose.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.382
But, after tonight,

33:56.425 --> 33:59.385
you won't have to worry
about playing second fiddle
to Archie ever again.

33:59.994 --> 34:00.821
Okay?

34:02.562 --> 34:04.346
I promise.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.741
Well, according to my sundial,
it's time for sudden death.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.265
Who here is brave enough
to challenge Archie Andrews

34:10.309 --> 34:13.312
for the crown of Maple King
or Maple Queen?

34:13.355 --> 34:14.530
[Betty] I am.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.056
[crowd murmuring]

34:22.147 --> 34:24.453
Oh, j'adorea good plot twist.

34:24.497 --> 34:26.847
Step right up, cousin.

34:26.890 --> 34:31.243
Fittingly, it all comes down
to the most primal
of conflicts.

34:31.286 --> 34:35.725
Man versus woman,
the all-American boy
versus the girl next door.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.075
I'm giving myself chills.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.123
Hi.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.559
I thought you were sleuthing.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.952
Yeah, I was.
And I found something big.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.214
I'll tell you about it
when we get out.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.959
[sighs] All right.
The rules are simple.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.352
You each get one throw.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.875
Closest to the bull's-eye
wins it all.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.964
The title, the crown,
everything.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.967
Wait, wait,
I thought I won
the last two rounds.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.578
Don't question
my authority, Archie.

35:02.622 --> 35:03.927
For that, you're up first.

35:16.636 --> 35:17.680
[crowd applauding]

35:21.336 --> 35:22.685
Feel free
to bow out now, Betty.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.303
[man] Wow!

35:31.346 --> 35:33.696
-[crowd cheering]
-[man] Oh, my God!

35:33.740 --> 35:35.916
[Cheryl] I give you
our Maple Harvest Queen.

35:35.959 --> 35:36.960
[man] Wow!

35:40.747 --> 35:42.662
And for our runner-up...
a pie.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.142
[man] Whoo!

35:51.323 --> 35:53.412
Wait, you didn't tell me.
What did you find out
at Thornhill?

35:53.455 --> 35:55.892
Oh, there's some definite
weirdness going on there.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.503
Like those poppets?

35:57.546 --> 36:00.375
They're actually
fertility dolls.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.072
-[Archie] What? Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.206
So, why don't we put
this little sucker

36:05.250 --> 36:07.948
under our mattress tonight
and try to make a baby.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.169
After you have some pie.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.779
Can we skip the pie?

36:12.822 --> 36:13.736
[Betty sighs]

36:15.956 --> 36:16.870
No.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.875
My Maple King is going
to need all of the energy
he can muster up

36:21.918 --> 36:23.181
for what I have planned.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.232
Well, when
you put it like that.

36:58.564 --> 36:59.521
[kissing]

37:06.789 --> 37:08.226
[ticking]

37:09.923 --> 37:11.533
[cell phone ringing]

37:17.496 --> 37:19.759
-Betty?
-Archie, it's me.
They, they have Betty.

37:19.802 --> 37:20.890
Kevin?

37:23.502 --> 37:25.939
Kevin, what do you mean,
"They have Betty?"
Who's they?

37:25.982 --> 37:28.376
Cheryl, some of the others,
they're, they're performing
some kind of

37:28.420 --> 37:31.205
crazy maple ritual
at Thornhill.
You need to hurry.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.224
[Archie] Stop!

37:52.182 --> 37:53.183
Don't hurt her.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.185
[Cheryl] Archie, welcome.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.535
We've been expecting you.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.584
-What is this?
-A ritual.

38:04.369 --> 38:08.242
For me and for all of us here,

38:08.286 --> 38:11.419
something has been made
abundantly clear.

38:11.463 --> 38:15.380
If we want our maple trees
to thrive again,

38:15.423 --> 38:18.861
if we want Rivervale to have
a bountiful year
in all respects,

38:20.254 --> 38:22.125
a sacrifice has to be made.

38:22.169 --> 38:26.695
But the right
kind of sacrifice.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.524
Cheryl, this is insane.
I won't let you
sacrifice Betty.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.352
Archie.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.616
Something amazing happened.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.793
I'm with child.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.406
Earlier tonight we conceived.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.278
A baby, a son.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.846
I know it,
I can feel it in my bones.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.238
It's what I've always wanted.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.591
And in 25 years,
he'll be crowned
the Maple King

38:52.634 --> 38:54.157
just like his father.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.115
Betty...

38:57.117 --> 38:58.771
what are you saying?

38:58.814 --> 39:04.037
What she's saying is that
women can't be sacrifices.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.431
Women must bear children.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.476
But men...

39:09.999 --> 39:12.001
Their blood is the seed.

39:12.045 --> 39:15.353
Their blood is what nourishes
the ground and the furrows.

39:15.396 --> 39:18.747
Their blood is what will bring
Rivervale back to its glory.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.491
And the most potent kind
of blood is that of a--

39:23.535 --> 39:24.884
Cheryl, I'm not a virgin.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.323
No, you're certainly not.

39:29.367 --> 39:35.068
But you have the distinction
of being our town's one
true, pure heart.

39:35.111 --> 39:39.812
We needed a king
who was willing to die
for his queen.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.380
Only he would be worthy.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.382
Jug.

39:52.651 --> 39:55.610
Uncle Frank,
you're in on this too?

39:55.654 --> 39:59.353
Archie, you spent
your entire life trying to
preserve and save this town.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.182
Tonight you will succeed
in doing exactly that.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.966
You will be a martyr
to your cause.

40:04.010 --> 40:04.924
But--

40:24.726 --> 40:25.771
Betty.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.033
He's awake, Cheryl, do it now.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.483
She who walks
amongst the trees,

40:42.527 --> 40:45.225
accept our sacrifice
and be appeased.

40:59.587 --> 41:00.588
[groans]

41:20.478 --> 41:24.960
So ends the heroic life
of Archie Andrews.

41:25.004 --> 41:29.051
Born 25 years ago
in the sleepy town
of Riverdale,

41:29.095 --> 41:31.358
died tonight,

41:31.401 --> 41:33.621
in its shadow town, Rivervale.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.930
Now, I hope you've been
enjoying your visit so far

41:37.973 --> 41:39.540
because no one
is going anywhere.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.630
We're just getting started.
