00:00.027 --> 00:02.128
_

00:02.960 --> 00:04.560
Hmm, interesting sign.

00:05.897 --> 00:07.730
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:07.732 --> 00:10.399
- Kinda dark.
- Kinda true.

00:10.401 --> 00:11.578
Hmm.

00:11.578 --> 00:15.480
Same sign, but in a wacky font, right?

00:15.482 --> 00:16.714
'Cause nothing says "You're doomed"

00:16.716 --> 00:18.483
like Comic Sans.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.086
Nothing says...

00:23.260 --> 00:25.619
***

00:25.659 --> 00:27.559
I at least got pity laughs.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.527
- I won't be doing that.
- Hmm.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.162
Well, this'll be fun then.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.665
Um, I'm gonna go, and maybe
once you've read that,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.099
- you can call me.
- Sit.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.569
Okay.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.171
I can't help but notice inconsistencies

00:40.173 --> 00:41.706
in your treatment.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.244
Missed chemo sessions,
erratic radiation schedule.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.745
That won't work.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.681
Virginia, I've never seen you
with a patient before,

00:49.683 --> 00:51.516
but I gotta say, very impressed.

00:51.518 --> 00:54.052
This whole scary-principal
thing you got going on,

00:54.054 --> 00:55.220
it's very effective.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.355
But I am not your normal patient

00:57.357 --> 01:00.692
because I have a huge hospital to run,

01:00.694 --> 01:03.461
and so when it comes to things
like scheduling,

01:03.463 --> 01:05.363
I gotta keep it flexible.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.131
But you learn to love it.

01:08.368 --> 01:11.102
Radiation is set
for this afternoon, 2:00 p.m.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.705
Great. See? Easy.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.607
As long as there's no hospital emergency,

01:15.609 --> 01:16.808
then I will see you there.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.576
Max, you are the emergency.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.045
Radiation is set
for this afternoon, 2:00 p.m.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.614
2:00 p.m., I heard you. But listen.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.782
- I...
- No, you start listening.

01:26.386 --> 01:29.387
Your treatment's impact is cumulative.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.489
Your brain is going to operate

01:31.491 --> 01:33.658
at half the capacity you're used to.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.094
You're going to be in a lot of pain.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.630
And that is if the treatment is working,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.498
But you're not letting it work. Why?

01:40.500 --> 01:43.879
Why? Because I have
a million things to do.

01:43.881 --> 01:45.403
I have a child on the way.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.105
If I'm too far gone by the time
it gets here...

01:47.107 --> 01:49.173
Dr. Sharpe said you'd make excuses.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.075
Did she? Really?

01:51.077 --> 01:54.345
- It's time to get ready, Max.
- Yeah, for what?

01:54.347 --> 01:57.115
To step down as medical director.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.288
We'll see about that.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.294
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:09.295 --> 02:10.762
Hang in there, Lyn.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.597
- Doctor?
- What you got?

02:12.599 --> 02:14.499
An overprotective dad-to-be
who needs to chill out.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.334
Her back's been sore and
she's had these awful headaches

02:16.336 --> 02:17.802
and she's, like, forgetting things.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.270
She nearly fainted at the coffee shop.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.605
It's called having a baby, Michael.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.273
- Vitals?
- Found them right outside.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.474
- We didn't have time.
- All right, we got it.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.476
Thanks. How far along are you?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.545
- 39 weeks.
- Do you have a birth plan?

02:27.547 --> 02:29.380
- Yeah.
- Any allergies?

02:29.382 --> 02:30.782
- No.
- Complications?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.450
Just having these really bad headaches.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.452
Mom's blood pressure: 290/160.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.622
Heart rate 130 and fetal heart
rate 90 and falling.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.123
All right. Trauma One.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.224
We have to do an emergency C-section.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.292
Call OB, but I'm not waiting.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.694
- What, now?
- What?

02:42.696 --> 02:43.795
- What's happening?
- Is the baby okay?

02:43.797 --> 02:45.330
- Michael?
- Just breathe.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.898
- Michael!
- Should I call her doctor?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.869
Clamps and forceps, please.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.205
We won't need the Metz.
Get them off the tray.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.707
- Your name's Michael Archer?
- Uh, yes.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.208
Lift your arms.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.476
Turn around.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.478
Your date of birth is May 28th, 1988?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.513
Patient intubated and sedated.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.848
How we doing?

03:03.850 --> 03:06.250
- Almost prepped...
- Guys, please.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.819
- I need to be in there.
- I need you to lift your foot.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.420
What are the last four digits
of your social?

03:09.422 --> 03:12.724
- Uh, 0501.
- 0501.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.192
And the other foot.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.660
Fetal heart rate still falling.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.228
Preparing to sterilize incision site.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.830
Let's go.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.665
You cannot touch anything in
there unless we say it's okay.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.166
- You got it?
- Yeah.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.935
Okay. Let's go.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.207
- PGA and polyglactin 910.
- Is she okay?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.742
She's sedated to help
with the hypertension,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.210
but we need to get your baby out now

03:32.212 --> 03:33.511
for both of their sakes. Protractor.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.912
- Richardson.
- Where's OB?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.347
Okay, need a little help here.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.582
- Is everything okay?
- Got it?

03:37.584 --> 03:38.750
Okay, hold it nice and wide for me.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.251
What's wrong? Doctor?

03:40.253 --> 03:42.353
- The cord?
- I'm trying.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.721
- Doctor.
- Suction.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.690
Just a little more.

03:48.528 --> 03:53.531
Time of birth, 10:23 a.m.
You have a strong baby boy.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.472
Give me those Apgar scores.

04:01.474 --> 04:02.974
- Yes, doctor.
- All right, I see that.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.380
Birth weight, uh, 7.6 pounds.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.550
Apgar of nine. He's very healthy.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.453
Let's close her up.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.255
How's Lyn? She okay?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.457
No signs of hemorrhaging
or excess bleeding.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.892
She's still hypertensive.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.726
Wanna hold him, Daddy?

04:24.564 --> 04:27.498
There you go. Support his head.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.276
Hi, Robin.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.672
Hey, there!

04:36.910 --> 04:39.577
- Ta-da.
- You amaze me.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.779
I wear paper very well.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.581
I'm not talking about how you look.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.016
I'm talking about how
you're tackling this.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.019
All by yourself. Freezing your eggs.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.620
Lots of women do.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.756
Lots of women aren't chair of oncology.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.526
I knew there was a reason I invited you.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.833
So, that nurse earlier,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.434
thinking I was here to fertilize...

05:03.436 --> 05:05.937
Oh, my God. I mean, can you imagine?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.438
We've only been together a month.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.708
So awkward. So awkward.

05:12.545 --> 05:15.613
That said, I...

05:15.987 --> 05:19.817
I know the biological
pressure you're under.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.687
So what if...

05:22.689 --> 05:26.057
- That's not a reason to...
- No, no, of course not.

05:26.059 --> 05:31.043
I just, um... here I am, able to help.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.999
- Not helping feels...
- No, yeah.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.534
I get it.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.837
I mean, I have thought about it.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.472
- You have?
- Oh, no.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.974
I mean, I've... I've thought about it,

05:42.976 --> 05:44.308
but I haven't, like, thought about it.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.543
Right.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.811
Yeah, it's just a lot to put on this

05:46.813 --> 05:48.579
and on us at this time.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.815
- Hopefully we'll get there.
- Yeah.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.419
I just don't wanna lose our chance.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.393
It's E-day, Helen. Ready to go?

06:06.599 --> 06:12.251
Um, actually, I think I just
need a little bit more time.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.106
You can have till 5:00 p.m.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.575
Any longer, we'll miss our
chance to retrieve

06:17.577 --> 06:19.844
any eggs at all, fertilized or not.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.780
I'll see you at five?

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:32.025 --> 06:33.891
Sandra Fall from billing. How goes it?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.393
Uh, my husband filed for divorce,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.895
- and he's taking the dog.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.463
Don't be. They deserve each other.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.464
- Oh.
- Signature, please.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.699
Sure.

06:41.701 --> 06:42.900
Uh, you know, I would sign just about

06:42.902 --> 06:44.569
anything you put in front of me,

06:44.571 --> 06:46.604
but out of curiosity,
what did I just sign?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.039
Uh, permission for the hospital to sell

06:48.041 --> 06:49.807
delinquent medical bills
to the highest bidder.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.709
To do what now?

06:51.711 --> 06:54.478
- Orders from Karen Brantley.
- Excuse me.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.649
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.117
Forgive me, sorry. Um, yeah.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.653
"Approval to institute a trial program

07:02.655 --> 07:05.423
known as 'the asset
reclamation commitment.'"

07:05.425 --> 07:07.758
ARC, for short. Love a good acronym.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.493
Oh, well, that's an
even better euphemism.

07:09.495 --> 07:10.728
Asset reclamation.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.630
This program sells our patients' debt

07:12.632 --> 07:14.131
to collection agencies.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.900
Yes, so that we may be reimbursed

07:15.902 --> 07:17.501
for their delinquent medical bills.

07:17.503 --> 07:20.004
The thing is, people come here for care,

07:20.006 --> 07:22.406
and this is what bankrupts them.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.442
This hospital currently holds six figures

07:24.444 --> 07:25.743
in outstanding debt,

07:25.745 --> 07:27.078
and we're steaming towards seven.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.079
It's time to do something about it.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.981
Not this.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.917
We found an agency that can
get five cents on the dollar

07:32.919 --> 07:35.119
for our debt. That's real money, Max.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.255
Think of all the good you can do with it.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.799
What if I can do better?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.762
Six cents on the dollar guaranteed,

07:44.764 --> 07:46.762
and nobody goes bankrupt.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.966
Just let me try.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.639
Start with this batch.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.140
You have 24 hours.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.475
Thank you.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.781
Look at what Harper made
for cool Uncle Kapoor.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.216
Oh, God.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.884
- What are you doing?
- Is it an ashtray?

08:06.886 --> 08:08.653
Oh, yes. Yes, Vijay.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.454
My five-year-old daughter made
you an ashtray in school

08:10.456 --> 08:13.557
for all your cigarette butts.
It's a paperweight, man.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.627
- Why does it have grooves?
- It...

08:16.629 --> 08:18.562
I don't know. Maybe it is an ashtray.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.164
But you know, that... that's
the beauty of Harper's work.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.533
The functionality
of each piece truly does lie

08:22.535 --> 08:25.836
- in the eye of the beholder.
- My desk is really very messy.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.906
I have four kids all dabbling
heavily in the arts, all right?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.542
My desk is 99% paste and pasta. Come on.

08:31.544 --> 08:35.046
Plus, you can't pass
on a gift from a child.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.181
Actually, it sounds that you
can't pass on a gift

08:37.183 --> 08:38.849
from a child.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.150
Hey, Dr. Eagan!

08:40.153 --> 08:41.943
You're still a big smoker, right?

08:43.923 --> 08:48.059
- Bonjour from... Pain...
- Good morning, Ella.

08:48.532 --> 08:50.594
What would you like?

08:50.596 --> 08:52.763
I would like to again apologize.

08:52.765 --> 08:55.733
I never meant to imply
that you and my son...

09:01.674 --> 09:04.008
$2.75.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.560
Isn't he amazing?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.062
I don't usually play favorites,

09:25.064 --> 09:26.897
but your son is perfect.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.200
Sabrina, would you just give us a minute?

09:29.202 --> 09:30.534
Hi.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.269
Mr. Archer, I'm, uh, Dr. Goodwin.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.537
Medical director of this hospital.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.939
Is everything okay?

09:34.941 --> 09:38.209
Your paperwork said that Lyn
is your surrogate?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.810
She's also my best friend.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.879
But you paid her to carry the child?

09:41.881 --> 09:44.248
Yes. Uh, we have a contract.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.751
Yeah, I'm afraid that, uh,
surrogacy contracts

09:46.753 --> 09:48.285
aren't valid in the state of New York,

09:48.287 --> 09:51.655
so by law the baby belongs
to the birth mother,

09:51.657 --> 09:55.593
and we can't legally give him
to you without her permission.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.095
Then just ask her. She'll tell you.

10:00.479 --> 10:01.732
What?

10:01.734 --> 10:03.601
We thought delivering
the baby would relieve

10:03.603 --> 10:06.070
Lyn's hypertension, but so far it hasn't.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.838
We're doing everything that we can,

10:07.840 --> 10:11.575
but, uh, she hasn't
regained consciousness.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.310
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
- I'm sorry, Michael.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.246
I know this is hard, but the nurses here

10:15.248 --> 10:17.148
are gonna take amazing care of him.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.784
You can't be serious.
You're taking him now?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.318
Michael, listen to me.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.622
I'm gonna do everything
that I can to help you.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.925
But right now, we need to take him.

10:44.363 --> 10:46.264
I don't need a shrink. I have a contract.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.979
I signed it. Lyn signed it.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.113
It was notarized.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.985
See, she wanted me to have Robin.

10:50.987 --> 10:52.174
Well, I know she did.

10:52.176 --> 10:55.820
But the fact remains that
this is a New Jersey contract.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.555
I know that but... but, okay, here.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.858
"The... the parties agree that
the jurisdiction

10:59.860 --> 11:02.660
"for resolution of any custodial dispute

11:02.662 --> 11:04.863
shall vest in the court
in the state of New Jersey."

11:04.865 --> 11:06.390
Not New York. Jersey, okay?

11:06.392 --> 11:08.733
Okay, okay. I hear you.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.034
Slow down.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.503
Michael, take a breath.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.707
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.141
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.877
I understand.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.512
It's just, I mean, that's New Jersey.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.649
It's right there. I can see it.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.065
Yeah.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.087
Five miles west, I'd be holding my son.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.692
They won't let me hold him.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.624
I guess you got kids?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.502
Yeah.

11:47.086 --> 11:49.507
My little girl made that
masterpiece right there.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.711
I have zero idea what it is.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.781
Everyone who looks at it sees
something completely different.

11:56.783 --> 11:57.916
It's kinda cool, actually.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.520
I see a little girl that loves her dad.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.623
Yeah.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.095
What would you do if someone
tried to take her

12:11.097 --> 12:12.697
away from you?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.870
Is this my cystic fibrosis patient?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.939
Dania Constantin. 12 years old.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.141
Collapsed on a school field
trip with shortness of breath.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.476
Hey, Dania. Doctor Reynolds.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.778
We're gonna take good care of you, okay?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.579
I need the stat chest.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.148
All right, let's go ahead
and get her to Trauma One.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.884
Dania, are you all right?

12:32.886 --> 12:33.918
I just got the call from school.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.420
I'm sorry.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.788
You have nothing to be sorry about.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.013
I'm so sorry, Mom.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.659
Go ahead and give me a big, deep breath.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.927
Deep as you can.

12:44.266 --> 12:45.430
And out.

12:46.530 --> 12:47.598
That's great.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.900
Good job.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.802
Is she having a CF exacerbation?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.105
Don't be afraid to throw
it at me, doctor.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.779
We've seen it all.

12:56.476 --> 13:01.446
Uh, Mrs. Constantin,
in a standard CF exacerbation,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.081
we'd see one impacted area, maybe two.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.149
But this is multifaceted.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.453
Her platelets are down.
Low red and white cell counts.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.922
Infiltrates on her chest.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.690
So this isn't about her CF?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.960
I believe something else triggered this.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.500
Arthroscopic shoulder surgery,

13:22.502 --> 13:25.970
$4,650 still outstanding.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.605
I'm real sorry.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.607
I was in such a hole from
all the time I missed.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.109
I just don't have the money yet.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.778
No, that's okay,
because today I'm proposing

13:33.780 --> 13:36.647
a new way to settle your debt.
Says here you're a plumber.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.016
Yeah.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.817
Plumbers I've met know how to barter.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.688
Anything that you can do
for New Amsterdam,

13:43.690 --> 13:45.723
we'll take it.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.059
- I'm an electrician by trade.
- Perfect.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.561
Wait till you see what that
last storm did to us.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.297
What's the scam, man? This is New York.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.666
- There's always a scam.
- It's no scam.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.135
Just barter and trade.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.636
It's worked like gangbusters
for centuries.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.171
So why don't we bring it back?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.906
So I patch up the cracked
drywall around here

14:01.908 --> 14:03.808
and rip up my bill?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.743
You patch up the cracked
drywall and you will have paid

14:05.745 --> 14:07.964
your bill every bit as much
as if you wrote us a check.

14:07.966 --> 14:09.247
This isn't charity.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.850
This is just us recognizing
the real-world tangible value

14:12.852 --> 14:14.218
of what our patients can offer.

14:14.220 --> 14:18.570
So the question is "How can you help?"

14:18.892 --> 14:22.193
It's a cocker spaniel.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.909
Look at that.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.912
Kids'll love it.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.367
Cough if you need to.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.937
- Hi, thanks for jumping in.
- It's my pleasure.

14:32.939 --> 14:36.340
So, Dania, has anyone
been sick at school?

14:36.342 --> 14:39.710
- Not really.
- Any new pets?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.046
Just my bacteria-covered lizard monster.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.782
- His name is Lungy.
- She's kidding.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.751
Cut it out, goofy.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.053
You're on top of your meds
and your CPT, right?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.588
Uh, her father and I handle therapy.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.256
Dania's in charge of her own meds.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.724
She's a model patient.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.226
You're okay.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.896
Honey, you're okay. I'm right here.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.565
Any recent travel?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.233
I wish. We've had to cut back.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.117
We're remodeling, adding a nursery.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.272
Uh, did this new construction
have any leaks

15:08.274 --> 15:11.375
- in the recent storms?
- Oh, God.

15:11.915 --> 15:13.277
You're thinking mold?

15:13.279 --> 15:16.247
Aspegillosis fungal infection
could explain her symptoms.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.582
Some of them.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.749
Her white blood cell count's low.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.284
You'd expect high with infection.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.588
But if it is black mold,
there's no time to waste.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.890
Okay, we're gonna give you voriconazole,

15:25.892 --> 15:27.925
ceftazidime, and tobramycin.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.094
If it's fungal, that'll wipe it out.

15:30.517 --> 15:32.730
But how could this happen?

15:37.303 --> 15:39.937
We need to prep Lyn for surgery.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.273
We should know in an hour
or two if the clipping

15:42.275 --> 15:44.842
has lowered her intracranial pressure.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.944
Dr. Kapoor will be overseeing it.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.114
And our grandson? Can we see him?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.916
Uh, this is Dr. Frome.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.619
I've asked him to consult
on this case in his role

15:54.621 --> 15:56.020
- as a child advocate.
- Yeah.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.855
Forgive me for asking,
but you are aware that Lyn

15:57.857 --> 16:00.258
was not the egg donor for this baby?

16:00.547 --> 16:01.993
Yeah, that since she
was just the carrier,

16:01.995 --> 16:04.695
she and this child are not
genetically related in any way?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.698
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.135
Um, I... I apologize for having
to discuss paperwork

16:11.137 --> 16:12.770
at such a painful time. I really do.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.138
But, uh, if you'd take a look, please.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.841
- What is this?
- Um, that's a waiver.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.876
Although Lyn and Michael
shared a contract,

16:18.878 --> 16:20.645
um, surrogacy is still currently illegal

16:20.647 --> 16:22.013
in New York, but the good news

16:22.015 --> 16:24.715
is as Lyn's parents,
you can sign on her behalf

16:24.717 --> 16:27.018
to allow the father to take custody.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.186
No.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.158
Uh, Mrs. Sackhoff, this baby's father

16:34.160 --> 16:36.827
is sitting in my office
waiting to hold his son.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.796
I am not giving him to some stranger.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.231
Um, Mrs. Sackhoff...

16:40.233 --> 16:43.000
Some man who pays women
to carry children?

16:43.002 --> 16:46.304
Ma'am, I know this is a, uh,
complicated situation,

16:46.306 --> 16:49.674
but this child is not yours.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.678
He's... he's the last piece
I have of my daughter.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.181
He's our grandson,
and we're taking him home.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.353
Thank you.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.893
Help! Help!

17:11.231 --> 17:14.031
She's in V-tech. We need to defibrillate.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.248
Found some blood.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.270
Charging. Clear.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.907
Going again. Clear.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.378
She's back. Normal sign as regular.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.047
You see this?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.452
We were wrong. This wasn't fungal.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.020
I'm gonna get her down to the OR,

17:36.022 --> 17:37.788
find out where the blood is coming from.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.290
What is it? What's wrong with her?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.425
We're doing everything
we can to find out.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.261
I'll be right back.

17:48.219 --> 17:50.721
Advancing through the pylorus
into the duodenum.

17:50.723 --> 17:52.056
- With McDonald's.
- I don't see it yet.

17:52.058 --> 17:54.801
Why did I push for the voriconazole?

17:55.499 --> 17:57.332
All the signs pointed in that direction.

17:57.334 --> 18:00.001
Yeah, well now she's being
compromised by antifungal meds

18:00.003 --> 18:03.605
she didn't need on top of
her cystic fibrosis.

18:04.546 --> 18:06.541
There. Right there.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.009
Bleeding ulcer.

18:08.011 --> 18:10.478
- Cauterizing now.
- Good find.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.314
Well, I'll take the
compliment when we figure out

18:13.316 --> 18:14.516
what's hurting this girl.

18:14.518 --> 18:16.551
It's the low white blood cell count.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.953
That's the piece that's never fit.

18:18.955 --> 18:20.955
You thinking a myelodysplastic syndrome?

18:20.957 --> 18:22.624
That's the best angle we have right now.

18:22.626 --> 18:23.992
Once she's recovered,

18:23.994 --> 18:26.318
I'll obtain a bone marrow biopsy.

18:26.997 --> 18:28.887
We're missing something.

18:49.653 --> 18:51.986
Dr. Stauton, who are you waiting for?

18:51.988 --> 18:54.046
Dr. Goodwin. He has a session now.

18:54.071 --> 18:56.487
Oh, no, his session was rescheduled.

18:59.548 --> 19:02.516
Rescheduled? By whom?

19:02.518 --> 19:05.819
By Dr. Goodwin.

19:08.657 --> 19:11.025
The cost of treatment
for multiple sclerosis

19:11.027 --> 19:14.161
- has tripled since 1993.
- I noticed.

19:14.163 --> 19:17.031
Yeah, big pharma just keeps
jacking up the DMTs.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.166
Sadly our current system refuses

19:19.168 --> 19:22.703
to limit these increases,
which is why I'm trying

19:22.705 --> 19:26.169
a new thing where we barter
for your debt.

19:26.642 --> 19:29.643
- Like a yard sale?
- Kind of.

19:29.645 --> 19:31.812
What are your skills? What do you do?

19:31.814 --> 19:33.647
- I'm a painter.
- Mmm, perfect.

19:33.649 --> 19:34.848
Well, the lobby could use a fresh coat.

19:34.850 --> 19:36.550
Not that kind of painter.

19:36.552 --> 19:41.393
Uh, less Sherwin-Williams,
more Georgia O'Keeffe.

19:42.024 --> 19:43.103
Oh.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.592
Huh.

19:45.594 --> 19:47.661
So much for the easy way out, huh?

19:49.498 --> 19:51.732
I can't tell you how many gigs
I've lost because

19:51.734 --> 19:53.167
of my condition.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.741
All right, Georgia O'Keeffe.
Here's your canvas.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.576
I think I need to buy a lot more paint.

20:02.578 --> 20:03.944
Um, yeah.

20:03.946 --> 20:05.612
Then, uh, well, you better get to work.

20:05.614 --> 20:06.947
But you're gonna be great.

20:10.219 --> 20:12.786
Well, if it isn't my former oncologist.

20:12.788 --> 20:14.922
- Aren't you peppy.
- You sound surprised.

20:14.924 --> 20:17.791
Well, after all your emo
misgivings about working

20:17.793 --> 20:19.593
with Dr. Stauton, I feared the worst.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.228
- Oh, she's been a delight.
- Really?

20:21.230 --> 20:22.763
Like a summer breeze, that woman.

20:22.765 --> 20:23.931
You do realize I know her, right?

20:23.933 --> 20:25.766
Yeah, you know, it's not too late

20:25.768 --> 20:27.534
to take me back,
and I would think about it

20:27.536 --> 20:31.538
if I was you 'cause this offer
will expire in, um... never.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.073
- Please, please take me back.
- Max.

20:33.075 --> 20:35.609
- Yeah.
- Friends, colleagues.

20:35.611 --> 20:37.945
Friends and colleagues is...

20:37.947 --> 20:39.646
Clear delineation till you get better.

20:39.648 --> 20:41.982
Right, but she is so mean.
I mean, she's, like, crazy.

20:41.984 --> 20:43.217
She's like a werewolf or something.

20:43.219 --> 20:45.152
Okay, I'm on board. Fine.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.588
So as my colleague, would you take a look

20:47.590 --> 20:48.589
- at this, please?
- Mm-hmm.

20:48.591 --> 20:49.790
It's my CF patient.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.592
Everything's failing at the same time

20:51.594 --> 20:54.228
- and we can't see why.
- These numbers are atrocious.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.497
That's the only place that
she's not overachieving.

20:56.499 --> 20:57.798
She's top of her class,

20:57.800 --> 20:58.966
highly involved in extracurriculars.

20:58.968 --> 21:00.634
Volunteers in the community.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.836
I mean no one deserves
such a nasty disease,

21:02.838 --> 21:04.805
- but such an inspiring girl?
- Mmm.

21:04.807 --> 21:07.270
Well, maybe she's getting a little help.

21:07.843 --> 21:10.644
What, you mean drugs? She's 12.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.246
Yeah, sounds like she has
more on her plate

21:12.248 --> 21:13.780
than most 12-year-olds can handle.

21:22.158 --> 21:23.657
Hi.

21:31.867 --> 21:35.769
Um, Rohan just told me this
was a family piece

21:35.771 --> 21:37.104
when he gave it to me.

21:37.106 --> 21:38.705
Uh, but from the look on your face,

21:38.707 --> 21:40.641
I'm guessing it belonged
to your late wife.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.713
I don't know what's going on
between you and your son,

21:46.715 --> 21:49.377
but I have no intention
of being in the middle of it.

21:49.379 --> 21:52.786
But I certainly never meant
to hurt you, so...

22:07.036 --> 22:10.571
I know we're not great,
but I hope you know I'd never

22:10.573 --> 22:13.040
do that to you.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.231
Hey, how's it going?

22:33.233 --> 22:36.029
Uh, well, legal put in an
emergency injunction request

22:36.031 --> 22:37.277
for Michael.

22:38.100 --> 22:41.235
They've all made statements
so now we're waiting.

22:41.237 --> 22:45.285
- Hmm, and, uh, Lyn?
- Still in surgery.

22:46.075 --> 22:47.120
Yeah.

22:51.046 --> 22:54.915
Frankly Lyn Sachoff's
intentions are clear.

22:54.917 --> 22:57.384
The contract's claim is compelling.

22:57.386 --> 23:01.054
However, the interstate
dispute here is beyond

23:01.056 --> 23:02.389
this court's remit.

23:02.391 --> 23:04.925
So I'm bound to issue an injunction

23:04.927 --> 23:07.194
I take no joy in making.

23:07.196 --> 23:10.230
Until the conflict is resolved
by a higher court,

23:10.232 --> 23:12.099
neither party may have custody.

23:12.101 --> 23:14.735
The legal guardian will be
the New York Department

23:14.737 --> 23:16.069
of Social Services.

23:16.071 --> 23:18.105
The baby is to be placed in foster care.

23:18.107 --> 23:21.108
Your Honor, uh, this child's
genetic father is here

23:21.110 --> 23:22.376
begging to take him home,

23:22.378 --> 23:24.211
as are the birth mother's parents.

23:24.213 --> 23:28.782
And this court's answer
is to send this wanted newborn

23:28.784 --> 23:31.318
- into foster care?
- It's the law.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.721
I'm sorry, Dr. Goodwin.
My hands are tied.

23:44.331 --> 23:46.265
This isn't over yet.
Our legal team can file

23:46.267 --> 23:47.900
an appeal by tomorrow.

23:47.902 --> 23:50.603
- Oh, we'll lose.
- No, you don't know that.

23:51.450 --> 23:53.516
Max, do you think this
is the first case like this?

23:53.777 --> 23:55.162
This is not unique.

23:55.163 --> 23:57.330
And while we're appealing,
Robin will be in foster care.

23:57.332 --> 23:59.365
- Not for days, for months.
- I know.

23:59.367 --> 24:02.134
It's unfair, and it's cruel.

24:11.012 --> 24:12.330
Michael.

24:14.682 --> 24:16.349
If you let your son go to foster care,

24:16.351 --> 24:18.551
you will be introducing him
to a world that is cruel

24:18.553 --> 24:20.653
and unfair.

24:20.655 --> 24:22.555
Far more cruel than this.

24:22.557 --> 24:24.891
So, what are you saying?
I should just give up?

24:24.893 --> 24:26.325
I'm saying you should fight.

24:28.062 --> 24:30.029
You should fight to give
your son the best life

24:30.031 --> 24:31.397
that he could possibly have.

24:33.568 --> 24:35.067
Even if it's not with you.

24:46.281 --> 24:48.281
We have a 7:00 a.m. check in.

24:48.283 --> 24:50.249
Patient's last name,
the surgery will not start

24:50.251 --> 24:52.084
until 9:00 a.m.

24:52.086 --> 24:54.287
Did you find anything in her bone marrow?

24:54.289 --> 24:57.056
I'm afraid that's not the culprit.

24:57.058 --> 25:00.059
Sabra, um...

25:00.061 --> 25:03.529
Is it possible that
Dania's been experimenting?

25:03.531 --> 25:07.052
With drugs? No.

25:07.602 --> 25:09.635
Opioids attack white blood cells.

25:09.637 --> 25:11.437
And if she's taking street pills,

25:11.439 --> 25:13.706
the cutting agents could account
for all her other symptoms.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.541
But Dania would never do that.

25:15.543 --> 25:18.577
- Are you sure?
- I know my daughter.

25:21.115 --> 25:23.749
Go ahead. You won't find anything.

25:36.164 --> 25:38.497
Those are all her standard CF meds.

25:38.499 --> 25:40.466
I told you, I know my daughter.

25:43.972 --> 25:45.738
This was refilled two weeks ago.

25:47.308 --> 25:48.774
There should only be four pills left.

25:52.313 --> 25:54.647
Dania stopped taking her
pancreatic enzyme pills.

25:54.649 --> 25:56.182
Her body's not digesting fats.

25:56.184 --> 25:58.645
Leading to a vitamin A deficiency.

25:59.354 --> 26:01.120
I'll go order the IV.

26:04.659 --> 26:07.193
She stopped on purpose.

26:07.195 --> 26:08.494
Why would she do that?

26:15.103 --> 26:18.304
Oh, wow, looking great.
It's, uh... it's a horse.

26:18.306 --> 26:21.507
No, it's a field of corn? I don't know.

26:21.509 --> 26:23.042
But you know what? Don't tell me

26:23.044 --> 26:24.510
because I'm a big
believer in the process.

26:24.512 --> 26:27.013
- Art is life.
- "Art is life."

26:27.015 --> 26:29.215
Should I be getting medical
treatment at MoMA now?

26:29.217 --> 26:31.017
Hey, did you rip that out of the wall?

26:31.019 --> 26:32.685
This came from your "electrician" working

26:32.687 --> 26:34.220
in the hallway.

26:34.222 --> 26:35.388
There's no need
for the "air quotes," okay?

26:35.390 --> 26:37.289
Fran is fully bonded and licensed.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.159
But she was engaged under
your "bartering" agreement.

26:40.161 --> 26:41.794
Again with the "air quotes."

26:41.796 --> 26:46.799
So, your answer to our debt
issue is bartering?

26:46.801 --> 26:49.201
Look, I promised to get six
cents on the dollar

26:49.203 --> 26:50.569
for our debt within 24 hours.
That's what I did.

26:50.571 --> 26:52.038
Mission accomplished.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.472
The only thing you've accomplished

26:53.474 --> 26:55.307
is turning this hospital
into a flea market.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.675
Yeah, and who doesn't love
a good flea market?

26:56.677 --> 26:58.377
Sorry, I'm not seeing the problem.

26:58.379 --> 27:02.248
The problem is you're paying
$48,000 to Fran

27:02.250 --> 27:04.250
to fix five light fixtures.

27:04.252 --> 27:06.652
The only people who can justify
a cost like that

27:06.654 --> 27:08.387
are the military and the mafia.

27:08.389 --> 27:11.090
On the books this looks like
money laundering.

27:11.092 --> 27:12.525
- We'll be audited.
- Yeah,

27:12.527 --> 27:15.161
- but if we just explain...
- No, no explaining.

27:15.163 --> 27:16.695
This is not how you run a hospital.

27:16.697 --> 27:18.531
- This is over. End it.
- I can't do that.

27:18.533 --> 27:22.234
- You can. You will.
- This is a public hospital.

27:22.236 --> 27:25.337
We care for people at the
lowest points in their lives.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.873
And we do it no matter who they
are or where they're from

27:27.875 --> 27:30.576
or whether or not they can pay.
That's the gig.

27:30.578 --> 27:34.080
And yes, I understand
everything costs something.

27:34.082 --> 27:36.215
But these people, they trust us.

27:36.217 --> 27:39.385
And that trust is sacred.

27:39.387 --> 27:41.887
So believe me when I tell you,
there is no way that I'm gonna

27:41.889 --> 27:45.558
let you hound them for money.

27:47.261 --> 27:48.594
The bartering you've done today,

27:48.596 --> 27:50.896
I'll let it stand. Fran is golden.

27:50.898 --> 27:52.598
Thank you.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.768
But that will be the end
of this billing system

27:55.770 --> 27:59.599
built on rainbows and magical thinking.

28:00.141 --> 28:01.740
Bills exist.

28:01.742 --> 28:04.229
And it's my job to make sure we pay them.

28:05.580 --> 28:08.447
- I want you to succeed, Max.
- Hmm.

28:08.449 --> 28:11.617
If we work together,
I'll be your greatest advocate.

28:13.287 --> 28:16.589
But if you work against me, I'll bury you

28:16.591 --> 28:18.557
before your cancer does.

28:33.241 --> 28:34.807
What are you, five?

28:34.809 --> 28:37.409
Just give me my keys
and I'll be on my way.

28:37.411 --> 28:40.446
Sure, right after you finish
your course of radiation.

28:40.448 --> 28:41.914
Yeah, well, I would,
but my appointment isn't

28:41.916 --> 28:44.350
- for another several hours.
- That's strange.

28:44.352 --> 28:45.818
I could have sworn it was supposed

28:45.820 --> 28:47.353
to have already started.

28:47.355 --> 28:50.256
It was, and then I had
an emergency come up

28:50.258 --> 28:52.658
- requiring me to switch it.
- So you switched it?

28:52.660 --> 28:54.360
Correct, to later today.

28:54.362 --> 28:56.662
Know any other patients who
go into the system

28:56.664 --> 28:58.497
and switch their appointments on a whim?

28:58.499 --> 29:00.332
It wasn't a whim.

29:00.334 --> 29:02.701
It was a real emergency
that I was dealing with.

29:02.703 --> 29:04.670
So your cancer isn't a real emergency?

29:04.672 --> 29:06.639
I didn't say that.

29:06.641 --> 29:10.209
Max, when you tell me
you missed radiation

29:10.211 --> 29:12.978
because people need you,
I don't hear a good man

29:12.980 --> 29:14.780
making a hard choice.

29:14.782 --> 29:16.682
I hear somebody choosing to die.

29:16.684 --> 29:20.352
Today you had a choice.
And you chose to die.

29:20.354 --> 29:23.322
I'll ask you again tomorrow
and hopefully you will have

29:23.324 --> 29:25.524
your head in the game then.

29:25.526 --> 29:29.228
Because frankly I don't know
how many tomorrows you've got.

29:29.230 --> 29:30.863
Hear this.

29:30.865 --> 29:33.666
People who treat cancer the way
you're treating cancer

29:33.668 --> 29:35.634
do not survive.

29:37.838 --> 29:40.706
Do you want to die, Max?

29:45.713 --> 29:46.712
No.

29:55.756 --> 29:59.425
Radiation is expecting you. 3B.

30:01.996 --> 30:03.229
3B.

30:06.734 --> 30:08.434
Max.

30:15.276 --> 30:16.742
This is how you get better.

30:25.052 --> 30:27.886
I'm afraid the clipping
procedure has not relieved

30:27.888 --> 30:30.522
Lyn's intracranial brain pressure.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.427
Is there a cure?

30:35.429 --> 30:37.730
Surgery to place a ventricular shunt

30:37.732 --> 30:40.532
- in her head, but...
- Excuse me.

30:45.373 --> 30:46.739
How is she?

30:49.076 --> 30:50.909
We must prepare for the worst.

30:58.452 --> 31:01.954
You, uh... you've raised
an amazing woman.

31:03.457 --> 31:04.590
Thank you.

31:10.398 --> 31:13.999
That's why I'm, uh, withdrawing my case.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.441
He can't grow up in foster care.

31:23.844 --> 31:25.811
My son...

31:28.849 --> 31:31.477
He needs to be with people who love him,

31:32.687 --> 31:34.420
even if that's not with me.

31:36.657 --> 31:39.658
And if you do as good a job
with him as you did with Lyn,

31:39.660 --> 31:41.327
then he's gonna be...

31:59.347 --> 32:02.448
You hang in there, okay?
I'll see you soon.

32:16.664 --> 32:18.608
Someone please tell Robin

32:20.000 --> 32:21.734
that his daddy loves him.

32:43.298 --> 32:44.699
Sweetie.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.526
Mom?

32:52.809 --> 32:54.342
Why?

32:54.769 --> 32:56.644
Why did you stop taking your pills?

32:58.948 --> 33:01.649
I didn't mean for it to go so far.

33:02.905 --> 33:06.106
Did something happen
at school with your friends?

33:08.663 --> 33:10.096
Dania?

33:11.920 --> 33:13.219
Is this about the baby?

33:19.702 --> 33:21.671
What if you have another me?

33:23.464 --> 33:25.873
Then I'd be the luckiest mom
in the world.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.708
I'm so much work.

33:27.971 --> 33:29.438
And when I stopped taking the pills,

33:29.440 --> 33:33.942
you didn't even notice.
I wanted you to see.

33:33.944 --> 33:35.177
See what?

33:35.179 --> 33:37.179
That if you're taking care of the baby,

33:37.478 --> 33:39.614
you can't take care of me.

33:43.854 --> 33:46.121
Dania, do you know why I waited 12 years

33:46.123 --> 33:47.522
to have another baby?

33:47.524 --> 33:50.358
'Cause you weren't ready after me.

33:50.825 --> 33:54.412
I've been ready since
the day you were born.

33:54.865 --> 33:57.199
I waited until you were ready.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.367
Until you could advocate for yourself.

33:59.369 --> 34:03.371
And kiddo, look at your life.

34:03.373 --> 34:05.440
You're amazing.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.612
Am I in trouble?

34:10.614 --> 34:13.054
So much trouble.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.949
Come here, baby.

34:26.817 --> 34:28.063
Well, think they'll be okay?

34:28.404 --> 34:30.398
Yeah, yeah.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.567
Me and my mum fought all the time,

34:32.569 --> 34:35.237
but we always made up.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.972
Think you'll be the same
with your own kid?

34:36.974 --> 34:38.639
- Uh...
- How's that going?

34:40.409 --> 34:42.710
Uh, it's, um...

34:43.679 --> 34:46.422
It's complicated.

34:47.417 --> 34:50.717
- You having doubts?
- On so many levels.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.597
Well, don't.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.259
'Cause you would make
an incredible mother.

35:16.413 --> 35:17.746
You were right.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.385
The bracelet did belong to my wife.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.389
It was part of a set of heirloom jewelry.

35:29.026 --> 35:31.359
Mothers pass on these to their daughters.

35:33.363 --> 35:37.390
It's one of the only things I
kept of my wife after she died.

35:38.635 --> 35:40.302
To remind me of her.

35:41.972 --> 35:44.306
It's been incomplete
for the last two years.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.733
Just missing the bracelet.

35:48.245 --> 35:50.145
I'm so sorry.

35:50.147 --> 35:55.483
All this time I thought that
Rohan had sold this for drugs.

35:57.254 --> 36:01.256
At the funeral I accused him
of it and he... he denied it.

36:01.258 --> 36:03.124
And I called him a liar...

36:04.561 --> 36:06.394
At his mother's grave.

36:08.632 --> 36:10.632
I see.

36:10.634 --> 36:14.002
So seeing you with the bracelet showed me

36:14.004 --> 36:16.504
how wrong I was.

36:16.506 --> 36:19.774
How wrong I had been about my own son.

36:22.246 --> 36:25.247
I should have listened to him,
what he told me.

36:25.249 --> 36:28.316
That... that he wanted something
of his mother's to cherish...

36:30.254 --> 36:32.087
As much as he cherished her.

36:33.757 --> 36:37.692
So give this to Rohan.

36:37.694 --> 36:41.196
His mother would want him to have it.

36:41.198 --> 36:45.166
Please tell him that his papa is sorry.

36:56.713 --> 36:58.380
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

37:04.721 --> 37:05.820
Ready?

37:08.292 --> 37:13.395
Today you offered me
the most amazing gift

37:13.397 --> 37:15.330
that I could ever hope for.

37:18.034 --> 37:19.934
But I can't take you up on it.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.571
I am crazy about you.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.708
But we're not there yet.

37:28.545 --> 37:31.087
And I really like where we are.

37:32.129 --> 37:34.182
Totally agree.

37:34.184 --> 37:38.586
Just, um, I got caught up
in the possibility of...

37:40.524 --> 37:41.931
Us.

37:43.226 --> 37:44.452
Me, too.

37:47.264 --> 37:49.188
But there's no rush.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.333
We can wait until we're ready.

37:53.603 --> 37:55.704
Will you join me at my harvest?

37:58.775 --> 38:01.443
It's cool that it turns
me on when you talk

38:01.445 --> 38:04.412
like a farmer, right?

38:05.935 --> 38:07.035
Michael!

38:08.452 --> 38:10.218
What you did back there,

38:10.220 --> 38:11.919
Lyn's parents want to talk to you.

38:21.398 --> 38:25.934
We just wanted to hold onto our girl

38:25.936 --> 38:28.370
in case she doesn't wake up.

38:28.372 --> 38:32.307
But we need to honor what
she did while she was here.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.480
And what she did, she did for you.

38:39.196 --> 38:41.383
Here you go.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.651
Are you...

38:51.828 --> 38:54.796
Yeah.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.902
Thank you.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.174
Hey, little guy.

39:11.948 --> 39:13.748
Hi!

39:24.294 --> 39:27.762
- Um, I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

39:34.771 --> 39:38.339
Now that is a face I've seen
on many a patient

39:38.341 --> 39:40.542
of Dr. Stauton.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.877
I may have jumped the gun
on that summer breeze comment.

39:42.879 --> 39:45.713
Yeah.

39:45.715 --> 39:48.650
She prescribed an attitude adjustment.

39:48.652 --> 39:53.455
Apparently I need to prioritize
my treatment.

39:56.726 --> 39:59.068
That's why I sent you to her.

39:59.863 --> 40:03.113
The cancer has to come first.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.868
She says I need to focus on my cancer,

40:06.870 --> 40:10.972
stop moving so fast,
but everything in me says

40:10.974 --> 40:15.243
when I stop moving,
the cancer will catch up.

40:17.414 --> 40:18.646
So just keep moving.

40:21.985 --> 40:26.054
'Cause I'm not... I'm not done yet.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.592
I wanna leave something behind, you know?

40:30.594 --> 40:31.693
I wanna...

40:35.432 --> 40:36.898
Do something that matters.

40:39.002 --> 40:41.603
But everywhere I look,
all I see is everything

40:41.605 --> 40:45.940
the cancer is trying to take away.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.380
Then you're not looking
in the right places.

40:59.389 --> 41:02.423
Almost done. What'cha think?

41:04.628 --> 41:07.095
I'd say it's not a bad thing
to leave behind.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.615
How you doing?

41:31.388 --> 41:32.554
Sorry about that, sir.

41:32.556 --> 41:35.623
Whoa, whoa! What's this?

41:35.625 --> 41:36.991
You put it on your head.

41:36.993 --> 41:39.961
Uh, yeah, I do.

41:45.435 --> 41:46.801
It's okay. It's okay.

41:46.803 --> 41:49.504
Oh, my gosh! Look at you guys!

41:51.641 --> 41:53.575
Oh, my gosh! Look at this one!

41:53.577 --> 41:55.343
Holy cow!
