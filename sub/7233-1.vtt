07:29.880 --> 07:31.760
Peter, I know
it's pretty up here,

07:31.760 --> 07:35.520
but don't you think eating
radishes in trees is,

07:35.520 --> 07:37.420
well, a little bit crazy?

07:37.420 --> 07:38.120
BENJAMIN BUNNY: Ah!

07:38.120 --> 07:40.830
Someone say crazy?

07:40.830 --> 07:44.090
[LAUGHING] I said it,
and I was upside down.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.200
Woohoo!

07:45.200 --> 07:47.100
Thanks for helping
us out, Nutkin.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.730
Anything for my
long-eared friends.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.040
Flippitty, rabbitty,
three rabbits in a tree.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.430
[LAUGHING] Oh, yeah.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.810
BENJAMIN BUNNY: I'm
not hungry anymore.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.760
NUTKIN: You know the best
way to work up an appetite?

07:58.760 --> 07:59.930
Hmm?

07:59.930 --> 08:01.030
Juggling!
Whoo!

08:01.030 --> 08:02.000
Hm.
Hm-hm.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.980
U-huh.
Ahaha!

08:02.980 --> 08:03.680
Uh-hum.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.650
Uh-hum.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.630
PETER RABBIT: Hey!

08:05.630 --> 08:06.750
Careful with those!

08:06.750 --> 08:07.720
Watch out, Peter!

08:07.720 --> 08:09.310
NUTKIN: [LAUGHING]

08:09.310 --> 08:10.010
[MUMBLING]

08:10.010 --> 08:11.490
Whoa!

08:11.490 --> 08:12.750
PETER RABBIT: Uh.

08:12.750 --> 08:13.450
Whoa!

08:13.450 --> 08:14.430
Whoa!

08:14.430 --> 08:15.910

08:15.910 --> 08:17.170
Ohh!

08:17.170 --> 08:17.870
Whoo!

08:17.870 --> 08:19.830
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

08:19.830 --> 08:20.610
Oh.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.310
No!

08:26.710 --> 08:31.170
[CREAKING]

08:31.170 --> 08:33.059
Sorry about that, my friend.

08:33.059 --> 08:36.059
Once again, my swirly
exuberance got the best of me

08:36.059 --> 08:38.309
and cause untold heartache.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.490
[WHIMPERS] Watch this.

08:40.490 --> 08:42.409
Whoa!

08:42.409 --> 08:46.070
[LAUGHS] You can open
your eyes now, Benjamin.

08:46.070 --> 08:47.120
We're on the ground.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.120
Ah, ah, I knew that.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.730
Ahm, I was just doing
an extra long blink.

08:53.730 --> 08:55.700
The radishes are gone!

08:55.700 --> 08:58.370
The radish robber must
have followed us here too!

08:58.370 --> 09:00.230
I say, we could
hold our breath,

09:00.230 --> 09:03.110
dive to the bottom of the river,
and eat our radishes there.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.650
Or I know a perfect
spot at Hilltop Farm!

09:06.650 --> 09:09.240
We should tie it to a
bird, and eat it in the sky!

09:09.240 --> 09:10.010
Ooh.

09:10.010 --> 09:12.140
We should bury it
until next summer!

09:12.140 --> 09:12.950
Hey!

09:12.950 --> 09:13.650
Huh?

09:13.650 --> 09:17.930
What if we just, you
know, eat it right now?

09:17.930 --> 09:19.130
Brilliant!

09:19.130 --> 09:19.830
BENJAMIN BUNNY: Yeah!

09:19.830 --> 09:21.420
Radish time!

09:21.420 --> 09:22.680
I tell you what though.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.890
If I ever get my paws on
whoever took our radishes,

09:25.890 --> 09:26.900
there'll be a--

09:26.900 --> 09:29.340
a-- a, furry?

09:29.340 --> 09:31.010
[GASPS] Mr. Tod!

[SNIFFS] Three little rabbits
out in the woods all alone?

09:38.190 --> 09:40.660
You shouldn't
sneak up like that.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.080
I am a fox.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.590
Sneaking is sort of what I do.

09:44.590 --> 09:45.290
Oh!

09:45.290 --> 09:46.340
And what's this?

09:46.340 --> 09:47.900
A radish?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.310
Mmm.

09:49.310 --> 09:52.520
I am quite keen on the
peppery flavour of raphanus

09:52.520 --> 09:54.770
sativus as it happens.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.990
Maybe, he's the radish robber.

09:56.990 --> 10:00.110
MR. TOD: Ah, come,
come, Peter Rabbit.

10:00.110 --> 10:04.010
Even your father never
tried to outfox a fox. .

10:06.940 --> 10:10.120
PETER RABBIT: Dad's
secret escape.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.530
Good ol' dad.

10:11.530 --> 10:13.150
Very well, Mr. Tod.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.890
Ugh!

10:14.890 --> 10:18.820
You may have captured our last
radish, but you won't catch us.

10:24.350 --> 10:27.250

10:27.250 --> 10:30.220
Ah, well, the main
dish may have escaped,

10:30.220 --> 10:32.170
but the salad is intact.

brought them home.

around in the woods.

Well done, Cottontail!

11:16.460 --> 11:18.050
Good scavenging!

11:18.050 --> 11:20.480
Much less dangerous
than say, taking them

11:20.480 --> 11:23.150
from Mr. McGregor's garden.
