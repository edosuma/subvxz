00:56.000 --> 00:57.600
Can I offer anyone some more coffee?

00:57.667 --> 00:58.767
No, thanks, Rose.

00:58.834 --> 01:02.433
Rod, we'd better go before
we wear out our welcome.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.667
Too late.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.033
Well, we certainly
enjoyed having you.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.633
Yeah, right.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.800
Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:12.867 --> 01:14.600
-Bye.
-Good night already.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.700
Ma, I cannot believe you
rushing them out like that.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.367
They were here forever.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.567
Two hours to eat
pasta and a lousy salad?

01:23.633 --> 01:25.800
Your father ate,
read the newspaper,

01:25.867 --> 01:28.433
made love, had a pedicure,
all within an hour.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.934
And without leaving the table.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.867
I think the McDowell's
were delightful.

01:36.934 --> 01:39.266
-Me too.
-Me too.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.333
I love to welcome people
to the neighborhood.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.433
Back home, I used to run our town's
welcome wagon.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.667
Oh, boy, was that fun.

01:51.734 --> 01:54.300
Whenever a new family
moved into St. Olaf,

01:54.367 --> 01:59.100
we'd hop on the tractor,
ride out to the new neighbor's farm,

01:59.166 --> 02:02.700
30 or 40 of us carrying vats
of smoked fish

02:02.767 --> 02:06.967
and big pitchers of freshly squeezed
potato juice,

02:07.033 --> 02:09.700
while cousin dak played
"Getting to know you"

02:09.767 --> 02:11.734
through the hole in his windpipe.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.166
Did you ever accompany him
through the hole in your head?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.033
(doorbell rings)

02:21.100 --> 02:23.233
Sophia, would you get that?

02:23.300 --> 02:24.667
No problem.

02:24.734 --> 02:27.300
I'll drag my bad leg
over to the door.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.400
Ma'am,
you shouldn't open the door

02:31.467 --> 02:33.433
-without asking who it is.
-Fine.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.700
Who is it?

02:38.767 --> 02:40.567
Detective Al Mullins, Miami P.D.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.300
Please, come in.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.734
Excuse my mother.
She's a little upset.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.667
She just found out she has the same
hairdresser as Whoopi Goldberg.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.133
This is my associate
Bobby Hopkins.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.667
Detective Mullins,
I am Blanche Devereaux.

02:59.734 --> 03:01.667
These are my roommates
Dorothy and Rose.

03:01.734 --> 03:03.800
They're innocent.
I'm not.

03:06.367 --> 03:10.500
You don't have to write that part.
That was just a come-on.

03:11.467 --> 03:14.233
I'm sorry to take up
your time at this hour,

03:14.300 --> 03:15.633
but I'd like to ask some questions.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.633
I'm single, free Saturday night,

03:19.700 --> 03:23.500
and can arch my back
until my head touches my heels.

03:25.266 --> 03:27.567
Al, I'd like to write that one down.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.600
Won't you sit down?

03:31.667 --> 03:34.700
I'd like to ask about your
neighbors the McDowell.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.433
They're not who you think.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.967
We invited the wrong people
to dinner?

03:40.834 --> 03:42.400
In a manner of speaking.

03:42.467 --> 03:46.033
Your next-door neighbors
are dealers in stolen gems.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.967
-Those sweet people?
-I'm afraid so.

03:50.033 --> 03:54.333
We believe they're
making a major move soon.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.867
We'd like to set up shop
here for a few days.

03:56.934 --> 03:58.133
Of course.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.767
You can both
stay in my room.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.700
Now wait just a minute.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.433
All right. You can have the boy.

04:08.567 --> 04:10.800
They can't just move in.

04:10.867 --> 04:14.600
Let them work from a van
like real police on TV.

04:16.266 --> 04:19.433
We'd like your cooperation,
but you have every right to say no.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.633
No.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.800
Girls, I think we need
to discuss this.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.900
If you'll just excuse us
for a moment.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.433
Ladies, we must do this.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.367
It's our duty as Americans.

04:34.433 --> 04:37.934
Two policemen living in our house?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.433
What's there to be afraid of?

04:39.500 --> 04:43.500
Strip away the gruff exterior,
the badge, the gun, the uniform...

04:43.567 --> 04:45.200
You've got a naked policeman.

04:46.967 --> 04:48.967
Exactly.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.600
Blanche, this is serious.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.767
If we can assist the police,
we should.

04:55.834 --> 04:58.000
Their job is hard enough.

04:58.066 --> 05:00.567
I should know.
My father was a policeman.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.834
I thought he was a farmer.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.533
On the weekdays.
Saturday and Sunday,

05:06.600 --> 05:10.066
he and the other farmers
became volunteer policemen.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.800
Of course,
the only crime in St. Olaf

05:11.867 --> 05:15.300
was more people didn't practice
better oral hygiene.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.333
So, most of the time,

05:18.400 --> 05:21.333
they sat around the jailhouse
taking pictures of each other

05:21.400 --> 05:23.700
behind the bars in goofy poses.

05:27.633 --> 05:28.633
I vote no.

05:28.700 --> 05:34.200
I agree. Why get involved in
something that might be dangerous?

05:34.266 --> 05:37.233
If it were dangerous, they wouldn't
let us get involved.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.734
Blanche has a point.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.667
Besides, if anything happens,
we've got the police with us.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.333
Maybe you're right.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.867
Then it's settled.
They can stay.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.367
(Blanche) Oh, detective Mullins,

05:50.433 --> 05:53.900
we decided you all can stay,
so welcome to our home.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.633
Thanks.
We appreciate this.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.066
We'll be back tomorrow
to set up.

05:58.133 --> 06:03.266
All we'll need is
a bedroom, a bathroom.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.767
We'll use the kitchen as a base.

06:04.834 --> 06:08.233
We'll cook in the fireplace
and pee in the broom closet.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.200
Al?

06:25.233 --> 06:27.800
-Al?
-Yeah.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.367
How'd you like the pasta?

06:29.433 --> 06:32.233
It's ok. I'm not crazy
about Italian food.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.700
You're lucky you carry a gun.

06:36.900 --> 06:37.567
Excuse me?

06:37.633 --> 06:41.000
I said,
these three days have been fun.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.867
-Hi, Sophia.
-Hi, Al.

06:45.934 --> 06:47.734
Hear anything
on the wiretap yet?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.500
He can't hear anything with
those things on his ears.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.133
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.300
I've been entertaining myself
all afternoon. Watch.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.934
Hey, you dumb bajagaloop.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.967
Your face looks like the rear
end of a donkey.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.700
This kills me! You try it.

07:09.066 --> 07:11.266
No, I will not.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.734
You shouldn't talk
to him like that, either.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.100
He's practically
your daughter's boyfriend.

07:16.166 --> 07:19.133
They hate each other.
They fight all the time.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.200
Very passionate fights.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.467
It has the signs of a classic
love/hate relationship.

07:24.533 --> 07:28.600
From the sparks of that conflict
rise the flames of desire,

07:28.667 --> 07:31.967
flames that ignite
in an uncontrollable frenzy of lust,

07:32.033 --> 07:33.867
passion and ecstasy!

07:40.600 --> 07:42.066
I'm sorry.
Where was I?

07:44.533 --> 07:46.100
I don't believe this.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.433
Hey, Dick Tracy.

07:48.266 --> 07:49.166
What's your problem now?

07:49.233 --> 07:54.066
I asked you to move this
where it wouldn't be in the way.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.867
I said I'd try. I tried.

07:55.934 --> 08:00.400
Also try to remember to put down
the toilet seat after you use it.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.166
Sorry. That was me.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.800
I experimented with something new,
but it didn't work out.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.667
Dorothy, he's only doing his job.

08:16.734 --> 08:19.133
It can't be very pleasant
for him, either.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.633
Actually, it's kind of nice here.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.066
I thought you couldn't hear.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.533
I do that for Sophia.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.967
She gets a kick
out of calling me names.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.066
She's really very sweet.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.967
She doesn't like to show it.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.500
Is that a family trait?

08:37.834 --> 08:40.400
You won't believe what happened
to me at the store.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.166
I saw the McDowell's.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.867
Luckily, they didn't see me,

08:43.934 --> 08:48.200
so I followed them and wrote down
everything they bought.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.000
Why?

08:50.066 --> 08:52.100
For evidence, silly.

08:52.166 --> 08:56.700
Rose, they steal jewels,
not Jeno's pizza rolls.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.700
Ladies, listen to me.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.500
It seems like we're
all in this together,

09:00.567 --> 09:04.700
but please leave
the police work to us.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.333
Ready for a break, Al?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.834
Thanks. I'm going out back.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.900
Won't the neighbors see you?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.367
It would look better
if someone were with me.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.533
Come on, dotty!

09:16.834 --> 09:18.200
What do you mean,
come on?

09:18.266 --> 09:21.066
If you want a favor, you ask me!

09:21.133 --> 09:23.233
Don't bite my head off!

09:23.300 --> 09:26.400
-You're a real charmer.
-Who are you, lady Di?

09:26.467 --> 09:29.567
-Come on!
-Join the bomb squad.

09:29.633 --> 09:32.100
Oh, God.
I'm crazy nuts about this guy.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.767
(doorbell rings)

09:50.400 --> 09:51.533
Hi, Rose.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.667
Ah!

09:53.767 --> 09:56.033
It's Martha McDowell,
your new neighbor.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.200
Ah!

09:58.533 --> 10:00.633
I was here for dinner,

10:00.700 --> 10:03.000
and yesterday you followed me
around the supermarket.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.033
Oh, my God.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.900
Why, Dorothy, look.
It's Mrs. McDowell.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.667
Why is everyone staring?

10:11.734 --> 10:14.700
Because your handbag
doesn't match your shoes.

10:17.066 --> 10:19.967
We're a very fashion-conscious
neighborhood.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.667
This is short notice,

10:22.734 --> 10:25.000
but would you all come
to dinner tomorrow?

10:25.066 --> 10:26.633
Ah!

10:28.367 --> 10:29.700
Oh. Hello.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.834
Hello. We haven't met.
I'm Martha McDowell.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.467
I see you've met my son
Alfonso and grandson Bobby.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.233
They're here fishing.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.800
Thus far,
all they've caught is a cold.

10:43.266 --> 10:45.200
Nice touch, but I work alone.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.367
Listen, I've got to run. Will you
let me know about dinner tomorrow?

10:51.433 --> 10:52.667
Bye.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.867
That was quick thinking.

10:56.934 --> 10:59.667
No big deal. I mistake a lot
of people for my grandson.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.066
-Did she invite you to dinner?
-Yes.

11:03.133 --> 11:04.900
-Al?
-No. It's too dangerous.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.400
It could break the case.

11:06.467 --> 11:08.834
What are you talking about?

11:08.900 --> 11:11.600
We need to plant
a bug in their house.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.300
It's not their job.

11:13.367 --> 11:16.100
We're not getting
zip on the phone.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.500
We've got to plant a bug.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.533
I'll be the plant.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.000
You are a plant.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.400
Honey, you don't do
too well under pressure.

11:27.467 --> 11:30.400
Remember the coffee shop
when you didn't have enough money,

11:30.467 --> 11:34.834
so you tried to climb out
the ladies' room skylight?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.266
That doesn't happen anymore
since I switched to decaf.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.900
I would volunteer,
but I'd be too conspicuous.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.433
It's a dinner party.
I plan to show cleavage.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.467
If anybody's doing it,
it should be me.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.667
-Why you?
-I'm the best under pressure.

11:53.734 --> 11:57.000
And she bears a striking resemblance
to Barnaby Jones.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.567
You've been tossing and turning.
What's bothering you?

12:12.633 --> 12:13.867
Nothing.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.800
Don't you break a commandment
in this room.

12:15.867 --> 12:16.767
What commandment?

12:16.834 --> 12:18.467
Thou shalt not toss and turn?

12:18.533 --> 12:20.467
No, thou shalt not lie.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.000
That's not a commandment.

12:22.066 --> 12:24.600
Really?
That doesn't make any sense.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.533
There's
"thou shalt not commit adultery"

12:27.600 --> 12:30.166
and "thou shalt not
cover thy neighbor's wife."

12:30.233 --> 12:32.066
Two out of ten refer to
hitting the sheets,

12:32.133 --> 12:33.700
and they couldn't fit in lying?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.734
Does anybody think before
they write this stuff down?

12:37.834 --> 12:39.500
Ma, you're not making
any sense.

12:39.567 --> 12:41.834
I can't talk to you
when you're half-asleep.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.667
Excuse me, it's only 4am.

12:43.734 --> 12:46.867
Get a rubber hose and whack me
around until I'm razor-sharp.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.800
Ma, I have a problem.
I'm worried about tomorrow.

12:51.867 --> 12:55.433
I don't know whether or not
I should go on that mission.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.567
Dorothy, for 50 years you've
come to me with your problems.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.233
"Who should I take to the prom?"

13:00.300 --> 13:01.633
"Where should I go to college?"

13:01.700 --> 13:03.400
"Do you think I should marry Stan?"

13:03.467 --> 13:05.166
These were things
I could help you with.

13:05.233 --> 13:08.066
"Should I go on this mission?"
Is out of my area of expertise.

13:08.133 --> 13:10.367
Who do you think I am, Oliver North?

13:12.033 --> 13:14.233
Ma, you're not making this
any easier.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.266
All right, then. If you think it'll
help you land Al, you should do it.

13:18.333 --> 13:21.100
Al? Who said anything
about landing Al?

13:21.166 --> 13:23.767
What, do you think
I'd risk my life for Al?

13:23.834 --> 13:26.633
I'm doing this because
I think it's the right thing to do.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.467
Because I'm a concerned citizen.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.934
And because
I'd give my right arm to land Al.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.700
I'm scared.
I don't know what to do.

13:33.767 --> 13:36.000
First of all, don't think
your problem is so unique.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.800
People do crazy things for love
all the time.

13:38.867 --> 13:41.033
Let me tell you a little story.

13:41.100 --> 13:45.233
Picture this, Sicily, August, 1908.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.200
No, that's not it.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.100
If you ever need a story about
jealousy, this one's a pip.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.900
Ma, just go to sleep.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.467
No, no, I remember.
Havana, 1957.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.533
No, I was never in Havana.

14:01.934 --> 14:04.900
-Ma.
-I meant Brooklyn, 1958.

14:06.033 --> 14:07.734
No, that's not it.

14:08.533 --> 14:10.166
I don't believe it.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.300
I'm dry. I got nothing.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.700
-It's okay, ma.
-No, it's not.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.100
I feel like Tommy Lasorda
should be standing by the bed

14:18.166 --> 14:20.300
waving to the bullpen.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.300
Ma, don't let it bother you.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.066
Well, I just can't leave you
hanging.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.367
In lieu of a story, would you settle
for a very wise observation?

14:27.433 --> 14:29.133
Yes, Ma.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.800
Al's a good guy.
And he makes you happy.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.567
And if you're doing it for that
reason alone, it's worth it.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.567
It's my guess that you're also
doing it because in your heart,

14:37.633 --> 14:39.166
you feel it's the right thing.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.200
Thanks, ma.

14:42.266 --> 14:43.500
That means a lot to me.

14:43.567 --> 14:44.834
Good.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.800
Now, get some rest, pussycat.

14:46.867 --> 14:48.567
Tomorrow could be your last day.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.000
It's a shame we have
to plant that transmitter.

15:05.066 --> 15:07.467
-There's a great movie on.
-What?

15:07.533 --> 15:08.734
<i>In cold blood.</i>

15:08.800 --> 15:12.667
It's about, this innocent family
is brutally murdered.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.667
-May I see that?
-Sure.

15:26.633 --> 15:27.900
Thank you.

15:28.567 --> 15:31.400
We're nervous enough
about the McDowell's.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.133
Do you have to make it worse?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.767
It's nothing to be nervous about.

15:35.834 --> 15:39.133
Bobby and Al are watching
through the kitchen window.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.633
If we have trouble,
we'll signal them.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.567
Well, how we doing, ladies?

15:44.633 --> 15:47.467
To be honest,
we're a little nervous.

15:47.533 --> 15:50.533
Let's go over the plan
one more time.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.767
Check.

15:51.834 --> 15:55.300
At 1800 hours,
we enter the suspect's domicile.

15:55.367 --> 15:58.500
At 1830 hours,
we sit down to dinner.

15:58.567 --> 16:02.400
After wine is poured,
at approximately 1840 hours,

16:02.467 --> 16:04.400
I tell the story about uncle Hertis

16:04.467 --> 16:06.200
and the three skunks
in the fountain,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.834
-which should last about--
-1900 hours.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.433
Dorothy,
here's the transmitter.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.533
Keep it in the palm
of your hand,

16:16.600 --> 16:20.000
then quickly stick it
under the table.

16:21.133 --> 16:25.066
-Are there any other questions?
-I guess that's it.

16:25.133 --> 16:26.000
Good luck, ladies.

16:26.066 --> 16:27.200
Let's go.

16:27.266 --> 16:29.000
Ma, you're not going.

16:29.066 --> 16:31.900
If anything goes wrong,
you need someone with experience.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.300
Experience with what?

16:33.367 --> 16:34.400
With life.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.700
You're looking at someone
who lived through two wars,

16:36.767 --> 16:38.734
15 vendettas,
4 major operations,

16:38.800 --> 16:40.900
and two Darrins on <i>Bewitched.</i>

16:46.500 --> 16:49.767
Sophia, those aren't
very good reasons to go.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.667
No? How about this,
I'm hungry. Let's roll, dano.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.400
Al, that's the front
door closing.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.467
The ladies are out of the house.

17:05.533 --> 17:08.367
The transmitter's working.
I hear everything clearly.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.700
They really did it.
I can't believe it.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.000
Bobby, I had big doubts
about this one.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.700
Congratulations, ladies.
You did a great job.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.367
-It's really working?
-Bobby, let her hear.

17:21.433 --> 17:24.166
You know, it was almost fun.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.533
Fun? My pulse was racing.
My heart was pounding.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.367
I could barely get my breath.

17:29.433 --> 17:32.200
That's the most fun
I've ever had standing up.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.266
No, I take it back.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.800
There was that one time
on that 747.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.066
They keep mentioning
"that noodlehead in the red dress."

17:47.133 --> 17:48.767
Could that be code language?

17:51.400 --> 17:54.100
Only to the noodlehead
in the red dress.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.934
Ok. What happens next?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.133
We'll get enough tonight
to get our warrants

17:59.200 --> 18:01.133
and be out of your lives tomorrow.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.834
I'm going to bed.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.100
-So am I.
-I'm too excited to sleep.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.367
No, you're not.
You're beat too.

18:08.433 --> 18:09.900
Oh, yeah. I'm beat too.

18:09.967 --> 18:14.800
I'm so beat, I won't hear
a thing that happens,

18:14.867 --> 18:17.834
but I'd like to
hear about it tomorrow.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.000
Bobby, go get some rest.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.000
Ok, Al.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.233
Dorothy, I just want to say...

18:30.567 --> 18:31.633
you did a nice job.

18:32.133 --> 18:32.900
Thanks, Al.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.300
Dorothy, I also wanted to say...

18:37.100 --> 18:38.033
that took guts.

18:39.066 --> 18:40.033
Thanks, Al.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.233
See, Dorothy,
I just wanted to ask you...

18:44.166 --> 18:45.133
I wanted to ask you,

18:45.200 --> 18:47.700
for God's sakes,
he wants to ask you out!

18:50.667 --> 18:53.300
You got your listening equipment,
I got mine.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.367
Good night.

19:01.667 --> 19:04.233
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

19:04.734 --> 19:08.633
Bobby, here's those extra towels
you asked for, hon.

19:08.700 --> 19:09.834
Thanks, Blanche.

19:09.900 --> 19:14.433
Listen, Blanche, before I forget,
I want to thank you for everything.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.033
You don't have to thank me
for anything.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.533
Actually, I enjoyed doing it.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.033
You remind me
of my son Matthew,

19:22.100 --> 19:23.967
except he doesn't carry a gun.

19:25.166 --> 19:28.233
Does your mama know
you carry that gun?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.367
I'm a grown man.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.433
I don't have to have
her permission,

19:32.500 --> 19:34.767
although she's not
thrilled about it.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.900
That's because she loves you.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.200
I'd be a wreck if Matthew
were a police officer.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.834
I worry about him already,
and he's a CPA.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.667
I guess that's just
a mother's nature.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.700
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

19:51.767 --> 19:54.967
Hey, Blanche, listen,
my mom lives in Oregon.

19:55.033 --> 19:57.633
I don't get many
home-cooked meals.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.400
Could I visit sometime?

19:59.467 --> 20:02.300
I think that would be great.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.867
Now, I don't care how old you are.
Lights out.

20:05.934 --> 20:06.967
Yes, ma'am.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.600
Ok.

20:10.033 --> 20:11.867
-Good night.
-Good night.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.500
Bobby, let's go!
The exchange is going down! Move it!

20:34.533 --> 20:35.400
What's going on?

20:35.467 --> 20:36.800
The McDowell's.
No time to explain.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.300
Just get on the floor
and stay there!

20:43.300 --> 20:44.500
I'm scared.

20:44.567 --> 20:47.467
-Me too.
-I'm scared for Al and Bobby.

20:47.533 --> 20:50.266
-Shh! What was that noise?
-That was me.

20:52.266 --> 20:54.633
Thank you for calling it
to everyone's attention.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.934
What's happening out there?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.433
-I hear something.
-I don't.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.000
-(gunshots)
-What's that?

21:10.066 --> 21:12.700
-Gunshots!
-Oh, boy!

21:12.767 --> 21:14.166
That could have been Al.

21:14.233 --> 21:17.967
-We have to do something!
-We have to wait till he returns.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.066
What if he can't?

21:21.100 --> 21:23.867
-Oh, thank God you're all right.
-Is everything ok?

21:23.934 --> 21:25.233
Just stay down.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.133
This is Mullins.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.500
Send an ambulance
and backup to the stakeout.

21:30.567 --> 21:31.567
My partner's been shot.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.367
At first, I was really scared.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.700
Then when I realized it was a
shoulder wound, then I calmed down.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.500
Actually, I passed out,
but I did it calmly.

21:51.667 --> 21:55.066
-Oh, Bobby, you're so brave.
-You're so stupid!

21:55.133 --> 21:57.367
You're supposed
to duck bullets.

21:57.433 --> 22:00.734
In Sicily, you can't pass
kindergarten till you learn that.

22:01.233 --> 22:04.734
Really? In St. Olaf, we just had
to promise not to eat paste.

22:05.633 --> 22:09.367
-All right, let's not baby him.
-How you doing?

22:09.433 --> 22:10.967
Great. The McDowell's were
arraigned.

22:11.033 --> 22:13.233
They'll be put away for years.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.367
Gee, who's going to
look after their lawn?

22:16.667 --> 22:20.033
Rose, while we're here, maybe
you should have a C.A.T. scan.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.166
Come on, out of bed.

22:23.233 --> 22:25.400
You got to take a ride
to the sun deck.

22:25.467 --> 22:27.333
Great. Who wants to drive?

22:27.400 --> 22:31.433
I'll do it. It's nice not to be
a passenger for a change.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.567
Tell me the whole story
all over again.

22:34.633 --> 22:38.367
-From the beginning?
-From the time you left...

22:41.266 --> 22:44.633
Dorothy, I
want to ask you something.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.500
How about you and
I go out sometime?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.166
Dorothy,
I really want to see you again.

22:49.667 --> 22:53.533
I want to see you again too,
but I can't.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.467
Why not?

22:54.533 --> 22:57.300
Because I could get
serious about you.

22:57.367 --> 23:00.400
I don't get it.
Until the other night,

23:00.467 --> 23:02.500
I thought this whole
thing was a game.

23:03.567 --> 23:05.800
After what happened,
I realized it isn't.

23:05.867 --> 23:08.533
You can't become involved
with someone who could get hurt

23:08.600 --> 23:10.166
whenever he's at work.

23:10.667 --> 23:11.967
I'm sorry.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.900
It's not the first time
I've heard it.

23:15.266 --> 23:16.000
I understand.

23:18.967 --> 23:22.800
Thanks. You take good care
of yourself, you hear?

23:25.667 --> 23:28.867
-So, are you two an item?
-No.

23:28.934 --> 23:31.800
We decided it was best
if we didn't see each other.

23:31.867 --> 23:33.367
You're sure?

23:33.433 --> 23:35.834
In your heart of hearts,
you're positive?

23:35.900 --> 23:36.567
Yes, ma.

23:36.633 --> 23:39.133
Fine. Then I want you
to meet someone. Dr. Tanzi...

23:41.800 --> 23:45.767
This is my daughter,
and this guy's nobody. Beat it, Al!

23:54.900 --> 23:58.533
(theme music playing)
