00:02.850 --> 00:03.750
First thing that the police

00:03.790 --> 00:04.860
Are going to try to do
is secure warrants.

00:04.890 --> 00:06.160
So, they're saying
kevin did this?

00:06.190 --> 00:07.360
I didn't do anything, man!
I didn't touch anybody!

00:07.390 --> 00:08.860
Stop it. Stop it!
They're always saying smack,

00:08.890 --> 00:10.220
Talking in accents,
calling us --

00:10.260 --> 00:12.000
You don't problem-solve
by beating on some kid.

00:12.030 --> 00:14.230
You have
a three-day suspension.

00:14.260 --> 00:16.059
We have an amazing event
coming up.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.070
It's going to raise $3 million.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.290
You're really
going through with that?

00:19.340 --> 00:20.570
Why wouldn't we?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.560
Personally, i'd want things
to settle down a little bit.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.080
There's a lot this school
is dealing with.

00:24.110 --> 00:25.110
You swore nothing happened.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.800
Well, something happened
at that party.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.900
The police are gonna start
making arrests.

00:28.950 --> 00:30.180
I messed up.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.310
Some booze,
some pills...

00:31.350 --> 00:33.020
I'm not
your problem anymore.

00:33.050 --> 00:35.090
Did you assault that boy?
I didn't rape him.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.520
He wanted to hook up.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.980
Those are texts and e-mails
your son and eric exchanged

00:39.020 --> 00:40.020
Before the party.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.830
Did you go there
to have sex with him?

00:41.860 --> 00:43.960
I didn't go there
to get attacked.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.430
4, 5, 6. 5, 6.

00:51.470 --> 00:54.270
It starts "r.U.H.?"

00:54.300 --> 00:56.800
It means "are you horny?"

00:56.840 --> 00:59.010
"i'm 'h.'

00:59.040 --> 01:01.300
Wish you could do something
about it."

01:01.340 --> 01:06.640
When we go at it, don't stop,
'cause i'm q2c."

01:06.680 --> 01:09.510
"q2c?"
what does that mean?

01:15.390 --> 01:17.050
What does "q2c" mean?

01:17.090 --> 01:18.320
No, stop.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.650
Ms. Blaine, would you like to
step outside and get some --

01:19.700 --> 01:20.700
No, no.
What does "q2c" mean?

01:20.730 --> 01:22.500
"quick to cum."

01:22.530 --> 01:25.430
You wrote those texts
to eric?

01:25.470 --> 01:28.410
The texts
about forced sex, rape...

01:28.440 --> 01:29.540
That was just talk.

01:29.570 --> 01:32.870
Was -- it was like
you were flirting?

01:35.140 --> 01:37.070
Yeah.
Who started the flirting?

01:37.110 --> 01:38.410
We both talked about it.

01:38.450 --> 01:40.220
So,
by the time you two --

01:40.250 --> 01:41.690
By the time you got together
at the party,

01:41.720 --> 01:43.690
He knew that's what
you liked?

01:48.090 --> 01:49.680
I-it...

01:49.730 --> 01:53.470
It was just something that i --
i could think about.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.770
I don't -- i don't...

01:54.800 --> 01:56.200
Had you ever previously

01:56.230 --> 01:58.430
Had a sexual experience
with another man?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.310
One other guy.

02:02.340 --> 02:04.280
This other guy,
did you tell him your fantasies?

02:04.310 --> 02:06.410
I never told anybody before.
Why eric?

02:06.440 --> 02:09.039
Because eric
made me feel safe.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.520
You went to this party.
You went to meet eric.

02:11.550 --> 02:12.620
I told you that.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.250
He knew you liked
aggressive contact.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.840
How is any of this rape?
He liked it, too.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.990
Because
i never said "yes!"

02:18.020 --> 02:19.280
I never got to say "yes."

02:19.320 --> 02:22.080
He gave me a drink.
I started to feel sick.

02:22.130 --> 02:24.900
I couldn't...
C-control myself.

02:24.930 --> 02:27.370
It was like i was...

02:27.400 --> 02:31.140
Like i was watching
this happen to me.

02:31.170 --> 02:34.740
It's like i had to --
to watch myself be...

02:34.770 --> 02:37.870
And -- and there's a door.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.140
There's a door right there,

02:39.180 --> 02:40.450
And there's -- there's people
on the other side.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.610
And they're right there,

02:41.640 --> 02:44.410
But they might as well be
a thousand miles away.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.550
And, look, i'm -- i'm --
i'm opening my mouth,

02:46.580 --> 02:50.010
And i'm trying to say something,
and i got a hand over.

02:50.050 --> 02:52.310
I got a hand i-in it.
I got something in it.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.630
And...

02:54.660 --> 02:57.260
Okay, it...

02:57.290 --> 03:01.220
It happened so fast,
but it -- it...

03:01.260 --> 03:03.260
It took forever to stop.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.400
And then he leaves me there.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.040
He walks out of the room,
and...

03:09.070 --> 03:13.300
He leaves me there to --
to crawl out.

03:13.340 --> 03:16.270
After the event...

03:16.310 --> 03:18.110
"want to see you.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.880
Wycm?"

03:19.920 --> 03:20.890
That means...?

03:20.920 --> 03:23.220
"will you call me?"

03:23.250 --> 03:26.010
Eric assaulted you,
but you still wanted to see him?

03:26.060 --> 03:29.530
I needed to see him.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.700
I needed, um...

03:31.730 --> 03:34.430
I needed him
to admit what he did.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.300
I think that's it for now.

03:37.330 --> 03:38.860
Are you going to
arrest anybody?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.200
We're still trying
to determine --
no, it wasn't consensual.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.040
He -- he was drugged.
He was raped.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.370
I mean,
h-his girlfriend was there.

03:44.410 --> 03:45.540
Evy was there.

03:45.580 --> 03:46.710
We're going to
interview her again.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.370
We're going to talk to
as many people as possible.

03:48.410 --> 03:50.210
I mean, he -- he --
he was assaulted.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.850
Then why did your son lie?
What were you afraid of?

03:55.850 --> 04:00.280
Everything you're putting
my mom through.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.320
-Captions by vitac

04:11.930 --> 04:14.900
Just kept getting more
and more intense, you know?

04:14.940 --> 04:19.279
Every text, every time he sent
me something, it was more.

04:19.310 --> 04:21.910
"i want you to hold me.
I want you to hold me down.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.740
I want you to hold me down
and choke me."

04:23.780 --> 04:26.080
So you planned
to get together?
Yeah.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.420
But it was kevin lacroix

04:27.450 --> 04:28.920
That invited taylor
to the party?

04:28.950 --> 04:30.250
Kevin runs the deal.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.260
We're both captains,
but, you know, he's the man.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.760
Kevin didn't know you were gay?
No.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.920
Why did you two
want to hook up at the party?

04:38.960 --> 04:42.920
It turned taylor on
to do it kind of public.

04:42.970 --> 04:44.270
Us getting off
while everybody else

04:44.300 --> 04:47.110
Is somewhere
getting stupid.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.110
Kind of...
Kind of turned me on, too.

04:49.140 --> 04:50.110
Did you drink?

04:50.140 --> 04:53.280
Uh, yeah,
but i wasn't drunk.

04:53.310 --> 04:55.450
How long were you both alone
in the room?

04:55.480 --> 04:56.780
15, 20 minutes.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.940
It was consensual?

04:58.980 --> 05:01.280
He was the one coming after me.
He was talking me through it.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.950
You know, "do this to him,
do that to him."

05:02.990 --> 05:05.160
And he was conscious
the entire encounter?

05:05.190 --> 05:06.660
He was buzzing,
but he knew what was going on.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.660
Did you provide him
with alcohol?
No.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.320
Did kevin
give him alcohol?

05:10.360 --> 05:11.660
I don't know.

05:11.690 --> 05:13.820
Did you offer him anything
to enhance the sex

05:13.860 --> 05:14.860
To make it feel better?

05:14.900 --> 05:17.700
I didn't need to.
He was into it.

05:17.730 --> 05:18.860
He was telling me
to hold him down,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.530
Telling me to choke him.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.540
And then he wants me
to unload.

05:22.570 --> 05:25.230
Soon as i do,
he starts freaking out.

05:25.270 --> 05:27.240
You know, gets all sad
and scared like some bitch

05:27.280 --> 05:28.550
Who's sorry
he got turned out.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.820
I don't need to hear that,
so i was out.

05:30.850 --> 05:35.820
And then later, right,
i hear he was pounding,

05:35.850 --> 05:37.810
Sparking it up,
acting stupid.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.810
I come back,
he's pants down,

05:39.860 --> 05:41.660
Ass up on the floor,
puking on himself.

05:41.690 --> 05:44.820
Everybody else
snapchatting his ass.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.000
I felt bad for him,
so i got him home.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.830
After he was incapacitated,
you were with him?

05:49.870 --> 05:52.840
His girl was in the car
the whole time.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.340
The whole time.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.000
And then the next day --
like, right the next day --

05:57.040 --> 06:00.350
He starts texting me like,
"oh, i want to see you.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.010
I want to talk."

06:02.040 --> 06:04.340
I didn't want anything
to do with him.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.180
That's when he started
popping off on how i raped him,

06:06.220 --> 06:08.190
After i didn't
want to give him any more.

06:08.220 --> 06:11.690
So i didn't rape him.
I did what he wanted.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.520
I'm sorry i ever went
anywhere near him.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.330
You don't seem sorry.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.010
Ready?

06:47.090 --> 06:51.830
Who was the...Other one?
Who was the...First one?

06:55.670 --> 06:59.200
Mark, when i was, um,
in eighth grade.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.710
He used to come over.

07:02.810 --> 07:05.780
How did it...Start?

07:07.210 --> 07:10.080
It just did.

07:10.110 --> 07:13.010
Well, did...
He do things to you?

07:13.050 --> 07:14.990
Did -- did you
do things to him?

07:15.020 --> 07:16.250
It was both of us.

07:16.290 --> 07:20.220
He used to sleep over.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.190
Never did anything
in the house.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.580
So that
makes it all right?

07:23.630 --> 07:25.330
As if
it wasn't in the house,

07:25.360 --> 07:27.460
Then whatever you were doing,
it's okay?

07:27.500 --> 07:31.400
If it was a girl,
you wouldn't care.

07:31.430 --> 07:32.990
If you can't tell me
what you were doing,

07:33.040 --> 07:34.270
Don't tell me
what i'm feeling.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.860
Eighth grade?
No, i would have cared.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.080
Did evy know
you liked boys?

07:50.950 --> 07:52.580
No.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.740
The e-mails,
being rough --

08:05.770 --> 08:08.510
Why do you want that?

08:08.540 --> 08:11.280
It's just stuff
i think about.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.940
Well,
did eric know that?

08:12.980 --> 08:15.910
Did he know
that it's just stuff?

08:44.870 --> 08:46.930
I just like
going monochromatic better.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.480
It -- it focuses your eye
on the subject,

08:49.510 --> 08:51.440
Rather than the world
around it.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.620
I mean, these are raw.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.090
I can -- i can put
color back in.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.690
No. No,
these are stunning.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.990
How's dan coping?

09:01.590 --> 09:04.800
Dan is, um --
dan is -- dan is dan.

09:04.830 --> 09:06.260
You know, he's...

09:06.300 --> 09:11.500
I think he -- he trusts that
everything's gonna work out.

09:11.530 --> 09:15.130
Uh, he doesn't tend
to confide in me,

09:15.170 --> 09:19.400
But i can tell he was affected
by eric's suicide attempt.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.050
His boys -- they're good kids.
They're strong kids.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.520
It's hard for all of them,

09:24.550 --> 09:27.150
With this accusation
hanging over their heads.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.110
I can only imagine
the anxiety

09:29.150 --> 09:32.710
As they're called in to speak
with the police.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.680
If dan were to have
a message for them,

09:36.730 --> 09:38.000
I would hope
that he would tell them

09:38.030 --> 09:40.600
To do what they know is right
in their hearts.

09:40.630 --> 09:41.930
Oh, sure.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.360
And -- and to be guided
by all the principles

09:44.400 --> 09:47.000
He's taught them --
unity, fidelity, loyalty.

09:47.040 --> 09:52.880
Those are the values that will
get us all through this.

09:52.910 --> 09:56.650
You want me to tell dan
to tell that to his players?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.080
I just think
it would be great

09:58.110 --> 10:00.880
If they could hear that
from dan.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.190
I hope you two
are still planning

10:03.220 --> 10:04.820
On attending the gala
this evening.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.650
However things --
however they work out,

10:06.690 --> 10:10.930
It's important for people
to know we are a community.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.000
Yes.

10:14.700 --> 10:18.140
Okay. Thank you.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.770
I don't know
what to do, man.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.600
I'm...I'm freaking out.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.740
And -- well,
you can't stress it, man.

10:24.770 --> 10:26.700
We're a team, man.
We're gonna do like a team.

10:26.740 --> 10:30.610
Police arrest me,
i...I could do like six years.

10:30.650 --> 10:32.250
That's not gonna happen.
You know that?

10:32.280 --> 10:37.480
Look, none of us are gonna say
anything to the police.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.290
So it's not
gonna happen, man.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.680
Stay strong, man.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.480
Yeah.

10:43.530 --> 10:45.030
Peace out.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.770
Hey, you, uh...

10:53.200 --> 10:55.760
You think it's gonna be
how they say?

10:55.800 --> 10:59.100
Like...You know,
everything is gonna be cool?

11:01.740 --> 11:05.440
I mean -- i mean,
it's just not the world i know.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.440
I'm just being real
with you.

11:10.150 --> 11:11.280
Hit me up.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.120
Yeah.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.030
And people say,
"you got to speak up.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.300
You got to say something.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.570
If you don't say something,
you're just a victim."

11:22.600 --> 11:23.900
But if you go online
for a minute,

11:23.930 --> 11:25.160
You look things up.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.440
Most times, assaults,
nobody ever gets arrested,

11:27.470 --> 11:30.580
Nobody --
nobody goes to jail.

11:30.610 --> 11:32.380
You don't feel you have
the right to say something?

11:32.410 --> 11:34.180
No, it's not about me.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.750
It's not --
it's not just about me.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.550
I have to watch
what they do to her.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.780
Your mother.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.420
What the police do to her,
how they treat her.

11:43.450 --> 11:47.480
And at school, she...

11:47.520 --> 11:49.280
She trusted them.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.930
And she went to them
for help.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.030
And she begged them...

11:54.060 --> 11:56.960
And, no, they --
they turned on her.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.270
They treat her
like a dog.

11:59.300 --> 12:04.170
And now it's -- it's just --
it's the same thing --

12:04.210 --> 12:05.310
Same thing
all over again.

12:05.340 --> 12:07.370
It's being made
to feel helpless.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.050
Speaking about
what happened,

12:09.080 --> 12:10.650
That doesn't make you feel
like you're fighting back?

12:10.680 --> 12:14.750
I feel more alone now
than when this started.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.550
Before, i...
I just wanted to run and hide,

12:17.590 --> 12:21.190
And now...I want...

12:23.490 --> 12:25.450
What do you want?

12:27.330 --> 12:30.230
Tell me what you did.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.270
Tell me what you did!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.400
I...Didn't do anything.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.870
You lied to me, right?

12:36.940 --> 12:39.180
You did that.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.650
I don't care
that you're gay.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.980
I'm not. I --

12:42.010 --> 12:44.610
Just be a man.
Okay?

12:44.650 --> 12:47.550
Tell the truth.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.980
I'm trying
to figure stuff out.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.760
You texted eric
about holding you down,

12:55.790 --> 12:58.150
About choking you.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.290
<i>You didn't have to figure
that out, right?</i>

13:00.330 --> 13:02.930
You knew how you wanted him
to grind on you.

13:02.970 --> 13:06.040
So how are you confused?
What are you confused about?!

13:06.070 --> 13:08.510
How i feel about you.

13:08.540 --> 13:12.310
When did you feel anything
about me?

13:12.340 --> 13:16.400
I see how you lied to me.

13:16.450 --> 13:18.750
I see how you'd get
a few beers in me,

13:18.810 --> 13:21.540
Tell me to hard-grind
on you some.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.850
Was i supposed to be
a boy to you?

13:24.890 --> 13:27.990
Is that why
you did me like that?

13:28.020 --> 13:31.450
Is that why you were
with me?

13:31.490 --> 13:34.290
Am i a boy to you?

13:54.550 --> 13:57.490
did you give me anything?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.460
Are you clean?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.280
I'm clean.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.250
How do you know?

14:04.290 --> 14:05.750
I got tested.

14:05.790 --> 14:08.060
You did it enough
you had to get tested?

14:08.100 --> 14:11.070
I just...

14:11.100 --> 14:12.870
I got tested.

14:12.900 --> 14:16.860
I stood up for you.

14:16.910 --> 14:21.880
Everybody else -- they cut you,
but i stood up!

14:21.910 --> 14:23.280
You want i should go
tell the police

14:23.310 --> 14:24.540
That you're
a lying piece of...

14:24.580 --> 14:25.850
Hmm?

14:25.880 --> 14:29.010
Do you want me to go and tell
them that you're a liar?

14:29.050 --> 14:32.350
Tell them i got drunk.

14:32.390 --> 14:35.030
Tell them i was just lying
on the ground,

14:35.060 --> 14:36.290
Kids taking my picture

14:36.330 --> 14:41.330
'cause i got down with a boy
and i had to get messed up.

14:43.730 --> 14:47.360
You tell them that.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.250
Where were you at the time
of the alleged event?

14:56.290 --> 14:58.690
I was by myself.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.480
Taylor was wherever.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.930
I wasn't having fun.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.690
The people at that party --
they were jerks.

15:08.730 --> 15:09.960
I just wanted to leave.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.370
There's been
new information

15:11.400 --> 15:14.230
About the intentions of both
young men that evening --

15:14.270 --> 15:16.370
Why taylor
went to the party,

15:16.410 --> 15:18.780
Why he separated himself
from you.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.910
Knowing that,
do you still believe

15:20.940 --> 15:24.840
Someone intentionally
incapacitated taylor blaine?

15:30.950 --> 15:32.210
Yes.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.030
Why?

15:34.060 --> 15:36.800
Because of
how he looked...

15:36.830 --> 15:38.760
How he acted.
Impaired?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.570
No.

15:40.630 --> 15:42.490
Scared...

15:42.530 --> 15:44.290
Hurt.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.730
And i thought i was getting
taylor into a car

15:46.770 --> 15:48.240
Away from whatever
was happening,

15:48.270 --> 15:51.970
But i put him into a car
with the kid who raped him.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.150
Do you know for a fact --

15:53.180 --> 15:54.810
You asked what i believe.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.450
Besides taylor,
you're the only person

15:56.480 --> 15:58.780
Who was at that party who's
claiming there was a rape.

15:58.820 --> 16:03.060
How many people have to say
it's a rape before you care?

16:08.930 --> 16:11.530
i should run this stuff
through the wash.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.790
You want to eat first?
What do you feel like?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.440
You want pizza...

16:16.470 --> 16:17.570
Or whatever?

16:17.600 --> 16:20.700
Where's peter?

16:20.740 --> 16:22.840
He's with your mother.

16:22.870 --> 16:26.300
They're gonna, uh --
they just went out some.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.150
I have got to get him on
this place when he gets back.

16:31.180 --> 16:32.110
I told him --

16:32.150 --> 16:35.590
Do you want to talk
about it?

16:35.620 --> 16:38.060
Well, we, uh --

16:38.090 --> 16:40.190
We've still got a lot
out in front of us --

16:40.220 --> 16:41.650
I mean, the police.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.620
You want to talk
about me being gay?

16:46.900 --> 16:48.630
When you're...

16:48.670 --> 16:50.970
Up to it, we can, uh...

16:53.440 --> 16:55.240
You know,
when you're ready.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.450
Come in.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.079
What you're doing is wrong.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.390
You're punishing us.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.880
You're profiling us.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.980
<i>Profiling you?</i>

17:16.030 --> 17:18.300
Why were mateo
and his friends expelled?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.930
That's not
your business.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.920
If it affects us,
then we have a right to know.

17:21.970 --> 17:24.069
Mateo was defending us.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.359
No, he wasn't.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.660
<i>He was defending
one of us.</i>

17:26.700 --> 17:29.770
Evy was being harassed.
Mateo was protecting her.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.780
S-she doesn't
deserve suspension.

17:31.810 --> 17:33.010
Those black boys do.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.970
There weren't "black boys"
in that fight.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.440
There was one black kid,

17:36.480 --> 17:37.920
And mateo and his friends
were beating on him.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.220
Well, what was happening
before that?

17:39.250 --> 17:41.520
What was happening before that
doesn't matter.

17:41.550 --> 17:43.180
if the black boys
were bullying evy?

17:43.220 --> 17:44.490
Stop saying "black boys."

17:44.520 --> 17:46.620
If they were being racist?
How you know he was?

17:46.660 --> 17:47.660
Do you know they weren't?

17:47.690 --> 17:49.950
I saw mateo
and his guys --

17:49.990 --> 17:51.390
<i>So it's about
what you saw?</i>

17:51.430 --> 17:53.730
Three kids
beating up on one boy.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.360
Don't come in here acting like
he was doing something right.
You weren't even there,
and you're blaming mateo.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.600
All mateo was doing
was acting like a thug!
He was standing up for evy,
and we're standing up for him!

18:05.310 --> 18:08.910
Said what you had to say.
It's done.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.630
Miss blaine?
Yes?

19:00.660 --> 19:01.860
Detective krasno.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.340
I'm calling to let you know
that based on what we know,

19:04.370 --> 19:06.140
The county prosecutor
is not bringing charges

19:06.170 --> 19:07.640
In your son's case
at this time.

19:07.670 --> 19:10.270
I'm sorry. "at this time"?
If there's new information,

19:10.310 --> 19:11.580
We'll give you a call
as soon as we know something.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.210
Wait, y-you're not
doing anything?

19:13.240 --> 19:14.370
Based on what we know,

19:14.410 --> 19:17.010
The county prosecutor is not
going to bring charges.

19:17.050 --> 19:20.650
If there's anything new,
we'll be in touch.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.280
Hello?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.760
Miss blaine?

19:24.790 --> 19:28.190
the police called.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.630
They're not gonna --

19:30.660 --> 19:32.100
There are not
gonna be any charges.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.270
They're not gonna
arrest anybody.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.530
So...It's done.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.370
I need to know from you that --
that this is over,

19:49.410 --> 19:52.670
That you're done putting us
through this.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.360
Okay.

20:01.790 --> 20:04.020
It's the decision
of the county prosecutor

20:04.090 --> 20:05.950
Not to move forward
with any charges.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.930
So, kevin
has been cleared?

20:08.970 --> 20:10.440
He hasn't been cleared
of any involvement,

20:10.470 --> 20:12.910
But the county prosecutor
isn't bringing charges.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.070
He's still a suspect?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.700
Your son, anyone connected
to the allegations

20:16.740 --> 20:18.340
Would only be charged
if new or additional --

20:18.380 --> 20:21.310
Is he still a suspect?
Please just say what you mean.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.800
Will you tell her to answer me?
Are -- are you --
are you charging our son,

20:22.850 --> 20:23.780
Or are you not?

20:23.810 --> 20:25.270
You either are
or you aren't.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.950
This is not
moving forward,

20:26.980 --> 20:29.750
But the county prosecutor
wants to reserve the right to --

20:29.790 --> 20:31.760
So you're going to
just do that to kevin.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.890
Look, we need to --
you're gonna leave
this over him.

20:34.930 --> 20:38.260
He deserves better.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.760
I understand
your wife's upset.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.200
I hope you can
help her understand

20:44.230 --> 20:45.790
That we're being as thorough
as we can.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.610
Hey. Terri -- she's fierce.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.040
Yes, she --
she really is.

20:50.070 --> 20:53.340
But please do not mistake me
for being the reasonable one,

20:53.380 --> 20:55.680
Especially when it comes
to our son.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.210
Yes.

21:25.510 --> 21:28.810
Mr. Dixon?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.950
Go for dixon.

21:30.980 --> 21:34.210
There's a problem
out in front of the school.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.510
What problem?

21:35.550 --> 21:37.480
<i>no somos matones!</i>

21:37.520 --> 21:38.780
<i>No somos matones!</i>

21:38.820 --> 21:40.250
<i>No somos matones!</i>

21:40.290 --> 21:41.880
<i>No somos matones!</i>

21:41.930 --> 21:43.360
<i>No somos matones!</i>

21:43.390 --> 21:44.820
<i>No somos matones!</i>

21:44.860 --> 21:46.790
<i>No somos matones!
We are not thugs!</i>

21:46.830 --> 21:49.900
<i>No somos matones!
No somos matones!</i>

21:51.240 --> 21:52.510
Want me to call the police?
Mnh-mnh.

21:52.540 --> 21:53.810
Let them burn it off.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.310
If they're out here
tomorrow,

21:55.340 --> 21:57.580
We can start handing out
discipline notices.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.050
<i>No somos matones!
No somos matones!</i>

21:59.080 --> 22:02.080
It has to be
about forgiveness.

22:02.110 --> 22:04.040
While everyone else
rushed to judgment,

22:04.080 --> 22:08.210
We remained steadfast in support
of our two accused students --

22:08.250 --> 22:09.850
One black, one gay.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.320
Let other people
defend their bias.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.290
That already puts us
in the lead.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.420
Eric tanner's return
has to be a display

22:15.460 --> 22:16.900
Of acceptance on our part.

22:16.930 --> 22:19.500
Our families --
this isn't san francisco.

22:19.530 --> 22:20.570
Nobody is trying to deal

22:20.600 --> 22:22.700
With having a gay kid
on a sports team.

22:22.730 --> 22:24.630
We start calling those people
out as homophobes,

22:24.670 --> 22:26.110
They start to pivot.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.740
You want us to call our families
bigots and homophobes?

22:28.770 --> 22:30.530
We let the students do it.

22:30.570 --> 22:33.640
We have any number of them
who are progressive, vocal.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.120
We promote their voices.

22:36.150 --> 22:37.120
We've got a block

22:37.150 --> 22:39.050
Of fundamentalist families
to deal with.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.690
We don't have to change
what they believe.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.320
What we have to change is
how they perceive the issue.

22:43.350 --> 22:44.550
Make it about forgiveness.

22:44.590 --> 22:47.330
Make it about things
that are central to them.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.260
Don't push any actual acceptance
of eric's lifestyle.

22:50.290 --> 22:52.390
Stick to the tolerance
for it.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.130
What about
our black families?

22:54.160 --> 22:55.560
I mean,
we put a lot behind eric.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.840
They're gonna expect the same
for kevin.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.940
It's not gonna take
the same effort with kevin.

22:58.970 --> 22:59.940
It's just not.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.070
We've done any number of things

23:01.110 --> 23:02.710
In support of
the lacroix family.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.010
And to be honest,
we only have

23:05.040 --> 23:07.270
Three black families
who pay full tuition.

23:07.310 --> 23:11.510
They're not gonna raise the same
concerns the same way.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.690
Beyond that, we talk publicly

23:13.720 --> 23:15.150
About how we've learned
from this,

23:15.190 --> 23:17.120
What reforms
we're implementing,

23:17.150 --> 23:18.750
But it's about making
the message

23:18.790 --> 23:20.290
As simple as we can.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.220
The other boy lied.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.660
Ours told the truth.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.140
We start preaching that
with our event tonight.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.530
Yeah.
Well...It's not over.

23:33.570 --> 23:34.670
Oh.

23:34.710 --> 23:38.240
But i think we're putting it
behind us.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.410
Thank you, leslie.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.200
Oh, my goodness.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.380
Good job.
Thank you.

23:43.410 --> 23:44.340
Very grateful.

23:44.380 --> 23:47.780
Oh, my god.
To you, to you.

24:01.370 --> 24:03.640
i don't know why.

24:03.670 --> 24:04.840
Just made me feel...

24:09.270 --> 24:11.200
Why was aunt sarah crying?

24:11.240 --> 24:13.340
Okay, don't -- don't say
anything to your father.

24:13.380 --> 24:14.380
Okay?

24:14.410 --> 24:18.810
Um, sarah went out
to get a coffee,

24:18.850 --> 24:23.720
And some guy started
talking to her...Ab--

24:23.750 --> 24:25.510
Well, you know,
he just started talking to her.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.330
And he was --
he was interesting, i guess.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.490
She thought he was.

24:28.530 --> 24:32.400
And before she left,
he gave her his number.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.370
She cheated
on uncle charlie?

24:34.400 --> 24:39.440
No, no. She didn't call the guy,
but she kept the number.

24:39.470 --> 24:42.370
Well -- well, it -- you know,
it didn't feel good to her.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.340
She didn't do anything.

24:44.370 --> 24:46.800
I know,
but it didn't feel right.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.570
But then why did
she keep the number?

24:49.610 --> 24:51.540
That's stupid.
Stop it.

24:51.620 --> 24:56.120
No, it's stupid to feel bad
about something you didn't do.

24:56.150 --> 24:58.080
You know what?
You're 17, and you don't get it.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.720
then what?

24:59.760 --> 25:03.000
<i>I mean, feeling bad about stuff
you don't do.</i>

25:03.030 --> 25:04.430
No, she feels guilty.

25:04.460 --> 25:07.760
<i>But you have to do something
before you can feel guilty.</i>

25:07.800 --> 25:10.040
No, you can...

25:10.070 --> 25:13.010
<i>You have to care
about something.</i>

25:13.040 --> 25:14.170
Then you can
feel guilty.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.700
All right, whatever.

26:14.230 --> 26:15.420
Are you gay?

26:17.500 --> 26:20.960
Mom said that's why you tried
to kill yourself.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.600
She said that you're gay

26:23.640 --> 26:25.740
And that's why you tried
to kill yourself.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.250
She can't deal with it.

26:29.350 --> 26:30.480
Peter, i'm --

26:30.510 --> 26:31.540
You're an ass...

26:59.880 --> 27:03.110
Sometimes i like to look
at you from across the room...

27:04.790 --> 27:10.460
...And i think, "if i
didn't know this girl...

27:10.490 --> 27:12.920
Would i still
fall in love?"

27:15.500 --> 27:18.440
What's the answer?

27:21.740 --> 27:24.140
"yes."

27:24.180 --> 27:26.780
"yes."

27:32.880 --> 27:36.280
How would you feel
about leaving the school?

27:36.320 --> 27:41.860
Uh, about me
leaving the school?

27:41.890 --> 27:45.590
This whole thing has been...
A mess.

27:45.630 --> 27:49.540
How they've handled it
was a mess.

27:49.570 --> 27:51.800
You spent -- you spent six years
building your program,

27:51.840 --> 27:54.110
And they just -- they --
they screwed it.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.740
Leave and do what?

27:55.770 --> 27:57.030
Go to another school.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.970
Go to be an assistant
at a college.

28:00.010 --> 28:02.280
No.

28:02.310 --> 28:03.870
It's not gonna work
here anymore.

28:03.910 --> 28:07.810
Look, this thing, it --
it's not gonna last.

28:07.850 --> 28:10.250
All right, the -- the --
the school, the team --

28:10.290 --> 28:12.360
They're gonna get past
all this.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.960
You're not gonna
work here anymore.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.920
You tell me what you think
when you look at me.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.470
I look at you,
and i see a man --

28:23.500 --> 28:27.910
A good man --
who's in over his head.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.310
Happy birthday.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.450
Hey, w-why are you mad?
Why are you mad?

28:35.480 --> 28:36.920
Because i'm telling you
you're good?

28:36.950 --> 28:39.790
Look, y-you're not using that
as a compliment. All right?

28:39.820 --> 28:42.290
That's like breaking up with me
'cause -- 'cause my...Too big.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.560
All right?
Don't get profane.

28:43.590 --> 28:45.520
Yeah, well, if -- if one of us
is slinging stuff...

28:45.560 --> 28:48.130
This -- this thing --
it tore your boys up.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.460
It tore you up.
And -- and this -- this stuff

28:49.490 --> 28:50.420
Doesn't happen in college?

28:50.460 --> 28:52.050
In college,
they have rules.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.900
Hmm? Yeah, okay.
They have procedures.

28:53.930 --> 28:57.360
Yeah.
I'm not leaving leyland.

29:02.070 --> 29:05.470
Our daughter doesn't know
what love is.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.780
What?

29:06.810 --> 29:08.610
Becca came to me.

29:08.650 --> 29:10.080
She -- she doesn't know
what love is...

29:10.110 --> 29:11.040
Yeah, she's 17.
...Or commitment.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.680
She doesn't know
what guilt is.

29:13.850 --> 29:16.950
Are you --
a-are you on your candy?

29:16.990 --> 29:18.390
Oh. Why?

29:18.420 --> 29:20.850
Because the only time
i have anything to say

29:20.890 --> 29:22.650
Is when i'm high
or i'm hysterical?

29:22.690 --> 29:25.620
I don't know, because you're
going from how i'm too nice

29:25.660 --> 29:27.260
To how becca
doesn't understand love.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.400
Love --
i mean, that's how --

29:28.430 --> 29:30.030
That's how people sound
when they're high.

29:30.070 --> 29:33.470
Love...And commitment.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.730
They're hard.

29:36.770 --> 29:39.340
Right?
Talking about them is hard.

29:39.380 --> 29:41.310
And you don't have
hard conversations.

29:41.350 --> 29:42.580
You -- you -- you know,

29:42.610 --> 29:44.210
You always lead with trust
and with honesty and --

29:44.250 --> 29:45.690
Oh, and that's --
that's wrong, huh?

29:45.720 --> 29:47.690
That's wrong?
And you tell your boys
to be good, right?

29:47.720 --> 29:49.620
You tell them
to do right.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.250
And that's always worked,
you know,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.890
Because -- because nobody ever
had to put it to the test.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.820
But -- but the first chance
they get to lie --

29:56.860 --> 30:00.600
To really, really lie...

30:00.630 --> 30:02.390
I mean, they could --
they could have come to you.

30:02.430 --> 30:03.530
Yeah.
But they didn't.

30:03.570 --> 30:04.640
Let's stop.

30:04.670 --> 30:05.940
Because it doesn't stick
with these people.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.410
You know, it's --
look, it's so --

30:07.440 --> 30:09.740
It's just --
it's so easy to be cynical.

30:09.770 --> 30:12.000
That whole school
is cynical.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.140
Every step, it was,
"go down there,

30:14.180 --> 30:16.950
Go to those kids,
you know, make them confess."

30:16.980 --> 30:20.210
You know, next thing, i'm
standing in a hospital over eric

30:20.250 --> 30:22.020
Because he tried
to kill himself.
That wasn't your fault.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.150
<i>Well, i gave in,
and that was my fault.</i>

30:24.190 --> 30:25.960
All right?
It's --

30:25.990 --> 30:28.260
I gave in as a -- as a --
as a coach,

30:28.290 --> 30:30.050
As a friend,
and eric almost died.

30:30.090 --> 30:32.360
So, when people,
they start coming to me,
telling me what to do...

30:32.400 --> 30:33.830
Well, they're not your wife.
But i got no need for it.

30:33.860 --> 30:34.990
What, i don't have a right
to talk to you?

30:35.030 --> 30:36.790
Not when it comes to my team --
all right? --

30:36.830 --> 30:37.960
Or what i do for them
or how i do it.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.130
So, what am i
supposed to do?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.710
I'm just supposed to stand
around and cheer for you?

30:40.740 --> 30:41.870
Okay, look, i know --
because you already
have those people.

30:41.910 --> 30:43.510
I-i know this is
your birthday.

30:43.540 --> 30:44.810
I -- it was hard for me,
too, this one.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.800
Stop.
You're dismissing me.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.250
Look, for whatever --
whatever reason,

30:49.280 --> 30:50.980
You -- you want to get
into it with me.

30:51.020 --> 30:52.790
You want me to throw
some punches.
No, i'm -- i'm not
trying to hit you.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.190
All right,
well, what do you want?
What the...Do you want?

30:54.220 --> 30:55.690
You want me to stand here
and spew...

30:55.720 --> 30:57.820
So you can feel good
about the guy you married?

30:57.860 --> 30:59.160
Huh?

31:06.400 --> 31:10.470
Leslie wanted me
to tell you...

31:10.500 --> 31:13.960
To tell your boys to lie
to the police.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.770
She wanted me to tell you
to give them

31:16.810 --> 31:19.580
One of your little talks...

31:19.610 --> 31:21.850
About fidelity...

31:21.880 --> 31:23.550
And unity.

31:40.660 --> 31:42.120
I don't know
what she wanted,

31:42.170 --> 31:43.940
But i never would have
told them to lie.

31:43.970 --> 31:49.510
But have you ever really tried
to find out the truth?

31:49.540 --> 31:51.310
The truth...

31:51.340 --> 31:53.770
Isn't cynical.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.400
I...

31:55.450 --> 31:59.520
I just -- i want something
better for you...

31:59.550 --> 32:01.990
And better
for our daughter.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.290
Becca has us.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.420
Those -- those boys --
they need me.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.590
You know, and you --

32:07.620 --> 32:10.050
T-they need somebody like you,
too, at that school.

32:10.090 --> 32:13.060
Yeah,
documenting the sins.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.700
I'm not leaving them.

32:33.450 --> 32:36.960
Then we better get ready to go
to this thing tonight.

32:39.060 --> 32:42.060
Leslie really wants you to go
to this thing.

32:56.030 --> 32:57.130
We have to go.
You know that, right?

32:57.170 --> 32:58.440
So the haters can hate?

32:58.470 --> 33:00.710
Haters gonna hate regardless,
honey.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.370
That's all they have
for themselves.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.480
i know this hurts.

33:04.510 --> 33:07.110
But there hasn't ever been
one thing that we've ever done

33:07.140 --> 33:08.400
Or not done
where we were worried

33:08.440 --> 33:11.140
About what other people
were gonna say.

33:11.180 --> 33:14.550
So...Tonight...

33:14.580 --> 33:16.540
You and me...

33:16.590 --> 33:19.160
Heads high...

33:19.190 --> 33:21.930
Looking fine
and undefeated.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.000
That's how we start to get
our son's name back.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.100
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:28.130 --> 33:30.060
There are any number
of pleasures

33:30.100 --> 33:33.000
That come with being on the
board of directors of leyland,

33:33.040 --> 33:36.510
But none greater than presenting
the head, heart,

33:36.540 --> 33:40.750
And soul of our school,
dr. Leslie graham.

33:53.390 --> 33:57.300
To all our friends,
families, and donors

33:57.330 --> 34:01.900
Who helped make tonight's
performance possible, thank you.

34:01.930 --> 34:04.830
We have a long history
of academic excellence

34:04.870 --> 34:06.300
Here at leyland.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.770
In recent days,

34:08.810 --> 34:11.280
Although this entire community
has been challenged,

34:11.310 --> 34:16.750
I am happy to say our future
has never been more assured.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.520
We are so proud
of all of our students,

34:19.550 --> 34:23.389
Who showed everyone what we
at leyland already know --

34:23.420 --> 34:26.960
Real men stand up
for each other.

34:26.989 --> 34:30.230
Real men stand up for what
they believe in.

34:30.260 --> 34:35.330
And most importantly,
real men tell the truth.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.760
Thank you,
and enjoy your evening.

39:20.980 --> 39:24.210
I just need to speak
to the manager, anne blaine.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.720
Yeah? I'm anne.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.330
Hi, my name is james.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.300
Is there somewhere
we can...Talk?

39:36.470 --> 39:38.870
Our daughter
was a student at leyland.

39:38.900 --> 39:41.160
It's been
about six years now.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.230
What -- what happened?

39:44.270 --> 39:48.800
She was having problems
with one of the teachers.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.240
She was being harassed.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.550
S-she was being touched?

39:52.580 --> 39:55.980
No, no.
No, it was verbal.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.290
The teacher would say
things to her --

39:57.320 --> 39:59.590
Just the --
the most lewd things.

39:59.620 --> 40:02.050
We -- we couldn't get anybody
at leyland to pay attention,

40:02.090 --> 40:03.990
To do anything.

40:04.030 --> 40:06.630
Finally, we sent our daughter
to school with a --

40:06.660 --> 40:09.720
One of those little
pocket recorders.

40:09.770 --> 40:12.970
You got him on tape?
Did you bring it to the school?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.100
They said we didn't
have the right

40:15.140 --> 40:18.540
To record conversations
on school property.

40:18.570 --> 40:20.670
And they suspended
my daughter for a week,

40:20.740 --> 40:23.740
Started spreading rumors
about her to the faculty.

40:23.780 --> 40:26.380
After that,
the response was just brutal.

40:26.420 --> 40:29.850
The whole school -- teachers,
some of the parents.

40:29.890 --> 40:32.620
They turned against you.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.430
We tried to sue.

40:35.460 --> 40:38.230
My wife couldn't take
the legal battles.

40:38.260 --> 40:41.200
And it was just gonna get a lot
worse before it got better.

40:41.230 --> 40:45.970
So...We ended up taking
a settlement.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.930
Felt like
the right thing to do.

40:48.970 --> 40:51.100
But it wasn't.

40:51.140 --> 40:53.280
<i>It was the easy thing
to do.</i>

40:53.310 --> 40:56.280
Say something to somebody.
Tell somebody what happened.

40:56.310 --> 40:59.610
Can't.
I signed an agreement.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.790
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

41:01.820 --> 41:04.060
Well, then why are you?

41:04.090 --> 41:10.230
I heard the police aren't
going forward with your case.

41:10.260 --> 41:15.230
But something's got to be done
about that school.

41:16.305 --> 41:22.258
