you tired already?

07:53.406 --> 07:55.576
- I only came along
to make you happy.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.387
- Yeah?

07:58.411 --> 07:59.889
What about James?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.625
You guys can't live
without each other.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.826
- Ah very funny.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.417
Go on, switch it off.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.038
Oh it's James.

08:15.062 --> 08:15.772
- Huh?

08:15.796 --> 08:16.864
- It's James.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.010
Alright, let's go.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.837
They've already
pitched their tent.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.251
- Hey!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.361
- Oh my god, look Sheila.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.407
It's amazing.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.465
- Wow.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.870
Oh my god it's beautiful.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.731
Tom, come on, we're late.

09:47.755 --> 09:48.755
- I know.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.423
Who cares?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.338
- We're late.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.040
Later.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.231
Okay?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.783
- Tom.
- What's wrong?

10:06.807 --> 10:13.422
- Look.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.859
- It looks like a crazy woman.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.127
- She's mad.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.439
- Stop, shh, she can hear you.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.265
- She's completely mad.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.292
- She must have escaped
from a hut house.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.395
- Oh, they're not answering.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.368
Whoa!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.077
James!

12:27.948 --> 12:29.416
- Guys?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.286
- James.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.988
Nadine.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.556
- Jessica.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.428
- These woods aren't safe.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.354
You can't stay here.

13:09.556 --> 13:13.693
- We were meant to meet some
friends here, in this clearing.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.808
- Pack up your tents.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.000
And leave.

13:22.669 --> 13:26.874
- Look, we've walked four
hours to get here, so.

13:28.241 --> 13:32.846
- So you can walk another
four, to get back.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.615
- We're just waiting
for our friends.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.685
- He's probably
already taken them.

13:40.753 --> 13:41.855
- He?

13:43.756 --> 13:45.758
- They call him Little Sister.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.661
And he'll rip off your face.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.308
And as for you, little girl,

13:52.332 --> 13:55.568
if you're lucky
you'll die quickly.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.746
- Little Sister?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.283
- Don't be fooled by his name.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.255
You have to leave.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.556
Now.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.561
- Okay, crazy ax man.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.969
Why aren't you afraid?

14:31.972 --> 14:35.275
- Because I have my
little sister here.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.448
And my name is Ben.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.234
- So we aren't dead.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.470
Some mad woman.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.714
Ax men, little sisters.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.183
- Um, I like it.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.609
- Of course you do.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.980
- Our own maniac.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.793
Ready to kill us, any second

15:22.589 --> 15:26.602
Who knows how they managed
to bump off James.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.040
- Do you think we
should be worried?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.184
- Look at their text.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.556
They must have copped out.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.937
- Did you call him?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.764
- I tried, but there
was no signal.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.236
- Hmm.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.205
What a shame.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.664
What was that?

17:12.832 --> 17:14.032
- No idea.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.805
- Who's there?

17:59.346 --> 18:00.780
T-Tom?

18:48.595 --> 18:50.129
Tom, where are you?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.151
Tom?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.277
Where are you?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.815
- It was this branch.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.394
It fell on the tent.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.418
- Tom.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.630
- What?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.423
- What are you doing?

20:23.990 --> 20:24.991
- Nothing.

20:25.629 --> 20:27.069
- Come on, let's go
back in the tent.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.160
- Okay.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.229
Strange though.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.144
- What was strange?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.747
- What?

20:50.016 --> 20:53.596
- When you went outside, you
said something was strange.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.722
What was it?

20:59.926 --> 21:04.597
- The branch was cut with an ax.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.344
Don't worry.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.279
I can guard tonight,
if you like.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.028
- Tonight?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.153
- Sure.

21:28.988 --> 21:32.167
As long as Little Sister
doesn't come real close.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.947
- I told you to leave.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.225
- Fucking hell Ben.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.969
You scared us, it's the
middle of the night.

21:58.993 --> 22:00.294
What are you doing?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.591
- Your friends?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.258
- We don't know.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.672
- What the fuck?

27:16.635 --> 27:17.635
- Igor!

28:06.796 --> 28:07.796
- Dad.

28:07.820 --> 28:08.764
Dad, what's going on?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.489
Dad what's happening?

28:11.223 --> 28:12.701
Dad, talk to me.

28:12.725 --> 28:13.725
Dad!

28:15.461 --> 28:17.339
No, look what you've done.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.875
Look what you've
done, you bitch.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.167
- Hello?

32:40.726 --> 32:42.361
Tom?

32:43.395 --> 32:44.796
Tom.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.100
Tom it's me.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.775
Come on.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.144
It's okay, it's okay.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.343
Tom, come on, quickly.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.367
He's coming.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.959
Tom.

38:51.597 --> 38:52.698
Tom?

38:54.433 --> 38:56.110
Tom come on, come on.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.803
Get up, come on.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.847
- Sheila you have to go.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.773
- No, I can't leave you.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.876
- Save yourself.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.083
Go Sheila!

40:11.710 --> 40:12.710
- Ben.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.914
Little Sister.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.383
- I warned you.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.893
It's not what you think.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.699
Let me help you.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.100
- I'm fine.

40:38.069 --> 40:41.115
- I release animals from
the poachers traps.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.208
I'm not here to harm you.

40:46.612 --> 40:50.516
We need to get to the
Borgstrum farm, it's nearby.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.337
- Okay, you go ahead.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.462
I'll go behind.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.123
How far is it?

41:56.147 --> 41:59.417
- 20 minutes, 30 at the most.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.295
And your boyfriend?

42:01.319 --> 42:05.123
- I left him in the
woods to get help.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.858
Why have we stopped?

42:08.093 --> 42:11.496
- So now you believe
in Little Sister.

44:00.215 --> 44:01.215
- Nadine!

44:01.239 --> 44:02.774
What, you're alive?

45:44.742 --> 45:45.911
- Where is Tom?

46:04.329 --> 46:05.831
- Where's James?

46:23.849 --> 46:27.094
- We have to go back
to get a weapon.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.686
- No, that's crazy.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.521
- What shall we do?

46:36.761 --> 46:38.796
- It's safer in the woods.

46:39.464 --> 46:40.698
- You're right.

46:41.732 --> 46:42.732
- Come on.

46:43.434 --> 46:44.434
Shh.

47:09.694 --> 47:11.462
Nadine, no!

47:17.936 --> 47:19.137
No, no Nadine.

49:46.684 --> 49:47.752
Tom.

56:00.991 --> 56:02.026
- Hang on.

56:10.468 --> 56:14.104
This is not your little sister.

56:17.174 --> 56:18.476
Daddy is not happy.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.650
Nadine, it's me.

56:49.674 --> 56:50.674
- Sheila!

56:55.946 --> 56:57.247
Sheila!

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.009
- No.

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:54.320
No, no!

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:55.344
Stop.

01:01:56.613 --> 01:01:57.614
No.

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:11.421
Nadine's not dead.

01:03:13.234 --> 01:03:14.234
No.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:16.026
Look what you've done.

01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:19.229
Look what you've done here.

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:17.033
- Erika, not now.

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.006
- Boo!

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.555
Oh come on.

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:36.589
Stop it.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:12.948
Igor!

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:02.708
- Dad.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:03.443
Dad, what's going on?

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:05.068
Dad, what's happening?

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:07.447
Dad, talk to me.

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:08.471
Dad!

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:11.951
No, look what you've done.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.844
Look what you've
done, you bitch!

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.746
