00:12.103 --> 00:14.412
Oh! Good morning, Dr Crane.

00:15.859 --> 00:20.091
Not a morning person, are we?
Never you mind - I am.

00:20.450 --> 00:24.125
A good health care provider
is up with the cock.

00:25.876 --> 00:29.266
I've taken your father
for his morning constitutional.

00:29.590 --> 00:33.503
A remarkable man.
30 years on the police force.

00:33.847 --> 00:36.486
I see why you'd want him to live here.

00:36.769 --> 00:40.728
Not many sons would do that,
not without getting paid.

00:41.068 --> 00:44.822
Coffee's made
and I took the liberty of doing a shop.

00:45.157 --> 00:48.149
They don't serve tripe in Seattle,
do they?

00:50.166 --> 00:52.236
And you are..?

00:54.089 --> 00:57.764
Daphne. Daphne Moon.
I moved in yesterday.

00:58.096 --> 01:00.610
You hired me to look after your father.

01:00.892 --> 01:04.328
Sorry. I'm not myself
until I've shaved and showered.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.607
I understand
about one's morning ablutions.

01:08.947 --> 01:13.225
I can't stand meself before
I floss all that gunk out of me teeth.

01:13.579 --> 01:15.934
Miss Moon...

01:16.209 --> 01:21.806
Keep your ablutions on a need-to-know
basis. Thank you.

01:22.218 --> 01:24.652
Now my coffee.

01:24.931 --> 01:28.810
The half-and-half's curdled
and the garbage disposal's jammed.

01:29.147 --> 01:32.184
- Good morning to you too.
- Morning was two hours ago.

01:33.362 --> 01:37.241
And close that barn door.
We got a lady in the house now.

01:38.704 --> 01:42.697
This isn't my coffee.
Where's my finely ground Kenya blend?

01:43.044 --> 01:47.003
That's it. Daphne put an eggshell
and some allspice in it.

01:48.011 --> 01:51.208
And didn't that just dress it up.

01:51.516 --> 01:53.905
I like it. Gives it a zing.

01:54.188 --> 01:56.907
Now, sit down. Breakfast is ready.

01:57.193 --> 02:00.822
Dad, all I ever have is a bran muffin
and a touch of yoghurt.

02:01.158 --> 02:03.353
Girly food.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.737
I fixed your breakfast.
I made eggs in a nest.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.193
The Crane family specialty.

02:09.463 --> 02:14.378
Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in
a hollowed-out piece of white bread.

02:14.764 --> 02:19.121
I can almost hear my left ventricle
slamming shut as I speak.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.198
You want cheese on that?

02:21.441 --> 02:26.834
No. I'd like to leave some blood flow
for the clot to go swiftly to my brain.

02:31.124 --> 02:34.594
Can't have my coffee.
Can't have my breakfast.

02:35.965 --> 02:38.604
Oh, dear God, it wasn't a dream.

02:40.472 --> 02:43.828
I'll get him for this.
And his little dog too.

02:50.071 --> 02:52.585
Where's my paper?
Who stole my paper?

02:52.868 --> 02:55.018
Mrs Everly, you old bat, I know it's you!

02:55.289 --> 02:57.803
Yoo-hoo! It's right here.

02:58.085 --> 03:00.280
We brought it in for you.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.663
Sorry. Sorry.

03:05.054 --> 03:09.013
Where's the rubber band?
This paper has been read.

03:09.353 --> 03:12.311
Don't worry,
we won't tell you what's in it.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.701
That is not the point.

03:16.991 --> 03:19.744
Dad, come and sit down, please.

03:20.038 --> 03:22.757
You're going to give a speech,
aren't you?

03:23.043 --> 03:25.557
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You're psychic.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.469
Yes. But I think anyone
could feel this one coming on.

03:30.806 --> 03:34.799
Let us get something clear.
I'm not a morning person.

03:36.105 --> 03:38.858
I have to ease into my day slowly.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.746
First I have my coffee, sans eggshells

03:42.032 --> 03:45.104
or anything else
one picks out of the garbage.

03:47.166 --> 03:50.363
Then I have a low-fat,
high-fibre breakfast.

03:50.672 --> 03:54.551
Finally I sit down
and read a crisp, new newspaper.

03:54.887 --> 03:58.402
If I am robbed of the richness
of my morning routine,

03:58.726 --> 04:00.045
I cannot function.

04:00.271 --> 04:03.183
My radio show suffers
and, like ripples in a pond,

04:03.484 --> 04:08.035
so do the many listeners that rely
on my advice to help them in their lives.

04:08.409 --> 04:10.604
I'm sorry if it sounds priggish,

04:10.872 --> 04:13.784
but I've grown comfortable
with this part of myself.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.963
It is the magic that is me.

04:20.137 --> 04:22.412
Get used to it.

04:23.726 --> 04:27.036
I know this is a stressful time.
It's new for all of us,

04:27.357 --> 04:30.872
but I'm sure that soon
we'll all be getting along swimmingly.

04:31.197 --> 04:34.872
- Six more weeks of winter, I see.
- Oh, dear God!

04:55.570 --> 04:57.447
Down, Eddie, down.

04:59.368 --> 05:01.438
I said down.

05:03.166 --> 05:06.761
Good boy, Eddie. Just get down.
Good, good, Eddie.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.478
Get down!

05:09.760 --> 05:14.038
Dad, I can't read my paper.
Eddie's staring at me.

05:14.393 --> 05:18.306
Well, you do make quite a picture
in the morning.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.481
- Ignore him.
- I'm trying to.

05:20.736 --> 05:23.204
I'm talking to the dog.

05:48.073 --> 05:50.667
Don't even think about it!

05:53.625 --> 05:56.264
You're listening to Dr Frasier Crane.

05:56.546 --> 05:59.697
Our topic today is intrusion,

06:00.010 --> 06:04.765
those who encroach
on our sense of personal space.

06:05.143 --> 06:07.896
The neighbour who plays
his stereo too loud.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.545
The person who sits next to you
at the movies

06:10.819 --> 06:12.775
when there are 50 vacant seats.

06:13.031 --> 06:15.591
Now let's return to our calls.

06:15.869 --> 06:21.307
And let me remind you once more
that our topic today is intrusion...

06:21.712 --> 06:24.351
...since so many of you
seem to forget that!

06:24.634 --> 06:27.831
Dr Crane,
Leonard from Everett is on line two.

06:29.183 --> 06:31.299
Hello, Leonard. I'm listening.

06:31.561 --> 06:36.271
'Hi, Dr Crane.
I'm a little nervous, but here goes.

06:36.654 --> 06:40.533
'Several years ago
I became afraid of large, open spaces.

06:40.868 --> 06:45.623
'lf I went to the mall I'd break out
in a cold sweat and have to run home.'

06:46.003 --> 06:49.313
Yes, Leonard,
and your comments on intrusion?

06:49.633 --> 06:53.182
'Nothing. But now I'm afraid
to go outside at all.

06:53.515 --> 06:56.825
'l haven't seen another person
in eight months.'

06:57.146 --> 07:01.424
It sounds like you may have a serious
condition known as agoraphobia.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.848
But you're not alone.

07:04.115 --> 07:06.629
'But I am alone, Dr Crane.'

07:10.208 --> 07:14.679
Leonard, your problem is too difficult
to deal with in the time we have.

07:15.051 --> 07:18.726
Stay on the line.
We'll give you the name of a therapist.

07:19.057 --> 07:21.571
That's all the time we have today.

07:21.853 --> 07:26.131
You've been listening
to Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

07:26.486 --> 07:28.636
Stay tuned for the news.

07:28.907 --> 07:33.344
Then, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco
and the Gonzo Sports Show.

07:33.706 --> 07:35.424
I never miss it.

07:35.668 --> 07:38.136
Yeah, right.

07:39.841 --> 07:41.593
You want your messages?

07:41.844 --> 07:45.757
Roz, hang on to them.
I'll stay here in here for a while.

07:46.102 --> 07:48.980
I feel an overwhelming need
for solitude.

07:49.273 --> 07:53.983
I've got a fascinating book, comfortable
chair and a soundproof booth.

07:58.205 --> 08:01.880
- Hiya, Doc. How they hanging?
- Bulldog, why are you here?

08:02.211 --> 08:05.283
We lost power in Studio C.
I have to do my show here.

08:05.591 --> 08:07.627
(Blows whistle)

08:11.226 --> 08:13.182
Where the hell's my Cosell tape?

08:13.439 --> 08:16.909
Someone stole my tape!
This is total BS!

08:17.236 --> 08:19.830
Oh, here it is.

08:20.825 --> 08:22.941
Let me get out of your way.

08:23.204 --> 08:29.040
Doc, I heard what you said to that kid
who fantasises about killing his parents.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.581
You know what I'd have told him?

08:31.843 --> 08:35.039
Sports.
You go out there, break some heads.

08:35.350 --> 08:37.419
That'll turn him around.

08:37.686 --> 08:41.599
If only Jeffrey Dahmer
had picked up a squash racket.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.662
Where's my Lasorda tape? This is
total..!

08:44.948 --> 08:46.222
Got it.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.543
Hold on, I have to ask you something.

08:50.833 --> 08:54.269
Gary?
I broke up with him three weeks ago.

08:54.589 --> 08:57.865
The sex was OK,
but he was kind of limited.

08:58.179 --> 09:00.773
- Maybe...
- No. He wasn't bad in bed.

09:01.058 --> 09:04.892
He knew where all the parts were.
But most of them were his.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.058
Yes, totally passionless.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.995
It was like he was thinking
of someone else. I know I was.

09:14.247 --> 09:18.957
Somebody's here. I've got to go.
I'll talk to you later. Bye, Mom.

09:21.634 --> 09:23.989
- That was your mother?
- Yeah.

09:24.264 --> 09:28.382
- You talk to your mother like that?
- We talk about everything.

09:28.729 --> 09:32.438
- Isn't that healthy!
- You don't talk to your dad like that?

09:32.777 --> 09:36.452
- Hardly. We hardly speak at all.
- Really?

09:36.784 --> 09:39.742
We're not really very similar people.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.715
In fact, my brother and l
are a lot more like my mother.

09:44.046 --> 09:46.241
If it wasn't biologically impossible,

09:46.508 --> 09:49.864
I'd swear Dad was left
in a basket on our doorstep.

09:51.349 --> 09:55.467
- Sweetcakes, you seen my engineer?
- Someone's talking to you, Frasier.

09:55.815 --> 10:00.093
- Come on!
- He called. He'll be right here.

10:00.448 --> 10:04.680
Do you want to go across the street
and have an expensive coffee drink?

10:05.039 --> 10:09.078
Maybe some other time. I'd like
to continue my quest for solitude.

10:09.421 --> 10:11.616
Go someplace where my father,

10:11.883 --> 10:15.637
Mary Poppins
and the hound from hell can't find me.

10:15.973 --> 10:20.728
Maybe I'll sit under the shade of a tree
and read in a quiet park.

10:22.025 --> 10:25.142
(Thunder and rain)

10:27.075 --> 10:28.633
Hello.

10:32.793 --> 10:34.067
Hello?

10:35.089 --> 10:36.886
Dad?

10:37.134 --> 10:38.453
Daphne?

10:39.888 --> 10:41.958
Eddie?

10:44.438 --> 10:46.429
Could it be?

11:01.507 --> 11:05.386
(Hums Bizet's
"March Of The Toreadors")

11:12.901 --> 11:16.177
# Toreador, don't spit on the floor

11:16.657 --> 11:20.650
# Use the cuspidor-a
What do you think it's for-a? #

11:28.969 --> 11:31.483
(Door opens)

11:32.975 --> 11:36.126
So the elephant says, "He's with me."

11:38.777 --> 11:40.893
Ah, Dr Crane, you're home.

11:41.155 --> 11:43.623
We're back
from your father's physical therapy.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.265
Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.656
Not that I'm not delighted to see you,

11:48.918 --> 11:50.954
but I'm in the middle
of an exciting chapter.

11:51.214 --> 11:54.411
I understand.
So why don't I pop into the kitchen

11:54.719 --> 11:56.675
and brew you a nice pot of tea?

11:56.932 --> 12:01.369
- No, I've just poured a glass of wine.
- I see.

12:08.742 --> 12:12.212
- What are you reading?
- You wouldn't find it interesting.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.213
Any good?

12:14.460 --> 12:16.655
I haven't formed an opinion yet.

12:16.923 --> 12:20.677
Oddly enough,
I'm having trouble getting into it.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.822
Thick.

12:31.697 --> 12:34.495
Dad... Listen. I don't want to offend.

12:34.785 --> 12:39.017
But if you wouldn't mind,
could you just let me read my book?

12:39.376 --> 12:41.412
No problem.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.389
- What are you doing?
- Leaving you alone.

12:52.649 --> 12:56.039
- It's annoying!
- What's your problem?

12:56.363 --> 13:01.198
- You've been like this all week.
- I can't get any peace in my own home!

13:01.580 --> 13:02.899
Forgive me.

13:03.124 --> 13:05.115
When I moved in I didn't realise

13:05.378 --> 13:08.211
I had to stay chained
to the radiator in my room.

13:08.508 --> 13:10.783
- Perhaps only evenings.
- I heard that!

13:11.054 --> 13:13.204
You're never out of earshot!

13:13.474 --> 13:17.353
You've always been like this.
You were a fussy kid and it's got worse.

13:17.690 --> 13:20.158
You and your precious
morning routine.

13:20.444 --> 13:23.959
You've got to have your coffee,
got to have your quiet.

13:24.284 --> 13:26.559
Aren't you a little hothouse orchid?

13:26.830 --> 13:30.345
Hey! I don't have to sit here
and listen to that!

13:30.670 --> 13:33.468
Why don't you go
and live in a bubble?

13:33.758 --> 13:36.192
Right now it sounds very inviting.

13:41.730 --> 13:44.608
Finally a little peace and quiet
around here.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.143
Hello, Frasier.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.128
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

14:01.011 --> 14:04.970
That's a nice way to greet your brother.
Cafelatte, per piacere.

14:06.896 --> 14:09.091
I'm sorry, Niles, I'm trying to read.

14:09.359 --> 14:11.953
It seems no matter where I light,
I get interrupted.

14:12.239 --> 14:14.958
"The Holotropic Mind"
by Stanislav Grof.

14:15.244 --> 14:17.200
He concludes that changes in breathing

14:17.455 --> 14:20.208
induces alternate states
of consciousness.

14:20.502 --> 14:22.458
Now you've ruined the ending.

14:23.757 --> 14:27.716
I'm sorry. That was inconsiderate.
Mille grazie.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.232
How's Father?

14:34.483 --> 14:36.792
You mean the man
who's driving me crazy.

14:37.071 --> 14:40.427
The man who drove me
out of my own home!

14:40.743 --> 14:42.813
And how's work?

14:45.293 --> 14:50.287
Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do.
Dad and I had another fight.

14:50.677 --> 14:53.271
I'm afraid if we stay
under the same roof

14:53.556 --> 14:56.912
we'll do irreparable harm
to our relationship.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.902
What are the alternatives?

15:01.235 --> 15:05.706
If I didn't feel so guilty I'd do what
I should have done in the first place -

15:06.077 --> 15:08.147
get Dad and Daphne
their own apartment.

15:08.414 --> 15:11.645
It hasn't been that long.
Give it a chance.

15:11.961 --> 15:15.874
- Remember why you moved him in.
- Refresh me.

15:16.218 --> 15:18.413
You wanted to get closer to Dad.

15:18.681 --> 15:22.310
I still do, but he makes it impossible.

15:22.646 --> 15:26.275
I can't read my book
or have any peace in my own home.

15:26.611 --> 15:31.605
So you want to be closer to Dad,
but you don't actually want him around.

15:35.501 --> 15:41.337
Ask yourself, have you tried to sit down
talk to him? I mean really talk to him?

15:41.761 --> 15:43.752
Well, I...

15:45.684 --> 15:48.517
Maybe I haven't done my best.

15:50.608 --> 15:52.997
I guess
I owe that to the old man, don't l?

15:55.032 --> 15:59.981
Well... Thanks for the chat, Niles.
You're a good brother

16:00.375 --> 16:02.491
and a credit
to the psychiatric profession.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.313
You're a good brother too.

16:11.518 --> 16:14.908
Daphne, what are my things
doing here?

16:15.232 --> 16:17.268
My leather chair, my Tisami lamp.

16:17.528 --> 16:19.962
We're putting them in the basement.

16:20.241 --> 16:22.596
There was no room in your study
with my furniture in.

16:22.870 --> 16:26.783
- We discussed it last night.
- Of course.

16:27.127 --> 16:31.837
I was going to ask that peculiar man
from building services to help me.

16:32.219 --> 16:35.097
Oh, yes. Kyle. Give him my regards.

16:35.391 --> 16:40.226
Remind me again. Which one
of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?

16:41.985 --> 16:43.782
The brown one.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.863
Daphne left dinner in the fridge,
if you're hungry.

16:57.177 --> 16:59.486
Thanks, but I'm not.

16:59.764 --> 17:01.038
Dad...

17:02.352 --> 17:04.991
I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier.

17:05.272 --> 17:07.787
Forget about it. I already have.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.061
There's been a lot of tension
between us.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.483
We never have a chance to sit and talk.

17:14.789 --> 17:18.417
I thought we might have a conversation.

17:18.753 --> 17:20.233
Right now?

17:20.464 --> 17:22.819
I think now would be a good time.

17:23.095 --> 17:24.847
Later would be better.

17:25.098 --> 17:29.694
It shouldn't be a long conversation.
I'm talking three minutes of your life.

17:30.064 --> 17:32.783
OK, but my programme's coming on.

17:33.069 --> 17:38.063
If it will make you any happier I'll get the
egg timer and I'll set it for three minutes.

17:40.165 --> 17:42.360
So what do you want to talk about?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.857
The idea is to have a normal,
honest conversation

17:46.175 --> 17:48.973
without getting
on each other's nerves.

17:52.518 --> 17:54.110
Ready?

17:57.526 --> 18:00.040
- Go.
- This is stupid.

18:00.323 --> 18:03.076
One second? That's our personal best?

18:07.542 --> 18:10.420
Let us see if we can beat it.

18:12.468 --> 18:13.867
Ready?

18:14.096 --> 18:15.575
Go.

18:18.018 --> 18:20.816
- How about those Seahawks?
- No sports.

18:21.107 --> 18:24.577
- No opera.
- Agreed.

18:27.033 --> 18:28.705
Ready?

18:28.953 --> 18:30.432
Go.

18:33.085 --> 18:35.645
This is your idea.
You say something first.

18:37.300 --> 18:41.373
All right. I'll tell you something
about myself that you don't know.

18:42.976 --> 18:48.175
Six months ago, when Lilith and l
were really on the rocks...

18:48.569 --> 18:54.246
...there was a time of depression
I went through that was so terrible...

18:54.662 --> 19:00.578
...that I actually climbed out on a ledge
and wondered if life was worth living.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.601
Then...I thought of Frederick.

19:04.929 --> 19:07.727
And you didn't jump, huh?

19:12.984 --> 19:14.258
Good, Dad.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.259
Wow, I never knew that.

19:17.533 --> 19:22.004
That's the point of this experiment,
to tell each other something

19:22.374 --> 19:25.047
we don't know about each other,
something vulnerable.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.408
Your turn.

19:27.674 --> 19:29.551
OK.

19:29.804 --> 19:32.034
About two months ago

19:32.308 --> 19:35.459
I was going through
old pictures of your mother and me.

19:35.772 --> 19:39.287
All of a sudden,
something flew up in my eye.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.806
When I was trying to get it out,

19:42.074 --> 19:46.864
I realised that I could turn my eyelid
inside out, the way kids do at camp.

19:48.334 --> 19:51.770
- That's it? You call that vulnerable?
- It hurt!

19:53.384 --> 19:55.375
I'm not talking about that kind of pain.

19:55.638 --> 19:58.516
I'm talking about your emotions,
your soul.

19:58.810 --> 20:01.643
A painful, gut-wrenching experience.

20:01.940 --> 20:04.898
- Other than this one?
- Always a flip answer.

20:05.195 --> 20:07.914
- This whole thing's stupid.
- Not to me.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.668
How should I expect
anything out of you?

20:10.955 --> 20:13.515
You are the most cold,
unapproachable,

20:13.792 --> 20:16.181
stubborn, cold man I've ever known.

20:16.464 --> 20:19.024
- You said "cold" twice, Mr Egghead.
- Egghead! Egghead!

20:19.302 --> 20:22.499
- You said "egghead" twice too!
- You are infuriating!

20:22.807 --> 20:24.684
Know what you are?

20:24.936 --> 20:26.449
(Timer dings)

20:26.689 --> 20:27.883
I'll tell you later.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.453
I don't think you see how serious this is.

20:36.747 --> 20:39.420
Will you give it a rest?

20:39.710 --> 20:43.066
We're not getting along
and it's not getting any better.

20:43.383 --> 20:47.661
I'm not sure how to say this,
but...uh... I...

20:49.519 --> 20:51.953
I'm afraid I'm going to have to...

20:52.231 --> 20:57.544
I know. You want what's best for both
of us. You want to get me out of here.

20:57.949 --> 21:02.420
We'll each have our own space
and can put an end to all this bickering.

21:03.792 --> 21:07.228
Well, yes. I guess
it wasn't so hard to say after all.

21:07.548 --> 21:10.779
- Except for one thing. I'm not going.
- What?

21:11.096 --> 21:15.726
You want us to forge
some great father-son relationship,

21:16.104 --> 21:20.575
That takes a couple of years,
doesn't it? You're the shrink.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.606
- A couple of years?
- It'll go by before you know it.

21:27.330 --> 21:30.049
Either that, or it'll seem like eternity.

21:36.053 --> 21:39.090
I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.

21:41.688 --> 21:45.363
- OK.
- How about us having a beer together?

21:45.694 --> 21:50.484
Wow! In all these years
you've never asked me that.

21:50.870 --> 21:53.020
I'd love to have a beer with you.

21:53.290 --> 21:56.646
- Haul ass. The store is about to close.
- Right.

22:03.557 --> 22:08.267
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:09.526 --> 22:10.481
# Mercy!

22:10.693 --> 22:13.685
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...

22:13.991 --> 22:17.586
# But I got you pegged!

22:17.914 --> 22:22.704
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:23.715 --> 22:27.151
# They're calling again
Good night! #

22:28.305 --> 22:34.636
