WEBVTT

00:53.595 --> 00:55.832
They're really something.

00:57.732 --> 00:59.634
Absolutely mesmerizing.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.006
Such beautiful.

01:05.875 --> 01:06.708
And.

01:09.011 --> 01:10.612
Skillful creatures.

01:12.181 --> 01:17.385
That is what we call an apex
predator.

01:23.125 --> 01:23.960
You see.

01:26.162 --> 01:27.330
They have been

01:29.332 --> 01:35.037
genetically wired to understand
the command hierarchy.

01:36.172 --> 01:41.177
They know their rank and their
responsibilities in the pack.

01:42.044 --> 01:43.445
They never stray.

01:44.347 --> 01:46.349
Because they understand.

01:47.382 --> 01:50.017
That if they do, it would result

01:50.019 --> 01:53.386
in the harshest of
repercussions.

01:53.388 --> 01:55.224
So there's no anarchy.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.393
There's no rebellion.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.730
There's only order.

02:04.766 --> 02:06.501
Now we, as a species,

02:09.305 --> 02:12.741
do not necessarily operate
instinctively,

02:13.608 --> 02:16.178
nor do we prey on weaker beings

02:17.246 --> 02:20.281
just for the sake of the hunt
or for food,

02:20.283 --> 02:25.420
I mean we are calculating,
sophisticated.

02:27.023 --> 02:30.590
We're at the top of the food
chain.

02:30.592 --> 02:34.663
But if we, like them, break the
chain of command,

02:36.332 --> 02:39.835
then there are severe
consequences to pay.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.041
The pecking order must not be
disrupted.

02:46.108 --> 02:46.943
Or.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.179
We would have chaos.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.048
Mr. Wiley!

02:53.349 --> 02:56.919
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you
had guests.

02:58.453 --> 03:02.423
Did I or did I not make it
abundantly

03:02.425 --> 03:04.858
clear to you that you will never

03:04.860 --> 03:07.194
enter this room when
that door is closed?

03:07.196 --> 03:08.062
I just...

03:08.064 --> 03:11.799
Not if this house were on fire
and all

03:11.801 --> 03:14.902
of my possessions were burning
to a crisp.

03:14.904 --> 03:18.973
Not if my mother, who I love
more than anyone

03:18.975 --> 03:23.177
or anything on this Earth, were
found brutally murdered.

03:23.179 --> 03:27.580
Not, and this is a stretch, if
God Himself came down

03:27.582 --> 03:32.685
from the heavens just to hang
out with me personally,

03:32.687 --> 03:35.389
should you, or would you, enter
this room!

03:35.391 --> 03:37.157
Did I not ask for that?

03:37.159 --> 03:38.225
I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley.

03:38.227 --> 03:39.625
Well don't be sorry!

03:39.627 --> 03:40.463
Be gone!

03:50.139 --> 03:55.144
I sincerely apologize for this
most boorish interruption.

03:55.344 --> 03:56.345
Where was I?

03:59.348 --> 04:00.182
Chaos.

04:03.052 --> 04:04.719
We don't want chaos.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.623
Chaos topples empires and
kingdoms.

04:11.327 --> 04:14.497
And chaos shall not be
tolerated, now.

04:19.235 --> 04:22.872
This disloyal ingrate and his
most obnoxious

04:26.608 --> 04:29.542
offspring are under the
impression

04:29.544 --> 04:32.379
that I am not aware that they

04:32.381 --> 04:35.117
were behind this act of
betrayal.

04:36.718 --> 04:38.988
So a precedent must be set.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.094
Order must be restored.

04:48.531 --> 04:53.367
What I want from you is to
end...

04:53.369 --> 04:54.103
this...

04:56.105 --> 04:56.939
chaos...

05:22.998 --> 05:24.198
Huh.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.365
Look who it is.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.699
Mr. 8-Card Charlie.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.700
Don't start with me, Mick.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.936
I'm not in the mood.

05:28.938 --> 05:30.137
No, congratulations.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.239
Congratulations, that might be
one of the single

05:32.241 --> 05:35.476
worst plays in the history of
blackjack.

05:35.478 --> 05:38.312
He hit 21 on eight cards.

05:38.314 --> 05:39.780
You know the odds of that
happening?

05:39.782 --> 05:42.149
You split queens and
went all in!

05:42.151 --> 05:44.717
A baboon knows to stay on 20,
Jackie.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.122
Mick, I'm on no sleep and I'm
in the red right now, okay?

05:48.124 --> 05:49.590
Oh, you're in the red.

05:49.592 --> 05:50.424
Is that right?

05:50.426 --> 05:51.258
Is that right?

05:51.260 --> 05:52.092
You're in the red?

05:52.094 --> 05:53.026
All right, you know what?

05:53.028 --> 05:54.261
You need to ease up, Mick.

05:54.263 --> 05:56.296
I'm so sick of this shit.

05:58.234 --> 06:02.436
Jesus fucking, what is your
fucking problem man?

06:02.438 --> 06:04.770
Why would you do that?

06:04.772 --> 06:06.340
You know mom gave this to me
for good luck.

06:06.342 --> 06:07.241
Well guess what?

06:07.243 --> 06:09.009
It didn't work.

06:09.011 --> 06:10.878
Look at this position we're in.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.013
Look at this position we are in.

06:13.015 --> 06:16.450
This clusterfuck of a situation
is because of you, Jackie.

06:16.452 --> 06:17.384
You're a curse.

06:17.386 --> 06:18.619
You're a bad
fucking omen, and all

06:18.621 --> 06:20.053
the four-leaf clovers in the
world

06:20.055 --> 06:21.221
are not gonna save our ass.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.055
Is that right?

06:22.057 --> 06:22.890
Yeah.

06:22.892 --> 06:23.991
You must have got hit on the
head

06:23.993 --> 06:25.125
one too many times 'cause if I
remember correctly,

06:25.127 --> 06:27.261
it was your idea to go to Tony
in the first place.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.129
You are fucking delusional!

06:29.131 --> 06:31.465
You are full of shit up
to your fucking ears!

06:31.467 --> 06:32.466
You need to relax.

06:32.468 --> 06:35.135
No, you blew his money,
we were in the clear,

06:35.137 --> 06:37.171
and you fucking blew it, buddy!

06:37.173 --> 06:38.841
You fucking blew it!

06:39.842 --> 06:41.175
You need to relax.

06:41.177 --> 06:42.476
Don't tell me to fucking relax.

06:42.478 --> 06:44.077
Can you comprehend in this pea
brain what that means?

06:44.079 --> 06:44.912
Cut it out, Mick!

06:44.914 --> 06:45.745
Can you?

06:45.747 --> 06:46.712
Huh?

06:46.714 --> 06:47.414
Do you understand who
the fuck we're gonna

06:47.416 --> 06:50.384
be paying rent to at best now?

06:50.386 --> 06:52.553
Almost a hundred years this bar
has been in our family.

06:52.555 --> 06:54.621
A hundred fucking years, Jackie!

06:54.623 --> 06:56.890
Yeah, and we'll figure
something out.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.792
No, there's nothing
to figure out.

06:58.794 --> 06:59.626
It's done.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.094
It's over.

07:01.096 --> 07:01.931
Over.

07:03.566 --> 07:04.865
I caught a bad beat, all right?

07:04.867 --> 07:05.832
You caught a bad beat.

07:05.834 --> 07:06.900
You know what?

07:06.902 --> 07:08.669
I catch a bad beat my entire
life because of you.

07:08.671 --> 07:09.937
I am so sick of
cleaning up after

07:09.939 --> 07:11.371
your fucking mess all the time.

07:11.373 --> 07:12.206
I'm done!

07:12.208 --> 07:13.006
I'm fucking through!

07:13.008 --> 07:13.840
Oh yeah?

07:13.842 --> 07:14.675
Yeah.

07:14.677 --> 07:15.609
You know what I think?

07:15.611 --> 07:16.343
I think I need to put
you down for nap,

07:16.345 --> 07:17.211
you miserable little prick.

07:17.213 --> 07:18.345
Oh is that right, you
threatening me?

07:18.347 --> 07:20.816
I'm fucking threatening you!

07:22.918 --> 07:24.218
That's it,
you're going to sleep!

07:24.220 --> 07:25.052
Get off me!

07:25.054 --> 07:27.487
Come here, come here!

07:27.489 --> 07:29.489
You're going to sleep.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.757
You're going to sleep, you're
going to sleep.

07:31.759 --> 07:33.360
I swear I'm gonna
put you to sleep!

07:33.362 --> 07:34.194
Jackie!

07:34.196 --> 07:35.229
I wish you would put me to
sleep.

07:35.231 --> 07:36.463
I'll put you to sleep right now!

07:36.465 --> 07:37.531
I wish you would so
I wouldn't have to be

07:37.533 --> 07:38.632
stuck with you anymore
in my life!

07:38.634 --> 07:39.700
You should kill me!

07:39.702 --> 07:41.270
I'm so sick of you!

07:43.572 --> 07:44.404
Hey!

07:44.406 --> 07:45.241
Fuckos!

07:47.910 --> 07:49.710
When you're done
humping each other,

07:49.712 --> 07:51.814
we'll go see the old man.

07:54.984 --> 07:55.983
Let's go!

07:55.985 --> 07:57.818
Up and at 'em!

07:57.820 --> 08:01.188
Larry, watch the bar.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.494
What are you doing?

08:07.496 --> 08:08.495
Did I tell you you could smoke
in my car?

08:08.497 --> 08:09.363
Put that thing out.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.731
Put that fucking thing out!

08:10.733 --> 08:11.734
All right!

08:14.203 --> 08:15.669
What are you, a fucking animal?

08:15.671 --> 08:17.104
What's your problem?

08:17.106 --> 08:18.405
You want me to throw it in the
glove box?

08:18.407 --> 08:19.506
Where was I supposed
to throw it?

08:19.508 --> 08:21.975
Stick it up your
fucking stupid asshole.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.511
My daughter's gotta grow up in
this fucking world, Frankie.

08:24.513 --> 08:25.679
What the fuck?

08:25.681 --> 08:27.681
Have a little respect for the
environment.

08:27.683 --> 08:29.449
Oh we're saving the
whales now, okay.

08:29.451 --> 08:30.384
You know what your problem is?

08:30.386 --> 08:31.885
You got no fucking class.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.888
Am I right or am I
right back there?

08:34.890 --> 08:37.758
Yeah, Jack and Jill, I'm
talking to you.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.227
You two are awfully fucking
quiet back there.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.396
No snappy remarks, no jokes?

08:42.398 --> 08:44.464
Where are those big fucking
mouths now?

08:44.466 --> 08:45.401
Here it is.

08:47.369 --> 08:50.437
Hey Mick, I got a
question for you.

08:50.439 --> 08:55.409
What if I told you I had a way
for you to make 50 dimes,

08:55.411 --> 08:58.312
get you out of this mess right
now, would you take it?

08:58.314 --> 09:00.180
Well it depends.

09:00.182 --> 09:01.114
This fucking guy.

09:01.116 --> 09:02.082
He's fucking with you.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.383
He's got options,
you know what I mean?

09:03.385 --> 09:04.685
What would I have to do?

09:04.687 --> 09:06.620
Oh it's nothing too crazy.

09:06.622 --> 09:08.255
Nothing too crazy at all.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.290
You just have to screw a pig.

09:10.292 --> 09:11.992
I'd pay to see that.

09:11.994 --> 09:13.660
Man you're a sick fuck, you
know that Frankie?

09:13.662 --> 09:14.628
Yeah, so what?

09:14.630 --> 09:16.330
You're really a sick fucking
demented fuck.

09:16.332 --> 09:17.497
What's her name?

09:17.499 --> 09:18.565
Come again?

09:18.567 --> 09:19.399
The pig.

09:19.401 --> 09:20.736
What's her name?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.437
Marshette.

09:23.439 --> 09:24.471
It's Marshette.

09:24.473 --> 09:27.240
No, you fucking jackoff,
the animal.

09:27.242 --> 09:29.176
Like the one you find on a farm?

09:29.178 --> 09:32.279
Fucking E-I-E-I-O.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.081
Is the 50 grand tax free?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.251
Let's assume that it is.

09:37.252 --> 09:38.585
Here's what I would do.

09:38.587 --> 09:41.488
I'd put a gun to
Jackie here's head.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.423
I'd make him hump the pig.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.992
I'd collect the 50 large.

09:45.994 --> 09:48.595
And then I'd put
two in his noggin.

09:48.597 --> 09:49.831
You'd whack me?

09:49.833 --> 09:51.765
Yeah, put you out
of your misery.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.066
Why am I in misery?

09:53.068 --> 09:55.302
Because you just humped a pig.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.770
How could you live with
yourself?

10:00.309 --> 10:01.811
I like this guy.

10:02.878 --> 10:06.913
Well you know, don't get too
attached.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.615
Fritz.

10:47.891 --> 10:50.659
Hey Dennis the Menace,
watch out.

10:55.832 --> 10:57.764
Hey Bubbie, Fritzy!

10:57.766 --> 10:59.099
What the fuck?

11:00.135 --> 11:02.204
I speak fucking Japanese?

11:08.076 --> 11:09.311
Open that shit.

11:14.851 --> 11:15.749
Gus!

11:15.751 --> 11:17.250
Gus!

11:17.252 --> 11:19.085
Fucking how many
times we gotta have

11:19.087 --> 11:21.354
this conversation about
cigarette smoke?

11:21.356 --> 11:22.222
Put that shit out.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.757
Don't blow that shit in my face.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.893
What I tell you about all the
smoking?

11:25.895 --> 11:27.561
You need to fucking regulate
this shit.

11:27.563 --> 11:28.930
Are you serious?

11:28.932 --> 11:29.963
Am I serious?

11:29.965 --> 11:31.431
How many fucking, I told you my
father

11:31.433 --> 11:33.835
didn't like to smoke, I don't
like it.

11:33.837 --> 11:35.168
It's fucking too much.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.002
Use your head.

11:36.004 --> 11:37.270
Listen baby, I wanna talk to you

11:37.272 --> 11:38.572
about a thing I want you to do.

11:39.741 --> 11:40.875
Fuck, I gotta go to the can.

11:40.877 --> 11:41.975
Hold on, I'm gonna raise you.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.276
No, I gotta go to the can.

11:43.278 --> 11:44.511
How come every time I got a hand

11:44.513 --> 11:45.847
you gotta go drop a deuce?

11:45.849 --> 11:46.948
Fucking dairy intolerance.

11:46.950 --> 11:47.915
I gotta go to the can.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.115
Stop inhaling moots!

11:49.117 --> 11:50.317
How about that?

11:50.319 --> 11:51.184
Gotta shit, Paulie?

11:51.186 --> 11:52.856
Fuck you.

11:53.857 --> 11:55.857
You want five dimes on the
over, yeah.

11:55.859 --> 11:58.091
I know you're good for it,
where you gonna go?

11:58.093 --> 12:01.027
You gotta stay here and protect
and serve right?

12:01.029 --> 12:01.965
I gotta go.

12:02.966 --> 12:03.997
Well look who's here.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.132
My two favorite Mick brothers.

12:06.134 --> 12:08.235
It's a shame about your bar.

12:08.237 --> 12:09.571
Breaks my heart.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.041
Where's my money?

12:14.510 --> 12:15.342
Tony...

12:15.344 --> 12:19.012
Hey, it's Mr. Fucking Divalo
to you.

12:19.014 --> 12:22.582
Have some fucking respect,
you fucking bitch.

12:22.584 --> 12:25.452
What, you got something
on your mind?

12:25.454 --> 12:26.921
You got something you wanna say?

12:26.923 --> 12:28.455
No, go ahead, fucking say it,
say it.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.489
Go ahead, say it.

12:29.491 --> 12:30.323
Okay.

12:30.325 --> 12:31.157
No?

12:31.159 --> 12:32.158
Okay.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.028
Turn your little fucking bitch
ass around.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.329
Okay, Mr. Divalo...

12:36.331 --> 12:37.165
Divalo.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.533
Mr. Divalo...

12:39.535 --> 12:40.702
It's Divalo.

12:41.670 --> 12:42.771
Mr. Divalo.

12:43.940 --> 12:46.273
With all due respect, we just
wanna express

12:46.275 --> 12:48.876
our sincerest gratitude for
giving us the loan again.

12:48.878 --> 12:50.644
We're very thankful.

12:50.646 --> 12:53.580
'Cause no bank would
even touch us.

12:53.582 --> 12:54.614
Bank?

12:54.616 --> 12:56.550
Wait a minute, let me
get this straight.

12:56.552 --> 13:00.053
You used my money
as your last resort?

13:00.055 --> 13:00.922
No.

13:00.924 --> 13:03.156
No no, that's not what I meant
at all.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.293
I just figured there'd be less
risk involved.

13:06.295 --> 13:07.129
What?

13:08.130 --> 13:09.830
That there would be less risk

13:09.832 --> 13:12.299
involved with the interest rate.

13:12.301 --> 13:13.567
Not you.

13:14.904 --> 13:15.735
The interest rate.

13:15.737 --> 13:16.804
You know, it's a good thing

13:16.806 --> 13:18.138
I'm in a good mood 'cause my
wife

13:18.140 --> 13:21.243
just brought me my favorite
sandwich.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.648
You should learn how to keep
your mouth shut.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.252
You'll live longer.

13:31.153 --> 13:32.485
You should listen to what my
father says.

13:32.487 --> 13:34.021
Let the small one talk.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.622
You know, I gotta be honest.

13:35.624 --> 13:37.657
I never stepped a
foot in your bar.

13:37.659 --> 13:40.727
I could never get used to the
smell of potatoes and piss.

13:40.729 --> 13:42.162
But your father.

13:42.164 --> 13:44.431
I liked him, he was
a stand-up guy.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.267
It baffles me how you came from
the same sack.

13:47.269 --> 13:48.635
But you.

13:48.637 --> 13:51.371
You always had respect, you
kept your head down.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.875
You're a good boy.

13:54.077 --> 13:55.408
Thank you.

13:55.410 --> 13:57.677
But my time's very important.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.080
So let's get to it.

13:59.082 --> 14:01.949
Okay, well that's what we
wanted to discuss with you.

14:01.951 --> 14:03.050
Discuss?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.485
Is this a discussion?

14:05.487 --> 14:06.854
I didn't mean like that,
I just...

14:06.856 --> 14:09.356
I've always been patient with
you two right?

14:09.358 --> 14:10.624
Yes you have, absolutely.

14:10.626 --> 14:12.026
When you wanted an extension

14:12.028 --> 14:13.293
I gave it to you, correct?

14:13.295 --> 14:14.361
Yes you did.

14:14.363 --> 14:15.495
Absolutely, yes you did.

14:15.497 --> 14:17.330
I never raised a vig, did I?

14:17.332 --> 14:18.331
No you did not.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.503
Then how come I
don't have my money?

14:22.972 --> 14:24.573
Okay, Mr. Divalo.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.642
Just give us a few weeks and we
will get your money.

14:28.644 --> 14:29.476
I promise.

14:29.478 --> 14:31.578
Now how's that gonna happen?

14:31.580 --> 14:33.246
When you two broken down valises

14:33.248 --> 14:35.348
can't rub two quarters together?

14:35.350 --> 14:36.951
I want my money!

14:36.953 --> 14:37.885
We will find a way.

14:37.887 --> 14:38.819
We can go to the bank.

14:38.821 --> 14:40.821
No Jackie, shut the fuck up.

14:40.823 --> 14:42.689
Not good enough.

14:44.093 --> 14:46.194
Not good enough.

14:55.004 --> 14:58.605
The way I see it right now, you
got three options.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.841
Option number one.

15:00.843 --> 15:04.511
You can miraculously pull the
money that you owe me,

15:04.513 --> 15:06.947
plus the vig, out of your ass
in the next

15:06.949 --> 15:09.616
10 seconds, but that's not
gonna happen.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.351
Option number two.

15:11.353 --> 15:13.286
I can give you a
less painful way

15:13.288 --> 15:15.156
to pay me back the
money you owe me.

15:15.158 --> 15:19.359
You go with my boy Joey here on
a simple house call.

15:19.361 --> 15:20.193
Okay?

15:20.195 --> 15:23.363
I'd love to hear the third
option.

15:23.365 --> 15:24.364
Whatever it is, we'll do it.

15:24.366 --> 15:25.198
Okay, Mr. Divalo?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.033
We'll do it.

15:26.035 --> 15:26.867
Good.

15:26.869 --> 15:28.435
You go with Joey.

15:28.437 --> 15:30.670
He's gonna pay a visit to some
guy.

15:30.672 --> 15:33.874
A deadbeat guy who's been late
on his payments.

15:33.876 --> 15:36.376
Does that sound familiar to you?

15:36.378 --> 15:39.113
I think he put me on the pay me
no mind list.

15:39.115 --> 15:41.214
Too many people start hearing
that,

15:41.216 --> 15:43.316
they're gonna start thinking
that I'm soft

15:43.318 --> 15:44.919
and they can take advantage of
me.

15:44.921 --> 15:47.754
They'll treat me like a jerkoff.

15:47.756 --> 15:49.689
So here's what we're gonna do.

15:49.691 --> 15:51.658
We're gonna pay this guy a
little visit

15:51.660 --> 15:54.494
and we're gonna settle it once
and for all.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.530
You follow Joey's lead and you
watch his back.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.399
And most important.

15:59.401 --> 16:00.600
You!

16:00.602 --> 16:02.903
You keep your mouth shut.

16:02.905 --> 16:03.806
Understood?

16:04.841 --> 16:05.942
Understood.

16:07.743 --> 16:08.575
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

16:08.577 --> 16:09.709
Jesus fucking Christ!

16:09.711 --> 16:12.213
Hey, calm down, sweetie pie.

16:12.215 --> 16:13.713
Don't get your panties all in a
bunch.

16:13.715 --> 16:15.482
Yeah, what do we need these for?

16:15.484 --> 16:17.450
To play tennis with, you
fucking jerkoff.

16:17.452 --> 16:18.786
What the fuck you
think they're for?

16:18.788 --> 16:20.988
Okay, okay, okay wait.

16:20.990 --> 16:23.456
With all due respect, you know
us our whole lives.

16:23.458 --> 16:24.691
We don't want trouble.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.227
We don't want trouble like
this, this isn't...

16:26.229 --> 16:27.194
It's not trouble.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.063
It's no trouble, this is just
for show.

16:29.065 --> 16:30.663
It's for a little intimidation.

16:30.665 --> 16:31.531
Just for show.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.234
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

16:33.236 --> 16:34.070
Come on.

16:35.071 --> 16:37.370
I give you my word.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.605
And my word's garbage.

16:45.614 --> 16:46.646
Hey!

16:46.648 --> 16:47.580
Strike!

16:55.158 --> 16:56.259
Daddy's home.

17:00.495 --> 17:01.427
Want some?

17:01.429 --> 17:02.695
No, I'm okay.

17:02.697 --> 17:03.530
You?

17:03.532 --> 17:04.364
No.

17:04.366 --> 17:05.199
No, fuck you then.

17:05.201 --> 17:06.066
More for me.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.069
More for me.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.742
All right, okay.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.313
Ladies.

17:20.315 --> 17:23.150
Leave your fucking phones in
the car.

17:23.152 --> 17:23.986
Get out.

17:36.665 --> 17:38.598
What is that for?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.036
I lost my keys.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.456
Shall we?

18:04.392 --> 18:06.628
Time to make the doughnuts.

18:09.664 --> 18:10.498
Barry!

18:12.601 --> 18:13.435
Hey Barry!

18:14.603 --> 18:16.170
Come on out!

18:16.172 --> 18:17.439
You got guests!

18:20.042 --> 18:21.310
Come on, Barry!

18:22.211 --> 18:23.676
Barry, I know you're here.

18:23.678 --> 18:27.047
Your stupid fucking Volvo's in
the driveway.

18:27.049 --> 18:30.918
I'll get my fucking Sawzall
and, oh hey!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.286
Here he is.

18:32.288 --> 18:35.022
Come here, get your fucking
broke ass down here.

18:35.024 --> 18:36.190
What the hell is going on, man?

18:36.192 --> 18:38.158
What are you doing in my house?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.159
Don't play me stupid.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.829
You're gonna play me stupid
like that?

18:41.831 --> 18:43.763
You know why I'm here.

18:43.765 --> 18:45.799
You know why the fuck I'm here.

18:45.801 --> 18:48.168
Joey, come on man, I got
neighbors.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.569
I don't give a fuck.

18:49.571 --> 18:50.703
I don't give a fuck about your

18:50.705 --> 18:52.572
fucking neighbors, you
motherfucker!

18:52.574 --> 18:54.607
You owe me fucking money, you
cunt!

18:54.609 --> 18:56.277
Motherfucker, I don't give a
fuck!

18:57.313 --> 18:58.511
Come here, you motherfucker!

18:58.513 --> 19:00.680
Get on the fucking ground!

19:00.682 --> 19:01.514
Joey please!

19:01.516 --> 19:02.883
I just need a little more time!

19:02.885 --> 19:04.251
You fucking degenerates, you all

19:04.253 --> 19:05.853
sing the same fucking tune.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.288
You make me fucking sick!

19:07.290 --> 19:09.522
Motherfucker look at me, look
at me!

19:09.524 --> 19:11.191
I deal in violence.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.558
That's what I do.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.527
And you ain't got no more time.

19:14.529 --> 19:15.364
See this?

19:16.464 --> 19:19.033
Fucking little cunt
motherfucker.

19:19.035 --> 19:20.500
Grab this fucking piece of shit,

19:20.502 --> 19:22.002
bring him to the basement.

19:22.004 --> 19:23.005
Which one?

19:24.373 --> 19:26.539
Which one what?

19:26.541 --> 19:27.374
Which basement?

19:27.376 --> 19:29.009
Here or the social club?

19:29.011 --> 19:29.845
Yeah.

19:31.881 --> 19:32.714
Here.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.615
You fucking morons!

19:35.617 --> 19:37.251
Here!

19:37.253 --> 19:38.321
Fucking here!

19:40.156 --> 19:42.555
Yeah, don't be careful with him.

19:47.063 --> 19:48.230
You want some?

19:53.169 --> 19:54.567
Oh.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.468
Oh.

19:55.470 --> 19:56.638
Still with me?

19:57.539 --> 19:58.372
Huh?

19:58.374 --> 19:59.206
Let me see.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.074
Yeah there it is, there it is.

20:00.076 --> 20:00.908
Attaboy.

20:00.910 --> 20:01.875
Joey come on, please.

20:01.877 --> 20:03.978
Don't you Joey come on please
me,

20:03.980 --> 20:07.881
you little fucking bow-legged
mook motherfucker!

20:07.883 --> 20:09.551
You see, Barry here.

20:11.187 --> 20:13.755
Barry owes my old man 80 dimes.

20:15.157 --> 20:18.760
But over the course of the past
few months,

20:19.728 --> 20:22.695
Barry developed a case of
amnesia.

20:22.697 --> 20:23.529
I don't got it.

20:23.531 --> 20:24.465
I swear to Christ.

20:24.467 --> 20:25.466
Hey!

20:25.468 --> 20:26.800
Don't you dare take the Lord's
name in vain,

20:26.802 --> 20:29.870
you fucking bow-legged fucking
rat piece of shit!

20:29.872 --> 20:32.906
Argh, Barry, you got a hard
fucking head.

20:32.908 --> 20:34.108
Please, please, I can get it!

20:34.110 --> 20:35.109
I just need a day!

20:35.111 --> 20:35.943
You ain't got a day.

20:35.945 --> 20:36.777
Please!

20:36.779 --> 20:37.610
You ain't got a day!

20:37.612 --> 20:38.445
Please, I'm begging you!

20:38.447 --> 20:39.279
You ain't got a day!

20:39.281 --> 20:40.948
You can beg all you want!

20:40.950 --> 20:43.117
You owe money all over town!

20:43.119 --> 20:45.585
And the likelihood of us getting

20:45.587 --> 20:48.889
our money back from you is
about as likely

20:48.891 --> 20:51.492
as you leaving this basement
alive.

20:51.494 --> 20:53.427
Joey, please.

20:53.429 --> 20:55.762
You don't have to do this.

20:55.764 --> 20:57.064
Shoot this piece of shit.

20:57.066 --> 20:57.898
Please!

20:57.900 --> 20:58.731
Please don't do this!

20:58.733 --> 21:00.666
Just shut your fucking mouth!

21:00.668 --> 21:02.236
Joey.

21:02.238 --> 21:03.070
Joey.

21:03.072 --> 21:05.806
I'm gonna bite your fucking ear
off.

21:05.808 --> 21:07.740
Listen to me, man.

21:07.742 --> 21:09.709
We kill him, the old man's never

21:09.711 --> 21:11.947
gonna get his money, right?

21:13.783 --> 21:16.283
Are you fucking deaf?

21:16.285 --> 21:18.385
There is no money.

21:18.387 --> 21:20.620
He's fucking in debt all over
town.

21:20.622 --> 21:21.754
Come on, right here.

21:21.756 --> 21:22.990
Right here, right between his

21:22.992 --> 21:24.724
stupid fucking eyes, shoot him.

21:24.726 --> 21:25.691
Come on, shoot him.

21:25.693 --> 21:26.527
Joey.

21:26.529 --> 21:27.361
Shoot him!

21:27.363 --> 21:28.195
Joey, come on.

21:28.197 --> 21:29.263
This wasn't part of the deal.

21:29.265 --> 21:30.099
Yeah.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.565
Part of the deal?

21:32.567 --> 21:35.805
What fucking planet do
you two live on?

21:36.671 --> 21:39.807
This is the only deal if you
wanna wipe your debt clean.

21:39.809 --> 21:42.378
Now take your fucking guns out.

21:45.014 --> 21:46.182
Take them out!

21:48.384 --> 21:50.484
Please, for the love of God,
please!

21:50.486 --> 21:51.318
What did I tell you?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.486
Shut your fucking mouth!

21:52.488 --> 21:53.686
Shoot this piece of shit.

21:53.688 --> 21:54.822
Yes, that's it.

21:54.824 --> 21:55.755
That's it.

21:55.757 --> 21:57.590
Pop wanted you both
to give him a slug.

21:57.592 --> 21:59.659
Come on, do it.

21:59.661 --> 22:00.961
Now do it.

22:00.963 --> 22:02.062
Do it.

22:03.966 --> 22:05.065
Come on, do it!

22:05.067 --> 22:06.168
Do it, do it!

22:07.470 --> 22:08.302
Shoot him.

22:08.304 --> 22:09.136
Come on, shoot him.

22:09.138 --> 22:09.970
Shoot him.

22:09.972 --> 22:12.139
Shoot this fucking
piece of shit.

22:12.141 --> 22:12.973
Do it!

22:12.975 --> 22:13.807
No!

22:13.809 --> 22:14.640
No!

22:14.642 --> 22:15.576
We're not killing him, okay?

22:15.578 --> 22:18.011
We're not killing him!

22:18.013 --> 22:19.849
You sure about that?

22:21.283 --> 22:22.516
Jackie, put the gun down.

22:22.518 --> 22:23.749
You could make things right,
Jackie.

22:23.751 --> 22:25.018
Jackie.

22:25.020 --> 22:25.821
Hey, hey.

22:26.754 --> 22:27.921
Put the gun down,
we'll get the money

22:27.923 --> 22:29.790
from somewhere else, Jackie.

22:29.792 --> 22:31.892
There is nowhere else, Mickey.

22:31.894 --> 22:34.128
It's the only way to set us
straight with Tony.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.628
Jackie, we don't have to do
this.

22:35.630 --> 22:36.463
Put the gun down.

22:36.465 --> 22:37.598
Come on, what, do you wanna be

22:37.600 --> 22:38.866
a fucking pussy your whole life?

22:38.868 --> 22:39.867
This isn't us, Jackie.

22:39.869 --> 22:40.901
Put the gun down.

22:40.903 --> 22:41.734
Jackie.

22:41.736 --> 22:42.836
You could put an
end to all this.

22:42.838 --> 22:43.703
Put the gun down.

22:43.705 --> 22:44.838
Put the fucking gun down.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.671
End this!

22:45.673 --> 22:47.040
End it!

22:47.042 --> 22:48.108
Fucking shoot him.

22:48.110 --> 22:48.942
Shoot him.

22:48.944 --> 22:49.776
Come on!

22:49.778 --> 22:50.676
Fucking end this, man!

22:50.678 --> 22:51.512
Nah!

22:51.514 --> 22:52.348
No, fuck.

22:53.482 --> 22:54.749
Mickey's right.

22:56.352 --> 22:58.585
We're gonna find another way.

22:58.587 --> 22:59.987
There is no other fucking way.

23:07.163 --> 23:08.564
Fuck's sake, man.

23:10.633 --> 23:12.366
Get a fucking hold of yourself.

23:12.368 --> 23:15.037
Act like you fucking own a pair.

23:17.039 --> 23:18.071
Aw fuck.

23:18.073 --> 23:19.175
Jesus Christ.

23:20.209 --> 23:21.041
Shit.

23:21.043 --> 23:21.842
What?

23:21.844 --> 23:22.675
What the fuck?

23:22.677 --> 23:23.512
No!

23:25.381 --> 23:26.513
What did you just do?

23:26.515 --> 23:27.514
You just buried us!

23:27.516 --> 23:28.348
He was about to shoot the kid!

23:28.350 --> 23:29.183
You fucking buried us!

23:29.185 --> 23:30.217
He was about to shoot the kid!

23:32.087 --> 23:33.287
Oh fuck!

23:33.289 --> 23:34.354
Oh shit.

23:34.356 --> 23:35.455
Oh shit.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.523
Shit, shit.

23:36.525 --> 23:38.458
She just killed Joey Divalo.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.928
Oh sweet Mary Mother of God, no.

23:40.930 --> 23:41.895
This is all your fault!

23:41.897 --> 23:43.197
Don't pin this on me!

23:43.199 --> 23:45.199
Just shut up!

23:45.201 --> 23:46.033
Take it easy.

23:46.035 --> 23:46.867
Take it easy.

23:46.869 --> 23:47.901
We didn't shoot your father.

23:47.903 --> 23:48.768
We didn't shoot your father.

23:48.770 --> 23:50.504
Take it easy.

23:50.506 --> 23:51.605
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

23:51.607 --> 23:53.140
Lower the gun, sweetheart.

23:53.142 --> 23:55.075
Do not call me sweetheart!

23:55.077 --> 23:56.643
I am not your sweetheart!

23:56.645 --> 23:57.611
Okay, okay.

23:57.613 --> 23:58.912
What do you want us to call you
then, huh?

23:58.914 --> 24:00.347
Why do you wanna know my name?

24:00.349 --> 24:02.249
So we can call you something
other than sweetheart.

24:02.251 --> 24:05.521
And you'll stop pointing the
gun at us.

24:06.555 --> 24:08.155
It's Clover.

24:08.157 --> 24:09.423
Okay, Clover.

24:09.425 --> 24:10.390
That's a pretty name.

24:10.392 --> 24:11.724
We didn't shoot you father.

24:11.726 --> 24:12.893
That was that guy, Joey.

24:12.895 --> 24:14.561
Listen to me, your father was a
deadbeat, okay?

24:14.563 --> 24:15.996
So don't blame any of this on
us, all right?

24:15.998 --> 24:17.197
Jackie, will you please shut up?

24:17.199 --> 24:18.031
What?

24:18.033 --> 24:18.865
Clover, don't listen to my
brother.

24:18.867 --> 24:19.700
He's special, he don't know

24:19.702 --> 24:20.601
what he's saying half the time.

24:20.603 --> 24:21.969
Oh cute, Mick.

24:21.971 --> 24:23.403
Clover, Tony Divalo.

24:23.405 --> 24:25.439
Tony Divalo, does that name
ring a bell to you?

24:25.441 --> 24:27.574
Okay, he's an evil man, and we
owe money

24:27.576 --> 24:30.210
to him just like
your father did.

24:30.212 --> 24:31.645
So you're deadbeats too.

24:31.647 --> 24:32.679
No.

24:32.681 --> 24:33.547
Yeah.

24:33.549 --> 24:34.548
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

24:34.550 --> 24:35.515
Speak for yourself.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.384
Jackie, will you please shut up?

24:37.386 --> 24:39.386
Clover, they forced us to come
here.

24:39.388 --> 24:40.420
If we didn't do what they said

24:40.422 --> 24:42.222
they were gonna hurt us too.

24:42.224 --> 24:43.724
Well I don't believe you.

24:43.726 --> 24:44.925
What do you want us to say, huh?

24:44.927 --> 24:45.792
What do you want me to say?

24:45.794 --> 24:46.627
You want me to call the cops?

24:46.629 --> 24:47.728
We can call the cops right now.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.096
Are you out of your freakin'
skull?

24:49.098 --> 24:50.597
We'll be dead before we get to
the freakin' prison.

24:50.599 --> 24:51.431
Joey!

24:51.433 --> 24:52.499
Joey!

24:52.501 --> 24:53.333
Come on, where you at?

24:53.335 --> 24:54.301
Who's that?

24:54.303 --> 24:55.168
Who else is here?

24:55.170 --> 24:56.536
Is your mother here?

24:56.538 --> 24:57.571
She's dead.

24:57.573 --> 24:59.573
Shhh everyone.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.714
Joey!

25:10.419 --> 25:11.253
Joey!

25:12.855 --> 25:14.655
Joey, it's Dom!

25:14.657 --> 25:16.923
Supposed to pick up three
packages!

25:16.925 --> 25:17.858
Come on, where you at?

25:17.860 --> 25:21.030
The old man wants this done
yesterday!

25:21.997 --> 25:22.863
Oh fuck!

25:22.865 --> 25:24.131
Frankie, what the fuck you
doing?

25:24.133 --> 25:25.299
Trying to get yourself killed?

25:25.301 --> 25:27.234
Dom, the door was busted open.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.268
Where's Joey?

25:28.270 --> 25:29.469
I don't know where Joey is.

25:29.471 --> 25:31.972
You're supposed to be here with
him!

25:31.974 --> 25:33.473
The old lady was having a false
alarm.

25:33.475 --> 25:34.975
What do you want from me?

25:34.977 --> 25:36.443
Make yourself useful, let's
find him.

25:36.445 --> 25:37.644
Find him, Frankie.

25:37.646 --> 25:38.879
Don't go all day.

25:38.881 --> 25:39.781
It's Dom.

25:39.783 --> 25:41.048
And you know what Dom does.

25:41.050 --> 25:42.885
He cleans up the mess.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.153
And we're the mess.

25:46.155 --> 25:47.821
It's frickin' empty.

25:47.823 --> 25:51.091
Those lying, greasy,
backstabbing motherfuckers!

25:51.093 --> 25:51.925
Watch your language.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.126
She just shot someone in the
face,

25:53.128 --> 25:55.462
you think she cares about an
F-bomb?

25:55.464 --> 25:56.396
We're dead.

25:56.398 --> 25:57.397
Tony's gonna put this on us.

25:57.399 --> 25:58.365
Are you stupid, Mick?

25:58.367 --> 25:59.633
We were already dead.

25:59.635 --> 26:01.134
That was supposed to be us.

26:01.136 --> 26:02.636
He said I was a good boy.

26:02.638 --> 26:03.737
Hey!

26:03.739 --> 26:06.440
Do you wanna continue whining
like two old ladies,

26:06.442 --> 26:08.141
or do you wanna act like grown
men

26:08.143 --> 26:10.312
and follow me out of here?

26:16.952 --> 26:17.787
Let's go!

26:20.222 --> 26:21.088
This is your fault.

26:21.090 --> 26:23.423
This is your fucking fault.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.371
What are you doing?

26:37.373 --> 26:38.271
What are you doing?

26:38.273 --> 26:39.373
Clover, come on, we can't stop.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.273
We gotta keep moving.

26:40.275 --> 26:41.108
Just let her go.

26:41.110 --> 26:41.942
What?

26:41.944 --> 26:42.777
No Jackie, we're not leaving

26:42.779 --> 26:43.710
the kid out here on the street.

26:43.712 --> 26:44.513
Car.

26:45.849 --> 26:46.850
Come here.

26:49.451 --> 26:50.951
Come on Mickey, we're sitting
ducks out here.

26:50.953 --> 26:51.788
Let's go.

26:53.055 --> 26:54.421
Listen, Clover.

26:54.423 --> 26:55.589
We can't keep walking around
the street.

26:55.591 --> 26:56.423
It's too dangerous.

26:56.425 --> 26:57.691
Do you understand?

26:57.693 --> 26:58.525
Fine!

26:58.527 --> 26:59.760
Smarten up, man.

26:59.762 --> 27:01.628
This kid's gonna get us whacked.

27:01.630 --> 27:05.067
This is all your fucking fault,
Jackie!

27:12.274 --> 27:13.108
Fuck me.

27:14.743 --> 27:16.979
This ain't good, Frankie.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.548
Now you know the drill.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.717
Spic and span, no evidence.

27:23.719 --> 27:24.951
What about Joey?

27:24.953 --> 27:25.952
What are we gonna do with him?

27:25.954 --> 27:27.587
We're gonna get him in the car,

27:27.589 --> 27:28.823
and me and this fucking moron

27:28.825 --> 27:31.024
are gonna bring him back to
Tony.

27:31.026 --> 27:31.861
Hurry up.

27:33.897 --> 27:35.328
Yeah, more hard work.

27:35.330 --> 27:36.763
Like I'm a friggin' maid.

27:36.765 --> 27:38.398
What was that?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.533
Did you say something, Alfie?

27:39.535 --> 27:40.367
Huh?

27:40.369 --> 27:41.435
You say something?

27:41.437 --> 27:43.537
I'll put you in another fucking
bag, you hear me?

27:43.539 --> 27:46.306
You think any of us wanna
fucking do this?

27:46.308 --> 27:48.043
Get your fucking mop.

27:49.144 --> 27:50.979
And hurry the fuck up.

27:57.753 --> 27:58.585
Yeah, it's Frankie.

27:58.587 --> 27:59.887
Alert the crew.

27:59.889 --> 28:01.588
The Belfast packages?

28:01.590 --> 28:03.927
Yeah, well finder's keepers.

28:04.828 --> 28:06.395
Find those McFucks.

28:10.666 --> 28:11.500
Fuck.

28:15.170 --> 28:18.371
Don't make me look like a jerk.

28:18.373 --> 28:20.373
Standing there.

28:54.944 --> 28:55.776
You okay?

28:55.778 --> 28:56.676
Yeah.

28:56.678 --> 28:57.711
Mickey, I need to go to the
bathroom.

28:57.713 --> 28:58.714
All right.

29:00.749 --> 29:01.583
Hey.

29:02.518 --> 29:03.352
Hey!

29:04.653 --> 29:05.485
Yeah?

29:05.487 --> 29:08.688
Let me get a shot of whiskey.

29:08.690 --> 29:09.591
Pat around?

29:11.527 --> 29:12.559
Who's asking?

29:12.561 --> 29:13.897
The Callahans.

29:14.763 --> 29:17.566
That supposed to mean something?

29:18.567 --> 29:20.133
Come here.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.869
Just make the fucking call, or
I'm gonna

29:21.871 --> 29:23.403
take this glass and I'm gonna

29:23.405 --> 29:26.041
bounce it off your fucking head.

29:36.418 --> 29:37.684
Go on back tough guy.

29:37.686 --> 29:38.520
Yeah.

29:40.088 --> 29:40.988
What's up?

29:40.990 --> 29:41.923
Back office.

29:41.925 --> 29:43.356
I need to use the bathroom.

29:43.358 --> 29:44.491
All right, fuck.

29:44.493 --> 29:48.230
I'll take her to the bathroom,
you go to Pat.

30:03.913 --> 30:05.947
Yeah, it's me.

30:15.058 --> 30:18.025
Well aren't you a sight for
sore eyes.

30:18.027 --> 30:19.159
Come here, you.

30:19.161 --> 30:20.962
It's good to see you, Pat.

30:22.932 --> 30:25.699
I missed that handsome face.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.233
Where's the sweet one?

30:27.235 --> 30:28.470
The bathroom.

30:29.872 --> 30:30.706
Uh-oh.

30:31.841 --> 30:34.674
What kind of shit you got
yourself into now?

30:34.676 --> 30:36.178
You got no idea.

30:38.014 --> 30:40.580
It's never a dull moment with
you two.

30:40.582 --> 30:41.416
Sit down.

30:50.525 --> 30:53.293
You okay in there?

30:53.295 --> 30:54.529
Jesus Christ.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.999
Did anybody follow you here?

30:58.001 --> 30:58.966
No.

30:58.968 --> 31:00.433
You better be for goddamn sure.

31:00.435 --> 31:01.668
I'm positive, nobody saw us.

31:01.670 --> 31:02.669
Relax.

31:02.671 --> 31:04.137
You want me to fucking relax?

31:04.139 --> 31:06.172
I am far from relaxed!

31:06.174 --> 31:10.610
The last thing I need is Tony
Divalo peeping up my skirt.

31:10.612 --> 31:12.445
I've never seen you wear a
skirt.

31:12.447 --> 31:13.580
Say one more word, I'm gonna

31:13.582 --> 31:16.251
slap every tooth out your mouth.

31:17.452 --> 31:20.553
I mean what the hell were y'all
thinking?

31:20.555 --> 31:22.890
You know better than going to
see those animals.

31:22.892 --> 31:24.792
Actually, that's an insult to
animals.

31:24.794 --> 31:28.095
They're more like pasta-eating
fucking maggots.

31:28.097 --> 31:28.931
I know.

31:30.165 --> 31:31.631
We messed up.

31:31.633 --> 31:34.001
Jackie, why wouldn't y'all just
come to me?

31:34.003 --> 31:35.435
I'm family.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.469
It was too much, Pat.

31:36.471 --> 31:38.473
I didn't think we could.

31:40.977 --> 31:42.912
We'll never know now.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.650
Are you sure he's dead?

31:50.652 --> 31:51.952
I seen his brains all over

31:51.954 --> 31:54.487
the fucking ground, he's dead.

31:54.489 --> 31:56.289
Not that I will lose any sleep
over it.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.259
That kid was a first class
prick.

31:59.261 --> 32:01.494
You know that old man's not
gonna rest.

32:01.496 --> 32:03.196
He's not gonna sleep until he
knows

32:03.198 --> 32:05.166
that you are six feet under,
and I'll be laying

32:05.168 --> 32:08.201
right next to you if he thinks
I helped you.

32:08.203 --> 32:10.104
We didn't kill Joey.

32:10.106 --> 32:12.108
It's all the same now.

32:13.241 --> 32:15.178
You gonna wish you had.

32:29.391 --> 32:30.225
Clover!

32:34.097 --> 32:36.163
Clover, open the door!

32:36.165 --> 32:37.230
What is your problem?

32:37.232 --> 32:38.498
Are you some kind of pervert?

32:38.500 --> 32:39.332
Let go of my arm!

32:39.334 --> 32:40.201
Shh, shh!

32:40.203 --> 32:41.202
Listen to me.

32:41.204 --> 32:42.635
There are armed men that wanna
kill us here.

32:42.637 --> 32:45.407
Listen to what I say and come
on.

32:46.475 --> 32:47.307
Let go of me!

32:47.309 --> 32:48.142
Shh!

32:49.011 --> 32:50.179
It's Mickey!

32:51.848 --> 32:52.712
Open up!

32:52.714 --> 32:53.548
Come on!

32:55.650 --> 32:56.483
They're here.

32:56.485 --> 32:57.317
What?

32:57.319 --> 32:58.451
You two.

32:58.453 --> 33:00.253
I told you Jackie, you're gonna
be the death of me yet.

33:00.255 --> 33:01.387
How in the hell did they find
us?

33:01.389 --> 33:02.422
I don't know, Jackie.

33:02.424 --> 33:03.256
How many?

33:03.258 --> 33:04.357
I count three of them.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.227
Handsome Pete, Big Fat Paulie,
and some other guy.

33:06.229 --> 33:08.328
Come here baby, come here.

33:08.330 --> 33:09.729
You're gonna be all right,
little lady.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.464
Miss Pat's gonna get you out of
here safe and sound.

33:11.466 --> 33:13.000
Now what I need you to do is go
to that door,

33:13.002 --> 33:15.401
I need you to look through that
slide, okay baby?

33:15.403 --> 33:16.536
All right, look through that
slide

33:16.538 --> 33:17.805
and tell me if you see anybody.

33:17.807 --> 33:19.539
You see anybody?

33:19.541 --> 33:20.775
No, the coast is clear.

33:20.777 --> 33:21.842
Good job, baby.

33:21.844 --> 33:23.110
Nobody's getting killed in my
bar

33:23.112 --> 33:24.245
unless I want them killed.

33:25.081 --> 33:26.412
Shit.

33:26.414 --> 33:27.447
Open up.

33:27.449 --> 33:28.681
Back door, now!

33:28.683 --> 33:29.482
Fuck!

33:29.484 --> 33:31.351
Open the door.

33:32.287 --> 33:33.120
What about you?

33:33.122 --> 33:33.954
Knock knock.

33:33.956 --> 33:34.955
This is my house.

33:34.957 --> 33:35.790
I am not leaving.

33:35.792 --> 33:36.924
This is what you came for.

33:36.926 --> 33:37.724
What are you doing?

33:37.726 --> 33:38.793
We're not leaving without you.

33:38.795 --> 33:40.861
Look, get this kid out of here
and go.

33:40.863 --> 33:41.728
Pat.

33:41.730 --> 33:43.097
Don't make me ask you again,
Jackie.

33:43.099 --> 33:44.597
Move your ass.

33:44.599 --> 33:45.833
Go!

33:45.835 --> 33:46.967
Next round's on me.

33:46.969 --> 33:48.468
You better fucking believe it.

33:48.470 --> 33:50.303
Open the door or I'm gonna kick
it down!

33:50.305 --> 33:51.140
Go!

33:53.009 --> 33:55.778
Open the fucking door!

34:13.196 --> 34:16.132
Get back here, you
motherfuckers!

34:35.985 --> 34:36.886
Ho ho ho!

34:38.888 --> 34:40.486
There is a Sixth Burrow

34:40.488 --> 34:42.992
train approaching the station.

34:45.895 --> 34:47.395
Fuck outta here.

35:02.211 --> 35:03.978
Where's the train?

35:03.980 --> 35:05.480
Gotta catch the...

35:08.150 --> 35:09.582
Out of the way!

35:09.584 --> 35:10.951
Oh fuck!

35:10.953 --> 35:12.219
Damn it, Paulie!

35:12.221 --> 35:14.822
Not my fault, motherfucker!

35:14.824 --> 35:16.092
You see them?

35:18.426 --> 35:23.063
Stand clear of the closing
doors please.

35:23.065 --> 35:25.465
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

35:25.467 --> 35:26.733
That was a cheap shot!

35:26.735 --> 35:28.302
Mind your manners!

35:28.304 --> 35:29.771
Mind your manners!

35:31.673 --> 35:34.074
Oh, look who it is.

35:34.076 --> 35:35.776
The Irish twins.

35:35.778 --> 35:38.078
Don't you two owe
me fucking money?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.248
Get in line!

35:42.051 --> 35:43.516
Fuck you!

36:11.513 --> 36:12.578
What's it been, a year?

36:12.580 --> 36:14.815
I don't know, who's counting?

36:14.817 --> 36:15.950
She still pissed at you?

36:15.952 --> 36:17.217
She's still pissed at you.

36:17.219 --> 36:18.052
I don't know.

36:18.054 --> 36:19.153
I don't know why she would.

36:19.155 --> 36:20.154
I mean it is what it is.

36:20.156 --> 36:22.325
Oh I know why she would.

36:24.327 --> 36:25.159
Angie.

36:25.161 --> 36:26.693
Look at you.

36:26.695 --> 36:28.431
You look like a ruby.

36:29.698 --> 36:34.335
Are you seriously standing in
my doorway right now?

36:34.337 --> 36:35.836
Yeah.

36:35.838 --> 36:37.037
Hold on, Ang.

36:37.039 --> 36:38.105
Listen.

36:38.107 --> 36:39.239
I'm in a spot, all right?

36:39.241 --> 36:40.707
I need a place to lay low.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.776
If your brain were as big as
your balls, Jackie...

36:42.778 --> 36:43.609
Ang, I'm serious.

36:43.611 --> 36:44.677
I'm in trouble.

36:44.679 --> 36:46.313
What world do you live in that
makes you

36:46.315 --> 36:48.916
think I would even try to help
you out?

36:48.918 --> 36:51.151
And how the hell do you know
where I live?

36:51.153 --> 36:52.453
Did Pat tell you?

36:52.455 --> 36:53.720
She was only trying to help.

36:53.722 --> 36:55.488
Okay, well I'm gonna fucking
kill her when I see her.

36:55.490 --> 36:58.491
Well you may not have to.

36:58.493 --> 37:01.362
What did you do, Jackie?

37:01.364 --> 37:02.196
Hi.

37:02.198 --> 37:03.364
I'm Clover.

37:03.366 --> 37:04.465
They killed my father.

37:04.467 --> 37:05.299
What?

37:05.301 --> 37:06.133
Jesus, Jackie!

37:06.135 --> 37:07.368
No we didn't.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.634
That's still up for debate.

37:08.636 --> 37:09.602
There's no debate, all right?

37:09.604 --> 37:10.471
We didn't kill him.

37:10.473 --> 37:11.405
That's what you say.

37:11.407 --> 37:14.308
Okay, Ang, Tony Divalo
wants us dead.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.275
Okay?

37:15.277 --> 37:16.844
Have it in your heart, for the
love of God.

37:16.846 --> 37:19.780
I know he's an idiot,
but it's a kid.

37:19.782 --> 37:20.615
Come on.

37:26.521 --> 37:31.691
Just so we're clear, I'm not
doing this for you, or him.

37:31.693 --> 37:32.625
You are an angel.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.696
Yeah, I don't think so.

37:35.597 --> 37:36.397
One night.

37:36.399 --> 37:37.563
You have one night.

37:37.565 --> 37:38.432
Okay.

37:38.434 --> 37:39.433
I really appreciate it from the
bottom...

37:39.435 --> 37:42.302
Let's just stop with the
pleasantries, Mickey.

37:42.304 --> 37:43.569
This is a nice apartment though.

37:43.571 --> 37:44.407
Stop.

37:49.879 --> 37:54.281
DJ Cass is dropping bombs on
your area.

37:54.283 --> 37:57.785
Why are we cowering and running
from these jerkoffs?

37:57.787 --> 38:01.221
I think it's time we grow a
fucking pair.

38:01.223 --> 38:02.956
I don't know how much I'm
cowering,

38:02.958 --> 38:05.392
but since I like breathing
above ground,

38:05.394 --> 38:08.362
I have no problem with my feet
hitting the pavement.

38:08.364 --> 38:10.431
Oh, so you wanna go on the lamb

38:10.433 --> 38:12.199
for the rest of our lives?

38:12.201 --> 38:14.667
If it equates to living, then
yeah.

38:14.669 --> 38:16.370
Yeah, I'll keep running for the
rest of my life.

38:16.372 --> 38:18.338
You call that living?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.940
I call it surviving.

38:19.942 --> 38:24.113
Yeah, well see, me, I say we go
on the defensive

38:24.947 --> 38:27.481
and kill each and every one of
those motherfuckers.

38:27.483 --> 38:29.983
Get them before they get us.

38:29.985 --> 38:31.385
It's offensive, you fucking
idiot.

38:31.387 --> 38:32.221
Offensive.

38:33.389 --> 38:35.222
That's what I meant.

38:35.224 --> 38:37.424
I mean just like you
and me.

38:37.426 --> 38:38.358
Joey did.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.725
Did I say that you
could have a beer?

38:39.727 --> 38:40.561
I'm sorry.

38:40.563 --> 38:41.395
I thought because...

38:41.397 --> 38:42.362
That's the problem.

38:42.364 --> 38:44.098
You're thinking again.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.665
Where's the kid?

38:45.667 --> 38:46.632
She's in my room.

38:46.634 --> 38:49.303
Poor thing's exhausted.

38:49.305 --> 38:53.641
All right, can I take a shower
and use your phone?

38:58.547 --> 39:00.646
Nothing like an ice cold beer.

39:00.648 --> 39:02.950
So good, am I right?

39:02.952 --> 39:04.551
Did you want one, Mickey?

39:04.553 --> 39:05.385
What?

39:05.387 --> 39:06.520
No.

39:06.522 --> 39:07.521
I wanna take a shower and use
your phone, which I just

39:07.523 --> 39:09.857
asked you and you just
blatantly ignored me.

39:09.859 --> 39:11.691
When did you become so uptight?

39:11.693 --> 39:13.260
When I did get uptight?

39:13.262 --> 39:14.862
Hmm, let me think about that,
Angie.

39:14.864 --> 39:15.728
Oh I remember.

39:15.730 --> 39:16.997
I remember, when I
had I don't know

39:16.999 --> 39:18.432
how many people's blood on me

39:18.434 --> 39:19.765
and Tony Divalo put an
expiration date

39:19.767 --> 39:23.103
on me and my moronic
fucking brother.

39:23.105 --> 39:24.704
One less Jackie Callahan
in the world

39:24.706 --> 39:26.706
might not be such a bad thing.

39:26.708 --> 39:27.541
You know what?

39:27.543 --> 39:29.376
That's just fucking rude.

39:29.378 --> 39:30.210
Lighten up.

39:30.212 --> 39:31.845
You might live a little longer.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.349
And keep it local.

39:38.753 --> 39:41.088
I think you miss me.

39:43.359 --> 39:44.657
Okay.

39:50.966 --> 39:52.566
I fucking hate you.

39:52.568 --> 39:54.767
I fucking love you.

39:57.239 --> 39:58.939
Hey where is the,
oh Jesus Christ,

39:58.941 --> 40:01.842
it never ends with you two.

40:01.844 --> 40:02.643
Stevie.

40:02.645 --> 40:04.378
Stevie, how long do I know you?

40:04.380 --> 40:08.615
Right, so when I say something's not
good, it's not good.

40:08.617 --> 40:10.884
Okay, I don't have time to wait.

40:10.886 --> 40:11.852
So just get here.

40:11.854 --> 40:12.718
When, now?

40:12.720 --> 40:13.554
Yup.

40:13.556 --> 40:14.421
Okay.

40:14.423 --> 40:15.424
Okay, bye.

40:22.865 --> 40:23.698
Hey.

40:25.935 --> 40:28.268
Are you all right?

40:28.270 --> 40:29.870
No, I'm not all right.

40:29.872 --> 40:32.339
I wanna go back to my dad's.

40:32.341 --> 40:35.578
I don't wanna be here,
I wanna go home.

40:37.745 --> 40:40.113
You can't go home, okay?

40:40.115 --> 40:41.415
It's not safe.

40:41.417 --> 40:42.251
I'm sorry.

40:43.319 --> 40:44.551
For how long?

40:44.553 --> 40:46.253
I don't know.

40:46.255 --> 40:47.256
Maybe never.

40:48.457 --> 40:49.923
We gotta get you
somewhere far away

40:49.925 --> 40:52.826
where they're not
gonna find you.

40:52.828 --> 40:53.896
Like where?

40:55.064 --> 40:58.632
Don't you have any relatives we
could take you to?

40:58.634 --> 40:59.933
No.

40:59.935 --> 41:03.070
What about family friends or...

41:03.072 --> 41:04.605
Nope.

41:04.607 --> 41:06.873
Just my dad and me.

41:06.875 --> 41:09.278
Who knows where my mother is.

41:10.613 --> 41:13.782
Didn't you say your
mother was dead?

41:15.384 --> 41:17.553
Well she is to me, okay?

41:20.055 --> 41:23.523
That's a pretty harsh thing to
say, kid.

41:23.525 --> 41:24.360
No.

41:25.194 --> 41:26.028
It's not.

41:27.096 --> 41:30.697
She left me at a park when I
was nine years old.

41:30.699 --> 41:34.870
Said she'd be right back, but
she never came back.

41:36.538 --> 41:37.971
Well maybe something
happened to her.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.873
You don't know.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.808
Yeah, like she didn't wanna be
a mom anymore.

41:41.810 --> 41:43.243
That's what happened.

41:43.245 --> 41:45.078
Come on, I don't think a mother

41:45.080 --> 41:46.780
would leave her child at a
park, you know?

41:46.782 --> 41:48.115
She called my dad about
a month later,

41:48.117 --> 41:50.886
said she wasn't coming home
okay?

41:52.354 --> 41:55.791
She said she wasn't fit to
raise a child.

41:56.692 --> 41:59.326
Said it didn't feel natural.

41:59.328 --> 42:00.996
Whatever that means.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.167
That's a bad beat.

42:07.169 --> 42:08.502
I'm sorry.

42:08.504 --> 42:10.103
I'm not.

42:10.105 --> 42:11.338
I hate her.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.873
And I hate what she
did to my dad.

42:12.875 --> 42:15.644
He was never the
same after that.

42:18.547 --> 42:19.381
You know.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.918
It wasn't his fault.

42:24.119 --> 42:25.652
What wasn't?

42:25.654 --> 42:29.189
The money he borrowed
wasn't for him.

42:29.191 --> 42:30.092
Hey, kid.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.260
Don't do that to yourself.

42:33.262 --> 42:35.195
Don't carry that kind
of guilt around.

42:35.197 --> 42:36.532
It's too late.

42:39.268 --> 42:40.102
Hey.

42:41.303 --> 42:43.603
We're gonna get you
somewhere safe.

42:43.605 --> 42:44.440
I promise.

42:45.307 --> 42:48.377
We're not gonna let anybody
hurt you.

42:49.779 --> 42:52.047
Try to get some rest, okay?

43:01.825 --> 43:03.590
Fucking animals.

43:03.592 --> 43:05.594
Shot my boy in the face.

43:07.696 --> 43:09.264
Degenerate McFucks.

43:12.501 --> 43:13.335
Boss.

43:14.403 --> 43:18.672
Over on Lynnewood, there's
Venetta's Funeral Home.

43:18.674 --> 43:21.007
When Jimmy Deweese got
his head blow off by

43:21.009 --> 43:25.545
the Boscombe Brothers, they
made him look like a prince.

43:25.547 --> 43:26.380
Is that right?

43:26.382 --> 43:27.280
Yeah.

43:27.282 --> 43:29.716
I mean they can do
miracles over there.

43:29.718 --> 43:30.550
Miracles?

43:30.552 --> 43:32.018
Yeah.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.755
My boy's got a bullet in his
fucking forehead.

43:34.757 --> 43:37.324
His brains are in a fucking jar.

43:37.326 --> 43:41.194
What kind of miracles they
gonna do for him, huh?

43:41.196 --> 43:44.364
Are they gonna bring
him back to life?

43:44.366 --> 43:45.934
No, I don't know.

43:47.002 --> 43:48.568
No.

43:50.606 --> 43:52.840
You know what,
I got a better idea.

43:52.842 --> 43:55.509
Why don't we replace the part
of his skull

43:55.511 --> 43:58.378
that's missing with this part
right here?

43:58.380 --> 44:00.647
Dom, put him in the chair.

44:00.649 --> 44:01.883
What are you talking about, the
chair?

44:01.885 --> 44:02.682
Shut up!

44:02.684 --> 44:03.517
Dom...

44:03.519 --> 44:04.351
You were supposed to back up

44:04.353 --> 44:06.553
Joey tonight, but you didn't
did you?

44:06.555 --> 44:07.421
Boss, I'm sorry.

44:07.423 --> 44:08.722
What the fuck do you
want from me?

44:08.724 --> 44:10.157
I called Joey.

44:10.159 --> 44:11.992
My wife was in labor, he said

44:11.994 --> 44:13.560
he could fucking handle it!

44:13.562 --> 44:15.529
Does this look handled to you?

44:15.531 --> 44:16.363
No.

44:16.365 --> 44:18.665
I fucked up, I'm sorry.

44:18.667 --> 44:19.499
Huh?

44:19.501 --> 44:20.333
No, Tony!

44:20.335 --> 44:21.501
Does it look fucking handled?

44:21.503 --> 44:22.436
No, all right?

44:22.438 --> 44:23.537
What do you want me to do?

44:23.539 --> 44:25.472
I was about to have a fucking
baby last night!

44:25.474 --> 44:26.808
Tell him, please Pete!

44:26.810 --> 44:29.209
Petey, you were there, fucking
say something, please!

44:29.211 --> 44:31.311
Fucking Dom, say something okay?

44:31.313 --> 44:32.679
I can't help you, Frank.

44:32.681 --> 44:33.713
Please, Dom!

44:33.715 --> 44:35.215
I'm married to your cousin,
for Christ's sake!

44:35.217 --> 44:36.249
Say something!

44:36.251 --> 44:38.853
My cousin doesn't even like
you, Frank.

44:38.855 --> 44:39.854
Dom.

44:39.856 --> 44:42.255
What are you, Petey, just
fucking tell him...

44:42.257 --> 44:43.759
Shut your mouth!

44:45.929 --> 44:49.364
Because of you, I have to go
home tonight

44:50.199 --> 44:53.300
and tell my wife that
her first born

44:53.302 --> 44:56.136
is gonna be buried
in a closed casket.

44:56.138 --> 44:58.840
Because of you, I gotta
tell my son's

44:58.842 --> 45:01.041
baby girl that she'll never have

45:01.043 --> 45:03.778
a birthday with her father
again.

45:03.780 --> 45:06.379
And because of you, the Divalo
name,

45:06.381 --> 45:08.381
this name that's been around
since

45:08.383 --> 45:10.954
the fall of Rome, dies with me!

45:13.890 --> 45:15.388
I'm begging you, Tony, please.

45:15.390 --> 45:16.924
Jesus Christ, I'm begging you.

45:16.926 --> 45:18.325
I'm about to be a father.

45:18.327 --> 45:19.159
Please.

45:19.161 --> 45:20.862
Not anymore, you ain't.

45:20.864 --> 45:23.129
Tony, please, Jesus...

45:40.415 --> 45:42.817
Put the word out on the street.

45:42.819 --> 45:45.051
There's a cash reward.

45:45.053 --> 45:48.923
Anybody brings me those
degenerate motherfucking micks,

45:48.925 --> 45:52.425
I want them three breaths
before dead.

45:52.427 --> 45:56.429
I'm gonna kill them myself with
my hands.

45:56.431 --> 45:58.033
Clean up this mess.

46:03.639 --> 46:04.738
Let's wrap him up.

46:04.740 --> 46:05.574
Come on.

46:10.947 --> 46:12.782
Jesus Christ.

46:15.684 --> 46:16.518
What?

46:17.419 --> 46:19.419
Holy shit, you two.

46:19.421 --> 46:22.157
I mean you guys are
unbelievable.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.793
You never cease to amaze me.

46:25.795 --> 46:28.695
If our dads knew
what you two did

46:28.697 --> 46:30.597
to the bar, they would be doing

46:30.599 --> 46:32.499
backflips in their fucking
graves right now.

46:32.501 --> 46:33.700
You know what, spare me the
bullshit.

46:33.702 --> 46:34.701
Bullshit?

46:34.703 --> 46:36.037
Yeah, you're the one who
wanted to be a cop.

46:36.039 --> 46:37.939
You didn't want anything
to do with the bar.

46:37.941 --> 46:39.807
And you wonder why?

46:39.809 --> 46:40.908
Oh is that right, Stevie?

46:40.910 --> 46:41.741
Yeah.

46:41.743 --> 46:43.143
Okay, 'cause if I remember,

46:43.145 --> 46:46.279
you didn't have the fondest
memories right?

46:46.281 --> 46:48.950
I mean didn't happy hour
consist of your

46:48.952 --> 46:51.184
old man using your face as a
punching bag?

46:51.186 --> 46:52.019
Jackie.

46:52.021 --> 46:52.987
I mean what was the nickname

46:52.989 --> 46:54.721
his old man used to call him?

46:54.723 --> 46:55.622
Ashtray.

46:55.624 --> 46:57.090
That's right.

46:57.092 --> 46:59.359
That's right, it was Ashtray,
right?

46:59.361 --> 47:00.560
Yeah.

47:00.562 --> 47:03.430
And you still got the scars on
your hand there don't you?

47:03.432 --> 47:04.331
Yeah, still do.

47:04.333 --> 47:05.498
See them?

47:05.500 --> 47:06.333
Yeah.

47:06.335 --> 47:07.436
Yeah, nice.

47:08.838 --> 47:11.204
Just don't forget who looked
after you, huh?

47:11.206 --> 47:12.140
I get it.

47:12.976 --> 47:15.175
Enough said, all right?

47:15.177 --> 47:16.411
Can we move on?

47:18.747 --> 47:20.447
What are we gonna do?

47:20.449 --> 47:21.548
I don't know.

47:21.550 --> 47:23.017
This is like a catastrophic

47:23.019 --> 47:26.453
pile of shit just
dropped in my lap.

47:26.455 --> 47:27.788
Where's the girl now?

47:27.790 --> 47:29.957
She's in my bedroom sleeping.

47:31.995 --> 47:33.830
And she killed Joey?

47:37.199 --> 47:38.032
Fuck.

47:38.034 --> 47:38.866
All right.

47:38.868 --> 47:40.166
Here we go.

47:40.168 --> 47:41.969
You two stay here.

47:41.971 --> 47:43.403
Wait for my call.

47:43.405 --> 47:45.472
And how long is that gonna be?

47:45.474 --> 47:47.707
Oh jeez Ang, I'm not sure.

47:47.709 --> 47:50.543
I gotta cover up a
homicide and put

47:50.545 --> 47:53.613
a big shit stain on my career,
so I'm not

47:53.615 --> 47:57.250
so good with the
timing right now.

47:57.252 --> 47:59.053
I haven't seen you in a year,
and within

47:59.055 --> 48:01.956
an hour you've managed
to fuck up my life.

48:01.958 --> 48:03.024
Oh is that right?

48:03.026 --> 48:04.290
'Cause I think you were
enjoying yourself

48:04.292 --> 48:05.993
just about an hour
ago weren't you?

48:05.995 --> 48:09.429
All right you two, start
praying.

48:09.431 --> 48:10.764
Let's hope I get you out of
here with your head

48:10.766 --> 48:12.900
still attached to your neck,
all right?

48:36.159 --> 48:37.323
You know, I gotta tell you,

48:37.325 --> 48:39.759
I never hired guys like you two.

48:39.761 --> 48:43.596
I mean no disrespect, you come
very highly recommended.

48:43.598 --> 48:47.267
I usually don't outsource this
kind of work.

48:47.269 --> 48:50.805
I usually like to
keep it in house.

48:50.807 --> 48:55.644
But since I am surrounded by a
bunch of incompetent fucks!

48:58.647 --> 48:59.982
I got no choice.

49:03.953 --> 49:06.286
You guys have kids?

49:06.288 --> 49:07.822
Huh?

49:07.824 --> 49:09.092
Doesn't matter.

49:10.592 --> 49:14.161
You know, Dom lost his kid a
few years ago.

49:14.163 --> 49:17.133
Said he didn't smile for five
years.

49:19.334 --> 49:21.001
They say the worst
thing in the world

49:21.003 --> 49:23.672
is for a parent to lose a child.

49:25.474 --> 49:29.375
One minute they're little
babies in your arms,

49:29.377 --> 49:32.179
the next minute they're laying
in some

49:32.181 --> 49:34.851
funeral parlor shot in the face.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.719
So you can see why I am
incapable

49:39.721 --> 49:42.624
of any rational thinking right
now.

49:45.761 --> 49:48.628
That's why I want this
done in the most

49:48.630 --> 49:51.801
painful, violent way fucking
possible.

49:57.305 --> 49:58.141
Give it.

50:06.883 --> 50:08.581
It will be handled clean.

50:08.583 --> 50:09.582
No mess.

50:09.584 --> 50:11.353
No trace back to you.

50:12.822 --> 50:15.158
You can be a little messy.

50:25.835 --> 50:27.333
Take it easy, ladies.

50:27.335 --> 50:30.204
We're all playing for the same
team right?

50:30.206 --> 50:31.974
Let them out, people.

50:41.884 --> 50:43.383
Dibs on the blonde.

50:43.385 --> 50:46.187
I still don't understand why
we're leaving right now.

50:46.189 --> 50:47.520
We're leaving because people
are trying

50:47.522 --> 50:49.656
to kill you and that is not
happening in my home.

50:49.658 --> 50:51.192
Can I at least take a leak?

50:51.194 --> 50:52.525
Jackie, listen to what she said,

50:52.527 --> 50:54.261
put your shoe on and let's go!

50:54.263 --> 50:55.361
Now!

50:55.363 --> 50:56.897
Lower your voice, Mick, before
I give you a whack.

50:56.899 --> 50:58.901
All knuckles, all right?

51:02.504 --> 51:04.637
Why are you wearing that?

51:04.639 --> 51:06.606
'Cause I don't have a jacket,
or a home,

51:06.608 --> 51:09.278
or anything else because of you.

51:10.313 --> 51:12.547
Well you look ridiculous.

51:16.252 --> 51:17.885
Hey, where the hell are you?

51:17.887 --> 51:18.986
I'm at your front door.

51:18.988 --> 51:20.054
We just left.

51:20.056 --> 51:20.988
Why would you leave?

51:20.990 --> 51:22.589
Because we didn't feel safe,
Stevie.

51:22.591 --> 51:23.891
All right Ang, well then

51:23.893 --> 51:25.960
where am I meeting you guys?

51:25.962 --> 51:28.295
Remember the Kelly Dwyer
incident?

51:28.297 --> 51:29.797
Buses and taxi cabs?

51:32.335 --> 51:33.167
Yeah.

51:33.169 --> 51:34.168
When?

51:34.170 --> 51:35.535
We're almost there.

51:35.537 --> 51:36.669
All right.

51:36.671 --> 51:37.905
Who's Kelly Dwyer?

51:37.907 --> 51:39.907
She's none of your business,
that's who she is.

51:39.909 --> 51:41.208
Hey, take it easy.

51:41.210 --> 51:42.675
What?

51:42.677 --> 51:45.346
So how well do you trust this
guy Stevie?

51:45.348 --> 51:46.713
We trust him with our lives.

51:46.715 --> 51:48.048
He's like our brother, okay?

51:48.050 --> 51:48.883
Why?

51:48.885 --> 51:50.450
You got something on your mind?

51:50.452 --> 51:52.485
I just like to know what I'm
walking into.

51:52.487 --> 51:54.454
You're walking into an
abandoned train station,

51:54.456 --> 51:55.956
that's what you're walking into.

51:55.958 --> 51:56.824
Yeah.

51:56.826 --> 51:58.524
Are you familiar with the
building?

51:58.526 --> 52:00.094
Do you know how many exits
there are?

52:00.096 --> 52:01.728
What?

52:01.730 --> 52:03.230
What are you talking about?

52:03.232 --> 52:04.865
What kid talks like this?

52:04.867 --> 52:06.367
A kid who doesn't wanna be
backed

52:06.369 --> 52:08.768
into a corner with no way out,
that's who.

52:08.770 --> 52:10.938
Hey, she kinda has a point,
Jackie.

52:10.940 --> 52:12.940
Aw Jesus Christ!

52:12.942 --> 52:13.908
All right!

52:13.910 --> 52:15.075
You and Angie stay in the car.

52:15.077 --> 52:17.011
End of story.

52:17.013 --> 52:17.978
I will.

52:17.980 --> 52:19.280
But not because you said to.

52:19.282 --> 52:20.381
Because I want to.

52:20.383 --> 52:21.882
It's safer.

52:21.884 --> 52:23.152
"End of story."

52:24.353 --> 52:25.652
You know when people
say they don't

52:25.654 --> 52:26.854
like kids but they really like
kids?

52:26.856 --> 52:27.687
Stop, Jackie.

52:27.689 --> 52:30.592
I really don't fucking like
kids.

52:35.064 --> 52:36.964
So what do you think?

52:36.966 --> 52:38.067
Coal or wood?

52:40.937 --> 52:42.568
I say wood.

52:42.570 --> 52:44.271
It's cheaper, it's only half
the cost.

52:44.273 --> 52:45.705
But the coal oven can
get an extra

52:45.707 --> 52:47.607
two to 300 degrees hotter,
which could

52:47.609 --> 52:49.877
could in handy if
we get in a spot.

52:49.879 --> 52:52.413
I mean you and I both know bones

52:52.415 --> 52:54.815
burn better in a coal oven.

52:54.817 --> 52:57.051
That's why I love you.

52:57.053 --> 53:00.254
You're always thinking ahead.

53:00.256 --> 53:02.056
But honestly?

53:02.058 --> 53:03.290
With those high temperatures,

53:03.292 --> 53:06.260
I think we're fine either way.

53:06.262 --> 53:07.527
Fine.

53:07.529 --> 53:09.832
Let's just go with the wood.

53:10.732 --> 53:11.698
Are we pouting now?

53:11.700 --> 53:13.233
No, you're right.

53:13.235 --> 53:15.503
The wood is the smart play.

53:16.738 --> 53:17.805
What's the ETA?

53:17.807 --> 53:18.640
1400.

53:25.547 --> 53:27.316
Does this feel right?

53:28.683 --> 53:31.385
We make the right decision here?

53:31.387 --> 53:33.454
What do you mean?

53:33.456 --> 53:36.125
How long do we let this go on?

53:38.060 --> 53:39.328
'Til the end.

53:42.064 --> 53:43.466
We're in control.

53:52.574 --> 53:55.144
You want me to clean Shirley?

54:00.548 --> 54:03.551
You know what I was just
thinking?

54:04.586 --> 54:08.755
I actually prefer the taste of
the coal over the wood.

54:08.757 --> 54:10.157
Now you're just saying that.

54:10.159 --> 54:11.724
No.

54:11.726 --> 54:13.060
It's more old school.

54:13.062 --> 54:14.660
That's what I'm talking about.

54:14.662 --> 54:17.197
What, are we making pizzas or
roasting marshmallows?

54:17.199 --> 54:18.832
Perfect.

54:18.834 --> 54:20.336
It's settled then.

54:36.118 --> 54:37.750
Where should we wait?

54:37.752 --> 54:39.153
Park off to the left.

54:39.155 --> 54:40.823
All right.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.926
What's wrong with Angie?

54:45.928 --> 54:46.860
Of all the places to meet,

54:46.862 --> 54:48.529
we gotta meet in
this fucking icebox?

54:48.531 --> 54:50.364
Aww, you ain't comfortable,
Jackie?

54:50.366 --> 54:51.899
Come on, it's the old stomping
grounds.

54:51.901 --> 54:55.668
I mean a lot of old memories in
this joint right?

54:55.670 --> 54:57.905
Are you still angry about Kelly
Dwyer?

54:57.907 --> 55:00.007
Is that the problem?

55:00.009 --> 55:01.909
'Cause look, man.

55:01.911 --> 55:04.111
I'm sorry, all right?

55:04.113 --> 55:07.647
Wow, is that an apology from
Jackie Callahan?

55:07.649 --> 55:08.515
Unbelievable.

55:08.517 --> 55:10.750
That only took you 20 years.

55:10.752 --> 55:12.086
Wow.

55:12.088 --> 55:14.421
Apparently you're still not
over it.

55:14.423 --> 55:16.356
And that must be a
new record, Jackie.

55:16.358 --> 55:17.357
What?

55:17.359 --> 55:20.394
The apology lasted four seconds.

55:20.396 --> 55:21.829
Come on, Mick.

55:21.831 --> 55:24.333
I mean I wasn't even into her.

55:32.975 --> 55:34.908
I think we should just leave
and go to the cops.

55:34.910 --> 55:37.578
That's what Mickey and Jackie
are doing right now.

55:37.580 --> 55:40.646
You mean that guy Stevie?

55:40.648 --> 55:42.316
He's not a cop.

55:42.318 --> 55:43.817
He most certainly is.

55:43.819 --> 55:45.385
He's a detective.

55:45.387 --> 55:46.220
Oh.

55:46.222 --> 55:47.187
You think so?

55:47.189 --> 55:48.021
I know so.

55:48.023 --> 55:50.756
I've known him my whole life.

55:50.758 --> 55:51.659
Whatever.

55:53.028 --> 55:55.697
What is that supposed to mean?

55:56.565 --> 55:58.065
You know, I think
it's about time

55:58.067 --> 55:59.800
you start showing a little
appreciation.

55:59.802 --> 56:02.336
Mickey and Jackie are risking
their lives for you.

56:02.338 --> 56:03.871
If it weren't for them I
wouldn't be

56:03.873 --> 56:06.140
in this situation in the first
place.

56:06.142 --> 56:09.576
Clover, if it weren't for them
you'd be dead already.

56:09.578 --> 56:12.579
You know, maybe I have my own
issues with Jackie,

56:12.581 --> 56:16.583
and yes, sometimes I want to
strangle him, trust me.

56:16.585 --> 56:19.388
But he really is a good guy,
okay?

56:20.556 --> 56:21.723
They both are.

56:22.892 --> 56:24.726
As solid as they come.

56:26.095 --> 56:29.762
And I'm really sorry that your
father got killed.

56:29.764 --> 56:30.599
I am.

56:32.001 --> 56:33.766
A kid should never
have to see that

56:33.768 --> 56:36.470
happen to a parent ever.

56:36.472 --> 56:37.871
But Mickey and Jackie were in

56:37.873 --> 56:39.640
the wrong place,
at the wrong time.

56:39.642 --> 56:41.808
They would never hurt anyone
like that, Clover.

56:41.810 --> 56:42.643
Ever.

56:42.645 --> 56:43.711
Not that way.

56:44.580 --> 56:46.113
Yeah, I know.

56:46.115 --> 56:47.614
It's their biggest flaw.

56:47.616 --> 56:49.749
And what's gonna end up getting
them killed.

56:49.751 --> 56:53.353
Personally, I don't wanna be
caught in the crossfire.

56:53.355 --> 56:54.623
Is that Stevie?

56:55.757 --> 56:56.592
There?

56:58.060 --> 56:59.628
Oh, and who's that?

57:00.496 --> 57:01.397
His backup?

57:02.965 --> 57:03.797
Oh my god.

57:03.799 --> 57:05.098
Shit shit shit shit.

57:05.100 --> 57:07.169
You still trust Stevie?

57:13.876 --> 57:17.110
Look at this jerkoff.

57:17.112 --> 57:17.947
You ready?

57:18.881 --> 57:20.681
Yeah, I'm ready.

57:22.384 --> 57:23.716
Let's go.

57:38.801 --> 57:41.068
Stevie better not hang us out
to dry.

57:41.070 --> 57:43.403
He always folded under pressure
when we were kids.

57:43.405 --> 57:47.076
Well he said he'll be here,
he'll be here.

57:50.246 --> 57:52.713
You think he'll give me a gun?

57:52.715 --> 57:53.914
I think you're the last person

57:53.916 --> 57:55.748
Stevie would give a gun to.

57:55.750 --> 57:57.251
Let alone anybody else.

57:57.253 --> 57:59.286
Oh, look who's got his sense of
humor back.

57:59.288 --> 58:02.291
Yeah, well that's
about all I got.

58:15.838 --> 58:16.672
Aw man.

58:20.743 --> 58:22.943
What are we gonna do to get out
of this debacle?

58:22.945 --> 58:24.179
I don't know.

58:25.414 --> 58:27.080
We'll figure it out when we get
there.

58:27.082 --> 58:29.049
Just stay present, Jackie.

58:29.051 --> 58:30.183
Figure out what?

58:30.185 --> 58:31.852
We got nothing, Mick.

58:31.854 --> 58:34.089
I mean we're freaking bums.

58:35.157 --> 58:38.392
At least we won't be two bums
in a box.

58:38.394 --> 58:40.360
That's what I love about you.

58:40.362 --> 58:42.531
You're always an optimist.

58:46.802 --> 58:49.471
Maybe we could open another bar.

58:51.106 --> 58:53.206
Are you kidding me?

58:53.208 --> 58:54.975
No, I'm serious.

58:54.977 --> 58:57.010
Are you forgetting that we had
a bar?

58:57.012 --> 58:58.912
Our family bar, you fucking
lost it?

58:58.914 --> 59:00.614
I mean I wouldn't open a
frickin' door

59:00.616 --> 59:02.282
with you, let alone another
frickin' bar.

59:02.284 --> 59:03.850
All right, quit while you're
ahead, Mick.

59:03.852 --> 59:04.851
You know what, Jackie?

59:04.853 --> 59:06.320
I can't quit while I'm ahead.

59:06.322 --> 59:08.855
I'm stuck in this position
because my whole life

59:08.857 --> 59:10.891
you are yanking me down, I
can't get ahead!

59:10.893 --> 59:13.393
You're like two cement blocks
on my fucking ankles!

59:13.395 --> 59:14.995
Would you cut the shit, Mick?

59:14.997 --> 59:16.530
You're being a real fucking
asshole, okay?

59:16.532 --> 59:18.865
I'm getting tired of the mental
anguish you're causing me.

59:18.867 --> 59:20.901
Like shooting fish in a barrel,
these two.

59:20.903 --> 59:22.069
You wanna do this right now?

59:22.071 --> 59:23.670
Yeah, maybe I do wanna do it
right now.

59:23.672 --> 59:25.172
Do it now, do it right now!

59:25.174 --> 59:26.909
I'll do it right now!

59:28.010 --> 59:29.142
Just do it!

59:29.144 --> 59:30.077
I hate you!

59:30.079 --> 59:31.311
I fucking hate you!

59:31.313 --> 59:32.446
I hate you!

59:32.448 --> 59:34.181
I will kill you myself and I'll
save Tony the hassle.

59:34.183 --> 59:35.449
Oh yeah right.

59:35.451 --> 59:37.050
Jackie!

59:37.052 --> 59:37.884
Jackie!

59:37.886 --> 59:38.820
Shh shh!

59:38.822 --> 59:39.653
What?

59:39.655 --> 59:40.487
What's that?

59:40.489 --> 59:43.158
I'm not fucking fall for that.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.200
We're fucked!

59:53.202 --> 59:54.034
What?

59:54.036 --> 59:55.102
What the fuck you talking about?

59:55.104 --> 59:56.303
That spineless motherfucker's
working for Tony.

59:56.305 --> 59:57.337
He's got Pete and Paulie with
him.

59:57.339 --> 59:58.171
Are you fucking with me?

59:58.173 --> 59:59.005
No.

59:59.007 --> 59:59.841
Are you fucking with me?

59:59.843 --> 1:00:00.674
No.

1:00:00.676 --> 1:00:01.742
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1:00:01.744 --> 1:00:02.578
Shit.

1:00:05.647 --> 1:00:06.480
Fuck!

1:00:06.482 --> 1:00:08.048
What?

1:00:08.050 --> 1:00:08.884
Go.

1:00:29.905 --> 1:00:31.138
Mickey!

1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:32.305
Jackie!

1:00:32.307 --> 1:00:33.375
Where you at?

1:00:42.618 --> 1:00:43.452
Come on!

1:00:44.319 --> 1:00:46.422
Let's get this over with!

1:00:49.958 --> 1:00:50.794
Numbnuts!

1:00:54.396 --> 1:00:55.397
It's Stevie!

1:01:01.970 --> 1:01:03.972
What's with the silence?

1:01:05.073 --> 1:01:07.176
I know you know I'm here.

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:12.314
Okay.

1:01:13.148 --> 1:01:16.116
I guess you don't want
the good news.

1:01:16.118 --> 1:01:17.553
I talked to Tony.

1:01:19.421 --> 1:01:21.655
He knows you didn't pull the
trigger.

1:01:21.657 --> 1:01:22.491
Come on.

1:01:25.594 --> 1:01:27.763
You guys are in the clear.

1:01:32.634 --> 1:01:33.469
Come on.

1:01:39.776 --> 1:01:42.846
All you gotta do is give up the
girl.

1:01:43.947 --> 1:01:46.615
Don't make it worse on yourself.

1:01:47.749 --> 1:01:52.787
Make the right choice for once
in your fucking lives.

1:01:52.789 --> 1:01:55.055
What do you mean worse, Stevie?

1:01:55.057 --> 1:01:56.189
I thought you said
we're in the clear

1:01:56.191 --> 1:01:58.126
if we give up the girl.

1:02:00.362 --> 1:02:02.229
Where's Jackie?

1:02:02.231 --> 1:02:03.065
Who?

1:02:05.734 --> 1:02:08.201
Don't fuck with me, Mickey.

1:02:08.203 --> 1:02:09.269
I said where's Jackie?

1:02:09.271 --> 1:02:10.403
I'm right here, you
motherfucker.

1:02:12.107 --> 1:02:13.707
Backstabbing piece of shit.

1:02:13.709 --> 1:02:15.075
How could you do this to us?

1:02:15.077 --> 1:02:17.511
We've known you
since we were kids!

1:02:17.513 --> 1:02:18.779
I had no choice.

1:02:18.781 --> 1:02:19.881
I was in a bad way.

1:02:19.883 --> 1:02:21.648
You're gonna get us out of
here, you hear me?

1:02:21.650 --> 1:02:22.649
Or we're gonna paint these walls

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:23.918
with your wet fucking brains!

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:25.018
Easy, Mick.

1:02:25.020 --> 1:02:28.421
Everything we did for you, this
is how you repay us?

1:02:28.423 --> 1:02:29.589
I can still fix it with Tony.

1:02:29.591 --> 1:02:30.624
Too late for that.

1:02:30.626 --> 1:02:32.526
Hey hey hey hey!

1:02:32.528 --> 1:02:33.861
Stop!

1:02:37.232 --> 1:02:38.565
Walk, you piece of shit.

1:02:38.567 --> 1:02:40.835
You're never gonna make it out
of the city alive.

1:02:40.837 --> 1:02:42.636
Tony's got guys everywhere.

1:02:42.638 --> 1:02:45.305
Just so you know, we go down,
you go down first.

1:02:45.307 --> 1:02:46.141
Yo!

1:02:47.376 --> 1:02:49.010
Jackie Callahan!

1:02:49.012 --> 1:02:51.244
I've been looking
all over for you.

1:02:51.246 --> 1:02:53.513
I still owe you from that cheap
shot in the subway.

1:02:53.515 --> 1:02:54.447
Remember?

1:02:54.449 --> 1:02:56.516
I'm all right Pete, it was my
pleasure.

1:02:56.518 --> 1:02:57.717
Oh no no no no.

1:02:57.719 --> 1:03:00.287
The pleasure's gonna be all
mine, jackoff.

1:03:00.289 --> 1:03:01.121
Hey!

1:03:01.123 --> 1:03:02.055
Back up!

1:03:02.057 --> 1:03:03.557
Back up or I'll drop him where
he stands!

1:03:03.559 --> 1:03:04.691
Back up!

1:03:04.693 --> 1:03:08.361
I don't give two shits about
that rat fuck.

1:03:08.363 --> 1:03:11.197
We got a handful of degenerates
like him at our disposal.

1:03:11.199 --> 1:03:13.433
And these are the guys
you were protecting.

1:03:13.435 --> 1:03:15.970
I owe Tony a big nut.

1:03:15.972 --> 1:03:17.070
What was I supposed to do?

1:03:17.072 --> 1:03:18.672
He's gonna hurt my family.

1:03:18.674 --> 1:03:19.774
Oh so you throw us
down the river

1:03:19.776 --> 1:03:21.374
for these greasy wop fucks?

1:03:21.376 --> 1:03:23.410
Hey, I'd appreciate it if you
stop with the insults.

1:03:23.412 --> 1:03:25.178
A man can only take so much.

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:27.848
Screw yourself Paulie,
you fat fuck!

1:03:27.850 --> 1:03:29.716
I'm gonna take that and let
that slide 'cause your balls

1:03:29.718 --> 1:03:31.751
are where your belly is, you
fucking punk!

1:03:31.753 --> 1:03:32.686
Yeah, what's in your belly?

1:03:32.688 --> 1:03:33.520
Cannolis?

1:03:33.522 --> 1:03:34.354
Motherfucker!

1:03:34.356 --> 1:03:35.689
All right all right!

1:03:35.691 --> 1:03:37.624
Enough with the posturing!

1:03:37.626 --> 1:03:39.359
Let Stevie go.

1:03:39.361 --> 1:03:40.727
Or don't.

1:03:40.729 --> 1:03:42.095
All we care about is the girl.

1:03:42.097 --> 1:03:43.163
You understand?

1:03:43.165 --> 1:03:44.164
Never.

1:03:44.166 --> 1:03:47.034
We're walking out of here with
him right now.

1:03:47.036 --> 1:03:48.401
I can't allow that.

1:03:48.403 --> 1:03:50.838
We're not asking for permission.

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:52.205
I guess it's settled them.

1:04:06.121 --> 1:04:07.754
Go!

1:04:10.726 --> 1:04:11.558
Oh no no!

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:13.027
You ain't getting away!

1:04:13.029 --> 1:04:13.963
Go go go!

1:04:17.867 --> 1:04:19.299
Why would Stevie sell you guys
out like that?

1:04:19.301 --> 1:04:20.835
Because nobody really knows
anyone!

1:04:20.837 --> 1:04:22.268
Clover, get on the floor now!

1:04:22.270 --> 1:04:24.304
Everyone shut the hell up!

1:04:26.075 --> 1:04:26.909
Fuck!

1:04:33.315 --> 1:04:35.850
Luck of the Irish with these
two, huh?

1:04:38.253 --> 1:04:40.888
Jesus Christ, it's Tony.

1:04:40.890 --> 1:04:41.721
Fuck.

1:04:41.723 --> 1:04:42.555
Hey T.

1:04:42.557 --> 1:04:44.058
Tell me something I wanna hear.

1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:45.126
We caught a bad beat.

1:04:45.128 --> 1:04:46.027
They got away.

1:04:46.029 --> 1:04:46.994
Cocksuckers!

1:04:46.996 --> 1:04:48.194
The little girls have more balls

1:04:48.196 --> 1:04:49.496
than the both of you combined.

1:04:49.498 --> 1:04:50.363
Put Stevie on the phone.

1:04:50.365 --> 1:04:51.698
Listen, about Stevie.

1:04:51.700 --> 1:04:52.833
We had a little problem.

1:04:52.835 --> 1:04:53.968
Problem?

1:04:53.970 --> 1:04:55.535
Why does it always gotta be a
problem with you two?

1:04:55.537 --> 1:04:57.004
Hey what the fuck?

1:04:57.006 --> 1:04:57.838
Where the hell were you?

1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:58.941
Taking a nap?

1:05:01.710 --> 1:05:02.977
The fuck?

1:05:05.213 --> 1:05:06.546
What the fuck is going on?

1:05:06.548 --> 1:05:08.550
Where the fuck are they?

1:05:09.852 --> 1:05:10.684
I don't see them.

1:05:10.686 --> 1:05:11.685
I think we lost them.

1:05:11.687 --> 1:05:12.585
Backstabbing piece of shit!

1:05:12.587 --> 1:05:14.021
He was always a pussy!

1:05:14.023 --> 1:05:15.122
Jackie, where are we gonna go?

1:05:15.124 --> 1:05:15.956
I don't know!

1:05:15.958 --> 1:05:17.223
Stop screaming, I gotta
concentrate.

1:05:17.225 --> 1:05:18.059
Where are we gonna go?

1:05:18.061 --> 1:05:19.292
Oh my god!

1:05:19.294 --> 1:05:20.393
I think I know somebody.

1:05:20.395 --> 1:05:21.227
Hey guys...

1:05:21.229 --> 1:05:22.063
Clover, are you hard of hearing?

1:05:22.065 --> 1:05:23.097
I said stay down!

1:05:23.099 --> 1:05:25.432
Yeah, but there's something
wrong with Angie!

1:05:25.434 --> 1:05:26.433
What?

1:05:26.435 --> 1:05:27.269
What?

1:05:30.205 --> 1:05:31.038
Oh shit.

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:31.872
What?

1:05:31.874 --> 1:05:32.706
What, what is it?

1:05:32.708 --> 1:05:33.540
Jesus Christ!

1:05:33.542 --> 1:05:34.374
What is it?

1:05:34.376 --> 1:05:35.375
Just drive, don't look back.

1:05:35.377 --> 1:05:36.443
Oh my god, Angie.

1:05:36.445 --> 1:05:37.945
Is it what I think it is?

1:05:37.947 --> 1:05:40.781
It's not what I think it is,
huh?

1:05:40.783 --> 1:05:43.249
Mickey, is it what
I think it is?

1:06:21.891 --> 1:06:23.858
What are we gonna do with her?

1:06:23.860 --> 1:06:25.725
I don't know.

1:06:25.727 --> 1:06:30.465
Guess we leave her body in the
car 'til someone finds it.

1:06:31.968 --> 1:06:32.800
How you doing?

1:06:32.802 --> 1:06:33.635
You okay?

1:06:34.636 --> 1:06:35.870
Okay?

1:06:35.872 --> 1:06:37.104
No.

1:06:37.106 --> 1:06:39.874
I'm not okay, I mean she's...

1:06:39.876 --> 1:06:41.942
She's dead, Mick.

1:06:41.944 --> 1:06:43.610
And I did this.

1:06:43.612 --> 1:06:45.045
Okay, listen.

1:06:45.047 --> 1:06:46.180
Don't do that, okay?

1:06:46.182 --> 1:06:47.447
This is not your fault.

1:06:47.449 --> 1:06:49.582
She wouldn't have
been with us, Mick.

1:06:49.584 --> 1:06:50.985
And she wouldn't
be sitting in the car

1:06:50.987 --> 1:06:53.053
with her brains all over the
back seat.

1:06:53.055 --> 1:06:54.721
Jackie, come on.

1:06:54.723 --> 1:06:55.557
Hey.

1:06:56.859 --> 1:06:57.892
What do you want?

1:06:57.894 --> 1:06:59.193
Listen.

1:06:59.195 --> 1:07:01.862
Angie knew what she was getting
herself into.

1:07:01.864 --> 1:07:03.230
She was well aware of the risk

1:07:03.232 --> 1:07:05.498
and she still helped us out
anyway.

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:06.836
Angie was loyal.

1:07:08.104 --> 1:07:09.270
You finished?

1:07:09.272 --> 1:07:11.437
If it's any consolation, at
least you got

1:07:11.439 --> 1:07:14.175
to reconnect with her again,
you know?

1:07:14.177 --> 1:07:16.010
Relight the flame.

1:07:16.012 --> 1:07:18.014
You'll always have that.

1:07:19.148 --> 1:07:21.614
Yeah, no, that doesn't
make me feel better.

1:07:21.616 --> 1:07:22.450
Jackie.

1:07:25.087 --> 1:07:28.222
I thought that was sweet of you.

1:07:28.224 --> 1:07:30.825
We should torch the car with
Angie's body inside.

1:07:30.827 --> 1:07:33.595
We need to get
rid of the prints.

1:07:34.831 --> 1:07:39.501
You have an interesting way
with words, you know that?

1:07:44.573 --> 1:07:46.673
This is the place
you're taking us?

1:07:46.675 --> 1:07:48.275
You got any better ideas?

1:07:48.277 --> 1:07:49.109
No?

1:07:49.111 --> 1:07:51.178
All right, then shut the fuck
up.

1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:52.947
Do you guys ever agree on
anything?

1:07:52.949 --> 1:07:54.683
- Never.
- Sometimes.

1:08:02.058 --> 1:08:03.157
Jackie.

1:08:03.159 --> 1:08:03.993
Mickey.

1:08:04.994 --> 1:08:06.093
Mickey!

1:08:06.095 --> 1:08:07.061
Jackie.

1:08:07.063 --> 1:08:08.595
What a surprise.

1:08:08.597 --> 1:08:12.066
I am so thrilled
to see you guys.

1:08:12.068 --> 1:08:14.902
It has to be 10, 12 years.

1:08:14.904 --> 1:08:15.970
It's actually been three years,

1:08:15.972 --> 1:08:17.805
but who's counting right?

1:08:17.807 --> 1:08:19.807
How's Aunt Rose, your mother?

1:08:19.809 --> 1:08:20.640
She's good.

1:08:20.642 --> 1:08:22.009
She died five years ago.

1:08:22.011 --> 1:08:23.010
That's great.

1:08:23.012 --> 1:08:25.378
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:27.647
You were actually at the
funeral.

1:08:27.649 --> 1:08:29.116
Oh my.

1:08:29.118 --> 1:08:32.385
Time goes by so fast doesn't it?

1:08:32.387 --> 1:08:35.022
And your father, how's he
holding up?

1:08:35.024 --> 1:08:36.323
Pop's dead too.

1:08:36.325 --> 1:08:38.993
But you know,
he's hanging in there.

1:08:38.995 --> 1:08:40.327
God, that's awful.

1:08:40.329 --> 1:08:42.129
Was it recent?

1:08:42.131 --> 1:08:42.963
Yeah, no.

1:08:42.965 --> 1:08:43.797
It wasn't recent at all.

1:08:43.799 --> 1:08:45.065
He died three years ago.

1:08:45.067 --> 1:08:46.867
Oddly enough, you were at that
funeral too.

1:08:46.869 --> 1:08:49.370
But hey, who's keeping track,
right Terry?

1:08:49.372 --> 1:08:50.204
I know!

1:08:51.140 --> 1:08:52.540
Such a huge loss.

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:56.476
So they let you leave the
hospital?

1:08:56.478 --> 1:08:57.912
Yeah, they didn't.

1:08:59.315 --> 1:09:01.148
I'm sorry, what?

1:09:01.150 --> 1:09:02.415
What?

1:09:02.417 --> 1:09:04.717
No, they didn't leave me, I
didn't leave,

1:09:04.719 --> 1:09:07.656
oh no, I didn't leave, they
didn't.

1:09:08.891 --> 1:09:10.090
Where's my manners?

1:09:10.092 --> 1:09:12.659
I'm yapping your ears off in
the doorway.

1:09:12.661 --> 1:09:16.196
Who is this lovely little lady
you have with you?

1:09:16.198 --> 1:09:17.398
I'm Clover.

1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:19.300
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1:09:19.302 --> 1:09:23.170
It's a pleasure to
meet you also.

1:09:23.172 --> 1:09:25.139
Clover, do you like spaghetti?

1:09:25.141 --> 1:09:26.006
I love it.

1:09:26.008 --> 1:09:26.941
Great.

1:09:26.943 --> 1:09:29.575
Come with me, I'm just about to
make some.

1:09:29.577 --> 1:09:30.645
I won't bite.

1:09:33.082 --> 1:09:34.317
Seems better.

1:09:42.091 --> 1:09:45.426
So how long's it's been since
you taught at MIT, Terry?

1:09:45.428 --> 1:09:47.627
I never taught at MIT.

1:09:47.629 --> 1:09:49.129
Well not the real me.

1:09:49.131 --> 1:09:51.165
That was just the manufactured
robot

1:09:51.167 --> 1:09:53.733
the government had in my place.

1:09:53.735 --> 1:09:54.802
Oh.

1:09:54.804 --> 1:09:57.037
So it's safe to say you're off
your meds.

1:09:57.039 --> 1:09:58.771
If you're talking about the
tracking device

1:09:58.773 --> 1:10:02.642
they had implanted into my
cells, then yes.

1:10:02.644 --> 1:10:05.747
I am no longer a
slave to the regime.

1:10:07.950 --> 1:10:10.417
Did they really implant
something into your cells?

1:10:10.419 --> 1:10:11.584
- No.
- Definitely not.

1:10:11.586 --> 1:10:12.820
They did.

1:10:12.822 --> 1:10:14.421
And how'd you get it out?

1:10:14.423 --> 1:10:16.656
First I stopped taking that
poison.

1:10:16.658 --> 1:10:18.125
I weened myself off.

1:10:18.127 --> 1:10:20.894
Then I fasted for about a month

1:10:20.896 --> 1:10:23.663
to purge the rest of it.

1:10:23.665 --> 1:10:26.235
And lastly, I concocted a serum

1:10:27.602 --> 1:10:30.037
that I ingested to make
absolutely sure

1:10:30.039 --> 1:10:32.306
there wasn't a trace of residue
left over.

1:10:32.308 --> 1:10:34.408
And what did that do?

1:10:34.410 --> 1:10:36.076
I flatlined naturally.

1:10:36.078 --> 1:10:39.645
Do you know I was clinically
dead for two minutes?

1:10:39.647 --> 1:10:40.546
No way!

1:10:40.548 --> 1:10:41.415
Yes way.

1:10:41.417 --> 1:10:42.249
Really?

1:10:42.251 --> 1:10:43.549
Is that even possible?

1:10:43.551 --> 1:10:44.785
I could show you.

1:10:44.787 --> 1:10:46.120
I recorded the procedure.

1:10:46.122 --> 1:10:48.521
I think we're good, Terry.

1:10:48.523 --> 1:10:49.423
Are you sure?

1:10:49.425 --> 1:10:52.226
I have so many spectacular
recordings.

1:10:52.228 --> 1:10:53.861
There's one about the government

1:10:53.863 --> 1:10:55.728
polluting our water sources.

1:10:55.730 --> 1:10:57.364
It's their way of keeping the
masses

1:10:57.366 --> 1:10:59.766
sick and controlling the
population.

1:10:59.768 --> 1:11:02.036
You should really watch it, it
will blow your mind.

1:11:02.038 --> 1:11:03.270
Okay, Terry.

1:11:03.272 --> 1:11:04.204
We need to talk to you about

1:11:04.206 --> 1:11:05.439
something important all right?

1:11:05.441 --> 1:11:06.940
Well I don't think it's as
important as

1:11:06.942 --> 1:11:09.143
the government controlling our
whole existence,

1:11:09.145 --> 1:11:10.576
but if you feel the need to
share

1:11:10.578 --> 1:11:11.979
something less significant.

1:11:11.981 --> 1:11:13.447
Okay, Terry.

1:11:13.449 --> 1:11:14.580
We are in trouble.

1:11:14.582 --> 1:11:16.584
Our lives are in danger.

1:11:17.453 --> 1:11:18.786
Danger like how?

1:11:18.788 --> 1:11:20.788
In an abiotic way?

1:11:20.790 --> 1:11:22.122
The what way?

1:11:22.124 --> 1:11:23.357
Abiotic.

1:11:23.359 --> 1:11:27.127
Characterized by the absence of
life of living organisms.

1:11:27.129 --> 1:11:28.195
In English, Terry.

1:11:28.197 --> 1:11:30.364
The non-living.

1:11:30.366 --> 1:11:31.865
Or dead.

1:11:31.867 --> 1:11:33.500
What other types would there be?

1:11:33.502 --> 1:11:35.701
Oh there are a plethora of
different types

1:11:35.703 --> 1:11:38.038
and categories and
subcategories...

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:39.139
Christ's sake, Terry.

1:11:39.141 --> 1:11:41.542
Someone wants us dead, all
right?

1:11:41.544 --> 1:11:44.577
Like the real dead so we
flatline for good.

1:11:44.579 --> 1:11:48.949
Not some experiment in front of
a video camera.

1:11:48.951 --> 1:11:52.955
It is quite fascinating, this
high level risk.

1:11:54.323 --> 1:11:55.688
Mmmm, extremely captivating.

1:11:55.690 --> 1:11:56.523
Okay, Terry!

1:11:56.525 --> 1:11:57.391
Yeah?

1:11:57.393 --> 1:11:59.927
We need your help to kill Tony
Divalo.

1:11:59.929 --> 1:12:01.061
Then why didn't you just say
that

1:12:01.063 --> 1:12:03.332
in the first place, Jackie?

1:12:04.732 --> 1:12:05.835
I'm Jackie.

1:13:34.156 --> 1:13:38.227
Now these particular ones here
are my children.

1:13:39.727 --> 1:13:41.495
Why do you call them that?

1:13:41.497 --> 1:13:43.931
Because they are loyal.

1:13:43.933 --> 1:13:46.766
And they love me
unconditionally.

1:13:46.768 --> 1:13:48.734
And they never let me down.

1:13:48.736 --> 1:13:50.237
How so?

1:13:50.239 --> 1:13:54.474
Well their effects are clean,
but extremely lethal

1:13:54.476 --> 1:13:59.313
and almost entirely undetectable
if administered correctly.

1:13:59.315 --> 1:14:00.280
What does she do?

1:14:00.282 --> 1:14:01.183
Easy now.

1:14:03.852 --> 1:14:06.453
We don't want to upset her.

1:14:06.455 --> 1:14:08.522
Jessica's my oldest.

1:14:08.524 --> 1:14:09.990
And very consistent.

1:14:09.992 --> 1:14:12.326
In powder form, when sprinkled
on any ingestant

1:14:12.328 --> 1:14:14.361
or when added to any liquid,
she will put

1:14:14.363 --> 1:14:17.965
all living creatures down for
the big sleep.

1:14:17.967 --> 1:14:19.800
How long for it to take effect?

1:14:19.802 --> 1:14:22.135
In most cases instantaneous.

1:14:22.137 --> 1:14:23.769
What about Marvin?

1:14:23.771 --> 1:14:26.206
Same effect, but he's airborne.

1:14:26.208 --> 1:14:28.475
And for the most
part my most reliable.

1:14:28.477 --> 1:14:31.945
When Marvin
gets into your lungs,

1:14:31.947 --> 1:14:34.314
it's bye bye birdie, fat lady
has sung.

1:14:35.750 --> 1:14:36.850
And him?

1:14:36.852 --> 1:14:38.285
Why do you call him Andre?

1:14:38.287 --> 1:14:40.222
Because he's a giant.

1:14:41.123 --> 1:14:42.489
I don't understand.

1:14:43.826 --> 1:14:46.360
You just add a few drops of
Andre to any water source

1:14:46.362 --> 1:14:49.830
and you could wipe out an
entire village.

1:14:49.832 --> 1:14:51.865
What the hell are you...

1:14:51.867 --> 1:14:53.033
What is wrong with you?

1:14:53.035 --> 1:14:55.768
What kind of sick and twisted
person are you, Terry?

1:14:55.770 --> 1:14:57.237
The hostility.

1:14:57.239 --> 1:14:59.072
I don't understand where it's
coming from.

1:14:59.074 --> 1:15:00.407
You don't understand?

1:15:00.409 --> 1:15:02.643
Who tells a 13 year old girl
about shit like that?

1:15:02.645 --> 1:15:03.844
It's deranged.

1:15:03.846 --> 1:15:06.313
Relax Mickey, it's educational.

1:15:06.315 --> 1:15:08.649
The child was intrigued and
wanted to know.

1:15:08.651 --> 1:15:10.050
I don't see the issue.

1:15:10.052 --> 1:15:12.586
Yeah, you don't see the issue
'cause you're a lunatic.

1:15:12.588 --> 1:15:15.589
Make that call before the smack
the insanity off of you!

1:15:15.591 --> 1:15:17.324
I don't appreciate being
compared

1:15:17.326 --> 1:15:20.260
to an individual who's
mentally incompetent.

1:15:20.262 --> 1:15:21.561
You should watch what you say

1:15:21.563 --> 1:15:24.931
to people, Mr. Jackie Callahan!

1:15:24.933 --> 1:15:26.900
Some people have
an adverse reaction

1:15:26.902 --> 1:15:29.405
when addressed in that manner.

1:15:31.206 --> 1:15:32.975
Just make the call.

1:15:34.376 --> 1:15:35.711
Wash your hands.

1:15:36.745 --> 1:15:38.345
What I miss?

1:15:38.347 --> 1:15:39.179
Just get up.

1:15:39.181 --> 1:15:40.013
It's almost time, all right?

1:15:40.015 --> 1:15:40.849
Get up.

1:15:42.951 --> 1:15:44.985
Make me some coffee.

1:15:49.758 --> 1:15:51.925
Come to my house
and eat my food.

1:15:51.927 --> 1:15:54.261
I'll tie you into a pretzel.

1:15:54.263 --> 1:15:56.165
No respect, these kids.

1:16:06.542 --> 1:16:07.407
Yeah.

1:16:07.409 --> 1:16:09.509
I need to speak to a Mr.
Anthony Divalo

1:16:09.511 --> 1:16:13.280
regarding the whereabouts of
Mickey and Jackie Callahan.

1:16:13.282 --> 1:16:14.981
And a certain little lady.

1:16:14.983 --> 1:16:18.151
Now before we go into it, is
there

1:16:18.153 --> 1:16:21.088
any compensation for this
information?

1:16:21.090 --> 1:16:22.889
Course there's a reward.

1:16:22.891 --> 1:16:24.925
A big fat pile of dough.

1:16:24.927 --> 1:16:25.761
30 large.

1:16:26.628 --> 1:16:29.529
Yeah, well your loyalty is duly
noted.

1:16:29.531 --> 1:16:30.664
My pleasure.

1:16:30.666 --> 1:16:31.498
Yeah.

1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:33.934
Thank you.

1:16:33.936 --> 1:16:35.604
So, no loose ends?

1:16:36.672 --> 1:16:38.774
Like it never happened.

1:16:43.078 --> 1:16:44.179
Motherfucker!

1:16:52.054 --> 1:16:53.720
Hey Terry, what is
the plan here?

1:16:53.722 --> 1:16:55.522
How is this going down?

1:16:55.524 --> 1:16:58.625
The details are in the
preparatory measures.

1:16:58.627 --> 1:17:00.961
My advice to you is to pay
close attention

1:17:00.963 --> 1:17:03.363
and follow my instructions.

1:17:03.365 --> 1:17:05.165
What's with the fire
extinguishers?

1:17:05.167 --> 1:17:06.133
Yeah.

1:17:06.135 --> 1:17:07.367
The less you ask, the better
your intentions

1:17:07.369 --> 1:17:09.469
are of getting out of this
alive.

1:17:09.471 --> 1:17:11.204
Right Terry?

1:17:12.674 --> 1:17:15.812
A good student is a mindful
student.

1:17:17.513 --> 1:17:18.645
Yeah, good talk, Terry.

1:17:18.647 --> 1:17:21.248
You're really putting
my mind at ease.

1:17:42.671 --> 1:17:44.771
Come on come on come on,
hurry the fuck up.

1:17:44.773 --> 1:17:46.072
I don't have all fucking day
here.

1:17:46.074 --> 1:17:46.910
Let's go.

1:17:48.944 --> 1:17:51.947
Gus, clean the
rest of that shit up.

1:18:50.672 --> 1:18:52.107
Here they come.

1:19:10.092 --> 1:19:12.492
I see you got them all here,
that's good.

1:19:12.494 --> 1:19:15.629
The old man will be
very happy about that.

1:19:15.631 --> 1:19:17.999
Do you have the monetary reward

1:19:18.001 --> 1:19:20.235
Mr. Divalo and I discussed?

1:19:21.603 --> 1:19:23.838
Right to it, I like that.

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:27.342
I mean why waste time
with the small talk?

1:19:30.847 --> 1:19:31.680
Good?

1:19:32.581 --> 1:19:33.582
Fantastic.

1:19:34.918 --> 1:19:35.751
Great.

1:19:46.261 --> 1:19:48.998
There's a little change of
plans.

1:19:50.098 --> 1:19:51.266
No loose ends.

1:19:53.435 --> 1:19:54.734
Or loose nuts?

1:19:54.736 --> 1:19:55.571
Huh?

1:19:56.505 --> 1:19:57.704
Loose nuts?

1:19:59.174 --> 1:20:00.407
What the fuck is that?

1:20:00.409 --> 1:20:01.243
Oh this?

1:20:02.444 --> 1:20:03.679
This is Marvin.

1:20:45.054 --> 1:20:46.821
Jesus Christ!

1:20:46.823 --> 1:20:48.521
Jesus Christ!

1:20:48.523 --> 1:20:50.057
Jesus Christ!

1:20:55.263 --> 1:20:56.630
I'll kill you!

1:20:56.632 --> 1:20:58.467
I'll fucking kill you!

1:21:00.268 --> 1:21:02.369
Can't fucking breathe!

1:21:02.371 --> 1:21:03.538
Can't breathe!

1:21:20.923 --> 1:21:23.024
Say goodnight, you bitch.

1:21:37.305 --> 1:21:40.674
Whoa, you are a wild man, Terry!

1:21:40.676 --> 1:21:43.044
I cannot believe you pulled
that shit off.

1:21:43.046 --> 1:21:44.779
You see the look on their faces?

1:21:44.781 --> 1:21:47.948
We really should be begin
preparation for Tony

1:21:47.950 --> 1:21:50.918
now that his men are
incapacitated.

1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:55.156
How long is that gas gonna keep
his guys out for?

1:21:55.158 --> 1:21:57.858
Fairly good amount of time.

1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:00.326
What kind of gas did you use,
Terry?

1:22:00.328 --> 1:22:04.965
More or less the kind you don't
wake up from.

1:22:04.967 --> 1:22:06.035
Wait, what?

1:22:07.302 --> 1:22:08.334
Yeah.

1:22:08.336 --> 1:22:09.502
More or less?

1:22:09.504 --> 1:22:10.336
More or less?

1:22:10.338 --> 1:22:11.172
Yeah.

1:22:11.174 --> 1:22:12.840
Are you kidding me?

1:22:12.842 --> 1:22:14.574
If I remember correctly, you
did say

1:22:14.576 --> 1:22:17.210
you wanted to kill Tony Divalo.

1:22:17.212 --> 1:22:19.546
I said Tony Divalo, I didn't
say I wanted to be

1:22:19.548 --> 1:22:22.582
an accomplice to a mass murder,
you frickin' nutjob.

1:22:22.584 --> 1:22:24.051
All right.

1:22:24.053 --> 1:22:24.885
Whoa!

1:22:24.887 --> 1:22:25.685
Whoa!

1:22:25.687 --> 1:22:26.519
Terry!

1:22:26.521 --> 1:22:27.353
Oh no no!

1:22:27.355 --> 1:22:29.357
I think I told you once!

1:22:30.492 --> 1:22:33.593
I do not appreciate that kind
of verbal abuse!

1:22:33.595 --> 1:22:34.627
Terry, put the gun down.

1:22:34.629 --> 1:22:35.562
No no no!

1:22:35.564 --> 1:22:36.897
No, no!

1:22:36.899 --> 1:22:39.834
I think I warned you not to
vocalize

1:22:39.836 --> 1:22:42.069
those types of poisonous
notions.

1:22:42.071 --> 1:22:42.903
Terry.

1:22:42.905 --> 1:22:44.038
Terry, put the gun down!

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:44.905
We're family.

1:22:44.907 --> 1:22:46.807
Mickey didn't mean
anything by it.

1:22:46.809 --> 1:22:48.843
He was just playing around.

1:22:48.845 --> 1:22:49.977
Right Mick?

1:22:49.979 --> 1:22:50.978
That is right.

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:52.179
I lost my cool, Terry.

1:22:52.181 --> 1:22:53.747
Let's put the gun down, okay?

1:22:53.749 --> 1:22:54.750
Put it down.

1:22:57.186 --> 1:22:58.152
See?

1:22:58.154 --> 1:22:59.120
He's sorry.

1:22:59.122 --> 1:22:59.956
Ah!

1:23:01.057 --> 1:23:02.724
Everything's okay.

1:23:06.796 --> 1:23:09.264
Okay, I accept your apology.

1:23:11.566 --> 1:23:12.634
Who's hungry?

1:23:13.635 --> 1:23:14.802
I'm pretty hungry.

1:23:14.804 --> 1:23:16.371
- Whoa, whoa!
- Hey!

1:23:17.272 --> 1:23:18.806
No, no, no!

1:23:18.808 --> 1:23:19.639
Hold on!

1:23:19.641 --> 1:23:20.573
Hold on!

1:23:20.575 --> 1:23:21.541
Tony don't even know
what she looks like!

1:23:21.543 --> 1:23:22.542
He won't even know if she's
alive or dead!

1:23:22.544 --> 1:23:23.878
Yeah, it's us you want,
all right?

1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:25.112
We killed Joey Divalo, not her.

1:23:25.114 --> 1:23:26.147
Just let her go.

1:23:26.149 --> 1:23:27.114
Take us.

1:23:27.116 --> 1:23:28.548
The girl don't know nothing.

1:23:28.550 --> 1:23:30.283
I knew this day would come.

1:23:30.285 --> 1:23:31.451
She don't know nothing okay?

1:23:31.453 --> 1:23:32.485
Take us, not the girl.

1:23:32.487 --> 1:23:34.255
Please, she doesn't know
anything.

1:23:34.257 --> 1:23:35.522
She don't know nothing.

1:23:35.524 --> 1:23:36.791
No, over here, us.

1:23:36.793 --> 1:23:38.159
Us.

1:23:38.161 --> 1:23:39.526
No, easy.

1:23:39.528 --> 1:23:42.062
It's us you want, okay?

1:23:43.532 --> 1:23:44.597
Terry no, Terry!

1:23:44.599 --> 1:23:45.431
Moms!

1:23:45.433 --> 1:23:46.269
No!

1:23:47.335 --> 1:23:49.302
No no no no, not Terry!

1:23:49.304 --> 1:23:51.238
Moms, why would you kill him?

1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:53.439
What do you keep
saying moms for?

1:23:53.441 --> 1:23:54.241
Moms, don't!

1:23:54.243 --> 1:23:55.109
Please stop!

1:23:55.111 --> 1:23:56.078
Please stop!

1:23:58.346 --> 1:23:59.412
Sweetheart.

1:23:59.414 --> 1:24:00.247
Come on.

1:24:00.249 --> 1:24:01.314
What the fuck?

1:24:01.316 --> 1:24:02.448
You need to move away from them.

1:24:02.450 --> 1:24:03.284
Now.

1:24:03.286 --> 1:24:04.251
No no, they're my friends!

1:24:04.253 --> 1:24:05.652
No, they are not your friends.

1:24:05.654 --> 1:24:06.821
Take it easy!

1:24:06.823 --> 1:24:08.421
Come on.

1:24:08.423 --> 1:24:10.557
Okay now, take out your gun.

1:24:10.559 --> 1:24:11.859
- Gun?
- Gun?

1:24:11.861 --> 1:24:13.526
You had a gun this whole time?

1:24:13.528 --> 1:24:14.995
You think we'd leave her
unarmed?

1:24:14.997 --> 1:24:17.564
What kind of mothers do you
think we are?

1:24:17.566 --> 1:24:18.999
Mothers?

1:24:19.001 --> 1:24:21.634
Clover, what the hell is going
on?

1:24:21.636 --> 1:24:23.270
I'm sorry.

1:24:23.272 --> 1:24:24.104
You're sorry?

1:24:24.106 --> 1:24:24.939
Was this a lie?

1:24:24.941 --> 1:24:25.973
Everything was a lie?

1:24:25.975 --> 1:24:27.074
Stop talking to her.

1:24:27.076 --> 1:24:29.243
Baby, hey, look at me, okay?

1:24:29.245 --> 1:24:31.278
Now remember what we taught you.

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:32.612
Rule number one.

1:24:32.614 --> 1:24:34.647
No emotional attachments.

1:24:34.649 --> 1:24:35.481
Okay?

1:24:35.483 --> 1:24:37.218
They are nothing to you.

1:24:37.220 --> 1:24:38.351
They're just marks.

1:24:38.353 --> 1:24:40.522
They're a means to an end.

1:24:44.861 --> 1:24:47.263
Your target is Joey Divalo.

1:24:51.968 --> 1:24:54.701
And what about the brothers?

1:24:54.703 --> 1:24:56.502
They're collateral damage.

1:24:56.504 --> 1:24:58.272
We'll take them
out if we have to.

1:24:58.274 --> 1:24:59.739
But I hear Tony's already got
two holes

1:24:59.741 --> 1:25:04.013
dug for them, so it's totally
up to you, okay baby?

1:25:05.714 --> 1:25:10.851
Tuck the gun in the back of
your pants like we showed you.

1:25:10.853 --> 1:25:13.120
Do you have your phone?

1:25:13.122 --> 1:25:14.788
Yeah.

1:25:14.790 --> 1:25:15.890
Good.

1:25:15.892 --> 1:25:17.825
If we get split up, we'll have
you tracked

1:25:17.827 --> 1:25:21.195
and know your whereabouts at
all times.

1:25:21.197 --> 1:25:22.029
Okay.

1:25:22.031 --> 1:25:23.163
I don't give a fuck about

1:25:23.165 --> 1:25:24.832
your fucking neighbors,
you motherfucker!

1:25:24.834 --> 1:25:26.800
You owe me fucking money,
you cunt!

1:25:26.802 --> 1:25:29.669
You understand why we're doing
this, right baby?

1:25:29.671 --> 1:25:32.174
What all this training is for?

1:25:33.209 --> 1:25:34.607
Because you never want something

1:25:34.609 --> 1:25:37.744
to happen to me like what
happened in Iraq.

1:25:37.746 --> 1:25:39.545
That's right.

1:25:39.547 --> 1:25:41.782
No man will ever get the
satisfaction

1:25:41.784 --> 1:25:45.121
of taking anything from our
little girl.

1:25:46.521 --> 1:25:50.592
But something very very special
did come from it.

1:25:52.795 --> 1:25:55.865
And that's you, my love.

1:25:57.599 --> 1:26:00.100
God works in mysterious ways.

1:26:00.102 --> 1:26:01.534
There is no other fucking way.

1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:05.471
We love you, baby.

1:26:05.473 --> 1:26:07.410
So, so much.

1:26:08.443 --> 1:26:11.047
I love you guys too.

1:26:17.286 --> 1:26:18.453
No!

1:26:20.156 --> 1:26:21.822
Are you nervous?

1:26:21.824 --> 1:26:24.124
A little.

1:26:24.126 --> 1:26:25.525
Having nerves is natural.

1:26:25.527 --> 1:26:27.529
Keeps the blood pumping.

1:26:28.563 --> 1:26:31.631
And it'll help you stay focused.

1:26:35.371 --> 1:26:37.037
But we'll be right here with you

1:26:37.039 --> 1:26:38.705
every step of the way, so don't
worry.

1:26:38.707 --> 1:26:41.474
We would never let anything
happen to you.

1:26:41.476 --> 1:26:42.343
Ever.

1:26:42.345 --> 1:26:43.846
I know.

1:26:45.547 --> 1:26:46.679
Okay.

1:26:46.681 --> 1:26:47.515
You ready?

1:26:48.683 --> 1:26:50.086
Ready.

1:26:52.587 --> 1:26:55.024
That's our girl.

1:27:01.197 --> 1:27:03.097
You were gonna kill us all
along weren't you?

1:27:03.099 --> 1:27:05.132
You used us as bait?

1:27:05.134 --> 1:27:08.202
Follow the cheese and you'll
get the rats.

1:27:08.204 --> 1:27:09.036
What?

1:27:09.038 --> 1:27:10.237
What?

1:27:10.239 --> 1:27:11.771
Please don't make this harder
for me than it already is.

1:27:11.773 --> 1:27:12.973
Harder for you?

1:27:12.975 --> 1:27:16.743
You do realize you got a gun
pointed at our heads right?

1:27:16.745 --> 1:27:18.711
Clover, what are you doing?

1:27:18.713 --> 1:27:19.913
Just close your eyes, okay?

1:27:19.915 --> 1:27:22.615
I promise you guys won't feel a
thing.

1:27:22.617 --> 1:27:26.120
Well you two take the cake in
parenting.

1:27:26.122 --> 1:27:27.421
Congratulations, you
successfully

1:27:27.423 --> 1:27:29.555
raised a fucking psychopath.

1:27:29.557 --> 1:27:31.691
I'm just itching to kill this
one.

1:27:31.693 --> 1:27:33.360
Get down on your knees,
both of you.

1:27:33.362 --> 1:27:34.660
Enough of the small talk.

1:27:34.662 --> 1:27:35.496
Screw you!

1:27:35.498 --> 1:27:37.498
Yeah, we'll take it standing.

1:27:42.938 --> 1:27:44.004
No, moms!

1:27:44.006 --> 1:27:45.007
Please stop!

1:27:46.308 --> 1:27:48.242
Then you need to finish it.

1:27:48.244 --> 1:27:50.477
Sweetie, your feelings are
confusing you.

1:27:50.479 --> 1:27:51.881
That's all it is.

1:27:53.648 --> 1:27:54.483
It's time.

1:27:55.451 --> 1:27:56.582
Don't listen to them, Clover.

1:27:56.584 --> 1:27:58.252
You don't have to do this.

1:27:58.254 --> 1:27:59.987
I don't have a choice.

1:27:59.989 --> 1:28:01.490
Actually you do.

1:28:03.959 --> 1:28:06.128
I'm glad I met you both.

1:28:08.397 --> 1:28:10.630
Even you, Jackie.

1:28:13.102 --> 1:28:16.904
And I meant what I said, you
guys really are my friends.

1:28:16.906 --> 1:28:18.405
Yeah, well where I
come from you don't

1:28:18.407 --> 1:28:19.840
shoot your friends Clover, okay?

1:28:19.842 --> 1:28:20.874
Rule number one.

1:28:20.876 --> 1:28:23.310
You don't kill your friends.

1:28:23.312 --> 1:28:24.146
Ow!

1:28:25.281 --> 1:28:29.049
After all we did for you, this
is what you do?

1:28:29.051 --> 1:28:30.784
This is how you treat us?

1:28:30.786 --> 1:28:31.919
Huh?

1:28:31.921 --> 1:28:33.719
Is your name even Clover?

1:28:33.721 --> 1:28:34.557
Yeah.

1:28:37.226 --> 1:28:40.229
I was really starting
to like you.

1:28:41.130 --> 1:28:42.896
Fuck, this really hurts.

1:28:42.898 --> 1:28:43.833
No, moms.

1:28:45.401 --> 1:28:46.469
You're wrong.

1:28:47.669 --> 1:28:50.070
Not everyone's a mark.

1:28:50.072 --> 1:28:53.509
Sometimes you need
emotional attachments.

1:28:54.910 --> 1:28:56.243
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:28:56.245 --> 1:28:57.643
I'm not gonna hurt
Mickey and Jackie.

1:28:57.645 --> 1:29:00.781
I don't care about your rules,
I won't do it.

1:29:00.783 --> 1:29:03.851
You don't kill your friends.

1:29:03.853 --> 1:29:06.153
That is so sweet, my love.

1:29:06.155 --> 1:29:07.521
And I get it.

1:29:07.523 --> 1:29:10.756
I understand, this is a hard
lesson to learn, okay?

1:29:10.758 --> 1:29:12.593
We do need to end this now.

1:29:12.595 --> 1:29:13.527
Yeah.

1:29:13.529 --> 1:29:15.596
No no, we don't
have to kill them!

1:29:15.598 --> 1:29:16.430
She's right.

1:29:16.432 --> 1:29:17.564
We could just crawl out of here.

1:29:17.566 --> 1:29:19.933
Nobody would ever know.

1:29:19.935 --> 1:29:23.437
Unlike you two, we have a
reputation to uphold.

1:29:23.439 --> 1:29:24.340
Fuck you.

1:29:25.673 --> 1:29:27.141
Uphold this, you wackos.

1:29:27.143 --> 1:29:31.078
You gonna do it, just go ahead
and do it!

1:29:32.114 --> 1:29:32.946
Moms!

1:29:32.948 --> 1:29:33.782
No!

1:29:36.552 --> 1:29:37.386
No!

1:29:54.537 --> 1:29:55.437
Hey boss.

1:30:01.010 --> 1:30:02.611
Give me a scotch.

1:30:04.013 --> 1:30:05.879
Did Dom call?

1:30:05.881 --> 1:30:07.514
Been fucking calling everybody.

1:30:07.516 --> 1:30:09.616
Nobody's answering.

1:30:09.618 --> 1:30:12.052
I'm gonna send out some more
guys.

1:30:12.054 --> 1:30:12.886
That's it.

1:30:12.888 --> 1:30:14.855
There's nobody left, T.

1:30:14.857 --> 1:30:16.959
You're still breathing.

1:30:18.093 --> 1:30:19.161
Yeah, okay.

1:30:20.896 --> 1:30:21.729
Fuck it.

1:30:41.917 --> 1:30:42.750
Shit.

1:30:43.953 --> 1:30:45.521
What the fuck, Gus?

1:30:51.527 --> 1:30:53.193
What can I do for you?

1:30:53.195 --> 1:30:55.229
I have a deliver for Mr. Divalo.

1:30:55.231 --> 1:30:56.196
From who?

1:30:56.198 --> 1:30:57.366
Mrs. Divalo.

1:30:59.868 --> 1:31:01.468
Yeah, my wife.

1:31:01.470 --> 1:31:03.370
She always wants
to make sure I eat.

1:31:03.372 --> 1:31:04.438
What do I owe you.

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:05.973
Oh it's taken care of.

1:31:05.975 --> 1:31:08.809
Well let me give you a tip.

1:31:08.811 --> 1:31:09.812
Here you go.

1:31:11.146 --> 1:31:12.881
Gee, thanks mister.

1:31:14.316 --> 1:31:15.150
Enjoy.

1:32:11.307 --> 1:32:12.141
Someone!

1:32:13.142 --> 1:32:13.976
Help!

1:32:18.981 --> 1:32:20.547
Hey!

1:32:29.591 --> 1:32:30.426
Help!

1:32:32.461 --> 1:32:33.295
Help!

1:32:54.616 --> 1:32:56.285
He give you a tip?

1:32:57.553 --> 1:32:58.752
Just this.

1:32:58.754 --> 1:33:00.187
Cheapskate.

1:33:00.189 --> 1:33:01.988
I've killed people for less.

1:33:27.349 --> 1:33:29.351
Mr. Wiley?

1:33:32.921 --> 1:33:33.756
Mr. Wiley?

1:33:39.128 --> 1:33:39.962
Mr. Wiley!

1:33:43.833 --> 1:33:44.666
Mr. Wiley?

1:33:49.905 --> 1:33:52.307
I don't know what's going on.

1:34:04.653 --> 1:34:05.719
I smell mom's soda bread.

1:34:05.721 --> 1:34:07.623
You smell that, Mickey?

1:34:10.192 --> 1:34:11.491
Hmm?

1:34:11.493 --> 1:34:13.326
I said you smell mom's soda
bread?

1:34:13.328 --> 1:34:14.528
Jackie.

1:34:14.530 --> 1:34:16.696
Ugh, you woke me up, Jack.

1:34:16.698 --> 1:34:20.467
Fuck, I was getting sleep
finally, Jack.

1:34:20.469 --> 1:34:22.569
I'm freezing, Mick.

1:34:22.571 --> 1:34:24.704
Shouldn't be too much longer,
Jackie.

1:34:24.706 --> 1:34:27.140
What, you've been saying that
for two hours.

1:34:27.142 --> 1:34:28.843
I don't know how much blood I
got let in me.

1:34:28.845 --> 1:34:31.211
Enough that it's keeping your
fucking lips moving.

1:34:31.213 --> 1:34:33.213
I'm in pain, Mick.

1:34:33.215 --> 1:34:34.281
Okay?

1:34:34.283 --> 1:34:36.316
Have a little compassion for
your older brother.

1:34:36.318 --> 1:34:38.218
You do realize I got shot too
right?

1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:39.085
You realize that?

1:34:39.087 --> 1:34:41.121
Yeah, yours went
clean through, man.

1:34:41.123 --> 1:34:43.623
Mine's stuck in my femur.

1:34:43.625 --> 1:34:47.494
They blew off my
middle fucking fingers.

1:34:47.496 --> 1:34:50.664
Better than being shot in your
head.

1:34:50.666 --> 1:34:53.600
Plus you're the idiot that
decided to taunt two hitmen.

1:34:53.602 --> 1:34:54.802
Women.

1:34:54.804 --> 1:34:57.706
Whatever the fuck they are,
people.

1:34:59.274 --> 1:35:00.173
What'd you say?

1:35:00.175 --> 1:35:01.508
Huh?

1:35:01.510 --> 1:35:02.777
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

1:35:02.779 --> 1:35:03.610
Huh?

1:35:03.612 --> 1:35:04.444
No you're not.

1:35:04.446 --> 1:35:06.146
Jackie, don't fall, Jack.

1:35:06.148 --> 1:35:07.849
I'm just gonna take a little
nap.

1:35:07.851 --> 1:35:09.817
No Jackie, don't fall asleep,
Jack.

1:35:09.819 --> 1:35:12.219
Jackie, you can't fall asleep,
Jackie.

1:35:12.221 --> 1:35:14.389
Jackie, don't fall asleep.

1:35:15.524 --> 1:35:16.356
Jack.

1:35:16.358 --> 1:35:18.558
Jack, no you can't sleep,
Jackie.

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:22.062
Jackie, don't fall asleep,
Jackie!

1:35:22.064 --> 1:35:22.897
Jackie!

1:35:24.233 --> 1:35:25.065
Get up!

1:35:25.067 --> 1:35:26.032
Don't fall asleep!

1:35:26.034 --> 1:35:30.504
Okay, I'm awake, you fucking
son of a bitch!

1:35:30.506 --> 1:35:31.340
I'm awake!

1:35:33.008 --> 1:35:33.941
Look at me.

1:35:33.943 --> 1:35:34.775
What?

1:35:34.777 --> 1:35:35.609
Look at me.

1:35:35.611 --> 1:35:36.443
I'm looking at you.

1:35:36.445 --> 1:35:37.277
I love you.

1:35:37.279 --> 1:35:38.111
You're squeezing me hard.

1:35:38.113 --> 1:35:38.980
I love you, Jackie.

1:35:38.982 --> 1:35:39.814
Okay.

1:35:39.816 --> 1:35:40.614
Look in my eyes.

1:35:40.616 --> 1:35:42.048
I don't want you to fucking die.

1:35:42.050 --> 1:35:43.617
Don't die.

1:35:43.619 --> 1:35:44.952
Okay.

1:35:44.954 --> 1:35:45.786
I'm not dying.

1:35:45.788 --> 1:35:47.187
Y'all motherfuckers call for a
cab?

1:35:47.189 --> 1:35:48.355
Hey.

1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:53.393
I told you, Jackie!

1:35:53.395 --> 1:35:54.628
I told you.

1:35:54.630 --> 1:35:55.662
What the hell took you so long?

1:35:55.664 --> 1:35:57.297
I'm bleeding out over here, Pat.

1:35:57.299 --> 1:35:58.365
Well I can come back when

1:35:58.367 --> 1:35:59.499
you're through if you want.

1:35:59.501 --> 1:36:00.333
How about that?

1:36:02.070 --> 1:36:02.870
Ow!

1:36:02.872 --> 1:36:03.838
Christ, you two look like

1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:05.372
two pieces of shit on a
Triscuit.

1:36:05.374 --> 1:36:06.239
Yeah?

1:36:06.241 --> 1:36:07.574
You should see the
other dead guys.

1:36:08.544 --> 1:36:09.442
What about the girl?

1:36:09.444 --> 1:36:10.445
Is she safe?

1:36:11.513 --> 1:36:14.249
It would depend on who you ask.

1:36:15.150 --> 1:36:16.716
Praise the Lord.

1:36:16.718 --> 1:36:18.285
Would you look at that?

1:36:18.287 --> 1:36:19.119
Okay, he's slipping.

1:36:19.121 --> 1:36:19.954
Come on, let's go.

1:36:19.956 --> 1:36:20.788
Get the fuck up.

1:36:20.790 --> 1:36:21.621
Come on, let's go.

1:36:21.623 --> 1:36:22.589
No, hold on!

1:36:22.591 --> 1:36:24.691
Come on man, you don't have
time to wait!

1:36:24.693 --> 1:36:25.893
You're dying!

1:36:25.895 --> 1:36:26.726
Look at that.

1:36:26.728 --> 1:36:27.561
What Jackie?

1:36:27.563 --> 1:36:28.395
What am I looking at?

1:36:28.397 --> 1:36:29.296
On the bookshelf.

1:36:29.298 --> 1:36:30.263
Is that weed?

1:36:30.265 --> 1:36:31.164
Look at that.

1:36:31.166 --> 1:36:33.266
It's a four-leaf fucking clover.

1:36:33.268 --> 1:36:36.403
Well maybe your luck is about
to change.

1:36:36.405 --> 1:36:38.538
It's like the one I broke of
mom's that she gave you.

1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:39.372
Yeah, it's just like it.

1:36:39.374 --> 1:36:40.507
Yeah.

1:36:40.509 --> 1:36:43.243
I'm sorry about that, Jackie.

1:36:43.245 --> 1:36:44.411
Hey Jack.

1:36:44.413 --> 1:36:46.413
Maybe we can reopen the bar now.

1:36:46.415 --> 1:36:47.647
Huh?

1:36:47.649 --> 1:36:49.850
That's a great idea.

1:36:49.852 --> 1:36:52.319
So while you two are having a
sentimental moment,

1:36:52.321 --> 1:36:54.889
I just wanna let you know
you're in the backseat, okay?

1:36:54.891 --> 1:36:56.089
I have new Corinthian leather

1:36:56.091 --> 1:36:57.324
and you're not fucking it up.

1:36:57.326 --> 1:36:58.358
I'm so sick of you white boys,

1:36:58.360 --> 1:36:59.794
I don't know what to do with
myself.

1:36:59.796 --> 1:37:03.597
Yo, and that motherfucker's not
getting in.

1:37:03.599 --> 1:37:04.764
The fuck!

1:37:04.766 --> 1:37:06.166
Let's go!

1:37:06.168 --> 1:37:07.003
Come on!

1:37:08.770 --> 1:37:10.303
Oh shit, Jackie, you know what
I just remembered?

1:37:10.305 --> 1:37:11.137
What?

1:37:11.139 --> 1:37:12.873
Larry's still at the bar.

1:37:12.875 --> 1:37:14.207
- One, two.
- No!

1:37:24.386 --> 1:37:25.853
Did you like that?

1:37:25.855 --> 1:37:28.789
I thought it was pretty good.
