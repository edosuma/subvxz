<i>Hey, Dylan.</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:34.040
Why have you got your coat on?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.040
Are you naked underneath?

00:34.080 --> 00:36.240
<i>Look, we need to talk.</i>

00:36.280 --> 00:37.800
We're gonna talk,

00:36.280 --> 00:37.800
all right.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.600
<i>Dylan, this isn't gonna</i>

00:37.840 --> 00:40.600

00:40.640 --> 00:42.640
<i>-You're dumped.</i>

-What?

00:42.680 --> 00:45.080
<i>-I've met someone else.</i>

00:42.680 --> 00:45.080
-Who?

00:45.120 --> 00:47.520
<i>A guy at uni.</i>

00:45.120 --> 00:47.520
<i>You'd like him actually.</i>

00:47.560 --> 00:50.400
Well, I fucking doubt it!

00:47.560 --> 00:50.400
Why are you doing this?

00:50.440 --> 00:53.160
<i>I don't know, maybe</i>

00:50.440 --> 00:53.160
<i>he's just better than you.</i>

00:53.200 --> 00:54.440
What, you mean sex-wise?

00:54.480 --> 00:56.920
<i>Well, yeah,</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:56.920
<i>but also generally.</i>

00:56.960 --> 00:59.400
This is the worst wank ever.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.360
<i>-You ready, babe?</i>

00:59.440 --> 01:01.360
<i>-Yeah, almost done.</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:03.600
He's there?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.600
In the room with you?

01:03.640 --> 01:06.120
That is it! Right, Zoe,

01:03.640 --> 01:06.120
I'm going to go out tonight

01:06.160 --> 01:09.840
and I am going to pull

01:06.160 --> 01:09.840
so many girls

01:06.160 --> 01:09.840
and I am gonna bang...

01:19.120 --> 01:20.640
Work weekend!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.880
I hope it's not bloody

01:20.680 --> 01:22.880
paintballing again.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.920
Briony from head office

01:22.920 --> 01:26.920
has got it in for me and

01:22.920 --> 01:26.920
those pellets really smart.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.120
Dylan, you have only

01:26.960 --> 01:30.120
been there for three weeks!

01:30.160 --> 01:32.400
No, I don't think

01:30.160 --> 01:32.400
it's been "a good innings".

01:32.440 --> 01:35.360
Don't use

01:32.440 --> 01:35.360
cricketing terminology

01:32.440 --> 01:35.360
to try and get around me.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.400
Look, just don't do

01:35.400 --> 01:38.400
anything stupid,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.400
I'll call you back.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.000
What's happened?

01:40.040 --> 01:42.120
It's Dylan. He wants

01:40.040 --> 01:42.120
to drop out of university.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.400
What? He's only

01:42.160 --> 01:44.400
been there a month.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.960
I know! And what a lovely

01:44.440 --> 01:46.960
month it's been.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.440
Oh, well,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.440
if he doesn't like it.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.560
He's never been at home

01:49.480 --> 01:51.560
in Academia, Ken.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.320
He's not in Academia, Lorna.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.320
He's doing Media Studies.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.880
And besides,

01:55.360 --> 01:57.880
university's about

01:55.360 --> 01:57.880
more than that.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.400
It's about Dylan discovering

01:57.920 --> 02:00.400
himself as a person,

02:00.440 --> 02:02.320
whilst not living

02:00.440 --> 02:02.320
in my house.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.240
It's not the end

02:02.360 --> 02:04.240
of the world, Dad.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.240
I never went to uni.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.160
-And look what happened there.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.160
-Oh. What did happen?

02:08.560 --> 02:12.640
You became a lovely

02:08.560 --> 02:12.640
rounded young lady

02:12.680 --> 02:14.640
with a worthy job

02:12.680 --> 02:14.640
in charity.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.840
Whoo! Great run, Dale.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.920
Morning, guys.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.240
Dylan's not like you,

02:18.960 --> 02:21.240
someone's going to talk

02:18.960 --> 02:21.240
the toe-rag into staying.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.480
You'll have to go

02:21.280 --> 02:23.480
to the university.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.920
I'm busy team building

02:23.520 --> 02:26.920
with some people I've known

02:23.520 --> 02:26.920
for over 10 years.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.920
Very well, once again

02:26.960 --> 02:30.920
I shall shoulder the burden

02:26.960 --> 02:30.920
of the responsible parenting.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.880
Good. I'm just going to go

02:30.960 --> 02:33.880
and say goodbye

02:30.960 --> 02:33.880
to my little Siddlediddle.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.560
Wait! You're going

02:33.920 --> 02:37.560
to visit Dylan at university?

02:33.920 --> 02:37.560
I wanna come.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.160
You can't.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.160
It's going to be

02:37.600 --> 02:40.160
a tricky situation so...

02:40.200 --> 02:43.120
Well, I'll help out!

02:40.200 --> 02:43.120
And I won't take no

02:40.200 --> 02:43.120
as an answer!

02:43.160 --> 02:45.080
Yeah? What if it's

02:43.160 --> 02:45.080
a really firm no?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.440
Won't take it.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.040
I might try anyway,

02:46.480 --> 02:48.040
see how I get on.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.200
No?

02:49.240 --> 02:50.760
I'm still coming!

02:56.440 --> 02:57.880
-Hi.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.200
I have always wanted

02:57.920 --> 03:00.200
to see a university.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.400
-What do people usually wear?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.400
-Are you sure you wanna go?

03:02.440 --> 03:05.520
I'm looking after baby Sid

03:02.440 --> 03:05.520
on my own today.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.520
He's quite a handful.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.480
Which Frisbee should I bring,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.480
red or yellow?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.520
I mean, you could stay

03:07.520 --> 03:09.520
and help me out.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.680
And miss out on university?

03:09.560 --> 03:12.680
[laughs] No thanks!

03:12.720 --> 03:17.040
Because otherwise

03:12.720 --> 03:17.040
it's just me on my own

03:17.080 --> 03:21.560
in the house.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.560
Could get pretty boring...

03:21.600 --> 03:23.680
Then I'll definitely go

03:21.600 --> 03:23.680
with Chief Ken!

03:23.720 --> 03:26.000
Okay, fine,

03:23.720 --> 03:26.000
suit yourself.

03:26.040 --> 03:30.240
Oh, students wear

03:26.040 --> 03:30.240
ties, hats and blazers,

03:26.040 --> 03:30.240
but only on Fridays.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.200
-Today's Friday!

03:30.280 --> 03:32.200
-Yes, it is.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.640
Thanks.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.200
[sighs]

03:41.200 --> 03:42.960
Did you go to university,

03:41.200 --> 03:42.960
Chief Ken?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.040
Yes, I did, back in the days

03:43.000 --> 03:46.040
when it meant something.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.000
Not like these days

03:46.080 --> 03:49.000
where kids leave

03:46.080 --> 03:49.000
with a 30 grand debt

03:49.040 --> 03:51.040
and a degree

03:49.040 --> 03:51.040
in Golf Course Management.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.800
They have golf courses?

03:51.080 --> 03:53.800
That's amazing!

03:53.840 --> 03:57.000
I had some of the best days

03:53.840 --> 03:57.000
of my life at university.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.080
Getting drunk

03:57.040 --> 03:59.080
with pretty girls,

03:59.120 --> 04:00.880
banging on

03:59.120 --> 04:00.880
about the Miners' Strike

04:00.920 --> 04:02.760
and how much

04:00.920 --> 04:02.760
I hated Thatcher.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.200
Thatcher? Who's he?

04:04.240 --> 04:05.680
Never mind.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.040
You're so smart.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.000
Which is weird

04:09.080 --> 04:11.000
'cause if Dylan drops out

04:11.040 --> 04:14.320
-then none of your kids

04:11.040 --> 04:14.320
will have gone to university.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.320
-Oh, God.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.440
Except for Sid, of course.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.840
By the time

04:16.480 --> 04:18.840
he's old enough who knows

04:16.480 --> 04:18.840
if you'll even be alive.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.840
Yeah, all right. Can you

04:18.880 --> 04:22.840
take those clothes off now,

04:18.880 --> 04:22.840
you look like Jimmy Krankie.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.920
-Is that bad?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.920
-Yes.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.360
-Worse than Thatcher?

04:26.240 --> 04:28.360
-Uh...

04:30.280 --> 04:31.640
No.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.280
[GRUNTING] Oh, come on,

04:35.360 --> 04:39.280
you bastard.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.200
Come on!

04:41.240 --> 04:42.840
[doorbell rings]

04:45.800 --> 04:47.840
<i>Guten morgen, meine</i> Rachel.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.320
Ben. I was just heading out.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.240
I was just dropping this

04:49.360 --> 04:51.240
for your Dad.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.320
I have had a letter published

04:51.280 --> 04:54.320
in the<i> Solicitors Journal.</i>

04:54.360 --> 04:56.280
Oh, well done!

04:56.320 --> 04:58.520
It's nothing really,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.520
just a few lines about

04:56.320 --> 04:58.520
a minor factual error.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.440
Page 17,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.440
if you're interested.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.880
I've marked it

05:00.480 --> 05:02.880
with a yellow tab.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.880
And circled it in red.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.080
Oh, great, thanks.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.840
You don't know anything

05:05.120 --> 05:07.840
about pushchairs, do you?

05:05.120 --> 05:07.840
This one's jammed.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.600
Let me have a look.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.280
Ah, the Jill Cotterill.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.280
Good unit.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.160
I used to browse round

05:12.320 --> 05:17.160
Mothercare back when I

05:12.320 --> 05:17.160
thought you and I might...

05:17.200 --> 05:20.160
Never mind. There is

05:17.200 --> 05:20.160
a safety catch here

05:20.200 --> 05:23.440
and then it just flicks out.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.480
-Oh, brilliant!

05:23.480 --> 05:25.480
-[chuckles]

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
Now I've just got

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
to push him round Tescos

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
and get loads of stuff.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.960
Mum's gone away,

05:28.640 --> 05:31.960
Dad and Dale are

05:28.640 --> 05:31.960
off to see Dylan.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.880
And I'm left on my own.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.280
Incredible idea alert!

05:36.320 --> 05:38.680
Why don't you stay here

05:36.320 --> 05:38.680
and I'll go do the shopping.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.400
Oh, bit of a hassle.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.400
Not for "Bestie Ben"!

05:40.440 --> 05:42.400
I'll get everything you need.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.760
Maybe pick us up

05:42.440 --> 05:44.760
something nice for dinner.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.880
Ben, you are amazing.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.280
-Yes, I am.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.280
-[both chuckle]

05:48.320 --> 05:51.400
Okay. Bye-bye, Sid.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.400
See you later.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.840
[sighs]

05:52.880 --> 05:55.120
Oh, that's nice

05:52.880 --> 05:55.120
of Uncle Ben, isn't it?

05:55.160 --> 05:56.720
Come on, Sid.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.080
Okay, when we find Dylan,

06:06.600 --> 06:10.080
let me do the talking.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.080
All right?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.960
Why? I'm super persuasive.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.480
We're not going

06:12.000 --> 06:13.480
to kidnap him

06:13.520 --> 06:14.960
or cut his thumb off,

06:13.520 --> 06:14.960
are we?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.520
As much as he

06:15.000 --> 06:16.520
deserves it.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.400
Okay. Maybe just

06:16.560 --> 06:18.400
slap him a little.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.880
No! We're going to be firm

06:18.440 --> 06:21.880
but fair, all right?

06:22.640 --> 06:23.880
Oh.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.640
Please, can you move your car?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.800
Sorry, what?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.680
I said,

06:29.840 --> 06:31.680
can you move your car.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.080
Can I move my car?

06:34.040 --> 06:35.360
There's plenty of spaces.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.840
That space is

06:35.400 --> 06:37.840
for electric vehicles.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.080
Sorry, it's for what?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.720
Electric vehicles.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.120
Electric vehicles?

06:40.760 --> 06:44.120
It's not very clearly marked.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.440
Maybe I'll leave my car

06:48.640 --> 06:50.440
where it is.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.720
Well, maybe I'll call

06:50.480 --> 06:52.720
the clamping firm.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.400
Is this a university

06:52.760 --> 06:55.400
or a prison?

06:55.440 --> 06:57.120
-Thatcher!

06:55.440 --> 06:57.120
-Well said, Dale.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.800
-Jimmy Krankie!

06:57.160 --> 06:59.800
-Not as relevant,

06:57.160 --> 06:59.800
but still good.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.840
Fine, I'll move.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
-[music playing]

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
-[knocking on door]

07:16.920 --> 07:19.240
Dylan, I know

07:16.920 --> 07:19.240
you're in there.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.400
I can hear your music.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.840
[music stops]

07:22.880 --> 07:26.480
Ah, sneaky and stupid.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.480
A terrible combination.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.320
[grunting]

07:30.360 --> 07:33.040
Do you have

07:30.360 --> 07:33.040
a credit card?

07:33.080 --> 07:36.360
I learned this

07:33.080 --> 07:36.360
lock picking technique

07:33.080 --> 07:36.360
when I was in China.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.080
All right.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.800
-That'll work.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.800
-Yeah.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.320
What the fuck?

07:48.360 --> 07:51.400
I can never remember

07:48.360 --> 07:51.400
what that's for.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.200
Right, young man,

07:51.440 --> 07:53.200
we need to talk.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.080
Leave me alone.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.080
I know what you're

07:53.240 --> 07:55.080
going to say,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.200
but you don't understand,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.200
I hate it here.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.480
Should I slap him?

07:58.520 --> 07:59.920
No!

08:01.280 --> 08:03.960
Dylan...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
University is

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
a really important time

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
in a young person's life.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.960
-I just don't want you

08:08.520 --> 08:10.960
to miss out.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.960
-God, you're such a dick!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.960
-Dale, slap him.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.960
-Face or neck?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.560
Fine, then I'll get

08:13.000 --> 08:15.560
the train home then.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.560
But leave me alone!

08:15.600 --> 08:17.360
[Dylan crying]

08:17.400 --> 08:20.400
Are you... Are you crying?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.800
Is it because of the door?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.400
No, you twat,

08:21.840 --> 08:24.400
it's because of Zoe.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.920
She dumped me

08:24.440 --> 08:26.920
and now she's seeing

08:24.440 --> 08:26.920
this other guy.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.560
It sounds really lame,

08:26.960 --> 08:29.560
but I really love the bitch.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.160
Oh, God,

08:29.600 --> 08:31.160
I'm so depressed.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.640
Listen, love,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.640
the thing is...

08:33.680 --> 08:35.520
Hey, I got this.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.400
Hey, Dyllie...

08:38.440 --> 08:44.000
Look here. Zoe is

08:38.440 --> 08:44.000
with another guy now.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.760
And they did

08:44.040 --> 08:45.760
just get together

08:45.800 --> 08:48.600
so you have to understand

08:45.800 --> 08:48.600
that at this moment

08:48.640 --> 08:50.880
they are pretty busy

08:48.640 --> 08:50.880
intercoursing often.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.920
Oh, God!

08:52.960 --> 08:56.000
Dale maybe go and explore

08:52.960 --> 08:56.000
the campus for a bit?

08:56.040 --> 08:59.000
-Maybe find that golf course?

08:56.040 --> 08:59.000
-Maybe find that golf course.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.360
-I'm gonna find it!

08:59.040 --> 09:01.360
-[laughs]

09:01.400 --> 09:03.840
Look, Dad,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.840
it's not just Zoe,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.840
it's everything.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.920
This place, the people,

09:03.880 --> 09:05.920
the courses.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.840
I've tried, Dad,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.840
I've tried so hard,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.840
I promise.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.160
But it's like you said.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.160
Media Studies is shit.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.440
All right.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.440
But you're getting a job

09:15.800 --> 09:19.440
and you're paying rent.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.840
Deal.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.640
University is such a rip off.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.640
I mean, you pay nine grand

09:25.560 --> 09:29.640
and you get this.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.680
[whispering]

09:31.280 --> 09:33.680
Nine grand? Shit.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.120
But thanks for

09:33.720 --> 09:36.120
putting me first, Dad.

09:36.160 --> 09:41.960
Hey, come on, you're my son.

09:36.160 --> 09:41.960
Nothing is more important

09:36.160 --> 09:41.960
than that.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.480
Just out of interest,

09:42.000 --> 09:46.480
who does look after

09:42.000 --> 09:46.480
the money here?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.320
I'm so sorry about that

09:46.520 --> 09:49.320
little misunderstanding

09:46.520 --> 09:49.320
earlier,

09:49.360 --> 09:51.920
I was very tired

09:49.360 --> 09:51.920
after a long drive.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.840
Although it was

09:51.960 --> 09:54.840
rather inconvenient...

09:54.880 --> 09:57.880
Okay. I just wanted

09:54.880 --> 09:57.880
to clarify something.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.560
My son, Dylan Thomson,

09:57.920 --> 10:01.560
he's going to be dropping out.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.480
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.480
We'll miss him.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.160
Sorry, do you mind

10:04.520 --> 10:07.160
if I move a bit closer,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.160
I'm struggling to...

10:07.200 --> 10:08.880
Yeah.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
So it's just

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
the small matter

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
of the tuition fees

10:11.040 --> 10:12.760
and when they would

10:11.040 --> 10:12.760
be refunded?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.040
Oh.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.720
-Let's have a look.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.720
-Thanks.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.960
-Hmm... Never.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.960
-What?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.840
They're non-refundable.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.560
He's been here for one month,

10:24.880 --> 10:28.560
and I've paid 9,000 pounds,

10:28.600 --> 10:30.960
so give me 8,500

10:28.600 --> 10:30.960
and we'll call it quits.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.640
Non-refundable

10:31.000 --> 10:33.640
and non-negotiable.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.440
But I've told him

10:33.680 --> 10:35.440
he can leave.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.040
All right, eight grand,

10:36.480 --> 10:40.040
final offer.

10:40.080 --> 10:44.160
Thank you,

10:40.080 --> 10:44.160
you're printing me

10:40.080 --> 10:44.160
a receipt.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.760
Clause 17

10:44.200 --> 10:47.760
on the fees contract.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.760
Zero refunds.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.480
Dylan is a bright boy.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.800
And this university has failed

10:50.520 --> 10:53.800
to stimulate his keen mind.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.760
According to our files

10:53.840 --> 10:56.760
he hasn't been

10:53.840 --> 10:56.760
to a single lecture.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.040
What?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.320
Okay.

11:09.840 --> 11:16.120
I'm a lawyer.

11:09.840 --> 11:16.120
And I'm going to tell you

11:09.840 --> 11:16.120
something just once.

11:16.160 --> 11:20.400
If I walk out of that door

11:16.160 --> 11:20.400
without the tuition fees

11:20.440 --> 11:24.000
there will be

11:20.440 --> 11:24.000
serious consequences.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.400
Mmm-hmm.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.400
Mmm-hmm.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.680
Okay.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.280
Very well.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.280
You leave me no choice.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.280
Seven-and-a-half grand,

11:49.920 --> 11:52.280
final offer.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.880
[Sid cooing]

11:57.440 --> 11:59.600
There you are!

11:59.640 --> 12:01.800
Here's dinner

11:59.640 --> 12:01.800
and until then,

12:01.840 --> 12:06.280
I have an array

12:01.840 --> 12:06.280
of Iberian hams

12:01.840 --> 12:06.280
and dip-worthy snacks.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.080
This is amazing. Let me go

12:06.320 --> 12:09.080
and get you some money.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.160
No, it's on me.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.160
I thought,

12:11.200 --> 12:13.640
"Hey, we're stuck indoors,

12:11.200 --> 12:13.640
might as well

12:11.200 --> 12:13.640
make the best of it."

12:13.680 --> 12:18.440
You know, two besties.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.440
Wine. A box-set.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.440
Bit like old times, eh?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.520
Did you get changed?

12:20.560 --> 12:23.120
Yeah, I bought a couple

12:20.560 --> 12:23.120
of things whilst I was out.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.120
A shirt, some shoes.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.960
-And after shave.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.960
-Do you like it?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.320
-It's quite strong, isn't it?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.320
-I know!

12:27.360 --> 12:28.920
[chuckles]

12:30.960 --> 12:32.840
Oh, I loved that!

12:33.280 --> 12:34.680
Hmm.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.560
Look at Sid!

12:34.720 --> 12:37.560
He's still bouncing!

12:37.600 --> 12:39.400
Have you been going

12:37.600 --> 12:39.400
to the gym?

12:39.440 --> 12:43.080
You know, single man.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.080
Got to keep standards up.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.480
What has been happening

12:43.120 --> 12:45.480
with your romantic life?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.080
You've kept your cards

12:45.520 --> 12:48.080
very close to your chest.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.680
Oh, okay, well, there's been

12:48.120 --> 12:51.680
a variety of girls.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.000
-Mmm-hmm.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.000
-All really smoking.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.000
But I'm just not sure

12:54.040 --> 12:58.000
I'm ready to get into

12:54.040 --> 12:58.000
a relationship, you know?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.280
However much they plead.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.880
Whoever you choose,

13:00.320 --> 13:02.880
they'll be a very lucky girl.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.440
-Think we should have

13:02.920 --> 13:05.440
that food then?

13:02.920 --> 13:05.440
-Hell yeah.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.720
-Yeah? Okay.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.720
-I'll pop it in the microwave.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.440
Oh, Mum gave me 40 quid

13:07.760 --> 13:12.440
for the shopping,

13:07.760 --> 13:12.440
please take it.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.280
No way, bestay!

13:14.320 --> 13:16.560
I'm putting the money

13:14.320 --> 13:16.560
in your wallet.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.560
Is it in your coat?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
Do not go

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
near my coat!

13:18.640 --> 13:20.240
Oh, what's that?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.840
Don't open it.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.680
Oh, the engagement ring.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.280
It's, um...

13:29.320 --> 13:32.800
I keep it on me

13:29.320 --> 13:32.800
when I see you.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.800
Just in case...

13:32.840 --> 13:36.120
So, I mean, when you said

13:32.840 --> 13:36.120
we were past

13:32.840 --> 13:36.120
all that old stuff...

13:38.960 --> 13:41.440
Oh. Listen, Sid's fine.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.200
Thanks for getting dinner

13:41.480 --> 13:45.200
and everything.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.200
It was lovely.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.240
Yeah. Okay.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.440
Oh, the ready meal.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.040
Don't forget to pierce the film

13:52.480 --> 13:55.040
before you put it

13:52.480 --> 13:55.040
in the microwave.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.400
Okay.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.720
Can I have my ring back,

13:56.440 --> 13:57.720
please?

13:57.760 --> 13:59.080
Oh, yeah.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.000
-Oh, shit!

14:01.520 --> 14:03.000
-What?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.440
Well, I can't see the ring.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.800
What do you mean?

14:05.840 --> 14:08.600
Oh, God, it must have

14:05.840 --> 14:08.600
fallen onto him.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.280
I think Sid might

14:08.640 --> 14:11.280
have swallowed it.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.800
Oh, God!

14:12.840 --> 14:14.880
Ben, what do we do?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.800
I don't know!

14:14.920 --> 14:16.800
I mean, I could try and claim

14:14.920 --> 14:16.800
on my contents insurance,

14:16.840 --> 14:19.360
-but there'll be a hell

14:16.840 --> 14:19.360
of an excess to pay!

14:16.840 --> 14:19.360
-What?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.360
Oh, God, and now

14:19.400 --> 14:21.360
I have a nosebleed!

14:21.400 --> 14:23.320
-[screaming]

14:21.400 --> 14:23.320
-Oh, Siddie.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.120
Oh, God.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.520
Okay, slight change

14:28.800 --> 14:31.520
of plan.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.600
Instead of leaving university

14:31.560 --> 14:34.600
you are in fact now staying.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.520
What? Why?

14:36.560 --> 14:39.840
Look, Dylan, I just hate

14:36.560 --> 14:39.840
for you to throw away

14:39.880 --> 14:42.240
a perfectly good career

14:39.880 --> 14:42.240
in Media Studies.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.120
You didn't get

14:42.280 --> 14:44.120
your money back, did you?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.760
Look, I don't want

14:44.160 --> 14:45.760
to go all draconian

14:44.160 --> 14:45.760
about it, right,

14:45.800 --> 14:47.360
but I've paid nine grand

14:45.800 --> 14:47.360
for you to be here

14:47.400 --> 14:50.040
so I essentially own you.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.040
For at least one year.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.440
Well, that's slavery!

14:51.480 --> 14:53.680
Yes. Well, maybe slavery

14:51.480 --> 14:53.680
isn't that bad,

14:53.720 --> 14:55.640
think of all the music

14:53.720 --> 14:55.640
it gave us.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.480
Come on, Dylan,

14:56.920 --> 14:59.480
give this place

14:56.920 --> 14:59.480
another chance.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.440
I only came to uni

14:59.520 --> 15:02.440
to have a laugh,

14:59.520 --> 15:02.440
but it's so lame here.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.000
It's full of sad twats

15:02.480 --> 15:05.000
and international students.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.880
All they have is

15:05.040 --> 15:08.880
a library, a shit bar

15:05.040 --> 15:08.880
and a pond full of geese.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.040
They're ducks, mate.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.600
You're always criticizing me!

15:12.640 --> 15:16.720
[sighs] Look, Dylan,

15:12.640 --> 15:16.720
university is amazing.

15:16.760 --> 15:21.240
Think of all the parties

15:16.760 --> 15:21.240
and the protest marches...

15:21.280 --> 15:23.800
Yeah, okay, forget

15:21.280 --> 15:23.800
the protest marches,

15:23.840 --> 15:26.560
There'll be someone here

15:23.840 --> 15:26.560
for you to have a laugh with.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
Guys, wanna come

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
play Frisbee with us?

15:28.640 --> 15:29.880
Heads up, Nathan!

15:29.920 --> 15:31.400
Oh! You okay?

15:31.440 --> 15:33.640
Dad, this is

15:31.440 --> 15:33.640
the lamest place ever.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.640
Don't be a quitter.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.440
Hey! Let's go have a pint

15:35.680 --> 15:38.440
in the student's union bar,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.600
that's where

15:38.480 --> 15:40.600
all the laughs start.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.240
[music playing]

15:46.360 --> 15:49.960
See, this place

15:46.360 --> 15:49.960
isn't too bad.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.440
I'm sure

15:50.000 --> 15:51.440
it'll pick up later.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.520
It won't.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.520
This is as good as it gets.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.640
[sighs]

15:55.680 --> 15:59.400
Where's the band posters?

15:55.680 --> 15:59.400
Where's the guy

15:55.680 --> 15:59.400
selling socialist worker?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.360
Where's the

15:59.440 --> 16:01.360
10p a pint signs?

16:01.400 --> 16:04.160
Last week they

16:01.400 --> 16:04.160
had a talk about

16:01.400 --> 16:04.160
alcohol awareness.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.680
Unbelievable.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.440
Is that kid doing an essay?

16:09.480 --> 16:11.960
There's not even

16:09.480 --> 16:11.960
any graffiti in the bogs.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
What? There's got to be

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
an anarchy sign

16:14.040 --> 16:15.600
or a badly drawn

16:14.040 --> 16:15.600
cock and balls.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.680
-No.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.680
-This place is a disgrace.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.240
[laughing]

16:19.280 --> 16:23.000
I love university!

16:19.280 --> 16:23.000
I have made

16:19.280 --> 16:23.000
so many friends.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.360
See?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.120
Guys, this is Charlie.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.000
Nathan and I were

16:26.160 --> 16:29.000
playing Frisbee

16:26.160 --> 16:29.000
and Charlie joined in...

16:29.040 --> 16:31.080
-What was that word again?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.080
-Ironically.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.280
Ironically. So we played

16:31.120 --> 16:34.280
ironic Frisbee together.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.840
Right, good.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.840
Would you sit down,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.840
Charlie, join us?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.760
No-one really drinks in here.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.760
No-one that I know anyway.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.680
I'm going to a party

16:39.800 --> 16:41.680
at Otley House.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.000
Where's that?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.560
You haven't heard

16:43.040 --> 16:44.560
of Otley House?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.800
Oh, no, yeah.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.800
I've heard of it obviously.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.800
I was being ironic.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.280
[laughs] She loves that!

16:51.320 --> 16:54.760
Well, the party's gonna

16:51.320 --> 16:54.760
be pretty messed up,

16:51.320 --> 16:54.760
you should come.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.240
Bring your granddad, too.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.360
Did you eat

16:58.160 --> 17:01.360
something naughty?

17:01.400 --> 17:04.840
Did your bad, bad sister

17:01.400 --> 17:04.840
feed you something naughty!

17:04.880 --> 17:06.880
I didn't strictly

17:04.880 --> 17:06.880
feed it to him.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.000
Of course not!

17:08.040 --> 17:10.080
But in future,

17:08.040 --> 17:10.080
you should know

17:10.120 --> 17:14.040
feeding babies metal jewelery

17:10.120 --> 17:14.040
is considered bad parenting.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.920
Yeah. I knew.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.640
"Knew." Well, not to worry.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.640
He'll poo it out in a few hours.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.280
-You'll soon have

17:18.680 --> 17:21.280
your engagement ring back.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.280
-Great!

17:21.320 --> 17:23.360
But it's not actually

17:21.320 --> 17:23.360
my engagement ring.

17:23.400 --> 17:28.080
Well, it sort of is.

17:23.400 --> 17:28.080
We were engaged,

17:23.400 --> 17:28.080
and it was the ring.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.480
We weren't.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.480
I said "no".

17:29.520 --> 17:30.800
But you said "yes" first!

17:30.840 --> 17:33.160
Ten seconds.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.160
It still counts.

17:33.200 --> 17:38.040
Okay, well,

17:33.200 --> 17:38.040
as this isn't a medical issue,

17:33.200 --> 17:38.040
I have no comment.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.120
Unless... How old are you?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.120
Twenty-four.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.680
Because statistically

17:42.160 --> 17:44.680
if you haven't met

17:42.160 --> 17:44.680
your husband by 25,

17:44.720 --> 17:46.440
you won't marry till 29,

17:46.480 --> 17:49.680
and childbirth after 30

17:46.480 --> 17:49.680
puts a massive strain

17:46.480 --> 17:49.680
on the NHS.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.240
So, if I did have

17:49.720 --> 17:52.240
to advise you medically...

17:52.280 --> 17:53.600
Have a think about it.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.120
Should your sister

17:55.640 --> 17:59.120
have said yes? Should she?

17:59.160 --> 18:03.280
He looks nice enough.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.280
Handsome!

18:03.320 --> 18:05.280
Should she be

18:03.320 --> 18:05.280
more realistic?

18:05.320 --> 18:07.480
-Okay.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.480
-I think she should.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.040
[dance music playing]

18:20.320 --> 18:22.000
-Hey.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.080
Have you guys got any booze?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.080
We're running low.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.680
In luck! Old guy does.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.680
Now this is more like it.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.880
Hey, guys!

18:28.720 --> 18:30.880
We've got booze!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.800
[all cheering]

18:32.840 --> 18:34.400
I got Frisbee!

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
Now, this is what

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
a credit card is for.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.760
I'm learning so much

18:41.520 --> 18:43.760
at university.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.640
We're gonna

18:44.960 --> 18:46.640
leave you to it.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.600
Yeah. Nice one.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.160
Hey, Dad! I thought

18:49.640 --> 18:53.160
you were gonna be

18:49.640 --> 18:53.160
a right dick about today.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.600
But you were only half

18:53.200 --> 18:56.600
as much of a dick

18:53.200 --> 18:56.600
as I thought you'd be.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.760
Thank you, Dylan.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.440
You can stay for a beer

18:58.800 --> 19:01.440
if you like.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.560
No. You don't want me

19:01.480 --> 19:05.560
hanging around

19:01.480 --> 19:05.560
cramping your style.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.920
Go!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.040
Again!

19:36.680 --> 19:39.720
Okay, Siddie, let's have

19:36.680 --> 19:39.720
a little look at you.

19:41.280 --> 19:46.520
No. Still no joy.

19:41.280 --> 19:46.520
All right then. All right.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.840
Oh, let's warm you up

19:46.560 --> 19:49.840
some more milk.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.480
You okay?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.520
[sighing] Yeah.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.600
Ben, I worry

20:05.560 --> 20:08.600
being friends with me

20:08.640 --> 20:12.680
maybe it's not

20:08.640 --> 20:12.680
the best thing for you

20:08.640 --> 20:12.680
at the moment.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.560
No, no,

20:12.720 --> 20:14.560
it is the best thing.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.480
Can you be honest

20:14.600 --> 20:16.480
for a sec?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.480
It's just so ridiculous.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.840
Dale's in love

20:19.520 --> 20:21.840
with this Ling woman.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.360
You're in love with Dale.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.360
And I'm in...

20:27.000 --> 20:29.880
Oh, God, you're right.

20:31.720 --> 20:36.960
Maybe we should all

20:31.720 --> 20:36.960
have a fresh start

20:31.720 --> 20:36.960
and move on.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.800
The trouble with moving on

20:37.000 --> 20:40.800
is you don't know

20:37.000 --> 20:40.800
what's around the corner.

20:40.840 --> 20:46.880
There could be

20:40.840 --> 20:46.880
a hair-pin bend or a new

20:40.840 --> 20:46.880
boyfriend who really hurts you.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.840
Sometimes when

20:46.920 --> 20:48.840
you're moving on,

20:48.880 --> 20:51.880
you gotta go into reverse

20:48.880 --> 20:51.880
and back up a little.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.600
And as you're backing up

20:51.920 --> 20:54.600
you might be worried

20:54.640 --> 20:56.520
you're going over

20:54.640 --> 20:56.520
old ground,

20:56.560 --> 21:00.640
but actually

20:56.560 --> 21:00.640
it's the best thing

20:56.560 --> 21:00.640
you could possibly do

21:00.680 --> 21:05.920
because the old ground

21:00.680 --> 21:05.920
is safe and reliable

21:05.960 --> 21:07.560
and thinks you're beautiful.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.880
Ben...

21:09.920 --> 21:14.040
And the old ground

21:09.920 --> 21:14.040
will never hurt you

21:09.920 --> 21:14.040
or leave you.

21:14.080 --> 21:19.080
It'll just be glad

21:14.080 --> 21:19.080
that you're, you know,

21:14.080 --> 21:19.080
driving over it again.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.080
Oh, gosh,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.080
can you smell that?

21:26.120 --> 21:27.560
Yeah, I think I can.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.640
I think we have success,

21:29.440 --> 21:31.640
baby Sid.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
Yeah! Oh, bit too much.

I've got another one for you.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
See if you can join along.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.560
This is a little number

21:54.040 --> 21:58.560

22:45.240 --> 22:49.520
This room is a fire risk.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.880
You must all leave

22:49.560 --> 22:51.880
immediately.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.200
Oh, come on, they're just

22:51.920 --> 22:55.200
trying to have a bit of fun.

22:55.240 --> 22:59.080
The party is over.

22:55.240 --> 22:59.080
Everyone please leave.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.680
You square!

23:00.720 --> 23:02.920
<i>-Thatcher!</i>

23:00.720 --> 23:02.920
-Yes, Dale!

23:02.960 --> 23:06.000
Aren't you a bit old

23:02.960 --> 23:06.000
for this kind of thing?

23:06.040 --> 23:10.520
I am not going

23:06.040 --> 23:10.520
to take a lecture

23:06.040 --> 23:10.520
from the likes of you.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.960
Bollocks!

23:13.000 --> 23:15.200
Well, I can see where

23:13.000 --> 23:15.200
he gets that from.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.800
Guys? Guys, wait!

23:20.760 --> 23:22.320
I can see

23:20.760 --> 23:22.320
you all want to go.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.800
You think the party's over.

23:24.840 --> 23:30.480
But before you do,

23:24.840 --> 23:30.480
I want to say

23:24.840 --> 23:30.480
a couple of things, okay?

23:30.520 --> 23:37.240
All it takes

23:30.520 --> 23:37.240
for evil to flourish is

23:30.520 --> 23:37.240
for good men to say nothing.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.760
We have to show

23:37.280 --> 23:40.760
that supercilious bell-end

23:40.800 --> 23:43.920
that we will not be

23:40.800 --> 23:43.920
pushed around by the man.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.560
All right? We must fight

23:43.960 --> 23:48.560
the might of the system!

23:48.600 --> 23:51.960
<i>-Who's with him?</i>

23:48.600 --> 23:51.960
-Who's with me?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.640
Okay.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.880
I'll be honest,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.880
I'm a little disappointed

23:55.680 --> 23:58.880
by the turn out.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.760
Okay, Dad,

24:00.200 --> 24:01.760
what's the plan?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.480
The plan is

24:01.800 --> 24:03.480
we're going to teach

24:03.520 --> 24:06.200
that smug little twat

24:03.520 --> 24:06.200
a lesson he won't forget.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.920
The old classic.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.920
We're gonna turn his car

24:08.960 --> 24:10.920
on its roof.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.040
No, Dad. Stop!

24:12.080 --> 24:13.520
Dylan?

24:13.560 --> 24:17.840
What if we pick it up

24:13.560 --> 24:17.840
and move it over there!

24:17.880 --> 24:19.360
Onto the island.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.600
You are a chip

24:20.640 --> 24:22.600
off the old block.

24:22.640 --> 24:26.080
Okay, boys, let's put

24:22.640 --> 24:26.080
this prick's car

24:22.640 --> 24:26.080
on the island.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.560
Hey, Chief Ken.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.560
This is all allowed

24:26.120 --> 24:29.560
at university?

24:29.600 --> 24:31.360
It's totally fine.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.040

24:33.080 --> 24:38.000

24:38.040 --> 24:40.320

24:38.040 --> 24:40.320

24:43.800 --> 24:45.760
We can do this, guys,

24:52.160 --> 24:53.920
Yes.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.640
Okay, boys.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.640
One last heave.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.960
One, two, three...

25:00.520 --> 25:03.440
Yes, Dad! I am definitely

25:00.520 --> 25:03.440
staying in university!

25:03.480 --> 25:05.800
-I'm so proud of you, son.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.800
-Yeah!

Final offer, five grand.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.720
I can't believe

25:28.880 --> 25:30.720
they kicked me out.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.200
Why did you

25:30.760 --> 25:32.200
make me do that?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.080
You're an adult now,

25:32.240 --> 25:34.080
Dylan,

25:34.120 --> 25:36.720
and as an adult

25:34.120 --> 25:36.720
we take responsibility

25:34.120 --> 25:36.720
for our own actions.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.480
That said,

25:36.760 --> 25:38.480
don't tell your mother.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.360
I can still smell

25:38.520 --> 25:40.360
burning duck.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.920
Yeah, it'll take me a while

25:40.400 --> 25:42.920
until I can have a Chinese.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.960
Still, university was great,

25:42.960 --> 25:45.960
wasn't it?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.720
Can we go back

25:46.000 --> 25:47.720
every weekend?

25:47.760 --> 25:49.360
You are such a fucktard.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.000
Dylan, that's enough.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.440
It's okay, Chief Ken,

25:51.040 --> 25:53.440
he was just being ironic.

25:53.480 --> 25:57.080
Like me saying,

25:53.480 --> 25:57.080
"It's not gonna be great

25:53.480 --> 25:57.080
to have you home again, bro"!

Oh, yeah, I'm not

25:57.120 --> 25:59.560

25:57.120 --> 25:59.560
by the way.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.800

26:00.840 --> 26:02.480
And who's going

26:00.840 --> 26:02.480
to pay for that?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.840
Well, you are,

26:02.520 --> 26:04.840
or I'll tell Mum.
