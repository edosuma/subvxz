WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.917 --> 00:06.041
Get away from her!

00:07.417 --> 00:09.166
Great idea.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.041
Looks like he bought it.
Thanks, Mom.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.458
That's right, little Harris.
Go back to your master.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.208
(Traeger) You've experienced
the effects of the red bloom.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.959
An improvement on the brain bug
you used on Grace, yes?

00:21.041 --> 00:23.583
Is this your way
of carrying out my plan?

00:23.667 --> 00:24.917
Brothers.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.583
(Harper) You've got Grey out there
looking for a place

00:27.667 --> 00:29.166
to grow a lot
of these babies, right?

00:29.250 --> 00:31.166
Pack your sunblock, boys.
We're going to Brazil.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.208
You told me you'd make sure
that Harris didn't escape.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.417
And then you helped him do it!
You're off the team.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.083
(groans) Come on. Come on.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.750
Ryan, your tutor's here.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.834
(scoffs)

00:56.208 --> 00:58.208
-Oh, great.
-What?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.875
I don't know. I was sort of hoping

00:59.959 --> 01:01.792
maybe my tutor would be a cute girl.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.125
Yeah. And your mom
was sort of hoping

01:04.208 --> 01:05.375
you wouldn't be held back.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.083
(laughs)

01:08.166 --> 01:09.291
Hey, I'm Ryan.

01:09.959 --> 01:10.917
You're, uh...

01:11.000 --> 01:13.333
A kid that's lived
on your block for 10 years.

01:13.417 --> 01:16.542
Right! Harris, I--

01:16.625 --> 01:18.917
Sorry, but I didn't recognize you
outside the library.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.917
The library has T3 speed Internet.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.500
Plus, Josie Martin works there
after school every day.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.458
(both) Mm, Josie Martin.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.375
So, what subject are you lame at?

01:28.375 --> 01:29.417
Algebra.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.208
Where are your books?

01:33.291 --> 01:35.709
Books?
What is this, two years ago?

01:35.792 --> 01:37.500
Everything's on my HarpPad.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.500
Let's get this math party started.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.792
Yeah, let me just get this wheel off.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.875
Put that screwdriver right here,

01:46.959 --> 01:49.625
brace it against this part,
then just give the end a tap.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.667
Ah. How'd you do that?

01:52.750 --> 01:54.750
Leverage. The slope of the board

01:54.834 --> 01:56.625
and the distance to the wheel
are covariants.

01:56.709 --> 01:58.125
Covariants?

01:58.208 --> 02:00.583
It means they stick together
no matter what.

02:00.667 --> 02:04.709
So, you just gotta solve
for the angle X, and boom, no more wheel.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.208
-Simple math.
-Okay.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.125
Let's do this.

02:13.917 --> 02:17.000
(baseball game broadcasting
over Mech-Link)

02:17.083 --> 02:18.667
You boys finished
cleaning up in here?

02:21.792 --> 02:23.250
You haven't even started.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.542
(broadcast continuing)

02:26.959 --> 02:27.875
Everything okay?

02:27.959 --> 02:30.000
-Yeah.
-Yep.

02:31.583 --> 02:32.834
You're sure?

02:32.917 --> 02:34.542
Nothing wrong at school?

02:35.625 --> 02:37.500
-In the robot?
-(broadcast clicks off)

02:37.583 --> 02:40.208
Nope.
It's all good, Mom. We're good.

02:42.917 --> 02:45.917
Okay. But I want all this put away.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.417
(Mech-Link beeps)

02:52.166 --> 02:54.542
(Veracity) Ryan, I think I've found
a possible location

02:54.625 --> 02:56.208
in the data core
you found at Harper's.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.041
-(Mech-Link beeps)
-Veracity found Harris.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.583
-So?
-So, what?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.041
-You're not gonna say it?
-Say what?

03:05.125 --> 03:07.125
That you made a mistake
about Harris.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.375
That you're sorry
for doing something so idiotic.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.333
You're being idiotic!
I made the right decision,

03:11.417 --> 03:12.625
and I'd do it again.

03:12.709 --> 03:15.667
-You could've gotten Harris hurt or worse.
-And you wouldn't take that chance?

03:15.750 --> 03:19.125
-Even if it meant saving the world?
-No! Never.

03:20.125 --> 03:23.041
That's too bad...
because a leader would.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.542
You know what? Fine.
I'm gonna go to South America,

03:31.625 --> 03:34.125
stop Traeger and save Harris,
without you.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.125
Fine. And you're welcome.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.500
-For?
-If it weren't for me,

03:39.583 --> 03:40.959
you'd have no idea
where they went.

03:41.667 --> 03:42.959
I'll mention that to Harris.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.291
If he's still alive.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.625
(theme music playing)

04:27.750 --> 04:29.709
So, where are they?

04:29.792 --> 04:32.959
Well, according to the data
that I pulled off this bad boy,

04:33.041 --> 04:36.208
Harper was secretly building
greenhouses all over the world.

04:36.291 --> 04:39.583
Also, he was thinking
of proposing to your mom.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.542
-Ew!
-Over my dead body!

04:43.834 --> 04:44.667
I'm sorry.

04:45.959 --> 04:47.083
Why greenhouses?

04:47.166 --> 04:48.583
After his monster apocalypse,

04:48.667 --> 04:50.834
he was gonna need
a steady supply of food.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.458
This one... is in Brazil.

04:53.542 --> 04:55.542
That makes sense.
They could use the greenhouse

04:55.625 --> 04:56.375
to make the red bloom.

04:56.458 --> 04:57.750
All right. Plot a course.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.166
Don't you think leaving
Mark behind is a bad idea?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.625
You not having a napkin,
that's a bad idea.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.750
Us leaving Mark behind's
a great idea.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.208
He lied to us.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.583
We're supposed to be a team.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.166
Come on, V, back me up.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.959
Yeah, I'm sort of
Team Ryan on this one.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.542
(Veracity) Mark lied to us,
and he lost Harris.

05:15.291 --> 05:16.375
And you do need a napkin.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.792
(Ryan) See, Spyder, we can do this.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.875
I have total faith in both of you.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.333
I have total faith in one of you.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.250
I still think we might need Mark.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.542
(sighs) Not this Mark.

05:36.709 --> 05:40.875
He's back to being the arrogant jerk he
was before we found Mech-X4.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.041
So, if you subtract that...

05:47.333 --> 05:49.875
and, uh, you move the two

05:49.959 --> 05:51.583
to the other side of the equation...

05:51.667 --> 05:53.709
I like it, I like it.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.709
...then, X equals seven.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.583
You just solved a polynomial, son.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.625
You get excited
about the weirdest things.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.041
That's 'cause...

06:03.125 --> 06:05.625
-(HarpPad plays hip-hop melody)
-♪ I am the master of math ♪

06:05.709 --> 06:08.667

06:09.500 --> 06:11.375
I need to find a word
that rhymes with tutoring.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.333
Neutering.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.667
We had a dog.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.917
Seriously, Harris...
thanks for the help.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.417
Is something wrong?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.542
No one's ever
fist-bumped me before.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.041
Awesome!

06:32.709 --> 06:34.166
Either of you dweebs
see my HarpPod?

06:35.291 --> 06:38.041
Okay, boys, I'll be working late tonight,
so, dinner's in the fridge.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.417
Okay, Mom.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.792
-You gotta go.
-What?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.792
Mom's working late,
I'm gonna throw a big party,

06:46.875 --> 06:48.291
and I don't want you lame-os around.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.875
How do you know I'm a lame-o?

06:49.959 --> 06:53.291
-Your tie, your hair, your face--
-I rescind my request.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.500
Ah. Why don't you guys
just go... see a movie?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.834
Go to Hocus Pocus Pizza,
whatever nine-year-olds do.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.208
-Uh...
-I'm 12.

07:02.291 --> 07:05.750
And if you wanna make it
to 13, I'd better not see your face.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.000
We can go to my house.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.041
I can show you my sister's diary--

07:13.125 --> 07:16.166
No! Did she mention me? No!

07:16.250 --> 07:19.041
Just because he's older,
does not mean he gets to do this.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.166
It's my house, too, I'm staying.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.208
And so are you.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.458
Oh, man.

07:25.542 --> 07:29.083
I'm going to my first
high school par-tay.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.917
Good thing I'm always
dressed for a night out.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.500
I can see the diary
another time, right?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.792
-Yeah, of course.
-Oh, cool, cool, cool.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.875
I've planted the red bloom,

07:47.959 --> 07:51.458
and I've created this for Traeger to use
his power to mass produce it.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.542
We could be done by tonight!

07:53.625 --> 07:55.125
Thanks for helping.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.208
Yeah, I'm really more
of a supervisor type.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.667
These are thinking man's hands.

08:00.041 --> 08:02.000
Well done, Harris.

08:02.083 --> 08:06.083
Sparing you seems to have been
a wise decision.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.291
Ew, creepy.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.500
But awesome.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.750
(Traeger) By tonight, I'll have
enough red bloom

08:48.834 --> 08:52.667
to infect and control
every human on the planet.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.625
What about Mech-X4?
What about Ryan?

08:54.709 --> 08:56.458
Don't worry about him.

08:56.542 --> 08:57.375
If he shows up...

08:59.291 --> 09:00.375
he's mine.

09:13.375 --> 09:17.583
Hey! Jet gets FM radio.
Does anybody know what that is?

09:17.667 --> 09:20.458
Camo-mode's up.
Veracity, what are we looking at?

09:20.542 --> 09:25.333
Uh, let's see, growing pods,
refrigeration area...

09:25.417 --> 09:29.250
Ah, bingo. Traeger, Harper,
Morris, Grey, and Harris.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.458
So, four and a half baddies.

09:30.542 --> 09:33.125
-Four and a half?
-Come on. Harris is tiny.

09:34.583 --> 09:35.542
What is that?

09:35.625 --> 09:38.208
The red bloom. These greenhouses
can make a ton of 'em.

09:38.291 --> 09:40.500
What do you say we bring the robot in,

09:40.583 --> 09:42.667
do a little cha-cha-cha
on the greenhouses?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.333
First, we cure Harris,
then we destroy the greenhouses.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.583
-But once we save him...
-Then, we dance.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.750
You got the new antidote?

09:49.834 --> 09:52.333
Uh, I upgraded it
with procatalytic enzyme,

09:52.417 --> 09:54.917
but I can't be sure
it's gonna work without testing it.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.250
We don't have time.
Harris is gonna have to be the test.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.250
Wait for us!

10:02.250 --> 10:03.792
Let's get our little
Hair-bear back.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.250
You know, he really doesn't
like it when you make fun of his size.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.917
Yeah. I know.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.083
(Harris groans)
What are you babbling about?

10:15.166 --> 10:17.250
(Morris) Lucy and I were arguing
over everything.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.875
So I said to her,
I can't live like this anymore.

10:19.959 --> 10:22.625
And that's when I saw
the ad for a janitor with fighting skills.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.750
I'm 14. Why are you telling me
your old man problems?

10:26.834 --> 10:27.667
(groans)

10:32.667 --> 10:34.333
What do you want us--

10:43.250 --> 10:45.583
Hey! Henchman number two.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.834
Yeah, Vin Doofus, we're talking to you!

10:48.917 --> 10:50.542
(growls) Come here!

10:53.166 --> 10:54.208
Hey, buddy!

10:57.417 --> 10:58.333
Hey.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.250
-(grunts)
-Aah!

11:10.417 --> 11:11.417
Aah!

11:12.291 --> 11:14.417
Harris, come on, we're best friends.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.709
No, not anymore.

11:18.375 --> 11:21.083
Is Ryan Peanut Walker gonna cry?

11:21.166 --> 11:22.667
Are you a sad peanut?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.250
(grunting)

11:35.166 --> 11:36.583
Is this supposed to hurt?

11:37.667 --> 11:40.000
I wasn't trying to hurt
Mommy's precious cargo.

11:40.083 --> 11:43.125
Hey! Spyder said he wasn't
gonna tell anyone about that.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.000
-Ryan?
-Harris! Hey, Harris!

11:52.083 --> 11:53.709
Harris! Hey! You okay?

11:53.792 --> 11:55.792
-Ryan...
-Yeah?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.834
-Ryan?
-Yeah?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.959
(Harris echoing) Ryan, wait up.

12:02.667 --> 12:06.500
(dance music playing)

12:10.291 --> 12:12.000
Okay, let's do this!

12:12.083 --> 12:14.709
-You sure?
-There's a party in my house.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.625
I'm not not going
to a party in my house.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.125
That's a double negative.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.959
And yep... yep, son!

12:21.041 --> 12:22.166
Come on!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.792
(shrieking)

12:30.125 --> 12:32.250
Huh? Why is this fun?

12:32.333 --> 12:34.291
I don't know. But it is!

12:34.375 --> 12:35.625
(laughs)

12:35.709 --> 12:37.625
Dude, are those freshmen?

12:37.709 --> 12:41.333
No, that's my little brother
and somebody, but... chill.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.458
I'm already on it.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.375
I call it...

12:45.208 --> 12:46.667
the pain-a-pult.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.667
(chuckles) Awesome!

12:48.750 --> 12:53.375
(panting) Okay. All this being cool
is making me thirsty.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.458
-You want anything?
-No, I'm-- I'm good.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.458
-Okay.
-Woo!

12:59.959 --> 13:03.250
Hey! This is an expensive
piece of hardware!

13:04.041 --> 13:05.792
(mutters) Varsity punks.

13:05.875 --> 13:09.333
(Dane) Awesome. Dude, that's
straight-up sadistic. I'm so proud of you.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.375
As soon as Ryan opens this cabinet...

13:11.458 --> 13:13.333
He'll have egg on his face!

13:15.333 --> 13:17.083
(dance music stops)

13:17.166 --> 13:19.125
-...he'll have egg on his face!
-(music resumes)

13:19.208 --> 13:20.875
-(laughing)
-(Dane) Mark.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.208
Wait until you see my designs
for "The Hurt Locker."

13:23.291 --> 13:25.458
It's a locker that hurts.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.625
He's coming. He's coming.

13:33.291 --> 13:35.083
Nice jumping, bro.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.834
We're out of chips.
Can you grab me some from there?

13:37.917 --> 13:38.834
Yeah.

13:39.875 --> 13:42.125
Ry-- Ryan! It's a trap! No...

13:43.667 --> 13:45.000
-No!
-(grunts)

13:45.500 --> 13:46.792
(grunts)

13:46.875 --> 13:49.792
(others laughing)

13:58.583 --> 14:00.417
-Aw!
-Dude, we totally got that dweeb!

14:00.500 --> 14:03.667
(laughing)

14:03.750 --> 14:06.959
-Ryan...
-Harris.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.166
You really shouldn't
have come here.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.750
Your antidote didn't work.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.667
Traeger has given me
more power than you can imagine.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.875
(groans)

14:24.542 --> 14:27.125
Harris, I'm on your side!

14:27.208 --> 14:28.458
I don't wanna hurt you.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.875
-We're friends.
-I have new friends now.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.125
-Hope you're ready to meet them.
-Harris, please!

14:36.750 --> 14:39.542
(alarm blaring)

14:40.959 --> 14:42.917
(alarm continuing)

14:44.083 --> 14:45.458
(growls)

14:50.542 --> 14:52.917
Okay, we've harvested
the first batch.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.667
It's packed and ready to go.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.333
By the way, I did most
of the heavy lifting.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.959
I need you to remain here

15:01.041 --> 15:04.417
until the rest of the bloom
has reached full maturity.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.333
I can, but you know
Ryan's here, right?

15:07.417 --> 15:09.583
All he's gotta do is have the robot
stomp on this place,

15:09.667 --> 15:10.750
and we are goners.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.083
I mean, we're kind of
defenseless here.

15:13.166 --> 15:16.417
Not in the least.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.041
(grunting)

15:21.959 --> 15:24.333
-You guys took out Morris?
-Who can't?

15:24.417 --> 15:27.625
-Hey, I'm right here.
-Yeah, we know.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.917
(grumbles)

15:29.542 --> 15:32.542
-Harris?
-The cure didn't work.

15:32.625 --> 15:35.375
They've already
filled this container with red bloom.

15:37.542 --> 15:39.333
Here comes some more.
Guys, we need the bot.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.333
Bye-bye, red bloom.

16:15.834 --> 16:16.792
How you feeling?

16:16.875 --> 16:19.000
It hurts like crazy
when I sneeze, but...

16:19.583 --> 16:22.583
-I'll be okay.
-Sorry about Mark.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.083
He was just trying to impress
his varsity friends,

16:25.166 --> 16:27.000
and he doesn't think
about who might get hurt.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.834
You took that bullet for me, man.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.417
You were in trouble.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.083
I tried to help.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.750
That's what tutors do.

16:36.834 --> 16:40.583
No, that's...
that's what friends do.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.291
And if you're ever in trouble,

16:42.375 --> 16:44.500
no matter what's going on,
I'll have your back.

16:45.542 --> 16:48.291
From now on, we stick together.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.667
So we'll be... covariants?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.959
Weirdly put, but yeah, I guess so.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.458
-Yo, Spyder.
-Hey, Spyder.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.750
Oh, what up?

17:01.834 --> 17:03.208
(both) You know that kid?

17:03.291 --> 17:05.041
(both) Jinx! Jinx again!

17:24.959 --> 17:26.542
I can't do it.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.917
It's Harris, I just... I just can't.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.000
I knew you were too weak.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.041
(grunting)

17:44.500 --> 17:46.125
(roaring)

17:46.208 --> 17:48.834
Okay, no more short jokes.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.291
He can turn into a monster now?

17:50.375 --> 17:52.583
(roaring)

18:05.250 --> 18:08.083
Veracity, we need the anti-ooze
X-weapon, but dial it down.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.041
-We don't wanna kill him.
-On it, give me a few.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.208
(roaring)

18:20.917 --> 18:22.959
Where'd he go?
V, can you track him?

18:23.041 --> 18:25.041
Yeah, I am working
on the X-weapon.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.166
I can't be in two places at once.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.959
-Spyder, you see him?
-Yeah! Yeah, got him!

18:29.041 --> 18:30.000
Uh... no.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.667
That is, uh, just frozen yogurt.

18:32.750 --> 18:36.208
(rumbling)

18:45.041 --> 18:47.291
(roaring)

18:49.500 --> 18:52.333
(grunting)

18:55.458 --> 18:57.500
He just took out the X-weapon.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.000
It's the only weapon we have to take down
a monster of red ooze!

19:00.083 --> 19:02.500
(gasping) I can't... breathe.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.625
-The shields!
-Hang on! Switching to shields!

19:23.166 --> 19:25.166
(roars)

19:31.291 --> 19:32.166
Everybody okay?

19:34.875 --> 19:36.208
We gotta get back out there.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.041
I can't move the robot.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.834
We've got damage icons
all over the place.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.083
It's gonna take me
a few hours to get us moving again.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.917
You know, Mark could've...

19:51.417 --> 19:53.250
not finished this sentence.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.750
Good call.

19:54.834 --> 19:55.667
(groans)

20:12.709 --> 20:14.500
(Veracity) Not picking up
any life signs.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.750
-Nobody's home.
-What about the red bloom?

20:16.834 --> 20:17.750
Gone, man.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.041
All of it.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.875
We need to figure out
where they took the bloom and Harris.

20:22.959 --> 20:27.041
Ryan? They didn't take Harris.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.625
He went with them.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.417
He's one of them now.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.458
What are you saying?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.750
The next time
that we battle the bad guys,

20:37.834 --> 20:41.750
you have to choose
between saving Harris...

20:44.083 --> 20:45.333
and saving the world.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Man, it's a long way from the ferry.
I miss Mark's car.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.000
-You gotta let it go, dude--
-No, no, I'm not--

21:04.083 --> 21:06.250
Wait. What's that?

21:06.959 --> 21:11.333
(missiles whistling, exploding)

21:11.417 --> 21:14.291
The red bloom, they're spreading them
over the whole city.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.834
Spyder, bounce belt. Now!

21:21.625 --> 21:24.166
(people screaming)

21:24.250 --> 21:26.333
-(screams)
-(grunts)

21:26.417 --> 21:27.834
(car alarms blaring)

21:37.834 --> 21:39.709
(Traeger) Find Ryan Walker.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.667
Eliminate him.

21:42.208 --> 21:45.125
Destroy Mech-X4!

21:47.792 --> 21:51.208
(theme music playing)
