00:13.689 --> 00:16.503
- Do you have to film everything?
- Yup.

00:16.603 --> 00:18.894
Describing... you're filming
everything, you're describing....

00:18.994 --> 00:21.763
That's his journal.
I want him to remember everything.

00:21.863 --> 00:25.233
His journal. You don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl yet.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.436
Yeah. But, you know...

00:27.536 --> 00:31.272
...we trust the first ultrason, it's a boy.

00:31.372 --> 00:33.008
So tell us.

00:33.108 --> 00:34.643
- Where are we going?
- Yup.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.678
We're going to the hospital...

00:37.778 --> 00:42.017
...to get our second ultrason
and confirm the sex of the baby.

00:42.117 --> 00:44.419
- This little guy.
- Yeah, little guy.

00:44.519 --> 00:47.769
And we're happy, we're excited.

00:48.689 --> 00:50.225
Hi.

00:50.325 --> 00:52.894
Hi. You're gonna be editing all this, right?

00:52.994 --> 00:55.263
- Of course.
- All right, so your turn now.

00:55.363 --> 00:57.298
Tell me how you feel, future dad.

00:57.398 --> 01:02.437
I'm just really grateful
that our kid is gonna be healthy.

01:02.537 --> 01:04.355
Matt! Watch out!

01:07.675 --> 01:09.510
Oh, my God!

01:09.982 --> 01:13.048
- Jess! Jess! Oh, my God!
- Matt!

01:13.148 --> 01:15.026
Oh, my God!

01:15.126 --> 01:19.337
You got the phone? Where's the phone?
Call 911! Oh, my God!

01:22.224 --> 01:24.108
Oh, my baby.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.121
- <i>You're gonna be editing all this, right?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

02:30.324 --> 02:34.295
I hate night shifts. Did your boss say
how much he's charging us for the weekend?

02:34.395 --> 02:38.487
Free. Yeah, we have the cabin to
ourselves for the entire weekend.

02:38.587 --> 02:40.902
Yeah. He want us to have a good
time before I get back to work.

02:41.002 --> 02:44.704
That's nice. I can't believe
we're leaving for a whole weekend.

02:44.804 --> 02:46.223
It's been so long.

02:46.323 --> 02:49.174
I want us to have fun and laugh and party.

02:49.274 --> 02:51.256
- Party.
- And be ourselves again.

02:51.356 --> 02:53.915
Yeah. You didn't tell
anyone about this, did you?

02:54.015 --> 02:55.383
- No. Why?
- Okay.

02:55.483 --> 02:58.486
'Cause I want to make a little
surprise video for Joe's birthday.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.089
You gonna have enough time
to put it together before we leave?

03:01.189 --> 03:04.259
- Yeah, if I work all night on it.
- Okay, well, don't work too hard...

03:04.359 --> 03:06.895
...'cause I need you to have
your energy this weekend.

03:06.995 --> 03:11.667
I got the news from Joe. All is in order,
we can start trying to have a baby again.

03:11.767 --> 03:15.843
Okay? So, I need you to have your energy,
all of your energy. I gotta go to work.

03:15.943 --> 03:17.506
Bye.

03:18.206 --> 03:21.109
Oh, don't forget,
you're picking us up at 11:00, okay?

03:21.209 --> 03:23.210
- Okay.
- Love you!

03:23.310 --> 03:25.128
Love you!

04:41.656 --> 04:46.728
<i>Good morning, you're listening to
the morning show with me, Dan Hitchcock.</i>

04:46.828 --> 04:50.673
<i>Okay, the weather. Now, temperatures
will today move into the low 80s...</i>

04:50.773 --> 04:54.135
<i>...and we'll have sunshine
and a few clouds for most of the day.</i>

04:54.235 --> 04:56.671
<i>With wind from 10 to 20 miles an hour.</i>

04:56.771 --> 05:00.462
<i>Now, as for the long weekend ahead, well...</i>

05:00.562 --> 05:05.313
<i>...sunny with a few clouds and temperatures
are going to move down into the lower 70s.</i>

05:05.413 --> 05:08.583
<i>But still, a perfect weekend to get away.</i>

05:08.683 --> 05:11.953
<i>Now, after the break,
we'll talk about why there's a...</i>

05:12.553 --> 05:16.773
<i>...you should be taking an evening
stroll over the long weekend.</i>

05:18.922 --> 05:21.547
<i>Earlier this morning an American
satellite was destroyed...</i>

05:21.647 --> 05:25.400
<i>...by what authorities are calling
an unidentified object.</i>

05:25.500 --> 05:28.825
<i>Images taken by the satellite itself
moments before it was destroyed...</i>

05:28.925 --> 05:33.992
<i>...seem to indicate that a collision between
the satellite and the object was the cause.</i>

05:34.092 --> 05:36.144
<i>Mainly over the province of Quebec, Canada...</i>

05:36.244 --> 05:38.747
Ready, Teddy? All right, let's go!
We're running late, buddy.

05:38.847 --> 05:41.925
<i>...to report any unusual sightings.</i>

05:52.927 --> 05:54.262
- Hey, Joe!
- <i>You're late Matt.</i>

05:54.362 --> 05:57.265
- I know, it's Teddy's fault.
- <i>I think he disagrees with you.</i>

05:57.365 --> 05:59.701
- I'll be there in a minute.
- <i>Yeah, right.</i>

05:59.801 --> 06:01.736
What's up, birthday boy?

06:01.836 --> 06:04.572
A weekend away from the hospital,
that's what's up.

06:04.672 --> 06:07.597
- Keep your eyes on the road, man.
- Nice haircut, doc.

06:07.697 --> 06:09.243
I hate it!

06:09.343 --> 06:12.813
When we get back to the hospital,
I'm gonna show you something real sweet.

06:12.913 --> 06:15.216
- Check it out! Hold on, hold on.
- What is it?

06:15.316 --> 06:17.151
Come on, what is it?

06:18.237 --> 06:19.554
- Check it out!
- Holy shit!

06:19.654 --> 06:21.389
- Yeah, baby.
- No way!

06:21.489 --> 06:23.324
Are you kidding me? You finally bought it?

06:23.424 --> 06:26.795
It costs me a small fortune, but I got
everything I wanted. I got lights...

06:26.895 --> 06:29.638
...for the night shots, I got everything man.

06:29.738 --> 06:32.401
Check it out! Is it recording right now?

06:32.501 --> 06:36.536
Yup. Matt, I'm telling you,
I'm ready for any eventuality now.

06:36.905 --> 06:38.785
Hold on.

06:39.428 --> 06:40.682
Hi, honey!

06:40.782 --> 06:43.979
Who's the girl your brother's bringing, Jess?
His new girlfriend?

06:44.079 --> 06:46.581
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know much about her.

06:46.681 --> 06:50.017
- She's going to school with him.
- Wait.

06:50.117 --> 06:51.886
Are you gonna film like that on the weekend?

06:51.986 --> 06:55.590
- I'm just trying to make a souvenir here.
- Of my ass?

06:55.690 --> 06:57.625
You know your nurse outfit excites me.

06:57.725 --> 07:00.295
You know you're not bringing
that thing into the bedroom.

07:00.395 --> 07:01.696
Come on!

07:01.796 --> 07:04.432
Where's your brother?
Did you tell him to meet us here?

07:04.532 --> 07:06.902
- Yeah, I did.
- Your brother is a mess.

07:07.002 --> 07:09.871
What? Is that Trey and his new girlfriend?

07:09.971 --> 07:12.641
What do you think you're doing? Give me that.

07:12.741 --> 07:15.376
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Jess.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.212
- Julia.
- This is my husband Matt.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.014
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:20.114 --> 07:22.590
- What up, Trey?
- What's up, Matt?

07:22.690 --> 07:25.503
- Hey, nice to see you, Joe.
- Yeah, it's been a while.

07:25.603 --> 07:27.988
Stop, my God.

07:28.088 --> 07:30.608
Matt, how long will it take us to get there?

07:30.708 --> 07:32.627
Gracefield is about five hours.

07:32.727 --> 07:34.796
Five hours?
I thought it was closer than that!

07:34.896 --> 07:38.616
Five hours? You know what?
Just wake me up when we get there, Tron.

07:38.716 --> 07:41.235
Why are you calling him like that?

07:41.335 --> 07:43.992
He called him that because
Matt's a video game editor.

07:44.092 --> 07:46.507
- Okay.
- That's not really why.

07:46.607 --> 07:49.531
- Come on, show it to her, Tron.
- Trey! He's driving.

07:49.631 --> 07:51.979
Come on, man. You can't see anything...

07:52.079 --> 07:56.177
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.
- She'll like it, man. I'm telling you.

07:56.277 --> 07:58.787
- Don't do it, Matt.
- You really want to see it?

07:58.887 --> 08:02.289
You really want to see it?
All right, all right, I'm doing it.

08:02.389 --> 08:04.659
- You know, Trey, this is all your fault.
- What is it?

08:04.759 --> 08:08.545
I'm filming this. I got this. Oh, God!

08:11.631 --> 08:13.502
Oh, my God!

08:13.602 --> 08:16.751
- This is disgusting!
- She dropped it in the trunk.

08:16.851 --> 08:19.307
What? What? What's going on?

08:19.407 --> 08:21.910
- Shit!
- Teddy's licking it.

08:22.010 --> 08:25.012
What? What do you mean she dropped my eye?

08:25.312 --> 08:27.181
Teddy's licking it.

08:27.744 --> 08:31.434
- Oh, man!
- Matt's prosthetic eye.

08:33.922 --> 08:35.807
Trey, can I have it back, now?

08:38.659 --> 08:40.977
Teddy, don't swallow it!

09:01.449 --> 09:03.851
Yo, does anyone have any reception?

09:03.951 --> 09:05.353
- Nope!
- Negative.

09:05.453 --> 09:07.682
- I lost reception like an hour ago.
- Me too.

09:07.782 --> 09:10.879
God, Matt. Why is it taking so long?
Are you lost?

09:10.979 --> 09:14.232
No. I'm not lost. We'll be there soon, okay?

09:14.332 --> 09:15.365
Relax.

09:15.465 --> 09:17.833
- Matt, whose cabin is this, by the way?
- My boss.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.002
Please ask him why he
bought a cabin that far.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.371
- 'Cause he traps, Trey.
- He what?

09:23.571 --> 09:25.843
He's a trapper. He captures animals.

09:25.943 --> 09:29.836
No, no, Matt, tell him the real reason
why your boss bought a cabin out here.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.447
- That's a good story.
- Why?

09:32.547 --> 09:35.765
'Cause my boss has been trying
to capture Bigfoot.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.586
- What did he just say?
- Sasquatch!

09:38.686 --> 09:43.241
- Your boss is a kooky little man.
- It's a hoax, that's what it is. But it's cool.

09:43.341 --> 09:46.294
You'd be surprise how many people
believe in that shit. And he does.

09:46.394 --> 09:49.033
- And he's been trying to capture it.
- Nobody believes in that stuff.

09:49.133 --> 09:53.034
- Your boss, man, he freaks me out.
- Hey, guys, I think we're here.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.405
- Finally!
- What kind of cabin has a gate like this?

09:57.505 --> 10:00.841
I was expecting a shack
with one room and no toilet.

10:00.941 --> 10:03.644
Well, if it's true, I'm sleeping in the car.

10:03.744 --> 10:06.547
- Come on, Liz!
- Shotgun!

10:06.647 --> 10:10.151
- "No trespassing"?
- Are we sure this is it?

10:10.251 --> 10:15.389
I hope so. 'Cause if it's not,
we're definitely lost.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.231
That's reassuring.

10:17.331 --> 10:20.762
- Did he say we were lost?
- Yeah, probably.

10:20.862 --> 10:24.733
Matt, you do realize how crazy your
boss is for believing in this shit, right?

10:24.925 --> 10:28.036
- Yeah, you got that right.
- A Bigfoot, come on!

10:28.136 --> 10:30.872
Yeah, man, he even told me
he heard one a while back.

10:30.972 --> 10:36.033
Yeah, your boss is definitely
out of his mind. And paranoid too!

10:36.133 --> 10:39.681
So, Julia and I are getting
the biggest room, that's just for sure.

10:39.781 --> 10:42.817
- You guys are getting the couch.
- No way, man! Are you serious?

10:42.917 --> 10:44.899
Hell yeah, I am.

10:44.999 --> 10:48.789
- Man, I'm not getting the couch.
- Yo! Guys! Check this out!

10:48.889 --> 10:51.458
That is sick!

10:51.558 --> 10:53.991
This place looks amazing!

10:54.091 --> 10:57.832
- Yeah. You're still getting the couch, Trey.
- That's bullshit. Come on! Don't do that.

10:57.932 --> 10:59.996
Trey, you're so getting the couch.

11:00.096 --> 11:02.095
- No, no, no.
- No, I'm gonna go there before you.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.172
'Cause you're the youngest,
that's why you get the couch.

11:04.272 --> 11:07.674
- Matt, why are you locking the doors?
- Give a head start to my wife.

11:07.774 --> 11:10.478
- What?
- Ready? Go, go, go!

11:10.578 --> 11:13.815
- Grab the best room!
- Go, go, go. Go, Liz! Go, go, go.

11:13.915 --> 11:17.115
- That's not cool, Matt, come on!
- Hey, slow down!

11:17.215 --> 11:20.021
Looks like you got the couch to me, Trey.

11:20.621 --> 11:22.623
Go, go, go, go, go.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.958
Catch up, Teddy, come on!

11:25.558 --> 11:28.499
- This place is huge!
- Bring you ass, quick!

11:28.599 --> 11:33.968
Holy shit! Look at this place.
This is unbelievable.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.771
What's wrong with this guy?
There's a surveillance room.

11:36.871 --> 11:39.674
- Matt, I got it!
- Jess, where are you?

11:39.774 --> 11:41.379
- Right here.
- Right where?

11:41.479 --> 11:42.977
Upstairs.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.647
No, no, two separate beds? Definitely not.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.983
You guys are too young
to sleep together anyway.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.287
Yeah, yeah, really funny, Matt.
You should be a comedian.

11:52.387 --> 11:54.488
We need a double bed.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.105
Jess?

11:59.288 --> 12:00.728
Tell me this is our room.

12:00.828 --> 12:03.297
Hey, Trey, how's the couch?

12:03.397 --> 12:05.248
Shut up, man.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.650
Oh, shit!

12:09.569 --> 12:11.939
You have to stop doing that.

12:12.039 --> 12:15.209
- You want me to stop doing... that?
- No, no.

12:15.309 --> 12:18.913
- That, you can keep doing all weekend.
- Yeah? You like that?

12:19.013 --> 12:22.383
Yeah. I've been waiting
for this weekend for a long time.

12:22.483 --> 12:26.394
- I know, me too. It's gonna be nice.
- Guys! Guys! Come outside!

12:26.494 --> 12:28.689
Hey, Joe? Heads up.

12:28.789 --> 12:33.009
- Guys, check this out.
- There's a hot tub. Yes!

12:35.629 --> 12:37.131
Crazy.

12:37.231 --> 12:40.635
- It doesn't get any better than this.
- I think I can die now.

12:41.535 --> 12:43.671
Man, I'm telling you,
this is exactly what I needed.

12:43.771 --> 12:46.674
No worries, eating, drinking, and...

12:46.774 --> 12:48.143
And what?

12:48.243 --> 12:51.289
- And eating again, baby. Just eating again.
- Like the sound of that.

12:51.389 --> 12:53.781
- Yeah.
- No cameras allowed, tough.

12:53.881 --> 12:55.333
Dinner's ready.

12:55.799 --> 12:57.952
Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

12:58.052 --> 12:59.587
Thanks, babe.

12:59.687 --> 13:03.539
To an amazing weekend with my best friends!

13:04.759 --> 13:06.293
Cheers!

13:06.693 --> 13:08.763
- I'm getting drunk.
- Cheers, love.

13:08.863 --> 13:11.948
- It's yours, right there. Ready?
- Come on, Matt.

13:15.123 --> 13:18.139
Way to go, way to go!
Come on, buddy, drink it. Drink it.

13:18.239 --> 13:20.641
Chug, chug, chug!

13:20.741 --> 13:22.959
Chug, chug, chug...

13:29.115 --> 13:32.519
And there we have Jess,
the luckiest poker player in Gracefield.

13:32.619 --> 13:37.273
- She's always winning.
- And here's my wife and her sexy poker face.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.677
Oh, what a lucky bastard.

13:43.013 --> 13:45.595
- That's how they study biology today.
- At least he got the couch.

13:45.695 --> 13:46.941
Leave him alone.

13:47.041 --> 13:52.940
Julia. Julia? Come on in, baby,
the water's so good. And, well...

13:53.040 --> 13:55.646
- You know, I have a surprise.
- Really?

13:55.746 --> 13:58.579
- All right, all right, I'm coming.
- Trey, your sister is gonna come out.

13:58.679 --> 14:02.683
- Joe! Who cares?
- Sorry, but I'm not getting my bathing suit.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.852
Don't be sorry.

14:04.952 --> 14:08.822
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Is she for real?

14:09.369 --> 14:11.025
What? I mean, I didn't...

14:11.125 --> 14:13.515
- Look.
- What?

14:13.615 --> 14:15.863
- What is that?
- What is what?

14:15.963 --> 14:17.547
That!

14:18.566 --> 14:19.901
Guys, are you seeing this?

14:20.001 --> 14:22.303
- Yeah.
- What is it?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.605
This thing is getting bigger and bigger.

14:25.350 --> 14:29.392
- Yo, what is that?
- It's coming straight at us!

14:30.277 --> 14:32.146
Watch out!

14:32.584 --> 14:35.249
- Oh, my God!
- Shit.

14:35.349 --> 14:37.218
- Are you all right?
- Did you feel that?

14:37.318 --> 14:40.021
It crashed right behind the house.
Guys, are you all right?

14:40.121 --> 14:42.856
- Fine!
- Jess, are you okay?

14:42.956 --> 14:45.893
- Joe, grab your camera!
- Yeah, I'll meet you in the front.

14:45.993 --> 14:47.695
No, guys, no. Matt, no!

14:47.795 --> 14:50.445
- We'll be right back!
- Wait up!

14:51.799 --> 14:53.567
This is so cool!

14:53.667 --> 14:55.578
This is insane!

14:55.678 --> 14:58.375
- I'm so glad I brought the light.
- This is unreal.

14:58.475 --> 15:01.108
Make sure you record everything
because nobody is gonna believe us.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.445
Yeah, I got this. Hold on.
Let me just set up here.

15:04.545 --> 15:07.275
- I'm recording with my camera too.
- What camera?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.582
Never mind, never mind.

15:08.682 --> 15:11.018
That's what the red light
in your eye is all about, isn't it?

15:11.118 --> 15:14.722
- No. No, it's not. Come on, let's go!
- Guys, where are you? Yo, where is it?

15:14.822 --> 15:17.858
- Where is it? I wanna see it!
- Just put some clothes on!

15:17.958 --> 15:20.694
- Let's go, he's drunk.
- Wait, wait, where are we going?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.998
You stay here, all right? Get you clothes on
and make sure you don't lose sight of us.

15:24.098 --> 15:26.233
Let's go, man! He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.470
- I wanna go with you guys!
- It has to be somewhere close.

15:29.570 --> 15:31.405
Yeah, we should see lights
or something, right?

15:31.505 --> 15:33.774
Talk about a satellite
that was destroyed this morning.

15:33.874 --> 15:38.312
- You think this could be a part of it?
- Maybe. We should found out pretty soon.

15:38.412 --> 15:41.316
They said they were expecting
some debris to fall back to Earth.

15:41.416 --> 15:44.500
Best birthday weekend ever!

15:45.419 --> 15:47.467
Which way do you want to go?

15:47.567 --> 15:50.057
Let's try this way. Follow me.

15:51.957 --> 15:55.429
Watch you steps. My boss might have
set some traps around here.

15:55.529 --> 16:00.416
Seriously? Your boss and his hunt
for Bigfoot? That's pretty sick, too.

16:05.905 --> 16:07.942
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- What?

16:08.042 --> 16:11.126
Where is Trey? Trey?

16:14.514 --> 16:16.051
Trey?

16:16.851 --> 16:20.287
- Why doesn't he answer?
- Yo, Matt, we went way too far.

16:20.387 --> 16:21.971
Trey?

16:26.890 --> 16:29.063
Trey? Trey?

16:29.163 --> 16:32.767
- Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.
- What's wrong with you? Answer us.

16:32.867 --> 16:37.404
- Joe, you know what? You stay here, I'm...
- Hold on, hold on. What are you saying?

16:37.504 --> 16:41.742
You stay here, I'm gonna go check it out
further in. It has to be somewhere.

16:41.842 --> 16:45.079
- Keep your light on so I can see you.
- Just don't go too deep.

16:45.179 --> 16:48.683
- We have to find this thing.
- Just don't go too far. All right, Matt?

16:48.783 --> 16:50.333
Yeah.

17:03.830 --> 17:06.867
What was that? What was that?

17:07.267 --> 17:11.204
Oh, come on. Matt! Matt, come on!

17:11.305 --> 17:15.642
Look, man. I can't see you anymore.
You should backtrack, come on!

17:15.742 --> 17:19.365
- We'll come back tomorrow.
- Hold on, just a little bit more.

17:24.951 --> 17:26.787
Oh, my God!

17:27.387 --> 17:29.857
Joe! I see something!

17:29.957 --> 17:33.194
There's a light,
about 50 feet in front of me.

17:33.294 --> 17:35.529
Hold on. Hold on.

17:35.629 --> 17:38.999
Trey! Trey! Are you there?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.435
Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.

17:41.535 --> 17:45.072
- Matt thinks he's got it.
- Really? No way!

17:45.172 --> 17:48.676
No, no, listen to me.
You stay there, I'm gonna go check it out.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.744
Are you kidding me, Joe?

17:50.844 --> 17:52.713
Holy shit!

17:53.613 --> 17:56.699
- Joe, I found it!
- Really?

17:58.885 --> 18:00.721
I'm coming!

18:01.921 --> 18:04.257
Oh, my God.

18:04.357 --> 18:07.194
- Matt, where are you?
- Hurry up, Joe!

18:07.294 --> 18:09.663
You won't believe this!

18:09.763 --> 18:13.249
- Keep talking. Where are you?
- Right here. Right here, Joe.

18:18.971 --> 18:22.809
I told you! I told you
we were gonna find this thing.

18:22.909 --> 18:26.180
Oh, what... what is this?

18:26.580 --> 18:28.664
Look at the size of it!

18:30.716 --> 18:34.388
- Can you see what it is?
- No, it's too deep.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.628
- It's really down there.
- Really?

18:36.728 --> 18:40.828
- Yeah, hold on. Let me try to get it.
- What? You don't know what's in there.

18:40.928 --> 18:43.378
Stop it. You're such a pussy.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.918
It's kind of cold.

18:49.802 --> 18:51.705
I feel something.

18:51.805 --> 18:54.241
What are you doing? Why are you backing up?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.444
I don't know,
you said you felt something, I...

18:56.544 --> 19:00.363
Come on, you're scaring me.
Give me some light. Come on, Joe!

19:09.288 --> 19:11.140
I think I got it.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.645
It's pretty big too.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.241
Holy shit!

19:28.441 --> 19:31.397
- I've never seen anything like it!
- Look at this, man!

19:31.497 --> 19:34.182
- What the hell is it?
- Looks like some kind of meteorite.

19:34.282 --> 19:37.301
That has nothing to do
with the satellite. Is it hot?

19:37.401 --> 19:39.286
No, it's freezing.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.056
- Is it heavy?
- Do you want to hold it?

19:42.656 --> 19:44.458
- No.
- Why are you scared?

19:44.558 --> 19:46.627
No, it's all right.
I just don't want to touch it.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.863
Come on, Joe. It's a rock. It's like lava.

19:48.963 --> 19:51.031
Holy shit!

19:51.131 --> 19:54.120
Hey! What are you doing here? We told you...

19:54.220 --> 19:55.469
You gotta let me touch it.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.005
What the hell is wrong with you?
You have amnesia?

19:58.105 --> 20:01.643
You're not the one standing alone in the
dark. I was freezing my balls out there.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.912
How are we gonna get back to the cabin now?

20:04.012 --> 20:07.922
Relax, it's okay, the house
is like right... there. Oh, shit.

20:08.022 --> 20:10.851
- Yeah. Right, where?
- It was more or less right there.

20:10.951 --> 20:14.088
- What were you thinking, Trey?
- The house moved, jackass.

20:14.188 --> 20:16.256
What a stupid move!

20:16.356 --> 20:19.093
- Come on, let's try this way.
- I'm sure it's that way, okay?

20:19.193 --> 20:21.187
Yeah, you better be right.

20:22.495 --> 20:24.031
Jess!

20:24.131 --> 20:25.681
Liz!

20:30.403 --> 20:32.372
We're definitely close, I can feel it.

20:32.472 --> 20:35.576
Shit! I think I dropped my phone out there.

20:35.676 --> 20:39.346
- Sorry, but we're not going back.
- Oh, shit.

20:39.946 --> 20:43.049
- Guys, guys. Stop, stop, stop.
- What? What is it?

20:43.149 --> 20:46.052
You know what?
I think we should just wait here.

20:46.152 --> 20:49.212
I mean, we don't wanna go too deep.
I'm sure in a few minutes...

20:49.312 --> 20:52.235
- ...the girls gonna come and look for us, right?
- Yeah, you're probably right.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.929
'Cause if we're going in the wrong direction
we are not gonna hear the girls yelling.

20:55.029 --> 20:58.914
- Exactly. So, let's wait here.
- Yeah.

21:00.499 --> 21:02.051
Liz!

21:06.405 --> 21:07.674
What was that, Matt?

21:07.774 --> 21:10.810
- What the hell was that?
- Dude, I don't know.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.362
I heard something...

21:17.249 --> 21:19.068
You guys see anything?

21:19.752 --> 21:21.655
I can't see anything.

21:21.755 --> 21:24.406
What kind of animal sounds like that?

21:26.559 --> 21:29.378
- Matt!
- Jess!

21:29.896 --> 21:31.565
I think it was Jess.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.316
That scream didn't sound like Jess to me!

21:35.101 --> 21:37.471
- Joe. Joe!
- What?

21:37.571 --> 21:39.821
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Matt, no!

21:39.921 --> 21:43.477
- Give me your camera, I'll use the light.
- Just stick to the plan and stay here.

21:43.577 --> 21:45.980
I think the girls are looking for us.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.048
I'll be right back. You guys stay here, okay?

21:48.148 --> 21:51.585
Come on! Are you out of your mind?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.937
Let's just wait here. Matt! Matt!

22:11.070 --> 22:12.588
Jess!

22:29.889 --> 22:31.907
No, no, stay on!

22:55.080 --> 22:58.317
Matt! What happened?

22:58.417 --> 22:59.986
- Matt!
- Joe!

23:00.086 --> 23:02.189
Trey, follow me. Come on.
Matt, where are you?

23:02.289 --> 23:04.157
I need some help!

23:04.257 --> 23:06.234
- Matt!
- Joe, over here.

23:06.334 --> 23:09.696
- Holy shit, what happened?
- I got caught in one of his frickin' traps.

23:09.796 --> 23:12.598
- Hold on, hold on, hold on. Trey?
- Right here.

23:12.698 --> 23:14.392
Matt? What was it?

23:14.492 --> 23:17.952
I didn't see it but it got really close
to me. It was walking all around me.

23:18.052 --> 23:20.640
- What was walking around?
- It was probably hungry or something.

23:20.740 --> 23:24.662
What? Hungry? What the hell
are we dealing with here?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.322
Listen!

23:28.582 --> 23:30.884
- What?
- Listen.

23:30.984 --> 23:32.567
What?

23:37.824 --> 23:39.626
It sounds like my dog.

23:40.026 --> 23:42.878
- Teddy!
- Matt, that wasn't Teddy!

23:44.864 --> 23:46.622
Ted!

23:48.067 --> 23:49.918
Get over here, Teddy!

23:51.237 --> 23:53.455
Sounds like he's hurt.

23:55.408 --> 23:56.763
Shit.

23:56.863 --> 24:00.230
- Trey, hold this. Hold this.
- What? What are you doing?

24:00.330 --> 24:02.140
- Joe, we're gonna go get him.
- Get him?

24:02.240 --> 24:05.118
What? You gotta be kidding me.
What about that sound we just heard?

24:05.218 --> 24:07.220
Every noise gets amplified,
we're in the woods.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.890
You want me to believe that that shit we
just heard was some kind of little squirrel?

24:10.990 --> 24:13.650
You want me to leave Teddy here?
He might get struck in one of those traps.

24:13.750 --> 24:17.364
- You stay here. Joe, come with me.
- Matt, where are we going?

24:17.464 --> 24:19.800
- Keep shining the light.
- Matt, you gotta slow down.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.735
- Teddy!
- You gotta slow down.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.604
- Teddy, where are you?
- Matt, slow down!

24:24.704 --> 24:27.189
Matt! I can't keep up with you.

24:28.407 --> 24:30.292
Holy shit!

24:31.410 --> 24:34.448
- No way, he's not in there!
- Teddy!

24:34.848 --> 24:38.668
- Why the hell did he go in there?
- I'm not sure I wanna find out.

24:41.587 --> 24:43.106
Teddy!

24:47.761 --> 24:49.645
What's wrong with him?

24:50.663 --> 24:54.000
- He sounds scared.
- Scared of what?

24:54.100 --> 24:55.951
I don't know.

24:56.902 --> 24:59.718
- Where are you going?
- I'm going in.

24:59.818 --> 25:03.473
- I'm not going in there.
- Hey, I'm not leaving Teddy here. Okay?

25:03.573 --> 25:06.179
You brought that camera
and that light here for something.

25:06.279 --> 25:08.515
Oh, great, now the night vision's on.

25:09.315 --> 25:11.199
Are you coming?

25:12.217 --> 25:13.736
Teddy!

25:24.130 --> 25:26.148
It sounds like he's crying.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.018
Dogs don't cry like that.

25:30.903 --> 25:32.972
Matt, let's go!

25:33.772 --> 25:35.324
What?

25:45.384 --> 25:46.902
Teddy?

25:56.629 --> 25:58.147
Teddy!

26:00.967 --> 26:03.585
Matt, hold on. What is that?

26:17.850 --> 26:19.735
Matt, I say we go.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.410
- Hold on.
- Let's go!

26:29.728 --> 26:31.246
Teddy!

26:48.214 --> 26:50.065
What is that?

26:51.917 --> 26:53.768
What is that?

26:54.220 --> 26:56.104
What the hell is this?

26:58.624 --> 27:00.475
What is it?

27:01.394 --> 27:04.163
- It's Trey's cell phone.
- What?

27:04.263 --> 27:06.348
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's his.

27:10.569 --> 27:13.622
- How the hell did it get here?
- Oh, my God.

27:20.460 --> 27:21.964
Shit!

27:43.536 --> 27:45.353
Oh, shit!

27:45.906 --> 27:47.790
Go, go, go!

27:51.276 --> 27:53.161
Come, come, come.

27:53.612 --> 27:55.464
What was that?

28:15.100 --> 28:17.986
We gotta go. We gotta go!

28:20.038 --> 28:22.909
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:23.209 --> 28:25.494
- Is it gone?
- Can you see it? Can you see it?

28:25.594 --> 28:27.162
No.

28:28.013 --> 28:29.883
I think it's safe to go.

28:29.983 --> 28:31.834
Let's go.

28:49.101 --> 28:51.920
Joe! Joe, what are you doing?

28:52.971 --> 28:55.023
Come on, let's go!

29:06.819 --> 29:08.637
Don't move.

29:45.058 --> 29:47.661
- Is it following us?
- I don't know.

29:47.761 --> 29:50.178
Keep going. Keep going.

29:52.931 --> 29:55.383
- Joe!
- Wait, wait, wait.

29:58.270 --> 30:00.306
Matt! We're here!

30:00.406 --> 30:01.939
- Julia?
- It's the girls.

30:02.039 --> 30:04.995
- Joe, are you okay?
- Joe, Joe, hey!

30:05.095 --> 30:06.136
Julia?

30:06.236 --> 30:09.883
Don't say anything to the girls. You have
to stay calm, we don't want them to panic.

30:09.983 --> 30:12.085
- Okay, sure, whatever.
- Joe, are you okay?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.687
- Over here!
- Wait, wait, wait.

30:13.787 --> 30:16.587
- Where have you been?
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop screaming!

30:16.687 --> 30:19.059
- What?
- Are you all right?

30:19.159 --> 30:21.228
I think I just shit my pants.

30:21.328 --> 30:23.897
- Trey, Trey, hold on.
- Yeah, yeah, he's good.

30:23.997 --> 30:25.932
- Did you guys find it?
- Yeah, we did.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.001
But we should probably
get back to the cabin now.

30:28.101 --> 30:29.836
- Why?
- I'm not staying here.

30:29.936 --> 30:32.344
- What's going on?
- There's something in the woods.

30:32.444 --> 30:35.709
- Like an animal? What's...
- We're in the woods, what did you expect?

30:35.809 --> 30:37.931
Yeah, but don't worry.

30:38.031 --> 30:41.463
- It was just a little scream.
- Yeah, Bigfoot in a cave.

30:42.415 --> 30:44.518
- Is this a joke?
- No, this is serious.

30:44.618 --> 30:47.220
We gotta get our stuff,
we gotta pack up and leave now.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.189
We're leaving tonight? We just got here.

30:49.289 --> 30:52.312
- It's safer not to hit the road tonight.
- Matt, what are you talking about?

30:52.412 --> 30:55.009
Everybody stay in the cabin.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

30:55.129 --> 30:57.164
I agree with Matt,
we shouldn't leave if it's dark.

30:57.264 --> 31:00.179
- What the hell? No, we leave now!
- Joe, can you calm down?

31:00.279 --> 31:02.554
Nobody's hurt
and you're overreacting as usual.

31:02.654 --> 31:03.880
Whatever!

31:03.980 --> 31:07.673
- Teddy ran away, Jess.
- I know, he was acting weird.

31:07.973 --> 31:09.976
My phone won't stop recording.

31:10.676 --> 31:14.296
Trey's cell phone was doing the same thing.
It's probably because of this.

31:16.681 --> 31:19.519
- Look at this thing.
- It's crazy, isn't it?

31:19.919 --> 31:23.356
- Matt, can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah, give me a minute.

31:24.456 --> 31:27.393
- Should I be worried?
- I'm sure there's nothing to worry about...

31:27.493 --> 31:29.596
...but let me try to find out
what happened back there.

31:29.696 --> 31:32.365
- Okay. I'll get the bath ready.
- Okay.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.601
Hey, girls! Check this out!

31:35.787 --> 31:38.522
Matt, what's wrong with you?
Why aren't we leaving tonight?

31:38.622 --> 31:40.453
Why do you think it took so long to get here?

31:40.553 --> 31:42.170
- I got lost.
- What?

31:42.270 --> 31:45.254
Yes. We only have enough gas
to make it to the first gas station.

31:45.354 --> 31:47.383
And I'm not sure I can find my way
in the middle of the night.

31:47.483 --> 31:50.523
If we leave and we get lost, then we are
all stuck in the woods. I'm not risking it.

31:50.623 --> 31:54.321
- Why didn't you say it before?
- I didn't think it was a big deal until now.

31:56.421 --> 32:00.460
We lock ourselves in, and we'll be fine.
Nobody gets out tonight.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.797
- Shit.
- All right, let's get inside.

32:04.786 --> 32:06.632
There it is. I told you I got it.

32:06.732 --> 32:11.404
Joe? What the hell is that? I mean, look
at the size of it compared to the trees.

32:11.504 --> 32:14.640
I'm starting to think that
your boss isn't that crazy.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.109
- A Bigfoot?
- Yeah!

32:16.209 --> 32:19.879
- Joe, are you talking about a Bigfoot?
- What else could it be?

32:19.979 --> 32:24.651
It lives in a cave in the middle of nowhere.
It's huge and it's hungry for flesh.

32:24.751 --> 32:27.221
What do you think it could be then?

32:28.421 --> 32:30.957
I'm not sure what to think,
I'll be honest with you right now.

32:31.057 --> 32:34.063
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's his.
What's wrong with it?</i>

32:36.629 --> 32:38.913
All right, that's enough for me.

33:05.090 --> 33:06.926
Are you coming, Matt?

33:07.426 --> 33:09.444
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

33:18.870 --> 33:21.732
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

33:21.832 --> 33:23.663
I'm all right.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.928
Did you find out what it was?

33:29.414 --> 33:30.932
No.

33:32.284 --> 33:34.901
- Joe thinks it might be a Bigfoot.
- A Bigfoot?

33:35.001 --> 33:36.522
Yeah.

33:37.622 --> 33:39.540
That's funny.

33:40.825 --> 33:42.911
I know, it's hard to believe, right?

33:43.763 --> 33:45.780
It's hard to believe.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.219
I'm more concerned about Teddy.

33:52.471 --> 33:54.340
I'm sure he's okay.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.660
It's not his first time running away.
He'll be back.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.796
I don't think so.

34:03.949 --> 34:05.800
He's gone.

34:17.812 --> 34:19.348
Jess.

34:20.899 --> 34:22.751
I'm tired.

34:25.904 --> 34:30.192
I'm really tired of losing people I love.

34:32.377 --> 34:35.397
The baby, Teddy.

34:38.416 --> 34:40.353
- Matt.
- I'm tired of this.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.938
Are you trying to tell me something here?

34:48.360 --> 34:50.896
I don't think I can go through this again.

34:50.996 --> 34:54.620
I can't. I know you wanna
have a baby, but I can't.

34:56.168 --> 34:58.053
I don't think I can.

35:03.408 --> 35:07.061
Having a family is the most
important thing for me.

35:09.581 --> 35:11.433
And a baby is a gift.

35:20.859 --> 35:24.931
I'll understand if you don't want to have one
but you better make your mind up soon.

35:25.031 --> 35:27.282
You might lose someone else you love.

35:29.134 --> 35:30.719
Jess.

35:38.643 --> 35:40.495
Dammit.

35:47.921 --> 35:50.356
- What was that?
- Jess? Jess?

35:51.275 --> 35:55.261
What happened? Holy shit! Are you all right?

35:55.361 --> 35:56.929
- What was that?
- Matt?

35:57.029 --> 35:59.331
- Jess?
- Guys, what happened?

35:59.431 --> 36:01.066
We heard a scream.

36:01.166 --> 36:04.738
Everything's fine. I think a bird
just went kamikaze into our window.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.607
- A bird? Jeez, I thought it was the...
- Are you all right?

36:07.707 --> 36:10.276
No. No, it's not.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.401
- Jess, you're sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

36:12.501 --> 36:14.180
Okay.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.476
Joe, come with me.

36:17.116 --> 36:19.652
Man, that bird scare the shit out of me.

36:19.752 --> 36:21.554
I thought it was that Bigfoot.

36:21.654 --> 36:24.590
Or whatever it was, you know,
that followed us back here.

36:24.690 --> 36:29.362
- Not the birthday you expected, huh?
- Yo, no. Not at all.

36:30.162 --> 36:31.831
To your birthday, man.

36:31.931 --> 36:35.167
Matt, as your best friend
and as your doctor...

36:35.567 --> 36:37.837
...don't you think you've been
drinking a lot lately?

36:37.937 --> 36:41.074
I mean... I know you've had a rough
couple of months, but you got...

36:41.174 --> 36:43.876
But what, Joe? But what?

36:43.976 --> 36:46.178
You need to move on.

36:46.278 --> 36:50.698
You're not the only person that has lost
a baby and at least, you can try again.

36:51.750 --> 36:54.086
And what? Losing another one?

36:54.186 --> 36:56.990
- Take the chance to lose another one?
- Come on, Matt.

36:57.090 --> 37:00.093
Joe, I'm not gonna have
this conservation with you. I'm not.

37:00.193 --> 37:02.629
- Matt, don't be like this.
- I'm going to bed.

37:02.729 --> 37:05.515
- That's right. Just go. Walk away.
- Happy birthday, buddy.

37:05.615 --> 37:07.133
Hide.

37:07.233 --> 37:10.685
And by the way, birds don't fly at night.

37:10.869 --> 37:13.072
I knew it.

37:13.372 --> 37:15.878
I knew it, goddammit!

38:23.942 --> 38:26.194
Stupid phone.

38:28.312 --> 38:30.131
Why won't you stop...

38:37.689 --> 38:39.507
What the hell's going on?

39:01.245 --> 39:03.097
What the hell?

39:55.500 --> 39:57.451
What the hell?

40:01.806 --> 40:03.391
What...

40:51.789 --> 40:53.842
What the hell is going on here?

40:57.261 --> 40:59.547
Shut up, shut up.

41:11.176 --> 41:13.227
What the hell was that?

41:24.122 --> 41:25.639
Hey!

41:26.391 --> 41:28.276
Who's up?

41:39.438 --> 41:41.219
Hey. Who's down there?

41:52.083 --> 41:53.601
Die.

41:55.353 --> 41:56.938
Die.

41:57.622 --> 42:00.107
Die. Die.

42:03.661 --> 42:06.314
Die. Die.

42:07.865 --> 42:10.218
It's too late. It's too late.

42:11.469 --> 42:13.038
Die.

42:13.938 --> 42:15.574
Trey?

42:15.674 --> 42:17.582
What are you doing?

42:17.682 --> 42:19.560
Who are you talking to?

42:23.975 --> 42:26.285
Die? Who's going to die?

42:26.385 --> 42:29.137
You said it was too late. Too late for what?

42:31.856 --> 42:33.908
What's wrong with you, man?

43:15.266 --> 43:17.118
What the hell is this?

43:33.417 --> 43:35.469
We have to leave this place.

43:37.355 --> 43:39.173
That's right.

43:56.007 --> 43:57.792
Oh, God.

43:58.311 --> 44:00.194
Oh, God.

44:47.793 --> 44:48.870
Holy shit!

44:48.970 --> 44:51.831
- You scared the shit out of me, Julia!
- Who are you screaming at?

44:51.931 --> 44:54.667
This... creature was in the cabin.

44:54.767 --> 44:56.936
We're leaving now. Grab your stuff.

44:57.036 --> 45:00.739
- Have you seen Trey anywhere?
- Yeah, he's in your room.

45:00.839 --> 45:02.641
- No, he's not.
- What?

45:02.741 --> 45:05.778
- Yeah, I put him to bed a few minutes ago.
- Not in my bed.

45:05.878 --> 45:09.772
- Julia, what are you talking about?
- I woke up and he wasn't there.

45:09.982 --> 45:12.551
See? Right there.

45:12.651 --> 45:15.069
This is right after I put him to bed.

45:16.820 --> 45:20.125
- What?
- I told you he didn't go to bed.

45:20.225 --> 45:22.309
Why is he walking like that?

45:23.161 --> 45:25.030
Oh, shit.

45:25.730 --> 45:27.548
Where is he going?

45:30.969 --> 45:32.804
Can you see him?

45:33.404 --> 45:34.922
There.

45:36.140 --> 45:38.544
No. No, no. Don't go outside, Trey.

45:38.644 --> 45:40.420
Why is he going out?

45:40.520 --> 45:44.132
- Where is he? Matt, where is he?
- Over there.

45:46.017 --> 45:48.653
- No.
- Trey, where are you going?

45:48.753 --> 45:50.322
The forest.

45:50.422 --> 45:53.474
- Trey.
- No. No.

45:55.193 --> 45:57.412
What the hell is wrong with him?

46:06.203 --> 46:09.657
- Do you have signal?
- No. I don't.

46:15.146 --> 46:16.731
Trey!

46:17.549 --> 46:19.352
What's going on?

46:20.252 --> 46:22.221
Your brother went for a midnight stroll.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.856
- What?
- That's what's going on.

46:23.956 --> 46:25.524
- Trey!
- Why would he do that?

46:25.624 --> 46:29.128
- You tell me!
- Oh, no. I told him not to go outside.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.713
- Trey!
- Stop screaming!

46:33.364 --> 46:36.050
Trey! Answer me!

46:37.135 --> 46:39.220
Trey, come on.

46:43.608 --> 46:46.059
Listen. Listen.

46:48.012 --> 46:51.032
We need to get back inside. Now.

46:56.888 --> 46:59.324
Trey? Trey, is that you?

46:59.424 --> 47:02.061
- We shouldn't be out here.
- Trey.

47:02.961 --> 47:05.846
- Screw this! I'm going to get him!
- Hey, hey, no!

47:05.946 --> 47:08.700
- What?
- I told you it was too dangerous.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.938
- Matt, we gotta do something.
- You and your stupid monster!

47:13.038 --> 47:16.341
All right, that's it!
I'm gonna go wake up Joe.

47:16.441 --> 47:18.677
Jess, make sure she doesn't go in there.

47:18.777 --> 47:20.461
Okay.

47:21.096 --> 47:23.351
- What's going on?
- Trey!

47:26.150 --> 47:29.387
- Julia!
- Jess! Where's Julia?

47:29.487 --> 47:32.224
- She just went in there.
- I told you to keep her here.

47:32.324 --> 47:35.460
Yeah, I know, I know.
She went in, what do you want me to do?

47:35.560 --> 47:38.497
- What's going on?
- Julia's in the forest.

47:38.597 --> 47:41.006
- What? You're kidding me right?
- I wish.

47:41.106 --> 47:43.902
- Shit. I knew we should've left last night.
- Guys, what happened?

47:44.002 --> 47:47.673
You guys, get back in the cabin
and try to call for help. Let's go, Joe.

47:47.773 --> 47:50.993
- Matt, what the hell is going on here?
- Trey?

47:51.093 --> 47:53.912
I gotta be the dumbest idiot to follow you.

47:54.012 --> 47:56.749
If I die here, you better tell
my mom it was your fault.

47:56.849 --> 47:59.227
Hey! I'm not losing anyone else.

48:01.085 --> 48:04.372
I'm sorry, Matty. I'm sorry.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.275
Julia?

48:09.473 --> 48:10.996
Trey?

48:11.196 --> 48:12.698
Julia?

48:13.098 --> 48:16.535
I can't believe we're back in these woods
'cause of that little brat.

48:17.135 --> 48:18.190
Trey?

48:18.290 --> 48:21.724
I just don't understand why he had
to come back. It doesn't make sense.

48:21.824 --> 48:24.243
Look, I don't think Trey
knew what he was doing.

48:24.343 --> 48:26.511
What? Tell me what's going on here then!

48:26.611 --> 48:29.081
Trey walked in the forest
like a frickin' zombie.

48:29.181 --> 48:31.850
Like some kind of force was dragging him in.

48:31.950 --> 48:35.688
- He looked like he was hypnotized.
- What do you mean, "hypnotized"?

48:35.788 --> 48:40.275
When I went downstairs, he kept repeating
'die, die'. Something was going to die.

48:40.375 --> 48:42.255
- Or someone.
- Die?

48:42.355 --> 48:44.497
- I don't know if... I don't know!
- Who's gonna die?

48:44.597 --> 48:46.060
There's one thing I know...

48:46.160 --> 48:49.848
...this thing, this creature,
whatever it is, was in the cabin...

48:49.948 --> 48:51.801
- ...after Trey disappeared.
- What?

48:51.901 --> 48:54.206
I didn't say anything.
I didn't want to scare the girls.

48:54.306 --> 48:56.543
That's great of you, Matt.
That's real sweet of you...

48:56.643 --> 48:59.050
...'cause you're scaring
the shit out of me now!

49:24.485 --> 49:27.622
- Hey!
- Matt! Don't!

49:30.492 --> 49:32.560
What do you want from us?

49:35.813 --> 49:38.653
- Look.
- What could they want?

49:51.061 --> 49:52.946
They're leaving.

50:11.350 --> 50:13.401
Oh, shit, Matt!

50:19.327 --> 50:21.726
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

50:21.826 --> 50:23.845
Go, go, go!

50:26.134 --> 50:29.387
- Oh, my God!
- Turn off the light. Turn off the light!

50:29.487 --> 50:31.372
Turn it off!

50:34.005 --> 50:37.209
- No, I don't think so.
- Let's get back now. Let's go!

50:37.309 --> 50:39.527
No! Not without Trey and Julia!

50:42.113 --> 50:45.817
I... I can't place a call,
my phone is still recording.

50:45.917 --> 50:48.102
Try mine. It might work.

50:52.923 --> 50:56.884
- <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Yes, 911! Yeah, hi.

50:56.984 --> 51:01.033
My name is Jessica Donovan, we're staying
at a cottage in Gracefield, Quebec.

51:01.133 --> 51:05.603
And the address is 1111... 1111 Ranger Lake.

51:05.703 --> 51:08.551
Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear...

51:08.651 --> 51:11.544
My brother and his girlfriend disappeared
in the forest after deciding...

51:11.644 --> 51:13.945
- <i>...triangulate your location.</i>
- Hello?

51:14.045 --> 51:18.050
Shit! Hello, can you hear... if you can
hear me, can you just please send help?

51:18.150 --> 51:19.700
<i>Ma'am?</i>

51:21.619 --> 51:25.324
The call dropped. The call dropped!
There's no... there's no signal.

51:25.424 --> 51:27.192
Oh, my God!

51:27.292 --> 51:29.110
Look what I've found.

51:31.278 --> 51:33.115
Bigfoot sightings?

51:33.965 --> 51:35.849
What the hell is this?

51:38.269 --> 51:42.107
- That's the cabin.
- And... the cave they went to.

51:42.207 --> 51:45.877
- Cornfield.
- Farmer Blackburn's property.

51:46.477 --> 51:47.879
This is insane.

51:47.979 --> 51:51.031
Okay. Matt's boss is a lot crazier
than I thought.

51:54.051 --> 51:55.921
That's not gonna work.

51:56.721 --> 52:00.425
Yes, it is gonna work. The balloons
are gonna track us back to the cabin.

52:00.525 --> 52:03.694
- This is so ridiculous!
- Hey, do you have a better plan?

52:03.794 --> 52:06.613
'Cause I'm not getting lost
in these woods again.

52:07.965 --> 52:10.818
Let's go. Let's find Trey
and Julia and get out of here.

52:16.140 --> 52:17.691
Trey?

52:18.342 --> 52:20.227
Where are you?

52:21.912 --> 52:23.178
Trey!

52:24.048 --> 52:28.669
Look, you don't need to try
and impress me anymore, okay?

52:30.654 --> 52:33.307
I can't even see the cabin from here!

52:42.132 --> 52:44.017
There you are.

52:45.069 --> 52:47.121
Why did you come back here?

52:51.642 --> 52:54.928
Trey! Can you please answer me?

53:04.289 --> 53:05.873
Trey?

53:07.624 --> 53:09.710
Where the hell did you go?

53:31.216 --> 53:33.867
Julia! Julia!

53:35.186 --> 53:36.722
Julia!

53:37.422 --> 53:40.307
Julia? Where is she?

53:40.958 --> 53:43.410
- Julia!
- Julia!

53:44.895 --> 53:47.098
- You see anything?
- No!

53:47.198 --> 53:48.782
Julia!

53:52.903 --> 53:56.639
- Where the hell is she?
- She can't be that far.

53:56.739 --> 53:59.007
I think our minds' are playing
tricks on us. Let's get out of here.

53:59.107 --> 54:02.981
- No! No, no. We can't.
- Come on.

54:03.481 --> 54:05.166
Julia!

54:07.639 --> 54:09.181
Joe.

54:09.524 --> 54:12.030
Joe. Joe.

54:12.130 --> 54:13.992
Is that Julia's?

54:14.092 --> 54:15.642
Yeah.

54:17.528 --> 54:19.329
Julia!

54:19.998 --> 54:22.601
Oh, my God!

54:22.701 --> 54:24.269
What?

54:25.200 --> 54:26.787
Matt!

54:27.538 --> 54:29.741
Holy shit.

54:29.841 --> 54:32.176
What the hell did they do to her?

54:32.276 --> 54:34.761
How did her clothes get up there?

54:36.430 --> 54:39.351
Matt, what's going on? What happened to her?

54:39.451 --> 54:41.268
I don't know.

54:42.186 --> 54:44.528
What the hell was that?

54:44.628 --> 54:46.907
Trey! Trey!

54:47.191 --> 54:49.224
No, no, Matt!

54:57.134 --> 54:59.738
Trey! Where are you?

55:00.138 --> 55:01.688
Matt!

55:05.542 --> 55:07.394
Matt! Where are you?

55:09.180 --> 55:11.432
Matt! Where are you?

55:13.185 --> 55:14.735
Trey!

55:21.091 --> 55:23.376
What the hell happened here?

55:23.895 --> 55:26.631
He's not here. Where the hell is he?

55:26.731 --> 55:31.136
- Matt. Let's get out of here! Now!
- No! I'm not leaving anybody behind.

55:31.236 --> 55:35.740
I don't like this place, man. I don't think
we're gonna find Trey or Julia here.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.701
- Guys!
- Stop, Matt.

55:37.801 --> 55:40.245
- Stop.
- Hey! We can't leave them here.

55:40.345 --> 55:44.917
No, Matt. But look around you.
Look around you. The corn is 12 feet tall.

55:45.017 --> 55:48.620
Everywhere you look,
it's the same damn thing!

55:48.720 --> 55:52.724
The only way you're gonna find
someone here, is with a helicopter.

55:53.124 --> 55:55.192
What did you say?

55:55.292 --> 55:58.392
I said that the only way
you're gonna find someone here...

55:58.492 --> 56:00.306
...is through the air
and unless you learned...

56:00.406 --> 56:02.490
- That's it. That's it.
- What "it"?

56:02.590 --> 56:05.189
- Gimme your phone. Gimme your phone.
- Matt, it has no reception.

56:05.289 --> 56:08.330
It doesn't matter. You just said it...

56:08.430 --> 56:12.143
...if we can tie this to the balloons,
right, and we can get it airborne.

56:12.243 --> 56:14.278
And then we'll have
a whole perspective on this place.

56:14.378 --> 56:17.782
Exactly! How many balloons
do we have left? Come on.

56:17.882 --> 56:21.077
- Shit, we only have two.
- Shit!

56:23.053 --> 56:25.023
- What?
- Joe.

56:25.123 --> 56:27.374
What? What is it?

56:28.525 --> 56:30.361
Our balloons.

56:30.461 --> 56:32.312
What the...

56:32.676 --> 56:35.349
Those are the balloons we used in the forest.

56:38.535 --> 56:42.140
- Are they doing this to us?
- Who else can it be?

56:42.240 --> 56:43.586
Why?

56:43.686 --> 56:45.260
- Grab them.
- Yeah, but how...

56:45.360 --> 56:48.313
- It doesn't matter. Just pick them up!
- How are we gonna get back?

56:49.013 --> 56:51.349
- Is it recording?
- Yeah.

56:51.449 --> 56:52.999
Perfect.

56:55.753 --> 56:58.477
- All right, let it go.
- All right.

56:58.577 --> 57:02.018
- You really think this is gonna work?
- Yes. I do.

57:02.536 --> 57:05.130
- Don't drop it.
- I'm not gonna drop it.

57:05.230 --> 57:07.347
Come on. Higher.

57:07.932 --> 57:10.551
It's working. It's working!

57:48.205 --> 57:51.209
- Holy shit!
- What is that?

57:51.609 --> 57:54.879
- This... this symbol.
- What is it? What?

57:54.979 --> 57:57.382
I saw this symbol last night on TV.

57:57.482 --> 58:00.088
- Just before Trey disappeared.
- You saw this before?

58:00.188 --> 58:02.787
- Yeah.
- And you're telling me this now?

58:02.887 --> 58:06.091
- What does it mean?
- How should I know what it means, Joe?

58:06.591 --> 58:10.062
- What the hell are we dealing with here?
- Maybe they're trying to communicate with us.

58:10.162 --> 58:14.399
They? Who's they?
And what the hell do they want from us?

58:14.899 --> 58:16.400
- Trey?
- What?

58:16.500 --> 58:17.502
- Trey!
- Where?

58:17.602 --> 58:19.152
There.

58:20.504 --> 58:23.374
Trey! Trey!

58:23.474 --> 58:25.243
- Matt!
- Where are you?

58:26.990 --> 58:30.715
- Hold on! We're coming!
- Matt, hold on! Wait for me!

58:30.815 --> 58:32.517
Shit! Shit!

58:32.617 --> 58:35.235
- Where are you, kid?
- Wait!

58:39.322 --> 58:42.927
- Matt, wait up!
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

58:43.327 --> 58:44.911
Trey!

58:45.462 --> 58:47.014
Matt!

58:47.998 --> 58:49.868
Oh, God.

58:49.968 --> 58:51.359
Oh, God.

58:55.072 --> 58:56.908
Oh, shit.

58:57.008 --> 58:58.702
Oh, shit.

58:58.802 --> 59:00.827
Trey is gone, man.

59:02.213 --> 59:04.015
Can you believe...

59:04.115 --> 59:06.166
Matt, Matt.

59:13.992 --> 59:15.909
Go, go, go, go!

59:28.672 --> 59:30.557
Matt! Matt!

01:00:06.343 --> 01:00:08.195
Oh, shit!

01:00:32.535 --> 01:00:34.375
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:00:39.843 --> 01:00:43.315
- Those things are looking for us.
- Holy shit.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:45.750
You think we lost them?

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.154
No, I don't think so, Joe.
We can't stay here. We have to go.

01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:51.523
What's going on? What just happened?
Where's Trey? Where's Julia?

01:00:51.623 --> 01:00:54.626
I don't know, Joe!
I don't have the answer to that!

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:58.262
But I have a really weird feeling
that they used Trey as a messenger.

01:00:58.362 --> 01:00:59.834
- A messenger?
- Yes!

01:00:59.934 --> 01:01:02.103
When I went downstairs last night,
he wasn't feeling well.

01:01:02.203 --> 01:01:04.068
Why? Because they did something to him.

01:01:04.168 --> 01:01:06.137
- They gave him a message.
- A message?

01:01:06.237 --> 01:01:09.357
Yes! About this... this someone,
something, that was going to die.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:12.210
All this nonsense that he kept
repeating in the basement.

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:14.012
- Why would they use Trey?
- Why?

01:01:14.112 --> 01:01:16.414
Because these things are trying
to communicate with us!

01:01:16.514 --> 01:01:19.183
You were right about this.
They were listening to us out there.

01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:23.303
There's a reason why they gave us back
our balloons when we needed them.

01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.739
They wanted us to see that symbol.

01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:29.943
Yeah, but what does it mean?

01:01:31.694 --> 01:01:33.531
I don't know what it means.

01:01:34.831 --> 01:01:37.322
- But it's not important for now.
- Yes, it is!

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:40.992
Come on, Matt. Think about it. These things
are getting more and more aggressive...

01:01:41.092 --> 01:01:43.607
...and impatient with us.
We gotta figure it out.

01:01:43.707 --> 01:01:45.943
We will but right now,
we just have to get to the cabin...

01:01:46.043 --> 01:01:49.914
- ...get the girls and get some help.
- And how are we supposed to do that?

01:01:50.014 --> 01:01:53.851
We have no guide, we have no way
to get back. We're lost.

01:01:53.951 --> 01:01:57.121
Shit. We can't stay here.

01:01:57.221 --> 01:01:59.948
- Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
- What? What?

01:02:01.058 --> 01:02:04.395
The balloons.
They weren't there a second ago.

01:02:04.495 --> 01:02:06.764
Maybe they'll lead us back to the cabin.

01:02:06.864 --> 01:02:09.200
- No. No!
- Look, Joe...

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.810
...there's no other option.
I say we go. All right?

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.240
- Let's go before these things come back.
- No, no, no, no, think about it.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.442
There's no other option.
I'm not staying here.

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:20.378
- They're probably around us right now.
- I'm not staying here. I'm going.

01:02:20.478 --> 01:02:23.778
No, no, no! Wait, wait!
They're probably watching us right now!

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.750
- Oh, shit!
- What's going on?

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:27.719
- I dropped my eye.
- Matt, forget it!

01:02:27.819 --> 01:02:30.533
- We can't lose time with this. Let's go!
- It must be here, I need it.

01:02:30.633 --> 01:02:33.181
- It recorded the whole thing.
- What? I knew it!

01:02:33.281 --> 01:02:35.393
That's what the red light was all about.

01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:38.329
There it is. Good. All right.

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:39.951
Okay, let's go!

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.748
We made it.

01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:46.570
Come on!

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.496
- Liz!
- Joe? In here.

01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:52.342
- Where we you guys?
- Where's Trey?

01:02:52.442 --> 01:02:53.811
- And Julia?
- We couldn't find them.

01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:56.681
- What do you mean you couldn't find them?
- They have to be somewhere.

01:02:56.781 --> 01:02:59.540
We looked everywhere,
we couldn't find them. Drop it.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.928
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.022
Jess, calm down.
We did everything we could, but...

01:03:05.122 --> 01:03:08.336
- Tell me this is not happening.
- Jess, we have to get out of here.

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:11.129
I'm not leaving my brother here.
Are you crazy?

01:03:11.229 --> 01:03:15.417
- We can't stay here! Do you understand me?
- I'm not leaving him. They might come back.

01:03:16.767 --> 01:03:19.737
- Matt, you can't stay here.
- I know but Jess won't leave her brother.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:23.132
- Take the camera, you might need the light.
- Okay, thanks.

01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:27.211
I think the gas station is about 25 miles
from here but I'm not sure where exactly.

01:03:27.311 --> 01:03:29.180
We'll be back soon.
It shouldn't take us too long.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.517
Yeah, the sooner, the better. Be careful!

01:03:32.617 --> 01:03:34.902
I'm sure Trey and Julia are gonna be fine.

01:03:37.455 --> 01:03:40.090
- That's not reassuring.
- No.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.493
- It doesn't want to start.
- No.

01:03:42.593 --> 01:03:45.077
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

01:03:46.596 --> 01:03:49.066
- Oh, shit!
- What's wrong with it?

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.782
- The fuse box fried.
- Shit!

01:03:51.882 --> 01:03:55.707
- It's probably another surge.
- But we haven't used this since we got here.

01:03:56.807 --> 01:03:59.410
It's probably the same frequency
that fried the fuse box inside the house.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:02.892
- So it was caused by the power surge we got?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

01:04:02.992 --> 01:04:05.617
- Can you fix it, baby?
- Yeah, with my eyes closed.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.752
If I had an other fuse but I don't.

01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:11.054
We're stuck here, we're not
going anywhere the way it is.

01:04:12.208 --> 01:04:14.106
What do we do now?

01:04:18.061 --> 01:04:19.627
I got an idea.

01:04:20.997 --> 01:04:23.768
You wanna use the bikes? Come on, Joe!

01:04:23.868 --> 01:04:25.569
What time is it?

01:04:25.669 --> 01:04:28.239
Shit! My watch is still messed up.

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:33.832
We got about five hours before sunset. Liz
and I can make it to the gas station within...

01:04:33.932 --> 01:04:36.978
- Look, Joe, I don't think this is a good...
- Matt! We have no choice.

01:04:37.078 --> 01:04:39.783
Liz! I think you should stay with us.

01:04:39.883 --> 01:04:44.088
Hey, I'm not gonna let him go by himself
with these things around.

01:04:44.188 --> 01:04:46.557
Plus he needs me to cover his ass.

01:04:46.657 --> 01:04:49.260
Guys, we'll be back in a couple
hours with some help.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.830
Joe, you stay on the road, no matter what,
you stay on the road, okay?

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:56.783
Don't worry, man. We'll be back in
a couple hours. Come on, Liz. Let's go!

01:05:00.871 --> 01:05:02.373
Joe?

01:05:02.473 --> 01:05:03.990
Joe?

01:05:15.653 --> 01:05:17.503
Oh, there.

01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:19.891
Press stop.

01:05:20.991 --> 01:05:23.907
- Oh, my God!
- I knew I heard something.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.631
- Oh, my God! What happened to Liz and Joe?
- I'm not sure.

01:05:26.731 --> 01:05:29.872
- And what happened to my brother and Julia?
- I don't know.

01:05:29.972 --> 01:05:32.745
I mean, look, Jess, we...
we found them in this cornfield.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:34.304
What?

01:05:34.404 --> 01:05:38.006
- After we discovered that symbol.
- No, no, no, no. No, no!

01:05:38.106 --> 01:05:41.212
What happened to him? What was this symbol?
What does it have to do with anything?

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.880
- I don't know.
- Matt! What's going on?

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.184
I don't know! Okay? So can you
calm down and help me find some clues.

01:05:47.284 --> 01:05:49.486
I would really appreciate it.

01:05:49.586 --> 01:05:54.012
- <i>Matt! Watch out!</i>
- Shit! I thought I deleted this.

01:05:54.757 --> 01:05:56.642
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:05:58.428 --> 01:06:01.332
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:06:01.432 --> 01:06:04.250
I'll see if I can find anything
on Joe's camera.

01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:10.354
<i>Early this morning an American
satellite was destroyed...</i>

01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:14.085
<i>...by what authorities are calling
an unidentified object.</i>

01:06:14.185 --> 01:06:16.180
- Hold on.
- <i>Images taken by the satellite itself...</i>

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.550
- This?
- Yeah. Play it again.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:21.685
<i>...authorities are calling
an unidentified object.</i>

01:06:21.785 --> 01:06:25.210
<i>Images taken by the satellite itself
moments before it was destroyed...</i>

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:30.943
<i>...seem to indicate that a collision between
the satellite and the object was the cause.</i>

01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:34.647
Stop! Hold on.

01:06:36.366 --> 01:06:38.970
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God!

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:42.640
Oh, my God! It tried to grab you!

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.891
Shit.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:49.029
It wasn't trying to grab me.

01:06:50.447 --> 01:06:53.499
Matt! Matt, open the door!

01:06:54.918 --> 01:06:57.555
Matt, please. What are you doing in there?

01:06:57.955 --> 01:07:00.040
Why did you lock yourself in?

01:07:03.059 --> 01:07:05.545
I'm really worried so open the door.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.803
Matt?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.464
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.512
- Tell me what's going on.
- The symbol.

01:07:21.612 --> 01:07:26.161
Matt, you're really, really scaring me
right now. Open the door! Open up!

01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:28.485
Matt! Open the door!

01:07:28.585 --> 01:07:31.289
- What are you doing in there?
- We're leaving this place in 30 seconds!

01:07:31.389 --> 01:07:33.958
What? Can you tell me what's going on?

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:37.195
It has been looking
for this rock the whole time.

01:07:37.295 --> 01:07:39.830
Holy shit! What do you think it is?

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.267
Maybe some kind of radio
transmitting device or something.

01:07:44.067 --> 01:07:47.404
Yeah. Look, there's only one way out of this.

01:07:47.504 --> 01:07:51.509
We're gonna give them this rock
but only if they give us back our friends.

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:54.928
Otherwise, we're not giving them anything.

01:08:02.485 --> 01:08:03.788
- Wait! Wait!
- What?

01:08:03.888 --> 01:08:06.658
No. Not that way. We'll take the basement.

01:08:06.758 --> 01:08:09.326
- No.
- They might be right outside.

01:08:09.426 --> 01:08:11.361
I think it's safer.

01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:13.346
Okay, let's go.

01:08:21.938 --> 01:08:24.812
- I don't wanna go.
- Let me go first. Here.

01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:28.493
Grab the camera. Let's go, follow me.

01:08:29.946 --> 01:08:33.433
We saw this creature today, in a cornfield.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.140
We have to find a way to
make it there without them seeing us.

01:08:43.259 --> 01:08:46.112
I think that's why they have
your brother and Julia.

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:52.986
Turn off the light. Turn off the light.

01:08:57.473 --> 01:08:58.542
What's your plan?

01:08:58.642 --> 01:09:00.944
The cornfield is about
a quarter mile from here.

01:09:01.044 --> 01:09:04.076
There's a farm on the edge of it.
We have to find a way to make it there...

01:09:04.176 --> 01:09:05.951
- ...and call for help.
- Come on, are you sure?

01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.125
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:12.402
What?

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.895
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.835
We have to go.

01:09:18.524 --> 01:09:20.596
Matt, what the hell are you doing?

01:09:22.564 --> 01:09:26.051
- What's the matter, Matt?
- They're here.

01:09:33.676 --> 01:09:35.845
Go, go, go! Go!

01:09:35.946 --> 01:09:39.599
Let's get out of here. Go upstairs!

01:09:41.853 --> 01:09:44.220
Run, run, run!

01:09:44.321 --> 01:09:47.457
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:50.361
- What the hell is going on?
- Holy shit!

01:09:50.461 --> 01:09:52.633
What's going on?

01:09:52.733 --> 01:09:56.300
- What the...
- Oh, my God! Take cover, Jess!

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.485
We're gonna die!

01:10:01.839 --> 01:10:04.978
Make it stop! Please!

01:10:08.544 --> 01:10:10.830
Make it stop!

01:10:11.915 --> 01:10:13.933
Make it stop!

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:30.701
Jess! Jess!

01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:33.036
Oh, shit!

01:10:33.136 --> 01:10:35.506
Are you all right? Hey!

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:38.879
- I wanna go. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- We gotta go. We gotta go!

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.104
We're good.

01:11:06.036 --> 01:11:08.805
What? What?

01:11:08.905 --> 01:11:10.541
What's going on?

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:13.227
- Holy shit.
- What happened?

01:11:13.327 --> 01:11:15.646
Matt, what happened to Liz and Joe?

01:11:15.746 --> 01:11:18.998
We need to get into that forest.
Let's go, now!

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:28.340
Run! Run!

01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:44.875
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:48.060
Go, go, go, go!

01:11:59.457 --> 01:12:02.107
- Oh, my God.
- Shit. What? What?

01:12:04.794 --> 01:12:07.679
- We can't stay.
- I can't breathe.

01:12:09.198 --> 01:12:13.023
I can't. I can't breathe.

01:12:14.438 --> 01:12:16.022
Matt!

01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:24.181
Let him go. Let him go!

01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:25.832
Matt!

01:12:31.121 --> 01:12:33.290
- No!
- No, no, no!

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.941
Run!

01:12:36.392 --> 01:12:38.610
Quick! Quick!

01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:42.415
Oh, shit!

01:12:45.435 --> 01:12:47.338
Keep going!

01:12:47.438 --> 01:12:50.688
Go! Go, go, go! Go, go!

01:12:52.475 --> 01:12:55.212
Matt! Get up! Get up!

01:12:55.312 --> 01:12:58.349
Let's go! Matt! Give them the rock.

01:12:58.449 --> 01:13:02.334
No. No. They have to give us
our friends first.

01:13:07.889 --> 01:13:09.408
Jess!

01:13:13.796 --> 01:13:15.347
Jess.

01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:22.614
I'm not gonna lose you. I'm not gonna
lose you too. I'm not gonna lose you.

01:13:28.412 --> 01:13:31.848
Jess! Jess! Jess!

01:13:31.948 --> 01:13:33.532
Jess!

01:13:34.984 --> 01:13:38.961
Jess! Jess! Jess! Jess!

01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:40.472
Jess!

01:13:49.366 --> 01:13:51.435
Where is my wife?

01:13:51.835 --> 01:13:53.686
Where are my friends?

01:13:56.939 --> 01:13:59.543
Where is my wife? Where is my wife?

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:03.480
I'm not giving you this rock
until you give me my wife.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I lost you, baby.

01:16:00.964 --> 01:16:03.767
I'm... I'm sorry we...

01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:06.819
...we... we didn't know.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:27.284
Matt? Matt?

01:17:27.384 --> 01:17:28.985
- Liz!
- Joe!

01:17:29.085 --> 01:17:31.960
- Are you okay?
- You're alive! You're alive!

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.090
Joe? Joe, is that you?

01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:35.459
- Trey?
- Julia?

01:17:35.559 --> 01:17:37.161
- What happened to us?
- I don't remember.

01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:40.163
<i>This is Lieutenant Stewart
from the Canadian Air Force.</i>

01:17:40.263 --> 01:17:43.834
<i>We got a 911 emergency call
from Jessica Donovan.</i>

01:17:43.934 --> 01:17:47.420
<i>Please follow our light and regroup
all to the same location...</i>

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.917
<i>...until further instructions.</i>

01:17:49.017 --> 01:17:52.075
<i>I repeat, follow our light and
regroup at the same location...</i>

01:17:52.175 --> 01:17:54.211
<i>...and wait until further instructions.</i>

01:17:54.311 --> 01:17:57.539
<i>We're going to find a place to land
and come and get you. You're safe now.</i>

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.493
<i>You're going home.</i>

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.704
Hey.

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:44.117
Hey.
