03:55.583 --> 03:57.500
Aw, no one said nothing, man.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.041
He said that?

04:41.958 --> 04:44.375
Nah, nah,

See you later, Nisha.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.541
Nish, you're a ball
of negative energy,

14:57.583 --> 14:59.041
- do you know that?
- What?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.583
I ain't saying
you can't act like her,

15:00.625 --> 15:01.916
I'm saying
you don't sound like her.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.416
Your voices are different.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.583
Of course it's different.
I'm a different person.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.500
It doesn't mean anything.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.458
Hi. How you doing?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.375
I was just looking at
that red dress in the window.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.916
- Here.
- Wow.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.166
Look at this.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.958
Yeah, it looks nice.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.875
Nish. What do you think? Look.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.208
Hmm. Yeah.

15:53.916 --> 15:55.000
How much is it, hon?

15:56.041 --> 15:59.291
Oh, the Lily Marvin? It's 279.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.708
Babe.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.166
Ask if they can
hold it for a bit.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.916
Do you think you can hold it
'til the end of the month?

16:07.958 --> 16:10.583
Oh, I can only hold
it for 24 hours, I'm afraid.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.000
Really sorry.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.125
- Yo.
- Oh, yeah, you all right?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.041
- My brother's here?
- Yeah, he's just at the front.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.041
They don't even know
.

17:00.916 --> 17:02.666
So, bruv,

17:02.708 --> 17:04.666
I'm just repeating
what you said, innit?

17:04.708 --> 17:07.375
You said you were all good,
and I've interviewed a good guy.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.041
He was a qualified chef,
in fact.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.791
- All right.
- Yo, where you going?

17:10.833 --> 17:12.750
Yo, bruv. Hey, hey, hey.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.875
You give up too easy,
you know that?

17:14.916 --> 17:16.375
- Where's your grip, bruv?
- What?

17:17.833 --> 17:19.833
You're telling me you gave
the job to someone else.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.833
What, you want me
to fucking beg you?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.666
Sit down.

17:30.541 --> 17:31.625
Sit down.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.541
Do you know
what the definition of grit is?

17:45.583 --> 17:48.000
When a man does not take "no"
for an answer.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.083
You don't need to be quoting
no Tony Robbins to me, G.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.500
I'm trying to impart
some wisdom, little bro.

17:52.541 --> 17:55.541
And yes,
you should be begging me.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.375
Here's what I can do.

17:58.416 --> 18:00.916
Kitchen porter.
Doing the dishes, nothing much,

18:00.958 --> 18:04.375
8.50 an hour. If you're up for
that, then maybe I can help you.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.333
Hey, that's all I got.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.458
Look at you. Man's
right now, innit?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.708
Do you want a job or not?

18:43.083 --> 18:45.583
How did you afford this?

18:46.791 --> 18:47.916
I got a job.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.333
Not with Clive?

19:07.458 --> 19:08.541
Come over here.

19:11.875 --> 19:12.958
Excuse me?

19:14.875 --> 19:16.125
Who do you think
you're talking to?

19:17.875 --> 19:19.041
You little bitch.

19:22.791 --> 19:23.875
Who's my little bitch?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.375
Did you not hear me?

19:29.583 --> 19:31.333
Yeah.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.458
I did.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.166
Let me hear you say it, then.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.708
I'm a little bitch.

19:50.583 --> 19:51.666
Mmm...

19:54.208 --> 19:55.458
I can't hear you.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.000
I'm your little bitch.

20:04.625 --> 20:05.708
Turn.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.125
Let me see you.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.583

20:24.083 --> 20:25.291
I wanna see more.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.458
Don't be calling 'em dickheads,
all right?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.833
Get off.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.041
Brush your teeth
before you kiss me like that!

21:27.916 --> 21:29.458
Nisha.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.041
You're not gonna wish me luck?

21:31.083 --> 21:33.000
Uh, sorry. Good luck.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.916
What are you doing later?

21:35.958 --> 21:38.000
Wanna have a little girl's trip
after school?

21:38.041 --> 21:39.583
You're the one always
saying we're broke.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.166
Yeah, but we can have a look

21:41.208 --> 21:42.750
and then buy it
when I get paid next week.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.208
Come on.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.958
Don't you wanna
get something nice?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.750
Look peng for all the boys?

21:47.791 --> 21:50.083
- No.
- Look peng for the girls, then?

21:51.083 --> 21:52.583
What's your issue?

21:52.625 --> 21:54.375
I ain't got no issue, hon.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.875
I just wanna spend time
together like mum and daughter.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.833
Do you know what? Forget it.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.375
Go on, Nish.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.708
Fucking bitch.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.250
Cicely.

22:23.291 --> 22:24.833
- Was that your mum?
- Yeah.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.666
She's so pretty.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.208
I was watching her on YouTube
again the other day.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.083
Oh, my God, why, man?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.750
Fill me in, come on.

22:31.791 --> 22:33.791
So, like, are your mum and dad
banging 24/7

22:33.833 --> 22:35.250
- now that he's back from jail?
- Hey, chill out.

22:36.791 --> 22:38.250
You're the one
that said you heard them

22:38.291 --> 22:39.750
- banging for ten hours.
- No, I didn't.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.333
- Yeah, you did.
- Chill out, chill out.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.291
Hey, Cicely.
Come here a minute.

22:43.958 --> 22:45.083
See you later, yeah?

22:58.916 --> 23:00.000
Candice May?

23:01.291 --> 23:02.375
Yes.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.375
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.500
Hey, Candice.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.125
John, hey.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.500
Thank you.

23:17.541 --> 23:19.000
So, Candice, how are you?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.500
- I'm okay, thank you.
- Good.

23:21.541 --> 23:24.500
Your agent told us we're about
to meet Tina Turner herself.

23:24.541 --> 23:25.666
Oh, no,

23:25.708 --> 23:27.166
I'm just a bit of a stan.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.833
Thank you for letting me
come in today.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.916
- You're very welcome.
- That dress is gorgeous!

23:30.958 --> 23:32.541
Thank you very much. Thank you.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.416
- Yeah, it's really gorgeous.
- Thank you.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.333
So, what are you
singing for us today?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.208
"River Deep, Mountain High."

23:38.250 --> 23:41.375
"River Deep,
Mountain High." Brilliant.

23:41.416 --> 23:42.583
Are we good to go?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.291

Shit.

28:07.875 --> 28:10.291
Fuck.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.416
What are you doing home? Huh?

28:14.458 --> 28:15.541
What you doing?

28:17.583 --> 28:18.666
What's that?

28:21.791 --> 28:23.458
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.833
This don't belong to you,
does it?

28:30.916 --> 28:33.041
- Does it?
- No, sorry.

29:05.708 --> 29:06.791
What are you doing?

29:08.250 --> 29:10.000
They want me back.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.500
- Serious?
- Yeah.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.000
- What?
- Yes, babe.

29:14.041 --> 29:15.833
Come on!

29:15.875 --> 29:18.833
Ah! Oh... oh, yeah.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.500
- My girl.
- Yes.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.791
Mm-hmm. Come on.

29:22.833 --> 29:25.500
- Hey, what's this?
- You all right, babe?

29:25.541 --> 29:28.416
- How you doing, love?
- Mmm, good, thanks. How are you?

29:28.458 --> 29:30.125
I'm good. You are looking fire.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.625
- Thank you, thank you.
- Celebrating, are we?

29:31.666 --> 29:32.916
Yeah.
Did Trav not tell you

29:32.958 --> 29:34.250
who I'm auditioning for?

29:34.291 --> 29:35.375
No, what's this?

29:37.125 --> 29:41.083
I got a recall to play
Tina Turner in a new musical.

29:41.125 --> 29:42.875
- Is it?
- Yeah.

29:42.916 --> 29:45.291
Well, that's something
to celebrate proper, bruv.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.083
She want some Prosecco,
not a shot.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.666
- No, I'm good.
- No, no, no, no, no.

29:48.708 --> 29:50.583
We're celebrating,
and you deserve it.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.250
Tell you what.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.750
Trav, give Ter a hand
with the stock check

29:53.791 --> 29:55.000
and you can get off
at half past.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.708
I'll sort Candy a drink.

29:56.750 --> 29:58.291
What,
don't you wanna get home early?

30:01.583 --> 30:03.041
Nah, you two enjoy yourselves, yeah?

30:04.250 --> 30:05.791
- I'll wait for you, babe.
- Cool.

30:05.833 --> 30:06.916
All right?

30:08.333 --> 30:09.916
- You good?
- Oh, yeah.

30:09.958 --> 30:11.583
- How's things?
- Oh, lovely.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.083
Sorry about him.
It doesn't hurt to celebrate.

30:50.541 --> 30:51.625
Ike and Tina?

30:53.208 --> 30:54.500
I was at the
Everly Brothers concert.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.416
- You seen it?
- Of course I have.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.875
Still looking for lead vocals,
I tell you.

31:01.958 --> 31:03.833
Did you just roll your eyes?

31:03.875 --> 31:05.541
- No, I was blinking.
- Oi.

31:07.458 --> 31:10.583
The gig in the pub, babe, yes.
You've told me several times.

31:11.958 --> 31:14.875
How about we rehearse
a couple of Ike and Tina covers?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.625
Get you in shape.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.583
Come on, it'd be lush.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.041
Look,
I'll think about it, all right?

31:21.083 --> 31:22.250
No promises.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.833
- You're joking me.
- What?

31:25.875 --> 31:27.416
Daughter's
fucking teachers again.

31:27.458 --> 31:28.541
Hang on.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.541
What's she done now?

31:31.583 --> 31:33.041
But I didn't touch her, did I?

31:33.083 --> 31:34.500
You chased her.
She slipped and fell.

31:34.541 --> 31:36.041
Why the fuck
did you chase the girl?

31:36.083 --> 31:37.708
It was her fault!
She was too rude.

31:37.750 --> 31:39.666
Mr. Frank said this is
the last time, the last.

31:39.708 --> 31:41.541
Do you know what that means?
One more strike and you're done.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.458
But I didn't do
anything, she started it.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.083
Nish, you better pipe down,
hon, I swear to God, Nish.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.000
If you get expelled,
I'm fucking-- That's it.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.791
Do you know how much
I've had to sacrifice for you?

31:49.833 --> 31:51.625
I asked you
to sacrifice nothing.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.625
Can you just shut your mouth?
I'm not even joking.

31:53.666 --> 31:55.708
You think I'm working like a dog
to keep a roof over your head

31:55.750 --> 31:57.291
for you to put
the stress on my back?

What are you doing?

34:03.708 --> 34:04.791
Uh...

34:06.041 --> 34:07.125

34:09.416 --> 34:12.125
I was just... messing about.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.041
Gonna show you later.

34:16.291 --> 34:17.750
You were gonna show me later?

34:18.958 --> 34:20.041
Yeah.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.041
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- Taking a picture.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.875
- No, no!
- Why? You said you were messing!

34:29.916 --> 34:31.541
- Give me the phone.
- Travis, give me my phone back.

34:31.583 --> 34:33.083
- Give me the phone!
- Travis. Travis.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.500
- Give me my phone.
- Give me the phone

34:34.541 --> 34:37.166
Give me my phone!
Travis! Travis!

34:37.208 --> 34:39.208
- Hey. In a minute!
- Give me my phone.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.541
- What the fuck?
- Oh. Nish!

34:41.583 --> 34:43.750
- It's nothing.
- Why are you in Mum's dress for?

34:43.791 --> 34:44.958
Kenisha,
leave us alone a minute.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.541
Why are you in Mum's--

34:46.583 --> 34:47.750
Kenisha,
leave the room, please.

34:47.791 --> 34:48.958
Why are you in Mum's dress for?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.416
Kenisha,
I said leave us. Get out now!

34:57.291 --> 34:58.458
Okay, let me just...

35:00.166 --> 35:01.250
let me just...

35:07.916 --> 35:09.000

35:12.166 --> 35:13.250

35:17.125 --> 35:18.208
I was...

35:20.458 --> 35:22.875
I wanted to put it on,
like, messing about.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.958
To surprise you later.

35:29.041 --> 35:30.625

you're not telling me here?

35:30.666 --> 35:31.833
No.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.291
No!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.250
Travis, you're wearing
my makeup and my dress

35:36.291 --> 35:38.500
- and dancing around like a--
- What?

35:39.583 --> 35:41.333
Are you, like,

35:41.375 --> 35:42.916
harboring some kind of
feelings about something?

35:42.958 --> 35:44.500
- Babes, listen, no!
- Are you into it?

35:44.541 --> 35:46.166
- No! No, no, all right?
- Travis, you're--

35:46.208 --> 35:48.500
you're whining like
a ladyboy in my dress.

35:48.541 --> 35:49.875
What the fuck
are you chatting about?

35:49.916 --> 35:51.458
What am I chatting about?

35:53.208 --> 35:54.666
You're wearing my fucking dress.

35:56.625 --> 35:57.708
So what, then?

35:59.833 --> 36:02.375
Right. Can you just--
can you just take it off?

36:02.416 --> 36:04.000
'Cause we need
to talk seriously,

36:04.041 --> 36:05.375
- and you are stretching it.
- All right!

36:07.500 --> 36:09.958
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck!

36:13.125 --> 36:15.291
Candy, man!

36:15.333 --> 36:17.333

36:23.500 --> 36:25.000

all right?

36:28.500 --> 36:29.583
I'm being silly.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.500
Put the dress on
'cause I wanted to see

36:32.541 --> 36:33.916
if I could look as good as you.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.708
- And my knickers?

and try 'em on?

36:40.750 --> 36:41.791
All right, look, all right.

36:43.458 --> 36:45.625

36:46.791 --> 36:48.541
Hello?

36:48.583 --> 36:51.458
I was bored, and I felt like
being stupid, all right?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.791
One sec.
Mum, Donna's on the phone.

36:54.833 --> 36:57.125
- Take it off.
- All right, cool.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.708
- Mum?
- Cool.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.041
- Hello?
- I'm playing.

37:01.083 --> 37:04.458
You know me.
I'm fucking crazy, innit?

37:06.166 --> 37:07.833
You know, I was--

37:07.875 --> 37:10.000
I was gonna jump out at you, yeah?

37:10.041 --> 37:11.250
When you came back, and...

37:14.833 --> 37:16.250
What do you think?
Think I look good, though?

37:16.291 --> 37:18.125
- Take it off.
- All right!

37:18.166 --> 37:20.583
- Take it off.
- I'm getting it off! Look!

37:23.666 --> 37:24.916

37:26.125 --> 37:29.333
You wait there,

We're not done.

38:17.375 --> 38:19.208
Hey, pass the ball.
You're rubbish, bro!

38:26.583 --> 38:28.166
Hey, you mans.

38:28.208 --> 38:30.208

38:30.250 --> 38:32.500
Hey, bro, bro!

38:38.708 --> 38:39.791
Yesterday...

38:40.916 --> 38:42.000
I was...

38:44.750 --> 38:46.000
It isn't what you think,
all right?

38:47.333 --> 38:49.458
I was smoking a lot of buds.

38:50.791 --> 38:51.833
It was a joke.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.875
Hey, ain't that deep.
You hear what I said?

38:57.750 --> 38:58.833
Have you done it before?

39:01.416 --> 39:02.500
Nah.

39:03.958 --> 39:05.375
Just a likkle prank.

He's all right.

What?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.500
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.583
Shh! Trav!

40:36.500 --> 40:37.875
Just wanna ask you something.

40:43.250 --> 40:45.083
Do you think you were
born in the wrong body?

40:45.125 --> 40:46.625
- Do you think you were, like--
- I told you yesterday.

40:46.666 --> 40:48.041
I'm asking you to be honest.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.166
What did I say?

40:50.250 --> 40:51.333
Travis, look...

40:53.041 --> 40:54.125
I know you're a bit...

40:55.500 --> 40:56.958
different.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.625
Like I'm a bit different.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.083
You know me,
I'm like a free spirit.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.125
I like to play,
but, like, fantasy, yeah?

41:05.083 --> 41:07.125
Fantasy to me is not reality.

41:07.166 --> 41:08.708
Do you know what I mean?

41:08.750 --> 41:10.083
Fantasy is fantasy, innit?

41:11.041 --> 41:13.000
And you know I like
to have fun, but...

41:14.458 --> 41:15.833
I like it as fantasy.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.375
Does that make sense?

41:21.625 --> 41:22.708
Told you.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.625
It was...

41:27.500 --> 41:30.083

49:56.041 --> 49:57.541
- What's this?
- Whoa, whoa, you all right?

49:57.583 --> 49:58.666
What's wrong?

50:00.125 --> 50:02.125
- I don't know what it is.
- Am I a prick to you?

50:02.166 --> 50:03.708
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong?

50:03.750 --> 50:05.458
Kenisha,
leave us alone, please.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.875
What's-- what's wrong?

50:06.916 --> 50:08.375
Your dad thinks
I'm a fucking mug.

50:08.416 --> 50:10.000
Babe,
I didn't do nothing.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.833
- This is nothing, is it?
- You're fucking mad.

50:11.875 --> 50:14.125
- You're a fucking liar. A liar!
- Calm down, it was me.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.958
I borrowed it earlier.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.333
Sorry.
I didn't realize I broke it.

50:23.291 --> 50:24.833
Kenisha,
do you know how much this costs?

50:26.125 --> 50:27.333
Apologize to your dad.

50:31.083 --> 50:32.166
I'm sorry.

50:33.083 --> 50:34.458
I needed this for tomorrow.

50:35.666 --> 50:38.291
I know,
but I wanted to try it on

50:38.333 --> 50:41.166
because you said
Reggie wouldn't like my clothes.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.291
All right, Nish. Just...

50:48.250 --> 50:49.333
leave us alone a minute.

50:58.666 --> 50:59.916
I'm so sorry, baby.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.083
I'm sorry.

51:13.625 --> 51:14.791
Vivian Aforé?

51:26.291 --> 51:28.833
Okay, this is gonna sound weird,
yeah, but...

51:28.875 --> 51:31.000
...I think
your dad is proper sexy.

51:32.083 --> 51:33.458
Like, you can't deny it.

51:33.500 --> 51:34.916
Your mum and dad
are buff, though.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.708
How do you think
you turned out so peng?

51:36.750 --> 51:39.666
Stop perving on my family, bruv.

51:39.708 --> 51:41.416
Should only be
thinking of Bradley.

51:41.458 --> 51:44.333
Fam, I'm so done
with that wasteman.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.208
But you like mandem, right?

51:46.250 --> 51:47.958
I don't like the way
he was acting all bad.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I like sensitive boys,

51:50.041 --> 51:52.291
boys that aren't afraid
of expressing themselves.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.250
You get me?

51:56.250 --> 51:57.333
Mmm.

51:58.333 --> 52:00.250
Yeah, my dad's kinda like that.

52:00.291 --> 52:02.291
Like, he don't play,

52:02.333 --> 52:04.666
but he's, like,
sensitive as well.

52:04.708 --> 52:07.833
- Hmm, really?
- Shut up, bruv.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.041
How is he sensitive?

52:11.291 --> 52:12.375
What?

52:14.166 --> 52:15.791
You can't tell no one.

52:15.833 --> 52:17.250
Tell me.

52:18.625 --> 52:20.625
Okay. Um...

52:21.708 --> 52:24.166
well, sometimes...

52:25.375 --> 52:28.291
he likes to dress in
my mum's clothes.

52:28.333 --> 52:30.708
- Oh, wow.
- Shut up, man.

52:30.750 --> 52:33.833
Wait, wait.
Like <i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

52:33.875 --> 52:35.541
Hmm?

52:35.583 --> 52:37.250
I don't know, like,

52:37.291 --> 52:39.458
he just likes to wear
her clothes sometimes.

52:39.500 --> 52:42.750
But he says he's pranking,
but I don't know.

52:44.375 --> 52:45.916
That's.

52:46.958 --> 52:50.208
I think that's kind of like this
box that society puts us in,

52:50.250 --> 52:52.375
and your dad said,
"Fuck that box."

52:53.208 --> 52:54.291
It's pretty hot.

52:55.833 --> 52:57.625
Can't tell no one.

52:57.666 --> 52:59.666
I promise. I swear on my life.

53:03.250 --> 53:05.083
I saw you watching me.

53:05.125 --> 53:06.833
I really like the way
you girls dance.

53:06.875 --> 53:07.958
Is that so?

53:14.166 --> 53:17.458
Ladies, our friend over here
wants to know how you pony.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.166
Lovely job. Well done, you two.

53:20.208 --> 53:22.541
That was great. Thanks, Candice.

53:22.583 --> 53:25.583
- How'd that feel?
- Yeah. Felt good.

53:25.625 --> 53:26.958
Danny, we'll grab you in five.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.666
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Danny.

53:33.750 --> 53:36.291
Shaun, sorry about the song.
My voice is a bit strained.

53:37.583 --> 53:39.875
You know how many shows you'd do
in a week if you got the job?

53:40.791 --> 53:43.166
- Six.
- Yes.

53:43.208 --> 53:45.333
Sometimes two on Saturdays.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.625
That's seven. See what I mean?

53:48.958 --> 53:50.875
No room for a strained voice.

53:52.041 --> 53:54.000
I know how to
take care of myself--

53:54.041 --> 53:56.791
Tina Turner was an athlete.
These roles are for athletes.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.791
Athletes in training.

53:58.833 --> 54:01.375
It'd take all your focus.
There'd be no time for any...

54:02.750 --> 54:04.708
any distractions.

54:04.750 --> 54:05.916
Shaun, honestly, I don't know
why you're telling me this.

54:05.958 --> 54:07.333
I know. Don't you think I know?

54:09.250 --> 54:10.291
Well, great.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.250
Thanks for coming in.

54:18.041 --> 54:19.416
I'd love for you
to come in again.

54:20.250 --> 54:21.750
Do you think you can
come back on Friday?

54:22.916 --> 54:24.791
Yes. Definitely.

54:24.833 --> 54:27.083
Yes. Thank you.

54:28.750 --> 54:31.250
Thank you.

54:31.291 --> 54:33.083
He wants you back, though?

54:33.125 --> 54:34.541
Yeah, but
they'll have me in eight times

54:34.583 --> 54:36.083
and then tell me
they don't want me.

54:36.125 --> 54:37.875
He literally said
he wants you back.

54:37.916 --> 54:39.333
Yeah, but it doesn't always
work that way, does it?

54:39.375 --> 54:40.708
You need to chill.

54:40.750 --> 54:42.166
Hold on a second. Is that...

54:43.833 --> 54:44.916
What?

54:46.041 --> 54:47.541
- What?
- It's Nish.

54:48.500 --> 54:49.583
Wait. Hey!

54:53.291 --> 54:54.625
- Kenisha.
- Oh, my God.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.625
- Come with me.
- No.

54:56.666 --> 54:58.291
So that's Reggie, yeah?

54:58.333 --> 55:00.250
- You're Reggie, are ya?
- Who's Reggie?

55:00.291 --> 55:02.458
Reggie is a boy
my daughter told me she liked.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.166
Which is hilarious,
'cause it seems to me

55:04.208 --> 55:06.041
he's now a lesbian.

55:06.083 --> 55:07.708
So I'm just wondering,
what happened to Reggie, hmm?

55:07.750 --> 55:09.708
But don't you worry.
I'm used to it now.

55:09.750 --> 55:11.416
It's fucking colors
of the rainbow in my family.

55:11.458 --> 55:13.416
- Kenisha, let's go. Now.
- Just shut up!

55:13.458 --> 55:14.708
Who do you think
you're talking to?

55:14.750 --> 55:16.500
- Come with me, now.
- No!

55:16.541 --> 55:18.583
Kenisha, get your arse
in the fucking car now!

55:18.625 --> 55:20.250
- Hey, calm down!
- Kenisha!

55:20.291 --> 55:21.708
- I fucking hate you!
- Nish!

55:22.500 --> 55:24.958
Um,
I think I'm just gonna...

55:31.833 --> 55:33.500
Can't stop her
liking who she likes.

55:33.541 --> 55:35.166
Who's trying to stop her?

55:35.208 --> 55:36.958
She made up this whole
elaborate fucking thing

55:37.000 --> 55:38.541
- about a boy called Reggie.
- I'm saying she probably

55:38.583 --> 55:40.291
don't feel like
she can be real with you.

55:40.333 --> 55:42.125
What you mean,
she can't be real with me?

55:42.166 --> 55:43.916
Did I say she couldn't
like who she likes?

55:43.958 --> 55:46.166
You probably made her feel
like she couldn't say.

55:46.208 --> 55:48.708
- I don't know!
- And who are you right now?

55:48.750 --> 55:50.916
Oprah, yeah? And I'm the devil.

55:50.958 --> 55:52.791
Have you thought about how
you might be influencing her--

55:52.833 --> 55:54.708
Hey, I ain't influencing no one!

55:54.750 --> 55:57.208
- You make me laugh.
- Seriously, shut up, Candice!

56:01.708 --> 56:03.625
Do you know
how worried we've been?

56:03.666 --> 56:04.833
Like you care.

56:04.875 --> 56:06.958
Look, Nish, I'm sorry.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.083
I just...

56:09.541 --> 56:11.833
I don't like
that you lied to me.

56:11.875 --> 56:13.166
There's too much lying going on.

56:15.083 --> 56:16.416
Is this funny, yeah?

56:19.041 --> 56:20.333
Why'd you break my dress?

56:23.083 --> 56:24.333
You did it on purpose,
didn't you?

56:26.541 --> 56:27.708
You did, didn't you?

56:29.250 --> 56:30.333
Wow.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.416
You ungrateful bitch.

56:34.250 --> 56:35.958
Do you know where I'd be
if it weren't for you?

56:39.916 --> 56:41.666
Shouldn't have had me,
then, should you?

57:12.916 --> 57:14.791
- Baby.
- Mm?

57:14.833 --> 57:16.333
Thank you for fixing the dress.

57:25.125 --> 57:27.666
Travis,
I'm not sure about all of this.

57:27.708 --> 57:29.291
I don't know if I'm good enough.

57:33.125 --> 57:34.208
What?

57:42.250 --> 57:43.375
I was just thinking about...

57:44.916 --> 57:46.916
the first time I heard you
singing at.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.041
I looked at you,
and I thought...

57:51.791 --> 57:52.875
"She's mine."

57:54.416 --> 57:56.375
Thought we were gonna be
Jay-Z and Beyoncé, didn't we?

58:00.125 --> 58:01.708
I had fuckin' goosebumps.

58:10.583 --> 58:11.916
You would've never
asked me that.

58:13.875 --> 58:14.958
What's goin' on?

58:15.791 --> 58:16.875
Hmm?

58:20.666 --> 58:22.541
Need to get
the old confidence back.

58:53.291 --> 58:54.583
I wanna see you in it again.

58:59.375 --> 59:00.458
Please.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.000
<i>Miss Vaush.
I thought you might stay longer.</i>

01:00:57.916 --> 01:01:00.291
<i>We can't always
trust our thoughts, honey.</i>

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:04.208
<i>The way I see it...</i>

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.583
- Thought you was revising?
- I'm taking a break.

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:15.208
<i>Sometimes I'll
say goodbye before the finish.</i>

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.791
<i>Leave him wanting more.</i>

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:19.000
I'm trying to watch this.

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:21.625
<i>Well, I must say,
you were sensational tonight.</i>

01:01:21.666 --> 01:01:23.916
<i>I mean, just sensational!</i>

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:26.541
Last night was a one-off.

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:29.916
We ain't doing that again.

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:35.291
<i>Mr. Flynn,
it's been a wonderful evening.</i>

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:39.958
Remember who wanted it?

01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:47.666
Well, maybe you should've
been more assertive

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:48.958
if you feel that strongly.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.666
You could've told me no.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.583
I don't own you.

01:01:56.916 --> 01:01:58.041
Anyways, I'm just saying.

01:01:58.083 --> 01:01:59.250
Don't think we're
making that a habit.

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:33.750
What I've been telling you
about fire and safety?

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:36.708
Yeah, sorry about that.
I forgot about that.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.708
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:43.166
I can't reset the end of the
wires, Friday.

01:02:43.208 --> 01:02:44.666
- Friday?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:46.583
- Friday?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:49.500
But he's got a number
he can give you.

01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:50.958
All right, give me the number.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.916
.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:54.083
Yeah.

01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:00.416
Oh, fuck! Fuck.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.666
Fuck, man.

01:03:02.708 --> 01:03:04.416
The fuck's going on?

01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:06.125
Oh, don't worry, man.

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.291
It's nothing.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.083
What?

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.500
Nothing.

01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:19.416
I just thought you stopped all
that shit when you was a kid.

01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:22.500
They Candy's?

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:25.458
They Candy's, innit?

01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:28.458
Hey, don't worry, bro.

01:03:29.666 --> 01:03:31.875
You know your secret's
always been safe with me, and--

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:35.041
Oi! That's coming out
of your fuckin' wages!

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:36.500
Do I give a fuck?

01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:39.041
You know what?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:41.458
You've always been
an ungrateful little brat.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.416
Fuckin' Mum fussing over you
all the time

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:47.666
and I'm the one, again,
cleaning up your mess.

01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:49.666
Yeah. All right.
All right. All right.

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:52.875
Easy.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.583
I'm just trying to find out...

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.958
what's going on
in that freaky little head.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.250
That's it. 'Cause you know
you ain't acting normal, right?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.458
What? A man-- a man
sees his little brother

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.875
just out of prison and wearing
his girl's knickers. What--

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:06.375
- Don't--
- ...can't ask what--

01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:08.375
All right, bro. All right. Okay.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:10.958
- Move the-- move out my way.
- Bro. Bro. All right, my bad.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.625
My bad.

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:17.291
I just need you to act
like a responsible man.

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.250
Don't you think
your lady deserves that?

01:04:21.916 --> 01:04:23.000
You know she does.

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:26.916
And what I do need you
to think about

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.750
is who the fuck
you're working for.

01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:34.041
If you don't wanna do that...

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:36.958
you know where the door is.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.208
Don't you?

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:07.166
Oi, dickhead.
Why didn't you text me back?

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:08.666
What are you
always hitting me for?

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:09.875
Because you're wet.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.083
What?

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:15.708
All right, Ben,
tell her what they said to me.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.291
- Bennett, tell her, man.
- Okay, all right.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.208
Basically we heard
that Mad T is actually gay

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:24.791
- and turned into a female.
- Who said that?

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.458
Cecily and Malcolm.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.625
Ay, yo,
why are you snitching, man?

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:30.291
Why is she spreading shit?

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.083
That's fuckin' dumb.

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:34.041
- That's why he went in jail.
- Did he even go to jail?

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.166
- Why would I lie about that?
- Because my man's a pervert.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:38.083
Man, she's a pervert?

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.875
You better shut the fuck up
about my dad.

01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.375
Ay, yo, calm down, man.

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:42.875
What we're trying to say
is that,

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:44.500
that's why he likes prison, innit?

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.291
'cause, like, in prison
men like getting their--

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.500
you know, their dicks sucked
by she-males--

01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:04.125
Yeah?

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.625
Uh, no, but you can speak to me.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:13.458
I'm Travis Clark, her dad.

01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:16.708
What's happened?

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:21.375
Hey! Why are you always
moving mad for?

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:22.916
Do you wanna
tell your mum about this?

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.625
- I don't care.
- What did I tell you?

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.416
I told you to keep
your head down, didn't I?

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:27.875
It's your fucking fault.

01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:29.875
What'd you say? Oi.

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:31.541
They were laughing about you.

01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:33.291
How come they were laughing
about me? Hey!

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.750
They were calling you gay.
What do you expect?

01:07:35.791 --> 01:07:38.916
What are they
calling me gay for? Hmm?

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:41.750
I told my friend that
you were wearing mum's dress.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.916
What did you say that for?

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.791
She promised not to tell no one.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:47.791
It was a fucking joke, Kenisha.
I told you I was pranking!

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.666
You're not joking because you've
done it before. Just stop lying!

01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:53.625
Hey, Nish, Nish, Nish, Nish!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:54.916
You're right. Okay?

01:07:56.125 --> 01:07:57.208
You're right.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:07:59.666
And that's my fault.

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:03.541
I'm sorry.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.208
Listen.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.250
We'll keep this one quiet
for a minute, yeah?

01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:19.500
Your mum, she got enough stress
right now with her audition.

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:22.541
I don't give a shit
about her stress.

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:24.375
Oi, when you suddenly think

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:26.416
it's okay
to just swear all the time?

01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:27.708
You're always swearing.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.333
Yeah, 'cause I'm an adult.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.291
Hey.

01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:34.875
You ain't supposed to swear
in front of adults.

01:08:42.083 --> 01:08:43.333
Dad?

01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:45.541
Hmm?

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:48.375
You know, if you're gay,

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.875
you really should
break up with Mum.

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:51.125
What is this about me being gay?

01:08:51.916 --> 01:08:53.166
Huh? Why am I gay?

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:58.625
A friend said that some men
turn, like, women in prison--

01:08:58.666 --> 01:08:59.916
Fucking no.

01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.625
All right?

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:05.583
No.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.291
Don't know why they were
calling me gay for

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.083
and you're the one
who's fucking gay, not me.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.083
But why though?

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:25.291
I don't know what's going on,
you know, and...

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:29.416
I just like being pretty sometimes.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.666
And that's it.

01:09:34.458 --> 01:09:37.250
What? Don't you think
that's a bit off-key?

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:38.708
I'm not saying it's not.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.833
Maybe I'm just
a bit off-key, innit?

01:09:47.208 --> 01:09:48.500
I am too.

01:09:51.583 --> 01:09:53.208
A bit?

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.958
Right, you're more
than a bit, mate.

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:06.958
I wanna
show you something.

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:12.666
Come
and show it off at school.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.083
No, don't do that.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.958
I'll show you what I got.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.208
- Never do that.
- Where you been?

01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:20.583
I took her to Nando's, innit?

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:26.791
- Oi.
- Hmm?

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.208
- How was school?
- It was good.

01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:32.791
Good.

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.375
I'm not watching the news.

01:10:34.416 --> 01:10:35.250
- You're watching the news.
- Trav.

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:38.958
Deb called about the party
for Clive on Saturday.

01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:42.583
I said we'd go.

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.708
I know you both don't wanna go,
but I think we should.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:46.416
I want us all
to do something normal,

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:47.750
all-together, like a family.

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:51.541
Cool.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.625
Be nice to see grandma, innit?

01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:56.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:56.916 --> 01:10:58.333
Yeah.

01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:00.708
Good.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.333
Um, I'm going to school now.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:49.625
We'll give you a lift.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:56.000
Um, I'm getting
a lift from Addy.

01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:58.041
- Okay.
- Good luck.

01:11:58.083 --> 01:11:59.166
Thanks, babe.

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:00.291
Nish.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:03.583
Give me a hug.

01:12:11.541 --> 01:12:12.958
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:24.708
She took it down.

01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:08.958
Look who it is.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.333
How are you, my little cherub?

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:12.875
Hi!

01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:18.291
I'm so glad you're out.

01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:19.750
You look good.

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:21.375
Please make sure
you look after yourself.

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:24.583
- Doesn't she shut up?
- How you doing?

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:27.333
Like that, is it?

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:28.625
Cheers.

01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.208
- Come, let's go.
- All right.

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.666
Your brother's gonna be here
any minute.

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.750
And as soon as he comes in,
we're all gonna make some noise.

01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:47.458
Oi, none of that, please.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.541
Why are we acting
like it's a surprise party

01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:51.000
when he knows about it?

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.583
Will you tell your dad
to behave?

01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:54.458
What's going on, brother?

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.250
- Maji! You all right, man?
- What's happening, family?

01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:57.958
You all right, yeah?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.125

Hey, hey.

Oh, looking sharp, bro.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.583
Yeah, a little bit
of effort in that.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:42.208
- I like it, I like it.
- Happy birthday, man.

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:44.458
Yo, what's this, fam, hmm?

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:49.166
Oh, bro.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:50.750
You know I could get
about five of these

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.166
for the price of one, right?

01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:54.375
Yeah. All right,
give it back then.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:57.458
No, bro, chill, chill, chill.
I'm joking. Come on.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.250
- Come on, I appreciate it.
- Hmm.

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:00.541
Hey, I'm glad you're here, innit.

01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:02.791
Hey, glad you're here.

01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:05.041
- Come here, bro.
- We cool?

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:10.375

yourself trespassing

I can shout

01:28:32.625 --> 01:28:34.583

you need to stop shouting

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:36.500

01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.083

- Babe, just stop--

01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.541
Arrest me for telling you
you can't come in my house?

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:43.333
I should have you
fucking arrested.

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:44.916
- Right, you're making a mi--
- Take your hands off me!

01:28:44.958 --> 01:28:46.708
- Wait! No!
- Okay, okay. Stay back, sir.

01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:47.916
Now I'm arresting you
for assaulting an officer.

01:28:47.958 --> 01:28:49.708
You don't have to say anything,

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:51.625
but it may harm your defense
if you don't mention

01:28:51.666 --> 01:28:53.083
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:54.833
Anything you do say
may be given...

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:18.125
It's Paul.

01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:24.666
Your agent.

01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:31.958
Do you not wanna know
what's going on?

01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:37.208
Pass me the phone.

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:21.666
I didn't get it.

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:32.666
You all right?

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:36.541
Yeah.

01:30:38.333 --> 01:30:39.416
Wasn't meant to be.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.083
- I want you to take it.
- You do?

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:17.125
- I don't need it now, do I?
- I got it for you.

01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:20.416
But you look better in it.

01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:45.333
I'm a big woman, innit?

01:31:46.458 --> 01:31:48.166
Time for me
to stop being someone I'm not.

01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:16.625
- Look where you're going, bro.
- The fuck!

01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:18.958
- What?
- What?

01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:26.208
- Come, then!
- Fuck off, man.

01:32:40.791 --> 01:32:41.875
Nisha.

01:32:49.416 --> 01:32:51.083
Your dad's gone to stay
with Victor for a while.

01:32:53.041 --> 01:32:54.166
When's he coming back?

01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:57.375
I don't know.

01:32:58.708 --> 01:33:00.000
We just need some space.

01:33:05.708 --> 01:33:07.416
I just came to say
I'm sorry, babe,

01:33:07.458 --> 01:33:08.541
for what I said.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.375
It was horrible of me
and not true.

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:16.875
I've been a shit mum
and I'm gonna do better.

01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:21.458
I'll call up to school
and I'll explain

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.583
we've had some shit going on.

01:33:23.708 --> 01:33:25.375
What?

01:33:25.416 --> 01:33:26.500
Why are you pulling that face?

01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:29.583
I don't wanna go back to school.

01:33:29.625 --> 01:33:30.708
Why not?

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:34.166
No one likes me.

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:36.000
Oh, come on,
they all love you up there.

01:33:36.041 --> 01:33:37.166
No, they don't.

01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:42.250
I told Cicely that
Dad was wearing your dress

01:33:42.291 --> 01:33:44.666
and she told everyone
that he's gay and a she-male.

01:33:45.666 --> 01:33:47.125
Is Cecily the one you were--

01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:52.041
She said that after you--
Nah.

01:33:53.666 --> 01:33:54.875
Didn't like her from the off.

01:33:56.708 --> 01:33:58.083
Them stush pretty girls

01:33:58.125 --> 01:33:59.291
will eat you up
and spit you out.

01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:14.375
Why did you make Dad leave?

01:34:15.375 --> 01:34:17.416
Babe, he was not behaving
like he should.

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:18.750
It's a lot of things.

01:34:19.791 --> 01:34:22.916
No. I don't get it.

01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:25.500
He is off-key. You're off-key.

01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:27.125
So why can't you guys
just deal with it?

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.708
- Like, what's your issue?
Nisha.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.333
You just don't worry
about us, okay?

01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:17.375
Yo, yo, yo.

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:51.375
Yo. What's winding, bro?

01:35:51.416 --> 01:35:53.291
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:58.458
What, it looks funny?
What, I look funny, huh?

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.583
Yeah, you do look funny, bro.
Hey, get off me, man.

01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:04.000
Hey, relax. The fuck is wrong
with you, Travis, man?

01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:06.208
Whoa. You all right?

01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:08.333
- What's wrong?
- You need to move, bro.

01:36:08.375 --> 01:36:10.333
- What's wrong, bro?
- You're gay, man.

01:36:10.375 --> 01:36:13.375
- You think I'm joking?
- You know what, bro?

01:36:13.416 --> 01:36:15.958
I don't give a fuck.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.666
Yeah?

01:36:17.708 --> 01:36:19.375
- Hey, chill out Travis.
- You see this?

01:36:19.416 --> 01:36:22.333
- Bruv, bruv, bruv--
- This feels light.

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:24.958
Talking about light and shit.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.833
Get out of my face, man.

01:36:26.875 --> 01:36:29.458
You see this?
This is free, bruv.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.791
- Yo!
- Hey, back the fuck off!

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:34.000
You fucking dumb
or something?

01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:35.458
Are you playing games?
Stop playing games.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.333
Trav, I told you
stop playing games.

01:36:38.166 --> 01:36:39.916
We're all playing, bro.

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:42.333
- We're all fucking played.
- Hey, relax, man.

01:36:42.375 --> 01:36:45.250
All of you men
are fucking played.

01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:47.291
Are you all right, bro?

01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:51.083
All right. Bro. I'm calm, man.

01:36:51.125 --> 01:36:52.416
Calm yourself.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:55.041
Yeah?

01:36:56.166 --> 01:36:57.291
I'm a star.

01:36:58.375 --> 01:36:59.666
Bro.

01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:18.958
Hey, let him down, let him down!

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.916
You're fuckin' sick!

01:37:20.958 --> 01:37:22.916
Get to the floor, boy, you mad?
What's wrong with you, man?

01:37:22.958 --> 01:37:25.125
Turn around!
What's wrong with you, man?

01:37:25.166 --> 01:37:26.458
Boy, you stayin' down!

01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:29.791

All right? Hey.

01:39:14.458 --> 01:39:17.541
- What happened to your face?
- Don't worry about it.

01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:19.500
I'm fine. You all right?

01:39:19.541 --> 01:39:20.750

- I'll see you in a minute, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39:29.916 --> 01:39:33.208
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
Uh, I just come from probation.

01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.708
Oh, hey, Travis. We were just--

01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:36.666
Uh, wait, Mr. Frank,
Mr. Frank, um...

01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:39.791
You know what?
This is all my fault.

01:39:41.541 --> 01:39:43.291
- Look--
- Um, that boy that--

01:39:44.458 --> 01:39:45.583
That boy should be punished.

01:39:46.708 --> 01:39:48.833
He was taking the piss
out of me 'cause...

01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:53.791
I'm just a bit crazy, some--

01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:56.416
Not crazy, like...

01:39:58.458 --> 01:40:00.208
I express myself differently...

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:03.166
in women's clothes.

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:07.833
But apparently them lot
found out and was calling me gay

01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:10.333
and she was just sticking up
for her dad, you know?

01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:14.791
You know, I just come out
of jail a few weeks back, right?

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:16.333
You know that, yeah? Yeah.

01:40:17.833 --> 01:40:19.833
See, this is all my fault.

01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:21.750
- Travis--
- It's my fault.

01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:25.000
- Mr-- Mr. Clark, we just--
- Please, sir, I promise you.

01:40:26.916 --> 01:40:28.375
I'll give my life to make sure

01:40:28.416 --> 01:40:29.666
she don't get
in no more trouble.

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.208
That's my girl.

01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:35.000
All my life.

01:40:36.583 --> 01:40:38.541
Please just give her
one more chance.

01:40:40.583 --> 01:40:41.666
Thank you, Travis.

01:40:43.708 --> 01:40:45.666
Miss May has explained
quite a lot.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:49.708
It's good news.

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:54.625
The governors have agreed
to give her one more chance

01:40:54.666 --> 01:40:56.541
under the condition

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.083
that she sees our counselor
twice a week.

01:41:01.791 --> 01:41:04.125
- Come here.
- Yeah.

01:41:56.625 --> 01:41:57.916
We've got a name
for the band now.

01:42:00.291 --> 01:42:02.333
Candy and the Summits.

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:06.875
What?

01:42:08.958 --> 01:42:10.083
Does it sound stupid?

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.958
- Candy and the Summits?
- Mm-hmm.

01:42:19.458 --> 01:42:20.583
No, I like it.

01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:23.541
I like it.

01:42:28.333 --> 01:42:30.250
You know, I was thinking though.

01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:32.458
What? What were you thinking?

01:42:37.708 --> 01:42:39.208
I was thinking...

01:42:41.416 --> 01:42:43.166
maybe it's time for us
to get married.

01:42:47.708 --> 01:42:48.791
What?

01:42:51.125 --> 01:42:53.250
You don't wanna marry me?

01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:55.916
No.

01:43:25.291 --> 01:43:26.916
Go on.

01:43:27.958 --> 01:43:29.083
Vic's waiting for you.

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.125

- Yeah, yeah, now slide it.

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:45.166
