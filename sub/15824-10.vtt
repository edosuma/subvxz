00:01.169 --> 00:02.503
Judge Blake: SUPERIOR COURT
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

00:02.536 --> 00:04.305
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.340
THE FAMILY OF TURELL BAYLOR
vs. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES,

00:06.374 --> 00:09.077
LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.378
MAYOR RAMON QUINTERO,

00:10.411 --> 00:12.346
INTERIM CHIEF OF POLICE
WILLIAM POPE,

00:12.380 --> 00:14.348
DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON,

00:14.382 --> 00:15.616
THE MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION

00:15.649 --> 00:17.685
OF THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:17.718 --> 00:19.387
AND SEVERAL JOHN DOES.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.490
CASE NUMBER 0-5-C-C-0-1-3-1.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.492
JUDGE GERALD BLAKE PRESIDING.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.328
STATE YOUR APPEARANCES
FOR THE RECORD.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.797
PETER GOLDMAN APPEARING FOR
THE PLAINTIFF, YOUR HONOR.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.699
GAVIN Q. BAKER
AND CITY ATTORNEY LEE

00:31.732 --> 00:33.301
FOR THE DEFENSE,
YOUR HONOR.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.836
I HAVE READ THE DEFENSE'S MOTION

00:35.869 --> 00:37.305
FOR A SUMMARY JUDGMENT

00:37.338 --> 00:39.407
AND THE PAPERS FILED
IN OPPOSITION.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.642
I THINK
THERE VERY WELL MIGHT BE

00:41.675 --> 00:44.345
SOME TRIABLE ISSUES
OF MATERIAL FACT.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.817
Gavin: YES. YOUR HONOR,
I ASK YOU TO LOOK AT PAGE SIX

00:49.850 --> 00:52.486
OF MR. GOLDMAN'S PLEADING,
WHERE HE STATES,

00:52.520 --> 00:57.258
"TURELL BAYLOR WAS MURDERED
BY PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN."

00:57.291 --> 00:59.793
DEFENSE REGARDS THIS AS
AN ADMISSION AGAINST INTEREST.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.263
IF COUNSEL HAS NO IDEA
WHO KILLED MR. BAYLOR,

01:02.296 --> 01:03.297
HOW DO WE PROCEED?

01:08.536 --> 01:11.239
YOUR HONOR,

01:11.272 --> 01:14.308
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON
ABANDONED TURELL BAYLOR

01:14.342 --> 01:15.843
IN GANG TERRITORY,

01:15.876 --> 01:18.812
WHERE HIS FELLOW CRIPS
WERE MASSING TO EXECUTE HIM.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.481
EXCUSE ME, YOUR HONOR.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.217
CHIEF JOHNSON DROPPED MR. BAYLOR
OFF AT HIS HOUSE,

01:23.251 --> 01:24.385
WHERE HE REQUESTED TO GO.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.719
IT'S NOT
THE DEFENDANT'S FAULT

01:25.753 --> 01:27.821
THAT MR. BAYLOR LIVED
IN GANG TERRITORY.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.757
YOUR HONOR,
EVERYONE KNOWS

01:29.790 --> 01:31.359
TURELL BAYLOR WAS MURDERED
BY MEMBERS OF HIS OWN GANG.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.860
YOUR HONOR,
IF EVERYONE KNOWS THIS,

01:32.893 --> 01:34.462
WHY HAS COUNSEL
SUBMITTED NO EVIDENCE

01:34.495 --> 01:36.130
SUBSTANTIATING THIS FACT?

01:36.164 --> 01:37.898
INSTEAD, HE ASKS THE COURT
TO TRY HIS OPINION --

01:37.931 --> 01:40.534
AN IMPROPER USE
OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.271
EVEN IF ONE WERE TO ACCEPT
THAT IN THIS INSTANCE

01:43.304 --> 01:44.705
THE WARREN RULE
DID NOT APPLY.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.307
THE WARREN RULE
WOULD ONLY APPLY

01:46.340 --> 01:49.177
IF CHIEF JOHNSON
HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.844
SHE WASN'T NEGLIGENT.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.781
SHE ACTIVELY FACILITATED
THE MURDER OF TURELL BAYLOR.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.449
THIS MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

01:55.483 --> 01:58.486
IS A FEEBLE EXCUSE TO GET
THAT CHARGE TO JUST GO AWAY.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.222
I CONGRATULATE COUNSEL
ON SO SWIFTLY

02:01.255 --> 02:02.623
DIVIDING
BOTH OUR OBJECTIVE

02:02.656 --> 02:05.893
AND THE DEFINITION
OF A SUMMARY JUDGMENT,

02:05.926 --> 02:08.696
WHICH IS TO IMMEDIATELY
TERMINATE THESE PROCEEDINGS

02:08.729 --> 02:10.231
IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANTS

02:10.264 --> 02:12.766
AND TO MAKE THESE
"BASELESS CHARGES,"

02:12.800 --> 02:14.302
AS HE PUTS IT,
JUST GO AWAY.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.704
I NOTICE DEFENDANTS
AREN'T EVEN WAITING

02:16.737 --> 02:19.207
FOR YOUR HONOR'S RULING
TO GO AWAY.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.183
YOUR HONOR,
I AM SADDENED TO ANNOUNCE

02:29.217 --> 02:30.384
THAT JUST MOMENTS AGO,

02:30.418 --> 02:32.186
A DEPUTY SHERIFF
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.222
I HOPE YOUR HONOR
IS NOT OFFENDED,

02:34.255 --> 02:37.358
UNDERSTANDING THAT
POLICE OFFICERS ARE OFTENTIMES

02:37.391 --> 02:40.428
REQUIRED TO PUT PUBLIC SAFETY
AHEAD OF PERSONAL INTEREST.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.334
ANYTHING FURTHER,
MR. GOLDMAN?

02:46.367 --> 02:49.203
[ SIREN WAILS,
HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ]

02:56.944 --> 02:58.979
Gabriel: HEY, CHIEF.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.648
SO, TWO PLAINCLOTHES
DEPUTY SHERIFFS

03:00.681 --> 03:02.283
WERE DRIVING SOUTH
ON CRENSHAW

03:02.316 --> 03:03.717
WHEN ONE OF THEM RECOGNIZED
A STOLEN MASERATI

03:03.751 --> 03:04.852
BY ITS LICENSE PLATES.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.420
Brenda:
ARE THESE VANITY PLATES?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.855
IT DOESN'T LOOK IT TO ME.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.723
ANYWAY, THEY WERE FOLLOWING
THE STOLEN VEHICLE

03:09.757 --> 03:11.892
WHEN THE THIEVES MUST HAVE
REALIZED THEY HAD BEEN MADE.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.694
"THIEVES" --
THAT'S PLURAL?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.663
TWO GUYS
IN THE FRONT SEATS, CHIEF.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.631
MASERATI TURNED
IN TO THIS DEAD-END,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.900
DID A 180,

03:19.933 --> 03:23.904
FRONT-SEAT PASSENGER
CAME OUT FIRING -- BAM-BAM!

03:23.937 --> 03:25.639
BAM-BAM! BAM! --

03:25.673 --> 03:29.443
.45 AUTO --
AT THE SHERIFF'S VEHICLE,

03:29.477 --> 03:30.944
KILLING DEPUTY BRIAN RUSH,

03:30.978 --> 03:32.246
WHO WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.747
SHOOTER TOOK OFF
ON FOOT.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.984
THE VICTIM'S PARTNER
WASN'T HIT.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.653
HE WAS ABLE TO WRESTLE THE CUFFS
ON THE OTHER SUSPECT.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.854
SHOOTER'S ALREADY ESCAPED,

03:40.888 --> 03:43.457
CARJACKED A WOMAN
TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.293
KNOCKED HER DOWN
PRETTY HARD, TOO.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.328
SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL,
BUT SHE'LL LIVE.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.430
I PUT A WANT OUT ON HER CAR.
IT'S A HONDA.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.532
PLEASE MAKE SURE THE DRIVER
OF THE ESCAPED VEHICLE

03:51.565 --> 03:53.000
IS DESIGNATED
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.536
I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
WALKING INTO AN AMBUSH.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.505
IF THE CAR'S
FOUND PARKED SOMEWHERE,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.407
IT'S "STAKE AND NOTIFY."
THANK YOU.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.679
Flynn: HEY, CHIEF.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.017
YOU WANT TO MEET
OUR NEWEST CONTENDER

04:10.050 --> 04:12.653
FOR ASSHOLE OF THE YEAR?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.054
THAT'S THE OTHER CAR THIEF?
HE LOOKS 15.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.723
WE I.D.'d HIM
FROM HIS CELLPHONE --

04:15.756 --> 04:16.924
KYLE HAYES, AGE 22.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.293
GOT ONE PRIOR
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.829
WELL, KYLE JUST MADE
AN AGGRESSIVE LEAP FORWARD

04:21.862 --> 04:23.063
IN HIS CRIMINAL CAREER.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.766
CHIEF JOHNSON,
DEPUTY MIKE BURTON.

04:25.799 --> 04:29.737
DEPUTY, I'M -- I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARTNER.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.838
DO YOU NEED A MINUTE?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.540
NO, LET'S GO.
HOW CAN I HELP?

04:32.573 --> 04:35.476
Y'ALL WERE A LONG WAY FROM
WEST HOLLYWOOD THIS MORNING.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.678
BRIAN AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING
FOR A MISSING WITNESS

04:37.711 --> 04:39.347
IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL,

04:39.380 --> 04:40.981
AND WE WERE HEADED OUT TO
BOYLE HEIGHTS FOLLOWING A TIP

04:41.014 --> 04:43.451
WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THE
LICENSE PLATES OF A MASERATI

04:43.484 --> 04:45.553
RIGHT AHEAD OF US AS BELONGING
TO A STOLEN CAR.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.388
RECOGNIZED
THE PLATES HOW?

04:47.421 --> 04:50.591
WAS THERE A SPECIAL ALERT OUT
ON THE MASERATI?
NO, NO.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.526
I -- THE, UH --

04:52.560 --> 04:55.329
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
HAS A SPECIAL-PROBLEMS UNIT,

04:55.363 --> 04:57.331
PART OF A JOINT TASK FORCE
WITH THE FBI

04:57.365 --> 04:58.732
LOOKING FOR A RING
OF CAR THIEVES

04:58.766 --> 05:01.602
TARGETING A BUNCH
OF HIGH-END VEHICLES.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.871
THEY PUT OUT A LIST OF
LICENSE PLATES ONCE A MONTH.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.440
SO YOU FOUND THE CAR,
STARTED FOLLOWING IT.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.576
WHY DIDN'T YOU RADIO
FOR BACKUP?

05:08.609 --> 05:09.843
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.379
WE SAW THE CAR,
CHANGED LANES BEHIND IT,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.347
WE TURNED THE CORNER,
AND WE WERE SHORT STOPPED.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.948
I MEAN, THEY MUST HAVE
FLAGGED US SOMEHOW.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.316
CHIEF.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.788
PARDON ME, DEPUTY.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.526
SHERIFF UNDERSTANDS
IT'S OUR CASE NOW.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.994
Pope: I SAY WE TAKE
THE SUSPECT WE HAVE,

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
GET HIM
INTO AN INTERVIEW ROOM,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.030
AND SEE IF WE CAN CONVINCE HIM
TO GIVE UP THE SHOOTER

05:30.063 --> 05:31.064
BEFORE HE KILLS AGAIN.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.100
UH, LIEUTENANT TAO,

05:33.133 --> 05:35.769
I WANT YOU TO PERSONALLY PULL
ALL PRINTS FROM THAT MASERATI.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.505
SEE IF WE CAN IDENTIFY
THE KILLER.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.640
BUZZ, PLEASE GATHER
ALL SECURITY VIDEO

05:39.673 --> 05:40.841
FROM BUSINESSES BETWEEN HERE

05:40.874 --> 05:42.410
AND WHERE THE CARJACKING
TOOK PLACE.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.045
A PICTURE OF THE SHOOTER
WOULD BE NICE. THANK YOU.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.680
AND, UH, COMMANDER,

05:46.714 --> 05:49.417
PLEASE KEEP DEPUTY BURTON
CLOSE AT HAND.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.084
SHERIFF'S PROTOCOL
IS BURTON GOES BACK

05:51.118 --> 05:52.553
TO HIS HOME DEPARTMENT,

05:52.586 --> 05:53.921
EXCHANGES HIS GUN,
AND GETS HIS REP.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.424
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT WHEN WE FIND THE KILLER,

05:56.457 --> 05:58.626
I MAY NEED BURTON'S HELP
IN IDENTIFYING HIM.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.760
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.662
I'D LIKE YOU
TO SUPERVISE THE SEARCH

06:01.695 --> 06:03.130
FOR THE ESCAPE VEHICLE,
PLEASE.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.798
THANK YOU.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.867
MEANWHILE, I'LL WORK
WITH THE SUSPECT WE DO HAVE.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.877
THANK YOU.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.480
YOU CAN LEAVE US ALONE.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.892
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.927
BUT...

07:06.960 --> 07:08.629
I'VE BEEN AT THIS JOB
A WHILE.

07:08.662 --> 07:12.099
MET A LOT OF YOUNG BOYS
WHO GOT INTO TROUBLE

07:12.132 --> 07:15.869
JUST FROM HANGING AROUND
WITH THE WRONG CROWD.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.905
DOES THAT DESCRIBE YOU,
OR ARE YOU A COP KILLER?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.649
I'VE GOT THE CHIEF'S INTERVIEW
UP RECORDING FOR YOU.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.619
THANKS.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.521
I ASK IF YOU'RE
A COP KILLER BECAUSE,

07:33.554 --> 07:34.888
UNLESS WE FIND
YOUR ACCOMPLICE,

07:34.922 --> 07:36.890
THE D.A. WILL CHARGE YOU
AS ONE.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.492
I NEVER EVEN PULLED MY GUN.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.693
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW,

07:39.727 --> 07:41.194
YOU'RE AS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH

07:41.228 --> 07:42.963
OF DEPUTY SHERIFF RUSH
AS YOUR FRIEND.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.698
NOW, I DON'T WANT
TO CHARGE YOU, KYLE,

07:44.732 --> 07:46.066
BUT I HAVE TO
FOLLOW THE LAW.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.569
IF YOU FOLLOW IT
WITH ME,

07:48.602 --> 07:50.070
I CAN HELP YOU
OUT OF THIS MESS.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.974
GIVE ME THE NAME OF THE MAN
WHO WAS IN THAT CAR WITH YOU,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.576
AND I CAN SAVE YOU.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.994
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, KYLE.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.096
IF I FIND THE MAN WHO SHOT
AND KILLED A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY

08:16.129 --> 08:17.731
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,

08:17.765 --> 08:19.567
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE ON DEATH ROW.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.304
YOU'VE MADE A LOT
OF BAD CHOICES TODAY.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.073
DON'T LET THIS BE
ONE OF THEM.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.144
YES?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.646
YES?!

08:37.885 --> 08:40.988
Chief,
I've i.d.'d some prints.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.726
BE BACK IN A MINUTE,
KYLE.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.928
YOU BETTER HOPE
I STILL NEED YOUR HELP.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.067
ALTOGETHER, I PULLED 12 PRINTS
OFF THE MASERATI.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.570
THREE BELONGED TO THE OWNER,
TWO BELONGED TO HAYES,

08:56.604 --> 08:58.706
LEAVING SEVEN PRINTS
THAT MATCH UP

08:58.739 --> 09:00.173
WITH THREE OTHER
KNOWN CRIMINALS.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.975
THREE OTHER
KNOWN CRIMINALS?
MM-HMM.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.611
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.345
HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE
TO STEAL A CAR THESE DAYS?

09:05.378 --> 09:07.014
DEPUTY BURTON SAID THAT

09:07.047 --> 09:09.750
THERE WERE JUST TWO PEOPLE
IN THAT MASERATI.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.886
I HAVE SOME MUG SHOTS.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.723
NOW, ONE OF THEM MIGHT MATCH UP
TO A PICTURE

09:15.756 --> 09:18.291
I FOUND ON KYLE'S CELLPHONE --
DAVID COBB.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.960
NOW, HIS PRINTS
WERE IN THE CAR.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.595
THIS PICTURE'S
LOW RESOLUTION,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.731
BUT I SUPPOSE I CAN BUMP UP
THE CONTRAST RATIO.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.799
BUT THAT GETS
A BIT TRICKY BECAUSE --

09:25.833 --> 09:28.068
LIEUTENANT, PLEASE,
JUST GIVE ME THE MUG SHOTS.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.837
I NEED TO SHOW THEM
TO THE SUSPECT.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.157
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.391
YEAH, THANK YOU.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.193
IF KYLE SEES HOW FAR ALONG
WE ARE,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.628
MAYBE HE'LL GET US THE REST
OF THE WAY HOME.
MM.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.396
THANK YOU.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.986
He's got a gun!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.153
Call S.W.A.T.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.889
Tao!

10:37.170 --> 10:38.939
Monitor.
Monitor.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.746
KYLE, THERE ARE CAMERAS
IN THERE!

10:45.779 --> 10:46.847
I'M WATCHING YOU!

10:46.880 --> 10:50.183
I'M WATCHING YOU RIGHT NOW!

10:50.217 --> 10:53.086
I CAN SEE YOU!

11:00.460 --> 11:02.830
KYLE, I WANT YOU TO PUT THAT GUN
ON THE TABLE

11:02.863 --> 11:05.232
AND STEP TO THE FAR CORNER
OF THE ROOM!

11:11.839 --> 11:14.141
KYLE, PUT THE GUN ON THE TABLE,

11:14.174 --> 11:17.745
AND STEP TO THE FAR CORNER
OF THE ROOM! NOW!

11:17.778 --> 11:20.413
OH, MAN.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.315
WHAT A TOTALLY
SCREWED-UP DAY.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.991
THIS BULLET WAS MEANT FOR YOU.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.993
KYLE?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.030
KYLE?

11:39.466 --> 11:40.934
KYLE!

11:44.104 --> 11:45.505
Tao: CHIEF,
THIS WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.507
IF BURTON DIDN'T FIND THE GUN
WHEN HE CUFFED HAYES,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.509
THEN OUR PATROL OFFICERS
SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT

11:49.542 --> 11:51.812
WHEN THEY TOOK CUSTODY OR WHEN
THEY BROUGHT HIM IN HERE.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.180
NO.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.915
IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE SURE

11:54.948 --> 11:56.316
THAT KYLE
WAS PROPERLY SEARCHED

11:56.349 --> 11:58.118
BEFORE HE ENTERED
THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.821
AND IT'S AN...

12:00.854 --> 12:03.056
IN-CUSTODY DEATH,

12:03.090 --> 12:04.457
SO F.I.D. HAS EVERY RIGHT
TO BE HERE.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.926
CHIEF JOHNSON.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.460
PROVENZA: Provenza.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.463
Listen, Patrol found the Honda.
It's at 8th and Alameda.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.132
NOW, WE CAN SIT ON IT,

12:12.165 --> 12:15.102
BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT THE KILLER
DUMPED IT AND --

12:15.135 --> 12:16.503
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.171
LIEUTENANT TAO HAS PRINTS
FROM MULTIPLE SUSPECTS

12:18.205 --> 12:21.241
TO CHECK AGAINST WHATEVER'S
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.110
Please hold off on that search
until he gets there.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.212
8th AND ALAMEDA.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.880
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY?
IS HE TALKING?

12:26.914 --> 12:29.149
YOU COULD SAY HE INVOKED
HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.418
UH...LIEUTENANT TAO WILL EXPLAIN
WHEN HE GETS THERE.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.056
CHIEF, I CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL F.I.D. INTERVIEWS ME.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.224
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.491
THIS IS A TIME-SENSITIVE
SITUATION.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.160
THEY'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.962
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
IS AT THIS ADDRESS

12:41.995 --> 12:43.897
WITH THE HONDA THE KILLER USED
TO ESCAPE.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.466
TAKE THE PRINTS THAT YOU PULLED
OFF THE MASERATI THIS MORNING,

12:46.499 --> 12:48.869
CHECK THEM AGAINST
WHATEVER'S INSIDE THAT VEHICLE,

12:48.902 --> 12:50.804
AND GET ME A POSITIVE I.D.
ON THE SHOOTER.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.940
THAT'S AN ORDER,
LIEUTENANT.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.177
OKAY, BUZZ.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.380
THANK YOU...

13:00.413 --> 13:02.315
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.385
NOW, LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN ACT.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.103
Pope:
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.271
UH...HOW ARE YOU DOING?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.906
I'VE HAD EASIER
MORNINGS.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.074
Taylor: CHEER UP.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.341
A COP KILLER
JUST SHOT HIMSELF,

13:28.375 --> 13:30.010
SO ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.912
ABOUT THIS SUICIDE --

13:31.945 --> 13:33.346
I TRIED TO TALK HER
OUT OF IT,

13:33.380 --> 13:34.848
BUT CAPTAIN RAYDOR INSISTS
ON SPEAKING WITH YOU

13:34.882 --> 13:36.616
BEFORE YOU RESUME
THE INVESTIGATION.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.852
I EXPECTED
TO BE QUESTIONED.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.290
AT LEAST IT WAS JUST
BUZZ AND ME HERE.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.058
RIGHT, YES.
EXCELLENT WORK, BUZZ.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.060
THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.097
Brenda: KYLE?
Kyle: THIS BULLET
WAS MEANT FOR YOU.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.232
KYLE?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.533
KYLE?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.346
THANK YOU.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.124
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.294
I-I THINK SO, YES.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.364
FROM WHAT I JUST SAW,
YOU NEARLY DIED.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.204
OKAY.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.974
WHO ELSE IN YOUR DIVISION
WAS WITH YOU?

14:34.007 --> 14:37.310
AS YOU COULD SEE FROM
THE RECORDING, I WAS ALONE.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.415
SOMEONE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR
TO YOUR INTERVIEW ROOM

14:42.449 --> 14:43.416
AND PULLED YOU OUT.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.052
Buzz:
I DID THAT, CAPTAIN.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.387
CHIEF JOHNSON DIDN'T HAVE
HER EARWIG WITH HER,

14:47.420 --> 14:50.357
AND I HAD BREAKING INFORMATION
FROM LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.395
WOULD YOU MIND
LEAVING US ALONE, PLEASE?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.442
CHIEF, YOU KNOW
IT'S ALWAYS RISKY

15:09.476 --> 15:12.512
TO LEAVE A SUSPECT ALONE
IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.415
I KNOW PROCEDURE
WASN'T PROPERLY FOLLOWED,

15:15.448 --> 15:18.051
AND IT'S A BAD DAY
TO HAVE IT HAPPEN.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.187
I WISH I'D DONE BETTER,
BUT...

15:20.220 --> 15:23.190
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S A LOT WORSE THAN ME.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.193
AND I'M JUST ASKING FOR THIS DAY
TO SEE IF I CAN FIND HIM.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.430
JUST THIS DAY --
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.664
I CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THAT.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.566
I'VE GOT 72 HOURS
TO FILE THIS REPORT,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.235
SO I WILL JUST RESUME
THIS PART

15:35.268 --> 15:36.736
OF THE INVESTIGATION
AFTER THAT.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.171
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

15:38.205 --> 15:40.207
I WILL INTERVIEW
EVERY SINGLE OFFICER

15:40.240 --> 15:42.509
WHO HAD CHARGE
OF THAT SUSPECT

15:42.542 --> 15:45.378
BETWEEN THE CRIME SCENE
AND YOUR INTERVIEW ROOM.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.481
WHERE CAN I FIND
THE DEPUTY SHERIFF

15:48.515 --> 15:50.283
WHO TOOK MR. HAYES
INTO CUSTODY?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.485
UH, COMMANDER TAYLOR
IS KEEPING TRACK OF HIM.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.653
OKAY.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.123
TH-THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.524
THANKS.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.160
OKAY.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.401
Provenza: THEY'LL MAKE A NEW
RULE FOR SEARCHING SUSPECTS.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.570
I PROMISE YOU --
THEY'LL MAKE A NEW RULE.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.106
IF THERE ARE PEOPLE GETTING
INTO THE BUILDING WITH GUNS,

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
THEN MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE
A NEW RULE.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.343
Tao:
RADIAL ARCH WITH A DELTA.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.278
NINE RIDGES.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.684
HEH.
IT'S DAVID COBB!

16:24.717 --> 16:27.520
I HAVE PICTURES OF HIM
RIGHT HERE.

16:27.554 --> 16:31.791
HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS
IS 544 SOUTH BERENDO.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.726
I'LL CALL FOR THE WARRANT.
WE DON'T NEED
A WARRANT, MIKE.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.129
THIS IS FRESH PURSUIT.
SANCHEZ, COME WITH ME.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.397
CALL S.I.S.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.032
I WANT UNDERCOVER UNITS

16:39.066 --> 16:40.400
IN A THREE-BLOCK RADIUS
AROUND COBB'S HOUSE.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.369
YOU GUYS TAKE THESE PHOTOS
OF OUR SUSPECT.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.603
WALK AROUND HERE.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.405
SEE IF SOMEBODY
CAN IDENTIFY HIM.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.207
IF HE'S STILL
IN THE VICINITY,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.509
OR IF HE COMES BACK AGAIN --
WELL, COME ON.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.543
BE CAREFUL.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.283
LET'S SPLIT UP.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.521
NO.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.324
NONE OF MY PEOPLE
HAVE SEEN HIM, EITHER.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.227
OKAY, AND YOU KNOW THAT
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING THEM?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.495
WELL, HE'S THE SAME GUY
THE OTHER COP

17:08.528 --> 17:10.330
WAS LOOKING FOR
AN HOUR AGO.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.698
SUPPOSED TO HAVE CARJACKED
AN OLD LADY'S HONDA
SOMEWHERE, YEAH?

17:11.731 --> 17:12.832
WAIT, WAIT.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.367
THIS OTHER COP,

17:14.401 --> 17:15.568
DID HE GIVE YOU HIS CARD
OR YOU GET HIS NAME?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.304
NO.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.838
BUT NOW THAT YOU ASK,
HE WASN'T A COP.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.407
HE WAS
A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.142
THANK YOU.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.078
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL, UH, WE'LL SORT IT OUT.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.846
THANK YOU.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.748
DEPUTY BURTON IS MISSING?

17:28.781 --> 17:30.683
CHIEF, I DID
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.385
I TOLD
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

17:32.419 --> 17:34.087
TO HAVE BURTON CALL US

17:34.121 --> 17:35.688
WHEN HE FINISHED GIVING
HIS STATEMENT, AND NOW --

17:35.722 --> 17:38.125
BUT NOW WE CAN'T FIND HIM,
CAN WE?

17:38.158 --> 17:39.426
THEY --
NO, YOU!

17:39.459 --> 17:40.660
YOU, COMMANDER --

17:40.693 --> 17:42.529
I ASKED YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.197
AND NOW WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
BURTON IS OR WHAT HE'S DOING.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.268
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

17:48.301 --> 17:50.703
IS PUTTING ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
ON THE STREET TO FIND HIM.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.505
THIS WILL WORK OUT.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.241
I PROMISE.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.658
WE'VE CLEARED THE HOUSES NEXT TO
THE COBB RESIDENCE, LIEUTENANT,

18:11.691 --> 18:12.659
AND ACROSS THE STREET.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.827
OKAY.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.296
EVERYONE READY?

18:18.298 --> 18:19.632
TAKE THE BACK.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.135
YOU STAY WITH DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
YOU STAY WITH ME.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.170
ALL RIGHT.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.772
Man: BE CAREFUL.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.475
HEADS UP, NOW.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.357
Provenza: SET.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.725
JULIO.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.127
GO!

18:49.629 --> 18:50.897
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.432
DON'T MOVE!

18:52.465 --> 18:53.933
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.168
GET YOUR HANDS
ABOVE YOUR HEAD!

18:55.202 --> 18:57.404
UP!
ABOVE YOUR HEAD!

18:57.437 --> 18:58.905
CLEAR.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.855
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.924
IT BETTER NOT BE.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.228
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS,
JULIO.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.929
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.631
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU

19:24.664 --> 19:25.865
IN A COURT OF LAW.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.234
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.568
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE,

19:28.601 --> 19:30.370
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED FOR YOU
BY THE STATE.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.580
Tao: THE GUN USED TO KILL
DEPUTY RUSH

19:40.613 --> 19:41.714
WAS THE SAME ONE USED
ON DAVID COBB.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.882
AND DEPUTY BURTON'S
WEAPON?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.417
NOT FIRED.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.586
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.788
HE COULD HAVE SHOT COBB
WITH COBB'S OWN GUN.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.265
SO, YOU DIDN'T GIVE
THE SUSPECT THE GUN

19:58.298 --> 19:59.599
HE SHOT HIMSELF WITH,
DID YOU?

19:59.632 --> 20:01.968
GAVIN, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.836
MM, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
ISN'T FUNNY?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.672
YOU HAVING ANOTHER
IN-CUSTODY DEATH

20:05.705 --> 20:07.474
WITHOUT INFORMING
YOUR ATTORNEY.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.542
TURELL BAYLOR WAS NOT
AN IN-CUSTODY DEATH.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.344
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT GOLDMAN IS SAYING.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.480
AND 30 MINUTES AGO,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.915
HE DEMANDED A CONTINUANCE BASED
ON RELEVANT, NEW INFORMATION,

20:15.948 --> 20:17.450
WHICH HE POSSESSED
AND I DID NOT.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.686
GOLDMAN KNOWS
ABOUT THIS ALREADY

20:19.719 --> 20:21.988
FROM THE LEAK
IN THE DIVISION,

20:22.021 --> 20:25.392
WHICH YOU REFUSE
TO BELIEVE EXISTS.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.859
OH, MY GOD.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.396
I WAS ON THE VERGE OF HAVING
THIS ENTIRE CASE THROWN OUT.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.464
NOW IT'S UP IN THE AIR.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.899
WHERE'S CAPTAIN RAYDOR?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.334
SHE'S BACK IN HER OFFICE.
WHY?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.968
I HAVE TO TALK TO HER

20:36.002 --> 20:40.039
BEFORE ANOTHER LAWSUIT IS FILED
AGAINST YOU BY THE FAMILY

20:40.072 --> 20:42.475
OF YOUR NEWEST
DEAD SUSPECT.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.843
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU COULD AFFORD IT,

20:43.876 --> 20:45.412
I COULD DROP EVERYONE ELSE
IN MY PRACTICE

20:45.445 --> 20:46.679
AND DEFEND YOU
FOR A LIVING.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.381
YOU KNOW THAT MAN
WAS GOING TO KILL ME?

20:48.415 --> 20:52.452
MAYBE HE THOUGHT HE'D END UP
REPRESENTING YOU IN COURT.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.491
UGH.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.431
IT'S...NATURAL CAUSES.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.333
YOU'RE USING UP
ALL YOUR NINE LIVES, BABY.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.367
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.538
DEPUTY BURTON SAID
THAT THE STOLEN MASERATI

21:11.571 --> 21:15.074
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
A SPECIAL-PROBLEMS UNIT --

21:15.107 --> 21:17.344
SOME KIND OF
JOINT TASK FORCE

21:17.377 --> 21:19.979
BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
AND THE FBI.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.548
YEAH, IT'S A SPECIAL PROBLEM,
ALL RIGHT.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.715
COME HERE.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.089
TAKE A LOOK.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.791
WE GOT A FLAG ON YOUR STOLEN
MASERATI THIS MORNING.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.460
OH...

21:33.493 --> 21:34.827
THERE'S A RING
OF HIGH-TECH CAR THIEVES.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.829
IS THIS GANG RELATED?
NO, NO.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.097
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL
ORGANIZATION,

21:38.130 --> 21:41.000
RUN BY A COMPETENT
AND DISCIPLINED ADULT.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.869
OKAY.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.472
35 VEHICLES STOLEN

21:45.505 --> 21:46.939
DURING THE FIRST WEEK
OF EVERY MONTH.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.476
PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE SHIPPING SCHEDULE.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.412
HERE'S THE THEORY --
TWO THIEVES STEAL A CAR.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.014
THEY USE A COMPUTER TO GENERATE
A COUNTERFEIT ELECTRONIC KEY.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.683
THEY DRIVE THE CAR
TO A SPOT

21:56.716 --> 21:59.452
WHERE THEY CAN DISCONNECT
THE VEHICLE-RECOVERY SYSTEM

21:59.486 --> 22:00.820
AND WATCH IT FOR A WHILE.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.389
AND WHEN THEY'RE SURE
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWED,

22:02.422 --> 22:05.492
TWO MIDDLEMEN COME IN
WITH FAKE CUSTOMS DOCUMENTS.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.126
THEY DRIVE THE STOLEN CAR

22:07.159 --> 22:10.497
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PORT
TO BE SENT OVERSEAS.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.932
SO TWO THIEVES STEAL A CAR,
AND TWO OTHER GUYS SHIP IT OFF.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.034
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE WERE
FOUR SETS OF PRINTS

22:15.067 --> 22:16.569
IN THE MASERATI
THIS MORNING.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.739
AND, UH, DEPUTY BURTON
AND, UH, RUSH --

22:19.772 --> 22:22.875
WERE EITHER OF THEM PART
OF THIS SPECIAL

22:22.909 --> 22:25.845
NO, BUT THEY BOTH APPLIED
TO JOIN SEVERAL TIMES

22:25.878 --> 22:28.948
AND SEVERAL TIMES WERE TOLD
THEY LACKED SENIORITY.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.484
NO, WHY WERE THEY BOTH
SO DETERMINED

22:31.518 --> 22:33.720
TO BE PART OF
THIS INVESTIGATION?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.455
BECAUSE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

22:35.488 --> 22:37.724
AND THE FBI
WEREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.626
THEY KEPT ARRESTING GUYS
IN THE ACT OF STEALING THE CARS.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.960
SO, WHAT,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

22:40.993 --> 22:42.662
WITH INTERRUPTING
PROPERTY THEFT?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.764
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE GUY
WHO'S IN CHARGE, YES, I DO.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.833
YOU PICK UP A COUPLE LOW-LEVEL
GUYS GRABBING A LEXUS --

22:46.866 --> 22:48.468
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

22:48.501 --> 22:49.802
TWO LITTLE FISH WHO WON'T SAY
WHO THEY'RE WORKING FOR,

22:49.836 --> 22:50.970
WHO LAWYER UP,
SPEND A LITTLE TIME IN COUNTY

22:51.003 --> 22:52.805
WHILE WE LEARN NOTHING.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.174
BRIAN AND I
HAD ANOTHER IDEA.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.710
I CAN'T THINK
WHY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

22:57.744 --> 22:59.846
DIDN'T HAND OVER THE ENTIRE
INVESTIGATION TO YOU,

22:59.879 --> 23:01.648
CONSIDERING HOW BRILLIANTLY
YOU DO YOUR JOB.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.450
YEAH, LIKE THE YOUNG MAN
YOU SEARCHED THIS MORNING

23:03.483 --> 23:05.084
WHEN YOU ARRESTED HIM --
THAT WAS REMARKABLE.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.519
IT WAS JUST GREAT.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.554
OKAY, LOOK --
I'M SORRY I MISSED THE GUN.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.689
MY ADRENALINE WAS PUMPING.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.058
MY PARTNER WAS DEAD.
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

23:12.091 --> 23:13.626
AND SOME WAY TO CONTAIN
THE DAMAGE.
THAT DEPUTY
JUST TOOK RESPONSIBILITY

23:13.660 --> 23:15.127
FOR NOT SEARCHING A SUSPECT
THIS MORNING.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.829
SHOULD WE RUN OFF A COPY
OF THIS INTERVIEW,

23:16.863 --> 23:18.130
GIVE IT TO GAVIN
TO SHOW THE JUDGE?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.932
YEAH. YEAH,
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.768
YOU THOUGHT CHASING DOWN
YOUR PARTNER'S KILLER

23:21.801 --> 23:22.935
WITH INFORMATION THAT
YOU DID NOT SHARE WITH US --

23:22.969 --> 23:24.170
THAT WAS
"CONTAINING THE DAMAGE"?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.938
HEAR ME OUT,
AND THEN TELL ME I WAS WRONG!

23:25.972 --> 23:27.740
Brenda: WE'LL LISTEN,

23:27.774 --> 23:29.175
BUT BEAR IN MIND,

23:29.208 --> 23:31.578
MY CONCERN HERE IS MURDER,
NOT STOLEN CARS.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.613
LOOK...

23:33.646 --> 23:36.415
BRIAN AND I,
WE WERE JUST...

23:38.217 --> 23:40.720
...HUNTING FOR A CHANCE
TO MAKE OUR MARK.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.923
AND WE KEPT LOOKING AT THE
SPECIAL-PROBLEMS-UNIT REPORTS

23:43.956 --> 23:45.992
AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM
TO BE GETTING ANY CLOSER

23:46.025 --> 23:47.927
TO CATCHING THE BIG FISH --
THE GUY IN CHARGE.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.829
SO THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
WHENEVER WE COULD MAKE THE TIME,

23:49.862 --> 23:50.997
WE STAKED OUT
A PARKING STRUCTURE

23:51.030 --> 23:52.932
ON SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.734
AND LAST WEEK,
WE GOT LUCKY.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.236
WATCHED A COUPLE GUYS
ON LAPTOPS CREATE A KEY

23:57.269 --> 24:00.006
FOR A BRAND-NEW MASERATI
AND DRIVE OFF IN IT.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.608
WE MANAGED TO STAY
WITH THEM

24:01.641 --> 24:02.875
ALL THE WAY TO A PARKING LOT
AT 8th AND ALAMEDA,

24:02.909 --> 24:04.243
AND WE SAT ON THAT CAR
TILL THIS MORNING.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.846
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL
FOR BACKUP?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.581
'CAUSE WE COULDN'T
CONTROL THE BUREAUCRATIC
RESPONSE, YOU KNOW?

24:08.615 --> 24:09.916
THE SPECIAL-PROBLEMS UNIT
MASSED,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.551
THEY MIGHT GET
A FEW VEHICLES BACK,

24:11.584 --> 24:13.019
BUT THE PARKING LOT
WOULD BE BURNT.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.254
NO TO MENTION,
YOU'D HAVE TO SHARE CREDIT

24:15.287 --> 24:16.556
FOR YOUR BIG IDEA.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.629
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYONE
SURVEILLING THE PARKING LOT?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.030
NO.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.798
DID ANYONE EVER SEE YOU?
NO.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.635
BUT WE DID SPOT A LOT OF
OTHER CARS BEING DROPPED OFF.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.603
THAT LOT IS FILLED
WITH STOLEN VEHICLES.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.674
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.510
SO, TWO GUYS CAME TO PICK UP THE
STOLEN MASERATI THIS MORNING.

24:37.544 --> 24:38.878
AND THEY WEREN'T
THE LITTLE FISH

24:38.911 --> 24:40.747
WHO HAD STOLEN THE CAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE, EITHER.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.850
THESE WERE MIDDLEMEN,
AT LEAST --

24:43.883 --> 24:47.620
COMING TO DRIVE THE MASERATI OFF
TO BE SHIPPED SOMEWHERE.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.523
THEY PARKED THE VEHICLE
THEY CAME IN UP THE STREET,

24:50.557 --> 24:51.791
WALKED TO THE MASERATI,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.160
AND DROVE OFF IN IT,
TOWARD THE PORT.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.796
AND WE FOLLOWED
AT A GOOD DISTANCE

24:56.829 --> 24:58.798
FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES,
THINKING OUR PLAN HAD WORKED,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.299
AND WE HAD A COUPLE
OF THE HIGHER UPS

25:00.332 --> 25:02.101
AND WERE JUST MINUTES AWAY
FROM FINDING OUT

25:02.134 --> 25:03.803
WHERE THESE CARS
WERE BEING LOADED UP.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.104
THEN...

25:05.137 --> 25:06.606
FOR SOME REASON,

25:06.639 --> 25:08.240
THE GUYS IN THE MASERATI
MADE A SHARP TURN,

25:08.274 --> 25:10.843
SOME KIND OF COUNTER-
SURVEILLANCE MOVE, I GUESS.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.947
WE WENT AFTER THEM,
AND --

25:14.981 --> 25:16.716
YOUR PLAN --

25:16.749 --> 25:19.285
IT WORKED SO WELL THAT
YOUR PARTNER WAS SHOT TO DEATH.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.821
OKAY, SO, TELL US --

25:21.854 --> 25:23.623
HOW DID YOU END UP
AT THE KILLER'S HOUSE?

25:23.656 --> 25:26.258
WAIT A MINUTE.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.061
WHEN THOSE GUYS CAME TO PICK UP
THE MASERATI THIS MORNING,

25:29.095 --> 25:30.897
THEY LEFT
THEIR OWN VEHICLE BEHIND.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.799
SO, WHEN I WAS WITH YOU
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.334
YOU KN THAT THE KILLER

25:35.367 --> 25:37.670
WOULD BE TRYING TO GET BACK
TO HIS CAR, IS THAT RIGHT?

25:37.704 --> 25:38.971
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YEAH,

25:39.005 --> 25:40.673
BUT COBB'S CAR WAS GONE
WHEN I GOT THERE,

25:40.707 --> 25:42.742
SO I RAN HIS PLATES,
WHICH WE HAD WRITTEN DOWN.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.310
AND I HAD HIS DMV PHOTO
FAXED TO ME.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.278
CHECKED WITH
AREA BUSINESSES

25:46.312 --> 25:48.114
TO SEE IF HE WAS HIDING
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SOMEWHERE.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.816
THEN I DROVE TO HIS HOUSE,

25:49.849 --> 25:51.618
WENT IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR,
AND COBB WAS ALREADY DEAD.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.352
I WAS --

25:53.385 --> 25:55.287
I WAS ABOUT TO CLEAR THE HOUSE
AND CALL MY OFFICE

25:55.321 --> 25:57.056
WHEN YOUR GUYS CAME IN
THROUGH THE FRONT --

25:57.089 --> 25:59.291
SO, AFTER YOUR PARTNER --

25:59.325 --> 26:01.628
YOUR PARTNER --
WAS SHOT DEAD,

26:01.661 --> 26:02.929
YOU KEPT ON PLAYING SUPERCOP,
CORRECT?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.931
I WAS FOLLOWING THE LEAD!

26:04.964 --> 26:08.200
RIGHT OVER THE LINE THAT WE ARE
NEVER, EVER SUPPOSED TO CROSS.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.369
YOU KNOW, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
WORKS PRETTY WELL

26:10.402 --> 26:13.205
UNTIL SOMEONE STARTS THINKING
THAT THEY'RE SMARTER

26:13.239 --> 26:14.774
THAN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE,
THE FBI,

26:14.807 --> 26:16.709
AND THE ENTIRE L.A.P.D.
COMBINED!

26:16.743 --> 26:18.077
DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

26:18.110 --> 26:19.846
WHEN YOU THROW AWAY
THE RULE BOOK, DEPUTY?

26:19.879 --> 26:21.848
PEOPLE DIE!
I'M SORRY!

26:23.215 --> 26:25.885
DO YOU THINK SHE'S CONSCIOUS
OF WHAT SHE'S SAYING?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.220
SOMEBODY MAY WANT TO PLAY BACK
THIS PART OF THE INTERVIEW

26:28.254 --> 26:30.890
FOR HER
WHEN SHE GETS HOME TONIGHT.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.259
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.695
BUT YOU HAVE
THE PARKING LOT.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.296
AND WE KNOW THAT THE MIDDLEMEN
ARE MOVING THE VEHICLES

26:37.329 --> 26:38.865
TO THE PORT TODAY.

26:38.898 --> 26:42.068
AND THEY MAY HAVE PAUSED
TO SEE WHAT WE WOULD DO,

26:42.101 --> 26:44.971
BUT IF THEY HAVEN'T ABANDONED
THE PLACE --

26:45.004 --> 26:48.140
KILLING COBB,
THAT WAS JUST THE BIG FISH

26:48.174 --> 26:49.876
TRYING TO CONTAIN
HIS OWN SITUATION.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.844
HE HAS A SCHEDULE TO KEEP
AND LOTS OF OTHER CARS TO MOVE.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.314
WE MADE MISTAKES...

26:59.986 --> 27:01.988
...BUT WE DID NOT
BURN THE LOT.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.658
OKAY.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.096
SO, IF THE PARKING LOT
IS GOOD,

27:10.129 --> 27:13.032
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT?

27:31.217 --> 27:32.752
IF THIS ENDS UP
TAKING A WHILE,

27:32.785 --> 27:34.320
YOU WILL WANT TO HEAD OVER
TO THE COURTROOM

27:34.353 --> 27:36.022
AND HEAR THE JUDGE RULE
ON YOUR MOTION.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.089
Gabriel:
OH, SHE'LL GO.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.991
I PROMISE YOU.
THANK YOU.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.727
FINE, BUT REMEMBER,

27:40.760 --> 27:42.128
WE'RE NOT JUST ROUNDING UP
A BUNCH OF CAR THIEVES.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.395
THESE ARE MURDERERS, TOO.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.964
AND SOMEONE IS WATCHING
THIS PLACE.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.866
JUST BECAUSE BURTON
NEVER FIGURED OUT WHO,

27:46.899 --> 27:48.434
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY AREN'T HERE.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.469
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN
CATCHING A BUNCH OF LITTLE FISH

27:50.502 --> 27:52.271
AND LETTING THE SHARKS
SWIM AWAY.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.040
NOW, WHERE HAVE I
HEARD THAT BEFORE?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.207
JUST BE CAREFUL.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.344
GENTLEMEN.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.094
TAO.
HMM.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.963
11 O'CLOCK.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.965
BOOTS?

28:18.998 --> 28:21.100
YEAH.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.302
HERE -- Psst!
WOW.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.072
HEY, HEY.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.743
UH...

28:30.777 --> 28:32.344
WHAT'S THIS?

28:34.981 --> 28:35.982
HERE WE GO.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.490
CHIEF,
WE HAVE AN ASTON MARTIN,

28:44.523 --> 28:46.092
LICENSE PLATE

28:46.125 --> 28:48.127
3-Y-T-K-1-1-8.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.065
OKAY, LET'S SEE HERE.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.834
WE GOT A WINNER.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.836
STOLEN FIVE DAYS AGO
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

28:56.869 --> 28:57.770
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.171
COPY THAT.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.458
FELLAS, WE'RE GONNA LET THEM
LEAD FROM BEHIND

29:19.491 --> 29:20.860
TILL WE GET
ON THE FREEWAY.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.839
REMEMBER, DO NOT TAKE

29:32.872 --> 29:35.174
ANY UNNECESSARY RISKS
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.910
CONSIDER THEM ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.352
Tao: FELLAS, WE'RE GONNA DO
A LITTLE TRADE.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.087
LET THEM PASS.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.304
Buzz:
AND HERE WE ARE.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.438
COMING UP TO THE PORT.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.888
KEEP YOUR WEAPONS HANDY.
HERE WE GO.

30:21.921 --> 30:22.989
COPY THAT.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.468
Flynn:
HERE WE GO, CHIEF.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.907
DON'T MOVE! PUT YOUR HANDS UP!
TURN AROUND!

31:18.377 --> 31:20.913
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOU.
FACE THE CAR!

31:20.947 --> 31:24.150
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
FACE THE DOOR!

31:28.287 --> 31:30.957
Call, call, call, call.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.328
HELLO?

31:36.362 --> 31:38.564
HEY.
WE'RE ALL SAFE HERE.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.932
OH...

31:39.966 --> 31:41.367
...WITH TWO FRESH SUSPECTS.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.170
PLUS, THE LOADING SITE
AND CUSTOMS DOCUMENTS.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.637
WAIT. HOLD ON.
HERE'S FLYNN ON SPEAKER.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.175
OKAY, CHIEF, THE STOLEN CARS
ARE HEADED FOR ARGENTINA,

31:49.208 --> 31:51.143
BEING SHIPPED
INSIDE CONTAINERS

31:51.177 --> 31:53.212
THAT ARRIVED HERE
FILLED WITH BEEF.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.613
AND THAT MEANS
REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,

31:54.646 --> 31:56.548
THE PERFECT WAY TO GET CARS
WITH BUILT-IN COMPUTERS

31:56.582 --> 31:57.984
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.252
DID YOU SAY ARGENTINA?

32:00.286 --> 32:02.989
Yeah, yeah. Look, it's an
enormous break for the case,

32:03.022 --> 32:04.690
BUT, LOOK, THERE'S STILL NO SIGN
OF THE BIG FISH,

32:04.723 --> 32:06.392
SO WHY DON'T YOU
AND GABRIEL SIT TIGHT?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.627
YOU'RE LIKELY TO SPOT
SOME MORE MIDDLEMEN

32:08.660 --> 32:13.632
'CAUSE I'M LOOKING AT A BUNCH
OF EMPTY CONTAINERS HERE,

32:13.665 --> 32:16.168
SO, ODDS ARE, MORE CARS
ARE GONNA BE LEAVING THE LOT.

32:16.202 --> 32:18.537
WE'LL WAIT FOR THEM HERE

32:18.570 --> 32:20.606
AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE TWO
SUSPECTS WE JUST APPREHENDED.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.374
UH, HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.411
BUZZ, DO AN INTERNET SEARCH
ON THE WORD "RECOLETA."

32:25.444 --> 32:28.147
SEE IF IT HAS SOME KIND OF
SPECIAL CONNECTION TO ARGENTINA.

32:30.649 --> 32:34.286
IN SPANISH,
RECOLETA MEANS "CALM,"

32:34.320 --> 32:37.356
BUT IT'S ALSO THE NAME OF
A NEIGHBORHOOD IN BUENOS AIRES.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.659
UM, HONEY,

32:40.692 --> 32:42.461
WHILE YOU'RE FINISHING UP

32:42.494 --> 32:47.299
WITH THOSE PEOPLE,
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

32:47.333 --> 32:48.767
A FAVOR?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.402
IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES,

32:50.436 --> 32:52.104
COULD YOU GIVE THE SUSPECTS
THEIR PHONE CALLS?

32:52.138 --> 32:54.240
WELL, IF I GIVE THE SUSPECTS
THEIR PHONE CALLS,

32:54.273 --> 32:56.275
THEY MIGHT ALERT
THE BIG FISH.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.577
THAT'S WHAT I'M COUNTING ON.
I HAVE TO HANG UP NOW.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.512
YEAH, WELL, HO--

33:02.248 --> 33:03.549
OKAY...

33:03.582 --> 33:05.017
BUZZ, WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL
FOR BACKUP?

33:05.051 --> 33:06.318
AND, DAVID,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.087
LET'S BE CAREFUL HERE.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.289
I WANT TO SCARE THIS GUY,
NOT START A SHOOTING MATCH.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.258
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.759
HEY, GUYS, HOLD ON A SECOND.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.795
THESE DIRTBAGS
HAVE TO MAKE SOME CALLS.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.734
WE'RE CLOSED.
DINNER STARTS AT 5:30.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.237
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT HUNGRY, REALLY.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.173
OH.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.207
IT'S YOU AGAIN.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.708
DID YOU FIND
YOUR FUGITIVE?

33:29.741 --> 33:34.446
NO, BUT, ACTUALLY, WE THINK
HE MAY STILL BE IN THE AREA.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.549
I'LL BE ON MY GUARD, THEN.
THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.453
EXCUSE ME.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.490
HMM?

33:51.330 --> 33:52.364
¿RECOLETA?

33:56.702 --> 33:59.271
SORRY.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.707
YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO ANSWER
A FEW QUESTIONS?

34:01.740 --> 34:05.344
SURE. I'M A-ALWAYS HAPPY
TO HELP THE POLICE.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.547
LET ME, UH, LET ME PUT THIS
IN MY OFFICE.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.284
I'LL BE BACK IN FIVE,
OKAY?

34:12.318 --> 34:15.821
I'LL WAIT HERE.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.656
OKAY.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.790
SIR,
I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE DAY.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.892
I'M ANXIOUS,
AND I'M STRESSED

34:53.925 --> 34:56.128
AND A LITTLE SHAKY.
AH-AH.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.797
SO, IF YOU DON'T DROP
YOUR GUN RIGHT NOW,

34:58.830 --> 35:00.499
I'M GONNA PUT A BULLET
THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.467
ARE WE CLEAR?

35:02.734 --> 35:03.902
THANK YOU.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.338
WHY?
WHY ARE YOU ARRESTING ME?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.807
'CAUSE SHOOTING YOU WOULD GET US
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.510
MATEO RíOS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.879
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU

35:13.912 --> 35:15.314
IN A COURT OF LAW.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.782
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.560
Man:
PLEASE BE SEATED.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.163
THE FAMILY OF TURELL BAYLOR
vs. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

35:31.197 --> 35:33.232
DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, ET AL,

35:33.265 --> 35:34.800
WE ARE BACK ON THE RECORD.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.337
BEFORE MY RULING,

35:38.370 --> 35:40.239
I'D LIKE IT KNOWN THAT,

35:40.272 --> 35:43.375
WHATEVER CRIMES
MR. BAYLOR MAY HAVE COMMITTED,

35:43.409 --> 35:46.178
HE WAS ENTITLED TO BE TRIED
IN A COURT,

35:46.212 --> 35:48.180
NOT THE STREETS OF L.A.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.389
MR. GOLDMAN,
THE LACK OF EVIDENCE

35:57.423 --> 36:00.792
SUPPORTING THE CENTRAL THESIS
BEHIND YOUR PLEADING

36:00.826 --> 36:05.564
LEAVES ME NO CHOICE BUT TO GRANT
THE DEFENSE ITS MOTION

36:05.597 --> 36:07.633
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.800
CASE DISMISSED.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.752
OOH. I TOLD YOU
I WAS GOING TO WIN.

36:26.785 --> 36:27.986
YOU MIGHT HAVE
TOLD ME HOW.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.855
WELL, THEN
YOU WOULD'VE TOLD THE LEAK,

36:29.888 --> 36:31.790
AND THEN
WHERE WOULD WE BE?

36:31.823 --> 36:35.627
I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT IT'S ALL OVER.

36:35.661 --> 36:36.928
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.398
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER CRISIS
SOON ENOUGH,

36:39.431 --> 36:42.568
AND I'LL LEAD US
ALL THROUGH THAT ONE, TOO.

36:42.601 --> 36:43.735
NOW, THAT'S JUST
WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.438
THANK YOU
FOR SHOWING US THE WAY.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.539
EVERYONE, TO GAVIN!

36:47.573 --> 36:48.874
OH, YES.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.476
OH, THANK YOU.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.710
TO GAVIN!

36:57.316 --> 36:58.617
CONGRATULATIONS, CHIEF.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.654
LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR...

37:02.688 --> 37:04.323
STANDING BY ME.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.957
I KNOW IT HASN'T
BEEN EASY.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.826
CHIEF,
IF OUR JOB WAS EASY,

37:07.859 --> 37:11.297
NO ONE WOULD
PUT UP WITH EITHER ONE OF US.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.533
YOU'RE NO MORE DIFFICULT
TO DEAL WITH THAN I AM.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.834
I MEAN THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.470
WELL, THANK YOU...
SHARON.

37:18.504 --> 37:21.440
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU.
I REALLY AM.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.810
YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.379
WILL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

37:27.413 --> 37:29.648
SOMETHING WRONG?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.650
I'M NOT SURE,

37:31.683 --> 37:33.719
BUT I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO SOMEONE

37:33.752 --> 37:35.521
WITHOUT LOSING
YOUR TEMPER.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.922
YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

37:36.955 --> 37:40.759
WELL, I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING,
BUT I'LL TRY.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.827
WHO IS IT?

37:43.529 --> 37:46.332
CONGRATULATIONS,
CHIEF JOHNSON.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.003
JUST BE SURE TO GET MORE
INFORMATION OUT OF HIM

37:52.037 --> 37:53.739
THAN HE GETS FROM US,
OKAY?

37:53.772 --> 37:54.873
OKAY.

37:56.475 --> 38:00.879
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
I'M TIMING YOU.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.481
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

38:02.514 --> 38:03.915
MY CRASHING
YOUR VICTORY PARTY.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.417
NOT AT ALL.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.919
GIVES ME A CHANCE TO SAY
MY FINAL GOODBYE.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.789
I LOOK FORWARD TO NEVER
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

38:10.822 --> 38:13.792
MAYBE I'M BORN
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.627
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

38:15.661 --> 38:19.798
BECAUSE AFTER LOSING IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY,

38:19.831 --> 38:22.701
I FILED A NEW CASE
ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.370
YOU DID?

38:24.403 --> 38:25.837
I DID.

38:25.871 --> 38:29.341
AND THIS LAWSUIT
ISN'T GOING TO BE FOCUSING

38:29.375 --> 38:32.744
ENTIRELY ON
TURELL BAYLOR'S DEATH...

38:32.778 --> 38:34.045
AS SHAMEFUL AS THAT WAS.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.981
NO.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.617
IT ALSO CONCERNS THE SON
OF A RUSSIAN CRIME BOSS,

38:38.650 --> 38:41.420
WHO WAS WORKING
AS AN FBI INFORMANT

38:41.453 --> 38:44.923
AND WHO DIED THE SAME NIGHT
YOU REVEALED THAT COOPERATION

38:44.956 --> 38:46.925
TO HIS FATHER'S LAWYER.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.494
OH, DID I MENTION

38:48.527 --> 38:50.629
THAT HE'D JUST BEEN RELEASED
FROM YOUR CUSTODY?

38:50.662 --> 38:53.832
AND THEN,
THERE WAS THE CHILD MOLESTER

38:53.865 --> 38:57.969
WHO YOU THREATENED TO PUT
INTO GENERAL POPULATION

38:58.003 --> 38:59.905
AFTER HE CONFESSED --
MR. STIMPLE --

38:59.938 --> 39:02.508
HANGED HIMSELF --

39:02.541 --> 39:03.875
AGAIN, IN CUSTODY.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.612
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE TREND
WITH YOU, ACTUALLY,

39:06.645 --> 39:08.480
BECAUSE A SHORT TIME
AFTERWARDS,

39:08.514 --> 39:12.150
YOU ARRESTED A POLICE OFFICER
FROM TIJUANA

39:12.183 --> 39:13.585
UNDER A FALSE NAME,

39:13.619 --> 39:15.554
WHO WAS THEN MURDERED
IN JAIL.

39:15.587 --> 39:18.957
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
A COINCIDENCE TO ME.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.027
THEN THERE WAS THE SUICIDE
IN YOUR INTERVIEW ROOM TODAY.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.764
NOT TO MENTION HOW YOU
CONTINUALLY HARASS MY COLLEAGUE,

39:25.797 --> 39:27.833
PHILLIP STROH,

39:27.866 --> 39:29.501
CALLING HIS CLIENTS,

39:29.535 --> 39:32.103
BAD-MOUTHING HIM TO
OTHER LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.440
PHILLIP STROH RAPED AND MURDERED
A YOUNG GIRL FROM MISSOURI

39:34.473 --> 39:35.774
THE NIGHT BEFORE
HER 30th BIRTHDAY.

39:35.807 --> 39:39.177
PROVE IT.
IN A COURT OF LAW.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.580
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU, FRANKLY.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.015
WHAT ONE KNOWS
AND WHAT ONE CAN PROVE

39:44.049 --> 39:45.717
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.486
YOU DON'T SEEM TO GET THAT.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.621
SO, YOU REPRESENT A MAN

39:49.655 --> 39:53.158
WHO CONFESSED
TO MURDERING PROSTITUTES,

39:53.191 --> 39:54.593
A CHILD MOLESTER,

39:54.626 --> 39:55.927
A POLICE OFFICER

39:55.961 --> 39:57.529
WHO WORKED WITH A DRUG CARTEL,
A RAPIST,

39:57.563 --> 39:59.831
AND A COP KILLER.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.533
THAT'S A PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE LIST

40:01.567 --> 40:03.201
TO ADD TO THE SAINTLY
TURELL BAYLOR.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.936
AND TOGETHER,
THEY ALL ADD UP

40:04.970 --> 40:07.806
TO A PAST PRACTICE
AND PATTERN

40:07.839 --> 40:10.609
OF DENYING SUSPECTS
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE

40:10.642 --> 40:11.910
TO A FAIR TRIAL.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.080
THAT IS A CIVIL RIGHTS
VIOLATION FOR WHICH YOU,

40:15.113 --> 40:18.450
THE L.A.P.D.,
AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES

40:18.484 --> 40:21.419
ARE GOING TO PAY...
DEARLY.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.626
MY TWO MINUTES ARE UP.

40:27.659 --> 40:33.031
BESIDES, I HAVE A VERY LARGE
DISCOVERY MOTION TO FILE.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.803
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, MR. GOLDMAN.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.838
DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
PERSONAL VENDETTA AGAINST ME?

40:39.871 --> 40:42.073
I MEAN, HAVE I EVER DONE
ANYTHING TO YOU

40:42.107 --> 40:43.675
OR

40:43.709 --> 40:45.811
NO.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.879
IN FACT,
I'M REASONABLY SURE

40:47.913 --> 40:50.482
WE HAVE ALMOST NEVER
CROSSED PATHS.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.850
BUT THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE

40:51.883 --> 40:54.019
I'M THE CONSCIENCE
OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM,

40:54.052 --> 40:57.055
WHICH, AS FAR
AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

40:57.088 --> 41:00.058
MAKES ME NEARLY
A PERFECT STRANGER.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.628
BUT DON'T WORRY.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.630
BY THE TIME I'M DONE,

41:04.663 --> 41:07.265
WE'RE GONNA KNOW EACH OTHER
VERY WELL.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.636
BECAUSE IT'S MY INTENTION,
CHIEF JOHNSON,

41:10.669 --> 41:13.772
TO PUT AN END TO YOU...

41:13.805 --> 41:17.108
AND ALL YOUR WORKS.
