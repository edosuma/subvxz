00:00.517 --> 00:02.219
<i>My name is Stephen Jameson.</i>

00:02.220 --> 00:03.923
<i>And I am one of</i>
<i>the Tomorrow People.</i>

00:03.924 --> 00:06.287
<i>They call our powers</i>
<i>the three T's.</i>

00:06.288 --> 00:07.693
<i>- Telepathy...</i>
<i>- Stephen?</i>

00:07.694 --> 00:10.289
<i>Telekinesis...</i>
<i>And teleportation.</i>

00:10.290 --> 00:13.453
<i>There is a shadow war going on</i>
<i>between us and Ultra...</i>

00:13.454 --> 00:15.776
- No!
<i>- The secret organization that hunts us.</i>

00:15.777 --> 00:18.343
<i>The only way to keep</i>
<i>my species from going extinct</i>

00:18.344 --> 00:19.719
<i>is to find my father.</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:22.856
<i>And the only way to do that</i>
<i>is by working for the enemy.</i>

00:24.175 --> 00:26.232
<i>Previously on</i>
The Tomorrow People...

00:26.233 --> 00:30.095
The Founder invented some kind of machine
to amplify your father's powers.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.930
- Machine for what?
- I don't know.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.633
But whatever it is, your father
risked death to stop it.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.268
- It's time to move forward.
- How?

00:36.269 --> 00:38.958
- Oh, you know very well.
- Stephen? No, he's not ready.

00:38.959 --> 00:39.943
The machine.

00:39.944 --> 00:42.961
Finding The Refuge is in the
best interest of both species.

00:42.962 --> 00:44.142
What do you
want me to do?

00:44.143 --> 00:46.878
You are the only one
who can take us there.

00:56.155 --> 00:57.556
Hey!

01:00.393 --> 01:02.027
Hey, where's your badge?

01:02.028 --> 01:04.163
It's supposed to be on
display at all times.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.525
Oh, come on, come on.

02:02.322 --> 02:06.024
Last night, Dr. Jedikiah
Price tried to sabotage

02:06.025 --> 02:09.928
the very organization he labored
all these years to build.

02:11.230 --> 02:14.466
He assaulted two of our
employees, one human,

02:15.368 --> 02:16.835
and one of our kind.

02:18.404 --> 02:21.773
No one here is safe from
his deranged reprisals.

02:23.342 --> 02:27.979
I had hoped that we would all be
able to forget your old superior

02:27.980 --> 02:29.347
and his brutal regime.

02:30.583 --> 02:34.953
That we could recommit to the
study and protection of our kind.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.623
But he has left us with no choice.

02:39.358 --> 02:42.494
I want Dr. Price brought to me,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.529
and brought to justice!

02:49.569 --> 02:51.937
Stephen, come into my office.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.474
<i>John, The Founder just
called open season on my uncle.</i>

02:55.475 --> 02:57.307
<i>He could lead them straight
to my dad's body.</i>

02:57.308 --> 02:58.708
I'm on it.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.849
Listen, I just wanted
to say that I realize

03:03.850 --> 03:06.084
Jedikiah's arrest might
be difficult for you.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.819
Yeah, not as much
as you might think.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.489
Well, nevertheless, first losing
your father, and now...

03:10.490 --> 03:12.357
I'd like another chance
in that machine of yours.

03:12.358 --> 03:16.928
Well, I admire your zeal,
but, if you're to do so,

03:16.929 --> 03:20.699
there's one skill that you must master,
that only you can master.

03:21.567 --> 03:22.734
Stopping time.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.402
Now, as I understand,

03:24.403 --> 03:27.772
you've only stopped time at moments
of emotional duress, never by will?

03:27.773 --> 03:29.508
What does that have to
do with the machine?

03:29.509 --> 03:34.179
See, the machine opens a portal to a
world in which only our kind can live.

03:34.780 --> 03:38.283
Stopping time allows you to
pass through the threshold.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.068
If I get there, is it
possible to come back?

03:43.389 --> 03:46.150
Well, why would anyone want
to come back from paradise?

03:47.493 --> 03:48.894
When do we begin?

03:50.229 --> 03:53.398
You must hone all of your powers,
since they're all connected.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.801
Meaning, when you
strengthen one ability...

03:58.437 --> 04:00.405
You strengthen
all of them.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.475
<i>I thought you said
this was going to be difficult.</i>

04:03.476 --> 04:06.077
Oh, two powers at once.

04:06.078 --> 04:08.213
That's very good.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.814
Now, try teleporting.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.358
You're supposed to be training
Stephen, not coddling him.

04:21.694 --> 04:22.961
Yes, sir.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.430
Keep it up.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.836
Why are you killing yourself?

04:33.372 --> 04:34.673
What is so important?

04:34.674 --> 04:37.209
Firing up this machine.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.078
You just have to trust me, okay?
It's something I have to do.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.848
You don't have to burn
yourself out on the first day.

04:45.851 --> 04:47.552
Is your mom working tonight?

04:48.354 --> 04:49.487
Yeah.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.723
Where's your brother?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.125
Soccer tournament.

04:54.126 --> 04:55.460
Oh.

04:56.495 --> 04:58.029
Well, I was thinking that
maybe I could come over

04:58.030 --> 05:00.932
and we could approach training
from a different angle.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.629
What kind of angle?

05:05.256 --> 05:07.472
Oh, see, I was thinking
that maybe we could...

05:10.009 --> 05:12.444
Boss told me to swap
you out, Agent Cole.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.246
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Doesn't take much.

05:16.415 --> 05:17.682
Good luck.

05:27.426 --> 05:28.493
Hey, hey!

05:29.629 --> 05:31.296
It's me.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.131
Okay.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.466
Sorry.

05:40.172 --> 05:42.574
Heard about your
break-in at Ultra.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.010
Desperate times, John.
Desperate times.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.713
- Time to go.
- No, no!

05:49.882 --> 05:51.616
Sorry, not leaving him.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.886
The Founder's put a
bounty on your head.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.055
You want to protect
your brother?

05:57.056 --> 05:59.157
You need to get as far away
from him as possible.

05:59.158 --> 06:02.227
We swore that whatever happens to us,
we go through it together, sorry.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.998
If Roger ever returns,
you'll be the first person he thanks.

06:06.999 --> 06:10.701
Well, that's fantastic.
But I just spent six years in hell.

06:10.702 --> 06:12.871
So it's gonna take a little
more than an apology.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.572
All the more reason
to stay here, John.

06:14.573 --> 06:16.642
You can help me guard him,
I'm not leaving him.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.210
Listen to me.
It is not safe.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.247
If what Stephen said is
true, we need to leave now!

06:22.248 --> 06:25.517
Stephen is very confused, and he has
no idea what he's saying right now,

06:25.518 --> 06:27.352
I'm not leaving.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.655
Help me.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.561
Please.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.571
Okay, chocolates.

06:47.172 --> 06:50.008
- Too many candles, way too many candles.
<i>- Stephen?</i>

06:50.009 --> 06:52.243
Jedikiah won't leave
your father's side.

06:52.878 --> 06:54.345
Ultra is hunting Jedikiah.

06:54.346 --> 06:56.614
Well, John's got a soft
spot for your uncle.

06:56.615 --> 07:00.385
- My uncle is manipulating him.
- <i>At least now, Roger's safe.</i>

07:00.386 --> 07:01.820
Now he's got two bodyguards.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.689
Cara, I gotta go.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.157
Uh, come on in, it's open.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.295
You're early.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.432
Ah, you shouldn't have.

07:14.433 --> 07:17.769
I was just about
to burn my house down.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.305
What's going on?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.574
Nice work today, Stephen.

07:22.575 --> 07:26.878
Thank you, but, uh, something tells me
you're not here to pat me on the back.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.882
The, uh, Tomorrow People.
John and Cara.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.652
I assume you're still in contact.

07:33.653 --> 07:38.757
The only reason I ask is I want
to formalize our ceasefire.

07:38.758 --> 07:42.226
The shadow war between Ultra
and all paranormals is over.

07:42.227 --> 07:44.028
Okay, uh...
I'll let them know.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.964
I'd prefer to meet with them myself.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.166
Convince them of my intentions.

07:48.167 --> 07:52.437
Yeah, that would be nice, but the last time
John was in Ultra, you tortured him.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.605
And John murdered your father.

07:54.606 --> 07:56.176
War is a nasty business, Stephen,

07:56.177 --> 07:58.033
and the quicker we put
an end to it, the better.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.980
I'd like their answer
as soon as possible.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.314
Okay.

08:07.219 --> 08:10.021
- Oh, you mean now?
- Yes, now.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.624
And, Stephen...

08:13.226 --> 08:16.474
If I were to discover that
anyone is aiding Jedikiah,

08:16.475 --> 08:19.020
helping your uncle elude capture...

08:20.099 --> 08:21.266
What?

08:22.868 --> 08:25.336
I would be supremely disappointed.

08:27.998 --> 08:30.798

08:41.662 --> 08:43.897
The Founder can't be that
interested in a peace summit

08:43.898 --> 08:45.598
if he's already making threats.

08:45.599 --> 08:48.368
He wants Jedikiah's head on
a spike, who can blame him?

08:48.369 --> 08:50.470
So you're betting on the Founder?

08:51.772 --> 08:53.740
Better the devil we know.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.776
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
both the Founder and Jedikiah...

08:56.777 --> 08:58.044
<i>Can suck it.</i>

09:01.615 --> 09:02.982
I've been teaching him slang.

09:02.983 --> 09:05.285
I don't trust either of them,

09:05.286 --> 09:09.022
but the Founder is the only one who can
teach me how to master the machine.

09:09.023 --> 09:10.757
So he says.

09:11.892 --> 09:14.160
I think I figured out how
to bring my father back.

09:14.161 --> 09:15.428
How?

09:15.429 --> 09:17.664
If I can use the machine
to get into limbo...

09:18.599 --> 09:20.734
- I can bring him home.
- Are you high?

09:20.735 --> 09:22.936
Let's just think
about this for a minute.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.840
Your father was shot, we take him out of
cryostasis, he still has a bullet in him.

09:26.841 --> 09:29.976
I know, I am working on that,
but until we figure it out

09:29.977 --> 09:32.311
I say we play nice with the Founder.

09:32.312 --> 09:34.581
His offer still sounds
too good to be true.

09:34.582 --> 09:37.805
<i>Sorry to interrupt, but your
partner has been texting you.</i>

09:37.806 --> 09:39.840
<i>I'm not familiar with that slang.</i>

09:39.841 --> 09:41.922
<i>I'm putting her messages

09:41.923 --> 09:44.190
No, no, no, no!
No, thank you!

09:44.191 --> 09:45.391
See you guys.

09:45.392 --> 09:47.627
Uh, "can't wait to" what?

09:52.399 --> 09:53.533
Hi.

09:53.534 --> 09:55.235
I thought we had a date.

09:55.236 --> 09:56.402
Hey.

09:56.403 --> 09:58.304
Um, yeah, I'm sorry, I...

09:58.305 --> 10:01.541
It's fine if you want me
to leave, I can leave.

10:03.711 --> 10:06.045
No, no, I, uh...

10:06.046 --> 10:07.247
I'm definitely...

10:08.516 --> 10:11.417
I definitely don't want you to go.

10:11.418 --> 10:13.720
That would be the worst.

10:18.392 --> 10:20.193
- You gonna get that?
- No.

10:21.695 --> 10:24.030
You sure you don't want to get that?

10:24.031 --> 10:25.899
I'm turning my phone off.

10:27.034 --> 10:30.904
Okay, it's Astrid.
Uh, just one second.

10:30.905 --> 10:32.739
Uh... hey, hey!

10:32.740 --> 10:34.607
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

10:34.608 --> 10:36.242
I ordered double moo sho...

10:36.243 --> 10:39.045
Uh, yeah, I'm kind of, uh... busy.

10:39.947 --> 10:41.915
"Kind of busy?" Awesome.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.917
- Who's that?
- Astrid, uh... Next time, I promise.

10:43.918 --> 10:45.451
Okay, bye.

10:45.452 --> 10:46.786
Please, don't go.

10:46.787 --> 10:49.689
- I literally got all dressed up, and...
- You...

10:50.424 --> 10:51.925
look...

10:51.926 --> 10:53.693
incredible.

10:58.599 --> 11:01.501
What...
What is this to you?

11:02.636 --> 11:06.673
Um, what, uh, this to you?

11:06.674 --> 11:10.276
I really don't want to get messed up
over something that you are just...

11:10.277 --> 11:12.046
No, it's not that.

11:12.047 --> 11:15.915
And until I figure out how to stop time,
I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it.

11:35.603 --> 11:37.971
Hey, I got your message.
Is everything okay?

11:37.972 --> 11:42.008
Yeah, I just, uh, over-ordered and
didn't want it to go to waste.

11:42.676 --> 11:44.310
And then I ate it all, so...

11:45.746 --> 11:48.748
I was just expecting Stephen to show.

11:51.285 --> 11:53.119
He stood you up.

11:54.321 --> 11:56.789
It's not like we had
a date, but, you know,

11:56.790 --> 11:59.492
we have this standing
late-night dumpling thing.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.295
Mmm, but now that
he's busy with Hillary...

12:02.296 --> 12:03.796
Hillary?

12:03.797 --> 12:05.865
It's just, of all people
to be hooking up with...

12:05.866 --> 12:07.500
What?

12:07.501 --> 12:11.671
Stephen's having sex with the
Ultra agent who tried to kill me?

12:15.676 --> 12:16.843
Oh.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.079
How can he trust her?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.581
That's what I've been saying.

12:22.416 --> 12:24.750
What if she's trying to use him?

12:24.751 --> 12:26.686
She's certainly distracting him.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.858
Why don't you read her mind
to find out what's going on?

12:31.859 --> 12:33.326
It's not that easy.

12:33.327 --> 12:36.162
I'd have to get her alone,
I'd have to get her away from Ultra.

12:37.097 --> 12:38.331
Well.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.567
You know, you do have
an underground hideout.

12:45.039 --> 12:47.540
Astrid, you are brilliant.

12:53.614 --> 12:56.916
Let's say I do agree to the
summit with your new boss.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.584
I thought you were against it?

12:58.585 --> 13:02.388
It is the best way to test if the
Founder's truce is real, right?

13:02.389 --> 13:05.725
All righty, then. Which lamb
should we send to the slaughter?

13:05.726 --> 13:07.460
- You.
- How now?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.996
Aren't you always
begging to go topside?

13:09.997 --> 13:13.333
Shouldn't we send
someone more expendable?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.336
I want to let the Founder know
I'm willing to meet him halfway.

13:16.337 --> 13:20.206
But I am not sending my top lieutenant in
without getting some collateral first.

13:20.207 --> 13:21.474
Top lieutenant?

13:21.475 --> 13:23.509
What kind of collateral?

13:23.510 --> 13:25.211
An agent he values.

13:26.947 --> 13:28.481
Okay, I'll let him know.

13:28.482 --> 13:29.649
I want Hillary.

13:29.650 --> 13:31.284
Your partner?

13:36.324 --> 13:38.324
That's not a problem, is it?

13:39.593 --> 13:40.994
Nope.

13:47.768 --> 13:50.837
I was just thinking about the last
time the three of us were together.

13:50.838 --> 13:53.940
I should've known better to
play paintball with you two.

13:55.809 --> 13:58.494
I'm not here to swap memories.

13:58.495 --> 14:01.647
Listen, John, there's something
you need to understand.

14:01.648 --> 14:03.727
We can't let Roger get
put in that machine.

14:04.118 --> 14:04.930
Why is that?

14:04.931 --> 14:08.665
Because it's a weapon, he was supposed
to be its engine, that's why he left.

14:10.955 --> 14:12.325
Okay.

14:12.326 --> 14:14.727
Listen to me, John, this
is very, very important,

14:14.728 --> 14:16.963
if it looks like Ultra
is going to take us...

14:20.334 --> 14:22.635
We have to destroy Roger ourselves.

14:27.274 --> 14:29.609
You really have gone crazy,
haven't you?

14:29.610 --> 14:31.210
First, you want me to protect him.

14:31.211 --> 14:33.312
Now, you want me to
kill him all over again.

14:33.313 --> 14:35.515
Okay, it is imperative
that the Founder...

14:35.516 --> 14:39.452
Would you just please be quiet.

14:40.154 --> 14:43.133
He won't get ahold of Roger,
and no one's gonna die.

14:48.328 --> 14:52.440
Okay, everyone down there's pretty
cool and, um, just don't be nervous.

14:52.866 --> 14:54.100
I'm not nervous.

14:55.169 --> 14:59.005
- Are you nervous?
- No. No. You're gonna be fine.

15:00.007 --> 15:02.975
This isn't my first time behind
enemy lines, you know that, right?

15:02.976 --> 15:04.410
Yeah.

15:05.679 --> 15:08.481
So how did you find a bunch
of paranormal rebels anyway?

15:08.482 --> 15:10.886
I didn't, they found me.

15:11.351 --> 15:13.286
- Like a lost puppy?
- Yeah.

15:13.787 --> 15:18.825
Cara found me, we, uh, had this
connection, like, psychically.

15:19.493 --> 15:21.227
I see.

15:21.528 --> 15:23.696
And how deep did
that connection go?

15:23.697 --> 15:27.867
When I thought I was losing my mind,
she showed me I wasn't.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.302
So you slept with her?

15:30.971 --> 15:32.538
Uh, what, how did...

15:34.575 --> 15:36.509
Once. That was it.

15:37.444 --> 15:40.847
Hillary, I'm sorry
to do this, but, um...

15:42.649 --> 15:44.750
Really?
Cara's orders.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.387
This is gonna be fun.

15:54.962 --> 15:55.995
Cara.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.463
Hillary.

15:59.266 --> 16:00.733
- Ready, baby?
- Yeah.

16:00.734 --> 16:01.734
Let's do it.

16:01.735 --> 16:03.035
Wait.

16:09.143 --> 16:10.476
Hurry back.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.349
Can I get you something to drink?

16:18.051 --> 16:21.154
Why don't you just take a look
at what you really want to see?

16:22.122 --> 16:24.056
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:24.758 --> 16:26.092
Go for it.

16:45.078 --> 16:46.345
Yeah.

16:46.346 --> 16:48.104
Oh. that's not what you
were looking for?

16:48.911 --> 16:50.703
But my favorite part is coming up.

16:53.183 --> 16:54.743
How about that drink?

17:01.695 --> 17:03.763
Mr. Bathory.

17:03.764 --> 17:05.498
Ah.

17:05.499 --> 17:08.034
- Where's John and Cara?
- Actually, um...

17:08.669 --> 17:10.736
You got Kwon!

17:10.737 --> 17:11.904
Russell Kwon.

17:15.309 --> 17:18.144
Try to contain your excitement.

17:18.145 --> 17:20.713
Ah, you must be here
as their emissary.

17:21.448 --> 17:22.748
I don't know what that means.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.219
Before we begin, would you
like a bite of something?

17:26.220 --> 17:29.722
I hate working on an empty stomach.

17:34.127 --> 17:36.762
Beluga caviar?
Yum.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.411
What's the beverage sitch?

17:42.268 --> 17:45.938
Dr. Price wanted to neuter paranormals
because he was jealous of our powers.

17:45.939 --> 17:49.041
<i>- Good evening, sir.</i>
<i>- Hello, nurse.</i>

17:50.464 --> 17:53.865
<i>As you can see, I run an entirely
different organization.</i>

17:53.866 --> 17:56.997
It's Dr. Price who prevented
peace between our camps.

17:56.998 --> 18:00.386
But now, with him gone, we can
move forward. As we are now.

18:00.387 --> 18:03.856
- Shoulder to shoulder. Refill?
- You read my mind, bro.

18:04.992 --> 18:07.560
To putting the past behind us.

18:07.561 --> 18:11.264
We will happily forget
all previous indiscretions.

18:12.032 --> 18:13.699
What indiscretions?

18:13.700 --> 18:15.034
Mmm.

18:15.035 --> 18:19.672
Uh, for instance, the time that you
teleported into the Capital Bank.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.707
Ancient history.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.613
Look, Founder guy, this
truce sounds dope, but...

18:27.614 --> 18:30.716
It wouldn't be the first
time Ultra pulled a fast one.

18:30.717 --> 18:35.721
Of course, but I'm sure that Mr. Bathory can
offer you some kind of assurances, right?

18:37.190 --> 18:38.891
I can give you my word.

18:40.827 --> 18:42.295
It's the best I can offer.

18:42.296 --> 18:45.698
Is that a rose 2014 edition?

18:45.699 --> 18:47.233
Good eye.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.905
And, as a token of my good will...

18:55.409 --> 18:56.909
Go on, it's yours.

19:05.485 --> 19:09.522
Now, uh, this, uh, tracer that
I've heard so much about.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.490
Oh, you mean the
ticket to the Refuge?

19:11.491 --> 19:15.027
The one you've been
drinking for the last hour.

19:18.465 --> 19:20.866
I'm only kidding.

19:20.867 --> 19:23.703
You don't really believe that
I would ruin a '62 Bordeaux

19:23.704 --> 19:26.372
with electromagnetic
compounds, do you?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.847
I don't know, would you?

19:47.762 --> 19:49.329
Russell, what took you so long?

19:49.330 --> 19:51.398
Uh, give me a sec, balance is off.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.666
You're bleeding!

19:52.667 --> 19:56.436
This? Oh, no, it's red wine.

19:59.173 --> 20:01.374
Listen up, people.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.076
The Founder...

20:03.077 --> 20:05.311
is totally cool.

20:07.348 --> 20:08.681
And the truce offer?

20:08.682 --> 20:09.783
Legit.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.520
The war is over.

20:14.722 --> 20:15.789
Okay.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.290
Okay. Okay!

20:18.426 --> 20:20.260
I understand that
everyone is excited,

20:20.261 --> 20:23.063
but we are not making
any decisions until John gets back.

20:28.903 --> 20:32.105
I'm guessing time didn't just stop.

20:37.978 --> 20:39.546
You're far too green.

20:39.547 --> 20:41.214
I'll get there.

20:41.215 --> 20:42.849
Perhaps.

20:42.850 --> 20:47.053
It took your father four years to even
come close to mastering his abilities.

20:47.054 --> 20:49.823
I don't have four years,
put me back in the machine.

20:49.824 --> 20:52.759
Stephen, the machine takes
an incredible toll on your system.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.528
You try to use it fully
before you're ready?

20:56.363 --> 20:58.106
It'll be the last thing you ever do.

20:58.107 --> 20:59.099
Now, again.

21:06.874 --> 21:10.343
You didn't, by any chance, drop
Hillary on the train tracks, did you?

21:10.344 --> 21:12.612
Jealousy is an ugly thing.

21:12.613 --> 21:13.813
Mmm-hmm.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.786
Well, I'm not going
to let my guard down

21:15.787 --> 21:18.158
just because you got wined
and dined by the Founder.

21:18.159 --> 21:19.819
Also got a really dope watch.

21:21.722 --> 21:23.490
I'm joking, Cara.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.192
Look, whatever the Founder
is playing at,

21:26.193 --> 21:29.496
a peace offering is more
than Jedikiah ever gave us.

21:30.564 --> 21:32.732
I know that you want
to believe that.

21:32.733 --> 21:35.702
Do you know what I would
do if this war was over?

21:36.437 --> 21:39.139
I would go home.
See my mom.

21:40.107 --> 21:42.509
Hook up with Talia,
fight the good fight.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.645
And maybe take down a couple
of casinos along the way.

21:45.646 --> 21:49.115
But, I just... I want to
make something of my life.

21:50.651 --> 21:51.851
Don't you?

21:54.722 --> 21:56.422
I don't know what to say.

21:56.423 --> 21:57.824
Say...

21:57.825 --> 22:00.727
That we can take this
truce on a test drive.

22:01.896 --> 22:06.099
Tonight, Tomorrow People and
Ultra, a little <i>soiree,</i>

22:06.100 --> 22:09.636
see if former adversaries
can rub elbows.

22:11.205 --> 22:14.374
The last time we all went topside,

22:15.276 --> 22:17.043
Ultra agents killed three of our own.

22:17.678 --> 22:19.078
I know.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.715
I am not gonna let
that happen this time.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.983
I promise.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.354
Keep it small.

22:43.370 --> 22:44.838
John know he's missing this?

22:44.839 --> 22:47.740
Yeah, and I wish
I could join him.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.577
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.846
Oh, Stephen...
This is a celebration.

22:52.847 --> 22:54.881
You're dancing with me, I'll
embarrass you, I don't even care.

22:54.882 --> 22:56.149
I know you will.

22:57.952 --> 23:00.086
Is this what you do at home
in front of the mirror?

23:03.057 --> 23:04.390
Don't do that.

23:15.302 --> 23:16.569
Hey.

23:17.571 --> 23:19.172
Did you have to invite her?

23:22.176 --> 23:24.711
Everything will be fine, okay?
I promise.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.754
Did you find anything out
from reading her mind?

23:34.755 --> 23:36.556
Nothing I want to remember.

23:36.557 --> 23:38.591
You think this is gonna work?

23:39.360 --> 23:40.693
We found a way to make it work.

23:40.694 --> 23:41.895
So can they.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.612
Come on, buy me a drink.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.655
Sir.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.591
That list of properties belonging
to Dr. Price's holding company.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.334
Seems like he had a thing
for rundown real estate.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.502
Hmm.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.308
It seems he purchased
this one six years ago.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.143
That supposed to mean something?

24:31.612 --> 24:32.812
Check it out.

24:36.050 --> 24:37.550
And, Agent Verras...

24:38.585 --> 24:40.353
Take a tactical team, will you?

24:51.732 --> 24:54.167
Okay, I gotta call it a night.

24:54.168 --> 24:55.368
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Why?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.503
Astrid? She's been
glaring at me all night.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.687
Well, you did try
and have her killed.

24:59.688 --> 25:01.650
I said I was sorry.

25:01.651 --> 25:04.051
I know, just be nice to her, okay?

25:04.052 --> 25:05.311
Okay.

25:05.312 --> 25:07.511
And I gotta be up early for training.

25:07.512 --> 25:08.699
Oh, what?

25:08.700 --> 25:12.362
Are you saying that all of this is less
interesting than the Founder's machine?

25:12.753 --> 25:16.199
No, I am definitely,
definitely not saying that.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.081
Mmm-hmm?

25:17.082 --> 25:19.905
All right? But it's not
just some machine.

25:20.327 --> 25:21.858
It's, um...

25:24.598 --> 25:26.032
No, it's okay.

25:26.433 --> 25:29.856
Whatever it does, I know that
it's really important to you.

25:31.538 --> 25:32.939
Just go.

25:32.940 --> 25:36.142
Because I'm gonna put you
through the ringer tomorrow.

25:36.977 --> 25:38.144
Promise?

25:38.145 --> 25:39.345
Mmm-hmm.

26:05.139 --> 26:07.440
On your knees! On your knees!

26:16.717 --> 26:17.984
I can't let you do that.

26:50.084 --> 26:51.951
What is this place?

26:52.820 --> 26:53.986
Get off him.

26:57.257 --> 26:59.292
Kill him, John.

26:59.293 --> 27:00.593
Kill him now.

27:07.101 --> 27:09.435
Are you out of your mind?

27:10.204 --> 27:12.605
What is wrong with you?

27:12.606 --> 27:13.940
Oh, my god.

27:14.908 --> 27:16.757
All right, wait a minute.
Wait, let me think.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.311
Okay, reinforcements are
gonna be here any second.

27:19.312 --> 27:20.998
You gotta call Stephen
and your friends, now!

27:20.999 --> 27:23.439
And destroy any chance
we have of a truce?

27:23.440 --> 27:25.567
Do you have any idea
what we've sacrificed...

27:25.568 --> 27:27.718
What you sacrificed?
What do you think I sacrificed?

27:27.719 --> 27:30.622
I had a life! I made a promise
to protect my brother!

27:31.592 --> 27:33.706
All right, that's the tactical team.

27:33.707 --> 27:35.388
- Call Stephen now.
- No.

27:35.389 --> 27:38.131
Call him now,
or I swear to God, I end Roger.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.101
Jed!

27:54.951 --> 27:58.187
<i>John, it's just me.</i>
<i>I've brought some provisions.</i>

28:04.728 --> 28:06.696
John? Jedikiah?

28:13.236 --> 28:14.236
No.

28:14.237 --> 28:17.740
No, no, no.
No. No.

28:17.741 --> 28:19.308
Jedikiah!

28:20.711 --> 28:21.911
John!

28:22.779 --> 28:23.913
<i>Stephen, what's wrong?</i>

28:23.914 --> 28:25.081
<i>There's blood everywhere.</i>

28:25.082 --> 28:26.949
<i>- My dad's body...</i>
<i>- Where's John?</i>

28:26.950 --> 28:28.417
He's gone.

28:28.418 --> 28:30.152
He's gone, they're all gone.

28:34.925 --> 28:37.393
Well, look who the cat dragged in.

28:37.394 --> 28:38.561
What happened?

28:39.329 --> 28:41.163
An unfortunate turn of events.

28:41.164 --> 28:44.273
Seems your old chum, John,
has been aiding your uncle.

28:44.602 --> 28:46.543
No wonder we haven't
been able to find him.

28:46.544 --> 28:50.400
Strange bedfellows after all
that's transpired between them.

28:50.401 --> 28:51.974
Where are they?
Did we capture them?

28:51.975 --> 28:54.877
Well, no, that would have
been fortunate, they escaped.

28:54.878 --> 28:56.746
Apparently, with a parcel.

28:57.848 --> 28:59.112
Of what?

28:59.113 --> 29:04.835
Well, Agent Verras here claims
that he saw a frozen corpse.

29:06.523 --> 29:10.993
Your uncle is a desperate man, who knows
what crazy schemes he's concocted,

29:10.994 --> 29:13.829
but I cannot believe that
John would jeopardize

29:13.830 --> 29:16.399
the end of a brutal war
for the sake of Jedikiah.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.701
- Okay, I can fix this.
- Well, I hope so, Stephen.

29:18.702 --> 29:21.404
I really do, because otherwise,
the truce is over,

29:21.405 --> 29:23.272
and I will be forced to go after John

29:23.273 --> 29:28.411
and all of his allies in a way that
will make the old Ultra seem meek.

29:34.718 --> 29:35.885
Stephen.

29:36.853 --> 29:38.254
- I'm sorry, we were ambushed.
- What happened?

29:38.555 --> 29:41.724
My dad's body,
what did you do with him?

29:42.926 --> 29:45.294
John, where is he?

29:46.897 --> 29:49.098
He's here.
He's here.

30:03.246 --> 30:05.581
- Is he, uh...
- Still viable?

30:05.582 --> 30:06.849
Just barely.

30:07.651 --> 30:10.219
- You son of a bitch! Get away from him!
- What did I just say, Stephen?

30:10.220 --> 30:13.622
We have a limited amount of time to
resuscitate him and bring him back,

30:13.623 --> 30:15.558
and for that,
you're gonna need me, kid.

30:15.559 --> 30:17.226
How much time do we have?

30:17.227 --> 30:20.930
Enough time to stop arguing and start
working together, get me more ice, please.

30:22.899 --> 30:26.635
If you want the war to end, you gotta
bring him back and kill the Founder.

30:26.636 --> 30:28.938
Don't do it for me,
do it for him.

30:32.476 --> 30:33.843
What do you need?

30:35.679 --> 30:37.346
A capable nurse.

30:40.817 --> 30:43.219
Why can't you tell me
what's going on, John?

30:43.220 --> 30:45.154
You need to see for yourself.

30:45.155 --> 30:48.791
Most people requiring surgical
supplies also require a hospital.

30:50.794 --> 30:52.361
It's not Stephen, is it?

30:52.362 --> 30:53.829
No.

30:56.399 --> 30:58.000
John, talk to me.

31:02.706 --> 31:06.742
Look, whatever it is,
it's going to be okay.

31:07.344 --> 31:08.644
You don't know that.

31:14.518 --> 31:16.118
You're right, I don't.

31:17.087 --> 31:20.723
I guess it's just
something mothers say.

31:22.893 --> 31:24.326
You ready?

31:25.295 --> 31:26.829
Dumb question.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.375
Hey.

31:40.043 --> 31:41.477
Hey, honey.
What is it?

31:45.782 --> 31:48.851
Mom, I'm sorry to bring
you down here like this.

31:55.992 --> 31:57.760
I don't understand.

32:02.165 --> 32:03.799
We need your help.

32:06.369 --> 32:08.070
Oh, my god.

32:13.862 --> 32:15.329
Come on, ladies.

32:15.330 --> 32:18.486
A little Russell glue will
bond us all together.

32:18.487 --> 32:20.420
Russell, what are you doing?
Hillary can't be down here.

32:20.421 --> 32:24.672
The war is over, we're
all <i>hakuna matata</i> with Ultra.

32:24.673 --> 32:26.307
I think you mean kumbaya.

32:26.308 --> 32:27.775
- Wrong movie.
- Stephen.

32:27.776 --> 32:30.288
We have a situation.

32:30.942 --> 32:32.032
What the hell is...

32:32.033 --> 32:34.992
- Wait, is that...
- Yeah.

32:34.993 --> 32:36.241
John, I need more light.

32:36.242 --> 32:37.418
Yes, ma'am.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.210
What can I do?

32:39.545 --> 32:41.235
I need everything on this list.

32:41.236 --> 32:42.640
- Astrid?
- Marla?

32:42.641 --> 32:45.469
Oh, great, Jedikiah's back,
that makes sense.

32:45.470 --> 32:47.480
Let me know when you're done
prepping so I can start, okay?

32:47.481 --> 32:48.734
You can start?

32:50.289 --> 32:53.771
Well, I'm a PhD in Genetics. I've studied
with the best doctors in the world,

32:53.772 --> 32:55.368
How many surgeries
have you performed?

32:55.369 --> 32:57.831
'Cause I've assisted on hundreds,
so if we're done comparing CVs,

32:57.832 --> 32:59.815
I need you to put this on because
we need to get this bullet out

32:59.816 --> 33:01.284
before his body
temperature normalizes.

33:01.643 --> 33:03.210
Copy that.

33:04.345 --> 33:06.339
- But your dad... I thought that you...
- I know.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.738
It's complicated, okay?

33:07.739 --> 33:09.726
I didn't mean to drag you into
this, you shouldn't even be here.

33:09.727 --> 33:11.502
- Stephen?
- We are not doing that!

33:11.503 --> 33:13.720
What's wrong? Nothing, Marla
hasn't started the surgery yet.

33:13.721 --> 33:15.622
But I think your father's
been under too long.

33:15.623 --> 33:18.091
Even if your mother and I
can resuscitate his body,

33:18.092 --> 33:21.227
- I think you may have to guide him back.
- It is too dangerous.

33:21.228 --> 33:23.630
He wants to kill you again
so you can get your dad.

33:23.631 --> 33:26.066
- I'm sorry, kill who?
- Okay, there's another way.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.034
I need to get into
the machine at Ultra.

33:28.035 --> 33:32.572
Look, if you power that up, everything your
father worked to stop could come to pass.

33:34.508 --> 33:36.676
Stephen.
I'm begging you.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.583
I can do this.

33:44.685 --> 33:45.885
Jameson!

33:47.855 --> 33:49.022
I want to help.

33:49.023 --> 33:52.692
- No. No, I can't put you in danger.
- I can't risk losing you.

33:52.693 --> 33:54.527
Hillary, this isn't your fight.

33:57.298 --> 33:58.498
Yes, it is.

34:18.418 --> 34:19.719
Okay.

34:22.922 --> 34:25.058
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- No.

34:25.059 --> 34:28.360
But if anyone comes through that door,
you get the hell out of here, okay?

34:28.362 --> 34:29.661
Okay.

35:12.573 --> 35:13.873
Dad?

35:23.017 --> 35:24.417
Stephen.

35:24.418 --> 35:27.220
- Stay back, something's wrong.
- Dad, what is this place?

35:27.922 --> 35:29.489
Don't you recognize our home?

35:32.793 --> 35:34.227
I said stay back.

35:38.599 --> 35:40.834
No, I need to bring you back now.

35:41.769 --> 35:43.703
- We had to pull you out...
- Stop.

35:43.704 --> 35:45.205
Out of cryostasis.

35:45.873 --> 35:47.640
You only have a few minutes.

35:47.641 --> 35:48.908
Wait...

35:50.611 --> 35:52.312
Okay, I'm cutting.

36:11.365 --> 36:12.251
What's happening?

36:12.252 --> 36:14.313
A door shorted out.
I just called maintenance.

36:14.314 --> 36:15.714
No, I'll handle this.

36:16.503 --> 36:17.670
Meet me there.

36:19.473 --> 36:21.274
Dad, come on.

36:21.275 --> 36:22.976
You gotta come with me.
I know this feels like home...

36:22.977 --> 36:25.445
But it's not, okay?

36:25.446 --> 36:27.780
- Come with me.
- You need to let me go.

36:27.781 --> 36:29.582
No. Come on. Get up.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.584
What? What?

36:31.585 --> 36:33.820
I don't know.

36:33.821 --> 36:35.822
- Did you nick a blood vessel?
- No.

36:35.823 --> 36:37.790
His core temperature
is changing too quickly.

36:37.791 --> 36:40.193
Well, there's a lot
of blood there, Marla.

36:41.028 --> 36:43.162
Dad.

36:47.701 --> 36:49.068
Stephen.

37:06.071 --> 37:07.549
Come on.
Come on.

37:08.407 --> 37:10.071
Epi and atropine.

37:11.109 --> 37:13.104
No! No!

37:18.350 --> 37:19.911
No, Dad!

37:21.353 --> 37:22.520
Get up.

37:23.021 --> 37:25.323
Come on!

37:25.324 --> 37:26.757
Dad!

37:26.758 --> 37:29.079
My body's not ready, I can't.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.262
Dad! What about Mom?

37:31.964 --> 37:33.741
What about Luca?

37:33.742 --> 37:35.318
What about me?

37:35.319 --> 37:37.535
Okay? Now, get up!
Come on.

37:38.136 --> 37:39.337
I'm bringing you home.

37:49.247 --> 37:52.650
- Are you okay?
- We gotta move.

38:05.931 --> 38:07.798
- What happened? Did it work?
- I don't know.

38:10.702 --> 38:11.969
Mom.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.073
Bullet's out.
Bleeding's under control.

38:17.943 --> 38:20.478
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

38:22.848 --> 38:24.782
His body's ready for him.

38:25.384 --> 38:27.685
Come on, Dad.
Come on.

38:33.725 --> 38:34.892
Is that...

38:35.761 --> 38:37.428
It's a heartbeat.

38:38.330 --> 38:39.797
It's faint,
but it's a heartbeat!

38:53.978 --> 38:55.713
You okay?

38:56.314 --> 38:59.815
I should be asking you the same question
after everything you've been through.

38:59.816 --> 39:01.218
I'm good.

39:01.987 --> 39:04.473
Just, um...
Hoping, you know?

39:06.892 --> 39:09.660
- Thank you.
- Had to be done.

39:10.762 --> 39:13.097
You're risking your life,
going against the Founder.

39:13.098 --> 39:14.947
You know that, right?

39:14.948 --> 39:16.488
So is everybody else here.

39:19.371 --> 39:21.605
They believe in you.

39:21.606 --> 39:23.073
And your dad.

39:25.310 --> 39:26.744
So do I.

39:35.387 --> 39:37.555
You can breathe again.

39:38.490 --> 39:40.057
Yeah, it looks like
he's out of the woods.

39:40.058 --> 39:42.584
It's only a matter of time
before he opens his eyes.

39:51.436 --> 39:53.679
I just can't get my head around it.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.572
Hmm.

39:54.573 --> 39:57.141
Well, get your head around this,
Roger's alive.

39:58.643 --> 40:00.177
You're absolved, kid.

40:00.912 --> 40:02.246
How does that make you feel?

40:06.284 --> 40:07.685
I don't know.

40:09.654 --> 40:10.855
I mean...

40:12.591 --> 40:14.658
If he opens his eyes and

40:15.594 --> 40:17.561
- walks out of here...
- You might forgive me?

40:20.632 --> 40:22.099
We'll see.

40:26.204 --> 40:27.571
How is he?

40:29.040 --> 40:31.742
Well, for a guy who's spent the
last six years in a block of ice

40:31.743 --> 40:33.711
with a bullet in his chest...

40:34.813 --> 40:36.781
I'd say he's doing pretty well.

40:41.219 --> 40:43.888
I just never dreamed
this day would come.

40:44.589 --> 40:46.323
I know.

40:46.324 --> 40:48.793
I told you he was coming back.

40:54.766 --> 40:57.301
You were right, his father's alive.

40:58.236 --> 40:59.537
Right on time.

41:01.039 --> 41:04.241
And you're sure Stephen has no
idea he's got a bit in his mouth?

41:04.242 --> 41:06.310
That he's been led exactly
where we want him?

41:07.245 --> 41:08.946
None.

41:09.347 --> 41:10.414
Well done.

41:10.815 --> 41:13.523
I'll let you know when it's
time for our next move.
