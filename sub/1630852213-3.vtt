WEBVTT

00:13.679 --> 00:14.679
MAN: So, in summary,

00:14.759 --> 00:16.039
- a vintage wedding.
- Mm-hmm.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.399
With some big
neon lights, yeah?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.559
- Yes.
- Full-on country?

00:19.640 --> 00:20.960
- Yes.
- All right, great.

00:21.039 --> 00:24.000
And at the end, dun-dun-dun,
the great performance

00:24.079 --> 00:25.920
- of DJ Luna.
- Looks great.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.679
He's the most sought after DJ
in Montseny.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.120
- Success guaranteed.
- Oh, really?

00:30.199 --> 00:33.200
Yes, people end up
jumping around and dancing.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.520
- An open-air dance.
- Yes.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.799
Sort of karaoke.
You choose, he plays it.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.799
[women chuckle]
So, let me crunch the numbers.

00:41.159 --> 00:42.759
Nine thousands euros.
Nice and round.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.840
- What do you think?
- Well, that would be great.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.640
- Right?
- Pretty busy schedule

00:46.719 --> 00:47.560
right now, you know.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.520
Don't know why,
but it seems like

00:49.600 --> 00:51.560
lately everyone's
getting engaged.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.359
[chuckles]

00:52.439 --> 00:56.280
It's like the song says,
"love is in the air."

00:56.359 --> 00:57.600
[laughter]

00:57.679 --> 00:59.560
Anyhow, I'm gonna
make the call.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.000
In the meantime,
think about it.

01:01.079 --> 01:02.520
- Sure thing.
- Okay?

01:02.600 --> 01:04.079
Thanks.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.840
He's pretty weird, huh?

01:05.920 --> 01:07.599
[chuckles]

01:09.239 --> 01:10.120
What's the matter?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.159
I mean, if you think
it's too much...

01:12.239 --> 01:14.079
- What?
- We can have a civil wedding,

01:14.159 --> 01:16.560
serve small bites
at Jaime's bar, that's it.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.400
Yeah, right.
What are you saying?

01:18.480 --> 01:19.920
I want a country style wedding.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I mean, who wouldn't
with DJ Luna

01:22.079 --> 01:23.159
and the whole effing thing.

01:23.239 --> 01:25.120
Then, I guess we need
to hire him now,

01:25.200 --> 01:29.120
'cause he might go to Japan.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.640
I could lick your tits
right here and now.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.480
- Playing hard to get?
- Potentially.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.959
Can you imagine actually living
in a big house like this?

01:55.040 --> 01:57.280
Waking up to all
these little bird sounds?

01:57.359 --> 01:59.319
- Oh, yeah.
- Nature all over.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.560
- [sighs]
- A river nearby.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.480
- Please stop.
- God, a river nearby.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.040
What if we bought a house?

02:05.680 --> 02:08.560
Yeah, two, and a palace
in Scotland.

02:08.639 --> 02:11.759
Okay, no,
but a small version.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.599
Huh?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.000
What?
We leave my place

02:14.080 --> 02:17.319
and apply for a mortgage
that lasts 30 years,

02:17.400 --> 02:19.240
and we definitely get it.

02:19.319 --> 02:21.360
That's a joke, right?

02:22.639 --> 02:24.360
I don't know.

02:24.439 --> 02:26.080
And what about
your commune of hippies?

02:26.159 --> 02:28.759
It doesn't make sense, does it,
to start a new project

02:28.840 --> 02:32.360
with you and my friends
simultaneously?

02:34.879 --> 02:35.840
Come on.

02:35.919 --> 02:38.919
We can have
a vegetable garden,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.479
and plant some tomatoes.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.560
And eggplants.
I love those.

02:46.639 --> 02:47.719
And eggplants.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.439
If you love them,
all the eggplants.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.560
[moaning]

02:52.639 --> 02:55.360
- You know what?
- What?

02:55.439 --> 02:58.840
I could eat your pussy
right now.

03:03.639 --> 03:06.560
[moaning]

03:06.639 --> 03:07.840
You need anything?

03:07.919 --> 03:09.319
[car horn honks]

03:09.400 --> 03:12.199
[women laughing]

03:13.120 --> 03:14.080
No, we're good.

03:14.159 --> 03:16.120
- Okay.
- Thanks. Bye.

03:16.199 --> 03:17.919
[both laughing]

03:18.000 --> 03:20.360
Fuck, what a pain in the ass.

03:20.439 --> 03:23.080
Oh, fuck,
he got us.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.479
[laughter]

03:37.520 --> 03:39.520
WOMAN: All right,
come on, time's up.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.919
Let's correct them, okay?

03:44.479 --> 03:46.159
All right, bye.

03:47.719 --> 03:48.759
Sorry.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.599
See ya.

03:52.280 --> 03:52.759
Uh, Gari?

03:52.840 --> 03:55.960
I wouldn't take
the test this Friday.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.560
But there's still
three days left.

03:57.639 --> 04:00.560
Yeah, but you're still getting
many of the answers wrong.

04:00.639 --> 04:04.080
Maybe you could--
you could take some tutoring.

04:04.159 --> 04:07.280
I'm not implying anything,
just lots of people do it.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.039
Look at Antonio--

04:08.120 --> 04:09.400
10 wrong answers,
two more than you.

04:09.479 --> 04:11.080
I mean, at least
you got an excuse.

04:11.159 --> 04:14.599
- You're an idiot.
- All right.

04:15.319 --> 04:16.759
Bye.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.560
Okay, so...

04:20.720 --> 04:21.959
Well, okay, uh...

04:22.040 --> 04:25.120
I won't take it on Friday,
but in two weeks, I will.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.480
- Okay.
- I don't wanna wait anymore.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.720
- Perfect.
- Okay.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.839
- Okay.
- Well, goodbye.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.639
- All right, bye.
- Have a good day.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.560
- See you later.

04:40.399 --> 04:42.279
What?

04:44.279 --> 04:46.720
[sighs]
Hi.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.560
[toy lightly rattling]

04:50.079 --> 04:53.399

04:57.759 --> 04:59.600
[sighs]

05:03.720 --> 05:04.920
[line ringing]

05:05.000 --> 05:06.199
- Xosé, how are you?
<i>- María?</i>

05:06.279 --> 05:08.000
<i>I can't talk right now,</i>
<i>I'm in a bind.</i>

05:08.079 --> 05:09.160
<i>A teacher left</i>
<i>us stranded</i>

05:09.240 --> 05:10.480
<i>and I have to fill in</i>
<i>for him.</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:12.560
<i>I'll stop by later,</i>
<i>but I gotta go now.</i>

05:12.639 --> 05:14.759
- Okay, okay.
<i>- All right, bye.</i>

05:14.839 --> 05:16.439
Bye.

05:23.879 --> 05:26.279

05:30.279 --> 05:32.319
[Gari sighs]

05:36.800 --> 05:39.680
Crossroads are the...

05:39.759 --> 05:40.600
[phone dings, buzzes]

05:40.680 --> 05:42.160
MARÍA:Hi, Gari,
I was calling to see

05:42.240 --> 05:43.680
<i>if you wanted to give</i>
<i>Juanito a bath.</i>

05:43.759 --> 05:45.680
<i>It's been days</i>
<i>since you last came by,</i>

05:45.759 --> 05:46.680
<i>and I know you're busy</i>

05:46.759 --> 05:48.160
<i>with the test,</i>
<i>but I don't know.</i>

05:48.240 --> 05:49.680
<i>My therapist said</i>
<i>it'd be good for us</i>

05:49.759 --> 05:52.000
<i>to take swimming classes</i>
<i>together with Juanito.</i>

05:52.079 --> 05:52.959
<i>So, please, let me know.</i>

05:53.040 --> 05:56.279
<i>I'd like for you</i>
<i>to come along, all right?</i>

05:57.360 --> 06:00.720
- [sighs]
- Aren't you gonna reply?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.959
- No.
- That's a shame.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.279
Going to the pool is awesome.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.959
Yeah, yeah, I'm...
I'm really bummed.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.279
But the test is in two weeks,
and it's not going well.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.040
But you can stop for an hour
to spend time with your kid.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.040
Imagine it, the two of you
swimming like this.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.639
Imagine it.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.759
Can't you imagine it?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.040
Yeah, but...
I'm not joking, you know.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.480
If I don't get my--
my driving's license,

06:26.560 --> 06:29.160
I can't be a good dad.
Do you understand that,

06:29.240 --> 06:30.240
- you know?
- I know.

06:30.319 --> 06:32.560
- I do understand.
- Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.920
I know you wanna go.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.959
I know it
because I know that look.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.560
- [laughing]
- I know it.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.160
Okay, fine.
Okay, I'm going.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.199
I'm going, but now,
will you let me study

06:43.279 --> 06:44.560
- for a little while?
- Yes.

06:44.639 --> 06:46.839
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.

07:05.839 --> 07:08.079
MARÍA:Hey, you know
you have a nephew, right?

07:08.160 --> 07:10.680
Uh, María, I'm up
to my eyeballs, dude.

07:10.759 --> 07:13.360
Well, anyway, that's not
why I'm calling you.

07:13.439 --> 07:14.800
You're on speaker.

07:14.879 --> 07:15.560
Hi, Xosé here.

07:15.639 --> 07:17.600
- Oh, hey.
- Listen, how would you like

07:17.680 --> 07:19.959
to come and give
painting lessons where I work?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.480
So, painting for
the handicapped?

07:21.560 --> 07:24.120
Dude.
We say neurodiversity

07:24.199 --> 07:25.600
or people who are neurodiverse--

07:25.680 --> 07:26.560
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.120
I'll say people
who are neurodiverse.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.240
It's just for three weeks
when the teacher's gonna be out.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.680
You can't tell me no
because of the store.

07:31.759 --> 07:33.920
- You don't work Fridays.
- I'm not sure about it, María.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.399
Besides, you know
I've given up painting now.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.199
MARÍA:<i>It's teaching to paint.</i>
XOSÉ:Right.

07:37.279 --> 07:39.639
MARÍA:<i>It's just three</i>
<i>Fridays.</i> - Yeah, no.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.399
[laughing]
How's María?

07:41.480 --> 07:42.560
- Fine, she's fine.
- Yeah?

07:42.639 --> 07:44.079
Esther, will you come
and see us dance?

07:44.160 --> 07:46.600
- Excuse me, it's a performance.
- Performance, huh?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.399
- Yes.
- No, it's not like that at all.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.439
Don't exaggerate like that.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.279
- It's not a performance.
- I think it is, it's outside.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.279
No, the teacher said
we could have an outdoor lesson

07:53.360 --> 07:56.079
- in the Parc de la Ciutadella.
- That's cool, right?

07:56.160 --> 07:57.560
- There's about 40 of us.
- Forty, yeah, you know.

07:57.639 --> 07:58.839
I mean, that's a lot,
you'll see.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.199
There'll be three
other groups there.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.839
- Yeah, and when is it?
- At 7:00.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.959
- On Friday.
- At 7:00.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.120
- Mm-hmm.
- Shit, you know what?

08:05.199 --> 08:06.920
- What?
- I just agreed

08:07.000 --> 08:09.160
to teach a painting class
on Friday for people

08:09.240 --> 08:10.480
- who are neurodiverse.
- Really?

08:10.560 --> 08:11.920
- Oh, that's great.
- That's wonderful.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.680
Mm-hmm, that's why
my sister called me, babe.

08:13.759 --> 08:14.920
- Hey, that's great.
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.120
Social conscience
is important.

08:16.199 --> 08:17.600
- That's amazing.
- Of course, honey, I got you.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.079
Well, part of it is that
my nephew's father

08:20.160 --> 08:22.240
has a disability,
so that made me aware of it.

08:22.319 --> 08:26.279
It's really made me connect
with altruism, doing good.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.680
I mean, I'm really affected

08:28.759 --> 08:29.680
- by it now.
- I know.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.079
That's great.
Hear, hear.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.759
[overlapping chatter]
To sensitivity.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.679
May it always
be there for us.

08:44.279 --> 08:46.080
Morning.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.200
Morning.

08:50.159 --> 08:53.159
Mind if I take advantage of you?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.559
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

08:55.639 --> 08:57.240
Will you watch
Juanito for a sec

08:57.320 --> 08:59.320
while I take a shower?

09:00.080 --> 09:01.679
Not what I expected you to say.

09:01.759 --> 09:04.279
Mm.
No, thanks.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.279
And if he cries?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.200
With you,
he never cries.

09:07.279 --> 09:09.440
[sighs]

09:09.519 --> 09:10.159
[door opens]

09:10.240 --> 09:12.759
Don't worry,
I won't be long.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.279
[Juanito babbling]

[water running]

09:22.720 --> 09:23.759

09:23.840 --> 09:26.679
XOSÉ: Hey, it's already
pretty late.

09:26.759 --> 09:29.519
MARÍA: Sure you don't wanna stay
for breakfast?

09:29.600 --> 09:30.960
I don't have time.

09:31.039 --> 09:32.960
I have to meet with students.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.240
And I wanna talk
to Gari.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.039
- Why?
- I'm gonna tell him

09:36.120 --> 09:37.360
we're seeing each other.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.360
- Oh.
- Okay?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.000
- Yeah.
- I don't want him

09:40.080 --> 09:41.360
to imagine things.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.960
What things
would he imagine?

09:43.039 --> 09:43.799
Well, he's really touchy

09:43.879 --> 09:46.720
about the driver's license
and he obsesses.

09:46.799 --> 09:47.759
Right.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.120
Well, I'm sure
it'll be okay.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.600

20:33.559 --> 20:37.799
And it's also
important that she knows.

20:38.839 --> 20:40.680
You need to talk to her.

20:40.759 --> 20:43.559
She needs to know
what you want.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.680
You're exactly right.
I'll talk to her.

20:47.759 --> 20:49.599
I'll tell her.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.000
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:59.279 --> 20:59.920
Wait, wait.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.519
- I have to watch the rice.
- What?

21:01.599 --> 21:04.599
Yeah, I'm cooking you
a delicious meal today.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.559
- Are you?
- Uh-huh.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.160
I am preparing a selection
of typical Indonesian dishes.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.039
I'm making cap cai,
nasi campur,

21:12.119 --> 21:12.759
and gado-gado.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.000
I think we could have
something else, right?

21:15.079 --> 21:17.799
Save that for dessert.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.160
By the way,
I made you kolak,

21:19.240 --> 21:22.960
which is banana
with coconut milk.

21:23.039 --> 21:28.200
Today, I want you to have
all sorts of orgasms.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.079
Mary, I won't make it
for dinner, okay, hon?

21:32.160 --> 21:35.799
So, I'll talk to you later.
Love you so much.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.799
[sighs]

21:38.880 --> 21:41.079
[phone dings, buzzes]

21:41.640 --> 21:43.000
MARÍA:I knew it!
You told me

21:43.079 --> 21:46.680
<i>you'd just get there,</i>
<i>fuck him, and leave!</i>

21:49.319 --> 21:52.480
Then we went into a café,
there was a sign,

21:52.559 --> 21:53.480
"pulled pork from Léon."

21:53.559 --> 21:55.119
- Okay.
- I look at my buddy

21:55.200 --> 21:57.640
and say, "But who is actually
gonna eat this?"

21:57.720 --> 22:00.200
I mean, who's gonna have
to drag the pig?

22:00.279 --> 22:02.920
- No. No!
- That was the day I found out

22:03.000 --> 22:05.640
"pulled pork" doesn't mean
dragging a pig.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.680
So, you were taught
by priests, or what?

22:08.759 --> 22:09.480
Yes.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.200
And they taught you
how to make a girl squirt?

22:12.279 --> 22:12.799
No, no.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.240
That, I learned
in the school of life.

22:15.319 --> 22:18.440
- Ah, the school of life.
- Yeah.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.480
[sighs]

22:27.559 --> 22:30.640
- Are you cold?
- A bit, yeah.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.440
I'll get you a blanket
and bring dessert.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.119
[phone dings, buzzes]

22:46.920 --> 22:48.759
[sighs]

22:57.920 --> 22:58.599
Here you go.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.519
Hey, I'm gonna
head out, okay?

23:00.599 --> 23:02.400
One of the kids
has a fever.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.680
I'll feel bad if I stay.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.240
Okay.
Want me to come?

23:06.319 --> 23:08.000
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?

23:08.079 --> 23:08.559
Yeah.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.200
Okay, well,
we'll be in touch.

23:11.279 --> 23:12.920
Mm-hmm.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.440
[chuckles]

23:26.720 --> 23:29.160
What are you doing
in bed already?

23:29.240 --> 23:30.599
I really did my back in.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.400
It-- it hurts a lot,
and so I took two, um...

23:34.480 --> 23:35.160
two diazepam.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.599
- You what?
- Doing line dancing and...

23:38.680 --> 23:41.559
I left you
an eggplant pie

23:41.640 --> 23:42.839
in the-- in the oven.

23:42.920 --> 23:47.200
And a surprise
for your painting class.

23:47.279 --> 23:48.559
But you said
your back is hurt.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.359
Do you want me to give you
like a massage

23:50.440 --> 23:53.319
- or something, or...
- [mumbling]

23:53.400 --> 23:54.640
Julia?

23:54.720 --> 23:56.000
And, you know...

23:56.079 --> 23:57.559
[snapping]

23:57.640 --> 23:59.440
Hey.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.200
[sighs]

24:11.400 --> 24:14.480
[phone chiming, buzzing]

24:24.079 --> 24:25.240
[line ringing]

24:25.319 --> 24:27.640
XOSÉ:Gari, it was
a misunderstanding.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.119
<i>We were gonna tell you.</i>

24:29.200 --> 24:31.319
Oh, come on, Gari,
we're buddies.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.000
Quit saying that.
We're not buddies!

24:33.079 --> 24:36.519
We're not friends, you're--
you're just my counselor.

24:36.599 --> 24:40.119
I'm the disabled person
you're counseling, okay?

24:40.200 --> 24:41.599
- Gari...
<i>- I don't wanna talk</i>

24:41.680 --> 24:44.200
to you anymore,
because I'm drunk.

24:44.279 --> 24:46.359
Goodbye.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.519
Fuck.

24:56.599 --> 24:59.440
[music]

25:35.279 --> 25:36.359
[sighs]

25:36.440 --> 25:38.799
Come on, drink.
Want it?

25:38.880 --> 25:40.960
Just a little.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.720
[sighs]

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
[door opens and closes]

26:22.359 --> 26:24.079
Hi, hon.

26:26.519 --> 26:27.799
How's María?

26:27.880 --> 26:28.480
A mess.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.920
I fixed dinner
and put her to bed.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.440
- And you guys?
- Good.

26:32.519 --> 26:35.759
They decided to play
with each toy for five minutes

26:35.839 --> 26:36.920
so they wouldn't be sad.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.400
Sad?
Who, the kids?

26:38.480 --> 26:40.200
- No, the toys.
- Oh.

26:40.279 --> 26:41.799
We'll tidy up tomorrow, okay?

26:41.880 --> 26:42.559
No, I don't mind.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.519
It'll help me
clear my head.

26:44.599 --> 26:46.839
María was super intense.

26:51.559 --> 26:53.079
Hey.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.400
Yeah?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.799
I want to end
our agreement.

26:59.759 --> 27:00.559
Paula's growing up,

27:00.640 --> 27:02.400
and it's very hard
to hide it from her

27:02.480 --> 27:03.319
so it doesn't affect her.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.440
She asked me
if we had more partners.

27:05.519 --> 27:08.920
- She asked you that as well?
- Yeah.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.200
So, this is about Paula.

27:12.279 --> 27:17.160
No, Cris.
About us as well.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.119
All day long
I'm picturing things.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.000
It's really getting to me.

27:21.079 --> 27:22.599
How about you?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.759
I don't want this
to end up hurting us,

27:24.839 --> 27:25.599
and I'm suffering.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.319
No, I don't want you
suffering.

27:29.839 --> 27:33.200
Should we be
a normal couple again

27:33.279 --> 27:35.119
and cancel the contract?

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
Lawyer?

27:40.440 --> 27:42.279
Okay.
[sniffling]

27:42.359 --> 27:45.559
Yes.
[sighs]

27:54.440 --> 27:56.000
Yes?

27:57.240 --> 27:59.359
I love you.

28:01.319 --> 28:02.519
[baby crying]

28:02.599 --> 28:06.200
No, I'll go.
It's my turn today.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.359
You okay?

28:13.160 --> 28:14.759
[phone dings, buzzes]

28:14.839 --> 28:17.000
[sighs, sniffles]

28:17.079 --> 28:19.960
[baby continues crying]

28:32.640 --> 28:35.480
[music]
