WEBVTT

00:01.171 --> 00:02.583
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.718
I GOT A CALL
ON THE WAY BACK FROM VEGAS.

00:07.718 --> 00:09.179
WELL, YOUR WAY
BACK FROM VEGAS,

00:09.179 --> 00:10.511
YOU AND HUBBELL.
ANYHOW,

00:10.511 --> 00:11.802
HE CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME TO PUT

00:11.802 --> 00:14.054
EVERYTHING IN HER NAME,
YOUR NAME‐‐

00:14.054 --> 00:15.806
THE WILL, THE LAND,
THE HOUSE.

00:15.806 --> 00:18.138
HE HAD ME ADD HER
TO HIS CAR INSURANCE

00:18.138 --> 00:19.229
<i>AND CREDIT CARD.</i>

00:19.229 --> 00:20.731
<i>I SENT IN A CHANGE
OF ADDRESS FORM</i>

00:20.731 --> 00:22.352
<i>AND REREGISTERED
HER TO VOTE.</i>

00:22.352 --> 00:24.274
AND SIGNED HER UP
FOR A SUBSCRIPTION
TO "ROLLING STONE."

00:24.274 --> 00:25.606
STARTS NEXT MONTH.

00:25.606 --> 00:27.528
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.699
IT CAN'T START
THIS MONTH,

00:28.699 --> 00:30.030
BECAUSE WE'RE
ALREADY HALF WAY IN.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.743
I UNDERSTAND HOW
A MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION WORKS.

00:32.743 --> 00:34.535
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW MY SON

00:34.535 --> 00:36.366
COULD GIVE AWAY
MY HOME.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.367
HE DID NOT
GIVE IT AWAY,

00:37.367 --> 00:38.709
HE JUST PUT IT
IN HER NAME.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.041
MY HOUSE,
MY LAND,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.833
MY STUDIO,
IN HER NAME?

00:42.833 --> 00:44.925
‐ YES.
‐ I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:44.925 --> 00:46.296
‐ HELP?
‐ JERRY,

00:46.296 --> 00:48.719
I THINK WHAT FANNY
IS TRYING TO SAY IS...

00:49.880 --> 00:51.381
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

00:51.381 --> 00:53.053
‐ OH, BOY.
‐ AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.225
ACTUALLY, THERE'S A GENERAL
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING

00:55.225 --> 00:56.266
ON THIS SIDE
OF THE TABLE.

00:57.768 --> 00:59.309
I GOT A CALL
ON THE WAY BACK FROM VEGAS‐‐

00:59.309 --> 01:00.641
HUBBELL AND I
WERE MARRIED

01:00.641 --> 01:02.983
FOR TWO DAYS.
THAT'S IT.

01:02.983 --> 01:04.815
LESS IF YOU COUNT
THE TIME I WAS CONSCIOUS,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.527
WHICH WAS BASICALLY
FROM VALET PARKING

01:06.527 --> 01:08.398
TO THE NICKEL SLOTS BATHROOM
AT WHISKEY PETE'S.

01:08.398 --> 01:10.611
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING
ABOUT 16 HOURS, TOPS.

01:10.611 --> 01:13.113
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CONTINUE THIS TOMORROW.
I MEAN, YOU'RE UPSET.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.576
‐ I'M EXPLAINING THIS BADLY.
‐ DOES SHE OWN EVERYTHING?

01:17.117 --> 01:20.080
‐ YES.
‐ YOU'RE EXPLAINING IT
JUST FINE.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.082
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO ME?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.044
‐ YOU WERE HIS WIFE.
‐ FOR SECONDS.

01:24.044 --> 01:26.336
BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND ALL HUBBELL
EVER WANTED IN LIFE

01:26.336 --> 01:29.760
WAS TO BE MARRIED.
HE'S TALKED ABOUT IT
SINCE THE FOURTH GRADE.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.712
HE DRESSED UP
AS A GROOM FOR HALLOWEEN

01:31.712 --> 01:33.764
EVER YEAR
SIX YEARS IN A ROW.

01:33.764 --> 01:35.846
PEOPLE KEPT THINKING
HE WAS A WAITER UNTIL
HE FINALLY CONVINCED

01:35.846 --> 01:37.477
THAT WEIRD, OLD SHUT‐IN LADY
DOWN THE STREET

01:37.477 --> 01:38.809
TO GO WITH HIM
AS HIS BRIDE.

01:38.809 --> 01:40.851
‐ SISSY MERKOWSKI.
‐ SISSY MERKOWSKI.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.563
SHE STILL
LIVES THERE.

01:42.563 --> 01:44.775
THAT HALLOWEEN
WAS THE LAST TIME
ANYONE SAW HER.

01:44.775 --> 01:47.067
WHEN IT FINALLY HAPPENED,
HE JUST WANTED

01:47.067 --> 01:48.899
TO LET EVERYONE KNOW.

01:48.899 --> 01:51.692
HE WAS SO HAPPY,
I NEVER HEARD HIM
SO HAPPY.

01:51.692 --> 01:53.493
SO.

01:53.493 --> 01:56.496
HE GOT HIS BRIDE,
YOU GET THE HOUSE

01:56.496 --> 01:58.659
AND MY SON HAS THROWN ME
OUT ON THE STREET.

01:58.659 --> 02:01.792
‐ NO. NOT TRUE.
‐ I'LL HAVE TO MOVE IN
WITH SISSY MERKOWSKI

02:01.792 --> 02:03.373
AND THE MUMMIFIED
CORPSE OF HER MOTHER

02:03.373 --> 02:05.245
WHICH I THINK SHE KEEPS
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

02:05.245 --> 02:06.797
Jerry:
<i>FANNY, YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY.</i>

02:06.797 --> 02:08.298
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
TAKEN CARE OF.

02:08.298 --> 02:10.050
THERE ARE PROVISIONS
IN THERE.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.133
THE DANCE STUDIO IS
YOURS TO RUN AS LONG
AS YOU WANT IT,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.516
AND I'M SURE MICHELLE
HAS NO INTENTION

02:15.516 --> 02:17.968
‐ OF MOVING YOU
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.
‐ NO INTENTION AT ALL.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.600
SEE? SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.061
EXCEPT NOW EVERYTHING'S
IN MICHELLE'S NAME

02:21.061 --> 02:23.974
INSTEAD OF HUBBELL'S.
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

02:23.974 --> 02:25.766
<i>YOU DIDN'T OWN
ANYTHING BEFORE,</i>

02:25.766 --> 02:28.979
SO NOW YOU‐‐
YOU STILL DON'T
OWN ANYTHING.

02:28.979 --> 02:30.270
( mouths )

02:30.270 --> 02:32.192
YEAH, LOOK.

02:32.192 --> 02:35.075
IT'S AN AWFUL TIME,
AND, UM...

02:35.075 --> 02:37.237
I'M SURE YOU BOTH MUST
HAVE A MILLION QUESTIONS.

02:37.237 --> 02:40.160
<i>SO WHY DON'T YOU STOP
BY MY OFFICE NEXT WEEK</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:41.912
AND, UM, I'LL
GO OVER IT AGAIN.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.453
<i>OKAY?</i>

02:43.453 --> 02:46.456
<i>( cuckoo clocks chiming )</i>

03:18.278 --> 03:21.451
<i>( door opens, shuts )</i>

03:28.669 --> 03:32.382
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:50.691 --> 03:54.274
‐ <i>( clocks chiming )
</i> ‐ OH MY GOD!

03:54.274 --> 03:56.276
‐ <i>( clock barking )
</i> ‐ ( groans )

04:05.165 --> 04:07.167
<i>( barking continues )</i>

04:14.585 --> 04:16.006
GOOD DOG.

04:24.434 --> 04:25.846
UGH.

04:33.654 --> 04:36.026
OH, PRE‐WAR. NICE.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.207
ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE
OF YOU FREAKS HAS FOOD?

04:49.870 --> 04:51.411
AND I'M WAITING
FOR AN ANSWER.

04:51.411 --> 04:52.412
NEW LOW.

04:57.467 --> 05:00.340
FOOD, FOOD.
NEAREST FOOD.

05:01.682 --> 05:03.093
OKAY, I'M SORRY, KID,
BUT A SPLIT TOENAIL

05:03.093 --> 05:04.094
IS NOT GONNA CUT IT.

05:04.094 --> 05:05.686
IF IT WERE INFECTED,
THEN WE COULD TALK.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.638
BUT IT'S TURNING
BLACK AND BLUE. SEE?

05:07.638 --> 05:09.229
SERIOUSLY? YOU CALL THAT
BLACK AND BLUE?

05:09.229 --> 05:10.811
PSH. CALL ME WHEN
YOU GET SOME GLASSES.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.982
OFF THE TREE.

05:11.982 --> 05:13.774
‐ WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME?
‐ BUNIONS.

05:13.774 --> 05:15.145
‐ THERE, THERE...
‐ ( camera clicks )

05:15.145 --> 05:16.647
‐ ...AND THERE.
‐ NICE.

05:16.647 --> 05:18.358
OH, YEAH.
WE DO BUNIONS GOOD.

05:18.358 --> 05:20.781
IT'S A FAMILY THING.
MY MOM HAS BUNIONS

05:20.781 --> 05:23.153
AND SHE TALKS A LOT
ABOUT BUNIONS.

05:23.153 --> 05:24.494
AND MENOPAUSE.

05:24.494 --> 05:25.786
SHE REALLY NEEDS
TO GO ON A DATE.

05:25.786 --> 05:27.157
FOOT HIGHER,
PLEASE?

05:27.157 --> 05:28.789
( camera clicks )

05:28.789 --> 05:30.370
OH, BEAUTY.
REALLY.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.792
OKAY, BOO?

05:31.792 --> 05:34.164
FIVE BLISTERS,
AN INGROWN TOENAIL

05:34.164 --> 05:36.166
AND SOME GENERAL SCABBING

05:36.166 --> 05:38.509
‐ AND PEELING.
‐ I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

05:38.509 --> 05:41.011
HEY, NICE PICTURES?

05:41.011 --> 05:42.052
IS THIS A NEW
INTERNET THING

05:42.052 --> 05:43.463
I'M HAPPY TO BE
TOO OLD TO KNOW ABOUT?

05:43.463 --> 05:45.095
WE'RE TAKING
PICTURES OF OUR FEET.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.097
YEAH, I GOT THE WHAT,
JUST LOOKING FOR THE WHY.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.388
WE'RE HAVING
A CONTEST

05:48.388 --> 05:50.390
TO SEE WHOSE ARE
THE MOST DISGUSTING.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.142
‐ AAH.
‐ WE'RE COMPETING
WITH SCHOOLS

05:52.142 --> 05:54.525
ALL OVER CALIFORNIA,
'CAUSE THE GROSSER
THE FEET‐‐

05:54.525 --> 05:56.937
THE BETTER
THE DANCE STUDIO.
I'M WITH YOU.

05:56.937 --> 05:58.478
SAN FRANCISCO LOOKS
PRETTY COMPETITIVE.

05:58.478 --> 06:00.821
AH, LA CANADA IS
REALLY THE ONE TO BEAT.

06:00.821 --> 06:02.282
UGH, THOSE GIRLS
HAVE REVOLTING FEET.

06:02.282 --> 06:04.404
‐ PLUS THEY HAVE A RINGER.
‐ A RINGER?

06:04.404 --> 06:06.867
YEAH, ONE OF THE GIRLS
HAS A SHRUNKEN TOE.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.079
‐ A WHAT?
‐ Ginny: <i>ALL HER TOES
ARE NORMAL SIZED,</i>

06:09.079 --> 06:10.541
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
NEXT TO THE PINKY TOE.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.953
IT'S... THIS BIG.
WHICH WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH,

06:12.953 --> 06:14.665
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.047
‐ WHERE IS IT?
‐ Ginny: <i>IN THE MIDDLE
OF HER FOOT.</i>

06:17.047 --> 06:19.089
WHICH SHOULDN'T EVEN COUNT
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT BALLET,

06:19.089 --> 06:22.092
THAT'S D.N.A.
THAT'S COUSIN‐MAKING‐
BABIES TERRITORY.

06:22.092 --> 06:23.764
BUT IT'S SUPER GROSS,
SO THEY ALWAYS WIN.

06:23.764 --> 06:25.636
WE'VE COME
IN THIRD FOUR TIMES

06:25.636 --> 06:28.388
AND SECOND TWICE,
BUT WE'VE NEVER WON.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.680
HOW ARE YOUR FEET?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.061
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON POINT.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.222
‐ SORRY.
‐ OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

06:32.222 --> 06:33.564
PROFESSIONAL GROSS FOOT
WOULD REALLY PUT US

06:33.564 --> 06:35.225
OVER THE TOP.
HEY, BOO.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.187
THAT BLISTER WOULD BE
A LOT MORE DISGUSTING
IF IT POPPED.

06:37.187 --> 06:38.318
OH, RIGHT.

06:38.318 --> 06:39.900
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GOOD LUCK. GAH.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.112
OKAY. YEAH.
TEXT ME WITH THE WINNER.

06:42.112 --> 06:44.194
OKAY, WE WILL.

06:44.194 --> 06:46.286
‐ YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU MY NUMBER?
‐ OH, WE HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

06:46.286 --> 06:48.238
‐ YOU DO?
‐ EVERYBODY HAS
YOUR NUMBER.

06:48.238 --> 06:49.409
‐ REALLY?
‐ YEP.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.532
THORNTON WILDER
SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED

06:51.532 --> 06:53.083
THE CREEPY SIDE
OF SMALL TOWN LIFE.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.415
‐ WHO?
‐ NO ONE.
HE WAS IN MENUDO.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.247
‐ WHO?
‐ I'M GONNA GO
BE OLD NOW.

06:57.247 --> 06:58.248
OKAY, BYE.

06:58.248 --> 07:00.000
MY BIG TOENAIL
JUST CAME OFF!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.421
MY BIG TOENAIL
JUST CAME OFF.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.174
YES! SUCK IT,
LA CANADA.

07:06.346 --> 07:07.638
SO.

07:09.009 --> 07:10.470
WHO KNEW
THE GAS STATION

07:10.470 --> 07:12.763
ALSO HAS A FINE
BAKERY SECTION.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.145
WELL, IT DOES.
SO I GOT US SOME BREAKFAST,

07:15.145 --> 07:16.356
AND NOW I'M GONNA
MAKE US SOME COFFEE

07:16.356 --> 07:17.688
THAT ISN'T COMPLETELY
SEE THROUGH.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.479
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T EAT BREAKFAST.

07:19.479 --> 07:22.903
HOLD THAT DECISION UNTIL
YOU SEE WHAT I BOUGHT.

07:22.903 --> 07:24.905
SCONES. HUH?

07:24.905 --> 07:26.066
FEELING THE "DOWNTOWN ABBEY"?

07:26.066 --> 07:27.908
NOW HERE'S THE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

07:27.908 --> 07:29.620
ABOUT SCONES‐‐ ARE THEY
SUPPOSED TO BE HARD?

07:29.620 --> 07:30.831
I MEAN, LIKE,
THIS HARD?

07:30.831 --> 07:32.032
BECAUSE THIS ONE'S
LIKE A ROCK

07:32.032 --> 07:33.834
WITH WEIRD TEENY‐TINY
RAISINS IN IT.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.415
‐ CURRANTS.
‐ EXCUSE ME?

07:35.415 --> 07:37.788
THE SMALL RAISINS
ARE CALLED CURRANTS.

07:39.339 --> 07:40.791
OH, YOU'RE
A TEA PERSON.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.883
THAT EXPLAINS
THE EXTENSIVE SCONE KNOWLEDGE.

07:42.883 --> 07:44.925
I'M SORRY?

07:44.925 --> 07:46.386
OH, THE KETTLE.

07:46.386 --> 07:48.509
YES.
I'LL EXPLAIN.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.641
THIS TEA KETTLE ACTUALLY
CAME WITH THE HOUSE.

07:50.641 --> 07:52.182
IT WAS UNDER THE SINK
WHEN WE MOVED IN.

07:52.182 --> 07:53.594
SO IT BELONGED
TO THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVED HERE

07:53.594 --> 07:54.805
BEFORE WE DID,
SO I FIGURED

07:54.805 --> 07:56.146
IT WAS LEGAL
TO USE.

07:56.146 --> 07:58.148
‐ LEGAL?
‐ NOW THAT ONE.

07:58.148 --> 07:59.650
THE SHINY,
NEW, CLEAN ONE,

07:59.650 --> 08:01.151
OF COURSE IS YOURS NOW.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.483
‐ OH, BOY.
‐ <i>THIS ONE IS
A BIT RUSTY,</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:04.945
AND THERE DO SEEM
TO BE SOME HOLES

08:04.945 --> 08:06.196
AROUND THE SIDE HERE.

08:06.196 --> 08:07.988
BUT I FIGURE IF I DON'T
FILL IT TOO FULL

08:07.988 --> 08:10.611
AND I STOP IT BEFORE
IT COMPLETELY BOILS,

08:10.611 --> 08:12.533
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ALMOST HAVE ENOUGH

08:12.533 --> 08:14.665
‐ FOR A SINGLE CUP OF TEA.
‐ PLEASE STOP.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.077
NOW, WATER‐‐

08:17.077 --> 08:18.749
WATER COULD BE
A PROBLEM.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.621
BECAUSE THE PIPES
ARE YOURS,

08:20.621 --> 08:21.752
THE SINK IS YOURS

08:21.752 --> 08:23.674
AND THE FAUCET
IS YOURS.

08:23.674 --> 08:26.006
I GUESS I COULD TAP
INTO THE COUNTY WELL WATER,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.218
OR MAYBE TAKE A BUCKET
OUT TO THE AQUEDUCT,

08:28.218 --> 08:29.550
OR THERE'S POND WATER,

08:29.550 --> 08:31.301
OR THAT POTHOLE

08:31.301 --> 08:32.973
ON HIGHWAY THREE
SHOULD STILL HAVE

08:32.973 --> 08:34.845
SOME RAINWATER IN IT
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

08:34.845 --> 08:35.976
MAYBE I COULD
BUILD A FIRE

08:35.976 --> 08:37.347
AND BOIL
THE INSECTS OUT.

08:37.347 --> 08:38.769
I SHOULD SIT, RIGHT?

08:38.769 --> 08:43.023
NOW, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS
NEVER OWNED ANYTHING,

08:43.023 --> 08:44.695
I SHOULD HAVE HAD
A PLAN FOR THIS.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.026
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.107
I SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT IT THROUGH.

08:47.107 --> 08:48.859
‐ I APOLOGIZE.
‐ GOOD.

08:48.859 --> 08:50.651
I WILL FIGURE
ALL THIS OUT VERY SOON.

08:50.651 --> 08:51.992
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

08:51.992 --> 08:53.574
I WOULD REALLY LIKE

08:53.574 --> 08:55.656
A PARTIAL CUP
OF RUSTY TEA.

08:55.656 --> 08:58.328
SO HOW ABOUT,
JUST FOR TODAY,

08:58.328 --> 08:59.790
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE WATER

08:59.790 --> 09:02.252
‐ I GIVE YOU A DIME?
‐ NO.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.716
ALL RIGHT,
A QUARTER.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.337
<i>NOW.</i>

09:07.337 --> 09:09.469
A MUG, A MUG, A MUG.

09:09.469 --> 09:10.761
FANNY PLEASE
JUST TAKE A MUG.

09:10.761 --> 09:13.223
HUBBELL MADE
THIS FOR ME

09:13.223 --> 09:14.885
WHEN HE WAS SIX.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.386
OF COURSE IT'S TOXIC

09:16.386 --> 09:19.269
AND CONTAINS LEAD PAINT,
BUT IT WAS A GIFT.

09:19.269 --> 09:20.811
AND HERE'S WHERE
I'M CONFUSED‐‐

09:20.811 --> 09:22.733
ARE GIFTS YOURS, TOO?

09:22.733 --> 09:25.065
SHOULD WE CALL
THE LAWYER BEFORE
I POUR MY TEA?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.987
FANNY, CAN WE PLEASE
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?

09:26.987 --> 09:29.279
‐ TALK ABOUT WHAT?
THE FACT IT I'M HOMELESS?
‐ YOU'RE NOT HOMELESS.

09:29.279 --> 09:31.572
‐ TALK ABOUT
THE FACT THAT I'M JOBLESS?
‐ YOU'RE NOT JOBLESS!

09:31.572 --> 09:33.283
AS OF TODAY, YOU OWN
THE BALLET SCHOOL.

09:33.283 --> 09:35.495
NO, YOU OWN THE SCHOOL.
I JUST OWN THE BUILDING

09:35.495 --> 09:37.077
AND THE LAND THE SCHOOL
IS SITTING ON.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.700
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.372
IT'S TRUE.
WHY NOT SAY IT?

09:42.372 --> 09:45.255
MY SON HAS THROWN ME
OUT INTO THE COLD.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.918
HE MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE PUT ME ON AN ICEBERG
AND PUSHED ME OUT TO SEA.

09:47.918 --> 09:50.260
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE MILES FROM
THE NEAREST ICEBERG.

09:51.261 --> 09:53.383
HOW COCKY BEING
LAND RICH HAS MADE YOU.

09:53.383 --> 09:56.266
FANNY, HUBBELL LOVE YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.388
I MEAN, THE MAN LIVED
WITH YOU FOR 48 YEARS.

09:58.388 --> 10:00.811
THAT'S LOVE.
IT'S BORDERLINE PSYCHOTIC,
BUT IT'S LOVE.

10:00.811 --> 10:02.312
THINK ABOUT IT,
FANNY.

10:02.312 --> 10:03.934
PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT
TO PASS AWAY

10:03.934 --> 10:05.646
BEFORE THEIR PARENTS.
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.318
HUBBELL OBVIOUSLY ASSUMED,
BY THE TIME HE‐‐

10:08.318 --> 10:10.531
YOU KNOW,
THAT YOU WOULD
ALREADY BE...

10:10.531 --> 10:11.942
DEAD?

10:11.942 --> 10:13.734
NO.

10:13.734 --> 10:16.196
I MEAN, WELL...
YOU ARE‐‐

10:16.196 --> 10:18.789
‐ OLD?
‐ NO! I MEAN‐‐

10:18.789 --> 10:20.951
WELL, YEAH,
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.743
THIS WAS NOT
MY IDEA!

10:22.743 --> 10:24.545
I NEVER WANTED
ALL OF <i>THIS.</i>

10:24.545 --> 10:26.707
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU EXISTED
WHEN I GOT MARRIED.

10:26.707 --> 10:28.879
WELL, THAT'S NICE.
I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.751
OH, YOU'RE SO EXHAUSTING.

10:30.751 --> 10:33.213
WE OLD PEOPLE
USUALLY ARE.

10:33.213 --> 10:35.175
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TEA.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.137
TAKE THE MUG.
TAKE THE POT.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.468
I HAVE A CLASS
TO TEACH.

10:46.226 --> 10:46.897
<i>( students chattering )</i>

10:46.897 --> 10:49.189
‐ HI.
‐ JEEZ.

10:49.189 --> 10:51.401
DON'T EVER SNEAK UP
ON SOMEONE READING THE WORDS

10:51.401 --> 10:52.943
"AMIDST A BLOODY
AFTERMATH."

10:52.943 --> 10:53.944
OH, SORRY.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.155
PICK A HAND.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.537
THAT ONE.

10:56.537 --> 10:58.198
‐ FOR YOU.
‐ A SNOOD.

10:58.198 --> 10:59.369
SO COOL.

10:59.369 --> 11:00.871
I MADE IT FOR THE
JOFFREY AUDITIONS.

11:00.871 --> 11:02.082
IT'S LUCKY.

11:02.082 --> 11:04.164
OOH. A LUCKY SNOOD.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.836
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO DANCE NOW.

11:07.548 --> 11:09.089
IT'S PERFECT.
I LOVE IT.

11:09.089 --> 11:10.460
‐ PUT IT ON?
‐ YEP.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.641
‐ YOU GUYS CAN SIT THERE.
‐ Boy: SO HOW LONG
IS THIS THING?

11:20.641 --> 11:22.513
MY CLASS IS
AN HOUR AND A HALF.

11:22.513 --> 11:23.974
‐ SERIOUSLY?
‐ OH MY GOD.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.726
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU DRIVEN ME
TO BALLET CLASS?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.107
Boy:
<i>I KNOW, BUT IT
USED TO BE SHORTER.</i>

11:27.107 --> 11:29.229
‐ IT WAS NEVER SHORTER.
‐ YOU SAID IT WAS SHORTER.

11:29.229 --> 11:30.811
LAST MONTH IT WAS
TOTALLY SHORTER.

11:30.811 --> 11:32.072
NEVER IN THE HISTORY
OF EXISTING

11:32.072 --> 11:33.734
HAS IT EVER BEEN SHORTER
THAN IT IS NOW.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.737
‐ WE'RE MEETING BUD
AND MELON AT 6:00.
‐ MY CLASS IS TILL 6:30.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.779
‐ Boy #2: <i>NOT GONNA WORK.
</i> ‐ Boy: <i>WE'RE MEETING THEM
AT 6:00.</i>

11:38.779 --> 11:41.782
‐ THAT'S A LOT OF MIRRORS.
‐ IT'S A BALLET STUDIO, GENIUS.

11:41.782 --> 11:43.954
‐ JUST DUCK OUT EARLY.
‐ YEAH, BEFORE THE SWAN DIES.

11:45.085 --> 11:46.667
WHAT? I'M NOT
A BARBARIAN.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.089
‐ I'M NOT DUCKING OUT EARLY.
‐ THEN BAIL NOW.

11:49.089 --> 11:50.090
NO.

11:50.090 --> 11:51.792
DUDE, HANDLE THIS.
SHE'S EIGHT.

11:51.792 --> 11:55.095
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAD TO HAVE YOUR
"RISKY BUSINESS" MOMENT

11:55.095 --> 11:56.677
WHEN MOM AND DAD
WENT TO TAHOE.

11:56.677 --> 11:59.469
SO UNTIL THEY SAY
OTHERWISE, I OWN YOU.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.221
I COULD MAKE YOU DRESS UP
LIKE ANTHONY HOPKINS

12:01.221 --> 12:02.933
IN "REMAINS OF THE DAY"
AND SERVE ME TEA,

12:02.933 --> 12:04.555
<i>BUT INSTEAD
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO</i>

12:04.555 --> 12:06.557
IS SIT ON YOUR BUTT
AND WATCH A ROOM FULL OF GIRLS

12:06.557 --> 12:08.148
JUMP AROUND UNTIL
SIX‐FRICKEN‐30.

12:08.148 --> 12:09.610
BUT WE'RE MEETING
AT 6:00.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.901
HELLO, MOM?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.943
FINE. WE'RE HERE.
GO SPIN.

12:14.354 --> 12:16.356
MELANIE!

12:16.356 --> 12:20.070
( whispers )
WHY IS YOUR BROTHER HERE?

12:20.070 --> 12:21.121
( mouths )

12:22.242 --> 12:25.786
WHY IS CHARLIE HERE?

12:25.786 --> 12:27.287
( mouths )

12:28.288 --> 12:30.581
WHY IS CHAR‐‐

12:30.581 --> 12:33.423
OH, NEVER MIND.
I'M COMING DOWN.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.641
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
PLACES AT THE BARRE.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.474
WHAT IS YOUR BROTHER
DOING HERE?

12:44.474 --> 12:46.727
OUR PARENTS CAUGHT HIM
WITH BEER ON HIS BREATH
LAST WEEKEND,

12:46.727 --> 12:48.939
AND DRIVING ME EVERYWHERE
I WANT IS HIS PUNISHMENT.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.390
WHY DIDN'T YOU
GIVE ME A HEADS UP?

12:50.390 --> 12:52.192
‐ WHAT FOR?
‐ SO I COULD...

12:52.192 --> 12:54.484
YOU KNOW,
DO STUFF TO MYSELF.

12:54.484 --> 12:57.447
‐ LIKE WHAT?
‐ I DON'T KNOW‐‐
MAKE‐UP,

12:57.447 --> 13:00.741
DIFFERENT LEOTARD,
BAG OVER MY HEAD.

13:00.741 --> 13:04.284
I CAN WAIT UNTIL
YOU'RE ALL DONE TALKING
IF YOU LIKE.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.666
THANK YOU.

13:05.666 --> 13:07.748
‐ ( piano music playing )
‐ PLIES.

13:07.748 --> 13:11.411
AND DEMI AND STRAIGHT.

13:11.411 --> 13:13.624
<i>DEMI AND STRAIGHT.</i>

13:13.624 --> 13:15.005
<i>AND GRAND.</i>

13:18.919 --> 13:20.380
VERY SUBTLE, BOO.

13:32.352 --> 13:33.894
‐ HELLO.
‐ HI THERE.

13:33.894 --> 13:35.696
I'M CLAIRE.
I'M GINNY'S MOM.

13:35.696 --> 13:37.988
WE MET LAST NIGHT,
BUT I'M JUST SURE
IT WAS A BIG BLUR

13:37.988 --> 13:39.359
‐ FOR YOU.
‐ RIGHT. CLAIRE.

13:39.359 --> 13:40.701
GINNY'S MOM.
YES, HI.

13:40.701 --> 13:42.863
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH
SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU,

13:42.863 --> 13:45.205
ABOUT YOUR CAREER
AS A SHOWGIRL IN VEGAS.

13:45.205 --> 13:48.038
‐ I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS.
‐ OH, WELL, DON'T BE.

13:48.038 --> 13:50.120
I JUST WANTED TO OFFER
MY CONDOLENCES AGAIN.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.583
‐ HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP?
‐ UM.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.334
OF COURSE. HOW COULD
YOU BE HOLDING UP?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.716
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

13:55.716 --> 13:57.127
I'M HERE FOR YOU
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

13:57.127 --> 13:59.590
ANYTHING AT ALL.
AND I BROUGHT MY FAMOUS

13:59.590 --> 14:01.632
TACO‐IN‐A‐BAG CASSEROLE.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.923
TACO‐IN‐A‐BAG?

14:02.923 --> 14:04.595
OH, IT'S AN OLD
GIRL SCOUT DISH.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.226
EVERY CAMPER
GETS A BAG OF CHIPS,

14:06.226 --> 14:08.268
THEY PUT IN THEIR
FAVORITE TACO FIXINGS,

14:08.268 --> 14:09.469
THEY CRUNCH
IT ALL UP,

14:09.469 --> 14:12.933
AND VOILA. YOU GOT
TACO IN A BAG.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.354
IT LOOKS REVOLTING,

14:14.354 --> 14:15.736
BUT IT TASTES
LIKE HEAVEN.

14:15.736 --> 14:17.237
OH, AND IT'S
TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

14:17.237 --> 14:18.739
PERFECT.

14:18.739 --> 14:20.070
I'LL POP THIS
IN THE FRIDGE.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.035
‐ <i>OH, VERY SAD SELECTION.
</i> ‐ YEAH, THE BEST ONES WERE EATEN

14:25.035 --> 14:27.157
AT THE MEMORIAL
THE OTHER NIGHT.
THESE ARE THE REJECTS.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.159
ANYWAY, I'LL GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.831
JUST CALL ME
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

14:30.831 --> 14:32.953
‐ I WILL.
‐ YOU KNOW, THE DAY
I LOST MY HUSBAND

14:32.953 --> 14:34.955
WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

14:34.955 --> 14:36.496
OF COURSE I LOST HIM
TO THE DIVORCEE

14:36.496 --> 14:38.629
IN THE JEGGINGS
ACROSS THE STREET

14:38.629 --> 14:39.760
AND NOT IN
A CAR ACCIDENT,

14:39.760 --> 14:41.712
<i>BUT IT STILL HURT.</i>

14:41.712 --> 14:43.173
‐ I'M SURE.
‐ BUT YOU.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.175
YOU POOR THING.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.557
HUBBELL DIDN'T
EVEN LEAVE YOU,

14:46.557 --> 14:48.428
NOT THE WAY
GIL LEFT ME.

14:48.428 --> 14:49.970
YOU WERE
STILL NEWLYWEDS,

14:49.970 --> 14:51.101
STILL IN LOVE.

14:51.101 --> 14:52.513
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE
IN A NEW TOWN,

14:52.513 --> 14:54.725
IN A STRANGE HOUSE,
ALL ALONE.

14:54.725 --> 14:58.188
‐ MUST BE OVERWHELMING.
‐ I THINK I'M STILL
IN THE NUMB PHASE.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.070
OVERWHELMING
IS PROBABLY ON THE WAY.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.111
AND ON TOP
OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

15:01.111 --> 15:02.653
TO BE BURDENED DOWN
WITH ALL THIS,

15:02.653 --> 15:04.985
‐ I CAN'T IMAGINE.
‐ ALL OF WHAT?

15:04.985 --> 15:08.448
‐ ALL THIS.
‐ OH, WELL, THIS IS
FANNY'S STUFF.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.160
SHE LIKES THINGS
THAT STARE.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.532
OH, NO, SWEETIE,
I DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:11.532 --> 15:13.083
I MEAN ALL OF THIS‐‐

15:13.083 --> 15:15.335
THE HOUSE, THE LAND.

15:15.335 --> 15:17.538
OH, WOW.
NEWS TRAVELS FAST.

15:17.538 --> 15:19.880
AROUND HERE,
LIKE A BULLET TRAIN.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.633
‐ YOU EVER OWN LAND BEFORE?
‐ I'VE NEVER OWNED
ANYTHING BEFORE.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.805
I STILL HAVE
A LEATHER JACKET ON LAYAWAY
AT THE FORUM SHOPS.

15:24.805 --> 15:27.137
OH, IT'S A BIG
RESPONSIBILITY.

15:27.137 --> 15:30.010
THE UPKEEP‐‐
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE
YOUR HEAD SPIN.

15:30.010 --> 15:31.972
ANYHOW, IF YOU
SHOULD DECIDE

15:31.972 --> 15:34.645
THAT THIS IS ALL
JUST TOO MUCH FOR YOU,

15:34.645 --> 15:36.146
YOU COULD
GIVE ME A CALL.

15:39.149 --> 15:40.771
<i>GIVE YOU
A CALL TO DO?</i>

15:42.823 --> 15:43.824
YOU'RE A REAL ESTATE AGENT?

15:43.824 --> 15:46.867
TOP SALESPERSON
THREE YEARS RUNNING.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.699
<i>USED TO BE PART TIME,</i>

15:48.699 --> 15:50.450
AND THEN GIL RAN OFF
WITH THAT <i>WHORE</i>

15:50.450 --> 15:53.033
WHO REFUSED
TO BRING HER BARRELS
IN IN THE MORNING.

15:53.033 --> 15:54.535
THAT'S HOW
SHE HOOKED HIM.

15:54.535 --> 15:57.037
<i>FINALLY OFFERED
TO BRING THEM IN FOR HER,</i>

15:57.037 --> 15:58.999
AND IT WAS ALL OVER.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.841
TRASH! HOOKED HIM
WITH TRASH.

16:00.841 --> 16:02.462
YOU'RE GETTING OVER IT
VERY WELL.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.885
I KNOW.
BUT IF YOU EVER DECIDE

16:04.885 --> 16:06.927
THAT YOU WANT
TO SELL THIS PLACE,

16:06.927 --> 16:10.140
I KNOW I COULD GET YOU
A REALLY GOOD PRICE

16:10.140 --> 16:12.052
OH, AND I HAVE
THE MOST ADORABLE

16:12.052 --> 16:13.594
BEACH CONDOS
THAT ARE JUST PERFECT

16:13.594 --> 16:15.516
FOR A SINGLE GIRL
LIKE YOURSELF

16:15.516 --> 16:17.357
BECAUSE ANY WAY
YOU SLICE IT,

16:17.357 --> 16:19.520
SEVEN ACRES IS A LOT.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.481
UH‐‐ I'M SORRY,
HOW MANY ACRES?

16:23.063 --> 16:26.697
HUBBELL BOUGHT THE PLACE
AND WAS SLOWLY FIXING IT UP.

16:26.697 --> 16:28.819
HE GOT TO THE HOUSE,
THE STUDIO

16:28.819 --> 16:31.071
AND A COUPLE
OF THE OTHER STRUCTURES,

16:31.071 --> 16:32.823
‐ YOU SEE THESE TREES?
‐ YES.

16:32.823 --> 16:35.245
THEY ARE IN DESPERATE
NEED OF SOME THINNING.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.037
YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME OUT.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.379
‐ THEY'RE TOO CROWDED.
‐ INTIMACY ISSUES?

16:39.379 --> 16:42.422
THEY'RE GONNA
LEAD TO A SQUIRREL
POPULATION EXPLOSION.

16:42.422 --> 16:44.044
HUBBELL WAS GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THAT

16:44.044 --> 16:45.626
LAST YEAR, BUT NEVER
WENT THROUGH WITH IT.

16:45.626 --> 16:47.628
I THINK THE PRICE
PROBABLY SCARED HIM OFF.

16:47.628 --> 16:49.630
WONDER IF HE EVER
TOOK CARE OF THAT ROOT ROT.

16:49.630 --> 16:51.762
OH, SO HOW MUCH WOULD
IT COST TO THIN THE TREES

16:51.762 --> 16:53.093
SO THE SQUIRRELS
DON'T EXPLODE?

16:53.093 --> 16:55.395
30 TO 40,
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY
TREES YOU HAVE,

16:55.395 --> 16:57.187
AND YOU HAVE
A LOT OF TREES.

16:57.187 --> 16:58.769
$40,000?

16:58.769 --> 17:00.521
HOW'S YOUR DRAINAGE?

17:00.521 --> 17:02.563
‐ DO YOU KNOW?
‐ NO.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.904
YOU SHOULD FIND OUT.

17:03.904 --> 17:05.485
PLUS YOU SHOULD HAVE
THAT LAKE DREDGED,

17:05.485 --> 17:06.486
IT'S BEEN AWHILE.

17:06.486 --> 17:07.738
I HAVE A LAKE?

17:07.738 --> 17:10.280
<i>YOU HAVE ONE LAKE

25:22.022 --> 25:24.695
WHY, LOU?
WHY?

25:24.695 --> 25:26.527
WELL, AWHILE BACK,
TWO COUNTY WORKERS

25:26.527 --> 25:27.698
WENT UP THERE
TO DISCUSS

25:27.698 --> 25:28.859
PUTTING IN
A CELLPHONE TOWER

25:28.859 --> 25:30.701
AND NO ONE EVER
SAW THEM AGAIN.

25:30.701 --> 25:32.703
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT TWO PEOPLE

25:32.703 --> 25:34.955
WENT UP THERE,
DISAPPEARED,

25:34.955 --> 25:36.617
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

25:36.617 --> 25:38.288
PRIVATE ROAD.

25:38.288 --> 25:39.620
<i>( car door opens )</i>

25:41.121 --> 25:42.963
‐ HEY‐O, CLAYTON.
‐ HEY, LOU.

25:42.963 --> 25:44.294
THANK GOD.
OFFICER CLAYTON,

25:44.294 --> 25:46.046
WILL YOU PLEASE
GIVE LOU PERMISSION

25:46.046 --> 25:47.878
TO MOVE HIS TRUCK
THREE FEET

25:47.878 --> 25:48.969
SO I CAN
GET A TOW?

25:48.969 --> 25:50.090
OH, BOY.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.171
LET ME GUESS.
PRIVATE ROAD?

25:51.171 --> 25:52.513
‐ PRIVATE ROAD.
‐ ALL RIGHT,

25:52.513 --> 25:53.724
FIRST OF ALL,
MAY I POINT OUT

25:53.724 --> 25:54.885
THAT THERE'S
NO SIGNS?

25:54.885 --> 25:56.436
OH, WE DON'T LIKE
SIGNS AROUND HERE,

25:56.436 --> 25:57.518
MARS THE LANDSCAPE.

25:57.518 --> 25:58.729
DID YOU KNOW YOU
WERE ENTERING

25:58.729 --> 25:59.730
A PRIVATE ROAD?

25:59.730 --> 26:01.311
NO, 'CAUSE
THERE'S NO SIGN!

26:01.311 --> 26:02.312
NO NEED TO YELL.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.393
I'M NOT YELLING!

26:03.393 --> 26:04.394
ALL RIGHT, I'M YELLING
A LITTLE BIT,

26:04.394 --> 26:05.395
BUT THERE IS
NO SIGN!

26:05.395 --> 26:06.647
EVERYBODY AROUND
HERE KNOWS

26:06.647 --> 26:07.778
THAT'S
A PRIVATE ROAD.

26:07.778 --> 26:09.820
( groans )
WELL, I'M FREAKIN' NEW.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.822
OH, ALL RIGHT.

26:11.822 --> 26:13.193
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

26:13.193 --> 26:15.405
NOTHING
JUST YET.

26:15.405 --> 26:16.997
YOU'RE WRITING.
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

26:16.997 --> 26:17.998
GOTTA GIVE YOU
A TICKET.

26:17.998 --> 26:19.039
A TICKET?
FOR WHAT?

26:19.039 --> 26:20.871
WELL, TRESPASSING
FOR STARTERS.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.543
YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME!

26:22.543 --> 26:24.464
PLEASE, LET'S KEEP
THE TONE CIVIL, MA'AM

26:24.464 --> 26:26.336
AND COULD YOU COME ON
DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

26:26.336 --> 26:27.337
NO.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.010
‐ NO?
‐ NO. YOU COME UP HERE.

26:30.010 --> 26:31.341
IT'S A PRIVATE ROAD.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.093
WELL, NOW,
IF I HAVE TO

26:33.093 --> 26:34.094
COME UP THERE,

26:34.094 --> 26:35.766
<i>IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD.</i>

26:35.766 --> 26:37.217
MAKE MY DAY.

26:39.770 --> 26:42.222
WELL.

26:42.222 --> 26:44.144
THIS MUST BE SOME KIND
OF RECORD FOR YOU.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.686
THREE DAYS
IN A NEW TOWN

26:45.686 --> 26:46.937
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
HANDCUFFED

26:46.937 --> 26:48.108
IN THE BACK
OF A POLICE CAR.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.610
I'M ZIP‐TIED.
NOT HANDCUFFED.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.281
OH. IS THERE
A DIFFERENCE?

26:51.281 --> 26:52.693
THERE'S SO MANY
INTERESTING THINGS

26:52.693 --> 26:54.825
‐ I CAN LEARN FROM YOU.
‐ THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS.

26:54.825 --> 26:56.446
I HAVE RIGHTS!

26:56.446 --> 26:58.158
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D KEEP THAT SENTIMENT

26:58.158 --> 26:59.239
TO MYSELF.

26:59.239 --> 27:01.501
COME ON.
I SPRUNG YOU.

27:01.501 --> 27:02.873
IS THAT THE PROPER
LINGO?

27:05.586 --> 27:07.377
OH GOD.

27:10.050 --> 27:12.252
ALL RIGHT, CLAYTON.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

27:12.252 --> 27:14.925
WE'LL JUST CALL IT
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

27:14.925 --> 27:15.966
THANK YOU.

27:15.966 --> 27:17.137
MM‐HMM.

27:27.728 --> 27:29.189
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY
I SWING DANCE

27:29.189 --> 27:31.862
WITH THE POLICE
CHIEF.

27:31.862 --> 27:32.943
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

27:32.943 --> 27:34.154
I GOTTA GET
HUBBELL'S CAR BACK.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.826
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO DO THAT, EXACTLY?

27:35.826 --> 27:37.988
I THINK I'M GONNA FLY BY
THE SEAT OF MY PANTS
ON THIS ONE.

27:37.988 --> 27:39.409
YOU JUST GOT
ARRESTED FOR DOING

27:39.409 --> 27:40.581
WHAT YOU'RE
DOING AGAIN.

27:40.581 --> 27:42.412
WELL, FORTUNATELY,
MY MOTHER‐IN‐LAW

27:42.412 --> 27:43.914
SWING DANCES WITH
THE POLICE CHIEF.

27:47.337 --> 27:48.669
( sighs )

27:51.882 --> 27:53.884
( girls chattering, giggling )

27:55.966 --> 27:57.427
COME ON, BOO.
SLEEP OVER.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.510
THANKS, BUT I'M REALLY
NOT IN THE MOOD.

27:59.510 --> 28:02.102
IF YOU COME, IT'LL BE
A REAL SLEEP OVER PARTY

28:02.102 --> 28:03.764
INSTEAD OF JUST ME AND MEL
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

28:03.764 --> 28:06.517
‐ MM.
‐ THAT SOUNDED WRONG.

28:06.517 --> 28:08.358
IT SOUNDED LIKE
YOU ARE MY LOV‐AH.

28:08.358 --> 28:10.110
AND I AM NOT
YOUR LOV‐AH.

28:10.110 --> 28:11.361
YOU GUYS
ARE NUTS.

28:11.361 --> 28:12.362
DON'T YOU WANT
ANOTHER SHOT

28:12.362 --> 28:13.443
‐ WITH MY BROTHER?
‐ WE CAN HELP.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.575
WE'LL COME UP
WITH A PLAN.

28:14.575 --> 28:16.156
I THINK CHARLIE'S
HAD ENOUGH OF ME

28:16.156 --> 28:17.157
FOR ONE DAY.

28:17.157 --> 28:18.448
I'M JUST
GONNA GO HOME,

28:18.448 --> 28:19.910
SIT IN A DARK CLOSET

28:19.910 --> 28:21.532
WHERE NO ONE
CAN STARE AT ME.

28:21.532 --> 28:22.663
I COULD KILL SASHA.

28:22.663 --> 28:24.324
I KNOW. SOMETIMES
SHE'S SO AWFUL.

28:24.324 --> 28:25.916
SERIOUSLY, I WAS READY
TO STRANGLE HER.

28:25.916 --> 28:27.998
AND SHE'S GOT THAT
SKINNY STRANGLABLE NECK.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.169
Melanie:
<i>MINIMAL EFFORT REQUIRED.</i>

28:29.169 --> 28:30.330
Ginny:
<i>I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE</i>

28:30.330 --> 28:31.712
A MEAN GIRLFRIEND
IN HIGH SCHOOL‐‐

28:31.712 --> 28:32.793
I'VE SEEN
ALL THE MOVIES‐‐

28:32.793 --> 28:35.005
BUT THIS IS GETTING
REALLY EXHAUSTING.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.006
YEAH, ONE DAY
SHE'S NICE,

28:36.006 --> 28:37.007
THE NEXT DAY,
SHE'S THIS.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.599
HMM. WE SHOULD FORCE
HER TO WEAR A SIGN

28:38.599 --> 28:39.680
SO WE'RE PREPARED.

28:39.680 --> 28:40.931
YEAH. "HI, I'M SASHA,

28:40.931 --> 28:42.472
AND TODAY I'M GOING
TO BE A COLOSSAL BITCH."

28:42.472 --> 28:43.684
YOU SHOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT SASHA LIKE THAT

28:43.684 --> 28:44.805
BEHIND HER BACK.

28:44.805 --> 28:46.517
<i>SHE WAS SO MEAN
TO YOU TODAY IN CLASS.</i>

28:46.517 --> 28:47.608
SHE'S HAVING
A BAD DAY.

28:47.608 --> 28:48.729
SEEMS LIKE EVERY
DAY NOWADAYS

28:48.729 --> 28:49.810
IS A BAD DAY.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.692
SERIOUSLY, BOO.
HOW CAN YOU DEFEND HER

28:51.692 --> 28:52.773
AFTER WHAT SHE DID?

28:52.773 --> 28:54.154
WHO KNOWS WHAT
SHE'S GOING THROUGH?

28:54.154 --> 28:55.696
SHE'S GOT
A LOT OF ISSUES

28:55.696 --> 28:57.157
AND WEIRD THINGS
GOING ON AT HOME.

28:57.157 --> 28:59.159
AND THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY SHE ACTS THAT WAY.

28:59.159 --> 29:01.411
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE
LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE

29:01.411 --> 29:02.863
<i>IT ALL TOGETHER,
BUT WHO KNOWS</i>

29:02.863 --> 29:04.745
WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON?

29:04.745 --> 29:06.496
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

29:06.496 --> 29:07.497
TO BE ME, BOO.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.079
SO DON'T PSYCHOANALYZE ME,

29:09.079 --> 29:10.751
FEEL SORRY FOR ME
OR DEFEND ME.

29:10.751 --> 29:12.583
I'M FINE.

29:12.583 --> 29:13.584
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO HIDE

29:13.584 --> 29:15.295
IN THE BACK
OF THE ROOM.

29:25.596 --> 29:26.597
( people chattering )

29:26.597 --> 29:27.848
<i>COME ON, LET'S GO.</i>

29:27.848 --> 29:30.060
<i>‐ BYE.
‐ BYE.</i>

29:30.060 --> 29:31.061
<i>GIRLS.</i>

29:33.313 --> 29:34.735
HEY, NANETTE,
MAKE BOO CHANGE HER MIND

29:34.735 --> 29:35.776
AND COME SLEEP OVER.

29:35.776 --> 29:36.777
YEAH, WE NEED HER.

29:36.777 --> 29:37.778
WE DO.
WE BORE EACH OTHER.

29:37.778 --> 29:39.780
‐ A LOT.
‐ ( laughs )

29:43.534 --> 29:44.665
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
HAVING A SLEEP OVER.

29:44.665 --> 29:45.866
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT TO GO?

29:45.866 --> 29:46.997
OH, BECAUSE,

29:46.997 --> 29:48.789
I HAVE HOMEWORK,
AND THE ADULT THING TO DO

29:48.789 --> 29:50.791
IS TO STAY HOME
AND DO IT.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.753
OKAY, BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

29:52.753 --> 29:54.625
‐ WHY?
‐ BECAUSE YOU'RE
ONLY YOUNG ONCE,

29:54.625 --> 29:55.876
AND DINNER
AT HOME TONIGHT

29:55.876 --> 29:56.877
IS GOING TO BE
TERRIBLE.

29:56.877 --> 29:58.679
I'M SERIOUS.
SAVE YOURSELF.

29:58.679 --> 29:59.880
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:59.880 --> 30:01.221
WELL I FINALLY
MADE A RECIPE

30:01.221 --> 30:02.302
FROM THAT NEW
LIGHT COOKBOOK,

30:02.302 --> 30:03.303
THE ONE YOU
MADE ME BUY.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.805
‐ THANKS, MOM.
‐ DO NOT THANK ME.

30:04.805 --> 30:05.886
I AM THANKING YOU.

30:05.886 --> 30:07.017
IT'S LIGHT
MACARONI AND CHEESE.

30:07.017 --> 30:08.428
THEN DOUBLE
THANK YOU.

30:08.428 --> 30:10.691
YEAH, SEE,
THERE'S A SMELL.

30:10.691 --> 30:11.772
A SMELL?

30:11.772 --> 30:12.983
THE ENTIRE
HOUSE SMELLS.

30:12.983 --> 30:14.775
NOW I HAVE NEVER
SMELLED A DEAD FOOT BEFORE

30:14.775 --> 30:16.026
‐ BUT‐‐
‐ I'M SURE DINNER

30:16.026 --> 30:17.317
WILL BE HEALTHY,
AND GOOD,

30:17.317 --> 30:18.529
AND I LOVE YOU
FOR TRYING.

30:18.529 --> 30:19.780
SNIFF MY SHIRT.

30:19.780 --> 30:20.781
WHAT?

30:20.781 --> 30:21.782
SNIFF IT.

30:22.903 --> 30:24.444
( sniffs )

30:24.444 --> 30:25.445
( laughs )

30:25.445 --> 30:27.327
TOLD YOU
IT WAS BAD.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.159
WOW. THAT IS...

30:29.159 --> 30:30.500
‐ SO BAD.
‐ DEAD FOOT?

30:30.500 --> 30:33.003
‐ TOTAL DEAD FOOT.
‐ ( laughing )

30:33.003 --> 30:35.375
HOW IS THAT SMELL
EVEN POSSIBLE?

30:35.375 --> 30:37.007
IT'S LIKE I CAN'T
STOP MYSELF.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.458
MAYBE THAT'S
THE DIET.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.671
( laughing )

30:48.018 --> 30:51.021
NA‐AH‐AH‐AH.
LAP, PLEASE.

30:51.021 --> 30:54.064
YOU WOULD NOT EVEN
BELIEVE MY DAY. HARROWING.

30:54.064 --> 30:55.686
"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"
AND I'M SHELLY WINTERS.

30:55.686 --> 30:58.028
I AM A KNOT,
ONE GIANT KNOT.

30:58.028 --> 30:59.530
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT DINNER.

30:59.530 --> 31:00.941
I'VE SCHEDULED
A MASSAGE FOR TONIGHT.

31:00.941 --> 31:02.943
HENRI JUST BARELY
MANAGED TO SQUEEZE ME IN,

31:02.943 --> 31:04.745
AND YOUR FATHER
IS GOING TO BE OUT LATE

31:04.745 --> 31:06.036
AGAIN.

31:06.036 --> 31:07.698
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

31:07.698 --> 31:08.949
THERE'S TAKE‐OUT

31:08.949 --> 31:10.410
OR SOMETHING FROZEN.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.872
I THINK.

31:11.872 --> 31:14.204
DO YOU JUST WANT
TO GO HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

31:14.204 --> 31:15.546
NO.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.549
OKAY.

31:27.848 --> 31:30.851
( panting )

31:41.321 --> 31:42.523
‐ HELLO.
‐ WHY?

31:42.523 --> 31:44.865
WHY, WHY DOES ANYONE
HAVE TO LIVE SO FAR AWAY

31:44.865 --> 31:45.906
FROM CIVILIZATION?

31:45.906 --> 31:46.907
‐ PARDON ME?
‐ I MEAN,

31:46.907 --> 31:48.028
THIS PRIVATE ROAD
OF YOURS

31:48.028 --> 31:49.199
IS REALLY MISLEADING.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.531
YOU GO UP
A STRAIGHT‐AWAY,

31:50.531 --> 31:52.122
YOU THINK YOU'RE
ALMOST AT THE HOUSE,

31:52.122 --> 31:53.874
YOU ROUND A BEND,
MORE STRAIGHT‐AWAY.

31:53.874 --> 31:55.706
SO YOU GO UP THAT,
YOU ROUND A BEND,

31:55.706 --> 31:56.707
MORE STRAIGHT‐AWAY.

31:56.707 --> 31:57.708
AND ON AND ON.

31:57.708 --> 31:58.999
YOU GET SOME KIND
OF DEAL

31:58.999 --> 32:00.801
WITH STRAIGHT‐AWAYS?
YOU HAD A COUPON
OR SOMETHING?

32:00.801 --> 32:01.802
MAY I ASK
WHO YOU ARE?

32:01.802 --> 32:02.883
HAVE I NOT
INTRODUCED MYSELF?

32:02.883 --> 32:04.885
‐ NO.
‐ YOU HAD NO SIGN.

32:04.885 --> 32:06.426
‐ WHAT?
‐ YOU HAVE
NO PRIVATE‐ROAD SIGN,

32:06.426 --> 32:07.598
AND MY CAR DIED,

32:07.598 --> 32:09.469
AND I GOT ARRESTED,
AND I MUST SOUND LIKE A LOON.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.601
IT'S ALL A BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING,

32:10.601 --> 32:11.892
‐ DO YOU HAVE ANY WATER?
‐ SURE.

32:11.892 --> 32:13.053
I'M GRANT.

32:13.053 --> 32:14.685
OH, HAVE I STILL NOT
INTRODUCED MYSELF?

32:14.685 --> 32:16.687
‐ NO.
‐ OH, IT'S THOSE
STRAIGHT‐AWAYS.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.939
THEY SUCK THE POLITENESS
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD,

32:18.939 --> 32:19.940
I'M MICHELLE.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.021
COME ON IN,
MICHELLE.

32:21.021 --> 32:23.273
WAIT A SECOND.

32:23.273 --> 32:24.945
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE
CELL PHONE TOWER GUYS.

32:24.945 --> 32:27.487
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:28.699 --> 32:29.910
OKAY.

32:32.412 --> 32:33.744
YOU HAVE
A VERY LARGE DOOR.

32:33.744 --> 32:37.417
THAT'S WHAT ALL
THE LADIES SAY.

32:37.417 --> 32:38.749
WOW, THIS PLACE
IS SO COOL.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.632
I'LL GET THAT
WATER FOR YOU.

32:41.632 --> 32:43.504
OH, YOU HAVE A VIEW.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.295
HELP ME OUT,
WHAT SHOULD I BE LOOKING FOR?

32:45.295 --> 32:48.048
<i>UH, WHALES,
DOLPHINS, SEALS.</i>

32:48.048 --> 32:49.510
UH, THERE'S
A NUDE BEACH

32:49.510 --> 32:51.512
ABOUT TWO MILES
UP TO THE LEFT.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.594
AAH! WHY IS IT THAT
THE PEOPLE ON NUDE BEACHES...

32:53.594 --> 32:55.265
ARE NEVER THE ONES
YOU WANT TO SEE NAKED?

32:55.265 --> 32:56.767
‐ I DON'T KNOW.
‐ WHY DO YOU LOOK?

32:56.767 --> 32:57.858
I CAN'T HELP IT.

32:57.858 --> 33:00.060
IT'S A BIOLOGICAL
DISASTER ZONE.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.402
IT'S LIKE TWO MILES
OF DALI PAINTINGS

33:02.402 --> 33:03.524
WALKING AROUND FREE.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.816
‐ ( sighs )
‐ ( chuckles )

33:05.816 --> 33:07.027
SO, YOUR CAR?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.198
YES.

33:08.198 --> 33:09.740
IT BROKE DOWN
AT THE BASE OF THE ROAD,

33:09.740 --> 33:10.741
AND NO ONE
WILL TOW IT

33:10.741 --> 33:11.782
BECAUSE IT'S
A PRIVATE ROAD‐‐

33:11.782 --> 33:13.073
COMPLETELY UNMARKED,
BY THE WAY.

33:13.073 --> 33:14.414
I KEEP PUTTING
SIGNS UP,

33:14.414 --> 33:15.746
BUT THERE'S
THIS LOCAL COP

33:15.746 --> 33:17.117
WHO DRIVES BY AT NIGHT
AND STEALS THEM.

33:17.117 --> 33:18.208
‐ BAD MUSTACHE?
‐ YEP.

33:18.208 --> 33:19.750
THAT DUDE JUST TRIED
TO ARREST ME.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.672
I'M GONNA TALK
TO MY CHAUFFEUR
ABOUT YOUR CAR.

33:21.672 --> 33:23.123
HE KNOWS CARS.

33:23.123 --> 33:24.214
YOU HAVE
A CHAUFFEUR?

33:24.214 --> 33:25.546
WOW.

33:25.546 --> 33:27.007
BARRY MANILOW
HAS A CHAUFFEUR.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.679
I WORKED WITH HIM
A FEW TIMES IN VEGAS.

33:28.679 --> 33:30.130
REALLY? AS WHAT?

33:30.130 --> 33:31.431
DANCER.

33:31.431 --> 33:33.223
I'M A DANCER.
WAS A DANCER.

33:33.223 --> 33:34.224
YOU QUIT?

33:34.224 --> 33:36.096
MANILOW? NO NO,
THE GIG ENDED.

33:36.096 --> 33:37.137
BUT SERIOUSLY
HOW MANY TIMES

33:37.137 --> 33:38.138
CAN YOU HEAR
"COPACABANA"

33:38.138 --> 33:39.309
WITHOUT TOTALLY
SIDING WITH RICO?

33:39.309 --> 33:40.771
NO. YOU QUIT DANCING?

33:40.771 --> 33:43.353
OH.

33:43.353 --> 33:45.105
DID YOU KNOW THAT
HE FLIES HOME EVERY NIGHT

33:45.105 --> 33:46.146
TO PALM SPRINGS?

33:46.146 --> 33:47.197
WHEN HE PLAYS VEGAS?

33:47.197 --> 33:48.779
WHO?

33:48.779 --> 33:49.910
MANILOW.
JUST SO HE CAN SLEEP

33:49.910 --> 33:51.281
IN HIS OWN BED.
THAT'S RICH.

33:54.154 --> 33:56.246
HEY, RUSTY.
YEAH, I GOT A FRIEND

33:56.246 --> 33:57.578
WHO HAS A PROBLEM
WITH HER CAR.

33:57.578 --> 33:59.249
DO YOU MIND
TAKING A LOOK AT IT?

33:59.249 --> 34:01.501
YEAH, IT'S AT THE BASE
OF THE DRIVEWAY. THANKS.

34:01.501 --> 34:03.253
YOU'RE CALLING
THAT AUTOBAHN YOU HAVE

34:03.253 --> 34:06.126
ON YOUR PROPERTY
A DRIVEWAY?

34:06.126 --> 34:07.127
BOY, YOU ARE RICH.

34:07.127 --> 34:08.128
YOU'RE MANILOW RICH.

34:08.128 --> 34:10.671
SO TELL ME,
WHAT INSPIRED YOU

34:10.671 --> 34:12.513
TO BECOME THE MYSTERY MAN

34:12.513 --> 34:14.344
OF PARADISE,
CALIFORNIA ANYHOW?

34:14.344 --> 34:15.345
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:15.345 --> 34:16.476
<i>WELL, I BET YOU
COULD LIVE</i>

34:16.476 --> 34:18.849
<i>ANYWHERE YOU WANTED,
WHY HERE?</i>

34:18.849 --> 34:21.141
WELL, I BOUGHT THIS PLACE
YEARS AGO AS AN INVESTMENT,

34:21.141 --> 34:22.482
BUT LATELY I'VE
BEEN SPENDING

34:22.482 --> 34:23.483
MORE AND MORE
TIME HERE,

34:23.483 --> 34:24.815
AND I LIKE IT.

34:24.815 --> 34:26.396
I HIKE, I RIDE
MY MOUNTAIN BIKE,

34:26.396 --> 34:28.028
SURF, READ.

34:28.028 --> 34:29.029
IT'S A NICE LIFE.

34:29.029 --> 34:30.611
I JUST GOT HERE

34:30.611 --> 34:32.362
TWO DAYS AGO.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.364
I'M THAT GIRL, YOU KNOW,
THE ONE THAT MARRIED THE GUY

34:34.364 --> 34:36.867
IN VEGAS. I'M NOT HAVING
ANY WINE BY THE WAY.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.198
THIS ISN'T
FOR YOU.

34:38.198 --> 34:39.960
YOU KNOW, WE CAME HERE,

34:39.960 --> 34:41.161
THERE WAS A PARTY,

34:41.161 --> 34:42.412
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

34:42.412 --> 34:44.705
IT WAS THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE "PARADISE GAZETTE."

34:44.705 --> 34:46.296
I DON'T GET
THE "GAZETTE."

34:46.296 --> 34:47.337
PAPER BOY WON'T
COME UP THE‐‐

34:47.337 --> 34:48.378
PRIVATE ROAD.

34:48.378 --> 34:49.419
OH, YEAH, SURE.

34:49.419 --> 34:51.381
ANYHOW, UM,

34:51.381 --> 34:52.973
NOW I'M HERE AND...

34:52.973 --> 34:54.715
I'M KIND OF STUCK,

34:54.715 --> 34:56.637
STUCK WITH A HOUSE
AND ACREAGE,

34:56.637 --> 34:58.769
LAKE, A COUPLE PONDS.

34:58.769 --> 34:59.850
IT'S NOT ME,
YOU KNOW?

34:59.850 --> 35:01.431
I'M NOT A LAND OWNER.

35:01.431 --> 35:02.563
I'M MORE OF A RENTER.

35:02.563 --> 35:04.104
AND NOT A LAND
RENTER EITHER,

35:04.104 --> 35:05.185
AN APARTMENT RENTER‐‐

35:05.185 --> 35:06.647
A STUDIO APARTMENT
RENTER.

35:06.647 --> 35:07.648
I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO TELL YOU

35:07.648 --> 35:08.649
THE LONGEST LEASE
I EVER SIGNED‐‐

35:08.649 --> 35:09.690
‐ SIX MONTHS.
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW

35:09.690 --> 35:10.731
THERE WERE
SIX‐MONTH LEASES.

35:10.731 --> 35:12.322
OH, THERE ARE.
AND I HAVE SIGNED THEM.

35:12.322 --> 35:13.904
AND THEN WORRIED
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS

35:13.904 --> 35:16.657
THAT I WAS TRAPPED IN SOME
HUGE, BINDING LEGAL COMMITMENT

35:16.657 --> 35:18.539
THAT WOULD RUIN MY LIFE
IF SOMETHING FABULOUS

35:18.539 --> 35:19.910
CAME ALONG AND
I COULDN'T SEIZE IT,

35:19.910 --> 35:21.331
FOLLOW IT
OR MOVE IN WITH IT.

35:21.331 --> 35:22.743
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM.

35:22.743 --> 35:24.334
YES. THAT'S IT.

35:24.334 --> 35:25.796
THAT'S IT.
I'M A FREE SPIRIT.

35:25.796 --> 35:28.128
I'M A‐‐
I'M A ROLLING STONE.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.460
I'M A DUST IN THE AIR
KIND OF GIRL.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.592
WIND.

35:31.592 --> 35:33.884
WIND. WHAT'S WIND
TO YOU IS AIR TO ME, PAL.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.926
POINT IS,
I CAN'T BE NAILED DOWN.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.258
I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT TERMITES,

35:38.258 --> 35:39.930
OR CORROSION.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.022
YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME
I HAD A CONVERSATION

35:42.022 --> 35:43.353
ABOUT SEPTIC TANKS?

35:43.353 --> 35:44.434
‐ NOPE.
‐ NEVER!

35:44.434 --> 35:45.686
NEVER IS THE LAST TIME.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.267
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
THERE WAS A SCENARIO

35:47.267 --> 35:48.478
AFTER THE 1800s

35:48.478 --> 35:50.360
WHERE PEOPLE CRAPPED
IN THE GROUND BEHIND THEIR HOUSE

35:50.360 --> 35:51.572
AND THEN JUST
LEFT IT THERE.

35:51.572 --> 35:52.613
BUT APPARENTLY
THERE IS,

35:52.613 --> 35:54.234
AND SUDDENLY,
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT,

35:54.234 --> 35:55.275
TALKING ABOUT IT.

35:55.275 --> 35:56.737
I'M SEPTIC TANK GIRL.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.829
I WOULDN'T REPEAT
"SEPTIC TANK GIRL"

35:58.829 --> 35:59.910
IF I WERE YOU.

35:59.910 --> 36:01.121
YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ONCE

36:01.121 --> 36:02.122
AROUND HERE,
AND IT STICKS.

36:02.122 --> 36:03.123
THAT'S HOW I GOT
THE NAME "BILL."

36:03.123 --> 36:05.165
I COULD SELL THE PLACE.

36:05.165 --> 36:07.588
IT'S MINE TO SELL.

36:07.588 --> 36:09.459
I DON'T WANT ROOTS.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.051
AND THE ROOTS
ARE ROTTING ANYWAY.

36:12.252 --> 36:13.634
‐ ROTTING?
‐ MM.

36:13.634 --> 36:15.295
THE TREE ROOTS‐‐
THEY'RE ROTTING UNDERGROUND

36:15.295 --> 36:16.507
AND ALL THE TREES
ARE GONNA FALL DOWN

36:16.507 --> 36:18.098
UNLESS I SPEND
$40,000 ON THEM.

36:18.098 --> 36:19.299
$40,000‐‐

36:19.299 --> 36:21.061
AND THE SEA AIR
IS EATING EVERYTHING.

36:21.061 --> 36:22.142
AND THE SQUIRRELS
ARE ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

36:22.142 --> 36:23.143
CAN I ASK YOU
WHERE YOU GET

36:23.143 --> 36:24.144
YOUR INFORMATION?

36:24.144 --> 36:25.806
A REAL ESTATE AGENT.

36:25.806 --> 36:27.808
OH, GOD. YOU'RE NOT
DEALING WITH CLAIRE,
ARE YOU?

36:27.808 --> 36:28.939
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.230
‐ REALLY?
‐ CLAIRE'S AN IDIOT.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.231
‐ SHE IS?
‐ YEAH.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.193
OH, GREAT.

36:33.193 --> 36:35.405
YEAH. I THOUGHT
THAT BARK BEETLE STUFF

36:35.405 --> 36:36.486
SOUNDED FISHY.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.278
BARK BEETLES?
YOU HAVE BARK BEETLES?

36:38.278 --> 36:39.950
‐ EESH.
‐ EESH? WHY EESH?

36:39.950 --> 36:40.951
WELL, THOSE ARE TOUGH.

36:40.951 --> 36:41.952
CRAP.

36:41.952 --> 36:43.283
NO, IT'S OKAY.
THERE'S A SPRAY.

36:43.283 --> 36:44.494
‐ A SPRAY?
‐ YEAH.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.416
WORKS LIKE MAGIC
AND IT WON'T COST YOU

36:46.416 --> 36:48.168
$40,000,
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

36:48.168 --> 36:49.169
I GET YOUR POINT.

36:49.169 --> 36:51.542
HOME OWNERSHIP ISN'T
FOR EVERYONE.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.003
IT'S A COMMITMENT.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.505
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
YOU REALLY WANT IT.

36:54.505 --> 36:55.506
YEAH.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.178
YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL.

36:58.178 --> 36:59.510
AND SELL MY
MOTHER‐IN‐LAW WITH IT.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.511
I CAN'T DO
THAT TO HER.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.182
WELL, GIVE HER A CUT.

37:02.182 --> 37:03.433
BIG CUT.

37:03.433 --> 37:04.555
SHE COULD BUY
A NICE CONDO,

37:04.555 --> 37:05.766
AND YOU CAN
GO HOME.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.518
HOME. WHERE?

37:07.518 --> 37:08.559
BACK TO VEGAS.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.190
VEGAS ISN'T
MY HOME.

37:10.190 --> 37:11.311
IT'S JUST
WHERE I LIVED

37:11.311 --> 37:12.352
FOR THE PAST
8 YEARS.

37:12.352 --> 37:14.194
GOD HELP ME
IF VEGAS IS MY HOME.

37:14.194 --> 37:16.116
IT'S NOBODY'S HOME.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT MANILOW.

37:16.116 --> 37:18.118
OKAY. SO‐‐
SO IF NOT VEGAS,

37:18.118 --> 37:19.319
THEN WHERE?

37:19.319 --> 37:21.121
I MEAN IF YOU COULD
GO LIVE ANYWHERE,

37:21.121 --> 37:22.322
WHERE WOULD IT BE?

37:22.322 --> 37:23.363
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU HAVE ANYTHING

37:23.363 --> 37:24.454
KEEPING YOU HERE.

37:24.454 --> 37:25.706
SO WHERE?

37:25.706 --> 37:27.207
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

37:30.671 --> 37:32.212
OH, WOW.
THEY WON.

37:32.212 --> 37:34.134
‐ WHO DID?
‐ THE GIRLS FROM
THE DANCE STUDIO.

37:34.134 --> 37:36.006
PART OF MY INHERITANCE.

37:36.006 --> 37:38.048
THEY HAD THIS
UGLIEST FEET COMPETITION

37:38.048 --> 37:39.139
AND THEY WON!

37:39.139 --> 37:40.721
THEY HAVE THE MOST
DISGUSTING FEET

37:40.721 --> 37:43.554
WHICH IS AWESOME
AND... WOW.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.015
TOTALLY TRUE.
YIKES.

37:45.015 --> 37:46.727
OH GOD. YEAH, WELL,
GOOD FOR THEM.

37:46.727 --> 37:48.689
A DANCER WITH
A DANCE STUDIO.

37:48.689 --> 37:50.230
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE SOMETHING.

37:52.232 --> 37:53.233
YEAH.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.067
WELL.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.069
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WILL
HAVE SOME OF THAT WINE.

37:59.069 --> 38:01.361
OH, THIS ISN'T
FOR YOU.

38:01.361 --> 38:02.573
IT ISN'T? I THOUGHT
YOU WERE KIDDING.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.074
NO, I HAVE SOMEBODY
COMING IN A FEW MINUTES.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.165
YOU HAVE A DATE?

38:05.165 --> 38:06.907
IF SHE HASN'T BEEN
ARRESTED, YES.

38:06.907 --> 38:08.579
OH MY GOD. I'LL GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.410
NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN STAY
UNTIL SHE GETS HERE.

38:10.410 --> 38:12.042
NO, YOU'VE ALREADY
DONE ENOUGH.

38:12.042 --> 38:14.374
UM. I'LL GO
CHECK WITH RUSTY

38:14.374 --> 38:15.916
ON THE CAR.

38:15.916 --> 38:17.758
THANK YOU, THOUGH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

38:17.758 --> 38:18.919
I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT.

38:20.631 --> 38:21.722
CAN I HAVE A RIDE?

38:21.722 --> 38:22.763
‐ SURE.
‐ THANK YOU.

38:54.044 --> 38:55.215
BOY, YOU REALLY
WANT TO GET

38:55.215 --> 38:57.127
A GOOD SPOT
FOR CLASS TOMORROW.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.089
‐ WHAT YOU DOING?
‐ LEAVING.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.551
OH, DON'T LET ME CHASE
YOU OUT OF A PLACE

39:00.551 --> 39:01.922
YOU'RE REALLY NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE IN.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.383
MADAME FANNY SAYS
WE CAN COME HERE

39:03.383 --> 39:04.725
ANY TIME WE WANT.

39:04.725 --> 39:05.766
IT'S PRETTY LATE.

39:05.766 --> 39:06.927
‐ IS IT?
‐ NO CURFEW?

39:06.927 --> 39:08.058
NOPE.

39:08.058 --> 39:09.229
DO YOUR PARENTS
KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

39:10.430 --> 39:11.431
NOPE.

39:11.431 --> 39:12.973
WHERE DO THEY
THINK YOU ARE?

39:12.973 --> 39:14.024
IN MY BEDROOM.

39:14.024 --> 39:16.396
WINDOW, TREE BRANCH,
DRAINPIPE COMBO?

39:16.396 --> 39:17.568
BACK STAIRCASE,

39:17.568 --> 39:19.570
KITCHEN DOOR,
SIDE GATE EXIT.

39:19.570 --> 39:21.071
BOLD. AN IN‐HOUSE ESCAPE.

39:22.533 --> 39:24.745
WHAT IF THEY GO IN YOUR ROOM
AND SEE YOU'RE NOT THERE?

39:24.745 --> 39:25.906
THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

39:25.906 --> 39:27.077
‐ <i>BUT IF IT DID.
</i> ‐ IT DOESN'T.

39:27.077 --> 39:28.949
‐ LET'S PRETEND.
‐ I'M NOT SIX.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.120
HUMOR ME.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.251
( sighs )
THEN I'LL TELL THEM

39:31.251 --> 39:32.873
I WAS AT GINNY'S,
AND WE FELL ASLEEP,

39:32.873 --> 39:34.204
AND I CALLED
BUT NO ONE ANSWERED,

39:34.204 --> 39:35.455
WHICH IS PERFECTLY
PLAUSIBLE BECAUSE

39:35.455 --> 39:37.257
THEY SLEEP WITH
SUPERSONIC EARPLUGS,

39:37.257 --> 39:38.589
AND THERE'S NO PHONE
IN THEIR ROOM.

39:38.589 --> 39:41.131
NICE. GOOD.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.593
I OCCASIONALLY USED

39:42.593 --> 39:44.344
THE "I WAS IN
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY

39:44.344 --> 39:46.807
AND THE JANITOR
ACCIDENTALLY LOCKED ME IN.

39:46.807 --> 39:48.138
AND THIS IS NOT
A HICKEY ON MY NECK.

39:48.138 --> 39:49.770
HOW COULD I GET A HICKEY
LOCKED IN THE LIBRARY

39:49.770 --> 39:50.771
ALL NIGHT?" STORY.

39:50.771 --> 39:52.142
AND THEY BELIEVED THAT?

39:52.142 --> 39:53.934
‐ YEP.
‐ WERE THEY MORONS?

39:53.934 --> 39:54.935
YEP.

39:56.607 --> 39:58.108
YOU OKAY?

40:02.022 --> 40:03.023
YEP.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.616
BE SAFE GETTING HOME.

40:56.166 --> 40:57.958
HELLO?

42:08.408 --> 42:10.410
Man on TV:
<i>The entire area,
and that means</i>

42:10.410 --> 42:12.613
<i>more sunny skies
and warm temperatures...</i>

42:12.613 --> 42:14.414
‐ <i>( door opens )
</i> ‐ ( continues speaking )

42:32.222 --> 42:34.224
<i>( TV shuts off )</i>

42:35.976 --> 42:37.437
MAY I ASK WHAT
YOU'RE DOING?

42:37.437 --> 42:40.270
I'M DECANTING
SOME WINE, FANNY.

42:41.271 --> 42:42.733
AND WHEN I'M DONE,

42:42.733 --> 42:44.985
I'M GOING TO POUR
TWO GLASSES,

42:44.985 --> 42:46.857
AND THEN I'M
GOING TO EXPLAIN

42:46.857 --> 42:48.989
HOW I THINK ALL THIS

42:48.989 --> 42:51.451
‐ IS GOING TO WORK.
‐ OH, REALLY?

42:51.451 --> 42:52.533
YES.

42:52.533 --> 42:53.864
SHOULD I START
PACKING?

42:53.864 --> 42:55.195
THIS IS
YOUR HOME, FANNY.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.748
HUBBELL WOULDN'T WANT
YOU TO EVER FEEL

42:57.748 --> 42:59.660
THAT IS ISN'T.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.291
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO STAY HERE

43:01.291 --> 43:03.463
IN THIS HOUSE
THAT YOU LOVE,

43:03.463 --> 43:05.796
AND I'M GOING TO MOVE
INTO THE GUEST HOUSE

43:05.796 --> 43:08.509
BEHIND THE STUDIO.

43:08.509 --> 43:09.550
AND THEN WHAT?

43:09.550 --> 43:11.211
THAT'S ALL
I GOT SO FAR.

43:11.211 --> 43:13.173
NOT MUCH OF A PLAN.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.635
ALL I KNOW

43:14.635 --> 43:16.557
IS THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO LIVE HERE

43:16.557 --> 43:18.679
AND I'M GOING
TO LIVE THERE,

43:18.679 --> 43:19.890
AND TONIGHT

43:19.890 --> 43:21.351
WE ARE GOING
TO GET VERY,

43:21.351 --> 43:23.023
VERY DRUNK.

43:30.779 --> 43:32.571
HOW LONG IS THAT
GOING TO TAKE?

43:32.571 --> 43:35.124
A VERY...

43:35.124 --> 43:37.706
VERY...

43:37.706 --> 43:39.538
LONG...

43:41.580 --> 43:42.922
TIME.
