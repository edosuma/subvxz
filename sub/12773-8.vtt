<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:02.213 --> 00:04.939
Graydal Securities is the one
behind the beast bounty.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.866
So that's where I'm going next.

00:07.867 --> 00:10.898
Graydal is not just
your everyday security firm.

00:10.998 --> 00:12.666
They're like Blackwater

00:12.700 --> 00:15.936
on steroids. They're not gonna
just let you walk in there

00:15.970 --> 00:17.470
to get a job.
- Yeah.

00:17.505 --> 00:18.839
I got to get
on the inside, right?

00:22.877 --> 00:24.678
(grunts)

00:24.712 --> 00:27.514
I'm here to see his boss.

00:27.548 --> 00:29.482
DHS is everywhere
looking for you.

00:29.517 --> 00:31.484
You killed the deputy secretary.

00:31.519 --> 00:32.686
You want to hand yourself over

00:32.720 --> 00:34.120
to the people who
are hunting you?

00:34.155 --> 00:35.121
They got no idea
I'm the beast

00:35.156 --> 00:36.122
they're looking for.

00:36.157 --> 00:37.490
We keep getting in deeper,

00:37.525 --> 00:39.025
Vincent, it keeps
getting riskier.

00:39.060 --> 00:41.361
When does this
ever end?

00:41.395 --> 00:44.497
DHS-- they trust you, and
now, when Graydal finds out

00:44.532 --> 00:48.335
that you betrayed me, then
they will trust me, too.

00:48.369 --> 00:50.704
Come on, it's fine--
we're both in.

00:50.738 --> 00:53.039
Yeah, on opposite sides
of the law.

01:06.787 --> 01:08.788
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

01:09.451 --> 01:11.126
I'm gonna call you back.
Sorry, I got to go.

01:11.127 --> 01:14.735
Everywhere I go, people
are whispering behind my back.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.705
DHS, Il Cantuccio, here--

01:17.740 --> 01:19.107
it is driving me crazy.

01:19.141 --> 01:20.108
It'll get better soon.

01:20.142 --> 01:21.776
Will it? How will it get better?

01:21.810 --> 01:23.244
I don't know actually,
I didn't really have

01:23.278 --> 01:24.712
anything else planned
to say after that.

01:24.747 --> 01:26.414
And you--
I don't want to hear you say

01:26.448 --> 01:27.782
"I told you so" right now.

01:27.816 --> 01:29.056
That's not
what I was gonna say.

01:29.852 --> 01:31.719
Well, look, you and Vincent

01:31.754 --> 01:32.787
made a decision, right?

01:32.821 --> 01:34.088
You knew that your plan for him

01:34.123 --> 01:35.423
to infiltrate Graydal
and for you

01:35.457 --> 01:37.058
to keep DHS away
from him was risky,

01:37.092 --> 01:39.961
but you did it anyway. And
so now you got to live with it.

01:39.995 --> 01:41.662
Jeez.
Way to calm her down, Tess.

01:41.697 --> 01:44.298
W... There's nothing
to calm down, Heather,

01:44.333 --> 01:46.334
Cat knows that. That's why
you wanted to meet, right--

01:46.368 --> 01:48.102
for us to help you?

01:48.137 --> 01:50.104
It's been a week. I
haven't heard from him.

01:50.139 --> 01:52.440
JT hasn't found him either, and
he's monitoring everything.

01:52.474 --> 01:53.574
You're worried?

01:53.609 --> 01:56.444
Of course I'm worried. I mean,

01:56.478 --> 01:58.679
he's undercover in a den
of thieves trying to get

01:58.714 --> 02:00.782
on a mission so that he can
figure out who's after a beast,

02:00.816 --> 02:03.317
with DHS after <i>him.</i>
<i>And I-- I don't know</i>

02:03.352 --> 02:04.886
how close DHS is
to finding him

02:04.920 --> 02:06.687
because they're
shutting me out.

02:06.722 --> 02:08.923
But wait, I thought the whole
point of this charade last week

02:08.957 --> 02:11.426
was so DHS thought you were
willing to betray Vincent?

02:11.460 --> 02:13.861
Yes, it was, and it did.

02:13.896 --> 02:16.664
But now they have brought in
a new heavy hitter

02:16.698 --> 02:19.700
to take over the manhunt
and I can't get her to trust me.

02:19.735 --> 02:22.537
And that makes me feel so...
(intercom beeps)

02:22.571 --> 02:25.406
WOMAN: Sorry, Captain, but A.D.A. Ellis
says he just wanted to know

02:25.441 --> 02:26.908
if you're still on
for drinks tonight?

02:26.942 --> 02:29.343
Uh, yeah, yes.
Thank you.

02:29.378 --> 02:30.845
Drinks?

02:30.879 --> 02:32.880
Wait, are you dating again?

02:32.915 --> 02:35.950
Anyway. Continue, please.

02:35.984 --> 02:37.919
I hate being away
from Vincent for so long,

02:37.953 --> 02:40.688
not just because I miss him
or because I can't figure out

02:40.722 --> 02:43.224
how to work the TV
because he changed the remote.

02:43.258 --> 02:44.255
Well, JT can help you with that.

02:44.279 --> 02:46.712
Forget JT.
And, you, forget about

02:46.728 --> 02:48.362
people whispering, there's
nothing you can do

02:48.397 --> 02:50.198
about that anyway.
You need to focus,

02:50.232 --> 02:52.700
because the sooner you can get
back on the inside with DHS,

02:52.734 --> 02:54.869
the sooner you can figure out
how to exonerate Vincent

02:54.903 --> 02:55.846
and get out of this mess.

02:55.870 --> 02:57.291
And get your happily
ever after back.

02:57.292 --> 02:58.998
Yeah, what does that mean? I
don't even know what that means.

02:59.022 --> 03:00.408
Well, I don't know, don't

03:00.409 --> 03:01.509
look at me, you're the one who
keeps saying it.

03:01.543 --> 03:04.111
(sighs) Okay. Well...

03:04.146 --> 03:06.948
forget a happily ever after,

03:06.982 --> 03:10.685
I will just be happy
to have Vincent back alive.

03:14.056 --> 03:15.623
(grunting)

03:23.232 --> 03:24.465
What do I have to do

03:24.500 --> 03:26.300
to prove to you

03:26.335 --> 03:28.369
that you can trust me, huh?

03:28.403 --> 03:29.403
Aah!

03:31.173 --> 03:33.174
Kill someone?

03:33.208 --> 03:34.542
Maybe.

03:34.576 --> 03:35.810
Nathanson--

03:35.844 --> 03:37.211
you're up.

03:37.246 --> 03:39.313
(grunting)

03:40.516 --> 03:42.383
(low growl)

03:46.255 --> 03:48.456
(groaning)

03:53.061 --> 03:55.596
I thought you said you were over
your wife betraying you.

03:55.631 --> 03:57.398
Oh, believe me, I am.

03:57.432 --> 03:59.500
Are you? You got to get

03:59.535 --> 04:01.068
your emotions in check
before I put you

04:01.103 --> 04:03.971
out in the field, Keller.
I can't risk it.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.907
What the hell
am I even doing here?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.308
Other than ducking DHS,
you mean?

04:07.342 --> 04:10.244
Nathanson.

04:10.279 --> 04:12.146
Be ready. 0600 hours.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.514
Y-You're choosing him?

04:13.549 --> 04:15.783
I just kicked his ass.
Want to try again?

04:15.817 --> 04:17.851
Nathanson.

04:17.886 --> 04:19.620
Go.

04:21.290 --> 04:25.092
Now.

04:25.127 --> 04:26.594
And you--

04:26.628 --> 04:28.663
get your head
straight.

04:28.697 --> 04:31.766
I don't need some jilted hothead
screwing up my operations.

04:40.142 --> 04:42.343
You trust him?

04:42.377 --> 04:44.845
I don't know.
- Mm.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.884
WOMAN: All right, everybody,
let's clear out.

04:49.918 --> 04:51.786
You're making a mistake.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.355
I can't help bring Vincent in
if you keep me on the sidelines.

04:54.389 --> 04:56.357
Now is not the time, Chandler.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.561
Graydal Securities.

05:00.596 --> 05:01.528
You think Vincent's
working for them now?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.264
Maybe.

05:03.265 --> 05:04.762
But-but why?
What's he doing there?

05:04.786 --> 05:05.900
I don't know.

05:05.901 --> 05:08.469
Maybe it's just a safe haven,
maybe something else.

05:08.503 --> 05:09.804
Well, if they put him
on a mission, that might be

05:09.838 --> 05:10.805
our best
chance of catching him.

05:10.839 --> 05:12.640
That's the hope.

05:12.674 --> 05:14.141
I should've been in that meeting

05:14.176 --> 05:15.643
so I know what's going on.
I can help.

05:15.677 --> 05:17.078
Agent Morgan understood--
Yeah, Agent Morgan

05:17.112 --> 05:19.447
let you call the shots.
That's over.

05:19.481 --> 05:21.048
You should never
have been anywhere

05:21.083 --> 05:23.084
near that sting
when we lost Keller.

05:23.118 --> 05:25.720
All due respect, Agent Dylan,
but you weren't there.

05:25.754 --> 05:27.788
I tried to help
reason with Vincent.

05:27.823 --> 05:29.056
I tried to bring him in.

05:29.091 --> 05:30.057
That wasn't the time to reason.

05:30.092 --> 05:31.559
It was the time to take action.

05:31.593 --> 05:33.761
You were too emotional.
You weren't fit

05:33.795 --> 05:35.696
to negotiate Keller's surrender.

05:37.699 --> 05:39.100
No, you're right.

05:39.134 --> 05:43.037
I didn't say or do
enough to bring him in.

05:43.071 --> 05:47.041
I wasn't ready.
But I am now.

05:47.075 --> 05:48.709
Is that why you're still
wearing your wedding ring?

05:48.744 --> 05:51.912
I'm not gonna try to convince
you that I don't

05:51.947 --> 05:53.948
still care about
him, because I do.

05:53.982 --> 05:56.517
Then I don't have to explain
why I can't have you involved.

05:56.551 --> 06:00.054
I need to put him in prison,
not back in your bed.

06:00.088 --> 06:02.757
I don't-I don't need him
back in my bed, I just...

06:02.791 --> 06:04.291
I want him back alive.

06:04.326 --> 06:08.262
Vincent ran, that makes him
look guilty, I get that.

06:08.296 --> 06:11.632
But I know him-- he is gonna do
anything and everything he can

06:11.667 --> 06:14.869
to prove his innocence, even if
that means working with Graydal.

06:14.903 --> 06:17.705
But the longer this goes on,

06:17.739 --> 06:20.174
the more he's risking his life.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.343
And I will do anything

06:22.377 --> 06:24.345
and everything I can to save it.

06:34.423 --> 06:35.623
Hey.

06:35.657 --> 06:38.693
Heather.
What are you doing here?

06:40.929 --> 06:42.697
Wait, is Cat all right?

06:42.731 --> 06:45.566
Cat? Yeah, sure. Well, unless
you count the fact that

06:45.600 --> 06:47.501
there's a massive, secret
manhunt out for her husband.

06:47.536 --> 06:49.870
It is so
hard on her.

06:49.905 --> 06:51.138
She misses Vincent
terribly and, frankly,

06:51.173 --> 06:52.406
she's a wreck without him.

06:52.441 --> 06:54.742
Yeah. I can understand that.

06:54.776 --> 06:56.977
Really?
'Cause you miss Tess?

06:57.012 --> 06:58.179
What?

06:59.548 --> 07:01.782
No. I meant...

07:01.817 --> 07:04.285
I can understand
how hard it must be for them.

07:04.319 --> 07:05.820
Mm.
You know, being separated,

07:05.854 --> 07:08.556
not being able to work
together for so long.

07:08.590 --> 07:12.760
Perfect couples
don't stay perfect apart.

07:12.794 --> 07:14.161
Right.

07:14.196 --> 07:16.397
By the way,

07:16.431 --> 07:17.932
do you know
that Tess is dating?

07:17.966 --> 07:19.133
What?

07:20.869 --> 07:22.069
She is? Uh, are you sure?

07:22.104 --> 07:23.137
Yeah.

07:23.171 --> 07:25.506
Drinks with an A.D.A.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.108
Look, I'm not meddling,
I'm just saying,

07:27.142 --> 07:28.309
unless you want
to stay apart

07:28.343 --> 07:29.410
from your girl
permanently...

07:29.444 --> 07:30.811
She's not my girl anymore.

07:32.714 --> 07:34.081
At least not until
I can figure out

07:34.116 --> 07:35.249
what the hell
I'm doing with my life.

07:35.283 --> 07:36.317
Well, maybe you could, like,

07:36.351 --> 07:37.518
speed it up a little bit.

07:37.552 --> 07:39.186
Meddling.

07:39.221 --> 07:41.555
Okay, fine. Leaving.

07:44.626 --> 07:47.010
Hello.
JT, it's me.

07:47.011 --> 07:48.943
Where have you been? I've been
looking all over for you.

07:48.944 --> 07:50.999
Yeah, but you haven't been able to
find me, right?

07:51.032 --> 07:52.266
Right, no, and I've been
tapping into

07:52.300 --> 07:53.968
everything I can tap into.

07:54.002 --> 07:55.436
That's good. If you
can't find me, nobody can.

07:55.470 --> 07:58.038
No, that's bad.

07:58.073 --> 08:00.141
How're we supposed to watch your
back if we can't even see it?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.942
Just keep trying, okay?
The last thing I want

08:01.977 --> 08:03.844
is DHS taking you down with me.

08:03.879 --> 08:05.946
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:05.981 --> 08:07.581
How's she doing, buddy?

08:07.616 --> 08:09.116
Missing you.

08:09.151 --> 08:10.584
A lot.

08:10.619 --> 08:12.620
No more than I'm missing her.

08:12.654 --> 08:14.889
I-I got to solve this, JT.

08:14.923 --> 08:17.191
I got to figure out
who's behind this bounty,

08:17.225 --> 08:19.627
prove I'm innocent soon, man,
or I'm gonna go crazy.

08:19.661 --> 08:21.462
You know,
I can't even sleep at night

08:21.496 --> 08:23.097
without her,
let alone think straight.

08:23.131 --> 08:25.466
Yeah, I sort of know
how you feel.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.135
So where are you?

08:28.170 --> 08:30.304
Uh, Meatpacking District,

08:30.338 --> 08:33.307
14th near Washington.

08:33.341 --> 08:35.376
Look, let Tess know
that I need her

08:35.409 --> 08:36.977
to pick up a package
from here, all right?

08:37.011 --> 08:38.578
Package? What kind of package?

08:38.613 --> 08:41.582
His name is Nathanson,
he's a Graydal merc.

08:41.616 --> 08:43.082
Tell her to arrest him
on drunk and disorderly,

08:43.118 --> 08:44.652
hold him and then question him,

08:44.686 --> 08:46.587
see if she can find out
what type of mission he was on.

08:46.621 --> 08:48.622
I don't understand.
I don't have time to explain

08:48.657 --> 08:50.457
right now, all right?

08:50.492 --> 08:53.160
But if I'm right, then
I'll be on his mission soon.

08:53.195 --> 08:54.762
Got it. Uh, need anything else?

08:54.796 --> 08:57.164
Yeah, one more thing.

08:57.199 --> 08:59.433
I need to see Catherine.

09:05.407 --> 09:07.508
Are you sure this is safe?

09:07.542 --> 09:09.710
I mean, obviously,
I want to see Vincent

09:09.744 --> 09:11.078
more than anything, but...

back to me.

activity in the area, it's safe.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.488
Yeah, but it isn't DHS
just monitoring

A <i>lot</i> more power.

12:05.076 --> 12:08.879

To talk to Tess,

Didn't answer
my question.

18:31.337 --> 18:33.805
is ultra high-tech--
it only allows in people it recognizes.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.640
Their watches
act as fobs,

18:35.675 --> 18:37.976
which is why we have
to switch them out

18:38.010 --> 18:39.611
if we're going to get in.

18:39.645 --> 18:42.247
Get in to do what, exactly?

18:42.281 --> 18:43.782
(chuckles):
Oh. Nice try.

18:43.816 --> 18:45.550
Shall we?

18:50.456 --> 18:52.290
DYLAN:
<i>All right, everybody,</i>

18:52.325 --> 18:54.659
park and gear up.
No DHS jackets.

18:54.694 --> 18:55.894
I don't want to make a scene.

18:55.928 --> 18:56.962
SWAT, stand by on the perimeter,

18:56.996 --> 18:58.230
wait for my command.
- Dylan.

18:58.264 --> 18:59.531
Chandler, what are
you doing here?

18:59.565 --> 19:01.967
Why wasn't I informed?
I thought you trusted me.

19:02.001 --> 19:03.535
How did you find out
about this anyway?

19:03.569 --> 19:06.671
The same way you did,
I'm assuming: that Graydal op.

19:06.706 --> 19:09.341
Is Vincent here?
Yes, but...

19:09.375 --> 19:12.010
If you want to get him out of here
without causing a scene, or worse,

19:12.044 --> 19:14.980
alerting the press, I'm your best shot,
and you know it.

19:15.014 --> 19:16.114
Please, I want to help.

19:17.216 --> 19:18.450
All right.

19:19.519 --> 19:20.852
You're with me.

19:22.255 --> 19:24.723
Mr. Lewis,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

19:24.757 --> 19:26.424
Pleasure's all mine,

19:26.459 --> 19:27.559
Mrs., uh...?

19:27.593 --> 19:28.894
Vanderbilt.

19:28.928 --> 19:30.061
Linda Vanderbilt.

19:30.096 --> 19:32.697
Vanderbilt?
Are you related to...

19:32.732 --> 19:34.432
Actually, I am.
I just don't like

19:34.467 --> 19:36.001
to admit it
to everybody.

19:36.035 --> 19:38.537
Seems someone's always after me
for something these days.

19:38.571 --> 19:40.605
LEWIS (laughs):
Tell me about it,

19:40.640 --> 19:41.406
uh...?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.507
Oh. Keith.

19:42.542 --> 19:43.608
Franklin.

19:43.643 --> 19:44.643
Pleasure.

19:49.248 --> 19:52.417
Have you visited our
silent auction yet?

19:52.451 --> 19:53.752
Um...

19:53.786 --> 19:54.753
no, we...

19:54.787 --> 19:55.954
we haven't.
Where is it?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.055
Follow me.

19:57.089 --> 19:59.624
(chuckles)

19:59.659 --> 20:00.892
Good luck, honey.

20:00.927 --> 20:03.595
Great to
meet you.

20:05.965 --> 20:07.098
Oh, no.

20:09.802 --> 20:11.203
(indistinct chatter)

20:11.237 --> 20:13.071
Excuse me, ladies!
- Hey.

20:16.275 --> 20:18.443
(gasps)
What the hell

20:18.477 --> 20:20.145
are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?

20:20.179 --> 20:21.246
What am I doing here?
I'm trying to figure out

20:21.280 --> 20:22.547
what the hell you're doing here.

20:22.582 --> 20:23.715
Is DHS here?
- Yes.

20:23.749 --> 20:24.983
Your Graydal friend
ratted you out.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.151
Great plan, by the way,

20:26.185 --> 20:27.452
sending him to Tess
for information.

20:27.486 --> 20:28.453
It worked out really well,

20:28.487 --> 20:29.754
for DHS.
- Okay, well,

20:29.789 --> 20:31.256
I was trying to figure out a way
to let you know

20:31.290 --> 20:32.490
where I was
so you could cover for me,

20:32.525 --> 20:33.765
which, by the way, you're doing

20:33.793 --> 20:35.327
a terrible job of right now.

20:35.361 --> 20:36.995
Terrible job? The only reason
Yes.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.631
you're not in Guantanamo
right now is because of me.

20:39.665 --> 20:41.585
I am the reason that DHS
isn't storming this place.

20:41.609 --> 20:42.601
All right, all right.

20:42.602 --> 20:44.737
Let's just calm down. We got
to figure this out right now.

20:44.761 --> 20:45.604
Figure it out?

20:45.605 --> 20:47.606
Vincent, you have got to get out
of here now.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.940
I can't leave without my wife.

20:49.842 --> 20:51.743
I mean... I mean Diane.

20:51.777 --> 20:53.678
Okay, it's just... it's
just for the mission.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.280
We're undercover. That's all.

20:55.314 --> 20:57.048
Yeah,
is that what that kiss was?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.083
What?

20:58.117 --> 20:59.417
Never mind. Off topic.

20:59.452 --> 21:00.752
Come here.

21:00.786 --> 21:02.621
What are you doing?

21:02.675 --> 21:03.278
I'm trying to kiss you.

21:03.302 --> 21:05.302
Just in case I never,
ever get to do it again.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.059
Stop talking like that. I am
going to get you out of here.

21:08.094 --> 21:10.395
Even if you can, Diane's gonna
get suspicious, and then I'm gonna lose

21:10.429 --> 21:11.896
my only chance of getting
deeper into Graydal.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.618
On the other hand,
if DHS catches you,

21:13.642 --> 21:15.533
you're gonna go to jail,
and I'm not gonna get a chance

21:15.534 --> 21:18.036
to get deeper into DHS
to prove your innocence.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.404
Okay. Whose idea was this again?

21:19.438 --> 21:21.273
Yours.
All right.

21:21.307 --> 21:22.674
We-we can't keep doing this.

21:22.708 --> 21:25.043
I don't do so
well without you.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.045
We don't do so well without
each other, Vincent. That's...

21:27.079 --> 21:30.282
the problem, both professionally
and personally.

21:30.316 --> 21:32.384
But we do have to figure
this out, because, frankly,

21:32.418 --> 21:35.220
this isn't the way we're gonna
get our happily ever after back.

21:35.254 --> 21:39.124
Um, out of curiosity,
is Diane the kind of person

21:39.158 --> 21:40.725
to surrender
peacefully?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.460
Uh-oh. No. No, she'll kill her.

21:42.495 --> 21:44.462
Great. Okay, well,
I'm gonna go save my new boss

21:44.497 --> 21:45.530
from your new wife.

21:45.564 --> 21:47.532
It was for the mission!

21:47.566 --> 21:49.634
(sighs)
Damn it.

21:49.669 --> 21:51.636
I know Keller's here.
Where is he?

21:51.671 --> 21:54.139
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:54.173 --> 21:56.308
I'm talking about aiding and
abetting, but if you don't...

21:56.342 --> 21:58.610
(grunting)
(bystanders gasping, chattering)

22:03.382 --> 22:04.883
(grunting)
(gunshot)

22:04.917 --> 22:07.185
(bystanders shouting)

22:09.155 --> 22:12.357
Oh. You're the wife.

22:12.391 --> 22:13.992
We're divorcing. It's messy.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.194
(shouts)

22:16.228 --> 22:18.830
You got the watch?

22:18.864 --> 22:19.673
Yeah, they're here.

22:19.697 --> 22:21.697
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.

22:31.152 --> 22:33.787
We barely made it out of there.
His wife showed up.

22:33.822 --> 22:36.657
Oh, yeah. Forget to mention that
I'm the one who saved you from her.

22:36.691 --> 22:37.691
I didn't need saving.

22:37.725 --> 22:38.692
The hell you didn't.

22:38.726 --> 22:39.693
I knocked her
out.

22:39.727 --> 22:40.994
That's how we escaped.

22:41.029 --> 22:42.329
You knocked her into a pool.

22:42.363 --> 22:43.630
Why was she even there?
Because she was

22:43.665 --> 22:45.365
hunting me down.
Why do you think?

22:45.400 --> 22:46.700
I think that's a hell
of a coincidence,

22:46.734 --> 22:48.101
and I don't believe
in coincidences.

22:48.136 --> 22:49.503
Okay, I think you two
are starting

22:49.537 --> 22:51.071
to sound
like a real married couple.

22:53.141 --> 22:54.441
Did you get the watches?

22:54.475 --> 22:55.676
Yes, sir.
They're here.

22:55.710 --> 22:57.244
Think the mission's compromised?

22:57.278 --> 22:58.912
I'm not sure.
- No.

22:58.947 --> 23:00.914
They got no idea
we're after them.

23:00.949 --> 23:03.217
By the way,
why were we after them?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.885
You ask a lot
of questions.

23:04.919 --> 23:07.087
Yeah, because I'm sick
of being kept in the dark.

23:07.121 --> 23:08.755
Look, Dawes,

23:08.790 --> 23:11.058
I understand that you
don't trust me. That's fine.

23:11.092 --> 23:13.060
But, after this, either
you put me on a real mission,

23:13.094 --> 23:15.867
the kind that makes
real money, or I'm out.

23:15.868 --> 23:16.877
Out?

23:16.998 --> 23:18.298
Where do you think
you're gonna go?

23:18.333 --> 23:19.766
You came to us 'cause DHS

23:19.801 --> 23:21.535
is after you.
And you took me on

23:21.569 --> 23:23.470
because I'm valuable to you.

23:23.504 --> 23:26.139
But if I'm just stealing watches
and putting up with her,

23:26.174 --> 23:27.908
forget it. How 'bout
we be straight, okay?

23:27.942 --> 23:30.644
DHS is getting closer,
which means

23:30.678 --> 23:32.646
I got to make enough
to disappear and fast.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.448
You get it?

23:40.154 --> 23:43.490
Why is Braxton even taking
the risk with him? Why bother?

23:43.524 --> 23:45.726
He likes operatives
who have a lot to lose.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.362
Gives them an edge.
Just like you.

23:49.464 --> 23:51.431
Keller did help me escape,

23:51.466 --> 23:54.501
so he can't be a DHS plant.

23:54.535 --> 23:56.703
But he kisses
like a married man.

23:56.738 --> 23:58.739
Then you need to figure out
if we can trust him

23:58.773 --> 24:00.707
one way or another.

24:07.615 --> 24:09.983
(indistinct chatter)

24:14.856 --> 24:16.823
How you feeling?

24:16.858 --> 24:18.792
Like I've been
hit by a truck.

24:21.229 --> 24:22.930
I heard you saved my life.

24:22.964 --> 24:25.399
It was the least I could do.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.034
It's not your fault, Chandler.

24:28.303 --> 24:29.703
It's your husband's.

24:29.737 --> 24:32.940
You're not responsible
for his actions.

24:32.974 --> 24:35.442
I guess it's time I really
started trusting you though.

24:35.476 --> 24:38.078
Especially seeing as how I'm
gonna be laid up for a while.

24:38.112 --> 24:40.580
I'm gonna need you
to keep pushing ahead,

24:40.615 --> 24:43.617
enough for
both of us.

24:43.651 --> 24:46.286
Intelligence ID'd the woman.

24:46.321 --> 24:49.423
Her name's Diane Vaughn.

24:49.457 --> 24:51.058
Wanted by
Interpol

24:51.092 --> 24:53.527
on multiple murder charges.

24:53.561 --> 24:55.629
She's a hit man.
What?

24:55.663 --> 25:00.267
Seems your husband's working
for the darker side of Graydal.

25:00.301 --> 25:04.271
Not the best way to go about
trying to prove he's innocent.

25:04.305 --> 25:07.307
No, it's not.

25:07.342 --> 25:10.310
JT, we have to find Vincent
now. Things are getting out of control.

25:10.345 --> 25:12.646
Okay. I know. I'm on it. I'll
call you when I find something.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.615
Hey. I came as fast as I could.
What's wrong?

25:15.650 --> 25:17.150
Everything's wrong, still.

25:17.185 --> 25:19.152
Worse, actually, if
that's even possible.

25:19.187 --> 25:21.955
Uh, sit there. You're better
at social media than I am.

25:21.990 --> 25:23.690
Yeah. So?

25:23.725 --> 25:27.461
I programmed facial recognition
software into all user-generated

25:27.495 --> 25:29.563
content on the Web.
- Uh, JT...

25:29.597 --> 25:32.165
Okay, okay. Cat said Vincent

25:32.200 --> 25:34.801
and some bimbo assassin...
Bimbo assassin?

25:34.836 --> 25:36.570
Would you stop interrupting
and listen?

25:36.604 --> 25:38.171
Sorry.
They were almost

25:38.206 --> 25:39.806
caught
at some Lewis charity event

25:39.841 --> 25:41.308
on Long Island,
but, uh,

25:41.342 --> 25:43.310
Cat didn't know
what they were trying to do.

25:43.344 --> 25:44.760
And now Vincent's on the run,
which means...

25:44.784 --> 25:45.579
Again.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.547
Sorry. Continue.

25:47.582 --> 25:50.884
Which means, as usual,
we're playing catch-up.

25:50.918 --> 25:53.587
Now, I spotted them coming back
on the expressway,

25:53.621 --> 25:55.122
but we need to figure out

25:55.156 --> 25:57.624
exactly where they're
going before DHS does.

25:57.658 --> 25:59.226
Got him.

25:59.260 --> 26:01.228
Already?
- Mm-hmm.

26:01.262 --> 26:02.729
Well, just at the
party, anyway.

26:02.764 --> 26:04.631
But somebody posted a
photo of the Lewises.

26:04.665 --> 26:06.345
Do you recognize anybody
in the background?

26:07.869 --> 26:09.836
Good. Uh,
keep checking posts.

26:09.871 --> 26:12.272
Anything and everything
connected to the Lewises.

26:12.306 --> 26:14.174
Because whatever mission
Vincent's on,

26:14.208 --> 26:16.510
it's got to have something to do
with them. I'll keep checking

26:16.544 --> 26:21.848
surveillance, drones,
and... cell towers.

26:21.883 --> 26:24.117
Vincent's lucky to have
a friend like you,

26:24.152 --> 26:26.787
you know that,
don't you?

26:26.821 --> 26:30.190
Yeah, well, he deserves
better than this.

26:30.224 --> 26:33.026
It's not fair this is
happening to him or to Cat.

26:33.061 --> 26:34.961
Yeah, well,

26:34.996 --> 26:37.597
who knows, maybe
after we get

26:37.632 --> 26:39.599
Vincent and Cat back together
again, we can start working

26:39.634 --> 26:40.834
on you and Tess...
- Stop.

26:40.868 --> 26:43.036
Okay, fine. Sorry.

26:43.071 --> 26:45.672
All I'm saying is
snooze, you lose.

26:50.044 --> 26:52.646
♪

26:54.916 --> 26:56.049
(trilling)

26:59.387 --> 27:03.123
FEMALE VOICE: Auto check complete.
House is secure.

27:03.157 --> 27:06.460
Welcome home,
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis.

27:06.494 --> 27:09.096
It's kind of creepy, huh?

27:09.130 --> 27:12.365
Safe's over there
behind the art piece.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.570
Right. Let's get this
over with then.

27:16.604 --> 27:18.638
I don't suppose you're gonna

27:18.673 --> 27:20.640
tell me what's in this thing,
what we're looking for.

27:20.675 --> 27:22.442
All I know is
it's a flash drive.

27:22.477 --> 27:24.878
All I care is I get paid.

27:24.912 --> 27:27.781
Well, glad we finally
agree on something.

27:27.815 --> 27:29.216
(beeping)

27:29.250 --> 27:31.618
Open it.

27:37.625 --> 27:38.625
Got it.

27:39.927 --> 27:42.295
All right, let's
get out of here.

27:46.434 --> 27:48.368
What are you
waiting for?

27:50.638 --> 27:52.506
Freeze! Don't move.

27:52.540 --> 27:55.542
That's what we're waiting for.

27:57.712 --> 28:00.080
A silent alarm. Where?

28:00.114 --> 28:01.982
Checking.
5 Gatsby Drive in Great Neck.

28:02.016 --> 28:04.489
5 Gatsby Drive.
That's the Lewises' home.

28:04.490 --> 28:05.778
The Lewises? What,
are they robbing the place?

28:05.802 --> 28:06.858
It's got to be more than that.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.434
Okay. Are you sure
that it's Vincent?

28:08.458 --> 28:08.955
A friend just posted

28:08.956 --> 28:11.525
that the Lewises aren't supposed
to be back until Sunday.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.027
And another has a photo of Mr.
Lewis still at the beach club.

28:14.061 --> 28:16.897
That and the surveillance camera
out front just went inop.

28:16.931 --> 28:18.131
Does DHS know?
Not yet.

28:19.133 --> 28:20.600
(engine revving)

28:20.635 --> 28:21.501
(grunting)

28:21.536 --> 28:23.570
(groaning)

28:26.541 --> 28:29.512
All right. You want to tell me
why you set the alarm off?

28:29.513 --> 28:31.129
'Cause I needed to test
your loyalties,

28:31.153 --> 28:32.726
see if we can really
trust you or not.

28:33.214 --> 28:34.714
And how does this prove that?

28:34.749 --> 28:36.116
It proves it if you kill him.

28:36.150 --> 28:38.051
If you don't, I kill you.

28:39.487 --> 28:40.587
(groans)

28:46.199 --> 28:48.674
Alright, this is crazy.
We got what we wanted.

28:48.774 --> 28:50.108
Let's just get out of here.

28:50.142 --> 28:51.876
We can't leave any witnesses,
can we?

28:51.911 --> 28:52.911
He saw us.

28:52.945 --> 28:53.578
I won't say anything, I...

28:53.612 --> 28:55.213
Shut up.

28:55.247 --> 28:56.839
You're a little sick,
aren't you?

28:56.840 --> 28:59.409
No, I'm loyal. Are you?

28:59.678 --> 29:00.584
I'm no killer.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.502
Mmm. Tell that
to the agent you killed.

29:02.714 --> 29:03.623
That was self-defense.

29:03.647 --> 29:05.082
Then why didn't you
turn yourself in?

29:05.083 --> 29:06.951
You know, there's something
that doesn't add up about you.

29:06.985 --> 29:10.154
I can't put my finger on it, but
there are a lot of questions,

29:10.188 --> 29:13.124
and, the way I see it, there's
only one way to answer them.

29:14.593 --> 29:16.561
(groans, coughs)

29:16.595 --> 29:19.030
All right.

29:20.766 --> 29:22.500
Get up.

29:22.534 --> 29:24.335
No, no, no. Wait, wait,
I said get up!

29:24.369 --> 29:28.039
wait, wait, no.
(grunts)

29:28.073 --> 29:30.875
(choking, grunting)

29:48.860 --> 29:50.428
Now can we go?

29:50.462 --> 29:51.829
Back up.

29:51.863 --> 29:55.232
Back up!

30:01.373 --> 30:03.374
(laughs)

30:03.408 --> 30:06.377
Well, looks like
I was wrong about you.

30:07.713 --> 30:09.914
(elevator bell dings)

30:09.948 --> 30:12.083
Go check that out.

30:12.117 --> 30:13.451
There might be
someone else.

30:13.485 --> 30:15.119
Go on, I'll
get rid of him.

30:15.153 --> 30:16.754
Come on, go.

30:16.788 --> 30:18.255
Come on. Hurry.

30:24.129 --> 30:26.130
(groans softly)

30:26.164 --> 30:27.698
(electrical whoosh)

30:27.733 --> 30:28.733
One more time.

30:30.302 --> 30:31.936
(gasps)
- (grunting)

30:31.970 --> 30:36.607
(grunting, kicking)

30:36.642 --> 30:38.709
(yelling)

30:38.744 --> 30:40.745
(electrical whoosh,
Vincent panting)

30:40.779 --> 30:43.748
(rhythmic grunting)

30:43.782 --> 30:46.717
(grunting, glass breaking)

30:46.752 --> 30:49.887
(grunting)
- (whimpering)

30:49.921 --> 30:51.622
No!

30:51.657 --> 30:53.491
(grunts)
- (loud grunting)

30:53.525 --> 30:55.960
Come on, damn it. Come on.

30:55.994 --> 30:57.828
(both grunting)

30:57.863 --> 30:59.163
(yelling, thudding)

30:59.197 --> 31:01.799
(gasps)

31:07.673 --> 31:09.807
(sighs)

31:09.841 --> 31:12.243
(coughing) It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right.

31:12.277 --> 31:13.377
I'm here, I'm here.
Just breathe.

31:13.412 --> 31:14.578
Just breathe. It's okay.

31:14.613 --> 31:15.646
It's okay. I'm gonna help you.

31:15.681 --> 31:17.248
Just breathe. Just breathe.

31:17.282 --> 31:19.250
Just relax. Just relax...
Hey, call 911, all right?

31:19.284 --> 31:21.919
I think they're already
on their way, along with DHS.

31:21.953 --> 31:23.387
Just take it easy, okay?

31:23.422 --> 31:25.990
Hey. You okay?

31:26.024 --> 31:27.892
Am I okay?
Are you kidding me, Vincent?

31:27.926 --> 31:29.860
I nearly got killed
by La Femme Nikita

31:29.895 --> 31:32.196
out there, and you're in here
doing God knows what.

31:32.230 --> 31:35.566
What are you doing?
I-I had to kill him.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.322
It's a long story, okay, but
I-I... I got to go. Please...

31:38.346 --> 31:39.303
No, no, no, you don't.

31:39.304 --> 31:40.512
Honey, if I don't
leave now, then...

31:40.536 --> 31:41.038
No.

31:41.039 --> 31:44.709
You are not leaving until we get
a few things straight first.

31:44.743 --> 31:47.344
(sirens blaring)

31:47.379 --> 31:49.947
We can not keep going on like this.
Yes, okay.

31:49.981 --> 31:53.117
No. I am used to crazy,
but this is bananas.

31:53.151 --> 31:54.485
I know. Yes.
We have got to communicate

31:54.519 --> 31:55.920
with each other better
because I can't keep

31:55.954 --> 31:58.122
chasing you around the state
covering your ass

31:58.156 --> 32:00.091
without knowing
what the hell is going on!

32:00.125 --> 32:02.226
(sirens blaring)

32:04.196 --> 32:07.098
Honey, I hear you, and you're
100% right, we absolutely

32:07.132 --> 32:08.466
have to communicate better,
but if I don't leave

32:08.500 --> 32:10.367
right now, and I get caught,

32:10.402 --> 32:12.002
there's gonna be nothing to
communicate. That makes sense.

32:12.037 --> 32:16.273
Right? I love you. Got to go.
Okay, wait.

32:16.308 --> 32:17.775
I'll cover for you. Go, blur.

32:17.809 --> 32:20.044
Okay. I love you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:20.078 --> 32:21.612
(whooshing)
- (sighs)

32:26.932 --> 32:29.636
(elevator bell dings)

32:34.842 --> 32:36.977
Come in.

32:37.011 --> 32:38.912
Shouldn't you still be
at the hospital?

32:38.947 --> 32:40.414
Probably.

32:40.448 --> 32:42.349
There's a lot
going on, obviously.

32:42.383 --> 32:45.052
Ah, you've been apprised.
Yes, I have.

32:45.086 --> 32:46.887
Boy, when I tell you
to push on without me,

32:46.921 --> 32:48.422
you don't mess around, do you?

32:48.456 --> 32:49.923
Sorry?

32:49.958 --> 32:52.593
Well, you jumped
on your leads, somehow

32:52.627 --> 32:55.128
found Keller,
took down an Interpol assassin,

32:55.163 --> 32:56.897
and saved a security guard.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.733
Well, my husband
saved the guard.

32:59.767 --> 33:02.336
Yeah, I know.
That's what the guard said, too.

33:02.370 --> 33:04.671
He also said
that your husband saved him

33:04.706 --> 33:06.406
after he tried to kill him.

33:07.976 --> 33:09.309
Any idea what that's all about?

33:09.344 --> 33:12.179
I don't know.

33:12.213 --> 33:15.515
But the important thing is,
he saved his life, right?

33:15.550 --> 33:17.084
Yeah.

33:17.118 --> 33:19.853
Still, it's a curious
damn thing to do.

33:19.887 --> 33:22.990
Risking getting caught
to save somebody else.

33:23.024 --> 33:24.825
Look, just so we're clear,

33:24.859 --> 33:27.027
I don't care if your husband's
innocent or not.

33:27.061 --> 33:29.596
I only care about bringing
him in, do you understand?

33:29.631 --> 33:33.367
I understand, and I would have
if that Interpol assassin

33:33.401 --> 33:34.835
hadn't gotten
in my way.

33:34.869 --> 33:36.203
He must have just slipped out.

33:36.237 --> 33:38.505
Yeah, I know.

33:38.539 --> 33:41.642
Seeing as how you seem to have
a knack for tracking him down,

33:41.676 --> 33:44.011
I'm gonna make you the point
person on the investigation.

33:44.045 --> 33:45.445
You okay with that?

33:45.480 --> 33:47.214
Um... uh, yes.

33:47.248 --> 33:49.416
Yeah, of course, thank you.

33:49.450 --> 33:51.451
I won't let you down.

33:51.486 --> 33:53.120
Well, you better not,

33:53.154 --> 33:55.555
or I'll take you down
along with your husband.

34:13.507 --> 34:15.909
(door opening)

34:15.943 --> 34:19.545
Shut the door.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.014
(door closes)

34:25.520 --> 34:27.754
So what the hell happened?
I don't know.

34:27.789 --> 34:29.755
We got in, we got into the safe,

34:29.791 --> 34:32.592
then some guard shows up
out of nowhere.

34:32.627 --> 34:36.596
Hmm. Guess it must've been a
silent alarm or something, huh?

34:36.630 --> 34:39.166
What happened to Vaughn?

34:39.199 --> 34:43.603
Well... I guess
she met her match.

34:43.638 --> 34:46.005
God rest her soul.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.108
(glass breaking)

34:48.141 --> 34:51.011
You listen
to me, Keller.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.179
Don't you get glib with me.

34:53.214 --> 34:56.750
I just lost one of my
best operatives today,

34:56.784 --> 34:59.219
and I want to know
how the hell that happened.

34:59.253 --> 35:01.388
Like I said,
I don't know.

35:01.422 --> 35:04.991
All right, the guard showed, the
cops came, all hell broke loose.

35:05.026 --> 35:08.829
Besides, the mission wasn't
to get away with her, was it?

35:08.863 --> 35:12.799
The mission was
to get away with... this.

35:14.602 --> 35:17.337
Which I did,

35:17.371 --> 35:20.340
despite not being
trusted around here.

35:20.374 --> 35:22.275
Look,

35:22.310 --> 35:25.545
I'll be back
for my take tomorrow.

35:25.580 --> 35:29.015
But if you don't have something
better for me next time,

35:29.050 --> 35:32.719
consider this
my final mission.

35:32.754 --> 35:35.021
(door closes)

35:36.958 --> 35:40.393

35:43.231 --> 35:44.965

35:44.999 --> 35:49.703

35:49.737 --> 35:56.109

Tess? Hey!

36:12.326 --> 36:14.394
Hey. Uh, what are you...
what are you doing here?

36:14.428 --> 36:17.664
In case you forgot,
I come here a lot, you know.

36:17.698 --> 36:20.967
No, I know, I know, I just
didn't think you would, um...

36:21.002 --> 36:23.336
Why are you so dressed up?

36:23.371 --> 36:27.007
Me? Dressed up?

36:27.041 --> 36:30.143
Yeah, you don't do
leather, unless...

36:30.178 --> 36:32.746
You liar, you knew
I'd be here, didn't you?

36:32.780 --> 36:34.548
What, did you
call my office?

36:34.582 --> 36:36.883
No, don't be ridiculous.

36:38.886 --> 36:40.554
Okay, maybe.

36:40.588 --> 36:42.022
JT...
- Look, I know.

36:42.056 --> 36:43.857
I'm sorry,

36:43.891 --> 36:45.892
but everything
that's been going on

36:45.927 --> 36:48.762
with Cat and Vincent,
there hasn't been time.

36:48.796 --> 36:51.097
Time for what?

36:53.201 --> 36:55.569
Okay. Um...

36:55.603 --> 36:57.437
look, can we talk
about this another...?

36:57.471 --> 37:01.341
It's just... I know
we're not together anymore,

37:01.375 --> 37:06.313
and I probably don't have
any right to say this, but...

37:06.347 --> 37:09.916
I really don't want you
to start dating, okay?

37:09.951 --> 37:12.152
Oh, wow.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.820
I mean,

37:13.855 --> 37:16.423
I'm still trying
to find myself, I know,

37:16.457 --> 37:19.259
but... I'm getting closer,

37:19.293 --> 37:22.929
and... I still think
we have a chance if...

37:25.399 --> 37:27.601
Thanks.

37:30.404 --> 37:33.206
Right. Right.

37:33.241 --> 37:35.609
Such an idiot.

37:35.643 --> 37:37.177
No. JT, listen to me.
- No.

37:37.211 --> 37:38.812
It's okay. It's... my bad.

37:38.846 --> 37:41.548
I'm... sorry. Sorry. So sorry.

37:41.582 --> 37:43.984
No, JT, wait. Don't...

37:45.653 --> 37:48.388
(door bells tinkle)

37:50.892 --> 37:53.360
VINCENT: It doesn't matter
where we are, right,

37:53.394 --> 37:54.861
as long as we're together.

37:54.896 --> 37:57.464
No, it <i>does</i> matter
where we are.

37:57.498 --> 37:59.799
I want to be home
in our own bed.

37:59.834 --> 38:02.035
I know, I know. So do I.

38:02.069 --> 38:04.437
Okay, but this is
better than nothing,

38:04.472 --> 38:06.973
and nothing's
about all we had lately.

38:07.008 --> 38:08.775
True.

38:10.111 --> 38:12.078
Mmm.

38:12.113 --> 38:14.314
Hey.
- Mm.

38:14.348 --> 38:16.483
We have to talk about this.
No, no, no.

38:16.517 --> 38:17.951
Yes!
- Come on, later, later.

38:17.985 --> 38:19.920
No, mm, now. Now!
- Aah!

38:19.954 --> 38:21.888
Up.
- Okay.

38:21.923 --> 38:23.590
All right.

38:23.624 --> 38:25.926
(sighs)

38:25.960 --> 38:28.895
Okay, what'll we
do about this?

38:28.930 --> 38:31.464
I can't help thinking that
we're making the biggest mistake

38:31.499 --> 38:33.833
of our lives trying to
solve everything like this.

38:33.868 --> 38:35.969
Come on, we've been
through this.

38:36.003 --> 38:37.504
We didn't have a choice, right?

38:37.538 --> 38:40.440
Apart from me
turning myself in.

38:40.474 --> 38:43.510
But it's even too late for that now.
I know.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.998
But we can't do this
for much longer.

38:46.999 --> 38:50.534
This is the riskiest
thing that we've ever done.

38:50.569 --> 38:53.437
And I can't keep playing
catch-up with you,

38:53.472 --> 38:55.039
trying to protect you.

38:55.073 --> 38:57.108
I know, and I don't want you to.

38:57.142 --> 39:00.177
I don't, but it's like,
you know, like what you said

39:00.212 --> 39:02.680
when we came up
with this plan.

39:02.714 --> 39:05.349
Okay, like what I said.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.752
We got to figure out
a way of being together

39:07.786 --> 39:10.121
even when we...
when we can't be.

39:10.155 --> 39:11.922
Promise?

39:11.957 --> 39:14.859
Yes, I promise. Mmm.

39:14.893 --> 39:17.194
We have to check
in with each other

39:17.229 --> 39:19.697
on a regular
basis in person.

39:19.731 --> 39:22.299
Yes. Agreed. Mmm.

39:22.334 --> 39:25.202
Oh, and, and we
have to communicate,

39:25.237 --> 39:27.571
even if we can't
see each other.

39:27.606 --> 39:29.373
Yeah, of course.
Absolutely.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.409
Also, wait. You have
to teach me how

39:31.443 --> 39:33.778
to use the universal remote,
'cause I can't work the TV.

39:33.812 --> 39:36.113
No, that-that is, uh...

39:36.148 --> 39:37.462
I'm drawing the line
with the remote.

39:37.463 --> 39:39.848
I mean, come on, you're gonna
screw up my whole system.

39:39.849 --> 39:40.812
(laughs)

39:40.836 --> 39:42.786
That's a complete
deal breaker, I'm sorry.

39:42.954 --> 39:45.790
Okay, fine. Not the remote,
But, everything else...

39:45.824 --> 39:48.426
Oh, yes, everything else.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.795
And this.

39:52.330 --> 39:55.599
Definitely more of that.

39:55.634 --> 39:57.568
(laughing)
