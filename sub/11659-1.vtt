00:57.333 --> 00:59.367
Here, you can add this to the pile.

00:59.433 --> 01:03.033
You're not giving this dress
to the rummage sale?

01:03.100 --> 01:05.233
It's the best-looking outfit you own.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.633
You're right.
I still look damn good in this thing.

01:10.734 --> 01:12.633
I don't know about "damn good."

01:13.500 --> 01:16.834
That particular design
does tend to accentuate your behind

01:16.900 --> 01:19.700
while simultaneously
diminishing your cleavage.

01:21.300 --> 01:27.100
First you say this is my prettiest outfit,
then you say I don't look good in it.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.600
Which one's the truth?

01:28.667 --> 01:31.900
Both. But look on the bright side.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.533
How often do you get out of your robe
on weekends?

01:37.033 --> 01:40.867
-I finished loading the cartons.
-Thank you, Daisy, darling.

01:40.934 --> 01:45.000
You're very sweet
to help with this fund raiser.

01:45.066 --> 01:47.834
That's what being
a sunshine cadet is all about.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.934
I so admire your motto,
"spread it around."

01:52.900 --> 01:54.967
That's sunshine, Blanche.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.000
"Spread sunshine around."

01:59.100 --> 02:00.166
Whatever.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.166
Mrs. Nylund put some things
on her bed.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.333
-Please bring them here.
-Sure.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.700
Thank you.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.333
-Ma, where are you going?
-Down to the boardwalk.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.333
To watch the old guys rearrange themselves
when they come out of the water.

02:19.166 --> 02:22.000
-Where are you going?
-I'm off to the rummage sale.

02:22.066 --> 02:23.533
Would you like a ride?

02:23.900 --> 02:26.266
No. I want to do cartwheels
for 6 miles.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.667
Get your keys. Let's roll.

02:29.633 --> 02:33.166
-Here are Mrs. Nylund's things.
-Put them here. Thank you.

02:33.233 --> 02:35.700
I can't believe she's giving away
this teddy bear.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.734
-I wish I could afford him.
-You like him?

02:38.800 --> 02:41.734
I think he's the cutest thing.

02:41.800 --> 02:46.700
-Then I'm giving him to you. He's yours.
-Oh, thank you, Mrs. Devereaux!

02:46.767 --> 02:52.834
-Thank you! Thank you! Hi, Mrs. Nylund.
-Hi, Daisy. Bye, Daisy.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.533
That was Daisy, wasn't it?

02:54.600 --> 02:58.934
Yes. She's been helping
out the entire time you've been gone.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.033
It's inspiring the way
those sunshine cadets

03:02.100 --> 03:03.967
volunteer for community service.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.333
You know, back home, we didn't have
a community organization for females.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.967
Unless you count miss Maggie's house
on the hill.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.200
Those girls would stand
on their heads for you.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.934
But I heard that cost you 10 bucks extra.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.867
Blanche, have you seen
my teddy bear, Fernando?

03:24.934 --> 03:26.266
He's missing!

03:26.333 --> 03:30.834
I've had him since I was 6 years old.
I have to find him. I just have to.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.633
-Calm down, honey. He's just a toy.
-Fernando is not just a toy.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.400
He's a family heirloom.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.867
I've had him forever.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

03:40.934 --> 03:45.500
Rose, don't panic. We'll find him.
We just need a plan.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.000
You check the attic.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.700
I'll look outside in case
he wandered off.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.834
Good. I feel better now.
At least we have a plan.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.500
Someone sitting here?

04:10.133 --> 04:11.934
Cataracts or glaucoma?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.867
-I was just being polite.
-If you say so.

04:16.367 --> 04:18.834
Me, I've got both.
Cataracts and glaucoma.

04:18.900 --> 04:21.133
Glaucoma I handle with drops.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.533
-For cataracts, I had surgery.
-They used laser beams on me.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.800
-Zap! No more cataracts.
-Dynamite.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.967
You black?

04:32.900 --> 04:34.400
Laser beams, huh?

04:34.767 --> 04:37.567
Give me a break, you old geezer.
The sun's reflecting off the sand.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.333
Old geezer?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.567
What am I, Kreskin?
I don't know your name.

04:42.834 --> 04:47.500
If you didn't have your eyes zapped,
you could read it off my badge here.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.033
-"Alvin Newcastle, security guard."
-That's right.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.033
You should've bought one that says,
"Marshal, dodge city."

04:56.400 --> 04:58.066
This happens to be a legitimate,

04:58.133 --> 05:01.100
officially authorized
identification badge,

05:01.166 --> 05:03.900
issued by the police department direct.

05:04.166 --> 05:08.467
And I happen to be a legitimate,
for real security guard.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.433
Well, you're doing a great job.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.033
Nobody stole the boardwalk
since you've been sitting here.

05:15.066 --> 05:18.400
Forget it.
It's my fault for being friendly.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.000
I'll go back to counting sea gulls.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.633
Where do you work,
bank, department store?

05:24.700 --> 05:29.000
Ocean Mist Retirement hotel.
Sundays noon to 1:00.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.900
-You know Molly Feinberg?
-I don't think so.

05:31.967 --> 05:34.767
Wait a minute.
You mean Molly Feinbaum?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.867
I'm wrong.
Ocean View, not Ocean Mist.

05:37.934 --> 05:41.100
Feinstein. That's it. Gray hair, glasses.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.633
Or is it ocean spray?

05:44.066 --> 05:45.934
No. That's a cranberry juice.

05:46.633 --> 05:50.233
-Definitely ocean terrace.
-Definitely Feinstein,

05:50.300 --> 05:54.400
except she pronounces it Feinstine.
Harriet Feinstine!

05:54.467 --> 05:57.400
-I'll say hello for you.
-Would you mind? We're very close.

05:58.867 --> 06:00.033
No problem.

06:00.500 --> 06:05.233
Hey, Alvin. I've an enormous
veal and pepper sandwich here.

06:05.300 --> 06:09.300
I couldn't possibly finish it. Take half.
I made it fresh this morning.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.033
Sounds more interesting
than my tangerine.

06:12.100 --> 06:16.467
-Prepare yourself for a rare treat.
-I don't know your name.

06:17.433 --> 06:21.367
-Sophia. Sophia Petrillo.
-Italian?

06:21.433 --> 06:23.734
Try the sandwich and tell me.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.567
-I didn't hear you get up.
-I never went to sleep.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.200
Now, look, Rose, this has to stop.

06:43.266 --> 06:47.967
Now, you have been carrying on for a week.
It was only a toy animal.

06:48.700 --> 06:53.033
Fernando was more than that.
He was full of life. He was full of love.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.633
He was full of stuffing, Rose.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.300
Now, look, you gotta
get a grip on yourself.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.934
I'm sorry, I know
I'm behaving like a fool.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.200
But I got a right to sing the blues.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.934
-I lost my teddy.
-Ah, I understand, Rose.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.200
Which if I thought about, it says
something deeply disturbing about me.

07:15.266 --> 07:18.066
I gotta a right to sing the blues.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.734
Dorothy, I hope you didn't fix breakfast
for me,

07:22.800 --> 07:25.967
I'm not eating home this morning.
Someone's buying me breakfast.

07:26.033 --> 07:29.233
-Someone?
-Okay, okay, quit badgering me.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.333
-It's Alvin.
-Alvin from the boardwalk?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.467
No, Rose, Alvin from the chipmunks.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.066
Girls, guess what I found?

07:45.533 --> 07:46.834
Fernando!

07:47.867 --> 07:49.500
That's not Fernando.

07:49.567 --> 07:52.500
What do you mean?
How could you tell?

07:52.567 --> 07:54.967
Just look in his eyes.

07:56.233 --> 07:58.567
Or the price tag stuck to his back.

08:00.233 --> 08:01.300
Oops.

08:01.734 --> 08:06.000
Thanks for trying, Blanche.
It's nice to have a friend like you...

08:06.367 --> 08:07.500
who cares.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.834
Dorothy, I have a confession to make.

08:12.900 --> 08:18.533
Rose didn't lose Fernando. I gave him
to Daisy when she was helping out.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
Well, then there's no problem.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.300
Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
She's very sweet. She'll understand.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.567
I tried that. She said no.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.433
-What do you mean?
-She's not sweet anymore.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.400
She's holding Fernando for ransom.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.233
-Come on.
-Dorothy,

08:36.300 --> 08:38.233
she sent me one of his ears.

08:50.367 --> 08:52.033
-I think I got one.
-Where?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.700
Past the lifeguard stand.

08:54.633 --> 08:58.967
-Bald guy about 20 yards out?
-Yeah. Yeah, watch his face.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.300
Huh? Am I right?

09:02.900 --> 09:04.767
You got one. No doubt about it.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.333
That gentleman just peed in the ocean.

09:15.767 --> 09:18.834
-How many's that today... three? Four?
-I'm not sure.

09:19.467 --> 09:20.734
I lost track.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.967
Whatever. My point is
there's always something interesting

09:24.033 --> 09:25.233
happening at the beach.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.433
But then, I've always
been a beach person.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.500
-Not my Salvadore.
-Salvadore?

09:31.567 --> 09:33.900
-My husband.
-You have a husband?

09:34.333 --> 09:36.200
Departed. I told you.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.700
Anyway, Salvadore hated the beach.

09:39.066 --> 09:40.800
He said too many people
peed in the ocean.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.834
What about your Edna?

09:44.767 --> 09:46.700
-Edna?
-Did she like the beach?

09:50.734 --> 09:52.266
You ever notice the birds?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.567
I'm asking about your late wife.
You're asking me about birds?

09:57.834 --> 10:02.567
At the park, they want to be fed.
Here, they care for themselves.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.200
Here they could dive for clams casino.
What's your point?

10:07.333 --> 10:10.533
-I don't know.
-I'm asking about Edna.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.767
-Edna?
-Your wife!

10:19.100 --> 10:23.433
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.
I guess I just can't take a hint.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.333
Some things about Salvadore
I have trouble talking about.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.767
Other things I can't talk about
unless I want the Scarpoli family

10:31.834 --> 10:33.433
to put a contract on me.

10:36.066 --> 10:40.367
Hey, I made up that last part,
to lighten the moment.

10:42.967 --> 10:45.433
I'm sorry, Alvin. Don't cry.

10:50.033 --> 10:53.533
That's okay. You cry all you want.

11:02.567 --> 11:08.633
-Daisy, why won't you give the bear back?
-Because he belongs to me.

11:08.700 --> 11:12.233
He does not belong to you, sweetheart.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.767
-No. He belongs to Rose.
-She gave him to me.

11:15.834 --> 11:19.767
-But I had no right.
-You made a mistake?

11:19.834 --> 11:22.667
Yes, that's right. Just a silly mistake.

11:22.734 --> 11:25.867
In sunshine cadets, we learn you have
to pay for your mistakes.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.166
This will cost you a 10-speed Schwinn.

11:31.567 --> 11:36.633
Didn't the sunshine cadets teach you
anything about honesty and decency

11:36.700 --> 11:38.567
and respect for your elders?

11:38.633 --> 11:42.433
That was scheduled
for the weekend at lake wa-ka-ta-kee.

11:42.934 --> 11:46.934
I missed it,
grounded for smoking in the boys' John.

11:49.567 --> 11:50.767
Dorothy, we're shafted.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.767
Could you have the bike by this weekend?

11:56.066 --> 11:58.700
Listen, Daisy.
I don't like being intimidated.

11:58.767 --> 12:02.433
I don't like being threatened.
Frankly, kid, I don't like you.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.767
I'm not buying you anything.
I'll tell your folks.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.433
I'll call the school for bad girls.

12:09.500 --> 12:14.000
They'll pick you up, put you in a sack,
and take you away...

12:17.200 --> 12:21.600
and you'll never eat ice cream
or play jump rope again.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.467
Get real, grandma.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.000
Either way I'll get the bike.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.734
My folks will feel terrible

12:32.800 --> 12:36.066
because two mean old ladies
forced me to return my toy.

12:36.533 --> 12:39.667
And because it was ruined
in the accident.

12:39.734 --> 12:42.133
-Accident?
-See this water pistol?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.967
It's loaded with red ink.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
Hi, everybody.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.834
Rose, she's got
the teddy bear and a water pistol.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.166
What?

12:52.934 --> 12:56.567
It won't sound less ridiculous
hearing it again.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.166
You found my teddy! Where was he?

12:59.700 --> 13:01.967
-You didn't tell her?
-Tell me what?

13:02.367 --> 13:04.033
The price
just went up.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.567
I'll get back to you within 48 hours.

13:10.166 --> 13:13.900
-Where did she take Fernando?
-She took him home.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.500
Rose, see, honey,

13:15.567 --> 13:18.900
Fernando doesn't
exactly belong to you anymore.

13:18.967 --> 13:23.000
I kind of gave him to Daisy by mistake.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.800
Get him back.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.633
I want my teddy.

13:30.700 --> 13:34.333
You can't expect a child
to give back a toy.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.533
You do understand, don't you?

13:36.600 --> 13:40.266
Just cut the crap
and get back the damn bear.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.600
-Know what time it is?
-9:00.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.367
In your dreams.
You take the wrong bus?

13:55.734 --> 13:59.100
-You didn't miss anything.
-What are you doing?

13:59.166 --> 14:02.767
I think I'm crocheting,
but I wouldn't swear to it.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.433
This is my seat.
You're sitting in my seat.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.433
I didn't know your 80-year-old butt
was so sensitive.

14:11.467 --> 14:16.500
-You got no right sitting in my seat.
-Relax. I'm moving.

14:16.567 --> 14:19.033
You're always doing this!

14:19.100 --> 14:21.633
You're never thinking
about anybody but yourself!

14:21.700 --> 14:26.367
-What are you talking about?
-You know. I didn't take the wrong bus.

14:26.433 --> 14:30.333
That dumb-ass driver went the wrong way,
and you know it!

14:31.166 --> 14:32.633
What the hell's the matter with you?

14:33.300 --> 14:34.300
Alvin.

14:34.834 --> 14:35.967
Alvin!

14:50.500 --> 14:51.900
Good morning, Sophia.

14:52.367 --> 14:55.567
-What are you doing?
-I'm levitating, Rose, get lost.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.400
Ah, come back here.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.667
You didn't deserve that,
you're a good kid.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.166
-I'm just a little depressed.
-Really?

15:05.834 --> 15:07.333
You know, I'm depressed too.

15:07.934 --> 15:10.800
-What are you depressed about?
-Alvin and I had a fight.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.467
I'm making a scarf for
a friend I don't have anymore.

15:13.533 --> 15:18.133
I know exactly how you feel.
I made these for Fernando.

15:21.266 --> 15:23.133
I thought you broke up with that midget.

15:25.767 --> 15:29.600
Fernando's not a midget,
he's my oldest and closest friend.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.800
I didn't know Alvin that long
but I thought we were getting close.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.900
I can't believe he just walked away.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.233
Fernando was always there for me.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.000
Whenever I scared
or down about something

15:41.066 --> 15:44.834
I'd just roll over and snuggle up
against him in bed.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.567
I never went to bed with Alvin.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.633
The though never crossed my mind
which is odd

15:49.700 --> 15:51.934
because I always wondered about that myth.

15:56.934 --> 15:59.166
There's a myth about people
named Alvin?

16:00.934 --> 16:03.900
The myth about black
men in the bedroom.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.567
Is that a Greek myth?

16:10.166 --> 16:12.567
-(doorbell rings)
-Get the door, Rose.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.567
-It's you.
-Good morning.

16:20.633 --> 16:23.600
-What do you want?
-I changed my mind.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.834
-Asking for gifts was wrong.
-I knew she'd come to her senses.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.433
I decided cash is better.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.467
That way I can buy exactly what I want.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.500
I'll get my purse.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.500
No, Blanche.
I'm not letting you do that.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.133
I've been thinking a lot.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.900
If after these years of
love and companionship,

16:44.967 --> 16:48.300
Fernando and I must part company,
I'll have to accept that.

16:49.033 --> 16:52.600
Sometimes, life deals you
an unfriendly hand.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.166
There's nothing you can do about it.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.300
I guess there's a lesson
to be learned here.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.700
Sometimes life just isn't fair, kiddo.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.600
-Good for you!
-Terrific.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.834
-Morning.
-Alvin!

17:24.133 --> 17:25.800
Am I sitting in the right place?

17:25.867 --> 17:30.800
If you're looking for the Jacksonville
bus, you could be in big trouble.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.467
You old geezer.
You know what I'm talking about.

17:33.533 --> 17:36.967
You don't know what
you're talking about,

17:37.033 --> 17:40.266
especially when you mutter in Italian.

17:40.333 --> 17:44.500
I swear, you make up half those words.
I brought you this.

17:44.567 --> 17:45.834
Because you're sorry?

17:45.900 --> 17:48.867
Because I'm thirsty.
I figured you might be.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.000
Whatever.

17:55.433 --> 17:57.367
They're really quite a pair, aren't they?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.133
Excuse me?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.734
My father and your mother.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.433
They sit like that all day, every day.

18:07.266 --> 18:09.133
He's even started
referring to my husband

18:09.200 --> 18:10.900
as "that dumb bajagaloop."

18:12.233 --> 18:14.934
How did you know she was my mother?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.967
Just a guess, from the way
you were watching.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.667
And after what happened yesterday,
I thought you might show up.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.100
He told you about the fight.

18:23.734 --> 18:25.333
I saw it. I was here.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.066
There's no problem now.

18:29.133 --> 18:32.066
You said this was a cold drink.
It's lukewarm.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.567
I said no ice.

18:33.633 --> 18:36.233
Dumb bajagaloop.
What do you think makes it cold?

18:37.834 --> 18:42.500
Your attitude is making me cold.
Lighten up and say thank you.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.100
All right.
Thank you.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.667
What?

18:53.734 --> 18:56.533
Thanks for the soda. We're even.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.000
This fight was my fault.
Yesterday was yours.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.934
Yesterday?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.867
If you're willing to forget about it,
so am I.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.734
He has his good days and his bad days.

19:10.266 --> 19:14.200
-We never know what to expect.
-My mother can be the same way.

19:14.934 --> 19:18.000
I guess it's just part of getting older.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.300
Some of it...

19:21.767 --> 19:23.967
but my father isn't
going to get any better.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.166
He's only going to get worse.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.734
That's when this salesman
walks across the store

19:42.800 --> 19:44.867
into ladies' petite and says,

19:44.934 --> 19:48.033
"Excuse me, miss,
but I noticed you can't decide

19:48.100 --> 19:51.166
between the turquoise strapless
and the red backless.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.100
Personally,
I'd like you in the backless."

19:54.166 --> 19:57.633
And I said, "When?"
And he said, "How about Saturday night?"

19:57.700 --> 20:00.767
And I said, "How about in your dreams,
sleazo?"

20:02.333 --> 20:04.333
Can you believe his nerve?

20:06.233 --> 20:08.367
What were you doing in ladies' petite?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.700
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

20:21.033 --> 20:23.633
-You got a minute?
-Sure.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.800
Good. Crochet me a scarf.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.800
I need to talk to you about Alvin.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.500
He's sick, ma.

20:36.066 --> 20:39.200
-You've never even seen him.
-I've seen him.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.900
After that fight, I was worried about you,
and I followed you.

20:43.967 --> 20:45.900
That was you? Thank God.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.200
I thought Gino the enforcer
was out on parole.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.800
Will you let me say what I have to say?

20:54.900 --> 20:56.867
Maybe I don't want
to hear what you have to say.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.867
Maybe I'm happier not knowing.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.967
Maybe you know already.

21:01.767 --> 21:02.934
I'm not stupid.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.633
I could see something about Alvin
wasn't right.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.367
He has Alzheimer's disease.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.867
I met his daughter down at the boardwalk.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.100
She said when he first
started wandering off,

21:21.166 --> 21:25.033
she followed him everywhere.
She took a leave of absence from her job

21:25.100 --> 21:26.567
to look after him...

21:27.266 --> 21:30.567
but she can't afford that much longer.

21:33.033 --> 21:35.400
The family's discussed
sending him to New York.

21:35.467 --> 21:39.834
He has a nephew who's a doctor
and can give him special care.

21:40.400 --> 21:46.900
Sandra says that within two months
they'll have to do that.

21:49.467 --> 21:53.900
People think if you live to be my age,
you should be grateful just to be alive.

21:54.767 --> 21:56.900
That's not how it works.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.834
You need a reason to get up in the
morning.

21:59.900 --> 22:04.700
Sometimes, even after you find one,
life can spit in your face.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.533
I'm sorry, ma.

22:11.567 --> 22:12.900
A few months, huh?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.934
That's enough time to finish the scarf.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.066
Ma?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.333
-How long have you been here?
-A while.

23:00.233 --> 23:02.066
He's not coming back, is he?

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
No.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.767
It was a nice couple of months.

23:07.667 --> 23:08.667
I'll miss him.

23:10.033 --> 23:11.433
Do you think he'll remember me?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.166
I don't know.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.000
I'll remember him.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.100
I finished the scarf, you know.

23:19.166 --> 23:24.633
Next time we go to New York,
maybe you'll take it to him.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.934
Nah. I'll mail it.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.200
That way, I'll always picture him
right here on the boardwalk.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.600
Hey!

23:34.667 --> 23:35.934
Someone's sitting there!

24:08.967 --> 24:15.100
(theme music playing)
