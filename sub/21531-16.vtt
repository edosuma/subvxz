WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:10.010
Oh, my God, pregnant?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.113
That's...

00:12.213 --> 00:15.349
That's...whatever you think that
is, I think that is too.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.487
You dog.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.126
Grace...

00:25.226 --> 00:27.661
you're going to have
a Jewish, black baby.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.167
I believe that's called
a macaroon.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.174
It's not James' baby.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.043
It's Leo's.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.044
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

00:44.145 --> 00:45.379
I think you dodged a bullet,

00:45.479 --> 00:49.117
'cause there's serious
alcoholism in my family.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.551
Leo?

00:50.651 --> 00:52.353
What--when you had sex
on the plane?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.088
You told me you--
you were safe.

00:54.188 --> 00:57.591
Oh, I thought you meant
did we have our seatbelts on.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.196
Shall I sing to your belly?

01:04.265 --> 01:07.201
I'm hazy as to why
I would do this,

01:07.301 --> 01:09.537
but I distinctly recall
those sort of shenanigans

01:09.637 --> 01:12.473
on the last season
of Mad About You.

01:12.573 --> 01:17.111
* HER baby takes
the morning TRAIN *

01:17.211 --> 01:22.250
* IT works from 9:00
to 5:00 and THEN *

01:22.350 --> 01:26.520
Well, Grace's baby already works
more than you do.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.657
Hey, hey, hey, now,
come on.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.292
Now, Grace...

01:31.392 --> 01:35.696
You say this man
was called Leo.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.865
Did you get a last name?

01:41.369 --> 01:43.204
Oy.
I'm taking a nap.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.406
I might be out for a while.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.776
Wake me if you hear
a baby crying.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.779
[upbeat jazz music]

01:51.879 --> 01:56.417
*

02:01.522 --> 02:03.657
[scoffs]
This line.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.659
I want to get home
before Grace wakes up.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.596
Unbelievable--this woman
is paying for a 55-cent cookie

02:08.696 --> 02:10.431
with a check.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.401
Oh, and look at that.
They don't accept checks.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.671
But lucky for us, she has
1,000 pennies in a baggie.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.440
Relax, relax, baby.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.808
When you tense up like that,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.911
I can see what you're gonna
look like when you're old.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.881
All right, come on.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.650
I think I know of a way we can
get out of here fast.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.187
Excuse me, could we just get
two coffees and two muffins?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.389
Yeah, and I'm just getting
a cookie, so wait your turn.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.759
Um, I'm sorry,
it's just that, uh,

02:38.859 --> 02:41.395
well, my mother is--is--
she's dying.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.897
And I was just sitting
by her bedside feeling helpless.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.666
When she told me
to get a muffin,

02:45.766 --> 02:49.570
I jumped at the opportunity to--
to finally do something.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.639
Your mother's dying?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.574
Yeah, I think we've run out
of miracles.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.917
Hey, guys.
Is Grace up?

03:04.017 --> 03:07.488
No, the Mile High Mom
is still sleeping.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.793
Hey, what's in the bag, fag?

03:14.762 --> 03:16.364
Oh, muffins from James.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.599
Do you think it's weird that he
got them by cutting in line

03:18.699 --> 03:22.202
and then lying about needing
them for his dying mother?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.203
No, not at all, honey.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.338
I mean, that's the same way

03:24.438 --> 03:25.973
that we used to get
bread and juice

03:26.073 --> 03:29.243
during the Great Depre--

03:32.413 --> 03:35.749
'80s.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.687
Clever idea.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.688
Much better than

03:40.788 --> 03:41.955
the scam I usually use.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.825
I have this neighbor
who never locks his door.

03:44.925 --> 03:50.731
I just sneak in when he's
showering and fill up my therm--

03:52.766 --> 03:53.834
'80s.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.772
So you don't think
it's creepy?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.641
No, honey.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.276
As a matter of fact,
he probably just did it

04:02.376 --> 04:04.278
so you could get
back here to Grace.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.613
Well, that's true.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.281
I just hadn't seen
that side of him before.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.783
Of course, I've only known him
for five days.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.785
I like that he's edgy.
You know...

04:11.885 --> 04:12.786
'Cause I'm edgy too.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.857
Like, sometimes, you know,
when I-I-I throw gum

04:16.957 --> 04:18.859
into a public trash can,
and it sticks to the side?

04:18.959 --> 04:23.364
I just keep on walking.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.966
N.M.P.
Not My Problem.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.271
God.

04:40.814 --> 04:44.318
Man, that was a really good nap.
What'd I miss?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.354
Tuesday.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.757
You've been out for, like,
20 hours.

04:49.857 --> 04:53.327
No wonder I'm hungry.
I missed, like, seven meals.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.597
Well, you are eating for two.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.665
Eating for two?

04:58.532 --> 04:59.500
Why would you say
that I'm eating--

04:59.533 --> 05:01.469
Ahh!
I'm pregnant!

05:02.770 --> 05:07.375
I totally forgot.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.343
I'm gonna be an unwed mother.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.778
No, you're not.
You married James two days ago.

05:10.878 --> 05:14.548
Ahh!
I'm married!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.949
I totally forgot.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.084
Honey, you think
that's upsetting?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.752
Check this out.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.454
[screaming]

05:21.689 --> 05:25.926
Yeah, I thought
we could get three.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.329
Listen, Grace, this seems
as good a time as any

05:29.430 --> 05:30.664
to ask for a little favor.

05:31.799 --> 05:35.636
Uh, the ratings for Jack Talk
have been slipping,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.571
which is why I need
to do something

05:37.671 --> 05:40.073
bigger, bolder,
and more derivative.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.775
So, I...

05:41.875 --> 05:43.811
would like you...

05:43.911 --> 05:46.514
to give birth,
live, on my talk show!

05:47.781 --> 05:49.683
How exciting would that be?

05:49.783 --> 05:50.784
I'm picturing you
shooting it out

05:50.884 --> 05:53.086
into a rainbow flag dog bed.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.426
Get him out of here.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.861
Well, you didn't let me finish.

06:00.961 --> 06:05.433
There is a dog in it.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.135
God, this is so overwhelming.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.905
Please, someone tell me
what to do first.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.908
Well, have you called Leo yet
to tell him he's gonna be a dad?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.076
Yeah.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.146
Right after I got
out of the doctor's office.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.449
His machine said that
he was out of the country.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.884
I don't even know where he is
or when he's coming back.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.419
[Karen sighing]

06:25.519 --> 06:27.054
Oh, Grace.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.923
Honey, I'm so sorry.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.826
Is this Leo
a flight attendant?

06:38.098 --> 06:41.535
Karen, Leo is a doctor.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.438
He works for Doctors
Without Borders.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.073
Oh, Leo!
Honey, I'm sorry!

06:46.173 --> 06:49.577
Oh, my gosh, I feel so stupid.
Leo, of course.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.411
Leo. I can see him
perfectly now.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.013
[under her breath]
God, what's that
gonna look like?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.754
Well...

07:00.854 --> 07:02.590
well, then maybe we should
try to track him down.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.458
Doctors Without Borders
will know where he is.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.059
Oh, Will, now,
you leave her alone.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.095
She doesn't have
to call him right now.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.863
In fact...

07:09.963 --> 07:11.699
She doesn't have
to call him at all.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.135
You can come live
with me, Grace.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.170
Honey, I could be
your baby daddy.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.845
Okay, so it's all set.
Great, listen--

07:24.945 --> 07:27.881
I'm just gonna run out, buy a
little teeny, tiny silver spoon,

07:27.981 --> 07:29.917
then right after that, I'm gonna
go shopping for the baby.

07:30.017 --> 07:30.951
Okay.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.989
If she offers
to powder the baby,

07:36.089 --> 07:37.991
say no.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.932
You know what?

07:45.032 --> 07:47.535
I am gonna leave
my cell phone number

07:47.635 --> 07:48.869
on Leo's machine.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.070
That way he'll always have
another place

07:50.170 --> 07:51.505
to look to find you.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.640
Put the phone down.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.707
No, it'll just take
a second.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.075
Will, please, put it down.
Why?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.777
Because he's home, okay?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.981
I checked with his hospital.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.050
He just got back to New York.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.086
I don't understand.
What--

08:06.186 --> 08:08.589
What's going on?
Are you not gonna tell him?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.990
Of course I am, buttwipe!

08:14.662 --> 08:15.629
What?

08:15.729 --> 08:19.533
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hormone surge.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.904
It was the baby talking.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.507
Well, it has its mother's charm.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.678
Look, I know I have to tell him.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.979
It's just that it's...

08:32.079 --> 08:32.980
It's hard.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.114
I mean, I've--I've--

08:35.048 --> 08:36.650
I've pushed him away
so many times, and--

08:36.750 --> 08:39.052
And what--now I'm just gonna
show up and say,

08:39.152 --> 08:41.889
"Guess what?
You're gonna be a father."

08:41.989 --> 08:43.557
I mean, I don't--
I don't

08:43.657 --> 08:47.027
want him coming back just
because I'm having a baby.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.030
Oh, my God,
but you do want him back.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.966
Of course I do, you pile!

08:55.736 --> 08:59.039
Who are you giving birth to?
Roseanne?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.080
Sorry.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.782
Will, this--
This is just--

09:08.882 --> 09:10.951
This is just so crazy.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.786
I mean...

09:12.886 --> 09:15.689
When I found out that I was
pregnant with Leo's baby,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.591
I felt a million things.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.128
But the first thing I felt...

09:21.228 --> 09:23.664
was happy.

09:23.764 --> 09:28.802
You know how happy he's gonna be
to hear you say that?

09:31.839 --> 09:32.940
He will, won't he?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.708
Mm-hmm.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.811
Oh, my God.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.046
[giggles]

09:40.080 --> 09:42.983
You're gonna have Leo back,
and I've got James...

09:43.083 --> 09:44.618
We...

09:44.718 --> 09:46.920
Could we actually have
everything?

09:49.056 --> 09:51.158
I think we might.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.828
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.263
I am.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.666
Let's call our friends
and rub it in their faces.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.239
(Karen)
So...

10:06.339 --> 10:09.609
things are really working out
for you two, huh?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.610
Mm.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.279
Grace is having a baby, and...

10:12.379 --> 10:13.346
going to get her hubby back.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.685
You've got Seal.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.258
Everybody's got something
but me.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.627
What are you talking about?

10:27.728 --> 10:30.731
You're worth $740 million.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.334
You--you've got a husband
who adores you.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.870
And you have the dark gift
of eternal life.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.872
Mm.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.744
Hope I picked
the right thing to wear.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.378
I'm going for the...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.948
"Love of your life
is not trapping you

10:48.048 --> 10:50.718
into marriage with
a surprise pregnancy" look.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.921
God, I remember the first year
that look hit the runways.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.724
I thought,
who's gonna wear that?

10:58.425 --> 10:59.727
Hi, Grace.
Oh!

10:59.827 --> 11:01.661
Listen, glad I caught you.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.363
So excited about the baby.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.867
Now, do a gay brother
a solid?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.736
Swallow this tiny camera?

11:10.337 --> 11:13.273
It's for a new segment
on Jack Talk I'm gonna call

11:13.373 --> 11:16.009
"Let's meet us the fetus".

11:21.248 --> 11:23.216
Um, Jack?

11:23.316 --> 11:27.154
The baby is not
in my digestive system.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.688
Okay.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.758
But if it were,

11:30.858 --> 11:34.995
this is the race car
from a Monopoly game.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.265
Well, the real camera's
bigger than this.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.834
We gotta start small
and widen your throat.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.237
Oh, Jack,
I feel a kick.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.806
[kick thuds]
Oh!

11:51.812 --> 11:56.149
So far, I do not like that baby.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.752
But your boyfriend,
on the other hand,

11:58.852 --> 12:01.154
is not only easy on the eyes,

12:01.254 --> 12:05.225
he is H-I-lari-O-U-S!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.060
Why?
What'd he do?
Okay--

12:07.160 --> 12:08.762
As we were leaving the gym,

12:08.862 --> 12:11.932
it was pouring rain,
and there were no cabs anywhere.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.266
[laughing]
Okay?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.067
And there was this

12:14.167 --> 12:16.336
nurse standing outside
the hospital

12:16.436 --> 12:19.072
who'd obviously been waiting
quite a while.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.507
Yeah? And?

12:20.607 --> 12:22.910
And so this cab pulls up,

12:23.010 --> 12:25.445
and James yanks me
right past her.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.479
And as we get in,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.882
James turns to me,
and he says--

12:28.982 --> 12:31.284
Wait, you stole a cab
from a nurse?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.420
Yeah! In the rain.
Anyways--

12:33.520 --> 12:35.889
Anyway...

12:35.989 --> 12:37.324
James made the funniest joke.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.859
This is so funny.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.762
I'm already laughing.
I don't even know what it is.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.297
That is so James.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.765
I know, right?
Right?

12:45.866 --> 12:46.867
She was mad!

12:46.967 --> 12:49.002
She was shaking
that crutch at us

12:49.102 --> 12:50.470
as we drove away.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.471
Anyways--

12:51.571 --> 12:53.073
Anyways, James says--

12:53.173 --> 12:55.976
Please share our cab,
wet, disabled nurse?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.410
No, no, no.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.279
James says,

12:59.379 --> 13:01.949
Oh!
Now I can't remember.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.253
All right, let me start over.
Your boyfriend is H-I--

13:06.353 --> 13:07.888
Yeah, yeah, all right,
yeah, yeah.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.393
I'm having lunch with James.
He can tell me the story.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.996
I'm sure you got it
wrong anyway.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.497
After all, you are the person

13:17.597 --> 13:20.567
who thought Dick Cheney
was a bondage toy.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.340
So I had a really fun time
with Jack before.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.877
Oh, did he tell you--
[laughing]

13:29.977 --> 13:32.179
The funniest thing
happened to us.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.914
Oh, I'm glad you brought
this up, because--

13:34.014 --> 13:37.284
Yes, he did tell me the story,
but I'm sure he got it wrong.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.086
Let me tell you,
'cause it was hilarious.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.353
Okay, 'cause I'm dying
to hear it.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.089
All right, we, uh,
we're coming out of the gym,

13:42.189 --> 13:45.092
[chuckling]

13:45.192 --> 13:46.526
Oh, man,
this is really funny.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.195
Tell me, tell me.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.330
It's pouring down rain, okay?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.965
And we can't find
a cab anywhere.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.400
And there's this nurse--

13:53.500 --> 13:55.135
Uh-huh?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.004
So this cab pulls up--

13:57.104 --> 13:59.572
And I mean, it's coming
down in buckets, right?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.341
Lotta rain, got it.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
And then there's
little nursey, okay?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.513
Oh, God.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.981
So--

14:08.081 --> 14:09.917
So we run past her,
hopped in the cab--

14:10.017 --> 14:11.851
[laughing]

14:11.952 --> 14:13.320
I'm sorry.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.924
Every time I think about it,
it gets me going again.

14:17.024 --> 14:17.925
My stomach.
Ooh.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.626
Did I tell you
she had a eye patch?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.929
Stop the story!

14:22.029 --> 14:24.564
What's the matter?

14:24.664 --> 14:27.901
I'm sorry, but I think
I'm missing something

14:28.001 --> 14:29.336
in the obviously
delightful tale

14:29.436 --> 14:31.604
of the wet, limping, underpaid
healthcare worker

14:31.704 --> 14:32.940
who gets pushed out of the way

14:33.040 --> 14:35.342
by two healthy young men
with umbrellas.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.011
No, I'm sorry.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.413
My friends tell me I have
a wicked sense of humor.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.315
It drove my ex-boyfriend crazy.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.652
You've never mentioned
an ex-boyfriend.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.921
Well, good, good. That's--
that's a good change of topic.

14:48.021 --> 14:48.922
Let's talk about that.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.590
Okay, uh, well,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.927
Curtis and I were together
for about three years.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.629
He was funny, handsome,
a lot like you.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.431
Aw.
Uh...but then he got

14:58.531 --> 14:59.899
in a terrible skiing accident

15:00.000 --> 15:02.902
and was in the hospital
for about a year.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.404
God, that's awful.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.174
Must've been an incredible
strain on your relationship.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.308
Oh, not for me.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.010
I was outta there
in the first week.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.979
Who wants to deal with that?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.247
[laughing]

15:19.719 --> 15:21.421
Hey.
Hi.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.090
Listen, I'm--
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.492
I crossed the International
Date Line on the way here,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.927
so I thought we already
had this meeting.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.029
[laughing]

15:29.129 --> 15:30.030
You look good.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.064
Oh, you look good too.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.533
I heard you just got back
into the country.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.207
So, I, um...

15:40.307 --> 15:41.341
I--

15:42.275 --> 15:44.144
Let--let me make this
easier for both of us.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.714
I think I know
why you wanted to meet me.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.017
You do?

15:50.117 --> 15:52.419
Yeah.
You heard about Kate.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.555
Right.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.589
Kate.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.325
I been meaning to call you.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.460
I even wrote, like,
three drafts of a letter.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.229
You know, I just didn't know
how to tell you.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.564
How do you tell your ex-wife
you're getting remarried?

16:04.664 --> 16:05.598
[chuckles]

16:06.699 --> 16:08.968
You're getting remarried.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.039
You knew, right?
Oh, yes.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.074
I--yeah.
Uh-huh.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.308
I just, um--

16:15.408 --> 16:17.444
I guess it just

16:17.544 --> 16:19.279
feels a little--
a little weird

16:19.379 --> 16:21.048
hearing it, you know,
right from you.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.682
I know, I know.
It feels weird for me too.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.484
I mean, when we saw
each other in London,

16:24.584 --> 16:26.119
you know, I was thinking...

16:26.219 --> 16:30.057
maybe there's a chance
that you and I could...

16:30.157 --> 16:31.291
you know.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.694
But you said you were gonna
move on with your life

16:34.794 --> 16:36.029
and that I should too.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.600
Yes, yes. I...
I did, I said that.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.735
I-I really--
I didn't think I could

16:42.835 --> 16:45.705
ever fall in love
with anyone else,

16:45.805 --> 16:47.440
and then I met Kate.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.542
Oh.
I love her, she's great.
Wow.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.677
You're really
gonna like her too.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.679
Yay.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.714
[sighing]

16:54.814 --> 16:58.051
I am so glad that you
found someone, Leo.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.787
That's all I wanted
to say.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.256
I just wanted to say it
in person, that's all.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.093
That means so much to me.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.727
[laughs]

17:10.797 --> 17:12.732
Well, it was great
to see you.
Mm.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.402
God, Grace, I thought
this was gonna be so awkward,

17:15.502 --> 17:16.503
and it--and it totally wasn't.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.071
No, no.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.539
No, not at all.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.081
Bye, Leo.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.416
Bye, Grace.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.256
Bye.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.166
Is Grace home yet?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.768
Not yet.
Whatcha got there, honey?

17:48.868 --> 17:52.572
Well, you know, I tried
to work with Grace.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.607
I asked her nicely...

17:54.707 --> 17:57.110
to swallow a camera.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.645
And she said no.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.148
So if she's not gonna share
that baby with me willingly,

18:01.248 --> 18:02.349
I'm gonna have to resort
to trickery

18:02.449 --> 18:03.850
to capture her pregnancy
for Jack Talk.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.155
I've hidden, inside this horse,

18:08.255 --> 18:10.257
a state-of-the-art camera

18:10.357 --> 18:11.558
and microphone.

18:19.866 --> 18:20.867
Can you tell?

18:20.967 --> 18:23.102
Honey, I can't even see
the horse.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.576
Hello, Willard.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.178
How was lunch with James.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.580
Good. Interesting.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.183
We had French food, which
I didn't even know he liked.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.151
But then again, we just met,
so there's a lot of things

18:38.251 --> 18:39.219
we don't know
about each other.

18:40.086 --> 18:40.820
Like, for instance,
up until yesterday,

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
he didn't know
I'd never been to Vancouver,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.392
and I didn't know that
he'd fake his mother's death

18:45.425 --> 18:47.126
just to avoid waiting
in line for coffee.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.895
Oh, another new discovery--

18:48.995 --> 18:52.165
I hate cilantro,
he hates the handicapped.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.834
I shouldn't say hate.
"Hate" is a strong word.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.170
Abandons.
He abandons the handicapped.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.705
Again, learning.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.241
And what I'm learning is that
I never want to see him again,

19:01.341 --> 19:03.276
because every new
bone-chilling discovery

19:03.376 --> 19:04.411
I make about the man

19:05.345 --> 19:06.779
makes me want
to trade him in for credit

19:06.813 --> 19:07.780
at the hot Canadian freak store.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.153
Hi.
Hey.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.822
How'd it go with Leo?

19:15.922 --> 19:19.492
Oh, um, he...

19:19.592 --> 19:22.595
He met someone, and he's--
he's, uh, engaged.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.331
Oh, God.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.933
Well, what did he say
about the baby?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.702
Oh, I didn't tell him.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.837
I mean, I--

19:30.937 --> 19:34.307
I will, but it's,
you know, just...

19:34.407 --> 19:36.175
I just couldn't,
not then, not...

19:36.276 --> 19:39.212
not right after he told me
he was getting married.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.447
[Will sighing]

19:40.547 --> 19:43.182
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

19:48.255 --> 19:52.259
I guess I was crazy
to think that...

19:52.359 --> 19:55.595
all of a sudden we could just
have a happy family.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.964
Honey, you do have a family.

19:58.064 --> 20:01.234
And I don't mean
those Jews in Schenectady.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.469
I mean us.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.609
That's right.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.677
We're in this together.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.712
Whatever you need,
we are there for you.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.381
(Jack)
It's true, Grace.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.517
We'll be right by your side,
every step of the way.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.386
Thanks, Jack.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.962
[quietly]
Day one: devastation.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.671
Sign here and here,

20:38.771 --> 20:42.008
and your marriage to James
is officially annulled.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.776
You sure you want me
to do this?

20:43.876 --> 20:48.281
Okay, he lied about
his mother's death for muffins.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.951
He abandoned his physically
disabled boyfriend.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.421
But seriously.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.357
You are never gonna get
a hotter guy than that.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.795
He also said,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.031
"How are we gonna shake
the knocked-up redhead?"

21:05.131 --> 21:05.231
Back to Canada, Baldy.
