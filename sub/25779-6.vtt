WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:19.800
Hey, Larry?

00:21.480 --> 00:22.595
Larry, are you OK?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.186
He doesn't need you.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.916
Hey, Loomis.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.416
I heard something.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.081
Heard your mother wears army boots.

00:52.210 --> 00:53.917
-She'll do it with anybody.
-Shut up.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.712
My ma said she saw her
and Mr. Smith eating at Nino's.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.258
Said she was laughing like a hyena
and touching him all over.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.710
Said it was disgusting.

01:05.770 --> 01:08.307
-Now you're gonna get it.
-But I'm going down swinging.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.522
There was a boy

01:22.370 --> 01:26.739
A very strange, enchanted boy

01:27.540 --> 01:31.829
They say he wandered very far...

01:32.880 --> 01:34.086
We're going to London.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.637
Hi, Wally. Can I talk to my mom?

01:39.260 --> 01:42.218
I'd prefer it if you addressed me
by the title of the office, Larry.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.727
Oh, dearest Sovereign Protector--

01:45.850 --> 01:46.840
Larry!

01:47.850 --> 01:50.649
-I'm sorry. He's been like this.
-It's OK.

01:51.980 --> 01:55.143
He who thinks a fire... is a fire.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.235
Remember that.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.486
Screw you.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.110
Larry.

02:04.410 --> 02:05.866
Mr. Smith and I?

02:06.290 --> 02:08.327
Larry, that's ridiculous.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.949
Don't listen to rumors.

02:10.419 --> 02:13.412
-Just because we're going to London--
-Wait, wait, wait!

02:13.960 --> 02:14.950
London?

02:15.380 --> 02:18.179
-What the hell?
-I just found out myself.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.468
-We're leaving tonight.
-Mom, what about his wife?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.763
Linnie understands. You will, too.

02:25.140 --> 02:29.896
The Sovereign Protector
needs my help.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.647
Mom, he does dry-cleaning.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.146
I wish I could tell you everything.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.987
It would make this so much easier.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.192
You're gonna leave me alone
in the apartment?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.288
You're old enough
to take care of yourself.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.328
If you need anything,
come to the Lodge.

02:47.870 --> 02:49.497
The knights will help you.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.452
Mom, don't go. He doesn't need you.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.332
Why do you believe
everything he says?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.916
Go pig out on some turkey.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.621
Be thankful, Larry.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.347
Be thankful.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.972
It's omelet time.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.261
Oh, yeah.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.101
The Larry Special.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.271
I hope you guys are hungry.

03:25.950 --> 03:26.781
Damn it.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.110
Oh, well.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.281
We'll just have to make
our rations last.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.531
We need to talk about last night.

03:35.670 --> 03:36.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm OK.

03:37.130 --> 03:38.507
Too many vodka stingers.

03:39.090 --> 03:40.376
It happens. I'm fine.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.421
You were walking around naked.

03:42.930 --> 03:45.501
Yeah. Hilarious, wasn't it?

03:47.060 --> 03:50.303
So, what are people saying
about my junk?

03:54.270 --> 03:57.353
People were just really worried
about you last night, Lar.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.930
You know,
not about your junk, per se, but--

04:00.070 --> 04:01.060
Larry...

04:01.820 --> 04:04.232
Something's wrong. You need rest.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.368
Maybe you can stay
at my place for a while.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.869
Yeah. I can sort of... I can sort of
trailer-sit for a while.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.206
It's perfect timing.

04:12.330 --> 04:15.209
My sister just kind of
evicted me last night.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.331
Why?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.240
Oh, there's no... no real reason.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.007
Just money, you know?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.677
But, yeah, I start a new temp job.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.179
It's graveyard,
so I can crash here all day.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.763
You know, sort of be caretaker
for the property, you know?

04:31.890 --> 04:34.188
This property doesn't exist.

04:37.060 --> 04:38.061
OK.

04:38.980 --> 04:39.970
Well...

04:41.150 --> 04:42.640
I need to get on the road.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.606
But I can come by tonight.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.020
Keep an eye on him this afternoon?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.275
Hey, hey, hey.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.651
Stop talking about me
like I'm not here.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.031
I'm doing fine on my own.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.375
Shit! Fire!

05:33.500 --> 05:36.618
You said you were seeing
a shadow or something?

05:37.750 --> 05:38.820
I saw...

05:44.130 --> 05:45.336
I don't know what I saw.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.375
Let's cover your left eye.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.347
Try reading the bottom line.

05:51.470 --> 05:52.710
X, V...

05:53.600 --> 05:57.264
<i>N, ARGW, AL.</i>

05:58.020 --> 05:59.476
OK. That's good enough.

06:03.650 --> 06:07.609
You should just open a business where
people get to come into a dark room

06:07.740 --> 06:09.902
and answer simple questions.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.862
That is a great idea.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.537
Do people ever tell you
their secrets?

06:17.660 --> 06:18.661
All the time.

06:21.670 --> 06:22.660
Like...

06:24.170 --> 06:25.160
"Doctor...

06:26.010 --> 06:30.129
I've been having an affair,
and the guy doesn't even know

06:30.260 --> 06:32.638
I have what's apparently
a terminal illness"?

06:34.220 --> 06:35.802
No. No, nothing that dark.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.607
Good news. Your eyes are fine.

06:44.980 --> 06:45.970
I know.

06:47.530 --> 06:48.941
What do you know about Captain?

06:49.320 --> 06:52.062
I've got a theory about Captain.
He's not a real guy.

06:52.570 --> 06:55.483
Serious. Think about it.
No one's ever met him.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.361
He's just a line item
on a spreadsheet

06:57.500 --> 06:59.707
for some heavy dudes
we'll never know.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.201
Captain's a tax write-off.

07:02.710 --> 07:05.247
He's the shadow of the dream
that never was.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.451
No, Captain's real. I met him.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.297
-What does he look like?
-He's white.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.876
No shit! What else?

07:11.010 --> 07:13.843
Man, I don't know!
He's a white-looking white dude.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.961
They say he's somewhere
in the desert now.

07:16.810 --> 07:17.675
Captain?

07:17.810 --> 07:19.471
His Orbis deal is really happening.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.477
I heard
City Hall approved it last week.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.817
This is blackmail!

07:28.490 --> 07:30.276
It's my money. I earned it.

07:34.990 --> 07:36.367
You're such an asshole!

07:36.830 --> 07:39.288
I pay the bill.
I get to be the asshole!

07:39.410 --> 07:40.400
Exactly.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.668
You need to think about your future.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.838
Or do you want to be
like Dud and Liz?

07:46.750 --> 07:48.798
Oh, Liz, I'm sorry.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.421
No, you're right.

07:51.550 --> 07:54.508
I am the ghost
of your Shamroxx future, Alice.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.170
Beware.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.381
Ernie, I owe you an apology.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.760
That's right, bitch.

08:03.940 --> 08:07.319
I am 100% your bitch.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.602
I didn't believe you,
but here you are,

08:09.740 --> 08:11.560
ten steps ahead of everybody.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.988
The City Council, those billboards.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.691
"Is there another way to live?"
What does that even mean?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.492
I don't know, I don't care.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.282
And now you've got Captain
in the crosshairs!

08:23.420 --> 08:26.629
I am going to need
a serious expense account,

08:26.750 --> 08:30.209
so when I get to the desert
I don't look like a chump.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.910
Done and done.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.371
OK, we've got a couple more
little things.

08:35.260 --> 08:39.299
Irv Sendero
is out from Ohio next week.

08:39.429 --> 08:42.342
Your basic factory-guy jerk-off.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.847
I've set up tee times in El Dorado.

08:44.980 --> 08:48.189
Ernie, I promised him
that you would shepherd him around.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.470
-I can't. I'm going to the desert.
-What?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.099
Captain.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.857
Oh, you're right.
A little scheduling conflict.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.732
Beautiful Jeff,
how about I send you after Captain?

09:00.870 --> 09:02.326
What? No.

09:02.450 --> 09:03.781
I'd absolutely love to, Bob.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.699
Ernie, I promised Irv
that you would be his guy this trip.

09:07.830 --> 09:08.877
He loves you,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.300
and you're the only guy on the planet
who's a worse golfer than he is.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.660
You make him look good!

09:13.800 --> 09:16.713
Screw Irv!
Let Beautiful Jeff jerk him off!

09:16.840 --> 09:20.094
Well, look, here's the problem,
Ernie - I'm a scratch golfer.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.301
I can't help it.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.559
My natural stroke
is just so... smooth.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.727
-I love watching you hit.
-No!

09:27.770 --> 09:30.478
He'll never find Captain.
This is my thing.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.146
Ernie, you're off this.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.351
Stick to what you do best,

09:34.490 --> 09:36.857
and don't begrudge
another man his gifts.

09:36.990 --> 09:37.809
Understand?

09:45.370 --> 09:46.781
Just here to grab my stuff.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.780
Sure.

10:03.930 --> 10:07.889
Hey, can we talk,
in reasonable tones?

10:09.350 --> 10:10.351
Yeah.

10:11.900 --> 10:12.890
Of course.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.351
We're both sophisticated adults.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.697
I'm sorry about your foot.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.151
That's OK. It's seen worse.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.450
And I'm sorry
for escalating the situation.

10:35.090 --> 10:36.296
Where are you staying?

10:36.880 --> 10:38.041
With Larry Loomis,

10:38.180 --> 10:39.625
our Sovereign Protector.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.383
He's got some property down by
the Lodge. It's a pretty nice setup.

10:44.430 --> 10:45.761
"Sovereign Protector"?

10:46.850 --> 10:49.842
God, you're really all-in
on this Mason stuff, huh?

10:49.980 --> 10:51.300
Yeah, yeah.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.430
Except...

10:53.320 --> 10:54.640
we're the Lynx.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.270
Yeah, not the Masons.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.280
The Masons were wannabe Rosicrucians,
and Rosicrucians were a hoax

11:00.410 --> 11:02.868
that pretty much
just got out of hand.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.118
There's a great essay
by this British junkie--

11:05.240 --> 11:06.696
I'm worried about you, Sean.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.454
OK, Elizabeth serious-full-name.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.951
If Dad were here,
he'd be worried about you, too.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.165
Except he's not.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.793
Because, according to you,
Dad killed himself.

11:26.060 --> 11:31.226
Do... Do you hear how insane
that even sounds?

11:32.020 --> 11:34.307
Dud, you can't start to move on

11:34.440 --> 11:36.852
until you admit
that bad stuff has happened.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.311
I know that's hard for you.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.943
It was hard for me,
but I faced up to it.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.230
But...

11:44.740 --> 11:47.038
you've always been
afraid of the dark.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.861
Who's not afraid of the dark, Liz?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.128
At least it makes sense.
You know what doesn't make sense?

11:57.170 --> 11:58.547
Being afraid of the light.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.794
You're happy
inside your dark little witch-cave.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.130
I'm sorry, I'm not.

12:12.350 --> 12:13.897
I'm not gonna live there with you.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.617
I'm on the right path, Liz.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.860
I'm gonna prove it to you.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.668
He's embarrassed about what happened,
he just can't admit it.

12:42.090 --> 12:45.754
Well, Larry shouldn't be embarrassed.
He's got a magnificent set of balls.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.347
Yeah.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.176
He seemed so scared and frail.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.381
I mean, it just broke my heart.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.342
He's still Larry.
He just needs to slow down a little.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.518
I'm gonna try to get him
over to my place for a few nights.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.027
Yeah. You should have seen him
this morning.

13:01.150 --> 13:04.700
He was all piss and vinegar, even
after he burned off his eyebrows.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.100
What?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.652
No, he's fine.
He just looks a little crazy, so...

13:10.950 --> 13:13.783
OK, I'm sorry,
but this is a wake-up call.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.240
Larry can't be on his own any more.

13:16.370 --> 13:18.452
He needs to transition
into assisted living.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.412
-You want to put him in a home?
-Come on, Ernie.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.838
You can't pretend things are getting
better when they're getting worse.

13:25.970 --> 13:28.883
Now, look, Larry deserves
the best care possible,

13:29.010 --> 13:31.308
and I don't think any of us
can give it to him.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.640
OK.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.807
I'll talk to him.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.062
Obviously, the succession
will have to be reconsidered.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.770
This is what's on your mind now?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.196
I'm just saying!

13:49.620 --> 13:51.486
Somebody from London
will be here soon.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.282
-We can let them sort it all out.
-I can't wait for London.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.788
These emissaries have
the coolest gig ever.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.957
They live like rock stars.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.587
Mum, Dad, I'm leaving.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.717
I'm going now!

14:10.550 --> 14:11.881
To California.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.017
I've told you a million...

14:20.650 --> 14:21.970
This is the endgame.

14:23.020 --> 14:25.899
The corporate-industrial dragon
has poisoned itself,

14:26.030 --> 14:28.237
gorging on the flesh of its workers,

14:28.360 --> 14:30.522
leaving the vultures
to pick the bones.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.276
That's a bummer.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.037
Que sera, bro.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.616
You can't turn back time.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.452
-This is where we are.
-Yeah.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.834
So, you work all day at Shamroxx,
and then you work all night here?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.088
-When do you sleep?
-I don't sleep.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.376
We're all gonna be
replaced by robots,

14:46.510 --> 14:50.048
so the only way to survive
is to become a robot.

14:52.470 --> 14:56.634
You know, I never really saw myself
working in law enforcement,

14:56.770 --> 14:59.057
but, I've got to say,
I kind of dig the uniform.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.430
It's all theater.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.430
What do you mean?

15:03.320 --> 15:06.062
I mean don't take any dumb risks.

15:06.190 --> 15:09.069
You see or hear anything,

15:09.200 --> 15:10.349
run the other way.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.778
“Let the vultures feed" -
that's my policing philosophy.

15:15.990 --> 15:16.991
OK.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.086
It's late.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.668
Yeah. Any tips for staying awake?

15:28.720 --> 15:32.088
Late in the epoch
of post-industrial capitalism.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.291
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That, too.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.710
See?

15:37.850 --> 15:38.840
Yeah.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.841
It's finally quiet enough to hear.

15:42.940 --> 15:44.476
-What?
-You hear it?

15:46.690 --> 15:48.180
-You hear it?
-No, I can't hear--

15:52.450 --> 15:55.192
The din of our suffering
drowns it out, but...

15:56.120 --> 15:59.499
here, in the silence
of death and ruin...

16:00.460 --> 16:03.418
you can hear the one thing
that history can't kill,

16:03.540 --> 16:05.588
the one thing that can never die.

16:06.630 --> 16:07.836
Hope.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.950
No.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.252
Hope died with truth.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.040
Listen.

16:20.390 --> 16:21.380
Yeah.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.051
-Yeah, it's a heart.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:24.190 --> 16:25.726
Oh, my God. I can hear it.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.931
Yeah, the coeur de la bte.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.140
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.817
-Yeah. What does that mean?
-"The heart of the beast."

16:31.950 --> 16:33.600
-"Heart of the beast."
-Yeah.

16:33.740 --> 16:37.233
-Is that from something, or is it...?
-Yeah, I read it somewhere. I forget.

16:38.030 --> 16:41.284
As for staying up all night, that's
really just a matter of willpower.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.110
And speed.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.837
Here come the nice.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.081
-Here.
-No, that's OK.

16:54.090 --> 16:55.797
Is there somewhere we can get coffee?

16:57.180 --> 16:58.295
No!

16:58.430 --> 17:00.216
Larry, just think about it.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.267
It might not be so bad.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.050
Assisted living?

17:05.690 --> 17:08.261
They're going to ask me if I asked
you, so I have to ask you.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.563
No, I've got a plan.
Yeah, I'm going on a little trip.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.520
What are you talking about?

17:13.650 --> 17:16.654
Well, I've been setting it up
ever since I left the hospital.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.321
Yeah, I've got this buddy.

17:19.450 --> 17:22.329
I mean, OK,
I don't know his real name.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.743
But in Guadalajara,
they call him "El Confidente."

17:27.170 --> 17:29.081
It means "The Confident One," right?

17:29.210 --> 17:31.918
He's coming tomorrow to pick me up.

17:32.050 --> 17:35.463
We've got some business
to take care of across the border.

17:36.220 --> 17:39.008
I need to find something that I lost.

17:40.010 --> 17:41.637
It was a long time ago.

17:46.770 --> 17:47.760
What?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.609
-El Confidente? Come on!
-Look, look. Come on, trust me, man.

17:52.690 --> 17:53.771
I'll be fine.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.655
And I will have some amazing news
when I get back.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.691
Something big is coming, Ernie.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.150
Can't wait.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.241
All right. OK, OK.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.663
Yeah, I've made some pretty big
screw-ups during my reign.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.490
But if I can get this right...

18:13.800 --> 18:15.370
it will make up for a lot.

18:17.090 --> 18:18.216
And I tell you...

18:18.890 --> 18:22.758
there's no one I'd rather have
taking over the Lodge right now.

18:25.770 --> 18:26.931
It's a new dawn.

18:29.190 --> 18:30.180
You know what?

18:30.730 --> 18:32.516
Hey, let's just knock it out here.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.317
The ceremony don't mean crap.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.158
-Now?
-Well, why wait?

18:41.910 --> 18:42.900
Come on.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.440
Take a knee.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.321
Come on, take a knee. Take a knee.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.505
By the power of the Ancient
and Benevolent Order of the Lynx,

18:58.630 --> 19:00.041
I hereby attest...

19:01.430 --> 19:03.842
that it is with an open heart
and clear vision...

19:05.470 --> 19:07.723
that I pass
the power of the office...

19:08.980 --> 19:13.304
of Sovereign Protector
of Lynx Lodge 49...

19:14.320 --> 19:15.856
Long Beach, California...

19:16.900 --> 19:18.356
to the Luminous Knight...

19:19.400 --> 19:20.481
Ernie Fontaine.

19:22.910 --> 19:24.446
The unseen...

19:26.160 --> 19:27.491
is seen...

19:29.410 --> 19:30.821
with righteous eyes.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.120
As above...

19:39.470 --> 19:41.211
so below.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.265
Well, that's it.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.020
Congrats.

20:01.030 --> 20:04.113
Where's the remote?
I must be losing my mind.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.691
Stone saw the flash first,

20:07.830 --> 20:10.868
then the wave of dust and concrete
hit, throwing him back,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.786
his head hitting
the Maserati's grille

20:12.920 --> 20:14.820
with enough force to make a dent.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.587
He'd grown up with explosives--

20:18.340 --> 20:19.546
What's in Mexico?

20:20.840 --> 20:21.921
He won't say.

20:22.630 --> 20:25.349
We're supposed to rendezvous
with this El Confidente guy.

20:25.470 --> 20:28.679
The rendezvous with El Confidente?

20:30.180 --> 20:34.094
So... did you come
because you've made a decision?

20:34.770 --> 20:37.182
No, I came because you wanted
to talk about Larry.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.391
-This is stupid.
-You messed everything up.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.520
How?

20:41.030 --> 20:42.850
You want to know the future.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.903
It's just got to be what it is.
I can't give you more.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.532
If you want to be with me,
be with me.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.861
Stop worrying about what's next.

20:56.830 --> 20:57.831
OK.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.586
I'm with you.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.753
Right here, right now.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.565
So... So...

21:23.490 --> 21:25.060
Everyone was impressed?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.315
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.236
Yeah, your balls were a hit.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.519
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.281
Big hit.

21:31.740 --> 21:32.741
Hey.

21:33.870 --> 21:35.247
I have something for you.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.621
Yeah.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.628
This is my old squire kit.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.466
I want you to have it.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.636
A squire kit?

21:52.720 --> 21:53.721
-Larry...
-Yeah.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.932
The Lynx discontinued them.

21:56.390 --> 21:59.894
Too expensive and... you know,
not enough people joining.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.476
-Pretty neat, huh?
-Yeah.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.226
That's my old Zippo.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.560
Stopped a bullet with that
in Vietham.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.606
-Oh, really?
-Not really, no.

22:08.570 --> 22:11.232
This is... Larry, this is amazing.

22:11.370 --> 22:12.986
I mean... Thank you.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.497
Thank you so much.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.150
Yeah.

22:16.290 --> 22:19.578
-So, where are we meeting your guy?
-I'll tell you when you need to know.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.450
OK.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.621
-Care for some peanuts?
-No, thank you.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.967
OK. Would you like anything?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.507
Are you from California?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.261
The Golden State.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.397
This will be my first visit.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.483
I'm an administrator
with The Ancient and...

22:46.990 --> 22:47.980
Oh, dear.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.315
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:50.450 --> 22:52.908
the seat-belt sign
has been switched on.

22:53.030 --> 22:55.158
Return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.940
Is this place always this empty?

22:57.660 --> 23:00.914
No. This is just
the three o'clock doldrums.

23:01.710 --> 23:02.871
Well, it's perfect.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.799
I'm going through
some personal issues.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.587
I needed some place
to think things through.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.422
Why would you come here to think?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.472
There are so many TVs,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.843
and we keep them
at full volume at all times,

23:20.980 --> 23:22.550
even if there's not a game on.

23:22.690 --> 23:23.509
It's horrible.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.930
You know what the worst part is?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.988
I don't even notice it any more.

23:29.110 --> 23:32.193
I'll just be walking around,
taking orders, and...

23:33.320 --> 23:35.732
for whatever reason,
I'll kind of wake up,

23:35.870 --> 23:41.240
and I'll hear the Viagra commercials
blaring on ESPN and just feel like...

23:44.790 --> 23:45.951
I'll get your rum.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.415
What is he driving?

23:52.050 --> 23:53.211
It's been some time.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.130
It used to be a big, red van

23:55.260 --> 23:59.094
with a mythical sea beast
airbrushed on the side.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.344
It was part-tiger,
it was part-mermaid... part-unicorn.

24:03.730 --> 24:05.107
He did it himself.

24:05.230 --> 24:06.470
It was glorious.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.357
Do you guys mind
if I just go lie down?

24:09.490 --> 24:13.358
-I've got this sleep-deficit thing.
-Sure. When are you coming back?

24:13.490 --> 24:16.619
I don't know. I'll send a postcard
when we know what we're looking at.

24:16.740 --> 24:19.368
Are you sure
you're really up for all this, Larry?

24:20.410 --> 24:22.321
There he is. Yeah!

24:23.210 --> 24:24.245
Listen, listen.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.798
That kid... is special.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.337
He is connected to the True Lodge.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.790
He just doesn't know it.

24:49.980 --> 24:50.981
Not him.

24:54.490 --> 24:57.778
Thank you for flying with us today.
Please make sure to take...

24:57.910 --> 25:01.403
No, that's what I'm trying to tell
you. I don't have my passport.

25:01.540 --> 25:03.360
The child that did... this

25:03.500 --> 25:07.073
must have taken it off my person
while I was asleep,

25:07.210 --> 25:09.998
along with my phone and my wallet.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.508
I need your passport.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.884
Have you not heard a word I've said?
What is wrong with you, sir?

25:16.840 --> 25:18.171
Secondary inspection.

25:23.350 --> 25:24.260
Hey.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.940
Well, El Confidente didn't show.

25:29.270 --> 25:30.351
I'm shocked.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.068
So, I've been thinking
about this morning.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.402
I feel like I'm fooling myself.

25:37.780 --> 25:41.990
I don't want to be your escape
from your real life, or whatever.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.955
We used to hide from your folks,
sneaking around.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.126
I feel like nothing's changed.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.837
I know I think too much,

25:54.970 --> 25:58.008
but I can't live in the moment.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.426
You have to.

25:59.550 --> 26:00.540
I can't.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.090
OK.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.930
So...

26:08.600 --> 26:09.601
Yeah.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.822
Welcome back, folks, to the...

26:22.990 --> 26:25.618
Buy, trade, or sell!

26:27.580 --> 26:28.570
Dud?

26:30.210 --> 26:31.029
God!

26:36.590 --> 26:38.718
-Hey.
-I left you a couple of messages.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.217
Oh, I was asleep.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.007
I just want to say I'm sorry
for what my dad said.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.347
If it makes you feel better,
he feels awful,

26:45.470 --> 26:47.802
and you can guilt him
into free donuts for life.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.760
Don't worry about it, seriously.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.187
Did you come out here
just to tell me that?

26:56.280 --> 26:58.021
Yeah, that's all.

26:58.490 --> 27:01.733
I mean, my home life
is kind of treacherous right now.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.862
I'm just sort of driving around,
feeling lonely

27:04.990 --> 27:06.992
and misunderstood by society.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.952
Jesus. Come in, if you want.

27:09.370 --> 27:10.576
What are you watching?

27:12.840 --> 27:13.989
Just crap.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.122
Oh-hundred hours:
The perimeter is clear.

27:18.260 --> 27:20.001
Do you copy what I just said?

27:20.430 --> 27:24.003
Yes, I copy it. Do you copy what
I'm saying right now about copying?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.301
Copy that, copy that.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.973
He is just a mountain of a man,
and came out here...

27:29.100 --> 27:32.513
These Scandinavian bastards
are so full of themselves.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.267
I could pull a truck with my teeth
if I wanted to.

27:35.690 --> 27:37.226
No way. It's all core strength.

27:37.780 --> 27:38.770
You've got none.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.652
I can tell by the way you stand -
you and your brother.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.361
Let's look at the highlights.

27:44.490 --> 27:45.980
Go!

27:46.120 --> 27:47.531
You're so weak!

27:47.660 --> 27:49.116
You suck at this!

27:49.250 --> 27:50.786
You have no core!

27:50.920 --> 27:52.319
You have no core!

28:01.630 --> 28:03.132
Seven years of bad luck.

28:04.970 --> 28:06.881
Well, too late for that, huh?

28:11.640 --> 28:12.641
Liz?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.087
Champ? Champ?

28:36.790 --> 28:37.791
Come in.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.250
Let's go!

28:55.230 --> 28:56.220
Champ.

28:56.650 --> 28:57.765
Champ.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.720
Champ, wake up. Champ, wake up.

29:30.220 --> 29:31.631
When the hell did you get here?

29:33.140 --> 29:34.722
We have things to discuss.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.140
Are you alone?

29:37.860 --> 29:38.679
Yeah.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.936
I was closing up.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.391
And we do need to talk.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.441
After today, Larry...

29:49.120 --> 29:52.238
I was thinking
maybe we could get you a nice place

29:52.370 --> 29:54.281
with good people looking out for you.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.706
Come on.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.379
It's time for you to see
the Sanctum Sanctorum.

30:08.590 --> 30:09.591
Ta-da!

30:20.560 --> 30:22.107
This is where it all happens.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.938
The nerve center
of the living universe.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.310
It's your grass shack now.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.019
Make it your own.

30:33.450 --> 30:34.440
I will.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.161
Have a seat.

30:39.290 --> 30:40.872
It's Mysteries time.

30:57.270 --> 30:58.260
Hey.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.390
Hey.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.022
It's not... It's not cool. Just...

31:16.950 --> 31:17.951
Hey!

31:18.500 --> 31:19.490
Get him!

31:37.770 --> 31:38.976
I'm gonna bust you up!

31:52.200 --> 31:55.659
Now, we all know the story
of Harwood Fritz Merrill.

31:55.780 --> 31:59.785
He fights in the Crimea, finds solace
in the philosophy of alchemy,

31:59.910 --> 32:01.992
then founds the Lynx
to share his experience.

32:02.120 --> 32:06.489
But... we also have
the myth of Merrill, huh?

32:06.630 --> 32:08.337
The one that's in all the pamphlets?

32:08.840 --> 32:11.628
"After the war,
Merrill wanders the world

32:11.760 --> 32:14.468
until he finds the ancient scrolls
in the desert."

32:14.600 --> 32:16.750
The Holy Grail, baby.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.597
All the secrets of alchemy.

32:19.730 --> 32:23.394
Now, what I'm telling you is
that he actually found those scrolls

32:23.520 --> 32:25.932
and completed the Magnum Opus.

32:26.730 --> 32:30.109
Then he buried the scrolls
under Lodge 1 in London.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.029
But... he had to keep this a secret,
so what he did...

32:35.120 --> 32:36.770
was tell everyone all about it.

32:38.450 --> 32:39.281
What?

32:39.410 --> 32:42.323
Yes, if you want to hide the fact
that you're an alchemist,

32:42.460 --> 32:44.827
the best thing to do is tell everyone
you're one.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.667
No one will take you seriously.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.752
The true alchemist
is disguised as himself,

32:49.880 --> 32:52.167
so Merrill tells everyone the myth,

32:52.300 --> 32:53.677
and they love it!

32:54.760 --> 32:56.967
Lodges start opening up all over,

32:57.100 --> 32:58.306
and it's a great thing.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.421
It does help people.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.227
It gives them a sense of something...

33:03.890 --> 33:07.554
bigger and rosier
than grinding it out until you die.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.937
So, the inner-circle -

33:11.070 --> 33:12.276
the True Lodge.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.811
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.816
Merrill tells a few people.

33:15.950 --> 33:20.615
The other lodge behind the lodge
that keeps the scrolls safe.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.202
And they keep them hidden...

33:25.420 --> 33:27.377
by hiding nothing.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.759
No, no, no. This is real, Ernie.
You've got to believe me.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.047
I believe you believe it, Larry.

33:34.630 --> 33:35.620
No, man.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.097
You don't understand.

33:40.220 --> 33:41.346
The scrolls.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.221
I held them in my hands.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.224
They were in my old bowling bag
for 12 years. They were this big!

33:50.270 --> 33:52.147
-They smelled like eggplant!
-OK.

33:53.320 --> 33:54.640
These scrolls...

33:55.450 --> 33:57.066
how did they end up in Long Beach?

33:57.700 --> 34:00.988
Well, my mom, God bless her soul,

34:01.120 --> 34:03.031
was banging the Sovereign Protector,

34:03.160 --> 34:05.208
that suck-nut Wallace Smith.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.914
Everyone knew it. They wore out
the mattress in the Sentinel Suite.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.871
Lodge scandals, man.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.337
They took a trip to London together.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.757
"Lodge business," they said.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.672
A few months after they got back,

34:19.800 --> 34:21.507
Wallace left town.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.677
I didn't know he was upstairs.

34:24.770 --> 34:27.933
All I knew is I had my mom back.
At least, I thought I did.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.643
Over the next few years, she started
getting weird and paranoid,

34:31.770 --> 34:33.226
and then she got sick.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.141
And this is right after
I got out of the Army.

34:37.860 --> 34:41.524
And towards the end, she told me
everything I'm telling you now.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.402
That she and Wallace
had infiltrated the True Lodge.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.702
That they broke into
Merrill's crypt in London...

34:50.670 --> 34:51.989
took the scrolls...

34:52.670 --> 34:54.661
and brought them back to Long Beach.

34:56.670 --> 34:58.172
I know I sound like a loon.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.428
This stuff is supposed
to sound crazy.

35:00.550 --> 35:03.099
That's how it works.
I mean, I didn't believe any of it!

35:03.850 --> 35:06.262
When she gave me the scrolls,
I thought it was old junk.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.479
I thought she made it all up
to justify her affair...

35:11.440 --> 35:12.976
and leaving me behind.

35:17.780 --> 35:18.770
Larry?

35:20.070 --> 35:21.151
Can I see them?

35:21.780 --> 35:22.770
No.

35:25.830 --> 35:29.073
I lost them in a poker game in '82.

35:31.670 --> 35:34.412
You lost the Holy Grail of alchemy
in a poker game?

35:35.670 --> 35:38.298
El Confidente cleaned me out.

35:39.970 --> 35:41.426
I had nothing else to give.

35:42.930 --> 35:45.388
I showed him the scrolls,

35:45.510 --> 35:46.887
and he took them.

35:47.350 --> 35:50.012
He said he knew an antiquities dealer
in Guadalajara.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.142
Then he took off in his tiger van,

35:52.270 --> 35:54.227
and we hadn't talked since, until...

35:54.900 --> 35:56.390
a few weeks ago.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.027
So why do you believe your mom now?

36:01.780 --> 36:03.066
Because of Dud.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.908
Know your Lynx history, Ernie!

36:09.250 --> 36:10.570
Merrill was an orphan.

36:11.460 --> 36:14.623
He found the scrolls when he fell
into the viper pit in Egypt.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.127
Got bit, but survived.

36:16.710 --> 36:17.791
Sound familiar?

36:19.590 --> 36:21.376
They sent Dud as a message.

36:22.510 --> 36:25.002
Larry, anything can be a message.

37:06.550 --> 37:07.881
It's all coming due.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.762
I need to get down to the border
ASAP. You have to take me.

37:13.890 --> 37:14.891
Stop!

37:15.020 --> 37:17.307
I can't let you go down to Mexico.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.026
I don't have much time left.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.449
And I'm not gonna spend it like
a chump in a nursing home.

37:26.490 --> 37:27.867
If I'm crazy, fine...

37:29.160 --> 37:30.787
but I'm going down swinging.

37:30.910 --> 37:32.287
Larry...

37:32.750 --> 37:34.957
I told you the Lodge
would give you a gift.

37:36.290 --> 37:37.280
It has.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.495
It gave me one, too.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.546
The scrolls?

37:45.380 --> 37:47.883
No, you... you blockhead.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.801
I mean you.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.590
Please.

37:59.730 --> 38:00.856
Just let me go.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.822
...actually said that to him.

38:14.830 --> 38:16.616
Yes! Can you believe it?

38:17.330 --> 38:19.287
I would never have the nerve
to say that.

38:19.790 --> 38:20.780
Me neither.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.800
Just down at that table at the end.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.390
Dud?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.270
The doctor wants to talk to you
before you go.

38:55.910 --> 38:57.321
You don't have to wait.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.280
-I don't care.
-No, go.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.457
I don't get what they have
to talk to me about.

39:01.590 --> 39:02.705
It's the cut.

39:07.090 --> 39:08.251
Oh, God.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.137
They're gonna tell you
to talk to somebody.

39:13.390 --> 39:15.768
See, Alice?
Your dad was right. I'm a mess.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.886
Don't end up like me.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.055
I don't care.

39:20.770 --> 39:23.262
You moved a couch.
That was incredible.

39:25.820 --> 39:28.198
The sun's gonna be up soon.
I'm gonna get into water.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.310
Yeah, go.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.728
Hi, Corporate Guy from Corporate.

40:01.850 --> 40:03.727
This is Liz Dudley from...

40:04.230 --> 40:06.062
Well, you know who I am.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.567
You had mentioned a--

40:10.820 --> 40:12.356
Oh, you're calling me back.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.150
Hi.

40:15.620 --> 40:18.328
Yeah, I was just leaving you
a message.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.110
Yeah. So, that...

40:23.000 --> 40:26.550
that executive program
you were talking about.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.333
Is that still in play and...

40:31.090 --> 40:34.048
So sorry. Is it crazy late or early?

40:34.180 --> 40:35.966
Did I wake you up
with this dumb call?

40:37.310 --> 40:40.132
No, I was laying awake in bed,
too, sort of.

40:58.620 --> 40:59.655
Hi. May I help you?

40:59.790 --> 41:00.996
I think so.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.282
You wouldn't happen to be
from London?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.873
I am indeed.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.258
Is there room at the inn?

41:11.380 --> 41:14.793
Yes. You must be the emissary.
We've been expecting you.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.428
Follow me upstairs.
I'll show you our Sentinel Suite.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.925
-Thank you.
-Allow me.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.349
Ernie, where the hell did you send
Beautiful Jeff?

41:25.480 --> 41:26.891
What are you talking about?

41:27.400 --> 41:30.472
He left for the desert yesterday
and I haven't heard from him!

41:30.610 --> 41:32.180
He's not answering his phone!

41:32.860 --> 41:34.817
Will you calm down?
Everything is fine.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.611
Get to the office now!

41:36.740 --> 41:39.323
I can't. I've got
more important stuff going on.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.229
I'll check in later.

41:42.910 --> 41:43.957
Are you OK?

41:45.540 --> 41:46.666
Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.530
Yeah. Do you mind
if we stop by the Lodge?

41:49.670 --> 41:51.752
I want to get a few things
from the Sanctum.

41:52.170 --> 41:56.004
And, oh, man, I could sure use a beer
before we hit the road.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.539
Yeah.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.717
Anyway, I'm on my way down the hill,

42:01.850 --> 42:04.933
and I run into a medic named Cardona.

42:05.060 --> 42:08.644
I mean,
I think he's from Modesto or Merced.

42:08.770 --> 42:12.229
Anyway, he's also carrying
a roll of toilet paper, man.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.239
So, we team up,
looking for a peaceful setting

42:15.360 --> 42:18.523
where we can take a dump
and discuss the meaning of life.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.573
And, hey, down below,
there's a couple of infantry guys

42:21.700 --> 42:24.078
setting up a gun position
at the edge of a cornfield.

42:24.200 --> 42:28.285
So we walk down there
and ask them not to shoot us

42:28.420 --> 42:30.661
while we're in the corn,
taking care of business.

42:32.000 --> 42:32.831
So...

42:32.960 --> 42:34.166
So, after a few minutes,

42:34.300 --> 42:37.008
we're smoking and joking
without a care in the world,

42:37.130 --> 42:41.499
and then little pieces of corn
start falling down all around us,

42:41.640 --> 42:43.961
and we hear this muffled
automatic weapon's fire,

42:44.100 --> 42:46.171
and somebody up the hill yells,

42:46.310 --> 42:47.300
"Incoming!"

43:02.530 --> 43:03.577
Son of a bitch.

43:04.490 --> 43:05.946
Hey, don't worry.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.741
I'll jump you.

43:08.330 --> 43:09.320
All right.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.643
There was a boy

43:33.770 --> 43:38.856
A very strange, enchanted boy

43:39.360 --> 43:43.240
They say he wandered very far

43:43.370 --> 43:44.769
Very far

43:44.910 --> 43:46.071
Good to go!

43:46.200 --> 43:49.750
Over land and sea

43:50.500 --> 43:56.166
A little shy and sad of eye

43:56.300 --> 44:00.965
But very wise was he

44:01.550 --> 44:04.463
And then, one day

44:04.890 --> 44:10.385
One magic day, he passed my way

44:10.520 --> 44:14.935
And though we spoke of many things

44:15.070 --> 44:17.812
Fools and kings

44:17.940 --> 44:22.559
This he said to me

44:23.240 --> 44:29.077
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn

44:29.660 --> 44:32.914
Is just to love

44:33.380 --> 44:35.667
And be loved

44:36.420 --> 44:40.960
In return
