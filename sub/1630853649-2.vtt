But there are other ways
to commune.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.790
And that is
when I told Lucy,

04:49.873 --> 04:51.959
"No goddaughter of mine
should ever worry

04:52.042 --> 04:54.837
about getting mud

04:59.258 --> 05:00.843
All right.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.928
I got one.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.263
- Hell no.
- What do you mean, no?

05:04.346 --> 05:05.931
No, you're banned from this.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.474
Banned from what?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.101
These are remembrances.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.102
You want him silenced?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.353
I'll choke his ass out
right now.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.855
- Don't worry.

05:12.938 --> 05:13.981
I'll be good.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.152
So, back when I was
in the teams,

05:18.235 --> 05:19.570
after every op,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.656
Lauren and Reece would hold
these amazing barbecues.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.658
And this one time...

05:24.742 --> 05:26.410
I think it was...

05:26.493 --> 05:30.039
right after Sabrina
had just left me officially...

05:30.122 --> 05:31.665
Uh, which wife was this?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.503
- I was not in the best
of headspaces.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.880
And like a good friend,

05:37.963 --> 05:40.299
Reece bought, what,
four or five cases of beer?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.718
I think I had
four or five cases of beer.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.262
End of the night rolls in.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.014
Everyone's leaving.
I look over there,

05:47.097 --> 05:50.184
and there's this amazing,
pristine red couch

05:50.267 --> 05:53.270
just fucking calling my name.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.481
I, of course,
bed down for the night.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.024

it's the morning.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.901
Way too fucking early.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.740

06:07.409 --> 06:08.911
And there's...

06:11.163 --> 06:13.749
There's Laur
holding little Luce...

your SIG P226,

that was taken out of a gun safe

Thank you.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.593
I was mainly curious--

11:58.677 --> 12:01.430
how do you think these assassins
got into your safe?

12:01.513 --> 12:03.181

12:38.258 --> 12:40.385
that the gun was stowed
in this safe...

12:40.469 --> 12:42.554

12:48.560 --> 12:50.020
I tell you,
NCIS was always happy

12:50.103 --> 12:52.105
to make quick work when one
of my boys got in a bar fight.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.773
I'm gonna tell you something.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.775
You missed it on Boozer.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.987
He didn't kill himself.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.530
All right? If I was downrange,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.616
- I'd be busting
fucking doors down...
- Commander.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.494
- ...pulling people out

- Commander.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.329

that you're in here.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.622
I truly do.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.998
But we are not downrange,

13:10.081 --> 13:11.666
and there's a process back home.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.212
All right.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.809
I'm meeting with the admiral.
I called ahead.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.020
- Reece. Come on in.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.821
Beautiful funeral.

Hopefully our last for a while.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.991
Yes, sir.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.619
Something you wanted to discuss?

13:47.702 --> 13:50.038
NCIS, sir.

13:50.121 --> 13:53.667
I'm not sure they're qualified
to handle this case.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.087
I was told the inquiry
into Odin's Sword was complete

13:57.170 --> 13:58.713
and that you agreed
that it was Mitchell

13:58.797 --> 14:00.131
- who set off the IED.
- No.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.716
I'm talking about my family.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.928
The case is
in Criminal Investigation.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.429
Should be Counterintel.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.848
I believe what's happening
may be personal.

14:08.932 --> 14:09.849
Personal?

14:09.933 --> 14:12.102
I've been tracking Kahani
for years.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.521
There's no one better
to put him down.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.731
He and Quds know that.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.776
Son, Jahan Kahani
is not working in Coronado.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.778
The man's a chemist,
not a spymaster.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.114
He sent a kill squad
after Boozer.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.198
After me.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.410
Whoever killed my family
is still out there,

14:28.493 --> 14:30.954
and the entire community
is at risk.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.542
You're...
clearly speaking freely,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.168

14:41.840 --> 14:45.510
You're putting us
in an untenable position here.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.720
Two weeks ago,

14:46.803 --> 14:48.221
you came in insisting,

14:48.305 --> 14:50.056
despite evidence
to the contrary,

14:50.140 --> 14:53.560
that an SDF trooper
set off the IEDs in Syria.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.145
I have since recanted that, sir.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.814
After we went to the mat
for you.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.734
Now you want us to, what,

15:00.817 --> 15:04.279
get into a scuffle with NCIS
over some harebrained notion

15:04.362 --> 15:06.281
that Quds Force
is picking off SEALs

15:06.364 --> 15:08.533
- right under our noses?
- Sir. Sir,
you're not listening to me.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.827
You're not listening
to yourself, Commander.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.748
Now, we got you out
of the Odin's Sword inquiry

15:14.831 --> 15:16.708
with a job intact.

15:16.791 --> 15:20.378
Hell, Captain Howard
has made a full-time job

15:20.462 --> 15:22.797
out of covering your six.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.299
But the truth is,

15:24.382 --> 15:26.718
we just don't know
what's going on with you.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.180
And given the fact
that you couldn't protect

15:30.263 --> 15:32.015
your men nor your family,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.933
- we can't...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.019

Katie Buranek, VoltStreem.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.459
The liaison's office
said I could meet you here.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.669
No, they didn't.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.962
I spoke with Brenda Freeman.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.381
If Brenda told you anything,

16:04.464 --> 16:05.882
it's that NCIS
doesn't allow reporters

16:05.965 --> 16:07.342
anywhere near our crime scenes.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.469
Well, I was with Commander Reece
the day before the killings,

16:09.552 --> 16:11.388
and he waved a gun in my face.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.973
You want a witness statement,
it's yours,

16:14.057 --> 16:15.892

or after he arrived?

16:29.155 --> 16:32.367
That's unclear, but it's
well within the margin of error.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.828
Meaning someone either
killed them after he left,

16:34.911 --> 16:39.207
or Reece could have done
his family and then come here.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.334

he seemed off.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.787
Well, there's no body.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.873
And according to Reece,
he left one of his assailants

17:19.956 --> 17:23.001
lying right here
in a pool of blood.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.253
Shot him three times.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.297
Could somebody have
cleaned up the evidence?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.507
I was first on the scene.
I saw no indication

attackers, living or dead.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.014
All right, well, does the
clinic have security cameras?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.308
No. Client confidentiality.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.143
What about forensics?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.644
None,
except for the bullets

17:41.728 --> 17:43.521

own nine millimeter.

All right, so why
is he walking free?

Because none of this
makes any sense.

wound, I don't have a knife.

No, he's an NCIS agent.
The only thing he wants

34:17.347 --> 34:20.017
And then, somehow you land
the biggest story of the year.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.603
- Yeah, 'cause I'm good
at my job.
- And then you go dark.

34:22.686 --> 34:25.981
Meanwhile, I have to get updates
on James Reece on ABC7?

34:27.733 --> 34:30.736
Well, ABC7 doesn't have a signed
medical release from him.

34:34.948 --> 34:36.158
Tell me.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.788
There are some questions
about Reece's mental capacity.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.248
I'm just waiting on the police
to turn over the crime scene.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.921
Did he do it?
He kill the family?

34:49.004 --> 34:51.131
That's what I'm working on.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.468
You know,
I named my ulcer after you.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.471
- Ulcer Katie.
- You worry too much.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.140
Right.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.059
Listen, you're good
at impact work, right?

35:02.142 --> 35:03.977
And I'm done sitting on this.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.897
- VoltStreem's biggest
advantage is immediacy.
- Yeah.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.899
So, you've got 24 hours,
then I want something I can run.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.192
Okay?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.946
Yeah, she's got this.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.798
Rabbit's on the move.
I'll let you know if he 180s.

Hey, brother.

Look, uh, your friend
is waiting in the back for you.

39:42.339 --> 39:44.758
Madam Secretary.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.093
Commander.

39:47.511 --> 39:49.554
I heard about what happened
at WARCOM.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.390
You're not helping your case
assaulting an admiral.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.601
Isn't busting down SEALs
a little below your pay grade?

39:54.684 --> 39:56.061
I'm not busting you down.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.647
Gerry can be a hell
of a blowhard.

40:01.108 --> 40:03.318
Wasn't your father a SEAL?

40:03.401 --> 40:06.238
Yes, ma'am.

40:06.321 --> 40:09.074
It's a special pride,
a military childhood,

40:09.157 --> 40:11.201
but also a special burden.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.704
You drink Irish, Commander?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.833
I'm not too picky these days.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.760
Rick?

40:28.844 --> 40:30.887
Can you bring us a pair
of Yellow Spots, please?

40:30.971 --> 40:32.180
Yes, ma'am.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.852
You know,
the SEALs developed

40:36.935 --> 40:38.770
some of their hit-and-run
assault tactics

40:38.854 --> 40:41.857
using Army helicopters.

40:41.940 --> 40:46.111
Imagine the coincidence,
if your father, a young SEAL,

40:46.194 --> 40:49.114
and my father, a veteran pilot,
crossed paths?

40:49.197 --> 40:51.074
My father hated to fly, ma'am.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.536
Maybe it's because he flew
with mine.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.414
Ma'am.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.333
It's on the house.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.714
Did WARCOM talk to you
about my theory?

41:06.965 --> 41:08.633
Kahani?

41:08.717 --> 41:11.303
He didn't just feed us
a line of bullshit in Syria.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.972
I have reason to believe
he has at least one asset

41:14.055 --> 41:17.017
inside NCIS San Diego.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.812
Beyond that, I don't know,
but we need to act on this.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.939
And now, to make sure my platoon

41:23.023 --> 41:24.649
- is the only one he can get to.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.027
Kahani is not
a threat to you, Commander.

41:27.110 --> 41:30.238
- Ma'am,
we don't know that.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.282
Rick, turn the news on.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.410
We do, in fact.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.579
Iranian weapons
specialist Dr. Jahan Kahani

41:37.662 --> 41:39.748
was killed in an elite
U.S. military operation

41:39.831 --> 41:41.708
conducted in northern Syria.

41:41.791 --> 41:45.045
This attack comes just weeks
after a failed mission

41:45.128 --> 41:48.548
to capture Kahani resulted
in the death of 12 Navy SEALs.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.300
The Pentagon released
the following statement:

41:50.383 --> 41:52.552
"The world,
especially the Syrian people,

41:52.636 --> 41:54.471
can sleep soundly knowing
that one of the Middle East's

41:54.554 --> 41:56.473
top chemical weapons experts

41:56.556 --> 41:58.350
is no longer a threat
to those who value freedom."

42:07.400 --> 42:10.779
I know what it's like
when war follows you home,

42:10.862 --> 42:12.948
but I hope you'll be able
to find peace

42:13.031 --> 42:15.951
knowing this mission is over.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.955
Good night, Commander.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.218
Investigations are still
ongoing into the failures

42:33.301 --> 42:36.054
of the prior attempt,
Operation Odin's Sword.

42:48.650 --> 42:49.818
Yo.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.027
What? You got something?

42:51.111 --> 42:52.737
- Yes.

42:52.821 --> 42:56.574
Our boy pulled your biometrics
out of the team database.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.243
Yeah, that makes sense.
I'm his lead suspect.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.662
Except Holder pulled
your prints two days

43:00.745 --> 43:03.373
before the fucking murders.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.126
He could be our guy.

43:09.629 --> 43:10.839

43:15.093 --> 43:17.137
Knife wound, left forearm.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.972
Yep.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.433
Brought you something.

43:32.777 --> 43:35.071

43:35.155 --> 43:36.573
And Boozer.

43:52.505 --> 43:54.341
Hey, there.

43:54.424 --> 43:55.550
- Are you
with the police?
- No.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.177
I'm press. I called earlier

43:57.260 --> 44:00.055
- about James Reece's
brain scan.
- Yeah, I replied.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.015
We need to assign
a new doctor to the case

44:02.098 --> 44:03.183
before we release
any information.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.560
Oh, I kind of need it yesterday.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.488
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.215
Hey, Jordan.

44:35.298 --> 44:36.841
Yeah, I fucking got it.

44:36.925 --> 44:39.094
No, no, no, listen. I need you
to find me a neurologist

44:39.177 --> 44:41.513
up in L.A. right now.

- No, Commander,
I didn't kill anyone.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.619
- Show me your arms.
- I didn't kill anyone.

47:51.703 --> 47:54.455
Show me your arms.

48:01.379 --> 48:03.381
Turn your left arm over.

48:09.596 --> 48:11.222

Okay.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.650
Okay.

48:24.652 --> 48:28.615
Maybe you didn't kill them,
but you covered it up.

48:28.698 --> 48:29.824
Who do you work for?

48:29.907 --> 48:32.493
Put your fucking hands in.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.167
I asked you a question.

48:42.629 --> 48:44.589
Don't fucking cry.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.633

48:46.716 --> 48:47.925

Don't you fucking make me
ask you again.

This is getting boring, boss.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.824

49:11.908 --> 49:14.202

who are you talking to?

49:43.898 --> 49:45.733
Listen, okay? Just listen.

49:45.817 --> 49:47.402
I'll-I'll... I won't charge you.

49:47.485 --> 49:50.405
I-I'll just... it all goes away.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.949
- Oh, it just goes away?
- Yes.

49:53.032 --> 49:55.493
You took my thumbprint
off of SEAL biometrics.

49:55.576 --> 49:58.162
I was doing my job.
I was assisting on Odin's Sword.

50:02.125 --> 50:05.461
- You fucked up.
- Commander,

50:05.545 --> 50:06.963
I'm a federal agent.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.339
A federal agent.

50:08.423 --> 50:10.091
But I dialed 911.
That's the police.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.844
There's no fucking way
you would be first on the scene.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.887
No. Not unless
you were already there.

50:14.971 --> 50:16.097
Dispatch called us.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.349
They know you're Navy.
Of course they called us.

50:18.433 --> 50:19.892
They know you're Navy.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.689
Don't lie to me.

50:25.732 --> 50:26.733
I'm not.

50:29.193 --> 50:32.113
Fuck. Come on, goddamn it.

50:32.196 --> 50:34.240
I fucking knew it at Boozer's

50:34.323 --> 50:36.075
'cause I knew he didn't
fucking kill himself

50:36.159 --> 50:38.161
and I knew it in the tunnels
with Alpha Platoon

50:38.244 --> 50:39.787
and I fucking know it now. Okay?

50:39.871 --> 50:43.541
- Commander...
- You fucking set me up.

50:43.624 --> 50:44.751
You're unwell.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.796
You're unwell.

50:49.881 --> 50:51.174
You're unwell.

50:51.257 --> 50:54.469
If what you say is true,

50:54.552 --> 50:57.764
then there is no assassin.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.891
Then I killed my family.

51:01.100 --> 51:03.561
No. No.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.772
Fuck.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.277
You can convince me
of a lot of things,

51:11.360 --> 51:12.320
but you can't
convince me of that.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.697
Commander, no, don't.

51:14.781 --> 51:16.115
- Don't.
- Don't fucking move.
Lift your chin up.

51:16.199 --> 51:18.159
- No!
- Lift your fucking chin up.

51:18.242 --> 51:21.537
Saul Agnon. Saul Agnon.

51:21.621 --> 51:23.831
Saul Agnon. Saul Agnon.
Saul Agnon.

51:24.916 --> 51:26.918
What? What?

51:27.001 --> 51:28.503
- What are you saying?

51:28.586 --> 51:31.714
Saul Agnon, he... this guy,
he's the guy who pays me.

51:31.798 --> 51:33.341
- What?
- That's his name.

51:33.424 --> 51:36.886
He gives me information,
I-I get money in-in an account.

51:39.013 --> 51:41.098
That's all I know.
That's all I know.
