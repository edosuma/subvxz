00:18.101 --> 00:19.394
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:19.477 --> 00:21.312
Henry Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.355
[Love] We're a family.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.690
[Joe] Now that the baby's here,

00:23.773 --> 00:26.776
at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.319
Hey, Natalie. Hi.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.363
[Joe] My heart's not really in it.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.450
How could it be when you stole it?

00:34.993 --> 00:36.453
No. Husband, father. I can't.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.913
Sorry. I'm just looking for a friend.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.458
Everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.710
Even around Sherry and her mafia?

00:43.793 --> 00:46.337
[Natalie] It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

00:46.421 --> 00:51.051
-I have this fantasy of opening a bakery.
-There's a space available.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.011
Call me if you wanna see it.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.936
Natalie. I wanted to see
the place you were talking about.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.481
[Natalie]
You can have this place up crazy fast.

01:04.564 --> 01:09.360
This place could be a raging success.
So, what do you think? [gasps]

01:09.444 --> 01:11.154
Hey, Love. Hey, you okay?

01:11.237 --> 01:14.032
Joe, I think we need to go
to couples therapy.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.089
So, what brings you in?

01:31.466 --> 01:32.467
[door closes]

01:37.722 --> 01:39.599
-What?!
-Shh. Don't wake him up.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.853
Love, what did you do?

01:50.568 --> 01:52.278
What did you do?

01:52.362 --> 01:53.446
We had a fight.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.616
Obviously.
You wouldn't be here if you hadn't.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.868
Yeah. I caught him cheating.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.288
[Joe] Good, we're diving right in.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.543
[whispering] It's okay, Henry. I won't let
anything happen to you, I promise.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.590
[in normal voice]
Love, I told you, nothing happened.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.759
If anything, she came on to me.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.969
You kept a box.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.555
I know what that means.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.306
I know you.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.766
So you kill her?

02:21.850 --> 02:25.186
Technically, I didn't cheat.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.271
"Technically"?

02:26.354 --> 02:29.482
I caught him about to cheat.
It's the same thing.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.734
[Joe] The difference is
that I almost did a bad thing

02:31.818 --> 02:33.570
and she did a terrible thing.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.322
I can't say what she did,
so I'm the villain.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.116
I'm not saying I'm blameless.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.743
But she went crazy.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.788
What does that mean, "crazy"?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.498
[Joe] You're the shrink, that's your job.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.125
She flew off the handle...

02:48.042 --> 02:50.086
and broke a vase.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.172
A vase.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.549
-It was priceless.
-Cheap and tacky.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.009
Impossible to undo.

02:56.092 --> 03:00.263
Don't fight, don't make it worse.
There's no telling how she'll react.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.223
Okay.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.726
I broke a vase.

03:05.768 --> 03:10.982
It's just, sometimes, I get passionate.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.066
What are you doing?

03:12.775 --> 03:15.236
Her phone, Love.
Her trackable, traceable phone.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.741
Did you even think about that
before you buried an ax in our neighbor?

03:21.242 --> 03:24.037
No. No, I didn't plan it
like some psychopath.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.496
I-- Fuck.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.417
There's this too.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.169
I, um...

03:32.128 --> 03:37.926
-I signed the lease for the bakery.
-You signed a lease for our crime scene?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.302
Give me this.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.640
I thought it would be good,
a reason I was here with her.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.143
I know there's a mess to clean up,
but I couldn't leave

03:47.227 --> 03:49.437
and let somebody come in here.
And now we have--

03:49.520 --> 03:53.566
-You know, time to cover it up.
-We have no time. There's no time.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.569
I'm not good at this.
You backed me into a corner,

03:56.653 --> 04:00.114
-and I was trying to protect our family--
-[yelling] Let me focus!

04:00.198 --> 04:01.991
-[Henry crying]
-I got it!

04:08.039 --> 04:09.707
So you have a new baby?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.793
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Henry.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.213
-Sometimes we call him Forty.
-His name's Henry.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.966
A good therapist would dig
into why our child is named

04:18.049 --> 04:20.093
after her dead addict brother.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.513
So, Joe, how have you found
the transition to fatherhood?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.849
[Joe] A tangle of dread and failure.
Oh, and, also, murder.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.101
It's great.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.111
A little challenging.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.155
-For both of us.
-For me more than him.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.701
He's been-- and he'd admit--

04:45.827 --> 04:49.539
checked out, going through the motions.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.335
And it's like, "Why...?
Why isn't his heart in it?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.547
And why won't he try?"

04:58.214 --> 05:01.426
-I have been trying.
-You're saying you've been all in?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.430
When you're only truly present
maybe 50% of the time?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.724
[Joe] Textbook. She'd rather make it
about me and Henry

05:07.807 --> 05:09.726
than look at her part in this.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.437
Okay. Love, we need a story.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.230
A reason she died.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.693
She was unstable and unhappy,

05:18.776 --> 05:21.904
-and she killed herself.
-With an ax?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.282
She fell off a cliff
and hit her head. I don't know!

05:24.365 --> 05:26.075
She needs to disappear.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.994
Shh.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.792
Never to be found, never to be autopsied.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.421
Her phone, her iPad,
her car are impossible to hide.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.090
So we need to move her...

05:43.092 --> 05:46.971
things somewhere
and her body somewhere else.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.514
Okay. Uh--

05:49.223 --> 05:50.058
Where?

05:51.309 --> 05:53.603
There's a state forest

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
30 minutes from here.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.107
We bury her in the woods.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.902
That worked so well with Candace.

06:05.490 --> 06:10.912
I think, she's been holding
my past relationships against me.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.039
Well, you do have a pattern.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.707
[Joe] Don't bite, don't bite.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.958
And you don't?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.669
You wanna throw Candace
in my face right now?

06:18.753 --> 06:22.673
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's talk about how we handled that.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.302
What did you do with her body?
Or Delilah's, for that matter.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.306
-Because you have never shared.
-I told you, I took care of it.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.434
And I am asking you
how you took care of it.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.562
It's safer if you don't know, okay?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.650
Shit! Okay.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.820
You know, in L.A.,
there was this man named Jasper...

06:44.695 --> 06:48.282
who came after me
because of Will Bettelheim's debts.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.952
And he needed to disappear.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.497
-What did you do?
-I broke him down into smaller parts.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.791
-How? With, like, a saw?
-Yes.

06:56.874 --> 07:00.002
Also, it was...
You know, eventually, it had to be--

07:00.086 --> 07:03.256
In the end, a meat grinder was the way
to get him in a bag.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.215
At Anavrin?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.386
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.139
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:11.222 --> 07:13.641
-I used that thing all the time!
-What is your idea?

07:13.724 --> 07:15.768
Do you have a better one?
Of course you don't

07:15.852 --> 07:18.146
because you murdered our neighbor
in a fit of rage.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.731
No regard for the consequences.
This, today, Love, look.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.275
This? You did this.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.944
-You put our family in danger, Love.
-[Henry crying]

07:26.654 --> 07:29.157
-Where are you going?
-To take care of the baby.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.994
You can deal with Natalie. You cared more
about her than your own son anyway.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.459
-Shh! It's okay. It's okay.
-[Joe] I was wrong, Natalie.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.044
I thought you were a threat
to my marriage.

07:42.128 --> 07:46.924
But the real problem
with my marriage is my fucking wife.

07:54.557 --> 07:59.604
-So we don't know where to go from here.
-"You" don't know where to go from here.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.982
He may not know either,
but when you speak in "we,"

08:03.065 --> 08:07.069
you leave no room
for his individual experience or yours.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.907
The "we" is codependence
masquerading as love.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.908
I'm...

08:12.700 --> 08:13.868
-Sorry.
-[Chandra] Don't be.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.913
If you don't know
how to communicate healthily,

08:16.996 --> 08:18.915
it's because it was never modeled for you.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.959
[Joe] Oh, funny,
it's already "blame-the-parents o'clock."

08:22.043 --> 08:23.461
I'll be honest with you.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.882
I don't think this fight has anything
to do with Joe's so-called cheating.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.008
[Joe] She doesn't?

08:29.091 --> 08:30.927
-You don't?
-Mm-mm. Not really.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.639
Do you know what it is about?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.266
Not yet. But keep talking.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.773
So why don't you tell me
what you went through, alone,

08:43.856 --> 08:45.399
in the aftermath of the argument.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.320
-Well, I--
-Actually...

08:49.987 --> 08:52.156
I'd like to hear from Joe first.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.366
[Joe] She would?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.744
Maybe she can sense the inequity here.

08:58.287 --> 09:02.875
Yeah, well, like I said, nothing was ever
going to happen with this woman.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.836
But, after the fight,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.547
I felt obligated...

09:09.173 --> 09:11.801
to get rid of her for good.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.094
"Obligated"?

09:13.886 --> 09:14.762
Forced.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.222
By your wife?

09:17.014 --> 09:17.848
Yes.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.435
How did that make you feel?

09:22.812 --> 09:25.523
[Joe] Fuck Love. Fuck her. Fuck this.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.024
Fuck whoever made these bags.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.278
Where is that little perforated line?
Which end is it?

09:34.574 --> 09:38.160
I should let Love take the fall for this.
But, no, she knows what I've done.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.037
She knows me. Fuck marriage!

09:47.503 --> 09:49.046
All right, Natalie.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.466
This is the story of your disappearance.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.218
You show my wife the bakery.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.761
She signs a lease.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.140
An hour later, you text your husband.

09:59.682 --> 10:03.686
No emoji, no emotion,
like the rest of your texts with Matthew.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.104
It's terse, all business.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.940
The rental in question is
a cute cabin you manage,

10:08.024 --> 10:10.901
30 minutes out on the border
of the state forest.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.571
Your car, phone, iPad,

10:13.654 --> 10:16.824
and all their invasive
location-tracking technologies will take

10:16.907 --> 10:19.076
a scenic drive to the property.

10:21.495 --> 10:25.916
Your body is headed somewhere else
but more on that in a moment.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.377
Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck my life.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.339
No, no, stop. Reel it in. Think of Henry.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.341
I cannot get this wrong.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.509
The point is, Natalie,

10:35.593 --> 10:39.138
although your stuff will make it
to the cabin, you simply disappear.

10:39.221 --> 10:43.476
Your last text will be to your sister,
suggesting you are deeply unhappy,

10:43.559 --> 10:46.103
leaving plenty of room for interpretation.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.315
Rumor: Did you leave
your cold and distant husband?

10:49.398 --> 10:53.361
Were you abducted? Assume a new identity?
Who can ever say for sure?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.574
And in the event
there are traffic cameras in town...

11:01.077 --> 11:05.665
So you put an end to the other woman
and you feel...

11:07.041 --> 11:08.292
Emasculated.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.300
[Joe] Here's the problem
my wife left us to clean up.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.969
Natalie, your trackables
and your body need to part ways

11:19.053 --> 11:21.972
somewhere a person would
reasonably pull over if they were alive.

11:22.056 --> 11:26.143
And then, well... Then I need to find
some magically perfect place

11:26.227 --> 11:27.853
to leave you forever.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.235
Burying you in the woods is
the best I've got.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.196
If she wanted it her way,
she should have done the hard part.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.742
This isn't me though.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.161
I put this behind me.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.664
I changed-- You know what's funny?

11:46.747 --> 11:48.249
For Love. For her.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.169
Because I wanted to be good enough
for her. And look at me now.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.592
I'm worried about Henry.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.304
I don't recognize Love anymore.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.269
I don't even recognize myself.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.777
Maybe you were on to something, Natalie.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
Kids aren't handcuffs.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.706
When I'm done cleaning up Love's mess,
I am packing my bags,

12:28.789 --> 12:32.251
taking Henry and getting the fuck out.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.588
You were going to leave me?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.591
-Are you insane?
-Uh-uh.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.508
No.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.594
You must listen.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.388
I am listening, every word. How--?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.141
There's a difference
between a reaction and a response.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.561
The latter is thoughtful,
the former, impulsive.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.189
Why does everybody think I'm impulsive?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.399
Who is "everybody"?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.151
[Joe] You know, she's good.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.737
Uh--

12:59.820 --> 13:01.822
[Chandra]
Does someone else make you feel like this?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.287
[Dottie] Good morning. Hello?

13:08.370 --> 13:09.205
Hey, Mom.

13:12.041 --> 13:12.917
Hey.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.087
Sleepy Forty.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.131
Aren't you a little gift?

13:19.215 --> 13:21.425
Why didn't you answer my calls?

13:21.509 --> 13:22.885
Oh, I've been busy.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.514
I signed a new lease
on a cute little bakery in town.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.932
-A bakery?
-Yeah.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.267
I need to head to the market.
Can you watch him?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.729
He should be down for a nap.
I need to start stocking the shop.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.231
Hold on. A bakery?

13:35.314 --> 13:39.235
-In a town that's peak keto?
-Yeah, yeah. I will convert them.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.488
I told you
that Quinn family finances were in flux.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.156
We'll figure it out.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.367
As in,

13:47.076 --> 13:51.831
I can't guarantee
I can help you with a lease, financially.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.085
Mom, that is very different
than vaguely mentioning "flux."

13:56.669 --> 13:59.004
It's a three-year lease
with a huge deposit.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.007
I would have told you
if you'd taken the time to ask.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.510
Is this another one of your episodes?

14:05.803 --> 14:06.846
"Episodes"?

14:06.929 --> 14:10.516
You know, it all feels a tad impulsive.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.519
So, what is it about these...

14:14.645 --> 14:17.606
labels that are so hurtful?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.028
Well, it's like...

14:24.154 --> 14:25.447
nobody gets me.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.450
Why I do things, how I do them.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.205
It's like, I just wanna be
a good role model for my child.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.583
And that means doing more.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.502
Stay with the feeling. "Nobody gets you."

14:40.254 --> 14:46.051
[Joe] Shit. It's hard to stay angry
when she's so-- But what's not to get?

14:46.135 --> 14:49.013
She's relatable except for the part
where she's an ax murderer.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.224
Is that gettable? Is it my fault
if I don't want to get that?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.267
Um...

14:54.143 --> 14:55.019
[chuckles]

14:55.561 --> 14:57.938
I just remembered this moment at the...

14:59.773 --> 15:01.275
at the store.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.071
-Fuck.
-I got you.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.199
-There you go. You need a...?
-Thank you.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.577
-Need a hand with any of this?
-No, I'm good.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.494
All right.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.292
Shameless.

15:19.543 --> 15:20.669
Yeah.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.924
I'm a fem-gen major
if that's any comfort at all.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.719
It's Feminist Gender
and Sexuality Studies.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.846
So I aim to be fluent.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.014
-Nice.
-Yeah.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.101
I'm Theo, by the way. What's your name?

15:38.687 --> 15:41.982
I'm married.
And half these groceries are for my baby.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.736
Yeah, yeah, if there's one thing
I know about babies,

15:45.819 --> 15:47.196
they really love yeast.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.239
They just guzzle the stuff.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.534
-That's for the bakery I'm opening.
-Oh, shit. Where is it?

15:54.036 --> 15:57.498
-Um, off Main Street, near Town Square.
-Okay.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.084
-Oh, where Sweet Dreams used to be.
-Yeah.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.127
Before that, it was Curry Home for Dinner.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.380
So the pun name is a requisite.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.547
-Okay.
-Yeah.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.967
-You're from here?
-I am, I am.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.344
And you are new in town.

16:10.427 --> 16:14.139
They haven't converted you
to full-time athleisure yet.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.224
Congratulations.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.392
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

16:16.475 --> 16:18.936
Yeah, L.A. runs strong in these veins.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.771
Damn, girl.

16:21.563 --> 16:25.150
So you got a new town, new baby,

16:25.234 --> 16:27.987
new bakery, banging body.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.571
[chuckles]

16:29.989 --> 16:31.657
You're just doing it all.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.868
It's a tax.

16:39.331 --> 16:43.794
[Chandra] What were you feeling when
this stranger paid you so much attention?

16:47.006 --> 16:47.965
Guilty.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.050
'Cause it felt so good.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.762
And then really sad

16:54.388 --> 16:57.433
'cause I didn't want that from a stranger.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.309
I wanted that from my husband.

16:59.393 --> 17:03.439
[Joe] And just like that,
she's the victim again. Masterful.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.399
How does that sit with you?

17:08.402 --> 17:09.278
I'm flattered.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.447
[Chandra] Mm.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
Your face tells a different story.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.452
If anything, you seem repulsed.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.203
[Joe] Dumb, back-stabbing face.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.872
No. What--? No.

17:19.955 --> 17:24.960
No, no, no. Look, I haven't been
as present as I would like...

17:26.378 --> 17:27.421
lately.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.214
Parenthood is an adjustment.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.134
But I'm...

17:32.926 --> 17:36.013
-I'm here, right?
-[Chandra] True.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.515
Maybe being here is already
a radical concession,

17:38.599 --> 17:40.893
given you were on the verge
of leaving for good.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.521
So why didn't you?

17:45.439 --> 17:46.315
Leave her?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.526
[ominous music playing]

17:50.194 --> 17:54.490
[Joe] Maybe I'll take Henry some place
like this lovely rental cabin of yours.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.033
Pretty, quiet.

17:56.700 --> 18:02.081
You could have helped me vanish, Natalie.
But now... it's time to vanish you.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.666
Your husband won't suspect
you're missing for a day.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.002
All that remains is
a cryptic text to your sister,

18:07.086 --> 18:12.341
then I gotta hike ten miserable miles,
catch a ride home and start packing.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.343
Oh, what's this?

18:15.969 --> 18:18.680
"Tell me I shouldn't fuck
the boring neighbor"?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.642
"Boring neighbor"?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.313
Is that all I was to you?

18:27.397 --> 18:28.982
Is that all you were?

18:30.234 --> 18:34.196
A restless housewife? A stereotype?
Maybe Love was right about you.

18:34.279 --> 18:39.785
No, no, no. She had no right to kill you.
Still, things could've gotten messy fast.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.789
Maybe I would've made a mess.
Maybe Love was right. No, she wasn't.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.625
-Shit.
-[Chandra] It's not a trick question.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.294
Why didn't you run?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.050
Well, because...

18:58.220 --> 19:03.142
I couldn't convince myself
that Henry would be better off.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.478
He needs both of us.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.859
So you stayed for the child,
not for your wife.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.822
[alarm beeps]

19:17.239 --> 19:19.741
Unfortunately, that's our time for today.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.243
I'm giving you homework.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.539
"How to talk."

19:26.039 --> 19:30.794
The reflective listening exercise will
help structure difficult conversations.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.714
Slow down, respond...

19:34.506 --> 19:36.675
-instead of react.
-[Joe] That's Love's homework.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.428
Mine is to prevent her
from murdering this therapist.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.222
[Chandra] And I'd like to see you
as soon as possible,

19:42.306 --> 19:46.185
given we are in a bit
of a triage situation.

19:46.768 --> 19:47.686
Is it that bad?

19:47.769 --> 19:50.647
You want me to tell you
whether or not you should be together.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.487
The truth is, the easiest thing is
to end this marriage.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.824
Either one of you have
the power to do it tonight.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.828
You must choose to stay together
every minute from now until death,

20:04.912 --> 20:06.538
and that takes a lot of will

20:06.622 --> 20:09.041
and something both of you are willing
to fight for.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.086
So far, I've only heard you fight
to be right.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.964
You need a deeper purpose.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.926
[Joe] Henry. If nothing else, Love and I--

20:19.009 --> 20:20.802
And don't say "Henry."

20:20.886 --> 20:23.639
If children were enough reason
to stay married,

20:23.722 --> 20:26.016
we'd have no divorced parents.

20:26.099 --> 20:26.975
[Joe] Shit.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.818
What's the only thing worse
than couples therapy?

20:37.361 --> 20:38.695
Coming home afterward.

20:40.447 --> 20:44.409
Dr. Chandra's "How to talk" worksheet is
mostly about how to listen,

20:44.493 --> 20:46.995
which may be useful if we ever talk again.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.832
Okay, so Sherry's wedding cake
was lemon-raspberry.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.462
So I think that gluten-free, sugar-free,

20:55.545 --> 20:59.716
fucking happiness-free cupcakes,
that should be a safe bet.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.303
Andrew and Jackson's kid's party.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.473
We're still going to that?
Don't you think that...?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.767
Wait. Do you have some packing
and running to do?

21:11.061 --> 21:15.983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me try it again. I'm sorry.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.195
[Love clearing throat]

21:22.906 --> 21:26.576
What I'm hearing is that you think

21:26.660 --> 21:29.997
that Natalie and us should be
the only people

21:30.080 --> 21:34.001
who mysteriously
don't attend today's party.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.711
[Joe] Not better.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.297
-That's not what I'm saying.
-No?

21:38.380 --> 21:42.134
What I'm hearing is that you would
really like some alone time.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.387
So I'm gonna go take Henry
and let you work in peace.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.058
Not what I said.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.977
[upbeat electronic music playing]

22:05.365 --> 22:06.950
You two again.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.493
[Joe] Yes, us again.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.329
There you go.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.165
That was a quick read.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.876
Need me to find another beautiful woman
to recommend the next one?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.544
I already found one.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.256
I was hoping you could show me
the rare books section.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.175
What makes you think we have one?

22:23.258 --> 22:25.427
[Joe] A dumbwaiter indicates a basement

22:25.510 --> 22:28.305
where a mole-rat person looks after
the valuable books.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.639
But I'm guessing...

22:29.723 --> 22:31.683
We don't have anyone down there right now.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.809
Okay, yeah.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.437
Well, maybe you could escort us.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.105
We'll be very quick.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.316
I promise.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.117
And here we are.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.996
[Joe] Yikes. These poor books.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.540
You looking for anything specific?

22:56.666 --> 22:59.753
You know what,
I think I'll know it when I see it.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.046
Mind if I take a look?

23:01.129 --> 23:02.381
-Please.
-Okay.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.848
I thought you said
no one worked down here.

23:11.932 --> 23:15.394
Oh, I do, sometimes.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.396
When it's slow upstairs.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.356
[Joe] Interesting. Keep her talking.

23:19.439 --> 23:22.109
So... you're an artist.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.861
I'm a librarian who draws.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.571
[Joe] Looks like more than that to me.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.033
Anything other
than Victorian science books down here?

23:30.117 --> 23:31.368
Okay, nosy.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.037
I illustrate books sometimes.

23:34.121 --> 23:37.332
-It's just a side hustle though.
-Bingo.

23:40.252 --> 23:44.673
So is there anywhere that I can see
your work, like online maybe or...?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.299
-Why?
-[Henry crying]

23:46.842 --> 23:50.470
-You write a kids' book?
-No, I'm just a connoisseur.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.388
Here we go.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.476
Wildflowers of New York.

23:57.644 --> 24:02.065
Do you need a 100-year-old gardening book
instead of a new one upstairs?

24:02.149 --> 24:04.943
Nothing beats the classics.
I can have this back in a few days.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.279
No. You're not supposed
to take these ones home.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.072
Okay. I can read it upstairs.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.992
I think he should calm down
in just a bit. Right, Henry?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.702
That's okay. Just take it.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.830
-Thank you, thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.665
[Joe] Glad someone's got my back.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.753
Less than ideal to steal, of course.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.507
But Ellie needs cash,
and I can't touch Quinn funds

24:27.591 --> 24:30.343
for fear of them finding out where she is.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.304
[pop music playing]

24:32.387 --> 24:36.057
And let's be honest,
it feels good to fix something.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.145
Especially when everything else feels
so unfixable.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.231
Oh, shit. I knew it, we're late.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.400
[Joe] What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.903
-Is this really the life I want?
-Hi.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.280
-Welcome.
-The only thing worse than a kid's party

24:50.363 --> 24:51.448
is a rich kid's party.

25:02.417 --> 25:03.793
[woman] A little bit to the right.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.004
One more.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.631
Oh, you're early.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.508
Hi. Yeah, I--

25:09.591 --> 25:12.052
-We thought that...
-Oh, it's fine. Fine.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.137
Most of the gang's here to help set up.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.181
Um...

25:16.765 --> 25:20.060
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna put these somewhere.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.647
Hey, boys! Look who's here.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.776
-Hey!
-Yo, Joe! Let's get you drunk!

25:27.859 --> 25:30.028
Stop. But seriously...

25:31.321 --> 25:34.407
-how drunk do you wanna be for this?
-Love!

25:34.491 --> 25:36.618
-We didn't think we'd see you today.
-Oh.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.288
-You left in such a hurry the other night.
-Oh, yeah, I'm sorry for ghosting.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.500
My mom was watching the baby,
and Dottie has an expiration time.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.502
Alcohol? Pills?

25:46.545 --> 25:50.257
It's no judgment. I could only imagine
what she's been through. Oh!

25:51.216 --> 25:54.678
I could cry right now.
Being a mom of twins...

25:54.761 --> 25:58.723
Losing one would be like... losing both.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.768
I made cupcakes.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.520
-You made those?
-Gorgeous.

26:03.603 --> 26:08.358
Yes. I am also opening a bakery.
A cute little spot on Main Street.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.443
I love that.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.320
So brave.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.323
You've heard
that spot hasn't had much success,

26:15.407 --> 26:17.242
-but it's never had you, mama.
-Yeah.

26:17.325 --> 26:20.287
I was hoping you lovelies would be
my guinea pigs.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.377
Don't worry, they're organic
and, like, everything-free.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.879
They're lemon-raspberry.

26:29.963 --> 26:34.926
You know, I'm not really a fan
of lemon or raspberry.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.431
-Already hit my macro.
-I'm fasting.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.599
Oh!

26:40.682 --> 26:42.892
We should get our kids in their costumes.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.063
[Cary] Screw your liver.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.150
Seventy percent of G-clearance happens
in the peripheral tissue.

26:50.233 --> 26:54.321
[Joe] This is what fun looks like
in Madre Linda: glorified productivity.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.365
I want the best for my son.
No denying, this beats a group home,

26:57.449 --> 27:00.201
but there's gotta be
a third bowl of porridge.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.828
Bottom line, 45-minute orgasm.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.456
-No way.
-Sick. I'll invest.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.583
[Joe] Things I've learned
in the past ten minutes:

27:06.666 --> 27:11.379
ejaculating too much can deplete focus,
so Cary patented "injaculating."

27:11.463 --> 27:14.633
Sherry started nicknaming me
"The Stallion."

27:14.716 --> 27:17.677
[Joe] And Gil is only
a hair less outsider than me.

27:17.761 --> 27:22.015
Judging by the gasps he gives
every time Cary says the word "ejaculate,"

27:22.098 --> 27:24.309
I'd guess that Gil waited till marriage.

27:24.392 --> 27:27.062
-Daddy! Daddy!
-[Joe] Thank you, tiny intruder.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.230
Hey. Having fun?
I want you to meet someone.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.067
This is Joe. Joe, this is Zoe. Zoe, Joe.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.362
I've seen you at the library.
I read to the kids there.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.155
You and Henry should join. It's fun.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.531
-We can carpool.
-Maybe.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.868
Rather lose another finger than carpool
with Mormon Neville Longbottom.

27:41.951 --> 27:45.038
So far, nothing about this place
worth fighting for.

27:45.121 --> 27:48.166
-[Sherry] Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh. Sherry's siren song.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.251
Duty calls, men.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.129
[Sherry] Don't eat sugar! Honey, no!

27:53.213 --> 27:55.006
Go ahead. I can watch the little guy.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.841
Yeah? Okay. Thank you.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.010
-Sure, no problem.
-[Joe] Nice guy.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.721
Maybe I'm still looking
for reasons to run.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.766
Get that-- No, baby. Oh, baby girl, no!

28:05.475 --> 28:08.561
You have completely spiked
their blood sugar, Love.

28:08.645 --> 28:12.065
-No, they're sugar-free.
-There's sugar in raspberries.

28:12.148 --> 28:15.068
-We don't let them eat fruit. Come on.
-Oh.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.821
Let's go, babies. This way.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.782
Cary, I am so sorry.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.867
That's fine. They're kids.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.831
Hey, I'll give the wife
a little you-know-what later,

28:27.914 --> 28:30.792
and she'll just lose all memory of this.

28:30.875 --> 28:35.338
Don't worry. I got the twins wearing
those Vital Rings of Matthew's.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.423
[Joe] Matthew...

28:38.758 --> 28:39.592
See?

28:39.676 --> 28:42.220
Heart rates and blood sugar,
totally normal.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.598
Does this have GPS?

28:45.682 --> 28:48.351
Oh, yeah. Leave it to Matthew.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.771
He could give a shit about your health,
he's just horny for the data.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.983
It's pretty spotty,
but it gives you the general idea.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.069
-We all wear them.
-[Joe] No.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.696
No, no.

28:59.779 --> 29:03.950
If Matthew has access to Natalie's ring,
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.036
Do you think they could see
that her heart stopped?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.122
-I didn't invent the fucking ring.
-[Matthew] Stop!

29:11.082 --> 29:12.333
Hey. Hey, man.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.754
No, listen to me.
We need to stop production, then.

29:15.837 --> 29:18.465
[Joe] He hasn't put it together yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

29:18.548 --> 29:22.886
Natalie's been gone over 24 hours.
Our window is rapidly closing.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.347
[dramatic music playing]

29:33.313 --> 29:36.691
-What? Are you bringing him?
-Wanna leave him in the car?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.485
That's Bad Parenting 101.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.032
Witnessing us dig up a body isn't?

29:44.657 --> 29:48.077
He has barely any depth perception,
which you should know.

29:48.912 --> 29:54.709
What I'm hearing is, even as I am doing
everything in my power to save my child,

29:54.793 --> 29:57.003
my parenting skills aren't up
to your standards.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.838
Is this important right now?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.145
Oh, fuck!

30:18.274 --> 30:19.651
Why does she look like that?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.487
I had to remove her teeth.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.659
Right. Dental records. Yeah.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.412
Where did you put them?

30:32.497 --> 30:35.542
The teeth? Don't wanna find them
in a hidey-hole in my house.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.586
You won't. It's safer if you don't know.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.841
[grunting]

30:48.555 --> 30:51.516
-What?
-Might want to wait in the car with Henry.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.726
I can handle it. Just fucking do it.

30:54.769 --> 30:55.603
[Joe] We'll see.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.939
[bones cracking]

31:09.826 --> 31:12.078
It's cracked. Maybe that's good.

31:12.161 --> 31:15.415
Could've just broken when--
In the bakery when she fell.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.541
But what if it didn't?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.670
Still have to move it.
The body can't be where the ring died.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.130
-So just...
-Yeah.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.761
[thunder crashing]

31:37.896 --> 31:39.314
[breathing heavily]

31:40.732 --> 31:41.774
[Henry coos]

31:45.403 --> 31:48.615
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

31:51.743 --> 31:52.577
What now?

31:54.370 --> 31:55.496
I know where to go.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.843
You said we needed a permanent solution.
We're on the edge of town.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.887
They're pouring a foundation tomorrow.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.557
Under a slab of cement is permanent.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.226
-How did you know we'd rebury her?
-I didn't.

32:17.852 --> 32:21.481
I drove past it yesterday,
so I looked into it. A backup plan.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.526
How many of those do you have?

32:26.277 --> 32:29.489
Do you just drive around
making mental notes

32:29.572 --> 32:32.784
of good places to disappear people?

32:32.867 --> 32:35.703
Considering who I'm married to, yeah.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.081
I kind of have to.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.666
Oh, I'm the psycho.

32:39.749 --> 32:43.086
How did you get rid of her so fast?
How did you know where to go?

32:43.169 --> 32:46.839
-What were you planning for?
-What are you insinuating?

32:56.057 --> 32:59.727
Why is she doing this now?
We have a body to take care of.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.563
If this is a partnership,
I'm better off alone.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.984
-Love?
-[yelling] Why don't you love me anymore?!

33:06.067 --> 33:09.612
-You know why, you just won't say it.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.824
You had a hook to my throat.
And then I said I was pregnant.

33:13.574 --> 33:16.494
And then we just went on
and pretended like it didn't happen.

33:16.577 --> 33:20.456
No, no, no, we didn't!
It was a bad moment. For both of us.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.918
-It was a bad moment a lifetime ago.
-Fuck you. Fuck you.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.587
You act all pure and noble,

33:26.671 --> 33:29.757
like you have reasons
for what you do when you do it.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.968
But when I do it, I'm crazy, right?

33:32.051 --> 33:34.012
I'm some manic nutjob.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.388
"But, oh, wait! Oh, wait!

33:35.471 --> 33:38.433
She's a mom now,
I guess I can't slit her throat."

33:40.435 --> 33:44.981
He... is the only reason I'm alive.

33:46.482 --> 33:49.485
How do you think that makes me feel?
I can't trust you.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.780
I can't trust you either!

33:52.864 --> 33:54.323
I was trying to--

33:54.407 --> 33:57.535
Yes, yes. Yes, I did things.

33:58.286 --> 34:02.707
But I've worked hard to be better
and I am not that person anymore.

34:02.790 --> 34:03.624
But now,

34:04.375 --> 34:07.795
I will be burying bodies
until I'm 70 years old!

34:08.671 --> 34:12.008
Because if I'm not 100% into you
all of the time,

34:12.091 --> 34:15.386
you will keep killing people!

34:15.470 --> 34:19.390
If I'm not enough for you, you'll kill me.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.267
You said that out loud?

34:23.019 --> 34:25.438
I want you to listen closely.

34:25.521 --> 34:29.942
Fifty percent of my married clients want
to kill each other.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.069
It's normal.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.112
And here's the better news,

34:33.196 --> 34:35.198
neither one of you is gonna kill
your spouse.

34:35.281 --> 34:38.326
You're many things,
but you are not murderers.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.165
The intensity here is a very good sign.

34:44.248 --> 34:48.044
You're not fighting to be right,
you're fighting for your lives.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.338
Deeper. Right?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.466
-[Joe] Scarier.
-Joe.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.887
Can you think of any times
when you felt as violent as you did

34:57.970 --> 34:59.639
toward Love in your fight?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.018
A few.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.062
No, I'm pregnant!

35:07.688 --> 35:09.232
I'm not a violent person.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.986
What if sometimes you are?
What if that's normal?

35:18.699 --> 35:20.284
Stop. Stop!

35:21.828 --> 35:24.622
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.165
[Chandra] I believe you.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.544
So, what's the feeling under the rage?

35:33.214 --> 35:34.465
Fear.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.425
Fear that...?

35:39.637 --> 35:42.765
Joe, stay with the violent thoughts.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.519
You're broken. I could never love you.

35:46.602 --> 35:47.854
You're crazy!

35:47.937 --> 35:50.815
What did you do? What did you do?

35:52.233 --> 35:53.401
If someone...

35:55.278 --> 35:56.195
sees me...

35:56.279 --> 35:58.990
-Why does she look like that?
-I had to remove her teeth.

35:59.782 --> 36:01.576
If someone sees the real me...

36:05.663 --> 36:06.664
they'll go away.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.541
For good.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.053
What about you, Love?

36:23.389 --> 36:26.642
When else have you felt the way
that Joe makes you feel?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.194
When I feel...

36:38.404 --> 36:40.907
-protective.
-What are you fighting to protect?

36:41.532 --> 36:44.160
-My family.
-Why specifically family?

36:44.744 --> 36:45.828
That's what you do.

36:47.955 --> 36:50.208
What do you get from your family?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.584
I don't know.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.840
A family is supposed to...

36:59.258 --> 37:00.760
love you unconditionally.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.720
Why is that so important?

37:02.803 --> 37:05.973
Why does love have to be unconditional?

37:10.144 --> 37:11.354
Because if anyone...

37:14.523 --> 37:15.399
saw...

37:18.694 --> 37:22.823
how ugly I can be...

37:25.993 --> 37:28.329
They'll go away for good.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.957
[pensive music playing]

37:43.386 --> 37:45.930
Fair to say one of the things
you have in common

37:46.013 --> 37:52.311
is fear of abandonment so deep,
it feels downright kill-or-be-killed.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.355
Metaphorically speaking.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.774
When our patterns line up like this,

37:56.857 --> 38:00.111
it's very, very hard
to see the other person

38:00.194 --> 38:03.322
because it's dangerously close
to looking in a mirror.

38:03.406 --> 38:08.119
[Joe] We're talking about
the worst things, so why do I feel relief?

38:08.202 --> 38:10.204
So how are we, um--

38:10.288 --> 38:12.331
I'm sorry. Joe and I.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.459
--supposed to make this work?

38:17.378 --> 38:19.005
That's the perfect word.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.424
"Work." Because that's what it takes.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.468
Let go of unconditional.
There's no such thing.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.305
There's agreeing
to show up the best we can.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.849
In the best marriages,

38:29.932 --> 38:32.810
each partner challenges the other
every day

38:32.893 --> 38:34.979
to be a better version of themselves.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.315
-Sounds like a lot of fighting.
-Sure.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.567
But is all fighting bad?

38:40.526 --> 38:43.362
Maybe this isn't two opponents in a ring.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.782
Maybe this is two on the same team

38:46.866 --> 38:49.243
fighting for the same thing.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.205
That sounds good.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.711
Having someone on my... team.

39:00.963 --> 39:01.797
Yeah.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.175
Yeah, that sounds nice.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.764
[Chandra] There you go.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.811
