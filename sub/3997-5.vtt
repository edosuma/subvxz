00:07.025 --> 00:08.571
- Hello.
- I made you a cake.

00:08.574 --> 00:11.003
Can't. Booked a car
show for tomorrow,

00:11.004 --> 00:13.528
and I have been so good this week.

00:13.529 --> 00:16.008
- I lost four pounds.
- Come on, Cece.

00:16.011 --> 00:18.016
It's your birthday.
We're gonna eat cake,

00:18.017 --> 00:19.767
we're gonna watch Clueless on VHS,

00:19.768 --> 00:22.008
and we're gonna try to make
prom dresses out of towels.

00:22.009 --> 00:24.066
Obviously, just like we always do.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.095
As if!

00:25.596 --> 00:29.070
As if is, like, the funniest thing ever.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.046
I wish I had a stepbrother
to fall in love with.

00:31.047 --> 00:34.003
I know, right? Paul Rudd.

00:34.004 --> 00:36.003
You know, actually,
I thought maybe this year,

00:36.004 --> 00:37.999
we could go out, you know?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.120
We go party tonight.

00:39.121 --> 00:43.041
Let dogs out.
Catch gypsy.

00:43.042 --> 00:46.769
Yeah. Yeah, Nadia wants me to go
to this last-minute thing

00:46.770 --> 00:48.090
she found out about, so I thought

00:48.091 --> 00:50.079
we could all, you know,
just go out tonight.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.000
- You, me, Nadia, the girls.
- The models?

00:53.003 --> 00:55.057
Yes, Jess, the models.
Please?

00:55.058 --> 00:58.066
You and I have never spent
my birthday apart, ever.

00:58.067 --> 01:00.015
Except for the one time in seventh grade

01:00.016 --> 01:01.954
where you walked out
of my sleepover because

01:01.955 --> 01:04.075
- you claimed...
- When you struck me in the breast.

01:04.075 --> 01:05.996
But I didn't even touch boob,
because you know,

01:05.997 --> 01:07.957
- we all knew you were stuffing...
- My God.

01:07.958 --> 01:09.878
We were all stuffing.
Stuffing? We all stuffed.

01:09.879 --> 01:11.799
You've seen my grandmother.
I was not stuffing.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.320
Yes, we were.

01:12.321 --> 01:15.012
- It was seventh grade.
- I've been like this since I was seven.

01:15.015 --> 01:17.029
- You're...
- Come out with us tonight!

01:17.032 --> 01:19.054
- Please, please, please!
- Okay.

01:19.057 --> 01:20.083
- Okay.
- I'll come.

01:20.086 --> 01:22.007
Thank you.

01:23.004 --> 01:24.045
I so excited.

01:24.046 --> 01:28.003

Hey, do you think

01:46.050 --> 01:48.599
Jess would be mad if I got
a turtle and named it Jess,

01:48.600 --> 01:51.000
even though I had that name
picked out before she moved in?

01:51.001 --> 01:53.081
- A turtle?
- Thinking man's best friend, Schmidty.

01:53.082 --> 01:56.091
In our home? Over my
turtle-disease-ridden dead body.

01:56.092 --> 01:58.071
Whatever, dream killer.
What's this?

01:59.072 --> 02:00.003
Got you a cookie.

02:00.004 --> 02:02.095
What, you have, like...?

02:02.096 --> 02:03.096
Have, like, an extra?

02:04.597 --> 02:06.032
No.

02:07.033 --> 02:08.595
So you just, like, got me a cookie?

02:08.596 --> 02:11.027
Yeah, I was thinking about you.

02:11.529 --> 02:13.532
What do you mean you
were thinking about me?

02:13.533 --> 02:15.853
What do you mean? I don't know.
I was thinking about you.

02:15.854 --> 02:17.571
Think about you a lot, bro.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.507
Why?

02:21.508 --> 02:23.868
I don't know. Because you're
my friend, you're on my mind.

02:24.089 --> 02:26.537
What, do you not think about me?

02:26.538 --> 02:28.595
Of course not!

02:31.575 --> 02:33.549
Schmidt got me a cookie.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.595
Very nice.

02:37.096 --> 02:38.541
What do you guys think?

02:38.542 --> 02:40.512
Smokin' hot.

02:40.513 --> 02:42.713
I'm going out tonight with Cece
and her model friends,

02:42.714 --> 02:46.520
and I'm going for "promising
ballerina turned streetwalker."

02:46.521 --> 02:48.541
You have too much joie de vivre.

02:48.542 --> 02:51.545
Okay, you want to look
a little bit more bored, tired.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.561
Just altogether disengaged.

02:53.562 --> 02:55.042
More tired... more,
like, sick-like.

02:55.043 --> 02:57.503
Really let your bones prop you up.

02:57.504 --> 02:58.984
Did you put shoe polish on your eyes?

02:58.985 --> 03:01.520
I never understand
you women... God.

03:01.521 --> 03:03.508
- Eye shadow, man.
- That's...?

03:03.509 --> 03:04.527
That's makeup?

03:04.528 --> 03:05.552
I would take that off.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.560
That looks crazy.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.681
Can't believe I have to deal

03:07.682 --> 03:09.540
with the models just
to hang out with Cece.

03:09.541 --> 03:10.981
Last time we hung out, it was awful.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.372
I figure the best way to talk

03:12.373 --> 03:14.533
to models is just point
to objects and describe them.

03:14.534 --> 03:16.595
The table is round.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.553
It's also flat.

03:18.554 --> 03:22.524
Yes, the table is round, and it's flat.

03:22.525 --> 03:23.567
Look, a lamp.

03:25.508 --> 03:27.504
I love Cece, and these are Cece's friends,

03:27.505 --> 03:29.553
so I should be able
to get along with them.

03:29.554 --> 03:31.566
I should be able to deal with the fact

03:31.567 --> 03:34.595
that they think I look like a monkey...

03:34.596 --> 03:37.570
from a Russian cracker ad.

03:45.596 --> 03:47.553
Whatever.

03:47.554 --> 03:49.595
It's Cece's birthday.
It's her special night.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.588
I can get drunk, point at furniture

03:51.589 --> 03:54.503
if that means I can spend
some quality time with my BFF.

- You made it!
- Sorry I'm late.

04:06.539 --> 04:08.779

Monkey cracker.

Monkey cracker.

04:14.509 --> 04:15.511
Monkey,

04:15.512 --> 04:18.499
monkey, where you keep the crackers?

04:18.500 --> 04:19.575
This is so much fun.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.542
Schmidt?

04:23.543 --> 04:25.516
So, it turns out

04:25.517 --> 04:27.520
there's more than one type of turtle.

04:27.521 --> 04:29.595
I could go Eastern Box, or spur thighed,

04:29.596 --> 04:31.553
or nearsighted loner.

04:32.597 --> 04:34.588
What was that?
You just grunt at me?

04:34.589 --> 04:36.571
- Wasn't a grunt.
- That was a grunt, Schmidt.

04:36.574 --> 04:39.554
- It was a "hurumph."
- A "hurumph" sounds like this: Hurumph.

04:39.555 --> 04:41.955
I'm sorry if you took it the
wrong way; it was not a grunt.

04:41.956 --> 04:43.356
Serena Williams.
That was a grunt.

04:43.357 --> 04:44.557
It's all good, man, all right?

04:44.558 --> 04:46.511
It's all "smoove in the groove."

04:46.512 --> 04:48.503
Mellow, man.

You don't think about me?

05:06.576 --> 05:09.576
- What are you talking about?
- Earlier today, when I gave you the cookie,

05:09.577 --> 05:11.897
I heard very clearly, "I don't
think about you, Schmidt."

05:11.898 --> 05:14.938
- Why would I think about you?!
- Because we're friends, we're not animals.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.507
We're men, Schmidt! The only
time a man is allowed to think

05:18.508 --> 05:20.588
about another man is
when that man is Jay Cutler.

05:20.589 --> 05:22.561
I don't know who Jay Cutler is!

05:22.562 --> 05:24.313
Why are you saying "Cutler" like that?

05:24.314 --> 05:25.794
And I also don't know what is allowed

05:25.795 --> 05:27.595
in the Cold-Hearted Republic
of Nick Miller,

05:27.596 --> 05:28.596
but I do know how I feel.

05:28.597 --> 05:30.575
And I know how much you love cookies.

05:30.576 --> 05:32.355
And I saw it there behind the glass,

05:32.356 --> 05:34.596
and I thought, "Nick Miller...
I'm gonna buy him that."

05:34.597 --> 05:37.507
If I could give you
that cookie back, I would.

05:37.508 --> 05:39.575
Nothing would make me happier
than to throw it up,

05:39.576 --> 05:42.595
mash it into cookie-shape,
and shove it down your throat!

05:42.596 --> 05:45.588
- You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
- No, that's not...

05:45.589 --> 05:47.579
- You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
- No.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.575
You're not mama-birding
anybody any cookie.

05:49.576 --> 05:51.595
Schmidt, I don't want
to mama-bird you a cookie.

05:52.796 --> 05:54.074
What is your problem, Schmidt?

05:54.075 --> 05:56.533

want to spend her birthday here.

have made her dumber.

07:02.886 --> 07:04.366
Schmidt cares about you so much, man,

07:04.367 --> 07:05.767
and you don't even think about him.

07:05.768 --> 07:07.561
Are you being serious right now?

07:07.562 --> 07:10.511
Are you really
taking Schmidt's side on this?

07:10.512 --> 07:11.832

Nothing has changed, Nick.

07:23.648 --> 07:24.558
You think Schmidt is

You realize I say good
night to you every night,

07:28.588 --> 07:30.595

07:30.596 --> 07:33.508
- No.
- What is the problem, Nick?

07:33.511 --> 07:35.541
Do you not want me to have a good night?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.702
I can't just go around
saying good night to everyone,

07:37.703 --> 07:39.549
and buying people cookies.

07:39.550 --> 07:41.553
I am not a titan of finance, sir.

07:41.554 --> 07:44.528
Do you know, once a week he goes
into your room and cleans it,

07:44.529 --> 07:46.549
and then returns everything
the way he found it?

07:46.550 --> 07:49.670
- And I'm weird in this situation?
- The dirty old T-shirts, which he washes.

07:49.671 --> 07:52.071
I didn't ask for that... I like
living in my filthy messes.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.549
That's the point, man.
You didn't have to ask.

07:56.550 --> 07:59.266
Nobody buys people cookies for no reason.

07:59.267 --> 08:00.553
You still don't get it, do you?

08:00.554 --> 08:02.048
Nobody.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.849
That wasn't a cookie, damn it!
That was a...

08:03.850 --> 08:06.538
- What?
- Man, that was a piece of his heart.

08:06.541 --> 08:10.596
Now, if you don't mind,
good... night.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.537
I'm sorry, but in my defense,
Nadia just spent an hour

08:15.538 --> 08:18.537
explaining to me how to
drink vodka with my butt.

08:18.538 --> 08:20.578
You just embarrassed me
in front of my colleagues.

08:20.579 --> 08:22.739
Are you kidding me? It's not
like you work in the UN.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.595
You judge me for being a model.

08:24.596 --> 08:26.558
- Yes, I do.
- You always have.

08:26.559 --> 08:28.542
It's your birthday, and
you won't eat cake.

08:28.543 --> 08:30.561
Cece, you're better than
that; you really are.

08:30.562 --> 08:33.557
I just... I just feel
sorry for you sometimes.

08:33.558 --> 08:37.504
You feel sorry for me?

08:41.078 --> 08:42.541
You just hit me in the boob.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.992
- It was an accident.
- It was not an accident.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.520
Fine. It wasn't.

08:46.521 --> 08:48.570
My... God!

08:48.571 --> 08:50.541
Ho, ho.

08:50.542 --> 08:51.595
What?

08:51.596 --> 08:53.538
You want that?!

08:53.541 --> 08:56.512
Go. Just go.

08:56.513 --> 08:57.593
What you gonna do now,

08:57.594 --> 08:59.562
- Just...
- What?

08:59.565 --> 09:01.542
- What? What? What?
- What?

09:01.545 --> 09:02.567
- What? What?
- What?

09:06.517 --> 09:07.566
You should go.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.567
Thanks for a great birthday.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.566
Cece?

09:19.567 --> 09:20.583
You drink with mouth?

09:20.584 --> 09:22.583
Tonight, I drink with mouth.

09:26.538 --> 09:29.515
Well, guess who's not getting a turtle?

09:29.516 --> 09:30.550
They were out of turtles.

09:30.551 --> 09:33.549
I bought a tiny cowboy hat for nothing.

09:33.550 --> 09:36.525
- Schmidt's not talking to you right now.
- We're still on this?

09:36.528 --> 09:38.928
Schmidt is tired of doing things
for you that go unnoticed.

09:38.929 --> 09:40.889
Things like: lining your shoes
up at the door...

09:40.890 --> 09:42.690
Don't line my shoes up
at the door any more.

09:42.691 --> 09:45.171
- ...Recording your favorite TV shows...
- I appreciate that.

09:45.172 --> 09:47.612
- ...The turn-down service.
- The turn-down service is weird

09:47.613 --> 09:50.573
- And I never asked you to do that.
- Well, I guess those chocolate mints

09:50.574 --> 09:53.265
- Just disappeared on their own.
- I thought we weren't talking.

09:53.266 --> 09:54.866
- We're not.
- Then why do I hear words

09:54.867 --> 09:56.507
Coming out that stupid hole in your face?

09:56.508 --> 09:58.588
I'm a human being,
and I'm entitled to my emotions.

09:58.597 --> 09:59.970
Are you crying?

09:59.971 --> 10:01.549
No.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.531
Are you seriously crying, Schmidt?

10:03.532 --> 10:04.612
I'm not crying.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.596
Rough night, you guys.

10:12.597 --> 10:14.520
I forgot to take out my contacts.

10:14.521 --> 10:16.001
I think they're fused to my eyeballs.

10:18.542 --> 10:19.562
What's going on?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.498
Did you guys watch porn together again?

10:23.499 --> 10:24.579
Why do you keep doing that?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.525
It's always awkward.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.541
Wow.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.574
What the hell was that?

10:32.575 --> 10:34.532
In March, I will have been living

10:34.533 --> 10:36.520
with Schmidt for ten years.

10:36.521 --> 10:37.155
I know that

10:37.156 --> 10:38.596
because he sent me
an e-mail asking

10:38.597 --> 10:41.553
how I want to celebrate
our "tin anniversary."

10:41.554 --> 10:43.537
How did you guys become friends?

10:43.538 --> 10:44.536
Was it an accident?

10:44.537 --> 10:45.697
Did you hit him with your car

10:45.698 --> 10:47.552
and you became his reluctant caretaker?

10:47.553 --> 10:48.713
He lived in my freshman dorm.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.549
And one day, he was just there.

10:53.538 --> 10:55.531
Hey, hey, whoa, man,
what are you doing in here?

10:55.532 --> 10:56.533
That's my ramen.

10:56.534 --> 10:58.528
It's better this way.

10:58.529 --> 11:00.508
Y-You add water to it,
you weirdo.

11:00.509 --> 11:03.516
It's not a dry treat, it's a soup.

11:03.517 --> 11:04.567
- Who are you?
- Schmidt.

11:04.570 --> 11:06.537
You freak me out, man.

11:08.504 --> 11:10.520
This is cool.
We got a good vibe going, man.

11:10.521 --> 11:11.554
You're a super weird guy.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.570
Hey, sit there
while I throw things at you.

11:17.571 --> 11:18.596
- Body slam!
- No!

11:18.599 --> 11:20.520
Don't do this! No!

11:20.521 --> 11:22.541
And then he was always there.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.516
And the truth is, is,

11:25.517 --> 11:28.553
Schmidt loves me so much,

11:28.554 --> 11:31.499
and to be honest, Jess, it scares me.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.740
I mean, I don't think I deserve

11:32.741 --> 11:33.621
all of Schmidt's love.

11:33.622 --> 11:35.507
All I do is tease him.

11:35.508 --> 11:36.544
I mean, of course you do.

11:36.545 --> 11:38.508
That's all you can do.

11:38.509 --> 11:40.511
Do you think I'm a bad friend?

11:40.512 --> 11:42.574
No, no, I'm a bad friend.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.587
I got mad at Cece for being a model.

11:44.588 --> 11:46.507
It's a dumb thing to be.

11:46.508 --> 11:48.027
We got in a boob fight.

11:48.028 --> 11:50.948
- Feels like I fell forward on a treadmill.
- I'm just gonna say this...

11:50.949 --> 11:52.549
I find that arousing, and let's move on.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.590
Just, she's smart, you know,
and she's interesting

11:54.591 --> 11:56.631
and she could be doing
anything else with her life

11:56.632 --> 11:57.596
or at least trying.

11:57.597 --> 11:59.254
You know, the weird thing is,

11:59.255 --> 12:01.095
I was actually there
when she got discovered.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.499
You, take your glasses off.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
Okay.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.921
I can take my glasses off.

12:14.054 --> 12:16.024
I guess I was always disappointed

12:16.025 --> 12:18.032
with her for calling that lady.

12:18.033 --> 12:20.030
It's just, when I hear all the stuff

12:20.031 --> 12:21.071
about Cece's profession...

12:21.072 --> 12:24.070
like, the dieting...
it's crazy...

12:24.071 --> 12:26.011
and the butt drinking and the...

12:26.012 --> 12:27.727
Did you say "butt drinking"?

12:27.728 --> 12:29.328
- Yeah.
- You can't say "butt drinking"

12:29.329 --> 12:31.049
- And then not explain what it is.
- Yeah.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.570
It has two of my four favorite things.

12:32.571 --> 12:34.731
I just feel like we have
nothing in common, you know?

12:34.732 --> 12:35.033
Yeah.

12:35.034 --> 12:36.474
Do you ever wonder why we're friends

12:36.475 --> 12:38.049
with these people, Jess?

12:38.050 --> 12:40.373
And, worse, if we met them now,

12:40.374 --> 12:42.054
you think we'd still be friends with them?

12:42.055 --> 12:44.054
Maybe not.

12:46.004 --> 12:48.095
I should go talk to her.

12:50.033 --> 12:54.011
Well, Nick, I'm out of tears...
plumb out.

12:54.012 --> 12:58.007
All that's left is just yellowish goo.

12:58.008 --> 13:01.028
That's right, Nick... goo.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.045
That's a third of my life.

13:05.046 --> 13:06.096
Cece.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.041
Hey, Nadia, sorry.

13:09.042 --> 13:11.042
This Wilmer Valderrama.

13:14.075 --> 13:16.053
Nadia, that's not...

13:16.054 --> 13:21.024
I mean... or what I thought
he would look like

13:21.025 --> 13:23.020
in person.

13:23.021 --> 13:24.341
Nice to meet you.

13:24.342 --> 13:25.024
Big fan.

13:25.025 --> 13:26.019
Where's Cece?

13:26.020 --> 13:27.054
Cece drink too much.

13:27.055 --> 13:29.007
She puke, puke, puke.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.007
She puke,

13:30.008 --> 13:32.016
cry, puke, cry.

13:32.017 --> 13:33.037
She's so weak.

13:33.038 --> 13:36.028
You put on pajama, Wilmer Valderrama,

13:36.029 --> 13:38.020
top only.

13:38.021 --> 13:40.032
Then, you make me salad, bitch.

13:40.033 --> 13:43.032
Let's, let's get you into bed, okay?

13:43.033 --> 13:45.057
I don't think we're doing
any modeling today.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.011
No, I have to go, Jess, I have to go.

13:48.012 --> 13:50.070
It's my job, all right?

13:50.071 --> 13:51.096
You know what, Cece?

13:51.097 --> 13:54.011
I'm so sorry about last night.

13:54.012 --> 13:57.054
I know that you're...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.678
I know you're an intelligent person,

14:00.679 --> 14:02.079
and sometimes I just...

14:05.292 --> 14:07.092
I just get mixed up, you know,

14:07.095 --> 14:10.025
And I think that you're like me.

14:10.028 --> 14:12.066
Don't, don't worry, I'm here.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.147
Just tell me where to stand
and what we're selling.

14:14.148 --> 14:15.548
I'm gonna give it everything I got.

14:18.021 --> 14:19.054
I'm calling your agency.

14:19.055 --> 14:21.016
This is totally unprofessional.

14:21.017 --> 14:22.010
Don't call my agency.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.131
Just tell me where to stand.

14:23.132 --> 14:24.252
Up on the spinning platform.

14:24.253 --> 14:27.079
- Yeah, I can't do that.
- Okay.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.160
Please, no, seriously don't.
I can't lose this job.

14:29.161 --> 14:29.281
No.

14:29.282 --> 14:31.020
Don't call the agency, okay?

14:31.021 --> 14:33.021
- I'll do it.
- What?

14:33.024 --> 14:36.053
I'm actually a model, too,
mostly in Japan.

14:36.054 --> 14:41.016
They call me Giggle Bangs Rice Bowl.

14:41.017 --> 14:43.024
I know you're lying and I just don't care.

14:43.025 --> 14:45.032
Get over to hair and makeup now.

14:45.033 --> 14:47.008
Cool.

15:00.839 --> 15:02.003
These things are heavy.

15:02.004 --> 15:03.323
It's like chain mail on my eyes.

15:03.324 --> 15:05.444
So, your job is to highlight
the features of the car

15:05.445 --> 15:06.045
Gary describes.

15:06.046 --> 15:07.306
We need you to be fun
and sexy and American.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.067
Then he's gonna move
to the EcoBoost engine

15:09.068 --> 15:10.228
and the new interior styling.

15:10.229 --> 15:11.909
For the EcoBoost engine, give me something

15:11.910 --> 15:13.110
- mischievous.
- Mischievous.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.000
- Mischievous.
- Show me mischievous.

15:16.008 --> 15:17.248
Okay, and at the end, just say,

15:17.249 --> 15:18.999
"Ford. Go further."

15:19.000 --> 15:21.003
Do I have to wear those?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.684
Hey, everybody, my name's Gary, and I want

15:22.685 --> 15:27.020
to introduce you to the all-new
2013 Ford Fusion.

15:27.021 --> 15:30.028
Say hello to my good friend Jessica.

15:35.046 --> 15:38.024
The all-new Fusion
has been totally redesigned

15:38.025 --> 15:40.074
inside and out.

15:40.075 --> 15:43.028
All-new styling,
18-inch aluminum wheels,

15:43.029 --> 15:46.020
three-year,
bumper-to-bumper warranty,

15:46.021 --> 15:47.050
five-year power train,

15:47.051 --> 15:49.011
available Active Park,

15:49.012 --> 15:51.037
available lane-keeping system,

15:51.038 --> 15:54.070
standard voice-activated SYNC.

15:54.071 --> 15:56.078
Your co-workers will be jealous.

15:56.079 --> 16:00.011
From power plants that enhance efficiency

16:00.012 --> 16:02.016
the high-voltage
lithium-ion battery pack

16:02.017 --> 16:05.078
provides enough power to operate
in all-electric mode

16:05.079 --> 16:08.087
for short commutes... very smart.

16:08.088 --> 16:12.045
The Ford Fusion is designed
to be environmentally conscious.

16:12.046 --> 16:15.007
Fusion Hybrid and the Fusion
Energi are each powered

16:15.008 --> 16:18.041
by a combination
high-voltage electric motor

16:18.042 --> 16:22.041
that utilizes...
recycled material.

16:27.021 --> 16:30.037
The Fusion is available
with an EcoBoost engine...

16:30.038 --> 16:32.049
a hybrid,

16:32.050 --> 16:35.041
and a plug-in hybrid.

16:35.042 --> 16:39.016
The SE Hybrid is available
with eco-friendly cloth seating.

16:39.017 --> 16:43.020
No matter what color your
seats... ha!... they'll be green.

16:43.021 --> 16:46.020
Smoother rides, more fuel efficiency...

16:46.021 --> 16:47.999
Gary...

16:48.000 --> 16:49.560
The hybrid gets 47 miles to the gallon,

16:49.561 --> 16:51.401
so you're gonna be
filling up your tank less.

16:51.402 --> 16:52.042
Gary... Gary...!

16:52.045 --> 16:53.725
- When you do...
- I can't get out.

16:53.726 --> 16:55.166
Hey, man, it's your old pal Jessica.

16:55.167 --> 16:57.091
And it's not that difficult to get out.

16:57.092 --> 16:59.999
There's also the available
auto start-stop

17:00.000 --> 17:01.033
That...

17:01.036 --> 17:04.003
- Use the handle.
- What's happening?

17:04.007 --> 17:06.021
Further, go further.

17:11.003 --> 17:12.003
Hey.

17:14.025 --> 17:15.545
Schmidt, I got you something, man.

17:24.061 --> 17:27.002
They didn't have a
Jewish star at the store,

17:27.003 --> 17:28.849
so I got you a regular cookie

17:28.850 --> 17:31.050
and I made the star myself
by breaking off the pieces.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.020
It's meant to celebrate
your Jewish heritage.

17:34.021 --> 17:35.074
What is this?

17:35.075 --> 17:36.475
A Jewish star...
I just said that.

17:36.476 --> 17:38.067
- Hey, hey, Schmidt, just...
- This...

17:38.070 --> 17:42.016
Is so terrible!

17:42.017 --> 17:45.049
You gave me a cookie, I gave you a cookie.

17:45.050 --> 17:47.092
You gave me a cookie, gave you cookie.

17:48.792 --> 17:51.087
Gave me cookie, got you cookie!

17:51.088 --> 17:54.091
You gave me cookie, I got you cookie, man!

17:54.092 --> 17:56.049
Gave me cookie, got you cookie!

17:56.050 --> 17:58.083
We're even!
We're even, Schmidt!

17:59.088 --> 18:01.070
I mean, what do you want from me?

18:01.071 --> 18:03.061
What do you want, Schmidt?

18:03.062 --> 18:06.020
I've been racking my brain all day.

18:06.021 --> 18:08.091
I walked around the grocery store, man,

18:08.092 --> 18:10.999
for 45 minutes.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.200
I didn't know what to get you.

18:12.201 --> 18:14.201
And then I was thinking I
was gonna get you ramen

18:14.202 --> 18:17.011
like we used to eat, but
you probably eat, like,

18:17.012 --> 18:19.028
fancy ramen now with, like, figs in it.

18:19.029 --> 18:21.000
I don't know, man.

18:22.062 --> 18:25.007
You love me too much, Schmidt,

18:25.008 --> 18:27.000
and you picked the wrong guy.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.265
And when are you gonna get that

18:29.266 --> 18:31.096
through that giant head of yours?

18:33.071 --> 18:36.092
I'm just gonna let you down, man.

18:40.088 --> 18:42.028
Are you crying?

18:42.029 --> 18:44.028
I'm not crying, man.

18:44.029 --> 18:46.011
Yeah, you are crying.

18:46.012 --> 18:47.028
My God.

18:47.029 --> 18:48.469
I'm not crying, guys.
Just drop it.

18:48.470 --> 18:50.096
I just felt like I did something nice.

18:50.097 --> 18:51.952
Yes, you are, and that's okay.

18:51.953 --> 18:53.353
Don't say that, man, 'cause that...

18:53.354 --> 18:55.194
You know what I mean? Like...

18:55.195 --> 18:56.075
Just let it rain, man.

18:56.076 --> 18:58.007
I got you the cookie, Schmidt.

18:58.008 --> 18:59.128
It's the best I can do, man.

19:01.093 --> 19:02.588
What about the turtle?

19:04.592 --> 19:07.037
You're the only turtle I want.

19:07.738 --> 19:09.432
You're the turtle, man.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.011
I knew I was the turtle.

19:12.012 --> 19:15.011
Yeah, man, you're the turtle.

19:15.012 --> 19:16.042
I knew I was the turtle.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.032
You guys are the best, man.
I love you guys.

19:21.033 --> 19:23.041
I'm sorry, sorry, man.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.032
Hey, yeah.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.542
- I'm going to, 
- Yeah, I've got...

19:33.543 --> 19:35.503
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

19:35.504 --> 19:36.464
This is a good sandwich.

19:36.465 --> 19:39.054
- See you guys.
- This needed to happen.

19:39.057 --> 19:42.003
Wow, they gave you the, the huge lashes.

19:42.004 --> 19:43.124
Like, those are the magnums.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.165
Yeah, I actually like 'em.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.048
I think I'm just gonna keep 'em on.

19:46.049 --> 19:47.449
You're afraid to take the glue off.

19:47.450 --> 19:50.007
Yeah, I'm terrified.

19:50.008 --> 19:52.028
I'm really sorry about
what I said last night

19:52.029 --> 19:55.087
'cause... this is hard.

19:55.088 --> 19:57.070
It is just pointing at stuff,

19:57.071 --> 19:59.049
but it is... it's hard.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.092
Why is it so hard?

20:00.093 --> 20:02.095
You make it look a lot harder.

20:02.096 --> 20:04.095
No, you're brave.

20:04.096 --> 20:06.038
You've always been braver than me.

20:13.092 --> 20:16.053
Okay, what did you do to me last night?

20:16.054 --> 20:19.049
I mean, can you sprain someone's chest?

20:19.050 --> 20:21.049
You should see the other guys.

20:24.025 --> 20:26.004
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?

20:26.005 --> 20:28.003
I'm so full.

20:28.004 --> 20:29.404
This really is your best cake ever.

20:29.405 --> 20:30.588
Do you think so?

20:30.589 --> 20:31.588
We all think so.

20:31.589 --> 20:33.578
Hey, that's gross.

20:33.579 --> 20:35.542
- Get a fork, man.
- I got two

20:35.543 --> 20:37.529
Perfectly good forks
at the end of my arms.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.791
Hey, man, you do what you do.

20:38.792 --> 20:41.152
- Be you, man.
- I'd eat out of your hands, Nick.

20:41.153 --> 20:42.833
- Cake on your face.
- Petting zoo style.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.274
- Yeah, yeah.
- Cake all day.

20:44.275 --> 20:45.035
Talkin' about cake!

20:45.036 --> 20:46.916
- Frickin' cake dudes.
- Look at you.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.397
- Look at you. Frosting face.
- Hey.

20:48.398 --> 20:50.358
- Want cake on your face?
- I don't really care.

20:50.359 --> 20:53.541
Do you think, if we met today,
we would still be friends?

20:53.542 --> 20:55.342
I could watch you eat cake all day.

20:55.343 --> 20:56.529
Couple of guys eating cake.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.370
I'm gonna have to do
so much cardio tomorrow.

20:58.371 --> 21:00.582
I don't know, but we're friends now.

21:02.558 --> 21:04.570
Happy birthday, Cece.

21:04.571 --> 21:06.574
Man!
That's messy.

21:06.575 --> 21:08.575
- You like rap music?
- Yeah, sure do.

21:08.578 --> 21:11.529
- Who's your favorite rapper?
- Brian Austin Green.

21:11.532 --> 21:13.575
- He's cool.
- He's awesome.

21:13.578 --> 21:15.587
Go like this.

21:17.575 --> 21:20.532
Try to catch the Pop-Tart,
you big boy.

21:20.533 --> 21:21.596
Good, I love Pop-Tarts.

21:23.555 --> 21:24.567
Now close your eyes.

21:26.558 --> 21:28.504
- Did you get me?
- Yeah.

21:28.507 --> 21:29.571
- Good job.
- Ready?

21:32.562 --> 21:33.579
- Ready?
- Yeah.

21:34.082 --> 21:36.579
We did it!
