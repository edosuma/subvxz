00:18.417 --> 00:20.083
Sorry.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.417
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Who?

00:29.583 --> 00:31.875
Chef Moore,
he of the phoney accents.

00:32.042 --> 00:34.375
Hires me and then quits
to open his own place?

00:34.542 --> 00:37.083
Thank you very much.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.083
I don't see
any customers complaining.

00:39.292 --> 00:42.458
Hello. I am not a restauranteur.
I am a chef.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.875
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:45.042 --> 00:47.000
Are you wearing my dress?

00:47.125 --> 00:49.500
Hey, Brittany. I love that tattoo.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.667
- Thanks.
- I thought it was illegal to get them

00:51.833 --> 00:53.167
on your hand
because of the veins?

00:53.375 --> 00:56.667
In the States, yeah.
I got it done in Tahiti.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.875
Keep the change, Piper. I gotta jam.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.875
- Okay, say hi to Max.
- Okay.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.083
Table nine, please.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.417
Now back to my dress.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.500
Okay, see that poster boy
to your left?

01:16.667 --> 01:19.167
Just glance, don't be obvious.

01:19.458 --> 01:20.833
I approve. Who is he?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.333
His name is Alec,
and he's about to come over

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
and ask if he could buy me a martini.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.000
How do you know?

01:27.333 --> 01:29.833
Let's just say I solved
the age-old problem

01:30.000 --> 01:32.375
of who approaches whom first.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.042
- I had a little premonition.
- What?

01:35.167 --> 01:37.750
Phoebe, you're not supposed
to use your powers, we agreed.

01:37.958 --> 01:40.417
No, you and Prue agreed.
I abstained.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.750
Besides, it's not like I can control it.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.292
It just... It popped into my head.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.458
That's the whole point.
None of us can control our powers.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.208
That's what scares me. I could panic
and freeze the entire restaurant.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.042
Here he comes.

01:54.042 --> 01:56.167
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.750
I was just sitting over there,

01:57.833 --> 02:01.042
wondering if I could buy you
a martini or something?

02:01.208 --> 02:03.208
Martini. Imagine that.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.625
I would love one. It's Alec, right?

02:05.917 --> 02:07.792
Yeah. How'd you know my name?

02:08.208 --> 02:11.208
Wild guess.
Do you wanna grab a table?

02:11.750 --> 02:13.458
Prue is gonna be pissed.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.875
News flash: Stop worrying.
You'll get wrinkles.

03:24.042 --> 03:25.667
Prue?

04:56.583 --> 04:58.833
<i>Proving that they were
the devil's disciples</i>

04:59.042 --> 05:01.917
<i>was no easy task for the court
at the Salem witch trials.</i>

05:02.750 --> 05:04.708
<i>But a remarkable event occurred.</i>

05:04.917 --> 05:07.125
<i>One of the accused, Mary Easty,</i>

05:07.292 --> 05:10.250
<i>ran for the church
to profess her innocence.</i>

05:10.333 --> 05:13.083
<i>Suddenly, there was
a clap of thunder,</i>

05:13.333 --> 05:15.583
<i>and she was struck by
a bolt of lightning.</i>

05:15.750 --> 05:16.917
<i>In the court's mind,</i>

05:17.417 --> 05:19.042
<i>God himself had spoken,</i>

05:19.250 --> 05:22.917
<i>forbidding the evil witch
from even entering his house.</i>

05:23.083 --> 05:25.208
<i>The witches were subsequently
convicted of heresy</i>

05:25.375 --> 05:27.833
<i>- and burned alive at the stake.
- Morning.</i>

05:28.000 --> 05:29.583
- What are you watching?
- Nothing.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.875
- Just a show.
- About witches?

05:33.042 --> 05:35.667
Are you worried that we're gonna be
burned at the stake?

05:35.875 --> 05:39.083
Yeah, right. By the way, Andy called.

05:39.292 --> 05:41.292
- When?
- While you were in the shower.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.417
- What did you tell him?
- That you were in the shower.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.167
Bad date?

05:48.125 --> 05:49.625
No.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.375
No. No, not at all. It was great.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.792
You know, dinner, movie.

05:56.042 --> 05:57.542
- Sex.
- Excuse me?

05:58.042 --> 06:00.500
On your first date? You sleaze.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.167
It wasn't exactly our first date, Piper.

06:03.625 --> 06:06.542
High school doesn't count.
That was last decade. Spill it.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.000
- Oh, that bad, huh?
- No.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.917
Actually, that good. It was...

06:12.083 --> 06:14.083
Well, we were amazing.
But that's not that point.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.792
I told myself things
would be different.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.458
That we would take it slow.
It just shouldn't have happened.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.333
- What shouldn't?
- Prue slept with Andy.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.667
- Hello.
- Thanks a lot, mouth.

06:22.792 --> 06:25.417
Wait, you were gonna tell her
but not me? Family meeting.

06:25.625 --> 06:28.000
Speaking of last night,
what time did you end up rolling in?

06:28.125 --> 06:30.167
No, no, no.
Do not change the subject.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.333
- Don't dodge the question.
- It must've been at least after 3.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.000
I must still be on New York time.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.750
Actually, that would make it later.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.875
- Or maybe you and Alec...
- Who's Alec?

06:40.083 --> 06:42.042
Some hottie she hit on
in the restaurant.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.708
Excuse me, revisionist history.

06:43.917 --> 06:46.000
He hit on me.
Remember the whole vision thing?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.792
Vision thing?

06:48.042 --> 06:50.458
Please tell me you didn't
use your powers.

06:51.625 --> 06:52.833
Don't put me in the middle.

06:53.167 --> 06:56.333
I'm not, you were born in the middle.
Look, I thought that we agreed.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.833
No. We didn't. You agreed.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.042
You laid down the law.
There's a difference.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.750
Look, Phoebe,
our powers are not toys.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.250
We have to be careful.
They could get us killed.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.917
She's right, we don't want any more
warlocks finding us.

07:09.167 --> 07:13.000
Look, it was just a lousy premonition,
that's all. Nobody died.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.500
Besides, you guys can't control
your powers any better than I can.

07:16.625 --> 07:20.833
And, FYI, nothing happened
last night.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.958
At least nothing I'm ashamed of.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.708
There's another reason
we have to be careful.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.833
Andy thinks someone's
abducting women in our area.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.708
Abducting women,
what do you mean?

07:31.208 --> 07:35.042
It means that warlocks aren't the only
evil that we have to watch out for.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.708
And, FYI, I'm not ashamed
of anything.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.458
She didn't come home
at all last night.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.667
That's not like Brittany, believe me.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.750
Tell me, Max, what time did she leave
to go to Quake?

07:57.958 --> 07:59.875
Eight, 8:30.

08:00.083 --> 08:02.583
She called around 10,
said she was headed home.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.083
But I'm really worried.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.250
Chances are, she'll show up.
They usually do.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.542
In the meantime,
the best thing you can do right now

08:10.708 --> 08:13.375
is to go home in case she calls,
all right?

08:13.542 --> 08:16.125
- Will you do that?
- Yeah, okay.

08:16.292 --> 08:17.750
Thanks.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.250
Fourth one this week.

08:21.417 --> 08:25.458
Yeah, well, they can't just be
disappearing into thin air.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.833
You did something to your hair.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.000
At least we've narrowed down
his feeding pool

08:30.167 --> 08:31.583
to the area around the restaurant.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.457
Well, better tell your sweetie
to lock the door tonight.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.583
Pastor Williams.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.917
- Oh, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.583
Aren't you a little early?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.792
Dropping off the unused food
from your restaurant?

08:58.958 --> 09:01.042
I thought you weren't coming by
till this afternoon?

09:01.208 --> 09:06.458
Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm coming
back later with everything.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.333
Great. So, what are you
doing here now?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.833
Nothing, really. Just thinking.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.042
About?

09:16.458 --> 09:18.917
- Mary Easty.
- Who?

09:19.083 --> 09:22.042
It's just a stupid documentary I saw.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.417
By the way,

09:25.583 --> 09:30.750
is it true that evil beings can't go into
a church without being:

09:32.458 --> 09:35.625
Evil beings.
You mean, like, what, vampires?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.167
Vampires. No.

09:38.292 --> 09:42.167
I was thinking more
along the lines of witches.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.167
Witches, huh?

09:44.833 --> 09:46.833
Let me put it to you this way.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.250
I sure wouldn't wanna risk it.

09:49.542 --> 09:52.333
I gotta go. I'll see you later?

09:52.542 --> 09:53.875
Yeah. Right.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.792
Absolutely.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.042
Hold the doors.

10:53.583 --> 10:57.042
Damn it. Can you push 12, please?

10:57.708 --> 11:00.208
Here, let me help.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.583
Eighteenth-century French art.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.000
You work at the auction house?

11:04.208 --> 11:06.333
No, just interviewing,
if I ever get there on time.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.250
Don't wanna get my King Louises
mixed up.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.667
Hello?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.500
Andy, how did you get this number?

11:19.750 --> 11:23.333
I'm a detective, remember?
Prue, I think we should talk.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.292
Yeah, you know it's just that
I'm really late for this interview.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.083
I didn't mean for what happened
last night to happen, Prue.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.708
Of course, I'm, you know,
totally wrong for it anyway.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.958
Stuffy old auction house.
Don't know why they even called.

11:35.167 --> 11:36.083
<i>Come on, Prue.</i>

11:37.083 --> 11:39.875
<i>Listen to me. We've known
each other for a long time.</i>

11:40.125 --> 11:41.458
<i>We just couldn't help ourselves.</i>

11:41.667 --> 11:43.750
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know, Andy.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.000
<i>All we did was make love.</i>

11:46.167 --> 11:47.583
I know, Andy.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.542
Then talk to me,
help me out here, Prue.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.958
Why'd you sneak out like that?

11:51.458 --> 11:53.542
I did not sneak...

11:54.167 --> 11:55.458
...out.

11:55.667 --> 11:58.000
Right, you were asleep,
I didn't wanna wake you.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.833
And I did write you a note,
I just didn't leave it.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.042
Hello?

12:06.917 --> 12:08.375
Hello?

12:24.792 --> 12:26.750
Hey.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.208
Hey, it missed my...

12:31.000 --> 12:32.917
It skipped my floor.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.333
- Can't believe...
- Hit it again.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.125
That was strange.

12:41.375 --> 12:44.625
- Lucky you, huh?
- Yeah, I'm charmed, all right.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.375
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.958
Excuse me...

12:58.375 --> 12:59.792
...but aren't you Stefan?

13:00.708 --> 13:01.833
Yes.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.167
- I'm sorry, do we know each other?
- Highly doubtful.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.167
I'm just familiar with your work.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.875
Like everyone else in the world.

13:08.042 --> 13:09.417
Well, I don't know about that.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.500
But I'll always take a compliment
from a gorgeous woman.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.208
I'm sure your girlfriend
must appreciate that.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.875
She's not my girlfriend.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.750
Then why are you whispering?

13:18.958 --> 13:20.292
Excuse me.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.833
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be in the car.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.583
Well, it was really nice meeting you.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.292
You too. Listen, listen.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.542
I'm in town for a couple of days
doing a Porsche shoot.

13:28.750 --> 13:32.417
If you're interested, stop by.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.458
I would love to photograph you.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.000
You do model, don't you?

13:37.125 --> 13:38.875
In my dreams, yeah.

13:46.958 --> 13:48.833
A driver called in sick,
can you do a delivery?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.708
Sure. Is that guy at the bar
staring at me?

13:51.875 --> 13:53.667
A lot of guys at the bar
are staring at you.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.917
The one at the far end.
Tall, dark, brooding.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.375
Very New York.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.542
Sorry, no.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.083
He's seen your résumé
and is very impressed.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.958
Although I have to tell you,
he's already blown out six applicants.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.542
I still don't know why he's interested.
I never even applied.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.167
He likes what you did
at the museum.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.292
Even though your ex-boss
trashed you.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.375
I mean, what's Roger
got against you anyway?

14:17.542 --> 14:20.375
Hard to say, unless shattering
his male ego counts for something.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.667
He's also my ex-fiancé.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.667
Got it. You ready?

14:24.792 --> 14:26.625
Yeah.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.250
Rex Buckland, this is Prue Halliwell,

14:30.542 --> 14:32.417
interviewing for the new specialist.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.583
Actually, we've already met.

14:34.750 --> 14:38.125
But welcome to my
stuffy old auction house.

15:03.417 --> 15:07.042
Please, I beg you, don't hurt me.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.958
Let me go! Please, Stefan.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.500
It's Javna.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.000
Oh, my God. Wait!

15:50.208 --> 15:52.208
How many exhibitions
did you curate?

15:52.333 --> 15:53.958
Seven, including the Carlton estate.

15:54.042 --> 15:55.708
It should be on my résumé.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.375
Franklin Carlton.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.708
That's quite a coup.

16:00.958 --> 16:03.750
I tend to be on the persistent side.
I usually get what I want.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.500
I don't doubt it.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.625
It's a shame, though,
that you think you're...

16:08.750 --> 16:11.375
How did you put it in the elevator?

16:11.542 --> 16:13.500
"Totally wrong for the job."

16:13.667 --> 16:15.583
That was a private
phone conversation.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.708
Hardly.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.917
You called me, remember?
Not the other way around.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.208
While we're at it,
it's incredibly unfair of you

16:25.417 --> 16:27.667
to eavesdrop on a private call
and then misjudge me,

16:27.833 --> 16:30.167
based entirely on what
you thought you heard.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.208
I apologise. It was unfair of me.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.083
I'm new at all this.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.792
I've only just taken over the house
from my father,

16:40.917 --> 16:43.583
so I'm very protective of it.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.583
But, you know, I liked what you did
at the museum,

16:46.750 --> 16:48.958
attracting a younger market.

16:49.083 --> 16:52.417
I mean, it's totally consistent
with what I wanna do here.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.833
It's just that, you know,
all these qualifications aside,

16:56.083 --> 16:58.583
it's very important to me
that whoever I hire

16:58.792 --> 17:00.750
truly wants to be here.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.625
<i>- Yeah?
- Excuse me, Mr Buckland.</i>

17:02.833 --> 17:04.416
<i>Your next interview is waiting.</i>

17:04.583 --> 17:06.041
<i>Should I reschedule him?</i>

17:07.416 --> 17:09.375
No, I think we're done here.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.916
Well, thanks for your time.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.166
My area of expertise ranges
from Ming dynasty

17:26.333 --> 17:28.333
to a Mark McGwire
rookie baseball card.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.083
You name it, I can identify it.

17:31.292 --> 17:35.333
Now, I may not have sought
this job originally, but I do want it.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.792
And I am definitely right for it.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.083
You would think after last night

17:51.292 --> 17:53.000
Prue would be a lot mellower.

17:53.125 --> 17:57.500
I mean, how long had it been?
Six months? And she's worse.

17:57.667 --> 18:01.208
It's just so un-Prue-like
to have sex on the first date.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.667
I mean, everything's changing
since we've become...

18:03.833 --> 18:05.333
- Great, thank you.
- You know.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.833
Come on, you never had sex
on the first date?

18:08.167 --> 18:10.000
No. Have you?

18:10.375 --> 18:13.375
- Don't answer that.
- Well, it's not a regular thing.

18:13.542 --> 18:14.833
Of course, now that I'm a witch,

18:15.042 --> 18:17.625
I can see if it's gonna be
any good or not before it actually...

18:17.792 --> 18:19.292
Hi.

18:20.042 --> 18:22.208
What's the matter with you,
are you out of your mind?

18:22.583 --> 18:24.625
Come on, it's not like
he took me literally.

18:24.792 --> 18:27.833
You don't know that. He could've.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.708
I just think we need to be
extra careful.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.542
In bed and out.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.750
Okay, well, there's careful,
and then there's paranoid.

18:37.667 --> 18:41.292
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

18:42.542 --> 18:45.042
Hey, Phoebe, I didn't know
you were back in town.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.375
Hey.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.583
Take a bite out of the Big Apple,
did you?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.750
I ate the worm.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.792
I'm gonna get some gum.
You guys want anything?

18:52.958 --> 18:54.250
- No, thanks.
- Good to see you.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.917
You too.

19:04.292 --> 19:05.875
Okay, here's the deal.

19:06.083 --> 19:09.583
I've got this friend.
Has a little problem, could be bad.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.833
Not quite sure what to tell her.

19:12.042 --> 19:13.542
- You wanna go inside?
- No.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.833
I mean, I've gotta get going.

19:16.292 --> 19:18.333
So, what's her problem?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.833
Well, she kind of,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.833
sort of thinks she might be a witch.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.958
Witches again, huh?

19:28.125 --> 19:30.042
It's not a good thing, is it?

19:30.208 --> 19:33.000
Certainly not a question
I get every day.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.583
How well do you remember
your Sunday school lessons?

19:35.792 --> 19:38.417
Exodus 22:18.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.583
Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.

19:41.833 --> 19:44.917
- Meaning?
- If you go by the old school,

19:45.125 --> 19:47.458
it means put her to death.
She's evil.

19:55.083 --> 19:58.542
- Here you go.
- $3.52.

19:58.708 --> 20:01.042
Should we use
the grandchildren's birthdays?

20:03.250 --> 20:06.042
It's a $10 million jackpot.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.792
Who knows, I mean,
today may be our lucky day.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.833
- It may be.
- If not,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.500
we're gonna lose our house.

20:20.375 --> 20:25.292
Four, 16, 19, 30, 32 and 40.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.875
Those are the winning numbers.

20:27.042 --> 20:30.250
Yeah, yeah. Right, lady.
You want this stuff, or don't you?

20:30.417 --> 20:35.250
Four, 16, 19, 30, 32, and 40.

20:35.417 --> 20:38.625
Trust me, mister,
today is your lucky day.

20:40.292 --> 20:44.833
You know, I think I'll buy
one of these lottery tickets too.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.500
Ready? Let's go.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.875
- What are you smiling about?
- Nothing.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.750
What do you want me to say?

21:08.917 --> 21:12.083
Something just does not feel
right to me about this. I can't help it.

21:12.958 --> 21:16.500
- Here we go again.
- I mean, where are they, right?

21:16.667 --> 21:19.000
What's this guy doing
with these poor women?

21:19.167 --> 21:21.500
Thinking alien abduction, are you?

21:22.500 --> 21:23.875
I'm serious, Morris.

21:24.542 --> 21:27.000
I know. That's what scares me.

21:27.708 --> 21:30.208
Let me guess.
Favourite movie growing up.

21:30.542 --> 21:33.000
<i>Ghostbusters? Am I right?</i>

21:34.167 --> 21:37.000
Look, we got a crazy, Trudeau.

21:37.167 --> 21:40.292
Likes the pretty ladies.
That's it, the end.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.833
If he comes back looking for more,
we're gonna grab him, tag him,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.500
make the world a safer place.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.708
That too hard to follow?

21:51.792 --> 21:53.208
<i>Evil Dead 2.</i>

21:56.708 --> 21:59.000
Favourite movie growing up,
just for the record.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.792
Bank across the street. I think we
should grab the ATM tapes and see...

22:08.250 --> 22:11.042
Whoa. Where you going?

22:12.375 --> 22:16.167
No, no. Forget it, Romeo.
You're not blowing our cover.

22:16.375 --> 22:19.292
Come on, Morris, cut me some slack.
I have to talk to her.

22:20.750 --> 22:24.292
Please? Five minutes,
that's all I need.

22:32.625 --> 22:33.958
Cindy, come on, your salmon's up.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.042
Hector, way behind,
we need clean plates.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.375
You didn't give Andy
my cell phone number, did you?

22:39.542 --> 22:41.667
- No, why?
- Never mind.

22:41.833 --> 22:44.208
Remind me, I wanted to do this
for a living, right?

22:44.417 --> 22:47.208
Looks like you're the only one
who'll be doing anything for a living.

22:47.417 --> 22:48.542
I think I blew my interview.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.792
I can't imagine you were
less than stellar.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.500
- What is Phoebe doing here?
- Flirting.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.042
Yeah, and she's wearing Armani.
Where did she get that?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.458
Not from my closet.

22:59.042 --> 23:00.833
Gotta go.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.750
Prue, hi. This is my other sister.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.500
Prue, this is Stefan,
the photographer.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.708
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.250
Nice dress.

23:13.417 --> 23:14.875
Don't worry, it's not yours.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.792
I know, I could never afford it.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.750
Will you excuse me for one minute?

23:19.917 --> 23:21.750
I'll be right back.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.333
You charged it?
How are you gonna pay?

23:31.458 --> 23:33.000
- You're broke.
- Not for long.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.333
What does that mean?

23:35.250 --> 23:37.458
- You didn't use your powers again.
- Maybe.

23:37.625 --> 23:38.833
Are you telling me you haven't?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.917
No, I'm not telling you that, but
we're not talking about me, are we?

23:42.333 --> 23:45.167
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Same thing we do at home.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.500
What, did you go to the track,
play the market, what?

23:47.917 --> 23:49.375
- The lottery.
- Phoebe!

23:49.583 --> 23:52.125
What did you want me to do,
ignore the premonition?

23:52.292 --> 23:53.583
Not help a needy family?

23:53.750 --> 23:55.750
That's what we're supposed
to do, right?

23:55.917 --> 23:59.292
No, we are not supposed to use
our powers for our own personal gain.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.167
<i>That is what it says in
the Book of Shadows.</i>

24:01.417 --> 24:03.833
- Not so loud.
- You said we needed money, right?

24:03.958 --> 24:05.833
- Well, I'm getting some.
- Come on, you guys.

24:06.042 --> 24:09.375
- So get a job like everybody else.
- I'm using my mind instead.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.375
Prue.

24:13.208 --> 24:14.875
Watch it!

24:15.208 --> 24:17.708
Oh, no. No, no, no.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.833
- Not again.
- Now look at what you've done.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.833
This is my fault?

24:22.042 --> 24:25.000
- You guys aren't frozen?
- Guess it doesn't work on witches.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.833
Piper, how long does it last?

24:27.417 --> 24:30.542
I don't know. Not long.

24:30.792 --> 24:34.542
- It doesn't work out there either.
- Oh, tell me this isn't happening.

24:43.083 --> 24:46.417
Calm down, it's okay.
It's all gonna be okay.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.542
God. Andy's partner came in,
and he's headed this way.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.125
- What are we gonna do?
- Stall him.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.667
Hey, Inspector Morris, right?

24:58.917 --> 25:00.417
That's right. Is Trudeau in there?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.542
- Andy? I don't know, is he?
- Hostess said he...

25:02.750 --> 25:04.458
Okay, breathe, Piper, breathe.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.250
- Excuse me.
- I have not...

25:06.458 --> 25:08.125
Wait.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.250
I really think we should...

25:11.417 --> 25:12.917
...talk.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.917
What are you doing here?
I had five minutes.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.917
Yeah, I gave you ten.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.917
How...?

25:19.250 --> 25:22.458
Guys, you know,
we're really busy in here.

25:22.625 --> 25:26.333
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll call you later, I promise.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.042
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.042
Bye.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.917
I hate being a witch.

26:11.625 --> 26:14.292
Hey. What are you doing?

26:15.292 --> 26:17.333
Reading. Thinking.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.417
About what?

26:20.542 --> 26:24.000
About how totally screwed we are
now that we're witches.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.542
Oh, that.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.417
You don't understand.
You don't think we are.

26:31.792 --> 26:34.792
You're never afraid of anything.

26:34.958 --> 26:37.125
I envy that about you, always have.

26:37.833 --> 26:40.958
Yeah, well, don't, because
it gets me into trouble sometimes.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.208
Piper, talk to me.

26:45.625 --> 26:46.792
I don't know.

26:46.958 --> 26:50.667
It's just, our whole lives,
we've been like everybody else.

26:50.875 --> 26:55.875
Rushing off to work, going out
on bad dates, buying shoes.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Then, suddenly,
we wake up one day

26:59.167 --> 27:02.042
and everything is different.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.375
We're witches now.

27:04.542 --> 27:07.417
I don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.625
Are you kidding? It's a great thing.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.708
We don't know that.

27:11.875 --> 27:14.667
We don't know anything
about these powers.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.833
Why we have them,
what they mean,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.625
where they even come from.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.417
I mean, how do we know it's not...?

27:24.792 --> 27:26.875
How do we know it's not from evil?

27:27.917 --> 27:30.917
Piper, we've been through this.
We're good witches.

27:31.042 --> 27:33.750
How do we know?
What about Jeremy?

27:33.917 --> 27:37.375
What about all the other warlocks
he said would be coming after us?

27:37.542 --> 27:39.792
How do we know
we're not just like them?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.792
That is what scares me.
We don't know.

27:46.542 --> 27:48.458
I just...

27:50.208 --> 27:52.625
I just wanna be normal again,

27:52.750 --> 27:54.542
as messed up as that was.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.750
Is that too much to ask for?

27:59.750 --> 28:01.792
Piper, listen to me.

28:02.500 --> 28:08.250
You are the sweetest,
most caring person I have ever met.

28:09.417 --> 28:11.042
No, I mean that, you are.

28:12.042 --> 28:15.083
You're always there to help anybody,
even strangers.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.083
You've been doing it your whole life.

28:17.417 --> 28:20.708
So there's no way that
you've been given this...

28:22.458 --> 28:24.792
This gift...

28:24.958 --> 28:26.875
...if it wasn't to do good things with it.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.750
To protect the innocent,

28:29.958 --> 28:32.375
<i>just like the Book of Shadows says.</i>

28:33.958 --> 28:36.333
Besides, if anyone should be
concerned with being bad,

28:36.500 --> 28:37.792
it's me, right?

28:41.875 --> 28:43.708
You've got nothing to be afraid of.

28:46.917 --> 28:49.000
I gotta run.

28:49.167 --> 28:52.167
I am going to get my picture taken.

29:04.167 --> 29:06.500
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.833
- Look...
- Andy.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.833
- You go first.
- Go ahead.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.500
I'm not sorry it happened, Prue.

29:20.208 --> 29:22.583
Well, I have to be honest with you,
Andy, I am.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.917
I mean, not because I didn't enjoy it.

29:28.792 --> 29:31.083
I did. Especially the...

29:31.417 --> 29:32.708
Yeah, that was great.

29:32.917 --> 29:34.458
Yeah.

29:34.667 --> 29:38.208
And, of course, there was the...

29:38.458 --> 29:40.375
That was nice too.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.833
Yeah, but, you know,
that's not the point.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.500
It's...

29:45.542 --> 29:48.875
I haven't seen you
in almost seven years...

29:50.208 --> 29:52.708
...and to start right back
where we left off is...

29:52.875 --> 29:55.458
I know, I know, believe me.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.208
I just wanna know why you left,
that's all.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.083
Why can't you tell me?
What's the big secret?

30:02.250 --> 30:04.875
- Believe me, you don't wanna know.
- Try me.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.000
Well...

30:09.083 --> 30:12.917
...my life, it's gotten
a little complicated.

30:14.708 --> 30:18.375
And I just don't think that I should
get involved in anything right now.

30:19.042 --> 30:20.583
Prue,

30:20.750 --> 30:23.750
we had sex. It doesn't mean
we have to elope.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.458
Okay.

30:29.833 --> 30:31.542
How about this?

30:32.042 --> 30:34.708
Why don't we just pretend
like it never happened?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.542
Do you want me to toss you
a life preserver now

30:37.708 --> 30:40.792
or just let you sink on your own?

30:40.958 --> 30:43.125
No, no. I'm serious.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.583
We'll just count that one
as part of our old relationship.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.667
We'll slow down, we'll start over.

30:50.708 --> 30:53.667
Prue, we've been given
a second chance here.

30:53.833 --> 30:55.958
I don't wanna blow it this time.

30:59.042 --> 31:02.375
- Dating in the '90s.
- Excuse me.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.542
Hello?

31:07.667 --> 31:11.250
Yeah, absolutely,
I'm sure that I can make that.

31:11.417 --> 31:12.417
Okay, thanks.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.292
That was the auction house.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.625
They want me to come back in
for a second interview.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.958
I've gotta go.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.792
Just give me a little time
to think things through, okay?

31:36.167 --> 31:37.917
I have nothing to be afraid of.

31:38.083 --> 31:39.583
I have nothing to be afraid of.

31:39.750 --> 31:43.417
Nothing. Nothing to be afraid of.

31:44.958 --> 31:46.292
Nothing.

32:45.500 --> 32:46.750
I'm good!

33:06.750 --> 33:10.083
- Brittany?
- You know me?

33:10.208 --> 33:11.375
Is that my name?

33:16.958 --> 33:18.417
Prue, thank you for coming back.

33:18.583 --> 33:21.583
Well, thanks for having me back,
although I must admit I didn't expect it.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.250
I told you I was interested,
and I am.

33:23.417 --> 33:26.958
But first of all, I'd just like to test
your expertise, if you don't mind.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.917
Let's see how good your really are.
Careful, watch your step.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.417
This is Hannah Webster,
one of our assistant specialists.

33:32.625 --> 33:36.250
- This is Prue Halliwell.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.958
Please, tell us about this piece.

33:42.292 --> 33:44.750
<i>Well, Madonna of the Meadow.</i>

33:44.917 --> 33:47.167
Giovanni Bellini, 16th century.

33:47.375 --> 33:48.833
Fabulous piece.

33:48.958 --> 33:51.333
Worth $3, 4 million easily
if it wasn't a copy.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.917
What makes you think it's a copy?

33:54.375 --> 33:56.417
Too well-preserved. No yellowing.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.833
Besides, the frame support is in pine,

33:58.958 --> 34:02.292
and Italian painters
used poplar back then.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.292
What about this one?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.625
Degas.

34:09.792 --> 34:13.458
Actually, this was the only sculpture
he exhibited himself.

34:14.625 --> 34:16.167
Watch out.

34:25.042 --> 34:27.083
You okay?

34:27.250 --> 34:28.833
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.375
You sure? I'm sorry.
I can't believe that happened.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.083
No, it's okay.

34:34.292 --> 34:39.000
Well, I really don't know what to say.

34:39.167 --> 34:42.375
Except you're hired,
if you still want the job.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
- Are you serious?
- Can you start Monday?

34:44.792 --> 34:47.708
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Terrific. It's done, then.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.333
Yeah, we can sort out the details
when you come in.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.708
In the meantime, welcome aboard.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.417
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.542
Well, what do you think?

35:03.250 --> 35:06.625
I think either she's
the luckiest woman alive,

35:06.792 --> 35:07.958
or she's a witch.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.250
Piper? Phoebe?

35:15.417 --> 35:18.000
- Guess what.
- What?

35:18.167 --> 35:20.167
Prue, thank God you're home.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.042
Yeah, who...?

35:23.208 --> 35:26.750
Here you go, Brittany. Why don't you
go sit down at the table, okay?

35:26.917 --> 35:29.042
There you go.

35:29.250 --> 35:30.458
Sorry, Brittany?

35:30.625 --> 35:32.958
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm not sure I do.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.250
I think... No, I know.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.792
This woman is Brittany Reynolds.

35:37.958 --> 35:39.792
Yeah, right, Piper,
and I'm Rosie O'Donnell.

35:39.958 --> 35:42.750
No, I mean it.
Brittany has a tattoo, right?

35:42.917 --> 35:45.542
An angel on her
right hand, remember?

35:47.250 --> 35:49.250
- That can't be.
- That's what I thought at first.

35:49.417 --> 35:51.417
But then I started asking her
some questions,

35:51.583 --> 35:54.000
things only Brittany would know.

35:54.208 --> 35:57.708
She may be senile,
but it was enough to convince me.

36:16.125 --> 36:19.125
Stefan, it's me, Phoebe.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.458
Piper, what are you talking about?

36:44.667 --> 36:48.375
<i>I'm telling you, I saw something
about it in the Book of Shadows.</i>

36:49.125 --> 36:50.792
Okay, look, see.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.833
"Javna feeds one week
out of every year,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.625
stealing the life force
from the young."

36:54.833 --> 36:57.833
"By invoking a black-magic power
of the evil eye to gain eternal youth."

36:58.000 --> 36:59.542
It's gotta be what happened
to Brittany.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.292
Yeah, but there must be some
incantation to reverse it somehow.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.792
There is.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.208
The Hand of Fatima.

37:05.417 --> 37:08.917
It says that the prophet Muhammad
invoked it centuries ago

37:09.167 --> 37:12.917
to banish Javna back
to wherever the hell he came from.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.667
Yeah, well, the problem is,
we don't know who Javna really is,

37:15.833 --> 37:17.042
let alone where he is.

37:31.042 --> 37:32.833
Brittany?

37:35.042 --> 37:37.208
Oh, my God. What happened?

37:37.333 --> 37:39.417
- Brittany, are you all right?
- I'll call 911.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.917
And tell them what,
that she's dying of old age at 25?

37:42.083 --> 37:43.125
What is it?

37:43.292 --> 37:46.125
It's a cocktail napkin
from my restaurant.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.417
With Stefan's address on the back.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.250
Javna.

37:51.417 --> 37:54.875
Prue, that's where Phoebe went.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.375
Look at this, ATM tape
caught the first victim.

37:57.542 --> 38:00.000
And she's leaving with
that photographer, Stefan.

38:00.208 --> 38:03.000
Yeah, jives with the last place
she was seen before she disappeared.

38:03.167 --> 38:04.875
Is he on our suspect list?

38:05.042 --> 38:06.625
Just moved to the top.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.875
God bless ATMs.

38:14.125 --> 38:18.417
Please, Stefan,
or whoever you are, let me go.

38:20.083 --> 38:23.000
It's Javna.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.375
- You see anything?
- No.

38:38.542 --> 38:40.250
- Prue.
- Look, we'll find her.

38:40.417 --> 38:41.750
Maybe we should call the police.

38:41.917 --> 38:44.000
If Javna has her,
only we can stop him.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.375
But we need Phoebe to do it.

38:45.583 --> 38:48.000
The incantation only works
with the three of us.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.292
Piper.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.750
We need you. We don't have
a lot of time, okay?

39:21.292 --> 39:23.083
Prue, grab the mirror!

39:28.625 --> 39:29.625
Now.

39:29.750 --> 39:32.625
<i>Evil eyes look unto thee
May they soon extinguished be</i>

39:32.792 --> 39:34.375
<i>Bend thy will to the power of three</i>

39:34.542 --> 39:36.292
<i>Eye of earth, evil and accursed</i>

39:36.792 --> 39:37.792
You can't stop me.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.625
I will live forever.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.167
No!

39:42.333 --> 39:45.667
<i>Evil eyes look unto thee
May they soon extinguished be</i>

39:45.917 --> 39:47.458
<i>Bend thy will to the power of three</i>

39:47.625 --> 39:49.667
<i>Eye of earth, evil and accursed</i>

40:35.125 --> 40:37.583
Very cool.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.625
What the hell? Prue?

40:48.167 --> 40:49.500
What are you doing here?

40:49.708 --> 40:52.833
Well, we were just trying
to get the van started.

40:53.042 --> 40:55.208
Yeah, Phoebe called,
she was having car trouble.

40:55.375 --> 40:58.042
Stefan was gonna take
some pictures of me.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.125
Do you have any idea how lucky
you are? This guy's the stalker.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.542
No sign of him inside.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.542
His car's here,
so he might still be around.

41:04.708 --> 41:06.458
Stay with them.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.667
Excuse me.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.750
Hey, how about that? You fixed it.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.083
How about that?

41:19.208 --> 41:20.500
Maybe we should go.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.333
Good idea.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.208
Thanks.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.875
Call me?

41:32.583 --> 41:34.042
Sure.

41:47.458 --> 41:49.125
Excuse me.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.292
Excuse me.

41:51.458 --> 41:54.792
Hey, how are you?

41:59.417 --> 42:00.667
Do you know that girl?

42:00.833 --> 42:03.792
I almost was that girl.
She was one of Stefan's victims.

42:03.958 --> 42:05.500
Obviously doesn't remember.

42:05.583 --> 42:08.500
- Lucky her.
- No, lucky me.

42:08.667 --> 42:11.000
I learned my lesson.
I've got to be more careful.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.000
Excuse me, did I just hear right?

42:14.208 --> 42:16.333
Did she actually admit
to doing something wrong?

42:16.500 --> 42:19.333
- That's what I heard.
- Frame it, it won't happen again.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.625
At least we helped those people.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.125
I mean, it's nice to know
our powers really are good.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.333
Yeah, good for everything
but our love lives, unfortunately.

42:28.833 --> 42:31.958
Although I must admit,
they do come in handy once in a while.

42:33.042 --> 42:34.292
Hypocrite.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.500
<i>And last night's
winning lotto numbers were</i>

42:36.667 --> 42:38.542
<i>- four, 16...
- The winning numbers.</i>

42:38.708 --> 42:40.250
I won.

42:40.833 --> 42:42.833
Well, I did.

42:47.667 --> 42:50.792
See, I told you.
You can't intentionally use the powers

42:50.958 --> 42:52.958
for your own personal gain,
remember?

42:53.125 --> 42:55.917
It's a good thing I didn't take the tags
off that dress.

42:56.167 --> 42:59.167
Oh, well, at least the old couple
didn't lose their house.

42:59.667 --> 43:01.500
A toast, to the power of three.

43:01.667 --> 43:03.500
Whether we like it or not.
