00:22.994 --> 00:23.961
What are you doing?

00:24.479 --> 00:26.713
I'm writing... my will.

00:26.781 --> 00:30.652
After I'm gone, I don't want you
and Bear fighting over my shit.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.320
Or any of my other stuff.

00:32.387 --> 00:34.123
Planning on going somewhere?

00:34.191 --> 00:37.162
We all go some time, mate.

00:37.229 --> 00:38.663
How's it coming?

00:38.731 --> 00:40.332
Let's see.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.469
Uh, they're saying
Jenna violated her contract

00:42.536 --> 00:44.872
by fondling her breasts
on a live newscast

00:44.939 --> 00:46.974
while wrecked out
of her mind on drugs.

00:47.042 --> 00:50.045
What they don't realize is...

00:50.113 --> 00:51.580
nothing.

00:51.648 --> 00:53.381
They realize everything.

00:53.449 --> 00:56.286
But she didn't know she
ate candy with pot in it.

00:56.353 --> 00:59.056
She still doesn't. Ignorance
is nine tenths of the law.

00:59.124 --> 01:01.225
- That's possession. - She wasn't
charged with possession, Ryan.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.728
I thought you were
a good lawyer.

01:03.795 --> 01:06.665
How did you win all those
cases at your father's firm?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.133
I cheated.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.277
Go on.

01:16.345 --> 01:18.546
I prepared two files.

01:18.614 --> 01:21.916
One with a solid
legal strategy.

01:21.984 --> 01:25.954
And if that didn't work,
I'd go to my black file.

01:27.856 --> 01:30.692
It was filled with... whatever
dark secrets I could find

01:30.759 --> 01:32.594
and use against the opposition.

01:32.662 --> 01:35.865
Great! So where's the
black file for this case?

01:35.933 --> 01:38.201
There isn't going to be one.

01:38.269 --> 01:39.702
I did terrible things, Wilfred.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.170
I messed with peoples' lives.

01:41.238 --> 01:43.039
I'm not going there again.

01:43.107 --> 01:45.841
Don't be a pussy. This is
your chance to get Jenna.

01:45.909 --> 01:47.877
- She's engaged.
- No. She's thinking about it.

01:47.945 --> 01:49.713
That's like worse
than a "no."

01:49.781 --> 01:51.448
Well, so you're saying

01:51.516 --> 01:53.284
if I save Jenna's job,
she'll dump Drew for me?

01:53.351 --> 01:57.655
Ryan, you've seen
what I'm capable of.

01:57.723 --> 02:00.692
You do whatever it
takes to win, just this once,

02:00.759 --> 02:03.228
and I'll do whatever it takes
to get you Jenna.

02:03.296 --> 02:05.630
There is no "just this once."

02:05.698 --> 02:08.733
You do one bad thing,
and it leads to another,

02:08.800 --> 02:11.536
and before you know it, you're
forgetting who you really are.

02:11.604 --> 02:13.605
It's a slippery slope.

02:13.672 --> 02:17.508
It's only slippery if you don't
have someone to hold on to.

02:17.576 --> 02:19.778
Why are you here?

02:19.845 --> 02:21.746
Excuse me?

02:21.814 --> 02:24.148
I always figured you were
looking out for me, but now

02:24.216 --> 02:26.384
you want me to do something
I know is bad for me.

02:26.451 --> 02:28.953
You're tired.
Why don't you

02:29.021 --> 02:31.022
- call it a night...?
- I need some answers, Wilfred.

02:31.090 --> 02:32.490
I can't keep ignoring the fact

02:32.558 --> 02:34.993
that none of this
makes any sense!

02:35.062 --> 02:36.929
Can we take the emotion
out of this, please?

02:36.997 --> 02:38.731
Can we just be two adults
having a conversation?

02:38.799 --> 02:40.266
What are you?

02:40.334 --> 02:41.500
<i>Who are you?</i>

02:41.568 --> 02:43.236
<i>Why are you?</i>

02:43.304 --> 02:45.939
I can't tell you.

02:46.006 --> 02:48.642
- Why not?
- They're listening.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.078
What? Who?

02:51.145 --> 02:53.146
Shh, shh, shh.

02:57.752 --> 02:59.853
♪ ♪

03:02.924 --> 03:06.526
Are you sure you want to know?

03:06.594 --> 03:08.261
Yeah, this is a joke.

03:08.329 --> 03:10.531
It's not.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.434
Ryan, remember the
night before we met?

03:14.502 --> 03:16.069
The pills you took?

03:16.137 --> 03:18.705
Yes.

03:18.773 --> 03:21.408
They worked, mate.

03:23.945 --> 03:26.279
I'm sorry, Ryan. They worked.

03:26.347 --> 03:28.014
You must have noticed

03:28.082 --> 03:30.884
things here are different.

03:30.952 --> 03:33.687
Shit's a little off, right?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.422
Am I...?

03:35.490 --> 03:37.024
No.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.526
You're somewhere in between.

03:41.796 --> 03:43.596
Your future depends
on the outcome

03:43.664 --> 03:45.831
of that settlement
meeting tomorrow.

03:45.899 --> 03:48.133
If Jenna gets her job back,

03:48.201 --> 03:51.270
well, you get to move on.

03:53.574 --> 03:56.275
So-so none of this
is really happening?

03:56.343 --> 03:58.544
Everything on the
island is real,

03:58.612 --> 04:00.846
but the rest is an illusion.

04:00.914 --> 04:02.648
- What island?
- Uh, forget that last bit.

04:02.715 --> 04:05.383
- Wilfred!
- Shh! Smoke monster!

04:05.451 --> 04:07.519
<i>I've seen Lost, Wilfred.</i>

04:07.586 --> 04:09.521
What did you think
of the ending?

04:09.589 --> 04:11.156
Why can't I get a straight
answer out of you?

04:11.224 --> 04:12.658
Come on, Ryan!

04:12.726 --> 04:14.994
These are big
existential questions.

04:15.061 --> 04:16.896
Best left for boring
Russian novelists

04:16.963 --> 04:18.930
and teenagers on acid.

04:18.999 --> 04:20.733
Real people don't
think about this shit!

04:20.802 --> 04:24.338
Just find a way
to save that girl.

04:24.406 --> 04:26.774
Then she'll be yours.

04:26.842 --> 04:30.978
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:31.045 --> 04:33.647
I am gonna summon up
my own smoke monster.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.968
And when your station's
traffic reporter,

04:57.035 --> 04:58.970
Inez Delgado, had
an on-air nip slip,

04:59.037 --> 05:01.272
all she got was a
slap on the wrist.

05:01.340 --> 05:05.209
And 600,000 hits
on YouTube. So what?

05:05.277 --> 05:06.611
He's alleging
reverse discrimination.

05:06.678 --> 05:08.547
Yup, trendy.

05:08.614 --> 05:12.151
If that's all you've got, then
I'll take my chances in court.

05:12.219 --> 05:13.953
Mr. St. Cloud, please.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.055
You know how much pressure
there is for on-air talent.

05:16.123 --> 05:17.457
You were a meteorologist.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.759
I was a weatherman, son.

05:19.827 --> 05:23.697
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
to go to a charity walk-a-thon

05:23.765 --> 05:25.632
and hug some clefties.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.402
Uh, I'm a little disappointed,
Newman.

05:29.469 --> 05:32.705
Some of the guys in my firm
actually warned me about you.

05:32.773 --> 05:35.741
Apparently, you used
to have quite the reputation.

05:35.809 --> 05:39.745
Called you the, um-- what
was it-- the Anthropologist

05:39.813 --> 05:42.214
- or some shit like that.
- The Archaeologist.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.349
Well, um, maybe
you'd have better luck

05:44.417 --> 05:45.918
in that line of work.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.760
Look,

05:54.827 --> 05:58.830
you know a local TV
personality like Mr. St. Cloud

05:58.897 --> 06:01.032
has a full schedule of
public appearances...

06:01.100 --> 06:05.337
But for his own good,
I think he should reconsider.

06:05.405 --> 06:07.306
Please.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.948
Full reinstatement.

06:19.255 --> 06:20.889
Oh. Thank you.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.695
I don't even want to know
how you got those documents.

06:26.763 --> 06:29.732
No, you do not.

06:32.703 --> 06:34.971
You said you'd deliver
Jenna if I won.

06:35.039 --> 06:37.941
You took that seriously?

06:38.009 --> 06:40.611
Dude, Jenna's not
a meat-lover's pizza

06:40.679 --> 06:43.281
I can have delivered
in 30 minutes or less.

06:43.348 --> 06:44.715
Hey, you know what
sounds good right now?

06:44.783 --> 06:46.618
Chinese.

06:46.685 --> 06:48.953
- So you lied?
- I did not lie.

06:49.021 --> 06:51.156
I Wilfred-lied.

06:51.223 --> 06:52.290
You manipulated me.

06:52.358 --> 06:57.228
No. I Wilfred-manipulated you.

06:57.296 --> 06:59.164
Hey, don't be mad, mate.

06:59.231 --> 07:00.732
Why would I be mad?

07:00.800 --> 07:02.300
You taught me a
valuable lesson today.

07:02.368 --> 07:03.868
If I really want something,

07:03.936 --> 07:05.637
I have to do whatever it takes.

07:05.705 --> 07:07.005
And I want Jenna.

07:07.073 --> 07:09.308
Ryan, I think

07:09.376 --> 07:11.944
you might be slipping down
that slope we talked about.

07:14.548 --> 07:16.516
I don't need your help.

07:16.584 --> 07:18.385
Just stay out of my way.

07:19.854 --> 07:21.654
Ryan. Wait.

07:21.722 --> 07:23.589
I was wrong.

07:23.657 --> 07:25.725
I do want pizza! Ryan!

07:31.513 --> 07:34.081
Brought a little champagne
for the victory brunch, bro.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.483
I can't thank you enough.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.951
Oh, you officially just did.

07:37.019 --> 07:38.787
No more thank yous,
please. Come on in.

07:38.854 --> 07:40.956
Hors d'oeuvres on the porch.

07:42.325 --> 07:43.692
Uh, rude.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.461
- You weren't invited.
- Yeah.

07:45.529 --> 07:47.062
I'm sure that was
just an oversight.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.897
It wasn't.

07:48.965 --> 07:52.233
Look, I know we ended things
on a sour note yesterday, and

07:52.301 --> 07:53.801
we never did get that pizza.

07:53.869 --> 07:56.003
But I was just trying
to make a point.

07:56.071 --> 07:58.538
All that underhanded
Machiavellian shit--

07:58.606 --> 08:00.640
that's just not you.

08:00.707 --> 08:02.708
That's not what you were saying
at the settlement meeting.

08:02.776 --> 08:04.477
That was a one-time thing.

08:04.544 --> 08:06.646
You don't want to win
Jenna's heart that way.

08:06.713 --> 08:09.749
Hey, what the hell
are they doing here?

08:09.817 --> 08:11.585
Well, it's my celebration.

08:11.652 --> 08:13.353
Why wouldn't I
invite my family?

08:13.421 --> 08:15.289
Hang on.

08:15.356 --> 08:17.157
You smell funny.

08:17.224 --> 08:19.593
You smell like... conniving.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.796
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:22.864 --> 08:25.532
Mr. Patel, I'm so glad
you could make it.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.501
Now the party can begin.

08:27.569 --> 08:29.103
Just show me to the booze,

08:29.171 --> 08:31.405
crackerjack.

08:34.409 --> 08:36.544
I'm just so happy to share
this special day with you,

08:36.611 --> 08:41.317
and Drew and your family
and... Mr. Patel.

08:41.385 --> 08:42.986
To Ryan.

08:43.053 --> 08:44.587
Ryan.

08:44.655 --> 08:45.955
Who's Ryan?

08:46.023 --> 08:47.090
I don't know what

08:47.157 --> 08:48.758
you're up to, Ryan,

08:48.826 --> 08:50.593
but I've got my nose
and ears on you.

08:50.661 --> 08:52.261
And my eyes, too, I guess,

08:52.329 --> 08:54.964
but frankly, my vision's
pretty shitty.

08:55.032 --> 08:56.633
Hey, I just want to say,
I'm really proud of you.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.134
I always knew you were

08:58.202 --> 08:59.435
an amazing lawyer,
but you really...

08:59.503 --> 09:01.705
Kristen, did I introduce you

09:01.772 --> 09:02.973
- to my neighbor yet?
- Um, yeah.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.374
Like, three times.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.809
Mr. Patel was

09:05.877 --> 09:08.077
a nuclear engineer in, uh...

09:08.145 --> 09:09.145
India.

09:09.213 --> 09:10.981
Really?

09:11.048 --> 09:13.249
You know, my wife's thinking
about traveling to India.

09:13.317 --> 09:15.018
She wants to deliver
babies with Arturo.

09:15.086 --> 09:16.886
Sorry. Dr. Ramos.

09:16.954 --> 09:18.622
- Leo.
- God, that's right.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.290
I didn't even think about that.

09:20.358 --> 09:21.658
You know, I'd be
curious to find out

09:21.726 --> 09:22.959
what Mr. Patel thinks
of his homeland.

09:23.027 --> 09:25.262
Would you describe it as clean?

09:25.330 --> 09:26.697
Allow me to answer your
question with a question.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.832
Do you like garbage everywhere?

09:28.900 --> 09:29.867
Yes.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.334
You like puddles of

09:31.402 --> 09:32.635
diarrhea in the street?

09:32.703 --> 09:33.837
Uh, duh.

09:33.904 --> 09:35.606
Do you like seeing

09:35.673 --> 09:38.275
dead, decaying animals
wherever you go?

09:38.342 --> 09:40.310
Holy shit! Is this
India place real?

09:40.378 --> 09:42.312
You're an asshole, Leo.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.880
Let me get us some more wine.

09:46.884 --> 09:48.385
Very clever, Ryan.

09:48.452 --> 09:50.086
Figured out my plan, did you?

09:50.154 --> 09:52.288
No. But if you think

09:52.356 --> 09:54.490
I'm just gonna stand
by and watch you...

09:54.558 --> 09:56.625
Bubbles! One, two,

09:56.693 --> 10:00.695
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...

10:00.763 --> 10:04.298
I owe my career to you,

10:04.366 --> 10:06.834
but I still don't understand
why I freaked out.

10:06.902 --> 10:08.636
Are you okay?

10:08.704 --> 10:11.038
Yeah.

10:11.105 --> 10:14.975
I just don't get how
two people end up like this.

10:15.043 --> 10:17.311
I mean, when they got
engaged, they were so in love.

10:17.379 --> 10:21.248
Guess you just never know.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.319
Sorry. I didn't
mean to burden you.

10:24.386 --> 10:25.553
No, not at all.

10:25.621 --> 10:28.023
It's just... sad.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.895
37... 38,

10:32.963 --> 10:34.764
39, 40!

10:34.832 --> 10:36.065
Whoo-hoo!

10:36.133 --> 10:37.801
All right, as I was saying,

10:37.868 --> 10:39.336
you can't treat these
people like bloody pieces

10:39.403 --> 10:41.404
in some twisted game of chess.

10:41.472 --> 10:42.606
Don't even think about it.

10:42.674 --> 10:43.607
Ryan, I swear to God,
if you blow

10:43.675 --> 10:45.208
one more... bubbles, whoo-hoo!

10:45.276 --> 10:47.443
One, two, three, four,

10:47.511 --> 10:49.445
five, six, seven, en
eight, nine, ten.

10:51.549 --> 10:53.083
Just leave them in the sink.

10:53.150 --> 10:56.619
Hey, now you're talking.

10:58.822 --> 11:03.291
Hmm, by the way,
congratulations.

11:03.359 --> 11:05.594
Duh.

11:05.661 --> 11:07.296
You're getting married, bro.

11:07.364 --> 11:10.199
Yeah, well,

11:10.267 --> 11:13.002
she hasn't exactly
said yes yet.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.605
I'm still giving her some
time to think about it.

11:15.673 --> 11:16.873
Oh.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.345
That's rough, with...

11:21.413 --> 11:24.015
- What?
- The noon news.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.750
I mean, Jenna's going
to be a celebrity.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.119
I mean, if I were
you, I would do

11:28.186 --> 11:29.586
everything I could
to seal the deal

11:29.654 --> 11:32.456
before the cameras
start rolling again,

11:32.523 --> 11:34.992
but that's just me.

11:49.439 --> 11:51.273
Looking for this?

11:54.245 --> 11:55.645
So you're using

11:55.713 --> 11:57.347
Mr. Patel to drive a wedge

11:57.415 --> 11:59.316
between your sister
and her husband

11:59.384 --> 12:02.586
so you can dangle their failed
marriage before Jenna's eyes.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.722
It's an evil game
you're playing.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.891
Don't get me wrong--
it's brilliant,

12:06.958 --> 12:08.492
but you're on that
slippery slope,

12:08.560 --> 12:10.794
Ryan, and any minute...

12:10.862 --> 12:11.996
Bubbles!

12:12.063 --> 12:14.531
Goddamn you, Ryan.

12:19.837 --> 12:21.037
Are you gonna move out here?

12:21.104 --> 12:22.672
Do you expect me
to move back to Wisconsin?

12:22.739 --> 12:24.907
We can figure all
of that out later,

12:24.975 --> 12:27.609
but I can't keep waiting
around like this.

12:27.677 --> 12:30.679
Jenna, you need to tell
me now-- yes or no.

12:30.747 --> 12:32.648
Now.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.349
Okay, no.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.551
Ooh,

12:35.618 --> 12:36.652
ouch.

12:39.823 --> 12:41.023
Dodging a bullet there, pal.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.825
Ugh, you're disgusting.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.560
I'm waiting in the car.

12:44.627 --> 12:45.761
No, I'm waiting in the car.

12:45.828 --> 12:47.997
The e-vite said 1:00 to 5:00.

12:48.064 --> 12:49.197
I've got two more hours.

12:49.265 --> 12:51.633
I am not leaving.

12:57.006 --> 12:59.007
Hope you're proud
of yourself, Ryan.

12:59.075 --> 13:01.343
I'm gonna be up all night
licking Jenna's tears.

13:01.411 --> 13:02.911
Know what all that
sodium's going to do

13:02.979 --> 13:04.446
to my blood pressure?

13:04.514 --> 13:05.814
This is nothing
compared to some

13:05.882 --> 13:07.149
of the shit you've pulled.

13:07.216 --> 13:08.683
Yeah, but you' not me.

13:08.751 --> 13:11.187
You're a good person,
and you're a person.

13:11.255 --> 13:13.790
You're turning into a guy
I don't even recognize.

13:13.857 --> 13:16.593
Christ, you take all
the fun out of bubbles.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.733
All you have to do is
sign the settlement,

13:23.801 --> 13:25.301
and it's back
to the anchor desk.

13:27.004 --> 13:29.472
I know things
have been difficult,

13:29.540 --> 13:32.776
but I just want you
to know I'm here for you.

13:32.843 --> 13:36.145
You always are, aren't you?

13:36.213 --> 13:38.681
Hey, what do you say
we go to dinner?

13:38.749 --> 13:41.016
We don't have to talk
about work or Drew.

13:41.084 --> 13:44.386
It'll just be the two of us
having a good time.

13:44.454 --> 13:47.022
I'd love that.

13:54.565 --> 13:57.267
Wait, we never
discussed a drug test.

13:57.335 --> 13:58.469
Insurance company requires it.

13:58.536 --> 14:00.337
You got a problem with that?

14:00.405 --> 14:02.306
I've never taken
a drug in my life.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.079
Wilfred!

14:17.621 --> 14:20.323
Don't mind me, I'm just
finishing up my will,

14:20.391 --> 14:22.225
then I'm gone.

14:22.292 --> 14:25.561
Now you'll know what to do
if anything happens to me.

14:25.628 --> 14:28.063
- Good-bye, Ryan.
- Jenna's in trouble.

14:28.131 --> 14:29.231
- What's happened?
- The station's sending over

14:29.298 --> 14:30.532
an insurance rep
tomorrow to give her

14:30.534 --> 14:32.034
a drug test, which means...

14:32.101 --> 14:34.169
We have to disembowel
the insurance rep.

14:34.237 --> 14:36.405
What? No, w-we need clean pee.

14:36.473 --> 14:38.641
You didn't let me finish, Ryan.

14:38.709 --> 14:42.378
We need to disembowel the
insurance representative.

14:46.921 --> 14:48.422
I'm sorry about yesterday.

14:48.490 --> 14:51.090
Leo and I are going through
a, uh, pretty rough patch.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.126
Oh, don't swear it.
More coffee?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.594
No, I'm good.

14:54.662 --> 14:57.931
Anyway, um, I've decided
not to go to India.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.266
Well, I'm sure
that's for the best.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.900
I think so, too.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.736
I have to stay here so we can
work things out, you know.

15:03.804 --> 15:06.238
I really do love him,
it's just, um...

15:06.306 --> 15:09.775
Uh, Arturo and
I had an affair.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.844
It was months ago.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.480
- It was just, just one time.
- Does Leo know?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.949
No, it would kill him.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.951
Ryan, Ryan!

15:20.019 --> 15:21.319
Ryan!

15:21.387 --> 15:23.722
Uh...

15:23.789 --> 15:25.657
Finish your coffee.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.927
The insurance rep
arrived early.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.464
Do you have Kristen's piss?

15:31.532 --> 15:33.833
I haven't been able to ask
her yet. You need to stall.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.535
As we speak, Jenna
is squeezing out

15:35.603 --> 15:37.905
the last golden droplets of
her once promising career.

15:37.972 --> 15:40.207
Okay, don't let that rep leave
until I can make the switch.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.475
You think you can handle that?

15:44.045 --> 15:46.780
God, it's such a relief to
tell someone about Arturo.

15:46.848 --> 15:48.315
- You're the only person...
- I need urine.

15:48.383 --> 15:51.350
- What? - I need you
to pee in this cup now.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.287
Uh, that's not how I expected
this conversation to go.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.289
I've got a client
facing a drug test,

15:56.357 --> 15:57.557
and she's not going to pass

15:57.624 --> 15:58.791
if I don't get her
some clean pee.

15:58.859 --> 16:00.893
What, you're serious?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.861
Ryan, this is the
same kind of thing

16:02.929 --> 16:04.897
- that nearly got you disbarred.
- I know,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.532
- but it's just this once.
- It's fraud,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.467
Ryan, I won't do it.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.870
If you don't, I'll tell Leo
about you and Dr. Ramos.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.272
Who are you?

16:14.340 --> 16:17.809
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.745
Call Leo.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.117
Please.

16:26.184 --> 16:27.284
Hello.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.425
Four years of college, and
now you're a piss collector?

16:34.493 --> 16:36.227
- I bet your parents are real proud.
- Wilfred!

16:36.295 --> 16:38.129
God, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's gotten into him.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.331
Wilfred, come.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.933
I'm gonna lose Jenna,
and it's all your fault.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.568
What the hell good are you?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.503
You're the one who told me
to do whatever it takes.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.605
Well, damn it, do
whatever it takes now.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.740
You're right.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.177
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.517
Wilfred!

16:59.585 --> 17:00.885
Wilfred!

17:00.953 --> 17:03.154
Wilfred!

17:03.222 --> 17:04.622
Wilfred.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.491
Uh, I'm gonna go get my keys.

17:09.027 --> 17:10.961
It worked.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.029
You can get up now.

17:14.065 --> 17:15.933
Wilfred?

17:17.402 --> 17:19.237
Wilfred!

17:27.946 --> 17:30.982
So, still no word
from the doctor.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.750
That was the insurance rep.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.353
She said I passed
the drug test.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.189
That's great.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.291
Congratulations.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.059
I guess we'll have
to wait to celebrate.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.295
She also said I'm pregnant.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.334
Oh, my God, look, Jenna...

17:48.402 --> 17:51.337
No, this is good news.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.272
I should call Drew.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.543
I guess I'm getting
married after all.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.877
Jenna, wait.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.616
Kristen, listen,
I-I have to...

18:03.684 --> 18:05.518
You've got nothing to
hold over my head anymore.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.922
I just told Leo about my
affair, and he left me,

18:08.989 --> 18:12.492
so I am going to India,
and by the way,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.761
you're dead to me.

18:17.098 --> 18:18.231
Good news.

18:18.299 --> 18:19.966
He's going to be okay.

18:27.308 --> 18:29.143
How you doing, buddy?

18:32.648 --> 18:36.585
I don't know if you
can hear me, but...

18:36.653 --> 18:38.520
I've ruined everything.

18:41.290 --> 18:44.559
You tried to warn me...

18:44.627 --> 18:46.494
and I wouldn't listen.

18:49.331 --> 18:51.165
I forgot who I was.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.442
I know why you're here now.

19:04.445 --> 19:08.782
To stop me from slipping
down that slope.

19:08.850 --> 19:13.655
Please, Wilfred, I need
you to pull me back up.

19:13.723 --> 19:15.891
I need your help.

19:29.939 --> 19:32.240
Who are you?

19:33.409 --> 19:35.876
Wilfred, it's me.

19:35.944 --> 19:38.345
Help.

19:38.413 --> 19:39.546
There's a stranger in my room!!

19:41.616 --> 19:43.484
- Nurse!
- Wilfred, I don't know what to do.

19:43.551 --> 19:45.386
- Nurse!
- Tell me what to do.

19:45.454 --> 19:46.721
- I don't know you.
- You're upsetting the dog.

19:46.789 --> 19:47.922
- You need to leave.
- I don't know you!

19:47.990 --> 19:48.990
- Tell me what to do.
- Get out!

19:51.027 --> 19:52.227
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19:52.295 --> 19:54.863
<i>I'm writing my will.</i>

19:54.931 --> 19:58.233
Now you'll know what to do
if anything happens to me.
