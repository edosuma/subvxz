-Hey, guys--
-We know--
don't touch the cookies.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.670
Yeah, no need to make
a "hands off" sign

00:10.670 --> 00:12.210
with a picture of you
holding a bloody axe.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.290
No, I was just writing,

00:14.290 --> 00:16.120
"Help yourself."

00:23.420 --> 00:24.790
I feel like this is a trick.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.790
I know.

00:26.790 --> 00:29.710
Lately she's been generous,
and nice, and smiling.

00:29.710 --> 00:31.290
It's been really
creeping me out.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.170
I'm worried.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.420
Rachel hasn't been
her snarky self

00:42.420 --> 00:43.960
since she got back
from her trip to Paris.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.460
And she's been back
for two weeks.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.250
That vacation glow
should've been gone

00:47.250 --> 00:49.750
five minutes
into the ride home
from the airport.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.460
Thanks, Rachel!

00:56.420 --> 01:00.290
-Rachel just gave us
each a buck.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.170
She said just for being us.

01:03.290 --> 01:06.540
And she did this
to my hair.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.670
Something's wrong
with Rachel.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.790
Maybe Rachel didn't
come back from Paris.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.960
Maybe it's an alien
in a Rachel suit.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.170
That would be terrible.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.000
But also really cool!

01:19.830 --> 01:21.420
So I just need to--

01:29.290 --> 01:30.830
My French isn't great,

01:30.830 --> 01:32.420
but she said,
"I can't talk now."

01:32.420 --> 01:34.040
Rachel's taken
three years of French,

01:34.040 --> 01:35.920
and I've never
heard her utter one word.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.960
There's only one reason why
she's busting that out now.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.000
-A boy.
You're right.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.960
She must've met
someone in Paris.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.330
What was she doing
in the closet?

01:45.330 --> 01:46.580
Hmm.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.540
This suitcase is packed!

01:50.540 --> 01:51.540
Is she running away?

01:51.540 --> 01:52.920
No, that's crazy!

01:52.920 --> 01:55.330
We just overheard
Rachel on the phone.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.420
For a small fee
we'll tell you
what she said.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.790
'Cause it's not
like you're gonna

01:58.790 --> 02:00.250
give us a dollar
for just being us.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.830
Tell us, or for a small fee

02:01.830 --> 02:03.790
we won't crack your heads
together for just being you!

02:04.790 --> 02:06.210
Sorry, I'm just

02:06.210 --> 02:07.830
really freaked out
about this Rachel thing.

02:07.830 --> 02:09.290
She said to the other person

02:09.290 --> 02:11.290
if all went well,
she'd see them soon.

02:11.290 --> 02:14.290
Also, I don't think
she's an alien,

02:14.290 --> 02:16.330
because I spoke
to her in alien,

02:16.330 --> 02:18.250
and she just
looked at me weird.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.460
You know that feeling you get

02:20.460 --> 02:22.000

Rachel's running away?
She must really
like this boy.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.670
She never packs
this far in advance.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.500
What do we do?
What do we do?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.500
We wait until we have
all the information.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.170
We have to
play this cool.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.580
-No!

03:38.580 --> 03:40.920
Aah!
What are you doing?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.250
Stopping you from running away
to Paris with some random dude.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.670
Ugh! I'm not running away.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.460
Really? Then why
is your suitcase packed?

03:47.460 --> 03:50.120
Because I never unpacked it
from my last trip.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.290
I was getting it
to do laundry.

03:53.540 --> 03:56.380
Okay, maybe you're
still as lazy as ever,

03:56.380 --> 03:58.080
but we know something's up.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.380
Fine.

04:02.380 --> 04:05.420
When I was in Paris,
I heard about
this university

04:05.420 --> 04:07.170
where my favorite
fashion designer,

04:07.170 --> 04:10.420
Christian LaMond, is teaching
an internship this semester.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.420
I applied to the school
and got in.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.420
-Wow!
!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.250
It starts in two weeks!

04:14.250 --> 04:16.420
-Wow.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.250
I'm confused.
I got more excited,
and you got less.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.830
It's just we weren't
expecting you

04:20.830 --> 04:22.880
to leave for college
for six more months.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.670
Yeah, I had a whole list
of activities planned.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.290
Double Dutch tournament,

04:26.290 --> 04:28.250
all-night Ryan Reynolds
film festival,

04:28.250 --> 04:30.000
bicycle tour of all the local
seafood hotspots, and I--

04:30.000 --> 04:32.830
No offense, but you're
making me wanna leave sooner.

04:32.830 --> 04:34.880
I'm not spending
the next six months

04:34.880 --> 04:37.330
eating clam chowder
in bicycle pants.

04:37.330 --> 04:40.000
Come on!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.420
I need your help to sell
Mom and Dad on me leaving.

04:42.420 --> 04:45.420
But how can we convince them
when we don't want you to go?

04:45.420 --> 04:48.960
If you had a chance to do
some amazing inventor thing,

04:48.960 --> 04:50.830
I'd support it.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.420
I'd think it was
lame and boring,

04:52.420 --> 04:54.670
but I'd support it.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.000
Because if your
brothers and sisters

04:57.000 --> 05:00.080
don't support your dreams,
who will?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.620
Hang on, two weeks,
then "Adios, Rachel"?

05:06.620 --> 05:10.080
Yes, except it'll be
au revoir, Rachel.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.620
But I'll only be able to
do it with your support.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.250
Actually, I'm gonna
do it anyway,

05:14.250 --> 05:16.080
but it'll be
a lot smoother.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.790
Well, I am not on board.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.290
I'm not good
with change.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.880
When Dumpster Jack
got food poisoning

05:20.880 --> 05:22.330
and they replaced him
with Dumpster Al,

05:22.330 --> 05:24.250
couldn't even
get out of bed.

05:26.290 --> 05:29.120
If you try to leave,
you will get it.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.540
And be warned,
these are not
soft bristles.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.420
I'm just gonna...

05:36.420 --> 05:39.290
They're not gonna
help my case
with Mom and Dad.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.120
Which closet
should we lock them in?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.620
Better idea.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.540
I've got a coupon
for free frozen yogurt.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.080
Ethan will take you to the mall.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.330
Yeah!
-No way!

05:48.330 --> 05:50.330
I wanna see Mom
and Dad's reaction.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.830
I've got five bucks
on Mom crying

05:52.830 --> 05:54.420
Hm.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.750
The blackmail book.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.960
For years now,
Rachel's been keeping a list

05:59.960 --> 06:03.120
of every bad thing us Diaz kids
have ever done.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.960
Not because she likes
to make lists.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.960
Because she can use it
to her advantage.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.540
Fold this.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.960
What? No, that's your job.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.500
Okay, then I'll tell Mom and Dad

06:15.500 --> 06:16.830
what you did last week.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.210
You know about that?

06:18.210 --> 06:21.580
Yep, and it's all in here.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.710
I might miss you,
but I'm not gonna
miss that book.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.920
And if you think
I'm visiting you in Paris,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.830
away from Mom and Dad,

06:29.830 --> 06:32.330
surrounded by cute
French girls--

06:32.330 --> 06:34.420
Anyone need anything
at the mall?

06:37.330 --> 06:40.460
Guys, we're supposed
to be getting froyo,

06:40.460 --> 06:42.330
not messing with a bunch
of lipsticks.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.460
It says "tester."

06:44.460 --> 06:46.420
That's what we're doing.

06:46.420 --> 06:48.580
I thought you guys said
you wanted to get Rachel

06:48.580 --> 06:50.380
a going-away gift.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.290
You guys look like
you flunked out
of clown college.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.290
Loser clown.
That's what I was going for.

06:57.170 --> 06:59.170
Hey, guys.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.960
Sniff this body spray.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.500
Smells like that one time
Rachel yelled at us

07:06.500 --> 07:08.210
for sitting too close to her.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.620
It does.

07:09.620 --> 07:12.790
I'm gonna miss her so much.

07:12.790 --> 07:15.080
This is the lipstick
she used to write

07:15.080 --> 07:17.670
"Don't touch my stuff"
on her mirror.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.710
All right, guys,

07:19.710 --> 07:21.330
ready to move on
to hair care.

07:21.330 --> 07:23.250
Mm. Be strong.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.250
I'll be over there.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.710
You're gonna wanna
get that BB cream.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.670
My sister swears by it.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.620
But you'll need
the right contour blender

07:38.620 --> 07:40.620
to go with that.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.790
This primer is
two dollars more,

07:42.790 --> 07:44.670
but it'll extend
your concealer

07:44.670 --> 07:47.120
for at least a month.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.880
You're never gonna
achieve that look

07:48.880 --> 07:50.250
without the proper brush.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.670
I wouldn't get that one.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.420
They say it's
non-comedogenic...

07:53.420 --> 07:55.040
It's not.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.500
I wouldn't have pegged you
as a makeup expert.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.380
What's your secret?

08:06.380 --> 08:09.120
Three sisters
and a long car ride to school.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.210
I'm Jayden, the manager.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.710
How would you like to work at
Me, Myself, and Eyeshadow?

08:13.710 --> 08:17.500
Me at a makeup store?
I don't know.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.710
It is a nice clientele.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.920
Everything in this store
reminds us of Rachel!

08:25.920 --> 08:28.500
We never wanna
come back here again!

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
I'll take it.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.120
You can't put it off
any longer.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.170
Time to tell
Mom and Dad.

08:36.170 --> 08:37.750
Remember, you have
the full support

08:37.750 --> 08:40.210
of everyone in the family
who doesn't have baby teeth.

08:40.210 --> 08:41.290
What if they say no?

08:41.290 --> 08:42.960
They won't say no.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.330
Mom and Dad
are always supportive

08:44.330 --> 08:45.920
of their kids
following their dreams.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.120
Look at Georgie.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.330
They pay for all
those team uniforms,

08:49.330 --> 08:50.330
and all that equipment,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.290
and she never even plays.

08:52.290 --> 08:53.880
But they still let her.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.290
And look at the inventions
Harley builds.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.330
A lot of them
end up exploding

08:58.330 --> 09:00.380
and causing damage,
but they still let her.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.750
You know what,
stay focused on Rachel.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.670
But remember to fight
about this later.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.380
-Hmm.
-You want us
to come with you?

09:05.380 --> 09:08.380
No, it's hard to prove
I'm independent

09:08.380 --> 09:10.080
with my two sisters
standing behind me

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
-like my backup singers.
Mm.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.330
Huh. So, let me
get this straight.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.420
Instead of going to college
six months from now,

09:17.420 --> 09:20.960
you feel you're ready to
move to Paris in 11 days.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.620
Ugh, I can't really hear
anything through this.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.420
But I guess
we're just lucky

09:27.420 --> 09:29.250
it's not exploding
or causing damage.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.330
I thought we were having
that fight later.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.080
-Laughter!

09:34.080 --> 09:35.670
They're celebrating.
She did it!

09:35.670 --> 09:38.540
Yes!

09:39.880 --> 09:42.380
There's no way
that's happening.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.830
I'm sorry!

09:43.830 --> 09:45.620
We held it together
as long as we could.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.960
-We did.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.330
I can't believe
you're saying no to college.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.670
Oh, no, no, we're not
saying no to college.

09:54.670 --> 09:57.330
We're saying no to college
overseas in 11 days.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.000
Guys, this is
a paid internship

10:00.000 --> 10:01.250
with Christian LaMond.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.790
I promise, I'll do anything.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.460
You promise us
all kinds of things,

10:05.460 --> 10:07.380
and you never come through.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.920
"Buy me a new phone
and I'll take pictures
for the family album."

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
"Let me use the car, and I'll
clean out Daphne's playhouse."

10:11.920 --> 10:13.420
"Let me stay at Zia's,
and I'll make sure

10:13.420 --> 10:15.170
Lewie and Beast
brush their teeth."

10:15.170 --> 10:17.540
Ooh, and don't forget we have
a broken swing set out back

10:17.540 --> 10:20.080
because we let you
go to a party
instead of babysit.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.620
You haven't kept
a single promise.

10:21.620 --> 10:22.960
A responsible person

10:22.960 --> 10:25.210
makes promises,
and keeps them.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.250
Let me go to Paris,
and I swear

10:27.250 --> 10:29.210
-it'll be different.
-Sorry, Rach.

10:29.210 --> 10:32.210
Start showing us you can be
responsible and mature,

10:32.210 --> 10:34.420
and maybe
we'll let you go
in the fall.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.580
But I won't have
an internship in the fall.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.790
And I'm mature enough now!

10:40.040 --> 10:42.330
Besides what I did there.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.120
Congratulations!

10:48.670 --> 10:51.420
For what? They said no.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.620
But we heard them laughing.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.380
At me, not with me.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.460
They said I'm not responsible.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.960
They had a whole list
of promises I didn't keep.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.620
They make it seem like I never
do anything I say I will.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.040
In their defense,
you are wearing

11:07.040 --> 11:08.750
the shirt you told Mom
you'd never borrow again.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.750
It's over!

11:10.750 --> 11:12.960
And I already
wasted all that time

11:12.960 --> 11:15.330
mentally picking out
my outfits for the first week.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.120
It's not over.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.040
You just have to
prove to them
you can change.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.330
They made a list,

11:23.330 --> 11:25.330
-you make one, too.

11:25.330 --> 11:27.460
Make a list of everything
you promised Mom and Dad,

11:27.460 --> 11:30.380
and here's a twist:
you actually finish it.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.330
They will not see that coming.

11:32.330 --> 11:33.750
Yes!

11:33.750 --> 11:35.330
This could be
like my apology tour.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.500
And everyone loves
an apology tour.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.880
Great. How many things
did you promise them you'd do?

11:39.880 --> 11:43.460
A ton.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.080
When you really don't
plan on doing them,

11:45.080 --> 11:47.080
you promise anything.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.290
Guys, I love this idea,

11:49.290 --> 11:51.290
but it would take months.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.330
Good thing you've got
six siblings to help.

12:02.830 --> 12:04.210
Look at you!

12:04.210 --> 12:06.330
You are a
makeup-selling machine!

12:06.330 --> 12:08.210
Well, I don't know
about machine.

12:08.210 --> 12:10.580
Most machines don't have
hair this good.

12:10.580 --> 12:13.620
Hi. Do you guys
do makeovers?

12:13.620 --> 12:15.040
Uh, yeah.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.620
Gwen usually
takes care of those,

12:16.620 --> 12:20.080
but Ethan's free.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.290
Yeah. You said
you did makeovers
when I hired you, right?

12:24.120 --> 12:27.420
Yes, that is something I said.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.540
Okay, makeover's done.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.540
Good luck at your
sister's wedding.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.120
What?! I look terrible!

12:36.120 --> 12:38.750
I, uh...

12:38.750 --> 12:41.120
Uh, I...

12:41.120 --> 12:44.620
But the problem was
I kept adding stuff

12:44.620 --> 12:46.710
trying to make you look

12:46.710 --> 12:49.000
better than you do naturally.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.580
Yeah, I should've known
that was impossible.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.790
Really?

12:55.830 --> 12:57.750
Thanks!

12:57.750 --> 13:00.790
Now, I don't wanna make
my manager jealous,

13:00.790 --> 13:04.330
so I better let you out
the fire exit.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.040
I need you guys' help

13:06.040 --> 13:07.580
so Mom and Dad
will let me go away.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.670
I'll be leaving
in six months anyway.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.210
And if you help me,
I'll give you something

13:14.210 --> 13:16.000
to dry your tears with.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.830
Mm-hmm.
The blackmail book.

13:21.830 --> 13:24.210
Ultimate power.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.790
Unless you want
one of the other kids
to have it.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.580
We're in.

13:28.580 --> 13:30.250
So, with our help,

13:30.250 --> 13:33.120
Rachel set out to make good
on her promises.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.080
Fix the swing set.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.330
Daphne made sure
the hammers worked.

13:37.330 --> 13:40.460
Teach Lewie and Beast
the art of flossing.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.710
Dare to clean
Daphne's playhouse.

13:44.710 --> 13:46.460
Ah!

13:46.460 --> 13:49.250
Show Ethan
how to do a makeover.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.330
This one was for
the love of the game.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.290
Sweep the driveway
and the gutters
at the same time--

13:54.290 --> 13:57.120
thanks to my clever invention.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.710
♪ Listen to this cover ♪

13:59.790 --> 14:01.790
Maybe a little too clever.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.960
In one messy day,

14:05.960 --> 14:10.290
we completed
ten years of promises.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.250
I'm never one to follow a plan,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.210
so I added a little
of my own jush--

14:14.210 --> 14:17.040
water cannons,
umbrellas for rainy days,

14:17.040 --> 14:20.540
snack ferrying system,
and best of all...

14:20.540 --> 14:22.290
the Diaz family flag.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.960
I don't believe it.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.380
You made good on every
single one of your promises.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.210
I even did some stuff
that wasn't on my list.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.000
Like teaching Ethan
how to do a makeover.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.380
I didn't want him
to lose his job--

14:47.380 --> 14:49.380
or his 20% employee discount.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.460
I didn't think
you had it in you

14:50.460 --> 14:51.790
to get all this
done so fast.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.960
I had some help.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.250
The fact you got
anyone to help

14:55.250 --> 14:56.670
is even more impressive.

14:56.670 --> 14:58.830
And double bonus points
for Daphne.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.710
We asked you to step up,
and you did.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.250
I hate to say it,
but she proved herself.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.250
I think we have to
let her go to Paris.

15:15.170 --> 15:18.000
You guys lived up to
your end of the bargain,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.750
so I'm living up to mine.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.250
Uh, this is blank.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.790
Yeah, it is.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.620
But none of the other kids
know that.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.960
That's why that book's
so powerful.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.710
Everyone does bad stuff,

15:38.710 --> 15:40.080
and I got them all convinced

15:40.080 --> 15:42.080
that whatever they do
is right in there.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.380
That is so cold.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.040
I can't believe I didn't
think of it myself.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.420
Just a little more blush...

15:52.420 --> 15:55.460
and...ta-da!

15:55.460 --> 15:57.000
Ugh!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.960
You look great.
Wh

16:00.540 --> 16:02.460
My friend came in here
the other day,

16:02.460 --> 16:04.330
and you told her that
she looked beautiful

16:04.330 --> 16:06.210
without any makeup,
but you put

16:06.210 --> 16:09.080
all this makeup on me.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.290
Y-You must think...

16:10.290 --> 16:13.620
Uh...

16:13.620 --> 16:15.210
the-the truth is,

16:15.210 --> 16:19.080
I kept putting makeup
on you because...

16:19.080 --> 16:23.540
I was trying to work up
the nerve to ask you out.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.670
Everything okay over here?

16:24.670 --> 16:26.670
Totally!

16:26.670 --> 16:28.460
We're dating now.

16:34.170 --> 16:35.250
What do you think
it's gonna be like

16:35.250 --> 16:36.670
without Rachel
in the house?

16:36.670 --> 16:38.250
We're gonna miss her.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.750
And based on this suitcase,
so will the mall.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.420
You can stop packing.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.670
Why?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.250
I just heard
from the school.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.830
I took too long to enroll.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.620
They gave away my slot.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.880
I'm not going.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.120
I don't understand.
How can this happen?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.250
The school
changed the deadline
to enroll,

16:58.250 --> 16:59.620
and I didn't know.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.420
They said there's
nothing they can do.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.620
I'm sad. But I'm also
kind of happy.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.420
In a way,
this all worked out--

17:09.420 --> 17:11.580
we get to support Rachel,
and now we get to keep her.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.580
But that school
jerked Rachel around.

17:13.580 --> 17:16.120
She worked hard.
She deserves to go.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.540
You're right.
Now I'm mad!

17:18.540 --> 17:20.620
Great, because we're gonna
call that school right now

17:20.620 --> 17:22.500
and tell 'em
they have to accept her.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.920
You bet we are.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.380
Quick, let's do it before
my feelings change again.

17:26.380 --> 17:30.290
No one tells my sister
she can't go to--

17:30.290 --> 17:32.620
Yeah, not sure how to say
the name of the school,

17:32.620 --> 17:35.170
but no one tells her
she's not going there.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.620
You took French,
so I'll do the talking,

17:37.620 --> 17:39.120
you do the translating.

17:41.710 --> 17:43.330
Bonjour.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.210
Tell her it's the family
of Rachel Diaz.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.460
We demand to know
why you change your
deadline to enroll,

17:47.460 --> 17:48.580
and not tell people.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.420
It's totally unfair
that they won't admit her

17:50.420 --> 17:52.210
because of
a stupid technicality!

17:52.210 --> 17:53.580
What do you have
to say for yourself?!

17:53.580 --> 17:55.420
We want answers!

17:55.420 --> 18:00.120
C'est...la famille...

18:00.120 --> 18:02.290
des Rachel Diaz.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.830
Nous exi--exi--ous...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.330
Oh! My goodness!

18:09.330 --> 18:11.000
She said
she speaks English.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.420
And that my French
is not very good.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.710
Hello?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.210
Oh, you

18:18.210 --> 18:22.580
Well, I'm sorry for yelling,
but my sister is very upset.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.500
Yes, Rachel Diaz.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.040
What? But I thought--

18:30.540 --> 18:32.880
Oh. I see.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.040
-Thank you.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.290
The school didn't
give Rachel's spot away.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.500
She pulled her application.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.420
We know how down
you must be,

18:45.420 --> 18:48.210
so we brought you something
to help you feel better.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.790
-Thanks.
-Wait.

18:49.790 --> 18:52.460
Exactly why did the school
change the deadline?

18:52.460 --> 18:53.460
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

18:53.460 --> 18:54.880
They didn't say.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.120
And I was too devastated to ask.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.080
Funny, because
you don't seem
that upset now.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.790
Why is that?

19:03.790 --> 19:07.120
That's how the new, mature
Rachel handles thing.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.790
Now give me the ice cream.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.710
How dare you lie to us
with a delicious mouthful
of ice cream?

19:12.710 --> 19:15.290
We called the school
and found out

19:15.290 --> 19:16.790
you withdrew your application.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.380
Why would you do that?

19:18.380 --> 19:20.290
And after everything
we did to help you?

19:20.290 --> 19:23.330
I--I just feel like
maybe it's not the right time.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.960
I am kind of
leaving Mom and Dad
in the lurch,

19:27.960 --> 19:31.960
and...you idiots would never
be able to survive without me.

19:33.290 --> 19:36.460
And...you know,

19:36.460 --> 19:38.540
I...

19:38.540 --> 19:41.670
might not be ready
to leave the family yet.

19:41.670 --> 19:44.120
Can you repeat that?
Without chocolate chips.

19:45.670 --> 19:49.170
Look, when we were
doing all the stuff on my list,

19:49.170 --> 19:51.210
it was really fun.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.000
I'll miss everybody.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.920
Huh. All Rachel's brave talk

19:59.920 --> 20:02.330
about wanting
to leave the nest..

20:03.880 --> 20:06.290
turns out she's afraid to fly

20:11.920 --> 20:14.500
This is am amazing opportunity.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.080
It's your dream internship.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.880
You can't pass this up.

20:18.880 --> 20:24.210
And yes, you'll miss the family
whenever you leave to college.

20:24.210 --> 20:27.330
But you'll never
really lose us.

you spent an hour

20:32.290 --> 20:34.380

every day...

once a week.

that dumb thing

20:57.000 --> 20:59.670
where she pinches her ear
so she doesn't cry.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.540
