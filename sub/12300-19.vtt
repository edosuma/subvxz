WEBVTT

00:40.231 --> 00:41.274
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:45.361 --> 00:47.947
Excuse me.
Ma'am?

00:54.662 --> 00:56.330
So nobody noticed anything?

00:56.330 --> 00:58.958
She turned and burned like
everyone else around here.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.335
Last person waited on
her around 2:30.

01:01.335 --> 01:04.004
Hotel policy, never
wake a guest poolside.

01:04.004 --> 01:05.757
Okay, so where are
the attendants now?

01:05.757 --> 01:07.884
The entire shift's
waiting inside.

01:08.009 --> 01:09.093
All righty.

01:10.887 --> 01:12.555
Looks like a dried roast.

01:17.185 --> 01:19.937
We got a bullet wound to
the back of the head here.

01:21.689 --> 01:22.774
Sniper?

01:22.774 --> 01:24.817
No, I think I see a
stellate wound,

01:24.817 --> 01:26.652
so that makes it
close range.

01:26.652 --> 01:27.862
Publicly.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.530
Who would risk a
murder like this...

01:29.530 --> 01:31.657
in front of all these people
in broad daylight?

01:31.657 --> 01:33.701
Someone who wanted
to make it public.

01:33.701 --> 01:34.994
Guy's got to be crazy.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.662
Not that crazy.

01:36.871 --> 01:38.206
He got our attention.

02:15.618 --> 02:18.746
1x19 Double Cap

02:32.050 --> 02:34.135
Well, she traveled light.

02:34.135 --> 02:35.637
But well.

02:35.637 --> 02:38.723
Three hundred dollar
Helen Kaminski tote bag.

02:39.015 --> 02:41.184
Ooh, and look at her ring.

02:42.852 --> 02:44.479
Yes, an emerald.

02:44.479 --> 02:46.606
Cleopatra's favorite gem.

02:46.606 --> 02:48.483
Oval cut, too.

02:48.691 --> 02:50.526
Shark's choking on everything.

02:50.526 --> 02:52.528
The grid search offered up
six sprinkler heads,

02:52.528 --> 02:54.405
a bottle cap,
and a spoon.

02:54.405 --> 02:56.241
Bottom line,
no casings.

02:56.241 --> 02:58.284
So either the shooter
used a revolver...

02:58.284 --> 03:00.995
or they were smart enough
to pick up the cartridge.

03:01.829 --> 03:04.123
Alexx, can you
characterize the wound?

03:04.123 --> 03:05.667
Definite searing.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.001
Barrel to skin?

03:07.001 --> 03:08.628
This may have been
an execution.

03:08.628 --> 03:10.797
Or a very good imitation.

03:10.797 --> 03:12.465
It seems real to me.

03:12.465 --> 03:14.384
It's the victim that's wrong.

03:15.343 --> 03:17.095
You mean female?

03:18.137 --> 03:20.515
See you back at the post,
ladies. Nice going.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.643
Caine?

03:24.686 --> 03:28.106
Front desk says the victim's
name is Gloria Tynan.

03:28.648 --> 03:30.066
She regular or strange?

03:30.066 --> 03:33.486
She checks into the penthouse
suite every Tuesday with a guy.

03:33.486 --> 03:34.821
Nobody knows his name.

03:35.238 --> 03:36.739
Okay, so let's keep
the cleaning crew out ...

03:36.739 --> 03:38.074
of there until my
guys get here.

03:38.074 --> 03:39.033
There's more.

03:39.033 --> 03:41.452
Her hotel bill's always
paid in cash.

03:41.452 --> 03:43.121
Paid for a penthouse in cash,

03:43.121 --> 03:45.498
and yet we only found
ten dollars in her purse.

03:45.498 --> 03:48.001
First she checked out,
then went to the pool.

03:48.001 --> 03:49.961
Front desk says it's
part of her routine.

03:49.961 --> 03:52.046
Wasn't routine today, was it?

03:56.134 --> 03:57.635
Hey, check it out.

03:59.012 --> 03:59.971
We on TV?

04:00.722 --> 04:01.973
No, it's Alexx.

04:03.016 --> 04:04.851
It's the crime scene.
We were just down there.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.688
That means that security might
have caught our shooter in the act.

04:09.022 --> 04:11.441
Yeah, I got to get my
hands on today's footage.

04:11.941 --> 04:13.651
Hey, there's no way
you're getting out ...

04:13.651 --> 04:15.153
of processing this
hotel room with me.

04:15.153 --> 04:16.154
Why would I try to do that?

04:16.154 --> 04:19.072
I love hotel rooms.
Body fluids everywhere.

04:19.072 --> 04:21.159
Good.
Glove up.

04:29.542 --> 04:32.837
Movies on command,
got a full bar.

04:33.671 --> 04:35.006
It's definitely the way to go.

04:35.924 --> 04:39.052
Something tells me the mini-bar
isn't the reason to come up here.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.846
Bed's made.

04:42.889 --> 04:44.974
Maybe they did it
on the spread.

05:25.098 --> 05:26.724
Hey, I got a partial here.

05:27.016 --> 05:28.851
Gonna be thousands
of those.

05:28.851 --> 05:31.437
Yeah, this one had a glaze.
Might be fresh.

05:33.106 --> 05:34.983
Got some porn here.

05:34.983 --> 05:36.109
Get out of here.

05:36.818 --> 05:39.571
A girl that hot?
Guy had to be a viagra case.

05:39.571 --> 05:42.115
So the suspect's
probably over forty.

05:42.115 --> 05:43.032
You know what,

05:43.032 --> 05:44.617
I'm going to go watch
those surveillance tapes.

05:44.617 --> 05:47.328
Don't digitize that
one by mistake.

05:50.415 --> 05:51.499
Okay, gentlemen,

05:51.499 --> 05:53.585
I'm going to need y'all
to show me your hands.

05:54.252 --> 05:56.254
I'll show you anything
you want.

05:56.254 --> 05:58.006
Well, aren't you
accommodating?

06:02.552 --> 06:03.678
What's this for?

06:04.512 --> 06:07.724
There was a woman who
was murdered on y'all's shift,

06:07.724 --> 06:09.058
poolside.

06:17.901 --> 06:19.110
Is this yours?

06:19.527 --> 06:20.445
Yeah.

06:21.529 --> 06:24.282
It's pretty.
It's delicate.

06:26.075 --> 06:27.535
You don't have a tan line.

06:27.744 --> 06:29.412
I only wear it at the
end of my shift.

06:30.747 --> 06:32.540
After you take it
off a victim?

06:34.417 --> 06:36.502
She has black crystal
earrings that match.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.760
Look, it was laying on
her towel, okay?

06:43.760 --> 06:44.802
I didn't touch her.

06:44.802 --> 06:46.888
You don't have to touch
somebody to shoot them.

06:48.139 --> 06:49.349
Possible intercourse.

06:49.349 --> 06:50.934
I collected samples.

06:50.934 --> 06:53.311
Okay. Let's look for DNA
from a potential suspect.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.021
And what about
the gunshot wound?

06:55.021 --> 06:57.357
Turns out it's two.

06:58.399 --> 06:59.817
Clustered.

07:01.903 --> 07:03.321
Pros tap twice.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.156
Up close and personal,
don't they?

07:05.156 --> 07:07.325
Then we are dealing with a pro.

07:07.408 --> 07:09.619
Shooter pressed the
barrel against her skull ...

07:12.038 --> 07:14.332
... jerks from the first
impact, fires again.

07:18.503 --> 07:19.587
Two bullets.

07:21.673 --> 07:22.966
Along with this.

07:25.885 --> 07:27.804
Rubbery consistency.

07:30.181 --> 07:31.808
Let me get this to trace.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.270
Anything steel or
metal, Alexx?

07:35.270 --> 07:36.646
Such as?

07:36.646 --> 07:39.107
Maybe like from
a suppressor.

07:39.107 --> 07:40.608
Suppressor
would explain ...

07:40.608 --> 07:42.443
why nobody at the pool
heard the big bang-bang ...

07:42.443 --> 07:43.945
but no, just lead.

07:43.945 --> 07:46.197
Okay, her ten card,
as soon as you can.

07:46.614 --> 07:48.283
If you tell me your theory.

07:48.283 --> 07:51.494
Okay, pretty girl, two taps
to the back of the head.

07:52.245 --> 07:53.913
Worlds collide.

08:18.688 --> 08:19.606
Hi.

08:19.606 --> 08:21.441
I have a suspect I'd
like you to visit.

08:21.441 --> 08:23.902
He swiped our lady's
wristwatch at the pool.

08:23.902 --> 08:25.028
Homicide has
him in holding.

08:25.028 --> 08:25.862
Okay.

08:25.862 --> 08:28.156
It looks like you may have a
minor-league thief on your hands.

08:28.156 --> 08:30.491
Really?
Yeah, pending evidence.

08:31.117 --> 08:32.869
Excuse me.
Duquesne.

08:34.953 --> 08:36.164
Yeah, okay.

08:36.164 --> 08:38.291
I'll be there as soon
as I can break away.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.835
Thank you.

08:41.919 --> 08:45.131
I need you to take a look at the
bullets we extracted from the victim.

08:46.382 --> 08:47.216
Sure thing.

08:47.216 --> 08:49.427
Particular attention
to the striations.

08:49.844 --> 08:51.721
Do you mind if I run a
quick errand before I do?

08:51.721 --> 08:52.722
No.

08:52.722 --> 08:54.390
Okay.
Thanks.

09:02.357 --> 09:04.817
How do you like that
Agramonte color surveillance?

09:05.235 --> 09:07.737
Not your average
liquor store security.

09:08.029 --> 09:10.448
$250,000 digital system.

09:10.949 --> 09:12.575
Just pulled it off DAT.

09:12.867 --> 09:15.370
Here's your victim,
Gloria Tynan.

09:24.087 --> 09:25.255
She's spending
a weekday ...

09:25.255 --> 09:27.131
lounging by the pool
at the Agramonte.

09:27.590 --> 09:28.591
What am I doing here?

09:28.591 --> 09:30.760
You're making a difference
in your community.

09:32.845 --> 09:35.139
That's the last visual
of her, from any angle.

09:35.682 --> 09:37.267
Okay, so the
cabana hides her.

09:37.267 --> 09:40.228
Next time we see her, she's
being carried out in a body bag.

09:40.228 --> 09:44.065
But you can tell she asks
the attendant for a phone.

09:50.446 --> 09:51.447
Which one is he?

09:54.367 --> 09:55.451
Hugo.

09:55.451 --> 09:57.120
Simpkins in trace said...

09:57.120 --> 09:59.831
that we didn't find any
GSR on any of the pool guys.

10:00.456 --> 10:02.083
Is that a cell phone
on the ground?

10:02.083 --> 10:03.710
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

10:05.587 --> 10:08.464
Why would she ask
for a hotel land line ...

10:08.464 --> 10:10.341
when she's got a
cell phone next to her?

10:10.425 --> 10:11.467
Battery dead?

10:11.467 --> 10:12.594
I don't think so.

10:13.636 --> 10:16.222
I'm going to get into it.
Study every pixel.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.184
Hey, Dana.

10:23.104 --> 10:24.147
Thank you.

10:29.319 --> 10:30.778
Hey, dad.

10:31.821 --> 10:33.197
Lambchop ...

10:33.197 --> 10:34.532
well, look at you.

10:34.657 --> 10:35.825
Here I am.

10:36.242 --> 10:37.076
Yeah.

10:37.076 --> 10:39.078
Were you singing songs
for the customers?

10:39.162 --> 10:39.996
Oh, well,

10:39.996 --> 10:42.498
nothing that they haven't
ardently requested of me.

10:42.874 --> 10:44.334
How about I give
you a ride home?

10:44.334 --> 10:45.668
I walked here.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.254
Well, I realize that, dad.

10:50.340 --> 10:52.342
How about you walk
me out to my car?

10:54.636 --> 10:55.470
Why, certainly.

10:56.512 --> 10:58.306
Okay.
Good night, all.

11:00.391 --> 11:04.270
A gentlemen may never
refuse the request of a lady.

11:05.188 --> 11:07.607
Let your old dad take
you out to dinner.

11:07.607 --> 11:09.317
We'll go to that restaurant
in coral gables ...

11:09.317 --> 11:11.527
that your mama's
always talking about.

11:11.527 --> 11:12.862
I can't, dad.
I'm working.

11:12.862 --> 11:14.113
Now?

11:14.113 --> 11:15.573
Yeah.
Get in the car.

11:15.573 --> 11:16.991
I've got to go back to CSI.

11:16.991 --> 11:17.784
You know,

11:17.784 --> 11:20.370
you are much too pretty
to work as hard as you do.

11:21.496 --> 11:25.333
I know you think you just paid
me a big old compliment, but ...

11:25.333 --> 11:27.293
But nothing.
You are.

11:27.710 --> 11:30.255
Beautiful since the
day you were born.

11:30.255 --> 11:31.422
Beautiful girl.

11:33.925 --> 11:35.802
Okay, come on.
I'll let you sit in the front.

11:38.846 --> 11:40.306
I miss you, Calleigh.

11:45.186 --> 11:46.854
I'm here right now, dad.

11:54.153 --> 11:55.697
Getting a hit off of
our victim's ten card?

11:55.697 --> 11:56.823
AFIS.

11:57.156 --> 11:58.241
I've got lots of partials.

11:58.241 --> 11:59.909
I'm still trying to make sense of them.
Look at this.

11:59.909 --> 12:03.496
Regal Harbor Boat Tours.
Place of employment.

12:03.621 --> 12:04.455
That's weird.

12:04.455 --> 12:06.583
I've never seen that on
a general file before.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.251
Gloria's been flagged.

12:08.251 --> 12:09.168
What?
Why?

12:09.168 --> 12:11.004
I don't know.
Take a look at this.

12:11.004 --> 12:14.048
These are our friends in DC.
That's a 202 area code.

12:14.048 --> 12:15.258
Yeah, you want me
to contact them?

12:15.258 --> 12:16.050
You know what?

12:16.050 --> 12:18.511
I think we just did,
by accessing this file.

12:18.511 --> 12:19.929
It's cross-referenced.

12:19.929 --> 12:22.307
Could be DEA, FBI ...

12:22.307 --> 12:24.225
I figure we got about
two hours before ...

12:24.225 --> 12:26.728
we get a visit by somebody
in a suit and a pair of ray-bans.

12:53.486 --> 12:54.946
Knock, knock, knock.

12:58.074 --> 12:59.326
Everything okay?

12:59.326 --> 13:00.702
Yeah, it's fine.

13:01.745 --> 13:02.746
You sure?

13:04.289 --> 13:06.458
Sometimes it's difficult
to have family.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.960
Sometimes,
it's more difficult not to.

13:09.586 --> 13:10.712
True.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.675
Okay.
Interesting striations?

13:16.217 --> 13:18.845
I fired this projectile out
of a standard .22,

13:18.845 --> 13:20.680
like the one they
used on Gloria.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.099
A single set of striations.

13:23.099 --> 13:25.810
But the one
pulled out of Gloria ...

13:27.479 --> 13:28.772
...had two sets.

13:31.358 --> 13:33.026
Okay.

13:34.069 --> 13:35.695
Confirming silencer.

13:35.695 --> 13:37.322
Yes, but it was a weird one.

13:37.322 --> 13:39.324
You know that substance
you sent to trace?

13:39.324 --> 13:40.492
It was neoprene.

13:40.825 --> 13:42.702
So this is what
I think happened.

13:42.702 --> 13:44.371
Well, I mean, you know,

13:44.371 --> 13:46.456
anyone with half a brain
can build a silencer,

13:46.456 --> 13:51.252
so the suspect attached metal
tubing to the end of the barrel,

13:51.252 --> 13:55.256
and then filled the suppressor
tube around it with bronze, wool,

13:55.256 --> 13:59.594
and lithium grease to dissipate
any expulsion of gasses...

13:59.594 --> 14:01.805
and to keep the explosion
down, and then,

14:01.805 --> 14:05.225
finally, capped it all off with
a black neoprene washer.

14:05.767 --> 14:08.561
So you have one set of
striations from the barrel...

14:10.647 --> 14:12.649
... another set from the silencer, ...

14:13.274 --> 14:14.317
and then, finally,

14:14.317 --> 14:17.737
the washer fragments to
silence any escaping sound.

14:19.906 --> 14:22.283
Did you run these bullets
through IBIS? I did.

14:22.283 --> 14:24.744
And the first set of striations
matches an unsolved ...

14:24.744 --> 14:27.706
four-year-old armed
robbery in Uleta.

14:28.123 --> 14:31.251
Uleta? Who was
the case detective?

14:31.584 --> 14:32.627
Your sister-in-law.

14:35.755 --> 14:36.798
Family.

15:05.243 --> 15:06.411
Hi.

15:08.705 --> 15:09.873
Hi.

15:13.001 --> 15:14.502
I'll meet you at my desk.

15:14.711 --> 15:15.754
Okay.

15:31.269 --> 15:33.021
Here's the file you
called me about.

15:34.898 --> 15:36.149
You remember this case?

15:36.149 --> 15:39.069
Oh, yeah.
Savings and Loan in Uleta.

15:39.903 --> 15:43.448
Two suspects, ski masks,
twenty-twos,

15:43.448 --> 15:46.910
terrorized the tellers and
got away with 600 k in cash.

15:46.910 --> 15:48.495
How about eyewitnesses?

15:48.495 --> 15:51.665
Teller noticed a dark mole
on one of the suspect's neck.

15:51.956 --> 15:55.752
Only other one brave enough to
look at them was a security guard.

15:56.044 --> 15:58.421
They shot him in the head.
Twice.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.549
Father of three.

16:06.596 --> 16:08.723
I really wanted to give
his widow something.

16:08.723 --> 16:12.102
A year and half later,
I can't even bring her a name.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.187
I think I may be able to.

16:14.187 --> 16:17.649
Somebody slapped a silencer on the
weapon that was used in your robbery,

16:17.649 --> 16:19.901
and yesterday,
at the Agramonte Hotel,

16:19.901 --> 16:22.487
the same MO was
used to execute a woman.

16:22.487 --> 16:24.030
Yeah, I saw that on the news.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.699
A lot of people did.

16:25.907 --> 16:28.743
You're thinking this is some
kind of a wake-up call?

16:30.829 --> 16:33.748
From one of the guys
who pulled my S & L job.

16:33.748 --> 16:35.667
I think there's a chance of it.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.836
Okay, what's the vic's name?

16:37.836 --> 16:39.504
She's been flagged
by Washington,

16:39.504 --> 16:41.798
so I can only tell
you who she isn't.

16:42.841 --> 16:44.009
This is going to help.

16:46.094 --> 16:47.262
So thank you.

16:49.055 --> 16:51.141
Gloria Tynan of
Miami-Dade county,

16:51.141 --> 16:52.976
her only court
appearance ...

16:52.976 --> 16:54.936
is for a noise
complaint over her dog,

16:54.936 --> 16:56.604
a shih tzu named Toodles.

16:56.604 --> 16:57.814
A few speeding tickets.

16:57.814 --> 16:58.898
Car?

16:58.898 --> 16:59.941
Dodge neon.

16:59.941 --> 17:01.609
And a one-carat emerald.

17:01.818 --> 17:04.529
She also reported a theft
a half year ago at her job.

17:04.529 --> 17:07.449
Regal harbor boat
tours, I'm guessing.

17:07.449 --> 17:09.826
Turns out Jeff Gabler's
father owns the place,

17:09.826 --> 17:11.869
runs a day tour to
the keys and back.

17:11.869 --> 17:12.704
Wait a second.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.040
Jeff Gabler,
Lieutenant Gabler from narco?

17:15.040 --> 17:15.874
Yeah.

17:15.874 --> 17:19.210
Anyway, she filed a report,
said someone lifted her wallet.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.295
Cops never found the guy.

17:20.295 --> 17:21.921
That's because there is no guy.

17:21.921 --> 17:25.090
We are being detoured into
the land of make-believe.

17:25.925 --> 17:27.469
You're talking
about the Feds?

17:27.469 --> 17:29.429
When they put you
under protection,

17:29.429 --> 17:30.221
for whatever reason,

17:30.221 --> 17:32.682
they make up a backstory
based on cops,

17:32.682 --> 17:33.683
and cops' families.

17:33.683 --> 17:35.852
Because they'll keep
the story straight.

17:36.269 --> 17:38.647
Hold on a second.
Horatio.

17:39.064 --> 17:41.107
Hey, I'm at the
hotel checking the,

17:41.107 --> 17:42.609
phone records here.

17:42.609 --> 17:44.069
And there's one call...

17:44.069 --> 17:47.322
that Gloria Tynan made from
a poolside phone, land line.

17:47.322 --> 17:49.407
I figured there's some reason
she didn't use her cell.

17:49.407 --> 17:51.826
Okay, that's because she
didn't want anybody to know.

17:51.826 --> 17:54.996
Right, so I cross-checked it,
and I got an address.

17:54.996 --> 17:58.083
Coconut Grove,
2420 Lyons Avenue.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.168
Okay, nice work.
I'll call Hagen.

18:00.168 --> 18:01.252
All right.

18:04.923 --> 18:05.757
Yesterday afternoon,

18:05.757 --> 18:09.052
a woman by the name of
Gloria Tynan was murdered.

18:09.052 --> 18:10.095
Do you know her?

18:10.845 --> 18:13.056
No. I ...

18:13.056 --> 18:14.724
I don't think so, why?

18:14.724 --> 18:19.062
We traced a phone call that she
made from the Agramonte hotel...

18:19.062 --> 18:20.647
to your address.

18:32.158 --> 18:32.993
I don't know ...

18:33.827 --> 18:35.286
Where you got that name.

18:36.496 --> 18:37.539
Gloria.

18:41.793 --> 18:43.211
It's Gina.

18:43.837 --> 18:45.505
This is my daughter.

18:50.218 --> 18:52.679
I haven't seen her
in over a year.

18:53.305 --> 18:55.724
But you knew she lived
here in Miami, didn't you?

18:56.224 --> 18:57.517
I didn't know where.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.603
Because she couldn't tell you.

19:03.315 --> 19:05.150
Did she have a
man in her life?

19:05.567 --> 19:06.693
She was ...

19:07.944 --> 19:11.823
seeing this guy
in Pennsylvania ...

19:12.032 --> 19:13.366
Did you know his name?

19:13.867 --> 19:14.868
She just ...

19:14.868 --> 19:17.662
always called him
her boyfriend.

19:18.705 --> 19:20.790
He showered her
with gifts.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.584
He tried to buy me.

19:22.584 --> 19:24.085
I didn't like that.

19:26.171 --> 19:28.006
But you made an
exception in this case.

19:28.006 --> 19:30.592
I notice you're wearing
the same ring she did.

19:32.677 --> 19:34.012
He made me feel ...

19:35.055 --> 19:39.225
if I didn't take it,
like he would be offended.

19:41.353 --> 19:42.771
Maybe even ...

19:42.771 --> 19:45.315
hurt me or Gina.

19:46.358 --> 19:49.194
Um, I'm, I, I ...

19:49.194 --> 19:51.404
I don't know how
to explain it.

19:51.404 --> 19:53.490
I think you just did
a very nice job.

19:57.035 --> 19:59.245
Do you have the box
the ring came in?

20:00.622 --> 20:01.873
I ...
I could look.

20:05.835 --> 20:07.545
You move in
recently, Mrs. Cusack?

20:08.588 --> 20:09.381
Three months ago.

20:09.381 --> 20:13.969
Gina sent me a letter in Philly
asking me to move to Florida.

20:14.678 --> 20:16.680
Even helped with the rent.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.432
I told her this house was
way over my head.

20:19.933 --> 20:21.643
Look at all this glass.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.395
But you didn't see her?

20:23.728 --> 20:25.397
She calls me every Tuesday.

20:25.605 --> 20:30.068
Same time.
Promised that ...

20:31.069 --> 20:33.780
she was going to be
able to see me soon.

20:34.823 --> 20:36.157
On that cordless phone?

20:38.660 --> 20:39.995
Why? What's wrong
with the phone?

20:39.995 --> 20:41.037
Nothing at all.

20:46.626 --> 20:48.712
Can you find who
did this to Gina?

20:49.754 --> 20:52.716
I'm going to do my best.
And this ...

20:53.049 --> 20:55.385
is really going to help.
Okay?

20:57.470 --> 20:59.848
It was a legitimate
question, the cordless.

20:59.848 --> 21:01.558
One we already
had the answer to.

21:01.558 --> 21:03.810
Why add to
the lady's guilt?

21:03.810 --> 21:07.230
Town car, tinted windows,
take a guess.

21:07.647 --> 21:08.690
Fan Belt Inspectors?

21:08.690 --> 21:10.275
Nope, U.S. Marshals,

21:10.275 --> 21:12.444
Witness Protection,
baby-sitters.

21:31.796 --> 21:34.966
I guess I couldn't help but
notice your car over here.

21:35.175 --> 21:37.510
U.S. Deputy
Marshal Ardine.

21:37.510 --> 21:40.555
Marshal, I just got this off
Gina Cusack's mom.

21:40.555 --> 21:42.849
I was going to run it
for prints on the boyfriend,

21:42.849 --> 21:44.309
but after all is said and done,

21:44.309 --> 21:46.645
it would just spit out
background info ...

21:46.645 --> 21:48.521
from your imagination.

21:48.521 --> 21:49.564
Right?

21:49.689 --> 21:51.608
All part of protecting
our witness.

21:51.608 --> 21:54.569
Yes, from Philly,
deals in swag.

21:54.569 --> 21:55.779
I think I have an idea,

21:55.779 --> 21:58.365
but why don't you tell me how
Gina ties in to your witness?

21:58.448 --> 22:00.784
Let's just say he's
a married man,

22:00.784 --> 22:02.494
and she's not his wife.

22:02.494 --> 22:04.996
So you put his mistress
into the program,

22:04.996 --> 22:06.331
but didn't protect her.

22:06.331 --> 22:07.832
We protected her.

22:07.832 --> 22:11.461
Gave her a new identity, a job,
a new life near our primary.

22:11.461 --> 22:13.421
It's not our fault she
broke protocol,

22:13.421 --> 22:14.172
contacted her mother,

22:14.172 --> 22:15.966
dragged her down
from Philly.

22:15.966 --> 22:17.801
Should have checked
mom's phone.

22:17.801 --> 22:18.885
Did.

22:19.302 --> 22:20.804
House has a
secure land line.

22:20.804 --> 22:22.138
Single cordless phone.

22:22.138 --> 22:25.350
So Gina's killer sat out
here with a receiver,

22:25.350 --> 22:27.644
and picked up
the radio waves...

22:27.644 --> 22:31.481
from the cordless and tracked
her to the Agramonte hotel.

22:31.481 --> 22:35.360
So you guys slipped up
and Gina paid.

22:35.568 --> 22:36.695
Nice going.

22:38.363 --> 22:39.489
Hey!

22:40.699 --> 22:42.283
Don't go digging
around this, huh?

22:42.283 --> 22:44.119
We don't want our
witness spooked.

22:44.536 --> 22:46.413
A professional hit ...

22:46.413 --> 22:49.040
was made on a girl that
he brought to Miami.

22:49.291 --> 22:50.792
So maybe he got
bored with her,

22:50.792 --> 22:52.961
and maybe I'll find
his prints on this.

22:52.961 --> 22:55.171
Either way,
I'll get him next.

22:55.171 --> 22:56.506
You're way off.

22:56.506 --> 22:57.382
Left field.

22:57.382 --> 22:59.718
Am I?
Marshal?

23:00.468 --> 23:02.554
Is that why you're here?

23:15.799 --> 23:16.967
That's two.

23:19.052 --> 23:20.470
One still out there.

23:21.722 --> 23:23.140
Knock, knock, knock.

23:23.557 --> 23:24.516
Hey.

23:24.725 --> 23:27.269
Red one in the middle
is from the gift box.

23:27.811 --> 23:30.021
It's the only one that didn't
belong to Gina or her mom.

23:30.021 --> 23:31.481
'Kay, what about
the hotel?

23:31.481 --> 23:33.358
All these little
green ones.

23:33.358 --> 23:34.359
It's pretty messy.

23:34.359 --> 23:37.446
I'm trying to combine them
to get one workable print.

23:37.446 --> 23:39.489
Narrowed it down to
three sets of ten.

23:39.489 --> 23:43.243
But these hotel rooms are going
to force me into early retirement.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.247
Come on,
I know you're out there.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.793
There it is.

23:51.793 --> 23:53.962
Take it to the house.

23:54.254 --> 23:56.006
Double loop,
minimal distortion.

23:56.006 --> 23:57.299
Let's run it.

23:57.299 --> 23:58.341
Running it.

24:03.513 --> 24:05.057
Here we go.
Edward Hinkle.

24:05.057 --> 24:07.517
Husband to Mary,
father of Jessica.

24:07.934 --> 24:09.561
Social security number,

24:09.561 --> 24:12.147
places of employment,
last four addresses.

24:13.398 --> 24:15.233
What about that
202 fed number?

24:15.233 --> 24:17.486
That's nice and tidy,
courtesy of uncle ...

24:20.197 --> 24:21.948
Speak of the devil.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.286
Well, if it isn't the wizard
from behind the curtain.

24:26.286 --> 24:28.830
Marshal Ardine tells me you're
barking up a dangerous tree.

24:28.830 --> 24:30.665
You wouldn't happen to know
where Edward Hinkle is,

24:30.665 --> 24:31.917
would you?
With us,

24:31.917 --> 24:34.169
preparing to testify
in a federal trial ...

24:34.169 --> 24:35.462
against his former
drug suppliers.

24:35.462 --> 24:37.172
Oh, yes, against
the Colombians.

24:37.172 --> 24:39.174
He's helping us defeat
a small army ...

24:39.174 --> 24:41.134
we've never had a chance
to get near till now.

24:41.134 --> 24:43.387
Case went nowhere
for three years ...

24:43.387 --> 24:44.388
till we got Hinkle
to squawk.

24:44.388 --> 24:46.515
What about the
murder in Uleta ...

24:46.515 --> 24:48.600
during the robbery
of a savings and loan?

24:50.602 --> 24:51.686
Thank you.

24:51.686 --> 24:52.646
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:52.646 --> 24:53.647
Eighteen months ago,

24:53.647 --> 24:55.148
two hard guys popped
a square badge,

24:55.148 --> 24:56.983
made off with the cash,
and you know what they say:

24:56.983 --> 24:59.403
You lie down with the devil,
you wake up in hell.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.030
I didn't know anything
about this, Horatio, I swear.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.949
We poly'd our witness
before we put him under.

25:03.949 --> 25:05.200
He didn't have
any outstandings.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.326
Well, actually,

25:06.326 --> 25:08.537
he must have lied to you,
because he does.

25:11.832 --> 25:13.208
Are you sure
about this?

25:13.625 --> 25:14.793
Yeah, I am.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.294
See this mole
right here?

25:16.294 --> 25:17.879
Well, there's an
eyewitness in Uleta ...

25:17.879 --> 25:19.506
that remembers it
quite well, too.

25:19.506 --> 25:22.175
So, you've got the same gun,

25:22.175 --> 25:25.095
two shots to the head,
just like Gina.

25:28.056 --> 25:29.307
Yeah, it's Sackheim.

25:29.307 --> 25:32.436
Checking on the status
of protectee Ed Hinkle.

25:32.436 --> 25:34.521
We've got eyes on
him, correct?

25:37.649 --> 25:38.734
All right.

25:39.151 --> 25:40.610
Keep me posted.

25:41.653 --> 25:43.071
Guess we've got
a small Wrinkle.

25:43.071 --> 25:44.197
Sounds like it.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.199
He must have
seen your, uh ...

25:46.199 --> 25:48.368
hotel hit on the evening
news and took a walk.

25:48.368 --> 25:49.578
So Mr. Hinkle's in the wind?

25:49.578 --> 25:50.871
I'm sure it's just temporary.

25:50.871 --> 25:52.205
U.S. Marshals are on it right now.

25:52.205 --> 25:54.541
Okay, let's go talk to the
wife, then Mrs. Hinkle.

25:54.541 --> 25:56.626
I'm sure you've got her
stashed away somewhere.

25:57.377 --> 25:58.378
Yeah.

25:58.378 --> 25:59.463
I'll make some calls.

25:59.463 --> 26:00.839
Good.
Come on.

26:05.969 --> 26:07.179
Hey, Claudia.

26:07.387 --> 26:09.097
Can I get my
messages, please?

26:12.017 --> 26:13.185
Oh, tulips.

26:13.185 --> 26:16.605
Those are beautiful.
I love tulips.

26:16.605 --> 26:17.773
I know.

26:18.482 --> 26:19.816
Hey, dad!

26:19.816 --> 26:20.859
Hi, sweetie.

26:24.738 --> 26:26.156
Those aren't necessary.

26:26.156 --> 26:27.616
Yes, they are.

26:27.616 --> 26:29.284
Thanks for getting me home.

26:29.910 --> 26:31.620
Take a walk with me.

26:32.662 --> 26:33.914
You know I don't
like to lecture,

26:33.914 --> 26:35.457
because as far
as I'm concerned,

26:35.457 --> 26:36.708
everyone chooses
their own path.

26:36.708 --> 26:39.753
I'm just saying, maybe
you should cut back.

26:39.753 --> 26:42.881
I'm going to.
I mean that.

26:43.715 --> 26:44.841
Dad ...

26:44.841 --> 26:46.718
I don't expect you
to believe me.

26:48.387 --> 26:49.429
Hey, Cal.

26:50.389 --> 26:51.390
Hey, Tim.

26:51.807 --> 26:52.891
Hi.

26:54.226 --> 26:56.561
All right, well, I'll let
you get back to work.

26:56.561 --> 26:57.646
Okay.

26:57.646 --> 26:58.897
See you.

26:59.940 --> 27:01.483
Thanks for the flowers.

27:01.483 --> 27:02.526
You bet.

27:09.491 --> 27:12.077
We have reason to believe
she was with your husband ...

27:12.077 --> 27:13.829
just prior to her murder.

27:13.829 --> 27:16.498
Gina?
Gina from Philly?

27:16.832 --> 27:17.708
Yes.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.668
You guys brought
her down here, too?

27:19.876 --> 27:22.254
Her relocation was
arranged also, yes.

27:23.088 --> 27:25.215
I can't believe she was
down here with us.

27:25.549 --> 27:27.467
I can't believe
you did this to me.

27:27.801 --> 27:30.804
Ma'am, I'm with the Miami
Crime Lab and not the ...

27:30.804 --> 27:31.555
FBI.

27:31.555 --> 27:34.182
Can you tell me where
your husband might be?

27:34.182 --> 27:35.225
Frank?

27:36.560 --> 27:37.936
Probably out
spending his cash ...

27:37.936 --> 27:38.895
"Ed," ma'am, please.

27:38.895 --> 27:41.148
His alias is "Ed."
We've worked very hard to ...

27:41.148 --> 27:43.275
Ed, Frank.
Gotrocks,

27:43.275 --> 27:45.819
Mr. I-deal-in-cash-only,
whatever, all right?

27:45.819 --> 27:48.071
Ma'am, could you
talk about his cash?

27:48.697 --> 27:50.198
He squirreled
money away.

27:50.198 --> 27:52.325
What, in addition to the stipend
we gave him to get settled?

27:52.325 --> 27:54.369
He has stacks of money.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.496
I just don't know where.

27:56.496 --> 27:57.664
Did he ever give you any?

27:57.664 --> 27:59.041
He never did in Philly.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.834
I don't know why
he would start now.

28:02.711 --> 28:03.754
I sneak it ...

28:03.962 --> 28:05.881
out of his wallet
when he's sleeping.

28:07.257 --> 28:08.800
Do you have any
on you now?

28:12.763 --> 28:13.638
What if I did?

28:16.433 --> 28:17.893
I could catch him with it.

28:43.668 --> 28:44.669
Tell Frank ...

28:45.712 --> 28:47.381
if he hadn't kept Gina ...

28:49.466 --> 28:50.926
I never would've done this.

29:05.607 --> 29:07.234
Hi, honey.
What are you up to, huh?

29:08.068 --> 29:09.194
Excuse me.

29:10.028 --> 29:12.197
I'll be right over there.
I have customers.

29:12.948 --> 29:14.658
Hi.
Hi.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.702
What are you working on?

29:17.411 --> 29:22.624
A farm with cows and
a pony and some lambs.

29:23.291 --> 29:24.292
It's pretty.

29:24.918 --> 29:26.503
I could draw you one.

29:27.546 --> 29:29.798
Right now I have
to go back to work,

29:29.798 --> 29:31.216
but I could come
back another time...

29:31.216 --> 29:32.467
and you could
draw me one.

29:33.301 --> 29:35.512
Will you really come back?

29:38.140 --> 29:39.349
You know what?

29:39.349 --> 29:41.768
For you, I'll come back.

29:43.437 --> 29:44.438
Okay?

29:44.771 --> 29:45.814
Keep up the good work.

29:50.861 --> 29:53.155
I've been watching these
pool attendants work.

29:53.905 --> 29:56.241
They all kneel when
they serve a guest.

29:56.241 --> 29:57.409
None of them
wear sunglasses,

29:57.409 --> 29:58.952
'cause the hotel
insists on...

29:58.952 --> 30:01.038
establishing eye
contact with the guests.

30:01.038 --> 30:02.831
Except this guy.

30:02.831 --> 30:04.958
No kneeling,
lousy tan.

30:05.459 --> 30:08.045
And you're sure it's not Ed
Hinkle, our federal witness.

30:08.086 --> 30:10.797
Nah. I compared it
to his DMV photo.

30:10.797 --> 30:13.383
Watch this guy make his
way over to the cabana.

30:14.718 --> 30:16.511
Now watch his
stack of towels.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.473
Each time he ducks
behind the cabana,

30:19.473 --> 30:21.349
he reappears,
there's one less towel.

30:22.809 --> 30:24.102
There's seven left.

30:24.853 --> 30:27.314
Six left.
Five.

30:28.357 --> 30:33.570
Now here's Gina.
Watch.

30:35.447 --> 30:36.490
Five still.

30:37.866 --> 30:39.117
He doesn't give her one.

30:39.534 --> 30:41.620
Well, he had
something else for her.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.288
Maybe he left
something behind.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.450
James Fukes.

32:01.450 --> 32:04.703
He did six years prison time
in coal township, Pennsylvania.

32:05.328 --> 32:06.830
Armed robbery
in Philadelphia.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.833
He hijacked a truckload full
of high-end electronics.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.002
Five-eleven,
185, dark hair.

32:12.002 --> 32:13.253
Well, if you don't
believe the video,

32:13.253 --> 32:14.755
believe the DNA,
he's our shooter.

32:14.755 --> 32:17.883
Okay, let's call up
his known associates.

32:20.510 --> 32:21.553
There are none.

32:21.553 --> 32:22.679
Yes, there are ...

32:23.096 --> 32:25.682
but the Feds have
deleted them.

32:26.016 --> 32:27.184
You've got to
understand ...

32:27.184 --> 32:29.019
the magnitude of the witness
protection program.

32:29.019 --> 32:31.313
You've got DOJ, DEA,

32:31.313 --> 32:33.231
you've got the marshals over here
dealing with the paper trail.

32:33.231 --> 32:35.108
We Fibbies, we just
deal with the trial.

32:35.108 --> 32:37.819
So not even you knew that
Frank was Jimmy's old partner.

32:37.819 --> 32:39.821
No.
So ...

32:42.199 --> 32:45.410
Jimmy Fukes has the gun they
used in the armed robbery ...

32:45.410 --> 32:46.703
they pulled together.
Yes, in Uleta...

32:46.703 --> 32:48.205
Jimmy got the gun;
Frank got the money.

32:48.205 --> 32:51.041
And now Jimmy's in town
for his cut of the proceeds.

32:51.041 --> 32:54.378
By placing Frank in the program,
he got out of paying Jimmy.

32:55.420 --> 32:56.755
And by killing Gina,

32:56.755 --> 32:59.132
Jimmy sent a message
to Frank to pay up.

32:59.132 --> 33:01.343
And now they're both
in the wind. Yeah.

33:01.343 --> 33:04.596
And so, when we find
the money, we'll find them.

33:11.493 --> 33:13.537
All the bills you got
from Frank's wife...

33:13.537 --> 33:16.790
traces of cotton fiber,
dust, chrysanthemums.

33:16.790 --> 33:17.582
Wait a minute.

33:17.582 --> 33:19.126
You mean like the plant?

33:19.126 --> 33:22.671
It's impregnated in all U.S. Paper
currency to reduce bacteria levels.

33:23.005 --> 33:25.132
But this one bill,

33:25.132 --> 33:27.342
bottom of the stack,
it has an additional trace.

33:27.592 --> 33:30.637
A peroxygen compound,
combined with a surfactant.

33:30.637 --> 33:32.306
A synthetic soap.

33:32.306 --> 33:34.016
Add malic acid,
you get virkon.

33:34.016 --> 33:34.850
Exactly.

33:34.850 --> 33:37.227
New disinfectant
introduced last year...

33:37.227 --> 33:38.020
to combat
cruise-ship viruses.

33:38.020 --> 33:40.772
They use it on all kinds
of boats now, right?

33:42.357 --> 33:44.067
Regal Harbor
Boat Tours.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.153
Right.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.531
So Frank asked Gina
to stash his cash at work.

34:05.714 --> 34:07.382
That's why it was
only on one bill.

34:07.382 --> 34:08.717
The bottom one.

34:09.009 --> 34:10.969
So she's in charge
of the cash.

34:10.969 --> 34:13.096
When Frank finds out
she's dead ...

34:13.096 --> 34:16.058
He jumps on this afternoon's
tour boat to grab his money.

34:16.475 --> 34:18.643
Round trip to the keys;
no stops.

34:18.643 --> 34:21.103
So if he makes it on the
boat there's no getting off ...

34:21.103 --> 34:23.148
should be back after
the Regal Sunset Dinner.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.900
Okay, call Hagen and
tell him to meet me there.

34:26.109 --> 34:27.069
Okay.
What about Sackheim?

34:27.069 --> 34:28.110
Let him sit.

34:47.630 --> 34:48.799
This is the one.
Stand by.

34:58.684 --> 35:00.727
Nobody moves
until we see him.

35:01.561 --> 35:03.647
Folks, on "go."

35:13.782 --> 35:14.825
Waiting on a visual.

35:19.788 --> 35:20.831
I don't see him.

35:26.628 --> 35:27.587
There he is.

35:28.130 --> 35:29.339
We got him.
White ball cap.

35:29.339 --> 35:30.590
Move!

35:32.676 --> 35:33.969
Oh, hey.

35:33.969 --> 35:35.971
I'm not the Taliban
over here.

35:35.971 --> 35:37.097
Sir, you're going to have
to come with us.

35:37.097 --> 35:38.098
What are you talking about?

35:38.098 --> 35:39.391
I was on a cruise
I was ...

35:39.391 --> 35:40.892
Give me that.
That's my bag.

35:42.978 --> 35:45.814
You should call Special
Agent Sackheim, FBI.

35:46.315 --> 35:50.736
I'm part of a high top-secret operation
against some Colombians, huh?

35:51.069 --> 35:52.571
Anti-American
drug dealers.

35:52.571 --> 35:54.406
Yeah, you're a real patriot.

35:56.074 --> 35:58.577
Know a Savings and Loan
that's been missing this.

35:59.328 --> 36:00.662
Let go of my witness.

36:01.705 --> 36:04.374
As soon as he gives
me Fukes, I'll let him go.

36:04.374 --> 36:06.376
He testifies in 48 hours.

36:06.376 --> 36:07.794
This can happen quickly.

36:07.794 --> 36:11.131
If you're proposing what I think
and Fukes kills my witness ...

36:11.131 --> 36:13.050
Fukes wants his money.

36:13.050 --> 36:14.259
He's not going to
touch anybody.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.345
So why don't you
calm down.

36:29.524 --> 36:33.278
Frank left a message on Jimmy's
home machine in Philly at what time?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.738
10:58 P.M.

36:35.364 --> 36:37.449
It's 7:30 A.M., people.

36:37.658 --> 36:39.785
If he's here in Miami,
he may never check it.

36:39.785 --> 36:41.244
Okay, he is not on vacation.

36:41.244 --> 36:42.329
This is business.

36:42.329 --> 36:43.205
Don't worry,

36:43.205 --> 36:45.415
Jimmy checks his machine
more often than he blinks.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.171
It's him.
Land line.

36:51.171 --> 36:52.255
Keep him on.

36:53.715 --> 36:54.925
This is your friend from Philly.

36:54.925 --> 36:56.385
What are you,
Pauly Walnuts?

36:56.385 --> 36:57.678
I know who you
are, Frank.

36:57.678 --> 36:58.887
Let's do this.

36:58.887 --> 37:00.055
You screwed me.

37:00.055 --> 37:01.306
And you got my attention.

37:02.349 --> 37:03.809
Pick a place.

37:03.809 --> 37:06.019
You're rolling over on me,
aren't you, Frank?

37:06.019 --> 37:07.854
What, do you
think I'm stupid?

37:08.897 --> 37:09.940
Did we get him?

37:14.945 --> 37:16.154
No.

37:17.197 --> 37:18.448
All right.

37:18.448 --> 37:20.117
Frank gave it his best shot.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.786
Come on.
We've got testimony to run.

37:22.786 --> 37:25.205
Hang on a minute.
Hang on a minute.

37:27.291 --> 37:29.251
My suspect is still at large.

37:29.251 --> 37:31.169
I want to hear about
Jimmy Fukes.

37:31.795 --> 37:32.963
I might have met
him once.

37:32.963 --> 37:34.381
He killed my girlfriend.
What do you want me to say?

37:34.381 --> 37:35.841
I want you to
tell me the truth.

37:35.841 --> 37:38.010
Not the fairy tale
this nitwit gave you.

37:38.010 --> 37:40.304
Tell me the truth; Jimmy Fukes.
Let's go.

37:43.223 --> 37:45.017
I've known him
since kindergarten.

37:45.017 --> 37:46.852
We used to skip
school together.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.979
Going down to the arcade,

37:48.979 --> 37:50.314
knock off some
gumball machines.

37:50.314 --> 37:51.773
What did you
do with the money?

37:51.773 --> 37:55.027
Go to the track, get a
degenerate to bet a race for us.

37:55.777 --> 37:59.823
When we got older,
women, rings ...

38:00.574 --> 38:02.242
we both like the
jewel tones.

38:02.242 --> 38:03.619
You bet the smart money?

38:03.910 --> 38:05.120
On the horses?

38:07.247 --> 38:08.248
No, no, no.

38:08.248 --> 38:10.375
Hey, I bet the winners.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.711
Jimmy still chases the,
uh, the long shots.

38:12.711 --> 38:14.087
Five-to-one or better.

38:14.504 --> 38:16.256
Of course, he never
finds them, but ...

38:16.256 --> 38:18.967
People don't change,
do they?

38:31.897 --> 38:33.649
Turf club after the seventh.

38:33.857 --> 38:35.651
You are a sure bet, Jimmy.

38:37.444 --> 38:38.445
Where's your car?

38:40.947 --> 38:43.367
Let's look for Pennsylvania
tags, come on.

38:50.874 --> 38:52.542
Living in your car, Jimmy?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.301
A baby monitor.

39:01.301 --> 39:03.095
So I have kids at home.
So what?

39:03.095 --> 39:05.305
There's only one reason a
wise guy drives around ...

39:05.305 --> 39:06.264
with a baby monitor.

39:06.932 --> 39:08.517
Of course it's beautiful.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.727
I'm just taking one
day at a time.

39:15.941 --> 39:18.026
One day at a
time in paradise.

39:18.986 --> 39:19.778
Come on, mom,

39:19.778 --> 39:20.779
you got to admit
this beats wearing ...

39:20.779 --> 39:23.073
three layers just
to get to your mailbox.

39:23.073 --> 39:25.242
When am I going
to see you, Gina?

39:25.242 --> 39:27.953
You can't see me yet.

39:30.872 --> 39:33.292
I came here to see you.
Where are you?

39:33.292 --> 39:34.751
I'm at the Agramonte
right now.

39:39.464 --> 39:43.135
You drove to the hotel,
found her at the pool,

39:43.635 --> 39:45.721
and the costume
party began.

40:17.628 --> 40:19.212
Is this for the kids
at home, too?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.673
There's ten thousand guns
just like that out there.

40:21.673 --> 40:23.258
You're not going to be
able to prove a thing.

40:23.258 --> 40:26.511
That is a very dumb
thing to say to a CSI.

40:27.554 --> 40:30.849
Now, Jimmy, you capped
your silencer with neoprene.

40:31.475 --> 40:35.395
And trace results
from Gina's autopsy ...

40:35.395 --> 40:38.523
found rubber in her head,
also neoprene.

40:40.317 --> 40:42.944
Your gun, your bullets,
your crime.

40:48.784 --> 40:50.827
Frank was screwing me
out of money.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.454
All right, the robbery
was my idea.

40:52.454 --> 40:53.914
I scouted the place
for months before.

40:53.914 --> 40:55.624
He just showed up
on game day.

40:55.624 --> 40:57.501
Yes, but I am talking
about another crime.

40:57.501 --> 40:58.961
And there
is a detective ...

40:58.961 --> 41:00.253
right on the other side
of that glass ...

41:00.253 --> 41:03.423
who is anxious to talk to
you about the robbery in Uleta.

41:04.049 --> 41:05.467
But that's going to
have to wait.

41:06.843 --> 41:07.886
Hang out.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.773
When you're done,

41:19.773 --> 41:21.608
we'll process him
over at county.

41:22.442 --> 41:24.486
Uleta is going to want
to try him first.

41:24.486 --> 41:25.988
Okay, we'll wait our turn.

41:27.656 --> 41:30.617
Security guard's wife is
going to want to thank you.

41:30.617 --> 41:32.077
Well, we did it together.

41:35.122 --> 41:36.415
Horatio?

41:37.457 --> 41:38.750
Thanks.

41:41.878 --> 41:42.879
Lieutenant Caine ...

41:43.297 --> 41:44.298
I'll catch up with you.

41:44.631 --> 41:45.716
Yeah?

41:46.133 --> 41:47.217
We have a Wrinkle.

41:47.968 --> 41:49.052
I'm listening.

41:49.469 --> 41:51.138
I was just speaking
to Washington.

41:51.138 --> 41:52.347
You have got to be kidding me.

41:52.347 --> 41:53.724
The decision's from higher up.

41:53.724 --> 41:58.145
This guy killed an innocent
girl and a father of three children.

41:58.854 --> 42:00.731
Yeah, well, his attorney says...

42:00.731 --> 42:03.150
he's willing to help us build a
case against Joseph Berkeley.

42:03.150 --> 42:05.319
An alleged hit man for
the Mastello Crime Family.

42:05.319 --> 42:06.111
I know who he is.

42:06.111 --> 42:08.155
Jimmy's testimony ...

42:08.155 --> 42:10.657
could tie a dozen
murders to this assassin.

42:10.657 --> 42:13.785
What about the two lives I am
looking out for down here?

42:13.785 --> 42:14.995
What about them?

42:18.665 --> 42:20.709
The AG's personally
making this call.

42:20.709 --> 42:21.835
Details are being
worked out.

42:21.835 --> 42:22.628
It's going to happen.

42:22.628 --> 42:24.713
Look, I know it's tough.

42:24.713 --> 42:27.633
Do you?
You catching the red-eye?

42:40.979 --> 42:42.022
You got a minute?

42:59.873 --> 43:01.458
Claudia, I tell you,
they're wearing me out.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.585
Do you have the evidence
for the Hannagan case?

43:05.253 --> 43:06.630
Thank you.
Duquesne.

43:06.630 --> 43:07.422
Hi, Calleigh.

43:07.422 --> 43:09.299
It's Dana over at
the Whiskey Stop.

43:09.299 --> 43:10.092
Okay.

43:10.092 --> 43:13.387
I've stopped serving your dad and
he's refusing to take a cab home.

43:13.387 --> 43:15.305
I'll be there as soon
as I can break away.

43:15.305 --> 43:16.306
Thanks.

43:16.306 --> 43:17.349
Thank you.

43:32.990 --> 43:34.449
What can I get
for you, sir?

43:34.449 --> 43:36.201
I, um ...

43:36.201 --> 43:39.037
I just wanted to say hi to
Mary Hinkle and her daughter.

43:39.037 --> 43:40.038
Are they here?

43:40.038 --> 43:41.623
Well, Mary quit this morning.

43:41.623 --> 43:44.001
Said she and her little girl
were headed out west.

43:47.254 --> 43:49.840
You with the Miami-Dade
Police Department?

43:49.840 --> 43:51.008
Uh, yeah.

43:52.259 --> 43:54.219
She thought you
might drop by.

43:56.596 --> 43:58.056
Said you over-tipped her.

44:07.941 --> 44:09.151
Well, good for them.

44:10.193 --> 44:11.278
Good for them.
