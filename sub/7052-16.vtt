00:01.617 --> 00:05.145
"And the bear came across a fox,
and the fox said:

00:05.321 --> 00:09.553
'Bear, bear, stop right there.
There's a monster up ahead.'"

00:09.726 --> 00:14.322
- Okay, bedtime.
- No, no. This is the last book.

00:14.497 --> 00:19.059
Oh, I thought that the last book
was the last book.

00:19.235 --> 00:20.600
We are almost done.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.432
You guys work well together
and I don't like it.

00:25.575 --> 00:27.167
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Peter.

00:27.343 --> 00:28.503
Hi. What's wrong?

00:29.479 --> 00:31.913
- What's wrong?
- Is there something wrong?

00:32.082 --> 00:33.913
No, why? What's wrong with you?

00:34.084 --> 00:36.678
Uh, nothing.
I assumed there was an emergency.

00:36.853 --> 00:39.185
No. No emergency.

00:39.355 --> 00:40.788
What's up?

00:40.957 --> 00:44.154
Nothing. I was actually calling
for Rachel. Is she there?

00:46.129 --> 00:48.791
- Yeah.
- It's stupid. I can call back later...

00:48.965 --> 00:52.526
...if you're in the middle of something.
- No, no. She's right here.

00:52.736 --> 00:55.728
Uh, Rach, it's for you. It's Peter.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.739
Oh.

00:59.542 --> 01:03.444
Hey. Yeah, did you
remember it or not?

01:05.447 --> 01:06.813
Are you serious?

01:08.184 --> 01:12.348
- What is it?
- Aunt Liv, can we keep on going?

01:12.522 --> 01:16.151
- No. No, I don't know that one.
- Yeah.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.660
All right, hold on.
Hold on a second. Hold on.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.195
Uh...

01:22.365 --> 01:26.665
"'But I don't see any monster,'
the bear said. And he kept walking.

01:27.370 --> 01:31.170
Because he didn't believe
there was a monster up ahead."

01:32.308 --> 01:34.071
Aunt Liv?

01:34.277 --> 01:35.471
Yeah?

01:35.645 --> 01:38.671
Monsters aren't real, right?

01:39.082 --> 01:42.483
No, sweetheart. They're not.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.002 --> 02:00.594
Cameras are dark.

02:06.743 --> 02:09.940
- Let's go. We gotta move.
- I told you, relax. The alarm's disabled.

02:10.113 --> 02:13.446
- There might be a backup system.
- There isn't. I checked the security.

02:13.616 --> 02:17.347
Why don't you finish up in here?
I wanna see what's behind this door.

02:39.342 --> 02:41.572
Come on, Jonathan,
we gotta get out of here.

02:42.779 --> 02:44.770
Hold on a second.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.837
Stop right there!

03:10.006 --> 03:13.635
You should be arrested for what you do.
We've let them all go. All of them.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.402
These animals deserve better.

03:15.578 --> 03:18.138
How would you like to be caged up
and tortured?

03:18.314 --> 03:20.179
Shame on you for what you do.

03:20.383 --> 03:23.477
These are living creatures
and you murder them. You're a killer.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.746
Tell me you didn't
open that door in there.

03:25.922 --> 03:27.787
Yeah, you bet I did.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.926
- Get out. Now. All of you, get out!
- You should be arrested.

03:31.094 --> 03:35.155
- Experimenting on animals is a crime.
- Somebody shut her up. Ahh!

03:35.498 --> 03:37.125
Go.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.827
Let's go. Let's go!
Come on, get out, go.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.275
- Jonathan!
- No, no, no.

03:47.443 --> 03:50.503
Get to the car, get to the car. Go, go.

03:52.015 --> 03:54.347
- What was that?
- That thing grabbed that guy.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.985
Get out of here, step on it.
Do we call the police?

03:57.153 --> 03:59.348
We can't leave Jonathan.
We have to go back.

03:59.522 --> 04:02.013
- No, dude. Go, go, go.
- No, no.

04:02.191 --> 04:03.818
This is crazy, this is crazy.

04:06.462 --> 04:07.520
What is that?

04:07.697 --> 04:09.790
I don't know. I can't see anything!

04:34.524 --> 04:35.855
Chris?

04:36.659 --> 04:38.354
What did that?

05:10.727 --> 05:13.924
- One cream, one sugar.
- Thank you, Peter.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.413
- Peter, no!
- Walter, we talked about sharing.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.212
- That's not to eat. You've ruined it.
- It's an omelet.

05:37.387 --> 05:39.582
It's not an omelet.

05:41.457 --> 05:43.789
Oh, my... Ugh!

05:45.361 --> 05:48.592
- Why is there an ear in the omelet?
- It was an experiment.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.734
It was a protein-rich incubator.
It was growing.

05:51.901 --> 05:53.232
It was growing? That's perfect.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.762
No, it's not perfect. You just ruined it.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.099
- You could have died had you eaten it.
- Hello?

05:58.274 --> 06:01.801
You know, maybe in the future you
could do me a favor and put up a sign...

06:01.978 --> 06:05.277
...warning me not to confuse
your toxic playthings with breakfast.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.939
You should get your own breakfast
and not poach mine.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.553
That is hardly the point. I nearly
washed my face in a sink of acid.

06:11.721 --> 06:15.248
You hooked Gene up to the solar panels
and I nearly electrocuted myself.

06:15.758 --> 06:18.727
This is a lab.
You're the one who should be careful.

06:18.895 --> 06:21.159
You look both ways
when you cross the street.

06:21.330 --> 06:24.822
The difference being, if I don't,
I'm the only one who gets flattened.

06:25.001 --> 06:28.129
You, Walter, you live in a society
with other people...

06:28.304 --> 06:29.828
- Hey.
- What?!

06:30.006 --> 06:31.906
That was Olivia.

06:32.341 --> 06:35.071
Local P.D. found the vehicle
a couple hours ago.

06:35.244 --> 06:37.235
Three bodies inside.
Two male, one female.

06:37.413 --> 06:38.505
And the cause of death?

06:38.714 --> 06:40.682
Appear to have been attacked
by an animal.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.841
The coroner's never seen
anything like it.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.419
Whatever did this
doesn't appear to be indigenous.

06:45.588 --> 06:49.251
Well, wherever it is indigenous
to, I don't wanna live there.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.318
- How interesting.
- Some would say disgusting.

06:54.797 --> 06:57.732
Whatever did this
had enormous claws.

06:58.267 --> 07:01.134
Like those of a bear
or one of the big cats.

07:01.304 --> 07:04.831
Spread of the digit, V-shaped,
it's too wide for one of those creatures.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.876
Configuration closer to that of an eagle.
Of course, much, much larger.

07:10.046 --> 07:11.980
Hey, we're looking for Big Bird.

07:12.148 --> 07:15.606
Don't be ridiculous.
Perhaps a pterodactyl.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.518
Have Evidence techs bagged their IDs?

07:19.689 --> 07:22.123
No, I don't think
they were carrying any.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.018
- Maybe this is why.
- It's a Brockhage lock-pick gun.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.721
They work great.
A little bulky for my taste, but...

07:29.899 --> 07:32.265
These kids were out for more
than a joyride.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.560
- This is quite delicious.
- Where did you get that?

07:36.806 --> 07:39.331
- In the car, uneaten.
- What is the matter with you?

07:39.775 --> 07:42.642
Oh, forgive my son.
He's been in a mood all day.

07:42.812 --> 07:45.542
I figured "don't eat the evidence"
went without saying.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.048
It has no bearing on the case,
I assure you.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.013
Four drinks.

07:55.324 --> 07:56.416
Three bodies.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.424
There were four people in this group.
We're missing a body.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.691
- Have we searched the woods?
- Canine units canvassed the area.

08:04.867 --> 08:08.234
- We didn't turn up any bodies.
- Maybe one of them got away, survived.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.167
If they did,
they could answer questions.

08:10.339 --> 08:12.068
I'm gonna check local hospitals.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.337
See if the emergency room has anything
that lines up with an animal attack.

08:16.712 --> 08:20.546
All this stuff is from Junky Genies.
It's a fast-food joint up by MIT.

08:20.716 --> 08:24.550
Food is crap, but it's cheap and open late.
It's always filled with undergrads.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.881
I thought you falsified your degree
from MIT.

08:27.056 --> 08:30.583
Yeah, Peter. Why commit to anything
when you can just fake it?

08:31.194 --> 08:33.457
I spent some nights there.

08:33.629 --> 08:36.029
Maybe we should go through
the student database...

08:36.198 --> 08:38.429
...and see if we can ID
any of the victims.

08:58.421 --> 08:59.479
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:59.655 --> 09:03.455
I understand Chris Hawkins lives here.
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.718
Whoa. Yeah, Chris isn't here.

09:06.896 --> 09:09.387
I know. Mind if I asked you
a few questions?

09:09.565 --> 09:12.625
I'm Carl, and, no, I would love it.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.899
Come on in.

09:16.505 --> 09:17.597
Thank you.

09:23.913 --> 09:26.473
Oh, yeah. That isn't mine.

09:26.649 --> 09:30.915
That was left here by a stranger.

09:31.087 --> 09:34.523
Can I get you something?
Orange juice? Candy?

09:34.690 --> 09:36.749
How about some pants?

09:36.926 --> 09:39.417
Yeah, I can do that.

09:40.796 --> 09:45.199
- So how well do you know Chris?
- Oh, you know, okay.

09:45.401 --> 09:48.495
"Hey, how's it going?" "Nice."
"Whatever." "What's for dinner?"

09:48.938 --> 09:51.429
That kind of stuff.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

09:51.607 --> 09:53.837
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.171
Just because he doesn't seem
like the type.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.472
You know,
to get into FBI kind of trouble.

09:58.648 --> 09:59.979
Why do you say that?

10:00.149 --> 10:03.846
He's always making fliers,
going to rallies. You know, political.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.955
- So, what kind of causes?
- It's really just the one.

10:07.123 --> 10:12.618
Animals Forever, I think it's called?
Or... No, no, no. Animals First.

10:12.795 --> 10:16.356
- He was an animal-rights activist?
- Yeah, definitely.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.023
He'd save anything with a beak
or a claw.

10:19.535 --> 10:24.632
Jeez, whatever got to him
had some pretty nasty claws.

10:27.143 --> 10:30.874
- And some very large fangs.
- What is that?

10:31.047 --> 10:35.074
Gouges from the fangs
of most likely some type of viper.

10:35.251 --> 10:38.652
So this thing had the claws of a lion
and the fangs of a snake?

10:39.655 --> 10:42.556
It reminds me of a woman
I once knew in Cleveland.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.590
These punctures
are over 4 inches apart.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.991
I mean, that would make this snake
8 feet long.

10:48.164 --> 10:51.099
- Her name was Harriet something.
- How is everything?

10:51.267 --> 10:54.725
Well, apparently, you're looking
for a lion-snake named Harriet.

10:55.171 --> 10:56.570
Did you find anything at MIT?

10:56.739 --> 11:00.732
Yeah. The victims were all animal-rights
activists. A group called Animals First.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.378
They were breaking into labs
that were doing testing?

11:03.546 --> 11:07.448
And releasing the animals. Which would
explain the burglary tools and lack of ID.

11:07.616 --> 11:10.551
It wouldn't explain how
whatever it is these guys released...

11:10.720 --> 11:13.280
...was able to rip a door off their car
and kill them.

11:13.489 --> 11:16.754
Any idea what kind of animal
would be in a lab that could do this?

11:16.926 --> 11:19.292
Well, judging by the wounds...

11:19.495 --> 11:22.430
...I'd say two or three
different ones, actually.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.590
Right. A motley crew of lab animals
got together and decided...

11:25.768 --> 11:28.066
...to exact their revenge on mankind.

11:28.237 --> 11:32.367
Astrid, let's look up labs in the area
that do research with animals and...

11:32.541 --> 11:35.203
See if any of them reported break-ins?
Yep, I'm on it.

11:35.644 --> 11:38.272
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.960
Oh, no.

12:04.974 --> 12:10.276
This is Unit 81. We're responding
to the monster sighting on Route 30.

12:10.446 --> 12:12.539
Roger that, 81.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.420
It's always a monster.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.450
Monster must be housewife
for "raccoon."

12:25.561 --> 12:27.290
You hear that?

12:38.874 --> 12:40.637
Any leads on the fourth victim?

12:40.810 --> 12:42.368
No.

12:44.447 --> 12:46.005
What?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.844
Nothing.

12:53.389 --> 12:55.323
You called Rachel last night.

12:55.491 --> 12:58.289
- Anything important?
- Hardly. You know that song:

12:58.461 --> 13:00.952
"If you like pina coladas..."?

13:01.130 --> 13:04.463
We were trying to remember the name.
Turns out it's called, "Escape."

13:04.633 --> 13:05.998
So you two are friends now.

13:08.904 --> 13:10.201
Does that bother you?

13:12.341 --> 13:13.535
No.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.379
Hey, Charlie, what's up?

13:33.195 --> 13:35.060
Oh, good heavens.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.823
Astrid? Charlie just called.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.991
Animal Control got a call from a woman
in Newton who claims...

13:40.169 --> 13:42.330
...that she nearly hit a monster
on Route 30.

13:42.505 --> 13:45.167
I'm gonna meet him there.
Call me if you find anything?

13:45.341 --> 13:47.036
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Thanks.

13:47.209 --> 13:48.870
Olivia.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.709
Be careful.

13:53.148 --> 13:54.945
Thank you, Walter.

13:59.788 --> 14:02.086
What was that all about?

14:03.659 --> 14:05.251
Nothing.

14:06.195 --> 14:08.595
Just want her to be safe.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.710
Hello?

14:42.698 --> 14:47.829
It's Francis. I need medevac teams
and backup sent to my location.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.815
Charlie?

15:36.819 --> 15:38.446
Charlie?

15:43.826 --> 15:45.384
Charlie.

15:46.061 --> 15:49.053
- How bad is it?
- I don't know.

15:49.264 --> 15:51.027
I'm all right.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.358
- What was it?
- Big.

16:04.847 --> 16:05.871
What the heck is that?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.710
Put the stinger in here, please.
Now, please. In here.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.148
Excellent, thank you.
Thank you very much.

16:11.353 --> 16:14.447
Agent, I'd like you to get that eyed
down at the hospital.

16:14.623 --> 16:16.989
No, thanks. That won't be necessary.

16:17.426 --> 16:21.556
Agent Francis, I'm told
you were attacked by the beast.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.254
- What did it feel like?
- It hurt.

16:23.432 --> 16:27.266
No, I mean the animal's dermis.
Was it rough like a rhinoceros?

16:27.436 --> 16:33.773
I haven't felt any rhinos lately,
but it was coarse like sandpaper.

16:33.942 --> 16:38.072
And the metasoma, the tail,
was it segmented like a scorpion?

16:38.247 --> 16:41.739
I didn't get a good look at it.
It kept on knocking me on my ass.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.908
Perhaps you did,
you just can't remember.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.816
Trauma can do that.
I could hypnotize you...

16:46.989 --> 16:49.423
Walter, I think that
that's enough for the moment.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.923
It would be very helpful
to identify the traits.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.823
Are you okay?
Did you take something?

16:53.996 --> 16:56.965
Psychedelics?
No, not since Thursday, no.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.965
Walter, why don't you share
what you're thinking?

17:01.036 --> 17:05.665
I believe we may be dealing
with a transgenic species.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.641
- Which is what?
- It's an animal creation.

17:09.811 --> 17:13.612
An organism made up
of the genes of multiple species.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.682
The best of the best, as it were.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.684
You're saying that you think
the creature is man-made.

17:18.854 --> 17:21.185
Accelerated Darwinism.

17:21.356 --> 17:23.324
- Is that even possible?
- In theory, yes.

17:23.492 --> 17:26.518
Although one would have to solve
many problems.

17:26.694 --> 17:31.064
Incompatible species,
massive mutual rejection...

17:31.233 --> 17:34.964
...similar to when a transplant recipient
rejects a donor organ.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.627
And there's a reason for that.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.865
Mixing a bunch of species
to create a frankenrhino is unnatural.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.703
And a really bad idea.

17:41.877 --> 17:44.869
- Dunham.
- Hey, it's me. Is Charlie all right?

17:45.047 --> 17:47.982
- Yeah, he's okay.
- Thank God.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.085
Okay, you wanted me
to look into any labs...

17:51.253 --> 17:53.881
...that might house animals
near the first crime scene.

17:54.056 --> 17:55.455
And?

17:58.260 --> 18:01.752
- How can I help you, Agent Dunham?
- Dr. Swift.

18:01.964 --> 18:05.764
You could start by telling me what sort
of work you do here at Swift Research.

18:05.968 --> 18:08.095
Well, we're commissioned
by pharmaceutical...

18:08.270 --> 18:11.103
...and cosmetic companies
to test their products.

18:11.273 --> 18:15.539
To make sure they're safe
before using them in human trials.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.111
By testing them on animals first.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.545
It's an unfortunate
but necessary step.

18:21.717 --> 18:25.244
You know, it's better to have an animal
experience an allergic reaction...

18:25.420 --> 18:28.912
...to a certain perfume
so that you don't have to.

18:29.091 --> 18:31.753
Dr. Swift, are you aware
a group of college students...

18:31.927 --> 18:34.760
...were attacked and killed
near this facility last night?

18:34.930 --> 18:38.422
- Attacked? By whom?
- That's what we're trying to determine.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.535
We believe these students
may have been...

18:44.239 --> 18:47.299
- Are you okay?
- No, actually.

18:47.509 --> 18:52.242
We're three days behind on a deadline.
You'll excuse me if I seem insensitive.

18:52.414 --> 18:54.780
What does this have to do
with me and this lab?

18:54.950 --> 18:57.475
We believe they were
animal-rights activists.

18:57.653 --> 19:01.282
That they were killed after they broke in
and released animals...

19:01.456 --> 19:03.924
...from a facility
much like you have here.

19:04.092 --> 19:07.755
So you're suggesting
that a lab animal was responsible?

19:07.930 --> 19:10.797
Well, maybe one
that was genetically altered.

19:10.966 --> 19:12.831
Do you do any of that
sort of work here?

19:13.035 --> 19:16.334
No, Agent Dunham.
I told you we only test products.

19:16.538 --> 19:18.904
And what's more,
there was no break-in.

19:21.443 --> 19:22.808
Doing some cleanup work?

19:22.978 --> 19:25.674
Hundreds of animals
in and out of here every week.

19:25.848 --> 19:28.783
As I'm sure you can probably imagine,
the cleanup never ends.

19:28.951 --> 19:30.578
Mind if I take a look?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.915
Not to be a rude host,
but you actually do need a warrant.

19:34.323 --> 19:37.019
Understand, we deal
with billion-dollar trade secrets...

19:37.192 --> 19:41.652
...and I am obligated to respect
my clients' confidentiality.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.699
How would we accomplish that?

19:50.505 --> 19:53.872
Wait. Damn it, how can I concentrate
with your running around?

19:54.076 --> 19:55.805
Walter.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.305
Are you talking to me?

19:57.479 --> 19:59.037
No. Just thinking out loud.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.682
- Hey. Walter.
- Hey.

20:01.850 --> 20:05.115
Walter, I need you to tell me
what exactly you would need...

20:05.287 --> 20:08.779
...to create a genetic hybrid.
Like, specific items.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.289
So I can see if Robert Swift's
bought any of it.

20:11.460 --> 20:15.794
I would need some sodium bicarbonate,
and a house in the country.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.728
A place to be alone with my thoughts.

20:18.901 --> 20:23.634
Some Mahler for the late nights,
and time.

20:24.106 --> 20:26.097
A lot of time.

20:28.877 --> 20:31.641
I know,
it's like he's on another planet.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.974
You've seen him,
he's been like that all day.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.173
But can you focus him?

20:35.350 --> 20:39.116
Focusing Walter is, even at the best
of times, just a matter of degrees.

20:43.025 --> 20:45.516
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

20:46.929 --> 20:50.057
Hey, Walter, I need you to snap back
to Earth for a second...

20:50.232 --> 20:52.496
...and focus on something
that isn't about you.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.363
Oh, Peter.

20:55.270 --> 20:58.865
I'm afraid this is about me.
About my work.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.076
I found this book among my old files.

21:06.949 --> 21:10.385
What is this, Walter? Olivia.

21:10.552 --> 21:13.680
- Is this the creature?
- No.

21:14.389 --> 21:16.254
But I fear it is quite similar.

21:16.425 --> 21:20.953
- Where did you get this?
- I tried to make it, 20 years ago.

21:21.163 --> 21:25.429
- Are you saying that you created this?
- Not this one specifically.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.569
- My experiments were a failure.
- You knew.

21:28.737 --> 21:31.604
You knew all along that
this was connected to your work.

21:31.773 --> 21:34.970
You had information that could help us
but you kept it to yourself.

21:35.177 --> 21:38.203
My creatures didn't survive,
someone else finished my work.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.746
Who, Walter?
Who could have done this?

21:40.916 --> 21:42.975
Twenty years ago,
who were you working with?

21:43.485 --> 21:46.921
Kelvin Genetics. We were doing
classified work for the U.S. Army.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.488
- I need a name, Walter.
- Guys?

21:48.690 --> 21:51.250
- Do you remember anybody specific?
- No.

21:51.426 --> 21:55.328
- Guys, this body is moving.
- What?

21:55.497 --> 21:59.991
They're still alive. Quick, unzip it.
They may be suffocating.

22:01.003 --> 22:05.167
- Ugh! Maggots.
- No, not maggots, larvae.

22:05.340 --> 22:08.275
- From the creature.
- You mean these are baby monsters?

22:08.443 --> 22:11.310
Yes. We must collect them.
Peter, Petri dish.

22:13.715 --> 22:16.081
- Make it a bucket.
- I'm gonna be sick.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.913
- Two buckets.
- Walter, how is this even possible?

22:21.356 --> 22:23.119
The stinger.

22:24.326 --> 22:26.294
It must carry the eggs.

22:26.461 --> 22:29.828
Transfers them
to a suitable incubator.

22:29.998 --> 22:32.466
You mean it plants the eggs
when it stings you?

22:32.634 --> 22:35.797
Yeah. It's fascinating.

22:35.971 --> 22:38.132
Oh, God. Charlie.

22:38.673 --> 22:41.938
So far, there have been
three sightings in the greater Boston area.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.044
Two in Medford and one in Arlington.

22:44.246 --> 22:47.374
Authorities advise if you see it
or any other wild animal...

22:47.549 --> 22:49.380
...do not try to confront it yourself.

22:49.551 --> 22:53.317
Do you hear this? There's some kind
of mountain lion on the loose.

22:53.488 --> 22:56.855
- Mountain lion?
- Yeah.

22:57.025 --> 23:01.485
In Boston. Where does a mountain lion
come from in Boston?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.230
Maybe it escaped from the zoo.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.458
Well, I doubt that,
otherwise they would just say so.

23:06.635 --> 23:10.901
The mountain lion, also known
as a cougar or puma, is found in most...

23:11.073 --> 23:13.337
- Well, baby, that's why you married me.
- Why?

23:13.508 --> 23:16.705
So I can protect you from
all the scary things that are out there.

23:16.878 --> 23:21.747
- And who's gonna protect you?
- I told you, it's just a scrape.

23:21.917 --> 23:26.081
You know, bad guy, broken bottle.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.681
Nothing I haven't handled before
a dozen times.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.355
Who's that?

23:37.566 --> 23:38.999
- Liv.
- Charlie, hey.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.032
- What's up?
- Uh...

23:41.236 --> 23:44.899
- You okay?
- Yeah, Charlie.

23:46.108 --> 23:48.406
But you may not be.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.523
Electro-conductive gel
for the ultrasound.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.130
Enough with the suspense,
what is it exactly that we're looking for?

24:09.297 --> 24:13.233
I believe the stinger we found in you
may have carried the creature's embryos.

24:13.435 --> 24:16.495
I think this is why
the creature didn't eat you.

24:16.671 --> 24:18.832
I think you may be
carrying its offspring.

24:19.007 --> 24:21.066
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm pregnant?

24:21.643 --> 24:22.940
We're hoping not.

24:40.829 --> 24:43.593
- So?
- Ten times magnification.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.975
Is that it?

25:02.617 --> 25:04.084
I'm afraid so.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.612
One small piece of good fortune:

25:08.790 --> 25:11.918
At least the creature doesn't mate
in the traditional way.

25:12.694 --> 25:16.061
- Thanks, Walter. Great bedside manner.
- So, what do we do now?

25:17.232 --> 25:21.134
I don't know.
I can't simply remove them.

25:21.303 --> 25:25.296
They've already spread
throughout his system.

25:28.310 --> 25:31.074
Just give me a second. Astrid.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.715
Walter. Walter, calm down.

25:38.887 --> 25:41.947
Liv, the other victim...

25:42.524 --> 25:45.322
How are these things actually born?

25:45.527 --> 25:49.224
It doesn't matter
because it's not gonna go that far.

25:54.069 --> 25:57.505
Walter, there's gotta be something
that you can do. All right?

25:57.672 --> 26:00.903
Hey, you can't check out right now,
we cannot let this man die.

26:01.076 --> 26:02.737
Don't you think I know that, Peter?

26:05.847 --> 26:08.145
I'm thinking, damn it.

26:14.322 --> 26:17.689
Agent Farnsworth,
draw 25 milliliters of blood.

26:17.859 --> 26:21.454
- Peter, get some Trichloromide.
- What are you gonna do?

26:21.630 --> 26:23.495
Poison them.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.566
This is gonna pinch just a little bit.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.272
Careful, Peter, it's highly toxic.

26:40.982 --> 26:44.679
If this doesn't work,
how much time do I have?

26:45.287 --> 26:47.517
The last victim...

26:48.290 --> 26:50.190
...we figured...

26:50.592 --> 26:52.958
...24 hours after he was...

26:53.595 --> 26:55.529
Knocked up.

26:56.164 --> 26:57.631
Yeah.

26:57.999 --> 27:00.991
So I have about 16 hours.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.895
Careful.

27:05.607 --> 27:07.006
Okay, get your toy out.

27:09.477 --> 27:10.967
Hello?

27:11.146 --> 27:14.673
Hey, Catherine...
Oh, slow down, honey, be careful.

27:14.916 --> 27:18.317
Hey, yeah, sorry. Oh, the house?

27:18.486 --> 27:22.388
Yeah, we saw it yesterday.
It was perfect.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.025
Yeah, exactly what I was looking for.

27:30.265 --> 27:33.200
I made a few calls for you.
This is what I was able to get...

27:33.368 --> 27:35.529
...the Army to declassify
on Kelvin Genetics.

27:35.704 --> 27:38.195
Five lab assistants worked
with Dr. Bishop and Bell.

27:38.373 --> 27:42.366
All of them now in the private sector.
None working in biogenetics.

27:42.544 --> 27:44.739
- And Robert Swift?
- No connection.

27:45.847 --> 27:48.714
I've been through the missing-persons
records a dozen times.

27:48.883 --> 27:52.546
- There's nothing from local hospitals.
- You're thinking there was a fourth?

27:52.721 --> 27:54.586
If they're out there and impregnated...

27:54.756 --> 27:57.452
...then who knows how many more
we're looking at.

27:57.659 --> 27:59.923
Presumably we'd have
heard something by now.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.255
Any more sightings?

28:01.429 --> 28:04.193
- Not any within the last 10 hours.
- Maybe it's gone.

28:04.366 --> 28:07.460
Maybe it went into the river
or died from lack of proper food.

28:07.669 --> 28:11.196
Agent Dunham,
Peter Bishop's on line six.

28:14.075 --> 28:15.440
- Hey.
- It's bad news.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.738
The poison killed the larvae,
but also poisoned Charlie's blood.

28:18.913 --> 28:20.574
- Have you spoken to Charlie?
- Yeah.

28:20.749 --> 28:23.377
He's putting on a brave face,
but he's not doing well.

28:23.551 --> 28:25.746
Blood pressure's down,
kidneys are failing.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.980
- I don't understand.
- The larvae act like parasites.

28:29.190 --> 28:31.090
They feed on their host for nutrients.

28:31.259 --> 28:33.227
They're killing him so they can gestate.

28:33.395 --> 28:35.192
Did you tell her, Peter,
about the blood?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.890
- What blood?
- Walter has a theory.

28:38.066 --> 28:40.091
To trick the larvae
into self-destructing.

28:40.468 --> 28:41.730
How do we do that?

28:41.903 --> 28:45.930
Transfuse Charlie with the creature's
blood. Mix the mother's blood in.

28:46.107 --> 28:49.270
Maybe they'll think he's one
of their own, stop feeding and die.

28:49.444 --> 28:52.140
Which sounds crazy,
but he seems to think it'd work.

28:52.347 --> 28:54.577
Okay. Then that's what we'll do.

28:54.783 --> 28:57.411
- Bye.
- What?

28:58.486 --> 29:00.078
We need to find the creature.

29:01.122 --> 29:06.788
It's got three bedrooms so if we
wanna have another baby, we'll be fine.

29:06.961 --> 29:10.328
Oh, and the best part about it
is it's got this amazing yard.

29:12.967 --> 29:15.299
Oh, it's even got a tree house
for Tuck.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.165
Catherine, let me call you back.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.271
Tuck!

29:23.478 --> 29:25.673
Tuck, come out of there.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.378
Tuck! Come here!

29:38.059 --> 29:41.620
Medford, Waltham, Newton,
and an unconfirmed report...

29:41.796 --> 29:44.663
...of a giant snake out of Watertown.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.563
- What are you thinking?
- It doesn't make sense.

29:47.769 --> 29:51.205
I mean, something this big,
why aren't there more sightings?

29:51.372 --> 29:53.806
It's just a mild sedative.

29:54.142 --> 29:56.702
It might make you feel more relaxed.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.073
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.044
I'm sorry this has happened to you.

30:02.684 --> 30:04.652
It's not your fault.

30:06.688 --> 30:09.555
- They didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

30:10.158 --> 30:11.819
The creature.

30:12.327 --> 30:14.227
Where it came from.

30:15.697 --> 30:19.827
Astrid, I need a schematic
of the sewer. Section E3 and F5.

30:20.034 --> 30:21.558
- You've had a thought.
- Yeah.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.863
I think it's traveling underground.

30:25.006 --> 30:28.373
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.538
Look at that. All the sightings
are near major storm drains.

30:32.714 --> 30:35.080
Each one large enough
to accommodate the creature.

30:35.250 --> 30:40.119
That makes sense. If it's part tiger,
then it would prefer dark.

30:40.321 --> 30:42.050
And a python would seek out water.

30:42.223 --> 30:45.386
So it's probable only surfacing
to eat or to mate.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.862
- What?
- If it's traveling in the sewer...

30:50.031 --> 30:51.521
...then we have nothing.

30:51.699 --> 30:53.394
- It could be anywhere.
- It's okay.

30:53.568 --> 30:55.900
- We're making progress.
- No, it's not okay.

30:56.638 --> 30:59.106
You tell Agent Francis it's okay.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.873
I'll go talk to him.

31:11.653 --> 31:14.588
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hold him down. Hold him down!

31:14.756 --> 31:17.589
- Charlie.
- Lift his shirt.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.994
They're getting bigger.

31:34.208 --> 31:38.201
When? Did you get
any witness statements?

31:39.514 --> 31:42.540
Can you send me them
as soon as you get them?

31:42.717 --> 31:45.242
- Thank you.
- Another sighting?

31:45.420 --> 31:49.083
Yeah, this time in a public park
off Hawthorn.

31:49.290 --> 31:53.056
- Which is nowhere near the other places.
- There's no predictable pattern.

31:53.294 --> 31:56.491
This thing could show up anytime,
anywhere, and we'd have no idea.

31:58.366 --> 31:59.594
- Hello?
- Agent Dunham.

31:59.834 --> 32:02.234
Hey, this is
Carl Bussler from MIT.

32:02.403 --> 32:05.429
- What can I do for you?
- You said to call if anything came up.

32:05.607 --> 32:08.508
- I think maybe something might have.
- What is it?

32:08.710 --> 32:12.168
This kid Jonathan hasn't been in class
for the last few days.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.009
I don't know if he was friends
with Chris or whatever...

32:15.183 --> 32:17.674
...but he was into all that
animal-rights stuff too.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.217
Anyway, no one's seen him.

32:19.387 --> 32:21.548
Okay, I'll check it out.
What's his last name?

32:21.723 --> 32:24.089
Swift. Jonathan Swift.

32:26.327 --> 32:29.763
Miss? You can't go back there.

32:31.265 --> 32:32.391
Agent Dunham.

32:32.567 --> 32:33.693
You lied to me.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.597
- I did?
- You obstructed the course...

32:35.770 --> 32:38.398
...of an investigation
into the deaths of five people.

32:38.573 --> 32:41.599
- Will you excuse us for a minute?
- Dr. Swift.

32:41.776 --> 32:44.574
You failed to tell me
that your son, Jonathan, was at MIT.

32:44.746 --> 32:46.270
How is that relevant?

32:46.447 --> 32:49.644
Three of his classmates were torn
limb from limb the other night...

32:49.851 --> 32:52.581
...and he hasn't been seen since.
That would be relevant.

32:52.754 --> 32:55.552
I don't know how that happened.
My son was not involved.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.213
The last time you spoke to him?

32:57.392 --> 33:01.829
- A few days. He's very busy at school.
- Yes, I know. Politically active.

33:01.996 --> 33:05.056
Animals First? He wasn't too fond
of the work you did, was he?

33:05.233 --> 33:08.259
I really can't say.
Is this going somewhere?

33:08.436 --> 33:11.428
Yes, a motive. I believe that
he found out about your studies.

33:11.606 --> 33:15.406
That your lab was testing on animals,
and he and his friends broke in here.

33:15.576 --> 33:18.067
But what he didn't know
was that you do much more...

33:18.246 --> 33:20.680
...than just test on animals,
you create them.

33:20.882 --> 33:22.406
Dangerous genetic hybrids.

33:22.583 --> 33:26.019
We're done here. Any questions,
you have to go through my attorney.

33:26.187 --> 33:30.089
This thing has already killed five people
and infected one of our agents.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.625
As we speak, its offspring is growing
inside him, killing him.

33:33.795 --> 33:36.457
Do you really want his death
on your conscience?

33:36.664 --> 33:39.599
Now, your son is out there,
maybe injured, maybe infected.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.930
And I can help.
But you need to help me too.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.532
It didn't kill five people.

33:49.711 --> 33:51.508
Excuse me?

33:52.513 --> 33:54.538
It was seven.

33:58.519 --> 34:01.317
- Hello?
- Hey. Swift broke.

34:01.489 --> 34:03.855
He admitted the hybrid came
from his laboratory.

34:04.025 --> 34:06.789
Apparently he was collaborating
with a geneticist...

34:06.961 --> 34:10.362
...called Cameron Deglmann.
- Oh. Well, where is this guy?

34:11.199 --> 34:12.324
Dead.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.402
He was at the lab along with Swift's son
when the students released the creature.

34:16.571 --> 34:18.835
So, what is the link
to Kelvin Genetics?

34:19.005 --> 34:22.065
Well, that's the interesting part.
You got a pen?

34:22.243 --> 34:24.574
Good news. That was Olivia.

34:24.746 --> 34:27.873
Swift confessed. This monster
has nothing to do with your work.

34:28.049 --> 34:30.516
- What?
- Swift was working with a geneticist.

34:30.685 --> 34:33.984
For years he was pursuing this work.
A Cameron Deglmann?

34:34.155 --> 34:37.681
- Deglmann. Of course.
- Whoa, whoa, who's Deglmann?

34:37.859 --> 34:39.326
Pioneer in hybridization.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.396
Quite brilliant. It was his work that
inspired my research in the first place.

34:43.598 --> 34:46.089
It never even crossed your mind
he might be involved?

34:46.266 --> 34:49.498
- He had a very forgettable face.
- In the "more good news" column...

34:49.670 --> 34:53.003
...Olivia got the combination of animals
that went into the hybrid.

34:53.174 --> 34:56.337
- Oh, go on.
- Heloderma suspectum.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.741
Yes, a venomous lizard
native to North America.

34:58.913 --> 35:00.346
Also called the Gila monster.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.211
- Megarhyssa macrurus.
- Parasitic wasp, interesting.

35:03.384 --> 35:04.942
Desmodus rotundus and...

35:05.119 --> 35:08.782
- Wait. Did you say Desmodus rotundus?
- Yeah, why? What is that?

35:08.990 --> 35:11.117
It's a type of bat.

35:11.592 --> 35:14.254
Of course.
Why didn't I think of it before?

35:14.428 --> 35:15.554
Their immune system.

35:15.730 --> 35:18.858
Makes it a perfect candidate
for genetic hybridization.

35:19.033 --> 35:21.866
- I'm lost.
- Bats have a unique immune system.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.937
They can carry hundreds of diseases
without being affected.

35:25.106 --> 35:28.701
That same system makes it possible
for the creature to mature...

35:28.876 --> 35:31.504
...without rejecting its various parts.

35:32.246 --> 35:35.738
Bat was the missing ingredient...

35:35.917 --> 35:38.545
...that allowed the creature to survive.

35:39.086 --> 35:43.580
So now that you know what it is,
can you help Charlie?

35:44.525 --> 35:45.890
No.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.824
We'll still need a specimen
of the creature's blood.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.998
Okay.

35:51.165 --> 35:53.929
Okay, well, we know
what it's made of.

35:54.101 --> 35:56.331
We know that it moves
through the sewers.

35:56.537 --> 36:00.029
So can't we, I don't know,
like, bait it or something?

36:00.241 --> 36:03.438
Just so I'm clear, are you suggesting
that we go into the sewers...

36:03.611 --> 36:05.408
...and wait for this thing to eat us?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.604
- Well, no...
- Yes.

36:06.781 --> 36:08.248
- Yes.
- Only, no.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.316
- No?
- It's not interested in food.

36:10.484 --> 36:11.746
No.

36:11.919 --> 36:14.183
We do have something
that it is interested in.

36:14.355 --> 36:18.348
Bats are a highly maternal species.

36:19.627 --> 36:22.460
They're quite protective
of their young.

36:22.630 --> 36:24.791
Are you saying
that we can lure this thing...

36:24.966 --> 36:27.093
...by dangling those larvae
in front of it?

36:27.268 --> 36:29.099
Yes, but no.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.601
Oh, great. This again.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.262
It wouldn't be necessary
to be in front of it.

36:33.441 --> 36:37.434
Bats are capable of seeking out
their offspring from miles away.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.103
We've determined it's traveling
through the sewers.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.476
So we need to lure it
from a central location.

36:42.650 --> 36:46.177
Wonderful. We're gonna antagonize
this thing into chasing us, then what?

36:46.387 --> 36:49.379
Now that I have a better idea
of its biological makeup...

36:49.590 --> 36:50.852
...I think I can kill it.

36:51.025 --> 36:52.720
Assuming that you can provide us...

36:52.894 --> 36:55.522
...with 50-caliber incendiary rounds,
Agent Dunham.

36:55.696 --> 36:58.324
Well, that's not exactly
FBI standard issue, Walter.

36:58.499 --> 36:59.693
Are you sure about this?

36:59.867 --> 37:03.530
If my theory is correct,
and the bat traits are dominant...

37:03.704 --> 37:07.367
...in the creature, then, yes,
I believe we can successfully lure it.

37:08.175 --> 37:13.511
Whether we can survive the encounter
is the more intriguing question.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.751
Okay, we missing anything?

37:20.922 --> 37:23.482
- Can you carry these, son?
- Sure thing.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.650
Be careful.
You must be very gentle with them.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.625
Right, because we wouldn't wanna hurt
the monster babies.

37:30.731 --> 37:32.494
You need anything?

37:32.667 --> 37:36.034
Shot of JD and a chaser of beer
would be nice.

37:36.938 --> 37:40.066
You know, hunting this thing
in the sewers...

37:41.776 --> 37:43.539
...it's not a good idea, Liv.

37:44.278 --> 37:46.109
You got a better idea?

37:46.280 --> 37:47.577
Yeah.

37:47.748 --> 37:49.409
Don't get hurt for me.

37:49.650 --> 37:52.744
Well, that's not really very fair...

37:52.920 --> 37:56.151
...considering you would do
the same thing for me.

38:02.897 --> 38:05.092
I'll be back soon. Promise.

38:07.802 --> 38:10.362
You will call me
if his condition changes.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.267
I will.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.439
We ready?

38:14.608 --> 38:16.371
Ready as I'll ever be.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.310
- Walter, let's go.
- Be right there, son.

38:30.791 --> 38:35.194
Based on the sewer map,
this will make a fine infiltration point.

38:38.199 --> 38:39.632
Nothing to see here, ma'am.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.701
Just routine maintenance.

38:43.704 --> 38:45.899
Smells great down here.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.064
So, what's next, Walter?

38:48.242 --> 38:51.803
There's an intersection
a hundred feet down here.

38:51.979 --> 38:55.142
That will conduct the sound
most effectively.

39:09.830 --> 39:11.320
Nearly there.

39:23.544 --> 39:26.843
The larvae are creating a vibration.

39:27.014 --> 39:32.543
Frequencies of sound
detectable by bats...

39:34.321 --> 39:37.984
...and hopefully our guest of honor.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.690
Well, now I know what it feels like
to be live bait.

39:42.863 --> 39:45.388
Hey, come on, let's get in position.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.475
- Hello?
- You just get in?

40:02.817 --> 40:05.377
Hi. I thought it might be you.

40:05.553 --> 40:08.488
I just got in from the market.
I ran into Jody.

40:10.724 --> 40:12.351
What is it?

40:12.526 --> 40:15.723
Oh, she just told me
a really funny joke.

40:15.896 --> 40:18.023
- Tell me.
- So...

40:18.199 --> 40:20.724
...the patient goes to his doctor
and he says:

40:20.901 --> 40:24.337
"Doctor, if I give up wine, women
and song...

40:24.505 --> 40:26.803
...will I live longer?"

40:27.041 --> 40:30.499
And the doctor says, "Well, no...

40:30.678 --> 40:33.238
...but it'll feel longer."

40:39.120 --> 40:41.020
You don't think that's funny.

40:41.188 --> 40:43.315
- I do.
- No, you don't.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.355
Are you gonna be home for dinner?

40:46.427 --> 40:48.190
I don't know.

40:48.829 --> 40:51.764
Okay, all right, well, I will see you
when you get home.

40:51.932 --> 40:53.092
And I love you, babe.

40:53.267 --> 40:55.929
Even more for laughing at that joke.

40:56.103 --> 40:59.869
- I love you too.
- Bye-bye.

41:13.154 --> 41:17.454
Frightening situation like this,
two things occur to me.

41:18.726 --> 41:22.127
The first is a song
I used to sing to Rufus.

41:22.296 --> 41:23.320
Our dog.

41:23.497 --> 41:27.058
When he was young,
he used to have night terrors.

41:29.136 --> 41:31.229
Van Amburgh is the man

41:31.672 --> 41:34.140
Who goes to all the shows

41:34.308 --> 41:37.471
He steps into the lion's cage

41:37.645 --> 41:40.170
And tells them all he knows

41:40.381 --> 41:42.144
He puts his head in the lion's mouth

41:42.316 --> 41:43.408
Hey, Walter.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.917
You think we could wait down here
to be mauled in silence, please?

41:48.656 --> 41:51.750
- Of course.
- So, what was the second thing?

41:51.926 --> 41:55.259
- Hm?
- You said two things occurred to you.

41:56.163 --> 41:58.028
The second thing.

42:00.167 --> 42:01.634
I need to tinkle.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.162
Could either of you direct me
to the facilities?

42:05.339 --> 42:07.034
The facilities?

42:07.708 --> 42:09.335
You're in the sewer, Walter.

42:09.510 --> 42:12.843
- Your knee-deep in the facilities.
- Quite right.

42:14.815 --> 42:16.840
Excuse me.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.120
Don't say that I never
take you anywhere.

42:39.139 --> 42:41.232
Hey! Open this up right now.

42:41.442 --> 42:44.468
I'm afraid I can't do that.
No one else is going to get hurt.

42:44.645 --> 42:48.308
This thing is a mistake,
and I'm going to correct it. Alone.

42:49.083 --> 42:51.711
Walter! Hey, Walter,
you open this gate right now.

42:51.885 --> 42:53.352
You were right, Peter.

42:53.520 --> 42:57.547
I live in a society.
And I need to clean up after myself.

42:57.725 --> 43:00.353
Walter, this is not your fault.
You did not do this.

43:00.527 --> 43:03.189
No, but I could have.
I pursued the same science...

43:03.364 --> 43:06.356
You're not prepared for this,
that thing could tear you apart.

43:06.533 --> 43:08.330
Yes, you're right. I almost forgot.

43:09.036 --> 43:11.869
I've already considered
that possibility.

43:12.039 --> 43:14.439
Walter, is that the Trichloromide?
No, no, no!

43:14.608 --> 43:17.099
What are you doing?
That's gonna kill you.

43:18.545 --> 43:22.003
Should the creature consume me,
it will only be poisoning itself.

43:22.516 --> 43:26.509
Afterwards, you remove its blood
and save Agent Francis.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.247
Walter, listen to me,
I don't want you to do this.

43:29.423 --> 43:32.881
Okay? Do you hear what I'm saying?
I do not want you to do this.

43:33.093 --> 43:35.357
Should I live,
there's an antidote in the lab...

43:35.529 --> 43:38.965
...which I should ingest within the hour.
Time is of the essence.

43:39.133 --> 43:41.795
Walter, Walter, stop right there.

43:42.002 --> 43:44.869
Walter, come back here!
Stop right now!

43:45.072 --> 43:47.131
Walter!

43:52.046 --> 43:54.640
Van Amburgh is the man

43:54.815 --> 43:57.215
Who goes to all the shows

44:02.289 --> 44:04.780
Who goes to all the shows

44:04.958 --> 44:07.620
He steps right into the lion's cage

44:08.696 --> 44:10.493
Selfish son of a bitch.

44:10.664 --> 44:13.861
If he lives through this,
I am gonna kill him myself.

44:15.369 --> 44:18.463
The hyena in the next cage

44:18.639 --> 44:21.631
Most terrible to relate

44:22.876 --> 44:25.538
Got awfully hungry the other night

44:27.147 --> 44:29.138
And ate up his female mate

44:35.723 --> 44:38.590
He's a most ferocious beast

44:39.460 --> 44:42.657
Don't go near him, little boys

44:43.731 --> 44:47.030
For when he's mad he swings his tail

44:50.070 --> 44:51.731
And makes an awful noise

45:27.508 --> 45:29.032
Oh, dear God.

45:30.444 --> 45:31.775
Walter!

45:32.713 --> 45:33.873
Walter!

45:52.032 --> 45:53.727
Are you okay?

45:54.067 --> 45:55.830
Yes.

45:57.237 --> 45:59.262
Although when I mentioned...

45:59.440 --> 46:02.238
...that the poison
would kill me within the hour...

46:03.410 --> 46:06.675
...did either of you
happen to notice the time?

46:32.005 --> 46:33.472
That's it, then?

46:33.640 --> 46:35.699
Now we wait.

46:37.177 --> 46:40.203
Prepare Agent Francis
for the ultrasound.

46:44.852 --> 46:46.217
What?

46:46.386 --> 46:50.720
Sonia and I,
we've been talking a lot lately...

46:52.693 --> 46:54.285
...about having a baby.

46:54.495 --> 46:57.191
Sorry, I gotta jelly you up.

46:59.366 --> 47:01.197
You were right.

47:01.368 --> 47:05.498
What you said before
about the consequences.

47:05.672 --> 47:08.470
I don't think of them, never have.

47:09.009 --> 47:11.034
Don't know if I can.

47:11.211 --> 47:13.008
It's not who I am.

47:13.380 --> 47:15.143
I know.

47:15.816 --> 47:18.046
But you were brave today.

47:19.853 --> 47:21.184
Yeah.

47:23.390 --> 47:25.483
Check in on Agent Francis.

47:28.328 --> 47:31.161
Let's look in on our little friends.

47:41.208 --> 47:42.539
It didn't work.

47:43.243 --> 47:46.007
Ever the pessimist.

47:47.447 --> 47:49.176
Look.

47:53.186 --> 47:55.211
They're dying.

47:57.224 --> 47:59.590
What happens now?

48:00.360 --> 48:02.191
Now you crap them out.

48:14.942 --> 48:17.604
- Hey, you're home.
- Yeah.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.685
You feel good.

48:33.727 --> 48:36.594
- So do you.
- Mm-hm.
