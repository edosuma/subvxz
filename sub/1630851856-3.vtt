00:09.142 --> 00:10.677
-Oh yeah!
-Oh yeah!

00:12.000 --> 00:12.545
We really shouldn't be
doing this in my front drive.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.347
[moaning continues]

00:22.122 --> 00:23.223
[man finishes moaning]

00:24.657 --> 00:25.592
Great.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.696
[both groan]

00:30.000 --> 00:30.897
Look at that.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.400
Most girls don't have a rig
like yours when they're 40.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.002
Oh well, I'm 39,
but thanks.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.338
Trust me,
you're looking good.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.106
Okay.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.443
Yeah, oh yeah, you gotta get
the outside one. It's an old
car.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.545
Oh okay, thank you.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.582
-So, that's your bag.
-Oh thank you.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.455

01:06.000 --> 01:06.332
-[Matt] So, how'd you go?
-[Lauren] Hey.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.400
Good date?

01:07.467 --> 01:10.170
Oh yeah, well no,
he's a bit of a twat.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.138
Ah, well at least you're

01:12.205 --> 01:13.006
putting yourself out there

01:13.072 --> 01:13.973
trying to meet someone.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.209
Yeah, well that's not really

01:16.276 --> 01:17.444
what I'm trying to do but--

01:18.000 --> 01:19.412
Still, it's more
than I've done.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.548
Well, thank you
for baby-sitting.

01:21.614 --> 01:22.682
Nah, all good.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.451
It's the least I can do,

01:24.517 --> 01:26.486
considering you're taking care
of the divorce settlement

01:26.553 --> 01:27.587
for me and Tash.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.055
Yeah, and I might
have a quick shower,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.091
and then we can have a quick
rundown of your joint assets.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.193
-Yeah.
-Grab a beer.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.060
Okay, thanks.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.062
Oh I tried to get the
dishwasher going before

01:36.129 --> 01:37.931
but it wouldn't start. You
want me to have a look at it?

01:37.997 --> 01:39.699
Ah no, just leave it.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.167
[Matt] All good,
I'll have a squiz.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.735
[shower running]

01:42.802 --> 01:45.338
[Matt] Shit! Lauren!?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.775
What?

01:49.175 --> 01:50.844
I'm coming.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.246
[Matt] Lauren,
where's the water mains?

01:55.315 --> 01:56.783
[water gushing]

01:56.850 --> 01:57.750
Oh no!

02:00.000 --> 02:00.220
[Matt] Loz,
where's the water...

02:00.286 --> 02:01.454
Soft cock! Soft cock!

02:01.521 --> 02:02.322
[Matt] A what cock?

02:02.388 --> 02:03.156
Soft cock!

02:03.223 --> 02:04.224
I got it, I got it.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.926
Just... Ah sorry...

02:07.961 --> 02:08.862
Sorry!

02:09.229 --> 02:11.698
I thought I knew what
I was doing, but I didn't.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.734
At least I don't have to wash
the kitchen floor now.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.736
-Yeah.
-[Lauren sighs]

02:18.000 --> 02:19.239
That's a, nice towel.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.741
-Very wet.
-Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.051
Um, I'm handling
your divorce.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.454
-You are aren't you.
-Hmm.

02:37.056 --> 02:39.259
[upbeat music]

02:42.028 --> 02:44.163
[both moaning]

02:46.199 --> 02:47.634
Wow!

02:48.635 --> 02:50.336
I did not see that coming.

02:50.403 --> 02:51.304
[laughs]

02:52.405 --> 02:53.773
No, no.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.242
Are you okay?

02:56.309 --> 02:59.012
Sorry, ow, dead arm!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.314
Ah sorry.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.350
Well, that is one way
to get back on the horse.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.485
Are you calling
me a horse?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.154
No, metaphorically
you're a horse.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.422
You're not horsey.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.357
I am a bit horsey.
I am English.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.458
No you're not.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.596
Listen I, I don't want you
to think that this was

03:18.000 --> 03:18.698
just some kind
of wham bam...

03:19.265 --> 03:20.266
..thank you ma'am!

03:20.333 --> 03:22.101
Oh, yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.938
I don't want you to think
I'm some kind of player.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.941
No, I didn't
think that at all.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.678
Yeah. I mean obviously you
went out on a date tonight.

03:31.744 --> 03:32.879
Yeah, don't remind me.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.316
But, have you actually slept
with anyone since Jake or?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.551
-Since Jake?
-Hmm.

03:38.618 --> 03:39.586
Ahh...

03:39.652 --> 03:40.853
It's just I've
found it quite...

03:42.000 --> 03:44.357
I haven't had sex with anyone
since Tash and I split so...

03:44.424 --> 03:45.825
-Wow, okay.
-Yeah.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.293
-Okay.
-Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.195
-No not me.
-No, it's hard isn't it?

03:49.262 --> 03:50.863
Yeah it is hard, it's hard.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.900
-Being intimate.
-Being intimate and um...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.035
-Hmm.
-Vulnerable.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.505
-Vulnerable? It is, yeah.
-Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.975
It's so hard.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.647

04:40.446 --> 04:41.347
[Jake] Watch your back,
watch your back.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.849
[Nancy] Pop those
chickpeas in.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.550
Thank you.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.552
[Jake] There you are Angus.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.720
What?

04:48.000 --> 04:48.688
Hi!

04:48.755 --> 04:49.522
Angus, I see you've met.

04:49.589 --> 04:50.590
I wonder where
she'd gotten to.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.724
Ah, this is you.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.593
Yeah, well I thought I'd
get a, a pet for the girls.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.428
You know, teach them
some responsibilities.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.163
You thought you'd get them
this chicken for my place

04:57.230 --> 04:59.032
to teach them responsibility,

05:00.000 --> 05:00.133
and you called her Angus.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.267
Well I didn't buy her.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.669
She's actually
a rescue chicken.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.004
And, I don't know,
Angus is a really strong name.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.072
She'd feel empowered.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.073
[Nancy] My brother and his wife

05:07.140 --> 05:08.808
actually have a whole
coop in Brunswick.

05:08.875 --> 05:09.909
They make really good pets.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.411
[Jake] And I can't have
pets at my place,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.047
and Nancy's cat Fabian
probably wouldn't be too happy.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.114
No.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.916
It's good to think
about Fabian's needs,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.520
but I, who am not a cat,
have needs too, Jake,

05:20.586 --> 05:22.955
and what I do not
need is a chicken!

05:25.591 --> 05:26.726
Can you not shout around it?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.428
It's just probably
a bit traumatised.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.163
It's unlikely
to lay eggs again.

05:30.229 --> 05:31.097
Why are you here?

05:31.164 --> 05:31.998
[Jake] Well you told me

05:32.065 --> 05:33.332
to drop the girls off
to school today.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.734
Yes, I said drop the
girls off at school.

05:34.801 --> 05:35.802
Not come around to my house,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.070
let yourself in at seven
o'clock in the morning.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.338
Start making, what, a weeks
worth of bloody hummus.

05:39.405 --> 05:40.206
Oh, and by the way,

05:40.506 --> 05:41.808
don't suppose you can
bring me a fucking chicken!

05:42.000 --> 05:43.376
[Jake] All right! Okay!

05:43.443 --> 05:44.977
Can, can I take the chicken?

05:45.044 --> 05:46.179
Yes, take the chicken.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.080
[cooker dings]

05:48.000 --> 05:49.415
Oh, Jake's made his
famous pita bread.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.683
[children exclaim]

05:50.950 --> 05:53.820
-Yummy!
-Watch your back, it's hot.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.359
Wait, Ellia has to
sit in the front.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.961
She gets car sick at the back.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.496
You had her sitting
in the back with us.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.864
Right, well maybe
just for today,

06:04.931 --> 06:05.798
Ellia can sit in
the back with you.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.500
But she gets car sick.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.737
Well, so do I and I'm
a grown up real person.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.005
So can I sit in the front?
Thank you.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.508
It's okay Lola,
I can sit in the middle,

06:18.000 --> 06:18.311
and Ellia can sit by the
window to get some air.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.472
Have a good day, Angus.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.477
Hey, morning.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.946
Hi, is that a chicken?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.414
Yep. That is a chicken.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.983
Are we doing a spell?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.688
-[Alex] Crumbs, Lauren. Crumbs.
-[Phone Rings]

07:03.289 --> 07:05.191
Lauren Davies, Cook and Cook.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.025
[Nathan] Hi, it's Nathan.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.226
Nathan who? Sorry.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.327
[Nathan] It's Nathan Bolton.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.930
Dirty car sex! Dirty car sex!

07:12.000 --> 07:12.832
[Nathan] Hello? Sorry,
did you say dirty?

07:12.899 --> 07:14.934
-Sorry. That was my assistant.
-Associate!

07:15.001 --> 07:16.869
[Nathan] Hey listen,
can we grab a coffee?

07:18.000 --> 07:18.171
There's something I
need to talk to you about.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.139
Um, Yeah. Yeah. Why not?

07:20.206 --> 07:21.641
[Nathan] This morning?
It's kind of important.

07:24.000 --> 07:24.911
No, I can't do this morning.
Tomorrow?

07:24.977 --> 07:25.745
[Nathan] Yeah, okay.

07:25.812 --> 07:26.646
[phone chimes]

07:26.712 --> 07:28.648
Oh, hi Matt. Hi.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.350
[Matt] Hi. I'm at your office,
I've got you a coffee.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.185
Oh, thank you.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.152
We won't be long. Bye.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.687
[Alex] He got you a coffee?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.023
What surprising,
unwarranted attention.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.091
[upbeat music]

07:42.000 --> 07:45.131
-Hi, you look great.
-Aw, thank you.

07:45.198 --> 07:45.965
Oh, I love this.

07:46.032 --> 07:46.899
Thanks Tash.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.068
God, I wish I could
wear that colour.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.603
Oh, do you remember Alex?

07:50.670 --> 07:51.470
Yes, of course.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.005
At Lola's birthday?

07:54.000 --> 07:54.607
Yep. Yeah, absolutely.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.009
Oh, sorry.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.779
Well, no, you go. Great.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.216
Thanks again for doing this.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.317
We really appreciate it.

08:04.383 --> 08:05.184
No, honestly.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.221
Why make things more
complicated than they need to
be?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.392
Flat white. That's got
only half a sugar in it.

08:13.459 --> 08:14.493
Oh!

08:14.560 --> 08:16.696
Do you want half of this Tash?

08:16.762 --> 08:17.630
I don't need all of it.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.601
Yeah, I'll split it.
That's half there.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.202
That's a bit more than half.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.204
So um, you got the
settlement agreement,

08:25.271 --> 08:26.639
we'll just have a read through,

08:26.706 --> 08:27.874
see if you've got any
questions,

08:30.000 --> 08:30.276
and then we can,
we can all sign.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.522
[Simon] Hey, Lauren.
Someone's in reception for you.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.758
It's the Nathan Bolton.

08:45.825 --> 08:46.959
Oh.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.961
So thanks, Tash. Thanks.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.030
I'll see you, see you soon.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.369
-The Nathan Bolton?
-Yeah.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.005
So he's the highest scoring
soccer player of all time.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.840
Mate, just seriously.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.876
Everything you're doing in the
commentary area is fantastic,

09:03.943 --> 09:05.311
and all of your charity stuff.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.580
Don't suppose you're going to
release a pop song anytime
soon?

09:07.647 --> 09:08.481
Okay. No thanks.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.550
I'm going to get out of here.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.920
Lauren, I need to
have a quick word.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.221
Got time for a coffee?

09:18.000 --> 09:18.324
Yeah, I could do
with half a coffee.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.625
I'll just grab my things.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.696
[Lauren] Soccer is
different from AOL?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.899
AFL. That's Australian
Football League.

09:26.966 --> 09:27.900
That's not soccer.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.469
Thank you.

09:30.536 --> 09:34.340
So um, I've got
quite a hectic day.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.876
Right um,
so this is something

09:36.943 --> 09:38.945
you're probably not
going to want to hear.

09:39.011 --> 09:39.845
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:42.014
I got a message from someone,

09:42.081 --> 09:44.517
someone else I slept with
a while ago,

09:48.000 --> 09:48.120
telling me that
she has chlamydia.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.724
Please tell me that's
her daughter's name.

09:52.858 --> 09:53.759
No, Lauren.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.461
It's an STI.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.029
Yeah, that was a joke.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.598
See, the thing is,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.500
I don't know if I
definitely have it.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.736
And it'd be hard for me
to go to a doctor

10:06.000 --> 10:06.939
and get tested
because I'd get recognised.

10:07.006 --> 10:07.640
Right.

10:07.707 --> 10:08.507
'Cause I'm kind of...

10:08.574 --> 10:09.308
well known.
-Well known.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.911
Yeah. So you
haven't been tested.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.680
I was thinking
if you got tested,

10:14.747 --> 10:16.549
then I'd know for sure.

10:16.615 --> 10:17.416
Right.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.918
Because if she has it,
and so you do,

10:18.985 --> 10:20.486
then chances are I do too.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.420
Okay.

10:21.721 --> 10:22.621
So you want me to get tested
to work out whether or not

10:22.688 --> 10:23.456
you've got it.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.323
[Nathan] Yeah.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.257
Okay.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.559
Just trying to do
the right thing here.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.261
That does seem
incredibly moral of you.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.997
So, thank you.

10:31.063 --> 10:31.831
Yeah.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.399
It's not my fault.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.968
I just, I just love women.

10:37.503 --> 10:38.738
I'm a sex addict.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.172
Right. Yes.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.308
Well done.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.310
See the thing is,
I really can't get tested.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.312
Yes. Nathan,
just go to the doctor.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.813
I mean, what's the matter?

10:48.000 --> 10:48.714
The next thing you'll tell me--

10:48.781 --> 10:51.217
He's fucking married.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.719
I thought you were
doing background checks.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.754
Bloody hell, Alex.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.155
Well, I didn't
get around to it.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.190
He seemed too hot
to be actually married.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.459
Maybe it's an open marriage.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.528
I've had sex with a married,
famous football player.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.429
Soccer, soccer player.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.463
Whatever. Married. Famous.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.465
Who's possibly given
me chlamydia.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.901
Where's the due diligence,
Alex?

11:08.968 --> 11:10.803
I'd happily get chlamydia
from Nathan Bolton.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.539
I'd get leprosy
from Nathan Bolton.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.542
Oh well,
look on the bright side.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.710
What bright side?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.413
Maybe a whack of antibiotics
will clear up that UTI?

11:20.479 --> 11:22.248
I don't have a UTI, Alex.

11:22.314 --> 11:23.082
Really?

11:24.000 --> 11:24.784
No, but if I do have chlamydia,

11:24.850 --> 11:27.286
then I've got to tell
everyone I've slept with too.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.655
Luckily you have me,
we have the spreadsheet.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.223
Okay.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.426
What do I have to do to
test for chlamydia, anyway?

11:33.492 --> 11:35.428
It's super easy. It's just
a little wee-wee test.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.862
Okay.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.998
And a scrape of the cervix.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.001
[Helena] Chlamydia?

11:42.068 --> 11:44.703
Shh. Okay. No need to shout.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.971
Keep your voice down.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.040
Christ Lauren,
you've got the clap.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.208
No, I haven't got the clap.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.109
That's gonorrhoea.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.310
-Have you got that, too?
-[Lauren] No.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.211
Are you sure?

11:52.278 --> 11:53.079
I don't have chlamydia.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.313
I haven't got the
results back yet.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.882
And we did. We did.
We did use a condom.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.419
Oh, you've definitely got it.
Oof chlamydia. Hang on.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.855
What do you want Rosa,
Cheerios?

12:02.922 --> 12:05.591
Look, my friend at work got
it, and she used a condom.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.094
So, yeah, you've probably.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.328
Oh Lord.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.330
How's it feel then to be
a dirty trollop, I mean?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.365
Well, I don't know
if it's psychosomatic,

12:13.432 --> 12:14.834
but I'm itching like crazy.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.869
[Carol] Why are you itchy,
darling?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.004
[Helena] Good morning Mum,
hi Dad.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.340
[Lauren] Oh, hi Mum, hi.
Hello Dad.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.575
[Roger] Isn't this nice,
all together.

12:22.641 --> 12:23.809
Yes, lovely. I didn't
realise...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.412
Sorry, what's that? Your
father was talking over you.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.814
No, I wasn't.
She wasn't talking.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.416
What time is it
over there, boss?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.152
I don't know the
exact time, it's dark.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.153
Darling, you don't have

12:36.000 --> 12:36.122
that terrible yeast
infection again, do you?

12:36.188 --> 12:38.190
No Mum, I don't have
a yeast infection.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.325
I've never had a--

12:39.391 --> 12:41.494
Well, you do look tired.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.162
Thank you, I appreciate that.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.364
[Helena] Yeah,
you do look tired.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.665
Okay. Bye.

12:49.535 --> 12:50.703
I don't have chlamydia.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.206
[upbeat music]

13:00.000 --> 13:00.646
Hi Mum, just need to poo.
How are you?

13:00.713 --> 13:03.949
Hi baby, I'm just in
the shower. Won't be a sec.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.919
[yells] Stop Abby,
I'm in the shower!

13:06.986 --> 13:07.820
Sorry.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.257
Mum. Can I have caviar
for lunch today?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.959
How do you even know
what caviar is?

13:14.026 --> 13:15.294
Nan gave it to her
at Christmas.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.062
[Lauren] She did?

13:18.030 --> 13:20.499
So can I have it for lunch?

13:20.566 --> 13:23.836
No, surprisingly, I don't
have any caviar. So, no.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.738
But Marcus asked for caviar.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.873
He said he wouldn't
be my friend anymore

13:27.940 --> 13:29.241
if I don't give him caviar.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.309
Who's Marcus?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.311
Chloe and Amanda too.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.614
Nancy's made a weeks worth
of quite dry and lumpy hummus.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.950
So we'll be
having that, instead.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.586
I'm done.
I need some toilet paper.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.656
Okay, Abby, can you
get some toilet paper?

13:43.722 --> 13:46.292
[phone chimes]

13:50.563 --> 13:52.598
Mum, toilet paper!

13:54.000 --> 13:54.500
[yells] Abby!

14:00.000 --> 14:00.105
Okey-doke.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.707
Come on, let's keep
those legs together,

14:01.774 --> 14:03.742
we don't know if
this thing's airborne.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.644
Here we go.
Patient zero, Nathan Bolton.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.613
And this is who we have
to get back to, yeah?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.415
So I've organised by date.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.083
And if we work backwards
from your latest hook-up,

14:11.150 --> 14:11.984
all we need to do

14:12.251 --> 14:13.819
is pop them into the
anonymous group message, here.

14:13.886 --> 14:14.687
Group message.

14:14.753 --> 14:15.888
Anonymous. It's a 'burner'.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.256
Are we in an episode
of The Wire?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.024
You know,
I couldn't get into it.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.093
Just stick with it.
You get used to the language.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.963
Okay, so, here we go.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.965
Guido, foreign firemen,
10 inches.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.900
Oh my god, I forgot about him.
The crier.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.602
Craig, stoned kick-boxer.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.338
Oh, I blocked him too. This
is actually quite confronting.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.373
Yeah. Well, I mean, this is
only the last two weeks.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.407
Remember Sir Cumalot?

14:36.000 --> 14:36.709
Oh god, no, please.

14:36.775 --> 14:39.178
Ian, quantity surveyor.
Nimesh, the barista.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.447
Trevor, barista.
Spiro, barista.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.381
Barrister.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.183
Okay, I knew that,
that was just a typo.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.217
Bazza, furniture importer.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.151
Okay.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.753
And Wayne the busker,
with the trumpet.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.455
Oh yes I remember.
Yeah. Yeah.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.490
And that brings us
back to the 23rd.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.126
The date you shagged the famous
married sports commentator

14:54.193 --> 14:55.561
in the front seat
of his sports car.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.463
Yes, I had quite crammed
sex with Nathan and then...

14:57.529 --> 14:58.397
Umm!

15:00.000 --> 15:00.599
What?

15:01.033 --> 15:02.067
Matt!

15:06.000 --> 15:06.405
I knew it. I knew it.
"I got you a coffee".

15:06.472 --> 15:09.074
Seemed unusually nice
for a straight man.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.510
Yeah. And I told him I hadn't
slept with anyone since Jake.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.878
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck!

15:14.280 --> 15:17.950
[gentle music]
[chicken clucks]

15:20.786 --> 15:22.354
A lady told me
to give you this.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.522
What lady?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.791
The one at school
who gives me food.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.860
I can't read it.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.163
Oh crikey Lola,
it's a bill for $120.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.299
You've ordered
canteen lunches all week.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.001
Yes, because Marcus
didn't like my lunch.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.270
He asked for caviar, remember?

15:38.337 --> 15:40.472
Is Marcus in your class?

15:42.000 --> 15:42.841
No. Anyway, it's not just him.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.044
It's Chloe and Amanda
and Isabel and

15:45.110 --> 15:47.413
Applesauce and Rocket,
as well.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.683
Hang on, are these friends
like Ellia is your friend?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.284
Yeah, they're friends
with Ellia, too.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.520
And they told you to
throw away your lunch?

15:54.586 --> 15:58.791
They don't like Nancy's hummus.
Well, they did use to.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.194
But then Nancy said Ellia
couldn't sit in the front

16:06.000 --> 16:06.298
of Daddy's car
and she gets car sick.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.867
Maybe Nancy didn't realise.

16:10.002 --> 16:10.936
You should always
tell the truth.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.605
I know it's hard sometimes,
but it's important. Okay?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.979
Why don't we have a tea party
tomorrow for all your friends?

16:24.000 --> 16:24.416
And we can have Dad
and Nancy over too, yeah?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.584
Can we have caviar?

16:26.585 --> 16:28.554
I thought I might bake.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.589
They really like caviar.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.824
I might bake as well.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.495
If you have to. But use
real vanilla beans, okay?

16:36.562 --> 16:37.429
Okay.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.567
Takies.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.470
Okay, so I've sent
the group message.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.671
All you need to
do is call Matt.

16:45.738 --> 16:46.572
Hm-hm.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.608
Like right now.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.711
Can I have one of your
beta blockers please?

16:52.778 --> 16:53.946
Absolutely not. Chop, chop.

16:54.980 --> 16:55.981
Ah,

16:56.949 --> 16:57.783
okay, Matt.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.285
Call.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.086
Speaker.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.855
[phone ringing]

17:06.000 --> 17:07.893
[Matt] Hi, listen can I just,
I'm just--

17:07.960 --> 17:09.528
Hi Matt, hi. Sorry to bother
you.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.897
I need to talk to you about
something.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.234
Okay, it's just,
I'm actually on a date.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.302
Can I call you tomorrow?
Sorry.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.337
Oh, oh no.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.038
Hang on. Oh, bye.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.808
He's on a date.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.609
Yep.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.810
He's going to call me tomorrow.

17:24.877 --> 17:25.778
No, I did hear that.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.146
It was on speakerphone.
Okay. Well, okay.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.415
You have to call him tomorrow
and that's the end of it.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.016
But that, that's not
the end of it.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.551
Thanks to me,
he's back on a horse.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.819
What if he sleeps with her?

17:33.886 --> 17:34.820
He'll wear a condom.
He's an adult.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.988
It doesn't matter.
Nathan did.

17:36.054 --> 17:39.024
It's, it's all about juices
and membranes and things.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.460
Okay. Yeah, okay,
call him back.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.632
[Matt] Hey, you've called Matt.

17:46.698 --> 17:47.900
Oh, it's voicemail.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.668
Leave a message, what are
you doing? Leave a message.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.070
Hi Matt. It's Lauren Davies.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.739
We spoke earlier.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.207
I'm just calling.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.609
I know you're on a date.
It's actually about said date.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.913
If you could get back to me
ASAP, that would be fantastic.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.114
Thank you.
Thanks for your time.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.348
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.318
Beautiful, Lauren Davies.
Very professional.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.152
Let's just hope he calls back.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.455
Otherwise you'll have to add
super spreader to your resume,

18:09.521 --> 18:11.123
and a family law expert.
Cheers.

[knock on door]

18:18.000 --> 18:20.232
Abby, can you get the door?

18:24.000 --> 18:24.670
Hey.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.805
Oh hey.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.441
I didn't know you baked.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.544
Someone's birthday or
you're just practising?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.416
No, we're having a tea party,
but they didn't go quite--

18:37.483 --> 18:39.284
I thought I should come
and see you in person.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.286
I got your voicemails. Seven.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.855
Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.190
Yeah, no, yeah,
no it's, I'm sorry.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.960
I didn't mean to
intrude on your date.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.294
No no, I should have
spoken to you.

18:49.361 --> 18:53.365
I've been meaning to
speak to you about us.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.700
Right.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.034
Yeah.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.804
But I got the impression
that you weren't as keen.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.108
No. Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's just...

19:03.175 --> 19:04.676
Just?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.179
I'm really happy
you went on a date.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.113
Right.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.149
Yeah. Just your voicemails.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.017
You said.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.820
Did you sleep with her?

19:15.854 --> 19:17.789
Did you have sex on your date?

19:18.857 --> 19:20.559
Sorry. You just said

19:20.626 --> 19:23.362
that you were happy
that I went on a date.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.332
I've got chlamydia.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.269
You've got?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.103
I've got chlamydia.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.037
What? When?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.273
Yeah, I apologise.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.110
You told me that I was
the first one since Jake.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.144
Yeah, I lied.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.012
Did you?

19:40.212 --> 19:41.280
Because you said you
hadn't slept with anyone

19:42.000 --> 19:43.582
and I didn't want you
to feel pathetic.

19:43.649 --> 19:44.449
Cheers for that.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.285
I only just found out and
I really don't want to be

19:46.351 --> 19:47.119
a super spreader.

19:47.185 --> 19:47.986
Super spreader. Wow.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.222
You really are sleeping
with a lot of people.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.623
Look, I didn't
sleep with my date--

19:51.690 --> 19:52.624
[Jake] Matty!

19:54.000 --> 19:54.259
Hey man,
how are you going bro?

19:54.326 --> 19:55.694
I didn't know you were coming.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.829
Good to see ya.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.264
-Hey Loz.
-Hey.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.599
Do you want a beer?

20:00.666 --> 20:01.900
No, I've got to...

20:01.967 --> 20:02.834
Did you see the game last
night?

20:02.901 --> 20:04.036
No, it was a good game though?

20:04.102 --> 20:05.437
-It was awesome.
-Yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.905
How've you been? I haven't
seen you in yonks bro.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.206
Ah Yonkytonks.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.174
[laughs] Yonkytonks.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.844
Hi, I was just trying
out a new tray.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.180
Oh, well, sorry.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.915
I just know not everyone
loves to bake,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.152
so I just whipped
these out, luckily.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.654
Yeah. Put them here.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.590
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.593
[upbeat music]

20:31.663 --> 20:33.265
[cuckoo cuckoo]

20:36.000 --> 20:37.069
So good.
Will he come out again?

20:37.135 --> 20:38.170
Yeah, every hour.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.572
It's so much fun.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.842
Matt, you sit there.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.346
Yeah. Good. Okay.
This is great.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.182
How's it going out there, bro?

20:51.783 --> 20:53.185
Where, outside?

20:54.286 --> 20:57.356
Out there, you know, are you
back on the horse again? Or?

21:00.000 --> 21:00.158
Oh yeah, yeah.
No, a bit. Not really.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.828
Matt, you've got
to get out there.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.966
Maybe not totally out there,
[laughs] but, out there!

21:08.634 --> 21:09.735
Caviar, Nancy?

21:10.235 --> 21:11.770
Oh no. Thank you.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.773
Wow. We're feeding them
caviar now, are we?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.341
It's Marcus's favourite.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.411
And it's lumpfish eggs,
not bloody beluga!

21:19.911 --> 21:22.247
So Lola, is this
Ellia sitting here?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.551
Yeah. Ellia. You know,
who gets car sick.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.187
And that's Lipstick.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.189
-Lipstick!
-Lipstick?

21:31.256 --> 21:35.927
Yeah. She's 39 and her
favourite things are wine and
chlamydia.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.162
[bottle clanks on table]

21:37.229 --> 21:38.730
-Shit, sorry.
-Wow!

21:42.467 --> 21:45.737
-Do you have anything
absorbent? -Yeah, I'll get
something.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.709
[upbeat music]

21:52.678 --> 21:53.645
Excellent.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.748
Now I've got lots of caviar
to go with all the hummus.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.684
That'll keep us in
lunches for a while.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.951
Mm, yummy.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.019
Oh, Hey.

22:01.086 --> 22:01.887
I've been meaning to ask you.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.056
Have you seen my swimming
pool membership card?

22:04.122 --> 22:04.856
No.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.925
[phone chimes]

22:08.794 --> 22:10.328
[Jake] Oh shit.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.698
Ah, there's nits again
in Lola's class.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.569
Honey, we should take off.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.604
We've got, we've got
the thing. So we better.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.173
Did you want that last one?

22:21.239 --> 22:22.274
[Jake] Bye girls.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.675
-You do?
-Yes, thank you.

22:24.242 --> 22:27.045
Loz, just keep
an eye out, okay?

22:27.112 --> 22:27.979
Yep, okay.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.757
I think Angus has nits, too.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.893
Nah, chickens can't get nits.
She probably has fleas.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.695
Brilliant.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.197

23:00.000 --> 23:00.178
Much older? Not much.
I'm older, not, much...

[phone chimes]

23:04.483 --> 23:05.517
Matt, hi.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.487
Oh hey, I was just going
to leave a message.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.955
Well, I'm here. Hi.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.157
Yeah I just wanted to apologise

23:12.224 --> 23:14.593
for spilling beer
all over the tea party.

23:14.659 --> 23:16.294
No, don't worry.
It was fine.

23:18.000 --> 23:18.263
Honestly, especially
considering the--

23:18.330 --> 23:22.200
Nah, it's all right. I've had
the treatment so it's all good.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.468
-Good.
-Easy peasy.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.371
Great. There was one
other thing um...

23:27.506 --> 23:29.107
Ah, I don't suppose you
have an itchy head?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.443
-What?
-No, you don't!

23:31.510 --> 23:33.145
-No!
-Great.

23:33.211 --> 23:34.479
-What?
-Bye.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.781
Bye.

Ah, good.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.925
