00:53.264 --> 00:55.432
No son, never.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.269
The blood stays
on the blade.

01:01.780 --> 01:02.910
One day you'll understand.

01:13.751 --> 01:14.751
Some of it I have remembered.

01:16.051 --> 01:20.221
And the rest I
took from dreams.

01:24.971 --> 01:27.521
St. Michael the Archangel
defend us in battle.

01:28.431 --> 01:29.811
Be our protector.

01:31.401 --> 01:35.401
Against the snares. And
the wickedness of the devil.

01:37.241 --> 01:38.571
Now son, who's that?

01:39.111 --> 01:39.991
St. Michael.

01:39.991 --> 01:40.531
Who is it?

01:40.821 --> 01:41.661
St. Michael.

01:42.241 --> 01:42.821
And what did he do?

01:43.121 --> 01:44.832
He cast Satan out
of Paradse.

01:46.242 --> 01:46.872
Good boy!

03:32.235 --> 03:33.065
Johnny!

03:34.275 --> 03:35.105
What's the battle?

03:35.525 --> 03:37.155
Natives against the
Dead Rabbits.

03:37.235 --> 03:37.815
Which are you?

03:38.405 --> 03:39.945
What do you think?
Dead Rabbits!

04:21.156 --> 04:21.986
Well,well, Monk!

04:23.696 --> 04:25.036
Are you with us
or not?

04:25.746 --> 04:27.746
For the last time Vallon,
only if the money is right.

04:29.706 --> 04:31.586
I'll give you 10 per notch.

04:33.296 --> 04:34.207
10?

04:34.757 --> 04:35.337
You have my word.

04:41.137 --> 04:43.637
10 per notch. Per new notch.

04:48.347 --> 04:48.937
Then I'm your man.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.420
Is this it, Priest?
The Pope's new army?

06:42.180 --> 06:44.800
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags!

06:45.470 --> 06:48.890
I know Bill. You swore, this was
a battle between warriors.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.811
Not a bunch of Miss Nancy's.

06:51.891 --> 06:53.601
So warriors is what I brought.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.821
The O'Connell Guard!

06:59.321 --> 07:00.231
The Plug Uglies!

07:00.901 --> 07:01.901
The Shirt Tails!

07:08.371 --> 07:09.541
The Chichesters!

07:10.081 --> 07:11.501
The Forty Thieves!

07:22.221 --> 07:22.921
Bene.

07:29.102 --> 07:34.352
On my challenge, by the ancient
laws of combat...

07:34.562 --> 07:37.232
...we are met at
this chosen ground...

07:37.692 --> 07:39.572
...to settle for good and all...

07:40.532 --> 07:42.782
...who holds sway,
over the Five Points.

07:44.822 --> 07:49.832
Us Natives, born rightwise
to this fine land....

07:50.832 --> 07:53.162
...or the foreign hordes
defiling it!

07:58.132 --> 08:02.423
Under the ancient laws of combat
I accept the challenge of the so called Natives.

08:03.423 --> 08:05.263
You plague our people at
every turn!

08:06.013 --> 08:08.433
But from this day out, you
shall plague us no more!

08:08.973 --> 08:12.183
Let it be known, that the hand
that tries to strike us from this land...

08:12.723 --> 08:14.143
...shall be swiflty cut down!

08:16.893 --> 08:22.483
Then may the Christian Lord, guide
my hand, against your Roman popery!

08:22.903 --> 08:24.783
Prepare to receive
the true Lord!

10:28.747 --> 10:29.197
Priest!

11:18.748 --> 11:19.458
Look at me!

11:22.468 --> 11:24.049
Who is this under my knife?

11:33.479 --> 11:34.809
Father, get up! Get up!

11:36.349 --> 11:36.849
Where are you?

11:38.109 --> 11:38.519
Where are you?

11:41.399 --> 11:42.069
No, my son.

11:45.989 --> 11:48.239
Don't never look away!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.130
Soon be over, Priest.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.010
Finish it!

12:21.690 --> 12:23.320
You may need this to cross
the river.

12:33.411 --> 12:35.751
Ears and noses will be the
trophies of the day.

12:37.751 --> 12:40.131
But no hand shall touch him!

12:43.591 --> 12:45.011
No hand shall touch him!

12:48.471 --> 12:49.931
He'll cross over whole!

12:51.891 --> 12:52.511
In honour!

12:54.021 --> 12:55.431
Not before I get what's owed!

13:03.321 --> 13:03.781
No!

13:06.492 --> 13:09.492
It's fair. A touch indelicate,
but fair.

13:15.502 --> 13:16.122
My sympathies.

13:18.212 --> 13:19.212
What shall we do with
the boy?

13:20.382 --> 13:21.042
Look at me.

13:28.222 --> 13:29.092
Give him to the law.

13:30.222 --> 13:31.802
See he gets a good
education.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.102
Okay, boss. Say goodbye
to your father.

13:39.102 --> 13:39.943
Hey. Take it easy!

13:48.243 --> 13:49.533
Hurry! Come in here!

14:11.383 --> 14:13.724
Come here, boy. You're
going to Hell's Gate!

14:14.144 --> 14:14.684
There he is!

14:15.014 --> 14:15.304
Get him!

14:15.394 --> 14:17.894
Priest Vallon died a
noble death.

14:18.734 --> 14:23.024
But his Dead Rabbits is done
and outlawed.

14:25.734 --> 14:29.194
Let no one even speak their
name from now on.

15:15.665 --> 15:20.545
In this place, you've
grown from a boy into a man.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.926
Put to death the earthly
things in you.

15:23.966 --> 15:28.676
Immorality. Impurity.
Passion. Vengeance.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.676
The Lord has forgiven you.

15:33.136 --> 15:35.226
You also must forgive.

15:37.266 --> 15:41.476
You go forth to a country torn
apart by civil strife.

15:41.856 --> 15:42.936
Thank you, Reverend.

15:47.236 --> 15:50.076
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.156
That this war may end.

15:52.446 --> 15:56.707
And the plague of slavery,
that brought this confergration down upon us  ...

15:57.537 --> 16:00.997
...vanish forever
from the earth.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.408
In the second year of the
great civil war...

16:34.038 --> 16:36.498
...when the irish brigades
marched through the streets...

16:37.118 --> 16:39.708
...New york was a city
full of tribes.

16:40.128 --> 16:43.298
War chiefs. Rich and poor.

16:45.758 --> 16:48.218
Lincoln will make all
white men slaves!

16:48.298 --> 16:49.638
It wasn't a city really.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.758
It was more a furnace.

16:52.308 --> 16:55.308
Where cities someday
might be forged.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.058
That's the spirit boys.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.058
Go off and die for your
blackie friends.

17:01.768 --> 17:04.819
We should have run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

17:06.819 --> 17:09.358
They are trying to say ,we
are no different than niggers.

17:09.909 --> 17:10.909
You ain't.

17:15.499 --> 17:17.789
Go back to Africa,
niggers!

17:21.499 --> 17:24.669
The angriest talk was of
the new conscription act.

17:25.249 --> 17:28.219
The first draft in Union
history.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.940
Join the army lads. Three square
meals a day and good pay.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.990
When the Irish came, the city was
in a fever.

17:47.570 --> 17:51.410
Since the time of the great famine
they'd come streaming off the boats.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.240
And they got a right warm welcome.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.120
Go back to Ireland, you
dumb Mick!

17:56.240 --> 17:57.870
You'll remember that!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.460
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

18:00.290 --> 18:03.130
I came only 2 hours down
river from Hell Gate...

18:03.790 --> 18:05.710
..but they all took me
for an immigrant.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.010
Why not?

18:07.590 --> 18:10.090
There were a 1000 different
accents in New York..

18:10.130 --> 18:13.301
..and to the Natives you see,
they were all the same.

18:15.431 --> 18:18.601
Come here to take the chill off
your soul and the weight off your heart.

18:19.481 --> 18:22.851
Welcome to America son, your long
arduous journey is over.

18:23.151 --> 18:24.401
Go back to your own country.

18:24.441 --> 18:25.571
Vote Tammany!

18:26.021 --> 18:27.731
America for Americans!

18:33.491 --> 18:37.041
New York loved William
Tweed and hated him.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.041
And those of us trying
to be thieves....

18:40.041 --> 18:41.581
...we couldn't help but
admire him.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.581
Mr. Cutting. Gentlemen.

18:44.001 --> 18:45.631
Thank you for coming.
It's an honour.

18:45.712 --> 18:46.752
Mr. Tweed?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.882
Sir! Please! Excuse me?

18:52.472 --> 18:53.592
I think your're frightening
them.

18:54.012 --> 18:54.472
So?

18:54.932 --> 18:57.062
Don't mind him, he used to
be an Irishman.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.732
The Five Points!

19:02.062 --> 19:04.902
Murderer's Alley. Brickbat Mansion.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.072
The Gates of hell!

19:08.192 --> 19:09.532
In this wild place....

19:10.032 --> 19:13.072
Look upon the face of this
poor child.

19:13.492 --> 19:20.373
She lives in squalor, in this
godforsaken den of vice and
misery behind me.

19:21.043 --> 19:23.123
Every year the Reformers came.

19:23.543 --> 19:25.673
Every year the Points got
worse.

19:27.043 --> 19:28.253
As if it liked being dirty.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.763
Where am I going to go?

19:31.803 --> 19:32.223
Move.

19:32.223 --> 19:33.553
The Reverend wants you out
of here.

19:47.863 --> 19:51.573
You may or not know Bill, that every
day I go down to the waterfront...

19:51.653 --> 19:53.994
...with hot soup for the Irish
as they come on shore.

19:54.404 --> 19:56.114
As part of building a political
base.

19:56.954 --> 19:58.124
I've noticed you there.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.834
You may have noticed me?

19:59.874 --> 20:00.834
Indeed I have!

20:00.834 --> 20:05.004
Throwing torrents of favours and
withering abuse on every person who
step off those boats.

20:05.254 --> 20:06.964
If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed...

20:07.004 --> 20:10.384
...I'd shoot each and everyone of them,
before they set foot on American soil.

20:37.495 --> 20:46.625
Mulbeery street and Worth. Cross.
Orange and Littlewater.

20:47.425 --> 20:49.465
Each of the Five Points is a
finger...

20:50.595 --> 20:53.885
...when I close my hand
it becomes a fist.

20:55.055 --> 20:59.345
And any time that I wish, I
can turn it against you.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.605
I understand. But we're talking
about different things.

21:01.605 --> 21:05.356
I'm talking about civic duty.
Responsibilites we owe to the people.

21:05.356 --> 21:08.446
Schools and hospitals. Sewers
and utilities.

21:08.486 --> 21:12.736
Street construction, repairs and
sweeping. Business and saloon licences...

21:34.386 --> 21:36.267
St. Michael the Archangel...

21:37.097 --> 21:38.477
Defend us in battle.

21:38.977 --> 21:42.517
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

21:43.107 --> 21:45.817
Streetcars, ferries,
rubbish disposal.

21:45.937 --> 21:48.487
There's a power of money to
be made in this city, Bill.

21:48.697 --> 21:52.527
With your help, the people must
be made to understand...

21:52.567 --> 21:57.367
...that all these things are best
kept, in what I like to call the
Tammany family.

21:57.407 --> 22:01.417
That is why I am talking about
an alliance between our organisations.

22:02.077 --> 22:04.167
You're talking about muscle
work.

22:04.247 --> 22:06.547
That too. Muscle to match
our spirit.

22:06.837 --> 22:08.717
You own the crushers, get
them to do it.

22:08.837 --> 22:10.378
The police? Oh, no! Jezus,no!

22:11.088 --> 22:14.008
The appearance of the law must
be upheld.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.808
Especially while it's been
broken.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.448
Give me the strength, for what I
must do.

22:35.028 --> 22:35.868
Who are you?

22:41.458 --> 22:44.038
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

22:52.629 --> 22:54.469
I just like it down here
is all.

22:56.349 --> 22:58.179
See what's in his pockets,
Jimmy.

22:58.929 --> 23:01.229
Now look, boys. I really don't
want to fight.

23:00.929 --> 23:02.349
You don't want to fight?

23:02.769 --> 23:04.599
Don't worry, son. Ain't gonna
be much of a fight.

23:12.819 --> 23:13.909
Don't kill me.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.170
Where did you get that?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.830
I told you I didn't want
to fight!

23:27.670 --> 23:28.670
Why not?

23:28.960 --> 23:30.510
Look how good you done.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.100
You're the priest's son
aren't you?

23:39.560 --> 23:41.770
You! Get away from me.
You understand?

23:42.850 --> 23:43.810
You don't remember me, do you?

23:44.810 --> 23:46.400
I was the one tried to help
you.

23:49.110 --> 23:50.070
What?

23:50.570 --> 23:52.241
I was the one tried to help
you.

23:52.281 --> 23:53.531
When the Natives took you.

23:58.531 --> 23:58.951
That was you?

23:59.411 --> 24:01.871
Yeah. I thought you was killed.

24:05.961 --> 24:07.711
They just locked me up
You know that.

24:07.961 --> 24:08.961
This long?

24:09.711 --> 24:12.171
I kept trying to escape, you know.

24:12.961 --> 24:14.261
Did more time for that.

24:16.381 --> 24:17.721
So what are you doing back
here?

24:19.551 --> 24:21.011
Guess I missed the place.

24:28.562 --> 24:29.562
Bowery boys.

24:44.042 --> 24:46.462
The Five Points.
Paradise square!

24:47.292 --> 24:49.332
The streets here are always
livelier in the evening.

24:51.292 --> 24:52.592
Who are the gangs around now?

24:53.002 --> 24:55.212
We got the Daybreak boys
and the Swamp Angels.

24:55.302 --> 24:56.762
They work the River
Luton ships.

24:57.182 --> 25:00.142
The Frog Haulers shanghai sailors
down around the bay.

25:00.353 --> 25:04.183
Shortails were rough for awhile,
but they became a bunch of jackrolling
dandies.

25:04.183 --> 25:06.733
Lolling around Murderer's Alley
looking like Chinamen.

25:07.063 --> 25:09.523
Hellcat Maggie she tried to open
up her own grog shop.

25:09.733 --> 25:12.823
But she drunk up all her own
liquor and got thrown out
on the street.

25:13.523 --> 25:14.903
Now she's on the lay
for everything.

25:15.613 --> 25:17.903
The Plug Uglies they're from
somewhere in the old country.

25:18.323 --> 25:19.033
They got their own language.

25:19.453 --> 25:20.373
No one understands what they're
saying.

25:20.783 --> 25:21.913
They love to fight the cops.

25:22.493 --> 25:24.623
And the Nightwalkers and Ratpickers.

25:24.793 --> 25:26.793
They work on their backs and
kill with their hands.

25:27.463 --> 25:28.833
They're so scurvy, only the
Plug Uglies...

25:28.833 --> 25:29.623
...will talk with them.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.173
But who knows what they're
saying.

25:31.543 --> 25:35.924
The Slaughterhouses and the
Broadway Twisters are a fine
bunch of Bengal boys!

25:35.924 --> 25:37.264
And the little  Forty Thieves.

25:37.264 --> 25:38.844
I used to run with them
for a while.

25:38.844 --> 25:41.804
Till they got taken over by
Benjer the Cockroach and his red
eyed buggers.

25:41.934 --> 25:43.054
Benjer is a germ.

25:43.764 --> 25:44.644
If you try to leave the
gang, they say...

25:44.644 --> 25:45.854
...he hacks the blood off you.

25:46.854 --> 25:49.984
The righteousness are nothing but
a bunch of repetitious grab ups..

25:51.104 --> 25:53.154
The True Blue Americans call
themselves a gang...

25:53.154 --> 25:56.364
...but all they really do is stand
around on corners damning Engeland.

25:56.694 --> 25:59.114
Do you believe one word that
the British say...?

25:59.864 --> 26:02.124
Anything about the sand of
the Dead Rabbits?

26:06.874 --> 26:08.084
You don't say that name!

26:09.125 --> 26:10.375
That name died with your...

26:11.545 --> 26:12.545
It's been outlawed.

26:14.425 --> 26:16.135
When I was in the blockhouse,
the chinks told me...

26:16.135 --> 26:17.845
...that the Natives celebrate
their victory...

26:17.845 --> 26:19.015
....every year.

26:19.725 --> 26:20.725
Is that true?

26:21.305 --> 26:22.435
Aye, that they do.

26:22.845 --> 26:23.805
It's quite a fair.

26:24.145 --> 26:25.565
The Butcher himself has got
to invite you...

26:25.565 --> 26:26.435
...or you don't go.

26:37.615 --> 26:39.115
Look where you are going, Johnny!

26:43.286 --> 26:44.826
You look stunned and
poorly, sir!

26:50.126 --> 26:52.336
Quite a pair of conversationists
aren't you!

26:55.886 --> 26:58.176
Maybe not. We're deep
thinkers.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.896
Gentlemen, I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord!

27:16.026 --> 27:18.527
Jenny, finest bludget in all
the Points.

27:19.077 --> 27:21.327
She is a prim looking
star gazer!

27:23.917 --> 27:25.747
But I'd check my pockets
if I were you.

27:26.627 --> 27:28.837
Because I do believe she lifted
your time piece.

27:33.627 --> 27:35.047
I let her take it.

27:36.467 --> 27:37.967
I let here take things all
the time.

27:39.757 --> 27:40.137
Is that right?

27:40.387 --> 27:40.927
Yeah.

27:46.687 --> 27:49.107
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

27:50.397 --> 27:52.988
You generally pick up a swag
and if the cops came along...

27:52.988 --> 27:55.108
...you really got a show.

27:56.158 --> 27:58.828
The municipal police fought
the metropolitan police.

27:59.948 --> 28:02.948
The metropolitan police fought
the streetgangs.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.538
Hurry up before the Black
Joke get here!

28:05.538 --> 28:07.708
There were 37 amateur fire-
brigades.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.538
They all fought each other.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.418
The Black Joke are on
their way!

28:17.718 --> 28:22.468
Okay boys, get the hoses!

28:28.269 --> 28:31.149
It's the Black Joke!

28:31.859 --> 28:33.279
Go get 'm boys!

28:34.689 --> 28:36.449
Give those Bowery boys
help!

28:37.279 --> 28:38.609
Quick before there's nothing
left!

28:38.609 --> 28:40.579
Go back to the Bowery,
ya bum!

28:42.289 --> 28:43.579
For gods sake. They're taking
everything!

28:43.579 --> 28:45.409
In your next time of trouble
ma'm....

28:45.409 --> 28:46.869
...call Tammany first!

28:46.869 --> 28:48.999
It's not too late. You can
still save my house!

28:51.039 --> 28:51.419
Let's go!

28:53.169 --> 28:54.919
I thought you said you
were hungry!

29:00.010 --> 29:01.890
Grab what you can. Let's get
out of here!

29:02.760 --> 29:06.480
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

29:06.930 --> 29:09.600
And may I point out that this
area is the provenance...

29:09.600 --> 29:11.190
..of my own America's firebrigade.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.900
And that you lot only belong
in the Bowery.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.900
May I point out that you are
outmanned, outmanouvered...

29:17.950 --> 29:20.910
...and at the moment outfought!

29:21.490 --> 29:22.030
Am I?

29:29.210 --> 29:30.380
There's the Black Joke!

29:30.380 --> 29:34.751
Let's get 'm!

29:37.471 --> 29:38.971
Clear the way for
Bill the Butcher.

29:39.681 --> 29:41.761
Okay boys, to work!

29:43.101 --> 29:44.101
What's the point?

29:44.101 --> 29:46.811
The fire's near burnt eveything
of value inside.

29:47.141 --> 29:50.481
Boys forget that one.
Next building over.

29:50.941 --> 29:51.941
Mustn't let it spread!

29:51.941 --> 29:53.401
Grab what you want from
that one!

29:53.401 --> 29:56.651
What are you doing? There's
nothing wrong with this one!

30:19.802 --> 30:21.302
Come on. Johnny. Get up!

30:22.262 --> 30:22.722
Leave that.

30:31.272 --> 30:32.152
You two, on your way!

30:50.293 --> 30:51.463
His name's Amsterdam.

30:54.833 --> 30:55.593
How's the beak?

30:56.593 --> 30:57.343
Ain't so bad.

30:58.053 --> 31:01.053
You. You got anything or you
can get out.

31:13.353 --> 31:13.943
Is that it?

31:15.484 --> 31:16.064
That's it.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.034
Right. Here's the rake.

31:20.494 --> 31:22.074
Everything comes here we
fence it.

31:22.324 --> 31:25.624
Johnny takes our tribute to the
Natives and we chop up....

31:25.664 --> 31:28.624
....the winnings, each to his
equal portion of the gang.

31:29.744 --> 31:31.914
Does that meet with your
approval, Hell Gate?

31:33.504 --> 31:34.504
My approval?

31:35.254 --> 31:37.674
What's the matter Jack Sprat,
can't you think for yourself!

31:39.804 --> 31:41.634
I'll slit your fucking throat!

31:47.684 --> 31:50.645
You boys settle with me, before
settling with each other.

31:55.105 --> 31:56.945
I come for my due
and proper.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.255
This ain't a bad haul.

32:19.545 --> 32:22.425
You know, when the folks say the
country is going to hell...

32:23.136 --> 32:25.846
...I always tell them, look at
all the hard work...

32:25.846 --> 32:28.726
..our fine young lads are doing
down in the Points.

32:29.856 --> 32:33.606
Oh, yeah. This is just the
thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

32:34.146 --> 32:38.196
Alright Happy Jack. Leave us for
something to give Bill de Butcher.

32:38.736 --> 32:39.316
Would ya?

32:52.296 --> 32:53.876
Not my favorite tune.

33:02.137 --> 33:03.057
Thank you, boys.

33:04.887 --> 33:06.597
You keep out of trouble
now.

33:26.197 --> 33:30.077
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.958
At Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott street.

33:36.628 --> 33:39.508
The chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

33:43.928 --> 33:47.768
The drum rolls and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

33:51.768 --> 33:56.648
When you kill a king, you don't
stab him in the dark.

33:59.358 --> 34:03.988
You kill him where the whole
court can watch him die.

34:08.498 --> 34:09.708
Got any timber?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.930
Hi, Maggie. Rightie or leftie?

35:02.930 --> 35:04.760
Give us a drink.

35:04.760 --> 35:05.850
Help yourself.

35:11.430 --> 35:13.310
Two minutes. Place
your bets.

35:13.481 --> 35:17.731
Gentlemen. The match is due
to commence.

35:18.071 --> 35:21.441
The count to be is,
25 rodents in 3 minutes.

35:21.821 --> 35:23.151
Rouser against the vermin.

35:24.491 --> 35:25.161
Satisfied?

35:25.451 --> 35:26.201
50!

35:26.241 --> 35:26.741
Yes!

35:41.801 --> 35:42.671
Where are you going, boil?

35:43.631 --> 35:44.931
I'm here to pay tribute
to Bill.

35:44.931 --> 35:45.761
Are you now?

35:46.181 --> 35:47.512
Give it to me. I'll give
it to him.

35:47.802 --> 35:49.222
No thanks. I'll give it to
him myself.

35:52.232 --> 35:54.692
What do you want to keep, the
money or your teeth?

35:54.692 --> 35:55.272
John?

35:57.272 --> 35:57.942
Welcome.

36:07.162 --> 36:08.242
From me and the lads, sir.

36:16.252 --> 36:17.132
Mate of yours?

36:17.832 --> 36:18.422
Where's he from?

36:20.172 --> 36:21.302
He's not from here, sir.

36:24.973 --> 36:25.723
YOU!

36:44.033 --> 36:45.283
That's close enough!

36:57.464 --> 36:58.924
Your friend can't look me
in the eye...

36:58.924 --> 37:00.884
...that's not an admirable
characteristic.

37:02.214 --> 37:03.594
No one can look you in the
eye, Bill..

37:04.014 --> 37:05.424
...not when you're playing
cards.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.244
This is whist, it's a
gentleman's game.

37:27.244 --> 37:28.454
Make a gentleman's bet.

37:28.824 --> 37:30.075
I am betting large, Bill!

37:30.625 --> 37:31.665
That ain't large.

37:41.505 --> 37:43.465
Don't make that noise
again, Harvey.

37:47.095 --> 37:49.935
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

37:53.815 --> 37:56.105
How do you fair on water?
Come closer.

37:56.935 --> 37:58.395
Closer. I ain't gonna bite!

38:03.115 --> 38:05.696
There's a Portugese ship lying
low in the harbour....

38:05.946 --> 38:07.536
...quarantined three weeks.

38:07.536 --> 38:09.996
Get there before the Day Break
Boys strip her.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.536
Maybe you and me wil talk
some more.

38:11.536 --> 38:12.576
Consider it done, sir.

38:12.576 --> 38:13.416
Good boy.

38:15.286 --> 38:16.166
And you...

38:16.166 --> 38:16.956
...whatever you name is.

38:16.956 --> 38:17.796
What is your name?

38:22.676 --> 38:23.716
Amsterdam, sir.

38:24.426 --> 38:25.846
Amsterdam?

38:27.176 --> 38:28.516
I'm New York.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.686
Don't you ever come in
here empty handed again.

38:32.146 --> 38:34.106
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

38:35.266 --> 38:36.816
Take him for a boat ride, John.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.857
Maybe he'll save your life
again.

38:44.737 --> 38:47.327
If the Day Break boys catch us on
this river, they'll slit our throats!

38:47.327 --> 38:49.747
I'll do it myself, if you don't
keep quiet!

38:50.407 --> 38:52.617
I never liked the harbour
after dark.

38:52.617 --> 38:57.047
And now each night they brought
on shore the bodies of the soldiers.

38:57.047 --> 39:01.007
So many mothers don't even have the solace
of knowing where their sons have fallen.

39:01.007 --> 39:04.217
I lost my own eldest in Antida.

39:04.757 --> 39:07.307
His mother and I weren't able
to recover his remains.

39:07.307 --> 39:08.597
It was a mournful sight.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.137
The war can't last forever.

39:10.137 --> 39:12.228
But we had business of our
own.

39:21.898 --> 39:23.608
The Day Break boys have already
been here.

39:23.608 --> 39:25.368
There's nothing left. Let's
go back.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.368
What in hell...?

39:39.798 --> 39:41.048
Jimmy..get down!

39:44.218 --> 39:46.799
Jezus..that'll bring the
harbour cops for sure!

39:47.219 --> 39:47.639
Out of the way!

39:55.769 --> 39:56.479
Let's take a look.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.239
Jezus..they killed everybody!

40:02.819 --> 40:03.699
There's nothing here but...

40:04.399 --> 40:05.819
Watch it....dead sea crabs.

40:06.239 --> 40:07.119
Come on! Let's go.

40:10.159 --> 40:10.659
Shove off!

40:10.659 --> 40:12.369
No. Wait for Amsterdam!

40:12.369 --> 40:13.409
Where is Amsterdam?

40:17.079 --> 40:18.419
Take him, damn fool!

40:18.419 --> 40:19.419
What in the hell for?

40:19.879 --> 40:21.840
Look in my glims. I said no
less than 15!

40:21.840 --> 40:23.090
Is this fresh?

40:23.090 --> 40:24.550
Four hours most.

40:25.970 --> 40:27.180
Much obliged, gents.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.520
What's that word?

40:37.810 --> 40:39.520
It means bodysnatchers.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.820
I didn't ask the meaning.
I asked the word.

40:42.980 --> 40:43.570
Ghoul?

40:45.860 --> 40:46.740
Ghoul?

40:48.200 --> 40:49.120
That's a good word.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.871
A fresh outrage in the
Five Points.

40:56.291 --> 40:57.871
A notice that you can
be proud of.

40:58.331 --> 40:58.751
Thank you.

40:58.751 --> 41:02.001
Low thing, to do that to
a body.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.921
Low.

41:02.921 --> 41:05.171
Why? They could've left that
ship with nothing.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.761
Instead they made the Police
Gazette.

41:06.761 --> 41:08.591
A periodical of note.

41:09.591 --> 41:11.761
A body is supposed to stay
beneath the earth....

41:11.761 --> 41:13.311
...wearing a wooden coat...

41:13.311 --> 41:15.141
..until the resurrection.

41:15.601 --> 41:18.771
These two are just a pair of
bug eating sons of Irish bitches.
Just like you.

41:18.771 --> 41:19.941
Don't seem to bother them none.

41:20.861 --> 41:23.071
Maybe they don't share your
religious scruples.

41:23.861 --> 41:26.361
Maybe they're just a couple
of fiddeling bends.

41:32.242 --> 41:33.662
I've been called a lot of things,
mister...

41:33.742 --> 41:34.912
...but I've never been called..?

41:36.502 --> 41:37.502
Fiddeling bends.

41:37.502 --> 41:38.372
Fiddeling bends. Right.

41:42.212 --> 41:43.842
If I knew what in the hell
that meant..

41:44.632 --> 41:46.342
...I might be inclined to
take offense.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.382
A fiddeling bend is a fellow
who would steal anything...

41:49.932 --> 41:50.932
...dead or alive.

41:50.932 --> 41:54.352
Because he's too low to work up a
decent lay for himself.

41:54.352 --> 41:55.682
Count that careful.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.102
I'm telling you that's all there
is. That's all they gave us.

41:58.102 --> 41:58.772
That's all they gave us.

41:58.772 --> 41:59.352
Chiseler!

42:00.102 --> 42:02.813
If you had said chiseler, now
that's a word I understand.

42:03.823 --> 42:05.073
Is that what you're calling us?

42:05.073 --> 42:07.573
I can think of a number of things
to call you, boil!

42:07.573 --> 42:10.493
Right. But I asked if you was
calling us chiselers?

42:11.493 --> 42:13.283
Supposing I am?

42:16.293 --> 42:17.543
Well, then we got business.

42:19.833 --> 42:21.003
That we do!

42:31.133 --> 42:31.973
2 dollars on McGloin!

42:33.973 --> 42:34.553
5 pieces on the kid!

42:35.513 --> 42:36.264
5 on Amsterdam!

42:46.274 --> 42:48.194
Come on, McGloin, it's
just a kid.

42:59.754 --> 43:01.584
Watch his left, McGloin!

43:41.545 --> 43:43.375
Alright, that'll do.

43:43.375 --> 43:44.626
What do you say now, huh?

43:45.176 --> 43:46.636
That'll do, for Christ sake.

43:46.636 --> 43:47.636
Drag him off.

43:48.256 --> 43:49.096
That's enough, kid.

43:49.966 --> 43:51.216
You got him.

44:18.667 --> 44:23.007
McGloin? How would that head
look without the ears and nose on it?

44:25.127 --> 44:27.427
You'd better leave that head
alone, Bill.

44:27.967 --> 44:31.387
I think I'm gonna trim the beak
and the ears off that head.

44:32.597 --> 44:34.597
Make a nice pot of soup out of
that head.

44:35.137 --> 44:36.807
You can find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

44:37.727 --> 44:40.267
I ain't got no stomach
for an Irish stew.

44:43.857 --> 44:45.277
The mighty McGloin.

44:45.857 --> 44:47.907
Almost fish hooked by
a sprat.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.708
On the seventh day the Lord rested.

45:00.128 --> 45:01.168
But before that He did...

45:01.748 --> 45:03.878
...He squatted over the side
of England...

45:03.878 --> 45:07.758
...and what came out of him?
Ireland!

45:08.048 --> 45:09.008
No offense, son.

45:09.008 --> 45:10.298
None taken, sir.

45:10.638 --> 45:11.758
I grew up here.

45:12.058 --> 45:15.728
AllI ever knew of Ireland was in
the talk of others in the asylum.

45:16.928 --> 45:21.228
From which part of that
excrementitous island were your
forebares spawn?

45:21.858 --> 45:23.898
I've been told Carrey.

45:23.898 --> 45:26.358
But I lost proof of it in my
language in the asylum.

45:27.739 --> 45:30.779
I was raised in a similar
establishment myself.

45:31.159 --> 45:34.329
Everything you see belongs to
me, to degree or another.

45:34.869 --> 45:37.869
But beggars, quick thieves,
here in Paradise..

45:38.209 --> 45:41.329
...gymmills, blind tigers on
the waterfront...

45:41.749 --> 45:44.499
...anglers and the musers. The
she-he's and the chinks.

45:44.799 --> 45:46.919
Everybody owes...

45:46.919 --> 45:48.049
...everybody pays, because...

45:48.839 --> 45:52.049
...that's how you stand up,
to the rising of the tide.

45:52.929 --> 45:54.099
Is that right boys?

45:54.099 --> 45:55.099
Yes Bill, that's right.

45:56.469 --> 45:58.059
Enlist. Join up! Serve
your country.

46:01.940 --> 46:04.820
Volunteer and get your 50
dollar bonus!

46:04.820 --> 46:06.530
We need 30,000 volunteers..

46:06.530 --> 46:10.570
...and we're prepared to pay
677 dollar per volunteer.

46:10.950 --> 46:12.530
Please read this. Thank you.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.700
Would you like one to
fill out?

46:16.080 --> 46:17.410
3 square meals a day.

46:18.660 --> 46:20.210
3 square meals a day.
Young man?

46:20.540 --> 46:21.420
Enlist and...

46:21.420 --> 46:22.290
...serve you country.

46:22.710 --> 46:23.960
3 square meals a day, gentlemen!

46:24.790 --> 46:27.710
If you're interested, I suggest...

46:27.710 --> 46:30.430
Everywhere you went, people
talked about the daft.

46:30.430 --> 46:33.680
You could buy your way
out for 300 dollars.

46:34.100 --> 46:35.601
But who had 300 dollars?

46:35.891 --> 46:38.731
For us it had might as well
been 3 millions.

46:39.181 --> 46:41.691
The recruters were too scared
of the gangs...

46:41.691 --> 46:43.151
...to come after us.

46:43.441 --> 46:45.611
Besides, we never dreamt the war..

46:46.111 --> 46:48.321
...would ever touch
New York.

46:48.321 --> 46:49.571
Good morning, sir.

46:51.741 --> 46:52.411
You!

46:53.451 --> 46:54.621
Don't you run into me.

46:56.741 --> 46:57.451
Fair enough!

47:03.421 --> 47:04.751
I said don't run in to me!

47:05.921 --> 47:06.461
Sorry!

47:13.592 --> 47:14.512
Everything in place?

47:15.602 --> 47:16.472
It seems so.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.772
Then I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord.

47:20.182 --> 47:20.932
Thank you.

47:30.032 --> 47:31.612
Why that dirty...!

47:37.162 --> 47:37.782
Oh, no!

47:39.372 --> 47:40.162
Allow me!

47:43.543 --> 47:44.753
Thank you kindly, sir.

47:45.213 --> 47:46.383
It's my pleasure.

47:47.793 --> 47:48.923
I hope you don't mind if
I speak...

47:48.923 --> 47:51.263
..I don't want to appear forward.

47:52.513 --> 47:55.933
Well sir, that depends on what you
say!

48:05.233 --> 48:09.113
Would you call me wreckless, if I say
that you are the prettiest girl
in New York?

48:09.823 --> 48:11.483
Only New York?

48:14.283 --> 48:15.113
This is my stop.

48:17.664 --> 48:19.874
May I walk with you a little
then?

48:20.954 --> 48:23.504
That sir...would be too bold.

48:50.734 --> 48:53.445
For every lay we had a
different name.

48:54.535 --> 48:56.745
An Angler put a hook on the
end of a stick...

48:56.995 --> 48:59.415
...to drop behind store
windows and doors.

49:00.205 --> 49:02.875
An Autumn diver picked your
pocket in church.

49:04.005 --> 49:06.465
A Badger, gets a fellow in bed
with a girl...

49:06.465 --> 49:09.215
..and robs his pockets when
they're on the go.

49:10.175 --> 49:11.885
Jenny was a Bludger..

49:12.305 --> 49:13.765
...a girl pickpocket.

49:14.175 --> 49:16.635
And a Turtle dove.

49:19.515 --> 49:21.895
A Turtle dove goes uptown...

49:21.895 --> 49:22.895
...dressed like a housemaid.

49:22.895 --> 49:24.185
Picks out a fine house...

49:24.185 --> 49:28.736
...and goes right through the
back door. Robs you blind.

49:30.776 --> 49:33.526
It takes a lot of sand to
be a Turtle dove.

49:55.926 --> 49:57.096
I'll have my medal back.

49:57.346 --> 49:58.386
Oh, jezus.

50:06.567 --> 50:07.527
Don't do that again.

50:08.817 --> 50:10.407
I said, don't do that!

50:11.277 --> 50:13.657
Go back to the Points
and let me do my business...

50:13.657 --> 50:15.787
...or I will open your throat.

50:20.707 --> 50:21.117
Alright.

50:24.247 --> 50:25.087
Go on then.

50:28.297 --> 50:29.217
I would.

50:31.967 --> 50:32.717
Go on then.

50:56.868 --> 50:58.118
Give me back my medal.

50:58.578 --> 50:59.578
Make it quick.

51:07.999 --> 51:09.759
I don't know which one's
yours.

51:17.509 --> 51:19.429
Suppose I help myself to
everything.

51:22.769 --> 51:23.939
Suppose you do.

52:03.770 --> 52:05.350
Shall I walk with you a
little, then?

52:15.110 --> 52:17.371
What do you suppose a fellow
can earn up here in a day?

52:18.121 --> 52:19.531
Maybe we can pile in together?

52:19.531 --> 52:22.661
I think you're a bit rough for
this game.

52:23.251 --> 52:25.211
Besides, I work alone.

52:26.211 --> 52:26.831
Alone?

52:27.541 --> 52:28.961
What do you core to
the Butcher?

52:29.291 --> 52:29.841
Nothing.

52:30.501 --> 52:31.251
Nothing?

52:31.671 --> 52:33.671
The Butcher and me have a
special arrangement.

52:41.721 --> 52:43.021
I don't want to see
you again!

52:43.021 --> 52:44.431
I don't blame you.

52:46.561 --> 52:48.811
Pennies in their pockets and
hope in their eyes.

52:49.271 --> 52:50.732
They peer to the west.

52:51.442 --> 52:54.862
Searching the horizon for a
glimpse of land and salvation.

52:57.862 --> 52:59.452
A glimpse of America.

52:59.992 --> 53:03.042
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Mrs. Schermerhorn?

53:03.042 --> 53:06.462
Some days the uptown gangs
came to us.

53:07.422 --> 53:10.592
The Schermerhorns were one of the
oldest families in New York.

53:11.172 --> 53:12.212
They didn't run the city..

53:12.882 --> 53:15.722
...but they were listened to quite
carefully, by them who did.

53:15.722 --> 53:17.302
Commissioner Brunt, said you
wanted to view the Points....

53:17.302 --> 53:19.342
...in all its splendor an
squalor.

53:19.762 --> 53:22.142
Spare nothing concerning the
conditions, said he!

53:22.512 --> 53:25.313
Nothing except our safety,
constable.

53:25.643 --> 53:29.353
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's
company, my dear!

53:29.353 --> 53:31.483
Quite so, madam. Witness!

53:40.203 --> 53:41.493
Shall we continue on?

53:41.493 --> 53:43.083
You dare to leave it there?

53:43.373 --> 53:44.873
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greely.

53:45.243 --> 53:46.543
They all know it's mine.

53:48.163 --> 53:49.543
Is that man drunk?

53:49.923 --> 53:52.173
Dead as good friday, miss.

53:57.514 --> 53:58.804
Good day, Mulraney.

53:59.344 --> 53:59.974
Boys?

53:59.974 --> 54:00.344
Jack?

54:00.764 --> 54:01.934
Slum socialable?

54:01.934 --> 54:04.224
Track finding. Reform studying.

54:04.764 --> 54:05.394
May I present...

54:05.394 --> 54:09.644
The Schermerhorns hardly require
an introduction from you, Jack.

54:09.644 --> 54:11.694
Mrs. Schermerhorn and her
daughter.

54:12.234 --> 54:12.774
The gentleman of course is...

54:12.774 --> 54:14.864
Mr. Greely. The famous
publisher.

54:14.864 --> 54:15.984
It's a pleasure and an
honour, sir.

54:17.114 --> 54:17.994
Of the Tribune.

54:17.994 --> 54:19.074
I am William Cutting.

54:20.954 --> 54:22.244
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

54:24.874 --> 54:26.544
As of this moment,
extremely well.

54:26.834 --> 54:27.584
How do you do?

54:28.964 --> 54:31.084
Orange blossom. Delicious!

54:31.675 --> 54:33.085
Mr. Cutting is...

54:33.425 --> 54:35.845
What a peach! You had a fine
carreer on the stage.

54:35.965 --> 54:37.675
...one of the Five Points local...

54:37.675 --> 54:38.515
Please to meet you, sir.

54:38.975 --> 54:39.885
..leaders.

54:39.885 --> 54:40.685
Mr. Greely!

54:40.685 --> 54:41.725
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cutting.

54:41.725 --> 54:42.595
The Five Points welcomes you..

54:42.595 --> 54:43.855
...to these streets...

54:44.435 --> 54:45.815
..and you shall pas in
safety.

54:46.975 --> 54:48.565
I'll see to their safety.

54:49.395 --> 54:50.185
Thank you, Bill.

54:50.985 --> 54:51.735
This way.

54:52.275 --> 54:53.105
Good day lads.

54:53.565 --> 54:55.155
Criminals who brag
a dote show.

54:55.575 --> 54:56.325
He knows who I am!

54:56.325 --> 54:58.615
Inderdeed, sir. You are well
known in these parts.

55:00.535 --> 55:03.575
I find that strangely flattering.

55:03.575 --> 55:04.995
Never did like crushers.

55:04.995 --> 55:06.036
Well draw it mild, son.

55:06.456 --> 55:09.456
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without me telling him to.

55:23.596 --> 55:25.606
Do you think my watch would be
safe in that lamp post, Bill?

55:29.066 --> 55:30.606
Why don't you hang it
up there and see?

55:34.236 --> 55:35.026
Some day.

55:37.196 --> 55:38.446
Some day is right.

55:40.327 --> 55:41.327
Is this the new lad?

55:43.037 --> 55:47.087
just another bastard I folded
in the warmth of my embrace.

55:50.627 --> 55:51.627
Hey!

55:51.917 --> 55:53.217
Just wanted to see your face,
son.

55:54.177 --> 55:55.217
No harm intended.

56:19.278 --> 56:21.288
You get to know a lot by
butchering meat.

56:23.828 --> 56:25.418
We're made up of the same
things.

56:25.418 --> 56:28.538
Flesh and blood. Tissue. Organs.

56:29.998 --> 56:31.668
I love to work with pigs.

56:32.878 --> 56:36.968
The nearest thing in nature to
the flesh of a man, is the
flesh a pig.

56:38.218 --> 56:39.098
Pig, huh?

56:39.548 --> 56:39.798
That's right.

56:40.808 --> 56:41.848
This is for you, mother.

56:45.808 --> 56:46.518
Here you are.

56:47.899 --> 56:48.729
God bless you.

56:50.269 --> 56:51.729
She ain't really my mother.

56:52.819 --> 56:53.819
I knew that, Bill.

56:58.989 --> 57:00.159
This is the liver.

57:01.699 --> 57:04.829
The kidneys. The heart.

57:05.749 --> 57:08.919
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

57:09.289 --> 57:10.419
This is a kill.

57:11.209 --> 57:12.299
This is a kill.

57:13.589 --> 57:15.589
And the artery. This is a kill.

57:18.129 --> 57:19.049
You try it.

57:23.310 --> 57:24.060
Go ahead.

57:50.630 --> 57:52.670
Don't follow the blade
on the rib.

57:53.250 --> 57:53.880
Very good!

57:54.210 --> 57:54.800
And the artery.

57:55.550 --> 57:58.551
Bleed 'm slow. Let them think
about it for a while.

57:58.551 --> 57:59.511
Slow death.

57:59.801 --> 58:00.221
Good!

58:02.971 --> 58:04.761
You'll each bill the city
5000 dollars a month...

58:04.761 --> 58:06.061
..for supplies and services..

58:06.271 --> 58:07.681
...for which you will
receive 10%.

58:08.101 --> 58:12.061
Bill! Mr. Glour will work out
the details. Thank you.

58:12.401 --> 58:14.401
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

58:15.231 --> 58:16.231
Who's this?

58:18.401 --> 58:19.531
Thank you, boys.

58:20.241 --> 58:21.111
Good day, sir.

58:34.092 --> 58:35.422
You got something on
your mind?

58:39.552 --> 58:40.842
Bill's taking quite a liking
to you.

58:44.222 --> 58:45.262
If you're up to something..

58:46.222 --> 58:50.022
...I don't want no
part in it.

58:55.112 --> 58:56.982
I was in Hell Gate for
16 years.

58:58.992 --> 59:00.742
I'm just trying to make my
way is all...

59:01.532 --> 59:02.702
...just like you.

59:04.323 --> 59:06.453
Less of course you got
a better notion?

59:08.453 --> 59:09.003
No.

59:10.873 --> 59:13.883
I can't get a days work
done...

59:13.883 --> 59:16.003
...for all the good citizens
coming here..

59:16.633 --> 59:17.633
...harrassing me about
crime in the Points.

59:18.463 --> 59:21.923
Some even go so far to accuse
Tammany of connivance..

59:22.303 --> 59:24.643
..in this so called rampant
criminality.

59:25.053 --> 59:26.933
What can I do?
I can't have this.

59:26.933 --> 59:28.183
Something has to be done.

59:28.183 --> 59:29.563
What do you have in mind?

59:29.563 --> 59:32.643
I don't know. Maybe we
should hang someone.

59:34.233 --> 59:34.943
Who?

59:35.153 --> 59:37.863
No one important necessarily.

59:37.863 --> 59:40.444
Back alley thieves, with
no affiliations.

59:41.494 --> 59:42.204
How many?

59:42.784 --> 59:43.744
3 or 4.

59:45.324 --> 59:46.074
Which?

59:46.624 --> 59:47.494
Vier.

59:49.164 --> 59:53.794
You stand here convicted..

59:53.794 --> 59:56.254
...of ludeness, jackrolling...

59:56.254 --> 01:00:01.514
...sneak thievery, chloral
hydrating, sodomy..

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:07.104
...strangulation and corruption
of the public good.

01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:11.684
Chin up.

01:00:11.974 --> 01:00:13.645
Handsome bunch of gallows
food!

01:00:13.645 --> 01:00:14.395
There's my old friend.

01:00:14.395 --> 01:00:15.525
How are you feeling, Arthur?

01:00:15.525 --> 01:00:17.115
I'm okay. Okay you know.

01:00:17.525 --> 01:00:20.485
Say hello to Amsterdam.
He nearly fish hooked McGloin.

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:21.235
Nearly!

01:00:21.865 --> 01:00:23.535
I see that you are dressed for
the occasion, Arthur.

01:00:23.955 --> 01:00:26.205
You know me, Bill. Always
like to look me best.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.375
That's the spirit.

01:00:28.955 --> 01:00:30.995
Nice locket. I'll give you
a dollar for it.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.205
It's me mother's.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.255
Dollar and a halve?

01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:37.085
Done.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.805
I'll miss you, Arthur.

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:44.725
See you in the hot
country, Shamus.

01:00:52.976 --> 01:00:54.856
Is my son present here?

01:00:56.566 --> 01:00:58.106
Where's my little fellow?

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:01.326
Look at your dad.

01:01:02.446 --> 01:01:04.156
Farewell dear boy.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:08.746
I never struck a foul blow..

01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:10.876
..or turned a card.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:15.126
May God greet me as a friend!

01:01:47.617 --> 01:01:50.207
That night the Reformers
held a dance.

01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.207
That was the Five Points
alright....

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:56.168
...hangings in the morning,
a dance in the evening.

01:01:56.548 --> 01:01:57.758
To be sure!

01:01:58.628 --> 01:02:01.638
It's not a matter of words,
but by the way she smiles at me.

01:02:01.638 --> 01:02:03.348
She smiles at a lot of
people, John.

01:02:05.098 --> 01:02:07.638
A penny, for a fighting
Irishman?

01:02:12.058 --> 01:02:12.808
Are you from Carey?

01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:14.188
I am sir.

01:02:16.478 --> 01:02:17.358
It ain't much.

01:02:17.778 --> 01:02:18.688
Thank you.

01:02:19.358 --> 01:02:23.278
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
delighted to see so many young faces..

01:02:23.278 --> 01:02:25.658
...at our first annual
mission dance.

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:27.408
This will be a real circus!

01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:30.579
The mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.959
...and we are happy to greet
our Roman catholic friends...

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.129
...who join us here tonight.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.549
Ladies....come with me.

01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:43.299
We're going to start the dance
in just a moment.

01:02:47.559 --> 01:02:48.559
Good evening, your Holyness.

01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.519
Good evening, Reverend.

01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:54.979
You should have shaved
closer!

01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:00.989
Good evening, Reverend.

01:03:01.279 --> 01:03:02.450
I'd like to make a pardon.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:07.990
Miss...?

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:14.130
Everdeane.

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:16.040
Miss Everdeane.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.930
Gentlemen, over here! If
you don't mind.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.020
Thank you.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.310
Open it. Hold it up!

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:39.901
Into the mirror.

01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:33.962
That one!

01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:38.542
Our queen has chosen.

01:04:58.233 --> 01:04:58.983
Sir...

01:05:00.153 --> 01:05:00.983
...your lady!

01:05:02.693 --> 01:05:05.863
Regular services are held in
the church at 6 and 8.

01:05:05.863 --> 01:05:06.703
Go to hell.

01:05:16.293 --> 01:05:17.423
What do you think your
doing?

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:18.543
I'm dancing.

01:05:18.543 --> 01:05:19.714
Why did you pick me?

01:05:20.544 --> 01:05:21.844
That's none of your business.

01:05:22.004 --> 01:05:23.464
Would you mind telling me?

01:05:24.714 --> 01:05:25.174
Sorry!

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.184
I'm not much of a dancer.

01:05:33.474 --> 01:05:34.774
Try and stay calm.

01:05:35.484 --> 01:05:37.484
I've never been to a dance
before!

01:05:37.484 --> 01:05:38.774
It's best not to look down.

01:05:41.944 --> 01:05:43.364
You can hold me tighter if
you like.

01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:52.494
Alright.

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:53.035
Okay!

01:05:55.915 --> 01:05:57.375
Why didn't you dance
with Johnny?

01:06:00.175 --> 01:06:01.215
Because...

01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:05.635
...I didn't want him.

01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:06.027
I'm not good in this.

01:07:14.457 --> 01:07:14.877
Wait!

01:07:14.877 --> 01:07:15.167
What?

01:07:15.587 --> 01:07:15.917
Wait.

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:18.877
How does this open?

01:07:19.337 --> 01:07:20.757
It takes too long to lace
back up...

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.217
...we'll be here all night.

01:07:34.727 --> 01:07:36.228
Alright. I'll take it off.

01:07:59.168 --> 01:08:00.918
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

01:08:06.178 --> 01:08:06.888
Sorry!

01:08:09.469 --> 01:08:10.349
It's fine.

01:08:15.099 --> 01:08:16.349
Have you got any scars?

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:19.899
A few.

01:09:19.001 --> 01:09:19.921
What's that then?

01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:21.591
That?

01:09:22.751 --> 01:09:24.011
A gift from Mr. Cutting.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.180
A gift?

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:32.761
A gift!

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.020
Was it your birthday?

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:38.600
No.

01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:44.781
What did you give him?

01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:50.031
The answer to that has nothing
to do with you.

01:09:57.582 --> 01:09:59.752
Don't tell me you're angry
with me?

01:09:59.752 --> 01:10:02.042
No..I'm through with you.

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:09.762
Well, you're quicker then
most fellows...

01:10:09.762 --> 01:10:11.972
...generally they wait till
afterwards!

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.262
I ain't interested..

01:10:14.262 --> 01:10:15.182
...in the Butcher's leavings.

01:10:35.703 --> 01:10:37.543
Stay away from the pikers.

01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:39.663
15 to 1. Bug Eye Ward!

01:10:39.663 --> 01:10:40.673
Amsterdam!

01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:43.253
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

01:10:43.883 --> 01:10:44.963
We ran his errands..

01:10:44.963 --> 01:10:45.883
...made his money...

01:10:45.883 --> 01:10:46.593
...took a piece...

01:10:46.593 --> 01:10:47.843
...and said thank you, sir.

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:48.843
Gentlemen in the ring!

01:10:49.263 --> 01:10:50.683
Even Tweed!

01:10:50.883 --> 01:10:52.263
The fight's over!

01:10:52.263 --> 01:10:52.973
Even me.

01:10:54.973 --> 01:10:56.223
My father's son.

01:10:56.813 --> 01:10:57.563
What the hell is this?

01:10:57.973 --> 01:10:58.683
Sorry, Bill.

01:10:59.103 --> 01:11:00.444
The city ordenance against
boxing...

01:11:01.144 --> 01:11:02.984
...is a blight. I grant you.

01:11:02.904 --> 01:11:04.444
I'm losing money while
you speak.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:06.274
Go out there and collect
those bets.

01:11:06.274 --> 01:11:08.154
How do I collect, if no one
won the fight?

01:11:08.534 --> 01:11:10.244
This counts as a no decision.

01:11:10.244 --> 01:11:11.284
You've got that covered,
right?

01:11:11.284 --> 01:11:13.114
Didn't anyone pay off the
god damn police?

01:11:13.114 --> 01:11:14.704
Yes, the municipal police...

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:15.914
...this is the metropolitan
police.

01:11:15.914 --> 01:11:17.454
You're going to repay me
every cent.

01:11:17.454 --> 01:11:18.454
Wait! Mr. Tweed!

01:11:18.454 --> 01:11:19.454
Who asked for your opinion?

01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:20.254
Let him speak!

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:22.174
We don't answer to you.

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:25.214
The law says there's no
boxing in the city, right?

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:26.294
That's right, in the city.

01:11:26.634 --> 01:11:27.884
Where does the city end?

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:39.065
The winner...in the
75th round...

01:11:41.185 --> 01:11:43.855
Allow me to acknowledge the
man who's vision..

01:11:43.855 --> 01:11:47.325
...and enterprise, made possible
the staging of this noble combat...

01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:54.575
...in this inspiring and entirely
legal surroundings, Mr. William Cutting!

01:11:57.665 --> 01:12:01.795
And his young associate.

01:12:10.636 --> 01:12:12.926
Well done. You're a
quick learner.

01:12:13.346 --> 01:12:14.056
We done good.

01:12:14.476 --> 01:12:15.186
We done well.

01:12:15.806 --> 01:12:17.896
May I have your kind
attention?

01:12:18.356 --> 01:12:23.946
May I remind you of the wonders
of my museum on Broadway...

01:12:24.946 --> 01:12:28.826
...P.T.Barnum's gallery of
wonders!

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.706
It's a funny feeling
being taken...

01:12:39.706 --> 01:12:40.956
...under the wing of a dragon.

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.257
It's warmer than you think.

01:12:45.377 --> 01:12:47.967
That's the building of our
country right there, Mr. Cutting.

01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:49.847
Americans are borning.

01:12:50.427 --> 01:12:53.977
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

01:12:54.427 --> 01:12:56.437
Irish, who do jobs for a nickel...

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:57.897
...that niggers do for a dime...

01:12:57.897 --> 01:13:00.227
...and a white man used to
get a quarter for.

01:13:00.227 --> 01:13:02.977
What have they done? Name one
thing they've contributed!

01:13:02.977 --> 01:13:03.227
Votes!

01:13:03.227 --> 01:13:04.687
Votes, you say?

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.447
They vote on who the
Archbishop tells them...

01:13:07.447 --> 01:13:08.567
...and who tells him?

01:13:08.567 --> 01:13:12.157
Their king in the pointy hat,
who sits on his throne in Rome.

01:13:12.987 --> 01:13:15.868
He's got mixed feelings with
regards to the Irish.

01:13:15.868 --> 01:13:21.128
Bill, deliver these good and
fervant folk to the polls.

01:13:21.538 --> 01:13:25.128
And there will be a handsome price
for each vote that goes Tammany's way.

01:13:28.588 --> 01:13:30.338
Miy father gave his life...

01:13:30.338 --> 01:13:32.218
...making this country
what it is.

01:13:32.218 --> 01:13:37.558
Murdered by the British, with all
of his men, July 25 juli, 1814.

01:13:37.558 --> 01:13:41.358
You think I'm going to help
you, befoul his legacy?

01:13:41.358 --> 01:13:43.318
By giving this country to them...

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.778
...who's had no hand in
fighting for it.

01:13:44.778 --> 01:13:46.898
Why? Because they come off the
boat crawling with lice...

01:13:46.898 --> 01:13:48.238
...and begging you for soup?

01:13:49.609 --> 01:13:52.029
You're a great one for the
fighting Bill, I know...

01:13:52.029 --> 01:13:53.789
...but you can't fight
forever.

01:13:53.789 --> 01:13:54.909
I can go down doing it .

01:13:54.909 --> 01:13:55.949
And you will.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:01.789
What did you say?

01:14:02.789 --> 01:14:05.049
I said, you're turning you
back on the future.

01:14:07.969 --> 01:14:09.339
Not our future.

01:14:15.809 --> 01:14:17.389
That document makes you
a citizen...

01:14:17.389 --> 01:14:19.519
...this one makes you a
private in the Union army.

01:14:19.939 --> 01:14:21.059
Now go fight for your country.

01:14:21.519 --> 01:14:22.359
Next.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.070
Sign here, son.

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:26.480
Or make your mark.

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:47.670
Here's your musket. Make sure
you keep it dry on the boat.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.550
Where  are we going?

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:51.550
I heard Tennessee.

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.071
Do they feed us now, you think?

01:15:18.121 --> 01:15:21.621
My children, my chidren.

01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:26.211
We must heal the divisions between us!

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:33.762
This war must cease. North and
South must stand united.

01:15:43.442 --> 01:15:44.692
What happens at the finish?

01:15:45.402 --> 01:15:47.402
Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!

01:15:48.782 --> 01:15:51.192
Ain't you never been to a theatre before?

01:15:51.362 --> 01:15:51.992
No.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:55.912
Mr Legree, lay down your whip.

01:15:56.822 --> 01:16:00.452
Miss Elisa join hands with mr. Shelby.

01:16:00.452 --> 01:16:04.252
And Topsy. Dear little Topsy.

01:16:04.622 --> 01:16:07.093
Cradle Uncle Tom's head.

01:16:07.633 --> 01:16:09.423
Leave the nigger dead.

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.273
Down with the Union!

01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:28.063
Down with the Union!

01:16:48.424 --> 01:16:49.714
For the blood of the Irish.

01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:51.674
Bill, get down!

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.974
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:45.105
Who's man are you?

01:17:45.435 --> 01:17:46.985
Speak smart and speak up!

01:17:48.856 --> 01:17:50.276
What's he saying?

01:17:51.986 --> 01:17:54.576
I think he's making his peace with God.

01:17:54.576 --> 01:17:55.656
To hell with that!

01:17:56.116 --> 01:17:57.366
He makes his peace with me.

01:17:57.366 --> 01:18:00.956
I'm hearing your confession tonight,
you Irish whore!

01:18:00.956 --> 01:18:02.086
Who's man are you?

01:18:02.456 --> 01:18:03.956
We speak English in this country.

01:18:03.956 --> 01:18:04.796
Who's man are you?

01:18:04.796 --> 01:18:06.336
Do you see this knife, I'm
gonna teach...

01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:08.876
...you to speak English with
this knife!

01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:10.046
Who's man are you?

01:18:10.796 --> 01:18:12.346
Who's man are you?

01:18:28.277 --> 01:18:30.277
Well that didn't tell us very much.

01:18:34.157 --> 01:18:35.577
Fine waist coat.

01:18:36.947 --> 01:18:39.037
Shame, I don't think it can be mended!

01:18:40.957 --> 01:18:43.207
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

01:19:17.698 --> 01:19:19.658
Where's Legree? Where's Topsy?

01:19:20.578 --> 01:19:24.458
Jezus, let's continue.
Intermission is over.

01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:44.649
Now that was bloody Shakespearian.

01:19:45.769 --> 01:19:46.359
What?

01:19:46.359 --> 01:19:47.819
Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?

01:19:49.859 --> 01:19:51.609
He was the fellow who wrote the
King James' Bible.

01:19:52.699 --> 01:19:54.569
Mr., I don't know what you are
talking about.

01:19:54.859 --> 01:19:57.119
Because you're an ignorant
Irish welp!

01:19:58.199 --> 01:19:59.289
Just like your father.

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:07.000
That's it. Tear my head off and
destruct the world.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.670
Just like the other stupid Irish
in this country.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.510
That's why I never ran with your dad.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:14.510
Get off me you crazy bastard!

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:21.220
It means if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.640
I don't know if your being too clever
or too dumb.

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.900
But whatever it is, remember
this much.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.190
For all his faults, your father was
a man who loved his people.

01:20:39.161 --> 01:20:43.581
Amsterdam. Amsterdam. New York is
calling you.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:59.011
Look at that. What in Christ's
name is that?

01:21:00.761 --> 01:21:04.431
Rythms of the  dark continent,
thrown into the kettle...

01:21:04.431 --> 01:21:10.861
...with an Irish shindig. Stir it around a few times.
Poured out as a fine American mess.

01:21:11.771 --> 01:21:13.152
A jig, doing a jig!

01:21:15.452 --> 01:21:16.652
A little keep sake.

01:21:20.702 --> 01:21:21.582
Good on ya, sir.

01:21:21.582 --> 01:21:22.992
Come upstairs with me Bill.

01:21:24.832 --> 01:21:25.962
Have I ever had you before?

01:21:28.962 --> 01:21:30.922
So you don't call me by my
christian name.

01:21:32.842 --> 01:21:35.132
Bill. My god you're alright!

01:21:35.132 --> 01:21:37.222
I heard the news and came over
as quick as I could.

01:21:37.632 --> 01:21:39.762
As timely as the angel of death.

01:21:41.802 --> 01:21:44.772
You're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what your suggesting?

01:21:44.772 --> 01:21:46.643
Stop slabbering. If I thought
it was you...

01:21:46.643 --> 01:21:48.193
...you'd be in a wooden coat.

01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:50.313
I've got a hole in my shoulder
and it hurts...

01:21:50.313 --> 01:21:51.903
...so have a drink and shut up.

01:21:51.903 --> 01:21:53.403
Or shut up and get out.

01:21:55.073 --> 01:21:56.403
I believe I'll have a drink.

01:21:56.403 --> 01:21:59.323
Carefull, Tweedy the morts
are frenchified!

01:22:00.743 --> 01:22:01.873
No, I'm clean.

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:16.883
Jenny.

01:22:16.883 --> 01:22:17.513
Bill.

01:22:36.694 --> 01:22:37.404
I'll wrap you up.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.244
It's gotta be tight.

01:22:44.624 --> 01:22:45.874
Loves to make me cry.

01:22:47.454 --> 01:22:48.374
You can take it!

01:22:58.175 --> 01:22:59.475
There's my boy.

01:23:06.185 --> 01:23:07.015
It's alright.

01:23:13.445 --> 01:23:14.615
To the Butcher!

01:23:19.865 --> 01:23:21.405
We're all much obliged.

01:23:23.705 --> 01:23:24.875
Forever.

01:23:25.415 --> 01:23:28.125
To the Butcher!

01:23:37.466 --> 01:23:38.636
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

01:23:42.516 --> 01:23:43.306
Go on. Go!

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.157
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

01:24:03.537 --> 01:24:03.917
Yes!

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:04.917
You!

01:24:16.547 --> 01:24:17.507
Belt down!

01:24:29.897 --> 01:24:31.027
Try it and I'll bite ya.

01:24:32.277 --> 01:24:33.397
You were gonna bite me.

01:24:34.447 --> 01:24:35.567
I dont think you want me.

01:24:35.567 --> 01:24:36.657
Find out.

01:25:09.978 --> 01:25:10.688
Oh, Jenny!

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.690
I can't sleep.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.460
I hope you don't mind us
laying here, sir?

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.710
Whatever takes your fancy,
young friend.

01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:23.681
Is your shoulder keeping you up?

01:26:24.511 --> 01:26:26.391
I don't sleep too much.

01:26:27.851 --> 01:26:30.441
I sleep with one eye open. I only
got one eye.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.321
How old are you Amsterdam?

01:26:44.281 --> 01:26:48.121
Not too sure. Never did
figure it.

01:26:49.961 --> 01:26:51.831
I'm 47.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.382
47 years old.

01:27:00.092 --> 01:27:03.592
You know how I stayed alive
this long? All these years.

01:27:06.392 --> 01:27:07.222
Fear!

01:27:09.982 --> 01:27:12.192
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

01:27:14.192 --> 01:27:17.112
Somebody steals from me, I cut
off his hands.

01:27:17.112 --> 01:27:20.032
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:25.032
He rises against me, I cut off his
head, stick it on a pike!

01:27:26.282 --> 01:27:29.373
Raise it high up, so all in the
streets can see.

01:27:31.583 --> 01:27:33.673
That's what preserves the order
of things.

01:27:38.423 --> 01:27:39.133
Fear.

01:27:42.843 --> 01:27:45.853
That one tonight. Who was he?

01:27:48.433 --> 01:27:52.233
A nobody. A coward.

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:58.193
What an end that
would have been.

01:28:00.073 --> 01:28:03.574
I killed the last honourable man
15 years ago.

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:06.374
Since then....

01:28:09.704 --> 01:28:11.204
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

01:28:16.174 --> 01:28:17.844
Has your mouth been glued up with juice?

01:28:17.844 --> 01:28:19.214
I asked you a question!

01:28:19.214 --> 01:28:20.714
I said I've seen it, sir.

01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:29.814
You got a murderous rage in you.
I like it.

01:28:30.394 --> 01:28:33.524
So much life boiling up in you.
That's good!

01:28:37.985 --> 01:28:41.325
The priest and me lived by the
same principles.

01:28:44.655 --> 01:28:46.785
Only faith divided us.

01:28:50.285 --> 01:28:51.795
He gave me this you know?

01:28:57.835 --> 01:29:00.135
That was the finest beating I
ever took.

01:29:01.715 --> 01:29:06.385
My face was pulp. My guts pierced.
My ribs all messed up.

01:29:11.766 --> 01:29:13.436
When he came to finish me...

01:29:18.656 --> 01:29:20.276
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

01:29:27.366 --> 01:29:28.956
He spared me because...

01:29:30.536 --> 01:29:32.416
....he wanted me to live in shame.

01:29:32.416 --> 01:29:33.836
This was a great man.

01:29:37.426 --> 01:29:38.506
A great man.

01:29:42.556 --> 01:29:44.677
So I cut out the eye that
looked away.

01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:50.607
Sent it to him wrapped in
blue paper.

01:29:52.107 --> 01:29:54.647
I would've cut them both out if I
could afford being blind.

01:29:57.567 --> 01:29:59.657
I rose up again with a full heart...

01:30:00.817 --> 01:30:02.777
...and buried him in his own blood.

01:30:12.837 --> 01:30:13.497
Well done!

01:30:17.628 --> 01:30:20.178
He was the only man I killed
worth remembering.

01:30:32.898 --> 01:30:34.398
I never had a son.

01:30:43.658 --> 01:30:45.618
Civilisation is crumbling.

01:31:04.889 --> 01:31:05.969
God bless you!

01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:39.616
If you've got anything to say...

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:42.996
...now is the time to say it.

01:31:44.586 --> 01:31:45.746
Who is he to you, Jenny?

01:31:52.886 --> 01:31:54.346
I was 12 years old.

01:31:55.716 --> 01:31:58.306
My mother was dead. I was living
in a doorway.

01:32:01.686 --> 01:32:08.107
He took me in. Took care of me in
his own way.

01:32:14.117 --> 01:32:15.777
After they cut out the baby...

01:32:19.577 --> 01:32:22.077
He doesn't fancy girls that
scarred up.

01:32:29.837 --> 01:32:33.217
You should know, in your own mind...

01:32:35.587 --> 01:32:38.598
...that he never laid a hand on me
till I asked him too.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.368
Who are you?

01:33:05.248 --> 01:33:06.668
Who are you?

01:34:24.501 --> 01:34:31.711
Gentlemen, you are most welcome to
this palace of enchantment...

01:34:32.211 --> 01:34:40.471
...with visions to rival the tales of
Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!

01:35:04.702 --> 01:35:06.752
Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!

01:35:07.332 --> 01:35:09.922
Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...

01:35:11.082 --> 01:35:12.422
...of these creatures.

01:35:13.132 --> 01:35:16.342
Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!

01:35:17.012 --> 01:35:19.632
How would you like to make them sing?

01:35:20.222 --> 01:35:25.312
They could be singing for you.

01:35:32.483 --> 01:35:36.113
May God put the spirit of the
holy steel in my spine...

01:35:37.443 --> 01:35:40.323
...and the love of the blessed
Virgin in my heart.

01:35:43.783 --> 01:35:44.663
Amen.

01:35:49.503 --> 01:35:52.633
Easy now. What did you say?

01:35:53.503 --> 01:35:55.253
He's not who he says he is.

01:35:57.133 --> 01:35:58.673
He's not who he says he is?

01:36:03.554 --> 01:36:05.764
Count you blessings he considers
you a friend!

01:36:07.974 --> 01:36:12.144
The only thing he considers every day
and night is how to kill you!

01:36:15.024 --> 01:36:17.614
Those eyes want me to take
them out for you!

01:36:19.284 --> 01:36:21.534
I'll bury it up you fundunem where
it belongs!

01:36:22.244 --> 01:36:24.574
I can read right through them!
They're empty...

01:36:24.574 --> 01:36:25.624
His name is Vallon.

01:36:28.454 --> 01:36:29.544
Don't do it Bill!

01:36:30.124 --> 01:36:31.164
His name is Vallon!

01:37:04.075 --> 01:37:06.075
Curious people these celestials.

01:37:08.245 --> 01:37:09.835
You know why they use short
sleeves?

01:37:10.376 --> 01:37:12.416
So everyone can see he's got
nothing stashed.

01:37:13.046 --> 01:37:15.006
I hope it doesn't become a fashion.

01:37:22.516 --> 01:37:23.016
Johnny?

01:38:01.637 --> 01:38:02.307
Get up!

01:38:18.358 --> 01:38:23.408
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have
your kind attention.

01:38:23.408 --> 01:38:25.828
As some of you have surely
noticed...

01:38:26.288 --> 01:38:29.958
...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting...

01:38:30.378 --> 01:38:36.258
..is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction!

01:38:41.098 --> 01:38:44.638
May we appeal to him, to favour us...

01:38:44.638 --> 01:38:47.058
...with another exciting exhibition.

01:38:47.558 --> 01:38:53.729
Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!

01:39:13.839 --> 01:39:14.709
What's gonna happen?

01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:44.660
The spider's kiss!

01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:49.250
The wheel of death!

01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:50.960
William Tell!

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.040
The butterfly!

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.380
The spider's kiss!

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.500
The Butcher's apprentice!

01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.380
The Butcher's apprentice!

01:39:58.630 --> 01:40:00.881
A command performance!

01:40:03.141 --> 01:40:04.051
Where have you been?

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:06.681
A command performance indeed.

01:40:07.181 --> 01:40:08.141
I want you to get out of here!

01:40:08.721 --> 01:40:11.851
And for this, I must beg the
indulgence...

01:40:11.851 --> 01:40:12.771
...of my former...

01:40:12.771 --> 01:40:15.061
... assistent in matters of impailment...

01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:18.611
...the Butcher's original apprentice.

01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:21.821
What do you say, Jen?

01:40:22.201 --> 01:40:24.451
One more time for the
sweet souvenir.

01:40:25.871 --> 01:40:26.331
Come on!

01:40:36.922 --> 01:40:38.342
Don't do it!

01:40:50.852 --> 01:40:51.932
She'll be alright.

01:40:55.732 --> 01:40:56.612
Remember this?

01:40:56.772 --> 01:40:57.232
Of course!

01:41:07.532 --> 01:41:11.453
You may feel more comfortable without
that garment, Miss Everdeane!

01:41:13.753 --> 01:41:15.753
You'll have to filch me a
new one, Bill!

01:41:30.223 --> 01:41:32.183
Anything in your pockets tonight?

01:41:32.933 --> 01:41:34.813
I ain't started working yet.

01:41:38.403 --> 01:41:40.573
What about that locket I
gave you?

01:41:56.624 --> 01:41:58.964
Apologies my dear. Pick it up.

01:42:04.724 --> 01:42:06.184
Whoopsie daisy!

01:42:08.764 --> 01:42:10.304
Now its good and broke!

01:42:11.974 --> 01:42:14.064
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

01:42:22.325 --> 01:42:25.195
You got the sand to give 'm a
grand finale?

01:42:34.455 --> 01:42:36.625
Maybe when you're aiming a
little straighter.

01:42:47.515 --> 01:42:49.095
Enough of this heathen music.

01:42:50.055 --> 01:42:52.016
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.

01:42:52.226 --> 01:42:53.146
Strike up boys!

01:42:54.816 --> 01:42:57.486
This is a night for Americans!

01:43:06.036 --> 01:43:06.536
Jenny!

01:44:03.468 --> 01:44:04.428
Hats off!

01:44:11.888 --> 01:44:15.818
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

01:44:17.018 --> 01:44:19.398
...whose blood stains the very streets...

01:44:19.398 --> 01:44:20.698
...we walk today.

01:44:22.318 --> 01:44:27.538
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies.

01:44:29.698 --> 01:44:31.408
An honourable man...

01:44:32.458 --> 01:44:36.419
...who crossed over bravely.
Fighting for what he believed in.

01:44:43.799 --> 01:44:47.559
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish
his life...

01:44:48.509 --> 01:44:51.179
... and consume him as I consume
these flames.

01:44:53.809 --> 01:44:55.689
In honour of Priest Vallon.

01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:59.109
In honour of Priest Vallon!

01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:06.119
That's a wound !

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.500
I want you all to meet the son of
Priest Vallon.

01:45:20.710 --> 01:45:22.420
I took him under my wing...

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.130
...and see how I'm repaid.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.720
He saved my life one day so he
could kill me the next...

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.180
...like a sneak thief.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.180
Instead of fighting like a man.

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:37.940
A base defiler. Unworthy of
a noble name.

01:45:51.491 --> 01:45:53.411
That'll do Mcgloin.
Spread him out.

01:45:55.831 --> 01:45:59.211
I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.

01:46:05.931 --> 01:46:07.471
This is fresh meat!

01:46:10.011 --> 01:46:12.061
We need to tenderise this meat
a bit.

01:46:13.521 --> 01:46:16.692
Alright, lets kiss goodnight to
that pretty face of yours!

01:46:27.612 --> 01:46:28.612
No...!

01:46:30.912 --> 01:46:35.082
What'll it be then. Rib or chop.
Loin or shank.

01:46:35.082 --> 01:46:35.542
The liver!

01:46:35.542 --> 01:46:36.042
The spleen!

01:46:37.372 --> 01:46:37.922
The kidney!

01:46:45.052 --> 01:46:45.552
The lung!

01:46:45.882 --> 01:46:46.422
The liver!

01:46:47.342 --> 01:46:47.802
The tongue!

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.683
The heart! The heart!

01:46:51.683 --> 01:46:52.853
The heart?

01:46:53.183 --> 01:46:54.773
This boy has no heart.

01:46:54.773 --> 01:46:57.233
Then kill him!

01:47:02.693 --> 01:47:04.363
He ain't earned the death!

01:47:04.783 --> 01:47:07.113
He ain't earned the death of
my hands!

01:47:09.113 --> 01:47:12.073
He'll walk amongst you marked
with shame.

01:47:12.073 --> 01:47:16.793
A freak. Worthy of Barnum's
museum of wonders.

01:47:17.833 --> 01:47:21.503
God's only man, speared by
the Butcher.

01:48:00.835 --> 01:48:03.835
Here. Here. This way.

01:48:03.835 --> 01:48:04.675
Come on.

01:48:51.596 --> 01:48:53.186
I want to show you something.

01:48:59.066 --> 01:49:00.856
My mother's bones share this
grave.

01:49:03.946 --> 01:49:06.947
I've saved 20 cents out of every
dollar I've ever earned since ....

01:49:06.947 --> 01:49:07.987
...I was thirteen.

01:49:10.867 --> 01:49:12.577
That's 215 dollars.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.417
For bludgeoning and the rest.

01:49:20.337 --> 01:49:22.717
This is what I wanted to show you.

01:49:24.717 --> 01:49:27.387
This is where we're going to go,
as soon as you get better....

01:49:27.887 --> 01:49:31.427
...San Fransisco, California.

01:49:34.097 --> 01:49:36.017
You can have anything you want
out there.

01:49:37.767 --> 01:49:40.938
These men are pulling gold right
out of the river.

01:49:41.438 --> 01:49:42.608
With their own hands.

01:49:44.988 --> 01:49:48.568
We're here and need to get there.

01:49:50.528 --> 01:49:51.618
Start here.

01:49:52.698 --> 01:49:55.328
Go down 'round here.

01:49:58.208 --> 01:49:59.498
Up to San Francisco.

01:50:02.338 --> 01:50:03.588
The shortest way to go.

01:50:05.378 --> 01:50:06.548
Will you go with me?

01:50:32.239 --> 01:50:34.909
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

01:50:36.579 --> 01:50:38.869
An audience with yor mangled
friend is all I want.

01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:57.480
I've 44 notches on my club.

01:50:59.690 --> 01:51:00.940
Do you know what they are for?

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.690
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.580
My father was killed in battle too.

01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:19.080
In Ireland, in the streets.

01:51:22.041 --> 01:51:23.961
Fighting those who were taking
their privilege.

01:51:24.841 --> 01:51:26.381
What only could be got and held...

01:51:26.381 --> 01:51:28.171
...by the decimation of a race.

01:51:29.881 --> 01:51:32.091
That war is a thousand years old
and more.

01:51:34.061 --> 01:51:35.811
We never expected it to follow
us here.

01:51:38.771 --> 01:51:39.391
It didn't.

01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:42.401
It was waiting for us when
we landed.

01:51:47.231 --> 01:51:50.491
Your father tried to carve out a
corner in this country for his tribe.

01:51:53.491 --> 01:51:55.081
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.

01:51:59.292 --> 01:52:01.542
I often wondered, if he'd lived a
bit longer...

01:52:03.672 --> 01:52:05.382
...would he have wanted it to
be more.

01:52:17.642 --> 01:52:19.812
Why did you rifle through his
pockets then?

01:52:38.083 --> 01:52:39.333
For safekeeping.

01:52:43.463 --> 01:52:44.753
I thought maybe you could do
with it.

01:53:07.824 --> 01:53:09.484
Blood stays on the blade.

01:54:27.066 --> 01:54:28.906
That's a sorry looking pelt.

01:54:33.946 --> 01:54:37.156
And it's been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

01:54:40.076 --> 01:54:43.086
Tell me, this charge. Does it sit
on easy with you?

01:54:44.916 --> 01:54:49.467
No. Not uneasy , Bill.

01:54:51.137 --> 01:54:52.757
I wouldn't say that.

01:54:55.597 --> 01:54:59.937
But... my allegiance is
to the law.

01:55:01.937 --> 01:55:03.937
I'm paid to uphold the law.

01:55:20.418 --> 01:55:22.788
What in heaven's name are you
talking about?

01:55:28.128 --> 01:55:32.548
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing
that, Jack. That way lies damnation.

01:55:36.888 --> 01:55:38.728
I'm in no danger of
damnation, Bill.

01:55:51.108 --> 01:55:52.278
Here's the thing.

01:55:54.579 --> 01:55:57.789
I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...

01:55:57.789 --> 01:55:59.249
..you meatheaded shit sack.

01:56:01.869 --> 01:56:03.419
That's more or less the thing.

01:56:05.959 --> 01:56:08.669
I want you to go out there. You
and nobody else.

01:56:09.379 --> 01:56:10.509
None of your little minions.

01:56:10.509 --> 01:56:12.129
I want you to go out there...

01:56:13.889 --> 01:56:15.099
...and I want you...

01:56:16.889 --> 01:56:20.269
...to punish, the person...

01:56:20.979 --> 01:56:22.769
...who's responsible...

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:29.360
...for murdering this poor
little rabbit.

01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:37.580
Is that understood?

01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:43.080
Right!

01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:48.090
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

01:57:26.131 --> 01:57:26.631
Damn it!

01:57:29.501 --> 01:57:30.631
Is that you, boy?

01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:35.131
I didn't mean nothing by that shot
you know?

01:57:36.762 --> 01:57:38.142
You scared me is all.

01:57:41.642 --> 01:57:43.812
You know I'd never do you harm.

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:46.772
Come out now, lad.

01:57:50.022 --> 01:57:51.732
Remember your father and me?

01:57:55.862 --> 01:57:58.622
Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?

01:58:01.242 --> 01:58:03.042
The times we had.

01:58:09.752 --> 01:58:11.133
You know I won't hurt you.

01:58:44.333 --> 01:58:45.584
This is bad for everybody.

01:58:45.584 --> 01:58:47.334
What's next, dead politicians?

01:58:49.674 --> 01:58:51.844
I could spare half a dozen
of you...

01:58:52.504 --> 01:58:53.924
...easier than I can spare him.

01:58:55.594 --> 01:58:58.594
Still, I think it shows dash.

01:58:59.594 --> 01:59:02.474
Give the boy some time, we'll
settle with a good dust up.

01:59:35.055 --> 01:59:36.015
The lads!

01:59:46.935 --> 01:59:49.735
There are more of us coming off
the ships each day.

01:59:50.985 --> 01:59:53.116
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

01:59:55.736 --> 01:59:57.326
And we're afraid of the Natives!

02:00:00.206 --> 02:00:01.366
Get all of us together...

02:00:01.366 --> 02:00:02.706
....we ain't got a gang..

02:00:03.126 --> 02:00:04.126
...we got an army.

02:00:04.746 --> 02:00:09.086
And all we need is a spark. One
spark, to wake us all up.

02:00:27.147 --> 02:00:28.477
It was me who played you false.

02:00:31.237 --> 02:00:32.607
I'd take it back if I could.

02:00:32.607 --> 02:00:33.817
Take it back?

02:00:38.407 --> 02:00:39.907
Johnny, I ought to kill you!

02:00:54.797 --> 02:00:56.927
Get out of the Points and
don't come back.

02:01:05.688 --> 02:01:06.728
Where are you going, boil?

02:01:08.978 --> 02:01:09.648
Come along.

02:01:10.778 --> 02:01:11.358
Come on.

02:01:14.908 --> 02:01:16.698
Tell us John, what's the trouble?

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:19.908
No trouble, Bill.

02:01:23.498 --> 02:01:25.168
Still hiding out with
your friends?

02:01:29.168 --> 02:01:32.838
No, I'm not with them, Bill.

02:01:34.088 --> 02:01:36.429
I'm with you, with the Natives.

02:01:41.719 --> 02:01:44.979
You always were a Native, as far
as I'm interested, John.

02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:50.069
Till you became a stag.

02:01:54.739 --> 02:01:56.449
You tell me you're a Native?

02:01:56.449 --> 02:01:57.739
Do you want to know what
a Native is?

02:02:00.369 --> 02:02:05.829
A Native is a man, who's
willing to give his life...

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:08.289
...for his country.

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:12.210
Like my father done.

02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:18.640
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

02:02:28.730 --> 02:02:30.400
John? Johnny?

02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:40.280
Johnny?

02:02:50.751 --> 02:02:51.461
I'll get you off.

02:03:05.391 --> 02:03:06.891
It hurts too much.

02:03:14.191 --> 02:03:15.231
Just kill me.

02:03:20.952 --> 02:03:22.242
Just kill me.

02:03:24.912 --> 02:03:26.912
Please. Please.

02:03:33.792 --> 02:03:36.132
Please. Please.

02:03:40.182 --> 02:03:40.802
Please.

02:03:46.312 --> 02:03:47.482
I'm sorry, Johnny.

02:04:04.663 --> 02:04:06.793
Oh, Mary mother of God, pray
for us sinners...

02:04:06.793 --> 02:04:08.753
...on the day of our death...amen.

02:04:10.873 --> 02:04:12.213
Rest in peace, Ma.

02:04:15.883 --> 02:04:17.053
What are you doing here, boil?

02:04:24.763 --> 02:04:26.934
What's that nigger doing in
this church?

02:04:32.274 --> 02:04:34.404
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with
the Natives,huh?

02:04:34.404 --> 02:04:36.074
No niggers among the Natives.

02:04:36.074 --> 02:04:37.574
Niggers as robbers is
one thing...

02:04:37.574 --> 02:04:40.034
...but niggers in a church,
that's something else!

02:04:40.784 --> 02:04:42.154
You run with the Natives, you go
pray with the Natives!

02:04:42.154 --> 02:04:44.704
You're going to wind up on a stake
like your man did!

02:04:45.534 --> 02:04:46.124
McGloin?

02:04:47.454 --> 02:04:50.834
Father! Jezus, do you know there's
a nigger in your church?

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:11.145
Jezus!

02:05:34.966 --> 02:05:36.136
The earth turns...

02:05:38.136 --> 02:05:39.886
...but we don't feel it move.

02:05:43.516 --> 02:05:45.186
And one night you look up...

02:05:47.396 --> 02:05:51.896
...one spark and the skie's on fire.

02:06:03.996 --> 02:06:05.666
It's a touching spectacle.

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:10.587
We'll come back when you're
ready for us.

02:06:17.967 --> 02:06:20.387
The past is the torch that
lights our way.

02:06:21.967 --> 02:06:23.887
Where our fathers have shown
us the path.

02:06:25.057 --> 02:06:26.307
We shall follow.

02:06:29.187 --> 02:06:32.357
Our faith is the weapon most
feared by our enemies...

02:06:33.567 --> 02:06:35.697
...for thereby shall we lift our
people up...

02:06:35.697 --> 02:06:37.777
...against those who will
destroy us.

02:06:38.817 --> 02:06:43.198
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits,
to remind all of our suffering...

02:06:43.868 --> 02:06:46.208
...and as a call to those who
suffer still...

02:06:46.208 --> 02:06:47.618
...to join our ranks.

02:06:48.078 --> 02:06:52.838
However so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:56.838
For with great numbers, must come
great strength.

02:06:57.678 --> 02:06:59.468
For the salvation of our people.

02:07:01.298 --> 02:07:02.218
We don't want your business.

02:07:02.218 --> 02:07:03.058
How many other men live here?

02:07:03.508 --> 02:07:04.388
You all have to register.

02:07:04.388 --> 02:07:06.178
You can't force me to join
no army.

02:07:06.558 --> 02:07:07.438
Have you got 300 dollars?

02:07:07.438 --> 02:07:07.978
Of course not!

02:07:07.978 --> 02:07:09.398
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

02:07:09.398 --> 02:07:12.398
If you are drafted, release from militairy
service can only be secured...

02:07:12.768 --> 02:07:15.278
...for 300 dollars, according to
the conscription act.

02:07:15.278 --> 02:07:15.859
300 Dollars?

02:07:15.859 --> 02:07:17.109
Otherwise you have to serve!

02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:18.569
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

02:07:18.569 --> 02:07:19.319
You have to serve, sir!

02:07:19.319 --> 02:07:19.949
You tell me!

02:07:21.869 --> 02:07:22.449
Boys!

02:07:24.579 --> 02:07:26.829
I was born here, sir. You
immigrated here!

02:07:28.659 --> 02:07:31.209
Sweet jezus. War does terrible
things to men.

02:07:31.879 --> 02:07:33.459
Get back up town, where you
belong!

02:07:33.459 --> 02:07:36.259
300 dollars. It's another rich
man's war!

02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:40.129
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

02:07:42.849 --> 02:07:44.639
Don't they speak English in
New York anymore!

02:07:45.139 --> 02:07:46.349
Don't understand.

02:07:46.349 --> 02:07:47.389
You do speak English!

02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:53.690
I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle
her rifle in another direction?

02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:02.700
I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the value of this sort of publicity?

02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:10.040
The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder
with half the Irish in the Five Points.

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.630
I'm offering my boy, to form an
alliance with you...

02:08:14.630 --> 02:08:17.340
...against Bill Cutting and his
slate of Native candidates.

02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:21.180
I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for
every Irish vote...

02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.761
...you send Tammany's way, in the
coming elections.

02:08:26.311 --> 02:08:28.311
I need a new friend in the Five
Points, son.

02:08:32.651 --> 02:08:34.021
I'd like that friend to
be you.

02:08:38.361 --> 02:08:40.071
Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

02:08:41.111 --> 02:08:43.031
Suppose we do get you those votes.

02:08:46.621 --> 02:08:49.081
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my chosing..

02:08:49.081 --> 02:08:49.791
I don't think so.

02:08:49.791 --> 02:08:51.461
What if we get you all the
Irish votes?

02:08:51.461 --> 02:08:55.081
Mr. Vallon, that will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick!

02:08:58.052 --> 02:08:58.882
Beg your pardon?

02:08:58.882 --> 02:09:00.212
That means it will never happen.

02:09:00.212 --> 02:09:02.932
Now I might be persuaded to back
an Irish candidate...

02:09:02.932 --> 02:09:04.052
...for, let's say alderman.

02:09:04.052 --> 02:09:04.432
Alderman?

02:09:04.892 --> 02:09:06.892
We've already got an Irish
alderman.

02:09:06.892 --> 02:09:07.812
So we have, that's why....

02:09:07.812 --> 02:09:09.182
What's bigger than an alderman?

02:09:11.892 --> 02:09:12.602
Sheriff!

02:09:13.522 --> 02:09:14.272
Sheriff!

02:09:14.602 --> 02:09:17.772
Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an
Irishman for sheriff...

02:09:17.772 --> 02:09:19.572
...of the city and county of
New York...

02:09:19.572 --> 02:09:21.572
...and we'll get him elected.

02:09:21.572 --> 02:09:22.742
I love the Irish, son...

02:09:22.742 --> 02:09:24.992
..but higher than alderman you
shall never climb.

02:09:24.992 --> 02:09:25.782
Why not?

02:09:26.412 --> 02:09:29.242
For one thing, no man living can
consolidate the Irish vote.

02:09:29.242 --> 02:09:29.702
I can!

02:09:29.702 --> 02:09:31.332
And for another, I mean no
offence...

02:09:32.003 --> 02:09:33.503
...no one's yet found an Irish
candidate...

02:09:33.503 --> 02:09:35.043
...for sheriff worth voting for.

02:09:38.713 --> 02:09:39.213
Monk!

02:09:41.013 --> 02:09:41.423
Here.

02:09:46.973 --> 02:09:49.393
Got me looking as sober as me own
grandfather!

02:09:49.393 --> 02:09:50.773
He was a great man, I'm sure.

02:09:51.223 --> 02:09:52.933
He was a drunken bastard.

02:09:56.023 --> 02:09:57.193
Can I say what I want?

02:09:58.943 --> 02:10:00.233
That's why I wanted you.

02:10:01.483 --> 02:10:04.403
Our elected representatives are a
gang of thieves!

02:10:04.403 --> 02:10:06.074
Who swear to better our lot...

02:10:06.574 --> 02:10:08.454
...while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

02:10:08.954 --> 02:10:13.664
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

02:10:13.664 --> 02:10:17.754
....against any, an all in roads in
our democracy.

02:10:17.754 --> 02:10:19.504
I'll see to it, that no one
takes away...

02:10:19.884 --> 02:10:22.054
... what you earned by pluck and application.

02:10:22.054 --> 02:10:24.384
To invading hordes of Hibernians.

02:10:24.344 --> 02:10:26.184
Go to the polls and put
your mark...

02:10:26.514 --> 02:10:28.554
... next to the name Walter McGinn.

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:31.224
Against the potatoes weeders, like
them over there...

02:10:31.814 --> 02:10:33.224
...thieving our jobs.

02:10:33.224 --> 02:10:35.894
Why should so many Irish die down
south...

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:37.024
...when the first war to win...

02:10:37.024 --> 02:10:39.154
...is not down in Dixie, but
right here...

02:10:39.154 --> 02:10:40.195
...in these streets!

02:10:42.905 --> 02:10:44.945
Who's the finest streetfighter in
the Five Points?

02:10:45.365 --> 02:10:46.325
Monk!

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:49.625
That's right and let the whole
damn city hear it!

02:10:52.085 --> 02:10:53.835
That man was right born for this.

02:10:53.835 --> 02:10:56.915
He's killed 44 men and laid low a
couple of hundred more.

02:10:57.165 --> 02:10:58.375
Is that right?

02:10:58.375 --> 02:10:58.795
Right.

02:10:59.135 --> 02:11:00.505
I should have run him for mayor!

02:11:03.215 --> 02:11:04.265
Alright, line 'm up.

02:11:04.765 --> 02:11:06.175
It's election day!

02:11:16.436 --> 02:11:17.816
Come on, you bastard. We need
your vote.

02:11:18.196 --> 02:11:20.106
Bastard? I fought for you
nigger...

02:11:20.446 --> 02:11:21.616
...I lost an arm for you!

02:11:21.616 --> 02:11:23.366
Well, that's a start. Come on.

02:11:23.366 --> 02:11:25.236
Rise and shine, rise and shine.

02:11:25.826 --> 02:11:28.996
This great country of ours, even
hop fiends get their vote.

02:11:30.246 --> 02:11:32.166
Less heart and more haste,
darling.

02:11:32.166 --> 02:11:33.166
Where are you going ?

02:11:33.166 --> 02:11:34.586
I already voted today.

02:11:34.916 --> 02:11:37.126
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!

02:11:37.376 --> 02:11:38.006
Twice.

02:11:38.006 --> 02:11:38.666
Twice?

02:11:38.966 --> 02:11:40.926
Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty?

02:11:41.136 --> 02:11:41.886
Come with me.

02:11:42.216 --> 02:11:44.466
Oh no, you don't. Get back and
sit down.

02:11:44.806 --> 02:11:46.136
Here's another one!

02:11:46.306 --> 02:11:47.016
Clean him up good.

02:11:47.016 --> 02:11:49.937
Shave the beards off boys and send
them back to vote again.

02:11:49.937 --> 02:11:51.767
Okay boys, vote Tammany.

02:11:51.977 --> 02:11:53.147
Tammany!

02:11:53.147 --> 02:11:56.277
What our great city needs is a new
court house.

02:11:56.277 --> 02:11:59.107
Now I propose it should be a
modest, economical structure.

02:11:59.107 --> 02:12:00.197
Excuse me one moment.

02:12:00.197 --> 02:12:00.607
What is it?

02:12:01.157 --> 02:12:04.987
Monk's already won by 3,000 more
votes, then there are voters.

02:12:04.987 --> 02:12:06.577
Only 3? Make it 20, 30.

02:12:06.577 --> 02:12:08.657
We don't need a victory, we need a
Roman triumph.

02:12:08.657 --> 02:12:10.617
We don't have anymore ballots.

02:12:11.167 --> 02:12:13.037
Remember the first rule of
politics...

02:12:13.037 --> 02:12:14.537
...ballots don't make the results...

02:12:14.537 --> 02:12:17.507
..the counters do. Keep counting.

02:12:49.748 --> 02:12:50.748
It's from Bill.

02:12:55.038 --> 02:12:55.538
Monk?

02:13:16.309 --> 02:13:18.319
Citizens of the Five Points!

02:13:19.859 --> 02:13:22.319
Mr. Cutting is attempting to
draw me...

02:13:22.319 --> 02:13:23.449
...into an argument...

02:13:23.949 --> 02:13:25.569
...that would no doubt end in
bloodshed...

02:13:25.569 --> 02:13:27.619
...and the compromising of my
office.

02:13:29.159 --> 02:13:30.240
What do you think?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.370
Shall I engage in silence, this
relic of the ancient law...

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.000
...or, shall I be your chosen
voice...

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.090
...in a new testament, in a new
world?

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:49.260
There you are, Bill.

02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:52.930
The people have spoken.

02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:58.230
The very notion of violent
reprisal benumbs them.

02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:02.070
Come on up.

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:04.701
Let's see if we can resolve our...

02:14:04.701 --> 02:14:06.071
...grievances the democratic way.

02:14:30.511 --> 02:14:34.231
That my friends, is the minority
vote.

02:14:36.271 --> 02:14:38.982
Now you tasted my mutton, how do
you like it?

02:14:40.562 --> 02:14:43.362
Look, I want you to see this.

02:14:47.412 --> 02:14:49.202
This is you, right here!

02:14:49.702 --> 02:14:53.292
Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.

02:15:04.962 --> 02:15:06.052
Why don't you burn him?

02:15:06.052 --> 02:15:07.882
See if his ashes turn green.

02:15:13.853 --> 02:15:15.813
Fortune favours them all!

02:15:29.073 --> 02:15:30.613
You killed an elected official?

02:15:31.743 --> 02:15:32.873
Who elected him?

02:15:32.873 --> 02:15:34.543
You don't know what you've done
to yourself.

02:15:41.633 --> 02:15:42.923
I know your works.

02:15:44.713 --> 02:15:46.464
You're neither cold nor hot.

02:15:47.094 --> 02:15:49.094
So because you are luke warm...

02:15:49.094 --> 02:15:51.184
...I will spew you out of my
mouth.

02:15:53.054 --> 02:15:55.644
You can build your filthy world
without me.

02:15:55.644 --> 02:15:58.314
I took the father, now I'll take
the son.

02:15:58.314 --> 02:16:00.904
You tell young Vallon, I'm going
to paint...

02:16:00.904 --> 02:16:02.734
...Paradise square with his blood.

02:16:03.234 --> 02:16:04.574
Two coats!

02:16:05.784 --> 02:16:08.194
I'll festoon my sleeping
chamber with his guts.

02:16:08.194 --> 02:16:10.614
As for you Mr. Tammany
fucking hall...

02:16:10.614 --> 02:16:13.074
...you come down to the Points
once more...

02:16:13.074 --> 02:16:15.994
...and you'll be dispatched by my
own hand!

02:16:18.624 --> 02:16:19.834
Now get back to your
celebration...

02:16:19.834 --> 02:16:21.465
...and let me eat in peace.

02:16:21.465 --> 02:16:22.585
I paid you fair.

02:16:47.905 --> 02:16:48.405
Down!

02:16:50.405 --> 02:16:50.825
Raise!

02:17:35.037 --> 02:17:36.037
You son of a bitch!

02:17:41.166 --> 02:17:41.757
Challenge.

02:17:44.507 --> 02:17:45.547
Challenge accepted.

02:18:38.558 --> 02:18:39.728
And then it came...

02:18:40.689 --> 02:18:42.318
...the first day of the draft.

02:18:42.318 --> 02:18:43.068
Thomas O'neill.

02:18:44.279 --> 02:18:45.109
Andrew Lewis.

02:18:46.609 --> 02:18:47.659
Joseph Flynn.

02:18:47.659 --> 02:18:51.029
They read out the draftees names
as if they were dead already.

02:18:53.079 --> 02:18:54.409
J.B. Gleeson.

02:18:55.829 --> 02:18:56.579
The O'Conell Guard.

02:18:57.539 --> 02:18:58.249
The Plug Uglies.

02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.999
As for us.

02:18:58.999 --> 02:18:59.829
The Forty Thieves.

02:18:59.999 --> 02:19:00.999
The tribes were gathered.

02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.919
The Chichesters.

02:19:02.919 --> 02:19:04.259
The drums were beating.

02:19:04.799 --> 02:19:05.549
The Dead Rabbits.

02:19:06.339 --> 02:19:07.299
The American guard.

02:19:08.049 --> 02:19:09.049
The Atlantic Guard.

02:19:09.388 --> 02:19:10.468
The Slaughterhouses.

02:19:10.468 --> 02:19:11.760
The Bowery Boys.

02:19:12.219 --> 02:19:14.020
Confederation of American Natives.

02:19:16.059 --> 02:19:16.980
James Mooney.

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.690
But all we could see...

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.020
...was the hand in front of us.

02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:21.900
Shaun O'Connell.

02:19:23.650 --> 02:19:25.230
C.W. Morris.

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:28.240
When?

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:29.860
Whenever you like.

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.280
Daybreak tomorrow.

02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.240
Ground?

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:33.780
Paradise square.

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:35.700
Weapons?

02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:38.250
That I leave up to you.

02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:40.790
Bricks, bats, axes, knives.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.340
Pistols?

02:19:45.671 --> 02:19:46.671
No pistols.

02:19:47.921 --> 02:19:48.971
Good boy.

02:19:52.681 --> 02:19:53.761
Terms are resolved.

02:19:53.761 --> 02:19:54.851
Counsel is concluded.

02:20:02.021 --> 02:20:03.441
To hell with your damned draft.

02:20:03.811 --> 02:20:04.981
Get 'm boys.

02:20:04.981 --> 02:20:06.071
Rip 'm apart.

02:20:13.871 --> 02:20:15.331
Kill the rich bastards.

02:20:22.632 --> 02:20:23.542
Hotel!

02:20:25.802 --> 02:20:27.592
They're not getting my son!

02:20:33.222 --> 02:20:35.142
Uptown town at the draft office...

02:20:35.852 --> 02:20:37.892
...the cops broke a few skulls.

02:20:38.522 --> 02:20:40.062
And everybody ran away.

02:20:41.892 --> 02:20:43.522
But the word was spreading...

02:20:44.562 --> 02:20:45.902
...in the dark.

02:20:47.612 --> 02:20:50.992
Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns
and their mob...

02:20:50.992 --> 02:20:52.783
...breathed a little easy.

02:20:52.783 --> 02:20:55.913
Just a brief blist of anger, over
Mr. Lincoln's draft.

02:20:55.913 --> 02:20:57.743
Entirely justifiable in my view.

02:20:58.243 --> 02:20:59.703
There are two sides to that
question.

02:20:59.703 --> 02:21:02.293
Ther are several sides to that
question, Mr. Schermerhorn.

02:21:02.293 --> 02:21:03.923
But only one right side.

02:21:03.923 --> 02:21:06.133
As with any question, it
holds the abuse...

02:21:06.133 --> 02:21:07.173
...of any executive power.

02:21:07.173 --> 02:21:09.093
In any case, Mr. Greely...

02:21:09.093 --> 02:21:12.053
...we can all be thankful, it
wasn't any worse.

02:21:12.593 --> 02:21:14.263
It may be worse yet, sir.

02:21:14.263 --> 02:21:15.973
I saw them. I don't know
what to think...

02:21:15.973 --> 02:21:18.813
What is it you are so fond of
saying, Mr. Tweed?

02:21:18.813 --> 02:21:20.603
Mr. Greely, you won't like this...

02:21:20.603 --> 02:21:21.683
...but what is it?

02:21:21.683 --> 02:21:22.773
I don't remember.

02:21:22.773 --> 02:21:25.403
You can always hire one half
of the poor...

02:21:25.403 --> 02:21:26.944
...to kill the other half.

02:21:38.034 --> 02:21:39.374
I've come to say goodbye.

02:21:40.754 --> 02:21:42.624
I've booked passage for
California.

02:21:46.134 --> 02:21:48.254
Jenny, give me one more day and
I'll go with you.

02:21:49.054 --> 02:21:50.344
You'll be dead by then.

02:21:52.014 --> 02:21:53.264
What would you have me do?

02:21:53.264 --> 02:21:54.094
I don't know.

02:21:58.104 --> 02:21:59.604
This will all be finished
tomorrow.

02:22:00.064 --> 02:22:01.105
No it won't.

02:22:05.565 --> 02:22:07.655
This whole place is going to
burn anyway.

02:22:16.785 --> 02:22:20.165
I've heard of the poor are going
from door to door...

02:22:20.165 --> 02:22:24.625
...in the Five Points, asking those
supporters for further riots...

02:22:25.165 --> 02:22:27.335
...to place a candle in the
window.

02:22:28.795 --> 02:22:30.595
Irish, Poles, Germans.

02:22:31.675 --> 02:22:34.595
Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...

02:22:35.176 --> 02:22:37.556
...I prophesise a dark night.

02:23:00.326 --> 02:23:01.706
Nobody goes to work today.

02:23:02.036 --> 02:23:03.916
We're shutting the factories down!

02:23:03.916 --> 02:23:05.796
When the sun rose next...

02:23:06.216 --> 02:23:08.086
...the city had split in half.

02:23:08.716 --> 02:23:10.677
From all over New York
they came...

02:23:10.677 --> 02:23:13.387
...ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners!

02:23:13.387 --> 02:23:15.267
Irish, Polish, German...

02:23:15.267 --> 02:23:18.057
...anyone who never cared about
slavery in the Union.

02:23:18.597 --> 02:23:20.187
Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.

02:23:21.227 --> 02:23:22.357
Let the sons of the rich...

02:23:22.357 --> 02:23:23.857
....go and die they cried.

02:23:24.317 --> 02:23:25.647
Let the sons of the poor...

02:23:25.647 --> 02:23:26.857
...stay home.

02:23:28.527 --> 02:23:30.237
The earth was shaking now.

02:23:31.237 --> 02:23:33.447
But I was about my father's business.

02:23:48.548 --> 02:23:50.008
Oh, mighty Lord...

02:23:50.838 --> 02:23:53.008
...you are the dagger in
my hand.

02:23:54.138 --> 02:23:56.518
Guide my hand on this day of
vengeance.

02:23:56.518 --> 02:23:58.598
We give thanks to the Lord....

02:23:59.018 --> 02:24:00.558
...for He is good.

02:24:01.148 --> 02:24:03.438
With you, the swift cannot flee.

02:24:03.438 --> 02:24:05.358
Nor the strong escape.

02:24:05.358 --> 02:24:09.568
Let my sword devour, till its thirst
is quenched with blood....

02:24:09.568 --> 02:24:11.448
...and my enemy sleeps forever.

02:24:11.948 --> 02:24:14.238
For you and the God of
retribution.

02:24:14.238 --> 02:24:16.738
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

02:24:16.738 --> 02:24:18.579
The Lord is merciful.

02:24:20.289 --> 02:24:23.419
And his love endures forever.

02:24:24.499 --> 02:24:25.209
Amen.

02:24:25.209 --> 02:24:25.919
Amen.

02:24:25.919 --> 02:24:26.709
Amen.

02:24:40.059 --> 02:24:41.059
Get the women upstairs!

02:24:50.529 --> 02:24:52.660
From 18th precinct. The mob is
ransacking houses...

02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:54.370
....in 27th street and 7th
avenue.

02:24:54.370 --> 02:24:56.080
We have no force to send.

02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:57.160
From 15th precinct.

02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:59.330
All the stores are closing on
8th avenue.

02:24:59.330 --> 02:25:01.330
From fear of the mob in 17th
street.

02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.670
From 4th.

02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:09.000
The rioters are attacking
coloured boarding houses...

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.760
...robbing them and setting them
on fire.

02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:11.590
From 21st.

02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:13.550
The mob have just broken open
a gun store...

02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:15.550
...on 3rd avenue and are arming.

02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:25.481
Marshall's office on 3rd avenue
is burning down.

02:25:25.481 --> 02:25:26.861
The police is of no avail.

02:25:26.861 --> 02:25:28.151
Show yourself, please!

02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:30.071
Two coloured men brought in
almost dead.

02:25:30.071 --> 02:25:31.651
There are 50 more outside.

02:25:31.651 --> 02:25:32.531
They need help.

02:25:32.531 --> 02:25:34.281
The blacks are being attacked
all over the city.

02:25:34.281 --> 02:25:36.241
There's the 300 dollar man!

02:25:36.491 --> 02:25:36.951
Get him!

02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:39.291
Did your daddy buy you out of
the army!

02:25:39.581 --> 02:25:41.001
Can he buy me out of the
army too?

02:25:41.701 --> 02:25:43.661
There is danger of mob
attacking armoury...

02:25:43.661 --> 02:25:45.751
...corner 21st street, 2nd
avenue.

02:25:46.211 --> 02:25:48.091
There's about 500 stand of arms
in it.

02:25:54.801 --> 02:25:56.301
The line is dead. They're trying
to cut all the wires!

02:26:00.562 --> 02:26:01.062
From 1st.

02:26:01.352 --> 02:26:02.892
Riot at Pier 4, North River.

02:26:02.892 --> 02:26:04.272
They have killed negros there.

02:26:04.272 --> 02:26:06.522
A crowd is here and are going to
destroy the station.

02:26:10.442 --> 02:26:11.282
Get her bag!

02:26:11.652 --> 02:26:12.192
Get her bag!

02:26:14.532 --> 02:26:15.362
From 18th precinct.

02:26:15.822 --> 02:26:17.032
The mob have attacked the
armoury.

02:26:17.032 --> 02:26:18.412
...on 2nd avenue an 21st street.

02:26:18.412 --> 02:26:20.452
There is danger of fire in the
building.

02:26:20.742 --> 02:26:23.202
All 300 police wounded or
unaccounted for.

02:26:25.212 --> 02:26:25.622

02:26:31.712 --> 02:26:32.962
...set on fire by the mob.

02:26:34.343 --> 02:26:36.093
Barnum's American museum on
fire!

02:26:36.513 --> 02:26:37.473
Animals are escaping.

02:26:38.513 --> 02:26:39.683
Let go!

02:26:55.443 --> 02:26:59.283
Gunboat Liberty! An ironclad berth now
lying on the foot of Wall street.

02:26:59.283 --> 02:27:01.123
They're ready to open fire on
the mob!

02:27:01.123 --> 02:27:02.793
The mob are now going to 5th
avenue...

02:27:02.793 --> 02:27:04.293
....to attack the Tribune office.

02:27:05.003 --> 02:27:05.663
From 16th.

02:27:05.663 --> 02:27:07.333
The mob is coming down to
station house.

02:27:07.333 --> 02:27:08.214
We have no men!

02:27:09.674 --> 02:27:11.424
From 16th. The seventh regiment
has arrived....

02:27:11.424 --> 02:27:12.674
...on the foot of Canal street.

02:27:12.674 --> 02:27:13.844
They're on their way to
Bog Wade.

02:27:15.424 --> 02:27:17.054
The mob is about 4500 strong.

02:27:17.554 --> 02:27:18.844
They are going to burn down
Harlem Bridge.

02:27:19.344 --> 02:27:20.684
Harlem Bridge is to be torched!

02:27:21.434 --> 02:27:22.934
The rats have taken over
the city!

02:27:27.694 --> 02:27:30.694
From 21st. There's an attack on
the coloured people in 2nd avenue.

02:27:30.694 --> 02:27:32.774
There's a mob headed for the

02:27:32.774 --> 02:27:34.284
Send troops to protect the
children.

02:27:35.154 --> 02:27:38.034

have just killed a negro.

02:27:38.034 --> 02:27:38.704
There's a negro!

02:27:38.704 --> 02:27:39.534
Get him!

02:27:39.534 --> 02:27:41.324
Sir, the major general wants to
know what to do....

02:27:41.324 --> 02:27:41.875
...with the prisoners captured.

02:27:41.875 --> 02:27:42.785
Prisoners? Don't take any.

02:27:42.785 --> 02:27:44.295
The mob isn't taking any
prisoners!

02:27:44.745 --> 02:27:45.705
Put the mob down!

02:27:45.705 --> 02:27:48.585
Don't take a prisoner till
you've put the mob down!

02:27:56.055 --> 02:27:57.425
Soldiers now on 38th street.

02:27:57.885 --> 02:27:59.305
The mob will not disperse!

02:27:59.975 --> 02:28:00.935
What are your orders?

02:28:01.305 --> 02:28:02.515
What are your orders?

02:28:26.206 --> 02:28:26.546
Here the come!

02:28:29.416 --> 02:28:30.296
Let's stick together!

02:28:34.756 --> 02:28:36.306
Troop. Halt!

02:28:37.426 --> 02:28:39.346
Present arms!

02:28:45.686 --> 02:28:47.106
On your order, Vallon!

02:28:51.487 --> 02:28:53.947
I order you to disperse.

02:28:57.657 --> 02:28:58.907
Fire!

02:29:34.948 --> 02:29:36.408
Fire!

02:29:52.208 --> 02:29:53.088
Fire!

02:30:14.029 --> 02:30:15.359
Drive them into the square.

02:30:18.569 --> 02:30:19.579
Bill!

02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:33.510
Bill!

02:32:15.483 --> 02:32:16.363
Bastards!

02:32:16.363 --> 02:32:17.493
Shang!Hold on!

02:32:51.444 --> 02:32:53.274
Thank God.

02:32:54.484 --> 02:32:55.864
I die a true American.

02:34:59.567 --> 02:35:00.367
Tomorrow morning...

02:35:00.367 --> 02:35:01.987
...get our people down to
the docks.

02:35:02.697 --> 02:35:04.908
I want every man and woman
coming off the boats...

02:35:05.198 --> 02:35:06.788
...given hot soup and bread.

02:35:11.958 --> 02:35:14.508
We're burying a lot of votes
here tonight.

02:35:33.108 --> 02:35:34.188
In the end....

02:35:34.188 --> 02:35:36.068
...they put candles on the
bodies...

02:35:36.068 --> 02:35:38.899
...so their friends, if they
had any...

02:35:39.989 --> 02:35:41.569
...could know them in the dark.

02:35:43.329 --> 02:35:45.789
The city did this free
of charge.

02:35:47.869 --> 02:35:53.209
Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.
McGloin and more.

02:35:55.589 --> 02:35:57.129
Friend or foe...

02:35:57.759 --> 02:35:59.549
...it didn't make no difference
now.

02:36:19.650 --> 02:36:21.280
It was four days and nights...

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:24.410
..before the worst of the mob
was finally put down.

02:36:26.490 --> 02:36:28.950
We never knew how many New
Yorkers died...

02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:31.750
...that week, before the city
was finally delivered.

02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:37.630
My father told me we was all
born of blood and tribulation.

02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:43.300
And so then too, was our
great city.

02:36:46.971 --> 02:36:48.311
But for those of us who...

02:36:48.311 --> 02:36:50.851
...lived and died in them
furious days...

02:36:51.891 --> 02:36:53.731
...it was like everything we
knew...

02:36:54.231 --> 02:36:56.231
...was mildly swept away.

02:36:58.071 --> 02:37:01.491
And no matter what they did to
build this city up again...

02:37:03.451 --> 02:37:04.991
...for the rest of time...

02:37:07.158 --> 02:37:11.454
...it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.

02:37:12.305 --> 02:37:18.543
