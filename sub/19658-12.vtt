00:12.737 --> 00:14.096
I am Groot.

00:14.284 --> 00:15.612
Well, that's good news.

00:15.737 --> 00:18.800
Groot says this goop grenade's
heading straight for Spartax.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.745
My family is on Spartax, Rocket.

00:21.823 --> 00:25.456
How is being infested by vicious
ink creatures good news?

00:25.675 --> 00:27.769
I thought you hated
your dad, Quill.

00:27.886 --> 00:31.447
That doesn't mean I want my
sister and billions of people

00:31.542 --> 00:34.448

00:34.557 --> 00:38.128
Agreed. It would be an
inappropriate form of vengeance.

00:38.258 --> 00:40.581
Drax the Destroyer
knows vengeance.

00:40.675 --> 00:42.378

00:42.511 --> 00:44.144
Okay, look.
Here's an idea.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.573
What say we warn my baby sis about
the space parasite fastball

00:47.667 --> 00:49.683

she'd wanna know.

<i>About the Symbiote-infested

01:14.566 --> 01:16.358
We already tried that.

01:16.456 --> 01:20.456

rain down Symbiotes all over Spartax.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.667

01:31.581 --> 01:35.394
Why do people always say "no offense"
right before they offend you?

01:35.612 --> 01:38.972
More importantly, how do we
get Victoria's attention now?

01:39.011 --> 01:41.214

01:41.378 --> 01:42.518
You're right, Gamora,

a little louder.

02:20.245 --> 02:23.152
Look, we were trying to warn you
not to blow up that comet.

02:23.207 --> 02:27.699
The comet you created by blowing up an
entire planet, if my intel is accurate?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.449
Well, does your "intel" mention
that comet is full of...

02:30.559 --> 02:34.102
Space parasites that turn people
into feral rage monsters.

02:34.138 --> 02:37.074
I know what Symbiotes are, Peter.
Okay, so you know then

02:37.141 --> 02:41.310
that the only things that even slow 'em down
are electricity, sound, and massive heat.

02:41.345 --> 02:43.364
Blowing up, not so much.

02:43.401 --> 02:46.180
If even a fragment of that
comet lands on Spartax...

02:46.217 --> 02:48.348

nearly in range.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.539
What are your orders?

02:54.358 --> 02:57.246
Tell the fleet to fall back and
everyone aboard to abandon ship.

02:57.283 --> 02:58.559

Say what now?

02:58.596 --> 03:03.250

They are. Take one and evacuate.
I have an empire to save.

03:25.923 --> 03:28.727
So how do you save an empire
with no one else on the ship?

03:28.868 --> 03:31.180
By deliberately smashing
this ship into the comet.

03:31.274 --> 03:34.509
- Why are you still aboard?
- [laughs] I'm sorry.

You were right, Peter.
Blowing it up won't work.

04:03.414 --> 04:06.344
But the fuel on this ship
should bring enough massive heat

to incinerate every last
Symbiote on that comet.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.742
What about the part where
we incinerate with it?

other side with a tractor beam?

11:58.620 --> 12:00.879
through a thousand Symbiotes.

12:01.168 --> 12:03.389
I approve of this plan.

12:03.933 --> 12:06.324
Sarcasm is not a plan!

12:06.426 --> 12:08.176
But it is our only shot.

12:08.304 --> 12:11.551
I'll go with him.
I am Groot!

12:11.871 --> 12:13.324
Force Shield Generators.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.668
Huh. Now, that's a plan.

12:20.684 --> 12:22.340
<i>[Rocket]
My Force Shield Generators</i>

12:22.377 --> 12:24.293
<i>will stop the inkblots
from bonding with ya.</i>

12:24.374 --> 12:26.856
<i>But it won't stop 'em
from grabbin', slashin',</i>

12:26.973 --> 12:28.579
<i>beatin', stabbin', and...</i>

12:28.616 --> 12:30.511
[Gamora]
We get the picture, Rocket.

12:30.586 --> 12:32.965
<i>Once you're inside,
we'll lose radio contact.</i>

12:33.021 --> 12:36.496
<i>Then you'll have exactly 15
minutes to flip those shields</i>

12:36.675 --> 12:39.237
<i>before we start zappin'.</i>

12:41.362 --> 12:43.529
[growling]

12:49.470 --> 12:52.970
So here's my plan. We get to the
engine room, overload the engines,

12:53.024 --> 12:55.946
and let the electricity vaporize
the Symbiotes on the ship's hull.

12:56.172 --> 12:57.938
You know how to do that?

12:58.165 --> 13:01.547
I saw Rocket do something like it once.
How hard could it be, right?

13:01.634 --> 13:05.884
Hard enough that botching it could
get us both electrocuted, Peter.

13:05.954 --> 13:09.759
You were gonna ram us straight
into the sun! How is that better?

13:09.876 --> 13:14.845
Because I didn't give in to my base
survival instincts. I'm not like Father!

13:14.892 --> 13:18.048
Wait. You did all this just
to prove you're not like Dad?

13:18.134 --> 13:20.696
J'Son taught me everything
I know about ruling,

13:20.829 --> 13:23.425
and then he betrayed us all
for his own selfish ends.

13:23.564 --> 13:27.126
I swore I'd never put myself above
the people I was born to protect,

13:27.216 --> 13:30.196
even if it means
risking my life.

13:30.344 --> 13:32.681
But I never wanted it
to cost you yours.

13:32.837 --> 13:36.501
Well, for what it's worth, sis,
I think you're a great ruler.

13:36.704 --> 13:39.351
That's why I want you to stick around.
[hissing, growling]

13:41.445 --> 13:42.649
[roars]

13:42.694 --> 13:43.958
[grunts]

13:46.327 --> 13:48.226
[grunts]

13:51.260 --> 13:54.060
[both grunting]

13:56.759 --> 13:58.946
Get to the engine
and start the overload!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.631
Right!

14:01.462 --> 14:02.930
[beeping]

14:03.079 --> 14:04.510
Mm, mm...

14:05.069 --> 14:06.934
Mmm...

14:07.971 --> 14:09.737
Mmm...

14:11.548 --> 14:14.712
Peter, now!
[grunts]

14:15.623 --> 14:18.134
[screeching, roaring]

14:18.962 --> 14:23.579
Okay, I actually don't know
how to overload the engines.

14:23.718 --> 14:26.238
I just wanted to buy time for the
Guardians to come and save us.

14:26.313 --> 14:29.227
And maybe give you a teeny-weeny
bit of hope, you know?

14:29.337 --> 14:32.516
But they are not coming, and
for that, I'm sorry. [yells]

14:32.673 --> 14:34.852
Peter!
[grunting]

14:44.652 --> 14:47.564
[Drax] I believe the phrase
is "You are welcome."

14:47.839 --> 14:50.422
You really thought
we weren't coming?

14:52.245 --> 14:54.151
Ha! Of course I did.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.566
Just making your entrance
more dramatic.

14:57.886 --> 15:00.683
Regardless of the level
of drama, we have a plan.

15:00.956 --> 15:02.573
You must turn
your ship's shields inward

15:02.636 --> 15:04.613
while we electrify
the common surface.

15:04.747 --> 15:06.646
That I can do.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.676
I am Groot!

15:15.011 --> 15:17.300
<i>[Spartaxian officer] Cannons
charged to full capacity.</i>

15:17.378 --> 15:19.552
<i>Awaiting your orders, General.</i>

15:20.050 --> 15:21.905
Guardians of the Galaxy,

15:21.948 --> 15:24.949
the comet is approaching
Spartax orbital range.

15:25.159 --> 15:28.105
I suggest you get out
of the line of fire.

15:28.378 --> 15:31.295
I was gonna suggest
you do the same thing, Gloggy,

15:31.464 --> 15:34.714
'cause this is gonna be one
krutackin' huge light show!

15:50.069 --> 15:52.397
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- I am Groot!

15:53.708 --> 15:56.843
[hissing, growling]

15:59.365 --> 16:02.294
Wait. I...
I just need a bigger zap!

16:02.467 --> 16:05.576
[beeping]

16:05.811 --> 16:08.534
<i>A very entertaining light show,
Guardians,</i>

16:08.670 --> 16:10.881
<i>but now it's our turn.</i>

16:10.998 --> 16:13.063
<i>Fire at will!</i>

16:24.683 --> 16:27.319
We are not entertained!

16:31.329 --> 16:32.702
I am Groot.

16:32.852 --> 16:34.298
!
I know those missiles

16:34.335 --> 16:37.009
are headed straight for Quill
and Victoria. [grunts]

16:37.876 --> 16:38.929
I am Groot.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.812
I guess going over
the general's head

16:40.837 --> 16:43.369
and talking straight
to the council could work.

16:44.134 --> 16:47.751
Yo, Supreme Lack-of-Intelligence,
you seeing this?

16:47.821 --> 16:49.821
As a citizen
of this lousy galaxy,

16:49.899 --> 16:54.046
I demand your stupid council take back
its stupid vote right-stupid-now!

16:54.329 --> 16:55.860
I am Groot!

16:56.212 --> 16:59.350
<i>Fortunately,
neither rodent nor shrubbery</i>

16:59.868 --> 17:01.602
<i>wield that authority.</i>

17:01.837 --> 17:06.267
<i>The vote was unanimous,
with only a single abstention.</i>

17:06.406 --> 17:09.727
Abstention? Which one of you
krutackers didn't vote?

17:09.797 --> 17:12.734
I am Groot.
[thunderclap]

17:16.895 --> 17:20.270
The Prince of Asgard
votes with deeds, not words.

17:20.968 --> 17:22.605
[grunts]

17:29.762 --> 17:31.911
What in the galaxy...

17:33.181 --> 17:36.419
Eh, never mind.
I figured it out.

17:38.028 --> 17:40.325
Yo, Thor, a little help here?

17:40.505 --> 17:43.715
Fear not, small mammal.
[grunts]

17:47.567 --> 17:51.809
I have bound my fate to you
Guardians before and I do so again.

17:51.926 --> 17:55.231
Great, 'cause I got just the job
for a guy who can hurl lightning.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.801
You see that Symbiote-infested
comet over there?

17:58.013 --> 17:59.340
Verily.

17:59.559 --> 18:02.411
- That mean yes?
- I am Groot.

18:03.247 --> 18:05.017
[yells]

18:07.888 --> 18:10.856
[screeching]

18:18.045 --> 18:20.064
You think Rocket's plan worked?

18:20.584 --> 18:23.373
<i>[automated male voice] Warning.
Radiation leak detected.</i>

18:23.498 --> 18:26.428
[alarm blaring] Spoken too soon.
That mist is toxic,

18:26.505 --> 18:28.498
and I'm reading hull breaches
all over the ship.

18:28.638 --> 18:32.771
[Drax] Then it would be best to leave this
area for a more stable part of the ship.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.197
We're not gonna make it.
I can shield us.

18:36.244 --> 18:38.400
[alarm continues blaring]

18:44.537 --> 18:45.868
[alarm blaring]

18:45.893 --> 18:48.447
<i>[automated female voice]
Force field activated.</i>

18:48.713 --> 18:52.463
Okay. No problem. We can still
figure a way out of this, sis.

18:52.768 --> 18:54.119
Sis?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.205
Victoria!

18:57.869 --> 19:00.643
No!
[grunting]

19:01.502 --> 19:03.127
You can't go in there, Quill.

19:03.213 --> 19:05.236
See? She's trying
to seal the leak.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.284
But no one could survive
the toxic mist.

19:08.573 --> 19:10.159
She knows that!

19:10.393 --> 19:13.620
Victoria, don't do this!
There's gotta be another way!

19:14.182 --> 19:16.666
Victoria? No!

19:20.029 --> 19:21.685
[Victoria]
I know that.

19:22.068 --> 19:24.962
That's why I got
these survival suits.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.825
I thought... Okay. I thought
you did something stupid.

19:29.060 --> 19:31.419
Relax.
That's still your job.

19:31.646 --> 19:33.716
Warriors of Spartax,

19:33.786 --> 19:36.482
cease this fruitless attack
in the name of honor,

19:36.560 --> 19:39.044
Asgard,
and the Galactic Council!

19:39.161 --> 19:41.075
<i>[General Glogug]
Stand down, Thor.</i>

19:41.169 --> 19:43.146
<i>We're going to bomb
that comet to dust,</i>

19:43.171 --> 19:45.443
<i>even if it means bombing
you with it.</i>

19:45.544 --> 19:47.435
You do not represent
the council,

19:47.622 --> 19:50.677
this has nothing to do
with Asgard, and honor...

19:50.849 --> 19:54.216
Well, that's
just an old-fashioned word.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.146
- <i>[Victoria] Like "empress"?</i>
- [gasps]

19:59.380 --> 20:03.738
I, Victoria, Empress of
Spartax and all its people,

20:03.810 --> 20:06.216
order this fleet to stand down.

20:06.474 --> 20:10.310
Whoever fires the next missile
will be a traitor to the empire

20:10.419 --> 20:12.411
and dealt with as such.

20:12.707 --> 20:14.544
[stammering]

20:14.677 --> 20:17.958
Please forgive me for this
misunderstanding, Empress.

20:18.114 --> 20:21.450
<i>I was only following protocol.</i>

20:22.466 --> 20:24.770
Somebody's gonna be looking
for a new job.

20:24.872 --> 20:28.036
You think I should hire pirates
and mercenaries instead?

20:28.193 --> 20:30.458
Don't knock it till you try it.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.767
[beeping] No sign of
Symbiotes on the surface.

20:35.876 --> 20:38.908
- I am Groot!
- Or below it.

20:39.033 --> 20:42.931
Verily, Guardians.
Victory is yours this day.

20:43.861 --> 20:47.697
- So it does mean yes.
- I am Groot.

20:48.055 --> 20:49.665
Asgard awaits.

20:49.837 --> 20:51.697
Open the Bifrost, Heimdall!

20:51.806 --> 20:53.285
[thunderclap]

20:59.479 --> 21:01.118
I am Groot!

21:01.229 --> 21:04.893
I thought <i> you</i> were gonna
scan him for Symbiotes.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.315
[grunting]

21:08.479 --> 21:11.815
What sorcery is this?

21:18.946 --> 21:20.744
Did Thor just...

21:20.821 --> 21:23.470
Get taken over
by the killer alien goop?

21:23.571 --> 21:24.982
[groans]

21:25.688 --> 21:29.212
And now it's loose in Asgard!
