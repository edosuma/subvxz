00:31.988 --> 00:33.598
Hi, Steve.
Good to see you.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.165
Sorry I'm late.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.949
I've only been in Shanghai
for a few months.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.822
Kinda buried. Yeah,
I'm sure you're busy.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.563
And I didn't mean
to keep pestering you.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.434
It's just
the clock is ticking.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.786
This is gonna derail
the General's confirmation,

00:47.830 --> 00:50.311
- isn't it?
- Maybe, but considering

00:50.354 --> 00:52.791
he's the President's choice
for Defense Secretary,

00:52.835 --> 00:54.750
I think the American people
have a right to know.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.409
Did you bring the document,
Steve?

01:01.452 --> 01:03.889
The thumb drive,
do you have it?

01:03.933 --> 01:07.415
Shoot.
I totally spaced.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.981
I'm sorry.
It's back at the consulate.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.200
No problem.
I'll walk you back.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.680
Oh, no, no, no.
That's okay. Really.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.116
I can just go grab it
and--

01:13.160 --> 01:14.335
Blow me off?

01:15.814 --> 01:18.991
Look, Steve, I get it.
I know this is scary.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.733
It's much easier to do nothing,
however the story's written.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.692
So we can drag
this on for days

01:23.735 --> 01:25.128
while you work up the nerve
to do what you know is right,

01:25.172 --> 01:26.956
or you can hand me that
thumb drive

01:26.999 --> 01:28.958
that's in your pocket right now
and get on with your life.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.625
You did
the right thing, Steve.

01:43.668 --> 01:44.669
Thank you.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.760
Yeah, good.
Read it back again.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.416
No, keep that second graf
where it is.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.288
Drop that line in at the end.
Read it back.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.858
Yeah, that-- that's good.
And I'm good with the artwork.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.818
Hey, Eileen,
you got a minute?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.689
- No. On deadline.
- I know.
It's about your source.

02:04.733 --> 02:05.908
Still no.
Still on deadline.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.344
We need more on rank
or background

02:07.388 --> 02:08.606
to help verify
some information.

02:08.650 --> 02:09.868
No, you don't.
My source is good.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.174
Rushmi and legal
have signed off.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.393
Eileen,
we are exposed here.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.655
It's a single source.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.178
I think you're making
a mistake.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.049
I know you do, but you're wrong.
And you're panicking.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.616
I've been doing this since you
were finger painting

02:18.660 --> 02:20.140
with baby food,
and right now

02:20.183 --> 02:21.837
I'm 23 minutes away
from publishing a story

02:21.880 --> 02:23.795
I've spent five months investigating.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.320
So please take your
all-hands-on-deck approach

02:26.363 --> 02:28.409
and get the hell away
from my desk.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.497
Thank you.

02:34.066 --> 02:37.766
Story's getting read.
15,000 uniques every 10 minutes.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.681
We have TV requests
from "Morning Joe,"

02:39.724 --> 02:42.510
"Today Show,"
"GMA," and Fox.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.728
Anything from the General?

02:43.772 --> 02:45.208
Not yet.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.688
Idiots are
already at the gate.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.820
Most of them
haven't even read the article.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.736
- I love social media.
- Don't engage.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.173
Too late.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.783
Eileen, go home.

02:54.826 --> 02:55.914
Get some rest.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.177
Let us monitor this.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.700
Good night, Rushmi.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.919
Oh, Eileen...

03:00.963 --> 03:02.704
this is very good work.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.883
To comrade Fitzgerald, who can
now count the US military

03:07.926 --> 03:10.233
on her exceedingly long list
of enemies.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.800
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.107
He's a bully.
I hate bullies.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.718
Besides, he's retired.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.110
Once a five-star
general...

03:18.154 --> 03:20.243
...always a five-star general.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.332
And soon-to-be
Secretary of Defense.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.726
Not anymore
according to my source.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.031
Really?

03:26.075 --> 03:27.424
There it is.
The eye of the tiger.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.817
You already got the scoop, Eileen.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.340
Time to share.
We're all friends.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.689
Are we? Really?

03:31.733 --> 03:32.908
- No.
- Yes, we are.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.345
To my friends,

03:35.389 --> 03:38.305
may you always stay
one story behind me.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.436
Anything for you.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.707
Why? I have 10 minutes.
"Morning Joe" isn't until 6:00.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.274
<i>We canceled it.
We have a problem.</i>

03:51.318 --> 03:52.536
<i>You need to come in.</i>

03:52.580 --> 03:54.277
What kind of problem?

03:54.321 --> 03:57.411
<i>The General's team is going
after your source.</i>

03:57.454 --> 03:59.021
Of course they are.
Who's his team?

03:59.064 --> 04:01.284
<i>Baxter.
Crisis Management.</i>

04:01.328 --> 04:03.068
He's scared.
What's his angle?

04:03.112 --> 04:06.115
<i>They're saying
the documents were forged.</i>

04:06.158 --> 04:08.117
That's not possible.
No way.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.858
Let me get out there
and defend my story.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.773
<i>We need to get to the bottom
of this first.</i>

04:11.816 --> 04:14.732
<i>Stay off your social media,
and I'll see you at the office.</i>

04:15.994 --> 04:17.300
Anything
from your source?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.215
He's gone dark
and disappeared.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.348
Consulate said he took
personal time.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.350
Look, the General's a bad guy.
We know it.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.917
But if the documents
are fake--It's on them to prove they are.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.310
Baxter is
threatening suit.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.572
Oh, he's bluffing.
Grow a pair.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.182
- That's unnecessary.
- Eileen.

04:30.226 --> 04:33.708
These are tweets you sent
last night, correct?

04:33.751 --> 04:35.405
Yeah, and I stand by them.
Why?

04:35.449 --> 04:37.842
They're being used to feed
a narrative about your behavior.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.931
- My behavior?
- Complaints have surfaced

04:39.975 --> 04:41.498
about how you
treat the staff.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.152
That you're abusive.
Especially towards women.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.806
- What?
- Including one yesterday.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.198
Shailey Granger
from research.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.505
Did she approach you
about your source?

04:48.549 --> 04:49.811
Five minutes
before publishing.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.639
I wanted to throw
my stapler at her.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.252
Oh, stop. She overstepped.
I'm not gonna pull punches.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.862
This is a newsroom,
not a daycare.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
That's how you learn.
That's how <i>I</i> learned.

04:59.429 --> 05:00.996
That narrative
is gaining traction.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.737
It started with a small piece
in <i>The Daily Beast</i>

05:02.780 --> 05:04.347
and now <i>The Times</i> and Fox News
have picked it up.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
They're trying
to cancel me now?

05:06.088 --> 05:08.482
First things first,
we need to walk back the story.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.310
We'll post an editor's note
saying that we take

05:10.353 --> 05:12.616
these allegations very seriously
and we're gonna re-report.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.096
Absolutely not.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.532
The General uses power
and connections

05:15.576 --> 05:17.186
to sell arms to bad people.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.406
Innocent people died
as a result. That's the truth.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.103
Eileen,
we don't have a choice.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.584
We do have a choice.
We can choose not to back down.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.326
We can choose to fight and stop
acting like a bunch of scared

05:26.369 --> 05:28.197
woke wussies more interested
in eating their own

05:28.240 --> 05:29.503
than reporting the news.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.637
We will
re-report the story.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.641
You do that, Rushmi,
I walk.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.208
And I swear
I won't come back.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.282
That's all I need.
Great. Thanks.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.775
Hey, Jefferson.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.212
<i>There's
a Stanley Cornik here.</i>

06:27.256 --> 06:28.649
In the lobby?

06:43.228 --> 06:44.404
Hi, Fitzgerald.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.492
Stanley.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.189
Your hair's shorter.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.974
You haven't seen me in 17 years.
Why are you here?

06:50.018 --> 06:53.369
You wouldn't return my calls,
so I thought I'd pop by.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.719
"Pop by"?
From Alaska?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.027
Want some water?

06:59.070 --> 07:01.464
I'm good, thanks.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.466
Nice place.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.685
What you working on?

07:04.728 --> 07:06.208
You can buy the book.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.688
Sure you
wanna do that?

07:07.731 --> 07:09.472
I have to. I was right.
I am right.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.257
The General's bad,
but so was your source.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.216
You flew 3,000 miles
to tell me that?

07:14.259 --> 07:15.739
Or was it to apologize
for screwing me over

07:15.783 --> 07:17.741
on my story
17 years ago?

07:17.785 --> 07:20.178
Both.
Mistakes were made.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.571
Why are you here,
Stanley?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.443
To offer you a job.[ Laughs ] Jesus.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.575
One-year contract.
General assignment. No strings.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.316
- I'm not that desperate.
- You're not?

07:27.359 --> 07:29.100
When's the last time
you left this apartment?

07:29.144 --> 07:30.362
I'm writing my book.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.625
And what happens
when it's done?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.191
I don't know,
but I'm not going to Alaska.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.715
Not a chance.
It's the minor leagues.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.020
I paid my dues.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.457
I'm finishing the book,
and I'm out.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.763
Come on, Fitzgerald.
You're a born reporter.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.591
You're one of the best.

07:41.635 --> 07:42.897
Oh, really?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.376
Maybe you don't read the news, Stanley.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.900
But it turns out
I'm a two-bit hack,

07:45.943 --> 07:47.510
blinded by
my own ambition.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.730
Oh, and I'm a woman-hating bully
to boot.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.253
Ironic, isn't it?

07:51.296 --> 07:53.429
I spent my whole career
battling a bunch

07:53.473 --> 07:55.083
of good ol' boy
misogynists

07:55.126 --> 07:57.433
only to get canceled
for being one myself.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.001
So yeah, I'm done.
I'm done! I'm done!

08:05.572 --> 08:08.226
Now, if you could leave

08:08.270 --> 08:10.533
so that
I can get back to work.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.230
Yeah, sure.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.803
But for what it's worth,

08:19.847 --> 08:23.546
we need good reporting
in the minor leagues, too.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.122
You don't know of a good
Italian joint

08:34.165 --> 08:35.689
in the neighborhood,
do you?

08:38.692 --> 08:40.084
We just had
our second kid

08:40.128 --> 08:41.782
when <i>The Daily Alaskan</i>
reached out.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.132
Going home felt right.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.047
What about you?
Never married?

08:46.090 --> 08:49.006
Tried it for a year.
He was a photojournalist.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.487
We both loved our jobs
more than each other.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.749
He was a good guy.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.142
Still friends?

08:54.185 --> 08:56.710
We were until he died
in Afghanistan.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.189
I'm sorry.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.845
Sure you're not hungry?

09:01.889 --> 09:03.151
I'm fine.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.805
Are you?

09:08.896 --> 09:10.506
So, you're
the big boss now.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.031
Is it
- all you hoped for?
- Yeah, it is.

09:14.075 --> 09:18.209
One catch-- My staff is down
from about 100 to 25,

09:18.253 --> 09:21.169
covering a state two and
a half times the size of Texas.

09:21.212 --> 09:25.913
We're doing good work,
but we're just missing too much.

09:25.956 --> 09:29.046
I'm one reporter, Stanley.
I can't fix your problems.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.527
You break big stories, Eileen.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.009
You do that for us,
we stay relevant, we stay alive.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.796
Her name is Gloria Nanmac.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.930
She lived in Meade,
in the Northwest Arctic Borough.

09:42.973 --> 09:46.020
She went missing after a party
two years ago.

09:46.063 --> 09:49.023
Two hunters found her body
three months later.

09:49.066 --> 09:52.287
Police ruled out foul play.
Her mother disagrees.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.942
It's a story about
a dead woman in Alaska.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.553
Put your cops reporter on it.
You don't need me.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.208
It's not just a story
about a dead woman in Alaska.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
She's indigenous.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.041
So are they.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.610
It's a story about how

10:10.653 --> 10:13.003
the Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women crisis

10:13.047 --> 10:15.440
is being largely ignored.

10:15.484 --> 10:19.270
It's a big story, and it starts
with Gloria Nanmac.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.251
You still awake?

10:43.294 --> 10:44.861
<i>Yep, I'm on Alaska time.</i>

10:44.905 --> 10:47.081
I was on your website.
You guys only did one story

10:47.124 --> 10:48.604
and a short follow
on Gloria's death?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.692
<i>We had to move on.</i>

10:49.736 --> 10:51.607
The police
weren't cooperating.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.435
We still haven't gotten
the police report.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.958
<i>Two years later? Why?</i>

10:55.002 --> 10:56.656
They determined there was
no foul play,

10:56.699 --> 10:58.179
which means the case
should be closed.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.659
<i>Why are they holding
on to that report?</i>

10:59.702 --> 11:01.051
Good question.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.357
So, how'd you get
the death certificate?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.489
Her family? <i>
Yeah, her mother.</i>

11:04.533 --> 11:07.710
Is it just me,
or does it sound like

11:07.754 --> 11:09.190
you're digging
into the story?

11:09.233 --> 11:11.105
I can't go to
Alaska, Stanley.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.889
It's ridiculous.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.718
Eileen, this story can change
the national conversation.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.154
<i>So could my book
on the General.</i>

11:17.198 --> 11:18.808
That matters to me.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.723
Green, He's the Secretary
of Defense, and he shouldn't be.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.985
<i>I agree.</i>

11:22.029 --> 11:24.814
You can work on the book
in Anchorage.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.904
I just...

11:27.948 --> 11:29.253
don't know
if I'm ready.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.342
<i>I got a strong hunch
you are.</i>

11:31.386 --> 11:35.216
You might be hurt and you
might be pissed off, Eileen,

11:35.259 --> 11:36.565
but you're not done.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.262
<i>And I think you know it.</i>

11:40.874 --> 11:41.831
Good night.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.659
<i>Good night.</i>

12:05.942 --> 12:07.639
I'm sorry.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.296
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

12:12.340 --> 12:14.864
<i>The fasten seatbelt light
is on.</i>

12:16.387 --> 12:18.563
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

12:24.482 --> 12:25.745
Let me go, lady.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.096
Ma'am, return
to your seat.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.662
Ma'am. Ma'am!

12:30.706 --> 12:32.752
- What's wrong with the air?
- Return to your seat.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.754
Ma'am!

12:49.725 --> 12:50.900
You okay?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.032
What happened?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.337
You fainted.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.383
You've been asleep
for two hours.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.863
Your vitals are good,

12:56.906 --> 12:58.212
but you should probably
drink lots of water.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.388
Are you a doctor?
No.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.695
I'm a village health aid.
Kind of like an EMT.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.570
I'm Melinda.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.007
Eileen.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
Has that happened
before?

13:12.661 --> 13:13.923
No. Never.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.707
I felt like I was having
a heart attack.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.361
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't that.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.233
So, what was it?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.757
Maybe a panic attack.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.324
Have you been under
a lot of stress?

13:23.367 --> 13:24.978
No.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.455
Hi, Ms. Fitzgerald?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.674
I'm Gabriel Tovar.
Welcome to Alaska.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.415
- Thanks.
- Is this all you have?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.677
That's it. Wow.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.592
I pack more when
I go to Juneau.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.421
Okay.
So we should go, yeah?

14:17.465 --> 14:20.163
Yes, Definitely.
I'm sorry. Let's go.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.261
How was your flight?
Any problems?

14:31.305 --> 14:33.524
No. No problems.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.571
I just have to say,
I'm a huge fan of yours.

14:36.614 --> 14:40.792
It's truly inspirational to--
to meet you and drive you.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.230
And I'm really sorry
about what happened,

14:43.273 --> 14:46.102
you know,
with your story...

14:46.146 --> 14:48.235
on the General.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.987
I love this hotel.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.511
Always wanted
to stay here.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.947
Dare to dream.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.688
Is the city
always this empty?

15:06.731 --> 15:08.211
You must be used
to New York crowds.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.170
I'm used to people, yeah.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.736
They have
a great rooftop restaurant,

15:11.780 --> 15:14.609
a very lovely spa,
a gift shop, an art gallery.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.958
Am I talking too much?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.526
- Right on the edge.
- I completely understand.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.267
I think I'm good, Gabriel.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.531
Oh, okay, um,
I have a little gift.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.446
Here's a sleep mask.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.100
Thanks, but I don't use
a sleep mask.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.493
First timers from the lower 48
have trouble sleeping.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.365
The sun won't set
until about 11:30.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.062
You should take it.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.979
- See you in the morning.
- Can't wait.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.288
<i>Hello?</i>
Hi. Can I speak
to Sylvie Nanmac, please?

15:41.331 --> 15:44.378
<i>She's not here.</i> Uh, do you expect
her back soon?

15:44.421 --> 15:47.468
<i>She's down in Anchorage
to see her doctor.</i>

15:47.511 --> 15:49.600
Hope everything's okay.
Is this her husband?

15:49.644 --> 15:52.038
<i>No. I'm just
watching her cat.</i>

15:52.081 --> 15:54.562
Oh. Well, do you happen
to have her cell number?

15:54.605 --> 15:57.826
I've tried the number I have
a few times, but no luck.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.132
<i>Who is this?</i>

15:59.175 --> 16:00.698
My name is
Eileen Fitzgerald.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.701
I work for <i>The Van--
The Daily Alaskan,</i>

16:03.745 --> 16:07.096
and I'm doing a story about
her daughter Gloria's death.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.925
Hello?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.014
<i>Kinda late for you
to be calling.</i>

16:12.058 --> 16:13.842
<i>It's 10:30.</i>

16:13.885 --> 16:15.975
Oh, sorry. It is?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.542
Didn't realize.
It's so bright out.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.327
<i>Goodbye.</i>
Wait.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.850
Hello?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.348
Hello?

16:41.391 --> 16:43.089
<i>Good morning.</i> Hey, Gabriel.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.655
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

16:44.699 --> 16:46.353
On my way.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.140
Your coffee. <i>
Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:19.342 --> 17:21.083
Here we are.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.737
What's this?

17:22.780 --> 17:23.955
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:23.999 --> 17:25.653
This is a strip mall.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.090
What happened to the big
glass lobby with white pillars?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.570
Oh, that was
the old building.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.138
We moved three years ago. Downsizing.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.578
Hi, Janice.
This is Eileen Fitzgerald.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.450
She's starting today.
I have a key card for her.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.149
She's very shy.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.548
This is where
it all happens.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.637
I can see that.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.553
So, coffee and tea
are here,

17:56.597 --> 17:58.599
but there's
a drive-through coffee

17:58.642 --> 18:00.209
just out front
that's way better.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.602
I used to work there.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.908
That's how I started here, actually.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.086
And, well,
this is your desk.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.610
I left you some new pads
and pens.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.438
Why is it
so quiet in here?

18:11.481 --> 18:12.569
Is it?
Yeah.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.005
Extremely.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.137
Like, dead.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.834
Oh, okay.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.012
Um, that's the editors
meeting in there.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.840
Looks like they started.

18:22.884 --> 18:26.279
The City Assembly is considering
requiring bars to close earlier

18:26.322 --> 18:28.455
due to a--Eileen: Hey, sorry.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.283
Sorry I'm late. Hi.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.502
Gang,
Eileen Fitzgerald.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.070
Eileen, our editorial
legion of doom.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.639
Let's do intros
as we go, Bob.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.468
Thank you, Stanley.
Bob Young, Senior reporter.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.600
Acting News Editor
covering Mary Debnick

18:43.644 --> 18:46.125
who is on
maternity leave.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.692
Where was I before
the interruption?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.694
Oh, yes, the bars
closing earlier

18:50.738 --> 18:52.653
due to an excess
of street violence

18:52.696 --> 18:55.438
and the armed police standoff
in Muldoon.

18:55.482 --> 18:59.529
Suspect was male, 20s,
Caucasian, and completely nude.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.531
Claimed he was
unfairly evicted.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.881
He's been remanded
to police custody.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.187
Yuna Park is covering.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.710
- Was he renting?
- We don't know.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.670
Anchorage PD refused
to provide a unit number.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.672
- So no police report?
- No.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.021
It's an open investigation.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.370
Did they enter
the apartment?

19:14.414 --> 19:16.677
Yes. I assume they did.
Why?

19:16.720 --> 19:19.201
If they entered the apartment
of a private citizen,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.029
don't they need to provide
the unit number?

19:21.072 --> 19:23.292
So far, all they've provided
is the block number.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.598
Did you check
the CAD notes?

19:24.641 --> 19:26.208
They refuse
to provide them.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.341
CAD notes are public record.
They don't have a choice.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.430
We have a strained relationship
with Anchorage PD.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.649
They aren't prioritizing
our requests.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.347
So sic legal on them.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.827
Our lawyer hasn't been
as effective as we'd
like him to be.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.612
Well, is he a wimp
or just no good?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.353
Charlie's a very good lawyer and
very well-liked in this town.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.268
Well, good for Charlie,
but you don't need well-liked,

19:42.311 --> 19:43.878
you need a jerk
who gets records.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.837
We don't believe we need
to be jerks to do our jobs.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.013
Maybe not, but I'm guessing
it was good ol' Charlie

19:49.057 --> 19:50.232
who couldn't get
the police report

19:50.276 --> 19:51.581
in Gloria Nanmac's
death either.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.366
Who?
Eileen.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.716
Reporters need support in order
to do their job, Stanley.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.021
We'll talk about
this offline.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.762
This is w--
Offline.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.461
Bob,
that about wrap it up?

20:07.336 --> 20:09.469
Hey, Pete.
Eileen Fitzgerald.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.559
Yeah, it has been a minute.
Uh, good.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.604
Uh, listen, I could use your
help getting ahold of some--

20:14.648 --> 20:16.215
Whoa.

20:18.129 --> 20:21.350
Sorry, I saw a bug.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.005
Yeah, um, yeah,
I could use your help

20:24.048 --> 20:28.575
getting ahold of some
police records in Anchorage.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.229
Alaska.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.406
Yeah, it's a long story.
Can you help me out?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.929
Thanks. I'll send
over the details.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.887
But if anyone asks
for a name,

20:36.931 --> 20:39.760
give them Bob Young,
Acting News Editor.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.805
I gotta jump.
Thanks, Pete.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.634
Eileen?
Claire Muncy.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.462
- I'm a reporter here.
- Oh, yeah.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.291
I just read your story on the
white nationalist deli owner.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.858
It was a great piece.
Heck of a guy.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.773
Thanks, yeah,
real winner.

20:52.816 --> 20:53.904
I gotta get
to the courthouse.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.297
I just wanted
to say welcome.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.212
- You cover courts, too?
- We all cover everything.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.518
Small newsroom.

20:58.561 --> 20:59.954
Yeah, there was a-a kid
under my desk.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.347
Zachary.
Belongs to Austin.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.133
Oh, he doesn't bite.
Just don't touch his iPad.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.004
- Austin Teague.
- Hi, thanks.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.441
Oh, uh, Claire.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.573
I'm trying to track down
this woman from Meade.

21:10.617 --> 21:11.966
She's here to see
her doctor.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.055
Any idea where
I could start?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.709
- Alaska Native?
- She is, yeah.

21:15.752 --> 21:18.320
The Alaska Native
Health & Hospital Center.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.670
Most villages don't have
hospitals or even clinics.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.672
If you're Alaska Native,
you go there.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.848
It's pretty impressive.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.024
Oh! I'm sorry.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.765
Whoa, sorry.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.332
Didn't see you standing there
right directly behind me.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.899
I wanted to
introduce myself.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.422
Okay, now or later?
'Cause I gotta get going.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.250
Now. Yuna Park.
I'm a reporter.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.470
Oh, yeah.
You're on that police standoff

21:37.513 --> 21:39.559
with the naked guy in, uh...
Muldoon. Yes.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.039
Uh, between us, I'm gonna
get you those CAD notes.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.650
The CAD notes?

21:43.693 --> 21:46.000
- Yeah, the dispatcher notes.
- Oh, I know what they are,

21:46.043 --> 21:47.393
but the police
aren't providing them.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.003
Yeah, I heard.
I'll get them.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.961
They'll tell us what apartment
Mr. Naked lived in.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.573
My driver awaits.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.760
This place is huge.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.457
You want me to
come in with you?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.851
- I'll manage. Thanks.
- I'll be right here.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.854
Woman over PA: <i>Attention, all
available nursing personnel,</i>

22:13.897 --> 22:16.465
<i>please report
to the attending board.</i>

22:16.509 --> 22:19.076
<i>All available
nursing personnel...</i>

22:19.120 --> 22:21.731
I'm here to see
Sylvie Nanmac.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.038
Um, may I ask your name?

22:24.081 --> 22:25.909
Eileen Fitzgerald.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.047
Man on TV: <i>
Temperature dropping from
59 degrees in the afternoon.</i>

22:34.918 --> 22:36.529
Mrs. Nanmac?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.403
You're that reporter
who left messages on my cell.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.492
That's right. I want to talk
to you about Gloria.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.842
If I wanted to talk to you,
I would have called you back.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.367
Mrs. Nanmac,
I just want to help.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.934
You're too late for that.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.894
Your paper wrote two
small articles on Gloria.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.330
Two.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.202
They said she used drugs,
that she got arrested.

22:58.246 --> 23:01.031
They made <i>her</i> out to be
the criminal, not the victim.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.816
I understand how you feel.
I'm--

23:02.859 --> 23:05.558
You have no idea
how I feel!

23:05.601 --> 23:07.342
What I went through!

23:07.386 --> 23:09.562
How could you?

23:09.605 --> 23:10.824
Please don't come back.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.521
Mrs. Nanmac.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.697
Ma'am? Could you come
with me please?

23:20.747 --> 23:23.227
Congratulations.
Here for less that 24 hours

23:23.271 --> 23:25.621
and thrown out of one
of our leading hospitals.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.014
Yay me.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.059
I gotta go back.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.453
- She won't talk to you.
- Why?

23:32.802 --> 23:34.587
She's angry
about our coverage.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.241
Well, I can't say I blame her,
but that's you, not me.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.330
She'll be even more
reluctant to talk

23:39.374 --> 23:41.550
when she finds out
you don't know the place.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.684
Unless I send you with one
of our other reporters.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.294
No way.
It'll be helpful.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.774
I don't care.
I work alone.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.037
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in, Roz.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.082
Meet Eileen Fitzgerald.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.606
Hi.
Hi.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.477
Rosalind Friendly.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.392
Roz, I want to put you
on a story with Eileen.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.698
Stanley.

23:58.741 --> 23:59.916
I'm right in the middle
of my story

23:59.960 --> 24:00.917
on the Governor's
task force.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.179
You can do both for now.

24:02.223 --> 24:03.485
Could have given me
a heads up.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.400
- Me, too, for that matter.
- Fair enough.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.141
Apologies to you both.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.490
I still want it to happen.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.710
Unless one of you wants
to step aside.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.235
What's the story?

24:14.278 --> 24:15.584
Cold case in Meade.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.978
A dead woman named
Gloria Nanmac.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.284
Another
Missing and Murdered.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.721
Why?
"Why"?

24:21.764 --> 24:23.810
Yeah, even if we figure out
what happened,

24:23.853 --> 24:25.551
no one's gonna
do anything about it.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.118
Not the cops, not the courts,
not the politicians--

24:28.162 --> 24:30.643
Then we report on that.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.993
You mean that?
You'll take it all the way?

24:33.036 --> 24:34.429
I do.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.344
Her death is obviously
part of a pattern.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.955
We need to prove it, and we need
to show who's to blame.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.523
Great. So, why not just give
the whole story to me?

24:41.567 --> 24:42.829
For starters,
it's my story.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.526
Do you know anything
about Alaska?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.702
That's why it's called
investigative reporting.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.835
Is that why you're here?
To teach us about reporting?

24:48.878 --> 24:50.532
- Is she always like this?
- Yes.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.448
Roz, you wanted the statehouse.
You got statehouse.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.364
That's before I knew that doing
this story right was an option.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.800
Fine, but Eileen
is here now,

24:57.844 --> 25:00.542
and I want you both on it
together, okay?

25:02.457 --> 25:04.372
Okay.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.156
I got an interview
across town in 20 minutes.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.767
Can I go?
Mm-hmm.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.207
I'm not here
to mentor, Stanley.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.904
- How about player coach?
- No.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.993
Especially with
a Gen whatever she is.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.691
They play tough until
their feelings get hurt

25:18.734 --> 25:21.128
and then they--Get you canceled.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.000
Yeah. That.
And it sucks.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.046
I know you're used
to working alone,

25:26.089 --> 25:27.700
but we do things
differently here.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.832
We have to.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.574
Maybe it wouldn't hurt
to try something new.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.054
Like move to Alaska?

25:35.272 --> 25:37.797
- There you go.
- One of those for me?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.364
It could be if you tell me
what you think of the new kid.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.192
- I'll get my own.
- Come on, Claire.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.542
I know you got
an opinion on her.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.544
I'm not paid
for my opinions.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.720
Which raises the question,
how much is Stanley paying her,

25:47.763 --> 25:50.026
and where did
he find the money?

25:50.070 --> 25:51.811
No more questions
at this time.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.290
Final question, Senator.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.205
You think she'll make it
through the winter?

25:55.249 --> 25:57.033
Doesn't seem like
a quitter.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.487
That was the night
she disappeared.

26:18.925 --> 26:21.797
Who are you, Toby Crenshaw?

26:30.371 --> 26:32.634
Hey, uh...

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
- Austin.
- Austin. Right.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.985
Do you have
the Nexus login?

26:36.029 --> 26:37.117
I need to run a search
on a few names.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.814
We don't have Nexus.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.338
We got busted for sharing
the same account.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.297
- Welcome to the big time.
- Impressive.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.647
Uh, well,
we have a printer?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.649
That we do.
It may even work.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.433
Um, ask Gabriel.
He'll hook you up.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.521
Thanks.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.917
Attaboy, Pete.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.963
Yuna, the CAD notes
are available.

26:57.006 --> 26:57.964
How'd that happen?

26:58.007 --> 26:59.487
I know a guy.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.315
Thank you.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.797
Gabriel.
Yeah?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.842
I hear you're the guy
that can make things happen.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.757
Absolutely.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.454
Do you need
something to happen?

27:10.498 --> 27:13.327
I do.
A few things, actually.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.025
You're press? <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

27:16.069 --> 27:18.158
These CAD notes aren't
available to the press.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.942
I think they are.
Can you double check?

27:23.859 --> 27:25.513
This is the thing
with that New York lawyer.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.646
That's right.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.343
Hang on.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.525
Bob Young.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.875
Oh. Hi, Captain.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.703
To what do I owe the honor?

27:46.795 --> 27:48.884
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.850
Jordan Teller.
How do I know...

28:02.028 --> 28:04.160
That Jordan Teller.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.553
Yuna?

28:05.596 --> 28:06.815
Did you get the CAD notes
on the Muldoon case?

28:06.859 --> 28:08.730
I did.
How exactly?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.036
I went to
the police station.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.559
Why did they
give them to you?

28:11.602 --> 28:13.735
Oh, I think Eileen had
a lawyer friend call.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.955
But, Bob, you're not
gonna believe this.
I knew it.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.739
Did you have a New York
lawyer pressure

28:17.783 --> 28:19.741
Anchorage PD into turning
over the CAD notes?

28:19.785 --> 28:21.003
I did, but I think
you know that.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.570
That is not
how we do things here.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.050
Maybe it should be.
It worked.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.226
You are jeopardizing
important relationships

28:26.269 --> 28:28.576
that we depend on
for valuable information.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.317
Playing nice for tips
doesn't work, Bob.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.580
You do that,
the cops own you.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.888
Stay away
from my reporters.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.759
Did you rat me out?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.935
- No, I would never.
- I'm kidding.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.458
Did the notes have
the apartment number?

28:41.502 --> 28:43.286
They did.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.724
And I just looked it up on the
city's property tax database.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.378
The apartment is owned by
an LLC called The Clubhouse,

28:48.422 --> 28:49.989
and it's controlled
by Jordan Teller.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.034
Whoa! Teller?

28:52.078 --> 28:53.732
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.908
He's the Executive Chair
of the Alaska Investment Fund.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.300
Oil money?

28:57.344 --> 28:59.085
Alaska's $64 billion
piggy bank.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.782
Pays out one check a year
to every Alaskan.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.871
It's one of the biggest
government jobs in the state.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.960
What's he doing with
a small apartment in Muldoon?

29:05.004 --> 29:08.268
Not to mention the gun-toting
naked guy that goes with it.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.096
You should go to the jail,
talk to Mr. Naked.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.924
I already tried.
I filed it with the PIO.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.273
They said
it was two weeks.

29:13.316 --> 29:14.622
Go again.
Tell them you're friends.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.667
But that's not true. Yet.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.321
You could end up
being great friends.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.062
- You never know.
- You know, I have a source

29:20.106 --> 29:22.021
on the board of
the Alaska Investment Fund.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.283
I can connect with him,
see what's up.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.241
- Thanks.
- You guys are good together.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.026
- What do you mean?
- Who?

29:27.069 --> 29:29.289
You make a great team.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.464
- I'll go make that call.
- Yeah.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.857
Cool, thanks.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.787
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.266
I don't know you.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.834
My name is Yuna Park.
I'm with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

29:52.878 --> 29:56.185
I want to talk to you about
what happened in Muldoon.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.404
I can't.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.101
Why?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.537
Because I want
to get out of here.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.278
Did someone tell you
not to talk?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.499
Was it Jordan Teller?

30:07.718 --> 30:11.374
Mr. Lewis, I just want to hear
your side of the story.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.682
This doesn't feel right
that you're in here.

30:14.725 --> 30:15.814
It's not.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.208
I-I've never been
in prison before.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.514
It sucks.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.994
Seems like it.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.739
W-We were dating.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.480
H-He bought that
apartment for me.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.395
For us.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.875
Who did? Mr. Teller?

30:33.919 --> 30:35.703
Jordan, yeah.

30:35.746 --> 30:38.793
Then he had some financial
troubles or something,

30:38.837 --> 30:41.317
and he just sold it
without telling me.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.537
Then what happened?

30:43.580 --> 30:46.148
Then the police showed up
and tried to throw me out.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.150
It was so humiliating.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.241
They were
having an affair?

30:52.285 --> 30:53.547
That's what
Mr. Lewis said.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.027
He said Teller bought him
the apartment

30:55.070 --> 30:56.550
but then started having
financial troubles,

30:56.593 --> 30:58.073
so he sold it.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.683
Mr. Lewis didn't
want to leave.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.729
So he stripped naked
and started waving a gun around?

31:01.772 --> 31:03.252
Something like that, yes.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.775
And my source
at the AIF said

31:04.819 --> 31:06.908
that Teller's being
audited internally.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.737
Misappropriation
of funds.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.392
Did he use money from the fund
to buy his love pad?

31:12.435 --> 31:17.049
I like the love pad throwback,
and, yeah, seems possible.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.789
My God. Okay.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.182
Reach out to Teller
for comment.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.663
- I'll let Stanley know.
- Got it. Thanks.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.013
Hey,
have you seen Eileen?

31:25.057 --> 31:26.667
Uh, yeah.
She's in your war room.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.364
I just dropped off
another map.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.626
Our war room?

31:29.670 --> 31:32.064
Yeah, that's what
she called it.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.113
How'd you manage this?

31:38.157 --> 31:40.637
The night editor
wasn't using it.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.422
Apparently he doesn't
like windows.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.728
You figured
that out in a day?

31:44.772 --> 31:47.209
It pays to be squeaky.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.733
These are Gloria's friends
from Meade.

31:49.777 --> 31:52.562
I'm particularly interested
in this guy, Toby Crenshaw.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.825
He invited her to the party
the night she went missing.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.349
His posts suggest
they were close

31:56.392 --> 31:57.654
and she was in
a bad place.

31:57.698 --> 31:58.960
And I scrubbed her,
and it tracks.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.744
How so?

32:00.788 --> 32:03.791
Well,
she was struggling--

32:03.834 --> 32:05.532
drugs and alcohol,
two misdemeanors.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.882
Yeah, we reported on that.
What's your point?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.406
Well, maybe she goes
to the party, things go badly,

32:10.450 --> 32:12.104
she wants to be alone,
and she ducks out.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.801
Wasn't her body found
on the tundra?

32:13.844 --> 32:15.846
Yeah. Here.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.370
And the party
was in town here.

32:17.413 --> 32:18.937
The tundra's frozen
in the winter.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.809
You can only get out there
by foot or snow machine.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.464
Doesn't make sense
that she walked all that way

32:24.507 --> 32:26.422
in the cold at night.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.728
She was upset.

32:27.771 --> 32:31.079
Maybe she wasn't planning on
walking back.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.560
You think she
committed suicide?

32:33.603 --> 32:35.518
It's been two years,
and no one's come forward

32:35.562 --> 32:37.694
with any information
that points to foul play.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.958
I read today that
the suicide rate in villages

32:40.001 --> 32:41.655
is five times
the national average.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.049
I know.
I grew up in one.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.660
I also know that suicide
is used as an excuse

32:46.703 --> 32:49.706
not to investigate
crimes against Native women.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.187
I'm not using it as an excuse.
I'm following the facts.

32:52.231 --> 32:55.016
Okay, then you can't
ignore the fact that if
she was white and blonde,

32:55.060 --> 32:56.235
we'd be assuming
she was murdered

32:56.278 --> 32:58.541
and her face
would be all over CNN.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.021
And you can't ignore the fact
that the truth here

33:00.065 --> 33:02.023
might not fit
your preferred narrative.

33:04.678 --> 33:05.940
Okay.

33:07.246 --> 33:08.638
That's it? Okay?

33:10.814 --> 33:14.035
Hey, I know you might resent
that Stanley put me on this.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.081
I resent he didn't come
to me first.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.039
But the fact remains
I'm here,

33:18.083 --> 33:19.910
and I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to break this story.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.303

35:42.314 --> 35:44.316
There's tons of
pilots in Alaska

35:44.359 --> 35:45.926
due to the severe
lack of roads,

35:45.969 --> 35:49.625

it's very limited.

- She couldn't walk

She was last seen alive

42:31.810 --> 42:33.376
Someone dropped her off
out there.

42:33.420 --> 42:35.161
Which means the cops were hasty
in ruling out foul play.

42:35.204 --> 42:37.511

you mean negligent, I agree.

42:39.295 --> 42:41.123
We need to talk to this guy,
Toby Crenshaw.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.386
But first, we need to see
a coroner's report.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.997
The medical examiner is here
in Anchorage.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.999
They won't release
the report to us.

42:47.042 --> 42:49.175
They will to family.

42:49.218 --> 42:51.046
You think Sylvie
will do it?

42:51.090 --> 42:52.613
I think she will.

42:52.657 --> 42:55.529
Hey, guys. Yuna's back.
She got a comment.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.009
He said he planned
on paying it back

42:57.052 --> 42:58.184
as soon as the sale
went through.

42:58.227 --> 42:59.620
Like a bridge loan.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.535
So he used illegal funds
to buy a love nest?

43:01.579 --> 43:03.102
That is correct.

43:03.145 --> 43:05.104
Well, what about the boyfriend?
Did he report that?

43:05.147 --> 43:06.584
I don't feel like--You have to.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.716
You already reported
Mr. Naked with a gun.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.153
- I'm not sure.
- It is the reason
he bought the apartment.

43:11.197 --> 43:12.938
Says Mr. Lewis.

43:12.981 --> 43:14.635
Do you have any other sources
confirming the relationship

43:14.679 --> 43:16.550
or if Teller bought
the apartment for him?

43:16.594 --> 43:17.943
No. Mr. Lewis
mentioned a friend,

43:17.986 --> 43:19.335
but I've not been able
to track him down.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.989
Sounds like
"he said, he said."

43:21.033 --> 43:22.948
I bet if you publish,
the friend will come forward.

43:22.991 --> 43:24.384
Agreed.
This one's got legs.

43:24.427 --> 43:26.125
Question is,
what do we publish?

43:26.168 --> 43:28.562
A flagrant misappropriation
of state funds.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.217
You can mention the relationship
in terms of the rent dispute,

43:31.260 --> 43:34.220
but I'd lay off the romance
until we have more.

43:34.263 --> 43:35.743
Well, you better hope
the Anchorage Eagle

43:35.787 --> 43:37.310
doesn't scoop that.
It's right up their alley.

43:37.353 --> 43:38.572
Definitely
up their alley.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.660
Bob, you good?

43:39.704 --> 43:42.402
I'm good.
Disturbed, but good.

43:42.445 --> 43:43.751
Write it up, Yuna.

43:43.795 --> 43:45.797
If it's good,
it's on the front page.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.059
Look at that.
First one.

43:47.102 --> 43:48.669
And it's a kill shot.
Nice job.

43:50.715 --> 43:54.457
I can't. I-I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

43:54.501 --> 43:55.545
Give the story to Eileen.

43:55.589 --> 43:57.199
What?
Why give it to me?

44:02.030 --> 44:04.119
Really?

44:04.163 --> 44:05.817
Fine.

44:09.124 --> 44:11.344
Hey, Yuna. Stop.

44:13.128 --> 44:14.390
Why are you giving me
the story?

44:14.434 --> 44:16.218
- It's your story.
- I don't want it.

44:16.262 --> 44:17.480
I can't do it.

44:17.524 --> 44:19.178
Do what? Write?

44:19.221 --> 44:21.441
I can't ruin this man's life
because he made a mistake.

44:21.484 --> 44:24.183
He's married.
I met his son.

44:24.226 --> 44:26.751
It's just a byline for me,
but it's his whole life.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.491
Did he say that to you?

44:30.493 --> 44:32.365
Right.

44:32.408 --> 44:35.498
Look,
this job isn't easy.

44:35.542 --> 44:36.891
And we don't do it
to be liked.

44:36.935 --> 44:38.719
We do it
'cause it matters.

44:38.763 --> 44:40.852
This is
an important story.

44:40.895 --> 44:42.810
Teller did something illegal,
and he did it with money

44:42.854 --> 44:45.117
that belongs to every
single person in this state.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.640
You think <i>The New York Times</i>
is gonna cover this?

44:46.684 --> 44:48.468
<i>The Post?</i>
No.

44:48.511 --> 44:50.688
This is exactly why
local journalism matters.

44:50.731 --> 44:52.646
Why this very small,
underfunded paper

44:52.690 --> 44:56.258
in this crappy
strip mall matters.

44:56.302 --> 44:57.738
Alaskans deserve to know.

44:57.782 --> 45:00.262
They'll decide.
Not you.

45:00.306 --> 45:01.786
Got it?

45:05.354 --> 45:06.791
Good.
Now go write your story.

45:09.794 --> 45:11.360
Thank you, Eileen.

45:11.404 --> 45:13.058
Yeah.

45:14.668 --> 45:16.583
You know what?

45:18.193 --> 45:19.891
I know Anchorage is

45:19.934 --> 45:21.806
the last place in the world
you ever expected to end up

45:21.849 --> 45:23.764
after the career
that you've had,

45:23.808 --> 45:27.333
but we're very lucky
to have you.

45:36.472 --> 45:38.866
