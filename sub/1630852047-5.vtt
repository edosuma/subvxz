WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.508
We forswear violence.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.093
<i>Have you ever been in battle?</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:11.303
Picked up a weapon? A sword?

00:11.387 --> 00:13.139
Bow and arrow? An ax?

00:16.684 --> 00:19.228
They say the White Tower
dispatched eight sisters

00:19.311 --> 00:21.063
<i>to deal with Logain's army.</i>

00:21.147 --> 00:23.941
I will not forget your faces
should we meet again.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.068
Mat's got
all the signs, lad.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.404
<i>The Dark One
corrupted the One Power</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:30.990
so men couldn't use it
without going mad.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.408
I see you.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.041
You are exactly what I thought
you were, Wisdom al'Meara.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.128
No bond is closer than
an Aes Sedai and her Warder.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.966
I've heard
about the bond.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.926
<i>That you feel what she feels.</i>

00:56.140 --> 00:58.267
- No!
-

02:57.052 --> 02:59.555
May the last embrace
of the mother welcome you home.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.262
A long time
since we've been home.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.347
Do you still
think of it as home?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.016
Don't you?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.809
This saddle is home.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.604
This cloak. These boots.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.814
This brooding man at my side.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.071
Is she ready
for what's waiting

06:02.154 --> 06:03.197
in the White City?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.865
You think she talks to me?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.493
She eats every night
at the Warders' fire.

06:09.912 --> 06:13.582
She's worried, about Stepin.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.709
Warders are not supposed
to outlive their Aes Sedai.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.672
Stepin's a strong man.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.217
He'll deliver her ring
to the Tower.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.351
You think the other four
are already there?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.645
If they are, we'll find them.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.440
And if they aren't...

06:38.524 --> 06:40.901
well, we'll find them.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.510
Watch it, you piece of sh...

07:20.107 --> 07:22.651
Mate, you all right?

07:22.734 --> 07:26.697
Will you stop looking at me
like you're my bloody wet nurse.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.991
Just tired.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.618
A month without a warm bed
will do that.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.707
That mountain.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.458
What?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.086
I don't know.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.046
I think I've seen it before.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.201
Tar Valon.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.110
Blood and ashes.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.786
Can I have one?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.454
Thank you.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.417
What is it?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.169
Mmm. Don't know.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.129
It tastes good, though.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.423
Not hungry. You have it.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.390
Should be down there.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.809
Thom told me about this place.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.353
The innkeeper was
an old friend of his.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.814
I'll give you one for this,
one for the other one.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.316
Thought we were going
to the White Tower.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.070
Yeah, we will.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.239
But first, we need to rest
and clean up.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.574
Think they'll let us in
looking like this?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.252
I can't believe a night here
is more expensive

09:45.335 --> 09:47.796
than a month
at the Winespring Inn.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.174
Better than the road.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.114
Tell me again.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.782
Mat...

10:15.866 --> 10:17.659
The little girl...

10:17.743 --> 10:21.121
- on the farm...
- It wasn't you, Mat.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.289
It wasn't you.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.124
Thom and I both saw it.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.209
Thom's not here.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.632
Thom's dead.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.385
Then please believe me.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.347
It was the Fade.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.184
You know you didn't kill
that family.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.270
You would never hurt
that little girl.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.834
This is the Warders' quarters.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.628
This is the safest place
in the Tower

11:09.711 --> 11:11.838
to stay away from the sisters
we traveled with.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.632
When the Amyrlin Seat arrives...

11:13.715 --> 11:15.425
I don't care
about the Amyrlin Seat

11:15.509 --> 11:16.843
or your Tower politics.

11:17.886 --> 11:21.139
I told you,
I care about my people.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.225
And you said they'd be here,
so where are they?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.060
I have eyes and ears
watching every gate

11:25.143 --> 11:27.229
and every wall in the city.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.815
If they've arrived, I'll know.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.234
But will you tell me?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.946
Maybe I'll have a look
around town myself.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.281
Do not underestimate
the women in this Tower.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.076
Each of them has her own goal,
her own agenda,

11:41.159 --> 11:43.286
her own pride and ambition.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.915
As powerful as you are,
these women have spent decades

11:46.998 --> 11:50.127
honing their strengths,
masking their weaknesses.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.170
And when news spreads
of your presence here--

11:52.254 --> 11:53.547
which it will--

11:53.630 --> 11:56.550
you'll be expected to become
a Novice immediately.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.844
And if you're not careful,
those Tower politics

11:58.927 --> 12:00.303
will eat you alive.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.851
If I'm as powerful
as you say I am...

12:05.934 --> 12:09.896
maybe it's you, Aes Sedai,
who shouldn't underestimate me.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.414
It's all right to be afraid.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.085
You reached out
and you touched the Source.

12:32.169 --> 12:36.173
You saw how small you are
in comparison to it.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.508
And how great you are

12:38.592 --> 12:41.887
in comparison
to those you've always loved.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.684
how do you fit into the world?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.270
Can you ever go back
to being who you were?

12:53.440 --> 12:57.319
I know because I felt it,
too, the first time.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.989
And the answer is no.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.618
You'll never be the same.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.913
But it's time that you saw that
for the gift it is.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.209
Now, stay here.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.211
Do not speak to anyone.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.963
And I will try and protect you
as best I can.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.431
And when I've found
your friends...

13:26.515 --> 13:28.558
I will bring you to them.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.135
It's a little hypocritical,
you know.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.720
What is?

14:05.804 --> 14:07.347
Preaching nonviolence

14:07.430 --> 14:09.224
and then letting
your pets slaughter

14:09.307 --> 14:12.435
- anything you come across.
-

14:12.519 --> 14:14.563
Violence is in us all.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.606
The Way of the Leaf
isn't about denying that.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.858
It's about accepting it.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.735
Maybe.

14:20.819 --> 14:24.990
But one more turnip curry,
and I'll be joining the dogs.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.535
What are you two talking about?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.537
- You. Obviously.
-

14:30.620 --> 14:32.122
Only good things.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.083
Did you see?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.960
The White Tower.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.507
We made it.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.968
You think they're there already?

14:48.430 --> 14:50.140
I do.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.976
Seems you won't have to suffer
through turnip curry

14:53.059 --> 14:55.186
- much longer.
-

14:55.270 --> 14:57.397
- Whoa!
- What's going on?

14:57.480 --> 15:00.233
- Why are we stopping?
-

15:05.697 --> 15:07.699
The false Dragon.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.993
Don't know anything about him,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.746
but we've been in the grass
for months now.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.880
Those two.
Bring them to me.

15:21.963 --> 15:25.342
You can't just take
our people.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.344
They're not your people.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.264
They've eaten our food
and shared our fire.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.479
Do you want your new friends
to suffer?

15:37.562 --> 15:39.814
If they don't wish
to go with you,

15:39.898 --> 15:41.941
you can't have them.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.610
I can't?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.655
That's a strange word to be
coming out of a Tinker's mouth.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.076
And how exactly
do you plan on stopping me?

16:00.669 --> 16:04.839
The Way of the Leaf
against the Way of the Light.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.132
Hmm.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.307
Hurry. This way.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.815
You can cover the Light

16:21.898 --> 16:23.900
with the palm of a child's hand,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.986
but a Leaf,
even if you crush it, bury it,

16:27.070 --> 16:30.865
burn it, it becomes a part
of the earth...

16:30.949 --> 16:32.617
and the air.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.716
We can't just leave them!

16:47.799 --> 16:50.677
Whitecloaks may be bastards,
but they won't kill Tuatha'an.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.929
Come on, hurry.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.894
Come on, this way.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.522
There's a village nearby
who've always been good to us.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.278
Aah! Aram! Aram!

17:26.838 --> 17:28.965
<i>The Karaethon Cycle.</i>

17:30.133 --> 17:33.219
Oh.
I didn't even hear you come in.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.223
- Stay back!
- Oh, dear.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.642
You humans are very excitable.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.187
My first day in Tar Valon,

17:42.270 --> 17:44.856
I could not believe the uproar.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.317
Children cried, women screamed,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.945
and a mob chased me
all the way across the city,

17:51.029 --> 17:52.906
waving knives.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.326
I'm afraid I was almost
beginning to get a little upset.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.663
I tell you, it was not for this
I left the Stedding.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.750
Stedding?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.168
You're an ogre?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.128
Ogier.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.547
Loial, son of Arent,
son of Halan.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.382
And who are you?

18:12.717 --> 18:14.844
Rand.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.304
Rand al'Thor.

18:16.387 --> 18:20.141
Your name sings in my ears,
Rand al'Thor.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.520
It is quite exciting
to meet an Aielman.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.396
I've read much of your people.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.607
I'm not an Aielman.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.819
Really? Red hair is
one of the few physical traits

18:30.902 --> 18:33.112
that can help you work out
where a human is from.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.989
I'm from the Two Rivers.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.200
An Aielman from the Two Rivers?

18:37.283 --> 18:39.160
I'm not an Aielman.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.037
An Aielman from the Two Rivers

18:41.120 --> 18:44.165
who insists that
he is not an Aielman.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.584
That is very odd.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.670
I like oddities.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.385
You know this book?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.138
Yes.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.684
Why would <i>The Travels of
Jain Farstrider</i> make you sad?

19:02.767 --> 19:04.686
It's a first-class adventure.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.437
No, I...

19:07.730 --> 19:10.650
A girl I know used to read
this book every day.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.945
- Thought she was Jain herself
reincarnated.
-

19:14.028 --> 19:16.239
Well, that would be
quite unlikely.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.699
With all the humans all...

19:17.782 --> 19:20.076
It's just something
she thought, you know.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.371
I see. I forget how frivolous
you humans can be

19:23.454 --> 19:24.706
with your thoughts.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.083
Where is she now, this girl?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.710
Or is she a woman?

19:28.793 --> 19:30.962
You age so quickly.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.672
I'm not sure.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.299
I came to Tar Valon

19:34.382 --> 19:36.467
because she was heading
to the White Tower,

19:36.551 --> 19:38.177
- but...
-

19:38.261 --> 19:39.762
What's going on?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.932
The Aes Sedai
are returning from battle

19:43.016 --> 19:45.727
with the false Dragon,
parading him through the streets

19:45.810 --> 19:48.646
to show the people
the dangers of madness

19:48.730 --> 19:50.315
and hunger for power.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.774
How far a man can...

19:51.858 --> 19:54.485
- Sorry, I-I've got to go.
- To the procession?

19:54.569 --> 19:56.571
I'll come with you.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.740
Just give me a moment
to gather my things.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.575
I'll see you out there.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.662
Always in such a rush,
these humans.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.290
Never taking time
to properly prepare

20:07.373 --> 20:09.167
for what they're walking into.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.297
Thanks for saving me a seat.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.176
They're bringing in
the false Dragon.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.680
<i>They say he was a man
who could channel,</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:05.848
<i>that it drove him mad.</i>

21:17.318 --> 21:19.529
Kill the Dragon!

21:23.700 --> 21:26.244
False Dragon!

21:42.552 --> 21:45.096
Mat? Mat?

21:56.399 --> 21:59.027
Let's make a deal.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.611
All right?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.990
All right.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.786
If it turns out
it's one of us...

22:08.870 --> 22:11.581
that you or me can...

22:11.664 --> 22:13.374
channel...

22:16.794 --> 22:19.839
...we won't let each other
become like that.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.133
- Mat...
- I'm serious.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.136
I don't give a shit
about this prophecy nonsense.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.597
Aes Sedai, Dragons, whatever.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.599
- I won't be like that.
- You won't.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.683
You don't know that.

22:41.069 --> 22:42.361
Promise me.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.076
I promise.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.753
You'd do the same for me?

23:00.171 --> 23:02.090
You bet.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.313
How was the procession?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.273
He'll be picking tomato
out of his hair for weeks.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.275
It was all worth it
to see Liandrin's face

23:21.359 --> 23:23.820
when she accidentally got hit
with a radish.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.329
Haven't worn white
since my father's funeral.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.001
I hated him, you know.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.923
After he died, I...

23:44.006 --> 23:47.885
used to go out, piss drunk
before I even got to the bar,

23:47.969 --> 23:52.140
fight the smallest,
weakest guy in there...

23:52.223 --> 23:53.975
and beat him.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.270
Then I started picking on
people who could fight back,

23:57.353 --> 23:59.856
half hoping they would just...

24:01.482 --> 24:03.484
...put a stop to me.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.737
That's when I met Kerene.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.492
Stupid young boy
with a death wish,

24:11.576 --> 24:15.079
facing off against an Aes Sedai.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.915
She just laughed at me...

24:17.999 --> 24:20.293
and then bought me a drink.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.881
Somehow, we became friends.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.092
Or rather, she gave me the honor
of becoming her friend.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.975
And when she needed a Warder,
she was already so powerful

24:36.058 --> 24:40.479
that she could have had
anybody she wanted, but...

24:40.563 --> 24:42.732
she asked for me.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.152
I couldn't believe it.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.654
I knew I wasn't worthy.

24:51.157 --> 24:55.119
I told her to reconsider,
but she... wouldn't.

24:55.203 --> 24:58.623
She just rolled her eyes at me,
and that was that.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.502
We bonded...

25:05.379 --> 25:07.924
...and I had to become
worthy of her.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.018
My dad tried
to kill me when I was 12.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.979
So... stop your whining.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.860
White Tower gave me the first
real family I ever had.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.239
You're right.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.533
It's good that you lads
always have each other.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.747
Probably ten more Warders,
if Alanna had her way.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.845
Including you, old friend.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.723
If you bond another Aes Sedai...

25:57.807 --> 26:00.393
First, you lose Moiraine,
and then tell me how easy it is

26:00.476 --> 26:03.145
to jump from one woman
to the next.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.790
It's time.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.237
Come on, now.
Put your back into it.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.285
Open your eyes, child.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.914
That's better. All covered up.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.917
Hands.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.930
Bring him in.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.893
- Perrin!
-

29:28.976 --> 29:31.395
If you care for her, boy,
don't fight.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.358
Sir, please...

29:36.442 --> 29:37.776
Call me Child Valda.

29:37.860 --> 29:41.113
The authority is
in the Light, not me.

29:43.199 --> 29:44.575
Child Valda,

29:44.658 --> 29:47.077
we are not who you think.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.704
W-We're nothing. We're no...

29:48.787 --> 29:52.249
We are all someone important
under the Light.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.210
But you're right.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.212
You're not who
I thought you were.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.381
An Aes Sedai would have tried
to channel already,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.176
so I would have taken
your hands already.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.723
You know, one of those witches
once told me

30:07.806 --> 30:10.100
that you don't actually need
your hands to channel.

30:10.184 --> 30:14.188
That the use of the hands,
of any motions or words,

30:14.271 --> 30:16.482
is just a crutch.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.317
I can't channel.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.946
There. We've proved it, then.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.114
Because Aes Sedai
certainly cannot lie,

30:24.198 --> 30:27.576
as much as they're able
to twist the truth.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.871
So let's say
you're not an Aes Sedai,

30:30.955 --> 30:33.207
and that this boy-- Perrin?--

30:33.290 --> 30:35.209
is not your Warder.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.504
The Light must have brought you
before me for a reason.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.297
Twice.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.716
The Light never does anything
without a purpose.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.009
I assure you, sir...

30:44.093 --> 30:45.803
Child Valda.

30:48.973 --> 30:50.641
Child Valda.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.020
I'm just a girl
from a mountain village

30:55.104 --> 30:57.565
who should have never left.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.650
Please, just let us go. Please.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.904
But you can touch the One Power.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.864
I know you can.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.783
- So stop me from killing you.
-

31:14.206 --> 31:16.166
No.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.377
I'm sorry?

31:18.460 --> 31:21.005
I can't channel.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.424
You said yourself
you're sworn to the Light.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.801
And a man of the Light
cannot kill a girl

31:25.884 --> 31:28.095
who's done nothing wrong.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.180
And what
makes you think

31:30.264 --> 31:33.017
that I'm a man who stays true
to his oaths?

31:33.100 --> 31:36.437
That I won't just bleed you out
right here and now?

31:38.731 --> 31:41.609
If you're going to do it,
then do it.

31:42.610 --> 31:46.030
But know this--
I'll come back in my next life

31:46.113 --> 31:49.116
and split you from head to tail
like the pig you are!

31:50.743 --> 31:53.579
You would have made
a strong Aes Sedai.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.790
A wonderful ring to add
to my collection.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.199
Don't. No! No!

32:32.618 --> 32:33.952
Why are you doing this?!

32:34.036 --> 32:35.412
Because we humans

32:35.496 --> 32:38.040
are meant to be of this Earth,

32:38.123 --> 32:41.960
to struggle and fight
for everything we have.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.962
The Creator never meant for us

32:44.046 --> 32:46.382
- to have access
to so much power.
-

32:47.800 --> 32:51.095
You witches make a mockery
of our very existence,

32:51.178 --> 32:54.390
walking like gods amongst men.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.600
-
- The idea that the One Power

32:56.684 --> 32:59.895
comes from anywhere
other than the Dark is absurd.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.192
So I have been called
to stamp it out.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.070
-
- Woman by woman

33:08.153 --> 33:09.697
by woman.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.202
Channel for me, girl,

33:15.285 --> 33:17.871
and I'll kill you
and let the boy go.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.542
Don't channel,

33:21.625 --> 33:24.086
and I'll kill the boy
and let you go.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.592
I'll leave you two to discuss.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.558
Decide which one of you
it will be.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.792
Stepin.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.253
Heard you'd been
locked up here, too.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.089
-
- I wondered...

34:09.173 --> 34:12.468
if I could get a bit more
of that tea you had.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.303
For sleeping.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.388
It's not really
goats' tongues, is it?

34:19.349 --> 34:21.560
Goatstongue is a plant.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.520
- Oh.
- Mm.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.820
Are you still
having trouble sleeping?

34:31.904 --> 34:33.363
I, uh...

34:34.782 --> 34:36.033
I...

34:37.618 --> 34:40.496
I lie there...

34:40.579 --> 34:45.334
and, uh, just as I'm
about to drift off,

34:45.417 --> 34:47.544
the pain goes away.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.547
- Good.
- No.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.967
That's the only thing
I have left of her.

34:54.051 --> 34:55.928
The pain.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.599
I'm not ready
to let go of it yet.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.359
Don't worry.

35:11.944 --> 35:15.155
I promise you
the pain will never go away.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.537
Thank you.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.582
Escaped, did you?

36:12.296 --> 36:15.257
They're almost as old
as the Tower itself.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.467
Representing the tens of thousands of men

36:17.551 --> 36:21.430
who bonded themselves
to my sisters.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.560
Standing guard
outside the Hall...

36:26.643 --> 36:29.354
in death as they did in life.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.192
Reds don't have Warders.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.571
No. Never.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.406
Because you hate men.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.411
Is that a question
or a statement?

36:46.955 --> 36:49.416
Some of my Red sisters, perhaps.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.002
Women hold the One Power,

36:52.085 --> 36:55.756
but men still control
much of this world.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.344
And they are rarely kind
to little girls

37:00.427 --> 37:03.639
who show a spark
of being greater than they are.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.311
Well, now you've escaped
Moiraine's cage,

37:09.394 --> 37:13.023
you should enjoy
your freedom. Hmm?

37:14.066 --> 37:18.362
That way leads to the library,

37:18.445 --> 37:20.781
then on to the gardens.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.202
The persimmons are in season.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.455
Mmm.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.058
Rand al'Thor.

37:48.141 --> 37:51.728
Did you know
that Ogier have access

37:51.812 --> 37:54.106
to the White Tower grounds?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.899
Um, no.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.192
But why...

37:57.275 --> 38:00.445
I went there and found
the woman you spoke of.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.823
By the Light.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.033
The braid is a distinct
rite of passage

38:05.117 --> 38:06.743
- in the Two Rivers.
- We thought you were dead.

38:06.827 --> 38:08.245
It was
really very simple.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.830
Where's Egwene? And Perrin?

38:09.913 --> 38:11.498
On their way, I think.

38:13.417 --> 38:14.543
Oh...

38:16.545 --> 38:18.505
What happened to him?

38:20.465 --> 38:22.009
Nynaeve?

38:22.092 --> 38:24.678
Who else could I be?

38:26.096 --> 38:27.764
You're alive.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.641
So are you.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.143
Barely.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.563
Show me your tongue.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.189
Don't touch me!

38:41.153 --> 38:43.363
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.199
Sleep, Mat.

38:46.283 --> 38:48.118
You need to rest.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.084
I think he can channel.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.466
Have you seen it?

39:02.549 --> 39:05.218
No, but he's losing himself.

39:05.302 --> 39:08.472
I know Moiraine said we should
come to her at the White Tower.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.349
I don't know
if we can trust her.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.519
We saw what the Aes Sedai did
to the false Dragon.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.196
You've done well.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.156
To bring him here.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.241
To take care of him.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.746
We don't need the Aes Sedai.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.082
We're Two Rivers folk.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.917
I'll heal what I can,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.170
and when Egwene and Perrin
arrive, we'll sort out the rest.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.588
Together.

39:43.757 --> 39:45.842
I haven't seen her
in a month now.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.263
She's alive.

39:57.938 --> 40:01.733
You know, when Egwene
was little, barely ten,

40:01.817 --> 40:05.987
her parents brought her to us,
the Old Wisdom and I.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.157
She had an infection
already set into her muscles.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.410
They were cramping so badly

40:12.494 --> 40:15.288
that her legs were bent
backwards on themselves.

40:15.372 --> 40:18.375
That's why they call it
breakbone fever.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.378
Usually before the person dies,

40:21.461 --> 40:24.798
they snap their own legs
and arms in half.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.678
The Old Wisdom, she, um...

40:29.761 --> 40:31.721
she didn't know what to do.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.644
So she started making a tea
to ease her passing.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.605
But I couldn't.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.025
So I took Egwene's hands,

40:44.109 --> 40:47.362
and she held on so tight.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.907
She looked at me and she said,
"I'm not ready."

40:53.493 --> 40:55.495
She was so small.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.957
She just lay there
the whole night

40:59.040 --> 41:01.418
while her own body tried
to break itself in half.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.505
And she didn't cry.

41:05.589 --> 41:08.008
Not once.

41:08.091 --> 41:11.344
And she refused
the Wisdom's tea.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.976
In the morning,
the fever had broken.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.729
Not her.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.692
Sounds about right.

41:29.863 --> 41:33.783
Egwene is many things,
but above all else,

41:33.867 --> 41:35.619
she's unbreakable.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.556
-
- Egwene, stop.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.523
If it has to be one of us,
it should be me.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.360
No.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.864
This is what I deserve.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.159
Laila.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.536
- I killed her.
- No.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.288
No, Laila's death
was not your fault.

42:20.372 --> 42:23.124
Yes, it was!

42:25.335 --> 42:28.380
We were fighting
them off together.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.257
The Trollocs.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.260
Then I killed one.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.974
But then I heard another
from behind me,

42:39.057 --> 42:41.518
and I swung
with all my strength.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.233
But it was her.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.737
My own hands.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.407
My own ax.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.537
I killed her.

43:02.789 --> 43:04.833
I killed my wife.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.423
This is what I deserve.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.509
No.

43:19.139 --> 43:21.057
Have we reached a decision?

43:28.231 --> 43:29.858
Very well.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.152
No decision is still a decision.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.613
Eventually,
the boy will bleed out.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.872
It was an accident, Perrin.

43:43.955 --> 43:44.914
Not your fault.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.668
And it may take you
your whole life

43:48.752 --> 43:51.588
- to realize that, but you will.
-

43:53.590 --> 43:55.467
I promise.

43:57.552 --> 43:58.845
You will.

44:04.809 --> 44:08.438
No. Egwene, no!

44:10.065 --> 44:11.691
Drift.

44:14.027 --> 44:16.654
Just drift.

44:16.738 --> 44:18.114
Ah.

44:18.198 --> 44:20.033
There you are.

44:44.099 --> 44:47.268
You'll find me harder to kill
than that, girl.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.354
Especially with a flame so small.

44:51.439 --> 44:54.734
In truth, I was expecting more.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.324
Light protect me.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.371
What are you?!

45:14.421 --> 45:15.964
-
- Let's go.

45:27.392 --> 45:28.726
Keep moving!

45:31.312 --> 45:32.856
You two, stop.

45:36.693 --> 45:38.194
Come on. Come on.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.911
- He won't hurt us.
- How do you know?

45:51.207 --> 45:52.834
Come on. Go.

46:03.052 --> 46:05.763
You heading to bed, sister?

46:05.847 --> 46:07.974
I'm surprised you remember
where your chamber is.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.851
How long has it been? Two years?

46:12.020 --> 46:15.482
And to return with such a prize.

46:15.565 --> 46:17.692
Where is Nynaeve?

46:20.153 --> 46:22.739
Safely hidden away, I assume.

46:22.822 --> 46:26.493
No doubt she's resting
after her long journey.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.336
You look a little worse
for wear, too.

46:42.842 --> 46:45.637
You know, the trouble with...

46:45.720 --> 46:48.223
always coming and going,
Moiraine,

46:48.306 --> 46:50.266
is that when Nynaeve
becomes a Novice--

46:50.350 --> 46:52.644
and despite
her distressing mistrust

46:52.727 --> 46:56.773
of Aes Sedai,
she will become a Novice--

46:56.856 --> 47:00.151
you won't be here to guide her.

47:01.903 --> 47:03.446
A girl with her raw talent

47:03.530 --> 47:05.114
and lack of control
will need mentoring.

47:05.198 --> 47:07.116
And you think
she will choose Red?

47:07.200 --> 47:08.910
The Wisdom of the Two Rivers,

47:08.993 --> 47:10.870
after her first channeling
healed the dying?

47:10.954 --> 47:13.289
Mm. Our Yellow sisters
will be desperate

47:13.373 --> 47:14.916
to get their hands
on her, it's true.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.751
Hmm.

47:17.919 --> 47:20.463
But there's a certain...

47:20.547 --> 47:22.924
force of will she cannot hide.

47:23.967 --> 47:25.885
A sense that the world
would be better

47:25.969 --> 47:28.680
if everyone obeyed the rules.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.515
Her rules.

47:31.558 --> 47:32.934
One thing
she doesn't share, though,

47:33.017 --> 47:35.645
- is your contempt for men.
-

47:35.728 --> 47:38.231
So I suggest you look
for converts elsewhere.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.910
Not many people
still make offerings

47:50.994 --> 47:53.079
to ward off the Forsaken.

47:54.122 --> 47:56.624
These belonged to my mother.

47:56.708 --> 48:00.503
The only thing left in her house
when she died.

48:00.587 --> 48:03.506
And who are you trying
to keep away?

48:03.590 --> 48:07.176
Ishamael...

48:07.260 --> 48:09.053
Father of Lies.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.807
I need to see clearly now.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.892
I need to see the truth.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.981
Do you believe any of it?

48:20.064 --> 48:22.942
Think they can still touch
our world?

48:23.026 --> 48:25.903
The Forsaken sold
their souls to the Dark One

48:25.987 --> 48:28.114
for eternal life.

48:29.449 --> 48:31.868
Even if the last Dragon
sealed them away...

48:33.661 --> 48:36.539
- Eternity's a very long time.
- Hmm.

48:36.623 --> 48:38.458
A very long time.

48:43.171 --> 48:45.506
Hey.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.592
Enough of this.

48:48.718 --> 48:51.137
-
- I'll stay with you
till morning.

48:54.474 --> 48:56.934
Do you think Stepin
will accept your offer?

48:57.977 --> 48:59.729
I don't know.

49:01.230 --> 49:03.524
When a Warder loses
his Aes Sedai,

49:03.608 --> 49:06.069
the pain is so deep.

49:06.152 --> 49:09.822
It's almost like
he's swallowed her death.

49:15.411 --> 49:18.414
I read once there's a way
to release the bond.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.709
Oh.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.339
There, now, sister.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.132
Don't do that.

49:28.216 --> 49:31.344
Lan has nothing to worry about.

49:33.221 --> 49:36.641
You'll be here with us
a long time yet.

49:41.604 --> 49:44.399
What have you been doing
out there all these years?

49:46.859 --> 49:49.153
Now, unless
you've made it a habit

49:49.237 --> 49:51.155
to use this as your dining room,

49:51.239 --> 49:53.991
I'm assuming you have
a reason for coming.

49:55.702 --> 49:59.247
I got word that the Amyrlin's
returning from Caemlyn.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.874
She's summoned us to the Hall...

50:01.958 --> 50:03.960
to answer for Logain.

50:05.795 --> 50:08.548
She's out for blood,
looking for someone to blame.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.260
Siuan Sanche is many things...

50:12.343 --> 50:15.763
but she's never turned
on a sister without cause.

50:17.390 --> 50:22.270
Moiraine, this place isn't
what it was when you left.

50:22.353 --> 50:27.525
You're one of the only sisters
strong enough to challenge her.

50:27.608 --> 50:29.944
But I have no designs
on the Seat.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.904
I never have.

50:31.988 --> 50:36.534
No one has any idea
what you have designs on.

50:37.577 --> 50:40.121
Liandrin's strength is growing.

50:40.204 --> 50:42.665
More and more sisters
are listening to her,

50:42.749 --> 50:44.876
and not just the Reds.

50:45.918 --> 50:47.962
All I'm saying is,

50:48.045 --> 50:50.173
for someone
who's rarely in the Tower,

50:50.256 --> 50:54.218
you have two
very powerful enemies here.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.305
Be careful, my friend.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.851
Thank you for the warning.

51:12.779 --> 51:16.073
One day, you'll have to trust
someone with your secrets,

51:16.157 --> 51:18.284
or they'll scour you
from the inside out

51:18.367 --> 51:21.662
and leave you bare as this room.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.668
Good night, Moiraine.

51:56.989 --> 51:59.033
Well...

51:59.116 --> 52:02.119
maybe when I'm bonded
with Alanna and...

52:02.203 --> 52:04.539
feel her bond to...

52:04.622 --> 52:07.875
Ihvon and Maksim, but...

52:07.959 --> 52:10.670
still...

52:10.753 --> 52:14.006
I don't know, I've, uh...

52:14.090 --> 52:16.717
never been with a man.

52:18.094 --> 52:19.679
- Two men.
-

52:19.762 --> 52:21.973
Certainly not two men.

52:22.056 --> 52:25.059
But hey, there's a first time
for everything.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.812
Well, you're...
you're assuming they want you.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.272
What's not to want?

52:29.355 --> 52:32.441
Huh?

52:37.989 --> 52:39.991
Tell me about the Wisdom.

52:41.242 --> 52:43.494
Nothing to tell.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.621
Because you've never been
a talker.

52:45.705 --> 52:47.665
But I have eyes.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.502
She touched the One Power
for the first time

52:51.586 --> 52:52.920
to save your life.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.964
And barely spoken to me since.

52:55.047 --> 52:58.009
She's stubborn.
Knows her own mind.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.471
Knows she's falling for you.

53:02.555 --> 53:04.557
That's a bad idea for her.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.101
Love's usually
a bad idea.

53:07.184 --> 53:11.439
Still, we allow it
to happen, or...

53:11.522 --> 53:13.941
this life would be intolerable.

53:16.068 --> 53:18.070
Well, I can tolerate a lot.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.408
I know.

56:03.819 --> 56:06.405
Al'Lan Mandragoran.

56:18.459 --> 56:20.127
Lay your hand on him.

56:29.428 --> 56:31.847
Relieve us of our grief.
