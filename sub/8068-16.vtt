Hey!

01:00.761 --> 01:02.663
Give those back
you little booger!

01:02.763 --> 01:03.897
I'm not a booger!

01:03.997 --> 01:05.866
Give 'em back, I said!

01:05.966 --> 01:07.335
No!

01:07.435 --> 01:08.936
Give 'em back you little thief!

01:09.036 --> 01:11.872
Give 'em back, I said!

01:16.277 --> 01:18.078
They're my sunglasses!

01:20.548 --> 01:22.250

- They're mine!

01:22.350 --> 01:24.385
They're mine.

01:24.485 --> 01:28.822
Ooh I'm gonna be, like, the
most awesome kid at the mall.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.160
Well, aside from you my
gorgeous and eternally hip,

01:32.260 --> 01:34.528
young daughter.

01:34.628 --> 01:39.933
Thanks, my loving mother-- who
is still living in Woodstock.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.835
OK, come on everybody,
let's get a move on.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.036
Come on, come on.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.905
Becky, come on, we're
leaving in five minutes--

01:45.005 --> 01:48.108

01:48.209 --> 01:50.578
BECKY: We can't go until
I find my magazine.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.280
I need the picture
of that dress!

01:52.380 --> 01:54.848
Don't you have it
engraved in your memory?

01:54.948 --> 01:55.749
Dan!

01:58.719 --> 01:59.920
Are you dead?

02:00.020 --> 02:01.455
DAN: Yes.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.191
Well, that's too
bad, honey, because you

02:03.291 --> 02:04.225
still gotta buy shoes.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.963
OK, now where are we meeting?

02:10.063 --> 02:12.200
In the bookstore
by Call It Salad.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.334
At 4 o'clock sharp.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.903
Oh, you're just a
little memory bank.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.240
You give us the same speech
every time we go to the mall.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.674
No jumping on waterbeds.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.975
No perfume fights.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.012
No falafel.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.947
Look at that dress.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.316
DJ, give it a rest.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.550
This is the one
I want for that One

Enchanted Evening dance.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.820
Whoa, pretty snazzy
threads for an evening

02:32.920 --> 02:35.523
that's gonna end at 9:30.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.424
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.491
Hi.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.960
Hey, Jackie, I found
the dress I want.

02:40.060 --> 02:40.861
Ouch!

02:40.961 --> 02:42.596
Hot stuff!

02:42.696 --> 02:45.199
When I walk into that gym,
everyone's going to notice me.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.536
Yeah, and then
they're going to puke.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.904
Come on, Mom, I want
to get over to the mall.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.039
You better take
her temperature.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.442
I think she's got dress fever.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.544
Hey, if I don't get this
dress I'll kill myself.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.980
Honey, bad luck to kill
yourself before the biggest

03:00.080 --> 03:01.782
sale of the year.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.885
Lanford Mall Spring-a-thon.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.887
They're having
this awesome thing

03:06.987 --> 03:08.289
called the Blue-light-a-thon.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.458
If a blue light flashes while
you are touching something

03:10.558 --> 03:11.759
you get it for free!

03:11.859 --> 03:13.361
With my luck I'll
be touching myself.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.365
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.332
Me too.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.300
Me three!

03:19.400 --> 03:21.969
So funny I forgot to laugh.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.537
Are you looking
for anything special?

03:23.637 --> 03:27.074
No, just the usual
Lanford excitement.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.477
Roseanne, what's
wrong with these?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.412
Why are you telling
me I need new shoes?

03:31.512 --> 03:35.182
Because she lives
to torment you--

03:35.283 --> 03:38.319
like I do!

03:38.419 --> 03:41.855
Thanks so for sharing.

03:41.955 --> 03:42.923
Now go home.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.992
No, no, no, I'm coming
along to make sure

03:45.092 --> 03:46.527
you get the shoes because
I'm tired of hearing

03:46.627 --> 03:48.496
Roseanne complain about it.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.931
Mom, DJ and Darlene
are killing each other.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.401
What's the bad news?

03:53.501 --> 03:56.870
[band playing]

04:05.946 --> 04:08.449
I love the live music.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.150
You should soak it in
now because they ain't

04:10.250 --> 04:12.486
gonna be live much longer.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.489
You know, I've been to a
lot of 'a-thons in my day,

04:15.589 --> 04:19.693
but I must say this is the
'a-thon to end all 'a-thons.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.330
Come on, Mom, I want to
get over to The Ultimate.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.097
We got to wait for
your dad to park the car

04:24.197 --> 04:25.566
and then we got to
hear the epic saga.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.538
Mom, can I have a dollar
for a Cherry Guzzle?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.005
I thought you brought money.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.342
I did, but I'm not
spending it on food.

04:34.442 --> 04:39.313
Well, Cherry Guzzle ain't
food it's toxic waste.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.280
Please Mom!

04:40.381 --> 04:42.182
I'm dying of thirst.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.519
All right, I guess
your life's worth a buck.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.088
(SARCASTICALLY) Thanks.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.858
How come it takes Dad
so long to park the car?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.893
Cause he's got to drive
around 20 minutes to find

04:52.993 --> 04:54.595
a spot two inches
closer to the one

04:54.695 --> 04:57.097
he found ten minutes before.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.400
Mother, I just know
that at this very moment,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.669
some other girl in The Ultimate
is buying the exact same dress

05:01.769 --> 05:02.703
that I want.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.537
Honey, what did I
tell you about being

05:03.637 --> 05:05.739
paranoid schizophrenic?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.841
Mom, this is the
dance of the year.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.076
OK, go ahead in The Ultimate.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.611
I'll meet you there
in a couple minutes.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.279
Thanks.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.847
I'm keeping the charge card.

05:13.947 --> 05:14.748
All right.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.221
Wow, it must be hard
to shop with someone's

05:21.321 --> 05:23.391

05:23.491 --> 05:24.792
Oh my God.

05:25.793 --> 05:26.827
That's Stan Harmony.

great set of pecs.

So maybe he's here
for the pec-a-thon.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.205

advantage of you?

05:39.272 --> 05:43.110

me you were coming!

06:58.151 --> 07:00.020
Supposed to be here already.

07:00.120 --> 07:00.921
OK, honey.

07:07.595 --> 07:11.264
Forget it, your
butt's too big.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.866
Would you get out of here?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.802
Why don't you buy this one
with the big bow on the back.

07:14.902 --> 07:18.872
That ought to cover
the Continental Divide.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.674

daughter to get lost.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.919
You just had a Guzzle.

07:32.019 --> 07:32.820
Half a Guzzle.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.721
It was warm.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.955
I threw it out.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.525
Mom, give her
the dollar, please.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.425
All right.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.728
Now that's it till college.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.496
Thanks.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.497
Hey, this is cute.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.799
Look it!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.501
Mother, that is
not the fashion

07:47.601 --> 07:49.537
statement I want to make.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.005
Oh, well 110 bucks ain't
the financial statement

07:52.105 --> 07:54.608
I want to make.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.710
Well, have you
found anything yet?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.012
No, just a bunch of clothes.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.014
Well, what exactly
are you looking for?

08:01.114 --> 08:02.182
Well, we're
looking for something

08:02.282 --> 08:03.517
that doesn't cost
nothing, and that'll

08:03.617 --> 08:06.520
change my daughter's life.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.821
Something like this.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.389
Oh that's a fabulous look.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.460
Let me show you some
things I have in the back.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.494
Hey, you.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.063
I looked all over the place.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.531
I couldn't find nothing.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.867
Oh you poor baby.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.869
It must be hard to find
shoes when you're browsing

08:21.969 --> 08:25.639
around in House of Chainsaws.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.308
Roseanne, there's no way I'm
gonna blow an entire Saturday

08:28.408 --> 08:30.578
sitting in some shoe
store waiting to be waited

08:30.678 --> 08:31.945
on by some salesman
who's already

08:32.045 --> 08:35.448
got 200,000 other customers who
are waiting to be waited on.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.385
I ain't buyin' shoes.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.286
That's it.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.125
End of discussion.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.695
And get a couple extra
pairs of laces too.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.532
Mom, look at this dress.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.433
Wow.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.334
Can I have it?

08:54.434 --> 08:55.368
Please?

08:55.468 --> 08:57.104
Please, please,
please, please, please?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.505
Well, first you
gotta say please.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.475
How much is it?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.277
79.95.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.279
Mom, if you buy me the
this dress I promise you I'll

09:06.379 --> 09:07.948
never ask for another thing.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.250
Now, Becky, we discussed
price before we left home.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.484
Mom, all my friends
are going to be

09:11.585 --> 09:13.020
wearing dresses like this!

09:13.120 --> 09:15.088
If I don't have one it will look
stupid, and none of the guys

09:15.188 --> 09:16.156
will want to dance with me.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.659
So dance with the girls.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.728
Come on, let's go look
at something else.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.829
I don't want anything else.

09:21.929 --> 09:22.830
I want this.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.865
You know, this
is an investment.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.366
In a few years,
your other daughter

09:26.466 --> 09:27.701
will be able to wear it.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.269
Well, for 80 bucks
our whole family

09:29.369 --> 09:30.638
has to be able to wear it.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.711
Come on, honey, let's
go look at something--

09:37.811 --> 09:38.879
I don't want anything!

09:38.979 --> 09:39.847
Ever again!

09:39.947 --> 09:40.948
For as long as I live!

09:45.485 --> 09:46.286
Thanks!

09:46.386 --> 09:47.354
You've been very helpful.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.727
DARLENE: DJ!

09:53.827 --> 09:55.696
I want to see the bunnies!

09:59.232 --> 10:00.634
I went to your sister's house.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.869
You're going to
go to my mother's.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.270
All right, but I'm not eating.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.609
Best 21.95 you'll ever spend.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.378
Do you come with it?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.446
The Porta-Shaper
toned my entire body--

10:13.546 --> 10:14.648
legs, chest, arms.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.549
It can do the same for you.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.885
You mean if I
workout with this

10:17.985 --> 10:19.119
I'll look exactly like you?

10:19.219 --> 10:20.420
Absolutely.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.390
And I won't need
surgery or anything?

10:23.490 --> 10:24.357
Come up here.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.425
I'll show you how it works.
- No.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.326
Come on.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.360
No.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.430
[laughs] I feel a
little overdressed.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.233
Maybe I should take
some of this off.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.502
Well, now, we don't want
to get too healthy too quick.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.870
Now what are your goals?

10:36.970 --> 10:40.473
Umm, to get the
hell out of Lanford.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.608
You know what?

10:41.709 --> 10:43.811
You sound a lot like
me five years ago.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.012
I was a factory worker--

10:45.112 --> 10:46.847
Mansfield, Ohio.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.082
I work in a factory.

10:49.182 --> 10:54.054
I was 32, 128 pounds,
bored senseless, stuck.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.188
You know what I'm saying?

10:55.288 --> 10:57.290
I mean, I hated getting
up in the morning

10:57.390 --> 10:59.359
I know exactly
what you're saying.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.229
It was April 2nd, I
opened my eyes that morning

11:02.329 --> 11:04.364
and the first thing I
saw was a cigarette butt

11:04.464 --> 11:06.066
floating in a bottle of beer.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.168
Right then it hit me--

11:08.268 --> 11:10.103
MAVEN.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.705
Maven.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.574
Motivation, attitude,
vitamins, exercise, nutrition--

11:14.674 --> 11:15.475
MAVEN.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.010
The result, the Porta-Shaper.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.912
You can do it too!

11:19.012 --> 11:19.813
Well, that's you.

11:19.913 --> 11:20.748
I'm here.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.682
I'm stuck.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.484
Hey, I was you.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.653
I just got unstuck.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.823
Hey, are these things
gonna make me nauseous?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.725
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.793
I'm sorry, what?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.094
You see, I got
this problem with

11:34.194 --> 11:36.363
my stomach and these things
kind of-- what about gas?

11:38.732 --> 11:40.300
MALL ANNOUNCER: Attention,
Spring-a-thon shoppers,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.670
will customer Buddy Jaffe
please return to Lanford

11:43.771 --> 11:46.373
National Bank on level three.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.440
How'd you do?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.341
Oh swell.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.477
My daughter's not talking to me.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.079
Where is your new dress?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.546
We didn't buy one.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.048
Cost 80 bucks.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.984
Lanford.

11:57.084 --> 11:57.885
Lanford.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.521
Cities in Illinois.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.494
Roseanne, everything
in this town stinks.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.997
You'll never be able to
buy Becky that new dress.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.499
I'll never be able to
buy my kids a new dress.

12:12.599 --> 12:16.503
Lanford's a big cesspool and
we're all condemned to sit

12:16.603 --> 12:19.739
here and drown in the sewage.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.607
Something wrong?

12:24.377 --> 12:25.178
Yeah.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.079
I'm 32.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.315
I weigh 110 pounds.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.551
I work in a crummy factory, and
I'm stuck here like a cigarette

12:31.651 --> 12:33.620
in the bottom of a beer bottle.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.423
- Honey, you're upset.
- Blame him.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.958
He was a small town boy.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.659
He got un-stuck.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.064
He's showing people how
to bend over in a mall.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.133
Yeah well--

12:46.233 --> 12:48.768
The only thing he's got that
you ain't got is a gimmick.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.736
You'll get there.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.105
Roseanne, I haven't
even come close.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.173
Sure you have.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.475
What about your edible
nail polish thing?

12:55.575 --> 12:56.409
What's the matter with that?

12:59.046 --> 13:00.247
- Nothing.
- You'll do it.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.181
Trust me.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.916
You'll get there,
and when you do

13:03.016 --> 13:05.718
it's going to be a lot better
than having a stick on a rope.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.619
Yeah.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.355
Hey, you guys, I won!

13:08.455 --> 13:09.256
Won what?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.657
The blue-light prize.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.259
Oh, it was just incredible.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.761
The blue light went off went off
when I was in Towels Et Cetera.

13:14.862 --> 13:15.728
What'd you win?

13:15.829 --> 13:18.065
Oooh, check it
out, rubber sheets!

13:21.768 --> 13:24.437
Well, my mall day is done.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.738
You guys need a
ride to your car?

13:25.839 --> 13:28.575
No thanks, Dan
charted a helicopter.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.576
- OK, bye-bye!
- Bye.

13:29.676 --> 13:30.477
Bye.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.378
See ya Monday!

13:33.914 --> 13:36.349
Feel like a chili dog?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.919
Among other things.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.021
- You want a chili dog?
- No.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.323
I'm never eating again.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.458
Fine, but you are
still doing the dishes.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.366
Why isn't that
guy coming to us?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.767
He will, Son, he will.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.737
We've been waiting forever!

13:57.837 --> 13:58.972
We haven't been
waiting forever.

13:59.072 --> 14:03.243
We've only been
waiting half an hour.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.478
That's hardly forever.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.713
Hey, waiting is good for you.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.747
You know that?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.549
Waiting builds character.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.186
Waiting helps you appreciate
what you've been waiting for.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.023
You know, some of the greatest
men in history waited.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.690
Lincoln waited at Gettysburg.

14:17.790 --> 14:22.129
Caesar-- waited all the time.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.997
And these are some of
your great men of history.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.432
They were waiters?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.969
Uh-huh, yeah-- Excuse me!

14:29.069 --> 14:30.870
Dad, I need money.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.305
No she doesn't!

14:32.405 --> 14:34.607
Go suck on a loafer.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.076
Come on, Dad, Mom
won't give me any.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.945
Well, she probably
has a good reason.

14:38.045 --> 14:38.845
No.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.047
Just cheapness.

14:40.147 --> 14:40.948
All right, here.

14:41.048 --> 14:41.881
Thanks.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.084
And no parakeets.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.852
We still gonna wait?

14:45.953 --> 14:47.687
You bet.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.957
Is he ever gonna help us?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.558
Yeah, yeah, he's
gonna help us.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.630
Thomas Edison-- he waited.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.034
He's also deaf in one ear.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.802
Beethoven was totally deaf.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.306
He wrote some of the most
beautiful music ever written.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.542
My Aunt used to play
a piece by him--

15:09.642 --> 15:11.411
Moonlight Sonata.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.181
She only knew that
piece-- that and the theme

15:14.281 --> 15:17.517
from "A Summer Place."
Percy Sledge.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.523
Nah, that's Percy Faith.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.593
I get the Percys
mixed up all the time.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.428
Big Talent.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.796
Big, big, big.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.464
Reminds me-- hey,
excuse me, sir.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.865
Excuse me, I'll be
with you in a minute.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.805
Dad, my elbow is
five and a half.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.273
Great.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.274
Wanna see?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.742
No.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.244
Dad, will you measure my head?

15:44.344 --> 15:45.212
No.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.379
No, no, no, no,
no, just sit there.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.914
OK?
Just sit there.

15:48.015 --> 15:48.948
Don't measure anything.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.050
Don't touch anything.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.318
Don't try anything on.
Just sit there.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.120
Just sit.
Just sit there.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.387
OK?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.223
OK.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.457
All right, very quickly--

15:57.557 --> 15:58.491
I'm supposed to be on my
break-- so what do you want?

15:58.591 --> 15:59.392
Oh, yeah.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.893
Uh, uh, uh, this?
- What size?

16:00.994 --> 16:01.794
13D.

16:01.894 --> 16:02.695
13D.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.701
No sweat.

16:08.801 --> 16:15.708
Excuse me, but every
13D is different.

16:32.725 --> 16:36.163
Well, I guess that
answers my question.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.397
I was wondering if
you were sitting

16:37.497 --> 16:39.299
here thinking about what
to get me for Mother's Day.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.373
You're so not
talking to me, huh?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.340
Fine.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.211
There's plenty other
people who will.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.547
Hey, dudes, have you read
that new Pink Nipple album?

16:57.584 --> 16:58.518
Mother!

16:58.618 --> 16:59.652
It's a miracle!

16:59.752 --> 17:04.824
The mall has restored
your power of speech!

17:04.924 --> 17:05.925
So you were saying?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.528
Don't embarrass me
in front of strangers.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.199
Oh I didn't mean
to make you feel bad,

17:12.299 --> 17:14.601
and I'm sure you didn't mean to
make me feel bad when you threw

17:14.701 --> 17:16.936
that hissy fit in The Ultimate
and made me feel like the worst

17:17.036 --> 17:18.105
parent that ever lived.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.042
I'm sorry.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.612
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.480
You know I'd love
to buy you that dress,

17:27.580 --> 17:28.648
but we just can't afford it.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.450
I know.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.018
You want to go look
at something else?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.287
No, mother, I'll wear
what I already have.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.188
You sure?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.156
Yeah.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.790
I'll find something
in my closet.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.527
Ugh, Becky,
you're such a Saint.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.861
When we go home
you'll have to ride

17:41.961 --> 17:43.096
on the dashboard of the car.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.719
Ugh.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.155
What's wrong?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.256
I'm beat.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.590
Wonder why?

18:10.690 --> 18:14.527
Maybe cause you just snarfed
down 3,000 pounds of sugar.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.896
Shut up!

18:16.996 --> 18:18.698
I'm gonna go lay down.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.133
Lie down.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.869
Shut up.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.704
Mom, look what I got for you!

18:24.804 --> 18:26.072
A shoehorn!

18:26.173 --> 18:31.010
Why don't you go upstairs
and wrap it up and surprise me?

18:31.110 --> 18:31.911
OK.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.952
Well?

18:40.052 --> 18:41.020
Well, what?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.523
You know damn well well what.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.158
Is this the item
to which you are

18:45.258 --> 18:47.727
ever so obliquely referring?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.896
Yeah, let's see 'em.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.364
Oooh.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.333
Ahhh.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.334
Nice.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.835
Nice?

18:55.935 --> 18:59.572
Roseanne, every inch of
these babies is hand-sewn

18:59.672 --> 19:01.308
and that's not all.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.677
Notice the super-flex
sole, the bevel heel,

19:04.777 --> 19:07.547
the multi-textured
leathers and exotic skins.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.483
No, no, this is more
than a mere shoe.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.919
This is a timeless
piece of footwear.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.154
On behalf of shoes,
I'm Ed McMahon.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.962
Say, Ed, what did
you pay for them?

19:23.062 --> 19:29.636
79.95.

19:29.736 --> 19:36.909
Would you, uh, hate me if I
asked you to take them back?

19:37.009 --> 19:40.780
[laughing]

19:40.880 --> 19:42.549
Take them back?

19:42.649 --> 19:45.752
No, wait a minute, you've--
you've been on my case all week

19:45.852 --> 19:47.254
begging me to buy
a pair of shoes,

19:47.354 --> 19:48.788
and I finally give
in because I happen

19:48.888 --> 19:50.890
to be a decent human being.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.559
I drag you and your
back-from-the-dead

19:52.659 --> 19:53.893
sister to the mall.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.762
Drop you off at the
door while I drag

19:55.862 --> 19:58.531
my muffler around a parking lot
30 times looking for a place

19:58.631 --> 19:59.632
to park.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.434
Get kicked out of three
handicapped spaces,

20:01.534 --> 20:03.503
almost get arrested!

20:03.603 --> 20:05.872
Spent a day and a half in a shoe
store waitin' for Buster Brown

20:05.972 --> 20:08.775
with an attitude to
wait on me, and you

20:08.875 --> 20:09.776
want me to take these back?

20:09.876 --> 20:10.677
Yeah.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.479
May I ask why?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.347
Well, cause there was
this dress for Becky

20:14.447 --> 20:17.083
and it cost 80 bucks,
but I couldn't afford it.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.152
And so I just was thinkin'
that if we took the shoes back

20:20.253 --> 20:21.421
we could afford it.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.961
You're an amazing
woman, kiddo.

20:29.061 --> 20:34.367
I know, and it only took you
15 years to figure that out.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.368
Becky!

20:35.468 --> 20:37.236
Yeah?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.972
Daddy says we can
take back his shoes

20:40.072 --> 20:42.208
and we're going
to get that dress.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.410
Do you mean it?

20:43.510 --> 20:46.579
I swear on your
father's shoes.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.348
Buy you have to do
every single thing

20:48.448 --> 20:51.451
I tell you for the next
six months with no lip.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.752
I swear on my father's shoes.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.957
You gonna drive us, honey?

20:58.057 --> 21:00.059
