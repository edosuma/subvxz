<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:09.361 --> 00:10.360
This is it.

00:10.362 --> 00:12.162
Bunch of stuff came this week.

00:12.164 --> 00:13.863
Mom said pile it here.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.301
Joanie! Hey!!

00:23.909 --> 00:25.675
Can I talk to you?

00:25.677 --> 00:28.712
Six months. No explanation. No warning.

00:28.714 --> 00:31.080
I have a lot to explain, and I will.

00:31.082 --> 00:32.915
Or I'll try to. I just need to see Joanie.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.517
No. Absolutely not.

00:35.519 --> 00:38.087
I'm better now, and I'm back,

00:38.089 --> 00:40.122
and I'm not gonna leave her again.

00:42.226 --> 00:45.761
That's what you
got. One, two times a week.

00:45.763 --> 00:48.062
I've tried to be patient with you,

00:48.064 --> 00:50.364
and then you just fucking disappear.

00:50.366 --> 00:52.199
There's something deeply wrong with you.

00:52.201 --> 00:55.569
She's my daughter. You...
you can't keep her from me.

00:55.571 --> 00:57.371
- We can, actually.
- I wasn't well.

00:57.373 --> 00:58.706
You don't understand. I-I could...

00:58.708 --> 01:00.842
Nobody forced you to sign anything.

01:03.113 --> 01:06.379
Sweetheart.!

01:06.381 --> 01:08.448
- Thank you.
- I'm not doing this for you.

01:08.450 --> 01:10.083
I'm doing it for her.

<i>Daddy?</i>

03:39.358 --> 03:40.958
Daddy?

03:45.231 --> 03:46.964
Can I watch a show?

03:48.567 --> 03:51.635
Baby, it's a school day.

03:51.637 --> 03:53.437
But I want to.

03:53.439 --> 03:54.871
Come here.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.709
Come here. I need to look at you.

03:59.711 --> 04:01.477
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

04:02.781 --> 04:05.248
Let me look at you.

04:08.486 --> 04:10.753
It happened again.

04:10.755 --> 04:12.587
What happened?

04:12.589 --> 04:16.058
You got even more adorable.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.564
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.333
Come here.

04:24.335 --> 04:26.268
Please come here.

04:27.305 --> 04:29.270
Please come here.

04:29.272 --> 04:31.906
Come here. Yes.

04:31.908 --> 04:33.107
Yes.

04:33.109 --> 04:35.509
Okay, come on. Come on.

04:35.511 --> 04:38.012
Da-ding da-ding da-ding da-ding!

04:38.014 --> 04:40.181
Oy!

04:40.183 --> 04:43.251
I got to pick up the balloons,
buy a new camera battery,

04:43.253 --> 04:44.985
make the gift bags...

04:44.987 --> 04:46.786
I got the kids all personalized sunglasses

04:46.788 --> 04:48.455
with their names on the sides.

04:48.457 --> 04:51.524
Pink for the girls, green for the boys.

04:51.526 --> 04:54.694
Hey, um, did you confirm the entertainment?

04:54.696 --> 04:57.164
Already done.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.432
She's gonna love it.

04:59.434 --> 05:00.968
Who's picking her up from school?

05:00.970 --> 05:03.202
Um, I can. I mean, either way.

05:03.204 --> 05:05.771
She's seeing her mom
today after school, so...

05:05.773 --> 05:08.107
I have a meeting at 3:00,
but I could try and change it.

05:08.109 --> 05:10.009
No. It's okay. I can take her.

05:10.011 --> 05:11.143
You sure?

05:12.680 --> 05:16.648
Cole, I... I forgot I
need to pick up the cake.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.517
Mommy's making me a cake.

05:19.519 --> 05:20.986
Is that right?

05:25.458 --> 05:28.059
Did you know about that?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.794
How would I know about that?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.300
Can we cancel the one you ordered?

05:36.302 --> 05:37.968
No!

05:37.970 --> 05:40.504
We've already paid, and
it was really expensive.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.907
Well, we can eat the cost. That's fine.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.341
I can't believe she's coming.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.842
Well, we did invite her.

05:45.844 --> 05:48.012
I didn't think she'd show up.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.746
She's Joanie's mother.

05:49.748 --> 05:53.316
It's just so awkward.

05:53.318 --> 05:56.386
Joanie wants her there. It'll be fine.

05:56.388 --> 05:58.321
You have gone above and
beyond on this party,

05:58.323 --> 06:01.057
and Joanie is gonna have the best time.

06:01.059 --> 06:04.693
So just try to enjoy it, okay?

06:04.695 --> 06:05.861
Yeah.

06:12.069 --> 06:13.668
Come on. Mom did not say that.

06:13.670 --> 06:15.237
Yes, she did, man. I'm telling you.

06:15.239 --> 06:17.672
She's going crazy in her old age.

06:17.674 --> 06:19.107
I think she's just mad because you didn't

06:19.109 --> 06:20.875
name the baby after Scotty.

06:20.877 --> 06:23.011
- Mary Kate wasn't really...
- No, no, no. I get it.

06:23.013 --> 06:24.413
I get it. Bad voodoo, right?

06:24.415 --> 06:25.713
- Yeah.
- She's into all that stuff.

06:25.715 --> 06:27.081
Bro, she's into all that stuff.

06:28.584 --> 06:29.864
Bro, I think you're a gentleman.

06:36.025 --> 06:37.291
Keep working.

06:37.293 --> 06:39.293
Yes, captain.

06:39.295 --> 06:40.962
One... wait a minute.

06:49.737 --> 06:52.238
Ordered the ipe for the
deck. They said two weeks.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.539
Excellent. Thank you.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.241
Hey, I was looking in the southeast corner

06:55.243 --> 06:57.643
on the second floor... it's out of plumb.

06:57.645 --> 06:59.312
I'll take a look. But I
really wish you'd let me

06:59.314 --> 07:01.246
bring in some more experienced builders.

07:01.248 --> 07:03.582
Don't worry. I'm not letting
those guys do the tough stuff.

07:03.584 --> 07:04.883
But you should bring in some framers.

07:04.885 --> 07:06.118
I want to get the whole place re-measured.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.752
Got to get that roof on before winter.

07:07.754 --> 07:08.787
Yes, sir.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.526
Hey, honey. What's going on?

07:17.331 --> 07:19.830
Shit. Really?

07:19.832 --> 07:21.165
Call Caroline too?

07:23.903 --> 07:25.436
No, no. You stay there for the shift.

07:25.438 --> 07:27.472
I can pick her up.

07:27.474 --> 07:29.773
Yeah, it... Luisa, it's no problem.

07:29.775 --> 07:31.942
I can move the meeting.

07:31.944 --> 07:33.344
I'll do it.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.918
Hey, sweetie, come here!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.754
Ooh!

07:48.160 --> 07:50.293
Hey, sweetie.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.594
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

07:52.596 --> 07:56.499
Good. I thought Luisa was
dropping her off today.

07:56.501 --> 08:00.503
She got stuck at work.
We're short a hostess, so...

08:00.505 --> 08:02.671
Well, it's good to see you.

08:02.673 --> 08:04.473
It's good to see you too.

08:04.475 --> 08:07.209
Okay, do you want to go
to the playground today?

08:07.211 --> 08:09.344
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, let's go.

08:09.346 --> 08:11.612
Hello, Joanie.

08:11.614 --> 08:14.615
Mama, does she have to come?

08:14.617 --> 08:17.152
Yes, baby, she does.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.520
What about me?

08:18.522 --> 08:19.620
Can I come too?

08:19.622 --> 08:21.789
Yay! Daddy's coming!

08:21.791 --> 08:23.291
Is that all right?

08:23.293 --> 08:24.492
Yeah. Of course.

08:24.494 --> 08:26.160
Is that okay with you?

08:26.162 --> 08:28.228
If Joanie's happy, I'm happy, Mr. Lockhart.

08:28.230 --> 08:31.298
Great. All right, kiddo,
let's get you in the car.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.301
Actually, this is technically
Alison's visitation time,

08:34.303 --> 08:36.970
so I'd prefer she rode with Alison.

08:41.043 --> 08:42.876
Right. Yeah, of course.

08:42.878 --> 08:44.177
I'll see you there.

08:44.179 --> 08:46.212
Yeah.

08:46.214 --> 08:48.847
Okay. Should we race to the car?

08:58.659 --> 09:01.560
Okay, so, what should we do next?

09:01.562 --> 09:04.262
- Monkey bars.
- The monkey bars.

09:04.264 --> 09:05.997
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.699
Yeah, let's do the swing. No.

09:07.701 --> 09:09.934
Let's do the swing, Joanie.

09:11.738 --> 09:13.371
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go!

09:14.741 --> 09:16.208
Here.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.882
Hey.

09:30.289 --> 09:32.889
Okay, that's high enough now.

09:32.891 --> 09:35.325
- Mom, why?
- Joanie.

09:35.327 --> 09:37.494
Joanie.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.898
Joanie, come down now.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.267
Joanie.

09:44.269 --> 09:46.136
Don't.

09:46.138 --> 09:48.104
Joanie, Joanie, please. Here.

09:48.106 --> 09:49.939
Come here.

09:49.941 --> 09:51.306
Now.

09:51.308 --> 09:52.674
Don't do that, okay?

09:52.676 --> 09:53.975
Okay?

09:53.977 --> 09:56.278
That's too high. Look at me.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.546
Okay?

10:00.518 --> 10:02.284
Good girl.

10:02.286 --> 10:05.120
All right. Okay.

10:05.122 --> 10:06.622
- Where should we go now?
- Swings.

10:06.624 --> 10:09.123
Swings. Swings. Go, go, go, go!

10:09.125 --> 10:10.758
Swings.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.886
How was the rest of your day?

10:39.888 --> 10:42.288
It was good. Roof joints
are ready to go on.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.955
I'm gonna have Sal put
on a couple more guys,

10:43.957 --> 10:45.324
try to pick up the pace a little bit.

10:45.326 --> 10:47.826
That's good.

10:47.828 --> 10:50.496
How is Alison?

10:50.498 --> 10:52.731
They're good together.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.334
What does that mean?

10:55.336 --> 10:57.503
Nothing. I just haven't had
a whole lot of opportunity

10:57.505 --> 10:59.870
to see them together since she got back.

10:59.872 --> 11:01.573
What's good about it?

11:03.543 --> 11:05.577
They seem comfortable.

11:09.148 --> 11:11.849
When is the next court date?

11:11.851 --> 11:14.385
Why?

11:14.387 --> 11:16.220
No reason. Just asking.

11:16.222 --> 11:18.422
Two weeks.

11:18.424 --> 11:20.691
And that's the one to
grant unsupervised visits?

11:20.693 --> 11:23.327
No. We're not granting her anything.

11:23.329 --> 11:24.861
It's for the court to decide.

11:24.863 --> 11:27.831
I'm just saying Alison seems better.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.700
She seemed fine before,

11:29.702 --> 11:31.101
until she abandoned her daughter

11:31.103 --> 11:33.002
and checked herself into an institution.

11:33.004 --> 11:35.037
- I just don't trust her.
- Okay.

11:35.039 --> 11:37.340
I'm sorry. I don't think I ever will.

11:37.342 --> 11:38.774
I get it, Luisa.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.925
Nice shindig.

11:57.927 --> 11:59.361
Hey-hey!

11:59.363 --> 12:00.562
- Hey, man.
- Look at you?

12:00.564 --> 12:02.930
Ha! Wow.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.799
I don't want to wake him up.

12:04.801 --> 12:07.235
You won't. He sleeps through anything.

12:07.237 --> 12:09.970
Jenny burned toast the other
day, set the fire alarm off.

12:09.972 --> 12:11.305
Yeah, he didn't move.

12:13.409 --> 12:16.109
Yeah, he is pretty damn cute though?

12:16.111 --> 12:18.211
Where's Jenny?

12:18.213 --> 12:20.581
She's mingling. She's a mingler.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.215
I thought you were the mingler.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.584
We take turns.

12:23.586 --> 12:25.084
- How's the house coming?
- Good.

12:25.086 --> 12:25.951
- Yeah?
- Good. We should be in

12:25.953 --> 12:26.986
by April.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.388
Unreal.

12:28.390 --> 12:29.389
What's that?

12:29.391 --> 12:32.091
You! You're all grown up.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.926
All settled.

12:33.928 --> 12:35.428
Luisa's been good for you, man.

12:35.430 --> 12:39.098
I don't think I've ever
seen you this happy.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.401
I'm a lucky man.

12:47.408 --> 12:48.507
Hey, Mary Kate?

12:48.509 --> 12:49.741
Will you do me a favor?

12:49.743 --> 12:51.009
- Yeah.
- Take some pictures?

12:51.011 --> 12:52.243
- Sure.
- Thank you.

12:59.686 --> 13:01.485
Mommy!

13:01.487 --> 13:03.354
Hi, sweetie!

13:03.356 --> 13:05.656
Hey!

13:05.658 --> 13:07.625
Hey.

13:07.627 --> 13:10.328
- Hey.
- Welcome.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.330
Wow, you guys went all out.

13:12.332 --> 13:13.764
A pony.

13:13.766 --> 13:16.098
I love ponies.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.768
That's 'cause you come
from a family of ranchers.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.770
On one side, anyway.

13:23.342 --> 13:24.541
Let me take that.

13:24.543 --> 13:26.108
Thank you.

13:29.781 --> 13:32.681
Joanie, you want to show
your mom all your presents?

13:32.683 --> 13:34.049
Okay.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.125
It was a misunderstanding.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.761
No, no, it's fine.

14:11.253 --> 14:13.152
Cole. Get a picture.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.156
Yahoo!

14:17.158 --> 14:18.358
Keep going, girl.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.594
Yay!

14:20.596 --> 14:23.363
- Whoo!
- Yes!

14:45.184 --> 14:47.886
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.053
Good girl.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.628
Hey.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.395
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.730
No. Wait. Joanie!

14:59.732 --> 15:02.766
- Wait, wait.
- Joanie! Hey.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.868
- What are you doing?
- Let her do it.

15:25.723 --> 15:27.990
That's it.

15:27.992 --> 15:29.058
Come here.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.393
Hey, kiddo. You okay?

15:31.395 --> 15:32.961
Yeah, she's fine.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.564
- Any broken bones?
- We don't think so.

15:35.566 --> 15:38.467
Good. You ready to get back on the horse?

15:38.469 --> 15:40.068
Yes, you are.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.837
That's what we do when we fall off horses.

15:41.839 --> 15:43.137
We get right back on.

15:43.139 --> 15:44.405
Right, Mom?

15:46.910 --> 15:49.743
That's right.

15:49.745 --> 15:51.812
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

15:51.814 --> 15:54.281
You're a tough girl. You're gonna be fine.

15:54.283 --> 15:56.049
I'll go with you this time, okay?

16:19.140 --> 16:20.573
Luisa?

16:29.550 --> 16:31.483
You want to talk about what just happened?

16:35.355 --> 16:37.222
Where you going with that?

16:43.997 --> 16:45.630
<i>Great party.</i>

16:45.632 --> 16:47.064
<i>- Thank you.
- Good seeing you.</i>

16:47.066 --> 16:48.533
Yeah, good to see you.

16:48.535 --> 16:49.834
- Hope you had fun.
- I didn't. He loved it.

16:49.836 --> 16:50.968
Bye.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.036
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

16:52.038 --> 16:53.337
The four of us? Dinner? Soon?

16:53.339 --> 16:54.471
Absolutely. I'll set it up.

16:54.473 --> 16:55.640
- All right, yup.
- Bye.

16:55.642 --> 16:57.641
- Safe drive.
- Okay. Bye.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.020
Look, I'm sorry. I just reacted.

17:11.256 --> 17:14.823
I mean, the whole thing happened so fast.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.191
Could you stop cleaning for a second

17:16.193 --> 17:17.259
and just talk to me?

17:17.261 --> 17:20.162
What do you want me to say?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.597
I can't stand feeling like this.

17:21.598 --> 17:22.830
- Like?
- Like I've done

17:22.833 --> 17:24.433
everything I can,

17:24.435 --> 17:26.769
everything that's been
asked of me, and still...

17:26.771 --> 17:27.936
And still what?

17:27.939 --> 17:30.072
This town is not my home.

17:30.074 --> 17:32.273
Joanie is not my child, but I've tried.

17:32.275 --> 17:34.075
I love that little girl.

17:34.077 --> 17:36.343
Now Alison gets to show up
again after running away,

17:36.345 --> 17:38.546
and just takes everything
back, including you.

17:38.548 --> 17:39.847
That's not what she's doing.

17:39.849 --> 17:41.783
That's what she's trying to do!

17:41.785 --> 17:44.218
You can't see it because
you're so blind to her.

17:44.220 --> 17:47.021
You see her as this fragile
thing. It's such bullshit.

17:47.023 --> 17:51.692
I know this whole situation
has been incredibly challenging,

17:51.694 --> 17:54.194
and you have been amazing.

17:54.196 --> 17:56.597
But I'm yours, okay?

17:56.599 --> 18:00.133
Look, we're building a
home together, a life.

18:00.135 --> 18:02.402
And I'm just trying to
do right by everybody.

18:02.404 --> 18:04.104
By you, by Joanie, and, yes, by her.

18:04.106 --> 18:05.471
I mean, I know she's made some mistakes...

18:05.473 --> 18:07.306
Some mistakes?

18:07.308 --> 18:10.275
Cole, she abandoned her
daughter on our doorstep.

18:10.277 --> 18:12.979
- She is still Joanie's mother.
- She doesn't deserve to be!

18:12.981 --> 18:14.379
Well, what do you want me to do?

18:14.381 --> 18:15.948
You want me to have her locked up?

18:15.950 --> 18:18.050
For depression? For being afraid?

18:18.052 --> 18:20.653
We lost our child!

18:28.161 --> 18:31.896
I know.

18:31.898 --> 18:34.699
How am I ever gonna compete with that?

18:38.304 --> 18:40.671
It is not a competition.

18:40.673 --> 18:42.472
Of course it is.

18:42.474 --> 18:45.509
It's not.

18:45.511 --> 18:47.611
You are my wife.

18:51.283 --> 18:54.118
I don't even know why we're
having this conversation.

19:05.797 --> 19:08.330
- Cole Lockhart?
- Yeah?

19:08.332 --> 19:11.200
I'm Detective Stanton of the
Livingston, New Jersey, Police.

19:11.202 --> 19:13.135
This is my partner, Detective Romero,

19:13.137 --> 19:15.637
and Officer Gibbons of East Hampton.

19:15.639 --> 19:17.338
Hey, Mr. Lockhart.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.940
So, what's this about?

19:18.942 --> 19:22.210
Have you heard the
news about Noah Solloway?

19:22.212 --> 19:25.013
He was attacked.

19:25.015 --> 19:26.114
Attacked?

19:26.116 --> 19:28.016
Stabbed.

19:28.018 --> 19:30.384
Look, would you mind
telling us where you were

19:30.386 --> 19:31.451
last Wednesday night?

19:31.453 --> 19:32.519
Get the fuck out of here.

19:32.521 --> 19:34.354
It's just a question.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.691
I didn't even know that piece
of shit was out of prison.

19:36.693 --> 19:39.060
Mr. Lockhart, we're just
kicking all the tires here.

19:39.062 --> 19:41.361
Between your ex-wife and your brother,

19:41.363 --> 19:43.664
this is one alibi we need to have.

19:45.201 --> 19:47.834
He was home with me.

19:47.836 --> 19:50.670
Good evening, ma'am. And you are?

19:50.672 --> 19:52.138
I'm his wife.

19:54.009 --> 19:56.076
Okay.

19:56.078 --> 19:57.543
Well, I guess
that's all we needed to know.

19:57.545 --> 19:59.879
Thank you, folks.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.247
Have a nice night.

20:03.251 --> 20:05.250
Hey.

20:05.252 --> 20:07.753
Is he alive?

20:07.755 --> 20:09.521
He is.

20:11.892 --> 20:15.060
Too bad.

20:24.237 --> 20:26.670
Where were you really?

21:03.207 --> 21:05.374
- Hey.
- You could've warned me.

21:05.376 --> 21:08.410
- About what?
- The cops, Alison.

21:08.412 --> 21:10.813
The ones asking me if I
tried to murder your husband.

21:10.815 --> 21:12.446
They came here too. I'm... I-I'm sorry.

21:12.448 --> 21:14.048
I-I didn't know they would go to you.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.350
Well, they did. They
were looking for an alibi.

21:18.321 --> 21:19.888
Do you have one?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.992
I was fucking home on Wednesday.

21:23.994 --> 21:26.761
Okay. Sorry.

21:26.763 --> 21:30.230
When were you gonna tell
me he's out of prison?

21:30.232 --> 21:32.232
I...

21:32.234 --> 21:34.434
I, I didn't think
you'd be interested and...

21:34.436 --> 21:36.503
Really? You didn't think I'd be interested

21:36.505 --> 21:39.239
that the man who killed my brother is free

21:39.241 --> 21:40.640
to start his new life

21:40.642 --> 21:42.810
wherever he wants, whenever he wants?

21:42.812 --> 21:44.077
He's a fucking free man,

21:44.079 --> 21:46.145
and we're stuck here in this shit!

21:46.147 --> 21:48.247
You tell him that if he
ever so much as sets foot

21:48.249 --> 21:50.082
in this town again, I
will fucking murder him,

21:50.084 --> 21:51.317
and I'll do it in broad daylight,

21:51.319 --> 21:52.785
and I'll invite the cops to watch.

21:52.787 --> 21:55.922
Okay, I'm not in touch
with him anymore, okay?

21:55.924 --> 21:58.291
- Look, do you want to sit?
- No. I'm not staying.

21:58.293 --> 21:59.725
Okay.

22:01.762 --> 22:03.528
Look, I'm sorry about this.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.630
The cops, they're just doing their job...

22:05.632 --> 22:07.432
I don't give a fuck about Noah Solloway!

22:07.434 --> 22:09.868
It's this shit! This
drama that comes with you.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.436
I don't need it in my life!

22:11.438 --> 22:13.939
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.640
- Okay.
- My life is good

22:15.642 --> 22:17.843
when you're not around.

22:17.845 --> 22:20.110
Business is booming. My
family's doing better.

22:20.112 --> 22:21.212
Luisa and I are solid.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.479
And then you show up,

22:22.481 --> 22:24.448
and you see me settled,

22:24.450 --> 22:26.550
and you just think to yourself,
"Nope, that shit can't stand.

22:26.552 --> 22:27.985
I got to fuck that right up."

22:27.987 --> 22:29.686
No. That's not what I'm trying to do.

22:29.688 --> 22:31.188
- Aren't you?
- No.

22:31.190 --> 22:35.025
Jesus, Cole. God, you...
you have everything.

22:35.027 --> 22:36.026
Okay? I'm sitting...

22:36.028 --> 22:37.626
You created this situation!

22:37.628 --> 22:39.462
You left your child in
the middle of the night!

22:39.464 --> 22:41.164
- I know.
- So don't you fucking complain

22:41.166 --> 22:43.366
to me about the consequences
of abandoning your baby!

22:43.368 --> 22:44.868
No, I did not abandon her!

22:44.870 --> 22:48.371
I left her with her fucking father!

22:48.373 --> 22:52.708
You can't possibly imagine
how much I hate myself

22:52.710 --> 22:54.843
for what I did.

22:54.845 --> 22:57.479
And that's why I'm doing
exactly what you and the court

22:57.481 --> 22:59.047
and everybody tells me to,

22:59.049 --> 23:03.085
because I know that I
deserve to be punished.

23:03.087 --> 23:05.387
We are not trying to punish you.

23:05.389 --> 23:08.156
We're trying to protect Joanie's safety.

23:08.158 --> 23:12.193
Yeah, I know, and that's why
I'm trying so hard to prove...

23:12.195 --> 23:14.061
God, I...

23:14.063 --> 23:17.731
I see my own daughter once a week

23:17.733 --> 23:22.336
with a stranger watching me bathe her,

23:22.338 --> 23:24.105
feed her.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.474
It's awful.

23:30.913 --> 23:32.678
But I'm doing it, and I'm not complaining,

23:32.680 --> 23:36.116
so please just, like,
cut me a little slack.

23:44.526 --> 23:46.758
Cole?

23:49.463 --> 23:51.730
Thank you for what you did today.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.569
I'll try and leave you alone, okay?

23:57.571 --> 24:01.006
I-I don't want to make
anything more difficult for you.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.970
<i>- One, two...
- I got some more leaves.</i>

24:32.972 --> 24:34.537
_ - More? Okay. Ready? Three!

24:34.539 --> 24:37.206
Whoo!

24:37.208 --> 24:39.608
Okay. Ready?

24:39.610 --> 24:41.610
Okay.

24:47.518 --> 24:48.884
Yay!

24:48.886 --> 24:51.687
Good girl! Yeah!

24:53.056 --> 24:55.357
- Now you.
- Now me?

24:55.359 --> 24:57.158
Ooh, okay.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.127
Ready? Gonna take my shoes off.

24:59.129 --> 25:00.996
Okay.

25:06.903 --> 25:08.569
Aww.

25:08.571 --> 25:10.471
You gorgeous girl.

25:10.473 --> 25:12.239
Now, what do you want to do now?

25:12.241 --> 25:13.474
Monkey bars.

25:13.476 --> 25:16.510
Monkey bars. Okay.

25:20.249 --> 25:23.017
Monkey bars. Yeah, let's go.

25:45.539 --> 25:49.074
Okay, you know what? That's a little high.

25:49.076 --> 25:51.176
I'm fine.

25:51.178 --> 25:53.512
Okay.

25:53.514 --> 25:54.514
You all right?

25:57.217 --> 25:59.351
Okay.

25:59.353 --> 26:02.019
That's en... Joanie.

26:02.021 --> 26:03.720
Okay.

26:06.725 --> 26:08.725
Hey, Joanie.

26:08.727 --> 26:10.761
Joanie.

26:10.763 --> 26:12.263
Wait.

26:12.265 --> 26:14.598
Joanie.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.966
Okay, that's enough now, Joanie.

26:15.968 --> 26:17.068
Joanie. Jo...

26:17.070 --> 26:18.834
Wait. Watch.

26:20.238 --> 26:22.805
Here. Okay. Good girl.

26:22.807 --> 26:24.974
That's it. That's it.

26:24.976 --> 26:27.310
Okay, that's it. Right, good girl.

26:27.312 --> 26:29.779
No.

26:29.781 --> 26:31.047
Okay.

26:31.049 --> 26:34.650
Hey. Look, you did it!

26:34.652 --> 26:36.552
You did it!

26:36.554 --> 26:39.555
My brave girl. Hey.

26:42.926 --> 26:44.726
My brave girl.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.161
Yeah.

26:53.503 --> 26:57.071
All right, so,
what shall we do now?

26:57.073 --> 27:00.174
- Swings.
- Swings.

27:00.176 --> 27:02.009
God, you're so big now.

27:03.746 --> 27:06.747
Look at you..

27:06.749 --> 27:08.749
Do you remember when I was born?

27:11.153 --> 27:13.853
Yeah. Of course I do.

27:13.855 --> 27:17.957
Was it a day or a night?

27:17.959 --> 27:20.793
Um, it was a night.

27:22.598 --> 27:25.465
It was a rainy night. It was a big storm.

27:25.467 --> 27:28.601
The wind was so strong,

27:28.603 --> 27:30.802
I thought the windows might blow out.

27:30.804 --> 27:32.804
Was Daddy there?

27:34.875 --> 27:37.409
Yeah, Daddy was there.

27:38.946 --> 27:40.812
He was feeding me ice chips.

27:40.814 --> 27:42.881
You know, that's really all
daddies can do in that moment.

27:42.883 --> 27:44.849
We got to get going.

27:44.851 --> 27:46.751
Come on, kiddo.

27:47.820 --> 27:49.387
Right.

27:49.389 --> 27:52.857
Get up.

27:52.859 --> 27:54.792
- Got the water?
- Okay, let's go.

27:58.465 --> 28:01.198
All right. Good girl.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.634
- Okay, bye, Peppa Pig.
- Bye, Mummy Pig.

28:03.636 --> 28:06.703
Okay, I'll see you in, ooh,

28:06.705 --> 28:09.206
20 hours and ten minutes.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.807
That's when your party is.

28:10.809 --> 28:12.576
Exciting! Exciting!

28:12.578 --> 28:14.010
Muah. Love you.

28:14.012 --> 28:15.479
- Bye!
- Bye!

28:15.481 --> 28:18.481
- Buckle up.
- So, Marlena left?

28:18.483 --> 28:20.483
Yeah. She had another appointment.

28:22.487 --> 28:25.154
Well, how did I do today?

28:25.156 --> 28:26.556
What do you mean?

28:26.558 --> 28:28.658
Well, did she say anything to you about,

28:28.660 --> 28:29.992
you know, my behavior?

28:29.994 --> 28:31.427
I saw you two talking, so...

28:31.429 --> 28:34.329
We were talking about her kids.

28:34.331 --> 28:36.898
We don't talk about you.
That would be unethical.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.333
No. Right. I just, you know, thought

28:38.335 --> 28:40.735
maybe she said something about...

28:40.737 --> 28:42.571
She didn't.

28:42.573 --> 28:43.938
Right. Okay.

28:45.742 --> 28:47.609
Well, I-I think it went great.

28:50.347 --> 28:53.847
By the way, I want
to bake a cake for the party.

28:53.849 --> 28:55.382
- A cake?
- Yeah.

28:55.384 --> 28:56.950
Like a birthday cake.

28:56.952 --> 29:00.221
Is that a problem?

29:00.223 --> 29:04.358
No. No, but we're a... a no-nut household.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.026
Luisa's got an allergy.

29:06.028 --> 29:09.061
Okay. Got it.

29:09.063 --> 29:11.564
No nuts.

29:11.566 --> 29:13.799
One more thing, Cole.

29:13.801 --> 29:17.069
Um, can Joanie spend the night on Tuesday?

29:17.071 --> 29:18.904
You know, for her actual birthday?

29:18.906 --> 29:21.974
- Alone?
- Yeah.

29:21.976 --> 29:23.543
That's an unsupervised visit.

29:23.545 --> 29:25.577
No, I know.

29:25.579 --> 29:27.812
But I-I think I've earned it, don't you?

29:27.814 --> 29:29.281
That's not up to me.
That's up to the court.

29:29.283 --> 29:30.882
No, I know. But if you say it's okay,

29:30.884 --> 29:32.917
then the court's not gonna stop you, right?

29:32.919 --> 29:35.554
I mean...

29:35.556 --> 29:37.289
Never mind. I'm sorry.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.624
I-I shouldn't have asked.

29:38.626 --> 29:39.658
It's fine.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.560
I'll talk to Luisa.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.160
But I'm not promising anything.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.599
Ooh, bye, baby!

29:48.601 --> 29:50.234
Love you, sweetie.

29:55.775 --> 29:58.509
Bye!

30:32.176 --> 30:33.708
Shit. Okay.

30:46.489 --> 30:49.390
Um, well, I've been
swimming and doing yoga.

30:49.392 --> 30:53.694
Just keeping healthy and
trying to stay focused.

30:53.696 --> 30:57.897
And of course spending as
much time with Joanie as I can.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.166
You know, we've gotten some
real quality time together,

31:00.168 --> 31:02.836
and it's getting better and better.

31:02.838 --> 31:04.237
The bond is there,

31:04.239 --> 31:08.507
and, um, my-my confidence
has never been higher.

31:08.509 --> 31:10.309
Okay.

31:10.311 --> 31:12.211
Well-well, I suppose I
just want to make sure

31:12.213 --> 31:13.512
I'm doing everything I can

31:13.514 --> 31:17.383
so that this next hearing goes my way.

31:17.385 --> 31:22.054
You know, unsupervised visits
are technically the next step,

31:22.056 --> 31:26.324
and, um, I'm ready for it.

31:26.326 --> 31:28.360
And I really want this to happen.

31:28.362 --> 31:31.062
So anything you can do to help would...

31:31.064 --> 31:33.164
You know it's not up to me.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.833
Yeah, I understand.

31:34.835 --> 31:38.035
I just... but, you know, we
both know that your opinion

31:38.037 --> 31:39.337
will mean a lot to the judge.

31:39.339 --> 31:41.172
Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.

31:41.174 --> 31:44.541
If you really want my opinion,
there are issues outstanding.

31:44.543 --> 31:46.577
I've said this to you.

31:46.579 --> 31:50.714
The forensic report is... not flattering.

31:50.716 --> 31:53.851
Your issues with depression
and your breakdown are described

31:53.853 --> 31:55.051
in some detail.

31:55.053 --> 31:56.754
Yeah, well, they're in the past.

31:56.756 --> 31:59.389
Still, the court-appointed psychologist

31:59.391 --> 32:00.456
questions how reliable...

32:00.458 --> 32:02.358
The report is old.

32:03.795 --> 32:06.262
I've proven myself consistently.

32:06.264 --> 32:08.698
I also really need to consider
whether my client is ready

32:08.700 --> 32:10.600
for unsupervised visits.

32:10.602 --> 32:12.368
The current situation has been

32:12.370 --> 32:16.104
and remains stressful for my client.

32:16.106 --> 32:19.040
You mean my
five-year-old daughter?

32:19.042 --> 32:21.710
I'm sorry. I just find it a little strange

32:21.712 --> 32:23.311
when you refer to her as your client.

32:23.313 --> 32:25.414
Well, whether you like it or not,

32:25.416 --> 32:28.316
I was appointed by the
court to advocate for her.

32:28.318 --> 32:29.885
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

32:29.887 --> 32:31.152
Please, continue.

32:31.154 --> 32:34.488
Have you found a job, Ms. Bailey?

32:34.490 --> 32:36.490
Well, I'm still the
owner of The Lobster Roll,

32:36.492 --> 32:39.660
so that brings me a healthy income.

32:39.662 --> 32:41.829
A-and... and recently
I've been thinking

32:41.831 --> 32:44.064
of trying to reinstate my nursing license.

32:44.066 --> 32:46.500
So, no job.

32:46.502 --> 32:49.669
And, um, your marriage to the ex-convict

32:49.671 --> 32:51.137
who killed your brother-in-law?

32:51.139 --> 32:53.773
How's that going?

32:53.775 --> 32:55.508
I told you.

32:55.510 --> 32:56.843
We're estranged.

32:56.845 --> 32:58.845
But not divorced.

32:58.847 --> 33:00.447
No.

33:00.449 --> 33:02.482
I've got to be honest with you, Ms. Bailey.

33:02.484 --> 33:04.884
The problem isn't me.

33:13.994 --> 33:16.094
Fuck!

33:33.212 --> 33:34.812
All right.

34:25.495 --> 34:28.062
Ms. Bailey, I'm Detective Stanton.

34:28.063 --> 34:30.598
This is my partner, Detective Romero.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.600
Livingston, New Jersey.
You mind if we have a word?

34:33.601 --> 34:35.235
What is this about?

34:35.237 --> 34:36.837
My daughter?

34:36.839 --> 34:38.237
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.672
It's nothing like that at all.

34:39.675 --> 34:40.940
Sorry. We didn't mean to alarm you.

34:40.943 --> 34:43.610
No. This is about your estranged husband.

34:43.612 --> 34:46.713
Have you heard from him lately?

34:46.715 --> 34:48.114
No.

34:49.717 --> 34:51.216
Well, you should know.

34:51.217 --> 34:53.719
Mr. Solloway was stabbed
in the neck Wednesday night.

34:54.856 --> 34:56.856
What?

34:56.858 --> 34:58.858
What? It... well, is he okay?

34:58.860 --> 35:01.761
Yeah, yeah, he's
okay. He's gonna be fine.

35:01.763 --> 35:03.796
- Well, where?
- In New Jersey

35:03.798 --> 35:06.164
at the college campus where he teaches.

35:08.101 --> 35:09.734
- Ms...
- My God, I-I...

35:09.736 --> 35:12.037
Ms. Bailey, have you spoken
to Mr. Solloway at all

35:12.039 --> 35:13.538
since his release from prison?

35:13.540 --> 35:15.774
No. We-we haven't spoken in almost a year.

35:15.776 --> 35:18.643
I... well, do... do you know who did this?

35:18.645 --> 35:19.878
We got a couple of leads.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.546
You know, we're talking to people

35:21.548 --> 35:23.914
we think might've had a beef
or two with Mr. Solloway.

35:23.916 --> 35:27.217
Yeah, and speaking of which,
would you have any idea

35:27.219 --> 35:30.721
where your ex-husband
was on Wednesday night?

35:30.723 --> 35:32.289
Cole?

35:32.291 --> 35:33.657
He wasn't with you, was he?

35:33.659 --> 35:36.293
No. Why... why would he be with me? I...

35:36.295 --> 35:40.262
No reason. No, we're-we're
just looking for an alibi.

35:40.264 --> 35:41.731
You know what? We'll...

35:41.733 --> 35:43.399
we'll just go talk to him.

35:43.401 --> 35:45.068
Yeah, that's a good idea, you know?

35:45.070 --> 35:46.970
We-we don't need to waste
any more of your time.

35:46.972 --> 35:50.406
Here. If, um... if anything comes to you.

35:50.408 --> 35:51.674
Thank you.

35:53.478 --> 35:56.445
Wait, detectives. I-I,

35:56.447 --> 35:59.815
I really don't want any part of this.

35:59.817 --> 36:03.785
I-I'm in a custody
situation, and I-I...

36:03.787 --> 36:05.787
I really don't need the trouble.

36:05.789 --> 36:09.224
We understand. We're sorry to bother you.

36:10.661 --> 36:12.794
What are you making?

36:12.796 --> 36:14.996
Um, frosting. You know, for a cake.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.464
My daughter's birthday.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.566
- Nice.
- Night.

36:47.462 --> 36:49.227
<i>Hey. It's me. Um...</i>

36:51.799 --> 36:54.332
<i>I know you told me not
to contact you, but...</i>

36:57.471 --> 37:02.474
<i>but I, um, I just needed
to hear your voice, so...</i>

37:07.480 --> 37:10.848
<i>And now I have, so, so...</i>

37:10.850 --> 37:13.151
No.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.511
<i>Hey, it's Noah
Solloway. Please leave...</i>

37:50.755 --> 37:52.054
Shit.

38:58.351 --> 39:01.019
I think yours looks better.

39:02.389 --> 39:03.888
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:03.890 --> 39:05.355
Where's little O?

39:05.357 --> 39:07.324
Jenny's feeding him inside.

39:07.326 --> 39:09.894
Kid can't eat in loud places.

39:09.896 --> 39:12.462
Can you imagine? Me with
an oversensitive son?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.465
No.

39:15.467 --> 39:17.067
Hey. Let's get a beer.

39:25.243 --> 39:27.277
Bailey, come on. Let's get a beer.

39:30.148 --> 39:33.082
No, no, I probably shouldn't.

39:33.084 --> 39:35.584
- Wow.
- Yeah.

39:35.586 --> 39:38.386
You get your cavities
filled without Novocaine too?

39:38.388 --> 39:41.023
I'm fine, Oscar.

39:41.025 --> 39:44.026
Then why am I so nervous?

39:44.028 --> 39:46.394
Hey, let me ask you.

39:46.396 --> 39:49.431
Are town council meetings
still on Wednesday nights?

39:49.433 --> 39:52.067
They are.

39:52.069 --> 39:53.335
Why? You thinking about running?

39:53.337 --> 39:55.203
You can have my spot.

39:55.205 --> 39:56.670
So over this town.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.442
Was Cole there last week?

40:01.444 --> 40:03.610
Um...

40:03.612 --> 40:05.246
actually, no, I don't think he was.

40:05.248 --> 40:07.548
- Why?
- No-no reason.

40:07.550 --> 40:09.116
I was just, you know, wondering.

40:10.286 --> 40:12.785
Wondering about what?

40:12.787 --> 40:17.290
Alison here is thinking of
running for town council.

40:17.292 --> 40:18.391
Really?

40:18.393 --> 40:20.560
Yeah. Maybe. One day.

40:22.397 --> 40:25.198
So, how you doing?

40:25.200 --> 40:27.767
I'm fine.

40:27.769 --> 40:29.634
All right, well, I'm
gonna go check on Jenny,

40:29.636 --> 40:31.937
make sure the kid's not
sucking her boobs off.

40:31.939 --> 40:33.772
I swear he's stealing

40:33.774 --> 40:35.540
everything from me.

40:39.213 --> 40:42.214
Wow. You guys really
went all out. It's great.

40:42.216 --> 40:44.583
Well, it is her fifth birthday, so...

40:44.585 --> 40:47.418
Well, did you buy her a horse?

40:47.420 --> 40:48.819
No.

40:48.821 --> 40:53.124
No. That's a rental. You know, pony rental.

40:53.126 --> 40:54.993
That's not a pony, Cole.

40:54.995 --> 40:56.094
That's a horse.

40:56.096 --> 40:58.562
Her name is Sparkles.

40:58.564 --> 40:59.730
Don't worry.

40:59.732 --> 41:01.366
I'm not worried.

41:12.912 --> 41:15.812
Ready? Cheese!

41:25.290 --> 41:27.189
Who wants to ride the pony?

41:27.191 --> 41:28.824
Me!

41:28.826 --> 41:31.193
Pony!

41:48.445 --> 41:50.946
It's your birthday, so you get to go first.

41:50.948 --> 41:52.213
I don't want to ride the pony.

41:52.215 --> 41:53.815
I want more cake.

41:53.817 --> 41:55.049
Okay, you can
have another piece of cake

41:55.051 --> 41:56.350
after you ride the pony.

41:56.352 --> 41:57.851
I don't want to.

41:57.853 --> 41:59.820
Look, I can take her for cake.

41:59.822 --> 42:02.189
- It's okay.
- It's fine. I can.

42:02.191 --> 42:05.559
Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.

42:05.561 --> 42:07.861
Look, she doesn't want to ride.

42:07.863 --> 42:09.729
Of course she does. She asked for this.

42:09.731 --> 42:10.897
Yeah, and now she's scared,

42:10.899 --> 42:12.465
so let her watch some kids go first.

42:12.467 --> 42:14.400
- Alison, don't make a scene.
- I'm...

42:14.402 --> 42:16.402
I'm not. She doesn't want to go, Cole.

42:16.404 --> 42:18.504
No. You don't want her to
go. She sees you scared.

42:18.506 --> 42:21.040
It's making it worse.

42:21.042 --> 42:24.677
It is your birthday,
and you are a big girl now.

42:24.679 --> 42:26.212
You're gonna be fine, okay?

42:26.214 --> 42:27.580
Up you go.

42:29.749 --> 42:31.149
Hands on the horn.

42:31.151 --> 42:33.585
Got her?

42:33.587 --> 42:36.888
There you go. All right.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.029
Call 911!

43:29.873 --> 43:31.806
Alison, stop, stop.

43:31.808 --> 43:33.442
Hey, she's okay. She's okay.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.943
She's okay. Look.

43:34.945 --> 43:38.046
Look. Look.

43:38.048 --> 43:41.049
- She's fine.
- Was it scary? No?

43:43.386 --> 43:46.087
- She's okay.
- It wasn't really scary.

43:46.089 --> 43:47.821
You're fine. Look at you.

43:57.599 --> 43:59.199
I'm sorry.

44:01.937 --> 44:03.870
It happens to me too.

44:15.683 --> 44:18.650
Joanie?

44:18.652 --> 44:21.253
- Mama!
- Hey, sweetie. Come here.

44:24.192 --> 44:27.325
- Are you okay?
- I fell.

44:27.327 --> 44:30.095
I know you did. I know you did.

44:30.097 --> 44:32.297
I love you.

44:32.299 --> 44:34.132
Hey.

44:34.134 --> 44:36.534
Come here.

44:44.310 --> 44:46.443
Hey, Alison.

44:46.445 --> 44:48.445
I wanted to give this back to you.

44:48.447 --> 44:50.547
No, that's okay. You can keep it.

44:50.549 --> 44:53.383
No, we'll never eat it.

44:53.385 --> 44:56.520
Well, I-I made it for Joanie.

44:56.522 --> 44:59.556
Yeah. That was very sweet of you.

45:07.732 --> 45:11.134
Do you have any idea how
hard I worked on this party?

45:11.136 --> 45:13.569
Luisa,

45:13.571 --> 45:15.138
what exactly is the problem?

45:15.140 --> 45:17.072
Well, the problem is you seem incapable

45:17.074 --> 45:19.508
of putting that child's
needs before your own.

45:19.510 --> 45:23.077
Why? Because I suggested that
horse was too big for her?

45:23.079 --> 45:24.246
It was.

45:24.248 --> 45:26.714
No. You don't get it, do you?

45:26.716 --> 45:28.350
You make her uncomfortable.

45:28.352 --> 45:31.553
She picks up on your
anxiety and your unhappiness,

45:31.555 --> 45:33.821
and she gets nervous that
you're gonna leave her again.

45:33.823 --> 45:35.422
That's why she fell off the horse.

45:35.424 --> 45:37.090
She had to look for you,

45:37.092 --> 45:38.892
because as soon as you're
out of her sight line,

45:38.894 --> 45:41.228
she's afraid you'll fucking disappear.

45:41.230 --> 45:43.564
You can't do that to children, Alison.

45:43.566 --> 45:44.931
You can't just come and go as you like.

45:44.933 --> 45:47.100
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- For God sakes,

45:47.102 --> 45:49.836
Cole says your mother left you as a child.

45:49.838 --> 45:51.038
How could you do the same thing to her?

45:51.040 --> 45:52.539
Please, just leave me alone.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.940
No! I'm sorry, but somebody has to say...

45:54.942 --> 45:58.077
Just stop, will you, please?

45:58.079 --> 46:01.013
Don't be a monster.

46:01.015 --> 46:03.115
She is my daughter, okay?

46:03.117 --> 46:07.220
I know I fucked up, and I've
apologized a thousand times.

46:07.222 --> 46:09.088
And I am so grateful to you

46:09.090 --> 46:10.855
for everything you did while I was gone,

46:10.857 --> 46:14.726
but she is my child.

46:14.728 --> 46:16.428
And she needs me.

46:16.430 --> 46:17.729
And you can everything, okay?

46:17.731 --> 46:19.264
You can have the restaurant,

46:19.266 --> 46:20.899
Cole, the house,

46:20.901 --> 46:23.802
but please, please, don't
take her away from me.

46:23.804 --> 46:26.071
I don't deserve that. Nobody does.

47:54.188 --> 47:55.988
Hi. What are you doing here?

47:55.990 --> 47:57.356
Do you really think that
I would stab Noah Solloway?

47:57.358 --> 47:59.191
No! What? I... no, of course not.

47:59.193 --> 48:00.660
Then why did you send the police to me?

48:00.662 --> 48:02.060
- I didn't.
- Jesus, Ali,

48:02.062 --> 48:03.663
would you just stop lying for a second?

48:03.665 --> 48:04.997
Well, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

48:04.999 --> 48:08.300
They ca... they came
here, and they asked me...

48:08.302 --> 48:09.801
all right, you know what?

48:09.803 --> 48:12.304
I... never mind.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.071
Look, I'm sorry.

48:14.073 --> 48:15.640
About everything. I...

48:18.378 --> 48:20.978
Did you build that?

48:23.983 --> 48:26.149
Yeah.

48:26.151 --> 48:28.985
For her birthday.

48:32.925 --> 48:34.991
Look. Watch.

48:50.842 --> 48:54.109
I thought if she stayed over,
I could surprise her with it.

48:59.616 --> 49:03.685
I know we're in a terrible situation.

49:03.687 --> 49:08.289
And I-I know I-I'm the
one that put us there.

49:08.291 --> 49:12.026
I know I did an awful thing.

49:12.028 --> 49:14.763
But I came back.

49:14.765 --> 49:18.298
And I'm here, and I'm not leaving again.

49:20.069 --> 49:22.970
I'm gonna stay in this town watching you...

49:27.443 --> 49:31.245
Watch... watching you love somebody else.

49:31.247 --> 49:34.647
And watching you raise
Joanie with somebody else.

49:34.649 --> 49:39.218
And that's gonna have to be enough for me.

49:40.489 --> 49:43.723
You know, and there are days like today

49:43.725 --> 49:48.495
where I look around and I
think, "You know..."

49:48.497 --> 49:52.398
God, this is it.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.101
This is as good as it gets.

49:56.103 --> 49:59.938
"For the rest of my life."

49:59.940 --> 50:03.308
I wish I'd done it all differently.

50:03.310 --> 50:05.076
But I didn't.

50:07.747 --> 50:09.414
But the only thing I can do now is

50:09.416 --> 50:11.348
be brave enough to live
with the consequences,

50:11.350 --> 50:12.517
and I will.

50:12.519 --> 50:14.084
But please, please,

50:14.086 --> 50:18.956
you don't have to keep punishing me, okay?

50:18.958 --> 50:22.827
I promise you I am
punishing myself already.

50:22.829 --> 50:24.528
Alison.

52:38.590 --> 52:40.023
Cole?

53:20.028 --> 53:21.795
I tried calling.

53:25.300 --> 53:29.035
You can have Joanie on
Tuesday for her birthday.

53:29.037 --> 53:31.870
Cole said you wanted that.

53:31.872 --> 53:35.808
Yeah. Thank you.

53:35.810 --> 53:38.844
Well, I-I don't want
to be a monster, so...

53:38.846 --> 53:41.179
I-I'm sorry I said that. I...

53:41.181 --> 53:43.916
Maybe he's right. Maybe your bad decisions

53:43.918 --> 53:45.684
really are behind you.

53:49.422 --> 53:51.188
Don't make me regret this.
