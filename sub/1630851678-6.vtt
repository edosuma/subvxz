WEBVTT

01:12.594 --> 01:14.030
Breakfast!

01:15.379 --> 01:17.381
I'll just hit send real--

01:17.425 --> 01:19.166
Now!
Yep! Okay, okay!

01:19.209 --> 01:22.169
<i>Lord Frankerton,
may I join you
at the window?</i>

01:22.212 --> 01:24.127
<i>Only if you wish
to torment me.</i>

01:25.172 --> 01:27.391
Whoa!
Someone didn't sleep.

01:27.435 --> 01:31.134
Nope. I spent all night
researching ways
to get you guys home.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.571
And possibly the night
before that.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.399
You? Researching?

01:35.443 --> 01:38.402
Who are you
and what have you done
with my daughter?

01:38.446 --> 01:40.187
Har! Har!
So, I was thinking,

01:40.230 --> 01:43.015
what if there's
a second calamity box
here on Earth?

01:43.059 --> 01:45.148
So I mapped out
every thrift store
in a 50-mile radius,

01:45.192 --> 01:46.758
- and if we leave right now--
- Pass.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.196
<i>Primthistle Manor
isn't gonna binge itself.</i>

01:49.239 --> 01:50.197
Everyone, quiet.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.939
Lord Frankerton's
confessing his love
for Lady Franklin.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.332
<i>My dearest Lady Franklin,</i>

01:55.376 --> 01:59.293
<i>I simply cannot contain
my passion for you any longer.</i>

01:59.336 --> 02:00.990
<i>Oh, Lord Frankerton.</i>

02:02.470 --> 02:04.950
Amazing!
I'm shocked.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.083
And it only took
three seasons.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.217
Why does it feel like
I'm the only one trying to find
a way back to Amphibia?

02:10.260 --> 02:11.653
Anne,
we have been trying.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.612
But it's okay to take a day off
to recharge every now and then.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.398
There's no time, you guys.
Come on. Let's get back
to research.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.444
Since you seem
to enjoy research
so much now,

02:20.488 --> 02:23.534
what if you four
spend the day at the museum
and wrote a report?

02:23.578 --> 02:26.320
You have a lot
of makeup
schoolwork to do.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.454
Oh! Do we have to?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.282
Yes. I'm also
cleaning the house.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.370
There's slime everywhere.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.067
And I'm not
pointing fingers,

02:35.111 --> 02:36.895
but I need you all
out of the way.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.247
Gross, Anne.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.210
<i>Energy sensor unresponsive.</i>

02:47.254 --> 02:50.257
<i>Will attempt to hack into
the local frequencies.</i>

02:55.697 --> 02:58.787
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
Have fun, but also learn.

03:03.531 --> 03:04.967
Ooh!

03:07.317 --> 03:10.320
Whoa! Looks like
you guys used to have
a monster problem too.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.411
Ooh.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.414
Wait. Your people think
the world is round?

03:18.328 --> 03:19.503
Wow!

03:20.287 --> 03:22.463
I like these guys.
They get it.

03:22.506 --> 03:27.294
See? We can have a fun one-off
just like we did in Amphibia.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.296
Anne? Anne?
What?

03:29.339 --> 03:31.689
You gotta take a break
from all of this research.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.430
Don't worry, HP.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:33.474 --> 03:37.434
Burning yourself out
isn't gonna help us
get home to Amphibia.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.741
Amphibia.
Yeah,
that's what I said.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.438
No. Look!

03:43.701 --> 03:46.400
Call me crazy,
but that looks like--

03:46.443 --> 03:48.924
One of us!
I don't believe it.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.274
Could this be the clue
we've been looking for?

03:51.318 --> 03:54.277
Didn't expect to see
frogs in here, eh?

03:54.321 --> 03:55.235
What? Frogs? Huh?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.760
Oh. You're talking
about the pod.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.762
Sure. What'd you think
I was talking about?

04:00.805 --> 04:03.286
Name's Dr. Jan.
I'm a curator here.

04:03.330 --> 04:07.290
And an avid lover
of all things ancient.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.509
Why did she wink at me?

04:08.552 --> 04:13.122
So staring at this pod, eh?
Interesting, isn't it?

04:13.165 --> 04:15.864
The frog here was depicted in
a very unconventional fashion.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.431
Bipedal. Oh!

04:17.474 --> 04:19.302
It must've been
some kind of deity.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.999
Huh. You don't say.

04:21.043 --> 04:25.352
Maybe it's
a frog-shaped alien, right?
From another dimension.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.440
What?

04:26.483 --> 04:27.310
Frog-shaped?

04:27.354 --> 04:28.877
Sorry, sorry.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.968
I'm really into kryptons.
You know, UFOs and stuff.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.406
Anyway, you got
any other questions?

04:36.450 --> 04:37.886
Do you know anything
about portals to--

04:37.929 --> 04:42.020
Nope, not at all.
Actually, I hate history
and museums. Yuck.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.720
Oh, that's too bad.
And kind of insulting.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.462
Well, if you change your mind,
just holler, "Dr. Jan!"

04:48.505 --> 04:51.508
And I'll fly in like
an information superhero.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.338
Uh-- Dr. Jan away!

04:59.168 --> 05:02.432
Hey! Why did you blow her off?
Maybe she knows something.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.043
What? Come on, dude.
We don't know anything
about that lady.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.437
How do you know
we can trust her?
Paranoid much?

05:07.481 --> 05:09.352
But that thing's
our first real clue.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.441
Agreed.
We can't just drop it.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.225
What if there's a map
painted on the bottom?

05:13.269 --> 05:15.358
Or a secret code
that only shows up
under black light?

05:15.402 --> 05:19.188
Well, if you don't wanna
ask that Dr. Jan for help,
what are we gonna do?

05:19.231 --> 05:21.451
Rob the museum?

05:21.495 --> 05:24.149
I still can't believe
we're robbing the museum.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.412
Shh!
Anne?

05:25.455 --> 05:26.630
You guys okay in here?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.632
All good.
Just finishing that report.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.678
Don't believe you,
but okay.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.594
Looks like
she bought it.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.378
Anne.
Huh? Where was I?

05:35.422 --> 05:38.163
Oh, yeah. We did
way more dangerous stuff
in Amphibia.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.209
At least nothing here's
gonna spit acid at us.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.819
That you know of.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.213
Come on, guys.
If you don't break
a few rules for this,

05:44.256 --> 05:45.475
how are we ever
gonna get back?

05:47.259 --> 05:48.173
So, what's the plan?

05:54.702 --> 05:56.573
Hmm.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.837
Aha! Very into this.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.841
First, we gotta
distract the guards.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.408
Hop Pop?
On it.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.757
So, my question is

06:06.801 --> 06:09.630
how did those bones
get underground
in the first place?

06:09.673 --> 06:12.197
Meow! I'm a cat!

06:15.287 --> 06:16.811
Hey, my shoe!

06:16.854 --> 06:18.334
After that
fabulous cat.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.120
Then, Polly,
you get us inside.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.346
Sup, fools?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.478
Lastly, Sprig,

06:31.521 --> 06:33.480
you take out
all the cameras.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.101
<i>Target found.</i>

06:50.322 --> 06:52.063
Those guards got
tired of chasing me

06:52.107 --> 06:53.500
and stopped at
a coffee shop.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.936
We got a good
20 minutes.

06:54.979 --> 06:58.156
Nicely done.
Now, all we have
to do is-- is--

06:59.897 --> 07:02.117
Hey, Anne!
Not a good time to nap!

07:02.160 --> 07:04.598
Right! Sorry.
Let's do this thing.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.819
That's a lot
of lasers.

07:08.863 --> 07:12.214
Don't worry.
I got this.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.659
Aha!

07:22.703 --> 07:24.356
Wow! That was easy.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.097
This isn't a movie,
Sprig.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.143
Not everything
has a dramatic twist.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.803
Not you again!

07:46.814 --> 07:48.032
Hey!

07:49.164 --> 07:52.167
Leave them alone!

08:10.751 --> 08:12.143
Eat the rich!

08:16.191 --> 08:17.627
How're we gonna stop
this thing?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.152
I think I just got an idea.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.157
Hey, can opener,
wanna fight?

08:26.201 --> 08:27.376
I'm all yours!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.511
Let's rumble, robot!

08:44.959 --> 08:46.743
<i>Any last words?</i>

08:46.787 --> 08:49.050
You're history.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.144
Anne!

08:56.187 --> 08:58.015
Don't worry, guys.
We got him.

09:02.846 --> 09:06.154
<i>No, you're history.</i>

09:06.197 --> 09:08.330
Freeze!
Put your hands in the...

09:09.461 --> 09:10.506
air?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.987
<i>Alert, alert.
Do not be seen.</i>

09:18.775 --> 09:21.082
No way. A robot?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.300
I'm fine, HP.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.302
Thank frog
no one got hurt.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.956
Oh, no.
Guys, your disguises!

09:27.131 --> 09:30.265
Frog aliens?

09:30.308 --> 09:31.658
What the--

09:31.701 --> 09:34.182
I-I can't believe I forgot!

09:34.225 --> 09:37.881
Mitchell, Rodney, this has been
a terrible misunderstanding.

09:37.925 --> 09:43.757
These are performers rehearsing
an exciting historical
reenactment of some kind.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.280
We'll clean this
mess up tomorrow.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.238
You two can go home.
I'll take it from here.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.849
Whew!
Thank goodness!
I knew it.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.154
Night, Dr. Jan.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
Oh, hey, Dr. Jan.

09:53.114 --> 09:57.509
So, there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation
for all of this.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.860
And I can't wait
to hear it.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.123
Frog aliens, robots.
Spill it, kid!

10:02.166 --> 10:04.734
This is a dream
come true!

10:04.778 --> 10:06.562
We can't do this
on our own, Anne.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.043
Maybe it's time
we try trusting someone.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.308
Wow! Sound like you've
been through a lot.

10:13.351 --> 10:16.659
I see why you're in
such a rush for answers,
but why the heist?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.139
Why didn't you just ask me?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.445
Uh, made sense earlier.

10:20.489 --> 10:23.144
If I'm honest,
I'm sort of running
on empty right now.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.711
She hasn't slept
in days.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.887
Well, that's no good.
Here. Look at this.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.891
Back when I was younger
I would stay up for days
on a dig.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.763
I couldn't go home knowing
we were so close.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.157
One time I got sloppy
with a dynamite charge

10:36.200 --> 10:39.116
and, well, this was
a triceratops.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.336
What's a triceratops?

10:41.379 --> 10:43.512
I get it.
So what you're saying is

10:43.555 --> 10:46.297
if I keep this up
I may do more harm
than good?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.821
Here.
I'll make you a deal.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.345
I'll keep your secret
and help you research
this artifact

10:50.388 --> 10:52.260
if you go home
and get some sleep.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.305
Deal. Thanks, Dr. Jan.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.265
Real quick. Before we go,
do you have a black light?

10:57.308 --> 11:00.181
I wanna check and see
if this baby has any
secret codes on it?

11:00.224 --> 11:03.140
Black light? Go sleep.
Take a day off.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.100
The world will still
be spinning tomorrow.

11:06.143 --> 11:09.364
Still not sold on
this spinning globe theory.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.370
Oh, what the heck?

11:19.635 --> 11:21.202
No way.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.334
You've got to be kidding me!
