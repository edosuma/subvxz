15:52.618 --> 15:54.452
It was with you and me,

15:54.578 --> 15:58.665
and we were working
in this sleazy shithole motel

15:58.791 --> 16:00.500
down in Miami, Florida.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.503

17:49.693 --> 17:52.445
well, not too long ago,
but um...

17:52.571 --> 17:55.490
that you told me that you'd give me
$1,000 to go to Europe

17:55.616 --> 17:57.075
if I finish school.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.078

You were right.

that's what I'd like to do.

From all of us jointly.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.047

twenty-five bucks a car?

Paid? You don't get paid.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.719
You kidding? You work on commission.
That's better than being paid.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.348

two or three hundred dollars.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.393
Fifty-thousand-dollar Porsche
might make you five grand.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.646

People think this guy's a cop,

19:23.287 --> 19:25.163
they're going to think
you're packing something.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.249
They don't fuck with you
so much.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.127
- Are you?
- Am I what?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.754
- Packin' something.
- Huh.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.756
Only an asshole
gets killed for a car.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.968
Guys who make it are the guys
who get into their cars at any time.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.805
Get in at 3:00am, get up at 4:00.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.560
That's why there ain't a repo man I know
that don't take speed.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.938
Speed, huh?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.695
Jesus Christ!

20:00.991 --> 20:04.160
Never broke into a car,
never hot-wired a car, kid.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.745
I never broke into a trunk.

20:06.830 --> 20:10.041
I shall not cause harm to any vehicle
nor the personal contents thereof,

20:10.167 --> 20:15.838
nor through inaction let that vehicle or the
personal contents thereof come to harm.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.299
That's what I call
the repo code, kid.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.177
Don't forget it,
etch it in your brain.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.554
Not many people got a code
to live by any more.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.516
Hey! Hey, look at that.
Look at those assholes over there.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.937
Ordinary fucking people, I hate 'em.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.231
- Me too.
- What do you know?

20:33.357 --> 20:37.735
See, an ordinary person spends
his life avoiding tense situations.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.780
Repo man spends his life
getting into tense situations.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.407
Assholes!

20:43.533 --> 20:45.409
Let's go get a drink.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.744
Tense situations, kid.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.746
Get into five or six of them a day
and they don't mean shit any more.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.581
I mean I seen men stabbed,
and it didn't mean shit.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.833
I've seen guns.
Guns too, they don't mean shit,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.502
but that's when
you got to watch yourself.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.421
Here. I'll handle it, pal.
Uh, settle down.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.134
Have a nice day.
Or night.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.761
Night, day,
it doesn't mean shit

21:10.769 --> 21:13.854
- Wasn't that Otto?
- Otto who?

21:47.639 --> 21:50.391
There's going to be some bad shit
coming down one of these days, kid.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.561
Oh, yeah?
Where you going to be?

21:53.687 --> 21:55.271
On the moon? (Chuckles)

21:55.397 --> 21:59.400
Uh-uh, I'm going to be right here
heading north at a hundred and ten per.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.777
In this junker?

22:11.955 --> 22:13.331
Cool car.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.375
Uh-oh!
The Rodriguez brothers.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.793
Motherfucker just flipped you off.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.421
Roll the window down.
Roll the window down.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.262
- Watch it, motherfucker.
- Hey, fuck you, pussy punk.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.556
Holy shit.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.141
Want me to take them?

22:36.396 --> 22:38.856
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hey!

23:01.838 --> 23:06.467
Goddamn dipshit
Rodriguez gypsy dildo punks!

23:06.593 --> 23:08.386
I'll get your ass!

23:08.512 --> 23:10.721
Wow!

23:10.847 --> 23:12.723
That was intense.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.850
Repo man's always intense.

23:14.976 --> 23:18.687
- Come on, let's go get a drink.
- (Laughs) Gee, bud.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.357
You never told me
it was going to be like this, man.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.818
Cops and robbers.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.569
Real live car chases.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.905
Whoo!

23:43.797 --> 23:44.880
You dummy!

23:45.006 --> 23:47.299
If you say our names, we'll have
to kill all these people, Archie.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.551
They all ran away.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.302
Come on, you douchebags.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.486
Awful quiet in here.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.406
Too quiet.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.910
So, who are these Rodriguez boys?

24:15.036 --> 24:18.497
Rodriguez brothers.
Lagarto and Napoleon.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.249
Two notorious delinquents

24:20.375 --> 24:23.836
currently responsible
for at least thirty vehicles in the field.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.463
Scumbags.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.298
They ain't scumbags.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.592
They're car thieves just like us.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.095
There's Miss Magruder.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.680
You want to go for it?

24:37.809 --> 24:40.186
Good gag.
You pull this one a lot?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.563
Only on the women.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.190
It never fails.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.694
Excuse me?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.279
Miss Magruder?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.990
I have something here for you.

24:56.119 --> 24:58.746
Mmm, how utterly charming.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.041
Ow! Ow!

25:04.878 --> 25:06.712
Ow! Motherfucker!

25:09.090 --> 25:10.674
Lite!

25:10.800 --> 25:12.384
I'm blind, man.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.396
Bruce I Peason,
brokerage consultant.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.316
Fucking millionaire,
six payments behind.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.777
- I've never understood it.
- What's that?

25:29.903 --> 25:32.404
The fucking millionaires.
They never pay their bills.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.948
See you at the yard.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.783
- Let me get this one.
- No, I'll handle this one.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.661
Mr Peason is carrying a permit
for a pistol.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.998
- Hey! Hey, hey! Give me that.
- Don't underestimate me, Ace.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.549
And also, naturally, I would
like them to be right next to each other.

25:51.675 --> 25:55.553
In addition, I would like them to be
as close to the window as possible,

25:55.679 --> 25:58.764
so I can sit in my car
and watch my things.

25:58.890 --> 26:03.394
So, all you have to do is take
your clothes out of here like this

26:03.520 --> 26:05.938
and put them into a machine
over there like that.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.777
Oh, my god! Oh!

26:11.903 --> 26:13.779
Oh, my god! Stop!

- Fuck you.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.061
Don't worry about that, come on.
You give it a try, all right?

31:01.651 --> 31:03.861
I knew we'd find it, boy.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.362
- Come on
- Got it.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.416
Let's get out of here.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.049
Oh, man!

31:33.057 --> 31:34.725
Put your seat belt on, boy.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.978
I don't ride with anybody
unless they wear their seatbelt.

31:38.104 --> 31:40.022
It's one of my rules.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.160
Put that damn gun down, boy.
It ain't no toy.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.786
Shit.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.420
I walk into someone's place of work.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.380
They're shit scared.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.507
They know I'm not a cop.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.718
They think I've come to kill 'em
and I would.

32:10.637 --> 32:15.223
I'd kill anybody who crosses me.
You know what I mean?

32:19.479 --> 32:21.480
- Do you like music?
- Sure.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.441
In that case
you're going to love this.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.653
I was into these dudes
before anybody.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.655
Partied with them all the time.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.282
Asked me to be their manager.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.534
I called bullshit on that.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.247
Managing a pop group?

32:39.374 --> 32:41.708
Hey, ain't no job for no man.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.757
Did you read
that book I gave you?

32:49.592 --> 32:51.343
- What book?
- Dioretix.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.804
- Science of matter over mind.
- Uh-uh.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.139
You'd better read it and quick.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.724
That book will change your life.

32:58.559 --> 33:02.187
Found it in a Maserati in Beverly Hills.
You know what I mean?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.566
A lot of people don't realise
what's really going on.

33:07.318 --> 33:11.822
They view life as a bunch
of unconnected incidents and things.

33:11.948 --> 33:15.909
They don't realise that there's
this, like, lattice of coincidence

33:16.035 --> 33:17.703
that lays on top of everything.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.706
I'll give you an example,
show you what I mean.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.128
Suppose you're thinking
about a plate of shrimp.

33:27.005 --> 33:31.008
Suddenly somebody will say, like,
"plate" or "shrimp" or "plate of shrimp",

33:31.134 --> 33:33.468
out of the blue, no explanation.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.470
No point in looking for one either.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.182
It's all part of a cosmic
unconsciousness.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.811
You eat a lot of acid, Miller,
back in the hippie days?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.230
I'll give you another instance.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.984
You know the way everybody's
into weirdness right now?

33:49.902 --> 33:53.447
Books in all the supermarkets
about Bermuda triangles.

33:54.490 --> 33:58.493
UFOs, how the Mayans
invented television.

33:58.619 --> 33:59.828
That kind of thing.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.496
I don't read them books.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.791
Well, the way I see it
it's exactly the same.

34:04.917 --> 34:09.045
There ain't no difference between
a flying saucer and a time machine.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.674
People get so hung up
on specifics,

34:12.800 --> 34:14.967
they miss out
on seeing the whole thing.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.346
Take South America, for example.

34:19.766 --> 34:24.018
In South America, thousands
of people go missing every year.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.105
Nobody knows where they go.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.400
They just, like, disappear.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.779
But if you think about it
for a minute...

34:35.572 --> 34:37.074
...you realise something.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.119
There had to be a time
when there was no people, right?

34:41.245 --> 34:42.621
Yeah, I guess.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.748
Well, where did all these people
come from?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.042
Hmm?

34:48.543 --> 34:50.962
I'll tell you where. The future.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.424
Where did all these people
disappear to, hmm?

34:55.217 --> 34:57.260
- The past?
- That's right!

34:57.386 --> 34:59.971
- And how did they get there?
- How the fuck do I know?

35:01.140 --> 35:03.100
Flying saucers.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.186
Which are really...

35:08.397 --> 35:09.981
Yeah, you got it.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.608
Time machines.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.364
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.911
I do my best thinking on the bus.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.996
That's how come I don't drive, see?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.832
You don't even know how to drive.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.544
I don't want to know how.
I don't want to learn, see?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.922
The more you drive...

35:35.591 --> 35:37.551
...the less intelligent you are.

35:42.890 --> 35:46.226
You know, I think I saw
one of those things once, them UFOs.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.395
I mean it was really...
it was kind of scary.

35:48.521 --> 35:52.649
I saw all these fucking
coloured lights and, uh, sounds.

35:52.775 --> 35:56.027
I mean, sounds and lights
like I never heard before.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.113
I mean it was really weird.

36:00.032 --> 36:03.118
Bud..
Yeah?

36:03.244 --> 36:05.245
Do you think all repo men
follow the code?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.330
Of course.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.710
Well, I mean you see
a lot of fucked up cars come in, but...

36:11.836 --> 36:15.088
99 times out of 100, it's the customer
who fucks them up.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.214
Assholes.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.979
I'm offering a thousands dollars
for his Falcon.

36:31.105 --> 36:33.982
You know what that is, Napoleon?
It's a bribe.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.067
'Who the hell is this?
Napoleon?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.319
'Who the fuck are you calling?'

36:37.445 --> 36:40.655
It's a grand if you show me
where his car is, Napoleon.

36:40.781 --> 36:43.617
'Ah, go fuck yourself, asshole.'

36:43.743 --> 36:45.202
Hello?

36:46.537 --> 36:47.746
Prick.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.668
Sixty-four Chevy Malibu.
Twenty grand.

36:53.794 --> 36:54.920
Waiting!

36:55.046 --> 36:57.088
We could buy ten of them
for that, Marlene.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.382
- Think you can find it now?
- (Bud) Not going anywhere!

36:59.508 --> 37:01.593
Now how come
this junk is worth so much?

37:01.719 --> 37:04.095
What's in it? Drugs?

37:05.014 --> 37:06.598
Got all night, amigos.

37:06.724 --> 37:10.727
Hermanos Rodriguez
don't approve of drugs.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.979
Neither do I,
but it's my birthday.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.814
I'm going to get your ass!

37:15.942 --> 37:18.235
That motherfucker's still down there.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.697
Don't care
how long it takes, dildos.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.743
Repo man's got all night
every night.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.758
Jesus Christ,
twenty thousand dollars.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.098
'Hi, this is Leila.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.059
'I'm not here right now,
so please leave your name, number

37:51.185 --> 37:53.770
'and a brief message
and a time you called at the beep.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.313
'And please try to be frank.'

37:56.899 --> 37:59.401
'Hey, Leila!!
All right, um, this is Otto.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.194
'The guy who gave you
a ride and stuff.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.488
'I heard something about that car.'

38:03.614 --> 38:05.282
- (Leila) Otto?

38:17.503 --> 38:19.129
Otto.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.131
Otto, stop.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.466
You said you had
something to tell me.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.469
Otto?

38:27.179 --> 38:29.139
- Otto!
- Huh?

38:29.265 --> 38:31.599
What did you want to tell me?

38:31.726 --> 38:32.892
Oh!

38:33.019 --> 38:34.811
Take off your clothes.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.607
- I'm at work, Otto!
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.402
- Your work is different than mine.
- Says who?

38:42.528 --> 38:44.779
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.074
Well, the least you could do
is give me a blow job.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.579
I guess that means no.

38:52.705 --> 38:53.955
Leila?

38:54.790 --> 38:57.125
We have a cell meeting
in two minutes' time.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.503
Thanks, Deirdre.
I'll be right there.

39:09.930 --> 39:13.683
See, that motherfucker only thinks
I don't know what's going on, Lite.

39:13.809 --> 39:16.144
As soon as I find that Chevy,
I'm going indie.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.982
I'm going to buy myself a tow truck,
a couple of pitbulls, and run a yard.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.944
Sit around and watch everybody else
do the work for a while.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.906
No way you can do that
on twenty grand, man.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.199
The hell I can.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.535
As long as you have good credit,
and my credit is spotless.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.708
Credit is a sacred trust.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.712
It's what our free society
is founded on.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.298
You think they give a damn
about their bills in Russia?

39:46.592 --> 39:50.387
I said do you think they give a damn
about their bills in Russia?

39:50.513 --> 39:53.223
They don't pay bills in Russia.
It's all free.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.599
All free?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.976
Free, my ass!
What are you, a fucking commie?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.978
- Huh?
- No, I ain't no commie.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.731
Well, you'd better not be.
I don't want no commies in my car.

40:03.609 --> 40:05.026
No Christians, either.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.718
I'll deal with you later..
I've got a customer to attend to.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.471
You too.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.808
Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum, sir?

40:50.823 --> 40:52.824
Need a vacuum, sir?

41:13.471 --> 41:16.222
Oh, hey! Do you want me
to check the trunk?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.142
Excuse me.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.027
- Hi! I'm Kevin!
- Hey, buddy! How you doing, huh?

41:29.153 --> 41:31.321
Hey, don't you remember me?
I was here yesterday.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.699
Listen, I think I left a book of matches
over in your office over there.

41:34.825 --> 41:35.950
You want to go
check for me, huh?

41:36.076 --> 41:37.994
- Sure thing.
- Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.747
- Anything for you, babes.
- All right, you're beautiful. I love you.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.332
Be right back.

42:00.851 --> 42:01.851
What?

42:10.945 --> 42:12.487
It's really very simple,
Mrs Parks.

42:12.613 --> 42:16.157
You don't want me to take your car,
and I don't want to take your car.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.660
Now, I said to the boss, I said,

42:18.786 --> 42:21.412
"Look, I do not want to repossess
this lady's car."

42:22.331 --> 42:25.041
Well, I've been in the hospital,
you see.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.668
Yeah. Yes, I understand.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.213
My job is really on the line over this one.
I mean, I could lose it right away.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.842
I'll see if I can borrow some money
from somewhere.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.136
That's terrific. Really terrific.

42:41.767 --> 42:45.353
- Oh, how was the rehearsal, son?
- It was okay.

42:45.479 --> 42:49.107
- Who's this?
- Oh, this is Mr Otto, Gary.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.901
From the finance company.

42:52.027 --> 42:55.613
He's been telling me that he isn't
going to take the car this time,

42:55.739 --> 42:57.699
even though he could.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.246
Well...

43:04.957 --> 43:06.791
Gotta get going here.

43:21.181 --> 43:23.057
Did you like the tea?

43:24.852 --> 43:26.728
- The tea?
- Uh-huh.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.396
Yeah, it was terrific.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.026
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:33.152 --> 43:34.736
Uh, excuse me.

43:41.493 --> 43:44.120
I gave you the money
last week to pay it.

43:44.246 --> 43:47.123
And you didn't do it.
What did you do with it?

43:47.249 --> 43:50.126
I'm so tired of giving you money
and you squandering it.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.377
I know what you done.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.463
You all went out dancing somewhere.
That's what you did.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.089
Now listen, next time
I give you some money,

43:55.215 --> 43:57.884
I want you to put it in the car, ya hear.
You're working.

43:58.010 --> 44:01.012
How come you didn't do it?
I don't know what's happened to you.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.851
You'll be sorry...

44:34.588 --> 44:37.048
Hey, it's cool, man. It's cool.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.175
I like music too, man, hey.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.678
Ow! Ow!

44:58.904 --> 45:00.363
Some people aren't cut out
to be a repo man.

45:00.489 --> 45:02.281
Why don't you smarten up, kid?

45:02.408 --> 45:04.659
Fuck you, Plettschner!
Ow! Ow!

45:04.785 --> 45:08.079
Don't you say fuck you to me.
Don't you know who I am?

45:08.205 --> 45:09.330
Yeah, you're Plettschner.

45:09.456 --> 45:11.791
You're fucking right, I'm Plettschner.
Otto Plettschner.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.043
Three times decorated
in two world wars.

45:14.169 --> 45:16.629
I was killing people while you were still
swimming around in your father's balls.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.172
You little scumbag!

45:18.298 --> 45:21.759
I worked five years in a slaughter house
and ten years as a prison guard in Attica.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.553
- So what?
- So what?

45:23.679 --> 45:25.680
So never say fuck you to me.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.765
Because you haven't
earned the rights yet.

45:28.934 --> 45:31.102
Hey, kid, I need a contract driver.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.397
See what I mean, punk?

45:38.193 --> 45:40.278
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

45:41.739 --> 45:44.282
- You little scumbag.
- (Lite) Shut up, Plettschner.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.200
Don't you ever tell me to shut up.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.709
Shit!

45:56.503 --> 45:58.296
It's too hot in here, man.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.882
What the hell's going on?

46:01.967 --> 46:05.136
So fucking hot I think that shit
in the trunk is going to melt.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.013
I think we better take a look,
all right?

46:10.893 --> 46:11.976
Go get us two sodas.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.770
All right,
as soon as I check the trunk.

46:13.896 --> 46:17.523
We're just the mules.

46:17.649 --> 46:19.442
All right.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.856
- 'Helping hand.'
- Marlene! We've found the car.

47:00.567 --> 47:01.776
Come on, guys!

47:07.533 --> 47:09.909
- Get the lead out.
- Stop pushing, Duke.

47:12.037 --> 47:13.955
- My medication.
- Aw, man!

47:14.081 --> 47:16.207
Aw, be cool dude. We got more.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.376
Aw, let me help you, Archie dear.

47:18.502 --> 47:19.502
Come on, come on.

47:19.628 --> 47:21.504
♪ Da-dah-dee-dee-dee-dah...

47:31.390 --> 47:34.141
Yeah, well, that's not the only thing,
Marlene, this car is hot.

47:34.268 --> 47:35.476
'What do you mean? Stolen?'

47:35.602 --> 47:37.812
- No, I mean it's hot, really hot.
- 'Hot?'

47:37.938 --> 47:40.147
Yeah, we're sweating like pigs, man.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.066
'I got the papers.
Where is the car from?'

47:42.192 --> 47:43.985
It's from someplace, uh...

47:44.778 --> 47:46.028
Roswell, New Mexico.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.356
Me??
Fight in a war, man?

48:22.482 --> 48:23.941
Fuck, no way!

48:24.067 --> 48:28.154
Nobody's got to do that shit.
Not in this country.

48:29.114 --> 48:32.158
A new ID don't cost no more
than a pink slip.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.118
You know what I mean?

48:34.661 --> 48:35.995
Something wrong?

48:38.665 --> 48:40.207
You know Marlene?

48:41.543 --> 48:43.127
Man, she's pretty hot.

48:44.963 --> 48:46.297
Otto, my man.

48:47.257 --> 48:50.259
I jumped on that action from day one.

48:50.385 --> 48:52.470
I found out
where she was coming from.

48:54.097 --> 48:56.641
- See ya back at the yard.
- Have fun.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.076
Holy shit.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.122
Holy shit!

50:01.248 --> 50:02.456
Lite!

50:03.542 --> 50:05.751
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.296
Lite! Lite!

50:12.050 --> 50:13.259
Lite!

50:13.385 --> 50:15.011
Lite! Open the door.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.430
There's a maniac in there.
What are you doing?

50:17.556 --> 50:19.807
Jesus! Open the door, man!
What are you doing?

50:19.933 --> 50:22.518
What are you doing?
Open the door.

50:22.644 --> 50:24.103
Lite!

50:24.229 --> 50:26.605
You're still on the job, white boy.
Get in the car.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.567
Open the door, man,
open the fucking door.

50:29.693 --> 50:30.943
Open the door, Lite.

50:31.069 --> 50:33.029
- Get in the car.
- Jesus Christ.

50:49.796 --> 50:51.213
You're crazy, Lite.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.341
I mean you can't just shoot
into people's houses.

50:55.385 --> 50:58.220
- I mean, maybe you shot the guy.
- What if I did?

50:59.264 --> 51:01.766
Well, I don't know.
I mean, that's pretty severe.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.398
Jesus Christ.

This is bullshit, Oly.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:55.020

when the marshal woke me up

at 4:00 this morning.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.107
Unfortunately it isn't bullshit,
it's a summons.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:01.735
Well, bullshit.
You should have refused to accept it.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.111
Have you read it?

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:06.281

are suing us for malicious damage,

They're a couple of scumbags, Oly.
You know them.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.502
I know that, Bud. But we've got to
sit down and get our stories straight.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.879
Bullshit, you're taking their word
against mine.

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:22.672
I was there, remember?

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.384

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.772
So you can get the fucking
twenty thousand dollars for the Malibu.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:41.942
- Make it a fucking month.
- Yeah? Well, fuck you.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.904
On second thoughts, Budsky.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.739
Don't bother coming back at all.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.117
Great! I'll come back
and pick up my stuff later

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.787
when the fucking place
don't stink so bad.

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:01.378
- Shut up!

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.970
Fucking trash.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.305
Makes you wonder
how much they owe.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.140
Most of them are on the run.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:16.726
Don't even use their fucking
social security numbers.

01:04:17.728 --> 01:04:19.980
If there was just some way to find out
how much the motherfuckers owe

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:23.275
- and making 'em pay.
- Jesus Christ, Bud.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.194
They're winos,
they don't have any money.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.363
You think they'd be bums if they did?

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:30.949
- You want out? Do you?
- No!

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:32.701
What's the matter with you?

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:35.662
Don't you like your job any more?
Not too happy in your job?

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.708
I mean I feel like
we're not communicating any more.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.503
When we first started out
I thought I could teach you something,

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:45.797
share something with you,
for Christ's sake.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.049
Answer me!

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.536
'I'm picking up the dead.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.624
'I'm putting my hands
around this dead body.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:26.129
'I'm... I'm carrying
his limp torso to the truck, and...

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:30.008
'He feels like he's...
he's only been dead a little while, but...'

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:01.850
♪ Oh, dum de...

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.144
J Frank Parnell.

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:08.148
Ott, Ott...

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.611
You ever feel as if your mind
had started to erode?

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:16.823
No.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:20.744
Ever been to Utah?

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:24.581
Sir.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.292
I represent the Helping Hand
Acceptance Corporation.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:30.253
Radiation, yes indeed!

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:34.466
You hear the most outrageous lies
about it.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:39.804
Half-baked goggle-boxed do-gooders
telling everybody it's bad for you.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.806
Pernicious nonsense!

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:46.061
Everybody could stand
a hundred chest X-rays a year.

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:48.438
They ought to have 'em too.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:52.192
When they cancelled the project
it almost did me in.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.569
One day my mind
was literally bursting.

01:07:54.695 --> 01:07:56.446
The next day nothing.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.031
Swept away...

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.035
But I'll show them.

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:06.081
- I had a lobotomy in the end.
- Lobotomy?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.835
- Isn't that for loonies?
- Not at all.

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:12.837
A friend of mine had one.

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:15.256
Designer of the neutron bomb.

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:17.050
Ever hear of the neutron bomb?

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:20.470
Destroys people.

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.805
Leaves buildings standing.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.557
It fits in a suitcase.

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:28.728
It's so small no one knows it's there
until blammo.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.857
Eyes melt,
skin explodes, everybody dead.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:38.404
It's so immoral, working on the thing
can drive you mad.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.741
That's what happened
to this friend of mine.

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.076
So he had a lobotomy.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.912
Now he's well again.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.582
What kind of car does your...

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.002
...does your friend drive?

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:55.964
Chevy Malibu.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.259
This is really a nice old car.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.011
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What do you mean?

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.973
Well, I don't know. I mean...

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.227
- Don't you feel funny?
- Why should I feel funny?

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.648
The two hemispheres
are fundamentally at odds.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.651
Hemisphere, hemisphere.

01:09:16.777 --> 01:09:19.737
You know it's strange.
I do feel funny...

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.996
Ah...

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:01.005
Here's the young new-waver
we've all heard so much about.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:04.467
My old man had a mohawk
when I met him.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.178
He was in the service then.

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:10.640
He was such a monster.
I used to have to tell him no.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:14.811
My old man
was exactly the same way.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.437
Till we got married.

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.523
Hey, Oly..
Your wife's hanging all over Otto.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:22.151
Yeah. Like flies on shit.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.445
Um. Have you seen Bud
anywhere?

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:26.489
Who?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.030
Hey, Ace. Wait up.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.992
So, you want to talk about it?

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:12.744
Talk about what, kid?

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:18.207
- Why you're so damn mad at me.
- I'm not mad at you. God damn.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:21.002
- I'm not. I'm not mad at you.
- All right, okay.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.963
- Debbi??
- What?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.508
I've been thinking.

01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:31.387
Now that we've got some money

01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:33.931
and Archie's gone...

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.519
...don't you think it's time
we settled down?

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:42.148
Get a little house.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:45.777
I want you to have my baby.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:47.904
Why?

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.823
Well, I don't know.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.701
Everybody does it.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.246
And it just seems like
the thing to do and...

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.292
Arsehole!

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:05.213
Let's go do the job.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:15.014
Duke! Debbi!
What are you guys doing here?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.600
- What's it look like, Ace?
- Up against the wall.

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:22.980
I'm going to kill him.
I'm going to kill everybody. (Laughs)

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.982
Drop it, motherfucker!

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.951
Ow, shit!

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.813
Debbi...

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.732
Ah...

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.401
Ah, do you, uh...

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.820
Do you think it's too late for us
to get romantically involved?

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:12.488
I think a little.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:16.492
Wait! Wait! Stick with me.
I'll make you a repo wife.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.287
Bollocks.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.125
Here.

01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:43.853
- Otto?
- Yeah, I'm here, man.

01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:47.690
The lights are growing dim.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:54.197
I know a life of crime
led me to this sorry fate.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.158
And yet...

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:00.119
...I blame society.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:04.165
Society made me what I am.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.751
That's bullshit.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:10.296
You're a white suburban punk,
just like me.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:15.218
But it still hurts.

01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:24.727
You're going to be all right, man.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:32.527
Maybe not.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.407
Yep he's dead all right.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.535
- No doubt about it.
- He's a goner.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:41.786
Man.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.248
Look. Booth's setting him on fire.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:01.806
Where's the car, baby?

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.558
That Chevy Malibu, baby.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.101
Where's the car?

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.227
- Otto!
- Jeez.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.770
- You'd better stay out of this.
- Why?

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.189
It's none of your business.
You want to be a hero?

01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:13.651
- Or rather be a chicken man?
- What?

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.988
A chicken man. Did you ever see
a farmer's wife? Huh?

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.865
Let go of me!

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:21.742
It's peaceful, man.

01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:23.911
The Malibu.

01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:25.746
Yeah?

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:31.127
- Let's go
- No way, Marlene.

01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:35.256
My car's gone and we're going to get
to the bottom of this.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.008
Like hell we are.

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:39.677
Not in my face.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.596
Hold it, Marlene.
Freeze!

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.348
My face!

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:47.435
- Over my dead body.
- That's how it's going to have to be.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.645
Come and get me.
Come on.

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:52.648
I've been wanting to do that one
for a long time, honey.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.610
Come on. Come on.
Come on, if you think you're man enough.

01:16:56.236 --> 01:16:57.445
Hey, Plettsch.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:00.156
Coffee break.

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:16.213
Good evening, Otto.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.759
This is agent Rogersz.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.303
I'm going to ask you
a few questions.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:27.933
Since time is short and you may lie,
I'm going to have to torture you.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.936
But I want you to know
it isn't personal.

01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:35.149
'Look, ah...
This isn't really necessary.

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:36.442
'I'll tell you
anything you want to know.'

01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:39.862
Good!
Where is the Malibu?

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.489
'I don't know.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.282
'Somebody ripped it from the yard.'

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:49.455
I don't think he knows.

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:53.376
- Increase the voltage.
- But what if he's innocent?

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.462
No one is innocent.
Proceed.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:03.094
Ah, yes! Look at them.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.847
High heels, hair nets,
those ridiculous trench coats.

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:08.307
They're pathetic.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.268
Agent Rogersz,
they're getting away.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:12.812
It's all part of the plan.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:30.496
- Someone help me..
- Otto!

01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:32.665
Otto, pull yourself together.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.751
Marlene?

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.045
What's going on?

01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:39.839
We're going to the hospital.

01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:45.594
'Dr Benway to surgery.'

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:51.475
Hey, I know you.

01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:54.645
You're the one
that ran into my trash.

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:56.981
- Shh!
- Shh to you too.

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:04.530
'Visiting hours are now over.

01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.532
'Thank you for your assistance.'

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.911
Out of order.

01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:12.955
Take the stairs.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:25.009
'Mr Lee. Mr Lee.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:28.220
'Please return the scalpel.
Mr Lee.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:30.973
Otto?

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:46.155
- They're going through it all the time.
- Let me see that.

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:49.325
- All wrong. Do it over.
- And they won't pick it up.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.243
Oh, well isn't that a shame?

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:58.709
I tell you, it comes to something
when they expect you to pick it up.

01:19:59.419 --> 01:20:01.253
How are you doing, man?

01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:03.130
Ask him about the Malibu.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:05.883
Look, about the other night.

01:20:08.094 --> 01:20:09.762
I'm sorry I split.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.516
I know I should have stayed
with you, but ah...

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:17.311
It's like when I was a kid, you know,
I had this set of big wheels you know.

01:20:17.437 --> 01:20:19.230
Otto!

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.732
'Please be quiet in the stairwells.

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:24.985
'Please be quiet in the stairwells.'

01:20:37.123 --> 01:20:39.875
'A very sad
unchristian thing just happened.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.877
'A sweet old lady's car was stolen.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.129
'It's a Chevy Malibu.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.048
'Brothers and sisters.

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:49.718
'Please, if you've seen this car,

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.096
'just call this toll free number.'

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:54.181
- Shit.
- 'Praise the lord.'

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.352
Go, go, go!

01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:02.106
Come on. Go!

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:23.168
- Ow!

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.761
Dude, slow down.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.682
Stop!

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.276
All right, don't shoot!
Come on, all right, all right...

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:51.447
Chicken shits. (Clucks)

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:52.865
Where's the Malibu?

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.785
Don't even ask,
because I don't know.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.537
I mean, I don't have it,
Marlene doesn't have it,

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:00.205
you and your crazy friends
don't have it.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.499
So that only leaves...

01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:06.045
Where is he?

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:07.296
Where the fuck is he?

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:11.258
'He is risen,
Holy Jesus' name.'

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.077
- Later!
- Bye-bye.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.877
'Here's another weird one.

'Reports are coming in about apparent
hail of ice cubes south of downtown.

'Scientists are at a loss to explain
the freak showers of tiny cubes of ice.'

01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:29.420
That's some weird fucking shit.
Eh, Bud?

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:34.925
- What's going on, man?
- Shit.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.721
Eleven years of repoing cars
and what have I got?

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.139
Shit.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.017
Bud, listen to me.

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:46.353
You're sitting in a car
worth twenty thousand dollars.

01:23:46.479 --> 01:23:47.938
Look, we turn it in,
we take the money,

01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:49.857
and split it sixty-forty, you and me.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.319
Who gets the sixty, kid?

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:57.948
Well, I don't know. I figured
since I found the car first that, uh...

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.743
...you'd get it.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:06.749
'Get away from the car.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.959
'This is your only warning.'

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.794
We got problems, man.

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.678
No, no, no... Wait!

01:24:19.804 --> 01:24:21.638
Stop fucking around, man!

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.850
Only an asshole gets killed
over a car.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:27.770
You calling me an asshole, punk?

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.813
Yeah, I'm calling you an asshole.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:31.565
Come and get me, copper.

01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:34.735
I'm well armed
and I know where you live.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.114
Son of a fucking bitch.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.242
I would rather die on my feet
than live on my knees.

01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:48.248
Come on, out!

01:24:48.374 --> 01:24:51.293
Come on, you fucking popsicles,
let's get that car.

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.671
Hey Oly! Look at Bud?

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.009
We'll tow it to a cliff and drive it off.

01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:01.762
I have the papers on this car.
You guys want a beer?

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:05.182
- Hey Bud, want a beer?
- No, a cigarette.

01:25:05.308 --> 01:25:08.060
- No beer is needed here.
- Hey, what...

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:16.276
'Approaching the car. I'm encountering
a strange eerie kind of force field.

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:18.612
'I don't know what it is.
It's... it's...'

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.291
Come on, you popsicles.

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:46.598
God, I love this job.

01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:49.643
Linear and inverse vectors
merge in zero.

01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:51.770
This way, your holiness.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:04.199
It's more than a job, it's...
It's a calling.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:07.744
- Critical mass is at a point of zero.
- Why, you can say spiritual.

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:10.539
Spiritual?

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:16.295
Holy sheep shit!

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.261
'Get back, get back.'

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.979
Get back in there
or you don't get paid.

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.856
Have you read this book?

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:37.065
Dioretix.

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:40.235
- Chapter seven. Verse three.
- I've got it marked.

01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:49.244
Miller, what are you doing?

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.246
I'm going for a little spin.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:54.499
But you don't know how to drive.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.888
Otto, don't go.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.890
What about our relationship?

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:13.143
What?

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.271
What about our relationship?

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.149
Fuck that.

01:27:20.443 --> 01:27:21.902
You shithead!

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:24.154
I'm glad I tortured you!
How can you leave me?

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.073
I'm the one who's supposed to be
in that car.

01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:59.815
Best goddamned car
in the yard.

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:31.930
Wow!

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.724
This is intense.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:36.810
The life of a repo man
is always intense.
