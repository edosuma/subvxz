10:20.960 --> 10:23.088
Oh, my mom's here.
Got to go.

[slow music plays]

10:59.760 --> 11:01.091
Mr. Moran?

11:02.680 --> 11:04.045
Can I show you something?

11:10.680 --> 11:12.603
- Yeah, I've seen all these.
- Right. Yeah.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.923
But... a couple weeks ago,
his work started to change.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.883
He draws himself with other people.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.840
The colors are brighter.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.689
So he's... getting better?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.207
Well, we still have a ways to go

11:24.280 --> 11:25.520
to help him work through his trauma,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.443
but this is a positive step.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.284
Have you started cooking together?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.010
No, that's Dion.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.361
Oh.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.329
Well, having a support person
in his life

11:37.400 --> 11:39.402
really seems to be making
a difference.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.049
Yo, uncle!

11:44.720 --> 11:47.326
Hey, listen, man, uh, look,
I need some dough.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.891
You already owe me
for the plane ticket

11:48.960 --> 11:50.689
and the cash I floated you.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.331
Look, you know I wouldn't ask
you if it wasn't important, huh?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.369
- [Stavros] You in trouble?
- [Dion] Yeah, major.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.601
Tooth Fairy?

11:56.720 --> 11:58.961
Yeah, look, man,
he's on my ass for six G's.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.050
Look, I don't have
that kind of money here.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.088
It's Kittie with an I-E, right?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.484
There's a guy in Jersey
owes me for a job.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.925
[Stavros] <i>Give me a few hours.</i>

12:07.200 --> 12:09.282
I'll get on my bike and head over there.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.361
[Dion] Yeah, okay.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.807

12:50.240 --> 12:51.890
[Val] False alarm. It's just Tommy.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.047
Hey, where's Kevin?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.167
Uh, meeting a vendor,

12:54.280 --> 12:57.523
sucking the life out of people's
hopes and dreams. Who knows?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.045
Want me to kick your butt
in cribbage?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.610
Huh?
Go set up the board.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.928
And if you're looking
for something to draw,

13:03.040 --> 13:05.964
here's the face of the guy who's
gonna win, huh, right here.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.247
Do me a favor and dunk my head
in this crap

13:09.320 --> 13:11.209
and hold it down
until I stop breathing.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.605
- Hello?
- Hey.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.603
Hi. I'm here about a job.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.570
Oh, okay. Um, yeah, good.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.971
I'll get you an application.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.168
D-- Dude. Dude, dude.
Don't be rude, huh?

13:24.560 --> 13:27.211
Let's show the, uh-- the lovely
young lady around here.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.051
I'm Dion Patras.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.288
Uh, my partner, Tommy,
and I are the owners here.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.203
Oh, wow. Nice to meet you.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.281
Oh, nice to meet you, too.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.011
- I'm Laura.
- Laura. That's a beautiful name.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.127
- [chuckles]
- Well, welcome to Thirio.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.886
Let me show you around.
Look, this is the kitchen, obviously,

13:42.040 --> 13:43.929
you know, the belly of
the beast, right?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.281
And, uh,
this is the dining room,

13:46.440 --> 13:48.841
and you have to imagine it
with 25 steel-top tables

13:48.960 --> 13:50.007
all spread out here.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.731
- It's gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.206
Right, you know what?
You're gonna fit right in.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.327
[chuckles]

13:54.680 --> 13:57.251
So, what made you decide
to open a restaurant?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.126
Well, you know, I've been, uh-- I've been
cooking since I was a kid.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.601
- Mm.
- You know, I feel like it's something

14:02.680 --> 14:04.330
I was put on this Earth to do, you know?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.402
So you're an owner and a cook.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.767
Well, I'm a... I'm a chef.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.527
[chuckles]

14:11.400 --> 14:12.925
- Hmm.
- Hi.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.685
- Hi.
- [Tommy] Hi.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.569
So, have you waited tables before?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.688
Yeah, when I was 16.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.369
I'm not here about a waitress job.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.329
I, uh-- I'm a cook, too.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.561
Oh, right. I'm-- I'm sorry.
I thought you were here for--

14:26.640 --> 14:28.881
My dad hired me to work on the line.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.487
Your dad?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.207
Kevin Mahoney.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.770
The executive chef.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.285
I just, uh, came to drop off my paperwork.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.802
I guess we'll be seeing a lot
of each other.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.087
[sighs]

14:45.760 --> 14:49.242
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.890
Uh, your dad's not here
right now,

14:50.960 --> 14:53.167
but I'll make sure to get these
to the manager,

14:53.640 --> 14:54.766
and we'll see you, urn...

14:55.960 --> 14:57.564
when you start.

14:57.880 --> 14:58.961
- Thanks.
- Okay.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.491
Hey! Hey!

15:03.560 --> 15:05.130
What's the big deal, huh?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.924
So there's another cook on the line.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.923
- Yeah, his daughter.
- She might be good.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.526
Good?! Well, she looks like
she's never boiled an egg.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.045
Look, and how are
we gonna pay her, huh?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.963
Your dad's money's gonna
cover another salary?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.441
Actually, Aidan's not covering
much of anything lately.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.450
Right, right, so Kevin makes us
hire his precious little girl.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.170
Meanwhile, I got to un-hire
one of my guys.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.925
Look, man, I made promises, T.,
these guys left their jobs for me!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.604
I know. I know.
Look, this is our restaurant.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.409
What, we don't even get to hire
our own people?

15:28.480 --> 15:31.211
We signed a contract, okay?
It's too late.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.687
- We're stuck.
- No, no, you're stuck.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.645
I don't get stuck in anything.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.202
What?
What is this emergency?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.965
- I'm in the middle of a deposition.
- I just got one thing I need to ask you.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.371
Look, I need to get out of an agreement

15:58.440 --> 15:59.930
that I didn't know I was agreeing to.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.241
- Are you kidding me with this?
- Look, just-- just hear me out.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.322
All right, a contract is invalid

16:04.440 --> 16:06.841
if it has things buried in it
that weren't pointed out, right?

16:06.960 --> 16:09.201
Look, it's like those-- those
Internet contracts, you know?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.243
You click "agree" just to get on
with your life.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.526
Did you sign the contract?

16:13.960 --> 16:15.246
Yeah, yeah, I signed it.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.402
Then it's valid. I'm busy.

[cellphone ringing]

16:26.440 --> 16:29.808
- [Dion] Uncle, what's <i>going</i> on?
- Hey, I'm heading to New Jersey now.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.651
I should be back with your money
in about an hour.

- <i>[Dion] Great, see you later.</i>
- Okay.

I wake up five, six times a night.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.326
I'm moody. I'm telling you.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.007
This Chinese situation
is driving me tri-polar.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.487
[slow music plays]

16:49.000 --> 16:50.684
Is that that son of a bitch, Stavros?

16:52.480 --> 16:54.209

17:16.839 --> 17:17.887
Good morning.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.084
And that's the last good thing
I have to say.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.527
You lost the Sinclair Plaza contract.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.125
What the hell are you talking about?

17:26.200 --> 17:28.167
Troy Scaffolding underbid you.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.091
- We had a deal.
- [Ruth] Mm, you had a handshake,

17:31.320 --> 17:33.926
which doesn't mean crap
nowadays.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.281
- Damn it.
- Right. Boo-hoo.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.125
But that contract was supposed
to cover your medical expenses

17:40.200 --> 17:42.009
and that <i>fakakta</i> restaurant
you're starting.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.441
- So transfer some money.
- [Ruth] From where?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.564
You're no longer worth
what you think you are,

17:46.640 --> 17:48.085

I'd love to, Aidan,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.680
but I'm too busy trying to keep
your head above water.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.926
What am I paying you for?

17:55.440 --> 17:57.283
I thought you people were good
with money.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.124
I'm a Jew, not a magician.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.647
How are you, by the way?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.802
The treatments doing any good?

18:04.880 --> 18:05.927
I'm fine.

of the tidal wave.

in the heart of it.

you're running out of money.

I've been trying to reach you.

I must have called you
like ten times today.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.410
Listen, uncle, I need that cash.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.121
- Jesus, man. What happened?
- Motorcycle versus truck.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.247
You-- You okay?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.767
[scoffs]
I'm a tough, old bastard.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.521
You, uh... get the money?

18:44.640 --> 18:46.210
I was busy getting this.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.243
[Dion] Look, I know... l-- I'm sorry.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.050
Look, at least it's not worse, huh?

18:50.440 --> 18:53.284
My guy in Jersey took off
with the cash when I didn't show.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.481
Oh, j-- just forget the money,
huh?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.644
Just let me know if there's
anything I can do.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.167
I got hit by a truck. I'm good.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.801
I feel like you don't want
this relationship to work.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.167
I got no information for you.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.844
It's hard to believe you haven't
heard anything

19:20.920 --> 19:22.126
about that drug operation

19:22.200 --> 19:23.850
'cause I know how much time
you spent

divulge his deepest secrets

your white whale, all right?

No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna take this
to the next level, okay?

Look, I just told you I can't
give you what you want.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.161
And now you want more.

Look, Christ, what is it
with everybody, huh?

19:40.320 --> 19:42.368
You make an agreement,
and then they change it on you?

19:42.440 --> 19:45.410
Yeah, well, you know what?
A relationship is a two-way street.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.886
Yeah, if I'm gonna help you out,

then I need to get something out of it.

Patient unresponsive. Let's go.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.482
She got right back up.
She seemed fine.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.807
[siren wails]

20:48.240 --> 20:50.447
Aidan, it's Tommy. Call me back.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.370
Hey, yo, T., is Pilar here?

20:52.520 --> 20:56.002
Huh? No, look, whatever you
want to buy, forget it, okay?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.923
Gold-plated whisk-- too bad.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.081
I don't want to buy anything, all right?

20:59.160 --> 21:00.764
I just need some money
to pay my crew,

21:00.840 --> 21:02.490
who are <i>this</i> close
to bailing on me.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.800
Well, Pilar's not here.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.808
[Kevin] The key is to add
a little nutmeg to the rub.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.804
Hey, Patras, I'm demoing a new recipe,
in case you didn't notice.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.211
Oh, yeah, well, let me know
what you're making.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.568
I'll look it up
on deliciousdishes.com.

[light laughter]

21:20.200 --> 21:22.328
[mid-tempo music plays]

21:56.480 --> 21:58.482
[Tommy] All right, buddy,
I'll be back in a bit.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.530
No more ice cream. Finish that,
and then go get washed up.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.244
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.690
Uh, Kevin needs another case
of shiitakes.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.762
Well, can it wait?
I was hoping you could watch T.J.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.966
while I go talk to my dad.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.126
Well, T.J. can come with.
Hey, come on, champ!

22:17.000 --> 22:18.126
Come on. Let's go.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.725
Yeah, by all means, take the car.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.487
I'll take the subway.
It's only 50 below out.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.049
[slow music plays]

22:29.160 --> 22:30.844
- Yo, Cesar!
- Hey! [speaks Spanish]

22:32.280 --> 22:33.850
- <i>¿Cómo estás?</i>
- I'm good, man.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.570
Listen, you wouldn't mind
showing my buddy T.J.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.768
- how the forklift works, would you?
- Sure, let's go look.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.841
Have fun.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.200
- Ese.
- What's up, man?

22:40.280 --> 22:42.567
- Got something to sell?
- Yeah, I got something.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.370
[Cesar] Then I lift it up. Now...

22:48.760 --> 22:52.128
See this knob here?
That tilts the blades. Try it.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.010
<i>[whirring]
[man] Cesar Moreno to purchasing.</i>

22:56.080 --> 22:58.765
That's me.
Back in a minute, little man.

[mid-tempo music plays]

23:26.440 --> 23:28.090
[siren chirps]

23:30.240 --> 23:31.321
What you doing, kid?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.447
What was that?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.566
Answer me. Don't move!

23:36.640 --> 23:38.051
[guard] Hands out of your pockets, now!

23:38.680 --> 23:40.569
How did you get in here? Huh?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.525
What, you're too tough
to answer questions?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.604
Answer me when I talk to you!

23:44.680 --> 23:47.684
- Answer me!
- [Dion] Hey! Hey!

23:48.760 --> 23:51.127
Yo, yo, yo! Yo!
What the hell's going on?!

23:51.240 --> 23:52.287
- This kid with you?
- Yeah, he's with me.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.361
Just get off of him!

23:53.440 --> 23:55.010
He can't be running around here alone.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.531
This is a secure area.
- Dude, he's 10!

23:56.600 --> 23:58.125
Well, then you should keep
an eye on him, then.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.611
Yeah, you should learn how to do
your damn job, man!

23:59.680 --> 24:00.761
Get out of here!

24:02.520 --> 24:04.648
Oh, man, you okay? He hurt you?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.563
All right, come on. Let's get you home.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.291
What, that make you feel good?

24:15.320 --> 24:18.085
[door opens, closes]

24:19.040 --> 24:21.327
Why are you blowing off
our restaurant manager?

24:22.560 --> 24:25.131
That girl's the manager? Christ.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.562
You hired a bean-eater
as your bean-counter.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.689
And why aren't you returning my calls?

24:29.880 --> 24:31.644
Frankly, I don't enjoy talking to you.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.485
You know,
I don't give a damn what you enjoy,

24:34.560 --> 24:36.847
as long as you pay us
the money you owe.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.370
That money's tied up right now.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.204
You signed a contract.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.610
The same one where you--

24:43.680 --> 24:46.570
you buried the detail
about choosing your own chef.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.245
Eh.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.324
Why don't you read
the fine print of <i>my</i> contract?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.922
You don't give us the money
you owe us tonight,

24:57.080 --> 24:58.366
you don't see T.J. anymore.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.687
Fine.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.929
Then I'll hold on to the money.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.443
I'm saying, hypothetically,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.921
we could withhold T.J.'s visits.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.923
[scoffs] Jesus.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.568
You are the worst negotiator.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.360
A little advice?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.211
Next time you want to do business,
bring your partner.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.604
- Just send the money.
- I'll talk to my accountant.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.167

[voice breaking] I'm scared
she's never gonna wake up.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.482
None of this would have happened

26:21.600 --> 26:24.604
if I hadn't bothered her
with my stupid questions

26:24.680 --> 26:25.806
about managing a restaurant,

26:25.880 --> 26:28.611
which I know
next to nada about.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.689
I'm so in over my head.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.089
Health inspection in a week?
"No problem."

26:36.600 --> 26:37.965
What?

26:39.600 --> 26:40.806
It's only a matter of time

26:40.880 --> 26:43.611
before they fire me for being
a total fraud.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.488
I used to own a restaurant.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.211
Yo, big man, I got you a beer.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.844
Huh? Get out of here.
Go on. I got you milk.

[sighing]

27:10.720 --> 27:13.564
Listen, uh, Teej,
tonight really sucked, huh?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.361
Yeah.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.886
Yeah, truth is, uh,
that could happen again, you know?

27:22.240 --> 27:25.084
Well, it's the Bronx.
It will happen again.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.330
Listen, man.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.642
People are...gonna assume
things about you,

27:40.480 --> 27:44.087
you know, 'cause--
'cause you're black.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.686
You just got to know that.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.329
You got to know
how to protect yourself.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.724
All right,
if that ever happens to you again,

27:51.800 --> 27:54.451
with a-- with a cop, store owner,
a neighbor, whatever,

27:54.800 --> 27:59.840
you just-- you just
show them your hands, okay?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.247
Yeah, don't grab your phone,
make any sudden movements.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.561
You just--
just show them your hands.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.245
All right, you don't have to talk.

28:08.320 --> 28:12.689
You just-- just do exactly
what they say, okay?

28:14.400 --> 28:19.406
And this-- your hoodie--
that doesn't help.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.245
You know, you're, uh--

28:27.120 --> 28:29.600
You're gonna feel like
you want to fight back.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.364
But, you know,
sometimes it's-- it's better not to.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.202
Sometimes that only makes it worse.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.441
So you got to be smart.
And you got to--

28:41.040 --> 28:43.088
You got to know when to pick
your battles.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.563
[slow music plays]

28:52.040 --> 28:54.008
- What the hell?!
- I gave it some thought,

28:54.080 --> 28:56.367
and I canceled the order for your panels.
They're not gonna work.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.603
I thought we agreed to stick
to what's in the Look Book.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.769
Your wife was clearly a good artist.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.683
That does not make her an architect.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.131
It does not make her a chef.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.521
It's not your decision. It's Rie's.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.050
Tom, Rie's not here.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.324
And I'm sorry about that.
I truly am.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.966
But I'm trying to do the job
that I was hired to do, okay?

29:17.040 --> 29:18.451
You understand that?

29:32.120 --> 29:34.122
Look,uh“.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.321
The way I acted earlier
was unprofessional,

29:40.960 --> 29:42.849
and I apologize.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.450
I'm ready to get to work.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.080
Okay. Well, great.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.930
Start by prepping your mise.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.648
You're right. He's a total dick.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.324
Acts like he owns the place.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.569
- Well, what happened to "roll with it"?
- I didn't mean roll over.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.963
Look, he-- he got rid of Rie's panels.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.929
Look at this.
Are-- are you okay with these?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.686
Look, I know Rie's design
is important to you and me.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.965
But, yes, as a chef,
the lamps are practical.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.010
If we get slammed, we'll have plates

30:21.080 --> 30:22.241
dying on the pass without heat.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.731
And you know what? He's-- he's right.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.888
You know
the panels will cost us a fortune.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.447
And when did you have
this epiphany?

30:30.520 --> 30:33.285
Oh, look, I'm just tired
of losing sleep over this guy.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.125
Look, if we keep fighting him,

30:35.200 --> 30:36.690
we're the ones who end up
with black eyes.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.842
Hey, Patras, the walk-in's a mess.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.809
Get in there and organize it,
would you?

30:40.880 --> 30:41.927
Yes, Chef.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.850
[mid-tempo music plays]

30:53.240 --> 30:55.925
Tell Olszanski to expect a call
from the Deputy Mayor's office

30:56.040 --> 30:58.486
about expediting my friend
Ms. Herrera's request.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.525
Thanks, Joey.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.486
I don't know how you did that,
but thank you.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.040
It's gonna be crazy
getting everything ready.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.969
I'd hate for you to have gone
through all this trouble,

31:11.040 --> 31:12.644
and we don't pass
the inspection.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.207
You'll pass.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.891
[slow music plays]

31:21.160 --> 31:22.924
Patras, you're 30 minutes late.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.571
Sorry, Chef. Won't happen again.

Hey.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.891

31:54.160 --> 31:56.003
Hey, yo, T., we're-- we're cool, right?

31:56.160 --> 31:57.730
Where were you last night?

31:57.800 --> 32:00.929
I stayed with my Uncle Stavros.
He-- he needed a hand.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.331
He's still pretty banged up
from his accident.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.727
I see, so you selflessly agreed

32:04.800 --> 32:06.165
to spend the night at a brothel.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.925
He's very accommodating lately.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.287
Hey, Teej, jacket's not enough.
Go get your hoodie.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.286
You don't want to wear it?

32:16.480 --> 32:18.687
Okay, well, get something else.
It's cold.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.727
What the hell?

32:24.200 --> 32:25.361
Yo, the-- the hoodie thing?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.283
That could be because of
something I said.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.770
Look, T.J. got hassled
by security at Hunts Point last night.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.487
What?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.961
He's-- He's fine.
I talked to him about it when we got home.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.201
Wait, wait. What do you--
What do you mean?

32:37.280 --> 32:38.805
What happened? What did you say?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.811
I told him how to handle the cops
when he gets harassed for--

32:41.880 --> 32:43.609
I don't know-- existing while black.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.006
You gave him "The Talk"?

32:45.480 --> 32:48.051
- Yeah, I talked to him.
- No, no, "The Talk."

32:48.480 --> 32:50.403
The one that parents have
with their black sons

32:50.480 --> 32:52.403
to prepare them to be treated
like criminals.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.522
I don't know, man. I just--
I just told him to be smart.

Jesus, Dion!
Look, who the <i>hell</i> are you

32:58.160 --> 32:59.924
to have <i>that</i> conversation
with my kid?

- Look, I just said--
- He's my son, and Rie's.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.884
And I think she knew
a lot better than you

33:04.000 --> 33:05.525
about the reality of being black.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.690
You crossed a line, man.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.844
Guess what.
The inspection's all set.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.161
Great.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.805
Great.

My, uh, sister has a brain bleed,

33:18.160 --> 33:19.685

That's good. That's good.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.405
If somebody's in your way,
you knock them down.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.444
Who do you hate?
What are you gonna do about it?

33:47.520 --> 33:48.965
You're gonna beat him
to a bloody pulp.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.850
Come on. Come on.
Use the left. Use the left!

33:52.040 --> 33:54.281
That's it. That's it.
[clears throat]

33:54.640 --> 33:55.846
[mid-tempo music plays]

33:58.680 --> 34:00.603
Keep working, kid.
You're doing good.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.161
[exhales]

34:23.199 --> 34:24.610
What are you looking at?

34:26.840 --> 34:27.887
Oh.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.485
You like that?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.966
Here. Hold it.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.560
- Have a great night, Dion.
- Yeah.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.926
You have fun.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.044
[Dion] Hey, you know,
I got to confess that...

35:17.120 --> 35:19.088
that marinade's kind of
growing on me.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.685
Hey, don't tell anyone I said that.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.168
Okay, Patras, what's the deal here?

35:23.240 --> 35:24.685
Why--
why the sudden turnaround?

35:24.760 --> 35:26.125
It's kind of giving me
the creeps here.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.247
[chuckles]
No, man.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.851
You know what? I-- I just realized,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.127
you know, a couple of months ago,
I was in prison.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.168
And while everyone else
was being miserable,

35:33.240 --> 35:34.685
I was actually kind of happy.
You know why?

35:34.760 --> 35:35.807
Why's that?

35:35.920 --> 35:37.570
Well, they let me cook.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.851
You know,
so if I could be happy there,

35:39.920 --> 35:41.285
I mean-- come on--
what am I--

35:41.360 --> 35:44.443
What am I doing complaining
about this gig, huh?

35:45.280 --> 35:47.203
I'm still cooking. Right?

35:50.160 --> 35:53.607
The bottom line
is you and I both want the same thing.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.768
We want this restaurant
to succeed.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.369
That's what
I'm talking about.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.211
Okay. All right, then.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.321
[mid-tempo music plays]

36:10.360 --> 36:11.600
You all right?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.285
I know you said you were okay

36:21.360 --> 36:24.648
about what happened
at Hunts Point last night, but...

36:25.520 --> 36:27.284
it's all right not to be okay.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.528
You know,
your mom and I struggled with this, too,

36:29.600 --> 36:33.400
about, [sighs]
about what to say to you,

36:34.320 --> 36:36.448
if we should say anything.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.407
What she wanted you to know--
[chuckles]

36:42.440 --> 36:44.920
She wanted you to know
you could be anything.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.204
You could do anything.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.445
You don't have to change

36:50.280 --> 36:53.648
or act any different than you want to.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.610
You have every right to be

36:55.680 --> 36:58.650
the beautiful,
talented young man you are.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.681
Okay?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.851
All right.

37:04.920 --> 37:05.967
[chuckles]

37:07.280 --> 37:08.327
Love you.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.409
[slow music plays]

37:18.400 --> 37:20.971
- [grunts]
- All right.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.769
- Aah!
- Okay, I'll tell you.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.245
The secret is paprika.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.730
That's the secret to your sauce?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.242
Even more boring than I thought.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.322
- Oh, eat me.
- Mm.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.730
Not even with your secret sauce.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.241
[both laugh]

37:39.360 --> 37:40.725
Yo, can we get two more?

37:41.680 --> 37:43.284
Uh, I got to get up at 5:00.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.728
Got-- Got to get those
salmon filets, so...

37:46.200 --> 37:47.964
Some life we have
for ourselves, huh?

37:48.200 --> 37:51.329
Yeah.
Hot, cramped kitchens, 17-hour days.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.043
Oh, the only perk is all the, uh--

37:54.120 --> 37:56.487
- all the trim we get.
- Oh, yeah?

37:57.120 --> 37:58.645
Lucky you.
It's good to be young.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.964
I haven't been laid in like a year.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.964
What?
Well, no wonder you're such a dick.

38:04.960 --> 38:09.443
[both laugh]
No, seriously, man,

38:09.520 --> 38:11.522
you got-- you got to get
your priorities straight.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.171
Look, check out this little tasty
I banged last night.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.930
- You got pictures?
- Yeah, you want to see?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.001
Oh, yeah.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.565
Mm, really?

38:21.640 --> 38:22.766
Look at those legs, huh?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.171
- Yeah.
- Oh, we're going up.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.603
Oh, man. Go, go, go.
Oh, you're killing me.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.405
Come on.
Look at those tits.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.807
- [Kevin] Nice tits. Perfect tits.
- [Dion] Perfect.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.087
You think the, uh-- the body's hot?

38:35.400 --> 38:38.165
- Want to see the face?
- Yeah, show me the face.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.081
That's my daughter!

38:41.200 --> 38:43.009
Oh, that's gonna get confusing.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.049
She calls me "daddy," too.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.848
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, pal.
- Mind your business!

38:53.200 --> 38:55.965
You just hit a cop. NYPD!

38:57.240 --> 38:58.321
Excessive?

38:59.440 --> 39:00.487
Well, appropriate.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.807
There's your quid.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.363
You owe me pro quo big time.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.807
[COP] Let's go.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.045
- [Con] Let's go.
- [Kevin] Ow!

39:08.600 --> 39:10.204
[knock on door]

39:15.040 --> 39:18.362
You see?
Necessity is the mother of invention.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.568
Listen, man,
I can't keep paying this much.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.530
[cellphone ringing]

39:25.400 --> 39:26.447
- Hello?
- [Pilar] <i>Hi.</i>

39:27.000 --> 39:29.571
They just left.
The inspection was a breeze.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.405
I can't believe I was such a stress ball.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.370
So, it all worked out.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.010
<i>[Pilar] Yes. Thank you so much.</i>

39:37.200 --> 39:38.645
Well, glad I could be of help.

[mid-tempo music plays]

39:48.640 --> 39:50.483
God, you look good in this light.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.851
Thanks, I mean, I wish I could-- I wish
I could say the same.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.922
[laughs]
Listen, man, look.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.924
The boys are back, huh?
Feels good.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.929
And this, God damn it...

40:03.600 --> 40:04.806
this has got to go.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.642
White is definitely not right.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.087
Boom.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.566
- [Tommy] Feels good.
- Yeah, it feels great.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.530
You know what would make me
feel even better?

40:18.600 --> 40:21.410

40:21.560 --> 40:24.450

40:27.480 --> 40:29.050
Ohh! That was close.

So, wait, so, all that sucking up,

40:31.680 --> 40:34.251
all that "Yes, Chef". That was all a con.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.884
And you banged his daughter
just to piss him off?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.327
Well, you know,
I took one for the team.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.602
What about the bar?
What if there wasn't a cop there?

40:42.680 --> 40:44.967
The good news/bad news
is I attract cops.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.088
And tonight, you know,
it was good news.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.127
Watch this.
[laughs]

40:51.360 --> 40:52.805
- Bam!
- Aah!

Hey.

That talk you had with T.J...

Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.606
It's my job.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.687
You're the cool uncle. I'm the dad.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.603
Trust me,
I don't want to be the dad.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.642
[Marisa] Damn it.

Damn. Damn it.

Damn it!

[Habib] Order up, T.J.

- Here's to it.
- To you, chef.

To you.

Hey, yo, yo, T-Bone!
What's up, man?

You got the goods?

41:46.960 --> 41:48.246
Get some of this, huh?

41:50.240 --> 41:52.163
Mmm! Oh, now, that...

41:52.440 --> 41:54.249
that is good food, I'm telling you.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.961
[Dion] You try some of this?

Got to get a piece
of everything here,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.446
even some of the herbs.
It's all important. It's all flavor.

[Dion] Take a piece of that with
the beets right there--

42:04.160 --> 42:06.322

when you mix the flavors.
