WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:09.342
all: * Strong ladies
with boundaries *

00:09.384 --> 00:11.177
* Better treat us well *

00:11.219 --> 00:13.221
[upbeat music]

00:13.263 --> 00:16.933
* Are we bitches or do we
just respect ourselves? *

00:16.975 --> 00:18.018
- We sound amazing.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.144
all: * Hard to tell *

00:19.185 --> 00:21.062
[all cheering]

00:21.104 --> 00:23.189
- [screams]
Are we really done?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.649
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.110
This is the first thing
I've ever finished in my life.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.654
- This album covers everything.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.406
Love, betrayal,

00:31.448 --> 00:32.949
that one we threw in
at the 1-yard line

00:32.991 --> 00:34.159
about your knee 'sploding.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.994
- Yeah.
- "Bend Not Break" is probably

00:36.036 --> 00:37.787
the only song
about arthroplasty

00:37.829 --> 00:39.581
you can slam ham to.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.291
- 16 songs!

00:41.332 --> 00:43.793
We did it all on our own terms.
No skips.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.587
There's not one filler track
this time.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.340
- [laughs] Whoo!
- Girls5eva!

00:48.381 --> 00:50.508
You ready, girls?
- Heck yeah, I'm ready.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.345
- You know I'm ready.
- [giggles] Me too.

00:53.386 --> 00:57.098
- I was born ready.
- Then let's do this.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.808
And sound off if you're ready.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.185
Wickie?
- Ready!

01:00.226 --> 01:01.728
- Summer?
- Also ready.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.605
- Glo?
- Still ready.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.732
- Dawn?
- In the house.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.859
- Actually, if you're ready,
can you say ready?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.070
Because you could be
in the house and not ready.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.905
[record scratch]

01:11.946 --> 01:13.365
- Whoo-hoo!
Come and get it.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.616
- Oh, my gosh.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.117
- To Dawn,

01:16.159 --> 01:17.285
for being
our intrepid songwriter

01:17.327 --> 01:19.204
and sometimes soloist.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.791
To Gloria,
for overcoming and inspiring.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.000
To Summer--

01:24.042 --> 01:25.502
I haven't really been
keeping up with you.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.630
For...not marrying
your parents?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.465
- That's not really
a bad summary.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.884
- And to me,
for being a team player,

01:32.926 --> 01:36.096
perhaps the best team player.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.305
- Don't forget Ray.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.473
- Ray.
- Aww.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.808
- Aww, it's been an honor.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.643
- Ray.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.229
We will forever see you
as the incomparable producer

01:44.270 --> 01:46.731
we worked with
before Jack Antonoff.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.108
- That means a lot.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.819
- [chuckles]
- To Girls5eva!

01:50.860 --> 01:52.946
[all cheering]

01:52.987 --> 01:54.572
[groans]
- What is that?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.908
- It's Brown Mountain K-Cup
Sparkling Champ-Brown.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.034
Don't drink it!

01:58.076 --> 02:00.120
It's just for holding up.
Just hold it up.

02:00.161 --> 02:03.790
[upbeat pop music]
all: * Gonna be famous 5eva *

02:03.832 --> 02:06.167
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

02:06.209 --> 02:07.711
* It's too short *

02:07.752 --> 02:10.672
* Gonna be famous 3gether *

02:10.714 --> 02:14.384
* 'Cause that's 1 more
than 2gether *

02:14.426 --> 02:17.512
* Gonna be famous 5eva *

02:17.554 --> 02:20.515
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

02:20.557 --> 02:23.226
* So what are you waiting 5? *

02:23.268 --> 02:27.397
* Girls5eva *

02:27.439 --> 02:29.524
[twinkling note]

02:29.566 --> 02:31.526
all: * BPE *
- Oh!

02:31.568 --> 02:34.529
all: * Got that
Big Pussy Energy *

02:34.571 --> 02:35.697
both: * Yeah, yeah, yeah *

02:35.739 --> 02:36.781
- "Yeah, yeah."
That's what I added.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.158
- [laughs]

02:38.199 --> 02:41.578
I really feel like
"BPE" puts our best P forward.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.204
- It's bold.
- Yeah.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.456
- It's fresh. It's--

02:44.497 --> 02:45.749
[cheering on TV]
- Fake!

02:45.790 --> 02:47.125
- It is not fake.
These are athletes.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.626
- Ugh!

02:48.668 --> 02:50.545
- Couldn't you and da fellas
take it to a Pep Boys?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.881
We're selecting our single.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.592
- Jake Paul is taking on
a newly buff Kumail Nanjiani.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.218
This is my Super Bowl.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.137
- Kumail has been jacked
for years.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.764
It's not news anymore.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.891
- God, how could I possibly
have a hangover

03:02.932 --> 03:05.352
from barely sipping
one Champ-Brown?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.355
- Are you pregnant?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.689
It was Scott's birthday
last month.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.232
I know you didn't
have time to shop.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.567
- No.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.904
No, and I took three tests
just in case.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.073
No, I don't--I don't know
what's going on with me.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.368
Yesterday, I passed out
for three hours and--and--

03:21.409 --> 03:24.162
I sweat through a book.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.414
- It's post-album mode
adrenaline leaving your body.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.084
Don't Sicilian spiral.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.293
- Yeah, probably.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.545
all: * Why don't we bend *

03:32.587 --> 03:34.923
* So we don't break? *

03:34.964 --> 03:37.467
* Why don't we
lean on each other *

03:37.509 --> 03:39.719
* To carry the weight *

03:39.761 --> 03:42.931
- This. This is your single.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.224
- Excuse me?

03:44.265 --> 03:45.725
- Yeah, I could work out
to this.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.519
Makes me want to do squats

03:47.560 --> 03:49.187
'cause it's got the word
"bend" in it.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.106
- * I could feel
the pressure on me *

03:51.147 --> 03:53.775
- Sheawn.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.777
- Hi, Sheawn.
- Sheawn and I work together

03:55.819 --> 03:57.362
at P.S. I Love You
Middle School.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.447
- I'm a lunch lord.
- A what?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.282
- A lunch lord.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.410
It's the masculine
of lunch lady.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.161
- I assure you, it is not.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.955
We're going with "B.P.E."

04:06.996 --> 04:09.874
Thanks for the offput.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.419
- You're funny.
I like you.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.295
- Everyone likes me.
Don't make a meal of it.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.464
- Well, that's just what I do.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.299
Get it? Lunch lord humor?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.844
- [laughs]

04:20.885 --> 04:22.220
[quirky music]

04:22.262 --> 04:23.513
- How 'bout I make you dinner?

04:23.555 --> 04:25.306
- Dawn, please spit take
on my behalf.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.183
- [spits]

04:27.225 --> 04:29.269
How did I do that?
I'm not drinking anything.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.437
[sighs]

04:30.478 --> 04:32.313
- You didn't answer
my question.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.982
Can I make you dinner?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.984
- What? Oh, I'm sorry.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.819
I'm getting a call
in the other room.

04:39.029 --> 04:39.988
[phone clatters]

04:40.030 --> 04:41.448
Coming!

04:43.366 --> 04:45.035
[whispering]
Oh, my God.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.370
- Okay.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.748
[sentimental music]

04:49.789 --> 04:51.416
- Mmm.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.585
Ohh, album is done.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.378
How do you wanna celebrate?
- I have some ideas.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.546
- Okay.

04:56.588 --> 05:00.216
[dog barking]

05:00.258 --> 05:01.843
- Scully, hush!

05:01.885 --> 05:03.553
Shh! Scully!

05:04.220 --> 05:07.015
[barking]

05:07.057 --> 05:08.016
Scully!

05:10.560 --> 05:12.979
- Where's the $3
that was in my robe pocket?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.690
- I didn't touch your robe,
Mr. McManus.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.233
- Oh, it was in there
yesterday.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.986
And today, you're strutting
around with a new soda.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.238
- Dad, Rita didn't take
your money!

05:22.280 --> 05:24.824
Rita, put on an "Airwolf"!

05:24.866 --> 05:26.493
["Airwolf" theme playing]
[sighs]

05:26.534 --> 05:28.703
[jackhammer pounding]

05:28.745 --> 05:30.455
- Is that night construction?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.458
- No, my damn parrot
can mimic roadwork.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.751
- That's lunch, boys.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.544
You coming to Sbarro, Tom?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.421
Nah, Nancy packed me tuna.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.256
[jackhammering resumes]
- This isn't hot.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
[dog barking]

05:41.800 --> 05:43.009
- Just tune it out.
- I should just go.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.386
- Hey, hey, wait!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.054
What if...

05:46.096 --> 05:47.389
The bitch is in the bank.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.682
We're getting a place together.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.808
- Over my dead body.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.518
Sorry, I just love a hot take.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.560
Supporting you.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.854
- Oh, you have to use Kev.

05:54.896 --> 05:55.855
- As what?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.066
- Realty is
his new side hustle.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.485
It's the perfect job
for former boy band members

06:00.527 --> 06:01.903
because they're hot

06:01.945 --> 06:03.571
and they already know
how to point at things.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.907
- * If you don't want to live
where you live no more *

06:05.949 --> 06:08.410
* Just DM Kev
from the Boys Next Door *

06:08.451 --> 06:10.745
* You don't need a bank
or a credit score *

06:10.787 --> 06:13.373
* Just good vibes
or a guarantor *

06:13.415 --> 06:14.749
* *

06:14.791 --> 06:18.753
* Shweet pads with
l-l-l-l-lobby carts *

06:18.795 --> 06:21.256
* P-p-p-p-plugs *

06:21.297 --> 06:22.757
* D-d-d-d-doormen *

06:22.799 --> 06:25.343
* That stink-talk
everyone but you *

06:25.385 --> 06:28.221
* And ala-ka-poof,
living large *

06:28.263 --> 06:31.099
* On a r-r-r-roof deck *

06:31.141 --> 06:36.146
* Kev Hamlin,
Brown-Haired-Stevens Realty *

06:36.187 --> 06:38.106
License pending.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.316
- Right.
- Please.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.818
He's living in my basement.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.904
I need him to do something.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.033
- Eh, I do like
a stink-talking doorman.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.451
Sure. Set it up.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.369
- Yes!
- Knock, knock!

06:51.411 --> 06:53.246
[chuckles] Hi.
Knocking verbally.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.790
I can't make a fist
due to a knuckle skin tuck.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.667
- Who'd you go to?
- Honestly, I don't know.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.129
I just popped in to say,
your album is a-mah-zing.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.631
And I'm almost done
with a killer marketing deck

07:03.673 --> 07:04.924
that I can't wait to show you.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.468
- Oh, my God, is it
PowerPoint or Keynote?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.094
No, surprise us.
- Will do.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.305
Also, a reminder
to amp up socials

07:10.347 --> 07:11.806
as we approach drop day.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.142
- Look, I lost followers
due to a volcano explosion

07:14.184 --> 07:15.143
in Saint-Tropez,

07:15.185 --> 07:16.644
[whispers]
not from a bot purge.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.688
- So Tate, we were
talking about our single.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.814
- It's "B.P.E."

07:19.856 --> 07:21.983
- Obviously,
I heart that track.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.365
You can't tell, but I'm trying
to make a hand heart.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.159
But actually, our algos, data,
and 'puters came back

07:31.201 --> 07:33.036
with "Bend Not Break"
as your single.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.871
- The one about my knee?
- Yeah.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.040
Focus groups of normals said
it made them wanna squat.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.542
See ya, wouldwanna be ya.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.086
- [gasps]
- Peace out.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.254
One second.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.673
- Aww.
- [laughs]

07:44.714 --> 07:47.467
- That kitchen basic was right.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.053
Maybe he could be useful.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.971
- Oh, wait--
um, I was looking something up.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.765
- "White diarrhea"?
Jesus, Dawn.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.100
- I told you.
Something's up with me.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.977
- Scott, put me through
to the lunch lord.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.526
- Glad you changed your mind.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.819
Hope you like sloppy joes.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.238
- I don't. And why so many?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.031
- I'm a lunch lord, Wickie.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.783
That's the only way
I know how to cook.

08:11.825 --> 08:16.413
I also made 40 pounds
of wet corn.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.374
- But can't you just
divide the recipe?

08:19.416 --> 08:21.418
- Huh?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.087
- [giggles]

08:24.129 --> 08:27.966
- So where you from?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.801
- The white part of Maryland.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.471
You know, that song you liked

08:33.513 --> 08:35.974
was validated by focus groups
and computers.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.809
- Yeah, I'm smart.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.144
- Right, right.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.687
I'm debating how to
caption this photo.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.607
What do you think of,
"So full from eating," #food?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.694
Or, "Still pondering the loss
of the Lion of the Senate,

08:47.736 --> 08:52.615
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
#SupportTheTroops, #BodyGoPow."

08:52.657 --> 08:55.076
- Mm-mm. Hate 'em both.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.578
Why don't you just be honest?

08:56.619 --> 08:59.706
Say, "Tell me how cute
I am, and it will

08:59.748 --> 09:01.332
temporarily make me feel good."

09:01.374 --> 09:04.252
- So simple.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.004
Honesty.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.213
As always, I'm doing too much.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.507
- Or just say,
"Is a hot dog a sandwich?"

09:09.549 --> 09:12.093
And people go nuts
debating about it.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.971
Well, I mean, in my school,
it's a vegetable, but--

09:15.013 --> 09:18.850
- Wow, you're like if
Anaheim was a person.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.686
- Well, you ain't gotta
sweet talk me, I'm right here.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.063
- Oh, I'm stuffed.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.481
This was fun.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.316
- Neither is true.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.443
You know, you lie a lot.
- What?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.986
- You lie a lot.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.112
- No, I just--

09:31.154 --> 09:33.531
I'm still out of sorts about

09:33.573 --> 09:36.076
Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
assassination.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.536
Will they ever catch him?

[upbeat music]

09:41.581 --> 09:43.041

09:43.083 --> 09:46.169
- For your budge,
this apart is a barg.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.713
- It's so quiet.
- [laughs]

09:48.755 --> 09:51.549
- They're on the hook.
Do your Kev-surements.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.719
- Uh, the living room
is five shimmy shimmy pops

09:54.761 --> 09:56.596
by seven body rolls.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.893
Ah, as a celebrity realtor,
people really expect...

10:01.935 --> 10:03.728
* All that jazz *

10:03.770 --> 10:06.523
It's not the original tune,
so I don't have to pay anyone.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.818
- Hey, does this place
have a bathtub?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.027
- That is a great question.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.570
I love that question.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.322
Um, the answer is...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.409
I don't know.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.369
I saw a picture,
and I brought you here,

10:19.411 --> 10:21.788
and--and all I know
is what you know.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.833
I don't--I-I'm not even sure
where we are right now.

10:24.874 --> 10:29.629
- Hey, why don't you and I
go find the bathroom?

10:29.671 --> 10:30.505
- Good call, babe.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.590
- Ex-babe.
- Ex-babe. Hah.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.759
So do we have a deal?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.302
- Oh, well, we'll see.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.472
I'm curious what your
Kev-surements are in feet.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.849
- [laughs]
- So I'll check that out.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.518
- Sure. Oh, whoopsie.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.645
Huh. Who's June?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.065
- Gloria, I took
the liberty of putting

10:49.107 --> 10:50.400
my number in your phone.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.945
- * Wanting, yearning *

10:53.987 --> 10:58.116
* Remembering sexual *

10:59.743 --> 11:01.411
- June is Gay Pride Month.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.538
- What's that phone number?
- Ah, nah, kid. [chuckles]

11:03.580 --> 11:05.623
These are my go-to
Powerball numbers.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.417
- Mm, no, the Powerball
is five numbers

11:07.459 --> 11:09.127
plus one for the Powerball.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.128
I know because
all my life plans

11:10.170 --> 11:12.756
hinged on winning the lottery.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.758
I saw your face, Gloria.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.801
I've seen that face on my face.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.428
You're having sneaky thoughts.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.763
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.766
- As your realtor,
it's my job to get real.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.018
You're having doubts
about your relationship.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.854
Buyer's remorse?
- What? No!

11:27.896 --> 11:32.484
I've been working so hard
to get my ex-wife back.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.029
I love her, and I am not
pretending to be happy.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.657
- That's a direct quote
from my wedding vows.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.076
All right, if you're
sticking with the story,

11:41.117 --> 11:42.452
a little advice:

11:42.494 --> 11:44.913
throw yourself
into an impenetrable hobby,

11:44.954 --> 11:48.500
something so all-encompassing
that no unwanted thought

11:48.541 --> 11:50.043
could sneak in
through your brain door.

11:50.085 --> 11:54.589
What about posing taxidermy
in historical iconic moments--

11:54.631 --> 11:57.676
the Moon landing, Lewis and
Clark with little raccoons?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.260
- Thanks, Kev.
Doesn't apply to me.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.013
- It's got a working bathtub!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.765
- Cool, babe.
Let's think about it.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.392
- Or if you don't
wanna think about it,

12:05.433 --> 12:07.143
you could always do the
thing that I just said.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.311
Wink.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.021
- Thanks, Kev. Bye, Kev.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.816
- What did you do?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.776
- My tongue is weirdly hot,

12:14.818 --> 12:18.405
and I have too much saliva
and brain fog.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.073
And I have brain fog.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.368
I'm not a doctor,
but I am 99% sure

12:23.410 --> 12:25.704
I have Flynn Stranbygaard
Syndrome.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.164
- Well, the only way
to test for that

12:28.206 --> 12:30.417
is to sample the brain
after death.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.961
And have you been
near a Chilean spider?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.296
- No, but I live by a place

12:35.338 --> 12:37.382
that makes
very authentic empanadas.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.883
- Are you drinking
enough water?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.093
Are you stressed
about something?

12:40.135 --> 12:41.761
- This is so typical!

12:41.803 --> 12:43.555
The medical community
just ignoring

12:43.596 --> 12:46.391
a woman's symptoms
when diagnostic tests

12:46.433 --> 12:49.561
would obviously prove--
- Dawn, this is your file.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.273
I mean, you've had
a dozen MRIs.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.941
Last year, you thought you had
one of those

12:54.983 --> 12:56.359
black licorice heart attacks.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.694
- Because I ate
so much licorice.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.779
- You thought you were dying
because a stray cat

12:59.821 --> 13:01.114
kept following you.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.199
- Because at a nursing home,
there's always a cat

13:03.241 --> 13:05.452
who knows who's next.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.329
Look, I was wrong about those.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.750
If I'm the boy who cried wolf,
this is probably the end.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.918
And the wolf is here.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.172
- All right, if I draw
some blood, will you--

13:17.213 --> 13:19.257
and I'm asking as your doctor--

13:19.299 --> 13:22.594
get the fuck out of here?

13:22.635 --> 13:23.678
- I will.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.140
- Hi, Tate.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.350
- Oh, gah!

13:28.391 --> 13:29.934
Sorry, I ran late
talking to Co-Z Boi.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.269
- My fault, ladies.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.104
I'm so chill,
people don't notice

13:33.146 --> 13:35.273
the passage of time around me.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.984
It's bad 'cause
my dad's diabetic.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.488
Well, was.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.281
- It must have been his time.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.282
- Okay, come on, come on,
come on.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.007
Everything's digital now,
but I wanted you

14:01.049 --> 14:02.384
to have something to hold.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.302
- With a screener
for "Being the Ricardos"?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.428
- It's just in there
for weight.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.348
- Oh.
- Oh, okay, okay. All right.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.350
- You put in the hard work,
now it's our turn.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.726
- Okay.
- You're familiar with

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
"The Late Late Show
with James Corden"?

14:13.395 --> 14:15.188
- Of course!
- Obviously.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.982
- Well, if during a commercial
you wanted to check the news,

14:18.024 --> 14:22.028
you might find yourself at a
site called wuzappening.com.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.279
- Yes.
- And if you checked out

14:23.321 --> 14:29.828
the Lifestyle section,
and scrolled--lled

14:29.869 --> 14:31.538
to the bottom of the page,
you would see

14:31.579 --> 14:33.081
what looks like a legitimate
news story called

14:33.123 --> 14:35.166
"You Won't Believe
What Joe Biden's First Crush

of an absolute raisin on it.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.088
- What does that have
to do with Corden?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.339
- Once you open the link--

14:41.381 --> 14:43.091
I can't legally say
it isn't malware,

- Won't that make people mad?
- That's the point.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.444
Our brains are wired
to store memories

15:02.485 --> 15:04.320
made during moments
of extreme emotion,

15:04.362 --> 15:05.864
like anger or panic.

And that's how you create
an earworm.

Right?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.789
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

15:14.831 --> 15:19.210
- No music video, no promoted
tweets, no Carpool Karaoke.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.427
- And why can't I swallow?

15:27.469 --> 15:29.387
- It's probably because
the album's dropping.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.598
And you wrote all
of the songs on it,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.684

it means that they hate you

Oh, no, honey,
I'm so on your side.

that you let us all down

a third chance

I don't wanna bore you.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.801
- Cool.
So you wanna talk about

17:31.843 --> 17:33.261
whether Jake Paul
is a real fighter or not?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.138
- It's just the label's
not pushing our album,

17:35.180 --> 17:37.307
and we need to do something
big to get noticed.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.685
And I keep asking myself,

17:40.727 --> 17:45.023
what would a regular brained
normal like?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.983
You know, what would
get on their radar?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.568
[machine rumbling]

17:48.610 --> 17:50.195
- The Nuggetter's
working through a beak.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.529
- Oh.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.950
- [grunting]

17:55.992 --> 17:59.079
[machine quiets]

17:59.120 --> 18:01.122
I'm actually kind of
surprised that you wanted

18:01.164 --> 18:02.207
to hang out with me again.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.541
- Why?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.378
I love it here!
[machine rumbling]

18:06.419 --> 18:08.755
Allow me.
[laughs]

18:11.675 --> 18:13.885
[both laughing]

18:13.927 --> 18:16.471
- That's--that's--
that's good, that's good.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.601
You know, it's just that every
question that you asked me

18:21.643 --> 18:24.104
was about you.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.647
- Are you suggesting
that I'm self-centered?

18:25.689 --> 18:27.107
I'm not. I'm very giving.

18:27.148 --> 18:31.069
I go to multiple
charity cocktail hours

18:31.111 --> 18:34.155
to raise awareness
for the uglies

18:34.197 --> 18:38.535
and the sads and the
misshapen and the ruined.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.620
- Mm-hmm.

18:40.662 --> 18:44.457
And do you also raise...money?

18:44.499 --> 18:47.002
- Fine.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.045
I just like going
to really cool parties.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.256
Half the time, I don't
even know what they're for.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.924
Like, I was at this one
for renal failure,

18:52.966 --> 18:55.176
and I was like,
why am I even here?

18:55.218 --> 18:56.970
I don't even have a renus.

18:57.012 --> 19:00.515
- Okay,
glad we're being honest.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.475
So can I be honest?

19:05.895 --> 19:09.315
You got a little bit
of beak on your cheek.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.610
[machine rumbling]

19:14.779 --> 19:18.074
[romantic music]

19:18.116 --> 19:19.826
- This feels good.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.122
- Hey, guys.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.207
Hey, I'm-I'm trying
to lower my anxiety

19:26.249 --> 19:28.918
by listening to a white lady
who went to India once.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.629
- We were just trying to see
what kind of couch we want.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.089
This one's nice.
- Yeah.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.674
- Some good bounce.
- Yeah.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.594
Can you believe this bitch
is back in the bank?

19:39.262 --> 19:40.680
Go ahead, tell me
who you've been with.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.140
I can handle it.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.601
- Well, you'll be
happy to know, no one.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.769
- Really, no one?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.687
- I had a low point
where I purchased

19:47.729 --> 19:49.272
a Megan Rapinoe torso.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.608
But due to, you know,
supply chain issues,

19:51.649 --> 19:52.776
that one didn't show up.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.986
- Well, I've dated around.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.529
Don't worry,
you're not missing anything.

19:56.571 --> 19:59.282
I mean, yeah, it's fun
at first, but I'm

19:59.324 --> 20:02.118
so sick of three-month stands.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.246
Now I just kind of wanna watch
Criterion Collection

20:05.288 --> 20:07.123
until I die, you know?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.334
- Yeah, same, girl. Same!

20:09.376 --> 20:11.294
Not missing anything.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.254
Let's see how this couch
handles a little...

20:13.296 --> 20:15.507
* All that jazz *

20:15.548 --> 20:17.967
[upbeat music]

20:18.009 --> 20:21.096
- Gloria, feed me like a horse.

20:21.137 --> 20:25.183
- * More thoughts, uh-oh *

20:25.225 --> 20:29.020
* Should I have dated
more ladies? *

20:29.062 --> 20:34.609
[horse whinnies]
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

20:36.736 --> 20:38.655
- The basic gave it up.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.615
All I had to do
was nugget a chicken.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.450
- Stop juicing the lunch lord.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.910
What did he say?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.203
- He just started watching
the Beatles documentary

20:45.245 --> 20:46.663
and thinks we should
do the roof thing

20:46.705 --> 20:48.039
from the Beatles documentary.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.916
I said it's been
done a million times.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.502
He said, "So? And can we please
stop talking about work?"

20:52.544 --> 20:53.837
I said, "Yes," and left.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.463
We need a roof!

20:55.505 --> 20:57.716
- I know where
we can get a roof.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.887
- Okay, we live, y'all!
- Whoo!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.848
- You've been waiting
an eternity for us

21:04.889 --> 21:07.851
to make "Returnity."

21:07.892 --> 21:10.145
This is "Bend Not Break."

21:10.186 --> 21:12.480
- * I could feel
the pressure on me *

21:12.522 --> 21:14.816
- * From every direction
on me *

21:14.858 --> 21:19.487
all: * Every time we learn the
rules, you change the game *

21:19.529 --> 21:22.323
- * But we learned
our lesson already *

21:22.365 --> 21:24.951
- * Got our
secret weapon all ready *

21:24.993 --> 21:29.664
all: * And it's got eight legs,
four smiles, and a cane *

21:29.706 --> 21:34.419
* Why don't we bend
so we don't break? *

21:34.461 --> 21:36.755
* Why don't we lean
on each other *

21:36.796 --> 21:39.549
- Oh, I think it's wonderful
what they're doing up there.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.926
What are they doing up there?
- Clear the way!

21:41.968 --> 21:43.345
Clear the way!

21:43.386 --> 21:44.971
I'm so late
for this Halloween party!

21:45.013 --> 21:46.056
It's the spring!

21:46.097 --> 21:48.516
all: * So we don't break *

21:48.558 --> 21:53.355
* Why don't we bend
so we don't break? *

21:53.396 --> 21:58.276
* Why don't we lean on each
other to carry the weight? *

21:58.318 --> 22:00.028
- Oh!
- That's a chopper, y'all!

22:00.070 --> 22:01.654
- What the fuck? Ahh!
- Oh, my God!

22:01.696 --> 22:04.699
- Are they trying to come here?
- That's a lot of wind, ex-babe!

22:04.741 --> 22:06.159
[screaming]

22:06.201 --> 22:08.995
- I knew the H didn't stand
for hospitality deck!

22:09.037 --> 22:10.663
- I make no secret!

22:10.705 --> 22:12.957
I'm license pending!

22:12.999 --> 22:15.210
- It took my extensions!

22:15.251 --> 22:19.172
Whose idea was this? Ahh!

22:19.214 --> 22:21.758
- Damn you, lunch lord!

22:21.800 --> 22:24.344
- We can't land!

22:24.386 --> 22:26.513
Take that to the taint ward!

22:26.554 --> 22:28.848
- What? Oh, my God!

22:28.890 --> 22:31.893
- You have nine minutes!
- Okay!

22:31.935 --> 22:33.269
- Go! Go!

22:36.564 --> 22:40.068
- I can't believe I took career
advice from a lunch lord.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.070
You're not an oracle of basics.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.906
You're just basic.

22:44.948 --> 22:48.410
- So why are you here?

22:48.451 --> 22:52.706
- To yell at you and let you
know your ideas are bad.

22:52.747 --> 22:56.376
- Well, if you're just
telling me I suck,

22:56.418 --> 22:58.795
sounds like it could have been
a email.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.464
- [scoffs]
Typing?

23:01.506 --> 23:04.259
As mad as I am?

23:04.300 --> 23:07.470
I wouldn't waste
this manicure on you.

23:07.512 --> 23:12.767
Also, screen time
interrupts sleep cycles.

23:12.809 --> 23:13.977
So.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.565
[light music]

23:18.606 --> 23:23.319
* *

23:23.361 --> 23:26.614
[dramatic romantic music]

23:26.656 --> 23:28.408
* *

23:28.450 --> 23:29.951
Mm!

23:29.993 --> 23:31.953
Why do I like you?

23:31.995 --> 23:33.705
- And sign here,
sign here, sign here,

23:33.747 --> 23:34.873
sign here, and sign there.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.292
- You have to point
at different places.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.668
- It only requires
one signature.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.420
I'm doing emphasis.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.713
- This is really happening.

23:41.755 --> 23:42.797
- We're home, babe.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.091
- Aww.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.634
* Well-- *

23:46.676 --> 23:49.804
- If you are about to sing
"The Jeffersons" theme, don't.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.056
- I wasn't.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.223
- I'm gonna show you
the bathtub.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.351
- All right, let's--
- [gasps] The bath!

23:54.392 --> 23:56.311
- Yes! Yes!
- Uh!

23:56.353 --> 23:59.647
You closed your
first deal, ex-babe.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.316
Maybe you can use some
of the money to, like,

24:01.358 --> 24:02.817
move out of the basement.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.362
- No, I'm putting it all back
into the biz, ex-babe.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.114
I already spent the whole thing
on Gucci no-show socks.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.532
- What?

24:09.574 --> 24:11.951
Well, how will anyone
even know?

24:11.993 --> 24:14.371
- I know. I know.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.831
It gave me the confidence to
come in here and kill it today

24:16.873 --> 24:20.835
and the swagger to walk
this back to the office.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.963
and see if any of it's right.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.840
[chuckles]

24:25.882 --> 24:29.344
Oh, Gloria, thanks so much for
being my first offish commish.

24:29.386 --> 24:33.181
- Oh, yeah, no problem.
Hey, come here.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.849
I guess you were wrong
when you thought that

24:34.891 --> 24:36.267
I was anything like you, huh?

24:36.309 --> 24:39.104
Because I got the apartment,
I'm committing.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.730
- [laughs]
Nah.

24:40.772 --> 24:43.525
This is straight out of
the Kev prey book.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.485
- What? Renting an apartment?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.987
- I bought Summer
a mother huggin' house.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.281
Because how can you have any
doubts about your relationship

24:50.323 --> 24:52.242
if you're so committed?

24:52.283 --> 24:55.995
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a housewarming gift.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.206
It's a tiny
Abraham Lincoln beard

24:58.248 --> 25:02.585
and some raccoon poison.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.837
Wink.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.882
I think you're gonna have
a lot of fun with it.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.718
- Just get the fuck--

25:09.759 --> 25:13.805
- In feel bad news, reunited
girl group Girls5eva

25:13.847 --> 25:17.058
violated several
FAA regulations attempting

25:17.100 --> 25:20.145
to be like the Beatles
from the Beatles documentary.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.105
Now, I don't like
to editorialize,

25:22.147 --> 25:23.898
so I'll just reserve
my opinions

25:23.940 --> 25:25.608
about just how basic that is.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.111
[door opens]
New data shows that every...

25:28.153 --> 25:30.155
- Where have you been?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.740
- Oh.

25:31.781 --> 25:35.160
Just out all night alone.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.661
But let's talk about you.

25:38.288 --> 25:39.914
Diarrhea still white?

25:39.956 --> 25:42.000
- I stopped checking
because I'm trying to accept

25:42.042 --> 25:43.335
the things I cannot control.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.378
[phone buzzing]

25:47.297 --> 25:49.591
- Oh, God.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.343
- Hey, Tate!
- Hey, T-bone!

25:51.384 --> 25:53.011
- Ladies, I caught the roof.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.305
Oh, wait, I'm seeing my notes,
don't mention the roof.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.599
So I did not see the roof.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.809
Anyway, we're routing
a world tour for Collab

25:59.851 --> 26:01.019
and looking for an opener.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.480
Wanted to temp check
on G5E's interest

26:03.521 --> 26:06.066
before I threw your hats
in the ring.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.777
- Uh, well, none of my hats
are meant to be thrown,

26:08.818 --> 26:11.905
but Dawn has some caps
that say Mets and so forth.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.615
- Oh, of course.
Okay, I'll throw her hat.

26:13.656 --> 26:14.908
[phone ringing]
[laughs] Okay, can't wait

26:14.949 --> 26:17.202
for this, girls,
this is big for you,

26:17.243 --> 26:18.953
big for me,
big for the Pro Bros.

26:18.995 --> 26:19.954
- Miss Solano?

26:19.996 --> 26:21.748
- Dr. Cole.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.917
Is the wolf here?
- Actually, something did

26:23.958 --> 26:25.710
come up on your blood work.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.587
You're pregnant.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.255
- What? No.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.298
No, no, no, no.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.258
I took three pregnancy t--

26:32.300 --> 26:34.886
[quirky music]

26:34.928 --> 26:36.429
Nope, they're thumb drives.

26:36.471 --> 26:39.849
I peed on thumb drives
in the dark.

26:39.891 --> 26:42.227
- We're going on tour, baby!

26:42.268 --> 26:43.478
- Oh, my...

26:45.689 --> 26:46.648
Fuck.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.276
- Oh, I'm so ready

26:50.318 --> 26:52.404
to do my roll call.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.364
You ready, Summer?
- Yeah, Dawn.

26:54.406 --> 26:56.116
- Ashley?
- Hella ready.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.992
Gloria?
- Vroom, vroom, ready!

26:58.034 --> 26:59.869
- Wickie?

26:59.911 --> 27:01.287
- I'm not ready, guys!

27:01.329 --> 27:03.832
- You were just ready.
- Sorry! Start without me!

27:03.873 --> 27:05.667
- What? We can't start this
thing without you, Wick.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.168
- No way, Wickie.
- Oh, it's not a party

27:07.210 --> 27:08.545
without Wickie,
come on, Wickie!

27:08.586 --> 27:10.296
- Okay, okay, I'm here.

27:10.338 --> 27:13.842
I'm here and 150% ready

27:13.883 --> 27:18.596
to break it down.

27:18.638 --> 27:22.350
In five, four, three,

27:22.392 --> 27:28.523
two, one, two, three, four,

27:28.565 --> 27:31.526
four, five.
- Uh, you said four twice.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.777
- [laughs]
Did I?

27:32.819 --> 27:35.447
I'm just so pumped
for this song!

27:35.488 --> 27:37.991
- It's all good, girls.
Let's fire it up.

27:38.033 --> 27:41.703
- Yeah, Dawn's ready,
Wickie's ready,

27:41.745 --> 27:45.248
Ashley's ready, Glo, ready.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.542
I'm ready.
You ready, Kayleigh?

27:47.584 --> 27:48.877
- We don't have a Kayleigh
anymore.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.503
- Remember her mom wasn't up
for all this?

27:50.545 --> 27:52.881
- Right, right.
[laughs]

27:52.922 --> 27:55.050
Girls, we have a quorum.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.676
Should we do this thang?

27:56.718 --> 27:57.886
- If you're questioning it,

27:57.927 --> 27:59.554
maybe you're not
totally ready.

27:59.596 --> 28:00.847
- You know,
I had the same thought.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.640
Maybe we meet back
the same time tomorrow

28:02.682 --> 28:04.476
when it's a certainty
that we're all ready.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.269
- I can't, but I'm good
the day after.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.938
- Works for me. [laughs]
- Same, dog.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.900
- Then it's settled.
The day after tomorrow, y'all!

28:11.941 --> 28:13.902
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.862
[eating biscuits]
