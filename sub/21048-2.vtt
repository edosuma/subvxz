00:19.864 --> 00:21.478
The explosion.

00:21.598 --> 00:24.377
Somebody did it to us.
Someone very close.

00:26.064 --> 00:29.447
Does the name Jakob Negrescu
mean anything to you?

00:33.057 --> 00:35.196
So he kept secrets, even from you.

00:35.316 --> 00:38.528
I think I missing something.
I think you missing everything.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.120
You...

00:58.240 --> 01:00.480
... broke my heart.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.160
Adam?

01:06.240 --> 01:09.360
Georgina?
What the hell are you doing here?

01:09.480 --> 01:11.960
You know,
really I could ask you the same thing.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.279
How did you...?

01:14.849 --> 01:16.279
Irina told me.

01:16.399 --> 01:18.168
I suppose it's good that you and

01:18.288 --> 01:20.113
Mum are on first name terms now.

01:20.991 --> 01:22.865
What are you doing with that?

01:22.985 --> 01:25.052
I thought you were someone else.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.320
What is this place?

01:30.012 --> 01:31.839
Dad's little illusion.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.440
The tax people seem to think

01:34.560 --> 01:37.100
that if you're claiming
residency in Monaco, you should

01:37.220 --> 01:39.000
actually be a

01:39.120 --> 01:40.960
resident in Monaco.

01:41.359 --> 01:44.600
He asked me to pretend to be him,
to look after the place,

01:45.173 --> 01:46.639
collect the mail.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.960
But why the gun?

01:55.314 --> 01:58.040
He must have felt like he
was in some sort of danger.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.560
What if...

02:01.680 --> 02:03.240
... this wasn't an accident?

02:04.540 --> 02:06.240
What if he's still in danger?

02:06.972 --> 02:09.759
What?
I just got a text from his phone.

02:10.359 --> 02:12.832
Saying what?
Saying sorry.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
Okay.

02:14.169 --> 02:17.260
That's nuts.
You don't think this is all

02:17.380 --> 02:19.000
a little bit weird?

02:19.120 --> 02:22.279
I think it's weird that you're
even thinking like this.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.920
Don't do this.

02:29.529 --> 02:30.760
I should go.

02:32.873 --> 02:33.960
Look,

02:34.080 --> 02:35.375
I'm sorry.

02:37.279 --> 02:39.960
I wish he was still alive too.

03:29.132 --> 03:30.400
Police.

03:33.639 --> 03:35.480
I am a colleague of Mr. Jukes.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.839
Who?

03:36.920 --> 03:38.760
Speak to him yourself.

03:41.776 --> 03:42.839
Who are you?

03:42.959 --> 03:45.119
I wanted to see if you
knew of the apartment.

03:45.239 --> 03:47.800
Can I talk to you at the police station,
Mrs. Clios?

03:48.040 --> 03:49.519
Shall I send a car?

03:49.639 --> 03:51.279
No, I'll follow him.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.000
Here's a list of potential new clients.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.480
Our investors are spooked.
We need to show some money coming in.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.160
For example?

05:13.280 --> 05:16.934
Jakob Negrescu offered us
his account nine months ago

05:17.054 --> 05:18.397
and we turned him away.

05:18.517 --> 05:20.778
It's a big account.
It would do what we need it to do.

05:20.898 --> 05:23.080
The bank's dealings
need to be above board,

05:23.160 --> 05:26.248
reputable. Father always insisted.
Not always.

05:27.645 --> 05:29.701
What?
Not in the harder days when

05:29.821 --> 05:31.692
we were first starting out.

05:31.812 --> 05:34.208
You think you get rich
by being reputable

05:34.328 --> 05:35.680
every step of the way?

05:35.760 --> 05:38.279
Reputable is what you buy you've already

05:38.400 --> 05:39.680
made your fortune.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.920
And you know that how?

05:42.363 --> 05:44.359
Darling, I was there, remember?

05:44.480 --> 05:46.120
Father asked for your advice?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.317
All the time.

05:50.624 --> 05:53.276
Look, Negrescu's

05:53.396 --> 05:55.359
company owns real estate,
mostly downtown.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.400
Some diversify now,
so it's a couple of hotels, a casino.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.119
Oh, a casino. Well, that would be

06:00.239 --> 06:02.259
why father steered clear, I imagine.

06:02.379 --> 06:05.600
Negrescu worked for your father
back in the day. His lawyer.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.200
Sounds like a crook to me.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.839
Christos,

06:08.959 --> 06:10.960
you want to stop putting that stuff up

06:11.040 --> 06:12.824
your nose and get it together, okay?

06:17.624 --> 06:19.800
It was fine playing at
being the big boss

06:19.920 --> 06:22.480
when Constantine was here,
but he's gone now.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.639
Time to step up.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.960
Take a seat.

06:36.290 --> 06:39.512
How long is this gonna take?
I'll let him know you're here.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.400
Mr. Delormes?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.560
Hello, Mrs. Clios. How are you?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.663
A bit confused as to why I'm

07:22.783 --> 07:24.621
meeting a Mr. Jukes. Do you know him?

07:24.741 --> 07:27.000
I do. Are you with the lawyer?

07:27.307 --> 07:28.640
Should I be?

07:28.760 --> 07:31.200
I doubt you have
anything to worry about.

07:33.516 --> 07:35.600
Actually, there's something else.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.440
When are they gonna release
my husband's things?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.000
Soon, I believe.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.120
Was there something in particular?

07:42.513 --> 07:44.009
His phone.

07:44.471 --> 07:47.340
I haven't seen a phone.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.240
I'm not sure. I'll check.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.653
I have to go.
Goodbye.

07:51.773 --> 07:54.680
Officer Jukes. I'm with Interpol.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.760
Serious Financial Crime Agency.

07:57.305 --> 07:58.960
Will you come this way?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.040
Can we have the room?

08:12.688 --> 08:14.440
Please have a seat.

08:28.485 --> 08:29.960
You're an American.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.354
What do you want?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.532
Are you always this rude?

08:34.760 --> 08:37.039
A strange man has been following me.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.359
I have no idea why I'm in this room.

08:41.227 --> 08:43.279
You're from the East Coast.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.680
Do your family still live there?

08:46.043 --> 08:48.519
My father lives in New York.

08:48.639 --> 08:51.080
My mother's dead. I have no siblings.

08:52.207 --> 08:54.200
No doubt you already know all of this.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.920
Tell me about your father.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.080
He was a stockbroker.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.643
And he presently resides
in the Metropolitan

09:04.763 --> 09:06.916
Correctional Facility in New York.

09:11.974 --> 09:14.040
It's not too bad as far as prisons go.

09:14.753 --> 09:17.040
How many people know
of his incarceration?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.839
As few as possible.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.640
Are you threatening me, Mr. Jukes?

09:23.700 --> 09:26.940
You can't be held responsible
for your father's affairs.

09:29.779 --> 09:31.660
Those of your husband's, however.

09:31.860 --> 09:32.940
What of them?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.060
You were his curator.

09:37.447 --> 09:38.620
Yes.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.419
That's how we met.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.980
Meaning you bought and
sold works of art for him.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.860
That is what a curator does.

09:47.595 --> 09:50.380
Does the name John Brandyce
mean anything to you?

09:51.539 --> 09:53.380
Yes, he's also a collector,...

09:53.779 --> 09:55.140
... like Constantine.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.500
They sometimes bid on the same pieces.

09:57.620 --> 09:58.779
Frequently?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.779
Bidding at auction is
frequently anonymous.

10:02.460 --> 10:05.140
It's the auction house's
responsibility to check...

10:05.260 --> 10:06.900
... the bidder's credentials.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.220
Are you acquainted with Mr. Brandyce?

10:09.340 --> 10:10.900
No, I never met him.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.500
A painting by Claude Lorrain.

10:16.580 --> 10:20.218
Juno Confiding lo to the Care
of Argus was bought from

10:20.338 --> 10:22.539
Mr. Brandyce last year for $15 million.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.340
Yes. I bid on it myself.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.325
It was quite the coup at the time.
Congratulations.

10:29.419 --> 10:30.500
Thank you.

10:31.997 --> 10:33.980
Are you aware that the same painting

10:34.140 --> 10:36.580
was bought by Mr. Brandyce ten years ago

10:36.779 --> 10:38.380
for $2 million?

10:38.800 --> 10:39.860
No,

10:39.980 --> 10:42.220
but the art market has been booming, so

10:42.340 --> 10:45.179
It was sold to him by Comstantine Clios.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.311
What are you implying?
A profit of $13 million?

10:54.137 --> 10:56.820
A painting sold twice between friends.

10:56.940 --> 11:00.136
I wasn't aware they were friends.
I never met the man.

11:00.256 --> 11:03.368
Well, your husband, on the other hand.
He had many associates.

11:04.060 --> 11:07.016
The art world is the
last unregulated market.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.335
Ideal for money laundering.
Constantine would never.

11:10.455 --> 11:13.179
We have been tracking the
movement of your husband's funds

11:13.340 --> 11:15.020
from a series of companies to various

11:15.100 --> 11:16.820
bank accounts held in Monaco.

11:17.020 --> 11:20.054
I had no knowledge of my
husband's financial affairs.

11:20.174 --> 11:21.380
No.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.419
But perhaps you do know
that from a financial

11:23.500 --> 11:25.914
point of view,
Monaco is the best place to die.

11:26.940 --> 11:29.620
Or the best place for funds
to be held in probate.

11:34.341 --> 11:37.235
I cannot believe Madame can be so naive.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.220
Death duties in France

11:39.340 --> 11:42.179
amount to 50% of all inheritance.

11:42.299 --> 11:44.900
In Monaco, they simply don't exist.

11:47.618 --> 11:50.523
Are you telling me you know
nothing of such financial matters?

11:51.340 --> 11:53.039
I intend to learn.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.868
Oh, a course in actuarial accountancy,
perhaps?

11:58.060 --> 12:01.140
Is this interview over?

12:02.020 --> 12:05.100
I have no intention of detaining
you any further. Good day.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.965
I thought I heard something...

13:26.342 --> 13:28.880
This house is too big.
Haunted.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.748
The House of Clios.

13:31.279 --> 13:32.800
Sounds like a horror movie.

13:33.228 --> 13:34.839
Or a Greek tragedy.

13:35.283 --> 13:38.335
What is it about this painting?
You're always staring at it.

13:38.845 --> 13:41.160
I bought it for your
father because he loved it.

13:41.879 --> 13:45.120
Juno Confiding lo to the Care of Argus.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.960
So I look at it and I think of him.

13:50.843 --> 13:52.920
But something's changed.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.920
Maybe it's the moonlight.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.928
Or maybe it's because he's gone.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.400
He loved you, you know. He did.

14:08.111 --> 14:09.480
Are you gonna leave?

14:10.591 --> 14:12.120
Once you're paid off?

14:12.867 --> 14:15.104
Why would you say something like that?

14:16.818 --> 14:18.400
Do you want me to leave?

14:22.680 --> 14:24.210
I don't know what I want.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.560
But I do know that people
leave me when I like them.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.582
There should be a word for it, Madame.
A word for what, Patrice?

14:53.702 --> 14:56.560
For the unblemished portion
of wall upon which a picture.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.920
Once rested...

14:58.839 --> 15:00.160
So you noticed?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.720
Some time ago.

15:04.359 --> 15:05.879
The frame has been moved.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.017
Why didn't you say anything?

15:09.120 --> 15:12.236
There are some things best left unsaid.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.886
That's becoming quite a theme.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.221
Madame?

15:19.716 --> 15:21.480
Do you know of anything else

15:21.600 --> 15:23.473
best left unsaid?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.359
I still run this house, you know.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.920
Tell Antal I wanna review
our security arrangements.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.320
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

15:54.789 --> 15:57.320
Well, I was just saying, I thought

15:57.400 --> 15:59.569
the drains were leaking and in you walk.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.080
Give us five minutes, would you.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.551
Take this, please. Thank you.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.129
One of my what?

16:22.038 --> 16:25.320
Do you want the Immigration Office
to pay your brothels a visit?

16:34.196 --> 16:36.519
No, I've fucked all the girls that work

16:36.600 --> 16:38.519
for me, but I never fucked this one.

16:38.639 --> 16:40.879
A skinny little bitch. Not my type.

16:41.305 --> 16:42.886
Look properly.

16:43.141 --> 16:44.588
I've looked.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.214
Look again.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.600
Have you been missing me, Delormes?

16:52.826 --> 16:55.800
I mean, it's been a while since
you last showed up for

16:55.920 --> 16:57.639
no reason asking questions,

16:57.800 --> 17:00.120
sniffing around, I mean, every chance

17:00.200 --> 17:01.787
you get for, let's be honest,

17:01.907 --> 17:03.600
tenuous reasons.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.079
If you weren't such a boring arsehole,

17:06.160 --> 17:08.680
I would wonder if maybe
you want to fuck me?

17:12.878 --> 17:14.398
Oui, merci.

17:17.480 --> 17:22.000
You're coming very close to annoying me,
actually, and...

17:23.519 --> 17:25.599
... that would be a mistake.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.741
Are you threatening me?

17:46.484 --> 17:48.239
The Lorrain...

17:48.359 --> 17:50.320
Has anyone touched it or moved it?

17:50.400 --> 17:51.879
No, of course not.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.560
We would have seen.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.200
There are infra-red
alarms set every night.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.390
Also, each of the works in the Gallery

17:58.510 --> 18:01.759
has its individual sound sensor.
How far back do these go?

18:01.879 --> 18:03.560
The seven steps, five months

18:03.680 --> 18:05.480
since the new system was installed.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.279
Who is that?

18:09.711 --> 18:11.024
Christos.

18:12.896 --> 18:14.659
What's he doing?

18:15.172 --> 18:18.200
I imagine he needed access to the room.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.537
Which room?

18:20.040 --> 18:22.960
Monsieur Clios had
a safe room installed,

18:23.865 --> 18:25.839
along with the new security system.

18:26.960 --> 18:31.120
Oh, I see. Wine was Tino's thing.
I never went to the cellar.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.240
Can you show me?

18:42.007 --> 18:44.122
You can't use the house code, Madame.

18:44.242 --> 18:46.080
The safe code has eight digits.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.362
Well, what is it?
Forgive me, Madame, I can't tell you.

18:51.639 --> 18:54.040
Cannot or will not?
Cannot.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.256
I don't know them.
Well, who does?

18:56.920 --> 18:58.359
Only Christos.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.880
You will be paid.
If there's nothing to hide,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.920
why not open the books?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.240
Charming.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.127
A time like this and you
question his integrity?

19:22.359 --> 19:25.157
My client wants to see more information.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.383
Are they the lawyers
come to read the will?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.657
No, no, that happens tomorrow.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.399
Maybe it's all falling apart.

19:38.519 --> 19:40.869
What is?
The House of Clios.

19:42.359 --> 19:45.000
The men in dark suits
have come to collect.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.800
Well, your father's death
is worrying the investors.

19:47.879 --> 19:49.000
Vampires.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.140
Maybe they were the ghost last night.

19:52.839 --> 19:54.440
We have to save him.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.600
I wouldn't underestimate Christos.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.960
Yes, but someone has to do something.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.351
Jesus Christ!

20:14.251 --> 20:15.661
Is she legal?

20:15.781 --> 20:17.800
Shut your fucking mouth!

20:17.920 --> 20:19.239
The meeting's over.

20:19.359 --> 20:21.519
Take your shit.
Get out.

20:22.279 --> 20:24.240
Come on. Come on.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.720
That was nice.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.000
Nice?

20:46.592 --> 20:47.966
Alright...

20:48.839 --> 20:50.314
It was good.

20:50.434 --> 20:51.800
Better, I suppose.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.960
Would you do something for me,
Commissioner?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.320
Well,...

20:56.839 --> 20:58.480
... if you ask nicely.

20:58.932 --> 21:00.800
It's about the investigation.

21:01.230 --> 21:02.320
Okay.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.120
Will you tell me what they find out?

21:09.199 --> 21:11.800
You know it's in the hands
of the Maritime Division.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.760
I'm not...
Yeah, but you...

21:14.359 --> 21:16.040
... you oversee everything.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.665
I'll see what I can do.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.760
But so far it looks like, you know,

21:20.839 --> 21:23.659
they had bad luck, you know,
a full set of fuel tanks.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.358
Where are you going?

21:29.478 --> 21:30.839
Actually,

21:31.040 --> 21:33.920
I have an engagement and you
need to get back to the station.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.200
Aren't you going to return the favour?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.400
Best to leave you wanting.

22:28.362 --> 22:30.040
Looking for something?

22:36.519 --> 22:38.120
Can I ask you something?

22:38.240 --> 22:39.400
Sure.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.839
Who used to buy paintings
for Constantine?

22:42.160 --> 22:44.000
Before you, you mean?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.040
I don't know.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.160
I never really took much of an interest.

22:51.639 --> 22:54.639
Monday there would be a space
on the wall, the next some

22:54.720 --> 22:56.800
Impressionistic nightmare.

22:57.519 --> 23:00.120
I don't know who actually
bought them for him.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.879
Dealers and brokers, I guess.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.072
You'll never guess it,

23:05.440 --> 23:06.774
the password.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.600
He delighted in having
cryptic passwords.

23:11.084 --> 23:13.760
He delighted in being cryptic generally.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.680
More than I ever realised.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.120
I remember that creak.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.960
It always told me that he was here.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.480
Maybe he still is.

23:34.639 --> 23:36.490
Okay, sure, well,

23:36.610 --> 23:38.839
and if he is, you're taking the blame

23:38.920 --> 23:41.080
for damaging his antique furniture.

23:46.639 --> 23:47.879
Robert?

23:50.560 --> 23:51.800
Who's Robert?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.720
A friend of yours?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.400
Mr. Negrescu.

24:16.519 --> 24:17.680
Irina?

24:18.200 --> 24:19.480
Mrs. Clios.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.600
Oh, oh,
sorry to hear about your husband.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.960
Ex-husband.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.639
So was I.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.000
You've come a long way, Jakob.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.982
It looks good on you.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.600
So what are we doing here, Irina?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.913
Building a new wing for the hospital.

24:45.033 --> 24:46.879
You know what I mean.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.540
You came to our bank a while
ago and we turned you away.

24:52.279 --> 24:54.279
That was our mistake.

24:55.844 --> 24:58.800
I would like to apologise.
I'd like to make things right.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.000
Constantine's death is
scaring the investors.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.078
We could use some friends,

25:05.359 --> 25:07.760
and I thought what better friends

25:08.691 --> 25:10.160
than old friends.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.107
Is that what we are?

25:15.074 --> 25:16.240
Well,...

25:16.960 --> 25:18.240
... something like that.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.160
We could use your account.

25:20.879 --> 25:23.879
No, to be honest,
I was expecting to meet Christos.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.560
Doesn't he make these decisions now?

25:32.670 --> 25:34.359
Okay, alright.

25:35.649 --> 25:37.600
You can have our account.

25:38.832 --> 25:40.947
Perhaps we can make this

25:41.067 --> 25:43.659
arrangement more appealing.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.400
The Clios Foundation,

25:46.600 --> 25:49.519
gala dinners, charitable fundraisers,

25:49.639 --> 25:51.720
helping kids in wheelchairs?

25:52.279 --> 25:53.720
It's class.

25:54.489 --> 25:56.204
If you compare with casinos,

25:56.324 --> 25:58.080
I suppose it is...

25:58.768 --> 25:59.839
Well,

26:00.680 --> 26:03.720
I think I'd like to
make a small donation.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.075
A little philanthropy to go

26:06.195 --> 26:08.434
with that rather exquisite suit.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.600
I'd be happy to take your money.
Thank you.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.276
In fact,
I think we can do more for each other.

26:14.689 --> 26:17.303
A banker, Alfredo Dumont,

26:17.632 --> 26:21.440
he is the ringleader
in our little stampede.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.484
It would be to all our benefit

26:23.604 --> 26:25.360
if he were more reasonable.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.000
An unreasonable banker.

26:29.648 --> 26:33.359
I assume we would be gentle with him?

26:34.080 --> 26:36.470
I wouldn't tell you how to do your job.

26:41.881 --> 26:44.279
You really have come a long way, Jakob.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.040
Robert?

27:58.029 --> 27:59.415
You owe me, Robert.

27:59.535 --> 28:01.423
Hey! What a nice surprise.

28:01.543 --> 28:04.438
You owe me for the Tiepolo cartoon,
for covering your ass,

28:04.558 --> 28:06.502
for covering your forgery.
Hey, alright, look,

28:06.622 --> 28:08.274
I'm not gonna argue with you.
You owe me, Robert,

28:08.394 --> 28:11.277
and you have the fucking temerity
to act like I'm other people?

28:12.320 --> 28:14.040
What, George? Wait.

28:15.095 --> 28:17.920
Georgie, what's going on?
I think you know.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.720
At least tell me what
you're looking for.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.670
A rectangular canvas
worth about 15 million.

28:22.790 --> 28:26.759
Hey, these are just junk, George.
So I was looking at the Lorrain,

28:26.879 --> 28:29.000
you know,
the big phallic god dude hiding

28:29.080 --> 28:31.654
secrets in plain view
from his poor dumb wife,

28:31.774 --> 28:33.359
and I kept thinking,

28:33.440 --> 28:36.279
"How blind do you have to be to not see

28:36.359 --> 28:38.343
"what is right in front of you?"

28:39.600 --> 28:40.920
Who painted it?

28:41.358 --> 28:43.720
Why are you asking me?
Because I know you, Robert.

28:43.839 --> 28:45.560
I know you can fake documents,

28:45.639 --> 28:49.298
chains of title. You're no forger but
you certainly have an eye for one

28:49.418 --> 28:51.359
and you know just
the right person to use.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.560
Are you gonna keep lying to me?

28:57.901 --> 28:59.960
It was a mate of mine

29:00.080 --> 29:02.200
who lives out near Grasse.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.960
I wanna know how you got it in there,

29:06.424 --> 29:09.519
past the security cameras.
How did you get the codes?

29:09.960 --> 29:13.320
Robert?
How did you get the security codes?

29:13.796 --> 29:16.240
I wanna know who you
sold the original to.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.200
What shady dealer in what shady country.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.760
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.600
George?

29:26.600 --> 29:27.839
Wait.

29:29.359 --> 29:31.800
I didn't.
What do you mean, you didn't?

29:31.920 --> 29:33.680
I didn't do it to you.

29:35.839 --> 29:38.879
Your husband did it to you.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.800
Constantine commissioned the Lorrain.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.719
What? Why?
He needed to sell the original,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.839
but like the big phallic
dude that he was,

30:00.920 --> 30:03.000
he had to hide that fact from his

30:03.480 --> 30:04.920
highly observant wife.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.479
But from more than his wife, I'm sure.

30:08.123 --> 30:10.506
Are you saying that
Constantine needed money?

30:10.626 --> 30:12.159
I didn't ask.

30:12.279 --> 30:14.080
And perhaps neither should you.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.651
Are you fucking with me?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.000
Because I have to ask, Robert.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.519
I got a text from his phone. Was it you?

30:22.639 --> 30:23.879
Of course not.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.040
Somebody has come back to haunt me.
I am asking you,

30:27.709 --> 30:30.880
is my husband really dead?
What the...? That's insane.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.879
Yes, it is,
but everything is telling me that

30:32.960 --> 30:35.760
he could still be alive.
I find out that he's a crook,

30:35.879 --> 30:37.760
and that maybe it was more expedient

30:37.880 --> 30:39.680
for him to die suddenly
the way that he did.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.892
What am I supposed to think?
So you think there's

30:42.012 --> 30:43.760
some sort of conspiracy.
We didn't just fake a painting,

30:43.880 --> 30:45.320
but your husband's death too.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.639
Did you?
No.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.800
Hi, you've reached Constantine Clios.
I'm not available right now.

31:45.097 --> 31:47.626
Hi, you've reached Constantine...

32:12.467 --> 32:13.920
He loves these.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.200
Loved, surely?

32:20.120 --> 32:22.187
I don't know anything any more.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.879
That's one thing I'm sure of.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.320
There are more things
in heaven and earth.

32:32.279 --> 32:34.076
Were you sure of him?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.535
I knew him better than any.

32:40.671 --> 32:42.508
I met him later in life.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.680
He didn't have anything to prove.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.400
I didn't judge him like you do.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.960
His wealth didn't impress me.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.920
I wasn't from this world,

32:53.519 --> 32:55.427
Monaco, the Riviera.

32:56.080 --> 32:59.359
I loved the part of him
that transcends all of this.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.685
Lucky you.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.200
I saw no part of my father that wasn't

33:05.279 --> 33:08.040
entirely conditioned by, as you put it,

33:09.120 --> 33:10.591
this world.

33:13.519 --> 33:15.550
The Devil's finest trick

33:16.240 --> 33:19.429
is to persuade you
that he doesn't exist.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.166
The Devil's finest trick

33:22.286 --> 33:24.494
Is to persuade you
that he doesn't exist.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.032
Don't underestimate me, Adam.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.200
I wouldn't dare.

33:38.155 --> 33:40.359
Who said the Devil's a he?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.080
Baudelaire.

35:27.945 --> 35:29.818
Why do you stay here?

35:30.353 --> 35:31.879
Where should I go?

35:34.936 --> 35:36.160
Your mother's.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.712
Then the seventh circle of hell.
I don't think so.

35:42.512 --> 35:44.800
You are only ever here in summer.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.182
Yeah, but I like coming back to you,

35:47.302 --> 35:49.160
seeing you working the vines.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.200
Tell the truth,

35:58.007 --> 36:00.040
you've loved it too.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.858
There wasn't much else to look at.

36:03.588 --> 36:05.960
Remember you thought
the old barn was haunted.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.080
Yeah,

36:07.160 --> 36:09.000
I thought the whole place was haunted.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.356
Well, it wasn't. It was just

36:12.760 --> 36:14.320
waiting for a ghost.

36:15.639 --> 36:17.714
Are you still trying to freak me out?

36:21.203 --> 36:22.440
Maybe.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.295
Fuck me.

36:28.883 --> 36:30.120
Fuck off.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.200
No, fuck you.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.101
No.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.708
Bonjour, Madame.

38:31.754 --> 38:33.480
Clios.
You're late.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.040
Aren't you excited to see
what Constantine left you?

38:37.160 --> 38:38.359
Oui, Madame.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.923
Can you handle two?

38:40.043 --> 38:41.179
Two?

38:41.200 --> 38:43.000
Two Madame Clios.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.279
Of course. You are expected.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.941
I'll just be a moment.

39:42.879 --> 39:44.596
Hello, Mrs. Clios.

39:48.802 --> 39:50.440
You found his phone.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.759
Yes.

39:51.879 --> 39:53.960
The Monaco Police sent it over.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
It was among the recovered items,

39:56.120 --> 39:58.715
but they had to dry it out
before they could ID the owner.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.408
Hello?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.320
Hello?

40:29.240 --> 40:31.200
Bonjour, Madame. Bienvenue.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.122
Shall we sit?

40:40.564 --> 40:41.913
Okay.

40:42.436 --> 40:43.834
Here we go.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.000
I have before me the testamorograph,

40:50.120 --> 40:52.123
the holographic will

40:52.243 --> 40:54.421
of Constantine Clios,

40:54.720 --> 40:56.678
signed by his own hand.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.160
I see we are fortunately

40:59.320 --> 41:01.575
excused the matter of dealing with

41:01.695 --> 41:03.960
nil rate band legacies.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.320
Excuse me,

41:05.400 --> 41:06.760
could you elaborate?

41:07.080 --> 41:09.920
Since your father died in Monaco waters,

41:10.120 --> 41:12.279
Monaco law, not French law,

41:12.400 --> 41:14.359
applies to inheritance tax,

41:14.440 --> 41:16.120
death duties and so forth.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.402
And what does Monaco law
say about inheritance tax?

41:19.522 --> 41:22.441
It says there is no inheritance tax.
That is correct.

41:22.696 --> 41:24.751
Even in death, your father was

41:24.871 --> 41:27.219
a fastidious man of business.

41:30.497 --> 41:32.990
It is the will of Constantine Clios

41:33.110 --> 41:35.920
that the main portion of his estate,
including the assets

41:36.040 --> 41:39.200
of his banking interests
and such liquidity as exists

41:39.279 --> 41:40.960
in the Clios Foundation,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.240
be divided according to custom

41:43.359 --> 41:45.080
in the following manner.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.540
To his surviving widow,

41:48.660 --> 41:50.839
that is Georgina Clios,

41:50.920 --> 41:52.800
one quarter part.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.650
To each of his three children,

41:55.770 --> 41:57.519
one quarter part each.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.680
Now,
in the case of the personal bequests,

42:00.879 --> 42:02.600
to my son, Christos,

42:02.800 --> 42:05.720
I leave my private aero plane,
my collection

42:05.840 --> 42:08.359
of Patek Philippe wristwatches,

42:08.440 --> 42:10.692
my townhouse in London,

42:10.812 --> 42:12.568
and the apartment and

42:12.688 --> 42:15.359
associated yacht berthing
in Marina di Portofino.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.519
To my son, Adam,

42:17.760 --> 42:20.480
I leave my Aston Martin 177,

42:20.560 --> 42:23.279
my vacation property in San Bartolome,

42:23.480 --> 42:25.710
my library of first editions,

42:25.830 --> 42:28.000
my Charles Hollander chess set.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.359
You've got a car.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.791
To my daughter, Ariana,

42:31.911 --> 42:34.560
I leave my Porsche 959,

42:34.800 --> 42:37.944
to be held in trust
until her 21st birthday,

42:39.080 --> 42:42.040
and all property and
livestock associated

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
with my stud farm in Burgundy.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.879
You got a pony.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.960
To my wife, Georgina,

42:48.080 --> 42:50.463
I leave my collection of artworks.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.560
Excuse me, Monsieur,

42:54.680 --> 42:57.719
please forgive this intrusion
but this is a police matter.

42:57.839 --> 43:00.960
I have a convocation to be
served to the Clios family.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.080
Ah, but this is unprecedented.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.867
I also have warrants
to be served to you,

43:04.987 --> 43:08.040
the family lawyer,
concerning the Clios estate.

43:08.279 --> 43:09.669
Warrants?

43:09.789 --> 43:11.600
Well, to what end?
The estate,

43:11.760 --> 43:13.452
the Clios Foundation

43:13.572 --> 43:16.040
and all the holdings of the Clios Bank

43:16.200 --> 43:17.879
and family are to be frozen,

43:17.960 --> 43:20.515
pending an ongoing
criminal investigation.

43:20.635 --> 43:22.720
Whatever were the provisions

43:22.839 --> 43:25.239
of the will, they are suspended.

43:25.359 --> 43:26.645
I see.

43:26.765 --> 43:29.560
Well, was it really necessary,
sir, to choose this moment?

43:29.680 --> 43:31.302
I'm afraid it's rare for a family

43:31.422 --> 43:33.800
as international as this to
be gathered in the same place

43:33.920 --> 43:36.240
at the same time.
Well, what about our inheritance?

43:36.360 --> 43:37.960
There is no inheritance any more.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.359
You're obliged to
surrender your passports

43:40.440 --> 43:43.080
and remain resident
at the definite place,

43:43.364 --> 43:45.640
that is, the Villa Carmela,

43:45.760 --> 43:48.260
and report to the
police station regularly

43:48.380 --> 43:50.560
until I determine the
investigation is over.

43:50.680 --> 43:53.028
Well, you must have a
fucked up sense of humour.

43:53.148 --> 43:55.824
I'm sorry, Miss Clios?
Well, the four

43:55.944 --> 43:58.519
of us living together in the same house?

43:58.639 --> 44:00.039
I mean,

44:00.159 --> 44:02.160
like a real family?

44:02.639 --> 44:04.793
Oh, that's just mean.
