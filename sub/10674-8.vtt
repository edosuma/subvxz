WEBVTT

00:00.353 --> 00:02.469
- Previously on Underground...
- What's your business here?

00:02.521 --> 00:04.806
We could work together,
apprehend these runaways

00:04.807 --> 00:05.807
and split the bounty.

00:05.809 --> 00:06.939
Want to be a moral leader?

00:06.977 --> 00:09.227
The begins at home.

00:09.278 --> 00:11.637
Now I promised that I was gonna
get you back in that shop.

00:11.698 --> 00:13.198
I need you working on the grandstand

00:13.199 --> 00:14.198
for my nomination announcement.

00:14.954 --> 00:15.916
I saw him, Daddy.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.618
Sam... I saw him running.

00:17.670 --> 00:18.843
We don't know where we running to.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.371
"Wolf," "underworld," "angel"?

00:20.373 --> 00:22.173
Don't none of that
sound like freedom to me.

00:22.208 --> 00:23.341
It sound like death.

00:24.844 --> 00:26.094
Henry!

00:31.285 --> 00:34.585
Stay with us, Noah.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.247
They're still coming for us.

00:38.283 --> 00:40.670
The Undertaker's gonna take us
to the next station.

00:43.159 --> 00:44.359
Put him here!

00:45.746 --> 00:47.445
He lost too much blood!

00:47.448 --> 00:48.447
What happened?

00:48.499 --> 00:49.448
We got to get this bullet out!

00:49.450 --> 00:50.448
Ain't no time.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.500
Fire got some, but not all.

00:51.534 --> 00:53.368
- Got who?
- Patty Cannon Gang.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.786
- I need a knife.
- We need to move him now!

00:54.838 --> 00:56.537
Hey, I can't risk taking
him to the next station,

00:56.590 --> 00:58.039
compromising the whole cell.

00:58.091 --> 01:00.792
Just give us a wagon!
We give ourself a head start.

01:00.793 --> 01:02.210
They gonna spot you before
you get to the river.

01:02.262 --> 01:05.063
Look, these bodies are bound
to go to the graveyard

01:05.066 --> 01:06.242
in PappyJack.

01:06.278 --> 01:07.551
We'll hide you in there.

01:07.585 --> 01:08.679
Won't get you across the river,

01:08.680 --> 01:11.552
but it'll get you a good head start.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.688
Henry...

01:15.058 --> 01:18.609
All right, we gonna put
this devil's snare in here.

01:18.644 --> 01:20.144
It gonna help with the swelling.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.313
Move, house girl!

01:21.364 --> 01:22.813
There ain't no time
to be standing around!

01:22.865 --> 01:24.483
They gonna be here any minute!

01:24.534 --> 01:27.152
I thought the crosses signaled for four.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.323
One of us didn't make it.

01:33.877 --> 01:35.043
Legs!

01:36.914 --> 01:38.629
Listen carefully now.
Be careful with him!

01:38.664 --> 01:39.831
When you reach the river,
head west for two miles

01:39.883 --> 01:42.167
to a rickety bridge
that looks like a crooked smile.

01:42.218 --> 01:44.002
Listen, when you cross it,
go to the top of the hill,

01:44.054 --> 01:46.638
look for a house
got a lantern in the window.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.890
Belongs to a man
named John, John Hawkes.

01:48.926 --> 01:52.377
Tell him a friend of a friend sent you.

02:32.769 --> 02:37.201
Underground - 01x08 - Graves

02:49.902 --> 02:51.485
It's Ernestine, right?

02:51.538 --> 02:52.903
Mm-hmm.

02:52.956 --> 02:54.573
Thank you.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.074
These eggs,

02:56.075 --> 02:57.992
my mother used to make
them just like this.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.626
It's the way Massa Tom like 'em.

03:00.401 --> 03:01.364
Sugar?

03:08.657 --> 03:10.546
Your daughter's one of the Macon Seven.

03:11.501 --> 03:12.490
Isn't she?

03:23.959 --> 03:25.903
The last I'd heard, they
made it through Kentucky.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.941
Thank you.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.028
Here, let me.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.139
Oh, no, gestures like that
do more harm than good.

03:40.204 --> 03:43.038
Reverend Willowset,
I presume... good morning.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.007
Mr. Hawkes, I was told
you'd arrived last night.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.341
What brings you to Georgia?

03:47.377 --> 03:49.677
Today of all days,
the idea of Sam running

03:49.712 --> 03:51.596
is worse than Sam running.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.963
The reverend up.

03:53.507 --> 03:55.432
Okay, it can not get out
that he is gone.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.187
It won't, as long as we
the only ones that know.

03:58.223 --> 03:59.187
What about the boys?

03:59.223 --> 04:00.765
I done spoke to 'em.

04:01.693 --> 04:03.618
T.R. is out riding that pony of his.

04:03.653 --> 04:06.350
Won't be back till
well after the nomination.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.063
And James won't say anything?

04:09.703 --> 04:10.981
Who he got to tell?

04:11.478 --> 04:12.955
Your children will be the death of me.

04:13.486 --> 04:14.953
Ain't just mine.

04:15.018 --> 04:16.987
...and handed wisdom
from the Word of God.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.990
For example, "Thou shalt not
deliver unto his master

04:19.992 --> 04:22.994
the servant which has escaped
from his master unto thee."

04:22.995 --> 04:24.824
Oh, John, let the man have some coffee

04:24.877 --> 04:26.798
before you pull out your podium.

04:26.832 --> 04:29.204
I'd heard rumors that your
brother was a sympathizer.

04:30.173 --> 04:31.836
Couldn't know he was
also a man of the faith.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.254
You don't have to be worried

04:33.307 --> 04:34.805
about my influence
on my brother, Reverend.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.091
I can assure you

04:36.143 --> 04:37.475
he's never listened to me.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.425
No, my brother here,

04:38.478 --> 04:40.011
he's all, um, fire

04:40.062 --> 04:41.341
and no brimstone.

04:42.245 --> 04:45.310
Now, if you will excuse me,

04:45.598 --> 04:47.661
I'm expected in the city by noon.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.137
Well, you-you're gonna be back in time

04:51.173 --> 04:52.356
for my nomination, right?

04:52.408 --> 04:53.441
Of course.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.389
That's why I'm here.

04:57.682 --> 05:00.165
Every relationship is built on trust.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.283
Any one worth its shit, anyway.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.500
Now, you and I, we just met

05:03.536 --> 05:06.737
no more than 15 good whacks ago?

05:07.680 --> 05:08.757
I trust we will reach

05:08.791 --> 05:11.509
a point in your pain threshold

05:11.545 --> 05:13.815
where you will answer
my simple question.

05:14.911 --> 05:17.384
Where's the next stop
on your freedom train?

05:17.850 --> 05:19.550
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:21.053 --> 05:22.721
Now, Miss Patty, she's got your number.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.555
Knows y'all broke off into little units,

05:24.557 --> 05:27.858
so that no one man could
bring down the whole animal.

05:29.555 --> 05:30.523
It's smart.

05:30.978 --> 05:32.002
It's disciplined.

05:32.903 --> 05:33.889
See, I respect that.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.278
But you got to know
the name of the next guy

05:36.317 --> 05:37.567
or it doesn't work.

05:39.764 --> 05:41.744
And that guy's got to know
the name of the next guy.

05:42.555 --> 05:44.742
See, I'm not asking the world of you.

05:47.454 --> 05:49.228
All I need from you...

05:53.670 --> 05:56.588
...is the name of the man
on the other side of that river.

06:01.845 --> 06:03.093
See, and then,

06:03.146 --> 06:05.262
I'm gonna have a conversation with him,

06:06.338 --> 06:09.317
and we can start this all over again.

06:18.528 --> 06:20.944
Well, look who's back on the hunt.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.283
How's your ma, kid?

06:33.175 --> 06:35.343
Ever since I've been spending time

06:35.379 --> 06:38.178
with this gal over in
Charleston, it's been itching.

06:38.215 --> 06:39.846
- Where?
- Down there.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.066
Ah, got to see a doctor about that.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.183
Which one?

06:43.220 --> 06:44.386
The only one.

06:45.018 --> 06:46.697
Big white brick house
at the edge of town.

06:46.731 --> 06:47.939
You can't miss it.

06:47.973 --> 06:49.641
HappyJack used to be a mining town.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.975
Now it's a ghost town.

06:54.098 --> 06:56.639
I take it you didn't
catch them runners at the boat.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.401
Boys caught some trouble
with some Injuns.

07:00.358 --> 07:02.987
Yeah, the fire that burned down
all them brush huts?

07:04.875 --> 07:06.490
Lost a few men.

07:06.543 --> 07:07.879
Got one of theirs.

07:09.079 --> 07:10.661
Now, I suspect you noticed

07:10.663 --> 07:12.747
the trail ended here, otherwise,

07:12.798 --> 07:15.333
I'd have a silver spike
in-between my eyes.

07:15.384 --> 07:16.834
He didn't tell you where they went?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.052
Oh, I got a good idea.

07:18.088 --> 07:19.420
See, but that's the kind of information

07:19.473 --> 07:22.057
I would only share with a partner.

07:24.398 --> 07:26.247
Seeing how I'm short a few men,

07:26.249 --> 07:28.178
what do you say, August?

07:38.649 --> 07:40.608
I want the girl, you get the other two.

07:41.064 --> 07:42.064
Fair enough.

07:45.081 --> 07:46.790
Kid, you mind grabbing that blanket?

07:54.625 --> 07:55.673
Three dead bodies

07:55.709 --> 07:58.877
rotting away and not one single casket.

08:00.096 --> 08:01.627
I'm guessing they rode off in them.

08:02.432 --> 08:04.983
We just need to figure out
where they road off to.

08:29.326 --> 08:31.459
Noah! Noah?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.212
Help me!

08:43.889 --> 08:45.389
Noah?

08:45.424 --> 08:47.475
I know you hear me.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.894
He got a fever.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.181
He got more than that.
I know what infection look like.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.331
Noah?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.268
Noah, come on now, you hear me?

08:59.676 --> 09:01.482
Henry.

09:01.825 --> 09:03.600
I put devil's snare in his arm.

09:03.635 --> 09:05.053
Might be making him see things.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.196
Ain't no root work gonna fix that.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.653
He about to catch his death.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.331
I ain't losing nobody else!

09:13.427 --> 09:14.701
Now, we just got to get him

09:14.754 --> 09:16.120
some medicine
like the white folks got...

09:16.121 --> 09:18.321
The only thing we need
to do is get to freedom,

09:18.322 --> 09:19.957
and that's on the other
side of the river!

09:20.009 --> 09:21.960
I got a plan.

09:22.011 --> 09:23.101
I heard them drivers talking...

09:23.138 --> 09:25.013
No, I ain't spending no
more time on a dead man.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.713
That undertaker told me
where the next station is.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.268
He tell you?

09:29.936 --> 09:31.519
Mm-hmm.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.303
Be a real shame you go and

09:33.355 --> 09:35.940
and cross that river,
only to get caught.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.859
'Cause you ain't got no place to hide.

09:37.894 --> 09:38.976
I can make it.

09:39.028 --> 09:40.129
Tell me, house girl.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.698
I ain't going nowhere without Noah.

09:53.286 --> 09:55.459
What's this plan of yours?

09:58.443 --> 10:01.666
Where's the last place catchers
be looking for runaways?

10:04.221 --> 10:05.970
In a big house.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.975
We steal us some fancy clothes.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.518
Then we walk right
up that doctor's house

10:20.570 --> 10:21.602
at the edge of town

10:21.654 --> 10:23.687
like we supposed to be there.

10:29.446 --> 10:32.279
And once inside, we grab us
the medicine we need.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.709
No more sneaking around.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.211
We act like we free.

10:52.455 --> 10:54.071
You gotta move
a little closer, house girl.

10:54.123 --> 10:55.873
Ain't nor married man
with a woman look like you

10:55.908 --> 10:57.549
he ain't touchin' at all times.

10:57.994 --> 10:59.493
I'll play along when I have to.

10:59.544 --> 11:00.995
You just remember what you got to say.

11:00.996 --> 11:02.462
"Have to" say.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.164
Let be quick.

11:04.167 --> 11:06.833
Noah be too far gone,
the medicine ain't gonna take.

11:06.836 --> 11:08.251
He probably dead already.

11:08.303 --> 11:10.254
Might be we stay for tea.

11:12.924 --> 11:15.508
They beat all the love and trust
out of you, didn't they?

11:21.433 --> 11:22.767
Good evening.

11:22.818 --> 11:25.019
Uh, we were told that the doctor
lives here... is he in?

11:33.663 --> 11:34.745
You'll need to unbutton your dress

11:34.780 --> 11:36.197
so I may examine you.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.519
Um, come on, darling.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.585
Don't be shy.

11:43.222 --> 11:44.095
Now,

11:44.624 --> 11:45.706
tell me what happened.

11:45.758 --> 11:47.258
We were heading back to New York City

11:47.293 --> 11:49.210
when my wife suddenly fell faint.

11:49.922 --> 11:51.461
Uh, she recently with child.

11:52.881 --> 11:54.048
You're a long way from home.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.298
What brings you this way?

11:55.335 --> 11:57.684
Uh, work. I'm a soap maker.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.221
It's my only passion, except for my...

12:00.273 --> 12:02.889
beautiful wife, of course.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.312
Vitals seem to be good.

12:10.081 --> 12:11.565
I'm starting to feel better.

12:11.616 --> 12:14.534
Perhaps I only needed
just a bit of solid ground.

12:14.570 --> 12:16.821
Might I trouble you for some water?

12:17.629 --> 12:20.407
A little dizziness in the early
stages of pregnancy is normal.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.254
You two should be on your way.

12:30.970 --> 12:34.922
I just love the detailing
on your fireplace.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.542
Tuscan, right?

12:37.342 --> 12:38.509
You got a good eye.

12:41.230 --> 12:42.897
None of the folks in town have any eye

12:42.932 --> 12:44.181
for the finer things.

12:44.232 --> 12:45.254
Oh.

12:45.902 --> 12:48.402
You know, I've been considering
putting some new drapes in here,

12:48.437 --> 12:50.738
but, uh, I haven't found a fabric

12:50.773 --> 12:53.524
to match the sophistication of the mold.

12:53.576 --> 12:56.243
Have you heard of Rochestor's in Boston?

12:57.830 --> 12:59.779
Yeah, yeah, of course. Who hasn't?

12:59.831 --> 13:02.115
I... some prefer Calvin's,

13:02.118 --> 13:05.535
but I prefer Rochestor's
selection... it's better.

13:05.587 --> 13:06.836
Actually, I believe

13:06.873 --> 13:09.373
they just had a new shipment
in from India.

13:09.424 --> 13:10.703
Greens, pinks,

13:10.729 --> 13:12.625
with gold little tassels. It's the...

13:12.677 --> 13:14.128
You should, uh, send for a catalogue.

13:14.129 --> 13:15.129
Yeah.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.679
I will.

13:18.821 --> 13:19.850
Uh...

13:19.885 --> 13:21.018
Have you two eaten today?

13:21.567 --> 13:24.172
Uh, just a little bit
of breakfast this morning.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.222
Well, perhaps that is why
you felt faint.

13:26.988 --> 13:27.725
I would love it

13:27.777 --> 13:29.360
if you both would join me for dinner.

13:29.394 --> 13:30.860
Oh, we don't want to intrude.

13:30.897 --> 13:31.812
Oh, think nothing of it.

13:31.864 --> 13:33.147
My brother will be joining as well,

13:33.198 --> 13:35.149
and, uh, he's not one
to talk about decor.

13:36.201 --> 13:37.484
I'll, uh, I'll let my house girl

13:37.536 --> 13:39.036
know to set the table for two more.

13:39.071 --> 13:40.037
Hey, Letty!

13:41.059 --> 13:42.239
Tuscan columns?

13:42.290 --> 13:43.624
Well, you spend enough time

13:43.658 --> 13:44.825
on the edge of the white folks' world,

13:44.876 --> 13:45.875
you learn a few things.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.994
It's locked.

13:46.995 --> 13:48.913
I seen a key ring on his belt.

13:48.965 --> 13:50.413
Wait, wait, no, no.

13:50.466 --> 13:52.159
We attack him, it's only gonna
bring more trouble down on us.

13:52.195 --> 13:53.202
And we can't risk it with Noah hurt.

13:53.254 --> 13:54.835
We ain't gonna get another
chance to lift them keys.

13:54.836 --> 13:57.171
Unless you find another way
to get his clothes off.

13:59.557 --> 14:02.142
I guess his house girl
anything like my momma,

14:02.177 --> 14:04.260
she got a key to everything.

14:17.679 --> 14:18.860
Your ma's gonna be all right.

14:18.911 --> 14:20.693
She's going back home where she belongs.

14:21.346 --> 14:22.697
We should've gone with her.

14:24.450 --> 14:26.283
Jay'll take care of her
till we get back.

14:26.774 --> 14:27.918
If Jay ran,

14:28.679 --> 14:30.037
would you hunt him down?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.590
No.

14:36.711 --> 14:38.000
What we do ain't personal.

14:38.213 --> 14:39.207
It's the law.

14:40.015 --> 14:41.849
And these runaways are breaking it.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.717
Ma broke the rules, too.

14:45.463 --> 14:47.903
Those scratches on the door
at the hospital...

14:48.224 --> 14:49.889
she just wanted to get away from a place

14:49.942 --> 14:51.140
that didn't treat her right.

14:51.192 --> 14:54.360
Maybe that's all that that girl
and the others want.

15:02.370 --> 15:03.537
You know what this is?

15:03.572 --> 15:05.128
A letter from the bank.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.659
Jay always tryin' to hide 'em from me.

15:10.274 --> 15:12.783
But I snuck and read one
one night while he was asleep.

15:14.096 --> 15:15.381
Look at me.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.419
Last one said we got a month
to get the money.

15:21.638 --> 15:23.224
It was right before we left.

15:26.095 --> 15:28.095
What about the bounty
we collected on the other two?

15:28.147 --> 15:29.111
It ain't enough.

15:29.981 --> 15:32.599
Now, there ain't gonna be
no home to go back to

15:32.650 --> 15:33.933
for you, Jay or your ma,

15:33.985 --> 15:35.903
if we don't bring that girl back.

15:39.491 --> 15:41.825
We ain't got no choice
but to finish the hunt.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.610
I think we do have a choice.

15:43.662 --> 15:44.945
And I think...

15:47.207 --> 15:49.249
...this one's just easier for you.

15:52.171 --> 15:54.024
Found out there's two cemeteries

15:54.059 --> 15:55.332
between here and Ohio.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.191
They got a head start.

15:57.225 --> 15:58.876
We split up, cover more ground.

15:59.294 --> 16:00.961
We'll be there.

16:05.017 --> 16:06.596
Well, this will work nicely.

16:07.494 --> 16:08.802
The house in the background,

16:08.854 --> 16:11.138
a perfect tableau
of prosperity and power.

16:12.307 --> 16:14.475
It does feel as if something's missing.

16:14.476 --> 16:16.860
Uh, a local merchant offered up
a fireworks display,

16:16.895 --> 16:19.062
but I felt that it might be
a little too proud.

16:19.115 --> 16:21.532
Oh, no, I like fireworks.

16:21.972 --> 16:24.650
They, for me, represent
the scope of His glory,

16:25.307 --> 16:26.820
as best we can recreate it.

16:26.822 --> 16:29.288
I'll send my man out
to track him down, then.

16:32.244 --> 16:34.043
You a bit early, Schafer.

16:34.772 --> 16:37.630
I ain't never been early
for anything in my life.

16:38.384 --> 16:40.436
And I ain't here for your coronation.

16:41.052 --> 16:42.919
This belongs to you, doesn't it?

16:48.394 --> 16:51.979
He tried to bribe me to let him go.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.274
I appreciate you bringing him back.

17:03.299 --> 17:04.587
No skin off my back.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.192
These things happen from time to time.

17:07.165 --> 17:08.665
Although they seem to be
happening to you

17:08.718 --> 17:09.800
a lot more often lately.

17:10.634 --> 17:11.836
I guarantee,

17:11.887 --> 17:13.670
had you hung the bodies of those runners

17:13.694 --> 17:16.450
that'd been caught from the
front gates of this plantation,

17:16.935 --> 17:19.510
we wouldn't be standing out here today.

17:23.182 --> 17:25.098
A good leader learns

17:25.102 --> 17:26.307
from his mistakes.

17:28.238 --> 17:29.770
A dead body can be forgotten.

17:30.587 --> 17:32.606
That's why it's always Jesus
on the cross,

17:32.659 --> 17:33.771
not Jesus in the tomb.

17:35.268 --> 17:36.433
Sam here is gonna be

17:36.435 --> 17:38.269
a barely walking example

17:38.320 --> 17:40.270
of what happens when you try and run.

18:13.306 --> 18:14.537
Henry?

18:16.893 --> 18:19.227
Henry?

18:24.233 --> 18:26.867
Henry, I'm sorry.

18:26.903 --> 18:28.987
I'm sorry.

18:31.407 --> 18:33.875
I'm sorry, Henry.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.747
No, don't.

18:41.718 --> 18:42.834
Don't leave.

19:02.928 --> 19:04.078
Can I help you?

19:04.135 --> 19:06.691
We're after some runaways we
believe might've come this way.

19:06.692 --> 19:08.576
Mind if we take a look around?

19:08.611 --> 19:10.494
I promise we won't
steal anything, Sheriff.

19:15.034 --> 19:16.500
Runaways, you say?

19:16.536 --> 19:18.368
Shouldn't be too hard to find

19:18.371 --> 19:20.288
a bunch of dirty niggers in PappyJack.

19:20.797 --> 19:22.909
We don't got much of anyone around here.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.625
Place been closed down ever since

19:25.678 --> 19:27.045
Emageen passed.

19:27.558 --> 19:28.346
Didn't have no kin,

19:28.381 --> 19:30.674
no one to tell me what's missing.

19:34.261 --> 19:36.701
You don't happen to have
a map of the area, do you?

19:37.222 --> 19:38.772
Might have one in my wagon.

19:39.182 --> 19:40.998
Sit tight... I'll get it for you.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.241
Well, I'm guessing
they didn't walk out of here

19:58.243 --> 19:59.876
naked as the day they were born.

20:00.854 --> 20:03.047
Changed clothes so
they could hide in plain sight.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.700
Is there something you need, ma'am?

20:39.531 --> 20:42.153
I always found it easier
to make a bed with two.

20:55.969 --> 20:58.050
Miss Letty, right?

20:58.688 --> 21:00.048
Your dress real pretty.

21:02.142 --> 21:03.141
Must be you got a lot

21:03.143 --> 21:05.276
of fancy stuff up in New York City

21:05.310 --> 21:06.443
if that's for travelin'.

21:08.948 --> 21:09.896
You was listenin' to us.

21:09.949 --> 21:11.586
Don't tell massa.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.285
I just...

21:13.952 --> 21:15.987
I ain't never seen no niggers
like you before.

21:16.761 --> 21:18.472
I was curious.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.318
We ain't from New York.

21:28.218 --> 21:30.167
We runaways. We steal these clothes...

21:30.170 --> 21:32.336
Now, now, now, now, we need your help.

21:32.387 --> 21:33.971
Our friend hurt real bad.

21:34.007 --> 21:35.806
We need that key to get
in that medicine cabinet.

21:35.842 --> 21:37.258
Look, I don't want no trouble.

21:37.309 --> 21:38.675
And I don't want to get you in any.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.010
That's why I'm askin' you.

21:40.063 --> 21:41.429
I know anything go missin',

21:41.480 --> 21:42.930
you gonna get blamed, just like it was

21:42.981 --> 21:44.317
in my big house.

21:46.111 --> 21:47.351
Please.

21:47.403 --> 21:48.957
I'll only take what I need.

21:50.022 --> 21:52.663
Our friend gonna die 'less you help us.

22:18.742 --> 22:19.549
Okay.

22:19.602 --> 22:21.352
Thank you.

22:25.441 --> 22:26.807
Thank you.

22:34.567 --> 22:35.667
There you are.

22:36.382 --> 22:38.337
Allow me to introduce you to my brother.

22:39.288 --> 22:40.570
Mr. and Mrs. Jones...

22:42.040 --> 22:43.385
...Sheriff Cobb.

23:11.436 --> 23:13.122
They send you in here to do it?

23:15.441 --> 23:16.641
I asked.

23:21.614 --> 23:22.806
Got to do it right.

23:23.782 --> 23:25.915
Cut too deep, wound'll never heal.

23:25.951 --> 23:27.336
Hmm. Don't matter.

23:29.422 --> 23:31.602
I ain't never gonna
walk right again nohow.

23:36.461 --> 23:37.961
No, you ain't.

23:40.849 --> 23:42.967
But you still be alive.

23:45.137 --> 23:47.509
He looked at me like
I should be grateful for that.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.962
Like I should let him cut my
heels with a smile on my face.

23:52.394 --> 23:53.595
"Thank you, massa, for...

23:54.230 --> 23:55.961
turnin' me into a cripple."

24:02.872 --> 24:04.154
I'd rather be dead.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.451
Don't you talk like that.

24:08.294 --> 24:09.660
We gonna get through this.

24:09.711 --> 24:10.747
Together.

24:13.311 --> 24:15.289
We can survive anything.

24:19.221 --> 24:20.827
That's what I'm afraid of, Momma.

24:24.559 --> 24:25.675
Hmm.

24:45.580 --> 24:46.724
I'm ready.

25:48.703 --> 25:50.144
Stine, stop.

25:54.182 --> 25:55.148
We're not doing this.

25:55.183 --> 25:56.029
Tom...

25:56.065 --> 25:57.734
I'm not doing this.

26:29.424 --> 26:31.242
Henry, wait. Wait.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.128
Wait...

26:35.154 --> 26:36.296
Listen up, gentlemen.

26:36.298 --> 26:37.597
What is left of the Macon Seven

26:37.633 --> 26:39.133
is somewhere in this town.

26:39.184 --> 26:41.250
We've been on this hunt for weeks.

26:41.285 --> 26:42.718
Now is the time to end this.

26:43.355 --> 26:44.296
One of them's been shot,

26:44.330 --> 26:46.140
which means they haven't gotten far.

26:46.142 --> 26:48.269
I want a man on every road out of town.

26:48.371 --> 26:49.903
We're gonna go door to door,

26:49.905 --> 26:51.572
search every graveyard
and any other place

26:51.624 --> 26:53.156
these niggers might be hiding.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.959
Let's go get 'em.

27:00.421 --> 27:01.882
I need you to read this.

27:05.471 --> 27:06.708
It's a letter from the bank

27:06.743 --> 27:07.987
about your land.

27:09.474 --> 27:10.924
Says they found mercury on the property.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.013
Might be harmful
to your crop or livestock.

27:13.261 --> 27:15.229
They're willing to buy
it back at a premium.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.398
Premium?

27:18.433 --> 27:20.042
Don't let 'em fool you, August.

27:20.435 --> 27:22.102
Mercury's used to mine for gold.

27:22.104 --> 27:23.604
Probably get a whole hell of a lot more,

27:23.605 --> 27:25.105
you sell it to the highest bidder.

27:26.826 --> 27:28.659
Hell, if I would've known
you were a rich man, August,

27:28.693 --> 27:30.611
I never would have agreed on
lettin' you have that girl.

27:38.988 --> 27:40.621
Missus Jones was kind enough
to notice the effort

27:40.673 --> 27:43.039
I've put in to elevating
the decor of the house.

27:43.092 --> 27:43.958
Mmm.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.429
What happened to your face?

27:47.797 --> 27:49.697
An accident involving lye.

27:49.731 --> 27:51.346
Yes, I told you, he's a soap maker.

27:52.634 --> 27:54.050
What kind of soap?

27:54.973 --> 27:56.269
All kinds.

27:57.890 --> 27:58.807
Oh.

27:59.392 --> 28:00.807
You a quadroon?

28:01.678 --> 28:02.976
Brother, please don't be rude.

28:03.028 --> 28:04.644
No, it's all right.

28:04.911 --> 28:06.446
My father was a English boat captain,

28:06.481 --> 28:07.530
my mother

28:07.566 --> 28:10.150
a mulatto slave
he bought and later freed.

28:11.119 --> 28:12.486
Well, you're so well-spoken.

28:12.488 --> 28:13.820
If I didn't know better,

28:14.415 --> 28:16.824
I would've thought
you attended finishing school.

28:16.875 --> 28:19.326
Oh, well...

28:19.377 --> 28:21.377
I had private tutors.

28:21.413 --> 28:23.497
Needlework, etiquette, piano.

28:23.499 --> 28:24.798
Everything I would have learned

28:24.834 --> 28:27.667
if "quadroons" were
allowed to attend school.

28:28.971 --> 28:30.309
Piano?

28:31.173 --> 28:34.008
It's been so long since
we had music in this house.

28:34.009 --> 28:35.578
Not since our mother passed.

28:36.595 --> 28:37.592
Oh.

28:39.347 --> 28:41.097
Would you be so kind

28:41.150 --> 28:42.296
as to...

28:42.768 --> 28:44.518
play something for us?

28:50.660 --> 28:52.272
Why, I'd love to.

29:36.404 --> 29:39.990
This song reminds me of
my childhood friend Mary.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.490
We used to play it together.

30:04.650 --> 30:05.701
Ben!

30:06.885 --> 30:07.901
Get the horses ready.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.737
Make sure they're fed and watered.

30:09.771 --> 30:11.167
We going home?

30:25.336 --> 30:27.503
Lovely. Just lovely.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.510
Excuse me, I...

30:34.547 --> 30:37.463
I think I might have
something in my eye.

30:38.026 --> 30:39.298
Well, I gotta admit,

30:40.455 --> 30:41.300
you both seem

30:41.302 --> 30:43.470
too cultured to be slaves,

30:44.130 --> 30:45.972
but I don't believe in coincidences.

30:47.198 --> 30:48.307
I get word

30:48.309 --> 30:50.109
that a group of notorious runaways

30:50.145 --> 30:51.153
are in my town,

30:51.564 --> 30:55.949
and then I find my brother
has invited niggers to dinner.

30:58.319 --> 30:59.939
Show me your papers.

31:02.575 --> 31:03.826
Why didn't you ask?

31:04.951 --> 31:06.364
I got 'em right here.

31:14.836 --> 31:17.221
What seems to be the problem?

31:19.758 --> 31:21.008
There ain't one.

31:26.848 --> 31:28.603
Slide them on over.

31:44.834 --> 31:47.701
Sir. Somebody spotted
one of them runaways

31:47.702 --> 31:49.869
slip into Timothy
Coldwater's cane fields.

31:49.872 --> 31:51.371
Come on. Let's go.

31:53.765 --> 31:54.842
Go help Noah.

31:54.876 --> 31:56.259
I'll get the medicine.

32:28.941 --> 32:31.711
This ain't gonna come down
to one man's opinion.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.253
You're gonna go in there,

32:35.917 --> 32:37.469
do what you do.

32:38.804 --> 32:42.116
Make them see they'd be a fool
not to nominate you.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.814
Oh, Tim.

32:50.848 --> 32:52.516
Congratulations, sir. Thank you, sir.

32:52.567 --> 32:53.733
Best of luck. Tom Macon.

32:53.769 --> 32:54.768
Pleasure to meet you, Tom.
Pleasure meeting you.

32:54.769 --> 32:55.903
Niggers are childlike,

32:55.938 --> 32:57.186
in need of protection.

32:57.239 --> 32:59.323
Slavery provides a
civilizing influence. Mmm.

32:59.357 --> 33:01.741
Your Macon Seven is just another example

33:01.777 --> 33:04.076
that we must be diligent,
or we are gonna be sleeping

33:04.113 --> 33:06.779
with one eye open for
the rest of our lives.

33:06.781 --> 33:08.164
- Drapetomania.
- Hmm.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.616
It's a serious medical condition
the slaves suffer from.

33:10.618 --> 33:12.669
Uncontrollable urges to run away,

33:12.704 --> 33:14.871
answer disrespectfully and refuse work.

33:14.923 --> 33:16.748
We should talk about this more.

33:17.175 --> 33:18.431
Owning slaves is our

33:18.467 --> 33:19.922
most important liberty.

33:19.946 --> 33:21.107
The only cure for Drapetomania

33:21.133 --> 33:22.981
is severe whippings and hard labor

33:23.007 --> 33:24.666
to send vital blood to the brain.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.097
In a sense, they're freer than we.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.884
They breed like animals. There
are more of them than of us.

33:28.885 --> 33:30.804
We provide the slaves
with everything they ever need.

33:30.855 --> 33:32.355
If we do not instill

33:32.391 --> 33:34.441
the fear of God in each and every one,

33:34.476 --> 33:36.098
they will slit our throats

33:36.151 --> 33:38.228
and bathe this country in blood.

33:38.279 --> 33:40.113
I understand.

33:46.488 --> 33:47.903
If you get what you want,

33:47.957 --> 33:49.873
you will be tasked
with serving the desires

33:49.907 --> 33:51.875
of these men in this room.

33:51.910 --> 33:53.366
in the Senate.

33:53.878 --> 33:55.313
The only question remaining is...

33:55.830 --> 33:57.663
how badly do you want it?

34:29.947 --> 34:31.581
You seen Sam?

34:31.617 --> 34:32.833
No, ma'am.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.525
Henry?

35:22.275 --> 35:23.858
Where's that boy?

35:23.893 --> 35:25.693
He's in there somewhere.

35:25.730 --> 35:27.813
I stand before you

35:27.864 --> 35:29.208
a humbled man.

35:30.233 --> 35:31.583
Humbled by God.

35:32.402 --> 35:33.702
By your support.

35:34.728 --> 35:37.248
By the responsibility
I will be charged with.

35:39.010 --> 35:40.599
But what humbles me the most

35:41.766 --> 35:43.965
is what I look at when I peer ahead.

35:45.103 --> 35:47.018
I look in front of me and I see a chasm.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.306
A great divide,
tearing this country in half,

35:50.358 --> 35:52.503
north to south.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.695
You can ignore it.

35:56.731 --> 35:58.230
You can run from it.

36:00.068 --> 36:01.699
But we do so at our own peril,

36:01.735 --> 36:04.737
because it will swallow us whole.

36:04.789 --> 36:08.740
This nation looks at two paths.

36:08.793 --> 36:11.710
One will lead us to prosperity

36:11.746 --> 36:14.130
and a future where
our children's children

36:14.164 --> 36:15.664
will want for nothing.

36:15.666 --> 36:17.750
The other will lead us to ruin.

36:17.802 --> 36:19.603
Down a soulless path,

36:20.106 --> 36:21.670
away from our heritage.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.556
Away from our values.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.148
I see another divide.

36:28.679 --> 36:30.371
That's the one within us.

36:31.474 --> 36:32.931
That chasm between

36:32.983 --> 36:34.766
who we are

36:34.818 --> 36:36.568
and who we say we are.

36:37.394 --> 36:39.947
Are we who we say we are?

36:40.931 --> 36:42.746
That is the question
before all of us today.

36:42.797 --> 36:43.742
That is the question

36:43.777 --> 36:45.393
you've asked me to answer.

36:45.695 --> 36:47.195
You've got to keep fightin'.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.081
You've got to get the others to freedom.

36:49.117 --> 36:51.699
I say we are strong.

36:52.121 --> 36:54.253
I say we are uncompromising.

36:55.706 --> 36:58.173
I say we are the American South!

36:58.208 --> 37:00.960
And in order for the South
to persist, to thrive,

37:01.012 --> 37:03.179
we must cross that chasm within us

37:03.213 --> 37:05.780
and believe in the South,
whole-heartedly.

37:05.817 --> 37:07.099
We must be vigilant.

37:07.135 --> 37:09.768
Never compromising our heritage,

37:09.804 --> 37:11.219
or values...

37:11.222 --> 37:13.806
our very way of life!

37:13.858 --> 37:15.391
A war is coming.

37:15.443 --> 37:16.858
And only those of us

37:16.893 --> 37:18.277
who are fully committed

37:18.311 --> 37:19.777
will be left standing

37:19.813 --> 37:22.148
when the last shot is fired.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.079
I guess you didn't need my help.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.501
House girl's coming with some medicine.

38:27.264 --> 38:29.797
Got one of yours!

38:30.851 --> 38:32.710
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

38:33.804 --> 38:36.188
It ain't gonna help her
if we get caught, too.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.646
Ah, don't seem like they care to me.

38:44.699 --> 38:46.815
Well, a bullet in my
shoulder tells me otherwise.

38:48.568 --> 38:50.068
They're coming.

38:50.121 --> 38:53.655
And you and your boys,
you better be ready.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.239
I needed you today.

39:28.476 --> 39:30.943
Could I have stopped you
from lynching that man?

39:30.994 --> 39:31.875
You know...

39:32.954 --> 39:34.496
it's better to be the one with the rope

39:34.532 --> 39:36.282
than the one hanging from it.

39:38.572 --> 39:40.369
I never had legs
for standing on moral ground

39:40.371 --> 39:42.036
like you and Dad.
