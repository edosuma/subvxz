I'm glad we're
finally doing this.
So glad.

02:37.447 --> 02:40.755
Yeah, we were just saying
the same thing in the car.
Really? (laughs)

02:40.755 --> 02:42.457

Mm. It's all Roger.
Mm‐hmm.

02:58.456 --> 03:00.627
He's become obsessed
with frittatas.

03:00.627 --> 03:01.830
What is it
you keep saying, honey?

03:01.830 --> 03:04.468
The frittata
is like a quiche...

03:04.468 --> 03:06.907
With the personality
of a pizza.

03:06.907 --> 03:07.641
(both laughing)

03:07.641 --> 03:09.411
I've never
heard you say that.

03:09.411 --> 03:10.948
That's because
it'd be lost on you.

03:10.948 --> 03:14.488
Oh. Oh, 'cause I can't
appreciate a good frittata?

03:14.488 --> 03:16.492
Well, that's a pancake.

03:16.492 --> 03:19.365
You are eating a pancake
and calling it a frittata.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.502
(laughter)

03:21.502 --> 03:24.575
Look, while I can appreciate
a meal

03:24.575 --> 03:26.747
that encompasses
both breakfast and lunch,

03:26.747 --> 03:28.751
I just want to know
what this is,

03:28.751 --> 03:30.120

doing here?

civilized adults do.

03:33.459 --> 03:34.996
Mm.
Martin is our good friend.

03:34.996 --> 03:36.767
Our good friend has
met a new friend,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.871
and I think we should get
to know each other.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.075
Right? It's how
the world gets bigger, baby.

03:41.075 --> 03:43.680
Yeah, Rog, it's how
the world gets bigger.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.550
You got a problem with that?

03:45.550 --> 03:46.652
PALMER:
I'm personally thrilled

03:46.652 --> 03:47.721
that we're doing this.

03:47.721 --> 03:49.391
Going back and
forth to D. C.,

03:49.391 --> 03:50.761
my schedule is crazy.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.397
Oh, it's got nothing
to do with your schedule.

03:52.397 --> 03:54.101
She can only spend two
or three days with me,

03:54.101 --> 03:55.805
then she's got to get
the heck out of Dodge.

03:55.805 --> 03:57.441
(laughs)
MURTAUGH:
Treat Riggs

03:57.441 --> 03:58.443
like a vacation.

03:58.443 --> 04:00.180
Genius. I wish
I would have thought of that.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.384
PALMER: Well, it is kind
of like a vacation.

04:02.384 --> 04:04.455
Although, like, six months
at a time, it would be...

04:04.455 --> 04:05.724
Is that a possibility?

04:05.724 --> 04:07.427
You know, my supervisor

04:07.427 --> 04:09.098
keeps floating the idea around,

04:09.098 --> 04:10.500
so...

04:10.500 --> 04:12.070
He does?

04:12.070 --> 04:14.008
(laughs)
Riggs just choked
on his frittata.
No.

04:14.008 --> 04:15.143
Stop.
RIGGS:
I‐I think

04:15.143 --> 04:17.080
it's a great idea.
I think it would be interesting,

04:17.080 --> 04:19.786
you know, to be down
at the, um...

04:19.786 --> 04:21.489
down at the beach
together, you know?

04:21.489 --> 04:25.430
Well, I'm‐I'm... Did he just
ask me to move in with him?

04:25.430 --> 04:26.967
I think so. Yeah.
That's what it sounds like.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.904
No, I'm not...
You did, right?
Just go on record.

04:28.904 --> 04:30.073
Shut up. That's not what I...
I heard it.

04:30.073 --> 04:32.177
Brunch just took a turn.
I'm not in... I was just saying,

04:32.177 --> 04:33.346
that I'm... Look.

Just saying.
It's gonna be fun to have you...

Oh, got to go.

Okay.

04:42.164 --> 04:43.666
Mwah.
Bye.

04:43.666 --> 04:46.605
All right.

04:46.605 --> 04:48.643
Um...

04:48.643 --> 04:51.549
You‐you... Would you like to go?
You want to...?

04:51.549 --> 04:53.553
You interested in,
like, tagging along, or...?

04:53.553 --> 04:54.856
I'm still on vacation.

04:54.856 --> 04:56.659
But you have fun,
and let me know

04:56.659 --> 04:58.864
if you see any drugs
or anything weird.

04:58.864 --> 05:00.567
It's already weird.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.435
Very weird.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.843
RIGGS: All right,
what do we got?

05:04.843 --> 05:08.416
BAILEY:
Her bodyguard was killed, but it
looks like Shaye was the target.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.819
MURTAUGH:
Shaye? You mean like

05:09.819 --> 05:10.988
<i>Shaye</i> Shaye?
Who's Shaye?

05:10.988 --> 05:13.493
She was lucky. She walked
away with barely a scratch.

05:13.493 --> 05:16.499
Forensics, air bag deployment,
and the guy's pants indicate

05:16.499 --> 05:18.436
they were fooling around
in the back seat.

05:18.436 --> 05:19.873
So is this like, uh,

05:19.873 --> 05:21.943
Shea Stadium? Che Guevera?
Who are we...?

05:21.943 --> 05:24.681
Who are we
talking about?
We're talking
Shaye, the pop star, man.

05:24.681 --> 05:26.619
She has that song,
"Broken Window."

05:26.619 --> 05:27.989
"Shattered Glass."
Yeah, and...

05:27.989 --> 05:29.725
and‐and she had
the other hit song.

05:29.725 --> 05:31.695
"Pop! Pop! Pop!"
MAN:
Active shooter!

05:32.497 --> 05:34.234
Oh. (laughs)

05:34.234 --> 05:36.472
...is the name of Shaye's song.
Whoa.

05:36.472 --> 05:38.009
Honest misunderstanding, but

05:38.009 --> 05:39.111
awesome response time.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.682
Step back
behind the tape.
Who the hell are you?

05:41.682 --> 05:42.852
Uh, Detective
Bowman.

05:42.852 --> 05:44.021
I transferred
this morning.

05:44.021 --> 05:45.657
The deputy chief
sent me here.

05:45.657 --> 05:46.525
Is that soup?

05:46.525 --> 05:48.663
Yeah, yeah,
I've got, uh, minestrone

05:48.663 --> 05:49.531
and, uh, split pea.

05:49.531 --> 05:51.502
Why?
'Cause soup
makes people happy.

05:51.502 --> 05:53.639
It's like my thing, you know,
first day at a new gig?

05:53.639 --> 05:55.143
Hit 'em with soup.
No.

05:55.143 --> 05:57.047
Why did the deputy chief
send you here?

05:57.047 --> 06:00.286
No clue. Maybe 'cause she wants
me to learn from the best.

06:00.286 --> 06:02.090
Ooh, I'm gonna do
the minestrone.
Split pea.

06:02.090 --> 06:03.559
You guys really
are doing the soup?

06:03.559 --> 06:05.663
What? This is
a great idea.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.100
Soup to a crime scene?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.638
You know, most people do
coffee, donuts, bagels.

06:09.638 --> 06:12.210
This guy‐‐ soup.
That's new.

06:12.210 --> 06:14.983
I wasn't able to
finish brunch, so...

06:14.983 --> 06:16.518
You need
to get on board, Rog.

06:16.518 --> 06:17.554
Ooh, idea man.

06:17.554 --> 06:19.157
Keep up the good work, Slim.

06:19.157 --> 06:20.727
Cool.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.705
I know your face from somewhere.

06:26.705 --> 06:29.011
(laughs nervously)
Soup?

06:33.619 --> 06:36.492
Got my eye on you, Bowman.

06:44.007 --> 06:46.178
(pop music plays quietly
in the background)

06:46.178 --> 06:48.783
So what exactly
happened last night?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.186
Michael was driving me home.

06:50.186 --> 06:52.857
There were gunshots, we crashed.

06:52.857 --> 06:55.830
How many times do you need me
to keep telling the same story?

06:55.830 --> 06:59.137
Well, we're hoping you can
provide some additional details.

06:59.137 --> 07:01.542
RIGGS:
Like you were
sleeping with him

07:01.542 --> 07:02.610
when the crash happened.

07:02.610 --> 07:03.846
That's a good detail.

07:03.846 --> 07:05.917
Uh, please don't touch that.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.287
That's not a toy.

07:07.287 --> 07:08.489
That was Bob Marley's guitar.

07:08.489 --> 07:12.831
Hmm.
Really? Bob? I hear
some Marley in your, uh, work.

07:12.831 --> 07:15.036
Oh, really?
Uh, which album?

07:17.140 --> 07:18.642
I'm not... I'm not
really good

07:18.642 --> 07:20.646
with names.
Shaye?
Phil,

07:20.646 --> 07:22.584
this is a waste of my time.
I have a session to get to.

07:22.584 --> 07:24.588
It's canceled. Sweetie,
you need to take a break.

07:24.588 --> 07:25.656
What I need is for people

07:25.656 --> 07:27.660
to stop telling me
what I need.

07:27.660 --> 07:29.765
Phil Green.
I manage Shaye.

07:29.765 --> 07:32.570
How's it going here?
Oh, it's going
kind of slow, Phil.

07:32.570 --> 07:35.076
So, we know you were sleeping
with the bodyguard.

07:35.076 --> 07:37.347
Is there maybe an angry
boyfriend, or, like,

07:37.347 --> 07:40.620
an angry wife? Can you think of
any other angry stuff that...?
PHIL: Wow.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.127
Are there other, maybe
more sensitive detectives

07:44.127 --> 07:45.663
who can deal
with this?

07:45.663 --> 07:47.133
No. Cream of the crop.
We're the best.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.369
SHAYE:
Ray's a lot of things,

07:48.369 --> 07:50.273
but he's no killer. We're
going through a rough patch

07:50.273 --> 07:52.677
right now, but he didn't
know about Michael.

07:52.677 --> 07:53.846
RIGGS:
All right.

07:53.846 --> 07:55.883
So, where he was last night?
Know where we can find him?

07:55.883 --> 07:58.622
He was at work, as usual.

07:58.622 --> 08:00.793
As usual.
All right.

08:00.793 --> 08:02.330
I'll go with you.

08:02.330 --> 08:03.933
He left me, like,
20 messages.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.336
Nah, it's okay.
We'll handle it.
Yeah.

08:05.336 --> 08:07.574
Okay, then I'm going
to the studio.
Shaye,

08:07.574 --> 08:09.744
you deserve
a day off.

08:09.744 --> 08:12.784
Artists.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.020
(wine pouring)

08:14.020 --> 08:16.091
Oh, it was like a cage match.
It was so bad.

08:16.091 --> 08:19.331
We were just tearing into each
other at the end there like...

08:19.331 --> 08:21.335
Wow.
...like we decided
we couldn't leave the marriage

08:21.335 --> 08:23.172
until we were both
completely unfit

08:23.172 --> 08:25.276
to ever be with another human
ever again.
Gosh.

08:25.276 --> 08:27.714
It sounds brutal.
Yeah, it was.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.784
But, see, that's the beauty
of Riggs, right?

08:29.784 --> 08:35.663
We are both pretty incapable of
a lot, so, it's pretty perfect.

08:35.663 --> 08:38.702
Can I offer

08:38.702 --> 08:40.740
a suggestion?

08:40.740 --> 08:42.410
(sighs)

08:42.410 --> 08:47.253
Riggs has been to this house
for maybe 100 meals.

08:47.253 --> 08:51.895
And I think this is the first
time he ever washed his hair.

08:51.895 --> 08:54.834
I'm so sorry.
That's awful.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.309
No. I'm just...
(sighs)

08:58.309 --> 09:01.348
I'm just saying
that if you do feel

09:01.348 --> 09:03.886
that you're cut out
for something else,

09:03.886 --> 09:06.858
he might surprise you.

09:09.731 --> 09:11.735
(classical music playing)

09:16.010 --> 09:17.313
So I'm checking
in with Trish.

09:17.313 --> 09:20.119
You want me to tell her
to let Palmer know

09:20.119 --> 09:21.855
we're still out
on this thing?

09:21.855 --> 09:23.158
Huh? No.

09:23.158 --> 09:24.861
Oh, you already
checked in?

09:24.861 --> 09:26.698
Why would I do that?

09:26.698 --> 09:28.702
Because it's
what you do.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.808
We left brunch early,
so you got to check in

09:31.808 --> 09:33.712
and let her know that
we're still on this thing.

09:33.712 --> 09:38.856
But she knows I'm still out
because I'm not there.

09:38.856 --> 09:40.459
Rog, do you honestly believe

09:40.459 --> 09:42.764
that Trish thinks
you're at the house right now?

09:42.764 --> 09:45.736
No, of course not.

09:45.736 --> 09:48.976
Because I checked in.

09:51.815 --> 09:54.821
You have no clue how
relationships work, do you?

09:55.923 --> 09:57.827
I'm looking for Ray!

09:57.827 --> 09:59.497
LAPD. Anybody where I can...?
Yeah.

09:59.497 --> 10:02.437
Hi. He's in the back, prepping
the maid of honor, okay?

10:03.739 --> 10:05.342
All right.

10:05.342 --> 10:07.847
It's actually called
the check‐in.

10:07.847 --> 10:10.886

10:19.671 --> 10:21.541

What the hell? Ray?
Ray, you in here?

10:21.541 --> 10:23.979
WOMAN:
Where... where's my dress?

10:23.979 --> 10:26.117

Get back, get back.

10:27.153 --> 10:28.989
RAY: Oh.
(chuckles)
Wow.

10:28.989 --> 10:31.561
It's quite the
prep process.
Just working.

10:31.561 --> 10:32.897
Oh.

10:32.897 --> 10:34.267
Well, clearly,
and you're naked,

10:34.267 --> 10:36.171
and that's how most
of the great

10:36.171 --> 10:37.974
photographers did it‐‐
in the nude.

10:37.974 --> 10:38.909
Really?
Yes, to

10:38.909 --> 10:40.279
relax the models
in the nude.

10:40.279 --> 10:41.214
RIGGS: Oh, wow.
Well, here's the thing.

10:41.214 --> 10:43.452
We need to, uh,
ask you some questions about

10:43.452 --> 10:44.988
(whispering):
...your girlfriend.

10:44.988 --> 10:46.925
Girlfriend?
You jerk!

10:46.925 --> 10:48.428
Now, hold on.
I can explain.

10:48.428 --> 10:50.499
Yeah, she was almost killed
last night.

10:50.499 --> 10:53.939
Yes. I heard.
I... I was horrified.

10:53.939 --> 10:55.074
He was horrified.

10:55.074 --> 10:56.344
Horrified.

10:56.344 --> 10:58.215
All right, so,
where were you last night, Ray?

10:58.215 --> 11:00.084
Uh, last night I was with her,

11:00.084 --> 11:01.288
uh, at the
rehearsal dinner

11:01.288 --> 11:02.957
taking photos.
SHAYE:
You weren't working!

11:02.957 --> 11:04.460
You lowlife,

11:04.460 --> 11:06.464

Shaye, oh, my God,

11:06.464 --> 11:09.270

Oh, my God,
were you so worried, Ray?

11:09.270 --> 11:11.908
Who is she,
your grief counselor?
I‐I... (grunts)

11:11.908 --> 11:14.480
She can't do that.
(groans)

11:14.480 --> 11:16.318
No, Shaye...
Let go of me!

11:16.318 --> 11:18.222
Little help here, Rog.
I love you.
I tried calling you.

11:18.222 --> 11:19.290
Oh, was that while
you were banging her,

11:19.290 --> 11:21.026
or did you wait
till after?
I love you, Shaye.

11:21.026 --> 11:22.062

RAY (groaning):
Aw, God...

11:30.379 --> 11:32.015
You're right, Rog.

11:32.015 --> 11:34.287
Relationships
are complicated.

11:34.287 --> 11:35.489
Huh.

to put that on.

11:47.213 --> 11:49.217
In our defense, there are risks
to having outdoor weddings.

11:49.217 --> 11:51.120
This is true‐‐ anything could
have fallen on that cake.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.425
Including the naked man
you tossed off the balcony.

11:53.425 --> 11:55.061
We didn't toss him
off the balcony.

11:55.061 --> 11:57.300
Did we toss him
off the balcony?
Is Avery around?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.202
He has a way
of giving feedback

11:59.202 --> 12:02.142
that's more like a...
a compliment sandwich.

12:02.142 --> 12:04.414
Let me explain. You take
a slice of compliment...
Mm‐hmm.

12:04.414 --> 12:06.050
...you fill it with
your ham and cheese,

12:06.050 --> 12:07.118
which is your
constructive criticism,

12:07.118 --> 12:09.958

with another compliment.

down a lead.

you two how to be led.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.464

the best way to avoid
those kind of bruises

17:37.345 --> 17:40.217
is to avoid the guys
who are giving them to you.

17:41.453 --> 17:43.825
Yeah.

17:43.825 --> 17:47.231
Well, in my experience...

17:47.231 --> 17:50.337
the guy giving them to you knows
you <i>can't</i> avoid him,

17:50.337 --> 17:53.510
because your
whole life, career,

17:53.510 --> 17:56.349
whole world depends on him.

17:56.349 --> 17:57.819

27:00.937 --> 27:01.872
Yeah.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.976
You... are
a great agent.

27:03.976 --> 27:06.415
I'll call you later.
(clears throat)

27:07.984 --> 27:09.888
(door opens)

27:09.888 --> 27:11.692
(door closes)

27:18.973 --> 27:20.443
MURTAUGH:
Who is he?

27:20.443 --> 27:23.182
No idea.
Really? 'Cause
it looks like

27:23.182 --> 27:25.920
you ushered Shaye
out of the room to avoid him.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.791
And yet,
he really seems to know you.

27:27.791 --> 27:29.026
Hey, where's Shaye?

27:29.026 --> 27:30.863
Keep this guy away
from me. Look,

27:30.863 --> 27:32.433
see, I got witnesses
this time.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.235
Look, would you just...

27:33.235 --> 27:35.071
How about this?
Take a shot at me.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.408
And then we're
even, right?

27:36.408 --> 27:38.044
No, come on,
nobody's gonna do that.

27:38.044 --> 27:41.885
Did you really have
to hire private security?

27:41.885 --> 27:44.825
Well, we're
not comfortable
with the LAPD.

27:44.825 --> 27:45.760
SHAYE:
What is going on?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.695
Sweetie, you don't
need to be here...

27:46.695 --> 27:47.764
Shut up. Shut up.
It's more harassment.

27:47.764 --> 27:51.037
I swear to...
This is from
two weeks ago at Boyle.

27:58.319 --> 28:00.289
Phil.

28:00.289 --> 28:03.329
I told you we've
never seen him before.

28:05.165 --> 28:06.902
Shaye.

28:08.137 --> 28:10.276
I've never seen him before.

28:14.016 --> 28:16.221
Look, someone wants you dead.

28:16.221 --> 28:18.893
Let us help you.

28:18.893 --> 28:20.061
I'm sorry.

28:21.365 --> 28:24.003
I don't know him.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.306
We're done.

28:25.306 --> 28:27.977
Next time you come
to this house,

28:27.977 --> 28:29.113
have a warrant.

28:29.113 --> 28:32.954
All right, we're walkin'.
We're walkin', Riggs.

28:32.954 --> 28:34.257
My guys'll show you out.

28:36.361 --> 28:37.330
Don't push it.

28:42.307 --> 28:45.145
I ran it through LAPD's
facial recognition protocol.

28:45.145 --> 28:46.147
Nothing.

28:46.147 --> 28:48.352
Yeah, I've never
seen him before.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.090
In addition, Detective Bowman
also doesn't recognize him.

28:51.090 --> 28:53.094
(chuckles):
Oh, you're saying
it's a computer thing.

28:53.094 --> 28:55.933
Yeah, I thought you were
asking if <i>I'd</i> seen him before.

28:55.933 --> 28:57.035
No.

28:58.171 --> 29:01.043
Yeah, I've got it now.

29:01.912 --> 29:04.016
Riggs is calling in a favor

29:04.016 --> 29:06.187
to get us
into a federal database.

29:07.957 --> 29:10.028
What's our guy doing
right there?

29:10.028 --> 29:12.099
Look at his hand.

29:12.099 --> 29:13.402
Bailey, play that back.

29:15.373 --> 29:17.075
Bam. Right there.

29:17.075 --> 29:19.079
He's paying for a drink
with his credit card.

29:19.079 --> 29:21.351
There's a name
on that receipt.

29:21.351 --> 29:23.489
(whispers): I think
you should turn it off.

29:23.489 --> 29:26.395
Bowman, please.
You have a genius at work.

29:26.395 --> 29:29.166
And so modest, too.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.039
Hey...
Hey.

29:32.039 --> 29:34.209
This is... a great...

29:34.209 --> 29:35.346
surprise.
Mm‐hmm.

29:35.346 --> 29:37.283
Sorry to interrupt
you at work, but...

29:37.283 --> 29:39.153
I guess it runs
in the family.

29:39.153 --> 29:42.059
Ha. Good... Got it.

29:42.059 --> 29:43.395
Good one, good one.
(laughs)

29:43.395 --> 29:46.100
Listen, I'm sorry for
snapping at you earlier.

29:46.100 --> 29:49.073
So purely out
of guilt...

29:49.073 --> 29:51.411
I got you the security...

29:53.615 --> 29:56.287
What is that on the TV?

29:57.957 --> 29:59.093
Oh...

29:59.093 --> 30:01.097
that's a... a screen saver.

30:01.097 --> 30:02.934
Mm. Roger, I'm confused.

30:02.934 --> 30:06.374
'Cause I remember an attorney
who looks a lot like me

30:06.374 --> 30:09.347
telling you you need a
subpoena for that video.

30:11.217 --> 30:13.221
Would you care to respond?

30:13.221 --> 30:14.357
Yes.

30:14.357 --> 30:16.260
But before I do,

30:16.260 --> 30:19.467
what are the chances
that we could look at a receipt

30:19.467 --> 30:21.303
from the credit card
at that restaurant?

30:21.303 --> 30:23.709
Bailey, can you
give us the room?

30:23.709 --> 30:25.145
Thank you. Give us...?

30:25.145 --> 30:26.481
Thank you.

30:29.186 --> 30:30.523
(exhales)

30:32.527 --> 30:34.364
(phone ringing)

30:37.703 --> 30:39.173
Hey.

30:39.173 --> 30:41.344
I was just about to call you.
Yeah?

30:41.344 --> 30:42.680
Oh, good. Okay, I'm sorry.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.216
I was scared it was just me.

30:44.216 --> 30:46.320
(chuckles): Um, I started
to feel like a freak

30:46.320 --> 30:48.024
for wanting to talk about,

30:48.024 --> 30:49.661
you know...

30:49.661 --> 30:51.096
Right.

30:51.096 --> 30:52.232
Uh, me, too.

30:52.232 --> 30:54.236
Yeah, how we left stuff earlier.

30:54.236 --> 30:55.472
That's weird.

30:55.472 --> 30:57.677
Right, yes.

30:57.677 --> 30:58.545
Exac... Yes,

30:58.545 --> 31:00.749
that is exactly
why I was calling you.

31:00.749 --> 31:02.587
(clears throat)
Okay.

31:02.587 --> 31:05.392
So that is clearly
<i>not</i> why you called.

31:05.392 --> 31:08.264
Hey, Palmer,
you don't know that.

31:08.264 --> 31:10.235
What is this,
like, a work thing?

31:10.235 --> 31:13.307
Oh, maybe I'm calling you
for a variety of reasons,

31:13.307 --> 31:14.744
uh, one of which could be...

31:14.744 --> 31:16.280
Riggs, why are you calling?

31:16.280 --> 31:17.583
(clears throat)
Okay, fine.

31:17.583 --> 31:18.885
If I send you a photo,

31:18.885 --> 31:23.060
can you run it through the DEA's
facial recognition database?

31:23.060 --> 31:24.464
Also...

31:24.464 --> 31:26.601
if you would like
to talk about...

31:26.601 --> 31:28.739
Just send me the photo.

31:28.739 --> 31:30.074
All right.

31:30.074 --> 31:31.243
(clears throat)

31:31.243 --> 31:33.214
(quietly):
Okay.

31:38.324 --> 31:39.393
(ringtone plays)

31:39.393 --> 31:40.496
Hello?

31:40.496 --> 31:42.332
Bobby Claypool.

31:42.332 --> 31:43.669
Ex‐con that just got out.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.739
Do you know him?

31:45.739 --> 31:46.975
No,

31:46.975 --> 31:49.313
I‐I don't know...
Shaye, this guy
gets out of prison,

31:49.313 --> 31:51.451
and the first thing he does
is come after you.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.422
Phil said he was
gonna take care of...

31:53.422 --> 31:55.426
What? That he's
gonna protect you?

31:55.426 --> 31:56.594
He can't, Shaye.

31:56.594 --> 31:59.434
Now, listen,
who is Bobby Claypool?

31:59.434 --> 32:01.504
(exhales)
He was my first boyfriend.

32:01.504 --> 32:04.276
We were together
when I was starting out.

32:04.276 --> 32:06.413
So why is he after you?

32:08.552 --> 32:11.791
He went to prison
for vehicular manslaughter.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.361
Who did he kill?

32:14.664 --> 32:16.367
No one.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.339
Bobby didn't kill anyone.

32:19.339 --> 32:20.476
I did.

32:22.278 --> 32:23.849
Hang up the phone, Shaye.

32:23.849 --> 32:25.452
Shaye, is that Phil?
Do not hang up this phone.

32:25.452 --> 32:27.355
PHIL:
Get off the phone.

32:27.355 --> 32:28.525
Shaye, do not hang up the phone.

32:28.525 --> 32:30.161
Now!
Shaye.

Hey, I can't talk right now,

Everything all right?
Dad, do you know what's
going on with Shaye?

33:19.259 --> 33:21.731
Do I know? Do you know
what's going on with Shaye?

33:21.731 --> 33:24.236
I'm watching ShayeNation's
live Periscope.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.672
The thing we put on your phone
the other day.

33:25.672 --> 33:28.277
Open it now. You have to.

33:28.277 --> 33:30.414
Look at us.

33:30.414 --> 33:32.485
Just like old times.

33:32.485 --> 33:35.157
Bobby, don't.
Don't do this.

Oh, come on. Put your
peddle to the metal.

33:49.554 --> 33:51.456
(screaming, car horn honking)

33:53.327 --> 33:55.364
That was a close one.

33:55.364 --> 33:56.568
That brings me back.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.470
Now that reminds me
of a story.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.941
Now, stop me if you've
heard this one before,

33:59.941 --> 34:01.811
but I'm pretty sure
you haven't.

34:01.811 --> 34:03.648
Shaye kept it to herself.

<i>East on Mulholland.</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

34:06.688 --> 34:08.290
We're going the wrong way.

34:08.290 --> 34:10.629

the 3000 block.
All right.

<i>It was a drive just like this.</i>

34:18.444 --> 34:20.247
We were out celebrating.

34:20.247 --> 34:21.483
Shaye was behind the wheel.

34:21.483 --> 34:23.822
Do you remember what
we were celebrating, baby?

34:23.822 --> 34:25.792
Sure you do.

34:25.792 --> 34:27.228
Your first record deal.

34:27.228 --> 34:29.232

34:29.232 --> 34:31.203
Well, she killed a man
that night.

34:31.203 --> 34:34.242
Didn't see him
before we hit him.

34:34.242 --> 34:36.546
Isn't that right?
Yes.

34:36.546 --> 34:39.620
BOBBY:
But who went to jail for it?

34:39.620 --> 34:41.556
You did.

34:41.556 --> 34:42.525
Why?

34:42.525 --> 34:43.862
Tell them!

34:43.862 --> 34:45.297
Because we made a deal.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.936
Because you were supposed
to take care of me.

34:47.936 --> 34:50.241
Five years,

34:50.241 --> 34:52.278
not one visit

34:52.278 --> 34:54.315
I wanted to reach
out. I tried.

34:54.315 --> 34:55.551
Phil wouldn't let me.

34:55.551 --> 34:59.259
That's why he's
gonna die, too.

35:05.839 --> 35:08.477
Nice try.

37:15.966 --> 37:17.736
Yeah, now, that is
a guarantee.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.040
Maybe today, you know,
maybe later down the road.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.543
It's not an act, is it?

37:21.543 --> 37:22.879

It all depends on you.

37:22.879 --> 37:24.682

doesn't it?

37:28.891 --> 37:30.862

Yes or no?

Pull up!

37:35.939 --> 37:37.541
Answer the question.

37:37.541 --> 37:39.880
Yes. Yes, I hurt her.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.385
I did. I hurt her.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.622
Tell her I'm sorry.

37:45.992 --> 37:47.728
Tell her yourself.

(metal clattering)

38:15.150 --> 38:16.619
Is this your doing?

38:16.619 --> 38:18.991
It was a team effort.

38:18.991 --> 38:20.694
I think I created
the perfect cop.

38:20.694 --> 38:22.531
Your brains, his body.

38:22.531 --> 38:23.935
Mm‐hmm. Well,
you take your partner

38:23.935 --> 38:25.104
and you teach him
some paperwork.

38:25.104 --> 38:26.139
That's right.

38:26.139 --> 38:27.708
He's all yours now.

38:29.412 --> 38:31.116
SANTOS:
Apparently,

38:31.116 --> 38:33.453
our recruiting numbers are
suddenly through the roof.

38:33.453 --> 38:34.857
Hmm. You laugh.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.593
But a couple of tweaks

38:36.593 --> 38:38.096
and that's a very
compelling poster.

38:38.096 --> 38:40.467
You saved the girl's life.

38:40.467 --> 38:42.438
It was haphazard
police work.

38:42.438 --> 38:47.047
Excessive collateral damage,
and nearly a lawsuit, but...

38:47.047 --> 38:48.617
not a bad outcome.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.989
Now, that's a proper
compliment sandwich.

38:50.989 --> 38:53.460
Yeah, you closed it up.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.662
Listen.

38:54.662 --> 38:56.901
Any chance
you retire early

38:56.901 --> 38:58.036
and take Riggs with you?

38:58.036 --> 39:00.007
I can't leave.

39:00.007 --> 39:02.077

39:32.771 --> 39:34.742

I fired Phil.

39:34.742 --> 39:39.920

You see your dad on

40:06.907 --> 40:10.080
(chuckles softly)
Periscope, Twitter, TMZ.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.551
I've been getting texts
about you all night.
Really?

40:12.551 --> 40:14.588
Mm‐hmm.
Are they saying
how heroic I looked?

40:14.588 --> 40:16.292
'Cause that's what
they say down...
No.

40:16.292 --> 40:18.330
They're saying "Your dad

Hmm. Not at all.

Those of us not in your
daughter's demographic

40:45.751 --> 40:47.287
You should see me

40:47.287 --> 40:50.193
Poster? What?
I got big chest, big arms, yep.

40:50.193 --> 40:52.197
I get to sleep

Mm‐hmm.

40:52.197 --> 40:53.968

Hmm.

Way upstairs.

41:02.785 --> 41:04.221
Yeah. Come here.

Hey. I'm right by the hotel.

41:13.206 --> 41:15.110
PALMER (over phone): Oh,
I should've called you earlier.

41:15.110 --> 41:18.249
I'm about halfway
to the airport already.

41:18.249 --> 41:19.652
Oh, bummer.

41:19.652 --> 41:21.823
Well, I was gonna pick you up

41:21.823 --> 41:24.195
and see if you wanted
to grab a burger,

41:24.195 --> 41:26.332
and then, I'd give you
a lift to the airport.

41:26.332 --> 41:28.203
No worries, it's my fault.

41:28.203 --> 41:30.207
Murtaugh told me
I should've called.

41:30.207 --> 41:33.012
Well, I decided to take
an earlier flight.

41:33.012 --> 41:35.817
(horns honking over phone)

41:35.817 --> 41:37.921
(horns honking)

41:41.395 --> 41:43.066
So, when you coming back?

41:43.066 --> 41:46.739
Um, I don't know.

41:46.739 --> 41:48.843
Might be a while, huh?

41:48.843 --> 41:51.315
Yeah. Uh‐‐ look, um...

41:51.315 --> 41:55.757
when you left the hotel
the other day,

41:55.757 --> 41:57.227
that bothered me.

41:59.398 --> 42:02.070
I know. And I'm sorry.

42:02.070 --> 42:04.341
No, um, what I'm...

42:04.341 --> 42:06.879
what I'm trying to say is...

42:06.879 --> 42:09.051
thank you. Um...

42:09.051 --> 42:11.222
I really did not think
that I was capable

42:11.222 --> 42:14.862
of anyone bothering me anymore.

42:14.862 --> 42:17.401
Or that I would want them to.

42:17.401 --> 42:19.138
And it turns out,

42:19.138 --> 42:21.175
I do.

42:21.175 --> 42:23.379
You know?
It's... it's so stupid.

42:23.379 --> 42:25.917
It's like I want a guy
that sits around

42:25.917 --> 42:30.226
and watches dumb TV with me and
will talk about his feelings,

42:30.226 --> 42:33.733
brings me flowers,
all that dorky stuff.

42:33.733 --> 42:35.870
That's not you.

42:37.174 --> 42:40.347
And I would really hate anybody

42:40.347 --> 42:44.188
that tried to change you
into that guy.

42:45.957 --> 42:48.096
You and me both.

42:51.469 --> 42:53.940
Thank you, Riggs.

42:53.940 --> 42:57.414
You please take care
of yourself, okay?

42:57.414 --> 42:58.950
You too, Palmer.
