02:09:54.592 --> 02:09:55.559
There's the formality.

02:09:55.626 --> 02:09:56.559
Yes.

02:09:56.627 --> 02:09:57.594
Please stop moving.

02:09:57.662 --> 02:09:58.754
Strange formality.

02:09:58.829 --> 02:10:00.092
Why do you worry about it?

02:10:00.164 --> 02:10:01.222
'Cause I'm his father.

02:10:01.298 --> 02:10:02.959
You know what
he started doing?

02:10:03.034 --> 02:10:04.832
He started
shaking hands with me.

02:10:04.902 --> 02:10:05.835
He's 9.

02:10:05.903 --> 02:10:07.337
You'll see when he comes
by tomorrow.

02:10:07.405 --> 02:10:08.895
He'll be like..."Hi, Dad."

02:10:08.973 --> 02:10:10.566
-- What is that?
-- Leave him alone.

02:10:10.641 --> 02:10:11.802
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.</i>

02:10:11.876 --> 02:10:13.366
<i>First team in the studio,
please.</i>

02:10:13.444 --> 02:10:16.470
On the other hand, he's started
playing baseball well.

02:10:16.547 --> 02:10:17.480
Yes.

02:10:17.548 --> 02:10:18.845
Did I mention
yesterday's game?

02:10:18.916 --> 02:10:19.906
Yes, you did.

02:10:19.984 --> 02:10:21.315
In fact, I believe
I know the stats.

02:10:21.385 --> 02:10:24.116
3 for 3 with 2 RBIs, 2 walks,
and a stolen base.

02:10:24.188 --> 02:10:25.383
Yes.

02:10:25.456 --> 02:10:27.151
Well, you don't think
that's impressive?

02:10:27.224 --> 02:10:28.817
I think
it's very impressive.

02:10:28.893 --> 02:10:30.088
You bet your butt
that's impressive.

02:10:30.161 --> 02:10:31.094
It is.

02:10:31.162 --> 02:10:32.220
He started off slow,

02:10:32.296 --> 02:10:34.060
but it turns out
he's got some game.

02:10:34.131 --> 02:10:35.064
He does.

02:10:35.132 --> 02:10:36.156
You're done.

02:10:36.233 --> 02:10:37.758
My boy can play ball.

02:10:37.835 --> 02:10:40.031
I'd think about taking him
out of school.

02:10:40.104 --> 02:10:41.037
See, you joke about this.

02:10:41.105 --> 02:10:42.436
I'm not kidding.

02:10:42.506 --> 02:10:44.099
There's nothing he can
learn in fourth grade

02:10:44.175 --> 02:10:46.166
that he can't pick up in a good
minor league farm system.

02:10:46.243 --> 02:10:50.009
3 for 3 with 2 RBIs, 2 walks,
and a stolen base.

02:10:50.081 --> 02:10:52.015
You should be his agent, 'cause
that usually works out well, too.

02:10:52.083 --> 02:10:53.016
I'm just saying.

02:10:53.084 --> 02:10:54.848
Wouldn't you think she'd have
come crawling back to me by now?

02:10:54.919 --> 02:10:55.852
-- Rebecca?
-- Yes.

02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:57.012
I would have thought so,

02:10:57.088 --> 02:10:58.214
but instead, she went crawling
back to her husband.

02:10:58.289 --> 02:10:59.814
It's a world gone mad,
Casey.

02:10:59.890 --> 02:11:00.880
30's long.

02:11:00.958 --> 02:11:02.653
Dan fixed it.
Check your shot sheet.

02:11:02.727 --> 02:11:04.525
Dan fixed 30.
Show me Riverfront.

02:11:04.595 --> 02:11:05.858
<i>Stand by.</i>

02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:07.091
Three minutes to VTR,
four minutes live.

02:11:07.164 --> 02:11:08.529
-- Riverfronfs up.
-- That's not Riverfront.

02:11:08.599 --> 02:11:09.532
-- You're right.
-- That's Three Rivers.

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:10.533
I know.

02:11:10.601 --> 02:11:11.534
Riverfronfs in Cincinnati.

02:11:11.602 --> 02:11:12.626
I know where Riverfront is.

02:11:12.703 --> 02:11:14.398
-- Three Rivers is in Pittsburgh.
-- Yes.

02:11:14.472 --> 02:11:16.236
-- Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania.
-- Thanks very much.

02:11:16.307 --> 02:11:18.605
It works.
My new camera works.

02:11:18.676 --> 02:11:19.609
<i>Excellent.</i>

02:11:19.677 --> 02:11:21.645
The Soshi/Suntac RTS-lll,
baby.

02:11:21.712 --> 02:11:23.271
-- Riverfronfs up.
-- And it works.

02:11:23.347 --> 02:11:24.212
Thank you.
Show me Phoenix.

02:11:24.281 --> 02:11:26.648
Well, I don't know if it works,
but it looks incredibly good.

02:11:26.717 --> 02:11:28.412
-- What's the count back in?
-- <i>18</i> seconds.

02:11:28.486 --> 02:11:30.420
Judy, that's 18 seconds
for 30 cold.

02:11:30.488 --> 02:11:33.185
I'm going to take the inaugural picture
tomorrow -- the maiden photograph.

02:11:33.257 --> 02:11:34.747
I'd like everyone
to bring nice clothes.

02:11:34.825 --> 02:11:36.259
You're gonna take a picture
of our clothes?

02:11:36.327 --> 02:11:37.988
I think she meant she wanted us
to wear the clothes.

02:11:38.062 --> 02:11:39.257
That's exactly what I meant.
Spread the word.

02:11:39.330 --> 02:11:40.491
<i>Dave." Two minutes to VTR.</i>

02:11:40.564 --> 02:11:41.531
<i>Three minutes live.</i>

02:11:41.599 --> 02:11:42.532
It's an 18-second
count-back.

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:43.795
From the Red Sox?

02:11:43.868 --> 02:11:45.267
Yeah. And Dana wants to take
everyone's picture tomorrow.

02:11:45.336 --> 02:11:46.269
Why?

02:11:46.337 --> 02:11:47.395
She bought a new camera.

02:11:47.471 --> 02:11:48.495
I didn't know Dana
took pictures.

02:11:48.572 --> 02:11:50.233
She doesn't. She doesn't
know anything about cameras.

02:11:50.307 --> 02:11:51.502
But she felt the sudden
need to own one.

02:11:51.575 --> 02:11:53.509
-- Is this part of her
psychotic episode? -- Yes.

02:11:53.577 --> 02:11:55.204
-- Well, then, sign me up.
-- 18 back at 30.

02:11:55.279 --> 02:11:56.747
You guys are all set.
Have a good show.

02:11:56.814 --> 02:11:57.747
Thank you, Alyson.

02:11:57.815 --> 02:12:00.944
Alyson, did you know my son,
Charlie, went 3 for 3 yesterday,

02:12:01.018 --> 02:12:03.419
with 2 RBIs, 2 walks,
and a stolen base?

02:12:03.487 --> 02:12:05.080
-- No. That's great.
-- He did.

02:12:05.156 --> 02:12:07.215
I wasn't there to see it,
but that's a different thing,

02:12:07.291 --> 02:12:08.759
-- and I'm not gonna get
morose right now. -- Okay.

02:12:08.826 --> 02:12:09.987
-- I'm not gonna lay all that on you.
-- Okay.

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:11.494
-- I'm not gonna get heavy with you.
-- Okay.

02:12:11.562 --> 02:12:13.326
Even though I can see you're
feeling chatty right now.

02:12:13.397 --> 02:12:14.125
Yeah.

02:12:14.198 --> 02:12:15.256
-- Good show.
-- Jeremy...

02:12:15.332 --> 02:12:16.299
Seven pitches,
you believe that?

02:12:16.367 --> 02:12:17.334
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

02:12:17.401 --> 02:12:18.698
Three batters,
seven pitches.

02:12:18.769 --> 02:12:19.702
<i>Dana: What do you got?</i>

02:12:19.770 --> 02:12:21.704
Nothing. Bottom of the order
went down in seven pitches.

02:12:21.772 --> 02:12:22.705
<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

02:12:22.773 --> 02:12:24.400
Whatever happened to the
ninth-inning rally, huh?

02:12:24.475 --> 02:12:26.466
Yeah, and why don't we use
semicolons anymore?

02:12:26.544 --> 02:12:28.273
This show needs
a ninth-inning rally.

02:12:28.345 --> 02:12:30.404
I think, under the circumstances,
the show is doing fine.

02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:31.880
I think so, too.

02:12:31.949 --> 02:12:32.973
Then why did you say we need
a ninth-inning rally?

02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:34.381
I wasn't speaking
metaphorically.

02:12:34.451 --> 02:12:36.545
I meant the show could use
an actual ninth-inning rally.

02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.145
The show hasn't even
started yet.

02:12:38.222 --> 02:12:39.747
I'm not talking
about the show.

02:12:39.824 --> 02:12:42.020
I'm saying, “Wouldn't it be great
if the show we're about to do

02:12:42.092 --> 02:12:44.026
included
a ninth-inning rally?"

02:12:44.094 --> 02:12:46.620
And we're saying that in order
to have a ninth-inning rally,

02:12:46.697 --> 02:12:49.723
the show would have to necessarily
begin from a disadvantageous position,

02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:51.700
which neither one of us
thinks would be great.

02:12:51.769 --> 02:12:52.702
I'm gonna start again

02:12:52.770 --> 02:12:54.670
because that's how completely
you've both missed the point.

02:12:54.738 --> 02:12:57.298
<i>Dave: Roll VTR.

02:12:57.374 --> 02:12:58.500

02:12:58.576 --> 02:13:00.567
<i>Chris:
Loading 1, 2 and F/X-2.</i>

02:13:00.644 --> 02:13:02.738
Stepping out now.
We're live in 60.

02:13:02.813 --> 02:13:04.303
-- Elliott.
-- What do you need?

02:13:04.381 --> 02:13:05.678
Wouldn't you think
that Rebecca

02:13:05.749 --> 02:13:07.148
would've come crawling back
to me by now?

02:13:07.218 --> 02:13:09.118
If you love something,
you gotta set it free, Dan.

02:13:09.186 --> 02:13:11.314
-- That's good advice, dude, thanks.
-- 30 seconds.

02:13:11.388 --> 02:13:13.447
Do me a favor, would you?
When he comes by tomorrow,

02:13:13.524 --> 02:13:15.151
make a big deal out
of the baseball thing.

02:13:15.226 --> 02:13:16.159
I will.

02:13:16.227 --> 02:13:17.717
And try not to traumatize
the new nanny.

02:13:17.795 --> 02:13:19.661
Why would I traumatize
the new nanny?

02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:21.391
I don't know,
but you always do.

02:13:21.465 --> 02:13:22.762
-- I like nannies.
-- I know.

02:13:22.833 --> 02:13:23.994
I'm thinking about
getting one for myself.

02:13:24.068 --> 02:13:25.001
Good.

02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:27.299
'Course she'd probably end up
going back to her ex-husband.

02:13:27.371 --> 02:13:28.338
You'll make a big deal?

02:13:28.405 --> 02:13:30.271
I'll make a big deal.

02:13:30.341 --> 02:13:32.776
-- He's shaking hands, Danny.
-- Stop it.

02:13:32.843 --> 02:13:34.436
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

02:13:34.511 --> 02:13:36.172
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:13:36.247 --> 02:13:38.113
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

02:13:38.182 --> 02:13:39.877
Those stories,
plus we'll show you

02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:43.386
what a long, strange trip it's been
for the grateful Reds at Riverfront.

02:13:43.454 --> 02:13:45.388
And we'll show you how
Geraldo Garcia

02:13:45.456 --> 02:13:47.584
can just keep on truckin'
at Three Rivers.

02:13:47.658 --> 02:13:49.490
All that coming up
after this.

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:52.996
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

02:13:53.063 --> 02:13:53.996
<i>We're out.</i>

02:13:54.064 --> 02:13:55.361
<i>Kim: Two minutes back.</i>

02:13:59.336 --> 02:14:00.929
<i>Listen to me.
This isn't hard.</i>

02:14:01.005 --> 02:14:02.803
Forget we work
on a television show.

02:14:02.873 --> 02:14:05.399
We're just sports fans,
and we work in a haberdashery.

02:14:05.476 --> 02:14:07.808
A ninth-inning rally
would be a fun thing to see.

02:14:07.878 --> 02:14:09.437
-- Ah, I understand.
-- Yes.

02:14:09.513 --> 02:14:11.038
-- Thank you.
-- The haberdashery.

02:14:11.115 --> 02:14:12.048
Yes. That was all
I was saying.

02:14:12.116 --> 02:14:13.413
-- I was confused.
-- Yes, I know.

02:14:13.484 --> 02:14:15.316
But your haberdashery parable
cleared it up for me.

02:14:15.386 --> 02:14:16.353
Picture time!

02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:17.649
-- Speaking of confused.
-- Be nice.

02:14:17.721 --> 02:14:18.654
Kim, let's get everybody.

02:14:18.722 --> 02:14:19.655
<i>Kim: Dan!</i>

02:14:19.723 --> 02:14:20.781
Dana,
do you have the first idea

02:14:20.858 --> 02:14:22.519
how to operate
any of this equipment?

02:14:22.593 --> 02:14:24.891
This is called an
owner's manual, my friend,

02:14:24.962 --> 02:14:26.828
and I have read it
cover to cover.

02:14:26.897 --> 02:14:28.160
I've read Doctor Zhivago
cover to cover.

02:14:28.232 --> 02:14:29.461
It doesn't make me the czar.

02:14:29.533 --> 02:14:30.932
We have a name
for people like you

02:14:31.001 --> 02:14:32.162
back home in Cedar Rapids.

02:14:32.236 --> 02:14:33.761
It's called sourpuss.

02:14:33.837 --> 02:14:36.033
<i>We have a name for people like
you back home in Boston, too.</i>

02:14:36.106 --> 02:14:38.006
It's called --
Ow. Ow. Pain. Pain. Pain.

02:14:38.075 --> 02:14:39.372
Dan -- Good,
get over here.

02:14:39.443 --> 02:14:40.376
Dana, what the hell --

02:14:40.444 --> 02:14:41.468
Do you love it?

02:14:41.545 --> 02:14:42.637
How much did you spend
on this?

02:14:42.713 --> 02:14:43.805
It's a little extravagant,

02:14:43.881 --> 02:14:45.713
but I think a hubby's
a good idea for me.

02:14:45.783 --> 02:14:47.217
Annie Liebowitz
doesn't have --

02:14:47.284 --> 02:14:48.752
-- I'm treating myself.
-- Go to Vegas.

02:14:48.819 --> 02:14:49.877
I don't like Vegas.

02:14:49.954 --> 02:14:51.513
If you don't like Vegas,
then you're just crazy.

02:14:51.588 --> 02:14:52.749
That's what I'm saying.

02:14:52.823 --> 02:14:54.416
Dave, Chris, Will,
you guys are professionals.

02:14:54.491 --> 02:14:55.925
You couldn't talk her
out of this?

02:14:55.993 --> 02:14:57.085
We're just happy
to be in the picture.

02:14:57.161 --> 02:14:58.356
Great. Where's Casey?

02:14:58.429 --> 02:14:59.692
Madison Square Garden.

02:14:59.763 --> 02:15:00.992
What's he doing there?

02:15:01.065 --> 02:15:02.032
Interviewing Michelle Kwan.

02:15:02.099 --> 02:15:03.260
That was supposed to be you.

02:15:03.334 --> 02:15:04.267
Michelle Kwan
doesn't like me.

02:15:04.335 --> 02:15:05.325
You're wrong.

02:15:05.402 --> 02:15:06.665
She dissed me
at the Espys.

02:15:06.737 --> 02:15:07.898
-- She did not. Dan, she did not...
-- She dissed me.

02:15:07.972 --> 02:15:09.633
I gave her a little
of this at the Espys,

02:15:09.707 --> 02:15:11.232
and she frosted me,
not unlike Rebecca.

02:15:11.308 --> 02:15:12.707
We can't do the picture
without Casey.

02:15:12.776 --> 02:15:14.210
I gotta go someplace
and weep.

02:15:14.278 --> 02:15:15.905
Hang on, hang on.
You know what we're gonna do?

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.243
We're gonna do
a practice picture.

02:15:17.314 --> 02:15:18.839
-- <i>Dana...</i>
-- <i>Yes. Without Casey.</i>

02:15:18.916 --> 02:15:20.247
That way I can work out
any kinks,

02:15:20.317 --> 02:15:21.785
and he won't be
able to make any jokes.

02:15:21.852 --> 02:15:23.183
-- He wouldn't make anyjokes.
-- Yes, he would.

02:15:23.253 --> 02:15:24.880
-- Dana...
-- Gather up.

02:15:24.955 --> 02:15:26.320
We better do what she says.

02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:28.256
<i>All right. Now...
just so you know</i> --

02:15:28.325 --> 02:15:32.262
what we're workin' with here today
is the Soshi/Suntac RTS-lll

02:15:32.329 --> 02:15:33.524
with the built-in datapack
and a 70mm --

02:15:33.597 --> 02:15:36.123
-- Dana.
-- <i>Okay, everybody hold still.</i>

02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:37.861
Here's what's gonna happen.

02:15:37.935 --> 02:15:41.200
You're gonna hear three beeps
-- beep, beep, beep --

02:15:41.271 --> 02:15:43.968
followed by
a one-and-a-half-second pause,

02:15:44.041 --> 02:15:48.911
then a flash from my Exeter 220g strobe
with the 18-inch parabolic reflector.

02:15:48.979 --> 02:15:50.208
Ready?

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:51.907
Could you tell us again what the
beeps are gonna sound like?

02:15:51.982 --> 02:15:53.347
Hold still.

02:15:53.417 --> 02:15:55.215
[Beeps]

02:15:55.285 --> 02:15:57.481
[Sighs]

02:15:57.554 --> 02:16:00.649
[ Beep, beep, beep]

02:16:02.292 --> 02:16:04.056
[Telephone ringing
in distance]

02:16:04.128 --> 02:16:07.120
Don't be impatient now,

02:16:07.197 --> 02:16:10.565
'cause a second and a half
is a lot longer than you think.

02:16:10.634 --> 02:16:13.296
[Ringing continues]

02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:14.735
[Camera shutter clicks]

02:16:14.805 --> 02:16:16.796
Well, it's a little timing
problem.

02:16:16.874 --> 02:16:17.807
I can fix that.

02:16:17.875 --> 02:16:19.274
Also, the flash
didn't go off.

02:16:19.343 --> 02:16:20.276
That's right.

02:16:20.344 --> 02:16:22.278
[Gasps]

02:16:22.346 --> 02:16:25.407
VVell, I don't see where Casey could
have gotten any material here, Dana.

02:16:25.482 --> 02:16:27.473
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

02:16:27.551 --> 02:16:28.848
I'm gonna iron out
these wrinkles,

02:16:28.919 --> 02:16:30.284
and we're gonna do this
again later.

02:16:30.354 --> 02:16:31.480
We'll gather.

02:16:31.555 --> 02:16:32.886
Dana, Gordon's on your line.

02:16:32.956 --> 02:16:34.617
Okay.

02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:35.715
Hello?

02:16:35.793 --> 02:16:37.591
There are 28 teams
playing tonight.

02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:39.959
What we want is for one of them to be getting
absolutely humiliated in the late innings.

02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:41.054
Why?

02:16:41.130 --> 02:16:42.155
-- 'Cause we're sports fans.
-- In a haberdashery.

02:16:42.232 --> 02:16:43.165
<i>Yes.</i>

02:16:43.233 --> 02:16:44.894
Wow, this is quite
a place, huh?

02:16:44.968 --> 02:16:47.232
Holly, do you know
what time it is?

02:16:47.304 --> 02:16:49.432
It's half past 4:00.
We're fine.

02:16:49.505 --> 02:16:51.406
'Cause it's just my mother
will be mad if I'm late.

02:16:51.475 --> 02:16:52.772
We're fine.

02:16:52.843 --> 02:16:55.174
Hey, Charlie, I heard a rumor
you were paying a visit.

02:16:55.245 --> 02:16:56.178
Hi.

02:16:56.245 --> 02:16:57.611
Dana Whitaker.

02:16:57.681 --> 02:16:59.206
Hi, I'm Holly.
I'm the new nanny.

02:16:59.282 --> 02:17:01.148
-- Deborah had to --
-- I heard.

02:17:01.218 --> 02:17:03.516
Hey, listen, Charlie, your dad
should be here any minute.

02:17:03.587 --> 02:17:05.316
He had to go crosstown
to interview an ice skater.

02:17:05.388 --> 02:17:06.719
Do you mind if we wait?

02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:08.884
No, of course not.
No. I'll just --

02:17:08.959 --> 02:17:11.620
I have to be here
because I got a phone call.

02:17:11.695 --> 02:17:14.425
Someone's meeting me here,
but I'll meet you --

02:17:14.498 --> 02:17:16.660
I'll put you
in the conference room.

02:17:16.733 --> 02:17:17.962
We shouldn't be late.

02:17:18.035 --> 02:17:18.933
We're okay.

02:17:19.002 --> 02:17:21.664
Jeremy, come here.
Meet Charlie McCall.

02:17:21.737 --> 02:17:24.173
Hey, nice to meet you.
I'm Jeremy.

02:17:24.241 --> 02:17:25.639
Hi.

02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:27.870
Jeremy, could you take Holly and
Charlie to the conference room?

02:17:27.945 --> 02:17:28.968
-- Sure.
-- I've gotta wait here.

02:17:29.046 --> 02:17:30.207
-- Um, Holly?
-- Yeah?

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:31.611
-- I think my mom --
-- We're meeting her soon.

02:17:31.682 --> 02:17:32.978
Jeremy...

02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:35.212
I've gotta wait here.
I'll be right here.

02:17:35.285 --> 02:17:36.377
Okay.

02:17:56.573 --> 02:17:57.505
Gordon!

02:17:57.574 --> 02:17:59.041
-- Dana?
-- I'm over here.

02:17:59.109 --> 02:18:00.474
I'm sorry it took so long.

02:18:00.544 --> 02:18:02.808
Something's
happening on Sixth Avenue.

02:18:02.879 --> 02:18:04.507
<i>I know.
Casey isn't back yet either.</i>

02:18:04.615 --> 02:18:05.912
Yeah.

02:18:05.983 --> 02:18:07.712
I was worried on the phone.
It sounded important.

02:18:07.784 --> 02:18:09.775
-- Yeah. I-l wanted to come over
-- -- You want to sit down?

02:18:09.852 --> 02:18:11.446
I wanted to come over, 'cause I know we're
supposed to go to that thing tonight.

02:18:11.522 --> 02:18:13.012
-- We're not going?
-- Listen...

02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:14.580
I'm not saying we need to go,
I just thought it would be fun,

02:18:14.657 --> 02:18:15.921
'cause we don't get to get
dressed up that much --

02:18:15.993 --> 02:18:17.757
I need you to stop talking.

02:18:18.995 --> 02:18:20.827
Okay.

02:18:20.897 --> 02:18:23.093
I wanted to come over --

02:18:23.166 --> 02:18:25.431
[Sighs]

02:18:25.502 --> 02:18:27.094
What is it?

02:18:28.237 --> 02:18:29.933
Unless you're calling off
the engagement,

02:18:30.007 --> 02:18:32.305
I can't even imagine what it is
that has you so frazzled.

02:18:40.384 --> 02:18:43.148
Why would you call off
the engagement?

02:18:44.388 --> 02:18:45.787
Because --

02:18:45.856 --> 02:18:47.915
I'd prefer not to talk here.

02:18:47.991 --> 02:18:49.924
-- Should we go someplace?
-- Yeah.

02:18:58.135 --> 02:19:01.161
[Telephone ringing]

02:19:01.237 --> 02:19:02.535
Dana, how would you feel

02:19:02.606 --> 02:19:05.268
about moving the pre-fight
coverage to the 4-block?

02:19:05.342 --> 02:19:08.573
Kevin would need
to give us 15 back.

02:19:14.351 --> 02:19:16.285
<i>Man:
We're two minutes long.</i>

02:19:16.352 --> 02:19:17.377
We'll get it.

02:19:30.867 --> 02:19:31.857
So...

02:19:31.934 --> 02:19:32.868
Yeah.

02:19:32.936 --> 02:19:33.869
What were we talking about?

02:19:33.937 --> 02:19:35.495
-- Dana...
-- That was a joke.

02:19:35.572 --> 02:19:36.903
-- Look...
-- It was a joke.

02:19:36.974 --> 02:19:38.100
I know.

02:19:38.174 --> 02:19:39.267
I'm just saying
I think I'm funnier

02:19:39.343 --> 02:19:40.777
than you've given me credit
for being in the past.

02:19:40.843 --> 02:19:42.369
Here's what I've been thinking
the past few days --

02:19:42.446 --> 02:19:43.709
I'm just saying, if you're
calling off the engagement

02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:44.804
because you don't
think I'm funny enough --

02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:45.848
Would you stop?

02:19:45.915 --> 02:19:47.475
You're angry right now?
You're mad at me?

02:19:47.550 --> 02:19:48.950
Dana, I am not gonna --

02:19:49.019 --> 02:19:50.748
You spend six months making me
feel guilty for liking my job,

02:19:50.821 --> 02:19:52.789
then propose to me,
then two days later,

02:19:52.856 --> 02:19:55.882
you tell me you've slept with
the woman who wants my job.

02:19:55.959 --> 02:19:57.518
<i>I say, "Fine."</i>
I <i>say, "Fine."</i>

02:19:57.594 --> 02:20:00.359
Then six days after that, you tell me
you want to break off the engagement?

02:20:00.430 --> 02:20:02.990
Here's the thing -- I think only one
of us should be angry at a time,

02:20:03.066 --> 02:20:05.535
and I have a hunch
it's gonna be me.

02:20:05.602 --> 02:20:06.865
I think you're hung up
on Casey.

02:20:06.937 --> 02:20:08.905
-- That's what this is about?
-- That's what this is about.

02:20:08.972 --> 02:20:10.406
-- I am not. -- You are.
You don't cover it well.

02:20:10.474 --> 02:20:12.772
This is a cheap excuse
to get out of marrying me,

02:20:12.843 --> 02:20:15.073
which you never wanted to
do in the third place.

02:20:15.145 --> 02:20:16.340
And the only reason

02:20:16.413 --> 02:20:18.643
you proposed in the second place
was out of guilt

02:20:18.715 --> 02:20:21.082
for having slept with Sally
in the first place.

02:20:21.151 --> 02:20:23.176
You say, "Fine"?

02:20:24.121 --> 02:20:26.112
I sleep with Sally and
you say, "Fine"?

02:20:26.189 --> 02:20:28.851
Casey sleeps with Sally, you have
a level-3 nervous breakdown.

02:20:28.925 --> 02:20:30.415
You're calling off
the engagement

02:20:30.494 --> 02:20:31.620
because I wasn't mad enough

02:20:31.695 --> 02:20:33.527
when I found out
you were sleeping around?

02:20:33.597 --> 02:20:34.826
Let's do the whole thing
all over again,

02:20:34.898 --> 02:20:36.388
and this time, I'll just beat
the living crap out of you.

02:20:36.466 --> 02:20:37.661
-- I'm leaving.
-- Don't go.

02:20:37.734 --> 02:20:38.667
Dana --

02:20:38.735 --> 02:20:40.260
Don't go.

02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:45.975
Oh, what the hell. Go.

02:20:50.547 --> 02:20:53.107
Maybe we can talk more
about this later.

02:20:53.183 --> 02:20:54.378
[Laughs]

02:20:54.451 --> 02:20:58.445
Yeah, let's talk about this
as much as humanly possible.

02:20:58.522 --> 02:20:59.785
This is yours.

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:04.293
-- Thanks.
-- Gordon?

02:21:04.361 --> 02:21:05.351
Yeah.

02:21:07.998 --> 02:21:11.434
I was a lot funnier than you
ever gave me credit for being.

02:21:35.559 --> 02:21:36.924
How's it going over there?

02:21:36.993 --> 02:21:38.188
I've got nine of them.

02:21:38.261 --> 02:21:39.387
How many are there?

02:21:39.463 --> 02:21:40.396
20.

02:21:40.464 --> 02:21:41.954
You're almost halfway done.

02:21:42.065 --> 02:21:44.295
Maybe it's okay if I leave
a note for my father.

02:21:44.334 --> 02:21:45.961
You don't have to
leave a note.

02:21:46.036 --> 02:21:47.936
We're gonna see him
in a minute.

02:21:48.004 --> 02:21:49.938
-- <i>Charlie...</i>
-- <i>Hey,</i> Dan.

02:21:50.006 --> 02:21:51.770
What is up with you
not coming by to say hi?

02:21:51.842 --> 02:21:52.832
I was in here.

02:21:52.909 --> 02:21:54.468
I can see that you're in here.
Can you see that over there?

02:21:54.544 --> 02:21:55.636
That's my office.

02:21:55.712 --> 02:21:57.180
I make it a six-and-a-half-
second walk from here.

02:21:57.247 --> 02:21:58.180
What do you think?

02:21:58.248 --> 02:21:59.306
Sorry.

02:21:59.383 --> 02:22:01.511
Yeah, sorry don't make the buttercup shine.
Who's your friend?

02:22:01.585 --> 02:22:03.713
Hi, I'm Holly.
I'm the new nanny. Deborah --

02:22:03.787 --> 02:22:05.152
I lived through the trauma.

02:22:05.222 --> 02:22:06.519
Yeah.

02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:07.716
Listen, I need to speak
to Charles for a sec

02:22:07.791 --> 02:22:08.724
if you feel like
taking five.

02:22:08.792 --> 02:22:10.385
Sure.

02:22:13.029 --> 02:22:16.624
3 for 3 with 2 RBIs,
2 walks, and a stolen base.

02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:17.633
Yeah.

02:22:17.701 --> 02:22:18.964
What's a stolen base?

02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:27.734
I'm gonna pop
this tape in here.

02:22:27.811 --> 02:22:32.271
It's the show your father and
I did the night before last.

02:22:32.349 --> 02:22:35.751
Ken Griffey Jr., busting out
of his slump at the Kingdome

02:22:35.819 --> 02:22:39.050
by going 3 for 3 with 2 RBIs,
2 walks, and a stolen base,

02:22:39.122 --> 02:22:42.057
<i>raising his season batting av--</i>

02:22:45.362 --> 02:22:46.352
What's going on?

02:22:46.430 --> 02:22:47.864
What do you mean?

02:22:47.931 --> 02:22:49.524
I know there's nothing wrong
with padding your stats

02:22:49.599 --> 02:22:51.192
over pizza after the game,

02:22:51.268 --> 02:22:55.637
but I'm a little concerned you
feel you need to lie to your dad.

02:22:55.705 --> 02:22:57.264
I can't play very well.

02:22:57.340 --> 02:22:59.206
Most people
can't play very well.

02:22:59.276 --> 02:23:01.506
I can't play at all.

02:23:01.578 --> 02:23:03.012
Charlie, listen --
[Knock on door]

02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:06.181
Hey, hey, big man,
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:23:06.249 --> 02:23:07.910
Hi, Dad.

02:23:11.288 --> 02:23:13.188
Charlie, are you selling me
an insurance policy?

02:23:15.258 --> 02:23:17.488
<i>Casey, can I speak to you
for a second about Cleveland?</i>

02:23:17.561 --> 02:23:18.687
Well, I just got here.

02:23:18.762 --> 02:23:19.957
Just one second,
then he's all yours.

02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:21.361
[Sighs]
I'll be right back.

02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:31.432
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

02:23:31.508 --> 02:23:33.033
-- How'd the interview go?
-- Fine.

02:23:33.109 --> 02:23:34.736
Good. Say, listen,
I think I know why

02:23:34.811 --> 02:23:36.370
Charlie's behaving
a little strange.

02:23:36.446 --> 02:23:38.073
-- Really? -- Yeah, it's
'cause you're a jackass.

02:23:38.148 --> 02:23:39.445
What are you --

02:23:39.516 --> 02:23:40.642
Casey, he can't play.

02:23:40.717 --> 02:23:43.379
You've seen him play.
You know he can't play.

02:23:43.487 --> 02:23:44.784
What made you think
all of a sudden --

02:23:44.821 --> 02:23:45.788
Wait. He lied to me?

02:23:45.856 --> 02:23:47.153
Yeah, and you know what else?

02:23:47.224 --> 02:23:49.318
It's actually the first time
in history

02:23:49.392 --> 02:23:50.757
that a son has lied
to his father,

02:23:50.827 --> 02:23:51.851
so I would definitely
go off the deep end.

02:23:51.928 --> 02:23:53.293
Charlie!

02:23:53.363 --> 02:23:55.593
-- Casey.
-- What?

02:23:55.665 --> 02:23:56.996
He's such a good little guy.

02:23:59.669 --> 02:24:02.001
Dad, I shouldn't be late
for meeting Mom at the --

02:24:02.072 --> 02:24:04.973
Your mom can deal with it, and
if she can't, she can learn how.

02:24:05.041 --> 02:24:06.133
Come with me, please.

02:24:06.209 --> 02:24:08.337
[Telephones ringing]

02:24:13.383 --> 02:24:15.750

02:24:19.055 --> 02:24:21.251
[Sighs]

02:24:21.324 --> 02:24:23.656
You know I don't like lying.

02:24:23.727 --> 02:24:25.422
There's no need
for it, Charlie.

02:24:25.495 --> 02:24:26.826
Did you really think
I was gonna be mad at you

02:24:26.897 --> 02:24:28.262
because you didn't play well
in a baseball game?

02:24:28.331 --> 02:24:29.799
I'm sorry.

02:24:29.866 --> 02:24:32.358
I got to find this out
from Dan?

02:24:32.435 --> 02:24:34.870
I also think you're old enough to
have something more than “I'm sorry.“

02:24:34.938 --> 02:24:37.305
But I can't play.

02:24:39.709 --> 02:24:42.940
And I lied 'cause I didn't
want to embarrass you.

02:24:45.181 --> 02:24:47.309
I'm sorry.

02:24:53.390 --> 02:24:54.448
Come here.

02:24:58.528 --> 02:25:02.158
That was really hard for you
to say, wasn't it?

02:25:02.232 --> 02:25:03.893
You were scared during that?

02:25:03.967 --> 02:25:05.298
Yeah.

02:25:05.368 --> 02:25:08.065
Well, it didn't show.
You were really calm and honest.

02:25:08.138 --> 02:25:11.301
But I knew you were scared
anyway, 'cause I'm your father.

02:25:14.945 --> 02:25:18.347
You were worried
you might embarrass me.

02:25:18.415 --> 02:25:19.473
Man.

02:25:20.951 --> 02:25:23.420
There should be no doubt in
anyone's mind that you're my son.

02:25:23.486 --> 02:25:25.545
And you can't even blame me,

02:25:25.622 --> 02:25:27.056
'cause Grandpa started it.

02:25:27.123 --> 02:25:29.956
And I have a hunch his dad
was no picnic, either.

02:25:32.395 --> 02:25:36.059
So, Charlie, I am nipping this
in the bud right now.

02:25:36.132 --> 02:25:38.100
Pay close attention --

02:25:38.168 --> 02:25:42.264
in your lifetime,
you will never embarrass me.

02:25:42.339 --> 02:25:44.171
It's not gonna happen.

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:46.868
You play baseball if you
want to play baseball.

02:25:46.943 --> 02:25:49.674
And the only thing you have to
do to make me and your mom happy

02:25:49.746 --> 02:25:51.771
is come home
at the end of the day.

02:25:54.050 --> 02:25:55.984
In your lifetime,
you'll never embarrass me.

02:25:56.052 --> 02:25:57.042
You know why?

02:25:58.622 --> 02:26:02.718
'Cause I'm your father.
Who'd you think I was?

02:26:02.792 --> 02:26:04.624
[Knock on door]

02:26:05.528 --> 02:26:07.360
Casey, we gotta meet Lisa.

02:26:07.430 --> 02:26:10.229
[Sighs]
Then be gone with you both.

02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:10.926
Bye, Dad.

02:26:14.137 --> 02:26:15.263
Bye.

02:26:15.338 --> 02:26:17.102
Bye.

02:26:18.642 --> 02:26:20.076
Bye.

02:26:23.546 --> 02:26:25.605
[Sighs deeply]

02:26:33.823 --> 02:26:35.291
-- We're in business.
-- What business?

02:26:35.358 --> 02:26:36.587
We're in the comeback
business.

02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:38.128
You told me we sold men's
accessories.

02:26:38.194 --> 02:26:39.628
Try and be with me on this,
would you?

02:26:39.696 --> 02:26:43.997
Listen to me.
Everybody, stop your work.

02:26:44.067 --> 02:26:45.592
A writer once wrote,

02:26:45.669 --> 02:26:48.104
"As if it matters
how a man falls down.

02:26:48.171 --> 02:26:51.471
When the fall is all that's
left, it matters very much."

02:26:51.541 --> 02:26:52.940
What did he mean by that?

02:26:53.009 --> 02:26:55.410
He meant do not abandon
blow-outs.

02:26:55.478 --> 02:26:57.469
Watching proud
and accomplished athletes

02:26:57.547 --> 02:27:00.107
battle in the face of odds
that are virtually hopeless

02:27:00.183 --> 02:27:02.675
is one of the more stirring
sights in all of sports.

02:27:02.752 --> 02:27:05.483
The Phillies have been down
14 to 1 since the third inning,

02:27:05.555 --> 02:27:07.751
and I think it's the best
game we've got.

02:27:07.824 --> 02:27:10.020
That is all.

02:27:10.093 --> 02:27:11.720
-- Picture time. Let's go.
-- Excellent.

02:27:11.795 --> 02:27:14.423
Natalie, gather everybody up
and tell 'em it's picture time.

02:27:14.497 --> 02:27:17.125
Hey, maybe you could start by just drawing
a picture, that way -- Ow, ow, ow.

02:27:23.006 --> 02:27:25.634
-- Hey. Picture time.
-- Hey.

02:27:25.709 --> 02:27:26.938
What happened to your ring?

02:27:27.010 --> 02:27:28.102
-- What do you mean?
-- What happened to your ring?

02:27:28.178 --> 02:27:29.270
-- My engagement ring?
-- Yeah.

02:27:29.345 --> 02:27:31.507
It's being cleaned.
It's at the ring cleaners.

02:27:31.581 --> 02:27:33.777
I didn't know they had
special places for that.

02:27:33.850 --> 02:27:34.783
Yeah.

02:27:34.851 --> 02:27:36.148
Hey. Charlie looked good.

02:27:36.219 --> 02:27:37.152
-- Didn't he?
-- Yeah.

02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:38.949
VVait. I don't understand. You
leave the ring there overnight?

02:27:39.022 --> 02:27:40.046
Yeah.

02:27:40.123 --> 02:27:42.558
VVell, how does a ring cleaner carry the
kind of insurance premiums to cover --

02:27:42.659 --> 02:27:43.990
Don't worry about it.

02:27:44.027 --> 02:27:46.394
It's picture time.
It's picture time.

02:27:46.463 --> 02:27:47.794
I've fixed the glitch.
We're good to go.

02:27:47.864 --> 02:27:49.298
We're ready to roll.
Let's make some magic.

02:27:49.365 --> 02:27:50.662
I've forgotten --
do the three beeps

02:27:50.734 --> 02:27:52.202
come before or after
the strobe blows up?

02:27:52.268 --> 02:27:53.702
Hold still.

02:27:53.770 --> 02:27:54.896
Hold these positions.

02:27:54.971 --> 02:27:56.496
Here we go.

02:27:56.573 --> 02:27:57.506
<i>Whoa'.!</i>

02:27:57.574 --> 02:27:59.167

Everybody just stay where
you are. This is nothing.

02:28:14.591 --> 02:28:16.355
This is
a small timing problem.

Casey, if you even say
one word --

02:28:21.865 --> 02:28:23.890
At least the strobe
didn't explode.

02:28:23.967 --> 02:28:25.560
[Explosion]
Aaahhh!

02:28:25.635 --> 02:28:27.569
All right, that's it.

02:28:27.637 --> 02:28:28.866
That is absolutely it!

Hey, where's your ring?

02:28:29.973 --> 02:28:31.372
It's at the cleaners.

<i>It's not at the cleaners,
you idiot!</i>

But this
is really the living end.

that I have seen enough,

to happen!

off the floor faster than you.

of a crumbcake there,

So, what's the problem?

02:30:17.313 --> 02:30:19.213
Well, Casey,
it's pretty complicated.

02:30:19.282 --> 02:30:21.046
This is a sophisticated
instrument.

02:30:21.117 --> 02:30:22.516
It's not any one thing,

02:30:22.585 --> 02:30:24.576
and it would be difficult
to explain to someone

who didn't have at least an
intermediate background in photography.

02:30:27.991 --> 02:30:31.484

put the film in backwards.

-- What?

02:30:33.596 --> 02:30:35.291
