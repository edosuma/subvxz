Well, you didn't have to say that.

03:23.747 --> 03:26.625

to cancel the SAT tutor, I guess?

03:26.750 --> 03:27.793
I didn't think you were wrong.

03:27.918 --> 03:30.629
Because who cares
if Abigail doesn't get her scores up

You wanted to propose that?

Why don't you just say this is Bonnie's idea?

04:00.158 --> 04:02.369
Yeah, okay, yeah. It's Bonnie's idea.

04:04.204 --> 04:06.665
Personally, I think the idea of us
all getting along is ridiculous.

04:06.915 --> 04:09.709
But, you know, that's one of the things
that really defines being a husband

04:09.835 --> 04:11.962
is your willingness to go along
with your wife's fucked-up ideas.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.088
- Give me a break.
- Like, by way of example,

04:13.171 --> 04:14.297
when I was with you, you remember?

04:14.381 --> 04:16.591
I paid $9,000 to ground the house

so that we all didn't get brain cancer.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.096
Or the time when we went camping?

04:21.178 --> 04:24.224

bite the shit out of me." Doesn't matter.

04:25.851 --> 04:27.227
What is your point, Nathan?

04:27.352 --> 04:30.021
My point is,
I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage,

04:30.105 --> 04:31.356
a lot of hoops I jumped through for you,

04:31.440 --> 04:33.400

for Bonnie.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.277

an electric eel up my ass

04:35.360 --> 04:36.820
and have it gnaw through my intestines

04:36.903 --> 04:40.574
than sit down with you and fucking

- Dickhead.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.034
- Asshole.
- Abominable pig.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.953
I'd kill him if I could.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.874
Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that loudly
in public spaces.

16:37.957 --> 16:39.750
I'm just kidding. (LAUGHS)

16:40.376 --> 16:41.586
Oh, my God.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.714
You really thought any more
aboutcounsehng?

16:44.797 --> 16:45.882
No.

16:47.925 --> 16:51.512
But I have been thinking about something,
though. Don't get mad at me.

16:51.596 --> 16:53.264
I just...

16:53.389 --> 16:56.017
I don't know. It's really hard.
I think maybe we need to move back.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.812
- No!
- Well, Ziggy's just not happy here. I can tell.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.105
- No, honey.
- CELESTE: Hey.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.065
How we doing?

17:03.149 --> 17:06.234
- Is this your go-to-meeting outfit?
- Yes. This is it.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.486
Wow!

17:08.112 --> 17:10.615
- Is there a cape under there?
- Would you stop it?

17:11.281 --> 17:13.075
- You just have to wait and see, won't you?
- MADELINE: Mmm.

17:13.159 --> 17:14.202
We are gonna win.

17:14.285 --> 17:19.207
So, uh, in breaking news, madam just told me
that she's thinking about moving.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.375
- I'm just thinking about it.
- What? No.

17:21.459 --> 17:23.127
- No freaking way.
- Oh.

17:23.836 --> 17:27.548
Come on, don't give in. Ziggy didn't do it.
Do not let them get to you.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.467
I'm not giving in. I just...

17:30.092 --> 17:33.387
I don't know, I need to do what's best
for my kid. I don't know what that is, but...

17:33.471 --> 17:35.139
What about what's best for us?

17:36.265 --> 17:38.809
-(CHUCKLES) We would miss you.
- We would miss you.

17:39.477 --> 17:41.896
- You're gonna make me cry.
- And we're gonna win this case.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.064
I'm telling you.

17:43.147 --> 17:46.025
I think the mayor's gonna like your argument.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.318
CELESTE: Would you stop it?

17:48.319 --> 17:51.405
We've had who knows how many orientations.
Nobody ever got choked.

17:51.489 --> 17:54.575
- Who are the new variables here?
- Jane Chapman and her son Ziggy.

17:54.659 --> 17:57.119
Whose eyes are abnormally far apart.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.329
A sign of a sociopath.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.414
BONNIE: Are we gonna make
some changes today?

18:00.498 --> 18:01.582
(CLASS CHEERING)

18:01.666 --> 18:04.001
That's right.
We're gonna start with uppercuts.

18:04.961 --> 18:06.837
- And one.
-(CHANGES PLAYING OVER STEREO)

18:07.463 --> 18:08.506
Extend those arms.

18:08.631 --> 18:11.342
Two, one. First position.

18:14.845 --> 18:18.557
One and serve the platter. In, out.

18:20.685 --> 18:22.520
Out. And lift.

18:26.232 --> 18:29.986
- And Whip! Whip! Whip!
-(CLASS CHEERING)

18:31.028 --> 18:32.321
Other side.

18:40.871 --> 18:41.872
Hey.

18:41.998 --> 18:46.043
God, I just love sweat on women.

18:47.545 --> 18:50.840
Sorry, that was more of a general observation.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.968
I'm going to assume that you're not here
to talk about physical fitness.

18:54.051 --> 18:57.888
Yeah. Madeline told me about the dinner
you and Nathan are proposing,

18:58.014 --> 19:00.891
which I think is potentially a good idea.

19:01.517 --> 19:02.727
But...

19:03.185 --> 19:05.229
Well, Nathan and Madeline.

19:06.188 --> 19:09.400
That's a pretty volatile cocktail.

19:10.735 --> 19:13.237
- What about you, Ed?
- What, what?

19:13.571 --> 19:15.740
You've been a little aggressive as of late.

19:16.907 --> 19:20.578
Yeah, well, I'm only trying to be
supportive of Madeline.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.414
She was kind of abandoned by her dad,
you know?

19:23.539 --> 19:24.832
He made time for her brothers.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.501
And she felt abandoned by Nathan,
and now Abigail.

19:27.585 --> 19:31.088
It's like a triple whammy.
She's in a pretty fragile state.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.592
You know, we all have baggage, Ed.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.427
What do you mean?

19:38.471 --> 19:39.930
Nothing.

19:44.101 --> 19:47.438
It doesn't help, by the way, that you're
this seemingly-perfect stepmom.

19:48.481 --> 19:50.399
Anyway, we're going to do this dinner,

19:50.483 --> 19:54.528
but I think it'll be up to you and me
to keep things civil.

19:54.612 --> 19:55.946
- Ihearyou.
- All right.

19:58.115 --> 20:03.245
Oh, also, it's probably best if you don't give
Madeline any kind of advice,

20:03.662 --> 20:05.956
like how to peel a potato.

20:08.751 --> 20:09.794
Okay.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.261
ALL: (SINGING) Otter Bay

20:19.970 --> 20:23.641
<i>Together we stand strong
Otter Bay</i>

20:23.766 --> 20:27.144
<i>Come on and sing along beautiful</i>

20:27.603 --> 20:32.441
<i>We learn arithmetic
Science and mathematics</i>

20:32.817 --> 20:34.860
<i>Otter in the bay</i>

20:35.152 --> 20:36.445
Amabella.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.961
You weren't singing. ls there a reason?

20:52.670 --> 20:54.547
No. I just didn't feel like it.

20:54.839 --> 20:57.341
Oh, but you typically love the singalongs.

20:59.844 --> 21:02.012
Seems like something's
a little wrong, sweetie.

21:03.681 --> 21:05.516
Are you sure
you're not upset about something?

21:06.517 --> 21:07.852
You can tell me.

21:07.977 --> 21:09.311
I promise I will keep it a secret.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.192
How are things with you and Ziggy?

21:15.860 --> 21:18.737
Fine. He's nice. We're friends.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.364
That's great.

21:20.906 --> 21:23.159
What do you and Ziggy like to do together?

21:24.410 --> 21:26.203
We just like playing and stuff.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.914
And he's nice to you?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.208
Yes.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.253
Amabella.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.673
Is somebody still hurting you?

21:40.718 --> 21:42.219
MADELINE: / <i>found Ziggy's father.</i>

21:43.220 --> 21:45.556
- You found him?
- Well, I think I found him.

21:45.681 --> 21:49.477
But it's Saxon Baker.
He's an interior designer in San Luis Obispo.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.437
Hold on, didn't she say
his name was Saxon Banks?

21:51.562 --> 21:52.980
- Well, I think maybe he only gave...
- JOSEPH: Maddie.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.983
...his real first name.
She said he was an architect.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.319
But sometimes
interior designers say they're architects.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.988
- Oh, this is not good.
- Thanks so much for helping us out.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.949
- But I'm having second thoughts about this.
- MADELINE: What?

22:04.074 --> 22:07.369
Look, even should we win this battle,
we make an enemy of the mayor's office.

22:07.453 --> 22:09.747
- But we have all of our funding.
- Long-term, it's not a good idea.

22:09.872 --> 22:11.040
And we're starting in two weeks, Joseph.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.334
Yeah, but what about the next production?
And the one after that?

22:13.417 --> 22:15.920
Listen to me, do you think Avenue <i>Q</i>
is worth fighting for?

22:16.629 --> 22:18.589
- Yeah.
- Well, then what are we talking about?

22:18.714 --> 22:20.591
The future of the theater itself.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.344
If we piss off the mayor,
and I've been told he pisses off easily...

22:23.427 --> 22:24.762
I can keep it civil.

22:28.224 --> 22:29.433
IVIADELINEI Oh, no.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.602
Or maybe not.

22:33.812 --> 22:38.442
Look, I'm not looking to, like,
"chill" artistic expression.

22:38.609 --> 22:39.985
I hear it's a great play.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.780
That said, the puppets fuck.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.074
We can't have puppets fucking in Monterey.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.283
May I be heard?

22:46.408 --> 22:52.122
There is one scene, and one scene only,
where two of the puppets simulate sex.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.291
- There's no nudity.
- Yeah?

22:55.251 --> 22:56.669
Naked puppets don't bother me.

22:57.336 --> 23:00.422
Fucking puppets, on the other hand...
It's vulgar.

23:00.839 --> 23:05.135
Even if it were, you'd still have to prove
that it has no legal, artistic or literary value.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.429
I'm not talking about legals.

23:07.513 --> 23:10.015
- We're going to have to talk about the...
-(CELESTE CLEARS THROAT)

23:10.849 --> 23:15.104
To shut down a show simply because
it makes you uncomfortable

23:15.187 --> 23:17.565
two weeks before it's about to open,
I don't think that that's...

23:17.648 --> 23:19.191
Okay, look, look.

23:19.608 --> 23:22.194
I'm new to the whole controversy, okay?

23:22.820 --> 23:25.990
It's just been brought to my attention,
mostly by concerned parents.

23:26.115 --> 23:29.994
So I'm bringing a fresh eye to this thing,
you know?

23:30.327 --> 23:33.330
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It wouldn't be the first.

23:33.497 --> 23:34.582
(LAUGHS)

23:34.665 --> 23:37.459
But from my perspective,
the whole point of the theater

23:37.543 --> 23:39.336
is to bring community together.

23:40.004 --> 23:41.213
- You know, to entertain...
- Mmm-hmm.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.049
...to have an affirming effect on society.

23:46.218 --> 23:49.305
This thing here? It's already divisive.

23:49.638 --> 23:50.764
RENATAI True.

23:50.848 --> 23:53.851
And I'm certainly
not trying to connect the two, but, uh,

23:54.184 --> 23:57.521
there are zoning laws that prohibit sex shops
and strip clubs...

23:57.688 --> 24:00.316
- Come on. This is hardly that.
- Yes, but...

24:00.399 --> 24:04.361
MADELINE: This play deals with love,
and racism, and same-sex marriage,

24:04.486 --> 24:05.863
which are all redeeming themes,

24:06.488 --> 24:08.991
conversations this community
should be having.

24:09.241 --> 24:12.703
- I mean, and if you want to continue to have...
- Puppets fuck.

24:12.870 --> 24:13.871
(RENATA LAUGHS)

24:14.204 --> 24:15.539
RENATA: You are adorable.

24:16.582 --> 24:19.710
May I, uh, speak for a moment?

24:19.835 --> 24:23.839
Not as a member of the Monterey
Planning Board, but, really, as a mom?

24:24.590 --> 24:27.551
I think we can agree that the world
has gone to hell, right?

24:27.843 --> 24:30.179
I mean, we're living in a time
where our little ones

24:30.262 --> 24:33.265
have lockdown drills at school
because of gun violence.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.518
They don't even feel safe
in their own classroom.

24:37.186 --> 24:41.899
So what if we brought back
a little good, old-fashioned nostalgia?

24:42.191 --> 24:44.068
<i>You know,</i> a <i>little Sound of Music?</i>

24:44.193 --> 24:46.195
I mean, we're Monterey, right?

24:46.278 --> 24:48.530
So, what do we want to say?

24:48.614 --> 24:53.744
And maybe the question isn't,
"What is this play?" but, "Who are we?"

24:54.244 --> 24:57.081
- Hmm.
- CELESTE: I take your point. It's a good one.

24:57.748 --> 25:03.462
We all have small children and this is
the village that we've chosen to raise them in.

25:03.587 --> 25:06.090
And, um, I would say,

25:06.632 --> 25:09.343
among other things,
I hope we're open-minded.

25:09.426 --> 25:13.263
I mean, I think what draws a lot of people
to Monterey is its progressiveness.

25:14.598 --> 25:18.811
(CLEARS THROAT) But opinions aside,
legally, you've already lost.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.731
The California Constitution goes way further
than the federal one

25:22.815 --> 25:23.941
to protect the First Amendment.

25:24.066 --> 25:26.443
But to answer your question, Renata,
"Who are we?"

25:26.944 --> 25:30.239
I don't think we want to become synonymous
with suppression and prior restraint.

25:30.948 --> 25:36.453
We're going to face accusations of
being anti-American and anti-free speech.

25:37.413 --> 25:40.499
I mean, that's not the politics
that you've been practicing, Mayor Bartley.

25:41.583 --> 25:45.796
So I would say there are bigger black eyes
than putting on a controversial musical.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.340
Especially ones that have won Tonys.

25:51.135 --> 25:52.803
MADELINE: <i>Stick that up your tight ass, bitch.</i>

25:52.928 --> 25:54.471
(BOTH LAUGHING)

25:55.806 --> 25:57.975
You were fucking brilliant.

25:58.809 --> 25:59.977
- Really?
- Um...

26:00.436 --> 26:04.565
Yeah. It's actually kind of annoying that you
look like that, and you're smart and educated

26:04.648 --> 26:07.526
and intelligent and sympathetic.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.778
You even had Cruella
agreeing with you in the end.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.238
Did you see her face?

26:11.321 --> 26:12.823
I mean, come on.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.784
Yeah, thanks.

26:16.702 --> 26:17.828
What?

26:19.371 --> 26:21.665
- What's wrong, honey?
- Nothing, nothing. I'm sorry. God.

26:22.541 --> 26:25.169
Oh! Stop it, Celeste.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.839
I don't know where this is coming from.
I really don't.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.090
(SIGHS)

26:30.174 --> 26:32.134
Or maybe you do, honey.

26:34.553 --> 26:35.637
(GROANS)

26:37.014 --> 26:39.641
It's just for six years,

26:39.725 --> 26:43.187
I've been wiping runny noses,
organizing playdates, doing...

26:44.188 --> 26:45.189
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

26:45.564 --> 26:48.233
Everything to be a good mom, you know?

26:48.692 --> 26:51.195
And today, I felt alive. I felt good.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.947
- Is that crazy?
- No.

26:54.031 --> 26:58.160
I feel so ashamed for saying this,
but being a mother, it's not enough for me.

26:59.328 --> 27:01.330
It's just not. It's not even close.

27:01.872 --> 27:04.291
It's evil, all right? I'm evil.
I've said it out loud.

27:04.374 --> 27:06.919
You are not evil.
I'm not going to let you say that.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.379
What? You think it? Do you? Ever?

27:09.880 --> 27:14.676
Yes.
I got so consumed with Abigail and Chloe,

27:15.552 --> 27:17.346
their lives were everything...

27:17.471 --> 27:18.555
Mmm-hmm.

27:18.639 --> 27:20.307
...that I almost forgot I had my own.

27:20.390 --> 27:24.895
And I just had to do something,
so I decided to volunteer at the theater.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.232
And I'm not a performer. I'm not a director.
I didn't know what to do.

27:28.315 --> 27:30.859
But it just made me feel like
I was doing something.

27:31.068 --> 27:33.070
I wanted more, you know?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.907
I want more of that! That feeling.

27:37.241 --> 27:39.827
-'Cause that made me feel alive, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.746
-(HORN HONKING)
-(LAUGHING)

27:42.830 --> 27:44.248
- I want more!
- Okay.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.001
- Jesus.
- Oh.

27:48.085 --> 27:50.420
- And you know what?
- What?

27:50.754 --> 27:52.756
- You're gonna be a lawyer again.
- No.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.425
I mean, I have never seen you like that.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.428
For four years I've known you, and...

28:00.097 --> 28:02.266
Your face looked different,
your body changed.

28:04.935 --> 28:06.228
- You miss it.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.773
You're right.

28:10.232 --> 28:12.192
I fucking miss it!

28:12.276 --> 28:13.110
-(HORN HONKING)
- Whoo!

28:13.569 --> 28:14.611
Whoo! (ECHOES)

28:18.282 --> 28:19.449
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.

28:19.575 --> 28:22.536
I would've asked you to come to the school,
but it's kind of a fishbowl there.

28:22.619 --> 28:23.954
People can gossip.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.706
What's going on?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.710
I have reason to suspect, and only suspect,

28:29.793 --> 28:32.963
that Amabella Klein is still being bullied.

28:33.088 --> 28:36.884
And that Ziggy may be the culprit.

28:37.968 --> 28:39.219
I haven't seen anything.

28:39.303 --> 28:42.973
But I feel certain
that something is going on with Amabella.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.641
She's made no implications.

28:44.725 --> 28:48.312
In fact,
she claims that she and Ziggy are friends.

28:48.437 --> 28:52.649
Um... And my personal experience of Ziggy,
he is a sweet little boy.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.401
Yes, so then where is all this coming from?

28:54.484 --> 28:58.071
Well, I sensed some tension
between them this morning.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.407
Amabella was visibly upset about something.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.659
I observed Ziggy looking at her.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.078
And from my vantage point,

29:05.162 --> 29:08.332
he appeared to know
exactly what she was upset about.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.085
Maybe he saw her being bullied.
Maybe he was concerned for her.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.755
That could very well be,
though it wasn't my take.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.674
Look, if I think

29:17.925 --> 29:20.344
that a child is being physically

29:21.345 --> 29:22.846
or emotionally abused,

29:22.930 --> 29:25.515
it is my duty to go forward with that,

29:25.849 --> 29:27.684
first and foremost to the parents.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.269
What fucking evidence do you have?

29:29.353 --> 29:32.439
Jane, believe it or not,
I'm actually on your side here.

29:32.522 --> 29:35.776
No, you know what? If you were on my side,
you would not go to Amabella's parents.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.946
That is only going to make things worse.
You would find another solution.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.489
This is ridiculous.

29:42.658 --> 29:43.825
Okay.

29:45.619 --> 29:47.204
Do you have any reason

29:48.038 --> 29:51.375
-to suspect that Ziggy could be violent?
- No.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.961
Maybe something from his past.

29:54.044 --> 29:55.128
No!

29:58.465 --> 30:03.637
Ziggy is a sweet, docile young boy.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.681
He's never hurt a fly.

30:06.974 --> 30:08.809
Wouldn't someone have fucking seen this,
for God's sakes?

30:08.892 --> 30:10.060
They're in a classroom.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.064
Okay, you know what?

30:14.189 --> 30:17.526
Maybe you're gonna think
this is way off-book, but...

30:20.028 --> 30:21.071

30:39.423 --> 30:41.758
Yeah, that's all I need. No, that's perfect.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.219
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

30:46.263 --> 30:47.597
- Isn't she amazing?
-(SIGHS)

30:47.931 --> 30:49.224
Amazing.

30:49.433 --> 30:51.393
I cannot believe she's doing it for free.

30:51.768 --> 30:53.520
She's my best friend.
She'll do whatever I ask.

30:53.603 --> 30:55.772
- What if it goes to court?
-It's not gonna go to court.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.232
That is a done deal.

30:58.191 --> 30:59.568
It's amazing.
You have nothing to worry about.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.612
You're so good to me.

31:03.613 --> 31:04.906
I believe in you.

31:08.118 --> 31:09.786
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.371
Out of nowhere.

31:11.747 --> 31:12.789
I'm still shaking.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.292
One minute we're talking, and then the next...

31:15.417 --> 31:16.710
(CHILDREN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

31:17.210 --> 31:18.795
(SOFTLY) He puts his tongue in my throat.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.257
- This is assault. He assaulted you.
- Mmm.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.219
- I might've kissed him back.
- What?

31:26.470 --> 31:29.347
It was, like, a reflex, you know.
Somebody kisses you, you kiss them back.

31:30.015 --> 31:32.184
- I might've grabbed his ass. I don't know.
- What?

31:32.267 --> 31:33.894
It just all happened so fast.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.730
And the next thing I know,
he has his hand in my shirt.

31:38.148 --> 31:40.067
Or was it my hand in his shirt?

31:40.233 --> 31:42.527
-(LAUGHS)
- What? It was a reflex.

31:42.611 --> 31:43.695
Ugh!

31:43.779 --> 31:45.405
So you're saying the thing's mutual.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.492
No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.745
I'm in love with you. You hear me?
I'm in love with you, Madeline. I have been...

31:51.828 --> 31:52.871
For months?

31:54.164 --> 31:55.499
So I slapped him.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.626
What? (LAUGHS)

31:59.252 --> 32:00.837
This is not funny, Celeste.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.548
I'm a married woman,
and he forced himself on me.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.260
Okay, "forced himself"
maybe is the wrong word.

32:07.636 --> 32:09.429
But I hated every minute of it.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.140
- I didn't.
- Afternoon, ladies.

32:12.224 --> 32:14.017
- Hi, Perry.
- Hi.

32:14.601 --> 32:16.061
- What am I missing?
- Nothing.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.105
Nothing. She's always laughing at me.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.858
She's my best audience,
and apparently I'm a very funny girl.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.151
Uh-huh.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.654
How fun was it in court today?

32:25.904 --> 32:26.947
It wasn't court.

32:27.030 --> 32:30.450
She was incredible, Perry.
You should've seen her. She was amazing.

32:30.867 --> 32:33.703
She doesn't know when to stop laughing.
She was amazing.

32:34.746 --> 32:36.039
I kind of already knew that.

32:36.373 --> 32:39.126
It wasn't court, it was a meeting.
And it went very well, and it's done now.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.377
- Right?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:40.877 --> 32:44.881
If my baby makes up her mind to do
something, you better get out of her way.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.884
- Hey! My little men!
- I made an ollie today.

32:47.968 --> 32:50.095
- Wow!
- I made a noseslide.

32:50.178 --> 32:52.472
I don't even know what that is,
but it's really exciting.

32:52.889 --> 32:55.308
- Mom, did you film all this?
- No. No, ldidn't.

32:55.392 --> 32:56.518
MAX: I want to show you, Dad. Come on!

32:56.601 --> 32:58.895
I want to see it,
but let's do it after dinner.

32:59.312 --> 33:01.565
I'm just gonna chill with Mommy for a second
and funny Maddie.

33:01.648 --> 33:02.816
- No, Dad, come on.
- Dad!

33:02.899 --> 33:05.735
- PERRY: All right, all right, all right.
- There will be wine waiting for you.

33:05.819 --> 33:08.321
- We're gonna go work on our noseslides now.
- Bye, Daddy.

33:08.405 --> 33:10.240
Bye. All right, outside.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.784
- He's such a great dad.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:14.578 --> 33:15.996
So...

33:16.079 --> 33:17.581

34:16.139 --> 34:18.891
What's the matter? Let me see. Let me see.

34:21.186 --> 34:24.231
There's no blood. Take a deep breath.
Come here.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.400
Should we go to the hospital?
I think we should call the ambulance.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.320
- I think we need to call 911.
-(CHUCKLES) No.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.989
I think we should.
Should I call the Tooth Fairy?

34:33.281 --> 34:34.908
- No.
- Or Santa Claus?

34:35.909 --> 34:37.159
I'm sorry, buddy.

34:38.954 --> 34:41.539
Last time we had pizza
and we went to the zoo,

34:41.956 --> 34:43.833
you told me we were moving to Monterey.

34:44.417 --> 34:45.668
What now?

34:49.005 --> 34:51.549
You're going to go see a child psychologist.

34:54.928 --> 34:57.472
BONNIE: I think he plans on signing up
for a class, that's all.

34:57.973 --> 35:00.558
Did he hit on you at all? What did he say?

35:03.311 --> 35:06.564
Just that it should fall to me and him
to keep the peace at this dinner.

35:07.190 --> 35:08.316
I don't disagree.

35:08.733 --> 35:09.776
(SCOFFS)

35:11.486 --> 35:14.197
Did he say anything off at all?

35:15.198 --> 35:16.283
Or cross you in any way?

35:16.366 --> 35:17.867
'Cause I'd love to have a reason
to pop him one.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.494
Nathan Carlson.

35:19.953 --> 35:22.080
I'm saying the guy's off, Bonnie.
Come on, admit it.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.042
The whole point of this dinner
is so we can all get along, okay?

35:26.126 --> 35:28.211
Not so you can "pop him one."

35:28.837 --> 35:29.879
The guy's off.

35:29.963 --> 35:32.382
At some point,
boundaries are gonna have to be set.

35:34.134 --> 35:35.844
Hey. Hey, where you going?

35:36.052 --> 35:37.846
- I'm going to Becky's.
- Becky.

35:38.096 --> 35:39.556
Wait, is she the stupid one?

35:40.265 --> 35:42.976
Your mom's always nagging me about letting
you hang outwith stupid people.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.602
Well, she's still upset about the tutor.

35:45.228 --> 35:47.731
- Hey, what do you have there? What are you...
- ABIGAIL: Nothing.

35:48.064 --> 35:49.649
What are you carrying, darling?

35:51.234 --> 35:52.485
ABIGAIL: Nothing.

35:53.236 --> 35:54.612
I can check my bar.

36:01.536 --> 36:02.579
What?

36:05.373 --> 36:06.583
What?

36:06.875 --> 36:08.668
You need to relax.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.797
We don't want anyone getting hurt, do we?

36:14.090 --> 36:15.675
You know, we can always move.

36:16.968 --> 36:19.262
- We don't have to live in Monterey.
- Really?

36:19.596 --> 36:20.847
Yeah.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.474
You want to move?

36:23.933 --> 36:26.728
Okay, first of all, Skye loves it here. A lot.

36:27.395 --> 36:29.981
Second of all, we're never gonna find
public schools this good.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.941
And third, what about Abigail?

36:32.275 --> 36:33.902
She goes back with her mom?

36:34.402 --> 36:35.820
She'll just move away with us.

36:37.530 --> 36:39.407
That'll be the last straw for ex-thing.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.830
Okay. All right.

36:47.457 --> 36:49.542
- That is a lot to fantasize...
- Stop.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.050
Whatcha doing?

36:57.550 --> 37:00.261
MADELINE: Nothing.
Just staring at the sunset,

37:02.055 --> 37:04.849
thinking how lucky we are
to have that in our face every day.

37:05.475 --> 37:07.018
That is not what you were thinking.

37:17.654 --> 37:19.656
Abby know you go on her Facebook page?

37:20.281 --> 37:21.324
Probably.

37:21.408 --> 37:24.202
I leave comments sometimes.
Though under an alias.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.454
What's the alias?

37:27.122 --> 37:28.373
- God.
-(CHUCKLES)

37:30.250 --> 37:32.502
So, you went to visit Bonnie

37:33.002 --> 37:34.838
-at her studio?
- Wow.

37:36.047 --> 37:37.674
No secrets in this town.

37:38.925 --> 37:41.803
I was thinking about doing a sit-up
and wanted to get her advice.

37:44.180 --> 37:47.767
Went to talk about the dinner
and how to best avoid friction.

37:48.518 --> 37:49.686
Or animosity.

37:50.562 --> 37:53.857
- Violence?
- Exactly how psychotic do you think I am?

37:56.109 --> 37:57.152
Mmm.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.364
Come on.

38:13.042 --> 38:14.377
You doing okay, Maddie?

38:17.297 --> 38:18.423
Tell me.

38:19.048 --> 38:21.092
Tell me. I'll make you feel good, baby.

38:23.386 --> 38:25.388
I just feel like I'm...

38:26.514 --> 38:28.391
Losing control a little bit.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.185
Of?

38:31.478 --> 38:32.687
What I am.

38:35.773 --> 38:36.983
How so?

38:41.196 --> 38:42.405
I don't know.

- No, it looks incredible.

It's funny how clothes
always seem to do that on you.

40:06.739 --> 40:07.991
You're sweet.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.326
What's the occasion?

40:11.035 --> 40:14.247
I have a meeting with the attorney
representing the town.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.044
- Another meeting, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:20.878 --> 40:22.547
I think we're gonna settle it today.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.258
Yeah?

40:26.175 --> 40:28.177
- What if it doesn't settle?
- Oh.

40:28.553 --> 40:31.014
Well, we'd probably go to court,
but it would just be a one-off.

40:32.223 --> 40:33.725
They really don't have any grounds.

40:34.892 --> 40:36.394
So, a court appearance now?

40:37.520 --> 40:40.106
Probably not, but what's the big deal?

40:42.025 --> 40:44.027
Well, the big deal is that you lied to me.

40:44.694 --> 40:45.820
You said it'd be one meeting yesterday,

40:45.903 --> 40:47.447
and then it'd be over with.
Now you're going to court.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.449
I never said that.
I said I thought it would go away quickly,

40:49.532 --> 40:50.908
and I still believe that it will.

40:57.624 --> 41:00.543
CELESTE: Okay, let's go, sweetie.
PERRY: Hey, champ.

41:01.586 --> 41:03.379
- Bye, Dad.
- Have a great day.

41:03.963 --> 41:05.381
We're going to be late.

41:05.757 --> 41:07.383
Come on. Quick, quick.

41:07.717 --> 41:08.885
Let's go.

41:12.388 --> 41:13.556
Bye.

41:23.608 --> 41:24.651
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

41:26.569 --> 41:27.570
(INHALES)

41:42.293 --> 41:43.336
(DOOR OPENS)

41:44.420 --> 41:45.755
Ms Chapman?

41:47.090 --> 41:48.299
Come on in.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.095
We had a nice conversation.

41:52.762 --> 41:57.350
- He's a very smart little guy.
- Yeah.

41:58.309 --> 41:59.602
Please.

42:00.770 --> 42:01.938
Have a seat.

42:08.653 --> 42:12.657
I can see that you're nervous,
so I'm just gonna out right to the punchline.

42:12.949 --> 42:15.785
I do not think Ziggy is a bully.

42:17.036 --> 42:20.289
I brought up the incident
that you had mentioned at orientation,

42:20.373 --> 42:22.625
and he made it very clear it wasn't him.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.460
And I'd be surprised if he's lying.

42:25.294 --> 42:29.549
If so, he's the most accomplished liar
I have ever seen.

42:30.299 --> 42:34.971
And frankly, he doesn't show any of
the classic signs of a bullying personality.

42:35.054 --> 42:36.681
He's not narcissistic.

42:36.806 --> 42:40.309
And he certainly demonstrates
empathy and sensitivity.

42:42.854 --> 42:43.896
(SOBS)

42:44.063 --> 42:45.481
Sorry. (CHUCKLES)

42:47.859 --> 42:49.152
Are you sure?

42:49.986 --> 42:51.320
I'm pretty sure.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.699
I definitely would like to see him
for another appointment.

42:55.491 --> 42:57.869
I think he's suffering from a lot of anxiety,

42:57.994 --> 43:00.204
and I believe that there is...

43:00.496 --> 43:02.999
There's a lot he didn't share with me today.

43:03.416 --> 43:07.003
And I wouldn't be surprised to learn
that he himself is being bullied at school.

43:07.670 --> 43:10.506
Ziggy?
- I could be wrong, but I wouldn't be shocked.

43:11.007 --> 43:12.550
My guess is that it's verbal,

43:13.009 --> 43:16.512
and that some smart kid
has found his weak spot.

43:17.889 --> 43:19.682
He also brought up his father.

43:20.892 --> 43:22.351
Who, uh...

43:22.727 --> 43:25.688
Believe it or not,
he thinks might be Darth Vader.

43:26.022 --> 43:27.565
(LAUGHS) What?

43:27.690 --> 43:31.527
Children often get caught halfway
between fantasy and reality.

43:31.778 --> 43:32.945
And he's only six.

43:33.029 --> 43:36.699
And I asked him if the two of you
talk much about his father.

43:37.909 --> 43:39.202
He said it upset you.

43:39.952 --> 43:41.871
And that you're not saying much about him.

43:42.121 --> 43:44.207
Yeah, it's very complicated, so...

43:44.749 --> 43:50.630
He said that, "Be aware that if
we're talking to my mom about my dad,

43:50.713 --> 43:54.258
"that, uh, she's gonna get a funny look
on her face."

43:55.676 --> 43:57.386
So I take it that, uh,

43:57.929 --> 44:00.723
Ziggy's father isn't exactly a good guy.

44:01.390 --> 44:03.059
No, not exactly.

44:05.228 --> 44:07.396
And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.

44:08.231 --> 44:09.607
Yeah, no, he never will.

44:12.276 --> 44:15.863
Well, as I said, I think you have a...

44:16.364 --> 44:18.366
A caring, sweet little boy on your hands.

44:19.367 --> 44:20.868
But I would like to see him again.

44:22.286 --> 44:23.579
Okay.

44:24.247 --> 44:25.748
You wanna see him?

44:27.959 --> 44:29.043
(DOOR OPENS)

44:29.919 --> 44:31.420
- DR. MORIARTY: Ziggy?
- Hi.

44:33.881 --> 44:35.758
We'll call him Giant Harry the Hippo.

44:36.425 --> 44:37.426
(JANE LAUGHS)

44:38.928 --> 44:40.221
JOSEPH: Maddie.

44:41.889 --> 44:43.683
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

44:43.766 --> 44:45.268
Have you been following me?

44:45.393 --> 44:46.811
- No, I haven't been following you.
- Oh, my God.

44:46.936 --> 44:48.938
Well, I want to talk to you
about what I did at the theater.

44:49.063 --> 44:52.149
- You can't do this out of nowhere!
-It was unacceptable. inexcusable.

44:52.608 --> 44:55.319
That said, it didn't happen in a vacuum.

44:56.112 --> 44:59.073
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean, Madeline. Come on.

44:59.156 --> 45:01.242
What happened a year ago was an accident.

45:01.325 --> 45:03.786
I told you that was a mistake
that's not going to be repeated again.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.621
Well, it was repeated, several times.

45:05.746 --> 45:08.165
Okay, stop. It's been erased.

45:09.333 --> 45:10.960
- Erased?
- Yes, it didn't happen.

45:11.085 --> 45:12.670
I am a happily married woman.

45:12.795 --> 45:14.130
- Really?
- Yes.

45:16.966 --> 45:20.177
You know what? You told me you agreed
that you were not going to open this up again.

45:20.303 --> 45:21.971
Well, I don't agree anymore.

45:22.805 --> 45:25.474
All right, you know what?
You stay in your life, I'll stay in mine.

45:25.683 --> 45:26.976
Hey.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.275
<i>CELESTE". My major concern is as to
how he might react.</i>

45:35.484 --> 45:37.320
To the idea that you want to go back to work?

45:37.653 --> 45:42.992
What did he say, his words exactly?
That he was afraid of me, um...

45:44.660 --> 45:46.162
- Going through him.
- Ah.

45:46.370 --> 45:47.455
(SCOFFS)

45:48.789 --> 45:50.666
Yeah, so I'm...

45:51.959 --> 45:55.129
I suppose I'm just worried
that he's gonna take it as a rejection.

45:56.130 --> 45:59.383
You were working when he first met you
and when he fell in love with you, right?

45:59.508 --> 46:00.635
Yeah.

46:00.718 --> 46:02.178
But he, um...

46:03.471 --> 46:07.183
He just likes me to be at home in the house,
and we have the twins, and...

46:10.895 --> 46:13.481
He's not that crazy about me
having too many friends.

46:13.564 --> 46:15.483
He's just possessive.
That's who he is, so...

46:17.318 --> 46:19.487
And I hope that you'd have some ideas

46:19.570 --> 46:23.866
on the best way to communicate with him
about me going back to work.

46:25.826 --> 46:26.869
No?

46:27.203 --> 46:32.083
Well, I could certainly suggest some
communicative tools,

46:32.541 --> 46:33.918
but...

46:34.418 --> 46:37.046
For me, the issue isn't how best
to talk to your husband,

46:37.171 --> 46:38.673
but why you're afraid to.

46:42.009 --> 46:43.552
I'm not, um...

46:44.553 --> 46:46.722
I'm not afraid. I'm just...

46:49.225 --> 46:50.393
I just want to have...

46:50.851 --> 46:53.729
I suppose I want to communicate it
in the best way that's...

46:55.731 --> 46:56.941
Okay.

46:58.442 --> 46:59.777
I'm not afraid.

47:01.529 --> 47:06.033
The week leading up to Trivia Night,
something changed with Celeste.

47:06.701 --> 47:09.578
Still beautiful. But in her face...

47:09.704 --> 47:10.746
Her eyes...

47:10.871 --> 47:14.125
Not a look like she could actually
kill somebody, but, um...

47:37.898 --> 47:39.567
JANE: Yeah, I think it's him.

47:40.735 --> 47:42.403
If I heard his voice...

47:43.571 --> 47:47.408
I can still remember his voice. I can also
still remember that disgusting smell.

47:48.951 --> 47:50.619
Where did you say he lived?

47:50.745 --> 47:52.121
San Luis Obispo.

47:54.790 --> 47:56.417
You're not thinking about going down there?
