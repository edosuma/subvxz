00:18.050 --> 00:19.249
So, I thought

00:19.265 --> 00:21.104
Trish could sit here,

00:21.105 --> 00:22.544
Neil can sit here

00:22.545 --> 00:23.624
and Simon...

00:23.625 --> 00:24.704
'The ex-boyfriend.'

00:24.705 --> 00:25.744
can sit there.

00:25.745 --> 00:28.304
And if anyone tries to move
from the seating plan,

00:28.305 --> 00:29.504
I'll taser them.

00:29.505 --> 00:30.624
Mark,

00:30.625 --> 00:34.584
I think you need to take a chill
pill from your frankly
inadequate supply.

00:34.585 --> 00:36.904
Sorry, yes, I guess I am a bit
nervous,

00:36.905 --> 00:40.904
cos this is the first time we've
hosted a social evening
together

00:41.145 --> 00:43.424
in our soon-to-be-joint home.

00:43.425 --> 00:44.664
Don't sweat it, dude.

00:44.665 --> 00:48.504
Oh, by the way, Simon's
invited me to come away for
the weekend for his thirtieth.

00:48.505 --> 00:49.784
'Sex with the ex.'

00:49.785 --> 00:52.184
Yeah? You... and him?

00:52.185 --> 00:53.224
And the whole website gang.

00:53.225 --> 00:56.544
Oh, thank God. I've a website
opportunity, actually.

00:56.545 --> 00:58.344
Super Hans has sorted us out
a website.

00:58.345 --> 01:00.584
And get this - it's empty.

01:00.585 --> 01:01.704
Right. Yeah.

01:01.705 --> 01:04.304
He's wangled us a website
for us to do shit on.

01:04.305 --> 01:06.384
Business, creative. Whatever.

01:06.385 --> 01:07.664
Totally blank.

01:07.665 --> 01:09.304
Big opportunity. You in?

01:09.305 --> 01:13.024
Yes, Jez, I guess that would
be an exciting opportunity,

01:13.025 --> 01:17.024
if it was the last website ever.

01:18.465 --> 01:21.184
I mean they say, y'know, cut him
some slack, cos he was in the
Beatles, but...

01:21.185 --> 01:23.904
Finally, the use
of Jeremy and Hans becomes clear.

01:23.905 --> 01:27.464
They're my normality cloaks,
allowing me to slip into
human society

01:27.465 --> 01:31.104
and wreak my evil
doings/make friends and
relax.

01:31.105 --> 01:33.264
Nice place, Mark. So many
biscuits!

01:33.265 --> 01:35.384
Is this a normal night for you?

01:35.385 --> 01:38.464
Yeah. Oh... yeah,
me and my guys

01:38.465 --> 01:39.584
and our...

01:39.585 --> 01:41.544
cannabis.

01:41.545 --> 01:43.264
No, thanks. I'm full.

01:43.265 --> 01:44.384
You're full?

01:44.385 --> 01:46.424
I-I never stone alone.

01:46.425 --> 01:48.104
I'm just high on pie.

01:48.105 --> 01:50.024
What?

01:50.025 --> 01:51.904
Bad to worse,
I'm speaking in verse.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.624
Saying a rhyme ain't a crime.

01:53.625 --> 01:56.024
If I can say it to you,
it must be true.

01:56.025 --> 01:57.504
'Am I sort of rapping?'

01:57.505 --> 01:59.744
I'm... thinking of joining a gym,

01:59.745 --> 02:03.464
get back on a... positive track.

02:03.465 --> 02:07.304
I've always suspected that
getting on a positive track
is a good idea.

02:07.305 --> 02:09.943
But now I'm a
professional life coach,

02:09.945 --> 02:11.064
I can confirm,

02:11.065 --> 02:12.504
you know, medically,

02:12.505 --> 02:14.384
that it is a good idea.

02:14.385 --> 02:18.384
Y'know, if you ever want to
speak to anyone, I am a fully
qualified life coach.

02:19.225 --> 02:22.184
'Yes, and I printed
his qualification as a treat.'

02:22.185 --> 02:24.144
There's a quarter there.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.784
And if you weigh it, it will
appear to come in light,
cos it's helium weed.

02:27.785 --> 02:31.344
Tell you what, Hans, Jez,
you should come to my
thirtieth.

02:31.345 --> 02:32.384
And you, Mark.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.944
Paintball till we drop

02:33.945 --> 02:35.184
and then smoke till we pop.

02:35.185 --> 02:36.864
Wicked. Cool.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.304
Great.
'Ugh, paintballing weekend?

02:39.305 --> 02:41.024
'It's so obvious he fancies
Dobby.

02:41.025 --> 02:43.784
'He's just using it as cover.
But he won't be expecting

02:43.785 --> 02:46.744
'how incredibly taciturn
and deflating I can be

02:46.745 --> 02:47.904
'in social situations.

02:47.905 --> 02:51.344
'The fun stops here,
my friend.'

02:51.345 --> 02:54.064
Yeah, I mean, I really just
want a... honest broker,

02:54.065 --> 02:55.664
someone to chat through
some shit with.

02:55.665 --> 02:58.784
'Is it OK, the bed?
Is it a bit like at any moment

02:58.785 --> 03:02.624
'I might jump on him and
hump him better? I could hump him.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.024
'I wonder if I'll hump many
clients.'

03:04.025 --> 03:05.944
and I've always really
wanted to do footy coaching,

03:05.945 --> 03:09.584
and I've got the first FA
badge, but it's hard.

03:09.585 --> 03:11.024
OK.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.824
So what seems to be
stopping you?

03:12.825 --> 03:13.944
Well, I've got my job.

03:13.945 --> 03:15.944
Well, quit your job.
You think so?

03:15.945 --> 03:17.944
Definitely. You've got to follow
your dream.

03:17.945 --> 03:19.784
'Case closed. Next!'

03:19.785 --> 03:21.704
I mean, it's hard to find
paid coaching work,

03:21.705 --> 03:25.704
and, um, Alice, my wife, she
wonders if it's not a bit late to
get into all this.

03:26.865 --> 03:29.344
'OK, might have a poke about
a bit.'

03:29.345 --> 03:32.624
How are things in the
relationship?

03:32.625 --> 03:36.264
Oh, um... OK, I guess.

03:36.265 --> 03:39.304
I mean... not always great.

03:39.305 --> 03:42.544
No. Right. Of course not.

03:42.545 --> 03:43.744
'Can I get into the bedroom?'

03:43.745 --> 03:46.944
Tell me about the sexual side
of the relationship.

03:46.945 --> 03:48.224
Well, to be honest,

03:48.225 --> 03:49.624
it's... it's not good.

03:49.625 --> 03:50.904
'This is great!

03:50.905 --> 03:52.824
'I can ask him anything I want,

03:52.825 --> 03:55.104
'cos I'm the professional
and he's the worm in the
science beaker.'

03:55.105 --> 03:56.224
Go on.

03:56.225 --> 03:59.304
Well, look, I mean... I guess I
can say...

03:59.305 --> 04:00.864
I like to be...

04:00.865 --> 04:02.464
dominated.

04:02.465 --> 04:03.984
In the bedroom.
'Course you do,'

04:03.985 --> 04:07.064
'you filthy bastard.'
There's no judgment here,
Neil.

04:07.065 --> 04:10.544
I've also experimented
with same-sex experiences.

04:10.545 --> 04:12.304
'Whoo, tell me more!'

04:12.305 --> 04:14.784
So, in the relationship,

04:14.785 --> 04:18.103
do you think you're getting
really fulfilled?

04:18.105 --> 04:21.224
Alice has this medical
condition which makes...

04:21.225 --> 04:23.064
We don't need to go into that.
That's not part of it.

04:23.065 --> 04:24.704
Right. What is part of it?

04:24.705 --> 04:26.384
I'll... tell you what's part of it.

04:26.385 --> 04:29.824
Now, tell me more about
these gay feelings. They
sound interesting.

04:29.825 --> 04:31.864
I mean important.
I suppose...

04:31.865 --> 04:35.344
I mean, I was hoping to talk
about the footy coaching,
but...

04:35.345 --> 04:37.184
I mean, everything's connected.

04:37.185 --> 04:38.344
Um...

04:38.345 --> 04:39.784
A relationship...

04:39.785 --> 04:41.464
it, er...

04:41.465 --> 04:43.424
Well, a relationship... it's...

04:43.425 --> 04:45.384
it has, um...
'Where am I going here?'

04:45.385 --> 04:49.384
A relation-ship is a lot like a
real ship.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.904
It needs to be moving forward,

04:51.905 --> 04:54.584
it needs to be properly
maintained.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.504
Yes.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.424
Yeah! I get that.

04:58.425 --> 05:01.104
'He gets that? I'm a life
coach!'

05:01.105 --> 05:04.824
I mean, the truth is, I have
had thoughts about leaving
Alice.

05:04.825 --> 05:08.264
If you sometimes want to do
something,

05:08.265 --> 05:09.384
you should do it.

05:09.385 --> 05:10.744
Yes?
Yes.

05:10.745 --> 05:14.504
What you sometimes think
you should do is what you
should do.

05:14.579 --> 05:17.671
That's at the very core
of the Usbourne philosophy.

05:17.745 --> 05:21.744
'Kiss my cheeks, Dr Freud,
I'm on fire.'

05:22.145 --> 05:25.864
'That's not my fault.
I was definitely on fire.'

05:25.865 --> 05:28.064
So, Neil broke up with Alice.

05:28.065 --> 05:30.744
She's in tears in Crofton Park,
apparently.

05:30.745 --> 05:32.184
Because you told him to leave
her.

05:32.185 --> 05:35.984
It was his idea. I
just... encouraged him to
believe in himself.

05:35.986 --> 05:37.545
You've got nothing, no weed
at all?

05:37.546 --> 05:39.505
I'm not Muffin the fucking
drugs mule, mate.

05:39.601 --> 05:40.800
Why do you think I invited you?

05:40.801 --> 05:44.080
For my off-key remarks and
crazy insights?

05:44.081 --> 05:45.680
Jez, man...
Oh, shit.

05:45.681 --> 05:48.480
Can we grab five?
Cos my head's in fucking
pieces.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.920
You want to book in a session
next week, or...?

05:50.921 --> 05:52.720
I'm really starting to regret
leaving Alice.

05:52.721 --> 05:56.280
Uh-huh.
I really think it was
a... terrible idea.

05:56.281 --> 05:58.640
Sorry, dude, but you're kind
of harshing my mellow.

05:58.641 --> 05:59.880
She says she won't have me
back.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.320
Yeah, I feel for you,
but I'm off the clock.

06:01.321 --> 06:02.400
What shall I do?

06:02.401 --> 06:05.320
Park it, Neil. Save it till,
I don't know, Wednesday.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.880
OK, OK, everyone,

06:06.881 --> 06:09.200
hat game. Hat's full of band
names.

06:09.201 --> 06:11.920
'Paintballing and the hat
game? Terrific...'

06:11.921 --> 06:13.520
So, teams are

06:13.521 --> 06:14.680
Jeremy and Super Hans,

06:14.681 --> 06:17.240
Mark and Neil, me and

06:17.241 --> 06:19.080
Mrs Dob-Dobalina. Sorry,
hon.

06:19.081 --> 06:20.160
'Obviously.

06:20.161 --> 06:24.120
'And no doubt the prize/forfeit
for the losing/winning team

06:24.121 --> 06:26.440
'is languorous copulation.'
OK.

06:26.441 --> 06:29.040
Time starts... now.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.720
OK, you probably
love them, and fair do's.

06:31.721 --> 06:33.280
Elbow.
Correct.

06:33.281 --> 06:35.480
'Ugh, Elbow. Elbow, Elbow,
Elbow.

06:35.481 --> 06:37.920
'Should I get an Elbow CD?
Probably.

06:37.921 --> 06:40.480
'And The Killing and Mad Men

06:40.481 --> 06:43.120
'and an iPad and everything.
God, why won't everyone
leave me alone?'

06:43.121 --> 06:45.800
Hipsters, flavour of the
month, still going strong.

06:45.801 --> 06:47.440
Boards of Canada!
Word!

06:47.441 --> 06:49.000
'Oh, Christ.'

06:49.001 --> 06:50.280
Poor man's Talking Heads.

06:50.281 --> 06:52.680
No proper names.
Over and out.

06:52.681 --> 06:54.120
Right, Jez and Hans.

06:54.121 --> 06:55.520
Go.
Er, widely acknowledged

06:55.521 --> 06:56.800
to have nicked our sound.

06:56.801 --> 06:58.720
The Chemical Brothers.
Correct.

06:58.721 --> 07:00.560
Er, bullshitters turning wank
into cash.

07:00.561 --> 07:01.840
Flaming Lips?
Correct.

07:01.841 --> 07:02.960
Oh. Arsehole.

07:02.961 --> 07:04.720
LCD Soundsystem.
Fakers.

07:04.721 --> 07:07.400
Pavement.
Yeah. Oh, we thought we
had her number

07:07.401 --> 07:09.240
and you got a bit overexcited,

07:09.241 --> 07:10.440
but it turned out to be
a not very funny joke.

07:10.441 --> 07:11.800
Lily Allen.
Correct.

07:11.801 --> 07:13.520
Phoneys.
Foo Fighters.

07:13.521 --> 07:15.440
Oh. Demanded the Ramsgate
blow job.

07:15.441 --> 07:17.320
Mumford & Sons?
Mm.

07:17.321 --> 07:19.600
That's your lot.
'I'm so good at this.'

07:19.601 --> 07:20.840
'But I bet not one person here

07:20.841 --> 07:22.600
is gonna give me a blow job.'

07:22.601 --> 07:25.480
OK, Mark, Neil, you are up.

07:25.481 --> 07:27.200
'And so the descent into Hell
begins.

07:27.201 --> 07:28.400
'I just hope they're all Snow
Patrol.

07:28.401 --> 07:31.640
'If it's not Snow Patrol or the
Beatles, I am so fucked.'

07:31.641 --> 07:34.600
All right, er, fading fortunes,
but...

07:34.601 --> 07:37.960
Snow Patrol?
New release expected in
about...

07:37.961 --> 07:41.960
The Beatles?
Er, four... releases, big
with...

07:42.641 --> 07:45.440
the men who might be
what you find as relief in the
desert...?

07:45.441 --> 07:47.800
Oasis! I've got one. Oasis!

07:47.801 --> 07:48.880
Good. Big with them.

07:48.881 --> 07:52.240
What? Big with them? Big
with Oasis?

07:52.241 --> 07:55.880
Right, who are Oasis's
favourite bands? Um...

07:55.881 --> 07:57.000
'This is completely
impossible.'

07:57.001 --> 07:59.360
Have I said Snow Patrol?
I have, haven't I?

07:59.361 --> 08:00.920
Um...

08:00.921 --> 08:03.040
Not the Rolling Stones,
obviously. Um...

08:03.041 --> 08:04.960
Er...
OK.

08:04.961 --> 08:06.160
Moving on. Kasabian.

08:06.161 --> 08:08.480
Ah, Kasabian! Of course,
Kasabian.

08:08.481 --> 08:10.080
Kasabian, Kasabian, Kasabian.

08:10.081 --> 08:13.360
OK, um, hipsters with
attitude, er, electro sounds.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.840
It's not Snow Patrol, is it?
No.

08:14.841 --> 08:17.000
Madonna.
Group. Five-piece, I think.

08:17.001 --> 08:21.000
OK, so not the Beatles, cos,
famously, they were a
four-piece.

08:21.561 --> 08:23.000
A bit of trivia.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.680
Er, Susan Doyle. Boyle!

08:24.681 --> 08:26.160
What?
Sorry, my mind's

08:26.161 --> 08:28.840
just drowning in bands. All
the bands.

08:28.841 --> 08:29.920
Er, nice videos, very cool.

08:29.921 --> 08:31.360
Meat Loaf. Kate Bush.

08:31.361 --> 08:32.520
Bald guy in the video?

08:32.520 --> 08:33.840
Hot Chocolate.
Are they a band?

08:33.841 --> 08:35.000
Of course they're a band!

08:35.001 --> 08:37.840
OK, um, clue.

08:37.841 --> 08:40.480
They're warm, very warm.
Nation's favourite food.

08:40.481 --> 08:41.720
Hot Potato?

08:41.721 --> 08:44.280
Boiling Potato. Hot Pie.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.320
Hot Pies.

08:45.321 --> 08:47.440
Hot Potato. Hot Potato.
Stop saying "Hot Potato".

08:47.441 --> 08:48.960
T'Pau!

08:48.961 --> 08:50.960
Come on, you must know, it's
so easy.

08:50.961 --> 08:52.400
Cool electro, improvise live.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.880
I don't know. OK? I don't
know. I don't know.

08:54.881 --> 08:56.920
I don't know, so fuck off!

08:56.921 --> 08:59.480
Um, time's up.

08:59.481 --> 09:00.520
Hot Chip?

09:00.521 --> 09:02.720
Ah, yeah, OK.

09:02.721 --> 09:04.440
I thought it might be Hot
Chips.

09:04.441 --> 09:06.160
'Round one to you, Simon.

09:06.161 --> 09:08.640
'Next time we do a quiz,
it'll be on Napoleon.

09:08.641 --> 09:10.680
'And while you might scrape
through a few Waterloo
questions,

09:10.681 --> 09:14.200
'when I pin you down on
the emperor's domestic
reforms,

09:14.201 --> 09:17.800
'I will fuck you very hard in
the mouth.'

09:17.801 --> 09:21.800
When I woke up, Dobby was
already having a coffee and a
joint with Simon.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.360
They found some dope?
My dope.

09:24.361 --> 09:27.000
I drove to Brighton at 7:30 to
buy some.

09:27.001 --> 09:30.760
Half an ounce of hash for a
blim of approval. God, I hate
myself.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.560
You shouldn't hate yourself,
man.

09:32.561 --> 09:33.800
Stop life-coaching him,
Jeremy.

09:33.801 --> 09:34.760
I'm not!

09:34.761 --> 09:36.440
Hey, guys.

09:36.441 --> 09:37.880
'At last, military strategy.'

09:37.881 --> 09:40.280
'You're on my turf, music
geeks.'

09:40.281 --> 09:41.760
All right, Neil?
No.

09:41.761 --> 09:43.600
I've left 36 messages for
Alice.

09:43.601 --> 09:47.600
Great. Well, that's clearly
all part of your particular
process,

09:47.841 --> 09:50.600
so well done. That's all
normal and good.

09:50.601 --> 09:51.960
'Possibly.'

09:51.961 --> 09:54.200
We've sorted out the teams -
you're Reds.

09:54.201 --> 09:57.640
It's ten minutes to scatter,
then let the death hunt
commence.

09:57.641 --> 09:58.720
"Death hunt"?

09:58.721 --> 10:02.040
'Mm, the death hunt. That sounds
relaxing and fun!'

10:02.041 --> 10:03.520
Sorry, Mark, I'm Yellow.

10:03.521 --> 10:04.560
Look out for the grenades.

10:04.561 --> 10:05.840
Grenades?

10:05.841 --> 10:07.600
Can we have some grenades?

10:07.601 --> 10:08.760
This is a private stash.

10:08.761 --> 10:10.040
We want one of those.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.760
I'm happy to pay.

10:11.761 --> 10:13.240
Pay? Who you gonna pay?

10:13.241 --> 10:15.320
I don't know, the... men?

10:15.321 --> 10:17.440
There aren't any men here,
dude, it's just us.

10:17.441 --> 10:19.640
No men? Not even "a man"?

10:19.641 --> 10:20.880
We're going off-road!

10:20.881 --> 10:22.120
There's no rules.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.800
Just take out every member
of the opposite team to win.

10:24.801 --> 10:26.040
'And by that she means me.'

10:26.041 --> 10:27.680
Death hunt!

10:27.681 --> 10:28.760
Death hunt!

10:28.761 --> 10:32.200
Dobs, this isn't fair! Look at
us!

10:32.201 --> 10:34.120
Yellow team, move out!

10:34.121 --> 10:36.640
'Holding hands? That's not
military!

10:36.641 --> 10:38.200
'I'm pretty sure Rommel
never held hands.'

10:38.201 --> 10:40.720
Why does there have to be
a death hunt, Mark?

10:40.797 --> 10:42.376
Why does war even exist?

10:42.406 --> 10:43.445
Why can't we all just

10:43.446 --> 10:47.285
have a game of footy, like
how England beat Germany
for the First World War?

10:47.286 --> 10:49.125
I don't know how to answer
that, Jeremy.

10:52.034 --> 10:55.353
'Oh, this is a paintballing
nightmare! Must escape.'

10:55.403 --> 10:57.642
'Must not die.
Enjoy the relaxing game.'

10:57.688 --> 10:59.247
'Keep girlfriend from ex sex.'

10:59.248 --> 11:01.867
We're coming to paint you,
shitheads!

11:01.920 --> 11:03.239
'Oh, yes, a ditch!'

11:03.560 --> 11:07.259
'I should burrow further and further
into the earth, like the worm I am.'

11:07.271 --> 11:09.470
- Mark? It's me.
- Hans?

11:09.471 --> 11:13.150
I think I've just spotted
some kind of bunker.

11:13.151 --> 11:17.150
Brilliant!

11:17.751 --> 11:19.670
I wonder if Simon found a bunker.

11:19.671 --> 11:22.750
I wonder if he's in there
with Dobby. Oh, God!

11:22.751 --> 11:25.630
Probably. War makes people horny.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.030
Yalta.

11:27.031 --> 11:28.830
Yalta was hardcore.

11:28.831 --> 11:30.990
Stalin and Roosevelt sandwich.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.710
Churchill sat on the side, wanking.

11:33.711 --> 11:35.110
Yeah?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.950
Can we hide with you?
We're not hiding.

11:36.951 --> 11:38.630
We're in a... holding pattern.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.910
'Hmm, the lifeboat is getting
overcrowded.'

11:41.551 --> 11:42.910
Hi.
Hi.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.510
'Yes, it's more the merrier
in the lifeboat.

11:45.511 --> 11:47.870
'You can't have too many people
in a lifeboat.

11:47.871 --> 11:51.870
'That's what they never, ever, ever
fucking say.'

11:52.951 --> 11:56.110
Is this allowed?
Just... run away from the war?

11:56.111 --> 11:58.590
The action of the sane man
through the ages.

11:58.591 --> 12:00.990
They were forming a kill squad
cos of Alice.

12:00.991 --> 12:03.310
Kill squad. That's not a nice squad.

12:03.311 --> 12:05.590
Don't sweat it.
Alice is a doommonger.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.390
Long term, Neil's gonna be
very happy he chucked her.

12:08.391 --> 12:10.510
That was my hunch, cos, y'know...

12:10.511 --> 12:13.230
Well, I'm bound by strict
confidentiality,

12:13.231 --> 12:16.510
but I think it's OK to tell you
because you know him a bit.

12:16.511 --> 12:20.310
Neil likes to get handcuffed
and then pulled off with gloves on.

12:20.311 --> 12:21.430
Does he?

12:21.431 --> 12:23.510
Yeah. This is all confidential,

12:23.511 --> 12:25.990
and I wouldn't be telling you unless
it was...

12:25.991 --> 12:28.070
interesting.
That would be unprofessional.

12:28.071 --> 12:30.550
But she wouldn't wear
the gloves, even at Christmas.

12:30.551 --> 12:31.150
Bloody hell!

12:31.151 --> 12:32.230
Can you keep it a secret?

12:32.231 --> 12:32.870
I don't know.

12:32.871 --> 12:35.870
He sucked a guy off at college and
thinks he might want to do it again.

12:35.871 --> 12:38.670
Wow! OK, and what about
the football coaching thing?

12:38.671 --> 12:41.110
Yeah. 'What was the football
coaching thing?'

12:41.111 --> 12:44.950
'There was something about his job.
Really liked his job or something.'

12:44.951 --> 12:47.470
I really think I've said enough,
to be honest.

12:47.471 --> 12:49.430
Hey, Gaylord!
You gonna bum the lesbo?

12:49.431 --> 12:50.550
What's that?

12:50.551 --> 12:51.190
Lesbo.

12:51.191 --> 12:52.590
Yeah?

12:52.591 --> 12:55.390
Eat this, motherfucker.

12:55.391 --> 12:56.790
Fuck's sake!

12:56.791 --> 12:59.230
And if I was gay, why would I want
to bum her?

12:59.231 --> 13:03.230
That doesn't even make sense.
Taste my logic gun, bitch man.

13:04.871 --> 13:08.870
'God, this is so frightening and
boring, just like a real war,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.590
'cowering in a foxhole for months.

13:10.591 --> 13:13.350
'I could have got this sensation
of anxiety and fear at home

13:13.351 --> 13:17.190
'by drinking three cafetieres of
coffee and then lying under my bed

13:17.191 --> 13:18.590
'and calling my dad after 10pm.

13:18.591 --> 13:22.310
They went this way. Scour the area.

13:22.311 --> 13:25.910
Guys, look, they're onto you.
There are too many of us here.

13:25.911 --> 13:28.470
What about this?

13:28.471 --> 13:30.430
Matches.

13:30.431 --> 13:33.990
Two longies, two shorties.

13:33.991 --> 13:35.070
Pick.

13:35.071 --> 13:35.790
OK.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.910
Short. You're going. Sorry.

13:37.911 --> 13:39.630
Shit!

13:39.631 --> 13:43.350
Mate?

13:43.351 --> 13:44.670
Long. Mark?

13:44.671 --> 13:46.790
'Oh...! One short, one long.'

13:46.791 --> 13:48.350
Short. Congratulations.

13:48.351 --> 13:49.350
But...

13:49.351 --> 13:53.350
Yeah. First short goes, first long
goes. And the last one is long,

13:53.551 --> 13:56.470
so I'm good. Bad luck, guys.

13:56.471 --> 13:57.230
Is that right?

13:57.231 --> 13:58.870
Yeah, course it's right.
Innit, Mark?

13:58.871 --> 14:00.390
'Hmm, bit horrible, but...'

14:00.391 --> 14:02.630
That's right. Sorry.

14:02.631 --> 14:05.310
Hey, we don't make the rules.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.710
Well, you did make the rules.

14:07.711 --> 14:10.510
I think that you might be OK.
'You won't be OK.'

14:10.511 --> 14:12.270
Yeah?

14:12.271 --> 14:14.590
Listen up, Hall and Oates,
you're going for a walk

14:14.591 --> 14:17.190
and you may be some time.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.030
'Fuck, it worked!'

14:19.031 --> 14:21.790
'Maybe I should use the matches
to get Jeremy to move out.'

14:21.791 --> 14:23.870
'Long, he leaves.
Short, he leaves.'

14:25.511 --> 14:26.990
Ow! Fuck!

14:26.991 --> 14:29.990
Jesus. They're painting those poor
bastards like the Forth Bridge.

14:29.991 --> 14:32.550
All right, bunker cleared.
Moving off!

14:32.551 --> 14:34.230
Thank God.

14:34.231 --> 14:36.310
They're lucky they didn't get hit
by the Snitch.

14:36.311 --> 14:36.950
The Snitch?

14:36.951 --> 14:37.910
Golden Snitch.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.550
Apparently,
the Yellows like to mix it up a bit,

14:40.551 --> 14:43.190
chuck a ball bearing in the paint
pot - keep it interesting.

14:43.191 --> 14:45.390
A ball bearing?! But that would...

14:45.391 --> 14:46.710
That'd kill you!

14:46.711 --> 14:48.830
No! No.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.470
I mean, it'd go in ya.

14:50.471 --> 14:51.590
It'd go in you?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.030
Yeah, it'd go in you a bit.

14:53.031 --> 14:55.950
Wouldn't it? From one of those
guns? A fucking ball bearing?!

14:55.951 --> 14:56.590
Oh, God.

14:56.591 --> 15:00.590
Splat an eyeball, take out your
windpipe. Take a nut off like that.

15:02.191 --> 15:03.710
You'll be all right.

15:03.711 --> 15:05.470
Unless you get hit in a sensitive
area.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.670
But I'm covered in sensitive areas!

15:07.671 --> 15:10.790
I can't see a single part of me that
I would nominate

15:10.791 --> 15:14.390
to be smashed with
a high-velocity ball bearing.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.710
Hans, I'm really sorry, but...

15:16.711 --> 15:18.510
I think I need to do a poo.

15:18.511 --> 15:21.110
You're not pooing in the bunker,
Mark.

15:21.111 --> 15:21.750
You had a wee!

15:21.751 --> 15:24.270
Yeah, a little bit of wee,
compared to a great big poo.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.950
You're not pooing in this bunker.

15:25.951 --> 15:27.590
Poo in the bunker, I will shoot you.

15:27.591 --> 15:31.390
'Could keep it in, but then what if
I get into a combat situation

15:31.391 --> 15:32.950
'and my valves go floppy?'

15:32.951 --> 15:36.950
Oh, for God's sake!

15:36.951 --> 15:38.630
'The Charge of the Shit Brigade.'

15:38.631 --> 15:42.630
'Oh...
Force 10 Poo From Navarone?'

15:42.831 --> 15:45.190
'I thought humanity
had evolved beyond this.'

15:45.191 --> 15:48.430
'This is a really fun weekend!'

15:48.431 --> 15:50.070
'Could it be any worse?'

15:50.071 --> 15:53.030
'Maybe, if Dobby and Simon came
round the corner humping

15:53.031 --> 15:55.310
'and then shot me with my pants
down.'

15:55.311 --> 15:57.030
'Started this war as Napoleon,

15:57.031 --> 15:59.990
'but I'm reduced to wiping
my bum with his biography.'

15:59.991 --> 16:02.830
'Although I am able to pick
a section I've already read.'

16:02.831 --> 16:06.790
'Plus, it's not like Napoleon is
wiping his bum with pages of my
biography,

16:06.791 --> 16:10.790
'so I am, to an extent,
maybe winning?'

16:14.751 --> 16:18.750
Simon wants to know if I'll join him
in his bunker for a party.

16:19.711 --> 16:22.190
Yeah, Hitler put the bad vibe
on the bunker party.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.670
Like he did with so much else.

16:23.671 --> 16:25.750
I shouldn't talk to you about this,
should I?

16:25.751 --> 16:28.790
It's cool. I am a professional
life coach, remember.

16:28.791 --> 16:31.510
Everything you say
will be strictly confidential.

16:31.511 --> 16:33.310
What's Mark like to live with?

16:33.311 --> 16:36.390
'Well, I hate living with him,
but I never want it to end.'

16:36.391 --> 16:39.350
'Why is that? Is it like Stockholm
syndrome, where you want to go

16:39.351 --> 16:42.110
'and live in Stockholm
with a dick, or something?'

16:42.111 --> 16:43.350
That is quite a long wait.

16:43.351 --> 16:44.990
Is he a secret paedo or something?

16:44.991 --> 16:46.910
No. Obviously, no.

16:46.911 --> 16:48.150
'She's asking for it.'

16:48.151 --> 16:49.990
'She's begging for a life-coaching.'

16:49.991 --> 16:52.470
How are you feeling
about moving in with him?

16:52.471 --> 16:54.390
Well, you know Mark -
he's brilliant.

16:54.391 --> 16:58.390
Sour and funny and cynical
and anxious and screwed up.

16:58.511 --> 17:00.230
'Keep going.'

17:00.231 --> 17:02.910
But sometimes I wonder,
is he enough fun?

17:02.911 --> 17:04.670
Right. Yeah.

17:04.671 --> 17:05.790
'"Fun" means good at sex.'

17:05.790 --> 17:09.550
'Everyone knows that.
Basic life coaching.'

17:09.550 --> 17:13.470
'Oh, drugs! He'll probably start
hallucinating I'm a Yellow

17:13.471 --> 17:15.109
'or a sexy female hostage.'

17:15.111 --> 17:17.790
I'm going Ewok, mate.
Full-on fuckin' furball.

17:17.790 --> 17:20.270
I've got hairy ears
poking out of me noggin.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.829
Maybe not too much more speed?

17:22.830 --> 17:26.390
They think I'm a drugged-up scumbag.
They're all the same, the Yellows.

17:26.391 --> 17:29.550
Yeah.
The Empire - we're 22-carat Ewok.

17:29.551 --> 17:30.870
Right.

17:30.871 --> 17:33.310
We should get one of 'em in here,
take a knife to him.

17:33.311 --> 17:35.710
You don't mean a real knife.
You mean a... paint knife.

17:35.711 --> 17:39.710
It's a paintbrush, Mark. I'm just
talking Swiss Army. Cut one up.

17:40.231 --> 17:41.550
What d'you say to that?

17:41.551 --> 17:43.830
I say let's definitely not do that.

17:43.831 --> 17:47.830
Forget the knife, just get one of
them down on the floor, yeah?

17:47.991 --> 17:51.990
Strip him. Paint his arsehole from
point-blank range. What d'you say?

17:52.191 --> 17:55.790
I'd say you've moved from attempted
murder to violent sexual assault,

17:55.791 --> 17:57.550
which is probably,

17:57.551 --> 18:01.550
technically, moving in
the, quote, "right direction".

18:01.831 --> 18:05.830
How about we just surrender, make
my boxers into a makeshift white
flag,

18:06.191 --> 18:08.190
march into their bunker,
my boxers on a stick,

18:08.191 --> 18:10.030
and say,
"What the hell's going on here?"

18:10.031 --> 18:13.430
Still living
the boxer-short dream, Mark, eh?

18:13.431 --> 18:15.430
You need to get some ball support

18:15.431 --> 18:19.430
before your nuts start dragging like
iron eggs in a pair of Grayson
Perry's tights.

18:21.071 --> 18:23.510
'Hmm, locked in with
a mad commanding officer.'

18:23.511 --> 18:26.750
'Only problem is, if I shoot him,
he won't actually die.'

18:26.751 --> 18:30.190
Do you think Simon is really getting
it on with Dobs in the bunker,

18:30.191 --> 18:31.870
or is it just me being paranoid?

18:31.871 --> 18:34.150
No, mate, course you're not.

18:34.151 --> 18:37.790
Yellows, fuckin' yellow-bellied.
Yellow fever!

18:37.791 --> 18:39.790
Boning your bird? Classic Yellow.

18:39.791 --> 18:43.790
'Probably not the most reliable
spirit level to test my paranoia
against.'

18:43.831 --> 18:46.870
Seriously, I've had it up to here
with Yellow shit.

18:46.871 --> 18:50.630
If you wanna belt up and bust out,
Mark, I am in.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.310
Well, as Napoleon once said...
'Hmm, what's a goody?'

18:53.311 --> 18:56.670
"Laws which are consistent in theory
often prove chaotic in practice".

18:56.671 --> 18:58.670
Fuck, yeah!

18:58.671 --> 19:00.910
'Oh, God.
He's going to kill someone.'

19:00.911 --> 19:04.910
'With paint. I might have inspired
a paint war crime.'

19:05.271 --> 19:06.830
I think the truth is,

19:06.831 --> 19:10.830
basically,
I've been bored ever since 9/11.

19:10.951 --> 19:12.230
Yeah?

19:12.231 --> 19:15.110
I mean, I was watching the news
with Mark the other day,

19:15.111 --> 19:17.510
and he was, like, all up in my grill
about the euro,

19:17.511 --> 19:21.510
and I was, like, "Ooh, the Italians
might leave the euro, big wow."

19:21.511 --> 19:24.030
It's not exactly planes
smashing into buildings, is it?

19:24.031 --> 19:26.430
Yeah. That was good news.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.870
Not good news, obviously,
but good... news.

19:28.871 --> 19:30.230
It was amazing news.

19:30.231 --> 19:34.230
Y'know, in terms of events and
consequences, it was just huge news.

19:35.511 --> 19:37.870
Maybe I've been bored since 9/11.

19:37.871 --> 19:40.470
They set their standards too high
with 9/11, the news.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.190
They can't top it.

19:42.191 --> 19:43.030
Exactly.

19:43.031 --> 19:44.030
'I love you.'

19:44.031 --> 19:45.830
'Holy fuck!
Where did that come from?'

19:46.671 --> 19:50.670
Simon again. Last year, he was all,
"It's just not working."

19:51.271 --> 19:55.110
Now I'm with Mark, he's all, "Ooh,
I forgot what nice calves you have.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.990
"Let me put my dobbin
in your noggin."

19:56.991 --> 19:58.310
Tch! Right.

19:58.311 --> 20:00.470
'Get your dobbin out of her noggin.'

20:00.471 --> 20:03.790
'There's a queue here - Mark, me,
dead Gerrard, then you

20:03.791 --> 20:05.590
'at the very back of the queue.'

20:05.591 --> 20:06.630
Jez? Are you OK?

20:06.631 --> 20:08.190
Yeah. Yeah.

20:08.191 --> 20:11.030
Yeah. I was just thinking about...

20:11.031 --> 20:14.390
how weird it is that, er, things

20:14.391 --> 20:16.950
and also people, er,

20:16.951 --> 20:20.230
can sometimes be di... different.

20:20.231 --> 20:23.910
Yeah. I'd love to agree,
but you're spouting gibberish.

20:23.911 --> 20:25.390
Come on,

20:25.391 --> 20:28.350
let's rejoin the troops
before we get court-martialled.

20:28.351 --> 20:30.550
'This is bad.
I've done a lot of bad shit,

20:30.551 --> 20:33.950
'but falling in love with her is the
worst - or at least the most recent...

20:33.951 --> 20:37.950
'bad thing I've ever done.'

20:37.951 --> 20:40.870
That Yellow bastard'll be in there
right now, doing your missus.

20:40.871 --> 20:42.430
We need to get in there.

20:42.431 --> 20:44.070
OK. Let's think this through.

20:44.071 --> 20:48.070
How about we outflank and try a
Napoleonic manoeuvre de derriere? Eh?

20:48.991 --> 20:50.870
I'm gonna give them an art lesson.

20:50.871 --> 20:52.390
I'm gonna Jackson Pollock
these motherfuckers.

20:52.391 --> 20:54.110
Yeah, or...

20:54.111 --> 20:57.110
SUPER HAAAANS!

20:57.111 --> 21:01.110
'Right, into the bunker to save Eva
Braun and cock-block the Fuhrer.'

21:02.311 --> 21:04.150
Where's Dobby?
I thought Dobby was in here.

21:04.151 --> 21:07.230
I've been trying to get her to come
in to talk some sense into Neil.

21:07.231 --> 21:08.670
'No humping. Brilliant.'

21:08.671 --> 21:11.470
'So, just got to get her to stay
faithful for another 40 years,

21:11.471 --> 21:15.470
'when we have very little
basic compatibility.'

21:15.711 --> 21:19.350
Yeah, screw Simon. I'll just move in
with Mark and give it a go.

21:19.351 --> 21:22.030
Great. And if it doesn't work out,
just move in with me!

21:23.311 --> 21:26.270
Just joking. Stupid joke about
something that wouldn't happen.

21:26.271 --> 21:28.150
That'd never work.
We're too similar.

21:28.151 --> 21:28.790
I know!

21:28.791 --> 21:30.270
We'd never get out of bed.

21:30.271 --> 21:32.470
Cos we'd be doing it
and doing it and doing it,

21:32.471 --> 21:34.950
and then have a doobie
and then do it, and watch TV,

21:34.951 --> 21:37.190
then maybe we'd have dinner
and just fuck the world,

21:37.191 --> 21:38.550
and that'd be our whole thing.

21:38.551 --> 21:41.390
'Easy, Romeo, lay off the "doing it".

21:41.391 --> 21:42.110
THWACK!

21:42.111 --> 21:43.910
Argh! Oh, I got the Snitch!

21:43.911 --> 21:47.910
I've taken the fucking Snitch
up the jacksie!

21:47.911 --> 21:50.190
This is bullshit, Mark.

21:50.191 --> 21:52.630
I want revenge.

21:52.631 --> 21:54.270
Dobs! You're OK!

21:54.271 --> 21:55.470
Yeah. Of course I am.

21:55.471 --> 21:57.470
It was her. It was her,

21:57.471 --> 21:58.910
the last Yellow,

21:58.911 --> 22:00.230
with the Golden Snitch.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.710
It wasn't me. We're out of the game.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.390
Yeah, this game ain't got
no off-ramp, sister.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.950
No, Hans, too close!

22:05.951 --> 22:06.830
Bullshit.

22:06.831 --> 22:08.150
No! Ow...

22:08.151 --> 22:08.750
Jez!

22:08.751 --> 22:10.630
Fuck!

22:10.631 --> 22:12.710
What the bloody hell?

22:12.711 --> 22:14.550
Hang on... Are you a secret Yellow?

22:14.551 --> 22:16.030
Are you a double agent?

22:16.031 --> 22:18.230
'Yeah, I'm a double agent.
I'm James Bond,

22:18.231 --> 22:21.390
'and I'm gonna get some ointment
rubbed on my swollen scrotum.'

22:21.391 --> 22:23.590
You ruined my life!

22:23.591 --> 22:25.470
I'm about to be hit?

22:25.471 --> 22:26.390
Correct.

22:26.391 --> 22:27.430
Sorry!

22:27.431 --> 22:30.870
'This is Vietnam - drugs,
breakdown in military order...

22:30.871 --> 22:32.270
'all we need now are The Doors.'

22:32.271 --> 22:34.970
'The Doors!
Now I remember another band!'
