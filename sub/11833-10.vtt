WEBVTT

00:03.369 --> 00:04.437
Voluntary?

00:04.470 --> 00:05.772
With good behavior
and time served,

00:05.806 --> 00:07.574
you could be out in seven.
It's a good deal.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.475
Not a chance.
Take the deal,
Eddie.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.778
We are not doing well
in there. They have pictures,

00:11.812 --> 00:13.714
they have the murder weapon,
and we have nothing.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.549
Two witnesses testified
that you told them

00:15.582 --> 00:16.449
you were going to kill
the victim.

00:16.482 --> 00:18.819
It was self-defense.
You said it in there.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.687
You stabbed him
seven times.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.055
Did you take a look
at that jury?

00:22.088 --> 00:23.590
Why the hell should I?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.458
Look at me.
With this deal,

00:25.491 --> 00:27.628
I can lobby for a lower
security facility,

00:27.661 --> 00:29.095
maybe even conjugal visits.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.197
In my opinion,
the D. A.'s offering you

00:31.231 --> 00:32.098
better than you deserve.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.334
Someone's got to get
that bony-assed bitch.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.102
Look, I've about
had it with you.

00:36.136 --> 00:39.105
Good. Then you can get
your not-so-bony-ass self

00:39.139 --> 00:40.140
Eddie.
Out of here.

00:40.173 --> 00:43.510
I ain't taking voluntary.
I paid you 90,000 bucks.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.645
Which is probably
drug money.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.080
You took it,
like you always have.

00:47.113 --> 00:50.483
Now why don't you take 20
of it and go buy a juror?

00:50.517 --> 00:54.154
I don't care.
Just get me off.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.259
( music playing )

01:44.638 --> 01:45.639
What's this I hear you offered

01:45.672 --> 01:47.307
that cokehead manslaughter?

01:47.340 --> 01:48.809
Relax, Richard.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.712
It was first degree, Helen.
Is this the Christmas spirit?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.446
He turned the deal down.

01:53.479 --> 01:54.314
Excuse me?

01:54.347 --> 01:56.416
The cokehead's sticking
to self-defense.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.286
What? That means
he'll have to testify.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.656
No problem. I testify.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.158
Yeah, there is a problem.
Once you take the stand,

02:05.191 --> 02:07.460
they could introduce all
your felonies to impeach you.

02:07.493 --> 02:10.496
Drug felonies. I never killed
anybody before, right, 'Genie?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.866
Well, I've never
killed anybody before either.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.836
You call me 'Genie one more
time, that could change.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.706
Look, just ask me the questions,
and I'll say what happened.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.341
Eddie, are you
coked up now?

02:21.374 --> 02:23.143
I'm in lock-up.
How do I get anything?

02:24.210 --> 02:25.946
Look, you've seen enough
of Helen Gamble to know

02:25.979 --> 02:27.313
she's going
to be aggressive.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.615
Let her come.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.851
Bobby, he's high. We can't
let him take the stand --

02:30.884 --> 02:33.787
Stay out of this, 'Genie.
You're second chair.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.955
Eugene, excuse us
for a second,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.256
would you, please?

02:42.462 --> 02:43.730
You want your 90 grand
back, Eddie?

02:43.764 --> 02:44.731
'Cause I'll write you
a check with interest

02:44.765 --> 02:45.832
right now and walk away.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.535
Business is good,
huh Bobby?

02:48.935 --> 02:51.772
You wouldn't walk away
from my money 10 years ago.

02:51.805 --> 02:56.543
What makes me sick here
is I helped build your firm.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.344
Over 10 years,
I poured a million bucks

02:58.378 --> 02:59.546
in and out of your place,
and you took it.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.247
You took it. You took it,

03:01.281 --> 03:03.249
knowing exactly
where it came from.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.951
Knowing exactly how
I got it. You took it.

03:04.985 --> 03:05.886
I'm not going
to listen to this.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.722
Hey, maybe you didn't
break any laws, Bobby,

03:08.755 --> 03:10.757
but you and I both know
you laundered my money.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.758
I'd give you a big retainer,

03:11.792 --> 03:14.427
you'd give me half back
after the case was over.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.230
You laundered drug money.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.833
Now you judge me.

03:21.401 --> 03:24.337
You stride in here
in your fancy suit.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.340
You moved up,
and now you judge me?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.409
Don't you lump me
into what you are.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.745
I was never what you are.
I'll never be what you are.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.013
I was a lawyer
representing scum...
EDDIE: You defended me.
You fought

03:33.046 --> 03:33.847
for me because
the money was right.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.516
Which I'm obviously
still doing today!

03:35.549 --> 03:36.917
Now you think you're
something too good!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.885
You stabbed a person
seven times.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.555
Eddie, you're a murderer.
That's how I judge you!

03:41.588 --> 03:44.558
Hey, counselor,
it was self-defense.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.692
Step back, Eddie.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.496
Step back.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.840
I had sold him some heroin
three days before.

03:59.873 --> 04:00.941
The victim?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.943
Yes, and then
he shows up at my house,

04:02.976 --> 04:05.045
rambling about how
the stuff wasn't pure.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.647
I could tell
he was wired.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.681
On heroin?

04:07.714 --> 04:09.349
Or something.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.884
Anyway, he starts
going on

04:10.917 --> 04:13.453
about how he's going
to mess me up,

04:13.486 --> 04:15.989
and he came at me.
We get into a struggle,

04:16.022 --> 04:18.959
and suddenly he's got me
by the throat,

04:18.992 --> 04:20.793
and that's when
I reached for my knife.

04:20.827 --> 04:21.995
Where was the knife?

04:22.028 --> 04:24.998
In my pocket.
It was a switchblade.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.901
He had me by the throat.
I wasn't getting any air.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.004
I'm thinking,
"This is it. I'm dying."

04:32.706 --> 04:34.775
And then I got my knife out
and just started stabbing.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.878
How many times did you
stab him with the knife, Eddie?

04:37.911 --> 04:41.682
I didn't know at the time.
They tell me seven.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.849
I just kept stabbing
at the guy

04:42.883 --> 04:43.884
till he fell off
of me.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.688
Eddie, why didn't
you call the police?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.024
Because I'm a drug dealer,
Mr. Donnell. I sell heroin.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.727
I didn't figure the police
to be too sympathetic,

04:53.760 --> 04:56.730
but I acted in self-defense
that night.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.399
I'm no model citizen,
I admit,

04:59.432 --> 05:01.602
but I'm no murderer.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.805
Seven times you stabbed him
before he fell off you?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.106
That's right.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.941
Because he was
strangling you.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.375
Yes.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.577
How much do you weigh,
Mr. Wicks?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.045
Around 175.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.479
Do you know how much
the victim weighed?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.548
No.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.350
Would it surprise you to learn
he weighed 135 pounds,

05:17.383 --> 05:18.852
40 pounds less than you?

05:18.885 --> 05:21.955
When a guy has you by the neck,
size doesn't matter too much.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.724
Doctors find any bruising
around your neck?

05:23.757 --> 05:24.591
No.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.627
Did the victim
owe you money, Mr. Wicks?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.094
This wasn't about that.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.631
Did the victim
owe you money, sir?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.632
Yes.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.633
How much?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.034
Around $60,000.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.402
This debt was incurred
through past drug sales?

05:36.436 --> 05:37.170
Yes.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.872
You've been convicted
three times

05:38.905 --> 05:41.575
for selling
and possessing drugs?

05:41.608 --> 05:44.044
I'm a drug guy. I said it,
but I'm not a killer.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.912
Did you tell Mr. Olson
you'd kill him

05:45.946 --> 05:47.147
if he didn't satisfy
his debt?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.382
I had previously
threatened him, yes,

05:49.415 --> 05:51.752
but this incident here
was self-defense.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.455
You said the victim
just showed up at your house.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.558
Did you call him
shortly before he came?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.960
Yes, to discuss
his outstanding account.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.695
You didn't invite him over
so you could kill him?

06:01.728 --> 06:02.829
Objection.
Objection.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.130
Sustained.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.033
Ever stab anybody else
with a switchblade, Mr. Wicks?

06:07.067 --> 06:10.637
Drug trafficking is
a tough trade, Ms. Gamble.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.574
Sometimes I've had
to use my knife,

06:13.607 --> 06:16.677
but this instance here
was self-defense.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.644
That's a yes.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.681
You have used your knife
to stab people before.

06:21.848 --> 06:22.849
Yes.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.691
Mistrial? Because of
the expression on my face?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.560
You all but told the jury
not to believe him.
I did no such thing.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.061
You were so obviously
rejecting his testimony.

06:35.095 --> 06:35.996
Forget it.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.598
Your honor.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.866
First of all,
I was not shooting any looks.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.468
Second, I wouldn't be conveying
that kind of a look anyway

06:42.503 --> 06:45.438
because I don't necessarily
believe that your little

06:45.471 --> 06:49.042
scum-sucking, lying,
murdering client is guilty.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.044
He could've just been
temporarily insane

06:51.077 --> 06:52.445
and under the delusion

06:52.478 --> 06:53.814
that he was stabbing
his own mother.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.881
You think that's funny?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.751
Who do you think
you're kidding?

06:57.784 --> 06:59.052
You're in here
looking for a mistrial

06:59.085 --> 07:00.787
because you know
just like I know

07:00.821 --> 07:02.856
what the verdict
is going to be.

07:02.889 --> 07:03.824
Let me tell you,
counsel.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.693
I don't play those games.
And just for asking,

07:06.727 --> 07:08.595
I'm hitting you
with a $500 fine.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.696
Appealed.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.966
So noted. Mistrial.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.006
He actually moved
for a mistrial?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.742
You know Bobby.
If things are desperate,

07:21.775 --> 07:23.209
he'll try anything.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.878
I suppose if I ever
killed anybody,

07:24.911 --> 07:26.112
he'd be the guy I'd call.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.150
Helen, I, uh, I notice you got
a little mistletoe hanging.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.585
Where?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.558
Oh, God. Maintenance
must have done that.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.859
Even so...

07:38.892 --> 07:40.126
Don't harass me,
Richard.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.062
You liked my kiss.
You said so.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.063
I said it was nice.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.931
That doesn't mean
it couldn't use a little work.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.633
( sighs )

07:46.667 --> 07:48.535
Oh, now you're hurt.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.504
What was wrong with it?

07:50.537 --> 07:51.538
It was lovely.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.640
No, no,
don't patronize me, Helen.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.576
Just tell me.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.011
( sighs )
Okay, well,

07:58.044 --> 08:00.747
your little tongue
was shooting around everywhere

08:00.781 --> 08:03.049
like a lizard
trying to catch a fly.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.651
That's a technique.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.588
Technique? Richard,
it was darting in and out.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.523
All right, look.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.898
That's what
a good kiss is like.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.000
The tongue should know
what it's doing.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.109
He got to you,
didn't he?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.177
Well, he had a point.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.715
I half-built this place
doing drug cases.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.784
Should I give you the speech
you always give me?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.184
Drug cases
subsidize --

08:39.219 --> 08:41.587
No, I don't need
the speech.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.890
It went a little
beyond that with Eddie.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.192
What do you mean?

08:46.226 --> 08:49.630
Well, we were friends.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.797
You know,
I'd hang out with him

08:50.831 --> 08:52.566
after the case was over.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.701
I'd suppress the evidence,
he'd throw a little party,

08:54.735 --> 08:56.703
and I'd celebrate with him.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.638
You know,
he was the client

08:57.671 --> 09:00.040
and a good businessman
caters to the client.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.008
I think I always
led him to believe

09:03.009 --> 09:04.110
that I really liked him.

09:04.911 --> 09:05.879
Did you?

09:05.912 --> 09:07.280
Maybe I did.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.784
I think when someone's
buttering your bread,

09:10.817 --> 09:11.618
you want to like him.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.723
Did he launder money
through this place?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.327
Probably.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.031
It was never said,
but, you know,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.233
he'd give me
a $25,000 cash retainer

09:27.267 --> 09:28.001
for a 2-day trial,

09:28.034 --> 09:30.937
and I'd pay him back
the unused.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.841
Yeah, it was probably
the equivalent of laundering.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.982
I guess I was dirty, too,
Lindsay,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.283
and that's why
he can't bear

09:43.316 --> 09:45.786
me passing judgment
on him today.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.388
Bobby, you were
in a legitimate business.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.624
He wasn't. He sees all
that you've accomplished

09:50.657 --> 09:51.992
and how he stayed
in the same place,

09:52.025 --> 09:52.959
and he's angry.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.196
No, he's angry because
when I needed his money,

09:56.229 --> 09:57.598
I liked him.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.101
And now that I don't,

10:02.402 --> 10:03.604
I don't.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.272
Well...

10:07.708 --> 10:09.743
it's all about over,
anyway.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.844
He'll get murder two
at best.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.146
He's looking
at a life sentence.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.115
Consider him
lost business.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.951
I haven't lost yet.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.363
Are you saying
we got no shot?

10:30.396 --> 10:32.365
I'm saying
it's a long shot.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.234
We can argue the elements,
but in my opinion,

10:34.267 --> 10:35.836
the jury has already
made up its mind.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.970
I paid you enough money --

10:37.003 --> 10:40.040
Will you stop with the money?
You can't buy acquittals.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.074
How about you, 'Genie?

10:41.107 --> 10:43.009
Would you like me
to take your head off?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.445
What, you think if
a lawyer attacks his client,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.280
it buys him a mistrial
or something?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.248
Would it?

10:48.281 --> 10:50.183
Look Eddie, manslaughter is
our best bet --

10:50.216 --> 10:51.217
I ain't taking
manslaughter!

10:51.251 --> 10:52.352
You want murder two
or murder one?

10:52.385 --> 10:53.119
'cause that's what
you're going to get.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.722
You want a piece
of me, Eddie, huh?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.456
You haven't
got your knife now,

10:56.489 --> 10:57.658
and I weigh
more than a buck 40.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.193
I wouldn't need my knife.
I could pay you to play dead.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.328
All right.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.401
Go in there
and argue the elements.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.138
Just argue the elements.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.950
It's absolutely impossible.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.151
Are you sure, doctor?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.087
For the victim
to continue strangling

11:27.120 --> 11:28.321
with seven stab wounds?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.490
The loss of blood alone
would have dropped him,

11:30.524 --> 11:32.492
plus the knife
hit major arteries

11:32.526 --> 11:35.095
in both the heart
and neck.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.097
This was not
self-defense.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.464
Objection.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.467
Sustained. Just give us
the medicals, doctor.

11:41.502 --> 11:44.771
Dr. Foster, were you able
to make a determination

11:44.805 --> 11:46.272
as to the order
of the wounds?

11:46.306 --> 11:49.175
Well, first,
the wounds on the hands

11:49.209 --> 11:50.443
looked to be
defensive in nature,

11:50.476 --> 11:52.278
as if he had
his palms up to block.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.180
The idea that his hands
were on the defendant's neck

11:54.214 --> 11:56.216
at the time
he received them --

11:56.249 --> 11:58.218
also impossible.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.786
Is he testifying
to the order here?

11:59.820 --> 12:00.987
I'm about to, counsel.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.256
Then please do so, doctor.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.259
The hands came first,

12:06.292 --> 12:08.762
the jugular vein in the neck
was then severed,

12:08.795 --> 12:11.164
and while the victim
was clutching his neck,

12:11.197 --> 12:14.334
he was then stabbed
in the arm, then the heart.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.237
The wound to the atrium
in the heart was the fatal one.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.440
Now, it's your medical opinion
that the victim's hands

12:20.473 --> 12:22.442
were not
on the defendant's neck

12:22.475 --> 12:25.812
at the time he received
the fatal wound to the heart?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.981
That is
my medical opinion, yes.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.853
Aah! ( gasping )

12:32.886 --> 12:33.920
Stop that man!

12:33.954 --> 12:36.122
BOBBY: Eddie, no!

12:36.156 --> 12:37.558
Eddie!
JUDGE SWACKHEIM: Bailiff!

12:37.591 --> 12:39.492
Stop that man!

12:39.526 --> 12:41.127
Hey, hey!

12:41.161 --> 12:42.395
Security, come in here!

12:42.428 --> 12:44.831
Get that man
out of my court!

12:44.865 --> 12:47.300
( screaming )

12:47.333 --> 12:48.802
Cuff him!

12:50.504 --> 12:51.471
You okay?

12:51.505 --> 12:53.507
Yeah, and you? Helen?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.576
Helen?

12:55.609 --> 12:57.110
She's still breathing.
Get an ambulance!

12:57.143 --> 12:58.945
( Eddie groaning )

12:58.979 --> 13:00.413
Get an ambulance!

13:02.248 --> 13:04.250
Just lie still,
Helen.
I'm okay.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.252
Lie still.
I can get up.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.554
Stay back, sir.
Let me through.

13:07.588 --> 13:08.454
She's my girlfriend.
Let me through.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.025
I'm not your girlfriend.
One date, Richard.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.994
Helen.
Bobby, I'm okay!

13:14.027 --> 13:15.261
You're going to the hospital
to get checked out.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.297
I'm not his girlfriend.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.101
Is she okay?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.102
From what I gather.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.103
What hospital?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.437
Mass general.
I'm going.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.506
Wait. She's being
released already.

13:25.539 --> 13:26.306
It was just a concussion.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.609
He just mugged her
in the courtroom?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.043
That's what Bobby said.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.145
Now what happens?

13:32.178 --> 13:33.413
You got to be kidding.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.148
Do I look like
I'm kidding?

13:35.181 --> 13:37.383
There's no way this trial could
possibly go on after that.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.185
You think I'm going
to reward this bastard

13:39.219 --> 13:41.522
with a mistrial
after he jumps the D. A.?

13:41.555 --> 13:43.557
That's exactly why
he did it. He knew he --

13:43.590 --> 13:44.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.326
The jury is not going
to be impartial.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
I will instruct the jury
to disregard

13:48.394 --> 13:50.564
That's crazy.
the assault
on the D. A.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.198
Disregard? We don't even
have a district attorney

13:52.232 --> 13:53.199
to prosecute right now.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.467
We'll get a new one.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.169
Oh, you can't be serious.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.938
Come on, come on.
Listen to me, both of you.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.040
The commonwealth
has already spent $100,000

14:00.073 --> 14:02.375
on this piece of dirt.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.011
Now, I'm not about
to start all over again

14:05.045 --> 14:06.913
and waste
the taxpayers' money,

14:06.947 --> 14:09.650
especially when I think that
the motive for this attack

14:09.683 --> 14:11.317
was to get a mistrial.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.486
Any conviction will just
get thrown out on appeal.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.488
Maybe it will,
maybe it won't,

14:15.522 --> 14:17.223
but with a conviction,

14:17.257 --> 14:20.126
the state will have something
to bargain with, won't they?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.928
Maybe this thing
will plead out,

14:21.962 --> 14:24.330
which it should have done
to begin with,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.600
except that your coked-up,
murdering scumball's brain

14:26.633 --> 14:29.035
was too scrambled to see
the wisdom of that.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.404
so, you expect just
to continue on

14:31.437 --> 14:33.173
like nothing happened?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.975
I will give
an instruction --

14:35.008 --> 14:36.442
No judge in his right mind
would let this continue.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.911
Too bad. You got me.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.013
I won't do it.
I want off.
Denied.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.515
Helen Gamble
is a friend of mine,

14:41.548 --> 14:42.683
and I won't continue
defending the man --

14:42.716 --> 14:44.350
Yes, you will.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
I'll throw it away.
Then I'll put you away.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.054
Do it.
I will do it.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.690
I'm not going to defend
the man who did this!

14:49.723 --> 14:52.192
You will defend him, or I'll
put you in lockup right now!

14:52.225 --> 14:53.694
What kind of judge
are you?

14:53.727 --> 14:57.097
The best kind --
old, crazy, and fed up!

14:57.130 --> 14:59.132
This trial goes on!

15:03.303 --> 15:05.171
It's going forward?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.940
I'll take over.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.543
How can he not call a mistrial?
The guy attacked me.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.545
It's Swackheim. Look,
just get me the file --

15:11.578 --> 15:14.047
Helen.
I can do it, Richard.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.481
It was a concussion.
I took an Advil.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.050
Well, if you have
headaches --

15:17.083 --> 15:20.186
I'm not going to let
that dirtbag scare me off.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.188
Well, I'm sitting
second chair.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.424
You're at least
getting backup.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.226
Richard?

15:27.694 --> 15:29.663
What was that
"she's my girlfriend" stuff?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.598
Do we need to have
a conversation?

15:31.632 --> 15:33.567
They wouldn't
let me through.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.469
I just wanted
to get through.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.304
But don't worry.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.174
You certainly set
the record quite straight.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.109
I'm sorry the idea's
so, offensive to you.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.546
I hurt your feelings.

15:45.579 --> 15:48.248
I asked for it.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.719
( door slams )

15:57.190 --> 15:58.725
If you think
you can't separate

15:58.759 --> 16:03.063
what happened in this room
from the case we're trying,

16:03.096 --> 16:06.332
just say so.
I'll take you off.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.168
But if you continue on
as jurors,

16:08.201 --> 16:12.205
you damn well better consider
the two events separate.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.508
One's got nothing
to do with the other,

16:14.541 --> 16:17.143
and if you let his attack
on the district attorney

16:17.177 --> 16:20.647
color your deliberations
on the murder charge,

16:20.681 --> 16:23.617
you're mentally deficient
thugs.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.185
You get that?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.621
You took an oath
to listen to the evidence

16:27.654 --> 16:30.290
and to rule on it.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.758
And if any of you
go back there

16:31.792 --> 16:33.727
and consider anything

16:33.760 --> 16:36.597
except the evidence
properly admitted

16:36.630 --> 16:40.534
and I find out about it...

16:40.567 --> 16:42.903
I'll hold you in contempt.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.474
What do we have
on the medical examiner?

16:48.509 --> 16:49.810
Here's what
we have so far.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.211
He had a reputation
in Los Angeles

16:51.244 --> 16:52.546
for being sloppy.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.114
I found three prosecutors
who blame him

16:54.147 --> 16:55.649
for losing convictions,

16:55.682 --> 16:57.350
although they say he makes
for a very good witness,

16:57.383 --> 16:58.284
which I guess
you already know.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.654
Is that why he got fired --
for sloppiness?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.723
Oh, no, no, no.
You are going to love this.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.125
He was surprised one night
in his examining room

17:05.157 --> 17:06.727
while he was
sexually gratifying himself.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.095
Excuse me?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.430
Alone with a dead body.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.632
That's why he got fired?

17:11.665 --> 17:13.366
Not the reason given,

17:13.398 --> 17:15.569
but I'm told it was
an election year for the D. A.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.403
And that was
the factor.
What else?

17:17.436 --> 17:18.137
That's all so far.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.207
He supposedly had
a brief affair

17:21.241 --> 17:22.509
with another
medical examiner in L. A.,

17:22.542 --> 17:24.243
but other than that,
he's clean.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.579
Okay, Eugene, you take him
on the medicals.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.181
I'll do the other.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.816
Well, it sounds like we're
crossing the line a little.

17:29.850 --> 17:31.685
Hey, it's murder.
It's also personal.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.654
You and Swackheim --
it's personal.

17:33.687 --> 17:36.623
He thinks he can
push us around. We'll see.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.503
( lift bell rings )

17:51.137 --> 17:52.438
You ready?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.708
Ready as I'll get.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.178
Nothing to lose
in there, Eugene.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.313
Let's just go for it.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.715
Nothing to lose.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.717
Except the usual --
our reputations.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.719
That judge has turned
this thing

18:05.752 --> 18:07.721
into a free-for-all.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.322
Let's just swing wild.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.492
Like I said, I'm ready.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.228
EUGENE: Dr. Foster,
I call your attention

18:15.261 --> 18:17.397
to the homicide prosecution
of Lawrence Shields

18:17.430 --> 18:19.666
two years ago
in Los Angeles.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.503
You were the M.E. involved
in that prosecution?

18:22.536 --> 18:23.804
Yes.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.806
Mr. Shields was convicted
in large part

18:25.839 --> 18:28.441
due to your testimony.
Yes.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.476
And Mr. Shields' conviction
was subsequently overturned

18:30.511 --> 18:33.246
because the cause of death
attested to by you

18:33.279 --> 18:34.380
turned out to be incorrect.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.649
Objection.
What's that got --

18:35.682 --> 18:38.284
Offered to impeach. This doctor
has been wrong

18:38.318 --> 18:39.520
many times before,
botching prosecutions --

18:39.553 --> 18:41.421
Objection.
Sustained.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.289
This man was fired
in Los Angeles

18:43.323 --> 18:44.457
because he repeatedly
screwed up investigation.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.292
BOTH: Objection.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.861
I know they'd like
to keep it quiet, your honor,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.730
BOTH: Objection.
But you should be
concerned.

18:49.763 --> 18:50.931
Mr. Young, that's enough.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.466
We will not be
going through other cases.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.669
I'm sure you've made mistakes
before, as well.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.271
None of mine
sent a man to jail.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.841
Are you suggesting your client
did not stab the man, counsel?

19:00.874 --> 19:03.443
I'm suggesting it didn't
happen like you said it did.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.479
I'm suggesting all those
absolutes you threw out

19:06.513 --> 19:07.814
may not be
quite so absolute.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.550
Argumentative.
Sustained.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.385
Doctor, you testified
the victim was stabbed

19:12.418 --> 19:13.620
in the jugular vein,
did you not?

19:13.654 --> 19:14.688
I did.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.622
But in your initial report,
you said

19:15.656 --> 19:18.458
the victim was stabbed
in the carotid artery.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
This was never
officially listed.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.196
I first thought the carotid,
but it was the jugular.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.899
And if a person
were strangling somebody,

19:25.932 --> 19:27.668
and he was stabbed
in the jugular,

19:27.701 --> 19:30.937
it would be an absolute
medical impossibility

19:30.971 --> 19:32.338
for him to keep squeezing.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.740
Is that
your medical testimony?

19:33.774 --> 19:36.610
It would be
extremely unlikely.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.444
Doctor, I asked you
if it would be impossible.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.481
I suppose it's not
an impossibility.

19:41.515 --> 19:42.749
Well, those were
your words yesterday --

19:42.783 --> 19:45.485
"absolute impossibility."

19:45.519 --> 19:46.352
Did you overstate it?

19:46.386 --> 19:47.621
The odds of somebody --

19:47.654 --> 19:48.889
Did you overstate it?

19:48.922 --> 19:51.224
I shouldn't have said,
"absolute impossibility."

19:51.257 --> 19:52.893
You overstated it.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.494
Yes.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.598
so, to restate it,
it would be possible

19:57.631 --> 19:59.332
for the victim
to be strangling,

19:59.365 --> 20:01.334
to receive a wound
to the throat,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.937
and yet be able
to continue strangling.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.506
Not for very long.

20:05.539 --> 20:06.607
Seconds.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.008
Yes, seconds.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.645
And, doctor, what about
the wounds on the hands?

20:11.678 --> 20:14.480
Is it possible that they
were sustained by Mr. Wicks

20:14.515 --> 20:16.817
sticking the knife
under the victim's hands,

20:16.850 --> 20:18.552
trying to pry them
off his neck?

20:18.585 --> 20:19.920
Again, likelihoods --

20:19.953 --> 20:21.522
I'm not talking
likelihoods, doctor.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.023
I'm talking possibilities.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.891
Anything's possible,
counsel, but I don't --

20:24.925 --> 20:26.426
How long did you examine
the hands?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.929
I don't really remember.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.631
Well, in the medical report,

20:30.664 --> 20:32.799
you make no analysis
of the hand wounds.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.901
Well, they weren't
the fatal wounds.

20:34.935 --> 20:39.439
Ah, doctor, you look
at arterial spurt patterns

20:39.472 --> 20:42.308
to help determine the order
of wounds, do you not?

20:42.342 --> 20:43.544
That's correct.

20:43.577 --> 20:44.511
Did you look at the spurt
patterns in this case?

20:44.545 --> 20:46.547
Yes, I did. I looked
at pictures of the floors

20:46.580 --> 20:48.014
and the wall,
as well as photos of --

20:48.048 --> 20:50.584
Pictures? You didn't go
to the scene?

20:50.617 --> 20:51.918
No, I did not.

20:51.952 --> 20:54.688
Well, doesn't the M.E. go to
the scene of the crime?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.923
Typically, yes.
On this case, I did not.

20:56.957 --> 20:57.958
Well, why's that?

20:57.991 --> 21:01.595
Well, this case wasn't
much of a mystery, counsel,

21:01.628 --> 21:03.930
Mr. Wicks admitting
to stabbing the guy --

21:03.964 --> 21:04.965
Doctor, you were fired
from your position

21:04.998 --> 21:06.833
as medical examiner
in Los Angeles.

21:06.867 --> 21:07.968
Objection.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.603
Goes to this man's pattern
of sloppy investigative work.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.704
HELEN: Move to strike.

21:10.737 --> 21:14.440
Sustained. He's not the one
on trial here, Mr. Young.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.577
This man's testimony,
and his testimony alone,

21:16.610 --> 21:18.044
is the only evidence
to contradict

21:18.078 --> 21:19.880
Mr. Wicks' eyewitness
account of what happened.

21:19.913 --> 21:21.548
His testimony is based
on his examination,

21:21.582 --> 21:23.083
and any evidence

21:23.116 --> 21:25.586
of his ineffective,
sloppy work history

21:25.619 --> 21:26.520
certainly speaks to that.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.421
Objection!
Move to strike
the whole speech.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.724
Sustained. Mr. Young,
knock it off.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.092
Your honor, I'm just
getting started.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.493
Oh, no, you're not.

21:33.527 --> 21:34.928
You'll stick
to the relevant facts,

21:34.961 --> 21:36.429
or I'll shut you down.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.099
Someone should shut you down,
you fat piece of crap!

21:39.132 --> 21:40.601
Why don't you come
running right up here

21:40.634 --> 21:42.435
and attack me,
you scumball?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.605
That's it. How can you
let this trial go on?

21:44.638 --> 21:47.741
Why don't you and judge Judy
go off and mate?
...I'll throw you in jail.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.443
...more inappropriate
I've had enough
of you, your client.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.845
To be a judge
than you already are!

21:51.878 --> 21:53.680
Get in my chambers!

21:55.115 --> 21:56.349
You're a joke.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.884
You're a miserable,
jaded joke

21:57.918 --> 22:00.020
who doesn't care about
the integrity of that room.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.722
And you do.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.724
It is an outrage to let
this trial continue.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.860
It's an outrage to let
defendants manufacture mistrials

22:06.893 --> 22:08.394
when they don't like
the way things are going,

22:08.428 --> 22:10.030
which is exactly
what we have here.

22:10.063 --> 22:12.498
He mugged her
to stop the trial,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.035
and he just called me --
what did he call me?

22:15.068 --> 22:17.003
"A fat piece of crap."

22:17.037 --> 22:19.005
Again, to get a mistrial.

22:19.039 --> 22:20.674
Well, he does so
at his own peril,

22:20.707 --> 22:23.143
and you should have
advised him accordingly.

22:23.176 --> 22:26.079
The trial goes on.
He can call me fat.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.848
He can assault
anybody he chooses,

22:27.881 --> 22:29.650
but the trial goes on.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.918
Then let it go on!

22:31.952 --> 22:35.421
Let us cross-examine the M. E.
without you shutting us down.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.089
Fine!

22:36.122 --> 22:37.791
Fine.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.930
Doctor, do you have
any psychological problems

22:43.964 --> 22:45.532
that the court
should know about?

22:45.566 --> 22:47.534
No, I do not.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.670
Do you have any perversions
that compromise your work?

22:49.703 --> 22:50.971
No.

22:51.004 --> 22:52.973
I imagine you often
have to examine

22:53.006 --> 22:54.775
murder victims that have
also been raped?

22:54.808 --> 22:56.042
Certainly.

22:56.076 --> 22:58.444
Check the victim for semen,
that sort of thing.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.946
Of course.

22:59.980 --> 23:03.116
Ever find
your own semen?

23:06.119 --> 23:07.053
I asked you a question.

23:07.087 --> 23:08.522
I heard the question,
counsel.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.123
I'm offended by it.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.858
One of the reasons
you were fired

23:11.892 --> 23:13.426
from your job
in Los Angeles --

23:13.459 --> 23:15.662
objection! The court has
already ruled --

23:15.696 --> 23:17.197
can't the court fake it
and offer the illusion of
a fair trial?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.199
I object to that.
so, do I.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.167
This is the man who stands
to put my client away.

23:21.201 --> 23:22.536
Do I get to
question him or not?

23:22.569 --> 23:24.838
I'll give you
a short leash.

23:24.871 --> 23:25.772
I don't want
a short leash, judge.

23:25.806 --> 23:28.742
I demand the right
to question this witness.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.577
A defendant in a criminal trial
has the right

23:30.611 --> 23:32.679
to confront his accuser,
and I would like to exercise

23:32.713 --> 23:34.981
my client's right
and confront this witness.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.983
( sighs ) Go ahead.

23:37.017 --> 23:40.120
Dr. Foster, one of the reasons
for your discharge --

23:40.153 --> 23:41.822
an employee walked
into the examining room

23:41.855 --> 23:44.958
to discover you gratifying
yourself over a corpse.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.861
No, it did not happen.
That did not happen.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.129
It didn't happen?
No.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.864
Shall I remind you
that you're under oath?

23:50.897 --> 23:52.866
I wasn't on
or over a corpse.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.035
I was -- It happened
in the privacy of that room.

23:55.068 --> 23:57.738
A corpse was
in the room, but I --

23:57.771 --> 23:59.139
Was there some concern in
the district attorney's office

23:59.172 --> 24:01.675
that you were being
sexually aroused by dead bodies?

24:01.708 --> 24:05.478
No, that was a lie.
It was a lie!

24:05.512 --> 24:09.883
I'm sorry, sir, but I have
to ask the question.

24:09.916 --> 24:13.119
Have you ever had sex
with a cadaver?

24:13.153 --> 24:16.156
No, I have not.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.859
And if I were to proffer
witnesses who claimed

24:18.892 --> 24:20.160
you had sex with cadavers,
they would be liars?

24:20.193 --> 24:21.494
Yes, they would.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.763
You are telling the truth.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.931
Yes, I am, counsel. Is this what
it's come to?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.700
Medical examiners
get crucified?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.134
All right, doctor.

24:28.168 --> 24:29.736
Where the hell are you?
JUDGE: Doctor!

24:29.770 --> 24:30.737
You don't object
to questions

24:30.771 --> 24:32.906
like that?
Where the hell are you?

24:32.939 --> 24:35.542
Doctor, that's enough!

24:39.045 --> 24:40.747
Have you anything else,
counsel?

24:40.781 --> 24:42.683
Have you ever had
extramarital affairs?

24:42.716 --> 24:44.050
Objection --
character evidence.

24:44.084 --> 24:46.019
By taking the stand,
this man puts his reputation

24:46.052 --> 24:48.922
for truthfulness in issue.

24:48.955 --> 24:53.960
Have you ever lied
to your wife, sir?

24:55.128 --> 24:57.230
All right, settle down.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.098
I won't settle down.
That was obscene.

24:58.131 --> 24:59.199
Dr. Foster.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.834
What the hell
has this come to?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.536
I was just sacrificed
up there.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.937
It has nothing to do
with this case.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.906
I'm a good M.E.
This is disgusting.

25:05.939 --> 25:08.174
It's disgusting. Why would
anybody ever testify

25:08.208 --> 25:09.910
if they can --
This is disgusting!

25:09.943 --> 25:11.545
Unfortunately,
personal lives

25:11.578 --> 25:13.680
are becoming
more and more fair game.

25:13.714 --> 25:15.949
Then why would any witness
in his right mind

25:15.982 --> 25:17.718
ever come forward
or do my job?

25:17.751 --> 25:19.285
Well, if he chooses
to do your job,

25:19.319 --> 25:20.186
he should certainly
think twice

25:20.220 --> 25:22.222
about taming his shrew
with a corpse handy.

25:22.255 --> 25:23.824
Oh, you think
that's funny?

25:23.857 --> 25:26.560
It's not funny, but we might
need to explain.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.961
It happened in the privacy
of my office.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.796
Again, having
a cadaver nearby --

25:29.830 --> 25:31.231
Shut up!

25:31.264 --> 25:33.133
I say we don't rehabilitate.
There's no point.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.300
Let's go to closings.

25:34.334 --> 25:37.003
I don't think they really
shook you on anything relevant.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.839
Oh, you don't think they shook
me, Ms. Gamble? I resign.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.975
I don't ever want to be
a player in this system.
You can't resign now.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.577
You can't resign now.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.945
At least wait
till after the trial.

25:44.978 --> 25:47.247
I was raped in there.
I was humiliated.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.851
I was -- Hail, hail
to our great justice system.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.153
Oh, great.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.123
Well, we better work
on the closing.

26:12.272 --> 26:15.075
JUDGE SWACKHEIM:
Miss Gamble.

26:15.108 --> 26:18.979
You know, ever since
the O. J. Simpson trial,

26:19.012 --> 26:21.381
I've had a hard time
defending this process

26:21.414 --> 26:23.817
to non-lawyers.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.252
The way I try
to explain it is that

26:26.286 --> 26:29.055
that was just
an aberrant runaway proceeding

26:29.089 --> 26:32.392
with renegade,
unscrupulous lawyers,

26:32.425 --> 26:35.962
a judge who couldn't
control his room,

26:35.996 --> 26:37.397
combined with total

26:37.430 --> 26:40.400
and utter disregard
for integrity.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.736
And I promised
my friends that

26:42.769 --> 26:45.271
that is just not
the way it is.

26:45.305 --> 26:49.242
But every once in a while
you get a case

26:49.275 --> 26:52.713
that is every bit as disgusting
as the televised debacle

26:52.746 --> 26:54.981
would have the public believe.

26:55.015 --> 26:58.118
We certainly witnessed it
here, didn't we?

26:58.151 --> 27:00.086
The defendant
physically attacked me,

27:00.120 --> 27:02.088
the judge
went off his medication,

27:02.122 --> 27:05.726
and the defense lawyers
were blatantly despicable.

27:05.759 --> 27:06.760
Objection.
Objection.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.894
Sustained.

27:07.928 --> 27:10.731
One thing
the judge did right, however,

27:10.764 --> 27:14.267
was to forcefully remind you
that this case

27:14.300 --> 27:16.903
is only about evidence.

27:16.937 --> 27:19.005
It has nothing to do

27:19.039 --> 27:22.843
with whether a medical examiner
sexually gratified himself,

27:22.876 --> 27:24.745
it has nothing to do

27:24.778 --> 27:27.180
with cases that took place
in Los Angeles,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.750
or whether somebody
cheated on his wife.

27:29.783 --> 27:32.285
The defense would love
to have you focus on that,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.855
but this case is about
who killed Philip Olson,

27:34.888 --> 27:36.957
and we know who did.

27:36.990 --> 27:41.194
The defendant admitted
he stabbed the man seven times.

27:41.227 --> 27:46.266
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

27:46.299 --> 27:48.935
He stabbed the man seven times
with a knife.

27:48.969 --> 27:51.337
That is not in dispute,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:51.371 --> 27:53.473
It's uncontested,

27:53.507 --> 27:57.944
but since a conviction means
an automatic life sentence,

27:57.978 --> 28:01.414
defendants often
roll the dice,

28:01.447 --> 28:04.818
and why shouldn't they?
What do they have to lose?

28:04.851 --> 28:06.186
Might as well
make something up.

28:06.219 --> 28:08.021
There's no reward
for telling the truth.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.123
The life sentence
is automatic.

28:11.792 --> 28:16.229
In this case, the fabrication
is self-defense.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.800
Self-defense.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.269
He stabbed the man
seven times,

28:23.303 --> 28:25.071
including once
in the heart

28:25.105 --> 28:27.908
and once in the throat.

28:27.941 --> 28:29.943
Self-defense.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.045
No bruising
on the defendant's neck,

28:32.078 --> 28:36.482
which an attempted strangulation
most certainly would have left.

28:36.517 --> 28:38.919
He's threatened to kill
the victim before.

28:38.952 --> 28:42.989
He's a convicted drug dealer
who has stabbed people before,

28:43.023 --> 28:46.459
but, hey, self-defense.

28:46.492 --> 28:50.764
Even they know how ridiculous
that theory sounds.

28:50.797 --> 28:54.835
That's why Mr. Wicks decided
to go for a mistrial.

28:54.868 --> 28:57.838
Mug the D. A., have the lawyers
jumping up and down,

28:57.871 --> 29:00.541
turn the whole proceeding
into a giant circus,

29:00.574 --> 29:04.210
and the judge might put a stop
to the whole thing.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.547
At a minimum,
he guarantees himself

29:06.580 --> 29:10.116
a new trial on appeal.

29:10.150 --> 29:15.388
And, hey, if he happens
to be so lucky

29:15.421 --> 29:20.026
as to get
that one gullible juror,

29:20.060 --> 29:22.863
who knows?

29:22.896 --> 29:25.832
And that's
today's judicial system,

29:25.866 --> 29:27.834
ladies and gentlemen.

29:27.868 --> 29:30.236
Words like "justice"
and "honor" and "respect" --

29:30.270 --> 29:31.838
they don't apply.

29:31.872 --> 29:32.806
Lawyers don't get hired today

29:32.839 --> 29:35.008
because they're dignified
or well thought of.

29:35.041 --> 29:39.145
It's winning and losing,
like every business.

29:39.179 --> 29:42.583
It comes down
to winning and losing,

29:42.616 --> 29:46.219
and I'm ashamed
to be a part of it.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.989
I'm embarrassed
to be a practitioner

29:49.022 --> 29:51.291
of what trial law
has become,

29:51.324 --> 29:53.594
which is a joke.

29:53.627 --> 29:57.564
Criminal trials
are a joke.

29:57.598 --> 30:00.166
Maybe one day
I'll go on to teach,

30:00.200 --> 30:02.168
and I'll say that.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.204
Some student
will raise his hand

30:04.237 --> 30:06.607
and ask me
to give an example.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.341
I'll say, "Sure.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.344
"Once I had a case
where the defendant

30:11.377 --> 30:15.348
"stabbed an unarmed man
seven times,

30:15.381 --> 30:20.086
"then walked into court
claiming self-defense.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.222
It's all a joke."

30:34.234 --> 30:37.237
It's a joke we've gone
this far, isn't it?

30:37.270 --> 30:40.106
Like Ms. Gamble says,

30:40.140 --> 30:42.242
seven times he stabbed him.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.644
That tells the story.

30:43.677 --> 30:46.212
It's a joke we've wasted
all your time,

30:46.246 --> 30:49.315
the judge's time,

30:49.349 --> 30:50.651
over $100,000
of the taxpayers' money.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.920
That's a joke.
On the easy ones,

30:53.954 --> 30:56.890
we should be able to skip
the carnival of a trial

30:56.923 --> 30:58.358
and just send the guy
to prison.

30:58.391 --> 31:01.294
He stabbed him seven times.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.530
How simple can it be?

31:03.564 --> 31:05.131
That's why
the medical examiner

31:05.165 --> 31:07.133
didn't even go to the scene.

31:07.167 --> 31:08.569
That's why
he didn't spend much time

31:08.602 --> 31:10.937
examining the victim's hands.

31:10.971 --> 31:12.673
How much more simple
can a case get?

31:12.706 --> 31:16.242
Why the hell are we
even bothering with a trial?

31:16.276 --> 31:19.680
Drug-dealing scum --
Why even bother?

31:19.713 --> 31:22.248
Hey, look at me.
Am I disturbing you?

31:22.282 --> 31:24.084
You got a problem
listening to this?

31:24.117 --> 31:26.119
Tell the judge,
and he'll let you off.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.654
Mr. Donnell,
do not address the jurors.

31:27.688 --> 31:31.257
Don't address the jurors?
This is my closing argument.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.993
Who should I be talking to,
the wall?

31:33.026 --> 31:33.994
You know what I mean.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.161
Maybe I should talk
to the wall.

31:35.195 --> 31:37.598
Drug-dealing,
stabbing client --

31:37.631 --> 31:39.399
maybe I'll have a better chance
of moving the wall.

31:39.432 --> 31:42.669
This case is like pounding up
against a wall!

31:42.703 --> 31:43.937
Mr. Donnell!

31:43.970 --> 31:44.605
The reason we bother

31:44.638 --> 31:45.606
to go through a trial

31:45.639 --> 31:48.642
is because sometimes
things aren't as they seem.

31:48.675 --> 31:51.144
Sometimes things
aren't so obvious.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.179
The victim tried
to strangle him.

31:53.213 --> 31:55.015
The prosecution doesn't
want to believe that,

31:55.048 --> 31:56.316
you may not want
to believe that,

31:56.349 --> 31:57.684
but you at least
have to ask yourself

31:57.718 --> 32:00.954
if Eddie Wicks planned
to kill Philip Olson,

32:00.987 --> 32:03.256
would he really invite him over
to his own house?

32:03.289 --> 32:07.227
Would it happen in such a messy,
unplanned way?

32:07.260 --> 32:09.730
The victim owed him
over $60,000,

32:09.763 --> 32:12.298
which he was working
on paying back.

32:12.332 --> 32:14.568
Now, most drug dealers
tend to like money

32:14.601 --> 32:16.202
more than murdering people.

32:16.236 --> 32:19.405
Why would he kill the guy
and say goodbye to the money?

32:19.439 --> 32:21.207
Did the prosecution
address that?

32:21.241 --> 32:25.045
Did they offer
any real motive here?

32:25.078 --> 32:26.312
No. They just
count stab wounds --

32:26.346 --> 32:28.749
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 --

32:28.782 --> 32:31.618
and hope you skip over
the motive part.

32:31.652 --> 32:34.287
Now, she talks
about winning and losing

32:34.320 --> 32:36.056
and how disgusting
it's become.

32:36.089 --> 32:37.090
You don't think
they've tried to win?

32:37.123 --> 32:39.392
They've put up
a medical examiner

32:39.425 --> 32:41.327
who listed off a series
of absolute

32:41.361 --> 32:44.097
impossibilities to things
that were possible.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.431
It was, in fact, possible

32:45.465 --> 32:47.768
for a man to get stabbed
in the neck

32:47.801 --> 32:49.770
and yet continue to strangle.

32:49.803 --> 32:52.072
That is possible.

32:52.105 --> 32:55.341
Dr. Foster testified that
it was impossible at first.

32:55.375 --> 32:57.778
Was he mistaken?
Did he lie,

32:57.811 --> 33:01.014
or did he just overstate it,
as he said?

33:01.047 --> 33:03.717
He's up here looking for a win,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.351
You can count on that.

33:05.385 --> 33:07.521
One function
of the medical examiner's job

33:07.554 --> 33:09.322
is to be able to get on
this witness stand

33:09.355 --> 33:12.125
and be a persuasive
prosecutorial witness

33:12.158 --> 33:13.459
and help them
secure convictions,

33:13.493 --> 33:15.762
help them win,

33:15.796 --> 33:19.566
and that's what
he was doing.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.101
Now, the district attorney says

33:21.134 --> 33:25.338
she's ashamed to be
a part of it.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.408
Right now there are over 100
people sitting on death row

33:28.441 --> 33:30.544
for crimes they didn't commit,

33:30.577 --> 33:33.647
and if Eddie Wicks were
convicted in California,

33:33.680 --> 33:36.282
the state that fired Dr. Foster
for being too sloppy,

33:36.316 --> 33:37.818
he would also be on death row.

33:37.851 --> 33:39.820
And how many times
have we seen

33:39.853 --> 33:42.122
after the man sitting
on death row is cleared,

33:42.155 --> 33:45.291
after the guy sitting 30 years
in prison is cleared

33:45.325 --> 33:47.160
on newly discovered
DNA evidence,

33:47.193 --> 33:48.428
or after the wrong man
is executed,

33:48.461 --> 33:51.264
how many times have we seen
the D. A. Say,

33:51.297 --> 33:54.400
"I'm ashamed to be a part
of the process"?

33:54.434 --> 33:57.303
They just say mistakes happen.

33:57.337 --> 34:01.575
Well, that's right,
mistakes happen,

34:01.608 --> 34:04.845
and even when it seems
so obvious, mistakes happen,

34:04.878 --> 34:08.313
and nobody -- not her,
not him, not you --

34:08.348 --> 34:10.416
nobody can be sure
that a big mistake

34:10.449 --> 34:13.418
isn't happening right here
right now.

34:13.453 --> 34:15.856
It could have gone down
exactly the way

34:15.889 --> 34:17.489
my client said it did.

34:17.524 --> 34:19.324
The medical examiner knows it.

34:19.359 --> 34:21.862
You heard him admit on cross
under oath "possible" --

34:21.895 --> 34:24.429
possible it happened
just like Mr. Wicks said,

34:24.464 --> 34:27.668
possible the prosecution
is wrong.

34:27.701 --> 34:28.869
And I am not ashamed
to stand before you

34:28.902 --> 34:31.437
and say you cannot
send a man to prison

34:31.471 --> 34:33.106
for the rest of his life

34:33.139 --> 34:35.576
when there's a chance
the prosecution is wrong.

34:35.609 --> 34:39.145
This is why we have trials,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:39.179 --> 34:43.283
This is why we bother,

34:43.315 --> 34:46.351
and I am not ashamed
to be a part of it.

34:46.386 --> 34:48.454
I am proud
to be a defense attorney.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.724
I am proud to be the one
jumping up and down,

34:50.757 --> 34:53.659
even on cases where everything
seems so obvious.

34:53.694 --> 34:54.860
I am proud to be the one

34:54.895 --> 34:56.862
making the state
prove its burden

34:56.897 --> 34:58.665
beyond all reasonable doubt

34:58.699 --> 35:02.669
before taking
a man's life away forever,

35:02.703 --> 35:07.508
and I do not think
it's a joke.

35:07.541 --> 35:09.576
Now, you have two choices.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.411
You can go back there
and say,

35:11.444 --> 35:14.915
"drug-dealing scum --
let's lock him up anyway,"

35:14.948 --> 35:18.484
or you can admit
there was doubt,

35:18.519 --> 35:21.187
admit the state
put on nothing

35:21.221 --> 35:23.456
to contradict
Eddie Wicks' testimony

35:23.489 --> 35:25.659
and do the job
you were sworn to do

35:25.692 --> 35:29.930
when you signed on as jurors.

35:29.963 --> 35:33.499
But if you choose
to ignore that obligation,

35:33.534 --> 35:37.504
if you choose to say
forget reasonable doubt,

35:37.538 --> 35:40.507
forget the state's burden
of proof

35:40.541 --> 35:44.511
and convict him anyway...

35:44.545 --> 35:49.516
well, then Ms. Gamble's right,
after all.

35:49.550 --> 35:54.521
The system is, in fact...

35:54.555 --> 35:56.857
a joke.

36:16.510 --> 36:17.611
He was good.

36:17.644 --> 36:18.612
All he needed to do

36:18.645 --> 36:19.613
was persuade
one lone imbecile,

36:19.646 --> 36:21.247
and he's got --

36:21.281 --> 36:22.248
he's not going
to persuade.

36:22.282 --> 36:23.349
Helen,
you said it yourself --

36:23.383 --> 36:24.818
one idiot
beats a conviction.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.920
He just delivered
a damn good closing argument.

36:26.953 --> 36:28.555
So, maybe they'll beat
murder one.

36:28.589 --> 36:30.356
Even with murder two,
they've got an appeal.

36:30.390 --> 36:31.592
Ay, but Swackheim's right.

36:31.625 --> 36:33.426
With a murder two conviction
in the bank,

36:33.459 --> 36:35.261
they'll have to plead out
on manslaughter.

36:37.531 --> 36:38.464
You believe that?

36:38.498 --> 36:40.601
Guy stabs somebody
seven times,

36:40.634 --> 36:44.270
we're sitting here looking
at manslaughter as a victory.

36:53.313 --> 36:54.515
You phoned it in.

36:58.752 --> 37:01.622
Thanks.

37:01.655 --> 37:03.657
Something I said?

37:06.292 --> 37:10.030
It's not that I believe
in you, Eddie.

37:10.063 --> 37:13.634
It's more like...

37:13.667 --> 37:16.570
I need to believe in me.

37:17.804 --> 37:20.373
That and you're not
positive I'm guilty.

37:20.406 --> 37:24.244
And there's that.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.553
( door opens )

37:32.586 --> 37:35.421
Bobby,
the judge wants to see you.

37:42.629 --> 37:45.031
As soon as we get
our verdict,

37:45.065 --> 37:48.769
you will be proceeding
directly to jail,

37:48.802 --> 37:50.403
whether your client does
or not.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.572
Why?

37:51.605 --> 37:53.540
Because I'm holding you
in contempt.

37:53.574 --> 37:55.676
The only reason
I didn't do it earlier

37:55.709 --> 37:58.512
is because I didn't want
to prejudice the case,

37:58.545 --> 38:00.514
but the disrespect
you have shown me

38:00.547 --> 38:02.448
in this trial will not
go unpunished, counselor.

38:02.482 --> 38:04.084
Look, I know you're out
of your mind --

38:04.117 --> 38:06.419
Bobby.
Keep talking.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.253
You say you don't want
to prejudice the case --

38:07.287 --> 38:09.389
you call my client scum
in open court.

38:09.690 --> 38:11.391
The fact that you even let
this thing continue --

38:11.424 --> 38:12.793
any disrespect
I showed to you

38:12.826 --> 38:14.394
was well earned,
trust me.

38:14.427 --> 38:15.228
Listen, you little --

38:15.261 --> 38:16.396
You should at least
have the integrity

38:16.429 --> 38:18.799
To hold yourself
in contempt.

38:18.832 --> 38:20.500
You were a blight
on that room.

38:20.534 --> 38:21.968
You should have your robe
stripped away,

38:22.002 --> 38:23.436
and when this case is over,

38:23.469 --> 38:25.872
in addition to all
of my appeals on record,

38:25.906 --> 38:28.542
I will be bringing a motion
to have you removed

38:28.575 --> 38:30.110
because judges like you
are a cancer.
And I hope you win!

38:30.143 --> 38:31.812
Yes, I would rather
sit by a beach

38:31.845 --> 38:33.547
instead of listening
to lawyers like you...
You're a dead rot!

38:33.580 --> 38:34.981
And if this system has
any chance of ever working,

38:35.015 --> 38:37.050
with your gross,
vile clients
it has to weed itself

38:37.083 --> 38:38.519
who violate me...
of people who have
no business being judges,

38:38.552 --> 38:40.420
and you would be
at the top of the list!

38:40.453 --> 38:41.922
That the stench
it's become --
You are disgraceful!

38:41.955 --> 38:44.725
You are the stench!
You bring the stink!

38:44.758 --> 38:45.792
You are an arrogant redneck
son of a bitch!

38:45.826 --> 38:47.427
Well, you can bring it
right into the cell with you!

38:47.460 --> 38:49.462
This is all your fault!
All of it!

38:49.495 --> 38:52.432
( door opens )

38:52.465 --> 38:53.834
Jury's back.

39:05.478 --> 39:07.113
The defendant
will please rise.

39:08.882 --> 39:11.451
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has reached its verdict?

39:11.484 --> 39:12.118
We have.

39:12.152 --> 39:13.887
What say you?

39:13.920 --> 39:18.424
"326447 -- Commonwealth
vs Edward Wicks.

39:18.458 --> 39:20.627
"on the count of murder
in the first degree,

39:20.661 --> 39:23.764
"we find the defendant,
Edward Wicks, not guilty.

39:23.797 --> 39:28.669
"326448 -- on the count
of murder in the second degree,

39:28.702 --> 39:32.639
we find the defendant,
Edward Wicks, not guilty."

39:33.574 --> 39:35.408
What?

39:35.441 --> 39:37.443
Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

39:37.477 --> 39:38.879
You call that service?

39:38.912 --> 39:41.515
What are you, morons?
Ms. Gamble! Ms. Gamble!

39:41.548 --> 39:43.750
What, do you like the color
of Mr. Donnell's tie?

39:43.784 --> 39:46.553
Ms. Gamble!
I don't care, judge!
That's it!

39:46.587 --> 39:48.889
That's it.
This is what happens

39:48.922 --> 39:50.557
when you get 12 people

39:50.591 --> 39:53.527
too stupid to get out
of jury duty.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.961
You end up with a bunch
of unemployed,

39:54.995 --> 39:57.063
brain-dead idiots!

39:57.097 --> 39:58.799
Tell me,
what would it take here?

39:58.832 --> 40:00.934
Did he have to stab the guy
eight times?

40:00.967 --> 40:03.436
One more word!
Come on, raise your hands!

40:03.469 --> 40:06.172
Which one of you retards
voted not guilty?

40:06.206 --> 40:08.141
All right, Helen.
That's it.
You're in contempt.

40:08.174 --> 40:10.511
Throw them in contempt!

40:10.544 --> 40:12.112
Why don't you
invite the defendant over

40:12.145 --> 40:13.680
for Christmas dinner, huh?

40:13.714 --> 40:16.149
Let him carve the turkey,
you idiots!

40:16.182 --> 40:17.017
Get her out!
Take her away!

40:17.050 --> 40:20.787
Not guilty by reason
of jury's insanity!

40:20.821 --> 40:22.488
You morons!

40:22.523 --> 40:25.892
Bailiff, take
Mr. Donnell away, too.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.528
He knows why.

40:27.561 --> 40:28.662
What did you do?

40:28.695 --> 40:30.831
It's a long story.

40:35.201 --> 40:38.539
so, that leaves you and me
to celebrate, right?

40:38.572 --> 40:40.440
Maybe next time.

40:53.887 --> 40:57.891
Well, at least he let us
share the same cell.

41:00.260 --> 41:04.631
Yep. Won't Lindsay
be thrilled,

41:04.665 --> 41:06.767
you and I sharing
a room again?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.969
Funny.

41:09.002 --> 41:12.873
Okay, tell me.
I can take it.

41:12.906 --> 41:15.976
Did I make a mistake
in the trial?

41:16.009 --> 41:18.244
Should I have done
something differently?

41:18.278 --> 41:20.013
What, did I appear
unsympathetic,

41:20.046 --> 41:22.148
returning
with a concussion?

41:22.182 --> 41:23.717
I don't know.

41:23.750 --> 41:26.620
The medical examiner
didn't help you much.

41:53.847 --> 41:55.682
Maybe I could have
handled things better.

41:55.716 --> 41:59.686
It doesn't work. That's why
I'm like I am in there.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.156
The process doesn't work.
I get frustrated.

42:03.189 --> 42:07.694
Well, maybe it could work
if you do things right.

42:07.728 --> 42:10.296
Works worse
when I do things right.

42:10.330 --> 42:14.868
Why don't you
get off the bench?

42:14.901 --> 42:18.772
It's a thought.

42:18.805 --> 42:22.609
French fries?

42:28.849 --> 42:30.951
Two more hours,
you can go.

43:22.035 --> 43:23.103
You stinker!
