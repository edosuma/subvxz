00:17.625 --> 00:18.541
Interesting.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.083
With light of this wavelength,

00:20.166 --> 00:22.833
there should be some observable
thermal emanation.

00:27.916 --> 00:32.791
Energy radiates from the stone,
but not in any form I've encountered.

00:33.958 --> 00:35.166
Hmm.

00:37.541 --> 00:39.291
Tests are required.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.833
Amazing.
The energy seems to influence

00:44.916 --> 00:47.375
the mental states of living beings.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.458
Individually, the test subjects appear…

00:50.041 --> 00:50.916
smarter.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.416
They've spontaneously evolved
into a superorganism.

01:03.291 --> 01:07.000
They no longer seem to recognize
unexposed members of their species

01:07.083 --> 01:08.750
as anything other than food.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.541
No.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.541
Father, what a perfectly awful time
for you to be away.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.583
You're so slow!

02:33.583 --> 02:34.666
-I'm gonna get you.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.583
Ha!

02:35.666 --> 02:37.000
-Hey!

02:37.083 --> 02:39.000
-You're it!

02:42.041 --> 02:43.333
What is that?

02:51.250 --> 02:52.208
Race you there.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.208
Can you see it?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.000
By the Dawn Star.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.916
I don't like it.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.916
Hey! Come back!

03:34.791 --> 03:39.125
The damn noise
wakes the entire block.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.583
Surely, His Excellency sees the value…

03:41.666 --> 03:45.916
The copper ingots were counterfeit,
and he was rude to my servant.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.875
He must be punished.

03:47.958 --> 03:50.125
…filled with villains and scum.

03:50.208 --> 03:54.541
And I see guards there daily.
The Shoehorn must be cleaned out.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.166
The Imperium must not be sullied
by poor policing.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.250
I will speak
with the captain of the guard.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.625
-Your father would have already--

04:02.416 --> 04:06.000
My father appreciates your concern.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.916
That will be all for today.

04:08.833 --> 04:14.083
Sherzi! Oh, gods, please!
Where is my wife?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.458
Sherzi?

04:16.708 --> 04:18.333
I demand to see her.

04:18.416 --> 04:19.333
Father?

04:19.416 --> 04:20.875
Emperor Zal?

04:20.958 --> 04:22.000
Go away.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.250
It's me.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.500
It's Sherzi. I'm here. Come open the door.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.125
You're all right. I'm here.

04:32.208 --> 04:37.791
Oh, Sherzi. My dear wife.
I've been so worried.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.250
Come sit. Here, you must be hungry.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.208
What troubles you?

04:44.291 --> 04:47.333
Our daughter. She is not prepared.

04:47.416 --> 04:50.208
Mirana is stronger than you know.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.916
There's more to taking the throne
than strength.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.166
Making decisions for which
no one else can muster the courage.

04:59.250 --> 05:04.625
Seeing where others are blind.
Braving the darkness alone.

05:04.708 --> 05:08.083
She will do everything she can
to make you proud.

05:08.666 --> 05:11.125
Every time I look upon her,
I see our failure.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.250
Enter!

05:16.541 --> 05:19.000
Captain.
I hope this is important.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.250
I wouldn't have intruded otherwise,
Highness.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.625
Something happened.
An incident in the Hinterlands.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.791
You're needed in the throne room.

05:28.958 --> 05:30.083
Mirana?

05:31.750 --> 05:33.166
Where did your mother go?

05:35.625 --> 05:38.500
Sherzi? Sherzi?

05:44.166 --> 05:47.000
Tell us exactly what you saw.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.125
Monsters.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.916
I barely made it out alive.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.208
You must go. Burn them out.

05:53.291 --> 05:55.625
There's more you're not saying.
Out with it.

05:56.916 --> 05:59.208
It's not just what I saw.

05:59.291 --> 06:03.833
It's what I felt, pushed through my skull.

06:04.416 --> 06:08.916
The world spun, and my soul teetered
on the edge of an abyss.

06:09.708 --> 06:13.625
A red glow to swallow up
all law and reason.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.708
I felt the truth. We are nothing.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.708
So, you had a bad dream.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.458
Pardon her apprehension,
but the claims you make are strange.

06:24.541 --> 06:25.750
You want proof.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.291
The proof is in the blood.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.833
Alert the guard.

06:52.541 --> 06:55.041
I ride to the Hinterlands myself.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.541
-Three days' march for this.
-Easy now.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.666
Where in the Seven Hells is everyone?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.666
Where could they have gone?

07:13.750 --> 07:16.625
It's as though they all left at once
in the night.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.625
Your Highness.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.458
Oh, I was beginning to fear
you would never come.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.291
More trouble with the Coriel'Tauvi?

07:30.375 --> 07:33.041
Mene's Provincial Governor
in the Scintillant Waste

07:33.125 --> 07:36.250
thought that she might collect tribute
from our border regions.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.625
I relayed your father's objections.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.208
I hope you were polite.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.625
Hmm, things became heated.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.833
Do you think the Coriel'Tauvi
are responsible for this?

07:44.916 --> 07:46.375
No.

07:46.458 --> 07:50.583
The Principality of Shadow
is not usually given to such subtlety.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.666
It's the same around the perimeter.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.958
Abandoned property. Empty silence.

07:56.541 --> 07:58.083
Could you see anything from above?

07:58.166 --> 08:00.000
Not through this fog.

08:00.083 --> 08:03.250
So, we're marching blind,
in the middle of the night,

08:03.333 --> 08:08.625
into the arms of an adversary
we cannot identify and do not understand?

08:09.333 --> 08:10.416
Perfect.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.541
Forward then.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.083
-Halt!

08:39.875 --> 08:42.041
By the Dawn Star. What was she?

08:46.708 --> 08:48.083
Hold steady.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.833
Shields! Form ranks!

09:37.458 --> 09:38.375
The villagers.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.125
It's all of them.

09:40.750 --> 09:41.666
They're all…

09:44.291 --> 09:46.125
-Burn it to the ground.
-Done.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.833
<i>Remember.</i>

10:15.666 --> 10:17.000
Give it some room, Highness.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.166
You saw what it did to these people.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.708
Yes. You're wise, of course.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.958
One damned rock did all this.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.583
I'm more disquieted by a question.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.541
What if there are more?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.916
What if this is only the start
of something else?

10:41.625 --> 10:43.041
<i>Something worse?</i>

10:52.916 --> 10:57.291
Princess, I hope the soldiers
I lent the throne served you well.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.750
They did.
My father and the Empire thank you.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.166
Oh, your father.

11:01.791 --> 11:05.541
I have not seen your father in many suns.

11:05.625 --> 11:09.416
The demands on his time and energy
are difficult to overstate.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.500
Hm. And the demands on you, Princess,
what of them?

11:13.583 --> 11:15.750
Spit it out. You want something.

11:15.833 --> 11:19.125
Only the opportunity to serve the throne.

11:19.208 --> 11:22.083
I see how restless you are, Princess.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.666
Name me Regent.

11:23.750 --> 11:27.625
Perhaps I can ease the demands
on you both.

11:27.708 --> 11:32.041
Your kind concern
is always so appreciated, Legatus.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.166
And thank you again for the troops.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.666
Your Highness.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.833
She's more snake than a woman.

11:46.708 --> 11:48.333
Mirana, you have returned.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.333
Father, you seem to be having a good day.

11:51.416 --> 11:54.416
The days are always good
under our unflagging sun.

11:54.500 --> 11:59.583
In the night, though, I must admit,
dark times do visit upon me.

11:59.666 --> 12:00.750
How was your trip?

12:00.833 --> 12:02.625
I encountered something.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.708
Something awful and powerful.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.083
A stone that glowed crimson.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.375
-A stone?
-What is it?

12:10.458 --> 12:14.583
A half-remembered dream or a nightmare
that came to me while you were gone.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.250
I saw a red rock, in a cave…

12:18.041 --> 12:19.458
in the snow.

12:19.541 --> 12:23.458
You were lost in its song.

12:25.041 --> 12:27.500
It was only a dream, Father.

12:27.583 --> 12:30.958
Do not trust me. Do not rely on me.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.125
Even sanity feels like madness now.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.541
Oh.

12:35.625 --> 12:36.958
Don't say that.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.583
Death comes for me. Prepare for it.

12:41.166 --> 12:45.291
When you were born,
the Oracle offered you a gift of prophecy.

12:45.375 --> 12:50.083
He told me I would know when the time
had come for you to collect it.

12:50.916 --> 12:55.208
Find him. Take the stone.
Find your answers.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.916
I don't want to leave you again.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.083
You must.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.458
Just remember,

12:59.541 --> 13:04.000
the Oracle speaks truths
that sound like lies

13:04.083 --> 13:06.708
and lies that conceal the truth.

13:06.791 --> 13:08.250
He foresaw this.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.333
Or perhaps-- Or perhaps,
I just imagined it.

13:16.791 --> 13:21.000
Sherzi! There you are. Sing with me.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.416
Of course.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.125
You know that little voice
in your head,

13:43.208 --> 13:46.000
the one that chimes in
when you're trying to decide something?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.875
It always leaves me wondering,

13:47.958 --> 13:52.000
is that the true me or is that the devil
tempting me to error?

13:52.083 --> 13:54.375
You're still thinking
about those monsters in the village.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.208
No, the Oracle.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.333
What if he tells me things
that wouldn't have come true

13:59.416 --> 14:00.500
if he hadn't spoken?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.625
Fate always seemed a noose to me.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.750
Well, there's fate, and there's destiny.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.375
Fate is for cowards and fools.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.750
Destiny is what you make it.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.625
Destiny.

14:39.083 --> 14:44.500
Mirana, daughter of Zal,
Princess of the Sun…

14:45.625 --> 14:47.791
come to say farewell.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.166
You must know why I'm here.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.291
Oh, not even you know why you're here,

14:55.875 --> 14:58.750
because you have not yet arrived.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.333
I don't understand.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.208
Of course not. Not now.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.083
Not yet.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.916
I will make you some tea.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.625
Under the shadow of this red rock,

15:09.708 --> 15:12.291
you will see what blinds you.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.958
Come in, under the shadow.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.875
You will have your answers,

15:16.958 --> 15:20.041
and you will wish
you never sought them at all.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.583
Do I have a choice?

15:21.666 --> 15:26.166
You are free.
You can leave my temple now, as you will.

15:26.250 --> 15:30.250
But we both know,
as much as it feels like a decision,

15:30.333 --> 15:34.833
your path has been set
since the moment you saw the Direstone.

15:34.916 --> 15:35.750
Direstone?

15:48.416 --> 15:49.458
<i>Remember.</i>

15:57.416 --> 15:58.875
I remember.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.916
I'm not me.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.541
Not this me.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.708
Hah. The hiss of fate.

16:04.791 --> 16:08.250
He did this. The Invoker did this.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.250
No. The Pillars of Creation did.

16:11.333 --> 16:15.166
He used them,
collapsing all realities into one.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.416
This one.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.958
He silenced infinite souls.

16:19.041 --> 16:24.916
But your voice,
a god's voice pierced the void.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.583
The Pillars of Creation?

16:27.625 --> 16:30.333
If they made this,
then this can be unmade.

16:31.666 --> 16:34.416
With more difficulty than you know.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.333
I'm afraid your divinity has fled you.

16:38.416 --> 16:43.958
What power you have
is granted by your father and destiny.

16:44.041 --> 16:49.291
Your Radiance, the prophecy you came for,
I would speak it.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.916
Thank you, no.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.708
I've heard your prophecies before.

16:53.791 --> 16:57.458
The Devil of the Moon
would turn Selemene's lotuses against her,

16:57.541 --> 17:01.083
heralding the return of Mene
and the destruction of all things.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.666
That came true, it seems.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.500
Yes, it came true.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.375
But tell me, was it fate,
or was it destiny?

17:09.458 --> 17:12.000
You'll forgive me
if I leave that question to you.

17:12.875 --> 17:18.166
You will travel into darkness,
and save what you love

17:18.250 --> 17:21.750
by allowing what you've loved to die.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.041
<i>Restoration requires destruction,</i>

17:26.125 --> 17:30.166
<i>Princess of the Sun, Princess of the Moon,</i>

17:30.250 --> 17:33.500
<i>Princess of nothing at all.</i>

17:43.875 --> 17:45.083
Marci?

17:46.291 --> 17:48.583
Oh, gods, Marci.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.583
Let me look at you.

17:56.916 --> 17:58.875
The Oracle
said something obnoxious.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.500
I would have separated him
from his tongue long ago.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.416
But the bastard always saw me coming.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.458
He was… obscure.

18:06.541 --> 18:09.083
And why do you look like
you just came from a funeral?

18:09.166 --> 18:10.083
It's nothing.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.041
It seems more than nothing.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.625
Have you ever had a dream
where someone you love wronged you?

18:15.708 --> 18:19.708
You know they did nothing,
yet, the sting remains.

18:19.791 --> 18:21.375
I wronged you in a dream.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.791
You were wronged more gravely.

18:23.875 --> 18:26.375
My father, he is not well.

18:26.458 --> 18:30.291
I know you will care for him
and care for the people.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.666
Princess?

18:31.750 --> 18:34.083
I will not be returning
to The Imperium.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.041
Where you go, we follow.

18:36.125 --> 18:39.000
Where I go now, the guard, their captain,

18:39.083 --> 18:42.125
and The Slayer would be noticed,
and quite unwelcome.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.625
You're headed into Shadowlands.

18:43.708 --> 18:47.166
I won't leave you unescorted
to the tender mercies of the elves.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.833
You can, and you will.

18:49.916 --> 18:52.958
Please, stay by my father's side,
both of you.

18:53.041 --> 18:57.291
Do not trust Tihomir,
and do not trust my uncle.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.000
You're not making any sense.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.500
Trust I am trying to set things right.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.083
Lina.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.583
You worry you are capable
only of destruction.

19:07.666 --> 19:08.916
I know better.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.125
I'm not from this world.

19:18.041 --> 19:23.375
I'm not the Mirana you grew up with,
and loved, and served so selflessly.

19:24.708 --> 19:28.166
And you're not my Marci,
but I watched you…

19:28.250 --> 19:29.916
watched her…

19:30.000 --> 19:31.666
Gods, it's…

19:33.208 --> 19:36.250
The Mirana you knew
thought there was no greater pain

19:36.333 --> 19:39.541
than looking into her father's eyes
and seeing a stranger.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.833
But in the other world,
the one I come from,

19:42.916 --> 19:45.583
Father was right. I failed.

19:45.666 --> 19:49.291
I lost you. I lost-- I lost everything.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.041
There are two paths before me.

19:56.125 --> 20:00.916
Down the first,
righting a wrong so perverse,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.875
I can't even comprehend it completely.

20:03.958 --> 20:08.208
Down the other, this life.
This stranger's life.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.958
I feel trapped in someone else's dream.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.125
Where is it?

20:16.375 --> 20:17.416
It's gone.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.208
Well, how could it be gone?

20:20.875 --> 20:22.708
There's only one moon.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.666
The threat is unprecedented.

20:27.750 --> 20:32.333
The stones have fallen all over the world,
even here in the Nightsilver Woods.

20:32.416 --> 20:34.625
Where they land, chaos follows.

20:35.250 --> 20:38.625
And where are they falling from?

20:38.708 --> 20:39.958
The moon, Highness.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.916
Our moon is crumbling
and raining this down upon our heads.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.458
The moon.

20:45.541 --> 20:49.166
Then they are gifts from Mene.
This must be her will.

20:49.250 --> 20:53.541
If they are gifts,
they are strange and troubling gifts.

20:53.625 --> 20:58.875
N-- Not every creature, so exposed,
is reduced to a gibbering cannibal.

20:58.958 --> 21:03.833
A few, a very few, seem able to resist
the worst of the effects

21:03.916 --> 21:07.083
<i>and are visibly… empowered instead.</i>

21:07.166 --> 21:12.625
<i>Just a handful of such beings
could pose a threat to the Dark Moon Order</i>

21:12.708 --> 21:16.583
and our Lady's ability
to maintain peace across her dominion.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.500
The Helio Imperium
and Zal's Praetorian Guard

21:19.583 --> 21:21.041
have already been troublesome.

21:21.125 --> 21:24.041
You're saying that those troubles
would grow?

21:24.125 --> 21:26.333
Perhaps exponentially, Highness.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.833
I would request an audience with our Lady.

21:28.916 --> 21:31.625
If she has some intent,
I would like to divine it.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.666
Impossible.

21:35.750 --> 21:40.958
Forgive my daughter.
She isn't usually given to overreaction.

21:41.041 --> 21:43.291
Disturbing the goddess
is quite unnecessary.

21:43.375 --> 21:46.333
The stones can be collected,
their effects contained.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.750
I will personally see to it.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.916
<i>Overreaction?</i>

21:52.000 --> 21:54.541
These stones may be a conduit
for an entity

21:54.625 --> 21:56.666
whose power could surpass any of the gods.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.625
Quite a conclusion.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.833
I don't imagine you shared it
with The Althing.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.875
Of course, I didn't.

22:02.958 --> 22:05.166
Something like that? They're not prepared.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.333
Correct.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.958
What are you…

22:09.041 --> 22:12.708
Some mysteries
are better left as mysteries.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.041
That applies to them, not me.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.875
Filomena, for once,
when I tell you something, listen.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.416
I always listen.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
Listen and obey.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.875
This is dangerous. This is death.

22:27.958 --> 22:30.125
Leave this problem to me.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.791
Trust that I know best.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.208
Fine.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.291
I am proud of you.

22:36.916 --> 22:39.833
You're all that matters to me.
Trust that, too.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.916
You're wrong, Father. I listen.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.041
It's the obey part
I've never been very good at.

23:07.083 --> 23:11.875
He said, "Tonight, we dine!
Tonight, we drink!

23:11.958 --> 23:14.458
The village is saved!"

23:14.541 --> 23:16.416
-To Bram!

23:17.000 --> 23:19.208
I'll return with fresh cups for everyone.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.875
Barkeep, another round.

23:26.458 --> 23:29.583
It's good to see
some things haven't changed.

23:29.666 --> 23:31.708
Sorry. What hasn't changed?

23:32.291 --> 23:36.000
Your love of jumping in front of lines
at bars, Davion.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.500
Of course. It's you.

23:42.166 --> 23:45.416
Took me a second in this dim light.
Um, let me get you a drink.

23:45.500 --> 23:49.208
Your favorite is… something strong.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.750
Whiskey, right?
We had a wild night after--

23:52.833 --> 23:55.208
I'm not one
of your nameless conquests.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.333
They all have names, lovely.

23:57.416 --> 24:00.625
But I'm in my cups, and my memory
just isn't what it was when…

24:00.708 --> 24:03.541
Yeah, I'm not here
to share a drink or your bed.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.708
I have a need of a Dragon Knight.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.416
I have need of you.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.833
This wyrmling you've slain.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.125
I'm hunting something bigger.

24:11.208 --> 24:12.750
-The Crimson Devil.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.791
The Father of Fire.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.500
I'm hunting Slyrak.
