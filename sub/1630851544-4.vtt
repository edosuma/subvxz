WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.524
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:02.567 --> 00:04.874
- How's your mom doing?
- Good. Uh, transplant took.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.441
She's out of prison, too,

00:06.484 --> 00:07.746
living at the halfway house.
Thanks for asking.

00:07.790 --> 00:08.921
20-Squad might
not be re-forming.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.575
What's Hondo got
to say about this?

00:10.619 --> 00:12.012
<i>Rumor is he's in Mexico,</i>

00:12.055 --> 00:13.361
<i>but nobody
from SWAT's heard from him.</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:14.666
I'm sorry I haven't
given you an answer about us.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.625
I don't want you
to feel pressured.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.106
When I was in Germany,
I, um... I didn't need

00:19.149 --> 00:23.110
20-Squad to get me through my
time away, but I did need you.

00:23.153 --> 00:26.330
Soon as we get the new
assignments, I'm asking you out.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.897
It's time to get back to work.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.247
- 20-Squad's been reinstated.
- Who's team leader?

00:30.291 --> 00:31.988
<i>Sanchez comes to us</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:33.903
<i>with the commission's
full seal of approval.</i>

00:33.946 --> 00:35.122
Why are you here, exactly?

00:35.165 --> 00:36.688
This is SWAT.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.168
This is the brass ring
every cop's reaching for.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.170
Look, I know you. There's no way
that you'd do that

00:40.214 --> 00:41.998
unless there was something
in it for you.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.784
This whole thing with Sanchez--
it doesn't strike you as wrong?

00:45.828 --> 00:47.134
Luca, I knew
what I was coming back to.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.092
There's no way
a guy like Sanchez

00:49.136 --> 00:50.833
comes back here
without an agenda.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.574
When the bosses heard
that you were returning to SWAT,

00:52.617 --> 00:54.750
they came up with a plan.
Rodrigo Sanchez.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.578
They sent him
to get you to quit.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.015
Sanchez is in on this?

01:07.154 --> 01:09.069
Yo, Tomas, we got
what we came for.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.679
Let's get out of here.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.204
- Sentinel?
- Yeah, I think
they're still in there.

01:14.248 --> 01:17.033
Whoa, man.
What the hell you doing?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.165
Stay there.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.994
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.996
Tomas Hernandez?

01:24.040 --> 01:26.086
We know you're in there.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.396
<i>Reports of shots fired,</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:34.355
<i>600 block of North Bell Street.</i>

01:34.398 --> 01:35.747
<i>22-David to Command.</i>

01:35.791 --> 01:37.967
<i>Show 26-David and me responding.</i>

01:39.795 --> 01:42.363
911 caller said there might be
up to four shooters.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.365
Figures. The one day
we carpool in to work.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.018
22-David,

01:46.062 --> 01:47.803
the next responding officer
is five minutes out.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.197
Okay. Looks like we're
flying solo. Let's go.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.505
LAPD.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.377
Hands in the air.
Hands in the air.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.640
We're just recording
for the Sentinel app.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.120
Look, get across the street
and take cover.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.122
Do not approach,
or we'll arrest you. You go it?

02:02.165 --> 02:04.211
Drop that bat.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.893
LAPD! Drop your weapon!

02:34.937 --> 02:36.895
- Don't shoot!
- Drop the weapon.
Drop it!

02:36.939 --> 02:38.506
- Don't shoot.
- Drop the gun and put your
hands behind your back.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.638
I'm not who you're looking for.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.814
- You the homeowner?
- No, I live a few blocks away.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.164
I'm just trying
to help out.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.687
Hey, miss, we're LAPD.
We're gonna get you

02:45.730 --> 02:47.210
some help, okay?
Can you tell me your name?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.386
- Mm. Mm.
- Luca, she should get

02:49.430 --> 02:50.822
- to a hospital ASAP.
22-David.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.259
We're Code 4,
one suspect in custody.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.999
Requesting emergency transport

02:54.043 --> 02:56.132
for one victim.
Multiple GSWs.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.439
If you don't live here, how'd
you know she needed help?

02:58.482 --> 03:00.745
I saw a robbery alert pop up
on Sentinel, so I rushed over.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.313
She's going into shock.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.238
Whatever went down here,

03:15.282 --> 03:16.761
I take it it woke up
the whole neighborhood.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.502
Yeah. Looks like
an attempted robbery gone bad.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.852
Gunshot victim's on route
to the hospital as we speak.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.941
- Where's Street?
- He got called back to HQ.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.509
Hicks wanted to see him.
Something urgent.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.511
- Everything okay?
- We're in the dark on that, too.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.339
Probably the way
Sanchez wants it.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.864
I looped Deac in on him.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.431
So how are we gonna handle
him now, going forward?

03:34.475 --> 03:36.259
- Still working that out.
- If he's playing games

03:36.303 --> 03:38.783
in the field, that
- could be a safety issue.
- Deac's right.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.743
20-Squad will have your back.
I'll tell the team.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.180
Let's keep it between us
for now.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.921
Till we find out
what Sanchez is really after.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.836
Whatever it is,
he ain't gonna win.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.968
In the meantime, let's get
some witness statements.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.717
- Hey.
Hey.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.938
what's going on?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.722
Why don't you sit down, Jim?

04:07.159 --> 04:09.292
It's my mom, isn't it?

04:09.336 --> 04:11.642
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but

04:11.686 --> 04:14.602
your mother passed away.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.303
When?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.697
- This morning.
- How'd she die?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.394
It's too early to say,

04:24.438 --> 04:26.788
but there were no signs
of force or trauma.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.964
But drugs?

04:30.748 --> 04:32.707
Paraphernalia and residue

04:32.750 --> 04:35.100
were found on the scene,
so, probably, yeah.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.712
So, uh, I donated
a piece of my liver

04:37.755 --> 04:41.019
in a risky surgery
to give her a second--

04:41.063 --> 04:43.326
well, no, 12th chance--

04:43.370 --> 04:46.938
and she's out of prison
less than two months...

04:49.637 --> 04:51.769
...and she OD's.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.423
Perfect.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.338
You're gonna have
intense feelings.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.514
It's understandable,
and it's normal.

04:57.558 --> 05:00.300
I'm here to talk
- if you need.
- Thank you.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.344
I'll clear your bereavement

05:01.388 --> 05:02.345
with Sergeant Sanchez.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.564
You take all the time you need.

05:03.607 --> 05:04.695
No, I'd rather stay

05:04.739 --> 05:06.001
and focus on work.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.394
You might want
to take two or three days

05:07.437 --> 05:08.873
to process things.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.614
Grief takes
many different forms.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.355
None of them are predictable.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.836
Grief might not be predictable,
but she was.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.666
Look, everyone
here knows

05:18.709 --> 05:21.408
my relationship with
my mom was messed up.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.584
I loved her,

05:23.627 --> 05:27.239
but at least now,
I know she's at peace.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.460
Sir...

05:30.504 --> 05:32.375
I'm okay.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.033
Look, um,

05:38.076 --> 05:41.166
if your focus slips at all,

05:41.210 --> 05:44.300
I'm pulling you from the field,
understood?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.433
Yeah.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.001
Sorry about your mom, Jim.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.570
Back to work.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
Right call?

06:00.577 --> 06:03.885
Situation like this,
there's no right call.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.064
Yeah.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.197
<i>Look, I already</i>

06:12.241 --> 06:13.938
told you guys, I was
just trying save Serena

06:13.982 --> 06:15.853
from the robbers-- Tomas
Hernandez and his buddies.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.812
You affiliated
with Tomas's crew?

06:17.855 --> 06:19.727
- Then how do you know his name?
- It's all over Sentinel.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.946
Sentinel Guard?
You mean the public safety app?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.818
- I just downloaded
Facebook, like, last month

06:23.861 --> 06:26.081
so someone's got to fill me
in on the technicalities.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.778
Sentinel Guard's an app
that pulls crime info off

06:27.822 --> 06:30.128
of police scanners and publishes
it to users in the area.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.174
It also lets users report
crimes and submit tips.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.524
I thought that's
what 911 is for.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.396
- Cops don't care about this crew.
- Says you.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.049
You think we showed up
here on a whim?

06:38.093 --> 06:39.486
Hernandez and his
buddies have been

06:39.529 --> 06:41.357
preying on this
neighborhood for weeks.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.054
They just shot the owner of
Leavitt's Pharmacy yesterday.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.969
So when I heard they were here
at Serena's house,

06:45.013 --> 06:46.449
- I stepped in.
- Well, you playing

06:46.493 --> 06:48.103
vigilante might have
got your neighbor killed.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.496
That thought
ever cross your mind?

06:49.539 --> 06:51.019
Look, I got here
before you guys did.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.455
I'm just trying to
defend my neighborhood.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.196
Lot of the Sentinel users
would do the same.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.504
Good Samaritan or not,
you better hope

06:57.547 --> 07:00.158
none of the bullets in Serena
trace back to your gun.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.682
If he's telling the truth,

07:01.725 --> 07:03.248
we've still got
three violent robbers out there.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.336
Plus angry civilians

07:04.380 --> 07:05.729
itching to turn vigilante.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.731
Looks like we better
help RHD find these guys

07:07.775 --> 07:09.820
before robberies
turn into homicides.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.168
Looks like the homeowner
who got shot, Serena Fuentes,

07:53.211 --> 07:56.214
is gonna pull through, no thanks
to that vigilante neighbor.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.607
That would be Marc Grantley.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.870
No priors,
legally registered firearm,

07:59.914 --> 08:01.655
lives a few blocks
down from Serena.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.352
All signs indicate
that he's telling the truth

08:03.395 --> 08:05.136
about Tomas Hernandez
doing the shooting.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.487
RHD's been tracking Hernandez
for a few weeks,

08:07.530 --> 08:09.271
but we haven't made
much headway.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.751
No known address. We haven't got
a clear look at his associates.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.797
- Buttoned-up crew?
- Not especially,

08:13.841 --> 08:15.364
but they're growing more violent
by the day,

08:15.407 --> 08:17.105
and I'm up to my eyeballs
in open cases.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.933
Could really use your help
on this one.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.282
Well, what are friends for,
Detective?

08:20.325 --> 08:22.327
Tomas Hernandez.
Record for assault,

08:22.371 --> 08:24.242
suspected in over a half
dozen armed robberies,

08:24.286 --> 08:27.071
most recent one being
Serena Fuentes's home

08:27.115 --> 08:28.899
and Leavitt's Pharmacy.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.902
They hit the pharmacy yesterday,
- shot two workers.
- Any luck

08:31.946 --> 08:33.382
- with surveillance footage?
- No dice.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.340
But we're not the only ones
looking for him.

08:35.384 --> 08:36.516
Are you talking
about the wannabe jokers

08:36.559 --> 08:37.865
- on the Sentinel Guard app?
- No.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.562
Talking about Hernandez's
gambling problem.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.217
He's got ties
to Mikhal Kovic, aka... Russian Mike.

08:42.260 --> 08:45.046
Tan, haven't we dealt
with this guy before?
Yeah.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.221
If Hernandez racked up
some gambling debts,

08:46.264 --> 08:47.527
he could be getting desperate.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.745
Would explain the uptick
in violence.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.660
You and Chris talk
to Russian Mike,

08:50.704 --> 08:52.444
see what Hernandez owes him.
You can fill us in on any leads

08:52.488 --> 08:54.403
on the other
- two suspects.
- Will do.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.579
Hey, Commander,
we got another issue.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.363
I downloaded
the Sentinel Guard app.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.757
A lot of users are praising Marc
for intervening today.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.542
Well, everybody
loves an underdog.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
Yeah, well, we're likely to have
a hell of a lot more of them.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.893
What are you talking about?

09:05.936 --> 09:07.895
The CEO of Sentinel Guard,
Vince Jones,

09:07.938 --> 09:10.462
just put a $100,000 bounty
out on our suspect.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.727
Oh, great. All right, look,
reach out to the CEO.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.381
If he's got this many users
interested in the case,

09:16.425 --> 09:18.427
maybe's he's got
some information we could use.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.696
You can say,
"I told you so"

09:26.740 --> 09:28.785
about me doing the
surgery for my mom,

09:28.829 --> 09:30.613
but I couldn't
live with myself

09:30.657 --> 09:32.876
if I hadn't given
her every chance.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.704
Even if she did
throw it all away.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.621
I really admired you
for doing that for her.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.493
It scared me that you were
putting yourself at risk,

09:41.537 --> 09:44.496
but I admired it.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.286
You need me, I'm here.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.942
I got to help Burrows dig

09:54.985 --> 09:57.466
through some new surveillance
footage, but, uh,

09:57.509 --> 10:00.077
tell that grumpy
Russian I said "Hi."

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
You got anything
with actual sugar,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.175
or is everyone here on some
juice butt cleanse from hell?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.699
Frank's burger joint

10:12.742 --> 10:14.091
is still open
if you're craving some grease.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.746
Best news I've had all day.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.446
Sanchez, you got a second?
It's about Street.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.666
Yeah, Hicks told me
about his mom.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.494
She sounds like a
real piece of work.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.365
Well, there's a lot of history
there, not much of it good.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.932
But that's why
I think it might be smart

10:28.976 --> 10:30.673
to let Street
take a couple days off.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.283
To process it all.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.068
Yeah? Well, Street says
he wants to keep rolling.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.504
He hasn't always had
the best judgement

10:35.547 --> 10:36.766
when it comes to his mom.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.115
Somebody might need to step in

10:38.159 --> 10:40.161
and help guide him.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.859
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think that's my place.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.295
Or yours.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.297
He's an adult, yeah?

10:46.341 --> 10:49.126
I'm just looking out
for a teammate.

10:51.128 --> 10:54.218
Yeah, I appreciate your concern,
but it's my call.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.307
I'm keeping him on.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.268
You want a burger
or fries? My treat.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.574
No, I'm good. Thanks.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.409
No, no, no. You tell Campos

11:11.453 --> 11:14.456
that if he wants to bet on
Cleveland, he pays his damn tab.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.284
Till then, I don't
want to hear it.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.242
How's business, Mikhal?

11:20.418 --> 11:22.594
Cops here to steal another one
of my son's prized possessions?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.858
Nope. Our bat hunting days
are over.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.729
Besides, your son got
a better end of that deal.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.818
- So what is it this time?
- We're looking for one

11:28.862 --> 11:30.733
of your associates,
- Tomas Hernandez.
- Not familiar.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.082
You sure? We hear
he's been placing bets

11:32.126 --> 11:33.867
with a bookie they
call "Russian Mike."

11:33.910 --> 11:35.129
Is there another Russian Mike

11:35.172 --> 11:37.087
- taking bets in town?
- I'm no bookie.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.743
I loaned Tomas 25 grand,
and now he's MIA.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.137
I want my money back.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.748
I'm sure Tomas knows you're
looking to recover your losses?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.881
With interest,
and he better hope you find him

11:47.924 --> 11:51.362
- before my people do.
- Unless you want to risk
an abetting charge,

11:51.406 --> 11:53.364
better call off your dogs.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.105
Can't stop what's already
set in motion.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.890
Hey, you're not the one
we're after,

11:56.933 --> 11:58.979
but if you want
that to change...

12:03.157 --> 12:05.115
He mentioned something about...

12:05.159 --> 12:06.726
needing the money
for his brother.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.294
That's all I got for you.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.042
Thank you.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.610
Vince Jones, I'm Sergeant
Kay, this is Off...

12:21.653 --> 12:23.917
Officer Luca.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.050
Come on. You're the star
of our top user post today.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.052
Thanks in part to you,
Sentinel moved

12:29.096 --> 12:30.967
across the one-million
user threshold this morning.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.795
This must be very
exciting new for you.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.318
Yeah, it's a big day for us.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.537
Well, then we won't take
too much of your time.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.060
We're hoping to
get all the data

12:37.104 --> 12:39.497
that your company's compiled
on Tomas Hernandez.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.630
Oh, our users are sending in
tons of tips on that case.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.588
They're very eager
to catch Tomas and his crew.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.634
Well, the police should be
- the ones catching them.
- Yeah.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.070
You should be,
but you're overworked,

12:47.114 --> 12:48.855
you're outnumbered,
you're underfunded.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.074
Sentinel Guard is designed
to help the police

12:51.118 --> 12:53.337
by using community resources
to solve crimes.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.339
It also encourages
untrained civilians to engage

12:55.383 --> 12:56.993
with armed and
dangerous suspects.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.778
- Or turn vigilante,
like this morning.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.302
Your user's actions
almost got a woman killed.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.956
We don't encourage
that kind of behavior.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.827
We ask that our users
only observe and report back

13:04.871 --> 13:06.481
to help you do your jobs better.

13:06.524 --> 13:10.354
Your $100,000 bounty
just now says otherwise.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.662
Tell me this. What do you think
would have happened

13:13.705 --> 13:16.752
to that woman this morning had
a Sentinel user not intervened?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.928
Maybe she might actually
be dead.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.325
Okay, well, if Sentinel Guard
is designed to help cops,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.153
why don't you give us
all the information

13:26.196 --> 13:28.851
that your users have collected
on Tomas Hernandez-- images,

13:28.895 --> 13:30.635
videos, all of it?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.334
Of course.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.031
I'll have my assistant
send over the data ASAP.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.686
- Thank you.
- All right.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.603
Heard you guys got Vince Jones
to cough up data

13:41.646 --> 13:43.039
from the Sentinel Guard app.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.780
Yeah, for what
that's worth.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.651
Apparently, the files just
came in-- all 900 of them.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.044
Hernandez's bookie mentioned

13:48.088 --> 13:49.959
that his debt might be
related to his brother.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.135
- Maybe that helps?
- Yeah, I'm looking into it.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.137
- Thanks.
- One other problem.
I just checked

13:54.181 --> 13:55.791
the applicants list
for this year's SWAT Academy.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.793
- There are zero women on it.
- I know.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.883
I know. I... I'm trying
- to figure that out.
- What do you mean?

14:00.927 --> 14:02.885
The female applicants that
we did have pulled themselves

14:02.929 --> 14:05.322
from consideration at the
last second, including Fowler.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.759
I thought
Fowler was training with Luca

14:07.803 --> 14:09.283
- for that exact purpose.
- Me, too.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.199
This came out of the blue.
I've asked Hicks

14:12.242 --> 14:14.288
to extend the application
window by 48 hours.

14:14.331 --> 14:17.682
I-I just don't know if that's
enough time for us to fix this.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.256
Whoa.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.736
What happened?

14:27.779 --> 14:29.346
I sprained my ankle
in SWAT Academy.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.393
That's why you pulled your name
from consideration?

14:32.436 --> 14:35.309
Sprains heal quickly,
and we can really use you here.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.224
No offense, but I wasn't even
sure you liked me, let alone

14:37.267 --> 14:39.835
wanted me on SWAT. Pretty sure
this is the longest conversation

14:39.879 --> 14:41.489
- we've ever had.
- When you joined,

14:41.532 --> 14:43.099
I was going through a lot.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.753
My friend died
right in front of me.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.103
It really spun me out.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.105
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.802
I should have been
more supportive.

14:50.846 --> 14:54.154
Truth is, SWAT needs
more women like you.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.636
I was interested,
but I decided

14:58.680 --> 15:00.464
not to take the risks
that come with trying out.

15:00.508 --> 15:03.032
- What do you mean?
- I took a closer look
at the SWAT training

15:03.076 --> 15:04.468
and fitness standards.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.948
Not only are they out of date,

15:05.992 --> 15:07.297
they're biased
in favor of male cadets.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.299
You've got the
skills and drive

15:09.343 --> 15:11.519
to get past all the
boys' club nonsense.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.608
This isn't a willpower issue.
It goes deeper than that.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.089
And I'm not the only
walking wounded.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.134
You know Officer Park,
North Hollywood Division?

15:18.178 --> 15:19.744
- Yeah.
- She tore her rotator cuff

15:19.788 --> 15:21.921
trying out for one
- of the SWAT PFQs.
- A cadet

15:21.964 --> 15:23.835
had the same thing happen
when I was training for SWAT.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.272
Let me guess-- female officer?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.013
Nicki Bradley.
How'd you know that?

15:27.056 --> 15:29.015
SWAT PFQs put a ton of emphasis
on explosive strength.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.625
Push-ups, pull-ups,

15:30.668 --> 15:33.497
box jumps... are all
exercises proven

15:33.541 --> 15:35.673
to put women at a
physiological disadvantage.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.632
Nicki was worried
about the push-up portion.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.982
She was training so hard
- for it, she got hurt.
- That makes sense.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.158
If you can't do 50 push-ups,
like most of the guys...

15:42.202 --> 15:43.855
- You don't make SWAT.
- Exactly.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.683
Male candidates are more
likely to succeed,

15:45.727 --> 15:48.121
and female candidates are more
likely to injure themselves

15:48.164 --> 15:50.601
trying to clear these
arbitrary fitness thresholds

15:50.645 --> 15:53.256
that have nothing to do
with actual SWAT work.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.345
Take a look at
the data yourself.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.957
The other female applicants
and I all talked.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.915
It doesn't seem worth it
to risk a whole career.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.656
What if we can change that?

16:01.699 --> 16:05.138
Good luck. In the meantime,
I got to watch my own six.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.928
I found a video from one

16:12.972 --> 16:14.669
of Tomas Hernandez's
earlier robberies

16:14.712 --> 16:16.584
in the Sentinel
files you got us.

16:16.627 --> 16:19.326
Footage was grainy, but it had
clear shots of his accomplices.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.241
Ran it through
facial rec, got a hit.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.894
Now, the other two
suspects are Jamie Mejia

16:22.938 --> 16:25.245
and Tomas's brother,
Danny Hernandez.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.637
Get that to Burrows.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.074
Hopefully, RHD can
dig up more intel on them.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.510
Danny's got a record
for aggravated assault,

16:29.553 --> 16:31.207
and a last known address
in Highland Park.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.122
Think all three of them
are hiding out there?

16:33.166 --> 16:35.429
It's the Sentinel
Guard app.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.910
Multiple users have spotted
Tomas Hernandez at an auto spa.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.608
- Where is it?
- Highland Park.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.436
That's only a few blocks
away from Danny's place.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.046
Let's go get 'em.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.405
This is the LAPD.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.538
Drop your weapons
and back away.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.671
I repeat-- weapons
down, back away.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.543
Deacon, Street,
Alonso, crowd duty.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.675
Get the civilians back
and keep 'em back.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.242
- Move, move, move, move!
- Move!

17:06.286 --> 17:07.374
- Everyone back.
- Let's go. Come on.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.679
I caught him-- Tomas Hernandez.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.072
He's locked in the store.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.552
You spotted him? Hell, no!
I posted it first.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.510
- It's my 100 grand!
- Get out!

17:13.554 --> 17:15.034
That way, go!

17:15.077 --> 17:16.165
Go!

17:16.209 --> 17:17.732
Get out of the way!

17:17.775 --> 17:19.125
Where's the staff?

17:19.168 --> 17:20.735
27-David, be advised.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.432
Suspect may have
hostages inside.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.999
- We need to get eyes in there.
- Roger.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.349
Luca, Tan, let's move.

17:28.525 --> 17:29.918
Deac, you three hit it

17:29.961 --> 17:32.007
from the garage.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.677
25-David.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.113
I see one suspect inside

17:51.157 --> 17:52.114
huddled in the two-three corner.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.115
Any hostages?

17:53.159 --> 17:54.464
Can't get a clear visual.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.336
I'll try to engage.
Cover the exit.

17:56.379 --> 17:59.252
Tomas Hernandez,
this is LAPD SWAT.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.254
Come out with your hands
above your head.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.128
27-David. Off perimeter position
to speak to a possible witness.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.308
Ma'am, I'm Sergeant
Harrelson, LAPD SWAT.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.049
Prep the tear gas.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.747
On my count.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.880
I don't know what happened.
One minute, I was selling Peter

18:18.923 --> 18:22.318
a Gatorade and the next, this
mob came and trapped him inside.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.103
You said the man's name
inside is Peter?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.235
He buys a yellow Gatorade
with his car wash every Friday.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.585
- Three, two, one.
- Get to safety now. Sanchez, no!

18:28.629 --> 18:30.283
Deploy gas.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.988
Down on your knees.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.642
- Now!
- Now! On the ground!

18:41.685 --> 18:42.991
- Give me your hands
behind your back.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.253
- Clear!

18:46.995 --> 18:48.997
27-David.
This man is not our suspect.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.303
Suspect's still in the wind.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.652
What do you mean, "in the wind?"

18:51.695 --> 18:53.175
Tomas Hernandez was never here.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.308
Sentinel got it wrong.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.184
We've got unis sitting outside
Danny Hernandez's house

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
in Highland Park.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.841
No sign of the real suspects.
That's not all.

19:06.884 --> 19:10.149
The guy we gassed-- he's a third
grade teacher with no priors.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.194
Lawsuits, here we come.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
Yeah, unlucky for him,
he looks like Hernandez.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.893
It's confirmation
bias at work.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.982
And if Sentinel keeps up
this bounty,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.420
we'll keep getting
misleading intel, more mistakes.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.204
Working on that.
Just talked

19:22.248 --> 19:24.772
to the Sentinel Guard CEO,
Vince Jones.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.165
Tried to get him
to kill the bounty.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.557
- Any luck?
- We'll see.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.211
As Jones kindly reminded me,

19:29.255 --> 19:30.734
Sentinel's a private business,

19:30.778 --> 19:32.997
and LAPD lacks the authority
to dictate terms.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.087
Great. Meanwhile, the LAPD
tip hotline gets overwhelmed

19:36.131 --> 19:37.654
with people chasing
the reward money.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.874
I mean, they're averaging
a call per minute.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.267
With that much info coming in,
we can't differentiate

19:41.310 --> 19:42.833
- between fact and fiction.
- Right.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.183
And it's only getting worse.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.141
Jones just doubled the bounty
to 200K.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.492
Son of a bitch. He and his app
are gonna get someone killed.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.668
Well, luckily, Burrows
and RHD made some headway.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.410
They did a deep dive on the
Hernandez brothers' financials.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.759
Turns out Danny Hernandez

19:55.803 --> 19:57.413
has some significant
debts of his own.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.241
- He's a gambler, too?
- Not unless
you can bet on doctors.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
Most of these are
hospital bills, pharmacy bills,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.898
and regular payments
to a Victoria Bayon.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.465
What's her connection
to Danny and Tomas Hernandez?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.902
Find out.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.173
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.044
How you doing, kid?

20:20.088 --> 20:22.438
Oh, I got a little of that
tear gas in my eye earlier,

20:22.482 --> 20:24.484
but... I'll be fine.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.877
I was talking
about your mom.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.926
I'm fine, really.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.494
I know I wouldn't be fine.

20:34.537 --> 20:39.325
Well, that's 'cause
your mom's pretty great.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.501
Hey, don't you think
it would be better

20:41.544 --> 20:43.590
if you took
a little time off?

20:45.679 --> 20:49.291
Maybe just drop out,
take a quick trip to Mexico?

20:49.335 --> 20:51.989
I'm just offering
my condolences.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.257
Hey.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.608
I'm here because
I care about you.

21:01.651 --> 21:05.220
No, you're here because
it's convenient for you.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.744
Now, you preach all day

21:07.788 --> 21:10.443
about SWAT being a family.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.314
- SWAT is a family.
- But you don't ignore family.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.317
I knew I couldn't count
on my mom,

21:15.361 --> 21:17.667
but I always thought
that I could count on you.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.452
But where were you?

21:19.495 --> 21:21.932
When I was laid up in a
hospital bed, where were you?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.847
Or when we were all texting you
and calling you

21:23.891 --> 21:26.763
for weeks on end
with no response?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.983
Street, I had some pretty
heavy stuff going on myself.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.768
But look, I am sorry... Hondo, if we're
friends, real friends,

21:31.812 --> 21:35.685
you don't get to just pick and
choose when you show up for us.

21:38.209 --> 21:41.387
I've had enough people
in my life do that already.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.184
I guess I wasn't clear
enough earlier.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.057
Leave Street alone.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.670
That is an order.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.287
<i>Talked to Fowler</i>

22:12.331 --> 22:13.767
and found out why
she pulled her name.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.682
She said SWAT's physical
training standards

22:15.725 --> 22:18.119
are flawed
- and biased against women.
- She say anything else?

22:18.162 --> 22:20.164
Too much emphasis on
explosive strength exercises,

22:20.208 --> 22:22.776
none of which actually predict
performance in the field.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.778
Hey, I-I'd like to hear more
on this from Fowler,

22:24.821 --> 22:26.780
but she's not wrong.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.435
How do we change it?

22:29.478 --> 22:31.219
Expand the qualifying
categories in the PFQ.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.787
Rather than make cadets
do 60 push-ups,

22:33.830 --> 22:35.136
give them the option
of bench press,

22:35.179 --> 22:36.311
barbells or
something like that.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.791
Look, I'm all for improving

22:37.834 --> 22:39.836
and expanding our training
and recruitment,

22:39.880 --> 22:41.403
but let's be honest.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.666
We can't just simply lower
the bar for female officers.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.146
I've never had to get
into a push-up contest

22:45.189 --> 22:46.713
with a suspect
before. Have you?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.367
No.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.196
I've been one of the few
female SWAT officers here

22:52.240 --> 22:55.939
for years, Deac, and-and... and
there's something clearly broken

22:55.983 --> 22:58.115
in our recruiting process.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.074
It's about time we fix it.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.732
- Victoria Bayon?
- They said to come in
immediately.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.473
Is something wrong?

23:07.516 --> 23:08.996
We just need to
talk for a bit.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.259
- Who's this little one?
- My daughter, Sammi.

23:11.302 --> 23:14.393
I didn't have time to call
a sitter on short notice.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.220
<i>Mamita,</i> take Mommy's phone

23:16.264 --> 23:18.571
and go and play for
a few minutes, okay?

23:18.614 --> 23:20.573
We need to ask you
about your relationship

23:20.616 --> 23:22.096
with Danny Hernandez.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.532
We know he regularly
sends you money.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.013
- Is that against the law?
- Maybe.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.754
Danny's a suspect
in a string of armed robberies,

23:27.797 --> 23:29.059
along with
Jamie Mejia...

23:29.103 --> 23:31.192
And Danny's brother Tomas.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.759
You knew about
- the robberies?
- No.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.501
But if Danny's hanging
around Tomas...

23:35.544 --> 23:38.547
Danny's my ex
and Sammi's father.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.723
We broke up last year,

23:40.767 --> 23:42.377
but he's been good to Sammi.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.683
Lately, he started

23:43.726 --> 23:46.163
buying her things,
sending money for bills.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.904
It sounds like Danny's heart's
in the right place.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.864
Danny's selfish,
always has been.

23:50.907 --> 23:53.344
I thought he'd turned a corner,
but if he's hanging around

23:53.388 --> 23:55.825
his loser brother,
there's no hope for him.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.220
Can you give me a minute?

23:59.263 --> 24:00.830
My daughter needs her insulin.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.180
- Sammi's diabetic?
- Type 1.

24:03.224 --> 24:06.314
Danny's been helping
to pay for her prescriptions

24:06.357 --> 24:08.838
and medical bills
since it's so expensive.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.711
Now that I know where
the money is coming from,

24:11.754 --> 24:13.452
I won't take it.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.888
Means I'll just have
to figure out

24:14.931 --> 24:18.457
some other way of paying for it.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.199
<i>Hey, it turns out,</i>

24:22.243 --> 24:24.463
Serena, the homeowner
who was shot this morning,

24:24.506 --> 24:27.944
is also a diabetic and a regular
customer at Leavitt's Pharmacy.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.164
Now, according to the
pharmacy's sales records,

24:30.207 --> 24:32.253
Serena bought the last of
their insulin stock yesterday

24:32.296 --> 24:34.081
right before this
crew hit 'em.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.865
That's why they robbed
both Serena and the pharmacy.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.432
They were after the insulin.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.955
That stuff's
like liquid gold these days.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.480
My buddy's a diabetic.
He said his insulin goes

24:41.523 --> 24:43.525
for 300 bucks a vial--
that's with insurance.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.005
Yeah, means there's
a huge demand

24:45.048 --> 24:46.833
for it on the
black market.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.400
And plenty of profit for guys
like Danny, Tomas and Jamie.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.620
Multiple Sentinel users
spotted Jamie Mejia's SUV

24:51.664 --> 24:53.100
on the move in East L.A.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.493
We're gonna fall
for that again?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.929
No, they're on
to something this time.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.061
Okay, license plates
are a match.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.629
All right, roll out.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.549
Go, go, go.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.420
Hey, you. Out! Now. Get out!

25:10.944 --> 25:12.423
Come on, let's go.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.687
Get down, right
there. Don't move.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.215
There's no insulin here.

25:22.259 --> 25:23.696
- Where's the insulin?
- I already delivered it.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.132
- You can check the log and see.
- Where?!

25:25.175 --> 25:26.829
- On the dash.
- Grab whatever looks expensive.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.135
This crap's got
to be worth something.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.572
Please. I can get in
lots of...

25:33.967 --> 25:35.795
Let's go!

25:37.100 --> 25:38.406
Ah, yo! Pop the trunk.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.539
Pop the trunk! Aah!

25:42.323 --> 25:43.629
Luca, Tan,

25:43.672 --> 25:44.673
stay with Hernandez.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.675
Got it, Deac.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.772
24-David.
Pursuing suspect

25:56.816 --> 25:58.034
southbound on foot!

26:05.912 --> 26:07.261
Don't move, Jamie.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.756
This guy's driving crazy.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.985
Hey!

26:36.029 --> 26:37.813
Go around it! Go around.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.033
I can't. I can't.
We're pinned in.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.389
22-David to Command. Lost sight
of the suspect's vehicle,

26:48.432 --> 26:50.043
headed north
on Fifth Street.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.312
Jamie Mejia isn't talking,

26:58.355 --> 27:00.401
so I hope you got something
from the driver they attacked.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.185
CEK Medical Supply is
the largest distributor

27:02.229 --> 27:03.665
of insulin in the L.A. area.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.624
Now, the van was empty
when they hit it,

27:05.667 --> 27:07.234
but the driver said that Danny
made off with the delivery log.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.757
They're still after the insulin.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.759
I had the company send us
all the delivery options

27:10.803 --> 27:12.500
for the last 24 hours. Tan?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.458
That van made almost a dozen
insulin deliveries today,

27:14.502 --> 27:16.635
- all over L.A.
- Highlight the three
biggest deliveries.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.202
One insulin drop at a hospital,
one in a nursing home,

27:19.246 --> 27:20.943
and one at a major
shipping depot.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.989
Yeah, it looks like the shipping
depot got the largest supply.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.686
Almost a dozen boxes.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.470
It's also got the fewest
workers and softest security.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.603
All right, let's gear up
and roll out.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.083
Where's Hondo?

27:30.126 --> 27:31.911
I had him hang back
at Victoria Bayon's house

27:31.954 --> 27:33.564
in case
the bad guys pop up there.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.741
Don't you think
we could use him?

27:35.784 --> 27:39.483
Sure. Give him a call,
have him meet us there.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.936
Hey, Sentinel Guards,

27:56.979 --> 27:58.764
I think I see those suspects
everyone's been looking for

27:58.807 --> 28:01.070
here in East L.A.
I'm gonna follow 'em.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.376
Stay tuned.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.994
20-David to Command.
We're making entrance

28:12.038 --> 28:13.213
at the shipping depot.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.736
Hondo, Street,
Luca, with me.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.259
The rest of you on Deacon.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.044
Watch for civilians
and hostages as we clear.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.393
Let's roll.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.758
Get out of here,
leave the building. Move.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.717
Look out.
Other side.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.724
Let's go.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.464
I need you to quietly exit.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.642
Insulin has
to be refrigerated.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.732
Plans say there's
cold storage in the back.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.616
Tomas Hernandez! LAPD!

29:08.659 --> 29:09.878
30-David,
in pursuit of one suspect

29:09.922 --> 29:11.227
in the west end of
the building.

29:25.415 --> 29:26.852
Clear.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.942
Chris, Tan.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.562
Tomas! LAPD.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.141
Going hands on.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.056
30-David,
one suspect in custody.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.284
I got movement!

30:09.895 --> 30:11.810
Luca, Hondo, stay with him.
Street, with me.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.472
Sorry, folks, time for me to go.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.607
Whoa, whoa.

30:27.913 --> 30:31.307
Danny, drop the
weapon. Drop it.

30:35.616 --> 30:38.184
Move one step closer
and dude is dead.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.144
Street, get up
that ladder and line up a shot.

30:42.188 --> 30:45.582
I am not risking another
innocent life today.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.280
Luca, see if

30:47.323 --> 30:48.847
you can get behind Danny.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.327
Hondo, keep him busy

30:51.371 --> 30:52.851
while Street and Luca get
into position.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.243
I have you covered.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.636
Danny, listen.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.594
If you shoot him,
we got to shoot you,

30:57.638 --> 30:58.769
and nobody wants
that, right?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.032
Nobody has to get hurt.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.077
Just let me
take the insulin and go.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.471
I know about your daughter.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.429
And there are other ways
to take care of her.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.431
Legal ways.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.566
26-David, at the next
available opportunity,

31:12.609 --> 31:13.959
take the shot.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.050
I told you, one more step...

31:18.093 --> 31:19.703
26-David.
Trying to get a visual now.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.183
I'm trying to help you.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.184
Hondo, stand down.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.186
We're ending this now.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.449
Hondo, I need you
two steps to your left.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.800
Damn it, Hondo.

31:29.844 --> 31:30.889
Move to your left,

31:30.932 --> 31:32.238
that's an order.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.066
26-David.
I lost the shot.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.894
Danny, you got
to keep talking to me.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.896
That's the only way we're both
walking out of here alive.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.427
Hondo, I repeat, stand down.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.776
What's your name, son?

31:48.819 --> 31:50.604
- Uh, Mitch.
- Do you have any kids, Mitch?

31:50.647 --> 31:52.519
A daughter.
Just turned one.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.955
Shut up!

31:53.999 --> 31:55.043
Come on,
Danny, you heard that.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.001
Mitch has a little girl at home

31:56.044 --> 31:57.480
he's trying to get to.

31:57.524 --> 31:58.568
You know what that's like,
I know you do.

31:58.612 --> 31:59.656
You and Mitchdeserve

31:59.700 --> 32:00.875
to get home to your daughters.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.094
I know you want
to see Sammi again.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.704
22-David.
I got him

32:03.747 --> 32:05.184
- in my sights.
- Danny, we don't have much time.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.142
I need you to put
that gun down,

32:07.186 --> 32:09.362
- let Mitch go.
- Take the shot, Luca.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.103
Damn it,
put the gun down!

32:11.146 --> 32:12.234
Now!

32:12.278 --> 32:13.583
Put it down.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.117
Move.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.206
On your knees,
get on your knees.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.817
Hands behind your head!

32:34.778 --> 32:35.736
20-David
to Command.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.520
We're Code 4.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.131
Final suspect
in custody.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.840
Hey, Street.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.885
Hold up.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.977
What's up?

32:59.020 --> 33:00.021
First,

33:00.065 --> 33:01.980
I'm sorry about your mom.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.244
And I'm sorry about
the other stuff, too.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.897
I thought
isolating myself

33:06.941 --> 33:09.248
down in Mexico would
let me clear my head

33:09.291 --> 33:10.858
and work through everything
I had going on

33:10.901 --> 33:12.773
and not let me be a bother
to the rest of you,

33:12.816 --> 33:14.862
but that does not excuse me

33:14.905 --> 33:16.168
from leaving you all
in the dark.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.866
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.478
I may not have
been here then,

33:22.522 --> 33:24.263
but I'm standing
here right now.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.134
So if you need to
talk about anything,

33:26.178 --> 33:28.049
you want to
grab a beer...

33:28.093 --> 33:31.444
I think I'm just gonna
head home, unwind,

33:31.487 --> 33:34.447
but...
I appreciate it.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.057
Yeah.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.683
Hey.
Hey.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.120
Heard a rumor someone
was spearheading

33:55.163 --> 33:56.773
some long overdue changes
to SWAT training.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.427
Well, I felt like it was time.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.429
Deacon's working to modernize
parts of the program

34:00.473 --> 34:01.822
as we speak.

34:01.865 --> 34:02.866
Thinking about
resubmitting your name

34:02.910 --> 34:04.346
for consideration?

34:04.390 --> 34:06.218
Told the commander,
soon as I'm healed up.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.002
I know a few of the other women
already resubmitted as well.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.830
That's what I
like to hear.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.664
Chris.

34:17.707 --> 34:20.058
You didn't have to do that.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.496
Thanks.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.809
Sergeant Kay, it's so good
to see you again.

34:32.853 --> 34:33.810
And you are?

34:33.854 --> 34:34.942
Officer Tan.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.422
Your app kept us
real busy today.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.597
How can we help you,
Mr. Jones?

34:37.640 --> 34:38.641
Well, our users
want to see

34:38.685 --> 34:40.339
the real heroes responsible

34:40.382 --> 34:41.949
for taking down
Tomas and Danny Hernandez,

34:41.992 --> 34:43.342
as well as saving

34:43.385 --> 34:44.691
our loyal Sentinel Guard
user Mitch Cartwright.

34:44.734 --> 34:45.996
Wait a second,
you're filming this?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.824
Yeah, we're livestreaming
to our users.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.130
Okay, well,
we're-we're not interested,

34:49.174 --> 34:50.479
but, uh, have a nice day.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.133
Wait, you said
you're livestreaming?

34:52.177 --> 34:54.527
Yeah, we got about 20,000
or so watching right now.

34:54.570 --> 34:55.745
Well, then, we should give
a shout-out to the real hero

34:55.789 --> 34:57.051
in all of this.
Not SWAT.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.314
It was, uh, Victoria Bayon.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.838
That's right.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.188
I mean, it was Victoria's
tips that lead us

35:03.231 --> 35:04.624
directly to the
Hernandez brothers.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.495
So I guess
she's entitled to the bounty

35:06.539 --> 35:08.497
that you
- so generously offered.
- Well, I think she needs

35:08.541 --> 35:10.543
to be a Sentinel Guard user
to claim the bounty...

35:10.586 --> 35:11.935
Mm, I don't think so.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.981
Last I checked,
anyone with information

35:14.024 --> 35:16.549
that lead to the suspects'
apprehension was eligible.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.159
Huh.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.205
Well, she'll be grateful
to receive the cash reward.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.207
Of course. Thank you, Officers.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.425
Thanks so much.

35:23.469 --> 35:24.861
Quick thinking.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.689
Well, someone's got to pay
for Sammi's insulin.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.300
Might as well be Jones,
right?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.800
Hey. Come on in.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.591
Luca went to grab beers
with Deac.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.420
I wasn't really
in the mood.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.859
What are you feeling
right now?

36:06.903 --> 36:07.861
Anger.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.168
Sadness.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.343
Regret.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.648
You name it.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.737
I'd say that's all
pretty normal.

36:14.781 --> 36:15.956
Normal?

36:18.132 --> 36:20.526
There was nothing normal
about my relationship with her.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.793
Is it wrong that...

36:29.099 --> 36:32.320
I feel a little relieved?

36:32.364 --> 36:33.800
No.

36:33.843 --> 36:37.195
I felt a little relieved,
too, when my mom died.

36:38.674 --> 36:43.244
All her drinking,
her outbursts...

36:43.288 --> 36:46.160
It was like a weight
lifted off my shoulders

36:46.204 --> 36:49.250
when that whole part
of my life went away.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.644
You spend
all this time

36:51.687 --> 36:54.255
loving a deeply flawed person,

36:54.299 --> 36:56.431
praying and hoping
they'll change...

36:56.475 --> 36:57.824
And they never do.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.565
Yeah.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.004
I always dreaded this day.

37:04.047 --> 37:07.660
Not just because... she's gone,

37:07.703 --> 37:10.445
but because...

37:10.489 --> 37:12.752
I knew when she died

37:12.795 --> 37:15.581
I'd really and truly be alone.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.670
You're not alone.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.765
What are you doing here?

37:25.808 --> 37:27.680
- What do you mean?
- I can't keep doing

37:27.723 --> 37:29.464
this weird half-relationship
thing we're doing.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.119
You burrow into my head
and into my heart,

37:32.162 --> 37:33.686
but I can't touch you.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.557
I can't kiss you.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.298
Do you realize
how screwed up that is?

37:37.342 --> 37:39.257
You know we can't
be together right now.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.868
I would never ask you
to compromise yourself at work.

37:41.911 --> 37:44.044
But I can't
keep doing...

37:45.654 --> 37:47.569
...whatever this is.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.228
I can't.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.849
You wanted to see me,
Commander?

38:07.850 --> 38:10.505
Sergeant Sanchez claims
you disobeyed a direct order

38:10.549 --> 38:12.246
in the field today.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.508
- Is that true?
- It was a judgement call

38:13.552 --> 38:15.118
from a different
vantage point

38:15.162 --> 38:16.598
than the team leader.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.600
I was trying to save lives,
not end them.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.733
A yes or no answer would make
this all go faster, Hondo.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.172
We completed the mission,

38:25.215 --> 38:26.565
arrested the suspects
without incident.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.131
No thanks to
your insubordination.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.437
I'll be the judge of that.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.134
Maybe not this time.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.703
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

38:34.747 --> 38:36.488
It means he's gunning
for me, Commander.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.447
I know about your orders
with the commission.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.884
He's trying to
get me to quit

38:41.928 --> 38:43.756
as payback for being
a whistleblower.

38:43.799 --> 38:46.324
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:46.367 --> 38:48.195
What'd you expect, Hondo?

38:48.238 --> 38:49.892
You embarrassed them

38:49.936 --> 38:51.938
and these are men that
don't like being embarrassed.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.896
What the hell is going on here?

38:53.940 --> 38:56.899
Look, I actually like
all of you.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.814
I'm glad this is all
out in the open now.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.034
Didn't feel right,
working this behind your back.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.470
You're a real son of
a bitch, aren't you?

39:02.514 --> 39:03.471
Why do you even
want to deal

39:03.515 --> 39:05.386
with all the stress, Hondo?

39:05.430 --> 39:06.996
All the pushback
from the department.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.520
Just go.

39:08.563 --> 39:09.782
Leave SWAT
in your rearview.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.218
SWAT is where I belong.

39:11.261 --> 39:12.741
Well, the brass wants you out.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.003
You can go easy,
you can go hard.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.396
That's not your call to make.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.398
I am not the architect
of this plan.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.052
I'm just the tool.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.575
You know what? You're
damn right, you are a tool.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.142
You are a brown man

39:22.185 --> 39:23.926
coming after a Black man
for calling out racist cops.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.450
That don't make
no kind of sense.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.103
This has nothing to do
with race.
No?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.409
- What's it about, then?
- You are a cop

39:28.453 --> 39:29.802
who went outside
the chain of command.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.717
Now they're gonna use you
to make an example

39:31.760 --> 39:33.283
for everyone to witness.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.894
Talking of chain of command,

39:34.937 --> 39:36.678
it says "Commander Hicks"
on that door.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.114
Not "Sanchez."

39:38.158 --> 39:39.899
Stay in your lane.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.250
If it wasn't me,

39:43.293 --> 39:44.860
they would just
send somebody else.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.471
They can send you

39:46.514 --> 39:49.299
and a dozen more yes-man
kiss-ass sellouts just like you,

39:49.343 --> 39:51.214
and I will keep doing my job.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.347
And I'll just keep writing you
up for insubordination.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.131
I won't sign off on that.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.916
I don't think that's gonna
matter much to the higher-ups.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.441
See, 'cause all it's gonna take
is one minor screwup

40:00.485 --> 40:03.401
to give the commission what
it wants to send you packing.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.534
So have some dignity

40:06.578 --> 40:08.928
and just walk away first.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.279
For your own good.

40:12.322 --> 40:16.370
Until then, I expect you to
follow every order I give you.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.503
To the letter.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.768
Commander.
