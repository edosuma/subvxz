  <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:09.809

01:15.075 --> 01:17.477
  ( doorbell rings )

01:18.278 --> 01:20.547
Coming.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.218
 Hey, Screech.
 l cannot believe your parents

01:25.251 --> 01:27.654
 are really leaving us
 with the house for four days.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.723
It's a dream come true.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.660
Really? I usually dream
that I'm on
"Gilligan's Island"...

01:35.228 --> 01:40.600
 surrounded by beautiful girls,
 but none of them talk to me.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.004
  Let me tell you, that's not
  a dream, that's your life.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.805
   ( horn honking )

01:45.839 --> 01:48.108
  Mom, hurry up!
  Dad's freaking out!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.976
  Woman: I'm coming!

01:52.278 --> 01:55.281
Oh, oh! Zachary, be careful
with the King!

01:55.315 --> 01:57.717
  Elvis is not a toy.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.887
   I'd just die if anything
   happened to it.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.922
   Mrs. Powers,
   I hope you and Mr. Powers

02:02.956 --> 02:04.891
   have a wonderful
   anniversary at Graceland.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.560
  - Where are you staying?
  - Heartbreak Hotel.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.062
  Where else?

02:09.062 --> 02:12.165
 Don't worry about a thing.
 Just enjoy yourself.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.900
  Thank you, Zachary.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.837
I'm just so glad my Samuel
has a friend as trustworthy
  as you.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.272
   Zack: Thank you.

02:19.305 --> 02:23.276
  Well, bye, Mom. Don't forget
  my Elvis slippers, size 11.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.613
 My little man is all grown up.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.186
   ( horn honking )

02:33.219 --> 02:35.789
  I almost forgot! Hound Dog.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.158
 ( whistles )

02:38.191 --> 02:42.095
Mommy almost left
without saying goodbye.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.798
 Now, I want you boys
 to have fun.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.199
   Oh yeah, one more thing,

02:46.232 --> 02:48.301
   here are
   a few little house rules.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.736
  All right.

02:54.874 --> 02:57.877
  But rule 136 says no girls.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.946
Rule 137 says no party.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.348
- Screech...
- Just leave him alone.

03:01.381 --> 03:05.051
 So we can't have a party,
 big deal. But we can
 still have some fun.

03:05.085 --> 03:08.054
 We'll do, you know, guy stuff.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.190
 Yeah, it'll be great!

03:10.223 --> 03:13.326
 We'll rip phone books in two,
 and burp as loud as we want!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.695
There you go, Screech!

03:15.729 --> 03:18.064
Hi, guys. Let's all go
to the movies tonight.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.900
 Sorry, girls.
 It's guys' night in.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.103
  Yup, men doing men things.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.072
   And no-ooo babes!

03:26.072 --> 03:29.109
  Well, excu-use us.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.913
   Oh no, guys,
   Violet just waved at me!

03:33.947 --> 03:37.183
- What do I do?!
- Hey, here she comes.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.387
  Stop drooling,
  you don't want her to slip.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.789
  Hi, Samuel.

03:42.822 --> 03:46.960
 I really enjoyed
 your presentation
 in biology yesterday.

03:46.993 --> 03:51.831
  Well, I've always loved
  the mating habits of worms.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.834
  Goodness gracious, Samuel!

03:54.868 --> 03:58.104
   Are you all right there?

03:58.104 --> 04:01.641
Violet Ann Bickerstaff!

04:04.277 --> 04:06.046
  Hi, Maxwell. I was just...

04:06.046 --> 04:08.648
 I buy this you gold-plated
 pocket protector

04:08.682 --> 04:11.117
  and I find you conversing
  with another man?

04:11.151 --> 04:13.820
 Screech, I think Violet
 has the hots for you.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.355
Why would she want me?

04:15.388 --> 04:20.160
 She's dating the richest,
 most powerful dork at Bayside.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.063
And the biggest creep,
the way he treats her.

04:23.063 --> 04:27.067
   - Yeah.
   - Just remember
   you're my squaw,

04:27.067 --> 04:31.071
 and that means you don't
 talk to any hunk but me, huh?

04:37.744 --> 04:39.946
  Gee, if she were my girl,
  I'd let her talk

04:39.979 --> 04:41.981
to any geek
she wanted to.

04:43.717 --> 04:47.120
 All right, Maxwell, you listen
 and you listen good.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.922
   Violet is a woman

04:48.955 --> 04:51.424
  and deserves
  to be treated with respect.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.295
I know exactly
what you need.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.035
 You tell him, honey.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.238
  Guess what?

05:05.271 --> 05:07.340
 Violet broke up with Maxwell.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.242
  Yeah, I just dumped
  the dweeb.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.945
   I was tired of being treated
   as a nerd ornament.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.049
  Well, good for you.
  You deserve someone better.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.752
   Someone like,
   hey, what about Screech?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.954
   You mean, Samuel Powers?

05:21.054 --> 05:25.191
  Oh, he's so dreamy.

05:25.225 --> 05:29.229
  But why would he want me?
  He could have
  any girl he wants.

05:29.262 --> 05:33.466
 We have just entered
 "The Twilight Zone."

05:33.500 --> 05:36.202
Violet, why don't you come
to the movies with us?

05:36.236 --> 05:39.739
Yeah, and if we hurry,
we can all catch
the 8:00 show.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.942
 I'd rather find out what Zack,
 Screech, and Slater are up to.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.944
 They said they were
 gonna do men things,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.312
 whatever that means.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.381
   My brothers see
   who can burp the loudest.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.817
My youngest brother
can say his full name,

05:50.850 --> 05:54.387
Kenny Leonard Kapowski,
in one burp.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.456
 ( snorting )

06:01.027 --> 06:04.731
You know, I'd love
to know what guys do
when we're not around.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.367
 You mean,
 besides talking
 about babes?

06:10.470 --> 06:13.139
  Are you thinking
  what I'm thinking?

06:21.881 --> 06:24.784
   ( lip-synching )
  <i>* Ba-Ba-Ba, Ba-Barbara Ann</i>

06:24.818 --> 06:27.554

06:53.380 --> 06:55.915
 ( cheering )

06:55.949 --> 06:59.819
 - What are you
 guys doing here?
 - Watching you dance, bubba.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.222
  Come on, you guys got
  to get out of here.

07:02.255 --> 07:06.826
 Hi, Samuel.
 I really loved your dancing.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.863
  Yes, we loved
  how you all moved.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.297
- Oh, yes.
- Right, girls?

07:11.331 --> 07:12.532
 <i>* Ba-Ba-Ba, Ba-Barbara Ann *</i>

07:12.565 --> 07:14.034
 Screech: Come on, watch out.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.269
  <i>* Ba-Ba-Ba,</i>
  <i>Ba-Barbara Ann... *</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:21.107
  Looks like
  the King is dead...

07:21.141 --> 07:24.044
  - ( guitar strums )
  - ...again.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.121
   Hey, come on,
   Screech, wake up.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.824
Come on, Screech,
it's just
a stupid Elvis statue.

07:37.857 --> 07:41.528
 - How important could that be?
 - Lisa, you don't understand.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.498
My mom said she'd die
if anything ever
happened to it.

07:56.409 --> 08:01.348
  - Hello, Samuel.
  - Mom, you're back.

08:01.381 --> 08:05.552
 So,
 what's different about you?
 Did you shave your eyebrows?

08:05.585 --> 08:09.022
 I told you I'd die if anything
 happened to my Elvis statue.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.827
   When the King hit the floor,
   I bit the big one.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.529
   It was an accident, Mom.
   I'm sorry.

08:16.563 --> 08:19.432
I forgive you, Samuel.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.702
   But now your gonna
   have to apologize to him.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.846
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.

08:32.879 --> 08:36.049
   Is this the boy
   who got you all
   shook up, uh-huh?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.486
  Now, Elvis, don't be cruel.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.822
 I forgive you, little fella,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.058
   but the damage
   is already done.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.626
  We gotta be
  going now, Roberta.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.962
 I'm giving
 a concert for my mama
 at the Pearly Gates.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.599
I'm singing live, if you'll
pardon the expression.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.068
 Both: Uh-huh.

08:55.068 --> 09:00.006
 Goodbye, Samuel.
 And say goodbye to Hound Dog.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.681
I'm sorry, Mom.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.883
  It was an accident.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.788
 - It was an accident.
 - Screech,
 come on, don't worry.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.524
- We'll get another statue.
- Yeah, right.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.493
   Where are we
   gonna buy another one
   before my mom gets home?

09:20.527 --> 09:24.030
   Honey, if it's for sale,
   I'll find it.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.102
   Samuel, I'm truly sorry
   about last night,

09:29.135 --> 09:33.039
  and I'll
  understand if you never
  want to speak to me again.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.874
 It wasn't your fault, Violet.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.077
That's so sweet of you!

09:37.110 --> 09:39.746
 ( snorting )

09:39.779 --> 09:41.915
You're not like
Maxwell at all.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.850
   I'm so glad we broke up.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.852
You broke up?!

09:45.885 --> 09:49.522
 I mean, gee, too bad.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.759
 Lisa's the name,
 shopping's the game.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.729
 - Please, no applause.
 - She found the Elvis statue!

09:55.762 --> 09:57.931
  Great! Where is it?

09:57.964 --> 10:01.134
  Still in the store.
  It costs 250 bucks.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.770
   Where are we gonna
   get $250?

10:03.803 --> 10:06.106
   We need to find
   somebody rich and quick.

10:08.241 --> 10:12.912
Violet Ann Bickerstaff!

10:12.946 --> 10:17.050
Snap all you want, Maxwell.
I... I am no
longer your possession.

10:17.083 --> 10:21.821
   You blew it, babe.
   Don't try crawling back.

10:23.256 --> 10:27.260
  Ohh! I wish someone would
  teach him a lesson.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.829
 We're gonna teach him
 a lesson, all right.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.732
A $250 lesson.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.836
 Ladies and gentlemen,

10:36.870 --> 10:40.340
  the name of the game
  is Five-card Stud.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.643
Some say
they named it after me.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.579
 Hey, Maxwell, are you sure
 you've never
 played poker before?

10:46.613 --> 10:50.150
Well, maybe once
or twice with my mommy.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.955
  Full house,

10:55.989 --> 10:57.857
  read 'em and weep.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.125
 What?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
 You're too hot, Nerdstrom.
 I'm out.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.762
   Me, too.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.832
   Well, here's a buck, babe,
   just for being beautiful.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.970
 And here's a dirty look
 just for being alive.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.772
  ( Hound Dog barks )

11:12.806 --> 11:14.941
   Sounds like Hound Dog
   wants to come in.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.578
I'll go with you,
I love animals.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.081
  Obviously.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.651
 Zack, you can stop
 letting him win now.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.252
Who's letting him win?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.588
 Why don't you just
 give him your money?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.091
 Yeah, it'd be a lot quicker.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.396
  All: Ohhh.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.299
  - I'll bet 10 bucks, Maxwell.
  - But that's all
  the money you have.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.268
Hey, hey, hey.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.170
 There we go.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
   I'll see your 10,

11:46.239 --> 11:48.641
   and raise you 50.

11:48.675 --> 11:52.645
Guys, I need something
worth 50 bucks.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.351
  He's almost as cute
  as you are.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.387
 They say owners
 resemble their dogs.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.389
 Why don't you
 bet the mutt, Morris?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.258
 - He can't bet Hound Dog!
 - Screech, it's a sure thing.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.393
He can't lose.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.061
  Are you guys sure?

12:09.829 --> 12:12.298
  - Okay, Zack. Do it.
  - Okay, Nerdstrom,

12:12.332 --> 12:15.669
  but the dog is worth
  more than 50 bucks.

12:15.702 --> 12:19.072
I'll bet him against
all your chips.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.208
  But there's
  over $250 in here.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.244
   What's the matter,
   chicken?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.279
 ( clucking )

12:28.314 --> 12:30.316
   I'm in.
   What do you have?

12:30.350 --> 12:34.220
   - Beat four queens, Maxwell.
   - Four ladies, right on.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.792
  Wow, four queens.
  That's the best
  hand we've had all night...

12:38.825 --> 12:41.227
- Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
- ...until now.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.730
  Four kings.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.832
- What?
- What?

12:50.837 --> 12:53.306
   So long, suckers.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.777
  Screech.
  Screech, I'm sorry.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.357
  Screech, are you all right?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.525
No! You lost Hound Dog!

13:12.559 --> 13:15.261
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hey, Screech.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.197
 It wasn't your fault?
 Yeah, right!

13:17.230 --> 13:20.300
   And maybe liver
   tastes good, huh?

13:20.333 --> 13:23.536
  - My mom's gonna kill me.
  - ( phone rings )

13:25.772 --> 13:28.375
 Yeah, what?
 Oh...

13:28.408 --> 13:30.310
   Mom! Hi.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.380
  Samuel,
  is everything okay?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.749
   No! I mean, yes.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.885
 Good. Let me say hi
 to Hound Dog.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.288
  She wants to say hi
  to Hound Dog. What do I do?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.324
   - Give me the phone.
   - What?

13:45.592 --> 13:49.329
   ( howls )

13:49.362 --> 13:53.333
   There's my Hound Dog.
   Mommy misses you.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.502
  Do you miss Mommy?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.504
   ( howls )

13:57.537 --> 14:01.241
   Oh, good. Now put
   your big brother back on.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.110
 ( howls )
 Okay.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.617
 - So how's your trip, Mom?
 - Oh, wonderful.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.452
  And what makes it
  even better

14:12.485 --> 14:14.821
is knowing
I can trust you
with the house.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.792
  We're so proud.
  Love you tender!
  ( kisses )

14:24.798 --> 14:27.901
  She said she was proud of me.
  I really messed up.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.170
   Don't worry,
   you're not alone.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.573
  You're right.
  I never could have
  messed up this much alone.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.778
 That does it.

14:38.812 --> 14:41.648
  Nerdstrom's gonna regret
  the day he met Zack Morris.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.683
Most of us already do.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.756
 - No, Slater, don't do it!
 - I'm gonna break
 him in two, Zack.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.558
He took
my buddy Screech's dog.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.226
   No, Slater.
   He won the dog
   fair and square.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.862
 Besides, you can get suspended
 for breaking a nerd.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.697
  I don't care
  what they do to me.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.533
  Nerdstrom, listen to me,
  you better get me
  that dog, or else.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.336
  Get away from me,
  or you'll be sorry.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.538
   - ( alarm blaring )
  <i>- Bully alert! Bully alert!</i>

15:05.572 --> 15:07.741
   It's the latest thing
   in dweeb defense.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.808
   Belding!

15:08.842 --> 15:11.478
Hey, hey, hey.
What is going on here?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.214
Nothing, sir.
Maxwell's nerd alarm...

15:14.247 --> 15:16.449
Went off by accident.
It's sensitive.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.485
 That's not what
 it looks like to me.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.653
Maxwell, are these two
harassing you?

15:23.757 --> 15:27.360
 Don't be afraid
 to speak out, son.
 I'm here to protect geeks...

15:29.262 --> 15:32.232
guys like you.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.703
 These fine lads
 were telling the truth, sir.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.539
  - Thanks for helping, fellas.
  - No problem.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.509
 Well, okay, if you say so.
 ( laughs )

15:42.542 --> 15:46.379
 Just remember, I'm gonna
 be watching you guys.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.751
  Okay, Maxwell,
  why didn't you turn us in?

15:51.785 --> 15:54.554
  There's something I want more
  than that mangy mutt.

15:54.587 --> 15:58.658
   How about a lifetime pass
   to the Hollywood
   Earwax Museum?

15:58.692 --> 16:00.060
   Tempting,

16:00.093 --> 16:03.797
but I'd rather swap the dog
for a date with Legs.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.399
 - The dog for Jessie?
 - Hey, wait a second,

16:06.433 --> 16:07.934
  she is not gonna
  like this, Preppie.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.538
 Yeah, she's gonna hate this.

16:12.772 --> 16:16.343
 Both:
 Let's do it.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.480
   Face it. lf we don't get
   another statue,
   Screech is dead.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.350
 See? It's not so bad.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.385
   Well, there's only
   one thing to do.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.619
   We'll just have a party.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.056
 Only you would think of having
 a party at a time like this.

16:30.056 --> 16:33.059
  And only I would charge
  ten bucks a head to get in.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.295
   Brilliant idea, Preppie.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.565
Kelly,
Lisa, go spread the word.
Screech's house, 7:00.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.533
We'll have the cheerleading
squad to help.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.370
  P-A-R-T-Y... at Screech's!

16:43.403 --> 16:46.072
Girl, you have got
to get a life.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.379
What can I do?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.815
 Well,
 you can help us figure out
 how to get Screech's dog back.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.183
   I'll do anything to help.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.887
 That's good, because Nerdstrom
 said he'd give
 the dog back if...

17:00.920 --> 17:03.289
  you go on a date with him.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.924
  And you told him no, right?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.660
Right?!

17:07.694 --> 17:09.695
  Come on, Jessie, look,
  all you have to do

17:09.729 --> 17:11.731
 is show up with him
 at the party.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.833
  And once we get the dog back,
  you can just ditch him.

17:13.867 --> 17:19.339
   Oh, no,
   no, no, I refuse to go out
   with that postnasal drip.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.474
 Okay, but you can tell Screech
 he'll never see his dog again.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.046
   Hey, Screech,
   can we get you anything?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.048
 A Coke, some fries...

17:28.048 --> 17:29.382
  a hot dog?

17:29.416 --> 17:32.852
  Dog?!
  ( sobbing )

17:32.886 --> 17:36.056
 So what if they've had him
 since he was a cuddly puppy.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.358
Puppy!

17:38.391 --> 17:39.793
 All right, one date.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.396
   But Nerdstrom better
   keep his paws to himself.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.733
 Paws!

17:46.766 --> 17:49.936
  Hey, guys,
  how's the Save Screech's
  Tushie Fund coming?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.672
Great. We almost have
enough for the statue.

17:52.706 --> 17:53.873
   Right on.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.412
  Hey, buds.
  Righteous shindig.

18:01.114 --> 18:06.086
 Just get the dog so I can lose
 Mr. Toxic Waste.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.822
   Hey, we had a deal,
   where's the dog?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.790
 ( scoffs )
 I'm no fool.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.926
 If I give you the dog now,
 then Spano splits.

18:13.026 --> 18:15.762
 So one of my buddies
 is keeping the canine company

18:15.795 --> 18:17.797
 until I give him the signal.

18:17.831 --> 18:22.669
  Come along, my tall treasure.
  Let's "rocka
  till we droppa."

18:22.702 --> 18:26.940
  Hey, I hear once you go geek,
  you never go back.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.877
  All right.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.047
   What a cute couple it is.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.050
   Zack, we did it!
   We have enough
   money to get the statue!

18:37.050 --> 18:39.052
All right! Go!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.722
   Help me!

18:43.690 --> 18:46.559
   Save me!

18:46.593 --> 18:48.895
 Poor Jessie.
 Maybe we should help her out.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.563
 Yeah, one of us should
 go over there

18:50.597 --> 18:51.798
   and dance with Nerdstrom.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.868
   - Go ahead.
   - Oh no, you go.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.504
 You're a much better dancer.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.572
Bag it. We'll buy her
lunch tomorrow.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.642
- Yeah.
- All right,
Nerdstrom, it's 10:00.

19:02.676 --> 19:05.745
   - Where's the dog?
   - I'm a man of
   my word, Morris.

19:05.779 --> 19:10.016
However,
a date officially ends
with a goodnight kiss.

19:10.050 --> 19:13.687
   Yeah? Then kiss yourself
   and go home.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.826
Hound Dog, you're back!

19:19.859 --> 19:22.662
   Come on, baby,
   where's my kiss?

19:22.696 --> 19:24.931
  Well, all right, Nerdstrom.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.633
It's only fair.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.769
  - ( low ) What?
  - Close your
  eyes and pucker up.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.045
 What a woman!

19:39.045 --> 19:43.216
 Now I know what
 I've been missing
 with lame lips here.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.586
 You can't talk to my girl
 like that, you squid!

19:46.619 --> 19:49.155
   You didn't even kiss Jessie,
   you kissed my dog!

19:49.189 --> 19:52.058
 - Now get out of my house!
 - ( spits )

19:55.061 --> 19:58.965
  Oh, Sammy,
  you're such a stud muffin.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.101
   I didn't know
   I was your girl.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.903
 Neither did I.
 Would you like to be?

20:03.937 --> 20:06.206
 Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.875
 Wait.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.978
   Forget the rules!

20:15.882 --> 20:18.752
 Screech, when are your
 parents supposed to be home?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.254
  - Sunday. Why?
  - Because... they're here!

20:21.287 --> 20:23.123
 ( everyone shouting )

20:24.924 --> 20:26.726
   What are we going to do?
   The party,

20:26.760 --> 20:27.927
  and Slater's not back yet!

20:27.961 --> 20:29.662
   Hey, hey, hey!
   Be cool.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.765
  I'm always prepared.
  Chill out.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.135
 - I'm home!
 - Mom, you're early.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.137
Samuel,

20:37.170 --> 20:39.272
   this looks like a party.

20:39.305 --> 20:43.743
  And that's a direct violation
  of Rule 137.

20:43.777 --> 20:46.946
 Zack, tell my mom
 why this looks like a party.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.684
Because it is a party.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.988
  Zack:
  Happy Anniversary!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.956
   - Thank you.
   - Come on, guys.

20:56.990 --> 21:01.061
  All:
  Happy Anniversary!

21:04.064 --> 21:06.633
I got it!
l got it! Yes!

21:22.716 --> 21:25.085
  - Zachary?
  - Yes, Mrs. Powers?

21:25.085 --> 21:27.087
There's something's
wrong with the statue.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.154
   There is?

21:28.188 --> 21:32.225
Yes. Elvis likes
to face the kitchen...

21:32.258 --> 21:35.128
   so he can watch me cook!

21:35.161 --> 21:38.832
   Now... let's boogie on down!
   Uh-huh!

21:38.865 --> 21:42.135
   ( cheering, music plays )

21:48.108 --> 21:50.643
 ( instrumental music plays )
