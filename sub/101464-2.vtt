-We're all okay. [whimpers]
-[snarling]

00:55.638 --> 00:58.850
Kenji, those bones--
check for a raptor skull.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.560
What?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.895
In the video game, I--

01:02.103 --> 01:04.147
You wanna talk about video games now?

[man 3] This way!

01:43.061 --> 01:45.021
-[man 2] Come on, move!
-Dave, that was...

01:45.605 --> 01:46.856
Thank you so much.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.609
Oh, that's standard procedure, Darius.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.487
I do that kind of stuff all the time.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.781
Give me a second. [vomits]

01:54.864 --> 01:56.407
[retches]

01:56.616 --> 01:57.992
That's better.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.120
-[Dave grunts]
-[pants]

02:00.203 --> 02:01.037
Are you hurt?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.622
Is everyone all right?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.167
Where do you think you're going?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.504
-You and Darius are in big trouble.
-I--

02:09.587 --> 02:11.631
-But he-- he was--
-Save it!

02:12.006 --> 02:14.134
We'll decide what to do with you later.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.886
If you even get to remain here
after a stunt like this.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.141
[door alarm beeps]

02:22.350 --> 02:23.977

[Kenji pops lips]

02:33.736 --> 02:34.612
[popping continues]

02:41.661 --> 02:43.580
How could you do something so stupid?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.250
I do a lot of stupid things,

02:47.333 --> 02:49.919
so you'll have to be
a little more specific than that.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.257
Girls love a grand gesture, junior.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.218
-You'll understand when you're older.
-[sighs]

02:58.386 --> 03:02.515
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best idea.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.559
Look, I don't wanna get kicked out either.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.727
When my dad...

03:07.687 --> 03:11.065
My whole life, I've been trying
to make him proud.

03:11.149 --> 03:15.111
If he finds out
that I messed up again, he might...

03:15.361 --> 03:17.238
finally give up on me for good.

03:17.989 --> 03:18.865
[door opens]

03:18.948 --> 03:21.534
We gave Brooklynn a warning
for sneaking out,

03:21.618 --> 03:24.621
-but what you two chuckleheads did--
-Especially you, Kenji!

03:24.704 --> 03:28.374
Your recklessness put yours, Darius,
and Dave's lives in danger!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.169
-We should call your parents--
-It was my fault!

03:32.670 --> 03:34.005
I jumped into the pit.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.298
Kenji was...

03:36.799 --> 03:38.301
trying to save me.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.220
Yeah, that's it.

03:40.303 --> 03:44.265
I... I was saving the poor,
confused little kid.

03:45.433 --> 03:49.270
I'm sorry, so,
Darius the dino-genius was saved

03:49.354 --> 03:54.234
by Kenji, the kid who thinks dinosaurs
went extinct because, and I quote,

03:54.317 --> 03:56.611
"Their farts turned the air trashy"?

03:57.278 --> 04:00.240
-Prove me wrong, yo.
-[sighs]

04:00.782 --> 04:03.868
Yeah, it's just that Brooklynn's account
is quite different from yours.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
Pfft! Brooklynn.

04:05.453 --> 04:10.166
Look, it was dark, she was confused,
she needs glasses. [chuckles]

04:10.250 --> 04:11.834
Vanity, am I right?

04:11.918 --> 04:15.463
What's important is that I'll keep
looking out for the kid, here.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.881
You're welcome.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.592
[Roxie] Mm-hmm.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.388
No harm, no foul. Let's chalk
the whole thing up to experience.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.182
Lessons, friendships--
this is what camp's about!

04:26.266 --> 04:28.184
-Who's with me?
-Fine.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.104
But one more misstep...

04:31.646 --> 04:35.900
-I... We won't let you down.
-[pops lips]

04:38.528 --> 04:40.613
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.574
[flies buzzing]

04:43.658 --> 04:45.785
[Roxie] Enjoy cleaning this up, boys.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.496
[retches]

04:48.579 --> 04:50.456
We're going to the genetics lab.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.836
[camera shutter clicks]

04:57.046 --> 04:59.090
Cologne. That'll help with the smell.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.926
And the ladies. What-what?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.177
But mostly the smell.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.138
The stench of dinosaur poo
can really linger.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.515
-What? But... [sighs]
-[engine starts]

05:12.061 --> 05:14.105
Ugh! Gross.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.740
Ugh. I'm still dropping followers?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.242
"When are we gonna see cool stuff"?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.952
Chill, dude. I just got here.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.746
So, what's your next video?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.623
Ooh, maybe there's baby dino eggs
in the lab.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.625
Everyone loves a baby video.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.545
-Whatever it is, it'll be cool.
-[Ben humming]

05:42.759 --> 05:43.593
[humming stops]

05:45.428 --> 05:46.804
Sanitizer.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.807
Who knows what kind
of creepy dino goo is at that lab?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.559
Gotta be ready for anything.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.227
The world is a grab-bag of gross,

05:53.311 --> 05:57.440
and we're all just along for the moist,
sticky roller coaster ride called life.

06:03.362 --> 06:06.574
Mm. Hmm. Hmm.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.745
[Brooklynn] What's good, Brooklanders?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.163
Today, I'm coming to you

06:12.246 --> 06:15.875
from one of Jurassic World's
coolest remote genetics labs!

06:17.668 --> 06:20.213
-[equipment trilling]
-[Sammy gasps]

06:20.296 --> 06:22.632
It's so shiny in here!

06:27.303 --> 06:29.764
This is a rare window
into the park's inner workings.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.849
Not just anyone can come here, you know.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.893
Yep, this is where the magic happens.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.229
Doc Wu-Wu!

06:36.312 --> 06:39.357
Guess who's ready to have
a blastocyst from the pastocyst?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.484
The mitosis with the mosisis!

06:41.567 --> 06:44.153
We're ready for some chromosomes,
my bro-mosome.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
Wu, there it is!

06:46.072 --> 06:47.865
-I can do more.
-Please don't.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.743
We're here for the tour, Dr. Wu.
Camp Cretaceous?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.161
Ms. Dearing should have mentioned.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.581
I'm sorry, but Mr. Masrani
has accelerated the timetable

06:55.665 --> 06:57.708
for our newest exhibit yet again.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.796
I simply don't have time to spend
the afternoon babysitting children.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.134
-Young lady, no recording in the lab.
-Huh?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.094
But that's kind of my whole deal.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.720
You see, I have my own web channel--

07:09.887 --> 07:12.557
And that's germane because...?

07:14.475 --> 07:16.769
[sighs] I'm sorry, Doctor.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.855
I just wanted my followers
to meet the genius

07:18.938 --> 07:21.023
who brought dinosaurs back to life.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.569
I mean, without you,
there is no Jurassic World.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.865
But, hey, if you wanna toil in the shadows
while Masrani and John Hammond

07:28.948 --> 07:32.702
get all the credit, I respect that.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.454
It's about the work.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.708
How many people watch
this web show of yours?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.501
-[flies buzzing]
-[Darius grunts]

07:40.751 --> 07:42.044
This bites!

07:42.128 --> 07:46.632
Thanks to you, I'm shoveling poop
instead of watching a live dinosaur birth.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.927
That's only been my dream
since, uh, I don't know... forever!

07:50.011 --> 07:52.430
Dude, that's not a dream.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.183
A dream is like when you save
mermaids from a shark.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.144
Whatever!
Figures you wouldn't understand.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.063
The scientists are heroes.
They recreated the T. rex!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.690
A T. rex!

08:02.773 --> 08:04.275
Do you know what it takes to do that?

08:04.358 --> 08:07.487
It's cute you're this excited
about some dumb lab.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.615
Noobs like you don't know
half of what's in this place.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.327
-Like what?
-[snickers]

08:14.827 --> 08:16.245
[scoffs] You're all talk.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.875
I've been to this park,
like, 50 kajillion times.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.376
I'm in the know, junior.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.295
And since you helped me out earlier,

08:24.378 --> 08:29.091
I might be willing to show you
the good stuff.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.344
No. No way.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.137
I cannot get into more trouble.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.388
Eh. Hey, suit yourself.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.599
You've been waiting a lifetime
to see dinosaurs.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.269
Just thought you'd be interested in seeing
one they stopped showing to the public.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.730
But... whatevs.

08:43.314 --> 08:46.484
It's only a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.657
Ka-ching!

08:53.115 --> 08:54.700
Where's this tunnel go?

08:54.784 --> 08:58.538
This tu-hu-nel is part
of an underground network

08:58.621 --> 09:00.790
connecting the whole island.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.376
This is how the big dogs get around.

09:04.126 --> 09:08.464
You're actually looking
at a Jurassic World VIP, kid.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.191
[hatch hisses]

09:28.317 --> 09:29.318
Kenji?

09:29.860 --> 09:32.071
-[lights click]
-[electricity crackles]

09:34.448 --> 09:37.034
You still bummed about that genetics lab?

09:41.372 --> 09:44.875
-[Brooklynn] <i>Okay, Dr. Wu, you're on.</i>
-[clears throat]

09:44.959 --> 09:49.005
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Henry Wu, PhD.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:53.009
<i>Welcome to one of our satellite</i>
<i>Jurassic World genetics labs.</i>

09:53.092 --> 09:56.887
<i>I like to say that creating</i>
<i>a dinosaur takes TIME--</i>

09:57.138 --> 10:03.477
<i>T, technology; I, ingenuity; and M-E, me.</i>

10:03.561 --> 10:06.230
<i>Whoa! Eyeball! Ooh!</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:07.940
-[shudders]
-[camera shutter clicks]

10:08.482 --> 10:10.026
Dr. Wu, what's that?

10:10.359 --> 10:11.986
Tree frog DNA.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.070
Unfortunately, I--

10:13.154 --> 10:17.116
-[gasps] What's that?
-Siberian mammoth remains extracted for--

10:17.408 --> 10:20.453
Ooh! What's down that hall?

10:20.536 --> 10:22.163
My private office.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.247
It's restricted.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.833
You guys, look!

10:25.916 --> 10:28.794
Oh, I think one of these eggs
is about to hatch.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.671
That's not possible.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.262
That ankylosaurus
has only been incubating for ten weeks.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.726
[Yasmina gasps] Is that a tail?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.520
-Oh-hh. Oh, ew, ew, ew!
-[squelches]

10:46.604 --> 10:48.272
-Get it off me! Get it--
-[camera shutter clicks]

10:53.611 --> 10:54.654
[grunts]

11:02.370 --> 11:04.205
[squealing]

11:04.288 --> 11:07.166
-[chuckles] Aw!
-Sweet!

11:07.249 --> 11:09.126
One of its head bumps
is bigger than the other!

11:09.293 --> 11:11.671
Asymmetry? In my lab?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.756
Aw! Wow.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.384
She's so... tiny.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.511
But she won't stay tiny for long, right?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.388
That's the idea.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.557
All the dinosaurs go through
an accelerated growth cycle.

11:23.974 --> 11:28.187
They're supposed to incubate for 13 weeks
with no noticeable defects,

11:28.270 --> 11:30.981
but apparently this one slipped through.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.027
[Darius] For real, though,
where are you taking me?

11:35.111 --> 11:38.948
Are we seeing a secret T. rex
or a rare sauropod?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.367
Kid, Kenji has something better
than a rare sauropod.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.954
We're headed to where they quarantine
the dinos that are too aggro.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.040
The last one I saw here
was some kind of carna...

11:48.249 --> 11:49.542
carna-something.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.710
Hold up. Carnotaur?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.839
[muffled] We're gonna see a carnotaurus?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.842
[normal voice] That's, like,
one of my top five favorite dinos!

11:57.925 --> 11:58.759
Sweet, right?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.012
The park board actually offered
to name it after me,

12:02.096 --> 12:05.808
but I was like, "Nah, I'll hold out
for something cooler."

12:05.891 --> 12:09.061
But I figured you'd like it,
you know, as a thanks,

12:09.437 --> 12:14.650
which is what this is for, uh, you know,
not being a narc when--

12:14.733 --> 12:18.529
So, there's, like, a carnotaurus
right-- right up there?

12:18.737 --> 12:20.448
Obviously.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.992
Like my boy Masrani always says,

12:23.075 --> 12:26.036
"When Kenji promises, Kenji delivers."

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
-[buzzer blares]
-Phew!

12:32.251 --> 12:35.171
Let's go melt your nerd-brain, junior.

[Darius grunts]

12:52.021 --> 12:54.773
Uh, you do know where you're going, right?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.318
Trust me, I got this on lock.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.946
The pen, heh, is...

13:01.614 --> 13:02.823
that way.

13:04.575 --> 13:05.826
What am I doing?

13:07.286 --> 13:10.372
[hatch whirs]

13:28.140 --> 13:29.058
-Oof!
-Huh?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.434
Oh! Hey!

13:30.976 --> 13:34.730
Sammy! Uh, what are you doing out here?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.774
I was just... [chuckles]

13:36.857 --> 13:39.109
This place ought to come with a GPS.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.320
I really gotta go.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.949
I... I think there's a bathroom
on the other end of the hall, actually.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.576
-So...
-Thanks! See you back there!

14:00.005 --> 14:02.341
[footsteps thudding]

14:05.970 --> 14:06.845
[man] Doctor!

14:08.514 --> 14:10.307
We have those results
you were looking for.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.308
Very well.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.358
Okay, Brooklanders,

14:19.441 --> 14:23.279
let's see if top-secret Jurassic World
intel is cool enough for you.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.191

15:43.233 --> 15:45.319

-[grunting]

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
Where is that stupid fence?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.173
Kenji, maybe we should head back.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.676
We don't wanna get caught
and cause trouble with your dad.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.136
What does my dad have to do with anything?

16:11.220 --> 16:14.223
Dude's barely around.
He's not worrying about me.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.183
What?

16:16.266 --> 16:17.309
Then what was all the,

16:17.393 --> 16:21.146
[imitates Kenji] "My whole life I've been
trying to make my dad proud, junior."

16:21.230 --> 16:22.982
Oh, right.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.026
I was lying...

16:26.527 --> 16:29.488
'cause of the whole not wanting
to get in trouble and sent home thing.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.535
Forgive me for not wanting to spend
another summer alone.

16:34.618 --> 16:39.123
In fact, when you really think about it,
this is on you for being so gullible.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.792
[normal voice] I can't believe this.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.795
There is no carnotaurus, is there?

16:45.045 --> 16:47.214
Hey, I keep it honest!

16:47.297 --> 16:49.883
Except this morning.
And, like, a bunch of other times today.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.845
-But I'm telling the truth about this!
-Great!

16:52.928 --> 16:55.806
I'm out here for no reason,
I'll probably get sent home,

16:55.889 --> 16:57.558
and it's all because I believed you!

16:57.641 --> 17:00.102
Fine, whatever.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.730
Last time I try to do something nice
for a dumb kid.

like the back of your hand, right?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.425
Uh, duh!

17:31.925 --> 17:35.888
So, you definitely know which side
of the fence the carnotaurus is on?

Well, that's it, Ben.
Looks like you live here now.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.458
-Time for you all to leave.
-[Brooklynn] Hey!

18:04.541 --> 18:07.294
Clearly, this group
has no respect for my lab.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.130
-But what about Bumpy?
-Aw, Bumpy!

18:10.214 --> 18:11.965
You gave it a name. That's precious!

18:12.049 --> 18:16.512
The asset will soon be released
into a herd of ankylosauruses.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.263
Then she'll be their problem,

18:18.347 --> 18:22.601
just like you all will cease to be
my problem when you leave.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.104
All right, bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

18:25.187 --> 18:27.231

18:59.346 --> 19:01.181
It's fast, but not on turns!

19:01.265 --> 19:02.891
Zig-zag, on my count!

hurt his widdle nose?

You think you're slick, Toro?
You got nothin'!

Toro. 'Cause-- 'Cause of the horns.

Yeah, I get it.

Hey, Toro, your arms are...

20:03.327 --> 20:06.747
pretty much vestigial at this point! Ha!

20:13.712 --> 20:14.588
Uh...

back from the lab?

[both panting]

20:21.553 --> 20:22.930
Hey, guys.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.558
Why are you two so out of breath?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.477
Just doing the job we're told.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.062
How was the field trip?

20:30.270 --> 20:33.899
Oh, well, um, you know,
Ben fell in love with a dinosaur,

20:33.982 --> 20:37.611
and Super Star here
got us booted from the lab.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.906
-That is not what happen--
-How'd poop patrol go?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.199
-Uh...
-Awesome!

20:42.282 --> 20:45.702
-You all should've seen how I owned--
-This valuable experience!

20:45.786 --> 20:49.498
Um, learned a lot about ourselves
and, uh... yep!

20:50.707 --> 20:53.877
[sniffs] Oh! Well, then, hit the showers.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.546
And maybe stay in there for a while?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.298
Use soap.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.009
Lots of soap!

21:02.219 --> 21:04.805
Two near-death experiences in two days?

21:04.888 --> 21:08.725
We can't tell anyone about Toro
or we're definitely getting sent home.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.768
[sighs]

21:09.851 --> 21:13.480
I can't believe no one will know
I saved your life.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.274
I'll know, Kenji.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.695
[sighs] Thanks. [chuckles]

21:20.028 --> 21:22.823
So, we even now, Darius?

21:24.533 --> 21:26.535
Yeah, we're even.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.873
You do know farts
didn't kill the dinosaurs, right?

21:32.207 --> 21:33.875
Prove me wrong, yo.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.419
There is a lot of proof--

21:35.502 --> 21:37.796
Okay, first I'm going to take
a five-hour shower,

21:37.879 --> 21:40.841
and then tonight we're going over
how the atmosphere works.
