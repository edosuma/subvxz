WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:05.089
So now, how does Planck resolve

00:05.089 --> 00:07.550
the Blackbody radiation--

00:07.550 --> 00:11.887
well, not just problem,
but as it was called,

00:11.887 --> 00:14.432
the ultraviolet catastrophe,

00:14.432 --> 00:16.600
which is also the name
of my college band.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.979
No, we were called, "The Ultraviolets",

00:19.979 --> 00:22.606
but if you heard us, catastrophe.

00:24.316 --> 00:28.446
All right. He does it by using
Wien's radiation law.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.072
Okay. And that's...

00:31.490 --> 00:32.992
How could you?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.203
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.665
Ms. Camore is one of my grad students.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.459
And I think she's having a rough day.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.587
You stole my research.

00:46.464 --> 00:47.590
All of it.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.676
You published it without my name.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.678
Oh, my God, do you think that's true?

00:58.476 --> 00:59.769
Okay.

01:00.686 --> 01:05.357
Well, if the paper is really your work,

01:07.610 --> 01:09.862
why don't you walk us through it?

01:09.862 --> 01:13.240
It should be easy to explain
if it's truly yours.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.871
That's not--I, I mean, I--I can't just--

01:18.871 --> 01:20.372
it's not that simple.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.041
Yeah, because it's my theorem.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.168
The Gray Theorem.

01:24.794 --> 01:26.796
My name is on it.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.013
Um...

01:37.973 --> 01:39.225
we start with...

01:41.936 --> 01:44.814
let X be...

01:45.439 --> 01:46.273
um...

01:48.818 --> 01:51.237
consider a hydrogen atom...

01:52.947 --> 01:54.657
um, we start with...

02:09.797 --> 02:11.715
Oh, okay. I think that's enough.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.137
I fear science is not for you, Emma.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.683
- No, I can...
- I think we're good.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.029
Well, speaking of catastrophe.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.658
Uh, where were we? Right.
Wien's radiation law.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.516
You're gonna have to fill me in.

03:02.516 --> 03:07.187
What are Stochastic Models
of Muon Interactions?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.397
Okay. Bottom line,

03:08.397 --> 03:09.815
Emma came up with a piece of math

03:09.815 --> 03:13.027
that could, in the future,
be used to develop clean energy

03:13.027 --> 03:16.196
like massive amounts of it,
like cold fusion.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.991
It's just a building block
that could be used

03:18.991 --> 03:22.661
for something like cold fusion but--
decades from now.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.164
But Dr. Gray had you
kicked out of his class

03:25.164 --> 03:26.332
and then kicked out of his lab?

03:26.332 --> 03:28.417
I--I considered going
to the administration,

03:28.417 --> 03:32.504
but it would be me versus
world-famous Dr. Daniel Gray.

03:32.504 --> 03:36.133
He's always on the news,
name-checking the school on live TV.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.053
Plus, I found out that he had filed
a complaint against me,

03:39.428 --> 03:42.723
uh, saying I was having one
of my mental episodes.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.309
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to back up.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.064
I--I take meds for anxiety.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.065
Oh.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.692
Without them,
I can barely speak to other people

03:53.692 --> 03:57.863
and heck, it's, um, hard
even talking to you now.

03:59.073 --> 04:03.118
So how did Dr. Gray get his hands
on your research?

04:04.995 --> 04:06.956
I showed it to him.

04:06.956 --> 04:10.125
He--he's my faculty advisor.
I wanted his opinion.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.922
He called it banal, so I took it home.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.522
Emma. Emma, look at me.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.149
You haven't done anything wrong.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.943
Just breathe

04:35.943 --> 04:39.196
in and out.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.950
Breanna believes in you, okay?

04:43.867 --> 04:44.868
Carry on.

04:48.122 --> 04:52.209
A couple days later, I came home
to find my apartment had been broken into

04:52.209 --> 04:54.753
and my hard drive
with all of my work was gone.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.132
So then Emma's research ends up
published under Dr. Gray's name.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.385
And now, it's the word of America's
favorite science professor against...

05:01.385 --> 05:04.722
A lowly grad student who won't...

05:04.722 --> 05:08.100
<i>can't</i> even speak in class.

05:09.768 --> 05:14.398
Look, without my research job,
I can't finish my PhD.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.066
I can't even teach.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.616
He stole your future.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.245
I just wanna be able to keep doing
what I love.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.797
This is Dr. Daniel Gray.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.884
I want him bagged and gagged
and sitting in front of me in two hours.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.927
And now we're talking. Elliot?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.012
You'll have him back in one.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.806
Parker. She's--she's kidding.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.058
Breanna, tell her.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.394
All right. Fine.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.313
Wait a minute.
Haven't I seen this guy on the news?

05:54.313 --> 05:57.066
Doesn't he, like, sit around and argue
with other science dorks?

05:57.066 --> 06:00.486
Yes. And he sides with whoever pays him
the biggest consulting fee

06:00.486 --> 06:03.781
that includes climate change deniers
and corporate polluters

06:03.781 --> 06:06.366
that need you to think that
maybe there's another cause

06:06.366 --> 06:07.701
for all these people getting sick.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.286
Hmm. So he's a fake scientist?

06:09.286 --> 06:10.662
Well, no.

06:10.662 --> 06:14.625
But he is stealing from his grad students
like Emma Camore

06:14.625 --> 06:17.294
from his lofty tenured perch at UL NOLA.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.880
Oh, I know that campus.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.466
That's UL NOLA, the Grinning Gators.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.760
I did my undergraduate there.
Breanna, you would love it.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.222
- Hard pass. A library card is free.
- Come on. Come on.

06:28.222 --> 06:31.475
College is all about secret handshakes
and study groups,

06:31.475 --> 06:33.602
and those little yellow pills
you probably shouldn't trust.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.105
Seriously,
some of the best years of my life.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.690
Harry, just admit it, college is a scam.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.983
It is--its money.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.529
It is crippling debt, the commodification
of knowledge, cheap labor.

06:43.529 --> 06:46.490
The whole thing is just set up
to take advantage of people.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.451
Since the rise of social media,

06:49.451 --> 06:52.079
universities have become
very sensitive to this kind of thing,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.206
UL NOLA
it has a strict plagiarism policy.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.959
Now, I know that Emma didn't want to go
to the Judiciary Committee,

06:56.959 --> 07:00.087
but I did raise a lot of money
for the alumni association.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.547
I think I can guarantee you a hearing.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.382
So you think because the system
always works for you,

07:03.382 --> 07:04.383
the system always works?

07:04.383 --> 07:06.927
I just thought if Emma
wants to get her PhD back

07:06.927 --> 07:09.054
and her research back,
she can do that legally.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.682
Okay. Well, that's gonna take forever.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.643
When you say legally,
you don't mean we can't steal anything?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.562
Yes. I mean, no, we can't.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.022
Got it.
"No, but yes."

07:19.022 --> 07:22.734
No. Just no.
Like, as in no crime.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.653
What we need
is a little bit more evidence.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.113
How about a stolen hard drive
in Gray's office?

07:28.115 --> 07:31.869
Uh, okay. Maybe one teeny,
tiny, little crime.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.120
All right, then.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.955
We try the official route.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.790
Harry's on Dr. Gray

07:36.790 --> 07:38.584
while Parker and Breanna
break into his office.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.003
If that hard drives in there,
we're gonna get it.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.633
God, I used to love this place.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.887
Hanging out in the quad,
ultimate frisbee tournaments.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.764
Can someone please explain to me
what makes the frisbee ultimate?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.975
Oh, mostly the total lack
of responsibility.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.894
No ultimate frisbee in your university?

07:56.894 --> 07:59.563
<i>Yeah. I went to the school of life.</i>

07:59.563 --> 08:03.150
Actually, I do have three
honorary degrees in various names.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.944
- Dean Deninger.
- Harry.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.738
- I hope you brought your checkbook.
- Always. Always.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.449
Although between you and me,
I'm doing a little IP work lately.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.076
And I had a couple of questions
about one of your big guns, Daniel Gray.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.245
Oh, one of our most
distinguished professors.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.456
He's guided the best minds for decades.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.208
Even Darren Nash
was one of the students.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.542
Darren Nash, the tech billionaire?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.961
- He claims he dropped out of college.
- Yeah, he did.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.714
His sophomore year,
but we still get to claim him.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.674
- You wanna meet Dr. Gray?
- Yes, I do.

08:27.674 --> 08:31.094
Dr. Gray's lab, run over and grab him,
and bring him over as fast you can.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.932
Breanna, Parker, Gray's being pulled now.

08:34.932 --> 08:39.311
All right.
I'm gonna clip into the cameras.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.772
Russell said there was only
one guard on duty today,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.483
so if it gets rough,
it shouldn't be a problem.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.738
What you doing up there, boy?

08:52.366 --> 08:54.409
Stealing on a college campus
is like cheating.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.994
There's so many people
coming and going.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.121
Nobody knows if you're supposed
to be here or not.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.291
- See, they just let us right in.
- Parker.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.627
All right. Once Eliot takes out our guard,
we'll be home free.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.514
They said they'd be
sending somebody to fix this up,

09:15.514 --> 09:18.267
but you're looking way
in the wrong place, kid.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.605
Well, I was--look, I'm trying to get
a bird's eye view of the, um...

09:23.605 --> 09:25.565
You remind me of my son.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.192
I lost him in the Gulf War.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.485
You ever served?

09:29.278 --> 09:30.362
Yes, sir, I did.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.532
- This way.
- Yeah. Let me grab my bag real quick.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.118
Sophie, I can't take this guy out.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.452
<i>You can't take out one guy?</i>

09:37.452 --> 09:39.621
No. I'm not taking <i>this</i> guy out, okay?

09:39.621 --> 09:44.209
He's a gold star. Life-size teddy bear
lost a son in the Gulf War.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.586
I can keep him occupied,
but the cameras are a no-go.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.466
All right. Eliot's dropped the ball.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.510
<i>Harry, keep Gray distracted.</i>

09:53.510 --> 09:56.430
You want me to distract a genius?

09:56.430 --> 09:59.266
Okay.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.770
Dr. Gray, I'd like you to meet
Harry Wilson, BA '92.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.689
- Uh-hmm.
- I'm a big fan.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.567
Uh, well, it's nice to meet
a fellow enthusiast of new discovery.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.861
Oh, wow. I have a question though,

10:10.861 --> 10:11.987
- maybe you can answer it.
- Okay.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.573
Magnets.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.659
What about them?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.453
What are they really?

10:20.245 --> 10:21.246
Oh, boy.

10:21.246 --> 10:25.625
It's like Newton and Niels Bohr
had a baby in here.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.710
Hard drives.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.713
Oh, you know what?

10:29.713 --> 10:31.840
Speaking of discoveries,

10:31.840 --> 10:35.135
I heard there was a little issue
in your lecture the other day.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.763
A grad student claimed
that your latest paper

10:37.763 --> 10:40.557
was stolen from her research?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.852
Okay. That was an unfortunate incident
with a very confused young woman.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.104
Ah. Ah. Uh-huh.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.691
Uh, but don't you think
just to protect the university

10:49.691 --> 10:53.403
that there should be a judicial committee
hearing just so that all sides could...

10:53.403 --> 10:55.655
Okay. I don't have time
for a judicial committee hearing.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.823
- Oh.
- Yeah. Okay.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.242
Listen, it's wonderful chatting
with you, Mr. Wilson.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.452
- Hey.
- Yeah.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.122
Okay. I don't wanna speak to him again.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.379
Gray took off. I lost him.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.300
Gray's on his way back
to the physics building.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.098
Oh.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.235
Okay. I think I found the hard drive.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.820
Great.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.279
Ooh.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.241
- Notebooks, got them.
- Good.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.910
Hold on.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.453
Come on, come. Jackpot.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.455
- It is fully intact.
- Great.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.421
- I am ready.
- Okay.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.715
No time. Need to hide.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.885
Hide where?
Under the textbooks?

11:59.970 --> 12:00.971
Come on.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.181
Parker?

12:09.563 --> 12:10.730
What are you doing in here?

12:20.031 --> 12:21.741
I said, what are you doing?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.036
The trash can is over there.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.746
You missed it for the last three weeks.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.166
Oh, no, I'm not--
I'm not the custodial staff,

12:29.166 --> 12:33.879
although that is an honorable profession
and should be respected by everyone.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.089
Then, what are you doing in my office?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.716
Snooping behind my desk.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.343
I, uh...

12:40.343 --> 12:45.640
I heard that you had an opening
in your PhD program.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.517
Where'd you hear that?

12:47.517 --> 12:50.645
You know, science departments,
they gossip.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.901
I--I would really appreciate a spot.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.611
Why my program?

12:57.611 --> 13:02.282
Because you--you're--you're Dr. Gray.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.495
You're the best physics researcher
in the school, in the state.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.705
I mean, you wear those
really cool glasses on TV.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.542
Okay. Well...

13:14.169 --> 13:17.005
if you're worthy being in my lab.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.008
You can prove smooth solutions
from Navier-Stokes equations

13:20.008 --> 13:21.426
in three dimensions.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.138
Uh...

13:26.806 --> 13:30.185
Just considering the fact that
they're only proven in two dimensions,

13:30.185 --> 13:32.312
if I could do that,
I wouldn't need a PhD.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.066
Besides, unless we're talking about
magnetic hydrodynamics,

13:36.066 --> 13:38.109
they aren't really applicable
to energy research anyways.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.861
Unless of course you're talking about
the models of plasma

13:39.861 --> 13:41.988
and a Tomahawk fusion reactor,

13:41.988 --> 13:43.573
which is way out there
on the cutting edge.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.618
But that would make sense
because that is where you are.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.456
Uh, come see me at the lab on Monday.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.875
Bring your transcripts.
We'll talk some more.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.961
Now, if you'll excuse me...

13:55.961 --> 13:58.380
And grab the trash on your way out.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.107
That is a thing of beauty.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.192
That's proof that Gray
stole from Emma.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.111
Uh, problem.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.531
It says Gray is gonna sell this
to Klesco Corporation this afternoon.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.117
- Klesco's big oil.
- The theorem is published.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.286
How do you sell a piece
of public information?

14:29.286 --> 14:30.579
It's not really a sale.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.205
Gray and the university
keep the patent

14:32.205 --> 14:33.999
and Klesco'd just be leasing it
for future research.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.043
It's clean energy. They're gonna bury this
and then cut Gray a fat check.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.630
Hmm. We need to delay the meeting,
so Harry can do is weird not crime thing.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.633
Eliot, unless you run
into your personal kryptonite.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.219
- The man's name is Floyd.
- You're on the professor.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.264
We run our shifts in the night.
The rest of us are on Klesco. Let's go.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.149
Oh, my God, sorry.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.488
Hey! Why is this door locked?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.699
Well, watch your step.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.743
I gotta be honest with you,

15:09.743 --> 15:12.829
I think I installed the door knob backwards.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.122
What does that mean?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.333
It means that I should have
turned it around

15:16.333 --> 15:17.626
before I put it in the door.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.127
I mean, what does that mean for me?

15:19.127 --> 15:22.005
Oh, well, that means keyhole
is on your side.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.008
Are you some kind of total moron?
How am I supposed to open the door?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.635
Well, you got the key, right?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.386
I don't have the key.
You have the key.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.020
Gray is locked in
and I'm heading to the lab.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.690
Breanna, any news on Klesco?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.984
Expensive suit, cheap tie.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.736
I got eyes on our oil exec.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.407
Oh! Oh, my God. Are you okay?

15:49.407 --> 15:51.576
Oh, man. You got to watch out
for these frisbees.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.745
Ultimate.
It's like a battle zone out here.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.622
I'm fine. It's fine.

15:56.539 --> 15:57.832
I'm due for a meeting.

15:57.832 --> 15:58.875
You're headed that way.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.753
Oh, uh, yeah. Thanks.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.047
All good. Have a good one.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.633
He's all yours.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.720
Sir, you can stop banging on the door.
I know you're still in the room.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.222
Yeah, I have somewhere important to be.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.557
- Well...
- You--I'm calling your boss

16:14.557 --> 16:15.892
and having you so fired.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.478
How does someone like you
even qualify to hold a job?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.860
Are we ready?
You are gonna do great.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.196
All we're doing is
requesting a hearing from the dean.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.407
And we got all the evidence on our side.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.283
I can't go in there.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.494
I can't you do it without me?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.038
Well, yeah, I could. But...

16:37.038 --> 16:39.124
Uh, I--I can stay with her.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.167
Um... are you sure that's okay?

16:42.836 --> 16:46.256
Look, if there's any lawyer that I trust,
it's gonna be Harry.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.222
Oh, you are the man from Klesco, yeah?

16:54.222 --> 16:57.183
I'm so sorry,
Dr. Gray stuck in something,

16:57.183 --> 17:00.311
but he asked me to show you
what I'm working on.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.522
Um, I'm just here to finalize
some paperwork.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.816
Oh, it won't take long.

17:04.816 --> 17:09.362
Anyway, the last subject fled,
so you will be perfect.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.989
Uh-huh.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.076
Who you got in there?

17:16.911 --> 17:19.122
Professor Gray.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.170
You know, how many times that man
has told me to take his trash out?

17:25.170 --> 17:26.296
Hello?

17:26.296 --> 17:28.089
It's gonna be a hell to pay
when you open up.

17:29.215 --> 17:34.929
Any visions, out-of-body experiences,
recent blows to the head?

17:38.099 --> 17:41.519
Yeah. Actually, I was--
this girl with a frisbee. Just...

17:41.519 --> 17:46.649
We are simply measuring reactions.

17:46.649 --> 17:50.487
Now, you work in corporate energy.

17:50.487 --> 17:55.158
Do you prefer to pollute
the land or the sea?

17:56.201 --> 17:57.452
I don't pollute. I just...

17:57.452 --> 17:59.329
Mmm. Hmm.

17:59.788 --> 18:00.789
What was that?

18:00.789 --> 18:05.877
The sensors, they tell me
when your morality is compromised.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.420
You mean it's a lie detector?

18:07.420 --> 18:10.423
No, no, no, no, no.
It is much more than that.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.093
It tells me when
you are lying to yourself.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.808
For example,
by buying this theorem from Dr. Gray,

18:19.808 --> 18:22.727
you seek to hide it from the world.

18:23.812 --> 18:27.273
Klesco corporation simply wants
to research the possibility.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.361
Hello?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.862
Still in here.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.072
Who is this guy?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.491
Jesus.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.036
Well.

18:40.745 --> 18:41.955
Whoa.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.709
Can we just wait
and let him stew in there overnight?

18:50.255 --> 18:52.215
What's happening out there?

18:52.215 --> 18:53.633
Yeah. I better let him out.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.762
Thank you.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.768
You have screwed
in your last light bulb.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.687
Do you know who I am?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.482
Professor Daniel Gray.
Physics Department.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.734
I don't know.
Just a shot in the dark.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.947
That's right. And no one gets in my way
at this school without paying the price.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.449
Nobody.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.369
There's coffee. Watch your step.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.124
Boy, you do like living on edge
don't you, New Blood?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.878
It wouldn't be the first of us
Gray tried to get fired.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.546
Don't worry.

19:31.546 --> 19:32.672
We got your back.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.008
Okay. Who's we?

19:36.217 --> 19:37.510
I--I don't wanna do this.

19:41.139 --> 19:45.643
Lying to yourself is painful, isn't it?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.395
- I hate my job.
- Oh?

19:47.395 --> 19:48.980
I hate who I am.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.398
I don't even recycle.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.984
- Oh, Jeff. There you are.
- I can't.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.361
I can't be a part of this
blood money scheme anymore.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.988
No, no.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.407
Jeff? No. Jeff!

20:00.617 --> 20:01.993
Unbelievable.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.495
He keeps bringing his garbage
from home.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.997
He has a baby.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.749
It smells. That ain't right.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.042
No, no, no.

20:09.042 --> 20:14.172
Let's not clear his office trash bins
for seven days.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.716
We're gonna let him sit
with those diapers.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.217
Yes, yes.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.055
That's what I'm talking about.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.556
This is we.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.351
Security guards, janitors,

20:26.351 --> 20:27.977
some groundskeepers,

20:28.519 --> 20:30.480
low man on the totem pole.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.566
- Easy targets for people like Dr. Gray.
- That's right.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.109
But we look out for each other, don't we?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.110
- Yeah.
- We do. We do.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.364
Anybody else that wears a uniform
around here.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.823
Including you.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.660
Hey, Poobah,

20:43.660 --> 20:45.203
I got somebody here
I want you to meet.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.123
- New Blood.
- New Blood.

20:49.123 --> 20:53.002
Uh, expect you'll be getting in a call
about his willful insubordination

20:53.002 --> 20:55.838
any minute from our friend Dr. Gray.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.924
Gray?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.385
Well, you know,
how seriously we take his demands.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.096
Right.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.472
All right.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.021
This university has a strict policy
against plagiarism

21:12.021 --> 21:15.149
and given the fact that her--her--
her work was a keystroke match

21:15.149 --> 21:16.442
for the theorem that Gray published.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.111
She worked in this lab.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.863
Now, how do I know your client
didn't steal that from Dr. Gray?

21:20.863 --> 21:22.657
All the corroborating evidence, her notes,

21:22.657 --> 21:24.617
and you got Emma herself,
who will tell you...

21:24.617 --> 21:25.868
And where is she?

21:27.996 --> 21:30.665
Yes. The school has a strict
plagiarism policy,

21:30.665 --> 21:32.834
but Dr. Gray has never
crossed any lines.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.419
There's not a piece of evidence
that I can bring you

21:34.419 --> 21:36.170
that would make any difference, right?

21:36.170 --> 21:37.922
Because he brings in
too much money for you.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.094
You're not foolish, Harry.
I always appreciate that about you.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.813
- Well?
- Well...

21:55.064 --> 21:56.107
What happened?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.693
Seems all the progress
that's been made around here

21:58.693 --> 22:00.611
hasn't made its way
to Dean Deninger's door.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.328
So there's nothing we can do
to get the university to take down Gray?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.580
Nope.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.833
We have to get Gray
to take himself down.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.586
- Parker?
- Need more crime?

22:18.421 --> 22:20.465
We need all the crime.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.134
That's what I like to hear.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.103
Okay. Good.
Breanna says that Emma was okay.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.190
I still can't believe that the dean
accused her of stealing from Gray.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.026
I can. Do you know how easy it is
to steal stuff from a college?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.487
Sheesh. I got a library book.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.447
- I got some lab stuff.
- You can't--

22:44.447 --> 22:45.948
Got a bunch of keys.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.493
Damn it, Parker.
Floyd's been looking all over for those.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.744
Oh...

22:49.744 --> 22:53.998
Look, if the university
is protecting Dr. Gray,

22:53.998 --> 22:56.959
then we have to get him
to sever that relationship.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.420
Well, we just took a whole big chunk
of money off of him.

22:59.420 --> 23:04.008
Yeah. Maybe we can lure him into quitting

23:04.008 --> 23:06.135
by dangling a massive payday
in front of him.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.470
All right. Well, he's a thief.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.223
Thieves and liars always think
everybody else is a thief and a liar.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.182
Harsh, but fair.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.768
So then we make him believe
that Emma stole the research

23:13.768 --> 23:16.979
from someone else and then get him
to think that he's underselling it.

23:16.979 --> 23:20.316
Hmm. You mean, he wants a profit
before the chickens come home to roost.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.984
I already have a lab coat.

23:21.984 --> 23:25.321
Let's go pre-steal groundbreaking
technology before it was stolen,

23:25.321 --> 23:27.532
so that we can steal it back.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.075
Oh, boy.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.827
That's why we let Sophie do those.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.286
No. That makes sense.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.206
Let's go pre-steal a groundbreaking
because it was stolen once before

23:35.206 --> 23:37.166
and we're trying to steal--
no, that makes sense.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.757
You know, when I tracked your phone,

23:44.757 --> 23:48.094
I expected you to be holed
up in like a lab or a library somewhere,

23:48.094 --> 23:51.013
but here you are, under a giant tree.

23:51.889 --> 23:55.476
As the story goes,
this is where physics began,

23:55.476 --> 23:56.769
under a tree.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.313
I'm gonna miss it here,

24:00.398 --> 24:03.025
getting my PhD, doing research.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.444
It's all I've ever wanted.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.200
Look, if you wanna take down Gray,

24:11.200 --> 24:13.119
we can make that happen.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.038
But we are gonna need a little help.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.252
Well, your recommendations
are impressive.

24:21.252 --> 24:25.006
Yeah. Dr. Tennant and Dr. Whitaker,
they're both really excellent mentors.

24:25.006 --> 24:28.676
I just--I felt like I needed someone
with a little stronger bona fides

24:28.676 --> 24:30.261
to guide my dissertation.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.054
What's your dissertation topic?

24:32.054 --> 24:35.183
Oh, stochastic models
of muon-catalyzed fusion.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.103
Interesting. I just published
a paper on that very topic.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.397
That is why I sought you out.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.774
It was honestly a toss-up
between you and Dr. Williams,

24:43.774 --> 24:47.612
but I just--I didn't find her research
quite as developed as yours.

24:47.612 --> 24:48.905
I'm sorry. Who?

24:48.905 --> 24:50.448
Dr. Diana Williams?

24:50.448 --> 24:51.490
No?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.201
Oh, she's a visiting professor here.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.369
I'm sorry. I, I assumed
that you two had collaborated

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
your work is... so similar.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.124
Oh, yeah, visiting.
People come and go so quickly.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.375
- I don't really get to know them, so.
- Oh, no.

25:01.375 --> 25:05.129
I--I think you had a grad student
in her summer lab.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.549
It's, um--ooh. Emma something?

25:08.549 --> 25:09.884
Emma something.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.930
Yeah. You know,
I have a grant I need to write.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.181
- So, okay. yeah.
- Yeah.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.641
- Let's circle back around.
- Circle.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.935
- Yeah. Good talk.
- Great, great talk.

25:28.402 --> 25:32.698
<i>Most people glaze over
how many of you get this at parties</i>

25:32.698 --> 25:37.703
<i>when you start talking about muons
and stochastic models.</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:39.997
<i>It's difficult to understand.</i>

25:39.997 --> 25:41.874
<i>But what we do understand</i>

25:41.874 --> 25:47.171
<i>is that clean energy is the dream.</i>

25:47.171 --> 25:50.216
<i>But so far, it's either too expensive</i>

25:50.216 --> 25:53.719
<i>or you can't replicate the results.</i>

25:53.719 --> 25:58.474
<i>But it's right there,
across the chasm of ignorance</i>

25:58.474 --> 26:03.271
<i>and math is how we build the bridge.</i>

26:12.780 --> 26:15.241
Somebody was pre-gaming
in one of the stacks.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.662
I don't know what you want in here.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.165
People usually remove things
from the supply closet.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.499
- Yeah.
- Not put them in.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.753
Well, let's just say it's for Dr. Gray.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.463
Oh, okay.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.965
Excuse me?

27:54.965 --> 27:55.925
Oh...

27:56.550 --> 27:59.720
That's not yours.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.598
I'm, uh, terribly sorry.
I don't mean to pry.

28:02.598 --> 28:06.644
- Um, I'm Dr. Daniel Gray.
- I know exactly who you are, Dr. Gray.

28:06.644 --> 28:09.939
A thief. Thieves, all of you.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.820
What's that?

28:15.820 --> 28:18.531
Okay. So, Sophie is a method actress

28:18.531 --> 28:22.076
but there's no way to method your way
into a mastery of theoretical physics.

28:22.076 --> 28:25.079
So you are gonna have to talk her
through some of the finer points.

28:25.079 --> 28:28.082
You want me to talk to Dr. Gray for her?

28:28.624 --> 28:30.918
It's just an earpiece and a screen.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.045
They're just TV characters.
They're not real people.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.632
Okay, um...

28:36.632 --> 28:37.842
Alright.

28:39.301 --> 28:45.099
<i>Twenty years I've been trying to get
a traction because of peer review,</i>

28:45.808 --> 28:49.728
because my "so-called" peers
can't comprehend my math.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.272
Well, your work is radical.

28:51.981 --> 28:55.151
I mean, the standard model implies
that the energy required

28:55.151 --> 28:59.113
to create the necessary particles
is greater than the energy produced.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.907
But...

29:04.785 --> 29:07.037
- The standard model.
- <i>The standard model.</i>

29:07.037 --> 29:08.622
<i>Doesn't provide the evidence.</i>

29:08.622 --> 29:11.250
Does not provide the evidence that...

29:11.250 --> 29:14.336
- <i>But we can use a three-step</i>
- three-step...

29:14.336 --> 29:16.005
- proton
- proton...

29:16.005 --> 29:17.006
- <i>to pion,</i>
- pion...

29:17.006 --> 29:19.550
- <i>to muon accelerator.</i>
- to muon accelerator...

29:19.550 --> 29:20.843
To create a stable source.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.261
Can create a stable...

29:22.261 --> 29:24.221
- Source.
- Source.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.681
<i>My model explains</i>

29:25.681 --> 29:27.141
<i>- our observations</i> better.
- My model

29:27.141 --> 29:31.479
- explains our observations better.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

29:31.479 --> 29:33.981
But the establishment
is convinced it's right.

29:33.981 --> 29:37.026
The establishment
is still convinced it's right.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.862
<i>And the establishment</i>

29:39.862 --> 29:40.946
Well...

29:42.615 --> 29:47.495
it sometimes steals decades
of groundbreaking work.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.456
And all of your work is in there?

29:51.624 --> 29:53.459
And more.

29:53.459 --> 29:59.507
If you think that that first part
you stole is worth millions,

29:59.507 --> 30:03.594
then well, this second stage is worth...

30:07.389 --> 30:08.599
billions.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.142
Billions?

30:10.768 --> 30:14.522
Well, listen,
I swear I didn't steal anything, okay?

30:14.522 --> 30:16.357
It was a parallel development.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.235
But you know what that means?

30:21.362 --> 30:25.574
It means that one of the most famous
and respected scientists

30:25.574 --> 30:27.409
in the entire world...

30:29.620 --> 30:32.414
believes you,
hears you, knows you're right,

30:32.414 --> 30:33.999
and is willing to fight for you.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.502
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.923
But the establishment--

30:40.923 --> 30:42.299
I am the establishment.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.300
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.843
I can get it to work for you.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.806
Oh... Is it hot in here?

30:48.806 --> 30:50.307
It's a little warm.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.561
No. No, no, no.

30:53.561 --> 30:56.021
I already have a buyer interested.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.982
He's a very rich man.

30:57.982 --> 31:03.028
Well, wouldn't he be more likely to buy
with my name attached as your partner,

31:03.028 --> 31:06.865
your genius,
my respectability and genius.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.536
- It's a lot of genius.
- Oh, yes.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.662
Let me just take a look-see.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.706
- Oh, no.
- Just real quick.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.833
- Can I just...
- Oh, Dr. Gray, stop it.

31:15.833 --> 31:19.003
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Okay. Well, um...

31:19.795 --> 31:21.130
I should go.

31:21.130 --> 31:23.215
Yes. I've got--I've got to be getting on.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.842
Okay. Well...

31:27.136 --> 31:28.178
Thank you for stopping by.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.346
Yes. Well, think about it.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.689
Now all we need is someone to be
an eccentric tech billionaire.

31:38.689 --> 31:39.732
How do you do that?

31:39.732 --> 31:42.234
What is one weird thing
all tech billionaires do?

31:45.279 --> 31:48.949
Unlike other tech billionaires,
Musk, Brants, and Nash,

31:48.949 --> 31:52.077
Steven Finkel doesn't court publicity. No.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.831
He believes profoundly that only in space
can the planet's problems be solved.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.751
And that belief is so central
to MeteorInc's mission

31:58.751 --> 32:01.420
that he is leading by example.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.429
Oh.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.765
Hello, Mr. Finkel.

32:12.765 --> 32:15.517
Sorry to disturb
your seventh sunrise of the day.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.395
This is Dr. Williams and Dr. Gray.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.480
Hello.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.609
<i>Hey, the physicist. Yes, yes.</i>

32:23.609 --> 32:25.694
<i>I was excited to read your work.</i>

32:25.694 --> 32:27.571
<i>I didn't read your work. I'm very busy.</i>

32:27.571 --> 32:29.198
<i>But my people read your work.</i>

32:29.198 --> 32:31.617
<i>They said that your theorem
is quite amusing.</i>

32:31.617 --> 32:35.454
Mmm. It's not amusing.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.248
- How dare you.
- I found it funny myself.

32:38.248 --> 32:43.295
Yes. The way this math
just falls into place.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.547
<i>Mmm-hmm. Yeah. See...</i>

32:45.547 --> 32:49.593
<i>I'm building a freeway
to space for future generations</i>

32:49.593 --> 32:52.346
<i>but a metaphorical one,
not a real one...</i>

32:52.346 --> 32:55.766
<i>A real one could be possible though
with some lightweight concrete.</i>

32:55.766 --> 32:57.726
-<i>Reagan, make a note.</i>
- Making a note.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.396
<i>Invest in lightweight concrete development.</i>

33:00.396 --> 33:04.024
<i>So this theorem of yours,
how does it help me?</i>

33:04.024 --> 33:06.568
<i>How does it help the world?</i>

33:06.568 --> 33:09.822
Right. So based on my research...

33:09.822 --> 33:12.241
um, our research,

33:12.241 --> 33:14.451
um, there are broader implications.

33:14.451 --> 33:15.911
<i>Uh, which are?</i>

33:20.457 --> 33:23.961
Oh. Oh, oh, oh. [chuckles] Oh.

33:23.961 --> 33:29.883
Basically it relates to low energy
nuclear reactors.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.470
- LENR. You mean cold fusion?
- Mmm.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.848
<i>Uh, Dr. Gray, you seem surprised.</i>

33:35.848 --> 33:38.559
No, sorry.
A bug went down my throat I think.

33:38.559 --> 33:39.560
<i>Uh, Reagan, make a note.</i>

33:39.560 --> 33:40.853
<i>Get Dr. Gray some water.</i>

33:40.853 --> 33:42.396
Of course.

33:42.396 --> 33:43.731
I'm fine. Really.

33:43.731 --> 33:47.693
<i>Low energy nuclear reactions
is quasi science.</i>

33:47.693 --> 33:51.572
No, it's just that we--the research
hasn't had an organizing principle.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.991
Well, the Gray theorem
is that organizing principle.

33:53.991 --> 33:57.953
Um, Okay. Low energy nuclear reactions
can power everything,

33:57.953 --> 34:00.956
from your watch to your city.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.792
Yes. And...!

34:03.792 --> 34:07.546
Also stop climate change
and the burning of fossil fuels.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.506
Yeah, to a rocket.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.926
Okay. You wanna build
a freeway to space, this is how.

34:12.926 --> 34:16.638
<i>It seems I like it. I love it. I want it.</i>

34:17.723 --> 34:20.350
-<i>Yes.</i>
- Yes. You won't regret this.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.937
<i>Just one problem. Dr. Gray,
you publish with the university,</i>

34:23.937 --> 34:25.856
<i>which means that they own
half the patent.</i>

34:25.856 --> 34:28.859
<i>Which means they own half the discovery,
I don't like to share.</i>

34:28.859 --> 34:31.779
<i>Dr. Williams though, you, [chuckles]</i>

34:31.779 --> 34:33.614
<i>you're not affiliated
with any institution,</i>

34:33.614 --> 34:37.910
<i>so we would love to present you
with a two-comma deal, great bennies--</i>

34:37.910 --> 34:39.244
I can resign.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.079
-<i>Resign?</i>
- Resign?

34:41.079 --> 34:44.875
Yeah. I'll put in my notice at school,
tell them it's for personal reasons.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.920
Anything I develop after that,
they won't have a piece of.

34:48.879 --> 34:53.175
<i>Uh, I mean, is it--it's risky.</i>

34:53.175 --> 34:58.013
<i>Guess I could call a special session
of the board to present your work</i>

34:58.013 --> 35:01.892
<i>and we can make a deal
after you resign of course.</i>

35:01.892 --> 35:03.769
Oh, Daniel,

35:03.769 --> 35:06.188
you'd give up your position...

35:07.856 --> 35:09.316
for science.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.609
Yes.

35:11.777 --> 35:12.986
For science.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.321
Oh.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.240
<i>Yes, for science.</i>

35:16.240 --> 35:18.116
Oh, sorry.

35:19.409 --> 35:22.579
Ooh, you look like the cat post-canary.

35:22.579 --> 35:26.333
Just waiting for the call to confirm
that Dr. Gray has resigned

35:26.333 --> 35:30.462
and then we slam him
with the plagiarism and go public.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.382
Breanna has a big social media
campaign plan.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.050
And these bots want blood.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.100
Meow. Rrr.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.811
Hello.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.397
Dr. Williams. Great news.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.857
<i>Hmm, let me guess.</i>

35:49.857 --> 35:52.985
You're free of your university
responsibilities?

35:52.985 --> 35:54.403
<i>Oh, even better.</i>

35:54.403 --> 35:55.779
<i>You know, the offer from Finkel</i>

35:55.779 --> 35:58.240
convinced me that I've got
a real treasure on my hands.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.492
Darren Nash. Welcome back, sir.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.327
It is good to be back, sir.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.620
Indeed it is.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.580
Let's take a look at
the facilities.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.914
I found another buyer.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.010
I found another buyer. Darren Nash.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.595
Finally had reason
to return my phone call.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.972
<i>It's millions for the school's endowment,</i>

36:21.972 --> 36:24.182
more money than I could spend
in three lifetimes.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.603
And a next-gen physics facility
named after me.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.023
Well, I'm itching to meet him.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.941
<i>Oh. No, you misunderstand.</i>

36:32.941 --> 36:34.192
I don't need you.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.820
You will when you try to explain

36:36.820 --> 36:39.698
the mathematics behind the concepts
that I'm trying to sell you.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.993
<i>Nash will think you're
a complete idiot if I'm not there.</i>

36:42.993 --> 36:45.913
No, Dr. Williams, you don't get it.

36:45.913 --> 36:47.039
You're a nobody.

36:47.039 --> 36:49.207
<i>Nobodies don't
make discoveries like this.</i>

36:49.207 --> 36:51.293
<i>I'm a scientific genius.</i>

36:51.293 --> 36:54.546
And in another hour, anyone in this field
who doesn't already know that

36:54.546 --> 36:56.465
won't have any reason left to doubt it.

36:57.174 --> 37:00.302
Nash doesn't need me
to explain the math.

37:00.302 --> 37:03.347
Okay. Tech billionaires buy concepts...

37:03.347 --> 37:04.932
from people like me,

37:04.932 --> 37:07.476
<i>not people like you.</i>

37:07.476 --> 37:08.477
Rude.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.520
I thought we had a connection.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.231
- So how are we gonna stop this deal?
- You heard him.

37:13.231 --> 37:18.946
If Gray doesn't try and explain the math,
then there's an opening for Emma.

37:18.946 --> 37:21.281
We need Emma in the same room
as Darren Nash.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.617
While he's being glad-handed
by the Dean and Gray?

37:23.617 --> 37:25.160
Billionaires have security,

37:25.160 --> 37:27.245
the expensive-not-messing-around
security.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.123
Sounds like we're gonna break
into something for once.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.793
You know, Hardison got me
a new grappling hook for Christmas.

37:32.793 --> 37:35.629
It's time for this bad boy
to come out and play.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.716
Um, is Emma even gonna be able to talk
to Nash?

37:39.716 --> 37:44.638
Mmm-hmm.
One impossibility at a time, please.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.475
Emma, we've got to go now quick.

37:48.475 --> 37:49.476
What is it?

37:49.476 --> 37:51.186
Gray's about to sell your work
to Darren Nash

37:51.186 --> 37:52.729
and we need you there
to prove that he stole it.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.147
What? No, I, I can't.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.774
You're the only one that can explain
this research.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.858
I've seen you do it before.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.777
You have no idea
how impressive you are.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.028
No, but I can't.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.532
I'll freeze up again in front of Gray
and the Dean and Darren Nash?

38:03.532 --> 38:07.411
Okay. Emma, you can.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.497
You can. Okay? It's now or never.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.708
Okay.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.335
If we build near the student union,

38:15.335 --> 38:18.630
it would brand the physics department
the academic core of the university.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.340
Yes. Yes, indeed.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.093
Business manager calling from Fiji
or attorney calling from Aspen?

38:23.093 --> 38:25.012
Oh.

38:25.012 --> 38:27.931
Yo, dawg. How are the slopes?

38:27.931 --> 38:29.307
Oh, this was Fiji.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.602
Yo, dawg, how are the...

38:34.271 --> 38:36.481
we lost Aspen.
Nadia, take over phones.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.483
I'm trying to keep you
from making a huge mistake.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.277
There's been no mistake.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.655
You are meddling
with our university's future here.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.949
I've been in this business
a long time, Harry.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.743
This is how progress is made.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.287
Trust me, you're standing in the way
of progress this time.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.749
How am I standing in the way of progress?

38:53.749 --> 38:55.167
What's going on?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.044
The bean-counters.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.712
Science and money do not mix,
am I right, doctor?

39:00.422 --> 39:02.799
So tell me, how did you come up
with the idea

39:02.799 --> 39:05.677
for a deep dive
into muon extreme generation?

39:05.677 --> 39:09.765
Um, yeah, you know,
the usual ways that you do.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.892
The best ideas come from "anywhere".

39:11.892 --> 39:13.393
Isn't that what you always say?

39:13.393 --> 39:15.187
Uh, no, from anyone.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.105
- That's the approach I take.
- Yes.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.941
We don't know who is going to upset
the established order of today

39:19.941 --> 39:21.693
with the revolution of tomorrow.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.246
They're all working together,
the three of them.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.373
Dr. Williams, the lawyer,

39:36.500 --> 39:37.417
and that janitor.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.296
They're trying to steal
the research from my paper.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.465
This is corporate espionage is what it is.

39:43.465 --> 39:44.883
They're working for Klesco.

39:46.927 --> 39:47.969
You know what?

39:47.969 --> 39:49.137
let's bring this up to my office.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.057
I--yeah, I just think we're gonna have
a fewer distractions up there.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.017
- What do you say? Okay. Yeah.
- All right.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.268
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.316
Gray's on his way back to his office.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.151
They're finalizing the deal.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.903
We need a distraction.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.322
Eliot, how long will it take you
to get us through those guards?

40:08.865 --> 40:10.367
I got an idea.

40:10.367 --> 40:13.745
Parker, you and your grappling hook
are about to be very happy.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.665
You guys head over.
Butterfly, this is Caterpillar. Come in.

40:18.834 --> 40:19.835
Come on.

40:28.802 --> 40:33.181
This first page here, I'm...

40:33.181 --> 40:36.309
This is--I'm so sorry.
Give me one sec.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.855
- You.
- Hey.

40:39.855 --> 40:40.939
How'd you get in here?

40:40.939 --> 40:43.024
What, you didn't get the memo?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.527
This has been on your calendar
for three weeks.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.529
Oh.

40:47.529 --> 40:48.738
This thing has a mind of its own.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.657
Coming in hot.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.409
No.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.244
- I know what you're up to.
- What?

40:54.244 --> 40:57.414
Yeah. You will not get away with this!

40:57.414 --> 40:58.957
You will not get away with this.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.466
Excuse me!

41:12.137 --> 41:15.265
Darren, Dean, we have to go.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.600
We'll find another room.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.728
Yeah. It'll be great. Yeah. Come on.
Yeah, just come with me.

41:19.728 --> 41:21.062
It's gonna be awesome.

41:22.856 --> 41:25.066
It's kind of fun. Come on.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.943
Yeah. We're just gonna find
another room.

41:26.943 --> 41:30.739
We're good. Private.

41:34.034 --> 41:37.037
They're painting in here today
and the fumes are out of control.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.498
Um, okay. Uh, Thank you.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.917
Let's head on down here.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.669
I'm on a pretty tight schedule.

41:44.669 --> 41:45.962
We'll find a place.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.757
It's a big building
so, you know, lots of...

41:48.757 --> 41:50.217
here we go.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.803
That's still locked.

41:53.803 --> 41:58.725
You think I'd get a master key but I--
they just--this one?

41:58.725 --> 42:01.811
Look, nasty sulfur accident, doctor.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.480
It's all over the place.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.731
Give us an hour or two.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.024
Um... hour or two.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.194
Okay. Yeah. You know what, guys,
let's head on down this way.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.905
Maybe we should reschedule this, Gray.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.573
No, no, everything's fine.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.119
It's right down here.

42:18.119 --> 42:20.580
They're locking down
the entire hall for waxing.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.623
For waxing?

42:21.623 --> 42:23.083
Waxing.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.209
No, no, no.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.797
I don't know why there's just no--

42:28.797 --> 42:30.966
excuse me, can I just get in here?

42:30.966 --> 42:31.883
Really?

42:31.883 --> 42:32.968
- I may have to rethink this deal.
- Okay. All right.

42:32.968 --> 42:35.762
One of these has gotta be open.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.138
- Okay.
- Dr. Gray.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.599
- Dr. Gray. Okay. So I was wondering...
- No.

42:39.599 --> 42:40.725
- if now would be a good time for you...
- This isn't going to work.

42:40.725 --> 42:41.726
...to read the first chapter
of my dissertation.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.894
We'll get the elevator.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.479
- Oh, well, okay. Wait. Guys.
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

42:44.479 --> 42:45.647
It's a little long, it's a little long.

42:45.647 --> 42:46.982
- I just do not know what to cut.
- All right. Okay. Well...

42:46.982 --> 42:48.400
Thank you, Nadia.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.443
Okay. You'd have to--
maybe next week or--

42:50.443 --> 42:53.154
I just need--Emma Camore.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.073
Emma Camore,
someone stop that woman.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.075
No, don't let her talk to Nash.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.618
Security. Someone.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.453
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:01.538 --> 43:04.165
Help! Security. No, no, no, wait.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.923
You know, I'm almost glad
you came back, Emma.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.801
This time I get to escort you
out of the building myself.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.142
Too presumptuous by half, Emma.

43:22.142 --> 43:23.268
Trying to take what's mine.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.728
You're the thief, Gray.

43:24.728 --> 43:28.106
- And a pretty bad scientist too.
- Hey.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.649
Safety first.

43:29.649 --> 43:31.735
Oh. Hey.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.199
What do we do now?
We missed our chance.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.410
No, no, just the Plan A and B.

43:40.410 --> 43:42.287
But we still have Plan C.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.750
Come on. I have control of the elevator.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.377
So...

43:50.754 --> 43:54.674
billionaire with a B.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.426
What's that like?

44:04.476 --> 44:05.477
Parker.

44:07.354 --> 44:10.899
This feels more like Plan G,
for grappling hook.

44:10.899 --> 44:12.984
- Uh, what are we doing?
- Oh, just step inside

44:12.984 --> 44:17.155
and focus on your breathing
and tell them everything you know.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.156
You can do this, Emma.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.325
Okay. This is gonna sound
a little bit weird, right?

44:20.325 --> 44:22.702
But this is how my people taught me
to show affection.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.331
- Oh, oh. Ooh!
- You'll be fine.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.041
Breanna!

44:29.250 --> 44:31.669
Oh, I'm so sorry. This...

44:31.669 --> 44:32.962
Ow, ow.

44:32.962 --> 44:34.839
- You heard that?
- I did.

44:39.052 --> 44:40.929
Oh, hold on.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.723
I'm stuck. Oh, one second.

44:45.809 --> 44:47.394
What is the meaning of this?

44:49.354 --> 44:51.022
I'm Emma Camore,

44:51.022 --> 44:52.690
the author of the theorem Dr. Gray stole.

44:54.234 --> 44:55.110
And I can prove it.

44:57.487 --> 44:59.989
I need a marker.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.032
Oh.

45:02.492 --> 45:04.411
Okay.

45:08.164 --> 45:10.917
Getting my PhD doing research,

45:10.917 --> 45:13.044
it's all I've ever wanted.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.839
Start with your average
hydrogen electron cloud.

45:15.839 --> 45:19.426
Emma, you can. You can.

45:20.635 --> 45:21.928
- Uh...
- No, no, no.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.264
Go on, please.

45:24.264 --> 45:26.516
Okay. It's now or never.

45:26.516 --> 45:29.477
Okay. So--okay. So you start with...

45:38.611 --> 45:41.239
- You.
- Just waiting on the elevator.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.410
Oh, and here it is, right on time.

45:46.578 --> 45:50.373
So you reached your conclusion
via these derivations.

45:52.459 --> 45:55.253
- It's brilliant.
- Darren, Darren.

45:55.253 --> 45:58.256
What are you--okay.
She's a liar.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.758
A poor misguided student
who thinks she's smarter than she is.

46:01.176 --> 46:03.178
I just didn't think anyone
would believe me...

46:03.178 --> 46:04.596
or want to.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.932
People like you only listen
to people like him.

46:07.932 --> 46:11.769
This girl is even smarter
than she thinks she is.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.481
And you know what I remember
from your class, Dr. Gray?

46:14.481 --> 46:17.609
That when you didn't know
the answer to a question, you'd lie.

46:17.609 --> 46:20.028
I'm sorry, Dean,
but you just can't get this deal done

46:20.028 --> 46:21.112
backing the wrong horse.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.282
And I don't think that Darren Nash,
famed tech genius,

46:24.282 --> 46:27.327
is gonna wanna invest
a hundred million dollars in a school

46:27.327 --> 46:30.872
that allows a professor
to steal from a student.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.207
Neither do I.

46:32.207 --> 46:34.876
Well, Mr. Nash...

46:34.876 --> 46:36.002
Darren,

46:36.002 --> 46:39.881
of course we abhor the idea
that poor Emma was stolen from.

46:39.881 --> 46:42.800
We will be taking immediate action
to address this.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.303
- Um, first of all, I have tenure.
- Oh, gosh.

46:45.303 --> 46:48.306
If only we had some kind
of irrefutable evidence about the theft

46:48.306 --> 46:51.684
that would cancel that tenure
and maybe even cost you your job,

46:51.684 --> 46:54.771
and your reputation and even bring
formal charges against you.

46:54.771 --> 46:56.731
Oh ho, ho, ho, look at that.

46:56.731 --> 46:59.150
Ooh. Look at that.

46:59.859 --> 47:03.530
Ooh! I bet that's Emma's
original hard drive

47:03.530 --> 47:07.867
and her notes dating back years
on the project,

47:07.867 --> 47:11.621
all in the hands
of a very competent lawyer.

47:14.249 --> 47:16.709
You know, I think you might need
a bigger elevator.

47:16.709 --> 47:18.920
You have some work to do.

47:20.213 --> 47:21.714
Thank you so much.

47:22.423 --> 47:23.341
- Darren.
- Uh...

47:23.341 --> 47:24.342
Thank you.

47:26.553 --> 47:27.595
Emma, lovely work.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.264
Please tell me more about the original...

47:29.264 --> 47:30.515
- Harry.
- Mmm.

47:30.515 --> 47:33.142
Perhaps we should talk about
that hearing you requested now.

47:33.142 --> 47:36.354
- Mmm.
- Dean. Dean. Okay. Dean?

47:38.565 --> 47:42.277
You know how it is, you know,
the pressure. "Publish or perish."

47:42.277 --> 47:43.444
- You can't do this--
- Daniel,

47:44.821 --> 47:46.781
I'd start clearing my office.

47:46.990 --> 47:47.865
Campus security--

47:47.865 --> 47:50.702
Oh, campus security is already here, Dean.

47:51.286 --> 47:54.205
I'm sure they'd be more than happy
to help you with whatever you need.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.668
Excuse me.

48:00.336 --> 48:01.504
Dean, it...

48:06.009 --> 48:08.511
So is now a good time for you
to read through my dissertation?

48:08.511 --> 48:10.138
No? Okay.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.229
You had my back there,
didn't you, Floyd?

48:18.229 --> 48:19.564
Well, you mess with one of us,

48:19.564 --> 48:21.024
you mess with all of us.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.234
I have something for you.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.200
You don't really work here, do you?

48:32.452 --> 48:34.787
Let's just say I'm off to another job.

48:34.787 --> 48:35.788
Thank you--

48:35.788 --> 48:38.041
No. You take that with you,

48:38.041 --> 48:39.375
New Blood.

48:40.001 --> 48:41.711
You ain't done fixing things.

48:48.468 --> 48:50.595
All right. Let's go get a beer.

48:50.595 --> 48:53.598
- Hey. No, I'm still on the clock.
- Still on the...

48:54.515 --> 48:57.060
No, I admit it, I was as little worried

48:57.060 --> 49:02.106
but I think Emma really pulled off
her elevator pitch. Ooh.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.484
Yeah, she just needed a little shove.

49:05.401 --> 49:07.654
Okay. That's a good one.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.155
You...

49:09.155 --> 49:11.407
You fit in here better
than I thought you would.

49:11.407 --> 49:12.867
I know.

49:12.867 --> 49:16.871
I mean, higher education
obviously has some major issues

49:16.871 --> 49:18.998
but I kind of liked it here,

49:18.998 --> 49:21.751
around people like Emma,
who just wanna learn.

49:24.295 --> 49:26.547
You do know that your path isn't
everyone's path

49:26.547 --> 49:28.758
and that the path
that you're currently on

49:28.758 --> 49:31.010
doesn't have to be forever, right?

49:31.010 --> 49:34.514
Every member of this crew has
changed their life at some point.

49:34.514 --> 49:35.640
The world is vast.

49:36.391 --> 49:37.892
You do have choices.

49:39.227 --> 49:40.186
I don't know.

49:40.186 --> 49:43.648
Maybe taking a class or two
wouldn't be the worst thing.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.024
Just please do not tell Harry

49:45.024 --> 49:47.026
because I do not wanna learn
about ultimate frisbee.

49:47.026 --> 49:49.987
Oh, no, please. Don't put that in my head.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.448
I don't wanna picture him
in those distressing little shorts.

49:52.448 --> 49:53.658
And that headband? Ohh.

49:53.658 --> 49:56.536
Actually, I kind of do wanna see him
in a headband.
