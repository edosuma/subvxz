Heffer, what are
you doing here?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.901
I've been watching you sleep.

01:49.984 --> 01:50.902
You're weird.

I'm weird?

Good morning, Spunky.

Tapeworm!

02:29.149 --> 02:32.360
Oh, no, look out.
It's got us for sure.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.727
(whines)

03:47.810 --> 03:50.813
Okay, sit up.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.981
{\an1}Play dead.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.861
Okay, bend the spoon

Now, now, Spunky.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.833
{\an1}No Fatheads brand chewable
vitamin cheese tablets for you.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.752
Can't he have just one?

04:12.835 --> 04:14.128
Are you kidding?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.214
You can't give pets
Fatheads cheese chewables.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.216
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.593
And why was that?

04:22.178 --> 04:25.473
{\an1}Don't you remember, a couple
of years ago at Granny's,

04:25.556 --> 04:28.267
somebody gave a Fatheads
chewable to the cat?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.939
Well, w-w-what happened?

04:33.022 --> 04:36.109
Well, 19 minutes
later, blammo!

04:36.192 --> 04:38.528
She exploded.
How could you forget that?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.405
Hmm...

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
Who's that?

04:42.407 --> 04:45.618
(belching and whining)

04:45.702 --> 04:46.953
Heffer!

04:48.663 --> 04:51.624

04:51.708 --> 04:54.127
Heffer! How could you
forget about the cat?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.254
I'll boil some water!

04:58.089 --> 05:00.466
And up ahead,
on our left...

05:00.550 --> 05:01.759
(screaming)

05:01.843 --> 05:03.928
(hacking)

05:04.012 --> 05:07.056
(screaming continues)

05:09.183 --> 05:13.312
{\an1}Okay, Spunky, hang on.
They're time-release tablets!

05:13.396 --> 05:15.148
{\an1}We've got to get you
to the vet

05:15.231 --> 05:17.191
{\an1}and we've got less
than 19 minutes!

05:19.068 --> 05:22.113
Squirmy!

05:22.196 --> 05:25.658
Squirmy!

05:25.742 --> 05:27.243
(gasps)

05:27.326 --> 05:28.745
Squirmy!

05:35.126 --> 05:36.335
You're alive.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.796
{\an1}Great idea.
Stupid lame ride.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.591
(laughing)

05:41.674 --> 05:43.342
{\an1}All right!
That's enough.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.094
Hey, lighten up.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.387
That was some hiccup, huh?

05:46.471 --> 05:49.599
Had to be at least
a 7.1 on the--

05:49.682 --> 05:52.018
{\an3}Wha...
Holy...

05:52.101 --> 05:54.645
(both inhaling deeply)

05:58.316 --> 06:00.109
What do you think it is?

06:00.193 --> 06:04.155
It's so beautiful.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.616
The idiots are alive.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.451
They'll want to share
in my discovery.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.120
Well, hello,
glad to see you.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.956
Have you ever seen
anything like it?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.833
Ha.
Pretty nifty, eh?

06:15.917 --> 06:19.087
{\an1}Nifty? We could make a fortune
exhibiting this thing.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.297
{\an1}"The Colossus
of the Ancients."

06:21.380 --> 06:22.882
{\an1}People go nuts
for that kind of thing.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.133
Yeah, they do, don't they?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
Why don't you go see

06:25.968 --> 06:27.762
what condition
the boat is in, huh?

06:27.845 --> 06:30.306
{\an5}Aye-aye, cap'n!

06:27.845 --> 06:30.306
Aye-aye, cap'n!

06:31.808 --> 06:32.892
Idiots.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.729
They have no idea
how valuable this is.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.939
My beauty.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.358
You are going to make me
a fortune.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.945

06:44.028 --> 06:45.905
Hmm.
Citrus.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.162
Do you hear something?

06:55.289 --> 06:57.583
{\an5}Hello?

06:55.289 --> 06:57.583
Yoohoo!
Hello?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.335
Hey, fella!

06:59.418 --> 07:00.962
That's weird.
He's gone.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.841
{\an1}Maybe the--
the thing is cursed!

07:04.924 --> 07:06.342
Aww, curse phooey!

07:06.425 --> 07:08.344
This thing can
make us a fortune.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.595
Right, pal!

07:09.679 --> 07:11.722
(cat meowing, sheep bleating)

07:11.806 --> 07:13.850
All right.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.810
I've looked your pet
over thoroughly.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.770
Is she gonna be okay, Doc?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.898
{\an1}Well, I don't know how to
tell you this, Mr. Filburt.

07:20.982 --> 07:25.111
That's, uh, not a she.
That's a loaf of bread.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.864
{\an1}No.
She moved yesterday.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
{\an1}Don't listen to him, Margaret.
You'll be fine.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.076
I'm afraid we...

07:32.160 --> 07:33.369
have to take that
from you.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.663
{\an1}No!

07:38.332 --> 07:41.544
Look what I've got.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.004
Woo!

07:44.630 --> 07:46.924
Sauce...

07:48.885 --> 07:51.721
Muah, muah, muah, muah, muah...

07:57.059 --> 07:58.769
Sorry, Filburt,
I'll replace it.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.731

a Fatheads

08:04.066 --> 08:05.401
chewable vitamin
cheese tablet, huh?

08:05.484 --> 08:06.527

you know.

{\an3}(slurping)

08:09.864 --> 08:11.782

08:11.866 --> 08:12.742
Heffer!

08:12.825 --> 08:15.119
Well, I tell you what.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.662
Let's cut him open!

08:18.623 --> 08:19.707
I'm just kidding.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.252
First, a little test.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.172
Here, Spunky, here.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.798
Open your mouth.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.508
That a boy...

08:36.765 --> 08:38.392
Excellent score.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.647
Ladies and gentlemen,
for centuries,

08:42.730 --> 08:45.816
this colossal beauty has gazed
across time,

08:45.900 --> 08:48.527
her origins unknown.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.780
Undoubtedly, the ancients
constructed her

08:50.863 --> 08:53.741
for some profound
mystic purpose.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.452
And for 5 bucks a pop, you can
have your picture taken with it.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.120
(grumbling)

08:58.204 --> 09:00.206
No way.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.041
Well, what's the problem?

09:02.124 --> 09:04.001
{\an1}I don't know.
Nobody gives a hoot.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.796
Know what we need?
A hook.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.673
Something like...

09:21.185 --> 09:23.312
Greed. Greed is what I call it,

09:23.396 --> 09:25.398
and I think the bugs
of this community

09:25.481 --> 09:27.608
have had enough
of watching those two.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.200
(both gasp)

09:41.706 --> 09:43.291
(both)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:44.292 --> 09:47.253
{\an1}What was that?
He can't be going off yet.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.629
{\an4}Hmm.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.629
(watch ticking)

09:48.713 --> 09:49.630
{\an1}No.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.384
There's still time left.

09:53.467 --> 09:57.054
{\an1}Shall I run the register
this morning, Mr. Bloatman?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.682
{\an1}As you wish, Mr. Mix--
Worm!

09:59.765 --> 10:00.641
Bloatman!

10:00.725 --> 10:01.934
Uh-oh!

10:00.725 --> 10:01.934
Uh-oh!

10:02.018 --> 10:03.561
What gives you the right

10:03.644 --> 10:06.105
to keep immortality
to yourselves?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.190
To charge us admission?

10:08.274 --> 10:11.110
We have come
to take what's ours!

10:11.193 --> 10:12.903
You can't keep it from us!

10:12.987 --> 10:13.904
Yeah!

10:12.987 --> 10:13.904
{\an1}Yeah!

10:13.988 --> 10:16.365
Quick, say something
meaningful.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.492
Everyone, please!

10:18.576 --> 10:21.412
Listen to yourselves.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.248
Is this what we've become?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.250
A bunch of savages?

10:26.334 --> 10:30.338
We don't even know what this is
we're dealing with here.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.427
I think I got
through to 'em.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.804
(yelling)

10:44.393 --> 10:46.437
My gosh.
What have we done?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.272
{\an3}(echoing)

10:49.482 --> 10:53.486
What have we here?
Here's the problem.

10:53.569 --> 10:58.074
{\an1}That vitamin we were looking
for was in his ear all the time.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.951
Great, uh...
What does that mean?

11:01.035 --> 11:05.831
{\an1}It means good ol' Spunky here
is gonna be a mommy.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.709
But Spunky's a boy dog.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.960
Oh.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.295
Then, uh...

11:11.379 --> 11:13.297
I guess it means Spunky's fine.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.010
{\an1}Hit the deck!
She's gonna blow!

11:20.096 --> 11:22.098

Yep.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.505
Purvis, the world's fattest
rattlesnake.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.594
And Flemm rock.
What a sight!

12:41.677 --> 12:44.430
One day, I'm gonna take a trip
out to see Flemm Rock.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.224
Did you say Flemm Rock?

12:47.308 --> 12:47.725
{\an1}Yeah, why?

12:47.808 --> 12:48.851
I think it's on TV.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.354
<i>Flemm Rock, once America's</i>
<i>favorite tourist trap</i>

12:52.438 --> 12:55.274
<i>now faces destruction.</i>

12:55.357 --> 12:57.860
{\an8}<i>Hailed as one of</i>
<i>the ten wonders of the world,</i>

12:57.943 --> 12:59.653
{\an8}<i>by renowned outdoorsman</i>
<i>Yukon Sheldon,</i>

12:59.737 --> 13:02.698
{\an8}<i>shown here becoming</i>
<i>the first and only man</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:05.868
{\an8}<i>to scale the treacherous face</i>
<i>of Flemm Rock...</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:05.868
{\an5}<i>(screams)</i>

13:05.951 --> 13:09.914
<i>named for the green algae-rich</i>
<i>waters that flow through it.</i>

13:09.997 --> 13:12.541
<i>But in recent years,</i>
<i>attendance has dropped</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:16.170
<i>and Flemm Rock</i>
<i>has fallen into disrepair.</i>

13:16.253 --> 13:18.214
<i>It will be</i>
<i>unceremoniously leveled</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:21.717
<i>after its final eruption</i>
<i>this Friday.</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:25.930
{\an1}Oh, man, we gotta see it
before it's destroyed!

13:26.013 --> 13:28.516
Heff, Flemm Rock
is a long way away.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.225
No problem.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.559
We'll road trip.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.479
Heff, where'd you get
the motorcycle?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.940
I saved my snack money
for a whole week.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.024
I don't know, Heff.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.234
Listen, Rocko.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.735
{\an1}This country's heart
is fading away.

13:39.818 --> 13:43.739
{\an1}Soon the roadside café
and the tacky tourist trap

13:43.822 --> 13:47.910
will be relics of the past, like
drive-in movies and mood rings.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.578
{\an1}This could be our last chance
to experience

13:49.662 --> 13:51.914
{\an1}this country's
cheesy attractions,

13:51.997 --> 13:55.709
{\an1}while we're still naïve enough
to be awed by them.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.504
So let's hit the road

13:58.587 --> 14:01.924
like the greatest road trippers
of all time,

14:02.007 --> 14:04.260
guys like Jack Kerouac,

14:04.343 --> 14:08.639
the Greasy Riders,
Peter Fondue...

14:08.722 --> 14:09.932
And that other guy.

14:10.015 --> 14:16.021
It's not just a fun idea, Rock.
It's our patriotic duty!

14:17.314 --> 14:19.942
Uh, excuse me.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.945
{\an1}How do I get
to O-Town Flag Emporium?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.822
Three blocks down,
make a left.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.657
Well, you know, I've always
wanted to see this country.

14:26.740 --> 14:31.287
That's the spirit, Rock!
Let's ride!

14:31.370 --> 14:33.747
♪♪

14:46.385 --> 14:48.804
Hey, Rocko, how
about some driving music?

14:48.887 --> 14:49.680
{\an1}Sure.
What is it?

14:49.763 --> 14:52.891
Most loved disco hits
of the '70s

14:52.975 --> 14:57.771
as played by the McThrifty
Brothers Bagpipe Band.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.107
♪ Huh huh huh huh ♪

15:00.190 --> 15:00.608
♪ Stayin' alive! ♪

15:00.691 --> 15:03.110

15:05.738 --> 15:07.323
{\an1}(Rocko)
500 miles, Heff.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.658
Wait, I think
I found a shortcut.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.493
Turn left up here.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.708
Turn right at Stonehenge.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.505
(religious singing)

15:24.923 --> 15:25.966
Hmm...

15:26.050 --> 15:28.385
I think it's this way.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.182
Uh, Heff?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.309
We're almost there!

15:35.392 --> 15:38.437
(speaking rapidly
in foreign language)

15:40.272 --> 15:43.025
And ta-da!
We're back on the road.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.694
We must have cut hours
off our trip.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.488
{\an1}Are you sure you're reading
that thing right?

15:47.571 --> 15:49.073
{\an3}Well, I...

15:49.156 --> 15:50.866
{\an3}Uh...

15:50.949 --> 15:53.744
Maybe we'd better
ask directions.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.247
{\an3}Flemm Rock?

15:57.331 --> 15:59.750
Well, first, you gotta
go back five or ten miles

15:59.833 --> 16:03.545
'til you get
to a big purple shed

16:03.629 --> 16:06.382
with Rufus painted
on the side.

16:06.465 --> 16:11.387
You take the dirt road
just past that shed.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.639
Don't go too far.
Just a little bit past it.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.308
If you see another shed

16:16.392 --> 16:19.061
that has Chaka Khan
painted on the side,

16:19.144 --> 16:20.604
then you've gone too far.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.066
{\an1}Go back to the previous shed,
there's two of 'em,

16:24.149 --> 16:27.111
and it can be confusing
for somebody

16:27.194 --> 16:28.654
that's not familiar
with the area.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.740
Why, I remember
last February,

16:31.824 --> 16:35.077
I was driving that road
with my friend Fur.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.705
Fur weren't his real name,
of course.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.499
His real name was Frank.

16:40.582 --> 16:44.586
Real name was Frank,
but we called him "Fur."

16:44.670 --> 16:46.588
Isn't that crazy?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.216
He knew where to get
the best beef jerky

16:49.299 --> 16:50.217
that I have ever tasted.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.928
{\an1}And every time he came to town,
I would tell him,

16:53.011 --> 16:56.807
{\an1}Fur, bring some
of that beef jerky with you.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.351
Wouldn't you know
that last time...

16:59.435 --> 17:02.104
I think we should go find
a place to stay the night.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.731
...beef jerky.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.775
I said, you idiot,
you get out of here

17:06.858 --> 17:10.487
{\an1}and don't come back
until you have the beef jerky!

17:10.570 --> 17:11.946
{\an3}Ha ha!

17:12.030 --> 17:14.992
Heff, do you think you could
turn off that bagpipe music?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.367
It's getting a bit irritating.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.621
I can't, the tape
is stuck in the machine.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.749
And the volume knob
came off.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.792
(woman screams)

17:24.877 --> 17:29.506
Oh, yes.
We have a vacancy.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.635
And we have showers
in all the rooms.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.472
What's that?
Will you excuse me?

17:36.555 --> 17:39.266
Coming, mother!

17:39.349 --> 17:40.642
{\an1}Heff, maybe we should
try somewhere else.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.312
Yeah, sure.
There must be dozens

17:43.395 --> 17:46.523
of quality establishments
along this road.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.572
{\an4}(Rocko)
Heff, I don't know
if I can handle this music

17:53.655 --> 17:54.656
all the way to Flemm Rock.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.117
It's not much further, Rock.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.841
Stop it!

18:12.925 --> 18:13.550
Stop it!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.135
What's wrong, Rocko?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.808
I'm going to stop
that infernal racket right now!

18:23.477 --> 18:25.896
{\an1}Careful, Rock!
You're warping the tank!

18:25.979 --> 18:27.981
How can you tell?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.277
{\an1}Hey, Rock,
I'm gonna get a bite to eat.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.237
Holler if you need me.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.200
I'm starving.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.701
What's the biggest thing
on the menu?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.663
{\an1}That would be our knockwurst
nightmare platter.

18:42.746 --> 18:46.583
{\an1}570 pounds of ground pig parts
packed tightly but tantalizingly

18:46.667 --> 18:49.253
{\an1}into over two miles
of intestinal tubing.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.213
{\an1}No one has ever finished
the nightmare platter.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.548
I'll take two.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.882
{\an1}There aren't enough pigs
in the country, sir.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.928
Mmm, how about one
and a side of fries?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.099
Mmm, pig parts!

19:02.182 --> 19:03.183
(breathing heavily,
music subsides)

19:07.980 --> 19:09.898
Well, I stopped the tape,

19:09.982 --> 19:13.110
{\an1}but I'm afraid I got a bit
carried away on the motorcycle.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.572
Now we'll never make it
to Flemm Rock on time.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.116
It's okay, Rock.
We'll think of something.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.077
Well, I'm done.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.496
(alarm sounding)

19:24.580 --> 19:26.248
Congratulations, sir.

19:26.331 --> 19:26.915
{\an1}You are the first ever
to finish

19:26.999 --> 19:29.877
{\an1}the knockwurst
nightmare platter.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.881
{\an1}You have won Rice-A-Roony,
the San Fernando treat,

19:33.964 --> 19:39.094
{\an1}a copy of our home game,
and of course...

19:39.177 --> 19:41.096
the weeniemobile.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.936
{\an5}(gasps)
Look, Rock!
It's a big weenie!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.438

19:49.521 --> 19:52.941
We are back on the road!

{\an3}Woohoo!

20:01.283 --> 20:04.202

Nothing can stop us now.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.415

Flemm Rock, here we come!

20:08.498 --> 20:10.667
(engine sputtering)

20:14.922 --> 20:15.547
What's wrong, Heff?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.799
I think the battery
is dead.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.469

No, no problem.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.534
What's the matter?

20:44.618 --> 20:48.538
Do I intimidate you?

20:48.622 --> 20:52.042
I apologize.
Certainly not my intent.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.795
I say we tie 'em to the bikes
and drag 'em.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.338
Shut up, stinkweed.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.174
{\an1}It's people like you that
give biker trash a bad name.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.676
Sorry.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.554
{\an1}You see, we bikers have a bit
of an image problem.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.933
{\an1}Unfair portrayal
by the media, mostly.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.018

21:25.742 --> 21:26.535
Spike, tighten the rods.

21:26.618 --> 21:30.163
Stinkweed, make sure
the bun is toasted.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.874
{\an1}Okay, we recharged the battery,
rotated your tires,

21:32.958 --> 21:35.627
{\an1}gapped your plugs and
re-torqued your curtain rods.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.879
Here's your complimentary
roadmap and air freshener.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.048
Have a nice trip.

21:40.132 --> 21:40.882
Thanks for all your help.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.884
{\an1}Oh, no, Rocko!
We've only got ten minutes!

21:42.968 --> 21:45.554
We'll never make it in time.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.304
Oh, yes, we will.

21:52.477 --> 21:56.398
Kinda gives you a warm fuzzy
feeling inside, don't it?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.367
Hit the brakes, Rock!

22:15.167 --> 22:15.542
{\an1}(crash)

22:19.171 --> 22:21.757
(gasps)
We made it, Rock!

22:21.840 --> 22:24.760
That'll be
$5, sir.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.601
(gasps)
There it is!

22:32.684 --> 22:35.771
{\an1}How did that Yukon Sheldon
fellow climb that?

22:35.854 --> 22:38.815
It wasn't easy,
I can tell you.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.903
It's gonna blow, Rocko!
It's gonna blow!

22:45.781 --> 22:49.618
It's more glorious
than I ever imagined.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.577
All right, folks.
Show's over.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.295
Look, Rock!
A Chokey Chicken!

23:00.378 --> 23:02.464
And I'm starved!

23:02.547 --> 23:05.092
{\an1}You know, Heff,
it's good discovering America

23:05.175 --> 23:06.593
{\an1}on the back roads.
We should do more of it.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.929
Great, Rock!

23:09.012 --> 23:12.015
{\an1}'Cause Toe Jam Towers
are only 300 miles from here

23:12.099 --> 23:16.645
{\an1}and there's the biggest
processed cheese, then Purvis,

23:16.728 --> 23:18.980
and more motels
with wiggle beds.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.149
And... and...

23:21.233 --> 23:21.817
Rocko?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.820
You okay, Rock?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.488
Rock?

23:26.571 --> 23:27.489
Rocko?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.990
Rocko!

23:29.074 --> 23:30.075
Rocko!
