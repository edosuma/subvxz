01:59.578 --> 02:00.579
Hello?

02:00.662 --> 02:01.663
Mum?

02:02.164 --> 02:04.249
I've been waiting for you.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.710
I've been waiting a very long time.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.714
But that's all right. You're here now.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.425
You're not Mum. Who are you?

02:13.509 --> 02:14.927
A friend.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.763
A friend who can tell you the truth.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.889
The truth?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.015
About what?

02:20.098 --> 02:23.977
Don't you want to know who you really are?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.493
Floof, what are you doing?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.413
Wolfy?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.207
Where's he going?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.048
Hey, Xandra.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.801
In your shiny face--

02:55.884 --> 02:57.261
Xandra?

02:57.344 --> 03:00.305
Wolfy's gone. I think he's sleepwalking.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.314
I told you.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.941
Well, where is he going?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.361
Well, we should just wake him upand ask him.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.655
Wolfy! Wolfy!

03:17.906 --> 03:19.199
Sorry.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.076
Hooligans.

03:23.912 --> 03:24.955
Now what?

03:38.468 --> 03:39.970
Well, that didn't work.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.348
Nice try though, Floof.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.186
Now, now what?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.898
I don't know.Why don't you come up with a plan?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.609
What if we tickled him?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.029
Why don't you come up with a better plan?

03:57.112 --> 04:00.073
There's no way he'd sleep througha round of…

04:00.157 --> 04:02.743
tickly tendrils.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.912
Where's he gone?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.292
There.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.919
He's going into River Lab.

04:27.851 --> 04:28.894
Oh, no!

04:46.078 --> 04:48.080
Oh, crumbs.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.123
-Come on, Sprout. We can't lose him.-Right!

04:50.207 --> 04:53.627
What? No. Let's not be hasty.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.716
Hey, this is fun!

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
What is this thing?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.011
It's a riverling.

05:03.095 --> 05:06.139
River sprytes use themto shape the rivers and streams.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.392
Will it eat us?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.727
No, Sprout. It eats mud.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.484
Hey, Xandra?

05:17.568 --> 05:19.653
Where does that cave go?

05:28.078 --> 05:31.331
Don't give up now.I'm waiting for you.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.429
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no--

05:45.512 --> 05:46.930
Hold on, Sprout.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.152
Not this place again.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.905
Come on, Sprout.Let's find Wolfboy before that old--

06:02.988 --> 06:05.324
-Well, well, well.-Great.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.326
Look who it is.

06:07.409 --> 06:12.080
Excuse me, Mrs. Crab Lady.Did you see where our friend went?

06:12.164 --> 06:13.665
Yeah, I saw him.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.834
He didn't even stop to say hello,

06:15.918 --> 06:18.587
just swam off down therelike he owned the place.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.423
Sleep-swimming?

06:21.507 --> 06:23.300
This is serious.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.136
The absolute cheek of it.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.221
Thank you!

06:27.304 --> 06:32.601
I come down here for some peace and quiet,and every time I turn around…

06:44.404 --> 06:46.323
Not much further now.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.536
Wolfboy?

06:51.787 --> 06:54.414
I don't know where we are,but this place creeps me out.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.709
It creeps you out?I'm supposed to get creeped out.

06:57.793 --> 07:01.505
Great. Now I'm even more creeped outbecause you're creeped out!

07:03.382 --> 07:05.884
You're getting closer.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.874
Soon all will be revealed.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.542
Wolfy!

08:33.054 --> 08:34.597
Wolfboy!

08:35.765 --> 08:37.100
Professor Luxcraft.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.686
-What is the meaning of this?-He's asleep, sir.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.563
Well, I can see that.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.448
Morning.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.160
Don't you "morning" me, boy.This area's strictly forbidden!

08:55.661 --> 08:57.704
What do you three think you're playing at?

08:57.788 --> 08:59.706
There was a whole to-do, you see.

08:59.790 --> 09:03.168
I woke up and I found outthat Wolfboy was out of bed.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.253
Then--

09:05.629 --> 09:07.381
It was an accident, sir.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.758
We-- We just…

09:09.842 --> 09:10.968
got a bit lost.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.971
A little bit lost?I'd say you got a big bit lost.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.640
And this is no place for getting lost,little or big.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.141
Why? Where are we?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.227
Well, somewhere.

09:20.310 --> 09:25.274
But-- Somewhere unimportant.Forbidden, but unimportant.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.240
Hey, Professor, where does that go to?

09:33.323 --> 09:35.492
Never mind that. You should all be asleep.

09:35.576 --> 09:39.621
You're right, sir.We should be asleep.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.706
And laying low.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.834
Exactly. And laying low.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.670
Do you know how we might get backto our dorm?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.423
So we can sleep. And lay low.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.054
Squint will show you the way.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.223
But you must never come back here.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.933
Do you understand me? It's too…

10:02.144 --> 10:03.478
unimportant.

10:03.562 --> 10:07.107
-But---Come on. Let's go and lay low.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.999
And you think the voice was leading youto that creepy passage?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.336
Where do you think it goes?

10:27.419 --> 10:31.507
I don't know. But Luxcraft obviouslydoesn't want me to find out.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.635
He's hiding something. I just know it.

10:34.718 --> 10:38.889
I think maybe whoever that voicebelongs to can tell me what it is.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.602
I don't think we should be trustingstrange voices in dreams, Wolfy.

10:43.685 --> 10:49.316
Yeah. And if Luxcraft finds you back nearthat passage, he's not going to be happy.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.778
We're already on thin ice.What if he sends you home?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.573
Maybe you're right.But what if I have the same dream again?

10:56.657 --> 10:59.368
Perhaps you need a new dream.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.163
Hey, Oneira. Didn't see you there.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.707
Are you having bad dreams?

11:06.458 --> 11:07.918
Yeah. Kinda.

11:08.001 --> 11:12.047
We should go to the Dream Laband get you a new dream.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.842
Great idea.We'll go first thing in the morning.

11:14.925 --> 11:19.471
And until then,no more sleepwalking on my watch.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.227
So, how long's this gonna take?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.436
Not long.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.147
But it dependswhat kind of dream he wants.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.942
I get to choose? That's awesome.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.361
Hey, we should all get new dreams.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.282
No, thank you. I'm perfectly happywith the dream I have now.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.868
-The leaf dream?-The leaf dream.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.913
-What's the leaf dream?-You'd love it, Wolfy.

11:44.997 --> 11:48.166
Okay, well, it starts off, and I'm a leaf.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.586
I'm just hanging around, being leaf.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.338
But then comes a gust of wind!

11:53.422 --> 11:56.091
And I'm like, "Oh, no! What do I do?"

11:56.175 --> 11:59.261
And I hang on tight,then the gust of wind dies down.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.345
And I'm safe.

12:00.429 --> 12:04.099
Now I'm back to being a leaf,just hanging out. But then--

12:04.183 --> 12:05.726
That sounds pretty cool.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.313
But might be a bit too leafyfor my tastes.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.690
It's a shame Blip didn't wanna come.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.359
Blip doesn't like the Dream Lab.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.987
He says it's too unpredictable.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.740
But I think you'll love it, Wolfy.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.132
-Excuse me.-Coming through.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.217
-Look out!-Goodness.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.260
-Give me a hand here.-Okay, everyone, on three.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.513
One, two...

12:42.596 --> 12:44.431
Could you pass me that? Thank you.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.643
Cool! What are these little things?

12:47.726 --> 12:49.311
Those are the dreams.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.689
The ones here are waiting to be shipped upto the humans.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.234
Just wait till you see them in the wild.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.652
In the wild?

12:59.780 --> 13:00.948
Whoopsies.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.910
Oh, no, no, no!

13:04.993 --> 13:06.203
-Over there!-Oh, no!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.330
-Get it! Help!-It's over here!

13:08.413 --> 13:10.207
-All right, everyone.-Look out!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.543
Tallyho!

13:16.922 --> 13:19.842
Blow me down and call me a turnip twister.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.802
Is that little Oneira?

13:23.220 --> 13:24.972
Welcome home, Oni.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.140
Welcome home?

13:27.224 --> 13:29.810
And what have we here?

13:29.893 --> 13:32.145
A ragtag band of chums?

13:32.229 --> 13:35.732
And with a whiff of adventurebetween their teeth, I'll bet.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.903
Yes. Looks like an expedition in waitingif ever I saw one.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.530
And I've seen a few.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.367
Captain Amelia Springhaart.

13:46.451 --> 13:50.956
My friends call me Millie,and my enemies dare not speak my name.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.416
I like her.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.626
Come on, then. Let's get you inside.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.888
So, what brings you back, Oni?

14:05.971 --> 14:09.016
Well, Wolfy here is having bad dreams.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.560
I thought you might be able to find hima new one.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.479
Bad dreams? That won't do at all.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.232
It's not a bad dream, exactly.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.944
It's just…following it was getting me into trouble.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.489
Don't worry, Wulfo.We'll get you sorted out, all right.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.200
Just leave it to me.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.744
Now, first things first.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.288
If we're going on an adventure,

14:31.371 --> 14:34.249
no lounging around herelike a bunch of lizards.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.169
Let's get this expedition started.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.255
We'll get you a new dream in no time,

14:40.339 --> 14:43.342
or my name's not Millie Springhaart.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.566
Isn't it wonderful, Wolfy?

14:59.650 --> 15:02.110
I haven't been home in ages.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.409
Hey, why does Oneirakeep calling this place home?

15:09.493 --> 15:11.912
You didn't know? Oneira grew up here.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.916
She was practically raised by dreams.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.751
Raised by dreams?

15:17.835 --> 15:20.295
Wulfo, front and center.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.607
These creatures are all dreams?

15:40.691 --> 15:42.609
Wild dreams.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.528
Aren't they beautiful?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.779
They really are.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.950
Now then, Wulfo,any particular sort of dream you're after?

15:50.033 --> 15:52.995
-You seem the adventurous type.-Thanks.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.663
-Scared of heights?-Nope.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.748
Fond of mallards?

15:56.832 --> 15:57.833
I guess.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.961
Do you like the color yellow?

16:01.837 --> 16:03.589
Yes.

16:05.215 --> 16:09.678
Yes. I think we're looking for somethinga little out of the ordinary. Aren't we?

16:09.761 --> 16:11.763
Perhaps you should choose.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.312
-What about this one?-That one?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.356
You are the adventurous type.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.442
And I do love a challenge.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.986
All right, Wulfo. You're on.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.198
This particular dream is foundcloser to the boundary.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.535
But something tells meyou don't mind a bit of danger. Onward!

16:42.044 --> 16:45.756
Hey, what's this boundarySpringhaart's talking about?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.090
Is it dangerous?

16:47.174 --> 16:51.345
Oh, no. Not really.The disarrays tend to stay on their side.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.554
Disarrays?

16:52.638 --> 16:55.682
The Dreamscape sits on the borderof our realm…

16:56.767 --> 16:58.519
and theirs.

16:59.561 --> 17:04.650
The closer we get to the disarray side,the more unstable things become.

17:05.150 --> 17:08.819
It can be a bit confusingfinding your way there.

17:08.904 --> 17:12.532
But it's wherethe most interesting dreams are found.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.077
What happens on the other sideof the boundary?

17:15.160 --> 17:19.248
Dreams that cross the borderbecome nightmares.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.374
Nightmares?

17:20.457 --> 17:24.962
Oh, yes. Disarrays catch nightmares.Just like we catch dreams.

17:30.175 --> 17:34.388
Stick close now.We're getting closer to the boundary.

17:34.471 --> 17:38.892
I don't know why you couldn'thave chosen a nice, tame dream, Wolfy.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.357
Hey. Hey! There's someone--

17:47.985 --> 17:50.153
I've been waiting for you.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.700
Did anyone else hear that?

18:12.593 --> 18:14.553
Steady, Wulfo.

18:14.636 --> 18:18.515
This far out, everything becomesa little more unpredictable,

18:18.599 --> 18:21.476
and not everything is as it seems.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.627
Wait. I see something else.

18:48.337 --> 18:52.424
Disarrays. What are they doingon this side of the boundary?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.053
It looks likethey're stalking a nightmare.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.347
A nightmare?

18:59.097 --> 19:03.393
It'll be okay.Just don't make a sound.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.778
Nightmare!

19:14.947 --> 19:16.198
Look alive, everyone!

19:20.452 --> 19:21.703
Tallyho!

19:28.168 --> 19:29.294
Thanks.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.797
Where's Wolfboy?

19:37.219 --> 19:41.348
Wulfo? Wulfo?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.685
You won't find any answers back there.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.819
Wulfo?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.239
Wulfo?

19:58.574 --> 20:00.909
I have so much to tell you.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.122
Who are you?

20:09.334 --> 20:12.171
If this boy is who I think he is…

20:12.254 --> 20:13.547
Professor Luxcraft?

20:16.550 --> 20:20.554
…I'll make sure he never knowswhat he's truly capable of.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.437
What is it? What won't you show me?

20:30.272 --> 20:32.357
I'll tell you when you're ready.

20:32.441 --> 20:35.694
I deserve to know what's going on!

20:35.777 --> 20:37.613
Not until you're ready!

20:54.546 --> 20:56.840
-Excaliboom?-He thinks he's special.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.926
Excaliboom!

21:00.093 --> 21:02.596
Did you hear? He thinks he's special.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.097
You're nothing. You're nobody.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.182
Poor boy.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.976
You have a lot on your mind.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.647
Don't be afraid, child.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.731
Who are you?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.992
My name is Nyx.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.577
Nyx?

21:25.661 --> 21:28.038
Wait. I know about you.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.541
You killed Xandra's parents.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.211
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.464
They're lying to you, human.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.716
But you already knew that.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.804
-My friends would never---But we're not talking about your friends,

21:43.887 --> 21:44.930
are we?

21:50.352 --> 21:52.354
I know who you are.

21:52.437 --> 21:55.107
I know what you're truly capable of.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.237
You're going to change the world, William.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.406
How do you know my name?

22:04.074 --> 22:06.535
I know more than you might think.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.455
There he is!

22:10.539 --> 22:12.082
Come find me when you're ready.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.166
No, wait!

22:14.293 --> 22:16.753
Are you okay? What happened?

22:16.837 --> 22:17.838
I…

22:22.467 --> 22:23.760
I'm not sure.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.431
Yeah, this place is like that sometimes.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.696
All you need to dois pop this on your head

22:42.779 --> 22:44.531
before you go to sleep.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.243
Then I'll have a brand-new dream?

22:48.744 --> 22:52.581
And I'll forget all aboutthat mysterious passage.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.837
You don't want a new dream, do you?

23:02.674 --> 23:04.009
I understand.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.511
Our dreams are special.

23:05.594 --> 23:09.640
I think my dreams know more about methan anyone else.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.445
Wolfy?

23:29.952 --> 23:30.953
Wolfy.
