00:17.225 --> 00:20.145
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.647
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.859
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.406
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.953
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
-A scary tale.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
-A strange tale.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.709
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.921
-You really think you can handle it?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.219
-Mmm!

00:53.303 --> 00:54.471
-Psst!
-Mm-mmm!

00:54.554 --> 00:55.638
-Dotty!
-Mmm?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.515
-Psst! Dotty!

00:57.599 --> 00:59.434
-What are you doing?
-Check it out!

01:00.769 --> 01:04.230
There is so much free food
around this place.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.482
If you don't be quiet,

01:05.565 --> 01:07.358
-we'll be the free food!
-Ahem.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.613
-Once upon a time--
-Hey, this is all happening now.

01:11.696 --> 01:15.158
-Uh, once upon a right now, over there,

01:15.241 --> 01:16.242
a brother and sister

01:16.326 --> 01:19.204
-are trying to come up with a plan.
-Mmm!

01:20.580 --> 01:22.248
Mmm! Mmm.

01:22.332 --> 01:27.003
Dotty, we must not interfere in any way,
or we will be ravens forever!

01:27.087 --> 01:31.007
Yeah, ravens forever!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.678
-Huh?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.140
This is perfect.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.976
It's like everything that's happened
to us since we left home

01:42.060 --> 01:43.853
was just to prepare us for this plan.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
It all makes sense.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.774
We had to suffer
so the kingdom could be saved.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.276
How's it coming along?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.278
We know how to defeat the dragon.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.698
Oh? Uh, let's see this plan of yours.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.909
To fight a dragon, you need an army.

01:57.992 --> 02:01.371
Luckily, we've made a lot of friends
out there, friends who wanna help.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.291
Also, we have
a lot of experience with monsters.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.918
She means you guys.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.754
-Oh…

02:09.838 --> 02:11.798
Anyway, we've sent out word.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.967
Our friends are on their way.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.018
From up here, we'll see them coming.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.692
Are you sure they'll come?

02:30.775 --> 02:32.235
They'll show up.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.194
You'll see.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.783
Any minute now.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.580
-Any… minute… now.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.752
We want you to know
that even if no one shows up,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.838
we're very proud of you both.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.340
Where are they?

02:54.424 --> 02:55.550
They'll be here.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.552
They will.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.305
We don't want you to be too disappointed.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.015
No one blames you!

03:02.098 --> 03:06.227
Raising an army is more
than anyone could expect you to do.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.647
After all, you're only children!

03:19.157 --> 03:21.451
-They should be here.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.917
Hi, Hansel!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.711
-Oh, hey, little Sparrow brother!

03:31.794 --> 03:33.129
Is that it?

03:34.422 --> 03:37.800
-It was sweet that they tried.
-Hello.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.015
We're here for the war.
Is this the right place?

03:44.098 --> 03:46.726
It looks like
you're the only ones, Mr. Bauer.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.687
We're so sorry
to have made you come all this way!

03:59.906 --> 04:01.324
Hey, birdy brothers!

04:02.367 --> 04:03.660
-Look!

04:03.743 --> 04:07.205
Thank you. Thank you.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.915
-No need to cheer.
-Hansel!

04:08.998 --> 04:13.461
Haven't seen you since the day I sank
my dagger deep into your hairy flesh!

04:13.544 --> 04:14.671
Glad to see you're well.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.006
He did what?!

04:17.090 --> 04:18.466
-What happened?
-Eh.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.969
I turned into a beast.
It was a whole thing.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.889
You're all here!

04:24.973 --> 04:28.017
Katherine! Susanna! Ingrid! Constance!

04:28.101 --> 04:31.521
Theodelinda! Edna! Lilith! Marianne!

04:31.604 --> 04:33.481
-Gretel!
-Widow Fischer!

04:33.564 --> 04:36.901
Boil anyone in oil with snakes recently?

04:36.985 --> 04:39.654
-Never without you, Widow Fischer!

04:39.737 --> 04:40.613
Boil?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.616
It was a warlock
who tried to steal my soul. No biggie.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.748
You're going to fight a dragon
with these people?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.251
-Hey!
-You need a real army!

04:53.334 --> 04:54.544
This is a real army!

04:54.627 --> 04:56.045
These people have heart.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.548
-These are the people of Grimm.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.800
Well, I, uh…

05:00.883 --> 05:03.720
-I stand corrected, I guess.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.021
People of--

05:13.104 --> 05:16.441
People of Grimm,
my brother and I have dealt with monsters.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.401
-She means--
-We get it.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.736
Thanks.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.945
We have suffered,

05:21.029 --> 05:23.656
-and you have all suffered, too.
-Mmm…

05:24.157 --> 05:26.284
And now it is time for you,

05:26.826 --> 05:29.746
-all of you, to find your strength!

05:29.829 --> 05:31.789
-Yeah, hooray!
-For Grimm!

05:31.873 --> 05:35.293
So we ask you all,
who's ready to kill a dragon?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.464
-Whoo!
-All right!

05:47.388 --> 05:48.973
Hey there, little swallow.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.058
Ta-da!

05:50.141 --> 05:52.143
-Mr. Draggy!

06:02.278 --> 06:05.490
Fine work, Shillingworth.
Nicely done, indeed!

06:05.573 --> 06:07.950
Lord Meister, good of you to come.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.745
-Yes… Well, I--

06:10.828 --> 06:15.416
Jehorsephat, you're looking well.
I see you're with Shillingworth now.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.086
-I hope you're very happy together.

06:20.296 --> 06:24.008
May the great turnip spirit guide my aim.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.514
Whoa!

06:31.516 --> 06:33.226
Hoo!

06:42.276 --> 06:43.778
Whoa!

06:44.362 --> 06:46.906
-Oh!
-Oh!

06:48.449 --> 06:50.034
Whoa! Whoa!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.119
Hey!

06:51.661 --> 06:52.995
Oh…

06:55.206 --> 06:59.544
I'm a widow! Not married.
Not anymore because he's dead.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.296
I think something is happening here.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.215
Something beautiful.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.511
And gross.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.649
-Ha ha!

07:25.194 --> 07:26.821
-Yeah!

07:38.499 --> 07:41.627
Once the army is prepared,
we'll lure the dragon into a trap

07:41.711 --> 07:43.004
with the golden apples.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.465
Because dragons can't resist gold.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.801
And when he comes to get it,
we'll be ready for him!

07:48.885 --> 07:53.473
Wait, you mean the army
will be ready for him, right?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.933
And you two will be supervising

07:56.017 --> 07:57.685
from a great distance!

07:57.768 --> 07:59.312
-Right?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.229
No!

08:00.313 --> 08:02.982
-We will be there, leading the army.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.860
Uh, did you think
we'd send them out to fight a battle

08:05.943 --> 08:07.361
we wouldn't fight ourselves?

08:07.445 --> 08:11.073
Yes, that's one of the perks
of being a royal,

08:11.157 --> 08:13.284
getting other people to fight for you.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.412
Well, we don't need anyone
to fight our battles!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.581
-Ready?
-Let's do it!

08:18.664 --> 08:19.707
Adventure!

08:19.790 --> 08:22.543
-For the kingdom of Grimm!

08:32.178 --> 08:34.889
So here we are,
and they're really doing it!

08:34.972 --> 08:38.518
Hansel and Gretel
are leading an army to kill the dragon!

08:38.601 --> 08:41.896
Oh, maybe we could help them.
Like, like, we could be lookouts.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.066
Jacob, if we interfere,
we will never break the curse!

08:45.149 --> 08:46.192
Oh, right.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.611
Am I the only one rooting for the dragon?

08:50.655 --> 08:51.989
Yup, just me.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.576
Well, that stinks.
I made "Go Dragon" tunics for us!

08:56.452 --> 08:58.746
What? He has a nice smile!

09:00.748 --> 09:04.085
Betty,
I told you to wait at the castle!

09:04.168 --> 09:07.129
-Well, at least we have snacks.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.089
Bad idea!

09:08.172 --> 09:11.259
You know how sleepy
too much chocolate cake makes us.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.720
Hey, do you think
that will work on the dragon?

09:14.804 --> 09:18.099
Did I say bad idea? I meant good idea!

09:23.396 --> 09:24.605
Is everybody ready?

09:32.488 --> 09:33.739
This has to work.

09:33.823 --> 09:38.077
If we can stop the dragon, then everything
that's happened to us since we left home,

09:38.703 --> 09:42.707
this whole dark, grim,
crazy mess, meant something.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.877
All right, everyone,
keep watching the skies.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.339
When the dragon lands near the bait,
we'll have him surrounded.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.300
Then we attack him all at once!

09:52.383 --> 09:55.011
We'll get that dragon for sure.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.679
Yeah!

09:57.221 --> 09:59.056
Yes, with cake and apples,

09:59.140 --> 10:02.435
and two children giving us
half a day of semi-focused training!

10:02.518 --> 10:04.520
-How could we lose?

10:06.772 --> 10:11.944
Yes, Hansel and Gretel are great leaders.
Three cheers for Hansel and Gretel.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.530
-Hip, hip… hip?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.325
Shh! We're supposed to be hiding.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.328
-Hooray!
-Shh!

10:21.829 --> 10:24.624
Once upon a time,
I was scared out of my mind!

10:24.707 --> 10:26.083
Can we stick to the story?

10:26.167 --> 10:30.129
A brother and a sister
are about to fight a dragon!

10:30.212 --> 10:32.298
-Are you wearing lipstick?
-No!

10:33.549 --> 10:35.176
-A little.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.732
-The dragon!

10:51.692 --> 10:54.070
-It came on foot?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.864
-Dragons don't do that! They have wings!

10:56.947 --> 10:59.950
Specifically so
they don't have to walk to places!

11:16.926 --> 11:21.222
Turns out he's a jerk! I'm so glad
I found out before we started dating.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.015
-I was right.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.850
-I told you--

11:24.934 --> 11:26.477
Don't look at that! It's horrible.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.025
Hey, William,
it's time for artists' renderings!

11:37.947 --> 11:41.283
And so,
the dragon wreaks havoc upon the army!

11:41.367 --> 11:44.078
They were helpless
against his savage might!

11:44.161 --> 11:46.247
-Oh, that's very good.
-Oh, thank you!

11:46.330 --> 11:47.623
I can only draw cats.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.212
For the kingdom of Grimm!

12:11.355 --> 12:12.481
So proud.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.783
-Ah!

12:24.869 --> 12:28.080
Why don't you pick on someone
your own smell?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.040
-Ha ha! Whee!

12:46.640 --> 12:48.225
Oh, my little Shilly!

12:52.855 --> 12:53.939
I'm a widow!

12:54.023 --> 12:56.609
-And you're remarkable.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.696
Watch this fishy whack you in the head!

13:02.406 --> 13:04.200
Meanwhile…

13:10.581 --> 13:13.959
It's mayhem! Wanton destruction!

13:22.384 --> 13:24.220
-Don't look!

13:24.303 --> 13:25.596
-Can I look?
-Whoa!

13:25.679 --> 13:29.099
-Ooh! That's the good stuff!

13:29.183 --> 13:31.644
Look! Gretel's doing something hero-ey!

13:42.238 --> 13:43.239
I can't look!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.074
Wait, yes, I can.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.660
I'm looking! Look at me looking!

14:14.228 --> 14:15.604
I command thee…

14:16.188 --> 14:18.232
-Fetch!

14:22.111 --> 14:25.155
Good boys, they're good boys.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.462
-Oh, the humanity.

14:42.131 --> 14:46.218
I have seen a lot of nasty stuff
in my life, and that was most of it.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.387
I wanted to go to art school.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.641
But my dad said,
"No, Jacob, get a degree in deckhanding."

14:52.725 --> 14:55.477
"Lots of job security in deckhanding!"

14:55.561 --> 14:58.397
But Daddy didn't know about the Devil!
Did you, Daddy?

15:07.489 --> 15:08.449
Hey!

15:17.958 --> 15:20.085
Try to hit him in the teeth!

15:30.304 --> 15:31.180
Cake.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.440
Mmm.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.067
Totally worth it.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.702
-Hansel, he's eating the cakes!

15:54.244 --> 15:55.245
And that guy.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
It worked! It's making him tired!

16:04.463 --> 16:08.133
So now we impale him
on a peppermint stick?

16:08.217 --> 16:11.178
-No!
-Right, that was that other thing.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.682
Now we lead the army to attack him
while he's at his weakest.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.558
Everyone, get ready to--

16:22.439 --> 16:23.482
Oh…

16:23.565 --> 16:26.193
-I guess it's just us.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.653
Can we do this?

16:27.736 --> 16:30.614
-Only we can do this.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.743
Hey.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.955
I don't suppose
you can become a beast again.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.127
I never really stopped being one.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.233
-Yeah!

17:06.316 --> 17:07.192
Whoo!

17:10.279 --> 17:12.322
Aw, boo hoo!

17:32.468 --> 17:33.635
Ah!

17:35.345 --> 17:36.764
Dragon!

17:36.847 --> 17:38.974
-Come and get me!

17:47.274 --> 17:48.484
My sword!

17:50.694 --> 17:51.904
Gretel, no!

17:54.073 --> 17:57.826
But it's-- it's gonna kill Gretel!
We have to help her!

17:57.910 --> 18:00.245
-We can't! It's forbidden!

18:00.329 --> 18:03.248
-Hey! Hey, you! Forget her!

18:03.957 --> 18:05.250
I have your toe!

18:20.974 --> 18:23.185
-Hmm.
-My Lord, no!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.437
You can't fight the dragon alone!

18:30.150 --> 18:32.820
-I must do what's right!

18:32.903 --> 18:36.073
-It's a rule!

19:02.099 --> 19:04.434
-No!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.695
-Dragon!

19:27.416 --> 19:29.501
-The moon!

19:35.591 --> 19:38.427
You stay away from that nice girl!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.476
Yeah!

19:46.560 --> 19:50.272
-Alley-oop!

19:58.238 --> 19:59.656
-Ha-ha!

19:59.740 --> 20:01.867
Now, you can't get away from-- Gah!

20:01.950 --> 20:03.869
-…me.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.081
-It was worth a try!

20:11.126 --> 20:13.170
-Thank you.

20:13.670 --> 20:17.257
-All I gotta do is lead it to the moon.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.726
You're gonna be lunch!

20:34.316 --> 20:36.276
-It's the moon!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.736
She's going for the moon!

20:37.819 --> 20:39.112
She's not gonna make it!

20:41.031 --> 20:42.741
-Oh, oh, oh…
-To heck with it!

20:47.287 --> 20:48.497
What was that?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.999
You can thank me later, just climb!

20:55.796 --> 20:56.964
But-- What--

20:57.047 --> 20:59.132
What about not interfering?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.592
I couldn't let her die!

21:00.676 --> 21:04.221
Ravens forever! Whoo!

21:07.724 --> 21:09.726
-Come on!

21:17.526 --> 21:18.986
Help!

21:19.069 --> 21:21.571
-I got you! I got-- Ooh!

21:28.328 --> 21:29.538
Gretel!

21:59.735 --> 22:03.238
Come on! Come on!

22:03.322 --> 22:06.491
Come on over here, you little yum-yum.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.453
-Not this little yum-yum.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.789
She can do it!

22:22.257 --> 22:24.343
-Gretel!

22:27.387 --> 22:30.307
-All together!

22:34.478 --> 22:35.937
Keep going!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.733
-Whoa!

22:45.530 --> 22:46.948
Go limp! Go limp! Go limp!

22:50.202 --> 22:52.704
-Oops.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.378
-Oh, right. Gretel!

23:00.879 --> 23:02.214
Gretel, are you okay?

23:27.447 --> 23:29.157
-Gretel!
-Hansel!

23:30.659 --> 23:31.535
You're alive!

23:31.618 --> 23:32.619
So are you!

23:34.121 --> 23:35.747
Is the dragon…

23:36.456 --> 23:37.707
It's gone.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.085
It flew away after the moon bit its face!

23:40.168 --> 23:41.795
-Jacob, hush!
-What?

23:41.878 --> 23:44.047
I mean, we might as well talk to them now.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.425
What's gonna happen?
We'll get more cursed?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.552
Uh, you can always get more cursed.

23:48.635 --> 23:52.431
My uncle pooped on a witch,
and now he's a shriveled mushroom.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.766
Who are you guys?

23:54.850 --> 23:58.186
It's a long story,
longer than we expected, in fact.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.063
They just saved my life.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.232
Twice, I think.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.609
Thank you for saving my sister.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.697
Can I offer you, um, I don't know, corn?

24:08.780 --> 24:12.784
What? The very idea that we would
accept payment for a good deed!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.120
-Outrageous!

24:16.329 --> 24:18.248
Do you have any corn, though?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.750
Actually, no.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.793
Hansel…

24:28.216 --> 24:31.178
Welp, looks like
the buffet is finally open!

24:33.847 --> 24:37.225
Come along, Dotty.
Let's let these kids grieve their loss.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.895
Okay, just this, then!

24:46.818 --> 24:49.029
This looks more like hell than hell did.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.365
Hansel, what have we done?

24:53.074 --> 24:55.118
We… lost.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.579
We swore we'd protect these people.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.289
We convinced them to fight,

24:59.956 --> 25:01.041
and they died.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.297
One, two, three…

25:07.380 --> 25:10.091
They are only six.
Why are there only six?!

25:11.760 --> 25:13.720
Mr. Draggy!

25:13.803 --> 25:15.514
Okay, okay.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.065
Why did we think we could lead an army?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.609
We ruined everything!

25:28.568 --> 25:30.695
I can't believe it ended like this.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.948
This can't be the end.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.741
I mean, it can't be!

25:34.824 --> 25:37.619
It'll get better, right?
Won't it get better?!

25:39.496 --> 25:40.497
I don't know.
