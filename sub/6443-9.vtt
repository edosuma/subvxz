My favorite song.

What's your name?

05:22.516 --> 05:24.868
<i>Mr. Luthor has no comment.</i>

05:25.671 --> 05:27.771
Don't say anything.

05:30.241 --> 05:33.981
Look people I've told you,
my client has no comment, alright?

05:33.983 --> 05:39.568
<i>Billionaire Lex Luthor was released today

05:39.569 --> 05:44.395
<i>only suspect in the grisly slaying this
morning of a young woman whose body has</i>

05:44.400 --> 05:47.575
<i>not yet been identified. The police
investigators...</i>

05:50.202 --> 05:54.602
So, you won't tell me how you wound up lying
naked, covered in blood, next to a dead girl

05:54.609 --> 05:56.504
- you hardly knew?
- I didn't kill her.

05:56.552 --> 06:01.244
I didn't ask. Lex you're paying me to get
you off, not to prove you're innocent.

06:01.259 --> 06:04.965
But you're going to have
to be straight with me...

06:05.802 --> 06:08.358
- Were you drinking last night?
- Yes.

06:08.449 --> 06:11.940
At the fundraiser in the hotel.
We had champagne.

06:12.016 --> 06:15.072
- Is it possible that you were drugged?
- It wouldn't be the first time.

06:15.149 --> 06:18.689
If you were drugged it will show up in
the blood test I had you take.

06:18.698 --> 06:23.398
In the meantime, you're going to have to try
to remember anything you can about this girl.

06:24.870 --> 06:26.577
I can't.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.727
She had a pink MP3 player.

06:33.255 --> 06:37.099
- We listened to it together.
- That wasn't on the evidence list.

06:37.111 --> 06:40.677
Are you sure she had it with her
at the hotel?

06:42.519 --> 06:47.306
- Excuse me, Corinne. It's the D.A.
- Thank you Shannon, I'll be right there.

06:48.009 --> 06:52.061
You stay put.
It's a media circus out there,

06:52.143 --> 06:54.698
and I don't want you saying anything stupid.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.513
Your bedside manner needs work.

06:57.612 --> 07:02.556
I'm not here to hold your hand, Lex.
You want a hug, call your mother.

07:04.868 --> 07:07.789
- Lex.
- Clark.

07:08.683 --> 07:11.804
I take it you saw my
"Walk of Shame" on the news?

07:11.849 --> 07:15.125
- How are you holding up?
- Not so great actually.

07:15.155 --> 07:19.540
- I trust you're here as a friend.
- Just tell me you didn't do this.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.210
I met a girl at the Opera.

07:25.303 --> 07:29.005
I took her to a hotel,
I didn't kill her.

07:29.441 --> 07:31.157
Who was she?

07:31.572 --> 07:34.858
- I don't know.
- You slept with her but didn't know her name?

07:34.919 --> 07:39.913
It's one of those nights that never happens.
You meet someone and get caught in the moment.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.685
I'm guilty of that, but I'm not a murderer!

07:43.881 --> 07:48.096
- It was my father, he's framing me.
- Your father's in prison.

07:48.142 --> 07:51.279
You really think that matters?

07:51.331 --> 07:56.352
Go home, Clark. You don't want to be
involved in this, trust me.

08:24.189 --> 08:27.096
<i>Je vais dormir seulement un peu.</i>

08:27.100 --> 08:32.100
Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux,
you have been found guilty of practicing

08:32.115 --> 08:35.496
the darkest art, Witchcraft.

08:35.523 --> 08:39.773
I hereby condemn you to burn
in the fires of hell.

08:40.066 --> 08:45.066
<i>Tu m'as trahie, Isabelle!
Maintenant tu vas mourir.</i>

09:18.718 --> 09:21.141
Clark, thank you for coming.

09:21.236 --> 09:22.993
It's good to see you.

09:37.772 --> 09:42.009
How's Lex? I've been trying to contact him
since I heard, but he won't speak to me.

09:42.088 --> 09:44.427
He thinks you're trying to frame him.

09:45.631 --> 09:47.022
Are you?

09:48.959 --> 09:52.016
- No Clark.
- Why should I believe you?

09:52.050 --> 09:55.121
There's no reason you should.

09:56.312 --> 10:00.749
Listen to me, I was ill, Clark...

10:00.811 --> 10:05.482
The liver disease I had was
a death sentence...

10:05.976 --> 10:10.507
and something happened, I can't
explain it...

10:10.539 --> 10:15.507
I woke up on the floor, there
was a riot... I

10:17.663 --> 10:21.011
I felt as if...

10:22.074 --> 10:27.078
a different kind of energy had been..
Inside me,

10:27.107 --> 10:34.307
something strong, and...
good.

10:35.922 --> 10:39.485
I was changed.

10:40.019 --> 10:43.784
And my liver had healed!

10:46.889 --> 10:49.513
- What was it?
- I don't know.

10:49.535 --> 10:55.123
All I can say was... It was miraculous!
I could see...

10:56.498 --> 11:03.186
The darkness... the destructive power
that had always been inside me.

11:05.651 --> 11:08.858
I can see it in Lex now.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.705
I have to help him, Clark.

11:14.455 --> 11:19.103
- Do you think he did it?
- No, this was a crime of passion,

11:19.233 --> 11:23.278
or it was an elaborate frame.
The girl, did she have a car?

11:24.314 --> 11:27.842
Lex told the police that he took her
to the hotel in his Ferrari.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.289
Then they'll look for her car at the opera
house. They won't find it there.

11:31.371 --> 11:36.909
Lex has patterns. He would have had the
girl drive her own card to the hotel,

11:37.359 --> 11:41.140
so he could leave in the morning
and not have to take her home.

11:41.159 --> 11:45.788
The patterns. The girl... she had
brown hair, yes?

11:46.631 --> 11:49.653
She reminded him of Lillian.

11:49.718 --> 11:51.507
It's his mother.

11:52.650 --> 11:55.681
You have to help him, Clark.

11:56.530 --> 11:57.948
If I find this car...

11:57.974 --> 12:01.755
Anything you find, bring
it to me, I can help you.

12:02.786 --> 12:05.303
I'll see where it leads.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.728
- But I still don't trust you.
- I know.

12:09.875 --> 12:13.408
But you will be back...
won't you?

12:23.024 --> 12:25.422
Stupid, stupid.

12:25.446 --> 12:30.962
- I swear, one time that thing actually bit me.
- Hi Lana, it does take a certain touch.

12:32.733 --> 12:36.020
Are you feeling alright, you look a little pale.

12:37.252 --> 12:41.644
I just had this really weird dream last
night, I can't seem to shake it.

12:41.696 --> 12:44.824
Oh, I'm sorry, Lana.
You have a visitor.

12:47.885 --> 12:50.651
She's here for me?
Thanks.

12:55.482 --> 12:57.477
Excuse me.

12:58.435 --> 13:00.683
Lana!

13:01.021 --> 13:06.592
It's wonderful to finally meet you.
You are beautiful.

13:06.905 --> 13:09.784
I'm sorry, do I know you?

13:09.815 --> 13:12.152
I'm Jason's mother.

13:13.529 --> 13:17.388
- Did I catch you off-guard?
- No... no.

13:17.869 --> 13:23.866
Yeah actually, you have a little. I just
didn't know he was expecting you.

13:25.025 --> 13:27.100
Well he isn't.

13:28.547 --> 13:31.419
- Could we sit?
- Sure.

13:31.498 --> 13:33.797
Would you like some tea?

13:34.046 --> 13:35.994
No thank you.

13:36.071 --> 13:40.976
I know this sounds impossibly British, but
I can't bring myself to drink tea from a mug.

13:40.991 --> 13:44.261
- Is that terrible?
- No, of course not.

13:45.949 --> 13:51.177
How's Jason? I haven't spoken to him since
he left Paris...

13:51.186 --> 13:55.508
And he won't answer any of my calls.
I'm afraid that...

13:55.567 --> 14:00.249
- I am afraid he thinks that I'm angry with him.
- You're not?

14:00.572 --> 14:03.529
I simply want to see him again.

14:03.724 --> 14:08.506
Mrs. Teague, I...
I've wanted to meet you.

14:08.608 --> 14:13.942
But if Jason isn't ready to be a part of
your life, I don't think I can either.

14:14.731 --> 14:17.720
Not behind his back.

14:18.400 --> 14:23.357
The last thing I want to do is put you in
the middle of this, but...

14:23.888 --> 14:29.537
If you could just tell him that I'm here,
and that I'm staying at the Smallville Inn.

14:29.609 --> 14:32.871
Tell him I want to see him.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.018
Sure.

14:35.093 --> 14:36.632
Thanks.

14:38.211 --> 14:44.153
You know what's interesting? A moment ago, when
I met you, you looked like you recognized me..

14:46.717 --> 14:48.736
How can that be?

14:53.276 --> 14:58.271
Goodbye, Lana. You must come and visit
me in Metropolis.

15:00.757 --> 15:03.207
You are so beautiful.

15:03.766 --> 15:07.395
I see now why he had to be with you.

15:20.424 --> 15:24.901
- Where have you been all afternoon?
- I went to see Lionel at the prison.

15:25.496 --> 15:29.189
Why, are you backlogged with your Community
Service hours or something?

15:29.194 --> 15:32.290
No, look, I know this sounds crazy,

15:32.366 --> 15:36.810
But Lionel gave me a lead in Lex's case,
he said I'd find the girl's car in the hotel

15:36.833 --> 15:40.302
and I think I did...
Check this out,

15:41.083 --> 15:46.846
There were 22 cars checked into the hotel
valet that night after 10pm when Lex said he

15:46.924 --> 15:51.755
left the opera. Of those cars, all but 3 were
hotel guests, and of those 3, two belong to

15:51.791 --> 15:54.750
- guys that were in the hotel bar.
- Leaving one.

15:54.827 --> 15:57.451
Exactly, but I haven't been able to trace
a name or address.

15:57.509 --> 16:00.588
Why am I not surprised?
Let me try.

16:02.715 --> 16:06.312
You know what the weird thing is?
The police aren't even looking into this.

16:06.346 --> 16:11.079
Of course not, Clark. They think that Lex
is guilty, and they've already got their man.

16:11.469 --> 16:16.329
But don't you think it's possible that this
is a setup? I mean, Lionel Luthor goes all

16:16.341 --> 16:21.343
"Hannibal Lecter" and tells you what to
look for, and where to find it.

16:21.672 --> 16:26.702
I don't think so. I can't explain this, but
something happened to Lionel in prison,

16:26.751 --> 16:29.459
- I think it changed him.
- Clark...

16:29.541 --> 16:34.155
- And what if he really can help?
- Clark, he's the master manipulator, you can't

16:34.165 --> 16:38.881
trust him, Ok? Besides, Lex is in great hands.
He's got Corinne Harper leading his defense.

16:38.902 --> 16:43.806
They call her "The Barracuda".
What he really needs is a good publicist.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.130
Have you see this?

16:46.180 --> 16:51.097
The police have interviewed over 13 women
that have slept with Lex in the past year.

16:53.524 --> 16:55.347
What's wrong?

16:56.814 --> 17:00.981
Lex told me this one-night-stand was
something that never happens.

17:01.053 --> 17:04.978
- And you believed him?
- I've got to believe somebody, Chloe.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.013
There it is.

17:12.832 --> 17:17.679
Eve Andrews, Age 28.
Lives in Metropolis.

17:45.818 --> 17:46.952
Lex.

17:47.674 --> 17:50.706
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving my ass, Clark.

17:50.784 --> 17:53.613
What the hell are you doing here?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.842
You've got to help me... Please.

18:07.198 --> 18:11.126
You were burning evidence, Lex.
Not exactly the actions of an innocent man!

18:11.211 --> 18:13.555
Come on, Clark, think about it!

18:13.619 --> 18:17.219
If I killed that girl, Why would I take a nap
next to her body so the maid can find me?

18:17.225 --> 18:19.015
It doesn't make any sense.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.487
Neither does breaking into her
house, but you did that.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.696
You better be honest with me, cause
right now, I'm an accomplice.

18:24.706 --> 18:26.994
I didn't ask you to show up.

18:27.217 --> 18:29.352
How did you even know to go there?

18:30.761 --> 18:33.510
- I tracked down her car.
- Did you call the cops, too?

18:33.556 --> 18:36.753
- No.
- Cause this is going to be on the 6:00 news now!

18:37.834 --> 18:41.257
- Why'd you go there, Lex?
- I got a call from Corinne's office, saying

18:41.353 --> 18:46.326
they had a lead on an address. I thought
maybe I could find out who she was.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.885
I had no idea what I was walking into.

18:48.946 --> 18:52.269
- What did you find out?
- Her name's Eve Andrews.

18:52.625 --> 18:56.659
And as you can tell from the stack of photos,
she's been stalking me for some time.

18:56.743 --> 18:59.963
- So you did know her?
- No, only by name, but she didn't tell me

18:59.999 --> 19:03.005
at the fundraiser,
so how was I supposed to know?

19:03.171 --> 19:06.114
Clark, you know I didn't do this!

19:06.507 --> 19:09.084
It's my father trying to get back at me.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.084
He knows about all these stalkers! Luthorcorp's
lawyers compiled a database about them

19:13.144 --> 19:17.696
last year. My father knew Eve would be the
perfect victim to make it look like I had motive.

19:17.752 --> 19:20.562
I don't think it's your father, Lex.

19:21.818 --> 19:24.754
I went to see him.
He wants to help.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.310
He was the one who sent you looking
for her car, wasn't he?

19:34.469 --> 19:36.616
- Yes.
- You're playing right into his hands.

19:36.692 --> 19:40.038
- Lex.
- You can't straddle the fence on this one Clark,

19:40.060 --> 19:44.398
My father and I are enemies!
You have to decide who you really trust!

19:48.487 --> 19:51.213
She was stalking him and he didn't know
what she looked like?

19:51.238 --> 19:53.590
He said he'd never seen her before.

19:53.678 --> 19:57.259
Lex lied about a lot of things,
he lied about all those women.

19:57.765 --> 19:59.901
Do you think he could have done it?

19:59.931 --> 20:03.535
I have to say the whole "Firestarter" thing
doesn't scream "innocence", but...

20:04.176 --> 20:07.895
there's something really strange about this.
Look at this.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.945
Wait, I thought Lex's attorneys had all this
under lock and key.

20:14.029 --> 20:18.066
Well, she may know people at the top, but I
know people at the bottom, and they work for tips.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.829
Check this out.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.417
See?

20:22.557 --> 20:25.456
- She's wearing 2 diamond earrings. See that?
- Yeah.

20:25.528 --> 20:29.936
Ok now we're going to skip all this gross
"Zalman King" stuff...

20:29.994 --> 20:35.243
Just before they get out of the elevator and
onto the penthouse floor... and look.

20:40.349 --> 20:44.199
- She lost an earring.
- Exactly. The police report said the dead

20:44.258 --> 20:48.040
woman was wearing 2 diamond earrings. So
either she found it, or...

20:48.112 --> 20:50.945
Lex was with 2 different women.

20:55.066 --> 20:56.959
Thank you, Shannon.

21:04.732 --> 21:07.186
That was my assistant.

21:07.446 --> 21:10.335
Your tox screen came back negative, Lex.

21:10.363 --> 21:14.664
- There were no drugs in your system.
- So it left my system, or the test was altered.

21:14.988 --> 21:17.738
That's certainly not beyond
my father's capabilities.

21:17.810 --> 21:22.283
They've got you lying next to the body, covered
in blood, and now that they ID'ed the victim

21:22.323 --> 21:24.935
- they also have motive.
- Why, because she was stalking me?

21:24.991 --> 21:29.615
Yes. Do you even know why she was
stalking you, Lex?

21:30.566 --> 21:33.708
Because you slept with her 18 months ago.

21:33.734 --> 21:38.448
And then you sent her a pair of diamond
earrings as a consolation prize.

21:38.523 --> 21:41.183
How could you not remember her?

21:42.324 --> 21:46.034
I don't always get their names,
or remember their faces.

21:46.119 --> 21:49.959
I suppose it doesn't help that we
all look alike, does it?

21:50.041 --> 21:54.504
I was your type too, Lex.
Or don't you remember that, either?

21:55.334 --> 21:59.923
- I remember, Corinne.
- Ooh. Goody for me.

22:00.015 --> 22:04.725
You must enjoying this on some level.
Seeing me pay for my indiscretions.

22:04.746 --> 22:07.934
I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a certain
amount of satisfaction

22:08.002 --> 22:11.085
seeing you hoisted on your own petard.

22:11.095 --> 22:15.232
On the plus side, the view from up here
is exceedingly clear.

22:15.994 --> 22:21.108
See I've been thinking that whoever did this
would need to have access to my legal files

22:21.157 --> 22:23.583
to know Eve was stalking me.

22:24.539 --> 22:27.843
I thought it was my dad,
but maybe I was wrong.

22:30.237 --> 22:32.802
That database was your project, wasn't it?

22:32.894 --> 22:37.036
You know what, I knew there might be a
conflict of interest when I took this case.

22:37.304 --> 22:40.179
But I had hoped we got past all that.

22:41.706 --> 22:44.035
Apparently I was wrong.

22:47.519 --> 22:50.489
I'm removing myself as your attorney.

22:58.548 --> 23:02.002
So, the police still haven't picked up on the
"missing earring" thing, and according to

23:02.020 --> 23:06.184
the people at the front desk, they haven't
found anything yet. So that's where we're at.

23:10.237 --> 23:12.422
Well, if I were an earring...

23:14.028 --> 23:19.229
Let's re-enact the event, Ok? So Lex
had Eve up against this wall here, so...

23:21.069 --> 23:24.868
Ok, come on big boy, it's for the cause
of truth and justice, now push me up against

23:24.890 --> 23:29.036
the wall. And her hand was like this,

23:29.088 --> 23:34.018
and I think his hand was like this...

23:36.588 --> 23:39.570
Maybe he knocked the earring
off accidentally.

23:40.183 --> 23:45.611
Yeah. Yeah, and then she pushed him up
against this wall over here like this.

23:47.885 --> 23:48.804
Hi.

23:54.062 --> 23:55.580
Oh my.

23:55.738 --> 23:59.876
- It's Ok You can come in.
- No that's fine, we'll just take the stairs.

24:00.483 --> 24:04.336
No, but nothing was happening!
We weren't doing anything! Really!

24:09.024 --> 24:10.458
Hey Clark.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.772
What if the earring fell down this crack?

24:32.558 --> 24:35.349
I'm glad you came back, Clark.

24:35.351 --> 24:37.498
Why did you bring me this?

24:38.358 --> 24:40.954
I didn't think Lex would tell me the truth.

24:41.763 --> 24:43.705
And you believe that I will?

24:43.941 --> 24:47.116
You wanted to help.
I'm trusting you.

24:48.063 --> 24:50.997
That belonged to the girl that Lex
met at the Opera.

24:51.069 --> 24:53.107
Eve Andrews, yes?

24:54.986 --> 24:59.707
Well that's the thing. Eve Andrews was
wearing 2 earrings when she died.

24:59.743 --> 25:03.953
I think there's 2 girls. And I think the girl
in the elevator is still alive.

25:03.954 --> 25:06.276
I just don't know how to find her.

25:10.867 --> 25:13.625
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."

25:14.702 --> 25:19.016
When I was younger, and I wanted to
get rid of a woman, I would...

25:19.295 --> 25:21.846
send her a pair of diamond earrings.

25:21.865 --> 25:25.351
Delivered by courier,
no messy farewells.

25:25.415 --> 25:27.713
It was my signature.

25:28.079 --> 25:32.077
My son, it seems, is carrying
on the tradition.

25:32.195 --> 25:36.123
The girl in the elevator is a former
lover of Lex's.

25:37.568 --> 25:39.652
She's the killer.

25:41.156 --> 25:47.206
Factor his position on the case
of the Merrins...

26:03.730 --> 26:08.255
Ok, Corinne, I'm here. What's this
new evidence you wanted to talk about?

26:08.358 --> 26:11.181
First you quit, now you're back...

26:11.228 --> 26:13.628
Look, I came a long way,
what do you want?

26:29.472 --> 26:32.401
- 911 emergency.
- Yeah, someone's been killed.

26:32.422 --> 26:36.342
I'm sorry all lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold for the first emergency operator.

26:55.042 --> 26:57.878
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong Lex?

27:02.987 --> 27:05.576
Don't you recognize me?

27:25.342 --> 27:27.029
Promise to be quiet?

27:34.368 --> 27:37.448
- Welcome home.
- How'd you get past my security?

27:37.536 --> 27:42.302
I work for your law firm, Lex. I told them
you'd been drinking in Metropolis,

27:42.407 --> 27:47.473
and you needed a ride home...
They helped me carry you up here.

27:48.385 --> 27:51.376
Why here. Why are you doing this?

27:51.380 --> 27:54.404
Because this is where it all happened.

27:54.891 --> 27:57.973
This is where I earned my earrings...

27:58.482 --> 28:00.438
The first time.

28:00.569 --> 28:05.517
You see, you remember the other night, but
you don't remember the first time.

28:06.563 --> 28:07.612
I do.

28:07.682 --> 28:11.021
I had a fiancée.
But you didn't know that.

28:11.411 --> 28:15.205
I cheated on him with you because
I thought that you loved me.

28:17.037 --> 28:20.509
And when I broke it off with him,
I called to tell you that.

28:20.553 --> 28:22.677
But you wouldn't take my call.

28:22.721 --> 28:26.212
I'm sorry.
If I had known...

28:26.308 --> 28:32.450
But you didn't. And then 3 months later,
I bump into you outside of Corinne's office,

28:32.503 --> 28:36.736
and you don't even recognize me.
It was like I never happened to you.

28:36.829 --> 28:40.699
And so I started going through your files.

28:42.103 --> 28:45.041
Turns out I wasn't the only one.

28:45.402 --> 28:47.587
Eve Andrews.

28:48.806 --> 28:50.818
Among others.

28:51.414 --> 28:54.464
But she was such a fan.

28:55.778 --> 28:58.996
I told her that you wanted to make amends.

28:59.153 --> 29:05.176
And she agreed to come to the hotel, and then
I slipped something into your champagne

29:05.184 --> 29:10.676
after we made love. It's funny your
blood tests didn't pick that up.

29:10.938 --> 29:14.396
- You rigged the tests.
- I just switched out the results.

29:14.455 --> 29:17.477
You were the one that sent me to her place.
You called the police.

29:17.512 --> 29:24.396
You were supposed to get caught. But you
didn't... and so here we are.

29:31.148 --> 29:35.165
Hey. What's wrong?
You haven't said anything all night.

29:37.541 --> 29:39.528
Talk to me.

29:41.293 --> 29:43.329
I met your mom.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.050
Where?

29:46.932 --> 29:50.000
Here. She...

29:50.180 --> 29:54.419
she said that you weren't returning her
calls, so she came to see me.

29:55.208 --> 29:58.582
She's staying at the Smallville Inn,
wants you to stop by.

29:59.895 --> 30:02.018
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

30:02.072 --> 30:04.175
I don't know.

30:05.617 --> 30:07.467
I guess...

30:07.564 --> 30:12.353
Maybe I don't want to be the one
passing notes between you and your mother.

30:15.832 --> 30:18.609
I wouldn't have asked you to do that.

30:19.719 --> 30:22.261
She had no right to come here.

30:25.935 --> 30:27.654
I'm sorry.

30:30.377 --> 30:32.495
She seemed really worried about you.

30:32.528 --> 30:35.903
I bet she did.
I bet she seemed sad, and...

30:36.053 --> 30:38.032
heartbroken...

30:38.883 --> 30:41.120
But, she's not.

30:41.337 --> 30:46.681
She's manipulative... and all my life she's
tried to control me.

30:50.378 --> 30:52.774
What, is there something else?

30:53.256 --> 30:55.407
I dreamed about her.

30:56.022 --> 30:59.362
I mean, I was dreaming about
Isabelle Thoreaux.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.745
She was being burned at the stake.

31:04.113 --> 31:07.162
And suddenly, your mom was there.

31:08.539 --> 31:12.038
It's probably not unusual to dream about
somebody you just met.

31:12.111 --> 31:13.740
Jason.

31:15.161 --> 31:18.709
I dreamt about her
before I met her...

31:25.940 --> 31:27.651
There it is...

31:27.704 --> 31:31.447
- Just like he said.
- How do they get the serial numbers so small?

31:31.765 --> 31:33.353
It's lilliputian.

31:33.422 --> 31:36.426
Lasers. Lionel said all the high-end
diamond dealers do it.

31:36.529 --> 31:39.332
In case it ever gets lost or stolen, you
can track it down.

31:39.350 --> 31:41.880
Or it can track you down.

31:41.914 --> 31:46.266
Oh, I still can't believe that Lionel actually
called his old jewelry guy, and

31:46.326 --> 31:49.355
had him send over the purchase orders.

31:49.687 --> 31:56.311
- Alright, give me the numbers.
- 722DJS3970.

31:57.565 --> 32:02.256
Here we go, 2 diamond earrings.
Wow, very expensive.

32:02.290 --> 32:05.603
Couriered to Ms. Shannon Bell.

32:05.660 --> 32:10.706
- Shannon Bell, how do I know that name.
- According to this, she works in Lex's law firm.

32:11.373 --> 32:14.815
- We have to warn him.
- I'll call the police.

32:21.317 --> 32:24.447
You know you could have
stopped all this, Lex.

32:25.480 --> 32:29.240
All you had to do was recognize me outside
of the Opera.

32:29.933 --> 32:34.110
Just say, "Hi Shannon, it's nice to see you."

32:35.073 --> 32:36.903
But you didn't.

32:36.979 --> 32:40.916
I was wearing the earrings that you bought me.

32:41.043 --> 32:45.256
We had sex again and you still
didn't recognize me!

32:46.735 --> 32:49.271
I had a life, Lex.

32:49.598 --> 32:52.346
I had a fiancée.

32:54.875 --> 32:59.865
You ruined my life, and...
you didn't even know who I was!

33:03.230 --> 33:06.501
And you do this...
all the time.

33:09.634 --> 33:11.638
Please don't do this!

33:16.731 --> 33:18.964
It has to stop.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.755
LUTHOR ACQUITTED OF DOUBLE HOMICIDE

34:13.849 --> 34:18.318
I'm glad Lex was found innocent, but I wish
you would've come to us before you got involved.

34:18.504 --> 34:22.597
First, Dad, I just wanted to help, then I
had to figure out if I could trust him or not.

34:22.931 --> 34:24.900
What did you decide?

34:26.034 --> 34:27.735
I haven't.

34:27.737 --> 34:30.469
I mean, the way he treated those women.

34:31.856 --> 34:34.906
It showed me a side of Lex
I hadn't seen before.

34:34.958 --> 34:38.014
I mean, how could you just not care
that you hurt someone?

34:38.958 --> 34:42.567
Lex was just following
what he's learned son, that's all.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.998
There's something else you should know.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.143
I went to see Lionel.

34:53.328 --> 34:56.167
- What?
- He wanted to help Lex, and he did.

34:56.201 --> 34:58.724
I couldn't have done it without him.

34:59.096 --> 35:02.871
Clark... you know how dangerous that
man is to you.

35:02.958 --> 35:07.398
Dad, that's the thing. I think he's
changed... and his liver healed.

35:07.529 --> 35:10.066
I thought his condition was terminal.

35:11.193 --> 35:14.253
I think something in me actually... healed him.

35:17.767 --> 35:22.552
- Clark, does Lionel know about this?
- No, he actually thinks... it's a miracle.

35:24.049 --> 35:25.734
It is.

35:26.453 --> 35:29.825
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but I really think he has changed.

35:29.912 --> 35:31.390
I could see it in his eyes.

35:31.445 --> 35:36.945
Clark, as far as I'm concerned, Lionel Luthor
is never going to change, and neither is Lex.

35:37.455 --> 35:40.455
And we're just going to have
to accept that.

35:52.648 --> 35:56.006
I understand you helped vindicate me, Dad.

35:56.187 --> 35:59.593
There's just no telling the influence you
seem to have from behind these bars.

35:59.790 --> 36:03.196
I pointed your friend Clark in the right
direction, that's all I did.

36:04.132 --> 36:06.828
You still believe I had something to do
with this, don't you?

36:06.883 --> 36:08.428
No.

36:08.651 --> 36:11.201
I just assume you must
want something in return.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.844
Yes.

36:14.534 --> 36:15.565
Yes I do.

36:15.588 --> 36:17.966
I'm not helping you get released.

36:18.066 --> 36:22.514
You don't understand. I know that
I deserve to be here...

36:22.520 --> 36:25.197
in this terrible place.

36:25.462 --> 36:28.632
I have no one to blame but myself.

36:34.383 --> 36:36.915
I'm in a generous mood, Dad.
So...

36:37.314 --> 36:39.461
let's say I believe that.

36:44.357 --> 36:46.536
What do you want from me?

36:48.006 --> 36:51.222
I want to be your father...
Lex.

36:52.398 --> 36:54.006
If you'll let me.

36:59.105 --> 37:01.506
You've got your health, Dad.

37:02.893 --> 37:05.930
Don't expect another miracle.

37:58.486 --> 38:00.892
I wanted to say thank you.

38:01.009 --> 38:02.787
And I'm sorry.

38:03.595 --> 38:06.314
I know you were only trying to help me.

38:07.094 --> 38:09.720
How long is this going to continue, Lex?

38:09.798 --> 38:11.360
I don't know.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.868
What do you want me to tell you?

38:16.750 --> 38:19.286
I don't want you to tell me anything.

38:19.814 --> 38:21.862
I want you to change.

38:21.886 --> 38:24.495
I don't know if I can.

38:26.555 --> 38:30.302
You know, it seems the only person that
you care about is yourself.

38:31.744 --> 38:35.384
There's a whole side of you that
I don't know about, Lex.

38:36.479 --> 38:38.509
What else don't I know about you?

38:40.238 --> 38:44.214
You don't know that everyday I wonder
why I keep going...

38:45.806 --> 38:48.780
why I do the things I do.

38:52.472 --> 38:55.350
You know Shannon might have been crazy...

38:56.015 --> 38:58.794
but she was right about me.

38:59.746 --> 39:02.776
I treated those women terribly, Clark.

39:03.501 --> 39:06.651
People died, and I could have stopped it.

39:07.629 --> 39:10.003
I see that now.

39:10.105 --> 39:11.856
That's a start.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.983
You know there was a moment the other night,
when that fire she set was coming toward me...

39:18.028 --> 39:20.756
I thought, "Good..."

39:22.463 --> 39:25.441
"save the world a lot of grief."

39:25.496 --> 39:28.326
But somehow the fire went out.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.945
And she was lying on the floor...

39:35.063 --> 39:37.970
and suddenly I had a second chance.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.685
The last few days, Lex...

39:43.516 --> 39:46.823
I thought your father was being more
honest with me that you were...

39:47.935 --> 39:50.208
And I hated that feeling.

39:51.362 --> 39:54.181
I felt like we were enemies.

39:54.970 --> 39:58.026
Don't give up on me yet.

40:15.402 --> 40:17.582
What are you doing here, mother?

40:18.969 --> 40:21.823
I know you don't want to
talk to me, Jason.

40:22.129 --> 40:25.023
But every mother has a right
to see her only son.

40:25.108 --> 40:27.172
You didn't come here to see me.

40:27.247 --> 40:30.184
Is it so terrible to want to meet
your girlfriend?

40:30.218 --> 40:33.720
It's the way you go about it. I'm not going
to let you do it this time.

40:33.726 --> 40:36.162
'Cause it's different.

40:38.498 --> 40:41.322
I will come see you when I'm ready.

40:42.041 --> 40:43.443
When will that be?

40:43.534 --> 40:46.560
I don't know.
But you can't come back here.

40:47.623 --> 40:50.037
I just want you to know, Jason...

40:50.255 --> 40:53.775
that I'm really glad that you're happy,
and Lana is...

40:53.867 --> 40:56.227
an enchanting girl.

40:57.367 --> 41:01.750
I can see why you moved to the middle of
nowhere to be with her, I mean she's...

41:02.148 --> 41:03.939
she's special.

41:05.411 --> 41:08.530
I knew you'd meet someone like her one day.

41:15.077 --> 41:18.276
Did I meet her by accident, or not?

41:20.002 --> 41:24.781
What on Earth are you implying, of course you
did, Jason! How else could you meet her?

41:29.999 --> 41:32.956
I'll wait to hear from you.

41:33.305 --> 41:39.797
