WEBVTT

00:02.328 --> 00:03.659
All right, people,

00:03.695 --> 00:04.822
if there's no new business,

00:04.864 --> 00:07.196
l'd like to call
for a motion to adjourn.

00:07.233 --> 00:08.666
Mr. President, l have a motion,

00:08.701 --> 00:11.568
but as usual, it's not
the one you're calling for.

00:11.604 --> 00:13.868
l can always count on you, Alex.

00:13.906 --> 00:15.965
Well, seeing that
this is the last time

00:16.008 --> 00:17.635
you'll be chairing the
student senate this semester,

00:17.677 --> 00:20.145
Janice and l wanted
to do something

00:20.179 --> 00:22.807
to commemorate
''The Brandon Years.''

00:22.849 --> 00:24.043
''The Brandon Years''?

00:24.083 --> 00:25.243
You ready, Janice?

00:25.284 --> 00:27.514
Before l start reading
our proclamation,

00:27.553 --> 00:29.384
would someone tell them
to bring in the cake?

00:33.192 --> 00:36.423
''Whereas Brandon Walsh
was never officially elected

00:36.462 --> 00:39.989
''President
of California University,

00:40.032 --> 00:41.897
''and survived
a constitutional challenge

00:41.934 --> 00:43.299
''to his presidency to become

00:43.336 --> 00:45.429
an effective leader
and dedicated advocate

00:45.471 --> 00:47.564
''for student rights,

00:47.607 --> 00:50.770
''we, the elected representatives
of the Student Senate,

00:50.810 --> 00:53.745
''by unanimous consent,
would like to thank him

00:53.779 --> 00:55.371
''for a job well done, as well as

00:55.414 --> 00:57.644
''urge him to run
for another term

00:57.683 --> 01:00.277
as President
of California University.''

01:00.319 --> 01:01.786
Hear! Hear!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.098 --> 01:14.828
Wow, uh, thank you.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.893
This is, uh, totally unexpected

01:17.937 --> 01:20.303
and totally bogus.

01:20.339 --> 01:22.637
Thank you all for being here.

01:22.675 --> 01:24.404
lt's been. uh...

01:24.477 --> 01:26.104
lt's been an incredible year.

01:26.145 --> 01:27.669
lt started out kind of rocky,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.908
but somehow we managed to
get through it, didn't we?

01:29.949 --> 01:31.746
He's got a lot of poise.
Very impressive.

01:31.784 --> 01:33.251
And after this meeting,

01:33.286 --> 01:34.685
l'm afraid
l'm going to have to head

01:34.720 --> 01:36.984
right over to the
University Hospital

01:37.023 --> 01:39.014
to get my head examined,
because who else but someone

01:39.058 --> 01:41.686
with extreme
masochistic tendencies

01:41.727 --> 01:45.128
would announce that he's willing
to give this another shot

01:45.164 --> 01:46.358
if you guys are.

01:46.399 --> 01:48.060
Way to go, Bran!

01:54.974 --> 01:58.273
So, l don't really know
what else to say except,

01:58.311 --> 02:00.279
let 'em eat cake.

02:00.313 --> 02:01.905
Kelly, would you do the honors?

02:01.948 --> 02:04.473
Don't mind me, l'm just the
little woman behind the man.

02:04.517 --> 02:08.384
Like Lorena. Go.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.151
How tight do you think
those two really are?

02:11.190 --> 02:13.317
Valerie!

02:13.359 --> 02:14.553
l was just wondering.

02:14.594 --> 02:17.688
That's all.

03:29.135 --> 03:31.763
So, whatever you need,
whatever we can do for you...

03:31.804 --> 03:33.965
Thanks, David, but l'm
actually planning on running

03:34.006 --> 03:35.735
a pretty low-key campaign
this time around.

03:35.775 --> 03:38.403
That's probably 'cause you're
practically running unopposed.

03:38.477 --> 03:41.344
Of course, that was
factored into the equation.

03:42.448 --> 03:45.679
You know , l love it
when you talk political science.

03:45.718 --> 03:47.913
Better go get Kelly over here.

03:47.953 --> 03:48.942
Mm.

03:52.525 --> 03:54.686
l almost faxed Hibler a memo,

03:54.727 --> 03:57.218
asking if l should be worried
about my career or not.

03:57.263 --> 03:59.424
lt was only one meeting.

03:59.532 --> 04:02.660
Yeah. One meeting the Partners
Council had without me.

04:02.702 --> 04:06.160
lf that's not a sign,
l don't know what is.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.934
-l have no idea.
-Yeah.

04:07.973 --> 04:09.497
-Hey, how you doing,
Mr. President? -Presidente.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.839
Hey, guys.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.810
You know, l think l'm speaking
for practically everyone

04:12.845 --> 04:15.370
when l say that we're very glad

04:15.481 --> 04:17.312
that you blew off
your clerkship in Boise.

04:17.349 --> 04:19.613
-Well, thank you.
-You get no arguments from me.

04:19.652 --> 04:21.017
So, what are you going to do?

04:21.053 --> 04:22.213
Well, right now we're just
keeping our options open.

04:22.254 --> 04:23.846
l'm fielding a few offers
from back east,

04:23.889 --> 04:25.857
but we'll probably end up
here in town.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.324
You know, l talked
to an old friend

04:27.359 --> 04:28.883
of yours today on the lnternet.

04:28.928 --> 04:30.725
-Really? Who?
-Jordan Bonner.

04:30.763 --> 04:32.390
No way, you're kidding!

04:32.431 --> 04:34.956
ls this an old flame, or...?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.729
More like a flicker.

04:36.769 --> 04:37.997
So, he tells me today,

04:38.037 --> 04:39.937
that he is now the editor
of the ''Yale Daily News.''

04:39.972 --> 04:41.599
Ah, a fellow homeboy.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.938
You know, l always forget
that you were a Yalie.

04:43.976 --> 04:45.136
Yep. Did four years in
New Haven.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.405
Lived to tell about it, too.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.309
Anyway, Jordan says that
he's still kicking himself

04:48.347 --> 04:50.508
for being too sick
to take you to the prom,

04:50.549 --> 04:53.177
but he's never forgiven you for
not going to school back there.

04:53.219 --> 04:55.084
Well, next time you talk to him,

04:55.121 --> 04:57.351
you tell him to get over it,
because l have.

04:57.389 --> 04:58.413
l will.

04:58.491 --> 05:00.425
Talk to you later, guys.

05:00.459 --> 05:01.824
Brandon.

05:01.861 --> 05:04.352
Getting a little overt,
aren't we, Valerie?

05:04.430 --> 05:05.829
Boy, Val,
you're losing your touch.

05:05.865 --> 05:07.696
At least with Ray and Donna,
you snuck around,

05:07.733 --> 05:09.030
you were a little more subtle.

05:09.068 --> 05:11.036
ls that what you told her l did?

05:11.070 --> 05:13.004
No, l just told her
to watch her back.

05:13.038 --> 05:15.233
Always a pleasure, guys.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.502
-Absolutely.
-Hmm.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.772
You can't have a campaign
without a campaign manager.

05:20.813 --> 05:21.871
Or a First Lady.

05:21.914 --> 05:23.711
Just say the word,
we'll cancel the trip.

05:23.749 --> 05:25.376
Guys, go to New York,
have a great time,

05:25.451 --> 05:27.180
meet all the people
in the fashion business

05:27.219 --> 05:28.379
you need to meet.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.217
Just be back in time
for the victory party.

05:30.256 --> 05:32.850
-You're the best.
-You're the best.

05:33.993 --> 05:35.927
Don't let any of those guys
hit on her.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.189
You got it.

05:37.229 --> 05:40.960
So, what time is
your flight tonight?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.092
We're taking the red-eye.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.761
Well, don't worry.

05:43.803 --> 05:46.067
l'll take good care of your guy
while you're gone.

05:46.105 --> 05:47.595
ls that your way of telling me

05:47.640 --> 05:49.335
you're going to make
a move on Brandon?

05:49.375 --> 05:52.310
l'm talking about Dylan.

05:52.344 --> 05:55.871
He's the one you dream about,
isn't he?

06:57.877 --> 07:00.937
Well, if it isn't my
favorite screenwriter.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.947
Valerie!

07:01.981 --> 07:03.141
What's happening, girl?

07:03.182 --> 07:05.309
Nothing,
just a picnic in the park.

07:05.351 --> 07:07.216
-Oh, sounds delicious. Let's go.
-Oh! Sorry, Charley Tuna.

07:07.253 --> 07:08.982
Where's Dylan?

07:09.021 --> 07:10.181
Uh, Dylan, Dylan?

07:10.222 --> 07:11.917
No, that name doesn't
ring a bell with me.

07:11.957 --> 07:13.185
Come on,
what's going on in there?

07:13.225 --> 07:15.352
Look, he's really just
kind of getting into

07:15.394 --> 07:16.622
something right now.

07:16.662 --> 07:18.220
He's with that hypnotist,
isn't he?

07:18.264 --> 07:20.755
What do you say we check on
him a little later, okay?

07:26.272 --> 07:29.366
Everything is becoming
very clear,

07:29.441 --> 07:32.604
very familiar.

07:32.645 --> 07:35.273
Just what you'd expect from a
place where you've been before.

07:35.314 --> 07:39.307
Breathe deep, take your time.

07:39.351 --> 07:43.014
You're beginning now to become
aware of your surroundings.

07:43.055 --> 07:46.286
Good, good.

07:46.325 --> 07:48.259
Look down at your feet.

07:48.294 --> 07:50.660
Tell me what you see.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.391
l see boots.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.989
What kind of boots?

07:54.033 --> 07:55.967
Cowboy boots with spurs.

07:56.001 --> 07:57.992
And what do you hear?

08:00.606 --> 08:03.598
l hear guns.

08:03.642 --> 08:04.802
Yee-ha!

08:04.843 --> 08:06.470
l hear horses.

08:12.818 --> 08:14.786
All right,
keep your family heirlooms

08:14.820 --> 08:15.787
in the family.

08:15.821 --> 08:17.083
All l want is your money.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.352
l do mean all of it, and l want
everything that belongs

08:19.458 --> 08:21.722
to Mr. Wells and Mr. Fargo.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.455
Thank you kindly, sir.

08:23.495 --> 08:25.963
You're not in the least
bit welcome, Billy McCoy.

08:25.998 --> 08:29.263
Aw, l'm afraid you got me
mistaken with another character.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.599
Oh, no.
Everyone in this territory

08:31.637 --> 08:33.264
knows who you are, Billy,

08:33.304 --> 08:35.773
and how big that price
is on your head.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.866
Gun or no gun,

08:37.909 --> 08:40.003
justice will be served.

08:44.015 --> 08:45.847
See that,
you see what you've done?!

08:45.884 --> 08:47.818
You done upset this pretty
little thing over here,

08:47.853 --> 08:49.548
and you got me all riled up.

08:51.123 --> 08:53.683
You got nothing
to be afraid of, sugar.

08:53.726 --> 08:56.695
l would never harm
a hair on the head

08:56.729 --> 08:59.527
of anything as fetching and
sweet-smelling as yourself.

09:02.101 --> 09:03.693
Geez, Zeke, why don't you

09:03.736 --> 09:05.704
give the troops
a little warning next time!

09:05.738 --> 09:09.333
You're so busy sweet-talking, l
might as well be by myself here.

09:09.441 --> 09:11.602
Will you cover me
while l load up?

09:15.047 --> 09:17.208
Thank you.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.882
Lord have mercy,
we have hit the mother lode.

09:23.922 --> 09:25.355
Send a wire to old Jeff Davis,

09:25.424 --> 09:28.154
tell him the stars and bars
are back in business.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.751
Ow!

09:29.795 --> 09:31.353
Oh, now see, was that worth
losing your hand for,

09:31.397 --> 09:32.864
to protect somebody else's
money?

09:32.898 --> 09:34.957
l could've aimed higher and
put you in a grave, mister.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.231
Next time...
if there's a next time,

09:38.270 --> 09:41.137
there just won't be a next time.

09:41.173 --> 09:43.334
Hey, let's ride!

09:43.375 --> 09:44.706
Come on.

09:46.412 --> 09:49.404
Come on.
Hyah! Hyah!

09:53.452 --> 09:57.388
And so begins the legend,
the legend of Billy McCoy.

09:57.456 --> 10:01.153
A runaway, fresh off the farm
from Cody County.

10:01.193 --> 10:04.492
A kid with a quick draw,
a quick temper

10:04.530 --> 10:07.055
and an understanding that
someday he'll probably die,

10:07.099 --> 10:09.897
with a bullet in his back.

10:09.935 --> 10:11.903
Before we go in there,

10:11.937 --> 10:13.871
l know you're trying
to build a reputation,

10:13.906 --> 10:15.897
but if it was me,
l'd keep it in my holster.

10:15.941 --> 10:18.501
Well, you just don't cheat
at cards, Huckleberry.

10:18.544 --> 10:20.671
l've never cheated at cards
in my entire life.

10:24.483 --> 10:27.418
Take my heart and take my ring

10:27.453 --> 10:33.790
l give my all to thee

10:33.826 --> 10:36.090
Take me for eternity...

10:36.128 --> 10:39.120
From Fort Atkinson all the way
down south to Abilene,

10:39.164 --> 10:42.258
there wasn't a saloon
he hadn't drunk at,

10:42.301 --> 10:45.395
or a heart he hadn't broken.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.428
Aura Lee!

10:47.539 --> 10:49.939
Not to mention
all the local gunslingers

10:49.975 --> 10:51.567
just dying to prove

10:51.610 --> 10:54.579
that they could outshoot
the fastest gun in the West.

10:54.613 --> 10:58.071
Maid of golden hair

10:58.117 --> 11:03.783
Sunshine came along with thee

11:03.822 --> 11:09.385
And swallows in the air

11:09.495 --> 11:12.293
Take my heart

11:12.331 --> 11:16.392
And take my ring

11:16.435 --> 11:21.634
l give my all to thee

11:21.673 --> 11:23.937
Take me...

11:23.976 --> 11:26.638
Zeke! Get down!

11:26.678 --> 11:29.306
What's happening, Billy?

11:29.348 --> 11:31.009
What are you seeing?

11:31.049 --> 11:32.414
Tell me what you're seeing.

11:32.451 --> 11:34.749
lt's a mess.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.048
lt's a bloody mess.

11:39.091 --> 11:41.218
l'm bleeding.

11:42.895 --> 11:44.988
Come on, son, we gotta go.

11:45.030 --> 11:47.021
Come on, let's go.

11:50.235 --> 11:51.964
You wanted to be an outlaw,
kid--

11:52.004 --> 11:53.767
you got what you wanted
in spades.

11:53.805 --> 11:54.829
Can you ride?

11:54.873 --> 11:56.932
Hell, Zeke, they shot me,
not my horse.

11:56.975 --> 11:59.170
lf you weren't so quick
on that trigger,

11:59.211 --> 12:02.703
l'd shoot you myself and give
the reward to the Comanches.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.109
Aw, l'll be back.

12:07.152 --> 12:09.484
l'll be here.

12:22.901 --> 12:25.301
You're smiling.

12:25.337 --> 12:27.828
Well, it's not every day
you get to reinvent yourself.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.602
ln a cavern

12:29.641 --> 12:32.201
ln a canyon

12:32.244 --> 12:36.112
Excavating for a mine

12:36.148 --> 12:38.981
-Dwell a miner, forty-niner
-Word spread pretty quickly.

12:39.017 --> 12:40.382
-And his daughter
-ln every town they knew

12:40.419 --> 12:42.751
-Clementine
-the outlaw Billy McCoy.

12:42.788 --> 12:44.915
-Oh, my darling
-Him and his gang.

12:44.957 --> 12:47.755
-Oh, my darling
-Had his favorite whiskey.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.818
-Oh, my darling, Clementine
-Had his favorite girl.

12:49.861 --> 12:52.295
-You are lost and gone forever
-Her name was Dixie.

12:52.331 --> 12:55.300
-Dreadful sorry, Clementine
-At least that's what she said.

12:55.334 --> 12:56.767
Didn't matter
what they called her,

12:56.802 --> 12:58.702
-She drove ducklings
-she was beautiful.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.728
To the water every morning...

13:07.045 --> 13:09.343
l sing for them, but...

13:09.381 --> 13:11.008
l save it for you.

13:11.049 --> 13:13.381
Yeah, well,
save it for someone else.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.117
You're the only one
who matters, Billy.

13:23.161 --> 13:26.153
You're the real McCoy.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.390
Molly...

13:30.502 --> 13:33.596
l'm looking down at the street,

13:33.639 --> 13:37.769
and l see the girl
from the stagecoach.

13:37.809 --> 13:40.505
lt's Kelly Taylor.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.010
All right, all right.

13:44.049 --> 13:47.416
Hold on to that image, Dylan,

13:47.486 --> 13:51.217
and breathe through it...

13:51.256 --> 13:55.090
and let it take you
wherever it's gonna go.

14:01.199 --> 14:02.461
Nat,

14:02.501 --> 14:04.969
how am l supposed to put up
a campaign poster in here

14:05.003 --> 14:06.630
if l'm not having any
this time around?

14:06.672 --> 14:07.900
l don't know, Brandon.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.668
You're the candidate, not me.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.608
All right, look,
if it's any consolation,

14:11.643 --> 14:13.543
Valerie's insisting
l have the victory party

14:13.578 --> 14:15.739
at the After Dark--
that is, of course,

14:15.781 --> 14:17.373
assuming that l get reelected.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.145
You know something, Brandon?

14:19.184 --> 14:21.049
l hate it when you're humble.

14:21.086 --> 14:23.213
-Whew!
-Wha...? Nat!

14:23.255 --> 14:25.587
What'd l say?
What's your problem?

14:26.758 --> 14:29.022
l guess l never realized

14:29.061 --> 14:31.029
that this regression therapy
stuff is so heavy.

14:31.063 --> 14:32.655
Oh, hell, yes.

14:32.698 --> 14:34.893
She takes you back in time,
Valerie.

14:34.933 --> 14:37.868
The past comes alive
right inside your head.

14:37.903 --> 14:40.030
Well, l guess when
you're not involved,

14:40.072 --> 14:41.733
it just seems so... out there.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.001
l'll tell you
something,

14:43.041 --> 14:46.408
even if this is all just
a total load of B.S.,

14:46.478 --> 14:49.936
when you're going through it,
it's the real deal.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.781
Come on, now, Billy,

14:53.819 --> 14:56.117
don't lose your focus.

14:57.789 --> 15:01.281
l mean, it's like every
Western movie you've ever seen,

15:01.326 --> 15:04.056
only this isn't the Ponderosa,

15:04.096 --> 15:06.155
it's something
completely different.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.790
Make it quick, boys. Let's go!

15:07.833 --> 15:11.599
You traveling with an army now,
McCoy?

15:11.636 --> 15:13.627
Can't pull all those big jobs
by yourself anymore?

15:13.672 --> 15:16.300
All that rotgut
finally get to you?

15:16.341 --> 15:18.707
Who in the hell are you?

15:18.744 --> 15:20.712
You don't recognize me?

15:20.746 --> 15:22.907
Well, maybe
you'll recognize this.

15:22.948 --> 15:24.347
l do that?

15:24.383 --> 15:28.149
Maybe this time l ought to
put you out of your misery.

15:28.186 --> 15:30.620
Without those guns,
you ain't half a man.

15:30.655 --> 15:33.215
Keep talking--
it's your funeral, square head.

15:33.258 --> 15:34.816
He ain't worth it, kid.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.327
He ain't worth the blood,

15:36.361 --> 15:38.795
-he ain't worth the effort.
-Don't move.

15:38.830 --> 15:41.128
Ace, are we getting all
the gold in the world?

15:41.166 --> 15:42.394
All the silver, too.

15:42.434 --> 15:44.231
That's my money.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.863
Excuse the inconvenience,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.998
Please, give my best
to Mr. Wells

15:49.040 --> 15:50.735
-and Mr. Fargo.
-Take that, you scoundrel!

15:51.843 --> 15:53.276
What the hell?!

15:54.780 --> 15:56.179
Why'd he do that?

15:56.214 --> 15:58.114
lt don't matter.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.708
Let's ride, people!
Let's go!

15:59.751 --> 16:01.218
Go! Go! Go!

16:02.154 --> 16:03.746
That's right.

16:03.789 --> 16:04.949
Pay him no mind!

16:04.990 --> 16:07.686
He was only a family man
with little children!

16:07.726 --> 16:09.523
He ain't worth nothin'--
just another notch

16:09.561 --> 16:13.497
on the belt of the
legendary Billy McCoy!

16:21.306 --> 16:24.742
Come on downstairs, honey.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.744
Everyone's asking for you.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.509
Zeke says that hayseed
should've never drawn on you.

16:30.549 --> 16:32.540
He says you had no choice.

16:32.584 --> 16:35.018
l had a choice.

16:35.053 --> 16:37.851
You always have a choice.

16:44.596 --> 16:46.757
Stay with me tonight, Billy.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.277
Hey, McCoy!

17:03.315 --> 17:05.579
McCoy, look what we got here.

17:05.617 --> 17:07.016
We got us a Cheyenne!

17:07.051 --> 17:08.541
You sure he's not a Comanche?

17:08.587 --> 17:10.349
l want to get me a Comanche.

17:10.387 --> 17:13.516
He's no Comanche--
but he's a good dancer.

17:21.199 --> 17:22.665
Are you okay?

17:22.701 --> 17:23.929
l think so.

17:23.969 --> 17:30.272
Can you describe
what you're seeing?

17:30.308 --> 17:35.075
l'm in an lndian sweat lodge
with Brandon Walsh.

17:37.682 --> 17:41.015
-Do you know why you're there?
-Yeah, l do.

17:42.821 --> 17:44.846
l said it's enough!

17:48.226 --> 17:49.591
You'd do this for an lndian?

17:49.628 --> 17:51.095
l'd do it for a man.

17:52.964 --> 17:55.262
Did you ever think
it'd come to this?

18:10.115 --> 18:12.640
You speak any English?

18:14.319 --> 18:16.412
Hell, it don't matter.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.354
Take his arm, now.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.585
We gotcha now.
Come along with us.

18:22.627 --> 18:24.618
We'll get you something to eat.

18:25.964 --> 18:28.364
They would've killed him
if you hadn't come along.

18:28.466 --> 18:30.263
There's been enough killing.

18:30.302 --> 18:31.894
A sentiment l hold dear

18:31.937 --> 18:34.371
but wouldn't have expected
to hear from an outlaw.

18:34.472 --> 18:36.497
Hey, l've seen you before.

18:36.541 --> 18:37.974
Yeah.

18:38.009 --> 18:39.874
You were on that stage
from Abilene.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.175
Had your head buried
in your mama's lap.

18:42.213 --> 18:43.840
That was a long time ago.

18:43.882 --> 18:46.908
Yes, it was.

18:46.952 --> 18:49.386
Do you think a person
could change?

18:49.421 --> 18:50.888
With all my heart.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.186
Do you think l could change?

18:53.224 --> 18:54.851
l pray that you can.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.656
Otherwise, it would be

18:56.695 --> 19:00.153
a tragic waste of a life
to spend your time on this earth

19:00.198 --> 19:03.031
in a haze
of alcohol and gunpowder.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.763
And as he looked
in her soft blue eyes,

19:09.808 --> 19:11.639
he knew right then and there

19:11.676 --> 19:14.338
that his days
as an outlaw were over,

19:14.412 --> 19:18.576
and that the next phase
of his life was about to begin.

19:18.617 --> 19:22.747
There were lots of lazy picnics
by the pond that summer,

19:22.787 --> 19:25.881
where she would read to him
from the Scriptures

19:25.924 --> 19:28.950
and fill his heart with hope...

19:28.994 --> 19:31.656
and eventually, love.

19:39.504 --> 19:41.301
But as to be expected,

19:41.339 --> 19:43.637
not everyone was pleased
with the change

19:43.675 --> 19:45.506
that had taken place.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.946
Where you been, kid?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.140
Around.

19:50.181 --> 19:52.172
Anywhere but here.

19:54.686 --> 19:57.280
What is this, an ambush?

19:57.322 --> 20:01.258
There's a train
left Lockaloma County yesterday.

20:01.292 --> 20:04.193
We were gonna ride out
and greet it.

20:04.229 --> 20:05.662
Or did you forget that?

20:05.697 --> 20:06.959
Timing ain't right.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.967
Timing got nothing
to do with it, McCoy.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.992
We want to know--

20:12.037 --> 20:14.028
are you in or out?

20:15.073 --> 20:18.440
lf you need me, l'll be there.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.378
Then it's settled.

20:24.315 --> 20:28.012
But Dixie knew that,
in fact, nothing was settled

20:28.053 --> 20:33.047
and that everything that ever
mattered didn't matter no more.

20:41.599 --> 20:44.432
All right, boys,
let's go rob a train.

20:44.502 --> 20:46.436
Hyah! Hyah!

20:46.504 --> 20:48.870
And by the time Zeke
and the boys

20:48.907 --> 20:50.602
rode off to greet that train,

20:50.642 --> 20:52.735
she and Billy
were 30 miles north,

20:52.777 --> 20:54.244
headed in the opposite direction

20:54.279 --> 20:57.874
to start a new life... together.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.817
ls it safe?

21:03.855 --> 21:06.619
Yeah. Molly left
about a half hour ago.

21:06.658 --> 21:10.219
Look who l picked up
along the way.

21:10.261 --> 21:11.956
So, how was your regression?

21:11.996 --> 21:14.123
Was it, like,
a cosmic experience?

21:14.165 --> 21:16.497
l'd really rather not
go into it right now.

21:16.534 --> 21:17.501
Come on, Dylan.

21:17.535 --> 21:18.797
Give me a little tidbit

21:18.837 --> 21:20.862
from the highlight reel
to whet my appetite.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.133
Look, you want
to know what happened?!

21:22.173 --> 21:23.401
You really want
to know what happened?!

21:23.441 --> 21:25.238
l found out something,
l found out l was going

21:25.276 --> 21:26.538
straight to hell
till Kelly Taylor

21:26.578 --> 21:27.806
came into the picture, okay?

21:27.846 --> 21:31.145
So you and Kelly have...
like, a seminal link?

21:31.182 --> 21:34.276
Molly said it's as strong as
anything she's ever channeled.

21:34.319 --> 21:37.152
Oh, far out!

21:37.188 --> 21:38.815
What does this
''seminal link'' mean?

21:38.857 --> 21:43.123
lt means that Dylan and Kelly
are soul mates, for life.

21:45.997 --> 21:47.794
So finally
l pulled Bender aside,

21:47.832 --> 21:50.665
and asked him point-blank
why am l not in the loop.

21:50.702 --> 21:52.226
Well, what did he say?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.932
He said some questions
are better left unanswered.

21:54.973 --> 21:57.066
Hey, guys. How's it going?

21:57.108 --> 21:58.405
-Hey.
-Hi, honey.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.343
So, how's life on
the campaign trail?

22:00.378 --> 22:02.312
Not too terrible--
the editorial board

22:02.347 --> 22:04.315
at ''The Condor'' endorsed
my candidacy today.

22:04.349 --> 22:05.338
Hey, congratulations.

22:05.383 --> 22:06.350
Six months ago,

22:06.384 --> 22:07.373
they demanded my resignation.

22:07.418 --> 22:08.976
Now they want
to be best friends.

22:09.020 --> 22:10.578
Everybody loves a winner.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.249
Ain't it the truth?

22:14.025 --> 22:15.515
Well, after l get the ax,

22:15.560 --> 22:17.824
maybe Brandon can help me
get a job teaching

22:17.862 --> 22:19.193
at the business school.

22:33.711 --> 22:36.441
Uh, come in!

22:38.316 --> 22:39.544
You okay?

22:39.584 --> 22:40.846
Yeah.

22:40.885 --> 22:42.910
Good.

22:42.954 --> 22:45.422
Hey, Brandon.

22:47.192 --> 22:49.126
Do you think
you have a soul mate?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.253
You mean, like...
in the universe?

22:51.296 --> 22:52.263
Yeah.

22:52.297 --> 22:55.698
What l want to know is...

22:55.733 --> 22:58.293
do you think Kelly is like
your soul mate for life?

22:58.336 --> 23:00.304
How much incense you been

23:00.338 --> 23:01.464
burning up here?

23:01.506 --> 23:02.495
Come on. l'm serious.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.734
Well, l'm not planning on

23:03.775 --> 23:05.743
going out and getting
married tomorrow,

23:05.777 --> 23:07.369
but l do see a future there,

23:07.478 --> 23:08.911
yeah.

23:08.947 --> 23:10.847
Why can't they all be like you?

23:10.882 --> 23:12.076
All who?

23:12.116 --> 23:14.380
The guys l know.

23:14.419 --> 23:16.011
Like, uh,
Charley the screenwriter?

23:17.322 --> 23:20.189
l saw you two
at the Peach Pit today.

23:20.225 --> 23:21.214
And you didn't say hello?

23:21.259 --> 23:22.920
l'm insulted.

23:22.961 --> 23:26.124
Well, you seemed
very verbally entangled.

23:26.164 --> 23:27.893
And l'm sure Kelly told you
to keep your distance, right?

23:27.932 --> 23:29.763
She may have mentioned
something.

23:29.801 --> 23:32.361
Let's face it,

23:32.403 --> 23:34.633
Kelly's not going to be
satisfied until she has

23:34.672 --> 23:36.230
the whole clique against me.

23:36.274 --> 23:39.675
And you know why, right?

23:39.711 --> 23:46.549
When l moved here, before l knew
you guys were together...

23:46.584 --> 23:51.214
l confided in her and told her
that by the end of the year,

23:51.256 --> 23:56.558
my goal was to have you look at
me and not think of your sister.

23:56.594 --> 24:00.052
Well, l think we're way past
that point, Val.

24:00.098 --> 24:02.225
Except for my first night
in Beverly Hills

24:02.267 --> 24:04.792
when we were talking
in the bathroom,

24:04.836 --> 24:07.930
do you realize that we've
never touched each other?

24:07.972 --> 24:09.462
Not even once.

24:09.507 --> 24:11.532
Sure we have.

24:12.877 --> 24:13.901
Haven't we?

24:13.945 --> 24:15.572
We've never even grazed an elbow

24:15.613 --> 24:17.604
or slapped a high five

24:17.649 --> 24:19.378
or put a head
on each other's shoulder.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.716
So you have a burning desire
to put your head on my shoulder?

24:22.754 --> 24:25.848
l just hope Kelly appreciates
what she has.

24:28.493 --> 24:29.960
So do l.

24:34.966 --> 24:36.627
Come here.

24:53.718 --> 24:56.243
Clare, David, are you decent?

24:56.287 --> 24:57.549
Not particularly.

24:57.588 --> 24:59.180
Come in.

24:59.223 --> 25:01.214
So,

25:01.259 --> 25:02.886
you guys up for some sushi?

25:02.927 --> 25:06.226
Yeah, l can go for some
tobico with quail egg.

25:06.264 --> 25:08.596
And l thought for dessert, we'd
do some rock-and-roll bowling.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.497
Yuki's?

25:09.534 --> 25:10.626
Whoki's?

25:10.668 --> 25:11.794
Yuki's Bowl-a-rama.

25:11.836 --> 25:13.497
We used to go there
all the time last year.

25:13.538 --> 25:15.005
lt's this place downtown.
lt's awesome.

25:15.039 --> 25:16.370
Yeah, and Ray hasn't been there
either, so...

25:16.407 --> 25:17.601
Hey.

25:19.110 --> 25:20.475
And l must warn you,
Ray is a ringer.

25:20.511 --> 25:21.808
He even knows
his bowling average.

25:21.846 --> 25:23.143
Wait, wait a second.

25:23.181 --> 25:25.513
What time's Betsy's
surprise party?

25:25.550 --> 25:26.710
ls that tonight?

25:26.751 --> 25:28.309
Oh, my, we are so late!

25:28.353 --> 25:30.253
Come on. We gotta go.
l'm sorry, Don.

25:30.288 --> 25:31.380
l forgot, totally.

25:31.456 --> 25:33.014
Well, maybe we can
hook up after the party.

25:33.057 --> 25:34.388
Oh, knowing Betsy,

25:34.459 --> 25:36.620
it's probably gonna
be pretty late, so...

25:36.661 --> 25:37.889
Maybe you can leave early?

25:38.930 --> 25:41.558
Look, if they're busy,
they're busy.

25:41.599 --> 25:44.193
Okay, but l'm disappointed.

25:44.235 --> 25:45.293
Sorry.

25:49.207 --> 25:52.404
So... this Betsy chick,

25:52.443 --> 25:54.070
she's not really having
a party, is she?

25:54.112 --> 25:55.306
Couldn't tell you.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.576
l don't really know anyone
by the name of Betsy.

25:58.583 --> 25:59.675
How's Valerie doing, Ray?

25:59.717 --> 26:01.275
l wouldn't know, Clare.

26:01.319 --> 26:02.684
Good.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.711
Keep it that way.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.886
Hello, hello, hello.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.727
Yeah, hello.
ls this New York City?

26:14.766 --> 26:15.892
Yes, it is.

26:15.933 --> 26:17.696
l knew l was gonna
hear from you today.

26:17.735 --> 26:19.259
What are you, a psychic?

26:19.303 --> 26:20.895
You've been on my mind all day.

26:20.938 --> 26:22.371
Well, that's encouraging

26:22.440 --> 26:24.931
since l haven't been able to get
you out of my thoughts either.

26:24.976 --> 26:26.375
l don't know what it is,

26:26.444 --> 26:28.571
but something about New York
reminds me of you.

26:28.613 --> 26:30.376
Must be a sign.

26:30.415 --> 26:32.349
Yeah, that l am in desperate
need of sleep.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.874
Or maybe it's a deja vu.

26:34.919 --> 26:37.149
Yes, that must be what it is.

26:39.857 --> 26:41.586
l'm sorry.
l'm just so wiped out,

26:41.626 --> 26:43.617
l'm getting slaphappy.

26:43.661 --> 26:45.822
Oh, can you hold on a second?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.791
Hey, if you want to meet up

26:50.835 --> 26:52.325
with those agency people,
we gotta jam.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.099
Yeah, l'm just on the phone
to L.A. Let me get off.

26:54.138 --> 26:57.904
lf that's Brandon,
give him my regards, okay?

26:57.942 --> 27:00.570
Look, l don't care
what time it is,

27:00.611 --> 27:02.806
when you get back in,
you gotta call me, okay?

27:02.847 --> 27:04.337
l will. l promise. Bye.

27:04.382 --> 27:06.577
Okay. Kel?

27:19.564 --> 27:22.032
You know, all semester,
when l'd order a latte,

27:22.066 --> 27:24.364
l'd fret about where
l was gonna find

27:24.469 --> 27:26.096
a good cup of coffee in Boise.

27:26.137 --> 27:28.605
All that fretting
for naught, eh?

27:28.639 --> 27:29.628
You know, the irony is,

27:29.674 --> 27:30.971
l actually started
getting excited

27:31.008 --> 27:32.600
about the prospect
of leaving L.A.,

27:32.643 --> 27:34.770
which we still might do.
Who knows?

27:34.812 --> 27:36.370
Ah, whatever we do,
we'll do it together.

27:36.447 --> 27:37.379
Doing what together?

27:37.482 --> 27:38.642
Living life.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.651
You know, l think
l might start doing that

27:40.685 --> 27:42.653
if l get out of this election
in one piece.

27:42.687 --> 27:44.746
Please. You haven't even
broken a sweat yet.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.019
You know, in about two minutes,

27:47.058 --> 27:49.151
l'm gonna do a live interview
with Walter Chen,

27:49.193 --> 27:52.492
and just for you, l'm gonna make
sure that l start perspiring.

27:52.530 --> 27:55.090
Oh, you'd do that for me?
What a guy.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.998
What can l tell you?
l'm a saint.

27:57.034 --> 27:58.797
Hey, where are you
going with my latte?

27:58.836 --> 28:01.202
Your son is too much.

28:02.707 --> 28:04.265
Do you really think he has
this election in the bag?

28:04.308 --> 28:07.277
For Brandon to lose,

28:07.311 --> 28:09.745
it would take a twist
of cataclysmic proportion.

28:12.884 --> 28:15.512
How you doing, guys?
Good to see you.

28:15.553 --> 28:19.922
Well, if it isn't my favorite
volunteer stage manager.

28:19.957 --> 28:21.185
Be careful, all right?

28:21.225 --> 28:22.692
Something major's going on.

28:22.727 --> 28:24.718
What do you mean
''something major''?

28:24.762 --> 28:27.128
All l know is someone sent
Walter a fax from Sacramento.

28:27.165 --> 28:29.133
Ever since,
he's been running around

28:29.167 --> 28:32.500
like a mix of Ted Koppel
and Wendy Tokuda, all right?

28:39.377 --> 28:40.901
Welcome to ''CU Later,'' Brandon.

28:40.945 --> 28:42.378
lt's good to have you back.

28:42.446 --> 28:44.346
Thank you, Walter.
lt's good to be back.

28:44.382 --> 28:47.078
Brandon, are you aware that the
University Board of Trustees

28:47.118 --> 28:49.143
is convening this morning
to announce

28:49.187 --> 28:53.248
that tuition for undergraduates
will be raised by 15%%

28:53.291 --> 28:55.384
next semester?

29:02.233 --> 29:04.201
Dean, the tuition increase
was supposed

29:04.235 --> 29:05.634
to be a worst-case scenario,

29:05.670 --> 29:07.729
a last resort after the
Board of Trustees exhausted

29:07.772 --> 29:09.433
all other ways
of raising revenue.

29:09.473 --> 29:12.067
Look, Brandon, everyone
from the chancellor on down

29:12.109 --> 29:13.599
got screwed over on this one,

29:13.644 --> 29:15.475
but we're dealing
with a legislature

29:15.513 --> 29:17.447
that's determined to reduce
the size of government,

29:17.481 --> 29:19.472
and all of us are just going
to have

29:19.517 --> 29:20.984
to learn to tighten
our belts for a while.

29:21.018 --> 29:22.576
But the election is tomorrow.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.520
Brandon,
no one in their right mind

29:24.555 --> 29:27.251
would hold you accountable
for these tuition increases.

29:32.263 --> 29:34.356
This tuition hike is a rip-off,

29:34.398 --> 29:37.162
a scam brought to you courtesy
of the Board of Trustees.

29:37.201 --> 29:38.759
l just want to know one thing...

29:38.803 --> 29:41.271
Brandon, if you knew
an increase was in the offing,

29:41.305 --> 29:42.363
you should've gone public.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.771
You should've raised hell.

29:43.808 --> 29:45.298
l never thought they'd do it.

29:45.343 --> 29:46.640
Well, they did it,

29:46.677 --> 29:49.168
and you blew it because
emotions are running high

29:49.213 --> 29:52.182
and the chances of any
incumbent getting reelected

29:52.216 --> 29:54.343
at this point ain't great.

29:54.385 --> 29:56.717
Especially with Alex running
as a write-in candidate.

29:56.754 --> 29:57.880
ls that official?

29:57.922 --> 29:59.617
lt's inevitable. Look at him.

29:59.657 --> 30:01.284
He won't even look me
in the eye.

30:01.325 --> 30:02.758
He grins, while we bear it?

30:02.793 --> 30:04.488
l don't think so.

30:04.528 --> 30:06.291
Well, if it's any consolation,

30:06.330 --> 30:09.390
l'm still voting
for you, Brandon.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.491
Thanks, Janice.

30:10.534 --> 30:11.728
Take care.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.236
All right, you, too.

30:14.672 --> 30:17.573
So, have you heard any good
tuition jokes lately?

30:17.608 --> 30:19.735
Only the big one
that's being played on me.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.642
Well, at least you're going out
in style.

30:21.679 --> 30:22.771
Yeah, tarred and feathered.

30:22.813 --> 30:24.974
No, on a ruby red carpet
at the Peach Pit After Dark.

30:25.016 --> 30:26.347
Valerie,
you really don't have to...

30:26.384 --> 30:27.851
l promised you a night
you'd remember,

30:27.885 --> 30:29.876
and l always keep my promises.
Who knows?

30:29.920 --> 30:32.252
l may even get you
on that dance floor.

30:33.524 --> 30:35.321
lf l win, l'll dance.

30:35.359 --> 30:36.587
Ooh!

30:36.627 --> 30:37.992
Well, then
l'd better get out there

30:38.029 --> 30:38.996
and start stuffing
those ballots.

30:39.030 --> 30:40.258
You'd do that for me?

30:40.298 --> 30:42.027
ln a New York minute.

30:51.776 --> 30:55.109
l love New York...
the people, the energy.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.340
lt's so not L.A.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.678
Hey, don't knock L.A.

30:58.716 --> 31:00.650
lt's had enough bumps
over the last two years.

31:00.685 --> 31:04.052
And somebody's a very popular
young lady, l must say.

31:04.088 --> 31:05.646
Are those
from the Palmer Agency?

31:05.690 --> 31:10.093
No. Dylan... Dylan...

31:10.127 --> 31:11.924
-Dylan?
-Dylan...

31:11.962 --> 31:13.793
You got something going on
with that guy again?

31:13.831 --> 31:15.696
l have no idea what's going on.

31:21.038 --> 31:25.031
Molly, you gotta help me here.

31:25.076 --> 31:27.806
l know you got a life, l know
you have people and everything,

31:27.845 --> 31:29.710
but listen, l gotta get
back to that moment,

31:29.747 --> 31:32.272
the exact moment when Kelly
and l rode off into the sunset.

31:32.316 --> 31:36.047
Wait, Dylan, l don't even know
if l can do that,

31:36.087 --> 31:38.419
and frankly,
l just don't understand.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.717
l mean, what, what's all
the urgency about this for?

31:40.758 --> 31:43.420
Look, you told me
the woman is my soul mate,

31:43.494 --> 31:45.086
that we have some kind
of seminal link,

31:45.129 --> 31:47.893
and l gotta tell you, the final
images l had of my life...

31:47.932 --> 31:49.331
it doesn't jibe with the way

31:49.367 --> 31:51.858
l feel about myself or Kelly
or anything.

31:51.902 --> 31:55.065
Okay, look,
we can go back in time.

31:55.106 --> 31:58.542
We've done that, we know that,
that's not the issue here.

31:58.576 --> 32:02.637
The issue here is...
what are we looking for?

32:16.761 --> 32:18.786
Keep breathing, Dylan.

32:20.965 --> 32:23.593
lt'll all come back to you.

32:23.634 --> 32:28.037
You've been here before.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.403
Good.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.366
Keep breathing.

32:33.411 --> 32:39.247
Keep going deeper
and deeper and deeper.

32:40.918 --> 32:44.410
Good. Where are you?

32:47.992 --> 32:51.758
lt's still the West,
but it's not the same.

32:51.796 --> 32:53.787
How do you know that?

32:53.831 --> 32:59.030
Well, it's a Sunday,
and l'm with my children.

32:59.069 --> 33:01.003
l'm coming out of a church,
of all places.

33:02.973 --> 33:04.668
ls Kelly with you?

33:04.708 --> 33:06.699
Yeah, she is.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.769
l was just telling
Reverend Parsons

33:09.814 --> 33:11.213
how much you enjoyed his sermon.

33:11.248 --> 33:13.614
Yes. Well, ''Without redemption,
we are all but wolves

33:13.651 --> 33:16.245
howling at the gates
of the kingdom of the Lord.''

33:16.287 --> 33:18.050
Jedadiah loves the Good Book.

33:18.088 --> 33:19.385
Perhaps, one of these Sundays,

33:19.490 --> 33:21.185
we might bring him
up to the pulpit.

33:21.225 --> 33:23.090
Well, l'm afraid
that's a bit unlikely,

33:23.127 --> 33:24.321
Reverend.

33:24.361 --> 33:25.988
Not as unlikely as he may think.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.759
Marshall Southwith,

33:27.798 --> 33:29.493
Mrs. Southwith.

33:29.533 --> 33:31.763
Good day, Reverend.

33:31.802 --> 33:36.102
Mrs. Addison asked for our
company at supper tonight,

33:36.140 --> 33:37.767
and l accepted without realizing

33:37.808 --> 33:40.470
that both your deputies
are out of town.

33:46.851 --> 33:49.285
How in God's name
did he find you?

33:49.320 --> 33:52.221
Zeke always could
follow a trail,

33:52.256 --> 33:53.746
even when it got cold.

33:53.791 --> 33:57.659
Jedadiah, you tell him
to keep on riding.

33:57.695 --> 34:00.255
You tell him he's not wanted
in this town.

34:00.297 --> 34:01.924
Take the young'uns home.

34:03.934 --> 34:05.799
Come on, boys.

34:14.078 --> 34:15.375
Zeke.

34:15.446 --> 34:17.380
-Hello, Billy.
-lt's been a long time

34:17.481 --> 34:19.380
-since anybody called me that.
-That's right.

34:19.416 --> 34:21.281
They call you Marshall now,
don't they?

34:21.318 --> 34:23.980
l'm not wearing a gun anymore.

34:24.021 --> 34:27.149
l didn't come this far
to fight with you, kid.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.318
l came here
'cause Dixie's in trouble.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.588
What kind of trouble?

34:30.628 --> 34:32.357
The kind where they put
a noose around your neck.

34:32.396 --> 34:33.726
What's the charge?

34:33.764 --> 34:35.254
Don't matter.

34:35.299 --> 34:36.527
Only thing
she was ever guilty of,

34:36.567 --> 34:38.501
other than being born
a half-breed,

34:38.536 --> 34:40.629
was not sleeping
with the right men.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.797
And not giving them
the deed to her saloon.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.967
Dixie begged me to let
you be, kid, but l told her

34:46.010 --> 34:49.639
l had a hunch that, uh,
we could still count on you.

35:12.236 --> 35:15.694
l don't begrudge you for doing
what you can to right a wrong,

35:15.739 --> 35:19.869
but these people from your past,

35:19.910 --> 35:22.071
they never met the man l love.

35:22.112 --> 35:25.411
They've never seen you
with your sons.

35:32.356 --> 35:36.850
Promise me this isn't
the last time you'll hold me.

35:39.430 --> 35:42.058
lt won't be the last time.

35:42.099 --> 35:43.589
l promise.

35:53.844 --> 35:58.304
And, as he rode away that day,
both of them were keenly aware

35:58.349 --> 36:00.010
that this could be

36:00.050 --> 36:02.883
the last time
they would ever see each other.

36:25.509 --> 36:27.136
Line up, everybody!

36:27.177 --> 36:29.839
The circus is in town!

36:33.517 --> 36:34.916
Line up! Line up!

36:34.952 --> 36:37.284
Galloping out of town
with bullets whizzing by,

36:37.321 --> 36:39.380
l didn't hardly realize
that everything

36:39.490 --> 36:40.957
had finally come full circle.

36:56.273 --> 36:57.763
Here you go, ma'am.

36:57.808 --> 36:59.776
San Francisco, huh?

36:59.810 --> 37:02.779
Where the railroad ends
and life begins.

37:02.813 --> 37:05.748
Yeah, well, l guess if
a dirty rotten scoundrel

37:05.783 --> 37:08.980
like Billy McCoy can get
a fresh start, anybody can.

37:09.019 --> 37:12.648
Spoken like a church deacon.

37:12.690 --> 37:14.624
No, l'm just a simple family man

37:14.658 --> 37:16.956
trying to do the best l can.

37:22.232 --> 37:25.861
Last train out of Redemption
City will be leaving...

37:25.903 --> 37:27.700
l can't take your money, Billy.

37:27.738 --> 37:31.401
lt's just my way of saying
good luck and God bless.

37:33.977 --> 37:37.208
...Flagstaff, Reno
and San Francisco

37:37.247 --> 37:39.374
can now board the train.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.918
lf you and the missus
ever get out to California,

37:41.952 --> 37:44.079
come and see me, yeah?

37:44.121 --> 37:46.749
Good-bye, Dixie.

37:53.664 --> 37:59.603
He killed my daddy!
He killed my daddy!

37:59.636 --> 38:02.696
l just shot the man
that killed my daddy! Whoo!

38:55.259 --> 38:58.353
-Molly?
-Yes, Dylan?

38:58.395 --> 39:01.523
What is Brandon Walsh doing
at this guy's funeral?

39:01.565 --> 39:04.659
Are you sure it was Brandon?

39:04.701 --> 39:07.465
Yes. l'm sure it was Brandon...

39:07.504 --> 39:09.495
and Donna...

39:12.743 --> 39:14.768
And Kelly?

39:14.812 --> 39:17.679
What the hell
is going on here, Molly?

39:17.714 --> 39:20.182
lt's probably nothing.

39:20.217 --> 39:22.447
Probably nothing,
but possibly something?

39:22.486 --> 39:24.977
Look, there's one thing you have
to understand here, Dylan.

39:25.022 --> 39:28.355
Theoretically, time is elastic.

39:28.458 --> 39:31.291
-So...?
-So, theoretically,

39:31.328 --> 39:33.091
there's not that much difference

39:33.130 --> 39:36.566
between a regression
and a premonition.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.502
Are you saying that
l left my past life,

39:40.537 --> 39:44.473
somehow jumped ahead
to the future to my own funeral?

39:44.508 --> 39:46.237
Theoretically, yes,

39:46.276 --> 39:49.336
it's possible, but the truth is,

39:49.379 --> 39:50.710
l don't know...

39:50.747 --> 39:53.375
l don't know.

39:53.450 --> 39:56.214
When l was a kid, my mom,

39:56.253 --> 39:58.778
she drug me to this palm reader.

39:58.822 --> 40:00.653
She said l didn't have
a very long lifeline.

40:00.691 --> 40:04.491
That l needed to make the best
use of whatever time l had here.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.292
l never thought about it much
until now.

40:26.116 --> 40:28.084
Some wild and crazy
victory party

40:28.118 --> 40:30.313
this turned out to be, huh?

40:30.354 --> 40:32.219
l feel so badly for you.

40:32.256 --> 40:35.191
Why? Just 'cause l
got trounced two-to-one

40:35.225 --> 40:36.590
by a write-in candidate?

40:36.627 --> 40:39.221
No. Because the write-in
candidate was Alex Diaz.

40:39.263 --> 40:40.389
Aw, look on the bright side.

40:40.430 --> 40:43.263
Alex has to deal with
the tuition, not me.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.832
Do you want to dance?

40:46.870 --> 40:50.806
Clare, l lost an election,
not my mind.

40:51.842 --> 40:54.777
Great food as always,
Mr. Bussichio.

40:54.811 --> 40:57.245
Thank you, sir.

40:57.281 --> 40:59.442
Well, you look rather bummed.

40:59.483 --> 41:03.852
Well,
l really wanted you to win.

41:03.887 --> 41:05.752
l got news for you.

41:05.789 --> 41:07.848
So did l.

41:10.227 --> 41:12.161
Like father, like son.

41:12.195 --> 41:13.389
Jim.

41:13.430 --> 41:14.590
No, l'm serious.
l came this close

41:14.631 --> 41:16.826
to submitting
my resignation today.

41:16.867 --> 41:19.267
Hey, did you guys try
the cannolis?

41:19.303 --> 41:21.567
-They are delicious.
-Uh...

41:21.605 --> 41:23.505
Honey, l think we'd better
go home.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.371
Your father
has a miserable headache.

41:25.409 --> 41:27.001
-Sorry.
-Oh. Come on.

41:27.044 --> 41:28.375
l'll walk you guys out, huh?

41:28.412 --> 41:30.141
Thanks, kid.

41:36.453 --> 41:37.420
Hey, guys.

41:37.454 --> 41:39.581
-See ya.
-Take care.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.750
Oh, poor Brandon.

41:41.792 --> 41:43.419
Aw, come on.

41:43.493 --> 41:45.256
A little humble pie
never hurt anybody.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.957
Listen to you.
What a sweetheart!

41:47.998 --> 41:49.556
Hey. You wouldn't be saying that

41:49.599 --> 41:51.590
if you heard me negotiating
on your behalf today.

41:51.635 --> 41:52.897
What do you mean, on my behalf?

41:52.936 --> 41:54.995
Well, it's my career, too.

41:55.038 --> 41:57.768
When they called and offered me
a teaching position

41:57.808 --> 41:59.366
at the Yale Law School,

41:59.409 --> 42:00.967
l made it clear
that your reacceptance

42:01.011 --> 42:02.638
as an undergraduate
was a major deal point.

42:02.679 --> 42:04.306
You said that?

42:04.348 --> 42:06.373
With your scholarship
reinstated.

42:06.483 --> 42:10.943
So what did they say?

42:10.988 --> 42:14.048
They said, thank you very much.

42:14.091 --> 42:15.683
Then they called back
15 minutes later

42:15.726 --> 42:17.057
and said it was a go.

42:21.298 --> 42:23.198
You mean Yale is an option?

42:25.402 --> 42:27.199
You're kidding!

42:27.237 --> 42:29.603
l can't believe that.

42:33.276 --> 42:35.267
After Dark.

42:35.312 --> 42:37.712
Yeah. Welcome back.

42:37.748 --> 42:39.716
Sure, he is. David!

42:39.750 --> 42:41.877
Tell Brandon it's Kelly.

42:41.918 --> 42:43.317
Hang on.

42:47.891 --> 42:49.552
lsn't it just like Kelly

42:49.593 --> 42:51.720
to call after
the polls have closed.

42:51.762 --> 42:54.356
What's the difference?

42:54.398 --> 42:56.798
There is no difference.

43:02.139 --> 43:04.130
Hello.

43:06.143 --> 43:08.304
l'm sorry, honey.
l'm so jet-lagged.

43:08.345 --> 43:10.711
l'm sorry about the election.

43:10.747 --> 43:12.112
l'm sorry l wasn't there
for you tonight.

43:12.149 --> 43:15.380
But l love you,
and l'll talk to you tomorrow.

43:15.419 --> 43:17.910
Okay. Night.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.758
Dylan. Hi.

43:32.803 --> 43:34.634
Hello, Kel.

43:34.671 --> 43:36.832
ls everything okay?

43:37.874 --> 43:42.174
Yeah. l've been thinking
about you a lot, and...
