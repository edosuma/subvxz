00:12.360 --> 00:15.640
82% of women
are in prison for nonviolent crimes.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.560
The justice system is rigged against them.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.960
All a women needs to do

00:20.040 --> 00:23.640
is teeter on the edges
of society's expectation of her.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.760
And what do we do? We bang her up,
often for no more than a misdemeanor.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.840
Case in point, what are you in here for?

00:29.920 --> 00:33.400
-Seven counts of battery and assault.
-That's a bad example. What about you?

00:33.480 --> 00:34.720
-Armed robbery.
-Nope.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.600
I had a dispute with an Uber driver.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.960
A dispute with an Uber driver.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.280
The little lady dared speak up,
and now she's in prison.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.560
He took the long way around,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.600
so I stabbed him in the neck,
left him for dead.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.120
Just cut this stuff out.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.720
Anyway, I won't keep you. <i>Hwyl fawr</i> .

01:07.200 --> 01:12.840
Now, while it's fresh in my mind,
I got "stout," "owls" and "maps."

01:12.920 --> 01:15.280
I definitely heard "Toffifee."

01:15.360 --> 01:16.760
Let's try and make that happen.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.520
It is incredibly important to me
that my inmates are heard.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.720
And I put my hands up, I don't always
understand what Sian is saying.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Hey, Laura!

01:27.560 --> 01:28.560
<i>Or ever.</i>

01:28.640 --> 01:29.920
Hi, Laura.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.400
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:31.480 --> 01:33.320
Probably as well as any I know.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.800
Good times.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.120
But it's not Sian's responsibility
to make herself understood.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.800
It is my responsibility to understand her.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.200
I snapped at her the other day
and I feel very bad about that.

01:44.280 --> 01:48.320
So I'm going to make it up to her.
Enter Ioan.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.400
I don't know why
I didn't think of this before.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.720
He is a guard from a sister prison,
and he's Welsh.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.280
And he's agreed to come down
and act as translator.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.200
He's from a valley in Wales,
and so is Sian, probably.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.960
So that should work out quite well.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.000
We've been emailing back and forth.
Some very good bants.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.240
And as you can see, he's quite a dish.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.640
Yum-yum.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.080
Are we single?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.400
-I decided to put my career first.
-Did you?

02:16.480 --> 02:17.960
Not this career.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.040
<i>Writing and performing</i>
<i>our own musical is a challenge,</i>

02:28.120 --> 02:31.280
but I'm really impressed
the way everyone's got on board.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.960
This is, uh, more personal to them.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.480
So it starts, "I'm a faceless person,
forgotten and unknown,

02:37.560 --> 02:39.760
frightened that mistakes I've made
define me."

02:39.840 --> 02:41.320
Read that first line again.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.560
"I'm a faceless person,
forgotten and unknown."

02:48.080 --> 02:49.200
Yeah, that's nice.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.200
How about this?

03:03.640 --> 03:04.480
Blimey.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.440
That kind of Elton feel to it, I think.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.880
Or…

03:23.720 --> 03:26.880
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo. Britain has got talent.
Give me that again.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
Yeah.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.400
-Yeah! See, that's nice.
-Mmm! Mmm!

03:41.480 --> 03:42.800
-What you did before…
-Mm-hmm.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.760
…don't do it again.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.760
-Okay.
-From the top.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.320
It's not everyone's cup of tea,
coming into a place like this,

03:49.400 --> 03:52.000
'cause you've got a lot
of different personalities to manage.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.200
And some of those personalities
have killed people.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.000
The Kardashian story
is very much my story.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.240
There's a little bit of all of them in me.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.920
"I'm excited."

04:01.000 --> 04:02.600
"I'm excited."

04:02.680 --> 04:04.160
"I'm excited."

04:04.240 --> 04:05.800
"I'm excited."

04:05.880 --> 04:07.600
"I'm excited."

04:08.760 --> 04:12.080
So I think you'll agree
it's a very exciting prospect.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.440
Noted.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.880
-"I'm excited!"
-"I'm excited."

04:22.959 --> 04:24.920
-"I'm excited!"
-"I'm excited!"

04:25.480 --> 04:28.840
And that is how we agreed that
the Kardashian medley was an integral part

04:28.920 --> 04:31.240
of this devised piece of prison theater.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.920
I've never felt so fucking at peace.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.600
This whole experience
is a game changer for me.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.040
I mean,
I'm used to being a solitary performer,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.520
and now I find myself
the linchpin of an ensemble.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.000
And it is proper fucking
artistic stuff too.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.920
This is it for me now.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.720
Head down, do my time, get out.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.240
There's a new world
waiting for me out there,

05:08.320 --> 05:11.520
and it is called "the theater."

05:12.720 --> 05:17.320
This is fucking great!

05:17.400 --> 05:18.720
Jesus Christ.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.000
Fucking killing me!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.240
Fuck!

05:28.640 --> 05:30.280
Did you just spread yogurt on your head?

05:30.360 --> 05:33.960
It is hair mist.
Just another way to scent.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.800
-It smells strong.
-Thank you.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.000
-Is it for Ioan?
-What's "Yo-an"?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.520
The Welsh guard whom whose photo
you've been looking at all morning.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.240
-"Eye-oh-an."
-"Yo-an."

05:43.840 --> 05:45.400
-Spell it?
-I-O-A-N.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.560
"Eye-oh-an."

05:46.640 --> 05:48.720
-"Yo-an."
-"Yo-an"?

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
Are you part Welsh?

05:51.160 --> 05:54.040
-You making up your own hours now?
-I was having my scan.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.520
Oh! Did they give you that
little picture that looks like an alien?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.840
I didn't bother keeping it.
I've got no one to show it to.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.560
Did they tell you what you're having?

06:01.640 --> 06:03.840
Don't need to.
I can tell it's a girl. Poor cow.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.880
-What is that smell?
-It's hair mist.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.920
Oh, didn't you know?
It's just another way to scent.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.320
Is he a bit of a knob?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.440
Oh, yes. I thought you knew.
He's a massive knob.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.720
Definitely this time.
My mammy's coming to visit!

06:29.760 --> 06:32.480
Can't wait. I've not seen her
since, like, I've been in here.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.480
'Cause we've both been, you know,
really busy.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.800
Plus, it just breaks her heart
to see me in here,

06:36.880 --> 06:39.160
so it's no wonder
she's not come before now.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.200
We've got so much lost time to make up.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.040
That's why we're gonna cane it
on this road trip.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.320
Road trip!

06:46.400 --> 06:47.480
Yeah!

06:48.280 --> 06:50.840
-You better fucking have got that.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.680
I mean, that's just, like, fucking…

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
That's like--

06:53.840 --> 06:56.120
That's <i>White Men Can't Jump</i> shit, that is.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.040
You fucking-- You didn't get it?
Are you fucking joking?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.280
Go on, girl.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.480
Get in.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.200
Yes!

07:08.680 --> 07:10.960
-Right there, did you get it?
-Wow.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.600
Did you get that?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.200
They didn't fucking get it!

07:14.280 --> 07:16.280
-Aw!
-Are you-- Are you joking with me?

07:16.360 --> 07:18.680
Again? Do you know how hard that is?

07:21.120 --> 07:22.960
<i>Things are getting worse with Anastasia.</i>

07:23.040 --> 07:25.000
Please, Anastasia,
I'm gonna have to get a guard.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.840
No, you're not,
because snitches get stitches.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.080
What have I ever done to you?

07:32.240 --> 07:34.920
But with my newfound prison confidence,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.480
I spoke to Vicki, who spoke to Laura,

07:37.560 --> 07:40.520
who moved me back here with Fat Pat,
where I belong.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
Heaven.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.080
Don't patronize me
because you think I'm blind.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.440
All right, then.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.640
Oh!

07:54.720 --> 07:56.000
Serves her right.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.200
-I've got a new business.
-What's your new business?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.480
-Robbing herbs.
-How's business?

08:00.560 --> 08:02.320
It'll take thyme,
but we're gonna make a mint.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.240
I don't get it.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.760
"Thyme" with a Y, boo.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.400
I've got a new business.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.080
-Oh, God.
-What's your new business?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.920
-Selling spices.
-How's business?

08:12.000 --> 08:12.880
Oregano.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.040
-No, that doesn't work.
-Come on, boo. Focus.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.480
Go on, Sal.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.960
It's kinder to look away.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.920
-That didn't go in, did it?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.840
-Not in the hoop, boo, no.
-I'll get it.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.760
Having a nice time with your new cellmate,
you little snitch?

08:28.840 --> 08:31.920
Yes, thank you.
I'm having a really nice time.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.520
And it means I don't have to tolerate
any more of your nonsense,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.520
you nasty streak of piss.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.799
-Yes, Ange!

08:40.640 --> 08:41.640
Yeah!

08:43.600 --> 08:45.400
Charlee spudded me.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.799
Like that.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.240
I just went with it.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.000
Come on, Flange!

08:52.080 --> 08:53.280
Coming!

08:59.240 --> 09:01.720
You got this? Inmates' art.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.120
Not bad, is it?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.480
I mean, it's not bad.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.720
And then some of them…

09:08.880 --> 09:10.040
Cutting out shapes.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.840
Cutting out shapes.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.920
It's a mixed bag, innit?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.240
"Pat Pat."

09:21.320 --> 09:23.240
Now she's gotta be 40-odd.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.360
And this…

09:25.360 --> 09:27.000
Oh, here's what we'll do.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.880
I'll draw this.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.440
I'm thinking, "Oh, do you know
what would make it look better?"

09:33.360 --> 09:34.960
If I shade it in more.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.840
So I'll do it again.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.520
What I won't do is shade that one in more.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.920
I mean, what is it?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.480
Viv, can I have a quick word?

10:09.560 --> 10:12.480
Just a moment. Let me shake off Kourtney.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
Go on.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.760
It's hard for me to say this,
but I feel you have a right to know.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.720
Look, I think you're incredibly talented,

10:18.800 --> 10:21.080
which is why I'm so angry right now
with what's going on.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.480
Right.

10:22.560 --> 10:26.120
I've tried to keep it from you.
Oh, maybe I just shouldn't say anything.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
Okay.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.160
Ange is telling everyone that
all your Kardashians sound the same.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.240
I see.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
"Mammy."

10:46.560 --> 10:48.440
I don't suppose you got any Toffifee.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.560
No, that's Fi. I'm Sal.
But, no, we don't have any toffee.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.400
No, Toffifee.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.960
That's right, no toffee.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.200
But again, I'm Sal, and that's Fi.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.200
Yeah, I know, Sal.
I'm not asking for toffee.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.000
Good, because we haven't got any.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.200
I'm asking about
those things you get at Christmas.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.480
You know, caramel cup
with a chocolate button on top.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.680
-You mean "To-fee-fee"?
-No, I mean "Toffee-fee."

11:10.760 --> 11:13.640
-Okay, let's leave it.
-Do you mean "To-fa-fee"?

11:13.720 --> 11:15.760
You call Toffifee, "To-fa-fee," Fi?

11:15.840 --> 11:17.480
What's a "fa-fee-fee"? It's "To-fa-fee."

11:18.120 --> 11:20.360
I don't know.
To-fee-fee. To-fa-fee. To-foo-foo.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.680
Bloody minefield this is, isn't it?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.960
Call it what you like!
I don't want any trouble!

11:25.680 --> 11:28.160
Sorry. Sorry.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.360
<i>Sometimes I forget I'm in a safe place.</i>

11:35.960 --> 11:37.640
He can't get me here.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.520
But the triggers are still there.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.000
The last time I mispronounced something,
I ended up with three stitches in my head.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.920
That's the beauty of prison, though.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.320
The freedom.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.240
To-fee-fee!

11:57.440 --> 11:59.360
<i>Sal is one of the few people</i>

11:59.440 --> 12:02.560
<i>whose life genuinely improved</i>
<i>when she got here.</i>

12:02.640 --> 12:06.080
From day one, her relief was palpable.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.200
All she wanted was to start again.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.440
And when Cal arrived, she got her wish.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.560
<i>They like being together so much,</i>

12:12.640 --> 12:15.520
they deliberately nixed
their parole hearings

12:15.600 --> 12:16.920
to extend their stay.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.200
<i>They have been very creative</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

12:19.280 --> 12:21.160
Come on, ladies.
You know this isn't the answer.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.440
Shut it, screw!

12:23.040 --> 12:24.320
So sorry, Gary!

12:24.400 --> 12:26.920
<i>I know I look like a soft touch</i>
<i>for allowing it,</i>

12:27.000 --> 12:28.320
<i>but they're not hurting anyone,</i>

12:28.400 --> 12:29.720
apart from Gary.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.880
Why shouldn't they have
a bit of happiness?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.560
Plus, he can be quite annoying.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.680
It's all our families, look!

12:57.440 --> 12:58.520
Get the fuck--

12:58.600 --> 13:01.240
-Mammy!
-You look like shite.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.800
Oh!

13:02.880 --> 13:04.880
I can't-- I can't believe you're here.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.040
Oh!

13:06.120 --> 13:09.520
I-I know-- I know it sounds mad,
but I-I thought you were never gonna come.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.840
I got you some of your favorites.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.240
I don't like Doritos.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.200
Oh. Those are for me.

13:15.280 --> 13:19.760
Took me ages getting through the security.
Place is a joke, wasting my time.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.960
-Is that Willis woman still the governor?
-Laura. Yeah.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.400
Yeah, she's the one who's making
the "Songs From the Inside" thing happen.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.920
Yeah, as governors go, she's all right.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.320
She's a fucking waste of space.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.200
Fucking waste of space
and I don't like her.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.400
Oh! It's so good to see you!

13:35.480 --> 13:36.680
Well, I can't stay long.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.720
I've got to go and see a man
about the camper van.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.920
You what?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.480
-You've already found us a camper van?
-Gotta pay for it by the end of the week.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.880
Otherwise, we lose the fucker.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.800
-How much is it?
-How much is in the joint account?

13:48.880 --> 13:50.600
9,700.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.640
This is 9,705.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.880
Are you-- Shit! Are you fucking joking?

13:56.960 --> 14:00.160
That's so close! What are we gonna do?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.160
-It's all right. I can make up the extra.
-For real?

14:03.960 --> 14:05.480
Fucking great!

14:05.560 --> 14:09.480
So you need to transfer all the cash over
from that stupid bastard Sebastian to me.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.160
Wait, Mammy.
I have a whole month left in here.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.880
Why don't we keep Sebastian on the hook?
Get him paying into the account still?

14:16.960 --> 14:19.480
Then when I get out,
we got loads more money to spend!

14:19.560 --> 14:21.640
Because I have to pay for it
by the end of the week.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.480
Why don't you listen,
you half-wit mongrel?

14:23.560 --> 14:26.040
Now get the money transferred
so I can pay the man,

14:26.120 --> 14:29.240
and we can go on the road trip
of a lifetime in a fucking camper van.

14:34.040 --> 14:39.080
I just want everything to be nice
when you come out.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.080
I'll get those little air fresheners
in the shape of a tree.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.080
Yeah. Stickers that say,
"You just got passed by a girl."

14:47.160 --> 14:48.920
Fun stuff like that.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.240
I want to be here,
waiting to pick you up in it

14:52.320 --> 14:54.640
when you walk through that door.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.840
That's all I want.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.840
Oh. Mammy…

14:58.920 --> 15:00.720
So you'll transfer the money, will you?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.040
So there's one less thing
for me to worry about?

15:03.120 --> 15:04.160
Of course!

15:04.240 --> 15:07.760
Great! Gotta bounce. See youse in a month.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.200
Wait, I'll see you in two weeks
for the show.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.240
-What?
-I got you a front-row seat.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.320
-See you!
-See youse!

15:31.440 --> 15:34.600
You gotta duck and dive, babe.
You gotta-- Boom! Don't you?

15:34.680 --> 15:37.800
You gotta-- Oh, got you there, didn't I?
Nearly got you there. Come on. Come on.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.160
Ducking and diving.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.040
Fuck!

15:52.800 --> 15:54.120
Teaching 'em well.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.320
Teaching 'em well.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.120
OMG, you guys!

16:22.200 --> 16:23.360
Too cute.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.520
We should livestream this. Yay!

16:26.600 --> 16:29.160
This is a TikTok in the making,
'cause all that…

16:30.640 --> 16:31.840
People love that, don't they?

16:33.280 --> 16:34.960
Oh, I forgot to say. Ioan's here.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.000
Mmm!

16:40.080 --> 16:42.120
That hair mist is still holding up.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.240
Hey. Mind your business.
It's just another way to scent.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.840
Here we go. Come on, then.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.800
It's-- It's easy!

16:53.880 --> 16:57.000
He checks one. He checks two.
He checks three.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.200
Oh!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.440
Oh!

17:01.760 --> 17:04.160
-Come on.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.920
Hello, everyone.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.960
<i>Bore da</i> , Sian.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.640
That just means hello.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.400
<i>Bore da</i> , Yoon.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.880
I-yoon.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.560
I-yoon. Yoo-yoon.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.720
-Ah-yoon.
-Ioan.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.839
Can I call you Ian?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.040
-Yeah.
-<i>Diolch</i> .

17:25.119 --> 17:29.319
Okay. Here we are,
together at last.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.119
I am immensely proud
of the diversity in this prison.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.720
Obviously, I can't take any credit.
That's just a happy coincidence.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.200
But if it were up to me,

17:38.280 --> 17:42.720
I would pack this place to the rafters
with all sorts of minorities.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.960
The more the merrier.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.360
Because, in my book,

17:45.440 --> 17:48.480
our differences are what make us the same.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.040
I don't actually have a book,
but I do have a TED Talk coming up.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.960
It's called,
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

17:56.040 --> 17:58.800
But I can tell you all
about that later, Ian.

17:58.880 --> 18:04.120
We are here because
I want to understand your Welshness, Sian.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.400
These are Welsh.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.680
Welsh cakes.

18:07.320 --> 18:12.200
And it is this area of Welshness
that I'm most interested in.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.920
I know how uprooted you feel
about being here, I think.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.120
How every day challenges
your sense of Celtic pride and self,

18:22.200 --> 18:23.440
I'm guessing.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.040
I see it, I feel it, and it hurts.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.640
That's why Ian's here.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.720
To make sense of your pain/accent.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.080
Over to you, Sian.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.560
Oh, well…

18:37.640 --> 18:39.480
Yeah, so, uh…

18:42.080 --> 18:43.320
…my kids to come see it.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.920
Uh, what else? Oh, I know.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.280
Well, don't--
don't sugarcoat it for me, Ian.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.640
How bad is it?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.080
First of all, can I just tell you…

19:05.120 --> 19:06.840
…great idea. Probably yours, right?

19:09.560 --> 19:11.320
Do it again and lead me in.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.600
-See, missed it already.
-Didn't know you were gonna start then.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.440
-No.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.360
-Too soon.
-No. That was "no" as in, "I'm not ready."

19:20.440 --> 19:22.000
Why did you sing it then?

19:24.160 --> 19:26.600
-I was pointing for ages then.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.640
-Yes!

19:29.720 --> 19:31.360
Yes? I thought it was no.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.840
-No, I was just saying--
-Oh, just forget it. Forget it.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.640
It's stupid.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.560
Oh, she did mention a…

19:45.880 --> 19:47.400
Legend!

19:49.960 --> 19:54.320
Right. Well, that has cleared up
a lot of things.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
Thank you.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.400
I mean, these are just flat scones,
aren't they?

20:04.360 --> 20:05.520
Quite dry.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.600
Three weeks in
and this is where we find ourselves.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.080
They've made all this up.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.120
As far as I can gather, the main themes
are women, prison and violence,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.640
so no one's strayed too far out
of their comfort zone.

20:24.720 --> 20:29.000
But it has been set to a banging tune,
and the finale's a big ol' knife fight.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.520
I mean, fair play to them.
They've jumped right in.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.000
I wouldn't have had Pat Pat down
as a street dancer,

20:34.080 --> 20:36.040
but she is surprisingly light on her feet.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.520
All right, Big Viv.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.360
Don't worry about this massive grin
on my chops. My solicitor's just told me--

21:00.920 --> 21:01.960
Ooh!

21:02.040 --> 21:04.040
-Bloody hell!

21:04.120 --> 21:05.640
Sorry about that.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.480
It's just something that had to be done.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.320
-What did I do? What did I do?
-Ange, please, try to calm some.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.520
To be fair, I am late for my break.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.760
Thank you so much, Ioan.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.240
Yoan-- Yo-- The rest of it.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.080
My pleasure, Laura, my absolute pleasure.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.560
Look,
I know it's not strictly professional

21:27.640 --> 21:29.120
but I feel this great connection
between us.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.640
I'm down here a couple of days
and I'd really like to see you again.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.640
I mean I'd really like to see you again.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.200
Uh…

21:35.280 --> 21:36.720
Ain't that the truth?

21:37.920 --> 21:38.880
Oh, that will be for me.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.480
Oh yeah, yeah, off you go.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.320
Saved by the bloody bell.
What's the point? What's the point?

21:45.800 --> 21:46.880
She's cracking isn't she?

21:46.960 --> 21:49.720
And I know it sounds silly,
but her hair smells lovely.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.200
All right, gay boy.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.000
Not gay, boo. Just from Essex.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.640
-Yeah, right.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.880
Yeah, you wish.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.600
Pretty dramatic day all around.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
Not really.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.040
<i>Ange is going to be fine.</i>

22:23.120 --> 22:26.120
<i>It wasn't a broken nose,</i>
<i>just a perforated septum,</i>

22:26.200 --> 22:30.000
so no long-term
breathing difficulties, probably.

22:30.080 --> 22:35.600
Big Viv is back in solitary and has
requested access to the Sky Arts channel.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.680
Request denied.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.720
Fucking excited now, are ya?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.080
Shame about Ian.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.080
I thought there was a spark,
but couldn't understand a word he said.

22:46.040 --> 22:51.960
<i>As for Sian's request, prison regulations</i>
<i>forbid live nocturnal animals.</i>

22:52.520 --> 22:54.120
<i>I made an exception for the stout.</i>

22:54.200 --> 22:55.280
For you.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
For you.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
For you.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.600
And your Toffifee.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.680
Oh, Toffifee!

23:06.760 --> 23:10.240
Just have to keep plugging away
and hope my ear adjusts.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.800
Onwards.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.160
Still, Charlee gave me this.

23:16.240 --> 23:20.160
And our TikTok has been viewed
by upwards of 156 people.

23:20.240 --> 23:25.400
We're practically trending,
so pretty good day all around.
