Nah. He just sent this raven

Nope! With Remy gone,

07:18.612 --> 07:20.875
we can finally do
whatever we want.

Nice work, everyone!
We did it!

07:48.424 --> 07:50.121
- Meow what?
- I don't know.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.906
We did everything
we wanted to do.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.603
Oh! Remy's got
a bunch of notes back here.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.083
Maybe he's got
another adventure.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.867
Wow, he's got tons of ideas!

07:56.911 --> 07:58.565

08:05.310 --> 08:07.530
Gee, he really worked hard
on all this.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.533
Yeah. This got boring
real fast without Remy.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.492

No, it's just the guilt.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.148

- Wait!

I know what we have to do.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.978
We're goin' on
one more adventure...

08:21.022 --> 08:22.980
To get our Maze Master back!

08:23.024 --> 08:24.329
The Remy way!

08:26.244 --> 08:28.159
A staircase leading
to the unknown.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.510
I roll to see
how many steps I can take.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.946
All right, fifteen!

08:31.989 --> 08:33.121
Schmalfo's turn.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.036
Seventeen! Meow! Meow!

08:35.079 --> 08:36.516
Come on, Bufflegs!

08:36.559 --> 08:38.082
One?! Urgh!

08:38.126 --> 08:39.344
One. Urgh!

08:39.388 --> 08:40.911
One. Hmph!

08:40.955 --> 08:42.652
One. One. One!

08:42.696 --> 08:44.480
- Gah! What is it?
- Eighteen.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.875
Oh, <i>now</i> I get the eighteen!
Urgh, let's go.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.964
A dark hallway
of doors and treasures.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.053
It's hard to see down there.
Diamondbow!

08:52.096 --> 08:53.620
Right!
[makes zooming noise]

08:53.663 --> 08:56.057
The Maze Master's lair
is right up ahead!

08:56.100 --> 08:57.449
Now, let's roll!

08:57.493 --> 09:01.584
[effort grunts]

09:01.628 --> 09:02.977
[all gasp]

09:03.020 --> 09:05.196
Master Remy said no visitors.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.112
Oh, yeah? Then, I guess
we'll just have to roll for...

09:08.156 --> 09:11.115
- Persuasion!
- Hah!

09:11.159 --> 09:15.598
Three perfect twenties?!
I. Am. Defeated!

09:15.642 --> 09:19.123
[moaning]
[slurps, smacks lips]

09:19.167 --> 09:21.343
- [Cricket] Maze Master!
- Cricket?

09:21.386 --> 09:24.128
We are here to
return you to your throne!

09:24.172 --> 09:26.740
Aah! Wh-wh-wha?!

09:26.783 --> 09:29.220
The maze is no fun
without your expert guidance.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.005
Also, we miss you.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.007
I thought you didn't wanna
play my way.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.531
We played your way all the way
here and it was awesome!

09:35.575 --> 09:37.141
Except for when
I kept rolling ones.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.144
But the challenge is what made
the victory so much more sweet!

09:40.188 --> 09:42.146
Look, Remy,
while the game does need

09:42.190 --> 09:44.975
your well thought-out world
and weirdly specific rules,

09:45.019 --> 09:48.022
it also needs to be flexible
for the players to have fun.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.154
The game needs everybody
to work.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.026
We all control the story,
together.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.028
Huh. I guess I never considered

09:54.071 --> 09:56.204
how strict of a Maze Master
I was being.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.989
Whaddaya say
we finish up that maze?

09:59.033 --> 10:01.165
I'm in!

10:01.209 --> 10:04.212
Now, let's show that dragon
who's boss, together!

10:05.692 --> 10:08.172
So, puny mortals!
You cannot fight me

10:08.216 --> 10:09.957
until you answer my riddle.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.961
What do you call cheese
that isn't yours?

10:14.004 --> 10:16.224
[all]
Nacho cheese!

10:16.267 --> 10:18.443
Urgh! You figured it out!

10:18.487 --> 10:21.011
Now, let's finish this,
once and for all!

10:21.055 --> 10:23.013
- Huh?
- Here comes Schmalfo!

10:23.057 --> 10:24.798
- Hachahachahacha!
- Aah!

10:24.841 --> 10:26.800
- Hyah!
- [clangs]

10:26.843 --> 10:28.802
- [crashing]
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

10:28.845 --> 10:31.195
Your attacks have weakened me,

10:31.239 --> 10:34.938
leaving my shins
completely exposed.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.418
[gasps] Remy!

10:36.461 --> 10:38.768
Shin kick!

10:38.812 --> 10:40.683
Aah!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.511
[Remy] <i>You obtain the emerald!</i>

10:42.554 --> 10:44.992
<i>What will you do with
such a magnificent treasure?</i>

10:45.035 --> 10:46.515
I'ma smash it.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.691
Smash it? But the rules say...

10:48.735 --> 10:50.606
Well, actually,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.130
Bufflegs,
Diamondbow and Schmalfo

10:53.174 --> 10:54.741
decide to break the emerald,

10:54.784 --> 10:57.308
<i>but know not
the risk of doing so...</i>

10:57.352 --> 10:59.136
[Cricket, Tilly, Kiki] <i>Ooh!</i>

10:59.180 --> 11:01.835
Schmalfo, Schmalfo!
That's the end!
