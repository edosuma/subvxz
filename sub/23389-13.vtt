00:02.505 --> 00:04.424
Previously on "The Path"...

00:04.424 --> 00:07.263
We need to purge this movement
of darkness, of Steve.

00:07.263 --> 00:09.852
‐ How?
‐ We tell everyone.

00:09.852 --> 00:11.689
‐ The end is gonna be in Bali.

00:11.689 --> 00:13.943
‐ Who told you about Bali?
‐ I saw it.

00:13.943 --> 00:16.658
‐ What if you came
to work for me?

00:16.658 --> 00:18.410
I want you on the team
when I run for Governor.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.081
‐ I'm getting you out of here.
Come on.

00:20.081 --> 00:21.458
‐ Look, I‐I can't.

00:21.458 --> 00:22.795
‐ What is wrong with you?
‐ Don't‐‐

00:25.049 --> 00:27.721
‐ We have to cut off ties
and end the trip to Bali.

00:27.721 --> 00:30.309
‐ You won't get better
unless you leave this place.

00:30.309 --> 00:33.107
If you don't get better,
I can't love you.

00:33.107 --> 00:37.448
‐ Eddie, I believe in you.
I believe in this movement.

00:37.448 --> 00:38.827
I would destroy everything

00:38.827 --> 00:41.248
I worked so fucking hard
to put behind me!

00:41.248 --> 00:43.503
‐ Steve needs to be
written out of Revelation.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.256
‐ The Movement won't survive.

00:45.256 --> 00:47.636
‐ They are not here for Steve.
They are here for me.

00:47.636 --> 00:50.474
‐ No, I can't let you do that.
I won't let you do that.

01:38.571 --> 01:41.911
‐ I have lived without you,
Light, for so long,

01:41.911 --> 01:44.750
without your love,
without your warmth,

01:44.750 --> 01:47.255
but I beg you now‐‐

01:47.255 --> 01:50.469
come back to me.

01:50.469 --> 01:52.599
Come back to me.

01:54.227 --> 01:57.233
‐ Give me strength.

01:57.233 --> 02:00.489
Give me conviction.

02:00.489 --> 02:04.164
‐ Light that was
taken from me...

02:06.752 --> 02:09.508
Or left me to suffer alone...

02:11.344 --> 02:13.390
‐ That has given me hope...

02:16.773 --> 02:18.568
And reason.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.542
‐ Come back to me now.

02:26.542 --> 02:28.922
Come back to me.

02:57.646 --> 03:00.610
‐ Let me do right by you now.

03:13.511 --> 03:15.139
‐ Thank you for everything.

03:15.139 --> 03:17.561
‐ We've been preparing
for so long.

03:17.561 --> 03:19.982
‐ I can't believe
it's finally almost here.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.484
‐ Well, you've done amazing.

03:21.484 --> 03:23.405
Are you going to Bali with him?

03:23.405 --> 03:25.911
I'd come just to‐‐
‐ Bali is no longer happening.

03:28.206 --> 03:29.793
Yeah, um...

03:29.793 --> 03:31.296
we're no longer gonna
open a center there.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.300
The trip has been canceled.

03:35.597 --> 03:39.647
‐ Did I just hear you say that
Eddie won't be going to Bali?

03:39.647 --> 03:41.817
But isn't that where your
mother had the vision?

03:41.817 --> 03:43.571
I thought that that's
why we were here,

03:43.571 --> 03:47.119
to celebrate and plan.

03:47.119 --> 03:49.875
We just heard that
Bali isn't happening?

03:57.849 --> 04:01.147
‐ The Movement's
upcoming trip...

04:01.147 --> 04:05.239
has been temporarily...
canceled.

04:05.239 --> 04:07.911
‐ But that's where
you saw it happen.

04:07.911 --> 04:09.455
Tell us what this means.

04:09.455 --> 04:11.627
Does this mean
we have to keep waiting?

04:11.627 --> 04:13.673
You said it would
happen in our lifetime.

04:13.673 --> 04:16.971
‐ We're the ones
to build the new world.

04:24.987 --> 04:26.406
‐ Lilith...

04:26.406 --> 04:29.705
assure them,
as you always assure me.

04:33.796 --> 04:36.384
‐ The Movement will grow.

04:36.384 --> 04:38.055
The son will die.

04:38.055 --> 04:40.977
And the cleanse...

04:40.977 --> 04:43.273
the cleanse will come.

04:59.765 --> 05:02.269
‐ How is he?
‐ He misses you.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.190
‐ I put his Sophie
in here, diapers.

05:04.190 --> 05:05.527
He ate about an hour ago,

05:05.527 --> 05:06.946
so he should be good
till 11:00.

05:06.946 --> 05:08.616
‐ Hey!

05:10.494 --> 05:12.791
You got something
at the compound tonight?

05:12.791 --> 05:14.335
‐ Revelation.

05:14.335 --> 05:16.381
‐ What's that?
Uh, actually, you know what?

05:16.381 --> 05:18.051
Uh, don't tell me.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.013
Um, just put him in day care
when you have to go,

05:20.013 --> 05:21.391
and I'll pick him up
after work.

05:21.391 --> 05:22.811
‐ Okay. How's the job?

05:22.811 --> 05:24.523
‐ Good.
‐ Good.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.819
‐ How are you?

05:26.819 --> 05:29.240
‐ Hanging in.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.202
‐ You know I didn't
want to leave you, but...

05:31.202 --> 05:32.914
‐ No‐‐
‐ I‐I can't just keep going...

05:32.914 --> 05:34.417
‐ No, no, no, no‐‐
‐ And going and never getting‐‐

05:34.417 --> 05:36.714
‐ No, I‐I get it.
I‐I get it. I know.

05:36.714 --> 05:38.008
I know.

05:40.345 --> 05:42.934
Hey, look, c‐come on
the merry‐go‐round with us.

05:42.934 --> 05:44.813
‐ I'm late for work.
‐ Come on. Just one ride.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.065
It'll be fun.

05:46.065 --> 05:47.611
‐ Fun?
‐ Yeah.

05:47.611 --> 05:50.282
‐ Nothing in my life
is fun right now.

05:50.282 --> 05:52.787
I live in a Holiday Inn.
My heart is broken.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.958
And I actually like my job,
and I'm going to be late,

05:54.958 --> 05:56.419
and I‐‐

05:57.714 --> 06:00.845
I don't want to get
reeled back into you.

06:00.845 --> 06:02.849
‐ I promise, you won't.

06:05.563 --> 06:07.399
I want you to be happy, Mary.

06:07.399 --> 06:09.947
I really‐‐I really do.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.879
Look, come on.

06:17.879 --> 06:19.591
Come on, come on, come on.

06:22.806 --> 06:24.183
Hello, sir.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.522
Uh, three‐‐
three tickets, please.

06:26.522 --> 06:27.691
Thank you.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.193
Here, oh, let me take your bag.

06:29.193 --> 06:30.780
Oh, my God,
this thing weighs a ton.

06:30.780 --> 06:31.949
Come on, come on.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.211
Okay.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.634
Look, look, look, look.

07:25.097 --> 07:27.644
Yeah.

07:37.371 --> 07:40.335
‐ I'm going to tell
the membership at Revelation...

07:40.335 --> 07:41.755
everything.

07:41.755 --> 07:43.759
‐ People will have
a lot of questions.

07:43.759 --> 07:47.224
You're the only one who can say
what happened on Huayna Picchu,

07:47.224 --> 07:50.021
whether Steve saw a Ladder...

07:50.021 --> 07:51.733
or not.

07:51.733 --> 07:54.321
‐ Are you kidding me?

07:54.321 --> 07:57.452
This is bullshit.
This is utter and total crap.

07:57.452 --> 07:58.914
‐ It's not, Mom.

07:58.914 --> 08:00.751
‐ Steve was one
of my closest friends.

08:00.751 --> 08:02.589
More than a friend‐‐
he was family.

08:02.589 --> 08:04.383
‐ You know, I didn't want it
to be true either.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.012
‐ I'm going.
Let's go, let's go.

08:06.012 --> 08:08.016
‐ Who have you become?

08:08.016 --> 08:10.353
This is why you
put me in France...

08:10.353 --> 08:11.940
‐ No, Felicia.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.736
‐ So you could put together
this story.

08:13.736 --> 08:16.199
‐ This isn't a story.

08:16.199 --> 08:19.205
‐ I saw him climb The Ladder.

08:19.205 --> 08:21.125
I tried to climb after.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.589
‐ Yeah, that's what
you've told us.

08:23.589 --> 08:27.722
‐ I will not let you be abused
like this, Felicia. Let's go.

08:27.722 --> 08:30.227
‐ I know what happened,

08:30.227 --> 08:31.855
and I'm the only one left

08:31.855 --> 08:34.861
who can defend
against these lies,

08:34.861 --> 08:36.865
and I will do that.

08:36.865 --> 08:40.455
‐ Your word is the only one
that doesn't fit.

08:40.455 --> 08:42.751
‐ This is for you.

08:42.751 --> 08:44.756
This is self‐serving.
‐ I started this.

08:44.756 --> 08:47.261
I found Lilith. I discovered
The Hypoxian Cleanse‐‐

08:47.261 --> 08:50.893
‐ And that. Allegations
that Steve abused Cal?

08:50.893 --> 08:52.981
Steve was the only father
that boy ever had.

08:52.981 --> 08:55.151
‐ No, we are not naming names.

08:55.151 --> 08:56.738
‐ I just hope he's in on this,

08:56.738 --> 08:58.742
because if you're using him
for your smear‐‐

08:58.742 --> 09:00.287
‐ You know what?
That's enough.

09:00.287 --> 09:02.667
This is painful for all of us.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.128
It's why I couldn't see
Summer in the play.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.798
It is why I left The Movement.

09:05.798 --> 09:08.303
And none of us wants
to believe that this is true,

09:08.303 --> 09:09.681
but it is,

09:09.681 --> 09:11.602
and the sooner
that we accept it,

09:11.602 --> 09:13.479
we can move forward
as a community.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.066
‐ The community
will see through this.

09:15.066 --> 09:17.905
‐ Look, I promised...

09:17.905 --> 09:20.995
a Ladder to Enlightenment
that is illuminated...

09:20.995 --> 09:22.790
‐ Let's go.
‐ By Transparency.

09:22.790 --> 09:25.378
And that is what
I intend to give.

09:25.378 --> 09:27.675
‐ This will backfire.

09:27.675 --> 09:29.721
You'll lose everyone.

09:37.486 --> 09:39.239
‐ All right...

09:39.239 --> 09:41.035
buses are gonna
be here at 4:00

09:41.035 --> 09:43.414
to pick us up,
take us to the compound.

09:43.414 --> 09:45.085
‐ What's this
Revelation thing about?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.214
‐ I am as in the dark
as you guys.

09:47.214 --> 09:49.844
All I know is my dad said
it's important.

09:49.844 --> 09:51.180
He wants us all to be there,

09:51.180 --> 09:52.725
and he's gonna
tell us something.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.311
‐ Uh, I have plans tonight.
‐ Cancel them.

09:54.311 --> 09:56.440
‐ It's probably
about the rumors.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.154
‐ Everybody saw Cal
in that TV show. He killed it.

09:59.154 --> 10:01.200
‐ That doesn't mean that people
don't believe that article.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.578
‐ Do you think
we're shutting down?

10:02.578 --> 10:03.956
‐ Of course not.

10:03.956 --> 10:05.668
‐ Because I heard
Eddie disappeared again.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.254
‐ Okay, guys, here's the deal‐‐

10:07.254 --> 10:09.592
my dad is The Guardian
of The Light.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.972
He says to be somewhere, we go.

10:11.972 --> 10:13.224
Unless any of you happen to

10:13.224 --> 10:15.061
commune directly
with The Light?

10:15.061 --> 10:17.065
Jeremy?

10:17.065 --> 10:18.902
Cassie?

10:18.902 --> 10:21.115
You guys need...

10:21.115 --> 10:24.539
Revelation
more than anybody else.

10:24.539 --> 10:26.041
If you guys
aren't there tonight,

10:26.041 --> 10:28.087
don't bother coming
back here tomorrow.

10:30.509 --> 10:32.764
See you on the bus.

10:38.399 --> 10:40.780
‐ Yes? Who is it?

10:42.240 --> 10:44.077
‐ Hey.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.792
Uh, you got a minute?

10:46.792 --> 10:48.587
‐ Not really.

10:51.425 --> 10:53.346
So, um...

10:53.346 --> 10:58.064
Gede, he decided to pull
out of setting us up in Bali.

10:58.064 --> 11:00.903
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

11:00.903 --> 11:02.197
‐ I killed it.

11:02.197 --> 11:04.243
‐ Why?

11:04.243 --> 11:05.621
Because of your mother?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.583
‐ Eddie, I'm really mad at you,

11:07.583 --> 11:09.378
but I also don't want you dead.

11:10.798 --> 11:12.384
You still believe in her.

11:15.014 --> 11:17.018
‐ I don't know
what I believe in,

11:17.018 --> 11:21.026
but I just know that I didn't
want to take any chances.

11:21.026 --> 11:23.072
‐ Um...

11:23.072 --> 11:26.120
look, Vera, I'm...

11:26.120 --> 11:27.999
I'm sorry...

11:27.999 --> 11:30.169
about what happened with us.

11:30.169 --> 11:31.590
‐ Yeah.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.677
Me‐‐me too.

11:33.677 --> 11:36.223
‐ Are you still a Meyerist?

11:36.223 --> 11:39.146
‐ I'm thankful
to The Meyerist Movement

11:39.146 --> 11:42.778
for helping me get
out of a very dangerous cult

11:42.778 --> 11:44.824
that is my mother.

11:47.914 --> 11:50.711
‐ Why don't you come back

11:50.711 --> 11:53.007
to work with us...

11:53.007 --> 11:57.182
as a Meyerist
or as a secular person?

11:57.182 --> 11:59.227
‐ Why would I do that?

12:00.396 --> 12:03.570
‐ Because I am sure
you're trying to figure out

12:03.570 --> 12:06.075
what you are going to do next,

12:06.075 --> 12:08.997
and you liked working with us.

12:08.997 --> 12:12.755
Plus, The Movement
is going to need you.

12:12.755 --> 12:15.844
‐ Why? Why‐‐why would
The Movement need me?

12:15.844 --> 12:17.848
‐ I am planning to reveal

12:17.848 --> 12:20.186
everything that I've learned
about your mother

12:20.186 --> 12:21.690
and Steve‐‐

12:21.690 --> 12:23.234
about who he was,

12:23.234 --> 12:24.904
what he stole,

12:24.904 --> 12:27.409
how he abused,

12:27.409 --> 12:30.498
and then I am going
to start over.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.214
You want my...

12:34.214 --> 12:36.761
last piece
of professional advice?

12:38.472 --> 12:40.268
Don't do it.

12:41.938 --> 12:45.028
Well, it's... going to happen,

12:45.028 --> 12:47.783
tonight at Revelation.

12:47.783 --> 12:50.581
‐ Why can't Revelation
be about acknowledging

12:50.581 --> 12:53.335
how far everyone's come,
optimism and future?

12:53.335 --> 12:55.256
Just let the past
stay in the past.

12:55.256 --> 12:57.887
‐ Because Steve
needs to be purged.

12:57.887 --> 12:59.431
‐ Steve chose you, Eddie.

12:59.431 --> 13:02.103
‐ No, he chose me to erase him.

13:02.103 --> 13:03.607
‐ This is not
going to erase him.

13:03.607 --> 13:05.944
This is all anyone
will ever talk about.

13:05.944 --> 13:07.948
‐ Then why don't you
help me make sure that

13:07.948 --> 13:09.786
that is not the case?

13:09.786 --> 13:12.917
Vera...

13:12.917 --> 13:15.672
help me rebuild.

13:31.453 --> 13:33.082
‐ Thank you
for meeting me here.

13:33.082 --> 13:34.877
‐ Of course. What is it?

13:34.877 --> 13:36.881
And‐‐and why here?

13:36.881 --> 13:39.971
‐ I know you're afraid, Lilith.

13:39.971 --> 13:42.308
‐ I'm not.
‐ You are.

13:42.308 --> 13:44.271
And I wanted to offer myself.

13:44.271 --> 13:46.275
‐ Offer yourself?

13:46.275 --> 13:50.032
‐ When my wife was killed,
there seemed little to live for

13:50.032 --> 13:54.249
but the hope you gave me
of a better world.

13:54.249 --> 13:56.378
‐ You've been so good to me.

13:56.378 --> 13:59.510
Everything I've seen
over the years

13:59.510 --> 14:01.430
has come to be true.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.229
I‐I don't understand
what it means

14:05.229 --> 14:09.029
when someone alters the future
like Vera has.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.741
I‐‐

14:10.741 --> 14:13.037
I don't‐‐I don't know
what happens next.

14:13.037 --> 14:15.166
‐ Maybe it wasn't Bali.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.337
Maybe Bali doesn't matter.

14:17.337 --> 14:20.301
In your vision, could you see
who it was that shot him?

14:20.301 --> 14:22.055
‐ No.

14:22.055 --> 14:23.390
‐ Why not me, then?

14:23.390 --> 14:24.977
‐ Do you even know
how to use a gun?

14:46.395 --> 14:48.065
‐ You aren't the one to do it.

14:50.444 --> 14:52.323
‐ Your cancer's
not getting better.

14:53.994 --> 14:58.210
The last MRI shows it's now
in your liver and lungs.

14:58.210 --> 15:01.551
There are so many ways to
fight it, and we will do that,

15:01.551 --> 15:04.305
but we can't lose you
before the end.

15:04.305 --> 15:06.853
We can't do it without you.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.369
‐
I'm supposed to speak

15:15.369 --> 15:17.290
at this EcoFaith Initiative
tomorrow.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.545
It's a faith‐based
environmental group.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.799
I don't know how those two
things aren't contradictory.

15:21.799 --> 15:23.720
But if we can get
the wackos on board

15:23.720 --> 15:26.517
with some of the science around
climate change, I'm for it.

15:28.103 --> 15:30.901
I'm sorry, did I offend you
with the, uh, "wackos" thing?

15:30.901 --> 15:33.698
‐ No, you didn't.
‐ So I'm boring you. Great.

15:33.698 --> 15:35.076
Can't even keep your attention.

15:35.076 --> 15:36.453
How am I gonna
win over this group

15:36.453 --> 15:38.207
of tree‐hugging Christians

15:38.207 --> 15:39.794
who probably already think
I'm an unrepentant sinner?

15:39.794 --> 15:41.547
‐ You're nothing of the sort.

15:41.547 --> 15:44.260
You're just a flawed human
being like the rest of us,

15:44.260 --> 15:46.348
seeking redemption.

15:46.348 --> 15:48.686
We all are.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.607
‐ Hmm.

15:50.607 --> 15:52.653
You okay?

15:52.653 --> 15:54.782
‐ I don't want to talk
about my personal life.

15:54.782 --> 15:56.493
‐ Okay.

15:56.493 --> 15:58.581
But I didn't ask.

15:58.581 --> 16:01.754
‐ I will help you talk
to the Green Christians.

16:01.754 --> 16:03.298
I'm all over it.

16:03.298 --> 16:06.681
You know, I'm just going
through, um...

16:06.681 --> 16:08.433
My life is, uh, changing‐‐

16:08.433 --> 16:10.522
Fuck. You know what? It is‐‐
it's so stuffy in here.

16:10.522 --> 16:12.191
Could we get some air?

16:12.191 --> 16:13.862
‐ Yeah, sorry, they sealed
those off a while ago.

16:13.862 --> 16:15.657
I think they thought
I was gonna jump.

16:15.657 --> 16:17.034
Or maybe someone from my staff.

16:17.034 --> 16:18.705
Hey, you know what?
I got an idea.

16:18.705 --> 16:19.707
Come with me.

16:19.707 --> 16:21.836
Here, take your coat.

16:25.342 --> 16:26.888
‐ Wow.

16:26.888 --> 16:28.265
‐ Right?

16:28.265 --> 16:30.436
Not bad as far as
fresh air goes.

16:30.436 --> 16:32.398
I mean...

16:32.398 --> 16:35.029
it's not a remote island
in the Caribbean,

16:35.029 --> 16:36.866
but it's an island...

16:36.866 --> 16:38.620
slightly more populated.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.999
‐ I didn't take you for a guy
that went up on the roof.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.961
Little "head in the clouds,"
don't you think?

16:42.961 --> 16:46.969
‐ Hey, I have my moments of
contemplation and perspective.

16:48.263 --> 16:51.269
And I come up here
to day‐drink.

16:51.269 --> 16:53.315
Away from prying eyes.

16:56.739 --> 16:58.910
‐ I left him‐‐Cal‐‐

16:58.910 --> 17:00.956
or I don't know,
we're separated.

17:00.956 --> 17:02.918
It's all very confusing.

17:02.918 --> 17:05.548
But, um... at least
I'll have more time,

17:05.548 --> 17:08.053
I guess, to focus.

17:08.053 --> 17:09.765
‐ I'm sorry.

17:11.309 --> 17:12.938
Oh...

17:14.315 --> 17:17.320
Um, I want‐‐

17:17.320 --> 17:19.117
Can I...
‐ I'll take a hug.

17:19.117 --> 17:20.954
I consent to a hug.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.757
‐ Uh, you'll be okay.

17:26.757 --> 17:28.845
‐ Can I do something
truly awful?

17:28.845 --> 17:30.472
‐ I think so.

17:30.472 --> 17:32.393
‐ I haven't smoked
in two years,

17:32.393 --> 17:34.565
and I bought a cigarette off
a homeless person this morning,

17:34.565 --> 17:36.318
and I really want to smoke it.

17:36.318 --> 17:38.531
‐ Well, smoke!

17:38.531 --> 17:40.535
Environment be damned!

17:44.918 --> 17:46.672
What's that?

17:49.678 --> 17:52.601
Is everything okay?

17:52.601 --> 17:55.022
‐ I‐I‐I have to go...

17:55.022 --> 17:57.611
Back to the compound.
‐ Okay.

17:57.611 --> 17:59.615
Can I help in any way?
‐ I need a car.

17:59.615 --> 18:00.867
‐ Okay.

18:33.683 --> 18:36.062
‐ She's been sitting
like that for hours,

18:36.062 --> 18:39.318
just staring out the window.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.991
‐ Did anything happen
after I left this morning?

18:41.991 --> 18:43.911
‐ After you destroyed us?

18:43.911 --> 18:45.414
No.

18:45.414 --> 18:48.128
She's been like that
since we came home.

18:57.522 --> 18:58.941
‐ Felicia?

18:58.941 --> 19:00.695
‐ Should I call a doctor?

19:00.695 --> 19:03.534
‐ Just give me a minute.

19:03.534 --> 19:05.789
‐ She's gone into
some kind of shock.

19:05.789 --> 19:08.961
‐ Is there something...

19:08.961 --> 19:11.675
Whatever it is,

19:11.675 --> 19:14.305
we will get through it,
I promise you,

19:14.305 --> 19:16.769
but you need to tell me.

19:16.769 --> 19:18.689
‐ What are you doing, Sarah?

19:18.689 --> 19:20.693
‐ We need to finish this.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.114
‐ We were doing 7R.

19:23.114 --> 19:25.369
‐ Yes.

19:25.369 --> 19:28.250
‐ Reflective.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.047
Everything is revealed.

19:31.047 --> 19:33.301
‐ 115...

19:33.301 --> 19:35.640
94.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.434
‐ Concentrate.

19:37.434 --> 19:40.440
You must be able to recite it
backwards and forwards.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.696
‐ 115...

19:42.696 --> 19:45.075
94, 76,

19:45.075 --> 19:47.581
54, 32, 12,

19:47.581 --> 19:50.587
15... 7.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.674
‐ Forward.
Free yourself of delusions.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.678
‐ 7, 15,

19:54.678 --> 19:57.642
12, 32, 54,

19:57.642 --> 20:00.690
76, 94, 115.

20:00.690 --> 20:02.777
115, 94, 76, 54, 32...

20:02.777 --> 20:06.827
He told us
that he struggled...

20:08.330 --> 20:10.710
That he was ill.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.633
He said he had
unnatural thoughts

20:13.633 --> 20:15.469
that haunted him.

20:17.222 --> 20:19.226
‐ Thoughts about children?

20:20.688 --> 20:22.525
Thoughts about Cal?

20:22.525 --> 20:25.238
‐ I didn't know
about Cal specifically.

20:25.238 --> 20:27.493
‐ Oh, God.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.455
‐ We tried to reconcile,

20:29.455 --> 20:31.543
to make sense of why The Light

20:31.543 --> 20:34.800
would choose someone
so laden with Transgress

20:34.800 --> 20:36.804
to be our messenger.

20:38.599 --> 20:41.270
‐ Silas was there?
Silas knew, too.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.024
‐ Then we understood.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.364
The Light was testing us.

20:46.364 --> 20:48.451
It was testing our faith.

20:50.414 --> 20:53.003
We worked with him.

20:55.883 --> 20:58.471
We wouldn't give up
until we had cured him.

21:00.183 --> 21:02.021
‐ You didn't cure him.

21:05.444 --> 21:07.406
‐ We didn't know
what we know now

21:07.406 --> 21:10.203
about that sort of thing.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.499
We thought
we could make him well.

21:12.499 --> 21:15.338
We thought The Light
would make him well.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.514
We thought it had.

21:19.514 --> 21:21.685
I didn't know
that he had acted on it.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.606
I didn't know.

21:27.822 --> 21:29.826
‐ Hello?
‐ Is Cal there at Revelation?

21:29.826 --> 21:31.329
Can you see him?

21:31.329 --> 21:33.333
‐ Uh, no, I‐I haven't gone yet.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.799
‐ He's gonna kill himself,

21:36.799 --> 21:38.218
and Eddie's not answering
his phone.

21:38.218 --> 21:39.513
‐ Why would you say that?

21:39.513 --> 21:41.349
‐ He wrote a fucking note‐‐

21:41.349 --> 21:42.894
"In a place where
they won't find the body,

21:42.894 --> 21:44.438
and it will seem like
I've disappeared."

21:44.438 --> 21:46.234
He doesn't want me to deal‐‐
or‐‐or Forest.

21:46.234 --> 21:48.488
I‐I‐I need you
to help me, please.

21:48.488 --> 21:49.699
Please help me.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.839
‐ Hey. Glad you made it.

22:17.839 --> 22:20.093
‐ I hear he's gonna say
something epic tonight.

22:20.093 --> 22:22.389
‐ Let's‐‐let's hope so.

22:22.389 --> 22:24.059
‐ We're gonna be forced
to face ourselves,

22:24.059 --> 22:25.521
really face ourselves.

22:25.521 --> 22:27.482
That's what
Eddie Lane gives us.

22:42.847 --> 22:44.768
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

22:44.768 --> 22:46.855
‐ It's almost time.

22:46.855 --> 22:48.399
‐ Yeah.

22:48.399 --> 22:51.072
‐ We would have been
in Bali tonight.

22:51.072 --> 22:54.119
It might have been
your last night on Earth.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.292
We'll never know.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.421
‐ Don't do this.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.760
‐ Vera...
‐ I know.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.348
I know you think I am crazy

23:04.348 --> 23:06.645
for believing my mother,
but I do.

23:06.645 --> 23:09.818
She is a force
of anger and revenge,

23:09.818 --> 23:13.826
and that is real
and very powerful.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.707
But you, Eddie,
you're‐‐you're hope,

23:16.707 --> 23:19.420
and the world needs hope
right now.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.971
Please don't destroy this.

24:46.761 --> 24:48.557
‐ Hey, thank you.

24:48.557 --> 24:51.187
You know, I want to‐‐
I want to thank everyone

24:51.187 --> 24:54.234
for coming out tonight.

24:54.234 --> 24:56.907
For those of you who've been
with us a long time,

24:56.907 --> 25:00.413
I'm sure you're wondering
what Revelation is

25:00.413 --> 25:03.127
and where it came from.

25:03.127 --> 25:07.052
Well, that's the nature
of a Revelation.

25:07.052 --> 25:08.847
It strikes without warning.

25:08.847 --> 25:13.524
It breaks the way we see
the world entirely.

25:13.524 --> 25:17.907
Well, that's what
we are going to do tonight.

25:17.907 --> 25:21.790
We as a community
who seek Truth,

25:21.790 --> 25:24.712
we are going to
acknowledge the past

25:24.712 --> 25:28.094
and cleanse the wrongs.

25:47.508 --> 25:50.096
‐ Some things
have come to light

25:50.096 --> 25:53.436
about Dr. Steven Meyer,

25:53.436 --> 25:58.947
things that will be
difficult to reconcile.

26:03.749 --> 26:07.798
But at the end of all this,
I ask you to trust

26:07.798 --> 26:12.558
that I was chosen for a reason.

26:12.558 --> 26:17.275
Even though the man
who chose me...

26:17.275 --> 26:20.741
may have failed you,
I will not.

26:20.741 --> 26:23.079
Together,
we'll face our demons

26:23.079 --> 26:24.707
and reconcile the past.

26:24.707 --> 26:26.753
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ Mary called me.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.339
She said you wanted
to kill yourself

26:28.339 --> 26:29.967
in a place that
no one would find you,

26:29.967 --> 26:32.932
and this is the first place
that I thought of.

26:32.932 --> 26:35.269
She's very upset, Cal.

26:35.269 --> 26:37.273
‐ It'd be better for her
in the long run, and Forest.

26:37.273 --> 26:38.694
‐ Why?
‐ Sarah...

26:38.694 --> 26:40.363
‐ You have to talk to me.

26:40.363 --> 26:41.991
‐ I'm not talking to you
about this. You need to go.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.411
‐ Why would it be better
for Mary to lose you?

26:43.411 --> 26:45.123
‐ I should be
in the ground.

26:45.123 --> 26:47.293
I killed someone, and I could
do it again, believe me.

26:47.293 --> 26:49.423
I thought about, uh,
killing you and Eddie.

26:49.423 --> 26:51.093
‐ But you didn't...
‐ God, just‐‐

26:51.093 --> 26:52.805
‐ And you wouldn't.
‐ Get out of here, Sarah.

26:52.805 --> 26:54.433
‐ No, Forest, he needs you.
‐ I‐I'm asking you to go.

26:54.433 --> 26:55.686
‐ No, Cal.

26:55.686 --> 26:57.230
‐ Let me do this
the way I want.

26:57.230 --> 26:58.567
That's all I ask.
‐ Your son needs his father.

26:58.567 --> 26:59.861
I'm not
a fucking father, Sarah!

26:59.861 --> 27:01.238
‐ Yes, you are.
I've seen you.

27:01.238 --> 27:02.700
‐ What‐‐what,
carrying him around?

27:02.700 --> 27:04.244
Feeding him?
Anyone can do that.

27:04.244 --> 27:06.583
‐ No, that's not true.
‐ God, you have no idea!

27:06.583 --> 27:08.920
No idea!

27:08.920 --> 27:11.383
‐ I don't. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to‐‐

27:11.383 --> 27:13.847
I know you suffer,

27:13.847 --> 27:16.143
but I also know
how good you are.

27:16.143 --> 27:18.230
‐ I‐‐uh, I'm sick.

27:18.230 --> 27:19.859
Uh, alcoholic salesman...

27:19.859 --> 27:21.403
‐ No.
‐ And it'll catch to them.

27:21.403 --> 27:22.907
It already has.
‐ No, I don't believe you.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.367
I have known you
since I was a child.

27:24.367 --> 27:25.787
‐ You didn't know me.

27:25.787 --> 27:27.541
I was already ruined.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.545
‐ No, I didn't know what was
happening, that's true,

27:29.545 --> 27:31.381
but I‐I knew you.
‐ Just go, Sarah.

27:31.381 --> 27:33.260
‐ I wanted to be around you.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.764
I‐I loved you.

27:34.764 --> 27:36.350
‐ Yeah, and look
what I did to you.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.020
‐ Anything that I did,
I did to myself.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.567
‐ Pl‐‐please‐‐please stop this.
I need this.

27:40.567 --> 27:44.575
‐ I called you
earlier this year.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.704
I was in...

27:46.704 --> 27:48.583
a ton of pain,

27:48.583 --> 27:51.004
and you were the only one

27:51.004 --> 27:52.716
I could ask for help.

27:52.716 --> 27:54.344
‐ Yeah, because I was
the only one

27:54.344 --> 27:56.558
fucked up enough to understand.
‐ Maybe.

27:56.558 --> 27:58.770
What's so bad about that, huh?

27:58.770 --> 28:01.693
What's so bad about having
the capacity to understand

28:01.693 --> 28:05.324
someone else who is
so steeped in self‐loathing?

28:05.324 --> 28:07.287
I don't know...

28:07.287 --> 28:11.003
what it is for someone
to take my innocence,

28:11.003 --> 28:14.175
to destroy every sense...

28:14.175 --> 28:16.013
of normalcy,

28:16.013 --> 28:17.683
of how you get over that,

28:17.683 --> 28:20.647
of how you have any sense
of how to make a life.

28:20.647 --> 28:24.487
But I do know that the ugliness
that you feel inside of you,

28:24.487 --> 28:26.491
it's not you.

28:26.491 --> 28:29.582
‐ It is me, Sarah.
‐ It's them.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.878
Your mom...

28:31.878 --> 28:33.840
your dad, Steve...

28:33.840 --> 28:35.217
‐ It is me.

28:35.217 --> 28:38.892
‐ It is not you.

28:38.892 --> 28:40.729
‐ I just‐‐I just
want to get over it.

28:40.729 --> 28:43.150
I just want‐‐
I want to be over it.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.822
I need to be over it.

28:45.822 --> 28:48.160
- ‐ This isn't the way, okay?
- ‐

28:48.160 --> 28:49.997
‐ This isn't the way.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.924
Not this way.

28:54.924 --> 28:57.763
‐ I just need to be over it.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.391
‐ Not this way.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.862
‐ We have uncovered...

29:05.862 --> 29:09.995
some early diaries
of Steve's...

29:12.543 --> 29:14.630
Diaries that were written

29:14.630 --> 29:18.805
long before his climb
on Huayna Picchu.

29:18.805 --> 29:21.309
Now, these journals,

29:21.309 --> 29:23.773
they had another writer.

29:23.773 --> 29:25.986
This writer

29:25.986 --> 29:28.908
was the first person
to have the vision

29:28.908 --> 29:31.455
of The Ladder.

29:31.455 --> 29:33.125
‐ Does this mean the
Jackson Neill article is real?

29:33.125 --> 29:36.173
‐ No, the Jackson Neill article

29:36.173 --> 29:39.262
was filled with half‐truths
with the intent to harm, okay?

29:39.262 --> 29:40.974
What I am telling you now

29:40.974 --> 29:44.355
is everything you need to know
to be the strongest,

29:44.355 --> 29:46.986
most powerful version

29:46.986 --> 29:49.617
of The Light.

29:49.617 --> 29:52.455
The first vision of The Ladder

29:52.455 --> 29:57.381
was had by Lilith Assan
back in 1973.

29:58.968 --> 30:02.308
That was a year
before Steve made his climb.

30:02.308 --> 30:05.314
Now, that led me down a path

30:05.314 --> 30:08.487
of investigation
into Dr. Meyer's life.

30:08.487 --> 30:10.241
‐ Does this mean
this Lilith woman

30:10.241 --> 30:12.579
is the true prophet
of The Light?

30:15.544 --> 30:17.965
‐ No. No.

30:17.965 --> 30:21.221
I am the prophet...

30:24.185 --> 30:26.064
The son.

30:27.901 --> 30:30.532
I am...

30:30.532 --> 30:32.118
the one.

30:32.118 --> 30:33.621
‐ Mom?

30:47.691 --> 30:48.985
‐ Cal.

30:48.985 --> 30:51.448
‐ No! Hey!

30:55.707 --> 30:57.043
‐ Cal!

31:40.254 --> 31:42.133
Gaby...

31:44.930 --> 31:48.270
I still believe there's
a reason for all this.

31:49.606 --> 31:52.194
I do. I have no choice.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.411
There has to be,

31:56.411 --> 31:59.208
even for Steve.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.421
‐ Of course there's a reason.

32:03.509 --> 32:05.220
‐ Why'd she do it?

32:05.220 --> 32:07.601
‐ She was a very ill woman...

32:10.022 --> 32:13.320
Who had a lot of damage
through her life.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.533
‐ Did she want her to die?

32:15.533 --> 32:18.163
‐ No.
‐ She wanted Daddy to die?

32:20.794 --> 32:21.837
‐ Yes.

32:24.383 --> 32:26.555
‐ Vera saved your life?

32:28.100 --> 32:30.395
‐ Yes.

32:30.395 --> 32:32.149
She saved my life.

32:32.149 --> 32:35.990
‐ Will other people
try and shoot at us?

32:35.990 --> 32:38.411
‐ Hey...

32:38.411 --> 32:41.669
I'm going to do
everything in my power

32:41.669 --> 32:46.302
to make sure that nobody
ever shoots at us again.

32:46.302 --> 32:47.848
Okay?

32:51.981 --> 32:53.901
‐ Because of the contracts
we had your people sign,

32:53.901 --> 32:56.406
you are safe
from most of these lawsuits,

32:56.406 --> 32:57.784
but I will take you
through them

32:57.784 --> 32:59.245
so you understand
what's on the table.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.915
‐ Lawsuits...

33:00.915 --> 33:03.253
We were just shot at
a week ago.

33:03.253 --> 33:05.174
Someone very close
to us just died.

33:05.174 --> 33:07.261
Who the fuck
is filing lawsuits?

33:07.261 --> 33:10.225
‐ Parents of Novices,
Rodrigo and Smith.

33:10.225 --> 33:11.937
‐ All right, they're‐‐they're‐‐
they're‐‐they're done.

33:11.937 --> 33:14.233
Out, okay?
Fuck them and their parents.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.945
‐ And there are
two active Meyerists

33:15.945 --> 33:17.949
who are suing
for emotional distress,

33:17.949 --> 33:19.452
but both signed the waiver.

33:19.452 --> 33:21.080
‐ Can I sue them back?

33:21.080 --> 33:23.669
‐ Well, you can sue
anyone. I mean‐‐

33:23.669 --> 33:26.090
‐ I want to take on
the IRS, okay?

33:26.090 --> 33:27.761
I want religious status.

33:27.761 --> 33:29.472
No more fucking cult.

33:29.472 --> 33:32.979
‐ Mr. Lane, you've just been
through a huge trauma.

33:32.979 --> 33:34.942
I would advise any client

33:34.942 --> 33:36.695
who has gone through
what you've gone through

33:36.695 --> 33:38.490
to just take a few weeks to‐‐

33:38.490 --> 33:41.454
‐ Few weeks to what?

33:41.454 --> 33:42.791
‐ Grieve.

33:42.791 --> 33:44.795
‐ Right.

33:44.795 --> 33:46.924
What are you, my therapist?

33:46.924 --> 33:49.470
Or are you my fucking lawyer?

33:49.470 --> 33:51.642
‐ As your lawyer, I'm not sure
this is the right time

33:51.642 --> 33:53.813
to take on the IRS.

33:53.813 --> 33:56.401
The Jackson Neill article
is still fresh.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.821
His book will be out
in the spring,

33:57.821 --> 33:59.365
and there was a shooting
at your campus

33:59.365 --> 34:01.119
that is in every paper.

34:01.119 --> 34:04.710
‐ And we are going to double...

34:04.710 --> 34:07.590
triple our membership
by next year.

34:07.590 --> 34:11.347
Threats will rise,
and I have to protect them.

34:11.347 --> 34:15.313
First step is getting
religious recognition.

34:15.313 --> 34:17.443
If you don't want
to go against the IRS,

34:17.443 --> 34:21.659
then I am sure I can find
another lawyer who will.

34:23.204 --> 34:24.958
‐ I'm your lawyer.

34:24.958 --> 34:28.591
‐ And as for Jackson Neill's
forthcoming book...

34:28.591 --> 34:31.429
kill it.

34:39.529 --> 34:41.824
I read Vera's mother
hated the religion.

34:41.824 --> 34:43.536
They're threatened by us.

34:43.536 --> 34:45.833
‐ What else was Eddie going to
say at Revelation?

34:45.833 --> 34:48.589
‐ Steve wasn't the first
to climb The Ladder.

34:48.589 --> 34:50.342
A woman climbed it before him.

34:50.342 --> 34:52.096
‐ I‐I don't think
his actual words

34:52.096 --> 34:53.681
at this point are as important.

34:53.681 --> 34:55.310
‐ Why? Of course they are.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.938
‐ My parents think
we're all gonna get killed.

34:56.938 --> 34:58.818
‐ My parents are suing.

34:58.818 --> 35:01.657
‐ Vera just died
for this religion...

35:01.657 --> 35:05.665
because she loved The Light
more than herself,

35:05.665 --> 35:08.420
and that threatened
her mother so much

35:08.420 --> 35:10.465
that she tried to kill my dad.

35:10.465 --> 35:13.012
So it's a little hard for me
to hear you guys talk

35:13.012 --> 35:15.727
about going home and suing.

35:22.197 --> 35:24.076
I've lost a lot this year...

35:25.412 --> 35:27.040
My grandfather,

35:27.040 --> 35:29.170
my...

35:29.170 --> 35:30.965
But this,

35:30.965 --> 35:32.719
this loss...

35:35.767 --> 35:37.979
It makes me want to fight back.

35:39.315 --> 35:41.402
And I think that's what
my dad was talking about

35:41.402 --> 35:42.697
at Revelation...

35:44.701 --> 35:47.916
That we should have the courage
to look into the stories

35:47.916 --> 35:50.922
that our fathers tell us

35:50.922 --> 35:52.592
and not just
take them as fact,

35:52.592 --> 35:54.971
but develop our own ideas,

35:54.971 --> 35:56.767
our own perspectives

35:56.767 --> 35:58.646
and strive for authenticity

35:58.646 --> 36:00.482
and‐‐and not just‐‐

36:00.482 --> 36:04.156
‐ I know a guy that didn't have
the courage to do that...

36:04.156 --> 36:06.494
not at first, at any rate...

36:08.248 --> 36:11.087
'Cause‐‐'cause it can be
a terrifying thing to do.

36:13.968 --> 36:16.515
But he's glad he did, 'cause...

36:16.515 --> 36:18.811
if he didn't...

36:18.811 --> 36:20.690
it would've killed him.

36:24.029 --> 36:25.825
‐ Well, there you have it.

36:27.244 --> 36:29.123
If you want to go home...

36:30.543 --> 36:31.920
Go home.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.757
You might be happier there.

36:35.468 --> 36:38.224
But you might find
that it's not...

36:38.224 --> 36:40.312
your home anymore.

36:40.312 --> 36:42.065
But if you're here...

36:44.194 --> 36:46.365
Be here.

36:46.365 --> 36:50.583
Let us honor Vera Stephens

36:50.583 --> 36:54.298
by being as dedicated
to The Movement as she was.

37:14.046 --> 37:15.800
‐ Hey.
Thank you for coming.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.052
‐ Fuck you.

37:17.052 --> 37:19.181
Five minutes.

37:19.181 --> 37:21.812
‐ Uh‐‐uh, well, let me, um‐‐

37:21.812 --> 37:23.231
You want some tea?

37:23.231 --> 37:24.901
‐ No, you begged me
to come over.

37:24.901 --> 37:26.613
I'm really mad.
‐ Uh, you have every right‐‐

37:26.613 --> 37:28.116
‐ You know, you scared
the shit out of me.

37:28.116 --> 37:29.493
‐ I'm so sorry.
‐ And I went there,

37:29.493 --> 37:30.830
and I thought
that you were dead,

37:30.830 --> 37:32.416
but it was Vera,
and I saw her face.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.380
And it was awful.
‐ I'm so‐‐so‐‐I'm so sorry.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.009
‐ I'm here for Forest,

37:37.009 --> 37:38.721
so just tell me what
you needed to say in person

37:38.721 --> 37:40.140
and not over the phone.

37:40.140 --> 37:41.518
‐ No, it's‐‐
well, it's not that I‐‐

37:41.518 --> 37:42.854
it couldn't be said
on the phone.

37:42.854 --> 37:45.025
I just, um...

37:46.945 --> 37:49.033
I just wanted you to look
at me while I said it.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.870
‐ I'm looking.

37:50.870 --> 37:52.289
Say it.

37:52.289 --> 37:54.919
‐ I'm sorry...

37:54.919 --> 37:56.422
Mary.

37:58.969 --> 38:01.140
I'm so sorry.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.478
‐ What if you do it again?

38:03.478 --> 38:05.190
Do I have to live in fear?

38:05.190 --> 38:07.069
‐ Yeah‐‐
‐ You know, it's the worst‐‐

38:07.069 --> 38:08.864
‐ No. No, I won't.

38:08.864 --> 38:10.743
‐ Your word is shit.

38:10.743 --> 38:12.204
‐ I know.

38:13.999 --> 38:16.087
But I'm gonna get help,

38:16.087 --> 38:17.380
real help.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.884
I'm gonna start to do the work.

38:18.884 --> 38:21.347
I'm‐‐I'm gonna try to...

38:21.347 --> 38:24.646
deal with the fact that I was

38:24.646 --> 38:27.652
sexually abused for a decade.

38:27.652 --> 38:30.490
‐ But are you gonna stay
with the Meyerists?

38:32.410 --> 38:34.916
‐ For now, yeah.
‐ Why?

38:36.628 --> 38:38.131
‐ Um...

38:41.805 --> 38:43.642
Um‐‐

38:43.642 --> 38:46.021
Uh‐‐um, hard to explain,

38:46.021 --> 38:47.900
but, um...

38:49.027 --> 38:51.031
I'll try,
because you're asking.

38:51.031 --> 38:52.450
Um...

38:55.624 --> 38:57.753
It's like I‐‐

38:57.753 --> 38:59.298
I‐‐physically,
I can't walk away‐‐

38:59.298 --> 39:01.928
‐ Mentally,
you can't walk away.

39:01.928 --> 39:03.139
‐ Yeah, maybe.

39:03.139 --> 39:04.934
But, for whatever reason,
I can't,

39:04.934 --> 39:06.521
not yet, at any rate.

39:09.026 --> 39:13.034
I think about leaving with you,
and I want that, but...

39:13.034 --> 39:17.627
In the picture
I see of myself,

39:17.627 --> 39:19.254
I'm...

39:19.254 --> 39:21.217
I‐I'm‐‐I'm this shell
of a person.

39:21.217 --> 39:24.515
It's Florida all over again.
I have no purpose.

39:24.515 --> 39:26.060
I...

39:26.060 --> 39:28.439
I...
I work in a coffee shop.

39:28.439 --> 39:29.943
But it's more than that.

39:29.943 --> 39:31.905
It's this place
that ruined me...

39:34.243 --> 39:36.497
But it also saved me...

39:38.669 --> 39:42.133
And... it's home.

39:42.133 --> 39:45.683
And honestly... I love it.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.352
I‐I love...

39:49.022 --> 39:51.068
The people who need me,

39:51.068 --> 39:53.072
who want to be well.

39:55.368 --> 39:57.414
I love...

39:57.414 --> 39:59.334
the message of The Light.

39:59.334 --> 40:01.756
I love the whole idea of it.

40:05.096 --> 40:07.518
So I can't...

40:07.518 --> 40:10.481
walk away.

40:10.481 --> 40:12.027
Not yet.

40:12.027 --> 40:14.114
‐ You might never be able to.

40:16.076 --> 40:17.621
‐ I might not.

40:17.621 --> 40:19.584
But I...

40:21.755 --> 40:24.301
I think I can be
the man you love again.

40:25.971 --> 40:28.267
‐ You still are.
‐ No, but...

40:30.104 --> 40:32.693
But really worthy of you.

40:34.989 --> 40:37.035
I want to be.

40:55.531 --> 40:57.952
Thanks for meeting me.

40:57.952 --> 41:02.001
I couldn't bear to face you
earlier at the compound.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.256
‐ There's nothing
you could've done.

41:06.009 --> 41:08.305
‐ I could've listened.

41:08.305 --> 41:10.602
I could've left Lilith
in that fucking hospital!

41:10.602 --> 41:13.775
‐ I'm just as much to blame
as you are, Eddie.

41:13.775 --> 41:16.029
You know, I found Lilith,
and I begged you to see her.

41:16.029 --> 41:18.660
‐ She was already
in our lives.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.290
She was the one
who sent Vera to us,

41:21.290 --> 41:24.505
who I begged to take
her job back, by the way.

41:24.505 --> 41:26.843
She shouldn't have
even been there.

41:26.843 --> 41:29.097
‐ She wanted to be there.

41:29.097 --> 41:31.101
She wanted to help you, Eddie.

41:31.101 --> 41:33.565
‐ No, she didn't want me
to dig up shit.

41:34.692 --> 41:38.282
She wanted to move forward,
let the past be the past.

41:38.282 --> 41:41.038
‐ That's not how it works.

41:41.038 --> 41:43.083
The Truth is the only way
to move forward.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.421
‐ Okay, then tell me...

41:47.175 --> 41:50.473
Do you feel anything?

41:50.473 --> 41:52.352
Any Light?

41:53.772 --> 41:55.776
‐ Why are you asking me this?

41:55.776 --> 41:58.113
‐ Because I promised you

41:58.113 --> 42:02.957
that if we did this that
everything would be real again.

42:02.957 --> 42:06.046
Is it?
‐ We're not finished.

42:06.046 --> 42:09.177
I don't know.
‐ You found Cal.

42:09.177 --> 42:11.933
Sarah, you saved his life.

42:11.933 --> 42:13.603
You don't‐‐
you don't feel anything?

42:13.603 --> 42:14.814
‐ I don't know.

42:16.316 --> 42:19.322
Is that why you asked me
to meet you?

42:19.322 --> 42:22.621
To find out if I believe again?

42:22.621 --> 42:26.461
‐ No, I asked you to meet me
because...

42:26.461 --> 42:28.424
I need you.

42:28.424 --> 42:31.471
Whatever I do next,
I want you there.

42:31.471 --> 42:33.058
‐ I hounded you.

42:33.058 --> 42:34.895
I doubted you,
and I almost got you killed.

42:34.895 --> 42:36.691
‐ No, you didn't
almost get me killed.

42:36.691 --> 42:38.862
‐ But I don't know
what I would've done...

42:38.862 --> 42:41.325
all right, if I‐‐
if I came home and‐‐

42:43.580 --> 42:45.667
And I lost you.

42:45.667 --> 42:47.755
‐ Hey, hey, hey...

42:47.755 --> 42:49.967
Then don't.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.929
Don't lose me.

42:51.929 --> 42:55.436
Stand by me.

42:55.436 --> 42:57.440
Okay?

42:57.440 --> 42:59.235
Whatever I do next...

43:01.198 --> 43:03.828
Because I know

43:03.828 --> 43:06.500
who I become without you.

43:21.405 --> 43:23.785
‐ She's ready to transition.

43:27.166 --> 43:28.920
Whenever you're ready.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.178
‐ I remembered, uh...

43:33.178 --> 43:35.182
being a child with her.

43:35.182 --> 43:37.813
The summer that
Vera was with us,

43:37.813 --> 43:40.694
it was too complicated
for Steve

43:40.694 --> 43:43.825
to find the time for me.

43:43.825 --> 43:46.204
And, um...

43:46.204 --> 43:48.543
that month, he was‐‐

43:48.543 --> 43:50.505
uh, he was like
a real father to me.

43:53.887 --> 43:55.974
I wanted to tell her that.

44:45.281 --> 44:47.410
Shall we begin the prayer?

44:49.205 --> 44:51.878
‐ As the owl protects
The Garden,

44:51.878 --> 44:54.800
we offer these wings to Vera

44:54.800 --> 44:57.681
to carry her home...

44:57.681 --> 45:00.687
to be her guide.

45:00.687 --> 45:03.191
We believe in The Light.

45:03.191 --> 45:07.158
We believe that
Vera Stephens is Light,

45:07.158 --> 45:08.953
for all this was revealed...

45:08.953 --> 45:10.832
‐ To Ste‐‐
‐ To Steven Meyer.

45:14.255 --> 45:17.638
‐ For all of this
was revealed...

45:17.638 --> 45:19.098
to me...

45:20.518 --> 45:23.065
When I was struck by The Light.

45:24.777 --> 45:28.325
Therefore, we invite Vera

45:28.325 --> 45:31.039
to leave her earthly form,

45:31.039 --> 45:34.964
for in ending, we begin,

45:34.964 --> 45:37.259
and in sorrow,

45:37.259 --> 45:39.974
we rejoice...

45:39.974 --> 45:41.811
And in darkness...

45:44.733 --> 45:46.988
There is Light.

45:52.749 --> 45:54.502
‐ Lilith?

45:59.095 --> 46:01.182
We're burying your child today.

46:26.942 --> 46:28.529
Good‐bye.

46:48.861 --> 46:51.074
‐ Don't be sad.

46:59.675 --> 47:01.261
‐ Our daughter had to die.

47:01.261 --> 47:04.308
She sacrificed herself
for The Truth.

47:04.308 --> 47:06.605
I'm sorry that
I stole it from you.

47:06.605 --> 47:08.818
I wanted the end to come‐‐

47:08.818 --> 47:10.780
The Cleanse.

47:10.780 --> 47:13.786
We would never have been
able to shed ourselves

47:13.786 --> 47:17.084
of the suffering
and wickedness on our own,

47:17.084 --> 47:18.880
as much as I tried.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.217
I wanted your vision

47:21.217 --> 47:23.388
of the new world,

47:23.388 --> 47:26.604
and I knew we wouldn't grow
the way we needed

47:26.604 --> 47:28.481
with you at the helm.

47:30.444 --> 47:32.198
‐ I won't thank you.

47:32.198 --> 47:35.454
‐ Now it will grow greater
than we ever imagined.

47:36.999 --> 47:39.420
‐ Greater
than we ever imagined.

47:39.420 --> 47:41.508
‐ And the end will come.

47:43.888 --> 47:46.267
‐ And the end will come.

48:55.740 --> 49:00.958
‐ Today we stand
as a community...

49:00.958 --> 49:06.427
bound together
by a painful reality...

49:06.427 --> 49:09.225
that there is darkness

49:09.225 --> 49:12.314
in this world...

49:12.314 --> 49:16.865
a darkness intent
on destroying the forces

49:16.865 --> 49:20.665
of peace, tolerance, and hope.

49:20.665 --> 49:22.084
Why?

49:23.504 --> 49:25.925
Where does this anger

49:25.925 --> 49:28.556
and damage come from?

49:28.556 --> 49:31.562
Is it our fathers?

49:31.562 --> 49:33.816
Our mothers?

49:35.528 --> 49:37.072
I don't know.

49:37.072 --> 49:39.870
But I can promise

49:39.870 --> 49:42.124
to fight it.

49:42.124 --> 49:44.504
I can promise to make sure

49:44.504 --> 49:49.180
nothing like this
ever happens again...

49:49.180 --> 49:52.562
by cleansing our past

49:52.562 --> 49:55.943
and removing the rot.

49:55.943 --> 49:58.824
In light of everything,
I think it's time

49:58.824 --> 50:01.663
that we sever
this relationship.

50:01.663 --> 50:04.210
‐ It was real.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.632
I saw it.

50:06.632 --> 50:08.176
I tried to climb‐‐

50:08.176 --> 50:10.347
‐ Thank you
for your service, Felicia.

50:28.466 --> 50:30.262
My son.

50:30.262 --> 50:31.682
‐ Yeah?

50:31.682 --> 50:33.393
‐ The Embrace?

50:33.393 --> 50:35.606
That was Steve's thing.

50:35.606 --> 50:38.862
Um, and I'm Forest's father,

50:38.862 --> 50:41.158
and I'm his only father.

50:45.041 --> 50:49.300
‐ And building a fortress
of protection around us.

51:18.358 --> 51:21.698
‐ So that we can meet
each other today...

51:23.117 --> 51:25.539
Fresh...

51:25.539 --> 51:30.090
dedicated to what The Light
wants from us now.

51:42.322 --> 51:47.207
‐ Because even though
today feels bleak...

51:53.804 --> 51:58.146
Even though we are
overwhelmed by grief,

51:58.146 --> 51:59.899
it will lift.

52:05.160 --> 52:09.627
The sky will brighten,

52:09.627 --> 52:13.886
and we will grow
stronger than ever.

52:13.886 --> 52:16.432
The state will recognize us

52:16.432 --> 52:18.436
as a religion,

52:18.436 --> 52:22.319
and our message will be spoken

52:22.319 --> 52:25.701
throughout this world.

52:27.037 --> 52:29.041
‐ And I make a promise to you

52:29.041 --> 52:32.799
to govern against the forces
that threaten this great city.

52:37.850 --> 52:40.271
‐ Today we must declare war

52:40.271 --> 52:44.279
on the forces that are
stealing our children's souls.

52:44.279 --> 52:48.204
‐ We will not let their threats
silence our belief.

53:04.319 --> 53:06.741
‐ Vera died

53:06.741 --> 53:10.206
so that it would be so.

53:10.206 --> 53:13.421
She sacrificed herself...

53:13.421 --> 53:15.300
for us...

53:15.300 --> 53:18.891
for you, for me.

53:35.048 --> 53:37.469
She had a dream of a garden

53:37.469 --> 53:39.264
right here.

53:43.857 --> 53:46.445
Help me build it.

53:49.201 --> 53:52.374
Stand next to me tomorrow...

53:52.374 --> 53:55.506
because I can't do this
without you.
