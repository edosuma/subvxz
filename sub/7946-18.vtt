15:48.876 --> 15:51.834
to the spirit world?

15:51.876 --> 15:53.083
Bridge, tunnel or seance?

15:54.918 --> 15:56.375
- Thank you for
- being here, Tony.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.751

Oh, no, Abigail's

16:02.002 --> 16:03.042
come for us!

16:03.083 --> 16:04.105
Uh, I'm not ready!

16:04.106 --> 16:05.125
I've never been to Japan,

16:05.167 --> 16:06.771
and the Spice Girls

16:06.772 --> 16:08.375
never gave their fans

16:05.167 --> 16:08.375
that reunion we deserved!

16:10.250 --> 16:11.750
Relax, it's just my

16:11.751 --> 16:13.250
Halloween ringtone.

16:13.292 --> 16:15.022
(GASPS) Look, it's a

16:15.023 --> 16:16.751
video call from Stuart!

16:17.918 --> 16:19.626
- Stuart!
- Are you okay?

16:19.667 --> 16:20.980
Guys, I don't

16:20.981 --> 16:22.292
have much time.

16:19.667 --> 16:22.292
I found the others.

16:22.334 --> 16:23.376
We're safe,

16:23.377 --> 16:24.417
but I don't know

16:22.334 --> 16:24.417
for how long.

16:24.459 --> 16:25.730
Come quick.

16:25.731 --> 16:27.000
Abigail! Ahh!

16:27.876 --> 16:29.959
Stuart, come back!

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Wow, never thought

16:31.001 --> 16:32.001
I'd say that.

- (SIGHS)
- Oh, no.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.101
- He didn't tell us
- where he was.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.876
- Now we'll never
- find them!

16:37.918 --> 16:39.397
Wait! Didn't you

16:39.398 --> 16:40.876
see the skeletons

16:37.918 --> 16:40.876
and the cobwebs?

16:40.918 --> 16:41.980
Maybe they're in

16:41.981 --> 16:43.042
the haunted house

16:40.918 --> 16:43.042
in Central Park!

16:43.083 --> 16:45.042
Tony, you're a genius!

16:45.083 --> 16:46.542
Wow, I never thought

16:46.543 --> 16:48.000
I'd say that, either.

Do we really

16:59.565 --> 17:00.584
need to find them?

17:00.626 --> 17:01.813
I'd be happy

17:01.814 --> 17:03.000
as an only child.

- to get you,

- She's gonna have
- to go through me.

So, Stuart is the mystery

18:03.252 --> 18:04.292
host of this party?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.042
Uh, wait, party?

18:07.083 --> 18:08.167
I thought a ghost

18:08.168 --> 18:09.250
was about to take you

18:07.083 --> 18:09.250
to a parallel universe!

18:09.292 --> 18:11.083
(LAUGHS) Hardly!

18:11.125 --> 18:13.084
We were all invited

18:13.085 --> 18:15.042
to attend the coolest

18:11.125 --> 18:15.042
Halloween bash in New York.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.188
Yeah, thrown by

18:16.189 --> 18:17.292
a super-cool host.

18:17.334 --> 18:18.688
Who we just found out

18:18.689 --> 18:20.042
is Stuart Wooten.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.542
Wait, maybe we are

18:21.543 --> 18:23.000
in a parallel universe.

18:24.667 --> 18:25.855
But why didn't you

18:25.856 --> 18:27.042
kids tell anyone

18:24.667 --> 18:27.042
where you were going?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.584
- Bertram and I...
- Well...

18:28.626 --> 18:30.209
- I have been
- worried sick!

18:30.250 --> 18:31.647
What? Didn't you

18:31.648 --> 18:33.042
see the invitation?

18:30.250 --> 18:33.042
What invitation?

18:33.083 --> 18:34.251
The one at the end

18:34.252 --> 18:35.417
of the ChatSnap video?

18:35.459 --> 18:36.543
Come on,

18:36.544 --> 18:37.626
I'll show you.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.709
So you sent the videos,

18:48.751 --> 18:50.209
haunted the lobby,

18:50.210 --> 18:51.667
and threw this party.

18:48.751 --> 18:51.667
But why?

18:51.709 --> 18:53.584
- Because you guys
- thought I wasn't cool,

18:53.626 --> 18:55.459
- And I wanted
- to prove you wrong.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.543
Also, I have

18:56.544 --> 18:57.584
a lot of free time.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.042
- So, you made me
- come down here

19:01.083 --> 19:02.313
And miss the unmasking

19:02.314 --> 19:03.542
of the man of my dreams,

19:03.584 --> 19:04.647
just so you could prove

19:04.648 --> 19:05.709
how cool you are?

19:05.751 --> 19:06.917
In my defense,

19:06.918 --> 19:08.083
you weren't really invited.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.126
Oh, excuse me, have you

19:14.127 --> 19:15.584
seen Albert Einstein?

19:15.626 --> 19:18.375
Every night in my dreams.

19:18.417 --> 19:19.814

19:21.250 --> 19:22.250
Where did you get all

19:22.251 --> 19:23.251
those credit cards?

19:23.292 --> 19:25.209
From my purse.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.083
I like your wig.

19:39.084 --> 19:40.084
Oh, thank you.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.000
- I made it from hair
- I found on the bus.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.584
- I find that
- strangely enticing.

- Thank you,
- my stunning steed.

19:55.751 --> 19:57.542
It was a great party, Stuart.

19:57.584 --> 19:59.292
- Just not the one
- I hoped for.

19:59.334 --> 20:01.417
We are very sorry you

20:01.418 --> 20:03.500
missed the unmasking of

19:59.334 --> 20:03.500
your dream date, Jessie.

20:03.542 --> 20:04.792
Maybe it's not too late.

20:04.834 --> 20:05.939
Face it, guys,

20:05.940 --> 20:07.042
I'll never see

20:04.834 --> 20:07.042
that face.

With my dating luck,

20:09.210 --> 20:11.334
the next masked man

20:07.083 --> 20:11.334
I meet will be a burglar.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.209
Or, your mysterious stranger

20:13.210 --> 20:15.042
could still be there,

20:11.375 --> 20:15.042
waiting for you.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.459
What am I still doing here?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.417
- Emma, use your cape
- to pay for a cab home.

based on lies!

20:32.417 --> 20:34.083
- Tell that to
- your muscles.

20:44.584 --> 20:45.751
You came back!

20:45.792 --> 20:47.167
You waited for me?

20:47.209 --> 20:49.042
Of course, I waited.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.000
A lot longer than you know.

20:56.083 --> 20:56.834
Tony?

20:56.876 --> 21:00.042
It was you all along?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.083
Why didn't you just

21:01.084 --> 21:02.084
tell me who you were?

21:02.125 --> 21:03.250
I wanted you to see me

21:03.251 --> 21:04.375
in a different light.

(LAUGHS)

21:05.751 --> 21:07.083
Well, you succeeded.

Wait, are you really

21:08.231 --> 21:09.334
joining the fire academy?

21:09.375 --> 21:10.793
Yup, it's been a dream

21:10.794 --> 21:12.209
of mine since I was

21:09.375 --> 21:12.209
a little kid.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.834
Tony, that's amazing.

21:14.459 --> 21:16.042
You know what?

21:16.083 --> 21:17.751
I am really sorry.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.189
It was wrong of me

21:19.190 --> 21:20.584
to assume you didn't

21:17.792 --> 21:20.584
have big dreams, too.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.522
See? We still have

21:22.523 --> 21:24.417
a lot to learn about

21:20.626 --> 21:24.417
each other after all.

21:24.459 --> 21:25.543
(CHUCKLES)

21:25.544 --> 21:26.626
I guess so.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.397
You don't have a bellybutton

21:28.398 --> 21:30.125
I don't know about, do you?

21:26.667 --> 21:30.125
(TONY LAUGHS)

21:30.167 --> 21:32.083
- No, the doctor
- filled that in.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.834
So, despite that,

21:37.417 --> 21:38.626
do you think the spark

21:38.627 --> 21:39.834
is still there?

21:39.876 --> 21:41.584
- It could burn down
- this whole park.

21:41.626 --> 21:42.834
(TONY LAUGHS)

21:42.876 --> 21:44.334
I hope not.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.226
- I'm still on the - rescuing kittens
- From trees chapter.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.834

21:47.876 --> 21:50.626
Oh, and before I forget,

21:50.667 --> 21:51.667
I wanted to give this

21:51.668 --> 21:52.668
to you at midnight.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.876
Okay, wait,

21:55.918 --> 21:57.335
the red rose, the mask,

21:57.336 --> 21:58.751
the black cape...

21:58.792 --> 22:00.560
- Which one of the kids
- told you about my dream?

22:00.584 --> 22:02.000
What dream?

22:03.125 --> 22:04.709
Never mind.

22:04.751 --> 22:06.397
I guess, sometimes dreams

22:06.398 --> 22:08.042
really do come true after all.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.167
Mine just did.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.251
Tony?

22:17.252 --> 22:18.417
Yes, Jessie.

22:18.459 --> 22:19.606
Could we leave?

22:19.607 --> 22:20.751
That gondolier is

22:18.459 --> 22:20.751
really freaking me out.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.167
(JESSIE LAUGHS)

22:27.125 --> 22:28.959
- Okay, let's watch the
- surveillance footage

22:29.000 --> 22:30.834
- And see who kept
- stealing the candy.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.250
Stuart, you were the thief?

22:36.292 --> 22:37.501
As if I would touch

22:37.502 --> 22:38.709
communal candy!

22:38.751 --> 22:39.876
The germs,

22:39.877 --> 22:41.000
people, the germs!

22:42.125 --> 22:44.042
- Wait, look at
- the time stamp!

22:44.083 --> 22:45.418
At that hour,

22:45.419 --> 22:46.751
Stuart was with us.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.250
Well, then...

22:49.292 --> 22:50.334
Who's that?

ALL: (GASPING) Abigail!
