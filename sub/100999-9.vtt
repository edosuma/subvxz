WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.701
Previously on Condor...

00:02.969 --> 00:04.195
You're not going to break me.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.431
Challenge accepted...

00:05.445 --> 00:08.210
It's about CHS Phoenix.
He's sent up an SOS.

00:08.219 --> 00:10.281
My people are on to me.
I'm being watched.

00:10.383 --> 00:11.367
Requesting asylum...

00:11.391 --> 00:13.453
Breathe! Breathe!

00:14.844 --> 00:16.710
She was working for the CIA!

00:17.507 --> 00:20.757
Senator Thrush is pursuing an
obstruction of justice charge against you.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.702
Someone gave a sealed deposition.

00:22.749 --> 00:24.549
Hello?
- We're going to war.

00:24.609 --> 00:27.275
With a 17-year-old boy?
- And the mother.

00:27.733 --> 00:28.733
I'm ready

00:28.764 --> 00:29.928
Did you find Vasili?

00:29.984 --> 00:32.725
Vasili is not in a very
trusting mood just yet.

00:32.780 --> 00:35.155
Doesn't he know who the mole is?
Isn't that what started all this?

00:35.202 --> 00:38.569
He was bluffing. He said he
knew that there was a mole...

00:38.585 --> 00:40.105
Just not who it is.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.132
His friend Arkady Volk told him.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.788
You told Sirin about me?

00:43.866 --> 00:44.960
We should talk about it...

00:44.976 --> 00:47.132
I'm done talking. You just
about got me burned.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.272
We need to get to Volk.

00:48.303 --> 00:49.592
That's not possible.

00:49.662 --> 00:51.810
It's the only way. He's the only one
who knows the identity of the mole.

00:51.842 --> 00:53.060
You won't get near him.

00:53.076 --> 00:54.420
I think I know someone who can.

00:55.928 --> 00:57.288
I need your help.

01:45.274 --> 01:47.383
Lior's business is financed
by the Kremlin.

01:47.415 --> 01:50.008
He took money from them?
- He's an SVR asset.

01:50.025 --> 01:51.790
I didn't do this to you.
You did this to yourself.

01:51.806 --> 01:56.685
Frankly, the only part I'm having a hard time
believing is how anybody can be such a loser.

01:56.822 --> 01:58.665
What did you do, Gordon?

01:58.853 --> 02:01.053
Gordon, what the fuck did you do?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.002
Let's go, Piper

03:16.260 --> 03:18.760
You guys keep asking the same questions.
I keep giving the same answers.

03:18.768 --> 03:21.033
You know how Einstein defined insanity?

03:21.058 --> 03:22.823
Just because you drag me out
of bed in the middle of the night...

03:22.831 --> 03:24.440
Give it a rest, man.
Your wife is here.

03:55.049 --> 03:56.470
Don't fuck in there.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.260
Baby, what happened to your face

03:58.478 --> 04:00.197
What did you do to him?
Did you hit him?

04:00.197 --> 04:01.080
He didn't hit me

04:01.080 --> 04:01.908
Who hit you?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.588
Baby, leave it alone.

04:06.485 --> 04:09.641
We'd like some privacy, please.
- You've got five minutes.

04:12.243 --> 04:13.243
You're OK?

04:14.653 --> 04:16.028
I don't want you in here right now.

04:16.053 --> 04:17.920
Sydney called in some favors

04:17.935 --> 04:20.380
Jesus? What did you tell the kids?

04:20.514 --> 04:21.826
That you were working

04:22.139 --> 04:24.627
It's not that I could have
told them much else.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.951
I've got no fucking clue what's going on.

04:28.522 --> 04:30.789
Gordon, what the fuck is going on?

04:41.254 --> 04:43.854
They think I'm spying for the Russians.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.489
Did you tell them they're wrong?

04:52.896 --> 04:53.356
Yes

04:53.381 --> 04:54.732
Did you tell them
they're fucking stupid and

04:54.732 --> 04:57.060
they should have their
collective head examined?

04:58.484 --> 05:00.551
How do you know I didn't do it?

05:02.672 --> 05:03.672
Gordon...

05:07.511 --> 05:09.104
I know you.

05:09.519 --> 05:12.252
You're not a liar and
you're not a cheat.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.793
I took money from a guy who
works for Russian intelligence.

05:26.462 --> 05:29.516
Did you know? That he
worked for Russian intelligence?

05:29.541 --> 05:31.228
No, he offered me a job.

05:31.283 --> 05:34.767
I...I asked him to
advance me some money

05:36.869 --> 05:38.549
You mean he set you up?

05:43.104 --> 05:44.104
Yeah.

05:46.770 --> 05:49.293
I'm just so tired...

05:53.223 --> 05:56.743
Despite what you thing,
I never, ever lost faith in you.

05:58.195 --> 06:00.087
How much longer are you
going to keep that up for?

06:00.118 --> 06:02.782
For fucking ever!
Okay?

06:02.838 --> 06:05.134
You do not get to go to your dark place!

06:05.235 --> 06:07.189
I need you here.
I need you with me.

06:07.214 --> 06:10.565
If...I don't go to jail

06:10.698 --> 06:14.479
for accepting money from a
foreign intelligence agent...

06:14.487 --> 06:17.659
...which is a big fucking if

06:20.198 --> 06:21.206
I'll never get a job again.

06:21.206 --> 06:24.370
My reputation is permanently ruined.

06:24.424 --> 06:26.948
Honey, it's not going to come to that, okay?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.994
Sydney already said the
reason that they've kept this quiet...

06:30.019 --> 06:32.441
is 'cause they don't have
the evidence to charge you.

06:32.449 --> 06:35.323
They're on a fucking fishing
expedition, okay?

06:35.409 --> 06:37.089
Now we are getting you out of here

06:37.105 --> 06:40.198
and we are going to sue the
shit out of these motherfuckers.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.175
What?
- We're going to sue the government?

06:42.175 --> 06:45.675
Yes, we are going to sue
everybody, babe. Everybody.

06:47.463 --> 06:50.450
How are you even doing this right now?
Where is this energy coming from?

06:50.451 --> 06:51.474
Go with it.

06:51.474 --> 06:54.934
My love for you is a very
fucking powerful thing.

06:55.020 --> 06:55.895
All right?

06:55.942 --> 06:59.192
And anybody who messes
with that better watch their ass!

06:59.192 --> 07:00.872
Okay. Now we are
fighting for you out there.

07:00.895 --> 07:03.708
And you've got to promise
me that you are fighting in here.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.887
You tell me you're
gonna fight, Gordon.

07:07.871 --> 07:09.551
I'm gonna fight.
- Yeah?

07:11.379 --> 07:12.730
Fuck, yeah!

07:15.559 --> 07:16.559
Good.

07:17.207 --> 07:19.004
Let's go...

07:26.001 --> 07:29.102
I'm sorry for putting
you through all this.

07:30.454 --> 07:32.721
I can do this standing on my head.

07:32.782 --> 07:35.446
You're amazing.
I don't deserve you.

07:35.603 --> 07:37.203
Yes, you fucking do.

07:42.734 --> 07:43.734
I love you.

08:23.558 --> 08:25.238
How's my fucking wife?

08:33.833 --> 08:35.912
Did you ever think that maybe the
Russians were setting Gordon up?

08:36.264 --> 08:38.224
Is it the same photo
from Bob's office?

08:38.388 --> 08:40.788
What if it was put
there as a plant?

08:41.429 --> 08:43.756
You got Gordon served
to you on a silver platter

08:43.782 --> 08:45.835
by a single source
inside the SVR

08:45.867 --> 08:48.267
whose identity is
known only to you?

08:50.387 --> 08:51.784
I feel like they know.

08:52.910 --> 08:54.628
Maybe you were the one
who was approached...

08:56.855 --> 08:57.855
Fuck!

09:33.946 --> 09:35.306
Well, she's coming.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.094
How did you get
her to agree to that?

09:38.135 --> 09:40.071
I told her to come
hear what we had to say

09:40.071 --> 09:42.672
and if she didn't like it,
we'd part as friends.

09:50.898 --> 09:53.569
And I said if she didn't
come I'd show up at her office.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.761
That was stupid.

10:01.605 --> 10:03.519
You know, I guessed
this is what would happen.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.917
Maybe she's not coming.

10:32.178 --> 10:34.512
And maybe she's
not coming to talk.

10:36.624 --> 10:37.959
You think she'd do that?

10:38.014 --> 10:40.586
She's not someone you want as your enemy.

10:40.602 --> 10:43.508
You're scared she's gonna
hold my actions against you.

10:43.759 --> 10:46.092
I just told you
what I'm scared of.

10:49.596 --> 10:55.002
I had this whole plan in my
mind about how this would all go.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.332
Now, looking back, it
all seems so naive.

10:59.215 --> 11:01.015
Happens to me all the time.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.683
Yet we continue to make plans.

11:21.689 --> 11:23.321
Your girlfriend fall asleep?

11:25.275 --> 11:27.407
You trying to give me a heart attack, man?

11:28.236 --> 11:31.657
I wasn't sure if this would be
a negotiation or a dung fight.

11:31.689 --> 11:33.517
Figured I'd better see you first.

11:33.517 --> 11:35.251
That how bad things
have got between us?

11:35.345 --> 11:38.852
Last time we spoke you dictated the terms
of your retirement to me via blackmail

11:39.048 --> 11:44.165
And you got drunk and told Vasili Sirin
you had an asset operating inside the CIA.

11:44.197 --> 11:48.671
I made a mistake.
I trusted Vasili like a brother

11:49.070 --> 11:51.070
but I never told him your name.

11:51.827 --> 11:53.382
My loyalties aren't changing.

11:53.382 --> 11:56.850
You know, it don't seem fair that the
man who recruited me to be a double agent

11:56.859 --> 11:59.125
would criticize me for disloyalty.

11:59.734 --> 12:01.757
D'you think we were
going to do this forever?

12:02.062 --> 12:04.195
What was the point of killing
Partridge and setting up Gordon

12:04.195 --> 12:05.936
if I'm not free to live my life?

12:07.163 --> 12:10.053
Just tell me what I need to
do to be done and I'll do it.

12:10.445 --> 12:11.805
Isn't it obvious?

12:12.577 --> 12:15.991
There's an extremely resourceful
man whose life is on the line

12:16.570 --> 12:19.554
and the only way he can save
it is by discovering who you are

12:19.554 --> 12:22.498
and selling that information
to the Americans.

12:23.101 --> 12:25.858
Neither one of us will be
safe until he's eliminated.

12:54.404 --> 12:57.271
I'm going to start
calling you "boomerang".

12:57.474 --> 12:59.154
You look like you're dying.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.645
Probably quite soon.

13:02.013 --> 13:03.599
Not soon enough.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.255
You could have been dead already.

13:06.412 --> 13:08.763
I could have finished you.

13:09.224 --> 13:11.357
It would have made more sense.

13:12.415 --> 13:15.679
She says she helped me
against her better judgment

13:16.331 --> 13:18.924
You, too. I could have
killed you in the woods.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.916
Oh, yeah?
Why didn't you?

13:21.065 --> 13:24.041
Because I had a soft spot for this one,
but it hardened overnight.

13:24.143 --> 13:26.343
Your boss framed
an innocent man.

13:26.495 --> 13:27.855
Innocent to whom?

13:28.534 --> 13:30.877
You are not on my side,
neither is Piper.

13:30.948 --> 13:33.924
So he wasn't on your side?
So I'm right?

13:34.339 --> 13:36.019
Gordon isn't the mole.

13:36.865 --> 13:38.060
So who is?

13:40.240 --> 13:43.029
Katya. I made a mistake

13:44.926 --> 13:47.660
This is the only way
to put things right.

13:48.090 --> 13:50.757
You're making another
mistake right now.

13:51.815 --> 13:53.495
I don't know who it is.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.580
It's the truth.

13:55.958 --> 13:57.403
Volk didn't trust me with that.

13:57.654 --> 13:58.794
I don't think he trusts me at all

13:58.827 --> 14:00.599
I need to find out who it is.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.153
You should ask him yourself.
- I'm ready to do that.

14:03.435 --> 14:05.302
You will never get near him.

14:05.528 --> 14:07.653
You don't even know
what my plan is yet.

14:09.612 --> 14:13.064
Watch out for this one.
He wants to kill himself.

14:13.299 --> 14:14.979
She says you're suicidal

14:24.240 --> 14:28.536
The next time we meet,
it'll be as enemies.

14:34.716 --> 14:36.263
You too.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.345
She said...
- Yeah, I know what she said.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.051
Listen!
- I'm done listening to you.

14:49.643 --> 14:50.651
Then listen to yourself...

14:50.756 --> 14:52.120
You could have been dead already.

14:52.198 --> 14:54.589
I could have finished you.

14:54.988 --> 14:57.768
It would have made more sense.

14:58.210 --> 15:01.538
She says she helped me
against her better judgment.

15:02.163 --> 15:04.623
You, too. I could have
killed you in the woods.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.670
Oh, yeah,
Why didn't you?

15:06.999 --> 15:10.270
Because I had a soft spot for this one,
but it hardened overnight.

15:13.138 --> 15:14.169
I should kill you.

15:14.341 --> 15:17.856
If you don't help us then this goes
to the Russian embassy in 24 hours.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.684
You were right. We're
not on the same team

15:22.061 --> 15:23.459
This was a helpful reminder.

15:23.459 --> 15:26.359
You are punching way
above your weight class.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.099
How?

15:32.115 --> 15:34.841
We lure Volk to a secure
location, we kidnap him...

15:34.866 --> 15:38.341
and then we force the identity of the
mole out of him by any means necessary.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.927
Hey, we're going to try something crazy.

15:46.826 --> 15:48.763
You said, "Hear me out...

15:48.816 --> 15:50.988
"If you don't like what I have to
say, we'll part as friends."

15:51.013 --> 15:52.911
It turns out I don't like
what you had to say.

15:52.927 --> 15:54.028
Well, I'm afraid I lied to you.

15:54.077 --> 15:55.185
Well, then, why should
I trust you now?

15:55.185 --> 15:56.817
Because you don't have a choice.

15:58.230 --> 16:01.901
What you have is 23
hours and 59 minutes.

16:07.619 --> 16:08.619
Goodnight.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.882
AAAAH!

16:47.952 --> 16:48.992
Hello, Peter.

16:51.898 --> 16:52.898
Jesus!

16:54.015 --> 16:55.015
How?

16:58.916 --> 17:00.850
When are they going to print?

17:02.323 --> 17:03.523
Can we stop it?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.840
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

17:24.092 --> 17:26.130
Somebody leaked
the story to the press.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.856
Everything is upside fucking down.
I have lost control.

17:29.881 --> 17:33.302
I need my sounding board.
Where the fuck are you?

17:34.232 --> 17:36.365
Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!

17:37.107 --> 17:40.232
Tracy?
- Hey.

17:44.905 --> 17:45.991
Where did you go?

17:46.016 --> 17:48.835
I, uh, sorry, I had a work thing.
Listen...

17:48.914 --> 17:51.314
It doesn't matter.
We have to leave.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.054
What?

17:52.102 --> 17:53.622
Sammy was arrested.

17:55.797 --> 17:59.289
Sammy? Are you okay?
Are you sure?

17:59.749 --> 18:00.867
Okay, good, listen to me.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.304
Everything's going to be fine,
okay, I'm going to handle this.

18:03.701 --> 18:05.598
I'm going to pick you
up from Nana's later.

18:05.623 --> 18:07.195
Could you put Nana back on?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.325
I love you, too.

18:10.061 --> 18:12.154
Mom, listen up.
No, we don't need a lawyer, okay?

18:12.179 --> 18:14.242
I just need you to
go into my closet

18:14.297 --> 18:15.898
and get the shoebox
out of the right side.

18:15.898 --> 18:18.054
There's a little black
phone book inside of it.

18:18.445 --> 18:19.805
No, it was Sam's.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.540
I need you to get Rueull Abbott's
contact information and call me back.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.337
Hey! Hey! Get up.

18:31.149 --> 18:32.669
Where are we going?

18:34.164 --> 18:35.149
We gotta get out of here.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.133
In case Katerina decides you're a
more expedient path than cooperation.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.586
Where are we going to go?

18:40.984 --> 18:44.804
A friend of mine is out of town
and her kids are at her grandma's.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.796
Sounds like a fairy tale.

18:53.870 --> 18:55.390
You look like shit.

18:59.409 --> 19:00.529
You all right?

19:02.065 --> 19:03.065
Fine

19:19.397 --> 19:20.677
I need your help

19:39.571 --> 19:41.838
Sirin came to my
place that night

19:42.626 --> 19:44.711
after my polygraph test.

19:45.782 --> 19:46.727
He was hurt.

19:46.751 --> 19:50.335
I took care of him. I asked
him to leave, but he didn't.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.227
The next day, when you
came in, he was still there...

19:55.688 --> 19:56.688
Hiding

19:59.411 --> 20:02.803
I took him to the safe house
where we found him later.

20:03.340 --> 20:04.864
I lied to you.

20:05.653 --> 20:07.520
I didn't think I had any choice.

20:10.392 --> 20:13.292
It was me who met Joe
Turner at Union Station.

20:14.767 --> 20:16.595
You just missed us.

20:19.787 --> 20:22.320
You mean, when we
were at the house...

20:22.779 --> 20:24.997
You lost him deliberately.

20:28.781 --> 20:30.773
I let him get away
into the woods.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.721
Why are you telling me all this?

20:36.721 --> 20:38.087
I've got no choice.

20:38.713 --> 20:40.393
Turner's blackmailing me.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.691
He wants me to lure you into a trap.

20:45.704 --> 20:50.313
All I can do is...
ask for your mercy.

21:05.216 --> 21:08.145
Give me one reason not to
kill you here and now.

21:09.419 --> 21:10.835
What if you're still playing me...

21:10.922 --> 21:12.749
Still setting me up to get trapped.

21:13.383 --> 21:15.304
My feelings towards
you have changed.

21:19.634 --> 21:21.338
So now you think I'm stupid?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.066
On the contrary. That's
the last thing I think you are.

21:23.174 --> 21:26.828
Well then...

22:31.679 --> 22:34.019
Get up!
You're gonna be late.

22:53.481 --> 22:54.481
Hey, Reuel.

23:00.106 --> 23:03.340
I think I missed my
true calling as an artist.

23:03.699 --> 23:06.232
Hell, I think it's fucked up we're
torturing him like this.

23:06.379 --> 23:09.613
The boss wants to fuck with him,
I want to make the boss happy.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.340
That's probably what
they said at Abu Ghraib.

23:11.449 --> 23:13.129
This isn't Abu Ghraib.

23:14.121 --> 23:16.519
Not yet.
Somebody fucked up.

23:16.689 --> 23:18.517
No-one was supposed
to know about this shit.

23:19.619 --> 23:21.033
Why are you smiling like that?

24:19.657 --> 24:22.601
Hi, it's Eva Piper calling
for Senator Thrush.

24:25.149 --> 24:26.589
Eva Piper calling.

24:28.542 --> 24:29.542
I'm not here

24:35.739 --> 24:37.973
Okay, err... I understand.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.918
Can you just tell her that I'm
around whenever she has the time.

24:41.223 --> 24:42.371
It's very important.

24:43.468 --> 24:44.553
Mr Abbott's office.

24:45.405 --> 24:47.405
It's Robin Larkin
calling for him.

24:47.593 --> 24:49.843
I don't have Mr Abbott for
you right now Ms Larkin.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.680
Tell him I know he
planted the Piper story

24:53.067 --> 24:53.810
I'm sorry?

24:53.810 --> 24:55.388
There's no-one else who could have done it.

24:55.455 --> 24:58.377
Why would Mr Abbott leak a
story that makes us look bad...

24:58.377 --> 24:59.970
...and you and your
department look good.

25:00.019 --> 25:03.737
I don't know. That's the
part that fucking scares me.

25:10.168 --> 25:12.918
Morning, boss.
He's fucking dying in there, boss.

25:18.428 --> 25:20.961
You showed him the newspaper...
- Yeah.

25:23.631 --> 25:25.831
Who the fuck told
you to do that?

25:32.255 --> 25:33.255
Go!

25:56.347 --> 25:58.027
Where the fuck are you?

26:02.959 --> 26:04.019
Mr Abbott's office.

26:04.068 --> 26:06.419
It's Mae, Barbara.
Is he there?

26:06.457 --> 26:08.746
I am sorry Mrs Barber, he's not today.

26:08.785 --> 26:13.020
Tell Rueul that I got his message.
Loud and clear.

26:13.060 --> 26:15.926
Get him to call me back.
- Okay, Mrs Barber.

26:25.915 --> 26:29.118
You know, I'd be losing my
shit right now if you weren't here.

26:29.220 --> 26:29.993
Yeah?

26:31.447 --> 26:33.047
We make a good team.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.631
You know the secret to
making a great omelette?

26:49.921 --> 26:51.162
Breaking a few eggs?

26:52.487 --> 26:53.260
Low heat.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.448
Oh, shoot...

27:01.750 --> 27:02.444
Yes, Barbara?

27:02.492 --> 27:05.101
May Barber and Robin
Larkin both called.

27:05.156 --> 27:07.023
Tell them I'll call
them both back. Okay?

27:07.273 --> 27:08.226
Anything else?

27:08.257 --> 27:11.312
Mae Barber seemed to think
you were behind the paper...

27:16.932 --> 27:19.861
Is this typical behaviour for you?

27:20.706 --> 27:23.268
Taking days off, not
returning phone calls?

27:23.354 --> 27:26.408
No, and my assistant
must be very perplexed.

27:28.067 --> 27:31.200
You're a strange bird, Rueul Abbott.
- Thank you.

27:32.286 --> 27:34.907
People our age are generally
pretty set in their ways.

27:34.943 --> 27:36.196
Well, it's your fault.

27:36.485 --> 27:38.540
You made me want
to be another person.

27:39.618 --> 27:41.854
Well, it kind of scares me.
- Why?

27:41.863 --> 27:45.113
Because the person you already
are has great responsibilities...

27:45.113 --> 27:48.331
and you seem willing to put those on
hold for a woman you've only just met.

27:48.363 --> 27:50.163
She's a very special woman.

27:50.929 --> 27:53.187
I like you a lot but I'm worried

27:53.226 --> 27:57.386
that you're going to do something
that has nothing to do with me.

27:58.316 --> 28:00.800
Oh. You're worried about me.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.621
May I show you something?

28:05.497 --> 28:09.490
That is me, on the Yale divinity
course where I was recruited.

28:09.490 --> 28:10.294
Divinity?

28:10.865 --> 28:12.998
I actually wanted to be a pastor.

28:13.345 --> 28:15.479
Really?
Mmm. You sound surprised.

28:15.923 --> 28:17.775
You know, I was...

28:19.703 --> 28:22.303
I was actually a
conscientious objector.

28:23.631 --> 28:27.545
I wanted to be the next
William Sloane Coffin.

28:27.858 --> 28:29.791
But why did you join the CIA?

28:31.422 --> 28:34.461
I was inspired by the civil
rights movement - don't laugh.

28:37.067 --> 28:42.481
It sounds perverse, I know but I
could see the social change that was..

28:42.645 --> 28:46.044
..happening in America and I
wanted to bring those human rights

28:46.044 --> 28:47.724
to the rest of the world.

28:48.967 --> 28:50.647
So, here I am marching.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.352
I wore cowboy boots for about five years

28:53.878 --> 28:56.026
I wanted to be taller,
so I wore cowboy boots!

28:56.714 --> 28:58.781
I absolutely destroyed my feet.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.317
So actually I...I really like
becoming someone else.

29:05.162 --> 29:10.342
I'm reconnecting with
the person that I once was.

29:11.759 --> 29:14.782
And I thought it was
important that I show you this.

29:18.236 --> 29:19.596
Marching again...

29:22.330 --> 29:23.743
Now may I feed you?

29:24.553 --> 29:25.404
Yes...

29:33.521 --> 29:35.321
I got the bags.
- Thank you.

29:35.365 --> 29:36.365
Boys here?

29:36.561 --> 29:39.227
No, I gotta go pick them
up from my mom.

29:47.073 --> 29:48.073
Jesus!

29:51.222 --> 29:52.902
Did you know about this?

29:55.690 --> 29:56.690
Is it true?

29:57.541 --> 29:58.581
I don't know.

30:00.703 --> 30:05.468
I don't think so, but...
...I don't know.

30:08.343 --> 30:09.991
This is what you and
Joe have been doing?

30:11.375 --> 30:13.585
I can't get anything
past the spy's wife...

30:15.012 --> 30:16.692
or the spy's father...

30:18.481 --> 30:24.613
Hey...This is work and it's
a very complicated case.

30:41.387 --> 30:42.387
Hey!

30:42.909 --> 30:44.268
What are you doing here?

30:44.814 --> 30:46.823
I live here.
- You said you were out of town.

30:46.839 --> 30:48.526
Yeah, we came back early.
- Are the kids here?

30:49.225 --> 30:50.974
They're at my mom's.
What's going on?

30:52.982 --> 30:54.748
Mae, we needed somewhere to go.

30:55.886 --> 30:56.823
We?

30:56.894 --> 31:01.230
My friend is sick. He has
an infection in his leg...

31:01.230 --> 31:02.745
So take him to a hospital.

31:02.809 --> 31:04.105
He can't go to a hospital.

31:04.121 --> 31:06.496
So you brought him here?
I didn't know where else to take him.

31:06.521 --> 31:09.007
You said you were going
to be out of town. I'm sorry.

31:09.437 --> 31:11.037
He's not doing well.

31:11.343 --> 31:12.863
This must be Basil?

31:15.584 --> 31:16.584
Please...

31:24.349 --> 31:26.950
Why D'you bring him to my home?

31:46.646 --> 31:49.833
You really think you can trust this
woman to betray her own people?

31:50.896 --> 31:52.576
You don't even know her.

31:52.969 --> 31:57.671
I don't have a choice.
But neither does she.

31:59.086 --> 32:01.152
I think...I think she'll do it.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.245
And in your mind where
does this all get staged?

32:08.441 --> 32:12.246
I don't know. I don't suppose you've got a
spare safe house kicking around, do you?

32:12.653 --> 32:13.653
I might.

32:15.387 --> 32:16.387
I can help.

32:24.803 --> 32:29.029
I can't put anyone else in danger.
Gordon is a friend of mine.

32:29.238 --> 32:33.014
He's being set up and I'll do
everything I can to help him.

32:33.636 --> 32:34.636
Hey!
- Hey!

32:35.257 --> 32:39.632
I gave him an antibiotic and a
tranquilizer, so he'll be out for a while.

32:39.796 --> 32:42.494
I'll call my mom and ask her
to keep the kids again tonight.

32:43.674 --> 32:45.330
Do you want to help
me get him downstairs?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.464
Of course.

32:56.637 --> 32:57.254
Hey!

32:57.380 --> 32:59.060
I will do what you asked.

32:59.552 --> 33:01.332
Stay by the phone.
I'll be in touch.

33:09.213 --> 33:13.229
Good....time for a drink.

33:34.823 --> 33:36.510
Our good health...

33:38.643 --> 33:41.043
About that poison you gave Polina...

33:42.015 --> 33:44.282
Was it in the caviar or the vodka?

33:47.101 --> 33:48.101
The vodka.

34:19.578 --> 34:20.960
Excuse me...

34:31.342 --> 34:31.937
Hello.

34:31.962 --> 34:33.659
I know where Vasili Sirin's
going to be tomorrow.

34:33.659 --> 34:35.099
Stay by your phone

34:36.136 --> 34:38.135
There's a woman - one
of yours - who's helping.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.215
I know where.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.106
Where the fuck have you been?

34:50.130 --> 34:53.139
I told you I was going out of town
for a couple of days. I just got back.

34:53.317 --> 34:54.341
I got played.

34:54.989 --> 34:55.755
By who?

34:55.833 --> 35:00.022
Rueul. And the Russians.
And probably a bunch of other people.

35:01.054 --> 35:02.734
Phoenix is fucking gone.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.368
Probably dead.
Definitely my fault.

35:06.788 --> 35:08.350
But Abbott leaked
the story to the press...

35:08.350 --> 35:11.272
which means he wanted 
it out there, which...

35:13.842 --> 35:16.005
...means they walked right into a setup.

35:16.409 --> 35:17.609
And you let me.

35:17.636 --> 35:20.628
You're saying Abbott is concealing
evidence that proves Gordon is innocent?

35:20.675 --> 35:25.140
Right. I know that Gordon is your friend,
but right now I could really use a friend.

35:25.698 --> 35:26.818
Where are you?

35:27.870 --> 35:28.870
At my house.

35:29.498 --> 35:30.618
I'm on my way.

35:33.725 --> 35:34.935
Where the hell is he?

35:35.006 --> 35:37.717
I'm sorry, Mrs Barber. 
He's at a party until midnight.

35:37.741 --> 35:40.568
Well, call him at home. This is a personal
matter. I need to speak to him today.

35:40.608 --> 35:42.608
I really am sorry, Mrs Barber...

35:45.106 --> 35:48.990
Is everything all right?
No. Your friend's going to be okay.

35:50.091 --> 35:51.091
Thank you.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.552
We've got to get him out
of here as soon as possible.

35:52.577 --> 35:54.982
I will.
- I've got my own shit to deal with.

35:54.982 --> 35:55.982
I promise.

36:11.874 --> 36:12.914
I'm fucked...

36:13.140 --> 36:14.089
You're not fucked

36:14.136 --> 36:15.652
I am so fucking fucked

36:16.777 --> 36:19.169
You're not fucking fucked.
C'mon...

36:19.263 --> 36:22.544
Let's have a drink and tell me
everything. Start from the beginning.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.051
What I'm hearing is
a lot of speculation.

36:31.287 --> 36:36.151
We don't know that Gordon was set up
and we don't know that you were set up.

36:36.318 --> 36:38.337
You said it yourself from the start.

36:38.518 --> 36:41.619
They used Phoenix to feed me Gordon.
You were right.

36:41.768 --> 36:44.994
You said that Phoenix was paranoid.
-Yeah...

36:45.203 --> 36:47.203
Then maybe he can't
reach out right now.

36:48.422 --> 36:52.198
Look, just think. There's no
sense in us getting all spun out.

36:52.262 --> 36:55.526
Hey, we just need to relax so
that we can think clearly.

37:09.781 --> 37:07.324
Holy shit!

37:09.632 --> 37:10.250
Holy shit!

37:10.250 --> 37:13.007
It's the one thing I know
how to do in the kitchen.

37:13.101 --> 37:15.035
That's your second-best room.

37:15.124 --> 37:17.766
You know what I think?
- What do your think?

37:18.095 --> 37:20.428
I think we should go away together.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.607
Maybe if we pretend we're not
hearing whoever it is will just leave.

37:28.595 --> 37:31.395
Maybe we're being
attacked by North Korea.

37:32.830 --> 37:34.763
Don't let your eggs get cold.

37:40.353 --> 37:41.056
Drop the charges.

37:41.081 --> 37:42.747
This is a terrible time, Mae.

37:42.772 --> 37:45.459
You found out that I spoke to Senator
Thrush and you had him arrested?

37:45.484 --> 37:48.327
No, Sam was arrested because
he sent a SWAT team....

37:48.327 --> 37:50.828
I'll call Senator Thrush right now
and recant every word that I said.

37:50.828 --> 37:52.727
I'll tell her that I was lying.
I will do whatever you want.

37:52.752 --> 37:54.055
What I want is...
- He's seventeen!

37:54.055 --> 37:57.141
I would like you to leave this house
and come back tomorrow, please!

37:57.141 --> 37:59.500
Fuck you! I am not leaving until
you tell me that we have a deal.

37:59.531 --> 38:01.211
Okay, we have a deal.

38:01.672 --> 38:03.352
Swear on Melanie's soul.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.476
I swear on Melanie's soul.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.208
But I hope she's not watching.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.856
Oh, my God. 
Mae!

38:17.138 --> 38:20.841
I behaved unconscionably
to you and your family. Mae!

38:21.055 --> 38:22.575
I deeply regret it.

38:26.855 --> 38:29.964
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I...I'm so sorry...

38:29.995 --> 38:32.662
Whatever you do,
just tell me the truth.

38:38.511 --> 38:43.803
I had Mae's son arrested... because
he sent a SWAT team to my home.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.636
I could have been killed.

38:46.644 --> 38:50.229
This is, like, you had him
arrested as an act of retaliation.

38:50.316 --> 38:51.996
Retaliation against what?

38:56.027 --> 38:59.598
Well, I threatened his mother...
...to protect him.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.721
It's a very sensitive operation and
really I shouldn't be talking about this.

39:02.746 --> 39:04.566
It's classified information.

39:05.533 --> 39:07.667
But she was trying to go public.

39:07.948 --> 39:12.364
So, all the horrible shit I've
read about you online - it's all true.

39:16.942 --> 39:19.809
I've done some terrible, terrible things...

39:21.661 --> 39:22.661
But, um...

39:24.427 --> 39:26.107
I was always doing it...

39:27.466 --> 39:30.602
...in the belief that it was for
the greater good, but, um...

39:33.088 --> 39:34.608
I was wrong, and...

39:35.814 --> 39:37.494
...and knowing you has...

39:38.252 --> 39:39.372
it's...it's...

39:41.881 --> 39:43.614
...it's made me want to...

39:44.248 --> 39:47.322
...re-examine my life. I want
to go back to the person I was.

39:47.322 --> 39:49.805
I strongly suggest you do that

39:53.453 --> 39:55.983
Please...
- I really am sorry...

39:56.046 --> 39:59.382
Holly, please, please...
Holly! Holly!

40:38.121 --> 40:40.454
He hasn't touched his food all day.

40:41.757 --> 40:43.554
Look at him. He
hasn't even moved.

40:44.453 --> 40:47.218
Maybe we should call her...
- And tell her what?

40:47.718 --> 40:49.398
The prisoner is, err...

40:54.409 --> 40:59.862
You know, when I was 
in Athens, I was riding high.

41:00.737 --> 41:03.004
I could see round fucking corners.

41:04.831 --> 41:06.831
And a piano fell on my head...

41:09.664 --> 41:12.243
I'm just saying that the real
bad shit that happens here

41:12.268 --> 41:13.720
is not the shit
you're worried about.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.588
It's the shit that you could
never imagine would happen.

41:16.719 --> 41:20.695
You're not really making
me feel much better

41:22.873 --> 41:24.806
You know, what I regret is...

41:25.287 --> 41:27.818
...is wishing that you could change
something that is unchangeable.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.094
Isn't that stupid?

41:30.284 --> 41:32.084
You don't have any regrets?

41:32.120 --> 41:33.400
Whats the point?

41:34.487 --> 41:37.518
You made your choice,
now what's the next play?

41:38.037 --> 41:41.372
Why beat yourself up for
something that's already been done?

41:44.446 --> 41:45.446
Good point.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.120
That's fine, then.

41:52.604 --> 41:54.284
Don't ever leave again.

41:58.182 --> 42:02.791
Speaking of which...
I do have to go and take care of something.

42:02.994 --> 42:04.674
Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

42:07.112 --> 42:09.806
Go! Get out of here.

42:17.429 --> 42:19.296
You're a good friend, Trace.

42:24.201 --> 42:27.036
Well, you're a good friend
to be a good friend to...

42:30.842 --> 42:32.725
We'll see how this
Gordon stuff plays out.

42:32.725 --> 42:34.732
The truth always
comes out in the end.

42:34.748 --> 42:35.748
Yeah.

42:39.373 --> 42:41.173
Give Phoenix time.
- I will.

42:42.539 --> 42:45.206
She'll reach out when
she feels she can.

42:48.228 --> 42:53.071
Yeah, maybe you're right. I'm
just spinning out over nothing.

42:54.208 --> 42:56.356
Thank you.
Thanks again.

43:09.747 --> 43:10.747
You okay?

43:14.535 --> 43:16.215
I said "she", didn't I?

43:18.535 --> 43:20.215
What the fuck, Trace?

43:21.738 --> 43:24.482
Robin...
- No, come on...

44:16.103 --> 44:20.391
She saw that Laura and Mary were
still awake and she said to them...

44:20.763 --> 44:23.193
Go to sleep, girls. 
Everything's all right.

44:23.271 --> 44:25.338
Pa will be here in the morning.

44:27.148 --> 44:31.499
Then she went back to her rocking
chair and sat there rocking gently...

44:31.719 --> 44:34.070
hugging baby Carrie in her arms.

44:34.644 --> 44:37.260
In the morning, Pa was there...

44:39.527 --> 44:41.393
That's a good place to stop.

44:42.231 --> 44:44.097
Fine, baby.

44:47.187 --> 44:48.707
I love you so much.

45:39.915 --> 45:41.982
Get the epinephrine.
Go! go! go!

45:42.665 --> 45:44.743
Gordon, come on! Come on!
Breathe!

46:00.087 --> 46:01.087
Come on!

46:10.687 --> 46:12.186
Oh, fuck it!

46:25.557 --> 46:26.997
I got a safe house

46:27.987 --> 46:31.221
It's not really a safe 
house, but it'll work.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
Okay.

46:35.752 --> 46:38.259
Well, then, let's do it.
