00:23.950 --> 00:26.790
Hyah! Hyah!

01:27.550 --> 01:29.880
Dearest Belinda...

01:29.950 --> 01:33.000
Your father and I were glad to
hear you're off on your journey west...

01:33.150 --> 01:36.720
though I must confess we can't
help but worry about you.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.890
I know how difficult your life has been
since Drew's death last year...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.450
and I wish there was more
we could do to help.

01:43.530 --> 01:47.370
I hope the new start in Missouri
will be just the change you're looking for.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.200
Just remember that no matter
how far away you go...

01:51.270 --> 01:54.140
you will always be welcome
back in Anderson Corner.

01:54.210 --> 01:57.670
Your journeys can always
bring you back home.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.540
And know that you are always
in our thoughts and prayers.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.520
Please write to let us know
when you have safely arrived...

02:04.590 --> 02:06.520
and give our regards to Annie.

02:06.590 --> 02:09.220
Thank her for being able
to stay with you for a few weeks...

02:09.289 --> 02:11.920
before she goes
to her own practice.

02:11.990 --> 02:14.120
Love, Mama.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.660
Can't sleep again?

02:23.510 --> 02:25.340
Thinking about Drew?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.610
Yeah.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.610
I'm worried about
the children in Sikeston.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.670
You're an amazing doctor.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.040
And you can take care of anyone.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.350
You and I both know that's not true.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.080
I couldn't save Drew.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.720
Ho! Ho!

03:22.800 --> 03:25.790
Morning, folks.

03:25.870 --> 03:29.170
Welcome to Sikeston. Ma'am.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.340
- Here.
- Thank you.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.160
 I'm gonna talk to her
about it, see what she says.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.500
 That's a good idea.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.140
Why, it's lovely.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.150
- What is?
- Sikeston.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.150
There's nothing here.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.750
Annie, what were you expecting,
an opera house?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.960
I don't know what I pictured exactly.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.430
I certainly didn't think
it would be this...

03:55.600 --> 03:57.620
primitive.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.340
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.940
I don't know who
we're supposed to speak to, but-

04:15.020 --> 04:17.209
Mayor Evans,
I can't believe you'd put the interests...

04:17.290 --> 04:19.519
of those no-account orphans
over the good of this town.

04:19.589 --> 04:22.850
I am doing no such thing, Ray.
Thank you, Cyrus.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.890
I am trying to be fair to everyone.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.520
There's no reason to believe those
children are a danger to anybody.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.120
You tell that to my brother.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.300
The entire town is sorry
about what happened to Carl...

04:35.370 --> 04:38.810
but you can't blame his death
on the orphans.

04:38.870 --> 04:42.570
I-It could all be some
terrible coincidence.

04:54.890 --> 04:58.480
Ah, you might be, uh, looking for me.
Please, come on in.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.360
I am Maxwell Evans, town mayor.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.660
- Belinda Simpson, the new doctor.
- Welcome.

05:06.730 --> 05:10.400
Well, thank you, Cyrus.
Uh, you can go, please. Thank you.

05:10.470 --> 05:13.170
I trust you were told I was a woman.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.910
Oh, absolutely. Yes. Uh, but I was
expecting one woman and not two.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.810
Oh. This is my friend, Dr. Annie Nelson.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.510
She'll be taking over as the circuit
doctor for the Kansas Territory...

05:24.590 --> 05:26.710
but the position
doesn't open until next month.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.720
- She'll be staying with me until then.
- Oh.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.760
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mayor.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.760
It's a beautiful hotel.

05:32.830 --> 05:36.420
Thank you very much.
Welcome to Sikeston.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.300
If you'll permit me,
I'll escort you over to the clinic...

05:39.370 --> 05:43.390
and we can, uh, get you
all settled in to your new home.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.740
Thank you. And then I'd like to see
the sick children as soon as possible.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.570
Uh, yes. Of course.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.640
Right up here.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.380
Well, here we are.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.820
- This is my clinic?
- Uh, yes.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.260
We have made plans to expand it...

06:10.330 --> 06:13.320
but something always seems to
come up that needs tending to.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.370
You understand. Uh, you're gonna
want to take those inside.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.130
The living quarters are through
the clinic and up the stairs.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.300
Come right over here.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.990
When was the last time
you had a full-time doctor here?

06:37.060 --> 06:40.890
Well, Doc Ross died six months ago.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.950
We've been pretty much
on our own since then.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.120
Under these conditions?

06:45.200 --> 06:48.830
Yes. For 30 years.

06:48.900 --> 06:53.170
And I don't ever recall him complaining,
as a matter of fact.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.100
We'll fix this place up in no time.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.700
Well, given the nature of the illness
at the orphanage...

06:59.780 --> 07:02.910
I would guess that house calls
might be a necessity.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.450
The children- the sick ones-
have all taken to their bed.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.280
But it's not just the orphans anymore.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.380
In town, Carl Russell died two days ago.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.950
And John and Meredith Pine
have come down with it as well.

07:14.030 --> 07:18.560
The sickness is spreading, Doctor,
and the town is getting a little edgy.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.930
And quite frankly, so am I.

07:25.110 --> 07:28.010
Y-Your quarters
are at the top of the stairs.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.570
Well, it isn't that bad.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.630
At least there's a balcony.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.550
Do you think all frontier towns are like this?

08:21.630 --> 08:24.290
A lot of them, yes.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.360
I knew it would be a change
leaving Boston.

08:26.430 --> 08:29.060
The two of us went through three years
of medical training...

08:29.140 --> 08:31.970
at Boston University without so much
as a lick of help from the men.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.530
And without a woman in sight.

08:36.309 --> 08:38.640
You're gonna be fine.
And so am I.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.490
- Hello, Lee.
- Mayor.

08:53.390 --> 08:57.660
That's, uh, Lee Owens. He's been the smithy
here for years. Here. Step over here.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.170
Well, here we are.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.980
You aren't coming inside?

09:22.060 --> 09:26.290
No. I, uh- I have some appointments
this afternoon.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.830
Um, but I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other soon.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.630
So if there's anything that I could do
to make your stay here...

09:31.700 --> 09:34.400
in Sikeston more comfortable, you, uh-

09:34.470 --> 09:36.990
you just let me know, all right?

09:37.070 --> 09:39.700
Until then, good day.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.950
I'm sorry. We're not accepting
any visitors at this time.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.750
I'm not here to visit, Miss Clarence.

09:58.830 --> 10:02.160
My name is Belinda Simpson.
I was sent here to tend to the children.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.660
I was told we'd have a doctor...

10:04.730 --> 10:06.670
but-but I'll take a nurse.

10:06.730 --> 10:09.130
- I am a doctor.
- Sorry?

10:09.200 --> 10:12.470
I'm not a nurse.
I'm the new doctor in Sikeston.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.530
Please come in.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.470
Follow me.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.480
Pardon me.
Where are the children?

10:33.930 --> 10:37.230
Oh. I try to keep
the healthy children outside in-

10:37.300 --> 10:40.530
in the- the fresh air as much as possible.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.860
Ah.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.210
Ma'am.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.210
All I'm saying
is something's gotta be done.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.210
Evans thinks we're just gonna stand by...

10:52.280 --> 10:55.440
and let our families suffer for the deeds
of these orphans. Well, we need to show him.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.750
- We need to show him who's really in charge here.
- Ray.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.010
You're driving away all my customers.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.610
Not my fault if these people
don't want to listen to reason.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.730
Apologies, ma'am.

11:29.580 --> 11:32.810
We lost one just this week.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.280
Lost?

11:37.360 --> 11:40.820
I'm not sure what this
illness is called...

11:40.900 --> 11:43.300
Dr. Simpson...

11:43.360 --> 11:45.300
but, uh...

11:45.370 --> 11:50.240
it's unlike any kind of
influenza I've ever seen.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.400
On any day, this orphanage...

11:53.470 --> 11:56.740
is home to about 30 kids.

11:56.810 --> 11:59.510
When the sickness started...

11:59.580 --> 12:03.140
it hit five of my charges
in the first week.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.150
And at the end of the month-

12:10.590 --> 12:14.620
Three died.
I've got 10 sick.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.360
Hello, sweetie.
Dropped your doll. Here you go.

12:19.430 --> 12:24.000
- Huh?
- Thank you, Miss Clarence.

12:24.070 --> 12:28.030
I've enlisted the healthy children
to run the place...

12:28.110 --> 12:30.130
but-

12:30.210 --> 12:33.740
I'm worried that I-
I'm endangering them too.

12:33.810 --> 12:37.380
Lillian's the only one
who will work in the ward.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.280
May I?

12:39.350 --> 12:41.340
Oh, please.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.990
It's very nice of you
to help the other children.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.690
I don't need help.
It's an important job.

12:53.770 --> 12:56.740
And nobody does it as good as me.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.800
I had no intention of taking your job
away from you, Lillian.

12:59.870 --> 13:04.610
Good, 'cause we don't
trust strangers around here.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.610
Kids need someone they know
looking after them.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.890
Quite the handful.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.900
Ah, she's something.
She's tenacious...

13:23.960 --> 13:27.200
but an immense help to me.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.530
Stick your tongue out for me.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.280
And what did you say
the average recovery time was?

13:41.350 --> 13:45.220
Well, there isn't one.
Nobody's gotten any better.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.070
- You shouldn't be helping them orphans.
- Sorry?

14:06.140 --> 14:08.630
I know who you are.

14:08.710 --> 14:12.150
You're here to help us, not those no-accounts
spreading plague to half this town.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.770
I take it you're Ray Russell.
Miss Clarence warned me about you.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.870
It's me who should be
warning you, Miss Simpson.

14:16.950 --> 14:20.150
- You have no idea what you're getting involved in.
- It's Dr. Simpson.

14:20.220 --> 14:23.380
Thank you for your concern, but I can take
care of myself. And just so you know...

14:23.460 --> 14:25.480
I'm here to take care of
everyone in this town.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.790
We're the ones pay your salary,
the good God-fearing folks...

14:27.860 --> 14:29.800
who don't deserve
this plight visited upon us.

14:29.860 --> 14:32.130
No one deserves to suffer,
Mr. Russell.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.570
Not you, and certainly not
a bunch of innocent children.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.300
Those children ain't innocents.
They come from beggars, liars and thieves.

14:38.370 --> 14:42.570
You cannot blame children for the
misdeeds of their parents or your own.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.610
What are you talking about?
I ain't done nothing wrong.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.270
You want to send children
out on the prairie to die.

14:47.350 --> 14:50.410
- If you don't think that's wrong-
- He causing you a problem, ma'am?

14:50.480 --> 14:53.610
I'll ask you to stay out of this matter, Lee.
This ain't none of your concern.

14:53.690 --> 14:55.950
Ray, you got no business
bothering the doctor.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.490
She's just trying to do her job,
just like other folks.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.020
Let God help the unfortunates.
You're here to help us.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.730
- Howdy, Jasper.
- Hey. How are you?

15:03.860 --> 15:06.330
That's not very Christian
of you, is it, Ray?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.240
You have quite the welcoming
committee in Sikeston.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.840
Please, don't judge
the rest of us on Ray Russell.

15:20.910 --> 15:25.110
Oh. Where's my manners?
Lee Owens. Blacksmith.

15:25.180 --> 15:28.350
Belinda Simpson.
But I have a feeling you already know that.

15:28.420 --> 15:31.080
Well, it's a small town.
News travels fast-

15:31.160 --> 15:33.280
especially when the mayor
hires a woman doctor.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.890
- You got quite the temper, ma'am.
- I think it's unfair to attack children.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.190
You don't need to convince me.
I don't hold much with the witch hunt myself.

15:40.270 --> 15:44.360
Do you think you could point me in the right
direction to the Pines' residence, please?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.370
Well, it's a little late in the day...

15:46.440 --> 15:49.000
and I get the feeling you haven't
had a chance to settle in yet.

15:49.070 --> 15:52.480
Why don't you turn in?
I'll take you there first thing in the mornin'.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.810
Very well then. First thing tomorrow.
I'll be over at the clinic.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.850
I know the way.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.580
- Evenin', Doc.
- Thank you, Mr. Owens. You as well.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.960
Hard first day?

16:12.030 --> 16:16.160
I'm sorry. I hope you haven't been
waiting for me this whole time.

16:16.230 --> 16:19.730
I went down to the general store
to get supplies.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.430
From what I heard people saying,
I figured it'd be a while.

16:22.510 --> 16:26.070
And I thought you might be hungry,
so I saved you a plate from supper.

16:26.140 --> 16:28.140
Thank you.

16:29.150 --> 16:31.270
So, what'd you hear?

16:31.350 --> 16:33.440
Plague of God.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.510
Some sort of influenza.

16:35.590 --> 16:37.350
Annie, I think I know what it is.

16:37.420 --> 16:41.360
When I was little
in the tenements of New York...

16:41.430 --> 16:43.550
it would burn through
the houses every summer...

16:43.630 --> 16:46.830
and by July,
someone in each family was sick.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.460
More died than survived.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.460
I think it might be cholera.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.910
We'll get through this together.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.450
You know...

17:03.520 --> 17:05.680
the old Belinda would have said...

17:05.750 --> 17:08.380
that it was divine providence
that I was here to help her.

17:08.450 --> 17:11.980
That was before I knew the truth.

17:12.060 --> 17:15.050
We can pray all we want,
but no one's listening.

17:15.130 --> 17:18.790
No God saved Drew as he lay dying in bed.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.000
All we have in this world are ourselves.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.780
Start talking to the townspeople.

17:40.850 --> 17:43.950
We need to figure out where this thing
started and how it got spread.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.580
Where are you headed?

17:45.660 --> 17:48.890
I'm gonna go and give
the mayor my diagnosis...

17:48.960 --> 17:51.450
and then I've gotta go see
John and Meredith Pine.

17:55.170 --> 17:58.160
- Good luck.
- You too. We'll both need it.

18:08.110 --> 18:11.780
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mayor,
but I was told I could find you here.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.780
Well, I'm in the middle of my breakfast.

18:13.850 --> 18:17.810
If you'd like to meet me in my office
in a while, we can have a chat.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.950
I have a very busy
day ahead of me, sir...

18:20.030 --> 18:22.290
and I was hoping I
could speak to you now.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.500
All right, Doctor.
What's on your mind?

18:34.570 --> 18:37.200
It's about the sickness at the orphanage.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.010
I don't believe it's influenza, sir.
I think it's cholera.

18:40.080 --> 18:44.070
Keep your voice down.
Besides, that's not possible.

18:44.150 --> 18:46.240
I have read about this...

18:46.320 --> 18:51.450
and this disease is a disease
of poverty and the unclean.

18:51.520 --> 18:55.050
And here in town we are very proud
of our civic improvements.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.590
No one is exactly sure
how the disease is spread.

18:57.660 --> 18:59.890
That's one of the difficulties
in fighting it.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.960
Well, what about a vaccine?

19:02.030 --> 19:04.870
I've also read that they're making
strides against smallpox using vaccines.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.270
Unless we know what causes the disease,
we can't invent a vaccine.

19:08.340 --> 19:11.500
- Then how do you cure it?
- There isn't a cure.

19:11.580 --> 19:15.170
Then I suggest you find one, Doctor.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.920
"Cholera is a disease of the unclean."

19:22.990 --> 19:25.550
I wasn't aware you attended
medical school, Mayor Evans.

19:25.620 --> 19:28.020
Seems like I was right
about your temper, Doc.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.600
I'm just so frustrated, and these people-

19:32.660 --> 19:35.190
Watch yourself now.
These people are also my people.

19:35.270 --> 19:39.600
Except you don't support making poor,
defenseless orphans homeless as well.

19:39.670 --> 19:44.300
True. But it wouldn't hurt to understand why
they might want to do something like that.

19:44.380 --> 19:47.870
I don't care how frightened I was.
I would never endanger the lives of children.

19:47.950 --> 19:52.180
Maybe so. But if you understand
why they're afraid...

19:52.250 --> 19:54.480
well, that might help you
get your point across.

19:56.090 --> 19:58.920
You're probably right.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.370
Are you here to take me
to see the Pines, Mr. Owens?

20:02.380 --> 20:02.950
Yes, ma'am.

20:03.030 --> 20:07.060
Well, thank you for your kindness, Mr. Owens.
I'm finding it's a rarity in this town.

20:07.130 --> 20:09.070
Aw, give us a chance, Doc.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.470
You might find that Sikeston
can be a very welcoming town.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.810
Mrs. Pine. This is Dr. Belinda Simpson.
She's here to help.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.370
Thank you for coming.

20:26.450 --> 20:29.850
- Give my best to John, will ya?
- Will do. Thank you, Mr. Owens.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.820
Have a good day, ladies.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.590
- Are you feeling better?
- I'm sorry?

20:35.660 --> 20:39.460
I was told that you and your husband came
down with the same sickness as the children.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.190
- I'm actually quite relieved someone's recovering.
- I'm not sick at all, ma'am.

20:43.270 --> 20:46.640
It's my husband and daughter.
They fell ill almost a week ago.

21:01.790 --> 21:04.520
Ella, you said the doctor was coming.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.060
Who's this?

21:06.120 --> 21:09.320
I am the doctor, Mr. Pine.
I'm here to take care of you.

21:09.390 --> 21:13.660
I already got a woman to take care of me.
I need- I need a real doctor.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.830
Please, John. Just let Dr. Simpson
take a look at you.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.070
He's been like this for days.

21:21.140 --> 21:24.800
He can't even stand
for a few minutes at a time.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.340
Neither one of them
can keep anything down.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.160
Is it the same sickness as those orphans?

21:48.230 --> 21:51.570
I think so.
I believe it's cholera.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.570
- Cholera?
- Please. Keep it down.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.230
- I don't want to upset your husband or Meredith.
- Oh, my Lord.

21:58.540 --> 22:01.310
John and Meredith
are all I have in this world.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.370
Are they gonna die?

22:03.450 --> 22:05.040
I'm gonna do everything I can.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.020
I need you to keep cold compresses
on their foreheads...

22:08.090 --> 22:10.750
to get the fever down,
and keep them resting.

22:10.820 --> 22:12.760
And give them as much water as you can.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.830
I'll be back to check on them tomorrow.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.360
Thank you, Doctor.

22:30.280 --> 22:34.300
I don't understand.
Are you the doctor, or aren't ya?

22:34.380 --> 22:37.640
I'm a doctor,
but I'm here to help Dr. Simpson.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.910
You and your friend need to
stop asking so many questions-

22:40.990 --> 22:42.920
especially around the hotel.

22:42.990 --> 22:46.920
Sikeston's a town on the grow.
We can't afford talk like this.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.460
No. What you can't afford
is to ignore the problem.

22:49.530 --> 22:51.460
Things like this orphan sickness-

22:51.530 --> 22:55.800
I've seen them turn boomtowns
into ghost towns in a matter of months.

22:55.870 --> 22:59.600
We know what the problems is.
Now, if you'll excuse me, miss.

23:15.490 --> 23:18.220
- Stop it. We're gonna get caught.
- Okay.

23:28.430 --> 23:31.430
Looks like you could use some more help.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.130
Seems like you've got
a big enough job on your own.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.330
Don't be needing to take on other chores.

23:36.410 --> 23:39.540
Besides, making a stew for 30 kids...

23:39.610 --> 23:41.980
is a lot harder than
baking a cake for a husband.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.570
I've done my fair share of kitchen duty.

23:44.650 --> 23:48.920
Watching your servants do the work
ain't the same thing as doing it yourself.

23:48.990 --> 23:52.120
I can tell rich folks when I see 'em.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.180
Educated doesn't necessarily mean rich.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.890
Actually, you and I have a lot in common.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.950
- I grew up in an orphanage too.
- Right.

24:00.030 --> 24:02.330
It's true.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.860
Too many kids, not nearly enough food.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.370
They pay for your fancy schoolin'?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.470
I never heard of an orphan
becoming a doctor before.

24:11.540 --> 24:13.480
That's because I was lucky enough...

24:13.540 --> 24:15.980
to be adopted by a wonderful family
when I was 14.

24:16.050 --> 24:20.310
But I wouldn't be who I was today
if I hadn't grown up the way I did.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.680
We all have our sorrows.

24:29.330 --> 24:33.200
If you want to make yourself useful,
I could use some more water for the pot.

24:33.260 --> 24:36.100
The pump's in the yard.

24:36.170 --> 24:39.470
Lillian's got me doing manual labor.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.340
Spirited girl.

24:44.410 --> 24:46.070
What made her so wounded?

24:46.140 --> 24:49.670
Her father was killed on the railroad.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.910
Lillian was five years old...

24:52.980 --> 24:55.750
when her mother couldn't
take care of her anymore.

24:55.820 --> 25:01.120
She told Lillian that her father
had gotten the job just to support her-

25:01.190 --> 25:06.860
that she was the reason
for the misery in the family.

25:06.930 --> 25:09.200
Just what a child needs to hear.

25:09.270 --> 25:11.630
She doesn't
talk much about it.

25:11.700 --> 25:15.200
If you press hard, she lashes back.

25:15.270 --> 25:18.610
She's been known to have-

25:18.680 --> 25:21.040
a couple of pretty good
tantrums now and then.

25:21.110 --> 25:24.210
- And you condone that behavior?
- No. Certainly not.

25:24.280 --> 25:29.880
But try as you might to cage the lioness,
she will find a way to roar.

25:29.950 --> 25:34.450
And, uh, speaking of which...

25:34.530 --> 25:38.460
I heard about your little
run-in with Ray Russell.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.460
It was out of line.

25:40.530 --> 25:43.130
I had no right to speak to him that way.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.300
And I'd do it again.

25:47.370 --> 25:49.400
I know the town is afraid.

25:49.470 --> 25:51.740
I'm just as scared as anybody else.

25:51.810 --> 25:56.180
But I- I don't understand how they can...

25:56.250 --> 26:01.580
- use God to justify what they want to do.
- I do.

26:01.650 --> 26:05.780
When science can't explain something,
people turn to superstition...

26:05.860 --> 26:09.760
to- to comfort them,
give order to their lives.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.300
Surely you don't believe...

26:12.360 --> 26:14.630
God is a superstition.

26:14.700 --> 26:18.290
- I believe what I can see.
- But you're in the field of medicine.

26:18.370 --> 26:21.960
They've just now discovered germs.
We know the children are sick.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.130
We know a germ caused it...

26:24.210 --> 26:27.040
but we all agree that we can't see it...

26:27.110 --> 26:30.100
but we know it's there.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.420
Just as we-we...

26:35.490 --> 26:40.620
can't see God, but we can see
the effect of him in the world.

26:40.690 --> 26:43.460
It's hardly the same thing.

26:43.530 --> 26:46.050
And with microscopes,
you can see bacteria.

26:46.130 --> 26:51.300
Perhaps you haven't had
the opportunity to know God.

26:51.370 --> 26:53.360
If you read the Bible-

26:53.440 --> 26:55.370
I've read the Bible, Miss Clarence...

26:55.440 --> 26:57.670
and my family was very religious.

26:57.740 --> 27:01.840
My views were formed by my own experiences,
and they are not up for discussion.

27:01.910 --> 27:04.580
You're entitled to your beliefs, Doctor...

27:06.750 --> 27:08.980
as are the rest of us.

27:15.330 --> 27:19.420
 Dear Mama, I've been
in Sikeston for a little more than a day...

27:19.500 --> 27:23.230
and I already wonder if I've done
the right thing in coming here.

27:23.300 --> 27:27.500
I knew the town needed me,
but things are much worse than I feared.

27:27.570 --> 27:31.600
I think the disease they believed
to be influenza is actually cholera.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.170
It's a terrible situation for everyone.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.610
The disease seems to be coming
from the local orphanage...

27:36.680 --> 27:41.140
and all the townspeople want to do
is send these poor children out on the street.

27:41.220 --> 27:44.780
They're selfish. They don't care
about what happens to the kids.

27:44.860 --> 27:48.520
And everyone looks to me
as if I'm supposed to make it all better.

27:48.590 --> 27:52.720
The illness is bigger than me, and I'm afraid
they've put too much faith in me.

27:53.730 --> 27:55.670
I'm afraid I'll let them down.

27:55.730 --> 27:57.960
Especially this one little girl Lillian...

27:58.040 --> 28:00.560
who reminds me so
much of me at that age-

28:00.640 --> 28:03.840
the person I was
before you took me in.

28:03.910 --> 28:09.140
I want to help Lillian find her own way,
but I can't even find my own path.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.910
I wish I could talk
to you and Grandma.

28:12.980 --> 28:16.350
I wish I had your strength.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.340
Miss Clarence, this is my good friend Annie.
She's a doctor as well.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.310
Good. Come on, come on, come on.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.160
- That's a good trick, Lillian. Where'd you learn it?
- I don't know.

29:02.230 --> 29:06.140
People get sick around here a lot,
and nobody wants to help Miss Clarence.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.930
Just makes sense.

29:08.010 --> 29:11.910
You need to get their heads up,
else the water just runs right back out.

29:11.980 --> 29:13.970
Or they choke.

29:15.050 --> 29:17.040
There you go, Katie.

29:17.110 --> 29:18.880
Very brave, helping the sick.

29:18.950 --> 29:21.980
Weren't brave, miss.
I just like helping people.

29:22.050 --> 29:25.610
Well, see? We have a lot in common.
That's why I became a doctor- to help people.

29:31.030 --> 29:34.000
- Lillian, wait.
- What?

29:34.070 --> 29:36.530
You're not using the same cup
with all the children, are you?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.970
There's just me and Miss Clarence
in the infirmary rooms...

29:40.040 --> 29:42.340
and the rest of the kids
is busy cooking and cleaning.

29:42.410 --> 29:45.810
- You can't do that, Lillian.
- We ain't got time to wash dishes.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.140
- Do you know what a germ is?
- No.

29:48.210 --> 29:50.150
It's what makes people sick.

29:50.210 --> 29:53.310
And if you let everyone drink out of
the same cup, it spreads it around.

29:53.380 --> 29:55.380
Give me that.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.060
I've gotta find Miss Clarence.

30:02.230 --> 30:05.290
You and Belinda seem very close.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.660
Well, we've been best friends
since the first day of medical school.

30:08.730 --> 30:11.100
- Oh.
- We kind of had to be.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.160
It was two more years
before we saw another woman.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.730
Hi.

30:15.810 --> 30:18.330
Oh. Hello.

30:18.410 --> 30:21.500
Lillian said you're using the same
few dishes with all the sick children.

30:21.580 --> 30:25.710
Yes. Well, there are
so few healthy children...

30:25.780 --> 30:30.780
they- they can barely handle
the dishes we do use.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.790
That isn't acceptable, Miss Clarence.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.980
Every child must be fed
with their own dish...

30:35.060 --> 30:38.150
and those dishes need to be
cleaned every single night.

30:38.230 --> 30:40.960
And certainly not handled by
the healthy children, if you can help it.

30:41.030 --> 30:44.000
The children in the infirmary
are already sick.

30:44.070 --> 30:46.630
I didn't think it would
make any difference.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.770
By Lillian using the same cup, she's spreading
the same germs to all those children.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.800
They can't be expected to get better when
you continuously feed them the disease.

30:54.880 --> 30:59.780
I- I-I'm doing the best I can, Belinda.

30:59.850 --> 31:02.050
I'm not a doctor, so...

31:02.120 --> 31:05.210
tell me what you want me to do, and I-
I'm happy to do it.

31:05.290 --> 31:08.620
We need to rewash
every dish we can find...

31:08.690 --> 31:10.920
in the hottest water we can stand.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.930
I'll boil some water.

31:15.630 --> 31:17.620
Oh!

31:20.670 --> 31:22.640
You needn't yell at her, Belinda.

31:22.710 --> 31:27.140
And Mrs. Clarence didn't go to medical school.
She doesn't know these things.

31:27.210 --> 31:30.240
- That's why we're here.
- I'll apologize to her later.

31:30.310 --> 31:34.340
Well, we have a restaurant's
worth of dishes to do.

32:09.550 --> 32:11.780
Need some help with that pail?

32:11.850 --> 32:15.410
I've done my fair share of chores.
I think I can manage on my own.

32:15.490 --> 32:17.420
I'm sure you can.

32:17.490 --> 32:19.820
But just because you can manage
doesn't mean you ought to.

32:19.890 --> 32:23.450
You only have yourself to rely on, Mr. Owens.
Best not to forget that.

32:26.870 --> 32:29.170
I thought I was the only one
who made house calls.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.330
Miss Clarence is having some
trouble with her gutters.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.240
Thought I'd stop by and take a look.

32:33.310 --> 32:36.570
You know, I'll just be up there
for another half hour.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.740
After that, I'd love your company
for lunch, if you're free.

32:39.810 --> 32:43.510
Uh, I don't even know you.

32:43.580 --> 32:47.210
Well, lunch could go
a long way to remedy that.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.280
Mr. Owens...

32:50.590 --> 32:52.790
I thank you for your invitation...

32:52.860 --> 32:54.790
but I'm afraid I'm much too busy.

32:54.860 --> 32:57.990
I'll be using my lunch break
to do research at the clinic.

32:58.070 --> 33:01.090
Well, seems like the children
are in good hands.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.930
Another time then?

33:16.150 --> 33:18.180
Sorry I made you sick, Katie.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.080
I swear I didn't mean it.

33:20.150 --> 33:23.450
I promise Doc Belinda's doing everything
she can to make you better.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.750
I'll be right here to help her.

33:25.830 --> 33:28.730
I'll be okay, Lillian.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.730
- He's gettin' worse, isn't he?
- He's fighting, Mrs. Pine.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.500
Even the busy need to eat.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.840
You are a very persistent man, Mr. Owens.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.270
Uh, I thought I'd...
help you with your research.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.940
Oh, I can read. So-

34:22.020 --> 34:24.010
As you wish.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.310
Just, uh, tell me what you're looking for.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.480
Oh.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.550
Thank you.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.190
Why can't it be the food?

34:42.270 --> 34:44.670
Because it doesn't make sense.

34:44.739 --> 34:47.500
The orphanage doesn't grow their own food.
It comes from the farmers.

34:47.570 --> 34:50.170
The farmers sell it to the general store.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.179
The whole town buys from Gus.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.449
And they don't have a garden?

34:56.520 --> 34:59.250
Well, you've seen what Miss Clarence
has to contend with.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.290
She doesn't have time for a garden.

35:15.870 --> 35:17.840
I should get back to the shop.

35:18.940 --> 35:22.170
Oh. Thank you for your help-
and lunch.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.540
Oh, you're welcome.

35:24.610 --> 35:28.010
You know, those children are lucky to have you.
They could use a few more defenders.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.070
Well, I grew up in an orphanage,
just like them.

35:31.150 --> 35:33.710
I know what it's like to feel like
you're nobody's child.

35:33.790 --> 35:37.090
I'm sorry.
N-Nobody deserves that.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.590
No one does.

35:39.660 --> 35:42.530
Well-

36:09.490 --> 36:11.550
What's Hattie Clarence doing in town?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.920
- Make her tell us the truth, Mayor.
- Hattie Clarence...

36:13.990 --> 36:15.960
has the same rights
as anyone else in this town.

36:16.830 --> 36:19.230
 She came to me
like a responsible citizen.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.790
You're supposed to be protecting this town!

36:21.870 --> 36:24.340
 Please try to
understand. We need your help.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.270
What do you think is going on?

36:25.340 --> 36:28.540
We gotta get some answers!

36:28.610 --> 36:31.700
 Take Florence Nightingale
and her children back where they came from!

36:31.780 --> 36:34.770
People, quiet down.
Yelling doesn't solve anything.

36:34.850 --> 36:37.910
I will address your concerns
one at a time.

36:37.980 --> 36:40.450
The Malloys caught
the sickness last night.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.110
The Malloys and now Betsy Donovan.

36:42.190 --> 36:44.120
And this plague is spreading, folks.

36:44.190 --> 36:47.990
Please! My children can't be responsible.

36:48.060 --> 36:51.050
I haven't let them come near town
since this thing started.

36:51.130 --> 36:53.290
They haven't been
anywhere near you people!

36:53.370 --> 36:56.960
"You people"? Our taxes pay for
that place, Hattie. Don't you forget it.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.010
This town hasn't put
10 cents into that orphanage!

37:00.070 --> 37:02.970
You people built it
with the best of intentions...

37:03.040 --> 37:04.940
and then just left it there to rot!

37:05.010 --> 37:06.950
All right. Now don't make it
personal, Hattie.

37:07.010 --> 37:10.640
This is as personal as it gets, Mayor.
That woman is playing with our lives.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.210
Ray, you can't blame Miss Clarence
or those children for what's happening here.

37:14.290 --> 37:16.280
We don't even know
what this disease is yet.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.350
We do know.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.480
Doc Simpson says it's cholera.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.530
Ray.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.700
- You knew about this, and you didn't warn us?
- She's doing the best she can.

37:33.770 --> 37:36.210
Well, her best doesn't seem
very good, now, does it?

37:36.280 --> 37:40.270
We need a real doctor, not some uppity
spinster who wants to play pretend.

37:40.350 --> 37:42.040
Everyone, calm down.

37:42.120 --> 37:47.020
We need to give Dr. Simpson enough time
to do her job. She needs a chance.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.110
Our families are sick, Mayor.
How long are we supposed to wait?

37:50.190 --> 37:52.280
Those orphans need to be run out of town.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.290
All right. Now that's it.
That is enough.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.560
We will have a town meeting,
tomorrow night, right here, 5:00.

37:59.630 --> 38:03.070
And we will decide the fate
and future of the orphanage.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.370
You heard it. The mayor said it.
On your way then.

38:30.660 --> 38:33.500
Oh, Belinda.

38:35.340 --> 38:38.600
I know how much you miss Drew.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.120
What is it?

39:09.340 --> 39:11.500
What is it?

39:11.570 --> 39:13.840
I know why the sick
aren't getting any better.

39:15.880 --> 39:19.570
Cholera doesn't directly kill the body.
It drains it of all its fluid...

39:19.650 --> 39:22.910
and so the patient dies
from dehydration, right?

39:22.980 --> 39:25.250
 Well, that's why you've been
giving them so much water.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.850
Except for the fact that most
of it keeps coming back up.

39:28.850 --> 39:29.580
Exactly. So...

39:29.660 --> 39:33.720
we need to find a way to give the children so
much water that their bodies retain some of it.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.950
I don't understand.

39:36.030 --> 39:39.900
The hospital at Johns Hopkins
is doing an experiment-

39:39.970 --> 39:42.230
a method called intravenous therapy.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.600
Works just like taking blood,
only in reverse.

39:45.670 --> 39:48.800
You drip a fluid- usually a medication-
into the body through the veins.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.470
So by injecting it directly into the bloodstream
it's harder for the body to reject.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.750
We have no idea how to
build something like this.

39:55.820 --> 39:58.580
I'll go to the post office
and telegraph Johns Hopkins.

39:58.650 --> 40:02.780
Wait. Belinda, where are you going?
The post office doesn't open for two hours.

40:08.060 --> 40:10.830
- You got the hang of it.
- Yeah, I did.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.300
- Oh, do you want to learn ones that I know?
- Okay.

40:13.370 --> 40:16.160
I truly think this could work.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.760
Dr. William Halsted
of Johns Hopkins agrees...

40:18.840 --> 40:21.640
it could be the most effective
way to treat the sick.

40:21.710 --> 40:24.510
We don't have anything
like this in our infirmary.

40:24.580 --> 40:28.040
Well, no one does.
Not yet at least.

40:28.110 --> 40:30.280
Um, it's still fairly experimental.

40:30.350 --> 40:32.440
We'd have to build
each one of them on our own.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.450
Sounds expensive.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.290
Belinda, I-

40:37.360 --> 40:39.620
We hardly make ends meet here.

40:39.690 --> 40:41.630
You're right.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.690
I'll pay for it.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.630
What? I can't ask you to do that.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.070
You're not asking me.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.330
And my father loves his causes.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.460
He'd be more than happy to give us
anything that we needed.

40:54.540 --> 40:58.410
So let's make the list,
and let me worry about paying for it.

40:58.480 --> 41:03.680
Well, the most important element
is the rubber tubing. We can start there.

41:06.150 --> 41:09.920
If you want more tubing,
I'll have to order it from St. Louis.

41:09.990 --> 41:13.860
Would you? Oh, and I need as many bottles
as I can find. Soda bottles would be best.

41:13.930 --> 41:17.060
"Sody" bottles.

41:23.070 --> 41:25.470
- Is this all right?
- Perfect.

41:29.410 --> 41:33.570
Hey, Doc. I'd offer to help,
but I think I know what you're gonna say.

41:33.650 --> 41:35.980
You're a fast learner, Mr. Owens.

41:58.870 --> 42:01.530
She's spending too much time here.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.640
Would you mind
if I took her to the clinic with me?

42:06.710 --> 42:09.980
But if the disease
is passing person to person...

42:10.050 --> 42:12.710
should she really be out there
with the townspeople?

42:12.790 --> 42:15.880
She's not sick, and neither are we.

42:39.580 --> 42:41.570
You sure do have a lot of books.

42:41.650 --> 42:43.620
Books are very important to me.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.910
- There's nothing useful in books.
- That's not true at all.

42:46.990 --> 42:50.580
I found the idea for the intravenous
therapy in this very book.

42:50.660 --> 42:53.420
Besides, my mama taught me
that the really good ones...

42:53.490 --> 42:56.490
can take you places
you might never see otherwise.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.090
Like China or Africa or France.

43:00.170 --> 43:02.630
I thought you said
you were an orphan like me.

43:02.700 --> 43:06.930
And I told you that I was very lucky
to be adopted by my mama.

43:07.010 --> 43:10.370
- So she's not really your mother.
- Yes, she is.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.210
Family's just what you make of it.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.940
Miss Clarence is a part of your family,
just like Annie is a part of mine.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.690
C- Can I be a part of your family?

43:27.290 --> 43:29.990
- Do you ladies have the supplies ready?

43:30.060 --> 43:31.960
We should start working
on the intravenous devices.

43:32.030 --> 43:35.300
Yes, we should.

43:49.220 --> 43:52.380
Oh. Thank you, Cyrus.
Thank you very much.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.090
All right, everybody.

43:56.160 --> 44:00.420
Now, I want you to all understand
that I hear your concerns.

44:00.490 --> 44:03.330
I don't think you do, Mayor.
We're talking about our lives here.

44:03.400 --> 44:06.090
What if sending the children away
doesn't stop the disease?

44:06.170 --> 44:09.500
It can very well spread
even after the kids are gone.

44:09.570 --> 44:11.940
And then the death of innocent children
will be on your hands.

44:12.010 --> 44:14.770
All right.
The bottom line is this.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.870
Dr. Simpson is working on a new treatment.

44:16.940 --> 44:19.170
She just needs a little time
to put it into place.

44:19.250 --> 44:22.340
There's plenty here who believe the time
to put 'em out is long overdue.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.890
All right, then.
We'll put it to a vote.

44:26.950 --> 44:30.220
All those in favor of giving
Doc Simpson one week...

44:30.290 --> 44:33.350
to implement her new plan, say aye.

44:33.430 --> 44:36.220
And those who want to shut down
the orphanage permanently...

44:36.300 --> 44:38.260
will say nay.

44:38.330 --> 44:40.460
- All those in favor?
- Aye!

44:40.530 --> 44:41.970
- Aye!
- All those opposed?

44:42.040 --> 44:44.730
- Nay!
- All right. The ayes have it. Dr. Simpson...

44:44.800 --> 44:47.770
you have one week to show
some improvement in those children.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.500
And we will reconvene then
and take another vote.

44:50.580 --> 44:53.710
Until then, this meeting is dismissed.
Go on. Thank you.

44:53.780 --> 44:56.410
No loitering here.
Move along now.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.570
- How's it comin'?
- Turns out I'm not much of an inventor.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.970
Ah.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.980
Let me see what you got there.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.480
I need to fill the bottle
with liquid and then...

45:27.550 --> 45:30.070
have it drip slowly through the tube.

45:30.150 --> 45:33.810
But I can't figure out how to get
the opening narrow enough.

45:33.890 --> 45:36.580
Well, even if you manage
to get the tube attached...

45:36.660 --> 45:39.120
how are you gonna get the liquid
in once it's sealed?

45:39.190 --> 45:42.250
I hadn't even thought of that.

45:42.330 --> 45:44.190
Hmm.

45:44.260 --> 45:46.200
I may have an idea.

45:52.670 --> 45:54.660
That'll do it.

45:56.110 --> 45:58.940
It's still a little hot.
Take a minute to cool down.

45:59.010 --> 46:01.140
How did you do that?

46:01.210 --> 46:05.550
Well, it's more involved than I'm used to-
I'll give you that- but not that hard.

46:05.620 --> 46:08.990
See, now you can just...

46:09.060 --> 46:11.320
pop the cap on the bottle like this...

46:12.590 --> 46:15.360
and then refill it as you need to.

46:15.430 --> 46:17.730
And I thought I was so clever.

46:17.800 --> 46:21.260
I never would have gotten that to work.

46:21.330 --> 46:24.960
I think you're also gonna need a stand
to hold the bottle up like this.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.200
I'll see if I can work
something out this afternoon.

46:27.270 --> 46:29.970
That is so kind of you.

46:30.040 --> 46:34.570
You know, you're the only one that
calls them "children" instead of"orphans."

46:34.650 --> 46:37.340
I think you're the only one in this town
that's on their side.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.110
No, that's not true.

46:40.190 --> 46:42.480
They've got you, don't they?

46:44.420 --> 46:48.330
Besides, everyone needs
someone to fight for them.

46:48.390 --> 46:50.360
No child should have to
manage on their own.

46:50.430 --> 46:53.760
I don't think this town realized that
until you got here.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.100
I'm sorry.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.110
I need to go.

47:07.180 --> 47:09.580
Um, just bring the rest
of your supplies down...

47:09.650 --> 47:12.350
and, uh, I'll have these
finished up by tomorrow.

47:12.420 --> 47:14.750
If you ever need some...

47:14.820 --> 47:16.760
help, I- I know of someone.

47:16.820 --> 47:18.450
- You?
- Lillian.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.430
I think she could use the company
just as much as you could use the help.

47:21.490 --> 47:25.950
Sure. I'll, uh, drop by the orphanage
and pick her up this afternoon.

47:26.030 --> 47:28.360
Oh, she'll like that.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.630
Belinda's pretty smart, isn't she?

47:37.710 --> 47:41.110
She sure is. I couldn't have come up
with something like this.

47:41.180 --> 47:43.110
I would have-

47:43.180 --> 47:45.240
you know, if I had
her kind of book smarts.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.370
Doc Belinda says I'm clever.

47:49.450 --> 47:52.680
Well, I think she's right.

47:52.750 --> 47:56.120
All right.
Let's get started on the next set of tops.

47:56.190 --> 47:58.960
- I'll just go get some water.
- I'm a good worker.

47:59.030 --> 48:01.930
Doc Belinda says
I'm the only one she trusts.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.160
So, just point me in the direction of
your bucket, and I'll take it from there.

48:06.230 --> 48:08.790
You'll take it from there?
Are you sure you can handle that?

48:08.870 --> 48:10.570
Of course I'm sure.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.800
All right.
The bucket's right there.

48:18.250 --> 48:20.440
People are silly.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.850
This bucket is so small.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.720
It'll take three trips
to get enough water.

48:33.030 --> 48:36.790
I don't need any help.
I'm just fine on my own, thank you.

48:38.730 --> 48:43.030
- Ain't you from the orphanage?
- Yes. My name's Lillian.

48:43.100 --> 48:46.770
Yeah? What are you doing outside, child?

48:46.840 --> 48:49.640
I'm getting water for Mr. Owens.

48:49.710 --> 48:52.940
We've got lots of work to do
for Doc Belinda.

48:53.010 --> 48:54.880
Is that right?

48:58.490 --> 49:02.180
- Dr. Simpson let you come out here?
- Yes. It was her idea. Why?

49:02.260 --> 49:03.620
Howdy, Ray.

49:06.560 --> 49:09.790
- You all right, Lill?
- Yes, Mr. Owens.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.390
I didn't touch a hair
on that child's head, Lee.

49:12.470 --> 49:15.160
She shouldn't be out here,
and you know that.

49:17.140 --> 49:20.300
You aren't gonna go near
any of these children...

49:20.380 --> 49:23.240
or Dr. Simpson ever again.

49:23.310 --> 49:27.040
Come on, Lill.
Let's get back to work.

49:29.950 --> 49:33.980
You sure you want to be touching that
vermin, Lee? She might infect you too.

49:34.060 --> 49:36.220
For God's sake...

49:36.290 --> 49:39.420
Ray, they're children.

49:39.490 --> 49:42.090
Come on.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.220
Let's get back to work.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.250
You know, I just remembered
we're out of eggs.

50:04.320 --> 50:06.550
And we certainly can't make
breakfast tomorrow without them.

50:06.620 --> 50:08.750
Well, let's go to the general store
before it closes.

50:08.820 --> 50:10.760
I can take care of that.

50:10.830 --> 50:13.760
Why don't you go check on Lee's progress
with the intravenous devices?

50:13.830 --> 50:16.630
I'll meet you back here in a few minutes.

50:28.780 --> 50:30.770
Howdy, Doc.

50:32.050 --> 50:36.380
Lillian had a lot of fun
with you this afternoon.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.820
- Well, I enjoyed her company too.
- She couldn't stop talking about it.

50:39.890 --> 50:42.980
She speaks very highly of you too.

50:43.060 --> 50:45.930
I'm sorry I left so abruptly.

50:45.990 --> 50:49.660
Well, I know you were married,
if that's what you want to tell me.

50:49.730 --> 50:51.890
I'm sorry about your husband.

50:51.970 --> 50:55.330
I'm beginning to think Annie should have
just taken out an ad in the newspaper.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.340
It would have been faster
than telling everyone.

50:57.410 --> 51:00.740
Well, she only told me
because she knew you wouldn't.

51:00.810 --> 51:02.740
I like you a lot, Lee.

51:02.810 --> 51:04.800
I just...

51:05.850 --> 51:07.840
don't know if I'm ready.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.910
That's all right.

51:11.450 --> 51:13.440
I'm a very patient man.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.460
And you're well worth waiting for.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.420
But, uh...

51:24.500 --> 51:27.800
I don't want you to walk away from this
just 'cause you're scared.

51:29.340 --> 51:31.270
I can't lose anyone.

51:31.340 --> 51:33.470
- I'm not goin' anywhere.
- You don't know that.

51:34.980 --> 51:37.240
Look what's going on in this town.

51:37.310 --> 51:39.710
You think Carl Russell
ever even thought about cholera?

51:39.780 --> 51:44.340
You can't go through life worried about
what's around every corner.

51:44.420 --> 51:46.650
You have to let yourself have some joy.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.660
Otherwise, what's the point?

51:51.030 --> 51:52.190
Right?

51:57.330 --> 51:59.320
Well...

51:59.400 --> 52:01.390
whenever you're ready...

52:02.470 --> 52:04.670
you know where to find me.

52:04.740 --> 52:06.930
Good day, Mr. Owens.

52:11.180 --> 52:13.840
Have a good day, Doc.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.410
A letter came for you.

52:23.990 --> 52:26.760
You ready to walk home?

52:35.800 --> 52:38.240
I really am gonna miss you.

52:39.310 --> 52:41.280
My dearest Belinda...

52:41.340 --> 52:44.370
I am so sorry to hear
of your struggles in Missouri.

52:44.450 --> 52:48.210
I try not to, but I can't help
but worry for your safety.

52:48.280 --> 52:53.450
But I trust in God and truly believe that you
have been sent to help the people of Sikeston.

52:53.520 --> 52:55.460
We all have times of fear and doubt.

52:55.520 --> 52:59.190
We all wonder why we were given
such a heavy burden to carry.

52:59.260 --> 53:03.420
But know in your heart that God never
gives us more than we can handle...

53:03.500 --> 53:05.430
even when it might
seem that way.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.770
When I am afraid, it is prayer
that carries me through to happier times...

53:08.840 --> 53:12.170
and reassures me that
everything happens for a reason.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.330
You're always in our thoughts, Belinda.

53:14.410 --> 53:17.900
Stay safe, and I look forward
to hearing from you soon.

53:17.980 --> 53:19.970
Love, Mama.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.960
- Will that hurt?
- Not much at all.

54:03.990 --> 54:05.980
Will this make them better?

54:06.060 --> 54:07.620
I think so.

54:09.530 --> 54:13.430
 You should have seen it, Katie.
Bill Dobbs got chewing gum stuck in his hair.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.700
And he tried everything to get it out.

54:15.770 --> 54:20.230
Miss Clarence put so much mayonnaise
on his head, he smelled like a rotten salad.

54:22.540 --> 54:24.480
Katie.

54:24.550 --> 54:26.780
Katie, can you hear me?

54:48.800 --> 54:51.430
Katie seems worse today.

54:52.940 --> 54:57.710
Oh. She was never
a healthy child to begin with.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.740
I think that's why she and Lillian
get along so well.

55:03.820 --> 55:06.690
They're my two little outcasts.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.750
I know what that feels like.

55:10.530 --> 55:15.360
I can tell.
I think that's why you're such a-

55:16.970 --> 55:20.700
a strong, fine example for her.

55:20.770 --> 55:24.830
No. Not a wonderful example,
least of all to a 10-year-old.

55:24.910 --> 55:27.000
You're a strong woman doctor...

55:27.080 --> 55:29.640
with a good heart.

55:29.710 --> 55:33.200
The very definition of a- a fine example.

55:35.750 --> 55:38.880
Going through a tough time
doesn't make you a bad person.

55:38.950 --> 55:42.050
Those things define who we become.

55:42.120 --> 55:45.520
In the best of times,
everyone grows and prospers...

55:45.590 --> 55:47.530
but...

55:47.600 --> 55:49.960
when times...

55:50.030 --> 55:52.260
are at their worst...

55:52.330 --> 55:55.030
we find out what we have in us.

55:55.100 --> 55:58.120
You're only saying that
because of what Annie told you.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.040
Belinda, no.

55:59.110 --> 56:01.540
I see the loss...

56:01.610 --> 56:05.140
and the grief in everything
you do and say.

56:05.210 --> 56:09.210
I've worked here in the orphanage
for the last 20 years.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.270
I know the signs.

56:14.620 --> 56:16.610
Oh, God.

56:52.090 --> 56:55.890
I know Annie told you about my husband.

56:57.100 --> 56:59.830
Drew had tuberculosis.

57:01.500 --> 57:04.960
It was long and painful...

57:06.070 --> 57:08.070
and I couldn't help him.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.210
And when he died...

57:14.050 --> 57:18.640
the head nurse of the sanatorium
took me to see his body...

57:18.720 --> 57:23.160
and told me that it was God's will.

57:23.220 --> 57:26.750
And I thought...

57:26.830 --> 57:30.890
how could any God make me a doctor...

57:31.900 --> 57:35.490
if, with all my medical training-

57:38.640 --> 57:41.470
I still couldn't save my husband...

57:41.540 --> 57:43.480
my own husband?

57:43.540 --> 57:47.840
I gave up trying
to understand God's will...

57:47.920 --> 57:51.850
oh, long, long ago.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.850
Maybe we're just not meant to.

57:54.920 --> 58:00.380
So I'm just supposed to believe that
everything will work out like it should.

58:00.460 --> 58:03.020
I think maybe that's right.

58:04.200 --> 58:09.360
Otherwise, you spend
so much time worrying...

58:09.440 --> 58:12.670
that you miss all the happy times...

58:13.770 --> 58:15.710
and the people...

58:15.780 --> 58:17.840
who might have been
important to you.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.890
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

58:37.330 --> 58:39.360
Thanks.

58:43.070 --> 58:45.100
You sure you're gonna be okay without me?

58:45.170 --> 58:47.270
I'll have to be, won't I?

58:47.340 --> 58:49.400
Thank you for everything, Annie.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.410
I couldn't have done this without you.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.450
I feel the same way.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.570
I wish I wasn't saying good-bye to you.

58:56.650 --> 59:00.250
This isn't good-bye.
I'll be in Kansas before you can even miss me.

59:00.320 --> 59:02.120
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- You'd better.

59:06.860 --> 59:08.850
Ready, ma'am?

59:13.300 --> 59:15.240
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:17.140 --> 59:19.500
Giddap.

59:21.010 --> 59:24.240
- Sorry to see Annie leave.
- Me too.

59:25.880 --> 59:28.910
- But it was time for her to move on.
- Yeah.

59:28.980 --> 59:32.150
Would it be all right if I accompany you
to the town meeting tonight?

59:33.690 --> 59:36.090
Have I ever told you
you're a very persistent man?

59:36.160 --> 59:38.150
Many times, ma'am.

59:38.230 --> 59:41.750
Then I suppose your persistence
has paid off. I'd be honored.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.620
I'll miss Annie now that she's gone...

59:45.700 --> 59:47.790
but I knew she couldn't stay forever.

59:47.870 --> 59:52.360
Life changes when it wants to,
and often in the most unexpected ways.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.370
I've met a wonderful man named Lee.

59:54.440 --> 59:58.170
I just don't know yet
if I can let go of Drew...

59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.310
or how I'm even supposed to.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.250
But my heart is light in ways
it hasn't been for a long while.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.340
Thank you so much
for your love and support...

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.290
and know that I miss you,
Ra, Maddie and Jacob each day.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.290
Love, Belinda.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.640
Doc Simpson!

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.410
Please! You have to come quick.
It's John.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.560
He wouldn't wake up when I came
to check on him this morning.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.850
No.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.900
No.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.200
Oh, God.

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:55.190
No! No, please! Please!

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.420
- Lillian, it's all right. Here.
- Katie can't be dead!

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.990
I took care of her myself!

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.970
- Please! Please!
- Look, Lillian, dear, it'll be all right.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.100
- You took care of her.
- Please, Miss Clarence. Please, make her better.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:10.110
- You'll be all right, sweetheart.
- When did this happen?

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.410
- Sometime during the night.
- It's not true!

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.510
- Lillian-
- It's not true!

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.520
You'll be all right. Okay?

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.680
Lillian-
Lillian, I am so sorry.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.910
Sorry doesn't make it better!

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.020
Miss Clarence-

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:33.190
Are you okay? Okay.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:35.200
All right. All right.
All right.

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:37.430
Come here.
It's okay.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.640
I came as soon as I heard.

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:57.550
I'm failing, Lee. These people are dying,
and I can't figure it out...

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:59.650
and I don't understand why.

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.320
You're not failing.
You're doing everything you can.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.730
You came up with that contraption
to help people get back the fluid they lost.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.860
Given them all the water they can take.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.540
They haven't eaten in days...

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.540
so it's not just water they're lacking.

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:17.070
That's it. I've been replacing
the water but not the nutrients.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:21.100
You know, they used to give puppies
cow's milk if the mother died.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.570
It's not the same, right?

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.550
No, because cow's milk doesn't
have the same nutrients.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.090
So they came up with a solution
of water, sugar and salt.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.890
- And it worked?
- Mortality rate dropped by more than half.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.690
That's what I should've
been doing all along.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.560
I'm gonna go to the general store
and pick up some salt and sugar...

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:39.030
and then I'll make it at the orphanage
right at the kitchen.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.000
All right.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.160
I think that about does it.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.640
- Doctor?
- Mayor.

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:52.300
I need you to postpone the town meeting.
Just one or two days.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.370
I think I can help these people.
I just need some more time.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:59.110
- There isn't going to be a meeting, Dr. Simpson.
- What?

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.880
Four more townspeople have fallen ill.
John Pine and the orphan.

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:05.480
The town council felt
it was too dangerous...

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.290
to try and bring people together
under close quarters.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.390
That's a very good idea, Mayor.
Just give me the names of the new patients...

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.450
and I should be able
to get to everybody tonight.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.930
- I just need to start with the orphanage.
- You will do no such thing.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.600
As of tomorrow morning,
Sikeston will no longer have an orphanage.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:25.040
What?
A-Are you serious?

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.300
I most certainly am.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.400
I came here to post an eviction notice.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.970
You're gonna put those sick children
out on the street.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.350
Don't you understand, nobody's gonna
take them in. They're gonna die.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.950
Lee, I did my best!
I can't protect them anymore.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.220
Just give me two more days, Mayor.
Please. Two more days.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.660
No one but Lee or myself will be able
to go in or out of the orphanage.

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.000
- It's practically quarantined anyway.
- I'll try.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.800
I'll try again.

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:58.810
I'm afraid this situation
might already be out of my control.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.290
- You sure about the ratios?
- I think so.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.050
Just remember to put more sugar
than salt into the mixture.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:16.060
And make sure it boils completely...

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:18.250
so the crystals don't clog up
the intravenous contraptions.

01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:22.160
- All right.
- All right. I'm gonna go talk to Lillian.

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:24.630
I hate to involve such
a little girl in all of this...

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.500
but I don't think we can do without her.

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:29.510
Thanks.

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:39.150
You feeling okay, Lillian?
Do you feel sick?

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.580
No.

01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:46.250
Ain't been sick a day in my life.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.160
Katie was my only friend.

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.160
Now I got nobody.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.730
I didn't know, Doc Belinda.
I swear.

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.740
I didn't mean to hurt them.

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:04.800
What are you talking about?

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.070
You said it was making them sick-

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.670
feeding everybody with the same cup.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:12.150
It's my fault.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.150
I didn't know!

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.420
- You didn't hurt anyone.
- I did!

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:20.480
You said so.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.920
I shouldn't have said that.

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.230
I was upset, and I wasn't thinking.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.660
I didn't mean that you made anyone sick.

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.670
That's just not true.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:37.630
If it's anyone's fault, it's mine.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.840
But you work so hard, miss.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.550
Before you got here,
nobody came to help us.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.050
You tried.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.060
Miss Clarence says
sometimes that's all we can do.

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:57.290
She's right.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.230
And Miss Clarence needs us right now.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.030
She needs us to be strong...

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.190
even if we don't feel so tough.

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.530
- Can you do that?
- I can if you can.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:11.540
It's a deal.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.940
Come on.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.440
#And know #

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.390
# That hope can heal #

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.430
#And life #

01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:33.450
#Must carry on #

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:36.230
#In your face #

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.460
#Is my return to grace #

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.470
#And your smile #

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.370
#Is the light #

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.900
# That makes me strong #

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.420
#Like a child #

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.620
#If I touch #

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.260
# Then can I feel again #

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:12.040
# This hurt will find relief #

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.300
#If I love #

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:19.140
# Then can I heal again #

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:27.880
#And restore
an innocent belief #

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:31.080
#Like a child ##

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.510
- Fire!

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.510
Fire!

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.680
Oh, God. Oh, God!

01:09:06.819 --> 01:09:09.550
Get some water!

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.990
I'm gonna go get another bucket.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.090
Fire!

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.569
- What's going on?
- We need some help!

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:31.910
Come on!
Get down there!

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.420
Water!

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:52.529
Ya ought not let them orphans play with fire,
Miss Simpson. Somebody might get hurt.

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.070
Stop, Lee.
I'll handle this.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.540
All right!

01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:03.140
What in the hell were you thinking, Ray?
People could've died.

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:07.480
Yeah, a few may have died,
but it's for the good of many.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.320
Does anyone hold
with what this man did tonight?

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.220
We can't abide by this, Ray!

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.260
Well, that's just fine.

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:18.120
You go ahead and let those no-accounts
be the undoing of this town.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.260
- I'm proud of what I done.
- You have nothing to be proud of!

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:26.100
Ustes, lock this piece of trash up.
Get him out of here.

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.300
You come along now.

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:31.500
Don't test me, Ray.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.100
Just you wait. You reap what you sow, people.
You hear me?

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.280
You reap what you sow.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:02.600
How could anyone believe that that's what
God wanted them to do?

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:07.170
If you want to believe something enough...

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.840
I suppose you...
search for... justification.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.910
What Ray Russell did...

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.980
has nothing to do with God.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.990
I know.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.460
Or at least I used to know.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:29.590
I worked for this woman once
whose two children died...

01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:32.860
and she turned away from God.

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:37.130
And I remember wondering...

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:40.840
how could you not know...

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.570
that your faith would carry you
through your hardships?

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:48.980
And then when Drew died,
I waited to be carried.

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:54.010
For weeks, all night and day...

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:57.420
I waited for a sign that God was there...

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.430
and I heard nothing.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.630
And then one day,
I just stopped listening.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:08.500
Just because we don't hear
what we want to...

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.870
doesn't mean God isn't speaking.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.430
I'm trying to listen.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:19.420
I just don't understand
what I'm supposed to listen for.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.470
Talk to God.

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:25.460
And then, be silent.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.290
He will answer you.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.590
Sleep well, Miss Clarence.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.470
Ah.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.880
God, I know it's... been a long time
since we've spoken.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.910
And I've tried to do right by this town.

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:37.960
By these children.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:47.530
And I don't know
if there's any more I can do.

01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.310
These children deserve to be happy...

01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.110
healthy and loved.

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.220
Please, let this be enough...

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.880
to save them.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.450
Please, I need you.

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:35.950
Thank you.

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:45.980
Her fever broke just after dawn.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:48.960
I'm glad, Mrs. Pine.
She's not out of the woods yet.

01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:51.650
She'll need to continue treatment
for at least two weeks.

01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:53.160
Anything you say.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:56.220
And I want you eating solid food
as soon as you feel up to it.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.390
Thank you so much, Dr. Simpson.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.940
I've gotten to all the townspeople.

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:14.750
Not everyone has responded, but the worst off
will probably come around in a few days.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.410
Good. I'll take that batch up to the kids
and bottle the rest for the town.

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:24.990
Belinda.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.450
Looks like he got away from you.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.490
Uh, I know.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.190
I should be helping inside.
But it gets so stuffy in there.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.030
Well, no girl should be
cooped up inside all day.

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:07.230
Miss Clarence says that thing ain't
run well since Buchanan was in office.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.400
And if it's rusted through again...

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.410
might need Mr. Owens to fix it.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.880
Lillian, a woman is just as capable
at fixing a water pump as a man.

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:19.380
Sure, if you had a wrench.

01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:22.980
- Do you got a wrench?
- No.

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:26.390
I better go in and tell
Mr. Owens about the pump.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.690
But if you need water now,
the well is right through those trees.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.890
Come on.
I'll show you.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.480
It's just right back there.

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:49.450
Thank you.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.870
Lillian told me about the water pump.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.140
I'll get it fixed right away. You wanna
stay away from the water in this well.

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.540
- You knew it looked like this.
- The town hasn't used it in a few years.

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:28.600
Ever since we got
the water pumps up and running.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.740
How long have people
been dumping into the well?

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.720
I'm not sure.
Mayor tried to board it up a few years ago...

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:38.090
but people would just rip the planks off
and use it anyway.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.750
I've known about it for a while,
but I'm not sure when it started.

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:45.230
- Thank you.
- Where you headed?

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.960
I need to tell the mayor to stop
the town from using the water pumps.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.060
- Why?
- You want me to tell the people in town...

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.070
to stop using water.

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.770
Yes. Or at least
boil the water for two minutes.

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.040
Because the well is just not safe.

01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:03.080
I know the well isn't safe.

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:05.170
That's why we use the pumps.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.650
Except all of the water
comes from the same place.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.450
People have been dumping rotted wood
and rusted metal in it for months now...

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.990
both of which are a breeding ground
for bacteria.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:18.430
The germs spread through the water, and you
accidentally contaminated the entire system.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.020
Which is why none of the farmers
got sick.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.760
See, they're too far away
from the well to be affected.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.930
It started at the orphanage
and moved toward the town.

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:29.670
But the well is separate from the pumps.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.970
Not really.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.110
All of the town's water runs together
underground. It's just like a pond.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.050
You only have
three pumps in town, Mayor...

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.950
all of which are only
a quarter of a mile away.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.420
Once the well was contaminated,
it was just a matter of time...

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:45.120
before it spread to the groundwater.

01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:48.060
Mayor, if people continue
to drink this water...

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:50.060
people will continue to get sick.

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:53.570
- But the sickness came from the orphans.
- No.

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:56.160
It came from the water
under the orphanage.

01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:00.070
It's just like Miss Clarence said-

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:03.300
We left that place to rot,
and now we're paying for it.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.710
I had no idea this was going on.
Y-You have to understand that.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.910
There's no need to place blame.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:13.540
Doesn't matter how it happened, just as long
as we fix it and it never happens again.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.260
I will be here
for as long as you need me...

01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:29.200
so there are no excuses
getting out of bed.

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:33.800
I'm not sure- Lillian-
what she'll do with herself...

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.710
when you're not around here so much.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.440
She's become so attached to you.

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.880
Oh, we'll see each other.
It's an orphanage.

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:46.350
The splinters and hay fever alone
will keep me busy for years.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.360
You get some rest.

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.390
Ah- Ow.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.620
Oh.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:01.060
Oh, thank you, dear. Oh.

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:10.970
- I'm gonna catch you!
- You can't catch me! Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.620
You know, I was never very good at those.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.710
- They always fell apart.
- I can teach you.

01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:23.810
I'd like that.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.650
I guess you gotta get back to...

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:30.790
helping the rest of the town.

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:34.360
You make it sound
like I'm going somewhere.

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:36.800
My office is right down the street.

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:41.030
I know.
But we're only allowed out of the yard...

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:44.170
when Miss Clarence takes us
to the general store...

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.870
to get a penny candy
for somebody's birthday.

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.880
- Then I'll just have to come visit you.
- Yeah.

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:54.280
And I'll get permission for you
to come work with me at the clinic.

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:56.290
I need my best assistant after all.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.980
You don't need to do that to make me
feel better, Doc Belinda.

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.250
I know you don't need
a kid getting in your way.

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:04.820
Lillian, you're never in my way.

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.830
That's what everybody says...

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.990
but they don't mean it.

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:11.060
You don't have to feel bad about it.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.500
Really. I'm just fine here
on my own.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.020
Well, there's another option.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.250
What's that?

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:30.280
You could come live with me.

01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:35.690
- You mean it?
- I don't say things I don't mean.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.320
But you would have to
focus on your schoolwork.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.800
Education is very important to me.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:43.800
I could do it if you help me.

01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:46.200
And this wouldn't be
a temporary arrangement.

01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:51.180
I want you to be a part of my family
if you want me to be a part of yours.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.710
I love you, Doc Belinda.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.010
I'll be the best daughter
you could ever hope for.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.880
I love you too, Lillian.

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:22.600
It's so funny.
When I was adopted by my mama...

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.410
she had my room set up
almost the exact same way.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.570
Yeah. It's nice of you
to give Lillian her privacy.

01:23:27.650 --> 01:23:30.120
Every girl needs privacy.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.240
Especially when she's
never had any before.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.450
Besides, this is only temporary
until I can afford a larger home.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.660
About that-

01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:44.600
I love you, Belinda Simpson.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.980
It's not going away. I don't
care how long I have to wait.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.900
Lee-

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:51.840
I know all the reasons
you have for saying no...

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.370
but I want to marry you.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.200
- I would-
- Now, this is all new to me...

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.410
but I swear I'm gonna be
a good father to Lillian...

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.410
and husband to you.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.880
Lee-

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:08.890
I would love to marry you.

01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:14.320
And I love you too.

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.930
#And like a child #

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.470
Hmm.

01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:25.970
- Oh.
- # Who now has learned to breathe #

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.800
Do you, Lee Owens...

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.970
take Belinda Simpson
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:38.850
to love, honor and obey
all the days of your life?

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.350
I do.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.280
And do you, Belinda Simpson...

01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:46.350
take Lee Owens to be
your lawfully wedded husband...

01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:49.490
to love, honor and obey
all the days of your life?

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.330
I do.

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.060
Then by the powers vested in me
by the great state of Missouri...

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.800
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:06.710
- # This is my return to grace #
- You may kiss her now.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:08.940
Oh.

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:14.880
Yeah, you're married.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:28.030
- What a beautiful bride!

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.730
- #Can I feel again #

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.140
- # This hurt #

01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:36.830
# Will find relief #

01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:40.310
#If I love #

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:45.010
# Then can I heal again #

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:53.690
#And restore
an innocent belief #

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.220
#Like a child ##

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.230
We got a letter today.

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.890
- Who's it from?
- My mama, your grandma.

01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:04.730
I really have grandmas now?

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.170
You sure do.
You got a bargain in the family department.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.410
You got uncles and cousins...

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.040
and two grandmas,
and two grandmas who are crazy about you.

01:26:14.110 --> 01:26:18.880
- How can Grandma Tyler be crazy about me?
- 'Cause I'm crazy about you.

01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:21.720
What's it say?

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.250
"Dearest Belinda...

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.850
"I wish we could've been there
for your wedding to Lee.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:28.290
"A nd the family can't wait
for your next visit...

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.520
so that we can welcome
our new son and granddaughter."

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.430
 I know there will be
many more struggles ahead-

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.970
many more wonderful adventures as well.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.500
As the Bible says,
"To everything there is a season...

01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:48.670
and a time to every purpose under heaven."
