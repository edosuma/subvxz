00:01.335 --> 00:04.038
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.072 --> 00:06.107
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.609
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.642 --> 00:11.179
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.215
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.248 --> 00:16.617
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:16.650 --> 00:18.252
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.454
And then lab-made
creatures called hybrids

00:20.488 --> 00:21.622
devastated the West Coast.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.092
(roaring)

00:24.125 --> 00:25.759
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:25.793 --> 00:29.363
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.640
But new breeds have
started to appear.

00:30.664 --> 00:31.765
(screeches)

00:31.799 --> 00:33.801
So we reassembled our team.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.503
We battle on many fronts,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:37.105 --> 00:40.241
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:40.274 --> 00:42.276
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:42.310 --> 00:43.277
to end the human race.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.513
(growling)

00:45.546 --> 00:48.782
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.252
Previously on Zoo...

00:51.285 --> 00:54.555
Clem's baby could solve
the sterility problem?

00:54.588 --> 00:55.799
ABRAHAM: I have to
inject this serum

00:55.823 --> 00:56.790
into that tank now!

00:56.824 --> 00:58.092
I don't trust you!

00:58.126 --> 01:00.394
JACKSON: Sam! (grunting)

01:00.428 --> 01:02.330
You have the bio-drive switch.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.664
Why don't you just use it?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.299
Because I don't need
Mitch right now.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.467
I need Mr. Duncan.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.369
You're going to kill Abigail.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.205
LOGAN: The eggs release toxic
spores when they're disturbed.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.317
But keep a close eye on your
toxin meters just to be safe.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.408
Green is good.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.677
Red... you're probably dead.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.248
A beacon was just
activated in Japan.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.383
I think this might be the cause,

01:22.416 --> 01:25.253
like a dead man's switch.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.420
Dariela,

01:26.454 --> 01:28.189
I have the raw data,

01:28.222 --> 01:29.190
but it's dense.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
DARIELA: Upload it, quick.

(helicopter whirring)

02:47.535 --> 02:48.436
Transmission cut off.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.571
I can't reach Abe or
anyone on the plane.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.740
These beacons are waking
up thousands of hybrids.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.508
If we have any chance
of stopping them,

02:54.542 --> 02:56.377
we need the rest of
that transmission.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.912
How much of the team's intel
did we get before it cut off?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.314
90%, but it's raw code.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.658
We'll need a minute
to make sense of it.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.384
Nest activity detected in Hanoi.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.253
And we've got a power
surge in Southern China.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.987
Another beacon
must be firing up.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.389
Near Hong Kong? Affirmative.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.857
How did you know that?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.426
Some of this code converts
to GPS coordinates.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.428
It's the beacon locations.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.829
Time to scramble teams.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.531
Let's get those
locations loaded.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.875
Sir, even if we know
where the beacons are,

03:18.899 --> 03:19.943
we don't know how
to turn them off.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.670
Then get back on the horn
with your former team

03:22.703 --> 03:24.438
and figure it out.

Jackson, can you hear me?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.858
Can you hear me?

03:44.892 --> 03:47.661
I'm gonna go get help.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.234
Abe?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.672
Oh, my God.

Multiple injuries.
Please send an ambulance immediately.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.275
Anyone? Hello?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.417
Clementine? It worked.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.720
The baby is okay?

04:48.489 --> 04:51.024
Sam, what are you doing here
and why are you locked up?

04:51.058 --> 04:53.093
I heard gunshots. Are you okay?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.529
No!

04:55.563 --> 04:56.964
I need your help.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.068
Scramble blue team to Tokyo

05:01.101 --> 05:02.646
and prepare gold team
to deploy to Adelaide.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.405
Copy that. Right away.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.340
Please tell me you
have good news.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.441
Not exactly.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.777
I've created an algorithm
using the newest of beacons,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.912
the hybrid egg hatch
rate observed in Seoul

05:11.945 --> 05:14.515
and the known nest list to
come up with a timetable

05:14.548 --> 05:16.650
for the nest threshold.
Nest threshold?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.528
The point at which the
number of hybrids worldwide

05:18.552 --> 05:20.521
permanently overwhelms
coalition defenses.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.790
How much time do we have?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.764
31 hours and 17 minutes.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.533
Give or take seven minutes.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.901
Welcome back.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.503
Have you heard from
anyone on the plane?

05:35.536 --> 05:36.637
No, I just got the update.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.407
Why was their transmission cut off?
Wind's changing.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.917
Spores spreading south
from the Seoul nest.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.543
Mandatory evacuations in place.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.678
That's headed right
to the airport.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.855
They need to get in the air now.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.114
No, it's too late for that.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.987
(sirens wailing)

05:56.590 --> 05:58.091
Abigail.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.762
Abigail did this.

Dariela.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.601
Clem? Is that you?

06:07.635 --> 06:08.678
Abigail was here.
She attacked everyone.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.937
Paramedics just got here.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.572
I'll let them in.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.741
DARIELA: Clementine,
do not open the door.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.175
The air outside is contaminated.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.610
Do not open the door.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.751
Sam, no!

06:23.784 --> 06:24.885
What?

06:27.888 --> 06:31.391
We cannot, under any
circumstances, open that door.

♪

06:39.633 --> 06:41.469
SAM: Okay,
I brought the others to the lab,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.971
pressurized the cabin,
shut down the main power.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.639
But I still don't understand,

06:45.673 --> 06:47.475
why don't we just
get in the air?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.653
Powering the main engine pulls
too much air into the plane.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.045
We need to wait until we get
the all-clear from Dariela.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.482
She's sending a team in now
to deal with the spores.

Until then,
it's just you and me.

This tank healed my
father once and our baby.

There's no way we're squeezing
them all into this tank.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.761
I know.
That's why we've got to bring

07:07.795 --> 07:10.030
the tank to them.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.503
Get these canisters up here.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.737
What are they?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.506
Concentrated tank serum.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.740
Mix a 50/50 solution.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
It'll cause a
biochemical reaction

07:22.075 --> 07:24.044
that'll speed up
the healing process.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.879
How do you know all this?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.715
Before I went into the tank,

07:27.748 --> 07:31.785
Jackson and I took it
apart to see how it worked.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.921
(grunts)

07:33.954 --> 07:36.123
Once the serum is
hyperoxygenated,

07:36.156 --> 07:38.025
it'll cause cell repair,

07:38.058 --> 07:41.161
but first they need
to breathe it in.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.930
We need to fill these
with the solution.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
It needs to make it all
the way to their lungs.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.934
This has to go into their lungs?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.268
They'll drown.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.903
That's the idea.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.954
This won't heal them completely,
but it should get them

07:57.978 --> 07:59.212
back on their feet.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.114
Are you sure about this?

CLEMENTINE: Easy, easy.

You help her with this?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.949
How?
You left me locked in a cage.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.685
He's working with Abigail, Clem.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.754
She's brainwashed him.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.922
It's not true.

MITCH: Clem.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.359
You're out of the tank.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.729
Are you full-term?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.096
How long was I out?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.974
He gave her something to
speed up her pregnancy.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.168
You sped up her pregnancy?
H-How?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.971
Yes, with the hybrid
growth factors.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.306
You put hybrid goo
in my daughter?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.108
Was that not worth
a little chat?

09:35.142 --> 09:36.710
And...

09:36.744 --> 09:38.078
who are you?
Who's-who's this guy?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.747
ABRAHAM: He's the baby's father.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.824
How could you not remember
that, Mitch?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.683
JAMIE: 'Cause Mitch
never met Sam.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.653
He was Duncan.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.646
You turned off the bio-drive
back at the compound.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.390
JAMIE: He was Duncan

09:50.423 --> 09:52.760
until right before
Abigail attacked us.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.228
So, you had a chance
to switch me back

09:55.262 --> 09:56.997
and you didn't?

09:57.030 --> 09:58.341
Is that why Abigail
was resurrected?

09:58.365 --> 10:01.001
Did Mr. Duncan do
something to her?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.703
Why would you do that?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.772
To kill Abigail.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.374
You weren't gonna do it.
You weren't gonna do it.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.010
So I asked Duncan
to do it and he did.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.680
Or... or I thought that he did.

10:12.713 --> 10:16.183
Okay. I've heard enough.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.651
Clem, come on, let's go.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.319
We got to get you
to a real doctor.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.353
You...

10:20.387 --> 10:23.356
can't even look at you.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.158
We can't leave.
We're in quarantine,

10:25.192 --> 10:27.294
surrounded by hybrid spores.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.697
I turned the power off
and pressurized the plane,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
but we have to wait until
Dariela sends a team

10:31.765 --> 10:33.066
to deal with them.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.035
W-W-Wait a second.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.137
You-you pressurized
th-the plane,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.707
and turned the power off?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.341
How long till Dariela's
team gets here?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.876
Five hours or so.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.153
They're sending a
plane from the States.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.079
Oh. MITCH: Oh.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.081
What, "oh"? What else is wrong?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.017
If we don't have power,

10:50.050 --> 10:52.285
the plane will never stay
pressurized that long.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.888
Air will enter through the
overboard exhaust valve.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.923
How long do we have?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.057
Two hours.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.358
Three, tops.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.094
So we're two hours short.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.398
(exhales)

11:05.432 --> 11:08.001
Well, that's just perfect.

11:17.945 --> 11:21.081
Ah. The baby seems to be
in the correct position.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.117
But you're only two
centimeters dilated.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.126
Uh, where-where do you think
you're going? Oh, no...

11:29.957 --> 11:32.001
I haven't had a chance to
read any of those baby books.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.128
But I have seen every
episode of Real Med New York,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.497
so I know that two centimeters

11:37.530 --> 11:40.033
means I've got at least
two commercial breaks

11:40.067 --> 11:41.769
till I'm having this baby.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.171
We are not basing your birth
plan on a reality TV show.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.448
Wait a minute,
she's probably right.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.174
We have bigger problems.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.177
Namely, the spores trying to
slink their way onto this plane.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.280
I've got to to stop them,
and you've got to stop bleeding.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.982
I'll help Clem.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.760
Oh, I think you've been
quite enough help already.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.985
ABRAHAM: Yeah, she's right.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.887
Somebody should
take a look at that.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.056
I'll go check on the hybrid
samples that Jackson brou...

12:03.090 --> 12:04.124
(gasping)

12:04.157 --> 12:05.292
MITCH: Whoa. MAX: Abraham.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.459
(coughing)

12:06.493 --> 12:07.995
Are you okay?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.329
MAX: Okay.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.463
MITCH: Easy, easy.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.507
MAX: We got a problem here.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.066
CLEMENTINE: What is it?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
Looks like a
sucking chest wound.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.513
We don't have any more of
that tank juice left, do we?

12:17.537 --> 12:19.072
No, we used it all.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.507
We'll do this the
old-fashioned way.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.175
We'll find a way to
hold the spores off.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.812
Okay. Okay. Easy does it.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.146
Okay, go ahead.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.086
We need something to reinforce
the overboard exhaust valve.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.521
Part air filter, part shield.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.899
The HVAC system might
have something that can...

12:35.923 --> 12:36.957
SAM: Clem, stop.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.926
Slow down.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.060
You heard what Max said.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.261
Yeah, that we have two hours,

12:41.294 --> 12:42.462
not two seconds.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.031
You need to breathe
for a minute.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.368
What was Jackson talking about?

12:48.401 --> 12:49.769
How do you know Abigail?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.940
Abigail is a friend.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.208
I grew up with her.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.376
On Pangaea.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.278
You're a Shepherd?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.313
My parents were Shepherds.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.315
I-I never bought in.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.093
After I left the island,
Abigail's the only person

13:04.117 --> 13:05.585
I kept in touch with.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.296
She's how I found out
that you and the baby

13:07.320 --> 13:08.455
were in trouble.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.090
Abigail's bad news.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.358
That's one side of the story.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.393
That's the only
side of the story.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.831
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were a Shepherd.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.067
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were pregnant.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.102
What we had in Boulder was real.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.471
And then you just
left, without a word.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
Maybe something told me
I couldn't trust you.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.342
Because I didn't tell
you where I grew up?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.845
Clementine, you can trust me.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.847
I'm going to be here for
you, for this baby.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.391
Neither of us are gonna
be there for this baby

13:35.415 --> 13:36.917
if we don't fix this plane.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.585
It's all that matters now.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.320
He is all that matters now.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.389
To us and the world.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.524
I'm fine.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.995
(sighs)

13:51.531 --> 13:54.334
The exhaust valve is back here.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.070
The plane is still pressurized,
but as we lose pressure,

13:57.104 --> 13:58.238
the spore-infected air

13:58.271 --> 13:59.406
will be able to get in.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.142
Hey, are you sure
you want to do that?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.445
If it was compromised,
we'd be dead already.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.613
Okay.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.315
So what are you gonna do,

14:08.348 --> 14:10.183
just wait down here
until it turns red?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.152
No.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.286
You are.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.454
(grunts): Hey.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.423
Jackson, what the hell?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.625
If it gets close to red,

14:18.658 --> 14:20.427
let us know.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.030
So w-what,
I'm-I'm a canary in a coalmine?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.098
I don't trust you, Jamie.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.176
I didn't trust you when I
got on this plane in Mexico,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.936
and nothing I have seen
has changed my mind.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.172
And this, leaving Mitch
as Duncan to kill Abigail?

14:32.205 --> 14:35.175
I understand, Jackson,
but she has taken countless lives.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.344
And clearly,
she was going to kill again.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.446
She's trying to end the world.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.049
She was raised by a madman.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.984
I knew it.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.620
I knew it! All this time,
you've been trying to save her.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.460
Jackson!

14:53.493 --> 14:54.627
Damn it.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.633
(bars rattle)

15:07.440 --> 15:10.577
Jamie won't be calling
any more audibles...

15:10.610 --> 15:12.412
Hey, what's going on?

15:12.445 --> 15:13.546
You okay?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.714
MITCH: Not even remotely.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.383
Would you hold still?

15:16.416 --> 15:20.253
I can't breathe. (wheezing)

15:20.287 --> 15:22.265
Because you got a hole the size
of Jersey in your chest cavity,

15:22.289 --> 15:24.257
and every time you
squirm, it makes it worse.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.734
Your bedside manner leaves
much to be desired, son.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.960
What can I do to help?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.028
I need Steve.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.096
Who's Steve?

15:29.129 --> 15:30.730
He's, um... Steve.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.966
Oh. Uh, Jamie's scorpion.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.343
Uh, its sting is a
temporary paralytic.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.711
Yeah, it's in the cage.
Go, go grab it.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.380
How do you know the name
of Jamie's scorpion?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.306
Because my son and Jamie

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
have, uh,
very lively pillow talk.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.709
Walls are thin.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.344
Very thin.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.746
Okay, shut up. Just...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.016
You're gonna feel
a bit of a sting.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.150
Okay, on three. Ready?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.618
One...

15:52.652 --> 15:54.154
(Abraham shouts)

15:54.187 --> 15:55.322
(grunts)

15:55.355 --> 15:57.190
That a boy, Steve.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.093
MAX: Yeah.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.738
MITCH: It's about
three centimeters wide.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.431
Twice as deep.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.199
We're gonna need
a solid patch...

16:06.233 --> 16:07.734
Anybody got a credit card?

16:07.767 --> 16:10.337
I haven't seen a credit
card in over six years.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.305
Mine's maxed out,
don't get any crazy ideas.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.473
Here. Yeah.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.574
Wipe.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.975
Yeah. Go.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.211
Okay.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.747
Good-bye, frequent flier miles.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.658
Well, you shouldn't have
gotten rid of the plane.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.353
All right, looks like you
guys got things handled.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.055
I'm gonna see if I
can get any more info

16:28.088 --> 16:30.357
off this dead man's switch.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.591
There you go.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.660
Looks pretty good.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.362
Yeah.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.496
(exhales)

16:36.529 --> 16:37.630
Now to test it.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.067
Dariela said the spores

16:40.100 --> 16:41.368
seem to be water-based,

16:41.401 --> 16:44.504
with a volatile
molecular structure.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.239
Kind of like this bug spray.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.633
Why don't you let me handle the
flammable part of this test?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.545
CLEMENTINE: Okay.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.014
Good.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.687
Look out.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.097
(sighs) Not good.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.433
There we go. That should work.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.603
Although what I'd like
to do is inject him

17:16.636 --> 17:19.172
with some hybrid cooties,
see how he likes it.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.308
Well, I believe that, uh,

17:21.340 --> 17:23.443
he was trying to help
Clementine and the baby.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.579
In her special way,
Jamie was trying to help, too.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.682
Uh-huh.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.484
MAX: Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, wait.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.819
You're just gonna
leave him here?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.754
Yeah, he'll be fine.
I got to go find Clem,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.465
see if she's found a
way to make this plane

17:36.489 --> 17:37.590
any less of a death trap.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.160
MAX: Sam is with Clem.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.728
I know, I know,
you don't trust him,

17:41.761 --> 17:43.463
but I can see it in his eyes.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.465
She'll be fine. I mean... hey.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.200
Come over here,
let me take a look at you.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.668
No. No, Max, I'll be fine.

17:48.701 --> 17:49.869
Yeah, right. No, come here.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.638
Lay down here.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.349
Now, you're not gonna
be any good to anybody,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.108
you drop dead.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.344
Tank's healing only goes so far.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.711
(grunts)

18:02.749 --> 18:04.717
(quietly): Oh, Mitch.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.753
MITCH: That's not comforting.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.157
What?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.391
Gunshot wound is fine.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.593
Went through and through.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.463
The other scars.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.598
Oh, yeah. Those.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.300
Those are nothing.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.736
It's these scars
that bother you?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.572
Max.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.183
You glommed onto the
team for a few days,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.484
now you think I'm
gonna let you turn this

18:28.508 --> 18:29.742
into a family therapy session?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.478
Come on, just-just glue me up.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.712
Leave me alone.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.217
You know what?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.886
I think I have, uh,

18:39.919 --> 18:41.754
glommed on at just
about the right time.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.223
Huh?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.158
Free of the bio-drive device,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.503
family's about to add another
branch to ye old family tree.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.196
Max?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.298
I'm begging you: don't do
what you're about to do.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.334
Just humor me.
I'm about to be a great-grandfather.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.305
You know, there's, uh...

18:58.338 --> 19:01.508
nothing like the
feeling of hope you get

19:01.541 --> 19:04.677
when you have a new
baby in your arms.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.246
For one tiny moment,

19:06.279 --> 19:07.914
everything is right
with the world.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.516
Trust me.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.519
You're not gonna want
to be alone then.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.796
You're gonna want
to share that moment

19:13.820 --> 19:15.522
with the people that you love.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.558
Okay, I think I'm gonna puke.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.593
(grunting)

19:22.562 --> 19:24.797
It's gonna take a whole
lot more than a new baby

19:24.831 --> 19:26.366
to make everything
right in the world.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.902
You'll see.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.881
(footsteps approaching)

19:53.593 --> 19:56.229
Look, I know I messed up.

19:56.263 --> 20:01.501
I know that what I did to you...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.836
it was horrible.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.439
And I'm sorry.

20:06.473 --> 20:10.610
And I thought it was the
only way to get Abigail.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.214
But you have every
right to be mad.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.487
You think I'm mad at you?

20:22.522 --> 20:28.328
You think I'm mad that
your pathological obsession

20:28.361 --> 20:30.863
almost got us all killed?

20:30.897 --> 20:34.601
Almost got Clem killed?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.002
I never meant for
that to happen.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.270
I don't care!

20:38.405 --> 20:40.507
I don't care what you meant.

20:42.642 --> 20:47.414
I'm not mad at you.

20:47.447 --> 20:51.684
Because I'm not anything at
you, anymore.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.821
Do you know what it
was like in that tank?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.524

tear out my throat.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.700
yeah. You've been
saying all along how

31:41.733 --> 31:44.236
maybe you're not that different
from your father and sister.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.373
What if it's time you put
that to your advantage?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.375
Don't look at the
code as Jackson.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.644
Try looking at it like an Oz.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.513
Your sister learned a
lot from your father.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.515
You've learned a lot from
him, too.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.050
Follow those ants.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.319
TESSA: I'm putting
you on speaker.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.988
(comm beeps)

32:02.021 --> 32:04.056
JACKSON: My dad used to
tell these terrible jokes

32:04.090 --> 32:06.158
when he was working,
and there was this one

32:06.192 --> 32:07.593
(laughs): that he used to say.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.662
What did the aardvark
say to the taxi driver?

32:10.696 --> 32:12.398
Follow... those ants.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.366
I think I just found a way

32:14.400 --> 32:16.335
to Abigail's beacon
operating system.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.670
Can you reprogram them,
or shut them down?

32:18.704 --> 32:21.974
I'm not sure that this computer
can handle this software.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.142
What's happening?

32:23.175 --> 32:24.977
Hey. Whoa.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.146
Whoa. (screen crackling)

32:30.016 --> 32:32.251
Okay, the dead man's switch is
okay, but...

32:32.284 --> 32:34.586
this software is insane.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.423
We-we need a much
larger processor.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.158
We need a-a-a...

32:39.191 --> 32:40.226
a bigger computer.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.561
The IADG has a super-processor
that should work.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.172
Jackson, you need to get
that dead man's switch

32:44.196 --> 32:45.097
here to command.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.608
LOGAN: Our team will
be there in an hour

32:46.632 --> 32:48.234
to neutralize the spores.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.101
We don't have an hour.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.237
The spores will be
here in 15 minutes.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.111
Max, how is everyone?

32:59.145 --> 33:00.379
How's Clem?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.124
She's a Morgan.
She's, uh, stubborn as hell,

33:02.148 --> 33:03.491
but that's not
gonna count for much

33:03.515 --> 33:05.317
unless I get this
plane repressurized.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.553
Do you mind if I borrow your air horn?
Thanks.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.055
You made a filter.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.722
Yeah, hydraulic fluid.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.192
The oil's gonna trap the
spores, and let the air through.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.461
And Mitch figured it out, but...

33:15.494 --> 33:16.695
I need to find out

33:16.728 --> 33:19.198
where the, uh,
auxiliary power unit is.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.266
The APU? Yeah.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.077
There's an access panel
in the electrical room,

33:22.101 --> 33:23.602
but you can't do that.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.205
If you change the filter,
you'll be exposed to the spores.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.482
Spores have been
diffused for hours.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.607
I-I should be fine.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.043
You don't know that.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.745
Look, you've had to make
a lot of tough decisions.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.448
They've come out
of love and pain.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.617
Mitch will realize that, too.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.652
So try not to beat
yourself up so much.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.489
Max...

33:43.522 --> 33:46.058
Look.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.526
Max...

33:47.559 --> 33:50.062
You've been good for my son.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.463
Take care of him for me.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.798
No, no, Max! Max!

33:52.831 --> 33:54.566
Come back.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.139
Okay, Clementine, push.
(breathing heavily)

34:00.172 --> 34:03.409

34:03.442 --> 34:06.778

(device beeps)

37:03.822 --> 37:05.924
Thank God.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.635
Come on.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.304
Get you back to mama.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.272
Hi.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.640
Thanks, Dad.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.909
Couldn't have done
it without you.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.312
Can you test him?

37:26.345 --> 37:30.416
For the CLM protein,
see if your theory works.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.718
Sure.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.885
Yeah.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.790
We're gonna see if you
can save the world.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.392
Okay?

37:40.426 --> 37:43.795
Shh...

37:43.829 --> 37:46.064
(baby cries)

37:46.097 --> 37:47.999
Good job.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.001
You're so brave.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.704
You're so brave.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.409
It's a boy.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.911
He's perfect.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.984
Where's Grandpa?

38:08.454 --> 38:09.988
Uh...

38:10.021 --> 38:13.425
he should be back by now.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.594
I'll go look for him.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.436
MITCH: Max?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.105
Max?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.340
Hey.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.409
Max? Hmm?

38:30.442 --> 38:31.577
Huh? (gasps)

38:31.610 --> 38:34.346
You okay? Hey.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.448
Hey.

38:36.482 --> 38:39.618
Your idea worked.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.022
Yeah.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.025
Well,
only because you made it work.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.760
What do you know.

38:50.762 --> 38:55.434
Finally figured a way
to work together. Huh?

38:55.467 --> 38:56.768
(swallows hard)

38:56.802 --> 39:02.040
I heard the baby.
I heard the baby.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.411
Yep. He's here.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.414
You tell him I said hello.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.016
No.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.051
You're gonna tell him yourself.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.720
Come on.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.054
(Max groans) Easy.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.023
Okay.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.667
Spores are down.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.670
All clear. That's your window.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.105
Time to save the world, genius.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.712
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.895
(baby cries)

40:01.733 --> 40:03.969
Say hello to your
great-grandson.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.406
(baby coos)

40:10.809 --> 40:13.912
(baby coos)

40:19.585 --> 40:20.752
Yeah.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.824
(baby cries softly)

40:41.940 --> 40:44.510
(Mitch cries)

40:54.920 --> 40:56.722
(baby cries)

41:26.151 --> 41:30.188
Um, Clem had the baby.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.593
And he's...

41:34.626 --> 41:36.562
he's beautiful.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.296
And healthy and, uh...

41:38.329 --> 41:41.066
perfect.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.506
And in a few hours,
he's gonna save the whole world.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.548
So everybody's okay?

41:58.617 --> 42:02.520
Yeah. Um, Clem's fine.
She's doing great.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.025
And Max,
he got the power back on.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.964
Everybody's fine.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.176
The baby really is beautiful.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.781
I'm sorry.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.719
I'm... I'm sorry.
