WEBVTT

00:09.951 --> 00:11.088
Are your eyes closed?

00:11.088 --> 00:12.738
What is it?

00:12.738 --> 00:16.654
It's something my antiques scout found for me.

00:16.654 --> 00:19.192
Voila! Paris, 1882!

00:19.192 --> 00:22.615
Designed by Jean-Francois Blon,
while attending L'Ecole des Beaux Arts!

00:22.615 --> 00:30.003
Mon Dieu! It's absolutely breathtaking!

00:30.003 --> 00:35.278
I'm breathless!

00:35.278 --> 00:39.319
I need to take a breath.

00:39.319 --> 00:42.495
Evening, Dr. Crane.

00:42.495 --> 00:43.693
Would you like to try a game, Niles?

00:43.693 --> 00:46.231
Oh, I think not.  It'll make me too melancholy.

00:46.231 --> 00:46.919
Well, all right.

00:46.919 --> 00:50.039
Maris and I used to play chess
every Thursday night.

00:50.039 --> 00:51.637
Oh, how she loved the game.

00:51.637 --> 00:57.981
No wonder ?the king is stationary
while the queen has all the power.

00:57.981 --> 00:59.728
How are you getting along, Dr. Crane?

00:59.728 --> 01:01.398
Oh, all right, I guess.

01:01.398 --> 01:03.212
Feeling a bit lonely, are we?

01:03.212 --> 01:09.869
Only some times when I'm by myself,
or other times when I'm with other people.

01:09.869 --> 01:12.900
It may not be my place to suggest this,
but perhaps all you need is

01:12.900 --> 01:17.054
a little company at the apartment
something warm and friendly to come home?

01:17.054 --> 01:18.813
Well, I'm sure Dad would miss you.

01:18.813 --> 01:22.470
Oh, Dr. Crane!

01:22.470 --> 01:26.685
Oh, me!

01:26.685 --> 01:28.767
I'm talking about a dog.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.107
They're wonderful companions.

01:30.107 --> 01:34.516
Just look at how much Eddie's brought
to your father's life.

01:34.516 --> 01:36.789
Oh, there's nothing like a dog's
unconditional love.

01:36.789 --> 01:39.661
Seeing  that smiling face greet you at the door.

01:39.661 --> 01:44.213
It's one of the most rewarding
relationships a person can have.

01:44.213 --> 01:51.491
Again?  If you're going to drink
out of the toilet, you can at least learn to use it.

01:51.491 --> 01:53.053
Would you like to come with me?

01:53.053 --> 01:56.356
Maybe get the feel of the leash?

01:56.356 --> 01:59.837
Perhaps I will.

01:59.837 --> 02:04.357
You know, Daphne, maybe you're on
to something with this dogbusiness.

02:04.357 --> 02:09.906
I'm starting to feel less lonely already.

02:12.061 --> 02:18.181
Chop, chop!  Come with us.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.165
Oh, hi, Dad.  Did you see my new chess set?

02:20.165 --> 02:21.492
Oh yeah, it's nice.

02:21.492 --> 02:24.020
"Nice?"  Well, the inlay was made
from the same Travertine marble

02:24.020 --> 02:26.501
they used at the Emperor Hadrian's
palace outside Tivoli!

02:26.501 --> 02:30.806
Really?  Well, I'm gonna celebrate
with a beverage brewed from the crystal-clear waters

02:30.806 --> 02:36.868
of the majestic Colorado Rockies!

02:36.868 --> 02:40.058
Good one, Dad.  Say, how about a game?

02:40.058 --> 02:41.301
Nah, I don't think so.

02:41.301 --> 02:43.469
Oh, come on, Dad.  You know how to play, don't you?

02:43.469 --> 02:46.987
Well, Daphne showed me once.
But really, checkers is more my speed.

02:46.987 --> 02:48.734
Oh, come on, checkers is a kid's game.

02:48.734 --> 02:49.556
Come on, Dad!

02:49.556 --> 02:53.449
I just got it!  Please?  Nobody will play with me!

02:53.449 --> 02:55.837
All right, I'll give it another shot.

02:55.837 --> 02:59.524
Those guys at the park  make it
look great eating baloney sandwiches,

02:59.524 --> 03:03.848
smoking cigars, sometimes a fist-fight
even breaks out!

03:03.848 --> 03:13.088
Well, let's just start with name-calling
and see where it goes, all right?

03:13.088 --> 03:15.028
Your turn.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.060
Now, Dad, please, you don't have to rush.

03:18.060 --> 03:22.105
As a novice, you have the right to
sit back, survey the board, take yourtime.

03:22.105 --> 03:25.586
I will not pressure you or hover like a vulture.

03:25.586 --> 03:28.314
Please, feel free to ask any questions you might have.

03:28.314 --> 03:35.450
Is this a checkmate?

03:35.450 --> 03:38.930
Yes, it is.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.313
You mean I won?

03:40.313 --> 03:42.162
Well, yes.

03:42.162 --> 03:44.731
Hey, hey!  I won!  How do you like that?

03:44.731 --> 03:46.656
Well, in all fairness, my mind was
a bit distracted by

03:46.656 --> 03:53.057
having to monitor your side of the
board, but, uh... Touche!

03:53.057 --> 03:54.033
How about another game, Dad?

03:54.033 --> 03:56.273
No, I think one'll do it for me, thanks.

03:56.273 --> 03:58.539
Well, uh, all right, fair enough.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.347
Boy, I really clobbered you though, didn't I?

04:02.347 --> 04:04.811
I got almost all of your prawns.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.487
Pawns, Dad.

04:07.487 --> 04:09.776
I think the turning point was when
I got that tower-thingy.

04:09.776 --> 04:11.546
Yes, it's called a rook.

04:11.546 --> 04:14.800
But the real knockout blow was when
I backed your little horsey-guy into the corner.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.170
Can we call it a night, Dad?

04:16.170 --> 04:17.394
O.K., when I cornered your knight.

04:17.394 --> 04:20.409
No, I mean can we call it a night?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.170
Hey, Frasier.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.304
Oh hi, Roz.

04:30.304 --> 04:34.985
Uh, one double-tall latte, a slice
of pecan pie with extra whipped cream.

04:34.985 --> 04:35.713
Anything else?

04:35.713 --> 04:39.065
Perhaps a blood-pressure cuff?

04:39.065 --> 04:40.737
I'm just a little nervous today, O.K.?

04:40.737 --> 04:42.703
Oh, really?  Trouble on the dating front?

04:42.703 --> 04:44.520
I'm not that shallow, all right?

04:44.520 --> 04:48.920
It's about my hair.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.794
I've got an appointment this afternoon with Noge.

04:51.794 --> 04:52.963
"Noge?"

04:52.963 --> 04:56.024
He's the hottest hairstylist in Seattle?

04:56.024 --> 04:57.537
"Noge?"

04:57.537 --> 04:59.354
I think he's getting a little bored with me.

04:59.354 --> 05:03.120
When he cuts my hair, I can't ever
think of anything to say!

05:03.120 --> 05:04.305
Well, how's this for an icebreaker:

05:04.305 --> 05:09.543
"Say, Noge, where'd you get such a stupid name?"

05:09.543 --> 05:11.113
You should see him with all of
his other clients.

05:11.113 --> 05:13.094
They're all laughing, having
a wonderful time.

05:13.094 --> 05:15.818
I walk in, sit down, it's death.

05:15.818 --> 05:19.617
Maybe there's something in here
that'll hold his attention.

05:19.617 --> 05:22.263
Oh, wow, here's something.

05:22.263 --> 05:26.417
A lady in Italy gave birth to
a nineteen-pound baby!

05:26.417 --> 05:27.478
Oh my God.

05:27.478 --> 05:28.087
No kidding.

05:28.087 --> 05:32.825
She's not going to be hopping on
her Vespa anytime soon.

05:32.825 --> 05:34.263
That's how he did it.

05:34.263 --> 05:35.561
What are you talking about?

05:35.561 --> 05:39.240
My father beat me at chess last night,
and I've just realized now it was sheer dumb luck.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.845
He stumbled into the Panoph-Vinick attack!

05:41.845 --> 05:42.901
Frasier, I?

05:42.901 --> 05:44.267
Oh Roz, I can't tell you what
a relief this is.

05:44.267 --> 05:47.683
My God, my whole world makes sense again.

05:47.683 --> 05:50.182
Frasier, you are forgetting about
my problem with Noge.

05:50.182 --> 05:54.262
Yes, and it'd be a lot easier
if you'd stop bringing it up.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.508
Hello, Niles.

06:02.508 --> 06:03.341
Hello, Frasier.

06:03.341 --> 06:04.598
To what do I owe this pleasure?

06:04.598 --> 06:08.206
Well, I took to heart Daphne's 
suggestion the other day about a need for companionship

06:08.206 --> 06:16.731
since my separation from Maris,
so I went out and got a new lady in my life.

06:16.731 --> 06:17.613
I can't explain it.

06:17.613 --> 06:20.483
I'm not a dog person, but there's
something about this particular breed that

06:20.483 --> 06:27.259
I find comforting and familiar.

06:27.259 --> 06:28.315
It's mystifying, isn't it?

06:28.315 --> 06:31.018
Mmm, baffling.

06:31.018 --> 06:34.068
I-I happened into my local pet shop,
and I had no intention of buying anything,

06:34.068 --> 06:37.534
I was merely browsing, and they showed
me some overly demonstrative puppies.

06:37.534 --> 06:41.061
Then I heard a haughty little sniff
from a cage in the corner,

06:41.061 --> 06:42.532
and there she was!

06:42.532 --> 06:43.933
Sit, Girl, sit!

06:43.933 --> 06:48.925
OK.

06:48.925 --> 06:52.396
She's, uh, she's a bit high strung,
but, uh, she's terribly well-bred.

06:52.396 --> 06:57.186
When I tried to pet her, she'd have none of it.

06:57.186 --> 06:59.578
Well, I'm surprised she wasn't snapped
up before you got there.

06:59.578 --> 07:02.902
Yes, well, the man at the pet store 
said it's because people are reluctant to

07:02.902 --> 07:05.860
take responsibility for her nerve medicine.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.436
No, not on the couch.

07:06.436 --> 07:07.733
Off, off!

07:07.733 --> 07:12.301
OK.

07:12.301 --> 07:12.979
Hey, Niles.

07:12.979 --> 07:15.079
Hey, Dad.

07:15.079 --> 07:18.863
What the hell is that?

07:18.863 --> 07:21.311
It's my dog, my new best friend.

07:21.311 --> 07:25.219
Yes, Niles saw her in the pet store
and had this inexplicable attraction.

07:25.219 --> 07:26.341
You can see her ribs!

07:26.341 --> 07:28.844
Hit Number One.

07:28.844 --> 07:30.819
Daphne, I owe it all to you.

07:30.819 --> 07:35.363
Oh really, Dr. Crane, I wouldn't
want you going around telling people

07:35.363 --> 07:38.862
I was responsible for that.

07:38.862 --> 07:41.693
Well, I guess we'll be toddling along.

07:41.693 --> 07:43.653
Come Girl, come!

07:43.653 --> 07:48.725
OK.

07:48.725 --> 07:51.807
The city streets play havoc with her
delicate little feet,

07:51.807 --> 07:58.693
so I have to go home and pumice her paw-pads!

07:58.693 --> 07:59.946
Am I the only one?

07:59.946 --> 08:03.037
No.

08:03.037 --> 08:05.068
Does Dr. Crane have any idea...

08:05.068 --> 08:09.590
No.

08:09.590 --> 08:14.539
So, Dad, can I, uh, interest you
in an ice-cold Ballantine?

08:14.539 --> 08:15.867
Yeah, sounds good.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.688
You know, I may even join you myself.

08:17.688 --> 08:21.383
I've got some pork rinds here and
some of that creamy Lipton onion soup dip!

08:21.383 --> 08:23.161
Oh, with the seven herbs and spices?

08:23.161 --> 08:25.105
Well, just count 'em!

08:25.105 --> 08:27.761
Hey, that's great!

08:27.761 --> 08:35.418
All my favorite stuff... you're putting me
in a home, aren't you?

08:35.418 --> 08:39.182
Oh, don't be silly!

08:39.182 --> 08:41.241
But you know, if I ever had to, don't you think

08:41.241 --> 08:45.623
it'd be nice if you knew how to play chess?

08:47.000 --> 08:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:55.863 --> 09:00.322
Dad, it's not considered a move until
my fingers have completely cleared the piece.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.120
Well, what's taking so long?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.410
I am analyzing my options.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.848
Unlike your "wing-it" approach,

09:04.848 --> 09:13.992
I like to plan a strategy, like a 
general leading his troops into battle.

09:13.992 --> 09:20.733
Checkmate, Schwartzkopf.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.512
Gosh, that's very well done.

09:22.512 --> 09:25.009
You're really getting a feel for the game, Dad.

09:25.009 --> 09:30.446
Yeah, and all this time I thought chess was hard.

09:30.446 --> 09:31.327
Well, see ya.

09:31.327 --> 09:38.527
Sit down, old man, you're not going anywhere!

09:38.527 --> 09:41.439
Mr. Crane, would you give me
a hand with these dishes?

09:41.439 --> 09:52.959
I can't, I'm playing chess with Frasier.

09:52.959 --> 09:57.470
Finally, my patience will be rewarded. 
The trap is set.

09:57.470 --> 09:59.909
I knew this moment would come!

09:59.909 --> 10:03.385
It comes every game.

10:03.385 --> 10:07.232
Checkmate.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.126
Well, that's it.

10:08.126 --> 10:09.180
Show's over, folks.

10:09.180 --> 10:09.927
Move along.

10:09.927 --> 10:11.117
Nothing more to see here.

10:11.117 --> 10:11.993
You know, Dad?

10:11.993 --> 10:13.781
No, no, I'm not playing anymore.

10:13.781 --> 10:14.999
I'm tired and I'm going to bed.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.783
O.K.

10:16.783 --> 10:21.349
Yes, I guess I've had my fill as well.

10:21.349 --> 10:25.278
Well, this has really turned out to be
quite a good idea, hasn't it, this chess thing?

10:25.278 --> 10:26.012
'Night.

10:26.012 --> 10:27.446
Awfully relaxing... oh, yes, yes,

10:27.446 --> 10:28.678
you just - you just go on ahead,

10:28.678 --> 10:33.390
I-I've got - hah! - something I've got to do...

10:45.957 --> 10:46.891
Hey, Frasier!

10:46.891 --> 10:47.939
Hi, Roz.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.643
I have great news!

10:49.643 --> 10:52.791
My appointment with Noge could not
have gone better.

10:52.791 --> 10:54.871
What is the reason behind this miraculous
transformation?

10:54.871 --> 10:58.237
Well, it occurred to me that hairstylists
love celebrity gossip.

10:58.237 --> 11:03.652
And I thought, "hey, I know a celebrity: you!"

11:03.652 --> 11:05.964
And what did you tell him about me?

11:05.964 --> 11:11.606
Well, he may have gotten the impression that you?

11:11.606 --> 11:14.461
well, you're gonna love this ?that, you know...

11:14.461 --> 11:18.446
you may have been... in the past... a woman,

11:18.446 --> 11:22.398
you're not mad at me, are you?

11:22.398 --> 11:26.724
Mad?  Why should I be mad, knowing 
the sacred code of silence

11:26.724 --> 11:30.059
all hairdressers have sworn to?

11:30.059 --> 11:32.763
All right, I'll set Noge straight.

11:32.763 --> 11:39.531
Well, if you manage that, then you
really would have a story.

11:39.531 --> 11:41.662
Well, hello.

11:41.662 --> 11:42.603
Double cappuccino, please.

11:42.603 --> 11:43.726
Yeah, same for me, please.

11:43.726 --> 11:46.084
Listen, Niles, I need to talk to you about Dad.

11:46.084 --> 11:50.596
Oh yes, how is the Bobby Fischer of
the geriatric circuit?

11:50.596 --> 11:51.589
Well, he's still beating me.

11:51.589 --> 11:56.363
I tell you, Niles, I just can't figure
it out ?I am the superior player.

11:56.363 --> 12:00.721
There's a saying: "In every boy's life,
the moment of greatest joy and

12:00.721 --> 12:04.276
greatest sorrow is when he defeats
his father for the first time."

12:04.276 --> 12:06.253
If you're suggesting that I'm afraid to beat Dad,

12:06.253 --> 12:07.899
you can just stop right there.

12:07.899 --> 12:09.868
O.K.  The other option is,
he's better than you.

12:09.868 --> 12:14.114
You were saying?

12:14.114 --> 12:16.283
Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father.

12:16.283 --> 12:17.530
It's the natural order.

12:17.530 --> 12:21.277
Yet it's frequently a stumbling
block because the son's competitive stirrings are

12:21.277 --> 12:24.579
accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.

12:24.579 --> 12:29.377
I see.  Yes, it's the classic Oedipal conflict.

12:29.377 --> 12:30.753
It seems so obvious now.

12:30.753 --> 12:32.696
I've been letting him win!

12:32.696 --> 12:34.287
Niles, thank you,thank you very much.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.616
I can't tell you what a relief this is.

12:35.616 --> 12:37.694
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

12:37.694 --> 12:38.998
Nothing can hold me back now.

12:38.998 --> 12:41.694
Tonight, I topple the king!

12:41.694 --> 12:43.350
Hear, hear.

12:43.350 --> 12:44.597
Of course, you realize by dethroning Dad,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.368
you're next in line to be dethroned
by Frederick, and then the only thing left

12:47.368 --> 12:53.266
after that is death, but that's another
day and another cup of coffee.

13:02.767 --> 13:07.447
Dad?  Dad, wake up, it's your turn.

13:07.447 --> 13:16.328
Oh, I'm sorry...Checkmate.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.477
Well, I'm going to bed.

13:17.477 --> 13:18.864
Oh, come on, Dad, just one more game!

13:18.864 --> 13:30.084
No!  I can't keep my eyes open.

14:04.422 --> 14:09.871
Playing chess again, were you?

14:09.871 --> 14:13.944
You know, Dr. Crane, when one of
my brothers would lose a soccer match,

14:13.944 --> 14:15.523
he'd be all blue and in the dumps.

14:15.523 --> 14:17.901
But I could get him to laugh.

14:17.901 --> 14:21.045
I'd make a little puppet like so.

14:21.045 --> 14:23.939
Hello, Daphne, What's shaking?

14:23.939 --> 14:25.900
Oh, hello, Freddy.

14:25.900 --> 14:29.869
My friend Dr. Crane here forgot
his happy pants!

14:29.869 --> 14:32.692
Oh, no!  What should I do?

14:32.692 --> 14:34.149
Would you sing for him?

14:34.149 --> 14:36.754
I'd love to.

14:36.754 --> 14:39.222
Who's that grouchy gus I see?

14:39.222 --> 14:41.941
You can't be grouchy, not with me!

14:41.941 --> 14:50.309
Sing along, Doc!  Who's that grouchy gus I see?

14:50.309 --> 14:54.588
Daphne, I would rather have a tarantula
lay eggs in my ear

14:54.588 --> 14:58.413
than listen to any more of this puppet show.

14:58.413 --> 15:05.227
Do we understand each other?

15:43.507 --> 15:50.191
Eddie!  Speak!  Speak, Eddie!

16:16.245 --> 16:21.612
Fire!  Fire, everybody!  Frasier!
Daphne!  Fire!  Fire!

16:21.612 --> 16:23.060
What's going on?!

16:23.060 --> 16:25.592
The fire alarm went off, but I don't
see anything around here!

16:25.592 --> 16:27.400
It's not in my room, either!

16:27.400 --> 16:29.481
It's O.K.!

16:29.481 --> 16:32.475
My fault, false alarm.

16:32.475 --> 16:37.922
I was just a little remiss in replacing
the batteries, everything's fine.

16:37.922 --> 16:40.529
The batteries?  No, smoke alarms don't go off if?

16:40.529 --> 16:42.387
Back to bed!

16:42.387 --> 16:51.971
See you in the morning.

16:51.971 --> 16:55.602
Dad, you know, seeing as how we're both up,

16:55.602 --> 17:00.248
I thought maybe we should, oh I dunno, 
do something, you know?

17:00.248 --> 17:01.327
Like what?

17:01.327 --> 17:06.064
Well, uh, right off the top of my head,
I... well, play a little chess?

17:06.064 --> 17:06.913
Now?

17:06.913 --> 17:10.728
Well, sure!  We're both wide awake.

17:10.728 --> 17:15.039
Oh my God, you set that alarm off!

17:15.039 --> 17:16.577
Dad!  I—I had no?

17:16.577 --> 17:20.071
What kind of weird, competitive freak are you?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.505
I mean, you really hate to lose so much
that you wake up the whole house

17:22.505 --> 17:23.751
and scare us all to death?

17:23.751 --> 17:24.958
No, of course not!

17:24.958 --> 17:28.615
And I wouldn't have to resort to such
lengths if this damn dog could learn to speak!

17:28.615 --> 17:30.848
Oh, of course, now you'll get it right!

17:30.848 --> 17:32.463
Look, Dad, would one more game kill you?

17:32.463 --> 17:34.184
I mean, you're all riled up.

17:34.184 --> 17:36.624
My God, you'll never get to sleep now anyway!

17:36.624 --> 17:38.224
Wait a minute.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.729
This isn't about losing, is it?

17:39.729 --> 17:41.912
This is about losing to me.

17:41.912 --> 17:43.975
That's what's driving you nuts!

17:43.975 --> 17:45.293
"How could I lose to the old man?

17:45.293 --> 17:46.631
I'm much smarter than he is!"

17:46.631 --> 17:47.414
I never said that!

17:47.414 --> 17:49.094
No, you didn't have to say it, you've
thought it all your life!

17:49.094 --> 17:49.695
No, I haven't!

17:49.695 --> 17:51.810
Yes, you have, and now you're insulting
my intelligence again!

17:51.810 --> 17:52.519
Oh, Dad!

17:52.519 --> 17:55.574
Hey, now listen, what do you think
I was doing as a detective all those years?

17:55.574 --> 17:59.743
Analyzing clues, devising strategies,
trying to stay one or two steps ahead

17:59.743 --> 18:00.455
of the other guys

18:00.455 --> 18:02.039
now, does that sound like any game that you know?

18:02.039 --> 18:04.158
All right, that explains why you can play the game,

18:04.158 --> 18:07.048
but not why you beat me every time!

18:07.048 --> 18:09.241
Now, come on, just one more game, please?

18:09.241 --> 18:11.431
Dad, look, I'll never bring it up again!

18:11.431 --> 18:12.350
Come on!

18:12.350 --> 18:14.798
No.  Why should I?

18:14.798 --> 18:17.449
You just want to beat me so that
you can go back to thinking you're smarter than

18:17.449 --> 18:18.493
your stupid old man.

18:18.493 --> 18:20.718
Well, forget it, to hell with you.

18:20.718 --> 18:24.774
I don't see any reason why I should
ever play you again.

18:24.774 --> 18:27.038
If you win, I'll give you five thousand dollars.

18:27.038 --> 18:32.255
Get out of my way.

18:32.255 --> 18:37.303
Well, look at that, the board's all set up!
What a surprise.

18:37.303 --> 18:39.734
I took the liberty.

18:39.734 --> 18:42.831
Now, Dad, I think we can sit down and
play a nice cordial little game.

18:42.831 --> 18:48.688
For centuries, people have set aside 
their differences to play a game of chess.

18:48.688 --> 18:51.416
So, who should go first?

18:51.416 --> 18:52.556
Well, let's see.

18:52.556 --> 18:55.262
It's usually the person who lost the last game.

18:55.262 --> 18:58.181
Now, who could that be?

18:58.181 --> 19:06.885
OK.  No more Mr. Cordial Guy!

19:06.885 --> 19:14.773
By the way, I'm sorry the ratings for
your show took a dive last month.

19:14.773 --> 19:26.020
Don't try to pull your cheap psychological
tricks on me.

19:26.020 --> 19:34.084
Oh, did I mention... the cemetery called?

19:34.084 --> 19:42.693
Apparently they have to dig a sewer
next to your plot.

19:42.693 --> 19:51.924
Getting your dog to stare at me only
proves how desperate you are.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.234
I didn't tell him to do that.

19:54.234 --> 19:58.437
He just gets fascinated when he sees people sweat.

19:58.437 --> 20:00.932
I sweat when I'm happy.

20:00.932 --> 20:04.068
Well, then you must be ecstatic!

20:04.068 --> 20:04.503
No, wait!

20:04.503 --> 20:05.581
No, no, you took your finger off that piece!

20:05.581 --> 20:06.020
No, I didn't!

20:06.020 --> 20:08.356
Yes, you did!

20:08.356 --> 20:12.789
That means that you must not trust
that move, must have left yourself
vulnerable somewhere.

20:12.789 --> 20:24.411
Well, even if I did, you'll never find it.

20:24.411 --> 20:34.797
Oh, look at that... what's this?

20:34.797 --> 20:39.238
Could it be... checkmate?

20:39.238 --> 20:43.195
I won, I won, I really won!

20:43.195 --> 20:45.139
Hey, I didn't gloat when I beat
you all those times!

20:45.139 --> 20:49.106
No, but, I bet you wish you did now,
huh?  Ha-ha, it feels great!

20:49.106 --> 20:51.698
All right, that's it.  I'm going to bed.

20:51.698 --> 20:56.149
And I never want to hear the word
"chess," or "board," or "chessboard" again!

20:56.149 --> 20:58.147
That's it, got it?

20:58.147 --> 21:00.517
Fine.  Fine, Dad.  Goodnight.

21:00.517 --> 21:04.097
Geez, lighten up!  It's only a game!

21:16.930 --> 21:18.138
Dad?  Dad?

21:18.138 --> 21:19.348
Oh, jeez...

21:19.348 --> 21:24.237
No, no, please, just one question:
did you let me win?

21:24.237 --> 21:27.229
Oh, for crying out loud, Frasier...

21:27.229 --> 21:30.436
No, no, please, did you play your best?

21:30.436 --> 21:33.244
For five thousand bucks?  What do you think?

21:33.244 --> 21:36.294
You wouldn't just be saying that?

21:36.294 --> 21:39.857
On your mother's grave, may lightning
strike me down,

21:39.857 --> 21:43.867
I, Martin Crane, swear on the holiest
of Bibles, you won,

21:43.867 --> 21:52.202
I lost, fair and square, cross my heart
and hope to go to sleep.

21:52.202 --> 21:53.026
Thank you, Dad.

21:53.026 --> 22:01.517
You're welcome.

22:01.517 --> 22:05.810
I'm sorry I beat you, Dad.
