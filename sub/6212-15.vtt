WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:04.171
There.

00:04.171 --> 00:07.107
Nothing says love like
a gussied up internal organ.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.742
Any big
Valentine plans?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.077
No.

00:10.077 --> 00:14.448
No, no big plans, yet.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.382
HILDA:
Behold.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.284
Hilda's Valentine's brew.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.186
I'm calling it
"Capapinko."

00:19.186 --> 00:21.255
Looks like
warmed-over
Pepto-Bismol.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.956
Ew, it tastes
like it, too.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.191
That's because it is.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.592
Are you sure you're
not going overboard

00:25.592 --> 00:27.227
with this whole
Valentine thing?

00:27.227 --> 00:28.762
Absolutely not.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.197
Hilda's is going
to be the place

00:30.197 --> 00:31.765
for hot young
couples in the know.

00:31.765 --> 00:35.335
Desserts, coffee, cabaret.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.271
I'm going to perform.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.439
Can you think of a better way
to end a romantic evening?

00:39.439 --> 00:41.508
I can't think
of a faster way.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.944
Oh, speaking
of romantic evenings

00:43.944 --> 00:45.245
I've got to get out
of here.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.080
I still have to
make my plans for
Valentine's Day.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.383
Which I'm sure includes
a stop at Hilda's.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.717
Yeah, right.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.653
It's my first
Valentine's Day with Morgan.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.688
I want everything
to be perfect.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.758
I'm planning a moonlight cruise
around Boston Harbor

00:57.758 --> 00:59.359
and as the boat gently rocks

00:59.359 --> 01:01.428
we can snuggle
beneath the stars.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.463
Sound romantic enough?

01:03.463 --> 01:03.864
Sure.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.434
If you're into that
whole nautical display
of affection thing.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.370
I really admire
you, Sabrina.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.204
What do you mean?

01:11.204 --> 01:13.006
Well, the guy that you've
had a thing for

01:13.006 --> 01:15.442
is apparently
head over heels
for your roommate.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.946
And you're dealing with it
like a mature, rational adult.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.314
What does
that feel like?

01:20.314 --> 01:22.916
Well, you just have
to accept it and not
let it get to you.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.751
You know, it's nothing
to get upset over.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.120
Well, I am so impressed.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.222
Think you can help
me finish off these
decorations?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.691
No problem.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.197
Okay, maybe I am
just a tad upset.

01:41.568 --> 01:48.375
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:48.375 --> 01:54.481
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:54.481 --> 01:58.018
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:58.018 --> 02:04.191

02:04.191 --> 02:07.694

02:07.694 --> 02:12.099

02:23.043 --> 02:24.144
Sorry about that.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.145
No, no problem.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.314
Next time, I get to lead.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.790
Smooth. Guys like a girl who
can do her own stunts.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.924
Isn't he cute?

02:37.924 --> 02:39.593
We've been smiling
at each other all week.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.928
I'm hoping he's going to ask
me out for Valentine's Day.

02:41.928 --> 02:42.663
Oh please.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.631
Don't tell me you're
another of those poor,
pathetic souls

02:44.631 --> 02:47.467
who feels worthless if
she doesn't have a date
for Valentine's Day.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.036
Well I guess I don't
have to tell you now.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.737
Sabrina, Valentine's Day
is nothing more

02:50.737 --> 02:51.838
then a commercial
rip-off.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.174
They should just rename it
St. Suckers Day.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.108
Hey.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.076
Miles, tell her

02:56.076 --> 02:57.577
that Valentine's Day
is nothing more

02:57.577 --> 03:00.213
then a bogus holiday
engineered by the
greeting card industry.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.783
In cahoots with
the flower companies
and candy manufacturers.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.685
I have a hunch that
the Trilateral Commission

03:04.685 --> 03:06.153
is also involved.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.456
How cute. I never realized how
much you two have in common.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.358
SALEM:
<i>So, Hilda, got any</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:12.859
Valentine's plans?

03:12.859 --> 03:13.760
Oh, yeah.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.929
Big goings on
down at the coffee house.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.730
And you?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.899
Watching the <i>Love Boat</i>
marathon.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.934
Well, we're doing better
than most years, my friend.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.502
Cheers.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.337
Of course, Zelda probably
has incredible plans

03:24.337 --> 03:25.872
that will put us
both to shame.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.076
Just like she's thrown in my
face every Valentine's Day

03:29.076 --> 03:31.678
for the last 611 years.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.547
Guess again, girl-frent.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.216
I happened to catch a peek
at her appointment book.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.618
Salem, that's private.

03:38.618 --> 03:42.222
Hey, I had to use the box
and I needed something to read.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.426
Does anyone know why there's
sand in my day-planner?

03:46.426 --> 03:47.894
What are you smiling about?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.229
Oh, nothing.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.031
What are you doing Wednesday?

03:51.031 --> 03:52.432
Oh, catching up on
some reading

03:52.432 --> 03:54.434
grading some papers.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.736
My Lord, look
at that.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.003
It's Valentine's Day.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.606
And you don't have any plans
and I do.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.308
I am throwing a huge
Valentine's bash

04:01.308 --> 04:03.877
down at my highly successful
coffee establishment.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.246
Hilda, when are you
going to get it
through your head

04:06.246 --> 04:09.583
that Valentine's Day is not
a competition between us?

04:09.583 --> 04:13.186
I've been waiting for this day
for 611 years.

04:13.186 --> 04:13.754
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

04:13.754 --> 04:16.423
You really ought to get
yourself a hobby.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.492
I have a hobby--

04:18.492 --> 04:20.127
gloating.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.595
Yes?

04:21.595 --> 04:22.896
Hi. I hate to bother you

04:22.896 --> 04:25.232
but I noticed a few
of your outgoing letters

04:25.232 --> 04:26.299
didn't have stamps.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.401
Oh, sorry about that.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.470
Thank you for bringing
it to my attention.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.271
It's my job.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.874
And you do it
so well.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.077
Say, would you like to be
my date for Valentine's Day?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.112
Well, sure.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.749
Most people just give me
a dollar or some stale candy.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.351
What a delightful
sense of humor.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.987
Okay, well, uh,
Wednesday then.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.256
See you at 8:00... Calvin.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.891
I'll see you at 8:00...

04:50.891 --> 04:52.659
Zelda or Hilda Spellman.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.227
Zelda.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.065
What?

04:59.065 --> 04:59.900
How could I say no

04:59.900 --> 05:03.270
and break his poor little
civil servant heart?

05:03.270 --> 05:07.040
And you can make that
612 in a row.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.610
I don't mind not
having a date for
Valentine's Day.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.079
It's just I'm going
to miss the romantic
stuff, you know?

05:13.079 --> 05:15.649
Yeah, I had this one
romantic Valentine's Day.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
This guy I was seeing
gave me an ankle bracelet,
a necklace and earrings.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.520
Wow, that's
quite a haul.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.254
That's what
the jury said

05:21.254 --> 05:24.124
right before they sent him
away for armed robbery.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.027
Well, at least you know
he's not with another girl.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.630
Oh, this year I don't
want to hear another word
about Valentine's Day.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.933
Hey, guys.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.502
Guess what Josh
and I are doing
for Valentine's Day?

05:35.502 --> 05:38.205
Well, that was
a blissful
nanosecond.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.273
Josh is going
to surprise me with roses--

05:40.273 --> 05:41.341
red, not pink

05:41.341 --> 05:43.009
and chocolates--

05:43.009 --> 05:44.444
dark, no nuts.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.979
And then he's taking me
to dinner

05:45.979 --> 05:48.215
at this fabulous seafood place.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.450
Gee, I never knew I was
so thoughtful.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.551
By the time
she's through
with you

05:51.551 --> 05:53.920
you'll be thoughtful
and broke.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.857
Well, I guess I have
my work cut out for me.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.091
I will see
you later.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.025
Okay.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.229
( <i>loud clanking</i> )

06:02.229 --> 06:04.164
Bye.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.532
Hey.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.902
What happened to
the whole moonlit,
romantic harbor cruise?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.104
I never got a chance
to tell her about it.

06:11.104 --> 06:11.872
You know Morgan.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.773
She knows what
she wants.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.778
Josh is so perfect.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.280
I mean, sure he needs
a little push

06:20.280 --> 06:21.281
in the right direction.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.516
But what man doesn't?

06:23.516 --> 06:26.019
This is absolutely
the best relationship

06:26.019 --> 06:27.621
I have ever been in.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.990
Well, you certainly had
a lot to compare it to.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.258
Thank you.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.460
So, what are
your plans?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.494
Oh, no big plans yet.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.662
But I'm hoping something's
going to happen

06:35.662 --> 06:37.597
with this guy in my
Philosophy class.

06:37.597 --> 06:38.765
Name?

06:38.765 --> 06:40.800
Kevin O'...
something or other.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.568
Kevin O'Conner!

06:41.568 --> 06:42.936
Tall, artsy...

06:42.936 --> 06:45.071
asked me out,
I rejected him.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.606
Perfect for you.

06:46.706 --> 06:47.374
Don't worry.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.209
I will set
the whole thing up.

06:49.209 --> 06:49.609
Oh, no, no, no.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.144
You really don't have
to call him.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.447
Please, Sabrina,
it's the least I can do.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.882
I mean, I owe you.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.017
For what?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.719
You're the one who
introduced me to Josh.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.856
Well, in that case,
start dialing.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.658
You owe me big time.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.861
Don't tell me
you're standing here

07:07.861 --> 07:09.529
trying to look cool
just so Morgan's friend

07:09.529 --> 07:11.231
can discover you
in the hallway?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.565
Why do you keep
asking me questions

07:12.565 --> 07:14.935
you don't want
to hear the answers to?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.636
Sabrina?

07:16.636 --> 07:17.904
Hi, I'm Roxie

07:17.904 --> 07:19.306
and yes, the cool girl
with water coming out

07:19.306 --> 07:21.441
of her nose
is Sabrina.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.008
Yeah, it's important

07:22.008 --> 07:24.210
to keep your
nasal cavity
well hydrated.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.211
You must be Kevin.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.047
Yeah. It's nice
to meet you.

07:27.047 --> 07:27.847
Well, this is
kind of weird

07:27.847 --> 07:28.581
but I guess
we have a date

07:28.581 --> 07:30.617
for Valentine's Day.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.785
Morgan did tell you that right?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.287
Because if she didn't, then
things just got really weird.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.355
No, no, she told me.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.890
I'm really
looking forward to it.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.425
I mean, you know,
if you are.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.160
Oh, yeah, of course I am.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.395
So, uh... Morgan will
give you the details.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.964
She's got
the whole thing worked out.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.597
Morgan?

07:44.597 --> 07:45.332
KEVIN:
Yeah, we're doubling

07:45.332 --> 07:46.366
with her and Josh.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.133
I think the four of us

07:47.133 --> 07:48.368
will have a really great time.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.170
I'll see you.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.238
Bye.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.440
Four of us?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.208
A double date with
Pete and Patty Perfect.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.477
That'll be a
rocking good time.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.311
It won't be
so bad.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.546
I mean, Kevin seems nice

07:59.546 --> 08:02.115
and Morgan's easy
to take in small doses

08:02.115 --> 08:03.850
and Josh and I have
so much history

08:03.850 --> 08:05.719
we're practically
like cousins.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.754
All I can say is,
I'd rather be in
a Turkish prison

08:07.754 --> 08:09.389
than on that
double date.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.426
That could be so easy.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.427
( <i>magical tinkle</i> )

08:14.427 --> 08:15.495
Shh!

08:15.495 --> 08:16.096
I can't believe

08:16.096 --> 08:17.831
you're actually going
through with this.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.033
What could you possibly
have to say to a mailman?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.301
Well, it just
so happens

08:21.301 --> 08:22.836
that I've been doing
some reading

08:22.836 --> 08:25.839
and the history
of the postal service
is actually quite...

08:25.839 --> 08:27.941
Why is there sand
all over it?

08:27.941 --> 08:31.711
Airmail pilots
were strong and brave.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.413
You're only going
out with him so you'll

08:33.413 --> 08:35.315
have a better
Valentine's Day than me.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.316
Well, sister...

08:36.316 --> 08:37.751
and I mean that literally

08:37.751 --> 08:39.686
this is going to be one
for the record books.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.887
Because after tonight

08:40.887 --> 08:42.856
I'm going to be
the toast of Westbridge--

08:42.856 --> 08:45.592
The queen of V.D.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.761
Valentine's Day.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.662
That certainly
says V.D. to me.

08:49.662 --> 08:50.430
Morgan, hurry up.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.831
We're going to be late.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.502
Guess it's just going
to be the two of us.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.637
Got any plans
for tonight?

08:57.637 --> 08:59.506
What's that
supposed to mean?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.741
I mean, we're in
the same house.

09:01.741 --> 09:02.776
I'm not doing anything

09:02.776 --> 09:04.811
and I just thought
maybe we could play

09:04.811 --> 09:10.550
Risk or Battleship or...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.385
I'm going to go
to my room now.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.688
Roxie, why are you
so mean to Miles?

09:15.688 --> 09:16.923
I didn't say
anything.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.558
You can destroy
somebody with a look.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.194
Yeah, it's the one good thing
I got from my mom.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.463
I'm late
so make it quick.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.264
Blah, blah, blah.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.598
I look gorgeous,
blah, blah, blah.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.766
Breathtaking.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.701
Okay, let's move out,
Spellman.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.903
Bye, Roxie.
Have fun tonight.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.337
And try to be
nice to Miles.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.505
I'll try.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.774
As long as dork boy
doesn't make me play Perquacky.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.776
I have a feeling
you won't mind.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.845
Make Miles' good points
clear as a bell--

09:38.845 --> 09:40.580
let Roxie think
he's really swell.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.116
( <i>magical tinkle</i> )

09:43.116 --> 09:44.217
What are you mumbling?

09:44.217 --> 09:46.986
Oh, uh, a little
pre-date pep talk.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.621
Go, team.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.625
Roxie?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.761
I don't mean in any way
to invade your space

09:54.761 --> 09:56.596
but I just remembered
it's <i>Planet of The Apes</i> week

09:56.596 --> 09:58.631
on the Sci-Fi Channel.

09:58.631 --> 09:59.399
Do you mind?

09:59.399 --> 10:02.335
No, I guess... not.

10:02.335 --> 10:13.847
( <i>romantic music swells</i> )

10:13.847 --> 10:14.380
I never realized

10:14.380 --> 10:18.017
what beautiful
eyes you have.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.087
You aren't by any chance
talking to me, are you?

10:21.087 --> 10:23.556
Do you see anyone
else here?

10:24.090 --> 10:27.727
So, uh... did
you grow up
in Westbridge?

10:27.727 --> 10:29.596
Uh, yeah, well,
I lived here

10:29.596 --> 10:32.098
when I was 16.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.500
That's really
interesting.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.901
No, it's not.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.804
Come on, people.
Cut to the chase.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.105
Now, Sabrina writes
for the paper

10:39.105 --> 10:41.274
and is an
accomplished
scuba diver.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.509
Kevin writes songs

10:42.509 --> 10:44.277
and once won
Battle of The Bands.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.311
-You dive?
-You write music?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.647
Sometimes people just
need a little push

10:47.647 --> 10:49.048
in the right direction.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.050
And you're awfully
good at pushing.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.418
Thank you.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.853
If you'd like to pick out
your lobsters

10:53.853 --> 10:55.622
we can get started
on your entrees.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.623
Oh, I can do it.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.991
My dad's a seafood
wholesaler

10:57.991 --> 11:00.627
so I know my way
around a crustacean.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.729
Make sure they're alert,
between two and three pounds

11:02.729 --> 11:04.297
and the shells
aren't discolored.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.765
Thanks for pointing that out.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.433
You're welcome, honey.

11:09.302 --> 11:13.239
Oh, I'm starting to get
that tingly feeling.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.174
Is your throat
closing up?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.775
Because you might be
allergic to the shrimp.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.076
That is so weird.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.179
I just wrote a song
about someone who's
allergic to shrimp.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.813
Reallly,it must be hard
to find something

11:20.813 --> 11:22.815
that rhymes
with "allergic."

11:22.815 --> 11:26.553
Hello? Trying to express
an emotion here.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.921
I think tonight is the night

11:27.921 --> 11:30.690
that Josh is finally going
to say I love you.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.558
To you?

11:31.558 --> 11:34.027
I mean, like here? Tonight?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.129
I didn't know you guys were
that serious about each other.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.664
Very serious.

11:37.664 --> 11:38.798
But here's my problem.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.900
Now, when he says it,
do I kiss him first

11:40.900 --> 11:43.469
and then say it, or do I say it
and then kiss him?

11:43.469 --> 11:44.671
Say it and then kiss.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.306
Sabrina?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.006
Uh, you know

11:47.006 --> 11:48.374
why don't I
go mull it over

11:48.374 --> 11:50.577
in the little gull's room
while I freshen up.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.882
Let me guess.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.751
You didn't trust me
to pick out your
lobster either.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.254
No, I'm going
to wash my hands.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.322
Listen, Josh, I just want to say

12:02.322 --> 12:03.656
I'm really happy
for you and Morgan.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.924
I mean, I think it's great

12:04.924 --> 12:06.759
that everything's working out
for you guys.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.728
Sabrina, I'm breaking up
with Morgan tonight.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.329
What?!

12:09.329 --> 12:10.163
I have had it.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.398
I am so sick of her
ordering me around

12:12.398 --> 12:14.167
and telling me what
I should and shouldn't do.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.568
But it's Valentine's Day.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.671
Well, she'll have something
to remember it by.

12:18.671 --> 12:23.109
A kiss-off and that
cross-eyed lobster.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.915
Josh,you can't break up with
Morgan. You really care about
her.

12:28.915 --> 12:29.949
I know, but she drives

12:29.949 --> 12:31.251
me insane, all right?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.619
I give my heart
and soul to her

12:32.619 --> 12:33.753
I get nothing in return.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.021
What am I supposed to do?

12:35.021 --> 12:38.658
Don't do anything
until I... powder my nose.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.159
Can't that wait?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.795
I guess it can't.

12:45.231 --> 12:49.302
Julie McCoy, I'd meet you
on the Aloha Deck any time.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.906
Help! I'm having
a little middate crisis.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.608
You think
you've got problems.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.811
Captain Stubing just got dumped
by Phyllis Diller.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.414
Okay, since the words "help"
and "crisis" aren't registering

13:01.414 --> 13:02.415
is Aunt Zelda around?

13:02.415 --> 13:05.118
Yep, she and Cliff Clavin are
playing Post Office

13:05.118 --> 13:06.419
in the other room.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.955
So...

13:08.955 --> 13:10.890
So.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.426
Oh, here's a question.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.328
The new nine-digit zip code--

13:15.328 --> 13:17.497
crazy fad or here to stay?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.498
I'm not sure.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.401
I think it's a law
or something.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.536
Aunt Zelda,
sorry to interrupt.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.071
Oh, you're not interrupting.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.106
Sabrina, meet our new mailman,
Calvin.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.108
Sit, eat.
Let me get you a plate.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.109
You're the niece.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.511
Aren't you supposed
to be on a date?

13:31.511 --> 13:32.512
Oh, I wasn't...

13:32.512 --> 13:34.514
I mean, I am on a date

13:34.514 --> 13:37.016
but the whole Josh-Morgan
thing just exploded.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.118
Give me the shorthand.
Who's Josh? Who's Morgan?

13:39.118 --> 13:40.753
Morgan's my roommate
and Josh is her boyfriend

13:40.753 --> 13:42.855
who wanted to be my boyfriend
while I still had a boyfriend

13:42.855 --> 13:44.157
but once I got rid
of that boyfriend

13:44.157 --> 13:45.291
and wanted Josh
for my boyfriend

13:45.291 --> 13:46.292
we were just friends.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.226
With you so far.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.628
Now he wants to break up
with Morgan

13:48.628 --> 13:49.862
because he thinks
she doesn't like him

13:49.862 --> 13:51.564
but I know that she does.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.933
I'm sorry.
What's the problem?

13:53.933 --> 13:56.069
If I don't say anything
to Morgan and they break up

13:56.069 --> 13:57.837
that makes Josh
technically available.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.138
It's an interesting
dilemma.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.541
Does Sabrina help them fix
their relationship

14:01.541 --> 14:03.109
or does she keep
her mouth shut

14:03.109 --> 14:05.578
and claim the man who
could be rightfully hers?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.346
Exactly.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.081
Well, in that case, Sabrina

14:08.081 --> 14:09.415
Morgan's your friend.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.617
You're going to have to put
your own feelings aside

14:11.617 --> 14:12.819
and do whatever you can
to help her.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.620
But she can't deny her feelings
for Josh.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.622
Hence the dilemma.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.492
Is there any kind
of a magical solution

14:19.492 --> 14:20.727
that might solve this?

14:20.727 --> 14:21.728
Afraid not.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.662
Your aunt's right.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.665
There are no simple solutions
when it comes to relationships.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.901
Do everything you can
to help your friends

14:28.901 --> 14:30.737
then if they still break up

14:30.737 --> 14:34.374
you won't fill guilty
about making your move.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.008
Wow, that's good advice.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.444
Thanks, mailman. Got to go.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.614
That really was
good advice.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.548
I had no idea

14:42.548 --> 14:43.716
you were so sensitive.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.517
Do you have any idea

14:44.517 --> 14:47.420
how many copies
of <i>Psychology Today</i> I deliver?

14:48.654 --> 14:51.691
Sorry, but you know how
ladies' rooms can be.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.992
Or maybe you don't.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.293
I hope you don't.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.429
Oh, look, lobster! Ooh!

14:56.963 --> 14:59.565
Oh, they're so small.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.602
I told you to get the
ones that were bigger.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.171
Oh well uh, sometimes
they take

15:05.171 --> 15:07.807
a few minutes
to plump.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.608
Happy?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.309
Yeah, of course she's happy.
Everyone's happy.

15:10.309 --> 15:11.077
Are you happy, Kevin?

15:11.077 --> 15:12.678
Yeah, and if the waiter
brings me a big bib

15:12.678 --> 15:14.080
I'll be really happy.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.417
Wait, wait, wait.
No one eats until
we have a toast.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.985
Morgan, maybe they
don't want a toast.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.753
Maybe they'd
just like to eat.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.321
Josh, what is the matter
with you?

15:22.321 --> 15:24.023
You're always telling everyone
what to do.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.224
Is that what you think?

15:25.224 --> 15:27.160
Yeah, it is.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.761
You know,I think he means that
sometimes

15:28.761 --> 15:30.196
you can just be, like, a tad...

15:30.196 --> 15:32.598
Excuse me. Our business.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.367
Don't yell at Sabrina.
She's just trying to help.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.535
I don't need her help.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.670
Right, you don't need
anything from anybody.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.739
What I don't need is
your attitude.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.740
Oh, really?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.041
You want the list
of things

15:42.041 --> 15:42.809
I don't need from you?

15:42.809 --> 15:43.876
Oh, a list.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.978
Nice to see you finally
organized something

15:45.978 --> 15:48.815
on your own for a change.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.217
I'm so out of here.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.053
And don't even try
to stop me.

15:55.221 --> 15:59.625
Morgan, wait.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.593
If you see the waiter

16:00.593 --> 16:04.330
could you tell him
we need some more butter?

16:07.867 --> 16:10.336
Look, I am sorry you
guys had to see that.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.270
I don't know what
I was thinking

16:11.270 --> 16:13.005
getting involved
with Morgan.

16:13.005 --> 16:13.706
Let's face it.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.007
We were never meant
to be together.

16:15.007 --> 16:19.378
I was probably just another
notch in her Gucci belt.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.048
Josh, Morgan is in love
with you.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.449
What? She told you that?

16:23.449 --> 16:24.550
Yeah, she told us that

16:24.550 --> 16:27.520
while you were
over playing God
with the lobsters.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.088
Really? Well, if she's
in love with me

16:29.088 --> 16:30.656
why is she always
bossing me around?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.058
Well, maybe she doesn't know it
bothers you.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.159
Maybe that's just her style.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.560
Have you ever talked
to her about it?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.595
No.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.797
Well, I think you owe it
to yourself and to Morgan

16:37.797 --> 16:40.233
to get all your feelings
out there before you break up

16:40.233 --> 16:42.668
or get back together.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.070
Maybe you're right.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.605
Josh, I think you need
to talk to her.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.440
Yeah, well, after that
crack about the butter

16:47.440 --> 16:49.375
I don't think
that'll be an option.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.710
Good point. Got to go.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.011
Hey, what about our date?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.480
Oh, it was fun.
Call me.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.215
Come on, Miles,
it's no big deal.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.483
I just want
to hold you.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.118
I know, but it's
not the right situation.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.521
But intimacy's
very frightening
for me.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.323
Then get ready
to be terrified.

17:08.194 --> 17:12.665
If anybody cares,
I had a very traumatic evening.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.403
That sexy little scamp thinks
he can climb out the window.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.138
Well, I've got a window, too.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.409
Oh, ooh. Morgan,
you're here.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.144
I really want to talk to you
about this evening.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.346
How could Josh treat me
like that?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.814
I thought he cared
about me.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.349
He does care about you.

17:30.349 --> 17:33.486
He just doesn't like to be
bossed around.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.154
So I have an opinion.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.889
If I hadn't organized
the whole evening

17:36.889 --> 17:38.524
we never would have
gone anywhere.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.792
Yes, you would have.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.229
Josh wanted to take you
on a romantic moonlight cruise.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.931
Really?

17:45.197 --> 17:46.666
Why didn't he tell me?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.734
You didn't give him
a chance to.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.336
If you guys don't start
listening to each other more

17:50.336 --> 17:51.337
you're going to end up

17:51.337 --> 17:53.072
bossing around somebody new
every month.

17:53.072 --> 17:58.044
Well, that's what
I used to do till Josh.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.380
He's so sweet
and sensitive.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.816
The one guy that I actually
could see having

18:03.816 --> 18:06.686
a long-term
relationship with.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.855
Sabrina, I don't want
it to be over.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.058
Don't tell me. Tell him.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.293
I don't even know
where he is.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.829
Uh, he's at the coffee house.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.897
How do you know?

18:17.897 --> 18:19.365
Just call it a hunch.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.235
I've got to get some coffee.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.477
( <i>playing folk music</i> )

18:36.649 --> 18:38.017
Well, hello.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.052
Welcome to Hilda's.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.188
Take a seat.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.523
So, are you ready
to give up?

18:44.523 --> 18:45.891
Admit that my Valentine's

18:45.891 --> 18:48.394
is ten times more fabulous
than yours could ever be?

18:48.394 --> 18:51.163
Actually, this date is
going extremely well.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.299
This mailman delivers.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.735
Uh, just so I'm clear.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.503
You're saying that
this random guy

18:57.503 --> 19:00.139
who arbitrarily rang our
doorbell is turning out

19:00.139 --> 19:02.041
to be your dream date?

19:02.041 --> 19:03.342
It's a crazy world.

19:03.342 --> 19:06.078
Yeah, it's freakin' hysterical.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.314
All right, you're done.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.784
Okay, happy Valentine's Day.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.486
What a great holiday.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.287
I'm about
one bad relationship away

19:15.287 --> 19:17.123
from being one of those women
who has 30 cats

19:17.123 --> 19:20.026
and pathetically names them
after ex-boyfriends.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.561
"Hairy Back. Big Fat Liar!

19:22.561 --> 19:23.829
Dinner's Ready!"

19:24.997 --> 19:27.333
I had another cat that can't
commit, but he ran away.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.836
Ooh, there's Josh.
Go talk to him.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.171
Oh, I can't.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.239
Well, if you don't,
I will

19:33.239 --> 19:34.807
and who knows what I'll say.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.308
All right, I'm going.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.511
Thanks, Sabrina.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.382
HILDA:
Some of you are probably saying,
"Wow, is she bitter."

19:43.382 --> 19:44.183
Hi.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
Hey, honey.
Are you okay?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.254
Yeah, I did
the right thing.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.424
Josh and Morgan should
be together and...

19:51.424 --> 19:54.427
well, I should just
get on with my life.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.328
Hey, how was the guy
you went out with?

19:56.328 --> 19:57.363
He was really cute

19:57.363 --> 19:58.464
but I screwed up
the whole date

19:58.464 --> 20:00.966
before I even got
a chance to know him.

20:00.966 --> 20:01.333
I'm going to go home

20:01.333 --> 20:03.369
and eat my weight
in chocolates now.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.074
Sorry. Oh, hey!

20:08.074 --> 20:09.875
We got to stop
meeting like this.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.477
Kevin, look, I'm really sorry
about tonight.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.579
I handled things really badly.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.314
Do you think we could
try it again?

20:15.314 --> 20:18.584
Yeah, I'd like that.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.585
So, can I buy you

20:19.585 --> 20:20.753
a cup of coffee?

20:20.753 --> 20:21.987
Sure.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.089
HILDA:
Here's another thing I hate

20:23.089 --> 20:24.557
about people in relationships:

20:24.557 --> 20:27.126
that they're <i>in relationships.</i>

20:27.426 --> 20:28.294
You know, I know
a great place

20:28.294 --> 20:29.161
down the street.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.029
Yeah.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.004
I had a really great
time tonight.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.072
Yeah, we're on a roll,
you know?

20:40.072 --> 20:43.209
It's our first night out
and we've already had two dates.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.678
So, is it too early
if I call you tomorrow?

20:45.678 --> 20:48.180
You can call me
as soon as I get inside.

20:54.153 --> 20:54.854
Good night.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.994
Whoops, I guess Miles had
a few more good points

21:01.994 --> 21:04.230
than I realized.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.631
I know how this looks.

21:05.631 --> 21:06.432
I tried to put
up a fight

21:06.432 --> 21:10.402
but she's
very persistent.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.204
Well, since it's almost the end
of Valentine's night

21:12.204 --> 21:14.073
let's give Roxie back her bite.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.476
Oh, my God.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.778
What have I done?

21:18.778 --> 21:19.879
You've made this

21:19.879 --> 21:23.249
the most special
Valentine's Day ever.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.184
You repulse me!

21:25.818 --> 21:26.652
I'm okay with that.
