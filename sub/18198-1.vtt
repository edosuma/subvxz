WEBVTT

02:19.474 --> 02:23.498
Oh, for a muse of fire...

02:23.538 --> 02:28.872
that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention.

02:50.048 --> 02:53.432
A kingdom for a stage,

02:53.644 --> 02:55.203
princes to act...

02:56.697 --> 03:00.442
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

03:01.188 --> 03:03.956
Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself,

03:04.057 --> 03:06.611
assume the port of Mars...

03:06.626 --> 03:10.096
and at his heels,
leashed in like hounds,

03:10.126 --> 03:14.705
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

03:15.658 --> 03:18.343
But pardon, gentles all,

03:18.444 --> 03:20.979
the flat, unraised spirits...

03:21.080 --> 03:23.882
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

03:23.983 --> 03:28.044
to bring forth so great an object.

03:28.323 --> 03:32.814
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France

03:32.900 --> 03:35.966
or may we cram
within this wooden "o"...

03:36.067 --> 03:40.705
the very casques that did affright
the air at Agincourt?

03:40.806 --> 03:42.329
Oh, pardon.

03:43.342 --> 03:45.512
Let us, ciphers to this great account,

03:45.613 --> 03:48.282
on your imaginary forces work.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.986
For it is your thoughts
that now must deck our kings,

03:51.469 --> 03:54.491
carry them here, there,
jumping o'er times,

03:54.592 --> 03:59.330
turning the accomplishment of
many years into an hourglass.

04:00.259 --> 04:05.681
For the which supply,
admit me, chorus, to this history,

04:05.747 --> 04:08.634
who, prologue-like,

04:08.668 --> 04:11.271
your humble patience pray...

04:11.880 --> 04:14.405
gently to hear,

04:14.549 --> 04:16.676
kindly to judge...

04:17.370 --> 04:18.856
our play!

04:28.176 --> 04:30.837
My lord, I'll tell you.

04:36.546 --> 04:39.582
That self bill is urged,
which, in the 11th year...

04:39.683 --> 04:42.453
of the last king's reign was
like to have passed against us.

04:42.554 --> 04:45.591
But how, my lord,
shall we resist it now?

04:45.692 --> 04:47.227
It must be thought on.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.232
If it pass against us, we lose the
better half of our possession.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.992
But what prevention?

04:52.805 --> 04:55.236
The king is full of grace
and fair regard.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.973
And a true lover of the holy church.

04:58.074 --> 05:00.310
The courses of his youth
promised it not.

05:00.411 --> 05:03.079
Since his addiction
was to courses vain,

05:03.134 --> 05:05.952
his hours filled up
with riots, banquets,

05:06.053 --> 05:09.623
sports and never noted
in him any study.

05:09.724 --> 05:12.426
But, my good lord,
how now for the mitigation...

05:12.527 --> 05:14.764
of this bill urged by the commons?

05:14.865 --> 05:17.199
Doth his majesty incline to it or no?

05:17.300 --> 05:21.345
He seems... indifferent,

05:21.423 --> 05:24.743
or rather swaying more upon our part.

05:24.844 --> 05:28.337
For I have made an offer
to his majesty,

05:28.398 --> 05:30.866
as touching France.

06:28.827 --> 06:31.920
Where is my gracious
lord of Canterbury?

06:48.420 --> 06:54.028
God and his angels guard your sacred
throne and make you long become it.

06:54.129 --> 06:55.426
Sure we thank you.

06:56.407 --> 06:58.065
My learned lord,
we pray you to proceed...

06:58.166 --> 07:01.035
and justly and religiously unfold...

07:01.136 --> 07:04.705
why the law Salic
that they have in France,

07:04.799 --> 07:08.439
or should or should not
bar us in our claim.

07:09.209 --> 07:14.139
And pray, take heed
how you impawn our person,

07:14.186 --> 07:18.482
how you awake
our sleeping sword of war.

07:18.496 --> 07:21.932
We charge you,
in the name of God, take heed.

07:22.667 --> 07:27.432
For never two such kingdoms did
contend without much fall of blood.

07:30.141 --> 07:33.044
Then hear me, gracious sovereign.

07:33.145 --> 07:38.017
There is no bar to make against
your highness' claim to France...

07:38.118 --> 07:42.417
but this, which they
produce from Pharamond.

07:43.291 --> 07:47.658
"In terram Salicam
mulieres ne succedant."

07:47.684 --> 07:53.727
"No woman shall succeed in Salic land."

07:53.941 --> 07:58.278
Which Salic land
the French unjustly gloze...

07:58.379 --> 08:00.247
to be the realm of France.

08:00.348 --> 08:04.084
Yet their own authors
faithfully affirm...

08:04.185 --> 08:07.450
that the land Salic lies in Germany...

08:07.513 --> 08:10.628
between the floods of Sala and of Elbe.

08:10.729 --> 08:13.832
Then doth it well appear
the Salic law...

08:13.932 --> 08:17.536
was not devised
for the realm of France,

08:17.637 --> 08:20.140
nor did the French possess
the Salic land...

08:20.241 --> 08:25.358
until 421 years after
defunction of king Pharamond,

08:25.406 --> 08:30.603
idly supposed the founder of this law.

08:31.601 --> 08:36.027
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,

08:36.128 --> 08:39.486
did, as heir general,
being descended of Blithild,

08:39.495 --> 08:41.518
which was the daughter
to king Clothair,

08:41.565 --> 08:43.995
make claim and title
to the crown of France.

08:44.018 --> 08:48.266
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the
crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine,

08:48.310 --> 08:51.847
sole heir male of the true line
and stock of Charles the great,

08:51.949 --> 08:54.785
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France...

08:54.886 --> 08:58.323
until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother,

08:58.424 --> 09:01.394
was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,

09:01.495 --> 09:04.999
daughter to Charles,
the aforesaid duke of Lorraine,

09:05.100 --> 09:07.501
by the which marriage the line
of Charles the great...

09:07.602 --> 09:12.164
was reunited to the crown of France.

09:16.215 --> 09:19.819
So it is clear as is the summer sun.

09:21.090 --> 09:26.855
All appear to hold in right
and title of the female.

09:26.914 --> 09:30.676
So do the kings of France...

09:30.728 --> 09:32.994
unto this day.

09:35.608 --> 09:41.279
Howbeit, they would hold up
this Salic law...

09:41.318 --> 09:46.149
to bar your highness
claiming from the female.

09:47.153 --> 09:51.960
May I, with right and conscience,

09:52.711 --> 09:55.043
make this claim?

09:56.489 --> 10:00.253
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign.

10:05.027 --> 10:08.364
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.

10:08.473 --> 10:10.404
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth...

10:10.516 --> 10:12.719
do all expect that you
should rouse yourself...

10:12.820 --> 10:16.189
as did the former lions of your blood.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.825
Never king of England had nobles
richer and more loyal subjects...

10:19.926 --> 10:22.046
whose hearts have left
their bodies here in England...

10:22.062 --> 10:24.228
and lie pavilioned
in the fields of France.

10:24.329 --> 10:27.194
Oh, let their bodies follow,
my dear liege,

10:27.258 --> 10:31.596
with blood and sword and fire
to win your right.

10:32.478 --> 10:34.707
In aid whereof,

10:34.743 --> 10:38.808
we of the spirituality
will raise your highness...

10:38.909 --> 10:41.710
such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy...

10:41.811 --> 10:45.676
at one time bring in to
any of your ancestors.

10:49.451 --> 10:52.816
Call in the messengers
sent from the Dauphin.

10:57.557 --> 11:02.124
Now are we well resolved,
and by God's help and yours,

11:02.178 --> 11:06.980
the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours,

11:07.019 --> 11:10.008
we'll bend it to our all...

11:12.836 --> 11:15.894
or break it all to pieces.

11:25.663 --> 11:30.538
Now are we well prepared to know the
pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.

11:30.584 --> 11:34.085
Your highness, lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms...

11:34.117 --> 11:37.117
in the right of your great
predecessor, king Edward III.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.116
In answer of which claim,
the prince, my master,

11:40.226 --> 11:42.729
says that you savour
too much of your youth.

11:43.955 --> 11:48.729
He therefore sends you, meeter for
your spirit, this tun of treasure.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.603
And in lieu of this, desires
you let those dukedoms...

11:52.704 --> 11:54.671
that you claim hear no more of you.

11:55.389 --> 11:58.205
This the Dauphin speaks.

11:59.904 --> 12:03.968
What... treasure, uncle?

12:10.250 --> 12:13.480
Tennis balls, my liege.

12:20.961 --> 12:24.860
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

12:25.732 --> 12:30.633
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

12:31.236 --> 12:35.621
When we have matched
our rackets to these balls,

12:35.684 --> 12:38.275
we will in France, by God's grace,

12:38.376 --> 12:43.546
play a set shall strike his
father's crown into the hazard.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.849
And we understand him well,

12:45.950 --> 12:48.549
how he comes o'er us
with our wilder days,

12:48.650 --> 12:52.103
not measuring what use we made of them.

12:52.142 --> 12:55.857
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state,

12:55.958 --> 12:59.426
be like a king and show
my sail of greatness...

12:59.527 --> 13:03.826
when I do rouse me
in my throne of France.

13:03.896 --> 13:06.630
And tell the pleasant prince
this mock of his...

13:06.731 --> 13:09.162
hath turned his balls to gun stones,

13:09.201 --> 13:11.661
and his soul
shall stand sore charged...

13:11.707 --> 13:14.668
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.389
For many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

13:17.427 --> 13:19.356
mock out of their dear husbands,

13:19.418 --> 13:23.010
mock mothers from their sons,
mock castles down.

13:23.049 --> 13:25.033
And some are yet ungotten and unborn...

13:25.065 --> 13:28.624
that shall have cause
to curse the Dauphin's scorn.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.551
So get you hence in peace,

13:32.590 --> 13:35.418
and tell the Dauphin...

13:35.466 --> 13:41.002
his jest will savour
but of shallow wit...

13:41.095 --> 13:45.212
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.430
Convey them with safe conduct.

13:52.963 --> 13:54.623
Fare you well.

14:07.883 --> 14:11.942
This was a merry message.

14:12.254 --> 14:15.776
We hope to make the sender blush at it.

14:16.924 --> 14:20.494
Therefore, my lords,
omit no happy hour...

14:20.595 --> 14:22.695
that may give furtherance
to our expedition.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.422
For we have now no thought
in us but France,

14:27.461 --> 14:30.719
save those to God
that run before our business.

14:30.742 --> 14:33.969
Therefore, let every man
now task his thought...

14:34.015 --> 14:39.575
that this fair action
may on foot be brought.

14:47.717 --> 14:51.849
<i>Now all the youth of
England are on fire...</i>

14:51.886 --> 14:55.687
<i>and silken dalliance
in the wardrobe lies.</i>

14:55.819 --> 14:59.488
<i>For now sits expectation in the air...</i>

14:59.534 --> 15:02.983
<i>and hides a sword,
from hilts unto the point,</i>

15:03.034 --> 15:07.271
<i>with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets...</i>

15:07.331 --> 15:11.992
<i>promised to Harry and his followers.</i>

15:26.282 --> 15:28.616
Well met, Corporal Nym.

15:28.717 --> 15:31.947
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.

15:38.024 --> 15:42.160
What, are you and Ancient
Pistol friends yet?

15:43.042 --> 15:46.022
For my part, I care not.

15:46.063 --> 15:48.612
I say little,

15:48.649 --> 15:54.085
but when time shall serve,
there shall be smiles.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.271
But that shall be as it may.

15:57.372 --> 16:01.174
Come, I will bestow a breakfast
to make you friends,

16:01.275 --> 16:04.177
and we'll be all three
sworn brothers to France.

16:04.278 --> 16:07.973
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.

16:08.683 --> 16:12.919
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.

16:13.020 --> 16:17.453
For certainly she did you wrong,
for you were betrothed to her.

16:24.695 --> 16:27.297
How now, mine host Pistol?

16:27.741 --> 16:29.402
Base tyke!

16:30.134 --> 16:32.060
Callest thou me host?

16:32.099 --> 16:35.998
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!

16:36.060 --> 16:38.640
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers!

16:38.741 --> 16:41.334
No, by my troth, not long.

16:41.396 --> 16:44.377
For we can't lodge or board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen...

16:44.416 --> 16:47.198
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

16:47.245 --> 16:49.729
but it shall be thought
we keep a bawdy house straight.

16:49.750 --> 16:54.377
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!

16:54.432 --> 16:56.690
Good Corporal Nym,

16:56.754 --> 16:59.257
show thy valour and put up thy sword.

16:59.358 --> 17:01.625
Will you shog off?

17:01.726 --> 17:05.996
Pistol, I will prick your guts
a little in good terms, as I may.

17:06.097 --> 17:08.232
That's the humour of it.

17:08.333 --> 17:12.247
- Braggart vile!
- Ahh, hear me when I say,

17:12.300 --> 17:13.747
he that strikes the first stroke,

17:13.770 --> 17:15.872
I'll run him up to the hilts,
as I'm a soldier.

17:16.277 --> 17:19.028
An oath of mickle might,

17:19.809 --> 17:22.348
and fury shall abate.

17:22.372 --> 17:23.766
My host Pistol!

17:24.211 --> 17:26.888
You must come to my master,
and you, hostess!

17:26.974 --> 17:29.581
He's very sick and would to bed.

17:29.592 --> 17:32.991
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
sheets and do the office of a warming pan.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.110
Away, you rogue.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.881
Faith, he's very ill.

17:42.564 --> 17:43.757
By my troth,

17:45.064 --> 17:47.643
the king has killed his heart.

17:47.705 --> 17:50.259
Good husband, come home presently.

18:03.412 --> 18:07.213
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.

18:07.314 --> 18:11.050
Why the devil should we keep
knives to cut one another's throats?

18:11.151 --> 18:16.298
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.225
Base is the slave that pays.

18:19.326 --> 18:21.892
By this sword,
he that makes the first thrust,

18:21.993 --> 18:24.823
I'll kill him, by this sword, I will.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.731
If ever you come of women,
come in quickly to Sir John.

18:29.144 --> 18:32.082
He is so shaked with
a burning quotidian fever...

18:32.103 --> 18:35.569
that it is most lamentable to behold.

18:36.272 --> 18:38.738
Sweet men, come to him.

18:40.409 --> 18:42.943
Poor Sir John.

18:44.010 --> 18:46.533
A good portly man of faith.

18:52.403 --> 18:55.420
<i>Aye, to a cheerful look,
a pleasing eye...</i>

18:55.521 --> 18:59.319
<i>and a most noble carriage.</i>

19:06.652 --> 19:09.554
But do I not dwindle?

19:09.624 --> 19:13.524
My skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown.

19:16.773 --> 19:20.075
Company, villainous company
have been the spoil of me.

19:24.345 --> 19:26.175
- Whoo!
- Hey! Hey!

19:28.416 --> 19:31.679
I was as virtuous
as a gentleman need to be.

19:31.785 --> 19:35.320
Virtuous enough. Swore a little.

19:38.057 --> 19:41.522
Diced not above seven days a week.

19:43.194 --> 19:46.196
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in the quarter.

19:52.034 --> 19:55.300
Paid money that I borrowed,

19:55.388 --> 19:57.217
three or four times.

19:57.874 --> 20:00.643
Lived well and in good compass.

20:00.744 --> 20:04.233
What? You were so fat, Sir John,

20:04.303 --> 20:08.782
that you must indeed
be out of all compass.

20:08.811 --> 20:12.389
Do thou amend thy face,
and I'll amend my life.

20:27.633 --> 20:31.672
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked.

20:31.772 --> 20:36.277
Mmm? If to be old and merry is a sin,

20:36.324 --> 20:39.598
if to be fat is to be hated,

20:40.949 --> 20:45.219
then no, my good lord,
when thou art king,

20:46.035 --> 20:50.838
banish Pistol, banish Bardolph,
banish Nym.

20:52.580 --> 20:55.017
But sweet Jack Falstaff,

20:55.118 --> 20:57.390
Valiant Jack Falstaff,

20:57.491 --> 21:00.862
and therefore more valiant
being as he is,

21:00.963 --> 21:04.439
old Jack Falstaff,

21:04.468 --> 21:08.141
banish not him thy Harry's company.

21:09.095 --> 21:12.549
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

21:15.324 --> 21:19.455
<i>I do. I will.</i>

21:23.508 --> 21:28.640
But we have heard the
chimes at midnight, master Harry.

21:31.688 --> 21:33.589
Jesus.

21:35.798 --> 21:38.903
The days that we have seen.

21:40.106 --> 21:44.406
<i>I know thee not, old man.</i>

22:05.821 --> 22:09.257
The king hath run
bad humours on the knight.

22:10.765 --> 22:13.236
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.

22:14.751 --> 22:18.779
His heart is fracted
and... corroborate.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.299
The king's a good king,

22:23.517 --> 22:25.754
but it must be as it may.

22:26.162 --> 22:29.290
He passes some humours and careers.

22:29.969 --> 22:33.268
Let us condole the knight,

22:33.362 --> 22:37.674
for, Lambkins, we will live.

22:47.248 --> 22:49.908
The French, advised
by good intelligence...

22:50.009 --> 22:52.704
of this most dreadful preparation,

22:52.755 --> 22:54.704
shake in their fear...

22:54.737 --> 22:58.700
and with pale policy seek
to divert the English purposes.

22:59.567 --> 23:03.997
Oh, England, model
to thy inward greatness.

23:04.028 --> 23:06.997
Like a little body with a mighty heart.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.210
What mightst thou do
that honour would thee do...

23:09.311 --> 23:12.249
were all thy children kind and natural?

23:13.404 --> 23:17.059
But see, thy fault France
hath in thee found out.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.568
A nest of hollow bosoms which he
fills with treacherous crowns...

23:21.631 --> 23:24.039
and three corrupted men.

23:24.140 --> 23:25.877
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

23:25.978 --> 23:28.649
and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,

23:28.750 --> 23:32.189
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight,
of Northumberland,

23:32.289 --> 23:36.084
have for the gilt of France...
oh, guilt indeed...

23:36.163 --> 23:39.326
confirmed conspiracy
with fearful France,

23:39.350 --> 23:43.110
and by their hands
this grace of kings must die,

23:43.211 --> 23:45.048
ere he take ship for France.

23:45.149 --> 23:46.786
The traitors are agreed.

23:47.270 --> 23:49.605
The king is set from London,

23:49.651 --> 23:53.652
and the scene
is now transported, gentles,

23:53.715 --> 23:54.822
to Southampton.

24:07.177 --> 24:10.404
Before God, his grace is bold
to trust these traitors.

24:10.469 --> 24:12.435
They shall be apprehended by and by.

24:12.455 --> 24:15.154
How smooth and even
they do bear themselves,

24:15.201 --> 24:19.507
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

24:19.616 --> 24:23.708
The king hath note of all they intend by
interception which they dream not of.

24:23.716 --> 24:26.027
Nay, but the man
that was his bedfellow,

24:26.127 --> 24:28.798
whom he hath dulled and cloyed
with gracious favours...

24:28.899 --> 24:32.037
That he should, for a foreign purse,

24:32.138 --> 24:37.203
so sell his sovereign's life
to death and treachery.

24:43.402 --> 24:46.964
Now sits the wind fair,
and we will aboard.

24:53.497 --> 24:56.002
My lord of Cambridge
and my kind lord of Masham...

24:56.071 --> 24:59.215
and you, my gentle knight,
give me your thoughts.

24:59.395 --> 25:01.663
Think you not that
the powers we bear with us...

25:01.764 --> 25:04.356
will cut their passage
through the force of France?

25:04.403 --> 25:08.342
- No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
- I doubt not that.

25:08.443 --> 25:11.915
Never was monarch better feared
and loved than is your majesty.

25:11.959 --> 25:13.201
True.

25:13.318 --> 25:16.024
We therefore have great
cause of thankfulness.

25:16.125 --> 25:19.237
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the
man committed yesterday...

25:19.284 --> 25:21.220
that railed against our person.

25:21.243 --> 25:25.586
We consider it was excess of
wine that set him on,

25:25.663 --> 25:27.433
And on his more advice we pardon him.

25:27.456 --> 25:30.862
That's mercy, but too much security.

25:30.891 --> 25:36.066
Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example breed
by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

25:36.103 --> 25:39.937
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.444
So may your highness,
and yet punish too.

25:43.545 --> 25:45.983
Sir, you show great mercy
if you give him life...

25:46.084 --> 25:48.208
after the taste of much correction.

25:48.231 --> 25:51.960
Alas, your too much love
and care of me...

25:52.061 --> 25:55.248
are heavy orisons
against this poor wretch.

25:55.334 --> 26:00.476
If little faults proceeding on
distemper shall not be winked at,

26:00.537 --> 26:06.120
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes, chewed,

26:06.221 --> 26:09.714
swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

26:11.211 --> 26:13.669
We'll yet enlarge that man,

26:13.770 --> 26:16.674
though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey,

26:16.775 --> 26:20.149
in their dear care
and tender preservation...

26:20.195 --> 26:24.253
of our person would have him punished.

26:25.526 --> 26:28.621
And now to our French causes.

26:29.387 --> 26:31.778
- Who are the late commissioners?
- I one, my lord.

26:31.801 --> 26:34.251
- Your highness bade me ask for it today.
- So did you me, my liege.

26:34.297 --> 26:37.453
- And I, my lord sovereign.
- Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours.

26:37.531 --> 26:39.477
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham,

26:39.524 --> 26:42.725
and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.

26:42.826 --> 26:44.021
Read them...

26:44.330 --> 26:45.695
and know...

26:46.735 --> 26:50.170
I know your worthiness.

26:52.050 --> 26:55.418
My Lord of Westmorland,
uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.

27:00.372 --> 27:02.008
Why, how now, gentlemen

27:02.665 --> 27:06.305
what see you in those papers
that you lose so much complexion?

27:06.406 --> 27:09.912
I do confess my fault and do
submit me to your highness' mercy.

27:10.013 --> 27:13.748
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late...

27:13.779 --> 27:16.523
by your own counsel
is suppressed and killed.

27:16.624 --> 27:21.037
You must not dare for shame
to talk of mercy!

27:21.061 --> 27:27.071
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you.

27:37.395 --> 27:43.209
See you, my princes and my noble
peers, these English monsters.

27:43.309 --> 27:46.371
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop,

27:46.433 --> 27:49.598
thou cruel, ingrateful,

27:49.676 --> 27:52.934
savage and inhuman creature?

27:52.981 --> 27:55.395
Thou knave thou!

27:55.449 --> 27:59.207
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
that knewest the very bottom of my soul,

27:59.308 --> 28:01.444
that almost mightst have
coined me into gold,

28:01.545 --> 28:04.017
which thou have practised
on me for thy use.

28:04.118 --> 28:06.689
May it be possible that foreign hire...

28:06.790 --> 28:11.398
could out of thee extract one spark
of evil that might annoy my finger?

28:11.499 --> 28:14.474
'Tis so strange...

28:14.536 --> 28:17.777
that though the truth of it stand
off as gross as black and white,

28:17.878 --> 28:20.114
my eye will scarcely see it.

28:20.902 --> 28:26.996
So... constant and unspotted
didst thou seem...

28:27.009 --> 28:30.816
that this thy fall
hath left a kind of blot...

28:30.856 --> 28:33.379
to mark the full-fraught man...

28:33.410 --> 28:37.110
and best indued with some suspicion.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.610
I will weep for thee.

28:44.390 --> 28:49.909
For this revolt of thine, methinks,
is like another fall of man.

29:07.363 --> 29:12.126
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

29:13.667 --> 29:18.396
I arrest thee of high treason by the name
of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.

29:20.171 --> 29:24.970
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.

29:30.263 --> 29:31.854
Hear your sentence.

29:32.247 --> 29:34.481
You have conspired
against our royal person,

29:34.582 --> 29:37.050
joined with an enemy
proclaimed and from his coffers...

29:37.151 --> 29:40.334
received the golden earnest
of our death wherein.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.490
You would have sold your king
to slaughter,

29:42.534 --> 29:44.638
his princes and his peers to servitude,

29:44.689 --> 29:46.990
his subjects to oppression
and contempt...

29:47.069 --> 29:50.123
and his whole kingdom into desolation!

29:52.028 --> 29:57.807
Get you therefore hence, poor
miserable wretches, to your death,

29:57.845 --> 30:02.064
the taste whereof God of his mercy
give you patience to endure...

30:02.137 --> 30:06.619
and true repentance
of all your dear offences.

30:07.672 --> 30:08.865
Bear them hence.

30:16.746 --> 30:18.680
Now, Lords, for France,

30:18.781 --> 30:22.079
the enterprise whereof shall
be to you, as us, like glorious,

30:22.179 --> 30:26.981
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way.

30:27.831 --> 30:29.523
Cheerly to sea.

30:29.683 --> 30:31.547
The signs of war advance.

30:32.351 --> 30:37.250
No king of England
if not king of France.

31:19.894 --> 31:23.667
Prithee, honey-sweet husband,
let me bring thee to Staines.

31:23.695 --> 31:28.962
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.

31:29.894 --> 31:32.050
Bardolph, be blithe.

31:33.198 --> 31:36.830
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.

31:38.095 --> 31:42.401
Boy, bristle thy courage up.

31:42.449 --> 31:45.901
For Falstaff is dead,

31:45.995 --> 31:47.700
and we must yearn therefore.

31:47.801 --> 31:50.894
Would I were with him, wheresome'er
he is, either in heaven or in hell.

31:50.949 --> 31:52.691
Nay, sure, he's not in hell.

31:53.644 --> 31:57.244
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever
a man went to Arthur's bosom.

31:58.407 --> 32:02.096
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any Christian child.

32:05.171 --> 32:08.136
He parted even
just between 12:00 and 1:00,

32:09.743 --> 32:12.210
even at the turning of the tide.

32:13.574 --> 32:16.540
For after I saw him
fumble with the sheets...

32:16.641 --> 32:21.836
and play with flowers and
smile upon his finger's ends,

32:23.859 --> 32:26.134
I knew there was but one way.

32:28.543 --> 32:31.600
For his nose was as sharp as a pen,

32:33.845 --> 32:36.901
and he babbled of green fields.

32:37.979 --> 32:40.078
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.

32:40.179 --> 32:42.578
"What, man? Be of good cheer."

32:44.248 --> 32:48.441
So he cried out, "God, God,

32:50.483 --> 32:52.108
"God,"

32:53.228 --> 32:54.955
Three or four times.

32:57.986 --> 33:02.483
Now I, to comfort him, bid him
he should not think of God.

33:02.584 --> 33:06.277
I hoped there was no need to trouble
himself with any such thoughts yet.

33:10.085 --> 33:13.176
He bade me put
more clothes on his feet.

33:15.342 --> 33:17.774
I put my hand under the bed
and felt them,

33:20.688 --> 33:23.882
and they were as cold as any stone.

33:26.024 --> 33:28.748
Then I felt to his knees,

33:30.256 --> 33:35.315
and so upward... and upward,

33:39.260 --> 33:40.726
and all was as...

33:43.321 --> 33:45.309
cold as any stone.

33:52.063 --> 33:55.296
- They say he cried out for sack.
- That he did.

33:55.397 --> 33:57.464
And of women. No, that he did not.

33:57.565 --> 33:58.762
Yeah, that he did.

33:58.863 --> 34:02.065
He said they were... devils incarnate.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.563
He could never abide carnation.
It was a colour he never liked.

34:06.733 --> 34:09.337
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

34:09.447 --> 34:14.783
Well, he did in some sort...
handle women.

34:16.868 --> 34:20.101
But then he was rheumatic and
talked of the whore of Babylon.

34:21.078 --> 34:24.710
Do you not remember he saw a flea
stick upon Bardolph's nose?

34:24.817 --> 34:27.570
He said it was a black soul
burning in hell.

34:27.585 --> 34:31.155
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

34:31.232 --> 34:34.324
That's all the riches
I got in his service.

34:37.906 --> 34:39.270
Shall we shog?

34:40.672 --> 34:43.467
The king will be gone from Southampton.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.925
Farewell, hostess.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.739
I cannot kiss.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.579
That's the humour of it.

35:08.171 --> 35:09.398
But...

35:15.182 --> 35:16.579
Adieu.

35:31.519 --> 35:34.416
Let housewifery appear.

35:36.769 --> 35:38.115
Keep close.

35:40.587 --> 35:42.477
I thee command.

35:47.175 --> 35:48.572
Farewell.

36:00.258 --> 36:01.622
Adieu.

36:09.289 --> 36:12.389
<i>Follow, follow.</i>

36:12.435 --> 36:17.075
<i>For who is he whose chin is but
enriched with one appearing hair...</i>

36:17.137 --> 36:21.685
<i>that will not follow these
culled and choice-drawn cavaliers...</i>

36:21.731 --> 36:23.662
<i>to France?</i>

36:43.935 --> 36:49.231
Thus comes the English...
with full power upon us,

36:50.971 --> 36:56.163
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defences.

36:58.322 --> 37:01.223
Therefore, the dukes of Berri...

37:01.668 --> 37:03.191
and of Bretagne,

37:04.408 --> 37:08.221
of Brabant and of Orleans
shall make forth.

37:08.673 --> 37:10.473
And you, prince Dauphin...

37:10.528 --> 37:12.161
My most redoubted father,

37:13.168 --> 37:17.088
it is most meet we arm us
against the foe.

37:17.140 --> 37:19.562
For peace itself
should not so dull a kingdom,

37:19.610 --> 37:22.914
but the defences, musters,
preparations should be maintained,

37:22.969 --> 37:26.211
assembled and collected,
as were a war in expectation.

37:26.252 --> 37:29.266
Therefore, I say 'tis meet
we all go forth to view...

37:29.294 --> 37:31.996
the sick and feeble parts of France.

37:32.813 --> 37:35.219
And let us do it with no show of fear!

37:35.261 --> 37:38.313
No, with no more than if we heard
that England were busied with,

37:38.365 --> 37:41.085
uh, a Whitsun morris dance.

37:41.147 --> 37:45.794
For, my good liege, she is so idly
kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow,

37:45.834 --> 37:48.255
humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

37:48.295 --> 37:50.411
O peace, prince dauphin.

37:50.475 --> 37:53.374
You're too much mistaken in this king.

37:53.428 --> 37:56.366
Question, your grace,
the late ambassadors.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.374
With what great state
he heard their embassy,

37:59.406 --> 38:02.806
how well supplied
with noble counsellors,

38:02.861 --> 38:07.173
how modest in exception
and withal how terrible...

38:07.190 --> 38:09.666
in constant resolution.

38:14.224 --> 38:16.190
Well, 'tis not so,
my lord high constable.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.483
Though we think it so, 'tis no matter.

38:19.514 --> 38:23.015
In matters of defence, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

38:23.932 --> 38:26.189
Think we king Harry strong.

38:28.819 --> 38:33.344
And, princes, look you
strongly armed to meet him.

38:34.495 --> 38:37.906
For he is bred
out of that bloody strain...

38:37.929 --> 38:41.578
that haunted us in our familiar paths.

38:41.617 --> 38:45.219
Witness our too-much memorable shame...

38:45.250 --> 38:49.468
when Cressy Battle
fatally was struck...

38:49.501 --> 38:53.117
and all our princes captived...

38:53.137 --> 38:56.242
by the hand of that black name,

38:56.329 --> 38:57.624
Edward,

38:59.104 --> 39:02.662
black prince of Wales.

39:04.346 --> 39:09.721
This is a stem
of that victorious stalk.

39:09.768 --> 39:14.205
And let us fear
the native mightiness...

39:14.275 --> 39:16.158
and fate of him.

39:36.244 --> 39:40.642
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England,
do crave admittance to your majesty.

39:41.974 --> 39:44.600
Go and bring them.

39:47.130 --> 39:51.028
You see, this chase
is hotly followed, friends.

39:57.080 --> 40:01.046
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

40:01.147 --> 40:05.112
and let them know of what a
monarchy you are the head.

40:06.491 --> 40:11.949
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile
a sin as self-neglecting.

40:28.015 --> 40:30.810
From our brother England?

40:30.834 --> 40:35.774
From him, and thus
he greets your majesty.

40:36.001 --> 40:39.157
He wills you, in the
name of God almighty,

40:39.219 --> 40:42.133
that you divest yourself
and lay apart...

40:42.180 --> 40:44.961
the borrowed glories
that by gift of heaven,

40:45.047 --> 40:47.453
by law of nature and of nations,

40:47.514 --> 40:50.773
belongs to him and to his heirs.

40:50.807 --> 40:53.869
Namely, the crown.

40:54.550 --> 40:57.850
Willing you overlook this pedigree.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.532
And when you find him evenly derived...

41:01.568 --> 41:05.640
from his most famed of famous
ancestors, Edward the III,

41:05.671 --> 41:11.483
he bids you then resign your crown
and kingdom, indirectly held from him,

41:11.560 --> 41:14.756
the native and true challenger.

41:14.823 --> 41:17.986
Or else what follows?

41:19.097 --> 41:20.827
Bloody constraint.

41:21.591 --> 41:25.786
For if you hide the crown,
even in your hearts,

41:25.861 --> 41:28.465
there will he rake for it.

41:28.527 --> 41:31.843
Therefore, in fierce
tempest is he coming,

41:31.898 --> 41:35.640
in thunder and in earthquake,
like a Jove,

41:35.703 --> 41:39.902
that if requiring fail, he will compel.

41:40.419 --> 41:45.289
This is his claim,
his threatening and my message.

41:45.810 --> 41:48.981
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,

41:49.061 --> 41:51.766
to whom expressly I bring greeting to.

41:52.296 --> 41:55.070
For the Dauphin,

41:55.096 --> 41:57.620
I stand here for him.

42:03.823 --> 42:05.559
What to him from England?

42:05.926 --> 42:09.306
Scorn and defiance,

42:09.401 --> 42:13.306
slight regard, contempt...

42:13.367 --> 42:16.900
and anything that might not
misbecome the mighty sender,

42:16.947 --> 42:19.781
doth he prize you at.

42:19.867 --> 42:21.358
Thus says my king.

42:22.679 --> 42:26.304
Say, if my father render a fair
return, it is against my will,

42:26.400 --> 42:29.139
for I desire nothing
but odds with England.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.000
And to that end, as matching
to his youth and vanity,

42:33.055 --> 42:36.047
I did present him with the Paris balls!

42:36.086 --> 42:39.386
He'll make your Paris Louvre
shake for it.

42:39.875 --> 42:42.977
And be assured
you'll find a difference,

42:43.033 --> 42:45.759
as we, his subjects,
have in wonder found,

42:45.809 --> 42:50.043
between the promise of his greener
days and these he masters now.

42:51.010 --> 42:53.652
Tomorrow...

42:53.699 --> 42:57.371
shall you know our mind at full.

43:02.992 --> 43:05.896
<i>Thus with imagined wing
our swift scene flies,</i>

43:05.997 --> 43:10.596
<i>in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought!</i>

43:11.309 --> 43:14.981
Work, work your thoughts, and
in them see a siege!

43:15.027 --> 43:17.074
Behold the ordinance
on their carriages,

43:17.117 --> 43:20.152
with fatal mouths gaping
on girded Harflew.

43:21.530 --> 43:23.500
Suppose the ambassador
from the French comes back,

43:23.601 --> 43:26.237
tells Harry that the king does
offer him Katherine, his daughter,

43:26.338 --> 43:29.659
and with her to dowry, some
petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

43:29.721 --> 43:31.690
The offer likes him not.

43:31.728 --> 43:35.120
And the nimble gunner with linstock
now the devilish cannon touches,

43:35.183 --> 43:37.995
and down goes all before them!

43:48.616 --> 43:51.253
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!

43:51.354 --> 43:55.964
Once more, or close the wall up
with our English dead!

44:06.418 --> 44:10.125
In peace there's nothing so becomes a
man as modest stillness and humility.

44:10.226 --> 44:12.531
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

44:12.632 --> 44:15.181
then imitate the action of the tiger!

44:15.236 --> 44:17.008
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

44:17.109 --> 44:19.876
disguise fair nature
with hard-favored rage.

44:19.962 --> 44:22.228
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.022
Let it pry through the portage of
the head like the brass cannon.

44:25.054 --> 44:28.427
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as
fearfully as doth a galled rock...

44:28.528 --> 44:30.532
o'erhang and jetty his confounded base,

44:30.633 --> 44:32.803
swilled with the wild
and wasteful ocean.

44:32.904 --> 44:36.208
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

44:36.309 --> 44:41.788
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height!

44:41.889 --> 44:45.194
On, on, you noblest England!

44:49.770 --> 44:50.934
Dishonour not your mothers.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.412
Now attest that those whom you
called fathers did beget you.

44:54.512 --> 44:57.920
And you, good yeoman, whose
limbs were made in England,

44:58.021 --> 44:59.790
show us here the mettle
of your pasture.

44:59.891 --> 45:03.999
Let us swear that you are worth
your breeding, which I doubt not!

45:04.100 --> 45:09.717
For there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

45:09.749 --> 45:13.871
I see you stand like greyhounds in
the slips, straining upon the start.

45:13.913 --> 45:16.523
The game's afoot! Follow your spirit,

45:16.561 --> 45:20.966
and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,

45:21.067 --> 45:25.163
"England and Saint George!"

45:25.225 --> 45:32.209
God for harry,
England and Saint George!

45:40.205 --> 45:45.009
Up to the breach, you dogs!

45:45.715 --> 45:49.379
Avaunt, you cullions!

45:58.441 --> 46:01.213
Captain Fluellen, you must
come presently to the mines.

46:01.313 --> 46:03.517
The duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

46:03.618 --> 46:06.457
Tell the duke it is not so good
to come to the mines.

46:06.917 --> 46:10.386
For look you, the mines is not
according to the disciplines of war.

46:10.431 --> 46:13.761
By Cheshu, I think he will blow up all,

46:13.808 --> 46:17.201
if there is not better direction.

46:17.448 --> 46:19.533
The duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order...

46:19.583 --> 46:24.216
of the siege is given, is altogether
directed by an Irishman.

46:25.203 --> 46:26.836
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?

46:26.914 --> 46:31.352
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.

46:31.414 --> 46:32.807
He has no more directions...

46:32.908 --> 46:37.143
in the true disciplines of the
wars than is a puppy dog.

46:37.806 --> 46:40.725
Here he comes, and the Scots
captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

46:40.826 --> 46:44.831
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvellous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

46:44.932 --> 46:48.755
I say... good day, Captain Fluellen.

46:48.809 --> 46:50.701
Good day to your worship,
good Captain James.

46:50.748 --> 46:53.255
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines?

46:53.264 --> 46:55.037
By Christ, la.

46:55.130 --> 46:56.461
The workish give over.

46:56.492 --> 46:58.060
The trumpets sound the retreat.

46:58.708 --> 47:01.111
By my hand, 'tis ill done.

47:01.156 --> 47:04.128
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,

47:04.238 --> 47:07.612
a few disputations as partly
touching the disciplines of the war,

47:07.658 --> 47:10.058
partly to satisfy my opinion...

47:10.109 --> 47:12.912
and partly for
the satisfaction of my mind,

47:12.957 --> 47:16.402
as touching the direction of the
military discipline. That is the point.

47:16.438 --> 47:18.460
It is no time to discourse,
so Christ save me.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.904
The town is besieged, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach.

47:21.005 --> 47:23.409
We talk, and, by Christ, do nothing.

47:23.510 --> 47:26.684
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine
take themselves to slumber,

47:26.785 --> 47:31.058
I'll do good service, or I'll
lie in the ground for it.

47:31.159 --> 47:33.061
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you,

47:33.162 --> 47:35.935
under your correction, there
are not many of your nation.

47:38.067 --> 47:39.700
What is my nation?

47:39.810 --> 47:41.575
Who talks of my nation is a villain...

47:41.606 --> 47:45.553
and a bastard and a knave and a rascal?

47:45.654 --> 47:49.863
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
than it is meant, Captain Macmorris,

47:49.964 --> 47:52.035
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me...

47:52.136 --> 47:57.711
with that affability as in discretion
you ought to use me, now look you,

47:57.758 --> 48:00.305
being as good a man as yourself.

48:00.355 --> 48:03.453
I do not know you
so good a man as myself.

48:03.501 --> 48:07.440
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!

48:33.792 --> 48:36.920
How yet resolves
the governor of the town?

48:37.683 --> 48:41.152
This is the latest parle we will admit.

48:41.465 --> 48:44.203
Therefore, to our best mercy
give yourselves,

48:44.304 --> 48:48.868
or, like to men proud of
destruction, defy us to our worst.

48:49.434 --> 48:52.324
For as I am a soldier, if I
begin the battery once again,

48:52.356 --> 48:55.223
I will not leave
the half-achieved Harflew...

48:55.278 --> 48:58.340
till in her ashes she lie buried.

48:58.599 --> 49:01.104
Therefore, you men of Harflew,

49:01.205 --> 49:04.608
take pity of your town
and of your people...

49:04.631 --> 49:07.870
whiles yet my soldiers
are in my command,

49:07.916 --> 49:11.365
whiles yet the cool
and temperate wind of grace...

49:11.418 --> 49:15.459
o'erblows the filthy
and contagious clouds...

49:15.506 --> 49:20.389
of heady murder, spoil and villainy!

49:20.428 --> 49:25.052
If not, why, in a moment look to see...

49:25.153 --> 49:29.060
the blind and bloody
soldier with foul hand...

49:29.161 --> 49:32.634
defile the locks of your shrill,
shrieking daughters,

49:32.735 --> 49:35.203
your fathers taken
by their silvered beards...

49:35.242 --> 49:38.649
and their most reverend heads
dashed to the walls,

49:38.684 --> 49:42.399
your naked infants
spitted upon pikes...

49:42.475 --> 49:47.317
whiles the mad mothers
with their howls confused...

49:47.417 --> 49:49.910
do break the clouds!

49:50.357 --> 49:51.994
What say you?

49:52.240 --> 49:57.166
Will you yield and this avoid?

49:57.214 --> 50:00.768
Or, guilty in defence,

50:00.831 --> 50:03.129
be thus destroyed?

50:03.935 --> 50:07.432
The Dauphin, of whose
succour we entreated,

50:07.475 --> 50:13.454
returns us that his powers are not
yet ready to raise so great a siege.

50:14.063 --> 50:17.373
Therefore, dread king,

50:17.419 --> 50:22.815
enter our gates,
dispose of us and ours,

50:24.551 --> 50:27.608
for we no longer are defensible.

50:55.973 --> 50:58.471
Go you and enter Harflew.

50:58.518 --> 51:02.651
There remain and fortify it
strongly against the French.

51:02.689 --> 51:06.780
Use... mercy to them all.

51:09.681 --> 51:13.619
For us, dear uncle,
the winter coming on...

51:13.666 --> 51:16.283
and sickness growing upon our soldiers,

51:16.339 --> 51:19.916
we will retire to Calais.

51:22.066 --> 51:26.457
Tonight... in Harflew
will we be your guest.

51:26.498 --> 51:31.378
Tomorrow... for the march
are we addressed.

51:56.022 --> 51:57.249
Alice.

52:07.415 --> 52:09.749
Alice, you've been in England

52:09.795 --> 52:11.995
and you speak the language well.

52:12.222 --> 52:13.780
A bit, madame.

52:14.787 --> 52:16.976
I beg you, teach me.

52:17.689 --> 52:19.690
I need to learn to speak it.

52:21.564 --> 52:23.470
How do you call a hand in English?

52:23.500 --> 52:27.230
The hand? It's called "the hand".

52:28.067 --> 52:29.410
"The hand."

52:31.705 --> 52:32.783
And the fingers?

52:32.828 --> 52:36.194
The fingers? My, I've
forgotten the fingers.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.640
But I'll remember. The fingers?

52:38.774 --> 52:42.305
I think those are called "the fingres".

52:44.612 --> 52:49.674
The hand: "the hand".
The fingers: "the fingres".

52:52.036 --> 52:53.441
I think I'm a good pupil.

52:53.465 --> 52:56.402
I've learned two English
words very quickly.

52:56.461 --> 52:59.059
- How would you call the nails?
- The nails?

52:59.101 --> 53:02.046
We call those "the nails".

53:02.070 --> 53:03.660
"The nails".

53:05.764 --> 53:08.263
Listen. Tell me if I speak it correctly.

53:08.279 --> 53:13.439
"The hand, the fingres" and "the nails".

53:13.478 --> 53:17.604
That's well said, madame.
You're good at English.

53:18.395 --> 53:20.395
Tell me the English word for the arms.

53:20.550 --> 53:22.717
- "Th'arm", madame.
- And the elbow?

53:24.014 --> 53:25.913
"Th'elbow".

53:26.124 --> 53:27.522
"Th'elbow".

53:29.099 --> 53:33.919
I'll practice all words that you've taught me now.

53:33.950 --> 53:36.587
I think it's very difficult, madame.

53:36.689 --> 53:40.524
Excuse me, Alice. Listen:
"The hand, the fingres,"

53:40.548 --> 53:44.304
- "the nails, the arma, the bilbow."
- "Th'elbow", madame.

53:44.336 --> 53:47.600
Oh, Lord God, I've forgotten. "Th'elbow".

53:48.109 --> 53:49.609
How do you call the neck, madame?

53:50.101 --> 53:51.750
"The nick", madame.

53:51.793 --> 53:53.784
- "The nick."
- Mmm.

53:54.113 --> 53:58.097
- And the chin?
- "The chin".

53:58.927 --> 54:00.984
"The chin".

54:01.133 --> 54:02.827
The neck: "The nick".

54:02.861 --> 54:06.109
The chin: "The chin".

54:06.170 --> 54:08.944
Yes, except your honour, in truth

54:08.972 --> 54:12.461
you also pronounce the words correctly
like a true English native.

54:12.486 --> 54:15.879
I don't doubt that I'll learn it, by
the grace of God, and quickly too.

54:15.918 --> 54:19.379
Haven't you already forgotten what I taught you?

54:19.419 --> 54:21.723
No, I'll recite it to you promptly:

54:21.757 --> 54:25.707
"The hand, the fingres."

54:25.746 --> 54:28.839
- "The mails"?
- "The nails", madame.

54:28.906 --> 54:30.324
"The nails, madame."

54:30.354 --> 54:34.853
- "The arma, de bolbow."
- But your honour, "th'elbow".

54:34.903 --> 54:37.924
That's what I said. "Th'elbow, the nick".

54:37.974 --> 54:40.669
And "the chin".

54:41.935 --> 54:44.570
How do you call the feet and the gown?

54:45.242 --> 54:49.216
The "foot" <i>(fuck)</i>, madame, and the "coun" <i>(cunt)</i>.

54:50.875 --> 54:53.390
- "Foot" and the "coun"?
- Mmm.

54:56.255 --> 54:57.983
Oh Lord God!

54:58.773 --> 55:02.543
Those are bad words to make a mistake with.

55:02.554 --> 55:06.195
Coarse, and imprudent for use by ladies.

55:06.234 --> 55:10.538
I don't want to pronounce those words in front
of the lords of France or the whole world.

55:10.585 --> 55:13.789
The "foot" and the "coun".

55:18.642 --> 55:23.668
Nonetheless, I'll recite
my lesson once again.

55:23.699 --> 55:26.332
"The hand, the fingres,"

55:26.372 --> 55:30.254
"the nails, the arma, the..."

55:30.278 --> 55:34.581
"The nick, the chin, the
foot and the coun!"

55:58.541 --> 56:02.910
'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.

56:03.012 --> 56:08.100
And if he be not fought withal,
my lord, let us not live in France.

56:08.155 --> 56:11.647
Normans. But bastard Normans!

56:11.697 --> 56:13.926
Norman... bastards!

56:13.988 --> 56:18.277
Where have they this mettle? Is not
their climate foggy, raw and dull?

56:18.332 --> 56:20.893
- O, for honour of our land.
- By faith and honour,

56:20.994 --> 56:26.192
our madams mock at us and
plainly say our mettle is bred out!

56:28.333 --> 56:32.637
And they will give their bodies
to the lust of English youth...

56:32.738 --> 56:37.605
to new-store France
with bastard warriors!

56:38.608 --> 56:42.077
Where is Montjoy, the herald?

56:42.580 --> 56:44.564
Speed him hence.

56:45.605 --> 56:50.022
Let him greet England
with our sharp defiance.

56:50.437 --> 56:51.897
Up, princes,

56:52.108 --> 56:56.483
and with spirit of honour edged
more sharper than your swords,

56:56.584 --> 56:58.243
hie to the field.

57:00.068 --> 57:02.500
Bar Harry England,

57:03.284 --> 57:05.302
that sweeps through our land...

57:05.325 --> 57:08.623
with pennons painted
in the blood of Harflew.

57:09.747 --> 57:14.020
Go down upon him.
You have power enough.

57:14.054 --> 57:19.508
And in a captive chariot into
Rouen bring him our prisoner.

57:20.786 --> 57:23.654
This becomes the great.

57:23.942 --> 57:26.309
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,

57:26.394 --> 57:29.365
his soldiers sick and famished
in their march.

57:29.427 --> 57:31.997
For I am sure when he
shall see our army,

57:32.061 --> 57:35.388
he'll drop his heart
into the sink of fear...

57:35.411 --> 57:38.277
and, for achievement,
offer us his ransom.

57:38.502 --> 57:44.362
Therefore, lord constable,
haste on Montjoy.

57:45.238 --> 57:50.603
Prince Dauphin,
you shall stay with us in Rouen.

57:50.658 --> 57:52.808
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

57:52.863 --> 57:56.829
Be patient, for you
shall remain with us!

57:58.611 --> 58:02.838
Now forth, lord constable
and princes all,

58:02.886 --> 58:07.248
and quickly bring us word
of England's fall.

59:28.177 --> 59:30.032
Come. Come in.

59:36.145 --> 59:37.304
Captain Fluellen?

59:38.845 --> 59:41.548
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?

59:41.587 --> 59:44.811
He is not...
God be praised and blessed...

59:44.912 --> 59:50.437
any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.

59:51.524 --> 59:56.546
Captain! I thee beseech
to do me favours.

59:57.647 --> 01:00:00.212
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

01:00:00.313 --> 01:00:04.681
Aye, I praise God, and I have
merited some love at his hands.

01:00:04.782 --> 01:00:08.164
Bardolph, a soldier firm
and sound of heart...

01:00:08.196 --> 01:00:10.221
and buxom valour,

01:00:10.252 --> 01:00:16.050
hath by cruel fate and giddy
fortune's furious, fickle wheel...

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:19.897
Touching your patience, Ancient Pistol,

01:00:20.162 --> 01:00:23.242
fortune is an excellent moral.

01:00:23.289 --> 01:00:27.266
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
and frowns on him...

01:00:27.312 --> 01:00:31.820
for he hath stolen a pax
and hanged must he be.

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:34.741
Therefore, go speak.

01:00:36.163 --> 01:00:38.213
The duke will hear thy voice.

01:00:39.854 --> 01:00:43.713
Speak, captain, for his life,

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.128
and I will thee requite.

01:00:46.329 --> 01:00:50.367
Ancient Pistol, I do partly
understand your meaning.

01:00:50.468 --> 01:00:54.197
Why, then, rejoice therefore!

01:00:54.505 --> 01:00:57.835
'Tis not a thing to rejoice at.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.522
Look you, if he were my brother,

01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:04.001
I would desire the duke
to do his good pleasure...

01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:07.380
and put him to execution.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.710
Discipline ought to be used.

01:01:12.244 --> 01:01:14.591
Then die and be damned...

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.492
and figo for thy friendship!

01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:36.347
How now, Fluellen,
comest thou from the bridge?

01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:38.115
Aye, so please your majesty.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.810
The duke of Exeter hath very
gallantly maintained the bridge.

01:01:43.288 --> 01:01:46.123
What men have you lost, Fluellen?

01:01:46.223 --> 01:01:49.215
I think the duke
hath lost never a man...

01:01:53.232 --> 01:01:57.223
but one that is like to be
executed for robbing a church.

01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:02.430
One Bardolph, if
your majesty know the man.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:06.987
His face is all bubukles and
whelks and knobs and flames of fire.

01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:09.281
And his lips blows at his nose.

01:02:09.382 --> 01:02:13.078
'Tis like a coal of fire...
sometimes blue, sometimes red.

01:02:15.056 --> 01:02:18.683
But his nose is executed
and his fire's out.

01:02:23.327 --> 01:02:24.624
Get up!

01:03:09.979 --> 01:03:15.177
Do not, when thou art king,
hang a thief.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.282
No,

01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:24.689
thou shalt.

01:03:59.399 --> 01:04:02.867
We would have all such offenders
so cut off.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:07.305
And we give express charge
that in our marches...

01:04:07.406 --> 01:04:12.554
through the country there be nothing
compelled from the villages,

01:04:12.577 --> 01:04:15.376
nothing taken but paid for,

01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:21.474
none of the French upbraided
or abused in disdainful language.

01:04:23.044 --> 01:04:26.840
For when lenity and cruelty
play for a kingdom,

01:04:28.303 --> 01:04:33.754
the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:01.362
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:04.110
"though we seemed dead,
we did but sleep.

01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:06.832
"Tell him we could have
rebuked him at Harflew.

01:05:06.933 --> 01:05:11.077
"Now we speak,
and our voice is imperial.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:13.723
"England shall repent his folly.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.695
"Bid him, therefore,
consider of his ransom...

01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:18.647
"which must proportion
the losses we have borne...

01:05:18.702 --> 01:05:22.850
"which in weight to re-answer
his pettiness would bow under.

01:05:22.897 --> 01:05:26.608
"To this add defiance,
and tell him, for conclusion,

01:05:26.655 --> 01:05:28.530
"he hath betrayed his followers...

01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:31.548
"whose condemnation is pronounced."

01:05:32.093 --> 01:05:36.551
So far my king and master,
so much my office.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:40.735
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:44.616
Thou dost thy office fairly.

01:05:44.906 --> 01:05:48.500
Turn thee back, and tell
thy king I do not seek him now,

01:05:48.562 --> 01:05:52.578
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:56.373
Go, therefore,
tell thy master here I am.

01:05:56.412 --> 01:05:59.623
My ransom is this
frail and worthless trunk,

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:02.691
my army but a weak and sickly guard.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.417
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

01:06:06.479 --> 01:06:10.901
though France himself and such
another neighbour stand in our way.

01:06:11.002 --> 01:06:13.103
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:16.172
The sum of all our answer is but this:

01:06:16.954 --> 01:06:20.686
We would not seek a battle as we are,

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:24.510
nor, as we are,
we say we will not shun it.

01:06:27.507 --> 01:06:29.030
So tell your master.

01:06:30.893 --> 01:06:32.417
I shall deliver so.

01:06:33.151 --> 01:06:35.845
Thanks to your majesty.

01:06:54.279 --> 01:06:56.447
I hope they will not come upon us now.

01:06:56.548 --> 01:07:00.984
We are in god's hand, brother,
not in theirs.

01:07:16.101 --> 01:07:17.788
March to the bridge.

01:07:17.843 --> 01:07:20.272
It now draws towards night.

01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:23.405
Beyond the river
we'll encamp ourselves...

01:07:24.075 --> 01:07:25.736
and on tomorrow...

01:07:27.776 --> 01:07:32.237
bid them march away.

01:08:25.657 --> 01:08:28.745
Now entertain conjecture of a time...

01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:33.064
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark...

01:08:33.126 --> 01:08:36.040
fills the wide vessel of the universe.

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:41.242
From camp to camp through
the foul womb of night...

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:44.662
the hum of either army stilly sounds...

01:08:44.679 --> 01:08:47.069
that the fixed sentinels
almost receive...

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.898
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

01:08:49.966 --> 01:08:51.524
Fire answers fire,

01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:54.502
and through their paly flames,

01:08:54.517 --> 01:08:57.180
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

01:08:57.211 --> 01:09:00.112
Steed threatens steed
in high and boastful neighs,

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.921
piercing the night's dull ear.

01:09:03.303 --> 01:09:05.362
And from the tents,

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:08.296
the armourers,
accomplishing the knights,

01:09:08.341 --> 01:09:13.685
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:17.693
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

01:09:17.724 --> 01:09:19.473
the confident and over-lusty French...

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.200
do the low-rated English
play at dice...

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:26.715
and chide the cripple,
tardy-gaited night...

01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:32.156
who, like a foul and ugly witch,
doth limp so tediously away.

01:09:48.995 --> 01:09:52.868
I have the best armour in the world.

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.789
Would it were day.

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:58.730
You have an excellent armour,
but let my horse have his due.

01:09:59.774 --> 01:10:02.674
It is the best horse of Europe.

01:10:05.515 --> 01:10:07.649
Will it never be morning?

01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:11.909
My lord of Orleans
and my lord High Constable,

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:15.914
you talk of horse and armour?

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:20.694
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.016
I will not change my horse...

01:10:23.058 --> 01:10:26.687
for any that treads but on four hooves.

01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:29.994
When I bestride him, I soar.

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:35.669
I am a hawk, and he is
pure air and fire!

01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:38.719
And the dull elements of earth
and water never appear in him,

01:10:38.773 --> 01:10:43.277
but only impatient stillness
while his rider mounts him.

01:10:43.316 --> 01:10:48.580
Indeed, my lord, it is a most
absolute and excellent horse.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.605
My lord constable,
the armour in your tent tonight...

01:10:54.646 --> 01:10:56.470
Are those suns or stars on it?

01:10:56.522 --> 01:10:58.888
Stars, Montjoy.

01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:01.517
Some of them will
fall tomorrow, I hope.

01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:04.497
And yet my sky shall not want.

01:11:08.553 --> 01:11:10.815
Will it never be day?

01:11:13.111 --> 01:11:15.327
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

01:11:15.428 --> 01:11:18.729
and my way shall be paved
with English faces.

01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:24.493
I will not say so, for fear I
should be faced out of my way.

01:11:32.561 --> 01:11:34.152
I'll go arm myself.

01:11:42.954 --> 01:11:47.625
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.

01:11:47.726 --> 01:11:49.594
I think he will eat all he kills.

01:11:49.999 --> 01:11:54.400
- He never did harm that I heard of.
- Nor will do none tomorrow.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:58.263
Would it were day.

01:11:59.338 --> 01:12:03.431
Alas, poor Harry of England.

01:12:04.211 --> 01:12:07.813
He longs not for the dawning as we do.

01:12:08.054 --> 01:12:11.284
If the English had any apprehension,
they would run away.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.781
That island of England
breeds very valiant creatures.

01:12:24.866 --> 01:12:27.147
Now is it time to arm.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.503
Come, shall we about it?

01:12:29.604 --> 01:12:31.367
It is now 2 o'clock.

01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:36.241
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall
have each a hundred Englishmen.

01:12:41.582 --> 01:12:44.685
The poor, condemned English,

01:12:45.582 --> 01:12:47.550
like sacrifices,

01:12:47.623 --> 01:12:52.167
by their watchful fires
sit patiently...

01:12:52.222 --> 01:12:55.927
and inly ruminate the morning's danger.

01:13:05.842 --> 01:13:07.676
And their gesture sad,

01:13:07.777 --> 01:13:13.099
investing lank, lean cheeks
and war-worn coats,

01:13:13.169 --> 01:13:16.764
presenteth them unto the gazing moon...

01:13:16.786 --> 01:13:19.621
so many horrid ghosts.

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:54.491
Oh, now,

01:13:55.594 --> 01:13:59.858
who will behold the royal
captain of this ruined band,

01:14:00.373 --> 01:14:04.501
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent?

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:09.110
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"

01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:14.478
For forth he goes
and visits all his host.

01:14:14.579 --> 01:14:17.816
Bids them good morrow
with a modest smile...

01:14:18.424 --> 01:14:23.448
and calls them "Brothers,
friends and countrymen".

01:14:23.489 --> 01:14:27.092
A largesse universal, like the sun...

01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:30.319
his liberal eye doth give to everyone,

01:14:30.495 --> 01:14:33.088
thawing cold fear...

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:36.371
that mean and gentle all...

01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:40.432
behold, as may unworthiness define,

01:14:40.487 --> 01:14:43.505
a little touch of Harry in the night.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.878
Good morrow, old sir Thomas Erpingham.

01:14:46.979 --> 01:14:51.183
A good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of France.

01:14:51.284 --> 01:14:55.255
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better...

01:14:55.754 --> 01:14:59.190
since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:03.089
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

01:15:04.198 --> 01:15:06.800
Brothers both, commend me
to the princes in our camp.

01:15:06.901 --> 01:15:10.470
Do my good morrow to them, and
anon desire them all to my pavilion.

01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:11.731
We shall, my liege.

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:20.305
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.850
I and my bosom must debate a while,

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.680
and then I would no other company.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:30.949
The lord in heaven
bless thee, noble Harry.

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:39.293
God have mercy, old heart.

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:42.566
Thou speakest cheerfully.

01:15:52.605 --> 01:15:54.504
Who goes there?

01:15:55.185 --> 01:15:56.675
A friend.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.053
Discuss unto me.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.925
Art thou officer...

01:16:03.138 --> 01:16:06.589
or art thou base, common and popular?

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.693
I am a gentleman of a company.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:13.803
- Trailest thou the puissant pike?
- Even so.

01:16:13.904 --> 01:16:18.242
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

01:16:18.343 --> 01:16:21.332
Ah, then you are a better
than the king.

01:16:22.714 --> 01:16:27.672
The king's a bawcock
and a heart of gold,

01:16:27.853 --> 01:16:31.021
a lad of life, an imp of fame,

01:16:31.122 --> 01:16:35.057
of parents good, of fist most valiant.

01:16:36.627 --> 01:16:39.390
I kiss his dirty shoe,

01:16:39.664 --> 01:16:43.930
and from heart string,
I love the lovely bully.

01:16:48.407 --> 01:16:49.782
What is thy name?

01:16:50.953 --> 01:16:53.812
Uh, Harry Le Roy. Le Roy?

01:16:54.522 --> 01:16:56.657
A... a Cornish name?

01:16:56.719 --> 01:16:58.414
No, I am a Welshman.

01:17:00.722 --> 01:17:04.090
- Knowest thou Fluellen?
- Aye.

01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:08.878
Tell him I'll knock his leek about
his pate upon Saint Davy's day.

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:13.393
Well, do not wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

01:17:14.177 --> 01:17:15.596
Art thou his friend?

01:17:15.612 --> 01:17:18.026
And his kinsman too.

01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.641
- The figo with thee then.
- I thank you.

01:17:21.742 --> 01:17:22.868
God be with you.

01:17:23.876 --> 01:17:26.746
My name is Pistol called.

01:17:26.847 --> 01:17:29.814
It sorts well with your fierceness.

01:17:36.357 --> 01:17:38.880
Captain Fluellen.

01:17:41.696 --> 01:17:44.391
In the name of Jesus Christ,
speak lower.

01:17:49.703 --> 01:17:53.763
If you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the great,

01:17:53.826 --> 01:17:59.770
you shall find, I warned you, that there is no
Tiddle Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.

01:17:59.914 --> 01:18:02.848
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.

01:18:03.619 --> 01:18:07.223
If the enemy is an ass and
a fool and a prating coxcomb,

01:18:07.324 --> 01:18:09.624
is it meet that we should
also be an ass...

01:18:09.725 --> 01:18:14.388
and a fool and a prating coxcomb
in your conscience now?

01:18:15.798 --> 01:18:18.299
I will speak lower.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.494
I pray you and beseech you
that you will.

01:18:49.633 --> 01:18:51.066
Brother John Bates,

01:18:52.536 --> 01:18:55.572
Is not that the morning
which breaks yonder?

01:18:55.673 --> 01:18:56.935
I think it be,

01:18:57.341 --> 01:19:02.071
but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:05.410
We see yonder the beginning of the day,

01:19:06.685 --> 01:19:09.154
but I think we shall
never see the end of it.

01:19:12.626 --> 01:19:17.027
- Who goes there?
- A friend.

01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:19.446
Under what captain serve ya?

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:23.151
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

01:19:27.874 --> 01:19:32.308
A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

01:19:33.462 --> 01:19:37.363
I pray ya, what thinks he
of our estate?

01:19:37.517 --> 01:19:40.587
Even as men wrecked upon a sand...

01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:43.883
that look to be washed off
with the next tide.

01:19:44.325 --> 01:19:46.326
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

01:19:46.427 --> 01:19:50.088
No, nor it is not meet he should.

01:19:50.431 --> 01:19:53.333
I think the king is but a man as I am.

01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:56.800
The violet smells to him
as it doth to me.

01:19:56.836 --> 01:19:59.071
His ceremonies laid by,

01:19:59.172 --> 01:20:02.003
in his nakedness he appears but a man.

01:20:02.109 --> 01:20:04.611
Therefore, when he sees
reason to fear, as we do,

01:20:04.712 --> 01:20:07.814
his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

01:20:07.915 --> 01:20:10.651
He may show what
outward courage he will,

01:20:10.752 --> 01:20:12.852
but I believe as
cold a night as 'tis...

01:20:12.953 --> 01:20:16.155
that he could wish himself
in Thames up to the neck.

01:20:16.256 --> 01:20:20.315
And so I would he were, and I by him.

01:20:20.762 --> 01:20:23.854
At all adventures,
so we were quit here.

01:20:24.332 --> 01:20:27.668
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere but where he is.

01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:30.499
Then I would he were here alone.

01:20:32.642 --> 01:20:35.309
Methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented...

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:37.379
as in the king's company,

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.279
his cause being just
and his quarrel honourable.

01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:44.618
That's more than we know.

01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:46.786
Aye, and more than
we should seek after.

01:20:46.887 --> 01:20:50.238
We know enough if we know
we are the king's subject.

01:20:50.308 --> 01:20:53.024
If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king...

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:55.987
wipes the crime of it out of us.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.552
But if the cause be not good,

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:04.628
the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make.

01:21:04.998 --> 01:21:09.064
And all those legs and arms and
heads chopped off in the battle...

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:13.201
will join together at
the latter day and cry all,

01:21:14.278 --> 01:21:17.030
"we died at such a place."

01:21:18.304 --> 01:21:23.286
Some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

01:21:23.348 --> 01:21:26.340
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

01:21:26.441 --> 01:21:29.331
some upon the debts they owe,

01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:32.435
some upon their children rawly left.

01:21:37.966 --> 01:21:40.833
I'm afeared there are few die well...

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:43.264
that die in a battle...

01:21:43.287 --> 01:21:46.912
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything...

01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:49.352
when blood is their argument?

01:21:50.696 --> 01:21:55.024
Now if these men do not die well,

01:21:55.117 --> 01:21:59.980
it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it.

01:22:00.027 --> 01:22:03.529
So if a son that is by his father
sent about merchandise...

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:06.064
do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:09.157
the imputation of
his wickedness, by your rule,

01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:12.000
should be imposed upon
the father that sent him?

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.464
But this is not so.

01:22:14.057 --> 01:22:18.245
The king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers...

01:22:18.308 --> 01:22:20.511
nor the father of his son,

01:22:20.525 --> 01:22:24.583
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:30.575
Besides, there is no king,
be his cause never so spotless,

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:35.042
can try it out with
all unspotted soldiers.

01:22:36.214 --> 01:22:39.147
Every subject's duty is the king's,

01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:44.615
but every subject's soul is his own.

01:22:51.682 --> 01:22:53.148
'Tis certain.

01:22:53.956 --> 01:22:57.856
Every man that dies ill,
the ill upon his own head.

01:22:58.527 --> 01:23:00.738
The king is not to answer it.

01:23:00.769 --> 01:23:04.350
I do not desire
he should answer for me.

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:08.051
And yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.

01:23:08.096 --> 01:23:10.756
I myself heard the king say
he would not be ransomed.

01:23:10.788 --> 01:23:14.367
Aye, he said so
to make us fight cheerfully.

01:23:14.468 --> 01:23:18.225
But when our throats are cut, he may
be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.

01:23:18.288 --> 01:23:21.632
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:23.788
You pay him then!

01:23:27.174 --> 01:23:30.368
You'll never trust his word after?

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:34.277
Come. 'Tis a foolish saying.

01:23:34.378 --> 01:23:36.612
Your reproof is something too round.

01:23:36.713 --> 01:23:38.813
I should be angry with you
if time were convenient.

01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:42.246
Let it be a quarrel between us,
if you live!

01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:44.950
Be friends,
you English fools! Be friends!

01:23:45.051 --> 01:23:47.415
We have French quarrels enough!

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:08.857
Upon the king.

01:24:10.066 --> 01:24:14.999
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts,

01:24:15.336 --> 01:24:18.972
our careful wives, our children...

01:24:19.035 --> 01:24:22.194
and our sins lay on the king.

01:24:22.637 --> 01:24:24.933
We must bear all.

01:24:25.934 --> 01:24:29.004
Oh, hard condition.

01:24:29.848 --> 01:24:32.509
Twin-born with greatness,

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:36.009
subject to the breath of every fool.

01:24:36.379 --> 01:24:39.447
What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect...

01:24:39.548 --> 01:24:42.207
that private men enjoy?

01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:47.039
And what have kings
that privates have not too...

01:24:47.094 --> 01:24:48.821
save ceremony?

01:24:49.486 --> 01:24:53.318
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:58.896
What drinks thou oft instead of
homage sweet but poison flattery?

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:04.253
Oh, be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

01:25:04.294 --> 01:25:07.780
Canst thou, when thou
commandest the beggar's knee,

01:25:07.835 --> 01:25:10.496
command the health of it?

01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:22.365
No, thou proud dream,

01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:27.671
that playest so subtly
with a king's repose.

01:25:28.442 --> 01:25:31.669
I am a king that find thee,

01:25:32.188 --> 01:25:34.016
and I know...

01:25:36.745 --> 01:25:40.481
'tis not the balm,
the sceptre and the ball,

01:25:40.582 --> 01:25:44.114
the sword, the mace,
the crown imperial,

01:25:44.215 --> 01:25:48.124
the intertissued robe
of gold and pearl,

01:25:48.171 --> 01:25:51.359
the farced title running fore the king,

01:25:51.406 --> 01:25:54.780
the throne he sits on...

01:25:54.794 --> 01:25:56.944
nor the tide of pomp...

01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:00.392
that beats upon the high shore
of this world.

01:26:01.008 --> 01:26:05.789
No, not all these,
thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:09.908
not all these, laid in bed majestical,

01:26:09.939 --> 01:26:13.837
can sleep so soundly...

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.915
as the wretched slave,

01:26:16.939 --> 01:26:21.595
Who, with a body filled and
vacant mind, gets him to rest,

01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:23.587
crammed with distressful bread,

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:26.736
never sees horrid night,
the child of hell,

01:26:26.837 --> 01:26:28.973
but like a lackey,
from the rise to the set...

01:26:29.074 --> 01:26:31.374
sweats in the eye of Phoebus...

01:26:31.475 --> 01:26:34.894
and all night sleeps...

01:26:34.908 --> 01:26:36.534
in Elysium.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.227
Next day after dawn, doth rise
and help Hyperion to his horse...

01:26:42.258 --> 01:26:44.214
and follows so the ever-running year...

01:26:44.315 --> 01:26:48.024
with profitable labour to his grave.

01:26:48.084 --> 01:26:53.110
And but for ceremony...

01:26:53.855 --> 01:26:55.343
such a wretch,

01:26:55.956 --> 01:26:58.390
winding up days of toil...

01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:01.649
and nights with sleep...

01:27:03.225 --> 01:27:07.124
had the forehand and vantage...

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.310
of a king.

01:27:14.886 --> 01:27:18.898
My lord, your nobles,
jealous of your absence,

01:27:18.930 --> 01:27:22.021
seek through the camp to find you.

01:27:24.066 --> 01:27:25.361
Good old knight,

01:27:26.055 --> 01:27:28.954
Collect them all together at my tent.

01:27:29.847 --> 01:27:31.746
I'll be before thee.

01:27:35.877 --> 01:27:38.911
O God of battles,
steel my soldiers' hearts.

01:27:39.012 --> 01:27:41.348
Possess them not with fear.

01:27:41.434 --> 01:27:43.234
Take from them now
their sense of reckoning...

01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:46.807
if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them.

01:27:46.877 --> 01:27:50.541
Not today, o God, oh, not today.

01:27:50.611 --> 01:27:53.753
Think not upon the fault my
father made encompassing the crown.

01:27:53.854 --> 01:27:56.187
I Richard's body have interred new...

01:27:56.288 --> 01:27:58.889
and on it have bestowed
more contrite tears...

01:27:58.927 --> 01:28:01.525
than from it issued
forced drops of blood.

01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:05.019
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay...

01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:06.641
who twice a day their withered hands...

01:28:06.675 --> 01:28:09.110
hold up toward heaven to pardon blood.

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:12.288
And I have built two chantries...

01:28:12.289 --> 01:28:16.189
where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul.

01:28:17.047 --> 01:28:18.776
More will I do...

01:28:19.619 --> 01:28:22.651
though all that I can do...

01:28:22.723 --> 01:28:24.121
is nothing worth...

01:28:25.269 --> 01:28:28.902
since that my penitence comes, after all,

01:28:29.862 --> 01:28:32.658
imploring pardon.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:37.468
- My liege!
- My brother Gloucester's voice.

01:28:39.144 --> 01:28:41.043
I know thy errand.

01:28:42.148 --> 01:28:44.115
I will go with thee.

01:28:45.346 --> 01:28:49.103
The day, my friends,

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.822
and all things...

01:28:53.892 --> 01:28:55.222
stay...

01:28:56.935 --> 01:28:58.266
for me.

01:29:18.934 --> 01:29:23.473
Hark how our steeds
for present service neigh.

01:29:23.504 --> 01:29:26.470
Mount them and make incision
in their hides...

01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:30.239
that their hot blood
may spin in English eyes.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:34.074
Do but behold
yon poor and starved band.

01:29:34.175 --> 01:29:36.909
Your fair show shall
suck away their souls,

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:40.245
leaving them but
the shales and husks of men.

01:29:40.346 --> 01:29:43.248
There is not work enough
for all our hands.

01:29:43.349 --> 01:29:46.015
Why do you stay so long,
my lords of France?

01:29:46.116 --> 01:29:50.757
Yon island carrions, desperate of their
bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.

01:29:50.804 --> 01:29:54.794
They have said their prayers,
and they stay for death.

01:29:55.787 --> 01:30:00.313
A very little little let us do,
and all is done.

01:30:00.515 --> 01:30:04.890
Then let the trumpets sound the
tucket sonance and the note to mount...

01:30:04.969 --> 01:30:08.515
for our approach will
so much dare the field...

01:30:08.561 --> 01:30:13.324
that England shall crouch down
in fear... and yield!

01:30:28.239 --> 01:30:29.637
Where is the king?

01:30:29.973 --> 01:30:33.200
The king himself has rode
to view their battle.

01:30:41.379 --> 01:30:45.404
Of fighting men,
they have full threescore thousand.

01:30:45.682 --> 01:30:51.117
That's five to one.
Besides, they are all fresh.

01:30:51.219 --> 01:30:53.062
'Tis a fearful odds.

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:58.586
Oh, that we now had here but one ten
thousand of those men in England...

01:30:58.671 --> 01:31:00.773
that do no work today.

01:31:00.804 --> 01:31:05.669
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmorland?

01:31:08.929 --> 01:31:10.724
No, my fair cousin.

01:31:11.796 --> 01:31:17.332
If we are marked to die, we are
enough to do our country loss.

01:31:17.395 --> 01:31:20.461
And if to live, the fewer men,

01:31:20.507 --> 01:31:23.642
The greater share of honour.

01:31:23.719 --> 01:31:28.483
God's will, I pray thee,
wish not one man more.

01:31:29.805 --> 01:31:33.926
Rather, proclaim it,
Westmorland, through my host,

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:37.629
that he which hath
no stomach to this fight...

01:31:37.671 --> 01:31:39.069
let him depart.

01:31:39.609 --> 01:31:41.404
His passport shall be made...

01:31:41.443 --> 01:31:44.777
and crowns for convoy
put into his purse.

01:31:44.878 --> 01:31:47.246
We would not die
in that man's company...

01:31:47.347 --> 01:31:50.973
that fears his fellowship
to die with us.

01:31:52.317 --> 01:31:55.943
This day is called
the feast of Crispian.

01:31:56.252 --> 01:32:00.151
He that outlives this day
and comes safe home...

01:32:00.252 --> 01:32:03.820
will stand at tiptoe
when this day is named...

01:32:03.921 --> 01:32:06.790
and rouse him at the name of Crispian.

01:32:06.891 --> 01:32:10.174
He that shall see this day
and live old age...

01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:13.252
will yearly, on the vigil,
feast his neighbours...

01:32:13.307 --> 01:32:17.444
and say, "tomorrow is Saint Crispin's."

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:20.709
Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars...

01:32:20.734 --> 01:32:26.192
and say, "these wounds
I had on Crispin's day."

01:32:27.132 --> 01:32:29.748
Old men forget,

01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:33.475
yet all shall be forgot but
he'll remember with advantages...

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:36.084
what feats he did that day.

01:32:36.113 --> 01:32:40.115
Then shall our names, familiar
in their mouths as household words...

01:32:40.177 --> 01:32:42.511
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,

01:32:42.548 --> 01:32:44.956
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester...

01:32:44.996 --> 01:32:48.632
be in their flowing cups
freshly remembered.

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:52.584
This story shall
a good man teach his son.

01:32:52.648 --> 01:32:55.936
Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,

01:32:55.970 --> 01:33:00.076
from this day to
the ending of the world,

01:33:00.102 --> 01:33:03.624
but we in it shall be remembered.

01:33:04.948 --> 01:33:06.677
We few,

01:33:08.694 --> 01:33:11.116
we happy few,

01:33:11.156 --> 01:33:13.538
we band of brothers.

01:33:13.574 --> 01:33:17.401
For he today that sheds his
blood with me shall be my brother.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:21.784
Be he ne'er so vile,
this day shall gentle his condition.

01:33:21.802 --> 01:33:24.628
And gentlemen in England now abed...

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:28.276
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...

01:33:28.304 --> 01:33:31.172
and hold their manhoods cheap...

01:33:31.203 --> 01:33:34.889
whiles any speaks
that fought with us...

01:33:34.969 --> 01:33:38.403
upon Saint Cispin's day!

01:33:43.104 --> 01:33:46.606
My sovereign lord!
Bestow yourself with speed!

01:33:46.684 --> 01:33:48.745
The French are bravely
in their battle set...

01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:51.635
and will with all expedience
march upon us!

01:33:51.662 --> 01:33:55.096
All things are ready
if our minds be so!

01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:57.518
Perish the man whose mind
is backward now.

01:33:57.549 --> 01:34:00.104
Thou dost not wish more help
from England, coz?

01:34:00.163 --> 01:34:02.097
God's will, my liege.

01:34:02.128 --> 01:34:06.784
You and I alone, without more help,
could fight this royal battle.

01:34:06.828 --> 01:34:08.612
You know your places!

01:34:08.705 --> 01:34:11.211
God be with you all!

01:34:19.657 --> 01:34:22.005
Once more I come to know
of thee, if for they ransom,

01:34:22.067 --> 01:34:26.159
thou wilt now compound before
thy most assured overthrow.

01:34:27.185 --> 01:34:30.231
- Who hast sent thee now?
- The constable of France.

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:34.060
I pray thee bear my former answer back.

01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:38.583
Bid them achieve me
and then sell my bones!

01:34:38.634 --> 01:34:42.923
Good God, why should they
mock poor fellows thus?

01:34:42.985 --> 01:34:45.271
Let me speak proudly.

01:34:45.372 --> 01:34:48.344
Tell the constable we are but
warriors for the working day.

01:34:48.376 --> 01:34:51.207
Our gayness and our gilt
are all besmirched...

01:34:51.261 --> 01:34:53.927
with rainy marching
in the painful field,

01:34:53.997 --> 01:34:58.046
but by the mass,
our hearts are in the trim.

01:34:58.078 --> 01:35:01.143
Herald, save thou thy labour.

01:35:01.953 --> 01:35:06.056
Come thou no more for ransom,
gentle herald.

01:35:06.115 --> 01:35:09.912
They shall have none, I swear,

01:35:09.997 --> 01:35:13.435
but these my joints!

01:35:13.483 --> 01:35:17.982
Which, if they have
as I shall leave of them,

01:35:18.038 --> 01:35:21.970
shall yield them little.

01:35:24.557 --> 01:35:25.750
Tell the constable.

01:35:26.564 --> 01:35:28.478
I shall, king Harry.

01:35:30.353 --> 01:35:31.926
And so fare thee well.

01:35:32.027 --> 01:35:35.221
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.

01:35:42.697 --> 01:35:45.199
My lord, most humbly on my knee,

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.358
I beg the leading of the vaward.

01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:52.618
Take it, brave York.

01:35:54.906 --> 01:35:59.066
Now, soldiers, march away,

01:35:59.508 --> 01:36:02.497
and how thou pleasest, God,

01:36:04.031 --> 01:36:05.895
dispose the day.

01:36:23.885 --> 01:36:25.987
And so our scene must
to the battle fly...

01:36:26.088 --> 01:36:28.254
where, oh, for pity
we shall much disgrace...

01:36:28.355 --> 01:36:30.889
with four or five
most vile and ragged foils...

01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:33.817
right ill-disposed
in brawl ridiculous...

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.861
the name of Agincourt.

01:37:39.426 --> 01:37:40.722
Ready!

01:38:01.643 --> 01:38:02.869
Ready!

01:38:06.473 --> 01:38:08.507
Fire!

01:41:49.855 --> 01:41:53.221
Why, all our ranks are broke.

01:41:53.326 --> 01:41:54.851
O perdurable shame!

01:41:55.297 --> 01:41:58.769
Shame and eternal shame.

01:41:59.807 --> 01:42:01.487
Nothing but shame.

01:42:08.084 --> 01:42:12.318
Let us die in arms.
Once more back again.

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:15.530
We are enough yet living in the field
to smother up the English in our throngs...

01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:17.265
if any order might be thought upon.

01:42:17.366 --> 01:42:20.535
The devil take order now!

01:42:20.605 --> 01:42:22.230
I'll to the throng!

01:42:22.254 --> 01:42:27.879
Let life be short!
Else shame will be too long!

01:42:39.936 --> 01:42:43.040
Well have we done,
thrice-valiant countrymen!

01:42:43.141 --> 01:42:44.666
Yet all's not done!

01:42:45.044 --> 01:42:47.749
Yet keep the French the field!

01:46:01.663 --> 01:46:04.996
Kill the boys and the luggage.

01:46:06.205 --> 01:46:10.439
'Tis expressly against the law of arms.

01:46:13.017 --> 01:46:17.389
'Tis as errant a piece
of knavery, mark you now,

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.880
as can be offered.

01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:26.233
In your conscience, now, is it not?

01:46:28.341 --> 01:46:31.537
'Tis certain there's
not a boy left alive.

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.238
I was not angry since I came to France!

01:46:47.339 --> 01:46:48.864
Until this instant!

01:46:49.075 --> 01:46:52.341
Here comes the herald
of the French, my liege.

01:46:58.357 --> 01:47:02.330
What means this, herald?
Huh? Com'st thou again for ransom?

01:47:02.331 --> 01:47:04.446
No! Great king!

01:47:05.011 --> 01:47:07.235
I come to thee
for charitable license...

01:47:07.252 --> 01:47:09.891
that we may wander o'er this
bloody field to book our dead...

01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:11.727
and then to bury them.

01:47:12.227 --> 01:47:15.282
To sort our nobles from our common men.

01:47:15.518 --> 01:47:17.455
For many of our princes...
woe the while...

01:47:17.556 --> 01:47:20.889
lie drowned and soaked
in mercenary blood.

01:47:21.997 --> 01:47:25.333
O, give us leave, great king,
to view the field in safety...

01:47:25.434 --> 01:47:28.403
and to dispose of their dead bodies.

01:47:28.673 --> 01:47:30.583
I tell thee truly, herald,

01:47:31.348 --> 01:47:35.427
I know not if the day be ours or no.

01:47:37.655 --> 01:47:40.490
The day is yours.

01:47:51.444 --> 01:47:53.858
Praised be god...

01:47:54.902 --> 01:47:58.235
and not our strength for it.

01:48:24.363 --> 01:48:27.488
What is this castle called...

01:48:27.519 --> 01:48:29.160
that stands hard by?

01:48:30.374 --> 01:48:32.636
They call it Agincourt.

01:48:34.147 --> 01:48:35.409
Then call we this...

01:48:37.185 --> 01:48:40.279
the field of Agincourt...

01:48:41.258 --> 01:48:46.594
fought on the day
of Crispin Crispianus.

01:49:02.293 --> 01:49:05.029
Your grandfather of famous memory,

01:49:05.067 --> 01:49:07.226
an't please your majesty,

01:49:08.831 --> 01:49:13.701
and your great-uncle, Edward,
the black prince of Wales,

01:49:14.249 --> 01:49:16.740
as I have read in the Chronicles,

01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:21.490
fought a most brave battle
here in France.

01:49:21.591 --> 01:49:22.657
They did, Fluellen.

01:49:22.727 --> 01:49:25.592
Y-your majesty says very true.

01:49:29.598 --> 01:49:33.534
If your majesty is remembered of it,

01:49:33.835 --> 01:49:39.434
the Welshmen did good service in
a garden where leeks did grow,

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:43.421
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps,
which, as your majesty know,

01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:46.827
to this hour is
an honourable badge of service.

01:49:48.769 --> 01:49:51.121
And I do believe your majesty
takes no scorn...

01:49:51.172 --> 01:49:54.443
to wear the leek upon St. Davy's day.

01:49:54.504 --> 01:49:57.870
I wear it for a memorable honour,

01:49:58.470 --> 01:50:03.066
for I am Welsh, you know,
good my countryman.

01:50:13.323 --> 01:50:15.401
All the water in Wye...

01:50:15.453 --> 01:50:20.289
cannot wash your majesty's Welsh blood
out of your body, I can tell you that.

01:50:20.428 --> 01:50:24.417
God bless it and preserve it, so long
as it pleases his grace...

01:50:24.495 --> 01:50:25.892
and his majesty too.

01:50:26.263 --> 01:50:30.802
- Thanks, good my countryman.
- By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman!

01:50:30.903 --> 01:50:35.807
I care not who know it.
I shall confess it to all the world!

01:50:37.902 --> 01:50:41.269
And I need not be ashamed
of your majesty, praised be god,

01:50:43.027 --> 01:50:47.987
so long as your majesty
is an honest man.

01:50:49.467 --> 01:50:51.098
God keep me so.

01:50:59.704 --> 01:51:04.272
Doth fortune play
the housewife with me now?

01:51:06.525 --> 01:51:09.691
News I have that my Nell is dead.

01:51:13.422 --> 01:51:15.438
Old do I wax,

01:51:16.023 --> 01:51:21.197
and from my weary limbs
honour is cudgelled.

01:51:22.447 --> 01:51:23.608
Well,

01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:26.160
bawd I'll turn...

01:51:27.799 --> 01:51:33.403
and something lean
to cutpurse of quick hand.

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.262
To England will I steal,

01:51:39.516 --> 01:51:44.374
and there I'll... steal.

01:51:49.989 --> 01:51:52.619
Herald, are the dead numbered?

01:51:53.567 --> 01:51:56.255
Here is the number
of the slaughtered French.

01:52:08.039 --> 01:52:12.013
This note doth tell me of...

01:52:14.142 --> 01:52:17.827
10,000 French...

01:52:17.869 --> 01:52:20.635
that in the field lie slain.

01:52:21.013 --> 01:52:24.659
Of princes in this number, 126.

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:30.938
Added to these, of knights,
esquires and gallant gentlemen,

01:52:31.716 --> 01:52:36.021
eight thousand and four hundred...

01:52:36.901 --> 01:52:39.241
of the which five hundred...

01:52:39.342 --> 01:52:42.678
were but yesterday dubbed knights.

01:52:44.915 --> 01:52:48.082
Here was a royal fellowship of death.

01:52:50.632 --> 01:52:53.205
Where is the number
of our English dead?

01:52:59.818 --> 01:53:02.372
"Edward, the duke of York,

01:53:03.885 --> 01:53:06.355
"the earl of Suffolk,

01:53:08.358 --> 01:53:10.387
"Sir Richard Ketly,

01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.688
"Davy Gam, esquire."

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.559
None else of name...

01:53:21.774 --> 01:53:24.764
and of all other men...

01:53:25.688 --> 01:53:29.954
but five-and-twenty.

01:53:35.538 --> 01:53:36.699
'Tis wonderful.

01:53:39.926 --> 01:53:41.223
Come.

01:53:42.618 --> 01:53:44.777
Go we in procession to the village...

01:53:45.847 --> 01:53:48.511
and be it death proclaimed
through our host...

01:53:48.546 --> 01:53:50.440
to boast of this...

01:53:50.463 --> 01:53:54.657
or take that praise
from God which is his only.

01:53:54.681 --> 01:53:59.208
Is it not lawful, an't please your
majesty, to tell how many is killed?

01:53:59.738 --> 01:54:01.103
Aye, captain,

01:54:01.618 --> 01:54:04.391
but with this acknowledgement:

01:54:04.405 --> 01:54:07.227
That God fought...

01:54:11.228 --> 01:54:12.592
for us.

01:54:15.268 --> 01:54:16.531
Yes, my conscience.

01:54:19.344 --> 01:54:21.370
He did us great good.

01:54:23.905 --> 01:54:27.135
Do we all holy rites.

01:54:27.522 --> 01:54:31.269
Let there be sung Non Nobisante Deum.

01:54:31.308 --> 01:54:34.742
The dead with charity enclosed in clay.

01:54:35.488 --> 01:54:37.808
And then to Calais...

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.410
and to England then,

01:54:41.438 --> 01:54:45.457
where ne'er from France arrived...

01:54:45.473 --> 01:54:47.601
more happy men.

Peace to this meeting.

01:59:31.474 --> 01:59:35.604
Unto our brother France,
health and fair time of day.

01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:40.016
Joy and good wishes to our most fair
and princely cousin Katherine.

01:59:40.055 --> 01:59:41.820
And as a branch and member
of this royalty...

01:59:41.891 --> 01:59:44.640
by whom this great assembly
is contrived,

01:59:44.706 --> 01:59:46.939
we do salute you, duke of Burgundy.

01:59:46.986 --> 01:59:50.656
And, princes French and peers,

01:59:50.688 --> 01:59:52.713
health to you all.

01:59:54.510 --> 02:00:00.384
Right joyous are we to behold your
face, most worthy brother England.

02:00:00.461 --> 02:00:01.722
Fairly met.

02:00:03.557 --> 02:00:07.617
So are you, princes English, every one.

02:00:16.615 --> 02:00:21.170
My duty to you both, on equal love,

02:00:21.206 --> 02:00:24.006
great kings of France...

02:00:24.066 --> 02:00:25.294
and England.

02:00:30.685 --> 02:00:33.999
Since that my office
hath so far prevailed,

02:00:34.054 --> 02:00:38.451
that face to face and royal
eye to eye you have congreeted...

02:00:38.474 --> 02:00:42.811
let it not disgrace me if I
demand before this royal view...

02:00:42.842 --> 02:00:46.083
why that the naked,
poor and mangled peace...

02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:49.548
should not in this best
garden of the world,

02:00:49.603 --> 02:00:53.548
our fertile France,
put up her lovely visage?

02:00:54.497 --> 02:00:55.521
Alas,

02:00:56.566 --> 02:01:00.168
<i>she hath from France
too long been chased,</i>

02:01:00.224 --> 02:01:03.852
<i>and all her husbandry
doth lie on heaps,</i>

02:01:03.862 --> 02:01:07.624
corrupting in its own fertility.

02:01:09.254 --> 02:01:12.387
<i>And as our vineyards,
fallows, meads and hedges,</i>

02:01:12.409 --> 02:01:15.559
<i>defective in their natures,
grow to wildness,</i>

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:20.771
<i>even so our houses and ourselves,
our children have lost...</i>

02:01:20.809 --> 02:01:23.296
<i>or do not learn for want of time...</i>

02:01:23.339 --> 02:01:26.780
<i>those sciences which
should become our country,</i>

02:01:26.834 --> 02:01:31.420
but grow like savages,
as soldiers will...

02:01:31.445 --> 02:01:34.733
that nothing do
but meditate on blood...

02:01:34.786 --> 02:01:39.754
to swearing and stern looks,
diffused attire,

02:01:39.803 --> 02:01:42.692
and everything that seems...

02:01:43.895 --> 02:01:45.535
unnatural.

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:50.052
And my speech entreats
that I may know...

02:01:50.107 --> 02:01:52.340
the let why gentle peace...

02:01:52.387 --> 02:01:56.381
should not expel
these inconveniences...

02:01:56.412 --> 02:02:00.498
and bless us with her former qualities.

02:02:02.844 --> 02:02:06.696
If, duke of Burgundy,
you would the peace...

02:02:06.732 --> 02:02:10.899
whose want gives growth to the
imperfections which you have cited,

02:02:10.981 --> 02:02:13.201
then you must buy that peace...

02:02:13.267 --> 02:02:18.150
with full accord
to all our just demands.

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:22.545
I have but with a cursorary eye...

02:02:22.593 --> 02:02:25.241
o'erglanced the articles.

02:02:25.262 --> 02:02:28.366
Pleaseth your grace to appoint
some of your council...

02:02:28.391 --> 02:02:31.194
to sit with us once more...

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:33.961
we will suddenly pass...

02:02:33.991 --> 02:02:37.424
our accept and peremptory answer.

02:02:38.222 --> 02:02:39.484
Brother, we shall.

02:02:41.894 --> 02:02:45.159
Yet leave our cousin Katherine...

02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:46.521
here with us.

02:02:49.263 --> 02:02:52.834
She is our capital demand...

02:02:52.875 --> 02:02:56.570
comprised within
the fore-rank of our articles.

02:03:02.113 --> 02:03:03.603
She hath good leave.

02:03:21.999 --> 02:03:24.801
Fair Katherine, and most fair,

02:03:24.824 --> 02:03:26.958
will you vouchsafe
to teach a soldier...

02:03:26.988 --> 02:03:29.441
terms such as will enter
at a lady's ear...

02:03:29.490 --> 02:03:33.481
and plead his love suit
to her gentle heart?

02:03:33.966 --> 02:03:37.135
Your majesty shall mock at me.

02:03:38.166 --> 02:03:40.697
I cannot speak your England.

02:03:41.582 --> 02:03:42.947
Oh.

02:03:45.077 --> 02:03:48.725
Fair Katherine, if you will love me
soundly with your French heart,

02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:52.417
I will be glad to hear you confess it
brokenly with your English

02:03:53.308 --> 02:03:55.225
Do you like me, Kate?

02:03:55.873 --> 02:03:59.950
Pardon me. I cannot
tell what is "like me".

02:03:59.989 --> 02:04:02.955
An angel is like you, Kate,
and you are like an angel.

02:04:03.053 --> 02:04:05.087
What does he say? That I resemble an angel?

02:04:05.188 --> 02:04:08.524
Indeed, but your grace,
that's what he said.

02:04:09.586 --> 02:04:11.178
My God.

02:04:11.194 --> 02:04:14.709
The tongues of men are full of deceits.

02:04:14.749 --> 02:04:16.149
What says she, fair one?

02:04:16.187 --> 02:04:21.467
That the tongues of men
are full of deceits?

02:04:21.498 --> 02:04:25.904
Oui. That the tongues of
the mens is be full of deceits.

02:04:25.953 --> 02:04:28.477
That is the princess.

02:04:30.039 --> 02:04:33.070
I'faith, my wooing is fit
for thy understanding.

02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:37.519
I know no ways to mince it in love,
but directly to say, "I love you."

02:04:37.539 --> 02:04:41.567
Then, if you urge me farther than to say,
"Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit.

02:04:41.591 --> 02:04:46.388
Give me your answer... I'faith do... and so
clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?

02:04:46.427 --> 02:04:49.360
Your honour, me understand well.

02:04:49.562 --> 02:04:53.633
Marry, if you would put me to verses or
to dance for your sake, why, you undid me.

02:04:53.734 --> 02:04:56.679
If I could win a lady at leapfrog
or by vaulting into my saddle...

02:04:56.726 --> 02:04:58.976
with my arm around my back,
I should quickly leap into a wife.

02:04:59.038 --> 02:05:02.593
I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jackanapes, never off.

02:05:02.614 --> 02:05:06.628
But before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly...

02:05:06.683 --> 02:05:11.378
Nor gasp out my eloquence nor
I have no cunning in protestation.

02:05:12.414 --> 02:05:14.334
If thou canst love a fellow
of this temper, Kate,

02:05:14.358 --> 02:05:17.264
that never looks in his glass
for love of anything he sees there,

02:05:17.288 --> 02:05:19.764
let thine eye be thy cook.

02:05:19.793 --> 02:05:24.131
I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou
canst love me for this, take me.

02:05:24.161 --> 02:05:26.497
If not, to say to thee
that I shall die, 'tis true,

02:05:26.529 --> 02:05:29.489
but for thy love, by the lord, no.

02:05:29.541 --> 02:05:31.304
Yet I love thee too.

02:05:32.609 --> 02:05:35.669
If thou would have such a one, take me.

02:05:35.724 --> 02:05:39.099
And take me, take a soldier.

02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:42.913
Take a soldier, take a king.

02:05:43.909 --> 02:05:46.239
And what sayest thou then to my love?

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:49.217
Speak, my fair,

02:05:49.264 --> 02:05:51.784
and fairly, too, I pray thee.

02:05:52.018 --> 02:05:56.452
Is it possible that I should
love the enemy of France?

02:05:57.022 --> 02:05:58.489
No, Kate.

02:05:59.291 --> 02:06:03.423
It is not possible that you should
love the enemy of France, Kate.

02:06:04.238 --> 02:06:07.672
But in loving me, you should
love the friend of France,

02:06:07.703 --> 02:06:11.171
for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it.

02:06:11.194 --> 02:06:13.086
I will have it all mine.

02:06:13.116 --> 02:06:15.695
And, Kate, when France
is mine, and I am yours,

02:06:15.739 --> 02:06:18.968
then yours is France, and you are mine.

02:06:20.976 --> 02:06:23.296
I cannot tell what is that.

02:06:23.327 --> 02:06:24.452
No, Kate?

02:06:26.382 --> 02:06:30.385
I will tell thee in French...

02:06:30.486 --> 02:06:32.698
which I am sure will
hang about my tongue...

02:06:32.745 --> 02:06:37.112
like a new-married wife about her
husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.

02:06:39.023 --> 02:06:42.640
When I am in possession of France...

02:06:42.738 --> 02:06:49.995
and when you are in possession of me...

02:06:50.927 --> 02:06:52.261
Let me see...

02:06:55.086 --> 02:06:58.929
So, uh, yours is France...

02:06:58.957 --> 02:07:03.393
and you are mine.

02:07:04.037 --> 02:07:06.068
It is as easy for me, Kate,
to conquer the kingdom...

02:07:06.103 --> 02:07:07.818
as to speak so much more French!

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:11.185
I will never move thee in French
unless it be to laugh at me.

02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:17.365
But your honour, the
French that you speak...

02:07:17.388 --> 02:07:21.233
is worse than the English that I speak.

02:07:22.018 --> 02:07:24.351
No, faith, it is not.

02:07:24.694 --> 02:07:25.854
But tell me, Kate,

02:07:26.635 --> 02:07:30.399
Canst thou understand
thus much English?

02:07:31.523 --> 02:07:35.851
Canst thou love me?

02:07:38.466 --> 02:07:39.625
I cannot tell.

02:07:39.676 --> 02:07:42.576
Well, can any of your neighbours
tell, Kate? I'll ask them.

02:07:43.325 --> 02:07:45.965
By mine honour, in true English,
I swear I love thee,

02:07:46.023 --> 02:07:48.848
by which honour I dare
not swear thou lovest me.

02:07:48.897 --> 02:07:53.278
Yet my blood begins to flatter
me that thou dost...

02:07:53.338 --> 02:07:56.986
notwithstanding the poor and
untempering effect of my visage.

02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:59.228
Now beshrew my father's ambition!

02:07:59.267 --> 02:08:01.346
He was thinking of
civil wars when he got me.

02:08:01.383 --> 02:08:04.213
Therefore was I created
with a stubborn outside,

02:08:04.242 --> 02:08:08.187
with an aspect of iron, that
when I come to woo ladies,

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.605
I fright them.

02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:14.069
But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax,
the better I shall appear.

02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:18.838
My comfort is that old age,
that ill layer-up of beauty,

02:08:18.903 --> 02:08:22.143
can do no more spoil upon my face.

02:08:22.198 --> 02:08:26.565
Thou hast me... if thou
hast me... at the worst.

02:08:26.586 --> 02:08:30.567
And thou shalt wear me...
if thou wear me...

02:08:30.615 --> 02:08:31.974
better and better.

02:08:32.025 --> 02:08:36.642
And, therefore, tell me,
most fair Katherine,

02:08:36.692 --> 02:08:38.523
will you have me?

02:08:39.194 --> 02:08:41.243
Come, your answer in broken music,

02:08:41.292 --> 02:08:44.308
for thy voice is music,

02:08:44.344 --> 02:08:47.675
and thy English, broken.

02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:51.838
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,

02:08:51.855 --> 02:08:53.823
wilt thou have me?

02:08:55.616 --> 02:08:57.834
That is as it shall please
the king, my father.

02:08:57.890 --> 02:09:00.218
Nay.

02:09:00.318 --> 02:09:03.417
It shall please him well, Kate.

02:09:03.744 --> 02:09:06.644
It shall please him, Kate.

02:09:07.735 --> 02:09:11.101
Then it shall also content me.

02:09:14.373 --> 02:09:19.943
Upon that, I kiss your hand,
and I call you my queen.

02:09:19.971 --> 02:09:22.408
Leave, my lord. Leave, leave!

02:09:22.427 --> 02:09:25.228
My faith, I don't want to
lower your greatness...

02:09:25.259 --> 02:09:29.125
by kissing the hand of one of the
unworthy servants of your lordship.

02:09:29.148 --> 02:09:33.518
Excuse me, I beg you,
my most powerful lord.

02:09:33.907 --> 02:09:35.977
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:41.282
It's not custom in France for ladies and
girls to be kissed before their weddings.

02:09:41.363 --> 02:09:43.223
Madame my interpreter, what says she?

02:09:43.259 --> 02:09:46.129
That is not be the fashion
for the ladies of France...

02:09:46.155 --> 02:09:49.957
Oh, I cannot tell
what is "baiser" in English.

02:09:50.004 --> 02:09:51.471
To kiss?

02:09:51.873 --> 02:09:54.517
Your majesty entends better que moi.

02:09:54.571 --> 02:10:00.016
Ah, it is not a fashion for the maids in France
to kiss before they are married, would you say?

02:10:00.037 --> 02:10:02.193
Yes, correct.

02:10:02.228 --> 02:10:03.421
Oh, Kate.

02:10:04.551 --> 02:10:07.004
Nice customs curtsy to great kings.

02:10:07.043 --> 02:10:11.753
You and I cannot be confined within
the weak list of a country's fashion.

02:10:11.785 --> 02:10:16.515
We... are the makers of manners, Kate.

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.392
Therefore, patiently...

02:10:19.425 --> 02:10:20.790
and yielding.

02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:35.396
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate.

02:10:36.285 --> 02:10:40.441
There is more eloquence
in a sugar touch of them...

02:10:40.505 --> 02:10:43.371
than in the tongues
of the French council.

02:10:43.436 --> 02:10:45.732
Here comes your father.

02:10:49.789 --> 02:10:52.517
God save your majesty.

02:10:52.858 --> 02:10:54.644
My royal cousin,

02:10:54.683 --> 02:10:57.809
teach you our princess English?

02:10:59.396 --> 02:11:05.661
I would have her learn, my fair cousin,
how perfectly I love her,

02:11:06.512 --> 02:11:09.246
and that is good English.

02:11:28.459 --> 02:11:33.055
We have consented
to all terms of reason.

02:11:49.976 --> 02:11:54.069
And thereupon give me your daughter.

02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:58.485
Take her, fair son,

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.184
and from her blood
raise up issue to me...

02:12:06.224 --> 02:12:10.037
that the contending kingdoms
of France and England...

02:12:10.104 --> 02:12:15.064
whose very shores look pale with
envy of each other's happiness...

02:12:15.088 --> 02:12:18.386
may cease their hatred...

02:12:18.405 --> 02:12:21.049
and this dear conjunction...

02:12:21.098 --> 02:12:23.900
plant neighbourhood...

02:12:23.971 --> 02:12:27.603
and Christian-like accord
in their sweet bosoms...

02:12:27.628 --> 02:12:30.689
that never war advance...

02:12:30.713 --> 02:12:33.283
his bleeding sword...

02:12:33.315 --> 02:12:37.715
'twixt England and fair France.

02:12:38.309 --> 02:12:39.325
Amen.

02:12:41.252 --> 02:12:45.686
Now, welcome, Kate,
and bear me witness all...

02:12:46.107 --> 02:12:50.406
That here I kiss her
as my sovereign queen.

02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:00.742
God, the best maker of all marriages,

02:13:00.819 --> 02:13:04.221
combine our hearts in one,
our realms in one.

02:13:04.862 --> 02:13:08.449
As man and wife, being two,
are one in love,

02:13:08.481 --> 02:13:12.465
so be there 'twixt our kingdoms
such a spousal...

02:13:12.531 --> 02:13:16.207
that never may ill office
or fell jealousy...

02:13:16.262 --> 02:13:19.418
which troubles oft
the bed of blessed marriage...

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:22.714
thrust in between
the paction of these kingdoms...

02:13:22.753 --> 02:13:25.871
to make divorce
of their incorporate league...

02:13:25.906 --> 02:13:27.942
that English may as French,

02:13:27.981 --> 02:13:31.617
French Englishmen, receive each other.

02:13:31.686 --> 02:13:33.881
God speak this.

02:13:34.441 --> 02:13:37.122
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:13:39.972 --> 02:13:44.690
Thus far, with rough
and all-unable pen...

02:13:44.749 --> 02:13:48.502
our bending author
hath pursued the story...

02:13:48.551 --> 02:13:52.222
in little room confining mighty men...

02:13:52.246 --> 02:13:56.902
mangling by starts
the full course of their glory.

02:13:56.939 --> 02:13:58.808
Small time,

02:13:58.857 --> 02:14:02.645
but in that small most greatly lived...

02:14:02.672 --> 02:14:05.696
this star of England.

02:14:06.525 --> 02:14:08.723
Fortune made his sword...

02:14:08.743 --> 02:14:12.423
by which the world's
best garden he achieved...

02:14:12.463 --> 02:14:16.203
and of it left his son imperial lord.

02:14:16.244 --> 02:14:21.033
Henry the sixth, in infant bands
crowned king of France and England

02:14:21.055 --> 02:14:24.345
did this king succeed...

02:14:24.408 --> 02:14:28.791
whose state so many had the managing...

02:14:28.821 --> 02:14:31.939
that they lost France...

02:14:31.974 --> 02:14:36.652
and made his England bleed...

02:14:36.676 --> 02:14:40.183
which oft our stage hath shown,

02:14:40.212 --> 02:14:42.878
and, for their sake,

02:14:42.915 --> 02:14:48.890
in your fair minds
let this acceptance take.
