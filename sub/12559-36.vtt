12:19.948 --> 12:22.064
TO GET AWAY
FROM UNWORTHY PARENTS,

12:22.158 --> 12:24.320
BUT I ALWAYS RESISTED
THE TEMPTATION.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.321
<i>(Gloria)

12:29.999 --> 12:32.582
<i>YOU DARN KIDS,
WHERE ARE YOU?</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:34.626
WE BETTER GO HOME.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.455
THOSE VOICES YOU HEAR CALLING
AT FIRST SEEM QUITE STRONG,

12:38.549 --> 12:40.927
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
THEY'LL FADE

12:40.969 --> 12:44.337
AND ONE DAY, YOU SIMPLY
CAN'T HEAR 'EM ANYMORE.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.511
<i>(Gloria)

12:45.598 --> 12:47.339
WE'VE GOT TO GO HOME.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.094
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.767
BECAUSE WE'RE
THEIR CHILDREN,

12:50.812 --> 12:53.429
WE LOVE THEM
AND THEY LOVE US.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.688
THEN YOU MUST
GO BACK.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.311
AND YOU, TOO.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.643
YOUR SISTER'S REASONS
ARE QUITE \/ALID.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.603
HOW DO WE

13:01.698 --> 13:03.280
SAME WAY

13:03.324 --> 13:05.315
WE'LL COME SEE
YOU AGAIN SOON.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.617
OH, NO, MY DARLINGS.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.446
I EXPECT THIS
IS OUR GOOD-BYE.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.623
FINDING YOUR VVAY HERE AGAIN
VVOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.041
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.960
(both)
GOOD-BYE, AUNT T.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.663
(boy) I'LL RACE YOU BACK

13:49.954 --> 13:50.989
HAVE YOU FOUND THEM?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.582
NOT A SIGN.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.372
I TOLD THEM NOT TO
LEAVE THIS YARD.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.166
<i>THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU.</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:57.826
YOU'RE NOT
FIRM ENOUGH.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.251
YOU DON'T SPEND
ENOUGH TIME WITH THEM.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.125
YOU TRY PUTTING UP

14:01.215 --> 14:02.376
VVITH THEIR VVHINING
24 HOURS A DAY.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.334

14:10.433 --> 14:14.051
[angry] WE'VE BEEN
CALLING YOU FOR AN HOUR.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.103
<i>GET OUT

14:17.190 --> 14:18.772
SPORT, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.849
IN THE POOL.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.196
YOU'RE LYING, I
LOOKED IN THE POOL.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.940
WE REALLY
WERE, DADDY.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.772
WE CAME UP
ON THE OTHER SIDE

14:26.866 --> 14:29.699
AND MADE A CHOCOLATE
CAKE WITH AUNT T.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.027
CAKE WITH... WHAT'S
HE TALKING ABOUT?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.532
WE CAUGHT A FISH.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.785
HE'S JUST MAKING
THINGS UP, DADDY.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.036
HE'S LYING
TO COVER UP

14:37.126 --> 14:38.582
WHATEVER
YOU BEEN IN.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.956
I WANT THE TRUTH,
BOY, NO MORE LIES.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.879
LWASN'T LYING,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.581
LISTEN TO ME.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.803
GET TO YOUR ROOM AND
STAND IN THE CORNER

14:46.886 --> 14:49.048
UNTIL YOU'RE READY
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.963
IT WAS JUST
A GAME, DADDY.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.139
WE WERE JUST PRETENDING.
THERE ISN'T ANY AUNT T.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.392
YOU GO ALONG

15:12.745 --> 15:15.737
WELL, WHERE'S
YOUR BROTHER JEB?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.414
IN HIS ROOM.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.831
HE'S NOT IN
THE HOUSE ANYPLACE.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.909
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.578
IS BREAKFAST READY?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.913
NO. NOW, YOUR
FATHER'S WAITING.

WANT TO HAVE A TALK
WITH YOU KIDS.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.917
WHAT ABOUT?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.672
THERE'S GONNA BE
SOME CHANGES AROUND HERE.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.424
THINGS GOING TO
BE BETTER, MAMA?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.098

16:09.010 --> 16:11.968
WHY DO THERE

16:12.054 --> 16:14.967
OH, EVERY CHILD
MUST HAVE CHORES TO DO.

16:15.016 --> 16:19.385
IT TEAOHES HIM DIGNITY OF
VVORK AND THE JOY OF LABOR.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.561
