01:29.856 --> 01:31.051
Oh, boy.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.523
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Rich. Busy, busy, busy.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.253
- Good.
- Money, money, money.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.796
- Oh, right. -Oh, what a...
Okay, what are you gonna have?

01:37.931 --> 01:41.458
I'll have, uh, uh...

01:41.602 --> 01:44.663
-uh, ham and egg on toast. Yeah.
- Oh, good.

01:44.805 --> 01:48.298
Clarence,
Adam and Eve on a raft!

01:55.749 --> 01:58.878
Well, Rich,
notice anything different, huh?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.479
You're in pain.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.648
Any fool can see that.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.986
What else?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.457
I'll give you a hint.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.722
Muscles.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.059
Yeah, we tried out
for the weightlifting team.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.964
No one's gonna throw sand
in our face anymore.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.797
That's right.
(grunts)

02:16.937 --> 02:20.271
Dumbbells, barbells,
curls, presses.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.932
Just look at this bicep, Rich.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.804
(groaning)

02:23.944 --> 02:26.470
You'll have to take my word
for it. It's like iron.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.741
- Let's sit down, Malph.
- Right.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.408
Rich, could you duck down
a minute?

02:31.551 --> 02:33.542
Thanks.
(groaning)

02:36.623 --> 02:38.352
That's right.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.587
(Al speaking indistinctly)

02:43.664 --> 02:44.825
(crowd murmuring)

02:44.965 --> 02:47.991
Fonz, I'm sorry.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.398
Fonz, are-are you all right?

02:49.536 --> 02:51.664
Hey, I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.671
Everything's cool. I'm okay.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.208
Come on, come on! Clear the way!
Give him some air, will you?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.707
Fonz, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.042
Hey, Al, just calm yourself,
will you?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.513
Right, right. I'll be calm.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.846
All right,
just resume your festivities.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.613
I'm cool.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.223
All right, look, Cunningham...

03:11.358 --> 03:12.689
I'm-I'm here, Fonz.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.555
See, I knew that. I knew that.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.163
- All right. -Look,
I-l think you should sit down

03:16.296 --> 03:17.957
-and just... and just rest
for a second, okay? -Yeah. Okay.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.090
- Yeah, just for a minute.
- I am.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.365
Look out, Fonz!

03:23.503 --> 03:26.234
- Fonz, you almost sat
on the floor. -Yeah.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.705
Everything is just a little
blurry right now, you know?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.776
Uh, maybe-maybe just
as a precaution

03:30.911 --> 03:32.106
you should see a doctor, Fonz.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.974
A doctor? I really hurt him.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.242
Look, I ain't going
to see no doctor.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.511
If I need a doctor,
I go to a doctor.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.780
What I need is some tender
loving care, you know?

03:40.921 --> 03:44.186
And, uh, Helen here is just
the one to give it to me.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.849
Fonz...

03:45.992 --> 03:49.451
Rich, get me to a doctor
right now.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.998
<i>HOWARD: Marion, would you please
sit down and relax?</i>

03:54.134 --> 03:55.499
I'm so worried about Arthur.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.104
I mean, the boys should've been
back from the doctor by now.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.603
Well, he's gonna be just fine.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.004
Richie said he just got a bump
on the head.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.100
- Oh, Fonzie, you okay?
- Oh, oh.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.237
- How is your bump?
- Well, what did the doctor say?

04:08.381 --> 04:11.112
Hey, the doctor said
it was nothing, you know?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.744
My orbs are having a little
trouble making out shapes.

04:14.888 --> 04:20.553
Uh... there's nothing wrong
with your shape, Mrs. C.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.560
Fonzie, that's my Dad.
(chuckles)

04:22.696 --> 04:25.165
Hey, I knew that. I knew that.

04:25.298 --> 04:28.700
Nothing wrong
with your shape either, huh?

04:30.704 --> 04:33.105
Tell me, do those glasses work?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.366
Oh, yeah, this is my idea.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.136
I figured I'd give my eyes
a rest, you know?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.872
I mean, what I need now
is I need to be very comfy.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.676
That's it, just nice and comfy.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.342
(others gasp)

04:49.289 --> 04:50.654
That was... that was good, Fonz.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.952
MARION:
Well, dinner's ready.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.082
- I'll go carve the lamb.
- All right.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.625
I'll bring you a tray, Arthur.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.753
Oh, no, Mrs. C.,
I'm eating with the family.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.697
I can make it.
I know my way around.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.496
- Oh, sure, Fonz. Yeah, you got
it. -Oh, sure, Fonz. Sure. Yeah.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.571
- HOWARD: Uh, Fonzie... -Fonz.
- Uh, uh, uh, Fonz. -Uh, Fonz.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.571
Got you, got you, got you.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.698
I'm right here.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.674
The vegetables look outstanding.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.376
I'm ready.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.747
Okay.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.854
Now, I thought
we would start the meal

05:21.988 --> 05:24.582
with a nice healthful glass
of carrot juice.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.250
Oh. Carrot juice?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.520
Richard.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.256
Right, carrot juice.
Good for the eyesight.

05:31.398 --> 05:36.302
This is to my favorite
middle class American family.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.799
Hey, this is great stuff,
Mrs. C.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.375
I can see...
I can see better already.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.274
- The gravy! Well, that's...
- JOANIE: Oh.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.073
- MARION: That was a really nice
toast... -FONZIE: Thank you.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.409
-...Arthur.
- Hmm. -Yeah.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.209
Hey, listen, uh,
if nobody minds,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.375
I'm gonna help myself
to some veggies, all right?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.248
Oh, why don't you just let me
get them for you, Fonz?

05:54.387 --> 05:57.687
- I want to get 'em myself, Rich.
-|... Well, I could reach 'em...

05:58.725 --> 06:00.557
There we go.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.322
Hey, how am I doing?

06:03.463 --> 06:04.658
<i>Great.
Great.</i>

06:04.798 --> 06:06.493
Yeah. I don't got a problem.
Anybody else now?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.226
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.836
Boy, you're really hungry, huh?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.870
- Long time between feedings?
- Uh-huh.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.872
Okay, lamb is all carved.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.601
- MARION: Oh.
- RICHIE: Ah, great.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.837
Richie, would you like
to give some to Fonz?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.243
Sure. Can I, uh,
serve you some lamb, Fonz?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.180
- I'd rather do it myself, huh?
-(grunts)

06:26.119 --> 06:28.816
I think I hit a bone here.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.792
You did, Fonzie.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.590
Uh, would you just go
for a piece to the left, please?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.721
Just, uh, up and over.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.333
- JOANIE: Oh.
- How'd I do, huh?

06:42.469 --> 06:43.493
I got it, see?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.072
I told you I had no problem.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.606
More lamb, Fonz?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.646
No, I think I had sufficient.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.271
- Thanks.
- Okay.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.977
Mrs. C,
this is a most memorable meal.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.612
It was for me, too, Fonz.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.281
For all of us, Fonzie.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.688
Is-is it all right now if I just
kind of clear the table?

07:06.826 --> 07:08.419
- Oh, we'll-we'll take care
of the dishes. -No. -No.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.188
No, Mom promised
that I could do them.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.424
- Yes.
- Boy, am I lucky.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.896
(doorbell rings)

07:14.034 --> 07:16.059
Oh, there's my date.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.632
Fonzie, you've got a date?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.865
- Yeah.
- Now, listen, Fonz, maybe

07:21.007 --> 07:22.566
you should just stay
with us tonight.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.201
Hey, hey,
I handpicked this one myself.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.913
Is-is this chick dressed
all in white?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.414
RICHIE:
Yeah, she is.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.018
It's the right one.
All right.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.780
I'll see you later. Whoa.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.020
<i>RICHIE:
Another day, another dollar.</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:39.216
Of course, I'm not working,

07:39.359 --> 07:40.918
so nobody's actually
giving me a dollar,

07:41.061 --> 07:42.551
but you know what I'm saying.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.027
Yeah.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.690
Yeah, it's just a great day
to be alive, isn't it?

07:46.833 --> 07:47.925
Yeah.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.036
Well, you ready
to start off the morning

07:50.170 --> 07:52.104
with a good hearty breakfast?

07:52.238 --> 07:54.138
I'm not hungry.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.971
Oh. Well, that-that happens.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.976
I think I'm gonna get a bite.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.807
Uh, tell you what,
I'll bring you back some coffee.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.381
- How's that sound?
- Don't leave here.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.210
Why not?

08:04.351 --> 08:07.446
I'm scared.

08:09.956 --> 08:13.256
Fonzie... scared?

08:14.294 --> 08:17.457
Richie...

08:17.597 --> 08:19.998
I'm blind.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.136
<i>RALPH:
Al, listen, did you know</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:35.543
<i>that Rich was bringing
the Fonz over'?</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:37.172
<i>And this is his
first time out since...</i>

08:37.317 --> 08:39.649
I know, Ralph, but if I only
knew there was a chance

08:39.785 --> 08:42.517
that Fonzie'd be able to see
again, an outside chance even.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.623
Well, there is.
My dad explained it to me.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.159
Now, listen, what Fonzie's got
is optic neuritis.

08:47.293 --> 08:51.730
And with treatments...
he could get his sight back.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.334
Ralph, that's wonderful news.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.462
But then again,
it could be permanent.

09:00.673 --> 09:03.404
All right, all right,
listen up. It's Fonzie!

09:03.543 --> 09:05.534
- All right.
-(crowd cheering)

09:13.219 --> 09:15.984
Well, how does it feel to be
back at Arnold's, huh, Fonz?

09:16.122 --> 09:17.954
Yeah, everything's just
exactly the same.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.650
Oh, why don't we sit down here

09:19.793 --> 09:21.318
and have a soda
or something, huh?

09:21.461 --> 09:22.792
Just-just right over here,

09:22.929 --> 09:24.829
just at our regular,
old, normal booth.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.932
There it is, Fonz.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.161
Good. There you go.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.202
Hi, Fonz.

09:31.337 --> 09:34.238
Hey. Al?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.365
How you doing, Al?

09:37.977 --> 09:40.878
Yeah, it's me, Al, your friend.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.984
("Vinéfli
The man who made you blind.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.381
Al, Al, Al, listen up.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.078
It's not your fault.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.122
I've been taking my chance
for years by eating here.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.521
(Richie chuckles)

09:53.660 --> 09:55.128
- Al?
- Yeah, Fonz?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.729
I want you
to do something for me.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.058
I'd do anything, Fonz.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.688
Do you want me to leave town?
I'll do it.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.267
You want me to adopt you?
I'll do it.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.995
- Al... -Do you want me
to shut up? I'll do it!

10:04.137 --> 10:06.538
Come here.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.904
I want you to forgive yourself,
see, 'cause I have.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.909
You understand?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.605
Thanks, Fonz.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.442
If I only could.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.817
Fonz, ready to, uh, talk
to some more friends, huh?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.047
No.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.157
Look, uh,
Potsie and Ralph are over here.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.725
You just stay right here.
I'll get them.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.259
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on, talk to the Fonz, okay?

10:28.394 --> 10:30.055
He's right over here.
He really wants to talk to you.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.028
Oh, say hi to the Fonz for me,
Rich, okay?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.293
Say hi to him yourself.
He's right here.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.425
(Potsie chuckles faintly)

10:37.704 --> 10:39.672
Hi, Fonz.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.672
Uh...

10:41.808 --> 10:44.937
you see the new
Playboy centerfold?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.241
It wasn't very good, you know.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.115
Uh, fat staples
covered everything. (chuckles)

10:55.421 --> 10:57.515
(groans)

10:57.657 --> 11:00.649
Uh, hey, Ralph, all right,
look, tell Fonzie a joke.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.192
I mean,
you've always got a good one.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.386
Yeah, yeah, come on here.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.862
- Yeah, come on.
- So true. So true.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.797
Okay, all right, all right.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.561
Here's an oldie, but a goodie.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.067
Oh, good. A goodie, okay.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.070
All right, what's this?
What's this?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.867
You give up? (laughs)

11:15.008 --> 11:17.602
That's a spider
doing pushups, huh? Uh...

11:21.514 --> 11:23.107
That's not really a funny joke.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.809
L-I didn't ever like that
that much.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.681
- Cunningham?
- RICHIE: Yeah, Fonz?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.185
- You here?
- I'm right here.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.723
- Get me out of here. -Oh, no,
you don't want to leave yet.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.155
Take me home, huh?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.886
- Uh, Fonz, you know what this
place needs to liven it up? -No.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.154
Is just, uh, a little music.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.424
- Right? -Right, right.
I don't have any change.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.158
So-so why don't you do
the jukebox bit?

11:40.300 --> 11:43.736
- Oh, yeah, Fonz, do the jukebox.
- Yeah, Fonz, you can do that.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.996
- Yeah, I can do that.
- He's gonna do it!

11:45.138 --> 11:46.299
- I can do that.
- All right, Fonz.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.600
-(cheering)
- All right, Fonzie!

11:47.740 --> 11:48.935
- I'll get you over there.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.099
I can find it. I can find it.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.438
- All right.
- It's all right.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.739
Right.
Y-You're doing great, Fonz.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.369
- Hey, hey.
- He-He's gonna do it now.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.004
(excited chatter)

11:56.149 --> 11:57.639
All right, here you go, Fonz.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.219
- No one does it like you, Fonz.
- The tap. That's right.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.582
POTSIE:
All right. Hey.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.950
I could do this blindfolded.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.080
- RICHIE: That's right.
-(others chuckle)

12:12.865 --> 12:14.230
♪ Shaboom, shaboom... ♪

12:14.367 --> 12:15.926

- RICHIE: Yeah.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.195

- Get me out of here!

12:17.337 --> 12:18.498
- All right.
- Fonz...

12:18.638 --> 12:19.730
- Cunningham!
- I got you.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.601
You said it was gonna be
the same. You lied to me!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.902
- It's gonna be fine.
- It's not the same.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.874
- Fonzie, trust me, please!
- It's not the same!

<i>MARION: Would you like
some potatoes, Arthur?</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:31.513
Oh, yes, thanks very much,
Mrs. C.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.676
HOWARD: Richard,
how did the game come out today?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.618
RICHIE:
I hate touch football.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.154
HOWARD:
You lost, huh?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.485
RICHIE:
You could say that.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.787
The game was called
on account of humiliation.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.225
Joanie, you're not
sitting down yet, are you?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.229
Oh. No, Fonz.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.027
Could you find my knife, put
a little butter on it, please?

12:48.167 --> 12:50.067
JOANIE: Oh. I'll just
butter your roll, Fonz.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.329
FONZIE:
Thanks.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.337
You know, I remember
when I played intramural sports.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.634
There was one game

12:54.774 --> 12:56.936
-in touch football...
-ls there any salt on the table?

12:57.076 --> 12:58.976
Fonzie, why don't you just
reach out for it?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.774
It's right in front of you
and a little bit to the right.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.015
What were you saying, Dad?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.549
What do you want salted, Fonzie?

13:09.689 --> 13:12.215
Well, two shakes on the spuds,

13:12.358 --> 13:14.759
one on the succotash.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.623
Oh, never mind,
everything tastes the same

13:16.763 --> 13:18.162
when you're blind, anyway.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.393
Aw, come on, Fonz.
Now, you know that's not true.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.935
So just go ahead, please,
try and eat something, okay?

13:24.070 --> 13:27.335
Well, I guess you're right.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.168
Someone help me with my fork.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.710
- Of course.
- No, Mom, no.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.313
Doctor said Fonzie's got
to start doing some things

13:34.447 --> 13:35.676
for himself now.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.340
Yeah, that's great.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.180
The doctor says he's
treating me, I'm still blind.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.017
Well, he's trying, Fonz.
Why don't you?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.284
Look, your fork--
it's right here.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.688
Everything's in
its normal place.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.316
And the food--
we talked about that, right?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.190
I mean, the vegetables
up here at ten o'clock,

13:50.330 --> 13:51.820
the meat's at two o'clock
and the potatoes

13:51.964 --> 13:53.398
are right down here
at six o'clock.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.194
Now, it's all arranged
for you, Fonz.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.099
Ten o'clock, two o'clock,
six o'clock.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.635
It's easy for you; you can see.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.206
This is ridiculous, Fonzie!

14:01.341 --> 14:02.831
I mean, you used to say

14:02.975 --> 14:04.841
you could put an entire
engine together blindfolded.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.741
- That's true.
- Now you can't find your fork?

14:06.879 --> 14:10.144
Richard, now, let's not
upset Arthur's dinner.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.375
Yeah, Richie.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.679
Fonzie, last week
you were trying.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.151
I mean, you-you
couldn't see then,

14:15.288 --> 14:16.346
but you were independent.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.253
It's different;
now it's permanent.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.019
We don't know that
for certain, Fonzie.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.356
Dad, there's a very good chance
he may never see again.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.157
Cut it out, Richie.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.561
Please, Richard.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.327
Arthur needs time to learn
how to do things for himself.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.062
So when's he gonna start, Mom?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.866
He'll start when
he makes the adjustment.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.701
Right now, he needs our help.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.571
Help is fine.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.178
But he's just
got to try himself!

14:39.312 --> 14:40.541
And you can do it, Fonz.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.774
Look, there's a saying:

14:42.915 --> 14:45.179
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going."

14:45.318 --> 14:47.343
Well, that's just
a very cute expression

14:47.487 --> 14:49.581
when you're playing
silly intramural games.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.656
This is life.
And this conversation is over.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.589
Finis. The end. You understand?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.592
Joanie, would you
help me upstairs, please?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.787
- I'm a little too upset to eat.
- Help me!

14:57.930 --> 14:59.523
Salt me, pick up my fork.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.827
Fonzie, I never thought
I would ever say this to you...

15:01.968 --> 15:03.265
but you're a coward.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.495
You call me a coward?

15:04.637 --> 15:06.105
Yeah, you want me
to help myself?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.604
- Yes! -All right,
I'll help myself. There!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.708
That's what happens when
I help myself! You see that?!

15:09.842 --> 15:11.936
I'm useless! I'm blind!

15:12.078 --> 15:15.013
You may be blind, Fonz,
but let me tell you something.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.742
It's your decision
to be useless.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.957
<i>JQANE:
Okay, Fonz, in the first panel,</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:36.728
Dagwood is stretched out
on the couch sleeping.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.031
Is he dreaming about
sawing a log in half

15:39.172 --> 15:41.334
or are there just a bunch
of "Zs" over his head?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.966
Oh, just "Zs."
I-It's the Katzenjammer Kids

15:44.110 --> 15:45.942
-who saw the logs.
- Yeah. Right, right, right.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.910
- Okay, the next panel...
- Fonzie?

15:48.047 --> 15:48.912
- Yeah?
- It's me.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.072
So what?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.650
Keep going.
What else happens there?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.809
- Okay. He gets up...
- Joanie, uh,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.443
I'd like to be alone
with Fonzie, please,

15:55.588 --> 15:56.714
if you don't mind.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.753
Is it okay, Fonzie?

15:59.892 --> 16:01.053
Yeah.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.162
All right.
I'll be right downstairs,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.663
and when you're ready
to do the crossword puzzle,

16:05.798 --> 16:07.596
I'll be there, okay?

16:07.733 --> 16:09.861
Yeah.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.993
You be nice.

16:16.175 --> 16:20.373
Well, Fonz, I just, uh,
brought you a present.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.210
Yeah? You're trying to make up,
I ain't buying it.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.215
Well, wait till you find out
what it is, Fonz.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.477
I think you're gonna like it.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.553
We went to a lot of trouble
to get it for you.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.553
What do you mean "we"?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.748
Who else is in my room here?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.727
It's...

16:35.862 --> 16:37.762
It's nobody, right, Biff?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.422
(deep voice):
Right, Duke.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.533
Come on.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.294
Is that Ralph and Potsie?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.361
Fonz, please don't hit us.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.529
We didn't mean to do it.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.140
I'm telling you,
Richie made me do it.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.469
- We're pawns.
- Pawns?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.737
We're dead men!
Let's get out of here, Malph!

16:51.878 --> 16:54.404
No names, Potsie!

16:54.547 --> 16:57.039
What's going on here, Rich?
What's happening here?

16:57.183 --> 17:01.017
Well, we thought, uh, you'd like
to have your motorcycle

17:01.153 --> 17:03.588
-up here with you.
- Heyyy.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.323
My bike doesn't go
clackety-clack.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.398
Yeah, well, it, uh...
it does now.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.127
See you around.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.240
I hate your guts, Cunningham!
You hear me?!

17:23.376 --> 17:26.402
- I hate your guts!
-(metal clanking)

17:26.546 --> 17:29.538
How could they do this to you?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.350
How could you
do this to me, huh?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.751
I thought
I was your favorite person.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.880
(exhaling sharply)

17:49.001 --> 17:50.992
My bike.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.202
Carburetor.

17:56.342 --> 17:59.573
Hello, little carburetor.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.043
Wait a minute.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.148
(metal clanking)

18:03.282 --> 18:05.580
Yeah.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.379
You two parts shouldn't be...

18:07.520 --> 18:09.386
There you go.
You should be together, huh?

18:09.522 --> 18:10.990
Doesn't that feel better?

18:11.123 --> 18:12.613
Yeah.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.624
All right, look, don't go away.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.592
I'm just gonna get my toolbox.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.720
I'll be right back.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.775
Is that you?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.905
It's me.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.313
Well?

18:40.453 --> 18:42.979
Well, it's, uh...

18:43.122 --> 18:44.681
it's terrific.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.690
Yeah.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.761
It's a great expression,
you know?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.956
When the, uh, going gets tough,
the tough get going.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.466
Yeah, it is. You know, I...

18:55.601 --> 18:57.865
wish I'd said it.
(chuckles)

18:58.004 --> 18:59.301
You did.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.631
Thanks.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.535
I've been doing
a lot of thinking, you know?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.338
Maybe I'm wasting
a lot of time here.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.948
I mean, I got a whole life
ahead of me, you know?

19:09.081 --> 19:11.880
I got hands to work,
lips to play.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.485
I-I'd like my jacket.

19:15.621 --> 19:19.080
- Would you get me my jacket,
please? -Got it. You got it.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.886
All right.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.552
This is the Fonz talking now.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.686
- Here's your jacket.
- Thanks.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.327
I feel better already.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.461
- Yeah, well, you look great.
- Yeah.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.040
I think now
I'm in business here.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.266
(both chuckle)

19:36.409 --> 19:37.706
Thanks.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.505
I'm still very scared, you know.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.240
I know. I know, Fonz.
But you're not gonna be alone.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.441
There are a lot of organizations
in Milwaukee

19:45.584 --> 19:47.052
that are gonna...
are gonna help you.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.349
Well, maybe I can get
a seeing eye chick.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.150
(chuckles)

19:52.291 --> 19:54.316
As long as she ain't a dog.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.791
Yeah, right.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.623
Well, I'm sure you're gonna have
plenty of volunteers.

19:57.763 --> 20:01.461
And... and if you need us...

20:01.600 --> 20:04.626
well, then you got a family
downstairs that...

20:04.770 --> 20:06.397
loves you very much.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.530
Hey.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.868
What do you say, you and me,
we go down to Arnold's?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.004
- That's an idea.
- Yeah? You like that idea?

20:16.148 --> 20:18.082
All right, look, uh, the door
is right over here, Fonz.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.412
I know where the door is.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.748
I've been-been finding it
for three years now.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.355
- Oh, right.
- Huh? Look at that.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.355
- I got the door, right? Huh?
-(chuckles)

20:25.491 --> 20:27.482
Door's open.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.258
You're a terrific buddy.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.528
Thanks.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.195
This is, uh...

20:39.338 --> 20:41.705
very hard for me to say.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.935
Well-well, then, listen,
you don't have to say it, Fonz.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.066
Yes, I do.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.237
No, you don't
have to say it. You...

20:48.380 --> 20:51.315
Well... go ahead.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.650
Cunningham...

20:54.787 --> 20:55.913
Yeah, Fonz.

20:56.055 --> 20:59.514
...if you ever
touch my bike again,

20:59.658 --> 21:02.150
I'm gonna disconnect
your freckles.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.327
Aw, you didn't have
to say that, Fonz.

21:07.466 --> 21:08.934
You got a deal.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.331
All right. Let's go.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.460
All right.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.511
Oh, I'm so proud of Arthur.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.514
The instructor said
he's learning so fast,

21:24.650 --> 21:26.641
he's already getting around
with his cane.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.515
(chuckles) And girls, too.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.055
He had a lot
of catching up to do.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.852
Well, he closed
Inspiration Point to the public.

21:35.494 --> 21:36.791
Oh, Richard.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.397
Arthur!

21:38.531 --> 21:41.523
- Hi, Fonz. -Hi, Fonz.
- Hey, folks.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.197
Nice to see you, Mrs. C.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.203
Well, it's nice
to see you, Arthur.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.068
Hey, Joanie, you look great.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.199
Oh, Fonz, I-l look a mess.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.675
I think pink looks
very good on you.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.373
Arthur, you can see!

21:56.515 --> 21:59.007
- Fonzie!
- Yeah. Yeah. I can see!

21:59.151 --> 22:00.812
I mean, look, I was going
to the doctor, right,

22:00.953 --> 22:02.978
for a regular treatment, and
he starts playing with my eyes,

22:03.122 --> 22:04.920
you know?
And all of a sudden, bang,

22:05.057 --> 22:07.116
I could see shapes
and colors, you know?

22:07.259 --> 22:09.318
Oh, what beautiful colors.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.589
- Now, everything is still
a little fuzzy, -RICHIE: Yeah.

22:11.730 --> 22:14.256
But he says that, uh,
if I continue to go

22:14.400 --> 22:16.596
and I go for my treatments,
in just a few days,

22:16.735 --> 22:18.464
- I should be back to normal,
you know? -HOWARD: Oh.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.094
-100%.
- JOANIE: Oh.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.400
What a relief.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.269
You want to talk about relief,
you ought to see Al.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.468
- He's still draped over
the pinball machine. -(laughter)

22:25.611 --> 22:27.807
- Oh, wait till I tell everybody.
- Oh. Oh, I have to tell Jenny.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.540
- Everybody wants to know what
happened. -(excited chatter)

22:29.682 --> 22:32.151
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Everybody, come back here.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.275
I want to say something.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.849
Yeah.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.756
What I want to say is that,
uh, well...

22:41.894 --> 22:42.861
I think he wants to say...

22:42.995 --> 22:46.329
I know what I want to say.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.433
First of all,
I want to say thanks.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.537
Second of all...

22:51.670 --> 22:53.536
I want to say
that I'm very happy

22:53.672 --> 22:55.663
that you're all
a part of my life.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.176
-(chuckles)
- Oh, Arthur. -Aw.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.724
FONZIE:
To the stairway.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.057
- To the stairway.
- Fonz, Fonz.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.689
- What? -We already toasted
the stairway.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.063
We've done the whole house.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.603
Let me tell you something,
you've been in darkness like me

23:25.738 --> 23:28.070
for a week,
everything looks fabuloso.

23:28.207 --> 23:31.040
- Arthur's right.
Let's keep on toasting. -Right.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.405
-(doorbell rings) -FONZIE:
To the doorbell. -JOANIE: Oh.

23:32.544 --> 23:33.477
To the doorbell.

23:33.612 --> 23:34.875
I'll get it.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.210
I got it.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.374
Hey, Rich...

23:39.518 --> 23:41.714
All right, Fonz,
don't kill them.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.050
- Uh, they meant very well.
-(doorbell rings)

23:44.189 --> 23:47.386
(sighs) I understand.
I understand, Mr. C.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.051
All right, I'll be gentle.

23:49.194 --> 23:50.787
- Don't say a word, all right?
- Well...

23:50.930 --> 23:53.922
Let them in. Let them in.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.929
- RICHIE: Let them in?
- Let them in.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.932
- Hi, guys. Come on in.
- Hey, Rich.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.665
- Hello, Warren.
- Mrs. C.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.071
- Mr. C., Joanie.
- Mrs. C.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.837
Hey, everybody. Hey, Fonz.

24:06.979 --> 24:10.415
Fonz, Fonz,
have we got a surprise for you.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.950
Hey, that's great 'cause I got
a surprise for you, too.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.577
Oh. Come on, Fonz,
ours first, all right?

24:15.721 --> 24:17.086
All right, all right, go first.

24:17.222 --> 24:20.055
All right, Fonz...
(chuckles)

24:20.192 --> 24:22.388
we took your bike apart again!

24:22.528 --> 24:24.189
More therapy.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.820
Yep.

24:25.965 --> 24:26.932
My turn?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.659
- Sure.
- Sure. (chuckles)

24:28.801 --> 24:30.860
Richie, why don't you toss me
one of those oranges

24:31.003 --> 24:32.164
on the table over there.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.465
Oh, sure, Fonz.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.074
Here you go.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.266
Thanks.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.343
Hey, Fonz,
that's really terrific.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.709
Thank you.

24:42.848 --> 24:45.340
Whoop. Whoop.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.349
Whoop.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.681
Potsie, he can see! He can see!

24:48.821 --> 24:50.755
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here!
