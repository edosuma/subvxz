00:18.051 --> 00:19.518
Come on!

00:21.888 --> 00:25.289
Personal best. Cutler.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.518
Yeah!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.560
- April?
- Yeah!

00:32.732 --> 00:34.359
April.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.241
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Oh, believe it. Dreams are coming true.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.469
Now, no more talking. Set the mood.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.049
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

00:51.217 --> 00:55.017
I know I said no more talking,
but I got one more thing to say.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.222
This is probably the best day of my life.

00:59.826 --> 01:03.125
I just thought you should know that
before you go any further.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.287
Thank you, Kenny. I'm happy too.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.194
Okay. Now get naked.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.669
Fuck that button.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.838
Are you ready?

01:20.380 --> 01:22.177
Okay.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.805
- You're about to break my damn hand.
- Well?

01:51.544 --> 01:53.978
- Ninety-eight.
- Fuck me.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.342
This is seriously
the best wave of good shit...

01:56.516 --> 01:58.245
...that has ever happened in my life.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.010
I knock out Mackworthy's eye...

02:00.186 --> 02:02.780
...then I see April's big-ass tits
and have sex to her.

02:02.956 --> 02:07.655
It's like all the horrible, disgusting shit I
had to put up with here is finally paying off.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.091
- Sounds pretty good, man.
- Kenny Powers.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.463
Who the fuck are you?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.364
I'm your dad. I'm just kidding.
Your dad's dead.

02:17.870 --> 02:20.031
- I don't fucking know you.
- I'm Pat Anderson.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.868
I'm the assistant
to the assistant GM for Tampa.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.033
- You got a fucked-up sense of humor.
- Sorry.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.111
- You got credentials, pal?
- Credentials?

02:27.747 --> 02:29.681
Yeah, I got some credentials.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.047
Business account, of course.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.780
What's black? Is black better than gold?

02:37.624 --> 02:42.152
Yeah. Gold might get you
Jonas Brothers tickets, black...

02:42.328 --> 02:44.523
...involve three of them
sucking your dick.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.730
- I'm listening.
- You're internet hot, Kenny.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.494
The video of you
knocking Reg Mackworthy's eye out...

02:50.670 --> 02:54.162
...will pass a million views
by the time I finish this sentence.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.776
I'm sure that your phone's ringing
off the hook with major-league offers.

02:57.944 --> 03:00.276
- Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah? Well, I can't say...

03:00.446 --> 03:03.677
...I'm surprised to hear that,
but I don't think they can offer you...

03:03.850 --> 03:05.317
...what Tampa can offer you.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.453
Now, I'm not gonna
bullshit you guys, okay?

03:07.620 --> 03:10.748
Attendance is down, and the franchise
needs a shot of personality...

03:10.923 --> 03:13.824
...so I need to ask you
a very important question...

03:13.993 --> 03:19.397
...and I need you to be 100 percent
motherfucking honest with me, okay?

03:19.799 --> 03:20.959
I don't use steroids.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.763
No. What I need to know is,
all that racist, homophobic talk...

03:24.937 --> 03:27.405
...that you used to be known for.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.267
Has that changed at all?

03:31.044 --> 03:35.572
Well, to tell you the truth,
I've changed a lot since I left baseball.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.216
I learned a lot of lessons and shit...

03:38.384 --> 03:41.148
...and I'm pretty much,
in a lot of ways, a brand-new man.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.518
But, yeah, that stuff is still all the same.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.550
Perfect. Perfect. Okay.

03:48.728 --> 03:53.131
I can't talk numbers right now,
but rest assured, Kenny, it's gonna be big.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.927
Okay, we're talking huge. Okay?

03:56.102 --> 03:57.535
- Okay. I like it.
- All right.

03:57.704 --> 04:01.299
- So you ready to get down with this party?
- I'm ready to butt-fuck this party.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.271
All right, let's fuck. Let's fuck.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.206
- Let's fucking fuck each other.
- Now.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.778
- Yeah.
- Let's fucking get down and start fucking.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.906
- On your knees.
- In front of the kids.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.745
Yeah, let's fuck the kids.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.246
- That's going too far.
- No.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.581
- Those are my nephews.
- I'm not gonna do that.

04:16.755 --> 04:20.192
- That's not funny to fuck kids.
- Well, look, sorry about that.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.092
So, what do you say?
You wanna get with this party?

04:25.098 --> 04:28.067
- Sealed with a handshake.
- Welcome back, Kenny Powers.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.395
- Kenny Powers is fucking back.
- You are back.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.401
- Now, is this for real, man?
- It's real.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.563
Seriously.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.602
It's true.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.774
I don't know.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.642
I mean, he has run away before
when he's gotten sad...

04:42.815 --> 04:47.252
...but never for this long,
and without even just-

04:49.188 --> 04:50.450
I'm back.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.259
- What is this?
- It's a Denali.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.661
- You wanna know how I got it?
- Not really right now, Kenny.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.026
I am trying to figure out where Cutler is.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.502
I'm going back to the big show.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.136
- What?
- Major leagues, cupcake.

05:07.640 --> 05:12.134
Tampa sent their finest man to my home
to personally sign me for next season.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.835
I'm back on top.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.072
Well, that's great, Kenny.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.308
- But you already bought a car?
- Bought?

05:18.484 --> 05:19.508
No, I didn't buy that.

05:19.685 --> 05:22.745
Two-year lease. Yeah, I threw
the old truck in for a down payment.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.288
I'm gonna be paid
before the first note comes in.

05:25.758 --> 05:28.249
Well, I sort of expected this,
you know, 10 years ago.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.952
I thought you said you changed.

05:30.563 --> 05:33.623
Okay, you're not really
getting what I'm saying here.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.859
So how about this?

05:38.070 --> 05:39.401
Come with me.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.835
- What?
- I want you to come to Tampa with me.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.273
I made the mistake
of leaving you behind before...

05:45.445 --> 05:47.913
...and I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna do it again.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.272
Fuck all that fine Cuban pussy.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.078
Your olive skin bests that
any day of the week.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.477
I'm doing it right this time.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.316
We're doing it together.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.987
Kenny, I can't even begin
to start thinking about this now.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.355
Cutler has been gone for three days.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.464
Don't ruin this good time
with that baby's behavior. All right?

06:06.632 --> 06:10.796
Just let it soak in. You don't have to give
me an answer right now. Just sleep on it.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.063
Then get back to me.

06:15.107 --> 06:18.873
If you need me,
I'll be cruising in my Escalade, man. Denali.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.814
Terrence?

06:25.251 --> 06:28.709
Terrence! Where are you going?

06:28.888 --> 06:30.355
Come back!

06:31.157 --> 06:32.317
Come back.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.859
So if anyone has any knowledge
of the whereabouts of Principal Cutler...

06:36.028 --> 06:38.223
...please let a member
of the faculty know.

06:38.397 --> 06:42.993
Also, please disregard any rumors
regarding Principal Cutler's absence.

06:43.169 --> 06:46.104
Okay, we get it. Cutler went crazy.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.569
So as I was saying...

06:47.740 --> 06:50.834
...the money I'm gonna be making
would hurt your parents' feelings.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.774
Remember the class where I
taught you how to make it rain?

06:54.180 --> 06:57.513
That's what I'm gonna be doing
every single night.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.776
Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.712
Now, my replacement
comes very highly qualified.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.256
And please, please, please,
don't let the fact...

07:06.425 --> 07:08.689
...that Miss Carol's a lesbian
put you off to her.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.386
You know how you think
there are two kinds of lesbians?

07:11.564 --> 07:15.625
There's the kind on Cinemax that get it on
and are hot, and there's the mean kind?

07:15.801 --> 07:18.998
Miss Carol is neither of those.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.670
Before I go,
I don't wanna leave you empty-handed.

07:21.841 --> 07:25.902
I'm gonna be signing a personalized
headshot for each and every one of you.

07:26.078 --> 07:29.411
The only thing I would ask, is that
you would have your name prepared...

07:29.582 --> 07:33.882
...because I don't wanna have to ask
the same question 30 fucking times.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.783
- There you go, buddy.
- Thanks, coach.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.287
You're welcome.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.290
Hi. Could you make it out to Steven?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.223
It would be my honor.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.523
You know,
I knew that this day would come.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.428
Well, I couldn't have done it
without you, Stevie.

07:48.601 --> 07:51.331
We are gonna have
so much fun in Tampa.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.965
- What'd you say?
- I put my apartment on Craigslist.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.336
It's all happening, Kenny.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.172
- You think you're coming.
- Of course I'm coming with you.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.144
Why would I not?
I mean, fuck all this small-town shit.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.649
You think I'm gonna leave you just
when you need my assistance the most?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.787
Kenny, no fucking way.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.321
Where you go, I follow.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.548
Right, Kenny?

08:13.459 --> 08:15.017
Right, Kenny?

08:15.194 --> 08:18.857
Yeah, right. I mean, what's Tampa gonna be
without my assistant there...

08:19.031 --> 08:21.898
...to make reservations
at all the hottest nightclubs in town?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.365
You know what I read online?

08:23.536 --> 08:27.404
That Tampa has the best titty bars
in the nation...

08:27.573 --> 08:30.906
...and I'm gonna set up pussy appointments
for you all the fucking time.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.238
- Tons of pussy appointments.
- Oh, fuck yeah.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.606
Can I have that?

08:34.981 --> 08:36.174
There you go, buddy.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.179
Fucking Tampa. Tampa.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.513
Tampa, yeah.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.053
Goodbye, fucking shit school.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.214
See you fucking morons later...

08:46.392 --> 08:50.726
...because I'm going to Tampa
to suck some titties.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.465
When I'm gone,
you need to look after this place, man.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.360
I mean, this is our hometown.
This shithole helped shape us.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.870
You must guard it
and protect its royal vagina.

09:02.808 --> 09:03.866
I will.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.476
You want some of this?

09:05.645 --> 09:07.408
No.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.851
I have enjoyed getting fucked up
with you here, Clegg.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.281
It's crazy, man.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.887
How our journey here
is basically coming to an end.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.787
You know, I'm going on
to fucking bigger and better things...

09:21.027 --> 09:23.723
...and you're gonna probably
just stick around back here...

09:23.896 --> 09:27.764
...just still doing, you know,
the stuff that you're doing.

09:27.933 --> 09:30.731
The time spent with you is crucial...

09:30.903 --> 09:34.031
...to me getting through
all the bullshit I needed to get through.

09:34.206 --> 09:37.073
- Awesome.
- I'll always be in debt to you.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.302
You know,
I hope that there's some way...

09:39.478 --> 09:42.413
...I could pay you back
for what you've done for me here.

09:42.581 --> 09:47.575
Well, maybe you could start paying me back
for that eight ball from the other night.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.088
You said that we would split it.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.455
Well, you wanna do some now?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.921
I'd love to.

10:25.591 --> 10:28.822
Eat up, baby.
I paid him 20 bucks to do that for you.

10:28.994 --> 10:32.088
- That's nice, Kenny, thank you.
- Thanks, Gabriel.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.363
That's not the only trick Kenny Powers
has up his sleeve this eve.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.238
Open it.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.807
Kenny, I think we maybe just should-

10:43.976 --> 10:45.967
Open the box.

10:51.517 --> 10:55.112
Don't get into how much it costs,
I don't want you to get into some contest...

10:55.287 --> 10:58.779
-... with your girlfriends, but-
- I can't go to Tampa with you.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.954
I can't go to Tampa with you.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.223
Gabriel, hit me up with the shrimp.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.862
Are you out of your fucking mind, April?

11:11.036 --> 11:13.197
My goddamn fiancÃ© is missing.

11:13.372 --> 11:16.500
Kenny, I admit it. That I have
feelings for you that I can't ignore.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.905
Something about you
that does something to me.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.138
April, I know all this, okay?
But I do like hearing it, so go on.

11:22.314 --> 11:25.545
Back in high school,
I would've followed you anywhere...

11:26.085 --> 11:27.814
...but things are different now.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.319
This is my life.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.858
Maybe if you stayed in town
we could see what happens.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.655
Listen here, you beautiful bitch,
I'm about to fuck you up with some truth.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.688
I can't do this without you.
And I will admit that.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.701
I mean, yeah, sure, I got my pitch back,
but it's unproven, April.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.865
And that makes me scared.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.075
But for some reason,
when you're with me...

11:51.243 --> 11:53.643
...it gives me the feeling
like I can pull this off.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.145
Like I can roll the fucking dice.

11:58.651 --> 12:03.213
I'm just not ready to take
that risk of my life on that gamble.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.722
What the fuck does that even mean?
The risk of the life with the gamble?

12:06.892 --> 12:10.328
- What?
- I'm not ready to risk my life on a gamble.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.657
Oh, so, what?
All this just boils down to...

12:13.833 --> 12:17.599
...some stupid sort of fucking retaliation
for high school.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.199
Whatever.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.033
I get it.

12:22.575 --> 12:27.706
For your information,
that watch cost $6000.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.316
Don't miss me when I'm on TV.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.838
Cutler.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.736
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Okay, relax.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.741
Let's relax here.
Just hold on a second.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.107
- What's the white cloth for?
- Let's calm down.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.374
Calm down a second.
You're getting excited.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.518
And that's not gonna help the situation.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.744
A lot of people are feeling
things right now.

13:08.921 --> 13:12.448
Let's just get our feelings out there,
and talk it through and calm down.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.083
I've been a little bit upset.
I've mostly been out in the woods.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.958
It's not normal for me
to live out in the woods.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.361
I've been going a little bit of crazy.

13:21.533 --> 13:25.196
I think maybe I'm just trying
to wrap my brain around...

13:25.371 --> 13:29.705
...what it means when I hear that something
has happened between you and April.

13:30.743 --> 13:35.942
Look, Cutler, I know you must be torn up
knowing that I had sex with your fiancÃ©e.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.242
Wait. No, no, no.
You didn't have sex with her.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.045
You didn't say it. No.
I just heard you kissed her.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.744
You didn't have sex with her. No.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.283
Oh, God.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.481
I'm gonna puke.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.355
Look, there's something else
you should know as well.

13:50.262 --> 13:52.196
- I've really lost her.
- No, you-

13:52.364 --> 13:54.332
Look. You win.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.261
I asked her to come with me
to Tampa and she said no.

13:58.437 --> 14:02.134
Said she had a life here, so...

14:02.541 --> 14:04.236
You got her.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.375
Kenny, I don't know how-

14:07.546 --> 14:09.946
I don't know how to feel about that, I...

14:10.115 --> 14:12.811
You won, motherfucker. You won.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.146
I did not see that coming.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.050
Yeah, quite frankly, I didn't either.

14:17.222 --> 14:22.592
I mean, no offense, but you got a shitty job,
you're not quite as tall as me-

14:22.761 --> 14:24.922
- Yeah.
- Nobody really respects you.

14:25.097 --> 14:28.157
You have me, on the other hand.
I got the glory, I got the fame...

14:28.334 --> 14:30.632
...the money, the jewels,
the cash, the Denali.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.771
- Right.
- Getting drunk on the reg...

14:32.938 --> 14:36.840
...fucking good times on the reg,
yachts on the reg, sex on the reg-

14:37.009 --> 14:40.069
- Okay, I got it, yeah.
- All the shit that most men fantasize about.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.015
But you get April.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.077
I'm sorry, Cutler.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.518
I didn't mean to hurt you.

14:49.688 --> 14:54.921
I didn't mean to kiss on her pussy,
your fiancÃ©e.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.187
- That happened too.
- Jesus.

14:57.629 --> 15:00.928
Guess that's just the way
this fucked-up world works.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.170
Takes a big man to admit that, Kenny.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.806
Well, I've learned a lot
since I've been here.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.407
Yeah.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.374
I learned a lot since you've been here too.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.113
Okay.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.107
No hard feelings?

15:20.386 --> 15:21.614
No hard feelings.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.590
This wasn't anything.
It was just chloroform to knock you out.

15:27.026 --> 15:30.052
- I'm gonna look for you on TV.
- You better take a shower, dude.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.526
Yeah.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.858
Clean that ass.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.332
Motherfucker.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.842
Kenny?

15:48.013 --> 15:49.947
Kenny Powers?

15:50.115 --> 15:53.084
You and me at Mons Venus, baby.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.776
Guess what.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.580
I'm all packed and ready to go.

15:56.755 --> 16:00.088
I gave them my notice yesterday,
and they said, "We want two weeks. "

16:00.259 --> 16:04.958
And then I said, "Why don't you fuck off?"
Just like you, man. Just like you, man.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.997
Yeah. Yeah, nothing can stop me
from leaving Kenny.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.634
Nothing.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.826
Yeah.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.267
We need to talk, Stevie.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.538
You're not gonna be coming
with me to Tampa.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.409
No- What? But you-

16:20.579 --> 16:22.945
- No, you said-
- When I saw how excited you were...

16:23.115 --> 16:27.449
...to be coming with me,
well, I couldn't crush your feelings.

16:27.619 --> 16:32.283
So rather than do that, I decided
to give you the best week of your life.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.052
I wanted you to think
you were coming with me.

16:35.227 --> 16:37.388
Consider it my final gift to you.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.725
I don't get it.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.999
What did I do?

16:44.203 --> 16:47.104
What-? What did I do?

16:48.707 --> 16:52.609
When you started this job, you were
just an assistant, but you've graduated.

16:52.778 --> 16:56.544
You know, Stevie, when I first met you,
I'll be honest with you...

16:56.715 --> 16:58.239
...you were a little bitch.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.682
I know I was. I know. I'm sorry.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.553
But now I'm looking at you, and to me
you seem like a dude who knows what's up.

17:06.724 --> 17:10.354
You don't take shit from anybody,
you smoke weed on the reg.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.521
Quite frankly,
you're somebody I'm proud to know.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.632
And you're somebody who deserves
a whole hell of a lot more...

17:16.801 --> 17:18.394
...than just being an assistant.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.329
Is it-?

17:21.573 --> 17:23.803
Is it my last day as your assistant?

17:23.976 --> 17:26.672
This is your last day.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.947
But I have one final assignment for you.

17:30.449 --> 17:31.939
What is it?

17:32.117 --> 17:35.211
This assignment comes with a stipulation.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.912
I don't want you to perform this task
as my assistant.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.891
I'd like you to perform it as my friend.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.625
Okay.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.161
Name it.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.507
What's going on, huh?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.912
Quietly, people.
Quickly and quietly, people.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.348
Come on, this is not social time. Let's go.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.148
Is this a single-file line? Single file.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.847
Let's go. Single file.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.316
Tell me what's going on.

18:48.927 --> 18:53.455
Stop at the curb, everyone.
Do not go past the yellow curb.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.123
Okay?
Come on.

18:56.301 --> 19:00.294
Students and faculty
of Jefferson Davis Middle School...

19:01.139 --> 19:05.803
...I am here today
to give you my final farewell.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.141
- Excuse me, please. What is this?
- The rumors are true.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.045
I've been called back up to the bigs,
and I'm moving to Tampa.

19:13.218 --> 19:17.154
And just to clear up any inconsistencies...

19:17.322 --> 19:21.281
...no, April Buchanon
will not be accompanying me.

19:21.460 --> 19:26.420
She has instead chosen
to stay here with her fiancÃ©...

19:26.598 --> 19:31.058
...a wonderful man, by the way,
by the name of Principal Cutler.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.796
I'd love to run through
this without the student body...

19:33.972 --> 19:38.932
...but actually, no, we've decided to call off
our engagement for the time being.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.838
- Really? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

19:42.014 --> 19:47.179
We're just gonna take a little time
and figure some things out, so...

19:47.352 --> 19:49.752
Okay, was not really expecting that.

19:49.921 --> 19:53.254
There's a whole bunch of emotions
and kind of questions... Okay.

19:53.425 --> 19:56.485
Doesn't matter. That's not why I'm here.

19:56.662 --> 20:00.530
Today I'm here for you,
Jefferson Davis Middle.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.260
Being a man of my stature,
walking in here on day one...

20:04.436 --> 20:10.397
...was the lowest point of my life,
but now I realize that God had a purpose.

20:10.575 --> 20:14.841
God wanted to show me hell
so that when I got back to heaven...

20:15.013 --> 20:17.038
...I would finally appreciate it.

20:17.215 --> 20:22.278
And for that, I'd like to thank
each and every one of you.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.651
Because without that knowledge,
without that lesson...

20:25.824 --> 20:29.225
...I never would've been able to...

20:32.631 --> 20:36.328
What the fuck, man?
I'm trying to give a memorable speech here.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.495
All right, so- Shit.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.071
Got a limited range on my Bluetooth here.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.333
You can't see me, but you can feel me.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.841
I am still here for you.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.912
Remember me, Jefferson Davis Middle.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.784
I was your savior.
I was your knight in shining armor.

20:53.952 --> 20:58.082
In each of you,
were the chinks upon my armor.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.124
Each of you were the chinks.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.887
You all were the chinks.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.089
Remember me, my chinks.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.268
Remember me.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.771
- Remember me.
- Okay, everybody, let's go.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.938
Back to our Period 5 classes. Yes.

21:24.116 --> 21:28.849
We'd love to stay in the parking lot all day
listening to crazy speeches, but we can't.

21:29.187 --> 21:30.620
Well, here we go.

21:31.456 --> 21:35.119
Little baby Rose, I'm sorry we didn't
get much of a chance to hang out.

21:35.727 --> 21:39.629
To be honest with you,
sometimes I even forgot you even existed.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.865
I'm proud of you, Kenny. I am.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.731
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.998
- Got a good family here.
- Thanks. I love you.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.402
I love you too.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.043
Cassie, you fine piece of church ass.

21:53.211 --> 21:54.473
Oh, you're the glue.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.474
- Keep the family together, okay?
- Okay, I will.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.614
All right, you stoic little bastard.

22:00.552 --> 22:02.315
In the computer room.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.717
Little second drawer
where I keep my weed.

22:04.890 --> 22:09.486
Underneath the gun, there's a stack of porn
that'll put calluses on those hands of yours.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.060
Thanks, Uncle Kenny.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.390
Come here. Bring it in.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.991
Okay. Big dog.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.830
Why you crying, man?

22:19.004 --> 22:22.997
It's okay to be upset, but when I leave here,
I want you to do me a favor.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.474
I want you to hold your head high
and be a man, all right?

22:26.645 --> 22:29.876
I know that deep inside of you
there's a humongous set of testicles...

22:30.048 --> 22:31.675
...just waiting to pop out.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.841
- Let them pop, bro.
- Thanks.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.919
- Okay.
- I love you.

22:36.087 --> 22:37.179
- I do.
- All right.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.550
Okay. Probably good
on the hug, though. That's-

22:39.724 --> 22:42.386
Stevie, what are you doing, man?
You're over here bawling.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.758
- I'm so sorry.
- Come here. You don't have to be sorry.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.422
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too, man.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.798
Don't forget all the good times, man,
all the shit we fucked up, all right?

22:52.971 --> 22:54.563
Kenny.

22:56.641 --> 22:58.302
Bye.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.016
What are you doing here?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.656
I'm coming with you.

23:14.826 --> 23:18.057
What about your life here
and all that shit?

23:20.265 --> 23:21.562
I love you.

23:35.647 --> 23:38.207
- Uncle Kenny?
- I'm in the middle of an emotional moment.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.408
- Can you just back off.
- Phone's for you.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.916
Take a message, man.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.920
Some guy from Tampa,
and he said it's important.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.822
I better take this.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.220
Thank you.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.520
This is Kenny Powers.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.496
Kenny, Pat Anderson.

23:54.165 --> 23:55.894
Look, man, I...

23:56.067 --> 23:57.967
Well, I got some bad news, buddy.

23:58.136 --> 24:03.699
I may have not actually been supposed
to tell you that I could get you on the team.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.641
I'm sorry, man. I was just trying
to climb the ladder over here...

24:07.812 --> 24:10.508
...and anyway,
bottom line is the deal's off.

24:10.682 --> 24:13.845
So... Well, there never really was a deal.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.351
I don't know, I think I'm fired. We'll see.

24:16.521 --> 24:20.252
But I just got- You know, I got really
into the whole party scene over here.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.121
Kind of hit the dudes a little bit.
It was super weird.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.753
And you know, things are just really
fucked up for me personally right now.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.662
And I'm gonna-
I think I'm gonna probably do rehab.

24:29.834 --> 24:33.964
I don't know, we'll see what happens,
but anyway, best of luck to you.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.572
Okay?

24:35.740 --> 24:40.439
And catch you on the rebound, huh?
Later, Kenny.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.406
Perfect. That sounds terrific.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.914
I'm looking forward to it too.

24:46.084 --> 24:48.985
Okay. Thank you.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.320
Everything okay?

24:56.061 --> 24:57.551
Everything's awesome.

24:57.729 --> 25:02.598
They just wanna know
if I still wanna play under number 55.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.796
Kenny Powers, 55.

25:07.472 --> 25:10.407
You guys better get rolling, man.
You're burning daylight here.

25:10.575 --> 25:14.705
- Gonna get dark soon.
- Yeah, it is gonna get dark, isn't it?

25:15.614 --> 25:18.549
Let's hit the road.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.446
Okay.

25:22.554 --> 25:25.717
- We're gonna miss you, Kenny.
- I'm gonna miss you guys too.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.585
Get this.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.660
- You keep an eye on him for us, April.
- I will, Dustin.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.724
All right.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.396
- Yup.
- Look at that.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.659
He got it. He got it back.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.862
Still got it.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.404
- All right.
- Bye, honey.

25:42.574 --> 25:43.973
Now, you do us proud, Kenny.

25:44.142 --> 25:48.340
Kind of wish I could just stay and start
this whole thing over all over again.

25:48.513 --> 25:51.175
- Yeah, right.
- It's gonna be dark, you better get going.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.873
Yeah, man.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.541
Okay.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.051

25:57.222 --> 25:59.213
- Bye, Uncle Kenny.
- Bye, Uncle Kenny.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.189
Mow them down, Kenny.
Mow them down.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.412
This is so exciting.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.449
I can't believe we're really doing this.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.248
I'm nervous, but it's like a good nervous.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.085
Tampa is gonna be crazy, Kenny.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.523
Oh, yeah. It's gonna be pretty wild.

- Tampa, bitches.
- Tampa, bitches.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.908
Do you want anything?

26:53.344 --> 26:57.872
- I'm okay. Maybe some Skittles.
- All right.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.381
- Be right back.
- Okay.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.349
See you.

27:27.178 --> 27:28.577
