02:28.849 --> 02:32.348
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

02:32.478 --> 02:35.395
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.229
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

02:38.358 --> 02:40.647
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

02:40.777 --> 02:41.940
Stand by.

02:43.447 --> 02:45.320
You are clear to proceed.

02:45.449 --> 02:47.738
We're starting our approach.

03:14.686 --> 03:17.852
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

03:17.981 --> 03:19.060
Sir.

03:55.934 --> 03:58.935
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

03:59.062 --> 04:01.351
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.973
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

04:04.109 --> 04:07.145
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

04:07.278 --> 04:10.694
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.987
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

04:15.787 --> 04:21.077
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

04:21.209 --> 04:24.412
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

04:24.545 --> 04:27.665
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

04:28.925 --> 04:32.425
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

04:32.554 --> 04:37.298
<i>and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.</i>

04:38.100 --> 04:39.892
We shall double our efforts.

04:40.019 --> 04:43.305
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

04:43.439 --> 04:47.307
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

05:05.252 --> 05:07.707
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

05:07.838 --> 05:11.622
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

05:14.053 --> 05:16.045
Don't be so sure.

05:16.180 --> 05:19.465
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

05:19.599 --> 05:21.473
<i>you'd probably short-circuit.</i>

05:33.989 --> 05:36.028
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

05:41.162 --> 05:43.285
I'd better knock, I suppose.

05:45.125 --> 05:49.038
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

05:52.632 --> 05:54.541
Goodness gracious me!

06:17.865 --> 06:20.190
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

06:22.035 --> 06:23.945
We'd better go.

06:33.005 --> 06:34.629
R2, wait.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.507
Oh, dear. R2.

06:38.635 --> 06:41.921
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

06:42.973 --> 06:45.013
Oh, R2!

06:45.142 --> 06:46.720
R2, wait for me!

06:53.900 --> 06:57.435
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

06:57.571 --> 06:59.528
Oh, my!

07:03.492 --> 07:04.607
Oh, no.

07:09.707 --> 07:11.166
Oh, my.

07:16.172 --> 07:19.007
We bring a message
to your master,Jabba the Hutt.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.926
And a gift.

07:25.056 --> 07:26.384
What gift?

07:42.907 --> 07:48.113
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

07:58.005 --> 08:01.706
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

08:04.135 --> 08:07.551
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

08:42.381 --> 08:44.208
Good morning.

08:49.513 --> 08:51.720
The message, R2.
The message.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.441
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

09:03.568 --> 09:05.857
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

09:05.988 --> 09:09.855
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

09:10.659 --> 09:13.329
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

09:13.454 --> 09:17.118
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

09:17.248 --> 09:21.033
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

09:24.840 --> 09:27.461
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

09:27.593 --> 09:29.301
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

09:29.428 --> 09:32.096
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

09:34.140 --> 09:37.390
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift-</i>

09:37.519 --> 09:39.262
<i>these two droids.</i>

09:39.396 --> 09:41.269
What did he say?

09:41.398 --> 09:44.933
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

09:45.068 --> 09:48.816
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

09:55.411 --> 09:57.203
He's no Jedi.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.664
There will be no bargain.

10:03.794 --> 10:06.001
We're doomed.

10:06.130 --> 10:13.093
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

10:14.597 --> 10:18.012
I like Captain Solo where he is.

10:19.726 --> 10:21.803
R2, look. Captain Solo.

10:21.937 --> 10:24.475
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

10:37.619 --> 10:40.075
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

10:41.123 --> 10:45.073
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

10:46.127 --> 10:47.752
How horrid!

11:16.449 --> 11:18.987
Good. New acquisitions.

11:19.118 --> 11:21.739
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

11:21.871 --> 11:23.780
I am C-3PO-

11:23.915 --> 11:25.658
Yes or no will do.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.286
Well, yes.

11:27.418 --> 11:29.908
How many languages do you speak?

11:30.045 --> 11:33.663
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily-

11:33.799 --> 11:36.421
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

11:36.552 --> 11:39.886
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

11:40.014 --> 11:41.805
and disintegrated him.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.510
Disintegrated?

11:48.480 --> 11:52.229
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

11:52.359 --> 11:54.518
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

11:54.653 --> 11:57.987
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

11:58.115 --> 12:00.570
R2, don't leave me!

12:05.789 --> 12:07.865
You're a feisty little one...

12:07.999 --> 12:10.455
but you'll soon learn some respect.

12:10.586 --> 12:13.871
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

12:14.005 --> 12:16.710
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

12:45.327 --> 12:48.696
Ah! Do that again!

14:42.067 --> 14:46.278
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

14:47.322 --> 14:48.650
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

14:52.327 --> 14:56.953
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

15:02.754 --> 15:05.541
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

15:06.716 --> 15:07.997
Yes?

15:17.268 --> 15:19.225
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

15:19.353 --> 15:21.927
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

15:22.982 --> 15:25.022
I want 50,000. No less.

15:25.819 --> 15:27.810
"50,000. No less. "

15:40.875 --> 15:42.452
What did I say?

15:48.841 --> 15:51.462
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.755
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

16:09.111 --> 16:13.606
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

16:14.574 --> 16:17.361
fearless and inventive.

16:26.794 --> 16:29.629
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

16:29.755 --> 16:31.914
and I do suggest you take it.

16:37.472 --> 16:39.096
He agrees!

19:29.265 --> 19:31.672
Just relax for a moment.

19:31.809 --> 19:34.430
You're free of the carbonite.

19:36.522 --> 19:39.973
You have hibernation sickness.

19:40.108 --> 19:44.569
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

19:44.696 --> 19:47.982
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.911
Who are you?

19:57.918 --> 20:00.373
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

20:03.966 --> 20:05.875
I gotta get you out of here.

20:08.594 --> 20:10.338
What's that?

20:13.099 --> 20:14.973
I know that laugh.

20:20.941 --> 20:22.221
Hey,Jabba.

20:22.359 --> 20:25.193
Look,Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

20:25.319 --> 20:28.190
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

20:28.322 --> 20:32.023
It's too late for that, Solo.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.869
You may have been a good smuggler...

20:36.998 --> 20:40.449
but now you're Bantha fodder.

20:45.131 --> 20:46.080
Look-

20:47.383 --> 20:49.423
Take him away.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.296
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

20:51.429 --> 20:53.919
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.009
Bring her to me.

21:03.065 --> 21:05.105
We have powerful friends.

21:05.234 --> 21:07.475
You're gonna regret this.

21:09.362 --> 21:11.236
I'm sure.

21:15.285 --> 21:17.112
I can't bear to watch.

21:31.718 --> 21:33.177
Chewie?

21:34.972 --> 21:36.928
Chewie, is that you?

21:38.891 --> 21:41.465
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.471
What's going on?

21:47.025 --> 21:48.603
Luke? Luke's crazy.

21:48.735 --> 21:52.269
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

21:54.156 --> 21:56.030
AJedi knight?

21:56.909 --> 22:00.693
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.041
I'm all right, pal.

22:07.836 --> 22:09.461
I'm all right.

23:03.350 --> 23:05.426
I must speak with Jabba.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.599
No bargain.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.189
You will take me to Jabba now.

23:19.657 --> 23:21.448
You serve your master well.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.320
And you will be rewarded.

23:34.213 --> 23:37.463
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

23:37.591 --> 23:39.002
Master.

23:41.095 --> 23:44.179
Luke Skywalker,Jedi knight.

23:44.306 --> 23:48.553
I told you not to admit him.

23:48.686 --> 23:50.476
I must be allowed to speak.

23:50.604 --> 23:53.355
He must be allowed to speak.

23:54.191 --> 23:57.145
You weak-minded fool!

23:59.196 --> 24:03.525
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

24:03.659 --> 24:07.109
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

24:13.084 --> 24:18.245
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

24:18.382 --> 24:20.539
Nevertheless...

24:20.675 --> 24:23.629
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

24:23.761 --> 24:27.593
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

24:27.724 --> 24:30.678
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

24:32.937 --> 24:35.013
Master Luke, you're standing on-

24:35.147 --> 24:39.726
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

24:40.945 --> 24:44.480
I shall enjoy watching you die.

25:15.562 --> 25:18.136
Oh, no! The rancor!

28:05.478 --> 28:09.144
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

28:09.274 --> 28:13.486
They will all suffer for this outrage.

28:28.376 --> 28:29.372
Han.

28:32.922 --> 28:36.125
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

28:36.258 --> 28:38.666
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

28:38.803 --> 28:41.472
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

28:41.597 --> 28:44.089
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.187
Oh, dear.

28:50.064 --> 28:53.148
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

28:53.275 --> 28:56.312
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

28:56.445 --> 28:58.070
Good. I hate long waits.

29:00.491 --> 29:03.064
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

29:03.201 --> 29:05.527
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

29:05.662 --> 29:07.951
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.280
Doesn't sound so bad.

29:09.416 --> 29:13.284
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

29:13.420 --> 29:16.504
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

29:18.008 --> 29:20.131
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.884
You should have bargained,Jabba.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.180
<i>That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.</i>

30:19.735 --> 30:21.443
I think my eyes are getting better.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.690
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.741
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.704
<i>You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.</i>

30:31.830 --> 30:34.119
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.574
I've taken care of everything.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.741
Great.

30:42.883 --> 30:49.217
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.421
I'm terribly sorry.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.476
R2, what are you doing here?

30:55.604 --> 30:58.640
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.727
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.521
I wish I had your confidence.

31:29.845 --> 31:32.051
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

31:32.181 --> 31:35.301
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.759
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

31:39.897 --> 31:43.895
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

31:48.113 --> 31:53.452
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

31:53.577 --> 31:56.199
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

31:56.330 --> 31:58.121
Right?

32:01.418 --> 32:03.494
This is your last chance.

32:03.628 --> 32:05.704
Free us or die.

32:10.177 --> 32:12.964
Move him into position.

32:37.161 --> 32:39.403
Put him in.

33:03.854 --> 33:05.313
Easy, Chewie.

33:15.282 --> 33:16.740
Help!

33:23.498 --> 33:25.705
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

33:31.798 --> 33:33.257
Han, Chewie!

33:33.383 --> 33:34.414
Lando.

33:42.601 --> 33:43.845
Boba Fett?

33:45.895 --> 33:47.306
Boba Fett? Where?

34:20.512 --> 34:22.505
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

34:22.639 --> 34:24.014
I'm trying!

34:46.161 --> 34:48.570
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

35:01.302 --> 35:03.544
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

35:12.938 --> 35:14.267
Gently, now.

35:14.398 --> 35:16.438
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

35:28.203 --> 35:29.746
Chewie, give me the gun.

35:29.872 --> 35:32.873
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

35:33.000 --> 35:34.993
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

35:35.127 --> 35:36.669
A little higher!

35:39.840 --> 35:41.832
Chewie, pull us up.

35:42.968 --> 35:44.510
Up, Chewie. Up.

35:46.346 --> 35:47.924
We gotta get out of here.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.432
Not my eyes! R2, help!

35:51.560 --> 35:52.474
Quickly, R2!

35:54.021 --> 35:55.052
Beast!

36:00.443 --> 36:02.270
Get the gun!

36:02.404 --> 36:03.649
Point it at the deck.

36:09.203 --> 36:10.745
Point it at the deck!

36:14.540 --> 36:17.079
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly-

36:22.299 --> 36:23.757
Come on.

36:31.808 --> 36:34.263
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

37:13.807 --> 37:15.550
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

37:15.684 --> 37:18.305
<i>Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.</i>

37:18.437 --> 37:21.106
<i>- I will.
- Luke, thanks.</i>

37:21.231 --> 37:24.482
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

37:30.198 --> 37:32.606
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

37:39.041 --> 37:41.282
I have a promise to keep...

37:41.417 --> 37:43.374
to an old friend.

38:34.553 --> 38:36.012
Rise, my friend.

38:42.727 --> 38:45.978
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

38:46.773 --> 38:49.264
You've done well, Lord Vader.

38:49.401 --> 38:55.236
<i>Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.</i>

38:57.700 --> 38:59.111
Yes, my master.

38:59.911 --> 39:02.532
Patience, my friend.

39:02.664 --> 39:05.997
In time, he will seek you out.

39:06.126 --> 39:10.538
<i>When he does,
you must bring him before me.</i>

39:10.671 --> 39:12.960
He has grown strong.

39:13.090 --> 39:18.761
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

39:18.888 --> 39:20.632
As you wish.

39:22.267 --> 39:26.264
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

39:52.713 --> 39:54.539
That face you make-

39:55.632 --> 39:58.170
Look I so old to young eyes?

39:58.301 --> 40:00.045
No, of course not.

40:01.471 --> 40:03.096
I do.

40:06.226 --> 40:08.183
Yes, I do.

40:10.355 --> 40:12.846
Sick have I become.

40:12.982 --> 40:14.940
Old and weak.

40:19.614 --> 40:21.524
When 900 years old you reach...

40:21.658 --> 40:23.484
look as good you will not.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.498
Soon will I rest.

40:32.627 --> 40:35.747
Yes. Forever sleep.

40:37.382 --> 40:39.006
Earned it I have.

40:39.133 --> 40:41.802
Master Yoda, you can't die.

40:43.387 --> 40:46.057
Strong am I with the Force...

40:46.182 --> 40:48.139
but not that strong.

40:50.853 --> 40:55.977
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

40:59.945 --> 41:01.570
That is the way of things...

41:03.783 --> 41:05.906
the way of the Force.

41:07.827 --> 41:09.701
But I need your help.

41:09.830 --> 41:12.996
I've come back
to complete the training.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.248
No more training do you require.

41:15.377 --> 41:18.497
Already know you
that which you need.

41:21.634 --> 41:23.874
Then I am a Jedi.

41:30.809 --> 41:32.469
Not yet.

41:32.602 --> 41:34.595
One thing remains-

41:35.647 --> 41:40.059
Vader. You must confront Vader.

41:40.860 --> 41:44.988
Then- only then-
a Jedi will you be.

41:46.741 --> 41:48.864
And confront him you will.

41:53.539 --> 41:54.998
Master Yoda...

41:58.753 --> 42:01.160
is Darth Vader my father?

42:04.300 --> 42:06.790
Rest I need.

42:06.927 --> 42:08.338
Yes.

42:08.470 --> 42:10.095
Rest.

42:11.932 --> 42:13.972
Yoda, I must know.

42:18.314 --> 42:20.472
Your father he is.

42:26.780 --> 42:29.318
Told you, did he?

42:31.076 --> 42:32.452
Yes.

42:34.288 --> 42:36.576
Unexpected this is.

42:38.583 --> 42:39.994
And unfortunate.

42:41.795 --> 42:43.834
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

42:43.964 --> 42:45.244
No.

42:48.468 --> 42:52.382
<i>Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...</i>

42:52.513 --> 42:55.051
that incomplete
was your training...

42:56.142 --> 42:59.642
that not ready
for the burden were you.

43:01.648 --> 43:03.273
I'm sorry.

43:04.484 --> 43:09.988
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

43:15.036 --> 43:16.779
But beware.

43:16.913 --> 43:20.447
Anger, fear, aggression...

43:20.582 --> 43:23.204
the dark side are they.

43:23.961 --> 43:27.662
Once you start down the dark path...

43:27.798 --> 43:31.547
forever will it dominate your destiny.

43:38.809 --> 43:40.552
Do not-

43:43.647 --> 43:48.144
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

43:49.236 --> 43:52.687
or suffer your father's fate you will.

43:57.160 --> 43:59.200
When gone am I...

44:00.080 --> 44:03.165
the last of the Jedi will you be.

44:07.670 --> 44:11.751
The Force runs strong in your family.

44:14.261 --> 44:17.843
Pass on what you have learned.

44:27.690 --> 44:29.482
There is...

44:30.652 --> 44:32.312
another...

44:36.490 --> 44:40.820
Skywalker.

45:41.638 --> 45:43.512
I can't do it, R2.

45:47.394 --> 45:49.800
I can't go on alone.

45:49.937 --> 45:52.096
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

45:53.190 --> 45:54.389
Obi-Wan.

46:02.450 --> 46:04.074
Why didn't you tell me?

46:04.201 --> 46:08.069
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

46:08.205 --> 46:13.710
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

46:13.836 --> 46:17.751
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

46:17.882 --> 46:19.375
When that happened...

46:19.508 --> 46:22.675
<i>the good man who was
your father was destroyed.</i>

46:23.720 --> 46:26.128
So what I told you was true...

46:26.265 --> 46:28.092
from a certain point of view.

46:28.225 --> 46:30.681
A certain point of view?

46:30.811 --> 46:34.678
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

46:34.814 --> 46:37.732
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

46:38.527 --> 46:41.231
Anakin was a good friend.

46:42.197 --> 46:43.775
When I first knew him...

46:43.907 --> 46:46.066
<i>your father was already a great pilot...</i>

46:46.201 --> 46:49.819
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

46:49.954 --> 46:53.904
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

46:54.042 --> 46:57.956
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

46:58.088 --> 46:59.368
I was wrong.

47:00.340 --> 47:02.214
There is still good in him.

47:02.342 --> 47:05.093
He's more machine now than man...

47:05.219 --> 47:07.176
twisted and evil.

47:08.931 --> 47:11.138
I can't do it, Ben.

47:11.267 --> 47:13.176
You cannot escape your destiny.

47:13.311 --> 47:16.561
You must face Darth Vader again.

47:16.689 --> 47:19.476
I can't kill my own father.

47:22.736 --> 47:25.821
Then the emperor has already won.

47:26.866 --> 47:29.108
You were our only hope.

47:30.411 --> 47:32.533
Yoda spoke of another.

47:34.581 --> 47:37.155
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

47:38.085 --> 47:40.042
But I have no sister.

47:41.171 --> 47:43.081
To protect you both
from the emperor...

47:43.215 --> 47:46.798
<i>you were hidden from your father
when you were born.</i>

47:46.927 --> 47:49.382
The emperor knew, as I did...

47:49.513 --> 47:53.213
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

47:53.350 --> 47:55.888
they would be a threat to him.

47:56.019 --> 48:01.310
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

48:03.860 --> 48:07.810
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

48:09.115 --> 48:11.986
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

48:12.119 --> 48:14.491
They do you credit...

48:14.621 --> 48:17.705
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

48:40.188 --> 48:42.857
Look at you. A general, huh?

48:42.982 --> 48:46.067
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

48:46.194 --> 48:49.064
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

48:49.196 --> 48:52.150
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

48:52.283 --> 48:54.406
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

48:55.286 --> 48:57.243
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

48:57.371 --> 48:59.163
You're the respectable one, remember?

49:07.506 --> 49:10.460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

49:11.260 --> 49:15.127
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

49:15.264 --> 49:17.386
of the emperor's new battle station.

49:17.515 --> 49:19.307
We also know
that the weapon systems...

49:19.434 --> 49:21.676
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

49:21.811 --> 49:24.766
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

49:24.898 --> 49:26.392
in a vain effort to engage us...

49:26.525 --> 49:28.399
it is relatively unprotected.

49:28.527 --> 49:30.566
But most important of all...

49:31.487 --> 49:33.397
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

49:33.531 --> 49:35.654
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

49:35.783 --> 49:38.239
of the construction
of this Death Star.

49:39.120 --> 49:43.581
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

49:46.127 --> 49:47.455
Admiral Ackbar, please.

49:47.586 --> 49:52.712
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

49:52.842 --> 49:58.299
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

49:58.431 --> 50:01.930
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

50:03.227 --> 50:05.516
It is protected by an energy shield...

50:05.646 --> 50:09.264
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

50:14.906 --> 50:18.653
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

50:20.077 --> 50:23.991
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

50:24.123 --> 50:27.040
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

50:27.168 --> 50:30.121
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

50:33.006 --> 50:36.007
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.415
Good luck.

50:39.054 --> 50:41.011
You're gonna need it.

50:41.139 --> 50:42.848
General Madine.

50:43.892 --> 50:46.809
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

50:46.936 --> 50:51.148
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

50:51.274 --> 50:56.067
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

50:56.196 --> 50:57.441
Sounds dangerous.

50:57.572 --> 50:59.860
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

50:59.991 --> 51:02.992
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

51:03.786 --> 51:07.036
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

51:08.207 --> 51:10.284
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

51:12.754 --> 51:16.703
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

51:16.841 --> 51:18.750
I'm with you too.

51:24.640 --> 51:27.392
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

51:28.436 --> 51:31.140
Hi, Han, Chewie.

51:32.272 --> 51:34.728
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

51:50.332 --> 51:53.368
Look, I want you to take her.

51:53.502 --> 51:55.044
I mean it. Take her.

51:55.170 --> 51:58.586
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

51:58.716 --> 52:01.040
All right, old buddy.

52:01.176 --> 52:03.168
I know what she means to you.

52:03.303 --> 52:07.004
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

52:08.308 --> 52:09.719
All right?

52:09.851 --> 52:11.132
Right.

52:18.026 --> 52:20.599
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

52:20.737 --> 52:22.895
Would you get going, you pirate?

52:24.657 --> 52:25.820
Good luck.

52:25.951 --> 52:27.445
You too.

52:36.586 --> 52:38.543
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

52:41.215 --> 52:44.833
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

52:55.146 --> 52:57.103
Hey, you awake?

52:57.231 --> 53:00.682
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

53:02.819 --> 53:05.192
Come on, General. Let's move.

53:05.322 --> 53:08.656
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

53:08.784 --> 53:10.990
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

53:13.538 --> 53:15.329
Here we go again.

53:26.343 --> 53:28.251
All right, hang on.

53:44.568 --> 53:47.060
What is thy bidding, my master?

53:48.114 --> 53:51.483
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

53:54.496 --> 53:59.073
There it will stay until called for.

54:00.459 --> 54:04.504
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

54:04.630 --> 54:06.623
It is of no concern.

54:07.425 --> 54:11.672
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

54:11.804 --> 54:13.595
Your work here is finished, my friend.

54:13.722 --> 54:16.391
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

54:16.517 --> 54:18.426
Yes, my master.

54:34.159 --> 54:37.196
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

54:39.456 --> 54:42.125
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

54:43.710 --> 54:47.494
<i>Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.</i>

54:53.178 --> 54:57.222
<i>Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.</i>

54:58.641 --> 55:00.052
Transmission commencing.

55:00.184 --> 55:03.185
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

55:04.314 --> 55:06.472
It'll work. It'll work.

55:07.859 --> 55:10.017
Vader's on that ship.

55:10.153 --> 55:11.979
Don't get jittery, Luke.

55:12.112 --> 55:14.319
There are a lot of command ships.

55:15.408 --> 55:18.990
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

55:20.246 --> 55:22.702
I don't know. Fly casual.

55:27.961 --> 55:29.835
Where is that shuttle going?

55:30.714 --> 55:33.003
<i>Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?</i>

55:35.010 --> 55:37.050
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

55:39.265 --> 55:41.885
Do they have a code clearance?

55:42.684 --> 55:44.926
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

55:45.062 --> 55:47.019
I was about to clear them.

55:51.860 --> 55:54.102
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

55:54.238 --> 55:56.526
It's your imagination, kid.

55:56.656 --> 55:59.408
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

56:07.542 --> 56:09.001
Shall I hold them?

56:10.087 --> 56:12.956
No. Leave them to me.

56:13.089 --> 56:15.378
I will deal with them myself.

56:16.259 --> 56:18.465
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

56:20.347 --> 56:22.220
They're not going for it, Chewie.

56:26.435 --> 56:28.143
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

56:28.270 --> 56:30.643
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

56:30.773 --> 56:33.062
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

56:33.192 --> 56:35.683
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

56:35.820 --> 56:36.983
No problem.

57:10.395 --> 57:12.435
I told you it was dangerous here.

57:27.871 --> 57:31.322
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

57:31.458 --> 57:34.459
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

57:37.297 --> 57:39.585
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

57:39.715 --> 57:42.385
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

57:42.510 --> 57:43.885
Hey...

57:44.011 --> 57:45.292
it's me.

58:10.913 --> 58:12.905
Go for help! Go!

58:13.040 --> 58:14.534
Great. Come on!

58:30.098 --> 58:32.056
Over there! Two more of them.

58:33.101 --> 58:35.390
I see them. Wait. Leia!

58:39.274 --> 58:40.732
Hey, wait!

58:47.032 --> 58:49.487
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

59:01.129 --> 59:02.706
Move closer.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.634
Get alongside that one.

59:48.050 --> 59:50.173
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.843
General Solo, somebody's coming.

01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:20.313
Where's Leia?

01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:23.607
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

01:02:23.744 --> 01:02:26.235
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.408
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.581
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:35.458
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:39.088
And you said it was pretty here.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.739
Cut it out.

01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:22.667
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:33.396
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

01:03:35.397 --> 01:03:37.686
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:40.691
Maybe you can help me.

01:03:41.945 --> 01:03:43.653
Come on. Sit down.

01:03:45.699 --> 01:03:47.739
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:51.985
All right.
You want something to eat?

01:03:58.754 --> 01:04:00.212
That's right.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:06.842
Come on.

01:04:27.073 --> 01:04:28.448
Look. It's a hat.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.532
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:39.623
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.466
What is it?

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.370
Freeze!

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.714
Come on. Get up.

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:36.925
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:42.892
What the-

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:02.529
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:47.412
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

01:06:49.128 --> 01:06:53.874
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:57.176
Yes, I know.

01:06:58.722 --> 01:07:00.928
My son is with them.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.226
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

01:07:08.689 --> 01:07:11.181
Strange that I have not.

01:07:12.777 --> 01:07:17.984
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

01:07:18.115 --> 01:07:20.867
They are clear, my master.

01:07:20.993 --> 01:07:25.240
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:28.374
He will come to me?

01:07:30.628 --> 01:07:32.952
I have foreseen it.

01:07:33.088 --> 01:07:37.133
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:41.173
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

01:07:41.972 --> 01:07:43.514
As you wish.

01:08:05.078 --> 01:08:06.489
Master Luke.

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.960
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

01:08:13.086 --> 01:08:14.995
And I found this.

01:08:16.505 --> 01:08:20.883
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:24.929
I hope she's all right.

01:08:29.894 --> 01:08:31.009
What, Chewie?

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:35.515
What, Chewie?

01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:52.532
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:55.249
Chewie, wait! Don't!

01:08:59.799 --> 01:09:01.256
Nice work.

01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:04.877
Great, Chewie.

01:09:05.011 --> 01:09:07.087
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:10.389
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

01:09:10.517 --> 01:09:12.225
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

01:09:12.353 --> 01:09:13.810
Yeah. Sure.

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:23.398
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:25.523
It's a very long drop!

01:10:08.449 --> 01:10:11.367
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

01:10:15.914 --> 01:10:17.029
Hey!

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.621
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

01:10:25.883 --> 01:10:28.338
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

01:10:30.428 --> 01:10:32.053
Oh, my head.

01:10:36.309 --> 01:10:38.101
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:11.835
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:13.381
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

01:11:13.513 --> 01:11:16.299
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms-

01:11:16.432 --> 01:11:18.056
What are you telling them?

01:11:19.268 --> 01:11:21.344
"Hello," I think.

01:11:21.479 --> 01:11:24.515
I could be mistaken-
they're using a very primitive dialect-

01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:28.184
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:36.986
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

01:11:37.119 --> 01:11:39.990
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

01:11:40.998 --> 01:11:42.373
Proper?

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.120
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

01:11:45.252 --> 01:11:46.497
Why, you-

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.214
My mistake.

01:11:57.931 --> 01:11:59.888
He's an old friend of mine.

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:28.418
Hey.

01:12:45.602 --> 01:12:48.058
I have a really bad feeling about this.

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.662
What did he say?

01:13:10.794 --> 01:13:13.119
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

01:13:13.254 --> 01:13:16.754
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:36.648
Your Royal Highness.

01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:38.521
These are my friends.

01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:45.827
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

01:14:03.637 --> 01:14:06.804
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

01:14:06.932 --> 01:14:10.847
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

01:14:10.978 --> 01:14:12.935
<i>you'll become angry
and use your magic.</i>

01:14:13.063 --> 01:14:15.435
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly-

01:14:15.566 --> 01:14:17.108
Tell them.

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:35.117
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

01:14:35.252 --> 01:14:36.829
just as I said they wouldn't.

01:14:36.962 --> 01:14:38.242
Wait.

01:14:46.888 --> 01:14:48.762
What's happening?

01:14:54.187 --> 01:14:55.895
Put me down!
Help!

01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:57.564
Somebody!

01:14:57.690 --> 01:14:59.018
Somebody help!

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.855
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

01:15:33.601 --> 01:15:34.976
Thank goodness.

01:15:47.322 --> 01:15:48.982
Thanks, 3PO.

01:15:50.242 --> 01:15:52.199
I never knew I had it in me.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:01.251
...Tatooine...

01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:05.078
Princess Leia... R2.

01:16:07.259 --> 01:16:08.718
...Darth Vader!

01:16:11.846 --> 01:16:13.589
...Death Star.

01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:18.843
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:26.315
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.776
Master Luke...

01:16:37.455 --> 01:16:41.072
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:44.832
...Vader!

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.125
Han Solo...

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.759
...carbon.

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:53.590
...Sarlacc.

01:17:15.242 --> 01:17:18.077
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:34.511
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

01:17:35.929 --> 01:17:37.803
Just what I always wanted.

01:17:49.609 --> 01:17:51.898
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

01:17:57.533 --> 01:18:00.736
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:02.827
Good. How far is it?

01:18:02.955 --> 01:18:04.580
Ask him.

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:07.915
We need some fresh supplies too.

01:18:08.044 --> 01:18:09.952
Try and get our weapons back.

01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:13.670
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

01:18:16.176 --> 01:18:18.050
Luke, what's wrong?

01:18:19.972 --> 01:18:23.424
<i>Leia, do you remember
your mother-</i>

01:18:23.559 --> 01:18:25.598
<i>your real mother?</i>

01:18:25.727 --> 01:18:29.227
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.265
What do you remember?

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.973
Just images really. Feelings.

01:18:34.111 --> 01:18:35.688
Tell me.

01:18:37.406 --> 01:18:40.441
She was... very beautiful.

01:18:40.575 --> 01:18:43.196
Kind... but sad.

01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:48.159
Why are you asking me this?

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.747
I have no memory of my mother.

01:18:51.795 --> 01:18:53.787
I never knew her.

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.748
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.465
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

01:19:08.103 --> 01:19:09.810
How do you know?

01:19:09.937 --> 01:19:11.846
I felt his presence.

01:19:12.898 --> 01:19:16.149
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

01:19:16.277 --> 01:19:18.151
That's why I have to go.

01:19:18.279 --> 01:19:21.731
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

01:19:22.784 --> 01:19:25.737
- I have to face him.
- Why?

01:19:30.749 --> 01:19:32.623
He's my father.

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:38.214
Your father?

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:43.506
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:46.472
<i>If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.</i>

01:19:46.598 --> 01:19:48.093
Don't talk that way.

01:19:48.225 --> 01:19:52.720
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.847
You're wrong, Leia.

01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:56.808
You have that power too.

01:19:56.941 --> 01:20:00.275
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

01:20:04.908 --> 01:20:07.150
The Force is strong in my family.

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.612
My father has it.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.913
I have it.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.370
And...

01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:19.042
my sister has it.

01:20:25.344 --> 01:20:28.464
Yes. It's you, Leia.

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:35.353
I know.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:39.815
Somehow...

01:20:41.527 --> 01:20:43.105
I've always known.

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:45.194
Then you know
why I have to face him.

01:20:47.325 --> 01:20:49.732
Luke, run away.
Far away.

01:20:49.869 --> 01:20:53.202
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:56.580
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:58.666
You've always been strong.

01:20:59.962 --> 01:21:02.251
But why must you confront him?

01:21:02.381 --> 01:21:06.082
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

01:21:06.218 --> 01:21:08.210
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

01:21:08.345 --> 01:21:11.464
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:14.682
I have to try.

01:21:33.203 --> 01:21:35.112
Hey, what's going on?

01:21:36.914 --> 01:21:40.200
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

01:21:41.586 --> 01:21:43.210
Nothing?

01:21:45.006 --> 01:21:46.915
Tell me.
What's going on?

01:21:52.096 --> 01:21:54.254
I can't tell you.

01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:58.513
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:17.995
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:23.416
Hold me.

01:23:16.721 --> 01:23:18.595
This is the rebel that surrendered to us.

01:23:18.723 --> 01:23:21.640
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

01:23:21.767 --> 01:23:24.472
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

01:23:25.562 --> 01:23:28.267
He was armed only with this.

01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:31.984
Good work, Commander.

01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:34.020
Leave us.

01:23:34.155 --> 01:23:37.819
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

01:23:39.284 --> 01:23:41.028
Yes, my lord.

01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:44.994
The emperor has been expecting you.

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:47.786
I know, Father.

01:23:49.295 --> 01:23:51.619
So, you have accepted the truth.

01:23:52.797 --> 01:23:56.297
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

01:23:56.426 --> 01:23:59.629
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:03.182
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

01:24:03.976 --> 01:24:05.599
I know there is good in you.

01:24:05.727 --> 01:24:08.348
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

01:24:12.317 --> 01:24:14.523
<i>That was why
you couldn't destroy me.</i>

01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:18.108
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

01:24:25.371 --> 01:24:28.408
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

01:24:32.045 --> 01:24:34.998
Your skills are complete.

01:24:40.219 --> 01:24:44.798
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:51.513
Come with me.

01:24:53.607 --> 01:24:56.478
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

01:24:57.778 --> 01:25:02.571
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.451
I must obey my master.

01:25:06.536 --> 01:25:09.952
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.906
If that is your destiny.

01:25:14.044 --> 01:25:17.828
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

01:25:17.965 --> 01:25:20.585
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

01:25:21.843 --> 01:25:25.259
It is too late for me, son.

01:25:28.475 --> 01:25:32.804
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

01:25:32.938 --> 01:25:36.555
He is your master now.

01:25:40.612 --> 01:25:43.019
Then my father is truly dead.

01:26:26.031 --> 01:26:27.940
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

01:26:28.075 --> 01:26:30.068
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:34.570
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

01:26:34.706 --> 01:26:37.826
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

01:26:46.176 --> 01:26:47.800
What's he saying?

01:26:47.927 --> 01:26:51.261
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:13.860
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

01:27:14.746 --> 01:27:16.703
Proceed with the countdown.

01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:20.370
All groups assume attack coordinates.

01:27:23.754 --> 01:27:25.711
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.378
He'll have that shield down on time.

01:27:31.345 --> 01:27:33.836
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

01:27:35.807 --> 01:27:39.508
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

01:27:39.645 --> 01:27:41.602
All right. Stand by.

01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:03.330
Back door, huh? Good idea.

01:28:11.718 --> 01:28:14.672
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

01:28:19.851 --> 01:28:22.686
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

01:28:22.812 --> 01:28:25.303
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.931
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

01:28:29.277 --> 01:28:31.067
I'm afraid our furry companion...

01:28:31.195 --> 01:28:33.318
has gone and done something
rather rash.

01:28:38.828 --> 01:28:40.785
There goes our surprise attack.

01:28:48.086 --> 01:28:50.328
Look, over there! Stop him!

01:29:02.225 --> 01:29:05.262
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

01:29:05.395 --> 01:29:07.851
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

01:29:09.983 --> 01:29:12.190
I have decided that we shall stay here.

01:29:42.357 --> 01:29:43.352
Hey!

01:30:47.203 --> 01:30:49.990
Welcome, young Skywalker.

01:30:50.123 --> 01:30:52.448
I have been expecting you.

01:30:53.501 --> 01:30:55.459
You'll no longer need those.

01:31:00.925 --> 01:31:02.799
Guards, leave us.

01:31:10.226 --> 01:31:13.678
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

01:31:13.813 --> 01:31:18.889
In time, you will call me master.

01:31:19.026 --> 01:31:21.482
You're gravely mistaken.

01:31:21.612 --> 01:31:23.735
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

01:31:24.615 --> 01:31:28.364
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

01:31:30.495 --> 01:31:34.576
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

01:31:36.001 --> 01:31:40.129
about a great many things.

01:31:41.841 --> 01:31:43.465
His lightsabre.

01:31:43.592 --> 01:31:47.257
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

01:31:48.054 --> 01:31:50.462
Much like your father's.

01:31:50.599 --> 01:31:55.391
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

01:31:55.521 --> 01:31:58.356
So will it be with you.

01:31:58.481 --> 01:32:00.521
You're wrong.

01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:03.734
Soon I'll be dead-
and you with me.

01:32:07.198 --> 01:32:11.493
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

01:32:12.329 --> 01:32:13.739
Yes.

01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:18.996
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

01:32:20.169 --> 01:32:23.040
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

01:32:23.173 --> 01:32:26.292
Your faith in your friends is yours.

01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:32.427
It is pointless to resist, my son.

01:32:36.477 --> 01:32:41.934
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

01:32:42.066 --> 01:32:45.269
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

01:32:45.402 --> 01:32:49.732
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

01:32:51.659 --> 01:32:54.150
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

01:32:54.286 --> 01:32:57.701
to know the location
of the shield generator.

01:32:57.831 --> 01:33:01.876
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

01:33:02.002 --> 01:33:06.249
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

01:33:08.759 --> 01:33:12.507
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

01:33:12.637 --> 01:33:17.844
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

01:33:21.396 --> 01:33:22.725
All right!

01:33:22.856 --> 01:33:24.350
Up! Move!

01:33:24.483 --> 01:33:25.941
Quickly. Quickly.

01:33:30.446 --> 01:33:32.071
Han, hurry.

01:33:32.198 --> 01:33:34.072
The fleet will be here any moment.

01:33:35.785 --> 01:33:38.027
Charges. Come on. Come on!

01:33:40.165 --> 01:33:41.992
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

01:33:44.877 --> 01:33:46.585
Wait! Come back!

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.881
R2, stay with me.

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.551
Freeze!

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.888
You rebel scum.

01:34:18.577 --> 01:34:21.946
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

01:34:22.081 --> 01:34:25.247
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.249
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

01:34:31.923 --> 01:34:34.046
May the Force be with us.

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:40.639
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield- up or down.

01:34:42.308 --> 01:34:44.978
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know-

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.598
if we're coming.

01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:51.230
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

01:34:51.359 --> 01:34:53.435
I get no reading. You sure?

01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:55.728
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

01:35:00.243 --> 01:35:04.193
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.792
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

01:35:08.918 --> 01:35:10.413
It's a trap.

01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:15.963
Fighters coming in.

01:35:19.428 --> 01:35:20.757
There's too many.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.468
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

01:35:27.603 --> 01:35:28.634
Copy, Gold Leader.

01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:33.560
Come, boy.

01:35:34.443 --> 01:35:36.400
See for yourself.

01:35:39.073 --> 01:35:44.279
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:48.243
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

01:35:53.504 --> 01:35:55.828
You want this...

01:35:56.631 --> 01:35:58.505
don't you?

01:35:58.633 --> 01:36:03.129
The hate is swelling in you now.

01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:06.089
Take your Jedi weapon.

01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:07.968
Use it.

01:36:08.101 --> 01:36:10.059
I am unarmed.

01:36:10.187 --> 01:36:12.060
Strike me down with it.

01:36:12.188 --> 01:36:14.726
Give in to your anger.

01:36:15.775 --> 01:36:20.900
<i>With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.</i>

01:36:27.495 --> 01:36:29.534
It is unavoidable.

01:36:30.623 --> 01:36:32.746
It is your destiny.

01:36:33.793 --> 01:36:36.913
You, like your father...

01:36:37.046 --> 01:36:38.671
are now...

01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:41.214
mine.

01:36:59.359 --> 01:37:01.685
All right, move it.

01:37:09.702 --> 01:37:11.327
Hello. I say, over there.

01:37:12.288 --> 01:37:14.447
Were you looking for me?

01:37:15.792 --> 01:37:17.832
Bring those two down here.

01:37:25.468 --> 01:37:29.762
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

01:37:29.889 --> 01:37:31.218
Freeze.

01:37:31.349 --> 01:37:32.464
Don't move.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.510
We surrender.

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.057
The code's changed.

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:44.558
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

01:39:44.688 --> 01:39:46.681
R2, where are you?

01:39:46.815 --> 01:39:48.772
We need you at the bunker
right away.

01:39:50.861 --> 01:39:52.355
Going? What do you mean?

01:39:54.072 --> 01:39:55.696
Going where, R2?

01:39:55.824 --> 01:40:00.035
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.822
Come back!

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:29.855
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:32.900
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

01:40:36.155 --> 01:40:37.898
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.739
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:49.827
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.038
Pressure's steady.

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:08.510
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:14.858
We're in attack position, sir.

01:41:14.985 --> 01:41:18.152
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.565
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

01:41:21.699 --> 01:41:23.608
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

01:41:25.328 --> 01:41:29.408
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

01:41:29.541 --> 01:41:32.791
<i>your friends have failed.</i>

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:35.959
Now witness the firepower...

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:41.427
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

01:41:42.595 --> 01:41:45.133
Fire at will, Commander.

01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:53.854
Fire.

01:42:00.488 --> 01:42:03.026
That blast came from the Death Star.

01:42:03.991 --> 01:42:06.316
That thing's operational.

01:42:06.451 --> 01:42:08.278
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

01:42:08.412 --> 01:42:10.488
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

01:42:10.622 --> 01:42:12.829
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

01:42:12.958 --> 01:42:15.710
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

01:42:15.836 --> 01:42:19.122
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

01:42:19.256 --> 01:42:22.956
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

01:42:41.778 --> 01:42:43.189
We're coming.

01:42:49.077 --> 01:42:50.405
Come on.

01:42:54.207 --> 01:42:55.582
R2, hurry!

01:43:01.631 --> 01:43:02.580
My goodness!

01:43:08.679 --> 01:43:10.672
Why did you have to be so brave?

01:43:13.851 --> 01:43:16.389
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

01:43:16.521 --> 01:43:17.979
I'll cover you.

01:43:59.563 --> 01:44:02.018
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:04.853
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

01:44:04.984 --> 01:44:08.400
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

01:44:08.529 --> 01:44:11.151
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

01:44:11.282 --> 01:44:13.524
and we might
take a few of them with us.

01:44:16.454 --> 01:44:17.783
She's gonna blow!

01:44:21.876 --> 01:44:23.453
I'm hit!

01:44:28.633 --> 01:44:30.791
Your fleet is lost...

01:44:30.927 --> 01:44:34.971
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

01:44:37.266 --> 01:44:39.674
There is no escape...

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:42.432
my young apprentice.

01:44:44.649 --> 01:44:47.104
The Alliance will die...

01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:51.821
as will your friends.

01:44:55.451 --> 01:44:56.731
Good.

01:44:57.745 --> 01:45:00.995
I can feel your anger.

01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:06.248
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

01:45:06.378 --> 01:45:09.498
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

01:45:09.631 --> 01:45:14.127
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

01:45:53.424 --> 01:45:55.464
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:50.612
I think I got it.

01:47:50.747 --> 01:47:51.992
I got it!

01:47:59.298 --> 01:48:00.578
Are you all right?

01:48:00.716 --> 01:48:02.589
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

01:48:02.717 --> 01:48:03.997
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

01:48:04.135 --> 01:48:05.629
Don't move.

01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:12.805
- I love you.
- I know.

01:48:12.936 --> 01:48:14.264
Hands up.

01:48:15.397 --> 01:48:16.594
Stand up.

01:48:26.449 --> 01:48:27.908
Stay back.

01:48:35.833 --> 01:48:38.538
Get down here.
She's wounded.

01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:40.496
No, wait.

01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:42.207
I got an idea.

01:48:53.517 --> 01:48:55.011
Good.

01:48:55.144 --> 01:48:58.928
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:01.768
Let the hate flow through you.

01:49:07.447 --> 01:49:11.030
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

01:49:14.496 --> 01:49:16.868
I will not fight you, Father.

01:49:30.970 --> 01:49:33.757
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

01:49:58.706 --> 01:50:01.113
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:04.370
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

01:50:04.503 --> 01:50:06.959
There is no conflict.

01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:11.299
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

01:50:11.427 --> 01:50:13.384
<i>and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.</i>

01:50:13.512 --> 01:50:18.055
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

01:50:18.183 --> 01:50:20.010
If you will not fight...

01:50:20.143 --> 01:50:22.717
then you will meet your destiny.

01:50:34.199 --> 01:50:35.397
Good.

01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:36.944
Good.

01:50:45.626 --> 01:50:49.245
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

01:50:51.174 --> 01:50:52.585
Good shot, Red Two.

01:50:56.221 --> 01:50:59.304
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

01:50:59.431 --> 01:51:01.092
Don't let me down.

01:51:05.646 --> 01:51:07.105
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

01:51:07.231 --> 01:51:09.557
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.</i>

01:51:09.692 --> 01:51:12.230
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

01:51:13.321 --> 01:51:15.277
Send three squads to help.

01:51:15.406 --> 01:51:17.363
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

01:51:31.546 --> 01:51:32.957
Throw me another charge.

01:51:50.524 --> 01:51:53.311
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

01:51:54.570 --> 01:51:56.479
I will not fight you.

01:51:59.991 --> 01:52:03.027
Give yourself to the dark side.

01:52:04.621 --> 01:52:08.666
<i>It is the only way
you can save your friends.</i>

01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:11.417
Yes.

01:52:11.545 --> 01:52:13.501
Your thoughts betray you.

01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:16.167
Your feelings for them are strong...

01:52:16.299 --> 01:52:18.172
especially for...

01:52:20.345 --> 01:52:22.005
sister.

01:52:23.264 --> 01:52:27.594
So you have a twin sister.

01:52:27.727 --> 01:52:31.427
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

01:52:31.564 --> 01:52:35.644
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

01:52:35.776 --> 01:52:40.154
Now his failure is complete.

01:52:41.657 --> 01:52:45.441
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

01:52:45.577 --> 01:52:48.365
then perhaps she will.

01:52:48.497 --> 01:52:49.410
Never!

01:53:35.043 --> 01:53:36.751
Good!

01:53:41.091 --> 01:53:43.795
Your hate has made you powerful.

01:53:45.094 --> 01:53:49.970
Now, fulfil your destiny...

01:53:50.099 --> 01:53:54.179
and take your father's place at my side.

01:54:09.243 --> 01:54:10.572
Never.

01:54:13.622 --> 01:54:15.780
I'll never turn to the dark side.

01:54:18.752 --> 01:54:21.587
You've failed, Your Highness.

01:54:21.714 --> 01:54:23.671
I am a Jedi...

01:54:23.799 --> 01:54:25.839
like my father before me.

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:36.885
So be it, Jedi.

01:54:37.104 --> 01:54:38.977
Move! Move!

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:55.485
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:59.370
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.409
I told you they'd do it.

01:55:08.551 --> 01:55:11.172
If you will not be turned...

01:55:11.303 --> 01:55:14.637
<i>you will be destroyed.</i>

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.392
Young fool.

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:27.187
Only now, at the end...

01:55:27.319 --> 01:55:29.193
do you understand.

01:55:42.417 --> 01:55:48.171
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:55.842
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

01:56:01.436 --> 01:56:03.263
Father, please!

01:56:18.578 --> 01:56:20.736
Now, young Skywalker...

01:56:22.874 --> 01:56:24.701
you will die.

01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:52.394
No.

01:56:54.728 --> 01:56:57.008
No!

01:57:47.757 --> 01:57:49.215
I'm going in.

01:57:52.386 --> 01:57:53.585
Here goes nothing.

01:58:00.686 --> 01:58:04.553
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

01:58:06.775 --> 01:58:10.226
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

01:58:25.918 --> 01:58:27.911
Split up and head back to the surface.

01:58:28.046 --> 01:58:31.213
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

01:58:31.341 --> 01:58:32.290
Copy, Gold Leader.

01:58:42.602 --> 01:58:44.179
That was too close.

01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:50.349
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

01:58:50.485 --> 01:58:53.520
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star Destroyer.

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:01.783
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

01:59:01.912 --> 01:59:04.914
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

01:59:07.418 --> 01:59:09.161
Intensify forward firepower!

01:59:11.004 --> 01:59:12.202
Too late!

01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:01.167
Help me take this mask off.

02:00:01.304 --> 02:00:03.178
But you'll die.

02:00:04.057 --> 02:00:07.555
Nothing can stop that now.

02:00:08.644 --> 02:00:10.269
Just for once...

02:00:11.230 --> 02:00:12.855
let me...

02:00:12.982 --> 02:00:16.433
look on you with my own eyes.

02:00:52.687 --> 02:00:57.065
Now go, my son.

02:00:58.777 --> 02:01:00.188
Leave me.

02:01:01.279 --> 02:01:03.735
No. You're coming with me.

02:01:03.865 --> 02:01:06.191
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

02:01:07.076 --> 02:01:10.777
You already have, Luke.

02:01:11.956 --> 02:01:13.830
You were right.

02:01:14.626 --> 02:01:16.951
You were right about me.

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.672
Tell your sister...

02:01:21.715 --> 02:01:23.922
<i>you were right.</i>

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:32.096
Father.

02:01:36.438 --> 02:01:37.767
I won't leave you.

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:04.211
There it is.

02:02:07.177 --> 02:02:09.549
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

02:02:09.679 --> 02:02:12.965
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

02:02:32.202 --> 02:02:35.322
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

02:03:22.542 --> 02:03:24.202
They did it!

02:03:32.678 --> 02:03:35.085
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

02:03:36.848 --> 02:03:38.675
He wasn't.

02:03:38.808 --> 02:03:40.468
I can feel it.

02:03:45.148 --> 02:03:46.726
You love him.

02:03:50.152 --> 02:03:51.563
Don't you?

02:03:51.696 --> 02:03:53.155
Yes.

02:03:53.281 --> 02:03:55.986
All right. I understand.

02:03:56.117 --> 02:03:57.492
Fine.

02:03:58.536 --> 02:04:00.328
When he comes back...

02:04:01.414 --> 02:04:03.158
I won't get in the way.

02:04:05.876 --> 02:04:07.834
It's not like that at all.

02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:13.874
He's my brother.

02:05:55.484 --> 02:05:57.109
Wesa free!
