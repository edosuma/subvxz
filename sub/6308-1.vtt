Flashmobs?
What are you talking about?

07:35.998 --> 07:39.710
Yes. I was going to take the class

07:39.836 --> 07:41.796

07:41.921 --> 07:45.424
Mr Poppy, flashmobs have got nothing
to do with school inspections.

07:45.550 --> 07:49.720
Sorry, but you've just gone on
in the assembly hall about super teachers.

07:49.846 --> 07:52.890
You've got a super donkey here.
He can dance, he can sing.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.643
I can put a little cape on him
if it makes you feel better.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.311
What you like to tell me,
what sort of dance does he do?

07:57.436 --> 07:58.479
A highland fling?

07:58.604 --> 08:01.649

he does break-dancing.

brain how important the flashmob is.

will see us dancing

08:57.705 --> 08:58.789

08:58.915 --> 09:02.710
No one's gonna close a school down

09:04.879 --> 09:06.923

Look, I know he's a donkey, guys,

10:31.215 --> 10:33.759
There's donkey poo everywhere

10:33.884 --> 10:37.096
And there's a man called Mr Poppy
who says he's a teacher but he's not

10:37.221 --> 10:39.682
and it will be a disaster
if the inspector sees him.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.810
- Who's this?
- This is my daughter, Lauren.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.812
Oh, what's she doing?

10:44.937 --> 10:46.480
Oh, she comes to work with me,
I find it quite helpful.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.085
Ah, but you'll have to be in uniform.

10:48.149 --> 10:50.818
There's a lost property box
in my... in my study.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.987
It's a bit smelly but could you fit her up?

10:53.112 --> 10:54.947
Now, er... don't take any notice.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.159
We're in total chaos.
The children have taken over completely.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.202
No, you're not going in there,
you're coming this way.

11:00.328 --> 11:02.788
- Oh... Oh, God!
- Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.707
Come on!

11:05.750 --> 11:08.711
Hello? Yes, I'm calling you
from St Bernadette's School.

11:08.878 --> 11:12.715
There's a donkey here.
I wonder if you could come and collect it.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.841
Excuse me. What?

11:17.511 --> 11:20.973
You can't do that.
All the children love that donkey.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.517
- That's fine, they can go and visit it.
- And the donkey loves them.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.604
Yes, how lovely, but this is not
the right place for a donkey.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.612
Psst, guys.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.365
Don't worry, it's me.
Have you seen the super teacher?

11:37.490 --> 11:39.033
He's in the head's office.

11:39.158 --> 11:42.161
I've got a plan. Watch this space.

11:43.079 --> 11:47.291
Oh, Lauren, come on, you monkey!
Just because all the other children...

11:47.458 --> 11:49.210
Good afternoon... evening.

11:49.335 --> 11:52.671
I'm the government
inspector of the schools.

11:52.797 --> 11:56.092
- I need you to get Mr Poppy back.
- Mr Poppy?

11:56.217 --> 11:58.969
He's the bestest teacher
in the world of the land.

11:59.095 --> 12:00.596
Can you get him reinstated?

12:00.721 --> 12:04.225
Well, it's really a question for Mrs Keen. We
could get her in and have a chat about it.

12:04.350 --> 12:07.353
No, I don't think there's any
need for that, Mr... what is it?

12:07.478 --> 12:09.730
- Shepherd, Jeremy Shepherd.
- German Shep... What?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.732
Jeremy Shepherd.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.026
And I'm Inspector Gadgnet, Gadgneet.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.820
- Gadget?
- Yeah, that's it.

12:15.945 --> 12:18.739
I'll call the main office,
see if they can't find Mrs Keen,

12:18.864 --> 12:19.907
cos she's really the person...

12:20.032 --> 12:23.077
No, I don't think there's any need
for that, Mr Snippet.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.163
Could you tell Mrs Keen I think I've
found the man she's looking for.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.289
Ow!

12:27.415 --> 12:29.041
Thank you.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.252
- You know who I think that is.
' POPPY-

12:31.377 --> 12:33.796
Mr Poppy, yeah.
Come on, let's get you dressed.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.768
(Mr Shepherd) There's a
picture of Mr Poppy.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.803
"The donkey pooed
on Mr Poppy's foot today."

12:40.928 --> 12:45.266
This whole school seems to centre
around Mr Poppy and the stupid donkey.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.394
Right, er... children, come in.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.728
Sit down.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.860
Er... right, children, because I don't
know you and you don't know me,

12:55.985 --> 12:58.237
I'd just like to ask you a few questions.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.197
Could you sit on your seat please?
What's your name?

13:00.322 --> 13:02.241
- Joseph.
- Thank you, Joseph.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.368
- What's your name?
- Bob.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.493
Tell me what the capital of France is,
please, Bob?

13:07.288 --> 13:09.915
Er... Malumbia?

13:10.666 --> 13:13.043
Malumbia? I don't think that exists.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.379
Oh, for goodness sake.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.757
- Mr Poppy.
- I'm not Mr Poppy.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.801
I'm the new boy, Marmaduke James.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.722
Was just starting at the school,
trying to do some learning.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.183
- Just get out.
- Oh, come on, it's not fair.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.643
- I'll get Mrs Keen.
- (Grunts)

13:29.727 --> 13:32.021
Can you just please just let me...

13:33.731 --> 13:35.441
Right, children...

13:35.566 --> 13:37.610
Hey, come on... Out!

13:37.735 --> 13:39.820
(Children laugh)

13:40.404 --> 13:41.947
All right, it's not funny.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.283
Come on, back to work.
Concentrate on what you're doing.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.826
(Mobile ringing)

13:45.951 --> 13:49.330
Um... OK, children, I've got to take this
so just keep working.

13:49.455 --> 13:51.457
- Hello?
- Hello, Sophie?

13:51.582 --> 13:54.418
What's the matter?
A little bit grumpy?

13:54.543 --> 13:57.713
Right, is this urgent,
cos I'm in the middle of a class?

13:57.838 --> 14:01.467
'No, I'm just... I'm excited.
I'm a little bit nervous.'

14:01.592 --> 14:04.595
The good news is that,
by way of a present,

14:04.720 --> 14:09.767
Bradley has offered
to put on flashmob at the wedding.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.853
Bradley Finch?
He's coming to our wedding?

14:12.978 --> 14:15.356
I'm sorry, Sophie,
but is that entirely appropriate,

14:15.523 --> 14:18.567
to have your ex-boyfriend at our wedding?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.945
- Well, he's still my friend.
- 'No, thank you. No, thank you.'

14:21.070 --> 14:24.949
The last thing I need is to be taught to dance
by your ex-boyfriend. That's not happening.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.243
We've just got to go with the flow, Jeremy.

14:27.368 --> 14:30.829
And believe me, Lauren will love it.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.540
I know you've got to go,
I've got to go too.

14:32.665 --> 14:34.041
Oh, OK.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.212
- I love you.
- (Mumbles) I love you too.

14:38.337 --> 14:41.006
Huh? What did you say?
Cos it sounded like...

14:41.131 --> 14:42.132
(Mimics Mr Shepherd)

14:42.258 --> 14:43.259
I love you.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.219
- (Children giggle)
- Yes. Ssh.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.887
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:48.806 --> 14:51.392
I'll take that as "I love you too".

14:52.184 --> 14:53.686
Do you know Bradley Finch?

14:53.811 --> 14:56.397
Er... well, I've met him.
I wouldn't say I know him.

14:56.522 --> 14:57.940
Can we all get back to our work, please?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.651
We know you have a problem
but we know who can help you.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.362
(All) Yeah!

15:03.487 --> 15:06.073
- Mr Poppy, <i>I</i> Suppose?
- (All) Yes!

15:06.198 --> 15:07.558
All right, that's enough Mr Poppy.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.577
That's enough about my wedding.
Let's just concentrate...

15:09.743 --> 15:12.288
- Come on, follow us.
- Yeah, come on.

15:12.413 --> 15:13.914
No!

15:14.039 --> 15:15.624
Come on, Mr Shepherd.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.127
It'll be fun.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.714
All right, all right, come on.

15:22.798 --> 15:23.799
(Squealing)

15:23.924 --> 15:26.468
- I can't believe it.
- I know. I'm here!

15:26.594 --> 15:28.012
- In New York.
- In New York.

15:28.137 --> 15:29.346
For my...

15:29.471 --> 15:30.806
(Both) Wedding!

15:32.850 --> 15:33.726
Hello.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.311
Miss Ford, there's a bouquet for you here.

15:35.436 --> 15:38.355
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, he's so sweet.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.359
I was just on the phone to him
and he was so grumpy, but look what he did.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.320
"Dear Sophie, love and..."

15:45.571 --> 15:49.950
It's from... from Bradley.
It's not from Jeremy.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.494
- So he's here?
- No, but he's coming.

15:52.578 --> 15:55.539
- Ah... right.
- And he is going to give me a present

15:55.664 --> 15:57.416
of a flashmob.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.501
- A flashmob?
- For the wedding.

15:59.627 --> 16:04.840
(Both) It's gonna be
the best wedding ever.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.677
Come on.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.555
Ha-ha!

16:11.680 --> 16:13.349
Mr Shepherd.

16:13.474 --> 16:15.851
- We meet again.
- Yes, Mr Poppy, we do.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.312
What I need to find out, OK,
is are you're gonna help me?

16:18.437 --> 16:20.898
- Help you what?
- I've got to get back into the school

16:21.023 --> 16:23.776
because if I don't get
back there, Mr Shepherd,

16:23.901 --> 16:25.319
we're not gonna be able
to enter the competition.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.279
I don't know what you're talking about.
What competition?

16:27.404 --> 16:31.742
- The flashmob competition.
- Why is everybody talking about flashmobs?

16:31.867 --> 16:33.994
Apparently, I've now got
to have one at my wedding.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.455
- You're getting married?
- In New York.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.957
My dad's getting married
to a girl called Sophie

16:39.083 --> 16:41.001
and Sophie's got an ex-boyfriend.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.419
Bradley Finch.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.213
- Bradley Finch, the dancer?
- Yes.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.256
- Bradley Finch, the flashmob guru?
- Yes.

16:46.382 --> 16:49.301
- We love him!
- I think he's trying to get Sophie back.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.346
- Well, we don't know that, do we?
- Well, it sounds like it to me.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.557
- I don't see that's any of your business.
- We can get a flashmob troupe together,

16:55.683 --> 16:58.185
win the competition, go over to New York

16:58.310 --> 17:03.899
and stop Bradley Finch
smoochy-smooching your fiancée.

17:04.023 --> 17:08.987
Everybody meet tomorrow for flashmob
auditions in the hall taken by...

17:10.571 --> 17:12.116

We've got no time for sunbathing.

Mr Shepherd.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.158
Dad?

20:41.700 --> 20:44.286
Maybe he was climbing the tree.
He fell out of the tree.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.915
Mr Shepherd? Come on, wake up.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.458
Are you OK, Dad?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.919

21:03.472 --> 21:05.432
Hello, sleepy head.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.685
How are you?
We rescued you from outside.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.189
You'd fallen out of the tree
cos you were scrumping for apples.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.941
- Who are you?
- Dad?

21:15.359 --> 21:17.194
Who are you?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.655
- Do you want a drink of water?
- No.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.948
Cuddle?

21:22.616 --> 21:26.078
Oh, what are you talking about?

21:29.623 --> 21:31.667
- Where's this?
- (Mr Poppy) Where is this?

21:31.792 --> 21:34.461
This is the school.
You're a super teacher with super powers.

21:34.586 --> 21:38.340
Remember the flashmobs?
The flashmobs. We auditioned in the hall.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.925
You were spinning around
on the chair going,

21:40.050 --> 21:43.637
"I don't want her on my team“.
Remember that, Mr Shepherd?"

21:43.804 --> 21:47.182
Christmas. You were getting married
Christmas Eve in New York.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.434
The nativity.
You must remember the nativity?

21:49.559 --> 21:51.103
Little baby Jesus.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.438
Mason, grab baby Jesus from the crib.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.899
Remember this little guy?

21:56.024 --> 21:58.694
Hold him, it's baby Jesus.

21:58.819 --> 22:01.571
- Mrs Mean's coming.
- Quick, hide me.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.533
False alarm everybody, phew!

22:04.658 --> 22:06.660
It wasn't the inspector after all that.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.954
It was a man with a van
and he's taken the donkey away

22:09.079 --> 22:11.790
so no more donkey droppings
all over the place.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.637
Thank you so much, Mr Shepherd.
You made the phone call, didn't you?

22:14.710 --> 22:16.253
We're all fine now.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.258
No inspector today but we don't know
when he's going to be coming, do we?

22:19.297 --> 22:21.049
This is the baby Jesus.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.814
How sweet. Have you been doing
the nativity altogether? How lovely.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.013
But children, don't forget,
the inspector's on his way.

22:26.138 --> 22:27.681
See you in a minute.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.935
- What have you done with my donkey?
- What donkey?

22:32.060 --> 22:35.022
Archie, my singing and dancing donkey.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.314
I don't know.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.775
- You do know who I am, don't you?
- No.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.904
I'm the headteacher
and you are answerable to me.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.532
- So what have you done with the donkey?
- I don't know.

22:45.657 --> 22:47.909
Oh, come on.
Can't you remember anything?

22:48.785 --> 22:50.537
Look...

22:50.620 --> 22:53.790
Look into those eyes.
What do you see?

22:53.915 --> 22:56.626
- A little girl.
- Your little girl, Lauren.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.088
This is the baby Jesus.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.717
Where you going now?

23:03.842 --> 23:06.178
- Dad! Dad!
- Mr Shepherd?

23:06.303 --> 23:08.055
We just need to get him home, OK?

23:08.180 --> 23:09.598
- Do you know where you live?
- Yes.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.099
Right. We'll get him to a doctor

23:11.224 --> 23:13.101
and then he probably just needs
a good night's sleep

23:13.226 --> 23:14.895
and he'll be as right as rain.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.521
I promise I'm gonna help you.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.148
And that's a Poppy promise.

23:18.273 --> 23:21.109
Yeah, and they're 100% guaranteed, right?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.861
(All) Yeah!

23:22.944 --> 23:24.584
We're gonna get
Mr Shepherd's memory back.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.364
Come on, let's go!

23:32.579 --> 23:34.581
Lauren, you don't actually live
in one of these houses, do you?

23:34.706 --> 23:35.707
Yes, I do.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.000
- Are they real?
- Yes.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.794
- Do Smurfs live in them?
- No.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.504
- They're tiny.
- Hi, Lauren.

23:40.629 --> 23:41.963
Hi.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.423
Who's that?

23:43.548 --> 23:46.009
- The librarian.
- Bet she's got a big brain.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.345
- Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.764
- Who's Jeremy?
- You.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.060
- Hi, Katherine. Hi, Toby.
- Hi, Lauren.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.604
Hi, Jeremy.
Gosh, there's a lot of you today.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.731
Ooh, nice dog.

23:59.856 --> 24:03.443
- There's the doctor's.
- (Mr Poppy) Come on, let's go in.

24:07.197 --> 24:10.617
He fell out of a tree. I had a little look
where he fell around the apple tree

24:10.742 --> 24:12.452
and there was no brains
coming out of his ears.

24:12.577 --> 24:13.577
Well, the good news is

24:13.620 --> 24:15.622
that there doesn't seem
to be too much physical damage.

24:15.747 --> 24:20.585
I think what you're going to have to do
is try and flood his brain

24:20.710 --> 24:24.965
with... with warm memories,
with pleasant associations...

24:25.090 --> 24:28.510
Yeah, but he can't remember anything.
He can't even remember Christmas.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.095
(Doctor) He can't remember Christmas?

24:30.220 --> 24:33.932
Well, maybe what you should do
is create Christmas for him a little early.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.892
Surround him with all things Christmas.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.353
- Would scaring him work?
- Scaring him?

24:38.478 --> 24:40.647
Yeah, I mean it works when I have hiccups.

24:40.772 --> 24:43.525
- What sort of...?
- (Shouts)

24:50.198 --> 24:53.201
(Mimics fanfare)

24:57.372 --> 24:59.875
- I don't like it.
- Whoa!

25:01.585 --> 25:05.755
This is your house, Mr Shepherd.
It's where you live.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.383
- Look, Christmas tree.
- Christmas tree.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.846
- Yes! Tinsel.
- Tinsel.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.516
Yes! Look, there's a robin.
Can you say robin?

25:16.641 --> 25:17.976
- Robin.
- Robin!

25:18.101 --> 25:21.062
Robin, robin, robin, robin.
You remember, don't you?

25:21.188 --> 25:24.024
No, I don't. I don't remember.

25:24.149 --> 25:27.819
That's just it, that's the thing.
I don't remember anything.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.697
All right, keep your hair on.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.786
He can't have forgotten you, Lauren.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.789
- Mr Poppy will look after you.
- Yeah, he always does.

25:39.915 --> 25:42.334
We'll get him to remember Christmas
for you, Lauren.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.923
What you doing up here?

25:50.425 --> 25:53.011
- I don't like these clothes.
- They're your clothes.

25:53.136 --> 25:56.306
I don't like them though.
I don't know this man.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.183
OK, all right, easy.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.060
We can take you to the shops tomorrow.
Give you a little makeover.

26:00.185 --> 26:03.104
- What's a makeover?
- You know, put some new clothes on you,

26:03.230 --> 26:07.901
er... do your hair
and a bit of makeup maybe... No.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.153
Look, it doesn't matter about clothes, OK?

26:10.278 --> 26:13.573
What matters is there's a little
girl downstairs who needs your help.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.909
Come on, let's go
and find out about Christmas.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.037
Ow!

26:19.162 --> 26:20.372
Whoa!

26:21.122 --> 26:22.666
Have you got your memory back?

26:22.791 --> 26:24.542
- Ah...
- Come on, let's go.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.462
(Shouts)

26:28.880 --> 26:35.011
First we put mince pies
and carrots for the reindeer.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.472
What are...
Sorry, what are the reindeers?

26:37.597 --> 26:40.350
Reindeers are really handy
cos they pull the sleigh through the sky.

26:40.475 --> 26:44.896
- What's a sleigh?
- A sleigh is the thing that Santa rides in.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.857
Yeah, it's like a big wooden car pulled
by the reindeers through the night sky.

26:47.983 --> 26:52.237
- And who's Santa?
- Oh, Dad, this is Santa.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.072
Well, he's a bit bigger than that
and he's fatter.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.031
What?

26:55.156 --> 26:57.993
Yeah, he's got a huge white beard
and a sack of presents.

26:58.118 --> 27:01.997
He goes, "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas."

27:02.122 --> 27:04.165
How does he know
what presents to get people?

27:04.291 --> 27:08.503
You write a list
and post it to the North Pole.

27:08.628 --> 27:12.048
- Tell him about the naughty or nice list.
- You're either naughty or you're nice

27:12.215 --> 27:15.385
and I think the whole of the class
will get on the nice list

27:15.510 --> 27:19.514
and I think you would maybe
get on the bad list.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.559
- Why?
- Because you don't remember Christmas.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.853
(Mr Poppy) Yeah.
(Lauren) Christmas is magical.

27:24.978 --> 27:28.148
That's why we make Christmas wishes
in our wishing well.

27:28.273 --> 27:32.444
We put magic fairy dust in
that Mum left us.

27:32.569 --> 27:35.071
- Who's Mum?
- My mum.

27:35.196 --> 27:38.616
- Where's she?
- In heaven.

we aren't gonna save the school

41:16.142 --> 41:18.302

If you guys can prove to me
that you love Christmas

(Mimics buzzer)
You guys are not doing well at this test.

41:55.556 --> 41:59.226
If you can pass the song test,
then you can see Father Christmas.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.228
- (Mr Poppy) Bring it on.
- What about the elf, is he gonna be singing?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.272
He's not an elf, that's Mr Shepherd.

42:03.397 --> 42:05.024
He's got the hat, he's got the trousers,
he's got the ears.

42:05.149 --> 42:06.275
I mean...

42:06.400 --> 42:09.570
he has definitely got the ears for it
so he's an elf.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.906
- Why are you being so mean on him?
- I'm not being mean on him.

42:12.031 --> 42:15.201
I'm just saying that
he's come up in my elf crib

42:15.326 --> 42:18.787
and he's bringing his elf self
up in my elf grill

42:18.913 --> 42:21.916
and all I'm saying
is you'd better elf off.

42:22.041 --> 42:24.543
- Right, OK, let's go through.
- No, no, no!

42:24.668 --> 42:26.670
Please, one at a time.
Please don't crowd him.

42:26.795 --> 42:29.798
He'll be claustrophobic.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:34.136 --> 42:37.598
- I really don't like your elf.
- No, he's a bit official, isn't he?

42:37.723 --> 42:39.141
- Yes.
- He's elf-ish.

42:39.266 --> 42:41.727
- Yeah, he is elf-ish.
- Have you got a special wish?

42:41.852 --> 42:45.231
Yeah, I've got actually a
really important wish.

42:45.356 --> 42:47.316
- I lost my donkey.
- How did you lose him?

42:47.441 --> 42:48.943
I don't know.

42:49.068 --> 42:51.403
Mr Shepherd seems to have
put him somewhere

42:51.528 --> 42:53.072
and can't remember where.

42:53.197 --> 42:56.367
We'll get him back.
Anyone else got a wish?

42:56.492 --> 42:58.077
- What's your name?
- Lauren.

42:58.202 --> 43:00.454
You come and tell me, Lauren.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.081

43:05.000 --> 43:07.670
Ah, Lauren,

43:07.795 --> 43:11.507
I want Dad to marry Sophie

(Lauren) Yeah.

43:13.259 --> 43:16.679

- True that.

43:26.689 --> 43:30.150
Oh, wait a minute.
You can't make that promise.

43:30.359 --> 43:33.153
You can't say what I will
and what I won't remember.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.822
This is all made up.

43:34.947 --> 43:38.117
The wooden horses with ears,
they're not even real.

43:38.242 --> 43:40.962
- These trees, they're everywhere.

And what's that?

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.212
I'm the headmaster

01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:07.798
and I'd like to know what Bradley Finch
is doing here smooching you.

01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:11.260
- And I'd like to know what you're doing here.
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:14.472
We won a competition to do a dance
on top of the Empire State Building.

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:17.808
I'm sorry, you won a competition?

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:20.519
What is wrong with you?
Can't you afford socks?

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:23.689
- Sorry, who... he's the headmaster?
- And best man.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:27.360
Why is this man your best man?
You've only known him five minutes.

01:06:27.485 --> 01:06:30.655
- My brother, Charlie, is the best man.
- Yeah.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.616
- Can't we just all be one big happy family?
- Yeah.

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:45.461
Do you see what he's wearing?

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:47.505
Look, Nanny Pam, I've got Oreo eyes.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.007
I can't believe she's gonna marry him.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:54.637
Hello, Mr Poppy, I'm an American.
How are you today?

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:55.971
Look at him.

01:06:56.097 --> 01:06:57.848
- Your burger and your shake, Mr Poppy.
- (Gasps)

01:06:57.973 --> 01:07:01.894
Maybe he's just a bit overexcited
cos the whole wedding and...

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:04.814
- Yeah, he's definitely overexcited, I mean...
- (Slurps)

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.566
Nothing else could explain that, could it?

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:08.859
(Burps)

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:11.237
- You met him before.
- Yeah.

01:07:11.362 --> 01:07:13.572
- He's always been like this?
- No, no, no, he's, um...

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:15.574
straight, you know, straight-laced.

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:17.201
Taste that.

01:07:17.284 --> 01:07:19.578
- There's something wrong.
- It's really good.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:21.914
- I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
- (Charlie) Yeah.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.666
(Mr Poppy) She's got to marry you.

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:26.585
She doesn't even like me.
She likes Bradley Finch.

01:07:26.752 --> 01:07:27.837
(Lauren) Because you've changed.

01:07:27.962 --> 01:07:29.797
We've got to make her
like you, Mr Shepherd.

01:07:29.922 --> 01:07:33.551
You're gonna take Sophie down that aisle
if it's the last thing we make you do.

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:37.096
We're gonna sort out your wedding cake.
We'll sort the vows out.

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:38.806
We need to get you some
new clothes as well.

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:40.766
- Some new togs.
- Really?

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.309
- Threads.
- Threads?

01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:45.146
If you're gonna come to this wedding,
you need to come correct.

01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:52.111
(Phone ringing)

01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:54.989
St Bernadette's, Mrs Keen speaking.

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.783
Yes, I'd like to speak
to the headteacher, please.

01:07:57.908 --> 01:07:59.243
Mm-hm, speaking.

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:02.079
No, the headmaster, please.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:05.875
It's me, Mrs Keen.
I am the headmistress.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.626
I thought the headmaster was Mr Poppy.

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:10.796
Mr Poppy was never a headmaster.
Lord, no!

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:15.426
'He's just an unqualified classroom
assistant. Mr Poppy has gone.'

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:17.386
You are the inspector, are you?

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:21.724
Oh, my goodness, is that the time?
I've said way too much. Bye-bye.

01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:23.225
Mr POPPY-

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:24.643
Mr Poppy, please.

01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:26.020
(Knock on door)

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:28.939
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to interrupt.
- Uncle Henry.

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.817
Mr Poppy, you're gonna have
to be out of here by noon today.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:34.111
They have created a number of incidents.

01:08:34.236 --> 01:08:36.076
At breakfast there was pancakes
on the ceiling.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.656
There was a river of maple syrup.

01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:40.242
I'm afraid it's just not gonna work here.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:42.787
- Has Uncle Henry been good to you?
- (All) Yeah.

01:08:42.912 --> 01:08:46.247
- Thanks, Uncle Henry.
- (All) Bye, Uncle Henry.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:49.292
I'm not their uncle.

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:53.546
- He's just pretending to be angry.
- (All) Yeah.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:58.219
- I think you should look more cool.
- He could do with a looking a bit cooler.

01:08:58.344 --> 01:09:01.263
How much were the family
loving Bradley Finch last night?

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.057
(All) Too much.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.392
He thinks he's the groom.
You're the groom.

01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:09.854
You need to say to him, "I'm the groom!"
Or maybe you need to be Bradley Finch.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.817
- What?
- Well, then Sophie might like you more.

01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:16.779
Maybe we've got to Finch you up, big style.

01:09:16.904 --> 01:09:18.363
Maybe.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:20.866
Spick and span, Betty.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.786
- Spick and span.
- Of course, sir.

01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:24.912
Housekeeping.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.091
- Spick and span, Betty.
Spick and span.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.261
Yes, sir, sure, sir.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.889
Housekeeping.

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.515
(Finch) Come in.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.938
Yeah.

01:09:51.063 --> 01:09:55.067
Well, you have to admit,
your fiance is acting a little strangely.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:58.487
I mean... look,
why don't I help you with the vows?

01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:01.448
If he's not...
I'll help you with the vows.

01:10:01.574 --> 01:10:05.452
We could incorporate it into the flashmob.
How about that? That's an idea.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:11.041
No, I'd be happy to help.
I know, your brother is so sweet.

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:14.211
Yeah.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.472
(Boy) Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Shepherd Finch.

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.225
(AH) Uh, yeah!

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:35.065
- Yeah, Dad!
- King of bling!

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.611
Mr Shepherd, they're ready for you
in the cake tasting.

01:10:38.736 --> 01:10:40.446
Cakes are on Uncle Henry.

01:10:40.571 --> 01:10:42.865
No, no, no! Please!

01:10:46.535 --> 01:10:48.454
Jeanette, keep the cakes away.

01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:51.790
OK, but only for ten minutes.
Mr Poppy...

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:54.501
Oh... (inaudible)

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:56.462
Mr Shepherd,
please can you help me here?

01:10:56.587 --> 01:10:59.131
Oh, just a little bit of cake, please.

01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:01.425
Under no circumstances
can you go near the cakes, OK?

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:04.178
Would you like a piece
of cake, Uncle Henry?

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:05.721
Yes, I would.

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:09.183
(All) Yeah!

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:10.388
- (Finch) Henri?
- Yes, sir?

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:12.019
It's Bradley Grinch.

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:13.896
Something quite serious has happened.

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:16.649
Some of your...
some of your staff have come into my room

01:11:16.774 --> 01:11:18.359
and have taken half my wardrobe.

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:22.237
- I find that very hard to believe, sir.
- Half my wardrobe, including my jewellery.

01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:23.530
Why would they dry-clean my jewellery?

01:11:23.656 --> 01:11:25.449
My blue jacket's missing,
my dark jacket,

01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:29.828
my leather print jacket, my red jacket
that looks just like that is...

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:32.081
Where did you get that jacket?

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:33.374
Nowhere.

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:36.126
- It looks a lot like my jacket.
- Oh? Lucky you.

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:39.171
- Why are you dressed like me?
- I'm not, I'm dressed like me.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:42.091
- You're dressed like you?
- Just like it's my wedding.

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:43.717
I'm marrying Sophie, not you.

01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:45.344
You know her so well, huh?

01:11:45.469 --> 01:11:46.762
I don't even suppose you know

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:49.098
what sort of cake
she would like, do ya, Shepherd?

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:51.558
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Which one?

01:11:51.684 --> 01:11:54.269
- Not telling.
- Well, it's the strawberry cream.

01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:58.315
I'm glad you're so happy with the cakes.
Why don't you have a bit more?

01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:00.859
Leg it!

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:06.407
That is it! Mr Shepherd!

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.369
(Woman screaming)

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:12.413
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:15.249
Mr Poppy, in here.

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:20.170
Mr Shepherd!

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.881
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:24.883
(Mr Shepherd in a woman's voice)
Are you looking for those kids?

01:12:25.009 --> 01:12:27.469
- Yes, I am.
- They went that way.

01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:28.637
Thank you.

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:34.435
Listen, when I went
into Bradley Finch's room,

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.894
he was on the phone to Sophie

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:38.731
and he was saying he was gonna help her
with her wedding vows.

01:12:38.856 --> 01:12:40.736
They're the most important part
of the ceremony.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:42.818
He shouldn't be doing that, you should.

01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:45.070
- I don't think I can do it.
- You've got to do it.

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:47.906
I don't remember her,
I don't remember any time with her.

01:12:48.032 --> 01:12:52.995
- I haven't got any memory.
- You haven't even kissed her yet.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.371
I know. I tried.

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:57.207
I tried but she wouldn't have it.
I got the side of her head.

01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:58.333
But you need to kiss her.

01:12:58.459 --> 01:12:59.501
Then your memories
might come flooding back.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:01.128
How am I gonna kiss her?

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:03.172
Tomorrow, take her for dinner.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:04.923
Wine her, dine her.

01:13:05.049 --> 01:13:07.885
We could bring some mistletoe into action
and finish off with a kiss

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:09.261
and then the memories will come back.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:12.097
If only you hadn't fallen out of the apple
tree none of this would have happened.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:15.100
- I know.
- Let's go and find the children.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.465
- Bradley, there you are.
- Ssh.

01:13:17.019 --> 01:13:18.645
(Whispering) What? What?

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:20.606
He's lost his memory.

01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:23.275
Who?

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.155
- Shepherd.
- Shut up!

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.491
- Fell out of a tree.
- No.

01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:32.367
- Gone.
- Gotta tell my sister.

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:36.663
No, no, no, not yet.
I'm sure we can use this to our advantage.

01:13:36.789 --> 01:13:38.373
Ah!

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:50.302
You're at the altar, I presume, and this
is where you want to have your vows.

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.679
Go and get the others.

01:13:52.805 --> 01:13:55.891
I would say, "I've loved you
since the first day we met."

01:13:55.974 --> 01:13:57.851
That should be you, Dad.

01:13:57.976 --> 01:14:00.771
- He looks like he really likes her.
- He does really like her.

01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:03.190
He's gonna eat her.

01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:05.943
I have loved you
since the day I saw you.

01:14:06.068 --> 01:14:07.736
Time's running out, Mr Shepherd.

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:10.864
You have to speak to Uncle Henry
and book a table at the restaurant.

01:14:10.989 --> 01:14:12.491
Come on.

01:14:14.409 --> 01:14:17.162
- What are we gonna do, kids?
- (Lauren) I've got an idea.

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:20.207
My dad can re-propose to her.
I've still got the ring.

01:14:20.332 --> 01:14:23.085
Brilliant!
We could hide it in the food maybe.

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:26.296
You could give them one piece of spaghetti
for them to share

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:30.759
and then they'll go closer
and closer and closer and kiss.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.886
- And the magic's in.
- Yes!

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:35.973
Lauren, make sure
Daddy orders spaghetti.

01:14:38.016 --> 01:14:41.395
- Excuse me.
- (Sophie) Oh, Lauren.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:43.730
- My dad wants to take you out to dinner.
- Oh!

01:14:43.856 --> 01:14:46.692
- It's gonna be in the pizza restaurant.
- Will you tell him yes?

01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:48.819
Oh!

01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:51.280
Keep your hands off Sophie.

01:14:54.283 --> 01:14:55.826
- (Sighs)
- Kids!

01:14:55.993 --> 01:15:00.330
- Oh, so sweet.
- So... sweet.

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:03.584
- I'll just give you the menu.
- Thank you.

01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:06.795
Rodrigo recommends
the pizza is excellent here.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.299
Jeremy, listen, I've got
a really sneaking suspicion

01:15:10.424 --> 01:15:11.633
that there's something wrong.

01:15:11.717 --> 01:15:12.885
Not with me.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:15.679
It's OK if there is, OK?

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:17.973
But you've got to tell me.
Is it wedding nerves?

01:15:18.056 --> 01:15:19.975
- Just a little bit jangly?
- No, no.

01:15:21.185 --> 01:15:23.604
- No, I'm really well.
- Because if you don't want to get married...

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:26.648
I do. I do want to get married.
I really want to get married.

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:27.858
- To me?
- To you.

01:15:27.983 --> 01:15:29.735
- Here?
- I wanna get married to you here.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.820
- In...
- And kiss and just...

01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:34.823
- What?
- Carry on our lives.

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:36.366
- Pasta!
- Check.

01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.076
- Sauce.
- Check.

01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:40.078
- Basil.
- Check.

01:15:40.204 --> 01:15:41.663
- Ring.
- Check.

01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:42.788
Come on.

01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:44.374
Shall we order?

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.585
- Sorry.
- Whoa!

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:50.881
Don't allow the ladies to take the order.
The order comes from man usually.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:54.092
I don't think it does.
Can I have the menu?

01:15:54.259 --> 01:15:55.344
- Give me the menu.
- Spaghetti.

01:15:55.469 --> 01:15:56.470
Yes, of course.

01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:59.598
- I don't want spaghetti, Jeremy.
- Let's have spaghetti.

That was amazing.

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:41.366
That's why you brought
all these children here.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:44.911
- It hasn't worked.
- What do you mean it hasn't worked?

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:48.206
The kiss, it just didn't work.
Nothing happened to me.

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:53.003
- What are you saying now?
- Nothing happened.

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:55.547
- Didn't you feel anything?
- No, nothing.

01:17:57.007 --> 01:18:00.677
Nothing happened?
I knew you didn't wanna get married.

01:18:07.684 --> 01:18:10.520
She didn't even find the ring.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.690
Mr Poppy! Children!

01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:15.317
What are you doing here? Out!

01:18:15.442 --> 01:18:18.403
Get out of my restaurant.
Move it, move it, move it.

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:22.449
And you, Mr Poppy.
And you can take that moustache off.

01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:32.250
Mr Shepherd? You left me
to put the kids to sleep on my own.

01:18:32.376 --> 01:18:35.629
I had to read them a story and do the
voices. You could have helped out.

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:38.632
- Sorry.
- Room for a little one?

01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:41.468
Sure, yeah.

01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:44.262
- That was a real mess.
- You can't give up now.

01:18:45.389 --> 01:18:47.974
Come on, we're in the city of dreams.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.726
The Big Apple.

01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:52.687
This whole place was built
on people's dreams.

01:18:53.188 --> 01:18:56.608
Don't let Lauren's dream disappear,
Mr Shepherd.

01:18:57.401 --> 01:18:59.277
Remember what Father Christmas said?

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:04.199
If you don't believe, you won't receive.

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:09.663
How can he do this to you?

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:12.416
You know, this should be
the happiest time of your life.

01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:16.503
- I don't know.
- It's like he's totally changed character.

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:17.963
What am I gonna do?

01:19:18.088 --> 01:19:21.883
If he's not the man for you,
the time to call it off is now.

01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:24.719
We're only gonna get
one more chance at best.

01:19:24.845 --> 01:19:27.305
We've got to give this
our absolute everything.

01:19:27.431 --> 01:19:29.850
I don't know what it was last night
that went wrong, Mr Shepherd.

01:19:29.975 --> 01:19:33.603
It might have been the spicy sauce.
It could have been the pasta.

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:34.813
It might have been your breath.

01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:38.650
But we've got to give this our everything.

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:42.195
We want you to be happy
and be with the right man.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.322
Yes, the right man.

01:19:45.574 --> 01:19:47.075
(Knock on door)

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:56.918
Oh, sorry. I didn't realise
everyone was going to be in here.

01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:59.723
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me in front of my family.

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:03.341
Can I just say there is no way
you're gonna fit into that dress?

01:20:03.467 --> 01:20:04.718
It's tiny.

01:20:05.469 --> 01:20:06.720
What do you want?

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.346
Can I just say, people are allowed...

01:20:08.472 --> 01:20:11.766
Sorry, I'm finding this really difficult
with you lot listening.

01:20:11.892 --> 01:20:14.728
Is there any chance
you might just put your hands on your ears?

01:20:16.688 --> 01:20:18.857
- Come on, Grandma.
- Oh!

01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:21.182
Can you just give him another chance,
for Lauren's sake?

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:24.863
Of course.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:29.159
OK. Come on,
we'll just leave those there.

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:37.292
Please, Sophie,
can I have one more chance?

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:39.628
Just one more date?

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:42.881
Because, Sophie, you're...
You're Lauren's Christmas wish.

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.509
You're my Christmas future,

01:20:45.634 --> 01:20:48.261
all wrapped up in one Christmas present.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.347
And I promise I'll never
let you down again.

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:51.640
I promise.

01:20:53.058 --> 01:20:57.062
All right, Jeremy.
I will give you one more chance.

01:20:58.647 --> 01:21:03.985
You can meet me
at the Park restaurant at two o'clock.

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:08.698
But if you arrive one minute past two,
one second past two o'clock,

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:11.409
I will take that as a sign

01:21:11.535 --> 01:21:13.828
that you don't want to marry me.

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:17.040
And this was all lovely.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.626
Sophie.

01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:21.086
Thank you.

01:21:26.174 --> 01:21:29.594
Yes! Guys, give me five.
Give me five.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.680
(All) Jellyfish.

01:21:31.805 --> 01:21:34.724
Big jellyfish.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:22:00.208
- Head's office?
- Yeah, just down there, through that door.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.891
You've got poo on your head.

01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:19.477
Donkey poo.

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:20.687
Donkey poo.

01:22:20.812 --> 01:22:22.230
Archie's.

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:29.863
Does someone want to tell me
what's going on?

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:32.407
Ah, Mr Shepherd, how lovely to see you.
Do you know, I've been looking for...

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:35.160
Oh, you're not Mr Shepherd.
Who are you?

01:22:35.285 --> 01:22:38.246
- Er... Mr Parker.
- Mr Parker, the inspector.

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:40.332
Could you give us a little bit more time

01:22:40.457 --> 01:22:42.417
just because we want to be
absolutely ready for you?

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.836
- Well, that's why I'm here.
- What do you mean?

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:49.299
I've been sent by Mrs Bevan to help bring
you up to standard for the big inspection.

01:22:49.424 --> 01:22:52.010
- But you are the inspector.
- No.

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:53.511
- You're not the inspector?
- No.

01:22:53.678 --> 01:22:55.138
So wait a second...

01:22:55.263 --> 01:22:58.516
You're the super teacher,
not the inspector.

01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:01.019
So where's Mr Shepherd
and who's he?

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:03.063
- Mr Shepherd.
- Hi, Henry.

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:04.272
Hi, alone at last.

01:23:04.356 --> 01:23:09.235
I just wanted to apologise, really, for
the way that the evening went last night.

01:23:09.361 --> 01:23:11.696
I shouldn't have shouted at Mr Poppy
and the children like that, I mean...

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.698
I was wondering
how long that was gonna take.

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:17.661
Thanks for the apology, Uncle Henry,
but Mr Shepherd's got a very important date

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:20.622
and, if you'll excuse us,
we need to have a man-on-man.

01:23:20.747 --> 01:23:22.499
Come on, Mr Shepherd.

01:23:22.624 --> 01:23:23.625
- But...
- Oh!

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:26.044
And thanks for looking after the children.

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:27.921
The children? I...

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:31.091
- (All) Boo!
- Oh, no.

01:23:35.762 --> 01:23:37.722
Don't worry, Mr Shepherd,
you're gonna be fine.

01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:39.474
Big daddy breaths.

01:23:39.557 --> 01:23:41.351
And don't forget, when on a date,

01:23:41.476 --> 01:23:42.644
keep your hands clean,

01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:45.522
keep your nose clean
and keep your burn clean.

01:23:47.232 --> 01:23:48.733
Good luck.

01:23:53.405 --> 01:23:55.365
Ah, Jeremy!

01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:58.201
Look, I know that we
haven't seen eye to eye

01:23:58.326 --> 01:24:00.995
but I think it's time
we had a man-to-man talk.

01:24:01.121 --> 01:24:03.081
- What?
- I don't think

01:24:03.206 --> 01:24:05.006
it's going to work out
between you and Sophie.

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:09.671
I only say that because she doesn't want
to marry you anymore.

01:24:09.796 --> 01:24:12.090
- How do you know that?
- Because she told me.

01:24:12.215 --> 01:24:15.093
She loves me again, Jeremy,

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:19.180
and the only reason
why she's been hanging on

01:24:19.347 --> 01:24:22.183
is because of... Lauren.

01:24:22.308 --> 01:24:23.560
You're lying.

01:24:23.685 --> 01:24:26.438
- And what about you?
- What about me? I'm not lying.

01:24:26.563 --> 01:24:28.403
You haven't told her
that you lost your memory.

01:24:29.566 --> 01:24:32.694
Poppy hasn't told her,
and what has Poppy been telling you?

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:34.612
That he's the headmaster of the school?

01:24:34.779 --> 01:24:38.616
- He is the headmaster of the school.
- He's an unqualified teaching assistant.

01:24:40.952 --> 01:24:42.537
Maybe you should listen to me instead.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.956
- Which one are you again?
- Charlie, Sophie's brother.

01:24:45.081 --> 01:24:46.082
Yes.

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:48.543
Listen, I'm sorry.
He's telling the truth.

01:24:48.626 --> 01:24:52.630
She doesn't love you anymore.
I think it's time for you to move on.

01:24:56.593 --> 01:24:59.053
(Sophie) 'If you arrive
one second past two o'clock

01:24:59.179 --> 01:25:02.724

that you don't want to marry me.'

01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:05.393

'First things first,
how's the inspector?'

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.651
'The inspector's turned up
but he's not the inspector.'

01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:16.112
- What?
- He's the super teacher.

01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:19.073
The super teacher's here.
Mr Shepherd's here with me.

01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:21.910
(All) Mr Shepherd's the inspector.

01:25:22.035 --> 01:25:23.787
