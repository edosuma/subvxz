WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:05.873
Ah, Clark?
Yeah.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.541
Can I ask you
a question?

00:07.608 --> 00:10.911
You know, and not as a boss
to a...underling.

00:10.978 --> 00:14.315
You know,
just as two dudes talking.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.117
Does this suit
make me look fat?

00:18.186 --> 00:20.654
No, dude.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.358
Uh, since the holidays my belt
is telling a different story.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.095
Oh, then I guess you just need
to be more disciplined.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.196
Ah.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.098
More disciplined.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.399
Ah, thanks, Clark.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.700
You've got the job.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.235
The job? What job?

00:34.302 --> 00:36.470
Effective immediately,
you are my new food cop.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.005
Yeah, you see me
eating garbage,

00:38.072 --> 00:39.573
you stop me
by any means necessary.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.142
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm the best person for this.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.710
I actually find it really
hard to assert myself.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.044
You're doing it.
Yes, sir.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.814
Oh, okay, so,
regarding the doughnut.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.450
You stay the hell out
of my business,
you son of a bitch!

00:50.784 --> 00:53.721
Whoa, sorry,
I thought you wanted me to...

00:53.787 --> 00:55.423
No, no, you're nailing it,
Clark.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.657
You're doing terrific,

00:56.724 --> 00:58.726
and I'm really grateful to you
for this, Clark.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.828
Hey, Clark just
fat-shamed me.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.200
Okay.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.901
Okay. Okay.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.139
Okay.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.706
Just spit it out, Ken.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.276
Okay.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.712
Okay.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.048
Molly has a new boyfriend,
and he's coming over tonight.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.251
Allison,
I was building it up.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.653
You know how Clark
likes a build-up!

01:26.854 --> 01:29.723
Anyway,
I think he's the one.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.426
Okay, slow down,
we haven't even met him yet.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.594
Don't need to.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.296
He comes
from a great family,

01:35.363 --> 01:37.331
and he's pre-med
at UCLA...

01:37.398 --> 01:38.766
Oh, so he's older
than Molly?

01:38.832 --> 01:41.001
Just by a year.
Which is perfect

01:41.068 --> 01:44.138
because he's already
blazing the college trail
she'll be on.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.341
Plus, he's Korean,
not a requirement,
but a happy bonus.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.942
Mm-hmm.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.479
And let's face it,
it's like she found a way
to date her dad,

01:51.545 --> 01:53.514
except, you know,
more in her league.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.585
Yo, guess where
I just was?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.353
The land
of the angry people.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.422
Uh, the Bahamas?
Chipotle?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.890
Oh, doing
a Chipotle run?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.092
Pat, it's 9:30
in the morning.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.728
You watch yourself.
I eat when I want to eat.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.931
I was on the 15th
floor dropping off papers
to endocrinology.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.000
So I'm standing there,
can't find a receptionist,

02:13.066 --> 02:14.902
but there's some lady sitting
behind the desk

02:14.968 --> 02:16.504
like she owns it...
in a nice skirt,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.339
a silk blouse,
and a chartreuse belt

02:18.406 --> 02:20.874
to pull the whole damn thing
together.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.876
So, I ask the lady,

02:22.943 --> 02:25.078
"Excuse me, do you know
where the receptionist is?"

02:25.145 --> 02:26.714
And do you know
what she said to me?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.616
She said,
"I'm the receptionist."

02:28.682 --> 02:29.783
(GASPS)

02:29.850 --> 02:32.620
So, I said,
"Uh, you can't be
the receptionist

02:32.686 --> 02:34.222
"because here at Welltopia,

02:34.288 --> 02:36.957
"all non-medical personnel
must wear scrubs."

02:37.024 --> 02:40.794
And do you know what she fixed
her face to say to me?

02:42.330 --> 02:45.966
She said. "That's not true.
Who told you that?"

02:46.033 --> 02:48.302
Who told me that, Pat?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.607
Okay. Fine.
I may have misled you

02:53.674 --> 02:56.244
into thinking you had to wear
scrubs all the time,

02:56.310 --> 02:58.212
but I like it to
be clear who everyone is.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.914
I mean, you know,
you've seen for yourself
up in endocrinology,

03:00.981 --> 03:02.650
it's like
the Wild West up there.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.294
Jae, thank you so much
for the lotus.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.495
It's so sweet of you.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.064
Molly mentioned
they're your favorite.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.333
Aw.
Aw.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.702
So, Jae, I hope
you like seafood,

03:21.769 --> 03:24.505
or whenever Allison cooks,
C minuses.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.540
Well, it looks delicious,
and I love fish.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.108
Oh, tell them
about the catfish.

03:28.175 --> 03:31.412
Oh. When I was little,
my dad used to maker me
go catfishing with him.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.780
He was pretty strict.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.448
Oho, I get that.
(LAUGHS)

03:34.515 --> 03:36.517
Oh, sorry, pop,
I'm nothing without you.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.255
Anyway, in a shallow part
of the lake,

03:41.322 --> 03:44.458
there were people
who would actually use
their fists as bait.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.226
So my dad puts
his fist in there,

03:46.294 --> 03:48.095
and two seconds later,
he starts screaming.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.663
He was bit
by a snapping turtle.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.533
(LAUGHTER)

03:53.967 --> 03:56.103
I did that once.
Caught a shark.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.309
In a lake?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.377
With your fist?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.746
You weren't there.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.482
I got to say, Jae,
you're quite the raconteur.

04:08.549 --> 04:12.019
When my girlfriend
Emily met the family,
she barely said a word.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.922
Then again,
she barely says any words
to anyone, so...

04:14.988 --> 04:16.657
congrats
on all the talking.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.199
What?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.268
I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm looking

04:28.336 --> 04:31.472
at some kind of
time-portal mirror.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.475
You know, it's like present me
watching past me

04:34.542 --> 04:36.410
impressing future you,
which is me.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.045
(CHUCKLES)

04:38.111 --> 04:40.614
I mean,
we have so much in common.

04:40.681 --> 04:44.885
Magnetic charm,
chiseled jawline,

04:44.952 --> 04:46.587
doctor, pre-med.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
Oh, actually,
I'm not pre-med anymore.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.391
Huh?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.460
Yeah, I dropped
out of college.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.027
Wasn't for me.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.598
(LAUGHS)

04:59.132 --> 05:02.269
And a comedian, Allison.
Oh, man.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.771
Ken, I think
he's serious.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.840
Yeah, college
was kind of a waste of time
for what I want to do.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.177
Waste?
How's college a waste...

05:10.243 --> 05:13.681
Where do you get a live
lotus this time of year?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.282
Actually, Dad,
Jae's an artist.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.585
And a really good one.
You should see his stuff.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.187
He does these mixed-medium
pieces that are just amazing.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.122
Uh, so let me...
let me get this straight...

05:22.189 --> 05:24.492
uh, this is UCLA,

05:24.558 --> 05:28.429
and this is you,
um, dropping out?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.366
So should we plant this
outside?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.067
Let's go do it now.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.904
I get how it sounds.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.338
But I had
to follow my heart,

05:38.406 --> 05:40.474
and I have a lot of projects
in the works.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.242
And I have a real job
in the meantime.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.478
Oh, great.
So what are you doing?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.146
I work at Fro-Yo Palace.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.884
It pays the bills,
gives me time for my art,

05:50.951 --> 05:53.621
and allows me to bring home
sweets for my sweetie.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.322
Aw. (GIGGLES)

05:58.992 --> 06:02.262
So, D.K., finish telling us
about your lake shark.

06:02.329 --> 06:05.165
I made it up, just trying to
contribute to conversation.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.739
Bye.
So nice to meet you.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.240
Nice to meet you, too.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.108
I'm just gonna walk Jae
to his car.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.010
(DOOR CLOSES)

06:17.077 --> 06:19.647
No college, Allison.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.715
He dropped out
of college!

06:21.782 --> 06:23.417
To doodle!

06:24.485 --> 06:26.086
Look,
it's not ideal, but...

06:26.153 --> 06:28.288
How did she manage to find
the one Korean kid

06:28.355 --> 06:29.823
who dropped out
of college?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.793
At least get the degree,
then decide to go
be an artist.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.128
Look at me!
Doctor and comedian.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.431
Doctor.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.700
Come on, you can't tell me
you're happy about this!

06:39.767 --> 06:41.535
I'm not!
I'm concerned.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.504
Of course I'd prefer
someone in college.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.305
All right, then
what do we do about it?

06:45.372 --> 06:46.640
Nothing now.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.041
You don't push
the eject button

06:48.108 --> 06:49.510
when there's a little
turbulence,

06:49.577 --> 06:51.445
you wait until the plane
is going down.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.181
Allison, I don't know
what you're saying
right now,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.316
but I'm pretty sure
I disagree.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.986
I'm saying we just have
to see how this plays out.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.354
Oh, I'll tell you
how it's gonna play out.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.593
Molly's gonna throw
it all away to be with
Fro-Yo Picasso.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.028
Vincent van Gogh nowhere.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.333
She's young. Who knows
if it's even gonna last?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.635
But she likes him,

07:14.702 --> 07:16.637
so for now we're gonna
have to get on board.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.872
(SIGHS) Fine.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.675
I'll get on board with
Michelange-low expectations.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
So, what did you think
of Jae?

07:25.713 --> 07:28.649
He's really sweet and...

07:30.283 --> 07:32.653
Yeah, and, um...

07:32.720 --> 07:35.556
I really respect the way
he wears his beanie,

07:35.623 --> 07:37.658
and, um...

07:37.725 --> 07:39.593
I-I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.061
He's a dropout, okay?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.996
Ken!
No, I'm sorry, Mol,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.898
but you're just getting
your life started.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.133
You nailed the SATs,

07:46.199 --> 07:48.401
you're a hair away
from getting into Stanford.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.470
I mean, this guy could
knock you off your path.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.905
Dad, that's not gonna
happen to me.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.007
Oh, yeah?
It happened to my sister.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.644
Wendi was on her way
to Harvard Med School

07:56.710 --> 07:58.579
when Dax the poet
came along.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.181
That mess took six years
to unravel.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.016
Her dreadlocks
took another two.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.119
Well,
I'm not Aunt Wendi.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.188
Then what are you gonna do
if you get into Stanford?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.357
Jae and I have discussed this.
We'll be long distance.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.060
Long distance
never works!

08:13.126 --> 08:15.963
"Oh, I miss your face."
"I miss your face."
Then what?

08:17.531 --> 08:20.000
We also discussed me
transferring somewhere local.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.368
Hear that, Allison?

08:21.434 --> 08:23.604
No more Stanford!
She's throwing
her life away!

08:23.671 --> 08:24.805
This is ridiculous!

08:24.872 --> 08:26.406
Mom, would you tell him
he's crazy?

08:26.473 --> 08:28.441
Well, Mol, there is
a reason for concern.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.944
Oh, my God! You too?
I can't believe you guys!

08:31.011 --> 08:32.680
You know what, why don't we
revisit this later,

08:32.746 --> 08:34.414
when everyone's feeling
a little less emotion...

08:34.481 --> 08:35.849
What's gotten into you,
Molly?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.918
What's your deal?
Why are you doing this?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.386
Because I love him!

08:41.354 --> 08:42.355
What?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.660
I love him.
And he lo...

08:46.727 --> 08:48.228
I forbid this!

08:48.295 --> 08:49.462
Ken!

08:49.529 --> 08:51.832
I forbid you
from seeing Jae!

08:54.101 --> 08:55.603
Good luck with that.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.673
I'm gonna be at Jae's.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.592
Whoa-hoho!
Are you Damona

09:18.659 --> 09:21.028
or my thighs
after a spin class?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
'Cause you are on fire!

09:24.031 --> 09:25.198
Girl, you are...

09:25.265 --> 09:27.300
Yeah, yeah, I look good.
Where's Pat?

09:27.367 --> 09:28.501
Chipotle.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.270
Yeah, we are failing
each other.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.906
(SIGHS) Damn it.
I needed him to see me.

09:32.973 --> 09:37.044
He's gonna hate
how good I look,
and I'm gonna enjoy that.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.847
Never again will I look like
a loser up in here

09:39.913 --> 09:42.850
wearing
some dumpy-ass scrubs.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.219
Okay. But some of us
still have to wear them.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.724
Wow!
What's the occasion?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.559
Tuesday.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.228
Hey, how was meeting
Molly's boyfriend?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.631
Oh, you mean
"Doodles cute paint smear"?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.901
Jae left college
to pursue art,

10:00.968 --> 10:02.770
and Ken had
a strong reaction.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.138
(SCOFFS) Hey, you weren't
thrilled about it either.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.541
But I didn't forbid it,
which is why she's still
speaking to me.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.277
Seriously, what was that?

10:10.343 --> 10:11.611
Korean "Footloose"?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.415
I wish, Allison.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.050
If only we could solve
this problem

10:17.117 --> 10:18.686
by letting the
townspeople dance.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.321
Oh, my God.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.457
Do you realize how hard-core
Korean you sound right now?

10:24.524 --> 10:25.859
Is that what
you think this is?

10:25.926 --> 10:28.561
It's not a Korean thing,
Allison, it's a me thing!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.898
I've worked hard
my entire life...

10:30.964 --> 10:33.701
college, med school,
partner here at Welltopia.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.436
I've made so many sacrifice,
well, so did you!

10:36.503 --> 10:37.838
After her SAT setback,

10:37.905 --> 10:40.708
we're the ones
who helped Molly
get back on track.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.810
She is on the verge
of greatness.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.344
And you think
I'm gonna stand by

10:44.411 --> 10:46.313
and let her get derailed
by Asian Banksy?

10:46.379 --> 10:47.915
I don't think so.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
Ken, stop overreacting!

10:50.050 --> 10:51.685
She hasn't given up
anything yet.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.154
She hasn't dropped out
of school, she's just dating!

10:54.221 --> 10:56.523
She said she loved him.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.125
So what?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.460
I said "I love you"
to a lot of guys.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.432
Is it not clear that
I'm at my breaking point,
Allison?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.836
I'm just saying,

11:08.902 --> 11:11.671
who I dated in high school
didn't derail me.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.641
Well, Jae is gonna derail her.
And that's the truth.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.510
What about the truth
that Molly wants nothing
to do with you?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.250
I got to see a patient.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.657
Clark, I need your ID.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.225
Oh, princess,
you look great,

11:32.292 --> 11:34.461
but no one is going to think
you're underage.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.164
No, I need your badge
for the copy machine.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.498
Oh, where's yours?

11:38.565 --> 11:41.334
Please, I am not gonna let
some ratty-ass plastic ID

11:41.401 --> 11:43.336
ruin my look. Ah!

11:44.872 --> 11:47.775
Again, some of us
are still in uniform.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.142
Oh, this is coming out
too light.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.778
I got to change
the toner.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.980
Yeah, and while you're at it,
maybe you could change
the tone.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.882
You have said
some hurtful things.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.554
Oh!

12:01.621 --> 12:02.990
Oh, no!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.491
(GASPS)

12:04.557 --> 12:07.961
Aww, looks like you got
a little toner on your look.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.939
(SIGHS) Nope.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.744
Ah-choo!

12:26.313 --> 12:27.647
Nope.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.888
Oh, my badge.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

12:41.561 --> 12:42.963
Nope.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.602
Hey, Grandpa,
can you tell Mom I'm not
gonna be home for...

12:54.407 --> 12:57.177
Ooh, she's pissed
at you.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.015
"Ooh, she's pissed at you."

13:03.616 --> 13:07.187
Molly's not speaking to me.
Allison's not thrilled
with me.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.089
Guess I have no beef
with Dave.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.958
Hey, guys.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.126
What are you doing?
You can't have ice cream
before dinner.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.229
Word on the street is
we don't have to listen
to you anymore.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.903
You know what?
This is all your fault.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.905
My family wouldn't be
in shambles

13:24.972 --> 13:28.208
if you hadn't set Molly up
with Crayola Joe.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.510
I didn't know
he dropped out of college.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.979
But it doesn't matter.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.347
What?
Are you kidding me?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.850
You were always riding me
about my school work,

13:36.917 --> 13:38.551
about becoming a doctor,

13:38.618 --> 13:41.421
and you never would have
let me date someone
who wasn't in college.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.622
I wasn't raised that way,

13:42.689 --> 13:44.657
and I'm not raising Molly
that way, either.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.459
Well, maybe you were
raised wrong.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.795
That's right...
wait, what?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.899
One thing I learned
over the years

13:51.965 --> 13:54.801
is that things aren't as
black and white as I thought.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.837
I was born in one country.
I'll die in another.

13:57.905 --> 14:01.141
I was married for 50 years.
Now I'm divorced.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.311
The point is,
my views have evolved.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.480
Dad, those views
that you're talking about
shaped my life.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.116
And I turned out amazing.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.851
Yeah, sure.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.056
But Wendi grew up
in the same house,

14:16.123 --> 14:17.657
and she had her struggles.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.060
It wasn't until later
that I realized

14:20.127 --> 14:22.896
that I caused her to rebel
by being so strict.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.664
But if I grew up
in a free-for-all,

14:24.731 --> 14:27.100
I would never have
accomplished the things
that I did.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.235
True.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.070
But this is about Molly.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.504
Molly is not you.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.006
Maybe this guy is the one,

14:33.073 --> 14:35.075
or maybe not
and they'll break up.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.145
Either way,
you need to be
there for her.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.812
Trust me,
it took me years

14:39.879 --> 14:41.982
to repair my relationship
with Wendi.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.052
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.456
Hey, Dad, if Molly never
forgives you and moves out,

14:49.522 --> 14:51.324
can I take over her room?

14:52.926 --> 14:55.595
Wait, what am I
asking you for?
I'll just do it.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.575
Yo!

15:08.641 --> 15:11.444
Hey!
Somebody hear me in there?

15:14.948 --> 15:17.417
Oh, damn it.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.952
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

15:19.019 --> 15:21.088
Hello?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.322
Hello?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.923
(INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES)

15:23.991 --> 15:26.459
I'm getting out of here.
Yo, wait up.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.496
Yo, where the hell
did they go?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.566
Are there ghosts up here?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.435
Yo!

15:35.502 --> 15:37.304
Hey!

15:47.047 --> 15:49.649
Oh. No, no, no, no.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.021
Somebody!

15:54.087 --> 15:56.689
Open this door
before I got to pee!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.659
Great, now I got to pee.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.406
Hi, Dr. Park.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.075
Hello.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.346
Well, I got some toppings
to sort.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.023
What are
you doing here?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.625
I want to talk about you
and Jae.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.095
Well, save it because
I don't need your approval.
I'm okay with it.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.197
Really?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.635
Look, when you said you loved
him, I freaked out.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.404
And I'm sorry.
I...

16:46.039 --> 16:49.442
I've just never heard you
say that before.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.045
Even though
I'm nervous about it,

16:52.112 --> 16:54.914
I just want you to know that
I'm gonna be there for you.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.816
No matter what happens.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.286
(SIGHS)

16:59.352 --> 17:02.589
Thanks, Dad.
I really needed that.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.125
I mean, to be honest,
I'm nervous, too.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.695
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.899
And I don't know
where this is going,

17:14.567 --> 17:17.437
but I do know
that I'm happy right now.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.673
And your happiness is
all that matters to me, Molly.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.277
Look, my biggest fear in life
is seeing

17:24.344 --> 17:27.814
my smart, talented, ambitious
daughter's future derailed,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.016
but I realize I have
to trust

17:30.083 --> 17:34.221
that smart, talented,
ambitious daughter to be
all those things.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.723
Dad, I'll always be
all those things.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.525
I got it from you and Mom.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.931
You know, you don't eject
from the plane

17:44.997 --> 17:47.134
when there's just
turbulence.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.568
What's that mean?

17:48.635 --> 17:49.869
No idea.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.738
It didn't make sense when
your mom said it either.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.206
I thought it might have
been just me.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.242
(LAUGHS)

17:55.308 --> 17:57.009
Mol, I got it.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.011
They just told me
I got it.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.247
Oh, my God. Really?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.548
Yeah.
The gamble paid off.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.715
What?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.552
Jae got this huge
art fellowship at LACMA.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.555
Thank you
for believing in me.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.989
That was all you.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.458
You kidding?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.560
You're more supportive
than my parents.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.462
That's why
you're my muse.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.102
Well, that's great.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.440
Congrats, Jae.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.011
I'm looking
in that mirror again.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.882
And I likes what I see.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.955
Clark, congratulations.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.324
We did it.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.259
I lost a pound
and a quarter.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.394
Good.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.196
Uh, granted I had
a shave and a haircut,

18:49.262 --> 18:50.663
so it could be
a little less.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.766
I couldn't have done it
without you.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.302
Well, off to the office.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.869
What's in the bag, Pat?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.271
Huh?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.240
I'm glad you asked.
Mm.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.409
Yeah, it's just a stick
of celery, you know, for my...

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
for my afternoon crudite.
Oh.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.983
Okay, I went to the bakery
and I got a muffin
'cause I'm a monster.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.454
All right.
You know what?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.022
I better
dispose of this myself.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.492
Are you gonna go secretly eat
that in the men's room?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.860
You got me, copper.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.441
Ah!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.510
Excuse me, ma'am,
you can't sleep in here.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.312
Damona?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.281
Oh, Pat.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.615
Ah, come here.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.716
Oh.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.852
I could come here, yes.
Good.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.589
Oh, Pat, I've been here
for hours, no badge,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.824
nobody listening
for the door,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.960
people running when
they hear me, ghosts.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.232
All because I wanted
to wear something nice
to work for once.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.735
Ah. Damona, I'm sorry.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.504
If I'd known it meant
that much to you,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.673
I never would have come up
with that stupid rule.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.508
Oh, Pat, please,
you were right.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.643
Scrubs are appropriate
and comfortable.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.579
I should go put some on
right now.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.881
Or you could just go home...
it's 6:00.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.716
No, Pat,
are you kidding me?

20:16.783 --> 20:19.619
I barely got anything done.
I'm so sorry.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.088
Ah, it's as much my fault
as yours.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.792
Well, maybe a little more
your fault.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.660
What you gonna do
with that muffin?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.505
And this is a mural I did
for a friend of mine

20:38.571 --> 20:39.639
who has a loft downtown.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.040
Ah, that's amazing.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.410
Yeah. I mean,
you went outside
the lines a little bit,

20:43.476 --> 20:44.877
but that's nitpicky.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.748
Jae's really influenced
by the Post-Impressionists.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.884
Ooh, I do
impressions, too.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.622
That's not what
anyone said, Dad.

20:55.688 --> 20:59.592
Borat as a surgeon...
Nurse, my knife.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.198
They don't get it.
They're not artists
like you and me.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.903
Word on the street is
we have to start listening
to you again.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.605
Yep.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.774
Oh, well, it was fun
while it lasted.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.778
Ooh, I see you're influenced
by Gauguin.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.750
Oh, Al Pacino
sneezing backwards...

21:23.816 --> 21:25.318
Choo-ah.
