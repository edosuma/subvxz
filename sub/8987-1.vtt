00:46.548 --> 00:49.509
This way, please. Ladies
and gentlemen, this way, please.

00:51.845 --> 00:53.138
Follow me.

00:56.516 --> 00:58.268
Round there, please.

00:59.311 --> 01:00.604
Thank you.

01:11.073 --> 01:13.825
From the dynasty
of Akbar the Magnificent,

01:14.034 --> 01:18.288
and for over a thousand years,
our nation's religious symbol,

01:18.538 --> 01:19.957
the Pink Panther.

01:20.165 --> 01:23.293
Largest and most famous diamond
in the world.

01:23.502 --> 01:28.006
Irreplaceable, its value cannot
be estimated in terms of money.

01:28.257 --> 01:31.260
Isn't the museum worried
that someone might steal it?

01:32.261 --> 01:33.929
The Pink Panther is protected,

01:34.179 --> 01:37.766
and by forces
more impenetrable than any army.

01:38.016 --> 01:39.893
Observe.

01:46.108 --> 01:47.693
Deactivate.

01:49.778 --> 01:51.822
Failing the radar shield,

01:52.030 --> 01:55.909
the slightest release of pressure
in the weight of the diamond,

01:56.118 --> 01:59.788
and the would-be thief is a prisoner.

02:00.038 --> 02:02.749
A prisoner of the Pink Panther.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.217
Why is it called the Pink Panther?

02:13.135 --> 02:14.928
The stone is flawed.

02:15.137 --> 02:18.098
If it is held up to the light
in a certain way,

02:18.306 --> 02:22.394
the figure of a springing panther
can be seen clearly.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.369
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.874
My department has already
begun rounding up suspects.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.293
His Majesty has been
informed of the theft.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.295
He is flying home from Washington.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.840
- I expect an arrest any moment now.
- I do not share your optimism.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.301
We know the culprit
is within our borders.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.429
All airports and railway stations
are being watched.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.640
While your men search for this man
with the Dutch passport

16:13.891 --> 16:16.852
who rented the hotel room,
he has thrown away his passport

16:17.060 --> 16:20.272
and is making ready to leave
the country under a new identity.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.775
- When we find the fingerprints...
- If you find them...

16:23.984 --> 16:29.281
You are both in trouble. But if we do
what is necessary and conventional.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.074
I am calling in outside help.

16:32.042 --> 16:34.276
The famous French detective
who recovered the Pink Panther

16:34.376 --> 16:36.360
the last time it was stolen.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.291
- What was his name?
- Clouseau.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.420
Inspector Clouseau.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.277
- Do you have a licence?
- Monsieur?

17:08.028 --> 17:11.448
City ordinance 47-B
prohibits the playing

17:11.698 --> 17:15.077
of any musical instrument
in a public place for the purpose

17:15.285 --> 17:17.663
of commercial enterprise
without a licence.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.247
I don't understand.

17:19.455 --> 17:23.542
It is against the law for you
to play your musical instrument.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.127
- The leur?
- What?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.005
You say it's against the law?

17:27.214 --> 17:29.341
Yes, unless you have a proper licence.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.926
What kind of licence?

17:31.134 --> 17:35.514
A licence that permits the playing
of any musical instrument

17:35.722 --> 17:39.559
in a public place for the purpose
of commercial enterprise.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.478
- Commercial enterprise?
- Yes.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.231
You play that thing
and people give you the money.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.900
People give the monkey the money.

17:47.150 --> 17:50.320
- It is the same.
- Not at all, monsieur.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.782
I am a musician
and the monkey is a businessman.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.826
He doesn't tell me what to play,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.328
and I don't tell him
what to do with his money.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.747
Monsieur, don't try to be funny with me.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.750
He is your monkey,
therefore it is your money!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.420
He lives with me,
but he is not my monkey.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.589
One day I came home and
found him in the living room!

18:09.840 --> 18:12.509
I let him stay, but he pays
for his own room and board.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.761
Then the monkey's breaking the law.

18:14.970 --> 18:18.974
But he doesn't play
any musical instrument.

18:19.433 --> 18:23.687
City ordinance 132-R
prohibits the begging.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.857
How do you know so much
about city ordinances?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.151
What sort of stupid question is that,

18:29.359 --> 18:31.153
- are you blind?
- Yes.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.115
Oh, I see, yes. Yes, of course.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.784
You happen to be talking
to a police officer,

18:38.034 --> 18:40.328
and because I expect
to be transferred back

18:40.537 --> 18:42.998
to the Detective Division at any moment,

18:43.206 --> 18:45.625
I will let you off this time
with just a warning.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.669
Thank you, Monsieur Agent.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.547
But you must get yourself
a proper licence.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.257
First thing tomorrow.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.468
Try to do something
about your filthy monkey.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.892
Halt! Just a moment!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.686
Move, move!

19:05.562 --> 19:07.355
Over there! <i>Arretez!</i>

19:11.985 --> 19:12.861
Idiot!

19:12.986 --> 19:14.779
How was I to know
he was the bank manager?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.948
How were you to know
the bank was being robbed?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.034
- That is correct.
- What is correct?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.494
I did not know the bank was being robbed

19:21.703 --> 19:25.582
because I was engaged
in my sworn duty as a police officer.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.502
You didn't even arrest the old beggar.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.505
There was some question
as to whether the beggar

19:32.756 --> 19:34.507
or his minkey was breaking the law.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.967
- "Minkey"?
- What?

19:36.176 --> 19:37.218
You said "minkey"!

19:37.427 --> 19:39.888
That is correct, yes, chimpanzee monkey.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.599
So I let them both off with a warning.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.019
The beggar
was the lookout man for the gang.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.229
- That is impossible.
- Why?

19:48.438 --> 19:51.066
He was blind.
How can a blind man be a lookout?

19:51.316 --> 19:53.401
How can an idiot be a policeman? Answer!

19:53.652 --> 19:55.737
It's simple, all he has to do is enlist.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.238
Shut up!

19:58.698 --> 20:02.243
- How do you know he was blind?
- Because he told me so.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.537
Oh, he told you so.
And you believed him?

20:04.788 --> 20:06.414
I had no reason to doubt him.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.001
Do you believe me if I tell you

20:10.210 --> 20:13.004
that I'm not going to get you
suspended for six months?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.799
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so, sir. Yes.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.176
Because I'm a bigger liar
than the beggar.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.720
You are suspended
for six months without pay.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.431
- Six months?
- Effective immediately.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.517
Have you anything to say?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.812
Could you lend me 50 francs?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.855
Will you get out of my sight!

20:31.064 --> 20:33.900
- Yes.
- Idiot.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.072
My blood pressure.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.241
Idiot.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.369
One day, François.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.497
One day I'll be rid of him forever.
That'll be the day.

20:47.747 --> 20:52.001
- Something on your mind?
- An order from the commissioner.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.838
- Oh, yes?
- It concerns Clouseau.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.214
Yes? Go on.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.883
He is to be reinstated as an inspector.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.053
What? You can't be serious.

21:02.262 --> 21:08.101
And he is to report immediately
to a Colonel Sharki in Lugash.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.228
I see.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.570
- Sir!
- What?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.281
It's a birthday gift from my wife.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.576
Most realistic.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.579
Get me the commissioner.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.669
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calling.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.589
The commissioner.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.883
Commissioner,

21:40.133 --> 21:44.345
I have just received your instructions
to send Clouseau to Lugash,

21:44.554 --> 21:48.016
but you see, he's no longer
with the Sûreté, I've just given him...

21:48.224 --> 21:49.309
Yes, but...

21:50.226 --> 21:54.022
Yes, but since France and Lugash
have been allies for nearly 200 years,

21:54.230 --> 21:57.066
it might be a serious mistake
to send someone who is...

21:57.567 --> 21:59.569
I see. Yes, of course.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.989
Very good, commissioner.

22:07.076 --> 22:12.040
It seems the Shah of Lugash
telephoned the president personally

22:12.248 --> 22:15.543
and asked for Clouseau
to be assigned to the case.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.091
- The Shah of Lugash.
- Incredible.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.093
All right, François.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.352
The Shah of Lugash.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.920
<i>...the capital earlier this
morning. It seems that the army...</i>

23:04.050 --> 23:07.178
<i>by sealing the area
around the president's palace.</i>

23:07.387 --> 23:10.139
<i>Highs for the coast...</i>

23:10.390 --> 23:12.266
Oh, good evening, Madame Landlord.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.310
<i>...against the price increases...</i>

23:14.560 --> 23:18.064
Good evening. I was just reading
the headlines in your newspaper.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.693
<i>...opposition</i> is...

23:21.901 --> 23:24.112
Good evening.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.288
Cato?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.624
Cato!

26:02.728 --> 26:04.897
Monsieur Clouseau's residence.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.732
One moment, please.

26:06.983 --> 26:09.819
For you. Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.710
- Yes, sir.
- <i>You're back on the force.</i>

26:25.918 --> 26:28.129
Come to my office... immediately!

26:30.423 --> 26:32.008
Immediately, sir.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.595
Well, Cato, I am back on the force.

26:40.683 --> 26:44.478
You know, Cato,
your freezer ambush ploy...

26:44.687 --> 26:46.689
I really congratulate you.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.607
It was very, very good.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.778
But Cato, your fly is undone.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.368
And so, my friend, are you!

27:11.130 --> 27:13.299
Yes, my little yellow friend.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.968
I knew the chief
would have to reconsider.

27:16.719 --> 27:20.306
He did not get where he is
by ignoring a man's qualifications.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.768
He knows that I am unique
and therefore indispensable.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.437
We are much the same, the chief and I.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.565
But of course, Cato,
all great detectives

27:29.815 --> 27:32.318
have one thing in common.
You know what that is?

27:33.235 --> 27:34.236
Instinct.

27:34.403 --> 27:38.616
That rare ability to know immediately
without having to stop and reason.

27:38.824 --> 27:43.120
And in my business it can easily mean
the difference between life and death.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.456
All right, I'll get it.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.170
Thank you.

27:53.005 --> 27:58.344
Yes, that split-second timing
when instinct tells you...

27:58.928 --> 28:00.012
that...

28:00.179 --> 28:02.348
Ah... Aghh!

28:02.598 --> 28:04.225
<i>...new wave of assassinations.</i>

28:07.603 --> 28:10.648
<i>...the opposition spokesman
has categorically denied...</i>

28:10.856 --> 28:12.483
Infamous powers are at work.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.028
The instant you assign me to a case,
the underworld hears about it

28:16.278 --> 28:18.072
and I am set upon.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.490
Cato is in hospital.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.661
They nearly blew his yellow skin off.
It's amazing that I am still alive.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.704
Amazing is not the word.

28:26.455 --> 28:30.084
Do I detect something in your voice
that says I am in disfavour with you?

28:30.292 --> 28:31.460
Yes.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.420
I wish you were dead.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.631
You are entitled to your opinion.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.050
And you are not! Out! Out of my sight!

28:38.300 --> 28:40.219
You want me to leave?

28:40.636 --> 28:42.972
If you are not out
of this room in five seconds,

28:43.222 --> 28:45.349
I shall not be responsible
for my actions!

28:45.557 --> 28:48.394
Five seconds is nothing,
I can easily be out in three.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.480
- But if you really want me to leave...
- I've had enough!

28:52.147 --> 28:54.066
Oh, thank you very much.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.989
A very amusing clever little gadget.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.450
Very realistic, but, of course,
my instinct told me that...

29:07.079 --> 29:10.582
Something the matter?
You're not feeling well?

29:10.833 --> 29:12.418
My blood pressure.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.795
Must take my pill. You're killing me.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.589
Yes. Perhaps some water.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.346
You have a defective carafe.
Allow me to blot you.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.432
- Idiot!
- I will blot you.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.351
I had an aunt who suffered
from high blood pressure.

29:29.518 --> 29:33.105
She was attended successfully
by Dr August Balls of Nice.

29:35.190 --> 29:38.318
And after he had attended her
for several weeks, she... Oh.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.159
Obviously, out of fluid.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.871
Perhaps you would like me
to fill it for you?

29:53.042 --> 29:55.711
Now just... just... Please just go away.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.463
Yes.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.214
Well, all right, inspector.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.092
I will leave, but remember,

30:02.301 --> 30:05.054
I will be at your service night or day.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.349
Of course, I will be
on assignment in Lugash.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.895
Fortunately there is,
I believe, some difference in time.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.816
My watch seems to have stopped,
probably due to the explosion.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.738
You need a new flint.

30:24.072 --> 30:29.411
Well, chief inspector, until we
meet again and the case is solv-ed.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.667
"The case is solv-ed!" Idiot!

30:56.271 --> 30:58.148
Don’t just stand there, idiot.

30:58.357 --> 31:02.820
Call a doctor,
and then help me find my nose!

31:14.456 --> 31:16.041
Inspector!

31:18.043 --> 31:20.546
A very interesting museum you have here.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.343
- Inspector...
- Please tell me nothing.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.763
I prefer to investigate the
scene of the crime spontaneously.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.558
That way it gives my
trained instincts full rein.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.643
But our security measures...

31:34.893 --> 31:37.271
I'm sure your security measures
are very good.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.815
But, obviously not good enough.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.317
Let me see...

31:49.074 --> 31:51.451
Yes, very effective.
Very effective, indeed.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.953
The element of surprise.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.122
Of course, I knew it would happen.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.457
Nevertheless, the element of surprise.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.752
How very kind of you to welcome me.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.845
Is there any way of getting
in and out of this place

32:10.095 --> 32:12.889
- without this happening all the time?
- Deactivate it.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.058
Deactivate the door.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.360
Hmm.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.240
Yes...

32:33.368 --> 32:35.287
Oh.

32:40.709 --> 32:44.838
Ugh. So we meet again.

33:23.502 --> 33:27.339
- Very ingenious.
- He pulled himself across the floor.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.590
He did?

33:28.757 --> 33:30.801
How else could he avoid the radar field?

33:31.593 --> 33:34.179
Yes, how else? Hmm.

33:34.429 --> 33:38.100
Of course, he would need
a very slippery floor to do that.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.520
- Therefore, the wax.
- The wax? Aah!

33:43.105 --> 33:45.065
Are you all right?

33:45.273 --> 33:49.027
'Course I am all right.
I am examining the wax.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.909
Have you taken a sample of this wax?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.871
- Wax is wax.
- Well, this is where you are wrong.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.873
Wax is not just wax.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.834
In this case it is a clue.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.879
English wax, French wax, domestic wax...

34:08.129 --> 34:12.759
The inspector is right.
Have the wax tested immediately.

34:13.635 --> 34:17.597
It is my guess that
you will find it is English wax.

34:18.223 --> 34:21.016
- Why?
- Because your thief is an Englishman.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.601
How do you know that?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.272
It is my business to know that.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.108
He is Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.777
- The Phantom?
- Yes, one and the same.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.909
His calling card.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.705
Four years ago,
Sir Charles suddenly vanished.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.125
It was rumoured in the underworld...

34:45.333 --> 34:47.252
given up his life of crime,

34:47.502 --> 34:50.672
but my instinct told me
he would not remain in hiding for long.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.632
Four years is not long?

34:52.841 --> 34:56.136
Time is not the issue here,
this glove is the issue here.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.930
It signifies the Phantom
is up to his old tricks.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.684
But I will catch him and root him out.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.645
It won't be easy,
he's a master of disguise.

35:05.854 --> 35:10.984
And, undoubtedly, he has gone
back into hiding until the heat is off.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.165
How is he?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.876
Unlovable.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.054
Has he seen it?

36:21.304 --> 36:24.015
No, I thought
you'd like to show it to him.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.178
- How was Paris?
- Expensive.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.181
- Good. Buy anything foolish?
- Lots.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.351
- How have you been?
- Splendid. Fantastic.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.479
I have created something...

37:11.729 --> 37:14.649
absolutely extraordinary
since breakfast.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.651
- Oh, can I see?
- No, no, no. Not yet.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.611
Come on. Please don't be so...

37:18.820 --> 37:21.322
- The impact might be too strong.
- Let me see.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.533
There you go.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.788
- How about that?
- Hmm.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.957
- You know what?
- What?

37:31.666 --> 37:33.793
I think I came back just in time.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.520
Damn!

37:52.770 --> 37:54.606
- What, darling?
- Listen to this:

37:55.148 --> 37:59.193
"Police today were conducting
a house-to-house search of Lugash

37:59.444 --> 38:02.822
for the thief,
who Monday night stole the fabled

38:03.031 --> 38:05.783
Pink Panther Diamond
from the Royal Museum here.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.535
According to authorities,

38:07.785 --> 38:12.290
the only clue was a white monogrammed
man's glove with the initial "P".

38:13.458 --> 38:15.209
Well, what do you think?

38:15.710 --> 38:19.756
That you didn’t just spend your time
just painting during my absence.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.967
Oh. You think I had something
to do with the robbery.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.344
Didn't you?

38:24.594 --> 38:25.637
You little beast.

38:25.803 --> 38:29.641
Three, no four years ago
I swore to you that I was retiring.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.852
I've been faithful to you ever since.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.440
- In your fashion.
- Now, what the hell does that mean?

38:38.232 --> 38:39.817
That you're being teased.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.071
I believe you, darling.
But you must admit it does sound

38:43.321 --> 38:45.990
like the kind of job only
the Phantom could have done.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.743
I mean, the Pink Panther.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.913
No clues except your
well-known calling card.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.750
Yes. I must admit, the impostor,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.001
very clever.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.128
Very clever, indeed.

38:59.796 --> 39:03.674
I'm surprised half the police force
of France hasn't descended on us by now.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.010
But, of course, they will!

39:06.260 --> 39:08.596
- Without a doubt.
- But if you're innocent...

39:08.846 --> 39:10.431
I'm not only innocent,

39:10.681 --> 39:13.601
I'm smart enough that
if I decided to get back in business,

39:13.851 --> 39:15.645
I wouldn't leave my calling card.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.313
Will the police think that?

39:18.940 --> 39:20.024
No.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.818
But you can convince them.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.863
Not unless the real thief was caught.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.658
But then you are lost.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.369
If the police think
that you are the real thief,

39:32.203 --> 39:36.666
- then who will catch the impostor?
- Hm?

39:38.793 --> 39:43.131
Well, I can only think
of one person really, can't you?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.591
Charles.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.762
Since the alternative is prison,
I don't have very much choice, do I?

39:50.096 --> 39:51.722
I'm frightened.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.392
This impostor is obviously very clever.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.853
He could be dangerous.

39:57.311 --> 39:59.063
Oh, darling.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.483
Not to worry! Trust me.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.734
I may be a bit rusty,

40:03.901 --> 40:06.571
but I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.730
I congratulate you, chief,
on your excellent facilities.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.941
Of course,
you understand that my visit here

40:44.191 --> 40:46.402
must be of the utmost secrecy.

40:46.652 --> 40:50.156
Of course. My department will do
everything possible to assist you.

40:51.616 --> 40:55.620
However, there is one question
that only you can answer.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.623
<i>Oui?</i>

41:00.625 --> 41:05.671
Does Sir Charles Litton
have a swimming pool?

41:05.880 --> 41:08.507
A swimming pool?

41:13.763 --> 41:16.515
- Back before you know it.
- Take care.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.537
Now, what identity
will you travel under?

41:38.788 --> 41:41.248
Well, I shall be...

41:41.499 --> 41:44.377
dreary old Sir Charles Litton
leaving the country.

41:45.419 --> 41:46.545
And...

41:47.380 --> 41:48.798
fearless...

41:49.006 --> 41:53.969
dashing young doctor
Marvin Tanny arriving in Lugash.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.181
Watch it!

42:46.981 --> 42:48.816
I have the report here.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.485
Someone has trifled with your brakes.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.737
The underworld will stop at nothing.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.739
It's the second attempt on my life.

42:55.948 --> 42:59.118
I may have caught my death of pneumon...

43:07.168 --> 43:09.128
Gesundheit.

45:00.864 --> 45:04.284
I have fixed your doorbell
from the ringing.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.537
There is no charge.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.456
Thank you. What do you want?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.750
I am from the telephone company,

45:11.959 --> 45:14.461
there is something
the matter with your pheun.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.630
- My "pheun"?
- What?

45:16.880 --> 45:19.800
You said there's something
the matter with my "pheun".

45:20.050 --> 45:22.219
- Yes.
- My phone?

45:22.469 --> 45:24.930
That is correct,
yes, that is what I been saying.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.266
No trouble with the telephones here.

45:27.474 --> 45:30.853
I know when there is a trouble,
and when there is not a trouble.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.106
And I can definitely tell you
that there is a trouble,

45:34.314 --> 45:36.984
- you may rest assured of that.
- Since when?

45:37.234 --> 45:39.445
Since it was reported.

45:39.903 --> 45:42.573
I see. What is the trouble
with the telephones?

45:42.823 --> 45:44.825
If I knew that,
I could simply call you up

45:45.075 --> 45:46.743
and tell you what the trouble is.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.912
What's the trouble?

45:49.746 --> 45:52.332
This man says we have
trouble with our telephones.

45:52.583 --> 45:56.003
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Emile Flournoy,

45:56.253 --> 45:58.839
communications expert
and chief trouble-shooter

45:59.089 --> 46:02.634
- for the Nice Telephone Company.
- Please come in, monsieur.

46:19.526 --> 46:21.111
Now what can we do to help you?

46:22.112 --> 46:24.656
Which is your nearest phone?

46:25.282 --> 46:27.701
- There.
- What?

46:27.951 --> 46:29.745
Ah, yes...

46:30.704 --> 46:33.081
Hmm.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.627
Yes, this phone will not do at all.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.588
Show me another phone.
It won't do at all, I'm afraid.

46:39.796 --> 46:42.799
- Show Monsieur Flour...
- Flournoy!

46:43.050 --> 46:47.012
Flournoy... the telephone
in Sir Charles's study.

46:50.557 --> 46:52.684
I hope you locate the trouble, monsieur.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.562
Madame, it is my business
to locate trouble.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.237
- No trouble back there.
- If you require anything...

47:03.487 --> 47:05.030
Monsieur, all I require...

47:05.239 --> 47:09.868
is a phone, my little bag of tools
and some privacy in which to work.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.162
That is all I require.

48:04.464 --> 48:07.217
Take that phone,
but don't pick it up until I tell you.

49:04.524 --> 49:08.278
- <i>Raymond?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

49:10.030 --> 49:14.826
<i>I'm taking the 5.00 plane
to Switzerland, have you got that?</i>

49:15.035 --> 49:17.245
<i>Si, Switzerland.</i>

49:17.454 --> 49:19.539
Have you got the merchandise?

49:19.873 --> 49:22.125
- <i>Si.</i>
- Good.

49:22.375 --> 49:27.714
I'll see you tomorrow
at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad.

49:28.048 --> 49:29.174
Si.

49:29.382 --> 49:33.345
- Goodbye.
- Si. Goodbye.

49:51.238 --> 49:52.572
Inspector?

49:52.822 --> 49:53.823
Do not come in!

49:53.990 --> 49:55.075
Do not come in,

49:55.242 --> 49:58.453
I am making further
delicate adjustments to the phone.

49:59.162 --> 50:01.623
I will tell you
when it is safe to enter.

50:08.421 --> 50:11.716
These adjustments must
not be interfered with, you know.

50:38.868 --> 50:41.955
Do not come in,
I am just putting my tools away.

51:05.311 --> 51:10.942
As I surmised, a slight malfunction
with your phone which I repaired.

51:13.153 --> 51:18.408
Well, I must now return to
my office and report my adjustments.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.030
According to the authorities in Nice,

51:57.280 --> 52:00.200
he has so far demolished
one swimming pool and two trucks.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.452
And he's on his way to Gstaad.

52:02.702 --> 52:04.829
- Gstaad?
- Yes.

52:05.038 --> 52:09.834
Today, a paradise in the Swiss Alps,
tomorrow, a wasteland.

52:11.961 --> 52:13.838
Compared to Clouseau,

52:14.047 --> 52:17.550
Attila the Hun
was a Red Cross volunteer.

52:22.055 --> 52:24.807
- Careful!
- Huh?

52:25.058 --> 52:27.435
I put the real one in the bottom drawer.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.562
See?

52:55.922 --> 52:58.466
Oh! Ooh!

53:24.284 --> 53:26.119
Follow that car!

53:48.725 --> 53:50.101
Good day.

53:51.894 --> 53:54.147
- So nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.

53:58.318 --> 54:00.862
Excuse me, do you know
the way to the Palace Hotel?

54:01.070 --> 54:02.155
Yes.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.643
- Bags, sir?
- No, thank you.

54:33.686 --> 54:35.730
This bag never leaves my arm.

55:27.740 --> 55:29.659
Your bag, sir.

55:31.494 --> 55:33.496
Thank you.

55:35.748 --> 55:38.459
<i>Scusi, signor.</i> May I take your coat?

55:39.418 --> 55:41.379
Thank you very much.

55:43.756 --> 55:46.259
- Your gloves?
- Of course.

55:48.261 --> 55:50.471
Your hat?

55:50.680 --> 55:53.516
<i>- Grazie, signor.</i>
<i>- Prego.</i>

56:16.205 --> 56:18.124
<i>Oui, Monsieur?</i>

56:18.374 --> 56:20.876
- Do you have a reum?
- A "reum"?

56:21.127 --> 56:24.046
- What?
- You said, do I have a "reum"?

56:24.297 --> 56:26.382
I know perfectly well what I said.

56:26.632 --> 56:28.050
I said, "Do you have a reum?"

56:29.468 --> 56:31.387
You mean, "Do I have a room?"

56:31.637 --> 56:33.681
That is what
I have been saying, you fool.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.309
Do you have a reservation?

56:41.564 --> 56:44.358
I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté...

56:45.568 --> 56:48.237
and I am here
on official police business.

56:48.404 --> 56:51.324
Whether you're here on
official police business or not,

56:51.574 --> 56:54.785
this is the height of the season
and the hotel is full!

56:55.745 --> 56:56.746
Listen, my friend.

56:56.996 --> 56:59.248
This is a matter of national importance,

56:59.498 --> 57:02.418
and if you continue
to be difficult with me

57:02.668 --> 57:06.047
I shall have no alternative
but to have speaks with my superiors.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.175
Well...

57:09.425 --> 57:11.427
In that case, monsieur...

57:12.928 --> 57:15.348
we do have a room.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.392
I thought as much.

57:27.359 --> 57:33.240
<i>Lugash Airways announce the arrival
of flight 12 from Paris and Nice.</i>

57:33.449 --> 57:37.703
<i>Passengers wishing to travel
to the city terminal by bus</i>

57:37.953 --> 57:40.623
<i>should proceed to the Lugash
transport counter.</i>

57:40.873 --> 57:43.459
The nature of your visit
to Lugash, Dr Tanny?

57:43.709 --> 57:46.545
- Is it business or pleasure?
- Purely pleasure.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.215
Next.

57:56.138 --> 58:01.102
<i>Incoming passengers are reminded
they should retain the white card.</i>

58:01.310 --> 58:05.856
<i>This must be surrendered
to Lugash authorities before departure.</i>

58:06.065 --> 58:10.236
<i>The loss of this card
may cause considerable delays.</i>

58:16.492 --> 58:18.869
Have my bags sent up to my room.

58:29.421 --> 58:30.714
How are you, Pepi?

58:32.258 --> 58:35.594
What a surprise!
It's Sir Charles Litton, isn't it?

58:35.845 --> 58:37.763
Not necessarily.

58:38.264 --> 58:40.224
<i>Un Cognac, s'il vous plaît.</i>

58:40.432 --> 58:41.725
Well...

58:42.852 --> 58:45.104
Where do I find the Fat Man?

58:45.354 --> 58:47.273
I've... I have not...

58:47.523 --> 58:49.483
I've not seen the Fat Man in years.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.068
Really?

58:55.114 --> 58:58.742
You're not working for the Fat Man,
then who are you working for?

58:59.785 --> 59:01.662
You are breaking my finger.

59:02.371 --> 59:04.331
Why don't you call a policeman?

59:05.874 --> 59:06.959
All right, all right.

59:07.209 --> 59:09.420
You can find the Fat Man
at the Salamander.

59:10.629 --> 59:12.548
Thank you, Pepi.

59:13.632 --> 59:18.345
Why don't you order yourself
some liniment... on the rocks?

01:00:32.294 --> 01:00:34.338
Well, Charles!

01:00:34.546 --> 01:00:36.965
Well, my old friend.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:39.635
It's good to see you.

01:00:40.135 --> 01:00:41.637
Come, sit down.

01:00:41.887 --> 01:00:44.973
I really miss seeing you.
You look wonderful.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:46.850
What can I do for you?

01:00:47.059 --> 01:00:50.437
Well...
I need a favour from you, old man.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:51.730
Of course.

01:00:51.897 --> 01:00:54.024
But first, I need your help.

01:00:54.399 --> 01:00:58.487
And my two associates,
they're here to guard the Pink Panther.

01:00:58.737 --> 01:01:00.447
When you've finished your drink,

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.866
- you'll hand it over.
- I haven't got it.

01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:05.661
But you took it.

01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:09.039
I wish I had, truly.
But I didn't, I swear it.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.959
Normally, Charles,
I'm a man who detests violence,

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:15.796
but in your case I'm forced to make
a most regrettable exception.

01:01:16.004 --> 01:01:18.173
Would it upset you too much
to explain why?

01:01:18.423 --> 01:01:21.009
Under the pretence
of trying to catch the thief,

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.762
the general is hurting
many innocent people...

01:01:24.513 --> 01:01:26.598
and a group of my very good friends.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.643
If I give him the thief,
he'll have to stop hurting them.

01:01:30.769 --> 01:01:33.021
Of course,
if you didn't steal the Panther,

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.357
one might almost conclude the general,

01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:37.860
in order to get rid of
his political enemies,

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:40.404
engineered the robbery himself.

01:01:40.612 --> 01:01:42.781
I bet he even offered a reward.

01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:46.326
- A very considerable reward, dead...
- Or alive?

01:01:46.535 --> 01:01:47.995
And if you are dead...

01:01:48.203 --> 01:01:51.373
I can't prove
I didn't steal the Pink Panther.

01:01:51.623 --> 01:01:53.250
I knew you would figure it out.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:56.503
Deliver the body to the general
with my compliments.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:02:00.424
I'm awfully sorry... old boy.

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:04.261
Well, you know the old saying,

01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:06.013
"With friends like you,

01:02:06.221 --> 01:02:07.931
- who needs enemies?"
- Enemies.

01:03:39.564 --> 01:03:41.400
Good evening, Dr Tanny.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:42.984
Good evening.

01:03:43.235 --> 01:03:45.362
I am Colonel Sharki.

01:03:46.655 --> 01:03:50.283
Yes! I thought we might be
running into one another...

01:03:50.742 --> 01:03:52.452
sooner or later.

01:03:53.495 --> 01:03:57.457
I... I need your help.

01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:01.169
Now, Colonel Sharki...

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:04.798
What could a simple doctor do

01:04:05.006 --> 01:04:08.176
to help the head
of the Lugash secret police?

01:04:08.426 --> 01:04:10.554
A simple doctor? Nothing.

01:04:10.762 --> 01:04:13.807
But the notorious Phantom?

01:04:14.015 --> 01:04:16.852
Oh, he could do quite a bit.

01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:18.436
For instance?

01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:23.817
<i>I want your cooperation
in recovering the Pink Panther.</i>

01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:27.404
The Fat Man seems to think
that you cooked up this robbery

01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:31.449
as an excuse to do
a little political housecleaning.

01:04:33.785 --> 01:04:37.289
The Fat Man is not
the only one with that opinion.

01:04:38.123 --> 01:04:40.834
And if you can prove
that you are not guilty...

01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:43.962
- You have a bad leg?
- Oh, it's nothing.

01:04:44.212 --> 01:04:47.257
If you can prove you're not guilty,
I'm in serious trouble.

01:04:47.966 --> 01:04:51.011
Because of the religious significance
of the Pink Panther,

01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:53.013
it's imperative to the government

01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:55.682
that sooner or later
the thief be apprehended,

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:59.477
- and the jewel returned.
- You would prefer it later than sooner?

01:05:01.146 --> 01:05:03.023
I can't tell you how reassuring it is

01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:05.775
to know that we
understand each other so well.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:07.903
And if...

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:09.988
I do...

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.699
catch the thief?

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:16.578
I have every confidence that you will.

01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:18.747
How does the saying go?

01:05:20.415 --> 01:05:24.127
"Set a thief to catch a thief."

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:27.923
Goodnight, Dr Tanny.

01:06:07.128 --> 01:06:10.131
- You hate him.
- Yes, I hate him all right.

01:06:10.382 --> 01:06:12.676
- How much do you hate him?
- How much?

01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:14.302
How high is up?

01:06:14.552 --> 01:06:17.013
I hate every little
molecule in his body.

01:06:17.222 --> 01:06:18.390
You'd like to kill him?

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.394
To kill him. Oh, God, yes. To kill him.

01:06:23.228 --> 01:06:24.646
Why don't you?

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:26.731
Oh, to kill him.

01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:29.359
What? Why don't I?

01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:32.487
- It's not so easy, you try.
- I mean kill him psychically.

01:06:32.737 --> 01:06:33.988
- Ridiculous.
- Why?

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:36.533
Nothing I can do psychically would have

01:06:36.741 --> 01:06:38.952
- the slightest effect on him.
- Why not?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.329
Because he's got the brain of a minkey.

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:43.790
- Minkey?
- What?

01:06:43.998 --> 01:06:48.128
- You said minkey.
- I did?

01:06:48.336 --> 01:06:50.380
You see, I'm beginning to talk like him.

01:06:50.588 --> 01:06:53.550
Now doctor, you'd better come up
with a better suggestion

01:06:53.758 --> 01:06:55.677
or I'll get myself another analyst.

01:06:55.927 --> 01:06:57.846
Now, just relax.

01:06:58.096 --> 01:07:00.140
Relax.

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:02.642
I haven't slept for a week.

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:07.772
I just lie there thinking the same
thoughts over and over and over again.

01:07:08.022 --> 01:07:12.652
Describe your thoughts. Get them out
in the open and you'll feel much better.

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:14.446
All right.

01:07:14.696 --> 01:07:16.156
See, it's always the same.

01:07:16.364 --> 01:07:18.158
Clouseau is sitting there,

01:07:18.366 --> 01:07:21.327
in a chair just like you,
with his back to me.

01:07:22.287 --> 01:07:23.913
And then suddenly,

01:07:24.122 --> 01:07:28.460
my hands go round his throat
and I begin to squeeze.

01:07:29.544 --> 01:07:33.506
It's wonderful, it's marvellous.
I'm squeezing.

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:37.552
And the more I squeeze,
the freer I feel.

01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:41.472
I'm in ecstasy.

01:07:41.723 --> 01:07:43.850
And then suddenly...

01:07:44.058 --> 01:07:47.270
Suddenly, my problem is solved.

01:07:48.646 --> 01:07:49.856
Doctor?

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:51.232
Doctor!

01:07:51.983 --> 01:07:54.903
Sir Charles arrived
at my office this morning at ten,

01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:57.238
and we reviewed
all the evidence to date.

01:07:57.488 --> 01:08:00.283
He was interested,
asked all the right questions.

01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:02.452
Then we went to the viewing room

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.622
and watched the film
from the hidden monitoring cameras.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:09.500
This was the last group to go through
the museum before it was robbed.

01:08:10.084 --> 01:08:12.879
- Do you recognise any of these people?
- No.

01:08:13.087 --> 01:08:14.172
No.

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:16.633
He appeared to
study the film very carefully,

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:19.551
and he claimed not
to recognise any one of them.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:20.845
No.

01:08:21.011 --> 01:08:23.221
We questioned him three times
about each.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.515
No.

01:08:24.682 --> 01:08:26.600
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:29.228
- This one?
- No.

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:32.649
- How about that one?
- No!

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:35.151
Each time the results were identical.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.321
Little or no stress until
questioned about number three.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.697
Then, hard stress.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.240
Number three.

01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:44.035
A young man,
the museum guide remembers him.

01:09:12.397 --> 01:09:13.939
Good morning.

01:09:14.564 --> 01:09:16.234
It could be better.

01:09:16.651 --> 01:09:19.654
- How?
- You could go away.

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:22.698
All right,
but first I'll need your truck.

01:09:22.907 --> 01:09:25.033
I haven't got a truck anymore.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.787
I sold it.

01:09:30.415 --> 01:09:32.291
What do you want it for?

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.919
You're gonna help me
get across the border.

01:09:35.169 --> 01:09:39.381
It's impossible, the border is closed.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.259
You have to have a special pass.

01:09:41.509 --> 01:09:44.470
- Then get one.
- It's out of the question.

01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:47.515
If I go to the Fat Man
to buy a special pass,

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:50.184
he wants to know the reason.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.729
Then tell him
that I've threatened your life

01:09:52.937 --> 01:09:55.189
unless you help me
to get across the border.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.109
Tell him that for
half the sum of the reward

01:09:58.276 --> 01:10:01.279
plus a forged pass
to get you out of the country,

01:10:01.529 --> 01:10:05.116
you will deliver me into an ambush
at some pre-named place

01:10:05.366 --> 01:10:08.703
of the Fat Man's choosing,
this side of the border.

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.622
What if he doesn't believe me?

01:10:11.873 --> 01:10:14.041
I'm sure you'll be able to convince him.

01:10:15.293 --> 01:10:19.130
And if, my dear Pepi,
you double-cross me,

01:10:19.797 --> 01:10:23.426
it'll be a very long while before
you give your next piano recital.

01:10:40.234 --> 01:10:41.319
Yes?

01:10:41.486 --> 01:10:44.530
You asked to be kept informed
of Lady Litton's activities.

01:10:44.739 --> 01:10:46.949
- Yes.
- She's going skiing at two.

01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:50.495
- Skiing in this weather?
- On the glacier.

01:10:50.745 --> 01:10:52.205
On the glacier?

01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:57.376
- How long have you been a bellboy?
- Oh! Too long, monsieur.

01:10:57.585 --> 01:11:00.129
Keep up this good work
and very soon I will see to it

01:11:00.338 --> 01:11:03.007
that you become a bell man.

01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:17.396
- <i>Bonjour,</i> milady.
- Hello, good afternoon.

01:11:17.605 --> 01:11:21.400
I changed my mind about skiing. I'm
going to the tennis matches instead.

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:24.820
If my husband calls
tell him I'll be back around four.

01:11:25.071 --> 01:11:26.822
- <i>Oui, madame.</i>
- Thank you.

01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:38.626
Hello?

01:11:38.876 --> 01:11:41.087
<i>Guten Tag?</i>

01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:15.329
- Hello? <i>Wie geht's?</i>
- <i>Wie geht's?</i>

01:15:24.184 --> 01:15:28.689
Swine bird, that is my private
moustache. You naughty bird.

01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:34.653
Swine!

01:19:02.152 --> 01:19:03.195
No, no, no, wait!

01:19:03.361 --> 01:19:05.614
It's me,
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.

01:19:05.822 --> 01:19:06.990
- She's coming.
- What?

01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:08.408
In the elevator.

01:19:41.441 --> 01:19:42.651
Hello.

01:20:46.256 --> 01:20:48.800
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

01:20:49.092 --> 01:20:50.844
What we are doing...

01:20:56.891 --> 01:20:58.476
She's coming!

01:21:04.733 --> 01:21:06.484
I'm sorry.

01:21:10.655 --> 01:21:12.365
Oh, come in, please.

01:21:15.618 --> 01:21:19.622
- Some towels you have, <i>bitte?</i>
- Oh, yes. I'll go get them.

01:22:42.163 --> 01:22:48.086
- What are you doing?
- <i>Nichts. Staubsucker.</i>

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.009
Out! <i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:24.289
Get up, you fool!

01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:28.418
<i>Guten Tag! Wie geht's?</i>

01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:49.939
What took you so long?

01:23:50.148 --> 01:23:53.067
The Fat Man is not convinced so easily.

01:23:53.276 --> 01:23:56.529
- But you managed.
- Here is the pass.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.575
And you gave him...

01:24:01.242 --> 01:24:02.744
As you suggested.

01:24:02.952 --> 01:24:06.873
For the pass and half of the reward,
I will hand you over.

01:24:07.081 --> 01:24:09.792
- Quickly, we must hurry.
- Where?

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:13.046
- What?
- Where did you agree to hand me over?

01:24:13.254 --> 01:24:15.298
The Fat Man will be waiting at the point

01:24:15.506 --> 01:24:19.010
one mile south of the roadway,
seven miles from the border.

01:24:19.218 --> 01:24:21.721
I know the place precisely.

01:24:21.929 --> 01:24:25.058
I will avoid it absolutely.
Quick, we must hurry!

01:24:27.518 --> 01:24:28.561
No, after you.

01:24:29.187 --> 01:24:30.688
- What?
- Try "why."

01:24:30.897 --> 01:24:33.232
- Why?
- Shh!

01:24:33.441 --> 01:24:37.362
Because I know you precisely,
and doubt you absolutely.

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.281
Sir Charles... Please, please!
Sir Charles...

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:44.577
Don't worry, as long as you've told the
truth, there's nothing to worry about.

01:24:44.786 --> 01:24:46.913
Nothing to worry about.

01:24:47.121 --> 01:24:48.331
All right?

01:24:48.539 --> 01:24:51.209
- Be careful.
- Thank you very much.

01:26:46.449 --> 01:26:48.409
Open it.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.080
Be careful.

01:26:57.543 --> 01:26:59.503
He tricked me!

01:27:37.917 --> 01:27:40.002
From the gentleman at the bar, madam.

01:28:18.207 --> 01:28:19.834
Good evening.

01:28:20.543 --> 01:28:22.503
Good evening.

01:28:23.504 --> 01:28:26.966
Monsieur Guy Gadbois, at your service.

01:28:27.925 --> 01:28:30.636
- How do you do? I'm Lady Litton.
- Yes, I know.

01:28:30.845 --> 01:28:33.597
- Oh.
- I took the liberty of finding out.

01:28:33.806 --> 01:28:35.266
I hope you are not offended.

01:28:35.474 --> 01:28:37.810
That depends on your intentions.

01:28:38.018 --> 01:28:40.521
Strictly honourable, I can assure you.

01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:43.065
A man sees a beautiful chicken,

01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:46.068
he can't help but be inquisitive,
you know?

01:28:47.736 --> 01:28:50.906
Would you think it naughty of me
if I offered to buy you a drink?

01:28:51.115 --> 01:28:52.575
But you already have.

01:28:56.996 --> 01:29:00.291
How about I buy myself one,
and we'll drink it together?

01:29:00.499 --> 01:29:02.209
All right.

01:29:04.795 --> 01:29:05.963
Waiter...

01:29:06.172 --> 01:29:09.383
another Kahlúa and ginger ale, please.

01:29:12.303 --> 01:29:13.721
Well...

01:29:14.513 --> 01:29:19.101
If there is a Lady Litton,
there must be a lord.

01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:21.353
- What?
- Lord Litton.

01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:24.523
- Yes, he's in...
- Yes?

01:29:25.191 --> 01:29:27.902
- ...plastics.
- Oh, the plastic.

01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:30.154
- In...
- Yes?

01:29:30.362 --> 01:29:32.698
Industrial plastics.

01:29:33.949 --> 01:29:35.618
Very interesting.

01:29:44.084 --> 01:29:45.336
Well...

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:50.090
Here is looking at you, kid.

01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.820
You have anything to declare?

01:30:12.029 --> 01:30:13.948
Nothing.

01:30:14.156 --> 01:30:16.116
You may proceed.

01:30:33.425 --> 01:30:35.135
I come here very often, you know.

01:30:35.302 --> 01:30:37.304
I come here for the winter sports,

01:30:37.513 --> 01:30:39.473
- for the skiing.
- So do I.

01:30:39.682 --> 01:30:41.475
Why have we never met?

01:30:41.684 --> 01:30:43.644
Well, it's quite simple, really.

01:30:43.852 --> 01:30:47.147
I get up at the crack of dawn...
I'm so terribly sorry about that.

01:30:47.356 --> 01:30:49.650
I get up at the crack of dawn, always.

01:30:49.858 --> 01:30:52.486
Up the mountain,
down the slopes on the piste.

01:30:52.695 --> 01:30:54.655
You must be a very good skier.

01:30:55.155 --> 01:30:59.118
Well, I started when I was
a mere babe in arms.

01:30:59.326 --> 01:31:01.995
I could ski before I could even crawl.

01:31:04.164 --> 01:31:07.209
I'm terribly sorry, I beg your pardon.

01:31:07.418 --> 01:31:08.919
It's all right.

01:31:09.128 --> 01:31:12.047
This hotel is deteriorating rapidly.

01:31:12.923 --> 01:31:14.049
Well...

01:31:14.258 --> 01:31:16.760
Here's to you, Monsieur Gadbois.

01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:22.266
Is that your own parrot?

01:31:22.474 --> 01:31:25.060
- No, it comes with the hotel.
- Does it?

01:31:25.519 --> 01:31:28.355
Someone let it out of its cage,
and I can't get it back in.

01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:32.276
- You need another glass.
- I most certainly do.

01:31:33.193 --> 01:31:35.154
Swine parrot.

01:31:35.362 --> 01:31:37.698
What is it you do, Monsieur Gadbois?

01:31:38.782 --> 01:31:42.578
Well, you know, I do a little bit
of this and a little bit of that.

01:31:42.786 --> 01:31:44.913
A man of mystery.

01:31:45.122 --> 01:31:46.790
One might say that, yes.

01:31:46.999 --> 01:31:48.750
I would, of course, tell you more.

01:31:48.959 --> 01:31:51.920
But it would be
safer for you if I did not.

01:31:53.922 --> 01:31:56.216
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

01:31:56.425 --> 01:31:58.302
Yes?

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.223
Excuse me, for moment
I thought I was in your apartment.

01:32:05.058 --> 01:32:07.394
- Hello?
- I am in your apartment.

01:32:07.769 --> 01:32:10.314
- It's for you.
- For me?

01:32:15.819 --> 01:32:18.989
There is no need to leave on my account.

01:32:19.198 --> 01:32:21.533
There is need to leave on my account.

01:32:25.162 --> 01:32:29.208
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Monsieur Gadbois?

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:32.836
Yes, this is Monsieur Gadbois.
Who is that speaking?

01:32:33.545 --> 01:32:36.381
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:39.468
I'll give you a clue.
This is the man who hates you.

01:32:39.676 --> 01:32:41.845
This is the man who
more than anything else

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:43.972
would like to see you dead and buried.

01:32:44.181 --> 01:32:48.060
The headwaiter that works at the
little bistro on the rue des Beaux-Arts?

01:32:48.268 --> 01:32:50.896
No! This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

01:32:51.104 --> 01:32:52.356
<i>Idiot!</i>

01:32:53.231 --> 01:32:55.984
You understand that
anyone could call up here

01:32:56.193 --> 01:32:57.945
and ask for Monsieur Guy Gadbois

01:32:58.153 --> 01:33:00.697
and say that they were
Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

01:33:00.906 --> 01:33:02.658
What is your code name?

01:33:02.866 --> 01:33:04.201
Code name, huh?

01:33:04.409 --> 01:33:05.744
Code name?

01:33:06.161 --> 01:33:08.163
<i>I don't have a code name.</i>

01:33:08.372 --> 01:33:10.791
<i>I never had a code name, lunatic!</i>

01:33:10.999 --> 01:33:14.252
I understand that, sir,
but only the real Inspector Dreyfus

01:33:14.461 --> 01:33:16.838
would know that
he did not have a code name.

01:33:17.965 --> 01:33:21.093
Clouseau,
why are you still in Switzerland?

01:33:23.387 --> 01:33:27.057
Because I am here attempting
to interrogate Lady Litton

01:33:27.265 --> 01:33:30.394
and trying to find out
where her husband is.

01:33:30.894 --> 01:33:32.270
Her husband is in Lugash.

01:33:32.479 --> 01:33:34.231
He's been there since Tuesday.

01:33:34.439 --> 01:33:37.526
Well, in that case, I will leave
on the next available plane.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.446
Yes, sir, yes. Quite, quite.

01:33:41.655 --> 01:33:45.534
I quite understand what you mean,
and I'm not arguing with you about that.

01:33:45.742 --> 01:33:48.370
That would be my advice, as well.
Yes, absolutely.

01:33:48.578 --> 01:33:49.913
But...

01:33:51.164 --> 01:33:55.085
Yes, I can understand your feelings
under the circumstances. Absolutely.

01:33:55.293 --> 01:33:57.003
Yes, that is quite right.

01:33:57.212 --> 01:34:00.340
But I must say to you, sir,
whatever your feelings are,

01:34:00.549 --> 01:34:04.177
you must not call me here
at any hour of the night or day.

01:34:04.386 --> 01:34:06.388
Even in an emergency.

01:34:07.639 --> 01:34:09.808
A little bit of this
and a little bit of that

01:34:10.016 --> 01:34:11.268
add up sometimes.

01:34:11.476 --> 01:34:12.519
Thank you.

01:34:12.686 --> 01:34:15.856
Did I understand you to say
you were leaving on the next plane?

01:34:16.064 --> 01:34:17.357
Regrettably, yes, yes.

01:34:17.566 --> 01:34:19.735
One of life's little tragedies,
you know.

01:34:19.943 --> 01:34:23.196
- Aw!
- So until we meet again...

01:34:24.781 --> 01:34:26.158
I will say...

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.161
here is looking at you, kid.

01:34:35.417 --> 01:34:37.419
Is anything the matter?

01:34:38.378 --> 01:34:40.213
Yeah.

01:34:40.422 --> 01:34:42.174
Strange taste.

01:34:42.507 --> 01:34:44.009
Well...

01:34:45.218 --> 01:34:47.179
- <i>au revoir.</i>
- <i>Au revoir.</i>

01:34:59.566 --> 01:35:01.568
The concierge, please.

01:35:57.874 --> 01:36:00.252
Monsieur Gadbois' room.

01:36:32.826 --> 01:36:34.202
Oh, no.

01:37:33.052 --> 01:37:34.095
Yes?

01:37:34.262 --> 01:37:35.930
Clouseau.

01:37:36.139 --> 01:37:40.101
Since you have seen fit to disregard
my orders and remain in Switzerland...

01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:41.352
<i>Don't interrupt!</i>

01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:43.772
I want you to arrest Lady Litton!

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.815
Arrest the Lady Litton?

01:37:46.024 --> 01:37:47.484
Immediately!

01:37:47.692 --> 01:37:50.236
If she is not in your custody
within five minutes,

01:37:50.445 --> 01:37:53.531
you'll be checking
parking meters in Martinique.

01:37:54.657 --> 01:37:56.618
Yes, sir.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.456
Five minutes!

01:38:04.125 --> 01:38:06.794
No, Cato, you fool,
this is not the time.

01:38:07.003 --> 01:38:09.672
This is not the time, Cato!

01:38:10.924 --> 01:38:13.092
Come out of there, come out of there!

01:38:13.301 --> 01:38:15.261
This is the time!

01:38:16.638 --> 01:38:18.598
You stupid fool, you see what you did?

01:38:18.806 --> 01:38:21.351
You forgot the first rule
of self-defence.

01:38:21.559 --> 01:38:23.394
Never be taken by surprise!

01:38:23.603 --> 01:38:26.648
I didn't expect to see you
out of hospital so soon.

01:38:26.856 --> 01:38:28.858
My brown suit. Give me the valet.

01:38:29.067 --> 01:38:32.237
They did an excellent job
of restoration on your yellow skin.

01:38:32.445 --> 01:38:36.616
Valet, this is Inspector Clouseau.
Please send up my brown...

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.411
Well, please send down
my brown suit immediately.

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.830
I cannot wait.
As quick as you possibly can!

01:38:43.039 --> 01:38:44.332
Quicker, please!

01:38:45.166 --> 01:38:47.835
I can't wait for them.
Help me get dressed.

01:38:48.586 --> 01:38:50.505
I have to go and arrest Lady Litton.

01:38:50.713 --> 01:38:53.258
Arrest Lady Litton, be sure,
but on what charge?

01:38:53.466 --> 01:38:54.509
Hello, hello!

01:38:54.676 --> 01:38:58.137
This is Inspector Clouseau.
Please connect me with Paris, France.

01:38:58.346 --> 01:38:59.847
Trocadero-3-7-1...

01:39:04.727 --> 01:39:05.812
Hello, <i>oui.</i>

01:39:06.312 --> 01:39:07.480
What?

01:39:07.689 --> 01:39:08.940
Who?

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.777
Yes, yes, OK. I'll accept it.

01:39:15.488 --> 01:39:16.698
Hello, Clouseau.

01:39:16.906 --> 01:39:18.825
No, he's not here.

01:39:19.033 --> 01:39:21.202
On vacation.
He won't be back for a week.

01:39:21.411 --> 01:39:22.495
I just spoke with him.

01:39:22.704 --> 01:39:25.415
He instructed me to arrest
Lady Litton immediately.

01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:26.833
What?

01:39:27.041 --> 01:39:28.334
Yes!

01:39:28.543 --> 01:39:30.586
That's very easy for you to say.

01:39:30.795 --> 01:39:33.256
I would be delighted to arrest her, yes!

01:39:33.464 --> 01:39:34.507
On what charge?

01:39:34.716 --> 01:39:37.176
It could be embarrassing
if I go to her and say,

01:39:37.385 --> 01:39:39.303
"I arrest you in the name of the law."

01:39:39.512 --> 01:39:42.098
She says "On what charge?"
I do not have the answer.

01:39:42.306 --> 01:39:43.349
What?

01:39:43.558 --> 01:39:44.934
Oh, yes!

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.520
And the same to you!

01:39:47.854 --> 01:39:49.814
Filthy swine.

01:39:51.232 --> 01:39:53.151
Cato, very strange.

01:39:53.359 --> 01:39:55.236
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calls me,

01:39:55.445 --> 01:39:59.615
tells me to arrest Lady Litton,
immediately, without a charge

01:39:59.824 --> 01:40:02.118
I call him back,
I find he's not in his office.

01:40:02.326 --> 01:40:05.955
Even stranger,
I find he's gone away on vacation.

01:40:06.622 --> 01:40:10.668
Cato, things are very fishy in Denmark.

01:40:10.877 --> 01:40:13.671
- Switzerland.
- Yes, there too.

01:40:22.638 --> 01:40:26.100
No more. No more, I've had enough.

01:40:26.309 --> 01:40:29.312
This time it ends
with a bullet in his brain.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.688
Brain.

01:40:36.861 --> 01:40:38.988
<i>- Bonjour...</i>
- Shh.

01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:45.036
<i>Merci.</i>

01:41:12.063 --> 01:41:14.690
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

01:41:14.899 --> 01:41:16.359
Breakfast.

01:41:16.567 --> 01:41:17.693
<i>Voilà.</i>

01:41:17.902 --> 01:41:20.988
Just leave it over there.
I'll sign for it later.

01:41:27.703 --> 01:41:30.831
How about a little tip?

01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:34.919
Charles, darling.

01:41:36.587 --> 01:41:38.714
All right, all right.

01:41:38.923 --> 01:41:40.424
Now where is it?

01:41:40.633 --> 01:41:43.553
After all these years, you need to ask?

01:41:43.761 --> 01:41:44.887
I'm quite serious.

01:41:45.096 --> 01:41:48.849
Oh, I hope so. You hotel waiters
lead such interesting lives.

01:41:49.058 --> 01:41:53.354
No, no, no, no, no. Not now, darling.
Not now. Please, now, where is it?

01:41:54.105 --> 01:41:56.232
That depends on what you're looking for.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.695
Now, come on, Claudine. Please, not now.
Where is it? I'm losing patience.

01:42:00.903 --> 01:42:04.574
I shall ask the hotel
to send up another waiter.

01:42:04.782 --> 01:42:09.412
I should like very much if you would
hand me over the Pink Panther,

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.581
if it is not too much trouble.

01:42:15.418 --> 01:42:17.753
How did you find out so quickly?

01:42:17.962 --> 01:42:19.630
Feminine intuition.

01:42:19.839 --> 01:42:24.927
I thought it would take you
at least another week.

01:42:25.136 --> 01:42:28.681
You know, you are
very good at what you do.

01:42:28.889 --> 01:42:30.766
Thank you.

01:42:30.975 --> 01:42:35.396
I was prepared to surrender my body
to Clouseau if it was necessary.

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.441
Why did you do it?

01:42:38.649 --> 01:42:42.778
I didn't. I said I was prepared to.

01:42:42.987 --> 01:42:45.448
Aren't you a little bit proud of me?

01:42:45.656 --> 01:42:47.533
You nearly had me killed, you know.

01:42:47.742 --> 01:42:52.121
- It's better than dying of boredom.
- Me? Bored with you?

01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:54.290
I'm sorry, darling.

01:42:54.498 --> 01:42:59.795
It's just that I never realised
how tedious life could be

01:43:00.004 --> 01:43:03.257
for a retired jewel thief. Yuck.

01:43:08.137 --> 01:43:09.972
Clever little beast.

01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:13.642
Better than a hotel safe.

01:43:18.481 --> 01:43:20.775
Now tell me,

01:43:20.983 --> 01:43:24.236
how did you find out it was me?

01:43:24.445 --> 01:43:29.658
Well, there's something about a wife
even with a beard.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.497
Now, come on, darling.

01:43:34.705 --> 01:43:38.167
It's time to get dressed,
pack and go home.

01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:40.503
Now, come on, darling...

01:43:42.171 --> 01:43:46.258
Forgive the intrusion, madam, but you
see before you a very disillusioned man.

01:43:46.467 --> 01:43:48.969
Disillusioned and with a gun.

01:43:49.178 --> 01:43:51.263
- He's obviously not with the hotel.
- No.

01:43:51.472 --> 01:43:55.392
Allow me to introduce Colonel Sharki
of the Lugash Secret Police.

01:43:55.601 --> 01:43:57.019
That explains the gun.

01:43:57.228 --> 01:44:01.106
I foolishly believed that your husband
was a man of integrity.

01:44:01.315 --> 01:44:02.983
- That was foolish.
- Thank you.

01:44:03.192 --> 01:44:07.822
You see, your husband and I,
we had an arrangement.

01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:11.492
He was to do certain things,
and if he didn't...

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.662
You were to do certain things.

01:44:15.538 --> 01:44:16.789
Regrettably.

01:44:16.997 --> 01:44:21.210
Coffee, darling. I'm sorry,
there's only one cup.

01:44:21.418 --> 01:44:25.589
I know I'm going
to be sorry I asked this,

01:44:25.798 --> 01:44:27.591
but want to give me a for instance?

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.302
First, you will hand over
the Pink Panther.

01:44:30.928 --> 01:44:32.137
And second?

01:44:32.346 --> 01:44:34.098
I will be forced to shoot you.

01:44:34.306 --> 01:44:35.349
Who's forcing you?

01:44:39.687 --> 01:44:42.398
Open the door in the name of the law.

01:44:42.606 --> 01:44:45.859
Would you please, sir, answer the door?

01:44:46.068 --> 01:44:47.945
Excuse me, darling.

01:44:48.153 --> 01:44:52.116
Lady Litton, I am forced to arrest you!

01:44:52.324 --> 01:44:54.076
And if you do not open this door,

01:44:54.285 --> 01:44:57.246
I will have no alternative
but to break it down.

01:44:57.621 --> 01:44:58.998
Very well.

01:45:08.007 --> 01:45:10.217
Guy, you're all wet!

01:45:10.426 --> 01:45:12.511
There's a defect in my plumbing.

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.097
Lady Litton, listen to me.

01:45:15.889 --> 01:45:18.225
I have deceived you.

01:45:18.434 --> 01:45:22.396
I am not Guy Gadbois. I am
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté,

01:45:22.605 --> 01:45:24.940
and it is my painful duty to arrest you.

01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:26.358
Do you know my husband?

01:45:26.567 --> 01:45:29.069
I must confess I do.
I met him several years ago.

01:45:29.278 --> 01:45:31.947
When I meet him again,
I'll arrest him immediately.

01:45:32.156 --> 01:45:34.116
Then you must have met Colonel Sharki.

01:45:34.325 --> 01:45:38.203
That idiot from the Secret Police.
Yes, I know him. And when I...

01:45:39.496 --> 01:45:42.291
Sir Charles Litton,
I arrest you in the name of the law,

01:45:42.499 --> 01:45:44.877
and I warn you that
anything you say will be...

01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:49.882
Before you get all worked up,
there's something you must know.

01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:52.426
He intends to kill all of us.

01:45:52.634 --> 01:45:54.887
- Who?
- Colonel Sharki.

01:45:58.932 --> 01:46:03.270
Good Sharki Colonel God,
we were just talking about you.

01:46:03.479 --> 01:46:06.273
As you can see,
I've got the whole case buttoned up.

01:46:06.482 --> 01:46:07.816
Everything is sewn up.

01:46:08.025 --> 01:46:10.736
This is Sir Charles Phantom,
the famous Pink Litton.

01:46:10.944 --> 01:46:12.905
Who stole the...

01:46:13.572 --> 01:46:15.616
What did you say?
He was going to kill us?

01:46:15.824 --> 01:46:18.452
Well, if you can persuade him
to change his mind...

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.871
- You're joking, of course.
- No.

01:46:22.706 --> 01:46:26.168
- You're going to kill me, as well?
- With pleasure.

01:46:27.336 --> 01:46:30.506
Is there anything I can do that
will make you change your mind?

01:46:30.714 --> 01:46:34.009
Well, there's nothing
that I can think of.

01:46:34.968 --> 01:46:37.346
Supposing that I thought of something.

01:46:37.554 --> 01:46:42.851
- Hmm. For instance?
- Well...

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:49.066
For instance, supposing
I told you that your fly was undone?

01:46:50.067 --> 01:46:54.154
By a remarkable coincidence,
so is yours.

01:46:54.363 --> 01:46:57.366
Oh, no. Not again.

01:46:58.617 --> 01:47:03.163
Ah! I see you are familiar
with the "open fly" ploy.

01:47:03.372 --> 01:47:05.332
Well, so am I.

01:47:06.208 --> 01:47:10.671
You also know the "falling on the bed
with the arm on the floor" ploy.

01:47:10.879 --> 01:47:13.799
- He's been shot dead, idiot.
- Don't call me an idiot.

01:47:14.007 --> 01:47:16.426
What? Who?

01:47:32.818 --> 01:47:34.736
Be careful, darling.

01:47:34.945 --> 01:47:37.906
He's either reloading
or out of ammunition.

01:47:39.783 --> 01:47:42.494
He's out of his mind,
that's what he's out of.

01:47:54.339 --> 01:47:56.717
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

01:47:56.925 --> 01:47:58.719
- Monsieur!
- I'll kill you!

01:48:05.434 --> 01:48:06.602
Get out of my way!

01:48:15.986 --> 01:48:18.572
Chief Inspector Dreyfus was tried

01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:21.992
and found not guilty,
by reason of insanity.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.246
Clouseau, the famous detective,
was decorated by General Wadafi.

01:48:26.455 --> 01:48:29.666
Then he went back to France,
where I believe he took over

01:48:29.875 --> 01:48:32.586
the position vacated
by the madman, Dreyfus.

01:48:33.587 --> 01:48:38.467
There it is, ladies and gentlemen,
the largest diamond in the world.

01:48:38.675 --> 01:48:44.306
And surely, the most famous,
or infamous, if you prefer.

01:48:44.765 --> 01:48:45.891
The Pink Panther.

01:48:46.099 --> 01:48:47.893
What ever happened to Sir Charles?

01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:52.064
As far as anyone knows,
he still is living the quiet life

01:48:52.272 --> 01:48:54.941
at his villa in the South of France.

01:48:55.359 --> 01:49:00.197
Although there has been a rumour that
the notorious Phantom is back at work,

01:49:00.405 --> 01:49:05.077
and although it has long been suspected
that Sir Charles and the Phantom

01:49:05.285 --> 01:49:09.498
are one and the same,
it has never been proved.

01:49:12.542 --> 01:49:13.835
Mark my words, François.

01:49:14.544 --> 01:49:16.838
Before the week is out,
I will have proof that

01:49:17.047 --> 01:49:19.383
Sir Charles Litton is the Phantom.

01:49:19.591 --> 01:49:22.844
- Did you enjoy your food?
- Oh, yes, yes. Very nice.

01:49:23.053 --> 01:49:26.390
You've probably guessed
I have a passion for the Oriental food.

01:49:27.891 --> 01:49:30.185
Cato usually does some cooking for me,

01:49:30.394 --> 01:49:33.313
but recently he's taken to
attacking me at every chance.

01:49:33.522 --> 01:49:35.565
It's very bad for the digestion.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.280
That is very strange, François.

01:49:42.697 --> 01:49:48.286
I don't ever recall receiving the
fortune cookie in a Japanese restaurant.

01:49:48.495 --> 01:49:50.831
- What does it say?
- We shall see...

01:49:54.626 --> 01:50:00.423
"Beware of Japanese waitress
bearing fortune cookies."

01:50:01.883 --> 01:50:04.094
Japanese waitress?

01:50:10.934 --> 01:50:12.894
Cato, get off!

01:50:14.396 --> 01:50:15.522
Cato!

01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:17.691
No, you idiot!

01:50:23.113 --> 01:50:25.448
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I beg your...

01:50:36.459 --> 01:50:38.503
Stop, Cato! Enough, enough!

01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:41.047
Enough, I say!

01:50:41.256 --> 01:50:43.884
Get your hands off of me!

01:50:44.634 --> 01:50:47.053
You must remember
my new position in the force!

01:50:47.262 --> 01:50:50.348
You have devastated
my sukiyaki in there.

01:50:50.724 --> 01:50:53.560
You fool! You raving Oriental idiot!

01:50:53.852 --> 01:50:56.897
There is a time and a place
for everything, Cato!

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.482
And this is it.

01:51:47.238 --> 01:51:49.282
Kill him! Kill him!
