WEBVTT

00:02.047 --> 00:06.084
You lose,
we don't merge.

00:06.168 --> 00:08.135
You win,
you get what you want.

00:08.203 --> 00:10.088
You lose,
you stay.

00:10.172 --> 00:12.306
You extend
your noncompete,

00:12.374 --> 00:16.010
and you get a chance to earn
your name on the door,

00:16.061 --> 00:18.045
because it's not
going up there now.

00:18.097 --> 00:19.380
There's no room
for both of us.

00:19.431 --> 00:22.717
Unless we made room
for each other.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.435
I put him on the list,
and I handed it in.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.438
He didn't put you
on his list.

00:27.523 --> 00:28.906
- I won't.
- You will.

00:28.991 --> 00:30.191
Harvey will never
forgive me.

00:30.242 --> 00:31.882
This is a letter
to the district attorney,

00:31.910 --> 00:35.363
saying that you
are breaking the law.

00:35.414 --> 00:38.916
You file your motion,

00:39.001 --> 00:40.368
I'll file mine.

00:40.419 --> 00:41.502
You weren't there.

00:41.570 --> 00:42.891
- I didn't have to be.
- Jessica--

00:42.904 --> 00:44.455
You don't work for Jessica.
You work for me.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.241
You're fired.
No, he's not.

00:47.292 --> 00:48.926
You could've just told me
that you didn't love me

00:49.011 --> 00:50.578
instead of selling me out.

00:50.629 --> 00:52.513
I didn't sell you out,
Scottie.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.298
I just got fired.

00:54.383 --> 00:55.800
Whatever she did,

00:55.884 --> 00:57.524
you wouldn't have this merger
without her.

00:57.586 --> 01:00.521
Would you have her work here
or in London?

01:00.589 --> 01:02.590
You're going
to stay here,

01:02.641 --> 01:04.775
be humble,

01:04.860 --> 01:06.694
and learn
your goddamn place.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.230
I never went
to Harvard.

01:09.281 --> 01:10.231
What?

01:10.282 --> 01:13.067
I'm a fraud.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.105 --> 01:51.138
Hey.

01:51.190 --> 01:52.590
I got your message.
What's going on?

01:52.608 --> 01:55.777
Partners meeting.
Essential personnel only.

01:55.828 --> 01:56.868
In the middle
of the night?

01:56.912 --> 01:58.446
You afraid
of the dark?

01:58.497 --> 01:59.831
I wouldn't be if I had
my Cookie Monster with me.

01:59.915 --> 02:01.082
Well, then go get him,

02:01.149 --> 02:03.918
because we're finalizing
the terms of the merger.

02:03.985 --> 02:04.919
We?

02:04.986 --> 02:06.370
We.

02:06.455 --> 02:08.288
So I'm a partner now?

02:08.340 --> 02:09.707
Easy, Marcia Clark.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.876
Jessica and I
discussed it.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.095
You're responsible
for making this merger happen.

02:14.162 --> 02:15.596
You deserve
to be here.

02:15.664 --> 02:17.765
So Jessica and you
talked?

02:17.833 --> 02:18.766
You forgave her?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.835
She won.
I lost.

02:20.886 --> 02:21.853
Nothing to forgive.

02:21.937 --> 02:24.021
And me?

02:24.106 --> 02:27.225
You did
what you had to do.

02:29.177 --> 02:33.197
You have no idea
how much I needed to hear that.

02:35.951 --> 02:37.068
The merger is complete.

02:37.152 --> 02:38.352
And we would like
to show everyone

02:38.403 --> 02:40.955
that the new Darby Pearson
will be stronger,

02:41.022 --> 02:42.356
better connected--

02:42.407 --> 02:44.792
And most importantly,
based on a foundation that is--

02:44.860 --> 02:45.910
Full of shit.

02:45.994 --> 02:46.994
What the hell's
going on?

02:47.045 --> 02:49.413
- I told her.
- Told her what?

02:49.498 --> 02:51.132
That Mike Ross
is a fraud,

02:51.199 --> 02:52.967
and I am not going
to let him get away with it.

02:53.034 --> 02:54.085
How could you do this?

02:54.169 --> 02:56.537
You did this
to yourself.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.899
How long are you going
to keep staring at that offer?

03:07.983 --> 03:09.433
Until one of us blinks.

03:09.518 --> 03:11.185
Deron signed it.
You said it was great.

03:11.236 --> 03:12.520
I'm not interested
in great.

03:12.571 --> 03:15.890
I want it to know
who its daddy is.

03:19.444 --> 03:20.661
What is it, Donna?

03:20.729 --> 03:24.498
It's Sunday night.
Darby needs an answer.

03:24.566 --> 03:27.001
London.
Send her to London.

03:32.841 --> 03:35.910
Do you want
to talk about it?

03:38.297 --> 03:40.014
Have Ray
meet me downstairs.

03:40.081 --> 03:42.016
And where should I say
you're going?

03:42.083 --> 03:44.101
Brooklyn.

04:04.373 --> 04:06.707
I did not expect
the great Harvey Specter

04:06.775 --> 04:07.708
to come all the way
to Brooklyn

04:07.776 --> 04:09.243
just to deliver
a contract.

04:09.294 --> 04:11.329
That's good,
'cause I came for the hot dogs.

04:11.413 --> 04:13.464
I told you,
that was our final offer.

04:13.548 --> 04:15.082
You did,
but the third quarter's

04:15.133 --> 04:16.750
about to end,
and if you want Deron Williams

04:16.802 --> 04:19.620
playing for you
in the fourth,

04:19.671 --> 04:22.223
this is his number.

04:23.842 --> 04:25.059
Even if you had
another offer,

04:25.126 --> 04:26.460
which you don't,

04:26.511 --> 04:29.146
he can't leave
in the middle of a game.

04:29.231 --> 04:30.731
I was talking
about the fourth quarter

04:30.799 --> 04:32.016
of game seven,

04:32.100 --> 04:33.901
when you're looking
to lock up a championship,

04:33.902 --> 04:36.904
because the question isn't
"do you want Deron or not?"

04:36.972 --> 04:39.640
It's "do you want
a ring or not?"

04:39.691 --> 04:41.075
You got nothing.

04:41.142 --> 04:43.277
And I told you,
that's my final offer.

04:43.328 --> 04:44.278
Then I guess I'll just have
to go bring Deron

04:44.329 --> 04:45.446
his new Mavs jersey then.

04:45.497 --> 04:47.365
There's no way
Mark Cuban pays that much.

04:47.449 --> 04:48.649
Why don't you call him
and ask?

04:48.700 --> 04:51.285
Oh, wait, you can't,
because he hates you.

04:51.336 --> 04:52.286
Bullshit.

04:52.337 --> 04:53.371
We may not
be blood brothers,

04:53.455 --> 04:54.372
but he doesn't
hate me.

04:54.456 --> 04:55.873
Oh, he does now.

04:55.958 --> 05:00.261
Evidently, he found out
about that thing from last May.

05:00.328 --> 05:01.345
How do you know that?

05:01.430 --> 05:03.831
Because I was there
when I told him.

05:03.882 --> 05:05.599
You have
until 10:00 a.m.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.018
Then I'm calling Dallas.

05:07.102 --> 05:09.336
And Mark may not
take your call,

05:09.388 --> 05:13.357
but he'll sure as hell
take mine.

05:13.442 --> 05:14.608
How do I know
you're not going to turn around

05:14.676 --> 05:15.726
and get him
to pay more?

05:15.811 --> 05:16.944
You don't.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.446
But if you don't
match this,

05:18.513 --> 05:20.898
you'll never find out.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.297
Jessica.

05:36.364 --> 05:37.331
Harvey.

05:37.382 --> 05:39.333
I don't recall
giving you my key.

05:39.384 --> 05:41.419
I don't recall authorizing you
to negotiate

05:41.503 --> 05:42.870
behind Deron Williams' back.

05:42.921 --> 05:44.221
His back
is just fine.

05:44.306 --> 05:46.173
I'm standing
right behind it.

05:46.224 --> 05:49.710
Then why is the contract
he signed in my hand?

05:51.763 --> 05:52.980
How much
did you ask for?

05:53.048 --> 05:55.182
Triple.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.734
You out of your mind?

05:56.818 --> 05:57.768
We have leverage.

05:57.853 --> 06:00.354
And what is that?

06:00.405 --> 06:02.523
- It's complicated.
- Simplify it for me.

06:02.574 --> 06:04.725
- I bluffed him.
- That's not leverage.

06:04.776 --> 06:05.826
It is
if he believes it.

06:05.894 --> 06:07.445
And if it fails,
he fires us

06:07.529 --> 06:09.163
and takes ten other players
with him.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.831
Then it better not fail.

06:10.899 --> 06:13.617
You asked the man
for triple.

06:13.702 --> 06:15.582
If I had what I said I had,
that's what I'd get.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.205
I don't ask for triple,
he knows I'm bluffing.

06:18.256 --> 06:19.790
Then don't bluff
in the first place.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.676
I'm afraid
that's what I do.

06:22.744 --> 06:23.878
You know
what I think?

06:23.929 --> 06:25.179
I think you want it
to fail.

06:25.246 --> 06:26.597
I think
you're stuck

06:26.681 --> 06:27.681
with a merger
you don't want

06:27.749 --> 06:29.683
and a noncompete
you can't stand,

06:29.751 --> 06:31.385
and you're trying
to get me to fire you.

06:31.436 --> 06:33.270
I could bust
that noncompete wide open.

06:33.355 --> 06:34.638
But you gave me
your word.

06:34.723 --> 06:36.941
Which is
why I'm staying.

06:37.025 --> 06:39.443
Jessica, I've always
operated this way.

06:39.528 --> 06:42.196
It's what you hired me for,
it's what you pay me for,

06:42.263 --> 06:44.365
and it used to be
what you valued me for.

06:44.432 --> 06:45.566
I'm not going
to fire you.

06:45.617 --> 06:47.985
Neither is Deron Williams.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.453
Nets just caved.

06:49.538 --> 06:52.656
So unless you're looking
to cook me breakfast tomorrow,

06:52.741 --> 06:54.208
I'd say we're done.

07:04.669 --> 07:06.470
I told you
I needed time.

07:06.555 --> 07:07.755
I know,
but it's been two days,

07:07.789 --> 07:08.722
and I can't
take it anymore.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.926
I had to see you.

07:16.431 --> 07:20.351
I don't want any comments
about how messy the place is.

07:20.435 --> 07:21.969
Okay.

07:22.020 --> 07:26.907
And what would clean
look like?

07:26.975 --> 07:29.643
Don't even think
about it.

07:29.694 --> 07:32.312
I can't not think
about it, all right?

07:32.364 --> 07:34.281
It's all I've been able
to think about for two days.

07:34.332 --> 07:36.033
Mike, why are you here?

07:36.118 --> 07:38.619
Because that's not going
to happen.

07:38.670 --> 07:39.987
Now or ever?

07:40.038 --> 07:42.840
You lied to me
about everything.

07:42.924 --> 07:44.175
Rachel--

07:44.259 --> 07:45.209
Do you remember
when I told you I needed time?

07:45.293 --> 07:46.827
That's what
I needed it for--

07:46.878 --> 07:49.430
to process this bomb
that you dropped on me.

07:49.497 --> 07:53.634
I had a nightmare.

07:53.685 --> 07:55.136
You asked why I'm here.
That's why.

07:55.187 --> 07:57.605
I--

07:57.672 --> 07:59.440
you exposed me
to the entire firm.

07:59.507 --> 08:01.308
- I would never do that.
- I know.

08:01.359 --> 08:02.843
And I woke up,
and I realized

08:02.894 --> 08:04.812
that the real nightmare
wouldn't even be that.

08:04.863 --> 08:09.283
The real nightmare
would be--

08:09.350 --> 08:12.987
would be if you didn't want
to be with me.

08:13.038 --> 08:14.321
Do you really
mean that?

08:14.372 --> 08:17.458
I meant it
the first time I ever saw you.

08:19.161 --> 08:24.748
Rachel, I know that I'm not
who you want me to be,

08:24.833 --> 08:26.967
but--but you know
what happened in that room.

08:27.035 --> 08:28.219
You know
what we both felt.

08:28.303 --> 08:30.304
I--

08:30.371 --> 08:32.673
I don't want
to lose that.

08:35.227 --> 08:37.311
I just keep wishing
you never told me.

08:37.378 --> 08:40.681
But then it never
would have happened.

08:40.732 --> 08:43.049
And it did.

08:43.101 --> 08:44.768
And I'm--

08:44.853 --> 08:46.904
I'm really glad
that it did.

08:48.356 --> 08:52.026
I am too.

08:52.077 --> 08:53.944
But what happens
if you get caught?

08:54.029 --> 08:57.364
Because what you had
may have been a nightmare, Mike,

08:57.415 --> 08:58.532
but you can't tell me
you're not afraid

08:58.583 --> 08:59.533
of being exposed.

08:59.584 --> 09:00.834
Of course I am.

09:00.902 --> 09:03.337
But there's nothing
that I can do about it.

09:03.404 --> 09:06.290
Well, maybe there is.

09:06.374 --> 09:08.676
What are you saying?

09:08.743 --> 09:11.295
Quit.

09:11.379 --> 09:13.946
Go in tomorrow,
and just quit.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.103
I need to talk to you.

10:55.170 --> 10:57.305
You want to talk
about how things played out,

10:57.356 --> 11:00.725
but the place to do that
is somewhere more private.

11:00.810 --> 11:04.279
You didn't just come through
on the merger.

11:04.346 --> 11:05.947
You bluffed Hardman,

11:06.014 --> 11:08.316
turned Monica Eton,

11:08.367 --> 11:09.617
and put us over the top
on Folsom Foods.

11:09.685 --> 11:11.986
Now that's a lot
of coming through in the clutch.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.322
And I wouldn't have saved
your ass

11:14.373 --> 11:17.742
if I didn't think
you deserved to be here.

11:17.827 --> 11:18.993
I don't know
what to say.

11:19.044 --> 11:20.912
Well, the usual response is
"thank you."

11:20.996 --> 11:22.297
The usual road
to getting here

11:22.364 --> 11:24.332
doesn't involve
stabbing someone in the back.

11:24.383 --> 11:27.552
Doesn't it?

11:29.672 --> 11:31.339
When I was 16,

11:31.390 --> 11:33.308
I came home,
my mother sat me down,

11:33.375 --> 11:35.477
and said my parents
were separating.

11:35.544 --> 11:38.096
Trial basis.

11:38.180 --> 11:41.065
But the good news was
she was going to get me a car

11:41.150 --> 11:42.684
to help with my sister.

11:42.735 --> 11:46.354
All my friends talked about
how lucky I was to have it.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.741
I hated that car.

11:49.825 --> 11:52.911
Every time I got in it, I--

11:52.995 --> 11:54.913
it just reminded me.

11:54.997 --> 11:57.031
Why are you telling me this?

11:57.082 --> 11:59.167
Because five years later,

11:59.234 --> 12:03.571
that same car got me to Harvard,
which led me here.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.757
So you can think
of this office

12:05.841 --> 12:09.093
as a reminder
of what you did to Harvey

12:09.178 --> 12:12.130
or as a symbol
of what you can accomplish

12:12.214 --> 12:14.299
at the firm.

12:14.383 --> 12:17.752
Now, do you still
have something to say?

12:17.803 --> 12:20.939
No.

12:21.023 --> 12:23.358
No, I don't.

12:26.028 --> 12:28.029
They ever get back together?

12:28.096 --> 12:30.932
No.

12:30.983 --> 12:34.402
No, they didn't.

12:45.614 --> 12:48.216
Ah, God!
Damn it!

12:48.283 --> 12:49.300
Louis, what happened?

12:49.385 --> 12:51.135
Oh.
I'll tell you what happened.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.253
This stupid merger.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.421
It's bad enough
my vote is worth

12:53.472 --> 12:54.639
1/3 of what it was
last week.

12:54.723 --> 12:56.174
Now our uni-balls, gone.

12:56.258 --> 12:57.642
Our...What?

12:57.726 --> 12:58.726
Pens, Donna.

12:58.794 --> 13:00.144
The new quartermaster,

13:00.229 --> 13:03.631
Barbara L. Tottingham, will not
buy us any more uni-balls.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.634
There's not one single uni-ball
in this entire firm.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.770
- Please stop saying uni-ball.
- No, I will not.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.989
Stuck
with these stupid plastic things

13:11.073 --> 13:12.273
that keep breaking.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.075
So buy your own pen.

13:14.142 --> 13:16.778
Bu

13:16.829 --> 13:18.913
okay.

13:18.981 --> 13:20.081
There are two things
in this firm

13:20.148 --> 13:22.367
that I hold very sacred--
my uni-balls

13:22.451 --> 13:24.118
and my raspberry Bran bars.

13:24.169 --> 13:25.587
And if I have to go
and buy 'em myself,

13:25.654 --> 13:28.256
well, then,
this Barbara L. Tottingham

13:28.323 --> 13:29.841
has a message for me,
loud and clear,

13:29.925 --> 13:31.259
and that's "Louis Litt,
go screw yourself."

13:31.326 --> 13:32.961
Louis, the ink on your face.
You've got just, like--

13:33.012 --> 13:34.295
you've got, like,
a little bit right there.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.130
Where, here?

13:36.181 --> 13:38.466
No, I think you've gotta
give it, like, a good--

13:38.517 --> 13:39.467
Okay, fine.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.936
Gone?

13:42.004 --> 13:44.305
Thank you, Donna.
You're a true friend.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.773
I got your back.

13:45.841 --> 13:47.141
Hey, do you remember

13:47.192 --> 13:48.843
when you used to do
those rotator cuff exercises?

13:48.894 --> 13:50.344
Oh, yeah,
what are you kidding? Of course.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.780
Every day for, like, 18 months.
Why do you ask?

13:52.848 --> 13:55.283
No reason.

13:59.204 --> 14:01.205
Edward.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.824
Jessica,
how lovely to see you.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.409
I wanted to thank you.

14:04.493 --> 14:06.911
- Ah. You saw the sign.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.413
You didn't have
to do that.

14:08.497 --> 14:10.248
Our agreement stipulates
Darby Pearson,

14:10.332 --> 14:11.749
not Pearson Darby.

14:11.834 --> 14:16.054
Our agreement also stipulates
a 51/49 percentage structure.

14:16.138 --> 14:17.705
And this is your way
of showing me

14:17.756 --> 14:19.307
that you think of it
as 50/50.

14:19.374 --> 14:21.476
- Merely a gesture.
- Ah.

14:21.543 --> 14:22.760
Heck of a gesture.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.712
How would you propose
to a woman?

14:24.763 --> 14:25.930
A woman?

14:26.015 --> 14:28.599
I think we both know that--
Yes, we do.

14:28.684 --> 14:30.735
Anyway...

14:30.819 --> 14:32.570
It is shaping up
to be a lovely day.

14:32.655 --> 14:33.988
Oh, I wish
I could say that same.

14:34.056 --> 14:35.657
I assume you know
about the latest goings-on

14:35.724 --> 14:37.058
with Hessington Oil.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.077
I wouldn't be much
of a partner if I didn't.

14:39.161 --> 14:42.280
Now they've decide to take on
Ava Hessington personally.

14:42.364 --> 14:44.499
- Who is they?
- The U.S. government.

14:44.566 --> 14:46.451
I've decided to let Harvey
handle it.

14:46.535 --> 14:48.670
- Why?
- Why not?

14:48.737 --> 14:49.904
It's not a good time.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.956
He's still digesting
the merger.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.841
- Meaning?
- He's acting out.

14:53.909 --> 14:55.376
Well, he may be
acting out,

14:55.427 --> 14:58.346
but I understand he just got
his client triple the money.

14:58.413 --> 15:01.015
By taking a huge risk
he didn't have to.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.884
This case,
he may have to.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.086
So that's why Harvey.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.306
And this case is more
important to me than just money.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.558
And why is that?

15:10.609 --> 15:13.111
Because it is.

15:15.430 --> 15:16.597
What if I said no?

15:16.648 --> 15:19.266
I'm afraid that's not an option.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.869
So I guess
that sign

15:21.937 --> 15:24.072
really doesn't mean 50/50
after all.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.741
I did say
it was merely a gesture.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.877
Hmm.

15:29.945 --> 15:31.913
You keep showing up
to surprise me,

15:31.964 --> 15:33.614
people are gonna
get the wrong idea.

15:33.665 --> 15:36.134
People are going to think
what they're going to think.

15:36.218 --> 15:38.753
I'm here to bury the hatchet.
And what prompted that?

15:38.804 --> 15:41.089
Darby found out what you did
with Deron Williams.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.790
Don't tell me.
He was impressed.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.625
He was pissed.

15:44.676 --> 15:45.793
Thinks you're trying
to get fired.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.678
And you told him
how smart he was.

15:47.763 --> 15:50.014
I told him
you said it wasn't true

15:50.099 --> 15:51.599
and that I believed you,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.268
and then I fought to give you
a chance to prove it.

15:54.319 --> 15:56.637
Ava Hessington.

15:56.688 --> 15:57.638
I got you on it.

15:57.689 --> 15:58.806
What does that matter
to me?

15:58.857 --> 15:59.907
Harvey,

15:59.975 --> 16:02.309
I know you and I
have had our problems,

16:02.361 --> 16:04.362
but this is a chance
for us to move past it.

16:04.446 --> 16:05.613
Let's take it.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.532
You really do
wanna make up.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.534
I never wanted to be at odds
in the first place.

16:09.618 --> 16:13.287
Neither did I.

16:13.338 --> 16:15.590
Are we good?

16:15.657 --> 16:18.209
Don't you wanna tell me
I better win this goddamn case?

16:18.293 --> 16:19.994
I didn't think
I had to.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.606
Never stopped you
from saying it before.

16:21.630 --> 16:24.549
Well, I'm learning
to let go.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.885
Oh, Harvey,
there is one more thing.

16:27.970 --> 16:31.639
You better win
this goddamn case.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.027
I know
it's not my place,

16:53.078 --> 16:56.047
but you really suck
at quitting.

16:56.131 --> 16:57.198
I can explain.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.635
No need.
It was just a suggestion.

17:00.702 --> 17:01.969
Rachel, I tried to do it,
but--

17:02.037 --> 17:05.372
But then Jessica
gave you this office to stay?

17:05.424 --> 17:06.874
Actually,
she gave me this office

17:06.925 --> 17:11.012
before I could even
bring it up.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.096
Well, aren't you

17:12.181 --> 17:13.347
just the luckiest person
in the world?

17:13.397 --> 17:14.714
Rachel--

17:14.766 --> 17:16.567
You came to me,
you were petrified

17:16.652 --> 17:18.551
of being exposed,
and I gave you a way out.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.022
And now, 12 hours later,
you're in a brand-new office

17:22.074 --> 17:23.324
with a diploma on the wall
that, for all I know,

17:23.391 --> 17:24.659
came from Kinko's.

17:24.726 --> 17:26.861
What do you want me to do?
Everyone hangs one.

17:26.912 --> 17:31.232
No, Mike,
everyone doesn't just hang one.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.700
So that's
what this is really about.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.735
You're damn right
it is.

17:34.786 --> 17:38.623
I've been trying to earn one
for as long as I can remember.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.175
And you have one and everything
that goes with it,

17:41.243 --> 17:43.678
and you didn't do
a single thing to deserve it.

17:43.745 --> 17:44.795
You have no idea
what I have or haven't done

17:44.880 --> 17:46.380
to get where I am.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.716
And that's
the whole problem.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.185
I have no idea
who you are.

18:26.095 --> 18:29.765
Harvey, I'm just in the middle
of a little afternoon crossword.

18:29.816 --> 18:30.933
Are you a puzzler?

18:30.984 --> 18:32.568
Don't you have work
to do?

18:32.635 --> 18:34.135
My dear fellow,
if I have to do work,

18:34.187 --> 18:36.104
then I'm not doing my job.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.105
What can I do
for you?

18:37.157 --> 18:38.490
Jessica told me

18:38.575 --> 18:40.359
that you agreed to let me
be lead on Ava Hessington.

18:40.443 --> 18:41.743
I wanted to thank you.

18:41.811 --> 18:44.145
- You're welcome.
- There's just one problem.

18:44.197 --> 18:46.915
You didn't agree to anything.
You demanded it.

18:46.983 --> 18:48.784
And you let Jessica
play good cop

18:48.835 --> 18:51.170
because you didn't wanna
undermine the chain of command.

18:51.254 --> 18:53.121
That's quite
the conspiracy theory.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.656
Well,
here's the good news.

18:54.707 --> 18:56.658
My plate's a little full
right now.

18:56.709 --> 18:59.461
And since you didn't want me
on this case in the first place,

18:59.512 --> 19:01.329
why don't you let
somebody else handle it?

19:01.381 --> 19:03.432
Good luck.
I hear it's a tough one.

19:03.499 --> 19:06.334
What do you want?

19:06.386 --> 19:08.103
I want out.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.271
I win this,

19:09.338 --> 19:11.640
you tear up my noncompete,
and you fire me.

19:11.691 --> 19:14.009
You hate this merger
that much.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.677
I had an agreement
with Jessica,

19:15.728 --> 19:16.945
and I honored it.

19:17.013 --> 19:19.681
Then she accused me
of trying to get fired.

19:19.732 --> 19:21.200
Then she lied to me

19:21.284 --> 19:22.818
by claiming
that she fought for me

19:22.869 --> 19:24.152
to be on this case.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.372
She really does wanna
make up with you, you know.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.041
Funny way
of showing it.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.492
Ironic.

19:30.543 --> 19:32.578
Her belief that you wanted
to be fired

19:32.662 --> 19:35.080
led you to wanting
to be fired.

19:35.164 --> 19:38.000
Do we have
a deal or not?

19:38.051 --> 19:42.387
It appears we do.

19:49.429 --> 19:52.180
Oh, hey.
Uh, go ahead.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.349
No, that's all right.
You were here first.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.717
Why are you being
so polite?

19:55.768 --> 19:56.985
Come on, you have
one stupid copy.

19:57.053 --> 19:58.437
You could've finished it
already.

19:58.521 --> 20:00.939
Louis, I--

20:01.024 --> 20:04.076
A letter of resignation?

20:04.160 --> 20:05.110
Why?

20:05.194 --> 20:07.112
It's complicated.

20:07.196 --> 20:10.666
Well, simplify it for me,
Mike.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.202
Harvey.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.537
He's the one
who hired me.

20:15.588 --> 20:17.072
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

20:17.123 --> 20:18.406
What are you talking about?
He just gave you a new office.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.042
No, Jessica gave me
a new office.

20:20.093 --> 20:24.913
If it was up to Harvey,
I wouldn't even have a cubicle.

20:24.964 --> 20:27.716
What happened?

20:27.767 --> 20:31.086
All that matters is that,
uh, I can't fix it.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.940
You know, when we were
in the bullpen,

20:35.024 --> 20:37.943
Harvey was like Superman.

20:38.027 --> 20:39.895
And then, one day,

20:39.946 --> 20:41.897
Hardman decided to just
knock him down a peg.

20:41.948 --> 20:43.532
Gave him
this bullshit assignment,

20:43.599 --> 20:45.400
undoable workload,
unwinnable case.

20:45.451 --> 20:47.035
And I took it
as a chance

20:47.103 --> 20:49.454
to break down his walls
and offer my help.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.739
And I just thought,
this just might be

20:50.790 --> 20:52.107
the chance
that we could become--

20:52.158 --> 20:54.793
- Friends.
- Yeah.

20:54.877 --> 20:58.330
And he looked at me--
how dare I?

20:58.414 --> 20:59.831
I get it.
He's alone.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.466
He always has been.
He always will be.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.502
Always was.

21:03.586 --> 21:06.221
Harvey is
not Superman anymore.

21:07.807 --> 21:11.426
He's Batman.

21:11.477 --> 21:13.312
And Batman needs Robin.

21:13.396 --> 21:15.630
And I just need
to remind him of that.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.265
What's the one thing
that Harvey values

21:17.317 --> 21:18.433
over everything else?

21:18.484 --> 21:19.568
- Winning.
- Yeah.

21:19.635 --> 21:20.769
You help him win,

21:20.820 --> 21:22.804
he'll remember
why he needs you.

21:22.855 --> 21:24.906
I have to figure out
what cases he's working on.

21:24.974 --> 21:26.408
The I.T. Department
has access to every computer

21:26.475 --> 21:28.744
in the entire firm,
syncs up every night.

21:28.811 --> 21:31.246
So all I have to do is get
access to Harvey's hard drive.

21:31.313 --> 21:33.314
That place is a fortress.

21:35.868 --> 21:37.536
Benjamin.

21:39.255 --> 21:40.706
It's you.

21:40.790 --> 21:42.424
Aw, that's sweet.
You remember me.

21:42.491 --> 21:43.658
Oh, yes.

21:43.710 --> 21:45.660
I remember everyone
who's ever bamboozled me

21:45.712 --> 21:47.495
into giving them
a top-of-the-line laptop.

21:47.547 --> 21:48.997
Their names
are Michael Ross.

21:49.048 --> 21:51.016
I didn't bamboozle you,
Benjamin.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.500
I won it
fair and square.

21:52.552 --> 21:55.020
And I've been tracking
every Internet move you've made

21:55.104 --> 21:58.023
for the past ten months,
waiting for the slipup.

21:58.107 --> 22:00.609
Bet you thought you had me
at teenybikini.com.

22:00.676 --> 22:02.561
No.
No, no.

22:02.645 --> 22:04.062
Because I cross-referenced that

22:04.147 --> 22:06.848
with your workplace
harassment case, and I knew.

22:06.899 --> 22:08.817
But don't think I'm not aware
that you went home for dinner

22:08.868 --> 22:11.319
and used your personal computer
to go back there.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.288
Okay,
that's not actionable,

22:13.355 --> 22:15.374
but hacking
my personal computer is.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.210
Good luck proving that.
Now, what do you want?

22:18.294 --> 22:20.195
- I want access to a hard drive.
- No way.

22:20.246 --> 22:21.546
Not only that,
I want you to give me

22:21.631 --> 22:23.382
whatever I want
whenever I want it

22:23.466 --> 22:24.549
for the rest
of your life.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.917
And why would I
do that?

22:26.002 --> 22:27.386
Oh, right.

22:27.470 --> 22:30.872
Because I just recorded you
admitting to violating the law.

22:30.923 --> 22:33.975
- The XJS-5000.
- Mm-hmm.

22:34.043 --> 22:35.594
- You--you set me up.
- Yep.

22:35.678 --> 22:37.646
You knew that I would
track your home computer.

22:37.713 --> 22:39.147
And after
you've been convicted,

22:39.215 --> 22:42.651
you'll be lucky to be hired
as a network administrator...

22:42.718 --> 22:44.903
At a high school...

22:44.987 --> 22:46.855
In Jersey.

22:46.906 --> 22:48.940
How long are you gonna
keep at this?

22:49.025 --> 22:50.992
Until I find out
what I just got myself into.

22:51.060 --> 22:52.611
I mean, look at this stack
of papers.

22:52.695 --> 22:55.614
It's 1/5 of the files
we have on Ava Hessington.

22:55.698 --> 22:58.250
- You need a shortcut.
- Well, I'm not going to Mike.

22:58.334 --> 23:00.702
I'm not talking
about him.

23:00.753 --> 23:03.588
Ava Hessington
started in the London office.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.175
It's too late.

23:07.243 --> 23:09.928
No, it's not.

23:13.716 --> 23:15.133
You gotta be
kidding me.

23:15.218 --> 23:17.185
How did you get
through security?

23:17.253 --> 23:19.304
Charm and this smile.

23:19.388 --> 23:20.555
You bought a ticket,
didn't you?

23:20.606 --> 23:22.390
Trinidad-Tobago.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.759
First-class?
You're not even going.

23:24.811 --> 23:27.529
I prefer to not travel
in style.

23:27.596 --> 23:29.064
I'd prefer to be alone
right now.

23:29.115 --> 23:31.533
Scottie,
I need your help.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.034
I'm sorry,
I have a plane to catch.

23:33.102 --> 23:34.536
A plane, by the way,
that you put me on.

23:34.603 --> 23:36.955
After I saved your job,
which you accepted.

23:37.039 --> 23:38.606
So now we're both working
for the same firm.

23:38.658 --> 23:40.441
Oh, I guess now I'm just
one of the many partners

23:40.493 --> 23:41.626
who gets to work with you

23:41.711 --> 23:43.879
and yet wants nothing to do
with you.

23:43.946 --> 23:45.831
Scottie.

23:45.915 --> 23:48.616
Please!

23:48.668 --> 23:50.418
You once helped me
without me asking.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.338
Well, now I'm asking.

23:53.422 --> 23:55.557
Then tell me something.

23:55.624 --> 23:57.476
Something what?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.511
Just...

24:01.597 --> 24:04.266
Something.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.735
I remember the first time
I ever saw you.

24:06.802 --> 24:08.603
Con Law.

24:08.654 --> 24:10.939
You threw me some line, and I
gave you shit about your hair.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.824
No, it was two weeks
before that

24:12.909 --> 24:14.409
outside Langdell.

24:14.476 --> 24:16.644
You were wearing a blue dress.
The wind was blowing.

24:16.696 --> 24:19.414
When I saw your face,
it stopped me dead in my tracks.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.200
That's not enough.

24:22.285 --> 24:23.919
Well, I'm not finished.

24:23.986 --> 24:26.004
The next time I saw you
was Con Law.

24:26.088 --> 24:28.423
You answered the first question
that Dyson asked,

24:28.490 --> 24:31.543
and I knew that that face
that blew me away

24:31.627 --> 24:34.045
was your second best asset.

24:34.130 --> 24:36.348
Look, you mean
something to me.

24:36.432 --> 24:38.266
You've always meant
something to me,

24:38.334 --> 24:43.188
and you always will mean
something to me.

24:46.609 --> 24:49.528
You are such a dick.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.148
What do you need, Harvey?

24:53.199 --> 24:54.816
Ava Hessington.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.188
Well, this is gonna
take a while.

25:00.239 --> 25:04.159
So you're gonna
buy me a drink,

25:04.210 --> 25:07.879
and I'm gonna take that ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

25:13.781 --> 25:15.781
Okay, Norma,
it's been 24 hours.

25:15.804 --> 25:17.788
If you can't get me Barbara lL.
Tottingham on the phone,

25:17.839 --> 25:19.173
well, then guess what,
you don't get--

25:19.257 --> 25:22.259
Oh.
It's you!

25:22.310 --> 25:23.761
Well, you tell Norma if I don't
have a package of uni-balls

25:23.812 --> 25:25.095
on my desk by noon,

25:25.146 --> 25:26.964
she can kiss her trip
to Dollywood good-bye.

25:27.015 --> 25:28.315
Now, why don't you
get the hell out of here,

25:28.400 --> 25:31.435
so I can fix myself
a raspberry Bran bar in peace?

25:31.486 --> 25:34.405
What are you looking at?

25:42.313 --> 25:43.864
Looking for this?

25:43.949 --> 25:46.200
It's the last one.

25:46.284 --> 25:48.652
Not today.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.654
You're Barbara L. Tottingham.

25:50.705 --> 25:53.040
I hardly made it difficult
to figure out.

25:53.124 --> 25:55.325
Barbara L. Tottingham.

25:55.377 --> 25:59.329
B.L.T.
Which is a sandwich.

25:59.381 --> 26:01.215
And what does one put
on a B.L.T.?

26:01.299 --> 26:02.716
Mayonnaise,
invented by the French.

26:02.801 --> 26:04.969
Which points directly
to another French sandwich.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.470
Of course, the monte cristo,
as in the Count of Monte Cristo.

26:06.521 --> 26:07.688
How did I not see that?

26:07.772 --> 26:08.772
It was staring me
right in the face.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.840
Indeed it was.

26:09.891 --> 26:10.975
The count returned
from the dead,

26:11.026 --> 26:12.393
as I am now returned

26:12.477 --> 26:14.478
from the banishment
to which you sentenced me...

26:14.529 --> 26:15.980
As quartermaster.

26:16.031 --> 26:17.614
I would ask you
how you did it,

26:17.682 --> 26:20.017
but I know you wouldn't tell me,
because I wouldn't tell you.

26:20.068 --> 26:21.201
What I will tell you is

26:21.286 --> 26:22.369
that during my time
in the wilderness--

26:22.454 --> 26:24.822
- It was three days.
- And nights.

26:24.873 --> 26:26.040
I endeavored to discover

26:26.124 --> 26:28.375
what perquisites
you value most in this firm--

26:28.460 --> 26:30.794
your beloved Bran bars.

26:30.862 --> 26:31.962
You're never going
to have them.

26:32.030 --> 26:33.380
I can buy them myself.

26:33.465 --> 26:35.306
Even if you were willing
to buy them yourself--

26:35.366 --> 26:37.134
which we both know
you aren't--

26:37.201 --> 26:39.386
you'll never eat them
on Pearson Darby grounds.

26:39.471 --> 26:40.387
You didn't.

26:40.472 --> 26:43.090
I did.
They're banned.

26:46.511 --> 26:47.845
Wait a second.

26:47.896 --> 26:51.148
You're telling me that
Barbara L. Tottingham is Nigel?

26:51.215 --> 26:52.516
No.
Stay with me.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.986
B.L.T., mayonnaise,
monte cristo sandwich.

26:56.054 --> 26:57.271
Oh, my God,
I'm so hungry.

26:57.355 --> 26:58.572
- Donna.
- What?

26:58.656 --> 27:00.524
What do you want from me, Louis?
I'm busy.

27:00.575 --> 27:03.060
So you can't have your pens
or your Bran bars, big deal.

27:03.111 --> 27:04.445
Donna, listen.

27:04.529 --> 27:05.829
When I was in ninth grade,

27:05.897 --> 27:07.417
there was this wrestler
Randy Cusumano.

27:07.499 --> 27:09.249
And one day after school
in the locker room,

27:09.334 --> 27:11.085
he pinned me down, and he taped
my butt cheeks together.

27:11.169 --> 27:12.870
Wait a second, is this the
story from <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

27:12.921 --> 27:14.421
I'm not familiar
with that song.

27:14.506 --> 27:17.124
Never mind.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.459
Look, I swore
that I would get him back

27:18.543 --> 27:20.911
no matter what it took.

27:20.962 --> 27:23.013
What did it take?

27:23.081 --> 27:24.214
Ah, you don't really
wanna know.

27:24.265 --> 27:25.549
Thank you.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.084
The point is
if I'm Nigel and Nigel's me,

27:27.135 --> 27:29.803
he's not gonna stop
at Bran bars and pens.

27:29.888 --> 27:32.473
I gotta take care of Nigel
once and for all.

27:34.225 --> 27:36.727
You need to get rid of him
as quartermaster.

27:36.778 --> 27:37.978
Miss Hessington,

27:38.063 --> 27:40.064
first of all, I want you
to familiarize yourself

27:40.115 --> 27:41.231
with this man.

27:41.282 --> 27:42.900
U.S. attorney
Richard Jensen.

27:42.951 --> 27:44.568
He's one of the best
there is,

27:44.619 --> 27:45.903
and he's
who we'll be going up against.

27:45.954 --> 27:47.371
Well, that's all
well and good, Mr. Specter,

27:47.438 --> 27:48.989
but I have one question.

27:49.074 --> 27:51.158
Why should I hire you?

27:51.242 --> 27:52.576
Because you trust
Edward Darby.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.745
I'm afraid that only gets you
in the room.

27:54.796 --> 27:56.780
This civil servant

27:56.831 --> 27:58.465
seems to have
a personal vendetta against me,

27:58.550 --> 27:59.833
and I don't even know why.

27:59.918 --> 28:00.951
Well, I do.

28:01.002 --> 28:02.285
He needs a head
on a platter.

28:02.337 --> 28:03.670
Why mine?

28:03.755 --> 28:05.889
You've been skirting
environmental laws for a decade.

28:05.957 --> 28:07.975
He's got a chance to nail you,
and he's gonna take it.

28:08.059 --> 28:10.460
This isn't
an environmental allegation.

28:10.512 --> 28:12.629
No, it's a bribery charge,

28:12.680 --> 28:14.848
it's got teeth,
and it's coming your way.

28:14.933 --> 28:17.818
Don't sugarcoat it,
Mr. Specter.

28:17.902 --> 28:19.736
Give it to me straight.
Okay, I will.

28:19.804 --> 28:21.822
Because when he digs
a little deeper,

28:21.906 --> 28:23.140
he's gonna find evidence

28:23.191 --> 28:25.909
of the spill your company
covered up in 2008,

28:25.977 --> 28:28.245
the whistle-blower
you bought off in 2010,

28:28.312 --> 28:32.082
and the environmental impact
study you doctored in 2006.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.201
So it's not gonna be hard
to convince a jury

28:34.285 --> 28:36.620
that you're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

28:36.671 --> 28:38.422
to get your pipeline.

28:38.489 --> 28:40.924
And what are you going to do
to stop him?

28:40.992 --> 28:44.828
Bury evidence,
contact witnesses,

28:44.879 --> 28:47.347
or sleep with your rival
pitcher's girlfriend

28:47.432 --> 28:49.550
the night
before the big game?

28:49.634 --> 28:51.268
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

28:51.335 --> 28:52.603
I got it.

28:52.670 --> 28:55.222
I looked into you.
You looked into me.

28:55.306 --> 28:56.773
I actually prefer it
that way.

28:56.841 --> 28:58.175
And why is that?

28:58.226 --> 28:59.476
Because you know
what I'll do to win.

28:59.527 --> 29:01.287
Saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

29:01.345 --> 29:03.063
And I won't have
to explain to you

29:03.148 --> 29:04.681
what I did to win
that pipeline.

29:04.732 --> 29:05.983
You bribed them.

29:06.034 --> 29:07.818
Guilty as charged.

29:07.869 --> 29:09.369
And I don't care
what Richard Jensen says.

29:09.454 --> 29:11.155
Every company with a pipeline
over there

29:11.206 --> 29:12.789
did the same thing.

29:12.857 --> 29:14.858
- Is that your defense?
- It's the truth.

29:14.909 --> 29:16.543
It would be nice
if we only found oil

29:16.628 --> 29:19.496
under Texas ranchers
or North Sea fishermen.

29:19.547 --> 29:20.914
But in the real world,

29:20.999 --> 29:24.501
we find it in nasty places
under nasty people.

29:24.552 --> 29:26.587
And any executive worth a damn
does what's needed

29:26.671 --> 29:28.005
or goes out of business.

29:28.056 --> 29:31.391
- Good. We're done.
- Excuse me?

29:31.476 --> 29:33.236
I just needed to know
what I was dealing with

29:33.311 --> 29:34.678
before I make
my next move.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.680
- And what is that?
- I'll let you know.

29:36.731 --> 29:39.266
I haven't officially
hired you yet.

29:39.350 --> 29:41.518
Yes, you have.

29:48.893 --> 29:50.744
How long
you been waiting here?

29:50.828 --> 29:52.613
Since I found out
what you need.

29:52.697 --> 29:54.498
What I need is for you
to leave me alone.

29:54.565 --> 29:57.284
No, what you need is
information on Ava Hessington.

29:57.368 --> 29:59.920
In 2008, her company tried
to destroy evidence--

30:00.004 --> 30:02.239
Of an oil spill?

30:02.290 --> 30:04.208
Okay, well,
in 2010, they--

30:04.259 --> 30:05.842
They bought off
a whistle-blower.

30:05.910 --> 30:07.461
And if the next thing
you're gonna tell me

30:07.545 --> 30:10.514
is about an environmental
impact study in 2006,

30:10.581 --> 30:11.548
don't.

30:11.599 --> 30:13.250
You think
you're not replaceable?

30:13.301 --> 30:15.018
I got all that
from an associate

30:15.086 --> 30:16.553
I picked at random.

30:16.604 --> 30:18.472
I've been doing this
before I met you,

30:18.556 --> 30:21.258
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

30:21.309 --> 30:22.693
You had enough?
No.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.028
No, you know what, I haven't,
because you haven't.

30:25.096 --> 30:26.446
Excuse me?

30:26.531 --> 30:27.781
You haven't said whatever
you have to say to rip me

30:27.865 --> 30:29.032
to shreds enough so that
you can start to forgive me.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.617
So go ahead.

30:30.702 --> 30:31.818
Whatever it takes,
I can take it.

30:31.903 --> 30:33.870
Go!

30:33.938 --> 30:35.539
Harvey, I'm sorry,
all right?

30:35.606 --> 30:36.823
But I need you
to listen to me now.

30:36.908 --> 30:38.625
Listen to you?

30:38.710 --> 30:40.377
You know when I would've
listened to you?

30:40.444 --> 30:41.545
That night.

30:41.612 --> 30:45.282
- Jessica threatened me.
- I don't care.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.550
Anyone comes at you
with any threat at all,

30:46.617 --> 30:47.968
you come to me.

30:48.052 --> 30:49.419
I don't give a shit
if it's the Queen on England.

30:49.470 --> 30:51.471
You come to me.
You tell me!

30:51.556 --> 30:53.173
You tell me everything!

30:53.258 --> 30:55.392
That's what
goddamn loyalty is.

31:12.026 --> 31:13.193
Okay, you're right.

31:13.278 --> 31:14.444
You don't know
who I am

31:14.495 --> 31:15.975
or what I've done
to deserve anything.

31:15.980 --> 31:18.115
So here's what's gonna happen.
I am gonna tell you.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.700
I am gonna tell you
everything,

31:19.784 --> 31:21.251
and when we're done,
either we're gonna be finished,

31:21.319 --> 31:23.253
or we're gonna go back there
and we're gonna do exactly

31:23.321 --> 31:25.589
what we should've done
the other night.

31:25.656 --> 31:27.708
Okay.

31:32.119 --> 31:33.571
Okay, one more time.

31:34.471 --> 31:35.421
Are you ready?
Yes.

31:35.472 --> 31:36.422
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

31:36.473 --> 31:37.423
Okay.

31:37.474 --> 31:39.225
So I was here.
Mmhmm.

31:39.276 --> 31:41.144
Yeah? And I was running
down here.

31:41.228 --> 31:43.446
And the cops,
they were back here.

31:43.530 --> 31:46.316
So I am running--
let's see, where is it?

31:46.400 --> 31:47.901
Oh, yeah,
it was down here.

31:47.952 --> 31:49.869
And I run into here,

31:49.937 --> 31:51.955
and then Donna,
she was right here.

31:52.039 --> 31:54.824
- Okay.
- So she let me in...

31:54.909 --> 31:56.793
Here.

31:56.877 --> 31:59.545
And then Harvey,
he was right down--

31:59.613 --> 32:00.580
No!

32:00.631 --> 32:01.781
What?

32:01.832 --> 32:04.116
Harvey is not getting
anywhere near there.

32:04.168 --> 32:06.052
Oh, no one is ever
getting anywhere near there.

32:06.119 --> 32:07.387
Oh, you think
you're that good, do you?

32:07.454 --> 32:09.756
It's one
of my many gifts.

32:09.807 --> 32:11.567
Being that good
or thinking you're that good?

32:11.592 --> 32:14.260
Do you want a replay?
'Cause I will go right now.

32:14.311 --> 32:16.729
- Like you could.
- I could!

32:16.797 --> 32:19.015
Soon...ish.

32:19.099 --> 32:20.800
Do you have, like,
an energy drink or something?

32:20.851 --> 32:22.902
- Oh.
- Come on! We were up all night.

32:22.970 --> 32:24.303
You kept me up
all night.

32:24.355 --> 32:27.306
<i>You</i> kept me up all night.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.669
I can't tell you
how it feels

32:39.753 --> 32:41.487
that you know.

32:41.538 --> 32:43.489
Mm, well, who knew

32:43.540 --> 32:46.259
that honesty
was the best policy?

32:46.326 --> 32:49.379
Oh, wait.
Everyone knew that.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.350
What?

33:01.692 --> 33:03.977
Can I help you?

33:06.280 --> 33:07.196
Louis Litt.

33:07.281 --> 33:08.815
Oh, I know
who you are.

33:08.866 --> 33:11.234
Freshly minted
senior partner,

33:11.318 --> 33:13.536
expert in matters
of corporate finance,

33:13.620 --> 33:16.022
and the man responsible
for the superb training

33:16.073 --> 33:17.156
of the associates.

33:18.993 --> 33:21.077
You've looked into me.
Mmhmm.

33:21.161 --> 33:24.080
I've looked into you.

33:24.164 --> 33:25.999
Tarte au chocolat
from Cafe Pouchkine.

33:26.050 --> 33:28.367
The best patisserie
in Paris.

33:28.419 --> 33:30.086
A steeping cup
of da Hong pao.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.171
The most expensive tea
in the world.

33:32.222 --> 33:34.173
Two of my favorite things.

33:34.224 --> 33:37.844
What better to enjoy
after signing this order...

33:37.895 --> 33:39.145
Making me quartermaster?

33:39.212 --> 33:40.513
Pity you don't have
a Montblanc pen

33:40.564 --> 33:41.764
for me to sign it with.

33:41.849 --> 33:44.567
With cobalt ink.

33:44.651 --> 33:46.185
We already have
a quartermaster.

33:46.236 --> 33:47.653
Sir, I know...

33:47.721 --> 33:49.772
That this is
Nigel's position

33:49.857 --> 33:52.108
and him losing it
would not be easy for him.

33:52.192 --> 33:53.910
But let me
just assure you,

33:53.994 --> 33:56.913
I'm not just prepared
for this position...

33:56.997 --> 33:59.365
I was born for it.

33:59.416 --> 34:02.368
I have PhDs
in chemical engineering

34:02.419 --> 34:03.920
and petroleum exploration.

34:04.004 --> 34:06.589
I've made it to the top
in a field dominated by men,

34:06.673 --> 34:09.042
and I'm facing
a prison sentence

34:09.092 --> 34:11.210
for an allegation
which any man in my position

34:11.261 --> 34:12.578
would be fined for.

34:12.629 --> 34:14.714
Every similar case
has been settled with a fine,

34:14.764 --> 34:15.931
not prison.

34:16.016 --> 34:17.137
That's what we're proposing.

34:17.184 --> 34:19.217
Well, there's just
one problem.

34:19.268 --> 34:21.687
I'm not charging you
because you're a woman.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.272
I'm charging you
because you're the one I caught.

34:23.357 --> 34:25.808
Ava, can you give us
a minute?

34:34.284 --> 34:36.735
Okay, she's gonna
write you a check.

34:36.786 --> 34:38.071
Let's talk about how much.

34:38.121 --> 34:40.289
I'm sorry, Harvey.

34:40.373 --> 34:42.324
Not this time.

34:44.745 --> 34:45.945
Is that what I said to you
on Hazelton?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.663
That was
a long time ago.

34:47.748 --> 34:49.916
We're not at the D.A.'s office
anymore.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.784
I didn't realize our bond
had an expiration date.

34:52.835 --> 34:54.620
It doesn't, but...

34:54.670 --> 34:57.890
you want to deal on this,
I need jail time.

34:59.843 --> 35:01.094
You're running for office?

35:01.145 --> 35:02.562
What if I am?

35:02.629 --> 35:05.231
You need a scalp.

35:05.298 --> 35:06.732
I can think of four people
off the top of my head

35:06.800 --> 35:08.280
that make her look like
Mother Teresa.

35:08.301 --> 35:10.520
Harvey, I can't afford
to horse trade on this.

35:10.604 --> 35:11.604
You've done it before.

35:11.655 --> 35:13.606
And I'll do it again,
but...not today.

35:13.657 --> 35:16.359
Richard, you are singling out
this woman, and it's wrong.

35:17.661 --> 35:18.945
That's not my problem.

35:18.996 --> 35:20.363
What if I told you
I need this one?

35:20.447 --> 35:24.083
Then I'd have to tell you...
I'm sorry.

35:25.669 --> 35:27.203
Not gonna forget this.

35:27.287 --> 35:28.621
Harvey, look.

35:28.672 --> 35:31.257
If our bond can't survive
me telling you no,

35:31.324 --> 35:32.992
then...

35:33.043 --> 35:35.962
It didn't mean much
to begin with.

35:44.004 --> 35:47.306
- Hey, Rach.
- No time, code two!

35:47.357 --> 35:48.691
Richard Gere's
in the lobby?

35:48.775 --> 35:51.194
- Leaving now, let's go.
- Relax.

35:51.278 --> 35:54.197
We have trained for this.
Okay.

35:55.732 --> 35:57.683
Wait!

36:11.665 --> 36:13.866
Congratulations.

36:13.917 --> 36:17.369
Your writing implements
and nourishment of choice.

36:17.421 --> 36:18.554
Mm.

36:18.639 --> 36:22.558
Yeah, I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

36:22.643 --> 36:24.810
Please don't do this.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.896
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

36:26.980 --> 36:29.398
You're not gonna trick me into
letting you stay quartermaster

36:29.483 --> 36:30.933
just so you can take away
what's most dear to me

36:31.018 --> 36:33.402
little by little.

36:33.487 --> 36:37.106
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take it away all at once.

36:38.575 --> 36:39.992
What are you
talking about?

36:40.060 --> 36:42.862
I took you for a bylaws man.
It seems I was wrong.

36:42.913 --> 36:44.396
At Darby International,

36:44.448 --> 36:45.948
one cannot be in charge
of both the animate

36:46.033 --> 36:48.534
and the inanimate
at the same time.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.956
Your beloved associates
are mine.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.291
You set me up.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.709
What better way
to catch a rat

36:56.760 --> 36:58.461
than with
quartermaster cheese?

36:58.545 --> 36:59.762
What are you gonna do,

36:59.846 --> 37:02.882
beg Darby to undo
what you just begged him to do?

37:05.102 --> 37:07.687
Hold on.

37:07.754 --> 37:11.057
Nigel, the associates
are my life.

37:13.110 --> 37:14.426
So please don't do this.

37:14.478 --> 37:16.479
When I was
at preparatory school,

37:16.563 --> 37:19.232
like you,
I was bullied again and again.

37:19.283 --> 37:22.068
It was painful,
but I always saw them coming.

37:22.119 --> 37:23.602
But with you,
I didn't.

37:23.654 --> 37:26.989
So it wasn't a stab in the back,
it was a stab in the heart.

37:27.074 --> 37:29.742
And I just gave you
the opportunity to take it back,

37:29.793 --> 37:31.377
and you passed.

37:31.444 --> 37:35.665
So no, quartermaster Litt,
I won't forgive you.

37:41.305 --> 37:42.955
Nice office.

37:43.006 --> 37:44.724
Thanks.

37:44.791 --> 37:47.009
Do you mind
if I ask you a favor?

37:47.094 --> 37:48.177
Yeah, anything.

37:48.262 --> 37:49.979
I have
a ton of old files

37:50.063 --> 37:51.931
that I need organized
and shipped to storage,

37:51.982 --> 37:55.134
and I was wondering if you
could maybe do that for me.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.635
I

37:56.687 --> 37:58.154
Because I figured if you were
suddenly doing things for people

37:58.238 --> 38:00.106
that they don't need you to do,
didn't ask you to do,

38:00.157 --> 38:03.776
and don't want you to do,
then maybe I'd get in on that.

38:06.580 --> 38:09.749
I put that on Harvey's desk
for him, not you.

38:09.816 --> 38:12.034
Maybe.

38:12.119 --> 38:13.819
But I know
what you don't seem to get.

38:13.870 --> 38:16.655
Harvey didn't value you
for your help on cases.

38:16.707 --> 38:19.158
He valued you for your loyalty,
which he told you last night.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.376
Yeah, I know that.

38:20.460 --> 38:21.620
And I'm trying
to get it back,

38:21.628 --> 38:22.828
and this is
the only way I know how.

38:22.879 --> 38:24.163
By sending Rachel
to distract me

38:24.214 --> 38:25.631
and sneaking
into his office?

38:25.682 --> 38:27.300
Oh, by the way, you think
I don't know about you two?

38:27.351 --> 38:29.001
Took me one look.
Donna, come on.

38:29.052 --> 38:32.021
You wanna know how
to get Harvey's loyalty back?

38:32.105 --> 38:34.523
Get in a time machine and undo
what you did with Jessica.

38:34.608 --> 38:36.508
Oh, shoot,
you can't do that.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.111
You know what, I figured
you'd bring this file back.

38:39.179 --> 38:41.147
There's also one
in your bottom drawer.

38:41.198 --> 38:44.817
You might wanna grab that too.

38:44.868 --> 38:45.985
And just in case of that,

38:46.036 --> 38:48.738
I put seven other copies
in his office.

38:48.822 --> 38:50.289
'Cause whether
he forgives me or not,

38:50.357 --> 38:52.825
he's still gonna need it.

38:52.876 --> 38:55.161
Some random associate
gave him all that information

38:55.212 --> 38:57.713
on Ava Hessington?

38:57.798 --> 38:58.748
No way.

38:58.832 --> 39:01.300
It was Scottie.

39:01.368 --> 39:03.535
Yeah, I found the ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

39:03.587 --> 39:04.804
It's not a giant leap.

39:04.871 --> 39:07.506
The only problem is
Scottie's not here.

39:07.557 --> 39:08.924
She's in London.

39:09.009 --> 39:11.543
And Harvey--
he is still gonna need this.

39:11.595 --> 39:15.598
This file doesn't lead
to Harvey forgiving you.

39:15.682 --> 39:17.099
Donna...

39:17.184 --> 39:19.068
Please could you just separate
our relationship

39:19.152 --> 39:20.953
from yours and his
for just, like, one second?

39:20.987 --> 39:22.355
Are you kidding me?

39:22.406 --> 39:24.023
Do you think I'm mad
just because of him?

39:24.074 --> 39:25.991
You did this
to me too.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.526
And whether you appreciate it
or not,

39:27.577 --> 39:29.278
I've had your back
since the day that you got here.

39:29.363 --> 39:31.864
Yes. Yes, you have.
But what about last year?

39:31.915 --> 39:33.249
When I had your back,
you ignored me,

39:33.333 --> 39:35.000
and it almost cost him
his license.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.670
The difference is
I did what I did for him,

39:37.737 --> 39:39.255
not for me.

39:39.339 --> 39:41.407
And I didn't get
a brand-new office for it.

39:41.458 --> 39:43.676
I got fired.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.897
Yum.

39:54.965 --> 39:57.100
Oh, what do you want, Michael?
Please.

39:57.151 --> 39:58.634
I'm just trying to eat
my egg McMuffin

39:58.685 --> 39:59.936
while I'm still off-line,
okay?

39:59.987 --> 40:02.655
I thought
you were never off-line.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.691
Five minutes a day.

40:05.776 --> 40:07.193
Listen, Benjamin,

40:07.277 --> 40:09.946
I don't wanna hold what's
on this dictaphone over you

40:09.997 --> 40:11.114
for the rest
of your life.

40:11.165 --> 40:13.533
Why not?

40:13.617 --> 40:15.118
I don't need
any more enemies.

40:15.169 --> 40:17.453
I'd rather have a friend,
but...

40:17.504 --> 40:19.422
I do need a favor.

40:19.489 --> 40:21.124
And if I don't
give it to you,

40:21.175 --> 40:25.128
then what do you do
with the dictaphone?

40:25.179 --> 40:26.763
It's the only copy
there is.

40:26.830 --> 40:27.964
Go on, erase it.

40:28.015 --> 40:30.049
Then I'll ask you
my favor.

40:30.134 --> 40:32.935
How do I know
that this is the only copy?

40:33.003 --> 40:35.388
Because I'm giving you
my word.

40:40.644 --> 40:41.727
What do you need?

40:41.812 --> 40:45.982
I need you to build me
a time machine.

40:47.117 --> 40:49.402
And a bite
of the sandwich.

40:49.486 --> 40:52.021
Come on.
That's not sanitary, Michael.

40:52.072 --> 40:54.874
Come on,
just a little.

40:54.958 --> 40:57.794
You can have
the rest.

40:59.746 --> 41:01.530
- How did it go with Richard?
- It didn't.

41:01.582 --> 41:03.365
He didn't budge.
Why not?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.701
Says he's running for office,
but it doesn't make sense.

41:05.752 --> 41:08.504
Yeah, it does.

41:10.540 --> 41:12.208
Son of bitch!

41:12.259 --> 41:13.375
He looks me in the eye,

41:13.427 --> 41:14.827
and he feeds me
a bullshit sandwich.

41:14.878 --> 41:16.879
He's obviously not
the same man he used to be.

41:16.930 --> 41:19.148
Yeah, well, I am.

41:19.216 --> 41:21.184
Wait a second.
Let me guess. Mike?

41:21.235 --> 41:22.435
Just because you use it

41:22.519 --> 41:23.552
doesn't mean you have
to forgive him.

41:23.604 --> 41:25.554
You're right.
I don't.

41:33.664 --> 41:35.898
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

41:35.949 --> 41:38.234
Hessington Oil's
number one competitor

41:38.285 --> 41:41.170
also happens to be your biggest
campaign contributor?

41:41.238 --> 41:42.455
Which has nothing to do
with the fact

41:42.539 --> 41:43.623
that your client
broke the law.

41:43.707 --> 41:44.907
You don't want a deal.

41:44.958 --> 41:47.009
What you want
is a long, drawn-out trial

41:47.077 --> 41:49.011
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

41:49.079 --> 41:51.214
You think I wasn't
gonna find that out?

41:51.265 --> 41:52.598
I mean,
I gotta hand it to you.

41:52.683 --> 41:53.749
You set it up perfectly

41:53.800 --> 41:55.017
to shield yourself
from prosecution.

41:55.085 --> 41:57.854
To shield myself
from breaking the law.

41:57.921 --> 42:00.273
Prosecuting the competition.

42:00.357 --> 42:02.024
It's a hell
of a campaign slogan.

42:02.092 --> 42:04.977
Harvey,
your client did this.

42:05.062 --> 42:06.929
I'm not going
after an innocent person.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.781
And you know
that if I win this election,

42:08.866 --> 42:10.316
I will do good things.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.535
You know what, you sound
just like Cameron Dennis.

42:12.602 --> 42:13.819
You remember?

42:13.904 --> 42:16.205
Always a reason,
always out for the greater good.

42:16.273 --> 42:18.491
But in the end,
it's all about him.

42:18.575 --> 42:20.660
Look, I've never claimed
to be out for the greater good.

42:20.744 --> 42:23.579
So cut me a deal
and find yourself another donor.

42:23.630 --> 42:26.749
Harvey, it's too late.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.385
Please.
I need this.

42:30.620 --> 42:34.340
Well, that's not
my problem.

42:35.458 --> 42:38.311
Send Carolyn my love.

42:41.815 --> 42:43.149
You wanted to see me?

42:43.233 --> 42:46.018
I know why you care so much
about Ava Hessington.

42:46.103 --> 42:47.069
Well, it's no secret.

42:47.137 --> 42:48.738
Her father
was my first client.

42:48.805 --> 42:53.409
I think he was
a little bit more than that.

42:53.476 --> 42:54.977
It was a different time.

42:55.028 --> 42:57.363
Does she know?

42:57.447 --> 42:59.999
She knows
that I care about her.

43:00.083 --> 43:01.924
I'm sorry, was there
something else you wanted?

43:01.952 --> 43:03.169
Just to let you know
that if I could figure that out,

43:03.253 --> 43:04.870
Harvey can figure that out.

43:04.955 --> 43:06.622
And why would that
be a problem?

43:06.673 --> 43:08.124
Because it's one thing
for Harvey to know

43:08.175 --> 43:09.625
that this case
is important to you,

43:09.676 --> 43:12.929
another to know
how important.

43:12.996 --> 43:15.514
Are you telling me
you don't trust him?

43:15.599 --> 43:16.933
I told you

43:17.000 --> 43:20.169
he's having a difficult time
digesting this merger.

43:20.220 --> 43:24.807
I don't want him using this
as leverage to leave.

43:24.858 --> 43:26.609
At the end of the day,

43:26.676 --> 43:29.946
I don't believe
Harvey really wants to leave.

43:31.448 --> 43:32.615
Harvey...

43:32.682 --> 43:33.899
What a coincidence.

43:33.984 --> 43:36.852
Cameron.
You grew the mustache back.

43:36.903 --> 43:38.738
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

43:38.822 --> 43:41.540
It wasn't a success
the first time.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.025
What are you doing here?

43:43.076 --> 43:44.794
Ah, Richard told me
that you mentioned me

43:44.861 --> 43:46.295
at your last meeting.

43:46.363 --> 43:49.131
It's funny,
'cause he called me

43:49.199 --> 43:51.700
after your first meeting,
wanted my advice.

43:51.752 --> 43:53.502
So I guess
you're here to tell me

43:53.553 --> 43:55.171
he's not gonna give me
a deal.

43:55.222 --> 43:57.206
I'm here to tell you he's
recusing himself from the case.

43:57.257 --> 43:59.175
He didn't want the appearance
of a conflict

43:59.226 --> 44:01.260
to damage the workings
of justice.

44:01.345 --> 44:03.212
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

44:03.263 --> 44:06.048
Lucky for me,
I've always been special.

44:06.099 --> 44:07.733
No, you've always been
a corrupt prick.

44:07.818 --> 44:09.518
It just took me a while
to realize it.

44:09.569 --> 44:11.053
And it took me a while
to realize

44:11.104 --> 44:13.356
that you don't have a speck
of loyalty in your entire body.

44:13.407 --> 44:16.325
Loyalty is a two-way street,
and you ran me off the road.

44:16.393 --> 44:18.244
So what
are you gonna do?

44:18.328 --> 44:20.413
You gonna let Jessica fight your
fight like you did last time,

44:20.497 --> 44:21.730
or you gonna run away

44:21.782 --> 44:23.032
like you did when you left
the D.A.'s office?

44:23.083 --> 44:25.034
Neither one, Cameron.
But thank you.

44:25.085 --> 44:26.702
For what?

44:26.753 --> 44:29.738
For reminding me
that I don't run from a fight.

44:32.742 --> 44:33.709
What was so important
that I had

44:33.760 --> 44:35.628
to come down here
right away?

44:35.712 --> 44:38.848
Don't tell me
you want a bigger office.

44:38.915 --> 44:40.683
You told me
that I can think of this office

44:40.750 --> 44:43.135
as a reminder
of what I did to Harvey

44:43.220 --> 44:46.639
or as a symbol
of what I can do at this firm.

44:46.723 --> 44:48.891
But the thing is
I don't wanna be here

44:48.942 --> 44:50.926
if I'm not solid
with Harvey.

44:50.977 --> 44:53.429
Well,
that's between you and Harvey.

44:53.480 --> 44:57.400
It's between you and me.

44:57.451 --> 45:00.236
You put yourself between us
when you blackmailed me.

45:00.287 --> 45:02.154
Well, the word
you're looking for is extortion,

45:02.239 --> 45:03.656
not blackmail,

45:03.740 --> 45:06.158
and I'm not going to comment
on that accusation.

45:06.243 --> 45:09.078
But as for your choices,

45:09.129 --> 45:11.113
you made those
all by yourself.

45:11.164 --> 45:12.415
So don't come crying
to me.

45:14.418 --> 45:16.952
This is a copy of the letter you
wrote to the district attorney

45:17.003 --> 45:19.338
when you threatened
to expose me.

45:19.423 --> 45:21.424
Expose you?
For what?

45:21.475 --> 45:22.755
I never wrote
a letter like that.

45:22.792 --> 45:25.227
I'm not recording you.

45:25.295 --> 45:26.679
I don't need
to record you.

45:26.763 --> 45:29.432
This letter was printed
from your hard drive,

45:29.483 --> 45:32.301
which has your computer's
digital signature.

45:35.689 --> 45:37.773
What do you want?

45:37.824 --> 45:39.275
I wanna know,
if you had the chance,

45:39.326 --> 45:40.642
would you have traded
that car

45:40.694 --> 45:42.111
to get your parents
back together?

45:43.313 --> 45:44.747
That's a stupid
goddamn question,

45:44.814 --> 45:46.031
and you know it.

45:46.116 --> 45:48.584
I never had that chance,
so what does it matter?

45:48.651 --> 45:51.003
Because I do.

45:51.088 --> 45:54.623
What do I want?

45:54.674 --> 45:56.876
I wanna give
this office back.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.462
I didn't earn it,
I don't want it,

45:59.513 --> 46:01.593
and if there's a chance
it'll help Harvey forgive me,

46:01.631 --> 46:03.599
I'm gonna take it.

46:07.104 --> 46:09.555
Oh, and, uh,

46:09.639 --> 46:12.775
if you ever do
send that letter,

46:12.842 --> 46:15.778
you're in the same boat
as me.

46:28.358 --> 46:30.192
Harvey,
you're looking determined.

46:30.243 --> 46:32.828
- I am.
- What can I do for you?

46:32.879 --> 46:35.881
Look, I know
we had an arrangement,

46:35.966 --> 46:37.216
but I came here
to change it.

46:37.300 --> 46:38.217
Change it?

46:38.301 --> 46:39.969
But you might not even win.

46:40.036 --> 46:42.638
I've just heard about
this new special prosecutor.

46:42.705 --> 46:44.840
Relax, the case
was always gonna be hard.

46:44.891 --> 46:46.142
It just got
a little harder.

46:46.209 --> 46:47.476
Because you made it
that way.

46:47.544 --> 46:48.811
That's my problem.

46:48.878 --> 46:51.013
And now you're using
that increased difficulty

46:51.064 --> 46:52.714
to renegotiate our deal.

46:52.766 --> 46:56.652
That's your problem.

46:56.719 --> 46:59.989
We both know
how important Ava is to you.

47:01.741 --> 47:02.775
What do you want?

47:02.859 --> 47:04.693
I don't wanna run
from a fight.

47:04.744 --> 47:06.328
Meaning?

47:06.396 --> 47:07.329
I win,

47:07.397 --> 47:09.865
you don't fire me,

47:09.916 --> 47:13.402
you back me
for managing partner.

47:13.453 --> 47:16.905
You want
to take down Jessica.

47:16.957 --> 47:18.697
Yes, I do.
