00:51.143 --> 00:53.100
No, I like-- my favorite thing
to do is sleep now.

00:53.213 --> 00:54.335
I love sleep.

00:54.448 --> 00:55.772
Sleep is like--
that's my thing.

00:55.885 --> 00:56.706
I love it.

00:56.819 --> 00:58.007
And my kids don't let me.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.975
They get me up at
6:00 in the morning.

01:00.088 --> 01:02.154
I don't have to get up
'til, like, 7:00 a.m.

01:02.267 --> 01:03.267
to get them to school.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.714
They wake up
at 6:00.

01:04.827 --> 01:08.151
They don't-- I don't
even understand this shit...

01:08.264 --> 01:11.720
with getting out of bed
before you have to.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.567
They wake up
and they're like...

01:15.436 --> 01:16.825
They're so excited
and they want to--

01:16.938 --> 01:18.526
I get it, they want to
share with me.

01:18.639 --> 01:20.707
"Daddy, look,
it's all still here !"

01:25.547 --> 01:28.204
That hurts my brain,
'cause at--

01:28.317 --> 01:29.640
at 6:00 a.m., I'm just--

01:29.753 --> 01:35.079
Uh, I'm so deep in the--
in the deep African sleep,

01:35.192 --> 01:39.051
like it's just an ancient,
mysterious,

01:39.164 --> 01:42.666
submerged in a river
of warm chocolate, just...

01:44.769 --> 01:46.658
Ahh...

01:46.771 --> 01:49.027
And sleep was like
a goddess whore

01:49.140 --> 01:50.673
just sucking me off, just...

01:52.042 --> 01:53.364
Ahh...

01:53.477 --> 01:55.878
She's got a gold helmet
and 40 tongues and she's--

02:00.784 --> 02:03.073
Ahh...

02:03.186 --> 02:04.842
And she's speaking in
a dead language.

02:04.955 --> 02:06.790
<i>Los stalica forgentila !</i>

02:08.259 --> 02:10.682
<i>Seiz deleca porgentila !</i>

02:10.795 --> 02:13.085
Ahh...

02:13.198 --> 02:14.954
And she's feeding syrupy heroin

02:15.067 --> 02:16.801
into my penis
while she's sucking--

02:17.871 --> 02:19.993
<i>For stalica forgentila !</i>

02:20.106 --> 02:21.595
Uh, let this be my life!

02:21.708 --> 02:23.430
Please let this
be real, let this be real.

02:23.543 --> 02:24.331
"Daddy !"

02:24.444 --> 02:26.400
No, oh, shit!

02:26.513 --> 02:27.947
"Daddy, wake up !"

02:35.224 --> 02:36.479
Thanks a lot, folks,
good night.

02:36.592 --> 02:37.592
Thank you very much.

02:51.509 --> 02:53.032
Hey, good set.

02:56.181 --> 02:59.238
but they sounded
happy through the door.

02:59.351 --> 03:00.651
Yeah, thank you.

03:02.421 --> 03:03.909
Hey, man, good set.

03:04.022 --> 03:05.244
Hey, how's it going?
All right.

03:05.357 --> 03:06.479
This is my agent, Doug.

03:06.592 --> 03:07.813
This is Steven.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.248
Nice to meet you, big fan.

03:09.361 --> 03:10.561
Thank you.

03:12.697 --> 03:15.287
See you later, man.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.888
Wait, you leaving?

03:17.001 --> 03:18.924
Yeah, I gotta--

03:19.037 --> 03:20.458
Why, what?

03:20.571 --> 03:21.960
After a set like that,

03:22.073 --> 03:24.062
you gotta hang out
and get laid.

03:24.175 --> 03:26.098
I haven't done that
since I was, like, 20.

03:26.211 --> 03:27.366
I got kids.

03:27.479 --> 03:28.801
I gotta go home and
pick 'em up in the morning.

03:28.914 --> 03:31.304
That's a complete waste.

03:31.417 --> 03:32.505
Is that what you do?

03:32.618 --> 03:34.107
You hang out after shows
and pick up girls?

03:34.220 --> 03:35.342
Heck no.

03:35.455 --> 03:36.877
I have a family.

03:36.990 --> 03:38.946
I have a wife and two kids

03:39.059 --> 03:42.117
and I'm taking them to
Six Flags in the morning.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.987
But you need to stay here
and get some tail.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.588
After a set like that,

03:46.701 --> 03:49.258
you own every woman
in that place.

03:49.371 --> 03:51.427
You can have anyone you want,

03:51.540 --> 03:53.208
so you need to stay here.

03:55.011 --> 03:59.103
Now just sit down,
goddamn it, and wait.

03:59.216 --> 04:00.883
Don't be an asshole.

04:08.325 --> 04:10.080
Can I get a shot?

04:10.193 --> 04:12.182
A shot of what?

04:12.295 --> 04:13.350
Whiskey.

04:13.463 --> 04:14.517
What kind of whiskey?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.219
Just, please, a brown liquid

04:16.332 --> 04:18.421
that makes people feel
differently than

04:18.534 --> 04:19.534
if they didn't drink it.

04:46.994 --> 04:48.149
Hey.

04:48.262 --> 04:49.350
That was a really good set.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.785
Thank you.

04:50.898 --> 04:52.753
I know, I was watching you
all night inside.

04:52.866 --> 04:54.488
It was really, really good.
Really, thank-- That's--

04:54.601 --> 04:55.890
Really, really,
really good new stuff.

04:56.003 --> 04:58.860
Thank you, that's nice that
you were watching, that's...

04:58.973 --> 05:00.495
Thanks a lot.

05:00.608 --> 05:02.430
Do you have new head shots?

05:02.543 --> 05:03.598
Excuse me?

05:03.711 --> 05:05.433
I need new head shots
for the website,

05:05.546 --> 05:08.803
- because I only have the ones
from when you were younger. - Sure.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.815
Can you have those sent to the office?
Yes, I'll do that, the...

05:10.928 --> 05:11.929
Yup.

05:12.042 --> 05:13.152
Thank you.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.581
I know.

05:20.694 --> 05:21.849
It was amazing, right?

05:21.962 --> 05:23.510
It was amazing, but it was
a very long day.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.624
Oh, it was, it was...

05:24.737 --> 05:25.920
15 hours.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.855
But, still, we had
a good time, right?

05:27.968 --> 05:29.669
I know, I know,
it was wonderful.

06:24.329 --> 06:25.562
Hello.

06:32.336 --> 06:33.403
Hello?

06:37.941 --> 06:39.207
Hi.

06:42.244 --> 06:43.900
The show was terrific.

06:44.013 --> 06:45.780
Oh, you were at--you were at the show?
Yes.

06:48.176 --> 06:49.177
Thank you.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.439
Thanks very much.

06:50.552 --> 06:51.941
I've just been
sitting out here,

06:52.054 --> 06:53.521
hoping you would come out.

06:56.893 --> 06:58.527
Why were you doing that?

07:00.096 --> 07:01.663
Because I wanna
show you my pussy.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.728
Well...

07:09.841 --> 07:11.730
that's--
that's very nice.

07:11.843 --> 07:13.344
I'm glad you enjoyed the show.

07:57.723 --> 07:59.445
So what is--
what's your name?

07:59.558 --> 08:01.159
My name is Eunice.

08:03.028 --> 08:04.783
Eunice.

08:04.896 --> 08:06.518
Where are we going?

08:06.631 --> 08:07.986
My house.

08:08.099 --> 08:09.798
Your house?

08:09.911 --> 08:10.911
You didn't want me to
show you my pussy

08:11.024 --> 08:12.824
in the street, did you?

08:12.937 --> 08:14.125
No, no, I didn't--

08:14.238 --> 08:16.794
I didn't want you
to show me my-- your--

08:16.907 --> 08:18.941
I didn't want you to
show you mou..

08:20.978 --> 08:22.633
It's just that I don't know you

08:22.746 --> 08:25.937
and it's a little weird to be
going to your home.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.385
Um, and I didn't-- I-- I--

08:50.175 --> 08:51.663
Are we going to New Jersey?

08:51.776 --> 08:54.199
Maybe.

08:54.312 --> 08:57.336
Listen, I-- I don't
know you

08:57.449 --> 08:58.737
and I guess
I feel a little funny,

08:58.850 --> 09:00.784
because I'm-- I'm in
the middle...

09:33.685 --> 09:35.841
This is--
this is a very nice house.

09:35.954 --> 09:38.155
Yes, well, we're very wealthy.

09:41.426 --> 09:43.182
Hello, darling.

09:43.295 --> 09:44.784
John, this is Louie.

09:44.897 --> 09:45.684
How do you do?

09:45.797 --> 09:47.152
Hello.

09:47.265 --> 09:48.999
Uh, you're--
Jonathan's my husband.

09:50.468 --> 09:52.935
Oh, this is, uh...

09:55.005 --> 09:57.394
I didn't know
that you had a--

09:57.507 --> 09:59.229
What did you tell him?

09:59.342 --> 10:00.696
I told him I wanted to
take him home

10:00.809 --> 10:03.499
and show him my pussy.

10:03.612 --> 10:05.468
Did she tell you that?

10:05.581 --> 10:07.102
Well...

10:07.215 --> 10:09.137
She said something
like that, yes, I--

10:09.250 --> 10:10.851
Well, great!

10:12.680 --> 10:13.681
Let's get started.

10:13.794 --> 10:15.077
Wait a minute,
hold on a second.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.211
What's the matter?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.446
You guys wanna
do this together as a--

10:18.559 --> 10:20.114
Well, she's my wife.

10:20.227 --> 10:22.116
Don't I get to see it, too?

10:22.229 --> 10:24.084
Yeah, but--
I-- I-- it's just that--

10:24.197 --> 10:25.252
Look.

10:25.365 --> 10:27.887
A man and a woman and me
together with a--

10:28.000 --> 10:30.390
I'm not--
I-- I-- I've never done--

10:30.503 --> 10:32.858
You got into the car,
you came here with me.

10:32.971 --> 10:35.961
Yeah, but I-- I thought
that we would be alone.

10:36.074 --> 10:37.823
And what right did you
have to assume that?

10:37.936 --> 10:38.937
Yes.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.211
What right did you have?

10:42.848 --> 10:44.637
Do you guys do this
all the time?

10:44.750 --> 10:46.238
Well, that's a bit of
none of your business.

10:46.351 --> 10:48.274
Listen, John, I saw your show,

10:48.387 --> 10:50.009
I thought you were
very talented,

10:50.122 --> 10:52.578
that really...
turned me on,

10:52.691 --> 10:54.813
and I though it
might be nice to share you

10:54.926 --> 10:56.515
with my husband.

10:56.628 --> 11:00.019
Listen, whatever you guys
are into, that's fine.

11:00.132 --> 11:01.387
I just--
I think I better go.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.967
What's the matter,
you don't like my wife?

11:04.603 --> 11:06.059
You're too good for her?

11:06.172 --> 11:06.859
No.
Huh?

11:06.972 --> 11:09.028
She's great, I just--

11:09.141 --> 11:10.596
I have kids, I gotta pick 'em up
in the morning,

11:10.709 --> 11:12.043
and I-- I didn't...

11:13.412 --> 11:14.534
Well go on, then.

11:14.647 --> 11:16.113
Get out of here.

11:18.751 --> 11:20.874
Can you drive me back
to the city?

11:20.987 --> 11:22.509
Well, I really don't
wanna go back out.

11:22.622 --> 11:23.976
We have to be up early.

11:24.089 --> 11:25.611
The children have
soccer tomorrow.

11:25.724 --> 11:27.914
It's the playoffs.

11:28.027 --> 11:29.148
Can you call me a cab,

11:29.261 --> 11:30.850
'cause I don't even know
where I am right now.

11:30.963 --> 11:33.386
I think you better go, buddy.

11:33.499 --> 11:35.255
I think you better leave.

11:35.368 --> 11:36.568
Now!

12:26.185 --> 12:27.239
Hello?

12:27.352 --> 12:29.731
Hey, man, listen, I'm...

12:30.053 --> 12:31.854
I'm stranded out in the middle
of New Jersey somewhere.

12:33.156 --> 12:34.177
What?

12:34.290 --> 12:35.378
Who's that?

12:35.491 --> 12:36.746
It's Louie.

12:36.859 --> 12:39.482
I got into a weird thing with
some woman and I don't--

12:39.595 --> 12:41.451
I don't know where I am,
but could you come get me?

12:41.564 --> 12:43.419
I think I'm near you.

12:43.695 --> 12:45.251
Okay, so you don't
know where you are

12:45.364 --> 12:47.186
but you want me to come
and get you?

12:47.299 --> 12:48.921
You're not going anywhere.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.423
<i>Well, I'm stranded</i> <i>out here.</i>

12:51.536 --> 12:53.091
And that just
became my problem.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.592
There's no street signs.

12:54.705 --> 12:56.294
I have no idea how to
find anyplace.

12:56.407 --> 12:57.595
I've been
walking for ten minutes.

12:57.708 --> 12:59.264
You got GPS on your phone?

12:59.377 --> 13:01.432
I don't know, I--

13:01.545 --> 13:02.834
You got GPS on your phone.

13:02.947 --> 13:05.069
Anyway, hang up, look up
where you are

13:05.182 --> 13:06.337
and I'll come
and get you, okay?

13:06.450 --> 13:08.005
Okay.

13:08.118 --> 13:09.406
Bye.

13:09.519 --> 13:10.974
You're not going anywhere.

13:11.087 --> 13:13.944
I told you to stop being friends
with him when he got divorced.

13:14.057 --> 13:15.678
You can't
trust divorced people.

13:15.791 --> 13:16.958
They ruin their lives
and now they wanna--

13:19.495 --> 13:20.884
So you just jumped in
a woman's car,

13:20.997 --> 13:22.520
just like that?

13:22.633 --> 13:24.055
Well, she said
she was gonna--

13:24.168 --> 13:25.490
Show you her pussy.

13:25.603 --> 13:28.727
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's real smart, Louie.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.428
So now my wife's mad at me

13:30.541 --> 13:32.030
and I'm driving you around
at 2:00 in the morning.

13:32.143 --> 13:33.331
I'm soy, okay?

13:33.444 --> 13:35.500
I said I'm sorry.

13:35.613 --> 13:37.369
Just please take me home, okay?

13:37.482 --> 13:38.838
I'm not taking you home.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.173
I'll take you to my place,
you'll spend the night.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.041
No, I can't, I gotta pick up
my kids in the morning.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.776
Oh, God.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.144
All right, you know what?

13:45.257 --> 13:46.813
You'll come back to my place,

13:46.926 --> 13:48.681
you'll call a cab, they'll pick you up, okay?
Okay.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.150
All right, all right.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.419
I'm not taking you to the city
at 2:00 in the morning

13:52.532 --> 13:53.553
'cause you had to look at

13:53.666 --> 13:55.122
some crazy woman's vagina.
Okay.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.157
That's not how I plan my life, okay?
I-- I get it.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.726
All right.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.273
I'm sorry and thank you.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.264
Gotta grow up, man.
Thank you and I'm sorry.

14:03.377 --> 14:05.033
Okay, okay!

14:05.146 --> 14:07.735
Next time, find a vagina
in New York, okay?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.405
She was in New York.

14:10.518 --> 14:11.807
Well, that lives in New York.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.275
I didn't know,
I didn't ask her--

14:13.388 --> 14:14.604
Somebody says, "I wanna
show you my pussy,"

14:14.717 --> 14:15.717
I don't ask 'em where--

14:15.830 --> 14:17.380
Do you live in this area code?

14:17.493 --> 14:18.760
Well, you should.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.586
Thank you.

14:23.699 --> 14:24.920
Thanks, baby.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.456
Coming to my house, 2:00.

14:27.569 --> 14:29.057
What are you doing, man?

14:29.170 --> 14:31.560
Goddamn.
Doing what?

14:31.673 --> 14:33.574
With your life,
what are you doing?

14:35.977 --> 14:38.800
You're a father, Louie.

14:38.913 --> 14:42.148
Jumping into cars, messing
around with swingers.

14:44.585 --> 14:47.776
This is 30-year-old shit,
it's not 40-year-old shit.

14:47.889 --> 14:49.622
Come on, man, when are you
gonna grow up?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.914
When are you gonna settle down?

14:54.027 --> 14:54.648
Settle down?

14:54.761 --> 14:55.816
I'm divorced.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.419
Yeah, well,
you still gotta grow up.

14:58.532 --> 15:01.056
You got out of your marriage,
good for you.

15:01.169 --> 15:02.224
But look at you, man.

15:02.337 --> 15:05.360
You're getting into cars
with crazy people,

15:05.473 --> 15:07.662
you gotta take care of
your kids in the morning.

15:07.775 --> 15:09.765
Where is this headed?

15:09.878 --> 15:11.033
I don't know.

15:11.146 --> 15:13.002
Well, you're 43,
you should know.

15:13.115 --> 15:14.403
Where are you headed?
Where am I headed?

15:14.516 --> 15:16.339
I ain't headed nowhere,
I'm right here.

15:16.452 --> 15:18.574
In my house,
with my wife, with my kids,

15:18.687 --> 15:19.775
for better or worse--

15:19.888 --> 15:24.145
Worse most of the time,
but I'm here, okay?

15:24.258 --> 15:26.681
I'm not in the wrong state,

15:26.794 --> 15:29.950
calling up your wife,
pissing people off,

15:30.063 --> 15:33.653
having you come and pick me up
like some drunken teenager.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.022
Okay, I feel appropriately shitty.
Good.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.224
Yes, thank you.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.425
You are a lot better than I am.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.793
Damn right he is.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.329
He's ten times the man you are.

15:41.442 --> 15:42.530
Stop it.

15:42.643 --> 15:43.965
Don't tell me when I can talk.

15:44.078 --> 15:45.500
It's not your conversation.

15:45.613 --> 15:47.770
It is when it's in my house!

15:47.883 --> 15:50.718
And tell your fat friend that
this is my house, not his.

15:52.187 --> 15:54.811
I just want to ask you,
have you ever done something

15:54.924 --> 15:58.314
or lived a moment that
you, afterwards, said,

15:58.427 --> 16:00.494
"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna
tell anybody about that"?

16:04.099 --> 16:06.333
"Yeah, that's going to my
grave with me, that one is."

16:08.769 --> 16:10.124
Either because you're--

16:10.237 --> 16:13.727
It's stupid,
embarrassing or horrible.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.896
You just think, yeah,
that's staying with me.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.931
That's-- I'm not telling any
people about that.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.767
I would say that
probably 40% of my life

16:19.880 --> 16:21.635
is made up of moments
like that.

16:21.748 --> 16:22.515
So...

16:33.685 --> 16:35.775
Wee here so early.

16:35.888 --> 16:38.845
Well, it's good to get
here early, because--

16:38.958 --> 16:40.327
Can I smoke in your car?

16:40.447 --> 16:41.660
Please don't.

16:49.769 --> 16:51.002
Can I have one?

16:55.487 --> 16:56.554
Thank you.

17:06.798 --> 17:08.499
So why-- why are you
going to Paris?

17:11.436 --> 17:13.491
Serge's dad sent for him
two weeks ago

17:13.604 --> 17:16.194
and he's been there two weeks.

17:16.307 --> 17:18.997
I guess they bonded and...

17:19.110 --> 17:21.299
he wants to be with him.

17:21.412 --> 17:23.202
Who wants to be with which?

17:23.315 --> 17:24.570
Both.

17:24.683 --> 17:27.106
They both want to be together.

17:27.219 --> 17:29.576
A month ago, Serge never even
mentioned he had a dad,

17:29.689 --> 17:31.410
his dad never called,
everything was fine,

17:31.523 --> 17:33.045
now they're in Paris
and, all of a sudden,

17:33.158 --> 17:36.382
they give a shit about
each other.

17:36.495 --> 17:39.318
So you're going for what?

17:39.431 --> 17:41.655
Why are you...

17:41.768 --> 17:45.559
I'm going to give it a shot.

17:45.672 --> 17:48.296
Give what a shot?

17:48.409 --> 17:49.597
I don't know, man.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.132
Don't ask me.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.802
I'm going.

17:53.915 --> 17:55.938
But, so--
how long are you--

17:56.051 --> 17:57.540
I'm gonna check in
and drink at the gate.

17:57.653 --> 17:58.653
Okay.

18:01.991 --> 18:04.948
So how... long
are you going for?

18:05.061 --> 18:06.883
Thanks for driving me here,
by the way.

18:06.996 --> 18:08.318
That was nice.

18:08.431 --> 18:09.852
Sure, but, so how--

18:09.965 --> 18:11.666
When are you coming back?

18:17.205 --> 18:18.260
Can I help you?

18:18.373 --> 18:20.494
Yes, I'm going to Paris.

18:20.607 --> 18:21.974
Okay, passport, please.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.998
Thank you.

18:25.111 --> 18:26.366
Can I have your passport, too?

18:26.479 --> 18:27.801
- I'm-- I'm not going.
- Just me. - All right.

18:27.914 --> 18:30.170
Okay.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.604
Do you mind taking one of
those bags off, please?

18:31.717 --> 18:33.673
I'm sorry.
Thanks.

18:33.786 --> 18:36.809
All right.

18:36.922 --> 18:37.977
Got your--

18:38.090 --> 18:40.258
What's your return--
what's the return?

18:46.898 --> 18:48.399
But so when are you--
when are you...

18:49.768 --> 18:50.823
When are you coming?

18:50.936 --> 18:52.070
Okay.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.534
Listen, here's the deal.

19:00.647 --> 19:03.437
I'm going to Paris

19:03.550 --> 19:06.306
to make it work
with my kid's dad

19:06.419 --> 19:08.074
and I'm not coming back.

19:08.187 --> 19:09.876
You understand?

19:09.989 --> 19:11.644
I'm going there.
Well...

19:11.757 --> 19:14.425
Okay, here's the thing.

19:17.963 --> 19:20.752
You gotta move on, dude.

19:20.865 --> 19:23.055
I mean, I-- I don't think
I'm being arrogant

19:23.168 --> 19:25.191
by saying that
regardless of the fact

19:25.304 --> 19:26.325
that I've done nothing

19:26.438 --> 19:27.760
but let you know
there's no shot in hell

19:27.873 --> 19:30.529
of you ever being with me,

19:30.642 --> 19:33.967
you still got all your hopes
pinned on me, am I right?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.781
Yeah.
Right.

19:37.117 --> 19:38.606
So what I'm saying to you

19:38.719 --> 19:42.244
right here and now
in this airport is,

19:42.357 --> 19:44.479
stop doing that.

19:44.592 --> 19:47.315
You gotta move on,
I'm going to Europe.

19:47.428 --> 19:50.018
Yeah, but you might come back.

19:50.131 --> 19:51.252
Louie.

19:51.365 --> 19:53.455
Look, I know
the chances are slim,

19:53.568 --> 19:56.392
but I-- I think we're supposed
to be together.

19:56.505 --> 19:58.687
Jesus.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.801
Come on, man.

19:59.914 --> 20:02.198
I'm not attracted to you.

20:02.311 --> 20:04.935
Why do you keep making me
say mean things to you?

20:05.048 --> 20:06.970
I'm just saying,
this guy is a piece of shit.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.405
I know that.

20:08.518 --> 20:10.674
He left you and he left the kid

20:10.787 --> 20:12.876
and now he has a whim to be
a family again

20:12.989 --> 20:14.611
and I'm, frankly,
a little shocked.

20:14.724 --> 20:16.207
What, what?

20:16.320 --> 20:17.320
That--
What?

20:17.433 --> 20:19.017
You're really strong.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.219
You're tough
and you're no bullshit

20:21.332 --> 20:23.221
and here you're tailing
after this guy?

20:23.334 --> 20:24.455
Stop it.

20:24.568 --> 20:27.291
Okay, maybe you're not
attracted to me.

20:27.404 --> 20:30.227
No, no, not maybe.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.995
I am not.

20:32.108 --> 20:34.631
I have a hard time believing
that I feel this way

20:34.744 --> 20:36.365
and that there's
nothing coming back.

20:36.478 --> 20:38.279
I think you're just
not aware of it yet.

20:40.715 --> 20:41.904
Oh, God.

20:42.017 --> 20:44.707
Louie, come here.

20:44.820 --> 20:46.654
Oh...

20:48.224 --> 20:50.913
You're the most ( bleep )
person I ever knew.

20:51.026 --> 20:53.750
I love you... I do,

20:53.863 --> 20:56.186
but you gotta move on.

20:56.299 --> 20:57.887
You gotta move on.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.791
Forget about me, now.

21:00.904 --> 21:02.826
I get it, I know what's
going on here, okay?

21:02.939 --> 21:04.194
I'm not stupid.

21:04.307 --> 21:05.595
It's just that--

21:05.708 --> 21:08.431
You don't meet somebody like
you every day, and I just--

21:08.544 --> 21:10.567
I think I'm gonna wait.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.368
Don't.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.404
It's my choice,
I can if I want to.

21:14.517 --> 21:15.805
No, don't.

21:15.918 --> 21:17.140
You can't tell me not to.

21:17.253 --> 21:18.586
If I wanna do it,
I'll wait, I'm gonna wait.

21:21.157 --> 21:23.612
I gotta go, dude.

21:23.725 --> 21:26.883
It has not been a bummer
knowing you.

21:26.996 --> 21:28.284
I will say that.

21:28.397 --> 21:29.797
Thanks.

21:31.366 --> 21:33.389
You're a good guy.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.659
You're a good dad.

21:36.772 --> 21:38.460
And you're a good friend
to someone

21:38.573 --> 21:43.466
who you have an
unhealthy obsession with.

21:43.579 --> 21:45.480
But just...

21:47.282 --> 21:50.072
You gotta give yourself
a break, okay?

21:50.185 --> 21:51.841
You're really going,
aren't you?

21:51.954 --> 21:53.888
Yes, Louie, I'm going.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
Oh, shit.

21:58.833 --> 21:59.881
Okay, really?

21:59.994 --> 22:01.951
Really now--
now it's bye.

22:02.064 --> 22:03.130
Bye.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.267
Hi.

22:08.737 --> 22:09.904
Thank you.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.051
<i>Go, passengers, down to one.</i>

22:41.370 --> 22:42.604
<i>Go down to two.</i>

23:45.836 --> 23:47.170
Wave to me, dummy.

23:50.374 --> 23:51.574
Wave to me!

23:54.044 --> 23:56.200
Wave to me!

23:56.313 --> 23:58.002
What ?!

23:58.115 --> 24:00.149
Wave to me!

24:01.952 --> 24:03.541
What ?!

24:03.654 --> 24:04.942
Oh, Jesus.

24:05.055 --> 24:07.912
Wave to me, wave to me!

24:08.025 --> 24:10.481
Wait for you ?!

24:10.594 --> 24:12.350
What ?!

24:12.463 --> 24:13.818
Wait for you?

24:13.931 --> 24:15.786
Wave to me!

24:15.899 --> 24:17.855
Wait--
wait for you?

24:17.968 --> 24:19.524
<i>... Flight 1760...</i>

24:19.637 --> 24:21.793
You said--
you said wait for you?

24:21.906 --> 24:24.563
Yeah, wave to me!

24:24.676 --> 24:27.566
I will, I'll wait for you!

24:27.679 --> 24:29.735
I'll wait for you!

24:29.848 --> 24:32.804
Pamela, I will wait for you!

24:32.917 --> 24:34.506
I...

24:34.619 --> 24:37.342
I will wait for you!

24:37.455 --> 24:39.311
Pamela!

24:39.424 --> 24:42.014
I will wait for you!

24:42.127 --> 24:43.894
I'll wait for you!
