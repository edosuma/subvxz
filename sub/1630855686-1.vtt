WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:08.509
<i>The Dark One
is waking.</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.636
<i>His whispers are already
in the backs of our minds.</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:14.014
<i>But there will be one
who can stand against him.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:17.560
The Dragon has been born again.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.104
- And it's one of you.
- You've fully lost your mind.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.147
<i>I've heard about the bond</i>

00:21.147 --> 00:22.690
<i>between an Aes Sedai
and their Warder.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.525
<i>That you feel what she feels.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:26.026
It could be warmer.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.905
<i>- Better?
- Much.</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:31.240
Before you,

00:31.240 --> 00:34.034
I had nothing to live for
and nothing to die for.

00:35.453 --> 00:38.581
<i>This power,
it's meant for women.</i>

00:38.581 --> 00:39.957
<i>And women alone.</i>

00:39.957 --> 00:41.917
And when you touch it,

00:41.917 --> 00:44.545
you make it filthy.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.213
The Dark One corrupted
the One Power

00:46.213 --> 00:49.800
<i>so men couldn't use it
without going mad.</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:51.635
<i>You have
to watch him.</i>

00:51.635 --> 00:53.763
<i>I've healed him of his
connection to the dagger,</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:56.223
<i>but it was feeding off
the darkness in him</i>

00:56.223 --> 00:57.558
<i>as much as he was of it.</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.935
<i>If he touches it again,
he may be lost forever.</i>

01:00.895 --> 01:01.854
<i>I'm worried about him.</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:04.064
<i>His eyes
when Valda was torturing him.</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:05.649
<i>They went golden, like a wolf's.</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:08.152
<i>I'm no Aes Sedai,
but you could be.</i>

01:08.152 --> 01:10.196
<i>You don't listen to the wind, Egwene.</i>

01:10.196 --> 01:12.573
It's the wind
that listens to you.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.367
<i>The most
powerful channeler</i>

01:15.367 --> 01:17.536
<i>we've seen in 1,000 years.</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:19.872
<i>If I'm as powerful
as you say I am,</i>

01:19.872 --> 01:23.167
maybe it's you, Aes Sedai,
who shouldn't underestimate me.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.336
The Wheel
calls you to this,

01:25.336 --> 01:27.046
whether you can bear it or not.

01:27.046 --> 01:29.173
The Last Battle is coming.

01:36.222 --> 01:37.598
<i>What is it?</i>

01:37.598 --> 01:38.933
<i>The Horn of Valere.</i>

01:38.933 --> 01:40.142
<i>To be blown
at the Last Battle.</i>

01:41.519 --> 01:43.354
<i>There are Darkfriends
inside our walls.</i>

01:43.354 --> 01:45.648
<i>If we do not stop
the Dark One now</i>

01:45.648 --> 01:47.066
<i>while he is still weak,</i>

01:47.066 --> 01:49.610
<i>the whole world
will turn to darkness.</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:52.321
Mat!

01:52.321 --> 01:53.989
<i>I need a message
delivered to the Tower.</i>

01:53.989 --> 01:56.534
<i>There is a man
that they must find.</i>

01:56.534 --> 01:57.952
<i>Mat Cauthon.</i>

01:57.952 --> 01:59.703
<i>To whom
should I send this message?</i>

01:59.703 --> 02:00.955
<i>The Red Ajah.</i>

02:00.955 --> 02:03.123
<i>Moiraine masked our bond.</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:04.291
Rand.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.837
You cannot escape
your fate.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.047
You are the Dragon Reborn.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.465
<i>It was here.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.300
<i>In the center.</i>

02:13.300 --> 02:14.552
Egwene.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.053
<i>I felt it.</i>

02:16.053 --> 02:17.638
<i>The madness.</i>

02:17.638 --> 02:18.722
Tell them I died here.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.558
<i>Tell them I didn't make it back.</i>

02:20.558 --> 02:21.559
Where's Rand?

02:21.559 --> 02:22.810
He's gone.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.105
Unmask the bond.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.190
<i>I can't touch</i>

02:28.190 --> 02:29.567
the Source.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.069
<i>It's cuendillar.</i>

02:32.069 --> 02:33.112
<i>I thought that heartstone</i>

02:33.112 --> 02:34.238
<i>couldn't be scratched.</i>

02:35.239 --> 02:36.448
<i>Not even the One Power
could break it.</i>

02:37.616 --> 02:38.534
<i>So did I.</i>

02:38.534 --> 02:39.618
What does it mean?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.203
That this wasn't
the Last Battle.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.457
<i>I fear it was the first.</i>

04:01.075 --> 04:03.661
Where is he now,
the one who walks the world,

04:03.661 --> 04:06.455
the one who was and will be

04:06.455 --> 04:09.458
but is not yet the Dragon,

04:09.458 --> 04:10.876
Rand al'Thor?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.878
He released me
at the Eye of the World,

04:12.878 --> 04:15.631
and he thinks he can hide.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.383
He cannot.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.759
We are to kill him?

04:18.759 --> 04:22.388
Perhaps he can
be turned to my use.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.974
Sooner or later,
it will be served,

04:24.974 --> 04:26.684
in this age or another.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.227
Mum.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.604
Excuse me.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.816
We're in the middle
of a meeting.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.526
A quite important one, really.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.446
Oh.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.281
Let me guess.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.533
There's something outside.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.036
A monster, perhaps?

04:49.999 --> 04:51.458
Come on.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.549
A lot of people call me
a monster, too, you know.

04:58.549 --> 05:03.053
Along with a litany
of other unflattering names.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.596
Father of Lies.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.557
Betrayer of Hope.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.767
Forsaken.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.061
Do you know why they call me
and the other Chosen

05:11.061 --> 05:12.521
such hideous things?

05:12.521 --> 05:13.772
No.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.025
'Cause if they called me
what I really am,

05:16.025 --> 05:17.526
no one would be afraid.

05:27.036 --> 05:30.497
After all, how do you prove
you're not a monster?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.667
How do you prove that the things
you're doing are good or evil?

05:35.127 --> 05:36.587
Right or wrong?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.758
Look at this creature.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.092
Part man.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.012
Part animal.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.265
It's so hard
to be something between.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.437
What if he isn't evil?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.648
What if he isn't wrong?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.650
What if he's just...

05:58.650 --> 05:59.693
hungry?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.408
Look at me.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.329
Do I look like a monster to you?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.041
No.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.337
I knew I liked you.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.555
You see?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.307
It's all right.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.850
Go on.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.685
You try.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.397
You're late.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.025
Verin. Must you speak so loudly?

10:50.025 --> 10:52.235
Are you hungover?

10:52.235 --> 10:54.946
I'm speaking
at a perfectly normal volume.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.741
Could you move to the left
a little?

10:57.741 --> 11:00.118
Perfect.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.328
Mm.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.413
Lan!

11:03.413 --> 11:05.540
You know, it is so warm today,

11:05.540 --> 11:07.918
and it must be unbearable
swinging your sword

11:07.918 --> 11:11.463
wearing
such heavy woolen trousers.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.006
A rider's coming.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.926
Another one of her visitors, hmm?

11:15.926 --> 11:17.052
Must be.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.013
- That's 20.
- Mm.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.890
Still no word from Moiraine
about who they are,

11:21.890 --> 11:23.225
what news they bring?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.727
Don't look at me.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.687
She doesn't tell me any more
than she tells you.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.441
Mm-hmm?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.994
Another visitor is here for you.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.579
Send him in.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.083
This one is from Illian.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.585
Send him in.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.555
Moiraine Sedai.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.348
Come.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.392
Sit.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.893
My customers
usually do be coming to me,

12:06.893 --> 12:09.146
not the other way round.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.148
Especially this far
from a good harbor.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.691
And yet here you are.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.651
I didn't have much of a choice,
did I?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.654
Oh, everyone has a choice,
Master Domon.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.866
And every choice has
a consequence.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.076
Door.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.459
Now...

12:31.626 --> 12:32.586
...if you're done posturing,

12:32.586 --> 12:34.629
I believe we have business
to attend to.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.980
Egwene!

14:27.367 --> 14:29.244
Don't smile.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.874
Is the Amyrlin back?

14:34.874 --> 14:35.959
You talk to her?

14:37.294 --> 14:38.378
No.

14:39.754 --> 14:40.964
First time we were here,

14:40.964 --> 14:43.383
she told us we were called
by the Wheel itself.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.302
But all we've done since
we signed their Book of Novices

14:45.302 --> 14:46.636
is clean.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.972
Being a novice
is a rite of passage.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.932
Every single Aes Sedai
has done it,

14:50.932 --> 14:52.601
even the Amyrlin.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.645
It builds... character.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.106
I have enough character.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.983
Clear the table.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.490
Leave the bucket.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.995
What are the five threads
of the One Power?

15:13.288 --> 15:14.497
Air,

15:14.497 --> 15:16.291
earth, fire...

15:16.291 --> 15:18.168
spirit

15:18.168 --> 15:19.794
- and water.
- Good.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.005
When you touch these threads,

15:22.005 --> 15:24.966
you pull at the elements
of the world itself.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.885
By the end of today,
each one of you

15:26.885 --> 15:29.638
will drink the water
in your glass.

15:31.973 --> 15:35.477
Those of you who master
this weave will enjoy far more

15:35.477 --> 15:37.937
than those who do not.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.022
Now watch.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.485
Draw threads of earth
with your right hand,

15:43.485 --> 15:47.030
from the stones
of this tower itself.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.450
With your left hand,
pull threads of water

15:50.450 --> 15:54.037
from the moisture in the air or
even this glass in front of you.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.957
Now weave them together.

16:02.921 --> 16:06.383
Now pick up your glass.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.468
Pour it through your weave.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.361
Your turn.

16:27.445 --> 16:31.991
It will take you many tries to
get the water perfectly clean.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.413
But you will get better.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.333
You have two capable hands.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.086
It will be easier
if you use them.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.630
I didn't come here for easy.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.969
Why are your eyes open?

16:50.969 --> 16:53.513
You haven't even
embraced the Source.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.558
So I can see
when you're looming over me.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.980
Picture the bud of a flower...

17:01.980 --> 17:03.898
in your mind's eye.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.860
It's pink.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.529
It's supple.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.448
- It's ready to...
- It's not working.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.158
- Try again.
- I did try again.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.125
In Fal Dara, the two of you
saw your true potential.

17:22.125 --> 17:26.337
Lady Amalisa flattened
an entire army of Trollocs.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.547
Using your power,

17:27.547 --> 17:28.715
not hers.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.216
Yours.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.552
It will take you
years of hard work

17:32.552 --> 17:34.179
to learn
how to do that yourself.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.264
But you can.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.975
No one should have
that much power.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.352
You can either embrace
what you are

17:41.352 --> 17:43.104
or fear it.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.481
Egwene is strong,

17:44.481 --> 17:46.316
stronger than most,

17:46.316 --> 17:47.525
but you...

17:47.525 --> 17:50.278
you have ten times that power, Nynaeve,

17:50.278 --> 17:52.280
whether you want it or not.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.576
Five months now in this tower
and you haven't channeled,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.036
not once.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.997
Whatever block
is holding you back,

18:00.997 --> 18:03.166
it's time to break through it.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.213
No one leaves today without
drinking their glass of water.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.216
Now close your eyes.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.014
Close your eyes.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.912
You didn't say
it had to be clean.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.005
<i>Egwene al'Vere--</i>

18:51.005 --> 18:52.215
how is she coming along?

18:52.215 --> 18:54.968
She needs to... loosen up

18:54.968 --> 18:58.221
a bit.
Nynaeve al'Meara, however...

18:58.221 --> 18:59.889
Still blocked?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.224
She hasn't channeled

19:01.224 --> 19:03.393
ever since she arrived
at the Tower.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.854
Perhaps she needs
a more effective teacher.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.983
We've all tried.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.901
Uh, my apologies--

19:11.901 --> 19:15.655
all of us who are not
explicitly forbidden.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.033
Perhaps our beloved
Mistress of Novices

19:19.033 --> 19:20.994
might make an exception
just this once.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.205
A novice died in your care.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.458
The One Power is dangerous.
Using it is dangerous.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.586
Any loss is too many.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.089
This tower used to be full.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.217
But year after year,
fewer girls come to us.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.802
- And with less power.
- Yet the world

19:37.802 --> 19:40.179
around us simmers.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.347
Hmm?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.684
The hunt for the Horn of Valere
called in Illian,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.811
Trolloc raids near Arafel

19:46.811 --> 19:49.397
and another false Dragon
has declared himself in Saldaea.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.442
They say he's even more powerful
than Logain.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.902
You can feel it.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.778
Something is coming.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.572
And we're not ready for it.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.117
Nynaeve is the single
most potent weapon we've found

20:01.117 --> 20:03.661
against the Dark
in a thousand years. Uh...

20:04.871 --> 20:06.831
Let me talk to her, at least.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.587
A talk.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.464
That's it. Now get out of here,

20:14.464 --> 20:16.466
the lot of you.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.885
This is a mistake, sister.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.599
Oh. Now, Alanna,

20:24.599 --> 20:27.644
who's ever been hurt
by a little talk?

20:27.644 --> 20:29.062
Hmm.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.115
They are saddling
the horses.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.785
I'll be right there.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.540
Another letter for
Mistresses al'Meara and al'Vere?

20:53.336 --> 20:55.964
Nynaeve and Egwene
are all I have

20:55.964 --> 20:58.007
now that Rand's...

21:00.843 --> 21:02.220
...gone.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.723
And who knows where Mat is.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.561
I keep asking back home
about him, but...

21:13.940 --> 21:15.358
Come.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.069
The hunt for the Horn of Valere

21:18.069 --> 21:19.654
awaits.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.825
The new tracker Lord Ingtar has
hired has put up a signal fire.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.451
He's found something.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.996
Uno won't be happy.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.699
Some tracker.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.744
A bloody signal fire'll
let Padan Fain

22:07.744 --> 22:11.539
and his Darkfriends
know exactly where we are.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.417
I know very little
about this new tracker,

22:14.417 --> 22:17.670
this "sniffer"
Lord Ingtar's hired.

22:17.670 --> 22:22.091
But I'm sure he's no match
for you, Master Nomesta.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.343
Though it's been weeks
since we've seen trace of Fain,

22:24.343 --> 22:27.930
it always seems you're on
the verge of a fresh discovery.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.557
Are you taking the piss?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.184
No.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.560
Mate, he'd never.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.523
Tell us again of the near miss
at Watch Hill.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.151
So close to Padan Fain

22:40.151 --> 22:43.654
I could smell
his Light-forsaken arse.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.490
If you lot hadn't splashed

22:45.490 --> 22:47.909
across the stream
like a herd of breastfed cattle,

22:47.909 --> 22:51.120
I'd be roasting his corpse
on a spit

22:51.120 --> 22:53.623
and playing a tune
on the Horn of bloody Valere.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.794
You are taking the piss.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.713
- You disrespectful goat...
- Uno.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.183
Elyas.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.603
Do you want to put out
that signal fire

23:15.603 --> 23:20.108
before you bring Fain and his
Darkfriends crashing in on us?

23:20.108 --> 23:21.692
Fire's not mine.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.576
Down here.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.221
May they shelter
in the palm of the Creator.

24:11.325 --> 24:14.412
There was a child
who made it out.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.978
The dog was trying
to protect her.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.148
One
of Fain's Darkfriends.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.609
A Shienaran, it seems.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.571
He must've been one of the men
who helped Fain into Fal Dara.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.199
Has been traveling
with him ever since.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.160
Bloody traitor.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.453
That's enough.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.123
We will bury the slaughtered

24:59.123 --> 25:00.541
and follow in the morning.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.056
You're sure
it's from before the Breaking?

25:16.807 --> 25:20.394
Spend my fair share of time
haggling Sea Folk.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.397
And they are
the best in the game.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.317
You've got no interest in that.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.861
It's the heartstone you want.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.039
Pieces of cuendillar
are rare, yes,

25:40.039 --> 25:41.958
but what makes you think
I want this one?

25:41.958 --> 25:43.960
It's broken.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.378
And?

25:45.378 --> 25:48.214
Stuff's made
from the One Power itself.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.717
And you and I both know

25:51.717 --> 25:54.637
it has one defining trait.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.266
It's unbreakable.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.822
The bond made things easier.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.574
It was like a friend

26:15.574 --> 26:17.159
walking along with us,

26:17.159 --> 26:18.953
chatting away
so we never had to.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.539
She's tired, she's hungry,

26:21.539 --> 26:24.125
she's angry, she's afraid.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.504
And now silence.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.465
You don't strike me as a man

26:31.465 --> 26:32.800
who's afraid
of a little silence.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.728
She wants me to leave.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.856
You can.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.525
An Aes Sedai needs a Warder.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.278
Adeleas manages fine
without one.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.738
She has you.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.032
So does Moiraine.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.617
Should she need me.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.752
I'm not leaving.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.795
Suit yourself.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.594
You're almost as stubborn
as she is.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.850
Almost.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.355
When did this come
into your possession?

27:27.355 --> 27:29.523
Couple of months back.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.608
Where?

27:30.608 --> 27:32.193
Outside Cairhien.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.862
The old moon dial there
shattered one night this spring.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.912
I know
you have men following me.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.956
I want them gone, too.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.833
I don't take kindly
to unwanted company.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.710
Your enemies are your own.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.671
It seems there's something
written on this.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.090
Aye.

27:55.091 --> 27:58.302
The whole dial was covered
in a poem when they found it.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.887
Written in blood.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.264
Old Tongue.

28:03.265 --> 28:05.810
I have a copy, actually.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.561
If you're interested.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.274
Always loved me a good poem.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.904
No, no, no, no, no.
I think that's enough questions.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.490
You can have the heartstone...

28:19.490 --> 28:21.742
for 50 marks.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.828
The poem...

28:23.828 --> 28:25.538
that'll cost you five more.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.498
- Five?
- Mm.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.667
For a poem?

28:29.667 --> 28:31.752
That could buy me
the finest Domani racehorse.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.629
Aye. True enough.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.800
One mark for the poem then.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.927
But I'm not budging
on the heartstone.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.679
50 marks

28:41.679 --> 28:44.265
or I walk out of here with it.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.040
This is all I need.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.715
Thank you for your time
and travel.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.383
- But the heartstone...
- Sea Folk might be

29:19.383 --> 29:22.887
good at the game, Master Domon,
but the Aes Sedai invented it.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.640
Be careful when you insult one.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.857
Ah...

29:37.485 --> 29:40.321
Ah, serves me right, I suppose.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.036
These men you say
are following you,

29:47.036 --> 29:48.454
what do they look like?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.581
Only caught a glimpse
from a distance,

29:50.581 --> 29:54.084
once, when we, uh, left the dock
at Whitebridge.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.836
Two men in black cloaks
on horseback.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.087
Did you see their faces?

29:59.215 --> 30:00.382
No.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.675
Their hoods covered them.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.262
Go back to your boat. Now.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.723
Take it to Illian, don't stop,

30:07.723 --> 30:09.308
and then on to the sea.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.061
Sail east or west
as far and fast as you can.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.354
<i>Spray's</i> a-a riverboat. She...

30:13.354 --> 30:15.940
Then stay to the shadows,
but go, now.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.234
Here are ten marks
for provisions.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.990
What have you got me
wrapped up in, eh?

30:24.990 --> 30:26.408
The Wheel weaves
as the Wheel wills,

30:26.408 --> 30:27.660
Master Domon.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.413
Light be with you.

31:03.821 --> 31:06.115
I knew we should've stuck
to the wooden swords.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.950
Why? She's good.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.119
- I almost had you.
- Careful.

31:10.119 --> 31:12.955
You'll be bonded to an Aes Sedai
before you even become one.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.124
I'm in no danger of
becoming an Aes Sedai.

31:15.124 --> 31:18.919
I take it class today
did not go as planned?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.590
I know you love her,
but Alanna's a real piece of...

31:22.590 --> 31:24.675
Alanna Sedai to you.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.348
It's not her, it's this...

31:31.348 --> 31:33.892
It's this whole place.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.102
I don't know.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.316
The first month
of Warder training,

31:40.316 --> 31:41.984
they force you to fight
ten other men alone.

31:41.984 --> 31:45.195
Usually only get in one hit,

31:45.195 --> 31:47.239
maybe two,

31:47.239 --> 31:48.657
while you're being beaten
within an inch of your life.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.744
There's only one thing
that keeps you going.

31:51.744 --> 31:55.331
The reason that brought you here
in the first place.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.749
Which is?

31:56.749 --> 31:58.500
Different for everyone.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.461
What was it for you?

32:00.461 --> 32:02.296
I fell in love with a Warder.

32:02.296 --> 32:04.173
And you?

32:04.173 --> 32:06.675
I fell in love
with an Aes Sedai.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.470
You always make me
feel like the third wheel.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.353
The Aes Sedai will devise
special tortures

32:17.353 --> 32:18.896
to put each of you through
during your training.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.106
But rest assured,

32:21.106 --> 32:23.692
the intention is the same.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.739
So you'll save yourself
a lot of time

32:28.739 --> 32:31.283
and hurt

32:31.283 --> 32:35.454
if you can answer
that one simple question.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.832
Why'd you come here?

32:47.216 --> 32:48.467
Egwene?

32:49.927 --> 32:51.095
Egwene?

32:57.935 --> 32:59.520
Come in.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.564
Do you need a moment
to get dressed?

33:02.564 --> 33:05.192
I said come in.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.300
Hungry?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.511
No, thank you.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.764
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened this morning.

33:35.764 --> 33:39.309
Um, juggling two things at once,

33:39.309 --> 33:42.062
no matter what I do,
it feels very...

33:43.522 --> 33:45.274
...messy.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.777
When I first started experimenting,

33:48.777 --> 33:53.490
I found it very difficult
to split my focus.

33:53.490 --> 33:57.619
You just have to relax

33:57.619 --> 34:01.582
and let go of all expectations.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.125
When we are used to one partner,

34:03.125 --> 34:06.754
it can be very difficult
to open ourselves up to two.

34:08.464 --> 34:11.592
- Partner?
- My advice...

34:11.592 --> 34:14.928
focus on your own pleasure.

34:14.928 --> 34:19.266
When it starts to feel good,
you follow that sensation.

34:21.226 --> 34:25.063
- Let it bloom
deep inside of you.
- Um, I'm sorry.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.900
I-I think
you may have misunderstood me.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.694
I was talking about, um...

34:30.694 --> 34:32.237
the weave from class.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.115
It's-it's hard for me
to focus on the earth threads

34:35.115 --> 34:40.120
- and the water threads
at the same time.
- Oh.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.040
In that case,
you're probably focusing

34:43.040 --> 34:46.293
on the individual grains of dirt
instead of the collective mass.

34:46.293 --> 34:49.171
You're trying to use hundreds
of weaves instead of just two.

34:49.171 --> 34:51.215
That makes sense.

34:51.215 --> 34:55.636
Thank you, uh, so much for...

34:55.636 --> 34:57.805
- all your help.
- Egwene?

35:01.350 --> 35:05.229
Remember, things are messy
before they are perfect.

35:06.230 --> 35:10.192
Nothing worthwhile is
neat and tidy.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.089
What are you doing here?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.968
I've been keeping tabs on you,
you know.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.929
And to be perfectly blunt,

35:38.929 --> 35:40.639
you've proven to be
quite the disappointment.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.643
You're wasting your time
with swords.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.812
It's beneath you.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.730
The Warders have taught me more
in the last five months

35:48.730 --> 35:50.691
than all of your sisters combined.

35:50.691 --> 35:52.818
Yeah, swords are for the weak,
for men.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.779
If a man came at me
with a sword,

35:55.779 --> 35:57.573
I could meet him
with another blade.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.286
Made from the air,

36:02.286 --> 36:04.913
better than most steel blades,
but still...

36:04.913 --> 36:06.582
not much use,

36:06.582 --> 36:10.127
because now I have to fight
hand-to-hand,

36:10.127 --> 36:12.629
draining my strength.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.256
Putting me in
a vulnerable position.

36:17.551 --> 36:20.554
I don't want it to be
a fair fight.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.224
I want to win.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.359
Let me go!

36:34.359 --> 36:37.029
You asked me once
why Reds don't have Warders.

36:38.614 --> 36:42.367
Because they are a distraction,
a weakness.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.913
We can protect ourselves.

36:45.913 --> 36:49.166
Warders are nothing more
than glorified dogs.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.960
Following at
their sisters' heels.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.922
Showering them with praise,
stroking their egos.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.716
And the most loyal of Warders,

36:57.716 --> 36:59.426
like your precious Lan,

36:59.426 --> 37:03.430
usually end up a footnote
casualty in some fight

37:03.430 --> 37:05.724
their Aes Sedai forgets
before they...

37:05.724 --> 37:07.851
Enough!

37:09.603 --> 37:11.021
There she is.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.944
You saw that weave only once,
and you were able to copy it.

37:16.944 --> 37:20.197
If you don't let me go
right now...

37:24.159 --> 37:26.119
What did you do to me?

37:26.119 --> 37:27.704
I shielded you from the Source.

37:29.456 --> 37:33.126
You can still feel it,
but you can't touch it, can you?

37:33.126 --> 37:36.880
It's making you angry.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.676
Use that anger.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.804
My sisters would have you believe

37:43.804 --> 37:45.806
there's only one way
to channel,

37:45.806 --> 37:48.392
one way to become an Aes Sedai.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.353
But they're wrong.

37:51.353 --> 37:54.106
You're here to learn.

37:54.106 --> 37:57.150
Not about silt or swords

37:57.150 --> 37:59.111
but about power.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.490
I want to see you become
so powerful

38:03.490 --> 38:07.119
that no man, no woman,

38:07.119 --> 38:10.038
will ever be able
to take that away from you.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.377
Not even me.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.560
Why are you doing this for him?

39:13.560 --> 39:14.978
He betrayed you all.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.897
He was a Dark friend.

39:16.897 --> 39:19.316
All men deserve a proper burial.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.360
If it was up to Uno, he would've
left his corpse to the vultures.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.113
Which is why I'm in charge
and Uno is not.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.493
Does it bother you?

39:29.493 --> 39:31.870
That I've bestowed
this small mercy on him?

39:31.870 --> 39:35.040
Hundreds of your people died
in Fal Dara

39:35.040 --> 39:37.501
because that man
opened the gates.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.170
And that doesn't make you angry?

39:40.170 --> 39:42.672
You don't want revenge?

39:42.672 --> 39:45.759
If Shienarans sought revenge
for all the wrongs done to us,

39:45.759 --> 39:48.428
there'd be no Shienarans left
in the Borderlands.

39:49.638 --> 39:53.183
As for anger...

39:55.018 --> 39:57.687
That won't bring my men back.

39:59.606 --> 40:04.861
Folk in Two Rivers were
so kind to Padan Fain.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.030
We'd always stop to chat.

40:08.323 --> 40:12.869
We'd offer him a pint
and a warm meal.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.704
A place to sleep.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.832
Myself included.

40:19.543 --> 40:23.213
I keep seeing this image
of him waving to my wife.

40:27.175 --> 40:32.264
And Laila,
big smile on her face,

40:32.264 --> 40:34.057
waving right back.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.062
And in return
for all of that kindness,

40:39.062 --> 40:41.523
he brought the Trollocs
to our door.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.331
There's a rage inside of me.

41:00.125 --> 41:04.337
And the closer we get to
finding him, the more it grows.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.218
I'm scared that when
we finally come face-to-face,

41:10.218 --> 41:12.929
I won't be able to stop myself.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.389
From what?

41:14.389 --> 41:16.183
Killing him.

41:16.183 --> 41:20.687
Watching him bleed out
in front of me like Laila did.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.616
Perhaps Fain had a reason.

41:35.452 --> 41:36.995
For doing what he did.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.877
Now, you may not like
the answer,

41:43.877 --> 41:47.589
but you may find it worth
asking the question.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.072
How did it go?

42:22.249 --> 42:23.917
Who was he, Moiraine?

42:23.917 --> 42:25.335
Bayle Domon.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.338
A sailor from Illian.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.257
Why was he here?

42:30.257 --> 42:31.675
What did you want from him?

42:31.675 --> 42:34.344
Is an Aes Sedai not allowed
her secrets?

42:37.514 --> 42:39.182
Don't smile at me.

42:39.182 --> 42:42.060
Shut me out
and try to drive me away,

42:42.060 --> 42:45.772
don't you dare smile at me
as if everything is fine,

42:45.772 --> 42:48.608
as if you don't know
exactly what you're doing.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.302
I'll have my dinner up here tonight.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.725
Make it yourself.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.814
And have it wherever you want.

44:05.477 --> 44:07.395
Look what came, from Perrin.

44:10.440 --> 44:11.816
What're you doing?

44:13.193 --> 44:14.778
It's Bel Tine.

44:15.945 --> 44:17.322
Today?

44:20.575 --> 44:22.535
Can't believe I forgot.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.164
What does the letter say?

44:33.254 --> 44:34.923
He says they're still
searching for Padan Fain

44:34.923 --> 44:38.218
and the Horn of Valere,
but they've lost the trail.

44:41.888 --> 44:43.264
What is it?

44:46.810 --> 44:50.897
"There's something about being
with these soldiers.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.649
They have this saying
about swords

44:52.649 --> 44:55.026
and shields and enemy fire.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.946
It's very complicated
and involves a lot of birds...

44:57.946 --> 45:01.157
...but the basic idea

45:01.157 --> 45:03.076
is that if you stand alone
with a shield,

45:03.076 --> 45:04.869
much of your body's
still exposed.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.496
But if you stand in a group

45:06.496 --> 45:08.748
covering each other
with your shields,

45:08.748 --> 45:10.792
nothing can touch any of you.

45:13.628 --> 45:16.798
It made me think of us,

45:16.798 --> 45:18.091
all of us,

45:18.091 --> 45:20.468
and how together
we face the impossible.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.680
But now, in our separate corners
of the world,

45:23.680 --> 45:26.307
every day feels exposed.

45:33.440 --> 45:38.194
Which is a long-winded way
to say I miss you both.

45:39.863 --> 45:43.283
And Rand, Laila.

45:43.283 --> 45:45.994
Especially now,
this close to Bel Tine.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.164
Let's promise that
come next year,

45:49.164 --> 45:51.374
the four of us will celebrate together.

45:53.209 --> 45:55.545
Loial and I could meet you two
in Tar Valon.

45:57.088 --> 46:00.800
And if we're lucky,
wherever he is,

46:00.800 --> 46:04.345
Mat will manage to stay out of
trouble and join us, too."

46:07.390 --> 46:09.517
<i>"I miss you both,
and Rand,</i>

46:09.517 --> 46:11.561
Laila.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.856
Especially now,
this close to Bel Tine.

46:14.856 --> 46:17.150
Let's promise that next year,

46:17.150 --> 46:20.653
the four of us will celebrate together.

46:20.653 --> 46:24.949
Loial and I could meet you two
in Tar Valon."

46:26.117 --> 46:28.036
Hmm.

46:28.036 --> 46:29.913
Now, that must be painful.

46:29.913 --> 46:33.291
A dozen letters now, and not
a single mention of Mat Cauthon.

46:34.918 --> 46:39.088
I suppose it would be difficult

46:39.088 --> 46:44.469
to forgive you...
for abandoning them.

46:48.056 --> 46:50.016
What do you want from me?

46:50.016 --> 46:52.769
Naivety doesn't suit you.

46:52.769 --> 46:55.605
I haven't touched that dagger
in six months.

46:58.191 --> 47:02.487
I am not a threat to you
or your Red sisters,

47:02.487 --> 47:06.282
or Moiraine,
or the entire bloody world.

47:13.373 --> 47:15.792
Merry Bel Tine, Mat.

48:26.696 --> 48:30.533
I just miss Rand so much.

48:34.746 --> 48:37.165
No matter how much I complain
about this place,

48:37.165 --> 48:39.000
I'm not going anywhere.

48:43.546 --> 48:46.466
<i>I'm here.
I'm here with you always.</i>

49:09.989 --> 49:11.699
<i>For Rand.</i>

49:11.699 --> 49:14.827
<i>May his spirit find his way
back to us,</i>

49:14.827 --> 49:17.080
<i>in this life or the next.</i>

49:19.332 --> 49:22.460
<i>He gave his life to save us all
from the Dark One.</i>

49:24.170 --> 49:26.255
<i>I'm proud to have called him
"friend."</i>

49:49.237 --> 49:50.655
Thanks.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.388
- Want us to wait?
- Yes.

50:16.931 --> 50:19.475
- Tonight, she'll come.
- Yes, of course.

50:19.475 --> 50:21.227
Soon, I'm sure.

50:21.227 --> 50:26.315
Perhaps she just ate an
uncharacteristically late lunch.

50:31.904 --> 50:36.743
Lan, I think you're taking this
all too personally.

50:39.746 --> 50:42.790
It has absolutely nothing to do
with you.

50:42.790 --> 50:45.334
It only affects you
if you let it,

50:45.334 --> 50:50.256
and I am unequivocally
unaffected by it.

50:50.256 --> 50:52.425
- You are not her Warder.
- No.

50:52.425 --> 50:55.303
- But she's living in my house.
- Our house.

50:55.303 --> 50:58.806
Technically my house,
that I allow you to live in.

51:08.566 --> 51:12.528
When a woman who can channel is
cut off from the One Power,

51:12.528 --> 51:16.407
it feels like
the most brutal form of assault.

51:16.407 --> 51:20.244
Your body no longer feels
like your own.

51:20.244 --> 51:24.332
Your mind reliving the trauma
again and again,

51:24.332 --> 51:28.795
remembering what you once were
and what you'll never be again.

51:28.795 --> 51:30.797
Yes.

51:30.797 --> 51:33.007
Most women never recover.

51:35.051 --> 51:37.178
Most women die.

51:37.178 --> 51:40.014
But not Moiraine Sedai.

51:40.014 --> 51:42.975
Every single day, she fights.

51:42.975 --> 51:46.771
She wakes up, and she puts
one foot in front of the other.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.523
She fills up those buckets,

51:48.523 --> 51:51.359
no matter how many trips
to the well she has to make.

51:51.359 --> 51:54.737
No matter how much water
she spills along the way.

51:55.738 --> 51:59.909
I don't look at Moiraine Sedai
and see a selfish woman.

51:59.909 --> 52:02.829
I look at her
and I see strength.

52:02.829 --> 52:06.165
More strength than any of us
could possibly muster.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.212
The bond between
an Aes Sedai and her Warder

52:11.212 --> 52:14.173
is one way we communicate,

52:14.173 --> 52:16.759
but not the only one.

52:18.761 --> 52:21.389
The 20 years
you've spent together

52:21.389 --> 52:23.808
are the common language
you share.

52:24.809 --> 52:29.522
Perhaps, instead of trying
to force her to speak,

52:29.522 --> 52:34.277
it's time for you to be quiet
and really listen.

52:40.825 --> 52:43.953
I think that's the first time
in my life

52:43.953 --> 52:46.622
someone's told me
I need to be quiet.

54:02.114 --> 54:05.326
Uhp.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.455
Lan...

56:40.481 --> 56:41.982
Lan.

58:08.569 --> 58:10.487
Cover your ears!

58:36.472 --> 58:39.683
What aren't you telling me?

59:03.374 --> 59:07.169
<i>Together we faced
the impossible. All of us.</i>

59:08.337 --> 59:10.506
<i>But now, in our separate
corners of the world,</i>

59:10.506 --> 59:12.549
<i>every day feels exposed.</i>

59:17.972 --> 59:20.975
<i>At the
Eye of the World,</i>

59:20.975 --> 59:22.142
<i>we didn't defeat the Dark One.</i>

59:22.142 --> 59:23.894
We set his strongest
lieutenant free.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.146
<i>The Last Battle's coming.</i>

59:28.524 --> 59:31.026
<i>And we're already losing it.</i>

59:32.278 --> 59:34.196
The Wheel never
gives anyone what they want.

59:34.196 --> 59:37.533
<i>If you want something,
you have to take it.</i>

59:42.079 --> 59:43.539
- I'm ready.
- Let her face what she fears.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.332
No!

59:46.875 --> 59:49.378
<i>The hunt for
the Horn of Valere awaits.</i>

59:49.378 --> 59:52.214
With this, the whole world
will be ours.

59:52.756 --> 59:55.718
His friends will turn them all
to the Dark.

59:55.718 --> 59:58.178
There's a rage inside of me.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.852
I'm leaving.
You don't have to come.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:06.729
If our friends are in trouble,
why would you think

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:08.731
<i>I'd ever stay here?</i>

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.941
<i>It's not always
the most powerful</i>

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.235
who write history.
It's the ones who survive.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.242
<i>There are many paths
to walk through the night.</i>

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.538
<i>I am not looking
to repeat my failures.</i>

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:26.081
I believe in what you do.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:29.001
<i>I'm tired of being
a spoke in the Wheel.</i>

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:31.879
<i>You're not
a spoke, boy.</i>

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:34.715
<i>You are the water</i>

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.759
that turns the Wheel itself.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.678
<i>Or dashes it to pieces.</i>

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:46.310
You were born to
protect this world.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.604
<i>Not just the ones you love.</i>

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.317
<i>The heroes of today,
that is what we are now.</i>

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.737
It's time we start acting
like it.
