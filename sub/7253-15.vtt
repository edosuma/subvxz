00:00.876 --> 00:01.627
<i>Previously on "Gilmore Girls.."</i>

00:01.669 --> 00:02.628
- Logan.

00:01.669 --> 00:02.628
- Yeah?

00:02.670 --> 00:04.212
- I love you.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.212
- Wow!

00:04.254 --> 00:05.589
You're damn straight.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.589
I'm gonna party.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.007
I'm gonna do it while

00:05.631 --> 00:07.007
I have the chance

00:07.048 --> 00:08.550
because, come June,

00:07.048 --> 00:08.550
my life is over!

00:08.592 --> 00:10.135
You have every door

00:08.592 --> 00:10.135
open to you.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.762
You talk about all

00:10.177 --> 00:11.762
these doors being open?

00:11.804 --> 00:14.055
All I see is<i> one</i> door

00:11.804 --> 00:14.055
and I'm being pushed through it!

00:14.097 --> 00:16.475
I just don't want your father

00:14.097 --> 00:16.475
to be disappointed in me.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.978
In order for my dad to be

00:16.517 --> 00:18.978
truly disappointed in you

00:19.019 --> 00:20.395
your name would

00:19.019 --> 00:20.395
have to be Logan.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.272
Had a long day, Logan.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.272
Don't wanna play games.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.274
- Is dinner over?

00:22.314 --> 00:24.274
- No.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.609
The Huntzberger family

00:24.316 --> 00:25.609
shanghai is over.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.652
Dinner, however,

00:25.651 --> 00:26.652
is still going on.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.695
You don't got it.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.279
I thought I was doing okay.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.072
- You<i> crushed</i> that girl!

00:29.321 --> 00:31.072
- I was honest with her.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
I don't pussyfoot.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
You know that.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.994
You've got moxie, my friend.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.994
I'll give you that.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.286
I think I get it from my dad.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.079
- I hate your dad.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.079
- Me too.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.207
Paris was ousted

00:38.121 --> 00:40.207
and when she found out

00:40.248 --> 00:42.125
that I had taken her place

00:42.167 --> 00:43.752
she kind of kicked me

00:42.167 --> 00:43.752
out of the apartment.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.295
Well..

00:45.337 --> 00:46.547
...you can move in with me.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.674
- Luke, will you marry me?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.674
- Yes.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.217
How are the wedding plans going?

00:50.258 --> 00:52.093
Done. The dress, the cake,

00:50.258 --> 00:52.093
the place, the invitations.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.178
June 3rd, by the way.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.263
- I'm your father.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.263
- Yes.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.724
I didn't know about you.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.141
I want a relationship,

00:56.765 --> 00:58.141
I wanna talk to her

00:58.183 --> 00:59.894
and see her on a regular basis.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.353
Okay.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.104
How about I just come

01:01.395 --> 01:03.104
and hang out at the diner?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.439
What diner? My diner?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.316
So, uh, who do you

01:04.481 --> 01:06.316
belong to? Ceaser?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.651
My father owns the place.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.069
The diner, at least.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.069
Not sure about the land.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.988
- Your father?

01:09.110 --> 01:10.988
- My biological father.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.907
- When did you find out?

01:11.030 --> 01:12.907
- Two months ago.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.115
Two months?

01:14.157 --> 01:15.158
That's a hell of a long time

01:15.200 --> 01:16.535
to go without telling me.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.495
It's everything, you know?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.495
It's all piling up.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.955
It's all happening so fast.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.540
If it's all happening

01:19.997 --> 01:21.540
too fast, you know

01:21.582 --> 01:22.791
we could just postpone..

01:22.833 --> 01:24.626
- Postpone the wedding?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.626
- Yeah..

01:24.668 --> 01:26.378
I mean, it's not set in stone..

01:26.420 --> 01:28.547
And...that would be okay

01:26.420 --> 01:28.547
with you?

01:28.589 --> 01:29.924
Sure.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.052
Morning, everyone.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.135
[all mumbling]

01:33.092 --> 01:34.135
Good morning.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.804
What's wrong?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.804
Oh!

01:35.846 --> 01:37.932
- Uh-oh, food funk?

01:35.846 --> 01:37.932
- 'Major.'

01:37.973 --> 01:39.558
Are we talking

01:37.973 --> 01:39.558
the<i> "Swiss chard a la polonaise"</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:41.018
level funk from last May

01:41.060 --> 01:42.937
the<i> panna cotta </i>

01:41.060 --> 01:42.937
experiment of '05?

01:42.978 --> 01:45.898
- 2001<i> pigeons a la nicoise. </i>

01:42.978 --> 01:45.898
-<i> Pigeons a la nicoise?</i>

01:45.940 --> 01:47.232
Oh, boy!

01:47.983 --> 01:50.069
[sighs]

01:50.110 --> 01:52.279
- Sookie?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.279
- You mean, "sucky"?

01:52.320 --> 01:53.906
- What's up?

01:52.320 --> 01:53.906
- I'll tell you what's up.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.323
- You know what this is?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.323
- An oyster?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.743
- An oyster, fresh, huh?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.743
- It looks fresh to me.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.911
I mean, the idea,

01:57.785 --> 01:58.911
nice and fresh.

01:58.953 --> 01:59.954
- Sure.

01:58.953 --> 01:59.954
- It isn't.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.162
- What isn't?

01:59.995 --> 02:01.162
- Fresh.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.330
- The oyster?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.330
- You're not listening.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.624
- I am too.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.624
- Then what am I saying?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.417
- No idea.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.417
- How long have we been married?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.794
Nine years?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.963
I'm experimenting

02:06.835 --> 02:08.963
for the prefix menu

02:09.004 --> 02:10.589
for Valentine's Day next week

02:10.631 --> 02:11.966
'trying to come up

02:10.631 --> 02:11.966
with something new'

02:12.007 --> 02:13.592
but there's nothing new

02:12.007 --> 02:13.592
under the sun!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.302
I mean, who else

02:13.634 --> 02:15.302
would think to serve

02:15.343 --> 02:16.929
oysters on Valentine's Day?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.221
Hm, I don't know.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.890
Maybe 12,000

02:18.263 --> 02:19.890
other establishments

02:19.932 --> 02:21.308
within spitting distance!

02:21.349 --> 02:22.810
Well, lovers love oysters.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.603
I don't.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.603
I love burritos.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
But people don't want

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
<i>burritos</i> on Valentine's Day.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.232
But how do we know unless

02:26.647 --> 02:29.232
we give them the option, huh?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.734
That's it!

02:29.274 --> 02:30.734
I'll serve burritos!

02:30.776 --> 02:31.777
Sookie, no.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.695
No one else will have burritos.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.030
Sookie, you can't serve

02:33.737 --> 02:35.030
Valentine's Day burritos.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.657
That's flirting with disaster.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.326
We could be talking the octopus

02:36.698 --> 02:39.326
ice cream disaster of '98!

02:39.367 --> 02:41.328
Oh, God, you're right.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.328
I'll figure it out.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.538
I'm just hitting

02:41.369 --> 02:43.538
an oyster wall here.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.667
Okay, take a break, guys.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.667
We'll resume in a bit.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.251
So, um, what are you

02:46.708 --> 02:48.251
and Jackson doing

02:48.293 --> 02:50.004
for Valentine's Day,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.004
huh? Any plans?

02:50.045 --> 02:52.131
Well, after I finish up here,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.131
I'll go home

02:52.171 --> 02:54.257
and Jackson,

02:52.171 --> 02:54.257
wonderful man that he is

02:54.299 --> 02:55.926
will have made a lovely<i> meal</i>

02:55.968 --> 02:58.720
and opened up a bottle

02:55.968 --> 02:58.720
of Syrah and lit a candle

02:58.762 --> 03:00.514
and then<i> he</i> and the kids and I

03:00.555 --> 03:02.474
will have a nice,

03:00.555 --> 03:02.474
romantic meal together.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.018
- Very nice.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.018
- What about you?

03:04.059 --> 03:05.519
- Oh, I'll be here.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.519
- What?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.770
No, you'll be with Luke.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.522
Yeah, but we'll

03:06.812 --> 03:08.522
probably just hang out.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.315
We don't have a reservation

03:08.563 --> 03:10.315
anyplace for dinner.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.651
- I'm sure everything's booked.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.651
- Uh, hello. I'm a chef.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.695
I know other chefs.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.695
I can get you into places.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.905
Maybe...although, Luke says

03:14.736 --> 03:16.905
Valentine's Day

03:16.947 --> 03:18.197
is just another one

03:16.947 --> 03:18.197
of those fake things

03:18.239 --> 03:19.533
like Mother's Day

03:19.574 --> 03:21.576
created by greeting card

03:19.574 --> 03:21.576
companies and it is.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.328
- Actually it's not!

03:21.618 --> 03:23.328
- Really?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.288
I'm printing a history

03:23.370 --> 03:25.288
of Valentine's Day

03:25.330 --> 03:26.581
to go on the tables..

03:26.623 --> 03:29.001
It goes back like 2,000 years!

03:29.043 --> 03:30.377
Oh, well, then it must

03:29.043 --> 03:30.377
have been

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
a greeting card company

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
in<i> Roman</i> times.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.255
You know, the one that came up

03:32.337 --> 03:34.255
with Gladiator's Day.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.674
Anyway, no plans yet.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.093
Lorelai, excuse me

03:35.716 --> 03:38.093
there's a Zydeco band

03:38.135 --> 03:39.136
here to see you.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.138
- A what?

03:39.178 --> 03:41.138
- A Zydeco band?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.598
- Did I mishear him twice?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.598
- Then I did, too.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.726
- Come on.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.726
- Woo-hoo!

03:48.020 --> 03:49.396
[Lorelai chuckles]

03:49.437 --> 03:52.191
Hi, I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.191
How can I help you guys?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.984
- I'm Buzu.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.984
- Buzu? That's your name?

03:54.026 --> 03:55.694
- Buzu?

03:54.026 --> 03:55.694
- Buzu Barnes.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.821
- Buzu Barnes.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.821
- And the Cajun Stompers!

03:57.863 --> 03:59.865
Sorry, I'm like

03:57.863 --> 03:59.865
a thousand miles behind here.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.743
We set this up a while ago,

03:59.907 --> 04:02.743
the audition. Buzu.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.369
Buzu! You're that Buzu.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.746
You know more than one Buzu?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.831
I set this up myself.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.831
It was for the wedding.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.166
- The audition!

04:09.208 --> 04:10.625
- Oh, the wedding.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.625
- What you want to hear?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.252
Well, it's like this, Buzu

04:12.293 --> 04:13.879
um, I don't need to hear

04:12.293 --> 04:13.879
you play because--

04:13.921 --> 04:15.672
No, Ms. Gilmore,

04:13.921 --> 04:15.672
no, it's like this.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.299
When a Zydeco band is at

04:15.714 --> 04:18.299
the instrument, they<i> must</i> play.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.927
- But--

04:18.341 --> 04:19.927
- '"Zydeco Boogaloo," boys.'

04:19.968 --> 04:21.970
One, two, three, four.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.556
<i>[instrumental version</i>

04:22.012 --> 04:24.556
<i>of "Zydeco Boogaloo"]</i>

04:24.598 --> 04:25.891
And they're off.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.517
Since when are you into Zydeco?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.352
I just thought it might be

04:27.559 --> 04:29.352
festive and-and funny.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.896
I-I was gonna audition them

04:30.938 --> 04:33.815
and a-a Dixieland combo

04:30.938 --> 04:33.815
and Led Zepagain.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.817
- Who?

04:33.857 --> 04:35.817
- A Led Zepagain cover band.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.402
Oh! That's clever.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.987
It just slipped my mind.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.739
June 3rd's coming up

04:39.029 --> 04:40.739

09:59.057 --> 10:00.725
Martha's Vineyard?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.725
Really?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.977
'You know, Logan's family has

10:00.767 --> 10:02.977
a place up there. It's awesome!'

10:03.019 --> 10:04.938
And I just cleared

10:03.019 --> 10:04.938
my schedule here at the paper.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.481
Told them,

10:04.979 --> 10:06.481
"Mama needs some time off."

10:06.523 --> 10:08.775
- Good for mama.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.775
- 'So go with us, you and Luke.'

10:08.816 --> 10:09.859
Really? You've run

10:08.816 --> 10:09.859
this past Logan?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.278
- It was his idea.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.278
- No.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.113
I don't know

10:11.319 --> 10:13.113
if Luke would be up for it.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.489
Well, we'll make him

10:13.154 --> 10:14.489
be up for it.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.699
I think he'd like it.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.699
It's beach, it's nature.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.452
I mean, it'll be cold,

10:16.741 --> 10:18.452
but we can still walk outside.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.827
It's beautiful.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.371
Well, I've always wanted

10:19.869 --> 10:21.371
to see the vineyard.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.789
Then force him to come

10:22.830 --> 10:24.082
and if he's

10:22.830 --> 10:24.082
a sourpuss while he's there

10:24.124 --> 10:25.125
you'll still have me.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.251
Okay, I'll talk to him.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.294
I'll e-mail you directions.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.336
Come anytime Friday.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.712
And you've got room and all?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.548
- Me and Luke, plus five?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.548
- Plus five?

10:31.590 --> 10:34.050
Well, I'm not coming

10:31.590 --> 10:34.050
without Buzu and the boys.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.136
- The more the merrier.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.136
- Cool! Bye, hon.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.387
'Bye.'

10:37.429 --> 10:39.013
[Buzu singing]

10:39.055 --> 10:41.558
Buzu, I'm gonna need

10:39.055 --> 10:41.558
my dining room back.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.892
Buzu!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.062
Well, there is all manner

10:44.811 --> 10:46.062
of outdoor activities

10:46.104 --> 10:47.397
to do in Martha's Vineyard.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.190
Canoeing, snorkeling, sailing--

10:49.232 --> 10:51.610
That's mostly summer stuff.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.610
It's the dead of winter.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.194
Hiking and walking,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.194
that's doable.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.447
Yeah, I guess. Is this all

10:53.236 --> 10:55.447
just for this weekend?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.365
- Plus these.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.365
- Isn't that way too much stuff?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.658
It is the dead of winter.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.285
The question is,

10:58.699 --> 11:00.285
do<i> you</i> have enough?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.870
Yeah, I brought enough.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.870
Burglar lamp.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.498
Ooh, and here of course

11:04.539 --> 11:06.291
is the big-time

11:04.539 --> 11:06.291
Martha's Vineyard thing.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.875
- Whaling.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.875
- They have whaling?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.752
Not anymore.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.752
It's just a fun fact.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.962
"Martha's Vineyard was one

11:11.004 --> 11:12.547
of the world's

11:11.004 --> 11:12.547
largest whaling ports."

11:12.589 --> 11:14.757
Says here, "people used

11:12.589 --> 11:14.757
<i>every</i> part of the whale

11:14.799 --> 11:17.594
"back then, the most

11:14.799 --> 11:17.594
important being spermaceti

11:17.636 --> 11:19.720
used in candle production."

11:17.636 --> 11:19.720
Yuck.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.931
Couldn't think up a less gross

11:19.762 --> 11:21.931
substance to use for candles?

11:21.973 --> 11:24.518
You know, it's a good thing

11:21.973 --> 11:24.518
I don't drive a compact.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.353
"Herman Melville once shipped

11:24.559 --> 11:26.353
out of Martha's Vineyard."

11:26.394 --> 11:27.895
Here's a quote from Moby-Dick.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.898
"Oars, oars, grip your oars

11:27.937 --> 11:30.898
and clutch your souls now.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.900
My God, pull, men!"

11:32.942 --> 11:34.235
Wait a second,

11:32.942 --> 11:34.235
that isn't the pulling

11:34.277 --> 11:35.736
they had to do to get

11:34.277 --> 11:35.736
the spermaceti, is it?

11:35.778 --> 11:36.988
I don't think so.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.988
Let's go.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.698
- We're already late.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.698
- Coming.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.951
Now, what else,

11:39.740 --> 11:41.951
what else, what else?

11:41.993 --> 11:44.454
"The first people on the island

11:41.993 --> 11:44.454
of Martha's Vineyard

11:44.496 --> 11:47.999
"were Indians

11:44.496 --> 11:47.999
of the Wampanoag tribe.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.544
"This tribe still makes up

11:48.041 --> 11:50.544
a large part of the town

11:50.585 --> 11:51.919
originally called the Gay Head."

11:51.961 --> 11:53.296
Hm, figures.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.922
"The Indians survived

11:53.338 --> 11:54.922
poverty, disease

11:54.964 --> 11:56.591
then get stuck living in

11:54.964 --> 11:56.591
a place called Gay Head."

11:56.633 --> 11:57.716
I guess.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.801
Do you think there's

11:57.758 --> 11:58.801
any connection

11:58.843 --> 12:00.261
between Gay Head

11:58.843 --> 12:00.261
and spermaceti?

12:00.303 --> 12:02.805
I have no idea.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.805
Wait, it's an island?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.765
- Yeah, apparently.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.765
- Means there's a ferry.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Oh, there is a ferry

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
to Gay Head?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.436
That is just too easy.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.647
Let's see what else

12:08.478 --> 12:10.647
is interesting about the island

12:10.689 --> 12:12.065
we now know

12:10.689 --> 12:12.065
as Martha's Vineyard.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.858
Y-you don't have to do this.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.569
- Do what?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.569
- I'm fine with the weekend.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.362
You don't have to keep

12:15.610 --> 12:17.362
talking the place up.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.656
I just want you to have fun.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.656
You know, I want you to relax.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.242
I'll try, okay?

12:19.698 --> 12:22.242
I just have my concerns.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.160
- What concerns?

12:24.202 --> 12:26.538
Lorelai, where do we

12:24.202 --> 12:26.538
even stand with this guy?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.872
- What guy?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.872
- 'Logan.'

12:27.914 --> 12:29.374
Their relationship

12:27.914 --> 12:29.374
changes daily.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.875
I mean, one day we like him

12:30.917 --> 12:32.751
next day we hate him,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.751
next day we like him.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.588
- Well, we have a sort of truce.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.588
- 'A truce?'

12:34.629 --> 12:35.963
What does that mean, "a truce?"

12:36.005 --> 12:37.632
It's a truce.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.632
Everything's okay.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.718
None of us should invade

12:37.674 --> 12:39.718
each other or fire guns

12:39.758 --> 12:42.470
across our borders or anything.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.470
We're in a truce.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.971
Well, what if they break up

12:42.512 --> 12:43.971
while we're there?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.014
They're not gonna break up.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.224
Our bedroom isn't sharing

12:46.266 --> 12:47.267
a wall with theirs, is it?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.685
I have no idea.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.810
You don't know the layout

12:48.727 --> 12:49.810
of the house?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.104
I thought spermaceti was a pasta

12:51.145 --> 12:52.439
until three minutes ago!

12:52.480 --> 12:54.315
It's weird staying

12:52.480 --> 12:54.315
at people's houses

12:54.357 --> 12:56.109
tiptoeing around,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.109
using their sheets

12:56.150 --> 12:57.402
drinking their

12:56.150 --> 12:57.402
weird tap water.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.903
We'll stick to small beer.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.447
That's what they drank

12:58.945 --> 13:00.447
on the whaling boats.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.074
If it's good enough

13:00.488 --> 13:03.074
for the spermaceti boys..

13:03.116 --> 13:05.201
Come on, I don't want

13:03.116 --> 13:05.201
this to be work for you.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.662
It's not work.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.662
Flipping burgers is work.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.955
This weekend's gonna be fine.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.957
- Maybe even fun?

13:08.996 --> 13:10.957
- Yes, fun.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.710
Oh, hey, uh, I left

13:10.998 --> 13:13.710
April's bike

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
'in the garage.'

13:14.793 --> 13:16.003
Oh, why?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.088
Well, I was gonna fix

13:16.045 --> 13:17.088
the wheel

13:17.130 --> 13:18.506
and I forgot it was in the back.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.091
Is it okay

13:18.548 --> 13:20.091
I parked it there?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.427
Oh, yeah.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.427
It should be safe.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.803
Alright, good.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.803
Let's go!

13:24.845 --> 13:26.097
We have a ferry to catch.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
Please, don't add

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
anything to that.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.268
Party pooper.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.186
Ooh, there are a bunch

13:30.310 --> 13:32.186
of historical lighthouses.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.272
We should definitely see them.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.565
Huh.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.857
I wonder if there's a connection

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
between the shape

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
of lighthouses, ferries

13:39.402 --> 13:41.446
spermaceti and Gay Head.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.281
[laughing]

13:43.323 --> 13:46.242
[instrumental music]

14:02.634 --> 14:04.010
- You made it!

14:02.634 --> 14:04.010
- We made it!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.345
- Hi, Luke!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.345
- Hey, sorry.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.805
- We're late.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.805
- You're not late.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.598
It took longer than we thought,

14:06.845 --> 14:08.598
the ferry and all.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.974
Did you know Martha's Vineyard

14:08.640 --> 14:09.974
is an island?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.309
Well, I've been here before.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.602
Hey, there's

14:11.351 --> 14:12.602
our intrepid travelers.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.728
Hi, Logan!

14:13.770 --> 14:15.355
Welcome, and this must be Luke.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.106
Oh, no, I dumped Luke.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.106
This is Clem.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.567
I picked him up

14:17.148 --> 14:19.567
at a truck stop on 95.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.736
We were at the register

14:19.609 --> 14:21.736
paying for our blue plates

14:21.778 --> 14:23.655
and our hands reached for

14:21.778 --> 14:23.655
the same Dixie Chicks cassette.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.448
- Luke Danes.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.448
- Logan Huntzberger.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.116
Good to have you.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.116
Anything else to unload?

14:27.158 --> 14:29.118
Uh, no, there's a few things.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.118
But I've got it.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.120
- Great!

14:29.160 --> 14:31.120
- So this is the place.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.539
This is the den

14:32.580 --> 14:35.458
and the dining room

14:32.580 --> 14:35.458
which seats 20, the wet bar.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.501
It just keeps getting better.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.085
And that's the living room.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.754
The kitchen's up there

14:38.127 --> 14:39.754
and the ocean's out there

14:39.796 --> 14:40.921
but you can't see it.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.340
Ah, rip-off!

14:42.382 --> 14:43.633
- So you guys hungry?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.633
- No, we're fine.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.343
- We ate on the road.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.343
- 'Cool!'

14:45.385 --> 14:47.303
Just a couple of peculiarities

14:45.385 --> 14:47.303
about the house.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.472
It's a grandma,

14:47.345 --> 14:49.472
so it's got its kinks.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.599
Some of the hardwood floors have

14:49.514 --> 14:51.599
buckled, so watch your step.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.226
The French doors are warped

14:51.641 --> 14:53.226
from the winter.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.686
So you have to give them

14:53.267 --> 14:54.686
a yank when you open them.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.020
And that noise you

14:54.728 --> 14:56.020
may hear outside

14:56.062 --> 14:57.188
your window

14:56.062 --> 14:57.188
in the morning..

14:57.230 --> 14:58.231
That would be Stan.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.440
- Gardener?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.440
- Raccoon.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.817
He's been living

14:59.482 --> 15:00.817
on the property longer

15:00.859 --> 15:02.360
than my family has.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.360
So we give him free reign.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.111
And the showers,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.111
there are three of them.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.155
Run any two at the same time

15:04.153 --> 15:06.155
and they turn to ice.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.866
So give everybody heads-up

15:06.197 --> 15:07.866
before you take a dive.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.283
Oh, good to know.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.951
And in the morning,

15:09.325 --> 15:10.951
we'll have stuff here to eat

15:10.993 --> 15:13.204
or you can go up the street

15:10.993 --> 15:13.204
to Joe's cafe for breakfast.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.164
- They open at eight.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.164
- Seven, actually.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.208
Right, at seven.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.208
We never go before eight.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
But that's all.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
Want to see your room?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.295
Here we are.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.089
We call it, "the king

15:21.337 --> 15:23.089
and queen suite."

15:23.130 --> 15:24.424
Neat. Why?

15:24.465 --> 15:25.759
Because you're

15:24.465 --> 15:25.759
our honored guests

15:25.800 --> 15:26.843
and I just named

15:25.800 --> 15:26.843
it that a second ago.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.927
We'll take it.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.220
So the controller for the heater

15:29.262 --> 15:30.680
is by the nightstand.

15:30.722 --> 15:31.890
All of the windows open

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
except for the second one

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
on the left.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.809
So don't try to open it

15:33.516 --> 15:34.809
'cause you'll hurt your back.

15:34.851 --> 15:35.852
And don't forget

15:34.851 --> 15:35.852
about the showers.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.144
- Got it.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.144
- Okay.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.187
I guess we'll see

15:37.186 --> 15:38.187
you guys later.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.397
I'd really like to tip you.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.440
I only got a 20.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.440
You got change?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.524
Just add it to the bill, ma'am.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.276
- Will do.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.276
- Thanks.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.653
Good to have you here.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.743
- So, nice digs, huh?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.743
- Kind of dark to see.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.160
Well, I saw

15:51.785 --> 15:53.160
the weather forecast.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.537
They're predicting

15:53.202 --> 15:54.537
light in the morning.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.790
- So how does this work?

15:54.579 --> 15:56.790
- How does what work?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.792
Are we supposed to stay

15:56.831 --> 15:58.792
in this room tonight?

15:58.833 --> 16:00.000
Um, what's wrong with the room?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.502
Nothing, it's just

16:00.042 --> 16:01.502
that it's only 9:30.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.921
It's that early?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.589
So what do you think

16:02.962 --> 16:04.589
they're gonna do out there?

16:04.631 --> 16:05.799
I don't know. You think

16:04.631 --> 16:05.799
they're gonna do something?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.007
I don't know,

16:05.840 --> 16:07.007
she's your daughter

16:07.049 --> 16:08.509
and your daughter's

16:07.049 --> 16:08.509
snotty boyfriend.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.844
Snotty?

16:08.551 --> 16:09.844
I thought he was very nice.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.012
You call that nice,

16:09.886 --> 16:12.012
how he embarrassed Rory?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.097
How did he embarrass her?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.432
Correcting her like that

16:14.474 --> 16:16.517
with the whole,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.517
"it's open at seven" thing?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.478
- She was humiliated.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.478
- She wasn't humiliated.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.980
Well, we just need them

16:18.519 --> 16:20.980
to hold on for three days.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.149
- Hold on how?

16:21.021 --> 16:23.149
- Hold on and not break up.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.358
They're not gonna break up

16:23.190 --> 16:24.358
in the next three days.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.819
Lot of tension here.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.027
Okay, so are we

16:25.860 --> 16:27.027
in the room for the night.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
Or you want to venture out?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.238
- I don't know.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.238
- Okay, well.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.281
I'll go see what's what.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.365
Get the lay of the land here.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.242
- Okay.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.959
[instrumental music]

16:52.219 --> 16:55.097
- Psst!

16:52.219 --> 16:55.097
- Hey, you.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.057
Are we supposed

16:55.139 --> 16:57.057
to stay in our rooms?

16:57.099 --> 16:58.810
What? No. Why?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.102
Just checking.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.062
You can stay in there

17:00.144 --> 17:02.062
or come out here.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.482
- Okay, cool.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.482
- Then why are you whispering?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.359
I don't know.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.359
We're in somebody else's house.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.402
I know, it's a little weird

17:06.400 --> 17:08.402
being a foursome.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.779
A little.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.779
We'll adjust.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.114
Yeah, we'll adjust.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.116
So...in or out?

17:14.158 --> 17:16.285
- I think we'll stay in.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.285
- Okay.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.704
- Alright.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.704
- Goodnight.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.246
Night.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.167
[instrumental music]

17:25.503 --> 17:27.087
We've got ourselves

17:25.503 --> 17:27.087
a beautiful day.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.883
- 'Mm-hmm.'

17:27.129 --> 17:29.883
- The ocean is so blue.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.258
I love the beach in the winter.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.177
The summer's too hot,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.177
too congested, you know?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.846
Yep, congested.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.639
- What are you doing?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.639
- Nothing.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.599
- Are you eating?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.599
- Just a power bar.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.142
- Power bar?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.142
- You want one?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.853
No! Luke, why are you eating?

17:41.895 --> 17:42.979
Well, I wasn't sure

17:41.895 --> 17:42.979
what the deal was.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.355
The deal was with what?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.148
I didn't know whether

17:44.397 --> 17:46.148
they served food or not.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.901
- What else do you have in here?

17:46.190 --> 17:47.901
- Just stuff.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.986
- First-aid kit?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.986
- In case we got hurt.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.988
Baggie full of batteries for..

17:52.030 --> 17:54.615
The flashlight,

17:52.030 --> 17:54.615
illuminates up to 50 yards.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.077
Bug spray, radio, granola bars.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.077
Freeze-dried spaghetti?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.746
Just add hot water,

17:58.118 --> 17:59.746
eat it out of the bag.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.955
Am I gonna find

17:59.787 --> 18:00.955
hot water in there?

18:00.997 --> 18:03.541
No, you gotta

18:00.997 --> 18:03.541
heat it up on the stove.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.292
Oh...my God!

18:05.334 --> 18:07.962
It's a bowie knife to cut fish,

18:05.334 --> 18:07.962
cut tree limbs..

18:08.004 --> 18:09.505
- Amputate a leg?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.505
- Uh, not a leg.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.840
It could do a foot.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.258
Luke, this is your

18:10.882 --> 18:12.258
backcountry bag.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.593
Why did you bring

18:12.299 --> 18:13.593
your backcountry bag?

18:13.634 --> 18:15.135
I didn't know

18:13.634 --> 18:15.135
what this weekend was.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.178
You didn't know

18:15.177 --> 18:16.178
we wouldn't be performing

18:16.220 --> 18:17.221
surgery on each other?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.598
I wanted to be prepared.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.807
I thought this bag

18:18.639 --> 18:19.807
was full of clothes.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.308
My other bag's full of it.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.936
- You're gonna freeze!

18:21.350 --> 18:22.936
- It's plenty for me.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
- I'm warm-blooded--

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
- I know, I know.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.397
You're warm-blooded.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.397
Check and see.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.523
Alright, let-let's see

18:26.439 --> 18:27.523
what else

18:27.565 --> 18:29.025
they have to eat

18:27.565 --> 18:29.025
out there, okay?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.484
The freeze-dried spaghetti's

18:29.067 --> 18:30.484
not gonna do it for me.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.945
I didn't mean

18:30.526 --> 18:31.945
to bring the spaghetti.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.320
Come on.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.320
Lave the knife.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.031
Okay.

18:38.701 --> 18:39.994
- Morning!

18:38.701 --> 18:39.994
- Good morning.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.996
Hi, we've got coffee

18:40.036 --> 18:41.996
and pastries over there.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.414
The best pastries in the island.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.165
Yeah, you got to get them

18:43.456 --> 18:45.165
early or they run out.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.043
- Even the prune is good.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.043
- She'll not like the prune.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.962
- She'll like this prune!

18:47.085 --> 18:48.962
- They look great.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.338
- 'Where's Luke?'

18:49.003 --> 18:51.338
- He is waiting for my signal.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.632
- Your signal?

18:51.380 --> 18:52.632
- 'To come out.'

18:52.673 --> 18:53.883
He wants a signal it's okay.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.426
I've got a flare gun

18:53.925 --> 18:55.426
in the garage.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.471
Luke, it's okay!

18:55.468 --> 18:58.471
Come out!

18:58.512 --> 18:59.931
- Morning.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.931
- Hey, Luke.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.808
(Rory)

18:59.973 --> 19:01.808
'Luke, you know,

18:59.973 --> 19:01.808
you don't have to hide.'

19:01.849 --> 19:03.434
I wasn't hiding.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.434
Did you say I was hiding?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.269
- I did not say that.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.269
- Help yourself to whatever.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.312
You've got to read faster.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.354
I read at my own pace

19:07.396 --> 19:09.065
regardless of peer pressure.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.067
But my article is continued in

19:09.107 --> 19:11.067
the section you've been reading

19:11.109 --> 19:12.860
'since before John

19:11.109 --> 19:12.860
wrote his Gospel.'

19:12.902 --> 19:14.904
I keep telling her

19:12.902 --> 19:14.904
we need to buy two papers.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.447
That's wasteful.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.447
We don't need two papers.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.407
We need it for the health

19:16.489 --> 19:18.407
of the relationship.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.492
There's your proof.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.035
We got eggs and stuff too, Luke.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.870
- You still hungry?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.870
- Still? Did you guys eat?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.872
No, we just ate

19:22.912 --> 19:24.872
a big dinner last night.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.457
Right.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.126
Hey, why don't we take

19:26.499 --> 19:28.126
a little walk first?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.543
Huh, the beach is deserted.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.837
We'll have the whole thing

19:29.585 --> 19:30.837
to ourselves.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.171
- Okay.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.171
- 'You might want a coat.'

19:32.212 --> 19:33.673
- I'm fine.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.673
- Cool.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.382
We won't be long.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.094
- Drat!

19:35.424 --> 19:38.094
- You snooze, you lose.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.431
Smell that air, sea..

19:42.473 --> 19:45.518
Yeah, there's sewage

19:42.473 --> 19:45.518
somewhere, too.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.103
I'm loving this.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.729
It's been forever

19:47.145 --> 19:48.729
since I've been to the beach.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.272
Can you imagine living here?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.733
Wonder what real-estate prices

19:50.314 --> 19:52.733
are like.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.360
Probably pretty high.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.612
Bet you the average Joe can't

19:54.401 --> 19:56.612
afford it, that's for sure.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.656
I mean, if you work here,

19:56.654 --> 19:58.656
you can't live here.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.159
So you have to commute

19:58.698 --> 20:01.159
hours everyday.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.162
- Pretty place to work, though.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.162
- Waves keep you up last night?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.830
No, I knew

20:04.203 --> 20:05.830
you were awake, though.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.374
Sorry, it's just, it's<i> so</i> loud.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.127
And just when I got back

20:08.415 --> 20:11.127
to sleep, Dan shows up.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.252
- Who?

20:11.169 --> 20:12.252
- The raccoon.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.005
- Oh, Stan.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.005
- Yeah, right.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.383
He decided to play a "Sousa

20:14.047 --> 20:17.383
March" with the trash-can lids.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.301
That's what a bowie knife's for.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.720
(Rory)

20:19.343 --> 20:20.720
'Hey!'

20:27.518 --> 20:29.562
- Nice out here, huh?

20:27.518 --> 20:29.562
- Beautiful!

20:29.603 --> 20:31.397
- You look like you're freezing.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.397
- I'm fine.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.900
I forgot to give you these.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.943
Oh, we finally

20:33.941 --> 20:35.943
earned your trust, huh?

20:35.985 --> 20:38.071
We decided we'd risk it.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.071
We're heading out!

20:38.112 --> 20:39.321
We'll be back

20:38.112 --> 20:39.321
in a couple of hours.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.907
- Where are you going?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.907
- The gym.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.867
I'm sorry. The ocean's

20:40.948 --> 20:42.867
awfully loud down here.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.160
Where did you say

20:42.909 --> 20:44.160
you are going?

20:44.202 --> 20:46.453
- The gym.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.453
- Sorry, the ocean is so loud--

20:46.495 --> 20:48.706
Stop it. We like to hit

20:46.495 --> 20:48.706
the gym when we're here.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.208
I<i> cannot</i> picture this.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.918
Well, stop mocking

20:50.249 --> 20:51.918
'cause it's a good thing.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.627
I wanna go just

20:51.959 --> 20:53.627
to see you at a gym.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.337
- You wanna go?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.337
- Sure, I'll go.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.463
Cool.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.463
Let's go.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.757
Great, let's all go to the gym.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.717
That will never

20:57.798 --> 20:59.717
stop being funny.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.011
Hit me again, there, friend.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.387
Oh, I needed that..

21:03.429 --> 21:04.430
...especially after

21:03.429 --> 21:04.430
that jog we took.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.472
From the dressing room?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.225
Yeah, it was at least 20 yards.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.727
Plus the three steps we walked

21:07.266 --> 21:09.727
up to get in the building.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.020
That was some gnarly cardio.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.396
What is it about

21:11.062 --> 21:12.396
cucumber water

21:12.438 --> 21:13.564
that makes it so much

21:12.438 --> 21:13.564
more refreshing

21:13.606 --> 21:14.857
than non-cucumber water?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.734
I think it's the cucumber.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.028
So...shall we<i> resume</i>

21:16.776 --> 21:19.028
our workout?

21:19.070 --> 21:21.614
Let's do it.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.449
You know,

21:21.655 --> 21:23.449
this is a nice facility.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.243
I know, I like that

21:23.490 --> 21:25.243
you can get day passes.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.326
You don't have

21:25.284 --> 21:26.326
to pay for a whole--

21:26.368 --> 21:27.703
Aa-ah!

21:27.745 --> 21:29.080
That was loud.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.748
I think a little

21:29.122 --> 21:30.748
warning was in order.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.000
No one remembers gym etiquette?

21:33.042 --> 21:36.087
Hey, any idea what part

21:33.042 --> 21:36.087
of the body this exercises?

21:36.129 --> 21:39.298
I don't know.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.298
Do you lift it or pull it?

21:39.339 --> 21:41.550
Or push it or climb it?

21:41.592 --> 21:43.136
So the walk from

21:41.592 --> 21:43.136
the cucumber water to here

21:43.177 --> 21:44.887
that was, what,

21:43.177 --> 21:44.887
another 20 calories?

21:44.929 --> 21:47.765
Let's call it 40.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.765
Hey, is Luke okay?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.349
Because he seems

21:47.807 --> 21:49.349
a little distracted.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.643
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.436
He's just not much of a traveler

21:52.478 --> 21:53.813
'so it's all

21:52.478 --> 21:53.813
kind of foreign to him.'

21:53.854 --> 21:55.273
'Cause I want him

21:53.854 --> 21:55.273
to have a good time.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.858
He will.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.568
- Yeah?

21:57.900 --> 21:59.568
- Okay if I work in?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.487
Work in what?

22:01.528 --> 22:03.739
Oh, you want to work in.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.449
Yeah, I guess I'm done.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.994
Boy, I'm gonna be sore

22:05.491 --> 22:07.994
in the morning.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.746
Yeah, good reps there, mom.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.873
Oh, you push with your arms.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.542
I was gonna say that.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.542
More cucumber water?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.336
I'm always up

22:15.584 --> 22:17.336
for more cucumber water.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.462
[thud]

22:18.504 --> 22:21.299
God, I'll never

22:18.504 --> 22:21.299
get used to that.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.594
- It's probably your shoes.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.594
- Shoes are fine.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.345
Yeah, but they're a size

22:25.636 --> 22:27.345
too small and they're low-tops.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.140
I bought what they had.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.140
The shoes are fine.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.724
It's a drag

22:29.182 --> 22:30.724
you didn't bring your own gear.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.019
Yeah, drag. Now let's

22:30.766 --> 22:33.019
get going here, alright?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.561
I'm playing all out,

22:33.060 --> 22:34.561
so you play all out.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.896
You're overestimating my skills,

22:34.603 --> 22:35.896
if you don't think

22:35.938 --> 22:37.439
I'm playing all out.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.439
So it's what, 5-1?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.233
6, you got 6, 6-1.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.485
Right, 6-1.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.324
- Sorry.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.324
- Don't apologize.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.075
That was a foul too.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.075
I charged.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.702
- You barely touched me.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.702
- I traveled.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.787
No, you didn't foul me

22:49.743 --> 22:51.787
and you didn't travel.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.497
Okay.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.832
Did you try loosening the laces?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.917
Just check the ball.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.252
- 6-1?

22:56.959 --> 22:58.252
- 7, actually.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.921
- Right, right. 7.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.921
- Sorry.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.506
Don't apologize.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.350
- Hey, guys.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.350
- What's going on?

23:12.390 --> 23:15.686
Oh, wow.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.686
I was, like, in a Zen trance.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.646
- I was totally somewhere else.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.646
- Me too.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.232
- I was in Greece.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.232
- Where were you?

23:19.273 --> 23:20.274
Bergdorf Goodman.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.359
When you reach a Zen trance

23:21.399 --> 23:22.693
you go to Bergdorf Goodman?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.486
To each his own.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.486
Thanks, Ron, Jerry.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.654
Yeah, thanks, guys.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.697
I didn't know

23:25.696 --> 23:26.697
the gym had masseurs.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.740
They don't.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.782
No, Ron and Jerry work

23:28.824 --> 23:29.825
for the laundry service

23:29.867 --> 23:31.118
but they missed their calling.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.661
You got laundry guys

23:31.160 --> 23:32.661
to give you a massage?

23:32.703 --> 23:34.247
Never underestimate

23:32.703 --> 23:34.247
the persuasive powers

23:34.288 --> 23:35.455
of Lorelai Gilmore.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.957
So, you guys have fun

23:36.999 --> 23:38.458
throwing the old hoop around?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.586
- Or something to that effect.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.586
- Look at you.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.962
You look

23:40.627 --> 23:41.962
like a walking billboard

23:42.004 --> 23:43.463
for the Martha's Vineyard

23:42.004 --> 23:43.463
chamber of commerce.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.632
- It's all they had.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.632
- So who won the game?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.093
These shoes stink.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.177
So you beat the shoes.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.929
Nobody won.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.929
We just had fun.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.222
So do you girls need

23:49.970 --> 23:51.222
to clean up at all?

23:51.264 --> 23:52.556
From?

23:52.598 --> 23:53.682
Right, well, I guess

23:52.598 --> 23:53.682
we'll see you out here.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.975
We'll just be about ten minutes.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.062
Okay, see you in ten.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.730
So what do we do?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.275
Ron, Jerry,

23:59.772 --> 24:02.275
you got ten minutes?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.526
[giggling]

24:04.568 --> 24:07.363
I love working out.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.118
(Luke)

24:10.283 --> 24:12.118
'So what is this?

24:10.283 --> 24:12.118
Like, a fancy meal?'

24:12.159 --> 24:13.660
I don't think it's fancy.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.660
It's just a meal.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.828
They want to make us a meal.

24:14.870 --> 24:15.955
'But is it lunch or dinner?'

24:15.996 --> 24:17.957
'I mean, it's at a weird time.'

24:17.998 --> 24:19.208
Well, I think

24:17.998 --> 24:19.208
they just want us to eat

24:19.250 --> 24:20.251
in the daylight, you know

24:20.293 --> 24:21.543
so we could enjoy the view.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.795
It's getting

24:21.585 --> 24:22.795
kind of foggy out.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.504
It's still nice.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.966
I had no idea

24:24.546 --> 24:26.966
it would be this cold.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.217
I told you like a million times.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.136
But not this cold

24:28.259 --> 24:30.136
and it doesn't help

24:30.177 --> 24:32.179
that the heat in this place

24:30.177 --> 24:32.179
doesn't work very well.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.932
Well, your full line of vineyard

24:32.221 --> 24:34.932
swag should keep you toasty.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.392
This stuff is cheap as hell.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.517
The sweatpants I bought

24:36.434 --> 24:37.517
in the gym

24:37.559 --> 24:38.602
they've ripped already.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.354
- Logan.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.354
- Logan? What about him?

24:40.396 --> 24:41.897
Well, he's the reason

24:40.396 --> 24:41.897
they ripped

24:41.939 --> 24:43.481
the way he was

24:41.939 --> 24:43.481
playing out there.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.152
- How was he playing?

24:43.523 --> 24:46.152
- I don't know. Annoying.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.154
What was he doing,

24:46.193 --> 24:48.154
specifically, to annoy you?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.196
What wasn't he doing?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
He was mocking me, traveling

24:51.031 --> 24:53.575
fouling me without calling it,

24:51.031 --> 24:53.575
cheating on the score.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.869
And that spontaneously

24:53.617 --> 24:55.869
caused your pants to rip?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.579
You know what I mean.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.623
He seemed nice when you guys

24:57.621 --> 24:59.623
came back from the court.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.083
He said you were

24:59.665 --> 25:01.083
just playing for fun.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.835
It wasn't fun, believe me.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.420
Well, maybe you shouldn't

25:02.876 --> 25:04.420
have come with us to the gym.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.504
- Nobody forced you to go.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.504
- I know.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.341
I mean, it's

25:06.546 --> 25:08.341
Valentine's weekend, you know?

25:08.382 --> 25:09.925
How about we stop

25:08.382 --> 25:09.925
talking about the gym

25:09.967 --> 25:11.469
and the stupid basketball game?

25:11.509 --> 25:13.846
Sure, okay. Fine.

25:13.887 --> 25:14.888
Look, they're probably

25:13.887 --> 25:14.888
waiting for us.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.640
I'll just see you out there.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.476
You got it.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.273
I'm sorry, but this picture

25:21.895 --> 25:24.273
just does not compute.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.108
- Stop.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.108
- You're wielding a knife.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.943
That's verboten

25:26.150 --> 25:27.943
in Gilmore world.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.029
- You forget that I'm a rebel.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.029
- And you're wearing an apron.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.655
It's so my clothes

25:30.070 --> 25:31.655
don't get wrecked.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.949
You've not worn an apron since

25:31.697 --> 25:33.949
you saw "The Sound Of Music"

25:33.991 --> 25:35.701
and you put one on

25:33.991 --> 25:35.701
so you'd look like Sister Maria

25:35.742 --> 25:38.871
and you made a big crucifix

25:35.742 --> 25:38.871
out of popsicle sticks.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.373
- Wow.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.373
- What?

25:40.414 --> 25:42.540
You just went to that drawer

25:40.414 --> 25:42.540
and got that thingamabob

25:42.582 --> 25:43.917
like that's what

25:42.582 --> 25:43.917
you intended all along.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.543
- It was.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.543
- You know where things are.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.586
I've cooked here before.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.339
I may need to be resuscitated.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.049
Okay, do you want to help

25:48.381 --> 25:50.049
or you wanna keep on the riff?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.675
- I wanna help.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.675
- Okay.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.927
Logan is taking care

25:51.717 --> 25:53.927
of the lobsters for us outside

25:53.969 --> 25:56.638
and I am making a salad,

25:53.969 --> 25:56.638
mashed potatoes, and bruschetta.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.808
- Hmm. What's this?

25:56.680 --> 25:59.808
- It's a garlic press.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.060
This would definitely do a foot.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.478
Step away from the knife.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.313
- What's this?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.313
- That's a lemon zester.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.731
- 'Let me zest a lemon.'

26:04.355 --> 26:05.731
- 'No.'

26:05.772 --> 26:07.316
(Lorelai)

26:05.772 --> 26:07.316
'Well, I get to do something.'

26:07.358 --> 26:08.359
(Rory)

26:07.358 --> 26:08.359
'Well, you can't

26:07.358 --> 26:08.359
just grab things.'

26:08.401 --> 26:10.069
- 'Hi, Luke.'

26:08.401 --> 26:10.069
- Hey.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.320
Wash your hands

26:10.110 --> 26:11.320
and I will give you a task.

26:11.362 --> 26:12.863
- Excellent.

26:11.362 --> 26:12.863
- 'Food looks good.'

26:12.905 --> 26:14.448
Rory's gonna

26:12.905 --> 26:14.448
let me chop something.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.367
- Is that wise?

26:14.490 --> 26:16.367
- I did not say chop.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.827
- Alright, I'm all ready.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.827
- Okay. Chop the celery.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.205
Yay! Oh, that's a dinner knife.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.082
Well, be very careful, please.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.292
I am Mario Batali

26:23.123 --> 26:25.292
and Ina Garten's love child.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.960
(Rory)

26:25.334 --> 26:26.960
'Logan's outside

26:25.334 --> 26:26.960
dealing with the lobsters'

26:27.002 --> 26:29.171
if you wanna join him.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.171
He was very nice, by the way.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.672
He kept them well-hidden from me

26:30.714 --> 26:32.425
when they were,

26:30.714 --> 26:32.425
let's just say, not dead.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.842
Not dead?

26:33.884 --> 26:35.719
I don't like

26:33.884 --> 26:35.719
behind-the-scenes food stuff.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.222
I'll see

26:35.761 --> 26:38.222
what's going on out there.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.807
What did you mean,

26:38.264 --> 26:40.807
"It would do a foot?"

26:44.061 --> 26:45.396
(Logan)

26:44.061 --> 26:45.396
'Hey, they kick you

26:44.061 --> 26:45.396
out of the house?'

26:45.438 --> 26:46.980
- Kind of.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.980
- 'You like lobster?'

26:47.022 --> 26:48.566
I never had lobster.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.608
I think you'll like it

26:48.606 --> 26:50.608
if I don't screw it up.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.070
Making lobster is a time-honored

26:50.650 --> 26:53.070
Huntzberger family tradition.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.863
- It's in our blood.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.863
- Great.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.656
So FYI, I'm probably gonna do

26:54.905 --> 26:56.656
the present thing at dinner.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.824
The present thing?

26:57.866 --> 26:59.118
Just wanted

26:57.866 --> 26:59.118
to give you a heads-up.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.702
Don't wanna

26:59.159 --> 27:00.702
complicate your life.

27:00.744 --> 27:04.039
- You got Rory a present.

27:00.744 --> 27:04.039
- For Valentine's Day.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
- You forget?

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
- No.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.167
- 'Okay.'

27:06.083 --> 27:07.167
- I didn't get her anything.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.210
Oh.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.295
I mean, Valentine's Day

27:09.336 --> 27:10.921
isn't technically till Tuesday.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.630
- 'Sure.'

27:10.963 --> 27:12.630
- I have a couple of extra days.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.799
Right.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.594
Is there anything open nearby?

27:16.634 --> 27:18.053
Only if you wanna

27:16.634 --> 27:18.053
buy a windbreaker

27:18.095 --> 27:20.139
or some boating equipment.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.600
Look, I went a little nuts

27:20.180 --> 27:22.600
and got two things for Rory.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.934
Let me give you one

27:22.640 --> 27:23.934
to give to Lorelai.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.811
- No, no, no.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.811
- 'Yes.'

27:25.852 --> 27:27.187
I got a necklace

27:25.852 --> 27:27.187
and a tennis bracelet.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.688
She doesn't need both.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.857
- Take one, whichever one.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.857
- I can't do that.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.192
Dude, it's Valentine's Day.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.986
You've gotta give

27:32.234 --> 27:33.986
your girl a gift.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.990
- Well, maybe I will take one.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.990
- Which one?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.741
- How about the necklace?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.741
- Perfect.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.952
Mainly because I have no idea

27:39.783 --> 27:41.952
what a tennis bracelet is.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.245
Let me finish up

27:41.994 --> 27:43.245
getting these things on.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.913
I'll take you

27:43.287 --> 27:44.913
and show it to you.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.373
I left them in the car,

27:44.955 --> 27:46.373
so Rory wouldn't find them.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.041
You really

27:46.415 --> 27:48.041
don't have to do this.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.461
I'm happy too.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.461
We men got to stick together.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.754
Okay.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.798
(Lorelai)

27:52.796 --> 27:54.798
'This is fun.'

27:54.840 --> 27:56.800
You have got to stop doing that.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.595
- I love the squishy feeling.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.595
- You're gonna over mash them.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.514
Is there such a thing

27:59.637 --> 28:01.514
as over mashing potatoes?

28:01.555 --> 28:03.223
Yes, it's called potato soup.

28:03.265 --> 28:05.100
You know, you can

28:03.265 --> 28:05.100
put on the apron

28:05.142 --> 28:07.060
and shout out things

28:05.142 --> 28:07.060
like "Dice the carrots"

28:07.102 --> 28:08.479
but implying that

28:07.102 --> 28:08.479
you can over mash potatoes

28:08.521 --> 28:09.980
proves you're phony.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.482
You're the one

28:10.022 --> 28:11.482
who thought the potato masher

28:11.524 --> 28:14.318
was a waffle shaper

28:11.524 --> 28:14.318
before I corrected you.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.612
Ow, I think I'm giving myself

28:14.360 --> 28:16.612
mashed-potato elbow.

28:16.654 --> 28:17.655
Would you like

28:16.654 --> 28:17.655
more chef's juice?

28:17.695 --> 28:19.031
More wine would be great.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.240
So have I told you

28:19.072 --> 28:20.240
what we're thinking

28:20.282 --> 28:21.699
for the end of the school year?

28:21.741 --> 28:23.619
- What, who was thinking?

28:21.741 --> 28:23.619
- Logan and I.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.455
- Get this...Asia.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.455
- Asia, wow.

28:26.497 --> 28:30.042
Well, some of Asia.

28:26.497 --> 28:30.042
China, Thailand, Vietnam.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.251
We're thinking six weeks.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.710
Sounds exciting, hon.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.171
We haven't finalized

28:32.752 --> 28:34.171
anything yet

28:34.213 --> 28:35.964
but I bought the books,

28:34.213 --> 28:35.964
I'm doing the research.

28:36.006 --> 28:37.341
It's official.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.842
You've become too fabulous

28:37.383 --> 28:38.842
to hang out with me.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.135
How's it going in here?

28:40.177 --> 28:41.595
It's good. Hope you like

28:40.177 --> 28:41.595
remashed potatoes.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.638
You can eat them with a straw.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.681
Where are you two headed?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.931
I need the other tongs.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.183
They're buried somewhere

28:44.973 --> 28:46.183
in the garage.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.226
Luke was gonna

28:46.225 --> 28:47.226
help me find them.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.852
Right. We'll be right back.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.812
The clawed things out there,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.812
they went peacefully.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.314
Thank you.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.776
- It's weird, you know?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.776
- What's weird?

28:56.818 --> 28:58.445
I don't know, it just hit me.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.989
These could be the ones.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.282
The ones?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.784
The ones, you know?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.828
Yeah.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.081
Yeah.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.084
[instrumental music]

29:12.125 --> 29:13.669
Luke, weren't you

29:12.125 --> 29:13.669
a lobster neophyte?

29:13.711 --> 29:15.128
- Looks like you liked it.

29:13.711 --> 29:15.128
- It's good.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.089
I can't believe

29:15.170 --> 29:17.089
I've never had it before.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.965
- You cooked them perfect.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.965
- Here. Here.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.884
Thanks very much.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.884
You're too kind.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.678
And not that I'm hunting

29:20.926 --> 29:22.678
for my own compliment

29:22.720 --> 29:24.471
but that celery I cut, huh?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.557
Let's hear it

29:24.513 --> 29:26.557
for the celery chopper.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.808
Oh, this is so spontaneous

29:26.599 --> 29:28.808
and unexpected.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.936
Not quite loud enough.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.936
Thank you, thank you.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.312
So, should we clear?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.106
It's so pretty out here,

29:32.354 --> 29:34.106
sun will be down soon

29:34.147 --> 29:36.483
so before it gets dark,

29:34.147 --> 29:36.483
Happy Valentine's Day.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.111
Oh, my God,

29:36.525 --> 29:39.111
you humanely killed lobsters

29:39.152 --> 29:40.362
and you got me a present?

29:40.404 --> 29:42.906
I'm a multitasker.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.324
Huh! It's a bracelet.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.201
It's a tennis bracelet.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.911
You know

29:46.243 --> 29:47.911
what a tennis bracelet is?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.996
Well,

29:47.953 --> 29:49.996
my sister makes jewelry

29:50.038 --> 29:51.749
so I've picked up

29:50.038 --> 29:51.749
some terms.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.126
Wow, I love it.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.126
Happy Valentine's Day.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.461
Back at you, Ace.

29:55.502 --> 29:59.005
Well, I guess it's my turn.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.007
Happy Valentine's Day.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.593
- Really?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.593
- Really.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.807
[gasps]

30:05.638 --> 30:08.807
Oh, my God.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.807
Luke, it's beautiful.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.268
Good, good.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.268
It's gonna look great on you.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.019
Look at this.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.564
It's you.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.564
And it goes well with mine.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.065
Oh, yeah,

30:15.606 --> 30:17.065
they're almost matching.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.651
Yeah, Luke and I

30:17.107 --> 30:18.651
actually sneaked out

30:18.692 --> 30:20.026
when you two were playing

30:18.692 --> 30:20.026
around in the kitchen.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.236
We found those

30:20.068 --> 30:21.236
in the same place.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.862
Yep. Same shop.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.406
I can't believe you got me

30:22.904 --> 30:24.406
a Valentine's Day gift.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.575
- 'Is it getting kind of cold?'

30:24.448 --> 30:26.575
- Yeah, let's go in.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.619
We'll clear all this later.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.619
Let's build a fire and get warm.

30:28.661 --> 30:29.911
Excellent.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.666
- You like it?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.666
- I love it.

30:33.707 --> 30:34.874
Good.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.421
(Luke)

30:37.294 --> 30:39.421
'I really cannot believe

30:37.294 --> 30:39.421
I've never had lobster before.'

30:39.463 --> 30:41.715
'I love it. It's my favorite

30:39.463 --> 30:41.715
thing out of the sea now.'

30:41.757 --> 30:44.050
'It kicks tuna's ass,

30:41.757 --> 30:44.050
kicks salmon's ass.'

30:44.092 --> 30:45.511
Yeah, it's good stuff.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.262
'Logan did a good job

30:45.552 --> 30:47.262
with it too.'

30:47.304 --> 30:51.308
'We've gotta find a good lobster

30:47.304 --> 30:51.308
place near Stars Hollow.'

30:51.350 --> 30:52.976
Probably have to go

30:51.350 --> 30:52.976
to Litchfield, I'm not even

30:53.018 --> 30:55.437
gonna attempt the lobster-house

30:53.018 --> 30:55.437
pancake world.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.022
Do you know

30:55.479 --> 30:57.022
a good lobster place?

30:57.063 --> 30:59.358
Hmm.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.360
What's wrong?

30:59.399 --> 31:01.360
I thought you liked it.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.445
Oh, no, I-I do.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.445
It's beautiful.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.239
- So what is it?

31:03.487 --> 31:06.239
- I don't know.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.535
Lately, I've been feeling like

31:06.281 --> 31:09.535
it's just not gonna happen.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.870
- That what's not gonna happen?

31:09.576 --> 31:11.870
- Our wedding.

31:11.911 --> 31:15.708
No, Lorelai, that's crazy.

31:11.911 --> 31:15.708
Of course, it's going to happen.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.167
But do you really want it to?

31:17.209 --> 31:20.253
Yes. We're engaged.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.253
Uh, that hasn't changed.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.214
The wedding's just been

31:20.295 --> 31:22.214
postponed. That's all.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.007
It's not feeling

31:22.255 --> 31:24.007
like it's postponed.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.510
What happened? I-I thought

31:24.049 --> 31:26.510
this would make you happy.

31:26.552 --> 31:30.013
- It's making you sad.

31:26.552 --> 31:30.013
- No, it's not, it's just..

31:30.055 --> 31:32.307
I had to cancel

31:30.055 --> 31:32.307
a lot of stuff this week

31:32.349 --> 31:34.267
a lot of June third stuff.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.686
June third? But--

31:35.728 --> 31:37.855
Well, I was holding out

31:35.728 --> 31:37.855
hope that maybe

31:37.896 --> 31:39.648
if things calmed down

31:37.896 --> 31:39.648
with you a little bit

31:39.690 --> 31:41.608
it would still happen.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.608
It was just stupid.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.069
- No.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.069
- I lost all our deposits.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.655
That doesn't matter. We'll

31:44.110 --> 31:46.655
just put down new deposits.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.032
- Really?

31:46.697 --> 31:49.032
- We're getting married.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.659
I really wanna believe that.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.161
Look, I know

31:50.701 --> 31:53.161
I've been preoccupied.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.747
I don't like that about myself.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.374
It's just who I am,

31:54.788 --> 31:57.374
I get in my own head

31:57.416 --> 31:59.084
and I forget

31:57.416 --> 31:59.084
about the people around me.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.086
I-I know, that's why I thought

31:59.125 --> 32:01.086
this trip would be good

32:01.127 --> 32:02.880
for you, get you thinking

32:01.127 --> 32:02.880
about something else

32:02.921 --> 32:05.716
but it's been cold here,

32:02.921 --> 32:05.716
and-and Logan's been bugging you

32:05.758 --> 32:09.803
and the raccoon is noisy, and

32:05.758 --> 32:09.803
the waves were keeping you up.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.179
I think the trip

32:09.845 --> 32:11.179
was a dumb idea.

32:11.221 --> 32:14.474
Lorelai, no.

32:11.221 --> 32:14.474
It was a good idea.

32:14.516 --> 32:15.684
Hey..

32:17.895 --> 32:20.480
- What?

32:17.895 --> 32:20.480
- You know I love you, right?

32:20.522 --> 32:22.608
I really need to hear that

32:20.522 --> 32:22.608
once in a while.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.568
I love you,

32:22.649 --> 32:24.568
and I'm gonna marry you

32:24.610 --> 32:27.863
and at our wedding,

32:24.610 --> 32:27.863
we are having lobster.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.783
Okay.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.958
I really love this necklace.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.588
[instrumental music]

32:54.055 --> 32:55.891
- Morning.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.891
- Good morning.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.227
How did you sleep?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.897
I slept great.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.897
Better than I have in months.

33:01.939 --> 33:05.150
- How about you?

33:01.939 --> 33:05.150
- Wonderfully, actually.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.737
- It's so quiet out there.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.737
- Just the waves.

33:08.779 --> 33:11.949
- They didn't keep you up?

33:08.779 --> 33:11.949
- No, I slept like a rock.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.075
I wonder if Rory and Logan

33:11.990 --> 33:14.075
hit the gym again.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.368
I'm gonna go check.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.120
I wouldn't

33:15.410 --> 33:17.120
put it past them.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.164
Or maybe

33:17.162 --> 33:19.164
they went hang gliding

33:19.205 --> 33:21.166
and went to climb a mountain,

33:19.205 --> 33:21.166
you know.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.543
Pearl diving,

33:21.207 --> 33:23.543
or skeet shooting.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.545
[gasps]

33:23.585 --> 33:25.545
Wow!

33:25.587 --> 33:27.923
- 'What?'

33:25.587 --> 33:27.923
- Breakfast Santa's been here.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.801
Breakfast Santa? Wow.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.344
The kids must have left it

33:30.843 --> 33:32.344
for us.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.597
Well, I don't think there's

33:32.385 --> 33:35.597
really a breakfast Santa.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.683
So, how do we do this?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.018
Legs.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.020
Service here

33:40.059 --> 33:42.020
is so excellent.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.944
That must have been

33:46.274 --> 33:48.944
Harvey's beach.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.697
Well, last time I was

33:48.986 --> 33:51.697
at the beach, I was like 18.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.323
Oh, I was there,

33:51.738 --> 33:53.323
when I was a kid

33:53.365 --> 33:55.701
I used to go with my friend

33:53.365 --> 33:55.701
Trish and her family.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.828
It had that, uh, snack stand

33:55.742 --> 33:57.828
where the cute boy worked.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.830
Remember? He looked

33:57.870 --> 33:59.830
like Emilio Estevez.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.957
No, I remember

33:59.872 --> 34:01.957
the snack stand, not Emilio.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.083
We used to do cartwheels

34:01.999 --> 34:04.083
to get his attention.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.379
I remember my sister picking up

34:04.125 --> 34:07.379
someone's cigarette butt

34:07.420 --> 34:09.631
behind that stand

34:07.420 --> 34:09.631
and smoking it.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.466
Yeah, you know we could have

34:09.673 --> 34:11.466
been there at the same time

34:11.508 --> 34:12.885
on the same day.

34:11.508 --> 34:12.885
Isn't that weird?

34:12.926 --> 34:14.636
- Nah, we never were.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.636
- How do you know?

34:14.678 --> 34:18.139
'Cause you would have distracted

34:14.678 --> 34:18.139
me from the snack-stand guy.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.933
And no guy ever did.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.062
What about eloping?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.898
- What?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.898
- Eloping, we can do that right?

34:25.939 --> 34:27.482
Instead of planning

34:25.939 --> 34:27.482
this whole big thing?

34:27.524 --> 34:30.402
I don't know. Maybe.

34:27.524 --> 34:30.402
I guess we could.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.654
But Rory has to come. Is it

34:30.443 --> 34:32.654
still eloping if Rory comes?

34:32.696 --> 34:34.406
Sure, why not?

34:32.696 --> 34:34.406
Let's start planning it.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.324
You don't plan an elopement.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.324
You just do it.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.660
Oh, right, that makes sense,

34:36.366 --> 34:38.660
we could even come back

34:38.702 --> 34:40.245
and do it here

34:38.702 --> 34:40.245
when the weather's better.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.873
We could rent a place for

34:40.286 --> 34:42.873
a couple weeks in the summer.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.332
That sounds nice.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.251
[door slams]

34:44.374 --> 34:46.251
Whoa, loud.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.545
- Must be Rory and Logan.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.545
- In some kind of hurry.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.129
You guys, we're up here.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.799
In the interest of full

34:50.171 --> 34:52.799
disclosure, we're fairly casual.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.094
- Who are you?

34:56.135 --> 34:58.055
Mitchum Huntzberger.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.055
Who are you?

34:58.096 --> 35:00.306
Um, I'm Lorelai.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.306
I'm Rory's mother.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.392
I'm looking for my son.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.602
(Logan)

35:02.434 --> 35:03.602
'Dad!'

35:11.443 --> 35:13.486
- Where the hell have you been?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.486
- 'What are you doing here?'

35:13.528 --> 35:15.113
You turn off your cell,

35:13.528 --> 35:15.113
you turn off your pager.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.365
- I told you never turn off--

35:15.154 --> 35:17.365
- I got your pages.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.158
So you're ignoring them?

35:17.407 --> 35:19.158
That's great.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.702
(Logan)

35:19.200 --> 35:20.702
'We're gonna have it

35:19.200 --> 35:20.702
out in public?'

35:20.744 --> 35:22.913
We're not in public, Logan.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.913
We're in my house.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.289
Yeah, we're gonna

35:22.955 --> 35:24.289
have it out here.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.999
You didn't need me

35:24.330 --> 35:25.999
this weekend.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.085
You don't get to decide

35:26.041 --> 35:28.085
whether you're needed or not.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.920
I decide that.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.920
Do you hear me?

35:29.962 --> 35:32.171
- 'They heard you in Nantucket.'

35:29.962 --> 35:32.171
- 'You were not to be here.'

35:32.213 --> 35:33.673
You were supposed to be

35:32.213 --> 35:33.673
on a red-eye to London last--

35:33.715 --> 35:35.050
- How many times--

35:33.715 --> 35:35.050
- I have a room full of--

35:35.092 --> 35:36.635
I've met all of them.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.845
- Some of them actually come--

35:36.676 --> 35:38.845
- I've met these--

35:38.887 --> 35:40.722
And you blow it off to be

35:38.887 --> 35:40.722
with your little girlfriend?

35:40.764 --> 35:41.848
You embarrassed me!

35:41.890 --> 35:43.391
You wanna talk

35:41.890 --> 35:43.391
about embarrassment?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.102
You listen to me.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.436
You're getting

35:45.143 --> 35:46.436
on a plane to London.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.687
You're getting

35:46.478 --> 35:47.687
on a plane to London today.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.397
And you're gonna

35:47.729 --> 35:49.397
explain to my colleagues

35:49.439 --> 35:51.900
why you wasted their Saturday,

35:49.439 --> 35:51.900
and robbed them of their Sunday.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.610
And let me tell you this,

35:51.942 --> 35:53.610
you better start acclimating

35:53.652 --> 35:55.737
yourself because you're in

35:53.652 --> 35:55.737
London for at least a year

35:55.779 --> 35:57.781
starting the day after

35:55.779 --> 35:57.781
you graduate, as we discussed.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.825
- 'You discussed it.'

35:57.823 --> 35:59.825
- 'You're doing this, Logan.'

35:59.866 --> 36:02.035
And I'm driving you to

35:59.866 --> 36:02.035
the airport myself right now.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.912
Get packed.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.912
You've got ten minutes.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.330
I have guests.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.457
Your guests can stay.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.457
You're leaving.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.505
Excuse me.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.180
I guess we can just pick

36:20.512 --> 36:22.180
something up on the way.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.389
Yeah.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.267
Hey. Still here?

36:26.309 --> 36:28.394
Yeah, just waiting for Rory

36:26.309 --> 36:28.394
to get her things.

36:28.436 --> 36:31.106
You, uh, need any help there?

36:31.148 --> 36:32.858
- No, thanks, Luke.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.858
- No problem.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.776
I just have to get

36:32.899 --> 36:34.776
that last bag.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.111
Mmm.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.534
I'm really, really sorry

36:41.116 --> 36:42.534
about this.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.494
Oh, hey, it's okay.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.538
It was fun while it lasted.

36:50.249 --> 36:54.212
No one understands letting

36:50.249 --> 36:54.212
family down better than I do.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.381
- Hi.

36:56.422 --> 36:57.924
- Walk you out?

36:56.422 --> 36:57.924
- Yeah.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.648
Intimidating.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.653
So, a full year in London?

37:19.821 --> 37:21.573
Yeah.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.658
So when do you move exactly?

37:25.535 --> 37:27.787
The Asia thing..

37:27.829 --> 37:30.040
I guess

37:27.829 --> 37:30.040
that's on the back burner?

37:32.542 --> 37:34.836
Do you have to leave

37:32.542 --> 37:34.836
the very day after you graduate?

37:34.878 --> 37:38.006
- Or is there a cushion?

37:34.878 --> 37:38.006
- Stop. It's not happening.

37:38.048 --> 37:39.883
Okay? Not yet. It's February.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.300
We don't have to think

37:39.925 --> 37:41.300
about this right now.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.095
Right now, it doesn't

37:41.342 --> 37:43.095
even exist, okay?

37:43.136 --> 37:45.138
I'm not gonna think about it.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.138
Let's not think about it.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.765
- Okay.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.765
- Take the Porsche home.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.266
And keep planning Asia.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.936
- I've got all my books with me.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.936
- Good.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.200
So that's Mitchum, huh?

38:05.242 --> 38:07.202
It's just like

38:05.242 --> 38:07.202
I imagined him.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.838
- Hey, Caesar.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.838
- Luke, you're back early.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.339
- How was it?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.339
- Great.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.633
Uh, it ended dramatically.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.468
- But yeah.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.468
- Well, welcome back.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.053
There was something

38:23.509 --> 38:25.053
I was supposed to tell you.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.930
- Was it important?

38:25.095 --> 38:26.930
- Must not have been.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.807
Alright. Well, uh,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.807
I'll take care of out here.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.100
Why don't you close out

38:28.848 --> 38:30.100
the back?

38:30.142 --> 38:31.517
Sure. Coffee's fresh.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.270
- Maybe that was it.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.270
- Was that it?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.938
No.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.482
- Well, I'd love some coffee.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.482
- Comin' up.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.859
Okay. What am I gonna do

38:37.523 --> 38:39.859
with all that stuff?

38:39.901 --> 38:42.570
Keep it. It looked good on you,

38:39.901 --> 38:42.570
especially the sweatpants.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.489
You got nice Mass ass.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.532
- A what?

38:44.530 --> 38:46.532
- Massachusetts ass.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.326
Well, maybe

38:46.574 --> 38:48.326
I'll keep those then.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.536
I remember. Your daughter.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.536
I'm an idiot.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.164
- What?

38:50.578 --> 38:52.164
- That's what I had to tell you.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.206
April kept calling

38:52.205 --> 38:53.206
to confirm the time

38:53.248 --> 38:54.582
'she's coming over tomorrow.'

38:54.624 --> 38:56.084
- 'Oh, she did?'

38:54.624 --> 38:56.084
- 'Three o'clock.'

38:56.126 --> 38:57.710
She kept calling

38:56.126 --> 38:57.710
to remind me like I wouldn't

38:57.752 --> 38:59.587
remember to tell you,

38:57.752 --> 38:59.587
which I almost didn't.

38:59.629 --> 39:02.132
- She's pretty smart.

38:59.629 --> 39:02.132
- Yeah, thanks, Caesar.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.929
(Luke)

39:05.510 --> 39:07.929
'Uh..'

39:07.971 --> 39:11.390
So, three o'clock tomorrow.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.393
I guess her mother will pick her

39:11.432 --> 39:14.393
up around 7:00, so..

39:14.435 --> 39:18.439
Great. So, I'll pop up

39:14.435 --> 39:18.439
sometime after that.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.858
- Okay.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.858
- Oh, and her bike..

39:19.899 --> 39:21.860
- It's at my place.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.860
- 'Right.'

39:21.901 --> 39:24.070
Right, I guess I'll..

39:24.112 --> 39:25.822
...pick it up

39:24.112 --> 39:25.822
tomorrow before 3:00.

39:25.864 --> 39:29.117
Sure, anytime. You know,

39:25.864 --> 39:29.117
um, I'm just kinda tired.

39:29.159 --> 39:30.952
I don't need to wire

39:29.159 --> 39:30.952
myself up again.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.537
I think I'm just

39:30.994 --> 39:32.537
gonna go home.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.456
Oh, okay. I'll just tell

39:32.578 --> 39:35.456
Caesar I'm taking you.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.709
No, that's okay. That's okay.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.709
I think I'm gonna walk.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.045
- You sure?

39:37.750 --> 39:40.045
- Yeah, yeah, stay here.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.880
I'll get my bags tomorrow

39:40.086 --> 39:41.880
or you can, uh

39:41.921 --> 39:43.631
bring 'em when you come

39:41.921 --> 39:43.631
get April's bike.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.218
Sure, whatever you want.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.218
It's cold out there, you know?

39:46.259 --> 39:48.178
I know.

39:46.259 --> 39:48.178
Cold can be nice sometimes.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.846
- Alright.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.846
- See you tomorrow.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.056
Okay.
