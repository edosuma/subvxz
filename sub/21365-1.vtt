03:00.880 --> 03:02.214
Hi, sir.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.448
Just this.

03:04.551 --> 03:05.584
Four.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.187
Thank you.

03:22.669 --> 03:26.271
<i> Furthermore</i>
<i> this indemnification clause</i>

03:26.273 --> 03:29.508
<i> clearly states that there</i>
<i> will be no injunctive relief.</i>

03:30.710 --> 03:35.247
And our client's chances
of being rewarded

03:35.249 --> 03:37.916
financially are minimal
at best.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.722
I'll finish it tomorrow.

04:33.473 --> 04:33.472
<i> Can I be blamed for feeling</i>

04:33.474 --> 04:37.609
<i> that things were a little</i>
<i> strange that night?</i>

04:40.813 --> 04:44.750
<i> You don't expect</i>
<i> a power outage</i>
<i> in the spring.</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:46.852
<i> Not without a storm first.</i>

05:00.933 --> 05:03.302
<i> When you're tired</i>
<i> and it's a long day</i>

05:03.304 --> 05:05.504
<i> and you're trying</i>
<i> to get home</i>

05:05.506 --> 05:08.607
<i> you tend to feel all these</i>
<i> little disconnects</i>

05:08.609 --> 05:12.344
<i> as the slow trajectory</i>
<i> of a collapsing civilization.</i>

05:14.047 --> 05:16.548
<i> At least that's where I go.</i>

05:47.947 --> 05:52.017
<i> "In the suburbs,</i>
<i> we live in nature."</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:53.885
<i> That's a quote</i>
<i> from my realtor</i>

05:53.887 --> 05:55.954
<i> the selling phrase she used</i>
<i> when Diana and I</i>

05:55.956 --> 05:57.956
<i> first looked at this place.</i>

05:58.891 --> 05:58.890
Oh, crap.

05:58.892 --> 06:03.962
<i> And you do see</i>
<i> deer, rabbits, crows.</i>

06:03.964 --> 06:06.365
<i> But we don't live in nature.</i>

06:07.467 --> 06:09.768
<i> That's the point</i>
<i> of the suburbs.</i>

06:09.770 --> 06:12.437
<i> You live apart from humans.</i>

06:12.439 --> 06:14.740
<i> And you're protected</i>
<i> from what's wild.</i>

06:14.742 --> 06:16.708
Jesus.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.577
Go on, get out of here.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.711
Go on!

06:20.980 --> 06:22.981
Go on, get out!

06:25.952 --> 06:27.753
Oh, damn it.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.496
Oh, Christ.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.109
Oh, god. Damn it.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.620
Damn it.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.023
Alright.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.969
Ha! Ha! Go on.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.728
<i> I had quarreled with my wife.</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:54.165
<i> We did this thing</i>
<i> where we would play</i>

08:54.167 --> 08:55.667
<i> at sexual jealousy.</i>

08:59.605 --> 09:00.906
But anyway, um..

09:00.908 --> 09:03.008
<i> Or I played at it</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:05.010
<i> and she was my accomplice.</i>

09:05.012 --> 09:07.846
<i> After 15 years of marriage</i>

09:07.848 --> 09:09.948
<i> jealousy was</i>
<i> the reliable stimulant.</i>

09:11.951 --> 09:11.950
<i> Let's be honest.</i>

09:11.952 --> 09:17.088
<i> When your spouse gets</i>
<i> jealous, it's flattering.</i>

09:17.090 --> 09:20.258
<i> The blood stirs,</i>
<i> the heart pounds.</i>

09:20.260 --> 09:23.061
<i> We'd quarrel..</i>

09:23.063 --> 09:25.897
<i> ...and we'd have sex.</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:29.768
<i> Or as Diana would say</i>
<i> provocatively</i>

09:29.770 --> 09:31.803
<i> we'd fuck.</i>

09:31.805 --> 09:31.803
<i> And it works.</i>

09:31.805 --> 09:34.940
The guy you were coming
onto all afternoon.

09:34.942 --> 09:34.940
<i> Until it doesn't.</i>

09:34.942 --> 09:37.909
Obviously, I wasn't
coming on to him --

09:37.911 --> 09:39.611
oh, yeah, obviously.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.047
Well, Diana,
anyone within 10 feet

09:42.049 --> 09:43.982
could see what was going on.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.984
Well, who was watching?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.652
It was a conversation.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.088
I witnessed
the whole thing, Diana.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.824
You were practically
issuing him an invitation.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.660
Only in your peculiar
imagination, Wakefield.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.729
Meanwhile,
you'll chat up any woman

09:57.731 --> 09:59.631
who even looks at you
and I'm the one who --

09:59.633 --> 10:02.367
no, no, no. You made
a very suggestive remark.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.835
I made an amusing remark.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.236
Oh, amusing? Ah!

10:05.238 --> 10:07.238
Everyone laughed but you.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.175
Well, I failed
to be entertained
by watching my wife

10:10.177 --> 10:13.044
come onto a guy
in a Polo shirt.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.214
I was replying
to something he said.

10:16.216 --> 10:20.151
Something stupid
if you must know..

10:20.153 --> 10:20.151
God!

10:20.153 --> 10:25.223
I am so sick of this --
this constant surveillance.

10:25.225 --> 10:25.223
- You --
- whoa, whoa, whoa --

10:25.225 --> 10:28.960
no, you have muzzled me
to the point where I can't

10:28.962 --> 10:31.129
carry on a conversation
with other parents.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.931
I barely relate
to people anymore --

10:32.933 --> 10:36.101
- you were relating to him.
- What do you not see?

10:36.103 --> 10:38.269
I mean, do you think
I'd be even remotely
inclined to start

10:38.271 --> 10:40.805
something up
with anyone given
the relationship we have?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.010
All I want..

10:45.012 --> 10:47.112
...is to get through the day.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.649
That's what I think about.
Just get through the day.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.200
Unbelievable.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.313
<i> Why go in there now?</i>

11:55.315 --> 11:58.349
<i> Just to endure another</i>
<i> predictable scene</i>
<i> with my wife.</i>

11:59.318 --> 12:01.319
<i> Soon enough,</i>
<i> they'd all be asleep.</i>

13:00.079 --> 13:01.412
Oh.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.257
Oh.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.260
Oh, shit.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.263
Shit! Ah!

13:20.966 --> 13:22.267
<i> Oh, god.</i>

13:25.271 --> 13:26.437
Oh!

13:36.115 --> 13:38.449
<i> You know, frankly</i>
<i> I was totally bewildered</i>

13:38.451 --> 13:41.019
<i> by this situation</i>
<i> I had created for myself.</i>

13:43.190 --> 13:46.057
<i> Diana would probably think</i>
<i> I'd been with someone else.</i>

13:47.393 --> 13:48.893
<i> Not that I had ever</i>
<i> given her a reason</i>

13:48.895 --> 13:51.229
<i> to doubt me</i>
<i> in 15 years of marriage.</i>

13:52.331 --> 13:53.998
<i> Oh, my god.</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:57.001
<i> It would be</i>
<i> the weakest of tactics</i>

13:57.003 --> 13:59.370
<i> for me to walk into my house</i>

13:59.372 --> 14:01.105
<i> and try to explain to her</i>

14:01.107 --> 14:02.941
<i> the perfectly</i>
<i> rational sequence</i>

14:02.943 --> 14:05.310
<i> that led me to spend</i>
<i> the night in the garage.</i>

14:14.220 --> 14:16.287
<i> You know,</i>
<i> another woman might have</i>

14:16.289 --> 14:19.190
<i> saved my supper plate</i>
<i> in the refrigerator.</i>

14:19.192 --> 14:22.293
<i> But I lived</i>
<i> in Diana's judgment.</i>

14:22.295 --> 14:24.996
<i> It shone on me</i>
<i> as in a prison cell</i>

14:24.998 --> 14:27.465
<i> where the light</i>
<i> is never turned off.</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:35.206
<i> The immediate solution?</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:38.509
<i> Postpone my entrance 'til</i>
<i> my wife had gone off to work.</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:49.420
Mm.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.924
Rush, rush, rush.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.034
The bus is here, girls.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.204
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.172
They forgot their lunches.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.911
<i> Girls, girls, lunch.</i>

15:14.179 --> 15:16.447
<i> They're gonna be late again.</i>

15:18.251 --> 15:20.385
Bye-bye, girls.
Have a good day.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.053
<i> Okay, love you.</i>

15:30.462 --> 15:32.063
Oh, yeah.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.500
<i> The first call</i>
<i> would be to my office.</i>

15:35.502 --> 15:37.402
<i> No, he hasn't come in.</i>

15:38.637 --> 15:40.204
<i> No.</i>

15:40.206 --> 15:43.441
Yesterday evening.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.044
Well, no,
he didn't say anything.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.647
Mm-hmm. Well, he left around
the usual time.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.584
<i> Oh, yes, of course, I will.</i>

15:55.220 --> 15:56.421
Bye-bye.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.198
Oh, where are you going now?

16:15.207 --> 16:17.575
Surprise, car's still there.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.419
The plot thickens.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.136
<i> After a few calls</i>
<i> to her friends</i>

16:45.138 --> 16:47.438
<i> wouldn't it seem reasonable</i>
<i> to expect</i>

16:47.440 --> 16:50.708
<i> that the assistant curator</i>
<i> of the county museum</i>

16:50.710 --> 16:52.543
<i> would depart for work?</i>

16:54.013 --> 16:56.781
<i> I realize this is</i>
<i> a common enough complaint.</i>

16:56.783 --> 16:59.784
<i> But there are times when I</i>
<i> feel I've spent my life</i>

16:59.786 --> 17:01.352
<i> just waiting for my wife</i>

17:01.354 --> 17:03.421
<i> to get ready</i>
<i> to leave the house.</i>

17:12.297 --> 17:15.532
Oh, you got to be
fuckin' kidding me.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.061
Oh.

17:58.577 --> 17:58.576
What the hell?

18:03.348 --> 18:05.416
Wait a minute, wait a minute
wait a minute.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.690
Ah-ha!

18:14.694 --> 18:16.127
Yeah.

18:24.336 --> 18:25.503
<i> Ah-ha.</i>

18:26.738 --> 18:27.839
Yes, officer.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.508
<i> No checks were missing.</i>

18:31.710 --> 18:33.678
<i> Why, why! Where could he be?</i>

18:36.748 --> 18:38.249
<i> Ah. Oh.</i>

18:39.418 --> 18:41.486
There's the hubs.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.688
No wonder you want him back.
He's a stud.

18:51.163 --> 18:54.465
<i> Our town police</i>
<i> are well-paid and polite</i>

18:54.467 --> 18:56.501
<i> and not so different</i>
<i> from the rest of us</i>

18:56.503 --> 19:00.371
<i> in their distant relationship</i>
<i> to actual crime.</i>

19:01.608 --> 19:03.474
<i> Nobody mugged him</i>
<i> or anything.</i>

19:14.520 --> 19:15.853
What? What am I,
a travel agent?

19:20.692 --> 19:22.160
<i> I guarantee</i>
<i> he's at the strip club</i>

19:22.162 --> 19:24.162
<i> right now hangin' around.</i>

19:24.730 --> 19:26.164
Dickhead.

19:47.719 --> 19:48.819
<i> Uh-oh.</i>

19:49.922 --> 19:52.490
Here come the water works.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.648
Shit.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.991
<i> But then god help us.</i>

20:27.759 --> 20:29.560
<i> The widow, babs.</i>

20:30.262 --> 20:31.729
<i> Right on cue.</i>

20:33.265 --> 20:34.332
Christ.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.875
<i> Oh, god.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:48.746
Do you ever shut up?

20:51.016 --> 20:54.485
<i> No, no, no, no.</i>
<i> Don't cry, don't cry.</i>

20:54.487 --> 20:56.621
<i> No. He's not worth it.</i>

20:57.623 --> 20:58.789
There you go.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.727
I have big broad
shoulders, darling.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.896
And if you need to cry,
you just lay your head
right here.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.967
Broad shoulders.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.802
Like a fuckin' linebacker.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.807
I'll be here for you.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.509
<i> But, darling,</i>
<i> now is the time</i>

21:18.511 --> 21:21.379
that you need
to protect yourself.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.947
You do.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.815
Financially, I mean.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.889
<i> He could wipe you out.</i>

21:31.891 --> 21:33.924
<i> Oh, no, no, no.</i>

21:33.926 --> 21:38.529
<i> Mommy, the bank accounts</i>
<i> are secured.</i>

21:38.531 --> 21:40.498
Look.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.932
Look, look, look.

21:41.934 --> 21:42.767
You see?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.871
<i> If Howard was</i>
<i> going to leave me</i>

21:46.873 --> 21:49.573
<i> wouldn't he have cleared out</i>
<i> all the accounts?</i>

21:49.575 --> 21:51.909
<i> But he didn't.</i>

21:51.911 --> 21:53.944
<i> Well, just give him time.</i>
<i> He will.</i>

21:55.781 --> 21:57.048
You bitch.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.718
Oh, god, I wish I had

22:00.720 --> 22:02.586
a high-powered rifle
right now.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.856
<i> One shot.</i>

22:08.694 --> 22:10.928
That woman could be up here
for two days.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.667
<i> At this juncture,</i>
<i> it seems fair to point out</i>

22:49.669 --> 22:52.002
<i> if your spouse</i>
<i> had seemingly vanished</i>

22:52.004 --> 22:54.538
<i> would you go off</i>
<i> to work as usual?</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:57.375
<i> Are daily matters</i>
<i> so very goddamn urgent</i>

22:57.377 --> 22:59.710
<i> at the local county museum?</i>

22:59.712 --> 23:02.580
<i> Or was that desperate call</i>
<i> to the police a tactic</i>

23:02.582 --> 23:04.815
<i> calculated to embarrass me?</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:07.985
<i> Leave it to Mrs. Wakefield</i>

23:07.987 --> 23:09.954
<i> to turn a rather</i>
<i> amusing sidestep</i>

23:09.956 --> 23:11.956
<i> into prima facie evidence</i>

23:11.958 --> 23:14.825
<i> of Howard's</i>
<i> thoughtless behavior.</i>

23:14.827 --> 23:16.927
<i> I was naive</i>

23:16.929 --> 23:19.964
<i> and condescending</i>
<i> to her mother.</i>

23:19.966 --> 23:22.032
<i> I lacked interest</i>
<i> in her work.</i>

23:22.034 --> 23:25.736
<i> Or I wasted perfectly</i>
<i> beautiful full weekends</i>

23:25.738 --> 23:27.805
<i> watching football games.</i>

23:27.807 --> 23:30.040
<i> And if she was</i>
<i> such a feminist</i>

23:30.042 --> 23:32.109
<i> why did my opening</i>
<i> a door for her</i>

23:32.111 --> 23:36.013
<i> or helping her on</i>
<i> with her coat</i>
<i> matter so goddamn much?</i>

24:04.576 --> 24:06.877
<i> Standing there</i>
<i> in the clear light of day..</i>

24:08.447 --> 24:10.648
<i> I could see.</i>

24:10.650 --> 24:14.051
<i> Diana felt that she</i>
<i> had married the wrong man.</i>

25:19.284 --> 25:20.584
Oh.

25:23.788 --> 25:23.787
<i> I ask you</i>

25:23.789 --> 25:28.893
<i> what is so sacrosanct about</i>
<i> a marriage and a family</i>

25:28.895 --> 25:32.663
<i> that you should have to live</i>
<i> in it day after day</i>

25:32.665 --> 25:34.965
<i> however unrealized</i>
<i> that life may be?</i>

25:51.750 --> 25:55.019
<i> Who hasn't had the impulse</i>
<i> to just put their life</i>

25:55.021 --> 25:56.787
<i> on hold for a moment?</i>

25:58.089 --> 25:59.223
<i> I ask you.</i>

26:26.918 --> 26:28.819
Mm.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.988
<i> Oh, my god, that looks good.</i>

26:35.860 --> 26:37.995
<i> What are you two</i>
<i> doing laughing?</i>

26:39.164 --> 26:41.231
Assholes.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.234
Unh-unh-unh.
Here's the conspiracy.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.037
<i> It's all a little too</i>
<i> convenient, don't you think?</i>

26:47.039 --> 26:49.640
Oh, yes, I agree.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.642
I think she's totally guilty.

26:52.911 --> 26:54.712
She murdered him.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.054
Oh.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.225
Oh, no.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.161
Ben Jacobson, attorney at law

27:11.163 --> 27:12.896
just stoppin' by
for a little deli.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.798
Hello, Ben.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
<i> You're not fooling anybody.</i>

27:20.872 --> 27:23.173
<i> I say, without shame</i>

27:23.175 --> 27:26.176
<i> I'd given not</i>
<i> a single thought</i>
<i> to anyone at work.</i>

27:27.912 --> 27:30.180
<i> And the documents</i>
<i> I carried away with me.</i>

27:30.182 --> 27:33.283
<i> Documents, vital</i>
<i> to a very lucrative case</i>

27:33.285 --> 27:35.085
<i> we'd been preparing.</i>

27:35.087 --> 27:38.088
<i> All of that</i>
<i> was pretty remote now.</i>

27:39.424 --> 27:40.824
Well..

27:42.127 --> 27:44.361
<i> ...I've got my own</i>
<i> little deli going here.</i>

28:18.930 --> 28:20.431
Oh, my god.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.167
Here I am.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.250
Ta-dah!

28:52.363 --> 28:53.497
<i> Oh, right.</i>

28:54.399 --> 28:56.366
Make her the victim.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.878
Oh, please.
They've hardly been abandoned.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.780
People, I'm right here.

29:36.841 --> 29:38.242
<i> Oh, I see.</i>

29:39.544 --> 29:40.911
Here it is.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.781
Making your play, huh, Ben?

29:45.016 --> 29:46.416
<i> Go on, go on, go on. Go, on.</i>

29:46.418 --> 29:48.352
She's hurting.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.320
Give her your hanky,
be a gentleman.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.993
Oh, my god.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.495
He..

30:00.132 --> 30:02.366
He took out his phone.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.967
What an ass.

31:09.334 --> 31:12.569
A husband doesn't just vanish,
Mrs. Wakefield.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.309
<i> Howard Wakefield</i>
<i> is on this earth.</i>

31:22.313 --> 31:23.380
Or under it.

31:24.582 --> 31:27.618
And only you, madam,
know which it is.

31:36.160 --> 31:40.163
<i> Are you accusing me</i>
<i> of making a game of this?</i>

31:40.165 --> 31:43.433
<i> I assure you my frame of mind</i>
<i> was quite rational.</i>

31:44.969 --> 31:46.536
<i> May I remind you</i>

31:46.538 --> 31:49.373
<i> I was eating actual garbage</i>
<i> to survive?</i>

32:26.544 --> 32:28.011
<i> Oh.</i>

32:31.582 --> 32:32.950
Come on back.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.719
Come on, honey, come back,
come back.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.521
Come back,
come back, come back.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.525
<i> There you are.</i>

32:44.229 --> 32:46.697
<i> About my wife's</i>
<i> deliberate nudity.</i>

32:48.132 --> 32:50.200
<i> Apparently</i>
<i> it's a side effect of her</i>

32:50.202 --> 32:52.736
<i> having once been</i>
<i> a modern dancer.</i>

32:52.738 --> 32:55.138
<i> Briefly.</i>
<i> I feel compelled to add.</i>

32:56.541 --> 32:59.409
Who exactly are you trying
to attract out there?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.645
No one can see me
and if they can, I don't care.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.246
Uh, clearly.

33:03.248 --> 33:06.350
Strutting around this house
on full display.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.986
Would it kill you
to put some clothes on

33:08.988 --> 33:10.387
in front of our girls?

33:10.389 --> 33:11.621
No, I'm not gonna
teach our daughters

33:11.623 --> 33:13.256
to have shame
about having a body.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.659
What if I started
parading naked
around them, huh?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.627
What'd you think about that?
Hey, look at me!

33:17.629 --> 33:19.463
Whoo, daddy's naked!

33:19.465 --> 33:21.198
Mr. prude-o in the nude-o.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.500
Hey, look at me,
I'm going to work naked!

33:23.502 --> 33:24.568
Right, right, right.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.004
Jesus.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.373
Would you get away from there?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.375
<i> There's no one there, Howard.</i>

33:42.053 --> 33:43.487
Oh.

33:47.693 --> 33:52.529
<i> Seeing my wife in the nude,</i>
<i> oddly enough</i>

33:52.531 --> 33:54.564
<i> usually got me</i>
<i> thinking about money.</i>

33:58.102 --> 34:00.804
<i> I've only a slender amount</i>
<i> of cash with me.</i>

34:00.806 --> 34:04.107
<i> And if it's my intention</i>
<i> to vanish completely</i>

34:04.109 --> 34:06.643
<i> using a credit card</i>
<i> is out of the question.</i>

34:10.281 --> 34:12.516
<i> I could pre-date a bank check</i>

34:12.518 --> 34:15.118
<i> and cash it somewhere, yes.</i>

34:15.120 --> 34:16.686
<i> But that might signal</i>
<i> to Diana</i>

34:16.688 --> 34:19.589
<i> that my disappearance</i>
<i> was pre-meditated.</i>

34:19.591 --> 34:23.226
<i> Which, I don't know,</i>
<i> seems unnecessarily cool.</i>

35:15.880 --> 35:18.682
<i> It's not difficult</i>
<i> to run away.</i>

35:18.684 --> 35:20.750
<i> People ditch their families</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

35:24.255 --> 35:26.690
<i> But if this were</i>
<i> a simple abandonment of wife</i>

35:26.692 --> 35:30.460
<i> and children, I'd have</i>
<i> written Diana a note</i>

35:30.462 --> 35:33.196
<i> taken my car out</i>
<i> of the garage</i>

35:33.198 --> 35:36.600
<i> driven to Manhattan,</i>
<i> checked into a hotel</i>

35:36.602 --> 35:38.335
<i> and walked to work</i>
<i> in the morning.</i>

35:38.337 --> 35:40.570
<i> Easy. Anyone can do that.</i>

35:45.610 --> 35:48.578
<i> But you'd still be</i>
<i> the same person.</i>

35:51.749 --> 35:53.483
<i> This is different.</i>

36:02.493 --> 36:04.294
<i> You see..</i>

36:04.296 --> 36:06.630
<i> ...i no longer seem</i>
<i> to require those things</i>

36:06.632 --> 36:09.733
<i> that only days ago</i>
<i> were so indispensable.</i>

36:09.735 --> 36:12.502
<i> The armor of a clean shirt</i>

36:12.504 --> 36:13.803
<i> the smooth shave</i>

36:13.805 --> 36:16.606
<i> credit cards, cellphones</i>

36:16.608 --> 36:17.674
<i> clients.</i>

36:20.611 --> 36:23.346
<i> There will be no more</i>
<i> getting on that train.</i>

36:33.724 --> 36:35.659
<i> I'll take nothing more</i>
<i> from her.</i>

36:36.894 --> 36:38.495
<i> Nothing from that house.</i>

36:39.597 --> 36:40.597
<i> Ever.</i>

36:45.336 --> 36:47.671
<i> I'll sustain myself</i>
<i> like a castaway.</i>

36:49.540 --> 36:50.674
<i> A survivor.</i>

36:52.543 --> 36:53.810
<i> Undetected.</i>

36:58.749 --> 36:58.748
<i> Unshackled.</i>

37:01.319 --> 37:03.353
<i> I'll become</i>
<i> the Howard Wakefield</i>

37:03.355 --> 37:04.754
<i> I was meant to be.</i>

37:10.895 --> 37:12.662
<i> Oh, please.</i>

37:12.664 --> 37:14.864
<i> You've imagined doing this</i>
<i> yourself. I know you have.</i>

37:18.736 --> 37:20.870
<i> But what about</i>
<i> the twins you ask?</i>

37:20.872 --> 37:22.472
<i> No regrets there.</i>

37:23.741 --> 37:25.442
<i> In their current phase</i>

37:25.444 --> 37:27.344
<i> our girls generally</i>
<i> think of me</i>

37:27.346 --> 37:29.646
<i> as some kind</i>
<i> of unfortunate oddity</i>

37:29.648 --> 37:31.815
<i> who embarrasses them</i>
<i> in front of their friends.</i>

37:33.651 --> 37:35.719
<i> Believe me</i>

37:35.721 --> 37:37.721
<i> I'm seeing more</i>
<i> of these two now</i>

37:37.723 --> 37:39.789
<i> than I have in months,</i>
<i> if not years.</i>

37:42.293 --> 37:44.828
<i> And I'm sure</i>
<i> it's not lost on you.</i>

37:44.830 --> 37:47.831
<i> Though I might have</i>
<i> left my wife</i>

37:47.833 --> 37:49.799
<i> I'll still be able</i>
<i> to keep an eye on her.</i>

38:20.531 --> 38:21.598
Ah.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.968
There we go.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.906
<i> Did I ever miss</i>
<i> the conveniences of home?</i>

39:36.908 --> 39:38.141
Oh!

39:39.610 --> 39:40.910
Yeah.

39:41.812 --> 39:42.946
<i> No TV..</i>

39:44.014 --> 39:45.615
<i> ...no problem.</i>

39:47.852 --> 39:51.454
<i> Our neighbor, Dr. sondervan,</i>
<i> is a known authority</i>

39:51.456 --> 39:54.524
<i> on down syndrome and other</i>
<i> developmental disorders.</i>

39:57.895 --> 39:59.829
<i> When he began</i>
<i> to board some patients</i>

39:59.831 --> 40:03.066
<i> a few months at a time,</i>
<i> I stood up for sondervan</i>

40:03.068 --> 40:05.168
<i> when our neighbors</i>
<i> petitioned against him.</i>

40:14.078 --> 40:16.012
Shit!

40:16.014 --> 40:16.880
<i> God.</i>

40:27.925 --> 40:30.960
<i> My spirited defense</i>
<i> of Dr. sondervan</i>

40:30.962 --> 40:33.096
<i> and his young charges</i>
<i> for once gave me</i>

40:33.098 --> 40:35.098
<i> the moral high ground</i>
<i> with Diana</i>

40:35.100 --> 40:38.034
<i> who naturally</i>
<i> took the opposing view.</i>

40:38.036 --> 40:38.034
<i> Howard, really?</i>

40:38.036 --> 40:43.206
<i> Do we have any idea what</i>
<i> goes on behind those gates?</i>

40:43.208 --> 40:46.075
<i> And the apparent answer</i>
<i> to your wife is</i>

40:46.077 --> 40:48.945
<i> not too goddam much.</i>

40:48.947 --> 40:51.514
<i> Morning's a little</i>
<i> social interaction.</i>

40:51.516 --> 40:54.117
<i> Evenings conclude</i>
<i> with a hot shower.</i>

40:55.486 --> 40:57.954
<i> And who can argue with that?</i>

41:27.485 --> 41:29.118
There you are.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.059
Oh. That's so easy, isn't it?

41:36.061 --> 41:39.028
<i> In every marriage,</i>
<i> there's a division of labor.</i>

41:39.030 --> 41:40.864
<i> Mine and yours.</i>

41:40.866 --> 41:43.867
<i> By Diana's artful calibration</i>

41:43.869 --> 41:47.103
<i> her tasks occur</i>
<i> only inside the house.</i>

41:47.105 --> 41:49.873
<i> Children, cleaning,</i>
<i> provisioning.</i>

41:49.875 --> 41:51.808
<i> Oh, which means shopping.</i>

41:51.810 --> 41:53.676
<i> Lots of shopping.</i>

41:53.678 --> 41:56.045
<i> But anything external,</i>
<i> the roof</i>

41:56.047 --> 41:57.981
<i> the gutters,</i>
<i> the chimney, trash</i>

41:57.983 --> 42:01.718
<i> you know, servicing the cars,</i>
<i> that's all left to me.</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:01.718
<i> Her duties end at the door.</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:06.155
<i> And of course,</i>
<i> any labor accomplished</i>
<i> outside the house</i>

42:06.157 --> 42:08.558
<i> is invisible to my wife.</i>

42:08.560 --> 42:11.294
<i> Paying the bills, invisible.</i>

42:11.296 --> 42:14.831
<i> Property taxes,</i>
<i> life insurance</i>

42:14.833 --> 42:18.668
<i> home insurance</i>
<i> and of course, our mortgage.</i>

42:18.670 --> 42:21.104
<i> All faithfully and invisibly</i>

42:21.106 --> 42:24.541
<i> taken care of</i>
<i> by one Howard Wakefield.</i>

42:24.543 --> 42:27.176
<i> Now quite possibly deceased.</i>

42:29.146 --> 42:30.146
Celebration.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.016
One, two, three, four, five.

42:35.319 --> 42:36.786
Party?

42:39.123 --> 42:42.058
P-a-r-t-y.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.126
Yeah.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.661
Tsk. Monday.

42:52.136 --> 42:54.304
Who the hell is this?

43:02.179 --> 43:05.181
Oh, my god. Ben Jacobs.

43:07.084 --> 43:10.086
<i> Oh, yes, yes, yes, uh-huh.</i>

43:10.754 --> 43:12.221
You dog.

43:14.024 --> 43:16.659
<i> Coffee? Cookies? Come on in.</i>

43:17.828 --> 43:19.329
Oh, he's gonna need
some whitener

43:19.331 --> 43:21.664
for his coffee, Diana.

43:21.666 --> 43:25.001
Uh, excuse me, you don't
have any soy milk, do you?

43:25.003 --> 43:26.769
Of course, she's got soy milk.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.237
She's got everything.

43:31.175 --> 43:34.611
Please, Ben,
please tell her

43:34.613 --> 43:37.947
about your tragic
lactose intolerance.

43:37.949 --> 43:41.384
All the bloating
and flatulence.

43:57.201 --> 43:59.335
<i> Ah-ha!</i>

43:59.337 --> 44:02.238
Little pro-bono work
on behalf of the firm.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.273
How nice of you.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.144
<i> I'm impressed.</i>

44:24.294 --> 44:27.063
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I never used to sing.</i>

44:27.065 --> 44:29.198
<i> I think that's worth noting.</i>

44:32.903 --> 44:34.170
<i> If I sign this..</i>

44:35.439 --> 44:38.041
...it's declaring
my husband absentee.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.778
What if I don't sign?

44:43.047 --> 44:45.214
Would it make him
any less absent?

44:54.291 --> 44:57.060
You've got to be kidding me.

44:57.062 --> 44:59.762
<i> Right away with the..</i>

44:59.764 --> 45:01.330
<i> Come on, honey.</i>

45:01.332 --> 45:03.332
<i> Show him the door. Show it.</i>

45:05.736 --> 45:08.271
<i> Yes, yes.</i>

45:10.909 --> 45:14.343
Oh, Ben, you're such a douche.

45:15.245 --> 45:18.347
She is totally
out of your league.

45:18.349 --> 45:20.049
<i> Attagirl!</i>

45:27.357 --> 45:29.292
That's for you, dickhead.

45:33.797 --> 45:35.832
Yeah.

45:35.834 --> 45:39.035
<i> Absentee or no,</i>
<i> it's a victory, I guess</i>

45:39.037 --> 45:41.204
<i> to know I've still got</i>
<i> possession of my wife.</i>

45:43.407 --> 45:46.008
<i> Which reminds me,</i>
<i> I believe you're aware</i>

45:46.010 --> 45:48.111
<i> that Diana was something</i>
<i> of a dancer.</i>

45:50.514 --> 45:52.749
<i> By the time we met,</i>
<i> of course</i>

45:52.751 --> 45:55.318
<i> Diana's brief flirtation</i>
<i> with the stage</i>

45:55.320 --> 45:57.186
<i> had been replaced</i>
<i> by the occasional</i>

45:57.188 --> 45:58.955
<i> evening bar class.</i>

45:58.957 --> 46:02.358
<i> While she pursued a graduate</i>
<i> degree in art history</i>

46:02.360 --> 46:05.261
<i> and complicated her life</i>
<i> in the usual ways.</i>

46:07.798 --> 46:10.800
<i> Did I tell you she was</i>
<i> involved with someone else</i>

46:10.802 --> 46:12.468
<i> when she started seeing me?</i>

46:14.139 --> 46:17.140
<i> Dirk, dirk morrison.</i>

46:17.142 --> 46:20.109
Without touchin' the dime
or the bottle

46:20.111 --> 46:23.412
and usin' only one finger,
get the dime into the bottle.

46:23.414 --> 46:26.883
<i> We met in the city</i>
<i> through an alumni mix</i>
<i> and hit it off.</i>

46:26.885 --> 46:29.152
<i> A few years later,</i>
<i> my firm did some work</i>

46:29.154 --> 46:30.853
<i> for his</i>
<i> capital investment firm.</i>

46:30.855 --> 46:32.255
I thought you were smart.

46:33.490 --> 46:35.491
<i> I guess he'd say</i>
<i> we were friends.</i>

46:35.493 --> 46:36.959
- Where's the $5?
- Well done.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.995
I didn't bet you $5 on that.

46:38.997 --> 46:43.299
<i> There was nothing</i>
<i> dirk couldn't turn</i>
<i> into a competition.</i>

46:43.301 --> 46:45.034
<i> Fuck, yeah!</i>

46:45.036 --> 46:47.236
- What else you got?
- I can't hear ya.

46:49.173 --> 46:49.172
Thank you very much.

46:49.174 --> 46:52.441
<i> And I'm not defending</i>
<i> my own actions</i>

46:52.443 --> 46:54.377
<i> but dirk's competitiveness</i>

46:54.379 --> 46:56.946
<i> brought out a certain</i>
<i> quality in me.</i>

46:56.948 --> 46:59.415
So before your very eyes..

46:59.417 --> 47:01.384
...I'm gonna make this widget

47:01.386 --> 47:04.353
leave this bottle
without touching the bottle

47:04.355 --> 47:06.589
or the widget in any way.

47:07.324 --> 47:09.025
Should we stand back?

47:10.961 --> 47:13.196
- Whoa!
- Oh, ow!

47:15.300 --> 47:17.333
Oh, shit.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.469
<i> I had never had a thing</i>
<i> for dancers myself</i>

47:20.471 --> 47:25.141
<i> but somehow dirk's</i>
<i> intense interest in Diana</i>

47:25.143 --> 47:27.143
<i> gave me ideas of my own.</i>

47:34.484 --> 47:36.219
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

47:36.221 --> 47:38.054
- Diana.
- Oh, yes, of course. Hi.

47:38.056 --> 47:38.054
- Hi.
- How are you?

47:38.056 --> 47:41.324
<i> At first, she wouldn't</i>
<i> go out with me.</i>

47:41.326 --> 47:44.393
I'm seeing
a good friend of yours.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.229
Dirk morrison.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.564
I'm -- I'm dating dirk.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.099
<i> The thing to remember is</i>

47:50.101 --> 47:51.968
<i> I'm a litigator</i>
<i> by profession.</i>

47:51.970 --> 47:54.237
<i> I have a talent</i>
<i> for persuasion.</i>

47:59.410 --> 48:02.945
<i> Not that she ran to dirk</i>
<i> with the news.</i>

48:08.386 --> 48:10.987
<i> I had just been made</i>
<i> a senior partner</i>
<i> at the firm.</i>

48:10.989 --> 48:13.189
<i> Dirk was grinding away</i>
<i> at wall street.</i>

48:13.191 --> 48:15.558
<i> So busy people, right?</i>

48:15.560 --> 48:18.895
<i> It took a while</i>
<i> for dirk to find out.</i>

48:21.298 --> 48:23.900
Howard, you are jokin'
right now?

48:23.902 --> 48:26.235
No, no, she..

48:26.237 --> 48:28.304
She wanted to get out
and I thought great.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.439
So we went for a bike ride
in central park.

48:30.441 --> 48:30.439
<i> It was nice.</i>

48:30.441 --> 48:35.144
Little lunch
at the -- at the boat house.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.446
- That is total bullshit.
- Here. Here's your light beer.

48:37.448 --> 48:39.348
Cheers.

48:39.350 --> 48:40.683
I mean, let's be serious,
it's not as if

48:40.685 --> 48:43.119
anything is happening
with you.

48:43.121 --> 48:44.987
That's bollocks.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.390
Howard, we have a thing.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.392
We -- we have
an understanding.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.929
- An understanding?
- Yeah.

48:52.931 --> 48:56.399
Dirk, I mean,
you're not even fucking her.

48:56.401 --> 48:59.135
Last week, you told me
not to rouse her.

48:59.137 --> 48:59.135
- That means.. Jesus.
- Yes.

48:59.137 --> 49:03.239
A woman like Diana
cannot be pushed.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.340
You need to gain her trust.

49:04.342 --> 49:05.541
Wait, did you -- did you
tell Diana

49:05.543 --> 49:07.610
that I gave you permission
to ask her out?

49:09.680 --> 49:11.580
- What?
- Just tell me.

49:11.582 --> 49:12.949
Jesus.

49:14.584 --> 49:16.118
No.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.422
Come on, dirk.
She was just not happy.

49:19.424 --> 49:22.124
She didn't wanna tell you
what really happened.

49:24.094 --> 49:25.594
She's protecting you.

49:28.532 --> 49:29.598
Honest.

49:32.536 --> 49:35.004
<i> I lied, of course.</i>

49:35.006 --> 49:37.273
<i> Diana was torn between us.</i>

49:38.475 --> 49:42.745
<i> The drama went on for,</i>
<i> god, for weeks at least.</i>

49:42.747 --> 49:44.580
It's okay.

49:46.516 --> 49:48.451
<i> Why she'd never gone to bed</i>
<i> with dirk</i>

49:48.453 --> 49:52.521
<i> was I had made my move early</i>
<i> on in time to hit it off.</i>

49:53.623 --> 49:55.358
<i> But in those early weeks</i>

49:55.360 --> 49:57.326
<i> she wasn't</i>
<i> sleeping with me either.</i>

49:58.228 --> 49:59.662
It's okay.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.597
<i> Till I made a genius</i>

50:01.599 --> 50:04.633
<i> and I mean</i>
<i> genius strategic move.</i>

50:04.635 --> 50:06.535
I mean,
whatever she's telling you

50:06.537 --> 50:09.505
she is certainly
not asking me to back up.

50:11.241 --> 50:11.240
I don't know.

50:14.745 --> 50:18.647
What she says is that
she really cares about me.

50:20.084 --> 50:21.617
What?

50:21.619 --> 50:23.486
That is Diana

50:23.488 --> 50:25.554
the queen
of mixed signals, huh?

50:26.590 --> 50:28.524
Hey, maybe she's playing
us both.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.594
You know, in bed last night

50:31.596 --> 50:34.163
she started talking about
moving in with me

50:34.165 --> 50:36.132
and I went seriously?

50:36.134 --> 50:37.800
I'm thinking,
i really like you

50:37.802 --> 50:40.469
but aren't we moving
a little too fast with this?

50:40.471 --> 50:41.637
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:42.572 --> 50:44.173
She -- she's not..

50:45.409 --> 50:47.376
She's -- she's not
sleeping with you?

50:50.514 --> 50:52.415
Yeah, of course.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.519
What? She didn't say
anything to you?

50:58.255 --> 50:59.722
Oh, my god.

51:03.193 --> 51:04.360
Diana.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.763
<i> Genius, right?</i>

51:07.765 --> 51:10.266
<i> I knew dirk would do</i>
<i> something stupid.</i>

51:16.373 --> 51:18.541
Wait, wait, no. Stop.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.243
Stop it.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.345
<i> Within hours,</i>
<i> it had all played out.</i>

51:24.714 --> 51:26.148
Hey, how are you?

51:30.220 --> 51:33.489
- Oh.
- How is it? Is it bad?

51:33.491 --> 51:35.691
- Oh.
- Yeah, I know.

51:35.693 --> 51:38.561
I'm so sorry.

51:38.563 --> 51:40.563
Ooh.

51:40.565 --> 51:42.298
- No, no, no.
- I'm sorry.

51:42.300 --> 51:43.365
That feels better.

51:44.468 --> 51:45.634
Just leave it there a second.

51:47.772 --> 51:49.572
I have never seen
this side of him before.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.707
This violence.

51:51.709 --> 51:53.609
Ah, I'm not so surprised.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.411
I've known this guy
a long time.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.747
Has the swelling gone down?

51:58.749 --> 52:00.816
- No.
- Oh.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.518
Oh, poor baby.

52:05.822 --> 52:08.390
Hmm. That's better.

52:10.327 --> 52:12.361
That's even more better.

52:27.611 --> 52:30.446
<i> And thank you, dirk morrison.</i>

52:38.455 --> 52:38.454
<i> Would I have wanted her</i>

52:38.456 --> 52:41.490
<i> if she weren't</i>
<i> my best friend's girl?</i>

52:43.260 --> 52:45.761
<i> Was I just jacked up</i>
<i> by the competition?</i>

52:46.796 --> 52:48.664
<i> Yeah, well..</i>

52:49.799 --> 52:49.798
<i> ...it did occur to me</i>

52:49.800 --> 52:53.269
<i> about a year</i>
<i> into the marriage.</i>

52:56.940 --> 52:59.808
<i> But by then,</i>
<i> your wife is pregnant.</i>

52:59.810 --> 53:01.777
<i> She's carrying your child.</i>

53:01.779 --> 53:04.780
<i> And god, I don't know.</i>

53:04.782 --> 53:07.816
<i> She was just so beautiful.</i>

53:07.818 --> 53:09.818
<i> All over again.</i>

53:12.756 --> 53:16.959
<i> It makes you go</i>
<i> a little crazy and stuff.</i>

53:16.961 --> 53:19.828
<i> Oh, that gorgeous</i>
<i> round belly.</i>

53:21.198 --> 53:23.465
<i> It awakens this</i>
<i> whole other level of..</i>

53:24.267 --> 53:27.703
<i> ...well, fear, I guess.</i>

53:27.705 --> 53:29.838
<i> You wanna capture</i>
<i> her somehow.</i>

53:32.409 --> 53:34.210
<i> You see,</i>
<i> this is how they get you.</i>

53:34.212 --> 53:36.679
<i> They maneuver things</i>
<i> to that point</i>

53:36.681 --> 53:38.714
<i> where you feel like</i>
<i> everything in your life</i>

53:38.716 --> 53:41.650
<i> is suddenly precious.</i>

53:41.652 --> 53:44.720
<i> And -- and simultaneously,</i>
<i> totally precarious.</i>

53:45.889 --> 53:48.390
<i> It just slams you.</i>

53:49.726 --> 53:51.560
<i> The realization</i>
<i> that everything</i>

53:51.562 --> 53:54.697
<i> with any meaning,</i>
<i> anything you love</i>

53:54.699 --> 53:57.666
<i> could just be taken away</i>
<i> in some random event.</i>

54:02.672 --> 54:05.307
<i> Anything could happen, right?</i>

54:07.644 --> 54:08.711
<i> Anything.</i>

54:11.381 --> 54:13.716
<i> If I had left her</i>
<i> in the conventional sense</i>

54:13.718 --> 54:15.884
<i> if I had divorced her</i>

54:15.886 --> 54:17.686
<i> no one would blame my wife</i>

54:17.688 --> 54:20.723
<i> if she began entertaining</i>
<i> hoards of men.</i>

54:20.725 --> 54:24.326
<i> But by simply vanishing,</i>
<i> I placed Diana</i>

54:24.328 --> 54:27.296
<i> in a, let's say,</i>
<i> a distant category.</i>

54:29.032 --> 54:31.834
<i> Till it's known</i>
<i> what's become of her husband</i>

54:31.836 --> 54:36.038
<i> Mrs. Wakefield remains</i>
<i> not quite available.</i>

54:37.974 --> 54:39.808
<i> A power move.</i>

54:39.810 --> 54:41.810
<i> Am I intentionally</i>
<i> frustrating her?</i>

54:42.879 --> 54:45.547
<i> Not at all, my love.</i>

54:45.549 --> 54:47.816
<i> I'm sure</i>
<i> you have vivid memories</i>

54:47.818 --> 54:49.885
<i> of what you're missing.</i>

54:49.887 --> 54:51.920
<i> I know I do.</i>

54:54.791 --> 54:58.527
<i> I just want you to want me</i>

54:58.529 --> 55:00.663
<i> as much as I want you.</i>

55:13.743 --> 55:15.911
<i> When people are leaving</i>
<i> for summer vacation</i>

55:15.913 --> 55:17.479
<i> they put out more trash.</i>

55:17.481 --> 55:19.515
<i> Cleaning up the fridge</i>
<i> never fails.</i>

55:22.852 --> 55:24.920
<i> Ah, the tell-tale signs.</i>

55:25.822 --> 55:27.790
<i> There's always ice cream.</i>

55:31.062 --> 55:32.961
<i> Every two weeks,</i>
<i> residents here</i>

55:32.963 --> 55:34.563
<i> put out the good stuff.</i>

55:34.565 --> 55:36.865
<i> Whatever</i>
<i> isn't strictly garbage.</i>

55:36.867 --> 55:39.535
<i> By 2:00 A.M.,</i>
<i> anything usable is gone.</i>

56:00.724 --> 56:00.723
<i> Gleaners.</i>

56:00.725 --> 56:04.393
<i> Russians from the south end</i>
<i> of town.</i>

56:05.528 --> 56:06.929
<i> Bottom feeders.</i>

56:20.710 --> 56:22.644
I'm not being a baby.
I'm just not going up there.

56:22.646 --> 56:23.879
- Yes, you are.
- Duh.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.447
I'm saying you have to.

56:25.449 --> 56:27.149
Well, you know what,
i don't have to listen to you.

56:27.151 --> 56:28.550
Yes, you do.

56:31.788 --> 56:32.955
No, come on.

56:32.957 --> 56:35.391
Mommy said you have to.
I need your help.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.826
No way, there's spiders up
there. Can you just --

56:37.828 --> 56:40.028
- I don't have on shoes.
- Neither do I.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.799
I'm gonna get splinters.

56:43.801 --> 56:44.933
And I won't?

56:44.935 --> 56:46.101
<i> Do you see..</i>

56:48.605 --> 56:50.873
- Okay, we'll both go.
- Okay.

57:24.073 --> 57:25.073
No!

57:29.746 --> 57:32.047
<i> I blame myself</i>
<i> for getting lulled</i>

57:32.049 --> 57:34.116
<i> into the domestic routine.</i>

57:34.118 --> 57:37.052
<i> Day after day,</i>
<i> so much is the same.</i>

57:37.987 --> 57:40.622
<i> Diana, neighbors..</i>

57:42.091 --> 57:43.592
<i> ...tradesmen.</i>

57:46.931 --> 57:49.031
<i> Week after week.</i>

57:53.203 --> 57:56.905
<i> And one day,</i>
<i> routine goes to hell.</i>

58:14.224 --> 58:15.991
<i> Exhibit a.</i>

58:18.094 --> 58:20.062
<i> Diana couldn't be</i>
<i> taking the girls</i>

58:20.064 --> 58:22.931
<i> on our usual summer trip</i>
<i> to the cape.</i>

58:22.933 --> 58:25.067
<i> How could she possibly</i>
<i> afford it this year?</i>

58:26.970 --> 58:30.172
<i> Diana had very little</i>
<i> coming in these days.</i>

58:30.174 --> 58:32.975
<i> Would she really</i>
<i> damage our savings</i>

58:32.977 --> 58:35.143
<i> just to loll around</i>
<i> on the beach</i>

58:35.145 --> 58:37.145
<i> in her very small bikini?</i>

58:39.083 --> 58:41.550
<i> God, the three of them.</i>

58:41.552 --> 58:43.852
<i> I'm trying to track</i>
<i> the exact moment</i>

58:43.854 --> 58:46.555
<i> those three became</i>
<i> the opposing team.</i>

58:46.557 --> 58:48.023
How do you do?

58:49.025 --> 58:52.194
How was, uh, how was school?

59:00.837 --> 59:02.638
Okay. Right.

59:06.042 --> 59:09.011
<i> The many times I've listened</i>
<i> under the windows</i>

59:09.013 --> 59:13.782
<i> of this house,</i>
<i> have I heard my name</i>
<i> spoken even once?</i>

59:18.054 --> 59:19.788
<i> So, why am I still concerned</i>

59:19.790 --> 59:21.790
<i> about their</i>
<i> financial situation?</i>

59:24.727 --> 59:27.195
<i> I'm the one</i>
<i> who's impoverished,</i>
<i> goddammit.</i>

59:27.197 --> 59:28.964
<i> Scrounging every meal.</i>

59:30.133 --> 59:32.200
<i> It's hot as blazes</i>
<i> in this attic.</i>

59:34.304 --> 59:36.104
<i> It's glaringly obvious</i>

59:36.106 --> 59:38.907
<i> that my wife herself</i>
<i> will come up here tonight</i>

59:38.909 --> 59:42.177
<i> to carry away those</i>
<i> essential vacation items</i>

59:42.179 --> 59:45.147
<i> that Howard Wakefield,</i>
<i> devoted husband</i>

59:45.149 --> 59:48.116
<i> had so obediently opened</i>
<i> his wallet to provide.</i>

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.049
<i> A prisoner.</i>

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:25.053
<i> That's what</i>
<i> I've made of myself.</i>

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:27.823
<i> A fuckwit prisoner</i>
<i> of all time.</i>

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.837
Here we go.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.255
Ugh.

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.759
Ah!

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.763
Oh! Ugh, ugh!

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.233
Oh!

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.346
Son of a bitch!

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.249
Oh!

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:14.463
Ah!

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.321
Look, oh, dear.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.357
It's a shame.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.440
She isn't back. She's getting
stuff into the car.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.917
How many bags? Hold up.
I got the chairs.

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.420
Sweetheart.

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.829
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.998
I brought us
a go cup of coffee.

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:59.134
<i> Is it just me</i>
<i> or is it oddly relaxing</i>

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:00.969
<i> when the wife</i>
<i> goes out of town?</i>

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.448
<i> You know, maybe it's summer</i>

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.451
<i> but I find I'm becoming lax</i>

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.453
<i> about keeping up with events.</i>

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.936
Look at you.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.276
Uh..

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.517
"Luckiest guy on wall street?"

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.220
Goddamn right he is.

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.924
Divorced.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.193
Loser.

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:09.037
<i> What's amazing is that</i>
<i> old dirk and I</i>

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:11.406
<i> ended up in the same line</i>
<i> of work.</i>

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.508
<i> Dirk morrison, junk man.</i>

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.944
<i> Scavenging</i>
<i> the remnants of what?</i>

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.679
<i> Pizza chains</i>
<i> and supermarkets?</i>

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.547
<i> Buying, raiding, flipping.</i>

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.384
<i> Exhausting.</i>

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:22.384
Mm.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:25.420
Take the money to him.
There you go.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.426
Good job, sweetheart.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.571
<i> Do I ever worry that someone</i>
<i> might recognize me</i>

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:45.707
<i> on one of these</i>
<i> expeditions to town?</i>

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.278
<i> Diana.</i>

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.180
<i> Coming home early</i>
<i> from the cape.</i>

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.586
<i> She could show up</i>
<i> any moment.</i>

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:06.261
<i> Oh, believe me,</i>
<i> I can knock out</i>
<i> countless variations.</i>

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.471
<i> It's endlessly entertaining.</i>

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.508
<i> You do realize,</i>
<i> I hope, that none of this</i>

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.210
<i> is a rejection of my wife</i>

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:25.146
<i> or -- or suburban life</i>
<i> or any of that.</i>

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.652
<i> You see, I never</i>
<i> left my family.</i>

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:33.989
<i> I left myself.</i>

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.392
<i> I stepped into the wild.</i>

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:42.230
<i> Into that primal arena,</i>
<i> a beach vacation in Cape Cod</i>

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:44.032
<i> only pretends to supply.</i>

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:50.772
<i> But in the primal world,</i>
<i> there's one law.</i>

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:52.540
Oh!

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.745
<i> We are food to one another..</i>

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.315
<i> ...or we are not.</i>

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:03.018
<i> That's it. End of story.</i>

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.627
<i> You know how in late summer</i>

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.030
<i> there's always</i>
<i> that first night of Autumn.</i>

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:17.699
<i> That familiar chill.</i>

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.538
<i> Normally, I welcome</i>
<i> the change of seasons.</i>

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.041
<i> But this time, well</i>

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:28.276
<i> I no longer</i>
<i> have a pair of shoes.</i>

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.647
No, no, no, mine. Mine, hey!

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:07.615
Hey, hey, no, no, no!

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.451
Mine. Mine!

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.222
No. No.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.497
-<i> Nyet!</i>
- Go!

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.832
<i> Nyet! Nyet!</i>

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.312
Come, come on.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.684
Mm.

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.473
Herbert.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:13.675
Herbert.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.349
Emily.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:23.818
Hm.

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:28.690
Emily and Herbert.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.532
Howard.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:38.533
Howard.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.238
<i> Howard.</i>

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:45.773
Shoes.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.382
Uh-huh.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.940
Yeah, okay.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.947
Listen.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.787
Emily, Herbert..

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:37.725
...it's very important

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.763
that you don't tell anyone
that you saw me.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.364
<i> You understand?</i>

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.834
Shh, shh, yes, yes.

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:48.936
It's a secret.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.614
Bye.

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.596
<i> Suppose they do</i>
<i> tell someone,</i>
<i> those two next door.</i>

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.368
<i> I should leave.</i>

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.973
<i> Diana will be</i>
<i> coming back soon.</i>

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:27.809
<i> My daughters</i>
<i> coming up the stairs</i>

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:29.911
<i> to put</i>
<i> their vacation gear away.</i>

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.452
<i> I should go sleep</i>
<i> in the woods.</i>

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.005
Mm.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:31.038
Those are toe shoes
for ballet.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.573
You know, ballet?

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:37.178
Mm-hm.

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:45.420
Yeah, that's you. Look here.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:47.588
You know who that is?

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.457
- Mm?
- Who is that?

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:52.794
Yeah.

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:55.062
Yes. That's Emily.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.732
- Emily?
- Emily.

01:13:57.734 --> 01:13:58.933
Yeah.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.934
Oh, you know what that is?

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.838
That is a bicycle pump.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.842
You use that to put air in
your -- in your bicycle tires.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:42.009
Here, let me -- let me
show you.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.011
You see, uh, there we go, see.

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:45.246
You take this part..

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:48.049
<i> Have I mentioned</i>
<i> the loneliness?</i>

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:49.083
Just like.. Feel the air?

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:50.651
Feel this?

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:57.525
Whoo! Hoo-hoo! I give up.
Let's get Emily. Come on.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:04.599
Oh. Now this
is a very important
piece of equipment.

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:04.599
You have a hole..

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:08.536
<i> When you are alone</i>
<i> for so long</i>

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:11.138
<i> you forget the simple</i>
<i> human exchange.</i>

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.274
Snap that into place. Voila.

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:19.080
Listen, Herbert, Emily.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.684
Don't come back here again

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.553
or I'll have to leave.

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:28.990
Okay? Do you understand?

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.794
It's our secret. Remember?

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:36.130
Yes. Yes.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.065
Good, Herbert. Our secret.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.902
Remember, Emily?
Don't tell anyone.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:45.540
And I mean it.
Don't come back.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.010
Yeah.

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:56.083
<i> They'll never be able</i>
<i> to keep their end of it.</i>

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:07.328
<i> The sensible thing would be</i>
<i> to abandon this place.</i>

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:09.764
Ah.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:14.869
<i> No question. I'd have</i>
<i> completely stranded myself.</i>

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.015
<i> She's taking</i>
<i> dance class again.</i>

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:11.952
That's good.

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.766
<i> She seems a little</i>
<i> tired tonight.</i>

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:26.801
Well..

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.971
The kids are
running her ragged.

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:42.183
<i> They're looking</i>
<i> more like Diana these days,</i>
<i> don't you think?</i>

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.458
<i> Hey, check this out.</i>

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.394
<i> I like her wearing her hair</i>
<i> long like that.</i>

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:56.363
- Have a safe drive. Bye.
- Bye.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:05.940
Uh, Taylor, gelly, I think,
um, these ninja's might
belong to you.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:07.508
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:08.976
<i> Boys.</i>

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.314
<i> When did that happen?</i>

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:16.283
What do you say when you knock
on the door on Halloween?

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:17.785
Good morning.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:18.919
Good morning?

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.188
You don't say good morning.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.124
- <i> Trick or treat!</i>
<i>- Trick or treat!</i>

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.270
<i> There's no point denying it.</i>

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.774
<i> They're much happier</i>
<i> without me.</i>

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:16.443
<i> She's buying the cheaper</i>
<i> cuts of meat.</i>

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.046
<i> Saving her pennies.</i>

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.353
<i> Suppose she has to sell</i>
<i> the house?</i>

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:33.194
<i> How far am I willing</i>
<i> to let this go?</i>

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.432
<i> Then again,</i>
<i> it could end at any moment.</i>

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.137
<i> I could be exposed.</i>

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:48.843
<i> Christ, if I did go back</i>

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:51.412
<i> I mean, how would I begin?</i>

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.382
<i> How does a man</i>
<i> in my situation</i>

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.418
<i> explain himself to his wife?</i>

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.288
<i> She'll think</i>
<i> I vacated my senses.</i>

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:08.495
<i> If anything, I've come</i>
<i> into my senses fully.</i>

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:18.973
<i> My god, I can see it</i>
<i> so clearly.</i>

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.910
<i> I've constructed</i>
<i> the whole thing.</i>

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:25.880
<i> The jealousy</i>

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:27.114
<i> the resentment..</i>

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.117
<i> ...the selfish urgency.</i>

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.127
<i> Howard is victim.</i>

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:45.199
<i> Howard is persecutor.</i>

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:46.901
<i> There's no one there,</i>
<i> Howard.</i>

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:51.272
<i> Howard has mastered</i>
<i> the world.</i>

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:58.145
<i> That was my prison.</i>

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.147
<i> That's what I've escaped.</i>

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:06.553
<i> Leaving me where now?</i>

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.226
<i> An outcast of cosmos.</i>

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:20.000
<i> I'll tell you this.</i>

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.937
<i> You can think</i>
<i> whatever you like.</i>

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:26.407
<i> I love my wife now as I've</i>
<i> never loved her before.</i>

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:44.158
<i> So I'm guessing</i>
<i> Thanksgiving dinner</i>

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.427
<i> will be at babs' house</i>
<i> this year.</i>

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:50.631
<i> And you know what</i>
<i> that means.</i>

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:53.434
<i> Zilch-o for me</i>
<i> in the leftovers department.</i>

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.043
<i> Who am I kidding?</i>

01:23:03.045 --> 01:23:04.712
<i> A family of ten</i>
<i> could eat for weeks</i>

01:23:04.714 --> 01:23:06.580
<i> off what my neighbors</i>
<i> throw out.</i>

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.485
<i> This stuff will</i>
<i> keep forever.</i>

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.588
<i> The whole attic's</i>
<i> like a goddamn refrigerator.</i>

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:25.466
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> Howard Wakefield had</i>
<i> ignored some basic repairs.</i>

01:23:46.088 --> 01:23:48.255
<i> What about</i>
<i> when it starts snowing?</i>

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:52.326
<i> Diana will think</i>
<i> she has a prowler.</i>

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.730
<i> Stupid. They're not home.</i>

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:59.199
<i> Go inside where it's warm.</i>

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.485
<i> The first catch</i>
<i> of the game..</i>

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:20.220
<i> He's going for another</i>
<i> first down.</i>

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.070
<i> And with our</i>
<i> black Friday sales</i>
<i> going on</i>

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:36.070
<i> throughout the entire weekend</i>

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:39.640
<i> you can find savings</i>
<i> for the entire family.</i>

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:43.270
Ssh. Shh, shh.

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.608
<i> Want some wine?</i>

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.279
<i> Here.</i>

01:25:52.281 --> 01:25:54.681
<i> Just a little --</i>
<i> just a little sip.</i>

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.277
<i> Here.</i>

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.720
<i> "The quality of mercy</i>
<i> is not strained.</i>

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.723
<i> "It droppeth</i>
<i> as the gentle rain</i>

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.959
<i> from heaven</i>
<i> upon the place beneath."</i>

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:43.263
<i> Your whole life</i>
<i> you hear that quoted.</i>

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.767
<i> I never got it till now.</i>

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:52.406
<i> Mercy is not something</i>
<i> you ever get to request.</i>

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:56.210
<i> Not strained</i>
<i> means not forced.</i>

01:26:57.378 --> 01:27:00.647
<i> It's given freely.</i>

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:02.683
Thank you, Herbert.
Thank you, Emily.

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.425
<i> No reason.</i>

01:27:11.427 --> 01:27:14.394
<i> Just a gift drops</i>
<i> from the sky.</i>

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:20.801
<i> Twice blessed.</i>

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:22.336
<i> Blessing him that gives</i>

01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:24.371
<i> and him that takes</i>

01:27:24.373 --> 01:27:26.740
<i> if I remember correctly.</i>

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:26.740
Thank you.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:30.444
<i> The giving and the taking</i>
<i> all in one.</i>

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:30.037
Okay.
Thank you so much, Caleb.

01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:32.406
We'll see you in June? July?
June? Okay.

01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:33.540
Okay.

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.986
<i> Supposed she had</i>
<i> recognized us.</i>

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.790
<i> You could have lost her</i>
<i> right there, pal.</i>

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.726
Unthinkable.

01:28:52.728 --> 01:28:54.561
<i> I mean, the shock of it.</i>

01:28:54.563 --> 01:28:57.597
<i> To look into Diana's eyes.</i>

01:28:57.599 --> 01:29:01.802
<i> Her eyes that I've seen into</i>
<i> countless, countless times</i>

01:29:01.804 --> 01:29:04.771
<i> to look and to see nothing.</i>

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:17.017
<i> I had no idea how one-sided</i>
<i> this relationship</i>
<i> had become.</i>

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.012
Where should I dump
daddy's clothes?

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:47.647
<i> Put everything in the car.</i>

01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:49.383
<i> Good god.</i>

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:52.085
<i> They're emptying my closet.</i>

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.593
I'll be right back.

01:29:59.595 --> 01:30:02.562
Just put the oven on,
would you, please? 350.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.564
-<i> Alright.</i>
- Close the door.

01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:15.836
<i> Am I a coward, afraid</i>
<i> of facing her rejection?</i>

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:20.207
<i> Or am I just resolved</i>
<i> to see this thing through?</i>

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:24.077
<i> And by this thing</i>

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:26.112
<i> what the hell do I even mean?</i>

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.787
<i> Gone is the provider</i>

01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:36.022
<i> the family man, the litigator</i>

01:31:36.024 --> 01:31:38.024
<i> the husband.</i>

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:40.560
<i> All that remains</i>
<i> is the lover.</i>

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:45.265
<i> Enduring, passionate.</i>

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:51.538
<i> I love her</i>
<i> because she belongs to me.</i>

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.573
<i> And I love her</i>
<i> because she doesn't.</i>

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:59.145
<i> And I know</i>
<i> if I come in from exile</i>

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:00.847
<i> there's every chance</i>
<i> I'll lose her.</i>

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:04.017
<i> On the other hand</i>

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:06.019
<i> I know this look she has</i>

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:07.754
<i> from deep memory.</i>

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:13.226
<i> My wife, infatuated..</i>

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.795
<i> ...eager to please..</i>

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:20.901
<i> ...trusting that every word</i>
<i> is true.</i>

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:40.086
<i> Why wouldn't she seek</i>
<i> a little tenderness?</i>

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.765
<i> I'm not saying</i>
<i> I welcome this.</i>

01:32:51.767 --> 01:32:53.767
<i> I'm saying I understand.</i>

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.787
<i> Mom, can you get scissors?</i>

01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:14.955
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hang on.

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:19.059
Just leave the tree
by the steps, okay?

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:20.627
Okay.

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.106
<i> Company for dinner?</i>

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.076
<i> Who can it be?</i>

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.814
Um..

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:36.870
<i> Ah! A-ha!</i>

01:34:36.872 --> 01:34:38.838
<i> A city feller, eh?</i>

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:50.283
<i> He's tall.</i>

01:34:50.285 --> 01:34:52.786
<i> Not much to conclude</i>
<i> from that.</i>

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:58.291
<i> My, my.</i>

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:01.928
<i> Coffee and dessert</i>
<i> in the living room.</i>

01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:03.963
<i> This is a special evening.</i>

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:30.457
Oh, my god.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.494
<i> Dirk morrison.</i>

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:37.297
Son of bitch.

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:40.333
<i> Then again,</i>
<i> who else would it be?</i>

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:47.240
<i> The unfinished business.</i>

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:54.314
<i> They've compared stories</i>

01:35:54.316 --> 01:35:55.882
<i> revived the past.</i>

01:35:55.884 --> 01:35:56.950
<i> Jesus.</i>

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.221
<i> He's told her</i>
<i> everything by now.</i>

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:07.794
<i> At last, the great fraud</i>
<i> has been exposed.</i>

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:37.323
<i> You do understand</i>
<i> that this was the music</i>
<i> of our courtship.</i>

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:47.267
<i> If he's the one</i>
<i> you think you want, my love..</i>

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:52.105
<i> ...it seems only fair</i>
<i> to give you the choice</i>
<i> this time.</i>

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:59.212
<i> Forgive me</i>
<i> if I don't stand and watch..</i>

01:36:59.214 --> 01:37:02.048
<i> ...as another man lays claim</i>
<i> to your affections.</i>

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:38.618
What happened to the burberry
coat that -- that was here?

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.254
It was sold yesterday.

01:37:41.256 --> 01:37:42.488
Sorry.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:00.874
- There.
- Thank you.

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.671
<i> It seems remarkable</i>
<i> that I still know</i>
<i> how to drive.</i>

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:51.351
<i> Strange to be subject</i>
<i> to rules again.</i>

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:13.740
<i> You forget god awfulness.</i>

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:18.578
<i> Buildings stacked up</i>
<i> like that.</i>

01:40:22.049 --> 01:40:24.584
<i> People in endless</i>
<i> replication.</i>

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:33.259
<i> It's impossible to imagine</i>
<i> I worked here once.</i>

01:40:33.261 --> 01:40:35.261
<i> That I could</i>
<i> ever work here again.</i>

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:39.232
<i> One thing at a time, Howard.</i>

01:40:39.234 --> 01:40:41.067
<i> Construct it.</i>

01:40:41.069 --> 01:40:43.803
<i> First the thrift store,</i>
<i> then the haircut.</i>

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.575
<i> And now I can pass</i>
<i> through this door.</i>

01:40:57.684 --> 01:41:00.586
<i> First that and now this.</i>

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.791
Karaoke.

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.340
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.959
I'm home.
