You're about to close

to sell any ads

05:02.308 --> 05:03.808
I mean, I love my Tesla.

05:03.891 --> 05:04.975
It has Insane Mode,

05:05.058 --> 05:08.641
which means it goes
zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds,

05:08.724 --> 05:10.392
which is literally insane.

05:10.474 --> 05:14.058
But the Tesla
that Danny ordered
has Ludicrous Mode,

05:14.142 --> 05:17.599
which means it goes
zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds.

05:17.683 --> 05:22.766
So it's gonna take me
an entire 0.4 seconds
longer to get to 60.

the biggest one
they made, so.

You're the biggest
tiki head guy
in the neighborhood.

05:35.933 --> 05:38.183
I used to be
the Tesla guy
in the office.

05:38.267 --> 05:41.183
I maxed out my credit cards
to be able to afford that thing.

we're getting series B,

05:42.599 --> 05:45.808
any one of these bourgeois
new money millennial fucks

05:45.891 --> 05:47.474

only I made money.
You know?

05:54.058 --> 05:55.100
What are we
talking about, here?

05:55.183 --> 05:57.558
You want us to launch
a cryptocurrency?

05:57.641 --> 05:58.808
I do.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.891
The fact that people are willing
to pay many multiples more

06:00.975 --> 06:02.891

than they're worth,

06:02.975 --> 06:04.891
we have an opportunity here.

06:04.975 --> 06:06.350
Worth is relative, Richard.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.558
What do you mean?

06:07.641 --> 06:09.392
Why do people covet

06:09.474 --> 06:13.016
the silly pieces
of green cotton paper
in their wallets?

06:13.100 --> 06:15.724
It's because
we are all sheep.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.724
And we've mutually agreed
to endow certain things

06:18.808 --> 06:20.058
with value.

06:20.142 --> 06:22.516
And right now,
for some reason,

06:22.599 --> 06:25.975
the market values our
credits more than we did.

06:26.058 --> 06:27.891
Gilfoyle, we're not
gonna suddenly pivot

06:27.975 --> 06:29.724
and become a digital
currency company.

06:29.808 --> 06:30.891
I'm not proposing a pivot.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.350
I'm proposing that
we sell digital currency

06:33.433 --> 06:36.433

You really expect me

06:55.392 --> 06:59.599
There are very few things
that I will defend
with true passion:

06:59.683 --> 07:01.183
medical marijuana,

07:01.267 --> 07:05.808
the biblical Satan as a metaphor
for rebellion against tyranny,

07:05.891 --> 07:08.933
and mother fucking
Goddamn cryptocurrency.

07:09.016 --> 07:10.558
Mmm.

07:10.641 --> 07:14.350

07:16.516 --> 07:18.433
We can't make
our boxes in China

07:18.516 --> 07:19.599

07:19.683 --> 07:21.308
every manufacturer
in the country.

07:21.392 --> 07:22.350
That's right.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.641
We can't afford Bangladesh,

07:23.724 --> 07:25.392
because the workers
have unionized.

07:25.474 --> 07:27.308
Sadly, correct.

07:27.392 --> 07:28.975
And we can't use
our place in Laos,

07:29.058 --> 07:31.766
because one person
gets her scalp ripped off

07:31.850 --> 07:34.641
and suddenly, everyone's
screaming regulations.

07:34.724 --> 07:35.599
Yes.

07:35.683 --> 07:37.058
You know, you hear
a lot of chatter

07:37.142 --> 07:38.975
about the growth
of the global economy,

07:39.058 --> 07:40.891
but no one wants to
talk about the downside.

07:40.975 --> 07:44.975
Gavin, there is one other
manufacturing option
we haven't discussed yet,

07:45.058 --> 07:47.433
which considering
the current circumstances,

07:47.516 --> 07:49.392
might be worth consideration.

07:49.474 --> 07:51.850
I'm open to anything.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.016
America.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.516
Fuck you.

07:55.599 --> 07:57.267
I feel the same way.

07:57.350 --> 07:58.850
But we were recently contacted

07:58.933 --> 08:01.100
by the mayor of
Goldbriar, North Carolina.

08:01.183 --> 08:03.516
They had a DVR
manufacturing plant
that closed.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.308
The retooling would be minimal.

08:05.392 --> 08:06.683
Scott:
They've got
a skilled labor pool

08:06.766 --> 08:09.350
just sitting idle
and they sound desperate.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.142
Really?

08:11.225 --> 08:12.183
How desperate?

08:12.267 --> 08:13.474
It was pitiful.

08:13.558 --> 08:14.766
Really?

08:15.766 --> 08:18.850
In 350 BCE,

08:18.933 --> 08:22.392
Aristotle defined
sound money as being

08:22.474 --> 08:23.891
durable, transferable,

08:23.975 --> 08:26.308
divisible, scarce,
recognizable....

08:26.392 --> 08:28.016
Gilfoyle?
and fungible.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.016
What?

08:29.100 --> 08:31.350
Can we skip ahead 2,400 years?

08:31.433 --> 08:34.016
I mean, I know
what cryptocurrency is.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.766
Richard, a lot of work
went into this presentation.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.599
Okay.
Fine.

08:40.267 --> 08:43.183
But you're missing out
on a lot of wisdom, here.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.392
Why don't you tell me
what you know

08:47.474 --> 08:49.891
about Bitcoin
as a jumping

08:49.975 --> 08:51.392
Okay, sure.

08:51.474 --> 08:54.808
Uh, well, I'm pretty sure
it was founded by
a Japanese guy...

08:54.891 --> 08:56.433
Or guys, or girls,

08:56.516 --> 08:59.850
going by the name
Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

08:59.933 --> 09:01.225
True identity still unknown.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.724
Okay, look, every day
I read an article

09:03.808 --> 09:06.058
about how we're in
a Bitcoin bubble.

09:06.142 --> 09:08.392
And who is writing
those articles?

09:08.474 --> 09:10.183
I don't wanna say
the establishment.

09:10.267 --> 09:12.558
But is it possible that
Warren Buffett

09:12.641 --> 09:15.142
called Bitcoin
a pyramid scheme

09:15.225 --> 09:18.975
because he has 92 billion
conventional dollars to protect?

09:19.058 --> 09:22.308
Let's say he's right.
Let's say Bitcoin dies.

09:22.392 --> 09:25.433
So what?
MySpace, Friendster,
they both died.

09:25.516 --> 09:28.183
But they paved the way
for other social media tripe

09:28.267 --> 09:30.016
like Facebook and Twitter

09:30.100 --> 09:32.558
to completely
overrun the planet.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.975
Crypto is out there.

09:36.058 --> 09:37.641
And it's not going away.

09:37.724 --> 09:39.933
It just feels sketchy.

09:40.016 --> 09:44.724
In the same way that
a new Internet
is sketchy, Richard?

09:44.808 --> 09:46.808
Well--
What is crypto?

09:46.891 --> 09:49.933
If not decentralized,
anonymous, secure,

09:50.016 --> 09:53.142
and an existential threat
to the powers that be?

09:53.225 --> 09:55.433
I would think that you'd be
all-in on something like that.

09:55.516 --> 09:59.016
Yeah. But do you really think
we can create a currency

09:59.100 --> 10:00.516
worth $30 million?

10:00.599 --> 10:02.100
Because that's what
we'd be giving up.

10:02.183 --> 10:04.933
Maybe. Probably even more.

10:05.016 --> 10:06.558
But even if it's less,

10:07.474 --> 10:10.641
we would still gain
control, autonomy,

10:10.724 --> 10:11.891
board seats and shares,

10:11.975 --> 10:15.975
and you wouldn't have to rely
on a VC who once fired you

10:16.058 --> 10:17.724
from your own company.

10:20.016 --> 10:21.225
So, there is a mode

10:21.308 --> 10:23.683
above Ludicrous Mode.
Am I correct?

10:23.766 --> 10:25.724
Yes. It's called Plaid.

10:25.808 --> 10:28.392
And it comes standard
on the new Tesla Roadster.

10:28.474 --> 10:29.766
How do I get
into one of these babies?

10:29.850 --> 10:33.433
Simple. You put down
a $50,000 deposit today.

10:33.516 --> 10:34.975
Okay.

10:35.058 --> 10:36.558
And you'll be behind the wheel

10:36.641 --> 10:38.100
as soon as they
become available.

10:38.183 --> 10:40.433
And how quickly
will that be, Stephanie?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.683
Soon. We're thinking
a few years,

10:42.766 --> 10:44.350
which goes by fast.

10:44.433 --> 10:46.308
My daughter was
a teenager in high school.

10:46.392 --> 10:48.433
Next thing I knew...
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

10:48.516 --> 10:51.683
Your oily salesmanship
is starting to really
irritate me.

10:51.766 --> 10:52.850
Okay?

10:52.933 --> 10:55.350
I need to maintain
my Tesla superiority,

10:55.433 --> 10:56.683
and I need to do it now.

10:56.766 --> 10:59.058
Okay, I'm looking at
a new set of wheels here.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.683
The 21-inch Arachnids.

11:00.766 --> 11:03.724
Very nice.
But they're not for sale.

11:03.808 --> 11:06.350
You can only get them
through our referral
awards program.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.183
You refer three
other customers to us,

11:08.267 --> 11:12.016
they buy a vehicle
and, zoop-zoop,
you get the wheels.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.933
So, if I get more
people to buy Teslas,

11:15.016 --> 11:18.641
then I will have the wheels
and no one else can get them?

11:18.724 --> 11:19.683
Not even Danny?

11:19.766 --> 11:21.516
I'm sorry, who's Danny?

11:21.599 --> 11:23.516
He's the guy
with the shitty wheels.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.850
Major Wilkins:
And now, the CEO of Hooli,

11:26.933 --> 11:28.558
Mr. Gavin Belson.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.933
Thank you, Mayor Wilkins.

11:35.016 --> 11:38.308
Thank you, Goldbriar, for this
warm, wonderful welcome.

11:38.392 --> 11:40.183
You know, being
in North Carolina

11:40.267 --> 11:43.058
always feels like a bit
of a homecoming for me.

11:43.142 --> 11:47.350
I own a vacation property
just off the coast in Bermuda.

11:47.433 --> 11:50.016
Technically, it is
my primary legal residence.

11:52.683 --> 11:54.392
Good people of Goldbriar,

11:54.474 --> 11:56.724
for too long, foreign interests

11:56.808 --> 11:59.641
have used unfair trade
and labor practices

11:59.724 --> 12:02.975
to plunder American wealth
and steal American jobs.

12:03.058 --> 12:04.392
But I don't
blame them for that.

12:04.474 --> 12:09.433
No. I blame weak, spineless
American politicians.

12:09.516 --> 12:11.558
But if your mayor
does his job,

12:11.641 --> 12:12.850
your jobs will come back,

12:12.933 --> 12:15.558
and soon, you will
proudly be building

12:15.641 --> 12:18.933
the Gavin Belson
Signature Box Three.

12:19.016 --> 12:21.058
But if for some reason

12:21.142 --> 12:25.016
he can't make my
very reasonable proposal work,

12:25.100 --> 12:26.350
you know who to blame.

12:27.308 --> 12:29.474
I'm excited to get started.

12:29.558 --> 12:31.641
What about y'all?

12:37.350 --> 12:40.850
♪ ♪

12:47.350 --> 12:49.516
♪ ♪

12:52.933 --> 12:54.683
Jared: Hi, Holden.
Oh.

12:56.766 --> 12:59.350
Jared. Hi.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.516
Hi.

13:01.516 --> 13:02.808
Can I ask you a question?

13:02.891 --> 13:04.350
Of course.

13:05.308 --> 13:07.308
Did you ask Richard to tell me

13:07.392 --> 13:10.850
that he liked the sandwich
that you made for him?

13:11.933 --> 13:13.016
No.

13:17.599 --> 13:18.724
Is that the truth?

13:19.724 --> 13:20.766
Yes.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.058
Okay.

13:27.891 --> 13:28.891
Okay.

13:31.308 --> 13:32.724
Good job with that plate.

13:34.392 --> 13:35.433
Thanks.

13:45.599 --> 13:48.100
Dinesh:
Now, I can see
the looks on your faces.

13:48.183 --> 13:49.683
I know what you're thinking.

13:49.766 --> 13:53.183
Why does Dinesh care
so much if I buy a Tesla?

13:53.267 --> 13:54.724
I'll tell you why.

13:54.808 --> 13:57.433
Because Teslas
are good for the world.

13:57.516 --> 14:00.016
Surprisingly pedestrian wheels,
but you get over that.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.683
So, come on.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.683
Series B, right? Cha-ching.

14:03.766 --> 14:05.975
I was gonna use that
to pay off my student loans.

14:06.058 --> 14:06.975
That's boring.

14:07.058 --> 14:08.558
And don't take this
the wrong way,

14:08.641 --> 14:10.724
but it seems like
it's very important

14:10.808 --> 14:13.433
for you to be
the Tesla guy in the office.

14:13.516 --> 14:14.850
Like, weirdly important.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.766
I'm not weird, you're weird.
You guys are being so weird.

14:17.850 --> 14:21.183
Come on. What's it gonna take
to get you into a Tesla today?

14:21.267 --> 14:24.516
Here. I've printed out
hundreds of these.

14:24.599 --> 14:26.891
There you go.
There you go,
pass these on.

14:26.975 --> 14:28.308
Dave

14:29.599 --> 14:31.975
All right, what's this
interesting idea?

14:32.058 --> 14:33.599
Gilfoyle and I were talking.

14:33.683 --> 14:37.641
And this may seem a little
out there at first, but...

14:37.724 --> 14:41.683
Instead of funding
our launch with a series B,

14:41.766 --> 14:42.933
what about...

14:43.933 --> 14:44.933
an ICO?

14:46.808 --> 14:49.308
An initial coin offering?
It's basically a...

14:49.392 --> 14:51.267
Are you a fucking moron?

14:52.975 --> 14:55.058
Maybe I don't need
to be here for this.

14:55.142 --> 14:56.433
Sit the fuck down.

14:56.516 --> 14:57.641
Okay.

14:58.558 --> 15:00.599
Richard, what are you doing?

15:00.683 --> 15:02.516
Just exploring our options.

15:02.599 --> 15:04.766
Why? You don't think
I have your back?

15:04.850 --> 15:06.641
Look, I get that
you're giving up

15:06.724 --> 15:07.850
board seats and shares,

15:07.933 --> 15:09.766
but look what
you're getting in return.

15:09.850 --> 15:12.933
As if the $30 million
you were getting
wasn't good enough,

15:13.016 --> 15:15.433
we provide you
with marketing,
networking, staffing.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.392
We help you
negotiate partnerships

15:17.474 --> 15:18.599
and navigate regulations.

15:18.683 --> 15:21.558
All these things that are
changing by the minute.

15:21.641 --> 15:24.516
Gilfoyle, can you help
with any of that?

15:24.599 --> 15:27.350
I'd rather just listen
if it's all the same to you.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.599
Look, if you do an ICO,

15:29.683 --> 15:31.142
you're not only
saying fuck you to us,

15:31.225 --> 15:32.599
you're saying
fuck you to all VCs.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.016
Jesus, Richard.
Why would you even

15:34.100 --> 15:36.474
think it would be okay
to talk to me about this?

15:36.558 --> 15:38.808
Like would you ask your wife
who you should cheat with?

15:38.891 --> 15:40.350
No.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.392
Well, maybe.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.516
I don't know, I...

15:42.599 --> 15:45.474
I guess I was just looking
for advice from a friend.

15:45.558 --> 15:47.558
Oh, are we friends, Richard?

15:47.641 --> 15:49.100
Yes, of course.
Really?

15:49.183 --> 15:50.724
Have we spoken
once in the past year

15:50.808 --> 15:52.933
about anything
other than business?

15:53.016 --> 15:54.641
Yes.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.975
Wait. No.

15:57.058 --> 15:58.641
When's my birthday?
Come on.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.558
Do I live in a house
or an apartment?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.641
Did you even know
that I was married?

16:03.724 --> 16:05.808
You are?
I was, I...

16:05.891 --> 16:07.558
had it annulled
after three months.

16:07.641 --> 16:09.683
Did he ask you
who he should cheat with?

16:12.766 --> 16:15.308
Look, you came
for advice, fine.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.766
Forget an ICO.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.058
Okay? I'm sure Gilfoyle

16:18.142 --> 16:20.474
told you that he can handle
all the technical stuff.

16:20.558 --> 16:22.516
But this is not just
a math problem.

16:22.599 --> 16:26.808
They're my direct competition.
I've done my homework on this.

16:26.891 --> 16:28.724
So before you
walk away from stability

16:28.808 --> 16:31.683
and gamble your
entire company on crypto,

16:31.766 --> 16:33.433
there's another
"friend" of yours

16:33.516 --> 16:34.599
I think you should talk to.

16:36.142 --> 16:39.183
I was such a fucking pussy
when Bitcoin broke, Richard.

16:39.267 --> 16:40.683
If I had the balls,

16:40.766 --> 16:42.808
I'd have put every penny
I had into that shit

16:42.891 --> 16:43.808
five years ago,

16:43.891 --> 16:45.225
watched it go
up, up, up, up, up

16:45.308 --> 16:47.516
and then pulled out right before
it all came crashing down again.

16:47.599 --> 16:49.433
I mean, Jesus,
why didn't I do that?

16:49.516 --> 16:51.891
Fuck me!
But then, it occurred to me--

16:51.975 --> 16:54.850
I own 36 fucking
companies, Richard.

16:54.933 --> 16:57.142
If I make them all ICO,

16:57.225 --> 16:59.766
that's 36 bites at the apple.

16:59.850 --> 17:00.891
So I did it.

17:00.975 --> 17:03.392
You... you did 36 ICOs?
Yup.

17:03.474 --> 17:05.350
Did they work?
You know, one of the things

17:05.433 --> 17:07.599
being in the three comma club
has taught me, Richard,

17:07.683 --> 17:08.891
is it's not always
about money.

17:08.975 --> 17:10.641
Sometimes, it's about wisdom.

17:10.724 --> 17:14.308
And did I lose a B?
Close to it. Fuck!

17:14.392 --> 17:17.058
But I bet I gained
two B in wisdom.

17:17.142 --> 17:18.808
So you lost it all?

17:20.142 --> 17:23.100
Ha, ha, Richard,
if I didn't love
this crazy guy so much,

17:23.183 --> 17:24.392
I'd knock his
fucking teeth out.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.267
Nah, nah,
I didn't lose it all.

17:26.350 --> 17:28.808
I mean, one of them
got shut down by the SEC.

17:28.891 --> 17:30.599
On a few, we got scammed.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.975
But some of them worked.

17:33.433 --> 17:34.433
One of them worked.

17:34.516 --> 17:37.392
One

17:37.474 --> 17:38.433
Yeah. Listen,

17:38.516 --> 17:40.891
all the coin I had
from the ICO that worked

17:40.975 --> 17:42.433
was on a USB thumb drive.

17:42.516 --> 17:43.933
And my dumb
fucking housekeeper

17:44.016 --> 17:45.433
threw out my jeans,
'cause they were ripped.

17:45.516 --> 17:46.933
Even though I paid more
for the ripped ones.

17:47.016 --> 17:48.724
And the thumb drive
was in the pocket, so.

17:48.808 --> 17:51.599
$300 million in crypto
is buried out here, somewhere.

17:51.683 --> 17:53.100
But my boys will find it.

17:53.183 --> 17:54.975
If they wanna get paid, right?

17:56.016 --> 17:57.267
And when they do,

17:57.350 --> 17:59.100
that coin could
cover all the losers.

17:59.183 --> 18:01.516
I mean, it's up 3,000%
in the last two weeks.

18:01.599 --> 18:03.766
If it keeps going
like this over the next
three, four months,

18:03.850 --> 18:05.599
we could be talking
the four comma club!

18:05.683 --> 18:07.308
That's a T, not a B, Richard.

18:07.392 --> 18:09.808
Mr. Hanneman!
Shit, you found it?

18:09.891 --> 18:13.808
Jose! Yes! No!

18:13.891 --> 18:15.392
I said a thumb drive.

18:15.474 --> 18:17.100
In the...
that's an actual thumb.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.766
That's a human...
Just fucking put that back!

18:19.850 --> 18:23.308
Again, Richard...

18:23.392 --> 18:24.641
the math is sound.

18:24.724 --> 18:28.183
♪ ♪

18:30.474 --> 18:33.016
Well, Mayor, I sure have
enjoyed our time together.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.308
Let me know
when you get this done.

18:34.392 --> 18:37.308
Uh, Mr. Belson, I'm sorry,
but this list of demands

18:37.392 --> 18:40.142
is not remotely workable
for a community of our size.

18:40.225 --> 18:42.516
A mayor's job is never easy.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.850
But you'll find a way,

18:43.933 --> 18:45.392
if you care
about your constituents.

18:45.474 --> 18:47.392
Mr. Belson, I grew up
in this town.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.808
I've lived here
my entire life.

18:48.891 --> 18:50.850
I'd do anything to...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:50.933 --> 18:52.808
Your entire life?
Mm-hmm.

18:52.891 --> 18:55.641
How old are you?
Forty-seven.

to take my car back.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.891
Well, that's something.

28:09.975 --> 28:11.641
And my two referrals
fell through.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.058
And I had to return mine.

28:13.142 --> 28:15.766
So now the only Tesla
in the office is Priyanka's

28:15.850 --> 28:17.350
and I'm paying for that.

28:17.433 --> 28:18.975
So, that's cool.

28:19.058 --> 28:21.724
Richard, adversity
is a great teacher.

28:21.808 --> 28:23.641
Just like cigarette burns.

28:31.641 --> 28:33.516
Laurie, hi.

28:33.599 --> 28:34.516
Laurie:
Monica.

28:34.599 --> 28:37.641
Congratulations on the ICO.

28:37.724 --> 28:41.891
Yeah, yeah. Not quite
the numbers we were hoping for.

28:41.975 --> 28:43.474
I'm sure
you're happy about that.

28:43.558 --> 28:45.058
On the contrary.

28:45.142 --> 28:46.683
Monica, you have certain values.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.183
And I see no reason
you should not work with
companies that share them.

28:49.267 --> 28:53.766
Similarly, I should
work with companies
that share my values.

28:53.850 --> 28:55.100
So, no hard feelings?

28:55.183 --> 28:57.933
No feelings at all, Monica.

28:58.016 --> 28:59.142
We are friends

28:59.225 --> 29:01.766
and we should
not let business
get in the way of that.

29:01.850 --> 29:04.975
Speaking of, I am
stepping into a meeting.

29:05.058 --> 29:08.058
Right, well, I'm surprised
you're taking this so well,

29:08.142 --> 29:09.433
I really appreciate it,
Laurie.

29:09.516 --> 29:10.724
Let us talk soon.

29:20.183 --> 29:21.474

RICHARD HENDRICKS: I just knew
we'd get some traction.

30:36.933 --> 30:39.724
We are gaining
almost 12,000 users an hour!

30:39.808 --> 30:41.433
-Yeah!

30:41.641 --> 30:42.724
You get a high-five and--

30:42.808 --> 30:44.183
You really did a number
on that kid.

30:44.267 --> 30:45.683
I just chipped away
everything

30:45.766 --> 30:48.308
that wasn't Richard's assistant
and this is what's left.

30:48.392 --> 30:49.267
Yeah!

30:50.933 --> 30:52.225
This breaks our users down.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.683
-BERTRAM GILFOYLE: No idea.

30:53.766 --> 30:55.350
It's the 51 percent attack.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.183
They can delete all
of our users.

30:58.975 --> 31:00.599
All of our developer apps.

31:01.474 --> 31:02.808
Crash our coin.

31:03.850 --> 31:06.808
This would be the end
of Pied Piper.

31:09.474 --> 31:10.724
HENDRICKS:
Just went for a run.

31:10.808 --> 31:13.350
I sprinted...
up the last bit there.

31:13.558 --> 31:14.641
What's goin' on?
