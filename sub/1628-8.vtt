NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.296 --> 00:05.161
Their hearts, they were ripped out.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.917
GOLD: When people fall
under a sleeping curse,

00:07.008 --> 00:09.124
the soul travels to a nethen/vorld.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.625
Wear this while you're sleeping.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.178
Once you control the journey,
the fear will stop.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.721
There was a little boy. He talked to me.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.389
He said his name was Henry.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.559
l arranged for transport with Cora.
There's an enchanted compass.

00:20.646 --> 00:24.184
If you promise to take me along,
Iâ€™ll help you obtain it before she does.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.400
What are you doing?
You're just gonna leave me here to die?

00:27.486 --> 00:29.477
Swan. Swan!

00:33.951 --> 00:34.940
(GRUNTS)

00:35.036 --> 00:37.448
CORA: My dear Captain,

00:37.538 --> 00:40.530
it seems you've been
on quite an adventure.

00:40.625 --> 00:41.990
The compass, please.

00:44.295 --> 00:48.504
Yes, that.
Well, matters grew complicated.

00:49.342 --> 00:51.424
It's eluded me for the moment.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.250
The details of the affair
are a bit of a bore.

00:53.346 --> 00:54.961
Really?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.762
Stealing my protection spell

00:56.849 --> 01:00.967
and climbing the beanstalk without me
might seem like a bore to you,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.803
but to me it's a betrayal.

01:04.815 --> 01:08.353
l was gonna bring it to you.
Our agreement remains.

01:08.486 --> 01:11.319
We are going to Storybrooke together.
I'll get it back.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.067
I don't have time for your games.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.568
I've crossed through too many worlds

01:15.660 --> 01:17.525
to be brought short
at the brink of success.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.160
Who was it who bested you?

01:22.541 --> 01:26.204
The Swan girl, Emma.
Rest assured, it won't happen again.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.703
(LAUGHS) No, it won't.

01:28.839 --> 01:32.832
You chose her.
And the consequences of that decision.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.083
Oh.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.385
Are you gonna kill me now?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.840
Go ahead, try.

01:42.061 --> 01:43.847
So brave.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.724
No, I'm not going to kill you.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.769
l have something
far more satisfying in mind.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.475
I'm going to leave you here.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.812
With your thirst
for revenge unquenched,

01:54.907 --> 01:57.569
while I complete ourjourney without you.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.865
There's no need to be rash.

02:01.956 --> 02:05.619
We can discuss this.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.285
Your pretty face buys you a lot,

02:10.881 --> 02:12.337
but not my time.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.836
It's too valuable.

02:15.553 --> 02:19.922
I can do this. I can get it back.
You need me.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.215
(LAUGHS) No, I don't.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.304
You've had your chance.
Now it's my turn to do this the right way.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.305
Ah!

02:30.651 --> 02:31.891
(GRUNTS)

03:05.227 --> 03:06.603
Rise.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.582
The boy you saw in your dream,
is that him?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.095
Yes. This is Henry.

03:40.638 --> 03:44.301
That's impossible. It was a dream.
How could you dream of my son?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.223
l have no idea.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.050
Maybe it wasn't a dream.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.760
What?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.979
That room. I've been there.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.058
When I told you about it,
you didn't say anything.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.653
You were terrified.
I didn't want to make things worse

03:56.737 --> 03:58.568
by telling you I thought it might be real.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.987
A room in a dream is real?

04:00.074 --> 04:01.814
The sleeping curse.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.827
It has to be.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.409
lwent through it,
Aurora went through it...

04:05.496 --> 04:07.908
Henry's been through it
because I wouldn't believe him.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.329
Emma.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.577
What else did you lie about?

04:10.668 --> 04:14.581
lwas... lwasn't lying.
l was protecting you.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.163
What did he say? Henry, in the dream?

04:18.843 --> 04:22.506
He just said his name.
And then I woke up and it was over.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.219
SNOW WHITE: Emma.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.672
It's gonna be okay.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.515
We are so far from okay.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.763
No, we have a way home now.

04:30.855 --> 04:31.935
We have a compass.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.933
And the wardrobe ashes
are still with Cora.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.106
Any attempt to steal from her
would be suicide.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.105
Not anymore. We can stop her.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.187
-How?
-SNOW WHITE: I don't know.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.985
But I know someone who does.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.447
Rumplestiltskin. He'll know a way.

04:48.664 --> 04:52.657
Henry. We can talk to him.
Now we can communicate.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.127
Wait, wait.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.496
Oh, yeah, Princess.
You're going back to sleep.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.007
Henry?

05:03.429 --> 05:04.794
(COUGHS)

05:04.889 --> 05:07.801
Henry? Henry?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.428
Henry!

05:11.353 --> 05:12.604
(GRUNTS)

05:14.023 --> 05:15.058
Hello?

05:17.193 --> 05:19.024
-Hello?
-Henry?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.731
(COUGHS) Henry, it is you?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.108
Yeah, who are you?

05:24.200 --> 05:26.907
My name is Aurora. I'm with your mom
and your grandmother.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.609
-Are they okay?
-Yes, they're fine.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.070
They just want to come home.
And they need your help.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.323
Okay, so what do I need to do?

05:34.668 --> 05:35.657
(GASPS)

05:35.836 --> 05:38.452
(PANTING) They're alive! They're alive!

05:38.547 --> 05:39.787
Who? Who's alive?

05:39.882 --> 05:41.873
(PANTING) My mom and Snow.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.923
I told you, kid. I told you!

05:44.011 --> 05:46.502
But was it that woman you saw?
Did she tell you this?

05:46.597 --> 05:49.088
Her name's Aurora.
She said they have a way home.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.798
But there's someone in their way.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.384
Someone they need us
to help them stop.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.936
Someone only Mr. Gold
knows how to defeat.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.308
Who?

05:59.485 --> 06:00.725
Your mother.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.989
BELLE: Did Iwin?
GOLD: You did.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.283
BELLE: Oh, okay.
GOLD: Again.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.485
BELLE: That's the third time in a row.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.410
-GOLD: Third time in a row.
-Huh!

06:15.292 --> 06:17.123
They smell delicious, Granny.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.374
They are delicious.
Didn't take any dark magic, either.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.127
-Oh, and I charge extra for the pickles.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.716
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:27.012 --> 06:28.673
I have a complicated
relationship with her.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.798
As I do with most people.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.311
They will.

06:39.358 --> 06:42.191
You know, you should try it with ketchup.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.810
Condiments are this world's
most powerful magic.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.360
Gold. We need to talk.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.448
Do we?

06:50.536 --> 06:53.573
Folks, I think I may need to close early,
everybody out.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.155
No, it's okay. We're civil.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.327
Yeah, for now.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.415
Belle, you remember the woman
who locked you up for 28 years.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.996
I should probablyjust...

07:04.091 --> 07:05.956
No, no. Please stay where you are.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.884
Whatever she has to say
won't be a secret from you.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.675
Whatever she wants, she won't get.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.674
I'm actually coming
about the one thing that might unite us.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.641
And what on Earth can that be?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.345
Cora.

07:22.192 --> 07:25.901
She's coming from our land.
I need your help to stop her.

07:26.030 --> 07:30.069
But she was dead.
You told me you saw the body.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.486
Well, apparently you taught her well.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.493
She's not. And she's on her way.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.617
And I don't think I need to remind you

07:37.708 --> 07:40.165
how most unpleasant that would be
for both of us.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.585
For you. I can handle Cora.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.122
That's not how she tells the story.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.878
I won in the end.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.588
REGINA: Maybe.

07:51.764 --> 07:54.506
But there's a big difference this time.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.726
This time you have someone
you care about.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.517
This time you have a weakness.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.851
I'm sorry. Who is this woman?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.355
Someone you will never meet.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.070
So you say she's coming.
Where is she now?

08:14.912 --> 08:16.698
With them.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.158
How close are we?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.661
Henry could already be waiting
in that nethen/vorld.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.538
No, we planned to meet back there
in two hours.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.119
You're not going to leave him waiting.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.791
-Yeah, but what if he's...
-He was fine.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.506
There. That looks like
relatively safe high ground.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.799
We'll set up camp there.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.214
Aurora, you'll settle in and find Henry.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.682
Get the information
we need from Rumplestiltskin.

08:35.766 --> 08:38.257
And we do this fast, in and out.
It's still dangerous out here.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.475
-(FABRIC RIPS)
-Is something wrong?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.313
No, just caught on something.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.774
That does not explain your arm.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.398
What about my arm?

08:50.489 --> 08:52.320
The burns you're hiding,
they're not from the sun.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.528
I brushed against some poison leaves.

08:55.619 --> 08:59.237
You said that this nethenNorld
was full of smoke and flames.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.164
Aurora, if that's where you were burned,
you should not return.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.334
I don't have much of a choice, do I?

09:05.462 --> 09:08.374
You're choosing to go in deeper and
staying under longer to find this boy.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.717
I vowed to Prince Phillip to protect you.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.588
Not to help some strangers
find a portal to another land.

09:13.679 --> 09:17.171
Mulan, I was cursed to spend eternity
in that horrible sleep,

09:17.307 --> 09:18.683
and the only reason I'm here

09:18.809 --> 09:21.767
is because you and Phillip
risked your lives to save me.

09:21.854 --> 09:26.268
Every day, since my waking, has been
a gift, so let me do something with it.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.690
It's my turn to help someone else.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.606
I'm going to go back in and find that boy.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.999
I brought your blanket,
from your bedroom back home.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.461
Thanks.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.337
So Cora, she's pretty powerful?

09:54.845 --> 09:57.177
Yes. But, uh, not as powerful as I am.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.848
(SCOFFS) Debatable.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.923
Actually, no, it's not.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.096
You sure you're okay to do this, kid?

10:08.192 --> 10:10.683
I was born to do this.

10:10.778 --> 10:14.612
I'm done reading about heroes.
I wanna be one.

10:14.698 --> 10:18.941
Well, sometimes being one is
knowing when not to run into the fire.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.034
I'll be okay.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.200
Look, whatever he faces in there

10:24.291 --> 10:27.704
will be far less dangerous
than what he will face if we fail.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.997
I can do this.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.164
(SIGHS)

10:36.720 --> 10:38.676
Get on with it. Fast.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.382
GOLD: All right, Henry.

10:44.394 --> 10:49.138
Just relax
and soon you're gonna drift off.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.313
What do I tell them?

10:50.400 --> 10:54.518
Just listen to my bedtime story
and all will be clear.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.408
Once upon a time,

11:01.495 --> 11:03.861
Snow White and Prince Charming

11:03.956 --> 11:06.447
needed to stun a very powerful magician

11:06.542 --> 11:10.751
long enough to lock him up
in a dark dungeon.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.374
That was you.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.547
They used Cinderella
to trap you with a magic quill.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.840
GOLD: Yes, indeed. A quill.

11:20.931 --> 11:24.765
And yet, it wasn't the quill itself

11:25.769 --> 11:29.261
but the ink that captured the Dark One.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.015
Harvested from
the rarest species of squid

11:33.110 --> 11:35.442
from the bottom of a bottomless ocean,

11:35.529 --> 11:39.113
impossible to find
unless you're a mermaid.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.900
Or me.
I happen to have a private supply.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.625
In myjail cell,
that is where they will find it.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.052
(WHISPERS) Hey.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.396
It will be okay. You'll see Henry again.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.144
This will work.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.147
(BRANCHES RUSTLE)

12:18.280 --> 12:19.645
What was that?

12:29.499 --> 12:30.830
(COUGHING)

12:33.295 --> 12:34.330
Henry?

12:35.130 --> 12:37.712
Henry! Oh! Can you help us?

12:37.841 --> 12:41.880
Yes! I know what you have to do
to stop Cora!

12:42.012 --> 12:43.172
You have to go to...

(FLAMES WHOOSHING)

12:44.348 --> 12:46.054

Where? We have to go where? Oh!

-Who is that?
-Did you hear me?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.821
No. Henry, say it again. I...

13:02.908 --> 13:04.489
-Ah!
-Aurora. ..

13:04.576 --> 13:06.237
Did you hear that?

13:06.370 --> 13:09.203
No! Aurora, what's going on?

13:09.331 --> 13:10.696
Aurora!

13:10.832 --> 13:12.288
Can you hear that?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.786
(SCREAMING)

13:15.712 --> 13:19.500
Aurora! Wake up!
Aurora, wake up! Wake up!

13:19.591 --> 13:20.831
No... Henry wasn't finished.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.666
The time for that is over!

13:30.936 --> 13:32.221
No!

13:39.403 --> 13:41.064
Emma, watch out!

13:44.366 --> 13:46.903
The compass! The compass!

13:53.208 --> 13:55.073
Any idea how to kill these things?

13:55.961 --> 13:57.451
None!

13:59.923 --> 14:01.038
Mulan!

14:02.592 --> 14:04.378
-Mulan?
-Where is she?

14:06.555 --> 14:08.967
Emma, we got to run for it!

14:13.228 --> 14:15.264
Come on, hurry, Aurora! Go!

-You still in one piece?
-Yeah, pretty much.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.685
Henry? Are you all right?

14:57.814 --> 14:59.725
Did you see her? Did you tell them?

14:59.816 --> 15:04.059
No, I didn't get the chance.
Something... Something happened.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.315
She... She got sucked out of there.

(GROANS)

15:07.908 --> 15:08.897
Henry?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.607

(GROANING)

15:15.874 --> 15:17.159
(GASPS)

15:18.001 --> 15:19.036
Henry.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.475
I thought you might be hungry.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.062
I hope you enjoy stew.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.396
I enjoy anything that masks
the bitter aftertaste of poison.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.024
Oh, plucky. I like that.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.031
You might as well go.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.282
Oh, I know.

15:57.374 --> 16:01.367
That's all right. You have nothing to tell.
You weren't my target.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.243
The compass. Sad you lost it?

16:03.380 --> 16:07.089
Isuppose.
But now I have something to trade for it.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.673
They'll never trade me for that.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.591
You might be more valuable
than you know.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.755
To who?

16:12.722 --> 16:16.306
Theyjust met me and they're trying to
get back to their families.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.304
Do you really think
they'll sacrifice that for a stranger?

16:21.273 --> 16:25.562
Your newfound companions?
You may not know them, but I do.

16:26.444 --> 16:30.312
Snow and her daughter
just can't help themselves.

16:30.407 --> 16:34.241
No matter the personal stakes,
they won't let an innocent die.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.121
We shall see.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.080
And what stakes
do you have in their cause, Princess?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.243
It's not as though
you'd travel back with them.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.244
Oh.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.501
What a sweet, misguided notion.

you could have a life there?

Find another prince?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.803
You've forgotten Phillip already.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.267
Phillip is in my heart
every moment of every day.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.439
If there was anything I could do
to bring him back, lwould!

17:06.526 --> 17:07.766
Is that so?

17:09.154 --> 17:12.521
What if I told you
that when a wraith consumes a soul,

17:12.616 --> 17:14.277
it merely travels to another realm.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.238
But that soul
can be brought back to this world.

and I may explain how.

I'm not as stupid as you think.
Nor are my loyalties so easily bought.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.882
You can bring me 100 meals
and make me 100 promises,

17:35.972 --> 17:37.303

What the hell was that?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.206
Cora.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.334
We have until sundown
to bring her the compass.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.004
If we don't, She'll kill Aurora.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.592
Give it to me.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.796
Hold on, Mulan.
Just give us a minute to consider...

18:18.890 --> 18:21.802
There's nothing to consider.
A compass is not worth Aurora's life.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.805
We need a plan to get back Aurora
and keep the compass.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.978
My vow to Phillip was to protect Aurora.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.228
That promise is all that is left of him,
so it shall be done.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.316
Hey! (GRUNTS)

18:32.404 --> 18:34.235
I climbed a beanstalk for this,
you go get your own!

18:34.322 --> 18:35.277
Give it to me.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.821
Mulan! Mulan.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.612
Give us a few hours, please.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.910
If we haven't defeated Cora by then,
you can have the compass.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.869
You can't hope to defeat her.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.331
We no longer have access
to the Dark One's assistance.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.831
-Yes, we do.
-How?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.207
Aurora is gone.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.331
Aurora isn't the only one
who's been under a sleeping curse.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.588
I can go back to that nethen/vorld.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.133
The door to that place is closed.
You said it yourself.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.383
There may be a way.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.174
A way for me to
go back into a deep slumber.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.679
One that can let me access it again.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.021
Another sleeping curse?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.265
No, not another curse.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.855
I don't need one,
I've been under already.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.934
I need to go into a sleep
where my natural defenses slip away,

19:14.070 --> 19:15.685
where my mind stops protecting me.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.281
How?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.238
Your sleeping powder.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.447
If I inhale it,

19:20.577 --> 19:23.444
I will fall into a deep enough sleep
that I should be able to do this.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.241
I used the last of it on the giant.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.408
Then make some more.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.415
The poppy plant is extremely rare
in this kingdom,

19:33.548 --> 19:35.584
but I know of a place that
may grow some more.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.461
It's a bit of a journey from here.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.175
Can we make it by sundown?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.678
We have to hurry.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.139
GOLD: Here. Let me take care of this.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.070
What caused this?

20:03.161 --> 20:06.369
GOLD: When you venture deeper
into the nethenNorld instead of away,

20:07.457 --> 20:08.617
there are risks.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.701
Someone woke Aurora
before her soul was ready to return.

20:12.796 --> 20:17.381
The violence of that act tore her away
and injured Henry.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.133
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.178
He's gonna need some time
to recover before he can be sent back.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.263
-Out of the question.
-Not a chance in hell.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.013

to even consider risking his life again.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.682
Careful with your tone, Charming.

20:31.815 --> 20:34.352
I understand your concern for the boy,
but I know Cora.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.976
Without our help,
Snow and Emma will soon be dead.

20:38.822 --> 20:43.316
And then a true monster
will be on her way to Storybrooke.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.658
Aurora is gone.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.487
Why do we need
to send Henry back to that fiery inferno

20:48.581 --> 20:50.742
with no one there
to receive our message?

20:50.834 --> 20:51.994
(SIGHS)

20:58.425 --> 21:00.711
Because someone will be there.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.129
Who?

21:02.220 --> 21:03.255
Snow.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.086
That's an awfully big assumption.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.012
No, no, it's not.
She was there once before.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.388
She can go back.
She can find a way, She will. I know it.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.227
And I'll be waiting.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.681
You're going to this nethen/vorld?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.606
Well, I've faced you.
How bad could it be?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.104
GOLD: It's not as simple as that.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.106
You can't get there.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.698
You haven't been
under a sleeping curse.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.318
Well, then put me under one.

21:24.409 --> 21:27.151
If we do that, there's a chance
you might never waken up.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.735
Sure, Iwill.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.406
When I see her, She'll kiss me.
And I'll be fine.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.622
Now put me under.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.917
I've spent far too much time
looking for my wife.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.206
It is time to bring her home.

(NORMAL VOICE) Wake up.
On your feet. Hurry!

21:50.935 --> 21:53.802
No! No, are you here to kill me?

21:53.897 --> 21:55.353
If I were here for that,
then waking you first

21:55.440 --> 21:56.805
might not be the best course of action.

21:56.900 --> 21:57.889
-(CLANK)
-Ah!

21:58.109 --> 21:59.485
So, what? Did Cora send you...

21:59.569 --> 22:00.934
Cora has no idea I'm here.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.561
I don't... I don't understand.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.989
Look, I know you're sleepy, but
isn't it obvious? I'm setting you free.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.943
What is this, some sort of pirate's ruse?

22:10.079 --> 22:12.570
Cora's denied me passage
to Storybrooke.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.621
And my vengeance.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.457
And now I'm gonna deny her her wishes.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.247
Starting with the compass.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.623
In pirate terms, you might say

22:19.756 --> 22:21.792
I'm firing a shot across my enemy's bow.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.758
You'd risked your life to break in here,
all so you could thwart Cora?

22:24.844 --> 22:28.428
I don't like being double crossed.
Now go.

22:31.643 --> 22:32.723
Thank you.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.678
You can thank me
by doing me one favor.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.096
What?

22:39.943 --> 22:41.433
Give Emma a message.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.144
Tell her that the deal still stands.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.441
If She provides me passage
back to her realm,

22:46.533 --> 22:51.027
I swear, Iwill help her find
that dust that opens the portal.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.735
You really want to assist us?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.993
Well, it hurts Cora and helps me.
Of course I do.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.502
Now go!

23:11.516 --> 23:14.758
Once we crest this ridge,
we'll be near the Woods of the Dead.

23:14.852 --> 23:18.310
The last poppies in this realm
have taken seed there.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.816
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.646
Hey, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You look nervous.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.070
This nethen/vorld, how bad is it?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.822
What's it like?

23:35.873 --> 23:39.536
It's like you're lost.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.412
Drifting in the dark.
No one to talk to, nothing to do.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.588
Except think of all the people
that you love

23:45.675 --> 23:46.755
and how you'll never see them again.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.418
Henry was lost in that dark, too,
because of me.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.468
What are you talking about?

23:51.556 --> 23:54.423
He tried so hard to convince me
I was the savior.

23:54.517 --> 23:57.930
Stop it. Nobody would have believed
Henry's stories.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.852
But his mother should have.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.519
Okay, you wanna play the blame game?

24:03.610 --> 24:06.852
Ifl hadn't told Cora
about Regina's true love,

24:08.031 --> 24:09.646
Cora never would have killed him.

24:09.741 --> 24:13.905
Regina wouldn't want revenge,
the curse never would have happened.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.195
We could spend all day

24:17.290 --> 24:19.201
trying to figure out
why each of us should feel guilty.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.374
But it will not help us get home.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.039
You really think
we're gonna make it back?

24:24.714 --> 24:27.581
If there's one thing your father
has taught me, it's not to give up.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.386
Now, it's time for me to go back to sleep.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.638
-lt's Regina.
-What?

24:42.106 --> 24:43.562
Regina.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.478
That's who we should blame.

24:47.737 --> 24:49.352
(LIQUID BUBBLING)

24:54.869 --> 24:56.530
It smells funny.

24:57.538 --> 25:01.201
(CHUCKLES) I know, sweetheart.
It's a curse.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.580
It's not meant to be pleasant.

25:06.005 --> 25:06.994
(CRUNCHES)

25:08.257 --> 25:10.248
So the potion's finished?

25:10.760 --> 25:13.843
Mr. Gold had everything
you needed in his Shop?

25:14.514 --> 25:15.594
Yes.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.265
We're almost ready.

25:23.648 --> 25:26.765
So, this is how you do it? Magic?

25:27.610 --> 25:29.646
Well, there are many ways.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.610
It's never easy.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.536
And have you been using magic?

25:40.540 --> 25:43.452
Henry, I told you lwouldn't.
And I haven't.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.201
Except for

25:48.297 --> 25:51.789
with Daniel and now.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.878
I've really been trying.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.338
It's okay.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.973
At least you're using it
to help people now.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.385
(CHUCKLES)

26:03.479 --> 26:04.810
I'm trying.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.433
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

26:07.817 --> 26:10.229
And after this, I won't.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.484
I know.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.829
(HISSING)

26:29.172 --> 26:30.912
Will David be okay?

26:32.175 --> 26:33.506
He'll be

26:35.094 --> 26:36.254
asleep.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.506
And in there, he won't die.

26:41.017 --> 26:44.009
Gold's explaining everything
to him right now.

26:52.737 --> 26:53.772
Yep.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.021
It should be me.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.863
I can go in there without a curse
and still come back.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.741
Henry, David and I
have many differences,

27:05.792 --> 27:08.124
but on this, we agree.

27:08.211 --> 27:11.874
We won't let you risk your safety.
It's just not worth it.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.579
It is to me.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.254
He won't wake up.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.302
Unless he succeeds.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.637
And if there's one thing I know
about your grandparents,

27:27.563 --> 27:30.054
they always find each other.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.897
It's beautiful.

27:39.992 --> 27:44.406
I'll use my dagger to crush the seeds.
We're doing this the old-fashioned way.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.666
DAVID: What do you mean,
the "old-fashioned way"?

27:48.584 --> 27:52.247
You're about to join
a quite distinguished club, Mr. Nolan.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.997
Before such innovations as the apple,

27:56.092 --> 27:57.923
back when the sleeping curse
first came to be,

27:58.511 --> 28:01.298
a more direct method was required.
Through blood.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.179
By pricking one's finger
on the needle of a Spinning wheel,

28:07.270 --> 28:08.976
one falls under the Spell.

28:09.105 --> 28:13.098
Your Majesty, you did his wife,
I'm sure you'd like the honors?

28:23.202 --> 28:24.612
(SIZZLING)

28:36.549 --> 28:38.210
It's all yours.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.639
Good luck.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.636
It's gonna be all right.

28:52.315 --> 28:53.395
How do you know?

28:55.067 --> 28:58.651
Well, how did you know
Emma would save you

28:58.738 --> 29:00.194
after you ate the turnover?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.321
I believed in her.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.024
The way Snow and I believed
she'd come back to break the curse.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.533
That's the kind of faith
that runs in our family.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.833
This helps control
the flames in the room.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.335
It'll keep you safe.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.048
I will guard it with my life.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.636
The powder's nearly ready.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.433
How long will the effects last?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.101
It's difficult to say.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.180
Maybe an hour. Or much less.

29:36.442 --> 29:40.185
Well, I Shouldn't need much time.
So long as Henry is in there when I am.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.689
I'll be right here.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.607
Say hi to my son for me.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.048
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

30:06.555 --> 30:08.216
(WHEEL SPINNING)

30:12.228 --> 30:14.310
When I awake, I'll be in that fiery room?

30:14.397 --> 30:15.557
Not exactly.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.726
That room is where those

30:17.817 --> 30:20.274
who have already awoken
from the curse return.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.894
You, however,
are being put under for the first time.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.028
Then how will I know where to go?

30:25.116 --> 30:27.402
How the hell am I supposed
to find a room with no door?

30:27.493 --> 30:31.827
And that, dearie, is the conundrum
we're all depending on you solving.

30:31.914 --> 30:35.498
Now, I say this with the utmost sincerity,
good luck.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.740
(SCOFFS)

30:43.759 --> 30:44.714
Ah!

30:44.802 --> 30:45.791
(INHALES SHARPLY)

30:58.107 --> 31:00.314
(INDISTINCT GHOSTLY WHISPERING)

31:02.695 --> 31:04.651
(VOICE ECHOES IN DISTANCE)

31:10.536 --> 31:11.776
(WHOOSH)

31:29.388 --> 31:31.379
Snow!

31:42.151 --> 31:43.357
Henry?

31:46.197 --> 31:47.482
Henry?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.410
Henry?

31:57.083 --> 32:00.166
Henry! Where are you?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.125
-(SIZZLES)
-Ah!

32:49.218 --> 32:51.049
(INHALES SHARPLY) Ah!

32:56.392 --> 32:57.381
The room...

33:01.397 --> 33:02.728
(CRACKING)

33:43.272 --> 33:44.603
SNOW WHITE: Charming?

33:45.649 --> 33:46.934
Charming?

33:49.904 --> 33:51.110
(GRUNTS)

33:52.948 --> 33:54.028
I don't understand.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.071
Henry should be here.

33:59.163 --> 34:03.156
I wouldn't let him come back.
This is... This is too dangerous.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.496
You found me.

34:06.629 --> 34:07.960
You found me.

34:09.298 --> 34:10.788
I knew you'd be here.

34:12.843 --> 34:14.128
I don't know how much time we have.

34:15.638 --> 34:18.254
Gold. He says there's a way
to stop Cora.

34:18.349 --> 34:20.431
We have to stun her.
Like we did with him.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.552
The quill.

34:21.644 --> 34:23.134
It wasn't the quill, it was the ink.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.720
There's a jar of it in his cell,
where we kept him.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.977
Get it. Get it, stop her, and come home.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.479
Charming, how are you here?

34:37.159 --> 34:39.525
There's no way for you
to be here, unless...

34:42.873 --> 34:44.079
I had to see you.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.702
You're in a sleeping curse.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.338
It was worth it.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.087
But now you're cursed.

34:56.178 --> 34:59.341
A curse you're gonna break
with true Iove's kiss.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.508
-(GRUNTS)
-Ah!

35:06.355 --> 35:07.390
Now.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.019
No.

35:17.199 --> 35:20.191
It's a nethen/vorld. We're not really here.

35:25.082 --> 35:26.117
I'm waking up.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.284
It's okay. You'll get back.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.540
And then you'll wake me as I woke you.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.253
You will always find me
and I will always find you.

35:36.385 --> 35:40.424
Yes. Will we always
lose each other, too? Is that our fate?

35:40.556 --> 35:43.798
No. I refuse to believe that.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.894
You need to have faith. In us.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.065
(VOICE BREAKING) I'm waking up.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.939
It's okay. You can do this.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.774
Charming.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.902
I love you.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.234
I love...

36:17.051 --> 36:19.758
Come on. Come back.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.134
Should he be in there so long?

36:24.224 --> 36:28.718
I'm sure it's fine.
I imagine they're just catching up.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.275
Hey.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.573
Hey, you okay?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.207
What... What happened?
What are you doing?

36:52.294 --> 36:53.329
I'm looking for more powder.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.706
Wait, I'm pretty sure we're out of that.
What happened?

36:55.798 --> 36:57.584
No, I have to go back in. He's all alone.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.665
Henry? IS he okay?

36:59.760 --> 37:00.795
No, it's David.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.343
He went under a sleeping spell
so he could see me.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.510
He thought that my kiss would wake him,

37:04.598 --> 37:05.804
but it didn't and now he's trapped.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.758
Okay, slow down.
David is trapped in there?

37:09.686 --> 37:13.019
I have to get back.
There's only one way to help him.

37:13.107 --> 37:14.096
True Iove's kiss?

37:14.191 --> 37:18.525
Yes, but it won't work in there.
We have to get back. If we don't...

37:18.612 --> 37:20.648
We Will. We Will.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.193
Now you're so sure?

37:24.284 --> 37:27.572
Yes, you told me to have faith

37:27.663 --> 37:29.619
and now I'm telling you,
we will make it back.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.240
Okay?

37:33.043 --> 37:35.750
Did you get the information?

37:35.838 --> 37:37.703
It's Rumplestiltskin.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.754
He said the key to stopping her
is in his jail cell.

37:39.842 --> 37:42.083
Okay, then let's go get it.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.759
Come on, get your stuff. Come on.

37:54.231 --> 37:55.846
-No.
-What?

37:56.942 --> 38:00.855
The compass is gone. And so is Mulan.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.417
HOOK: Looking for someone?

38:23.969 --> 38:24.958
Oh.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.386
Oh, don't tell me you were dumb
enough to let her go.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.886
She was never gonna give you
what you wanted anyway.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.682
So you freed her, and stuck around
for the petty satisfaction

38:35.772 --> 38:37.763
of seeing me suffer?

38:38.233 --> 38:40.815
Oh, watching you suffer
is a tempting motivation,

38:40.903 --> 38:41.983
but it wasn't that.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.935
Well, then you must have a death wish.

39:04.218 --> 39:05.799
You know I have to kill you.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.842
You should try thanking me.

39:07.930 --> 39:11.138
Oh, really? Why is that?

39:11.225 --> 39:15.184
Because I've brought you a gift.
It's in the satchel.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.188
What is it?

39:21.276 --> 39:26.191
Customarily, surprise is part of the fun
of gift giving. Open it.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.034
Is that...

39:37.125 --> 39:38.740
Indeed it is.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.622
And with it
you'll get everything you want.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.426
(PANTING)

39:49.513 --> 39:51.174
That was a warning Shot.

39:51.265 --> 39:53.096
Try to run and I promise,
the next one won't be.

39:53.684 --> 39:54.719
How did you find me?

39:54.810 --> 39:56.892
I know a thing or two about tracking.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.310
All we want is the compass.

39:59.815 --> 40:00.850
Very well.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.101
Give me the compass.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.276
And seal Aurora's fate?

40:07.364 --> 40:09.104
We learned how to overpower Cora.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.735
Once we get what we need,

40:10.826 --> 40:14.068
we will defeat her
and Aurora will be free!

40:14.162 --> 40:16.574
Anotherjourney.
Just as I predicted there would be.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.950
Our best chance to save Aurora
is to make that trade now.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.079
Not gonna happen.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.377
Without that compass,
we can't get home.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.000
Then I hope you're prepared
to use that arrow.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.803
-AURORA: Stop!
-(EXHALES)

40:35.601 --> 40:38.183
Okay, don't take this the wrong way,
but how the hell did you get here?

40:38.270 --> 40:39.760
Let Mulan go.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.521
I said, let her go.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.228
Were you followed?

40:45.694 --> 40:46.900
I don't think so.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.818
Cora may know I'm gone,
but she didn't see me escape.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.237
How did you escape?

40:51.325 --> 40:53.441
It was Hook. He let me go.

40:53.535 --> 40:54.695
VVhy?

40:55.621 --> 40:56.701
Because of you.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.369
He said he wanted to prove to you
that you should have trusted him.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.575
That if you had trusted him...

41:02.711 --> 41:05.248
AURORA AND CORA: ...you could
have defeated Cora together.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.211
That the two of you
could've gotten the remains...

41:07.299 --> 41:08.334
...of the wardrobe.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.089
Without him, you'll have to go
up against her all by yourself.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.801
CORA AND AURORA: He only wants
to help, I...

41:16.892 --> 41:19.349
I think he may care for you.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.135
(SCOFFS)

41:22.230 --> 41:23.970
Nice touch, that.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.773
But you know she won't trust you.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.896
Well, she doesn't have to.

41:29.529 --> 41:33.113
All I need is for her to believe that
I was genuine in letting the girl go,

41:33.200 --> 41:34.736
which I'd wager she does now.

41:37.287 --> 41:38.322
You're welcome.

41:39.456 --> 41:42.539
Impressive. You took her heart.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.537
And now you have a princess.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.584
Indeed,|do.

41:47.547 --> 41:50.380
Now can we get on with the business
of going to Storybrooke?

41:50.467 --> 41:51.502
Together?

41:52.135 --> 41:53.250
Why not?

41:53.929 --> 41:57.922
I hate to travel alone.
All we need is the compass.

41:59.434 --> 42:02.096
Which will soon be delivered.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.888
Did you find a way to stop Cora?

42:06.983 --> 42:08.189
Yes.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.229
Where are we going?

42:10.320 --> 42:11.856
Rumplestiltskin's cell.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.438
Great. Then lead the way.
