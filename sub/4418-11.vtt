I KNOW.

00:41.844 --> 00:44.545
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
ON A CRUISE OR SOMETHING.

00:44.547 --> 00:45.579
I CAN'T AFFORD
A CRUISE, DUDE.

00:45.581 --> 00:48.782
I KNOW, BUT WE CAN MAKE
A LITTLE BOAT OUT OF CARDBOARD

00:48.784 --> 00:50.984

00:50.986 --> 00:53.921

00:57.193 --> 01:00.561
THAT IS
SO LAME!

01:00.563 --> 01:03.096
( laughing )

01:06.836 --> 01:08.602
AND THEN WE COULD DRESS UP
IN LITTLE COSTUMES

WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

01:10.506 --> 01:13.240

01:15.244 --> 01:17.311
( Cartman )
STOP THIS!

01:17.473 --> 01:20.441
CHILDREN, I HAVE SOME
DIFFICULT NEWS FOR YOU.

01:20.443 --> 01:23.477
MR. GARRISON WON'T BE
TEACHING FOR A WHILE.

01:23.479 --> 01:25.813
HE HAS TO
HAVE SURGERY!

01:25.815 --> 01:27.181
( cheers )

01:27.183 --> 01:30.284
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER!

01:30.286 --> 01:31.285
( moans )

01:31.287 --> 01:33.020
AND I WANT YOU
TO SHOW THE SUBSTITUTE

01:33.022 --> 01:36.924
THE SAME RESPECT
YOU SHOW FOR MR. GARRISON.

01:37.427 --> 01:38.226
YES, LITTLE BOY?

01:38.228 --> 01:40.528
WE DON'T HAVE RESPECT
FOR MR. GARRISON.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.395
OH.

01:41.397 --> 01:45.533
ANY-HOO, I WANT YOU ALL

WHOA!
WHOA!

01:50.540 --> 01:52.573
WOW,
SHE'S<i> PRETTY.</i>

01:52.575 --> 01:54.108
( mumbling )

01:54.110 --> 01:55.409
YOU CAN

01:56.913 --> 01:57.745
GOOD LUCK,
MISS ELLEN.

01:57.747 --> 02:00.881
IF THEY GET OUT OF CONTROL,
JUST USE THIS TEAR GAS.

02:00.883 --> 02:02.216
THANK YOU.

02:02.218 --> 02:03.584
I'M SURE
I'LL BE FINE.

02:03.586 --> 02:07.955
YOU MUST BE VERY UPSET ABOUT
YOUR TEACHER HAVING SURGERY,

02:07.957 --> 02:12.260
BUT I PROMISE I'LL TRY TO MAKE
THINGS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

02:12.262 --> 02:13.728
FOR ALL OF US.

02:13.730 --> 02:14.929

02:14.931 --> 02:16.197
STAN?

02:16.199 --> 02:16.664
STAN!

02:16.666 --> 02:18.132
NOW LET ME TRY
AND LEARN YOUR NAMES

02:18.134 --> 02:19.567
BY YOUR
SEATING ASSIGNMENTS.

02:19.569 --> 02:21.802
YOU ARE
ERIC CARTMAN?

02:21.804 --> 02:22.670
YES, MA'AM!

02:22.672 --> 02:25.740
OKAY, AND,
YOU MUST BE STAN MARSH!

02:27.477 --> 02:29.510
DO YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE?

02:29.512 --> 02:31.646
NO, HE ALWAYS PUKES
WHEN HE'S IN LOVE.

02:31.648 --> 02:33.014
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS,
CARTMAN!

02:33.016 --> 02:35.650
SO YOU'RE ALRIGHT?

02:36.386 --> 02:39.287
DUDE, YOU HAD
WAFFLES FOR BREAKFAST!

02:41.391 --> 02:44.759
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I'M STILL EMBARRASSED
ABOUT GETTING A NOSE JOB.

02:44.761 --> 02:47.028
I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
AT SCHOOL TO KNOW,

02:47.030 --> 02:48.195
SO I TOLD THEM
I HAD HERPES.

02:48.197 --> 02:50.031
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
EMBARRASSED, MR. GARRISON.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.133
PEOPLE HAVE COSMETIC SURGERY
ALL THE TIME.

02:52.135 --> 02:54.535
BEFORE WE START,
THIS COMPUTER CAN HELP YOU

02:54.537 --> 02:56.704
PICK WHAT KIND OF
NOSE YOU WANT.

02:56.706 --> 02:59.540
ISN'T THAT AMAZING,
MR. HAT?

02:59.542 --> 03:01.208
IT SURE IS,
MR. GARRISON!

03:01.210 --> 03:03.844
WE COULD GO WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE SMALLER,

03:03.846 --> 03:06.347
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU
LOOK LIKE<i> THIS.</i>

03:06.349 --> 03:07.848
( Mr. Garrison )
HMM...

03:07.850 --> 03:09.483
OR WE COULD
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE BRIDGE

03:09.485 --> 03:11.852
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU
LOOK LIKE THIS.

03:11.854 --> 03:13.154
OH THAT'S
NOT BAD.

03:13.156 --> 03:14.588
OF COURSE WE COULD
NARROW THE BRIDGE,

03:14.590 --> 03:18.292
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU
LOOK MORE LIKE<i> THIS.</i>

03:19.862 --> 03:21.095
WOW!
THAT'S IT!

03:21.097 --> 03:22.797
THAT'S THE NOSE
I WANT!

03:22.799 --> 03:23.998
ALRIGHTY THEN.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.599
NOW I MUST
WARN YOU,

03:25.601 --> 03:26.600
THAT THERE
ARE RISKS.

03:26.602 --> 03:29.837
YOU COULD WIND UP A HIDEOUS,
FOUL, SHADOW OF A CREATURE.

03:29.839 --> 03:31.339
SO TERRIFYINGLY UGLY

03:31.341 --> 03:32.807
THAT YOU ARE FORCED
TO LIVE IN THE SEWERS,

03:32.809 --> 03:36.577
ONLY EMERGING AT NIGHT
FOR SOME SCRAPS OF FOOD.

03:37.380 --> 03:38.145
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

03:38.147 --> 03:40.414
ALRIGHTY THEN,
LET'S GET STARTED!

03:41.951 --> 03:44.752
SHE WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU,
SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME!

03:44.754 --> 03:46.153
THAT GOES WITHOUT
SAYING, FAT-ASS.

03:46.155 --> 03:47.321
HOW COULD SHE<i> HELP</i>
BUT LOOK AT YOU?

03:47.323 --> 03:49.857
YOU GUYS CAN STOP FIGHTING,
IT WAS ME SHE WAS CHECKING OUT.

03:49.859 --> 03:51.325
UNTIL YOU
PUKED ON HER.

03:51.327 --> 03:52.126
HELLO THERE,
CHILDREN.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.329
WHAT'S ALL THIS I'M HEARING

03:55.331 --> 03:57.231

03:59.936 --> 04:01.469

04:04.273 --> 04:05.940

04:08.845 --> 04:10.044

04:11.647 --> 04:14.582
STAN, DIDN'T YOU NOTICE
HOW HER LEFT ARM

04:14.584 --> 04:16.784
IS LONGER
THAN THE RIGHT ONE?

04:16.786 --> 04:17.618
NO.

04:17.620 --> 04:18.285
WELL IT IS!

04:18.287 --> 04:19.720
THAT'S OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY

04:19.722 --> 04:22.523
ABOUT WOMEN WITH ONE ARM
LONGER THAT THE OTHER.

04:22.525 --> 04:24.425
( mumbling )

04:24.427 --> 04:25.092
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:25.094 --> 04:27.561
DID YOU NOTICE THAT MOLE
ON THE BACK OF HER NECK

04:27.563 --> 04:28.963
WITH THE HAIR
GROWING OUT OF IT?

04:28.965 --> 04:30.531
THAT'S OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY

04:30.533 --> 04:32.199
ABOUT WOMEN WITH A MOLE
ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECKS

04:32.201 --> 04:35.202
WITH HAIR GROWIN'
OUT OF IT.

04:37.373 --> 04:40.374

MR. GARRISON,
MR. GARRISON!

07:43.593 --> 07:46.126
WHERE AM I?

07:46.128 --> 07:48.495
THE OPERATION IS OVER,
MR. GARRISON.

07:48.497 --> 07:51.966
I FEEL WEAK,
HOW DO I LOOK?

07:51.968 --> 07:53.734
YOU LOOK GREAT!

07:53.736 --> 07:56.036
I FEEL
KIND OF NAUSEOUS.

07:56.038 --> 07:58.072
YES, THAT'S
TO BE EXPECTED.

07:58.074 --> 08:00.107
WE DID SOME
MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION,

08:00.109 --> 08:01.542
SAWED THROUGH
SOME BONE,

08:01.544 --> 08:02.876
SNAPPED SOME
CARTILAGE.

08:02.878 --> 08:04.878
ALL THE BLOOD
AND MUCOUS,

08:04.880 --> 08:08.182
JUST THE SOUND OF
BONE AND SINEW COMING APART.

08:21.831 --> 08:23.564
I'M SORRY
MR. GARRISON,

08:23.566 --> 08:24.798
WHY DON'T YOU
GET SOME REST?

08:24.800 --> 08:27.601
I'LL CHECK ON YOU
A LITTLE LATER.

08:28.804 --> 08:30.437
I WAITED THROUGH
THAT ENTIRE MOVIE

08:30.439 --> 08:34.074
JUST TO SEE THE ALIEN
AND IT WAS HER GODAMN FATHER.

08:35.444 --> 08:36.410
( school bell )

08:36.412 --> 08:38.178
OKAY, KIDS,

10:38.200 --> 10:39.733
I WAS JUST IN
THE BATHROOM,

10:39.735 --> 10:40.934
AND MISS ELLEN
WAS IN THERE

10:40.936 --> 10:43.437
TAKING THE BIGGEST
DUMP I'VE EVER SEEN!

10:43.439 --> 10:44.738

10:45.775 --> 10:47.007

IMPOSSIBLE!

10:47.009 --> 10:47.541

10:49.478 --> 10:51.478
SHE SAYS SHE
CAN'T CONTROL IT!

10:51.480 --> 10:51.979
UH-UH!

10:51.981 --> 10:55.516
IT'S LIKE A DEAD CALF
ROTTING IN THE HOT SUN!

10:55.518 --> 10:56.617
OH COOL!

10:56.619 --> 10:57.084
HEY WENDY,

10:57.086 --> 10:59.686
YOU NEED TO STOP
WITH THIS WHOLE
JEALOUSY THING.

10:59.688 --> 11:01.622
YEAH, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A FREAK, WENDY.

11:01.624 --> 11:05.125
NO, I'M NOT ACTING
LIKE A FREAK!!

11:10.332 --> 11:12.533
HEY MAN, SOMEONE'S
GOTTA PULL THAT MONKEY

11:12.535 --> 11:13.767

11:13.769 --> 11:14.935
HELLO THERE
CHILDREN.

11:14.937 --> 11:15.435
HEY CHEF.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.171
HOW DID YOUR DATE
WITH MISS ELLEN GO?

11:17.173 --> 11:18.205
NOT TOO GOOD.

11:18.207 --> 11:18.705
WHAT HAPPENED,

11:18.707 --> 11:19.807
DIDN'T YOU MAKE
SWEET LOVE TO HER?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.575
NO, NO, NO,
SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:21.577 --> 11:24.144
YOU SEE,
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

11:24.146 --> 11:25.012
CHILDREN,

11:25.014 --> 11:27.214
MISS ELLEN DOESN'T
EXACTLY PLAY

11:27.216 --> 11:29.049
FOR THE RIGHT TEAM.

11:30.252 --> 11:32.052
IN OTHER WORDS
CHILDREN,

11:32.054 --> 11:33.720
SHE'S NOT
A MEMBER OF

11:33.722 --> 11:36.623
THE HETEROSEXUAL
PERSUASION.

11:37.526 --> 11:38.892
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

11:38.894 --> 11:40.260
SHE'S A LESBIAN.

11:40.262 --> 11:41.295
A WHAT-BIAN?

11:41.297 --> 11:41.929
A PLEBEIAN?!

11:41.931 --> 11:44.331
YOU BOYS DON'T KNOW
WHAT A LESBIAN IS?!

11:44.333 --> 11:46.633
KENNY?

11:47.102 --> 11:48.669
NO, EXPLAIN IT
TO US CHEF.

11:48.671 --> 11:50.504
THAT'S OKAY,
LOOK-

11:50.506 --> 11:52.039
ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW IS,

11:52.041 --> 11:53.240
MISS ELLEN'S
A LESBIAN,

11:53.242 --> 11:55.709
THAT MEANS SHE ONLY LIKES
OTHER LESBIANS.

11:55.711 --> 11:56.443
OH.

11:56.445 --> 11:57.344
NOW MOVE ALONG
CHILDREN,

11:57.346 --> 11:59.046
YOU'RE HOLDIN'
UP THE LINE.

11:59.048 --> 11:59.546
WEAK DUDE,

11:59.548 --> 12:00.614
SHE ONLY LIKES
OTHER LESBIANS?

12:00.616 --> 12:02.549
HEY MAN, IF SHE ONLY
LIKES OTHER LESBIANS,

12:02.551 --> 12:05.252
THEN ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS BECOME LESBIANS TOO!

12:05.254 --> 12:05.953
HEY YEAH!

12:05.955 --> 12:07.054
HEY GUYS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:07.056 --> 12:08.522
MY GRANDMA WAS
DUTCH-IRISH,

12:08.524 --> 12:09.756
AND MY GRANDPA
WAS LESBIAN.

12:09.758 --> 12:10.958
THAT MAKES ME
QUARTER LESBIAN.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.125
YOU'RE JUST
SAYIN' THAT CARTMAN.

12:12.127 --> 12:13.961
YOU'RE NOT A LESBIAN
FAT-ASS!

12:13.963 --> 12:15.262
I AM TOO!

12:15.497 --> 12:17.931
OKAY, ONLY A FEW MORE
BANDAGES TO GO.

12:17.933 --> 12:18.699
WELL?

12:18.701 --> 12:21.201

A DIFFERENCE.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.351
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

12:37.353 --> 12:39.853

TO BECOME A LESBIAN

12:39.855 --> 12:41.588
YOU HAVE TO
LICK CARPET!

12:41.590 --> 12:42.289

16:41.630 --> 16:43.430
YOU HAVE TO MAKE LOVE
DOWN BY THE FIRE,

16:43.432 --> 16:44.598
THAT'S WHAT CHEF
ALWAYS SAYS.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.766
STAN, I'M YOUR
TEACHER, OKAY?

16:46.768 --> 16:48.335
WE'RE ONLY<i> FRIENDS.</i>

16:48.337 --> 16:49.002
BUT WHY?

16:49.004 --> 16:50.704
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE EIGHT.

16:50.706 --> 16:53.006
IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT
A LESBIAN, ISN'T IT?

16:53.008 --> 16:54.708
OH BOY...

16:57.479 --> 16:59.246

17:05.254 --> 17:07.120
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING MR. HAT,

17:07.122 --> 17:09.389
BEING HOT AND SEXY
IS FUN FOR A WHILE,

17:09.391 --> 17:10.824
BUT IT SURE DOES
GET BORING.

17:10.826 --> 17:13.393
YOU CAN SAY THAT
AGAIN MR. GARRISON.

17:13.395 --> 17:15.061
( screaming )

17:15.063 --> 17:16.096

17:16.098 --> 17:18.832

HEY, HEY, HEY!

17:18.834 --> 17:20.834

17:20.836 --> 17:23.203
MR. HAT,
SAVE YOURSELF!

17:23.205 --> 17:24.104
( bell )

17:24.106 --> 17:25.739
SO HOW'D YOUR DATE
WITH MISS ELLEN GO?

17:25.741 --> 17:27.007
DID YOU
MAKE LOVE?

17:27.009 --> 17:28.074
I THINK SO.

17:28.076 --> 17:28.975
NO WAY!

17:28.977 --> 17:29.509
YEP!

17:29.511 --> 17:30.510
DOWN BY THE FIRE?

17:30.512 --> 17:31.378

17:31.380 --> 17:32.846
( mumbling )

17:32.848 --> 17:33.547

17:33.549 --> 17:35.515
GOOD MORNING
CHILDREN.

17:35.517 --> 17:37.584
MISS ELLEN, CAN

17:37.586 --> 17:40.387
SURE, BUT CAN IT WAIT
'TIL AFTER CLASS WENDY?

17:40.389 --> 17:42.589
NO, I JUST HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE

17:42.591 --> 17:44.457
FOR THE WAY
I'VE BEEN ACTING.

17:44.459 --> 17:46.393
OH, THAT'S
OKAY WENDY.

17:46.395 --> 17:47.327
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:47.329 --> 17:48.762
SINCE YOU'RE
HERE TO STAY,

17:48.764 --> 17:50.730
I JUST HOPE
WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

17:50.732 --> 17:52.999
WELL I WOULD
LOVE THAT WENDY.

17:53.001 --> 17:54.467
AND, AHEM,

17:54.469 --> 17:56.503
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO EVERYBODY.

17:56.505 --> 17:58.772
THE WAY I ACTED
WAS WRONG,

17:58.774 --> 18:00.106
AND I'VE
LEARNED FROM IT.

18:00.108 --> 18:03.210
I JUST WISH STAN
AND MISS ELLEN

18:03.212 --> 18:05.946
WILL HAVE ALL THE
HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD.

18:05.948 --> 18:09.015
WENDY, THERE'S NOTHING
BETWEEN ME AND STAN.

18:09.017 --> 18:11.985
