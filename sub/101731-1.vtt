04:19.458 --> 04:23.083
Your sister's calendar
wasn't enough for you?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.708
I guess you'll never be satisfied.

04:29.708 --> 04:30.542
Eat me!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.625
Calendarum Maleficarum!

04:41.875 --> 04:44.958

IT IS A PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE YOU
HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO ATTEND OUR

27:12.350 --> 27:13.433
CHRISTMAS PARTY

27:13.600 --> 27:19.308
CELEBRATED AT HOTEL VERSAILLES.
PLEASE, BE PUNCTUAL.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.042
You are half an hour early.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.708
- Marc?
- Hm?

36:45.583 --> 36:46.500
Are you okay?

36:47.667 --> 36:48.458
Yes.

36:48.625 --> 36:49.292
Okay.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.167
Come, we have to go inside.
Mum and Dad are expecting us.

37:01.792 --> 37:03.333
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, darling.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.375
Marc.
- Daniel.

37:14.667 --> 37:15.708
Glad to see you again.

37:18.917 --> 37:19.958
Let's have a toast!

37:20.875 --> 37:23.792
To our first Christmas together.
Together with Marc!

37:24.583 --> 37:25.375
Cheers.

37:29.417 --> 37:32.000
And that's why, Marc,
the first present is for you.

37:54.875 --> 37:55.958
You know what you have to do?

38:06.625 --> 38:07.208
Yes.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.208
This knife belonged to my Dad.

39:15.917 --> 39:17.708
And he got it from my grandfather.

39:21.542 --> 39:22.542
And now...

39:25.208 --> 39:26.125
It's your turn.

39:29.292 --> 39:30.292
You can do it, honey!

39:33.958 --> 39:34.833
Do it, Marc.

41:18.708 --> 41:20.292
To the young couple, Esther and Marc!

41:22.875 --> 41:23.458
And Marc...

41:26.792 --> 41:27.833
Welcome to the family.

53:46.625 --> 53:47.542
Did you find it?

53:57.500 --> 53:58.333
What's up?

54:30.917 --> 54:31.917
What are you doing?

54:33.625 --> 54:34.750
I don't want to go.

54:36.167 --> 54:37.167
Let's go.

54:43.167 --> 54:44.333
I want to do something.

54:45.750 --> 54:46.750
Do what?

54:50.417 --> 54:52.083
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch!

55:03.042 --> 55:04.500
Listen to me carefully.

55:06.917 --> 55:10.000
We're going home. Now.

55:11.875 --> 55:13.875
He should be in jail.

55:17.917 --> 55:18.917
Maybe it's not him.

55:21.042 --> 55:22.167
Yes it is.

55:30.083 --> 55:31.458
Please, let's go.

55:33.083 --> 55:34.083
Don't worry.

55:36.917 --> 55:38.250
I understand you, really.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.708
You didn't love him.

55:43.458 --> 55:44.667
What are you talking about?

55:48.375 --> 55:49.667
I'm talking about Dad.

55:51.458 --> 55:53.375
You didn't love him like I did.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.750
So pretty.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.250
Mimi, do you want it like this?
Or like this?

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.458
Ta-da! Shall we try
something else this time?

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:04.750
That doll is not yours but mine!

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.708
Give it to me!

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.375
Hey! Excuse me! Mister!

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.875
I hate your hair.

01:05:02.042 --> 01:05:04.250
What the hell did the doll ever do to you?

01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:08.500
Ah, for fuck's sake.

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:16.958
Fucking bitch...da fuck off me!

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.958
Gah, fuck...

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:26.667
Crazy bitch!

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:35.000
Daddy!

01:05:36.917 --> 01:05:38.000
Daddy!

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:39.458
For fuck's sake.

01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:45.917
Daddy, please help me!

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.625
I promise I'll be good.

01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:50.208
I don't wanna die.

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:54.083
Ha-young cut me with the knife.

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.333
Daddy!

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:17.500
Ha-na killed my doll.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:23.125
We should probably get rid of this knife.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:43.875
Wow, a present!

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.292
Open it up and see!

01:06:46.708 --> 01:06:47.708
Ta-da!

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.250
It's a doll.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.000
Ha-young!

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:56.292
This sweet little doll will always
listen to you, and never scream.

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:58.917
Wow, she looks just like my dead sister.

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:01.833
I promised I would give you twins.

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:04.750
Don't harass her, just play with
her for the rest of your life.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.417
Wow, so pretty...

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.333
From now on, you'll be my doll.

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:25.500
I prefer you as a doll.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.083
You talked too much when you were alive.

01:11:52.167 --> 01:11:54.792
LOST COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

01:12:03.292 --> 01:12:04.708
Valentina, what are you doing?

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.792
It's not even Christmas yet,
and you're undoing the tree?

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.333
I hate Christmas, understood?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:17.708
All these lights, everyone
loving each other. Enough!

01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:20.833
Look, Valentina, I've got presents for
Dad and the kids. Where are they?

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:23.167
They're in there, go!

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:24.625
Just leave me alone.

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:27.292
Dad?

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:31.500
Dad?

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.583
Dad, where are you?

01:12:40.792 --> 01:12:41.417
Dad?

01:12:44.792 --> 01:12:45.583
Dad!

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:51.792
Dad, wake up!

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:57.250
Dad, I have a present for you, wake up.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.625
Dad...

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.417
Dad, wake up.

01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:13.458
The kids. The kids!

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:15.083
Kids?

01:13:15.917 --> 01:13:16.833
Kids?

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:40.167
Have you given them the presents?

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.792
Yes. Yes, I have.

01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:47.292
Dad?

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:50.667
Dad?

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:58.042
- Granddad, is she gone?
- Yes. Let's go get her, quick!

01:14:11.125 --> 01:14:13.292
My sister even hangs
herself to get attention.

01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:16.250
- But Mum, she's dead.
- She's dead!

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:34.958
- Hands off!
- Come on, relax.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.500
Man, you're getting on my nerves.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:38.083
Hey!

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:39.333
Easy, bro.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:41.125
I'm not your damn bro!

01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:43.083
Get lost, Schmock.

01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:56.625
I recognized him.

01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:58.875
I'll never forget that face.

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:00.208
Okay, listen.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:01.750
You're gonna mark him.

01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:05.000
I can't do this. His smell makes me sick.

01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:06.333
You don't have to smell him.

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:09.333
<i>In the crowd at the entrance,
you put a mark on his back.</i>

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.333
A "P" for "Pig"!

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:17.500
Hey.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:45.208
<i>You wait outside the door
until we text you.</i>

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.708
Let us pass, our friend has
been drinking too much!

01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:50.917
RAPE

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:56.750
Get off me, you...

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:02.708
No!

01:23:33.292 --> 01:23:35.125
THE PIG IS READY

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:47.208
Girls, watch out, he's waking up!

01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:49.708
Hold him down! Fuck! Shit!

01:23:53.292 --> 01:23:53.958
Fuck!

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:50.333
Do it, Caren.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:57.500
That's not him.

01:24:59.667 --> 01:25:00.875
That's the wrong one!

01:25:11.125 --> 01:25:12.208
You've got the wrong one!

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:28.583
There are no wrong ones.

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.292
I thought about you this year,
I kept everything low cal.

01:43:45.292 --> 01:43:48.000
You should really talk to your
brother about his new business.

01:43:48.292 --> 01:43:50.792
Maybe he's looking for an assistant.

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:53.958
What is this, is it...

01:43:54.417 --> 01:43:55.958
Polyester?
- Polyester.

01:44:35.792 --> 01:44:37.833
...he was driving drunk
and he went to prison.

01:44:43.167 --> 01:44:46.833
Look at those little buns,
I could eat them up!

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.917
Hey-hey! Uncle.

01:44:54.292 --> 01:44:56.542
Isn't she pretty.

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:59.250
To the beauty of youth!

01:44:59.750 --> 01:45:00.458
Rose!

01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:05.500
Come say hello to your uncle. Hm?

01:45:09.417 --> 01:45:10.250
Rose!

01:45:24.083 --> 01:45:26.875
No, sweetheart, Kevin is expecting
an important call from China.

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:31.333
Bring this to the living room,
your cousins must be hungry.

01:46:21.958 --> 01:46:24.500
Leave this here, we'll take care of it.

02:09:01.417 --> 02:09:03.333
- Oh! Krieger.
- Hello.

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:06.000
- Where to?
- To Trapp. On my own!

02:09:06.833 --> 02:09:07.875
Trapp, you dumb pig.

02:09:09.667 --> 02:09:11.667
You'll send this out to
the Japs before five today!

02:09:19.625 --> 02:09:20.958
Ah, you're right on cue.

02:09:21.875 --> 02:09:22.625
Thank you.

02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:37.958
What's this dweeb's number again?
Ah, 6-13.

02:09:39.917 --> 02:09:43.250
Bloody hell! He really gets nothing
done at all, this dipshit!!

02:09:45.042 --> 02:09:47.042
Trapp, that idiot from the sixth floor,
has screwed up the Japan job.

02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.500
Trapp? But I thought he was on sick leave?

02:09:49.667 --> 02:09:51.167
He's not getting extra
vacation for a burnout!

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.958
I told him to show up
and get the crap done.

02:09:55.125 --> 02:09:56.042
I have to get the report.

02:09:56.208 --> 02:09:58.917
Nah, one of the chicks will do it.

02:10:06.792 --> 02:10:07.708
What an asshole.

02:10:35.875 --> 02:10:36.542
Hello?

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.083
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
I just wanted to get something.

02:11:03.292 --> 02:11:05.083
Mr. Trapp? I'm here to get the report.

02:11:10.208 --> 02:11:10.875
Mr. Trapp?

02:11:48.375 --> 02:11:49.500
What a joke.

02:12:07.083 --> 02:12:08.375
What kind of a circus is this?

02:12:25.875 --> 02:12:28.000
You'll send this out to
the Japs before five today!

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:33.333
You'll send this out to
the Japs before five today!

02:12:34.875 --> 02:12:38.792
<i>That idiot from the 6th floor...
This dipshit...Trapp, you dumb pig.</i>

02:13:15.667 --> 02:13:16.833
Will you come back as a trainee?

02:13:19.167 --> 02:13:20.333
Oh, you're serious?

02:13:20.875 --> 02:13:21.708
Yes, of course.

02:13:22.167 --> 02:13:24.458
Once I take over,
a lot will change around here.
