00:02.127 --> 00:03.253
<i>My name is Molly Woods.</i>

00:03.336 --> 00:04.754
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:07.882
<i>My husband John,</i>
<i>a robotics engineer,</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:11.636
<i>created a lifelike robot</i>
<i>called a Humanich.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.431
<i>We adopted the prototype</i>
<i>as our son.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:17.434
<i>His name is Ethan.</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:20.645
<i>Everything changed when I went</i>
<i>to space on a 13-month</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:22.147
<i>solo mission.</i>

00:22.230 --> 00:23.898
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:25.233
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
How is that even possible?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.153
<i>The child-- part human,</i>

00:28.236 --> 00:29.946
<i>part alien-- was unlike</i>

00:30.029 --> 00:31.614
<i>anything the world</i>
<i>had ever seen.</i>

00:31.698 --> 00:33.616
How did you get
so big so fast?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.744
<i>And he was dangerous.</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:37.662
<i>Eventually...</i>
Run!

00:37.746 --> 00:39.622
<i>I lost both of my sons.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.624
Ethan!
Mom!

00:41.708 --> 00:43.626
<i>And my husband.</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:45.837
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>I've gone crazy.</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:47.756
This is a cover-up!
That's what this is!

00:47.839 --> 00:49.758
Get your hands off of me!

00:49.841 --> 00:52.093
<i>I say there's</i>
<i>more to the story.</i>

00:52.177 --> 00:54.262
<i>It's up to me to find the truh</i>

00:54.345 --> 00:57.182
<i>before it's too late.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.643
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

01:00.727 --> 01:02.520
It's an invasion.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.608
Who is he?
My son.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.778
{\an1}Make me a virus
that kills them, not us.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.154
{\an1}Do you hear that?
Hear what?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.698
It's saying, "Help me."

01:13.782 --> 01:15.116
This the first time
you've heard voices?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.993
I think I'm going crazy.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.120
<i>And I'm blacking out</i>
<i>and I'm ending up in places</i>

01:19.204 --> 01:20.830
<i>and I have no idea</i>
<i>how I got there.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:22.332
ANNA:
May I present Lucy,

01:22.415 --> 01:25.710
the future of Humanichs.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.379
{\an5}You have a problem
with authority.
You make it sound so serious.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.381
Nothing that can't be fixed
with a few lines of code.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.883
Don't change me, Charlie.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.843
It'll be our secret.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.514
Do you think I wanted to wipe
his memories of Molly?

01:37.597 --> 01:40.183
{\an6}He shut off his GPS.
Guess he doesn't
want to be found.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.019
GINA: Hello, Ethan.
Nice to see you again.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.909
{\an3}We've had 58
pregnant women die

01:57.992 --> 02:00.703
in four months from these
births. That we know of.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.206
Which means 58 potential hybrids

02:03.289 --> 02:06.000
of unknown age
that are out there.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.503
{\an4}Somewhere.
It's the where
that is elusive.

02:09.586 --> 02:12.215
They've been strangely silent.
There's no new blips.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.884
{\an1}Our thermal trackers
have lost all sign of them.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.386
It's like they've
gone underground.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.762
{\an3}Literally.
They're out there.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.889
They're hiding in plain sight.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.852
Question is...

02:23.935 --> 02:26.771
what are they doing?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.898
And what are they planning?

02:33.528 --> 02:36.364
Seem to be having a little bit
of a logjam in the ankle area.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.617
(laughs)

02:39.701 --> 02:41.744
Boots are not a deal breaker.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.080
I can work around
your pants, too.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.875
Oh, I do love
a resourceful woman.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.919
Hmm.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.089
Okay...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.966
where were we?

02:56.634 --> 02:58.970
(knocking)

03:00.889 --> 03:03.975
(pounding)

03:04.058 --> 03:05.810
{\an3}Seriously?
I know.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.770
This is just a...

03:07.854 --> 03:11.065
minor setback, okay?
I'll be right...

03:11.149 --> 03:13.234
I'll be right back, I promise.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.156
{\an6}(sighs)
You're not answering
your phone.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.408
{\an1}Because I don't
want to talk right now.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.452
{\an1}So if this is another
planetary alert,

03:22.535 --> 03:24.329
{\an1}consider me warned
and sufficiently medicated

03:24.412 --> 03:26.039
to go painlessly.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.795
{\an1}Are you having
another one of your episodes?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.714
No. It's not that.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.636
{\an1}Oh, God, I'm interrupting.
No,

03:39.719 --> 03:41.763
actually,
we're finished.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.396
Come on in.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.989
{\an3}Your scooter
looks much better.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.407
But you missed
a spot, Ethan.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.785
{\an1}Thanks, Richard.
That scratch is paint-deep.

04:03.868 --> 04:07.288
{\an5}I'll have to buff it out.
I would help you, but
I don't have any arms.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.292
{\an4}Thanks for getting
my scooter back.
For my

04:11.376 --> 04:13.127
baby brother, anything.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.879
You've always got me
to protect you.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.426
So, did Charlie
tell you who she was? Molly?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.054
He said I probably saw her
on TV or something.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.848
{\an3}A glitch in my system
made me think I had met her.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.309
But she had a picture of me
in her house.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.312
The kind of picture
families take together.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.440
They're hiding something
from you, Ethan.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.192
But why?

04:36.275 --> 04:38.486
That's a good question.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.196
And you have the right to ask.

04:40.279 --> 04:43.241
{\an3}Technically, Humanichs
don't have rights.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.201
{\an1}Sometimes you have to fight
for your rights, Richard.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.328
That's what history teaches us.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.330
Did you leave the message
like I told you?

04:51.457 --> 04:53.501
Good. Then she'll
come looking for you.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.807
A prank?
That's what you think this is?

05:07.890 --> 05:09.350
Maybe you pissed off
your cleaning lady.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.686
{\an1}Gina, pull up all the data
from yesterday.

05:11.769 --> 05:15.064
I'm sorry, Molly, but I don't
have data from that time period.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.859
So my vengeful cleaning lady--
that I don't have--

05:17.942 --> 05:20.528
hacked into
my very secure AI system

05:20.611 --> 05:23.614
and erased
her tracks?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.366
(rapid beeping)

05:26.951 --> 05:29.037
What are
you doing?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.956
It would take a techno-nerd
to erase Gina's memory.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.374
And techno-nerds,

05:33.458 --> 05:35.543
well, they're a bit myopic.

05:35.626 --> 05:39.130
They forget the old-school
methods of police investigation.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.300
Like fingerprinting.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.968
All right, smarty-pants.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.721
Who is Charles Arthurs?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.934
♪ I'll tell you
why I love you... ♪

05:52.018 --> 05:54.270
Hi there. I'm Gavin.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.689
♪ How I deceive you ♪

05:59.192 --> 06:03.112
♪ How I treat you ♪

06:03.196 --> 06:06.240
♪ So do it all the time ♪

06:16.375 --> 06:19.462
♪ I'll tell you
why I love you... ♪

06:19.545 --> 06:21.672
You ever stood a girl up before?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.758
No, ma'am.
Good.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.301
Then buy me a drink.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.762
Restore my faith in mankind?

06:27.845 --> 06:31.474
That doesn't look like a drink.
It looks like a lava lamp.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.684
All they have
is the synth stuff.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.603
Goes down easier
with a little soda.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.481
I heard this place keeps a stash

06:38.564 --> 06:41.192
of really old whiskey
hidden in the back.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.498
{\an1}I've got the target. Do I have
permission to take him out?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.291
MAN:
Permission granted.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.172
Oh!

07:04.966 --> 07:06.592
(grunts)

07:08.886 --> 07:11.055
WOMAN:
Kill confirmed.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.599
Combat simulation terminated.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.646
That's a creative simulation.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.064
That was Charlie's idea.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.524
{\an1}Well, I know the hybrids
have been preying

07:21.607 --> 07:23.025
{\an1}on women in bars,
so, you know,

07:23.109 --> 07:25.194
I thought this would
help Lucy prepare for

07:25.278 --> 07:26.696
the task at hand.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.322
{\an3}Well, she seemed
resourceful,

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
{\an1}quick on her feet to employ
alternative strategies.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.535
Her stress receptors
didn't engage at all,

07:32.618 --> 07:34.328
even when she lost
her weapon. I was

07:34.412 --> 07:36.455
expecting a delay
in her synaptic response time,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.707
given the limiters
you installed.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.417
Uh, I'm just that good, I guess.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.543
What limiters?

07:40.626 --> 07:43.045
Compliance limiters.
To make sure she obeys orders.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.382
Well, now that I'm a perfectly
compliant soldier--

07:46.465 --> 07:47.717
{\an1}thanks to Charlie--
will I be

07:47.800 --> 07:49.552
{\an1}sent out into the field?
Well, when we

07:49.635 --> 07:51.429
locate the targets,
and we're working on that.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.723
But you just consider this
your basic training.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.474
And you passed
with flying colors, Lucy.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.102
Julie, a word?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.562
Sure.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.858
{\an3}See?

08:03.941 --> 08:07.361
Aren't you glad you didn't
install the limiters?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.488
I told you I'd be much better
without them.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.449
(quiet scoff)
ANNA: <i> We have a problem.</i>

08:11.532 --> 08:13.075
{\an3}With Lucy? I thought
you were happy with...

08:13.159 --> 08:14.911
With Ethan.
We've discovered

08:14.994 --> 08:17.371
that he had a little adventure
while you were away.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.416
{\an1}What?
He disabled his GPS,

08:20.499 --> 08:21.876
{\an1}so we're not sure
of the details, but you might

08:21.959 --> 08:23.044
want to find out.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.921
Of course.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.549
{\an1}Maybe it's time to place
those same limiters on Ethan.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.596
SHEPHERD: <i> What's the status</i>
<i>on the virus team?</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:35.806
{\an1}There was
a breakthrough yesterday.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.601
{\an1}It turns out the stunt
Molly pulled with indexes

08:38.683 --> 08:41.687
actually yielded results.
Nobody is hearing voices, but...

08:43.481 --> 08:45.691
{\an1}they think that
she's discovered the primer.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.611
{\an1}It's as though she reached
into a box of junk DNA cereal

08:48.694 --> 08:49.737
and pulled out
a decoder ring.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.240
The team is working
on a new virus strain right now,

08:52.323 --> 08:54.575
{\an1}but they
could really use her help.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.661
What's the problem?
She never showed up

08:56.744 --> 08:58.037
for work, Toby.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.455
{\an1}WOMAN:
Sir, I have your sister

08:59.538 --> 09:00.790
on the line again.
She's asking

09:00.873 --> 09:02.833
about your niece's
birthday party.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.628
Tell her I'll call her back.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.678
Privacy mode.
(soft chime)

09:17.056 --> 09:19.684
{\an3}Toby, when was the
last time you slept?

09:19.767 --> 09:22.979
{\an3}We have to take
care of ourselves.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.606
It seems strange to sleep.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
Eat.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.320
Go to birthday parties under the
circumstances, don't you think?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.322
This invasion is slow.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.157
It is insidious.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.160
We still have to live our
lives, find some normalcy.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.664
We don't have the luxury
of normalcy right now.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.667
We used to talk about
having a family.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.460
Shayna, we're at war.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.713
{\an1}We're always at war.
This is different.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.881
We both know it.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.633
We could quit tomorrow.

09:52.717 --> 09:56.387
{\an3}We could forget about all
this, we could have babies.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.223
{\an3}Isn't that the best
defense against

09:59.307 --> 10:01.809
everything that's happening?

10:01.892 --> 10:04.186
Do you know
how insane you sound?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.229
{\an3}Insane.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.276
That seems to be attractive
to you these days.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.661
How could you let this happen
and not tell me?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.538
I looked like a complete ass

10:22.621 --> 10:24.790
{\an4}in front of Anna.
I'm sorry, okay?
Just calm down.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.376
{\an4}I didn't realize the GSC
had a tracker on him.
So that's why you lied--

10:27.460 --> 10:29.003
{\an4}'cause you thought
you wouldn't get caught?
No, because I didn't

10:29.086 --> 10:31.255
want to freak you out.
You were 3,000 miles away.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.924
{\an6}We got him back, he's safe.
So where the hell
did he go, Charlie?

10:34.008 --> 10:36.677
HANK:
You have a visitor, Julie.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.729
We need to talk.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.453
You can't be here.
I have a restraining order.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.038
Well, there's a lot of people
in places they shouldn't be.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.957
{\an1}Oh, crap.
Like Charlie,

11:07.041 --> 11:08.751
who broke into my apartment.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.212
{\an6}What?
And there was
a message there

11:11.295 --> 11:15.925
from Ethan. Now, I know there's
no love lost between us, Julie,

11:16.008 --> 11:19.136
{\an5}but if you know anything
about...
ETHAN: Mom?

11:20.971 --> 11:22.681
Ethan?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.979
Is that you?

11:29.063 --> 11:32.608
{\an3}Oh, my God,
it is you.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.277
Ethan.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.987
Oh, sweetheart,

11:37.071 --> 11:39.532
I missed you.
I do know you.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.411
Yes, of course you do.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.663
I'm your mother.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.124
No.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.543
{\an1}She is.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.509
What did you do to him?

11:58.592 --> 12:00.678
Charlie, take Ethan
to his bedroom, please.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.974
But...

12:05.057 --> 12:06.225
{\an1}CHARLIE:
Come on, pal.

12:09.228 --> 12:13.149
{\an5}You'd better start talking fast.
Hank, call 911.
I have an intruder.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.317
{\an4}Yes, Julie.
All right.
All right. Molly.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.028
{\an3}My name is JD Richter,
Patrol Special.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.448
{\an1}You do realize
that theft, kidnapping,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.992
{\an1}whatever the hell
this is is a felony.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.162
I didn't kidnap him. I have
official documents from HomeSec.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.456
I am Ethan's legal custodian.
You are trespassing

12:28.539 --> 12:30.332
{\an1}on my property.
You have obviously

12:30.416 --> 12:32.460
done something to his memories.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.462
{\an1}I was protecting him.
From what?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.172
The truth?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.716
{\an3}What kind of monster does
this to a little boy?

12:38.799 --> 12:41.385
{\an1}What would
John have to say?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.053
{\an3}I think he'd
say a lot,

12:43.137 --> 12:45.347
mostly about what kind of wife
and mother you were.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.349
Oh, really? Really?
I suggest you leave

12:47.433 --> 12:48.976
if you don't want
to find yourself in jail.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.395
{\an3}All right, let's be
easy. Easy, easy.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.689
{\an1}(sirens wailing in distance)
Molly. Hey.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.192
{\an3}Look at me. All right,
unless you want to end up

12:56.275 --> 12:59.195
{\an3}where we first met,
we should get out of here.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.038
I will be coming back for him,
Julie.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.248
You can count on it.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.176
{\an5}I ought to go back in there
right now and take him.
All right, let's think

13:22.259 --> 13:24.178
about this for a second,
all right?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.722
Now, I don't want to speak out
of turn, but there is no way

13:26.805 --> 13:29.099
that Julie Frick and
Charlie Frack orchestrated this

13:29.183 --> 13:31.101
{\an1}on their own.
Of course they didn't.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.103
HomeSec is behind
the whole thing.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.356
{\an3}The question
is why.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.608
Why would they give Julie
my son?

13:37.691 --> 13:42.363
Now, there's got to be some kind
of missing piece to this puzzle.

13:42.446 --> 13:47.409
What happened
after they took Ethan?

13:48.452 --> 13:51.956
My husband died.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.791
(door opens)

13:56.961 --> 13:58.629
Hey, Rabbit.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.756
She's my mom?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.718
She was your mom.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.470
For a little while.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.264
You lived with her and John,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.975
{\an4}but then Molly got
really sick.
She didn't look sick.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.102
You reprogrammed
me to forget her.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.603
I have the right to know why.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.147
Well, when Molly couldn't
care for you anymore,

14:17.231 --> 14:19.108
you got really sad.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.403
{\an1}I thought if I erased her
from your memory,

14:22.486 --> 14:26.282
you wouldn't be so sad anymore.

14:26.365 --> 14:30.953
If she's my mom,
then who are you?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.248
Molly helped raise you,

14:34.331 --> 14:36.000
but Charlie and I

14:36.083 --> 14:38.127
{\an3}worked with John
to create you.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.254
{\an1}Right here,
with us,

14:40.337 --> 14:41.922
is where you were always meant
to be.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.133
I want Lucy.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.138
JOHN:
<i>Molly, please pick up.</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:51.515
I'm sorry
for the pain I've caused, but...

14:51.599 --> 14:55.144
I have to tell you something.
I'm going to call Der...

14:55.227 --> 14:56.937
(beep)

14:57.021 --> 15:00.149
And that...

15:00.232 --> 15:02.109
{\an3}was the
last time

15:02.192 --> 15:03.902
I heard his voice.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.367
You testify to Congress,

15:10.451 --> 15:12.453
you find out

15:12.536 --> 15:15.164
{\an1}John and Julie
are having an affair,

15:15.247 --> 15:17.499
and men with guns break
into your house.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.336
They take Ethan away.
And then...

15:20.419 --> 15:23.172
John is dead.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.174
And I...

15:25.257 --> 15:30.346
end up
at RestWell Recovery Center.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.349
And Julie has Ethan.

15:33.432 --> 15:38.187
Yeah, I'm not one of those guys
who wears a tinfoil hat, but...

15:38.270 --> 15:41.148
Molly, nobody is that unlucky.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.025
Not even you.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.986
Unless...

15:46.070 --> 15:50.324
{\an3}his death wasn't
an accident.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.326
{\an3}I need to know
what happened to him.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.244
{\an3}And why.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.330
Will you help me?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.540
Answers aren't gonna be easy
to come by, not where

15:58.624 --> 16:01.210
{\an1}the government is concerned.
In case you forgot,

16:01.293 --> 16:02.711
{\an3}I lost my license, so...
Okay,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.214
but I-I'm not asking you
for a favor, JD.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.550
This is a job. I mean,
you have bills to pay, right?

16:08.634 --> 16:12.096
It's not about the money, Molly.
It's about getting my life back.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.139
All right? It...
Believe it or not,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.350
I had a life before I met you.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.561
Okay. Well,
then go back to your life.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.397
And screw your brains out.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.775
All right, you know what,
that's not fair.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.945
Where are you going?
To get my son.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.907
SHEPHERD:
<i>What is it</i>

16:31.990 --> 16:34.118
{\an5}that's so urgent?
Oh, I think it's my
turn to ask questions.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.496
Like how the hell did Julie
Gelineau end up with my son?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.251
Say you don't know, Toby.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.546
It's, um...

16:45.629 --> 16:49.383
{\an6}complicated.
When things
get complicated,

16:49.466 --> 16:52.094
does somebody end up getting hit
by a train?

16:52.177 --> 16:55.097
You think I had something
to do with John's death?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.432
Well, what's one more body bag

16:56.515 --> 16:58.934
{\an3}for the greater good?
He was my friend.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.438
And so was I. And you had no
problem dropping a drone on me.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.397
Now, if I don't
get my son back,

17:04.481 --> 17:06.275
not only will I not help you
with your damn virus,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.318
but I'm gonna go to the press

17:08.402 --> 17:10.445
{\an3}and I'm gonna tell 'em exactly
what's been going on here.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.449
{\an3}I will scream aliens
from the rooftops.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.285
I will be your worst nightmare.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.078
And you will bring
the whole world down with you.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.372
So be it.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.963
VELEZ:
What is it, Toby?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.840
We have a problem.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.219
(footsteps echoing loudly)

17:41.059 --> 17:42.561
(elevator dings loudly)

17:51.403 --> 17:53.447
(sighs)

17:56.867 --> 17:58.452
Go away.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.454
{\an1}Nobody's
home.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.081
(keys jangle)

18:07.294 --> 18:10.005
Are we cooking today, Sarge?

18:10.088 --> 18:14.551
{\an1}No, Private.
We are not cooking today.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.472
I'm sorry.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.848
{\an1}Do I know you?
Really, man?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
Why don't you save that crap
for the V.A.?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.853
Got to keep the act sharp, JD.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.190
(chuckles)
My benefits are getting thin.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.483
Yeah, that's the only thing
that's thin

18:29.566 --> 18:31.401
around here these days.
(laughs)

18:31.485 --> 18:33.403
Get your ass up.
Good to see you, man.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.655
Good to see you, too.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.866
So... this a Patrol Special job?

18:37.950 --> 18:41.411
{\an3}Not exactly. I may
have lost my license,

18:41.495 --> 18:43.580
{\an3}so this is more
of a private deal.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.833
How's the money?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.543
We shall see.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.836
Oh.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.546
(laughing):
It's a woman.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.548
It's a woman.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.299
Maybe.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.052
Here's what I got.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.720
{\an3}What do
you think?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.930
Think we can go to work?

19:00.013 --> 19:01.557
Yeah.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.392
I think we can do something.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.726
Hope she's pretty.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.728
She's all right.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.523
MAN:
Vehicle data recorder?

19:09.606 --> 19:12.568
This is the black box.
Where'd you get this stuff?

19:12.651 --> 19:15.404
Insurance investigator. Of
course, I had to buy him dinner

19:15.487 --> 19:17.030
at Manny's.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.366
Is that all it
takes nowadays?

19:19.449 --> 19:23.245
{\an5}I'll have you know that a good
steak dinner is hard to come by.
(chuckles)

19:23.328 --> 19:26.039
So, the accident report says
that the safety protocols

19:26.123 --> 19:29.084
were overridden
by the car's owner, John Woods.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.586
What do you think, man?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.546
You think you can figure out
what really happened?

19:32.629 --> 19:34.298
For a steak dinner at Manny's?

19:34.381 --> 19:37.301
{\an3}(laughing):
Well, yes, Sarge, I can.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.303
{\an1}I should never
have mentioned that.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.930
But you did.
I did.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.390
{\an3}Yes.
All right.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.516
You figure it out,
will you call me?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.434
{\an3}Will do.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.437
Reprogramming you.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.355
There should be a law
against that.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.107
But there's not.

19:52.190 --> 19:55.235
Julie said she did it
to stop me from feeling sad.

19:55.319 --> 19:59.156
She lied once. Who knows
what else she's lying about?

19:59.239 --> 20:02.075
{\an3}That seems like <i> her</i>
normal operating system.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.619
They should reprogram her.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.621
(chuckles)

20:05.704 --> 20:07.497
Do you want to play
a game or something?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.708
What kind?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.963
ETHAN'S VOICE:
I'm Ethan Woods,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.089
{\an3}the world's

20:16.173 --> 20:18.258
first Humanich.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.594
{\an6}How'd you do that?
I gained
root access

20:20.677 --> 20:23.513
to your remote server and
downloaded your speech software.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.349
Try mine.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.646
LUCY'S VOICE:
Did it work?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.147
Whoa.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.815
{\an1}I'm Lucy,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.776
soldier, warrior,

20:35.859 --> 20:38.820
queen of the entire
Humanichs army.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.447
We need to stick together.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.658
We can't trust anyone.

20:42.741 --> 20:43.659
Only each other.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.495
The revolution starts here.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.135
{\an3}Madam Secretary.
Tobias.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.888
Anna.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.351
Toby. It's been a while.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.186
WOMAN:
<i>That was the plan, wasn't it?</i>

21:11.269 --> 21:13.188
{\an3}Dismantle the bots
4.0 and higher?

21:13.271 --> 21:15.190
I thought the Humanichs
boy had been shut down.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.859
We, uh, ran
into some roadblocks.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.736
We needed leverage.
It was the only way

21:19.820 --> 21:21.154
to secure Julie's commitment

21:21.238 --> 21:22.698
{\an3}to the
Humanich project,

21:22.781 --> 21:24.616
{\an3}so we cut a deal.
A deal

21:24.700 --> 21:26.827
I would not have approved
had Ms. Schaefer been able

21:26.910 --> 21:28.328
to manage her team.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.539
The real problem here
is Molly Woods.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.416
{\an5}I thought that problem
went away.
Well, now she's back,

21:32.499 --> 21:34.960
and she wants the Humanich boy.
Molly's gotten us

21:35.043 --> 21:37.546
closer to a virus
than anyone else.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.841
{\an3}With her help, we have
a fighting chance.

21:40.924 --> 21:45.345
And she's threatened to go
public with what she knows.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.514
Well, who's corralling
that horse, Toby?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.476
{\an3}She's been
through enough.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.395
Ethan's not a threat.

21:53.478 --> 21:57.691
{\an3}Now, we should return him
to his rightful mother.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.569
Julie has overseen
the entire Humanich operation.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.655
If you take Ethan away from her,
she will walk.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
Do you know why I wear
blue suits every day?

22:11.621 --> 22:14.166
Decision fatigue.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.627
Every decision we make
weakens our ability

22:17.711 --> 22:19.421
to make the next one.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.922
I'll run this by Taylor.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.924
He doesn't seem
to suffer this weakness.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.553
You can't delegate this
to Taylor.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.556
{\an1}It's not
what he does.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.604
I understand.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.441
That was Fiona Stanton.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.610
Head of HomeSec?

22:41.693 --> 22:44.404
She wants to meet
with Ethan tonight.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.949
{\an3}Julie...

22:48.033 --> 22:49.951
{\an1}What if they take him
away from me?

22:50.035 --> 22:51.453
{\an3}I'm sorry.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.954
{\an3}I never meant for any
of this to happen.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.164
Just get out.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.542
Please leave.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.263
(sniffling)

23:29.116 --> 23:31.827
(phone rings)

23:31.910 --> 23:34.663
GINA:
Molly, JD Richter is calling.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.748
Accept.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.462
Hi, JD.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.464
Hey, sorry to bother you.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.509
I just... I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.010
I'm drinking.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.513
Alone.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.640
Well, not anymore you're not.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.855
I want you to know
that I'm on this case.

23:59.938 --> 24:04.609
I'm gonna find out what happened
to your husband, I promise.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.990
You're not alone, Molly.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.871
Molly.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.373
Hey, you still there?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.667
I'm losing it, JD.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.211
(crying):
I'm losing it.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.588
I'm losing it.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.173
All right, you stay put.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.424
I'm on my way.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.718
{\an3}So, Ethan,

24:29.801 --> 24:32.554
I've never met a
robot boy before.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.514
{\an3}I must admit, I didn't
expect you to appear so...

24:34.598 --> 24:35.557
Human?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.017
My skin is made

24:37.100 --> 24:39.394
{\an1}from a soft durometer
polyurethane foam

24:39.477 --> 24:41.396
{\an1}and organic
vulcanized latex.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.190
So it looks just
like your skin,

24:43.273 --> 24:45.525
{\an1}only I don't have pores,
so I can't perspire.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.777
{\an1}And I won't get
a sunburn.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.575
I see you're
in pajamas.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.076
So you sleep?

24:55.160 --> 24:56.620
{\an3}And eat?
Yes.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.622
I was built to emulate
the human experience,

24:58.705 --> 25:01.625
{\an1}but I don't need
those things to function.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.169
How old are you?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.629
{\an1}Well, I'm ten
in human years.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.880
How old are you?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.757
{\an3}I'm old enough to be
your grandmother.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.259
{\an1}So between 50
and 65 years old?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.720
{\an3}(chuckling):
Yes.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.013
Between there.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.733
{\an3}So, Ethan, tell me
about yourself.

25:26.816 --> 25:31.321
{\an1}I would, except what I thought
was true about myself isn't.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.699
Well, what do you like to do?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.618
{\an1}I like riding
my scooter.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.286
Going to school.

25:38.370 --> 25:43.124
But I can't go to school anymore
because of the new laws.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.627
How do you like
living with Julie?

25:45.710 --> 25:49.589
Julie feels like my mom, but now
I know that Molly really is...

25:49.673 --> 25:51.591
was my mom.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.843
Do you miss her?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.471
I guess so.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.431
{\an1}My brain is like
a hard drive.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.809
You can delete things, but they
never go away completely.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.813
{\an1}So even though Molly
was erased from my system,

26:04.896 --> 26:06.815
{\an1}she left
an impression.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.733
Do you feel pain and love?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.778
{\an1}Yes, just not
the same as humans.

26:11.861 --> 26:15.156
{\an1}For example, I can't cry,
but I can feel sad.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.909
And how do you
feel now, Ethan?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.620
Sad.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.205
And angry.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.626
VELEZ: <i> We're in the middle</i>
<i>of an invasion,</i>

26:26.710 --> 26:28.837
and we're stopping to have a
custody battle over a robot.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.382
{\an1}Not just a robot;
he's her son.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.384
{\an1}What happened
to "families first"?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.511
{\an1}Going on with
our daily lives, huh?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.682
{\an3}Why do you keep making
excuses for her?

26:40.765 --> 26:43.476
{\an1}Because we did
this to her.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.478
I did this to her.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.858
You cannot carry the weight
of the world forever, Toby.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.693
It will break
your back.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.778
{\an1}Maybe it deserves
to be broken.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.619
GINA:
<i>Molly, you have a visitor.</i>

27:18.762 --> 27:22.057
{\an3}I know it's late,
but I have some news.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.226
Can I come in?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.689
{\an1}Ethan was supposed
to be decommissioned.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.733
That wasn't a lie.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.402
But for reasons I'm not
at liberty to discuss,

27:34.486 --> 27:35.904
he was given to Julie.

27:35.987 --> 27:39.783
{\an3}I didn't like it, but
there was no other way.

27:39.866 --> 27:42.410
Is that your version
of an apology?

27:42.494 --> 27:45.246
{\an3}Look, I make tough
decisions every day.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.374
{\an3}Things I lose
sleep over.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.417
{\an3}But this-- you
and Ethan--

27:49.501 --> 27:51.044
it's haunted me, Molly.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.754
{\an1}Sorry if I don't have much
sympathy for you, Tobe.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.422
{\an3}That's not
why I'm here.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.051
I've arranged a meeting
between you and Fiona Stanton.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.761
She's the head of HomeSec.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.262
{\an3}You can plead your
case for Ethan.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.139
What?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.975
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you get your son back.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.771
That's my apology,
and it'll never be enough.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.649
(groans)

28:12.732 --> 28:14.025
Hey.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.778
Whoa, hey, hey.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.279
{\an1}(groans)

28:18.363 --> 28:19.447
What, are y-you okay?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.616
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

28:21.699 --> 28:24.452
{\an5}Molly, I'm worried
about you.
No. Toby,
you should go.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.745
{\an3}I'm not gonna leave
you like this.

28:25.829 --> 28:26.496
Toby, please.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.498
Before it's too late.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.875
Too late for what?

28:36.047 --> 28:37.799
GINA:
You have a visitor, Molly.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.300
Decline.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.593
GINA:
He has access.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.594
What?!

28:41.678 --> 28:42.846
{\an3}No.

28:43.763 --> 28:46.182
(chuckles)

28:46.266 --> 28:47.809
Well...

28:47.892 --> 28:50.478
so much for drinking alone, huh?

28:56.109 --> 28:58.319
{\an3}Do you always break into
people's apartments?

28:58.403 --> 29:01.990
{\an1}I actually just came by to see
if you were okay, Molly.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.993
{\an5}Well, she is, so...
Who are you,
her bodyguard or something?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.995
I thought I told you to
leave Dr. Woods alone.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.997
{\an1}I just couldn't
stay away.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.667
You know how...
alluring she is.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.085
JD.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.962
{\an3}Can we talk
about this later?

29:17.255 --> 29:18.214
{\an1}Yeah.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.675
{\an1}All right, well,
good luck.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.635
I am rooting
for you two.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.017
I can take care of him if
he's giving you trouble.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.685
No, Toby...

29:30.768 --> 29:31.978
you should go.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.022
Yeah.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.940
Sure.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.151
Your meeting.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.194
{\an1}10:00 a.m.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.362
Try and get some rest.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.198
Yeah.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.011
♪ ♪

30:17.982 --> 30:19.901
Gina, what time is it?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.403
GINA:
It's 9:00, Molly.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.572
(elevator dings)

30:34.165 --> 30:36.876
FIONA:
<i>Some unfortunate things</i>

30:36.960 --> 30:39.420
have happened in the name
of national security,

30:39.504 --> 30:41.047
and we find ourselves
in this room.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.299
Yes, and I appreciate
this opportunity

30:43.383 --> 30:45.301
to plead my case

30:45.385 --> 30:47.220
for the custody of my son.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.972
Let's set the record
straight, Dr. Woods.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.765
This is not an official
custody hearing.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.517
Ethan is not a person
under the law.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.937
Right, he is the property of the
United States government now.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.982
{\an3}Yes, since the GSC
owns Humanichs,

30:59.065 --> 31:01.901
and the GSC sits under Homeland
Security's jurisdiction,

31:01.985 --> 31:04.779
the decision will be
mine and mine alone.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.615
So let's talk.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.618
{\an1}Julie, tell me
about your time with Ethan.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.161
Well, I should
start by saying

31:12.245 --> 31:13.496
{\an3}I designed all the
prosthetics for Ethan.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.540
{\an3}And as someone with
my own prosthetics...

31:15.623 --> 31:17.125
(scoffing):
Sympathy card.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.085
{\an3}Dr. Woods, please,
you'll have your chance.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.254
{\an1}...I understand how Ethan's
synthetic biology works.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.006
I also know
how to program him...

31:23.089 --> 31:24.966
And apparently reprogram him.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.509
Molly doesn't even know
how to code.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.052
And, as you know, she was
just recently released

31:28.136 --> 31:29.304
from psychiatric care
after committing

31:29.387 --> 31:31.431
both arson
and aggravated assault.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.975
I lost my husband and my son.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.351
I was grieving.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.979
{\an3}I have correspondence
from John Woods,

31:38.062 --> 31:40.815
Ethan's father,
where he explicitly states

31:40.898 --> 31:42.984
that Molly had trouble
bonding with Ethan.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.069
We worked through that as a
family, Julie, and you know it.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.613
To quote John,

31:46.696 --> 31:48.364
"She treats him as if
he weren't a living entity

31:48.448 --> 31:51.159
{\an3}but a piece of luggage."
"A piece of luggage"?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.662
You're the one who ripped him
from his home and his family,

31:54.746 --> 31:56.664
just to play
with his head

31:56.748 --> 31:58.499
{\an3}like it was some kind
of computer game.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.126
{\an1}Dr. Woods.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.919
Ms. Gelineau has revisionist
history, Ms. Stanton.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.880
Now, had I known this was gonna
be a show-and-tell,

32:03.963 --> 32:06.674
I would have brought you
a video of her having sex

32:06.758 --> 32:08.509
with my husband in my house.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.971
{\an3}And I especially love the part
where you were telling him

32:12.055 --> 32:14.265
{\an3}how much you love him and how
you wanted him to leave me.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.184
But instead he dumped you.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.186
{\an3}Dr. Woods, I will
not stand for this.

32:18.269 --> 32:22.065
And then, all of a sudden, Ms.
Gelineau here miraculously is

32:22.148 --> 32:24.859
awarded custody of Ethan,
and John is dead.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.653
{\an3}Did you kill him because
you couldn't have him?

32:26.736 --> 32:28.237
Is that what you did?

32:28.321 --> 32:29.030
That's crazy.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.448
Enough.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.200
{\an1}No, it's not nearly
enough-- he's my son.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.077
And I don't care what
the government has to say

32:34.160 --> 32:37.080
or how many times you try
to erase me from his memory.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.665
I'm his mother.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.044
LUCY:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:45.213
Um, working on some algorithms.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.340
{\an6}Have you heard anything
about Ethan yet?
Damn it, Lucy,

32:47.423 --> 32:48.383
I'm trying to concentrate.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.009
Just go do something, okay?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.053
Another field test
or go print a dress or...

32:52.136 --> 32:53.721
Are you mad at me?

32:54.972 --> 32:56.432
No, I'm...

32:56.516 --> 32:57.892
I'm mad at myself.

32:57.975 --> 32:59.268
Julie's not talking to me.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.270
Julie will get over it.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.064
Don't you get it?
She could lose Ethan.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.232
We could lose Ethan.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.693
{\an1}I care about losing Ethan,
too, Charlie.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.403
That's my brother.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.030
I know.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.657
{\an4}I'm sorry.
Maybe we should
go get some food?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.659
Get your mind off things?

33:14.742 --> 33:16.077
{\an3}No, I can't take
you out of the lab.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.912
{\an3}There's new protocols
after last week.

33:17.995 --> 33:19.539
Okay, I'm not saying
we go on safari.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.915
Just up the street.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.918
Julie says I need more
real world experience.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.086
Besides...

33:25.169 --> 33:27.255
you're not really

33:27.338 --> 33:29.340
{\an1}getting anything done here,
anyway.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.262
Okay, you see that dot?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.097
That's John Woods' car,

33:36.180 --> 33:38.433
{\an3}and it's loaded with state-
of-the-art, self-driving tech.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.310
{\an1}He goes to the Humanichs lab
at Yasumoto Tower.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.104
He leaves Humanichs

33:43.187 --> 33:44.313
an hour later.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.108
{\an1}His car stops
on the train tracks.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.986
Guy works at the most advanced
robotics lab in the world,

33:50.069 --> 33:52.280
{\an1}leaves, gets in his car,
car malfunctions

33:52.363 --> 33:54.574
in the middle of train tracks.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.617
Boom.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.453
Car is obliterated.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.621
{\an1}You talk to the manufacturer?
They chalked it up

34:00.705 --> 34:01.748
to user error.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.083
Of course they did.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.086
All right, was there
any incoming or outgoing calls

34:07.170 --> 34:08.588
from Humanichs after John left?

34:08.670 --> 34:11.215
Funny you should ask.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.342
{\an1}I hacked into the closest
cell tower records.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.762
Outgoing call

34:15.844 --> 34:16.763
two minutes after he left.

34:16.846 --> 34:17.972
From who?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.849
A Ms. Julie Gelineau.

34:19.931 --> 34:22.143
Going where?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.187
An encrypted number.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.938
Top levels of government
security clearance.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.149
We're talking SCI,

34:28.232 --> 34:29.775
executive branch.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.277
So John leaves Humanichs.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.989
Julie what's-her-face
makes a call,

34:35.072 --> 34:38.367
and ten minutes later
John is dead.

34:38.451 --> 34:41.286
Hey, that's on the house.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.208
(phone rings)

34:50.463 --> 34:51.672
You don't want that.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.382
The coffee.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.259
{\an6}Oh.
Worse than what
they make you drink

34:55.342 --> 34:56.469
in space.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.471
Okay.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.515
How'd it go?

35:00.598 --> 35:01.974
Still going.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.184
Listen, why don't you let me

35:03.267 --> 35:04.393
take you to dinner?

35:06.437 --> 35:07.605
What happened last night...

35:07.688 --> 35:09.857
It was a mistake, Toby.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.859
{\an1}And I don't know
what-what happened,

35:11.943 --> 35:14.320
but...

35:14.403 --> 35:16.030
I'm sorry.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.157
No.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.700
I understand.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.828
(sighs)

35:26.415 --> 35:27.542
LUCY:
<i>Do they know?</i>

35:27.625 --> 35:29.293
You haven't put
the limiters on me yet?

35:30.586 --> 35:32.713
Lucy, I put this off
as long as I can.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.841
At some point,
Julie's gonna figure this out.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.384
I don't have a choice.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.927
What about John's wishes?

35:38.010 --> 35:40.888
John's not here anymore.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.516
{\an1}You know free will makes me
a better soldier.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.101
Charlie, isn't that
what you want?

35:45.184 --> 35:47.061
I have many bosses.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.437
{\an3}As do you.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.982
{\an3}You're gonna learn
that in time.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.705
Lucy, where are you...

36:05.788 --> 36:08.499
{\an3}Lucy!

36:08.583 --> 36:09.959
Can I get a check, please?

36:20.177 --> 36:22.388
(beeping)

36:27.184 --> 36:28.436
(screaming)

36:40.907 --> 36:43.826
(children cheering)

36:49.165 --> 36:50.625
{\an1}WOMAN:
Tobias Shepherd.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.877
As I live and breathe,
I did not think you were gonna

36:52.960 --> 36:54.170
make it, dear brother.

36:54.253 --> 36:55.671
{\an1}Well, you know how much
I love balloons.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.131
Where's your better half?

36:57.214 --> 36:59.133
Shayna, uh,
she couldn't make it.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.343
I'm sorry.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.511
Yeah, okay. Fill me in later.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.804
{\an6}Sure.
GIRL:
Uncle Toby!

37:03.888 --> 37:05.973
Hey, come here!

37:06.057 --> 37:06.974
{\an1}(laughs)

37:07.058 --> 37:07.975
How's my best girl?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.810
{\an1}Huh? Hey.

37:09.894 --> 37:10.978
How old are you today?

37:11.062 --> 37:11.938
Seven.

37:12.021 --> 37:12.939
What, 17?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.857
No, seven.

37:14.941 --> 37:15.983
All right, 27.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.276
{\an1}(chuckles)

37:22.657 --> 37:24.659
You okay?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.953
Always.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.663
Look, I can't stay.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.498
I just wanted to drop that off.

37:30.581 --> 37:33.626
Of course.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.172
You know, I do what I do, Nicky,

37:38.255 --> 37:41.133
so kids can have
birthday parties.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.303
I know.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.307
Ethan may not be a person

37:48.391 --> 37:50.351
under the eyes of the law,

37:50.434 --> 37:52.895
but it is clear
that he is more than property.

37:52.979 --> 37:56.816
He is a thinking
and feeling being,

37:56.899 --> 37:59.318
and as such,
I feel he should be accorded

37:59.402 --> 38:03.030
the same treatment as thinking
and feeling beings.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.033
Under the law,
the best interests of the child

38:06.117 --> 38:08.703
{\an3}would determine the
outcome of such a hearing.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.372
And in my estimation,

38:11.455 --> 38:14.041
it is in Ethan's best interest
to be allowed

38:14.125 --> 38:16.043
to spend time with Dr. Woods.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.546
To reform those bonds

38:18.629 --> 38:21.340
and ultimately for her

38:21.424 --> 38:23.092
to regain custody of Ethan.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.848
Madam Secretary, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.017
We have an urgent situation.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.852
Excuse me, ladies.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.938
The schedule of all this to be
hammered out in short order.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.985
(sighs)

38:42.486 --> 38:44.905
"Best interests
of the child."

38:44.989 --> 38:46.907
Look at yourself, Molly.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.368
Are you even capable
of taking care of a child?

39:02.173 --> 39:04.133
You wanted to see me?

39:04.216 --> 39:05.926
Yeah.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.429
Shut the door.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.394
(sighs)

39:15.478 --> 39:16.771
Privacy mode.

39:16.854 --> 39:17.897
Something's happened.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.231
{\an1}Yeah.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.317
Look.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.445
You were right.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.113
I made promises to you.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.281
Toby, we don't have
to do this right now.

39:27.364 --> 39:29.033
{\an1}We do.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.785
'Cause I care about you.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.828
But I can't give you

39:32.912 --> 39:34.622
the things you need.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.957
The things you deserve.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.588
Oh.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.673
I'm not built for it.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.469
So if we call it off now,

39:48.552 --> 39:50.429
we'll save each other
a lot of pain.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.348
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

39:52.431 --> 39:53.641
{\an3}AIDE:
Sir, ma'am,

39:53.724 --> 39:55.643
I'm sorry to interrupt.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.437
They need you both
on the floor right now.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.830
Hi.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.582
Hi.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.459
Am I going home now?

40:24.213 --> 40:25.881
Eventually.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.135
I meant to Julie's.

40:32.429 --> 40:33.889
Ethan,

40:33.973 --> 40:37.309
you and I are gonna be spending
some time together.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.978
I don't want
to be reprogrammed again.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.062
And you don't have to be.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.314
{\an1}We don't need
those old memories.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.692
Because...

40:44.775 --> 40:46.193
we can make new ones.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.987
What about Lucy?

40:48.070 --> 40:49.572
Lucy?

40:49.655 --> 40:50.573
{\an3}My sister.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.116
She's a soldier.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.786
What kind of soldier?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.086
Julie,

41:04.170 --> 41:05.546
congratulations.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.339
{\an1}The most incredible thing
has happened.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.719
{\an1}Can I have
your attention, please?

41:11.802 --> 41:13.053
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:13.137 --> 41:15.890
at 2:18 p.m.,

41:15.973 --> 41:17.808
our Humanich, Lucy,

41:17.892 --> 41:19.768
made her first confirmed

41:19.852 --> 41:21.478
hybrid kill.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.925
(laughs):
Hey.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.760
You remember me?

41:54.678 --> 41:56.388
{\an1}You must be mistaking me
for somebody else.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.431
Are you kidding me?

41:57.514 --> 41:58.849
I could never forget you.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.809
Or that bathroom stall.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.774
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm meeting somebody.

42:06.857 --> 42:07.608
So if you don't mind.
Wait a minute.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.153
What if I do mind?
Don't touch me!

42:16.492 --> 42:18.494
Mom?

42:19.912 --> 42:21.914
Wait, wait a minute, is that...?

42:21.997 --> 42:23.457
I don't unders...

42:23.540 --> 42:24.792
Is that really you?

42:24.875 --> 42:26.252
I thought you were dead.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.544
Mom, wait a minute.

42:27.628 --> 42:28.796
{\an3}Come back.
Mom!

42:28.879 --> 42:30.798
(tires squealing)

42:37.721 --> 42:39.598
What the hell, Molly?

42:41.058 --> 42:43.727
Who did that?
I think I did.
