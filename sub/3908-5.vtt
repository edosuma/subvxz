This filth hurt your woman.

00:04.476 --> 00:05.795
Tell me.

00:05.799 --> 00:07.584
We know this guy.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.995
You want to be police?
Why don't y'all find my sister?

00:12.643 --> 00:16.455
The reputation of this clinic rests
on its discretion, officers.

00:16.490 --> 00:17.898
Your patient was murdered.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.864
Pitlor?
He was around for a time--

00:19.899 --> 00:21.861
part of Chessani's lodge,
I think.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.050
- That's Pitlor.
- Some coincidence.

00:24.085 --> 00:25.324
I'm pregnant.

00:26.871 --> 00:29.205
This is the best thing
it could happen.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.619
Just like that,
you're back here--

00:30.681 --> 00:33.299
Am I somehow giving you the impression
I've got a choice?

00:33.583 --> 00:36.155
Congratulations.
We're club owners again.

00:36.190 --> 00:39.071
I wanted to give you this.
Remember me with.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.238
Are you going away?

00:41.068 --> 00:42.928
Ledo Amarilla.

00:42.963 --> 00:46.780
Our job now is to locate and arrest
on the charges or murder.

who used the conference to announce
his candidacy for governor.

03:14.248 --> 03:17.950
Benjamin Caspere was
a corrupt individual

Security, hmm?

Frank Semyon.

04:34.145 --> 04:35.778
Stick with what you know.

04:35.813 --> 04:38.948
You didn't have to quit.
I told you that.

04:38.983 --> 04:42.318
None of that went down right.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.787
State came in.

04:44.822 --> 04:46.789
Better to walk
before they make you run.

04:46.824 --> 04:48.908
We'd have helped you with that.

04:48.910 --> 04:50.876
Geldof closed the case.
You're clear.

04:50.912 --> 04:53.245
He's saying the
Mexicans did Caspere?

04:53.298 --> 04:55.548
( sighs )

04:55.583 --> 04:58.551
Anybody come to you
asking about that?

04:58.586 --> 05:00.219
Caspere, the Mexicans?

05:00.254 --> 05:03.389
You and Teague, he talk to you much
when you were working together?

05:03.424 --> 05:05.424
What did you come
here for, Lieutenant?

05:05.476 --> 05:07.977
Learned some things
about Dixon.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.261
Wondered if you knew anything.

05:09.263 --> 05:11.731
Anything about what things?

05:11.766 --> 05:15.518
He had a lot of photographs,
some other stuff.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.270
Might've been into some people.

05:23.277 --> 05:25.361
( exhales )

05:25.413 --> 05:27.530
Bought another Charger.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.198
Yeah.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.785
I appreciate a good rut.

05:32.837 --> 05:35.671
Well, I gotta tell you--
sorry about this--

05:35.707 --> 05:37.757
but these row houses

05:37.792 --> 05:40.376
are reserved
for municipal employees.

05:40.428 --> 05:43.295
And now that you're not one...

05:43.297 --> 05:45.181
You fucking evicting me?

05:45.216 --> 05:47.516
Hey, I got them
to give you 60 days.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.602
And I wanted to come
tell you myself.

05:49.637 --> 05:50.886
Come on, Ray,

05:50.938 --> 05:53.522
you don't want
to live here anymore.

06:00.064 --> 06:01.864
I gotta go to work.

06:01.899 --> 06:03.315
Sure.

06:18.082 --> 06:19.882
( in Spanish )
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:35.683 --> 06:37.349
This is short 200.

06:37.351 --> 06:41.559
I told you about this.
What do I tell Mr. Frank?

06:45.243 --> 06:47.670
He can buy beer,
he can pay the rent.

06:54.502 --> 06:57.870
Tell him to have it tomorrow
or I'll put you on an ICE bus.

06:57.922 --> 07:00.039
( in Spanish )
<i>Immigration, do you understand?</i>

07:00.041 --> 07:02.041
Okay.

07:03.094 --> 07:04.760
<i>( door closes )</i>

07:07.215 --> 07:09.465
Jesus Christ.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.887
Sexual harassment's
a political tool.

07:14.889 --> 07:17.223
You pay a compliment,
a chick lawyers up.

07:17.275 --> 07:19.308
That shit's about looks, too.

07:19.393 --> 07:22.144
Difference between something like
what I'm here for and flirting

07:22.196 --> 07:23.479
is how good-looking
a dude is.

07:23.531 --> 07:25.114
( scoffs )
How's that fucking fair?

07:25.149 --> 07:28.734
Now, this reflex to project
blame upon the victim

07:28.786 --> 07:32.705
is going against the sorts of
habits we want to encourage.

07:32.740 --> 07:36.876
Detective Bezzerides, how do
you feel about your actions?

07:36.911 --> 07:40.629
Can I just ask, what the
fuck are you doing here?

07:40.665 --> 07:42.214
( laughs )

07:42.250 --> 07:44.300
Who wouldn't want her sexually
harassing you? Am I right?

07:44.335 --> 07:46.418
See, that kind of thing there

07:46.471 --> 07:48.804
could be considered
inappropriate.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.006
What?
It was a compliment.

07:51.058 --> 07:53.476
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.

07:53.511 --> 07:56.479
I understand.

07:56.514 --> 07:58.931
But I don't know.

08:00.318 --> 08:01.517
I mean, what can I say?

08:01.569 --> 08:03.936
I...

08:03.988 --> 08:07.740
just really like big dicks.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.993
Yeah.

08:11.028 --> 08:12.661
It's not just length.

08:12.697 --> 08:16.248
Everybody's always
talking length, but-- it's fine.

08:17.451 --> 08:20.536
I mean, girth, too.

08:20.588 --> 08:24.423
I really want to have trouble
handcuffing the thing, like.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.876
Um, I'm not sure--

08:26.928 --> 08:29.295
you know,
that might be taken--

08:29.297 --> 08:31.263
What?

08:31.299 --> 08:33.299
I thought you wanted
me to share.

08:33.351 --> 08:35.885
This is a safe circle, right?

08:35.937 --> 08:37.886
- Hell, yes, it is.
- Hey, let her share, man.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.554
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- <i> Yeah.</i>

08:42.727 --> 08:45.611
Union rep: <i>This man just received
a commendation for bravery</i>

08:45.646 --> 08:47.897
<i>for one of the worst firefights
in LA County history.</i>

08:47.949 --> 08:51.534
I don't think anyone would argue
Mr. Woodrugh's facility for killing.

08:51.569 --> 08:52.488
All right, damn it--

08:52.489 --> 08:54.846
We're amenable to putting
this entire matter behind us.

08:54.906 --> 08:58.157
I just want to forget that this
terrible thing ever happened

08:58.209 --> 09:00.125
and get on with
getting my life back.

09:00.161 --> 09:03.963
I did not do anything.

09:03.998 --> 09:06.131
And I am innocent.

09:06.167 --> 09:09.251
Black Mountain.
Pandhar village.

09:09.303 --> 09:12.171
I wasn't there.

09:12.173 --> 09:13.839
I wasn't at Pandhar.

09:13.925 --> 09:15.925
How many men did you kill then?

09:15.977 --> 09:18.677
How many at Vinci?

09:18.679 --> 09:22.514
Gillett: <i> We want any violation
involving this incident dropped.</i>

09:22.516 --> 09:26.518
And we want Miss Lindel's earlier
probation violation expunged.

09:26.571 --> 09:28.687
That was your publicist, right?

09:28.689 --> 09:31.941
Got the tabloids
to try smearing him?

09:31.993 --> 09:35.027
And now you feel okay
about dropping the allegation?

09:35.079 --> 09:37.696
I've learned a lot in therapy.

09:37.698 --> 09:39.365
I'm listening
to my higher power.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.367
I saved lives in Vinci.

09:41.369 --> 09:43.869
Oh, and did they fully account

09:43.871 --> 09:46.288
for whose bullets
killed those civilians?

09:46.340 --> 09:49.258
Yeah, they did.

09:49.293 --> 09:52.595
I just don't want what happened
to me to happen to anybody else.

09:52.630 --> 09:55.598
Detective Woodrugh works
insurance fraud now.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.933
So you got him off the street.

09:57.969 --> 09:59.518
Congratulations.

09:59.553 --> 10:01.770
Brooks:
<i>Are we still talking?</i>

10:01.806 --> 10:03.889
<i>You're going for the
deal, so take it.</i>

10:03.941 --> 10:05.524
She is a fucking liar.

10:05.559 --> 10:08.310
Brooks: <i>I think we're past
all the name-calling.</i>

10:08.362 --> 10:12.481
<i>We could still pursue</i>
<i>a civil case, Mr. Woodrugh.</i>

10:12.533 --> 10:15.818
Detective Woodrugh.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.038
Rate's changed.

10:19.073 --> 10:21.573
I need you to offer me
an old-times'-sake price.

10:21.575 --> 10:24.243
Frank, man, this economy?

10:24.295 --> 10:26.128
Start me a tab, Lloyd.

10:33.304 --> 10:34.887
Frank Semyon?

10:35.806 --> 10:37.556
Who are you?

10:37.591 --> 10:40.759
Our name is Gonzales.
We work here.

10:44.398 --> 10:46.231
How's that, friend?

10:46.267 --> 10:48.984
We had an arrangement
with Santos.

10:50.604 --> 10:52.938
Nobody's seen him.

10:52.990 --> 10:54.606
Long time now.

10:54.659 --> 10:57.359
We heard.

10:57.411 --> 10:59.445
So it is time to ratify
our arrangement.

11:04.752 --> 11:06.368
We never had one.

11:09.123 --> 11:11.090
And I don't need partners.

11:14.378 --> 11:16.545
Door's in
the same place, amigo.

11:26.807 --> 11:28.640
Can I help you, Cisco Kid?

11:34.148 --> 11:36.281
<i>( door opens )</i>

11:44.208 --> 11:46.542
The fuck?

11:46.577 --> 11:48.994
Frank, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

11:48.996 --> 11:51.213
Ship seems a little
loose today.

11:52.666 --> 11:55.134
Micro naps, Frank.

11:55.169 --> 11:56.969
Michelangelo took 'em.

11:58.222 --> 12:00.305
You remember Archeron
Waste Management?

12:00.341 --> 12:01.840
You sold it off.

12:01.892 --> 12:05.177
After we sprinkled that corridor
valley with heavy metals.

12:05.179 --> 12:06.812
So?

12:06.847 --> 12:09.815
So it's closed.

12:09.850 --> 12:12.851
The guy I sold it to,
Ali Komunyakaa,

12:12.853 --> 12:15.437
who I never saw finish a beer,

12:15.489 --> 12:19.191
gets drunk and drives
off a hillside in Ventura.

12:19.243 --> 12:22.795
All of a sudden.

12:22.831 --> 12:25.871
Not everyone has our
physical fortitude, Frank.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.352
Like Caspere.

12:29.388 --> 12:31.921
Ben was king fuck
of pad pulling.

12:31.923 --> 12:34.007
You deal with pimps,

12:34.059 --> 12:36.926
you get pimpish results, Frank.

12:38.647 --> 12:40.847
Couple months back,

12:40.899 --> 12:44.601
you said that there were outside
interests looking at the poker room.

12:45.854 --> 12:47.437
Who?

12:47.439 --> 12:49.439
Foreign interests.

12:51.326 --> 12:54.110
Some fuck.
I don't remember.

12:54.112 --> 12:57.614
I haven't been in touch since.

12:57.616 --> 12:59.782
Your boy hasn't
moved to Oakland.

12:59.784 --> 13:01.034
I've noticed.

13:01.086 --> 13:03.036
No.

13:03.088 --> 13:05.121
But you moved to Glendale.

13:05.123 --> 13:06.623
Shame, that.

13:06.675 --> 13:08.458
Mm-hmm.

13:09.461 --> 13:10.627
And your kid Tony.

13:10.679 --> 13:14.297
My family ain't
your concern, boychik.

13:14.349 --> 13:17.433
You've been running girls
through the poker room.

13:17.469 --> 13:20.303
<i>Not so much</i>
<i>as a heads up to me.</i>

13:22.390 --> 13:25.525
Penance is an extra
five a month.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.027
Get out of my office, Frank.

13:28.063 --> 13:30.280
Next time, wait
for an invitation.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.950
I'll let you get back
to your process, then,

13:33.985 --> 13:35.818
Michelangelo.

13:37.539 --> 13:40.123
Mr. Semyon.

13:40.158 --> 13:43.376
You don't direct me,
Khe Sanh motherfucker.

13:43.377 --> 13:44.866
I'm Chinese.

13:44.901 --> 13:47.630
Ben, go stand in front
of the fucking tank.

13:47.666 --> 13:49.799
Mr. Velcoro
was a person of interest

13:49.834 --> 13:51.668
in a state investigation
into corruption.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.169
Harris:
<i>Which yielded nothing.</i>

13:53.171 --> 13:55.421
And after the firefight
in Vinci, he resigned

13:55.473 --> 13:57.757
<i>under scrutiny and pending</i>
<i>a charge on substance abuse.</i>

13:57.842 --> 13:59.475
Harris:
<i>That's anecdotal hearsay.</i>

13:59.511 --> 14:02.512
There's no record of my client
being reprimanded for drug use.

14:02.514 --> 14:04.709
Would you submit
to a blood test, Mr. Velcoro?

14:04.710 --> 14:06.279
Absolutely, Your Honor.

14:06.314 --> 14:07.233
Finally, Your Honor,

14:07.269 --> 14:09.736
we are contesting
Mr. Velcoro's paternity

14:09.771 --> 14:12.605
<i>and wish to establish whether he
even qualifies for father's rights.</i>

14:12.657 --> 14:14.407
Harris: <i> - Objection.</i>
- Fucking assholes.

14:14.442 --> 14:15.942
Judge: <i>You're not helping
your case, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

14:15.994 --> 14:17.110
<i>Mrs. Brune was the victim</i>
<i>of an assault</i>

14:17.162 --> 14:18.778
<i>during the period</i>
<i>of conception.</i>

14:18.830 --> 14:21.614
<i>She believes the rapist to be the
biological father of her child.</i>

14:21.666 --> 14:24.617
I raised that boy.
Am raising him.

14:24.669 --> 14:26.419
It doesn't matter
where he comes--

14:26.454 --> 14:28.204
Our position is that
it matters a great deal.

14:31.042 --> 14:32.292
I trusted you.

14:32.344 --> 14:34.427
- I trusted <i> you.</i>
- What does that mean?

14:34.462 --> 14:37.463
I'll instruct the parties to refrain
from addressing one another.

14:37.515 --> 14:39.098
Period.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.851
<i>Now, I'm going to order a
paternity and toxicology test.</i>

14:41.886 --> 14:43.353
<i>I'm ordering</i>
<i>supervised visitation</i>

14:43.388 --> 14:46.389
<i>until both the paternity and
toxicology results are in.</i>

14:46.391 --> 14:49.058
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

14:49.110 --> 14:51.227
What, I gotta get a stranger
to chaperone me and my son?

14:51.229 --> 14:54.447
Judge: <i>I've delivered my verdict.
Don't push me, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

14:54.482 --> 14:57.734
Any revision at this point
would not be in your favor.

15:14.135 --> 15:16.836
She never looked at me
like that before.

15:16.888 --> 15:18.805
Like she hated me.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.473
You really gonna test clean?

15:20.508 --> 15:22.175
Yeah.

15:22.227 --> 15:24.594
Yeah, 60 days now.

15:24.596 --> 15:28.064
I want to fight this
however I can.

15:28.099 --> 15:30.350
Then pull some more
cash together.

15:30.402 --> 15:33.269
Tax-free or not, this
is gonna get expensive.

15:42.330 --> 15:44.414
Frank:
<i>You need more money?</i>

15:45.533 --> 15:47.283
<i>I need more money.</i>

15:47.335 --> 15:49.285
We're war rationing.

15:49.337 --> 15:51.087
More work, then.

15:51.122 --> 15:54.123
I can, you know, do
double shifts at the Lux.

15:54.175 --> 15:55.958
This is for your kid?

15:56.010 --> 15:57.593
Mm-hmm.

15:57.629 --> 16:00.880
I might have a job for you.

16:00.932 --> 16:02.715
The guy who bought
the waste company

16:02.767 --> 16:05.218
we used in the corridor died.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.804
Place has been cleaned out.

16:07.806 --> 16:09.889
I'm gonna start listening
to the hot feeling

16:09.941 --> 16:12.692
I got in the back of my neck.

16:12.727 --> 16:14.143
I want you to tail Blake.

16:14.145 --> 16:16.362
<i>I want to know what his
life is outside of me.</i>

16:16.398 --> 16:18.698
I can do that.

16:20.568 --> 16:22.402
What's your feeling?

16:22.454 --> 16:24.153
Running girls?

16:25.240 --> 16:27.039
Am I in confession?

16:27.075 --> 16:28.908
No.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.461
Just, um, never
seemed like you.

16:31.496 --> 16:33.413
Maybe you're just not
very perceptive.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.717
Ask you something?

16:38.887 --> 16:42.054
You think those Mexes
really did Caspere?

16:44.259 --> 16:46.175
I don't know.

16:46.177 --> 16:49.595
It was bullshit
surveillance and...

16:50.932 --> 16:54.066
the crash pad was a
fucking meth factory.

17:02.327 --> 17:04.861
Caspere died

17:04.863 --> 17:08.030
with five million
of my dollars cash.

17:09.751 --> 17:12.367
Stan's killed.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.171
I'm squeezed out
of the rail corridor.

17:16.424 --> 17:18.708
The enemy won't
reveal itself, Raymond.

17:19.877 --> 17:23.045
Stymies my retribution.

17:23.047 --> 17:26.015
It's like, uh...

17:26.050 --> 17:28.885
blue balls in your heart.

17:31.723 --> 17:34.440
I'll see about
some shifts at the Lux.

17:34.476 --> 17:36.058
But follow Blake.

17:36.110 --> 17:38.611
He's gotten too smooth
for my peace of mind.

17:53.328 --> 17:56.579
Oh, Paulie.
Oh, no.

17:56.631 --> 17:59.048
I'm getting married.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.250
I love her.

18:11.513 --> 18:12.845
Her name is Emily.

18:12.897 --> 18:14.680
How pregnant is she?

18:14.732 --> 18:16.766
Almost four months.

18:18.152 --> 18:20.152
Mother of God.

18:24.409 --> 18:26.859
Of all the stupid...

18:29.113 --> 18:32.281
You're a good-looking
white man.

18:32.333 --> 18:35.284
And you want to get
in shoot-outs and...

18:35.286 --> 18:38.287
become somebody's husband.

18:38.289 --> 18:40.623
You could do anything you want.

18:42.093 --> 18:43.593
Okay.

18:47.131 --> 18:51.017
If I was a man,
I'd have had the world.

18:52.387 --> 18:54.470
Dumb bastard.

19:10.038 --> 19:12.288
No, no.

19:12.323 --> 19:14.156
No, no, no.

19:14.158 --> 19:16.125
No. Fuck.

19:17.495 --> 19:19.662
<i>( TV playing )</i>

19:21.633 --> 19:23.716
You took it.

19:23.751 --> 19:25.468
How the fuck could you?

19:25.503 --> 19:27.169
Took what, Paulie?

19:28.056 --> 19:29.672
You know what!

19:31.175 --> 19:32.675
The money!

19:32.727 --> 19:35.177
The money I brought back
from Afghanistan.

19:35.179 --> 19:38.180
20 fucking thousand
dollars, Cynthia.

19:38.182 --> 19:42.351
That bag?
Oh, Paulie.

19:42.353 --> 19:44.937
You've been back four years.

19:44.989 --> 19:46.739
I thought that was
something you left for me.

19:46.774 --> 19:50.576
Something I--
I hid for, what, you to find?

19:51.913 --> 19:53.863
That's my stake.

19:53.865 --> 19:55.448
I'm having a kid.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.416
Well, how would I know that?

19:58.369 --> 20:00.753
I fucking bled for that money.

20:00.788 --> 20:03.539
What did you do with it, slots?

20:03.541 --> 20:06.626
Now listen.

20:06.678 --> 20:08.844
You knew I was out of work.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.464
I had every reason
to expect a little help.

20:11.516 --> 20:13.132
I'm making a family.

20:13.184 --> 20:15.017
I know that don't mean shit
to somebody like you,

20:15.053 --> 20:16.886
but it fucking matters to me!

20:16.888 --> 20:21.107
Don't you fucking tell me
I don't care about family.

20:21.142 --> 20:23.142
I was a dancer,

20:23.194 --> 20:25.311
but I carried you.

20:25.363 --> 20:29.065
And I brought you up alone.

20:30.118 --> 20:32.284
You could have been
a scrape job.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.121
You wouldn't even know
whose it was.

20:38.493 --> 20:41.210
You ruined my career,

20:41.245 --> 20:44.580
you ungrateful asshole.

20:46.801 --> 20:49.418
I carried you for nine months

20:49.470 --> 20:52.922
and I've been
carrying you ever since

20:52.924 --> 20:54.974
with your weirdness.

20:56.427 --> 20:58.728
You're strange.

20:58.763 --> 21:01.897
All your good friends,
the boys.

21:03.234 --> 21:06.485
Yeah, I know about you, Paulie.

21:06.521 --> 21:08.320
Yeah, I know.

21:09.774 --> 21:12.608
You shut your fucking mouth.

21:12.610 --> 21:16.662
You fucking poisoned cooze.

21:22.036 --> 21:25.087
- ( crying ) Paul.
- <i> ( car door opens, closes )</i>

21:25.123 --> 21:28.124
- <i> ( engine starts )</i>
- Paulie?

21:28.126 --> 21:30.376
- Wait.
- <i> ( car departs )</i>

21:32.013 --> 21:36.432
I got this last week. The
police never found anything.

21:36.467 --> 21:39.385
And you-- you said
you'd look into it.

21:39.437 --> 21:42.438
She left this,
what, at a PO box?

21:42.473 --> 21:44.306
Attached to my old address.

21:44.358 --> 21:46.308
The bill took a while
to find us here.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.311
<i>When I paid it,</i>
<i>they gave me the contents.</i>

21:49.313 --> 21:51.397
You settling in okay?

21:58.406 --> 22:00.122
<i>What's it mean?</i>

22:00.158 --> 22:01.574
Looks like a party.

22:01.626 --> 22:03.459
Did you follow up
with Sheriff's?

22:03.494 --> 22:08.047
They got nothing.
I hear nothing.

22:08.082 --> 22:10.633
I didn't want
to hand this over.

22:10.668 --> 22:13.669
I thought--
when we talked,

22:13.671 --> 22:16.555
I thought I could trust you.

22:24.682 --> 22:26.732
Shit.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.953
Fuck me.

22:48.005 --> 22:49.505
Ain't you been warned
about that kind of talk?

22:58.883 --> 23:00.466
Sorry you're down here.

23:00.518 --> 23:04.220
And I know you don't believe it, but
I never put you under that bus.

23:04.222 --> 23:06.605
Sheriff already knew
about you and me.

23:06.641 --> 23:08.224
I took full responsibility.

23:08.226 --> 23:10.943
Yeah, sure.
You're a real prince.

23:10.978 --> 23:13.395
You'll be out of here
in a few months.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.117
Look, somebody was trying
to do you, girl.

23:18.152 --> 23:20.986
And if you had a few more friends, it
might have been harder to get done.

23:23.958 --> 23:26.242
Hey, hey.

23:26.244 --> 23:29.829
You remember that foreclosure
we served a couple months back?

23:29.881 --> 23:31.747
The missing girl, Vera.

23:31.749 --> 23:33.249
Yeah.

23:33.251 --> 23:35.968
You said you had looked into her
old roommate's phone records,

23:36.003 --> 23:38.420
found an address where
Vera last called from?

23:38.472 --> 23:41.724
Yeah, it was up north.

23:41.759 --> 23:44.093
Could you get me that?

23:44.145 --> 23:46.478
You're here now.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.016
Help me out with this
and I promise

23:51.068 --> 23:54.153
to do a fearless and
searching moral inventory.

23:54.188 --> 23:57.072
( scoffs )

23:57.108 --> 23:59.074
All right.

24:31.392 --> 24:33.058
Loyalty's important

24:33.110 --> 24:35.811
and usually painful.

24:35.813 --> 24:39.782
One day you might find
cause to ask yourself

24:39.817 --> 24:42.952
what the limit is to some
pain you're experiencing

24:42.987 --> 24:45.404
and...

24:45.456 --> 24:48.407
you'll find out
there is no limit at all.

24:49.493 --> 24:52.328
<i>Pain is inexhaustible.</i>

24:54.415 --> 24:56.832
It's only people
that get exhausted.

26:43.941 --> 26:45.407
- Tony, how are you?
- Osip.

26:45.443 --> 26:47.576
- ( kisses )
- Always a pleasure.

26:47.611 --> 26:49.945
Approval is most essential.

26:49.997 --> 26:51.997
Let me see.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.792
- <i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( laughing )

27:51.175 --> 27:52.808
These books are bullshit.

27:52.843 --> 27:56.145
Whatever they were actually making
here, I can't figure it out.

27:56.180 --> 27:59.181
<i>That's expected.</i>
<i>We can wipe that clear.</i>

28:00.267 --> 28:02.768
How about you?
How are you doing?

28:02.820 --> 28:05.020
Where is this Santos character?

28:05.022 --> 28:06.522
Used to own the place.

28:06.524 --> 28:08.740
Wherever he is,
he ain't coming back.

28:08.776 --> 28:11.610
This is backslide city, Frank.

28:11.662 --> 28:15.664
<i>I know what's going on out
there in the poker room now.</i>

28:15.699 --> 28:17.833
We're not just running some club.
Come on.

28:17.868 --> 28:22.588
What's happening now
is we are surviving.

28:23.591 --> 28:25.207
All right?
We are rebuilding.

28:25.209 --> 28:28.260
You were almost out of this
kind of thing when we met.

28:28.295 --> 28:30.512
It was like you had a design.

28:30.548 --> 28:34.383
That design does not work

28:34.385 --> 28:38.470
once someone has stolen
all of our money.

28:38.522 --> 28:42.024
The design does not work
when I am knee-deep in dirt.

28:42.059 --> 28:44.443
You don't bring a kid
into a situation like this.

28:44.478 --> 28:47.229
To what?
Where is this going?

28:47.281 --> 28:49.314
Excuse me?

28:49.366 --> 28:51.733
I thought this was a you
and me thing, first off.

28:51.785 --> 28:54.903
It is, but it has to be about
something more than this.

28:54.905 --> 28:56.488
God, Frank, I helped, I know,

28:56.540 --> 28:58.907
but I don't want to be some
fucking gangster's wife.

28:58.909 --> 29:01.543
You know that word bothers me.

29:01.579 --> 29:04.329
Because, me, I didn't
ask for this world.

29:04.381 --> 29:08.333
I took it as--
"gangster"?

29:09.803 --> 29:12.754
I was born drafted on the
wrong side of a class war.

29:12.806 --> 29:14.806
So fuck that gangster shit.

29:14.842 --> 29:18.143
You're a pimp now, Frank.
A dealer.

29:18.179 --> 29:19.978
I don't mix with those people.

29:20.014 --> 29:21.980
You know that.

29:22.016 --> 29:25.434
I'm trying to stay above water
long enough so that we can--

29:25.436 --> 29:28.770
those people, everything they
do, they would do anyway.

29:28.822 --> 29:31.773
Crime exists contingent
on human desire.

29:31.775 --> 29:33.825
These were the avenues left me.

29:33.861 --> 29:36.278
And what's the expiration
date for all this?

29:36.280 --> 29:37.613
Our child?

29:37.615 --> 29:39.414
Our child is part
of the design.

29:39.450 --> 29:41.617
And being legitimate
is part of the design.

29:41.669 --> 29:44.453
Right now it's on hold.
You love me?

29:45.456 --> 29:46.922
Then you're with me.

29:46.957 --> 29:50.175
And maybe...

29:50.211 --> 29:52.878
you love me
if you're not with me.

29:52.930 --> 29:55.964
I understand.

29:55.966 --> 29:58.133
But say so

29:58.135 --> 30:00.886
so we don't have to be
on these goddamn eggshells.

30:00.938 --> 30:03.689
Like I'm not me
and you're not you.

30:11.949 --> 30:13.899
I don't think
I can have kids, Frank.

30:13.951 --> 30:17.486
<i>I've been pretending that
it might not be that way.</i>

30:17.538 --> 30:19.705
<i>I thought maybe--</i>

30:19.740 --> 30:23.659
but I went to the doctor alone.

30:23.661 --> 30:25.661
<i>I had more than one.</i>

30:25.663 --> 30:27.963
I had more than
one operation, I mean.

30:27.998 --> 30:29.665
- I had three.
- Three?

30:29.667 --> 30:31.166
- The fuck are you--
- <i> In my 20s.</i>

30:31.218 --> 30:35.053
We don't think I can have one, a child.
I can't.

30:35.089 --> 30:37.422
You--
( scoffs )

30:37.474 --> 30:40.559
You.
But why now, huh?

30:40.594 --> 30:44.096
Maybe I'm less appealing
in current circumstances.

30:44.148 --> 30:47.015
Why not tell me this when
I'm on top of the world?

30:47.017 --> 30:49.351
Well, now I'm me.

30:49.403 --> 30:52.154
And you're you.

30:52.189 --> 30:55.357
And here we both are
out in the open.

30:55.359 --> 30:57.192
So who loves who?

31:06.920 --> 31:08.503
Irma:
<i>This chicken looks good.</i>

31:08.539 --> 31:10.789
<i>Did you use that recipe or...?</i>

31:10.841 --> 31:13.208
Emily: - I did, yeah.
- Carlotta's recipe?

31:13.260 --> 31:16.928
I did. I hope it comes out
as well as she makes it.

31:16.964 --> 31:18.714
- Here.
- Very nice.

31:18.716 --> 31:21.350
- Oh.
- Thank you.

31:21.385 --> 31:23.051
Thank you.

31:23.103 --> 31:26.305
You know, we were just saying
that it'd be a good idea

31:26.357 --> 31:29.024
for Mami to come stay with us
a while after the baby comes.

31:29.059 --> 31:31.943
Irma: <i>And the wedding?
Speed up, I say.</i>

31:31.979 --> 31:33.812
<i>You're doing it,</i>
<i>get on with it.</i>

31:33.864 --> 31:35.564
<i>And you're gonna want me here.</i>

31:35.566 --> 31:37.366
You have no idea
what you're in for.

31:37.401 --> 31:39.568
Long nights.
No sleep.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.403
Might get kind of cramped.

31:41.405 --> 31:44.489
<i>I'll take the sofa in the living room.
I don't complain.</i>

31:44.541 --> 31:48.410
An entire week on a boat, I'm four.
I don't complain.

31:48.412 --> 31:51.163
Down in the hull eight days.

31:51.215 --> 31:52.998
- Mama.
- What?

31:53.050 --> 31:54.966
Is he gonna arrest me?

31:55.002 --> 31:58.086
Thank Jesus they got you
off that motorcycle.

31:58.088 --> 32:01.256
Much better.
And you wear a suit now.

32:01.258 --> 32:03.258
He's very handsome.

Jordan:
A couple of months back.

32:14.605 --> 32:16.938
When I talked about adoption.

32:16.940 --> 32:18.106
Jordan, I don't want--

32:18.158 --> 32:20.942
I was thinking
about you as a kid,

32:20.994 --> 32:23.495
what it would have meant

32:23.530 --> 32:25.747
if somebody had
looked out for you.

32:25.783 --> 32:28.417
If somebody had
taken care of you.

32:28.452 --> 32:30.085
There's no bandwidth
for that right now.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.454
I'm with you, Frank.

32:32.506 --> 32:34.456
I love you.

32:34.508 --> 32:38.126
But I don't want to see you
lose who you've become.

32:38.178 --> 32:40.128
And I don't mean the money.

32:42.132 --> 32:44.433
And I want to thank you
for seeing me like that.

32:44.468 --> 32:47.302
It fucking tears me up the way
you're having to live now.

32:47.304 --> 32:49.438
My problem is with you
not coming to bed.

32:49.473 --> 32:53.725
With both of us being half
in the bag each night.

32:53.777 --> 32:55.894
I will find a way out.

32:55.946 --> 32:59.648
The adoption,
you were so definite.

32:59.700 --> 33:04.486
I think you were saying no
to the kid that you once were.

33:04.538 --> 33:07.489
You were saying he was
somebody else's problem.

33:17.251 --> 33:19.668
I'm going home.

33:22.723 --> 33:25.390
You should make
some time to join me.

over the past five years.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.633
How exactly it came
to be so cheap.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.475
I can't see that
being of any interest.

42:59.527 --> 43:04.480
A waste removal service poisons park and
farmland along the central valleys.

43:04.532 --> 43:06.866
A major California landowner

43:06.902 --> 43:09.652
<i>committed to real estate</i>
<i>development steps in.</i>

43:09.688 --> 43:11.821
You're reaching.

43:11.856 --> 43:15.875
Archeron Waste Management
is dissolved.

43:15.911 --> 43:19.545
The guy I sold it to
ran himself off the road.

43:19.581 --> 43:21.881
You know anything about that?

43:23.084 --> 43:25.134
There might still be
something for you.

43:25.170 --> 43:26.836
Why I called.

43:26.838 --> 43:29.339
Let me ask, have you
ever heard of Caspere

43:29.341 --> 43:33.810
possessing
a collection of films?

43:33.845 --> 43:36.062
Home movies.

43:36.097 --> 43:37.897
A hard drive full of them.

43:39.401 --> 43:42.151
If you're interested
in doing something for us...

43:43.688 --> 43:45.905
it could put you
back in the corridor.

43:49.494 --> 43:51.527
Somebody's got that hard drive.

43:51.579 --> 43:55.164
I know the police never found
it in either of his houses.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.866
What about the Mexicans?

43:56.868 --> 43:58.201
Did Caspere?

43:58.203 --> 43:59.502
I'm no detective,

43:59.537 --> 44:01.838
but it might be
a good place to start.

44:01.873 --> 44:04.207
If you believe they're
the ones that did it.

44:04.209 --> 44:06.459
( chuckles )

44:10.882 --> 44:13.383
Five parcels,

44:13.385 --> 44:15.218
gifted,

44:15.270 --> 44:17.353
I find that hard drive.

44:40.245 --> 44:41.744
<i>( door opens )</i>

44:43.999 --> 44:46.382
( door closes )

44:46.418 --> 44:48.418
Oh, yes, I remember you.

44:48.470 --> 44:51.721
Correct?
How can I help you?

44:51.756 --> 44:54.557
I'm here to help you, Doc.

44:54.592 --> 44:58.177
I'm here to help you keep all
that cosmetic work intact.

44:59.764 --> 45:01.981
I can't imagine we have
anything to talk about, sir.

45:02.017 --> 45:04.434
I fully cooperated
with you last we spoke.

45:04.436 --> 45:06.569
Well, maybe that's on me

45:06.604 --> 45:08.821
not asking the right questions.

45:12.777 --> 45:16.112
You and Chessani, girls,
human trafficking.

45:16.164 --> 45:18.031
You do their implants,
nose jobs.

45:18.083 --> 45:21.250
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

45:21.286 --> 45:22.869
I'm a psychiatrist.

45:22.921 --> 45:26.039
With a secondary concentration
in reconstructive surgery.

45:26.091 --> 45:27.957
You, Chessani, Caspere,

45:28.009 --> 45:30.426
you went back farther
than you made out.

45:31.713 --> 45:33.796
The girls, spill.

45:33.848 --> 45:37.050
Your compensatory
projection of menace

45:37.102 --> 45:38.968
is a guarantor of its lack.

45:38.970 --> 45:42.021
And it says something
about the depths

45:42.057 --> 45:44.140
of your misperceptions.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.477
( groans )

45:47.529 --> 45:49.479
( panting )

45:51.699 --> 45:53.866
( screams )

45:53.902 --> 45:56.035
( muffled screams )

46:01.993 --> 46:03.376
Kind of day I've had,

46:03.411 --> 46:06.496
seeing you pop a few stitches
might start to make up for it.

46:06.498 --> 46:09.465
<i>Pin-eyed motherfucker.</i>

46:09.501 --> 46:11.717
Hooker parties.

46:11.753 --> 46:15.138
What you'd call affluent men.

46:15.173 --> 46:16.839
Caspere attended.

46:18.343 --> 46:19.392
Go.

46:19.427 --> 46:22.595
I just--
I just do work on girls.

46:22.647 --> 46:24.347
Make eights into 10s.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.766
Make sure they have the proper
prescriptions, that's it.

46:26.818 --> 46:29.485
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

46:29.521 --> 46:31.771
( groaning )

46:34.609 --> 46:36.242
The parties are a safe place,

46:36.277 --> 46:37.860
a conclave
for men of influence.

46:37.862 --> 46:41.614
Talk motivations or I'll dig
into that face-lift and yank.

46:41.666 --> 46:44.000
( groans )

46:45.620 --> 46:49.088
Caspere concocted the idea of
the parties with Tony Chessani.

46:49.124 --> 46:52.041
<i>Tony's a pimp</i>
<i>with political ambition.</i>

46:52.093 --> 46:55.294
His father doesn't participate
in the gatherings.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.046
Tony's service
makes him friends

46:57.098 --> 46:59.265
with those men of affluence
you mentioned.

46:59.300 --> 47:02.218
Lays the groundwork for deals
that Caspere facilitated.

47:02.270 --> 47:03.436
What else?

47:03.471 --> 47:06.055
I th-- I think both men
used the occasions

47:06.107 --> 47:09.392
to compile potential blackmail
material on their guests.

47:09.394 --> 47:12.612
Rumored Ben had footage

47:12.647 --> 47:14.730
of various important people.

47:14.732 --> 47:16.065
<i>McCandless.</i>

47:16.117 --> 47:17.733
Who?

47:17.785 --> 47:19.652
He's the president of Santa
Clara Railroad Company.

47:19.704 --> 47:22.121
It's smaller now.
Called Catalast.

47:28.913 --> 47:30.963
You go back with the Chessanis.

47:33.585 --> 47:36.135
You put his first wife
in a mental hospital.

47:36.171 --> 47:38.921
Yeah, I did every--

47:38.923 --> 47:41.257
I did everything--

47:43.178 --> 47:45.728
I did everything
I could for Helene.

47:47.482 --> 47:49.398
Certain traditions
of the Chessani patriarchs

47:49.434 --> 47:52.185
she had a difficult time with.

47:52.237 --> 47:54.270
They are...

47:54.322 --> 47:58.274
you might say,
a highly inventive family.

48:03.948 --> 48:05.114
<i>( whimpers )</i>

48:05.116 --> 48:08.201
<i>( waves crashing )</i>

48:08.253 --> 48:11.671
Athena: Might be tough to
get back into that scene.

48:11.706 --> 48:14.957
Ani: But not
impossible, right?

48:14.959 --> 48:17.376
Look for the pieces
that are solid,

48:17.428 --> 48:18.628
that haven't been
hollowed out yet

48:18.680 --> 48:20.630
with, like, a smooth surface.

48:21.799 --> 48:24.350
Say you lost
your job, whatever.

48:24.385 --> 48:27.136
Just some story. You need
to work the next party.

48:27.138 --> 48:31.023
I don't-- I don't know if I can get
in touch with those girls.

48:31.059 --> 48:34.060
They weren't exactly stable.

48:34.112 --> 48:36.362
I'm getting
really good at this.

48:36.397 --> 48:37.947
Not like hers.

48:37.982 --> 48:41.150
If you can get a line
on an invite,

48:41.202 --> 48:43.569
I need to look into it.

48:43.621 --> 48:45.621
This girl's missing.

48:45.657 --> 48:47.323
There's other stuff.

48:47.325 --> 48:49.408
Something else?

48:49.460 --> 48:51.043
After that shooting?

48:51.079 --> 48:53.079
You haven't talked about it.

48:53.131 --> 48:56.332
Dad asks and says that
you won't call him back.

48:56.334 --> 48:58.501
I'm busy.
Work.

49:00.004 --> 49:03.673
I wondered why you were so
hot to hit the beach today.

49:05.176 --> 49:08.644
I tried weighing if it was
worth the price of a lecture.

49:10.765 --> 49:12.982
I'm not in a spot
to give those.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.769
Did I tell you
I got into CalArts?

49:16.821 --> 49:20.523
You--
that's great.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.024
Awesome.

49:22.076 --> 49:23.526
Thank you.

49:23.578 --> 49:26.329
- Congratulations. Jeez.
- Thanks.

49:27.832 --> 49:31.367
I should, uh--
I should buy you dinner.

49:33.538 --> 49:38.207
Maybe I can reach out to a couple
of the girls that I knew before.

49:40.211 --> 49:43.596
For the straight up purpose of
getting <i> me</i> into that party, okay?

49:43.631 --> 49:46.849
Aren't you supposed
to be behind a desk?

49:46.884 --> 49:49.435
I just started my vacation.

49:49.470 --> 49:52.271
Going anywhere special?

49:52.307 --> 49:54.390
Yep. Guerneville.

49:54.442 --> 49:56.025
You homesick?

49:56.060 --> 49:59.895
For a place you hate, you never
really got that far away.

50:19.751 --> 50:21.917
Man: <i>An excess of boron
produces the color.</i>

50:21.969 --> 50:24.420
<i>Now, most of your colored</i>
<i>diamonds are of low quality,</i>

50:24.472 --> 50:27.757
<i>but something like these</i>
<i>with such a rich hue,</i>

50:27.759 --> 50:29.759
it's just very rare.

50:29.761 --> 50:31.260
And the cut, octahedron,

50:31.262 --> 50:33.646
these must almost
certainly be stolen.

50:33.681 --> 50:35.264
I told the other
policeman the same.

50:36.818 --> 50:38.651
What other policeman?

50:38.686 --> 50:40.603
Oh, a few months back,
a detective came by

50:40.655 --> 50:42.321
with pictures
of identical diamonds.

50:42.357 --> 50:46.275
Wanted to know if anybody had come
around maybe trying to sell them.

50:46.277 --> 50:47.943
I told him I read
the pawn sheets regular

50:47.945 --> 50:49.445
and I haven't seen them listed.

50:49.447 --> 50:52.365
He tells me they don't want
the stolens on any sheets.

50:52.417 --> 50:55.201
So he gives me his card,

50:55.253 --> 50:56.952
says to let him know
if I hear anything.

50:57.004 --> 50:59.422
- You still have that card?
- Yeah.

51:02.043 --> 51:05.044
He was a portly man.
Smelled like bourbon.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.598
<i>Flatulent, too.</i>

51:09.634 --> 51:11.467
Hmm.

51:13.638 --> 51:17.840
Paul: <i>The thing is, when Dixon
came around about the diamonds,</i>

51:17.842 --> 51:21.094
it would have been before we
found the safety deposit box.

51:21.146 --> 51:23.646
So he knew about the diamonds
before we found them.

51:23.681 --> 51:26.315
And in which case, why not
put them on the hot sheets?

51:26.351 --> 51:29.152
My ex-partner
got this address

51:29.187 --> 51:31.521
where the missing girl
last called from.

51:32.607 --> 51:35.358
Spot was on Caspere's GPS, too.

51:36.361 --> 51:37.910
Mmm.

51:37.946 --> 51:40.413
Seems like a happening place.

51:42.667 --> 51:45.251
Used to be this commune here

51:45.286 --> 51:47.703
on the River Valley.

51:58.883 --> 52:00.850
Why did you say--

52:02.353 --> 52:04.637
so that man that you tracked
down, that was a lie?

52:04.689 --> 52:08.191
No, I--
I don't understand.

52:08.226 --> 52:10.560
They caught him weeks ago.

52:10.562 --> 52:13.146
Called me in.

52:13.198 --> 52:14.897
Richard came with me.

52:16.568 --> 52:18.117
He's a serial rapist.

52:18.153 --> 52:21.204
DNA matched the kit that
they took on me back then.

52:22.407 --> 52:24.207
Did you just make it up?

52:24.242 --> 52:26.742
What you said?

52:28.746 --> 52:31.414
I...

52:31.416 --> 52:33.549
Why?

52:33.585 --> 52:36.219
Why would you do that?

52:36.254 --> 52:38.087
So-- so, what?

52:38.139 --> 52:41.974
So you can make me think that you
were protecting me or something?

52:42.010 --> 52:44.427
It's--

52:44.479 --> 52:46.812
it's not--
it's not what I--

52:46.848 --> 52:49.765
That ruined everything, Ray.

52:50.902 --> 52:53.486
That ruined you.

52:53.521 --> 52:58.157
That's why I have to have
the paternity test.

52:59.777 --> 53:02.111
I have to know.

53:03.081 --> 53:05.948
I have to know so I can...

53:06.000 --> 53:07.833
put it all where
it's supposed to be.

53:07.869 --> 53:10.953
I don't want to live
this fantasy

53:10.955 --> 53:13.172
about Chad with you anymore.

53:14.175 --> 53:15.958
He should have the truth

53:16.010 --> 53:17.793
when he's ready.

53:17.845 --> 53:19.879
This--
( sighs )

53:19.931 --> 53:21.714
this fake story

53:21.766 --> 53:23.466
where we made
a family has to end.

53:32.860 --> 53:36.312
He set me up.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.980
Frank.

53:37.982 --> 53:40.700
I don't know
what that means, Ray.

53:46.574 --> 53:48.791
<i>( engine starts )</i>

53:55.083 --> 53:56.999
You serious?

53:57.051 --> 53:59.001
About the adoption?

54:00.171 --> 54:04.173
It meant something
to me, what you said.

54:07.895 --> 54:10.096
I want to thank you
for telling me that.

54:14.152 --> 54:17.069
We both could have used
different parents.

54:31.536 --> 54:34.537
Don't worry about kids now.

54:34.539 --> 54:36.956
This is between you and me.

54:56.027 --> 54:58.444
Seems like nobody's been home.

55:16.464 --> 55:17.830
Want to call local?

55:17.915 --> 55:19.548
<i>Get us in here?</i>

55:19.584 --> 55:22.418
<i>( birds cawing )</i>

55:31.763 --> 55:33.596
Now we're following birds.

55:33.598 --> 55:36.098
Carrion birds.

55:47.078 --> 55:50.112
<i>( cawing continues )</i>

55:50.164 --> 55:52.581
You smell that?

55:52.617 --> 55:54.667
What, bird shit?

56:03.261 --> 56:05.711
<i>( cawing continues )</i>

56:21.479 --> 56:23.312
( flies buzzing )

56:25.400 --> 56:27.817
( groans )

56:30.705 --> 56:32.621
It's arterial spray.

56:35.493 --> 56:37.209
Paul:
<i>Jesus.</i>

56:43.000 --> 56:45.668
- <i> ( clock ticking )</i>
- The ceiling's clean.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.336
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

56:47.338 --> 56:49.672
No water stains.

56:56.981 --> 56:59.231
I like it here.

57:00.685 --> 57:03.269
Really.

57:03.321 --> 57:06.071
We didn't need all that room.

57:06.107 --> 57:08.407
Don't talk like that.
Come on.

57:10.495 --> 57:14.163
There's a guy,
McCandless, Catalast...

57:14.198 --> 57:16.332
Leave business.

57:20.371 --> 57:22.838
We should sell the clubs.

57:22.874 --> 57:25.541
( exhales )

57:26.677 --> 57:29.011
Buy a farm.

57:29.046 --> 57:33.048
Grow organic produce.
( laughs )

57:33.050 --> 57:35.184
I could see us as farmers.

57:35.219 --> 57:37.102
Mmm.

57:37.138 --> 57:38.971
You would run for a plane

57:39.023 --> 57:40.890
the first time
you smelled shit.

57:40.942 --> 57:43.192
- ( laughs )
- Trust me.

57:45.313 --> 57:47.229
I worked as a picker.

57:49.066 --> 57:52.201
I was 14.

57:52.236 --> 57:53.986
15.

57:56.123 --> 57:57.957
You don't want
to grow anything.

58:16.761 --> 58:20.980
- What about this guy?
