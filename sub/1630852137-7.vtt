WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:06.960
The new year has just begun.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.400
The season gets
right into the swing of things.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.200
Chiesa!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.560
Coach Pirlo is really put to the test.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.760
The defeat against Porto in the first leg
shakes the team.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.000
But they react in the championship
thanks to Ronaldo's goals.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.720
Ronaldo! Juventus is ahead!

00:24.680 --> 00:27.400
Despite Chiesa's performance
in the second half,

00:27.480 --> 00:30.320
the Champions League elimination upsets

00:30.440 --> 00:31.840
the entire locker room.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.720
The dream has faded

00:33.840 --> 00:36.120
and the tenth consecutive Scudetto

00:36.320 --> 00:38.080
seems increasingly unattainable.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.400
Will Juventus manage to succeed?

00:47.200 --> 00:50.040
TURIN
MARCH 2021

00:51.120 --> 00:52.640
It's the beginning of spring,

00:52.920 --> 00:55.400
the championship will end in eight weeks.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.440
Being eliminated
from the Champions League still hurts,

01:00.600 --> 01:04.280
but for Fabio Paratici and Juventus,
a new challenge is already in sight.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.040
A coffee, please.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.120
I'm taking a piece of panettone.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.200
-We lost points, right?
-Yeah, I know.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.360
I always come here
because they're discreet.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.280
They're very professional.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.000
For the guys.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.680
For the guys, here. Thanks.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.080
-Bye, guys.
-Bye, Fabio. Have a good day.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.680
The hope to succeed
in Europe has vanished,

01:34.760 --> 01:37.120
but the Scudetto
is still an attainable goal.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.840
They must recover points from Inter,
but winning the Serie A, for Juventus,

01:42.920 --> 01:44.280
is almost a habit.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.840
They've won nine years in a row now.

01:46.920 --> 01:51.000
There's a group of people
that has been working for 11 years...

01:52.840 --> 01:56.720
...and is fully dedicated to Juventus
and to winning the title.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.720
This week...

01:59.840 --> 02:03.120
Captain Chiellini goes back
to training after an injury.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.640
By the thunderbolts of Zeus.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.600
His experience and grit as a player

02:09.840 --> 02:12.280
will be vital during the championship.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.760
Let's play the ball.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.080
To be Italian, you cannot just...

02:17.720 --> 02:19.720
You need to learn to be a liar.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.800
-You can't just dive.
-You can't just dive,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.160
bump, shout, you know...

02:27.800 --> 02:30.160
Winning trophies is amazing...

02:30.280 --> 02:31.600
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

02:31.680 --> 02:33.760
You never forget the first time.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.440
Remembering what it's like to win
gives you strength to overcome obstacles.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.160
Persistence is important

02:41.280 --> 02:43.760
because you have to set

02:44.360 --> 02:46.320
an example in all aspects.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.160
I believe that the right thing to do

02:53.280 --> 02:56.560
is really to give...

02:56.640 --> 02:58.160
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

02:58.240 --> 03:01.160
...our best in terms
of reliability and professionalism

03:01.240 --> 03:03.000
to finish the season well.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.440
Time should never be wasted,
that's for sure.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.360
Attack! There it goes.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.480
For over 90 years, Italian teams
have been fighting for the Scudetto.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.480
Juventus has won more
championships than Inter and Milan,

03:25.560 --> 03:27.840
triumphing for the last nine seasons.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.520
We must win again. It's important.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.560
Today, victory is back in Juventus' DNA.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.480
When you wear the Juventus' jersey,
what happens tomorrow

03:44.560 --> 03:46.080
isn't important.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.600
It only matters what happens today.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.480
It would mean
that Juventus' mentality is truly unique.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.760
Champions of Italy!

04:10.440 --> 04:13.640
In 24 hours, Juventus will face Benevento.

04:13.880 --> 04:18.480
Promoted from Serie B, the team has
only won one match since the year began,

04:18.640 --> 04:20.760
and it's now ranked 16th.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.360
Why don't you put him on the right?
Fede Chiesa.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.920
-No.
-So you're not playing with three.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.240
If there's only one striker, no.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.360
We thought that we would have

04:45.440 --> 04:47.240
still been in the Champions League.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.920
I didn't expect it, but it's part

04:50.360 --> 04:53.200
of the game, part of the job.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.520
You can put him here, and that makes
three of them. A rover and two forwards.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
Two left.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.320
Yes. One.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.560
-Then...
-Dragusin, out. Bonucci, rover.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.000
Then you take him out...

05:10.520 --> 05:13.320
and he becomes the rover.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.880
My approach to matches
and to these challenges has always been

05:19.080 --> 05:20.920
intense, so...

05:21.360 --> 05:27.040
no matter what I do, I always do it
with adrenaline and concentration.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.760
TURIN
MARCH 21, 2021

05:28.800 --> 05:31.880
At night you start thinking
about what can happen...

05:32.000 --> 05:35.080
You can't sleep very well,
your brain is always working.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.840
I'll be honest, the coach

05:39.960 --> 05:42.560
has enviable balance

05:42.680 --> 05:47.880
and he doesn't give away
any signs of stress, although...

05:48.480 --> 05:51.480
the reality is different. For certain,

05:51.720 --> 05:57.200
one of the reasons I stayed this year
was because he was here.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.680
Juventus must win
to continue competing for the Scudetto

06:02.760 --> 06:06.400
and get closer to the leader Inter,
which has a seven-point lead.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.760
Off we go. You're about to enjoy
Juventus-Benevento, the 28th match

06:14.840 --> 06:16.240
of the Serie A championship.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.960
Go, Fede. There it comes.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.680
Watch out, Ronaldo again
in the penalty area. Ronaldo!

06:22.080 --> 06:24.080
Great opportunity for Juventus.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.840
Come on!

06:26.120 --> 06:30.720
Watch out for Morata, he's on the move.
Morata, great action. Morata! Saved.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.800
Come on!

06:31.880 --> 06:34.720
Juventus was close to a 1-0 goal.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.200
Corner kick.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.160
Álvaro Morata, two opportunities.
A clear action for Juventus.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.840
A first for de Ligt and then Morata.
The ball doesn't want to get in.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.280
Spread out!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.280
Cristiano wants to shoot.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.760
Ronaldo's right kick!

07:02.040 --> 07:04.200
Montipò saves it one more time.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.160
Juventus tries

07:07.320 --> 07:11.400
to remain in the offensive zone,
but the two minutes of added time is over.

07:11.520 --> 07:16.320
It's halftime here at the Allianz Stadium.
Zero-zero for Juventus and Benevento.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.800
After a frustrating first half,
the result remains unchanged.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.240
Juventus can't tame Benevento.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.840
Forty-five minutes are all that's
left to save the season.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.120
We're crazy, you guys.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.600
If we want to win the Scudetto,
we can't play like this!

07:38.760 --> 07:42.840
When we have the ball,
we can't play like this!

07:42.920 --> 07:45.920
Like this we won't win shit!

07:46.040 --> 07:49.480
Fucking hell! We're all shit
if this is how we play!

07:49.560 --> 07:54.080
Don't you realize
how important it is to win this game?

07:54.320 --> 07:59.160
It's been a year! Always
someone else's fault, always next time!

07:59.320 --> 08:02.560
Bullshit! Let's take responsibility
and accept blame

08:02.640 --> 08:04.640
for this shitty game.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.280
I was pissed because

08:07.520 --> 08:09.360
I was aware

08:09.520 --> 08:12.960
that we weren't performing

08:13.080 --> 08:15.040
as well as we should have.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.880
He's right.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.520
I'm very

08:20.840 --> 08:24.360
instinctive and I trust my gut.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.920
I can't comfort you

08:28.160 --> 08:31.160
when you need a slap to wake you up.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.560
A shake, a...

08:34.720 --> 08:39.960
A wake-up call helps you a lot more.
And then maybe...

08:40.320 --> 08:42.960
it gives you an electroshock
that turns you back on.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.400
This is what I try to do
with the younger players. I try...

08:48.240 --> 08:50.200
to push them to give their best.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.040
If we play like this, we can't win.

08:53.200 --> 08:58.000
If we are not determined,
we can't win a match.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.160
We can be good with words,

09:00.240 --> 09:03.280
but we need facts on the field.
We're doing shit.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.120
We won't win with this attitude!

09:06.600 --> 09:09.600
We need to change our attitude,

09:09.640 --> 09:12.760
or we'll stay 10 points behind Inter
and they deserve to win.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.520
Come on, guys!

09:17.720 --> 09:22.520
We can do it! We just need determination
and guts to win these fucking games.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.480
Let's kick their ass in the second half.
Come on!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.720
Andrea Pirlo needs to try

09:40.840 --> 09:44.080
to bring in a very important victory

09:44.360 --> 09:46.200
to achieve the goal.

09:46.880 --> 09:47.760
Rabiot.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.240
Ronaldo. He wants to turn around.
He manages to do it.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.400
CR7, he goes for the dribble.
Clear foul against him. Free kick.

09:59.320 --> 10:05.320
Ronaldo opens for de Ligt in the middle.
He crosses. Nobody gets there.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.160
We're about to enter the last 20 minutes.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.640
Come closer, Cri. Come on, Cri.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.440
The ball's on the other side.
Gaich retrieves it.

10:18.520 --> 10:23.080
He aims for the goal. Gaich!
Goal. Benevento leads with Gaich

10:23.400 --> 10:25.160
on Juventus' mistake.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.520
The score changes.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.960
Come on, take the ball. Come on!

10:30.120 --> 10:31.840
Juventus, zero. Benevento, one.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.760
Leo! Twenty-five! Come on, Leo, 25!

10:37.240 --> 10:41.200
Come on, let's go!
Twenty-five minutes, come on!

10:41.320 --> 10:44.160
Today we have to win, guys. Come on!

10:44.360 --> 10:50.360
Arthur, good idea for Chiesa. He aims
for the goal. Chiesa. Is that a penalty?

10:51.200 --> 10:54.480
Not according to the referee.
It seemed like a clear foul to me.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.480
Penalty! What are you doing?

10:58.760 --> 11:00.560
What are you doing?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.960
Referee! It's a clear penalty.

11:03.120 --> 11:08.640
-Penalty! Penalty! Penalty!
-Penalty!

11:08.840 --> 11:10.520
Penalty!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.440
The referee doesn't award
a penalty to Juventus.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.720
Only one minute left
until the match is over.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.720
Kulusevski crosses in the middle,
looking for Ronaldo,

11:29.840 --> 11:33.560
Ronaldo, there he goes.
Ronaldo! Saved. It's not over.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
Montipò's net is haunted.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.560
I didn't think we could
lose at home to Benevento.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.760
I hope this will be the only home defeat
for Juventus against Benevento.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.640
This is a tough moment.
We've had many tough moments

12:01.880 --> 12:04.680
over my last 20 years with Juve.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.640
I was really hoping
to win a tenth Scudetto.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.760
I spent half of my career
as a champion of Italy

12:20.720 --> 12:24.920
and watching someone else
win the Scudetto will be strange.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.960
What did we do wrong?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.360
FEDERICO CHIESA
STRIKER

12:31.440 --> 12:32.840
I can't tell you,

12:32.920 --> 12:36.480
because I never won the Scudetto.
If in the future,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.200
I win

12:38.320 --> 12:41.120
the Scudetto, I'll tell you,

12:41.200 --> 12:42.840
"This year we missed this."

12:46.320 --> 12:48.520
Benevento is celebrating
in the locker room,

12:49.320 --> 12:52.720
while the coach and the managers
discuss the defeat.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.640
Why are they conceited today?
We're out of the Champions League.

12:57.880 --> 12:58.920
I know.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.480
We need to get in there
and kick their ass.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.000
I'm telling you.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.080
We're here because we're part of this.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.200
No, it's them. It's them.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.840
The game against Benevento

13:16.320 --> 13:18.640
will go down in history because...

13:19.000 --> 13:20.320
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

13:20.400 --> 13:23.600
...if you lose against Benevento
you can lose against all teams.

13:27.120 --> 13:32.040
After the defeat that destroyed
the hope of a tenth Scudetto,

13:32.560 --> 13:35.920
the pressure on Coach Pirlo
gets higher and higher.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.240
I believe Pirlo is no longer shining.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.840
RADIO 24
FROM MARCH 21, 2021

13:41.920 --> 13:44.440
After this defeat, there are no chances

13:44.760 --> 13:46.720
to make it to the championship game.

13:47.520 --> 13:53.520
And in the future, is Pirlo the right man
for a team that needs to be rebuilt?

13:53.920 --> 13:58.320
It's time to resolve doubts
about Pirlo's season.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.480
The outcome of the season is at risk

14:03.560 --> 14:06.120
and Pirlo seeks the company
of an old friend.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.280
So, I'm handling the pressure

14:08.520 --> 14:11.200
the same way I was doing it as a player.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.440
They can butcher me,
but I don't owe them anything.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.920
Well said. That's true.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.360
They were breaking my balls
if I was playing well or bad.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.640
It's the same for me.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.720
I never thought you'd become a coach.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.080
Me neither, at first.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.840
I took the training and little by little

14:28.040 --> 14:30.280
it started growing on me.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.520
-Thank you.
-Your cruda.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.280
The chef roasted the peppers
without bagna cauda.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.560
-Thank you! Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.680
What about next year, Gigi?

14:43.880 --> 14:47.240
At the end, the only reason

14:47.920 --> 14:51.080
why I'd quit,
is the lack of a strong energy.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.200
Pirlo and Buffon played together
in Juventus for four years,

14:55.320 --> 14:58.440
but their friendship started
in the national team 20 years ago

14:58.520 --> 15:01.360
and their bond
goes beyond the locker room.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.200
The world has changed.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.760
There's a different mentality,
with different needs. When we were younger

15:08.880 --> 15:12.720
playing soccer,
winning and training was our whole life.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.280
Not just for our team, but in general.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.080
-Now the priority is...
-The phone.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.440
The phone, the followers,
being silly on Facebook, on Instagram.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.600
One thing

15:25.080 --> 15:26.600
that I fucking hate

15:26.720 --> 15:31.440
is seeing people on their phone
right before the match.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.240
And instead, from next year,
before the game,

15:34.440 --> 15:37.840
you get your massage,
and you leave your phone in the locker.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.640
I think it's a good idea. I mean...

15:41.240 --> 15:43.240
So that you can focus.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.040
I think it's inevitable that

15:51.120 --> 15:54.000
with the generational turnover
we need to restore

15:54.080 --> 15:59.000
a certain balance
and certain strong points.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.000
-Here's the bill.
-Thank you.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.200
Is the bill on the coach?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.000
No.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.280
Times are changing rapidly
on and off the field

16:16.720 --> 16:20.000
and Juventus needs to attract younger fans

16:20.080 --> 16:22.760
through the use of social media
such as Twitch.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.160
It's a different world
for Pirlo and Buffon,

16:27.400 --> 16:30.560
but essential to keep up
with the new generations.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.320
Two, one, go.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.840
Twitch is the social media that connects
the club to the world of video games

16:42.960 --> 16:45.080
and live streaming entertainment

16:45.160 --> 16:48.880
thanks to its 25 million
daily global visitors.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.800
Globally, 40% of people between 16
and 24 years old don't even follow soccer.

16:53.960 --> 16:59.720
The passion we see in them is different
from that of previous generations.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.800
The world of esports
is definitely something that...

17:05.440 --> 17:08.120
...generates entertainment
and involves the masses.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.920
We need

17:10.000 --> 17:12.440
to observe

17:12.520 --> 17:16.880
with great attention the trends
that are developing in the industry.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.880
I think there's still a lot of room

17:21.320 --> 17:24.560
for soccer in esports.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.520
In comparison to traditional sports,

17:27.640 --> 17:29.760
we're still at an early stage.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.560
It's got some crazy potential, though.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.080
It's clear that the next five, six,

17:37.200 --> 17:41.160
10 years will be fundamental,
as we're experiencing...

17:41.240 --> 17:45.080
a great transformation for the sport
in terms of consumer habits

17:45.200 --> 17:51.200
and those who can connect with
this new audience, will succeed.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.880
The digital world is constantly evolving.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.000
The president had this vision

18:04.080 --> 18:07.680
and we are those
who transform it in reality.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.280
Juventus keeps up with the times

18:13.560 --> 18:19.160
and 18-year-old Andy Elonda
is a new generation fan.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.080
ANDY MANDA ELONDA
JUVENTUS FAN

18:25.160 --> 18:27.480
I have a passion for Juve,
so it's personal.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.200
If they lose, it's like I lose.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.800
If they win, it's like I win.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.200
In the neighborhood where I grew up
most kids supported Juve

18:36.680 --> 18:39.480
because kids always like to win.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.080
You see?

18:44.040 --> 18:49.000
Heart, passion and sweat
on the suburban fields.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.920
I'll be honest,
I can't live without soccer. I just can't.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.560
If they play like us, we'll win.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.080
TURIN
APRIL 3, 2021

19:12.160 --> 19:14.320
From the Olympic Stadium, Grande Torino,

19:14.440 --> 19:19.200
Juve wants to score points and Torino
is trying to escape the relegation zone.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.160
Bianconeri against Granata.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.520
The throne of the city is at stake.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.800
After losing to Benevento, Juve has
to qualify for the Champions League.

19:36.440 --> 19:40.720
Watch out, Chiesa. Chiesa. Chiesa. Chiesa!

19:41.160 --> 19:42.480
Yes!

19:46.680 --> 19:47.960
From the Allianz Stadium,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.080
TURIN
APRIL 7, 2021

19:49.200 --> 19:51.080
Juventus-Naples.

19:51.200 --> 19:56.200
Chiesa dribbles.
He crosses to the middle. Ronaldo!

19:56.440 --> 19:58.560
Juventus is ahead!

19:59.480 --> 20:03.720
Bentancur shoots.
There goes Dybala to score. Goal!

20:03.800 --> 20:07.520
Two goals for Juventus!
Paulo Dybala is back!

20:07.800 --> 20:10.800
From the Allianz Stadium, Juventus-Genoa.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.280
Watch out, the American, McKennie.
He aims for the goal. McKennie!

20:15.320 --> 20:18.320
Juventus scores a goal
with Weston McKennie.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.560
A series of victories seems
to consolidate Juve's position.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.760
BERGAMO
APRIL 18, 2021

20:23.800 --> 20:27.720
Ilicic for Malinovskyi.
Left-kick, deflection, goal.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.200
But the points lost with Atalanta

20:30.440 --> 20:32.040
push them down to fourth place

20:32.080 --> 20:33.680
with seven games to go.

20:34.080 --> 20:38.080
We must never give up,
for better or worse, until the end.

20:39.480 --> 20:44.400
Juventus arrives at Udine with Inter,
the new champions of Italy.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.920
Rabiot aims for the goal,
crosses in the middle for Ronaldo. Header!

20:49.080 --> 20:51.720
Goal! Juventus is leading!

20:51.800 --> 20:55.160
Cristiano Ronaldo. The game is over!

20:55.920 --> 20:59.280
Ronaldo's goal right before the end
of the match with Udinese

20:59.320 --> 21:03.320
keeps the hope alive in the fight
for the Champions League.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.160
While the team fights on the field,

21:13.240 --> 21:16.280
unexpected news shows that the president,

21:16.320 --> 21:19.640
Executive Chairman Andrea Agnelli
is looking to the future.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.440
There were rumors...

21:25.520 --> 21:29.080
...that in the evening
Florentino Pérez would have announced

21:29.160 --> 21:30.800
the creation of a Super League.

21:32.440 --> 21:36.200
I started texting, trying to understand.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.040
The silence

21:41.240 --> 21:47.240
from sources that would normally
give answers was suspicious.

21:51.280 --> 21:57.280
When there's no answer to your WhatsApp
messages and to your calls, you worry.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.640
Over the next 48 hours,
so many things happened.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.680
Good morning from TG3, it's chaos
in the world of international soccer

22:07.760 --> 22:10.200
after the creation of a Super League.

22:18.280 --> 22:23.120
Concurrently, Andrea Agnelli has resigned
from other positions in European soccer.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.840
We want an alternative
European competition

22:28.160 --> 22:31.560
that gives stability to clubs
and therefore to you.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.000
The project has a code name, BSW.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.040
which is what we want to
bring to the fans.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.040
I work on it.
If I need protection, bodyguards,

22:45.120 --> 22:48.280
I hope to have them behind me,
because for now I need them.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.160
But the history of soccer
has its own larger path.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.560
And this moment was inevitable.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.960
While many criticize the initiative,

22:57.040 --> 23:02.680
Agnelli considers it essential
to recover the losses due to the pandemic.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.640
Today, soccer clubs are companies.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.640
When you try to bring in innovation,
you often clash.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.080
Between 2019/20 and 2020/21 we estimate

23:13.280 --> 23:17.040
between 6.5 and 8.5 billion
in accumulated losses

23:17.320 --> 23:21.600
in the first division. So either
you owe because you have equity,

23:21.920 --> 23:24.680
or you need capital,
because what really matters

23:25.080 --> 23:26.760
is the present and the future.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.000
In the streets of Turin,
the news divides the fans.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.440
The Super League is only for rich people.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.360
It's mere business.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.320
I like that it includes
the biggest clubs in Europe

23:44.440 --> 23:50.080
and it's therefore comparable to the NBA,
which also collects the strongest teams.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.240
It kills the poetry, in my opinion.

23:54.360 --> 23:59.520
On the one hand it was
a source of pride to know that my team was

23:59.880 --> 24:01.440
among the best in Europe.

24:07.920 --> 24:13.040
The Super League collapses. UEFA says,
"Glad they admitted the mistake."

24:13.280 --> 24:16.320
Last night six English teams
were the first to leave

24:16.400 --> 24:19.320
the Super League
and this morning they were followed by

24:19.400 --> 24:21.080
Inter, Milan and Atletico Madrid.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
Now 48 hours after the announcement,

24:35.400 --> 24:37.880
the European Football Super League
is on hold.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.600
Many aspects will have to be explained

24:45.840 --> 24:50.040
in order to understand why

24:50.200 --> 24:54.240
twelve clubs,
which represented billions of fans,

24:54.600 --> 24:58.800
fell apart in less than 48 hours.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.960
Perhaps it should have been

25:01.200 --> 25:05.560
better prepared from the media point
of view. And the issues are still there.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.880
We'll see if this project will give life
to something else in the future.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.200
While the world is discussing
the Super League,

25:15.400 --> 25:19.920
Juve has to focus
on the home game against Milan.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.200
A deciding match.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
TURIN
MAY 9, 2021

25:24.360 --> 25:26.440
It's worth a lot to the leaderboard.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.880
Both teams are chasing a place
in the Champions League.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.160
Let's start strong.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.960
We need to be fierce and aggressive.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.880
Milan is a rival for a place
in the Champions League.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.600
Losing is not an option.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.840
It's definitely a decisive game for us

25:49.160 --> 25:53.400
as we only have four games left
till the end of the championship

25:53.560 --> 25:55.440
and we know it won't be easy,

25:55.640 --> 26:00.400
but we all want to play in the Champions
League, and we must aim to that.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.040
Off we go. Enjoy Juventus-Milan.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.840
Watch out for the cross in area.

26:19.960 --> 26:23.120
There goes the Colombian,
cross in the middle.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.000
Chiellini, header and ball out.

26:27.080 --> 26:31.360
Chiellini didn't take advantage of it.
The most important opportunity for Juve.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.840
Penalty for Milan.

26:46.720 --> 26:51.280
Çalhanoğlu. Cross in the middle
looking for Ibrahimovic.

26:51.560 --> 26:57.080
Szczęsny. Diaz! Goal!
Juventus, zero. Milan, one.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.800
It's halftime here at the stadium.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.640
Juventus, zero. Milan, one.
We'll be right back for the second half.

27:11.800 --> 27:16.320
All games are tough in modern soccer.
There is no such thing

27:16.560 --> 27:17.920
as an easy match today,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.880
so being at the top
of each game is difficult.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.320
We still have 45 minutes left.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.160
We need to give it all.
We have substitutions.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.640
Let's do all it takes to win.

27:29.720 --> 27:33.600
-Come on! We need to stay positive.
-Come on!

27:33.960 --> 27:37.280
We need to be confident, help each other.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.760
If we make a mistake,
then we need to attack right away.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.000
Let's be confident and positive.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.920
Let's not feel sorry for ourselves!
Let's save that for later!

27:47.120 --> 27:51.240
Now it's time to grow a pair!

27:51.600 --> 27:54.800
Let's look at this fucking board,
are we afraid of Milan?

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
It can't be!

27:57.720 --> 27:59.920
We must play with a clear head!

28:00.000 --> 28:03.760
It's a tough moment,
but a clear head keeps us going!

28:03.960 --> 28:06.600
This is when you see the players, the men.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.800
-Now.
-Let's go!

28:10.280 --> 28:14.760
We're back at Allianz Stadium in Turin,
where the second half of Juve-Milan

28:14.920 --> 28:20.280
is about to begin.
The 35th game of the championship.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.520
It's 4-4-2 for Pirlo versus 4-2-3-1

28:24.680 --> 28:26.480
for Stefano Pioli. Here we go.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.880
Off we go.
Enjoy the second half of Juventus-Milan.

28:33.680 --> 28:39.040
Pioli's line-up goes from
left to right. Diaz, watch out.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.360
Brahim Diaz, he has the ball, Diaz.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.400
Chiellini's arm foul.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.200
Penalty for Milan.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.560
Yellow card for Chiellini.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.680
Kessié shoots.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.240
Saved by Szczęsny!

29:00.480 --> 29:01.800
Juventus needs to try

29:02.000 --> 29:05.440
and gain grit from the great save

29:05.680 --> 29:08.040
of Wojciech Szczęsny. De Ligt.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.880
Chiellini. Watch out for Milan.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.160
Rebić's right-kick.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.640
Two-zero.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.640
Juve must try in some way.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.480
Spread out! Spread out! Spread out!

29:40.400 --> 29:42.720
Penalty for Milan.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.080
Stay in front of him, Ale.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.800
With Hakan Çalhanoğlu.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.600
Header!

29:52.000 --> 29:53.280
Goal, 3-0.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.760
The match is over. Milan wins 3-0

30:11.000 --> 30:13.840
on Juventus' field at Allianz Stadium.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.200
Juve-Milan was a defeat,

30:17.560 --> 30:20.640
an utter defeat for Juventus.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.520
What matters is also more than
just the score. it's not just about

30:26.640 --> 30:28.840
a defeat,

30:28.960 --> 30:32.320
it's losing three points
and sending Milan ahead.

30:32.720 --> 30:37.200
Juventus is now further away
from the next Champions League.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.040
Juventus is now fifth in the rankings

30:49.080 --> 30:52.440
and is likely to be left out
of the Champions League next season.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.760
Meanwhile, an unexpected announcement

30:55.960 --> 30:57.560
shakes Italian soccer.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.760
Gigi Buffon says goodbye to Juventus.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.400
But he might keep playing elsewhere.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.280
Come on.

31:09.640 --> 31:14.840
The best goalkeeper in Italian soccer
leaves the club after playing 19 seasons.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.200
Another piece falling apart
from a struggling team.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.360
Buffon is ambitious, he's 43
and he's proved himself to be reliable.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.400
I have no idea what

31:25.760 --> 31:27.400
I'll do now.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.560
But I consider myself

31:30.200 --> 31:32.240
an accomplished man.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.960
Gigi is special.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.040
I feel privileged

31:38.680 --> 31:41.640
because the teachings

31:42.240 --> 31:46.760
that Gigi gave me
when we were younger and now

31:47.360 --> 31:49.760
that he has a different role...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.400
I'll honestly miss him.

31:53.600 --> 31:59.560
When players like him leave,
it's a big loss, but...

32:00.280 --> 32:01.160
unfortunately,

32:01.320 --> 32:02.480
FEDERICO CHIESA
FORWARD

32:02.560 --> 32:05.960
at some point
you have to tell yourself, "Okay,

32:06.560 --> 32:11.320
I did a lot.
Now it's time to change my life."

32:14.880 --> 32:18.720
Some people say, "No, he has to quit."

32:19.320 --> 32:21.840
But I reply, "Have you ever
been inside the mind,

32:22.040 --> 32:26.520
the body, the soul of Buffon, even
just for an hour?" Then you can't know

32:26.760 --> 32:31.240
why I want to quit
or I want to keep doing this.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.720
I find it pretentious,

32:35.160 --> 32:40.480
when it comes to such personal choices,

32:41.000 --> 32:44.280
to say, "No, it's a good move."
"No, it's a bad move."

32:51.920 --> 32:55.200
In 24 hours,
Juventus will play against Sassuolo,

32:55.280 --> 32:57.200
the first of the four final games.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.760
Juve is now ranked fifth.
Morale isn't the best.

33:02.040 --> 33:06.280
Younger players in particular
really need to give it their all.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.840
They need to understand
that it's not over,

33:18.800 --> 33:23.480
that we're professionals and that
we can still achieve the objective,

33:23.560 --> 33:28.200
so we need to do all it takes.

33:29.200 --> 33:34.000
I'm not going to do this, so we can't
afford to think like the players.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.280
Today players, and you know this...

33:36.760 --> 33:41.440
We go to Sassuolo,
we are professional, strong,

33:41.920 --> 33:46.000
capable of winning in Sassuolo.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.920
It's been like this
for the past nine years.

33:49.160 --> 33:53.760
You've won a Scudetto, two titles...

33:53.840 --> 33:57.080
you went ahead in the Champions League,
you got to the final,

33:57.200 --> 34:00.720
but during these 350 days

34:00.960 --> 34:04.200
there are hard times
that you need to deal with.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.520
You have to find the right balance,
which is hard work

34:07.640 --> 34:10.360
and that is achieved
through great concentration.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.600
I mean, I think we can win in Sassuolo.

34:15.120 --> 34:19.960
Only those who believe we can win
the match should come to Sassuolo.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.440
Otherwise stay at home.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.760
I'm going, I don't want to lose time.

34:31.640 --> 34:36.280
After the announcement of his retirement,
Buffon is preparing to take the field.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.640
Buffon is the best goalkeeper
in the history of soccer.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.960
He has the innate quality...

34:49.560 --> 34:51.280
...of having an extraordinary body

34:51.520 --> 34:55.320
that he consistently nurtures with work.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.960
He also has an exceptional mindset,

34:58.320 --> 35:00.160
which may be his main strength.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.640
Buffon is 43 years old
and he's still teaching me

35:07.960 --> 35:10.680
that the passion for this sport

35:10.800 --> 35:12.480
and for this job come first...

35:12.560 --> 35:15.280
Reserved charter train.
FIGC Covid protocol observed.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.160
He sets an example

35:17.280 --> 35:21.560
in every possible way.
And he always has a positive attitude.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.640
Seeing his great energy and smile instills

35:27.160 --> 35:30.040
positivity in me
and in the entire environment.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.760
Guys, corner kicks.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.440
Mark! Leo! Alex!

35:35.840 --> 35:37.640
-Beat them.
-Rabiot!

35:39.160 --> 35:40.880
Come on, guys. Let's go.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.160
In order to finish fourth
and qualify for the Champions League,

35:51.360 --> 35:53.840
Juve must win against Sassuolo.

35:56.200 --> 36:01.320
Buffon's farewell to Juventus has been
announced for the end of the season.

36:04.160 --> 36:08.160
The 43-year-old is playing his 684th match
with the Bianconeri jersey.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.120
This is one of the last matches
for Juventus legend.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.920
Come on! Let's go!

36:29.040 --> 36:30.160
Well done!

36:39.000 --> 36:40.560
Penalty for Sassuolo.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.920
Buffon saves it!

36:54.000 --> 36:58.200
Gianluigi Buffon's save
with Super Gigi's exultation!

37:03.640 --> 37:05.800
Rabiot! Rabiot! Rabiot!

37:05.960 --> 37:11.120
Rabiot. Juve stretches out.
He aims for the goal. It's Rabiot's goal!

37:11.680 --> 37:14.360
-Yes!
-Juventus is ahead!

37:18.760 --> 37:21.760
Sassuolo, zero. Juventus, one.
With Adrien Rabiot's goal.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.760
Go for it, Cri, go!

37:26.040 --> 37:27.640
Ronaldo aims the goal.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.840
Ronaldo! Juventus scores again!

37:37.680 --> 37:40.800
It's halftime, 2-0 for Juventus.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.200
Come on, guys, one minute.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.560
We knew we were going to play
this kind of match.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.880
The ball must not cross the lines.
Well done, Kulu.

37:52.200 --> 37:56.640
Let's keep it this way a little longer.
What's important is the defense.

37:56.960 --> 38:00.000
Stay here in the center.
We need to suffer a little more,

38:00.160 --> 38:02.320
another 45 minutes.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.160
Go with him, Cri, go with him!

38:18.400 --> 38:20.600
Sassuolo's goal.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
Dybala.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.280
Dybala! One hundred goals

38:33.480 --> 38:36.920
with Juventus' jersey
on this magical night

38:37.040 --> 38:38.400
for Paulo Dybala.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.880
Sassuolo, one. Juventus, three.

38:45.280 --> 38:50.200
The victory over Sassuolo doesn't
guarantee Juventus will qualify.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.800
It's all-in on the last two matches.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.800
You should keep Morata.

38:58.200 --> 39:02.320
Juventus can't only rely
on its own strength,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.200
they also need

39:04.640 --> 39:10.640
the direct competitors' results
to play in their favor.

39:12.360 --> 39:16.440
Fighting for the Champions League
until the last match

39:16.520 --> 39:18.200
is a lot of pressure,

39:18.760 --> 39:22.360
but we need to handle it
with a clear mind and balance.

39:23.560 --> 39:28.480
Playing the Champions League
for us is essential.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.840
Let's grow a pair. Come on!

39:38.440 --> 39:40.680
Chiesa. Chiesa. Chiesa!

39:42.920 --> 39:46.360
I actually get emotional
when I talk about Buffon.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.000
Last match of the championship.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.160
We want to make it
to the Champions and failing

39:53.280 --> 39:55.040
would mean a personal failure.
