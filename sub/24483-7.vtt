<i>I need you to lead a salvage mission.</i>

00:08.588 --> 00:09.989
Bring back the Nauvoo.

00:10.023 --> 00:12.224
<i>Gonna retrofit the ship for the Belt.</i>

00:12.259 --> 00:14.827
You're not staying, are you?

00:14.861 --> 00:17.429
<i>Secretary Errinwright
is under arrest for treason.</i>

00:17.464 --> 00:19.331
- The work.
- What is the work?

00:19.366 --> 00:21.033
<i>What are you building?</i>

00:22.636 --> 00:25.537
What the fuck is that?

That's enough.

01:36.943 --> 01:38.243
It's fine...

01:38.278 --> 01:40.846
pfft, fuck!

01:47.287 --> 01:49.955
My fellow citizens.

01:49.990 --> 01:53.926
Our fate as a nation
has been sorely tested.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.962
But the arrest of the traitor,
Errinwright,

01:56.997 --> 01:59.598
and the resignation of Secretary-General,

01:59.632 --> 02:03.635
Sorrento-Gillis,
whom we thank for his service,

02:03.670 --> 02:06.205
has given us the opportunity

02:06.239 --> 02:09.608
to choose a new future.

02:09.642 --> 02:12.344
Many fought for us to get here.

02:12.379 --> 02:14.780
Many died.

02:14.814 --> 02:19.685
We have lost people we loved,
and have suffered.

02:19.719 --> 02:23.856
We would be justified to seek vengeance.

02:23.890 --> 02:27.726
But instead, we will choose peace...

02:27.761 --> 02:30.466
we must choose peace.

02:31.898 --> 02:34.967
<i>For we have arrived
at the dawn of a new era,</i>

02:35.001 --> 02:38.837
<i>and are witness to an event
unlike anything else</i>

02:38.872 --> 02:41.340
<i>in the history of our species.</i>

02:41.374 --> 02:44.309
<i>But peace is a fragile thing.</i>

02:44.344 --> 02:47.913
<i>So I'm asking you
to join me and join hands</i>

02:47.947 --> 02:51.517
<i>with our brothers and sisters
throughout the system...</i>

02:51.551 --> 02:54.820
<i>Earth, Mars, and the Belt...</i>

02:54.854 --> 02:58.357
<i>and dedicate ourselves

02:58.391 --> 03:00.225

03:00.260 --> 03:02.761
<i>And as we have always done in the past,</i>

03:02.796 --> 03:06.698

07:38.237 --> 07:41.736
But now I gonya show you the real me.

07:42.408 --> 07:45.532
To pull it off,
I mowsh go dark for a time.

07:46.045 --> 07:48.113
This where I gonya be and when.

Only for you, fódagut,

07:50.717 --> 07:53.518
na no say natig fo no one.

07:55.154 --> 07:57.556
Next words you hear about Manéo,

07:57.590 --> 07:59.754
whole Belt gonya say 'em.

08:00.426 --> 08:02.027
And all mang gonya know,

08:02.061 --> 08:04.363
I do this for you.

08:40.032 --> 08:42.839
A lot of people think you're special.

08:43.535 --> 08:45.504
- You're pretty stealthy.
- Part of the job.

08:45.538 --> 08:48.106
You'll get used to it.
Could we try that again?

08:48.141 --> 08:51.510
So, a lot of people think you're special.

08:51.544 --> 08:54.119
Special? I don't know about special.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.247
Lucky, maybe.

08:55.281 --> 08:58.183
You have definitely been called that.

08:58.217 --> 09:00.085
Well, what's that old saying?

09:00.119 --> 09:02.020
It's better to be lucky than good?

09:02.054 --> 09:03.755
All right, then, lucky.

09:03.790 --> 09:06.024
So tell me... why, after everything

09:06.058 --> 09:07.626
you've been through and somehow managed

09:07.660 --> 09:10.095
to make it out alive, here you are again

09:10.129 --> 09:13.031
on the edge of the unknown.
Why push your luck?

09:13.065 --> 09:15.133
Because you're paying us.

09:15.168 --> 09:16.535
Jules-Pierre Mao's project

09:16.569 --> 09:18.370
wreaked havoc throughout the system.

09:18.404 --> 09:20.205
The Protomolecule killed so many,

09:20.239 --> 09:22.307
brought Earth and Mars
to the brink of annihilation,

09:22.341 --> 09:24.276
You had a major effect on those events.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.978
And that led you to this... The Ring.

09:27.013 --> 09:28.246
How does that make you feel?

09:28.281 --> 09:29.648
Kind of makes me want a donut.

09:29.682 --> 09:31.917
You're deflecting again.

09:31.951 --> 09:34.820
It's there. I don't know what it is.

09:34.854 --> 09:37.456
But there's plenty of people
way smarter than me

09:37.490 --> 09:39.157
out here trying to figure it out.

09:39.192 --> 09:40.759
We're just trying to make a living.

09:40.793 --> 09:43.962
It's not cheap or easy
to maintain a ship like this.

09:43.996 --> 09:45.497
Especially if it's not really yours.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.599
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa,
hold on there, darling...

09:48.801 --> 09:50.068
It's a legitimate salvage.

09:50.102 --> 09:51.603
That's not what the Martians think.

09:51.637 --> 09:54.072
Seems a bit petty,
since we saved their planet.

09:54.106 --> 09:55.417
Guess that's just gonna have to be

09:55.441 --> 09:57.242
up to the Courts to decide, ma'am.

09:57.276 --> 09:59.254
Would you have done this
documentary if we didn't agree

09:59.278 --> 10:02.013
- to pay your legal fees?
- Nope.

10:02.048 --> 10:03.292
Hell, I might've done it for free.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.951
The "Roci" is such a beautiful ship,

10:05.985 --> 10:09.020
and she's got us out of more
scrapes than I can count...

10:09.055 --> 10:10.455
That sounds really interesting,

10:10.490 --> 10:12.457
and I will get back to you on that.

10:12.492 --> 10:13.959
So what about you?

10:13.993 --> 10:15.760
You just here for the money too?

10:17.630 --> 10:21.366
There's only so much booze
and fucking you can buy.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.802
I'm gonna be on a ship
one way or the other,

10:23.836 --> 10:25.136
at least this one's part mine.

10:25.171 --> 10:28.340
We are a regular, working-contract ship,

10:28.374 --> 10:31.543
even split, fair quarter-share
for everybody.

10:31.577 --> 10:34.492
Quarter? There's only
three of you on board.

10:35.481 --> 10:37.349
<i>What happened to Naomi Nagata?</i>

10:40.319 --> 10:42.954
<i>She's on a leave of absence.</i>

11:03.609 --> 11:06.511
<i>This is a special price, one time only,</i>

11:06.546 --> 11:08.353
<i>only for you, valued customer.</i>

11:08.388 --> 11:11.154
Just give im to me already.

11:21.861 --> 11:25.502
On Tycho, that would
get you six months in jail.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.401
Maybe the part of Tycho you get to be in.

11:29.435 --> 11:32.696
Out here, fo da real rock
hopper on the long haul,

11:32.697 --> 11:34.798
Da Pixie fo keep you alert,

11:34.832 --> 11:37.967
focus, make you love what you do,

11:38.002 --> 11:40.266
whatever im you do.

11:41.706 --> 11:43.006
Come now, Belta.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.774
No you be like those
high and mighty Inners

11:44.809 --> 11:45.942
you used to crew with.

11:47.178 --> 11:48.855
<i>The shuttle just dock.
Where the fuck you be?</i>

11:48.879 --> 11:50.735
On my way.

11:51.482 --> 11:55.018
I don't wanna see that shit
where people are working.

11:55.052 --> 11:56.886
If they wanna do it,

11:56.921 --> 11:58.688
they can do it on their own time.

11:58.723 --> 12:00.857
You get no trouble from me, bosmang.

12:18.843 --> 12:20.510
<i>You're late.</i>

12:20.544 --> 12:22.178
And you're cranky.

12:22.213 --> 12:24.547
We both knew this was coming.

12:24.582 --> 12:26.049
We do all the hard work...

12:26.083 --> 12:29.018
And Dawes has to make it
look like it's his.

12:29.053 --> 12:31.321
That's what you get
when you dance with the devil.

12:31.355 --> 12:33.923
And we've both done that before.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.525
You know I've got your back.

12:35.559 --> 12:37.949
Damn well better, I'm your Captain.

12:38.429 --> 12:40.830
<i>And no one's going to change that.</i>

13:03.921 --> 13:06.055
Commander Klaes Ashford,

13:06.090 --> 13:09.025
requesting permission to come aboard.

13:09.059 --> 13:12.128
- You're already here.
- It's a tradition.

13:12.163 --> 13:14.697
Can I say no?

13:14.732 --> 13:16.633
- No.
- Hm.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.902
Ah, Camina.

13:18.936 --> 13:22.038
Long time since the docks on Ceres.

13:22.072 --> 13:23.706
You have done well for yourself.

13:23.741 --> 13:27.043
You too, of course that
always was your main concern.

13:31.782 --> 13:33.616
You remember Mister Harari...

13:33.651 --> 13:35.385
You little shit.

13:35.419 --> 13:39.255
- He has no place on this ship.
- Dawes wants him here.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.291
And Fred just let him
walk out of his hole.

13:41.325 --> 13:45.628
Eh? The OPA officially
granted him amnesty.

13:45.663 --> 13:47.764
Fred didn't tell you?

13:47.798 --> 13:50.400
Ah, I'm sure it was a mistake.

13:50.434 --> 13:53.002
I talk to Cortazar, he say to say hello.

13:53.037 --> 13:55.004
Shut your face, mister.

13:55.039 --> 13:57.173
That is Naomi Nagata,

13:57.208 --> 13:59.275
whose service to the Belt was far greater

13:59.310 --> 14:01.945
than yours could ever be,

14:01.979 --> 14:06.416
and that is your commanding officer.

14:06.450 --> 14:08.017
You're a Lieutenant in the OPA Navy,

14:08.052 --> 14:09.619
now start acting like one.

14:09.653 --> 14:12.121
Yes, sir. My apology.

14:12.156 --> 14:14.157
Matching outfits? Really?

14:14.191 --> 14:16.659
Ah, it's a... a work in progress.

14:16.694 --> 14:19.929
I'm still getting used
to being in uniform myself.

14:19.964 --> 14:21.598
- Mm.
- But...

14:21.632 --> 14:23.199
It's growing on me.

14:23.234 --> 14:26.636
Certainly better than the clothes

14:26.670 --> 14:28.938
of indentured servitude.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.543
Welcome to the Behemoth.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.716
I can feel the love already.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.392
You look like you've
discovered something.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.710
- 187 days.
- Since the Ring was formed?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.914
187 days, 16 hours, 53 minutes,

15:15.948 --> 15:18.316
and in that time,
we've detected no radiation,

15:18.350 --> 15:20.552
no signals, no emissions of any kind.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.420
What about the Martians? Their probes are

15:22.454 --> 15:24.065
better than ours...
have you compared notes?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.329
We are friends now, you know...

15:25.357 --> 15:26.668
They corroborate all our findings.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.170
You know what, when the Protomolecule

15:28.194 --> 15:30.698
first came off Venus,
it looked like a squid to me,

15:30.699 --> 15:33.334
and it's behaved
like a virus in the past.

15:33.368 --> 15:35.336
Do you think it might've
been alive in some way?

15:35.370 --> 15:37.295
- A life-form?
- Yeah.

15:37.873 --> 15:39.540
Aren't you part of the godly contingent?

15:39.574 --> 15:41.352
Well, I came here on
a spaceship, not the wings

15:41.376 --> 15:43.676
of an angel... I'm able to
appreciate the difference.

15:45.059 --> 15:47.694
- Are you rich or famous?
- Neither.

15:47.883 --> 15:49.784
Then how did you get a ride on this ship?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.552
The Secretary-General made me an offer

15:51.586 --> 15:54.789
that I couldn't refuse. You
don't think it's a life-form?

15:54.823 --> 15:57.625
There's no doubt in my mind.
That is a piece of technology.

15:57.659 --> 15:59.527
I remember reading about the first probes

15:59.561 --> 16:02.296
to leave Earth for the
solar system, centuries ago.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.432
They had examples of our culture.

16:04.466 --> 16:06.534
Could it be something similar to that?

16:06.568 --> 16:09.537
The Protomolecule was
discovered inside Phoebe,

16:09.571 --> 16:13.040
an extrasolar object
captured by Saturn eons ago

16:13.075 --> 16:15.142
that came from who knows where.

16:15.177 --> 16:16.911
It transformed Eros...

16:16.945 --> 16:19.246
inorganic materials and biologicals...

16:19.281 --> 16:22.249
into some kind of zero-inertia missile.

16:22.284 --> 16:25.052
Then after crashing into Venus,
it reached out,

16:25.087 --> 16:27.088
deconstructed the "Arboghast,"

16:27.122 --> 16:30.591
and flew all the way out here
and turned itself into this.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.560
An intelligence created it...

16:32.594 --> 16:34.562
an extremely intelligent intelligence.

16:34.596 --> 16:36.437
What do you think it is?

16:38.266 --> 16:40.149
Pray that it's inert.

16:44.139 --> 16:47.775
Mariner Valley Stroganoff,
a Kamal family recipe.

16:47.809 --> 16:50.277
Now, mind you, the beef is soy,

16:50.312 --> 16:54.148
the cheese is soy,
but these mushrooms, mmm,

16:54.182 --> 16:55.750
are mushrooms.

16:56.952 --> 16:59.787
- Family dinner's always nice.
- Mmm.

16:59.821 --> 17:03.023
So you still have family
on Mars, isn't that right?

17:03.058 --> 17:04.525
Yeah, that's right.

17:04.559 --> 17:06.550
When was the last time you saw them?

17:07.628 --> 17:10.137
It's been a while, but we send messages,

17:10.172 --> 17:12.098
just like everyone else in the system.

17:12.134 --> 17:13.800
Voila.

17:13.835 --> 17:15.502
That's yours, cowboy.

17:15.537 --> 17:17.271
So, mechanic on a gunship.

17:17.305 --> 17:20.540
That's probably one of the most
dangerous job you could have.

17:20.575 --> 17:23.511
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- This man is fearless.

17:23.545 --> 17:25.112
So did you study at a university

17:25.146 --> 17:26.891
or did you come up
through an apprenticeship?

17:26.915 --> 17:28.783
Union apprentice... I started off

17:28.817 --> 17:30.785
on the supply and logistics track, but,

17:30.819 --> 17:32.453
I was always better as a mechanic.

17:32.487 --> 17:34.078
Who was your sponsor?

17:34.890 --> 17:36.457
I didn't have one.

17:36.491 --> 17:38.559
So you came up through the lottery?

17:38.593 --> 17:39.994
- Yup.
- Wow.

17:40.028 --> 17:41.572
You don't see a lot
of people come up through

17:41.596 --> 17:43.297
the apprentice program off Basic.

17:43.331 --> 17:45.299
I guess I got lucky.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.009
So where were you based
before you came up the well?

17:49.738 --> 17:52.473
No place in particular,
you know how it is...

17:52.507 --> 17:54.809
Your intake papers said Baltimore.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.479
I spent some time there.

17:58.513 --> 17:59.713
Yeah, I actually couldn't find

17:59.748 --> 18:00.992
any records of you on the roles.

18:01.016 --> 18:02.483
In fact, you don't seem to have any

18:02.517 --> 18:04.051
official government records at all,

18:04.085 --> 18:06.887
apart from a birth certificate
and a registered win

18:06.922 --> 18:09.864
with the Apprenticeship Lottery
when you were 15.

18:10.425 --> 18:11.725
Weird.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.828
I did talk to some locals though,

18:13.862 --> 18:17.331
and they told me about a guy
who was also named Amos Burton

18:17.365 --> 18:19.400
who was some sort of mob boss.

18:19.434 --> 18:20.711
But that couldn't be you, right,

18:20.735 --> 18:23.044
'cause you left the city
when you were 15.

18:23.705 --> 18:26.589
So maybe it was like a relative?

18:27.609 --> 18:29.676
Maybe it's just a common name.

18:29.710 --> 18:30.843
You think?

18:44.659 --> 18:46.567
Not so close.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.965
You're gonna have to pay for that.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.200
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

18:53.235 --> 18:55.035
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

18:55.070 --> 18:56.904
I'm making a documentary,
the point is to get

18:56.938 --> 18:59.106
under your skin and into your head.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.242
You can't be surprised that
I did background on you.

19:01.276 --> 19:02.977
I don't like it.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.089
What is it gonna take for you
to get comfortable with me?

19:05.113 --> 19:07.171
You being off the ship.

19:10.919 --> 19:13.052
What are you doing right now?

19:13.922 --> 19:15.890
This.

19:15.924 --> 19:18.058
I bet you're one of those

19:18.093 --> 19:20.227
tough guys who gets really sentimental

19:20.262 --> 19:22.494
and chatty after sex.

19:31.439 --> 19:33.941
I don't shit where I eat.

19:39.047 --> 19:42.016
<i>The PDCs and missile systems
are nominally operational,</i>

19:42.050 --> 19:43.751
<i>but they haven't been fully tested.</i>

19:43.785 --> 19:45.753
And the rail guns
won't be ready for a while.

19:45.787 --> 19:47.878
Well, that's disappointing.

19:49.491 --> 19:51.191
This ship was designed to be

19:51.226 --> 19:53.794
filled with Mormons, not bullets.

19:53.828 --> 19:56.263
We put it to better use
than they ever could.

19:56.298 --> 19:57.765
What a surprise...

19:57.799 --> 20:00.301
a pirate who supports an act of piracy.

20:00.335 --> 20:03.804
Oh, I'm patriot now.

20:03.838 --> 20:08.142
And this... this warship is a symbol.

20:09.811 --> 20:12.613
It is the greatest vessel
in human history,

20:12.647 --> 20:14.481
and built by Beltalowda.

20:14.516 --> 20:17.017
That is something
the Inners cannot ignore,

20:17.052 --> 20:20.454
because they know if we can do this,

20:20.488 --> 20:22.663
then that is just the beginning.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.534
We've got an issue in the forward

20:33.568 --> 20:35.536
maneuvering cluster RCS.

20:35.570 --> 20:38.372
- How bad?
- Manageable,

20:38.406 --> 20:41.675
but we'll have to cut our
braking burn to deal with it.

20:57.359 --> 20:59.626
Locational thrusters online.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.331
Primary power online.

21:04.366 --> 21:05.666
<i>I'm ready.</i>

21:10.038 --> 21:11.921
Hey, Grigori.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.247
Grigori...

21:20.281 --> 21:22.932
I was about to apologize.

21:23.718 --> 21:26.453
- Hard to believe.
- But it's true though.

21:26.488 --> 21:28.389
I am sorry.

21:28.423 --> 21:31.792
Now there, that's what you
wanted to hear, right?

21:31.826 --> 21:34.061
- Yes.
- Then we're good?

21:37.032 --> 21:39.408
Okay, we're good.

21:45.206 --> 21:46.840
What's all this about?

21:46.875 --> 21:49.500
Oh, we used to work together.

21:54.482 --> 21:56.950
<i>On deck. Secure for zero-g.</i>

22:01.423 --> 22:03.090
How is your stomach?

22:03.124 --> 22:04.792
Oh, please.

22:04.826 --> 22:07.127
Oh, Dawes asked me to ask.

22:07.162 --> 22:11.298
He was very worried when
he heard you got shot.

22:11.332 --> 22:13.367
Aw, I had his name tattooed

22:13.401 --> 22:15.736
around the wound to remind me.

22:15.770 --> 22:18.539
I forgot how funny you are.

22:18.573 --> 22:21.542
It was an unauthorized
Black Sky operation,

22:21.576 --> 22:23.143
Dawes had nothing to do...

22:23.178 --> 22:25.579
I'm sure you're a pretty good
shot too, huh?

22:25.613 --> 22:27.147
So am I.

22:27.182 --> 22:29.883
Camina, you have nothing
to worry about from me.

22:29.918 --> 22:31.985
I'm here to be your first officer,

22:32.020 --> 22:33.620
and I have no problem with that...

22:33.655 --> 22:35.389
You believe you should be in command.

22:35.423 --> 22:38.625
Ah, of course I do, but this
is not about experience.

22:38.660 --> 22:42.386
It's about politics and perception.

22:43.431 --> 22:46.600
Fred has Protomolecule,
Dawes has Cortazar,

22:46.634 --> 22:48.502
and they both need this ship.

22:48.536 --> 22:50.571
They both have delusions of grandeur.

22:50.605 --> 22:52.306
And neither one of them cares

22:52.340 --> 22:55.576
if you or I are happy
with the arrangement.

22:55.610 --> 22:59.446
Ah, finally, some truth.

22:59.481 --> 23:01.582
I haven't lied to you...

23:01.616 --> 23:03.484
Yet.

23:03.518 --> 23:07.588
But my point is that
we both have orders to follow,

23:07.622 --> 23:12.092
which means we have to work together.

23:12.127 --> 23:17.631
For the good of the new Belter state, ke?

23:22.504 --> 23:23.804
What's wrong?

23:23.838 --> 23:25.806
A construction skiff malfunctioned.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.975
It's stuck in a hard spin.
Pilot's not responding.

23:28.009 --> 23:31.011
Ah, it's 1-G-plus.
He must've blacked out.

23:31.045 --> 23:33.380
- He won't last long.
- Is he gonna hit the hull?

23:33.414 --> 23:34.781
Not if I can help it.

23:34.816 --> 23:37.284
I'm trying to access
the ship's drive by remote.

23:41.089 --> 23:42.456
Got it.

23:42.490 --> 23:44.158
Killing the drive now.

23:44.192 --> 23:46.293
I'll bring it back to the dock.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.142
<i>It's too late. He's gone.</i>

24:25.976 --> 24:28.205
<i>I hate to admit, I kinda
missed that old red sky.</i>

24:28.206 --> 24:29.750
Haven't been back to Mars
since I was shipped out

24:29.774 --> 24:30.953
for Phoebe, way back when.

24:30.988 --> 24:33.911
<i>I'm not gonna lie, I'm kinda jealous.</i>

24:33.945 --> 24:37.081
Thank you, by the way,
for looking in on my family.

24:37.115 --> 24:38.782
That means a lot.

24:38.817 --> 24:40.337
<i>Your kid was sweet.</i>

24:40.852 --> 24:42.686
<i>Your wife was...</i>

24:42.720 --> 24:44.008
<i>Polite.</i>

24:44.856 --> 24:46.173
<i>You guys talking?</i>

24:46.208 --> 24:48.092
Yeah, sorta.

24:49.961 --> 24:52.362
Talissa filed for divorce.

24:52.397 --> 24:53.684
Oh.

24:54.799 --> 24:56.266
How do you feel about that?

24:56.301 --> 24:59.203
Honestly, kinda relieved.

25:01.473 --> 25:03.340
- Does that make me an asshole?
<i>- Nah.</i>

25:03.374 --> 25:05.142
The domestic side of things
never really held

25:05.176 --> 25:07.197
that much appeal for me either.

25:07.712 --> 25:10.868
It's better to know what
you want and who you are.

25:11.983 --> 25:13.951
I'm damn glad to be a Marine again.

25:13.985 --> 25:15.452
<i>If I hadn't been reinstated,</i>

25:15.487 --> 25:17.187
<i>I don't know what I would've done.</i>

25:21.526 --> 25:23.527
<i>You know, my fellow
soldiers might dispute</i>

25:23.561 --> 25:26.196
<i>how you took ownership of your ship, but,</i>

25:26.231 --> 25:28.132
<i>you earned that seat you're in.</i>

25:28.166 --> 25:30.304
<i>You're a top notch pilot.</i>

25:30.869 --> 25:32.503
<i>You can fly me anytime.</i>

25:32.537 --> 25:34.138
<i>Gotta go.</i>

25:34.172 --> 25:37.141
Well, it was good talking to you, Gunny.

25:37.175 --> 25:39.710
Thank you.

25:44.949 --> 25:47.050
You have a moment?

25:47.085 --> 25:50.988
For you, sure. What's on your mind?

25:51.022 --> 25:52.523
That skiff pilot...

25:52.557 --> 25:55.893
He was incapacitated. Pixie Dust.

25:55.927 --> 25:57.427
Yeah.

25:57.462 --> 25:59.958
That's what I wanted to talk about.

26:00.532 --> 26:02.332
There's a black market trade on board.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.401
Always is on missions like this.

26:04.435 --> 26:06.770
Not much else to do for fun.

26:06.804 --> 26:09.706
I saw the skiff pilot
with a dealer earlier.

26:09.741 --> 26:11.408
I should've told you about it.

26:11.442 --> 26:15.012
Why? Did you believe
the pilot was a risk?

26:15.046 --> 26:16.547
I didn't think so.

26:16.581 --> 26:19.645
His work had been fine up until now.

26:20.752 --> 26:23.187
I misjudged the situation.

26:23.221 --> 26:26.356
I made you Chief Engineer
because I learned to trust you.

26:26.391 --> 26:28.058
- I'm sorry.
- I don't expect

26:28.092 --> 26:30.360
to be perfect, or anyone.

26:30.395 --> 26:32.763
That skiff driver was free
to put whatever he liked

26:32.797 --> 26:35.365
into his body... we all are...

26:35.400 --> 26:38.372
until that freedom puts others at risk.

26:38.903 --> 26:41.291
And then we act accordingly.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.374
Who is the dealer?

26:46.978 --> 26:48.879
<i>Security detail to the dock.</i>

26:48.913 --> 26:50.614
<i>Captain will meet you there.</i>

26:59.357 --> 27:00.824
<i>It's nice to see that</i>

27:00.858 --> 27:03.794
<i>Madam Avasarala is as good as her word.</i>

27:03.828 --> 27:05.996
<i>Donations have been
rolling into the clinic,</i>

27:06.030 --> 27:08.398
<i>it's never been in better shape.</i>

27:08.433 --> 27:11.134
<i>And I have never felt worse.</i>

27:11.169 --> 27:14.471
<i>First it was a few weeks away
to write a speech at the UN,</i>

27:14.505 --> 27:16.940
<i>now it's months at the edge
of the solar system?</i>

27:16.975 --> 27:18.909
<i>I know the people that you're around now</i>

27:18.943 --> 27:20.944
<i>could probably keep
the clinic going forever,</i>

27:20.979 --> 27:24.081
<i>and that makes it worth it,
but you are so far away</i>

27:24.115 --> 27:27.284
<i>from us, so close to that thing.</i>

27:27.318 --> 27:30.087
<i>I'm just afraid... I am afraid that this</i>

27:30.121 --> 27:33.257
<i>is the way our lives
are going to be from now on.</i>

27:33.291 --> 27:35.592
<i>I miss you, your daughter misses you,</i>

27:35.627 --> 27:38.161
<i>and we love you very much.</i>

27:38.196 --> 27:41.198
<i>Come home soon. Please.</i>

27:42.667 --> 27:45.469
<i>- Lead service team K-47.</i>

27:45.503 --> 27:48.609
<i>Please report to your skiff.
You are clear to depart.</i>

28:01.386 --> 28:04.121
Hey Melba, did you clock in
before you showered?

28:04.155 --> 28:05.522
- What?
- You should clock in

28:05.556 --> 28:07.301
before you shower...
log it as decontamination

28:07.325 --> 28:08.590
and tool check time.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.961
You wanna pad out your time,
Ren here knows all the angles.

28:10.995 --> 28:13.030
Secret teachings, hidden wisdom.

28:13.064 --> 28:14.498
Okay, I will.

28:14.532 --> 28:17.067
Ahh, this James Holden. You watching him?

28:17.101 --> 28:18.568
The guy who chased Eros, right?

28:18.603 --> 28:20.470
Mm-hmm, and put that
shithead Mao in jail.

28:20.505 --> 28:22.239
- What about him?
- Well, he's out here.

28:22.273 --> 28:24.174
They're making a documentary about him.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.519
- No shit.
- Yeah, he's got cameras

28:25.543 --> 28:27.020
following him around on his ship.

28:27.021 --> 28:29.589
I bet you 50 this reporter
lady's knocking boots with him.

28:29.623 --> 28:32.236
Hey, new girl?

28:32.860 --> 28:34.947
Like what you see?

28:35.629 --> 28:38.098
I wouldn't rub up against
that narcissistic asshole

28:38.132 --> 28:40.166
with your junk.

28:45.206 --> 28:47.273
We still have to
finish up on the junction.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.109
Stanni, you take deck six, okay?

28:49.143 --> 28:51.311
Yeah, whatever you say, chief.

28:52.646 --> 28:54.614
Buffers are behind that panel there.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.850
Get to work and I'll check
back with you in a few, okay?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.561
Hey, hey, hey.

29:08.596 --> 29:11.064
Listen, the first contract's
always the toughest.

29:11.098 --> 29:12.832
Stick with us, we'll get you through it.

29:12.867 --> 29:15.168
You got a question, you just ask.

29:15.202 --> 29:17.704
And if you don't wanna
ask Stanni, ask me.

29:17.738 --> 29:19.366
Okay?

29:20.708 --> 29:22.911
- Okay.
- Good.

29:23.544 --> 29:26.479
I'll get the junction set, you
stay at the brownout buffers.

29:59.238 --> 30:01.158
No cameras.

30:03.442 --> 30:05.910
So this is your spot, huh?

30:05.944 --> 30:08.123
Until you came through the hatch.

30:09.181 --> 30:10.815
You know, if this project's gonna work,

30:10.849 --> 30:12.494
we're gonna have to
learn to trust each other.

30:12.518 --> 30:14.252
I don't care if it works.

30:14.286 --> 30:17.021
You don't care how you
come across to other people?

30:17.056 --> 30:18.423
No.

30:22.227 --> 30:24.329
Prayer plant,

30:24.363 --> 30:28.099
cabbage, Magnus.

30:28.133 --> 30:30.435
It's unusual to find green
walls on a ship like this.

30:30.469 --> 30:32.356
I call them Prax panels.

30:33.038 --> 30:34.772
What's a Prax?

30:34.807 --> 30:36.652
He's a botanist.

30:37.142 --> 30:39.444
He helped us, and we helped
him find his little girl.

30:39.478 --> 30:40.745
Where are they now?

30:40.779 --> 30:43.047
They're both on Ganymede Station.

30:43.082 --> 30:45.118
Prax is helping them rebuild it.

30:45.984 --> 30:47.412
You miss him?

30:47.920 --> 30:49.587
He was good company.

30:52.758 --> 30:55.295
He was my best friend in the whole world.

30:55.828 --> 30:57.862
- Why didn't you go with him?
- He didn't ask.

30:57.896 --> 30:59.931
He didn't have to.

30:59.965 --> 31:01.766
I'm not really the rebuilding type.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.536
In these uncertain times,
it's more important than ever

31:05.571 --> 31:07.599
that we learn to love each other.

31:08.006 --> 31:10.310
I heard you shot down Monica.

31:11.009 --> 31:13.077
Does that mean I have a chance?

31:15.614 --> 31:17.651
Like I told her,

31:18.250 --> 31:20.278
I don't shit where I eat.

31:20.686 --> 31:22.698
Well, you live on a spaceship.

31:23.155 --> 31:25.534
And I don't shit in the galley.

31:34.266 --> 31:36.601
<i>Hey Stanni,
I'm gonna check in with Melba.</i>

31:36.635 --> 31:38.569
<i>Let me know how far along we are.</i>

31:41.306 --> 31:42.573
Okay, bypass is safe.

31:42.608 --> 31:44.075
Swap her out.

31:52.718 --> 31:55.647
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
flip that buffer around.

31:56.555 --> 31:57.858
Yeah.

31:58.824 --> 32:01.359
Put that in the wrong way,
the power goes dirty.

32:01.393 --> 32:03.204
Sends a fault, so the
next one goes to stand by,

32:03.228 --> 32:04.929
then the one after that, and pretty soon,

32:04.963 --> 32:06.431
you got a whole ship powered down.

32:06.465 --> 32:09.133
Then we gotta go over here,
reset everything by hand.

32:09.168 --> 32:11.413
It's a major-league pain in the ass.

32:11.870 --> 32:13.371
Well, that's not a good design.

32:13.405 --> 32:15.116
Better to fail safe
than to blow something out

32:15.140 --> 32:17.275
a million klicks from a shipyard.

32:17.309 --> 32:19.644
Right. I'm sorry.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.147
I'm out of my depth.

32:23.182 --> 32:25.683
It's okay, you're gonna be just fine.

32:25.717 --> 32:27.485
I promise.

32:27.519 --> 32:29.220
Thanks.

32:33.992 --> 32:35.860
What's going on?

32:52.444 --> 32:54.412
What are you doing?

32:54.446 --> 32:56.814
This one supplies him.

32:56.849 --> 32:59.250
I'm going to space him,
and make him watch,

32:59.284 --> 33:00.685
in full view of the crew.

33:02.187 --> 33:04.222
- Camina...
- Walk away. This is mine.

33:04.256 --> 33:06.802
You do not have to be part of it.

33:07.259 --> 33:10.061
Captain! May I have a word?

33:10.095 --> 33:12.163
- In a minute.
- Now.

33:12.197 --> 33:15.166
Clear out, give the Captain
a little goddamn space.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.268
Beltalowda! Don't cross this guy!

33:17.302 --> 33:18.870
Move! Stay there!

33:18.904 --> 33:21.539
You, stay there, don't move,
official business.

33:21.573 --> 33:23.174
You don't have to do this.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.510
How many have you spaced
for reasons just like this?

33:25.544 --> 33:27.912
More than I'd like to admit,
but we're not pirates

33:27.946 --> 33:30.848
or rock hoppers anymore,
we're citizens of the Belt...

33:30.883 --> 33:33.184
- Oh, come on.
- And we have to start acting

33:33.218 --> 33:36.854
like members of a society
that obeys the rule of law,

33:36.889 --> 33:39.123
not like the animals that the Inners

33:39.157 --> 33:41.926
have always portrayed us to be.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.029
If we ever want to be accepted as equals

33:45.063 --> 33:47.965
with the great nations of Earth and Mars,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.345
we must act with greatness.

33:51.236 --> 33:53.538
<i>- Let me out!</i>

33:55.507 --> 33:57.808
<i>Help! Help!</i>

34:00.112 --> 34:02.413
I don't like him either,

34:02.447 --> 34:04.916
but in this, he's not wrong.

34:04.950 --> 34:06.884
<i>Please!</i>

34:21.132 --> 34:25.235
This door will be open for one shift.

34:25.270 --> 34:28.505
If anyone has any contraband
in their possession,

34:28.540 --> 34:31.775
they have until then to put it in here,

34:31.810 --> 34:34.431
with no repercussion.

34:35.981 --> 34:38.783
- After that...
- Anyone caught dealing

34:38.817 --> 34:41.418
will be thrown in the brig,
court-martialed,

34:41.453 --> 34:44.655
and sent back to Ceres for incarceration

34:44.690 --> 34:46.824
on a prison barge.

34:46.858 --> 34:49.328
Those are our Captain's orders.

34:52.697 --> 34:53.965
Well, spread the word.

34:53.998 --> 34:58.102
Everybody out! It's done, it's over.

34:58.136 --> 35:02.306
Back to your posts. It's done.

35:37.229 --> 35:38.963
<i>Néo,</i>

35:38.991 --> 35:40.892
<i>I hit you with a tight-beam
along your way...</i>

35:40.926 --> 35:43.959
<i>at the crazy speed you're
going, that no easy trick.</i>

35:44.764 --> 35:48.004
<i>Means I really want you to hear this.</i>

35:49.502 --> 35:51.836
<i>I think maybe I was wrong about you.</i>

35:55.508 --> 35:57.889
<i>You pull this one off...</i>

36:01.180 --> 36:04.649
<i>This gonya be waiting for you
when you get back.</i>

36:07.453 --> 36:10.822
Oh.

36:10.856 --> 36:12.557
Oh-oh.

36:12.591 --> 36:14.092
Hoo!

36:18.364 --> 36:22.434
Ah, that looks roughly
like, uh, 50 kilos.

36:22.468 --> 36:26.171
You think this act of mercy
makes us better?

36:26.205 --> 36:29.337
A small step, but forward.

36:30.309 --> 36:33.011
This is not who we are.

36:40.076 --> 36:42.144
Who do you think we are?

36:45.124 --> 36:47.522
I'll rephrase that.

36:48.327 --> 36:50.567
Who do you think we should be?

36:50.789 --> 36:52.924
I agree with the Captain.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.750
I admire your loyalty,

36:54.775 --> 36:56.748
but I don't believe you.

36:57.570 --> 37:01.973
You were a radical,
and then you were betrayed.

37:02.007 --> 37:04.309
Then you hid out with the Inners,

37:04.343 --> 37:07.333
and then you become a big hero.

37:07.847 --> 37:11.316
So why is Naomi Nagata here with us now?

37:13.419 --> 37:15.425
I think this is our time...

37:15.955 --> 37:18.136
time for the Belt to stand up.

37:18.924 --> 37:22.227
If not now, it may be never.

37:24.130 --> 37:28.233
Well, perhaps you should
explain that to Drummer.

37:28.267 --> 37:31.436
She needs to hear it
from someone she trusts.

37:53.359 --> 37:56.553
<i>Yeah, I'm almost packed up.
See you at the skiff.</i>

37:56.588 --> 37:58.051
Copy that.

37:59.298 --> 38:01.699
Aw, damn it, I forgot my flask.

38:01.734 --> 38:04.068
You go on, I'll be right there.

38:36.435 --> 38:37.969
Jesus.

38:40.506 --> 38:43.054
Why'd you have to look?

38:44.343 --> 38:45.991
Melba,

38:46.579 --> 38:48.580
what in God's name have you been doing?

38:48.614 --> 38:50.148
I have to do this.

38:50.182 --> 38:54.352
No, you don't.
No, you don't have to do this.

38:54.386 --> 38:57.922
We can make this go away, I'll help you.

38:57.957 --> 38:59.757
No one will ever know it was ever here.

38:59.792 --> 39:02.037
- It'll be our little secret...
- You didn't have to look.

39:02.061 --> 39:03.495
I really wish you hadn't.

39:03.529 --> 39:05.163
Melba, I fought people before.

39:05.197 --> 39:07.098
Please don't make me hurt you.

39:07.132 --> 39:08.396
I'm sorry.

39:09.267 --> 39:10.934
I'm so sorry.

39:24.483 --> 39:25.617
Melba...

39:44.152 --> 39:45.805
When I was in the navy.

39:45.830 --> 39:48.448
They said that in battle you
weren't fighting for your country;

39:48.449 --> 39:50.914
you were fighting for
the people next to you.

39:51.585 --> 39:54.487
- We've come to trust each other.
- Including Naomi?

39:55.221 --> 39:58.337
Yes, I trust Naomi.

39:58.371 --> 40:00.939
I don't always agree with her decisions

40:00.973 --> 40:02.340
or her tactics, but...

40:02.375 --> 40:04.677
I think that you are, are liars.

40:05.177 --> 40:06.638
All of you.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.748
Excuse me?

40:09.782 --> 40:11.883
I don't think anyone
on this ship is being honest

40:11.917 --> 40:14.563
about why you're here, what you want,

40:14.588 --> 40:16.224
and who you are.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.926
Umm, okay.

40:20.951 --> 40:24.405
You say you're not special...
it's obvious that you are.

40:25.164 --> 40:27.450
And I think you like that you are.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.372
I think you're trying
to get a rise out of me,

40:34.407 --> 40:38.410
and I think I'm going to grab a shower

40:38.444 --> 40:40.046
and some sleep.

40:41.781 --> 40:43.715
- I'll see you later.
- No hard feelings?

40:43.749 --> 40:45.677
Not yet.

40:50.022 --> 40:51.500
I think we got some good moments there.

40:51.524 --> 40:52.824
Yeah, I thought so too.

40:52.858 --> 40:54.169
I'm gonna start cutting this together.

40:54.193 --> 40:55.894
I'll catch up with you later.

40:55.928 --> 40:57.506
I'm gonna run some
diagnostics on the drone,

40:57.530 --> 40:59.357
make sure it's 100%.

40:59.932 --> 41:03.034
My supply is not infinite.

41:40.706 --> 41:42.540
<i>This is the MCRN Hammurabi</i>

41:42.575 --> 41:44.876
<i>to unidentified vessel
approaching the Ring.</i>

41:44.910 --> 41:46.511
<i>You have entered restricted space.</i>

41:46.545 --> 41:48.613
<i>Respond immediately
or you may be fired upon.</i>

41:48.647 --> 41:50.115
No need, no need.

41:50.149 --> 41:52.684
This the "Y Que" racer
out sa Ceres Station.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.352
<i>Your transponder is off.</i>

41:54.386 --> 41:56.287
Transponder busted, yeah?

41:56.322 --> 41:58.623
Me ballistic is all, can fire up reactor,

41:58.657 --> 42:00.058
but that take a couple minutes.

42:00.092 --> 42:01.993
<i>"Y Que," veer off, now!</i>

42:02.027 --> 42:04.863
No harm, no harm, me surrender.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.365
Just got to get slowed down a little.

42:07.399 --> 42:10.470
Firing up in a few seconds,
hold your piss.

42:12.401 --> 42:15.224
Evita, setara mi.

42:16.148 --> 42:18.516
Baby, today,

42:18.541 --> 42:20.909
I do this fo you.

42:27.686 --> 42:29.754
Olé, dusters!

42:29.789 --> 42:33.892
Today, I make history.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.827
Me!

42:35.861 --> 42:39.030
Manéo Jung-Espano...

43:10.663 --> 43:14.199
I don't remember.

43:14.233 --> 43:18.413
You just lose yourself, piece at a time.

43:18.890 --> 43:22.460
There's no laws on Ceres,

43:22.485 --> 43:23.819
just cops.
