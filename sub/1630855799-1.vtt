00:19.821 --> 00:22.891
<i>That moment in 1969</i>
<i>still haunts me.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.660
<i>Apollo 11 astronauts</i>
<i>Armstrong and Aldrin</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:27.962
<i>had strapped</i>
<i>into the lunar module Eagle</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:29.463
<i>to begin their final descent.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:33.066
<i>At the Sea of Tranquility,</i>
<i>Armstrong improvised,</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:36.203
<i>manually piloting the ship</i>
<i>past several boulders</i>

00:36.336 --> 00:38.372
<i>and avoiding certain tragedy.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.207
<i>During the final seconds,</i>

00:40.340 --> 00:42.777
<i>the Eagle's computer</i>
<i>blared alarms.</i>

00:43.076 --> 00:44.478
<i>Aldrin ignored them.</i>

00:47.314 --> 00:49.483
<i>At 4:17 p.m. EDT,</i>

00:49.617 --> 00:51.920
<i>with 30 seconds of fuel</i>
<i>remaining,</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.488
<i>Armstrong brought her home</i>
<i>and said,</i>

00:54.622 --> 00:57.825
<i>"Houston, Tranquility Base</i>
<i>here.</i>

00:58.392 --> 00:59.794
<i>The Eagle has landed."</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:13.273
<i>During the first</i>
<i>COVID spring,</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:15.142
<i>without even realizing it,</i>

01:15.275 --> 01:17.244
<i>I was counting down myself.</i>

01:17.645 --> 01:19.847
<i>Waiting for</i>
<i>the last-second heroic call</i>

01:19.981 --> 01:22.115
<i>that would shoot me</i>
<i>back to sanity.</i>

01:51.378 --> 01:52.780
Shh, shh, shh.

02:11.833 --> 02:12.967
No PowerPoint?

02:13.433 --> 02:15.637
Figured I'd use my finger.

02:17.404 --> 02:22.110
Like-- like this,
and this, and that, and...

02:22.242 --> 02:24.545
Yeah, sorry.

02:25.046 --> 02:26.346
Sorry.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.883
Yeah, um,

02:29.017 --> 02:33.286
our report is about
the bussing crisis

02:33.420 --> 02:35.690
in the old days
of s-- segregation.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.492
And hey, you know,
I actually own a bus.

02:38.626 --> 02:42.864
It's what you call it,
a perfect fit.

02:45.133 --> 02:46.901
We named it
the Magic Bus...

02:47.935 --> 02:49.070
because...

02:49.971 --> 02:53.306
magic things can happen...

02:53.440 --> 02:56.110
in, um, a...

02:56.577 --> 02:57.879
-Antonio?
-Yeah.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.748
I never-- never--
never mind, um...

03:01.816 --> 03:02.850
What were we?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.586
- Shit, uh...
- Name of the article?

03:05.720 --> 03:07.722
<i>It Was Never About Bussing.</i>

03:08.455 --> 03:09.857
We'll need your handout.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.761
Uh, yeah.

03:17.899 --> 03:19.701
Wait.
Lita, did I give it to you?

03:19.834 --> 03:21.736
-I think I gave it to you.
-Shut up, I gave it to you.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.671
-No, I can't do it.
-You've seen it all the time.

03:23.805 --> 03:25.372
Uh, one sec.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.874
I think we might have,
uh, misplaced it,

03:27.008 --> 03:28.375
or something, like...

03:28.843 --> 03:30.878
Shit.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.880
Well...

03:35.215 --> 03:36.349
It's funny.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.853
- This is funny.
- Uh, <i>uno momento.</i>

03:38.986 --> 03:40.188
I said that it was funny,

03:40.320 --> 03:41.556
not that you could have
more time.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.356
- Ooh.
- Wow.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.427
No, I'm-- look, um, okay.

03:47.562 --> 03:50.031
Let's just-- let's start over.
Let's start over.

03:50.164 --> 03:51.566
Never happened.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.802
Um, the name
of the story...

03:55.770 --> 03:56.871
is...

03:57.605 --> 03:59.941
-Goddammit, I just would--
-Yeah. We read the chapter.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.211
I know it doesn't look like it,
but we did.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.245
Um, hold-- hold, please.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.182
Maybe by some miracle,
he did give it to me--

04:08.850 --> 04:10.450
-Oh, my God, I got it.
-Oh.

04:10.585 --> 04:12.153
- <i>Lo siento,</i> we're ready.
- Good.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.855
Unfortunately, we're not.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.490
No, but-- but--
but-- we-- we read the--

04:16.624 --> 04:18.492
we read the-- the story.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.327
Which, in educated circles,
is called an article.

04:21.896 --> 04:23.030
It's nice of you.

04:23.598 --> 04:26.834
But the assignment was
to present it.

04:27.802 --> 04:29.302
And without a PowerPoint
or a handout,

04:29.436 --> 04:30.705
how are you going to do that?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.339
- We have the handout.
- Hmm.

04:33.141 --> 04:35.710
That does indicate
a level of commitment.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.879
Just not the right level.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.617
-Shit.
-Shit.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.285
Was that "shit," as in,

04:45.418 --> 04:47.555
"What an embarrassment,
shit."

04:47.688 --> 04:49.624
Or I was thinking it was,

04:49.757 --> 04:51.959
"Shit, these guys
are trying to undermine

04:52.093 --> 04:53.761
my whole class" shit.

04:53.895 --> 04:57.732
Or, "I gotta stop them before
my entire class loses its shit."

04:58.666 --> 05:00.367
No, we're not doing--
no, Mr.--

05:00.501 --> 05:01.769
Sit back down.

05:01.903 --> 05:03.271
Both of you.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.073
Mr. Cole, you can't, um...

05:06.707 --> 05:08.943
stop us from giving our report.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.646
Sure I can.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.681
I'm the professor.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.484
At my office,
after class, both of you.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.253
Next.

05:21.856 --> 05:23.090
Next.

05:23.224 --> 05:24.759
We're all fucked.

05:39.807 --> 05:43.443
We're fine.
I can't get in trouble. Okay?

05:47.582 --> 05:49.116
I'll take Lita first.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.419
Whoa, whoa.
We're not going in together?

05:53.154 --> 05:54.822
In an interrogation,
you keep people separate,

05:54.956 --> 05:56.691
so that their stories
don't match.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.892
Right?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.727
He's kidding.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.762
I think.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.497
On second thought...

06:05.132 --> 06:06.868
I'll take
your boyfriend first.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.437
-What the--
-It's fine, it's fine.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.907
Stay calm.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.407
Okay? Okay?

06:21.414 --> 06:22.683
Oh, shit.

06:50.044 --> 06:51.312
Shit, shit.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.782
Oh, my-- you fucking--

06:56.250 --> 06:57.218
What are you doing?

07:00.521 --> 07:01.555
Oy, Antonio.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.163
You people had me
chomping pencil lead again.

07:09.297 --> 07:12.166
I've been there.
It's a tough habit to break.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.672
I'm sorry.
This is serious.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.142
Do you want to explain to me,
Antonio,

07:21.275 --> 07:24.045
why you attacked Mr. Cole?

07:27.480 --> 07:28.749
First...

07:29.449 --> 07:30.718
I shouldn't have.

07:32.253 --> 07:33.554
There's no excuse.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.456
But...

07:37.058 --> 07:38.125
he...

07:40.695 --> 07:42.229
I-- I-- I--

07:42.363 --> 07:43.864
I just messed up bad.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.936
Ethan.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.906
We can still call
campus police.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.174
It's your move.

07:53.708 --> 07:55.142
It's been embarrassing enough.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.812
Do you feel safe,

07:57.945 --> 07:59.547
letting him back
in your classroom?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.481
After about
a few weeks' break, of course.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.852
What about me?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.388
What about you, what?

08:07.521 --> 08:09.724
What about me?
My-- my-- my safety?

08:10.458 --> 08:11.792
You're kidding, right?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.397
No, I'm sorry,
I'm just--

08:16.530 --> 08:18.099
I guess
I'm just being stupid today.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.269
Anyway,
I'm not coming back.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.172
- To class, I mean.
- That's not an answer.

08:25.306 --> 08:26.374
Yeah, well...

08:27.041 --> 08:29.210
I take another quiz,
I'm just gonna fail.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.315
He will be disciplined,
Ethan, but, um,

08:34.448 --> 08:36.484
maybe it's best
for everyone

08:36.616 --> 08:38.184
if we don't involve
the police.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.522
Let's just say bygones?

08:44.592 --> 08:45.693
That's a professor

08:45.826 --> 08:47.261
doing you a solid there,
Antonio.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.564
Be back here at 8 a.m. tomorrow
for a wrap-up, please.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.966
Thank you.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.810
I can't wait.

09:05.346 --> 09:06.714
We know what you mean.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.452
You in a hurry?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.954
-I have another class.
-At 12:30.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.058
Tamara.

09:17.191 --> 09:20.027
When are you going to stop
catching me at everything?

09:20.161 --> 09:23.164
When you stop looking so guilty
and start lightening up.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.133
But seriously,
how you doing?

09:26.267 --> 09:27.601
Bruises, no cuts.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.969
I can see that,

09:29.103 --> 09:30.838
but what about
what I can't see?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.640
Hey, what you can't see
can't hurt you.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.708
Oh, come on.
Nobody believes that.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.177
Yeah. True.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.345
He says "In the age
of coronavirus..."

09:38.479 --> 09:41.782
I just got out
of a two-hour meeting

09:41.916 --> 09:43.918
on all things coronavirus.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.719
It was not fun.

09:46.187 --> 09:49.090
But first things first.
How are you?

09:49.524 --> 09:51.158
I never see you these days.

09:51.292 --> 09:54.061
Oh, well, just getting jumped
by the occasional student.

09:54.195 --> 09:56.130
What is the corona update?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.632
Keeping the doors open
for now,

09:58.766 --> 10:00.502
we'll see
how things progress...

10:01.001 --> 10:03.370
Oh, did you hear about
the two full-time positions?

10:04.338 --> 10:05.606
I've heard rumblings.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.008
Just like you to figure out
the strangest way

10:08.142 --> 10:09.810
to show off
for the hiring committee.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.280
-Unless I'm not applying.
-What? Wow!

10:13.414 --> 10:14.748
For the fifth straight year?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.183
Beginning to think
you don't like us.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.052
It has nothing to do
with you guys.

10:21.556 --> 10:22.756
That's what I'm afraid of.

10:25.426 --> 10:26.494
Ethan...

10:27.361 --> 10:32.032
ever since Marie,
you have been a little...

10:33.868 --> 10:35.136
I mean...

10:36.337 --> 10:37.872
maybe a little lost?

10:38.873 --> 10:40.641
-Is there anything that--
-Yep.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.011
Lesson plans await.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.982
And I have to Google search
student uprisings

10:48.115 --> 10:49.850
and the professors
that caused them.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.586
Oh, well, I wouldn't want to
get in the way

10:51.752 --> 10:53.154
of another
good Google search.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.289
Tamara, I, um...

10:56.257 --> 10:59.660
I appreciate your understanding
in this matter.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.662
Ethan.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.797
We have your back.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.367
I just wish
I could convince you of that.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.420
"Appreciate your understanding
on this matter."

11:27.888 --> 11:29.156
Jesus.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.059
I call it a matter.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.684
<i>Got your plowman,</i>

11:55.816 --> 11:58.118
<i>your fisherman,</i>
<i>your shepherd.</i>

12:00.054 --> 12:02.389
<i>And your soggy prince,</i>
<i>Icarus.</i>

12:02.923 --> 12:05.159
<i>They're off</i>
<i>in the painting's right corner.</i>

12:05.726 --> 12:07.529
<i>His thrashing legs, anyway.</i>

12:08.597 --> 12:11.465
<i>Maybe I'm Icarus,</i>
<i>the self-centered god,</i>

12:11.600 --> 12:13.200
<i>who flies</i>
<i>too close to the sun,</i>

12:13.334 --> 12:15.236
<i>and drowns while the plowman,</i>

12:15.369 --> 12:18.005
<i>the fisherman,</i>
<i>and the ship's sailors</i>

12:18.138 --> 12:19.406
<i>go about their business.</i>

12:22.743 --> 12:24.579
Oh, uh--

12:24.713 --> 12:26.080
Hi, Tamara. Um...

12:26.213 --> 12:27.881
<i>Ethan?</i>
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

12:28.015 --> 12:29.383
Yeah, um, look,

12:29.517 --> 12:31.151
- I'm sorry about the--
<i>- No.</i>

12:31.285 --> 12:33.020
<i>-I'm not calling about that.</i>
-Mmm. Okay.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.623
<i>So then,</i>
<i>there's a campus shutdown</i>

12:34.755 --> 12:36.390
<i>-as of 6 p.m. Tonight.</i>
-No...

12:36.524 --> 12:38.693
<i>Remote instruction,</i>
<i>until we hear otherwise.</i>

12:38.826 --> 12:40.194
Well, a remote instruction

12:40.327 --> 12:41.996
sounds kind of like
an oxymoron, doesn't it?

12:42.129 --> 12:43.897
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.799
<i>It's about the only</i>
<i>choice we have, you know?</i>

12:45.933 --> 12:47.201
Only way to land the plane.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.036
- I understand.
<i>- Sorry.</i>

12:49.169 --> 12:50.938
<i>This is really going to</i>
<i>alter your syllabus.</i>

12:51.071 --> 12:53.140
Yeah.
Curriculum changes ahead.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.109
<i>We're finishing up</i>
<i>some best practices.</i>

12:55.242 --> 12:57.646
<i>-I was just thinking--</i>
-Yeah, I'll check my email.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.846
- <i>Yeah, please.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.481
<i>Ethan, let us know</i>

13:00.615 --> 13:01.815
<i>if there's anything else</i>
<i>we can do for you.</i>

13:01.949 --> 13:03.350
Same to you, um...

13:03.484 --> 13:05.052
<i>Well.</i>
<i>I think that's about it.</i>

13:05.185 --> 13:06.954
- Yeah.
<i>- Stay safe, my friend.</i>

13:07.087 --> 13:08.355
Yeah, take care.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.463
Fuck.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.604
<i>Coronavirus</i>
<i>is overwhelming every hospital.</i>

13:22.737 --> 13:25.339
<i>Another</i>
<i>46 people have died from it.</i>

13:25.472 --> 13:28.008
<i>This is a serious</i>
<i>health situation in China.</i>

13:28.142 --> 13:29.678
<i>As the wave of sickness</i>

13:29.810 --> 13:32.112
<i>appears to be following</i>
<i>the grim predictions.</i>

13:32.246 --> 13:33.515
<i>The pandemic...</i>

13:34.415 --> 13:37.017
<i>was the strangest</i>
<i>Mad Hatter ride.</i>

13:38.118 --> 13:40.487
<i>Maybe the apt metaphor</i>
<i>is water-based.</i>

13:40.622 --> 13:43.591
<i>Teachers were lost</i>
<i>on rapids of online education,</i>

13:43.725 --> 13:47.161
<i>drowning in computer graphics,</i>
<i>rethinking...</i>

13:48.495 --> 13:49.597
<i>everything.</i>

13:51.666 --> 13:52.933
<i>Wait.</i>

13:54.602 --> 13:58.540
<i>Houston,</i>
<i>an idea finally landed.</i>

14:09.116 --> 14:11.553
<i>Mr. Cole!</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

14:11.686 --> 14:14.121
Okay, so, Apollo.

14:14.622 --> 14:15.956
What was it about?

14:16.090 --> 14:17.525
I feel like
this is a trick question,

14:17.659 --> 14:18.992
but, uh, I'll play.

14:19.493 --> 14:21.962
<i>Landing on the Moon</i>
<i>for 500, Alex.</i>

14:22.096 --> 14:24.331
<i>-Um, Ethan.</i>
-Yes. No, no.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.999
I-- I mean
more than that.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.535
I mean, obviously,
the program's legacy

14:27.669 --> 14:29.136
- is all tied up in--
<i>- Careful.</i>

14:29.269 --> 14:30.871
I feel my feet
leaving the floorboards.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.508
It's tied up
in our legacy

14:33.641 --> 14:35.075
of can-do spirit.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.512
We set out to achieve
an outlandish goal,

14:37.645 --> 14:39.346
and we achieved it.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.048
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>we're about to do.</i>

14:41.181 --> 14:42.983
Achieve a national goal,
or land on the Moon?

14:43.117 --> 14:45.486
<i>Achieve a goal</i>
<i>with the pandemic.</i>

14:46.220 --> 14:48.222
Got it.
No, I completely lost it.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.023
I'm like, Kanye West
levels of confused here.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.526
All right.

14:51.659 --> 14:53.227
When America is faced
with a challenge,

14:53.360 --> 14:55.396
- what do we do?
<i>- Ethan.</i>

14:55.530 --> 14:57.866
<i>Can I get the Concise Epiphany</i>
<i>for Dummies version of this?</i>

14:57.998 --> 14:59.500
<i>I'm busy.</i>

14:59.634 --> 15:01.001
Uh, rewriting
my entire semester's <i>syllabus,</i>

15:01.135 --> 15:02.637
<i>just like everybody else.</i>

15:03.237 --> 15:07.141
What is the real history
of this country?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.209
Oh, do you mean the one

15:09.343 --> 15:11.178
with the friendly
Native Americans who've got

15:11.311 --> 15:12.946
the colorful headdresses
and they helped serve

15:13.080 --> 15:15.048
the Thanksgiving stuffing
piping hot?

15:15.182 --> 15:18.820
<i>-Or the one that--</i>
-No, we show up.

15:19.721 --> 15:21.589
When we are faced
with a challenge,

15:21.723 --> 15:23.758
we solve it.

15:23.892 --> 15:25.292
<i>I mean, we've covering</i>

15:25.426 --> 15:26.994
<i>the late 20th century</i>
<i>history anyway.</i>

15:27.127 --> 15:29.531
So, why not focus
on the Apollo program?

15:29.664 --> 15:32.065
That's what I'm gonna do for
the remainder of the semester.

15:32.634 --> 15:34.334
While still covering
the essential elements

15:34.468 --> 15:35.870
of late
20th century history?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.304
With my eyes closed.

15:37.438 --> 15:39.507
Now-- now, I mean, you know--

15:39.641 --> 15:43.076
'Kay. Eyes closed.
Open, wide shut. Whatever.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.747
I have faith in you, E-man.
Go to town. Bye.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.114
Thank you, bye.

15:57.559 --> 15:59.828
<i>In 500 years,</i>
<i>the 20th century</i>

15:59.960 --> 16:02.963
<i>will be remembered</i>
<i>for space exploration.</i>

16:03.397 --> 16:06.935
<i>Basically, the Apollo 11</i>
<i>Moon landing has no peers.</i>

16:07.502 --> 16:10.437
<i>It was and is astonishing,</i>
<i>that we have forgotten</i>

16:10.572 --> 16:12.674
<i>what a wild roll</i>
<i>of the dice it was.</i>

16:13.173 --> 16:17.110
<i>We didn't have the equipment,</i>
<i>the technology, or the men.</i>

16:17.244 --> 16:19.213
<i>We were unprepared</i>
<i>on almost every level</i>

16:19.346 --> 16:21.415
<i>when the mission called,</i>
<i>asking everything</i>

16:21.549 --> 16:24.719
<i>and offering not one single</i>
<i>guarantee of success.</i>

16:25.118 --> 16:29.557
<i>Regardless, we dug down deep,</i>
<i>ignored every fear,</i>

16:29.691 --> 16:33.026
<i>and shot past every failure</i>
<i>into orbit.</i>

16:35.229 --> 16:36.798
<i>This is our track record.</i>

16:37.197 --> 16:39.299
<i>We win</i>
<i>when the chips are down.</i>

16:41.134 --> 16:42.704
<i>And this semester</i>
<i>will remind us</i>

16:42.837 --> 16:46.139
<i>that big challenges</i>
<i>are second nature to Americans.</i>

16:47.307 --> 16:48.643
<i>Students,</i>

16:48.776 --> 16:51.078
<i>lofty aspirations</i>
<i>are what we do,</i>

16:51.211 --> 16:55.115
<i>even when the goal lies</i>
<i>across time and space itself.</i>

16:57.251 --> 16:58.586
All right, that's it.

16:59.587 --> 17:01.288
That's a start.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.991
<i>For the first</i>
<i>time,</i>
<i>three Americans rode</i>

17:03.123 --> 17:04.858
<i>the Saturn 5 Moon rocket.</i>

17:27.615 --> 17:29.684
-Whoa.
-Hey. Hey, Mr. Cole.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.986
What in the wild
flying fuck of a world

17:32.119 --> 17:33.387
are you doing here?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.623
I see you still got
your way with words, Mister.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.125
-Look, I just came here to talk.
-You don't have a mask.

17:38.793 --> 17:41.328
-All right?
-Okay. Okay, one sec. One--

17:45.432 --> 17:48.068
Jesus.
You shouldn't be here!

17:48.903 --> 17:50.270
Look, I know this isn't cool.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.040
That doesn't even
begin to start.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.008
Leave now
and we won't have to--

17:54.141 --> 17:55.643
Look, I get it,
I get it, okay?

17:55.777 --> 17:57.444
You-- it's, like,
the second time you've decided

17:57.579 --> 17:59.146
whether or not you want to
call the cops on me?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.281
Yeah, and that's two times
way too many.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.722
M-- Mr. Cole.

18:08.322 --> 18:09.824
I'm not here
to do anything bad.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.258
Okay?

18:12.259 --> 18:13.595
I'm not that kind of guy.

18:14.562 --> 18:15.830
And I think you know that.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.800
I know that you jumped me.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.836
That's right.

18:22.704 --> 18:24.137
But it ain't that simple,
is it?

18:24.739 --> 18:26.841
How did you find out
where I live?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.276
Well, in the days
of Google Maps search,

18:29.409 --> 18:30.979
ain't that hard.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.146
All right, this time,
I am calling the cops,

18:33.280 --> 18:34.749
-All right?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

18:34.882 --> 18:36.584
Okay. I get it.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.820
If that's what
you want to do...

18:39.887 --> 18:41.154
you'll do it.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.426
Quit saying that.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.129
-Saying what?
-"I get it."

18:49.262 --> 18:50.632
You don't get it, okay?

18:55.003 --> 18:56.104
What?

18:56.771 --> 18:58.840
- What?
- What do you want?

19:00.742 --> 19:03.176
Mr. Cole, I want to know
if I should drop the class.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.920
That's what emails are for.

19:13.955 --> 19:16.356
-I guess that's true.
-That is true.

19:19.127 --> 19:20.662
But what about
the other thing?

19:22.630 --> 19:24.431
The presentation malpractice?

19:27.068 --> 19:28.335
No.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.672
In the office.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.674
Between me and you.

19:33.741 --> 19:35.576
What happened
and what was said?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.981
You want to start
makin' sense at any time,

19:40.114 --> 19:41.248
you go right ahead.

19:41.883 --> 19:44.519
Oh, but no big deal, I'm just--

19:44.652 --> 19:47.555
hangin' out here with the guy
who slammed me into the ground.

19:47.689 --> 19:48.556
No big.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.859
But, you know,
I've got a class to teach, so...

19:53.061 --> 19:54.327
So...

19:55.362 --> 19:56.831
I should probably
just drop, then?

19:59.767 --> 20:02.904
Listen, I'm just
surprised that you--

20:03.336 --> 20:05.873
-I'm surprised.
-Yeah. I-- I-- I get it.

20:07.909 --> 20:09.443
Sorry, I said it again.

20:10.812 --> 20:13.681
I'm sorry
that I'm surprising you.

20:15.516 --> 20:16.718
Is this really
all you're here for,

20:16.851 --> 20:18.186
to decide
if you should drop?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.594
Is that a difficult question?

20:30.131 --> 20:31.398
That's why I'm here.

20:36.170 --> 20:37.437
Good.

20:43.044 --> 20:44.512
Look, you gotta understand.

20:44.645 --> 20:47.548
As a teacher,
I want what's best for you.

20:48.049 --> 20:49.316
Okay?

20:50.051 --> 20:51.919
So, this...

20:55.022 --> 20:58.726
this is a matter I'm gonna
leave to your better judgment.

21:07.802 --> 21:08.970
I'm gonna drop.

21:12.707 --> 21:14.307
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.545
Yeah, I bet you are.

21:18.012 --> 21:19.479
What's that?

21:22.382 --> 21:24.652
-You don't--
-You know, Mr. Cole...

21:26.319 --> 21:27.487
I'm sorry I came here.

21:27.989 --> 21:30.290
You're more than six feet,
it's fine.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.460
- But don't--
- I know.

21:33.828 --> 21:34.962
Don't come back.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.466
Fuck.

22:15.036 --> 22:18.906
<i>A waxing crescent,</i>
<i>little less than half.</i>

22:19.406 --> 22:21.909
<i>25% illumination.</i>

22:22.710 --> 22:25.580
<i>Mysterious one tonight.</i>

22:32.086 --> 22:33.321
<i>I should tell him.</i>

22:35.089 --> 22:36.356
<i>When he wakes up.</i>

22:37.825 --> 22:39.527
<i>Probably won't, though.</i>

22:57.578 --> 22:59.213
Uh, <i>chica?</i>

22:59.347 --> 23:02.783
Sorry, just doing homework.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.886
No.

23:05.019 --> 23:07.755
- No?
- Mm-mmm.

23:07.889 --> 23:10.258
Babe, you're jackhammering
my skull.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.195
Oh, Antonio, you sweet boy.

23:14.629 --> 23:16.429
Where is the big
jackhammer hitting?

23:17.131 --> 23:19.000
Well, for starters...

23:20.034 --> 23:21.235
right here.

23:21.369 --> 23:23.704
Over here?

23:23.838 --> 23:25.606
Actually, right here.

23:26.007 --> 23:28.009
Oh, right here?

23:28.142 --> 23:31.545
- Yes.
- Quit, quit.

23:32.513 --> 23:34.348
Are you cured,
or should I call the hospital?

23:34.481 --> 23:37.718
Babe, papers on
the first day of Spring Break?

23:38.185 --> 23:39.320
What's the first rule?

23:39.720 --> 23:42.556
Uh, first rule
of Spring Break...

23:43.157 --> 23:45.092
-no typing?
-Mm-mmm.

23:45.526 --> 23:47.161
No...

23:47.295 --> 23:49.196
-jackhammering?
-Mmm, no.

23:49.664 --> 23:51.098
No homework.

23:51.632 --> 23:53.134
I know, I know.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.467
Just a conclusion
to go with this history paper.

23:55.202 --> 23:58.005
And then after that,
we can do whatever you want.

23:58.539 --> 24:00.207
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.210
-What--
-What?

24:03.878 --> 24:05.846
Please tell me you're not
writing for that <i>stupido.</i>

24:07.114 --> 24:09.216
Forget it, I was just
killing time until you got up.

24:09.350 --> 24:10.584
Okay? Are you up?

24:10.718 --> 24:12.485
Well, don't play
that shit with me, babe.

24:13.087 --> 24:14.889
-Who's playing?
-You-- Cole's class.

24:15.022 --> 24:16.489
I thought
you were gonna drop.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.960
One of us
has to stay in school.

24:19.961 --> 24:21.729
You're gonna let
that big white dickhead,

24:21.862 --> 24:23.764
who made me tackle him,
teach you.

24:24.198 --> 24:27.001
Remind me again
how he made you tackle him?

24:29.904 --> 24:31.305
You know what,
never mind.

24:31.439 --> 24:32.740
Antonio. It's remote.

24:32.873 --> 24:34.608
I don't even
have to see him.

24:34.742 --> 24:36.110
And what is he teaching now?
Huh?

24:36.243 --> 24:37.912
Let me guess, what is he doing,
what's the word?

24:38.045 --> 24:40.214
How to be,
what, come on.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.782
That one single word?

24:41.916 --> 24:43.651
That one
out of a million others?

24:43.784 --> 24:45.453
So, fill in the blank,
you're the smart one.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.655
He's teaching privilege.

24:47.788 --> 24:49.623
White privilege.

24:49.757 --> 24:51.559
Right, just like
all the other white teachers.

24:51.692 --> 24:53.294
Drop his class!

24:53.427 --> 24:54.695
Final!

25:00.234 --> 25:03.637
Antonio. That's not fair.
Don't ask me to.

25:10.811 --> 25:13.014
Wow. Okay.
All right, you know what?

25:13.147 --> 25:14.582
I'm out of here, then.
Forget it.

25:14.949 --> 25:17.151
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I'm leavin'.

25:18.452 --> 25:19.954
You're acting like a child.

25:20.087 --> 25:22.490
- Yeah, bitch.
- Whatever, leave then.

25:22.623 --> 25:23.657
Well, I'm going.

25:35.236 --> 25:36.871
You know what,
on second thought...

25:37.605 --> 25:39.140
I'm gonna let you
make it up to me.

25:42.543 --> 25:43.978
Oh, really?

25:45.613 --> 25:46.881
Yeah.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.050
It is Spring Break, and...

25:49.183 --> 25:51.719
...you're gonna
need these clothes.

25:51.852 --> 25:53.254
- Hey.
- That clothes, that one...

25:53.387 --> 25:55.156
- And yeah-- that one.
- Wait.

25:55.289 --> 25:56.991
You better be nice to me,
or I'm not gonna take you.

25:57.124 --> 25:59.093
Shut up, it's coronavirus.
We can't go anywhere.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.861
And these are your clothes,
not mine!

26:00.995 --> 26:02.531
You wear my clothes
all the time, <i>chica.</i>

26:02.663 --> 26:03.831
-Stop it!
-What are you talkin' about?

26:06.200 --> 26:08.069
-We're goin' to San Diego.
-No, Antonio.

26:08.202 --> 26:10.204
Nobody's lis--
hear me out, please.

26:12.573 --> 26:13.908
You haven't met
my homies there yet.

26:14.308 --> 26:16.811
Oh, my God, if they're anything
like your friends here...

26:17.411 --> 26:19.080
What? What?

26:19.713 --> 26:22.316
You know,
is it even safe to go out?

26:23.518 --> 26:25.719
You think I would take you
somewhere that's not safe?

26:26.754 --> 26:27.988
Hmm?

26:29.924 --> 26:31.392
My best friend, D'Andre...

26:31.792 --> 26:33.360
he's got this garage
we can stay at.

26:33.861 --> 26:36.163
He's got a great crash pad
by the beach.

26:36.897 --> 26:37.965
It's beautiful.

26:38.432 --> 26:41.570
We can jump in the water,
we can surf,

26:41.702 --> 26:42.770
just you and me.

26:43.404 --> 26:45.172
And just get out of here,
you know,

26:45.306 --> 26:47.174
just forget
all this bullshit for a while.

26:48.577 --> 26:49.977
I think
it'd be good for us.

26:50.744 --> 26:52.313
And I want you
to meet my friends.

26:53.047 --> 26:54.315
They're like my family.

26:55.249 --> 26:56.317
For real.

26:59.487 --> 27:02.056
Okay. Then I want to.

27:02.823 --> 27:04.024
You better.

27:04.425 --> 27:06.660
And you'll quit bugging me
about taking this class?

27:07.161 --> 27:08.762
It's really not that bad,

27:08.896 --> 27:10.865
he's focusing on
the Apollo Moon landing a lot.

27:10.998 --> 27:12.666
That's what
my research paper's on.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.103
No wonder that's
your favorite subject, huh?

27:16.737 --> 27:18.005
Moonface.

27:20.774 --> 27:22.309
All right,
go get dressed.

27:48.570 --> 27:52.273
<i>This girl, she reminds me...</i>

27:52.940 --> 27:55.709
<i>slow down.</i>

27:56.076 --> 27:57.678
<i>But I only know fast.</i>

27:58.479 --> 28:02.449
<i>She's trying to teach me</i>
<i>her different way.</i>

28:02.950 --> 28:04.218
<i>I think...</i>

28:05.554 --> 28:06.521
<i>I love her.</i>

28:06.655 --> 28:07.988
<i>That...</i>

28:08.856 --> 28:10.224
<i>worth a try.</i>

28:14.563 --> 28:16.764
<i>Our channel</i>
<i>breaks the news here.</i>

28:32.913 --> 28:34.982
Hey, all right, everybody.

28:36.884 --> 28:38.385
Bro, let's go.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.820
Yo, it's a party,
you'll let me get my thing on.

28:39.954 --> 28:41.288
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:41.422 --> 28:42.524
Cheers.

28:43.090 --> 28:44.825
Ah, thank you.

28:46.595 --> 28:49.029
Yeah.
No more for him, he's cut off!

28:49.664 --> 28:52.266
No, no, no, but seriously.
Nah, we were cool.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.001
This guy was stressin'
on D'Andre.

28:54.134 --> 28:56.337
Again.
They always are, man.

28:56.470 --> 28:58.472
Yeah, no, tell the story.
What happened?

28:58.607 --> 28:59.840
I got nothin' but love.

28:59.974 --> 29:01.475
Oh, my God. Love?

29:01.610 --> 29:03.511
I keep tellin' him,
that ain't this year's plan.

29:03.645 --> 29:04.679
It just ain't.

29:04.812 --> 29:06.413
Do you know why?

29:06.548 --> 29:08.516
'Cause this man right here,
he's from another country.

29:08.650 --> 29:11.085
Aye, man.

29:11.653 --> 29:12.721
Not a country.

29:12.853 --> 29:14.455
Oh, my God.

29:14.589 --> 29:17.258
You hear this? People shit on
fool, he just smiles.

29:17.391 --> 29:18.892
What is that?

29:19.026 --> 29:20.094
It's like your mama
took care of him, some shit.

29:20.227 --> 29:21.529
Hey, hey.

29:22.796 --> 29:23.797
She did.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.234
Wait, wait.

29:27.368 --> 29:29.303
And that's, like,
a bad thing?

29:29.436 --> 29:31.673
Uh, look, it-- it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

29:31.805 --> 29:33.608
You know,
except for when they...

29:34.375 --> 29:36.343
-when they try to...
-Oh, hell no.

29:36.477 --> 29:37.978
Oh, look, it's on,
do it, De, come on.

29:38.112 --> 29:39.446
Come on, man,
not this shit again.

29:41.181 --> 29:43.384
I'mma fuck you up.

29:43.518 --> 29:45.019
Fuck this up, it's up.

29:45.152 --> 29:47.955
When-- when-- when they try
to take my rabbits.

29:49.290 --> 29:51.158
Oh, no, the deep--

29:51.292 --> 29:53.027
- No, don't do it.
- Wait, what is it, what is it?

29:53.160 --> 29:54.562
Don't ask, baby, please.

29:54.696 --> 29:55.963
- No, come on, just...
- Shut up, eh?

29:57.532 --> 29:58.600
We're gonna...

29:59.300 --> 30:01.670
we're gonna get a little place,
and we're gonna--

30:01.802 --> 30:05.172
we're gonna get a little place,
a-- and we're gonna--

30:05.306 --> 30:07.007
He's so stupid.

30:07.141 --> 30:08.475
Is he stupid?

30:08.610 --> 30:10.444
Little bit,
it's a little bit.

30:17.151 --> 30:19.353
We're goin' to get
a little place,

30:19.486 --> 30:22.590
a-- and Jamal says
we're gonna have pigs

30:22.724 --> 30:24.358
and-- and chickens,

30:24.491 --> 30:28.028
and you better not forget about
the alfalfa for my rabbits.

30:28.162 --> 30:30.397
-No, no, no.
-Oh, I can--

30:30.532 --> 30:33.067
I can see it now.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.936
I can see it
right across the river.

30:36.070 --> 30:37.471
Ah!

30:37.605 --> 30:40.107
Jamal says
everybody's gonna be nice to me.

30:40.575 --> 30:42.343
There ain't gonna be
no more trouble.

30:42.910 --> 30:46.246
Oh, Jamal, can we go now?
I don't want no more trouble.

30:46.380 --> 30:47.515
No.

30:47.649 --> 30:50.117
So, what is the question again?

30:51.051 --> 30:54.656
"To be or not to be."

30:54.789 --> 30:57.257
- Dun, dun, dun.
- That is the question.

30:57.391 --> 31:01.763
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind of

31:01.895 --> 31:07.000
to suffer the slings
and arrow of rage's fortune,

31:07.134 --> 31:10.404
or to take his rabbits

31:10.538 --> 31:12.072
to a sea of alfalfa,

31:12.206 --> 31:13.675
and plow a pasture

31:13.808 --> 31:17.545
against everybody
ain't gonna be nice to him.

31:18.879 --> 31:22.416
If to die,
to sleep no more...

31:22.916 --> 31:24.786
and by sleeping say...

31:25.352 --> 31:27.354
There ain't gonna be
no more trouble."

31:27.488 --> 31:28.556
No, sir.

31:28.690 --> 31:31.559
"And therefore
end the heartache,

31:31.693 --> 31:37.064
and a thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to."

31:39.667 --> 31:42.302
"In other words, should I,

31:42.436 --> 31:45.005
the first Black

31:45.139 --> 31:47.441
Lenny Hamlet,

31:47.575 --> 31:50.411
take them rabbits
and go across the river,

31:50.545 --> 31:54.381
and just wait here and get shot
in the back of your head?"

31:54.516 --> 31:56.551
Oh!

31:56.684 --> 31:59.953
"To be, or not to be,
a rabbit on Earth?

32:00.087 --> 32:01.989
That is the question."

32:04.391 --> 32:05.993
I don't get
why it's so damn funny.

32:06.126 --> 32:08.362
It's funny,
because my man here is funny.

32:08.495 --> 32:10.532
'Cause he blended it together
from a book and a play.

32:11.031 --> 32:14.067
You know, <i>Of Mice and Men</i>
with a little <i>Hamlet</i> mixer.

32:14.201 --> 32:15.469
Okay.

32:15.603 --> 32:16.671
Steinbeck and Shakespeare...

32:17.672 --> 32:19.006
That's wild.

32:20.174 --> 32:21.609
Lookit, my girlfriend's smart.

32:21.743 --> 32:23.444
Stage calls you, my bro.

32:24.111 --> 32:25.580
No, but seriously...

32:26.480 --> 32:28.348
I don't know, though,
out in the real world,

32:28.482 --> 32:30.050
-it might not fly.
-Ah.

32:30.685 --> 32:34.756
Fuck carrying a gun,
now it's love and acting?

32:35.557 --> 32:38.025
That shit'd get you stone cold
stomped out around here.

32:39.561 --> 32:41.328
That's why I hang out
with you dopes.

32:41.462 --> 32:42.864
Hey, I'm going to get
cold ones.

32:42.996 --> 32:44.364
- Call it.
- Yup. Yup.

32:44.498 --> 32:46.634
- Hey. Let's go.
- Shots, shots.

32:49.403 --> 32:51.706
Man, De can only do
some shit like that, huh?

33:09.223 --> 33:11.425
My mom never
let me smoke inside.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.632
Boys were,
uh, playing poker.

33:18.198 --> 33:19.466
I hate cards.

33:24.137 --> 33:25.405
So, uh...

33:25.974 --> 33:27.307
you get hassled a lot?

33:28.442 --> 33:30.745
I don't see how anyone
would have a problem with you.

33:33.781 --> 33:35.148
They all want me.

33:36.416 --> 33:39.052
And by that, I mean
that they all wanna kill me.

33:39.419 --> 33:40.889
You know,

33:41.054 --> 33:43.457
these guys were hardasses
until I made 'em laugh.

33:43.992 --> 33:45.760
Use your humor
to relax people.

33:46.360 --> 33:51.098
People have these stories
built up in their heads.

33:51.933 --> 33:54.401
It's the most
dangerous thing in the world.

33:55.135 --> 33:56.403
What is?

33:56.804 --> 33:58.071
A bad story.

33:58.873 --> 34:01.643
They see a Black guy...

34:02.409 --> 34:04.378
they-- they got stories.

34:05.112 --> 34:06.413
Most are bullshit.

34:07.314 --> 34:08.482
But you show 'em different.

34:08.616 --> 34:10.552
Oh, I don't know about that.

34:11.953 --> 34:15.023
When I perform, it--
it's like I'm trying to find

34:15.188 --> 34:17.692
the place
where people are...

34:18.659 --> 34:19.527
better.

34:19.928 --> 34:23.297
And if they let me,
I work from there.

34:23.831 --> 34:25.800
I'm searching
for that spot, too.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.804
I, um-- do this thing,

34:29.938 --> 34:32.574
when people get wound too tight,
in Monterey Park.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.112
I love it.

34:39.714 --> 34:41.616
It just, you know,
reminds people--

34:41.748 --> 34:43.685
We're all
in the same city.

34:45.587 --> 34:48.288
-In the same country.
-In the same world.

34:49.556 --> 34:50.658
Exactly.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.092
Look, maybe you'll catch this.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.464
Saw this movie the other day
called <i>Matewan,</i>

34:57.599 --> 35:01.069
about this town in
the Appalachians in the 1920s.

35:01.636 --> 35:05.205
It's this, uh,
coal strike goes down.

35:06.074 --> 35:09.209
This grinch-ass coal company

35:09.343 --> 35:10.979
puts the, uh,

35:11.111 --> 35:15.650
whites, Italians and Blacks
against each other.

35:16.517 --> 35:18.886
Uh, the plan is to get 'em
to hate each other

35:19.020 --> 35:20.153
to grow business.

35:20.788 --> 35:23.625
Towards the end,
they-- they get smart.

35:24.257 --> 35:26.159
They realize
that they share the fight.

35:26.828 --> 35:30.732
I think that's the message
that needs to get sent.

35:33.668 --> 35:35.503
We're all living
in the same city...

35:36.269 --> 35:37.872
under the same sky, but...

35:38.640 --> 35:40.575
most of the time,
you wouldn't even know it.

35:41.042 --> 35:42.510
They don't want us to.

35:45.345 --> 35:46.648
My plan...

35:47.782 --> 35:49.651
to get people
to see that...

35:50.417 --> 35:52.654
it's all one thing.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.589
Living.

35:56.724 --> 35:58.726
It sounds so...

35:58.860 --> 36:00.394
Sounds good.

36:04.799 --> 36:06.199
Like your house.

36:07.434 --> 36:10.772
It's a thrasher.

36:11.405 --> 36:14.174
But to me, it's a mansion.

36:15.475 --> 36:17.879
My pops left it to me
when he died.

36:19.013 --> 36:21.181
My mom and dad died,

36:21.314 --> 36:23.885
and these guys
became my second family.

36:25.119 --> 36:26.754
This is our home.

36:28.288 --> 36:29.624
What about you?

36:31.726 --> 36:32.794
Me?

36:33.161 --> 36:34.829
I'm-- I'm good.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.397
Nah.

36:38.465 --> 36:40.034
Somethin' else.

36:40.601 --> 36:43.504
The way you catch
all my crap

36:43.638 --> 36:45.940
means somethin' pulled you
out of orbit, too.

36:49.110 --> 36:50.377
I mean--

36:51.946 --> 36:54.716
you mean what, family?

36:55.950 --> 36:58.251
Sure. What happened?

37:00.353 --> 37:01.622
I, uh...

37:03.124 --> 37:04.391
just...

37:05.193 --> 37:07.294
it's hard to...

37:08.295 --> 37:09.731
You don't talk about it.

37:09.864 --> 37:11.331
Not really, no.

37:12.466 --> 37:16.236
Well, if my fight
is your fight,

37:16.369 --> 37:17.905
then maybe you should.

37:20.273 --> 37:21.976
Okay, um...

37:23.343 --> 37:24.979
okay.

37:25.113 --> 37:27.915
Uh, it was years ago.

37:28.950 --> 37:30.084
We, uh...

37:30.651 --> 37:32.920
my brother, my dad and I...

37:34.021 --> 37:36.389
we were crossing...

37:37.225 --> 37:38.793
and it, uh...

37:40.828 --> 37:43.798
didn't go right.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.601
Crossed the border?

37:47.969 --> 37:50.403
Yeah. In the big river.

37:51.371 --> 37:53.040
The Rio Grande.

37:55.375 --> 37:56.644
That's the one.

37:58.146 --> 37:59.213
Lost them?

38:03.084 --> 38:04.351
Yeah.

38:05.153 --> 38:07.522
Follow its current.

38:07.889 --> 38:10.423
Grows cold,
sometimes, like...

38:11.993 --> 38:13.928
pandemic cold.

38:16.463 --> 38:20.400
You've got
Antonio now, a-- and...

38:21.269 --> 38:22.537
...us.

38:24.172 --> 38:25.773
New phase, new days.

38:28.509 --> 38:30.111
I'm sorry about your parents.

38:30.778 --> 38:32.312
Everyone's battling.

38:39.921 --> 38:41.289
Babe.

38:42.223 --> 38:44.926
Are you ready
to Road Warrior?

38:45.059 --> 38:46.527
What?

38:47.460 --> 38:49.831
Our boy Luke has a bar
that still pours.

38:49.964 --> 38:51.766
I mean,
they'd probably serve us, but...

38:51.899 --> 38:54.268
Party time, D'Andre, baby!

38:54.401 --> 38:55.603
Yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

38:55.736 --> 38:57.071
What-- what place
is this, y'all?

38:57.205 --> 38:58.639
Y'all didn't tell me
about any places.

38:58.773 --> 39:00.274
The Ale--
The Ale's on K Street.

39:00.407 --> 39:01.676
- K Street.
- Ah, that place

39:01.809 --> 39:03.244
is where you go
if you tryin' to solo.

39:03.376 --> 39:04.645
That place
is filled with fools.

39:04.779 --> 39:05.880
- What?
- Exactly.

39:06.013 --> 39:07.114
Then we'll fit right in.

39:07.582 --> 39:11.152
Wait.
They're open during a pandemic?

39:11.686 --> 39:12.887
A lot of places are.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.755
A lot of stupid places.

39:14.889 --> 39:17.357
-Who you callin' stupid?
-Huh?

39:18.059 --> 39:19.093
Whoa!

39:23.698 --> 39:24.832
Kay, we'll get started...

39:24.966 --> 39:26.200
Don't get it,
I don't care...

39:26.334 --> 39:27.568
I got a picture of it, sure.

39:32.306 --> 39:34.407
- Damn, well, you get it.
- I still get you, though.

39:34.542 --> 39:36.143
I step from
out of this, period.

39:51.659 --> 39:53.094
<i>Half moon.</i>

39:53.861 --> 39:56.230
<i>50% illumination.</i>

39:56.731 --> 39:58.065
<i>Middle ground.</i>

39:59.233 --> 40:03.104
<i>Where you get tired</i>
<i>of doing the smart thing.</i>

40:32.266 --> 40:33.834
<i>Goddammit! I--</i>

40:33.968 --> 40:35.770
<i>And hello to you, too, Mr.</i>
<i>Cole.</i>

40:35.903 --> 40:38.039
Just over half the students
took the frickin' midterm.

40:38.172 --> 40:39.974
Well, did you email
them on Canvas?

40:40.107 --> 40:41.242
<i>Every last one!</i>

40:41.375 --> 40:43.010
Then you've done
all you can do.

40:43.144 --> 40:45.246
What, we're just gonna wash
our hands of the whole semester?

40:45.379 --> 40:47.048
Of course not.

40:47.181 --> 40:48.916
<i>Well, it sounded like</i>
<i>what you were implying.</i>

40:50.418 --> 40:53.387
- Ethan, are you okay?
<i>- I'm doing my job.</i>

40:53.521 --> 40:57.058
What is it gonna take to get
these students interested?

40:57.191 --> 40:58.726
<i>Ethan.</i>

40:58.859 --> 41:00.094
<i>There is a lot going on</i>
<i>in the world right now.</i>

41:00.227 --> 41:01.829
Yeah,
and I'm trying to show up.

41:01.963 --> 41:03.564
-We all are.
<i>-We had enough trouble</i>

41:03.698 --> 41:05.099
with people
showing up beforehand.

41:05.232 --> 41:06.534
God only knows
what the world's gonna look like

41:06.667 --> 41:08.569
when this horror is over!

41:11.872 --> 41:12.940
Wow.

41:14.275 --> 41:16.610
That was really dark, Ethan.

41:21.315 --> 41:23.818
Well, okay. Okay.

41:26.387 --> 41:27.888
I'm sorry.

41:28.823 --> 41:30.124
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

41:31.425 --> 41:32.693
Look, um,

41:32.827 --> 41:34.428
maybe the Moon mission
will hit big

41:34.562 --> 41:36.197
after the pandemic is over.

41:36.630 --> 41:38.132
I mean,
we're all struggling, right?

41:38.866 --> 41:41.969
<i>You and me.</i>
<i>Your students.</i>

41:42.837 --> 41:44.805
<i>Hey, that kid,</i>
<i>Antonio, he dropped, right?</i>

41:44.939 --> 41:46.741
Tamara, I'm sor-- I-- I'm--

41:46.874 --> 41:48.909
<i>I have another call I have to--</i>
<i>I have to-- thank you.</i>

42:05.092 --> 42:06.394
<i>It is</i>.

42:06.827 --> 42:09.130
<i>Sounds impressive.</i>

42:09.263 --> 42:12.900
<i>It's, um-- it's--</i>
<i>it's a window!</i>

42:16.003 --> 42:18.539
-Okay.
<i>-I love it, it's beautiful.</i>

42:18.672 --> 42:20.775
<i>-You love it?</i>
<i>-Yes, I do.</i>

42:20.908 --> 42:22.309
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

42:25.179 --> 42:27.815
<i>Uterine cancer</i>
<i>in a 42-year-old woman.</i>

42:29.150 --> 42:31.652
<i>Maybe a fall is waiting</i>
<i>inside each of us.</i>

42:31.786 --> 42:33.254
<i>A green sea, drowning.</i>

42:36.023 --> 42:37.825
<i>Marie went down so fast...</i>

42:39.326 --> 42:40.661
<i>nobody heard her splash.</i>

43:49.029 --> 43:51.198
- What are you doin'?
- Guess.

43:53.134 --> 43:54.536
Well,
it looks like you're reading.

43:54.935 --> 43:57.037
Well, you'd be wrong.
Guess again.

44:02.577 --> 44:03.911
You're writing?

44:04.478 --> 44:06.080
Ding, ding, ding!

44:06.213 --> 44:08.048
Maybe you should've stayed
in school, you're pretty smart.

44:10.384 --> 44:11.452
Are you kidding me?

44:12.219 --> 44:14.288
You know what happened to me,
and this is how you're acting.

44:14.955 --> 44:17.291
You want to know what
I hate most in the whole world?

44:18.058 --> 44:19.293
You know what,
I'm getting some ideas

44:19.426 --> 44:20.828
and maybe,
I'm thinking it's me.

44:21.362 --> 44:23.764
I hate not being listened to,
Antonio!

44:27.536 --> 44:28.903
I'm listening, Lita.

44:30.237 --> 44:31.906
You're not even
listening enough to know

44:32.039 --> 44:33.807
that you're not listening,
you're so out of it!

44:33.941 --> 44:35.176
Well, you know what--

44:35.943 --> 44:37.512
Well, maybe
if I could drink.

44:37.646 --> 44:40.147
Maybe if you would let me,
allow me to have one beer.

44:41.081 --> 44:43.284
Then maybe
I would listen to you!

44:47.656 --> 44:48.722
Hey, hey, hey.

44:49.490 --> 44:51.992
I didn't mean that, okay?
Just don't go. I'm-- I'm--

44:53.928 --> 44:55.196
I'm sorry.

44:56.363 --> 44:59.200
Look, I know
that you're struggling...

45:00.000 --> 45:01.902
but I can't take this, Antonio.

45:03.871 --> 45:05.139
You can't take this?

45:06.173 --> 45:08.275
What do you think
was taken from me in San Diego?

45:10.778 --> 45:12.514
Believe me, I know.

45:13.314 --> 45:15.783
But your life
didn't end there.

45:20.955 --> 45:22.389
You're doing it again.

45:23.257 --> 45:24.959
But all my life,
people have told me to shut up!

45:25.092 --> 45:27.928
-I never tell you to shut up.
-You might as well have!

45:29.196 --> 45:31.165
Look, I'm gonna
say this one time.

45:31.298 --> 45:32.833
So are you back
from wherever the hell you are,

45:32.967 --> 45:34.401
the edge of the abyss?

45:38.138 --> 45:40.808
Yes, I mean--
I'm-- I'm here. Yes.

45:43.043 --> 45:44.579
Brown girls like me?

45:45.246 --> 45:48.349
They know not to speak up,
and do you want to know why?

45:49.883 --> 45:51.285
Think I'm gonna get told.

45:51.418 --> 45:53.887
Because then we bring
attention to ourselves.

45:54.021 --> 45:55.155
Attention!

45:55.823 --> 45:58.025
And people tell me
like they have my whole life,

45:58.158 --> 45:59.994
"Who do you think you are?"

46:10.404 --> 46:12.172
- Stop.
- I'm right here!

46:12.741 --> 46:14.775
-Okay, I hear you.
-No, you don't.

46:14.908 --> 46:16.544
-I'm listening, right here!
-You don't!

46:16.678 --> 46:18.178
You're just trying to get back
together with me, Antonio,

46:18.312 --> 46:20.080
and that's not gonna happen!

46:21.348 --> 46:23.183
I thought
I could help you...

46:23.784 --> 46:26.487
but I can't,
not by myself.

46:32.893 --> 46:34.395
Yeah, go ahead, Antonio.

46:34.928 --> 46:36.830
Get mad,
like you always do.

46:40.868 --> 46:42.269
Fuck!

46:44.238 --> 46:45.507
There goes Antonio.

46:46.206 --> 46:48.108
Can't talk about his feelings.

46:50.477 --> 46:51.979
What do you
want me to do?

46:52.413 --> 46:54.081
You tell me right now,
you want me to do something,

46:54.214 --> 46:55.849
I'll do it right here!

46:55.983 --> 46:58.352
What do you want me to do?
I'll do anything, you tell me.

46:59.754 --> 47:01.021
I'll do it.

47:09.963 --> 47:11.131
Take me home.

47:30.050 --> 47:31.820
<i>ten, nine...</i>

47:31.952 --> 47:34.154
<i>We have ignition sequence...</i>

47:37.091 --> 47:40.595
<i>Three, two, one, zero.</i>

47:59.581 --> 48:01.415
<i>For the first time,</i>

48:01.549 --> 48:04.451
<i>three Americans board</i>
<i>the Saturn 5 Moon rocket.</i>

48:05.953 --> 48:07.287
<i>Calling Houston,</i>

48:07.421 --> 48:09.189
<i>you are a go for us,</i>.

48:11.225 --> 48:13.127
Emergency alarms are blaring.

48:15.329 --> 48:17.431
Mission hangs
in the balance.

48:21.803 --> 48:23.270
Where...

48:27.809 --> 48:29.209
where the hell am I?

49:02.577 --> 49:05.613
I need to talk to you, too.

49:14.789 --> 49:16.089
Hey, teacher.

49:19.561 --> 49:21.729
That mask makes you
look like a gangster.

49:24.331 --> 49:27.234
So, I don't really know
what we're doing here.

49:28.803 --> 49:31.171
- I think maybe you do.
- Well, then.

49:31.573 --> 49:33.173
Tell me
what you want to tell me.

49:33.875 --> 49:34.943
How's your boyfriend?

49:35.610 --> 49:37.645
Antonio and I
aren't dating anymore.

49:38.780 --> 49:40.013
Sorry to hear that.

49:40.147 --> 49:42.149
But I am really
worried about him.

49:42.617 --> 49:45.085
Why?
Seems like a pretty tough guy.

49:46.220 --> 49:48.188
Uh, six feet, remember?

49:48.690 --> 49:49.724
Let's just...

49:50.424 --> 49:52.125
what is this about?

49:52.627 --> 49:53.962
Antonio.

49:54.328 --> 49:55.597
Getting drunk every night
and trying to hurt himself

49:55.730 --> 49:57.765
because he lost
one of his best friends.

49:57.899 --> 49:59.032
I'm sorry to hear that,

49:59.166 --> 50:00.568
but what's it have to do
with me?

50:03.237 --> 50:04.806
Antonio and I
are still living together

50:04.939 --> 50:06.106
until the pandemic ends.

50:06.741 --> 50:08.308
Last night,
he came home so drunk,

50:08.442 --> 50:09.844
that he could
barely see or stand.

50:10.879 --> 50:13.313
Before he nodded off,
he said something to me.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.802
Okay.

50:48.516 --> 50:49.684
Ah.

50:52.219 --> 50:53.621
Wait, Antonio.

50:54.556 --> 50:56.223
How's your boyfriend doing?

50:57.025 --> 50:58.325
Your professor.

50:59.059 --> 51:00.327
Huh?

51:02.396 --> 51:04.632
You still taking
that shitty class?

51:09.336 --> 51:10.705
Let me tell you something.

51:11.573 --> 51:14.609
He's just like the white lady
of Central Park, <i>chica.</i>

51:15.777 --> 51:17.311
Just like her!

51:18.245 --> 51:19.847
No idea what that means.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.484
Well, neither did I.

51:25.285 --> 51:26.554
But this morning I realized

51:26.688 --> 51:28.523
he was talking
about the white lady

51:28.656 --> 51:31.358
who called the cops on the Black
birdwatcher in Central Park.

51:34.796 --> 51:36.864
I can tell
you know what this means.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.602
Let's take a walk.

52:05.492 --> 52:07.729
First, I want to explain.

52:08.896 --> 52:10.163
This is important.

52:11.799 --> 52:13.266
A good person was...

52:14.569 --> 52:15.435
lost.

52:15.870 --> 52:19.272
Not just anybody.
A really special person.

52:20.875 --> 52:22.142
Okay.

52:26.748 --> 52:28.148
There. Look.

52:31.753 --> 52:33.453
You're a fan
of the Apollo mission, yeah?

52:33.988 --> 52:36.490
One of the greatest successes
of the 20th century, yeah.

52:36.624 --> 52:38.458
I admit,
it's a favorite obsession.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.729
You're the expert, in class.

52:41.863 --> 52:43.363
I'm glad you think so.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.035
What Moon phase is that?

52:47.167 --> 52:49.403
Oh, uh...

52:50.370 --> 52:52.272
that's a full moon.

52:55.076 --> 52:58.112
A full moon is when the Sun
illuminates all of it.

52:58.245 --> 52:59.647
A hundred percent.

53:00.581 --> 53:02.083
This is a waning gibbous.

53:02.550 --> 53:04.686
See, there's a chunk
on the edge missing there?

53:05.520 --> 53:07.454
It's gone past
the full moon stage, about...

53:08.156 --> 53:09.590
90% illumination.

53:10.625 --> 53:11.693
Wow.

53:13.895 --> 53:14.962
I'm impressed.

53:17.098 --> 53:19.266
A few months ago, that would
have been all I needed.

53:22.469 --> 53:24.404
I would have just
taken the good grade

53:24.539 --> 53:25.973
and walked away happy.

53:27.441 --> 53:29.242
I don't know
what's going on here.

53:32.312 --> 53:35.516
I'm not just trying to
impress you anymore, Mr. Cole.

53:36.584 --> 53:38.251
I'm trying to show you
that there's more to the Moon

53:38.385 --> 53:39.887
than you think there is.

53:42.123 --> 53:44.559
Okay. I get it.

53:45.827 --> 53:46.961
No, you don't.

53:49.030 --> 53:51.599
Fine. Explain it to me.

53:54.535 --> 53:57.471
The Moon is about more
than white people landing on it.

53:58.873 --> 54:01.109
You know the Sun?
It's like you.

54:01.542 --> 54:04.112
Harsh and aggressive.

54:04.912 --> 54:06.581
You celebrate
what it celebrates.

54:07.148 --> 54:09.717
But your interests
could go beyond that.

54:11.586 --> 54:14.589
You see, the Moon doesn't have
its own energy source,

54:14.722 --> 54:17.491
but it is equal
to the Sun.

54:18.926 --> 54:20.427
Its power is...

54:21.696 --> 54:24.364
inward and mysterious.

54:25.233 --> 54:26.667
It moves in ways that,

54:26.801 --> 54:28.770
maybe to you,
aren't important...

54:29.904 --> 54:31.072
but they're real.

54:31.773 --> 54:33.941
Didn't know this was
about resenting my class.

54:34.842 --> 54:37.612
I like your class, Mr. Cole.
I do.

54:38.846 --> 54:40.648
But it only covers one side.

54:41.516 --> 54:43.818
It doesn't cover
everything and everyone.

54:43.951 --> 54:45.686
Make it sound like
I'm turning the Moon landing

54:45.820 --> 54:47.855
into a white savior narrative.

54:50.858 --> 54:52.994
Oh. Oh.

54:54.662 --> 54:56.197
Well, you're trying
to blow my mind

54:56.329 --> 54:57.965
and piss me off
at the same time.

54:58.599 --> 54:59.834
It's working.

55:10.745 --> 55:15.082
You know... I used to avoid
conversations like this.

55:17.919 --> 55:19.821
But now I know
I have to have them.

55:21.088 --> 55:23.858
Or you might do to someone else
what you did to Antonio.

55:25.960 --> 55:27.628
Let's just
talk about what happened.

55:46.147 --> 55:47.414
You okay?

55:48.616 --> 55:49.884
Whom are you talking to?

55:51.252 --> 55:53.087
Uh, you. Cole.

55:53.888 --> 55:55.189
Teacher.

55:55.323 --> 55:57.457
My name begins with
a "Mister" or a "Professor."

55:59.961 --> 56:00.995
Professor.

56:01.529 --> 56:03.331
Mr. Professor Cole.

56:03.931 --> 56:05.700
So, how many points
did I lose?

56:07.034 --> 56:08.302
All of them.

56:08.435 --> 56:09.770
Every single one.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.949
Damn.

56:26.087 --> 56:27.855
You just don't give a shit,
do you?

56:30.558 --> 56:32.260
Not the way
you think I should.

56:32.392 --> 56:33.594
God, can't you see?

56:34.161 --> 56:36.496
It's just like
someone like you would say.

56:41.569 --> 56:42.937
Someone like me?

56:43.070 --> 56:44.939
What can I do
to get you to understand?

56:45.072 --> 56:46.741
Maybe we don't speak
the same language.

56:46.874 --> 56:48.576
Oh, you think that
girlfriend of yours speaks

56:48.709 --> 56:50.144
the same language
as you, huh?

56:52.146 --> 56:53.514
How long do you think

56:53.648 --> 56:54.749
she is gonna let
someone like you drag her down?

56:54.882 --> 56:56.449
Takes me
five seconds to see

56:56.584 --> 56:58.052
that she's the brains
of the operation.

57:00.087 --> 57:01.789
Oh, now you're starting
to get heated.

57:02.356 --> 57:05.458
You know what? Sit tight.
I'll just talk to Lita instead.

57:11.032 --> 57:13.901
I'm being totally honest,
I was a little pissed that day.

57:16.604 --> 57:18.072
So, he jumped you, because--

57:18.205 --> 57:21.042
Because I said that
you and he were different.

57:23.110 --> 57:24.745
Which was clearly
a sore subject.

57:24.879 --> 57:27.480
-A sore subject?
-Look, it wasn't my best day.

57:28.316 --> 57:29.917
But he shouldn't have
gone wild like that,

57:30.051 --> 57:32.320
and obviously,
he shouldn't have jumped me.

57:33.054 --> 57:35.189
-Anyway. I should get back.
-Mr. Cole.

57:35.656 --> 57:37.291
A friend of mine told me

57:37.425 --> 57:39.827
the stories people make up
in their heads are dangerous.

57:40.828 --> 57:42.797
I think he meant
the stories people tell

57:42.930 --> 57:45.099
with their own interests
in mind.

57:46.334 --> 57:47.568
Well, I teach history...

57:48.235 --> 57:50.705
so my stories
are based on facts.

57:51.138 --> 57:53.307
In <i>México,</i>
stories can be factual

57:53.441 --> 57:55.009
and still empty
in the middle.

57:56.677 --> 57:58.145
I have a class to teach.

57:58.279 --> 58:00.114
I want you to think
differently about Antonio.

58:00.915 --> 58:03.284
Like me, he doesn't have
any real family.

58:04.085 --> 58:06.921
And he just lost
a really good friend recently.

58:11.491 --> 58:12.760
I, uh...

58:14.261 --> 58:16.197
I'm s-- sensitive to that.

58:22.069 --> 58:23.137
Are you?

58:23.270 --> 58:24.905
Look, what am I being
accused of here?

58:26.240 --> 58:28.576
I know
that you lost somebody, too,

58:28.709 --> 58:29.744
so you should be
the first person--

58:29.877 --> 58:31.579
That is my business.

58:35.616 --> 58:37.918
Okay. <i>Lo siento.</i>

58:39.687 --> 58:40.955
It's just...

58:42.356 --> 58:43.758
Antonio, he's...

58:45.126 --> 58:46.193
he's just...

58:46.861 --> 58:48.462
just falling.

58:49.030 --> 58:50.865
And I'm trying to figure out
a way to help him before--

58:50.998 --> 58:52.299
Before he hits the water.

58:54.368 --> 58:55.636
Yeah.

58:57.805 --> 59:01.108
I know it's crazy,
but I think you can help him.

59:02.243 --> 59:04.245
I need to tell you
the story of D'Andre.

59:11.085 --> 59:13.254
<i>Man, this is</i>
<i>"Black man get killed 101."</i>

59:13.988 --> 59:16.590
<i>Walkin' into people's</i>
<i>apartments</i>
<i>when they don't answer the</i>
<i>door?</i>

59:19.093 --> 59:20.761
<i>But Lita said</i>
<i>he'd be here.</i>

59:22.063 --> 59:23.764
<i>She said</i>
<i>he'd need to talk.</i>

59:27.735 --> 59:29.003
Yo, T?

59:31.472 --> 59:32.773
Tone?

59:35.242 --> 59:36.310
Yo, Antonio?

59:49.123 --> 59:51.092
Tonio.

59:54.695 --> 59:57.131
Jesus Christ.

59:59.433 --> 01:00:03.938
Can't a dude
get some fuckin' privacy?

01:00:07.074 --> 01:00:08.242
Oh.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.611
Damn, what, you livin'
on the toilet now?

01:00:10.744 --> 01:00:13.280
Oh, it helps
when you need to throw up.

01:00:13.814 --> 01:00:16.484
No. God.

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:22.923
Jesus, man.

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:28.162
Let me help you on that.

01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:30.231
I got it.

01:00:38.439 --> 01:00:39.807
What are you doin' in LA?

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.744
Ah, you know, bro,
just kickin' it about a...

01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:46.914
Bro, I'm not even gonna lie.
Lita called me.

01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:52.286
Lita? Yeah, I-- fuck Lita.

01:00:54.688 --> 01:00:57.091
You know she's the best thing
that ever touched your ugly ass.

01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:00.394
I know.

01:01:05.634 --> 01:01:07.034
It's over now, man.

01:01:08.603 --> 01:01:10.004
Well, you know,
the fighting.

01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:12.740
-God.
-When's she movin' out?

01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:14.708
Yeah, I think, like, um,

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:16.911
once this shit
with the pandemic cools...

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:21.882
she's out.

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:28.455
So what, bro,
you about to just sit around,

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:29.690
shittin' yourself all day?

01:01:30.124 --> 01:01:32.226
Oh, what do you expect
me to do?

01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:33.595
Hmm?

01:01:33.727 --> 01:01:34.895
My fucking--
I don't have a job.

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:36.797
College is done.

01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:38.999
Hmm. My girl hates me.

01:01:39.133 --> 01:01:40.635
- Yup.
- Yeah.

01:01:40.768 --> 01:01:42.036
But you know what?

01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:44.905
I ain't gonna
go down sober.

01:01:53.814 --> 01:01:55.082
Okay.

01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:58.052
You know what, then?

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.120
I got you to party with.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:04.024
I thought you'd be fucked up,
just not this fucked up.

01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:06.160
Stop, don't talk like that, man.
This is life!

01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:07.361
Huh?

01:02:07.928 --> 01:02:09.296
Open the hole,
drop the poison.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.165
-Nah, man.
-Like old times, come on.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:13.568
Not for me, get that shit
out of my face.

01:02:13.702 --> 01:02:16.870
Why?
No? Why?

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:18.105
Because, in a way,
goin' out drinkin'

01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:20.207
is what got D'Andre killed.

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:22.009
Yeah.

01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:27.081
You don't know that
for sure.

01:02:33.087 --> 01:02:34.589
But you know what, man?
Thank you, bro.

01:02:34.723 --> 01:02:36.457
So good to see you.
Thank you for the talk, man.

01:02:36.591 --> 01:02:39.293
Thank you for comin'
and checkin' up on me, <i>ese.</i>

01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:40.528
Well, thank you!

01:02:51.972 --> 01:02:53.474
Fool-ass.

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:02.349
No, you pathetic, boy.

01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:07.522
That is some strong language,
bro.

01:03:08.556 --> 01:03:10.725
You think you're strong enough
to be saying it?

01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:13.127
You lookin' to kill
your immune system off?

01:03:14.895 --> 01:03:16.397
I got a dead brother
that way.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.338
Well, I guess
the plan worked, didn't it?

01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:25.973
Excuse me?

01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.342
He's gone, man.

01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:31.011
Look at the fuckin' world
we live in, it's donkey shit!

01:03:32.279 --> 01:03:35.949
Only one thing to do now:
party time.

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:39.420
Motherfucker, did you hear
a word I just said?

01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:41.855
I said I got
a dead brother that way.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:44.358
I heard it.

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:45.627
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:49.564
But right now, I'm too--
numb, dumb to feel it.

01:03:50.864 --> 01:03:53.000
Well, you a coward, boy.

01:03:56.236 --> 01:03:58.807
Are you doubling down now?
Huh?

01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:02.443
Don't you ever call me boy,
ever again, okay?

01:04:03.778 --> 01:04:05.045
All right?

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.648
Ever again.

01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:08.048
Boy.

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.552
Little boy.

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:14.888
Punk, fool-ass boy.

01:04:22.597 --> 01:04:24.865
Boy. Yeah.

01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:34.441
You think you're hard
'cause you can slam some shit?

01:04:34.576 --> 01:04:36.410
Look at you.
Can't even stand up.

01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:37.945
-Yeah-- what. Right here.
-Yeah.

01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:40.447
Yeah. Telling it like it is.

01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:43.651
Let me hear it.
Come on.

01:04:46.487 --> 01:04:48.389
You know what, we want to keep
that ugly face of yours, right?

01:04:48.523 --> 01:04:50.424
You wanna do that?
You came here to come fight me?

01:04:50.558 --> 01:04:52.059
Okay, fine.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:53.427
You better make sure
your mouth writes a check,

01:04:53.561 --> 01:04:54.895
'cause I'm gonna
cash in on your teeth.

01:04:56.096 --> 01:04:58.265
But check this:
real men?

01:04:58.399 --> 01:05:01.502
Yeah, real men speak,
even when it hurts.

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:03.538
My bro taught me that.

01:05:21.556 --> 01:05:23.457
Fuck you, man,
you don't know me, fool.

01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:25.025
You wanna fight?

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:26.561
Come on, you don't know
how to fight, faggot!

01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:29.463
Come on.

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:30.832
You better watch out, bro,
I'm gonna fuckin'

01:05:30.964 --> 01:05:32.299
put you down for good, man.

01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:39.373
Look, bro, I don't like
the word "faggot," all right?

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.582
I am gay, but...

01:05:48.982 --> 01:05:50.250
I can fight.

01:05:54.756 --> 01:05:56.023
You what?

01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:02.697
I'm gay.

01:06:04.097 --> 01:06:05.365
That clear enough for you?

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.673
So what's your whole fuckin'--

01:06:11.806 --> 01:06:13.974
tell the whole fuckin'
rainbow coalition, man.

01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:16.678
What do you want me to do?
You think I give a shit?

01:06:17.579 --> 01:06:18.646
Give me a--

01:06:20.882 --> 01:06:22.650
What, what, just because
you never told nobody,

01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:24.318
what, you can
come in here and what?

01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:26.119
When everything's upside down?

01:06:26.253 --> 01:06:27.522
I told D'Andre.

01:06:30.224 --> 01:06:32.392
Yeah, I told him that night.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:38.432
What did he say?

01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:44.104
He said he already knew.

01:06:48.075 --> 01:06:49.343
That's just like him.

01:06:50.645 --> 01:06:53.146
He was always
a know-everything kind of guy.

01:06:55.015 --> 01:06:56.283
I hated his dumb--

01:06:56.985 --> 01:06:59.186
-dumb ass.
-No, you didn't.

01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:03.090
You loved him.

01:07:03.223 --> 01:07:04.491
And this...

01:07:05.927 --> 01:07:08.796
all this right here is your
ass-backwards way of showin' it.

01:07:12.567 --> 01:07:13.668
Tell me...

01:07:15.235 --> 01:07:16.905
Tell me again
what happened that night.

01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:19.172
Come on, bro, we already did
this shit a few hundred times.

01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:21.408
It's not gonna save anything.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:24.579
Humor me.

01:07:25.947 --> 01:07:27.515
All right, well...

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.818
we pulled up, and both
you and Lita didn't get out.

01:07:33.253 --> 01:07:35.122
She didn't feel right,
man, she's just--

01:07:35.255 --> 01:07:36.691
she didn't feel safe.

01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:39.661
That's why we brawled, big time.

01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:43.430
Maybe she wasn't wrong
to have that feeling.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.569
How you do it, man?

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:51.673
How are you even
dealing with this, man, like--

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.473
Bro, I'm hurtin', too,
all right?

01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:56.410
I just--

01:07:57.045 --> 01:07:59.079
I don't know.
I can't give in to it, though.

01:08:01.148 --> 01:08:02.416
Anyway...

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:05.887
I let Troy talk me
into the whole stupid deal.

01:08:07.855 --> 01:08:09.591
<i>This motherfucker was</i>
<i>yammerin' his fool drunk crap.</i>

01:08:09.724 --> 01:08:11.258
Talkin' about
a rack of Skittles, man.

01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:12.860
Jesus Christ.

01:08:12.994 --> 01:08:14.829
I dunno what's goin' on, man.-?

01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:16.296
<i>I was starting</i>
<i>to realize what a dumb call</i>

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.464
<i>bringing his ass there, what--</i>

01:08:17.599 --> 01:08:18.832
Oh, look at that!

01:08:21.903 --> 01:08:24.005
- Man, look at his face, dawg!
- Levi Adam!

01:08:24.136 --> 01:08:25.773
Levi Angie!
He got in that ad!

01:08:25.907 --> 01:08:28.009
There's no way--
Hey, that-- that board's rigged.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.176
Dawg.
That's why you my dawg, man.

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:31.779
Yeah, yeah.
We get that, too.

01:08:31.912 --> 01:08:33.615
You're my dawg, you better
pay me the money, then,

01:08:33.747 --> 01:08:35.148
-yeah, you saw it, right?
-I ain't paying shit.

01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:37.585
Let's take a minute.

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:39.486
Hello there, B.

01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:42.255
-Can I have moonshine?
-Hey.

01:08:43.825 --> 01:08:45.292
We closed, man.

01:08:46.828 --> 01:08:48.127
This right here?

01:08:49.363 --> 01:08:50.497
Private audience.

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:52.734
Hey, man, what's up?

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.167
Hey, Tom-Tom.

01:08:54.935 --> 01:08:57.170
- Tom-Tom?
- S'all good, Cantrell.

01:08:57.304 --> 01:08:58.740
I know this guy way back.

01:08:58.872 --> 01:08:59.907
What's up, Jamal?

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.576
Looking good.

01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:04.211
I'll be with you in a sec.

01:09:06.546 --> 01:09:07.814
What was that flirtin'?

01:09:08.247 --> 01:09:10.018
What?
Nah, chill, bro, we're friends.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.385
Yeah, right.

01:09:12.053 --> 01:09:13.286
I knew it.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.122
-Knew what?
-You sweet on him, huh?

01:09:15.255 --> 01:09:16.724
Oh, my--

01:09:16.858 --> 01:09:18.425
Hey, mommy and daddy finally
let you out, huh?

01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:21.796
Fighting out there in the car,
as always.

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:25.066
Dude, why you gotta be
such a asshole?

01:09:25.198 --> 01:09:26.701
'Cause I need a drink, man!

01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:28.703
We shouldn't
have to wait too long.

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:31.438
Jamal knows the bartender.

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:33.941
Said he was lookin'
real good, didn't he?

01:09:34.075 --> 01:09:35.143
You're a player, man?

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:37.578
But don't you got
all those guys up there?

01:09:37.712 --> 01:09:39.147
We're playing twos,
need a ringer.

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:40.682
Figured you guys'd
be the athletes.

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:42.050
-What the--
-What the heck does that mean?

01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:43.850
It's a compliment, bro.

01:09:43.984 --> 01:09:45.352
You guys play everything good,
except quarterback, that is.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:48.321
-Okay, now you playin'.
-Whoa!

01:09:48.723 --> 01:09:50.558
Are you bein' a racist, fool?

01:09:50.692 --> 01:09:52.459
- Nah, man, I'm cool.
- You're cool in what world?

01:09:52.593 --> 01:09:54.095
You got a problem here,
small-time?

01:09:54.227 --> 01:09:55.697
I got your small-time
right here, come and get it,

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:57.431
-you bitch-ass motherfucker.
-Yeah.

01:09:57.565 --> 01:09:58.900
Let's go.
We know you got problem here.

01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:00.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:00.601 --> 01:10:02.070
What's up, guys?
What are you havin'?

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.471
These guys ain't drinkin'.
Hey, hey, Cantrell.

01:10:04.605 --> 01:10:06.306
We got attitude over here.

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.876
Black kind.

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:11.179
Boy, you're about to get
bitch slapped, real quick.

01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:12.914
Hello. Fellas.

01:10:14.615 --> 01:10:16.984
Guy here just said
he was gonna give me a beatdown.

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:20.988
-In my house?
-That did not happen.

01:10:21.522 --> 01:10:22.924
You called him out for lying?

01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:25.760
I'm callin' him out
for wishful thinkin'.

01:10:37.471 --> 01:10:38.973
What am I doing here?

01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:42.643
I'm a damn fool.

01:10:43.144 --> 01:10:45.179
Been cooped up in my house

01:10:45.312 --> 01:10:47.615
for a month and a half,

01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:50.551
drinkin' too much,
and the first chance I get,

01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:53.286
I go to a dark bar
to drink some more.

01:10:55.523 --> 01:10:57.525
What the hell
are we doing here?

01:10:57.658 --> 01:10:59.392
Burning off at the mouth
is what you doin'.

01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:01.394
-Shut up.
-Or he could be insulting

01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:02.997
the bar owner, too.

01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:06.333
The one that didn't invite him
here in the first place.

01:11:06.466 --> 01:11:07.602
I never would.

01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:09.203
I have nothing
but appreciation

01:11:09.336 --> 01:11:10.872
for business owners
like yourself.

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:15.143
Ah, shit.
This kid's got balls.

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:18.513
Okay. Proceed appreciating.

01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:20.447
Let me just say
one true thing,

01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:23.316
and then I will buy
everybody in this bar a drink,

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:24.719
and we will go home.

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:27.188
- Cool?
- Just give me the drink.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.157
-Hold the preach, bitch.
-Levi.

01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:31.058
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

01:11:33.161 --> 01:11:35.295
My mom used to
make me do this deal.

01:11:36.063 --> 01:11:38.266
Whenever I was ready
to do somethin' super stupid,

01:11:38.398 --> 01:11:42.670
she would make me
tell her one true thing.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.639
So...

01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:47.942
here's today's true.

01:11:48.609 --> 01:11:50.845
I had a collapsed lung
when I was a kid.

01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:53.648
Didn't know it.

01:11:54.414 --> 01:11:57.752
It gave me chronic bronchitis.

01:11:57.885 --> 01:11:59.452
Messes with
the breathing passageway,

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:01.689
so you overproduce mucus.

01:12:02.557 --> 01:12:04.391
Anyway, it sucks.

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:09.630
Now, I never
really was into sports.

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:11.331
I-- I couldn't be.

01:12:12.233 --> 01:12:14.068
Instead, I worked on my lungs.

01:12:15.402 --> 01:12:18.172
I was a... mad

01:12:18.306 --> 01:12:20.473
king walker.

01:12:20.608 --> 01:12:22.243
Now, I found

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:25.279
this big old grassy hill

01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:27.081
on top of downtown.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:31.384
I walked there every day.

01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:35.455
Lay on the grass,
stare at the sky.

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:41.329
I could... breathe there,

01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:43.764
like, full gulps.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:47.101
That was air, man.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.505
Sometimes I stayed there
till the moon came up.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.611
Inhaling... exhaling.

01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:01.616
Here's the thing.

01:13:03.684 --> 01:13:05.686
I don't walk much anymore.

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.489
I haven't been
to that hill in years.

01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:12.860
Why is that?

01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:14.996
Because air is for invalids.
Let's cocktail, please.

01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:16.396
Levi.

01:13:17.999 --> 01:13:19.066
Quiet.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.502
I'll take it on.

01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:26.107
Why you don't
go there no more.

01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:32.479
One day...

01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:36.083
you went up
to that grassy hill...

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.688
sun shinin'...

01:13:42.223 --> 01:13:43.991
the wind was crackin' hard.

01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:48.596
And you laid down
on that grassy hill...

01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:52.432
bam!

01:13:54.402 --> 01:13:55.836
Nothin'.

01:13:57.204 --> 01:13:58.471
Stale.

01:13:59.273 --> 01:14:00.741
Probably no big deal,

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:03.511
but definitely
not like the breaths

01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:05.780
you took as a young turd.

01:14:07.415 --> 01:14:08.716
And so what did you do?

01:14:11.819 --> 01:14:14.722
Hmm, I wonder
where there's a dark bar.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.959
Man, please, with that shit.

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:23.798
Listen up...

01:14:27.034 --> 01:14:29.136
'cause here's
the one true thing.

01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:34.141
When you're a kid...

01:14:35.776 --> 01:14:39.647
everything happens
for the very first time.

01:14:42.683 --> 01:14:44.719
But when you become an adult...

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.922
those same breaths that you took

01:14:48.055 --> 01:14:51.525
just don't do it
for you no more.

01:14:53.694 --> 01:14:55.830
And what do you say about that?

01:14:58.199 --> 01:14:59.266
Maybe...

01:15:00.601 --> 01:15:01.869
um...

01:15:02.737 --> 01:15:04.005
here's my take.

01:15:05.773 --> 01:15:10.044
Life is never second-rate.

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:12.780
People go cold.

01:15:13.948 --> 01:15:18.219
The world
whips us along so fast.

01:15:18.753 --> 01:15:20.621
We get out of alignment.

01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:23.524
Don't fix ourselves.

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:25.359
You're right, bro.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.696
One day,
I went to that hill...

01:15:29.663 --> 01:15:31.098
took that breath...

01:15:32.566 --> 01:15:33.834
and it wasn't the same.

01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:40.674
Not because
breathing got old, though.

01:15:42.176 --> 01:15:44.178
It was because
my mom and dad died.

01:15:46.313 --> 01:15:49.850
I... lost the upside.

01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:53.921
I lost hope.

01:15:58.793 --> 01:16:00.061
Air is good.

01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:02.863
Always.

01:16:03.764 --> 01:16:06.267
But sometimes
it just hurts to taste.

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:11.439
Man, I already
tasted fuckin' coronavirus

01:16:11.572 --> 01:16:12.606
listening to this shit, I'm out.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.343
- Fuckin' come on, man.
- Man, fuck me raw.

01:16:24.652 --> 01:16:25.920
Oh.

01:16:31.926 --> 01:16:34.295
Tell me about
this one true thing.

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:37.231
Sounds like D'Andre.

01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:39.166
He always knew
how to turn anything around.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.069
Who didn't love the guy
after five minutes?

01:16:42.203 --> 01:16:44.872
Ha, the guys that hated him,
wanted to kill him.

01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:46.907
There's plenty of them, too.

01:16:52.514 --> 01:16:53.781
I wish I never met him.

01:16:57.818 --> 01:16:59.086
You, too.

01:17:00.788 --> 01:17:02.056
Damn.

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:06.727
You know you--

01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:09.263
you start hangin' with a guy,
you know, you start...

01:17:10.831 --> 01:17:12.166
you stop seeing the differences.

01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:16.704
You just start seein' the dude.

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:21.775
That one's-- that's is true.
All real, all the time.

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.278
You know what?

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.148
I have to be, too.

01:17:28.916 --> 01:17:30.317
You know, good shit, bro.

01:17:31.986 --> 01:17:33.420
One true thing, huh?

01:17:36.924 --> 01:17:38.959
I wish I had Mom
for as long as you did.

01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:42.963
I don't know, I-- I--
I just wish I had more memories.

01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:45.833
She loved you, dude.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.035
So did Pops.

01:17:50.738 --> 01:17:52.139
For both of them, then.

01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:55.276
I-- I need to speak
my one true thing.

01:18:00.447 --> 01:18:01.849
I-- I'm gay.

01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:04.785
I know, dude.

01:18:04.919 --> 01:18:06.187
You know?

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.255
Proud of you
for saying so, though.

01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:12.459
Hey, everybody.

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:15.564
A toast to my bro, Jamal, here.

01:18:15.696 --> 01:18:17.666
He just became a man.

01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:29.009
You know, earlier,
you asked me how I'm doin'.

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.446
I tell you what, bro.

01:18:34.949 --> 01:18:36.417
D told me one last thing.

01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:39.787
Yeah, they were about to hook
him up to the ventilator.

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:42.323
He said something to you?

01:18:45.059 --> 01:18:47.261
Yeah, and I was almost gonna
keep it a secret, too.

01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:52.166
But now I realize that I can't.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.972
Through a glass window,
he told me...

01:18:58.839 --> 01:19:00.174
that he's gonna be okay.

01:19:01.543 --> 01:19:02.910
But if he's not,

01:19:03.043 --> 01:19:05.714
and you wanna go around
blaming yourself, don't.

01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:09.651
Because you blamin' yourself
is the same as you blamin' me.

01:19:10.284 --> 01:19:12.186
And I won't be
nobody's reason to stop.

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:16.156
How is blamin' myself
the same as blamin' him?

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.259
Well, we're family.

01:19:19.059 --> 01:19:20.494
All right, and in family,
there's no place

01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:21.696
he ends and I begin.

01:19:22.263 --> 01:19:24.231
And that's the same thing
for you and I.

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.268
That's why I'm here.

01:19:30.104 --> 01:19:31.905
So get up off your ass, Ant.

01:19:32.806 --> 01:19:35.276
Come on, don't make D
the reason that you stop.

01:19:37.111 --> 01:19:38.546
He wouldn't be good with that.

01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:42.950
You hearin' that okay?

01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:57.064
I appreciate you're
trusting me with all this.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.067
Bad stuff happens.

01:20:01.168 --> 01:20:03.270
Then more bad stuff,
if you don't trust anyone.

01:20:05.806 --> 01:20:07.074
Ten days later...

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:09.476
D'Andre was gone.

01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:14.081
Did you guys, um...

01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:16.450
did you even get to see him?

01:20:17.418 --> 01:20:18.485
Jamal did.

01:20:19.186 --> 01:20:21.455
Through the hospital plexiglass,
six days later.

01:20:23.223 --> 01:20:24.825
This thing, COVID...

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.595
tore right through him.

01:20:27.729 --> 01:20:29.731
And Antonio figured,

01:20:29.863 --> 01:20:31.398
"I drove him to the bar, so..."

01:20:34.703 --> 01:20:35.969
When we got the news...

01:20:37.104 --> 01:20:39.340
I gave Antonio all of my anger.

01:20:40.675 --> 01:20:41.942
Everything.

01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:45.279
Now I just wish
I could take it all back.

01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:48.449
So you guys are...

01:20:49.551 --> 01:20:50.618
I mean--

01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:54.154
He's gonna be okay.

01:20:55.757 --> 01:20:57.024
You don't know that.

01:20:57.592 --> 01:20:58.859
And neither do I.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:04.532
There's this movie,
D'Andre told me about it.

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:05.700
It's interesting.

01:21:06.233 --> 01:21:08.502
You ever watched
a movie called <i>Matewan?</i>

01:21:08.636 --> 01:21:09.903
Yeah.

01:21:10.037 --> 01:21:11.573
It's a John Sayles,

01:21:11.706 --> 01:21:14.408
I used to screen it
in a 101 class that I taught.

01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:16.611
What do you think it's about?

01:21:17.344 --> 01:21:19.413
It's about
a coal strike in the 1920s.

01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:21.415
More.

01:21:22.717 --> 01:21:24.385
These coal company people,

01:21:24.519 --> 01:21:26.554
they tried to divide
the workers up,

01:21:26.688 --> 01:21:27.921
make 'em hate each other,

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:29.423
so that
the coal business can grow.

01:21:30.457 --> 01:21:32.893
They try and trap 'em in those
dark tunnels with no light.

01:21:35.329 --> 01:21:37.097
But people share things,
don't we?

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:42.637
And eventually,
we all wake up, don't we?

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:45.472
And then--

01:21:47.509 --> 01:21:48.576
and then--

01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:51.111
and then, I don't know.

01:21:56.283 --> 01:21:58.051
How about I email Antonio?

01:22:00.688 --> 01:22:05.292
Maybe try to apologize
for what happened there.

01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:07.361
Thank you.

01:22:09.029 --> 01:22:11.599
Antonio, like most men...

01:22:12.399 --> 01:22:14.334
is strong
when it comes to toughness,

01:22:14.468 --> 01:22:16.538
but weak when it comes
to dealing with pain.

01:22:20.809 --> 01:22:21.876
Hey, you know what?

01:22:22.777 --> 01:22:24.579
I'm gonna watch
<i>Matewan</i> again, too.

01:22:25.713 --> 01:22:27.715
Your analysis
is better than mine.

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:29.818
Stole it from a friend.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.162
<i>That semester wasn't over yet.</i>

01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:43.765
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:48.703
<i>On May 25th, George Floyd,</i>
<i>a 46-year-old Black man,</i>

01:22:48.837 --> 01:22:50.304
<i>husband and father,</i>

01:22:50.437 --> 01:22:52.707
<i>got cuffed</i>
<i>and shoved into a police car</i>

01:22:52.841 --> 01:22:55.810
<i>for passing</i>
<i>a counterfeit $20 bill.</i>

01:22:56.477 --> 01:22:58.278
<i>Second day, Jamal drove up.</i>

01:22:58.412 --> 01:23:00.013
<i>We watched it</i>
<i>at home for a night.</i>

01:23:00.815 --> 01:23:03.718
<i>The cops said he was on drugs,</i>
<i>then turned around</i>

01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:05.887
<i>and said he was</i>
<i>in medical distress,</i>

01:23:06.019 --> 01:23:07.522
<i>so they were helping him.</i>

01:23:07.655 --> 01:23:09.757
<i>Didn't say they'd pulled him</i>
<i>out of the car,</i>

01:23:09.891 --> 01:23:12.760
<i>pinned him under the full</i>
<i>weight</i>
<i>of a police officer.</i>

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.029
<i>Didn't say</i>
<i>they crushed his air passage.</i>

01:23:16.463 --> 01:23:17.966
<i>They didn't have to.</i>

01:23:18.098 --> 01:23:19.466
<i>We saw it.</i>

01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:21.669
<i>And then we said no.</i>

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.872
<i>No more.</i>

01:23:24.004 --> 01:23:26.006
Black Lives Matter!
Black Lives Matter!

01:23:26.139 --> 01:23:29.844
Black Lives Matter!
Black Lives Matter!

01:23:29.978 --> 01:23:31.513
Black Lives Matter!

01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:40.588
<i>The KKK's so very stupid...</i>

01:23:40.722 --> 01:23:42.590
<i>Something about following,</i>

01:23:42.724 --> 01:23:44.993
<i>while others just</i>
<i>go on about their days.</i>

01:23:45.727 --> 01:23:50.765
<i>Something about being</i>
<i>disconnected to everything.</i>

01:23:51.498 --> 01:23:54.536
<i>The resources,</i>
<i>the testing for the symptoms...</i>

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:17.324
<i>It hit me then.</i>

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:23.031
<i>To quote myself, "We do</i>
<i>big challenges here in America,</i>

01:24:23.163 --> 01:24:26.734
<i>for we are a nation that</i>
<i>accomplishes lofty</i>
<i>aspirations."</i>

01:24:27.367 --> 01:24:30.070
<i>This time, though,</i>
<i>the goal wasn't space.</i>

01:24:30.772 --> 01:24:33.608
<i>They were doing</i>
<i>what I couldn't, or wouldn't.</i>

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:39.212
<i>I wasn't Icarus.</i>
<i>I was the plowman.</i>

01:24:39.847 --> 01:24:42.717
<i>The fisherman.</i>
<i>And the shepherd.</i>

01:24:44.384 --> 01:24:46.554
<i>I was a goddamn bystander.</i>

01:24:47.589 --> 01:24:51.291
<i>And I was drowning</i>
<i>in my own bullshit.</i>

01:25:06.173 --> 01:25:08.175
All right, guys, I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

01:25:08.308 --> 01:25:09.644
What time are we at it tomorrow?

01:25:10.277 --> 01:25:11.980
-11:00 a.m.
-All right.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.448
- Good night.
- Good night, Jamal.

01:25:14.582 --> 01:25:15.650
Ugh.

01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:21.221
Ugh.

01:25:21.355 --> 01:25:22.724
Man, I can't feel my legs.

01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:26.594
Oh, they're there.
They're just chillin'.

01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:28.096
Promise?

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:30.632
I could
rub 'em for you to prove it.

01:25:30.765 --> 01:25:33.200
Oh, Antonio.
Don't be so--

01:25:33.333 --> 01:25:35.603
-Romantic?
-Horny.

01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:37.605
What, it's...

01:25:38.205 --> 01:25:40.541
protesting fires me up.

01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:42.442
Well, keep it in your pants!

01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:44.211
What, you can't trust me?

01:25:45.046 --> 01:25:47.180
Haven't I proved myself
these last few weeks?

01:25:49.249 --> 01:25:50.317
You have.

01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:52.720
But I'm not
in the same place anymore.

01:25:53.554 --> 01:25:54.789
What does that mean?

01:25:55.455 --> 01:25:57.357
It means,
I want to hear my voice

01:25:57.491 --> 01:25:59.226
without yours
on top of it for a while.

01:25:59.894 --> 01:26:01.495
How long, for a while?

01:26:05.365 --> 01:26:06.701
Been whispering my whole life.

01:26:07.535 --> 01:26:09.169
I'm tired of whispering.

01:26:11.005 --> 01:26:13.440
Is that what the speech is
about tomorrow?

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:15.576
You're on the microphone?

01:26:16.678 --> 01:26:19.379
Hopefully,
it's about a lot more than that.

01:26:22.449 --> 01:26:24.619
Hey, hey. Hey, um...

01:26:26.988 --> 01:26:28.823
can you stay up
for a little bit with me?

01:26:29.524 --> 01:26:31.626
I just-- one beer.

01:26:31.993 --> 01:26:33.761
I have to finish my final.

01:26:34.529 --> 01:26:35.963
- For, uh--
- Cole's class?

01:26:36.097 --> 01:26:37.364
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:40.635
Did you open any of his emails?

01:26:44.605 --> 01:26:45.907
And here I thought
you were getting better

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.307
at expressing yourself.

01:26:48.275 --> 01:26:49.644
Good night.

01:26:50.377 --> 01:26:51.746
Li-- Lita, hey.

01:26:54.115 --> 01:26:55.482
Just hear me out, okay?

01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:57.785
I got nobody.

01:26:58.418 --> 01:26:59.687
You wanna know what I got?

01:27:01.055 --> 01:27:02.523
And I, uh...

01:27:04.357 --> 01:27:05.827
I didn't protect you.

01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:09.530
In San Diego?

01:27:11.999 --> 01:27:13.266
I let you down.

01:27:16.303 --> 01:27:17.672
Let everybody down.

01:27:21.542 --> 01:27:22.944
I didn't do my job.

01:27:33.187 --> 01:27:34.789
I didn't do my job.

01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:37.390
Please don't hate me.

01:27:37.825 --> 01:27:39.894
Don't.

01:27:40.027 --> 01:27:42.630
It was never
about protecting me.

01:27:44.565 --> 01:27:46.701
It was about respecting me.

01:27:47.467 --> 01:27:48.770
I respect you.

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:51.271
I do.

01:27:55.342 --> 01:27:56.611
I'm sorry.

01:27:58.679 --> 01:28:00.982
I'm sorry
I've been so angry with you.

01:28:03.618 --> 01:28:05.352
And about D'Andre.

01:28:07.889 --> 01:28:09.924
I'll always be sorry
for the time you lost

01:28:10.057 --> 01:28:11.391
with such a good man.

01:28:13.761 --> 01:28:15.797
But you had great memories, too.

01:28:17.098 --> 01:28:18.733
And those don't just leave.

01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:23.738
And who we have as friends
says everything about us.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.776
So you want to know what?

01:28:31.846 --> 01:28:34.381
The fact
that he was your friend

01:28:34.515 --> 01:28:36.284
makes me wonder
what you are going to be like

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:39.554
in a few years,
when all this is over.

01:28:49.564 --> 01:28:50.832
You're thinkin' of him...

01:28:52.499 --> 01:28:53.768
it'll be my--

01:28:54.635 --> 01:28:55.903
Not a chance.

01:29:01.175 --> 01:29:02.442
You know me.

01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:04.745
I believe in hope.

01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:09.083
Good night.

01:30:35.569 --> 01:30:36.837
You okay?

01:30:38.072 --> 01:30:40.708
He's here,
but he might not come.

01:30:41.342 --> 01:30:42.710
We're on our way to a protest.

01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:51.018
I lied to you.

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.487
I know.

01:30:56.157 --> 01:30:57.625
I was pissed that day.

01:30:59.459 --> 01:31:00.828
I let it take me over.

01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:03.331
I saw it.

01:31:04.231 --> 01:31:07.068
You were breathing in anger.
You had to push it out.

01:31:10.571 --> 01:31:11.839
I didn't know how.

01:31:14.809 --> 01:31:16.077
You know what I don't get?

01:31:17.812 --> 01:31:19.080
Why didn't Antonio tell

01:31:19.213 --> 01:31:20.114
the department chair
what happened?

01:31:20.247 --> 01:31:21.315
I-- he--

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:23.184
he could have outed me.

01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:26.654
Looks like
you can ask him yourself.

01:31:30.091 --> 01:31:31.158
I will.

01:31:54.248 --> 01:31:55.549
I read your email.

01:31:56.917 --> 01:31:58.519
You wanna say something?

01:32:04.125 --> 01:32:05.693
The old world,

01:32:05.826 --> 01:32:08.863
the one that existed
before this virus.

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:11.365
- It had a big defect.
- Don't do that.

01:32:11.499 --> 01:32:12.566
You guys always do that.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.068
Talk about the world.

01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:16.904
The world this, the world that.
Talk to me.

01:32:17.872 --> 01:32:20.441
You know, they always stand by--
wha-- what's the word?

01:32:20.574 --> 01:32:22.843
-Platitudes.
-Platitudes.

01:32:22.977 --> 01:32:24.011
Huh?

01:32:24.612 --> 01:32:25.946
Yeah, that's right.

01:32:26.647 --> 01:32:28.182
What I wanted to say is...

01:32:29.383 --> 01:32:30.951
the part that was missing in it

01:32:31.085 --> 01:32:33.654
was the part
that was missing in me.

01:32:34.655 --> 01:32:35.923
Empathy.

01:32:37.758 --> 01:32:39.528
It's almost like
we've gone too far

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.095
with self-reliance
and individualism--

01:32:41.228 --> 01:32:42.296
Mr. Cole.

01:32:42.863 --> 01:32:44.265
He wants to hear from you...

01:32:45.332 --> 01:32:46.667
not your mind.

01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:50.271
Well, that's the part
that I'm not good at.

01:32:51.439 --> 01:32:52.840
It's never too late to learn.

01:32:54.575 --> 01:32:55.843
Just speak.

01:32:57.211 --> 01:32:58.712
If you talk,
I might listen.

01:33:00.114 --> 01:33:03.117
That day, uh,
you had just said

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.087
that you and I
don't speak the same language.

01:33:07.254 --> 01:33:09.957
And I said you and Lita
don't speak the same language,

01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:11.358
which I shouldn't have done...

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.995
but I couldn't even
hear myself think.

01:33:17.932 --> 01:33:20.167
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't-- don't-- just--

01:33:20.301 --> 01:33:21.602
don't go there, bro.

01:33:22.369 --> 01:33:24.505
-I mean, Cole.
-Mister.

01:33:24.638 --> 01:33:26.140
Mr. Cole.

01:33:27.241 --> 01:33:31.045
See, I can go anywhere I want,
because I have an education.

01:33:31.412 --> 01:33:33.180
Because I have
the respect of the community.

01:33:33.314 --> 01:33:34.381
You know what you have?

01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:36.717
What?

01:33:37.418 --> 01:33:38.652
Nothing.

01:33:38.786 --> 01:33:41.956
No voice,
no standing, nothing.

01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:45.960
Listen to this. Learn this.

01:33:46.093 --> 01:33:48.996
Without an education,
what do you have?

01:33:49.964 --> 01:33:51.398
I guess I'm gonna find out.

01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:54.869
You.
You were all alone.

01:33:56.003 --> 01:33:59.406
And you think
you have so much time.

01:34:00.941 --> 01:34:03.978
But there is nothing
in front of you but failure.

01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:07.348
Look, I'm done. I'm done.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:09.183
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, you can't--

01:34:10.084 --> 01:34:11.418
you can't say that,
you-- you're a teacher.

01:34:11.553 --> 01:34:12.686
I can say whatever I want.

01:34:13.387 --> 01:34:15.656
No one's gonna believe
someone like you anyway.

01:34:17.691 --> 01:34:20.794
You are kind of
like that lady in Central Park.

01:34:20.928 --> 01:34:22.763
Oh, God, no. No.

01:34:26.367 --> 01:34:27.434
Yes.

01:34:28.969 --> 01:34:30.237
I didn't mean to be.

01:34:31.071 --> 01:34:34.008
But Antonio,
why did you not speak?

01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:37.278
I, um, just...

01:34:38.445 --> 01:34:39.713
Say it.

01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:42.883
I didn't think you could.

01:34:46.053 --> 01:34:48.088
I need to get cool
with people like him.

01:34:50.224 --> 01:34:52.226
You know,
when I was a little kid,

01:34:52.359 --> 01:34:54.061
my mom and dad
got in a fight...

01:34:56.497 --> 01:34:57.765
and it was really bad.

01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:01.435
And they came...

01:35:03.037 --> 01:35:04.405
and they took my dad away.

01:35:08.577 --> 01:35:10.377
I don't know
how it happened, or where.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.215
But they found him dead.

01:35:15.282 --> 01:35:16.350
Beaten to death.

01:35:18.485 --> 01:35:19.787
He wasn't a bad man.

01:35:22.022 --> 01:35:24.124
He wasn't a criminal,
he was nothing like that.

01:35:26.427 --> 01:35:27.494
He didn't have...

01:35:28.597 --> 01:35:31.298
anybody to answer for him.

01:35:33.133 --> 01:35:34.768
I'll never forget...

01:35:35.537 --> 01:35:36.671
what they did to him.

01:35:36.804 --> 01:35:38.239
They did what they wanted to do.

01:35:39.608 --> 01:35:43.010
I'll never forget
watching them take him away...

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:45.379
and he was arguing.

01:35:48.315 --> 01:35:49.383
And I miss him.

01:35:51.151 --> 01:35:52.486
And last time I saw him...

01:35:54.888 --> 01:35:56.156
he was cold.

01:35:59.159 --> 01:36:00.427
And he didn't wake up.

01:36:03.864 --> 01:36:05.232
And, from that moment on...

01:36:06.867 --> 01:36:08.335
I never wanted to be like that.

01:36:10.204 --> 01:36:11.472
So I kept my mouth shut.

01:36:12.273 --> 01:36:14.808
I never talked, I never argued,
I never did nothing.

01:36:19.346 --> 01:36:20.414
I tried.

01:36:21.448 --> 01:36:23.317
I tried to speak up,
I tried to talk about it,

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.719
but it never worked.

01:36:24.852 --> 01:36:26.120
They didn't want to listen.

01:36:27.656 --> 01:36:29.023
He just got angry.

01:36:32.793 --> 01:36:34.061
People like you.

01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:36.897
You don't want to listen.

01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:44.539
And when people like him...

01:36:46.508 --> 01:36:47.575
when they're angry...

01:36:48.909 --> 01:36:50.177
they can't be trusted.

01:37:00.054 --> 01:37:01.322
It's awful.

01:37:01.723 --> 01:37:02.990
It's awful.

01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:09.531
And I took you
back there, 'cause...

01:37:10.565 --> 01:37:11.899
I got angry.

01:37:14.935 --> 01:37:16.203
You're right about me.

01:37:19.674 --> 01:37:20.941
I, um...

01:37:24.244 --> 01:37:25.613
my fiancée, uh...

01:37:25.747 --> 01:37:27.915
...she--

01:37:28.616 --> 01:37:29.684
she died.

01:37:29.818 --> 01:37:31.352
Um...

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.357
and I was raging,
and you were there to blame.

01:37:38.459 --> 01:37:39.960
It just cost
too much to see--

01:37:40.094 --> 01:37:41.462
Mr. Cole.

01:37:42.831 --> 01:37:44.666
I'm sorry
about your fiancée.

01:37:45.232 --> 01:37:47.334
Really, I am, truthfully.

01:37:48.703 --> 01:37:51.071
But it cost too much
to do what you did.

01:37:52.106 --> 01:37:54.576
And then, it cost too much
to do what you both did.

01:37:55.442 --> 01:37:56.511
To not talk.

01:37:58.145 --> 01:37:59.413
That's what...

01:38:02.015 --> 01:38:03.283
that's why.

01:38:03.984 --> 01:38:05.319
Oh, my God.

01:38:05.452 --> 01:38:06.688
I have to change something.

01:38:07.187 --> 01:38:08.455
Can I borrow that?

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.157
Sure.

01:38:12.527 --> 01:38:13.894
She's givin' the first speech.

01:38:14.529 --> 01:38:17.464
Wow, uh, uh, and--
and this woman can write,

01:38:17.599 --> 01:38:19.233
I have graded
a few of her papers.

01:38:20.067 --> 01:38:23.036
Tell me about it.
I used to be her boyfriend.

01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:28.576
Antonio...

01:38:30.944 --> 01:38:33.681
it will never be enough, but...

01:38:36.718 --> 01:38:37.985
I'm sorry.

01:38:42.055 --> 01:38:43.323
I'm sorry, too.

01:38:43.924 --> 01:38:45.192
About your fiancée.

01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:49.631
I feel like
we all lost somebody.

01:38:50.698 --> 01:38:53.701
I mean, she lost her brother
and her dad.

01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:56.604
I have to include that.

01:38:57.371 --> 01:38:59.574
Wow.
Must be one hell of a speech.

01:38:59.707 --> 01:39:01.743
Oh, yeah.
She won't even let me read it.

01:39:02.309 --> 01:39:04.044
Well, I'd love to hear it.

01:39:07.414 --> 01:39:10.117
-Really?
-Of course.

01:39:10.652 --> 01:39:12.720
Yo, what is the holdup?

01:39:12.854 --> 01:39:14.955
Were you guys just about to
leave me in the car forever?

01:39:15.489 --> 01:39:16.990
Do you check the clouds?

01:39:17.892 --> 01:39:19.193
Eh, it's not good.

01:39:20.795 --> 01:39:21.863
What is it?

01:39:22.029 --> 01:39:23.263
Zero.

01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:25.700
Cloud could cover all of LA.

01:39:26.233 --> 01:39:27.501
Strawberry moon tonight.

01:39:28.536 --> 01:39:30.237
Moonface put it in her speech.

01:39:31.071 --> 01:39:32.406
It's what I call her.

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.542
- Moonface.
- Oh, it suits her.

01:39:35.075 --> 01:39:36.310
Don't humor him.

01:39:37.177 --> 01:39:39.012
No, please.
Humor me, Cole.

01:39:39.146 --> 01:39:40.849
I mean, Mr. Cole.

01:39:40.981 --> 01:39:42.517
Oh, God. Call me Ethan.

01:39:44.351 --> 01:39:46.053
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:39:47.988 --> 01:39:49.256
He was a good man.

01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:52.660
He was the best of the best.

01:39:54.027 --> 01:39:55.329
He had a way with words.

01:39:57.064 --> 01:39:59.066
The only person that I know
that could do that...

01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:01.569
was Lita.

01:40:03.303 --> 01:40:04.839
Did you put him in the speech?

01:40:04.973 --> 01:40:06.306
Of course.

01:40:07.642 --> 01:40:08.710
It's ready.

01:40:09.076 --> 01:40:10.512
If you guys want to hear it.

01:40:12.747 --> 01:40:14.047
- Of course.
- Yeah.

01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:15.349
- Yeah.
- All ears.

01:40:27.795 --> 01:40:29.496
Hi.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.769
My name is Lita Ortiz.

01:40:35.904 --> 01:40:37.539
And I was born in bad luck.

01:40:40.642 --> 01:40:44.512
And people born in bad luck
often lose hope.

01:40:46.748 --> 01:40:49.584
I haven't seen my mother
in over 20 years,

01:40:49.717 --> 01:40:51.619
because she lives
in Jalisco, México.

01:40:53.287 --> 01:40:55.690
She survives,
but that is all.

01:40:58.225 --> 01:41:02.664
My brother and my father died
on my journey here, to America.

01:41:04.766 --> 01:41:06.801
Trying to teach themselves
to be hopeful

01:41:06.935 --> 01:41:07.902
until their very last breaths.

01:41:08.036 --> 01:41:09.269
Daddy!

01:41:10.605 --> 01:41:14.241
You see, to us,
America is where hope flowed.

01:41:16.678 --> 01:41:20.347
But my brother and my father
never even got to taste the air

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.316
on the other side
of the Rio Grande.

01:41:24.986 --> 01:41:26.253
I did.

01:41:27.487 --> 01:41:28.556
I lived.

01:41:29.489 --> 01:41:31.391
But hope was still
not in the cards.

01:41:32.392 --> 01:41:33.661
Not even here.

01:41:37.765 --> 01:41:38.833
My friends...

01:41:39.767 --> 01:41:40.835
my teachers...

01:41:42.003 --> 01:41:44.471
my boyfriends don't know it.

01:41:45.172 --> 01:41:46.440
It's invisible.

01:41:49.409 --> 01:41:51.378
We hide in the shadows.

01:41:52.914 --> 01:41:54.247
Speak too softly.

01:41:55.083 --> 01:41:56.350
And die young.

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.521
They tell me to have kids,

01:42:00.655 --> 01:42:03.156
because they expect me dead
by the time I'm 30.

01:42:04.993 --> 01:42:07.562
I'm 29. And I'm not dead.

01:42:07.695 --> 01:42:09.363
- That's right.
- That's right, man.

01:42:09.496 --> 01:42:11.264
And I don't plan
to be anytime soon.

01:42:11.398 --> 01:42:12.900
Woo!

01:42:13.034 --> 01:42:16.503
I have a confidence, though,
that cannot be drowned.

01:42:18.372 --> 01:42:21.776
I swam to America
in the semi-darkness...

01:42:22.777 --> 01:42:24.612
with only the moon
as my company.

01:42:25.747 --> 01:42:26.814
I walked.

01:42:27.782 --> 01:42:28.850
I walked.

01:42:29.984 --> 01:42:31.251
And then I ran.

01:42:32.185 --> 01:42:33.721
Until I found dry landing.

01:42:36.256 --> 01:42:38.291
I stumbled
until I could see clear...

01:42:39.661 --> 01:42:41.896
but it was right then
that I began to get lost.

01:42:44.364 --> 01:42:47.035
I'm from a place
where trusting anyone

01:42:47.167 --> 01:42:48.435
leaves you open to pain...

01:42:49.137 --> 01:42:51.438
where optimism is for suckers.

01:42:53.975 --> 01:42:57.512
But we must learn
to believe different.

01:42:59.346 --> 01:43:02.215
I used to think that people
pay price no matter what...

01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:04.952
but I know different now.

01:43:07.922 --> 01:43:09.791
I knew a man
for a single night.

01:43:11.191 --> 01:43:12.492
His name was D'Andre.

01:43:14.128 --> 01:43:15.763
He had a broken-down house.

01:43:16.931 --> 01:43:18.265
No degree.

01:43:19.767 --> 01:43:20.902
A lot of dreams.

01:43:22.003 --> 01:43:23.203
And a really bright soul.

01:43:24.105 --> 01:43:27.008
He was a believer
in the America that is to come.

01:43:27.875 --> 01:43:30.845
He knew
that the price of not believing

01:43:30.978 --> 01:43:33.915
was an America
that benefited the few,

01:43:34.048 --> 01:43:35.883
and that price is too high.

01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:38.619
And we must stop paying it.

01:43:39.252 --> 01:43:40.621
We cannot...

01:43:41.354 --> 01:43:43.256
and we will not
pay the price any longer.

01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:44.892
Yeah!Woo!

01:43:45.026 --> 01:43:46.359
That's right!

01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:50.531
This new
generation of Black,

01:43:50.665 --> 01:43:53.668
brown and white anti-racists
will change that.

01:43:54.202 --> 01:43:56.938
We cannot, and we will not
pay the price any longer.

01:43:59.507 --> 01:44:01.743
We have suffered
for too long,

01:44:01.876 --> 01:44:03.711
and we have
looked for ourselves

01:44:03.845 --> 01:44:06.848
in the cloudy faces
of those in power.

01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:10.283
Yeah, yeah.
Mans, we do!

01:44:11.384 --> 01:44:12.653
So, today...

01:44:13.855 --> 01:44:15.857
we must put down the ideas...

01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:19.326
that don't allow us
to see clear.

01:44:20.862 --> 01:44:23.030
And we must
turn our heads to the skies.

01:44:23.731 --> 01:44:25.298
All right. Yes!

01:44:26.299 --> 01:44:27.802
There is a moon tonight.

01:44:28.603 --> 01:44:29.971
One that can't be seen.

01:44:30.905 --> 01:44:31.973
But it is there.

01:44:32.472 --> 01:44:33.808
A strawberry moon.

01:44:34.374 --> 01:44:37.779
And it is pulsing
with imagination.

01:44:39.013 --> 01:44:42.150
Feelings and emotions,

01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:43.851
and they matter, too.

01:44:43.985 --> 01:44:45.553
- All right.
- That's right.

01:44:45.686 --> 01:44:47.054
- Yeah.
- Okay. Right, Lita.

01:44:48.923 --> 01:44:50.191
We must realize

01:44:50.323 --> 01:44:52.459
that we are the America

01:44:52.593 --> 01:44:54.028
that has yet to speak.

01:44:56.097 --> 01:44:57.397
And our words...

01:44:58.566 --> 01:45:00.300
will fill the skies.

01:45:02.302 --> 01:45:03.905
Well?

01:45:04.639 --> 01:45:06.306
What do you guys think?

01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:10.377
Come on, say something.

01:45:11.112 --> 01:45:12.412
Anything?

01:45:15.850 --> 01:45:18.085
-Don't...
-...change...

01:45:18.219 --> 01:45:20.453
...a word.

01:45:24.058 --> 01:45:26.426
<i>Look at these people clapping.</i>

01:45:27.228 --> 01:45:29.297
<i>Just cheering.</i>

01:45:29.462 --> 01:45:30.731
<i>So hopefully.</i>

01:45:31.398 --> 01:45:33.534
<i>Beneath a cloudy, moonless sky.</i>

01:45:33.968 --> 01:45:36.971
<i>A sea of tranquility</i>
<i>in the middle of a pandemic.</i>

01:45:38.405 --> 01:45:40.007
<i>I get it.</i>

01:45:40.141 --> 01:45:43.711
<i>Alarms blaring are not</i>
<i>astronauts Armstrong or Aldrin,</i>

01:45:43.845 --> 01:45:47.414
<i>or this young woman.</i>

01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:51.319
<i>We can still get things done.</i>

01:45:51.451 --> 01:45:53.221
<i>Even in the worst of times.</i>

01:45:53.855 --> 01:45:56.858
<i>We can stand up and be heard.</i>

01:46:01.329 --> 01:46:03.564
<i>Wouldn't have chosen</i>
<i>this pandemic timing,</i>

01:46:03.698 --> 01:46:06.133
<i>but it seems right somehow.</i>

01:46:07.301 --> 01:46:08.736
<i>D'Andre would agree.</i>

01:46:09.337 --> 01:46:12.039
<i>It's time</i>
<i>to rise above that heavy load.</i>

01:46:12.974 --> 01:46:14.842
<i>So we gather together now.</i>

01:46:16.544 --> 01:46:18.045
<i>We share the fight.</i>

01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:21.782
<i>The goal is to get there,</i>
<i>wherever there is, together.</i>

01:46:22.449 --> 01:46:23.751
<i>Not divided.</i>

01:46:24.952 --> 01:46:26.386
We're still...

01:46:27.154 --> 01:46:28.488
learning the ropes.

01:46:28.623 --> 01:46:30.658
This year was an education,
for sure.

01:46:31.893 --> 01:46:34.829
Maybe we're moon students.

01:46:36.463 --> 01:46:37.497
I don't even know
what that means,

01:46:37.632 --> 01:46:38.866
but I like the sound of that.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.002
Still no moon, though.

01:46:42.103 --> 01:46:43.971
Ah, I knew
we were too optimistic.

01:46:45.573 --> 01:46:47.508
I don't know,
it's kind of like astronomy.

01:46:57.351 --> 01:46:58.686
Just gotta have faith.

01:47:01.355 --> 01:47:02.690
A new phase is coming.
