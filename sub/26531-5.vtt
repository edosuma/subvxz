are hard, right?

05:42.015 --> 05:44.265
And you and I are basically--

05:44.348 --> 05:45.848
you know, look,
it's like this hike.

05:45.932 --> 05:47.974
You know, there's some
nice, flat stretches,

05:48.057 --> 05:49.556
and then some fucking climbs,

05:49.640 --> 05:51.306
and at the end of the climb,
you're still panting.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.348
Well, I'm still panting
after our emotional climb.

05:54.431 --> 05:55.932
And I was also bitten
by a snake.

05:56.015 --> 05:57.348

It's hard to break the habit of
going through your phone,

06:08.932 --> 06:11.015

without me checking it,

lunch plans with Braylen.

06:23.140 --> 06:26.265

06:26.348 --> 06:27.682

that you did not

06:27.765 --> 06:29.182

and wedge salads?

06:34.932 --> 06:37.182
- I mean to say
that his mother's sick

06:37.265 --> 06:40.140
and we discussed it,
and I decided to do what's best

06:40.224 --> 06:42.182
for our relationship
and not go.

06:42.265 --> 06:44.515

06:48.515 --> 06:51.057

sprinkle arsenic all over it?

But now,

06:57.682 --> 07:01.182

07:14.390 --> 07:16.890
How long do I have to pay?

07:16.974 --> 07:18.431

to pay off those rooms

07:21.515 --> 07:23.598

07:23.682 --> 07:24.598

07:24.682 --> 07:25.890
- Him being a very stylish

07:25.974 --> 07:27.556

07:27.640 --> 07:30.306
was it important
to his hipsterdom

07:30.390 --> 07:33.515
to fuck in a hotel
that embodied his very nature?

07:33.598 --> 07:36.890
Could he not get off without
a needlepoint of a badger

07:36.974 --> 07:38.807
and a vintage mirror
in the room?

07:38.890 --> 07:40.598
- I'm not doing this.

07:40.682 --> 07:43.140
I came on this trip for you.

07:43.224 --> 07:46.015

I am so grateful for that.

07:51.515 --> 07:53.099

07:53.182 --> 07:57.099

08:15.556 --> 08:17.807
Please, can we save this
for Dr. Schildkraut?

08:17.890 --> 08:20.473

to say, and I save them.

08:20.556 --> 08:21.807

08:21.890 --> 08:23.015
I don't yell  them

08:23.099 --> 08:24.265

come to me.

08:47.974 --> 08:49.431
I carefully grocery shopped,

08:49.515 --> 08:51.515
and an animal ate
those shoppings.

08:51.598 --> 08:52.974
And nobody would have
appreciated

08:53.057 --> 08:55.099
my Meyer lemon chicken
and couscous anyway,

08:55.182 --> 08:56.556
so just buy whatever you like.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.348
- But didn't you have a vision
for tonight's dinner?

08:58.431 --> 09:00.057
- Whatever I pick is gonna
be hotly contested.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.765
Let's skip it.
- I'll just buy a bunch

09:01.848 --> 09:04.099
of ground chuck and make my
patented jumbo sliders then.

09:04.182 --> 09:06.224
- I guess I'll make
my famous rolls.

09:06.306 --> 09:08.099
- Since when are your rolls
famous, Carleen?

09:08.182 --> 09:11.765
I've never even heard you say
the word "roll" until just now.

09:11.848 --> 09:13.306
You know, if you're gonna
do that, though,

09:13.390 --> 09:15.556
could you also do
other carbs as well, like...

09:15.640 --> 09:18.265
new potatoes, sweet potatoes,
potato chips?

09:18.348 --> 09:19.723
What is wrong with me?

09:19.807 --> 09:21.306
Why do I have to make it
so easy for everyone?

09:21.390 --> 09:23.390
- I'll get dessert, I guess.
- Does anyone have

09:23.473 --> 09:25.140
a slice of paper?
- Yes.

09:25.224 --> 09:27.306
I have a Moleskine
in the glove compartment.

09:27.390 --> 09:28.598
I find it a great place
to jot down

09:28.682 --> 09:30.015
idle thoughts in traffic.

09:30.099 --> 09:31.556
- Nobody needs to hear
your poetry, Walt.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.682
Mother's Day
is more than enough.

09:33.765 --> 09:36.390
You know what, Carleen?
Why don't you do dessert?

09:36.473 --> 09:37.556
Carbs is kind of a big job.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.015
- I thought you liked my poems.

09:39.099 --> 09:42.598
Whoa, you're really going
for blood today, Katty.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.556
- Wait, so was I demoted?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.057
- Well, you weren't promoted.
Let's put it that way.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.224
Come on, guys,
let's get this moving.

09:48.306 --> 09:50.932
- You think that bar is walking
distance from here?

09:53.974 --> 09:55.431
- I have an idea.

09:55.515 --> 09:58.598
Maybe we can all do a quick
visualization exercise

09:58.682 --> 10:04.015
in which we successfully
picture retrieving our items.

10:10.099 --> 10:13.848
- [sighs]

10:18.640 --> 10:20.015
'Sup?

10:22.765 --> 10:25.556
- Okay, thanks, man.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.723
- Did they let you go poop?
- Uh, no.

10:27.807 --> 10:29.723
They don't consider a tank top
a shirt.

10:29.807 --> 10:33.057
But I swiped you something.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.265
Sweets for my sweet.

10:35.348 --> 10:36.765
- What is this?

10:36.848 --> 10:38.015
- It's a Ring Pop.

10:38.099 --> 10:41.265
Now you have
many rings from me.

10:41.348 --> 10:42.974
- Did you steal it?

10:43.057 --> 10:45.140
- Yes, I did.

10:45.224 --> 10:46.932
- Do you see that guy in there?

10:47.015 --> 10:49.473
He probably makes,
like, $2 an hour,

10:49.556 --> 10:52.473
and you just stole
on his watch.

10:52.556 --> 10:54.556
- Well, you stole
these tiny pants for me.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.848
- I only steal from businesses
that overcharge.

10:57.932 --> 10:59.306
I only steal from assholes.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.640
- Okay, just...
just unwrap it, okay?

11:01.723 --> 11:03.224
It's delicious.

11:03.306 --> 11:04.390
Lick it.

11:05.182 --> 11:07.807
- It's just, how do I really
know it's for me?

11:07.890 --> 11:10.473
I mean, you got it for me,
you gave it to me,

11:10.556 --> 11:13.140
but you could take it back
at any moment.

11:13.224 --> 11:17.099
Why would I lick it
if it's not really mine?

11:19.598 --> 11:21.723
[sighs]

11:22.890 --> 11:24.224
- I mean, I just can't believe

11:24.306 --> 11:27.640
you would be that
emotionally irresponsible.

11:27.723 --> 11:29.431
- You wanna talk
responsibility?

11:29.515 --> 11:31.224
This morning,
when you were with Orvis,

11:31.306 --> 11:34.515
you asked him if he was
"down to fucking clown."

11:34.598 --> 11:35.807
He's, like, six.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.182
- Six year olds
love curse words.

11:37.265 --> 11:39.182
Curse words are crack
for children.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.015
"Pussy," "asshole,"
"fuck," "titties."

11:42.099 --> 11:43.265
They love it.

11:43.348 --> 11:44.723
Look, look, we can't
do this, all right?

11:44.807 --> 11:46.390
We gotta settle.
If we go back to the camp

11:46.473 --> 11:48.765
and we're fighting, too,
it's gonna be pandemonium.

11:48.848 --> 11:50.682
What do you say
we just smoke some weed?

11:50.765 --> 11:52.515
- You have weed?

11:52.598 --> 11:55.224
- Yeah, I brought my vape.

11:55.306 --> 11:56.515
- Okay.

11:56.598 --> 11:59.640
I feel safe now.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.848
- Could I get a sample
of that lean-ground sirloin?

12:06.932 --> 12:10.431
I'm gonna need to do
a taste test.

12:10.515 --> 12:12.015
Raw is fine.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.431
You know what?
Just put it right in my mouth.

12:18.182 --> 12:21.556
- Oh, Orvis, you're not allowed
to drink the...

12:21.640 --> 12:23.598
Never mind.

12:28.556 --> 12:30.140
- Excuse me, sir?

12:30.224 --> 12:33.515
Can you direct me
to the nonpareils?

12:33.598 --> 12:35.390
- The what?

12:35.473 --> 12:38.515
- The nonpareils.

12:38.598 --> 12:40.556
- Huh?

12:40.640 --> 12:45.473
- A decorative confectionary
made of tiny, sugary balls?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.598
- Did you try
the beef jerky aisle?

12:47.682 --> 12:49.515
- That's the first place
I looked.

12:49.598 --> 12:53.099
- ♪ I like pickles
and pickles like me ♪

12:53.182 --> 12:56.515
[singing indistinctly]

12:56.598 --> 12:57.765
- [sighs]

12:57.848 --> 13:00.224
Oh, thank God!
Walter.

13:00.306 --> 13:03.182
- Hey, Carleen.
Fancy meeting you here.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.473
- [sighs] I can't find
any nonpareils,

13:05.556 --> 13:08.640
and I worry that my dessert
choices won't be up to snuff.

13:08.723 --> 13:11.140
- You know what?
This is my birthday,

13:11.224 --> 13:12.431
so I will be the judge

13:12.515 --> 13:15.848
of whether the desserts
are up to snuff.

13:15.932 --> 13:17.265
- [sighs]
But, Walter,

13:17.348 --> 13:20.431
it's not your opinion
that I worry about.

13:20.515 --> 13:22.306
I think we both know
what I mean.

13:22.390 --> 13:24.390
- I think we both do.

13:24.473 --> 13:26.598
- You know, I am not one
to get angry.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.848
- No, of course not.
You're so even-tempered.

13:29.682 --> 13:32.265
- Mom said I was like
a spaniel:

13:32.348 --> 13:35.348
always ready for a walk,
a nap, or a snack.

13:35.431 --> 13:37.057
- Steady.

13:37.140 --> 13:39.431
- Steady.

13:39.515 --> 13:42.765
[exhaling] Oh, but right now,
I don't feel so steady.

13:42.848 --> 13:45.473
I feel really unsteady,
actually.

13:45.556 --> 13:50.431
I have this feeling
in my throat that scares me.

13:50.515 --> 13:52.807
Is this what rage tastes like?

13:52.890 --> 13:54.932
- Excuse me.
This isn't social hour.

13:55.015 --> 13:56.348
- We'll talk later.

13:56.431 --> 13:58.140
- [claps hands]
Let's--let's move it along.

13:58.224 --> 14:01.682
- Oh, I was just here for,
um, cat food.

14:03.723 --> 14:05.224
- Walt, are those all pickles?

14:05.306 --> 14:06.765
- Yeah, I wanted to make sure

14:06.848 --> 14:09.265
that George, Miguel, and I
had a jar each.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.224
- Are we gonna have
a meal of pickles?

14:13.140 --> 14:14.848
- Well, I'm not done, Kathryn.

14:14.932 --> 14:16.515
- Honestly,
just look in your cart

14:16.598 --> 14:19.265
and imagine how you'd react
if you were me.

14:19.348 --> 14:21.807
[sighs]
- I can't.

14:21.890 --> 14:22.848
- What?

14:22.932 --> 14:24.556
- I can't imagine
how I'd react.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.890
It is beyond my imagination
what you think.

14:29.099 --> 14:32.140
I just want pickles.
I'll pay for the pickles.

14:32.224 --> 14:33.765
[whispering]
These are my fucking pickles.

14:36.807 --> 14:39.099
- Walt!
Walter!

14:41.723 --> 14:44.182
- Oh, good.
We can get a drink.

14:44.265 --> 14:46.099
- Well, they probably won't
open for, like,

14:46.182 --> 14:47.598
maybe another five hours.

14:47.682 --> 14:49.807
- Let's see about that.
[knocking on door]

14:49.890 --> 14:52.224
[door clicks open]

14:52.306 --> 14:53.515
- Hey.

14:53.598 --> 14:56.057
- Hey.
What's up with this cute place?

14:56.140 --> 14:58.556
- Uh, we're open at 2:00.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.431
- Wouldn't it be
so much more fun

15:00.515 --> 15:04.390
if you were open,
like, right now?

15:04.473 --> 15:07.473
[giggles]

15:16.057 --> 15:17.390
- Mm.

15:17.473 --> 15:21.057
What do you think Mojo's
doing right now?

15:21.140 --> 15:23.890
- He's a cat.
He's probably sleeping.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.515
- But what if he's not?

15:25.598 --> 15:28.182
What if he's started a
revolution in the neighborhood?

15:28.265 --> 15:29.890
You never know.
You really don't, you know?

15:29.974 --> 15:32.556
He might have gathered
all the cats,

15:32.640 --> 15:35.140
and they're rising up
to take Silver Lake back

15:35.224 --> 15:38.015
from the oppressive
human regime.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.348
- Do you want a blow job?

15:43.431 --> 15:45.140
- [chuckling]
Oh.

15:45.224 --> 15:48.265
A blow job from a pretty lady
in a barn?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.723
You're on.

15:49.807 --> 15:52.265
But this isn't a peace
offering beej, right?

15:52.348 --> 15:54.224
I don't want your pity suck.

15:54.306 --> 15:57.182
- So you're turning down
a blow job?

15:57.265 --> 16:00.224
Even if it's for
a little while?

16:00.306 --> 16:01.765
- I don't know if it's gonna be
a little while.

16:01.848 --> 16:04.099
It's probably gonna
just take a minute.

16:04.182 --> 16:05.682
- Even better.

16:07.224 --> 16:08.765
- [exhales]

16:08.848 --> 16:11.890
I keep forgetting
that I'm mad at you.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.306
But I am  mad at you.

16:18.390 --> 16:19.932
All right?
[zipper unzips]

16:20.015 --> 16:21.431
Very mad.

16:21.515 --> 16:24.473
I mean, fuck Braylen.

16:24.556 --> 16:28.265
And fuck you--oh.
- [slurps]

16:34.057 --> 16:36.473
- Joe.
- Jesus!

16:36.556 --> 16:38.515
Carleen, what?

16:38.598 --> 16:41.015
- You startle so easily lately.

16:41.099 --> 16:44.306
It must be a
post-acute-withdrawal symptom.

16:44.390 --> 16:46.556
- You mind not nursing me
to death?

16:46.640 --> 16:49.265
- I'm trying
to nurse you to life.

16:49.348 --> 16:53.348
But if you would rather
Jandice do the job, she can.

16:53.431 --> 16:55.140
- What are you talking about?

16:55.224 --> 16:57.182
- I know you rubbed
against her in the night.

16:57.265 --> 17:00.099
I heard all about it.

17:00.182 --> 17:01.556
- From who?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.848
All right, Kathryn?
She's on Adderall.

17:03.932 --> 17:06.099
You can't trust
a thing she says.

17:06.182 --> 17:08.932
- [sighs] I can tolerate
a whole lot, Joe.

17:09.015 --> 17:11.473
I can take whatever
is thrown at me.

17:11.556 --> 17:14.556
But don't make a fool
out of me, okay?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.306
Don't make me the fool.

17:16.390 --> 17:18.348
- Yeah, I'm not--
I'm not doing that.

17:18.431 --> 17:19.974
All right?
I would never do that to you.

17:20.057 --> 17:21.765
- Then what were you doing
with her in the night?

17:21.848 --> 17:24.224
- We were j--we were talking,
all right?

17:24.306 --> 17:25.974
We were kicking around
business ideas.

17:26.057 --> 17:27.348
I'm not cheating on you.

17:27.431 --> 17:30.099
- Was it a business idea
for a kissing machine?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.265
- [sighs]

17:31.348 --> 17:32.556
Car--you know what, Carleen?

17:32.640 --> 17:34.182
Can you just back the fuck off,
all right?

17:34.265 --> 17:36.431
[stammers] I don't know
what was going on, all right?

17:36.515 --> 17:37.974
I was drunk, so...

17:38.057 --> 17:40.640
- You're always drunk.

17:45.306 --> 17:48.932
- [retches, coughs]

17:50.473 --> 17:52.224
- How come every time I see
you, you're having, like,

17:52.306 --> 17:54.306
some insane puke-athon?

17:54.390 --> 17:56.932
- [groans softly]

17:57.015 --> 17:59.182
[retches]

18:01.640 --> 18:03.640
You okay?

18:04.390 --> 18:05.890
- [sighs]

18:05.974 --> 18:08.431
[chuckles weakly]

18:08.515 --> 18:11.182
- Sophia, you have
to try belly dancing.

18:11.265 --> 18:15.140
It is literally the only
palatable form of exercise.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.224
- Hey, excuse me, Jandice,
but seriously,

18:17.306 --> 18:19.431
I-I think we need
to talk about this more.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.099
Are you serious?
You wanna go home?

18:21.182 --> 18:22.932
- Okay, just let me finish

18:23.015 --> 18:27.974
with Jeffrey's Long Island
iced tea.

18:28.057 --> 18:30.890
Here you go, sir.

18:30.974 --> 18:32.265
Enjoy.

18:32.348 --> 18:35.932
[sighs happily] You guys just
make me feel so relaxed.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.890
[laughing] But I also wanna
drive in a convertible

18:38.974 --> 18:40.932
and just let my hair down.

18:41.015 --> 18:42.723
[laughing]
This guy.

18:42.807 --> 18:44.932
The fuck do you want?

18:45.015 --> 18:48.723
I'm trying to serve people.

18:48.807 --> 18:51.099
[groans loudly]

18:51.182 --> 18:52.932
What the fuck?

18:53.015 --> 18:54.099
- Oh.

18:54.182 --> 18:55.556
- Oh, I should
probably tell you
