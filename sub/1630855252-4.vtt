18:40.380 --> 18:42.140
Which means check your phones,
hide your wallets,

18:42.340 --> 18:44.940
leave your babies at home,
because no one is safe.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.960
[Jorge laughing] Okay.

18:48.410 --> 18:49.820
Is this the party of Jorge Diaz?

18:50.020 --> 18:51.420
Yeah.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.700
"YOLO. Love, Hank."

18:59.900 --> 19:00.990
[laughter]

19:01.190 --> 19:03.210
Okay, I am loving
every moment of this.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.290
It is so much more fun
when you're not his keeper.

19:06.490 --> 19:08.560
$1,500?

19:09.350 --> 19:12.550
No. Um, hi. The seals are still
on, we're not paying for this.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.260
You know what? Can someone
call Henry's phone for me,

19:14.460 --> 19:15.860
- please? Just one sec.
- I'm on it.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.820
[phone ringing]

19:19.860 --> 19:21.930
- Great. He left it.
- Well...

19:22.130 --> 19:23.270
Okay. You can just put
everything on the room.

19:23.470 --> 19:24.560
Thank you so much.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.100
Look, I'll just deal with it
with Nick later.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.560
I have to go find Henry,
or Hank, or whatever.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.940
This is all my fault.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.900
- I'm gonna start
a group thread.
- [Jorge] Okay.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.150
Okay. Yeah.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.820
I'm gonna just search
every cabana.

19:35.020 --> 19:36.490
Sol, you check the casino out

19:36.690 --> 19:38.070
and just report back
with any findings, okay?

19:38.270 --> 19:39.530
- And the two of you...
- [Javier] Will stay here.

19:39.730 --> 19:41.680
- We'll be right here.
- We put in our time.

19:43.010 --> 19:46.210
He's like a bi Filipino
gremlin. Who knew?

19:46.410 --> 19:50.460
<i>[Jorge] I thought Hank would</i>
<i>be more fun, not more work.</i>

19:50.660 --> 19:52.650
Wait, I see something.
I'm gonna call you back.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.530
Hi. Wh-Where did you
get this hat?

19:59.570 --> 20:02.310
My wife Darla was playing craps

20:02.510 --> 20:04.850
and this man said Cheryl
was Lady Luck.

20:05.050 --> 20:09.230
And if Darla kissed Cheryl,
she'd roll a seven.

20:09.430 --> 20:11.230
So, they kissed.

20:11.430 --> 20:14.190
Darla did roll a seven.

20:14.390 --> 20:16.650
Now my wife and Cheryl
are in my hotel room

20:16.850 --> 20:18.450
and I wasn't invited. [sobs]

20:18.650 --> 20:21.070
I'm so sorry.

20:21.270 --> 20:23.790
By any chance, did the
homewrecker look like this guy?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.830
Yeah, that's the guy.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.080
And he stole my blazer.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.000
I'm so sorry, again.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.310
But which way did he go?

20:34.060 --> 20:35.270
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.720
Hey, they found Hank.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.180
- Oh, great.
- [woman] No, no.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.930
No, no, no, no.

20:47.130 --> 20:49.240
Look at my face.
Look at my face!

20:50.700 --> 20:51.690
Hey, is everything okay?

20:51.890 --> 20:52.940
I got my furniture
off Craigslist.

20:53.140 --> 20:54.230
I thought, "Why wouldn't
why I trust it

20:54.430 --> 20:55.730
for my wedding makeup?"

20:55.930 --> 20:57.780
Oh, it-it's not that bad.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.910
I look like a clown. [sobs]

21:01.110 --> 21:04.120
Well, luckily for you, I am
a professional makeup artist.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.290
And I have my kit just upstairs.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.250
- What?
- Yeah, pro bono.

21:08.450 --> 21:10.040
I can fix this.

21:10.240 --> 21:15.590
[woman] He won't love me
if he sees me like this.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.460
No, now, none of that.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.550
Last weekend, I did a wedding,
a quinceañera,

21:19.750 --> 21:21.090
and a last-minute
homecoming dance.

21:21.290 --> 21:22.430
Cystic acne.

21:22.630 --> 21:25.180
And I told them all
what I am telling you now:

21:25.380 --> 21:27.060
I will make you love
your outside face,

21:27.260 --> 21:29.740
if you promise
to love your inside face.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.650
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- [sobbing] Okay.

21:33.850 --> 21:36.120
[sobbing]

21:42.260 --> 21:44.120
Hey. Any luck? Did you find him?

21:44.320 --> 21:45.240
I don't see him anywhere.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.620
Will you be dining
with us today?

21:47.820 --> 21:49.370
Have you seen this man?

21:49.570 --> 21:50.790
Oh, yeah, he was just here.

21:50.990 --> 21:52.330
He ordered a Paloma
and a seafood tower.

21:52.530 --> 21:53.790
Really?
Do you know where he went?

21:53.990 --> 21:54.830
No. Sorry.

21:55.030 --> 21:56.170
[sighs]

21:56.370 --> 21:57.310
[phone chimes]

21:58.230 --> 22:00.340
Oh, that's a relief.

22:00.540 --> 22:01.760
Do you want the seafood tower?

22:01.960 --> 22:02.970
He left before I could serve it.

22:03.170 --> 22:04.220
- No, thank you.
- That's okay, thanks.

22:04.420 --> 22:05.510
Well, he already paid.

22:05.710 --> 22:06.930
Big tipper.

22:07.130 --> 22:08.930
Oh. Oh, yeah, we eating that.

22:09.130 --> 22:10.810
Any open table,
I'll be right with you.

22:11.010 --> 22:12.270
Thank you.

22:12.470 --> 22:15.520
- Sol.
- Look, I'm hungry,
you're tired,

22:15.720 --> 22:16.820
and according to
the group thread,

22:17.010 --> 22:19.480
- James has a solid lead.
- Okay.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.780
Let's just take a break.

22:20.980 --> 22:22.320
Wherever Hank is,
I'm sure he's fine, right?

22:22.520 --> 22:24.160
[Annie] You should've felt
that your pocket was lighter.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.990
Why don't you have
a better sense of balance?

22:26.190 --> 22:27.660
You are being really mean
to someone

22:27.860 --> 22:29.290
who might lose
a testicle to cancer.

22:29.490 --> 22:30.950
That lump is an ingrown hair
and you know it.

22:31.150 --> 22:31.930
[gasps]

22:33.600 --> 22:35.580
All right, here's the deal.

22:35.780 --> 22:36.960
I think we should find the
nearest shop and call it a day.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.590
What? No! Asian Elvis only
works on Saturdays.

22:40.790 --> 22:41.760
Look, the reality is

22:41.960 --> 22:43.510
we're not gonna make it
on time, okay?

22:43.710 --> 22:46.010
Do you guys even really want
to get married today, anyway?

22:46.210 --> 22:47.260
All you've been doing
is fighting.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.720
What fighting?

22:48.920 --> 22:50.930
Oh, you mean what
we were doing in the car?

22:51.130 --> 22:53.020
We don't call that fighting,
we call that spicy talk.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.350
Yeah, when we fight for real,
she makes me cry.

22:55.550 --> 22:58.110
- Oh, baby.
- No, no, no.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.730
Sometimes I need
to learn things.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.110
Mm-hmm.

23:01.310 --> 23:02.320
Mmm.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.650
- [Annie giggles]
- [Andre] All right now.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.910
[Andre] Oh.

23:07.110 --> 23:09.330
- Oh!
- [delighted laugh]

23:09.530 --> 23:10.540
[Andre] I forgot I put it
in that pocket.

23:10.730 --> 23:12.950
See? Everything is good.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.410
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,

23:14.610 --> 23:16.750
we're still about an hour
and a half out from Vegas, okay?

23:16.950 --> 23:19.750
And this dummy tire is really
only meant to be driven

23:19.950 --> 23:21.000
- for about 70 miles max.
- [Andre] No.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.300
It will go all the way.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.090
Besides, I got
to get married tonight.

23:25.290 --> 23:27.890
It's not about
the insurance anymore.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.780
I'm a man in love.

23:31.490 --> 23:32.850
Nice.

23:33.050 --> 23:34.980
So, the dummy tire, right?

23:35.180 --> 23:36.060
Not gonna make it.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.400
We will make it.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.570
Sometimes, you just got
to keep the faith.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.570
- [Andre] You know what, baby?
- [Annie] Mm-hmm.

23:41.770 --> 23:44.280
[Andre] Your man's gonna drive.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.050
[sighs]

23:52.720 --> 23:54.500
That girl is going to be
telling tales about you

23:54.700 --> 23:56.120
for the rest of her life.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.210
I know, right?

23:57.410 --> 24:00.130
I'm like... Joan of NARS.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.270
[both laughing]

24:03.100 --> 24:03.960
Today's been really fun.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.090
Well, the day's not over.

24:05.290 --> 24:06.930
There's a lot more fun
to be had.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.970
Well, once we find Henry.
He's still missing.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.640
Yes, yes, and we should fuel up.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.640
- I raided the mini bar.
- Oh, we can't.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.770
Sol is gonna kill us.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.140
We can and we will.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.290
Jumbo Toblerone?

24:19.620 --> 24:22.110
- Oh, look, it's already open.
- [Lily gasps]

24:22.310 --> 24:23.690
Looks like we have to eat it.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.190
Oh, my God, Nick.

24:26.390 --> 24:29.160
I love you so much. Mmm.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.240
- [clears throat]
- Mmm. <i>Mmm.</i>

24:32.440 --> 24:33.790
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

24:33.980 --> 24:35.140
Mmm.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.060
I've been thinking
about something.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.730
Nick, I...

24:49.230 --> 24:50.480
I think...

24:51.690 --> 24:52.650
[sighs]

24:55.110 --> 24:57.030
...you're my best friend.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.400
Oh.

25:00.590 --> 25:01.950
Thanks. [chuckles]

25:05.710 --> 25:07.710
All right, I need to get ready.

25:18.550 --> 25:20.830
Excuse me, can I get
a napkin, please?

25:21.030 --> 25:22.960
I'm sorry, somebody stole
all of our napkins.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.590
Even the backups
in the storage closet.

25:24.790 --> 25:25.840
We don't know how.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.840
I can get you some toilet paper.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.130
It's okay. Thanks.

25:30.330 --> 25:31.340
That's weird.

25:31.540 --> 25:33.760
Those sweet potato fries
look so good.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.850
But $16? No.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.930
Sol, you have the money.

25:38.130 --> 25:39.180
Why are you--

25:39.380 --> 25:41.730
and I'm just gonna say it--
so stingy?

25:41.930 --> 25:43.520
He asks, with love.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.860
I don't know.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.730
I've never had real
disposable income before.

25:47.930 --> 25:49.570
It just doesn't feel right
to spend it.

25:49.770 --> 25:50.860
What if something happens?

25:51.060 --> 25:52.780
What if my car gets totaled?

25:52.980 --> 25:54.740
Oh, your 2005 Elantra?

25:54.940 --> 25:56.450
- I hope it gets totaled.
- Uh...

25:56.650 --> 25:58.300
Not with you in it.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.290
I just feel like whenever
something good happens,

26:01.490 --> 26:04.080
I'm waiting for the equilibrium
to weigh me back down.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.090
Hmm. I don't know what
that can be.

26:06.290 --> 26:08.300
Not internalized shame
or intergenerational trauma.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.300
Right?

26:09.500 --> 26:10.880
[both laugh]

26:11.080 --> 26:12.010
I don't know.

26:12.210 --> 26:14.180
I don't if you feel
this way, but...

26:14.380 --> 26:17.890
I find myself asking,
as a minority within a minority,

26:18.090 --> 26:19.680
when have I done enough?

26:19.880 --> 26:22.100
Enough to have fun
and feel safe?

26:22.300 --> 26:23.100
And let go?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.190
Yeah.

26:25.390 --> 26:26.690
Like, I feel like
teenage me would think

26:26.890 --> 26:28.020
now me is killing it.
You know?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.530
You are killing it.
I'm so proud of you.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.240
Says the pot calling
the kettle brown.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.160
Sol, you're saving lives.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.700
I'm selling tostadas.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.740
Uh, tostadas save lives, too.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.760
[both laugh]

26:42.600 --> 26:46.330
We're so lucky to have
each other, you know that?

26:46.530 --> 26:48.960
I always knew
I was different, but...

26:49.160 --> 26:50.770
because of you,
I never felt alone.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.800
I remember when you
came out to me,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.340
with your frosted tips.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.010
I knew it.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.220
"I, um,
have a crush on a person,

27:00.420 --> 27:02.480
and that person is...
a boy."

27:02.670 --> 27:03.690
Stop!

27:03.880 --> 27:06.560
- [Sol laughs]
- [Jorge] You are so rude.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.860
God, I miss hanging
out with you.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.070
I know that we are

27:10.270 --> 27:12.400
see-you-in-five-years
busy people,

27:12.600 --> 27:15.110
but can we just make
more time to spend together?

27:15.310 --> 27:16.910
- Please? Like immediately?
- [Sol] Yes.

27:17.110 --> 27:18.570
Please.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.790
So many of my patients
die with regret.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.750
And it's never

27:22.950 --> 27:24.830
"I wish I worked more."

27:25.030 --> 27:27.920
It's usually, "I wish I allowed
myself to be happier."

27:28.120 --> 27:29.860
Dark.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.920
Uh, excuse me?

27:32.120 --> 27:34.670
- Yes.
- Can I get an order of those

27:34.870 --> 27:37.140
overpriced sweet potato
fries, please?

27:37.330 --> 27:39.260
- Of course.
- Hell yeah.

27:39.460 --> 27:40.600
[both laugh]

27:40.800 --> 27:42.270
[♪ Connie Francis:
"Stupid Cupid"]

27:42.460 --> 27:44.680
We're here.
