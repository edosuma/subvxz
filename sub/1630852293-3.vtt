WEBVTT

00:08.400 --> 00:09.560
Come here, honey!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.120
Little rascal, where are you going?

00:18.399 --> 00:19.600
Shall we wake Daddy up?

00:19.679 --> 00:22.359
-Yes. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-Let's go.

00:26.239 --> 00:28.920
Wake him up!

00:29.039 --> 00:34.640
Croissant, croissant, croissant,
croissant!

00:35.880 --> 00:37.439
Daddy!

00:39.079 --> 00:40.439
Well done, love!

00:42.039 --> 00:44.920
-Come here, Daddy.
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.200
Come, Daddy.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.960
-If you were sweeter...
-I want to play the trumpet.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.560
To Daddy?

00:55.079 --> 00:58.320
Wake up, Daddy. Wake up, Daddy.

01:07.599 --> 01:09.920
What seems to be missing,

01:10.039 --> 01:13.120
especially considering
that a fourth housemate is coming,

01:13.519 --> 01:16.519
is a space just for the two of you.

01:17.039 --> 01:20.640
So that you can take care of each other.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.799
If you allow me,
I have a little task for you.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.920
Do a little dance for me.

01:31.079 --> 01:32.159
Go, Mommy.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.400
This will be the game for the weekend.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.520
From morning till the moment
you shut your eyes,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.680
one of you will play the star,

01:41.280 --> 01:44.400
and the other one will be the groupie.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.879
-That means that the groupie...
-Oh! Nice.

01:47.319 --> 01:51.039
-...will do all they can think of...
-You do the star first.

01:51.159 --> 01:54.000
...to make the star happy...

01:54.079 --> 01:55.840
-Okay.
-...since they are their fan.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.519
In doing so, the star has every right
to ask for anything they want.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.760
Obviously, the groupie won't necessarily
be able to do all that star asks for.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.120
But their attitude should be one
that says, "I'll do everything

02:11.199 --> 02:13.759
to take care of the person I adore."

02:14.360 --> 02:17.039
-Are we swapping roles the next day?
-Exactly.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.439
What is this for?

02:19.159 --> 02:22.079
-The star keeps it.
-The star. I'll put it in my pocket.

02:22.159 --> 02:24.599
No, hold on. You'll end up forgetting it.

02:25.439 --> 02:29.439
Anyway, yes. On Saturday it's you
and on Sunday it's me.

02:29.879 --> 02:32.159
-Deal.
-Deal? And vice versa.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.680
-It'll be fun...
-Deal.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.439
Today I'm the star
and you are the groupie, right?

02:37.759 --> 02:40.240
How late are we to film the series?

02:40.879 --> 02:42.759
-An hour and a half.
-Hour and a half...

02:42.879 --> 02:45.879
We'll go downstairs
and you'll say that it's your fault...

02:46.079 --> 02:48.560
-No. I already wrote it's your fault...
-Chiara.

02:48.599 --> 02:52.079
Okay, when you guys see this,
you'll understand it was not my fault.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.800
-It all started with a dog and a bow tie
-Who would have thought?

03:01.879 --> 03:04.759
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

03:05.080 --> 03:06.240
Like a yo-yo

03:06.319 --> 03:09.919
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

03:10.000 --> 03:14.400
So kiss me, silly
And let the show begin

03:14.479 --> 03:17.680
The Ferragnez

03:22.000 --> 03:27.560
You guys know I'm the groupie,
but I behaved like a star, I'm sorry.

03:27.639 --> 03:29.439
We started off on the wrong foot.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.000
-Shall we go?
-Where to?

03:31.079 --> 03:33.759
-Home.
-We're going home, honey. Where to?

03:33.840 --> 03:39.439
After I don't know how long, Fede and I
will spend two days in the mountains.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.000
-All good?
-Yes, I'm all good.

03:43.079 --> 03:44.159
You're all good?

03:44.240 --> 03:48.159
Leone will be in Milan
with his grandparents. He's in good hands.

03:55.719 --> 03:56.719
COURMAYEUR
SATURDAY

03:56.800 --> 04:01.520
One day, he'll be the star and I'll be
his groupie, so I'll do what he wants.

04:01.599 --> 04:02.719
-Welcome.
-Hello.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.039
But the next day,
I'll take revenge as I'll be the star.

04:07.439 --> 04:11.280
I think my wife's authoritarian side
will show up.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.479
We could... order some food here, love.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.240
-Chiara.
-How sad!

04:18.319 --> 04:21.360
Chiara! How is that? Hey, no.
We'll eat here, order something.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.800
-Come on, honey.
-No, Chiara.

04:23.879 --> 04:26.519
Something I might be afraid
he asks me to do...

04:27.040 --> 04:31.759
No, he really won't ask me...
Won't ask me to do anything.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.480
Relaxation to him is staying home
and having no plans.

04:34.759 --> 04:37.040
So pretty here.
Can you take a picture of me?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.439
No, no! I won't... No!

04:39.519 --> 04:42.040
-No, come on, please!
-No, I don't want to.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.920
I'm asking you one thing,
then I'll do anything you want.

04:45.079 --> 04:49.920
But you can't... You're not...
You're not allowed to make requests.

04:55.639 --> 04:57.879
FRANCO AND TATIANA'S HOME
FEDEZ'S PARENTS

05:02.879 --> 05:05.600
-How did you set up the table? I...
-Very well.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
Sure.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.360
Like always.

05:10.639 --> 05:14.560
-Wanna try a green bean, Leo?
-Jesus, Franco, how much salt did you put?

05:15.560 --> 05:16.879
They're so salty.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.759
-Do you eat it? Shall Grandpa eat it?
-He's right. They are salty.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.560
-Overcooked and super salty.
-I can't stand you.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.800
I was 13 when I met Franco,
and he was 16 and a half.

05:32.879 --> 05:37.759
We met at a dance club in the afternoon
and we're still here.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.639
And, obviously, there's a certain level...
of tolerance, by now.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.920
-What pasta did you use?
-I'll use that.

05:44.759 --> 05:48.920
-It's not enough. For us? Are you serious?
-Don't worry.

05:49.439 --> 05:50.639
It's too little.

05:52.079 --> 05:53.079
FRANCO
FEDEZ'S DAD

05:53.159 --> 05:56.519
Always, always. Every minute.
She's never happy with anything.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.120
-Is this fine?
-Just that?

05:58.199 --> 06:00.720
Later I'll give him more,
otherwise it gets cold.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.240
Clearly, you get to know her
and say, "Whatever."

06:03.560 --> 06:06.360
Or you'd have to fight
every five minutes. Not worth it.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.439
Good morning. We would like to order lunch
for two in our room, please.

06:19.519 --> 06:21.680
We would like a polenta concia,

06:21.759 --> 06:24.879
-and my husband would like a vellutata...
-My amazing husband.

06:24.959 --> 06:28.079
-My amazing husband, sorry.
-He's very handsome.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.519
-Come on!
-You don't know how much I love him.

06:31.279 --> 06:35.399
-Tell them.
-You don't know how much I love him.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.279
-Please... Okay, very much. Anyway...
-Very much.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.480
I'm really...
It's such a great privilege...

06:41.560 --> 06:44.040
-Let me order.
-It's a great privilege to order...

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
-It's a great privilege...
-Lunch.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.159
-A vellutata. It's a great honor for me...
-Chiara.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.720
-...to order my husband's lunch.
-Lunch.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.040
I'm sorry.

06:54.959 --> 07:00.920
Being a groupie is kind of a pain.
I don't feel I fit in this role.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.439
-What shall I do?
-Keep going until lunch is here.

07:05.519 --> 07:08.600
No, honey, please!

07:09.160 --> 07:14.240
-Too bad Chiara is not here.
-Who'll have a harder time as a groupie?

07:14.319 --> 07:16.600
I don't know, maybe Chiara.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
MILAN

07:17.759 --> 07:20.920
-You think so? I say Fede.
-It'll be hard. She's also pregnant.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.680
It's not like Fede will ask her
to do weird things. I say Fede.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.959
-He won't obey.
-Will he struggle the most?

07:27.040 --> 07:29.879
Fede's a couch potato.
Chiara'll get bored. She's active.

07:29.959 --> 07:30.959
CHIARA'S SISTER

07:31.040 --> 07:34.959
Even now that she's pregnant,
she wants to do a million things. But...

07:35.079 --> 07:38.279
I think she'll be very cool about it.
Let's see if I won.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.439
If I win the bet, maybe I will also
have a groupie for a day.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.360
-Let's have lunch my way.
-Pneumonia. I don't...

07:45.439 --> 07:48.279
-Please, love, let's talk.
-No, no talking.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.840
-I'm so excited.
-And... Grillo somehow

07:51.920 --> 07:55.079
-supports Mattarella's...
-Love, pay attention.

07:55.159 --> 07:58.840
-Okay. As you wish.
-...appeal about constructors. He says...

07:58.920 --> 07:59.879
What do you think?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.920
-Honey, what do you think?
-That this is the saddest lunch ever.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.639
...so you're saying that Renzi,
at this point...

08:09.160 --> 08:10.680
What about some interaction?

08:13.959 --> 08:16.360
-What would you like to do?
-Take a nap.

08:16.439 --> 08:19.000
Now? Let's go for a walk
and then take a nap.

08:19.079 --> 08:21.920
No, honey, I need to rest now,
I can't go for a walk.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.319
-But it gets dark in one hour.
-What can I do about it?

08:25.959 --> 08:29.519
-When will you go for a walk?
-Then we won't go for a walk.

08:30.279 --> 08:32.480
Chiara, I won't do anything
of what you say, tomorrow.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.080
-I did only things you wanted me to...
-No, no, no. You keep...

08:35.159 --> 08:37.279
-I did...
-You're pulling the strings, today.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.440
She's a terrible groupie.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.639
I've had better.

08:41.759 --> 08:44.759
The nicer you are, the nicer I'll be.
Remember that.

08:45.519 --> 08:47.960
Chiara is saying that Fede is an asshole.

08:48.519 --> 08:52.960
Did you write in the sibling-in-law
group chat saying that I'm an asshole?

08:53.039 --> 08:54.840
-No.
-Chiara!

08:55.080 --> 08:59.480
-That's something extra, love.
-Now write to apologize.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.879
I apologize, Fede is not an asshole.

09:03.399 --> 09:05.120
-Okay.
-She said, "I apologize..."

09:05.200 --> 09:07.519
Because she's the groupie

09:07.639 --> 09:10.759
and she has to do what Fede says.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.639
-Ask her if...
-Chia.

09:12.759 --> 09:17.759
-Did Fede force you to say it?
-Yeah, your audio didn't sound authentic.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.279
It sounded a bit sarcastic.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.399
I'm sleepy. Aren't you?

09:22.480 --> 09:26.759
-No, honey. You even slept in the car...
-I am. I'm really sleepy.

09:27.639 --> 09:29.720
An afternoon packed with excitement.

09:30.159 --> 09:33.440
You think he'll take her somewhere?
I say they'll stay at home.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.519
-Knowing that Fede is rather lazy...
-Yeah, he loves to stay at home.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.440
Fede as a star...

09:40.159 --> 09:44.159
Is not going to end well.
At least that's how I feel about it.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.759
You look horrible in that. What are they?

09:49.279 --> 09:51.200
-Horrible.
-They are my PJs.

09:51.399 --> 09:56.320
I can't tell how much Fede sleeps daily.
He naps in the afternoon, more than Leo.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.759
You're naked. A naked man!

09:58.879 --> 10:01.320
-There's a naked man.
-You're a naked man.

10:01.399 --> 10:05.639
Whereas I am much livelier.
I want to do tons of stuff.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.519
So, it takes as little patience, yes.

10:08.639 --> 10:09.759
Stay a while, please.

10:09.879 --> 10:12.480
No, please. Stay with me.

10:14.519 --> 10:17.600
It seems that you struggled
to follow his rules.

10:17.639 --> 10:21.240
Yes. Yes, because I felt
everything was a bit boring.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.600
Because of how I am,
I would have appreciated more orders

10:24.639 --> 10:29.360
and to do more stuff, clearly,
rather than going at his pace.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.759
I had a hard time following his pace.

10:31.879 --> 10:34.720
I am very active,
always eager to do things.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.519
So when he follows my lead,

10:37.639 --> 10:41.639
he thinks I do too much and vice versa.
On this matter we are very...

10:41.720 --> 10:43.759
-Imbalanced.
-Imbalanced, yes.

10:43.840 --> 10:48.480
Okay. So a bit bored and, if I understand
correctly what you're saying,

10:49.120 --> 10:52.440
-a bit irritated.
-Yes, irritated, too.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.519
-Shall we go at 9:00?
-At 9:00? Please!

10:58.039 --> 11:01.440
-We can eat at 9:00.
-What do we do the next two hours here?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.720
Chill.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.080
You chilled the whole afternoon.

11:05.159 --> 11:08.200
Do I have to... Don't I get to do whatever
the fuck I want today?

11:08.279 --> 11:10.919
But you're busting my balls
even more than usual.

11:11.159 --> 11:12.480
I mean...

11:13.480 --> 11:17.000
-You're not even up for an aperitif?
-An aperitif?

11:17.080 --> 11:20.879
-It's just to have a drink. Jeez, honey!
-I don't want aperitif.

11:21.320 --> 11:26.000
I don't want to do this game anymore.
It's more annoying when I decide...

11:26.559 --> 11:29.879
-What the hell. You're a pain in the ass.
-Jeez...

11:29.960 --> 11:34.120
-Fede, you've been sleeping since 4:00.
-So what? What do you want?

11:34.679 --> 11:35.559
Is it a crime?

11:35.679 --> 11:38.960
-No, but...
-Do you care to eat at 9:00 or at 7:00...

11:39.039 --> 11:40.360
Let's eat at 7:30.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.399
-I didn't say 7:30.
-So when do you want to eat?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.639
-Never mind.
-When do you want to eat?

11:45.879 --> 11:47.039
Forget it.

11:48.159 --> 11:53.279
Please, tell me, you're stressing me out.
What time do you want to eat?

11:54.879 --> 11:56.080
Let's go at 9:00.

11:56.159 --> 11:59.919
No, let's go at 8:00.
We eat at 8:00. Good God!

12:02.639 --> 12:07.039
How did you feel
the moment things started to escalate?

12:07.279 --> 12:09.879
When he yelled at you like that?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.879
What happens to you, emotionally?

12:15.080 --> 12:18.399
I feel lost, maybe. I don't know.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.639
I feel anxious about...

12:22.519 --> 12:26.600
Getting over... Once the angry phase
is gone... Phase which I...

12:26.679 --> 12:29.960
You are anxious about getting
immediately over with the problem.

12:30.559 --> 12:32.559
What's wrong?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.840
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, is something wrong?

12:36.879 --> 12:40.639
I understand that you want
to clear the air right away...

12:40.720 --> 12:42.200
Yes, because it's horrible...

12:42.279 --> 12:46.879
-The next day I feel terrible.
-Yes, but on the other side there's me

12:47.240 --> 12:52.039
telling you, "Not now!" The more you
do it, the more you add fuel to the fire.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.639
-This is a big conflict.
-Neither of us is right.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.720
Being right is not the point.
This is how it is.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.399
When you are not reassured by Federico,

13:02.480 --> 13:07.200
what happens in you when you feel lost?
How old are you emotionally?

13:07.799 --> 13:12.440
I feel like a little girl. A little girl
panicking about the first fights,

13:13.039 --> 13:15.679
which I find too intense, perhaps.

13:15.759 --> 13:20.279
-Your teen or pre-teen side gets upset.
-Sure.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.480
Can you go back to that time
to show me what happens to you?

13:23.559 --> 13:27.320
Well, yeah, because my parents
broke up in a very sudden way,

13:27.399 --> 13:30.320
so in those years I had all my...

13:31.440 --> 13:35.879
How can I say it? My first big fights
happened at that time, so that is...

13:35.960 --> 13:38.320
In that moment I realized that...

13:39.679 --> 13:41.480
God, I... I'm getting nervous.

13:41.559 --> 13:44.000
-You're not saying anything bad.
-Sure, no.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.799
-What? You were hit by a wave of emotions.
-Oh, yes...

13:46.879 --> 13:50.799
What did we learn? If such a wave comes,
do you block it and rationalize it?

13:50.879 --> 13:53.720
No, no, no. You're right.

13:56.320 --> 14:01.039
So... When I realized that my parents...

14:01.120 --> 14:04.600
What makes you cry, Chiara?
And you listen carefully.

14:04.759 --> 14:08.000
I was the oldest so I always felt that,

14:08.080 --> 14:11.840
in a moment when my parents
were a bit lost and doing whatever...

14:12.679 --> 14:13.960
I don't know.

14:14.039 --> 14:19.080
-You had to be a mom to your sisters.
-Yes.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.039
And perhaps a mom to her own parents.

14:22.399 --> 14:26.399
Exactly. You had to be an adult
for everybody and fix everything.

14:27.559 --> 14:32.600
I focused so much on how I could
fix things and what I could do.

14:32.679 --> 14:37.519
Okay, listen to all the emotions coming up
and you stay close to her.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.039
-If I see her crying, I feel like crying.
-Be close to her.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.440
-Be close.
-I don't wanna cry. Leave me alone.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.279
Stay close, Federico.

14:52.879 --> 14:55.559
-What do I do?
-You don't have to do anything.

14:55.639 --> 14:59.639
She's the one fixing everything.
You just stay close.

15:03.759 --> 15:04.919
Don't cry.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.759
Let him cry.
It's his way to say that he's sorry.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.279
That he loves you.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.519
The aim is for you to really know
how to take care of each other.

15:20.039 --> 15:25.919
As they say, "To love, honor, and respect
for better or for worse."

15:28.519 --> 15:30.360
Twenty minutes left.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.879
SATURDAY
CHIARA'S LAST MINUTES AS GROUPIE

15:32.960 --> 15:36.399
Then you'll be my groupie.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.399
Do you want something?

15:39.720 --> 15:40.799
Huh?

15:42.799 --> 15:43.840
Honey?

15:44.559 --> 15:45.679
Come on!

15:47.399 --> 15:48.600
Are you ready?

15:49.720 --> 15:51.120
You look like you're dying.

15:53.679 --> 15:55.039
I'm touching my balls.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.360
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.919
COURMAYEUR - SUNDAY
STAR & GROUPIE

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Thanks.

16:08.039 --> 16:11.120
Day two. I'm the star
and I'm very happy about it.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.360
No, I'll do it.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.080
Fede, now it's my turn.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.320
I planned some small activities.

16:19.759 --> 16:21.799
-Wanna hear?
-Tell me, if you want.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.519
We'll go see some animals.

16:25.879 --> 16:26.879
Nice.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.639
But first, you'll call my mom.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.759
-No, come on. I can call your dad.
-No, mom.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.679
-I can call your dad.
-No, mom.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.879
You should tell her sweet things.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.480
Such as you're happy to see her tonight.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.399
All grandparents,
but dad are over at ours.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.960
When we get back. With Leo.

16:52.240 --> 16:56.279
I find it embarrassing.
It's not that... I can't be bothered.

16:56.559 --> 16:58.279
-Call her. Come on!
-No.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.840
I call her and insult her.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.639
Fede! Call her and be nice.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.000
-I can do this because I love Marina.
-Good boy.

17:09.799 --> 17:13.079
-You should tell her "I love you."
-I haven't saved her number.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.759
Fede, save it. Look it up in the chat.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.799
-"Marina Chiara's Mom?"
-I guess so.

17:24.039 --> 17:26.079
She'll worry when she sees your number.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.039
-Hello?
-Hi, Marina. How are you? Good morning.

17:31.559 --> 17:35.079
-Hi, good morning. I'm fine, and you?
-Fine, yeah, fine.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.319
I'll see you tonight at 6:00, right?

17:38.640 --> 17:42.000
Yes, yes. She told me to come

17:42.079 --> 17:45.640
as soon as the little one
was back with your parents...

17:45.720 --> 17:49.160
I was calling to ask if you know
where Silvia Righicolle's hat is.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.480
IT'S A FRIEND'S HAT

17:50.559 --> 17:54.680
-No way...
-Maybe you put it in your purse. No?

17:55.559 --> 17:58.880
-No, also because...
-Getting there, I have to go around it.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.039
-Tell her.
-...that I changed...

18:01.079 --> 18:06.200
Okay, then. I'm calling mom, too.
We can't find it and they want it back.

18:06.319 --> 18:10.160
-Okay. I'm sorry.
-Listen, Marina, I take this chance

18:10.240 --> 18:13.240
to tell you that I love you very much,

18:13.319 --> 18:16.920
I admire you a lot and I'm happy
to see you often these days.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.079
-How sweet of you!
-Don't mention it, Marina.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.759
I cared to let you know.

18:22.799 --> 18:25.640
You're so nice. Thank you, Fede.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.880
I'm also very happy to have the chance
to see you often, spend time with you guys

18:30.960 --> 18:34.960
and share some moments together.
Amazing. Thank you so much.

18:35.039 --> 18:38.720
-Hopefully, there'll be more. See you.
-Thanks. Fantastic.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.000
-Thank you, Fede.
-Hugs, Marina.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.559
-A big kiss. Bye.
-Bye.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.319
-Say hi to Chiara. Bye.
-Hugs, bye.

18:47.319 --> 18:50.160
-Well done.
-No, it was easy because...

18:50.880 --> 18:54.799
That's true. But usually you don't express
your feelings this well.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.759
It cracks me up that it made
her so happy. "How... How sweet."

18:59.759 --> 19:04.559
I don't know why she made me call...
I am not a person who...

19:04.640 --> 19:09.440
Chiara's mom is a person
who expresses through the body

19:09.519 --> 19:12.079
and words about her desire to love.

19:12.559 --> 19:13.559
I don't.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.680
How excited are you?

19:18.759 --> 19:21.000
It's nice to make
new experiences together.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.200
Right?

19:24.519 --> 19:25.519
You look so happy.

19:26.559 --> 19:28.799
You're bursting with happiness.

19:30.559 --> 19:32.039
Where the fuck are we going?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.960
See? This is Courmayeur, love.

19:36.319 --> 19:37.759
It's beautiful here!

19:38.440 --> 19:39.559
Very beautiful.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.759
-I have to poop.
-Hold it in, honey.

19:43.799 --> 19:45.799
-There must be a toilet.
-Okay, but...

19:45.920 --> 19:48.960
-How can you poop five times a day?
-I just need to.

19:49.039 --> 19:50.559
-Jeez.
-What can I do?

19:54.480 --> 19:55.720
How nice.

19:56.079 --> 20:00.640
Excuse me, is there a toilet around here?
I might need to poop at some point.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.319
Okay, but wait a second. Jeez, honey.

20:03.799 --> 20:05.400
-Good morning.
-Hi!

20:05.480 --> 20:08.799
-Hello. Honey, make those sounds of yours.
-Little goats!

20:14.240 --> 20:16.160
Good. I'm satisfied, honey, and you?

20:16.240 --> 20:18.440
Fede is a good groupie.

20:18.519 --> 20:19.519
I'm set.

20:19.559 --> 20:20.640
Or maybe not.

20:22.079 --> 20:23.079
I need to poop.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.440
-They are so pretty.
-I'll take you to the horses.

20:26.519 --> 20:29.920
Bye, cuties! We'll come back with our son.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.880
He loves animals.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.160
-He looks like a little Dalmatian.
-They're so cute.

20:35.759 --> 20:38.319
Let's run. Ready, steady, go!
Let's go, let's go!

20:38.519 --> 20:39.799
Let's go, let's go!

20:41.720 --> 20:43.400
-No, no, no!
-Olly!

20:44.319 --> 20:47.319
-Go...
-Can you stop inciting her?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.200
-Did you like this experience?
-Lots.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.920
Goats and ponies, nice.
Already seen them. Nice. Goats and ponies.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.079
All right.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.680
-What do you want to do later?
-Go have lunch.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.079
Where are we eating?

21:05.920 --> 21:07.960
-It's a surprise.
-Come on, honey!

21:08.039 --> 21:10.319
In a private room somewhere else.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.880
-In a hotel?
-Yes.

21:15.799 --> 21:17.400
God, it's so cold!

21:17.720 --> 21:19.240
It's nice to be back.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.279
-Good morning.
-Good morning and welcome back.

21:22.319 --> 21:25.079
The most important
family member is missing.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.799
-The dog? I know, we left her...
-No, what dog?

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
-Leo.
-Welcome back.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.480
Thank you very much.

21:30.559 --> 21:32.319
I'll go get the glove.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.000
Okay, but climb up properly.

21:34.079 --> 21:35.279
I'm Fiaderman.

21:35.319 --> 21:36.400
I'm Fiaderman.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.559
-Come on, go upstairs.
-Franco.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.319
Did you tell Leo that this was
Federico's room when he was little?

21:42.440 --> 21:43.440
Yeah.

21:43.519 --> 21:48.039
Federico lived here until he was
18-20 years old. He started in here.

21:48.079 --> 21:49.880
Daddy's photo.

21:50.279 --> 21:53.000
So ugly! Ugly, ugly, ugly.

21:53.319 --> 21:58.759
I remember him walking down the stairs
saying, "Mom, this guy wrote me,"

21:58.839 --> 22:04.480
"Mom, this other guy wrote..."
It makes you think of Federico's journey.

22:04.559 --> 22:07.160
What a big hand you have! How is it?

22:08.759 --> 22:10.880
Well done. Look what Fiaderman does.

22:12.319 --> 22:15.720
-What funny video did I take here?
-You while eating.

22:15.799 --> 22:17.640
-Can I eat it?
-Leo eats! No!

22:18.839 --> 22:22.720
-I just want to try it.
-No, no, no! It's Leo's.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.000
A small piece!

22:24.319 --> 22:27.519
Look. We met a little goat.

22:27.799 --> 22:30.079
The piece of meringue cake
we had last time.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.079
I've seen that stuff 70,000 times.
I don't know why she shows it again.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.519
Love, you can't avoid it today.

22:37.599 --> 22:39.279
-Will you sing me a song?
-Okay.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.759
-Let's sing Shallow. I'm Bradley Cooper.
-Okay.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.160
It's long. Three, two, one.
Fuck, I'm stressed.

22:49.839 --> 22:51.519
-No.
-"Tell me something girl."

22:59.920 --> 23:01.079
Shallow was very nice.

23:08.599 --> 23:09.599
Well done!

23:09.680 --> 23:10.839
I hope Gaga sees it.

23:20.039 --> 23:21.319
I'm doing the harmony.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.880
Keep going!

23:26.960 --> 23:28.519
Put your finger in to hear better.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.240
After this indescribable performance,

23:34.319 --> 23:38.480
I'd say I'm ready to duet with him
at Sanremo. Forget Francesca. Poor girl!

23:44.559 --> 23:49.119
-That was amazing! Well done!
-I smell a Grammy.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.279
You spat in my face.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.160
-God. I can't take it anymore.
-Smile.

24:00.599 --> 24:03.559
The weekend was very nice, very exciting.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.759
Especially the day I chose the activities,
meaning today.

24:06.839 --> 24:08.480
A bit... Can you lift me up?

24:08.559 --> 24:10.440
And now back to Milan.

24:10.599 --> 24:15.240
-Holy shit. No, no, Chiara. Don't...
-Good God!

24:15.319 --> 24:16.319
Yes, Leo.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.640
He's all crazy.

24:27.960 --> 24:33.640
Tati, when will you be home? We'll be
there around 19:45. We're leaving now.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.319
Everything went well. See you later.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.079
-Grandpa, did you take the car keys?
-Yes.

24:39.359 --> 24:42.519
Let's go. Don't drop the blankets, okay?

24:42.599 --> 24:44.839
It was fun. Today way more than yesterday.

24:45.359 --> 24:49.880
We are going home, where Fede's parents,
my mom, and Leo are waiting for us.

24:51.559 --> 24:56.400
-I can't believe it! Fiaderman! Fiaderman!
-Hi!

24:56.480 --> 24:59.440
-Hi!
-Hi, little one!

24:59.519 --> 25:02.319
-Fiaderman!
-Come here, come here!

25:02.400 --> 25:04.160
Where is the little one going?

25:04.240 --> 25:07.119
Where is he going? Fiaderman!

25:08.119 --> 25:10.799
Take off your coat, Leo. No, come here.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.440
I'd like a roast chicken.

25:17.519 --> 25:19.000
Chicken yucky!

25:19.119 --> 25:21.000
-Can you do it?
-Something's burning.

25:21.079 --> 25:23.680
It's the frittata, it's not burning.

25:23.759 --> 25:27.240
-I wanna see you flip it.
-I don't flip the one with potatoes.

25:27.319 --> 25:31.480
What are you saying?
It stays raw. No, it sucks.

25:31.559 --> 25:33.279
Go over the sink, or...

25:35.839 --> 25:39.440
See? Did you see that? Go over the sink!

25:39.519 --> 25:41.039
I can't stand you anymore.

25:42.359 --> 25:44.039
Why did you make me flip it?

25:44.920 --> 25:47.440
-It was perfect.
-Let's see who's there. Come, Leo.

25:48.119 --> 25:49.839
Come. Come and see...

25:50.319 --> 25:51.799
Hi!

25:52.480 --> 25:54.559
-He's there. Doesn't want to come.
-Why?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.000
He's playing.

25:56.079 --> 25:59.240
-Hi, love! Hi!
-Mom and Dad are here.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.759
-Hi, Gennaro!
-Hi, my love! Did you have fun?

26:04.839 --> 26:06.920
-Yes!
-Give Daddy a hug, too!

26:07.119 --> 26:08.119
Go!

26:11.920 --> 26:14.079
-Hi, my love!
-Were you playing, honey?

26:15.559 --> 26:18.720
-Hi!
-Hi, love. How are you? Did you have fun?

26:18.799 --> 26:20.519
Yes. We're tired, but it was nice.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.000
-Hi, baby. Hi, Fede.
-Hi.

26:24.079 --> 26:25.359
-Did you miss me?
-Yes.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.119
A lot? How much on a scale
from one to ten?

26:28.200 --> 26:29.799
-Two.
-Two? Great.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.839
Great. It's already a lot.

26:34.279 --> 26:40.240
-In a way, you both failed as groupies.
-Yes.

26:40.519 --> 26:43.680
Neither of you managed

26:44.000 --> 26:46.640
to make the other feel like a star.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.000
-That's true.
-That would have underlined your need

26:50.079 --> 26:53.720
to know that you have each other's back.

26:53.799 --> 26:58.799
And you wish, I can feel it,
for this to be a true love story.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.920
One that lasts.

27:01.480 --> 27:06.039
Today, you're getting ready
to have a daughter, a second child,

27:06.119 --> 27:10.440
which adds more complexity,
stress, tension... In order to do this,

27:10.519 --> 27:14.720
we need to heal from our wounds
that make us destructive.

27:16.839 --> 27:18.079
Both of you.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.640
Till next time. Get ready, Federico.
We'll talk about you.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.839
Yes.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.599
My greatest enemy is myself.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.519
-All right. Thank you, doctor.
-God, I can't move.

27:28.599 --> 27:31.400
-It's a fight against myself.
-Come, Ferri.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.839
My shadows, my contradictions.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.440
Grandma, how will Sanremo go?

27:41.559 --> 27:43.240
Sanremo? Okay.

27:44.119 --> 27:46.240
-Okay what?
-Will go well.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.359
You will know it before anybody else
via a phone call.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.759
What?

27:51.839 --> 27:53.559
-That I win?
-Something.

27:54.720 --> 27:55.839
It's a phone call.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.119
I SMELL DISQUALIFICATION

27:57.519 --> 28:01.720
Misstep for Fedez, who reveals
part of the song he will take to Sanremo,

28:01.799 --> 28:04.920
going against the rules
that ask for unpublished pieces.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.559
-Hi, how are you?
-What's up?

28:06.640 --> 28:10.200
-I'm sorry to bother you. Sorry.
-Don't worry.

28:13.119 --> 28:14.559
-Incredible.
-It's very...

28:14.640 --> 28:17.079
-I wanted to have a chill Sanremo.
-Honey...

28:17.160 --> 28:20.279
I wanted a calm
and drama-free experience, but no.

28:20.359 --> 28:22.119
You'll never have that in life.

28:26.759 --> 28:28.160
We'll update you tomorrow.
