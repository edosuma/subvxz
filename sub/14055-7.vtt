Previously on The O.C.

00:01.664 --> 00:03.368
Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?

00:03.468 --> 00:05.374
He is like Newport's Prince William.

00:05.474 --> 00:09.210
I get nervous, and I start talking,
and then nothing can shut me up.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.175
Except that.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.926
I have missed you all day.
Does this count as adultery?

00:14.011 --> 00:15.859
You're not, like,
becoming friends, are you?

00:15.873 --> 00:16.715
Would that be so terrible?

00:16.815 --> 00:17.976
Really? You don't go to school?

00:18.076 --> 00:22.381
I got kicked out. Of Corona, Mater Dei
and even Newport Union.

00:22.461 --> 00:27.722
16 years ago I made an error in judgment,
one that almost ruined my marriage.

00:28.025 --> 00:29.792
You're my father?

00:36.780 --> 00:39.697
- Hey, man, what's going on?
- Studying.

00:39.797 --> 00:42.748
Would you punch someone, please,
for old time's sake?

00:43.637 --> 00:47.147
All right, fine, logarithms are
the new uppercut, I got it.

00:49.611 --> 00:52.551
- Wow. Now I see it.
- See what?

00:52.772 --> 00:54.427
I been looking through
old photos of my mom,

00:54.464 --> 00:57.414
looking for resemblances to Lindsay.
Look at that.

00:57.429 --> 00:59.602
Are you trying to make this
more awkward for me?

00:59.803 --> 01:02.320
What? It's not like you dating
Lindsay's full-on incest

01:02.321 --> 01:04.524
you're not even really related.
You're not--

01:04.623 --> 01:07.650
you wouldn't get arrested, you wouldn't
have chromosomally challenged children.

01:07.750 --> 01:12.031
Kirsten's, like, my mom.
Lindsay is... clearly her sister.

01:12.131 --> 01:13.209
It is kind of weird.

01:13.309 --> 01:16.534
The fact that your mom doesn't know that
I'm dating her sister, it's a lot weird.

01:16.634 --> 01:19.197
I think they did a storyline
like this on The Valley once.

01:19.404 --> 01:20.917
Great, could you tell me
how it ends, then?

01:21.017 --> 01:23.204
Well, you just have to ask
yourself the question, Ryan:

01:23.348 --> 01:25.872
is she your girlfriend,
or is she your aunt?

01:25.884 --> 01:28.313
Ah, yes, the age-old question.

01:28.413 --> 01:30.827
That's right.
it's a story as old as time, really.

01:31.068 --> 01:32.767
Boy meets girl, boy likes girl,

01:32.867 --> 01:36.611
boy finds out girl is surrogate mother's
illegitimate half-sister.

01:36.751 --> 01:40.043
I'm guessing it's too soon
to joke, Seth, even for a Cohen.

01:40.224 --> 01:42.868
I just don't know what to do,
you know? What to say.

01:42.968 --> 01:44.189
Well, have you talked to Lindsay?

01:44.289 --> 01:47.871
Nah, wanted to give her space over winter
break, let her figure everything out.

01:47.971 --> 01:49.353
That's all you can do.

01:49.469 --> 01:52.318
And if she comes back and decides
she wants to be part of this family...

01:52.418 --> 01:53.689
Then we're done dating, huh?

01:53.789 --> 01:56.027
Unless you want to move to the South.

01:56.368 --> 01:57.943
Kirsten doesn't know
you're seeing Lindsay, right?

01:58.043 --> 01:58.901
She thinks we're just friends.

01:59.001 --> 02:02.420
Good, 'cause I think it's best
that the Mrs. doesn't find out.

02:02.508 --> 02:05.556
Well, that's something that
every wife wants to hear.

02:06.076 --> 02:10.138
- Doesn't find out what?
- How much I love you?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.553
- Sandy?
- Yes?

02:11.653 --> 02:13.553
You don't have to lie to me.

02:13.661 --> 02:17.163
I know that Renee's testimony is today,
and that my father is going free.

02:17.165 --> 02:19.071
- Yeah.
- Sharp as a tack.

02:19.071 --> 02:20.713
Just, it's, like, a laser beam.

02:20.813 --> 02:22.806
But that doesn't mean
I have to forgive him.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.876
Not after what he did
to Lindsay, that poor girl.

02:27.198 --> 02:30.838
I've been thinking.
We should do something for her.

02:31.114 --> 02:36.172
This girl grew up not knowing who she is
or where she's from, and we're her family.

02:36.207 --> 02:38.223
- If she wants us.
- Oh, she wants us.

02:38.256 --> 02:39.415
I mean... you guys.

02:39.515 --> 02:43.244
Well, you, too, Ryan-- you're as much
a part of this family as any of us.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.847
I mean, if she's my sister,
she's your aunt.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.603
Well, thanks for clearing
that one up, honey.

02:47.703 --> 02:50.560
Actually, she's so young,
she's more like your sister.

02:50.783 --> 02:54.437
Oh. Hey, a sister.
I always wanted one of those.

02:54.795 --> 02:56.927
Ryan, how about you?

Don't worry about it,
'cause it's no biggie.

03:31.443 --> 03:32.813
What are you talking about?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.572
When Seth met your dad,
it almost ended the relationship.

03:36.485 --> 03:39.239
Well, DJ meeting your dad can't be worse
than when he met your mom.

03:39.339 --> 03:42.012
I suppose this time
he will be wearing clothes.

03:42.590 --> 03:46.658
I don't know, DJ without
his clothes on? Pretty undeniable.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.126
Look, it'll be fine. Your dad's
totally chill. He won't judge.

03:50.226 --> 03:52.782
It's just, he's the only
sane person in my family,

03:52.897 --> 03:55.442
the only one who comes
even close to getting me.

03:55.810 --> 04:00.010
And I really want him to like DJ.

04:01.864 --> 04:05.081
- Oh, hey, Seth. What's up, man?
- Hey! What's going on, man?

04:05.316 --> 04:08.424
- Did you get my Christmas card?
- I did. I appreciate the apology.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.292
So, uh, we're friends again, then?

04:10.392 --> 04:13.153
We're real men, okay?
Red-blooded meat eaters.

04:13.394 --> 04:16.183
Occasionally from time to time we're
going to brawl. It's our nature.

04:16.283 --> 04:18.926
So we can talk about stuff,
confidential stuff, and it's cool?

04:19.026 --> 04:19.805
Yeah, listen, man,

04:19.858 --> 04:23.094
after all the trouble I caused, I'm happy
to have a chance to help, so come on.

04:25.259 --> 04:27.973
while I was in Cabo with my family,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.073
uh, I ran into an old girlfriend,

04:30.163 --> 04:36.921
and, uh, we were at Squid Row,
late, and, uh, we kind of kissed.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.313
All right, well, first question, um...

04:40.555 --> 04:42.861
this old flame, do you still
have feelings for her?

04:43.077 --> 04:45.702
Well, I really like her kids.

04:45.923 --> 04:50.819
Uh, she's a little older than me.
She was my math tutor when I was 14.

04:51.363 --> 04:53.960
Holy... '80s teen comedy plot.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.426
She's in the middle of a divorce,

04:55.526 --> 04:57.834
she had had a lot of tequila,
Chingy was playing...

04:57.934 --> 05:01.355
Oh. Chingy and tequila.
Seduction has no two finer allies.

05:01.455 --> 05:04.927
It was just a quick kiss, and then I,
like, ran out of there, but...

05:05.193 --> 05:06.740
I feel really guilty.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.199
Well, man, if it was anybody else,
I would say keep it to yourself,

05:11.267 --> 05:12.677
you'll lead a much happier life.

05:12.777 --> 05:13.626
No, I can't do that, man.

05:13.726 --> 05:16.113
I know-- because you have
a conscience, whatever,

05:16.194 --> 05:18.428
so you got to be
honest with Summer, then.

05:19.049 --> 05:20.471
Tell her you feel terrible,

05:20.581 --> 05:24.323
and tell her that all it did was make
you realize how much you like her.

05:24.340 --> 05:27.618
And definitely do not mention the ex
having kids and multiple divorces.

05:27.638 --> 05:29.047
- You should be fine.
- You think so?

05:29.048 --> 05:30.227
- Yeah, you'll be good.

05:30.391 --> 05:32.085
And you're not gonna
tell anyone, are you?

05:32.086 --> 05:37.556
Zach... even if I wanted to,
the code, it dictates... I cannot.

05:47.885 --> 05:50.913
- How was your vacation? /
- How have you been?

05:53.674 --> 05:56.660
- I wanted to call you.
- No, I'm glad you didn't.

05:58.047 --> 06:01.210
I-I mean, I wanted to talk to you, but...

06:01.363 --> 06:03.767
I haven't really been in the frame
of mind to talk to anyone about anything.

06:03.867 --> 06:04.892
Not even your mom?

06:04.892 --> 06:10.037
Uh, not until I've completed several
hundred hours of intense psychotherapy.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.644
Which was a very thoughtful
gift from her, by the way.

06:12.744 --> 06:14.818
Well, if you need some more time.
I mean,

06:15.046 --> 06:17.165
if you don't want to hang out
right now, uh, or ever.

06:17.265 --> 06:21.916
Uh, I-I do. We just need to find our
own personal Switzerland.

06:22.016 --> 06:24.159
Someplace neutral.

06:24.359 --> 06:28.013
And we can't hang out at my house
'cause my mom's there,

06:28.295 --> 06:30.963
- and... we can't hang out at your house..
- Because your sister's there?

06:31.227 --> 06:36.508
She's not my, um... I mean, I guess
technically she is, but...

06:36.608 --> 06:39.253
Just so I can be clear on what
everybody is to everybody:

06:39.335 --> 06:42.447
- you and the Cohens?
- Friends. They're my friends.

06:42.547 --> 06:46.995
- And me and you ?
- More than friends ?

06:47.427 --> 06:50.539
- More than friends.
- And definitely not related.

06:50.649 --> 06:52.935
I don't want this to be like
kissing your sister.

06:53.035 --> 06:55.601
The thought never crossed my mind.

06:58.355 --> 07:01.164
I got to tell you, Sanford,
you're one hell of a lawyer.

07:01.538 --> 07:02.846
The charges have been dropped,

07:03.298 --> 07:07.382
and the secrets of our situation
sealed by the courts.

07:07.505 --> 07:09.820
You did it. I'm a free man.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.432
And a smug one, too.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.559
Excuse me for wringing a little joy out of the
one bitof good news I've had for some time.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.214
Well, never mind the fact that the news
came at the expense of your family.

07:19.682 --> 07:22.719
Or did you fail to notice Kirsten's absence
at the hearing this morning?

07:22.703 --> 07:25.526
I know I've got some work to do
on my relationship with my daughter.

07:25.626 --> 07:27.534
Now, which daughter
are we talking about?

07:27.634 --> 07:29.944
I'm not saying it's gonna
be easy with Kirsten.

07:30.044 --> 07:32.388
Once I get back to work,
I can lighten her load...

07:32.488 --> 07:34.640
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Back to work?

07:34.740 --> 07:36.948
Now that the scandal's gone,
there's no reason for me

07:37.048 --> 07:38.689
to distance myself from
the Newport Group.

07:38.789 --> 07:41.961
Except for the fact that the woman
running the company hates you.

07:42.074 --> 07:43.409
Which woman are we talking about?

07:43.509 --> 07:46.781
Well, I hope he's not expecting
a party in his honor.

07:47.694 --> 07:51.566
Yeah, I'll... I'll see
you back at the office. Bye, Kirsten.

07:51.918 --> 07:54.519
- He's free?
- He's free.

07:56.116 --> 07:59.214
I might have to spike these drinks.
I don't know if they're strong enough.

07:59.863 --> 08:03.505
He, uh... he won't serve any jail time.
That's it. It's just...

08:03.605 --> 08:06.258
Over?

08:06.606 --> 08:11.744
What are we talking about here, Jimmy,
Caleb...  or us?

08:12.892 --> 08:15.352
Definitely not strong enough.

08:17.109 --> 08:24.960
Well, I should get back to the office,
back to my life, huh?

08:33.011 --> 08:35.615
But what if it wasn't my life?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.215
What if I could just walk away from it?

08:38.315 --> 08:41.893
Well, that would depend
on what you're walking to.

08:50.425 --> 08:55.340
Maybe we just needed this time apart
to appreciate each other, what we had.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.687
But what if we...
can't ever have it again?

08:58.852 --> 09:03.287
I'm willing to find out if you are.

09:18.666 --> 09:22.432
Hi. I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this.

09:22.509 --> 09:24.196
I was wondering if I could
give you a ride home.

09:24.296 --> 09:27.710
Oh, uh, thanks, but I have a car.

09:27.810 --> 09:30.974
A-And there's a better than
50/50 chance it'll actually start.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.805
Well, I know there's no right way
to do this, FTD doesn't make a...

09:34.890 --> 09:37.094
Happy Surprise Sister bouquet?

09:37.525 --> 09:40.349
And, uh, I know you're not on the market
for any new relatives, but...

09:40.417 --> 09:41.557
how about a friend?

09:41.651 --> 09:43.991
We could go grab
a friendly cup of coffee.

09:44.296 --> 09:47.364
Yeah, a friendly cup
of coffee would be cool.

09:47.992 --> 09:51.452
You have nothing to be nervous about.
It's gonna be great.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.501
What's he into?
Does he like sports?

09:53.626 --> 09:56.861
Uh, he really likes ESPN Classics.

09:57.758 --> 10:00.718
Is that your mom?

10:15.982 --> 10:21.475
Alex, it's Seth. Come on,
I came over to welcome you back.

10:24.137 --> 10:26.965
You've really changed over break. Wow.

10:27.121 --> 10:30.674
- Who are you?
- Uh, just, um, a guy.

10:30.774 --> 10:32.582
I probably have the wrong
apartment. Sorry.

10:32.482 --> 10:37.744
Seth?
What are you doing here?

10:37.844 --> 10:40.321
I came over to say hi,
see how your vacation was.

10:40.645 --> 10:42.265
Didn't realize I needed
to bring my own tourniquet.

10:42.365 --> 10:45.994
Sorry, I just...
I didn't expect you to be here.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.385
Especially so early in the morning.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.533
It's 3:30 in the afternoon.

10:50.642 --> 10:53.606
Family vacations really
take it out of you, huh?

10:53.724 --> 10:56.005
Oh, yeah. I bailed on family early.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.446
I just came back to catch up
with old friends.

10:58.546 --> 11:03.084
Wait, so you've been back for a while
and you didn't... I don't know, call me?

11:03.138 --> 11:05.365
I've been catching up with old friends.

11:05.453 --> 11:08.349
Who, the large shirtless guy
that answered the door...

11:08.572 --> 11:10.235
he asked, not remotely jealous.

11:10.335 --> 11:11.521
You know, I am...

11:11.688 --> 11:13.931
- so hung over right now. I just think...
- Are you?

11:14.015 --> 11:15.227
Well, have you...
have you eaten anything?

11:15.527 --> 11:18.654
You want me to maybe put some coffee on
or fix you a sandwich?

11:18.795 --> 11:20.209
Fix me a sandwich?

11:20.821 --> 11:27.866
Hey, Alex, we're going to go grab some smokes
and some more beers, we'll be right back.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.723
Okay. Okay, I'm trying to do the math here
and, uh... well, I have a few questions.

11:33.823 --> 11:38.505
I will answer all of your questions tonight
at the Modest Mouse concert, okay?

11:38.931 --> 11:43.638
It's just, my head is killing me and...
So, it was nice to see you.

11:43.996 --> 11:47.415
Really nice of you to stop by.
Really nice.

11:48.195 --> 11:49.326
Nice.

11:49.554 --> 11:52.966
She kept saying the word "nice."
You know what that means, don't you?

11:52.966 --> 11:55.854
- Aw, she thinks you're nice.
- Yeah, exactly-- nice.

11:55.947 --> 11:58.935
As in lacking any edge and/or danger.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.650
Well, you did offer
to fix her a sandwich.

12:01.195 --> 12:03.187
Oh... I know.

12:03.367 --> 12:05.490
It's like the more edgy and
dangerous she became,

12:05.490 --> 12:07.673
the more I became
like a Jewish grandmother.

12:07.773 --> 12:09.754
Not your grandmother.
Keep shucking, Seth.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.586
I want dinner ready by the time
your mother gets home.

12:11.686 --> 12:14.922
Hey, maybe I don't feel
like shucking these, okay?!

12:15.022 --> 12:19.842
Maybe you should go and
shuck 'em yourself, old man.

12:22.918 --> 12:26.847
That's good.
You had me shaking in my boots.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.135
I'm so screwed. Bruce Banner gets mad,
he turns into the Hulk.

12:30.635 --> 12:34.692
I get mad, I turn into, like, a
75-year-old yenta named Sylvia.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.864
Hey, look at all this.
You guys making dinner?

12:40.172 --> 12:42.868
- We wanted to surprise you.
- I have a little surprise myself.

12:42.968 --> 12:47.015
- Look who's joining us.
- Oh!

12:47.115 --> 12:51.486
We were having coffee and we were talking
and then we did a little shopping.

12:51.501 --> 12:52.943
A lot of shopping.

12:53.031 --> 12:55.356
And next thing you know,
it was dinner time.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.868
I hope you guys
don't mind me crashing.

12:56.968 --> 12:58.405
No, no, no. Not at all.

12:58.505 --> 13:01.230
I think dinner with all of us
would be really nice.

13:01.795 --> 13:08.909
- Don't you, Ryan?
- Nice, yeah.

13:10.529 --> 13:13.386
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

13:13.486 --> 13:17.387
Why did you and DJ
cancel on me today?

13:17.683 --> 13:19.331
I was looking forward to meeting him.

13:19.630 --> 13:26.093
It just wasn't a good time. I had a lot
of homework and he was really tired.

13:27.214 --> 13:29.570
You were busy making out with Mom.

13:30.085 --> 13:31.605
What?

13:32.812 --> 13:37.358
- Marissa. That... what?
- Dad, I saw you.

13:39.962 --> 13:46.525
Okay. Look...
I know how it must have looked.

13:46.666 --> 13:50.289
Yeah, it looked a lot like it
used to when you would kiss Mom.

13:50.598 --> 13:52.955
But you know, that was before
she was married to someone else.

13:53.055 --> 13:54.834
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about it. We both wanted...

13:54.934 --> 13:57.142
How could you get back
together with her?

13:57.399 --> 14:01.534
I mean, don't you remember how
she ruined your life and mine?

14:02.926 --> 14:05.317
- Things are different now.
- Oh, really?

14:05.574 --> 14:09.273
So you're not back to lying, cheating,
and sneaking around again?

14:09.590 --> 14:11.442
I thought you were past that.

14:11.606 --> 14:14.138
I thought you were going to take
this new money and start over.

14:14.238 --> 14:15.935
Please, let me, let me, let me explain.

14:16.035 --> 14:18.547
What's there to talk about?
We already know how it ends.

14:18.647 --> 14:22.165
We've already lived through this once.

14:26.887 --> 14:34.291
You know, for once, I wish you would
just grow up and be like a real dad.

14:46.058 --> 14:47.844
What are you doing?

14:48.494 --> 14:50.906
Hey, I just, uh, I needed to borrow
a wife-beater for tonight.

14:51.006 --> 14:52.337
I thought you had several, so...

14:52.437 --> 14:54.054
Yeah, and why are you wearing it?

14:54.154 --> 14:57.530
Well, Alex, she called me nice, Ryan.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.267
So what I'm trying to do is cultivate
more of a, more of a bad boy image.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.559
Yeah, I don't think that's
going to get the job done.

15:03.719 --> 15:06.375
You're right.
I need to borrow your wrist cuff.

15:06.475 --> 15:09.115
Oh, hey, also, remember
that choker you used to wear?

15:09.119 --> 15:13.128
- No. Just, no.
- All right.

15:14.155 --> 15:17.835
You're extra broodish. What's up?
Is that Lindsay thing still bothering you?

15:17.935 --> 15:22.617
Not at all. I mean, we had a really
nice family dinner.

15:22.782 --> 15:26.898
I know, I thought so. Which is part
of the problem, right? Got it.

15:26.998 --> 15:28.561
It shouldn't be a problem.

15:28.662 --> 15:32.881
I mean, Lindsay wants to hang out
with the sister she never knew she had,

15:32.901 --> 15:36.185
I can't stand in the way.
Or make it all about me, right?

15:36.229 --> 15:38.713
No, that's something I would do.

15:39.766 --> 15:42.831
Which is perfect because
you're becoming more like me,

15:42.832 --> 15:46.239
which paves the way for me
to become the brooding bad boy.

15:49.494 --> 15:54.592
- You realize we're both screwed?
- Dude, I'm wearing a wife-beater.

15:58.077 --> 16:02.337
<i>These walls are paper thin
And everyone hears every little sound</i>

16:05.689 --> 16:10.501
<i>Everyone's a voyeurist, they're watching me
Watch them, watch me, right now </i>

16:13.263 --> 16:18.362
<i>They're shakin' hands, they're shakin'
in their shoes Oh, Lord, don't shake me down </i>

16:20.812 --> 16:26.417
<i>Everyone wants two of them
And half of everyone else who's around </i>

16:28.750 --> 16:33.611
<i>Laugh hard,
it's a long ways to the bank</i>

16:36.418 --> 16:39.921
<i>I can't be blamed for nothin' anymore</i>

16:45.040 --> 16:49.047
- What's that?
- What's what? Oh, this?

16:49.568 --> 16:51.105
- This is my good friend, John.
- John?

16:51.205 --> 16:54.330
- Yeah, a good friend of mine.
- Who's John?

16:54.587 --> 16:59.407
No, I said, I said Jim. Or, no,
what I meant to say was Jack.

16:59.507 --> 17:01.818
They're all my friends.

17:07.499 --> 17:10.358
Yeah, that ought to take
the edge off right there.

17:10.458 --> 17:13.215
- Yeah, you guys seem real friendly.
- We're super friendly.

17:13.296 --> 17:15.419
So if you need me, I'm going
to be drinking by the speaker

17:15.532 --> 17:18.316
'cause I don't care
about tinnitus, okay?

17:21.609 --> 17:27.251
Uh, I've got terrible news, really.
I've fallen in love with my ex-wife.

17:27.351 --> 17:29.582
- You were married before Julie?
- You're in love with Julie?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.889
- I don't believe that.
- Oh, unfortunately, I do.

17:31.989 --> 17:34.799
Jimmy, after everything
she did to you before?

17:34.899 --> 17:36.498
I know, that's what Marissa said.

17:36.607 --> 17:41.126
- Marissa knows?
- She caught us.

17:42.903 --> 17:47.918
And the things she said...
well, they're all true.

17:48.623 --> 17:52.451
Look, here's the deal.
I can't be here and be with Julie.

17:52.643 --> 18:01.150
But right now, I can't be here
and... not be with Julie.

18:01.407 --> 18:02.578
What are you saying?

18:04.270 --> 18:08.081
When Hailey left, I felt adrift.

18:08.115 --> 18:10.865
So I made some calls
to see what was out there

18:10.865 --> 18:16.049
and I came across this company
that charters yachts for sale...

18:17.194 --> 18:18.781
...in Maui.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.816
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

18:21.945 --> 18:25.139
I need to get away from here before I do
any more damage to myself

18:25.344 --> 18:29.068
or to my kids... to, to Julie.

18:31.433 --> 18:35.692
I love Newport, but it's,
it's no good for me right now.

18:35.894 --> 18:41.415
In the last year, I've nearly been arrested
and bankrupt for stealing from my clients,

18:41.532 --> 18:44.672
I got punched out at my
daughter's cotillion,

18:44.707 --> 18:47.809
I lost my house, my family,
I tried to kiss you,

18:47.809 --> 18:51.365
which I-I still feel terrible about.

18:51.558 --> 18:56.170
I spent the summer drunk on a boat
with your 25-year-old sister,

18:56.334 --> 18:58.929
and now I'm getting back together
with a woman who,

18:58.929 --> 19:04.835
who started this in the first place.
I can't stay here any longer.

19:04.835 --> 19:06.974
I just can't do it.

19:07.825 --> 19:10.116
So when would you go?

19:10.150 --> 19:12.053
Well, they faxed over a contract
a couple of weeks ago.

19:12.053 --> 19:15.911
All I have to do
is sign it and it's mine.

19:16.467 --> 19:20.050
A couple of days and I'm...
I'm history.

19:29.529 --> 19:33.247
<i>Your gun went off. Well, you shot off
your mouth and look where it got you</i>

19:33.347 --> 19:38.941
<i>My mouth runs on, too
Shouts from both sides</i>

19:38.997 --> 19:42.838
<i>Well, we've got the land. But they've got
the view. Well, now, here's the clue </i>

19:42.838 --> 19:44.696
You're giving me the pinky?

19:44.779 --> 19:48.253
I'm not really into
public displays of affection.

19:49.338 --> 19:53.206
All right, let's go.
Outside, we've got to talk.

19:53.787 --> 19:55.253
So, too bad Coop couldn't make it.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.857
Um, Zach, only I can call her Coop.
It's kind of weird when you say it.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.295
Got it.
Too bad Marissa couldn't make it.

20:01.395 --> 20:04.849
I'd be freaking out, too if my mom and dad
were getting back together, and, like,

20:04.849 --> 20:07.199
kept this huge secret from me.

20:07.484 --> 20:10.799
Yeah, so, uh, we haven't had a chance
to talk about our winter breaks yet.

20:10.899 --> 20:14.053
- I know.
- Hey! Modest Mouse!

20:14.472 --> 20:17.398
Hey, volume, Cohen. It's not Metallica.

20:17.498 --> 20:21.669
No, it's not Metallica!
It's Modest Mouse!

20:22.434 --> 20:27.976
Ew! You're like so sweaty.
Come here. Wait.

20:28.592 --> 20:31.448
Your breath smells like Marissa!
You are so drunk!

20:31.548 --> 20:33.605
So, hey, you guys
are hanging out. That's cool.

20:33.705 --> 20:35.824
I guess she was cool with it, right?

20:36.948 --> 20:38.607
Cool with what?

20:39.499 --> 20:43.365
- Thanks, Seth.
- You're welcome.    Welcome.

20:43.946 --> 20:48.624
Hey...
is the stage revolving or are we?

20:52.154 --> 20:53.965
They're really good. What's the matter?

20:54.065 --> 20:57.837
You know what? You're the matter.
I mean, you've been weird all night.

20:58.072 --> 21:00.475
You've been weird pretty much
since I showed up for dinner,

21:00.575 --> 21:03.528
which, by the way,
was weird for me, too.

21:03.728 --> 21:05.467
Well, what happened to Switzerland?

21:05.760 --> 21:09.438
Uh, Kirsten wanted to hang out
and she's really cool.

21:09.538 --> 21:12.476
She is. And if you want to hang out
with her, you should.

21:12.554 --> 21:19.065
But if the Cohens are really my family,
then you are my family.

21:19.265 --> 21:24.859
Which means kissing me is like
kissing your sister or step-aunt.

21:24.959 --> 21:28.077
Ryan! You have to take
Seth home, right now.

21:28.177 --> 21:31.702
He is wasted and leaving a path
of destruction in his wake.

21:31.704 --> 21:36.427
I cannot believe you.
And I cannot believe that you told Cohen.

21:36.718 --> 21:37.571
See?

21:37.584 --> 21:43.126
And he puked all over the merchandise
table, which I now have to go and mop up.

21:46.374 --> 21:48.368
Ah! I know who lives here!

21:48.575 --> 21:50.577
This is the Cohen residence
in the heezy.

21:50.653 --> 21:52.127
Okay, okay, we've got
to be really stealth here.

21:52.227 --> 21:58.237
Hey, I was all-camp, Capture The Flag,
Camp Tacaho, I invented the stealth.

21:58.306 --> 21:59.698
- That's right, you did.
- I sure did!

21:59.798 --> 22:01.361
But you're yelling.
You need to be quiet.

22:01.361 --> 22:06.019
I haven't been this wasted since your first
night in Newport, when we beat up those kids.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.023
With a little bit of that...
and a little bit of that.

22:09.044 --> 22:10.431
- You need the seat belt.
- Little bit of that...

22:10.466 --> 22:13.006
You need your seat belt.

22:15.829 --> 22:19.714
What's going on? You guys okay?
Seth?

22:20.163 --> 22:26.416
Shh... We're being stealth.
Shh.

22:29.411 --> 22:33.475
Look, everything you said
yesterday, you were right.

22:33.784 --> 22:36.943
I'm making the same mistakes
all over again with your mom.

22:37.319 --> 22:41.009
- So you're going to end it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

22:41.243 --> 22:42.543
Well, that's great, Dad.

22:42.643 --> 22:46.185
But, it's, uh, it's... it's
more complicated than that.

22:46.420 --> 22:54.796
I, um, I need to get some perspective on
the world, or... or something. You're right.

22:54.796 --> 22:58.350
I need to learn
how to be a real dad.

22:58.562 --> 23:05.523
- So, I'm, uh, leaving.
- What?

23:05.824 --> 23:08.874
Yeah, I'm moving to Maui.

23:13.806 --> 23:18.177
That's your idea of being a real dad?
Abandoning me and moving to Hawaii?

23:18.340 --> 23:23.357
It's not forever.
It's only for six months, maybe.

23:24.429 --> 23:28.114
You can come and visit anytime you want.

23:34.013 --> 23:39.069
Well, good luck with that.
I mean, I hear Maui's beautiful.

23:41.989 --> 23:47.059
Uh, you know, there's going to be a
good-bye party, tonight at the Cohens'.

23:49.156 --> 23:52.896
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Totally.

23:54.381 --> 23:56.528
I mean, you were the last thing
keeping me sane,

23:56.556 --> 23:59.511
so when you leave it should be
interesting to see how things go.

23:59.971 --> 24:02.822
But, uh, I'll see you tonight.

24:11.434 --> 24:18.511
Hello. I just came by to tell you I'm
dying and thank you for your friendship.

24:19.618 --> 24:22.602
Oh... slowly, slowly.

24:22.702 --> 24:26.307
Oh, and also to apologize
for whatever happened last night.

24:26.451 --> 24:28.685
You don't have to apologize to me.

24:28.733 --> 24:32.577
- Have you talked to Zach?
- No, why?

24:32.717 --> 24:35.762
Ah, you kind of destroyed
his relationship with Summer.

24:37.245 --> 24:41.521
- Oh, I violated the code of man.
- Mmm. Talked to Alex?

24:41.829 --> 24:43.659
She won't answer my calls.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.259
Hmm. Might have something
to do with all the vomit.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.235
All the vomit? How much vomit?

24:47.462 --> 24:50.683
Like the little girl in Sixth Sense
or the fat guy in Monty Python?

24:50.783 --> 24:54.357
Well, you wanted to be a bad boy.
You did bad.

24:54.633 --> 24:57.881
Yeah, but not in a good way.
I've got to talk to Alex.

24:57.981 --> 25:00.788
I'm sure I can be a good bad boy,
not a bad bad boy.

25:00.888 --> 25:09.331
- Mm-hmm. Good luck with that. Aspirin?
- Thank you.

25:10.406 --> 25:15.080
You have lobster rolls, right?
He loves lobster rolls.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.191
Oh, if it isn't my son, the wine-oh

25:18.283 --> 25:19.231
You guys found out?

25:19.231 --> 25:23.769
- You weren't exactly stealth.
- Damn. I lost a step since Tahoe.

25:23.877 --> 25:27.823
Your dad's been waiting for you to leave
the room, so he can send you back to it.

25:29.027 --> 25:33.853
That's great. Um, I know I should probably
be used to this at this point, but uh,

25:33.937 --> 25:35.142
are we having a party?

25:35.281 --> 25:37.398
It's Jimmy Cooper's going away party.

25:37.530 --> 25:41.099
Oh, okay, wow. Great. Then I'm going
to run a quick errand real fast

25:41.099 --> 25:42.000
and then I'm going to come straight home.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.460
- You're not going anywhere.
- Dad, I'm grounded.

25:44.470 --> 25:46.858
I get it, I deserve it, okay?

25:46.958 --> 25:48.192
Even though this headache is just

25:48.192 --> 25:49.915
far worse than any punishment
that you could administer...

25:49.915 --> 25:51.128
No.

25:51.262 --> 25:54.911
I need to go see a girl very fast,
and then I will come straight home.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.016
Now, which girl is this?
The one who thinks you're too nice?

25:57.241 --> 25:59.965
The one you're trying to impress
by drinking a fifth of Jack?

26:00.346 --> 26:04.287
I think his name was John, but yes,
and Dad, it went horribly, okay?

26:04.287 --> 26:06.804
So I just need to talk to her really fast and
I need to, you know, sort of, you know...

26:06.804 --> 26:08.314
Go upstairs and get dressed.

26:08.829 --> 26:12.634
You know what, maybe if I'm grounded,
I shouldn't go to this party.

26:14.862 --> 26:18.539
I'm going to go get dressed.
Stairs.

26:24.927 --> 26:27.538
Hi. I got you something.

26:28.526 --> 26:31.155
It's the novelization of
The Valley, Season One.

26:31.407 --> 26:34.341
I have the hard cover signed by
Gertie Bridges. I should go.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.147
No, that's why I'm here.
I wanted to give you a ride.

26:36.247 --> 26:39.024
- Actually, I'm going to go alone.
- You're going by yourself?

26:39.066 --> 26:40.249
Han Solo. Okay?

26:40.249 --> 26:43.688
But if I change my mind, I'll have
Cohen get drunk and let you know, okay?

26:43.688 --> 26:47.202
- Summer, come on.
- Hooking up with your tutor, Zach?

26:47.462 --> 26:49.291
Not even that cool in the '80's.

26:49.479 --> 26:53.763
I mean, she could have at least been a
hooker and helped you get into Princeton.

26:55.337 --> 26:59.970
<i>Come around in this fine town where
their freedom makes the world go around</i>

27:00.088 --> 27:02.490
<i>Where dreams are found...</i>

27:03.592 --> 27:07.938
- Hey, Julie.
- Hey, uh, Kirsten.

27:08.230 --> 27:11.039
Sad day, thinking about
Jimmy Cooper, huh?

27:11.321 --> 27:13.563
Why, I remember when he was a boy,
taking him out in the boat,

27:13.659 --> 27:19.275
inviting him over...
for dinner.

27:23.987 --> 27:24.990
Listen, I'll see you in a few.

27:25.057 --> 27:27.710
I'm gonna slip out for a while.
I'm trying to fix things with Alex.

27:27.849 --> 27:29.741
- What about your parents?
- They're scary.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.519
Which is why I need you
to cover for me, okay?

27:32.519 --> 27:35.499
Just throw up the smoke screen, give them
some of that Ryan Atwood double talk.

27:35.599 --> 27:37.278
I barely talk.

27:37.372 --> 27:38.818
Good point. The less said, the better.

27:38.918 --> 27:41.070
I-I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

27:41.818 --> 27:44.374
You call yourself a bad boy.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.885
Jimbo.

27:53.617 --> 27:55.705
I'm sorry we couldn't get a
better turnout for you.

27:55.805 --> 28:00.836
Well, considering I defrauded most of my
closest friends... it's not bad.

28:02.448 --> 28:06.980
- I'm going to miss you, Jimmy.
- Ah, well. Thanks, Sandy.

28:08.057 --> 28:12.562
- How'd she take the news?
- I haven't talked to her yet.

28:14.541 --> 28:17.368
Good luck with that.
Hi, Julie.

28:20.571 --> 28:22.335
Were you just going
to send me a postcard?

28:22.883 --> 28:24.125
I wouldn't have known you were leaving

28:24.125 --> 28:28.026
if Kirsten hadn't invited me
to your going away party.

28:28.163 --> 28:29.602
Of course I was
going to tell you.

28:29.702 --> 28:34.853
Can we, can we talk about this someplace
a little bit more private, please?

28:43.315 --> 28:44.727
Look who stopped by.

28:47.567 --> 28:52.328
I'm going to go grab some champagne.
You two have fun.

28:52.926 --> 28:55.393
Now we're waving at each other.

28:55.487 --> 28:57.486
I thought you agreed Kirsten
can't find out about us, right?

28:57.586 --> 28:59.574
Right, because then it might be weird.

28:59.674 --> 29:03.867
Ryan, have you seen...
Lindsay, hello.

29:07.846 --> 29:12.658
Excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'll find Julie myself.

29:13.071 --> 29:15.294
Good to see you.

29:17.644 --> 29:19.255
Bye, Dad.

29:19.596 --> 29:22.228
Yeah, this isn't going
to be weird at all.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.252
Did you really think
that this was going somewhere?

29:25.373 --> 29:28.669
I don't know, Jimmy. I was under the
impression that this meant something.

29:28.769 --> 29:33.592
Well, it did.
It... does.

29:34.084 --> 29:37.216
But did you really
think it was going to last?

29:37.355 --> 29:39.654
You really think that
I would leave you again?

29:39.729 --> 29:45.869
Well, history isn't exactly working
in your favor on that one.

29:46.793 --> 29:49.974
Plus, you deserve
to be happy with Caleb.

29:50.074 --> 29:55.664
Oh, yeah, that's a storybook romance with our
illegitimate children and our tapped phone lines.

29:55.793 --> 29:58.589
At least it's real.

30:08.428 --> 30:13.046
Jules.
Jules.

30:26.057 --> 30:28.542
You've got to go so soon?

30:28.721 --> 30:33.730
I think it's probably best I go before
anyone knows why I'm going.

30:36.498 --> 30:39.352
Oh, I... I'm s-sorry.
I didn't mean to...

30:39.352 --> 30:44.932
It's fine.
We're just saying our good-byes.

30:50.983 --> 30:56.182
- See you, James.
- So long, Jules.

31:08.291 --> 31:10.125
Hey! People I know.

31:10.206 --> 31:13.399
- Yeah. Where's Zach?
- He couldn't make it.

31:13.530 --> 31:16.009
- Where's Cohen?
- Oh, he's hurting from last night.

31:16.109 --> 31:18.405
Well, I'd like to hurt
him for last night.

31:22.753 --> 31:24.717
Kind of a boring party.

31:28.609 --> 31:30.363
Not for long.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.159
I'm fine.

31:39.082 --> 31:41.673
Well, if it isn't the wicked witch
of the west coast.

31:43.372 --> 31:48.811
Are you drunk?
Let me guess: tequila?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.261
She was like this
when I picked her up.

31:50.361 --> 31:52.016
You don't have to defend
yourself to her.

31:52.016 --> 31:53.764
No, but you do, young lady.

31:53.833 --> 31:56.724
Come on, let's go, DJ, before
she tries to sleep with you next.

31:56.772 --> 32:00.941
- What did you say?
- You heard me, you whore.

32:03.946 --> 32:07.962
- Hey, guys, guys, not here.
- No, let's do it here. Okay?

32:10.854 --> 32:13.369
You know what? Let's tell everyone
why you're leaving, Dad.

32:13.787 --> 32:16.619
Why don't you tell everyone
why you're leaving.

32:17.171 --> 32:21.482
Huh?
Hello, everybody.

32:21.575 --> 32:23.743
- Let's go, Marissa, you're drunk.
- Get off of me.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.774
Guys, hey, guys. Come on.
Come on.

32:27.874 --> 32:29.946
Do you see what you're leaving me with?
You see how screwed up she is?

32:30.046 --> 32:34.911
Of course I'm screwed up.
I'm the daughter of a thief and a slut.

32:35.756 --> 32:42.647
You know what, I just...
I just hate you both so much.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.932
You wanted a good
old-fashioned O.C. party.

32:56.032 --> 32:59.117
I just hope she's okay,
and that she calls.

32:59.849 --> 33:03.061
As bad as I thought she'd take it,
that was worse.

33:04.021 --> 33:07.470
Well, it's going to be hard for her.
For all of us.

33:08.459 --> 33:13.193
I was hoping that while I'm gone, you'd
go over to the house and check up on her.

33:13.473 --> 33:16.615
- My father lives in that house, Jimmy.
- I know.

33:16.743 --> 33:18.531
That's why I want you to go there.

33:20.088 --> 33:23.531
I need to know that someone
is watching over her.

33:25.136 --> 33:29.547
For my oldest friend, anything.

33:51.245 --> 33:56.537
I can't believe this. If we had gotten
married, I'd be moving to Hawaii.

33:57.494 --> 34:04.118
No, if I'd married you,
there's no way I would have left.

34:10.804 --> 34:13.022
I just want to get
the hell out of here.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.466
Where'd they park my car, Irvine?

34:16.126 --> 34:21.303
Excuse me, Mr. Nichol.
Uh, there's a problem with your car.

34:21.507 --> 34:26.293
- You scratched my Aston Martin?
- Your car's been stolen.

34:26.493 --> 34:31.329
- Wow, who's car is that?
- This? It's mine, Alex.

34:31.429 --> 34:35.607
- I stole it.
- You stole a car?

34:35.755 --> 34:40.088
Yep. I do that sometimes, Alex.
I do it for kicks.

34:40.228 --> 34:41.828
Are you trying
to impress me or something?

34:41.928 --> 34:42.395
What?

34:42.395 --> 34:48.855
You know, with getting drunk
and stealing cars, and... It's just...

34:49.027 --> 34:58.809
Seth, I've been with a lot of bad boys
and you are not one of them.

34:59.925 --> 35:06.249
Right. Well, I'm just gonna make a Bundt
cake and put on some tea. See you later.

35:06.249 --> 35:12.721
No, Seth, you're a good guy.
And that's why I like you.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.422
Really?

35:16.427 --> 35:20.262
Well, that's good, because I don't think this
whole bad boy thing is really working out for me.

35:22.859 --> 35:23.878
Me neither.

35:23.978 --> 35:27.143
Is this your vehicle, sir?

35:31.776 --> 35:33.397
What are you still doing here?

35:34.318 --> 35:38.256
Uh, your stepmom blocked my car in.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.889
I tried to wake her up, but is she,
like, alive?

35:40.889 --> 35:43.005
Yeah, just heavily medicated.

35:43.906 --> 35:45.799
- Uh, how was the party?
- I don't know.

35:45.850 --> 35:49.721
Maybe I should hire you a tutor
and she can catch you up on everything.

35:52.184 --> 35:57.911
Look... I've had a lot of time to sit here,
vibrating at a very high frequency and think.

35:58.011 --> 36:03.219
And I realize this is a really
important moment for us.

36:03.496 --> 36:06.573
This is our first fight
that wasn't about Cohen.

36:06.913 --> 36:09.845
I mean, he helped, but this fight,
it's ours.

36:09.945 --> 36:13.905
- I guess that's true.
- I'm really sorry.

36:14.158 --> 36:17.743
- It didn't mean anything, believe me.
- It's not about what happened, Zach.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.854
It's just that you didn't tell me,
you told Cohen.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.888
From now on,
I'll tell you everything.

36:24.088 --> 36:26.847
Why, planning on screwing up again?

36:27.391 --> 36:30.625
Only one way to find out.

36:37.304 --> 36:39.123
We finally have a moment alone.

36:39.467 --> 36:43.874
Yeah, maybe a chance
to talk about everything.

36:44.698 --> 36:47.628
You know what? I don't want to.

36:48.761 --> 36:53.612
I mean, we keep hypothesizing how kissing
me might be like kissing your sister,

36:53.688 --> 36:58.154
and I think we should just find out.

37:00.235 --> 37:03.507
So you want me to kiss you
as an experiment?

37:05.522 --> 37:12.113
Yeah. And if it truly is weird,
well, then that's our answer.

37:12.213 --> 37:13.612
Okay.

37:14.211 --> 37:16.859
- No, uh, pressure.
- Right.

37:17.828 --> 37:25.501
<i>She's everything Everything
I'm already somebody's baby</i>

37:27.792 --> 37:32.093
<i>You don't deserve to feel for me</i>

37:34.817 --> 37:37.020
Oh, hey, guys. I was wondering
if you've seen Seth.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.683
No.

37:38.713 --> 37:41.123
We were just looking for him ourselves.

37:41.146 --> 37:43.164
Okay, thanks.

37:45.951 --> 37:46.947
That was close

37:47.047 --> 37:50.690
Yeah, maybe we should just...
keep this to ourselves for now.

37:50.949 --> 37:55.922
At least until we find out
if we're breaking any laws.

38:00.947 --> 38:03.726
Hey, Dad. How was the party?

38:05.331 --> 38:07.253
I think somebody called the cops.

38:29.682 --> 38:34.161
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

38:34.549 --> 38:40.862
- I called him.
- Thanks, DJ. Appreciate it.

38:45.050 --> 38:47.418
You mind if I join you?

38:58.557 --> 39:01.309
I never thought I'd leave this place.

39:01.726 --> 39:07.022
I guess life doesn't always turn out
the way you think it will, huh?

39:10.686 --> 39:13.792
I'll take that as a pensive "no."

39:17.452 --> 39:28.015
I'm sorry, Marissa. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry
I let you down. I'm sorry that I...

39:28.578 --> 39:37.350
I couldn't... give you the life that...
that you deserve.

39:40.587 --> 39:47.014
Although I nearly went to jail trying.
You've got to give a guy credit for that.

39:48.248 --> 39:52.100
- Sweetheart.
- Don't go.

39:52.401 --> 39:57.804
Please, don't go. Don't leave me.

40:03.016 --> 40:07.563
I got to go.
I got to... I got to get a life.

40:08.813 --> 40:12.114
I know, I know. It stinks.
But...

40:15.474 --> 40:21.754
But, listen, anytime you want to come live
with me, you just let me know, okay?

40:22.158 --> 40:26.162
And I will send a boat or a plane,
whatever, okay?

40:40.267 --> 40:45.834
It's getting... it's getting kind of cold.
I think we should head back, huh?

40:45.910 --> 40:48.319
- Want to get out of here?
- Wait.

40:49.475 --> 40:54.406
Can we just...
Can we just sit here for a while?

40:57.122 --> 41:03.373
Sure, kiddo. Here, put this on.
You must be freezing.

41:08.260 --> 41:12.981
I'll sit with you all night.

41:25.284 --> 41:31.307
<i>Ice-age heat wave, can't complain if the
world's at large, why should I remain?</i>

41:31.442 --> 41:37.606
<i>Walked away to another plan Gonna find
another place, maybe one I can stand</i>

41:37.606 --> 41:42.004
<i>I move on to another day
To a whole new town... </i>

41:44.545 --> 41:46.239
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:46.239 --> 41:49.733
I was just, uh, seeing my dad off.

41:50.753 --> 41:54.565
- He left this morning.
- I'm sorry.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.679
I brought bagels.

41:56.779 --> 42:02.111
Well, that's the secret password
into the Cohen house. Come on in.

42:06.977 --> 42:09.285
Marissa brought bagels.

42:10.609 --> 42:13.096
Thank God. These ones are stale.

42:13.411 --> 42:14.787
Yeah, I almost chipped a tooth.

42:14.887 --> 42:18.635
Gather around, Marissa,
I'm going to teach you how to schmear.

42:18.833 --> 42:21.451
- He is an artist with cream cheese.
- Well, thank you, honey.

42:21.507 --> 42:23.407
- Slicer.
- Slicer.

42:27.154 --> 42:29.294
- Cream cheese.
- Cream cheese.

42:35.703 --> 42:39.430
- So, you going to be okay?
- Of course. We got bagels.

42:39.530 --> 42:41.514
Ah, yes, bagels.

42:41.590 --> 42:44.738
Now, Marissa, this is perhaps
the most important part.

42:44.910 --> 42:51.273
Without using excess cream cheese...
There's not an ounce, a drop...
