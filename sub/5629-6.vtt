00:17.024 --> 00:18.224
What?

00:18.541 --> 00:20.258
So, have you made up your mind?

00:20.698 --> 00:23.831
I just don't know why we need to
be making plans the whole time.

00:23.846 --> 00:26.677
Because we're only staying
here for a week. That's why.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.016
Come on,

00:28.047 --> 00:30.553
would you rather go to the Blue Cave

00:30.599 --> 00:32.930
or go snorkelling in Stiniva?

00:34.052 --> 00:35.252
None?

00:37.275 --> 00:40.200
Honey, I'm joking...

00:40.882 --> 00:42.082
Honey...

00:56.909 --> 00:58.340
Wait here, okay?

01:01.899 --> 01:04.203
Please. Step aside, please, I'm a doctor.

01:06.903 --> 01:08.103
Hello.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.616
Adelio?

01:12.543 --> 01:14.106
Hand me your apron.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.586
- What happened to him?
- I don't know yet.

01:19.939 --> 01:22.321
Call an ambulance. An ambulance.

01:29.547 --> 01:30.823
Deep cut to the abdomen,

01:30.824 --> 01:33.081
massive blood loss, high
temperature, shallow breathing.

01:33.082 --> 01:35.588
Pulse is at 35. Could be septicaemia, OK?

01:35.589 --> 01:36.914
I'll come with you.

01:37.429 --> 01:39.649
- Where are you going?
- I have to go with him.

01:39.769 --> 01:40.969
You stay here.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.170
I love you.

01:50.969 --> 01:53.407
Where are you?

01:58.004 --> 01:59.971
Adelio, I'm freaking out.

02:00.091 --> 02:01.529
Where are you?

02:02.382 --> 02:03.707
Call me.

02:06.664 --> 02:08.124
Anything else?

02:08.553 --> 02:10.293
Where can I get a taxi?

02:22.870 --> 02:24.741
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

02:24.768 --> 02:27.083
I'm looking for my husband, Doctor Fuentes.

02:27.117 --> 02:28.954
There's no doctor here by that name.

02:28.969 --> 02:30.777
No, he doesn't work here,

02:30.882 --> 02:32.969
he came here with an injured man.

02:33.155 --> 02:34.960
In an ambulance, an hour ago.

02:34.977 --> 02:37.860
I'm sorry, but we've had no
ambulance admission this morning.

02:38.762 --> 02:42.087
Is... is there any other hospital
they would have taken him to?

02:42.590 --> 02:44.603
Not on this island.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.611
That's impossible.

02:48.026 --> 02:49.240
Um...

02:49.488 --> 02:52.707
can you just check again, please?

02:57.947 --> 02:59.265
See for yourself.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.995
- _
- No ambulance since last night.

03:03.754 --> 03:05.095
Now excuse me.

03:11.918 --> 03:14.124
_

03:14.688 --> 03:18.170
Hello, this is Doctor Adelio
Fuentes, please leave a message.

03:25.781 --> 03:29.200
_

03:29.232 --> 03:31.324
Is anybody in there?

03:31.899 --> 03:33.816
Somebody please.

03:34.079 --> 03:35.679
I need help.

03:36.906 --> 03:38.535
Señora Fuentes?

03:40.881 --> 03:44.052
If you wanna see your husband,
you have to come with me.

04:18.724 --> 04:20.426
I don't understand.

04:20.889 --> 04:24.084
What does the International
Criminal Court have to do with this?

04:24.108 --> 04:26.677
I know you have a lot of
questions but before I answer,

04:26.678 --> 04:29.431
- I need you to agree to something.
- What?

04:29.433 --> 04:32.651
You'll need to surrender your phone, and
stay under guard for the next 24 hours.

04:32.656 --> 04:34.896
- Why?
- Do I have your consent?

04:36.761 --> 04:38.002
Yes.

04:38.717 --> 04:42.136
- But I need some answers.
- As soon as we get there. OK?

05:01.216 --> 05:04.413
The man your husband treated
died on the way to the hospital.

05:04.426 --> 05:07.231
- He was badly injured.
- He was, but he was also sick.

05:07.351 --> 05:10.258
We believe he contracted
a virus known as CLV.

05:10.259 --> 05:13.461
- What virus?
- CLV, Charilongona Virus.

05:13.474 --> 05:16.310
It's a haemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola.

05:16.311 --> 05:19.365
Transferred by direct
contact to bodily fluids.

05:20.802 --> 05:22.259
Adelio, he...

05:23.773 --> 05:25.716
he touched that man's blood.

05:26.022 --> 05:27.805
He was covered in it.

05:28.252 --> 05:29.919
We're on our honeymoon.

05:29.965 --> 05:31.907
Your husband is in quarantine right now.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.888
- He's infected?
- We don't know that yet.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.427
Please.

05:35.657 --> 05:37.505
We also quarantined the ambulance crew,

05:37.526 --> 05:39.325
and picked up the vendors from the market.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.868
We have to take every precaution.

05:40.988 --> 05:42.396
Is there a cure?

05:42.595 --> 05:44.721
There is an experimental anti-viral drug

05:44.741 --> 05:46.203
on the way here from Canada,

05:46.218 --> 05:47.925
but we don't know how effective it is,

05:47.941 --> 05:51.003
- and the supply is extremely limited.
- But what if it doesn't work?

05:51.123 --> 05:52.833
What if it doesn't get here in time?

05:52.848 --> 05:54.785
It's what we have to work with, OK?

05:56.963 --> 05:59.640
Please. Right now, there is no
danger for the general public.

05:59.641 --> 06:02.770
And that's why I must ask you
not to speak about this to anyone.

06:03.101 --> 06:06.765
A panic would only generate a crisis
on top of a crisis, you do understand?

06:07.032 --> 06:08.377
I understand.

06:21.379 --> 06:22.584
You OK?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.886
Are all these people infected?

06:25.902 --> 06:28.744
No, these are people who
may have been exposed.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.524
Just being held for observation.

06:40.402 --> 06:42.334
You're gonna be able to see

06:42.349 --> 06:43.729
and talk to each other,

06:43.744 --> 06:45.817
- but not touch, OK?
- OK.

06:52.969 --> 06:54.172
Adelio?

07:02.309 --> 07:03.663
Hey, sweetie.

07:06.735 --> 07:07.940
Hey,

07:08.892 --> 07:11.463
here at least I won't have
to go snorkelling, right?

07:17.410 --> 07:18.765
Don't worry.

07:20.353 --> 07:22.203
_

07:22.227 --> 07:26.604
We've identified the man who was
bleeding outside the café as Ivan Amanti.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.597
We think he is patient zero.

07:28.627 --> 07:31.038
He was working for someone named Kasun.

07:31.039 --> 07:33.108
Kasun Agosta.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.441
- Part of the Maussan Clan.
- You've heard of him?

07:36.467 --> 07:39.502
He's one of the Bastards of Belgrade.

07:40.241 --> 07:41.777
They have moved

07:41.847 --> 07:45.499
thousands upon thousands of
kilos of heroin through Europe,

07:45.557 --> 07:47.084
ever since the war ended.

07:47.106 --> 07:50.013
I asked Luke to look into
the Maussan ties in Corfu.

07:50.033 --> 07:53.084
- And the rest of the team?
- Already on the ground in Croatia.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.202
They're searching for whoever
stabbed Ivan Amanti outside the café.

07:56.234 --> 07:57.691
Whoever he is,

07:57.729 --> 08:00.252
one, he will not know he is infected,

08:00.291 --> 08:03.473
and two, he will not want to be found.

08:05.621 --> 08:06.848
Mr. Dorn.

08:07.071 --> 08:10.297
Ah, Inspector Costante, Doctor Hoff.

08:10.309 --> 08:12.713
From the Institute of
Infectious Diseases in Bern.

08:12.714 --> 08:13.914
Pleasure.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.018
Please, follow me this way.

08:18.212 --> 08:21.066
Shaking hands is a polite tradition,
but it makes the task of containing

08:21.067 --> 08:23.044
viral transmission
infinitely more difficult.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.339
Civility could quite literally
be the death of us all.

08:26.397 --> 08:28.250
I see you've been busy, Inspector.

08:28.269 --> 08:30.064
So far, none of them are symptomatic,

08:30.065 --> 08:32.383
but as you suggested, we isolated anyone

08:32.384 --> 08:35.226
who could possibly have been in
contact with our murder victim.

08:35.239 --> 08:36.811
What can you tell us about the victim?

08:36.823 --> 08:39.524
Ivan Amanti was stabbed
some time before dawn.

08:39.535 --> 08:42.677
The coroner says the murder weapon
was some kind of a curved blade.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.207
With all the fluids coming
out of the stomach wound,

08:45.271 --> 08:47.903
if our assailant were in
contact with any one of them...

08:47.916 --> 08:50.389
Then I'm afraid he was
undoubtedly exposed to CLV.

08:51.002 --> 08:52.308
And this is him.

08:52.610 --> 08:53.959
Ivan Amanti.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.753
We catch our assailant,

08:56.055 --> 08:58.126
- we contain the virus.
- You must.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.357
Because this is what CLV does.

09:00.383 --> 09:01.883
It ravages.

09:02.487 --> 09:04.768
Like its older sisters, Ebola and Marburg

09:04.769 --> 09:07.440
it has a fatality rate of 88%.

09:07.511 --> 09:11.163
How long before we can assume that
our assailant will be contagious?

09:11.182 --> 09:13.719
The virus is not contagious
until you become symptomatic,

09:13.725 --> 09:15.188
but it moves fast.

09:15.226 --> 09:17.718
Symptoms fever, cough, rash

09:17.731 --> 09:20.381
occur between 6 to 14 hours after exposure.

09:20.388 --> 09:23.494
Can the coroner be any more specific
as to when the wound occurred?

09:23.495 --> 09:25.776
Molly says clotting and
inflammation around the wound

09:25.777 --> 09:28.797
suggests it was 3 to
10 hours prior to death.

09:28.816 --> 09:31.257
Those 7 hours make a world of difference.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.405
Right now, the host is walking
around unaware that he's undergoing a

09:34.406 --> 09:36.904
profound metamorphosis at a cellular level.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.767
_

09:56.671 --> 09:57.929
- Anything?
- All of Europe

09:57.930 --> 09:59.489
is covered by surveillance cameras

09:59.490 --> 10:00.966
with the exception of this island.

10:00.986 --> 10:03.898
Well, I guess you don't need
security cameras in paradise.

10:06.808 --> 10:08.310
Morning, sunshine.

10:08.345 --> 10:10.016
- Morning.
- It's Luke.

10:10.136 --> 10:12.078
- Where are you?
- Corfu.

10:12.569 --> 10:14.683
Just leaving the house
where Amanti was holed up

10:14.684 --> 10:16.154
with his late partner in crime.

10:16.155 --> 10:17.412
- Got anything?
- Yeah, I'm

10:17.413 --> 10:19.886
sending you the names
of the neighbours, but...

10:20.026 --> 10:22.666
it's like I told Carine, no one came near.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.462
Great news. You're heading our way?

10:24.472 --> 10:25.672
Uh-uh.

10:26.267 --> 10:27.601
Can't wait.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.906
He really doesn't like me, does he?

10:32.054 --> 10:33.339
I like you.

10:34.373 --> 10:35.573
So does she.

10:35.850 --> 10:38.079
Can you guys come to the
other side of the dock?

10:39.404 --> 10:43.056
There was a faint trail of blood
from the market which led us here.

10:43.095 --> 10:45.878
Well, that Spanish couple said
the man came from this direction.

10:45.907 --> 10:48.201
Yeah. There's more blood
on the side of the boat,

10:48.211 --> 10:49.842
and the other side of the dock.

10:52.941 --> 10:54.928
Smears down the hull...

10:55.240 --> 10:57.731
Looks like Amanti was
holding on to the side.

10:58.565 --> 11:00.849
So, Amanti gets stabbed in the deck,

11:00.869 --> 11:02.564
gets back into the boat,

11:03.018 --> 11:04.506
falls into the water,

11:04.576 --> 11:06.894
climbs out and then
staggers through the market.

11:06.909 --> 11:10.073
Post-mortem revealed the stabbing
could have occurred anywhere between

11:10.074 --> 11:13.098
- 10 pm and 5 am.
- Did you find any witnesses?

11:13.103 --> 11:15.911
Anyone hanging out on the beach
in the middle of the night?

11:15.915 --> 11:19.549
Well, local constabulary have been
canvassing the area all morning, but,

11:19.554 --> 11:21.165
nothing as yet.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.946
_

11:28.316 --> 11:29.516
Hey.

11:30.347 --> 11:31.547
Michel.

11:33.571 --> 11:36.276
The CDC is handling medical protocol.

11:36.607 --> 11:38.702
They have an epidemiologist on site

11:38.703 --> 11:40.823
- who's consulting with ***.
- Good.

11:40.824 --> 11:43.102
I can't help but worry
about the safety of our team.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.323
Well, they've been brought up-to-date
on all the latest safety procedures.

11:46.324 --> 11:48.501
- Yes.
- There's nothing more you can do.

11:48.515 --> 11:50.561
I've kept the local police out of the loop.

11:50.562 --> 11:52.362
They think it's just
a murder investigation.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.563
Good.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.159
Last thing we want is for this to

11:56.502 --> 12:00.038
be leaked to the media, and have
some broadcaster create a panic.

12:00.039 --> 12:01.918
CLV is a dramatic beast.

12:01.919 --> 12:03.194
You haemorrhage,

12:03.933 --> 12:05.992
blood comes pouring out of your eyes,

12:06.321 --> 12:07.814
out of your pores,

12:08.511 --> 12:10.429
and then very quickly, you die.

12:10.488 --> 12:13.147
What did the press say?
If it bleeds, it leads.

12:20.144 --> 12:22.112
You're all making yourself at home?

12:22.425 --> 12:24.011
Best Wi-Fi on the island.

12:24.016 --> 12:27.066
So long as I keep buying
espressos, they don't seem to mind.

12:27.089 --> 12:28.571
OK, show me what you found.

12:28.691 --> 12:31.363
Well, there's no CCTV
on the island, but, the

12:31.364 --> 12:35.150
tourism office has a web-cam
pointed at the harbour 24/7.

12:35.748 --> 12:37.592
Even with infra-red for night viewing.

12:38.663 --> 12:39.865
Here we go.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.114
3:48 am,

12:42.124 --> 12:44.551
A man with bag arrives on the dock.

12:46.217 --> 12:48.159
Paces for 22 minutes.

12:50.093 --> 12:52.003
4:06 am,

12:52.005 --> 12:54.674
Ivan Amanti arrives in the powerboat.

12:54.693 --> 12:56.485
He can barely stand on his feet.

12:56.498 --> 12:58.220
Well, either he doesn't have sea-legs,

12:58.230 --> 13:00.804
or he's already feeling the CLV symptoms.

13:01.928 --> 13:04.142
They talk for a minute.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.180
Amanti tries to grab the bag.

13:07.962 --> 13:09.612
Then there's a struggle.

13:09.994 --> 13:12.410
Then Amanti climbs back into the boat,

13:12.608 --> 13:15.827
for something, and we can't
figure out what's in his hand.

13:15.888 --> 13:18.101
A rod, or stick?

13:18.984 --> 13:21.003
Can't sharpen the image any more.

13:22.283 --> 13:25.425
OK, so, 4:08 am, Amanti attacks with

13:25.433 --> 13:27.488
that stick and then in
the middle of the struggle

13:27.489 --> 13:28.872
he gets wounded himself.

13:28.873 --> 13:30.663
Then our bad man runs off.

13:30.664 --> 13:32.763
He's almost definitely infected.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.191
Amanti gets back on the boat.

13:35.311 --> 13:36.821
But what about the weapon?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.650
The bad man doesn't take it.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.818
Hm, there wasn't a rod or anything
down at the dock, just blood.

13:41.865 --> 13:44.777
Hold on. There is something else.

13:46.229 --> 13:48.168
Well, I'd say we have a witness.

13:48.214 --> 13:50.716
- A witness with a bad leg.
- Where's he headed?

13:50.724 --> 13:53.265
Oh, there is some fishing boats
moored up in that direction.

13:53.288 --> 13:55.173
Any of these fishermen have a limp?

13:59.451 --> 14:00.849
That looks like a limp.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.267
Sure does.

14:06.842 --> 14:09.098
Dobar Dan. Little English?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.312
We need to ask you a few questions.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.826
- About last night.
- Uh...

14:13.827 --> 14:16.801
A few questions, about last night.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.237
I... I... I saw nothing.

14:20.814 --> 14:22.583
I sleep below.

14:25.378 --> 14:26.954
Nice boat hook.

14:27.332 --> 14:28.614
Looks new.

14:29.371 --> 14:30.923
When did you get that?

14:31.603 --> 14:33.928
Look, please sir, this is important.

14:34.048 --> 14:37.038
We're trying to save a man's
life, and we need your help.

14:40.485 --> 14:43.876
The big man fights the small man

14:43.891 --> 14:46.718
with the hook. Uh, the hook, uh...

14:46.765 --> 14:49.530
gets the big man in stomach.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.144
And, uh...

14:51.468 --> 14:52.950
the small man,

14:53.491 --> 14:56.179
takes his bag, and, uh,

14:56.187 --> 14:59.037
walks away. Uh, big man

14:59.300 --> 15:02.428
uh... uh... gets back in the boat.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.706
Goes to sleep.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.680
- Why didn't you phone the police?
- Uh-uh, no.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.502
I have a job.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.688
I don't want get involved. No, no.

15:11.711 --> 15:15.032
And the small man, what
kind of car did he drive?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.276
No car.

15:16.901 --> 15:19.457
No, he left on foot.

15:19.496 --> 15:21.829
OK, we need you to come with us.

15:27.822 --> 15:30.842
- What is that?
- We need you to see a doctor.

15:35.671 --> 15:37.428
_

15:39.970 --> 15:41.260
Thanks.

15:44.058 --> 15:45.432
Anything new?

15:46.180 --> 15:48.382
I've watched that video twenty times,

15:48.392 --> 15:49.980
my eyes are beginning to cross.

15:49.988 --> 15:52.081
- Doesn't make sense, does it?
- What's that?

15:52.105 --> 15:54.144
Amanti wasn't carrying anything.

15:54.264 --> 15:56.355
- No drugs, no cash.
- Nothing.

15:56.362 --> 15:59.525
So he travels all the way
from Tunis to Corfu, to here,

15:59.779 --> 16:01.595
to meet with our "small man"

16:01.632 --> 16:04.390
- empty-handed.
- The small man is carrying a canvas bag,

16:04.391 --> 16:06.317
maybe he was supposed
to give Amanti something.

16:06.318 --> 16:08.563
- In exchange for?
- If Amanti

16:08.564 --> 16:10.295
double-crossed him,

16:10.306 --> 16:13.542
that might explain why "small man"
swings a boat hook into his stomach.

16:13.543 --> 16:15.002
A boat hook!

16:15.291 --> 16:16.867
What kind of weapon is that?

16:17.649 --> 16:19.187
An improvised one.

16:23.614 --> 16:25.690
Which means our small man

16:25.703 --> 16:27.309
came to that meeting unharmed.

16:28.798 --> 16:30.831
That sounds like a drug deal to you?

16:33.155 --> 16:34.724
He's not a drug dealer.

16:34.915 --> 16:36.269
He's a civilian.

16:37.075 --> 16:39.464
_

16:41.363 --> 16:42.563
Come on...

16:42.985 --> 16:44.196
pick up.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.203
Pick up.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.836
_

16:56.065 --> 16:57.988
Luke, nice of you to join us.

16:57.989 --> 16:59.206
What have you got?

16:59.207 --> 17:01.217
Three set of prints were
found on the boat hook.

17:01.232 --> 17:02.502
Results just came in now.

17:02.518 --> 17:04.568
No surprises on the first set of prints:

17:04.569 --> 17:07.431
The fisherman. Second
set belongs to Amanti.

17:07.455 --> 17:09.315
Which just leave us our civilian.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.858
_

17:13.845 --> 17:15.333
Nigel St. Clair.

17:15.453 --> 17:16.742
Businessman.

17:17.092 --> 17:19.196
His prints were in the EU visa system.

17:19.222 --> 17:21.721
British national, from Hampstead, London.

17:22.035 --> 17:23.628
So how does Mr. St. Clair

17:23.630 --> 17:26.805
finds himself on a
beach in Croatia, at 4 am

17:26.806 --> 17:28.970
with a CLV infected drug mule?

17:28.971 --> 17:31.293
We've got to call every car hire, hotel,

17:31.294 --> 17:33.662
holiday rental and yacht
club on this island.

17:33.663 --> 17:35.383
Let's spread the net.

17:39.445 --> 17:40.745
Sebastian, what have you got?

17:40.754 --> 17:44.959
Hey, um, Mr. St. Clair rented a SUV
and a convertible for his holidays.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.623
Either one of them have GPS?

17:46.624 --> 17:47.826
Unfortunately not.

17:47.827 --> 17:49.542
But the address on the car rental papers

17:49.543 --> 17:52.346
- is for a private residence in Rukavac.
- Text me the address.

18:10.738 --> 18:13.010
_

18:15.582 --> 18:16.997
Mrs. St. Clair?

18:17.072 --> 18:18.864
Inspectors Costante and Strand.

18:18.869 --> 18:20.918
We're here to speak
with your husband, Nigel?

18:20.931 --> 18:23.057
Uh... I'm... I'm sorry, but he's not here.

18:24.245 --> 18:25.576
Would you like to come in?

18:25.976 --> 18:27.176
- Thank you.
- Sure.

18:28.748 --> 18:30.384
A man was killed last night.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.632
We matched your husband's fingerprints
to a weapon found at the scene.

18:33.692 --> 18:35.209
Oh, that's absurd.

18:36.586 --> 18:38.527
You're not gonna ask who was killed?

18:39.998 --> 18:42.955
Well, this has nothing to do with
me or my husband, why should I?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.033
Well, to make your story more convincing.

18:45.774 --> 18:48.115
You should know, that
every cop on this island

18:48.127 --> 18:49.972
is looking for your husband right now.

18:50.237 --> 18:51.760
Mrs. St. Clair, we know

18:51.761 --> 18:53.985
you're covering for him, but
there's not time to waste.

18:53.986 --> 18:56.206
I'm sure I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.498
So, he could be dying right now?

19:12.533 --> 19:13.949
He is not dying yet.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.344
But he is infected, and contagious.

19:16.665 --> 19:18.571
He needs medical intervention.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.200
Sorry.

19:30.017 --> 19:32.102
- Hey, tell me.
- Yesterday afternoon

19:32.114 --> 19:33.845
St. Clair made a large transfer

19:33.846 --> 19:36.040
from the UK to a bank here, on the island.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.663
- How large?
- 50,000 Euros.

19:44.956 --> 19:46.413
I'll call you back.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.223
Where is the child, Evelyne?

19:54.850 --> 19:57.871
They have a boy. I saw the
toys in the rental car.

20:00.171 --> 20:02.811
Where is he? Evelyne, where is your son?

20:05.414 --> 20:07.039
Oh God, please.

20:09.869 --> 20:12.157
They said they'd kill him
if we went to the police.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.483
We can help you, but we need
to know exactly what happened.

20:15.495 --> 20:17.042
When did they take him?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.792
Yesterday morning.

20:19.365 --> 20:21.563
We went to the market, the three of us.

20:22.016 --> 20:23.964
Robbie was beside me, and...

20:24.405 --> 20:27.745
ah, Nigel stopped to look at some
trinkets or something and...

20:28.855 --> 20:30.957
when we turned around, Robbie was gone.

20:31.077 --> 20:33.657
Uh, we thought he just... wandered off.

20:34.414 --> 20:36.713
We searched and searched...

20:36.833 --> 20:38.601
Nigel thought he...

20:39.884 --> 20:42.407
he was hiding somewhere,
playing a game. But...

20:43.241 --> 20:46.686
Oh, God, how could I have let go
of his arm, how could I have done...

20:46.705 --> 20:49.750
You did nothing wrong,
OK? Nothing, nothing.

20:53.806 --> 20:55.179
What happened next?

20:55.299 --> 20:56.703
His mobile rang,

20:57.127 --> 20:59.008
it was the man who took him.

20:59.348 --> 21:03.062
I... I... I... I just don't know
how they got our... our number.

21:03.068 --> 21:05.577
Well, portable scanner, they'd
probably been following you

21:05.578 --> 21:07.129
- for some time.
- Oh God.

21:07.130 --> 21:08.468
Do you have the phone now?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.025
It's here.

21:13.121 --> 21:15.641
They told Nigel to, ah, leave his mobile

21:15.653 --> 21:17.364
behind and... and to get a

21:17.433 --> 21:19.570
a disposable. They gave
us a number to call.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.872
I need that number.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.317
I don't have it. Nigel said he'd call me.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.212
This is very important, Evelyne.

21:26.432 --> 21:28.695
What were the exact instructions?

21:28.696 --> 21:31.271
Nigel was to go to the
dock at 4 am this morning,

21:32.035 --> 21:35.199
carrying a bag with 50,000 Euros.

21:35.683 --> 21:38.038
He did exactly as they said.

21:38.101 --> 21:39.709
And they didn't have our son?

21:39.710 --> 21:41.891
The man was supposed to
have an address on the island

21:41.908 --> 21:43.350
where they were keeping Robbie.

21:44.522 --> 21:47.901
Nigel had the cash, but the man
didn't have the address, he...

21:47.954 --> 21:50.218
he just tried to take the bag.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.451
Nigel said they... they fought, and

21:54.089 --> 21:56.521
- he... he said he stabbed him with a...
- When did you speak

21:56.522 --> 21:57.845
to your husband last?

21:57.855 --> 21:59.595
Well, he came back early this morning.

21:59.612 --> 22:01.024
He came back here?

22:02.203 --> 22:03.793
To clean up and change.

22:04.362 --> 22:06.666
His clothes, did you touch them?

22:06.667 --> 22:08.234
No, he put them in the laundry basket,

22:08.252 --> 22:09.822
I didn't touch anything. I...

22:10.519 --> 22:12.427
and I kissed him, but...

22:13.711 --> 22:15.596
Oh god, I kissed him goodbye.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.569
OK.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.917
We're gonna take care of everything.

22:20.168 --> 22:21.674
Stay right here.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.156
Are you thinking what I am?

22:27.650 --> 22:29.190
The Maussan don't negotiate.

22:29.191 --> 22:31.624
And they don't leave
witnesses, he just got lucky.

22:31.817 --> 22:35.546
The fact he killed Amanti may be the
only thing keeping their son alive.

22:35.547 --> 22:37.519
If he tries to bargain with them

22:37.520 --> 22:39.234
he could kill them both.

22:40.577 --> 22:42.620
I don't want anything to happen to my boy.

22:42.631 --> 22:44.551
I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:44.593 --> 22:45.941
No, we are not.

22:45.976 --> 22:47.178
Evelyne,

22:47.298 --> 22:49.017
we need your help.

22:49.215 --> 22:51.777
We need your help to find your husband.

22:51.806 --> 22:55.459
They said no police. I
can't help you find Nigel!

22:57.380 --> 22:58.810
I can't.

22:59.505 --> 23:02.018
_

23:31.752 --> 23:33.465
You think you can screw me?

23:33.466 --> 23:35.913
Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you all day.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.517
I was waiting for my man. For the money.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.877
Yeah, I brought the money!

23:40.716 --> 23:42.384
Your man tried to kill me.

23:42.476 --> 23:43.692
You're lying.

23:43.812 --> 23:46.009
I think I should kill your son right now.

23:46.010 --> 23:47.210
No.

23:48.401 --> 23:49.601
Please.

23:50.515 --> 23:51.921
We had a deal.

23:51.934 --> 23:54.402
- Deal is off.
- I still have the money.

23:56.357 --> 23:57.845
You promised me.

23:58.893 --> 24:00.165
Where is my son?

24:00.233 --> 24:01.624
I'll give you a location.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.481
You bring the money.

24:03.601 --> 24:04.969
Last chance, ***.

24:04.981 --> 24:06.696
I need proof that he's alive.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.275
Let me talk to him.

24:09.276 --> 24:11.079
- I'll call you.
- No!

24:31.261 --> 24:34.674
This guy will do whatever he wants.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.198
Be ready for tomorrow.

24:45.424 --> 24:46.918
You want chips?

24:47.281 --> 24:48.646
Yes, please.

24:49.626 --> 24:50.915
Thank you.

24:53.488 --> 24:54.690
Fanta?

25:11.352 --> 25:13.752
_

25:14.426 --> 25:15.657
Coffee.

25:15.695 --> 25:16.899
Thanks.

25:17.376 --> 25:19.868
- How's Evelyne?
- Michel's going to speak with her now.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.393
- No Sebastian.
- Any sign of her husband?

25:23.493 --> 25:25.845
Well, probably went into
hiding for the night.

25:25.851 --> 25:27.457
He knows we're looking for him.

25:30.602 --> 25:32.563
I think we have to assume that he does.

25:32.592 --> 25:34.559
Well, we could help him if he'd let us.

25:34.564 --> 25:36.361
I don't think he's gonna take that chance.

25:36.963 --> 25:38.389
Not if he thinks

25:38.390 --> 25:40.392
it risks the life of his son.

25:42.057 --> 25:43.258
You OK?

25:43.476 --> 25:44.685
Me?

25:45.168 --> 25:46.703
I know this stirs you up.

25:47.064 --> 25:48.692
Children, kidnapping.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.250
Yeah, it does.

25:53.741 --> 25:55.579
But I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

26:06.620 --> 26:07.828
Exhale.

26:09.395 --> 26:10.600
Thank you.

26:14.196 --> 26:15.397
Thanks.

26:18.339 --> 26:19.617
Evelyne St. Clair,

26:20.142 --> 26:22.021
my name is Michel Dorn.

26:22.045 --> 26:26.410
I'm the... chief prosecutor for the
International Criminal Court, in The Hague.

26:26.411 --> 26:28.489
Surely, you're not going
to charge my husband?!

26:28.490 --> 26:29.690
No.

26:29.975 --> 26:31.709
No, we just need to find him,

26:31.714 --> 26:33.308
so that we can help him,

26:33.615 --> 26:34.866
and help your son.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.191
I just want to get back to the house.

26:37.191 --> 26:38.513
I wanted you to come here

26:38.514 --> 26:40.076
so that you could see for yourself

26:40.077 --> 26:43.173
- just how grave the danger is.
- I see it.

26:43.182 --> 26:45.208
You're concerned about
the life of your son.

26:45.217 --> 26:47.608
- Well, wouldn't you be?
- Yes, of course.

26:49.168 --> 26:51.951
But your only chance at
saving your son's life,

26:53.095 --> 26:54.444
is if we help you.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.531
They told us

26:57.100 --> 26:59.967
they would kill my boy
if we went to the police.

27:00.153 --> 27:01.377
Regrettably.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.973
These people, they do not leave witnesses.

27:03.974 --> 27:05.447
You're just saying that to scare me,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.497
so that we will help you
to contain this virus.

27:07.507 --> 27:09.374
No, I am telling you the truth.

27:10.117 --> 27:12.839
Your son's only chance of survival

27:12.863 --> 27:14.748
is if you let us help you.

27:15.278 --> 27:16.479
And yes,

27:16.480 --> 27:19.357
every additional minute that
your husband is out there,

27:20.262 --> 27:22.471
the greater the chance for a pandemic.

27:22.898 --> 27:24.567
But we need your help.

27:26.029 --> 27:27.593
And you need ours.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.618
I want you to tell him that,

27:31.206 --> 27:32.676
when he calls.

27:33.751 --> 27:34.956
Will you do it?

27:34.957 --> 27:36.585
He may not call again.

27:39.339 --> 27:41.829
Not if he thinks the
police are looking for him.

27:52.474 --> 27:54.707
_

27:54.708 --> 27:56.031
Don't you sleep?

27:56.032 --> 27:58.044
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

27:58.454 --> 28:00.714
Not after all those espressos anyway.

28:00.917 --> 28:02.124
Where are Luke and Arabela?

28:02.134 --> 28:04.787
At the police station, circulating
a photo of Mr. St. Clair.

28:04.788 --> 28:06.399
We can't have local police touching him.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.174
They've said he's a dangerous fugitive.

28:08.175 --> 28:11.122
They're not to approach him,
just call us if they see him.

28:11.963 --> 28:14.956
I've got Mrs. St. Clair's
phone relayed here. If he calls,

28:15.153 --> 28:16.782
I start an immediate trace.

28:17.064 --> 28:18.422
You still think he will?

28:18.887 --> 28:20.563
It's been 24 hours.

28:21.674 --> 28:23.617
It's our best hope at finding him.

28:24.458 --> 28:25.662
It better.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.668
_

29:01.921 --> 29:05.717
_

29:37.457 --> 29:38.663
Anything?

29:39.102 --> 29:40.306
Where's Ellie?

29:40.977 --> 29:42.887
She'll be back. What do you need?

29:42.888 --> 29:45.013
Arabela's got some bights
on St. Clair's photos,

29:45.014 --> 29:47.700
- she wants your help to check them out.
- I'll let her know.

29:48.768 --> 29:49.972
Hey.

29:50.621 --> 29:51.986
What's your problem with me?

29:51.987 --> 29:53.187
What?

29:53.260 --> 29:55.625
- You heard me.
- Ah, just leave it, yeah?

29:55.626 --> 29:57.931
No no, ever since I met
you, you've been in my face.

29:58.267 --> 29:59.798
Yeah, you hacked my phone.

29:59.807 --> 30:01.648
- Remember?
- Seriously?

30:01.923 --> 30:03.240
That story again?

30:03.430 --> 30:04.910
It must be something more.

30:07.179 --> 30:08.383
It's you.

30:09.072 --> 30:11.665
- Me?
- Yeah. I've spent my whole life

30:11.771 --> 30:14.907
- avoiding folk like you.
- Folk like me? Well...

30:15.009 --> 30:16.731
You may not have noticed, but without me,

30:16.732 --> 30:18.053
you wouldn't be getting anywhere.

30:18.693 --> 30:20.842
- You're just a mess, Sebastian.
- A mess?

30:20.937 --> 30:22.503
Oh, just because I'm not vain?

30:22.507 --> 30:24.809
Just because I'm not an
OCD metrosexual like you?

30:25.766 --> 30:27.351
I mean, your whole life

30:27.522 --> 30:29.216
is one big shortcut.

30:29.217 --> 30:30.966
You know, you're a law enforcement officer,

30:30.967 --> 30:32.941
who can't be bothered to follow the law.

30:33.068 --> 30:34.945
You're a father who
didn't know he was a father

30:34.946 --> 30:36.857
until your son was how old?

30:36.858 --> 30:38.058
Seven?

30:38.227 --> 30:40.809
And now that you know that you
have a son, he's an afterthought.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.810
Everyone can see that he comes last.

30:44.161 --> 30:45.799
Do you think that he doesn't see that?

30:46.317 --> 30:47.517
No, I'm sorry, but

30:47.526 --> 30:50.360
we need to work together, and I
need to know that I can trust you.

30:50.668 --> 30:52.400
Not just to get the job done,

30:52.896 --> 30:54.800
'cause you're brilliant
at that, you really are,

30:55.277 --> 30:56.920
but to get it done the right way.

31:16.043 --> 31:18.169
If watched pots don't boil...

31:21.151 --> 31:23.824
- Sebastian, ready?
- Got it.

31:24.781 --> 31:25.986
OK.

31:26.571 --> 31:27.771
Nigel?

31:27.772 --> 31:28.975
It's me.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.784
Darling, where are you?

31:30.785 --> 31:32.298
All, I can't tell you is...

31:32.665 --> 31:34.075
I'm gonna get him back.

31:34.076 --> 31:35.289
I swear to you.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.217
- Anything?
- North end of the island,

31:37.218 --> 31:38.596
she needs to keep him on the line.

31:38.615 --> 31:40.235
OK, keep him talking.

31:40.235 --> 31:42.649
Nigel, there's something very
important you need to know.

31:42.705 --> 31:44.288
That man you fought with,

31:44.325 --> 31:45.707
he was very ill.

31:46.337 --> 31:47.777
He had a disease.

31:48.904 --> 31:50.667
An infectious disease.

31:51.056 --> 31:52.820
You're very sick, darling.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.420
It's dangerous, and it's contagious.

31:58.344 --> 31:59.885
Look, the police are here.

32:00.183 --> 32:02.540
They just want to bring
you and Robbie back safely.

32:02.541 --> 32:03.932
No, the police

32:04.052 --> 32:06.486
are a death sentence for
Robbie. They told us so.

32:06.496 --> 32:10.058
You can't go near Robbie,
Nigel. Do you understand?!

32:10.077 --> 32:12.169
You're sick. It could kill him!

32:12.784 --> 32:15.263
Don't make contact with
anyone. Do you understand?

32:15.511 --> 32:17.096
Don't go near Robbie!

32:19.612 --> 32:22.532
Mr. St. Clair, this is
Inspector Marco Costante,

32:22.533 --> 32:23.928
please, listen to me.

32:23.929 --> 32:25.696
These men intend to kill your son,

32:25.697 --> 32:28.324
and that's why they double-crossed
you yesterday at the dock.

32:28.352 --> 32:31.699
I can bring him back to
you and your wife, safely.

32:31.713 --> 32:33.408
- Alive.
- I don't believe you.

32:33.412 --> 32:34.914
No, listen to me, ple...

32:37.969 --> 32:40.514
- Sebastian, location?
- No.

32:42.124 --> 32:43.413
"The police

32:43.669 --> 32:46.317
are a death sentence for
Robbie. They told us so."

32:46.318 --> 32:48.930
I knew it. Th... there is
something else in the background.

32:49.366 --> 32:50.645
"No, the police

32:50.939 --> 32:53.334
are a death sentence for
Robbie. They told us so."

32:53.366 --> 32:55.453
Just need to strip out the voice layer,

32:55.454 --> 32:56.719
of the phone call.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.927
A few other layers of sound beneath,

32:58.928 --> 33:01.864
depending on the distance away
from the mobile's microphone.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.109
Let's drop out all the other layers.

33:11.543 --> 33:13.631
Well, seagulls, beach noises.

33:13.632 --> 33:14.884
He's near the water.

33:15.506 --> 33:17.785
Yeah, everywhere on this
island you're near the water.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.125
Last layer.

33:22.315 --> 33:23.545
Is that a motor?

33:24.616 --> 33:26.068
It's a catamaran.

33:29.538 --> 33:30.738
Arabela.

33:31.167 --> 33:32.367
Tell me.

33:32.368 --> 33:34.572
We've found St. Clair's rented convertible.

33:34.573 --> 33:37.366
- You're at the catamaran terminal.
- Yes, how did you know that?

33:37.367 --> 33:38.707
We just figured it out.

33:38.713 --> 33:40.808
That's where St. Clair was calling us from.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.469
He's going to the mainland.

33:44.383 --> 33:46.272
Taking CLV with him.

33:49.548 --> 33:51.879
_

34:01.153 --> 34:03.124
- Daddy?
- Oh, Robbie.

34:04.469 --> 34:06.584
- Are you all right?
- Where are you?

34:07.377 --> 34:09.085
I'm coming to get you, Robbie.

34:09.087 --> 34:10.286
Right now.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.743
It's all gonna be...

34:16.458 --> 34:18.103
Daddy, are you OK?

34:18.995 --> 34:20.203
Sorry.

34:20.370 --> 34:21.570
I've...

34:21.882 --> 34:23.312
I've caught a cold, darling.

34:24.257 --> 34:25.460
Imagine.

34:26.409 --> 34:27.992
Going on holiday, and...

34:28.170 --> 34:29.958
and Daddy getting sick.

34:30.915 --> 34:32.460
But I'll see you soon.

34:35.556 --> 34:36.956
Daddy loves you.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.156
I love you too.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.043
Never forget,

34:41.333 --> 34:42.541
Daddy loves you.

34:44.636 --> 34:45.835
OK?

34:47.596 --> 34:48.799
Robbie?

34:49.893 --> 34:51.708
- Robbie?
- You have proof of life.

34:51.761 --> 34:54.637
- I'm... but I...
- Shut up and listen.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.502
There.

35:02.793 --> 35:04.446
We're on final approach.

35:12.275 --> 35:14.800
_

35:19.136 --> 35:21.512
They're checking each passenger one by one,

35:21.522 --> 35:24.547
at least until we can confirm
whether St. Clair was on board.

36:22.726 --> 36:23.931
There he is.

36:26.689 --> 36:28.206
Nigel St. Clair!

36:28.220 --> 36:30.382
Stop! Stop it! Hey.

36:31.741 --> 36:34.066
I'm here to help you, find your son.

36:34.141 --> 36:36.504
You can't help me. They said

36:36.578 --> 36:38.454
- it needs to be me.
- No, no.

36:38.472 --> 36:40.118
There's another way. Trust me.

36:40.353 --> 36:41.975
No, you have to let me go.

36:43.059 --> 36:44.583
It's too late for me.

36:44.804 --> 36:47.360
- I can feel it.
- No, we can still save your life.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.003
Without my son,

36:49.325 --> 36:50.945
I have no life.

36:52.052 --> 36:54.217
You have to let me go to him.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.080
Please.

37:11.799 --> 37:13.791
Right. Let's try this again.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.728
Do you

37:15.729 --> 37:16.961
have any

37:17.223 --> 37:18.433
kings?

37:18.434 --> 37:19.651
No.

37:19.652 --> 37:21.796
Then you say, "Go fish".

37:21.837 --> 37:24.120
- Nadji ribu.
- What did you say?

37:24.517 --> 37:26.606
That's "Go fish" in Croatian.

37:26.616 --> 37:28.338
Nadji ribu.

37:28.339 --> 37:30.184
Nagee reboo?

37:31.775 --> 37:33.530
Do you have any aces?

37:33.801 --> 37:35.806
Are you crazy, Ludo?

37:35.869 --> 37:37.409
What's wrong?

37:37.410 --> 37:41.493
He is not your friend. Stop
doing this before Kasun hears you.

37:55.537 --> 37:56.741
Yeah.

37:59.260 --> 38:01.206
- Costante?
- Yeah, it's Marco.

38:01.725 --> 38:03.941
We're all here. How is he?

38:03.979 --> 38:06.594
Well, he needs to go to
a hospital, but he insists

38:06.603 --> 38:09.329
he wants to complete the
drop. To save his son.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.585
If anyone else shows
up, they'll kill the boy.

38:11.603 --> 38:13.695
But, if we allow him to go,

38:13.723 --> 38:16.574
then there is an increased
risk of infection.

38:16.581 --> 38:18.586
Especially for you, Costante.

38:18.587 --> 38:19.890
I'll be careful.

38:19.891 --> 38:21.907
I'll need Luke and Arabela to come with me.

38:26.154 --> 38:27.359
Do it.

38:45.143 --> 38:47.109
_

39:19.381 --> 39:21.380
You look like a boiled cat.

39:21.738 --> 39:23.115
Where's my son?

39:23.165 --> 39:24.365
Come with me.

39:26.158 --> 39:27.493
They didn't bring the boy.

39:29.375 --> 39:32.003
Disgusting pig!

39:33.292 --> 39:34.529
Drop the gun!

39:40.045 --> 39:42.159
Arabela, go check what's up the road.

39:42.188 --> 39:43.883
The boy may be close by.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.159
Go!

40:06.553 --> 40:07.770
No more babysitting.

40:07.771 --> 40:09.216
We're not hurting the boy.

40:27.295 --> 40:28.500
Stay down!

40:51.368 --> 40:53.619
Police! Drop your weapon!

41:00.640 --> 41:02.573
Don't move!

41:05.357 --> 41:06.575
Where's the boy?

41:09.502 --> 41:10.982
Where's the boy?!

41:16.674 --> 41:17.881
Where's the boy?

41:24.811 --> 41:26.048
Are you OK?

41:31.125 --> 41:33.226
Someone's been looking for you.

41:34.702 --> 41:35.967
Let's go.

41:38.577 --> 41:39.778
I'm sorry, kid.

41:53.237 --> 41:54.437
What are you doing?

41:57.529 --> 41:59.257
Somebody wants to talk to you.

42:01.205 --> 42:02.412
Nigel?

42:02.631 --> 42:03.836
It's your son.

42:04.870 --> 42:06.073
Daddy?

42:09.280 --> 42:11.395
Daddy, I'm free.

42:36.839 --> 42:38.042
Robbie,

42:38.210 --> 42:40.641
I'm sorry but your dad
can't talk right now.

42:44.035 --> 42:46.560
They said he can't talk right now.

42:47.290 --> 42:48.494
OK.

42:50.576 --> 42:51.780
Let's go.

43:02.120 --> 43:03.320
Mommy!

43:05.361 --> 43:06.578
Robbie!

44:23.471 --> 44:25.852
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry, but

44:25.887 --> 44:27.087
I've got to run.

44:27.112 --> 44:28.313
- Thank you.
- Bye bye Erik.

44:28.376 --> 44:29.579
Hey!

44:35.389 --> 44:37.074
- Good to see you.
- Dad,

44:37.119 --> 44:39.038
you're squeezing too tight.

44:39.117 --> 44:41.384
Oh, that's just because
I missed you so much.

44:42.048 --> 44:43.253
Let's go.

44:44.214 --> 44:45.417
So what's new?

44:45.640 --> 44:47.410
How was school? What did you do?

44:47.992 --> 44:49.195
Nothing.

44:49.196 --> 44:50.856
You can't have done nothing.

44:51.134 --> 44:53.784
We went all over the ***.

44:53.785 --> 44:54.985
That's cool.

44:55.590 --> 44:56.814
How about we go...

44:58.793 --> 45:01.106
- OK. That sounds cool.
- Yeah.
