00:20.126 --> 00:21.518
<i>Grievous in retreat!</i>

00:22.539 --> 00:27.100
<i>Before the battleship Malevolence could
destroy an Outer Rim clone medical base,</i>

00:27.220 --> 00:31.744
<i>a Republic strike force, under
the command of Jedi Anakin Skywalker,</i>

00:31.864 --> 00:35.798
<i>crippled the warship,
disabling its dreaded ion cannon.</i>

00:39.245 --> 00:42.631
<i>All the Jedi relentlessly persue
the Malevolence.</i>

01:05.313 --> 01:07.988
Commander, what is the damage level
to the enemy ship?

01:08.273 --> 01:10.492
She's lost a primary shield
and stabilizes.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.743
But the ship is so massive, it can take
all the fire our cannons can give it.

01:14.093 --> 01:16.314
We must summon reinforcements.

01:16.434 --> 01:18.075
That's why I'm here, Master Plo.

01:18.195 --> 01:20.558
Anakin, were you able to contact
Master Luminara?

01:20.797 --> 01:24.256
Yes, Master. She's busy with a fleet
of separatits reinforcements nearby.

01:24.563 --> 01:26.994
She won't be able to give us support
until she's turned them away.

01:27.114 --> 01:29.202
Then we'll have to make due
with what we have.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.147
We've lost our primary weapon.

01:42.557 --> 01:44.816
The hyperdrive has been disabled.

01:45.679 --> 01:46.440
General?

01:46.560 --> 01:49.029
General, the forward engines
are shutting down.

01:49.558 --> 01:51.322
Impossible!

01:56.540 --> 01:59.082
- Admiral, status report.
- They're not attempting to jump

01:59.202 --> 02:01.624
to hyperspace.
Their hyperdrive must be damaged.

02:02.062 --> 02:03.307
This is our chance.

02:03.427 --> 02:06.546
All ships, target the bridge,
maximum firepower.

02:16.260 --> 02:20.226
It has not sustained extensive damage.

02:20.702 --> 02:22.826
<i>General, I have arranged a trap</i>

02:22.946 --> 02:25.356
<i>which will give you an advantage
over the jedi.</i>

02:25.516 --> 02:27.942
I assure you, that is unnecessary.

02:28.102 --> 02:30.533
<i>Do not compound your failure this day</i>

02:30.653 --> 02:33.656
<i>by allowing our prize warship to fall.</i>

02:33.816 --> 02:37.952
My lord, they will never capture me
or this ship.

02:38.247 --> 02:42.102
<i>Heading towards you
is a very important galactic senator.</i>

02:42.729 --> 02:47.253
<i>With her as your hostage,</i>
<i>they will call off their attack.</i>

02:47.661 --> 02:50.120
As you wish, my lord.

02:53.398 --> 02:55.180
My lady, are you sure

02:55.300 --> 02:58.630
the information
from chancellor Palpatine is reliable?

02:58.750 --> 03:00.778
Yes, it was secretly given to him

03:00.898 --> 03:03.378
by the supreme executive
of the banking clan himself.

03:03.803 --> 03:05.827
If they leave the separatist alliance,

03:05.947 --> 03:08.149
it will go a long way
to shortening this war.

03:09.715 --> 03:11.395
We're approaching the system now.

03:15.774 --> 03:16.950
My goodness!

03:17.819 --> 03:19.236
This isn't right!

03:19.356 --> 03:22.518
That's a droid warship.
We're in the middle of a battle!

03:23.365 --> 03:26.360
Sir, we're scanning a small ship
off our bow.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.838
Good.
Our hostage has arrived.

03:34.627 --> 03:37.697
Master, I'm picking up a signal
near the enemy vessel.

03:37.966 --> 03:39.806
Something just came out
of hyperspace.

03:39.966 --> 03:41.724
- Enemy reinforcements?
- No.

03:42.152 --> 03:44.686
It looks like a Naboo ship.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.920
Gunners, stand down.

03:47.153 --> 03:49.308
What in blazes
are they doing out here?

03:49.428 --> 03:50.900
Ahsoka, contact that ship.

03:53.884 --> 03:57.757
- <i>Naboo cruiser, identify yourself.</i>
- This is senator Amidala.

03:57.877 --> 03:59.868
Padme?
What are you doing out here?

04:00.028 --> 04:03.527
<i>I was sent on a special mission.
The senate was told the banking clan</i>

04:03.647 --> 04:06.332
- <i>wanted to negotiate a treaty.</i>
- Get out of there as fast as you can.

04:07.088 --> 04:09.364
Activate the tractor beam.

04:11.693 --> 04:15.216
- Have we been hit?
- I'm afraid it's much worse than that.

04:17.762 --> 04:18.970
Padme, what's happening?

04:19.130 --> 04:21.973
<i>I'm being pulled inside
the droid cruiser by a tractor beam.</i>

04:29.502 --> 04:31.608
<i>I will not be made
a separatist bargaining chip.</i>

04:31.891 --> 04:36.529
<i>Continue your attack.</i>
<i>You must destroy this monstrous ship!</i>

04:40.909 --> 04:43.869
Admiral,
order our ships to stop firing.

04:56.676 --> 04:59.145
It does not look safe out there,
my lady.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.264
I see now this whole thing was a trap,
and I'm afraid I walked right into it.

05:03.548 --> 05:06.790
Sir, the Republic cruisers
have halted their attack.

05:07.256 --> 05:09.492
Jedi are so predictable.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.587
Get the repair team up here.

05:11.707 --> 05:14.008
Continue working on the hyperdrive.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.547
I'm going down to the main hangar.

05:22.968 --> 05:26.547
This ship must be returned
to Count Dooku intact.

05:33.469 --> 05:35.904
There is no room for failure.

05:36.024 --> 05:37.757
<i>Rail jet departing.</i>

05:43.172 --> 05:45.539
Come on,
I've overloaded the power system.

05:45.659 --> 05:46.975
We're doomed.

05:48.948 --> 05:52.816
- Where do you think you're going?
- Somebody has to save her skin.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.233
I thought you might say that.

05:56.002 --> 06:00.264
I'm afraid Master Skywalker
is taking a terrible risk.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.176
You get used to it.

06:06.112 --> 06:08.121
Come on, 3PO, hurry.

06:08.391 --> 06:11.457
Hurrying, my lady.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.

06:17.769 --> 06:20.361
<i>Welcome to rail
jet substation 9-4.</i>

06:20.481 --> 06:21.901
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

06:22.630 --> 06:23.836
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

06:24.748 --> 06:25.805
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

06:26.097 --> 06:28.063
You two, come with me.

06:38.269 --> 06:41.029
Looks like the engines are set
to destroy themselves.

06:42.203 --> 06:43.693
Get out of my way!

06:43.921 --> 06:45.575
Hey, that's just rude!

06:53.743 --> 06:55.590
Watch what you're doing
with that thing.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.935
Sound the alarm!

07:05.055 --> 07:07.084
We have stowaways on board.

07:15.487 --> 07:19.145
I trust you've already formulated
a brilliant plan to rescue the senator.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.468
As a matter of fact, I have.

07:21.588 --> 07:23.237
But do we have a plan "B"?

07:23.397 --> 07:25.406
Every operation
needs a backup, Anakin.

07:25.769 --> 07:29.827
I don't have a backup... yet, but I do
have a plan for getting on that ship.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.267
Really?

07:31.649 --> 07:33.798
The enemy sensors
are obviously damaged,

07:33.918 --> 07:36.979
so we'll sneak in behind them
and dock at the emergency airlock.

07:37.286 --> 07:38.550
That's your plan?

07:38.670 --> 07:40.109
Just fly there, land,

07:40.229 --> 07:42.590
hope they don't spot us,
and walk in the door?

07:43.268 --> 07:44.175
Basically.

07:45.269 --> 07:47.011
Brilliant. Let's get going.

08:03.269 --> 08:06.080
Pardon me, but might
I suggest we keep moving?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.407
I think I hear battle droids
approaching.

08:08.567 --> 08:11.023
But we also need
to contact the fleet.

08:11.386 --> 08:13.996
If I can just get
this comm panel working.

08:17.459 --> 08:20.128
My lady, I'm afraid I was right.

08:26.468 --> 08:27.826
- <i>General?</i>
- What?

08:28.059 --> 08:31.019
<i>The damage to the hyperdrive
was not as bad as we first thought.</i>

08:31.139 --> 08:33.432
<i>We should be able
to get under way again shortly.</i>

08:33.708 --> 08:35.684
I must inform Count Dooku.

08:35.984 --> 08:37.048
Stay here.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.938
Continue the search.

08:39.183 --> 08:42.164
Find the stowaway
and bring them to me.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.808
Roger, roger.

09:04.642 --> 09:06.883
If they spot us,
we'll be pulverized.

09:07.161 --> 09:09.137
They're too busy repairing the ship.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.262
They don't have time to notice us.

09:11.644 --> 09:14.348
Subtlety has never been
one of your strong points, Anakin.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.727
Everything I know
I learned from you, Master.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.313
If only that were true.

09:30.724 --> 09:32.366
- What was that?
- What?

09:32.701 --> 09:34.728
That noise.
Didn't you hear it?

09:35.103 --> 09:38.247
It sounded like a ship docking
at one of the emergency airlocks.

09:38.834 --> 09:42.168
Your circuits are loose.
No one's crazy enough to do that.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.545
Anakin, you're crazy.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.923
Spinning is not flying.

09:47.263 --> 09:50.676
- But it's a good trick.
- We do not want to be spotted.

09:50.996 --> 09:53.471
- I knew it! It's them!
- No.

09:57.311 --> 09:58.351
You stay here, R2.

10:00.192 --> 10:03.356
<i>Another bold strategy
by Skywalker, I presume.</i>

10:03.608 --> 10:06.834
- That's my master.
- Once they make it off that ship,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.449
we'll need reinforcements
to finish off the enemy.

10:10.106 --> 10:11.572
<i>I am on my way, Master Plo.</i>

10:11.732 --> 10:14.540
We're receiving a transmission
from inside the Malevolence.

10:14.844 --> 10:16.118
I believe it's the senator.

10:18.244 --> 10:18.919
Yes.

10:19.039 --> 10:21.984
<i>Master, we've found the senator.
I'm patching her through.</i>

10:22.104 --> 10:23.334
- Padme?
- <i>Anakin.</i>

10:23.634 --> 10:25.240
<i>Are you all right?
Where are you?</i>

10:25.360 --> 10:28.630
On the lower levels.
I'm fine, but I don't know for how long.

10:28.843 --> 10:31.884
- Droids are everywhere.
- Obi-Wan and I are on board too.

10:32.248 --> 10:34.011
What?
What are you doing here?

10:34.264 --> 10:36.261
We came to get you off this ship.

10:36.381 --> 10:38.057
Ahsoka,
how can we get to the senator?

10:38.729 --> 10:40.584
According to our scans,
there seems to be

10:40.704 --> 10:43.021
a larger open area
in the center of the ship

10:43.141 --> 10:45.231
It should be halfway
between the two of you.

10:45.706 --> 10:47.775
We're on our way.
Did you hear that, Padme?

10:48.118 --> 10:49.324
I'll be there.

10:54.976 --> 10:58.586
General, we just detected
an unauthorized communication

10:58.706 --> 11:01.372
- coming from within the ship.
- What did it say?

11:01.944 --> 11:02.944
Well...

11:03.728 --> 11:05.101
We don't know.

11:05.537 --> 11:07.909
We didn't catch it in time.

11:08.162 --> 11:11.066
Monitor all internal communications.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.927
I want that senator on this bridge.

11:21.678 --> 11:24.921
- I don't see her, Anakin.
- She's here, master. I sense it.

11:30.717 --> 11:32.486
This is where we're supposed
to meet them.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.777
He's probably late again.

11:35.897 --> 11:38.386
But we do have company
of another sort.

11:39.239 --> 11:40.453
Blast them!

11:43.639 --> 11:44.556
There!

11:53.504 --> 11:54.945
Look, Jedi.

11:55.065 --> 11:56.677
- Fire!
- No, wait.

11:59.490 --> 12:01.390
I knew that was a bad idea.

12:03.061 --> 12:03.903
Jump!

12:05.795 --> 12:07.305
Who, me?

12:12.947 --> 12:13.788
Padme!

12:18.690 --> 12:19.565
{\Anakin!}

12:26.746 --> 12:28.125
There they are.

12:28.369 --> 12:29.168
Fire!

12:33.909 --> 12:35.966
- The bridge is out.
- Jump to me.

12:37.038 --> 12:38.926
You have to trust me.

12:42.883 --> 12:45.476
- I've got you.
- Nice catch.

12:46.011 --> 12:47.728
I'll fetch the droid.

12:52.142 --> 12:54.360
The things you do to get me alone.

12:54.881 --> 12:56.008
Stop talking.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.494
What is going on?

13:11.973 --> 13:14.839
Stop me, please!

13:15.305 --> 13:17.357
Blast,
that's not good.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.821
Anakin, I got separated
from your droid.

13:20.941 --> 13:21.661
3PO.

13:22.512 --> 13:23.779
I'll take care of it.

13:23.899 --> 13:26.684
- We'll meet you back at the Twilight.
- No, we can't leave yet.

13:26.844 --> 13:29.770
I overheard Grievous.
Their hyperdrive is almost repaired.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.885
I'm already headed
in that direction,

13:32.005 --> 13:35.151
so I'll make certain
that the hyperdrive stays offline.

13:37.615 --> 13:41.323
We'll see about that, Jedi.
Come with me.

13:41.682 --> 13:45.578
I'm getting you out of here.
R2, I need you to help me find 3PO.

13:45.738 --> 13:47.192
He's on the rail jet.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.749
I know. I know. He does.

13:50.111 --> 13:52.918
Look, just find him for me,
and I'll be there soon.

13:58.288 --> 14:02.042
Someone stop this contraption,
please!

14:08.115 --> 14:10.221
I suppose I did ask for that.

14:32.576 --> 14:33.758
Hello, there.

14:41.022 --> 14:42.593
General Kenobi,

14:42.936 --> 14:47.181
did you really think I would leave
the hyperdrive unguarded?

14:47.341 --> 14:48.890
Anything is possible.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.976
You haven't exactly
impressed me today.

14:52.709 --> 14:53.854
Kill him.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.133
That was impressive.

15:27.349 --> 15:28.880
Guard the hyperdrive!

15:29.123 --> 15:31.616
I will deal with this Jedi myself!

15:40.962 --> 15:43.019
Obi-Wan? Come in, Obi-Wan.

15:43.139 --> 15:45.978
<i>Anakin,
I'm afraid Grievous is on to us.</i>

15:46.098 --> 15:47.575
Yeah, we noticed.

15:49.778 --> 15:51.662
<i>We'll rendezvous
back at the Twilight.</i>

15:51.782 --> 15:53.774
<i>The fleet must engage the...</i>

15:53.894 --> 15:55.958
Obi-Wan? Come in. Obi-Wan!

15:56.383 --> 15:58.002
- What's wrong?
- They're jamming us.

16:08.107 --> 16:11.515
- That might buy us some time.
- I suppose you have a plan.

16:11.942 --> 16:13.037
Follow me.

16:14.647 --> 16:18.085
I do believe I'm lost...
in enemy territory...

16:18.565 --> 16:19.732
and all alone.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.888
Don't shoot!
I surrender!

16:24.560 --> 16:26.065
R2-D2, my

16:26.561 --> 16:28.740
you are a sight for short circuits.

16:30.543 --> 16:32.723
Master Anakin sent you to find me?

16:32.945 --> 16:34.324
What kept you then?

16:38.472 --> 16:40.990
The General is demanding
a status report.

16:41.110 --> 16:43.525
Is the hyperdrive repaired yet?

16:43.645 --> 16:44.923
It's almost done.

16:45.642 --> 16:47.456
I'll give him the good news.

17:01.483 --> 17:04.609
Ever since I've known you,
you've been playing with droids.

17:04.888 --> 17:08.722
I used to put them together.
Now I only take them apart.

17:09.055 --> 17:10.281
So where do we start?

17:10.940 --> 17:14.507
First we need to get rid of these droids
so they won't know we were here.

17:14.627 --> 17:17.873
I'm gonna hotwire the ship,
give Grievous a little surprise.

17:18.540 --> 17:21.251
I guess I'll clean up
the droids then.

17:24.936 --> 17:28.133
Our ships are in attack position.
Any word from master Skywalker?

17:28.471 --> 17:31.653
No, the droids are jamming
our transmissions.

17:31.896 --> 17:33.889
We need to give him more time.

17:34.049 --> 17:35.967
I'm not sure we can.

18:20.272 --> 18:22.688
That ought to do it.
How's the housecleaning going?

18:23.360 --> 18:24.923
Done.
Let's get out of here.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.959
I guess repairs are finished.

18:32.079 --> 18:35.008
- Prepare to charge up the hyperdrive.
- Roger, roger.

18:40.312 --> 18:42.750
R2, are you quite certain
the ship is in this direction?

18:44.602 --> 18:46.376
This way
looks potentially dangerous.

18:47.462 --> 18:49.631
I know the whole place is dangerous!

18:50.153 --> 18:53.669
I suggest we stay here
and let master Anakin find us.

18:54.293 --> 18:56.847
3PO, what are you doing?
Don't just stand there.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.807
Let's get back to the ship.

18:59.646 --> 19:02.497
- Power up the engines, R2.
- Hold the ship!

19:09.259 --> 19:11.033
I'll contact the fleet.

19:12.324 --> 19:13.947
R2, release the docking clamp.

19:36.534 --> 19:40.057
- Time for some clever tricks, Anakin.
- That's what I was thinking.

19:47.766 --> 19:49.691
All batteries, open fire!

19:57.925 --> 20:00.687
You know, we have guns.
You can shoot back any time.

20:00.807 --> 20:02.683
- I was just about to...
- I got it.

20:08.977 --> 20:10.712
She seems to know her way around.

20:16.495 --> 20:19.570
<i>General, the hyperdrive
has been completely repaired.</i>

20:19.690 --> 20:23.628
<i>- Should we retreat to friendly space?</i>
- Engage the hyperdrive.

20:23.748 --> 20:27.229
I'll meet you at our secret base
in sector four.

20:27.910 --> 20:31.071
You heard the General.
Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.

20:31.191 --> 20:32.192
Yes, Sir.

20:44.364 --> 20:46.999
- Nice shot, senator.
- Beginner's luck.

20:48.385 --> 20:50.938
Pardon me, Sir,
but R2's scan of the enemy's ship

20:51.058 --> 20:53.012
indicates their hyperdrive
is activating.

20:53.132 --> 20:54.756
- Don't worry about it.
- What?

20:55.108 --> 20:58.149
Coordinates are locked.
Hyperdrive is engaging.

20:59.794 --> 21:01.847
I think we have a problem.

21:02.007 --> 21:04.725
<i>General, there's something wrong
with the hyperdrive.</i>

21:05.108 --> 21:07.644
I thought the hyperdrive was fixed.

21:08.586 --> 21:11.607
The navicomputer is heading us
right into the moon!

21:11.951 --> 21:14.401
Fools, reset the navicomputer!

21:14.737 --> 21:16.956
Quick, reset the navicomputer!

21:19.468 --> 21:23.410
<i>General, we await the Malevolence
at the rendezvous point.</i>

21:23.862 --> 21:25.996
<i>Have you made your escape yet?</i>

21:28.233 --> 21:29.520
No, reset it...

21:30.231 --> 21:31.059
General?

21:32.158 --> 21:33.158
General?

21:38.620 --> 21:41.094
Transmission has been cut off, Sir.

21:41.254 --> 21:43.597
I think the General did it himself.

21:43.757 --> 21:45.709
We're gonna die! Abandon ship!

21:51.640 --> 21:53.774
I imagine you had something
to do with that.

21:54.782 --> 21:56.735
All part of the plan, Master.

22:05.397 --> 22:08.247
<i>Next, all new
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i>

22:08.407 --> 22:10.791
Nothing going on.
As usual.

22:10.951 --> 22:14.171
Landed on the most boring post,
in the Outer Rim.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.505
- And one of the most important.
- What the...

22:19.144 --> 22:20.276
It's an ambush!

22:21.742 --> 22:22.844
Send the alarm!

22:23.004 --> 22:24.080
This way, hurry!

22:24.200 --> 22:26.181
We have to retake this base.

22:31.430 --> 22:33.021
You wanted excitement.

22:34.305 --> 22:40.487
