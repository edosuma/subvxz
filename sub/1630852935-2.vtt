00:07.340 --> 00:09.300
- Hey, hold up, wait up!
- Watch out!

00:09.384 --> 00:12.387
- Hold on, where is everybody going'?
- Where do you think, Proud?

00:12.470 --> 00:14.848
- To see Makeup Boy at the mall.
- Who?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.599
Makeup Boy!

00:17.517 --> 00:19.060
Where have you been, Penny?

00:19.352 --> 00:22.355
He's only the biggest
makeup influencer on the planet!

00:24.024 --> 00:28.236
All right, basics, listen up.
You want to slim down those chubby cheeks,

00:28.486 --> 00:32.115
hide that fivehead,
and cover up them nasty pimples.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.200
- And when you're finished,

00:34.284 --> 00:38.371
set with my sold-out setting spray
and get ready to slay.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.456
Uh-uh!

00:39.664 --> 00:42.542
Normally, I sell this-ish for $35,

00:42.625 --> 00:46.713
but if you swipe up now and use my code
"Makeup Boy" in all caps,

00:46.796 --> 00:49.591
and make sure it's all caps, sis,
'cause it's not gonna work,

00:50.008 --> 00:53.219
you can get it for $34.99.

00:54.512 --> 00:58.141
Is he serious? You guys aren't falling'
for this-ish, are you?

00:58.224 --> 01:02.062
Ninety-six, Ninety-seven,
Ninety-eight, Ninety-nine.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.523
- Penny, you think you can loan me $34?
- No!

01:05.607 --> 01:09.360
Hey, you'll! We better get to the mall.
The line's gonna be too long.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.530
Makeup Boy is signing autographs
for only $20.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.948
Wow, Maya.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.951
You're the last person I thought
would be into makeup.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.037
You being all-natural and everything.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.915
Girl, please, this look is a process.

01:27.045 --> 01:31.132
Besides, there's nobody more woke
than Makeup Boy.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.344
Well, he certainly
didn't wake up like that.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.805
- Zang.
- Don't be a hater, Penny.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.056
Why?

01:38.139 --> 01:39.599
Because I won't give someone

01:39.682 --> 01:42.477
$20 for an autograph
because they're trending?

01:42.602 --> 01:46.564
Because I'm not trying to hide behind
a faceful of foundation and lip gloss?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.067
Because I have a mind of my own?

01:49.359 --> 01:52.737
You should really consider hiding that
face behind something, Proud.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.324
Maybe then you'd have more than
your mum and dad as followers on Hologram.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.201
- Holla.
- Come on, y'all,

01:58.284 --> 02:01.496
I got my little brother holding a place
in line for us at the mall.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.499
- Et tu, Dijonay?
- No, I haven't eaten yet.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.834
What is that on your forehead?

02:06.417 --> 02:09.587
So, Makeup Boy says, "Wearing' duct tape

02:09.671 --> 02:12.257
five-minutes a day
keeps the wrinkles away."

02:12.549 --> 02:15.760
Dijonay, you're only 14.
We don't have wrinkles.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.055
- And we never will!
- Hey!

02:19.264 --> 02:20.598
You coming' with us, Penny?

02:20.682 --> 02:24.185
Nah, I'm gonna do something
a little more useful with my $20.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.187
- Hey!
- Like burn it.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.647
Can't see anything.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.862
Come on, guys, I got my 20. Let's go.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.865
I can't believe I just did that.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.410
Can I have my glasses back,
please? Whoever you...

02:44.289 --> 02:46.332
The... Proud... Family... What?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.710
You and me will always be tight

02:48.793 --> 02:50.962
Family every day and every night

02:51.296 --> 02:53.506
Even when you start acting like a fool

02:53.590 --> 02:56.092
You know that I'm loving'
every single thing you do

02:56.176 --> 02:58.469
I know I can always be myself

02:58.553 --> 03:00.847
When I'm with you more than anybody else

03:00.930 --> 03:03.266
Every single day
that I'm headed off to school

03:03.349 --> 03:05.810
You know there's no one
I love as much as you

03:06.269 --> 03:08.771
The family the family

03:08.855 --> 03:11.107
Proud family

03:11.191 --> 03:14.068
They'll make you scream

03:14.152 --> 03:15.904
They'll make you wanna sing

03:15.987 --> 03:19.157
It's a family thing, a family
a proud, proud family

03:19.240 --> 03:20.783
Proud family

03:20.909 --> 03:23.870
They'll push your buttons!

03:23.953 --> 03:26.206
They'll make you wanna hug them.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.875
A family a family proud, proud family

03:28.958 --> 03:30.001
Proud, proud family

03:32.420 --> 03:33.922
Oh, Oscar.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.884
Oh, I can't stand them!

03:38.218 --> 03:39.344
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.720
What were y'all doin'?

03:43.598 --> 03:44.807
- Nothing, baby.
- Nothing, baby.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.436
- What're you upset about, Penny?
- My friends.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.232
They're all at the mall giving
Makeup Boy $20 for an autograph.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.235
Oh, yeah, that boy who gives makeup tips.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.695
A boy that does makeup?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.656
What is your generation coming to, Penny?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.242
I don't know, Daddy. They're like zombies.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.245
They do what any random noob
tells them to do.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.414
Relax, Penny. We did the same thing
when I was a kid.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.042
Everybody used to dress up like Prince.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.670
The girls and the boys.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.880
- Who's Prince?
- Who's Prince?

04:17.131 --> 04:20.760
Okay, gather round, y'all.
Let Daddy tell you about Prince.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.973
Baby, it's easy

04:26.349 --> 04:27.809
Trudy!

04:27.892 --> 04:30.186
Dig if you will the picture

04:31.479 --> 04:34.065
Of you and I engaged in a kiss

04:35.483 --> 04:38.194
The sweat of your body covers me

04:38.653 --> 04:41.155
Yeah, can you my darling?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.116
Can you picture this?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.535
Dream, if you can, a courtyard

04:46.577 --> 04:49.205
An ocean of violets in bloom

04:50.623 --> 04:54.294
Animals strike curious poses

04:54.669 --> 04:58.214
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

04:58.298 --> 05:00.925
How can you just leave me standing

05:01.843 --> 05:05.680
Alone in a world that's so cold? So cold

05:05.888 --> 05:07.640
Maybe you're just too demanding

05:07.724 --> 05:09.517
Ah! Trudy!

05:09.600 --> 05:13.229
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
Maybe you're just like my...

05:17.358 --> 05:18.609
What is that on your forehead?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.362
Yeah, I got it at the mall
from that Makeup Boy.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.909
- Whoo! That fella sure know his stuff.
- You too, Suga Mama?

05:29.704 --> 05:32.999
All right, I'm only gonna
say it once, so listen up.

05:33.082 --> 05:37.295
The lip color of
the month, basics, is blue.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.339
But not just any blue, my blue.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.133
And to get my blue,
I need to see some green.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.218
The baddest has spoken.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.221
This is sad.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.807
All you need is a stupid video
and three likes,

05:49.891 --> 05:52.185
and suddenly, the whole world
wants to follow you?

05:52.268 --> 05:54.854
Penny! Penny, baby!

05:55.271 --> 05:58.191
Come on down here
and clean your Suga Mama dentures.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.361
- Yuck! It's Wednesday already?
- I heard that.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.654
Sorry, Suga Mama. I'm coming.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.328
You know what? I'll show them.

06:12.997 --> 06:18.127
Hey, y'all. I'm Penny, and welcome to
the premiere of Growing' Up Proud.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.131
Question, have you ever had to
clean your grandmama's dentures?

06:38.689 --> 06:39.690
Come back here.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.744
What?

06:51.828 --> 06:52.912
Come back here!

07:17.395 --> 07:18.604
Hey!

07:34.328 --> 07:35.413
Penny!

07:37.248 --> 07:39.459
Penny, since when did
you start wearing' dentures?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.127
Lose a fight at school, baby girl?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.004
No, Daddy. What are you talking' about?

07:43.087 --> 07:44.922
These boxes are addressed to you, Penny.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.924
It must be a mistake. I didn't... Snap!

07:47.008 --> 07:48.968
- Oh snap.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.428
Ooh wee!

07:50.595 --> 07:55.808
Minty Fresh Mr. Denture, my favorite.
Papi, I think I died and gone to heaven.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.068
Put your chompers back in
your head, Suga Mama. This is for Penny.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.196
Well, what happened to my grandbaby?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.781
You lose a fight at school
like your daddy?

08:10.990 --> 08:13.284
No, actually I think I won.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.996
I made a video of me cleaning your
dentures to prove a point to my friends

08:17.079 --> 08:19.957
that anybody can get followers,
and I was right.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.627
Oh, I can't wait to rub it in their faces.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.838
And I can't wait to rub this into my grin.

08:34.597 --> 08:39.310
Bam! 10,000 followers in one day.
What did I tell you?

08:39.393 --> 08:43.439
Wham! Makeup Boy got 50,000
in the time it took you to say, "Bam."

08:43.564 --> 08:45.066
Shazam!

08:45.149 --> 08:46.776
Who cares about dentures anyway?

08:46.859 --> 08:50.780
Apparently, enough people
to make my video go viral.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.240
Enough old people.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.076
- Congratulations, Martha Stewart.
- Who?

08:55.159 --> 08:56.369
Some grandma who makes cakes

08:56.452 --> 08:58.704
and hangs out with this granddaddy
rapper named Snoopy.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.250
His name is Snoop Dogg.
He our cousin, nephew.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.796
And he produced our latest track,
which we selling' for $19.99.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.091
But we don't have money for a CD.
We're broke.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.176
We ain't doing' no CDs.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.137
We do wax. We old school.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.266
Well, Nubia, we're broke school.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.102
We gave all our money
to Makeup Boy yesterday.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.478
Proud didn't.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.773
Really, LaCienega? It's like that now?

09:25.856 --> 09:28.359
Nah, uh-uh, keep your skrilla, Proud.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.153
What you gonna do
is drop our track on your next video.

09:31.237 --> 09:35.324
That was just a one-time thing, Nubia.
I was just proving a point.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.869
Hey, Proud, you done seen that
Bottle Cap Challenge?

09:50.047 --> 09:51.841
Well, Olei gonna do that with your head.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.927
Uh, I could probably do one more video.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.028
Ouch!

10:12.111 --> 10:14.572
Rochelle, play the turntable!

10:14.822 --> 10:16.616
Girl, what's a turntable?

10:18.034 --> 10:21.245
Whoa, now. Hold on, baby girl.
I'll show you how to do that.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.749
See, this and an eight-track
was all we needed back in the day.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.792
I'd go to your mother's house,

10:27.001 --> 10:30.129
turn the lights down low,
put on some Switch...

10:30.796 --> 10:32.757
Ooh, and then what?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.092
Her father'd turn on the lights,

10:35.176 --> 10:37.428
put on Shirley Caesar,
and throw my Black butt out.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.596
Trudy!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.598
Those were the days.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.356
Take them. I hope you didn't pay for this,
baby girl.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.359
Hands up, cash out

10:51.442 --> 10:52.985

10:53.152 --> 10:55.696

11:03.287 --> 11:05.081

11:09.627 --> 11:12.963
We finna blow up.
You got the juice, Proud.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.344
I do?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.138
Penny Proud here.

11:21.222 --> 11:26.227
Today's episode of Growing' Up Proud
is called "Two Babies, One Diaper."

11:31.148 --> 11:36.904
Okay, Pride, for today's look, I'm wearing
I-got-it-from-my-Suga-Mama jeans.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.073
- You got what from Suga Mama?
- These jeans.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.952
Nope, I'm not having' it.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.162
My baby girl
is not wearing' these clothes.

11:45.246 --> 11:49.625
But Wizard Nova's paying' me to wear them,
Daddy. They even sent me a check.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.421
Check, schmeck. If they think that
they're gonna buy my baby, then they...

11:58.134 --> 12:00.261
Trudy!

12:05.891 --> 12:08.436
Ugh! That is not my angle.
Delete it, basic.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.313
Oh, no, I won't. I just paid you $50!

12:11.772 --> 12:14.483
Then you're deleted, basic.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.609
Next.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.364
We're next! Me and my girls
wanna do a group selfie.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.450
That'll be $50, right?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.702
So, you're trying' to scam Makeup Boy?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.662
$500, basic.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.998
- Zang!
- Makeup Boy.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.459
But that's okay. We got you, Makeup Boy.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.336
Uh-uh, no, we don't, Maya.
Keep your money.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.088
This jerk is just ripping you off.

12:36.172 --> 12:41.427
Ooh, look who's getting spicy.
It's D-level influencer Penny Prude.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.053
Like, are you even verified?

12:44.346 --> 12:46.307
Whatever.

12:46.390 --> 12:50.603
That's right, basic. Walk away.
But what you really need to do

12:50.686 --> 12:54.815
is sharpen up that contour
and fix that tired mug of yours.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.609
I've been saying that for years.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.569
Does she have her
own setting spray?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
- I don't think so.
- That was a read.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.114
That was stone-cold, Makeup Boy.

13:02.698 --> 13:03.908
Basic.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.127
Penny Proud here.

13:15.211 --> 13:20.174
Since when are over-baked boys the
authority on the way girls should look?

13:20.424 --> 13:21.967
- What?
- Wait a minute.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.554
On top of that,
he's gonna insult us and take our money?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.639
Zang!

13:26.722 --> 13:30.893
It's a new day, Pride.
Makeup Boy is cancelled.

13:33.020 --> 13:37.566
No, my lip gloss. My settings...
Are you kidding me?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.110
Come back, basics. Come back.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.197
Nubia was right. I got the power.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.449
I got the juice.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.537
What is the definition of an influencer?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.664
One who has the power to make people

13:51.747 --> 13:55.292
buy things they probably don't need
or can't afford.

13:55.584 --> 14:01.298
And with great power comes great fear...
fear of getting cancelled by me.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.344
And just keeping it real, people,
I kinda like it.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.806
I know I'm not supposed to, but I do.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.101
Hey, you'll. What's up?

14:12.184 --> 14:15.729
There's no room for you
at this table, Proud. Go away.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.356
Oh, you got a problem, LaCienega?

14:17.439 --> 14:20.150
It's just that lately
you haven't been yourself, Penny.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.152
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.738
What you did to Makeup Boy
was not cool, Proud.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.115
You ruined his life!

14:27.533 --> 14:28.534
No way!

14:29.076 --> 14:30.202
Oh, really?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.622
I don't think I like you
anymore, LaCienega.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.541
Who cares what you like, Proud?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.084
She gonna get cancelled.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.335
Everybody.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.798
Hey, Pride,
I just got a traffic alert, you'll.

14:42.882 --> 14:47.761
Guess what?
LaCienega Boulevardez... is closed.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.471
Please seek alternate friends.

14:57.688 --> 15:01.025
Bye...

15:02.776 --> 15:06.238
...bye!

15:08.699 --> 15:11.160
Ooh, that was
Principal Hightower calling, Oscar.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.913
Penny's been late to school
every day this week.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.790
- But we didn't hear that from her.
- Oh, oh-oh.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.709
I wouldn't wanna be Principal Hightower

15:18.792 --> 15:20.294
when Penny hears she ratted her out.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.380
- Oscar, you need to talk to her.
- Why me?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.049
'Cause you're the man of the house.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.593
Oh, now I'm the man. The way I see it,

15:27.676 --> 15:29.929
the person who always brags
about making' the most money

15:30.012 --> 15:31.722
should be the one doing all the talking.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.727
It's a darn shame.
You'll scared of you'll own child.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.937
But I'm not.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.231
- Hey! What up, fam?
- I'll tell you "what up."

15:41.398 --> 15:44.109
The principal called and said
you've been late every day this week.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.236
Oh, she did, did she?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.113
Suga Mama,
you just got that woman whacked.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.365
Shut up, boy.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.824
Penny, you're grounded.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.090
Don't you eyeball me, girl.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.602
You don't want none of this smoke.
Get on up to your room.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.106
Say hasta la vista to Suga Mama.

16:28.946 --> 16:34.034
Hey, Pride. It's a sad, sad day
in the Proud crib.

16:34.118 --> 16:40.749
My Suga Mama has got the sugars.
She's gotta lose 50 pounds or else.

16:40.833 --> 16:46.547
Help me help her, Pride.
Help me... help her.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.593
We're here to save you, sugar bear.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.804
Save me? Save me where?

16:53.929 --> 16:55.931
My boot camp. No pain, no gain.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.434
We're Gonna get your weight down
so you can feel your toes.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.146
- Bufferina.
- Hold her tight, Bufferina.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.355
- Hold still...
- Let me go!

17:03.439 --> 17:05.482
- before I crush you.
- Where you takin' me?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.569
Dr. Payne, my good man, as you can see,

17:08.652 --> 17:12.448
she's in denial about everything.
Except for cookies. Lots of cookies.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.200
So, please, take care of my dear mother.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.037
Hopefully, forever.
And her little dog too.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.334
I'm gonna get you, Oscar. You...

17:31.175 --> 17:32.718
Uh. Officers.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.888
Officers, please.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.474
Unhand me, you glorified hall monitors.

17:38.682 --> 17:42.227
Ooh. She shouldn't have dropped
that dime on Penny.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.772
Well, I would say let's go to class,

17:44.855 --> 17:48.942
but Penny's gotten rid of all the
teachers, janitors, hall monitors,

17:49.026 --> 17:51.070
the school nurse. Pretty much everybody.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.739
Now, come on, y'all.
Homegirl is trippin' trippin'.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.700
- We gotta do something' about this.
- You better squash that.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.079
- You trying' to end up like LaCienega?
- Who cares what you like, Proud?

18:00.162 --> 18:03.373
I like strawberry ice cream.
You don't like pizza? Well, I like pizza.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.792
And you ruined Makeup Boy's life.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.043
Hey, y'all, what's going' on?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.545
- Everything's good, boss.
- Everything's good.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.798
- You looking good.
- How about you, boss?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.425
Nothing. Since you
got rid of Principal Hightower,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.302
the teachers,
and everybody else up in here.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.388
- You got a problem with that, Maya?
- Yes. I do.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.350
You know, at least
Makeup Boy was making people look good.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.895
- You're destroying lives, Penny.
- And don't you forget it.

18:27.689 --> 18:32.069
Hey, I'm just kidding'. Lighten up,
Lil' Kim. It's just business.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.614
Oh, so, I get it. You're a sellout, too.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.249
Be careful, Maya,
before she drops a video on you.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.212
Maya didn't mean it, Penny.
Did you, Maya? Tell her. Quick.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.713
Sure, Penny.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.382
I didn't mean it.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.717
Glad you know what time it is, Maya.

18:56.176 --> 19:00.806
It's boring around here.
Ooh, let's go to the movies.

19:00.889 --> 19:04.977
Penny, there are no more movies.
You gave them all bad reviews.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.146
All right, well, let's go to Wizneyland.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.815
Nope, you closed that down, too.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.319
Wiz?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.823
Hey, Wiz, is that you? It's Oscar.
Oscar Proud.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.700
Let's meet about that deal we discussed.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.201
Hello?

19:22.870 --> 19:25.289
What is it? Can't you see
I'm on the phone?

19:26.039 --> 19:27.916
What do you mean, I'm not on the phone?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.085
Hologram Live? How do I cut this off?

19:35.924 --> 19:38.760
KG, let me holla at you for a second.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.810
Let's see how many
millions of followers I have today.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.652
What is happening?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.121
Hightower? What're you doing' here?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.499
Penny Proud. I've been looking for you.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.212
I regret to inform you
that you've got detention.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.255
Every day for the next year!

20:15.422 --> 20:17.090
- Have a nice day.
- What?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.468
Hey! Don't walk away from me.

20:20.219 --> 20:24.348
- LaCienega, who let you out of the locker?
- I did. What's up?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.016
- It's Maya. Come on.
- Bye.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.144
Oh! So, you wanna take her place?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.939
A lot has changed since
I came out of the locker, Proud.

20:32.147 --> 20:35.234
Yeah. Your reign of terror
is over, forehead.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.237
Yeah, even I'm not scared of you anymore.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.823
I guess you haven't checked
your Hologram lately. Have you, Penny?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.450
Yeah, I've checked my Hologram.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.912
- What did you do?
- You cancelled.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.082
You know you're not the only one
who can make a video, right, sis?

20:50.707 --> 20:53.710
And the new number one on Maya's
sellout list,

20:53.794 --> 20:56.380
toppling Uncle Ruckus after a record

20:56.463 --> 21:00.509
600 weeks in the top spot... Penny Proud.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.763
The girl that will sell anything,
including you.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.349
And I was just sent
the video that proves it.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.812
Here you go, Oscar Proud.
Something you ain't never seen before.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.106
One big old bag of money, you'll.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.069
You just made a wise investment,
Wizard, my man.

21:19.152 --> 21:23.198
I guarantee. my daughter won't disparage
on any more of your many businesses.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.034
If the Pride knew
that Penny Proud's daddy

21:26.118 --> 21:28.912
was takin' money and Salisbury steak
under the table...

21:30.706 --> 21:31.748
...I hate to think of the

21:31.832 --> 21:34.543
consequences of such
an unscrupulous transaction,

21:34.626 --> 21:36.920
You'll. The Pride? Those sheep?

21:37.004 --> 21:39.798
They'll do whatever Penny
tells them to do. Give me my steak.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.628
- Hey, there.
- Miss Sophie, where are you?

22:18.712 --> 22:21.214
- Who do you belong to?
- Sophie.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.008
Miss Sophie.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.761
Miss Sophie, where are you?

22:25.844 --> 22:29.056
Thank you, I thought I lost her.
Penny Proud?

22:29.139 --> 22:31.141
I don't want any trouble, Makeup Boy.

22:31.224 --> 22:34.603
Girl, my name is Sebastian Boyle.
Look, it's all good.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.524
Ooh. She likes you. You want her?

22:39.608 --> 22:43.487
- You selling puppies now?
- No, sis. I'm rescuing them.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.405
"Save the beagles"?

22:45.947 --> 22:49.284
Yeah. They use these
poor babies to test makeup.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.621
Isn't that right, Miss Sophie? It's awful.

22:52.829 --> 22:56.708
Aside from kicking some butt,
I figured this was the least I could do.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.127
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

22:59.211 --> 23:03.173
And you know what? I owe it all to you,
Penny Proud. Thank you.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.257
What?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.301
You don't owe me anything.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.845
What do you mean? Yeah, I do.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.390
I had lost sight of who I was.

23:11.473 --> 23:15.310
I was seduced by the juice,
and you made me see all that.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.023
Don't let it happen to you, Penny Proud.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.193
- Sophie.
- Yeah, too late.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.404
Make sure to take everything.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.948
Oscar, they're taking everything!

23:28.031 --> 23:31.201
Not everything.
For the first time, I've won, Trudy.

23:31.284 --> 23:34.663
I put that big old bag of money
I got from the Wizard, in the bank,

23:34.746 --> 23:36.748
and there's nothing he can do about it.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.375
Great, Oscar!

23:38.458 --> 23:41.128
Wait a minute,
what bank did you put it in?

23:41.211 --> 23:45.132
I opened a brand-new account
at the Wizard Kelly Federal Union.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.633
I even got me a new toaster.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.261
Wait a minute. Did I say Wizard Kelly?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.599
No!

23:54.724 --> 23:57.727
I can't believe this. He got me again!

23:58.270 --> 23:59.980
Well, at least we got rid of Suga Mama.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.366
Hello, son.

24:11.450 --> 24:16.163
Oh, snap! It's Suga Knight
and she's swole. Jailhouse buff.

24:16.246 --> 24:20.834
Yeah. Thanks to my homie, Dr. Payne,
I'm ready to inflict some.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.836
Time to get rough, Puff.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.640
No, Suga Mama.

24:37.267 --> 24:41.897
Look, it's my fault. I had you sent
to boot camp, and I owe you an apology.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.609
In fact, I owe all of you an apology.
I was wrong.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.486
I was seduced by the juice.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.739
You hear that, Suga Mama?
Penny's been drinking too much juice.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.242
- I hope you all can forgive me.
- Of course we forgive you, baby.

24:54.576 --> 24:58.246
Oh, Penny, you're my grandbaby.
You can do no wrong.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.792
But your daddy... that's another story.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.093
Let me go!
