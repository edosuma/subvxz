It was good. I escorted
some CEO to the airport.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.902
I helped another one's wife get

So... What's going on?

03:08.772 --> 03:10.479
I mean, you said
you were ready.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.181

03:12.317 --> 03:13.432
Listen, it's been
six months, Nicole.

I get it, hasn't been easy, living
in hiding, changing your name...

Eric, I'm fine.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.947
Okay, I'm just... (SCOFFS)
I'm just worried you're not.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.529
You're barely
eating or sleeping.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.990
I hear you outside, punching
that bag at all hours.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.199
What do you want from me?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.918
Seriously, what... Just tell me,
what do you want me to say?

03:33.004 --> 03:35.291
I just... I think you
still need more time.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.008
You gotta get past everything
that happened to you over there.

They're good.
All right?

03:52.274 --> 03:53.890
We got a future here.
So...

03:55.026 --> 03:57.313
We should start acting like it.
Okay?

03:57.612 --> 03:58.602
Hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.532
I'll make you coffee.
Okay.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.995
And pull hard copies of everything
we put together on the Haddads,

04:16.505 --> 04:19.123
including ground recon
going back six months.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.343
Thanks, Andy. I'm already late.
My husband's gonna kill me.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.546
She's cutting it close.
Maybe I should call.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.055
She'll be here.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.883
I just sent you some changes
for the fundraiser's speech.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.514
Uh... Let me know what you think.
Yeah, will do.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.513
We're gonna have
a lot of eyeballs on it.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.764
There she is.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.774
I was beginning to think this
was gonna happen without you.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.398

04:49.706 --> 04:50.696
Case files?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.657
I have another transition
meeting with Mullins.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.207
Ithoughtyou
were done with those.

We didn't get through
everything last time.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.294
(SIGHS) So, I'm gonna have to go
directly to the fundraiser from CTU.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.926

I won't be late.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.628

05:05.931 --> 05:07.296

Did the Hallowells confirm?

05:09.184 --> 05:10.515
We're still waiting to hear.
Hmm.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.225
Yes, right here.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.103

Senator, over here.

tend to move in herds.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.100

05:20.737 --> 05:22.728
But we'll need them to get
to the White House. Hmm.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.772
Not that this'll hurt.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.516
on the compound
of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid,

06:00.610 --> 06:03.477
killing him and eight members
of his terrorist organization.

award the Congressional Gold Medal

made that victory possible.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.725
This is such an honor
and so humbling.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.724
I'd like to
acknowledge the many

06:39.482 --> 06:44.693
dedicated people at CTU, whose hard
work made this operation a success.

06:46.615 --> 06:51.405
And the Army Rangers, six heroes who
risked their lives to stop Bin-Khalid

06:51.494 --> 06:53.826
from carrying out his threat
to attack this country.

use his cabin up in Riverwoods.

out this weekend.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.083

07:08.887 --> 07:10.127

to calm down, okay?

What are you doing?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.058
I'm signaling the squad.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.852
How? I thought you weren't supposed
to have any contact with each other.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.558
That you just made
an exception for Ben?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.442
We don't have contact.

It's a double-blind alert.

taking Ben seriously?

that they're okay and...

get him cleaned up.

gonna send him to rehab?

even know I went to Stanford?

minutes after we met.

my cousin was Edgar Styles.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.424

Okay, good. Let's move on
to the Haddad network.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.031
I'm up to speed
on the Haddads.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.781
Sorry, I just need to make
sure nothing's overlooked.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.828
No, understandable,
but I'm on it.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.336
I noticed you made
some personnel changes.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.918
Where I thought better choices
were available.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.467
Better than Basheer? He is the
expert on extremist social media.

You're the one who chose me,
as your replacement.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.183
I mean, you need to
trust me to do the job.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.429
You're right.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.266
Running CTU, it's like a drug.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.813
Hard to come down from.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.612
So, maybe you're just
not ready to let go.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.743
The party asked John
to run four years ago.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.287
He said no, because of me.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.533
He knew I
couldn't track Bin-Khalid

16:01.627 --> 16:03.538
and work on his campaign
at the same time, so...

16:03.838 --> 16:04.999
(PHONE VIBRATING)

16:05.089 --> 16:08.252
I promised, once we got
Bin-Khalid, it was his turn.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.253
I'd be there for him.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.555

16:15.892 --> 16:18.600

We're blown.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.224
The whole squad.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.810
What?
Bin-Khalid's people found us.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.488
They have our new names and three
of them just broke into our house.

Your... Your wife,

16:44.712 --> 16:48.626
She's with me. But you need
to know, this isn't payback.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.005
They're looking for
a strongbox

16:50.092 --> 16:52.003
they said one of us stole
from Bin-Khalid's compound.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.131
I don't know why
and I don't know what's in it.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.929
Bin-Khalid was planning
an attack on US soil.

16:58.017 --> 17:03.262
Maybe this strongbox is part of
that weapon or intel on a target.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.436
Whatever it is,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.644
Ben must be
the one who took it.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.310
Why? Why would he do that?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.775

17:10.738 --> 17:12.228

for him at the end.

Do you know where he is?
No.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.651
No, he's paranoid.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.108
He... He started shooting up
and he lives off the grid.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.152
I'll have Keith Mullins
try to track him down.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.203
No! No, three people had
access to our new names.

17:23.291 --> 17:27.580
The Directors of CIA, NSA and
CTU, which is now Keith Mullins.

17:28.756 --> 17:29.837
I've known Keith for years.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.502
I can't believe
he'd give up the squad.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.132
But he did have access.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.172
Yes.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.470
Then it could be him and I'm not
gambling our lives on that.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.552
Listen, you need
to help us find Ben.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.725
I don't know where he is but I have
the number that he called me from.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.473

17:48.985 --> 17:50.146

17:51.779 --> 17:54.146

All right, I'll send
the number to you now.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.528
And then I'll need to get
Nicole somewhere safe.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.110
I can't help you.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.071
And the police and the FBI are in the
same network that's been compromised.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.200
They're not an option.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.669
Call me when you find Ben and I'll...
I'll recover the strongbox.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.745

18:12.592 --> 18:15.880

Why would you say that?

texting this guy.

all of this terrorist stuff.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.459
Yeah, about the struggle, about
destroying the American oppressors

21:36.545 --> 21:38.456

going to prove herself.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.379
I... I know this is crazy,

21:40.466 --> 21:43.959
but I'm starting to think that's why she
came here from Chechnya with her brother.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.134
To do this.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.717
Do you understand how serious
this is, what you're saying?

21:49.225 --> 21:51.717
Yeah. That's why I've been
trying to talk to her.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.811
What are you gonna do?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.723
This school has a policy
about this kind of thing.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.853
I have to take it
to the principal.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.392
Yeah, but Amira's gonna know
that I said something.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.228
There's nothing I
can do about that now.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.943
If you're right about her,

22:07.243 --> 22:08.654

What are you saying?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.495
I'm saying that
it's possible that

23:02.298 --> 23:04.505
Keith gave up the rangers.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.459
So we need to do
this in secret.

wrong about this?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.337
I'm not.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.715
And what happened
to those rangers,

23:13.934 --> 23:15.470
it's just the start
of something worse.

up with John's campaign.

use for a little while?

Listen. Listen.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.555
Nicole, I can't take
you to the police, okay?

23:58.687 --> 24:01.896
I can't take you to the FBI because
Bin-Khalid's people are in the system.

You and me left all
this for a reason.

makes sense to me right now.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.741
And he's still family.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.618
You think because
he's your brother

he's just gonna
forget what happened?

do with me though?

they're gonna kill a lot of people.

stop them...

ask your government.

I can't.
Why not?

to take care of Nicole or not?

Hold on, hold on.

(PHONE RINGING)

42:16.951 --> 42:17.941
Don't come after me.

42:18.953 --> 42:19.988
You won't find me.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.156
<i>Ben.</i>

42:22.206 --> 42:24.243
Ben, tell me where you are.
Where's the chip?

42:24.792 --> 42:26.829
Just listen. If the
government wants this list,

42:27.336 --> 42:28.451
they're gonna have to pay up.

42:28.588 --> 42:29.578
What?

42:30.339 --> 42:31.454
You heard me.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.713
Ben, listen to me.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.963
Just bring back the list before
Bin-Khalid's people find you.

42:36.179 --> 42:38.967
Maybe I'll find them, huh? See
what they're willing to pay.

42:39.265 --> 42:42.053
No, Ben.
Ben, you won't do that, okay?

42:42.143 --> 42:43.133
You wouldn't do that.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.301
I'll do what I have to.

42:44.854 --> 42:45.969
I meant what I said, Eric.

42:46.439 --> 42:47.895
I'm owed.
Ben!

42:48.483 --> 42:50.850

always looked out for you.</i>
