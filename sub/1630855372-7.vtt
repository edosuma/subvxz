WEBVTT

00:48.173 --> 00:49.758
Nicolás, everything will be all right.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.510
- Okay, <i>Mami.</i>
- Just get your clothes together.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.061
<i>Mami.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:47.501
<i>Mami.</i>

02:54.132 --> 02:55.968
Yeah! Hey, you go, Nick!

02:58.428 --> 02:59.513
Good work!

03:01.306 --> 03:02.266
Boy!

03:02.266 --> 03:03.642
Hey.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.941
That's my dawg.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.784
That's my son!

03:26.874 --> 03:30.627
Crystal. You see?
I'm getting the hang of this, bruh.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.920
One, two, three. Gimme a one--

03:31.920 --> 03:34.923
Hey, I want you to meet a friend of mine.

03:36.258 --> 03:40.512
- "Friend" as in...
- As in I'm grown. He's a nice guy.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.730
- Mekhi.
- Jace.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.899
Nice to meet you.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.584
<i>Te amo.</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:14.421
Everyone, gather around. That's it.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.298
- Come on. A little bit closer.
- Come on.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.466
I don't bite.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.094
First, I want to thank all of you
for coming out.

04:21.094 --> 04:26.808
Everyone here at this party contributed
to our son becoming the man that he is.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.101
Yeah. Yes.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.187
And before I start crying, right,

04:31.021 --> 04:33.023
I wanna say how happy I am that my husband

04:33.023 --> 04:35.609
and oldest son are able
to share in this occasion.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.488
I mean-- Because they
were a big part of this journey.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.700
Working three jobs so that Nick
and I can fly back and forth,

04:44.701 --> 04:46.787
and so that Nick can go
to the best schools.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.956
I'm not going to cry.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.584
I remember, after Hurricane Maria...

04:54.878 --> 05:00.551
we decided as a family not just to rebuild
our home, but to rebuild our dreams.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.262
Yes. All right.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.597
And now my son is 18

05:05.597 --> 05:07.599
and planning his collegiate future.

05:10.519 --> 05:15.023
<i>Y Fabian</i>, my eldest,
he just applied to law school.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.993
And so, after Nicholas
graduates and he's settled in college,

05:27.369 --> 05:28.954
I'll be heading back to Puerto Rico...

05:33.876 --> 05:35.836
where I'll miss you all.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.758
And I'll try to figure out life
as an empty nester with Oscar.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.015
All right. Everybody,

05:48.015 --> 05:51.643
let's celebrate and salsa dance
all night long, huh?

05:59.484 --> 06:00.819
Go. Go!

06:07.868 --> 06:09.244
Almost got this, baby.

06:09.912 --> 06:10.913
My guy.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.208
Happy birthday, man.
I know we've been through a lot.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.084
No matter what...

06:16.084 --> 06:17.377
We fam.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.339
Just fam or something else?

06:26.470 --> 06:27.471
Peace.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.772
You think everybody knows?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.443
Hope not. But if you keep up
with the googly eyes,

06:41.443 --> 06:43.403
- they probably will.
- It's like that?

06:48.784 --> 06:49.993
So what if they do know?

06:58.252 --> 06:59.920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.930
Yo, might wanna shout at ol' girl.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.060
Make us proud, young fella.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.108
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.109
What's your name?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.861
- CJ.
- I'm Pilar, nice to meet you.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.218
- Coach, you got a minute?
- Yeah. What can I do for you?

07:49.178 --> 07:52.264
My father has taken ill.
It's pretty serious.

07:53.098 --> 07:57.603
Thought I'd drive out to Virginia,
go see him, have CJ tag along with me.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.105
By all means. Of course.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.317
I know how critical
their first playoff game will be.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.985
I will have him back in time.

08:05.569 --> 08:09.281
Okay. Just keep us posted,
and I hope your pops pulls through.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.617
- Thank you.
- Of course.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.452
All right.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.336
Hey. <i>Feliz cumpleaños,</i> young king.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.504
Appreciate you, Alonzo.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.880
Of course.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.299
Come on. It's time to party, boy.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.092
- See you.
- Okay.

08:30.385 --> 08:34.597
Yeah. Yes.

08:48.779 --> 08:49.780
Yeah.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.826
- Hey, Coach.
- Hi, CJ. You having fun?

08:55.327 --> 08:56.328
Yeah.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.497
You mind a word of advice?

08:59.831 --> 09:00.874
No.

09:01.583 --> 09:06.672
You are already impressive, especially
when you don't try to impress everyone.

09:32.948 --> 09:33.949
Oh, God.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.291
I dare you.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.962
So, we're taking the Bougie Beast.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.924
Rolling through the backcountry,
flaunting all your dough.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.053
You say, "flaunt," I say, "inspire."

10:38.555 --> 10:41.099
Looks like a vampire attacked you.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.021
Yeah. You know,
it must have been something I ate.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.773
Some kind of allergic reaction.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.362
I guess it must be hereditary
because I had the same allergic reaction

10:53.362 --> 10:54.863
when I was your age.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.131
Listen to that.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.677
A thing of beauty.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.889
You know I have my permit, right?

11:21.557 --> 11:23.892
- Right.
- You should let me drive her.

11:23.892 --> 11:28.355
My Pearl?
From Maryland all the way to Virginia?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.984
I can't think of a better way
to improve my driving skills,

11:31.984 --> 11:34.695
especially with you right by my side.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.283
Damn. That's a hell of a pitch, son.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.868
- So, that's a yes?
- Hell no.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.328
Buckle up, Chuck.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.083
My grandfather, Arthur Harrison,

11:48.083 --> 11:52.421
had a vision for a school that could
develop the future leaders of our country.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.799
And he wanted our leaders to be educated,

11:55.799 --> 11:58.552
have compassion,
and be independent thinkers.

11:59.761 --> 12:04.766
He financed his endeavors and handpicked
administrators and teachers.

12:04.766 --> 12:08.061
Tuition was high
so the school could sustain itself

12:08.604 --> 12:12.399
and also offer opportunities for young
people who couldn't afford to attend.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.319
And when my mother
became chair of the board,

12:16.278 --> 12:19.114
she wanted to expand
the school using other people's money.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.577
And before we knew it, any big donor
could have a seat on the board,

12:24.203 --> 12:26.663
a policy I tried to get rid of
once I became chairperson.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.376
But now there's a waiting list
for anyone who wants to be on the board.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.795
And anyone who wants to donate 25K,

12:33.795 --> 12:37.090
they're thrilled if I can have a 15-minute
Zoom meeting with them.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.595
You're largely responsible
for that, Emory.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.555
Thank you.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.018
But I also need you to take ownership
of where we are right now.

12:49.895 --> 12:53.899
The Cedar Cove Four travesty
has blindsided all of us.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.568
And in the last quarter,

12:57.069 --> 12:59.196
fund-raising has been down 30%.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.823
You urged me to hire Coach Edwards.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.536
And you urged us to admit Jace Carson,

13:05.536 --> 13:09.414
Drew Murphy, Musa Rahaim,
and most recently, Phil Marksby.

13:11.792 --> 13:16.839
I'm not here to slam you. I'm here to talk
about the one unavoidable truth.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.552
If we're gonna right this ship,
we have to do something enormous.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.762
More enormous than the state championship.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.514
You're talking about
a national championship?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.975
You practically guaranteed that
at the top of the year.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.896
With all the distractions,
we crawled ourselves into playoffs.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.273
So you have a chance.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.360
We do.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.488
You need to make the most of it.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.912
It is unfortunate that the current head
of school has not been a bigger influence

13:48.912 --> 13:51.039
on strengthening our standing
as an institution.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.917
I wish I was in a position to do more.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.213
That is certainly something worth noting.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.648
How do you feel about going back home
after all this time?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.526
It'll be good for you
to meet your grandfather.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.361
What's he like?

14:22.696 --> 14:23.822
A man of his time.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.909
What does that mean?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.703
If he gets his mind made up
about something,

14:29.703 --> 14:31.455
ain't shit you can tell him.

14:33.207 --> 14:36.210
That's the vibe he gave off
in that picture of him in the photo album.

14:37.503 --> 14:38.504
The army one?

14:39.296 --> 14:40.756
That's when he was in Vietnam.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.884
Your grandmother would say
he came back changed,

14:43.884 --> 14:47.846
as if he lost something
that the world owed him.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.850
Everything left in his tank
went to his farm.

14:53.310 --> 14:58.190
By the time I was 14, I spent
every spare moment I had at the gym,

14:58.941 --> 15:02.486
away from him, away from the farm,
away from his temper.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.113
- He was violent?
- No.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.450
He just didn't like me.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.828
And I didn't like him.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.416
Grandma said she divorced him
after you started making money.

15:18.836 --> 15:22.464
I bought her that house,
and he never forgave me.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.717
You never thought about buying him one?

15:27.302 --> 15:28.637
He stopped taking my calls.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.765
So why exactly are we going to see him?

15:33.809 --> 15:36.436
Your aunt said that his diabetes
is getting the best of him.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.355
He doesn't have much time.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.234
He left the hospital 'cause he wants
to die in his own bed.

15:42.818 --> 15:43.652
Yeah, but--

15:43.652 --> 15:46.905
And I need to tell my father something
that I never told him.

15:53.287 --> 15:54.538
It'll be good to meet him.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.708
Yep.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.222
What's good, Coach?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.057
Hey. What's up, man?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.602
So...

16:17.978 --> 16:18.979
You and Crystal, huh?

16:19.813 --> 16:20.689
Yeah.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.276
There's a lot of hurt girls out there
right now.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.695
- Uh-huh.
- But you know how it is.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.405
Oh, yeah. When I married Tonya,

16:29.573 --> 16:31.742
it was a pandemic
of broken hearts out there.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.786
- Yeah, right. Yeah.
- Okay.

16:34.786 --> 16:38.874
Listen, I called every
top-rated D1 coach out there.

16:39.875 --> 16:44.379
Those that like you
already gave away the scholarship money.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.008
And the others
still want to see what happens.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.511
What happens?

16:50.511 --> 16:54.389
Like if I decide
I wanna jump somebody tomorrow?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.682
What are you talking about?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.185
They don't want a player
that's a distraction.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.528
Now, they also don't want a player

17:07.528 --> 17:10.321
who's only shooting 20%
from the three-point line.

17:10.321 --> 17:14.326
I average 29 points a game.
Who cares if I hit threes?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.038
Lately? Just about everyone.

17:18.622 --> 17:22.209
The narrative about you not being able
to shoot, that's spreading.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.545
What about UCLA?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.672
They got you under a microscope.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.425
But it's still in play.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.846
If we lose, we out.

17:36.139 --> 17:40.060
But if we win, we keep our season alive,

17:41.395 --> 17:45.899
and the further we go in Nationals,
the more eyes will be on you.

18:06.712 --> 18:07.963
I gotta make a phone call.

18:08.630 --> 18:12.134
Yeah. Tell your vampire friend
your dad says hello.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.434
Lakeview is coming off a upset

18:20.434 --> 18:23.061
of Fort Penn, okay?
So they're gonna be amped-up for us.

18:23.061 --> 18:23.979
Hi.

18:24.563 --> 18:28.150
Sorry to bother you.
By any chance, can you talk?

18:28.901 --> 18:30.819
Sure. Is everything okay?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.071
I'm on this little road trip with my pops.

18:33.864 --> 18:37.826
Yes, I heard about your grandfather.
I'm sorry.

18:38.535 --> 18:42.456
Thanks. My father wants to tell him
something that he never told him before.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.879
And I was thinking
maybe I should tell my father

18:48.879 --> 18:50.797
something I never told him before.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.382
Excuse me. Hi there.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.676
It feels like if I don't tell him
on this trip

18:54.676 --> 18:58.472
then things are gonna get busy
and I might lose the nerve.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.018
Okay. Well, if it's something you need
to get off your chest,

19:03.519 --> 19:04.895
by all means, talk to him.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.689
I thought a lot about
what you said at the party.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.441
- Okay. Take care.
- Thank you so much.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.734
<i>About being yourself?</i>

19:12.110 --> 19:17.574
If I'm being honest, it made me think
I haven't been completely honest.

19:17.574 --> 19:21.161
Well, the quickest way to fail in life
is to try and please everyone.

19:21.787 --> 19:25.123
Hey, Casanova. Let's go.

19:27.125 --> 19:31.421
I gotta go. Thanks, Coach.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.756
<i>Of course.</i>

19:35.676 --> 19:37.135
I mean, we can pull it off.

19:37.135 --> 19:41.223
It's just about getting them all
to commit. But, I mean, we'll see.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.102
Guys.

19:45.102 --> 19:49.773
How about we hold off on breaking down
the playoff schedule for a second.

19:50.357 --> 19:56.530
Look, ever since I told you I knew
the team was planning not to apologize

19:56.530 --> 19:58.866
to that commission for defending Crystal,

19:59.950 --> 20:03.287
it's been a little off with us.

20:03.287 --> 20:08.166
A little tense. And I'm thinking
maybe we should clear the air.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.004
Air is clear as far as I'm concerned.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.257
I'm good.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.217
Okay.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.183
Not sure what you want me to say.

20:24.766 --> 20:28.604
You had info about my son
that could have jeopardized his future,

20:29.313 --> 20:30.814
and you kept it to yourself.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.235
I'm not okay with that. But I'm here.

20:35.819 --> 20:39.239
Jace shared the news with me
in confidence.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.326
I can't teach him to be a 24-hour person,

20:42.326 --> 20:43.577
if I'm not being one myself--

20:43.577 --> 20:45.078
You so caught up with Jace

20:45.078 --> 20:47.706
as if somehow that's gonna squash
the shit you had with your dad.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.833
- The hell you say?
- You guys. Hey.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.668
You don't want Jace to flame out.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.796
You want him to have
the future that you never had.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.881
We all get it.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.342
What about Royale?

20:59.092 --> 21:00.594
Do you know he's tormented

21:01.220 --> 21:03.722
because his debate teacher is scheduling
competition times

21:03.722 --> 21:04.932
that conflict with games?

21:05.516 --> 21:08.435
You know, Drew's trying to figure out
if he's gonna play ball at a D3 school

21:08.435 --> 21:10.270
or maybe walk on a D1.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.441
Nick's family is desperately trying
to get the attention

21:14.441 --> 21:17.277
of the Puerto Rican national team
after he fell off their radar.

21:18.862 --> 21:19.863
And Musa.

21:22.282 --> 21:26.119
You know, Musa has no idea
why he's losing minutes

21:26.119 --> 21:30.332
in his senior year
because you don't communicate.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.836
And with all due respect, Ike.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.757
Your dad, he wasn't just about 24.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.885
He was about 22 and two.

21:42.928 --> 21:48.308
Two hours of practice and for
the players' lives, the other 22 hours.

21:49.268 --> 21:52.729
Jace is not the only player
that's trying to figure out his future.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.363
Ready?

22:45.532 --> 22:46.617
As I'll ever be.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.344
- Aunt Constance.
- CJ.

23:09.139 --> 23:11.683
Getting even more handsome every time
I see you.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.646
Hey, little sis.

23:15.646 --> 23:16.855
Hey, big bro.

23:19.733 --> 23:20.734
Welcome home.

23:26.615 --> 23:30.869
<i>Bless us, Lord</i>

23:31.662 --> 23:35.749
<i>Take my hand</i>

23:37.918 --> 23:40.003
Thanks for covering all his medical bills.

23:40.671 --> 23:42.631
- You didn't tell him?
- Of course not.

23:42.631 --> 23:45.425
<i>Help me stand</i>

23:45.425 --> 23:46.510
How's he doing?

23:47.970 --> 23:49.012
He's holding on.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.722
...<i>I am tired</i>

23:50.722 --> 23:52.558
I think he's holding on for you.

23:53.308 --> 23:57.479
<i>I am weak</i>

23:57.479 --> 23:58.814
Hey, coz.

23:58.814 --> 24:03.360
<i>I am worn</i>

24:04.611 --> 24:09.199
<i>Through the storm</i>

24:09.199 --> 24:14.329
<i>Through the night</i>

24:14.830 --> 24:20.252
<i>Lead me on</i>

24:20.252 --> 24:25.549
<i>To the light</i>

24:25.549 --> 24:30.387
<i>Take my hand</i>

24:31.013 --> 24:35.684
<i>Precious Lord</i>

24:36.268 --> 24:43.233
<i>And lead me home</i>

24:55.287 --> 24:56.288
Thank you.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.384
Hello, Grandpa.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.346
I'm Camden Junior.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.681
Everyone calls me CJ.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.071
And as you can see,

25:29.863 --> 25:33.825
your good looks may have skipped my dad,
but they didn't skip me.

25:49.883 --> 25:50.884
Son.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.056
Hey, Pop.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.201
Sorry you're going through this.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.079
You deserve better.

26:21.957 --> 26:25.502
Hold on. Come on.
Stop being stubborn, old man.

26:25.502 --> 26:26.587
Listen to me.

26:27.963 --> 26:32.176
You deserve better.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.395
I have something to tell you.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.150
Something you don't know.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.280
The only reason I made it to the NBA...

26:55.782 --> 26:56.992
is because of you.

26:59.828 --> 27:03.457
When I got cut my first season,
everyone thought I was done.

27:05.918 --> 27:09.588
But you taught me how to be tough.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.883
And to never back down.

27:24.645 --> 27:27.856
You taught me how to be a man.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.153
You did that, Daddy.

27:37.616 --> 27:42.454
I don't know what part
of you got lost in Vietnam.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.251
Why you never laughed.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.212
Or why you never cried.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.842
You were a mystery to me.

27:58.345 --> 28:02.975
And still, everything I am...

28:05.143 --> 28:09.815
everything I've ever had,
is because of you.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.110
So grateful.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.268
Your grandfather assembled that
for Camden.

28:48.854 --> 28:52.733
No offense, but y'all didn't have
a Dick's Sporting Goods?

28:53.901 --> 28:57.404
He doesn't think we should spend a dollar
for another man's work

28:57.404 --> 29:00.574
when we could save a dollar
and do the work ourselves.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.744
My father said they didn't get along.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.913
Well, you know why, don't you?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.666
Because they're just alike.

29:11.835 --> 29:15.214
Nah. My father definitely believes
in spending money.

29:15.797 --> 29:20.594
Because in the two hours it takes
to fix a plumbing problem or a car engine

29:20.594 --> 29:23.472
or assemble a basketball hoop,

29:24.348 --> 29:26.266
are two hours my brother could find

29:26.266 --> 29:30.771
to make more money with his broker,
accountant, or real estate agent.

29:31.438 --> 29:34.733
He values time
the way my father values a buck.

29:36.985 --> 29:40.113
Now that sounds like him.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.622
Come back inside when you're ready.

31:58.961 --> 31:59.962
Dad?

32:02.464 --> 32:03.465
Dad!

32:06.760 --> 32:07.761
Nurse!

32:17.688 --> 32:18.856
I'm so sorry.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.075
Daddy's gone.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.711
Goodbye, Daddy.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.100
I'll call you later tonight
about the arrangements, okay?

33:37.100 --> 33:39.728
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

33:52.407 --> 33:53.242
You drive home.

34:13.804 --> 34:14.888
All right. Be careful, son.

34:15.389 --> 34:16.389
She's powerful.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.809
Go slow at first.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.143
As soon as you tap the gas it--

34:24.606 --> 34:26.190
- Sorry.
- Uh-huh.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.485
<i>Come on. Let's go, Jace.</i>

34:31.446 --> 34:32.447
Come on.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.449
Damn.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.159
You don't have to make every three,
just 35%. Let's go.

34:38.536 --> 34:41.790
- I just went two out of ten.
- It's 'cause you're all in your head.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.543
Need me to show you how it's done?

34:45.627 --> 34:46.837
I know how it's done.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.422
Is my man a baller?

34:49.422 --> 34:50.424
He's a baller.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.053
And by the way, I made a call.

34:55.971 --> 34:58.140
The assistant coach of UMD
is coming to your game.

34:58.724 --> 34:59.933
I'm a charity case now?

35:00.517 --> 35:01.602
Bruh, really?

35:02.436 --> 35:04.855
I met a lot of people
during my recruiting visits.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.191
It wasn't hard to find out who to ask.

35:07.691 --> 35:08.817
So what you ask them?

35:09.526 --> 35:11.445
If your man could go to college with you?

35:11.445 --> 35:13.197
Is that such a bad idea?

35:14.406 --> 35:16.867
You cute and all,
but I'll probably get tired of you.

35:16.867 --> 35:19.620
I'm tired of you now, but ball out anyway.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.246
Come on. Let's work.

35:21.914 --> 35:22.915
Put it up.

35:34.885 --> 35:35.886
You okay?

35:37.763 --> 35:38.847
Yeah.

35:39.681 --> 35:40.682
I am.

35:43.602 --> 35:44.770
I'm glad you came with me.

35:46.396 --> 35:47.439
Me too, Dad.

35:49.942 --> 35:53.320
Pretty deep that you got to tell Granddad
something you've been holding on to.

35:54.446 --> 35:57.324
I've kind of been holding
on to something too.

35:58.909 --> 36:01.203
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:02.663 --> 36:03.664
I'm all ears.

36:26.478 --> 36:27.771
I want you to be proud of me.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.524
Dude, what?

36:31.316 --> 36:32.317
I am proud of you.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.736
Can I finish, please?

36:36.655 --> 36:37.656
I'm listening.

36:39.032 --> 36:40.617
I want you to be proud of me.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.331
And I know, in many ways,
I'm just like you.

36:46.331 --> 36:49.251
And just like you're like Granddad,
but different,

36:49.251 --> 36:51.295
I'm like you in many ways...

36:54.047 --> 36:55.048
but different.

37:01.763 --> 37:02.764
I'm gay.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.191
What are you talking about?

37:12.774 --> 37:14.484
I'm gay, Dad.

37:19.323 --> 37:20.741
How can you be gay?

37:21.325 --> 37:23.660
What about the vampire?

37:24.870 --> 37:26.121
I didn't even like her.

37:26.121 --> 37:29.625
I was trying to impress my friends.

37:31.043 --> 37:32.294
I was trying to impress you.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.130
How do you know?

37:37.090 --> 37:38.091
I just do.

37:39.593 --> 37:40.677
For how long?

37:42.638 --> 37:43.764
Couple years now.

37:52.356 --> 37:57.653
You know, son, if you not into gals at 15,

37:59.321 --> 38:01.281
you could just be a late bloomer.
I mean, this--

38:01.281 --> 38:03.116
this kind of thing, it happ--

38:17.714 --> 38:18.799
Son...

38:22.386 --> 38:23.637
I am proud of you.

38:27.641 --> 38:28.684
And I love you.

38:32.396 --> 38:33.480
And I wish...

38:37.067 --> 38:39.194
I wish my father could have seen...

38:41.321 --> 38:43.949
how an amazing young man you are.

38:50.414 --> 38:51.498
Thank you.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.635
Hi, Coach. Can you spare a few moments?

39:03.635 --> 39:04.803
Come on in.

39:05.387 --> 39:06.763
What do I owe the visit?

39:06.763 --> 39:10.017
I've thought a great deal about everything
your team has been through.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.395
All the trials and tribulations,
and all the distractions.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.814
And I wanna know how I can help.

39:16.773 --> 39:19.151
Help the team and you.

39:22.487 --> 39:23.697
What's your angle, Emory?

39:26.867 --> 39:28.410
I wanna be supportive.

39:29.578 --> 39:31.246
I'd like them to be able to focus.

39:33.248 --> 39:34.333
And you want to win.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.501
That too.

39:36.543 --> 39:37.544
What do you know?

39:39.671 --> 39:41.965
Your ass is on the line just like mine.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.847
You need to get behind Jace Carson.

39:50.516 --> 39:53.560
Call every college in your Rolodex

39:53.560 --> 39:56.688
and tell them that Jace Carson
is the Second Coming.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.525
You need to tell
the Puerto Rican National Team Committee

39:59.525 --> 40:03.529
that Nick Mendez is one of the best
all-around players you've ever seen.

40:03.529 --> 40:08.659
You need to tell the debate team to stop
scheduling competitions on game day.

40:09.785 --> 40:12.162
Now, Royale's never gonna play D1 ball,

40:12.162 --> 40:14.289
but school is supposed to
enrich their lives, right?

40:14.873 --> 40:17.125
- Absolutely.
- He's my best defender.

40:18.085 --> 40:21.046
I don't want to lose him,
and I don't want him to have to choose.

40:23.257 --> 40:24.258
I'll get into it.

40:25.968 --> 40:26.969
And Doc...

40:29.137 --> 40:32.432
if they lose, I hope we can still count
on your support.

40:32.432 --> 40:37.145
If we don't win,
my support may not hold much weight.

40:53.537 --> 40:54.538
Oh, my God.

40:55.497 --> 40:56.582
Wow.

40:57.875 --> 41:00.419
Oh, shi--

41:02.713 --> 41:03.881
Oh, shit. The door.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.090
Hi, Mom.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.009
Jace? You're home early.

41:07.009 --> 41:10.679
So are you.
Look, I'm gonna go to the store.

41:10.679 --> 41:12.472
I'll be right back.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.975
- Okay.
- And hi, Mekhi.

41:15.475 --> 41:16.602
Hi, Jace.

41:36.622 --> 41:38.832
Royale, how we doing with the debate team?

41:38.832 --> 41:40.959
Great, Coach.
Competition was moved earlier today.

41:40.959 --> 41:43.003
- Yeah? How'd y'all do?
- We killed it.

41:43.003 --> 41:44.838
- Hey, I love to hear that.
- Yes, sir.

41:46.798 --> 41:49.885
Drew. Schedule some time with me.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.094
I wanna talk college with you.

41:51.094 --> 41:53.222
- All right. That's a bet, Coach.
- All right.

41:58.727 --> 41:59.603
Hey, man.

42:01.188 --> 42:03.857
Appreciate you being here.
I know it's a tough time for you.

42:03.857 --> 42:05.275
Yeah. Thanks, Coach.

42:05.275 --> 42:07.444
Coach Meg says you wanna address the team.

42:07.444 --> 42:12.032
Yeah. Okay if my pops hangs in here
while I say a few words?

42:12.783 --> 42:13.784
Sure, of course.

42:16.995 --> 42:17.996
You all set?

42:21.875 --> 42:24.670
All right. Quiet down, everyone.
Give CJ the floor.

42:31.802 --> 42:32.886
Hey, guys.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.847
I have something I wanna tell you.

42:34.847 --> 42:36.974
Is this about your grandfather, CJ?

42:36.974 --> 42:38.851
We're all sorry to hear about that, man.

42:38.851 --> 42:40.727
- Sorry.
- Yeah, man. Sorry.

42:40.727 --> 42:41.812
Thanks.

42:42.729 --> 42:44.690
It's not about my grandfather.

42:48.652 --> 42:51.154
Then again, maybe it is.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.782
See, when my dad was a kid,

42:53.782 --> 42:57.494
my grandfather built him
this old rickety basketball hoop.

42:58.120 --> 43:00.539
That hoop helped my father
authentically find himself.

43:00.539 --> 43:05.878
And today, my father created a space
for me to authentically be who I am.

43:07.296 --> 43:09.173
And I feel like a weight has been lifted.

43:10.632 --> 43:13.427
Anyway, I want you all to know...

43:15.429 --> 43:16.430
I'm gay.

43:27.941 --> 43:30.402
Look, I didn't want this to be weird,
all right?

43:31.028 --> 43:33.488
I just thought I couldn't keep this
from y'all anymore.

43:33.488 --> 43:35.073
Y'all are my family.

43:35.073 --> 43:36.825
And don't worry,

43:36.825 --> 43:39.244
it's not like I have a crush
on any of you guys.

43:39.244 --> 43:40.579
That's messed up.

43:42.456 --> 43:44.416
Everyone has a crush on Jace Carson.

43:45.417 --> 43:46.877
Shut up.

43:47.878 --> 43:50.214
- Hey, CJ. It's all good, man.
- You good, bro.

43:50.214 --> 43:51.924
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah, we're here for you, man.

43:54.384 --> 43:56.553
- Hundred percent.
- No doubt.

43:57.179 --> 43:58.388
- Thanks, man.
- Yo, brothers.

43:59.431 --> 44:00.682
Hey. I'm proud of you, boy.

44:00.682 --> 44:01.767
I appreciate it.

44:02.809 --> 44:05.229
We got you. For real.

44:05.229 --> 44:06.980
Hey, good job, CJ.

44:07.481 --> 44:08.565
Thanks, Coach.

44:10.067 --> 44:11.151
Appreciate you, Coach.

44:12.027 --> 44:13.070
I appreciate you.

44:16.615 --> 44:17.991
I'll see you all out there.

44:18.575 --> 44:19.910
Everyone, have a great game.

44:20.494 --> 44:23.622
Yes, sir. Yeah. Yes, sir.

44:24.873 --> 44:26.917
All right. I need everyone to bring it in.

44:27.626 --> 44:33.173
This game either sends us home
or further in the playoffs.

44:33.173 --> 44:35.801
CJ, how about you take us out?

44:35.801 --> 44:37.469
All right. Let's go.

44:39.179 --> 44:41.473
Swagger on three. One, two, three.

44:41.473 --> 44:42.558
Swagger!

44:45.102 --> 44:46.937
Let's go, boys.

44:46.937 --> 44:48.564
Right here, Jace. Right here.

44:52.484 --> 44:53.569
Lap it down.

44:55.028 --> 44:56.238
Damn.

45:00.659 --> 45:02.035
7-1! 7-1!

45:02.703 --> 45:03.912
Head's up!

45:06.707 --> 45:10.043
Yeah! That's right!

45:17.551 --> 45:18.844
Let's go.

45:25.017 --> 45:26.185
Mus! Which way?

45:29.271 --> 45:30.272
Hey, Jace.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.863
Yes! Come on, baby! Yes!

45:44.244 --> 45:45.245
Where you going?

45:45.245 --> 45:46.455
I want that ball!

45:47.915 --> 45:48.957
Hey!

45:54.254 --> 45:55.797
CJ, in for Musa!

45:59.009 --> 46:00.928
<i>Substitution, Cedar Cove.</i>

46:00.928 --> 46:03.138
The game is way too close, all right?

46:23.200 --> 46:25.410
Breathe and tie your shoes.

46:32.751 --> 46:34.586
- CJ!
- Yo!

46:40.717 --> 46:42.678
<i>CJ Ryder!</i>

46:43.345 --> 46:44.513
Yes, CJ!

46:47.182 --> 46:48.934
CJ Ryder!

46:57.067 --> 46:58.068
Come on.

46:58.068 --> 47:00.863
<i>63-62, Cedar Cove down one.</i>

47:01.697 --> 47:02.948
Let's go, Carson. You got this.

47:09.329 --> 47:10.372
You got help?

47:12.666 --> 47:14.168
Shit, that's off. Left! Left!

47:15.127 --> 47:17.379
- Don't worry about that, 25!
- ...six, five,

47:17.379 --> 47:21.341
four, three, two, one!

47:24.970 --> 47:26.305
Yeah!

47:26.305 --> 47:28.348
<i>Final score, 63-64.</i>

47:28.348 --> 47:33.854
<i>Your winner, the Cedar Cove Mustangs!</i>

47:58.504 --> 47:59.546
Don't worry about it.

48:08.972 --> 48:12.226
Okay. Let's line it up.

48:12.226 --> 48:14.186
- Good game.
- Good game.

48:14.978 --> 48:16.271
Good game, bro.

48:16.271 --> 48:17.648
Good game.

48:18.690 --> 48:21.443
- We on the road to get that Natty!
- Yeah!

48:23.278 --> 48:24.488
Congratulations.

48:27.866 --> 48:28.784
Good job.

48:33.413 --> 48:35.040
Thank you, Coach Ike.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.667
I know you had something to do with it.

48:36.667 --> 48:38.710
The National Team says he's still
in the running.

48:39.837 --> 48:43.131
Oh, man, that's great news.

48:43.131 --> 48:44.842
I'm so happy for him.

48:44.842 --> 48:48.095
<i>...thank you for your support.
Put your hands together one more time</i>

48:48.095 --> 48:50.556
<i>for your Mustangs!</i>

48:50.556 --> 48:51.723
I'm gonna shower.

48:51.723 --> 48:53.141
Okay. Love you.

48:56.228 --> 48:57.229
Later.

49:23.922 --> 49:24.923
Thank you.

49:36.310 --> 49:37.352
We're still alive.

49:38.604 --> 49:39.730
I can see that.

49:41.106 --> 49:44.484
Listen, man, I was thinking
about the 22 and two thing.

49:45.485 --> 49:47.946
Thank you. I needed that reminder.

49:47.946 --> 49:50.282
And I'll be talking to Musa.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.118
You're welcome.

49:54.661 --> 49:56.246
And by the way, I quit.

50:00.876 --> 50:01.877
Hey.
