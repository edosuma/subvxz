00:02.127 --> 00:03.752
Previously on Smallville:

00:04.129 --> 00:05.878
There are aliens among us.

00:06.255 --> 00:08.881
If you don't stand with us,
you stand against us.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.510
It's time for you to pick a side.

00:14.012 --> 00:15.929
There's only one way
to leave Checkmate.

00:16.931 --> 00:20.017
I finished tracing the number
of our rogue Blur. It was Zod.

00:21.184 --> 00:24.061
You lied about having powers.
How'd you get them?

00:24.229 --> 00:25.271
From your blood.

00:26.773 --> 00:28.940
Your father left the Book of Rao
on this Earth.

00:29.108 --> 00:33.611
With all of this, there is no limit
to what we can achieve.

00:33.779 --> 00:36.780
Don't act like there isn't some agenda
you're not telling me.

00:36.948 --> 00:39.366
If it wasn't for Zod,
I wouldn't be alive today.

00:39.534 --> 00:41.952
Let's just say I know him
better than you think.

00:42.119 --> 00:45.455
A group of your people are looking
to a new leader. Clark.

00:45.622 --> 00:48.458
The time has come
to share in your birthright.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.083
I know what I have to do.

01:03.388 --> 01:06.598
Hey. Don't tell me you forgot
about your favorite customer.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.976
I thought you forgot about me.
You're late.

01:10.144 --> 01:11.894
I'll have the usual, please.

01:12.062 --> 01:13.729
All I got left is strong and burnt.

01:13.897 --> 01:15.230
As long as it's hot.

01:16.608 --> 01:18.233
You know, I've been meaning to ask.

01:18.609 --> 01:23.321
What kind of job has a pretty young lady
working all night, every night?

01:23.489 --> 01:26.198
Actually, I work
for a nonprofit organization.

01:26.365 --> 01:27.991
We help people in need.

01:28.451 --> 01:30.535
Trying to save the world, huh?

01:30.953 --> 01:32.329
All night, every night.

01:52.847 --> 01:53.847
Verify.

01:54.015 --> 01:58.267
Chloe Sullivan. Password: 051409.

01:59.937 --> 02:03.021
Vocal and bio analysis confirmed.

02:14.449 --> 02:17.408
Welcome to Watchtower, Miss Sullivan.

02:17.576 --> 02:20.203
Ready to save the world from itself?

02:40.304 --> 02:42.139
How did you find out my secret?

02:42.473 --> 02:47.560
Oliver's voice wavered when I told him
that Watchtower had been kidnapped.

02:48.228 --> 02:50.771
And I've seen the way he looks at you.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.817
It's the little things a girl tends to notice.

02:56.986 --> 02:59.404
And yet you somehow missed
an unloaded gun.

03:09.872 --> 03:11.873
Watchtower safety compromised.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.208
Initiating lockdown.

03:26.553 --> 03:29.554
It's in your best interest
to get these doors open, now.

03:37.270 --> 03:39.396
Security breach. Access denied.

03:41.357 --> 03:43.609
We're not going anywhere.

03:45.444 --> 03:47.195
Watchtower's in control now.

04:48.582 --> 04:50.749
I let myself in.

04:51.668 --> 04:55.837
Terrific. Did you, uh, hop up to the helipad
or just super-speed past security, Clark?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.006
- I used the elevator.
- How human of you.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.842
You're not on patrol tonight.
What's going on?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.177
I need to find Zod.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.223
You know Chloe?
She's got this big building...

05:08.391 --> 05:12.184
...filled with stuff I paid a lot of money for.
She could probably help you out.

05:12.352 --> 05:16.188
Last thing we need is to have a weapon
like Watchtower fall into the wrong hands.

05:16.356 --> 05:20.358
I wanna keep Chloe out of the line of fire.
I figured you'd agree with that.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.528
Keep Chloe out of the line of fire?
What's going on?

05:23.696 --> 05:25.196
Zod.

05:27.991 --> 05:31.368
He went after Lois. He pretended
to be the Blur and he put her in danger.

05:32.537 --> 05:34.328
It's time to take off the gloves.

05:34.496 --> 05:38.124
I need you. I can't have you starting a fight
if I'm trying to keep the peace.

05:38.292 --> 05:41.543
You like to see the goodness,
but you know what this guy's capable of.

05:41.711 --> 05:43.295
I know what you're capable of.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.548
I understand how you feel.

05:47.716 --> 05:49.883
Don't think I'm not angry too.

05:50.051 --> 05:53.887
I can't have you firing off the first shot,
threatening everything I've worked for.

05:54.055 --> 05:56.889
These are my people
that we're talking about.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.560
My first real chance to have
a Kryptonian family here on Earth.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.812
And we need to find Zod
and confront him. My way.

06:06.941 --> 06:10.026
- Yeah, all right, man, I got your back.
- Then suit up.

06:10.861 --> 06:12.778
Check the mansion.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.741
Before Tess went off the grid, she got close
to Zod. She may have left some intel.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.952
I have another lead
I wanna run down on my own.

06:23.747 --> 06:25.414
Hey, Clark.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.209
You know, those Kandorians...

06:30.711 --> 06:33.254
...they're not the only family
you have here.

06:45.932 --> 06:49.602
In the event that I die of starvation
or, oh, say, a ricocheting bullet...

06:49.770 --> 06:51.896
...do you mind telling me
how you got in here?

06:52.064 --> 06:53.730
You're sloppy, Chloe.

06:53.898 --> 06:57.776
I've got thousands of samples of your DNA
from all the times you've spied on me.

06:59.278 --> 07:01.612
It's called a DNA cloak.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.531
Well, aren't you fancy?

07:05.116 --> 07:08.409
You know, getting in doesn't really
seem to be our issue right now.

07:08.577 --> 07:10.203
How the hell do we get out of here?

07:10.371 --> 07:13.289
Short answer: it's impossible.
When Checkmate kidnapped me...

07:13.457 --> 07:16.958
...I upgraded Watchtower's security
to contain intruders like you.

07:17.126 --> 07:19.795
The only problem is
I was supposed to be on the outside.

07:23.757 --> 07:24.799
Seriously?

07:24.966 --> 07:28.761
The lockdown prevents any signals
from getting in or out.

07:30.596 --> 07:32.931
Threat confirmation still active.

07:33.099 --> 07:36.433
Wait a minute. Watchtower didn't react
because you attacked me.

07:36.601 --> 07:41.063
We're on lockdown because
some hacking transmitter was detected.

07:41.231 --> 07:44.482
Initial signal managed to pirate data
before my firewall blocked it.

07:44.650 --> 07:45.691
The thing is alive.

07:45.859 --> 07:49.112
It's trying to break through another firewall,
give away our location.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.446
- What did you bring in here?
- Nothing.

07:51.614 --> 07:55.409
I wanted to erase any info you had
on the Kandorians, not re-route it.

07:55.576 --> 07:59.412
I knew you were the Kandorians' lapdog,
but I didn't realize you were Zod's bitch.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.164
All right, look. If you're not behind this...

08:02.332 --> 08:06.543
...there's only one other group I can think of
that wants Watchtower this badly.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.011
The signal's scrambled. Watchtower threw
up some kind of halo of interference...

08:18.179 --> 08:20.346
...as soon as the tracker went live.

08:21.765 --> 08:23.808
Waller's coming online.

08:25.477 --> 08:28.061
We're trying to sort out the data
we siphoned...

08:28.229 --> 08:30.355
...before they blocked us.
What is your status?

08:34.484 --> 08:37.194
We've narrowed the location
within a 20-block radius.

08:37.362 --> 08:41.906
Good. We can't afford to make a mistake
with the Red Queen so close.

08:42.074 --> 08:45.368
Don't make me regret putting
my little white knight back in play.

08:45.536 --> 08:46.828
There's no need to worry.

08:46.996 --> 08:50.247
We're gonna have Watchtower
in Checkmate's hands by dawn.

08:52.041 --> 08:54.209
Godspeed, Agent Campbell.

08:54.377 --> 08:56.461
Waller out.

08:58.714 --> 09:00.756
You heard the Wall, gentlemen.

09:00.924 --> 09:05.010
Let's show Mercer how we feel
about a little thing called treason.

09:05.595 --> 09:08.305
Okay, if I was hiding
a transmitting tracking device...

09:08.473 --> 09:11.599
...I would wanna make it
as unassuming as possible.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.436
Which means
I can probably count this out.

09:15.604 --> 09:17.229
"Fever" colored lipstick? Really?

09:17.813 --> 09:21.733
Well, I was gonna go with plain Jane,
but you seem to have that market cornered.

09:21.901 --> 09:23.568
How much could have been leaked?

09:23.736 --> 09:27.237
Watchtower downloads what amounts to
the Library of Congress every 3 seconds.

09:27.405 --> 09:32.201
Which means in half that time, Checkmate
could have attained my entire database.

09:32.826 --> 09:35.870
And all of your files on the Kandorians.

09:38.248 --> 09:40.165
Firewall breach.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.834
Cluster 4458.

09:43.002 --> 09:45.545
If it wasn't planted in your things,
it must be on you.

09:45.713 --> 09:47.421
Firewall 3110.
- What?

09:47.589 --> 09:50.132
Chloe, this is ridiculous, okay?

09:51.510 --> 09:54.761
It's in your body, Tess.
Just beneath your skin.

09:57.681 --> 10:02.267
- Get it out of me, now.
Firewall 2081.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.816
Oh, my God.

10:12.069 --> 10:16.863
- It moved.
Firewall 1579.

10:17.031 --> 10:19.908
When it feels threatened,
it burrows deeper into the host.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.953
We'll never get it out now.

10:23.245 --> 10:24.745
How did you know that?

10:25.455 --> 10:26.872
It's a Checkmate device.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.292
A mechanical parasite powered
by the host's biorhythms.

10:30.459 --> 10:34.295
Firewall 1209.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.756
You know what they say:

10:38.216 --> 10:41.301
"You lie down with dogs,
you end up with fleas."

10:41.469 --> 10:45.054
Laugh it up, Chloe. But when Checkmate
finds us, we'll both be dead.

12:05.708 --> 12:09.210
I'm glad you've found a way
to preserve our culture here on Earth.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.755
I wish everyone saw it that way.

12:13.548 --> 12:16.884
Zod disappeared and took
the rest of our people with him.

12:17.135 --> 12:18.302
I don't understand.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.554
I thought all of you had found a new life
here on Earth.

12:21.805 --> 12:24.557
We were wrong to follow you, Kal-El.

12:25.100 --> 12:29.770
We did what you asked, tried to assimilate
with the humans, we were left behind.

12:31.481 --> 12:35.066
We're gathered here, waiting
for Zod's return, to ask his forgiveness.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.360
I'm sorry.
I never meant to divide our people.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.070
But you cannot realign with Zod.

12:39.237 --> 12:41.237
You've never trusted him, Kal-El.

12:41.405 --> 12:44.491
All Zod wanted was to give us powers
so we could protect ourselves.

12:44.659 --> 12:46.201
Zod already has powers.

12:47.995 --> 12:49.078
He's had them for weeks.

12:50.872 --> 12:52.873
Faora, there's something
you need to see.

13:14.267 --> 13:17.269
You are unmistakably
the one they call Green Arrow.

13:17.978 --> 13:19.938
A rebel with many causes.

13:21.065 --> 13:25.109
Glad to know my reputation
still proceeds me. You must be Zod.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.944
The soldier with no army.

13:27.112 --> 13:28.362
Hmm.

13:28.530 --> 13:31.115
I see my reputation precedes me too.

13:35.953 --> 13:39.454
Guessing by the looks of him,
we're not the only ones waiting for Tess.

13:40.289 --> 13:41.623
Oh, yeah, him.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.919
I find it disgusting how quickly you humans
can betray your own.

13:50.674 --> 13:55.635
Now, that one, he gave up all sorts
of useful information before he died.

13:55.803 --> 13:59.055
About something your government
called Checkmate.

14:00.015 --> 14:01.432
And about who they're after.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.145
Not long ago, a gift-wrapped me
was top of that wish list.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.980
And now Tess is.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.981
Checkmate is using her to get to us.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.274
Hunting us to the death.

14:13.402 --> 14:17.654
Having been on the receiving end
of their terrorist schemes...

14:17.822 --> 14:19.990
...why don't you join me...

14:20.158 --> 14:22.159
...against our common enemy?

14:23.827 --> 14:28.414
Well, I'm flattered, but if I let you go
after Checkmate, you'll start World War III.

14:28.832 --> 14:29.957
That's not an option.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.668
Your conviction is admirable...

14:34.837 --> 14:38.505
...but you can't possibly think
you're faster than me.

14:39.215 --> 14:42.676
I've always been taught
to favor accuracy over speed.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.868
Bull's-eye.

15:14.996 --> 15:17.706
Air supply terminated.

15:25.422 --> 15:28.507
Firewall 12.

15:29.383 --> 15:31.676
We got three minutes of air left.

15:31.844 --> 15:34.721
You think Checkmate will find us
before then?

15:34.972 --> 15:37.389
Asphyxiation or firing squad.

15:37.557 --> 15:39.892
Heh. Damned if we do,
damned if we don't.

15:40.060 --> 15:42.727
Firewall 11.

15:42.895 --> 15:43.978
Just damned.

15:49.401 --> 15:51.527
- I just wanted to save the world.
- Heh.

15:53.071 --> 15:54.822
That's funny.

15:55.406 --> 15:58.825
Last time I checked, you were just trying
to get rid of everyone in it.

15:59.952 --> 16:02.912
Firewall nine.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.288
Paint my ideals however you want...

16:05.456 --> 16:08.583
...but you and yours don't trust people
any more than I do.

16:10.586 --> 16:14.421
This entire building was programmed to
prevent anyone from getting close to you.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.220
Firewall seven.

16:24.348 --> 16:28.267
Yeah, I guess I lost my faith in people
a long time ago too.

16:29.769 --> 16:32.896
It's why you won't let Oliver
get close to you.

16:36.441 --> 16:39.402
And why I can't blame him
when he eventually leaves.

16:42.613 --> 16:44.948
He's not gonna leave you.

16:46.242 --> 16:48.784
With you, he has a purpose.

16:50.829 --> 16:52.705
I wish I could have given him that.

16:55.499 --> 16:58.626
- And it kills me.
Firewall three.

16:58.961 --> 17:01.963
Because you have everything
right in front of you...

17:02.589 --> 17:04.882
...and you can't even see it.

17:06.968 --> 17:09.636
Firewall two.

17:10.637 --> 17:13.264
Final breach imminent.

17:14.683 --> 17:16.475
They broke through the final firewall.

17:16.643 --> 17:18.810
Checkmate's gonna be here any minute.

17:20.438 --> 17:24.648
As long as they torture us with the a.c. on,
I'll die happy.

17:32.907 --> 17:34.532
Cold.

17:41.331 --> 17:46.084
Okay. Watchtower's cooling system uses
a special mix of liquid helium and nitrogen.

17:48.128 --> 17:49.754
Cold enough to shatter steel.

17:55.343 --> 17:57.427
What are you waiting for?

17:58.346 --> 18:02.014
If I pull these tanks,
then the mainframe melts.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.642
All my work. Watchtower is gone.

18:05.101 --> 18:07.977
If you don't, we die.

18:08.145 --> 18:10.772
Critical oxygen level.

18:15.902 --> 18:19.029
Warning. Temperature variation detected.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.865
Ready?

18:36.379 --> 18:38.963
System failure imminent.

18:40.715 --> 18:42.508
System failure imminent.

18:44.927 --> 18:47.720
System failure imminent.

18:49.264 --> 18:51.015
System failure imminent.

18:53.226 --> 18:56.770
System failure imminent.

18:56.938 --> 19:02.066
System failure imminent....

19:08.197 --> 19:10.031
They're back on the grid.

19:10.741 --> 19:12.283
Safeties off, gentlemen.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.535
Shoot to kill.

19:23.919 --> 19:25.586
Zod.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.630
He destroyed Krypton.

19:29.424 --> 19:32.342
My father sent those messages
here to Earth...

19:32.510 --> 19:35.761
...to help me stop history
from repeating itself.

19:38.098 --> 19:41.934
I trusted Zod too. That's why
I didn't tell you any of this sooner.

19:44.812 --> 19:48.189
Look, the circumstances may be different,
but Zod cannot be trusted.

19:49.025 --> 19:51.525
On Krypton, he destroyed the planet
to prove a point.

19:51.693 --> 19:53.861
We can't let him do the same thing here.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.288
I'd hoped what Zod had given me
would reunite our people.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.416
What he gave you?

20:09.584 --> 20:12.084
At the ceremony,
your sister was protecting you.

20:24.472 --> 20:25.555
You're pregnant.

20:28.892 --> 20:29.933
And Zod's the father?

20:34.563 --> 20:38.524
This baby is proof
that you can still have a life here...

20:38.942 --> 20:41.985
...apart from Zod. Without powers.

20:44.113 --> 20:45.822
Faora...

20:47.158 --> 20:48.949
...Krypton lives on through you.

21:00.711 --> 21:02.586
Why don't you just murder me now?

21:02.754 --> 21:04.505
Isn’t that what your race does?

21:06.132 --> 21:09.343
Sometimes.
And I would love to, believe me.

21:09.511 --> 21:12.887
But although inconvenient
and a lot less fun...

21:13.055 --> 21:14.514
...ow...

21:14.681 --> 21:17.891
...I made a commitment to Clark
to help save the world peacefully.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.436
Now, with that said,
if you bulldoze me again...

21:21.604 --> 21:23.480
...I might have a change of heart.

21:30.529 --> 21:33.196
Zod's been looking for something
ever since we arrived.

21:37.743 --> 21:38.867
The Book of Rao.

21:39.869 --> 21:43.163
Zod said the Book of Rao
was some sort of Kryptonian Bible.

21:43.331 --> 21:46.457
It's so much more than that.
It wields great power.

21:47.376 --> 21:50.169
And if Zod were to get his hands on it...

21:50.671 --> 21:52.296
...then who knows what he would do?

21:57.051 --> 21:58.468
Oliver, what's wrong?

21:58.636 --> 22:02.429
I found what we're looking for. I'll give you
a hint. He's bigger than a breadbox.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.849
- Zod?
Yep.

22:05.016 --> 22:06.058
I'll be right there.

22:06.643 --> 22:10.353
Well, you take your sweet time
because I have everything under...

22:12.064 --> 22:13.731
...control.

22:19.821 --> 22:21.238
Oliver?

22:21.406 --> 22:22.989
Oliver?

22:36.210 --> 22:37.710
No.

22:45.885 --> 22:47.594
Zod.

22:51.764 --> 22:54.224
- Change of plans, Agent Campbell.
Change of plans?

22:54.475 --> 22:56.435
We just made contact
with Mercer's tracker.

22:56.603 --> 22:59.770
I don't care about Mercer or Watchtower.
We decrypted the data.

22:59.938 --> 23:02.023
We found the aliens.

23:02.191 --> 23:05.151
Checkmate is going to stop this war
before it gets started.

23:05.319 --> 23:07.194
Waller out.

23:12.366 --> 23:15.868
We've got her 20.
Now lock her down, I'm not losing her.

23:16.036 --> 23:18.204
Sir, you heard Waller.
We have our orders.

23:18.371 --> 23:22.373
I just spent the last five months in recovery
from what Mercer did to me.

23:22.541 --> 23:26.461
Now, this op is over when I say it's over,
understood?

23:34.135 --> 23:36.260
I don't get it. You're in the clear.

23:36.428 --> 23:39.305
We escaped before Checkmate
got a hit on Watchtower's address.

23:39.473 --> 23:41.182
Doesn't make you less of a liability.

23:41.350 --> 23:45.143
You still know the secret identities
of all my most valuable players.

23:46.562 --> 23:48.772
There's no sense
in both of us getting captured.

23:50.815 --> 23:54.818
I'm not letting you out of my sight
until we get rid of your little friend.

24:01.909 --> 24:06.495
I know how much I'm asking of you
in standing against Zod.

24:07.705 --> 24:11.749
I will not let my child be raised
under a tyrant's rule.

24:12.251 --> 24:16.170
We cannot let our future be guided
by a tyrant's hand.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.341
Our past ended in war.

24:23.970 --> 24:26.095
Let our future begin with peace.

24:30.308 --> 24:32.101
There they are!

24:32.269 --> 24:33.351
You, go.

24:47.698 --> 24:50.366
- Enough.
You heard her.

24:50.617 --> 24:52.285
Enough's enough.

24:56.205 --> 24:57.497
The leader comes with me.

25:00.167 --> 25:01.835
We have a few things to discuss.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.305
Dispose of the rest.

25:21.519 --> 25:26.272
I'll have Dr. Hamilton check in with you
once we get him and assess the damage.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.024
Clark...

25:28.525 --> 25:30.401
...Checkmate's after the Kandorians.

25:30.944 --> 25:33.361
Only you can save your people.

25:43.246 --> 25:47.373
Please. Our people have done nothing.
Where are you taking us?

26:02.429 --> 26:04.430
- Vala, where's your sister?
- They took her.

26:20.904 --> 26:24.364
Atropine? What the hell
are you gonna do with that?

26:24.531 --> 26:27.241
There's no time. Look, if you're right...

26:27.409 --> 26:30.160
...and that transmitter is powered
by your biorhythms...

26:30.328 --> 26:34.122
...then the only way that I can turn it off
is to stop your heart.

26:34.290 --> 26:35.457
I have to kill you, Tess.

26:37.042 --> 26:39.627
And this is the only way
I'm gonna bring you back.

26:44.590 --> 26:47.801
You're asking for a pretty big
leap of faith here.

26:47.968 --> 26:49.803
You're gonna have to trust me.

27:18.286 --> 27:19.829
You ready?

27:25.084 --> 27:26.626
Do it.

27:44.976 --> 27:47.185
Signal just went dead.

27:50.772 --> 27:51.981
Let's move.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.156
Keep looking.

28:19.297 --> 28:20.714
Establish a perimeter.

28:20.882 --> 28:22.883
I want this whole area locked down.

28:46.613 --> 28:47.904
Son of a bitch.

29:21.768 --> 29:23.101
Whoa, whoa.

29:29.691 --> 29:32.108
I really... I really didn't think you'd do it.

29:32.944 --> 29:34.236
Bring me back.

29:34.403 --> 29:35.904
Neither did I.

29:47.623 --> 29:49.165
For the record, I saved your ass.

29:49.333 --> 29:52.834
You say anything about me or mine
to anyone...

29:53.002 --> 29:55.295
...next time you won't wake up.

29:55.797 --> 29:57.089
You understand?

29:58.883 --> 30:00.883
Guess you'll have to trust me.

30:22.987 --> 30:28.116
Our field offices were just leveled
by the one you call Zod.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.201
We knew nothing about this.
Zod is acting alone.

30:31.828 --> 30:33.996
We stand apart. We only want peace.

30:34.163 --> 30:36.247
Dozens of my agents are dead.

30:36.415 --> 30:37.999
We are way past peace.

30:39.585 --> 30:41.502
Then we will help you stop him.

30:41.670 --> 30:44.296
Defecting means betraying
your own kind.

30:45.172 --> 30:46.965
I'm only betraying one.

31:09.027 --> 31:11.945
Checkmate's actions demand justice.

31:12.113 --> 31:14.113
Murder isn't justice.

31:45.516 --> 31:48.518
Seems like a lifetime ago...

31:48.685 --> 31:50.811
...when I pulled you out of that rubble,
doesn't it?

31:50.979 --> 31:53.064
The Siege of Argo.

31:53.398 --> 31:54.857
There were many losses that day.

32:03.907 --> 32:05.699
Not for me...

32:06.451 --> 32:08.744
...because I found a young...

32:10.246 --> 32:13.581
...and beautiful cadet
who would become my trusted right hand.

32:16.418 --> 32:19.294
Oh, you were so brave
in the face of death.

32:19.462 --> 32:21.713
I knew then that you would be
a true partner.

32:25.384 --> 32:27.510
I've trusted you...

32:28.220 --> 32:29.929
...for so very long.

32:32.140 --> 32:34.391
Depended on you...

32:36.435 --> 32:38.812
...across time and space.

32:42.148 --> 32:45.484
But in your eyes, I just see contempt.

32:46.319 --> 32:48.611
I see betrayal.

32:56.828 --> 33:00.288
Now, why would you turn your back
on me?

33:01.832 --> 33:03.416
I shared my bed with you.

33:03.583 --> 33:06.293
I didn't turn my back on you.

33:07.003 --> 33:08.462
You turned your back on us...

33:08.629 --> 33:12.424
...when our only crime was trying to forge
a life for ourselves on this planet.

33:14.385 --> 33:18.971
If I ever learned that insurrection
had spread across my ranks...

33:19.139 --> 33:23.307
...if I had ever discovered that my men
had aligned themselves against me...

33:23.475 --> 33:25.560
...I would raze this planet.

33:25.728 --> 33:27.812
I would burn it to the ground...

33:27.980 --> 33:31.940
...until the last ember went cold
beneath my boot.

33:34.652 --> 33:39.655
Now only I will lead us to the next age.

33:39.823 --> 33:42.491
All will follow Zod.

33:44.994 --> 33:47.454
You already sacrificed one world
for your ego.

33:50.666 --> 33:53.333
You know nothing of sacrifice.

34:01.842 --> 34:04.594
I know more than you ever will.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.935
Kneel.

34:14.478 --> 34:16.020
Never.

36:01.279 --> 36:03.362
I found a way to prioritize our satellites...

36:03.530 --> 36:06.782
...to get a location on Mercer
once she left the hospital.

36:07.492 --> 36:11.661
Zod destroyed the Metropolis field office
and six more went dark.

36:11.829 --> 36:13.955
The Black King is still missing.
We're at war.

36:14.123 --> 36:17.250
Contact the U.N. We have to regroup
before they strike again.

36:34.181 --> 36:35.640
Run.

37:20.555 --> 37:24.474
Tell me you found that Z-branding bastard
so we can slap him across the universe.

37:24.642 --> 37:28.353
Zod's on the move. And there's no sign
of Faora or the Kandorians.

37:29.188 --> 37:32.189
Maybe if I can reach the others,
I can talk some sense into them.

37:33.107 --> 37:34.524
We may be too late for that.

37:34.776 --> 37:35.817
That's the Castle.

37:36.945 --> 37:38.444
God.

37:38.612 --> 37:40.363
Zod's attacked Checkmate.

37:43.659 --> 37:45.617
Oliver was personal.

37:45.785 --> 37:48.036
With this, Zod just declared war.

37:51.957 --> 37:54.750
You're not gonna like
where he's gathering his troops.

37:55.543 --> 37:59.837
My eye in the sky above the Fortress
is picking up movement.

38:36.912 --> 38:40.790
What was to be the first son
of Kandor is no more.

38:42.209 --> 38:45.836
Now we, the last sons
and daughters of Krypton...

38:46.004 --> 38:48.964
...have no choice
but to preserve our birthright.

39:04.186 --> 39:07.938
The humans killed the mother
of my unborn child...

39:09.983 --> 39:12.567
...the mother of your future.

39:12.735 --> 39:14.402
That's a lie.

39:26.496 --> 39:29.999
The last time that I saw Faora,
she was alive.

39:32.294 --> 39:34.169
And she was alone...

39:34.336 --> 39:36.087
...with Zod.

39:38.007 --> 39:40.300
Why should they believe you?

39:42.385 --> 39:44.303
And this traitor...

39:44.471 --> 39:48.890
...saved the life of the woman
who held you hostage.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.477
The woman who wanted to dissect you.

39:52.811 --> 39:55.395
Who wanted to torture you.

39:55.772 --> 39:57.981
Murder you.

39:59.609 --> 40:04.070
Vala, if there's anyone who really knows
what your sister wanted, it's you.

40:06.656 --> 40:09.492
It was peace, Vala. She wanted peace.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.286
No.

40:13.454 --> 40:14.829
Zod's right.

40:16.624 --> 40:19.666
The humans will never allow Kandor
peace.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.130
They will hunt us to the last man...

40:27.341 --> 40:28.466
...but they will fail...

40:29.843 --> 40:32.844
...for we shall never be defeated.

40:34.806 --> 40:37.432
We will follow General Zod
to the ends of this Earth.

40:48.692 --> 40:51.194
Krypton will rise again.

40:53.114 --> 40:56.865
And all humankind will kneel before Zod.

40:57.033 --> 40:58.534
I'll never let that happen.

41:11.963 --> 41:14.506
You won't be able to stop us.
