WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:07.430
Captain's log, stardate 43489.2.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.551
We have arrived at Angosia III,

00:09.680 --> 00:11.830
a planet
that has expressed a desire

00:11.960 --> 00:13.916
for membership in the Federation.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.158
Prime Minister Nayrok has taken
us on a tour of the capital city.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.238
I'm very impressed
with everything I've seen.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.238
I hope it will reflect favourably
in your report.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.114
Your recovery from the Tarsian
War is a tribute to your people.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.558
It is, indeed.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.954
We are not warriors.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.198
Reason should settle disputes,
but not all cultures agree with us.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.151
An unfortunate reality.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.431
Development of the mind,
cultivation of the intellect...

00:43.560 --> 00:47.712
These have been Angosian
pursuits for centuries.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.153
Prime Minister, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but we have a problem.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.909
- May I see you for a moment?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.835
Yes, what is it?

01:01.560 --> 01:05.633
They'll make a fine addition
to the Federation.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.799
I'm not sure I'd like to live here.
A bit stuffy for my taste.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.595
A prisoner has escaped
from the penal colony on Lunar V.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.633
Two guards are dead. The prisoner
has taken a transport vessel.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.991
- Can you pursue him?
- Our station's been sabotaged.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.917
The entire base is in chaos.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.076
We have ships following him,

01:30.200 --> 01:33.988
but our civilian pilots
are not trained for this.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.429
With your permission?

01:38.760 --> 01:42.070
Data, a stolen transport vessel's
departed from Lunar V.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.636
- Did you pick it up on the sensors?
- Yes, Commander.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.877
Good. Quarantine the pilot.
Is he armed?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.790
Yes. And dangerous. Lunar V
is a maximum-security facility.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.275
- Did you read that, Data?
- Yes, sir.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.837
- We will use extreme caution.
- Keep us informed. Riker out.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.757
On screen, sir.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.556
- Specifications on the vessel?
- No warp drive.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.872
- Minimal weaponry.
- Heading, Mr. Crusher?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.117
31 9 mark 250, sir.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.834
Vessel speed increasing to .02
impulse. He's seen us, Data.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.520 --> 02:34.671
- That's the ship's drive section.
- Where's the rest of it?

02:34.800 --> 02:39.112
- Scan for life form readings.
- None.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.873
Bring us around
to the back of the asteroid.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.314
Sensors show wreckage
on the surface.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.434
- No life-signs.
- Apparently he did not survive.

02:57.560 --> 03:01.189
Data, the drive section...
Where did it go?

03:02.720 --> 03:06.190
There's no sign of it.
Someone must be at the helm.

03:06.320 --> 03:11.917
- Status report, Mr. Data.
- The prisoner has eluded us, sir.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.354
Eluded the Enterprise?

03:43.920 --> 03:47.708
Space, the final frontier.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.710
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.996
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:57.600 --> 04:01.309
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:02.080 --> 04:06.358
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.035
We followed procedures precisely.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.277
Scanners showed no life forms
in the drive section.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.436
I cannot explain how he escaped.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.757
- Incoming message from Angosia.
- On screen.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.591
We've identified the prisoner.
His name is Roga Danar.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.790
He has a long criminal record,

05:25.920 --> 05:30.277
and is given to bouts of
uncontrollable violence.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.234
I appreciate your warning.
We will keep you informed.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.874
How fast
can that transport ship travel?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.992
Without warp drive,
it wouldn't be out of our range.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.596
There's nothing within sensor range.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.838
- Cloaking device?
- Not an Angosian capability.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.190
- Unless he's borrowing one.
- Huh?

05:53.320 --> 05:56.949
Hanging over the planet's pole
would confuse our sensors.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.919
Commander,
I can recalibrate our sensors

06:02.040 --> 06:05.350
to read through magnetic interference
over the poles.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.598
- We'll try. Realign for polar orbit.
- Aye, sir.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.314
- There he is. You were correct.
- He knows all the tricks.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.590
Still no life-form readings.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.998
- Could it be magnetic interference?
- No, I have compensated.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.317
We'll have an answer shortly.
Lock on a tractor beam.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.000
Tractor beam locking on, sir.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.473
- He is coming about.
- He's out of his mind.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.558
Massive power build-up
in his thrusters.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.716
On main viewer.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.830
He's making a suicide run.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.430
Shields activated, beam disengaged.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.793
- He bounced off the shields!
- An interesting twist.

07:04.160 --> 07:09.792
Fix coordinates onto that vessel.
We'll beam it into a shuttle bay.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.357
That will not be necessary. He is
no longer in the drive section.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.109
What?

07:16.240 --> 07:20.028
I anticipated that diversionary
tactic from his pattern to date.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.869
We are picking up a cylindrical
object, seven metres in length

07:24.000 --> 07:27.072
- and three metres in diameter.
- On screen.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.189
Magnify.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.992
- An escape pod!
- This guy's incredible!

07:35.120 --> 07:37.873
Yet still no life-form readings.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.629
Prepare to beam aboard
from inside that shuttle

07:41.760 --> 07:44.593
anything large enough
to be a humanoid adult.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.675
Aye, sir.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.110
Security team,
report to transporter room four.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.434
On our way.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.314
Contents in stasis,
pending the arrival of security.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.637
An illicit weapon has been detected
in the transporter beam.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.751
It's been rendered inoperable.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.155
Worf, let's greet our guest.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.559
Bring him in, Mr. O'Brien.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.468
Stay where you are!

08:20.040 --> 08:22.190
More security, transporter room four!

08:22.520 --> 08:25.239
More security! More security!

09:17.400 --> 09:19.231
Get him to a detention cell.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.191
Set phasers on maximum stun.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.435
Commander...

09:35.920 --> 09:39.629
We'll need time to get
our containment field operational

09:39.760 --> 09:41.239
before we pick him up.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.750
The damage he did during his escape
was considerable.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.440
- We'll await your signal.
- We're grateful.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.758
The prison psychologist suggests
that you keep Danar fully sedated

09:51.880 --> 09:53.677
until he's ready for transport.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.031
He's in our highest security
detention area.

09:58.160 --> 10:02.950
- There shouldn't be any problems.
- Do not relax security at all.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.231
He is extremely violent
and very cunning.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.070
I will send a transport vessel
to pick him up. Nayrok out.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.270
Have you run a diagnostic
on the sensors?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.994
There is nothing wrong
with the ship's sensors.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.998
The reason
we did not pick up life signs

10:19.120 --> 10:22.317
is because the prisoner
has no life signs.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.590
Computer, identify the occupant
of the detention cell.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.314
The detention cell
is vacant at this time.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.799
- He's in there.
- Is he an android?

10:32.920 --> 10:36.117
Our sensors can identify
artificial life forms.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.835
Apparently, he's capable
of deceiving the sensors.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.310
Are you alright?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.236
What is this ship?

11:30.480 --> 11:32.391
You're on the USS Enterprise.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.353
- A war vessel?
- A Federation starship.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.398
Federation!

11:42.400 --> 11:46.678
We were orbiting Angosia
when you escaped from Lunar V.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.594
It seems that I'm a victim
of my own bad timing.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.756
Are you the keeper of this jail?

12:11.720 --> 12:16.555
- I'm Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor.
- Counsellor?

12:16.680 --> 12:21.356
Too bad. I'd rather you were
my jailer on my return trip.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.757
I assume we are returning to Lunar V.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.119
That terrifies you.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.798
I killed three men
to get out of there.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.310
I'm fully capable
of killing you as well.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.957
That's a terrifying thought,
isn't it? Even to me.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.678
Do they mistreat you there?

12:46.320 --> 12:50.598
Not at all. I'm comfortable,
well-fed and housed.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.314
The Angosians take good care
of prisoners.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.477
It's simply a matter
of never being able to leave.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.996
What about you, Counsellor?

13:01.720 --> 13:05.918
You always visit prisoners? Are you
a specialist in criminal behaviour?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.273
Or am I just
an interesting specimen,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.437
an insect to be studied
under your microscope?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.515
Why all this anger toward me?

13:18.240 --> 13:23.598
A girl with long, dark hair
broke my heart a long time ago.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.554
Out of bitterness and resentment...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.435
..l turned to crime.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.390
How about this one?

13:37.520 --> 13:40.478
My mother abandoned me
when I was little.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.558
I never got the guidance
that I needed.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.990
- Why are you doing this?
- Playing games?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.395
Isn't that what you do, Counsellor?

13:49.520 --> 13:52.478
Isn't that what
mind-control experts do?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.353
I am not a mind-control expert.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.994
I'm here because I sensed
you were in pain.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.430
And what do you sense now?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.999
The pain is gone.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.553
It's interesting, isn't it?

14:11.640 --> 14:15.519
There's a duality about the man.
It's hard to describe.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.471
He's aware of his crimes.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.160
- They trouble him deeply.
- Counsellor...

14:20.280 --> 14:23.909
He's intelligent, thoughtful,
typically Angosian.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.351
I know what he's done.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.429
But when I'm with him, I can't
believe he is deliberately violent.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.599
In fact, inherently, he has
a non-violent personality.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.632
It took five men to restrain him!

14:39.760 --> 14:42.149
And he damaged the transporter room.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.078
I'm not opening the door for him,
Captain.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.638
I can only tell you that I sense
something unusual about him.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.309
Something that is not inherent
to a criminal personality.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.672
In a few hours I'm giving him
to the Angosians. And I'm happy to.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.435
I understand.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.631
Data, do we have a link-up
with the Angosian central computer?

15:16.760 --> 15:19.991
Yes. We are copying records
for Federation inspection,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.315
pursuant to their application.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.796
Can I see a police record
on Roga Danar?

15:29.800 --> 15:33.759
- There is no record.
- Impossible. He's been in prison.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.519
Lunar V is a military prison.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.317
Military? He's a soldier?

15:41.560 --> 15:45.838
That may explain his tactics
when we tried to capture him.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.990
It doesn't say here
what he was arrested for.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.918
Call up his military record.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.672
He served in many campaigns
during the Tarsian War.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.519
Received two promotions
to the rank of subhadar.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.392
An honourable tour of duty.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.513
What was this man's crime?

16:22.200 --> 16:26.318
- I've learned you are a soldier.
- I was a soldier.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.438
- Why were you in prison?
- Because I'm a threat to society.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.950
There's no police record.
What did you do?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.076
Everything they asked me to do.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.352
- That's why I became such a threat.
- I don't understand.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.519
- Why are you bothering to try?
- Because I want to help.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.639
Unlock the door.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.115
You are a non-violent man.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.438
Yet you committed acts
of excessive violence.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.788
You can learn to do it
if you have to.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.357
- Did you have to?
- It was war.

17:05.480 --> 17:10.156
- So, it started with the war?
- It started the day I volunteered.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.319
The day I began training.
The day I met my first instructor.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.590
And he also called himself
a counsellor.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.993
Roga Danar
was an idealistic young man

17:30.120 --> 17:32.793
who answered
his people's call to service.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.754
He joined the military to fight
for the Angosian way of life.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.269
He didn't realize that by doing so

17:39.400 --> 17:43.678
he'd have to give up that way of life
for ever. He's not the same man

17:43.800 --> 17:45.313
who left home to go to war.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.671
He's been through intense
psychological manipulation

17:48.800 --> 17:51.598
and biochemical modifications.

17:51.720 --> 17:56.271
I examined him. His cell structure
has been significantly altered.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.870
They used a combination of
cryptobiolin, triclenidil

18:00.000 --> 18:02.150
and a few things
I can't recognize.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.475
Was he a prisoner of war?
Who did this to him?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.830
His own government.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.872
He's been programmed
to be the perfect soldier.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.513
He can be normal,

18:11.640 --> 18:16.668
but when danger is perceived,
the programming takes over.

18:16.800 --> 18:22.113
Memory, strength, intelligence,
reflexes, all become enhanced.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.959
He's conditioned
to survive at any cost.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.878
A novel substance
in his cellular structure

18:28.000 --> 18:30.912
even shields electrical impulses.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.634
Perhaps that is why
our sensors did not detect him.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.156
Why was he assigned
to the Lunar V facility?

18:38.280 --> 18:43.035
He committed no crime. He says he was
ordered there with others like him.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.709
When the first soldiers returned
to Angosia, they had trouble.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.358
The rules changed too quickly.
A lost temper could result in murder.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.916
Counsellor, did no one attempt
to adjust their programming?

18:57.200 --> 19:00.192
They were just exiled to Lunar V.

19:00.320 --> 19:04.677
Lunar V, an orbiting gulag.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.315
What do you want?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.151
- Am I disturbing you?
- Yes.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.510
- Then I will leave.
- No, wait!

19:21.200 --> 19:23.794
I'd rather talk to someone.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.675
- Why do you have yellow eyes?
- I am an android.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.678
- We have something in common.
- We do?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.439
Yes. We have both
been programmed.

19:36.320 --> 19:40.472
Ah, yes, you've been talking
to Counsellor Troi.

19:40.600 --> 19:45.196
- It's not at all the same, android.
- I am not belittling your condition.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.233
I understand your dilemma.
But I am curious.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.477
My program can be altered.
Yours cannot?

19:54.200 --> 19:57.397
The man I was is still inside me,
but this...

19:57.520 --> 20:00.398
this conditioning has been imposed.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.672
Woven together with my thoughts,
feelings and responses.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.870
How do you separate program and man?

20:08.120 --> 20:13.274
Without further analysis from Troi
or Dr Crusher, I cannot say.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.552
- But I believe it is possible.
- Yeah, doctors!

20:17.680 --> 20:24.074
Angosian doctors did this. If they
could, wouldn't they have undone it?

20:25.360 --> 20:26.998
I cannot answer that.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.359
Nor can l.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.511
Yet I ask myself that question
every moment of every day.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.231
He's been telling you half-truths.
He's a prisoner.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.070
- What do you expect him to say?
- Please clarify it for me.

20:46.200 --> 20:50.716
The soldiers were resettled on
Lunar V. It was to be their colony.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.479
Was it a resettlement
of their choosing?

20:53.600 --> 20:57.115
It was for their own and others'
protection. Most were happy.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.152
We did everything to give them
a fine quality of life.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.399
Even the most comfortable
prison is still a prison.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.559
A few agitators like Danar
forced us to add security.

21:10.960 --> 21:15.476
My medical team suggests that there
may be alternative treatment.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.354
Captain, every alternative
has been explored.

21:19.480 --> 21:24.600
We are now discussing internal
security, which is not your concern.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.555
I've dispatched a ship to transport
the prisoner back to Lunar V.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.193
On behalf of Angosia,

21:31.320 --> 21:35.632
I thank the Federation for its
assistance in retrieving our citizen.

21:39.760 --> 21:46.552
"Matter of internal security."
The age-old cry of the oppressor.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.911
- Were you built for combat, android?
- No.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.634
But my program
includes military strategy.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.753
That was how I anticipated
your final tactic and captured you.

21:56.880 --> 22:01.078
You did that? Perhaps you're better
at combat than you think.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.316
Except I am not programmed to kill.

22:05.760 --> 22:10.038
My improved reflexes
have allowed me to kill 84 times.

22:10.160 --> 22:15.792
My improved memory lets me remember
each of those 84 faces.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.875
- Do you know how that feels?
- I am incapable of any feeling.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.278
Then I envy you.

22:31.080 --> 22:35.631
- Roga, this is Capt Picard.
- Captain.

22:35.760 --> 22:40.914
Mr. Danar, I'm transferring you to
Angosian security. They're en route.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.875
I wanted to tell you I have no
choice. The Prime Minister insisted.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.797
We have no right to refuse.

22:47.920 --> 22:53.153
You would be foolish to consider
it otherwise, for they are correct.

22:53.280 --> 22:58.638
I am dangerous. There is no place
for me in a "civilized" society.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.354
- I do not believe that.
- Nor do l.

23:03.400 --> 23:07.109
I respect my officers' judgments.
I wish I could help further.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.870
- If a way appears, I will.
- I appreciate you telling me that.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.718
You deserve that much.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.469
You deserve to know I must use
whatever means I can to escape.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.998
Captain, the Angosian
transport vessel has arrived.

23:23.120 --> 23:26.874
Inform them the transfer
will take place shortly. Picard out.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.633
Mr. Data, to the bridge, please.

23:31.480 --> 23:36.031
Take care of yourself, android.
I enjoyed our talk.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.438
I, too.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.192
Perhaps when this planet
joins the Federation...

23:47.320 --> 23:50.710
I will not be there to see it,
Counsellor.

23:50.840 --> 23:56.756
Even with this demand to survive
they've built into my soul,

23:56.880 --> 24:00.509
I would rather die
than return to Lunar V.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.030
We're ready to receive the prisoner.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.515
Transmitting coordinates
of the holding cell.

24:21.320 --> 24:25.279
- Coordinates received.
- Stand by for transport. Picard out.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.515
Have security precautions
been taken?

24:29.640 --> 24:34.316
Between release of the force field
and activation of the transporter

24:34.440 --> 24:36.829
there will only be a .1 second gap.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.349
Even Danar can't move that fast.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.119
There will be
a full security contingent present.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.673
Proceed.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.037
Transporter room one to Lt Worf.
We're ready, sir.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.230
Energizing.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.194
Increase transporter...

25:09.840 --> 25:10.795
I'm losing him.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.396
Don't! You'll be killed.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.158
What the hell...?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.037
Security personnel, shut down
shuttle bays, transporters

25:35.160 --> 25:35.990
and turbo lifts.

25:36.120 --> 25:40.159
Captain, a phaser is missing.
We must assume he is armed.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.919
Sound general quarters. Clear all
corridors of non-essential personnel.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.350
- We don't want him taking hostages.
- General quarters sounded.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.632
Raise security containment fields
immediately on decks 34, 35 and 36.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.911
- Aye, sir.
- Put the turbo lifts back on.

25:58.040 --> 26:02.238
He may use them.
As soon as he does, we have him.

26:30.960 --> 26:34.873
Sir, unauthorized access of
turbo lift five on deck 34.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.558
- He took the bait.
- Override destination.

26:38.680 --> 26:43.037
Divert that turbo lift to a position
near to Lt Worf.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.432
Four seconds to arrival.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.195
We're in position.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.232
Phaser on overload. Seal this deck.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.869
Captain,
the overload has been averted.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.154
Drop force field on deck 36.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.399
Sir, containment field
down on deck 36.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.149
- How did he do that?
- He's headed for Engineering.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.510
Riker to La Forge!

27:43.160 --> 27:44.593
Engineering, respond!

27:45.480 --> 27:46.879
Engineering!

27:47.120 --> 27:48.872
Engineering, come in!

27:49.960 --> 27:52.633
Geordi, are you OK?

28:01.080 --> 28:05.676
Captain, someone in Engineering
is overriding the security lockout.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.360
Riker to Worf,
he's in Engineering.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.153
Acknowledged, Commander.
We're on our way.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.316
Data, stall Danar.
Allow him to think he's succeeding.

28:16.120 --> 28:20.033
As he bypasses each subsystem,
I can reroute it.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.832
Make it so.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.909
Danar is extremely adept, sir.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.793
I am not sure which security measure
he is circumventing.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.233
Sir, Danar has succeeded in
restoring power to shuttle bay two.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.435
I have overwritten Dana’s bypass.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.835
Shuttle bay two
is once again inactive.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.999
Very good, Mr. Data.
Now we know where he's headed.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.317
- You OK?
- Geordi!

29:28.800 --> 29:30.756
I'm alright.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.430
He took us by surprise.

29:33.560 --> 29:37.599
He came out of nowhere!
No one moves that fast!

29:37.720 --> 29:42.350
Lieutenant, I am reading
an open panel. K- 12, J-9, deck 30.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.595
Acknowledged.

29:43.720 --> 29:47.713
Danar must have climbed up
and gotten into a Jefferies tube.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.558
He could be anywhere.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.069
He's aiming for shuttle bay two.

29:52.200 --> 29:56.273
25 decks up. Quite a climb.
I wouldn't put it past him.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.155
- Full security at all shuttle bays.
- You want my advice?

30:01.280 --> 30:02.349
Double it!

30:13.480 --> 30:15.835
Captain, reading
another open access panel.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.597
Security
to Jefferies tube J-4, deck 1 5.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.835
Acknowledged.

30:28.320 --> 30:31.676
Deck 1 5, a few decks
below the shuttle bay.

30:31.800 --> 30:36.430
I find it unlikely Danar
is trying to reach shuttle bay two.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.515
Explain.

30:37.640 --> 30:41.394
In our previous encounter, Danar
employed a strategy of misdirection

30:41.520 --> 30:43.112
to gain his objective.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.913
You think he's using
that tactic now?

30:46.040 --> 30:50.909
He is aware our sensors cannot track
him, yet he leaves a trail.

30:51.520 --> 30:56.958
- Where do you think he's headed?
- His true destination is a mystery.

31:04.680 --> 31:09.834
Readings indicate an open access
panel in Jeffries tube N-1 1 , deck 38.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.589
- He's doubled back on us.
- The cargo bays.

31:13.840 --> 31:18.072
- Everyone out of the cargo bays.
- Aye, sir.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.431
- Status, Data?
- They appear to be empty.

31:37.560 --> 31:41.633
Good. I want you
to flood them with anesthizine.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.352
Aye, sir.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.749
Sensors show anesthizine
concentration 70 parts per million

32:06.880 --> 32:08.393
within the cargo bays.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.192
That'll put him to sleep!

32:10.320 --> 32:13.073
Return environmental conditions
to normal, Mr. Data.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.709
- Move in your security teams, Worf.
- Acknowledged.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.476
Worf to bridge.
No sign of the intruder

32:52.600 --> 32:55.831
but there's a missing pressure suit.

32:55.960 --> 32:56.949
Pressure suit?

32:57.080 --> 33:01.915
Could be he's planning to enter
shuttle bay two from the outside.

33:02.040 --> 33:07.194
Post security guards at all emergency
airlocks on decks 37 through 39.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.878
Aye, sir.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.196
I'll cover
the photon torpedo launchers.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.632
Danar may attempt to leave the ship
that way. Worf out.

33:32.040 --> 33:37.068
Danar! You are cunning.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.434
You must have Klingon blood.
But the battle is over.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.276
My battle is never over.

33:47.480 --> 33:50.438
Worf to Bridge. I have Danar.

34:01.800 --> 34:06.715
Explosion in Jefferies tube, section
T-95. All sensors inoperative.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.239
Go to backup systems.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.918
Unable to transfer control, sir.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.471
Sit down, gentlemen.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.229
Worf to bridge.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.715
- Go ahead.
- Danar has escaped.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.673
His phaser powered
the cargo transporter.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.349
Coordinates indicate he beamed
aboard the Angosian ship.

35:25.080 --> 35:29.232
- Data, can you verify that?
- Negative, sir.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.669
External sensors
still non-functioning.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.800
- Then we can't track him.
- That was his plan all along.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.351
First Officer's log.
Supplemental.

35:47.480 --> 35:52.474
We continue to repair the ship's
sensors since the escape of Danar.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.397
He is still at large.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.988
I'm getting readings. Are we back up?

35:57.120 --> 36:00.635
- That's affirmative.
- Worf, sweep the area.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.832
Captain, the Prime Minister
is hailing us. Priority one.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.032
On screen.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.192
- Priority channel cleared.
- Yes, Prime Minister?

36:10.320 --> 36:13.278
I’ve just been informed
Danar has attacked

36:13.400 --> 36:15.470
the penal colony on Lunar V.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.989
- Attacked it?
- In our own police shuttle.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.556
People have been wounded.
Hundreds of prisoners are rioting.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.468
Some escaped with Danar
and are heading towards the capital.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.794
Captain, we are not suited
to handle situations like this.

36:29.920 --> 36:34.277
- That's what we created them for.
- I'll send an away team.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.231
Picard out.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.436
Troi, Data, Worf, you will accompany
me to the planet.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.996
These men are programmed to survive.
Is that correct?

36:56.120 --> 36:57.109
Yes, Captain.

36:57.240 --> 37:00.596
And they won't kill unless
their survival is at stake?

37:00.720 --> 37:03.518
It is against their nature to do so.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.633
Let's hope they do not believe
their survival is at stake.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.518
Mr. Worf,...

37:14.640 --> 37:17.393
you are responsible
for the Captain's safety.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.511
I understand, Commander.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.670
I doubt they'll listen to reason.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.952
I loathe the idea of violence,
but we must be prepared.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.671
This is all?
Where are your security men?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.791
We're not here to fight your wars.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.230
They're moving towards the city
centre. People are scared.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.237
Captain, they are dangerous.

37:56.360 --> 38:00.114
You're dangerous. They're only
victims. You made them what they are.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.516
They defended your way of life.
Then you discarded them.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.518
- They were not happy here.
- They were not welcome.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.392
The people wished them resettled.

38:08.520 --> 38:13.310
No one was pleased, but we had
to act for the greater good.

38:13.440 --> 38:17.399
If you have the skills
to create a master soldier,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.317
can't you counteract the effect?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.594
The chemicals can be removed,

38:22.720 --> 38:27.032
but we don't think the psychological
conditioning can be reversed.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.911
- Have you tried?
- We studied it thoroughly.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.595
Before training began,
we knew there'd be problems.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.233
It was a risk.

38:36.360 --> 38:39.158
Did you reveal that risk to the men?

38:39.280 --> 38:42.431
We were helping them
to survive the war.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.710
They needed those skills.

38:44.840 --> 38:48.674
Your brothers, sons.
You turned your backs on them.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.756
There are methods of treatment.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.156
Until you try,
how do you know they won't work?

38:55.280 --> 38:57.874
A partial recovery
could give them some peace.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.197
- It was the will of the people!
- To allow them to suffer?!

39:02.520 --> 39:06.832
There was a referendum. The people
weighed the costs involved.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.791
They chose the settlement solution.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.753
Besides, we may need them
again some day.

39:11.880 --> 39:16.237
- Have you understood what...?
- Freeze! Nobody move!

39:19.120 --> 39:22.078
No, Worf! All of you!

39:22.240 --> 39:24.549
Don't respond.
Don't provoke them further.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.433
Keep all weapons down
unless you wish to be killed.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.952
- Do as he says.
- No! Don't. Shoot us.

39:36.600 --> 39:41.720
Destroy us. Do what you have to.
But you will not ignore us.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.632
Go on, do it!

39:57.720 --> 39:58.675
Cowards!

39:58.800 --> 40:02.190
Yes and you're not programmed
to murder cowards.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.073
If they won't fight back,
what will you do?

40:05.200 --> 40:07.589
We will not go back.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.554
You are programmed to survive.
You can survive on Lunar V.

40:11.680 --> 40:16.879
To survive is not enough.
To simply exist is not enough.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.430
Roga, tell them what you want.

40:23.360 --> 40:28.832
We want our lives back.
We want to come home.

40:29.680 --> 40:34.117
I am not prepared
to negotiate under threat, Danar.

40:35.600 --> 40:40.594
But if you put down your weapons
and return to Lunar V...,

40:42.120 --> 40:43.553
..l would be willing.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.199
Mr. Prime Minister,
with all due respect,

40:48.320 --> 40:52.598
you will have to force us.
Or at least try.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.712
Captain, you must do something.
Call your ship.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.558
Quite right, Prime Minister.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.752
Enterprise, prepare to beam
the away team back.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.110
At your command, Captain.

41:05.240 --> 41:07.470
You can't leave us like this!

41:07.600 --> 41:12.276
I know all I need for my report.
Your prisoner's been returned to you.

41:12.400 --> 41:17.838
It's your decision, to try and
force them back or welcome them home.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.713
In your own words,
this isn't our affair.

41:20.840 --> 41:25.152
We cannot interfere in the natural
course of your society's development.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.272
I'd say it's going
to develop significantly

41:28.400 --> 41:29.879
in the next few minutes.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.075
It's been an interesting visit.
When you're ready for membership

41:37.200 --> 41:40.988
the Federation
will reconsider your application.

41:41.120 --> 41:45.398
- Mr. Riker, four to beam up.
- Aye, sir.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.119
Success, Captain?

42:08.240 --> 42:12.279
Number One, will you note
in our report

42:12.400 --> 42:16.075
that if the government of Angosia
survives the night,

42:16.200 --> 42:19.988
we'll assist them in their efforts
to reprogram their veterans.

42:20.120 --> 42:25.672
- If the government doesn't survive?
- I've a feeling they will choose to.

42:27.080 --> 42:31.596
Mr. Crusher, set coordinates
for Starbase Lya III.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.916
- Coordinates set, sir.
- Engage.
