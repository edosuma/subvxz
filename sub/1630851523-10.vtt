WEBVTT

00:06.571 --> 00:08.747
<i>That pasta primavera
Jay made really hit the spot,</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:10.140
smell-wise.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.576
Probably the most satisfying
meal I've experienced

00:11.620 --> 00:14.144
since losing the ability
to consume food.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.885
Jay, guess who I just got off
the phone with.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.409
Kenny and Liz,
from good old Park Slope.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.107
- Love Kenny and Liz.
- The best.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.065
So, remember when we saw them
get engaged on Instagram

00:22.109 --> 00:24.024
and we never got the invite
to the wedding?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.286
Mm, I bet we were the last cut.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.288
Yes, you tell yourself that.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.072
Well,
the wedding venue

00:29.116 --> 00:32.206
they were dead set on
fell through.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.599
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

00:34.643 --> 00:35.774
Kenny and Liz want to get
married at Woodstone Mansion

00:35.818 --> 00:37.037
in two weeks.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.429
Ooh.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.388
Thank God I died
dressed to the nines.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.563
Babe, this could be huge for us.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.086
If we pull this off,

00:43.130 --> 00:44.261
with all Kenny and Liz's fancy

00:44.305 --> 00:45.654
made-the-cut friends
in attendance,

00:45.697 --> 00:47.438
it could really land us
on the map.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.657
You know, it's embarrassing
how excited you all get

00:48.700 --> 00:51.268
about a woman becoming
a man's property.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.791
Then again, if you put on
"We Are Family,"

00:52.835 --> 00:55.142
I'm on the dance floor,
- no questions asked.
- Right?

00:55.185 --> 00:58.971
There is one teeny-tiny hoop
we have to jump through.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.756
Hoop? What kind of hoop?

01:00.799 --> 01:03.019
Before Woodstone Mansion
is officially booked,

01:03.063 --> 01:07.067
Liz's family is sending Michael
Davenport to check it out.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.070
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

01:10.113 --> 01:11.114
Manhattan's top wedding planner?

01:11.158 --> 01:12.724
Notoriously hard to please?

01:12.768 --> 01:15.336
Okay, well, uh,
wh-when's he coming?

01:15.379 --> 01:16.946
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:16.989 --> 01:20.036
Sam, this house is a disaster.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.646
We got pigeons in the attic.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.648
Uh, w-we got lights
flickering everywhere.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.389
Honey, please,
we'll get it done.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.043
He's not wrong,
this place looks haunted.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.610
I mean, it is haunted.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.873
But you don't want people
to think that.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.750
- Come on.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.535
Why?

01:40.578 --> 01:43.407
Jay?

01:43.451 --> 01:45.583
Good news, the pigeon
guy's on his way.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.977
Bad news, the stupid electrician
just canceled again.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.022
Seriously?
That's the third time.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.154
He said his dog
isn't feeling well.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.199
- No.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.244
No "aw."
You'll never be successful

01:54.288 --> 01:55.811
in business if you let
the help walk all over you.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.334
Hetty, his dog
isn't feeling well.

01:57.378 --> 01:58.683
Poppycock.
He's probably

01:58.727 --> 02:00.032
playing dice
with the other roughnecks.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.556
That's what they do. They lie.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.123
They imbibe and they lie.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.255
I think I could fix this.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.301
Uh, Jay, please be careful.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.041
I've watched HGTV
so many times, babe,

02:09.085 --> 02:10.826
I'm practically
a Property Brother.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.089
And not the lame one, the one
that actually fixes things.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.525
Okay, well, do you
have your menu ready

02:14.569 --> 02:16.048
for the wedding planner?

02:16.092 --> 02:18.094
I'm going to dazzle him.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.878
I've been training
my whole life for this, babe.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.707
Just leave the cooking
to your man.

02:22.751 --> 02:26.711
He cooks, you work,
your dynamic is grotesque.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.278
Yeah! Yeah, I can do this.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.888
Careful, you cad.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.890
Those sconces are made
of pure leaded crystal.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.718
They are worth more
than Oklahoma.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.677
Okay, yep.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.287
Easy-peasy...

02:39.768 --> 02:41.726
Ah...

02:41.770 --> 02:42.858
Jay!

02:42.901 --> 02:44.468
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

02:44.512 --> 02:45.904
What's going on?

02:45.948 --> 02:47.167
I think Jay
electrocuted himself.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.559
Oh, he's fine. Ben
Franklin used to do

02:48.603 --> 02:50.996
the same thing all the
time for attention.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.217
More like <i>Needy Richard's
Almanack,am I right?</i>

02:54.261 --> 02:55.392
Honey, are you all right?
Ooh!

02:55.436 --> 02:57.481
Don't get fresh
with me, young lady.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.048
- Okay.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.529
Uh, maybe you should go
lay down.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.792
We have some time
before Michael arrives.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.186
A brief respite.
Perhaps you're right.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.275
Straighten your back.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.667
You're hunched over
like a washer woman.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.199
Hey, have you guys seen Hetty?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.113
Uh, sorry, I haven't seen her.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.289
Hmm, that's weird.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.116
She wasn't
at our morning walk, either.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.248
Well, she's bound to turn up.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.119
It's not like any of us
can leave.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.033
Remind me how that works.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.042
Why does that happen?

03:37.086 --> 03:38.218
We don't know, Sam.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.436
Why do we go through the walls

03:39.480 --> 03:41.133
but not fall through the floor?

03:41.177 --> 03:42.439
It's not like we got a manual.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.702
Ugh, would love a death manual.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.096
Huge manual guy.
Love being told what to do.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.011
There's a man in
uniform here, Sam.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.926
I'll be honest,
it's not a great man

03:50.969 --> 03:52.449
nor a great uniform.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.059
Oh, nice,
that's the bird removal guy.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.452
He's here to take care
of the pigeons.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.802
Murphy?

03:57.846 --> 04:00.718
Before we let that Irishman
in here, we need to lock up

04:00.762 --> 04:02.981
the good china
and count the spoons!

04:03.025 --> 04:04.766
Mm-mm, no, no, no, no, no.

04:04.809 --> 04:05.897
Mm, excuse me?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.464
What?

04:07.508 --> 04:09.118
Since when does Jay
hate the Irish?

04:09.161 --> 04:10.728
Excuse me, sir?

04:10.772 --> 04:12.382
Yes, yes, yes, you.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.210
Are you a member
of a labor union?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.777
There is a wrong answer.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.866
- Excuse me?
- I warn you,

04:17.909 --> 04:20.956
if a single sugar bowl goes
missing before the wedding...

04:22.174 --> 04:24.655
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.918
- Oh, dear.
- What is it? What's going on?

04:26.962 --> 04:29.791
The reason none of us
have seen Hetty is because she

04:29.834 --> 04:32.054
is in there.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.447
In the van?

04:33.490 --> 04:34.839
What? No.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.754
In where? Isaac,
you're freaking me out.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.366
She's in Jay, Samantha!

04:39.409 --> 04:40.845
Uh, question,
have you got enough room

04:40.889 --> 04:43.761
in that van
for all your potatoes?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.590
That was a good one.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.512
Ah, what? What do you mean,
I'm inside of Jay's body?

04:55.556 --> 04:57.209
How? When?

04:57.253 --> 04:59.429
That's not mine.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.431
No, this isn't happening.
Possession isn't real.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.085
Possession can't be real.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.305
Neither are ghosts,
yet here we are.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.350
Gather the ghosts.
Wait a minute.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.091
Where are
all the ghosts?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.919
Oh, no.
Isaac would know what to do.

05:10.962 --> 05:14.226
Hey, Hetty or Jay or
whoever, we're right here.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.576
They're right here.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.578
That's interesting.
She can't see us.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.840
Oh, no, no, no.

05:18.883 --> 05:19.841
This can't be happening.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.146
No!

05:21.190 --> 05:22.452
J-Jay? Are you in there?

05:25.194 --> 05:26.935
Jay.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.806
Jay.
Oh, this is so weird.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.547
- Oh, my gosh. It's you.
- Yeah, yeah, it's me, babe.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.983
He's back.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.029
Oh, that's good.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.509
I don't know what's happening.
I-I was changing the light,

05:35.552 --> 05:36.988
and-and then
there was a big spark,

05:37.032 --> 05:38.599
then I fell on the ground
and I came to,

05:38.642 --> 05:40.731
except I wasn't in control
of my own body.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.254
Somebody tell me,
what is happening?

05:42.298 --> 05:43.995
I've been trying to tell you.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.954
- We've seen this happen before.
- I haven't.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.390
This is why we need
a death manual.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.392
The year was 1883,
and Woodstone

05:49.436 --> 05:50.872
was just being wired
for the gift of electricity

05:50.915 --> 05:53.570
when a poor workman
electrified himself

05:53.614 --> 05:55.572
and hurled toward a ghost.

05:55.616 --> 05:56.878
Me.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.009
Oh, boy.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.315
What? What?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
It was quite
the interesting experience,

06:00.403 --> 06:01.796
being inside another man.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.363
Hold up, I've sat
through 20 years

06:03.406 --> 06:05.539
of Pete droning on and on
about how to tie

06:05.582 --> 06:08.455
every kind of knot, I could've
been possessing people?

06:08.498 --> 06:09.847
Oh, come on,
I remember you perked up

06:09.891 --> 06:11.675
when I covered cow hitches.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.721
Possession is nearly impossible
to do on purpose.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.462
It requires a confluence
of events

06:15.505 --> 06:17.115
that are almost unreplicable.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.727
So, how do we get Hetty
out of my husband's body?

06:19.770 --> 06:23.383
Oh, my God, I'm literally being
colonized from the inside out.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.862
Sh-She's coming back.

06:27.169 --> 06:28.910
Hmm. Oh, my God.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.520
Why is it so damp in here?

06:30.564 --> 06:32.348
Samantha,
tell Hetty that this is

06:32.392 --> 06:34.306
just like when I possessed
her workman,

06:34.350 --> 06:37.135
and we have to do
the same thing to fix it.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.094
Hetty-- I can't believe
I'm calling you this.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.139
Well, it is my name,
young lady.

06:41.183 --> 06:43.620
Isaac says this is like the time
he possessed your workman.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.579
Oh, my God,

06:45.622 --> 06:47.494
there might be a way
out of this hellhole yet.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.104
Well, what is it?

06:49.147 --> 06:50.453
An exorcism.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.326
Cool.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.679
Oh, okay, well,
I'll see you then.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.332
Question, if you're unable
to get the ghost

07:00.376 --> 07:02.900
out of my husband, is there some
sort of refund policy, or...?

07:02.944 --> 07:04.424
Hello?

07:04.467 --> 07:05.816
- Well?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.035
That was the only priest I found

07:07.078 --> 07:08.776
who didn't immediately
hang up on me.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.213
And he can't make it till
Monday. He said he's slammed.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.954
You mean I got to walk around
with this Victorian lady

07:12.997 --> 07:14.912
inside of me till Monday?

07:14.956 --> 07:16.784
Th-The important thing
is we have a solution.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.568
The ghosts have literally
seen this work before.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.265
You're gonna be okay.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.180
Everything is gonna be okay.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.445
Sam, the wedding planner's here!

07:25.488 --> 07:27.011
Oh, God, we're so screwed.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.232
Mr. Davenport.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.800
Please come in.

07:32.843 --> 07:36.020
Welcome.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.893
I'm Samantha
and this is my husband Jay.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.721
I am a man.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.940
And as such,
I will shake your hand.

07:42.984 --> 07:47.945
Mr. and Mrs. Arondekar,
it's a pleasure to meet you...

07:47.989 --> 07:49.686
Oh, my. The last time
I felt palms this soft,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.558
I was shaking hands
with a Vanderbilt.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.081
That felt like a misstep.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.213
He makes jokes,
but don't worry, he makes food

07:55.257 --> 07:56.998
- way better.
- Good pivot.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.870
Hmm. It's a little more beat-up
than in the pictures.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.872
Sam and Jay have taken
forever with the renovations.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.613
Mostly due to the fact
that they are...

08:03.657 --> 08:05.528
...very poor.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.226
I'm confused. I thought,
uh, I thought you were Jay.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.402
Oh, yeah, Jay likes to refer
to himself in the third person.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.493
It's one of his many interesting
talented chef quirks.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.800
I'm back.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.280
Oh.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.152
Uh, okay,
shall we discuss the menu?

08:21.196 --> 08:22.850
This is a train wreck.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.505
Yes, the menu.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.767
Of course, okay,
first of all, Michael,

08:26.810 --> 08:29.117
so glad you came
up here, and, um,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.293
as far as the menu
is concerned, I was thinking

08:31.336 --> 08:33.164
we could go
the traditional route.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.993
We could do a poached salmon,
root vegetables,

08:36.037 --> 08:37.691
maybe a demi-glace.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.954
- Tried and true.
- Exactly.

08:39.997 --> 08:40.955
But you're not tried
and true, are you?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.043
And neither are
Kenny and Liz.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.132
So, for their wedding,

08:44.175 --> 08:46.438
I have planned something
that I think

08:46.482 --> 08:51.835
is going to knock
your socks off...

08:53.881 --> 08:55.926
No, what-what,
well, what is it?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.667
What is it?
What is it?

09:01.584 --> 09:03.368
Sorry.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.805
Hmm, that was strange.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.023
I don't know what happened
there. Where were we?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.242
Well, the menu.
I'm rapt. What is it?

09:07.285 --> 09:09.374
- The menu?
- For the wedding, let's have it.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.246
You know, there's a Diet Coke in
the kitchen with your name on it

09:11.289 --> 09:12.508
I have yet to offer you.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.554
Ooh! Boiled calf's head.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.294
Heron pudding.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.252
Eel pie.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.906
Beaver tail.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.082
And squab.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.824
I love it.

09:23.867 --> 09:24.781
- Of course you do.
- Huh?

09:24.825 --> 09:26.087
A heritage menu celebrating

09:26.130 --> 09:27.523
the history
of the Hudson Valley.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.700
It's remarkable. No one
is doing anything like this.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.397
Well, we do things
differently around here.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.053
Oh, can I trouble you for
some cocaine? I'm all out.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.142
There's that
jokester. You know,

09:38.186 --> 09:39.535
we're just gonna be
in the kitchen fixing things up,

09:39.579 --> 09:40.754
but you-you relax.

09:40.797 --> 09:41.755
I'm not joking.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.582
Hmm.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.846
Jay. Jay, where are you?

09:45.889 --> 09:47.108
We need you. Just...

09:47.151 --> 09:48.544
Oh!

09:48.588 --> 09:49.893
Ow!

09:49.937 --> 09:51.591
It was already me.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
Sorry, I didn't know.
W-Wait, where do you go?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.724
- What happens?
- I don't know.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.508
It's so weird.
When she takes over,

09:56.552 --> 09:57.988
it's like I'm there
but I'm not there.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.730
I can see, I can hear,
but I can't talk.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.993
Can you hear her voice,
like, inside your head?

10:03.037 --> 10:04.212
Yeah, actually,
I can hear her right now.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.735
She talks kind of old-timey.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.345
She's really not a fan
of you having a job

10:07.389 --> 10:09.130
or being able to drive.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.566
Oh. I know it's strange,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.263
but it's kind of sweet
that you two met.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.701
- Not ideal circumstances.
- Quick,

10:14.744 --> 10:16.311
before she takes over
and shoves me aside again,

10:16.354 --> 10:17.704
what are we going to do?

10:17.747 --> 10:19.140
We don't have any of the things

10:19.183 --> 10:20.924
that she told the wedding
planner we were gonna make.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.665
Well, isn't there,
like, a-a fancy shop

10:22.709 --> 10:24.885
or a specialty meat place
that you know about?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.713
People don't eat boiled calves'
heads and beaver tails anymore.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.540
We found better things.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.108
What about squab? I feel like
I've heard of that. What is it?

10:31.152 --> 10:32.588
It's, like, a game bird.
It's kind of like a pigeon,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.416
but I don't know where
we'd find one in the next hour.

10:36.244 --> 10:37.680
I'm confused.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.464
You want the birds back?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.031
Uh-huh. Yep.

10:41.075 --> 10:41.815
But why?

10:41.858 --> 10:43.773
W-Well, I just...

10:43.817 --> 10:45.688
You know, I thought
about it a little more,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.473
and I realized that getting rid
of them might be inhumane.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.259
Babe, I need
those pigeons ASAP, okay?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
I'm reading online
that they take an hour to cook!

10:53.348 --> 10:54.654
Hey, Murph!

10:58.788 --> 11:00.050
Thank you.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.712
- Yeah, that's coming along.
So, can Hetty taste

11:09.756 --> 11:12.715
what he tastes even when she's
not in control of the body?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.891
Well, if it's anything like
when I possessed that workman,

11:14.935 --> 11:17.067
then yes. She can taste.
She can touch.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.548
She feels everything he feels.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.593
I'd give anything to
taste a Hot Pocket again.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.249
Ooh...!

11:25.293 --> 11:27.295
Mmm!

11:27.338 --> 11:30.428
Tasting food for the first time
in 130 years.

11:33.127 --> 11:36.217
If women had orgasms,
this is what it would feel like.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.089
Hetty!

11:39.133 --> 11:40.961
Please stop taking over my body,
okay?

11:41.004 --> 11:43.485
I got a sauce simmering,
and you don't know anything

11:43.528 --> 11:44.965
- about cooking.
Oh, let her live!

11:45.008 --> 11:47.445
- Come on.
- Seriously.
Dick move, bro.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.753
So, uh, we could talk more
about the chocolate fountain.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.102
We've gone over the
fountain three times now.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.625
What I'd like
is to sample

11:53.669 --> 11:56.585
the cuisine you said would
be ready over an hour ago.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.847
Mm, dude ain't happy.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.544
My patience is coming to an end.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.199
I promise it'll just be
a teensy-weensy bit longer.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.506
Trust me, that man really knows
what he's doing in the kitchen.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.116
Oh, my God!

12:06.160 --> 12:09.076
I've never tasted peanut butter!

12:09.119 --> 12:10.468
- Mmm!
- You got to help,
Sam, Flower.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.428
Okay. I'm sending you
really good vibes, Sam.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.126
I'm sorry. I think I've
made a mistake coming here.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.258
You two aren't ready

12:17.301 --> 12:19.782
to hold a toddler's
birthday party,

12:19.826 --> 12:21.610
much less a Davenport wedding.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.611
- Mm.
- Oh...

12:22.654 --> 12:24.178
No, I mean your power.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.441
You know, what happens
when you walk through people.

12:26.484 --> 12:27.964
- Oh!
- No, wait,

12:28.008 --> 12:30.010
please don't go.
We really need this wedding.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.186
I will say this once, so
hear me loud and clear...

12:34.841 --> 12:36.233
Oh...

12:36.277 --> 12:39.367
I am high as a songbird.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.586
Whoa...

12:41.630 --> 12:42.805
What are you doing?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.720
Buying you time.
Now go get lunch ready.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.591
This ain't gonna
last forever.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.723
Tell him to look at
the wallpaper in the bathroom.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.811
Trust me.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.034
Whoa...

13:02.694 --> 13:04.914
God bless her. This is
exactly what I'd be doing.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.307
Bye-bye,
chiseled physique.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.482
- Mmm.
Jay?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.614
What is going on?

13:09.658 --> 13:10.615
Oh, Hetty's started to, um,

13:10.659 --> 13:11.791
enjoy Jay's body

13:11.834 --> 13:13.140
- a bit more.
- Samantha,

13:13.183 --> 13:15.403
Cheetos are divine.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.579
This is a bender. And I
have seen some epic benders.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.582
Lehman Brothers Thursday happy
hour was the stuff of legend.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.410
Oh!

13:23.454 --> 13:25.805
I'm back.
Sam, she's getting stronger.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.067
It's getting harder and harder
for me to keep her from...

13:28.111 --> 13:29.417
Oh! Silence!

13:29.460 --> 13:31.811
Mm, tired
of your blathering.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.204
This is like watching
McEnroe-Connors.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.381
Hetty, I need you
to let Jay finish cooking.

13:37.425 --> 13:41.777
No! For the first time in 130
years, I'm actually living, Sam.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.345
And I won't let <i>you
take that away from me.</i>

13:46.042 --> 13:48.044
We're not waiting
for any priest.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.351
We're doing this exorcism
ourselves.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.700
Awesome.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.102
How are you
doing, Michael?

14:02.145 --> 14:04.017
It's all good in the hood.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.496
Yeah, you got
about a half an hour

14:05.540 --> 14:06.889
till Cinderella's carriage
turns back

14:06.933 --> 14:08.978
into an uptight
wedding planner.

14:09.022 --> 14:09.892
Do you need
anything?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.154
Suggest crayons

14:11.198 --> 14:12.590
and a coloring book.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.245
Maybe crayons and
a coloring book?

14:15.289 --> 14:18.901
That would be amazing
right about now. Yeah.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.207
I'm an excellent guide.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.907
And that is how you perform
a home exorcism.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
If you liked this, please check
out my other how-to videos,

14:26.822 --> 14:28.128
including DIY vampire killing

14:28.171 --> 14:30.652
and rom-com writing made easy.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.481
So, exorcism for dummies.
That's what we're doing here?

14:33.524 --> 14:35.570
If you have a better idea,
now would be a really good time

14:35.613 --> 14:37.659
- to share it.
- Having gone
through one myself,

14:37.702 --> 14:39.704
I will say that instructional
was quite on point.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.576
And it's well-paced, too.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.143
Sam, are we sure about this?

14:43.186 --> 14:44.144
I mean,
you're really gonna tie Jay

14:44.187 --> 14:46.537
to the bed?
And with those knots?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.061
We're out of options.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.628
We can't keep Michael Flower'd
back there much longer.

14:50.672 --> 14:51.629
I could walk through him again.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.240
But it does hurt me a lot.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.416
And also he might start to
forget childhood memories.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.634
Oh!

14:56.678 --> 14:58.680
Damn these solid doors!

14:58.723 --> 15:01.422
Oh! Samantha, you said
you had something up here

15:01.465 --> 15:02.727
called Hot Cheetos.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.686
I must know how
they keep them warm.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.209
I-I actually just needed
to talk to you,

15:06.253 --> 15:07.950
and I didn't know how else
to get you out of that kitchen.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.691
Why are there
ropes on the bed?

15:11.736 --> 15:14.130
Hetty, I know
you've had fun in that body.

15:14.174 --> 15:17.742
But Jay and I have a lot
riding on today going well.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.788
We need this to end now.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.007
An exorcism?

15:21.050 --> 15:22.922
No! I don't want to.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.445
- I'm not ready.
- Hetty, it's time.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.099
I need my husband back.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.014
Stop thinking about yourself.
Think about Jay.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.537
That's just it.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.147
I never thought of myself.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.149
My whole life, I did
everything for my husband

15:33.193 --> 15:34.716
and put my needs second.

15:34.759 --> 15:38.111
I didn't live the
life I should have.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.114
There are so many things
I didn't get to do.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.029
I've never been to Paris.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.030
Okay.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.857
Well, now I have another chance.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.859
And I'm not going to waste it!

15:50.036 --> 15:53.213
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No! No! No!

15:57.347 --> 15:58.609
Ow!

15:58.653 --> 16:00.350
Damn it!

16:02.657 --> 16:05.051
Hetty!

16:07.227 --> 16:09.098
Okay, she won't even be
able to turn the car on.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.057
Unless Jay has his key
in his pocket.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.843
Uh, how do I turn you on?
On, on? "Start"?

16:14.886 --> 16:16.279
It can't be that simple.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.411
Hetty!

16:17.454 --> 16:18.586
Stupid auto lock!

16:21.067 --> 16:23.069
Please! Come on! You-- No.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.158
Paris, here I come!

16:25.201 --> 16:27.247
Hetty! No!

16:29.379 --> 16:31.033
What do you think'll happen
when they get to the end
of the property?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.208
Either the speed
gets 'em through the boundary

16:32.252 --> 16:33.514
or he bounces back.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.819
Maybe Jay dies.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.169
I don't know.
This is a new one.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.447
I'm back. Aah!

16:58.495 --> 16:59.627
Jay!

17:01.672 --> 17:02.934
Whew.

17:02.978 --> 17:06.547
<i>Au revoir, Paris.</i>

17:06.590 --> 17:08.984
Oh.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.420
Jay.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.641
Jay. Jay, are
you all right?

17:13.684 --> 17:15.077
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh!

17:15.121 --> 17:17.688
Yeah, I think so.
W-Wait, is she out of my body?

17:17.732 --> 17:19.386
Yeah. Yeah, she flew out when
you hit the ghost boundary.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.562
Oh, my God,
I'm so happy you're back.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.911
Ah. I'm happy, too.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.434
Is she okay?
'Cause I feel drunk.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.610
Oh. Sam!

17:26.654 --> 17:28.438
Your wedding planner's losing
interest in the coloring book!

17:28.482 --> 17:30.136
You better get in here!

17:30.179 --> 17:33.008
- Let's go.
- Ooh, I hope our house
has tasty pigeons.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.011
<i>I'm not entirely sure</i>

17:36.055 --> 17:37.534
what came over me.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.101
I, uh, did take

17:39.145 --> 17:41.190
some allergy medicine
for the pollen out here.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.845
Oh, definitely the
allergy medicine.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.933
Oh, yeah,
that can be

17:44.976 --> 17:46.804
pretty strong
these days. Uh,

17:46.848 --> 17:49.329
so sorry it's a
little bit late, but...

17:49.372 --> 17:50.808
worth the wait.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.462
I'll be the judge of that.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.821
Mmm.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.606
Hmm.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.303
Is that a good noise?
Is he happy?

18:07.347 --> 18:08.870
Mm...

18:08.913 --> 18:10.350
Mmm.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.699
Hmm?

18:11.742 --> 18:14.484
Mm, what is this spice?

18:14.528 --> 18:15.529
By the looks, I'd say paprika

18:15.572 --> 18:17.183
or maybe saffron.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.185
But, no, that's not it.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.969
It's unlike anything
I've ever had.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.971
What you're
tasting, Michael,

18:23.014 --> 18:24.625
is Cheetos dust.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.498
Cheetos dust?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.152
That's right.
Really?

18:35.549 --> 18:36.724
How whimsical.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.986
I love it.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.509
Oh, my God. You do?

18:39.553 --> 18:42.773
Mmm. Such an inspired update
on a traditional dish.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.863
Mmm. Mr. and Mrs. Arondekar,

18:45.907 --> 18:47.778
the wedding is yours.

18:47.822 --> 18:48.562
Yes!

18:49.954 --> 18:50.912
Hell yeah!

18:50.955 --> 18:52.087
Now, from where do you, um,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.263
source your squab?

18:54.307 --> 18:56.265
Uh... locally.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.876
Very, very... locally.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.842
I just have one question.
What were Sour Patch Kids like?

19:07.885 --> 19:10.453
It was a flavor explosion,

19:10.497 --> 19:11.889
- my dear.
I know you're disappointed

19:11.933 --> 19:14.327
that you didn't get
the chance to leave, but...

19:14.370 --> 19:16.285
if it means anything,
we're happy to have you back.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.548
It was an exciting day.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.551
But it was strange
not to be able to see you all.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.945
It has been my constant
dream for the last century.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.730
But then, when it
actually happened...

19:26.774 --> 19:28.210
I missed you guys.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.907
Aw, really?
You missed us?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.387
I'm not repeating it.

19:31.431 --> 19:34.085
Hetty, hey,
how are you feeling?

19:34.129 --> 19:36.044
A little embarrassed
by my actions.

19:36.087 --> 19:39.003
But if you'd lived my
life, you'd understand.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.920
Don't live your life
with regrets, Samantha.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.314
Go after your dreams.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.359
Because you are only
here for a short time.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.666
If you're lucky.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.886
That's good advice.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.671
I'm sorry that I... got a
little carried away today.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.369
And I'm grateful

19:56.412 --> 19:58.501
that you didn't try
to fornicate with me.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.460
Uh... hey, Hetty,

20:00.503 --> 20:02.331
wherever you are.
Uh, just wanted

20:02.375 --> 20:03.985
to say thanks for
helping me with the menu.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.595
I wish I could say
I owe you,

20:05.639 --> 20:06.901
but you kind of kidnapped me

20:06.944 --> 20:07.989
and tried to take me to Paris...

20:08.032 --> 20:09.686
so let's just call it even.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.861
That's fair.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.167
Hello?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.300
It's the electrician.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.171
Oh, no, you can't make it
till next week?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.564
- He's canceling.
- No, no, no.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.130
Give me the phone.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.698
Hello.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.352
You listen up and
you listen up good.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.484
You will honor
your commitment

20:24.527 --> 20:26.225
or we will find
a new electrician.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.139
Do you hear me,
guttersnipe?

20:29.315 --> 20:31.578
Cool. Thanks. Bye.

20:31.621 --> 20:32.927
He's on his way.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.494
- That was kind of sexy.
- Ooh.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.496
I guess I still have a little
bit of Hetty left in me.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.280
That wasn't.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.282
Oh, that's right.
You're related.
