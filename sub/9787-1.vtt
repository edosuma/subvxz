00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:40.974 --> 00:42.708
- Well aren't you
quite the tiger?

00:44.210 --> 00:45.210
Meow.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
Dammit.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.729
I forgot to get cigarettes.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.466
You don't smoke, do you?

01:08.668 --> 01:09.735
Fuck.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.104
I got to quit anyway.

01:18.111 --> 01:19.745
Now you want to talk to me.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.481
Fucking bitch.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.417
It's my goddamn ex.

01:29.022 --> 01:32.524
Leave me alone, I don't
care about your drama.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.696
You know, I really
wish she would just

01:37.698 --> 01:40.132
slit her wrists and get
it over with already.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.205
I'm sorry.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.342
I shouldn't be
talking about her.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.712
Fuck, I practically couldn't
shut the fuck up about her

01:53.714 --> 01:55.147
at the bar.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.617
I can't help it.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.554
That cunt's probably taken
years off my life already.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.493
Jeez.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.561
It's like 100 freaking
degrees in here,

02:09.562 --> 02:11.330
I'm sweating bullets.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.831
You mind if I take a shower?

02:28.181 --> 02:29.148
Yea.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.086
What have we got here?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.326
Jackpot.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.359
Planning on joining me?

03:18.231 --> 03:20.632
Hey, I didn't catch your name.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.468
Or I forgot it anyway.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.371
Hello?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.707
What are you waiting for?

03:35.315 --> 03:36.648
You're a strange girl.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.620
What the fuck is wrong with you?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.290
That is not sexy.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.440
- I'll be home as soon as I can.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.475
Did you really sleep all day?

07:26.612 --> 07:27.479
Tomorrow.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.314
I still have to work.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.250
We can spend all day together,

07:32.252 --> 07:35.253
just you and me.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.164
Hello Ms. Samantha,
how are you today?

07:47.667 --> 07:50.135
I'm very well, thank you.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.404
Would you like to dance?

07:54.273 --> 07:57.642
La la la, la la la la.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.078
La la, la la, la la.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.252
Quack quack quack,
quack quack quack.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.393
Oh no!

08:17.029 --> 08:19.097
Ms. Tiffany, what happened?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.667
Okay, we'll fix that one.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.592
There we are, good as new.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.332
Would you like to have some tea?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.744
Pinkies up.

09:10.182 --> 09:10.949
Mm.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.728
You hear something?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.537
- Come on, hello?

09:36.042 --> 09:37.008
- Yes?

09:37.877 --> 09:39.678
- Hi, I'm Karl from next door.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.180
Um, would you mind
turning your music down

09:42.182 --> 09:43.381
just a touch?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.749
I got to be up at
the crack of dawn,

09:44.751 --> 09:47.085
and it's almost 2:00am.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.854
- Oh my god, I completely
lost track of time.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.256
Um, I'm sorry.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.758
- It's all good.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.193
Normally I wouldn't care,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.262
I actually like what
you were playing.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.064
It's just that I have an
audition in the morning,

09:59.066 --> 10:00.732
and I'm going to be
a mess if I don't get

10:00.734 --> 10:02.133
at least six hours.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.102
- I'll keep it down, I promise.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.371
I should go to bed myself.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.474
- I totally appreciate
it, thank you.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.042
Tomorrow though, play your shit

10:11.044 --> 10:12.677
as loud as you want.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.880
I won't complain, I promise.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.318
- That's really sweet, but I'm
usually never up this late.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.954
- Sure you're not.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.956
Don't worry, I'm
an insomniac too.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.025
- What do you mean?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.127
- These walls are super thin.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.229
I mean I'm not
eavesdropping or anything,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.631
but I hear you sometimes.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.566
- Hear me what?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.736
- I need to go pass out now,

10:38.170 --> 10:39.537
wish me luck tomorrow.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.106
- Break a leg.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.550
What?

10:54.687 --> 10:56.321
Don't look at me like that.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.357
Just some guy.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.760
I guess he lives next door.

11:03.262 --> 11:04.663
I've never seen him before.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.333
Stop.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.269
I don't even remember.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.438
Karl I think?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.242
Jeez.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.778
Honey, it wasn't like that.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.017
Fine.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.185
Be that way.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.196
Stop!

11:40.032 --> 11:41.099
What are you doing?

11:42.234 --> 11:43.568
Get off of me!

11:44.036 --> 11:45.537
Stop please!

11:48.174 --> 11:48.940
Stop!

11:49.675 --> 11:51.209
What are you doing?

11:51.677 --> 11:53.912
Stop it, get off of me!

12:03.589 --> 12:05.256
You bitch!

12:05.424 --> 12:08.093
Why, why did you do that?

12:14.266 --> 12:17.202
I didn't cheat on you!

12:20.206 --> 12:22.140
You're just like the others!

12:22.341 --> 12:24.209
None of you trust me!

12:24.211 --> 12:28.113
No one ever trusts me!

13:26.672 --> 13:28.072
- That ass.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.241
I can't look away from
it, it's sucking me in

13:30.243 --> 13:32.644
like a beautiful gaping vortex.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.145
- A vortex of awesomeness.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.683
- Look at her, she
takes cock like a champ!

13:38.685 --> 13:39.984
Actually, doesn't
she remind you of

13:39.986 --> 13:42.153
that chick from the
kill our virgin films?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.922
- Kind of, think it's her?

13:44.423 --> 13:47.325
- Nah, nah, her tits
were way bigger.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.529
Come on baby, keep working.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.697
- Hey Mara, come here a sec.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.232
- Yea?

13:55.434 --> 13:56.601
- Check this chick out,
fucking smoking, right?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.336
- She is very attractive.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.671
- Have a seat.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.172
You're just in time
for the money shot.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.975
- The werewolf suit's
done, and the mask.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.210
I'll work on the
fur in the morning.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.344
- Oh snap!

14:06.346 --> 14:07.779
Covered those tits!

14:08.948 --> 14:10.148
- You guys have a good night,

14:10.150 --> 14:11.049
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.483
- Where you going, hot date?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.152
- A bunch of us are meeting
over at bar eight later.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.053
You should come.

14:15.055 --> 14:15.887
- I can't.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.055
- You never come out.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.356
What do you do after work?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.657
Don't tell me you just
sit home every night

14:19.659 --> 14:21.192
watching netflix with
like, a dozen cats.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.661
- Rain check, okay?

14:23.663 --> 14:26.130
I'm exhausted, and I have
a ton of sketches to do.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.299
- I could come over
and rub your shoulders

14:28.301 --> 14:29.701
while you draw.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.737
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.309
- One day I'm going to hit that.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.279
I'm going to hit
that so fucking hard.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.882
- Good luck with that, you
have a better shot with her.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.217
- Nah man, no, Mara acts
all innocent and weird,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.719
but deep down, she's carving it

14:47.721 --> 14:49.454
just like every other girl.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.322
I bet she gets
really freaky too,

14:51.324 --> 14:53.491
like whips and chains and shit.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.492
- You say so, man.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.594
- Trust me, I know chicks.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.730
- Be sure to tell my
all about it Casanova.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.098
- Fuck off.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.098
- Any idea how long
'till the next bus?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.266
- One's supposed
to come in like,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.735
15 minutes, but
they're always late,

15:37.737 --> 15:39.003
so who knows?

15:40.139 --> 15:41.205
- Damn.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.908
My car broke own a
few blocks from here,

15:43.910 --> 15:45.109
and I really need to get home.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.711
- Sucks.

15:50.749 --> 15:51.649
- Hey.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.484
You're really cute.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.397
- Hey Mara.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.801
What's going on?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.237
- You fainted.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.740
I wasn't sure what to do.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.742
So I brought you home.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.711
- I fainted?

16:19.945 --> 16:20.812
- Here.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.146
Drink some of this.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.215
It'll help relax you.

16:24.750 --> 16:25.984
- Thanks.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.393
- I love this song.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.328
Dance with me?

16:39.698 --> 16:41.265
- What's wrong with me?

16:41.267 --> 16:42.800
- You'll be fine
in a few minutes.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.269
It just takes a second for
the chloroform to wear off.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.270
- What?

16:46.272 --> 16:47.438
- I'm joking!

16:47.806 --> 16:49.374
Here, have some more wine.

16:50.309 --> 16:51.509
- Who are you?

16:57.282 --> 16:58.716
- You don't remember?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.852
We met at the bus stop.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.988
I sat next to you,
we started talking,

17:03.990 --> 17:06.223
you fainted, etc., etc.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.192
You're lucky I was there.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.296
There are all sorts of crazies
out there at this hour.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.298
- I need to get home.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.867
Um, where's my stuff?

17:16.635 --> 17:18.803
- It's over there, what
are you looking for?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.304
- I need to call a cab.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.241
- Nonsense, you
should stay here.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.044
You're in no condition
to be out in the streets.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.046
- I'll be fine, I just.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.215
- You could pass out again.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.316
And then what?

17:32.318 --> 17:34.152
The cab driver could
do all sorts of

17:34.154 --> 17:35.453
sick things to you.

17:35.754 --> 17:36.921
- I have to go.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.059
Fuck!

17:41.061 --> 17:42.093
I'm so dizzy!

17:43.696 --> 17:45.229
- You're a med student, right?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.900
Well, you know what
the instrument thing is

17:48.902 --> 17:50.101
for lobotomies?

17:50.103 --> 17:51.202
What's that called?

17:51.204 --> 17:52.603
- What?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.238
- I tried to find one
on the Internet before

17:54.240 --> 17:56.407
but I couldn't remember
what it was called.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.675
- I don't know.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.677
- Sure you won't stay?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.179
- Stop, I have to go.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.580
- Just for a little while?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.614
- Let go of me!

18:06.452 --> 18:08.453
- And here's
our little genius now.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.421
Mara, this is Kat.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.622
Kat, this is Mara.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.326
- Oh, sorry.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.528
Nice to meet you.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.363
- Yea, she just
hired us to do some

18:19.365 --> 18:21.365
mermaids for her for
a little project.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.867
Very sexy mermaids.

18:23.469 --> 18:24.936
- Sirens actually.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.471
It's a film about
modern day pirates

18:26.473 --> 18:28.272
who steal from the wrong ship,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.641
and summon these
bloodthirsty sirens.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.977
It sounds really dumb
when I explain it.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.613
- No, it sounds like
it's going to be

18:35.615 --> 18:37.315
really fun to work on.

18:37.816 --> 18:38.749
Let me grab my sketchbook,

18:38.751 --> 18:40.284
and we can go over some ideas.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.320
- Are you sure you're not busy?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.188
- No, I'm finished
with this, so.

18:44.389 --> 18:45.356
I'm all yours.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.259
- Well, then I'll be on my way,

18:48.261 --> 18:49.961
I guess just find me later,

18:49.963 --> 18:51.195
and we'll go over the paperwork.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.263
- Yea.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.165
- Alright, you two have fun.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.368
- Let's go over here.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.142
Like this?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.245
- Is there a way to make
them more serpent-like?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.213
Like, I don't know,
add some scales?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.250
Oh, and bigger tits,
Sebastian likes them stacked.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.085
I know how he casts
his female roles.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.654
- Sure, hold on.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.356
I love it though,
don't think I don't.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.158
- Oh, I'm not insulted.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.360
It'll take us a minute to
get our brains in sync.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.829
- This is the first
film I've co-produced,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.497
and Sebastian is out of control,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.199
and I'm afraid
the whole thing is

19:28.201 --> 19:29.367
going to be garbage.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.870
- I can't comment on how
the film's going to be,

19:32.872 --> 19:35.173
but your sirens are
going to look awesome.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.644
- Well yea, can I take a picture

19:39.646 --> 19:40.878
and send it to Sebastian?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.180
- Oh, absolutely.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.682
- Oh god, I just
realized I have to get

19:44.684 --> 19:46.184
to the studio before
the guy leaves.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.085
Here is my number.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.289
Can you text me them
when you're finished?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.290
- Sure, no problem.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.090
- Thanks.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.020
Mara, over here!

21:00.125 --> 21:01.993
So glad you showed up.

21:02.794 --> 21:03.728
- Am I late?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.096
I thought you said 9:30.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.031
- I did, I just got here early.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.766
I'm neurotic about everything.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.603
It's pretty dead in here, huh?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.906
- Oh, I would really
know, I don't really

21:15.908 --> 21:17.108
get out that much.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.312
- I like your jacket,
where'd you get it?

21:23.048 --> 21:24.949
- A friend, I borrowed it.

21:25.717 --> 21:26.984
- What's your poison?

21:27.219 --> 21:29.153
- Whatever you're
having is fine.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.456
- Listen, I want
to thank you for

21:32.458 --> 21:34.158
diving into the work so quickly.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.126
It means a lot to me.

21:36.061 --> 21:36.994
- It's not a problem.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.296
I'm really enjoying it.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.233
- Thank you.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.301
Ready?

21:46.071 --> 21:47.972
To sexy sea creatures.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.007
- To sexy sea creatures.

22:01.019 --> 22:01.952
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

22:01.954 --> 22:03.220
Let's take a selfie!

22:06.925 --> 22:08.526
I think they're kicking us out.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.927
- Oh my god.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.663
It is so darn hot in here.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.198
- I live right
around the corner,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.334
if you want to
crash at my place.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.236
- Yea, I probably
shouldn't drive.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.505
- Come on, let's go.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.609
Woah!

22:26.311 --> 22:27.178
- You okay?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.779
- Yea, so here's my place.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.182
It's not much, but
it's less to clean.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.385
- Oh, it's cute, it's homey.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.822
- Code word for
small, but whatever.

22:37.824 --> 22:38.723
Are you tired now?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.024
'Cause I am wired!

22:40.026 --> 22:41.125
You feel like watching a movie?

22:41.127 --> 22:42.860
- Yea, that sounds great.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.030
- Alright, I have a ridiculous
movie collection in here.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.407
Sit here.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.050
- What are you looking at?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.254
Everything okay?

23:12.657 --> 23:14.925
- Everything is perfect.

23:20.499 --> 23:23.334
I'm sorry, I didn't ask
you if you like girls.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.505
- Uh, I don't usually.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.107
I like you though.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.078
- I like you too.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.851
Like, I really like you.

23:43.455 --> 23:44.855
Like a lot.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.595
- So pretty.

23:53.064 --> 23:54.098
Isn't this fun?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.441
Oops, sorry.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.072
- Hey I wanted to
apologize if I was

24:35.074 --> 24:36.273
a prick the other night.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.842
I hope I didn't
seem too annoyed.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.977
I was so exhausted.

24:40.345 --> 24:44.114
- No, no, it was my fault
for playing my music so loud.

24:44.116 --> 24:44.949
I'm sorry.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.183
- No hard feelings?

24:46.852 --> 24:49.386
- Oh, of course not, thank you.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.057
- Well anyway, I'll let
you get back to your night.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.693
- Hey, how was that audition?

24:56.261 --> 24:58.462
- I think I killed it, but...

24:58.464 --> 25:00.097
I don't know.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.601
Half the people were busy
on their cell phones, so.

25:04.202 --> 25:05.236
- Sorry to hear.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.538
- Eh, it's cool.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.973
If it's for some
dumb pilot anyway,

25:08.975 --> 25:10.241
it'll probably
never get picked up.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.677
- Still, that must
have been frustrating.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.346
- I'm used to it by now.

25:15.947 --> 25:19.216
Hey, I ordered way
too much Chinese food,

25:19.218 --> 25:20.584
and it should be
here any minute.

25:21.119 --> 25:22.453
Hungry?

25:22.721 --> 25:25.322
- No, I mean, the last
time I got Chinese,

25:25.324 --> 25:26.757
it made me ill.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.225
- Maybe some other time?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.060
What kind of food do you like?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.429
Just in case I ever
order too much again.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.734
- I'm a vegetarian,
so no meat or dairy.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.402
I have an allergy.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.137
- Making a mental note.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.072
Okay, how about tomorrow?

25:42.074 --> 25:43.307
I'm Karl by the way.

25:43.642 --> 25:45.376
- You told me already.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.310
I'm Mara.

25:46.645 --> 25:47.711
My name's Mara.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.480
Sure, tomorrow sounds great.

25:49.915 --> 25:50.814
- Excellent.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.550
'Till tomorrow Mara,

25:52.552 --> 25:54.151
um, say six?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.153
- Sure, see you then.

26:14.940 --> 26:15.973
What?

26:17.342 --> 26:18.943
Don't look at me like that.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.244
He was only being nice.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.182
Stop it.

26:25.383 --> 26:26.517
I was not!

26:27.252 --> 26:28.986
I wasn't flirting!

26:30.355 --> 26:31.789
Don't do this to me!

26:31.791 --> 26:33.223
You and I were having
such a good night!

26:35.294 --> 26:36.360
Stop saying that!

26:36.928 --> 26:38.128
I'm not!

26:38.130 --> 26:39.697
I wasn't like that!

26:42.201 --> 26:44.301
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!

26:45.904 --> 26:48.606
I didn't do anything wrong!

26:49.240 --> 26:51.408
I was going to wait and
text you some pictures,

26:51.410 --> 26:53.210
but since you're here,

26:53.878 --> 26:55.412
I will show you.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.614
- I can't wait to see it!

26:57.248 --> 26:58.048
- Alright.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.216
Open.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.786
- Oh wow, that's beautiful.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.391
- Thanks.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.759
It'll look a lot better
when it's put together,

27:08.761 --> 27:10.728
but um, you know.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.297
- I can't believe you
got this done so fast.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.567
- Well I work really fast
when it's something I'm into.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.535
And I'm super into this.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.171
- Well thank you for
bringing my vision to life.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.207
- My pleasure.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.210
- Do you have a break soon?

27:27.112 --> 27:28.779
If I don't get an iced
latte in my system,

27:28.781 --> 27:30.347
I'm going to crash.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.915
- Um...

27:33.284 --> 27:35.185
I don't know, I still
have a lot of work to do.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.054
- It's on me.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.356
- Okay, I guess I can
take a few minutes.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.391
- Cool.

27:43.261 --> 27:45.362
The way you left
the other morning,

27:45.797 --> 27:47.498
I thought I blew it with you.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.668
- Sorry about that, I overslept.

27:51.302 --> 27:52.336
I didn't mean to be rude.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.605
- It's okay, I was
so out of it anyway.

27:54.607 --> 27:56.240
I had so much to drink.

27:56.775 --> 27:57.841
I hope I didn't
embarrass myself,

27:57.843 --> 27:59.510
I don't normally
drink that much.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.747
- Me neither,
especially whiskey.

28:05.216 --> 28:06.884
- There was a lot of
things I did last night

28:06.886 --> 28:08.585
that I don't normally do.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.922
I just wanted to
kiss you, and then...

28:16.161 --> 28:17.961
It got pretty intense.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.298
I'm just glad i
didn't scare you off.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.735
- I don't frighten easily.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.205
- Yea, I get that about you.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.408
You're very hard to read,
you're very mysterious.

28:32.243 --> 28:33.711
- No mystery here.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.280
I'm just quiet, shy I guess.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.515
- You don't need to be with me,

28:38.517 --> 28:40.117
I don't judge.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.420
I know you said you don't
normally like girls, but...

28:43.988 --> 28:46.323
Last night couldn't have
been your first time.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.593
- No, it's just been a while.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.395
- Yea.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.230
I haven't been with
someone in a long time.

28:53.932 --> 28:57.134
I used to date this dude on
and off for years, and...

28:58.336 --> 28:59.837
He was a real dirt bag.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.972
You know, I'm really
glad he's out of my life.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.340
Do you mind if we take a seat?

29:03.342 --> 29:05.175
My feet are killing me.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.512
I haven't worn these
heels in months.

29:09.781 --> 29:12.116
- 20 bucks, and super comfy.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.753
- You're adorable.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.355
What are you doing tonight?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.023
There's this screening
i have to go to,

29:20.025 --> 29:21.358
but I'll be out by 10.

29:22.127 --> 29:23.193
And I was thinking
maybe you could

29:23.195 --> 29:25.095
some over for a
late night snack?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.764
There's great takeout nearby.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.266
- Sure, I'd love that.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.239
- Hey.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.274
- Oh, fuck.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.410
We had plans, I totally forgot.

30:47.145 --> 30:48.512
God...

30:48.780 --> 30:50.547
I had a day from hell,
and now I have to go

30:50.549 --> 30:52.115
to this work thing.

30:52.717 --> 30:56.053
I am so sorry, I feel terrible.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.121
- Yea, well it's cool.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.356
You know, whatever.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.192
- No, no I was really
looking forward to it.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.295
How about another day next week?

31:05.563 --> 31:07.197
I'll make it up
to you, I promise.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.699
- Look, don't even
worry about it, alright?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.368
I'm tired anyways.

31:12.136 --> 31:13.704
I'll see you around, okay?

31:22.647 --> 31:24.414
- And then the aliens take off,

31:24.416 --> 31:26.283
and she screams,

31:27.018 --> 31:29.386
"take me, take me instead!"

31:29.388 --> 31:31.889
And she fires a
shotgun into the sky,

31:31.891 --> 31:33.523
like as if the alien
on the space ship

31:33.525 --> 31:35.225
is going to hear it and,

31:35.927 --> 31:38.795
they do, and they come
back and abduct her too.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.264
And then she gets
on the spaceship,

31:40.266 --> 31:42.099
and she sees her boyfriend, and

31:42.101 --> 31:45.102
he's this half human,
half alien hybrid.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.337
And she tries to
save him, and...

31:48.506 --> 31:50.474
Blah, blah, blah.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.244
Am I boring you?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.914
- No, it sounds fascinating.

31:58.216 --> 31:59.283
- Fascinating?

31:59.684 --> 32:01.084
Not by a long shot.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.053
But the audience
seemed to like it,

32:03.055 --> 32:04.421
so what do I know?

32:06.257 --> 32:08.792
- I used to have nightmares
about aliens as a kid.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.262
They'd come in and
just stand over my bed.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.331
I'd be paralyzed, so I couldn't

32:14.532 --> 32:17.935
yell or scream or move, and...

32:18.870 --> 32:20.871
They wouldn't touch
me or anything,

32:20.873 --> 32:21.972
or take me away.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.775
They'd just stare.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.779
- My sister, she had night
terrors until she was 14.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.081
She would wake up shrieking like

32:31.083 --> 32:32.616
two or three times a week.

32:33.484 --> 32:35.319
She used to sleep walk to.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.789
She almost fell down
the stairs once.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.557
- Wow.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.859
- Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

32:43.594 --> 32:44.895
- No.

32:44.897 --> 32:46.530
- Only children tend
to be introverts.

32:47.265 --> 32:50.734
That's probably why you're
so mysterious and sexy.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.804
Op, the food's here!

32:54.105 --> 32:55.739
You're going to love
this place, it's...

32:56.240 --> 32:57.674
I practically live off of it.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.276
I love to cook, but...

32:59.278 --> 33:00.344
Anyway, you'll love it.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.180
Thank you!

33:06.784 --> 33:08.518
Alright, I'm going
to go prepare it

33:08.520 --> 33:10.754
and make it look like i
made it for you myself.

33:11.155 --> 33:11.521
Bye.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.379
Alright, mild, medium, or spicy?

33:35.381 --> 33:37.514
- Oh, uh, medium's fine.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.448
- Okay.

33:45.890 --> 33:46.690
- No, not now!

33:50.728 --> 33:51.895
No, stop it!

33:52.663 --> 33:53.697
Shut up!

33:57.035 --> 33:58.268
No, I won't do it!

33:58.569 --> 33:59.803
No, not her!

34:00.204 --> 34:01.471
Oh god!

34:02.140 --> 34:03.306
I won't do that to her!

34:05.143 --> 34:07.044
Um I got to go!

34:07.046 --> 34:08.145
I...

34:08.147 --> 34:09.379
Forgot to take my meds!

34:10.081 --> 34:11.415
I got to go!

35:41.305 --> 35:42.372
- So you coming up?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.407
- I can't.

35:44.409 --> 35:45.976
You know I have
that thing tomorrow.

35:47.845 --> 35:48.645
- Whatever.

35:49.113 --> 35:50.080
- Give me a kiss.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.182
- It might taste like your cum.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.083
- I don't care.

36:01.192 --> 36:01.992
Tomorrow?

36:01.994 --> 36:02.926
- Holy fuck!

36:10.000 --> 36:20.178
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.178 --> 36:21.077
Hey!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.077 --> 36:21.445
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.445 --> 36:22.000
Open up!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:22.379
Open up!

36:25.349 --> 36:26.449
Let me in!

36:47.238 --> 36:48.638
- Sorry about last night.

36:51.409 --> 36:52.876
I have these pills
i need to take,

36:52.878 --> 36:55.045
and if I don't, I go
through withdrawal.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.348
I was in such a
rush to come over,

36:58.350 --> 36:59.883
I must have forgot.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.154
- Come on.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.090
What are the pills for?

37:07.092 --> 37:08.158
- Migraines.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.694
I've had them ever
since I was a kid.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.997
They get so bad, sometimes
i can't even function.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.100
I'll be laid up in bed for days.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.503
- And the pills help?

37:21.405 --> 37:22.772
- For the most part.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.507
I mean, I've been
on them so long,

37:24.509 --> 37:26.276
I don't even really
know anymore.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.748
- These are beautiful.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.149
I'm going to go put
them in my room.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.618
If you want to join me?

37:36.053 --> 37:37.287
- Sure.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.304
- Hey.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.339
Do you want to tie me up?

37:59.577 --> 38:00.810
- What?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.646
- Come on, let's
get a little freaky.

38:06.384 --> 38:07.317
- Okay.

38:17.828 --> 38:18.728
- Tighter.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.683
Hey.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.652
Do you want to take
it to the next level?

38:44.922 --> 38:46.723
What did you have in mind?

38:48.125 --> 38:49.526
- Well...

38:50.194 --> 38:52.395
I have a knife on the
bookshelf over there.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.532
You can run it over my body.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.440
Not too rough or anything.

39:06.377 --> 39:07.911
- Are you sure?

39:08.612 --> 39:09.679
- Yea.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.182
I trust you.

39:19.557 --> 39:20.523
Yea.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.626
You can be a little rougher.

39:55.926 --> 39:57.160
Yea, like that.

40:30.094 --> 40:34.164
So, when am I going to
get to see your place?

40:35.065 --> 40:36.332
- I don't know.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.635
- Don't be embarrassed.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.271
It couldn't possibly
be as ghetto as mine.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.206
- It's not that.

40:44.542 --> 40:45.608
It's...

40:45.610 --> 40:47.043
Just always such a mess.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.512
I'm never home to clean.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.848
- Messier than here?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.718
You know, I'm starting to
think you're hiding something.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.521
You don't have a
girlfriend, right?

40:59.056 --> 41:00.089
- No.

41:00.091 --> 41:03.126
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

41:03.994 --> 41:05.628
- Then what's the problem?

41:06.230 --> 41:07.630
I want to see your place.

41:08.065 --> 41:09.365
I want to see where you live.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.202
I could help you clean.

41:12.736 --> 41:14.003
It'd be fun.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.638
Like a quest.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.308
- You don't have to do that.

41:19.243 --> 41:20.176
- Fine.

41:20.411 --> 41:21.711
I won't.

41:22.246 --> 41:25.315
I just don't get why
you never take me home.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.553
- I will, I promise.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.490
Next time I have a
day off, I'll clean

41:33.492 --> 41:35.391
and I promise you can come over.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.595
I'll make us dinner
or something.

41:40.698 --> 41:41.931
- I'd love that.

41:44.134 --> 41:45.668
Sorry for being weird.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.606
The last person I dated
was a real scum bag.

41:50.641 --> 41:54.410
So I'm overly cautious
when it comes to my heart.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.081
- I understand.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.238
Oh, perfect.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.576
- Here, let me help.

42:27.678 --> 42:28.811
- It's fine, I got it.

42:28.813 --> 42:29.946
- Oh, it's no bother.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.381
- I said,

42:31.383 --> 42:32.382
I got it.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.450
- Karl, she said she's fine.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.253
- Have a good night Mara.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.339
- Stop it, stop it!

42:58.742 --> 43:00.143
Get off of her!

43:01.078 --> 43:02.345
- What's the matter,
are you jealous?

43:02.846 --> 43:04.113
- Don't be jealous.

43:04.882 --> 43:05.848
Join us.

43:05.850 --> 43:07.083
- Yea, join us.

43:07.384 --> 43:08.952
- Why don't you call kitty Kat?

43:09.286 --> 43:10.587
Have her come play with us?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.256
How do you think she tastes?

43:13.757 --> 43:15.291
- Like juicy watermelon.

43:15.926 --> 43:18.061
- Stop it, shut up!

43:18.063 --> 43:19.529
Stop it, shut up!

43:19.531 --> 43:21.297
Stop it, stop it!

45:07.237 --> 45:08.271
- Are you okay?

45:09.139 --> 45:10.573
- Everything's fucking peaches.

45:10.575 --> 45:12.375
That's why I'm alone in
the middle of the night

45:12.377 --> 45:14.310
in this shit hole
of a neighborhood.

45:16.313 --> 45:17.280
- Where are you headed?

45:17.915 --> 45:18.715
- Home.

45:19.817 --> 45:21.150
- I figured that.

45:21.652 --> 45:22.752
I can give you a ride.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.656
It's no trouble, get in.

45:27.891 --> 45:28.991
- I guess.

45:32.029 --> 45:33.863
Hey, you sure you don't mind?

45:33.865 --> 45:35.164
I am kind of far from here.

45:36.533 --> 45:39.102
- I'm in no rush to get
back to my empty apartment.

45:40.270 --> 45:42.638
- Sorry if I was taut
back there before.

45:43.507 --> 45:46.142
Tonight's been a night
from absolute hell.

45:48.612 --> 45:50.313
Fucking online dating!

45:51.348 --> 45:53.683
Everyone on there's
a total creep.

45:55.853 --> 45:58.020
Of course, the first date,

45:58.022 --> 45:59.655
he was a complete gentleman.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.692
Didn't even go in
for a goodnight kiss.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.094
Tonight though,

46:05.429 --> 46:07.196
oh my fucking Christ.

46:08.031 --> 46:09.665
You wouldn't fucking believe it.

46:12.236 --> 46:13.469
They're all the same.

46:13.704 --> 46:16.539
They think they can
take you out and

46:16.541 --> 46:19.342
woo you with an
expensive bottle of wine.

46:20.577 --> 46:22.245
Then you're supposed
to suck them off

46:22.247 --> 46:24.881
in the back of the cab like
you owe them something.

46:27.151 --> 46:28.151
Do you know what
this one said to me?

46:29.486 --> 46:32.655
He goes, "I'll give you
$200 if you blow me baby."

46:33.457 --> 46:35.992
I was like, "listen
buddy, I ain't getting

46:35.994 --> 46:39.028
"anywhere near your
inchworm of a cock, okay?"

46:39.563 --> 46:41.697
"Not even for a
million dollars."

46:42.132 --> 46:45.401
Especially not with some
shady cab driver watching.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.270
Oh, turn here.

46:50.407 --> 46:51.874
Screw them.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.244
Every last one of them.

47:04.488 --> 47:07.023
Oh, this is it right here.

47:08.192 --> 47:09.492
Just pull in, it's okay.

47:20.103 --> 47:21.270
Hey.

47:21.772 --> 47:23.339
Thanks so much.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.175
I don't know what I would
have done back there.

47:27.177 --> 47:29.645
Probably could have
gotten mugged, or,

47:29.647 --> 47:31.781
raped or, who knows what?

47:32.649 --> 47:34.617
You think there's be
more cabs at this hour,

47:34.619 --> 47:37.019
I mean, it's not that late.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.288
Well, anyway.

47:39.489 --> 47:41.057
It was real nice to meet you.

47:41.059 --> 47:42.291
I'm Vera, by the way.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.559
- I'm...

47:46.331 --> 47:48.231
- Oh my god!

47:48.632 --> 47:50.132
What's wrong?

47:50.667 --> 47:51.901
- I don't know.

47:51.903 --> 47:52.802
All of a sudden I just.

47:53.638 --> 47:55.238
- Holy shit!

48:01.678 --> 48:02.745
Um...

48:02.747 --> 48:04.547
I think you better come inside.

48:04.549 --> 48:07.617
I'll get you some water or
some ibuprofen or something.

48:08.085 --> 48:10.820
- No, no I need to get home.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.923
- Please, I insist.

48:13.925 --> 48:15.925
You're in no condition to drive.

48:38.882 --> 48:39.949
Here you go.

48:40.350 --> 48:41.317
- Thank you.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.119
- I was really worried about you

48:43.121 --> 48:44.453
for a second back there.

48:44.455 --> 48:46.322
You were practically green.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.591
- I feel much better now.

48:49.359 --> 48:50.960
Must have been something I ate.

48:51.862 --> 48:53.696
- Well, I need to
go get changed.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.131
This michale kors
looked way more

48:55.133 --> 48:56.866
comfortable on the mannequin.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.601
I'll be back in a bit.

49:08.578 --> 49:09.445
You're more than welcome to

49:09.447 --> 49:11.314
hang out here if you like.

49:11.316 --> 49:12.782
I just can't chill
with you tonight,

49:12.784 --> 49:15.318
because I have to be up at 7:00.

49:18.588 --> 49:21.824
Well, listen, you could just
hang until you feel better.

49:21.826 --> 49:22.658
Just make sure you lock up

49:22.660 --> 49:24.160
on your way out, okay?

49:39.309 --> 49:40.810
- I appreciate that,

49:41.778 --> 49:43.312
but I have to go home.

49:44.181 --> 49:45.414
I have pets.

49:45.949 --> 49:47.750
- Oh, I understand.

49:48.151 --> 49:49.485
I had chihuahuas once.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.821
Cute little things.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.122
You leave them
alone for more than

49:53.124 --> 49:54.557
three hours, they shit
all over the carpet.

49:56.093 --> 49:57.360
- Thanks for the water.

49:58.295 --> 49:59.528
I'll see you around.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.330
- Drive safe.

50:15.312 --> 50:17.380
Oh shit, she left her phone.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.382
Hey, you left your
phone, hold on!

51:36.726 --> 51:38.127
- Pretty girl.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.292
- This is amazing, right?

52:43.294 --> 52:44.627
- Oh, they're so cute!

52:44.629 --> 52:46.428
- Cute and bloody,
just the way I like.

52:47.598 --> 52:48.531
- Oh hey!

52:49.032 --> 52:50.833
I was going to stop by and,

52:50.835 --> 52:53.369
say hi, but Bobby said
you were busy, so.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.037
- What are you guys watching?

52:55.039 --> 52:57.339
- It's this horror movie
about killer rabbits.

52:57.341 --> 52:58.374
Have you seen it?

52:58.376 --> 52:59.408
- No I haven't.

53:00.143 --> 53:01.277
- It's really far out there.

53:01.279 --> 53:02.811
- If you think this
is far out there,

53:02.813 --> 53:04.346
you've got to come to
my place some time.

53:04.348 --> 53:07.149
I have literally a
whole wall of vhs stuff.

53:07.151 --> 53:08.784
I mean, shit you'll never see,

53:08.786 --> 53:10.553
everything from exploitation, to

53:10.555 --> 53:11.954
creature features.

53:11.956 --> 53:14.523
If it was made
between 1970 and 1989,

53:14.525 --> 53:15.891
I most likely have it.

53:16.293 --> 53:18.227
- I love that stuff!

53:18.395 --> 53:20.196
- Well, how about tonight?

53:20.198 --> 53:21.463
I mean, Mara, you're
more than welcome

53:21.465 --> 53:22.164
to join us.

53:22.166 --> 53:23.499
- What do you say?

53:23.501 --> 53:25.734
- I can't, I have a ton
of stuff I have to do.

53:26.836 --> 53:28.170
- She never wants to come out.

53:28.172 --> 53:29.538
Always so busy.

53:31.007 --> 53:32.808
- It's cool, I'll
see you guys later.

53:32.810 --> 53:33.542
- You sure?

53:34.511 --> 53:35.477
Boo.

53:36.479 --> 53:38.080
- More bloody bunnies for us.

53:42.185 --> 53:43.052
- There you go.

53:43.253 --> 53:44.320
- Thanks.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.224
- Hey there.

53:48.992 --> 53:49.959
- Hey.

53:50.193 --> 53:51.193
- What's a pretty girl like you

53:51.195 --> 53:52.962
doing here all by yourself?

53:53.196 --> 53:54.330
- Got stood up.

53:55.198 --> 53:56.432
- Must have been a blind date.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.702
'Cause anybody that's
seen your face,

53:59.704 --> 54:02.738
standing you up, is either blind

54:02.740 --> 54:04.173
or a fucking idiot.

54:04.175 --> 54:05.941
Why don't you let
me buy you a drink?

54:06.343 --> 54:07.309
- I really shouldn't.

54:08.445 --> 54:09.612
- Oh come on.

54:09.879 --> 54:11.080
Just one more.

54:11.082 --> 54:11.981
It's on me.

54:12.782 --> 54:13.949
- If you insist.

54:15.118 --> 54:16.418
- Alright.

54:20.056 --> 54:21.557
Can she have another drink?

54:21.559 --> 54:22.424
- Yea.

54:22.426 --> 54:23.525
- This is on me this time.

54:32.569 --> 54:33.802
- Thank you.

54:38.808 --> 54:40.109
You know?

54:41.111 --> 54:43.212
I never had sex
in a motel before.

54:44.047 --> 54:46.148
Wait, I lied.

54:46.716 --> 54:48.550
But that was more like a hotel.

54:52.889 --> 54:53.989
What do you think?

54:54.557 --> 54:55.791
Should we get a little,

54:56.594 --> 54:57.793
kinky?

55:03.300 --> 55:04.566
What do you think of this one?

55:06.404 --> 55:07.836
I agree.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.575
Oh stop.

55:13.577 --> 55:15.411
It can't hurt that bad.

55:27.090 --> 55:28.357
Don't worry.

55:28.692 --> 55:30.693
I'm not going to
cut anything off.

55:31.795 --> 55:33.195
You're a married man.

55:34.464 --> 55:36.198
I'm going to send you
home in one piece.

55:40.870 --> 55:42.171
What's the matter?

55:42.806 --> 55:44.540
I thought this was
what you wanted.

55:45.608 --> 55:49.178
Oh wait, you wanted to fuck me.

55:50.046 --> 55:51.213
Sorry.

55:52.048 --> 55:53.282
Me first.

56:10.867 --> 56:12.034
- See?

56:12.036 --> 56:13.035
This is what I was
telling you about.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.069
Isn't it great?

56:14.071 --> 56:15.337
- Looks good.

56:15.339 --> 56:16.572
- Don't mind him, he
wouldn't get excited

56:16.574 --> 56:18.307
if his cock was on fire.

56:18.309 --> 56:19.942
- I said it fucking looks good.

56:20.343 --> 56:22.378
- Well, I love it
Mara, you know I do.

56:22.979 --> 56:23.712
- Thanks.

56:23.714 --> 56:24.780
- I got to take this.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.949
- What's with him?

56:27.150 --> 56:28.484
You know, he's the
douche bag type,

56:28.486 --> 56:30.152
but not the rude kind, you know?

56:30.154 --> 56:32.154
More like a younger
brother, except older.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.423
- He's really
nothing compared to

56:34.425 --> 56:36.258
most of the producers
I've had to deal with.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.394
At least he's letting
you take charge.

56:38.928 --> 56:41.964
- That he is, because he
can't make a decision.

56:42.198 --> 56:43.832
Except for when it
comes to female nudity,

56:43.834 --> 56:45.801
and then it's more, more, more.

56:46.236 --> 56:49.238
- Sounds like every
guy in this industry.

56:50.607 --> 56:51.907
- More or less.

56:52.275 --> 56:53.742
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

56:53.943 --> 56:55.377
A bunch of us are going
to my friend Stephen's

56:55.379 --> 56:57.880
to watch this short
he shot last month

56:57.882 --> 57:00.149
and I'd love for you
to meet everybody.

57:00.683 --> 57:02.584
- I can't, I have
to work super late.

57:02.852 --> 57:04.119
- 'Till when?

57:04.121 --> 57:05.821
I'm sure we can
show up whenever.

57:06.022 --> 57:08.457
He'll be showing it over
and over and over again.

57:08.792 --> 57:09.792
- I don't know.

57:10.059 --> 57:11.326
- Come on, please?

57:13.296 --> 57:15.864
Okay, I can be ready by 10:00?

57:17.066 --> 57:18.233
- Okay, I'll pick you up.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.268
Yay, I'm so excited!

57:20.303 --> 57:21.270
- Oh no, you don't
have to do that,

57:21.272 --> 57:22.337
I'll meet you there.

57:23.206 --> 57:24.373
- I don't mind waiting.

57:24.908 --> 57:26.074
- No, really.

57:26.076 --> 57:27.309
Then I'll feel like
i have to rush,

57:27.311 --> 57:29.011
and I really don't
want to screw up.

57:30.246 --> 57:31.547
- Promise you won't bail?

57:32.115 --> 57:33.382
- I promise.

57:34.217 --> 57:36.185
- Okay, I'll text
you the address.

57:47.497 --> 57:48.897
Thanks so much for hanging out

57:48.899 --> 57:50.332
with my friends tonight.

57:51.267 --> 57:53.168
- They were funny,
and everyone was

57:53.170 --> 57:54.503
really nice to me.

57:55.104 --> 57:57.439
- They're obnoxious,
very obnoxious,

57:57.441 --> 58:00.075
but they're harmless,
and thanks again.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.778
- I had fun, really.

58:02.780 --> 58:03.812
I did.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.214
- So...

58:05.582 --> 58:07.382
When am I going to get
to meet your friends?

58:08.485 --> 58:09.518
- I...

58:09.520 --> 58:11.186
Don't really have any.

58:11.855 --> 58:14.590
I mean, I work so much, i
just never have the time.

58:16.426 --> 58:17.926
- You must have some friends.

58:19.095 --> 58:20.329
- No, really.

58:20.964 --> 58:24.199
I don't, I mean,
i used to, but...

58:24.501 --> 58:26.168
I lost touch with everyone.

58:27.604 --> 58:28.804
- For real?

58:28.806 --> 58:30.706
You're not embarrassed
of me, are you?

58:30.974 --> 58:32.941
- No, of course not.

58:34.544 --> 58:35.911
I work, and I come home.

58:36.145 --> 58:38.180
And I draw, and
then I go to sleep.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.381
That's my life.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.118
I used to have a pet rat.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.187
But, he died.

58:46.289 --> 58:47.589
- You know,

58:47.957 --> 58:50.225
maybe we can just
get you a pet cat.

58:51.127 --> 58:53.195
- I think I already have one.

59:42.845 --> 59:43.745
Out.

59:44.714 --> 59:46.281
Get out.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.567
- Why did you keep
me locked in here

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:08.170
for so long?

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.006
- How could you do this to us?

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.942
- I had no choice.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.978
You made me.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:22.818
- No, I loved you!

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:25.320
I loved you!

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:27.322
- You were going to
throw me in the trash

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.490
like you were the others.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:30.292
- It wasn't like
that, don't say that!

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:39.701
- Is that what I am to you?

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.170
Human fucking garbage!

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.642
- Don't say that, it's not true!

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.347
- I'm not going to
let you do this to us.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:57.586
- You stayed out
again last night.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:01.356
You never came home.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.826
I'm not going to
let you leave again.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:09.531
Never, ever, ever, ever!

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.276
- I brought soup!

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:30.612
- What, huh?

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.714
- Bobby said you
were deathly ill,

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:34.249
you never returned by texts,

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.352
so I thought I'd play nurse, but

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.254
no sexy outfit
'cause I figured you

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.956
wouldn't want to get frisky.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.060
Oh, what is that smell?

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:46.795
Is your garbage
disposal backed up?

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.265
- You can't be here.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.701
- Don't worry, i
overdosed on vitamins

01:02:52.703 --> 01:02:54.603
before I got here,
so I wont get sick.

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:57.072
And I have the
constitution of iron man.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:59.307
- I mean it, you can't
be here, get out!

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:00.475
Now!

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.977
- I'm sorry i
unannounced,

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.979
but I was worried!

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.781
- Get out of here!

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:07.749
Get out!

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:09.117
- What's gotten into you?

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.554
- Look, this was fun,
but it's over, okay?

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:15.223
I never want to see you again!

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.561
It's over, now go!

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:46.922
Fuck!

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.448
- I can see why you
like her so much.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.551
She's not rotting like me.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.186
- Not rotting like us.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.623
- I was pretty
once, just like her.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.793
Now I'm hideous!

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.196
You made me ugly!

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.265
- You made us ugly.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.536
- I want to make you ugly.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:40.375
That way, no one
will ever love you.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.577
- That way, she'll
never love you.

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.480
- I got rid of her.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.783
What more do you want?

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.620
- I want what you owe me!

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.655
- What you owe us.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.727
- I'm sorry.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.297
I didn't mean for anything.

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:05.333
It just happened.

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.370
- It just happened?

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:15.477
Oh, what's the matter?

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:18.179
Don't you want to
get a little freaky?

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:23.752
- I'll never stray again!

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.288
I promise!

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.123
Oh, you promise?

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.025
She promises.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.160
- It's a little
too late for that.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.264
What do you say we shut that
pretty little mouth first?

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:40.302
- No, no, no, no!

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:41.770
No, no, no!

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.138
No!

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.306
No!

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:45.106
- That's better.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:46.775
- Much better.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.677
Let's make her bleed.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.212
Let's make her bleed like us!

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.515
That way we can
keep her forever.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:44.666
Bitch!

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.344
- Going on a trip or something?

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:30.278
- Huh?

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.414
- The luggage.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.415
Vacation?

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.984
- No, it's for work.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:37.986
- But it's so late!

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.321
What do you do, are you
a doctor or something?

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.624
- Or something.

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:46.428
- Here.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:47.829
Let me help you.

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:54.502
Just, push it all the way back.

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.104
There's no space back here.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.042
- Kat are you home?

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:04.145
Kat, I just want to talk.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.981
- What are you doing here?

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.317
- I'm sorry for how
I've been acting.

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.352
I've been crazy, I know.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:15.256
I wasn't feeling well
before, I was very sick,

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.758
I'm going through
a lot of drama.

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.827
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:20.962
- It's cool.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:23.098
Listen, can we talk
about this tomorrow?

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:25.300
- Yea, sure.

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.435
I just wanted to
tell you I was sorry.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:32.040
And I, couldn't wait
to tell you how I feel.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.777
I love you.

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.313
- Are you drunk?

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.216
Look, that's sweet.

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:43.984
But now is not the best time.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.621
Can I text you tomorrow?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.689
- Who's that?

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:49.691
- It's just a friend.

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.296
- Oh.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.198
You have company.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.236
That was fast.

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.703
- She's cute.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.673
Why don't you ask
her to play with us?

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.477
- Apologies, I thought
we were over, you

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.812
kicked me out of your
house and told me

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.380
you never wanted
to see me again.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.350
What did you expect?

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:17.752
- Nothing.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.354
I expected nothing.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.725
- You sure you won't join us?

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:32.901
What's her problem?

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.269
I can hear you you asshole!

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.542
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.143
What the fuck?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.558
- Answer!

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.631
What are you looking at?

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:39.901
I know!

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:41.970
Fucked everything up!

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:46.874
Ugh!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.411
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.252
Stop judging me!

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.189
Nothing's going to.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260
What,

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.294
do I have,

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:07.528
to do?

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:17.772
Will this make you happy?

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.276
Is this what you want?

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:26.180
If I die, who's going
to take care of you?

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.182
No one!

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:32.153
I'm all you have!

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:49.904
Jesus Christ.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.008
- Look, you mind taking
a break for an hour?

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.810
I've been at the
hospital all day.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:56.844
- The hospital?

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.446
- Yea, Jasmine, you didn't hear?

01:11:58.448 --> 01:11:59.747
The cops didn't talk to you?

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.316
- About what?

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.250
- Jasmine!

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.851
Someone assaulted her!

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.888
- Oh my god, that's terrible.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.990
Do they know who did it?

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.192
- Not yet, she hasn't been
able to talk or anything.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.828
Who ever did it though
fucked her up real hardcore.

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.998
- Wow, I've always felt so
safe in this neighborhood,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.100
I can't imagine
getting attacked here.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.668
- How did you know
it happened here?

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:25.640
- I didn't, you asked if
the cops had talked to me,

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:28.543
so I just assumed
that it happened here.

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:29.711
- Yea, okay, okay.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:30.978
Listen, I'm kind
of fried right now.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.181
My head's all over
the place, okay?

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.850
- Of course Karl, I understand.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.952
If there's anything I can do,

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:39.020
please let me know.

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.321
- You're bleeding.

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:41.522
- What?

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.391
Oh, no, that's paint.

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:45.226
I was painting.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:48.062
- That's right, you,
okay, you're an artist.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:49.464
Okay.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:51.332
I'm going to go take
that nap now okay?

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:52.567
If you could keep the volume at

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:54.335
three or below for
an hour, my brain

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:55.336
would appreciate it.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:56.771
- Of course, of course.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:24.766
Damn it!

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.478
Hi, Kat?

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.182
Please.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.851
Don't hang up.

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.253
I...

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:55.923
I'm really bugging out here.

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:59.393
I don't know what to do.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:03.998
I'm scared I'm going
to hurt myself.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.904
I just took all these pills,
i don't know how many.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.543
I don't know where else to turn.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.747
Please, please come over.

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.718
Please.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.857
Okay.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:45.706
Come in.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.182
Thank you for coming,

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:57.251
I didn't know who else to call.

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.255
- Is this about the other night?

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.258
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.493
I was a real cunt.

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.596
- No, it's not that.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.532
Well, it's kind of that.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:15.269
I don't know, it's everything.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.442
- Is this about your new look?

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.678
'Cause that's not you.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.449
If it makes you feel any better,

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.318
that bitch never
returned my calls.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.187
- I meant what i
said the other night.

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.622
That I love you.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.258
I know that's insane, but I do.

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:40.294
I had some things i
needed to work out first.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.129
But that's done now.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.265
- Listen, I had
feelings too but,

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.600
I don't want to get
involved with you.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.034
I need stability, and you're

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.235
talking about hurting yourself?

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:49.537
I can't handle that.

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:53.207
- I have issues, I know that.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.177
But I'm working on them, see?

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:57.878
I let you in.

01:16:58.246 --> 01:16:59.814
You're in my house.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:04.085
- Listen Mara,
you're a real doll,

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:06.320
and I'm really
attracted to you, but

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:08.055
I don't see this working out.

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.291
- Please.

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:13.127
I have something i
need to show you.

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:15.563
Just give me five minutes,

01:17:15.565 --> 01:17:19.467
and I promise, I won't
ever bother you again.

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.636
- What is it?

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.704
- Come with me.

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:25.673
Close your eyes.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.710
Go ahead, trust me, close them.

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.146
- Okay.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.348
- Let's go.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.824
Okay, keep your eyes closed.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:44.825
- Alright.

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:47.194
- Just a few more steps.

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:50.498
- Can I open my eyes now?

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.234
- Okay.

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:54.969
Open!

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.447
- Oh my god, what did you do?

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.517
- I know I can't
compete with her.

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:14.221
She's so beautiful, so perfect.

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:17.091
I know you want
her more than me.

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.928
But now you don't
have to choose.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.032
- You're sick!

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:29.136
Oh my god, what
did you do to her!

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.238
- Do you love her?

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.708
Tell me the truth!

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:36.444
- Just let me go!

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:40.114
I won't tell, i
won't say anything!

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.284
- Say anything to who?

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:45.586
Don't you see?

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.389
You and I can be together.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.758
You,

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.359
me,

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.628
and your little friend here.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.164
- Stay back, I'll
hurt you, I swear!

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.067
- Hurt me?

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.570
Why would you hurt me?

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:04.805
I love you.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440
- No.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:10.411
- I gave up everything for you!

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.246
All of them!

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.181
They meant nothing!

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.217
- Help!

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:21.155
- Shh!

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:25.259
It was always you Kat.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.594
You.

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.296
Shh.

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:34.869
Everything is going
to be perfect.

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:37.037
Trust me.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:40.875
Your lips.

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:44.545
They're so soft!

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.515
I could kiss them forever.

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:52.186
Shh!

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.356
Shh, don't you want to kiss?

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:05.466
- Please stay the
fuck away from me!

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.669
- I'm okay.

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.173
Just look.

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:16.310
Just close your eyes,

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:18.479
and relax!

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.416
You bitch!

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.285
You bitch!

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.122
- Somebody help me!

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:30.424
Please, somebody, please!

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.261
She's a psycho killer!

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:36.197
She killed her, we have
to get out of here now!

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:37.264
- I'll call the police!

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:38.499
- No, there's no time!

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.467
Oh my god, no!

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.741
- It's just you and me now.

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.678
The way it was meant to be.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.012
- You won't get away with this!

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.687
- Better?

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.257
It's okay baby.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.293
Mara's here.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:10.097
Mara's going to
make it all better.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.434
We're going to be together...

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.703
Forever.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:32.319
I would kill for 10
more minutes of this.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.928
Thank you for coming back to me.

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.099
I love you.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.542
I love you.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.215
Goddammit, shit, motherfuckers,

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.650
get out of here!

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.419
God, fuck!

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.523
My Kat.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.526
I'll be right back.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.862
I love you.

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:27.308
Ow.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:28.375
Stupid.

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:32.980
Oh no!

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:36.917
Ms. Lucy!

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.191
No, stop!

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:45.392
No!

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.395
Get off of me!

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:50.331
No, stop!

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:52.232
No, no, no!

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:53.267
No!

01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:55.235
No wait, wait, no!

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:57.504
No!

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:58.906
No, no!

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.911
No!

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.415
- You
tried to get rid of us,

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:09.850
to replace us.

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.852
And now you're ours forever.

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:13.253
- We'll never let you go!

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:15.055
Never, ever let you go!

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.825
The way it was meant to be.

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:19.326
It's the way we
were meant to be.

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.196
- I'm sorry,
i never meant to

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.931
hurt any of you!

01:23:23.933 --> 01:23:26.200
- But you did hurt
us so fucking bad!

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:28.168
And we forgive you.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.937
- Was it worth it?

01:23:29.939 --> 01:23:31.271
Was she worth it?

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:32.806
I forgive you.

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:33.907
- We forgive you.

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.280
- Shh!

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.688
You're staying forever.
