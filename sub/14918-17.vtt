WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.842
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

00:04.842 --> 00:05.959
Wow.

00:05.959 --> 00:08.825
It's amazing, isn't it...

00:08.825 --> 00:13.617
how two little words can make our
lovemaking even more passionate?

00:13.617 --> 00:14.624
Oh, God.

00:14.624 --> 00:17.422
When I say, "don't stop,
" you really don't stop.

00:17.422 --> 00:19.290
Not those two words.

00:21.177 --> 00:22.374
Je t'aime.

00:22.724 --> 00:23.778
I love you, too.

00:23.778 --> 00:28.722
I can't believe that
in three weeks, two days

00:28.722 --> 00:29.825
and... what time is it?

00:29.825 --> 00:33.722
Oh! Eight hours, if you don't have a visa,

00:33.722 --> 00:34.991
you'll be on a plane to France.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.147
Stop calculating.

00:36.147 --> 00:38.951
We promised to live in the present.

00:38.951 --> 00:39.857
Ugh. I am, I am.

00:39.857 --> 00:41.324
And right now in the present,

00:41.324 --> 00:43.577
I'm upset that my government,

00:43.577 --> 00:45.601
to whom I pay taxes, by the way,

00:45.601 --> 00:50.751
is lurking in my bedroom
waiting to ruin my life.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.243
I love how you think.

00:52.243 --> 00:54.832
The entire government
is out there to get you.

00:54.832 --> 00:57.464
Well, this is a very big problem.

00:57.464 --> 00:58.758
You know what I think?

00:58.758 --> 00:59.778
What?

00:59.778 --> 01:03.014
I think the problems of two little people

01:03.014 --> 01:05.837
don't amount to hill of
beans in this crazy world.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.532
As adorable as you are,

01:07.532 --> 01:10.623
imitating Humphrey Bogart
with your little French accent,

01:10.623 --> 01:13.200
I don't think we should quote
from "Casablanca" anymore,

01:14.358 --> 01:16.443
because I know how it ends...

01:18.359 --> 01:21.142
Two people in tears

01:21.142 --> 01:22.709
in an airport...

01:22.709 --> 01:24.960
On a foggy night.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.407
Don't say anything.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:43.069 --> 01:45.518
Good morning, leisure man.

01:45.518 --> 01:47.517
Good morning, hunky breadwinner.

01:47.517 --> 01:48.678
And just so you know,

01:48.678 --> 01:50.507
I'm not gonna be leisure man forever.

01:50.507 --> 01:52.014
There are many exciting careers

01:52.014 --> 01:53.563
just waiting for someone like me.

01:53.563 --> 01:55.622
- Such as?
- Well, I don't know yet.

01:55.622 --> 01:58.118
I have to finish my
careers assessment test..

01:58.118 --> 02:01.922
"Of the following, which
activities most appeal to you?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.794
Working on mathematical problems." No.

02:04.794 --> 02:06.691
"Recording customer complaints." No.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.810
Ooh. "Teaching needy children overseas."

02:09.810 --> 02:11.229
Yes.

02:11.229 --> 02:13.645
Uh, "giving orders to others." Yes.

02:13.645 --> 02:15.680
Mm... yes.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.123
"Tapping maple trees for sugar." Why not?

02:19.123 --> 02:21.693
Ooh. "Giving legal advice.
" No. Did that. Hated it.

02:21.693 --> 02:22.549
Not a chance.

02:22.549 --> 02:24.686
"Designing lamps." Absolutely.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.165
Wow. "Planning a political campaign."

02:28.165 --> 02:30.159
Bite your tongue, you stupid test.

02:33.263 --> 02:35.005
Wait. Scotty, look at this.

02:35.005 --> 02:37.946
I'm not suited for anything.

02:37.946 --> 02:40.950
Well, what about lamps and maple syrup?

02:40.950 --> 02:43.877
The only things I am suited
for are law and politics,

02:43.877 --> 02:45.284
and I don't want to go back to that.

02:45.284 --> 02:47.403
- I'm a complete failure.
- Stop it, Kevin,

02:47.404 --> 02:49.230
you are not a failure.

02:49.231 --> 02:51.446
name one thing I'm good at.

02:51.446 --> 02:53.704
Well, you were pretty
good in bed last night.

02:53.704 --> 02:56.522
Yes, I was, wasn't...
hey, let's do that again.

02:56.522 --> 02:57.908
Oh, I... I... I can't.

02:57.908 --> 03:00.042
I have a breakfast meeting
at San Estephe with my boss,

03:00.042 --> 03:01.160
- so I... I...
- Oh, come on.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.906
Daytime sex is one of the
few perks of unemployment.

03:03.906 --> 03:06.465
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, but we have to be quick.

03:06.465 --> 03:09.572
Leisure man can be so
speedy when necessary.

03:11.123 --> 03:12.722
Ah! Don't answer that.

03:12.722 --> 03:13.655
The only people who call the landline

03:13.655 --> 03:15.271
are telemarketers and wrong number.

03:16.704 --> 03:17.988
What if it's my boss calling to cancel?

03:17.988 --> 03:19.933
Then maybe you should answer it.

03:22.993 --> 03:25.454
- Hello.
- Hi, Scotty. It's Sarah. Listen, um...

03:25.454 --> 03:27.176
Oh, yeah. Hi. Just a sec.

03:27.176 --> 03:28.899
It's Sarah.

03:28.899 --> 03:30.993
Why did...

03:32.404 --> 03:36.098
What kind of sneaky person
blocks their caller I.D.?

03:36.098 --> 03:37.804
Well, look, I'm in an emergency,

03:37.804 --> 03:40.617
and I didn't have time to play
your little voice mail game

03:40.617 --> 03:42.671
- so that you'd call me back.
- What emergency?

03:42.671 --> 03:47.822
Okay, listen, Kevin, you have got
to help Luc get his visa renewed.

03:47.822 --> 03:48.863
Come on. You're a lawyer.

03:48.863 --> 03:50.659
There's gotta be
something that you can do.

03:50.659 --> 03:53.227
Sarah, I'm not an
immigration lawyer, okay?

03:53.227 --> 03:56.090
I put a call in to the immigration
attorney at my old firm.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.231
That is all I can do.

03:57.231 --> 03:57.928
No, Kevin.

03:57.928 --> 03:59.599
There's got to be
something else you can do.

04:00.673 --> 04:01.547
Hello.

04:01.547 --> 04:02.464
Scotty, it's Kitty.

04:02.464 --> 04:06.372
- Hi, Kitty.
- She says it's an emergency.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.840
Hang on a
second. Kevin-1-1.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.845
What's your emergency?

04:09.845 --> 04:11.150
Very funny, Kevin. Look,

04:11.150 --> 04:12.981
I need you to go to a couple of campaign

04:12.981 --> 04:15.029
events with me today. Okay? Please.

04:15.029 --> 04:16.438
I am desperate.

04:16.438 --> 04:17.985
Kit, I do not work for you.

04:17.985 --> 04:19.286
Remember? You have staff.

04:19.286 --> 04:21.933
I know I have staff, but I hate my staff.

04:21.933 --> 04:24.315
So I promise you won't
have to do anything.

04:24.315 --> 04:25.865
I just need somebody with a sense

04:25.865 --> 04:27.217
of humor to hang out with me.

04:27.217 --> 04:29.329
Okay, what about Sarah? She
makes you laugh. Hang on.

04:29.329 --> 04:31.689
- Sarah, make Kitty laugh.
- Kitty?

04:31.689 --> 04:34.031
- Sarah?
- Kitty, I'm talking to Kevin.

04:34.031 --> 04:36.039
- Well, so was I.
- Well, I called him first.

04:32.820 --> 04:38.561
- I'm sorry sweetie, I have to go.
- Please, don't go.

04:38.561 --> 04:41.498
- I'm sorry. I love you.
- I love you, too.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.291
No, no, Kevin! Kevin. Kevin.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.987
Kev, Kev, Kevin! Kevin! Kevin?

04:47.987 --> 04:51.112
One demanding, needy,
high-maintenance sister

04:51.112 --> 04:54.576
- at a time, please.
- I heard about this other kind of visa...

04:54.576 --> 04:55.951
No, don't you call me
" high maintenance"...

04:55.951 --> 04:57.208
All right, come on, Nora.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.829
Just please run through
this one more time.

04:58.829 --> 04:59.788
Would you stop doing that? Come on.

04:59.788 --> 05:01.179
Just relax.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.008
Close your eyes and... here you go.

05:03.008 --> 05:07.161
Let's go out tonight for our own sake

05:07.161 --> 05:10.914
and visit a place that I call Narrow Lake

05:13.812 --> 05:16.686
where Saul can't pester me
to sing this stupid song...

05:16.686 --> 05:18.508
Oh, for... that's not
funny. I'm trying help you,

05:18.508 --> 05:21.544
- and you're... you're not taking it seriously.
- I'm sorry, I don't remember it.

05:21.956 --> 05:24.594
Honestly, when it gets to a point

05:24.594 --> 05:26.706
where our only hope of
finding this piece of property

05:26.706 --> 05:28.875
is if I can remember some stupid lyrics,

05:28.875 --> 05:30.336
well, I think we should just give up.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.234
we don't know it'll be worth anything.

05:36.234 --> 05:39.668
And we don't know that this is
actually what Dennis York is after.

05:39.668 --> 05:42.954
What are you talking about?
He filed to do business

05:42.954 --> 05:44.587
as Narrow Lake Development Group.

05:44.587 --> 05:46.181
There's nothing ambiguous about that.

05:46.181 --> 05:47.339
And furthermore,

05:47.339 --> 05:50.018
York was willing to pay
Holly more than Ojai is worth.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.548
There's no other conclusion to make.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.371
Well, then what's her waiting for, huh?

05:53.371 --> 05:56.648
Why doesn't he call me and make an
offer for our half of the company?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.911
I don't know. Maybe he
plans to make an end run

05:58.911 --> 06:00.391
and approach the kids first.

06:00.391 --> 06:03.134
No. No, I don't want
him to talk to the kids.

06:03.135 --> 06:05.672
Well, then I'll contact him.
I'll just set up a meeting

06:05.672 --> 06:06.647
and force his hand.

06:06.647 --> 06:08.848
No, I don't want you to
talk to him either, Saul.

06:08.848 --> 06:09.883
I don't trust him.

05:32.207 --> 06:10.797
And neither is Holly.

06:09.883 --> 06:11.551
Well, sweetheart, until we find out

06:11.551 --> 06:12.767
where and what Narrow Lake is,

06:12.767 --> 06:14.679
that man is holding all the cards.

06:18.850 --> 06:21.417
Okay, mom. What is going on? Seriously.

06:21.417 --> 06:22.875
God. You scared me.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.041
It's beautiful outside,

06:24.041 --> 06:26.123
it's Saturday, dad was
gone for, like, three weeks,

06:26.123 --> 06:29.135
and you're stuck in your
office with the shades drawn.

06:29.135 --> 06:32.274
When I open them, there's a
glare on my computer screen.

06:32.274 --> 06:33.573
Well, you shouldn't be on your computer.

06:35.881 --> 06:38.227
Mom, seriously, what is so important?

06:38.227 --> 06:39.915
I mean, like, what is...
what is all this stuff?

06:39.915 --> 06:42.203
Why are you look at files from 1975?

06:42.203 --> 06:44.280
That's from another project.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.011
They're all going back to storage today.

06:46.011 --> 06:48.550
Mom, what project involves
files from 35 years ago?

06:48.550 --> 06:50.543
You know, sweetie, you
really... you don't want to know.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.316
Trust me. It's just business.

06:52.316 --> 06:53.365
No, it's not just business

06:53.365 --> 06:55.153
when you're here on beautiful Saturdays.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.270
This is your life.

06:58.132 --> 06:59.801
Okay, mom...

06:59.801 --> 07:02.492
We have come way too far for this.

07:02.492 --> 07:04.232
You gotta tell me what's going on.

07:06.995 --> 07:10.212
Has David told you anything?

07:10.212 --> 07:14.710
Just that Ojai is in
more financial trouble.

07:14.710 --> 07:17.452
Yeah, that's true. The company is broke.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.474
And so am I.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.280
What?

07:22.280 --> 07:24.693
I made this terrible investment...

07:24.693 --> 07:27.693
Oh, God. Who am I kidding?

07:29.505 --> 07:32.187
I lost it all in a Ponzi scheme.

07:32.187 --> 07:35.269
Wh... when?

07:35.269 --> 07:36.426
A few months ago.

07:36.426 --> 07:39.028
A few mo... w... why didn't you tell me?

07:39.028 --> 07:40.555
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

07:40.555 --> 07:43.232
But I was afraid you would
worry. Oh, please don't worry.

07:43.232 --> 07:46.915
I have this idea of how
to make Ojai solvent again,

07:46.915 --> 07:48.795
and maybe if I am really lucky,

07:48.795 --> 07:51.707
I will make up some of
the personal money I lost.

07:51.707 --> 07:54.782
Mom, I am your daughter and I love you.

07:54.782 --> 07:56.494
Let me help you.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.668
Okay.

08:01.784 --> 08:02.515
Excuse me.

08:02.515 --> 08:03.825
What could I get for you?

08:09.538 --> 08:10.548
Nora.

08:10.548 --> 08:13.185
- I'm glad to see you.
- Hello, Dennis.

08:13.185 --> 08:15.526
I was so happy to get your call.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.947
Actually, I was just about to call you.

08:17.947 --> 08:19.373
I figured as much.

08:22.108 --> 08:24.047
When I turn the key,
there's a whirring noise,

08:24.047 --> 08:26.035
and it's a brand-new
battery, so it can't be that.

08:26.035 --> 08:27.121
Is it, like, a clicking sound?

08:27.121 --> 08:30.415
No, it's not a clicking
sound. It's more of a groan.

08:30.415 --> 08:31.758
Could you just tell me when you could get

08:31.758 --> 08:33.421
- here, please?
- ABout three hours.

08:33.421 --> 08:36.443
No! God, no. No, no. I
have a million things to do.

08:36.443 --> 08:37.456
I can't wait that long.

08:37.456 --> 08:39.068
I fixed it.

08:39.068 --> 08:41.472
Uh, just a sec. What's that?

08:41.472 --> 08:43.767
Yeah, it was the alternator.
It's all fine now.

08:43.767 --> 08:44.750
Just hang up the phone.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.504
Actually, my boyfriend fixed it.

08:46.504 --> 08:48.768
It was the alternator. Everything's fine.

08:48.768 --> 08:50.735
So thank you and au revoir.

08:50.735 --> 08:51.832
Sarah.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.606
I cannot get by without you.

08:54.606 --> 08:57.846
If you go back to France,
my life's gonna fall apart.

08:57.846 --> 09:00.995
The mailman just delivered it.

09:00.995 --> 09:02.560
It's from the state department.

09:04.148 --> 09:06.645
Kiss me. I'm legal.

09:06.645 --> 09:08.558
You're what?

09:08.558 --> 09:12.770
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:12.770 --> 09:13.409
Really?

09:13.409 --> 09:14.282
Yeah.

09:14.282 --> 09:15.364
Mm. Really?

09:22.104 --> 09:22.805
How's your mother?

09:22.805 --> 09:24.650
Ida's fine, thanks.

09:24.650 --> 09:25.806
Uh-huh. And the kids?

09:25.806 --> 09:27.343
Everybody's fine, Dennis.

09:27.343 --> 09:30.042
Is Tommy still up in Seattle?

09:30.042 --> 09:32.460
That's none of your business.

09:32.460 --> 09:35.067
And I find it kind of disturbing

09:35.067 --> 09:36.011
you know that.

09:37.463 --> 09:39.182
You seem tougher than you used to be...

09:39.182 --> 09:41.289
Colder.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.798
But I guess you've been through
a lot the last few years.

09:43.798 --> 09:44.756
Oh, really? You think?

09:44.756 --> 09:48.103
Maybe cleaning up William's
mess might have changed me?

09:48.103 --> 09:50.098
I don't know.

09:50.098 --> 09:52.622
You seem to have adjusted well.

09:52.622 --> 09:55.303
You've made peace with Holly Harper.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.262
Let's just cut the small talk, all right?

09:58.747 --> 09:59.988
Dennis, I don't know

09:59.988 --> 10:01.885
why you want to buy the company so badly,

10:01.885 --> 10:03.067
but it's not gonna happen.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.193
Even if I wanted to sell it,

10:05.193 --> 10:05.514
I couldn't

10:06.683 --> 10:08.773
it belongs to you and your family.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.228
And they all have shares.

10:10.228 --> 10:12.248
Do you expect me to
convince them all to sell?

10:12.248 --> 10:14.008
Yes, I do.

10:14.008 --> 10:16.417
And you will.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.848
Or I'll tell them all what happened.

10:24.251 --> 10:26.176
I don't get it. My mom lives alone,

10:26.176 --> 10:27.539
and she always has a ton of leftovers.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.301
I know. It's mystifying. Here.

10:29.301 --> 10:31.825
Thanks.

10:31.825 --> 10:33.778
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:33.778 --> 10:36.451
Nora, I'm so sorry to barge in like this.

10:36.451 --> 10:37.111
I told Justin, it's... it's a little...

10:37.111 --> 10:38.125
Although I explained it to her,

10:38.125 --> 10:39.373
if you didn't want me to use my key,

10:39.373 --> 10:40.665
you woulda changed the
locks a long time ago.

10:46.578 --> 10:47.830
Um... wait. Um, before you go upstairs,

10:47.830 --> 10:50.255
um, Rebecca wants to talk
to you about something.

10:53.164 --> 10:55.199
Nothing. What is it, Rebecca?

10:55.199 --> 10:57.759
- O... okay.
- Well, Nora, you know how I felt

10:57.759 --> 11:01.154
when my mom gave me that
money from William's estate.

11:01.154 --> 11:04.262
You know, I was... I was angry
and ashamed and I... I kinda knew

11:04.262 --> 11:05.702
that everybody thought
I didn't deserve it.

11:05.702 --> 11:07.312
No one thought that.

11:07.312 --> 11:09.304
Nora, it was $2 million.

11:09.304 --> 11:11.244
Full disclosure... I thought
it was a little excessive.

11:11.244 --> 11:13.785
Exactly, which is why I
gave it to you to hold on to.

11:13.785 --> 11:15.121
But I think I know what I want

11:17.203 --> 11:19.503
well, my mom and I have
come a long way since then,

11:19.503 --> 11:22.993
and... I think I want to
give it to her and Ojai.

11:25.573 --> 11:27.664
How... how much of it do
you want to give to her?

11:27.664 --> 11:29.430
All of it.

11:29.430 --> 11:30.742
What?

11:30.742 --> 11:34.606
Ma, look, you know I... I stay
out of the whole Ojai thing,

11:34.606 --> 11:37.239
but we know the... the
company's in bad shape.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.304
Yeah, and we just found
out about Narrow Lake.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.907
Yeah, which kind of blows my mind.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.387
I mean, how come you
didn't tell us about that?

11:43.821 --> 11:46.091
Well, we don't know where Narrow Lake...

11:46.091 --> 11:47.767
it... it may not even exist.

11:47.767 --> 11:48.397
Well, exactly.

11:48.397 --> 11:49.919
And see, this is why I want
to give her the money...

11:49.919 --> 11:51.937
so it'll give her the
time to figure it out.

10:43.435 --> 11:53.381
Help yourself.

11:51.937 --> 11:54.038
You know, I mean, she has
a strong hunch about this.

11:54.038 --> 11:57.062
And I... and I really want to support her.

11:57.062 --> 12:00.164
Has... has your mother
ag... agreed to this?

12:00.164 --> 12:01.708
I haven't told her yet.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.344
I kind of wanted to take
care of this part first.

12:04.707 --> 12:07.761
Rebecca, what you want
to do is... is admirable.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.911
Honey, it's really admirable.

12:08.911 --> 12:10.983
But I have to tell you,

12:10.983 --> 12:13.640
the company is in a very
precarious situation,

12:13.640 --> 12:16.110
and anything could happen... anything.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.012
I... I really don't want you
to gamble away your future.

12:19.012 --> 12:21.953
Mom, this is Rebecca's money. All right?

12:21.953 --> 12:22.794
She wants to help out Holly.

12:22.794 --> 12:24.382
I'd do the same thing
for you in a heartbeat.

12:24.382 --> 12:25.638
I thought you'd be all over this.

12:25.638 --> 12:28.658
Well, I... I... I just
wasn't expecting this.

12:28.658 --> 12:30.163
It's out of the blue is all.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.124
Mom, what what's the matter with you?

12:31.124 --> 12:33.620
Nothing is the matter. Nothing.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.043
I'm... I'm crabby. I'm... I'm fine. Sorry.

12:37.410 --> 12:40.325
Sorry. I, um... of course.

12:40.325 --> 12:41.715
I will... I will, um...

12:41.715 --> 12:43.374
I'll take care of it. Whatever you want.

12:50.404 --> 12:53.123
So we've got about 50 members
of the Burbank Boosters Club.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.121
Okay. They're very receptive to

12:56.283 --> 12:57.716
oh, if you're gonna
talk about job creation,

12:57.716 --> 12:59.643
I might actually listen.

12:59.643 --> 13:01.110
I'm just so proud to be working with you.

13:01.110 --> 13:02.679
Mrs. Walker-McCallister.

13:02.679 --> 13:03.168
Well, thanks.

10:50.255 --> 13:05.170
Please let it be good news.

13:04.745 --> 13:06.295
And... and you, too, Mr. Walker.

13:06.295 --> 13:08.381
Oh, I'm not... I'm not working today.

13:08.381 --> 13:09.861
I'm just carrying Kitty's water.

13:09.861 --> 13:10.732
Oh, okay.

13:10.732 --> 13:13.960
- Uh, that's a figure of speech, Brad.
- Oh, okay.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.008
- But I actually am a little thirsty.
- I only brought one.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.653
That's okay. You know
what? He's my brother.

13:18.653 --> 13:20.657
- So it's... it's okay.
- Yeah, great.

13:20.657 --> 13:23.045
So why don't you go
ahead and introduce Kitty?

13:23.045 --> 13:24.916
Sure. Got it.

13:24.916 --> 13:27.661
I don't know why you
think your staff's not fun.

13:29.906 --> 13:32.240
Welcome to the Burbank Boosters Club.

13:35.766 --> 13:37.328
Now I'm very pleased to introduce

13:37.328 --> 13:38.218
our speaker for today...

13:38.218 --> 13:41.862
the next United States Senator
from the state of California,

13:41.862 --> 13:43.679
Kitty McCallister.

13:43.679 --> 13:45.094
Yes!

13:49.516 --> 13:51.614
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

13:53.710 --> 13:55.801
- What do I do?
- Say something.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.228
- No, what do I...
- Just take control. Calm them.

13:58.210 --> 14:02.509
- Uh, good morning.
- America for Americans!

14:02.509 --> 14:04.301
America for Americans!

14:04.301 --> 14:06.725
America for Americans!

14:06.725 --> 14:09.018
America for Americans!

14:09.018 --> 14:13.889
America for Americans!

14:13.889 --> 14:15.739
America for Americans!

14:19.727 --> 14:21.718
Sarah, you need to call me

14:21.605 --> 14:22.999
the minute you get this message.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.203
Somehow Robert and I got all tangled up

14:25.203 --> 14:26.507
in Luc's immigration problems,

14:26.507 --> 14:28.164
and it's turned intoa huge mess.

14:28.164 --> 14:30.486
So put on your clothes
and call me, please. Meow.

14:31.592 --> 14:33.952
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess
I get a little touchy

14:33.952 --> 14:35.308
when I'm accused of corruption.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.253
Have we figured out where
this is coming from yet?

14:37.253 --> 14:39.762
Half the right-wing
web sites have posted it

14:39.762 --> 14:41.532
without sourcing it. Wow. Look at this.

14:41.532 --> 14:44.223
"Mac & Cat pull strings
for sister's boy-toy!!"

14:44.223 --> 14:45.195
They called me Cat?

14:45.195 --> 14:45.710
Yeah.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.305
Oh, now I really hate them.

14:47.305 --> 14:49.634
Now you're sure that Sarah never asked you

14:49.634 --> 14:50.599
to reach out on Luc's behalf?

14:50.599 --> 14:51.955
No, and I never offered.

14:51.955 --> 14:52.571
What about you?

14:52.571 --> 14:54.039
What? No, no. The only thing

14:54.040 --> 14:56.399
I did was, I called Mario to
see if he could look into it.

14:56.399 --> 14:58.613
He's an immigration
attorney at my old firm.

14:58.613 --> 14:59.103
Okay, you know what? Get him on the phone.

14:59.103 --> 15:00.053
I want to talk to him.

15:00.053 --> 15:01.955
I already left a message.
He hasn't called me back.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.488
Look at this. This one
posted Luc's passport photo.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.207
Why the hell do you think
they put him in a beard?

15:08.207 --> 15:08.950
Well, b... because...

15:08.950 --> 15:11.466
because he's fidel
Castro's illegitimate son.

15:11.466 --> 15:12.099
What?

15:12.099 --> 15:14.058
Unbelievable. They really have no shame.

15:14.058 --> 15:15.952
This is anonymous character assassination,

15:15.953 --> 15:17.663
plus guilt by association.

15:17.664 --> 15:20.328
It's just the conservative purity police

15:20.329 --> 15:21.561
trying to purge the party of lily...

15:21.561 --> 15:23.395
livered republican moderates.

15:23.395 --> 15:24.841
Yeah, well, they're gonna have to decide,

15:24.841 --> 15:26.984
because I can't be
lily-livered and Hitler

15:26.984 --> 15:27.976
all at the same time.

15:27.976 --> 15:30.163
No, I'm lily-livered. You are Hitler.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.034
Every web site is linked
to every other website.

15:33.034 --> 15:35.263
But blog, it just spreads exponentially.

15:36.512 --> 15:38.401
Oh, my God.

15:38.401 --> 15:40.093
Trudy's truths.

15:40.093 --> 15:42.980
Trudy. Trudy
what? T-r-u-d-y?

15:42.980 --> 15:44.881
Yeah, she was an assistant
at my old law firm.

15:44.881 --> 15:46.667
She used to pray every
night that I wouldn't be gay.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.514
Spends her weekends in the desert

15:48.514 --> 15:51.468
securing the Mexican
border from alien invaders.

15:51.468 --> 15:53.412
She must have started it on her blog.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.879
She must have found out that
I called Mario for advice

15:55.879 --> 15:57.689
and made the rest up.

15:57.689 --> 16:02.355
I think these elites who don't
believe in our constitution

16:02.355 --> 16:03.919
and don't love this country

16:03.919 --> 16:07.004
should follow the laws our
soldiers fought and died for

16:07.004 --> 16:09.275
and stop taking jobs away from Americans.

16:09.275 --> 16:11.430
Wow. She's good.

16:11.430 --> 16:14.654
She had "elites," the constitution,
love of country, dead soldiers,

16:14.654 --> 16:16.395
immigration and jobs all in one sentence.

16:16.395 --> 16:18.215
I am so getting her fired.

16:18.215 --> 16:19.929
Don't, don't, 'cause then we're, you know,

16:19.929 --> 16:22.500
accused of silencing
Trudy the truth teller.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.965
We need to prepare a statement,

16:23.965 --> 16:26.187
because this is gonna
spread to mainstream media.

16:26.187 --> 16:28.520
You say "we." You're looking at me.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.811
Well, yeah. I'm late
for the motorcycle club.

16:30.811 --> 16:34.175
And I have a flight to
Sacramento in 20 minutes.

16:34.175 --> 16:37.266
W... wait. W... I... I
don't even work here anymore.

16:37.266 --> 16:39.315
You know, this is Sarah's prob...

16:39.315 --> 16:40.747
- I shouldn't even be here, Kit.
- Kevin, I need your help.

16:40.747 --> 16:44.326
When Sarah needed a favor,
you sure hopped to it.

16:44.326 --> 16:45.764
Yeah, look how that turned out.

16:45.766 --> 16:49.285
Just write the statement please,
oki? And I'll call you later.

16:51.065 --> 16:52.576
Yes, mein fuhrer.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.448
Not funny.

16:56.399 --> 16:56.961
Holly.

16:56.961 --> 16:58.571
Oh, hey, Nora.

16:58.571 --> 16:59.943
Rebecca told me you
were working here today.

16:59.943 --> 17:00.885
I tried to call you. Why didn't you

17:00.886 --> 17:01.881
- answer your phone?
- Yeah, she told me...

17:01.881 --> 17:04.727
thank you so much for
facilitating all of this.

17:04.727 --> 17:05.558
Why did you tell her?

17:05.558 --> 17:09.405
I lost my money months ago.
It's time that she knew...

17:09.405 --> 17:10.712
No, I mean about the damn lake.

17:10.712 --> 17:15.223
Oh, no, I didn't say one
word about Dennis York.

17:15.223 --> 17:18.104
I told you I wanted to keep
the kids out of it, all of it.

17:18.104 --> 17:21.284
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't
think it would be any harm

17:21.284 --> 17:24.468
to tell her about Narrow
Lake. I mean, that's good news.

15:15.952 --> 17:25.549
Plus guilt by association.

17:24.468 --> 17:26.433
What possible harm could come from that?

17:26.433 --> 17:29.597
Oh, Holly. You met Dennis.

17:29.597 --> 17:31.299
Do I really have to answer that question?

17:31.299 --> 17:35.440
I didn't realize that
you had an objection.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.006
I apologize.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.661
Well, obviously, you're...

17:48.661 --> 17:51.003
you're not going to accept
Rebecca's money, are you?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.977
Well, yes, I am.

17:52.977 --> 17:55.125
But I'm not gonna spend a penny of it

17:55.125 --> 17:56.939
until I'm sure she'll get it all back.

17:56.939 --> 17:59.092
I can't believe you'd take
your own child's money.

17:59.092 --> 18:05.009
Nora, Rebecca and I have
never had an easy relationship.

18:05.009 --> 18:07.003
And how the hell does this
help your relationship?

18:07.003 --> 18:09.018
I gave her the money.

18:08.993 --> 18:11.558
The only reason that you have it is,

18:11.558 --> 18:13.481
she was so mad at me at the time,

18:13.481 --> 18:14.879
that she refused to accept it.

18:14.879 --> 18:18.601
This is not about $2 million.

18:18.601 --> 18:22.372
This is about her accepting me again.

18:22.372 --> 18:25.414
The only thing I don't understand

18:25.414 --> 18:27.509
is why you're so upset about it.

18:27.509 --> 18:29.059
I... is that because you're trying

18:29.060 --> 18:31.908
- to protect Justin's interest, then you should know...
- Oh, this isn't about Justin.

18:31.908 --> 18:33.169
- This has nothing to do with Justin.
- Then what is it?

18:33.169 --> 18:35.892
It's nothing. All right? It's nothing.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.975
I'm sorry. It's...

18:40.975 --> 18:43.530
whenever money's involved,

18:43.530 --> 18:45.970
things just... get more complicated.

18:45.970 --> 18:46.596
That's all.

18:49.105 --> 18:50.303
I'll talk to you later.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.692
Maybe we could take a
little trip to New York

18:54.692 --> 18:55.763
- in July.
- Oh, I'll take you to new York.

18:55.763 --> 18:58.711
I know all the best
restaurants and art galleries.

18:58.711 --> 18:59.301
You will love it.

18:59.302 --> 19:02.129
- You know, that it sounds so good.
- Why are there so many people...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.877
Oh, God.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.899
I hope some celebutant
hasn't moved onto my block

19:07.899 --> 19:09.090
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

19:09.090 --> 19:10.159
What's going on here?

19:10.159 --> 19:11.733
You're Sarah Walker, right?

19:11.733 --> 19:12.861
And you're Luc Laurent?

19:12.861 --> 19:13.765
What's going on, man?

19:13.765 --> 19:16.044
Luc, did you know Sarah was related
to a senator when you started dating?

19:16.044 --> 19:17.352
Wait. Uh, this is about Kitty?

19:17.352 --> 19:18.918
Did you ask your sister to help you?

19:18.919 --> 19:19.949
Help me with what?

19:18.918 --> 19:21.545
Hey, Sarah, how long have you known Luc?

19:21.546 --> 19:22.433
Forget it. Let's go.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.842
Did Kitty McCallister tell you she
could pull strings to get you a visa?

19:24.842 --> 19:25.551
Sarah is Kitty's sister.

19:25.551 --> 19:26.241
Luc, don't answer that.

19:26.241 --> 19:27.128
Why don't you want him to answer that?

19:27.128 --> 19:29.020
Okay, I don't know where you
people got your information,

19:29.020 --> 19:31.722
but my sister did not use
any influence to help Luc.

19:31.722 --> 19:32.952
Turn the camera off.

19:32.952 --> 19:33.823
- Sarah, how much older are you than him?
- Excuse me?

19:33.823 --> 19:34.850
Excuse me.

19:34.850 --> 19:35.322
Do you always date younger men?

19:35.323 --> 19:37.838
Okay, you guys are really
starting to piss me off.

19:37.839 --> 19:39.462
- Forget it.
- Is it true he wouldn't marry you,

19:39.463 --> 19:40.830
so you had to go to your
sister to keep him around?

19:40.971 --> 19:44.795
Oh, that's nice!

19:44.795 --> 19:46.419
Is this what you douche
bags do for a living

19:46.419 --> 19:49.457
or is harassing private
citizens your idea of fun?

19:49.457 --> 19:52.295
It is people like you that
give this country a bad name.

19:52.295 --> 19:53.598
Thank you, Sarah. Have a great day.

19:53.598 --> 19:54.941
- Be sure to stretch.
- Go, cougar.

20:10.420 --> 20:10.970
Tommy.

20:11.020 --> 20:11.630
Mom.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.060
- Hi.
- Hey. Uh, you all right?

20:15.110 --> 20:17.160
- Yeah.
- What's with the, uh, sudden trip?

20:17.480 --> 20:20.110
- Oh. I'm glad to see you. I'll tell you all about it.
- Okay.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.180
Thanks.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.660
So how are you?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.250
How am I? Let's see.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.000
Well, I'm pretty much
treading water right now.

20:39.390 --> 20:43.800
I, uh, got a job at a grocery
wholesaler a few weeks ago.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.780
Well, Tommy, that's wonderful.

20:46.070 --> 20:46.970
Really?

20:47.240 --> 20:50.090
Back to the, uh,
rose-colored glasses already?

20:50.210 --> 20:53.090
What about Julia and
Elizabeth? How's that?

20:53.140 --> 20:55.670
Yeah, that's pretty much
gone from bad to worse.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.990
Julia will barely speak to me,

20:58.260 --> 21:01.230
and I'm getting less and
less time with Elizabeth.

21:02.330 --> 21:05.760
Yeah, I thought getting
a job would help...

21:06.220 --> 21:09.370
You know, show Julia that I've changed.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.080
But... no, it's not.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.750
Tommy, maybe it's time
for you to come home.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.720
Is that what this is about,
getting me to come home?

21:26.220 --> 21:30.150
What, mom? What...
what... what's going on?

21:30.180 --> 21:32.430
I... I know you talk
to Sarah all the time.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.260
Did she tell you someone
tried to buy Ojai foods?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.670
Yeah, Obstfeld something or other?

21:36.671 --> 21:37.400
Obstfeld group.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.040
Yeah, Obstfeld something or other?

21:38.060 --> 21:39.940
Yeah, but that didn't happen.

21:40.010 --> 21:43.380
No, but the Obstfeld group was a front.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.620
It's Dennis York.

21:47.790 --> 21:50.270
- W... why?
- I don't know.

21:50.420 --> 21:51.690
Why would he want to buy Ojai?

21:51.740 --> 21:53.280
It's never been in worse shape.

21:53.420 --> 21:58.550
Tommy, have you ever heard
of a place called Narrow Lake?

22:01.250 --> 22:02.780
No.

22:03.730 --> 22:05.870
Well, I've managed to talk
Sarah down off the ledge,

22:05.920 --> 22:07.580
because in addition to everything else,

22:07.630 --> 22:10.890
she wasn't aware he was a porn star.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.140
He was a porn star?

22:13.190 --> 22:14.430
No, of course he wasn't a porn star.

22:14.450 --> 22:17.330
- That's what they're saying.
- Oh, my God. Thank God.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.180
Thank God he's not a porn star.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.470
You know, I'm just... I'm
still actually very surprised

22:21.470 --> 22:25.060
that... that Miss Sarah La-di-da
has not called me to apologize.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.520
Well, keep in mind,
you know, it hasn't been

22:26.540 --> 22:28.440
a walk on the beach for her today either.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.740
Okay, here she comes. Just
please... just be nice.

22:30.780 --> 22:34.200
- Kitty's on the phone.
- Oh, about time. Hey.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.560
- Hey. How are you holding up?
- Uh, okay.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.710
The kids called from Joe's.
Cooper thinks it's awesome.

22:39.730 --> 22:42.120
But Paige wants to
expire from embarrassment.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.160
- Well, business as usual.
- No, Kitty. I wouldn't say that.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.340
Yeah, well, you should just be happy

22:46.380 --> 22:49.410
- they're not drawing moustaches on your face.
- I would prefer that

22:49.460 --> 22:52.140
than being called " the
famous Pasadena cougar."

22:52.380 --> 22:54.430
And for the record, I'm not
that much older than Luc.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.990
Maybe you should've
thought of that, Sarah,

22:55.990 --> 22:58.230
when you decided to call
the cameraman a douche bag.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.520
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

22:59.550 --> 23:02.740
You know what? Had I known that I was
about to be swarmed by paparazzi, Kitty,

23:02.760 --> 23:04.030
I might have been able to prepare

23:04.080 --> 23:05.880
- a more appropriate response.
- Right, right.

23:05.930 --> 23:08.370
Because I have complete control
over what the paparazzi does.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.930
And besides, you know what
I did? I did try to call you.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.300
But you didn't answer your phone.

23:12.810 --> 23:15.100
Well, that is not my fault, is it?

23:15.120 --> 23:16.830
No, Kitty, apparently
nothing is your fault

23:16.850 --> 23:17.410
okay, you know what?

23:17.440 --> 23:18.970
There are so many people to hate in this.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.530
Let's not waste time and energy
hating each other, please.

23:21.830 --> 23:25.850
Okay, okay. You know what?
Look, I... I totally agree.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.380
Here's the thing, Sarah...
the entire blogosphere

23:29.380 --> 23:31.330
is screaming for Luc's visa to be revoked

23:31.330 --> 23:33.480
until there's an investigation,
and sooner or later,

23:33.530 --> 23:35.770
the state department is gonna
have to give in to the pressure.

23:35.870 --> 23:38.160
Well, then fight them. Don't
let them get away with it.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.640
The best way to fight them
is to hand it in voluntarily

23:40.690 --> 23:41.570
and prove to them that we

23:41.570 --> 23:43.710
- have nothing to hide.
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.910
- No, no, no, s...
- Look, just don't waste your breath, Kevin.

23:45.930 --> 23:46.930
We're not gonna do it.

23:46.980 --> 23:49.130
Just tell her that I
will drive down there,

23:49.170 --> 23:52.050
we will sit down... Luc, Sarah
and I... and we will discuss it.

23:52.050 --> 23:52.860
Okay, she's gonna come

23:54.150 --> 23:56.100
no, she can't come over here.

23:56.150 --> 23:57.750
Luc is much nicer than I am, and I

23:57.800 --> 24:00.750
- don't want him to cave.
- You have to go somewhere else.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.750
Okay, fine. Mom's house, two hours.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.120
But I'm calling the nanny,
so Sarah better be there.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.820
- Mom's, two hours?
- Okay.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.700
Yeah, okay. But I'm not coming with.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.990
- Oh, damn straight you are.
- Yes, you are.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.740
- Wh... haven't I suffered enough?
- No.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.450
No.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.030
So, uh, where'd you see him?

24:19.110 --> 24:21.180
At his hotel.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.320
He wants Ojai, Tommy.

24:23.350 --> 24:25.350
He demanded that we sell it to him.

24:25.740 --> 24:28.660
York is not the type to make idle threats.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.390
I mean, I... I'd hate
to think what kind of...

24:30.420 --> 24:32.120
what kind of dirt he has on dad.

24:32.290 --> 24:34.070
I just can't stand any
more of William's scandals.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.140
I want it to go away. I
want William to stay buried.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.560
Mom... why'd you come here?

24:42.530 --> 24:45.940
I can convince all the
kids to sell except Sarah.

24:46.990 --> 24:48.550
You know what Ojai means to her.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.530
The two of you grew up in that company

24:50.550 --> 24:51.820
working for your father.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.260
I'm afraid to even talk
to her about it, Tommy.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.940
I need you to convince Sarah to sell.

24:55.940 --> 24:58.470
Mom, I'm up here getting my life together.

24:58.670 --> 25:00.690
And you're... you're
dragging me back into this?

25:00.720 --> 25:01.840
I don't ask you this lightly.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.740
I swear, I don't ask you this lightly.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.420
I have no one else to turn to.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.400
Holly just wants the money
she thinks that's there.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.930
It's not her family that's at risk, Tommy.

25:11.030 --> 25:13.300
It's ours.

25:14.150 --> 25:17.100
Look, you want me to sell my Ojai shares?

25:17.170 --> 25:18.800
Fine. I'll do it.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.480
But I am not going down there.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.310
Ojai foods is ground zero

25:23.360 --> 25:26.000
for everything that went wrong in my life.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.360
I'm sorry. I can't.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.180
Hey, where's mom?

25:38.330 --> 25:39.030
Good question.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.500
Why is it so cold in here?

25:40.710 --> 25:42.840
Because the thermostat
was turned down to 50.

25:42.910 --> 25:44.030
Nobody knows where mom is.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.860
She's not answering her cell phone.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.050
I'm a little worried.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.830
Well, I'm sure she hasn't been kidnapped

25:48.860 --> 25:50.170
unless the guy's really eco-conscious.

25:50.170 --> 25:51.780
Okay, I'm telling you, I was here earlier,

25:51.810 --> 25:52.980
and she's like, "nothing's wrong,"

25:53.000 --> 25:54.170
but something is definitely wrong.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.360
So I'm gonna stay here
until she gets back.

25:56.510 --> 25:57.830
You might want to reconsider that.

25:57.830 --> 25:59.480
There is gonna be some unpleasantness

25:59.480 --> 26:01.260
coming through that door any minute now.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.020
What do you mean, unpleasantness?

26:05.020 --> 26:06.310
Where's mom?

26:06.360 --> 26:07.330
- She's not here.
- She's not here.

26:07.380 --> 26:10.700
- It's cold in here.
- Sarah, look, I... I just want to say, I'm...

26:10.720 --> 26:13.330
I'm really sorry for what
you and Luc are going through.

26:14.620 --> 26:17.620
- Thanks, Justin.
- But can I ask you a question?

26:17.640 --> 26:18.200
What's that?

26:18.230 --> 26:20.960
Is Luc trying to get citizenship
so he can buy the Lakers?

26:21.930 --> 26:22.590
No.

26:22.590 --> 26:25.080
Okay. Yeah. Is he ambidextrous?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.420
- No, Justin.
- Okay. Well, then this last thing...

26:27.470 --> 26:29.430
he probably never worked
in a French brothel.

26:29.460 --> 26:32.100
This is character assassination.

26:32.130 --> 26:33.530
Hello. Hey.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.360
- Where's mom?
- She's not here.

26:36.830 --> 26:37.920
It's freezing in here.

26:37.950 --> 26:39.580
Yeah.

26:39.650 --> 26:42.290
Look at this. There's a
free Luc Laurent web page.

26:42.430 --> 26:43.650
You can buy, like, free Luc t-shirts,

26:43.650 --> 26:44.960
- free Luc coffee mugs.
- Justin, are you...

26:45.000 --> 26:47.160
Yeah, and for the record,
he's not going to jail, okay?

26:47.210 --> 26:49.900
No, it means "free him from the claws

26:49.930 --> 26:51.960
of the oversexed housewife."

26:52.110 --> 26:53.160
I guess that's me.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.910
Okay, Kitty, would you
please apologize to Sarah?

26:57.060 --> 26:58.570
Why? That's not my web site.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.010
I know. Just do it.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.570
Okay. Okay, fine.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.390
Sarah, I am very sorry
that because of my campaign,

27:05.440 --> 27:08.370
you got sucked up into
this political firestorm,

27:08.420 --> 27:10.680
and you have had to pay a personal price

27:10.710 --> 27:13.440
through almost no fault of your own.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.000
That's your apology?

27:16.020 --> 27:18.900
Wow. You're unbelievable.

27:18.990 --> 27:20.940
Unbelievable? Where
the hell is my apology?

27:21.040 --> 27:23.410
I am fighting for my
political life with a bunch of

27:23.430 --> 27:25.920
ultraconservative yahoos who want my head

27:26.000 --> 27:27.430
because you decided to
fall in love with a guy

27:27.430 --> 27:29.520
who has immigration
issues, and apparently,

27:32.080 --> 27:37.230
okay, Sarah, please just apologize
to Kitty so we can move on.

27:38.860 --> 27:39.910
No.

27:40.370 --> 27:42.470
I don't even know why I'm here.

27:42.690 --> 27:44.960
I'm sorry that Kitty
has political problems,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.340
- but they're not mine to solve.
- Of course not.

27:47.810 --> 27:50.730
She did just say she was sorry.

27:50.970 --> 27:51.510
Did not.

27:51.730 --> 27:52.760
Technically, I heard "sorry."

27:53.900 --> 27:55.460
I didn't mean it either.

27:55.850 --> 27:58.560
You know who deserves an apology here? Me.

27:58.700 --> 28:00.700
There are two things... no,
I have said I want no part...

28:00.730 --> 28:02.430
- Oh, Kevin, seriously, this is not about you.
- Oh, my God.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.060
- Honest to God.
- I have made it clear I want no part of two things...

28:05.110 --> 28:08.030
law and politics... both of
which I've been doing all day...

28:08.060 --> 28:09.690
For the two of you. Have I

28:09.690 --> 28:11.030
- heard a word of thanks?
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.800
Luc, Luc, speaking of apologies,

28:12.830 --> 28:14.470
he's the one taking the most hits here.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.150
Yes, a poor innocent
caught up in this insanity.

28:16.180 --> 28:19.200
- I'm so sorry.
- I need to talk to you.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.300
- Hey, Luc, don't listen to all this stupid...
- Yeah.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.710
Internet chatter and stuff.

28:22.760 --> 28:23.690
It's stupid. Is everything okay?

28:23.730 --> 28:26.510
Yeah, um, I'm sorry.
But about this one thing,

28:26.660 --> 28:27.050
it's, uh, it's true.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.050
Oh, please, God. Let him be ambidextrous.

28:29.150 --> 28:32.360
I'm sorry, Kitty. It's true
about the Maison de Joie...

28:33.050 --> 28:35.630
Uh, whorehouse.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.020
Well, a... after my father lost his job,

28:47.050 --> 28:50.350
my parents started to have problems.

28:50.790 --> 28:56.220
So one day they say to me that it's a
good idea for a boy to experience the city.

28:56.250 --> 28:58.950
So they sent you to a whorehouse?

28:58.980 --> 29:02.170
Well, no. They sent me to
my uncle Tony in Marseille.

29:02.250 --> 29:05.380
They thought Tony was an hotelier

29:05.420 --> 29:07.020
and he owned his own hotel.

29:07.070 --> 29:08.290
Ah.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.630
Well, I guess they weren't that far off.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.410
I never lived in the...

29:13.980 --> 29:14.780
Whorehouse.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.940
No. I... I, um, I just
ran errands for people.

29:18.630 --> 29:23.980
I'd bring cigarettes and wine,
swept the floor and washed dishes.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.160
I'm sorry, Sarah.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.110
I didn't know that it
would ever matter to anyone.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.940
No, come on. I'm sorry.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.280
Luc, none of this is your fault.

29:34.470 --> 29:37.300
And as much as I would
like to blame Kitty...

29:38.440 --> 29:40.720
It's not her fault either.

29:41.660 --> 29:43.620
Now she's furious at me.

29:43.650 --> 29:46.920
Kevin's furious at me.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.480
This whole thing is such a disaster.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.380
I don't know what to do.

29:51.420 --> 29:55.580
See, none of this would've ever
happened if it weren't for me.

29:55.620 --> 29:59.770
I cannot let this go on any longer.

30:00.580 --> 30:02.380
I have to make it right.

30:05.770 --> 30:06.990
No, is this what you do for a living...

30:07.770 --> 30:09.250
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:09.690 --> 30:12.380
- Your idea of fun?
- You should turn that off,

30:12.420 --> 30:13.960
'cause it's gonna make you crazy.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.960
Yeah, well, did you hear
the latest bombshell?

30:17.350 --> 30:18.710
About the brothel?

30:18.830 --> 30:21.810
- Oh, my God. You already know about it?
- Is it true?

30:21.860 --> 30:23.070
Apparently.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.070
I mean, it's not as bad as it sounds,

30:25.070 --> 30:26.150
but... but I'm telling you,

30:26.170 --> 30:28.900
- Sarah is completely freaking out.
- You better call her.

30:29.020 --> 30:32.390
I know. I know I should,
but I don't know what to say.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.430
I mean, you know we
can't control this crap

30:34.480 --> 30:35.550
that they put on the Internet.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.460
And if we do some big sort of denial,

30:37.460 --> 30:39.990
it'll just cross over
into the mainstream media.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.480
Well, it's already crossed
over to the mainstream media.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.940
The networks are calling for an interview.

30:45.300 --> 30:48.860
And I've just been told that
Luc's visa has been revoked.

30:49.060 --> 30:51.150
Great. Great. Of course. Of course.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.320
And he's only got three weeks left,

30:52.370 --> 30:54.270
so he's right back where
he started, and I...

30:54.300 --> 30:56.520
you know, what... what... oy.

30:56.570 --> 30:58.710
- What do you think we should do?
- We could schedule

30:58.710 --> 31:01.100
on-camera interviews
tomorrow for both of us.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.390
Tell the truth, defend the family,

31:03.550 --> 31:05.450
demand Luc's visa be reinstated

31:05.480 --> 31:07.520
and talk about what you believe in

31:07.550 --> 31:08.970
and hope that another scandal comes along

31:08.970 --> 31:10.580
and makes people forget about it.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.280
I love you.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.450
You think they'll believe us?

31:17.480 --> 31:18.720
I don't know.

31:19.090 --> 31:20.260
I mean, they've done a
good job of spinning it

31:20.260 --> 31:22.940
even though we have the truth on our side.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.940
It's Kevin. Hi, Kevin.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.820
No, you're kidding me.
Well, no, no. I'm on my way.

31:30.850 --> 31:32.030
I'll... I'll... I...
I will meet you there.

31:32.060 --> 31:33.660
I will meet you there. Wh...

31:33.790 --> 31:35.910
- I gotta go.
- Well, where you going?

31:35.910 --> 31:38.610
LAX. I gotta go. Okay.

31:41.730 --> 31:44.420
Okay, hit it really hard. One, two, three.

31:44.450 --> 31:47.480
- Whoa! Whoo!
- There it goes, right through the middle.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.750
- Whoa! Almost.
- Oh, my goodness. Let's see where it went.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.510
- Hey, mom, coffee.
- Where is it?

31:51.650 --> 31:53.310
Here!

31:53.410 --> 31:55.410
Is it there? There it is!

31:55.500 --> 31:58.450
Oh, my goodness. You have
to hit it in that hole now.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.980
Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.920
Move it where you want it.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.300
Oh, God, Tommy, she's so adorable.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.130
And she's so smart... so smart.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.080
I know. I feel so lucky.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.780
You know what the hardest part is?

32:13.850 --> 32:16.780
It's feeling like she...
like she deserves more.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.420
Oh, Tommy, stop it.
To her, you're perfect.

32:19.450 --> 32:22.350
You are her one and only perfect daddy.

32:22.380 --> 32:26.270
And then she'll hit adolescence
and discover all your flaws.

32:26.360 --> 32:26.950
Yeah.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.090
In dad's case, the flaws just
keep on coming, don't they?

32:31.170 --> 32:32.780
Yeah.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.820
He was a whole lot less
than we all deserved.

32:36.850 --> 32:41.870
You know, the hardest
thing about letting go is...

32:42.450 --> 32:44.680
Letting go of him...

32:45.010 --> 32:48.080
the hope that...

32:48.120 --> 32:52.320
he was the father that I wanted him to be.

32:52.350 --> 32:54.300
You know, we've all been telling ourselves

32:54.320 --> 32:56.380
this story, this big fairy tale,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.730
that the wonderful
business that William built

32:58.780 --> 33:01.320
somehow made up for
all the pain he caused,

33:01.320 --> 33:03.660
that... that the very best part of William

33:03.710 --> 33:04.880
was his damn company.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.070
It's not true.

33:06.190 --> 33:09.090
The very best part of William's you...

33:09.120 --> 33:10.170
all of his children.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.550
And I don't want you to suffer anymore.

33:11.550 --> 33:14.920
I don't want the sins of the
father to haunt you anymore, Tommy.

33:19.920 --> 33:23.950
If I... come down...

33:24.180 --> 33:26.130
help convince the others
to sell the company,

33:26.330 --> 33:28.620
is that...

33:28.760 --> 33:30.620
is that the end of it?

33:30.660 --> 33:35.220
Yes, short of burning it to the ground.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.680
Okay.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.620
I guess it's time for me to come home.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.580
Thank you.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.540
There's everything but the fog.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.060
Why would there be fog?

34:00.110 --> 34:02.600
In the movie, "Casablanca,"

34:02.640 --> 34:06.200
there's fog when they said good-bye.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.870
Looks like we're in our own movie.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.900
Oh, my God. He's actually filming us.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.670
Look, just ignore him.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.639
Wonder how they'll twist this around.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.670
They'll probably say you're dumping me.

34:18.929 --> 34:21.870
Just don't look at him. Just look at me.

34:26.610 --> 34:28.480
It's time, Sarah. I gotta go.

34:28.530 --> 34:30.239
I know.

34:30.530 --> 34:32.070
I know.

34:32.409 --> 34:34.100
I gotta go through security.

34:36.429 --> 34:37.650
You gonna be okay here?

34:37.699 --> 34:42.370
As long as you don't say,
"here's looking at you, kid."

34:42.940 --> 34:43.889
I love you.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.170
I love you, too.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.670
Okay, go.

34:57.780 --> 34:59.440
Thank God I caught you.

34:59.470 --> 35:01.540
- Kit, they're in here.
- Kevin, I'm sorry. I have to go.

35:01.570 --> 35:05.040
- Sit down. You're not going anywhere.
- Kevin...

35:05.100 --> 35:07.040
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I...

35:07.040 --> 35:09.040
I can't believe I found you.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.580
Do you know how many bars
there are in this airport?

35:11.630 --> 35:12.820
What are you doing here, Kitty?

35:12.820 --> 35:16.400
Oh, Sarah. I c... I could
never let you guys do this.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.500
- Oh, Kitty.
- Oh, Sarah. I'm so sorry.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.670
- No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.060
I never should've let these
crazy people walk all over us...

35:23.080 --> 35:24.790
I should've just kept my mouth shut.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.370
No, you shouldn't have, and that's all...

35:26.400 --> 35:29.170
Girls, just get on with it. Please.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.340
Right. Right. Listen, Luc.
I... I don't want you to leave.

35:32.370 --> 35:34.400
You have three more
weeks on your old visa,

35:34.440 --> 35:36.800
and I think that we
should totally fight this.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.200
I... I'm sorry, Kitty, but I
think I've caused enough damage.

35:40.240 --> 35:43.300
- I... I...
- Listen, Kitty, I don't think I'm up for the fight.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.650
These... these people, they're relentless.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.700
And then there's a
zillion crazies out there

35:47.730 --> 35:50.670
- making up all kinds of lies.
- Kevin.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.300
- Yeah.
- Get me the douche bag.

35:53.340 --> 35:54.840
Okay, those are four words

35:54.870 --> 35:57.480
I never want to hear
from my sister. Kevin.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.270
- What?
- Just... just go. Get him.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.840
- Okay. Fine, fine.
- Kitty, what are you doing?

36:00.910 --> 36:01.720
Well, you know what?

36:01.740 --> 36:03.760
They hijacked our story,
and we're gonna reclaim it,

36:03.890 --> 36:05.400
even if it's just for us.

36:05.450 --> 36:07.130
So what, you're gonna tell that guy?

36:07.370 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, why not? Why not?

36:09.050 --> 36:11.200
I might be one voice
in the cyber wilderness,

36:11.220 --> 36:13.640
but better one than nothing.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.840
He made me promise you
wouldn't break his camera.

36:15.870 --> 36:17.420
I'll try to control myself.

36:17.430 --> 36:19.900
Oh, give me a break.
This isn't fun for me.

36:19.940 --> 36:21.780
Okay, let's roll it.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.950
Hi, I'm Kitty Walker-McCallister.

36:23.970 --> 36:26.700
And, uh, and... and this,
this is Sarah Walker.

36:26.740 --> 36:28.340
Hi.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.450
And she is a professional businesswoman,

36:31.500 --> 36:35.040
taxpayer, soccer mom and my sister.

36:35.070 --> 36:37.800
A... and this, this is Luc... Luc Laurent.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.070
And, other who takes no
jobs citizen from Americans.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.670
He loves Sarah and Sarah loves him.

36:46.700 --> 36:47.870
Hey.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.000
Wow. That was a big scene
at the airport today.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.510
- You saw it?
- It's popping up everywhere.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.290
I think you're about to go viral.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.850
You might want to rephrase that.

36:57.850 --> 37:01.400
Oh, right. That didn't come
out like I wanted it to.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.040
So how are you? How's life?

37:04.040 --> 37:06.380
I didn't want to wake you
when I came in last night,

37:06.430 --> 37:07.800
and all hell broke loose this morning.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.600
I feel like I haven't
seen you in two days.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.310
Well, remember that, uh, meeting

37:11.360 --> 37:13.480
- that I had with my boss the other day?
- Yeah.

37:13.770 --> 37:15.570
Uh, he closed the restaurant... for good.

37:15.890 --> 37:18.330
We're out of business. So that's how I am.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.200
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

37:22.230 --> 37:26.840
Yeah. I mean, timing could
not suck more, but I'm okay.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.680
Can I offer you some advice

37:31.730 --> 37:33.290
based on the last two days?

37:33.370 --> 37:36.740
- Don't answer the phone.
- No, I'm actually being serious.

37:37.530 --> 37:39.000
I swore up and down

37:39.000 --> 37:41.530
I was through with politics and lawyering,

37:41.530 --> 37:44.400
and I've done nothing
but for the past two days.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.840
But I'm glad I did,
because I'm good at it.

37:47.870 --> 37:49.940
And I wasn't working for anyone else.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.870
I was doing it for me

37:51.900 --> 37:54.500
and for my family, for love.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.590
It's time for you to
open your own restaurant.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.840
Oh, Kevin, that's a lovely thought.

38:00.870 --> 38:02.300
But collectively, we're jobless,

38:02.340 --> 38:03.860
we spent the majority of our savings

38:03.860 --> 38:06.100
- trying to make a baby...
- I know it'll be hard,

38:06.130 --> 38:08.930
but we'll figure out
a way to make it work.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.700
It's time for you to start dreaming big

38:12.930 --> 38:14.670
and do what you want to do.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.800
And you're ready for it.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.830
And you know I'm right.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.700
Kevin, look at you.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.920
You're making moves in the background

38:20.950 --> 38:22.290
for everybody else.

38:22.290 --> 38:25.160
You need to start doing what you love.

38:25.210 --> 38:26.260
I just need to figure out

38:26.310 --> 38:29.210
- exactly what that is first.
- Well, take your time.

38:29.230 --> 38:31.060
I can pick up some catering shifts

38:31.090 --> 38:32.960
to tide us over.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.110
Wait. Did you watch all of it?

38:37.160 --> 38:38.670
Uh, no, not yet.

38:38.690 --> 38:42.620
Oh, well, then you
haven't seen the best part.

38:44.180 --> 38:46.830
Now see, we come from a
very close-knit family.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.660
And we all look out for one another.

38:48.710 --> 38:51.120
And... and over the last
few days, I have had to watch

38:51.150 --> 38:53.580
Sarah and Luc suffer because
I happen to be running

38:53.580 --> 38:55.580
in a very noxious political climate.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.680
- And hey, listen.
- I'm sorry. Could I just interrupt?

38:57.700 --> 39:01.240
- Sure.
- Kitty never, ever intervened on Luc's behalf.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.940
No. And if... you can just
look at my platform to see

39:03.990 --> 39:06.500
that I actually believe
in legal immigration.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.430
I mean, in fact,

39:07.450 --> 39:09.470
I believe in increasing
our border control.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.160
Which I disagree with, actually.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.500
Well, yes, of course you do,

39:12.500 --> 39:14.450
because my sister is a flaming liberal.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
Ugh, but if you heard
her views on amnesty...

39:16.540 --> 39:18.900
- I mean, they're crazy.
- Uh, uh, Sarah.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.420
Not crazy. But very,

39:20.420 --> 39:22.960
- very... conservative.
- Conservative, yes.

39:22.980 --> 39:24.860
I'm a conservative. I know who I am.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.590
So if you are looking for a person

39:26.640 --> 39:28.250
- who believes in all that claptrap...
- Claptrap?

39:28.290 --> 39:30.140
- This is your woman.
- Sarah, that is not...

39:30.170 --> 39:31.590
Uh, you know what? You know what?

39:31.660 --> 39:32.830
Uh, let me interrupt here for a second.

39:32.850 --> 39:34.000
You see, this right here

39:34.020 --> 39:35.530
is what's so great about our family.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.120
We can despise each
other's political opinions,

39:38.140 --> 39:39.600
but we don't despise each other.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.650
And that is the spirit that
I want to take to Washington.

39:43.820 --> 39:45.160
You see, if I ever get to the point

39:45.160 --> 39:46.720
where my ideology is so rigid

39:46.800 --> 39:48.840
that I can't see another point of view

39:48.840 --> 39:52.040
or if my loyalty lies with my
party instead of my country,

39:52.040 --> 39:55.670
- well, then I want the voters to send me home.
- Yeah!

39:59.370 --> 40:01.200
And a couple of more things.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.830
She loves to be called Cat,

40:02.880 --> 40:04.780
so please do that as often as possible,

40:04.860 --> 40:06.170
and she's also very generous.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.170
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please step up to the bar,

40:09.220 --> 40:14.100
because drinks and food
are on her tab. Thanks, Cat.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.340
You want to get a drink?

40:29.134 --> 40:32.376
