00:47.113 --> 00:50.708
<i>- You think he sees us?</i>
<i>- No, he can't see us.</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:53.512
<i>But trust me, he can feel us watching.</i>

01:02.629 --> 01:06.656
Pop? Oh, that's a big one, Pop.
That's a big one here.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.391
Okay.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.093
He showed up.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.798
Ten-two. Come on, kid, you can do it.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.134
He's circling that little alcove
right there.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.265
This is all you, Kale. That's it.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.340
Try to put it right in front of him.
Right in front of him.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.106
See, you're talking to me,
and you're messing me up, Dad.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.976
Okay. Don't spook him.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.243
- Come on. There.
- There we go.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.339
Oh, that was perfect.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.249
Oh, he's taking it.
Look, he's following it.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.116
Easy. Easy.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.152
Dead drift. Dead drift.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.249
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- Easy. Easy. Come on, baby, take it.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.987
- Take it, baby.
- Bite, bite, bite!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.791
- He bit, he bit!
- Okay, easy.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.194
- That's it. Tip up. Tip up.
- Okay, okay.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.357
Do I let go? Do I let the line go?

01:40.467 --> 01:43.265
No, don't panic. Just let him take it.
If he wants to take it, let him take it.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.836
- Tip up. That's it.
- He got it. He's biting.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.530
I know. No, he's got it, baby. Come on.

01:46.639 --> 01:49.836
Okay, reel him in slow. Nice and slow.
Hold him.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.101
All right. All right.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.113
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's all right.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.243
It's okay. You did everything you could.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.783
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.547
You did everything you could.
Sometimes they just get away.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.316
Come on, let's take a break.
Come on, it's all right.

02:04.424 --> 02:07.359
If I can't catch a fish,
I don't know what I'm doing out here.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.394
- Beats working, right?
- What?

02:09.496 --> 02:11.293
Hold that. I said, it beats working.

02:11.397 --> 02:15.959
You're a writer. You work from home.
You ain't got it that tough, come on.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.502
- Here you go. You got it?
- Yeah.

02:25.612 --> 02:26.840
You know what?

02:26.946 --> 02:28.436
I really appreciate you bailing
on your friends

02:28.548 --> 02:31.176
to spend some time with your old man.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.212
It's not like you forced me
to be here, Pop.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.913
- No, I know, but I appreciate it.
- I appreciate it.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.616
Anything you want to talk about?
Anything...

02:38.725 --> 02:40.352
- What? What?
- No, it's just...

02:40.460 --> 02:42.724
- Is this that moment? This is that...
- Never mind.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.853
- No, no, this is that father-son...
- No, never...

02:44.964 --> 02:47.330
- No, I'm in.
- Forget I said it.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.459
I got something. Here's something.
You got a keen eye for this.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.435
- You're not gonna tell Mom?
- No, I won't say anything.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.439
No? All right. I'm having a kid.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.168
Yeah. You know,
your little boy's growing up.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.039
I got a girl pregnant,
and now I gotta go visit her.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.805
She lives in Reno.
I don't know how I'm gonna get there.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.505
I'll probably have to take Mom's car.

03:01.614 --> 03:04.105
But we're gonna live together.
We're gonna move into a trailer park.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.684
Yeah, her name's Shirley.
She's real great.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.117
- Yeah? She cute?
- Of course.

03:08.221 --> 03:12.351
Yeah. Good. That's all that counts.
Smart-ass. Let's fish.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.892
I'm gonna catch one before you.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.897
Yeah, but I don't mess with you
while you're fishing. That's the deal.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.771
No, Ma, we drained the entire...

03:25.872 --> 03:28.864
Literally every fish that was swimming
in the river is now in the trunk right now.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.710
- You're kidding.
<i>- No, I'm not kidding.</i>

03:31.811 --> 03:34.006
Yeah, are you sure you two aren't
stopping off and buying a fish,

03:34.113 --> 03:35.478
like you did last time?

03:35.582 --> 03:36.571
What?

03:36.683 --> 03:38.617
Are we gonna stop off and buy fish,
like the last time?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.050
No, no. Ma, come on.
We know you're too savvy for that.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.746
Oh, come on, look at this guy.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.413
Oh, come on! Jackass!

03:44.524 --> 03:46.048
<i>- Hey.</i>
- No, no, no. No, not you, Mom.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.490
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the phone.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.118
Hey, babe,
you should have seen him today.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.424
<i>We got enough fish for a week.</i>

03:51.564 --> 03:54.499
<i>- How long do you think you'll be?</i>
- I don't know. About an hour?

03:54.601 --> 03:55.568
Forty-five...

03:55.668 --> 03:56.692
Kale!

04:05.144 --> 04:06.372
Kale!

04:09.349 --> 04:10.316
Oh, God.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.317
Oh, God.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.482
Kale, are you okay?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.446
Dad.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.284
Kale!

05:05.204 --> 05:06.296
Dad?

05:44.410 --> 05:45.399
Move it!

06:25.284 --> 06:26.911
Yeah, keep dreaming, perv.

06:31.791 --> 06:32.780
Ronnie!

06:44.771 --> 06:46.204
<i>Se√±or</i> Brecht?

06:52.845 --> 06:53.903
Kale.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.646
So, Kale,

06:57.884 --> 07:00.045
think you can stay conscious
long enough to tell us

07:00.153 --> 07:02.917
your plans for the three wondrous

07:03.022 --> 07:04.751
summer months ahead?

07:06.793 --> 07:08.852
Do you want me to stand up?

07:14.233 --> 07:15.757
Summer months.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.586
I don't know what you just said.
I didn't read that far in the book.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.962
Did you do the homework or not?

07:48.401 --> 07:49.766
I guess not.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.328
You guess not?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.800
I don't know who you think you are,

07:57.443 --> 08:00.003
or who you think you're dealing with.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.910
You can't give me
a straight answer, fine.

08:03.382 --> 08:07.079
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fail you

08:07.520 --> 08:08.851
right now.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.819
What would your father think?

08:16.896 --> 08:18.693
No, Kale! No, no, no!

08:23.669 --> 08:25.466
Okay, Mr. Brecht.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.272
You're six months shy of 18.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.371
That means the Assault Two charge
you've pled guilty to carries a maximum

08:34.480 --> 08:36.277
of one year in juvie.

08:36.949 --> 08:39.577
With these priors, you're up to three.

08:40.887 --> 08:43.048
Losing a parent isn't easy,

08:44.090 --> 08:47.890
which is why I'm sentencing you
to three months house arrest.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.222
Mr. Brecht, I just cut you a break.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.264
Don't test me.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.064
Okay, you're all set to go nowhere.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.629
Now, green means you're good,
you're in the safe zone,

09:01.741 --> 09:04.904
which covers about
a 100-foot radius from this guy.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.104
You unplug it,
the police come immediately.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.237
He's like a modem.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.009
He gets a constant GPS signal
from Mr. Bracelet

09:11.117 --> 09:14.609
that goes through your phone line
to the monitoring systems downtown.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.210
So they know where you are,
where you've been

09:16.322 --> 09:17.812
and what you're thinking, 25/7.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.949
- What if he accidentally goes beyond...
- Red light flashes.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.994
You got 10 seconds
to get your butt back to green, or else.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.892
Or else what?
The execution squad shows up?

09:24.997 --> 09:27.056
And they don't bring blindfolds.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.599
It's tamper-proof and waterproof.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.363
So don't try to stick your foot in a bucket
of water and hop across the line.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.461
It won't work, and you'll look stupid.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.871
Now, here's the instructions.
Here's my card.

09:35.975 --> 09:36.999
Thank you.

09:37.109 --> 09:40.875
Are you all set up to pay
the incarceration fee, Mrs. Brecht?

09:41.180 --> 09:43.580
- No.
- $12. Every day.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.978
I accept all major credit cards.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.212
Great.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.048
My wallet's right over here.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.021
Officer.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.258
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Brecht.
- Thank you, really.

10:02.501 --> 10:03.934
Gutierrez?

10:04.203 --> 10:06.034
Your Spanish teacher,

10:06.639 --> 10:08.129
he's my cousin.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.803
Oh, one more thing. Listen up.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.937
House arrest might sound like a breeze,

10:15.047 --> 10:17.811
but I've seen many a folk get a bit loopy
after too long.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.782
Some after just a day or two.

10:19.885 --> 10:23.446
So find constructive things to do
to keep yourself busy.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.648
Boom! Nice shot.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.988
Okay, get my left flank.
There's two more at the entrance.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.585
Let me jump on the M60.
Cobra's at 3 o'clock.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.664
- Just get your position and hold it.
<i>- Do it now, man!</i>

10:32.765 --> 10:35.734
Just get your position and hold it.
Go down to the bottom entrance.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.564
Okay, here we go.
Here it comes, here it comes.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.035
- Just watch. Here it goes.
<i>- Shoot, now!</i>

10:39.138 --> 10:40.867
- Fired.
<i>- Come on!</i>

10:40.973 --> 10:43.737
Boom! Boom! Got it.
Okay, we got that. We got that.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.403
Now, follow me. Off the ledge.
There's a secret entrance at the bottom.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.107
Hello?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.945
You gotta be kidding me. Hello?

11:03.562 --> 11:07.999
<i>Alan stops by</i> Cheaters <i>to discuss</i>
<i>what's been eating at his conscience.</i>

11:08.100 --> 11:12.366
<i>Well, your camera busted in</i>
<i>on the situation that I guess I was in.</i>

11:12.471 --> 11:13.631
Uh-oh.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.041
Here she comes.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.734
<i>Hey! Where you going?</i>

11:17.843 --> 11:18.901
Caught you, bro.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.945
<i>Here. Come around here.</i>

11:21.047 --> 11:22.105
<i>What the... is going on?</i>

11:22.214 --> 11:23.738
<i>- Alan?</i>
- Come on.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.077
Man up, Alan.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.175
<i>- Open the... door.</i>
<i>- Alan?</i>

11:27.286 --> 11:29.413
<i>- What the...</i>
<i>- What the hell you doing?</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:30.546
<i>What the...</i>

11:30.656 --> 11:32.089
<i>Explain what you're doing</i>
<i>with Valerie's cousin?</i>

11:32.191 --> 11:34.659
<i>How the hell... How the...</i>

12:50.736 --> 12:51.896
<i>... Saint Tropez all the way to Cannes.</i>

12:52.004 --> 12:56.338
<i>It was so beautiful. There's nothing</i>
<i>like it, especially from the air.</i>

12:56.709 --> 12:59.337
<i>Parasail with us through the skies</i>
<i>over endless blue water.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:03.677
<i>Then shop Cabo's maze of streets,</i>
<i>alleyway stores and curios.</i>

13:04.750 --> 13:07.742
<i>Then we'll get adventurous</i>
<i>with the best in water sports.</i>

13:07.853 --> 13:11.516
<i>And, of course, the good stuff,</i>
chicas calientes.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.488

- No, it's news.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.844
You canceled my Xbox.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.412
iTunes, too.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.345
You know what else I'm canceling?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.008
Maid service.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.816
Look, Kale, I'm sorry you're a felon,
but this is not a vacation.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.484
I have two open houses today.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.529
I want you to clean up this room
and clean up the kitchen.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.528
I'll do that.
Let me just check my schedule.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.190
<i>If you have any information</i>
<i>on the whereabouts</i>

<i>has been set up at 1-800...</i>

Isn't that a little overdramatic?

14:02.608 --> 14:04.769
You don't think
I'm just gonna plug it back in?

14:04.877 --> 14:06.105
Dramatic?

14:10.783 --> 14:12.876
What are you gonna do now?

14:13.419 --> 14:14.886
Are you crazy?

14:15.554 --> 14:17.818
- Ma...
- That's dramatic.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.853
Clean up your room.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.263
Ronnie, you have no idea
how much this thing itches.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.664
Plus, my mother transformed.
She's a dictator now,

14:29.768 --> 14:32.236
like the warden from <i>Shawshank.</i>
And she took my Xbox.

14:32.338 --> 14:35.000
And my iTunes are gone, right?
And I can't go anywhere.

14:35.107 --> 14:37.735
I'm losing it. I'm losing my mind.
Just give me any information,

14:37.843 --> 14:39.242
anything at all.
What's going on out there?

14:39.345 --> 14:42.940
<i>You gotta see these Oahu chicks.</i>
<i>The natives are ferocious.</i>

14:43.048 --> 14:44.140
<i>This girl down by the pool,</i>

<i>to say "Lauhala-lana."</i>

- What does that mean?
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

14:48.754 --> 14:51.484
<i>- I think it's a Hawaiian mating call.</i>
- You're lying.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.553
Who's that with you? Is that...

14:54.660 --> 14:56.719
<i>Do you work here?</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?</i>

14:56.829 --> 14:59.195
No, no, don't do it. Ronnie. Ronnie.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.357
- Ronnie! Ronnie!
<i>- I've gotta go, bye.</i>

15:43.342 --> 15:47.039
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

15:47.413 --> 15:51.611
Oh, yeah, there we go. Yeah.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.119
Mary asked if I'd cover the hostess
stand a couple nights this week.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.320
So, I could be kind of late.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.336
Do you want to talk about anything?

16:13.872 --> 16:15.339
I got nothing.

16:46.305 --> 16:50.742
- I'm dropping this off in the garage.
- Oh, careful. Careful.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.472
It's a priceless family heirloom.
I don't have time to explain it.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.277
Put it downstairs.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.682
Get the boxes out first.

17:24.009 --> 17:27.069
Ashley, sweetie,
could you please come upstairs?

17:27.246 --> 17:30.181
- Be nice to your mom today, okay?
- I am being very nice.

17:30.282 --> 17:33.308
And we've got more stuff in the car,
so, you know, join in.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.415
Yeah, I'm coming!

17:40.526 --> 17:41.515
God.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.019
Yeah?

17:45.364 --> 17:47.298
Oh! Oh, shit.

17:51.837 --> 17:52.804
No!

17:55.174 --> 17:56.698
It's dog shit.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.646
What a retard!

18:03.582 --> 18:05.482
You little bastards.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.415
Bet you think that's real funny, huh?

18:07.519 --> 18:10.488
What are you gonna do?
Kill us, like you killed your teacher?

18:10.589 --> 18:13.820
Not before I shove this shit and my foot
back up your asses.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.325
Oh, crap!

18:19.865 --> 18:21.560
Dude, you said
he couldn't leave his house.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.066
He can't!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.332
Oh, shit.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.636
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

18:29.741 --> 18:32.039
Turn green! Turn green!

18:32.277 --> 18:35.440
Okay, here we are, back at home.
I'm good.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.907
Turn green. Come on.

18:38.016 --> 18:40.177
Come on! Turn green, I'm in!

18:40.652 --> 18:42.415
Turn green. Come on.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.982
Yes!

18:47.292 --> 18:49.351
Yes! Yes!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.759
Hey, are you okay?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.830
No, it's fine.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.136
I'm fine. It just... It turned. I'm green.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.273
No, no, no. Sir? Listen.
Officer, listen to me.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.440
I wasn't trying to go anywhere.
I wasn't trying to leave.

19:11.550 --> 19:15.042
There's a bag of shit on my stairs.
Two kids just...

19:15.721 --> 19:18.849
Honestly, they put a bag of shit
on my stairs and they lit it on fire.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.652
- Get down on the ground.
- There's a bag of shit on my...

19:20.759 --> 19:22.659
Get down on the ground!

19:24.129 --> 19:26.757
Get your hands behind your head.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.664
Somebody comes
and shits on my house?

19:28.767 --> 19:31.702
- Face down, face down.
- This is bullshit.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.131
Now give me your other hand.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.889
<i>Kale, calm down. The officers were</i>
<i>probably in the neighborhood already.</i>

19:51.990 --> 19:55.084
Yeah, but the cop that came,
that cop is my teacher's cousin.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.025
They're related.
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

19:57.129 --> 20:00.394
- Is there no other cops that can...
<i>- He didn't haul you away, right?</i>

20:00.532 --> 20:03.057
- No. No, he didn't. He...
<i>- Because first times happen.</i>

20:03.168 --> 20:04.635
- Right.
<i>- The officers knew that.</i>

20:04.736 --> 20:05.930
<i>Even your teacher's cousin.</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:09.235
<i>But next time you will be back</i>
<i>in front of a judge, all right?</i>

20:09.341 --> 20:10.899
Thank you.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.338
Little harder, Chad.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.025
Hi, pup.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.930
Come here.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.495
- You and me, both.
- Frankie! Frankie!

21:12.604 --> 21:14.663
- Where is he? Where is he?
- No, no, no.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.999
Frankie! Where are you?

21:17.509 --> 21:18.908
Frankie!

22:01.687 --> 22:04.679
- Mom?
- What'd you get?

22:04.790 --> 22:06.519
Just a couple things.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.991
You want to try them on for me?

22:09.094 --> 22:11.995
- Maybe later.
- Well, the pool's almost ready.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.406
<i>Aloha, Se√±or</i> Kale.

22:58.343 --> 23:02.006
Ronald! What's going on, bro?

23:02.781 --> 23:03.975
- Nothing.
- How you doing?

23:04.082 --> 23:06.778
- Oh, great. Have you been showering?
- Of course. Come on.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.045
- What is that?
- Macadamia nuts.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.950
That's all you got me?
Some stupid nuts?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.852
Hey, I got something to show you
that is most definitely...

23:11.957 --> 23:14.118
No, no. I got something to show you.
I got something to show you.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.784
This is reality without the TV.

23:15.894 --> 23:16.883
There's a world
right outside my window.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.929
- Look, look. Here we go.
- I have Maui chicks, man.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.157
There it is. Mrs. Pilch.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.824
And the Pilch dog.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.932
- Exciting.
- No, no, no, wait, it's not done.

23:25.036 --> 23:26.401
Look, and then she...
Look what she does.

23:26.505 --> 23:29.099
She says bye to Linda,
the maid they have at the house,

23:29.207 --> 23:31.607
who has a titty tat, you know.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.542
And then every Thursday at 4:00,
she goes to the country club

23:35.647 --> 23:37.672
and plays tennis
with Betty Big-Bangs over there.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.512
Okay, and then the ladies leave.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.314
Here we go. Cue Mr. Pilch,
coming back from work.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.820
- Fascinating.
- Here we go, here we go.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.914
Get up. Get up and look at this.
What do you think that's about, huh?

23:47.025 --> 23:49.721
He comes in. Here, take this.
Take this. Take it.

23:49.828 --> 23:53.730
Put that down. Look.
Look at the top, second story.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.490
- Who's there?
- Damn!

23:55.600 --> 23:57.568
Right? You see what I'm saying?
Here, come on.

23:57.669 --> 24:00.695
- Ronnie, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

24:01.673 --> 24:04.767
Oh, my God, you've made
the Tower of Twinkie.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.741
Is that in the <i>Stalker's Handbook</i>
somewhere?

24:06.845 --> 24:09.370
No, listen. That's not what I am, okay?
I'm not a stalker.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.848
These are just simple observations.
Natural side effects of chronic boredom.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.475
Find your passion, Kale.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.918
This is Robert Turner.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.120
And...

24:19.257 --> 24:21.657
He does that about twice a day.
Other than that, I don't really see him.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.353
Here's the little shitbagger sleeper cell
I was telling you about, remember?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.294
- Oh, the ding-dong ditch?
- Yeah, that's them.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.525
So what's the plan
for the counterattack?

24:28.633 --> 24:31.124
I don't know.
I'm keeping my options open.

24:31.236 --> 24:33.500
- The runt is mine.
- Here, come on.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.706
- What was that?
- Here, come on.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.637
Last stop on the tour.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.610
Here, come here. Come here.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.410
Oh, my God.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.725
There is a God.

25:01.700 --> 25:02.894
Yeah.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.304
Who is she?

25:11.977 --> 25:13.239
I don't know.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.142
What's stopping you?

25:45.844 --> 25:47.641
Come on.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.142
Shit. Oh, God.

25:56.922 --> 25:57.980
Can I help you?

25:58.089 --> 26:00.557
No, no, no. I'm fine, I got it. I got it.

26:00.659 --> 26:03.184
I'm real close.
It's just the bush has grown a little bit.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.162
Don't worry about it.
I do this all the time.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.891
Yeah, I can tell.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.860
I got these two.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.928
A little embarrassing,
I can't get my own mail.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.905
I think any pride you had left
was gone a while ago.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.167
Oh, you mean when the cops came.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.266
No, no, no.
That was a screw-up on their end.

26:19.377 --> 26:22.710
That wasn't me.
Wrong guy, wrong house, wrong...

26:23.048 --> 26:25.744
Wrong. Just wrong.
I'm Kale, by the way.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.479
So, how's your move going?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.389
- Still going.
- Yeah?

26:32.490 --> 26:35.118
I'd help. I'm just a little
spatially challenged at the moment.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.786
Yeah, you kinda got that whole
Martha Stewart thing going on.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.295
Yeah, kinda. Except I don't get, like,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.592
a 48-hour allowance for office visits.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.691
I'm not very good
at decorating pastries, either.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.201
It's not one of my strong suits.

26:45.303 --> 26:46.930
So, where'd you say you moved from?

26:47.038 --> 26:49.131
- I'm from the city.
- The city?

26:49.240 --> 26:51.435
And now, forcefully relocated.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.004
Ashley?

26:56.214 --> 26:58.375
Can you come in here, please?

26:58.750 --> 26:59.910
My mom.

27:00.685 --> 27:02.243
Yeah, I've been washing dishes
by hand.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.185
She's really polite
and always says "please,"

27:04.289 --> 27:06.917
but she has that tone, did you notice?

27:07.025 --> 27:08.856
Yeah, I know the tone.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.194
I'm Ashley, by the way.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.891
Noticed that, too.

27:21.873 --> 27:25.001
<i>Japan's earning season will</i>
<i>go into full swing this week, so...</i>

27:25.110 --> 27:26.236
<i>... weeks ago.</i>

27:26.344 --> 27:28.812
<i>A valet parking attendant says</i>
<i>an unidentified person</i>

27:28.913 --> 27:32.781
<i>picked up Williams sometime</i>
<i>between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.</i>

27:32.884 --> 27:36.149
<i>That individual was driving</i>
<i>a blue 1960s Ford Mustang,</i>

27:36.287 --> 27:37.948
<i>which may have been dented</i>
<i>on the left side.</i>

27:38.523 --> 27:40.457
<i>Police have released</i>
<i>a surveillance tape</i>

27:40.558 --> 27:42.526
<i>confirming the eyewitness account.</i>

27:42.627 --> 27:44.254
<i>But now, in the newest development,</i>

27:44.362 --> 27:48.628
<i>sources close to the investigation say</i>
<i>a review of the entire tape...</i>

28:02.947 --> 28:04.881
Started without me, huh?

28:09.254 --> 28:10.278
Nice.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.549
What are you stopping for?

28:21.166 --> 28:22.190
No.

28:30.608 --> 28:33.304
You can't see me. It's too dark in here.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.751
All right, you've done it.
You've pushed me right over the edge.

28:42.854 --> 28:46.381
Just look at me when I talk to you!
Now, listen...

28:47.459 --> 28:49.859
You've let me down, Ashley!

30:13.645 --> 30:14.976
A Mustang.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.776
- Oh, Jesus.
- Jesus.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.715
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me. I'm sorry.

31:26.818 --> 31:29.013
That's fine. It's fine.
I didn't hear you. You're like a ninja.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.678
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.517
What are you doing?

31:32.624 --> 31:36.321
Just staring out the window.
Staring at the wind. You know,

31:36.561 --> 31:37.823
getting creative.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.726
Well, I just wanted to say good night.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.196
- Well, good night. I love you.
- Okay.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.494
- I love you.
- Okay. Sleep good.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.501
Jesus, Ma.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.180
Hey.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.120
What are you doing?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.324
What are you doing?

32:47.365 --> 32:50.095
Looking at my garden? Is that it?

32:50.935 --> 32:53.403
You looking at my beautiful garden?

32:56.407 --> 32:58.432
Well, I caught you now.

32:59.377 --> 33:00.674
I got you.

33:07.518 --> 33:10.612
Yeah, you're not gonna
dig in my garden anymore.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.988
Nothing about missing bunnies,
but listen to this.

33:16.094 --> 33:18.562
Now the cops are saying
that the circumstances surrounding

33:18.663 --> 33:20.221
the girl's disappearance are similar

33:20.331 --> 33:23.858
to several murder-kidnappings
in Austin three years ago.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.863
All redheads.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.768
They didn't catch the guy,

33:28.873 --> 33:31.637
but they found seven chicks' bodies
in a house

33:31.743 --> 33:34.371
a year after the alleged killer
abandoned the property.

33:34.812 --> 33:37.975
No leads, no way of IDing
whoever lived there,

33:38.082 --> 33:40.516
'cause he used a fake name,
and probably a PO box,

33:40.618 --> 33:43.143
'cause no mail was ever delivered
to the house.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.380
Hello.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.720
Oh, here, check this. They got pictures.

33:47.825 --> 33:48.814
- Wow, that is sick.
- Hello.

33:48.926 --> 33:51.292
- Yo, you gotta see this. Check this...
- Movement.

33:51.396 --> 33:53.523
- We're going swimming.
- Okay.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.024
What do we have?

33:58.336 --> 34:00.827
Well, better late than never, right?

34:02.573 --> 34:04.871
Here we go. Here we go.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.209
I really, really like your neighborhood.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.543
- Well, that's new.
- We like new.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.558
It's so warm, baby.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.988
Okay, that's it. Cleansing breath. Can I?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.099
- Yeah.
- Okay.

34:32.703 --> 34:34.102
There we go.

34:34.605 --> 34:38.166
Okay, girl, you concentrate now.
This is for the gold.

34:38.776 --> 34:39.970
Oh, God!

34:43.614 --> 34:46.481
You're a jackass.
You are a genuine jackass.

34:46.584 --> 34:47.710
Seriously,
there's no way she heard that.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.152
I promise you, she heard it.
My deaf aunt in Omaha heard.

35:00.631 --> 35:01.620
Oh, no!

35:01.732 --> 35:03.256
- What?
- She just saw me. She saw me.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.391
- What?
- Yeah, she saw me.

35:04.502 --> 35:05.594
- She was looking up at me when...
- No.

35:05.703 --> 35:06.692
- No, no.
- Yeah, she saw me.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.135
There's no way she... See? She's...

35:08.239 --> 35:09.604
Okay, maybe she did.

35:09.740 --> 35:10.900
Really?

35:11.442 --> 35:12.636
Well, are her swims always that short?

35:12.743 --> 35:16.907
No, she usually takes her time with it.
That's what I'm telling you.

35:21.252 --> 35:24.312
Oh, God. And now she's gone.

35:27.091 --> 35:28.251
- No!
- No!

35:28.359 --> 35:29.621
It's nothing. It's not her.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.194
Well, listen, it could be her.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.354
- It's not, so...
- Okay, we'll check. We'll check.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.696
Well, no, no, I'm saying, if it's not her,
then you can let them go away.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.670
It's her at the door. It's her at the door.

35:40.771 --> 35:42.830
- No! No, no, no.
- Just look, look.

35:42.940 --> 35:47.604
- Shit! Don't, don't...
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop it. Okay.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.907
- Wait, wait, I got it.
- Oh, my God, we are so busted.

35:50.014 --> 35:52.414
- No, no, no! Wait! Don't answer it!
- I have to.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.577
She knows I'm here.
I got the thing on my foot.

36:00.725 --> 36:01.714
Hi.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.622
What took you so long?

36:03.728 --> 36:06.663
What... We were...
We were upstairs playing.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.266
- Video games!
- Yeah. Video games.

36:10.368 --> 36:13.064
This is my friend, Ronnie. Ronald.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.464
- Say hi, Ronald.
- Hi, Ronald.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.332
You're so stupid.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.905
So, what brings you here?
To my house?

36:21.445 --> 36:24.437
- I got locked out.
- Oh, that sucks.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.039
It's a tragedy.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.778
So, you gotta call someone?

36:32.323 --> 36:35.383
No, I'd rather stay stranded,
if you don't mind.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.560
Video games, huh? I like to play.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.391
Is this your room?

36:44.502 --> 36:47.403
Just so you know,
it's a little messy, okay?

36:47.572 --> 36:49.972
- A little?
- Yeah.

36:51.309 --> 36:54.039
Anything interesting out here?

36:55.112 --> 36:56.306
The...

36:57.815 --> 36:58.907
Okay.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.185
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.917
Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.087
Actually, he is.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.261
You see, he's got this neighbor,

37:13.364 --> 37:15.798
who I guess, by definition,
would also be your neighbor.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.924
Who may, in point of fact,

37:17.034 --> 37:18.399
- be a cold-blooded killer...
- Right.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.561
...from Texas.
- Right. Well, he's from Austin.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.400
- Yeah.
- Is that so?

37:22.506 --> 37:24.770
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...
- Exhibit A. Robert Turner.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.267
Yeah.

37:26.377 --> 37:28.368
Yeah, I've seen him. So?

37:28.479 --> 37:29.844
- So?
- So...

37:30.948 --> 37:33.314
Well, so, the missing girl's
from Madison?

37:33.417 --> 37:34.509
On the news.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.450
You think he has something
to do with that?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.044
He drives a car
just like the one she was

37:38.155 --> 37:39.383
- last seen in.
- Which is a '60s-era Mustang.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.479
A '60s-era Mustang.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.582
- Same color. Yeah.
- And it's the same color.

37:42.693 --> 37:44.456
Gee, that really narrows it down.

37:44.562 --> 37:47.725
Well, you know,
the news said that car was dented.

37:47.832 --> 37:50.323
- Yeah, and his front fender's dented.
- Yeah.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.832
- Right?
- It's cohesive.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.467
- It matches. The whole story.
- Yeah.

37:55.573 --> 37:56.767
It fits.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.474
Okay.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.980
I am seeing the Mustang.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.043
But no bashed-in fender.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.418
What? Yeah, no, it's there. It's there.

38:12.556 --> 38:16.048
If I could just... It should be there.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.855
That's weird.
How'd he get it fixed so fast?

38:20.965 --> 38:24.230
Maybe 'cause it was never there
in the first place.

38:26.003 --> 38:30.030
However, he is clearly a pack rat.

38:31.108 --> 38:32.871
He plays volleyball.

38:34.378 --> 38:37.313
- He collects skulls!
- What? Here, let me see.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.520
That's a longhorn skull.

38:43.788 --> 38:44.982
You know what state's famous
for longhorns.

38:45.089 --> 38:46.579
- Texas.
- And what state's the killer from?

38:46.691 --> 38:47.953
Texas.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.793
Fine. Where's the coffee and donuts?

38:53.397 --> 38:56.833
You can't have a stakeout
without coffee and donuts.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.671
That's everything I could find.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.235
Got most of it off of my uncle.
He's a type-A sociopath.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.744
How long has Turner lived there?

39:08.846 --> 39:10.837
I don't know. A few years.

39:11.382 --> 39:12.974
Hey, check this out.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.175
The victims they found in Texas
were preserved,

39:15.286 --> 39:17.311
delaying their decomposition.

39:17.421 --> 39:19.218
This guy was so sick.

39:19.523 --> 39:23.755
They say their bodies were twisted
and jammed into the basement walls.

39:24.261 --> 39:28.493
This girl died from blunt trauma,
most likely blows to the head and face.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.261
Gnarly. I'm hungry.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.931
Let's order pizza.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.035
He's been gone a while.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.297
Here.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.102
How'd you get my phone?

40:12.209 --> 40:14.040
That's a big violation of privacy,
you know.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.841
This is... I could turn you in for this.

40:18.783 --> 40:21.479
What did you do?
I know you did something.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.916
Every time he calls you,

40:26.824 --> 40:27.813
that's what you'll hear.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.019
Okay. That's a nice choice.

40:32.062 --> 40:33.120
Cute.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.362
It's a little scary, though, right?

40:36.467 --> 40:39.163
It could use a little color. Do you mind?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.207
No. Go for it, Picasso.

41:15.539 --> 41:20.238
So, why'd your parents drag you
to the 'burbs, anyway?

41:21.479 --> 41:25.575
Well, I guess my mom wanted
to keep my dad on a shorter leash.

41:26.951 --> 41:29.385
City life had its temptations.

41:30.421 --> 41:35.324
But my mom pretty much cries
just as much as she always did,

41:35.426 --> 41:38.054
and my dad doesn't care
more than ever.

41:40.030 --> 41:42.157
What'd they think,
the extra bathroom would help?

41:42.266 --> 41:43.426
Maybe a two-car garage.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.593
"You know what, honey?
Infidelity, forget about it.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.261
"Look at the storage space!"

41:47.371 --> 41:49.100
Something like that.

41:52.376 --> 41:54.571
So, what are your issues, Kale?

41:57.181 --> 41:59.206
What makes you think I have issues?

41:59.316 --> 42:00.943
Gee, I don't know.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.419
Look, there he is.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.090
It's another car.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.938
Who said chivalry's dead?

42:22.406 --> 42:23.634
I didn't.

42:24.808 --> 42:27.902
- There's a club girl for you.
- How can you tell?

42:28.913 --> 42:31.507
The bright green bracelet
is from The Place.

42:32.082 --> 42:35.347
The red one is from The Komodo Club,
and yellow is from Razors.

42:35.452 --> 42:38.114
Jesus. You must have a great ID, huh?

42:38.422 --> 42:40.049
I don't need one.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.116
I love her shoes.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.990
You gotta be joking.

42:45.429 --> 42:49.297
Is that what you're looking at? Shoes.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.634
Of course.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.005
He's going in.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.174
He's gonna get her all liquored up.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.102
This feels wrong.

43:03.547 --> 43:05.708
Oh, he's going for it.

43:07.351 --> 43:08.409
Okay.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.950
Here he goes. Here he goes.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.449
Denied.

43:15.492 --> 43:17.687
Look at the look on his face.

43:21.665 --> 43:23.963
A little music to set the mood.

43:24.501 --> 43:27.163
- What do you think they're listening to?
- I don't know.

43:28.172 --> 43:31.141
You know what? I got an idea.
Here, take this.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.542
- No.
- No?

43:41.352 --> 43:44.150
No. Stop, stop.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.020
- No.
- Yeah.

43:46.123 --> 43:48.023
- You're kidding me.
- I think we got a match.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.422
Oh, God.

43:51.996 --> 43:53.463
It does match.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.458
Only in Disturbia.

43:56.333 --> 43:59.791
Where else are you gonna get
this kind of entertainment?

43:59.903 --> 44:03.168
- Thank God you moved here, right?
- Yeah.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.316
Wait a minute.

44:13.751 --> 44:16.811
Wait, did you see that?
Wait, zoom in a little.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.997
Oh, my God.

44:45.482 --> 44:47.541
Did you see that? The price tag.

44:47.651 --> 44:50.017
She won't be returning that dress.

44:56.960 --> 45:00.054
Oh, there you go.
Now you should bust your move.

45:04.635 --> 45:06.296
Who's the redhead?

45:06.937 --> 45:09.337
- She's cute.
- Don't you have something to do?

45:09.440 --> 45:10.805
Don't you have something to do?

45:10.908 --> 45:12.375
- No.
- Your...

45:14.578 --> 45:18.207
Yeah. My dad likes this song,
by the way.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.654
Hi, Mom.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.720
- Here we go.
- No, I'm fine.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.666
I'm at Barnes & Noble.

45:39.269 --> 45:41.362
No, that's okay, I'll walk.

45:42.606 --> 45:44.733
Shift's over. Gotta go.

45:46.477 --> 45:47.705
Walk me?

45:49.079 --> 45:50.137
Sure.

45:50.981 --> 45:52.141
Give this to your mom.

45:56.119 --> 45:59.885
Thank you for an interesting night
and day.

46:05.329 --> 46:07.729
I guess this is as far as you go.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.657
I guess so.

46:14.238 --> 46:16.229
So, same shift tomorrow?

46:21.712 --> 46:23.475
I'll get back to you.

46:48.071 --> 46:50.130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

46:55.846 --> 46:57.473
Somebody, anybody.

46:59.549 --> 47:02.347
Somebody, anybody.

47:08.258 --> 47:09.987
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

47:12.529 --> 47:13.894
Hello, boys.

47:19.469 --> 47:21.096
Family fun night.

47:22.873 --> 47:26.274
Okay. I see what's going on.

47:27.477 --> 47:30.640
Oh, Jesus. You guys are screwed now.

47:32.249 --> 47:34.183
"We're just watching cartoons."

47:34.284 --> 47:38.653
"Oh, okay, sweetie. I understand.
You guys are growing boys."

47:40.891 --> 47:42.324
Come on, Mom.

47:45.095 --> 47:49.498
Bastards. Wow, they are horny as shit.

47:50.534 --> 47:54.231
Help! Help!

48:27.270 --> 48:28.737
Shit, come on.

48:34.010 --> 48:35.409
Oh, shit.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.721
Okay. Oh, God.

49:33.670 --> 49:34.762
- Ronnie.
<i>- How far did you get?</i>

49:34.871 --> 49:37.237
Ronnie, listen to me. Okay.
Turner just saw me.

49:37.340 --> 49:38.432
<i>- What?</i>
- Yeah.

49:38.542 --> 49:40.737
And the redhead
who was at his house, okay?

49:40.844 --> 49:41.970
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- He chased her around the house,

49:42.078 --> 49:44.273
and it got dark, he turned the lights out.

49:44.381 --> 49:47.748
I mean, I don't know what I saw. I saw...
Well, what if he killed her? I mean...

49:47.851 --> 49:51.150
<i>Slow down, slow down. Talk to me.</i>
<i>What is happening?</i>

49:52.289 --> 49:54.723
- Just stay on the phone.
<i>- Kale?</i>

49:54.825 --> 49:56.986
Okay, just stay on the phone.

49:59.229 --> 50:01.424
<i>Are you seeing something?</i>

50:06.203 --> 50:08.137
<i>Kale, what is happening?</i>

50:11.541 --> 50:13.133
<i>Talk to me, man.</i>

50:14.144 --> 50:17.011
It's the redhead.
She's leaving the house.

50:17.814 --> 50:20.681
<i>You are seriously losing it,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

50:20.851 --> 50:23.445
<i>You gotta stop this, all right, Kale?</i>

50:24.688 --> 50:25.848
<i>Kale?</i>

51:07.531 --> 51:09.692
- No!
- No, no, no! Whoa.

51:09.799 --> 51:11.767
Whoa. Just take it easy.

51:12.802 --> 51:14.394
Easy. Slow down.

51:15.639 --> 51:17.504
I'm Robert Turner. I'm your neighbor.
I just live behind you...

51:17.607 --> 51:19.905
Yeah, I know who you are!
What are you doing in my house?

51:20.010 --> 51:22.069
- Well, I...
- Morning, honey!

51:23.013 --> 51:24.537
I think I startled him.

51:24.648 --> 51:29.347
I ran into Robert at the grocery store.
I had a flat tire when I came out.

51:29.619 --> 51:32.247
We tried to change it,
but that adaptor thingamajiggy...

51:32.355 --> 51:33.720
Yeah, my dad put those bolts on.

51:33.823 --> 51:36.087
Well, it did not work.
Instead it stripped it.

51:36.192 --> 51:37.716
- My fault.
- No.

51:38.295 --> 51:39.922
You saved my life.

51:41.865 --> 51:43.856
We had it towed to Frank's.

51:43.967 --> 51:45.901
Oh, yeah?
Thank God you were there, huh?

51:46.002 --> 51:48.197
- To tow it to Frank's.
- Just glad I could help.

51:48.305 --> 51:50.034
Kale, would it kill you
to use a bread knife?

51:50.140 --> 51:51.505
It's a knife. What's the difference?

51:51.608 --> 51:54.873
Well, the difference?
About 60 bucks at Bed Bath.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.813
Hey, you know, those things...

51:59.916 --> 52:01.144
I've always been curious
about those things.

52:01.251 --> 52:04.414
- Do you mind if I just take a look?
- Yeah, I mind.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.054
- So what'd you do?
- How do you like your coffee?

52:08.158 --> 52:10.251
I popped my Spanish teacher.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.400
Shoot, I think I left the milk in the car.
I'll be right back.

52:32.916 --> 52:35.214
So, when you say that you

52:36.553 --> 52:40.148
- popped your teacher...
- Yeah, I punched him in the face.

52:42.225 --> 52:43.624
Listen,

52:44.728 --> 52:46.252
I get it.

52:46.529 --> 52:48.759
I went to school.

52:50.300 --> 52:54.327
There are plenty of teachers
I wanted to just kill.

52:57.641 --> 53:00.542
Kale, would you grab the sugar, please?

53:04.080 --> 53:05.411
Here it is.

53:06.449 --> 53:08.076
Can I pour you some milk?

53:11.054 --> 53:14.319
On the way back here, your mom was
saying how much she likes eating out.

53:14.424 --> 53:15.618
Was she?

53:17.327 --> 53:19.056
I thought maybe we could do dinner
and a movie sometime...

53:19.162 --> 53:21.653
- That's not gonna happen.
- I would like that. It'd be good.

53:21.765 --> 53:23.790
For me. For me it's not gonna happen.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.891
But I'm sure my mother would love
to go, huh, Ma?

53:26.002 --> 53:28.766
- You'd love that.
- Why don't we sit down?

53:28.872 --> 53:30.737
Nice meeting you, Kale.

53:34.511 --> 53:38.174
- He is something.
- Yes, he really is something.

53:39.182 --> 53:40.774
And so is your place.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.284
That's creepy.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.547
I said it, I told you.
The guy's a freak show, right?

53:45.655 --> 53:47.555
Did he genuinely mean
it was nice meeting you,

53:47.657 --> 53:50.922
or was he sending you
some kind of sinister message?

53:51.728 --> 53:54.253
- Are you playing with me?
- A little.

53:55.498 --> 53:58.592
- Did you even notice my hair?
- Yeah, no, it's nice.

53:58.702 --> 54:00.567
It's real nice. Okay, there's the Mustang.

54:00.670 --> 54:02.604
Then there's the longhorn skull
in his garage.

54:02.706 --> 54:04.071
And then there was the club girl.

54:04.174 --> 54:06.074
Who looked freaked out, okay?
She looked freaked out.

54:06.176 --> 54:08.144
She was running around half-naked
in his living room.

54:08.244 --> 54:09.973
Then he challenges me.
He stares at me.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.378
He shows up in my kitchen,
hits on my mother.

54:12.482 --> 54:14.040
- I mean...
- Can you blame him?

54:14.150 --> 54:15.674
Your mom's hot.

54:17.754 --> 54:19.244
My mom's hot. Can you be serious?

54:19.355 --> 54:20.913
Did you consider whatever look
that girl had

54:21.024 --> 54:23.151
might have been something else?

54:24.027 --> 54:27.121
Maybe she likes being
chased around half-naked.

54:30.533 --> 54:32.330
And that's it?
That's what you're leaving me with?

54:32.435 --> 54:33.902
I'm going to a party.

54:34.003 --> 54:35.698
- Whose?
- Mine.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.866
Yours?

54:38.408 --> 54:40.603
You're having a...
I didn't mean to say it like that.

54:40.710 --> 54:41.938
I just didn't know you knew anyone.

54:42.045 --> 54:43.535
I met this girl today, Minnie Tyco.

54:43.646 --> 54:46.046
Minnie... Yes, "Skinny Psycho."
Yeah, I had Spanish with her.

54:46.149 --> 54:47.173
She's a lot of fun.

54:47.283 --> 54:50.582
I told her my parents were going out
of town, and one thing led to another.

54:50.687 --> 54:52.416
She called somebody,
and then they called somebody,

54:52.522 --> 54:55.082
- and now, everybody's coming.
- Yeah, no, I got it, I got it.

54:55.191 --> 54:57.921
So now you got the whole jock
and bimbo population showing up?

54:58.027 --> 54:59.892
Well, that'll be fun.

55:04.134 --> 55:06.796
So you're really going through with this?

55:06.903 --> 55:07.927
Yes.

55:10.473 --> 55:11.531
All right, well, that'll be fun.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.940
I just didn't think
you would conform so fast but...

55:16.513 --> 55:19.914
Try to keep those
in your drawers tonight, will you?

55:41.004 --> 55:44.064
Wait, what was that?
Oh, you think I'm watching you.

55:45.375 --> 55:49.175
Well, I'm not. I'm not watching.
I'm minding my own business.

55:58.621 --> 56:00.987
Hey, how are you?

56:09.599 --> 56:11.965
All right, that's it. That's it!

56:44.067 --> 56:45.398
Oh, my God.

57:09.392 --> 57:12.418
- You don't like Minnie Riperton?
- Fire!

57:12.528 --> 57:15.588
I hit him, you guys! Go, you guys!
Go, go, go, go!

57:15.698 --> 57:17.689
I got you now, Greenwood!

57:17.800 --> 57:21.429
- Oh, my God! Go!
- You better not be listed!

57:24.974 --> 57:27.534
Big tactical error, my friend. Huge!

57:33.149 --> 57:34.878
What the...

57:36.653 --> 57:39.349
What are you doing here? Huh?

57:39.455 --> 57:41.650
Oh! No! Wait.

57:42.859 --> 57:45.555
What's wrong?
You don't like my music?

57:52.702 --> 57:54.727
- Oh, my God.
- What?

57:55.071 --> 57:56.868
Oh, shit. Hold on.

57:57.106 --> 57:59.097
Back off, or I will throw this
where you can't follow.

57:59.208 --> 58:01.369
Okay, just relax, okay?
That's 60 gigs of my life.

58:01.477 --> 58:02.842
Even better.

58:04.380 --> 58:06.245
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

58:06.349 --> 58:07.646
I'm trying to enjoy my party.

58:07.750 --> 58:09.615
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Oh, no, wait.

58:09.719 --> 58:12.279
That's wrong.
According to you, I'm trying to conform.

58:12.388 --> 58:14.788
- Well, you could have fooled me.
- What does that mean?

58:14.891 --> 58:17.121
I'm saying, if you're trying
to enjoy your party, enjoy your party.

58:17.226 --> 58:20.354
Don't keep looking up at me, trying
to get a rise out of me. It's unnecessary.

58:20.463 --> 58:22.397
So, you were watching me.

58:22.865 --> 58:25.163
But for how long? Just tonight?

58:25.935 --> 58:28.733
A week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?

58:29.939 --> 58:32.635
What have you been
keeping tabs on, Kale?

58:34.043 --> 58:35.977
What else have you seen?

58:36.212 --> 58:38.305
- What else have I seen?
- Yeah. What else?

58:42.285 --> 58:43.946
I've seen a lot.

58:44.420 --> 58:47.116
I mean, not like that. Not... I mean...

58:48.725 --> 58:51.853
For instance, I've seen that you're

58:53.129 --> 58:55.757
maybe one of, I don't know,
three people in the world

58:55.865 --> 58:58.231
that likes pizza-flavored chips.

58:58.768 --> 59:01.032
You're also the only person
I've ever seen that spends more time

59:01.137 --> 59:04.300
on the roof of her house
than in her actual house.

59:04.907 --> 59:07.171
And what are you doing?
You're reading.

59:07.276 --> 59:11.372
Books. You know, not <i>US Weekly,</i>
or <i>Seventeen</i> or, you know...

59:11.581 --> 59:14.175
But you're reading substantial books.

59:14.650 --> 59:16.447
You also do this...

59:17.553 --> 59:21.887
You do this thing where,
it's like an OCD thing, but it's not. It's...

59:21.991 --> 59:24.926
Whenever you're leaving your room,
you grab the doorknob, and you turn,

59:25.028 --> 59:27.326
you're getting ready to leave,
but you don't, you stop,

59:27.430 --> 59:31.799
and you back up, and you turn
to the mirror, and you stare at yourself.

59:31.901 --> 59:35.496
But it's not like a, you know,
"I'm so hot," type of stare.

59:35.638 --> 59:37.936
You know, it's more like,

59:38.741 --> 59:40.436
"Who am I, really?"

59:41.577 --> 59:45.604
And to ask yourself that, I mean, that's...

59:47.483 --> 59:49.280
That's so cool.

59:53.389 --> 59:55.516
Also, you look out the window
all the time, like I do,

59:55.625 --> 59:58.685
only you're looking at the world,
you know.

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:03.460
Trying to figure it out.
Trying to understand the world.

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:07.366
Trying to figure out why it's not in order,
like your books.

1:00:17.380 --> 1:00:19.541
I'm only looking at you.

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:28.848
That's either the creepiest

1:00:31.327 --> 1:00:34.228
or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

1:00:55.318 --> 1:00:58.947
Remember the other night?
When we talked about my issues?

1:01:00.523 --> 1:01:03.788
- You said you didn't have issues.
- Did I?

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:08.218
That was bullshit. I got a million issues.

1:01:12.802 --> 1:01:15.327
For a guy who killed his teacher?

1:01:16.172 --> 1:01:18.140
I didn't kill my teacher.

1:01:29.585 --> 1:01:30.677
What?

1:01:39.695 --> 1:01:41.458
- Holy shit.
- What?

1:01:47.770 --> 1:01:49.032
What's in the bag?

1:01:49.138 --> 1:01:51.072
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1:01:53.776 --> 1:01:56.404
- What'd you see?
- Red smears.

1:01:58.614 --> 1:02:02.277
- Blood?
- What should we do?

1:02:04.987 --> 1:02:07.182
<i>I can't believe you want me</i>
<i>to break into this guy's car.</i>

1:02:07.290 --> 1:02:08.450
We need to see what's in the blue bag.

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.492
So, get in the car and get
the garage door opener, all right?

1:02:10.593 --> 1:02:12.993
<i>Are you sure I'm still in the clear?</i>

1:02:13.095 --> 1:02:14.392
Ashley, where's Turner now?

1:02:14.497 --> 1:02:17.466
He's shovel shopping.

1:02:22.538 --> 1:02:24.403
Visual coming your way.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.843
<i>Are you sure I'm clear?</i>

1:02:28.978 --> 1:02:30.775
Yeah, you're golden, man.
He's still in the store.

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:32.711
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1:02:46.329 --> 1:02:48.854
- Well, that's pretty cool.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

1:02:48.965 --> 1:02:50.899
Ashley's got, like, a live feed going here.

1:03:01.344 --> 1:03:03.141
<i>This is a lot harder than it looks</i>
<i>on the Internet.</i>

1:03:03.246 --> 1:03:06.113
You're doing great, man.
You're doing great.

1:03:25.801 --> 1:03:27.098
Ashley!

1:03:27.536 --> 1:03:30.562
- Hi!
- Hi, Skinny Minnie.

1:03:34.310 --> 1:03:36.505
Where did you hear that name?

1:03:36.746 --> 1:03:40.079
- Hello? Ashley? Hello. Ashley.
<i>- Son of a bitch. I'm in.</i>

1:03:40.182 --> 1:03:42.013
There you go!
Nice. All right, start looking around.

1:03:42.118 --> 1:03:43.312
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Look under the seat, too.

1:03:43.419 --> 1:03:45.319
In side compartments, glove box,
the whole nine.

1:03:45.454 --> 1:03:48.719
<i>- It's not here, dawg.</i>
- Nothing? All right.

1:03:48.858 --> 1:03:51.292
All right, keep looking. Hold on.

1:03:51.394 --> 1:03:53.555
- Yes.
- Kale, I lost Turner.

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:55.631
I ran into Skinny Psycho.

1:03:55.731 --> 1:03:58.131
You lost...
When is the last time you saw him?

1:03:58.234 --> 1:04:00.202
I don't know. About five minutes ago.
His car's gone.

1:04:00.303 --> 1:04:01.634
All right, hold on.

1:04:01.737 --> 1:04:03.568
- Okay. Ronnie.
<i>- Yo, yo, here, I found his opener!</i>

1:04:03.673 --> 1:04:06.107
Okay, listen to me. Pop it open
and give me the code, okay?

1:04:06.208 --> 1:04:07.175
Pop it open
and give me the code right now.

1:04:07.276 --> 1:04:08.243
<i>No, no, but it looks like</i>

1:04:08.344 --> 1:04:09.470
<i>I can just open the garage right now.</i>

1:04:09.578 --> 1:04:11.239
No, Ronnie, don't do that.
Don't do that, Ronnie.

1:04:11.347 --> 1:04:13.679
Just give me the code, okay?

1:04:13.783 --> 1:04:15.444
<i>- Why do you sound so agitated?</i>
- Okay, listen.

1:04:15.551 --> 1:04:17.382
Ashley just lost Turner,
who's coming home right now.

1:04:17.486 --> 1:04:20.046
That's why I'm agitated.
I need you to read me the code. Okay?

1:04:20.156 --> 1:04:22.090
- So, pop it open and give it to me.
<i>- What? Oh, no, no, no.</i>

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:23.624
<i>Operation Stupid is officially over.</i>

1:04:23.726 --> 1:04:25.557
No! Ronald, no! Listen to me.

1:04:25.661 --> 1:04:27.720
Stop right there, turn around
and give me the code.

1:04:27.830 --> 1:04:30.390
Pop it open and give me the code!
You're right there!

1:04:30.499 --> 1:04:33.332
Pop it open and go.
Pop it open and give it to me, Ronald.

1:04:33.436 --> 1:04:36.428
<i>I can't get this... I can't...</i>
<i>It's not opening, okay?</i>

1:04:36.539 --> 1:04:38.530
Okay, keep trying. Hold on. Hello?

1:04:38.641 --> 1:04:40.040
Kale, you've gotta get Ronnie
out of there. Now!

1:04:40.142 --> 1:04:41.166
Yeah, I know, I know. He's got the code.

1:04:41.277 --> 1:04:42.244
He's giving it to me right now.

1:04:42.345 --> 1:04:44.643
Well, tell him to hurry. Shit!

1:04:45.081 --> 1:04:46.343
Okay, okay, okay.

1:04:46.449 --> 1:04:47.541
Hello? Ronald, go.

1:04:47.650 --> 1:04:49.550
<i>Are you ready? It's one down.</i>

1:04:50.252 --> 1:04:51.685
Miss Carlson.

1:04:53.756 --> 1:04:54.745
Kale.

1:04:55.024 --> 1:04:58.289
<i>Three up, four up. No, no, no.</i>
<i>Sorry, I screwed that.</i>

1:04:58.394 --> 1:04:59.486
Okay. Up?

1:04:59.595 --> 1:05:00.823
<i>Four down.</i>

1:05:00.930 --> 1:05:01.988
Kale?

1:05:04.934 --> 1:05:05.923
Hi.

1:05:06.869 --> 1:05:08.496
I'm Robert Turner.

1:05:09.538 --> 1:05:11.165
I live behind you.

1:05:11.607 --> 1:05:12.904
Oh, yeah.

1:05:23.119 --> 1:05:24.609
Would you mind?

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:27.579
It's just a little rude.

1:05:31.394 --> 1:05:32.725
What are you doing?

1:05:32.828 --> 1:05:37.561
Well, I'm officially welcoming you
to the neighborhood.

1:05:40.936 --> 1:05:43.336
I know that you've been following me.

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.304
Don't. No, don't.

1:05:46.142 --> 1:05:47.609
Don't deny it.

1:05:50.379 --> 1:05:54.839
I'm not upset. And, quite frankly,
I don't even want to know why.

1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:00.588
I just would like you to know that

1:06:02.558 --> 1:06:04.719
I'm a little on the shy side.

1:06:05.394 --> 1:06:09.353
So, short of all this sneaking around

1:06:09.598 --> 1:06:13.728
in some kind of hip, new-aged way

1:06:13.836 --> 1:06:17.533
of coming on to a somewhat older man,

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:23.278
I really feel obliged to tell you

1:06:23.379 --> 1:06:26.610
that I rather enjoy my privacy.

1:06:30.886 --> 1:06:35.346
You see, the world is...
It's in a heightened state of paranoia.

1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:40.452
And I tend to think that someone
as intelligent

1:06:40.563 --> 1:06:44.329
and attractive as you

1:06:45.534 --> 1:06:49.698
doesn't need to be wasting her time
stoking the fire.

1:06:50.473 --> 1:06:51.462
I...

1:06:56.979 --> 1:06:59.243
So, now you know.

1:07:00.049 --> 1:07:02.711
You're not the only one who's watching.

1:07:12.328 --> 1:07:15.297
So, feel free to pass that along
if you'd like.

1:07:19.068 --> 1:07:20.228
Cool?

1:07:22.004 --> 1:07:23.062
Are we cool?

1:07:23.172 --> 1:07:24.833
Cool. Cool.

1:07:25.574 --> 1:07:26.632
Cool.

1:07:35.684 --> 1:07:38.084
All right. That's it. Give me the phone.
I'm calling the cops.

1:07:38.187 --> 1:07:40.485
Wait. He didn't do anything.

1:07:40.789 --> 1:07:42.256
All he said was that he liked his privacy.

1:07:42.358 --> 1:07:44.792
But think about that.
Why does he want his privacy?

1:07:44.894 --> 1:07:46.156
I mean, he's hiding something.
We know that.

1:07:46.262 --> 1:07:47.388
- Yeah, definitely.
- Right?

1:07:47.496 --> 1:07:49.430
And he knows that we know that.
He knows that.

1:07:49.532 --> 1:07:53.468
And regardless of if he had a bad day
or a good... It doesn't matter.

1:07:53.569 --> 1:07:55.196
He scared the hell out of you.
That's a grown man.

1:07:55.304 --> 1:07:58.432
Look, Kale, he freaked me out,
but he's right.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:07:59.803
We're the ones spying.

1:07:59.909 --> 1:08:02.343
Oh, man,
she's got that Stockholm thing.

1:08:02.444 --> 1:08:05.675
You know, where the hostage
falls for the hostage taker.

1:08:05.781 --> 1:08:08.147
- Where do you get this stuff?
- I read a lot.

1:08:08.284 --> 1:08:11.378
Okay. I got a...
How is that a nice or charming guy?

1:08:11.487 --> 1:08:13.785
- I didn't say that.
- No, okay, Ash, what you said was...

1:08:13.889 --> 1:08:16.687
You said, "He broke into my car,
but he did it in a nice way."

1:08:16.792 --> 1:08:19.727
- Maybe I'm not understanding.
- Okay, you know what?

1:08:19.828 --> 1:08:21.921
- Can we just...
- Drop this?

1:08:22.264 --> 1:08:25.131
This is obviously not
a cute little game anymore.

1:08:25.234 --> 1:08:27.225
This has gone way too far.

1:08:30.873 --> 1:08:33.808
Hi. No, I'm not over here.

1:08:36.712 --> 1:08:38.304
Okay, I'm coming.

1:08:41.684 --> 1:08:44.312
Parents' anniversary,
amazingly enough.

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:48.218
Just drop this, okay?

1:08:48.357 --> 1:08:50.086
I'll call you later.

1:09:11.981 --> 1:09:13.471
<i>This is Ronnie. Make it good.</i>

1:09:13.582 --> 1:09:15.709
Ronnie, I did some research
on Turner's house, okay?

1:09:15.818 --> 1:09:18.719
I'm looking at the blueprints, and it says
that when this house was first built,

1:09:18.821 --> 1:09:21.255
this main house and the garage
weren't connected.

1:09:21.357 --> 1:09:22.517
And now there's
this whole middle piece.

1:09:22.625 --> 1:09:25.185
That middle piece wasn't there.
I mean, what would he need that for?

1:09:25.294 --> 1:09:28.058
I'm just thinking out loud. Call me back.

1:10:06.935 --> 1:10:09.836
- Who is it?
- It's Ronnie, man! Come on!

1:10:09.938 --> 1:10:11.428
- Did you get my message?
- What? No, listen.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:14.031
- I dropped my phone in his car!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:10:14.143 --> 1:10:15.440
- Wait.
- I went home, it wasn't in my pockets.

1:10:15.544 --> 1:10:17.409
I must have put it down
when I was putting the thing back on.

1:10:17.513 --> 1:10:18.502
- Okay, okay, stop.
- I don't want to...

1:10:18.614 --> 1:10:19.581
Are you understanding what I'm saying?

1:10:19.682 --> 1:10:21.513
Okay, look!
We're gonna get your phone, okay?

1:10:21.617 --> 1:10:23.551
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna get your phone.

1:10:23.652 --> 1:10:25.813
But I need you to do
one more thing for me.

1:10:28.891 --> 1:10:32.918
<i>- Yeah. Okay. Okay.</i>
- You there?

1:10:33.028 --> 1:10:35.019
<i>How am I looking? Can you see this?</i>

1:10:35.130 --> 1:10:36.563
Yeah, you're good. I see you.

1:10:36.665 --> 1:10:40.465
<i>Okay, how does it look over there?</i>
<i>Am I... Is anything moving?</i>

1:10:41.937 --> 1:10:43.268
<i>How am I looking?</i>

1:10:43.372 --> 1:10:45.670
- Yeah, you're good to go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1:10:56.151 --> 1:10:58.278
There you go. There you go.

1:11:01.790 --> 1:11:04.350
<i>Wait, is this... You still got a signal?</i>

1:11:04.460 --> 1:11:08.226
Yeah, no, I see you, I see you.
Do it from around the corner.

1:11:10.299 --> 1:11:11.732
There you go.

1:11:14.303 --> 1:11:16.498
<i>Are you sure I'm still clear?</i>

1:11:16.805 --> 1:11:18.773
No movement. You're fine.

1:11:24.546 --> 1:11:27.071
<i>Oh, God. I made a lot of noise.</i>
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

1:11:27.182 --> 1:11:28.581
You're good.

1:11:30.419 --> 1:11:32.284
<i>Oh, man, it reeks in here.</i>

1:11:32.521 --> 1:11:36.184
- What's it smell like?
<i>- Like the corpse of a rotting hottie.</i>

1:11:36.291 --> 1:11:38.555
<i>Okay, yes, the door's unlocked.</i>

1:11:41.697 --> 1:11:44.359
<i>I'm not seeing it, man. It's not in here.</i>

1:11:44.466 --> 1:11:45.797
Just keep looking. It's there.
Just calm down.

1:11:45.901 --> 1:11:47.334
Just be patient, you'll find it.

1:11:47.436 --> 1:11:50.098
<i>Oh, God, yes. Okay, I got it. I got it.</i>

1:11:50.405 --> 1:11:52.703
<i>- Oh, thank you, thank you.</i>
- There you go.

1:11:52.808 --> 1:11:54.435
Okay. Okay. Now listen.

1:11:54.543 --> 1:11:58.001
- You gotta find the bag.
<i>- Okay. All right. Okay.</i>

1:11:58.947 --> 1:12:01.438
<i>I don't see it.</i>
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>

1:12:01.550 --> 1:12:05.077
<i>I see it, I see it. Do you see this?</i>

1:12:05.187 --> 1:12:07.587
There it is. Good job. Good job.

1:12:08.357 --> 1:12:10.382
- Okay.
<i>- All right, okay, okay.</i>

1:12:10.492 --> 1:12:13.484
<i>I just gotta put the camera down</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

1:12:15.731 --> 1:12:19.064
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>This is definitely the source of the stink.</i>

1:12:19.535 --> 1:12:22.026
<i>Bro, I don't want to do this anymore.</i>
<i>I want to come home.</i>

1:12:22.137 --> 1:12:25.231
Just stay calm. Stay calm.
I need you to look in the bag.

1:12:25.340 --> 1:12:28.434
<i>God, there's a lot of blood.</i>

1:12:30.145 --> 1:12:33.546
<i>- Wait a minute, I think that's hair.</i>
- Okay.

1:12:34.883 --> 1:12:37.078
<i>Oh, Jesus, this is nasty.</i>

1:12:38.954 --> 1:12:40.819
<i>Oh, God. This is sticky.</i>

1:12:42.491 --> 1:12:45.949
Ronnie, the camera's sliding.
Ronnie. Shit.

1:12:49.198 --> 1:12:50.961
<i>Well, that was close.</i>

1:12:52.401 --> 1:12:53.390
Good save.

1:12:53.502 --> 1:12:56.369
<i>Okay, I got it. Jesus. How am I looking?</i>

1:12:58.774 --> 1:13:00.105
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1:13:00.676 --> 1:13:02.007
<i>What the...</i>

1:13:04.713 --> 1:13:07.204
Ronnie? Did you just close the door?

1:13:08.951 --> 1:13:11.511
<i>I think there's someone in the garage.</i>

1:13:11.787 --> 1:13:12.947
<i>Help me.</i>

1:13:16.258 --> 1:13:17.555
Ronnie.

1:13:20.796 --> 1:13:22.889
Oh, shit, he's in the house.

1:13:32.174 --> 1:13:33.505
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1:13:34.176 --> 1:13:35.336
Ronnie?

1:13:44.453 --> 1:13:45.681
Oh, shit.

1:14:05.674 --> 1:14:07.073
Ronnie!

1:14:09.511 --> 1:14:10.842
Ronnie!

1:14:13.382 --> 1:14:14.849
Open the door!

1:14:44.313 --> 1:14:45.280
Officer! Officer!

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:47.177
- Listen, my friend, has been kidnapped!
- Drop the bat now!

1:14:47.282 --> 1:14:48.772
- Down on the ground!
- Okay. Okay.

1:14:48.884 --> 1:14:50.977
Drop it. Now! Clear the bat.

1:14:51.386 --> 1:14:53.286
The only reason I came here
is my friend is in the house.

1:14:53.388 --> 1:14:56.789
He's kidnapped by the owner
of the house who's trying to kill him.

1:14:56.892 --> 1:14:58.860
- No, come on, man!
- He's claiming a possible 10-31.

1:14:58.961 --> 1:15:00.656
- It's open.
- It was open when I got here!

1:15:00.762 --> 1:15:02.753
- Breaking and entering.
- Bullshit!

1:15:03.865 --> 1:15:06.095
- Mr. Turner?
- Yes, I am. Can I help you?

1:15:06.201 --> 1:15:07.793
Sorry to wake you, sir,

1:15:07.903 --> 1:15:10.804
but the kid here is claiming
that his friend is in your house.

1:15:10.973 --> 1:15:13.441
Do you know anything about that?

1:15:14.309 --> 1:15:15.333
No, I certainly don't.

1:15:15.444 --> 1:15:16.775
You lying son of a bitch, he's in your...

1:15:16.878 --> 1:15:18.106
- That's it, come on.
- He's in the house.

1:15:18.213 --> 1:15:19.578
- Come on, here we go.
- Okay, look.

1:15:19.681 --> 1:15:20.807
He didn't just wake up five minutes ago.

1:15:20.916 --> 1:15:22.747
The man has been kidnapping
and killing people.

1:15:22.851 --> 1:15:26.309
Okay? There's a body in a blue bag
in his garage!

1:15:27.189 --> 1:15:28.349
Please.

1:15:29.491 --> 1:15:32.187
Sir, when we got here,
the door was open.

1:15:32.561 --> 1:15:34.654
Well, how would he get the door open?

1:15:34.763 --> 1:15:36.890
I'm not sure, sir. I don't see any signs
of breaking and entering.

1:15:36.999 --> 1:15:39.024
Just keep him here for a second.

1:15:39.134 --> 1:15:42.570
Yeah, he lives with his mother.
They live back here.

1:15:42.671 --> 1:15:44.901
Just give me a second, sir.

1:15:45.007 --> 1:15:48.067
Something doesn't feel right. Let's just
check it out. Just take a second.

1:15:48.543 --> 1:15:50.636
Come on, let's go.

1:15:54.249 --> 1:15:56.717
Sir, do you mind
if we take a look inside?

1:15:56.818 --> 1:15:58.547
Not at all. You be my guest.

1:15:58.653 --> 1:16:00.245
- He was stealing?
- Yeah, I think so.

1:16:00.355 --> 1:16:02.482
I'm not quite sure, but he did something.

1:16:46.935 --> 1:16:47.993
Okay.

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:03.051
I hit it the other night.

1:17:04.252 --> 1:17:08.052
I thought I could save a few steps
and get it off the road myself.

1:17:08.490 --> 1:17:11.857
I was hoping to bury it sooner,
but it's been a hell of a week.

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:13.985
But you found time to fix your fender,
though, right?

1:17:14.096 --> 1:17:15.961
Well, that car is a classic.

1:17:16.064 --> 1:17:17.691
I had to get it out of storage
for the auto show.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.892
I needed it in pristine condition.

1:17:20.001 --> 1:17:21.332
- The auto show?
- That's right.

1:17:21.436 --> 1:17:23.404
The auto show. Big car fan, huh?

1:17:23.505 --> 1:17:25.268
- All right, that's it.
- The auto show.

1:17:25.373 --> 1:17:26.601
Let's go.

1:17:26.741 --> 1:17:28.538
- What about my friend then, huh?
- All right, all right.

1:17:28.643 --> 1:17:31.043
- Where's my friend then, huh?
- Let's go. Come on.

1:17:31.146 --> 1:17:32.443
Auto show!

1:17:34.516 --> 1:17:38.418
It was his second violation, Mrs. Brecht.
He's due in court at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:39.817
Can he press charges?

1:17:39.921 --> 1:17:41.980
Well, your son was in his house,
Mrs. Brecht,

1:17:42.090 --> 1:17:45.685
and so, yes, Mr. Turner
can file charges if he chooses.

1:17:45.961 --> 1:17:48.020
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1:17:48.130 --> 1:17:49.563
Good night.

1:17:57.339 --> 1:17:58.465
I can't believe this.

1:17:58.573 --> 1:18:00.734
I can't believe you're actually buying
this guy's bullshit.

1:18:00.842 --> 1:18:02.776
- What? After what you just pulled?
- It's bullshit, Mom.

1:18:02.878 --> 1:18:04.277
And everything that's happened
this past year,

1:18:04.379 --> 1:18:07.348
it's a miracle
they didn't just take you away.

1:18:08.416 --> 1:18:11.112
- I have to go talk to him.
- What are you talking about? Now?

1:18:11.219 --> 1:18:12.686
- He could press charges, Kale.
- Now?

1:18:12.787 --> 1:18:15.813
- I don't care if he's gonna press...
- Sit down!

1:18:16.858 --> 1:18:18.018
I care.

1:18:21.763 --> 1:18:24.061
You are breaking my heart, Kale.

1:18:50.058 --> 1:18:52.549
Oh, shit.
What the hell are you doing, Ma?

1:18:52.661 --> 1:18:53.889
Oh, shit.

1:19:00.802 --> 1:19:03.066
Ronnie? Ronnie.

1:19:07.342 --> 1:19:08.639
Oh, no.

1:19:17.419 --> 1:19:18.784
Piece of shit.

1:19:49.017 --> 1:19:50.177
Ronnie.

1:19:56.725 --> 1:19:58.056
- Yo, don't kill me.
- You motherfuck.

1:19:58.159 --> 1:19:59.956
- Don't kill me. Hey...
- Are you serious?

1:20:00.061 --> 1:20:02.052
Do you have any idea
what I've just been through?

1:20:02.163 --> 1:20:03.630
Hey! Come on!

1:20:04.299 --> 1:20:06.199
I thought you were dead.

1:20:06.301 --> 1:20:08.235
Dude, did you want me to go up
to the cops and be like,

1:20:08.336 --> 1:20:11.362
"Oh, hey, you know what, Officer?
He's right. I was in his house.

1:20:11.473 --> 1:20:13.168
"I went in there to get the phone
out of the car

1:20:13.275 --> 1:20:15.038
"that I broke into earlier today."

1:20:15.143 --> 1:20:16.974
Look, all I could think of was,
"I don't want to go to jail.

1:20:17.078 --> 1:20:19.273
"Hide. Hide."
And I went into the closet, and...

1:20:19.381 --> 1:20:21.975
Okay. All right, okay, okay,
that was a bad joke.

1:20:22.083 --> 1:20:23.778
- I just wasn't thinking straight, okay?
- I get it. I get it.

1:20:23.885 --> 1:20:25.853
- Please, please. I'm so...
- Yeah.

1:20:25.954 --> 1:20:28.286
- Yeah?
- Oh, God. You bastard.

1:20:29.791 --> 1:20:32.157
God. You bastard.

1:20:32.627 --> 1:20:35.687
- Hey, so what was in the bag?
- It was a dead deer.

1:20:36.831 --> 1:20:38.856
- Naturally.
- Yeah.

1:20:40.302 --> 1:20:42.736
Yo, what is your mom doing over there?

1:20:42.837 --> 1:20:45.032
She's keeping me out of jail.

1:20:46.041 --> 1:20:48.566
Oh, wait. You know what? Then before
they confiscate this evidence,

1:20:48.677 --> 1:20:50.440
you should come over here
and peep this.

1:20:50.545 --> 1:20:53.742
I'm serious, man.
I got my whole great escape on video.

1:20:53.848 --> 1:20:57.284
I hope this works. I dropped it.
Here we are.

1:20:57.952 --> 1:20:59.715
You know what?
I was in your closet for, like, two weeks.

1:20:59.821 --> 1:21:01.379
I gotta take a piss. Check this out.

1:21:01.489 --> 1:21:03.116
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Yo, it's genius.

1:21:03.224 --> 1:21:05.454
<i>Ronnie? Did you just close the door?</i>

1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:07.528
<i>I think there's someone in the garage.</i>

1:21:08.496 --> 1:21:09.793
<i>Help me.</i>

1:21:20.375 --> 1:21:21.899
What was that?

1:21:34.756 --> 1:21:37.748
Yeah, but it's just been
really hard on him.

1:21:37.859 --> 1:21:40.191
He still blames himself.

1:21:41.496 --> 1:21:43.157
I understand.

1:21:43.264 --> 1:21:48.497
I know feelings like that, they don't...
You know, they don't just go away.

1:22:07.555 --> 1:22:11.889
Thank you so much.
You've just been so great about all this.

1:22:12.594 --> 1:22:14.687
Well, it's been my pleasure.

1:22:15.597 --> 1:22:16.859
Thanks.

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:23.935
- Good night.
- Okay.

1:22:32.213 --> 1:22:33.441
Ronnie!

1:22:35.383 --> 1:22:39.319
Ronnie, get up here! Ronnie!
She's on the tape!

1:22:40.755 --> 1:22:42.188
Ronnie!

1:22:42.857 --> 1:22:45.155
The club girl, she's dead!

1:22:45.994 --> 1:22:47.621
Ronnie!

1:24:20.021 --> 1:24:21.886
So, he got her on tape?

1:24:26.694 --> 1:24:28.685
I really didn't want this.

1:24:30.465 --> 1:24:31.830
All I wanted

1:24:33.201 --> 1:24:34.964
was to live in peace,

1:24:36.404 --> 1:24:40.738
which is why we gotta keep
the spotlight on you.

1:24:40.842 --> 1:24:43.606
You've done most of the work already.

1:24:43.711 --> 1:24:47.306
You are the troubled neighborhood boy
who cried wolf.

1:24:50.618 --> 1:24:51.812
But now,

1:24:55.089 --> 1:24:57.250
you are really going to snap.

1:25:03.164 --> 1:25:07.191
First, you killed your buddy,

1:25:07.702 --> 1:25:11.194
because he was calling your girlfriend
behind your back.

1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:16.468
And now we gotta
bring your mom over here

1:25:18.479 --> 1:25:20.811
so you can slit her throat,

1:25:21.482 --> 1:25:25.384
because she just wouldn't stop
blaming you

1:25:25.954 --> 1:25:27.785
for killing your dad.

1:25:34.696 --> 1:25:36.323
So, it sounds good?

1:25:37.899 --> 1:25:38.957
Good.

1:25:41.069 --> 1:25:42.627
Pen and paper.

1:25:49.877 --> 1:25:51.435
Write this down.

1:25:54.048 --> 1:25:55.709
"Dear Ashley,

1:25:57.685 --> 1:26:00.153
- "I killed Ronnie..."
- Kale?

1:26:03.124 --> 1:26:04.182
Kale!

1:26:05.326 --> 1:26:06.793
My God. Kale!

1:26:22.010 --> 1:26:23.136
Kale!

1:26:25.613 --> 1:26:27.581
Shut the door. Shut the door. Oh, God.

1:26:29.317 --> 1:26:31.080
Grab the phone.

1:26:32.453 --> 1:26:34.887
The scissors! Here, scissors.

1:26:46.501 --> 1:26:49.493
- Come on, 911.
- Phone is dead.

1:26:50.438 --> 1:26:52.030
Where is your mom?

1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:55.268
Turner's house. Here, take that.

1:26:58.946 --> 1:27:01.813
All right, we've gotta get across the line.

1:27:02.050 --> 1:27:03.950
Get ready to run, okay?

1:27:30.011 --> 1:27:33.378
Come on! Go! Jump!

1:27:37.251 --> 1:27:38.548
- Kale!
- Go!

1:27:40.822 --> 1:27:42.153
Come on!

1:27:53.701 --> 1:27:56.135
I've gotta get my mom.
Make sure the cops are coming, okay?

1:27:56.237 --> 1:27:57.329
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1:27:57.438 --> 1:27:58.632
- Go!
- Okay.

1:27:58.773 --> 1:27:59.740
Go!

1:28:24.599 --> 1:28:26.191
Mom!

1:28:29.270 --> 1:28:33.263
<i>13-Adam? 13-Adam-74, come in.</i>

1:28:33.374 --> 1:28:35.103
13-Adam-74. Go ahead.

1:28:35.209 --> 1:28:39.771
<i>Yeah, I realize your shift's over,</i>
<i>but that kid just hopped the fence again.</i>

1:28:39.881 --> 1:28:41.872
<i>You still want first dibs?</i>

1:28:42.483 --> 1:28:47.716
13-Adam-74.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1:28:47.955 --> 1:28:49.650
<i>Roger that. Over.</i>

1:28:51.659 --> 1:28:53.820
Yeah, when I take care of it.

1:28:57.632 --> 1:28:58.656
Mom?

1:29:17.318 --> 1:29:18.444
Mom?

1:29:54.488 --> 1:29:55.750
Mom?

1:30:07.401 --> 1:30:08.368
Mom?

1:30:20.147 --> 1:30:21.307
Shit.

1:30:22.750 --> 1:30:24.012
Oh, God.

1:30:24.418 --> 1:30:25.646
Oh, shit!

1:30:38.599 --> 1:30:39.566
Mom?

1:32:05.586 --> 1:32:07.281
It's the club girl.

1:32:09.824 --> 1:32:11.314
She never left.

1:32:27.208 --> 1:32:28.675
Mr. Turner?

1:32:30.311 --> 1:32:32.279
Sir, are you here? Police!

1:32:39.687 --> 1:32:40.847
Mom?

1:33:07.982 --> 1:33:08.949
Mom?

1:33:26.333 --> 1:33:27.300
Mom?

1:33:41.048 --> 1:33:43.039
Dispatch, 13-Adam...

1:34:35.336 --> 1:34:36.360
Mom?

1:34:40.274 --> 1:34:41.400
Hello?

1:34:47.114 --> 1:34:49.674
Mom? Mom?

1:35:07.601 --> 1:35:09.228
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1:35:09.370 --> 1:35:10.462
Oh, God.

1:35:11.839 --> 1:35:13.830
You're okay, you're okay.

1:35:18.312 --> 1:35:19.870
Here, I got you.

1:35:36.063 --> 1:35:37.792
You made me do this.

1:36:48.168 --> 1:36:49.499
You know,

1:36:50.137 --> 1:36:51.934
I think you're the first one to ever get

1:36:52.039 --> 1:36:55.475
one of these things taken off early
for good behavior.

1:36:56.143 --> 1:36:58.077
- Good behavior?
- That's what I'm calling it.

1:36:58.178 --> 1:37:00.806
You got a problem with it,
call somebody who cares.

1:37:00.914 --> 1:37:02.381
Good behavior.

1:37:03.851 --> 1:37:06.649
You all set to pay the incarceration fee,
Mrs. Brecht?

1:37:07.888 --> 1:37:09.355
You're kidding.

1:37:09.456 --> 1:37:11.219
No, she's not kidding.

1:37:11.325 --> 1:37:12.758
Today counts.

1:37:13.427 --> 1:37:14.587
She's not kidding.

1:37:14.695 --> 1:37:15.923
No. Look.

1:37:16.297 --> 1:37:17.594
Follow me.

1:37:34.748 --> 1:37:37.376
So much for being spatially challenged.

1:37:37.484 --> 1:37:39.076
Does it scare you?

1:37:39.186 --> 1:37:41.177
Oh, yes. It terrifies me.

1:37:53.233 --> 1:37:54.962
So, what happens now?

1:37:57.137 --> 1:37:58.161
- Did you see that?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1:37:58.272 --> 1:38:01.070
Mrs. Greenwood, hi. This is Joe Smith
from the satellite company.

1:38:01.175 --> 1:38:04.474
Well, we're just calling to check up
on our adult programming subscribers.

1:38:04.578 --> 1:38:06.842
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Skin flicks, ma'am.

1:38:06.947 --> 1:38:09.245
- That's what the kids are calling 'em.
<i>- Excuse me? What?</i>

1:38:09.350 --> 1:38:13.184
Well, we see that you're currently
accessing it, ma'am, as we speak.

1:38:13.287 --> 1:38:15.448
From receiver 3,
second floor of your house.

1:38:15.556 --> 1:38:17.387
<i>- But that's not possible.</i>
- I'm just doing my job.

1:38:17.491 --> 1:38:18.458
- Okay.
<i>- Thanks for your call.</i>

1:38:18.559 --> 1:38:20.026
Yes, ma'am.

1:38:21.595 --> 1:38:24.860
What are you watching?
What do you think you're doing?

1:38:25.032 --> 1:38:26.021
Nice.

1:38:27.267 --> 1:38:28.962
And I am calling your mother!

1:38:29.603 --> 1:38:31.696
- You feel better now?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1:38:31.805 --> 1:38:33.773
- But that's just the first strike, though.
- Really?

1:38:33.874 --> 1:38:36.775
Well, yeah, it's an ongoing offensive
against neighborhood evil.

1:38:36.877 --> 1:38:38.105
I'm very dedicated.

1:38:38.212 --> 1:38:39.702
You're my hero.

1:38:57.898 --> 1:39:01.197
Soon to be the most popular video
on YouTube.
