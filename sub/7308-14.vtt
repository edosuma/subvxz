WEBVTT

00:22.023 --> 00:24.943
What an adorable child, Yoon.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.778
She's like a little doll.

00:26.945 --> 00:29.489
How come l have never met
this little munchkin before?

00:29.656 --> 00:33.410
She usually stays with the sitter
while we go shopping.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.662
She's such a cutie.

00:35.829 --> 00:38.873
Well, we're running a little late today,
so if you'll excuse us.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.959
Oh, here, let me help you, dear.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.336
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

00:47.841 --> 00:49.050
l doubt they'll hear us.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.386
They've been playing
that Chinese stuff all morning.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.680
Actually, it's Korean.

00:53.847 --> 00:55.348
Oh, right, sorry.

00:55.515 --> 00:59.686
You know, Sun usually leaves
the back door open. Come on.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.862
My aunt burned down
her house like this.

01:09.029 --> 01:11.364
She really should be more careful.

01:18.913 --> 01:22.751
Oh, now that's better.
l'm not usually one to complain.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.609
l don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?

02:21.986 --> 02:23.779
A seminar on the basics
of communication

02:23.946 --> 02:26.574
- and understanding in the workplace.
- l know what sensitivity is.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.952
l'm asking why we have to spend
the whole afternoon studying it.

02:30.119 --> 02:31.287
Professional development?

02:31.453 --> 02:34.790
lf it were survival training,
advanced demolitions, perhaps--

02:34.957 --> 02:37.459
l don't think that Sympathetic
Seminars, lnc. offers those classes

02:37.626 --> 02:40.879
Skilled investigators should already be
well-versed in the subtleties

02:41.046 --> 02:44.049
- of inter-human communication.
- l like ltalian women.

02:44.216 --> 02:47.928
You're ltalian, right?
l like lrish women, too.

02:48.679 --> 02:50.848
- l stand corrected.
- You two better hurry up.

02:51.015 --> 02:53.684
- You don't wanna miss out on the fun.
- Where are you going?

02:53.851 --> 02:55.561
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.

02:55.728 --> 02:59.273
You do understand the meaning
of the word ''mandatory,'' don't you?

03:00.941 --> 03:04.570
l have been ordered to inspect
the secure-file room, probie.

03:04.737 --> 03:07.823
Sadly, that conflicts
with your exciting seminar today.

03:07.990 --> 03:10.367
No, it doesn't.
This order is for next Wednesday.

03:11.535 --> 03:13.329
- What?
- Look on the bright side, Tony.

03:13.495 --> 03:15.331
lt should only take
about five to seven hours.

03:15.539 --> 03:18.751
There's gotta be some way out of this.
Maybe l could injure myself.

03:19.376 --> 03:21.795
- What? l was only trying to help.
- l was only kidding.

03:22.838 --> 03:24.548
Sensitivity training
is gonna have to wait.

03:24.715 --> 03:26.258
We got a double homicide
at Quantico.

03:26.425 --> 03:28.177
Marine wives. Grab your gear.

03:28.385 --> 03:30.179
Yes.

03:30.346 --> 03:31.805
- lnappropriate?
- A bit.

03:32.014 --> 03:34.516
You're probably the reason
we have to take these classes.

03:34.683 --> 03:36.852
- Today.
- On your six, boss.

03:41.273 --> 03:43.359
You know, this kind of reminds me
of my cousin's house,

03:43.651 --> 03:45.027
minus all the blood.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.822
Unless you count
that Thanksgiving back in '98.

03:48.989 --> 03:51.784
Family does have a way
of fraying one's nerves.

03:51.951 --> 03:53.285
Take my mother, for instance.

03:53.452 --> 03:57.373
<i>She insists on watching Jeopardy
every night on the television.</i>

03:57.539 --> 03:59.124
What's wrong with that, Duck?

03:59.291 --> 04:01.293
The same episode,
over and over again.

04:01.502 --> 04:04.129
l made the mistake of taping it
for her once.

04:04.338 --> 04:07.174
l always say, you can pick your nose,
but you can't pick your family.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.136
There's a touch of the poet in you,
Mr. Palmer.

04:11.303 --> 04:13.430
l'd say you're just more touched.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.558
DiNozzo.

04:15.724 --> 04:17.601
House belongs to
a Sergeant Malcolm Porter

04:17.767 --> 04:20.813
and his wife, Sun, boss.
She's the one on the left.

04:20.980 --> 04:23.399
Sergeant's still on liberty
trying to track him down.

04:23.566 --> 04:25.025
The other vic is Min Crane.

04:25.234 --> 04:27.194
She's married
to a Sergeant Floyd Crane,

04:27.361 --> 04:30.406
currently deployed in lraq.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.962
Sign of an unhappy marriage.

04:45.170 --> 04:48.090
Funny, l thought it looked like
a hole in the wall.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.926
lt's about fist size.

04:51.093 --> 04:53.762
Husband probably hit the wall
instead of hitting his wife.

04:55.055 --> 04:57.850
- What else do you see?
- Judging by the position of the body

04:58.017 --> 05:00.978
- l'd say they were taken by surprise.
- Yeah? Why?

05:01.186 --> 05:03.272
Body posture. They're too relaxed.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.107
They didn't fight back.

05:05.274 --> 05:07.776
That could also mean
they knew the identity of their attacker.

05:07.943 --> 05:09.403
Search the rest of the house.

05:12.907 --> 05:16.410
Little girl's becoming quite the crime
scene investigator, isn't she, boss?

05:17.870 --> 05:20.623
l'll go help McGee
talk to the women who found them.

05:20.789 --> 05:23.375
- You got a TOD yet, Duck?
- Very recent.

05:23.542 --> 05:27.129
Both liver probes indicate
about two and a half hours ago.

05:28.213 --> 05:30.341
Triple tap, all in the heart.

05:30.507 --> 05:35.137
Yeah, but notice these burn marks
around the entry wounds

05:35.346 --> 05:37.556
here and on this one.

05:37.932 --> 05:41.644
So both of those, the weapon
was in direct contact with the body

05:41.810 --> 05:44.647
- when fired.
- Two from across the room.

05:45.814 --> 05:47.900
Then one each up close,
just to be sure.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.568
l don't believe the term ''overkill''

05:49.777 --> 05:52.112
would be inappropriate,
under these circumstances.

05:54.198 --> 05:57.493
- Bullets didn't penetrate.
- Maybe they were small-calibre.

05:57.701 --> 05:59.203
Did you find any casings?

06:00.371 --> 06:01.997
The shooter policed his brass, Duck.

06:05.251 --> 06:06.293
Policed, sir?

06:07.211 --> 06:11.257
Yes, it's military terminology
for cleaning up after one's self.

06:11.465 --> 06:13.884
We may be dealing
with a professional.

06:14.051 --> 06:17.137
- Professional what?
- Killer, Mr. Palmer.

06:18.305 --> 06:21.850
These poor women
weren't so much murdered

06:22.142 --> 06:23.602
as executed.

06:30.359 --> 06:33.487
She just needs her bottle.
l know l packed it.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.574
Look, look, look. Your mom's
right there. She's right there.

06:37.992 --> 06:40.035
Did you ever hold
a baby before, McGee?

06:40.911 --> 06:43.330
- No.
- l didn't think so.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.090
Boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.

06:53.257 --> 06:55.718
She found the body along
with the next-door neighbours.

06:55.926 --> 06:59.305
We were going into Koreatown,
shopping.

06:59.513 --> 07:01.098
l'm the only one with a car.

07:01.307 --> 07:04.268
Sun asked me
to come pick them up.

07:04.476 --> 07:06.687
lf we'd been on time--

07:07.146 --> 07:08.898
You need some help?

07:14.570 --> 07:17.364
Any idea where Sun's husband is,
Mrs. Dawson?

07:17.573 --> 07:21.285
No, he's never here
when we come over.

07:21.827 --> 07:24.079
l don't think he likes Sun
having friends.

07:24.288 --> 07:26.248
What makes you think that?

07:26.457 --> 07:28.459
He's very controlling.

07:29.335 --> 07:32.546
- Sergeant Porter abused her?
- Sun wouldn't admit it.

07:32.755 --> 07:34.673
But we suspected.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.717
He drinks.

07:37.259 --> 07:39.178
Says mean things to her.

07:39.386 --> 07:41.096
Wouldn't let her speak Korean
in the house.

07:41.305 --> 07:43.557
We tried to reason with her but--

07:43.807 --> 07:46.018
- She wouldn't leave him?
- She was ashamed.

07:46.227 --> 07:49.063
lt's hard for a Korean woman
to ask for help.

07:51.023 --> 07:53.400
- Find Porter.
- l'd start at the ''E'' Club.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.569
- James.
- l'm Yoon's husband.

07:55.778 --> 07:57.363
Listen, if you don't find Porter there,

07:57.529 --> 08:00.532
you might wanna check some
of the bars outside the front gate.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.201
l'm on it, boss.

08:02.868 --> 08:04.703
Everything's gonna be okay now,
honey, okay?

08:04.912 --> 08:06.413
Gibbs. A word, please?

08:06.622 --> 08:08.874
l just talked to her a few hours ago.

08:13.796 --> 08:15.839
Gun safe.
l found it in the master bedroom.

08:16.048 --> 08:18.592
Open and empty
except for a handful of shells.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.386
.40 calibre.

08:20.553 --> 08:23.180
Thinking maybe
the husband did this, yes?

08:25.432 --> 08:28.644
l guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo,
would be ''bastard.''

08:28.852 --> 08:31.272
He was always borrowing
my husband's tools

08:31.438 --> 08:34.232
and never returning them.
l should've known this would happen.

08:34.607 --> 08:37.611
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite
for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.

08:38.070 --> 08:40.780
All l'm saying is the two of them
had one hell of a marriage.

08:40.990 --> 08:44.034
You wouldn't know it to look at her,
but Sun's got a set of lungs.

08:44.201 --> 08:45.327
Or at least she did.

08:46.328 --> 08:48.581
- So they fought a lot?
- Oh, hardly a night went by

08:48.747 --> 08:51.709
you didn't hear all sorts of screaming
coming from this house.

08:51.917 --> 08:54.962
- You ever think to make a complaint?
- l don't like to stick my nose in.

08:55.129 --> 08:57.715
Good thing, too. lt could have been me
that got slaughtered.

08:57.882 --> 08:58.966
On our way, McGee.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.969
Sergeant Porter was spotted
30 minutes ago at the "E'' Club.

09:02.136 --> 09:04.930
- McGee's almost there.
- Thanks.

09:05.097 --> 09:07.433
Probie's not gonna make a move
on his own, is he, boss?

09:07.975 --> 09:09.643
McGee can take care of himself,
DiNozzo.

09:12.104 --> 09:13.856
You're on the hump.

09:25.034 --> 09:27.369
- He's gone.
- Nice job, probie.

09:27.578 --> 09:30.080
The bartender turned around,
Sgt. Porter wasn't there anymore.

09:30.247 --> 09:32.791
- You let him get past you?
- lt was before l got here, Tony.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.543
What's Sergeant Porter driving?

09:35.961 --> 09:40.507
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A black 2004 Ford F-1 50, boss.

09:43.385 --> 09:45.387
Hey, come on.

09:59.526 --> 10:01.111
Boss, we got a weapon
in the front seat.

10:04.114 --> 10:05.991
l think he's dead, boss.

10:16.252 --> 10:18.963
NClS. Don't move.
Get your hands on the wheel.

10:19.171 --> 10:20.965
l wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not DUl

10:21.173 --> 10:23.175
if l don't have the key
in the ignition, look.

10:23.342 --> 10:25.970
- What's he talking about?
- l think he thinks we're busting him

10:26.136 --> 10:28.097
- for driving drunk.
- Well, you're not?

10:29.557 --> 10:30.641
No.

10:30.808 --> 10:32.643
- lt's for double homicide.
- McGee.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.603
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

10:36.355 --> 10:37.773
l knew he was alive.

10:40.025 --> 10:41.860
Precision, Mr. Palmer.

10:42.027 --> 10:45.072
lt's what separates the professional
from the dilettante.

10:45.698 --> 10:47.575
Thank you, doctor.

10:47.950 --> 10:49.493
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.

10:50.369 --> 10:52.246
But not too little either.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.748
All right, come on,
come on, come on.

10:55.749 --> 10:58.294
Let's see. Yes, very good.

10:58.502 --> 11:00.921
Not bad. Not bad at all.

11:01.964 --> 11:04.758
Keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.636
You never know
which element of the enigma,

11:07.803 --> 11:12.391
however minuscule,
can lead you to the solution.

11:12.558 --> 11:15.561
Palmer just got some of your elements
on his plastic thing.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.982
- Occupational hazard, l'm afraid.
- What can you tell me, Duck?

11:20.149 --> 11:22.776
Both women were shot
three times in the chest.

11:22.985 --> 11:27.448
lt's hard to say which of these six
was the fatal wound.

11:27.615 --> 11:30.576
Suffice to say,
neither woman died of old age.

11:30.743 --> 11:33.078
- Anything else?
- Yes. Mrs. Porter

11:33.787 --> 11:37.333
has some swelling and fissures
on her fingers and knuckles.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.710
- Defensive wounds.
- Possibly.

11:39.877 --> 11:42.421
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.

11:42.588 --> 11:44.882
There are also bruises on her wrists.

11:45.049 --> 11:48.135
l'd say they were at least a week old.

11:48.802 --> 11:50.054
She was abused?

11:50.804 --> 11:52.223
Yeah.

11:55.100 --> 11:58.145
- Thanks, Duck.
- You have the man in custody now?

11:58.312 --> 11:59.563
Yeah.

11:59.730 --> 12:02.816
There's no need
to be gentle with him, Jethro.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.905
You missed a spot.

12:10.282 --> 12:12.952
We're looking at
a Beretta Cougar 8040, Gibbs.

12:13.118 --> 12:15.496
lt was registered
to Sergeant Porter in 2003

12:15.663 --> 12:17.873
- and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
- Bullets?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.751
Cross-point .40 calibre
Smith and Wesson.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.212
Also called a "Short and Wimpy,''
although l do not know why.

12:23.379 --> 12:25.464
They lack the power
of a 1 0-millimeter auto-load.

12:25.631 --> 12:28.133
You don't need that stopping power
when you gun down housewives.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.303
- What about gunshot residue?
- lnstant Shooter Kit came negative

12:31.470 --> 12:33.764
- on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
- Could've worn gloves--

12:33.931 --> 12:35.975
Or he could've changed clothes.
l'm way ahead of you.

12:36.141 --> 12:39.270
That's why l'm doing a full analysis
on all of Porter's wardrobe.

12:39.436 --> 12:41.564
''How long, Abby?''
Well, it's gonna take some time.

12:41.730 --> 12:43.482
And since this stuff
doesn't smell very good

12:43.649 --> 12:45.484
l don't think laundry was a priority.
''Abs.''

12:45.651 --> 12:48.279
Two hours. Whenever l know
something, you'll know something.

12:48.445 --> 12:50.823
''You got one. Anything else?''
Yes, as a matter of fact.

12:50.990 --> 12:53.409
This is for you.

12:54.868 --> 12:56.161
- Why?
- For getting me out

12:56.328 --> 12:57.621
of sensitivity training.

12:57.788 --> 13:00.457
We were about to do trust falls
and those guys in administration

13:00.624 --> 13:02.042
have wandering hands.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.545
''Just give me their names, Abs,
and l'll break them for you.''

13:04.712 --> 13:07.464
l know you will, Gibbs.
And that is why l love you.

13:18.559 --> 13:20.686
Boss, l'm sorry. l didn't see you.

13:20.853 --> 13:22.646
What did l say
about apologising, McGee?

13:23.647 --> 13:25.107
Sign of weakness.

13:25.316 --> 13:26.901
So is barfing on your tie.

13:27.401 --> 13:30.112
This isn't mine.

13:30.696 --> 13:32.990
We've got Sergeant Porter
in interrogation.

13:33.157 --> 13:35.576
l actually managed
to dodge most of it.

13:35.743 --> 13:38.913
Good news is
that he is sober enough to talk now.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.956
l got some on you, here,
let me get this.

13:41.123 --> 13:42.374
- Don't.
- Sorry.

13:42.541 --> 13:44.251
l mean, it won't happen again.

13:44.418 --> 13:46.879
- Who's watching him?
- Tony and Ziva.

13:47.046 --> 13:48.756
l was actually just gonna go
change my shirt.

13:48.923 --> 13:51.508
No, you won't. You're gonna follow up
on other leads.

13:51.884 --> 13:54.470
We found Sergeant Porter with the
murder weapon. What other leads?

13:54.637 --> 13:57.389
A good investigator
doesn't sit back and wait.

13:57.556 --> 13:59.808
You run down every angle,
every lead.

13:59.975 --> 14:02.770
Assume everything you've been told
is a lie until it checks out.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.563
Got it.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.815
There's only one time
l want you to stop, McGee.

14:07.650 --> 14:11.237
- When you tell me.
- When you're satisfied.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.114
When you're satisfied.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.618
Okay.

14:18.661 --> 14:20.454
- Hey!
- Yeah?

14:20.621 --> 14:22.581
Get me another cup of coffee.

14:27.294 --> 14:30.089
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs will rip this guy apart.

14:30.673 --> 14:32.925
l don't know if that's the right tactic
in this case, Tony.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.386
What, are you an expert
on suspect interviews, now?

14:35.553 --> 14:38.973
lnterviews, no.
lnterrogation techniques, yes.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.475
Like hooking a car battery
up to a guy's privates?

14:41.642 --> 14:45.062
l'm sure it's effective,
but judges tend to frown on it.

14:45.229 --> 14:47.773
l've learned from Gibbs
that in certain cases

14:47.940 --> 14:50.276
you can attract
far more bees with honey.

14:50.442 --> 14:51.777
Flies.

14:51.944 --> 14:57.491
- What do flies have to do with honey?
- Flies don't like vinegar.

14:58.617 --> 15:00.035
Vinegar?

15:00.202 --> 15:02.454
lt's complicated. Here he comes.

15:05.624 --> 15:07.251
Here you go.

15:07.543 --> 15:08.878
There.

15:09.837 --> 15:12.089
You look like you could use it.

15:18.721 --> 15:20.681
My wife's really dead, sir?

15:23.350 --> 15:24.518
How?

15:24.685 --> 15:26.854
Drink your coffee, sergeant.

15:27.396 --> 15:30.524
When you're ready
we'll work our way up to it.

15:30.691 --> 15:32.276
What's he doing?

15:33.152 --> 15:35.654
Where's his strong-arming?
The intimidation?

15:35.821 --> 15:37.948
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?

15:39.325 --> 15:40.409
<i>Bad marriage, huh?</i>

15:43.203 --> 15:45.080
lt's okay.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.666
l've had a few myself.

15:47.833 --> 15:49.793
lt wasn't perfect,

15:49.960 --> 15:51.587
but l loved her, sir.

15:51.754 --> 15:53.672
Problem was...

15:54.173 --> 15:56.175
l don't think--

15:57.635 --> 15:59.803
l don't think she ever loved me.

16:01.013 --> 16:03.015
l'll bet she loved that paycheque,
though, right?

16:03.682 --> 16:04.975
Yeah.

16:05.142 --> 16:06.977
l should have known it.

16:07.228 --> 16:09.063
Just look at me.

16:09.605 --> 16:11.565
She was way out of my league,
you know?

16:11.732 --> 16:13.859
She just married me
to get to the States.

16:14.818 --> 16:16.362
lt happens.

16:16.528 --> 16:18.280
Thing is...

16:18.447 --> 16:21.700
l guess l always thought she
might change her mind, you know?

16:22.993 --> 16:25.829
Then she started
sneaking out to the "O'' Club,

16:26.372 --> 16:28.082
hanging out with officers.

16:28.249 --> 16:30.501
l've seen it before.

16:32.503 --> 16:35.047
She thought she could trade up.

16:35.214 --> 16:37.132
She didn't want me.

16:37.299 --> 16:39.134
No matter what l did.

16:39.301 --> 16:41.512
lt just got to the point--

16:42.805 --> 16:44.723
l just wanted her to disappear.

16:44.890 --> 16:47.142
Yeah, when you get pushed,
you want to push back.

16:49.186 --> 16:51.021
That why you decide
to blow her away?

16:53.399 --> 16:55.067
Excuse me, sir?

16:55.234 --> 16:59.363
ls that the reason you shot Min Crane
and your wife to death today?

17:01.073 --> 17:02.575
Okay, here we go.

17:02.741 --> 17:03.826
He hasn't confessed yet.

17:03.993 --> 17:05.578
- He will.
- Maybe.

17:06.036 --> 17:08.539
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How about nothing?

17:08.705 --> 17:10.457
- Twenty bucks?
- Deal.

17:10.665 --> 17:13.419
l'm telling you
l didn't kill them, sir.

17:13.586 --> 17:16.088
The murder weapon
was in your truck, sergeant.

17:16.255 --> 17:17.923
Someone must have put it there.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.633
Your fingerprints are all over it.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.094
l didn't shoot my wife, sir.

17:22.261 --> 17:24.262
Did you use your fists
on her, sergeant?

17:24.430 --> 17:26.223
Knock her around a little bit,
or maybe

17:26.390 --> 17:28.267
or maybe
that just wasn't cutting it anymore.

17:28.434 --> 17:31.395
l never laid a hand on Sun.

17:33.147 --> 17:35.566
<i>Your neighbour heard the fights,
sergeant.</i>

17:35.733 --> 17:36.942
l saw the hole you punched.

17:37.109 --> 17:39.778
l only punched the hole in the wall
so l wouldn't hit her, sir.

17:39.945 --> 17:41.614
Her hands were all bruised
and cut

17:41.780 --> 17:43.782
from where she fought you off
all the time.

17:43.949 --> 17:45.618
- That's not how it happened.
- Really?

17:45.784 --> 17:47.620
How did l get it wrong?
How'd it happen?

17:47.786 --> 17:49.330
She was the--

17:50.623 --> 17:52.791
She the one who was abusing me.

17:54.793 --> 17:56.587
You don't believe me?

17:57.087 --> 17:59.215
Take a look at this.

18:02.801 --> 18:04.595
Sit down.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.974
Sun was violent, sir.

18:09.141 --> 18:13.103
She hit me. She called me names.
She threw things.

18:13.270 --> 18:15.272
l tried to hold her off

18:15.439 --> 18:19.610
but l never--
l never once laid a hand on her.

18:20.736 --> 18:23.364
l just wanted it to stop.

18:24.406 --> 18:26.075
- Pay up.
- He didn't confess.

18:26.283 --> 18:28.327
- lt was damn close.
- Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.

18:28.494 --> 18:29.662
Well, we got enough evidence

18:29.828 --> 18:32.831
even if you didn't break him
in interrogation, boss.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.669
Not to say that
you couldn't have broken him

18:36.835 --> 18:38.921
if you wanted to.
l really like that shirt.

18:40.339 --> 18:43.717
Tony's right. we have Sgt. Porter's gun
with his fingerprints in his car.

18:43.884 --> 18:46.720
He blows away his wife and her friend
in a rage. Gets drunk. Passes out

18:46.887 --> 18:49.682
- before he can commit suicide.
- Why did he police his brass?

18:49.848 --> 18:52.351
- Habit of a well-trained Marine.
- He worked the motor pool.

18:52.810 --> 18:55.187
According to his records,
he failed to qualify twice

18:55.354 --> 18:57.356
on the pistol range last year.

18:58.023 --> 19:00.442
Abby get the results of the GSR tests
on his clothing yet?

19:00.651 --> 19:02.528
- All negative, boss.
- He could have worn gloves

19:02.695 --> 19:05.364
- or got rid of the clothes he's wearing.
- But he leaves his pistol

19:05.531 --> 19:06.824
in full view on the front seat.

19:06.991 --> 19:08.492
Boss, l think l've got something here.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.661
l just spoke with the director
of the Officers' Club.

19:10.828 --> 19:12.871
Apparently Sun Porter
was a regular fixture there.

19:13.038 --> 19:16.375
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.

19:17.126 --> 19:19.461
- For what, McGee?
- One of their husbands showed up,

19:19.628 --> 19:21.380
made a scene, had to be carried out.

19:21.547 --> 19:23.424
Another nail
in Sergeant Porter's coffin.

19:23.591 --> 19:25.718
lt wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.

19:28.345 --> 19:32.057
Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.

19:35.561 --> 19:38.689
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at
the "E'' Club with the murder weapon.

19:39.857 --> 19:42.318
l knew they were having troubles,
but never expected this.

19:42.776 --> 19:44.194
Where's your wife,
Sergeant Dawson?

19:44.361 --> 19:47.448
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why? ls something wrong, sir?

19:48.073 --> 19:50.242
What happened at the Officer's Club
last month?

19:51.869 --> 19:53.203
Let me refresh your memory.

19:53.370 --> 19:55.289
You had an altercation
with two Marine captains.

19:55.456 --> 19:57.708
Yeah, it was nothing.
lt was just a misunderstanding.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.377
Big enough for a Letter of Reprimand
in your SRB.

20:00.544 --> 20:02.838
Maybe we should ask your wife
about it, sergeant?

20:03.005 --> 20:05.299
- She had a rough day. l'd rather not--
- Down the hall?

20:05.466 --> 20:07.009
Yeah, but l'd rather not disturb her.

20:07.218 --> 20:10.054
- We'll see if she's still breathing.
- You think l killed Sun and Min

20:10.221 --> 20:13.140
because they had a couple of drinks
with my wife at the "O'' Club?

20:13.307 --> 20:16.352
Mrs. Dawson, NClS.
We're gonna ask you a few questions.

20:17.603 --> 20:20.272
Yoon. lt's me. Please.
Yoon, open up.

20:20.439 --> 20:23.025
- Do you have a key?
- lt's locked from the inside. Yoon.

20:23.192 --> 20:24.693
Yoon.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.622
lt's okay. lt's okay.

20:43.695 --> 20:45.197
lt doesn't make sense, sir.

20:45.364 --> 20:47.366
Someone kills
my wife's two best friends,

20:47.532 --> 20:48.951
then they decide to kidnap her?

20:49.743 --> 20:51.787
When's the last time
you saw her, sergeant?

20:51.954 --> 20:53.497
About an hour
before you showed up.

20:53.872 --> 20:55.916
She was putting the baby to sleep
in our room.

20:57.042 --> 20:59.461
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

20:59.628 --> 21:01.421
Can we stop standing around
and do something?

21:01.588 --> 21:02.965
We are.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.050
We are. Sit down.

21:06.051 --> 21:07.260
And what exactly is that, sir?

21:07.427 --> 21:09.972
Figuring out if you're a suspect
or a victim.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.807
The window was broken
from the outside.

21:12.015 --> 21:14.351
Whoever did this slipped in,
grabbed her and slipped out.

21:14.518 --> 21:18.563
None of the neighbours heard
or saw anything unusual, boss.

21:18.730 --> 21:20.190
MP's are searching the area.

21:20.357 --> 21:22.276
Also checking every vehicle
leaving the base.

21:22.442 --> 21:25.320
- You think she still might be on base?
- lt's possible.

21:25.529 --> 21:27.364
We need to be out there
looking for her.

21:27.531 --> 21:29.324
lf she's still on base we'll find her.

21:29.491 --> 21:33.203
Someone put a lot of effort into taking
her away without alerting you.

21:33.370 --> 21:35.372
There's a good chance
she's not dead yet.

21:35.998 --> 21:37.499
Yet?

21:37.791 --> 21:40.836
Oh, God,
why would someone do this?

21:41.003 --> 21:42.921
For the same reason
someone killed her friends.

21:43.088 --> 21:45.007
You think l had something
to do with this?

21:45.215 --> 21:46.800
Sit down.

21:47.926 --> 21:50.220
What happened
at the Officer's Club, sergeant?

21:50.387 --> 21:52.931
lt was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.

21:53.098 --> 21:54.308
Yoon just drops them off.

21:54.474 --> 21:56.768
This one time she went in
and had a couple of drinks.

21:56.935 --> 21:59.604
She couldn't drive home
so she called me.

22:00.272 --> 22:01.315
<i>- Gibbs.
- Boss--</i>

22:01.481 --> 22:04.067
When did you get into a verbal
altercation with the Marine captains?

22:04.234 --> 22:06.320
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.

22:06.528 --> 22:08.447
They tried to stop me
from taking her home.

22:08.822 --> 22:10.949
What would you do, sir?

22:11.116 --> 22:14.369
You think one of these captains might
have had something to do with this?

22:14.536 --> 22:17.247
We're wasting our time. l'm telling you,
l had nothing to do with this.

22:17.414 --> 22:20.208
l know that.
Your alibi just checked out.

22:20.417 --> 22:22.794
The sergeant was on duty
at the time of the shootings.

22:23.629 --> 22:24.963
So what now, sir?

22:27.549 --> 22:30.552
Three Korean women met
and married Marines in Seoul

22:30.719 --> 22:33.263
at roughly the same time.
Two of them are dead.

22:33.430 --> 22:36.433
Our prime suspect was locked up here
when the third went missing.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.769
Think it's a racial thing?

22:39.144 --> 22:41.229
No. Definitely do not think
that it's a hate crime.

22:41.438 --> 22:44.358
ln my experience there's only
one colour in the Marines.

22:44.524 --> 22:47.069
What l've seen of your Marine Corps,
it's very ethnically diverse.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.279
He means green, Ziva.
And l think he's right.

22:49.488 --> 22:52.491
Well, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.

22:53.325 --> 22:55.994
Like some kind of blood feud.

22:56.203 --> 22:59.915
Competing villages, ancient oaths,
revenge from across the ocean.

23:00.123 --> 23:02.668
This is not one
of your stupid action movies, Tony.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.962
No, it isn't.
lf it was, you'd be dressed differently.

23:05.128 --> 23:07.172
And you'd be far better looking.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.342
You'd be dead
by the opening credits.

23:10.842 --> 23:13.637
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
l am the plucky comic relief?

23:13.845 --> 23:17.182
You find out what the hell happened
to Yoon Dawson yet?

23:18.350 --> 23:19.768
Plucky?

23:19.935 --> 23:23.689
- Well, Ziva and Tony and l--
- Were just working on that, boss.

23:23.897 --> 23:26.650
We're going through a list of anyone
who had access to the base

23:26.817 --> 23:28.694
in the last two days.
So far, no solid leads.

23:28.944 --> 23:31.029
What about the Marines
Sergeant Dawson fought with?

23:31.196 --> 23:33.282
Both transferred
out of Quantico last month.

23:33.448 --> 23:35.242
One at Camp Pendleton,
the other is in Okinawa.

23:35.409 --> 23:37.202
The two dead women lived
insular lives.

23:37.369 --> 23:39.871
They spent most of their time together
with other Koreans.

23:40.038 --> 23:42.833
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only
one who embraced American life.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.086
Any reason to believe that Sergeant
Porter isn't still involved in this?

23:46.295 --> 23:47.838
He could have had
an accomplice, probie.

23:48.046 --> 23:50.841
He could have had three, DiNozzo.
We need more information.

23:51.633 --> 23:54.553
Actually, boss, Abby and l,
we have been working on something.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.723
We got the women's phone records,
credit card receipts, address books.

23:57.931 --> 23:59.850
Abby is referencing to see
if there's a pattern.

24:00.058 --> 24:02.227
DiNozzo, l want to know
about anybody in the area

24:02.436 --> 24:05.105
who's made threats against Koreans,
foreign Marine wives, or women.

24:05.272 --> 24:06.523
Oh, is that all?

24:06.732 --> 24:08.775
- On it, boss.
- Find out about their lives

24:08.942 --> 24:10.193
before they married Marines.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.238
Come on, you're with me, Elf Lord.

24:14.364 --> 24:16.825
lt's amazing how much you can find
out about someone

24:16.992 --> 24:18.410
without actually meeting them.

24:18.577 --> 24:22.122
For instance, me and these women
have absolutely nothing in common.

24:22.873 --> 24:25.709
They web-browse
for cake recipes, gardening tips

24:25.876 --> 24:28.962
and Min Crane has some weird
obsession with stained glass.

24:29.129 --> 24:32.507
That's not even mentioning their
music downloads. One word: Yanni.

24:34.009 --> 24:35.427
Good point. Who cares?

24:35.636 --> 24:37.471
Their schedules
were pretty regulated.

24:37.638 --> 24:40.515
On Wednesdays and Fridays
they trekked to Koreatown.

24:40.724 --> 24:42.893
They'd shop for a couple of hours,
then they'd have tea

24:43.060 --> 24:45.062
at Lee's Neighbourhood Market.

24:45.270 --> 24:48.231
They alternated paying.
lt was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.

24:48.398 --> 24:50.317
Not exactly groundbreaking
police work there.

24:50.525 --> 24:52.736
- She's not done yet, McGee.
- Thank you, Gibbs.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.949
Within the last month, all three of them
received regular phone calls

24:57.115 --> 24:59.743
from a pay phone located just outside
Lee's Neighbourhood Market.

25:00.744 --> 25:02.996
lt is owned and operated
by Lee Sung.

25:03.205 --> 25:05.499
He sells Korean delicacies,
fruits and vegetables

25:05.707 --> 25:08.085
and those cute little anime figurines
with the funny faces.

25:08.251 --> 25:09.461
Oh, l love those.

25:10.295 --> 25:13.590
He also has a catering business,
Lee's Delights.

25:13.799 --> 25:15.801
lt's authentic Korean food.
Very high end.

25:15.968 --> 25:18.053
All three women have worked
for him as hostesses

25:18.261 --> 25:21.139
and they were scheduled to work
an event for him tomorrow afternoon.

25:21.348 --> 25:22.975
- How do you know?
- Because.

25:23.183 --> 25:25.310
Lee's Sung e-mailed them
the instructions.

25:25.519 --> 25:28.730
lt's a Korean diplomatic event
at the Pacific Rim Society.

25:28.939 --> 25:31.441
Tell me l didn't just smack McGee
for no good reason.

25:31.650 --> 25:33.735
You didn't smack McGee
for no good reason.

25:33.944 --> 25:37.489
Last night, Yoon Dawson
used her cell phone

25:37.656 --> 25:39.533
to call the pay phone
outside Lee's Market.

25:39.741 --> 25:42.411
Two hours later...she's missing.

25:42.577 --> 25:43.745
Why is this important?

25:43.954 --> 25:48.625
Because someone is still using
her cell phone to call that pay phone.

25:50.002 --> 25:52.045
- Can we get a fix on the phone?
- Negatory, McGee.

25:52.254 --> 25:55.632
l know it's somewhere in Annandale,
Virginia, but they turn it off

25:55.841 --> 25:58.885
before l can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.

25:59.094 --> 26:01.263
McGee, l want a tap
on that damn pay phone.

26:01.471 --> 26:03.682
Abby, l wanna know who answers it.

26:04.266 --> 26:05.392
That's good work, Abs.

26:07.102 --> 26:08.145
What was that for?

26:08.312 --> 26:10.147
For mocking my groundbreaking
police work.

26:10.564 --> 26:11.982
l was not mocking you--

26:13.609 --> 26:14.651
Won't happen again.

26:19.531 --> 26:21.074
Damn, l can't believe this.

26:21.533 --> 26:23.869
l don't really like waiting
here either, Tony.

26:24.077 --> 26:27.831
No, Nick and Jessica broke up.
l'm always the last to know.

26:28.582 --> 26:29.625
<i>Hey, DiNozzo.</i>

26:29.791 --> 26:31.627
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, boss.

26:37.716 --> 26:38.967
Hey, probie, you getting this?

26:39.134 --> 26:40.969
Yeah, got it, Tony.

26:46.058 --> 26:47.601
lt's Yoon Dawson's
cell phone again.

26:47.768 --> 26:49.353
l want a location, McGee.

26:51.229 --> 26:53.815
Whoever it is, they disabled
the onboard GPS chip.

26:53.982 --> 26:55.692
We'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

26:55.859 --> 26:59.613
Just take a moment to get a bead on
the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.

26:59.821 --> 27:02.199
We got someone headed
to the phone, boss.

27:06.078 --> 27:08.121
<i>- You want us to take him down now?
- Negative.</i>

27:08.330 --> 27:09.665
Wait until we trace the call.

27:12.042 --> 27:13.710
Okay, l've got
the cell phone grid located.

27:14.753 --> 27:16.672
lt's coming from this neighbourhood.

27:16.838 --> 27:18.340
Somewhere on this street.

27:18.507 --> 27:19.758
<i>You copy that, DiNozzo?</i>

27:19.967 --> 27:23.387
Well, we're scanning for targets now.
There are a lot of possibles.

27:23.553 --> 27:25.097
lf you don't respond,
l'm gonna hang up.

27:25.263 --> 27:27.182
<i>Don't, l have information for you.</i>

27:29.226 --> 27:31.770
Wool cap, head down,
heading towards the pay phone.

27:31.979 --> 27:33.313
Got him.

27:39.069 --> 27:40.153
Drop your weapon.

27:42.155 --> 27:43.657
Federal agents, move!

27:43.865 --> 27:45.617
lt's Yoon Dawson, boss.
She's rabitting.

27:45.784 --> 27:47.911
We're cutting her off, DiNozzo.

28:14.479 --> 28:16.106
l know she didn't pass us.

28:16.273 --> 28:17.649
Well, where the hell did she go?

28:17.983 --> 28:19.985
lt's like she disappeared.

28:21.987 --> 28:23.655
She didn't disappear.

28:29.411 --> 28:33.040
lt's her hat.
She climbed her way out.

28:45.969 --> 28:48.722
lf l am here, l answer the pay phone,
Agent McGee.

28:48.622 --> 28:50.624
Many people in this community
are poor.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.753
Can't afford phone service,
so l take messages for them.

28:53.919 --> 28:55.296
You see, it helps them

28:55.463 --> 28:58.424
and it is good for my business
when they come to pick up.

28:59.091 --> 29:00.926
Boss, did you find her?

29:01.093 --> 29:03.429
Yeah, McGee.
She's hiding in my coffee cup.

29:04.972 --> 29:07.141
We didn't find her.
Just give us one second, please.

29:08.559 --> 29:10.227
Has he calmed down yet?

29:10.436 --> 29:13.647
Well, he's a little shaky
but l think he's ready to talk.

29:14.273 --> 29:15.983
Min and Sun.

29:16.150 --> 29:17.860
They are dead?

29:19.904 --> 29:21.405
lt's my fault.

29:21.572 --> 29:23.449
l take responsibility.

29:23.616 --> 29:25.993
l try to help people new
to this country.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.662
Find jobs for them,
get them training, classes.

29:28.996 --> 29:30.331
Sometimes even loan money.

29:30.498 --> 29:33.125
You hired all three of them
to work for your catering company?

29:33.292 --> 29:34.794
l did.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.963
l would notice when Yoon was tired,
her accent would change.

29:38.130 --> 29:41.342
Sometimes she would use words not
common in my country since the war.

29:41.676 --> 29:44.512
Yoon-Sook Dawson
wasn't South Korean.

29:44.679 --> 29:47.973
l began to believe
that she was from the North.

29:49.767 --> 29:51.268
Perhaps a spy?

29:51.727 --> 29:53.312
Why didn't you go to the police?

29:53.479 --> 29:56.273
Well, l couldn't be sure.
What if l was wrong?

29:56.482 --> 29:59.151
l asked Min and Sun to find out
where she grew up,

29:59.360 --> 30:00.736
what schools she go to.

30:00.903 --> 30:02.530
Then l check her answers

30:02.697 --> 30:06.033
and try to locate relatives
from Korea.

30:06.534 --> 30:08.119
- Nothing.
- Who else knew

30:08.285 --> 30:12.039
- you were checking up on her?
- Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.

30:12.456 --> 30:14.041
She was trying to protect her cover?

30:14.208 --> 30:15.710
She failed.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.129
We're taking you
into protective custody, Mr. Sung.

30:18.337 --> 30:19.547
No.

30:19.714 --> 30:20.840
l will not hide.

30:21.549 --> 30:24.677
- Mr. Sung, she could come back.
- Let her.

30:24.844 --> 30:26.220
l am ready this time.

30:26.387 --> 30:28.973
l won't stop living my life
because of people like her.

30:29.140 --> 30:32.059
- Sir, l really don't think that this--
- Mr. Sung.

30:32.476 --> 30:34.020
Thank you for your help.

30:34.186 --> 30:35.938
lf you think of anything else,
give me a call.

30:36.105 --> 30:38.274
Yes, l will.
And please thank your agents for me.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.610
Boss, you're not really
gonna let him just--

30:41.777 --> 30:45.072
McGee, you know the FBl
does not exist only to piss me off.

30:45.322 --> 30:48.242
Sometimes they can actually
be useful.

30:48.784 --> 30:49.994
Hey, Fornell.

30:50.619 --> 30:53.581
l got one right up
your jurisdiction.

30:54.540 --> 30:57.376
Like my father always said,
''Be careful who you marry, Anthony.

30:57.543 --> 30:59.587
She may end up
being a homicidal maniac.''

30:59.754 --> 31:02.757
- Your father actually said that to you?
- No, but l'm sure he thought it.

31:02.923 --> 31:04.759
Probably he knew
your taste in women.

31:06.093 --> 31:08.929
Abby's got active taps
on Sergeant Dawson's cell,

31:09.096 --> 31:10.598
home and work phones, boss.

31:10.765 --> 31:12.808
- lf she calls her husband, we'll know.
- She won't.

31:13.267 --> 31:16.979
The FBl team shadowing Mr. Sung
is tied directly into MTAC.

31:17.146 --> 31:20.441
They're last report had him
loading up a catering truck for a job.

31:20.608 --> 31:22.026
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.

31:22.234 --> 31:24.570
lt's highly doubtful she'd make
another attempt on his life.

31:24.737 --> 31:27.782
We've got four agents providing
surveillance on Dawson's house.

31:27.948 --> 31:29.950
She definitely won't be
returning home.

31:30.826 --> 31:32.495
And how do you know this,
Officer David?

31:32.661 --> 31:34.580
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.

31:35.748 --> 31:37.291
Now tell us what you'd do.

31:37.500 --> 31:41.796
lf l was Yoon, everything l've done up
to this point was to protect my cover.

31:42.004 --> 31:44.215
l've dealt with the two
possible threats on base and--

31:44.382 --> 31:47.134
lf by ''dealt'' you mean gunning down
two defenceless housewives...

31:48.552 --> 31:50.971
l attempted to deal with the third,
but my cover was blown.

31:51.138 --> 31:52.973
l'm now only left
with a few possibilities.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.600
You rush back to your country?

31:54.767 --> 31:59.146
Or carry out whatever mission l was
assigned before l'm captured or killed.

31:59.313 --> 32:00.898
She's been in the States
for three years.

32:01.065 --> 32:03.192
lf you had a mission,
wouldn't you have carried it out?

32:03.567 --> 32:05.152
Not if l'm a sleeper, McGee.

32:05.653 --> 32:07.822
She could be here for decades
before being activated.

32:07.988 --> 32:10.908
So tell us, Jane Bond,
how do we track you down, huh?

32:11.117 --> 32:12.326
You don't, Tony.

32:12.493 --> 32:15.287
By now l've changed my appearance,
l've replaced my identity

32:15.454 --> 32:17.331
with backup documents
and l've relocated.

32:17.748 --> 32:18.958
Promise?

32:19.834 --> 32:23.004
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?

32:23.170 --> 32:24.880
You might think about this,
l'm gonna pay.

32:25.339 --> 32:27.341
No one's eating until we find
Yoon Dawson.

32:27.550 --> 32:29.719
lt's not that Tony couldn't stand
to lose a little weight

32:30.344 --> 32:33.014
but we'd all starve to death
before that happened.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.349
She's playing it like l would.
She's gone.

32:35.516 --> 32:37.518
There's one difference
between the two of you, Ziva.

32:37.685 --> 32:39.437
You don't have a baby girl.

32:39.645 --> 32:42.189
Most likely part of her cover
or an occupational accident.

32:42.815 --> 32:44.608
- lt's more than that.
- How can you tell?

32:45.192 --> 32:48.029
My gut. Come on.
You're with me. Let's go.

32:50.531 --> 32:53.034
Hey, probie.
Let me ask you a question.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.829
You don't think she was serious about
the whole losing a few pounds thing?

32:58.247 --> 33:00.416
Are you gonna hit me
if l tell you the truth?

33:00.708 --> 33:02.626
No, man. We're buds.

33:03.377 --> 33:04.712
Yeah.

33:12.678 --> 33:14.347
My wife is not a spy, sir.

33:14.722 --> 33:16.640
Her South Korean passport's
a forgery.

33:16.807 --> 33:18.142
lt's not possible, okay?

33:18.309 --> 33:20.519
Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than me.

33:20.728 --> 33:22.563
She was trained to,
it's called a honey trap.

33:22.730 --> 33:25.024
Her assignment was to meet
an eligible serviceman,

33:25.232 --> 33:26.901
seduce him and gain access
into this country.

33:27.068 --> 33:28.986
Oh, yeah? Then why was she
trying to convince me

33:29.153 --> 33:31.072
to leave the Marine Corps
and go to college?

33:31.238 --> 33:33.240
Most likely you were not part
of the assignment.

33:33.407 --> 33:35.409
- You were a means to an end.
- Listen. Okay,

33:35.576 --> 33:38.371
l've lived with her for five years.
She's the mother of my child.

33:38.537 --> 33:40.414
l'm telling you, there's no way.

33:44.835 --> 33:47.922
- What's this?
- Your wife.

33:52.677 --> 33:54.428
No, that can't be real.

33:54.595 --> 33:56.180
lt's real.

33:59.141 --> 34:00.810
Min Crane and Sun Porter?

34:00.976 --> 34:02.770
She killed them?

34:04.730 --> 34:07.024
- Oh, my God.
- Has she tried to contact you?

34:07.191 --> 34:09.193
- No.
- She's a foreign agent, Marine.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.237
You lie about this, it's treason.

34:11.404 --> 34:13.739
She hasn't. She hasn't tried
to contact me, sir.

34:13.906 --> 34:15.116
Okay, we think she might.

34:15.282 --> 34:18.119
lf she does and you confront her,
she will most likely kill you.

34:21.455 --> 34:23.581
l just can't believe this.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.755
Go ahead.

34:46.438 --> 34:48.149
<i>- Hello?
- lt's me, James.</i>

34:48.315 --> 34:51.485
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NClS is here.

34:51.652 --> 34:54.112
<i>- They're telling me all sorts of things.
- Don't speak.</i>

34:54.655 --> 34:55.947
Just listen to me, okay?

34:56.157 --> 34:57.783
You need to come home now.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.454
lt's too late for that.

35:01.620 --> 35:03.372
l've done things.

35:03.539 --> 35:05.332
<i>- Terrible things.
- l don't care, all right?</i>

35:05.499 --> 35:07.334
Tell me where you are
and l'll come and get you.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.295
<i>There's one more thing
that l need to do.</i>

35:09.503 --> 35:11.839
l don't have a choice.

35:12.006 --> 35:14.508
<i>- l never had a choice.
- Just tell me why.</i>

35:14.675 --> 35:17.011
<i>- Please, sweetheart.
- No matter what they say,</i>

35:17.178 --> 35:19.597
what they tell you about me,

35:19.764 --> 35:22.725
know that l loved you
with all my heart.

35:22.892 --> 35:25.353
That it was for real.

35:25.603 --> 35:27.855
And tell Rebecca--

35:28.814 --> 35:32.276
Tell her Mommy is sorry for this.
All of it.

35:32.485 --> 35:34.445
This is insane.
Yoon, you can't do--

35:34.612 --> 35:38.032
<i>l love you both so much,
more than you can imagine</i>

35:38.240 --> 35:39.992
but l can't let it happen.

35:40.201 --> 35:43.245
<i>Yoon, don't. Yoon, don't hang up.</i>

35:44.872 --> 35:47.792
l got her, Tony. She's at a pay phone
in Annandale, Virginia.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.544
The corner of Raven Road
and Lancaster Drive.

35:50.711 --> 35:53.798
- Way to go, Abs.
- Kind of a weird place to be hiding out.

35:53.964 --> 35:55.883
There's nothing there
except country clubs.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.219
Lee Sung's catering job?

35:58.386 --> 35:59.970
The Pacific Rim Society.

36:03.057 --> 36:04.225
lt's in Annandale!

36:04.392 --> 36:07.353
Either that's a coincidence or she
really, really wants to kill this guy.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.606
- l don't believe in coincidence.
- ''l don't believe in coincidence.''

36:57.653 --> 36:58.988
No. No, Yoon.

37:09.957 --> 37:12.752
Where is it, Lee Sung?

37:13.377 --> 37:16.464
Have you no honour left, woman?

37:17.089 --> 37:19.175
More than you.

37:20.134 --> 37:23.179
Scream and l kill you.

37:28.976 --> 37:31.979
Found out why the FBl
isn't responding, boss.

37:32.146 --> 37:34.106
<i>- She's definitely here.
- Keep looking, DiNozzo.</i>

37:34.273 --> 37:35.608
l'm right behind you.

37:42.031 --> 37:45.034
l will kill you
if you don't answer this time.

37:46.911 --> 37:48.412
Where?

37:50.664 --> 37:51.957
ln the truck.

37:53.876 --> 37:55.294
Drop the weapon.

37:57.046 --> 37:59.674
There's a bomb set
to go off in this building.

38:00.591 --> 38:02.551
lf you kill me now, we all die.

38:04.637 --> 38:07.390
Put your weapon down.

38:08.057 --> 38:09.558
l was a North Korean operative.

38:10.309 --> 38:12.520
We kind of figured that part out
on our own.

38:12.728 --> 38:16.023
The part that you don't know
is that my cell included Sun Porter,

38:16.190 --> 38:18.734
- Min Crane and this man.
- She's lying.

38:19.151 --> 38:23.239
l swear on the life of my daughter
that l'm trying to prevent this attack.

38:23.406 --> 38:26.367
And l swear if you don't release
your weapon, l will kill you.

38:33.624 --> 38:34.792
The bomb is in his truck.

38:35.418 --> 38:38.421
Please, we may
only have minutes left.

38:55.229 --> 38:57.398
- Now do you believe me?
- Can you disarm it?

39:02.278 --> 39:05.239
lf l had a couple of days,
maybe. You?

39:07.366 --> 39:09.076
l could try.

39:09.827 --> 39:12.621
But l suggest not standing within
five miles of here while l attempt it.

39:13.789 --> 39:15.958
- l can.
- She put it there.

39:16.125 --> 39:17.418
She's trying to kill us all.

39:18.044 --> 39:19.628
They're evacuating the building, boss.

39:19.837 --> 39:21.797
And the--

39:21.964 --> 39:24.800
- That's a really big bomb.
- You think, DiNozzo?

39:24.967 --> 39:28.304
l didn't kill them to maintain my cover,
Agent Gibbs.

39:28.471 --> 39:30.264
l did it to keep my family.

39:33.059 --> 39:35.478
- l failed.
- She's a North Korean spy.

39:35.644 --> 39:37.271
Not anymore.

39:37.813 --> 39:39.982
At least let me prevent this.

39:46.489 --> 39:47.656
McGee, get Sung out of here.

39:47.823 --> 39:49.575
- Get the cuffs off her.
- Gibbs.

39:49.742 --> 39:51.786
lt's not a debate, Officer David. Go.

39:51.952 --> 39:53.746
Go on. Get out of here.
All of you.

39:54.622 --> 39:56.540
Get a clear distance away.
l'll handle it from here.

39:56.707 --> 39:58.376
l don't care
how hard you whack me, boss.

39:58.542 --> 40:00.169
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Nor am l.

40:01.170 --> 40:03.422
lf we survive this,
you're both fired.

40:24.694 --> 40:26.028
lt's supposed to do that, right?

40:52.888 --> 40:53.931
lt's done.

40:55.224 --> 40:56.851
The bomb is no longer armed.

41:22.835 --> 41:24.128
So what happens now, sir?

41:24.962 --> 41:28.299
The FBl will take her
into custody, sergeant.

41:29.592 --> 41:30.843
And then prison?

41:31.302 --> 41:33.512
Your wife is an agent
of a hostile power.

41:33.971 --> 41:35.848
lt all depends what kind
of a deal she can make.

41:36.057 --> 41:39.727
She was also responsible for bringing
down an entire North Korean cell

41:39.894 --> 41:41.437
and saving hundreds of lives,
sergeant.

41:41.937 --> 41:45.441
l'm sure that will be taken into
consideration. Right, Officer David?

41:46.567 --> 41:47.610
Yes, of course.

41:47.777 --> 41:50.738
Her knowledge of the inner workings
of North Korean lntelligence

41:50.905 --> 41:53.366
should proved to be invaluable.

42:14.762 --> 42:16.764
Guys, give her a minute.

42:27.274 --> 42:28.984
l'm

42:29.151 --> 42:31.404
so sorry.

42:32.780 --> 42:36.200
l was trying to do the right thing.

42:38.953 --> 42:41.789
Everything you said to me
on the phone,

42:43.457 --> 42:45.626
l believe in you.

42:47.712 --> 42:50.673
l'll always believe it,
no matter what happens.

42:51.549 --> 42:52.925
Come here.

42:57.596 --> 42:58.889
lt's okay.

43:01.058 --> 43:04.228
- l'm so sorry.
- l know.

43:04.437 --> 43:05.980
Let's go.

43:11.152 --> 43:12.820
Tony,

43:12.987 --> 43:14.822
Ziva, what happened back there
with the bomb,

43:14.989 --> 43:18.117
- l want you both to know--
- You don't have to say it, boss.

43:18.284 --> 43:19.994
We know how you feel about us.

43:20.161 --> 43:21.328
Gibbs, we're a team.

43:21.704 --> 43:23.122
That's what we do.

43:24.373 --> 43:27.460
l was going to say,
if either one of you two wing nuts

43:27.626 --> 43:30.755
ever disobey a direct order again,
l'll kill you myself.

43:36.302 --> 43:38.346
That's our boss.
