NARRATOR: There is a town in Maine...

00:03.254 --> 00:04.243

NARRATOR: ...where every storybook
character you’ve ever known

00:08.968 --> 00:11.050
-(GASPS)
-is trapped between two worlds.

00:11.262 --> 00:14.299
An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy tale characters here?

00:14.432 --> 00:16.263
And now they don't remember
who they are.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.098
NARRATOR: Victims
of a powerful curse.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.216
Everything you love,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.093

00:21.189 --> 00:22.474
will be taken from you.

NARRATOR: Only one knows the truth,

00:24.609 --> 00:27.225
and only one can break her spell.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.355
It's your destiny.

00:28.446 --> 00:29.561
You're gonna bring back
the happy endings.

Do not despair, my dear.
You will attend that ball.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.908
Who are you?

01:21.666 --> 01:23.076
I'm your fairy godmother,

01:23.209 --> 01:25.200
and I'm here to change your life,
Cinderella.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.499
But my stepmother told me
that I couldn't go.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.669
She forbade me to leave.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.464
Your stepmother doesn't have this.

01:32.927 --> 01:37.261
This wand has the power
to take you to your ball,

01:37.348 --> 01:40.090
to your Prince, and to a life...

01:44.272 --> 01:45.512
(GASPS) What?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.139
What did you do?

01:49.402 --> 01:52.519
Now, now, I got what I wanted.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.820
There's no need to be frightened.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.818
No need?

01:56.909 --> 01:58.410
You just killed my fairy godmother!

01:58.536 --> 02:00.197
She was trying to help me.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.368
Was she?

02:02.248 --> 02:04.330
(IN SINGSONG TONE)
Do you know what this is?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.574
Pure magic.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.167
Pure evil.

02:08.713 --> 02:10.999
Trust me. I've done you a favor.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.422
All magic comes with a price.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.044
Go on back to your life,

02:15.469 --> 02:18.381
and thank your lucky stars you
still got something to go back to.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.964
My life is wretched.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.266
Then change it.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.728
You can't handle this.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.190
Wait, please, wait.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.063
I can handle it.

02:34.155 --> 02:37.363
Please, I will do anything
to get out of here, anything.

02:37.950 --> 02:38.939
Anything?

02:39.035 --> 02:41.151
Do you know how
to use that wand, Mister...

02:41.662 --> 02:43.653
Rumplestiltskin.

02:43.748 --> 02:47.081
And, yes, of course I do.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.911
Then help me.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.412
Well, if I do,

02:53.507 --> 02:58.467
and you can indeed
shoulder the consequences,

02:59.930 --> 03:02.262
then you'll owe me a favor.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.723
Name it. What do you want?

03:06.145 --> 03:08.978
Something precious.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.095
But I have nothing.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.642
But you will.

03:11.776 --> 03:16.395
With this wish will come riches
more than you know.

03:16.489 --> 03:17.478
I care nothing for riches.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.606
I'll give you anything you want,
just get me out of here.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.907
Now we're talking.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.825
-How does it work?
-Fear not.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.569
My needs are small.

03:26.123 --> 03:30.662
And all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.036
Do we have a deal?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.666
Yes.

03:35.341 --> 03:36.956
Yes, thank you.

Let's see how they fit, shall we?

04:07.832 --> 04:09.117
Now, you have a good time.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.948
But be sure to watch the clock.

(BELL TOLLING)

04:21.720 --> 04:23.335
You sure we can be out in the open?

04:23.431 --> 04:24.511
Enough sneaking around.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.759
If your mom has a problem
with me walking you to a school bus,

04:26.851 --> 04:30.184
I am more than happy to have that chat.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.809
You're brave.
We'll need that for Operation Cobra.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.141
Speaking of,
do you think we need code names?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.443
Isn't "Cobra” our code name?

04:39.530 --> 04:42.647
That's the mission. I mean us.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.356
I need something to call you.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.736
Oh. Um.

04:50.166 --> 04:54.079
You could just call me Emma for now.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.754
Okay. Well, then,
I'll see you later, Emma.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.105
What's with the siren?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.355
It's so hard to get your attention.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.562
Well, you got it.
Are you arresting me again?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.192
l'm thanking you.

We all owe you a debt of gratitude.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.154
Well, what do | get?
A commendation? A key to the city?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.831
How about a job? I could use a deputy.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.045
Thank you, but I have a job.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.506
As a bail bondsperson?

05:39.590 --> 05:40.921
There's not much of that going on here.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.632
I don't see a lot of sheriffing
going on around here either.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.220

to see it up close.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.582
That's right, I know everything.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.837
-You don't?
-No.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.464
Because you no longer worry me,
Miss Swan.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.509
You see, I did a little digging
into who you are,

06:27.596 --> 06:29.257
and what I found out
was quite soothing.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.763
It all comes down to the number seven.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.976
Seven?

06:33.394 --> 06:36.261
It's the number of addresses
you've had in the last decade.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.808
Your longest stint anywhere
was two years.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.812
Really, what did you enjoy
so much about Tallahassee?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.360
If you're wondering,
I did find a place here in town.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.902

Wait, you don't have one.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.824

Miss Swan, it needs roots.

And you don't have any.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.372

themselves into believing they can.

you think of Henry

Henry, what're you doing here?

14:22.529 --> 14:25.487
My mom's gone till 5:00.
I thought we can hang out.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.237
Kid, lwish I could,
but there's something I gotta do.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.871
Please let me help.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.116
No, it could be dangerous.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.708
The pregnant maid is dangerous?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.999
-She assaulted Mr. Gold.
-Cool.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.747
This isn't a game. She's desperate.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.874
-How do you know?
-Because I know.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.501
Well, then let's find her.

14:43.592 --> 14:47.460
Oh, no, no, no, no. There is no "let's."
You cannot come with me.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.881
Then I'll look for her myself.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.473
Then I'll find you and I'll bring you back.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.297
Then you wouldn't be helping the maid.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.801
I am just trying to be responsible here.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.638
And I'm just trying
to spend time with you.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.943
Oh, that is really not fair.

15:06.698 --> 15:10.441
So, the maid, what's her story?

15:11.036 --> 15:12.526
(FIREWORKS BURSTING)

15:28.178 --> 15:29.167
What's wrong?

15:31.223 --> 15:32.508
Nothing.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.849
Every year when l was growing up,

15:35.936 --> 15:38.894
I used to watch these fireworks
from afar.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.388
I knew what they meant.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.016
That something special was
happening at the palace.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.647
Now they're for me.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.603

we are thrilled
to have you join our family,

Congratulations, Ella.
You two are gonna be very happy.

This is truly a night for celebration.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.635
Do you realize what an inspiration
you are to everyone?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.432
All I did was get married.

17:04.649 --> 17:09.609
All you did was show that anyone
can change her life.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.565
I'm proud of you.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.407
I'm proud of you, too.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.954
You. What're you doing here?

17:29.090 --> 17:32.218

You know, true love, riches.
Happy endings.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.474
Did you get everything you desired?

17:41.770 --> 17:42.759
Yes.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.062
Yes, I did, now what do you want?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.980
What's your price? My jewels?

17:48.985 --> 17:49.974
The ring?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.482
No, no, dear. Keep your baubles.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.735
What I want is
something you don't yet possess,

17:55.825 --> 17:57.406

18:26.189 --> 18:27.429
I thought you were hunting.

18:27.524 --> 18:31.108
l was, but the weather wasn't
agreeing, so we came back early.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.354
Are we going somewhere?

18:35.198 --> 18:36.313
You're going somewhere.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.781
-Something's happened.
-What?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.617
I'm pregnant.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.030
Ella, that's wonderful.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.328
Why are you upset?
This is what we wanted.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.707
There's something else.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.839
When we met that night at the ball,

18:56.761 --> 18:58.877
it wasn't my fairy godmother
who sent me.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.725
It was Rumplestiltskin.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.102
I made a deal with him for this life.
I was stupid.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.095
I didn't understand the price of magic.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.348
So I promised him something.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.058
What did you promise him?

19:13.903 --> 19:15.029
He tricked me.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.236
I thought he'd want our gold orjewels.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.484
What was it?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.200
Our baby?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.283
I'm so sorry.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.207
And now I'm going to lose it all.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.417
My life,

19:36.259 --> 19:37.294
you.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.342
No.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.850
I don't care what that imp said.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.513
Magic may have brought us together,
but it didn't create this love.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.769
But I made a deal.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.148
I can't break that. He's too powerful.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.979
Then the answer is simple.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.156
We make another deal.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.361
So, this boyfriend of hers,

20:06.456 --> 20:08.117
you don't think he was involved
in her disappearance?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.535
That would mean he was involved
with her at all, which he isn't.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.369
He left her in the lurch right after
they found out they were expecting.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.374
Hasn't spoken to her since.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.671
Like I said, he's a...

20:17.967 --> 20:19.958
Hey, hey, hey, Billy! Be careful.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.216
You almost shattered
my wolf thing, Billy. It's good luck.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.136
I'm sorry, Ruby, but look, it's fine.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.471
Ruby, what about her family?

20:29.687 --> 20:34.351
Oh! Um. She's got a stepmom and two
stepsisters that she doesn't talk to.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.559
Wait, stepmom, stepsisters,

20:37.654 --> 20:39.815
-and she's a maid?
-Henry, not now.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.819
Look, I don't know what
you've heard, but it's wrong.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.744
Everyone thinks she's not ready
to have this kid, but she's trying.

20:47.831 --> 20:52.120
Taking night classes, trying to better
herself, trying to get her life together.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.450
Can you understand that?

20:53.545 --> 20:54.910
I think so.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.289
Then maybe you should
just stay out of it.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.746
She's been through enough already.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.002
I've been through it, too, Ruby,
and I can help her.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.674
Then try her ex.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.175
Where can I find him?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.548

21:12.772 --> 21:14.353
I'm Emma Swan.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.983
I'm looking for Ashley Boyd.
She's in trouble.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.731
I just thought maybe
she came to see you.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.859
My son doesn't have anything
to do with that girl anymore.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.908
So whatever trouble she's in,
I am sorry for,

21:26.995 --> 21:28.451
but there's nothing we can do
to help you.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.994
You're the reason he broke up with her.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.321
Absolutely.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.998
I'm not gonna let my son throw away
his entire life over a mistake.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.461
EMMA:
So you just told him to leave her?

21:35.545 --> 21:37.661
What are they gonna do?
Raise the child in the backseat of a car?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.620
Some people only have
the backseat of a car.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.298
Well, they're to be pitied.
I'm not letting that happen to my son.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.296
Dad, maybe we should help her look.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.672
It's a waste, Sean.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.549
Sean, if you wanna come, come.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.551
Stop letting other people
make decisions for you.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.348
If Ashley runs away with this baby,

21:51.436 --> 21:53.176
she's gonna be in some serious trouble.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.727
She's running away with the baby?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.145
-Yes.
-Sean.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.563
Inside.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.559
Now.

22:05.909 --> 22:09.743
Look, believe me, if! knew
where she was, I would tell you.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.444
I went to a lot of trouble
to get her that deal.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.367
Deal? What're you talking about?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.823
You don't know?

22:14.918 --> 22:19.002
Ashley agreed to give up the child,
and she's being paid very well to do so.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.339
She sold the baby?

22:20.423 --> 22:22.584
You make it sound so crass.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.587
I found someone who's going to find
that child a good and proper home.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.837
And who are you to judge whether
Ashley is capable of providing that?

22:28.932 --> 22:31.719
Look at her. She's a teenager.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.970
She's never shown any evidence
of being responsible.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.968
How could she possibly know
how to be a mother?

22:36.105 --> 22:37.606
Maybe she's changing her life.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.100
Everybody says that.

22:39.609 --> 22:40.724
Now look.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.022
I found someone who's going
to pay Ashley extremely well,

22:44.113 --> 22:46.104
someone who's going to see to it
that everybody's happy.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.736
Mr. Gold.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.368
Isn't that why you were hired?
To bring him the baby?

23:00.588 --> 23:04.627
You can't make her double-cross Gold.
No one's ever broken a deal with him.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.877
Happy to be the first.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.085
If Ashley wants to have this baby,
she should have it.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.512
Anyone who wants to be a mother
should damn well be allowed to be one.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.477
Why didn't you tell me
she sold the baby?

23:25.572 --> 23:27.028
Because I didn't think it was important.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.442
Really? Considering that's why
she's running away?

23:29.534 --> 23:33.698
Look, Ashley's my friend. I don't
like the idea of people judging her.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.246
Ruby, where's your car?

23:44.215 --> 23:46.046
You didn't send me to Sean to find her.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.920
You sent me there
to give her a head start.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.171
Look, I'm only trying to help her.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.635
Yeah, so am I.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.587
Ashley's in more trouble
than you know, Ruby.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.013
Where is she?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.178
Don't make her deal with Gold
without me.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.140
I can't talk in front of him.
He's the mayor's kid.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.687
Hey, I'm on your side.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.401
Henry, I need to find this woman.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.740
And in order to do that,
I need you to go home, okay?

24:09.866 --> 24:11.481
So please listen to me.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.066
Seriously.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.072
She's not going to tell me anything
if you're around.

-Okay.
-Thank you.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.085
She left town.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.502
She said she was gonna try Boston,
thought she could disappear there.

24:28.593 --> 24:29.958
How long ago did she leave?

24:30.261 --> 24:31.876
About a half an hour.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.553
What'd she tell you?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.518
Henry! What the hell?

24:45.109 --> 24:47.646
I'm going to Boston.
You can't come with me.

24:47.737 --> 24:51.070
You can't go to Boston! She can't leave.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.818
Bad things happen to anyone that does.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.901
I don't have time to argue with you
over the curse.

24:55.995 --> 24:56.984
I got to get you home.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.116
We have to stop her
before she gets hurt.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.538
We're wasting time.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.490
If you drop me off,
you'll never catch up to her.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.574
Henry...

25:03.670 --> 25:07.083
Then Mr. Gold will call the police,
and he'll have her sent to jail.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.416
Buckle up.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.256
Ashley, what did you get yourself into?

25:19.477 --> 25:20.592
Why are we down here?

25:20.812 --> 25:22.427
We need a place to keep him.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.434
Rumplestiltskin is the most
dangerous man in all the realms.

25:25.525 --> 25:30.360
He needs his own special prison,
so we converted the mines to hold him.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.823
But how will we get him here?
He's eluded all forever.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.364
His strength is also his weakness.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.113
His deals. He can't resist making them,

25:38.204 --> 25:40.616
and we already know
who he wants to deal with next.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.743
You.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.167
We've sent word with
one of Snow's bluebirds.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.664
He's accepted a meeting with you.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.336
You're gonna tell him that
Doc heard something

25:49.424 --> 25:51.540
with his stethoscope, two heartbeats.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.215
You're going to tell him it's twins.

25:53.302 --> 25:58.262
And if he wants both, which he will,
you propose a new deal.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.806
Grumpy.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.644
A quill? I don't understand.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.472
The Blue Fairy cast a spell on it.

26:07.567 --> 26:10.434
Whoever signs with this will be frozen,
their magic made impotent.

26:10.862 --> 26:14.354
All you must do is
get him to sign the contract.

26:14.449 --> 26:17.316
Ella, this man is a scourge.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.651
You will be doing the entire land
a service.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.987
But should we even use magic?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.992
Isn't that what's causing
these problems to begin with?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.698
What if this magic also has a price?

26:25.793 --> 26:27.374
Then I will pay it.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.124
I will do whatever is needed
to save you and our child.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.008
Let's go.

26:46.647 --> 26:50.139
I hope you like it.
A lot of Dwarf blood went into it.

26:53.488 --> 26:54.773
You sure this'll work?

26:54.864 --> 26:57.571
Once he's in there, he'll never get out.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.398
You'll be safe.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.531
I can do this, Ella.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.035
Okay.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.493
Let's get him.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.047
I told you.

27:20.223 --> 27:21.429
It's her car.

27:30.900 --> 27:31.889
Ashley?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.727
(ASHLEY MOANING)

27:38.950 --> 27:40.065
My baby.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.742
It's coming.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.408
(ASHLEY MOANING IN PAIN)

27:48.876 --> 27:50.252
Is the baby really coming?

27:50.336 --> 27:51.667
Oh, yeah.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.119
Don't worry, the hospital isn't that far.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.502
No! No, no, no! Take me to Boston.
I can't go back there.

27:56.592 --> 27:59.208
No, we don't have four hours.
Trust me, I know.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.591
I can't go back there, please.
He's gonna take my baby.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.513
I won't let that happen.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.682
But do you know what you're
asking for if you keep this child?

28:06.769 --> 28:08.475
-Are you really ready?
-Yeah.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.936
Are you sure? Because I wasn't.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.684
-You weren't?
-Nope.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.724
If you want to give this kid
its best chance,

28:14.819 --> 28:17.151
it's gonna be with someone who
is ready, so know what that means.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.478
Your whole life is gonna change,

28:18.614 --> 28:21.822
and once you decide that it's yours,
this running away can't happen.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.741
You have to grow up,
and you can't ever leave.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.696
-Understand?
-Yes.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.078
I want my baby.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.968
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Well, well, well.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.600
You're starting to show.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.932
A little bird told me
you wanted to speak.

28:56.027 --> 28:57.392
Yes.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.571
I'd like to alter the bargain.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.063
That's not what I do.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.648
But I think you'll want to.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.487
I'm having twins.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.579
Is that so?

29:11.959 --> 29:13.039
Ooh!

29:13.169 --> 29:15.160
Let's have a look.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.630
(GRUNTS)

29:17.006 --> 29:20.339
And you would, what? Give up both?

29:23.054 --> 29:25.340
Why is that, I wonder?

29:26.599 --> 29:30.717
My husband, he's having a hard time.

29:30.811 --> 29:34.975
Our kingdom is poor. We're losing
money. Our crops are dying.

29:35.066 --> 29:38.650
We can't support ourselves
or our people.

29:38.736 --> 29:42.854
And you would trade your other child

29:44.075 --> 29:45.690
for comfort?

29:46.369 --> 29:47.700
I can always have more children.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.905
But I can't make crops grow
where the soil is dead.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.955
In exchange for our other child,

29:55.211 --> 29:57.372
you will see to it
that our land is once again fertile.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.545
-I think it's more than fair.
-Yes!

30:01.092 --> 30:02.207
Yes, yes.

30:03.052 --> 30:04.041
It is.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.669
If what you're saying is true.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.133
It is.

30:08.349 --> 30:13.013
And all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.353
What a lovely quill.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.821
Wherever did you get it?

30:23.572 --> 30:25.073
It's from our castle.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.951
You know, the only way to stop me
is through magic.

30:33.624 --> 30:34.704
I'm not trying to stop you.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.908
Of course you're not.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.334
Because as we all know,

30:38.963 --> 30:41.170
all magic comes with a price.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.717
And if you were to use it to, say,

30:44.385 --> 30:45.921
imprison me,

30:46.345 --> 30:50.384
then your debt to me would only grow.

30:50.474 --> 30:53.261
And we wouldn't want that,
now would we?

30:54.979 --> 30:56.935
Just sign the contract, please.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.898
Are you sure you're happy
with this new arrangement?

31:09.827 --> 31:12.068
Then so it shall be.

31:19.712 --> 31:20.701
Thomas!

31:20.963 --> 31:24.126
No one breaks deals with me, dearie.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.966
No one.

31:28.596 --> 31:29.881
No matter where you are,

31:29.972 --> 31:33.055
no matter what land you find yourself in,

31:33.142 --> 31:38.227
I assure you, I will have your baby.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.975
You know, Emma, you're different.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.438
What's that?

31:45.780 --> 31:47.441
You're the only one who can do it.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.865
Break the curse? Yes, I know.
You keep telling me that.

31:51.952 --> 31:52.941
No.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.785
Leave.

31:54.872 --> 31:56.828
You're the only one
who can leave Storybrooke.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.499
You left and came
and found me in Boston.

32:01.629 --> 32:05.668
But I came back.
I'm 10. I had no choice.

32:05.758 --> 32:09.797
But if anyone else tried to go,
bad things would happen.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.050
Anyone except me.

32:13.182 --> 32:17.095
You're the savior.
You can do whatever you want.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.972
You can go.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.769
Miss Swan,
the baby is a healthy six-pound girl.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.528
And the mother is doing fine.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.020
What lovely news.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.523
Excellent work, Miss Swan.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.574
Thank you for bringing me
my merchandise.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.082
Did we really win?

32:46.173 --> 32:48.789
Yes, I told you we would.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.135
l was so afraid.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.511
l was so afraid that we'd fail,

32:53.597 --> 32:56.088
that I'd have to go back to that life.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.720
That terrible life.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.721
I was afraid that I'll lose you,
and that nothing would've changed.

33:03.023 --> 33:06.186
As long as I'm alive,
you will never go back to that life.

33:11.365 --> 33:14.573
Now, how is our little Alexandra?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.033
Alexandra?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.610
Did I not mention
that I picked out a name?

33:17.746 --> 33:20.032
A name?
That's more like a prison sentence.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.785
Well, I like it.

33:21.876 --> 33:24.288
Men, you really know nothing of...

33:25.421 --> 33:26.536
Ella, what is it?

33:26.630 --> 33:29.872
It's the baby. Something's wrong.

33:29.967 --> 33:31.252
No, no, it can't be. It's too soon.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.423
It must be the stress, the excitement.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.339
l'm dizzy.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.510
Sit, sit.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.177
-I'Il go get you water.
-Okay.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.276
(LEAVES RUSTLING)

33:54.617 --> 33:55.948
(GASPING)

33:57.995 --> 34:02.864
Thomas! It's okay. It's passed.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.461
Thomas?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.595
Thomas?

34:24.230 --> 34:25.561
Thomas?

34:27.316 --> 34:28.431
What did you do?

34:29.485 --> 34:31.396
-Ella, what's wrong?
-Your highness, what happened?

34:31.487 --> 34:33.398
What did you do to my Thomas?

34:33.489 --> 34:35.275
I haven't done anything.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.982
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been otherwise engaged.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.568
Something's happened to him.
You know. Tell me!

34:41.747 --> 34:43.487
I have no idea, dearie.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.497
But I did warn you.

34:46.377 --> 34:49.119
All magic comes at a price.

34:49.463 --> 34:54.332
Looks like someone has just paid.

34:54.468 --> 34:56.584
Don't listen to him. We'll find Thomas.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.294
No, you won't.

34:58.389 --> 35:02.723
Until that debt is paid,
until that baby is mine,

35:02.851 --> 35:05.513
you're never gonna see him again.

35:06.188 --> 35:09.021
In this world or the next, Cinderella,

35:09.149 --> 35:10.855
lwill have that baby!

35:23.664 --> 35:24.904
Well, well.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.664
Must be my lucky day.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.492
Would you care for a cup, Miss Swan?

35:29.586 --> 35:33.545
A baby? That's your merchandise?
Why didn't you tell me?

35:34.883 --> 35:37.841
Because at the time,
you didn't need to know.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.214
Really? Or you thought
I wouldn't take the job?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.967
On the contrary,

35:43.058 --> 35:46.721
I thought it would be more effective
if you found out yourself.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.804
After seeing Ashley's hard life,

35:49.898 --> 35:53.026
I thought it would make sense to you.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.522
I mean, if anyone could understand
the reasons behind giving up a baby,

35:56.613 --> 35:57.989
I assumed it would be you.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.406
You're not getting that kid.

36:01.493 --> 36:06.453
Actually, we have an agreement, and
my agreements are always honored.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.365
If not, I'm going to have
to involve the police,

36:09.460 --> 36:12.918
and that baby is gonna end up
in the system.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.211
And that would be a pity.

36:14.673 --> 36:18.211
You didn't enjoy your time
in the system, did you, Emma?

36:18.302 --> 36:19.758
That's not gonna happen.

36:20.137 --> 36:23.095
I like your confidence. Charming.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.509
But all I have to do is press charges.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.933
She did, after all, break into my shop.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.726
Let me guess, to steal a contract.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.773
Who knows what she was after?

36:31.899 --> 36:34.390
You know no jury in the world
will put a woman in jail

36:34.485 --> 36:38.603
whose only reason for breaking
and entering was to keep her child.

36:40.783 --> 36:44.275
I'm willing to roll the dice
that contract doesn't stand up.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.110
Are you?

36:46.622 --> 36:49.455
Not to mention what might come out
about you in the process.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.080
Somehow, I suspect there is more
to you than a simple pawnbroker.

36:54.505 --> 36:56.120
You really want to start that fight?

36:59.134 --> 37:01.125
I like you, Miss Swan.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.344
You're not afraid of me.
That's either cocky or presumptuous.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.384
Either way,
I'd rather have you on my side.

37:06.475 --> 37:07.464
So she can keep the baby?

37:07.601 --> 37:10.388
Not just yet.

37:10.479 --> 37:15.064
There's still the matter
of my agreement with Miss Boyd.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.310
Tear it up.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.821
That's not what I do.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.816
You see, contracts,

37:22.491 --> 37:24.197
deals,

37:24.284 --> 37:27.822
they're the very foundation
of all civilized existence.

37:28.831 --> 37:31.072
So I put it to you now.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.124
If you want Ashley to have that baby,

37:34.211 --> 37:36.668
are you willing to make a deal with me?

37:37.840 --> 37:38.829
What do you want?

37:38.966 --> 37:41.002
Oh, I don't knowjust yet.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.510
You'll owe me a favor.

37:50.519 --> 37:51.634
Deal.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.865
Hey.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.025
What's her name?

38:08.245 --> 38:09.826
Alexandra.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.116
It's pretty.

38:13.125 --> 38:14.956
Thank you for getting me here.

38:15.586 --> 38:17.201
Mr. Gold was outside.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.876
I took care of it.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.416
She's yours.

38:20.549 --> 38:22.164
She is?

38:23.719 --> 38:24.879
What did you do?

38:25.637 --> 38:26.888
Made a deal with him.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.676
Thank you.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.851
Thank you.

38:36.398 --> 38:40.061
Oh. Hey, kid, it's almost 5:00.
We gotta get you home.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.239
(SHOWER RUNNING)

38:52.956 --> 38:57.575
I have to go.
Henry's expecting me home at 5:00.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.958
But I'll see you again

39:03.634 --> 39:05.920
at the next council meeting.

39:07.429 --> 39:11.547
And don't forget,
you left your socks under the bed.

in honor of Cinderella, Pumpkin.

39:25.239 --> 39:27.605
-You got a better one in mind?
-Yup.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.781
Well?

39:31.078 --> 39:32.784
I'm not sure you're ready yet.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.455
Henry?

39:47.177 --> 39:49.919
About what you said at the hospital,
about me being able to leave?

39:50.264 --> 39:51.253
Yeah?

39:52.641 --> 39:53.801
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.608
Henry?

40:16.540 --> 40:17.655
Henry?

40:19.042 --> 40:20.782
What did I tell you?

40:22.671 --> 40:23.877
Do not

40:25.215 --> 40:28.332
leave your shoes
lying around on the stairs.

40:29.845 --> 40:31.506
Someone could get hurt.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.187
I am so sorry.

40:52.034 --> 40:53.069
You're back.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.578
Yeah, I'm back.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.356
Graham, it's Emma.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.565
l was thinking,
