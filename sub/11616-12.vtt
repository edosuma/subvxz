LOMMERS (on recording):
I'm here today to confess.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.607
You have been misled.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.042
The virus was manipulated

04:37.044 --> 04:40.412
in a lab
here in our own country

04:40.414 --> 04:42.547
through a dangerous
and irresponsible

04:42.549 --> 04:44.483
Gain-of-Function study.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.285
These studies are currently
not permissible

04:46.287 --> 04:48.687
in the United States

04:48.689 --> 04:51.223

like this one.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.258
This virus was created

04:53.260 --> 04:57.462
by a scientist at the CDC
named Dr. Victor Cannerts.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.165

The Syrian ambassador

either confirm or deny

I just watched Teresa
have a baby in the clean room.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.388
In my present condition,
I'm all for it.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.522
How are we supposed

05:57.524 --> 05:58.990
to find $5,000 a head?

05:58.992 --> 06:00.992
Well, we already have
almost $10,000, and

06:00.994 --> 06:01.927
it doesn't have to be cash.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.061
He said he'd take stuff
he can pawn.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.030
Not to be all realistic,
but unless Meese wants

06:05.032 --> 06:06.865
to be paid in swivel chairs,
there's nothing worth

06:06.867 --> 06:09.868
anything left in this building.
Well, then, we're just gonna
have to dig a little deeper.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.636
We need to scour
the building, and fast

06:11.638 --> 06:14.539
if we're gonna meet Meese
tonight to start our quarantine.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.841
CSO tunnels will look good

06:22.349 --> 06:23.749
So, we're not going.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.284
We're heading to
my grandma's house.

Hey, look, if a bunch

06:32.493 --> 06:34.025

kid into the world,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.161

Maybe when

freeze-dried.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.280

Look who's back.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.520
Food Drop Cowboy.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.489
Technically, it's Officer Riley.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.857
Technically, you're
in my jurisdiction,

07:56.643 --> 07:58.643
My, oh, my.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.213
Less than ten cops
left in the Cordon.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.348
Two are my guests.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.150
Cinco, get the boys

08:05.152 --> 08:08.320
and rustle up a bottle
of bourbon for the man.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.521
CINCO:
Come on, man.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.989
Mm-hmm.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.592
MAN:
All right.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.827

08:56.103 --> 08:58.270
(grunts softly)

09:20.327 --> 09:21.693
So Sam is right.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.828
This entire building
has been picked clean.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.398
Not the entire building.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.233
Guess what survived the attack.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.702
Computer drives?
Not just any computer drives.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.004
This one's
from Phillips Merchant Bank.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.272
There's, like,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.575
a thousand credit
card numbers on here.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.109
That's gonna raise a ton
on the black market.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.445
So you want to go from the
Cordon straight to prison?

09:40.447 --> 09:41.980
Minimum security prison.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.715
It's better
than this place.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.750
And who's gonna prove
we did it?

09:45.752 --> 09:49.087
Look, Meese just wants
to make money, right?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.957
Maybe we offer him
the three-for-two deal.
(scoffs)

09:51.959 --> 09:53.158
JANA:
The only way
to find out

09:53.160 --> 09:55.060

09:55.062 --> 09:56.461

10:02.869 --> 10:07.172
It's damn hard to get drunk

10:10.611 --> 10:13.144
When Cinco and me were kids,

10:13.146 --> 10:15.180
we'd steal two
or three pulls

10:15.182 --> 10:19.184
off my mama's stash,
and we'd get lit.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.886
Especially Cinco.

10:21.888 --> 10:25.056
That kid
would just fall over laughing.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.626
No tolerance.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.929
One day, our cousin got shot.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.768
Not enough liquor in the whole
world to make it better.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.640
Some stuff...

10:41.642 --> 10:44.376
nothing'll take the edge off.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.213
Just is what it is.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.823
SAM:
Actually,

10:58.825 --> 11:00.725
I need to see Meese.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.495
I believe
Mr. Meese

11:03.497 --> 11:05.196
is presently open for business.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.400
What the hell was that about?

11:08.402 --> 11:10.602
(sighs)
Escaping the Cordon.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.671
Meese has a way to get out.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.176

<i> It's so good to see you both.</i>

11:18.178 --> 11:19.244
Micheline,

11:19.246 --> 11:22.681
we've got company.
Oh! Teresa!

11:22.683 --> 11:24.449
Hi.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.051
Why are you limping, Grandpa?

11:26.053 --> 11:29.688
Oh, not to worry.
It's, uh, just a little sprain.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.956
Oh, my goodness, is that...

11:31.958 --> 11:35.427
I thought you should meet
your great-granddaughter.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.062
Oh.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.265
Oh, honey,
she's perfect.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.834
Were you able
to get to a hospital

11:42.836 --> 11:45.437
or did your mom help you
with the birth?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.710
Mom wasn't there.

11:51.712 --> 11:55.346
Has she seen her yet?

11:55.348 --> 11:56.781
Grandma, I...

11:56.783 --> 11:58.383
I don't know how to...

12:00.020 --> 12:02.454
Is Leanne all right?

12:02.456 --> 12:05.457
Um... no, Bert.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.893
She's gone, isn't she?

12:11.098 --> 12:14.232
I had a feeling.
Oh, Michi...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.434
We wondered,
when we hadn't heard from her.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.702
I'm so sorry.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.504

12:19.506 --> 12:20.739
Oh, my love,
is...

12:20.741 --> 12:23.274
is there anything
we can do for you?

12:24.845 --> 12:27.045
(sniffles)

12:27.047 --> 12:29.047
Yes.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.916
I want to hold
her granddaughter.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.419
We can do that.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.766
Have you chosen a name?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.768
It's Leanne.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.070

13:00.480 --> 13:03.047
JANA:
It's safe, Jake.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.617

gonna say, but...

13:05.619 --> 13:07.552
but I miss Lex.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.654
I have to try.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.858
So please don't judge me.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.528
I don't.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.401
Something's wrong.
What happened?

13:25.539 --> 13:27.539
Hey.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.674
Tell me.

13:29.676 --> 13:33.278
I took your advice.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.416
I told Katie I loved her.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.253
Jake?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.690
Oh, no.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.093
Oh, no.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.830
Oh, Jake,
I'm so sorry.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.698
The last thing
she asked me to do

13:53.700 --> 13:55.567
was to get her son out of here.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.139
Jake, come with us.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.440
SAM:
Meese won't
make a deal.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.077
(sighs)

14:06.079 --> 14:07.879
Look, I-I know you say
we're all in this together,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.547
but I need to get home to Nick.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.116
I have to do this, Jana,
even if I'm going alone.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.718
Okay, we still have
a few more hours.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.855
Okay? We will
find a way.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.390
And you need to find
a way, too, Jake.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.566
Come on. Come on.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.568
ROY:
What did you find
in Leo's storage?

14:30.570 --> 14:34.272
LEX:
A name I've never heard before.
Katrina Hobbs.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.274
Whoever paid off Meese's wife

14:36.276 --> 14:39.510
gave Katrina Hobbs $250,000.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.012
She has no priors.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.847
Sounds
like you're onto something.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.148
You better move quick.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.417
Yeah, but she could be any one
with these names.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.853
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.655
Wait.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.857
Found an old obit.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.859
"Former Army Corporal
Noah Hobbs,

14:54.861 --> 14:57.662
"27, beloved son
of Katrina Hobbs,

14:57.664 --> 15:00.131
"died in a workplace accident.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.634
"A CBRN specialist, he served in

15:02.636 --> 15:05.036
Afghanistan and Iraq."

15:05.038 --> 15:06.671
Well-well, what's CBRN?

15:06.673 --> 15:10.909
Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.077
I'd start with her.

15:14.247 --> 15:14.946
Yeah.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.059
(chuckles)
Don't worry about him.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.694
You did your quarantine.
You're getting out.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.630
I should shut you down,
you money-grubbing dirtbag.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.332
You here to give me a lecture?

15:37.137 --> 15:39.470
I'm here to see
if you'll take two more.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.246
(indistinct shouting nearby)

15:52.352 --> 15:53.918
Oh, please. Please
leave that to us.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.655
No.
Yes, yes. You should take
a nap before you go, Teresa.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.958
Actually, Grandma,
we were hoping it'd be okay

15:59.960 --> 16:01.292
to stay here with you
for a while.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.629
Xander, let me do that.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.999
Oh, it's fine.
You should rest, with that leg.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.267
It's the least...

16:09.269 --> 16:10.568
We'll just rinse the dishes.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.406
(crying)

16:16.710 --> 16:18.242
(quietly):
It's all an act.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.777
They must've used
the last food they had on us.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.347
They don't have enough
for themselves, let alone us.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.616
We can share our MREs
until the next food drop.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.252
The food drop Trey will steal
and make us pay for?

16:28.254 --> 16:30.288
Tee, we've got to do
the escape plan.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.123
I'm just thinking of Leanne.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.159
What if something goes wrong
in one of those tunnels?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.828
You don't know that
we could keep her safe.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.998
And even if we could, how
are we supposed to come up

16:40.000 --> 16:41.833
with $15,000?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.102
We're not
going anywhere.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.670
(water running)

16:45.672 --> 16:48.673
ANNOUNCER:
The ACLU continues its efforts
to restore communication

16:48.675 --> 16:51.275
inside the Cordon, as
they prepare to bring their case

to both the state...

16:53.847 --> 16:56.047
Katrina Hobbs?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.917
Atlanta PD.
I'm chasing a cold case.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.653
I was hoping
you might be able to help.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.622
Is that a new car?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.024
Nice ride.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.593
Did you win the lottery?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.595
Farthest thing from it.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.598
My son Noah came back
from Afghanistan in one piece

17:13.600 --> 17:15.733
and then died falling off
a ladder at work

17:15.735 --> 17:17.035
over a year
ago now.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.037
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.072
His company gave me
a settlement.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.474
What kind of work did he do?

17:23.476 --> 17:27.078
He was a clerk at Anderson
Supply, in the warehouse.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.714
Where's the warehouse?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.183
I've never been there,
but I know it's off

17:32.185 --> 17:34.318
Route 92 by
the mini-mart.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.455
I'm sorry, but if I'm late
for my doctor's appointment...

17:37.457 --> 17:40.691
Of course. Of course. Thank you
so much, ma'am. You've been...

17:40.693 --> 17:42.060
really helpful.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.197
QUENTIN:
<i> I don't know, Jake.</i>

17:46.199 --> 17:48.332
It's your call, Q.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.035
I promised your mom
I'd get you out, and...

17:51.037 --> 17:52.970
and I think
this is the way.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.505
We have to go tonight.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.208
But this is the last place
I saw her.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.677
The farther I go
from here...
I know.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.613
But you know the...

18:02.615 --> 18:04.682
that question
you were asking me earlier,

18:04.684 --> 18:06.384
about where she is now?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.618
Yeah.

18:07.620 --> 18:11.355
Well, look, I-I won't lie
to you, I don't...

18:11.357 --> 18:13.524
I don't know how
it works, exactly,

18:13.526 --> 18:16.227
but I know that your mom
loved you very much.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.963
I know that people
that love us, uh,

18:18.965 --> 18:20.832
they stay with us.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.302
Even from far away?

18:25.105 --> 18:28.506
Even from far away.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.977
And if she wasn't with us
right now,

18:32.979 --> 18:35.513
why would I...
be so worried about doing

18:35.515 --> 18:39.450
what she asked me to
and making her proud?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.523
What if I don't want to go?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.825
Well, then we stay here
together.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.461
I'm only going if you do.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.830
Hey, you're my deputy.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.200
What do you say?

18:57.036 --> 18:58.936
My mom wanted it.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.738
We should go.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.343
(hinges creaking)

19:19.058 --> 19:20.558

he got to go!

20:38.838 --> 20:40.838
(chanting continues)

20:45.078 --> 20:47.912
Sounds like the doctor's
a dead man.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.747
CANNERTS:
Having been immunized
using antibodies

20:49.749 --> 20:52.550
derived from Thomas Graham's
blood serum,

20:52.552 --> 20:55.353
Katie Frank survived longer
than anyone.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.555
But her death,
due to the virus,

20:57.557 --> 21:00.191
suggests that this antiserum
treatment alone

21:00.193 --> 21:02.560
isn't effective.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.363
The only known patient
to survive the acute phase

21:05.365 --> 21:08.266
of the virus into an
asymptomatic latent phase

21:08.268 --> 21:10.268
is Thomas Graham, but why?

21:10.270 --> 21:11.836
What makes him unique?

21:11.838 --> 21:16.440
Blood tests reveal that Thomas
naturally produces

21:16.442 --> 21:19.110
extremely high levels
of interferon.

21:19.112 --> 21:23.414
It may be that these elevated
levels of interferon

21:23.416 --> 21:26.450
are protective.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.955
It's possible
that combining interferon

21:30.957 --> 21:33.691
with antiserum derived
from Thomas' blood

21:33.693 --> 21:37.094
might stimulate the immune
system to fight the virus,

21:37.096 --> 21:39.764
thus preventing the patient
from being overwhelmed.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.737
Dr. Cannerts?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.340
Hey.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.708
We need to talk.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.710
Jake, I've been working
since dawn

21:52.712 --> 21:54.145
and I realize
it's a small comfort,

21:54.147 --> 21:57.548
but you should know
that what we learned from Katie

21:57.550 --> 21:59.317
may eventually lead
to a vaccine.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.786
Eventually. Yeah.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.321
'Cause the thing is...
TREY: Well,

22:03.323 --> 22:05.589
if it isn't Dr. Death himself.
Excuse me.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.291
Gentlemen.
Hey, what's going on, Trey?

22:07.293 --> 22:08.859
Oh, same old, same old.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.728
After blaming the brown kid
from Syria,

22:10.730 --> 22:13.130
turns out he had nothing
to do with this mess.

22:13.132 --> 22:17.201
News from the outside says
Dr. Cannerts created the virus.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.170
The way I see it,

22:19.172 --> 22:21.639
somebody's got to put a bullet
in the man's head.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.241
You raise that thing
and I will throw your ass

22:24.243 --> 22:26.610
in the isolation ward
without a mask.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.479
So, whoever it is
you're grieving

22:28.481 --> 22:30.748
died from natural causes?

22:32.051 --> 22:34.585
Look, I'm not crazy
about him either,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.020
but Cannerts didn't
create the virus.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.888
He's trying to save everyone
in the Cordon.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.791
And like it or not,
he's the only one who can.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.493
Yeah, well, the word is out.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.894
If I don't do it,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.397
somebody else will.
(gun clicks)

22:46.399 --> 22:48.899
Yeah, yeah, but if you
help me protect him,

22:48.901 --> 22:51.135
you and your guys can be first
in line for a vaccine.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.373
There's a vaccine?

22:55.375 --> 22:56.941
He just told me
he's getting close.

23:02.248 --> 23:03.514
Fine.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.516
(gun clicks)
We'll protect him.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.852
First in line, right, Doc?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.521
Welcome to the Cordon P.D.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.655

23:11.657 --> 23:12.656
Cinco, you hear that?

23:12.658 --> 23:14.291
CINCO: Let's do it.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.893
TREY:
Come on.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.541
You know, years ago, after
your mom's dad passed away,

23:30.543 --> 23:33.310
I took her and went back
to my parents' house

23:33.312 --> 23:36.480
because it was familiar
and safe.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.149
I can't imagine you scared.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.418
Oh, I was a mess.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.686
And then I met Bert.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.055
I-it shames me to say it

23:45.057 --> 23:50.861
but I grew up in what was known
as a sundown town.

23:50.863 --> 23:55.166
No black person walking around
after sundown was safe.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.101
That's insane.
Yeah.

23:57.103 --> 24:01.839
The first time Bert came over,
he left before sundown,

24:01.841 --> 24:04.241
but that wasn't good enough
for our neighbors.

24:04.243 --> 24:08.813
The next day your mother came
home from school black and blue.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.650
I left the very next day.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.289
I realized that I could not
buy my security

24:18.291 --> 24:21.225
at the expense of my daughters.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.530
Being here may feel safe
to you,

24:26.532 --> 24:30.167
but nowhere in the Cordon
is safe.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.607
Do you know the phrase
"carpe diem"?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.142
"Seize the day."

24:38.144 --> 24:41.345
Well, I was planning
to give you this on your 21st,

24:41.347 --> 24:43.814
but carpe diem, right?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.221
Grandma, your pearls.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.690
Pearls? That's funny.

24:53.926 --> 24:58.062
I see three tickets out of here
for you and your family.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.903
CANNERTS:<i> I'm nowhere near</i>
<i> having a vaccine,</i>

25:05.905 --> 25:07.805
and you know it.
I said you were working on one.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.206
That's the only reason
they're protecting you.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.575
Look, as long as they think
they have something to gain,

25:11.577 --> 25:13.544
they'll keep you
safe after I go.

25:13.546 --> 25:14.979
Well, where are you going?

25:14.981 --> 25:16.647
Without you here...

25:16.649 --> 25:18.649
Yeah, I know.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.851
Believe me, if I could be in
two places at once, I would.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.155
Just keep trying to find
a way to stop the virus.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.790
You'll be fine.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.266
I'm sorry.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.942
(grunting)
SUZY: I've decided I'm quitting.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.211
Too many memories.
(grunting)

25:47.213 --> 25:49.713
I hate to break it to you,
but there isn't any job to quit.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.049
I just want to get
into this stupid safe.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.552
The only thing he kept in there
were private contracts.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.121
Yeah, but still,
Dennis had a gun, right?

25:57.123 --> 25:58.689
And guys who have guns,
usually have more than one.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.424
I mean, Meese would take that.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.326
It doesn't matter.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.828
Unless you plan on throwing
that safe out the window,

26:04.830 --> 26:06.063
the only way
you're going to open it

26:06.065 --> 26:07.831
is to figure out
the combination.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.733
(sighs)
Fine.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.702
(exhales)

26:11.704 --> 26:12.836
You knew Dennis

26:12.838 --> 26:14.405
better than anyone--
give me a number.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.673
(groans):
Oh, Jana...

26:15.675 --> 26:17.174

Henry Burns did.

It's a miracle that Noah Hobbs
didn't leave that building

29:44.383 --> 29:45.949
after he was infected.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.919

you set Henry Burns up
with a new facility

29:56.529 --> 29:57.928
to recreate the virus.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.531
Then 19 days ago
he accidentally gets infected

30:00.533 --> 30:02.766
by his own virus, but now

30:02.768 --> 30:04.334
you can't shut it down.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.637

What can I say, Lex?

30:16.549 --> 30:18.415
Guilty as charged.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.323
So you admit it.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.393
If you're accusing me of
protecting the population,

30:29.395 --> 30:30.561
then yes,

30:30.563 --> 30:31.829
I'm guilty.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.363
Do you know what
the budget is

30:33.365 --> 30:35.566
to defend...
I didn't come here
to talk about...

30:35.568 --> 30:36.767
The country's budget to defend

30:36.769 --> 30:38.836
against a nuclear attack
is $20 billion.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.604
The budget to defend
against bioterrorism

30:40.606 --> 30:42.105
is less than a quarter of that.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.374
In order to create and launch
a nuclear weapon,

30:44.376 --> 30:46.743
you need, among other things,
uranium and plutonium.

30:46.745 --> 30:47.845
Hard to find.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.012
Harder to process.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.215
In order to create a
bio-weapon, you need

30:51.217 --> 30:53.250
an okay scientist and a dream.

30:53.252 --> 30:56.220
So you put us all at risk
in case they do?

30:56.222 --> 30:58.155
Sometimes protecting people
puts them at risk.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.390
But if there is a virus
that can be mutated

31:00.392 --> 31:02.392
to be deadly,
we need to know it.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.528
If we can mutate this virus,
so can our enemies.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.630
If we can mutate it
and create a cure,

31:06.632 --> 31:08.282
then we can survive an attack.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.933
It's that simple.
But with government
funding cuts

31:09.935 --> 31:11.268
and pharmaceuticals

31:11.270 --> 31:13.203
focused on the next
little blue pill,

31:13.205 --> 31:15.239
staying ahead of the game
isn't easy.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.874
Who are you staying ahead of?

31:16.876 --> 31:18.308
Sayid Nassir?

31:18.310 --> 31:19.376
The innocent kid

31:19.378 --> 31:21.311
that you-you pinned
this outbreak on?

31:21.313 --> 31:25.515
The Syrians who you falsely
accused of attacking us? Me?

31:25.517 --> 31:26.550
Leo Greene said

31:26.552 --> 31:29.887
that we were the loose ends
that you needed to tie up.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.688
You're letting conspiracies
go to your head.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.324
I...
Can you not see
how twisted this is?!

31:34.326 --> 31:36.660
Are you aware of the
significance of August 23?

31:36.662 --> 31:38.161
No.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.664
Because that's the day the
federal government prevented

31:40.666 --> 31:43.166
the last bioterror attack.

31:43.168 --> 31:47.638
Nobody hands out attaboys
for not dying of the plague.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.339

Just following orders, Lex.

Let me see him.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.842
No sign of the virus.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.378
We need to have him

40:09.007 --> 40:10.874
But he is.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.045
Look, I know
it's...

40:16.047 --> 40:19.082
I know it's a lot to ask.
