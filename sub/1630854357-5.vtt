I just haven't heard
from them in months.

And I haven't really been able
to talk to B.

Any sign on how
to fulfill my mission.

I pray that you'll
let them know

You've been keeping me

- The best thing you can do

15:49.532 --> 15:52.577
for Bob is make sure
this trial doesn't go forward.

your husband to the stand.

embarrassed in public,

16:06.216 --> 16:09.678
it's only fair everyone hears
the full story.

He's not. You tricked him.

she was gonna say any of that.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.677
I hate what these lawyers
are putting us through.

If I'm under oath,
I can't lie, can I?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.224
- Wait, Mary Ann. Hey. Hey.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.518
W-what if I take a plea?

17:46.858 --> 17:49.819
There's no trial.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.781
And I'll--I'll plead guilty.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.784
I'll do that for you.

17:58.828 --> 18:03.124
then yes, of course
you should take it.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.627
- Right.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.671
Then I'll just speak
to Jan first.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.339
- Why?

18:09.381 --> 18:11.800
- [sighs] So I can explain it
to her.

You know, you'd be sparing him
a lifetime of shame

- Pete, he had her in Mexico

I mean, does this seem fair

44:29.419 --> 44:31.504

the suspended sentence

44:34.382 --> 44:36.634
Anywhere he tries to go,

45:08.083 --> 45:09.709
- Well, there's
this amazing theater.

45:09.751 --> 45:11.378
It's wonderful.

45:11.419 --> 45:14.172
And they've got professional
actors and everything.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.341
I could be

45:16.383 --> 45:17.717
I hear they're doing
a production

45:17.759 --> 45:19.052

it's not really in town.

It's in Jackson Hole.

for you too.

45:47.622 --> 45:48.915

45:48.957 --> 45:50.542
- Financially.

45:50.583 --> 45:52.919
Dad's income can't really
give us the life we want.

45:52.961 --> 45:54.587
- Jan, that is
a terrible thing to say.

45:54.629 --> 45:55.839
You apologize to your father.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.590
- Why? It's true.

45:57.632 --> 46:00.093
- We do not need you
to contribute financially.

You are a child.

46:02.679 --> 46:05.473
- You're not going
to Jackson Hole.

46:06.266 --> 46:08.893
- You know, you never let me do
what I want.

46:08.935 --> 46:10.770
You're terrible parents.

46:10.812 --> 46:13.023
You don't care about my dreams.
- Okay, calm down, all right?

46:13.064 --> 46:15.275
- No, you calm down.

46:15.316 --> 46:16.693
