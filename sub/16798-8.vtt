WEBVTT

00:02.541 --> 00:04.485
And polls have officially opened

00:04.486 --> 00:06.526
in what is shaping up to
be one of the most dramatic

00:06.550 --> 00:09.643
American elections in recent memory.

00:09.645 --> 00:12.346
For the first time in nearly 200 years,

00:12.348 --> 00:13.848
we may be looking at a deadlock

00:13.850 --> 00:15.883
in the Electoral College for president.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.452
For more, we'll turn to
our election correspondent,

00:18.454 --> 00:19.520
Robin Carver.

00:19.522 --> 00:20.554
Robin, what would this

00:20.556 --> 00:21.555
three-way tie look like?

00:21.557 --> 00:22.723
Well, Sam Evans

00:22.725 --> 00:24.692
is looking strong and could still win

00:24.694 --> 00:26.627
the outright majority, but if he fails

00:26.629 --> 00:30.531
to reach the magic number
of 270 electoral votes,

00:30.533 --> 00:32.500
then the winner will be chosen

00:32.502 --> 00:33.934
by the House of Representatives,

00:33.936 --> 00:35.336
according to the Twelfth Amendment,

00:35.360 --> 00:36.343
which means that any one

00:36.345 --> 00:38.205
of the top three finishers, including

00:38.207 --> 00:40.574
incumbent Conrad Dalton
and Fred Reynolds,

00:40.576 --> 00:42.042
could still win the election.

00:42.044 --> 00:43.804
And what are the odds of that happening?

00:43.828 --> 00:45.312
I'd say 50-50.

00:45.314 --> 00:46.480
Now, it's all coming down

00:46.482 --> 00:50.684
to a few key swing
states, particularly Ohio.

00:50.686 --> 00:51.852
Is Dalton gonna lose?

00:51.854 --> 00:54.321
I told you, he's not gonna lose.

00:54.323 --> 00:57.791
He just isn't gonna win... today.

00:57.793 --> 00:58.959
But he's totally gonna win

00:58.961 --> 01:00.294
in the House of Representatives
in a couple months.

01:00.296 --> 01:01.829
Which, again, makes no sense.

01:01.831 --> 01:04.131
Well, it's tricky,
but Evans has alienated

01:04.132 --> 01:05.453
a lot of people in his own party,

01:05.477 --> 01:06.867
so in a contingent election,

01:06.869 --> 01:09.069
Dalton should emerge as
the compromise candidate.

01:09.071 --> 01:11.272
And if he doesn't, do I
have to leave Westmore?

01:11.274 --> 01:13.607
Noodle, we've been over this.

01:13.609 --> 01:17.044
No one is moving until
you are safely in college.

01:17.046 --> 01:20.014
Even if we are unemployed.

01:22.384 --> 01:23.951
Is that what you're wearing?

01:23.953 --> 01:25.653
Apparently.

01:25.655 --> 01:28.589
Well, it's just... you
know, Russell Jackson

01:28.591 --> 01:30.524
had requested a blue tie.

01:30.526 --> 01:31.992
You agreed to let him dress me?

01:31.994 --> 01:33.227
The guy was

01:33.229 --> 01:36.063
foaming at the mouth,
ranting about optics.

01:36.065 --> 01:37.531
I just want it to stop.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.158
Hang on, we are unemployed?

01:39.159 --> 01:41.048
I thought Dad's job was safe.

01:41.049 --> 01:42.894
Turns out there's no
tenure at the War College,

01:42.897 --> 01:45.564
so if Evans is elected, my head could be

01:45.566 --> 01:47.499
on the block right next to Mom.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.067
But you know what they say.

01:49.069 --> 01:51.670
Couple that gets fired
together, stays together.

01:51.672 --> 01:52.938
No one says that.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.473
Well, then we better hope Dalton wins.

01:54.475 --> 01:56.174
Or don't.

01:56.176 --> 01:59.444
You know, just in case
you want any real change.

01:59.446 --> 02:00.926
Are you kidding me, Jason?

02:00.950 --> 02:01.747
What is that?

02:01.749 --> 02:03.415
It's exactly what you think it is,

02:03.417 --> 02:04.583
assuming you can read.

02:04.585 --> 02:06.451
Um, I think you missed the part

02:06.453 --> 02:07.519
about how Mom and Dad

02:07.521 --> 02:08.820
could lose their jobs.

02:08.822 --> 02:10.521
No, I got that.

02:10.524 --> 02:11.957
It's just a small price to pay

02:11.959 --> 02:13.558
to defeat the establishment.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.193
Well, as long as it's a small price.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.294
Take it off.

02:16.295 --> 02:18.397
I know everybody's obsessing
over the Twelfth Amendment,

02:18.399 --> 02:19.364
but last time I checked,

02:19.366 --> 02:20.806
I'm still protected under the first.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.434
He cannot wear that to school.

02:22.436 --> 02:23.568
No, he's right.

02:23.570 --> 02:25.090
If Jason genuinely believes

02:25.114 --> 02:27.339
that Reynolds would
make a better president,

02:27.341 --> 02:29.021
I don't have a problem
with him wearing it.

02:29.045 --> 02:29.908
No matter how

02:29.910 --> 02:32.511
obnoxious and disrespectful it may be.

02:32.513 --> 02:33.745
Thank you.

02:33.747 --> 02:35.280
Would be a little bit ironic

02:35.282 --> 02:38.150
if you bought it with our
establishment credit card.

02:38.152 --> 02:40.866
Seriously, Jason?

02:40.867 --> 02:42.287
Come on, when Reynolds gets elected

02:42.289 --> 02:44.256
he's gonna wipe out all
the consumer debt, anyway.

02:44.258 --> 02:45.324
- Student debt.
- Whatever.

02:45.326 --> 02:46.925
- Big difference.
- Russell.

02:46.927 --> 02:48.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're just walking

02:48.391 --> 02:49.891
right out the door now.

02:51.331 --> 02:52.597
So, we're going with that tie?

02:52.599 --> 02:53.632
I'm gonna risk it.

02:53.634 --> 02:55.600
Yeah, you are a brave man, Dr. McCord.

02:55.602 --> 02:57.169
Nah, I'm just a humble,

02:57.171 --> 03:00.305
establishment-supporting coward.

03:00.307 --> 03:02.274
Yes, well, I love you with every ounce

03:02.276 --> 03:04.810
of my cold, plutocratic heart.

03:04.812 --> 03:06.678
Fine, mock me.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.880
We'll see who's laughing
when the revolution comes.

03:16.022 --> 03:18.223
Okay!

03:19.559 --> 03:21.960
For those of you who don't know,

03:21.962 --> 03:25.030
this... is my big board.

03:26.532 --> 03:28.500
Been with me since my first race

03:28.502 --> 03:30.769
for commissioner in Seneca County.

03:30.771 --> 03:33.739
It hasn't let me down yet.

03:35.008 --> 03:37.943
When we started down this road...

03:37.945 --> 03:39.511
some of us...

03:39.513 --> 03:41.580
myself included...

03:41.582 --> 03:44.116
thought winning as an independent...

03:44.118 --> 03:45.417
couldn't be done.

03:45.419 --> 03:48.453
But this board...

03:48.455 --> 03:51.790
this board says we have a shot,

03:51.792 --> 03:53.291
a real shot...

03:53.293 --> 03:55.060
of pulling this thing off...

03:55.062 --> 03:57.829
if... we get to the House

03:57.831 --> 04:00.665
and we can't do that unless we deliver

04:00.667 --> 04:03.869
the great state of
Ohio for Conrad Dalton.

04:03.871 --> 04:07.572
Succeed, and you can
tell your grandchildren

04:07.574 --> 04:09.374
you were a part of history.

04:09.376 --> 04:11.343
Fail...

04:11.345 --> 04:13.945
and you can explain to your
parents how you all got fired.

04:16.516 --> 04:18.183
Let's go!

04:20.087 --> 04:21.620
Don't forget to smile!

04:21.622 --> 04:23.088
That was a blur.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.824
There were so many judges.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.125
Good thing we had a game plan.

04:27.127 --> 04:28.827
Yeah, about that.

04:28.829 --> 04:30.929
I know that we agreed, you know,

04:30.931 --> 04:34.866
Crutchfield for the advisory
neighborhood commission...

04:34.868 --> 04:38.036
but then, you know,
I got in the booth...

04:38.038 --> 04:39.358
- You picked Schneider.
- Me, too.

04:39.382 --> 04:40.739
I know.

04:40.741 --> 04:41.706
Come on, it's...

04:41.708 --> 04:43.241
Thing is...

04:43.243 --> 04:47.913
I just don't want a 19-year-old
zoning our neighborhood.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.595
We could wind up with
a bunch of juice bars

04:49.597 --> 04:50.729
and artisanal vape shops.

04:50.731 --> 04:51.650
And who wants that?

04:51.652 --> 04:52.751
Madam Secretary.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.219
Dr. McCord!

04:54.221 --> 04:56.054
Do you want to make a statement?

04:56.056 --> 04:59.891
Well, this is a
very sacred ritual for us

04:59.893 --> 05:03.128
because we voted on
one of our first dates.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.196
It was very romantic...

05:04.198 --> 05:05.478
and very economical.

05:05.502 --> 05:06.698
Who'd you guys vote for?

05:06.700 --> 05:09.367
Now, Todd, the United
States remains committed

05:09.369 --> 05:11.136
to the principle of the secret ballot.

05:11.138 --> 05:13.105
I voted for Dalton.

05:13.107 --> 05:16.108
Free speech, another
cherished principle.

05:16.110 --> 05:17.476
Thank you, guys.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.026
Madam Secretary, one last question...

05:23.217 --> 05:26.384
Bye, guys.

05:27.186 --> 05:28.653
So, how do you think that went?

05:28.655 --> 05:29.855
Are you kidding?

05:29.857 --> 05:31.457
Even Russell's gonna
be happy about that.

05:32.292 --> 05:34.059
And you got to admit, the tie?

05:34.061 --> 05:35.026
Killed it.

05:35.028 --> 05:36.068
- Yes, it did.
- Killed it.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.590
Not that it's gonna sway the election,

05:37.614 --> 05:38.614
but...

05:39.233 --> 05:41.066
If Sam Evans becomes the next president,

05:41.068 --> 05:44.836
he's gonna take our legacy
apart, piece by piece,

05:44.838 --> 05:47.372
until there's nothing left.

05:47.374 --> 05:49.608
Dalton embraced a new foreign policy

05:49.610 --> 05:50.976
'cause I pushed him.

05:50.978 --> 05:53.411
He ran as an independent,
again, because I pushed him.

05:53.413 --> 05:54.546
It's all on me.

05:54.548 --> 05:55.981
Hey, okay, easy.

05:55.983 --> 05:57.349
You can't blame yourself...

05:57.351 --> 05:58.350
even if Evans wins.

05:58.352 --> 06:00.051
Then who?

06:00.053 --> 06:02.554
Well... the voters.

06:05.691 --> 06:07.292
Wow, I'm just glad our son

06:07.294 --> 06:08.727
isn't old enough to be one of them.

06:08.729 --> 06:10.762
Yeah.

06:10.764 --> 06:11.897
That thing with the T-shirt

06:11.899 --> 06:13.665
seemed to be crossing
a line, even for him.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.933
He's baiting us.

06:14.935 --> 06:16.902
Yeah, it's working.

06:20.541 --> 06:23.275
Walter Nowack wants to see me.

06:23.277 --> 06:24.643
Remember him?

06:24.645 --> 06:27.012
Yeah, the nonproliferation guy.

06:28.548 --> 06:30.115
The last time he got nervous,

06:30.117 --> 06:32.884
a dirty bomb went off in Virginia.

06:34.987 --> 06:36.588
Turns out, Oliver invented

06:36.590 --> 06:38.670
some kind of neural network
they want him to develop.

06:40.427 --> 06:41.793
Did he ask you to go with him?

06:41.795 --> 06:43.495
Begged me, practically.

06:43.497 --> 06:45.163
But I-I said no.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.005
I mean, what am I supposed
to do in California?

06:47.029 --> 06:48.967
Write copy for the next PokÃ©mon Go?

06:48.969 --> 06:51.403
Well, once you get a
taste of the action,

06:51.405 --> 06:53.405
the private sector seems a little dull.

06:55.441 --> 06:58.109
Oliver says he doesn't have
the stomach for long distance,

06:58.111 --> 06:59.411
so we broke up.

06:59.413 --> 07:01.846
I'm sorry.

07:01.848 --> 07:03.408
Of course if I'm out of a job tomorrow,

07:03.432 --> 07:05.483
I'm gonna look pretty foolish.

07:05.485 --> 07:06.952
Well...

07:06.954 --> 07:09.788
in the short term, I suggest alcohol.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.323
Is this your first

07:11.325 --> 07:13.592
presidential election in D.C.?

07:13.594 --> 07:14.626
Yeah, why?

07:16.163 --> 07:17.562
Well, it's a little like.

07:17.564 --> 07:20.765
New Year's Eve and The Hunger Games

07:20.767 --> 07:21.887
rolled into one.

07:21.911 --> 07:22.767
Traditionally,

07:22.769 --> 07:25.036
we veterans gather at the Brickmore

07:25.038 --> 07:28.907
to cope with the agony and the
ecstasy of watching the returns.

07:28.909 --> 07:30.575
Why don't you come with me?

07:30.577 --> 07:32.510
- I'd love to.
- Okay.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.379
Well, good morning, fellow citizens.

07:34.381 --> 07:35.513
Morning.

07:35.515 --> 07:37.782
Morning. We're going to the Brickmore

07:37.784 --> 07:39.651
this evening to watch
the returns come in.

07:39.653 --> 07:41.093
Would you gentlemen care to join us?

07:41.117 --> 07:41.820
The Brickmore?

07:41.822 --> 07:43.255
I was going to hit

07:43.257 --> 07:45.257
the election rave at Tangerine,

07:45.259 --> 07:47.225
but I guess I could kick it old school.

07:47.227 --> 07:48.260
Moran, you in?

07:48.262 --> 07:49.928
I prefer to watch at home where I can

07:49.930 --> 07:52.197
curl into the fetal
position with my blanket.

07:52.199 --> 07:53.898
They have a Steinway.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.867
I'll bring my song book.

07:55.869 --> 07:57.135
Walter Nowack

07:57.137 --> 07:58.503
on the seventh floor.

07:58.505 --> 08:00.338
That guy gives me the creeps.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.439
When he shows up,

08:01.441 --> 08:03.441
doomsday preppers head for the bunker.

08:03.443 --> 08:06.144
Is it too early to start drinking?

08:06.146 --> 08:07.379
Wha...

08:07.381 --> 08:08.480
I'm asking for a friend.

08:08.482 --> 08:11.283
Hassan Karimi, Komeil Yazdani,

08:11.285 --> 08:12.884
Saeid Davaran.

08:12.886 --> 08:14.586
Recognize the names?

08:14.588 --> 08:17.068
They were all top scientists in
Iran's nuclear weapons program.

08:17.092 --> 08:21.793
And all three arrived at Vnukovo
Airport in Moscow last week.

08:21.795 --> 08:25.697
It's the nuclear equivalent of
getting the band back together.

08:28.934 --> 08:31.970
Kurchatov Institute is
near Vnukovo, isn't it?

08:31.972 --> 08:34.972
Less than 80 kilometers.

08:34.975 --> 08:38.076
So, they were either visiting
Russia's top nuclear facility

08:38.078 --> 08:41.446
or they're on a team-building
outing to see Stravinsky

08:41.448 --> 08:43.815
at the Bolshoi.

08:43.817 --> 08:46.985
But assuming they're not ballet fans...

08:46.987 --> 08:48.627
They were advancing
their nuclear program.

08:48.651 --> 08:51.790
Which is a direct violation of our deal.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.927
Is anybody else
traveling with these guys?

08:55.929 --> 08:58.029
Not on that flight, but
we could expand the search,

08:58.031 --> 08:59.364
look at old manifests.

08:59.366 --> 09:01.566
Do it.

09:03.102 --> 09:04.736
But this stays between the three of us.

09:04.738 --> 09:07.272
Send whatever you find directly to me.

09:07.274 --> 09:09.040
There's still a chance
we could be wrong.

09:09.042 --> 09:12.310
Unless there's corroborating evidence,

09:12.312 --> 09:14.679
we're going with a night at the ballet.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:25.151 --> 09:26.391
This is your 15 minute warning.

09:26.393 --> 09:27.459
Thanks.

09:27.461 --> 09:29.060
You can't be late for the Dalton event.

09:29.062 --> 09:30.295
Do I have to go?

09:30.297 --> 09:32.464
Yes, Russell Jackson
made that clear at length

09:32.466 --> 09:33.531
and at a very high volume.

09:33.533 --> 09:36.234
Also, Walter and Jay
sent this up for you.

09:38.504 --> 09:41.072
Have any of the networks
called anything yet?

09:41.074 --> 09:42.540
Not yet,

09:42.542 --> 09:44.542
but polls should be
closing in a few minutes.

09:48.114 --> 09:50.148
Should I tell Mr. Jackson
you're on your way?

09:50.150 --> 09:51.616
Koohyar Nazari.

09:51.618 --> 09:53.284
No.

09:53.286 --> 09:54.786
Wait.

09:54.788 --> 09:55.854
Shoes!

09:57.824 --> 09:58.857
Ma'am, there's...

09:58.859 --> 10:00.625
Thank you so much.

10:00.627 --> 10:02.560
Madam Secretary.

10:02.562 --> 10:03.562
- Madam Secretary.
- Yeah.

10:03.586 --> 10:04.696
Secretary McCord.

10:04.698 --> 10:06.218
- Madam Secretary.
- Hey, Bruce.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.900
That was an excellent
round table on Haiti.

10:07.924 --> 10:08.433
Well done.

10:08.435 --> 10:10.235
Hi, guys. So sorry.

10:10.237 --> 10:11.858
- Hold on, Madam Secretary.
- Hey, Sheila.

10:11.859 --> 10:12.620
How's the parakeet?

10:12.622 --> 10:14.262
Madam Secretary, how
ever did you find us?

10:14.286 --> 10:16.408
Those guys weren't going to the ballet.

10:16.410 --> 10:17.809
They were shopping.

10:17.811 --> 10:20.445
There's an Iranian banker on this list.

10:20.447 --> 10:22.180
- How did we miss that?
- No, it-it's...

10:22.182 --> 10:24.482
I only know the name
from my time at CIA.

10:24.484 --> 10:25.617
Koohyar Nazari.

10:25.619 --> 10:26.785
Now, on the books,

10:26.787 --> 10:29.287
he's listed as a manager
of a lumber company.

10:29.289 --> 10:33.892
He secretly works as a loan
officer at Razmian Bank.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.161
Which the Iranian government
uses to make illicit deals.

10:36.163 --> 10:39.230
Nazari arrived two days
before the scientists.

10:39.232 --> 10:41.132
I mean, a guy like that only shows up

10:41.134 --> 10:42.634
when there is a massive purchase

10:42.636 --> 10:43.768
about to take place.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.904
There's your corroborating
evidence right there.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.105
But what are they buying?

10:47.107 --> 10:48.173
Well, there can only be

10:48.175 --> 10:51.509
one logical answer to that question.

10:51.511 --> 10:56.147
Vasily Heavy Industries
has a plant right here.

10:56.149 --> 10:57.982
I'm guessing they don't make toasters.

10:57.984 --> 11:00.452
Actually, they do. But they also hold

11:00.454 --> 11:04.489
an exclusive contract
to build centrifuges

11:04.491 --> 11:07.392
for Russia's nuclear weapons program.

11:07.394 --> 11:10.228
If the Russians are supplying
Iran with centrifuges,

11:10.230 --> 11:12.430
they'll achieve breakout
capacity in a matter of months.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.199
Okay, we need to track every shipment

11:14.201 --> 11:17.035
out of that facility
within the last week.

11:20.974 --> 11:24.008
Jeez, it's like Comic-Con in here.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.370
I don't get your reference,

11:25.394 --> 11:27.245
but I do get the claustrophobia.

11:27.247 --> 11:29.481
Well, just close your
eyes and think of Gershwin.

11:31.017 --> 11:34.385
Sorry, Mattman.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.523
So, who wants shots?

11:38.525 --> 11:40.925
Me, me. A thousand times me.

11:40.927 --> 11:43.161
Shots...

11:43.163 --> 11:44.729
- Well, that was weird.
- What was?

11:44.731 --> 11:47.332
The tie adjustment, the old nickname.

11:47.334 --> 11:48.967
I'd swear she was putting
out the old Matt-signal.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.068
Well, it's possible.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.836
She did just break up with Oliver.

11:51.838 --> 11:53.204
Whoa, she's single again?

11:53.206 --> 11:54.572
Easy, Mattman.

11:54.574 --> 11:55.640
Fireballs.

11:55.642 --> 11:57.742
If we're going down,

11:57.744 --> 12:00.011
at least we're going down in flames.

12:00.013 --> 12:01.112
I will drink to that.

12:01.114 --> 12:02.146
Just one second.

12:02.148 --> 12:03.381
I'd like to make a toast.

12:03.383 --> 12:06.985
Should this be my last administration,

12:06.987 --> 12:09.454
I'd just like to say
that working with you all

12:09.456 --> 12:12.624
has been... a real pleasure.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.127
Cheers.

12:20.099 --> 12:22.333
Bess, what do we have?

12:22.335 --> 12:25.770
The Russian vessel is the
SS Kazym, out of Vladivostok.

12:25.772 --> 12:29.340
Officially, she's got a
cargo of wheat and barley.

12:29.342 --> 12:31.776
Unofficially, my team
has reason to believe

12:31.778 --> 12:33.478
that she is carrying a shipment

12:33.480 --> 12:35.580
of gas centrifuges to Iran.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.549
Do you really think Iran
is breaking our deal?

12:37.551 --> 12:38.917
Sure looks that way.

12:38.919 --> 12:40.184
Where is she now?

12:40.186 --> 12:41.920
Gulf of Oman.

12:41.922 --> 12:43.755
Traveling ten knots on a course

12:43.757 --> 12:47.058
for the Iranian port of Bander Abbas.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.627
She's going to enter
Iranian territorial waters

12:49.629 --> 12:51.095
in less than two hours.

12:51.097 --> 12:52.463
Can we intercept?

12:52.465 --> 12:54.399
We have a destroyer in range,

12:54.401 --> 12:56.634
but the window's narrow,
and it is closing fast.

12:56.636 --> 12:59.804
Do we have any hard proof that
they're carrying contraband?

12:59.806 --> 13:01.239
For now it's circumstantial.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.308
The proof is in the hold.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.910
If we come up empty, we could be looking

13:04.934 --> 13:06.611
at a major embarrassment.

13:06.613 --> 13:08.546
So you want to just let 'em go?

13:08.548 --> 13:11.549
Our coalition is hanging by a thread.

13:11.551 --> 13:13.351
I've planned for a lot of contingencies,

13:13.353 --> 13:16.220
but taking a wrecking ball to
the Iran deal isn't one of them.

13:16.222 --> 13:18.302
Not to mention what this
might do to our relationship

13:18.326 --> 13:19.824
- with Russia.
- Yeah, it I'm wrong,

13:19.826 --> 13:22.226
we would be embarrassed.

13:22.228 --> 13:24.295
But if I'm right, and we do nothing...

13:24.297 --> 13:27.999
The Iranians will be
at breakout capacity.

13:28.001 --> 13:30.935
Call in the Joint Chiefs.
We're stopping that ship.

13:51.321 --> 13:52.521
The last thing I want to do is

13:52.545 --> 13:54.388
take advantage of a vulnerable person.

13:57.860 --> 13:59.994
Look at me.

13:59.996 --> 14:01.696
I'm vulnerable, too.

14:01.698 --> 14:07.001
I mean, was it the best sex ever?

14:07.003 --> 14:08.936
Yeah.

14:08.938 --> 14:11.405
Was that enough? Guess not.

14:13.575 --> 14:14.775
What do you think?

14:15.711 --> 14:17.645
"Shall I part my hair behind?

14:17.647 --> 14:20.247
Do I dare to eat a peach."

14:21.817 --> 14:24.652
I don't think anyone ever
got laid quoting Prufrock.

14:24.654 --> 14:26.654
What up, nerds?

14:26.656 --> 14:28.022
Matt, you know Win.

14:28.024 --> 14:29.690
I believe you two are what the kids call.

14:29.692 --> 14:30.758
"Eskimo Brothers"

14:30.760 --> 14:33.060
Matty man, it's good to see you.

14:33.062 --> 14:35.162
Mutual, I'm sure.

14:35.164 --> 14:36.964
Since when do you two work together?

14:36.966 --> 14:38.733
Ever since legal marijuana became

14:38.735 --> 14:41.335
a bizillion-dollar industry.

14:41.337 --> 14:42.703
Can I buy you guys a drink?

14:42.705 --> 14:43.938
I don't think so.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.540
Actually, I'd be delighted.

14:48.177 --> 14:49.844
Yes, Max, I agree.

14:49.846 --> 14:51.746
Invasive species are a
menace to the Everglades.

14:51.748 --> 14:53.547
That's why I'm the only candidate

14:53.549 --> 14:56.651
with a comprehensive
plan to tackle them.

14:56.653 --> 15:00.121
And, yes, that includes
additional funding, so...

15:00.123 --> 15:01.756
do I have your support?

15:04.426 --> 15:06.460
I'll take it.

15:08.964 --> 15:10.231
Rexford's a maybe.

15:10.233 --> 15:14.201
Okay. You've got Kripke next,

15:14.203 --> 15:17.238
followed by Simonson.

15:19.307 --> 15:21.042
Yeah?

15:22.110 --> 15:23.944
It's happening.

15:29.485 --> 15:31.252
We're hailing them, Mr. President.

15:31.254 --> 15:32.694
Vessel Kazym, repeat,

15:32.718 --> 15:34.689
this is the U.S. Navy Destroyer Pico.

15:34.691 --> 15:37.925
Heave to and prepare to be boarded.

15:39.594 --> 15:41.095
Fire a warning shot.

15:41.097 --> 15:44.031
Captain, put one across her bow.

15:49.538 --> 15:50.971
No response, sir.

15:50.973 --> 15:52.216
They're making a run for it.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.916
How long till they reach Iranian waters?

15:53.918 --> 15:55.007
T-minus five minutes.

15:55.008 --> 15:56.901
Sir, I'm getting multiple
contacts approaching the Pico.

15:56.902 --> 15:58.888
Iranian fast-attack craft.
They're closing quickly.

15:58.890 --> 16:00.370
Looks like someone called for backup.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.098
Are the Iranians crazy
enough to attack us?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.659
Not in international waters.

16:03.661 --> 16:06.462
The moment our destroyer
crosses the line...

16:06.464 --> 16:08.497
They'll be all over us. Options?

16:08.499 --> 16:11.234
Sir, the Pico has a platoon
of Marines in two raiding craft

16:11.236 --> 16:12.335
on standby.

16:12.337 --> 16:15.071
If we act now, we can
capture the Russian ship

16:15.073 --> 16:16.606
before it reaches Iranian waters.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.341
Do it.

16:18.343 --> 16:19.942
Charlie, Echo, you're clear to board.

16:26.617 --> 16:29.085
Hostiles still inbound.
Visual contact in two minutes.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.153
You better be right about this.

16:43.801 --> 16:46.168
Drop your weapon!

16:46.170 --> 16:51.807
Please tell me we didn't
just kill Russian sailors.

16:51.809 --> 16:53.409
What about the Iranians?

16:53.411 --> 16:55.371
Their ships are turning.
They're bugging our, sir.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.962
We have eyes on the package.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.220
Stand back.

17:06.123 --> 17:07.690
Admiral, can we get a closer look?

17:07.692 --> 17:09.858
Stand by. Get close, Echo.

17:18.702 --> 17:21.470
I'm guessing that's not a Crockpot.

17:21.472 --> 17:23.071
It's a centrifuge.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.910
The media's gonna have
a field day with this.

17:27.912 --> 17:30.613
We're gonna lose. It's over.

17:30.615 --> 17:32.615
You don't know that.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.250
I spent months...

17:34.252 --> 17:37.219
trying to build a coalition...

17:37.221 --> 17:40.189
all on the strength of two things...

17:40.191 --> 17:41.991
our nuclear deal with Iran,

17:41.993 --> 17:43.826
and dÃ©tente with Russia.

17:43.828 --> 17:45.061
And thanks to Pandora here,

17:45.063 --> 17:48.864
we just lost both in
the span of five minutes.

17:48.866 --> 17:50.266
It was the right call.

17:50.268 --> 17:52.702
Of course.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.571
I'm just trying to get my head around

17:55.573 --> 17:57.039
electoral Armageddon.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.475
The question is how close is Iran

17:59.477 --> 18:00.576
to getting the bomb?

18:00.578 --> 18:02.411
The Navy impounded the centrifuges.

18:02.413 --> 18:05.181
There's a chance we stopped
them in their tracks.

18:05.183 --> 18:07.183
Or it's just the tip of the iceberg.

18:07.185 --> 18:08.505
There's only one way to find out.

18:08.529 --> 18:10.619
Trigger Article 63 of the deal.

18:10.621 --> 18:13.723
If Iran commits a violation,

18:13.725 --> 18:15.758
the U.N. Security Council has the right

18:15.760 --> 18:18.160
to send in IAEA inspectors.

18:18.162 --> 18:20.963
So if Iran cooperates with
the inspectors and comes clean,

18:20.965 --> 18:23.332
we could put the genie
back in the bottle.

18:23.334 --> 18:24.400
In theory, yeah.

18:24.402 --> 18:27.136
In theory, I'm eligible to be Pope.

18:27.138 --> 18:31.207
Other than being
married and not Catholic.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.743
Aren't you forgetting something?

18:33.745 --> 18:36.812
Russia holds a veto in
the Security Council.

18:36.814 --> 18:39.148
And a grudge,

18:39.150 --> 18:40.837
now that we killed two of their sailors.

18:40.838 --> 18:42.678
Yeah, they'll never allow
inspections, not now.

18:42.679 --> 18:44.080
We have the centrifuges.

18:44.104 --> 18:46.889
The evidence of a
violation is undeniable.

18:46.891 --> 18:49.992
It's never stopped 'em before.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.865
They're getting ready to call Ohio.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.449
Citizens United was
a ringing endorsement

19:05.450 --> 19:07.182
for American liberty.

19:07.184 --> 19:09.685
Said the Dark Prince of K Street.

19:09.687 --> 19:11.387
You only think money is speech

19:11.389 --> 19:12.521
because it's paying you.

19:12.523 --> 19:14.957
- Money is America, Nadine.
- My God.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.825
The only reason that
the colonist revolted

19:16.827 --> 19:18.547
is because the king
told them to buy stamps.

19:18.571 --> 19:21.630
I know it didn't last long,

19:21.632 --> 19:24.033
but it meant a lot, you know?

19:24.035 --> 19:26.635
No, no, man, I get you.

19:26.637 --> 19:28.537
She has that effect on people.

19:28.539 --> 19:31.273
When she turns those big
eyes on you, it's totally...

19:31.275 --> 19:33.976
Sublime! It's like two black opals

19:33.978 --> 19:35.778
staring straight into your soul.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.481
Yeah, I was going with "hot," but sure.

19:39.483 --> 19:41.884
Hey, a word of advice, though?

19:42.887 --> 19:45.521
Hooking up with your ex is bad news.

19:45.523 --> 19:48.090
Especially if you've
still got feelings for her.

19:48.092 --> 19:50.959
You're probably right.

19:50.961 --> 19:51.994
Thanks, man.

19:51.996 --> 19:54.129
Anytime, bud.

19:54.131 --> 19:55.764
Great chat.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.704
And it looks like we are finally ready

20:01.706 --> 20:03.439
- to make a projection in Ohio.
- Shh!

20:03.441 --> 20:06.975
As we all know, if Dalton
loses here, his race is over.

20:06.977 --> 20:09.177
But if he manages a victory,
the election will be thrown

20:09.201 --> 20:12.614
to the House of Representatives.

20:12.616 --> 20:14.650
We are calling Ohio for Conrad Dalton.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.142
Deadlock in the
Electoral College since 1824.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.124
My goodness!

20:22.126 --> 20:25.094
On January 6th, the
House of Representatives

20:25.096 --> 20:26.528
will choose our next president.

20:26.530 --> 20:28.230
We're entering uncharted waters...

20:28.232 --> 20:31.166
Out of the frying pan...

20:31.168 --> 20:33.435
into the House.

20:43.646 --> 20:45.047
Told you.

20:45.049 --> 20:46.381
Hey, you seen Daisy?

20:46.383 --> 20:48.283
We won, baby!

20:48.285 --> 20:49.885
Easy, boy, it's just Ohio.

20:49.887 --> 20:53.288
Yeah, we didn't lose.
It's going to the House!

21:20.751 --> 21:23.519
Two of my Russian countrymen
are dead and you give me regret?

21:23.521 --> 21:25.988
Our Marines acted in self-defense.

21:25.990 --> 21:28.123
After illegally boarding our ship.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.758
It was a by the book search and seizure.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.726
No.

21:30.728 --> 21:33.095
You had no right to seize the Kazym.

21:33.097 --> 21:34.963
These were taken in the cargo hold,

21:34.965 --> 21:37.332
hidden in a container of wheat.

21:37.334 --> 21:40.002
High-frequency gas centrifuges,
used to enrich uranium.

21:40.004 --> 21:42.004
What exactly are you implying?

21:42.006 --> 21:43.872
Nothing. I'm stating a fact.

21:43.874 --> 21:48.422
The Kazym was involved in a
deliberate attempt to circumvent

21:48.423 --> 21:50.712
the terms of our nuclear deal with Iran.

21:50.714 --> 21:52.631
You need to support our vote

21:52.632 --> 21:54.532
to send inspectors into Iran.

21:54.534 --> 21:56.834
I see only lies.

21:56.836 --> 21:59.137
Conjured by your CIA to
justify another invasion

21:59.139 --> 22:00.476
- of the Middle East.
- Really?

22:00.477 --> 22:03.017
- You're going with conspiracy theory?
- I remember well

22:03.018 --> 22:05.018
your aluminum tubes and yellowcake

22:05.020 --> 22:06.386
before the invasion of Iraq.

22:06.387 --> 22:08.420
Alexei, talk to me.

22:08.422 --> 22:10.188
What the hell is going on?

22:10.190 --> 22:11.490
The United States

22:11.492 --> 22:15.360
will pay for what it has done to us.

22:21.726 --> 22:23.006
This appeasement,

22:23.008 --> 22:25.597
This cowardice of the
Dalton administration...

22:25.598 --> 22:26.827
You're up early.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.197
I was gonna go for a
run, but I got distracted

22:29.198 --> 22:31.163
by this blowhard.

22:31.165 --> 22:32.965
The Iran deal and order

22:32.967 --> 22:34.887
an immediate military
buildup in the Middle East.

22:34.911 --> 22:37.737
On January 6th, the citizens...

22:37.739 --> 22:39.972
That's comforting.

22:39.974 --> 22:43.576
Well, don't mean to pile
on, but guess who's going

22:43.578 --> 22:46.479
to the Reynolds' rally at
RFK Stadium this afternoon?

22:46.481 --> 22:48.180
Jason.

22:48.182 --> 22:49.315
Yep.

22:49.317 --> 22:52.652
That's disappointing.

22:52.654 --> 22:56.222
Although we have given
him a lot to rebel against.

22:56.224 --> 22:57.757
How is that, exactly?

22:57.759 --> 23:00.626
They've lost their
right to a normal life.

23:00.628 --> 23:03.529
I don't want to take away
their right to react to it.

23:03.531 --> 23:06.632
So their extremely privileged
life isn't exactly normal.

23:06.634 --> 23:09.302
That doesn't give him
the license to be smug.

23:09.304 --> 23:14.173
Which he really was, when he
announced this to me last night.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.375
I wanted to shut him down, but...

23:16.377 --> 23:18.377
after the whole T-shirt thing, I...

23:18.379 --> 23:20.279
Slippery slope.

23:22.115 --> 23:25.551
Iran's Supreme Council just
issued a blanket statement,

23:25.553 --> 23:30.089
insisting that the centrifuges
were intended for civilian use.

23:30.091 --> 23:31.357
Ha.

23:31.359 --> 23:33.326
Yeah, high-frequency
centrifuge would mix up

23:33.328 --> 23:34.994
a hell of a salad dressing.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.662
Well, at least they're not like Russia,

23:36.664 --> 23:39.699
going with paranoid conspiracy theory.

23:39.701 --> 23:42.034
Doesn't that reek of desperation?

23:42.036 --> 23:44.770
Well, yeah, it's a little stinky,

23:44.772 --> 23:47.206
but they got caught with their hand

23:47.208 --> 23:49.575
in the nuclear... cookie jar.

23:49.577 --> 23:51.377
Yeah, I'm-I'm just saying,

23:51.379 --> 23:53.479
if Russia really wanted to
give Iran nuclear weapons,

23:53.481 --> 23:55.281
wouldn't they have been ready

23:55.305 --> 23:58.217
with a more plausible cover story?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.251
Just saying.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.050
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.494
Nadine, can you please
get me Walter Nowack

24:15.497 --> 24:17.530
in my office ASAP?

24:17.532 --> 24:18.965
I want him to scour everything

24:18.967 --> 24:21.534
we've got on Vasily Heavy Industries.

24:21.536 --> 24:22.802
Yes, Ma'am.

24:22.804 --> 24:24.003
Get right on that.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.272
Did you get a dog?

24:28.276 --> 24:30.443
No, ma'am, I'm pet sitting.

24:30.445 --> 24:31.697
Okay, bye now.

24:36.483 --> 24:38.766
So... waffles?

24:41.590 --> 24:43.890
Can you turn the air on?

24:43.892 --> 24:44.958
You feel that suspension?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.426
What I feel is nauseous.

24:46.428 --> 24:47.393
You can grab a Red Bull

24:47.395 --> 24:48.695
from the glove box.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.729
Last night was amazing.

24:49.731 --> 24:52.632
Just... make a left turn right here.

24:58.739 --> 25:00.673
And you're right,

25:00.675 --> 25:02.442
it was end-of-the-world sex.

25:02.444 --> 25:04.010
'Cause I didn't know if

25:04.012 --> 25:05.712
I'd have a job in the morning.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.580
Guess I still don't know.

25:07.582 --> 25:09.215
Just don't expect it to happen again.

25:09.217 --> 25:13.152
I won't.

25:13.154 --> 25:14.787
No?

25:15.656 --> 25:17.709
What happens on election night,

25:17.710 --> 25:19.341
stays on election night.

25:29.018 --> 25:31.178
It seems your suspicions
regarding the Russians

25:31.202 --> 25:32.375
were on point, ma'am.

25:32.377 --> 25:34.577
Three Vasily Heavy Industries
officials were disappeared

25:34.601 --> 25:36.078
by the FSB last night.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.947
The C.O.O., the VP of logistics,

25:37.949 --> 25:39.348
and the chief engineer

25:39.350 --> 25:40.616
of the centrifuge program.

25:40.618 --> 25:41.851
That's great.

25:41.853 --> 25:44.503
Wait, so a bunch of
dudes are disappeared

25:44.504 --> 25:46.703
without due process in
an authoritarian state

25:46.705 --> 25:47.704
and that's great?

25:47.706 --> 25:49.146
It means that the Russian Government

25:49.170 --> 25:50.674
didn't authorize the shipment.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.243
It was a rogue operation,
through and through.

25:53.245 --> 25:56.146
But if the Russians are willing
to prosecute their own people,

25:56.148 --> 25:58.615
why won't they come
clean about what happened?

25:58.617 --> 26:00.697
Probably because what
happened is super embarrassing.

26:00.699 --> 26:02.059
And it's hard to save face

26:02.083 --> 26:03.520
after the fact.

26:03.522 --> 26:04.522
Tell me about it.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.560
I may have a way for them to save face.

26:10.562 --> 26:12.362
Blake!

26:12.364 --> 26:14.765
Keep me posted. Thanks.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.366
Elizabeth?

26:16.368 --> 26:18.735
She's making another
run at the Russians.

26:18.737 --> 26:20.637
Well, she better hurry.

26:20.639 --> 26:23.106
This whole debacle is driving
a stake through the heart

26:23.108 --> 26:24.775
of our coalition.

26:24.777 --> 26:28.612
The delegations from
Iowa, Utah and Virginia

26:28.614 --> 26:30.647
just flipped to Evans.

26:30.649 --> 26:32.616
That was fast.

26:32.618 --> 26:34.017
Yeah, and only the beginning.

26:34.019 --> 26:39.589
Nebraska and Colorado are
now in the maybe column.

26:40.659 --> 26:42.692
Sam Evans isn't just
stealing our friends.

26:42.694 --> 26:46.630
He's snatching our lunch money
and kissing our girlfriends.

26:46.632 --> 26:49.065
If the House voted today, he'd win.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.737
So how do we take down the bully?

26:58.377 --> 27:00.644
By making common cause with his enemy.

27:00.646 --> 27:02.045
Fred Reynolds.

27:02.047 --> 27:06.650
Reynolds only secured the
electoral votes in nine states,

27:06.652 --> 27:09.186
which means he doesn't have a
shot at winning in the House.

27:09.188 --> 27:11.855
But he does have the
power to play kingmaker.

27:11.857 --> 27:14.024
We get his endorsement,

27:14.026 --> 27:16.593
we can hit 26 states
without breaking a sweat.

27:16.595 --> 27:17.694
That's a big if.

27:17.696 --> 27:19.629
Reynolds wants to hike
the marginal tax rate

27:19.631 --> 27:22.332
to levels we haven't
seen since World War II.

27:22.334 --> 27:24.301
He hates virtually
everything I stand for.

27:24.303 --> 27:25.869
Well...

27:25.871 --> 27:29.072
let's hope he hates Sam Evans more.

27:30.975 --> 27:32.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:32.377 --> 27:34.544
- How was the rally?
- It was awesome.

27:34.546 --> 27:36.446
Yeah, I saw. On your profile.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.548
This is Jason McCord for the Revolution.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.183
Now I pledge to support Fred Reynolds

27:40.185 --> 27:41.218
because I believe that...

27:42.487 --> 27:44.354
He is fighting for real change.

27:45.924 --> 27:48.158
He is the-the only candidate
who thinks billionaires

27:48.160 --> 27:50.260
should pay their fair share in taxes.

27:51.630 --> 27:54.297
Sit on the sidelines
while so-called wise men

27:54.299 --> 27:55.632
allow the status quo to grow

27:55.634 --> 27:57.367
like a cancer on our future.

27:58.871 --> 28:01.071
Take it down.

28:01.073 --> 28:02.739
Now.

28:02.741 --> 28:04.674
Why?

28:04.676 --> 28:07.010
Do I really have to
spell it out for you?

28:10.481 --> 28:11.481
Fine.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.883
- Are we done?
- No.

28:12.885 --> 28:15.385
Let's say Reynolds does
become president, what then?

28:15.387 --> 28:17.654
Then he's president.

28:17.656 --> 28:21.124
And what's his position
on... for example, Iran?

28:21.126 --> 28:23.126
He wants every country to
control its own destiny.

28:23.128 --> 28:24.995
What's that mean exactly?

28:24.997 --> 28:27.230
Self-determination.

28:27.232 --> 28:31.735
So, if Iran is self-determined
to acquire nuclear weapons,

28:31.737 --> 28:34.704
does Reynolds think we should let them?

28:34.706 --> 28:36.706
- Do you?
- No!

28:36.708 --> 28:40.343
No, I...

28:40.345 --> 28:41.511
I'm not sure.

28:41.513 --> 28:42.779
And yet you're sure that

28:42.781 --> 28:45.081
he would make a better president.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.716
What's-what's your point?

28:46.718 --> 28:48.558
Your knowledge is a mile
wide and an inch deep.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.840
Do you know what that makes you?

28:49.864 --> 28:50.987
A poser.

28:50.989 --> 28:52.022
A dilettante.

28:52.024 --> 28:54.224
If you're gonna support someone,

28:54.226 --> 28:56.660
and publicly humiliate your
own family in the process,

28:56.662 --> 28:59.029
then you damn well better
be able to defend him.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.398
So either educate yourself,

29:01.400 --> 29:03.566
or stop talking.

29:08.706 --> 29:10.774
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

29:10.776 --> 29:12.943
The status quo has got to go!

29:12.945 --> 29:14.477
Hey, hey!

29:33.597 --> 29:36.032
Fred.

29:36.034 --> 29:38.001
Thanks for seeing us.

29:38.003 --> 29:39.269
Mr. President.

29:39.271 --> 29:40.437
Russell.

29:40.439 --> 29:43.039
I could have done without
the cloak and dagger.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.911
You've...

29:47.913 --> 29:49.946
you've fought a hell of a campaign.

29:49.948 --> 29:51.648
Inspired millions.

29:51.650 --> 29:54.017
Even I was getting a little misty-eyed

29:54.019 --> 29:55.819
at some of your speeches.

29:55.821 --> 29:57.520
But now it's time to unite.

29:57.522 --> 29:59.723
The stock market is crashing.

29:59.725 --> 30:02.559
Our enemies abroad
smell blood in the water.

30:02.561 --> 30:04.861
The American people need certainty.

30:04.863 --> 30:06.563
And I'm happy to provide it.

30:06.565 --> 30:08.198
Assuming we can work together.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.400
School reform has been the cornerstone

30:10.402 --> 30:12.268
of your agenda.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.603
And it's an area where you and I

30:13.605 --> 30:14.804
are in lockstep.

30:14.806 --> 30:16.139
Now,

30:16.141 --> 30:20.243
I'm prepared to offer you
the Department of Education,

30:20.245 --> 30:23.780
along with a mandate to
run it as you see fit.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.318
I think our people got
their wires crossed.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.953
I was under the impression

30:29.955 --> 30:32.088
that you were going
to offer to endorse me.

30:32.090 --> 30:33.790
You can't be serious.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.125
Your support is disintegrating.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.894
The whole Iran debacle
exposes why the next president

30:37.896 --> 30:39.963
should focus on our
problems here at home.

30:39.965 --> 30:41.831
Senator, the numbers don't lie.

30:41.833 --> 30:45.268
The only statistical certainty
in this whole election

30:45.270 --> 30:46.669
is that you're gonna lose.

30:46.671 --> 30:48.391
It's like betting on
last year's Super Bowl.

30:48.415 --> 30:51.216
And Evans will destroy
everything you stand for.

30:52.977 --> 30:55.378
I'm fighting for the
millions of voiceless people

30:55.380 --> 30:58.148
who can't afford four more
years of cynical compromise

30:58.150 --> 30:59.482
in Washington.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.084
I'm taking this to the finish line.

31:01.086 --> 31:03.086
Sir.

31:03.088 --> 31:04.654
Russell.

31:20.267 --> 31:24.437
We know about the arrests
at Vasily Heavy Industries.

31:24.439 --> 31:26.372
What of it?

31:26.374 --> 31:30.009
And we know that the Russian
government had nothing to do

31:30.011 --> 31:32.378
with the shipment of those centrifuges.

31:32.380 --> 31:35.548
What do you want?

31:35.550 --> 31:38.284
Your country has a scandal on its hands,

31:38.286 --> 31:40.453
and I can give you a way out.

31:41.288 --> 31:43.122
I'm listening.

31:43.124 --> 31:44.323
We're prepared to say that

31:44.325 --> 31:47.293
the raid on the Kazym
was a joint operation,

31:47.295 --> 31:50.096
coordinated by Russian Intelligence.

31:50.098 --> 31:52.231
Our CIA will provide
the necessary documents

31:52.233 --> 31:53.599
to back it up.

31:54.468 --> 31:57.269
The men who were killed...

31:57.271 --> 31:58.838
their families will need compensation.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.641
They could be entitled
to a condolence payment.

32:01.643 --> 32:05.144
We genuinely regret the loss of life.

32:08.248 --> 32:11.050
None of this happens, however,

32:11.052 --> 32:13.419
unless Russia drops the veto threat

32:13.421 --> 32:17.490
and allows IAEA inspections
of Iran's nuclear sites.

32:21.428 --> 32:24.030
I'll take this to President Salnikov.

32:38.612 --> 32:40.112
Russell?

32:40.114 --> 32:42.081
How'd it go with Zinchenko?

32:42.083 --> 32:45.885
Fine. I was gonna call you.

32:45.887 --> 32:46.852
No, never mind that.

32:46.854 --> 32:48.721
This is about something else.

32:49.656 --> 32:52.291
Mike B. Is making an
end-run around Reynolds

32:52.293 --> 32:54.193
to reach his supporters.

32:54.195 --> 32:57.163
I want you to go as backup.

32:57.165 --> 32:58.998
Any particular reason?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.266
Well, I'd do it myself,

33:00.268 --> 33:03.202
but they're all skittish
about this Iran situation.

33:03.204 --> 33:05.137
I need a credible
figure to talk them down.

33:05.139 --> 33:09.241
Besides, if I'm in a
room full of pacifists,

33:09.243 --> 33:10.643
there's no telling what I might do.

33:10.667 --> 33:11.884
I have to clear my schedule...

33:11.886 --> 33:13.379
It's already done.

33:15.649 --> 33:18.050
So, I have a total of
eight suits in there,

33:18.052 --> 33:20.786
representing key districts
in Florida, Maine and Georgia.

33:20.788 --> 33:22.455
Any one of them could flip their state

33:22.457 --> 33:23.989
to Dalton in the House,

33:23.991 --> 33:25.558
but the real heavy is Elle Vazquez,

33:25.560 --> 33:27.460
who sits on a Foreign Affairs Committee.

33:27.462 --> 33:29.361
Take her out and the rest will follow.

33:29.363 --> 33:30.730
- Okay.
- Happy hunting.

33:30.732 --> 33:31.812
Wait, before I go in there,

33:31.836 --> 33:33.733
I got to know.

33:33.735 --> 33:36.035
Did you and my chief of staff...

33:36.037 --> 33:37.670
A gentleman never tells.

33:37.672 --> 33:39.538
Yes.

33:43.009 --> 33:45.511
No one in this room
likes Governor Evans.

33:45.513 --> 33:47.446
But each of us made a
pledge to Fred Reynolds.

33:47.448 --> 33:48.647
You're asking us

33:48.649 --> 33:52.184
to abandon a man who's inspired millions

33:52.186 --> 33:53.252
of our constituents.

33:53.254 --> 33:55.221
So how do we get on the same page?

33:55.223 --> 33:56.743
If there's one thing we can't stomach,

33:56.767 --> 33:58.457
it's another war in the Middle East.

33:58.459 --> 34:00.392
Evans is practically chomping at the bit

34:00.394 --> 34:01.494
to invade Iran.

34:01.496 --> 34:04.296
We need your pledge that Dalton won't.

34:04.298 --> 34:06.232
Under any circumstance.

34:09.335 --> 34:13.672
Believe me, nobody put more
at risk for the Iran deal

34:13.674 --> 34:15.940
than Dalton. You have my word

34:15.943 --> 34:17.909
that I will never give up,

34:17.911 --> 34:20.646
as long as there's a
sliver of a possibility

34:20.648 --> 34:22.148
that we can save it.

34:24.317 --> 34:26.118
But I can't, in good conscience,

34:26.120 --> 34:29.722
make that pledge.

34:29.724 --> 34:31.623
If Iran won't accept our inspections,

34:31.626 --> 34:33.458
we may not have a choice.

34:35.195 --> 34:37.797
The House doesn't vote...

34:37.799 --> 34:40.132
until January 6.

34:40.134 --> 34:42.768
If you can resolve this
Iran issue peacefully

34:42.770 --> 34:45.070
before then, we'll switch to Dalton.

34:45.072 --> 34:46.205
Otherwise,

34:46.206 --> 34:48.274
we'll take our chances with Reynolds.

34:51.945 --> 34:53.712
I will support Reynolds

34:53.714 --> 34:55.447
and I will fight the old establishment

34:55.449 --> 34:56.849
of Evans and Dalton

34:56.851 --> 34:59.318
until we get the
government that we deserve!

34:59.320 --> 35:01.187
Yeah!

35:01.189 --> 35:02.988
Well, at least he finally thinks

35:02.990 --> 35:04.523
government should exist.

35:05.693 --> 35:06.725
He took it down,

35:06.727 --> 35:08.394
but not before it got thousands of hits.

35:08.396 --> 35:11.130
We're lucky it's not blasting on CNN.

35:11.965 --> 35:13.299
Between the electoral chaos

35:13.301 --> 35:15.334
and Iran getting close to the bomb,

35:15.336 --> 35:17.269
there probably isn't any room.

35:17.271 --> 35:19.104
When did it all start?

35:19.106 --> 35:20.973
This...

35:20.975 --> 35:22.441
need to get under our skin.

35:22.443 --> 35:24.210
I don't know, second grade?

35:24.212 --> 35:26.345
That's about when he discovered sarcasm.

35:26.347 --> 35:28.781
Well, I miss first grade Jason.

35:28.783 --> 35:30.282
I liked him.

35:30.284 --> 35:33.118
He believed in me.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.354
Thought I had superpowers, you remember?

35:37.257 --> 35:38.858
I was reminded of that today

35:38.860 --> 35:40.860
with those Reynolds people.

35:40.862 --> 35:42.761
You should have seen the
way they looked at me,

35:42.763 --> 35:44.864
like I could...

35:44.866 --> 35:47.566
wave a wand and make peace appear.

35:48.435 --> 35:50.169
Still no word from Zinchenko?

35:50.171 --> 35:52.171
Nothing.

35:52.173 --> 35:55.341
And if President Salnikov
doesn't support the inspections,

35:55.343 --> 35:56.542
then the deal is dead

35:56.544 --> 35:59.078
and Conrad will lose the House.

35:59.946 --> 36:01.180
Then Iran will get the bomb.

36:09.122 --> 36:11.223
Isn't right about now
when you're supposed to

36:11.225 --> 36:13.325
inspire me with some
great religious quote?

36:13.327 --> 36:15.527
Unfortunately,

36:15.529 --> 36:18.530
most of the quotes I
have for this situation

36:18.532 --> 36:21.033
are about the nobility of suffering.

36:21.801 --> 36:24.737
Maybe just tell me a joke.

36:30.511 --> 36:33.379
So, Thomas Aquinas walks into a bar...

36:38.982 --> 36:40.157
Ma'am.

36:40.158 --> 36:41.791
Mike Barnow.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.661
You know, after over
two years in this office,

36:45.663 --> 36:47.763
I never noticed this painting.

36:47.765 --> 36:49.932
It's beautiful.

36:50.801 --> 36:53.068
You seem busy.

36:54.538 --> 36:56.839
I'm waiting to hear from the Russians.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.841
You need an escape plan.

36:58.843 --> 37:03.579
Pretty sure the DS has
something involving a stairwell.

37:03.581 --> 37:05.181
I mean from this administration.

37:05.183 --> 37:08.384
Unless you enjoy rearranging
deck chairs on the Titanic.

37:08.386 --> 37:10.286
I know Dalton's a lame duck.

37:10.288 --> 37:11.320
Lame?

37:11.322 --> 37:12.621
He's passed on.

37:12.623 --> 37:13.756
This duck is no more.

37:13.758 --> 37:14.924
He has ceased to be.

37:14.926 --> 37:17.226
I'm not resigning my post, Mike.

37:17.228 --> 37:18.427
I know you don't believe me,

37:18.429 --> 37:20.529
but there is a whole
world out there, Elizabeth.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.399
A place where former disgraced officials

37:23.401 --> 37:25.301
can feed at the trough
of corporate greed.

37:25.303 --> 37:27.703
Okay, I have multiple

37:27.705 --> 37:29.145
speaking offers for you and I charge

37:29.169 --> 37:30.773
a very reasonable commission.

37:30.775 --> 37:31.907
Thanks, but no thanks.

37:31.909 --> 37:33.042
Truly.

37:33.044 --> 37:34.777
Can't blame a guy for trying.

37:34.779 --> 37:37.613
Ma'am, we've just received
word from Ambassador Zinchenko.

37:37.615 --> 37:40.282
The Russians are going for it.

37:40.284 --> 37:41.717
How soon can he be here?

37:41.719 --> 37:43.219
He's on his way now.

37:43.221 --> 37:45.502
Matt's writing up your remarks,
but would love your input.

37:45.526 --> 37:47.359
Okay.

37:49.993 --> 37:51.260
Sorry, got to run.

37:51.262 --> 37:53.429
Speaking engagement.

37:59.269 --> 38:01.737
So...

38:03.673 --> 38:05.007
dinner?

38:05.842 --> 38:08.410
No, I doubt it.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.312
Can I at least call you?

38:12.515 --> 38:15.050
You're welcome to try.

38:18.021 --> 38:20.322
Despite speculation to the contrary,

38:20.324 --> 38:22.491
the raid on the Kazym was, in fact,

38:22.493 --> 38:23.726
a joint operation

38:23.728 --> 38:25.594
between the United States

38:25.596 --> 38:28.297
and Russia to interdict contraband

38:28.299 --> 38:30.399
intended for an Iranian weapons program.

38:30.401 --> 38:31.500
That's why today,

38:31.502 --> 38:33.769
we're issuing a joint ultimatum

38:33.771 --> 38:35.437
to the people of Iran.

38:35.439 --> 38:36.438
Inspectors from

38:36.440 --> 38:38.974
the International Atomic Energy Agency

38:38.976 --> 38:40.743
are in the sky as we speak

38:40.745 --> 38:45.347
and will be wheels down
in Tehran within hours.

38:45.349 --> 38:48.384
The Iranian government
must accept the inspections,

38:48.386 --> 38:51.387
surrender all illicit material,

38:51.389 --> 38:53.756
or face the immediate restoration

38:53.758 --> 38:55.357
of the full sanctions regime.

39:16.279 --> 39:18.113
Well, I knew you were angry,

39:18.115 --> 39:20.249
but are you abandoning me?

39:20.251 --> 39:23.385
You know, the first time my
dad took my brother and me

39:23.387 --> 39:24.987
and sisters to D.C.,

39:24.989 --> 39:27.056
I thought we were gonna
go see the monuments,

39:27.058 --> 39:28.757
but he took us here instead.

39:28.759 --> 39:29.925
Why?

39:29.927 --> 39:31.160
To commune with dumpsters?

39:32.229 --> 39:34.163
Well, to tell us about a strike

39:34.165 --> 39:35.885
that happened more than
a hundred years ago.

39:35.909 --> 39:37.866
See that street?

39:37.868 --> 39:40.202
A group of bricklayers marched down it

39:40.204 --> 39:41.603
to demand an eight-hour workday.

39:41.605 --> 39:43.973
But instead of negotiating,
the factory owners

39:43.975 --> 39:46.308
got a local militia together
who opened fire on 'em.

39:46.310 --> 39:47.647
They brought the wounded in here.

39:47.648 --> 39:49.678
Two men died right there.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.113
Seriously?

39:51.982 --> 39:54.350
Is there like, a plaque?

39:54.352 --> 39:55.684
Or a statue or something?

39:55.686 --> 39:57.519
No, I guess that was the point.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.955
You don't always do
things to get a trophy.

39:59.957 --> 40:01.256
My dad...

40:01.258 --> 40:03.338
he fought his whole
life for other people.

40:03.362 --> 40:04.526
Yeah, I know,

40:04.528 --> 40:05.694
you resented him for it.

40:05.696 --> 40:06.936
Yeah, I did. Half the reason

40:06.937 --> 40:09.164
I joined the Marines
was to piss him off.

40:09.166 --> 40:11.200
But over time,

40:11.202 --> 40:14.003
I came to understand that even as a kid,

40:14.005 --> 40:15.245
I was part of something bigger.

40:15.269 --> 40:16.505
Yeah, but you're not sorry

40:16.507 --> 40:18.407
- for joining the Marines.
- God no.

40:18.409 --> 40:21.043
But I had to grow into it.

40:21.045 --> 40:22.811
- You know?
- Yeah.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.017
You've got gifts, Jason.

40:29.052 --> 40:33.055
An incredible facility
for thought and language.

40:33.057 --> 40:35.591
That makes you powerful.

40:35.593 --> 40:37.426
But until you're ready to

40:37.428 --> 40:39.528
fight for something that
you truly believe in,

40:39.530 --> 40:41.764
something that's bigger than yourself,

40:41.766 --> 40:43.899
that power is wasted.

40:43.901 --> 40:46.935
No one's ever gonna take you seriously.

40:46.937 --> 40:49.438
That's all I'm saying.

40:54.811 --> 40:56.512
Two minutes till contact.

40:56.514 --> 40:58.280
Where's the first site?

41:00.584 --> 41:01.750
Chehrehabad.

41:01.752 --> 41:05.421
It's a former salt
mine in Zanjan Province.

41:05.423 --> 41:08.323
Intel from Russia says
that the centrifuges

41:08.325 --> 41:10.793
were headed here.

41:10.795 --> 41:12.494
Will they really let the inspectors in?

41:12.496 --> 41:15.097
If they want to cooperate, then yes.

41:15.099 --> 41:17.466
The moment they refuse entry...

41:17.468 --> 41:18.687
Our nuclear deal is dead.

41:18.688 --> 41:20.602
And we're on a direct
path to confrontation.

41:20.604 --> 41:21.724
Well, they got 'em this far.

41:21.748 --> 41:22.938
That's a good sign.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.974
Sir, the UN is patching us
directly into their feed.

41:37.387 --> 41:38.554
We're here

41:38.556 --> 41:41.323
to inspect the facility.
We're with the IAEA.

41:41.325 --> 41:43.725
What is that?

41:44.561 --> 41:46.328
We're seeing helos.

41:46.330 --> 41:47.596
Military.

41:48.765 --> 41:50.299
They're coming fast.

41:57.373 --> 41:59.875
That does not look like a welcome wagon.

41:59.877 --> 42:01.310
It's NOHED Brigade.

42:01.312 --> 42:03.045
Elite units of the Revolutionary Guard.

42:03.047 --> 42:05.280
They're refusing entry.

42:05.282 --> 42:06.715
We're surrounded.

42:06.717 --> 42:07.716
Get 'em out of there.

42:07.718 --> 42:08.918
Rook to Castle.

42:08.942 --> 42:10.319
Evacuate. I repeat, evacuate.

42:16.392 --> 42:18.026
We've lost contact, sir.

42:19.195 --> 42:22.464
Elizabeth, call an emergency
session of the Security Council.

42:22.466 --> 42:24.099
We need to snap back the
sanctions against Iran.

42:24.101 --> 42:25.221
- Fast.
- Yes, Mr. President.

42:25.245 --> 42:26.768
And I want military strike options

42:26.770 --> 42:28.537
from CENTCOM on my desk within the hour.

42:28.539 --> 42:30.105
- Sir.
- Sir, it won't be long

42:30.107 --> 42:31.640
before this gets out.

42:31.642 --> 42:33.122
We need to figure out how to spin it.

42:33.146 --> 42:35.210
No. No spin.

42:35.212 --> 42:37.379
Make sure that Iran doesn't
get a nuclear weapon.

42:38.581 --> 42:39.815
We just accept defeat.

42:50.154 --> 42:57.654
