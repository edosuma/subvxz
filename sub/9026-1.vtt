00:47.027 --> 00:50.113
Slow down, slow down. Move it back up.

00:50.196 --> 00:52.240
- Here we go.
- They're drivin' me crazy!

00:52.324 --> 00:55.076
- Don't go too fast.
- Come on!

00:55.994 --> 00:58.580
- What's the matter?
- You threw the cage on my foot!

00:58.663 --> 01:00.749
- I didn't do that.
- Yes, you did.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.501
I need puppies.

01:05.962 --> 01:09.049
- Okay. All right. Come on.
- Puppies.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.683
Hi there. Isn't that the sweetest?

02:20.078 --> 02:22.580
- He's cool.
- I think he likes us.

02:38.346 --> 02:39.681
What a cute guy.

02:40.223 --> 02:41.474
Isn't he cute?

03:02.370 --> 03:04.080
Hi, puppy.

03:05.331 --> 03:06.791
No, absolutely not.

03:23.766 --> 03:25.685
How big's he gonna be?

03:26.019 --> 03:28.605
St. Bernards get to be about 150 pounds.

03:29.188 --> 03:32.859
I got a junkyard.
I need a big, mean junkyard dog.

03:34.736 --> 03:35.987
Let me see him.

03:38.406 --> 03:39.866
Come here, puppy.

03:45.038 --> 03:46.706
He looks good and mean.

03:47.624 --> 03:49.792
I don't know. He's pretty sweet.

03:51.169 --> 03:52.962
You can make any dog mean.

03:56.215 --> 03:58.259
Damn little beast! God!

04:02.513 --> 04:04.182
You got any pit bulls?

04:25.578 --> 04:27.038
Come on. It's a pushover.

04:27.121 --> 04:28.623
I cased the place.

04:28.706 --> 04:31.834
What about the cops?
What about video surveillance?

04:32.043 --> 04:35.088
You're crazy if you're gonna walk up
just like this.

04:36.381 --> 04:37.924
What about the alarm?

04:50.561 --> 04:52.522
All you gotta do is step over.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.070
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.

05:00.947 --> 05:03.282
There, you see?
In and out, quiet as a mouse.

05:03.366 --> 05:04.909
Let's get some dogs.

05:08.454 --> 05:11.332
Come on, puppy.
We're just goin' for a little car ride.

05:11.416 --> 05:14.585
Look at the wee, little ones.
Come here, little puppies.

05:14.669 --> 05:15.795
Here we go.

05:17.797 --> 05:21.008
Come on, puppy. Here puppy, nice puppy.

05:28.224 --> 05:29.976
I've stepped in the beam.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.188
Here, puppy, nice puppy.

06:29.952 --> 06:31.621
See, didn't I tell ya?

06:31.704 --> 06:34.040
Doesn't this beat
takin' strays off the street?

06:34.123 --> 06:36.834
- You are a genius!
- Get off!

06:43.633 --> 06:45.760
Sorry! I'm sorry.

06:46.010 --> 06:49.513
I'm just a little bit excited.
That's my very first felony.

06:51.098 --> 06:54.769
I've committed a lot of misdemeanors,
but that was my first felony.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.495
Why are they barking?

07:13.245 --> 07:14.455
They're dogs.

07:14.747 --> 07:17.500
I know they're dogs!
Go in the back and check.

07:20.836 --> 07:23.214
Okay, doggies, what's the racket back...

07:25.466 --> 07:27.885
Okay, doggies, back in your house.

07:28.719 --> 07:32.056
Back in your house.
Here, doggie, nice doggie.

07:34.266 --> 07:35.726
No, doggie. Don't jump.

07:38.604 --> 07:39.647
Bad dog!

07:40.314 --> 07:41.482
Good puppy!

07:42.066 --> 07:43.609
Bad puppy, don't jump!

07:43.693 --> 07:45.319
Good puppy, don't jump!

07:45.403 --> 07:47.279
Come back! Stop the van!

07:49.573 --> 07:52.410
Harv, what is it?
Why did you want me to stop?

07:52.493 --> 07:54.620
Hurry, they're gettin' away.

07:56.163 --> 07:58.165
Hey, you, come back here!

07:58.708 --> 08:01.043
Come here! I'll give you a bone!

08:01.585 --> 08:03.629
Come back here, you little runt!

08:06.549 --> 08:07.925
Come here, you!

10:35.280 --> 10:36.991
7:00 AM. Up and at 'em!

10:52.339 --> 10:53.590
Ted, I'm sorry.

10:55.801 --> 10:58.137
What's wrong?
Did you have another nightmare?

10:58.220 --> 10:59.263
Yeah.

11:01.306 --> 11:05.477
Mom, it's Saturday and it's 7:02.
Do we really have to get up?

11:06.228 --> 11:08.021
Yep, you heard your father.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.234
I know, Daddy's rules.

11:22.870 --> 11:25.456
That's it! I'm not gonna take it anymore.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.753
Mom, I have a news flash for you.
It's Saturday!

11:30.961 --> 11:32.838
- Yeah, I know, honey.
- This sucks!

11:32.921 --> 11:35.257
Why do we have to get up
so early on Saturday?

11:35.340 --> 11:37.593
Ask your father. Don't say "sucks."

11:38.302 --> 11:39.928
The bathroom's mine!

11:41.638 --> 11:44.433
- Nanny, nanny!
- Shut up! Let me in.

11:45.893 --> 11:48.395
Open up, you little wimp! Let me in!

11:49.229 --> 11:52.399
- Mom! Let me in!
- You have no bladder control.

11:52.733 --> 11:56.069
Wait till I get my hands on you. Let me in!

12:05.037 --> 12:06.246
A puppy!

12:08.081 --> 12:09.374
Hi!

12:15.088 --> 12:17.007
Guys, do you have to...

12:17.090 --> 12:20.469
I dreamt I had a puppy, and it came true!

12:26.725 --> 12:28.310
Honey.

12:29.686 --> 12:33.482
I take back everything I said
about you being cold and insensitive.

12:33.941 --> 12:36.652
Dad, I take back
anything I ever said about you, too.

12:36.902 --> 12:39.530
Dad, I have everything I ever wanted.

12:39.613 --> 12:41.448
- I owe you big time.
- Why?

12:42.574 --> 12:44.451
Daddy, can we call him Fred?

12:49.039 --> 12:51.959
- Let me have him. It's my turn.
- No, it's my turn!

12:52.042 --> 12:55.963
- I saw him first!
- I'm gonna have him for five more minutes.

12:57.631 --> 13:00.842
We can't have a dog. We can't have a dog!

13:00.926 --> 13:04.388
You can't show a child a puppy,
then take it away two minutes later.

13:04.471 --> 13:07.349
I didn't show a child a puppy.
It's obviously lost.

13:07.432 --> 13:10.936
- Occupy the kids. I'll run to the pound.
- No, no way!

13:11.228 --> 13:15.023
- It'll be destroyed.
- If we keep it, the house will be destroyed!

13:15.482 --> 13:19.111
- It's a dog. Millions of people have dogs.
- Not people like me.

13:19.653 --> 13:24.074
Dogs sniff. They lick, they chew.
They drool, they scratch...

13:25.075 --> 13:27.995
- Alice, they have parasites.
- Oh, God, yeah.

13:28.078 --> 13:30.539
The kids'll lose interest.
I'll have to care of it.

13:30.622 --> 13:33.250
It'll grow to be enormous.
It'll take over the yard.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.668
The lawn'll look terrible.

13:34.751 --> 13:37.546
When the dog finally settles down, it'll die.

13:37.838 --> 13:41.508
Everybody will be upset. We'll have
to get another puppy. Start all over.

13:41.591 --> 13:44.678
- Do you understand?
- No. Could you be more specific?

13:45.387 --> 13:49.016
- Alice, I need a little support.
- Okay, I'm sorry. All right.

13:52.436 --> 13:54.104
How shall we handle this?

13:54.187 --> 13:55.856
Go tell the kids.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.736
- Come on.
- Come over here.

14:08.577 --> 14:10.120
He loves me the most.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.377
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Dad.

14:17.586 --> 14:20.756
- Can he sleep in my room?
- No, he's sleeping in my room.

14:21.214 --> 14:25.802
- I'm the oldest. He's sleeping in my room.
- He's not sleeping in anyone's room.

14:26.219 --> 14:27.888
Listen to me a minute.

14:28.180 --> 14:32.309
We are "people" people here.
We are "goldfish" people.

14:32.934 --> 14:34.728
We're "ant farm" people.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.063
We're not "dog" people.

14:37.147 --> 14:39.608
Dad, why can't you just give us a chance?

14:39.691 --> 14:42.486
You're always saying
we have to have responsibility.

14:42.569 --> 14:43.737
That's true.

14:49.326 --> 14:52.204
It's my decision. I mean, I've decided.

14:52.996 --> 14:54.331
I knew it!

15:07.803 --> 15:09.763
Better think of something to name him.

15:09.846 --> 15:12.641
When he destroys my house,
I wanna know what to call him!

15:12.724 --> 15:14.684
- Thank you.
- This is temporary.

15:15.393 --> 15:18.104
This is temporary until we find the owner.

15:20.690 --> 15:24.110
Okay, the dog's name will be...

15:26.488 --> 15:28.573
- What is it?
- What's his name gonna be?

15:28.657 --> 15:30.659
You can't change it. That's the rules.

15:30.742 --> 15:31.952
Okay. Emily?

15:32.702 --> 15:34.996
Did you do your name in a crayon?

15:35.956 --> 15:39.584
I don't think words for parts
of the body make good names.

15:39.709 --> 15:42.045
But he's got one of those. I looked.

15:42.128 --> 15:44.548
I'm sure he does, but I don't think Daddy...

15:44.714 --> 15:48.343
wants to stand on the front porch
at night yelling that out.

15:49.302 --> 15:51.721
But that's what you call Uncle Richard.

15:52.639 --> 15:55.183
Okay, the dog's name will be...

16:03.066 --> 16:04.734
You asked for my input.

16:06.903 --> 16:09.739
- What?
- Nothing. Let's just call the dog Rover.

16:09.823 --> 16:12.867
- Mom, please, M. C. Hammer.
- Ultimate Warrior.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.204
M. C. Hammer? No, no, Rover.

16:16.329 --> 16:18.707
He doesn't like any of those names.

16:19.207 --> 16:22.210
- Right! Like you can read his mind!
- Ryce!

16:22.377 --> 16:25.046
Emily, what does the dog
want his name to be?

16:25.171 --> 16:28.550
This is ridiculous! It's a dog.
He doesn't have preferences!

16:28.633 --> 16:31.386
Call him Ding Dong.
He wouldn't know the difference.

16:31.469 --> 16:32.846
Yes, he would!

16:33.471 --> 16:36.057
He'll tell us what he wants to be called.

16:48.862 --> 16:50.113
Beethoven.

17:05.545 --> 17:08.381
Roll over. Come on, boy. Roll over.

19:39.365 --> 19:40.408
You!

19:44.620 --> 19:46.456
No, no, no!

20:11.147 --> 20:13.733
If this business is gonna grow,
we need more money.

20:13.816 --> 20:16.486
They're talking about $25,000.
I said, "That's no good."

20:16.569 --> 20:18.279
They said, "No?" I said, "No."

20:18.363 --> 20:22.283
If this is gonna take off,
I need some capital, not a Band-Aid.

20:22.366 --> 20:25.161
They said, "What kind of figures
are we talking about?"

20:25.244 --> 20:28.414
I said, "$150,000 sounds
like a good neighborhood to me."

20:28.498 --> 20:29.749
You really said that?

20:29.832 --> 20:32.627
This is a business.
What am I gonna do with $25,000?

20:33.252 --> 20:36.130
Advertising, signs, but I'm optimistic.

20:36.756 --> 20:39.258
- Ted, get down here.
- Where's my shoes?

20:39.467 --> 20:42.595
- I don't know, honey, just backtrack.
- Mom, please?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.181
Look behind the bathroom door.

20:45.515 --> 20:47.350
- Daddy?
- What?

20:47.517 --> 20:49.727
He wants you to scratch his head.

20:50.978 --> 20:53.689
You know, I don't wanna scratch his head.

20:53.815 --> 20:55.316
Back off, back off!

20:55.566 --> 20:56.984
But he wants you to.

20:57.068 --> 21:00.071
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
That's not how it works.

21:00.154 --> 21:02.615
If I don't get this deal, I'll kill myself!

21:02.698 --> 21:05.326
Honey, don't talk like that
in front of the kids.

21:05.409 --> 21:09.956
If I can just get them to smell the stuff.
Air fresheners are visceral products...

21:10.081 --> 21:11.958
- I got a great idea.
- What?

21:13.125 --> 21:14.919
Can I have karate lessons?

21:15.795 --> 21:19.173
I didn't get any bacon.
What do you want karate lessons for?

21:19.257 --> 21:22.385
Brenda's littler than me,
and she's got a green belt.

21:22.593 --> 21:25.680
Why don't we skip the lessons
and get you the belt?

21:31.936 --> 21:33.396
No! Come on!

21:35.898 --> 21:39.443
He slimed me! He slobbed! Look at this!

21:39.819 --> 21:41.571
Don't worry about it.

21:41.654 --> 21:43.406
I've got dog drool on my pants!

21:43.489 --> 21:46.909
I can't meet with Vanguard Capital
with dog drool on my pants!

21:46.993 --> 21:50.246
- Just change your pants.
- I'm gonna change my pants.

21:50.371 --> 21:54.208
I had a schedule and now it's gone.
I'll never have that again!

21:54.333 --> 21:56.836
- Just change, George.
- I'm gonna change my pants.

21:56.919 --> 21:58.963
Then I gotta change my jacket.

21:59.046 --> 22:03.551
If I change my jacket, I change my shirt.
If I change my shirt, I change my tie.

22:03.634 --> 22:06.554
I have to change my belt, shoes and socks.

22:06.637 --> 22:09.056
Just change your pants, George.

22:37.835 --> 22:41.422
I don't need you to drool all over me,
for God sakes!

22:41.756 --> 22:45.301
You're so smart!
What am I telling you about?

22:46.385 --> 22:47.678
Listen to me!

23:01.650 --> 23:02.985
Bye, honey.

23:04.111 --> 23:06.113
Sorry. Good luck.

23:07.782 --> 23:09.742
A little Kleenex or something.

23:31.889 --> 23:32.932
Hi, puppy.

23:42.525 --> 23:43.818
Thirsty, huh?

23:43.984 --> 23:46.946
Easy, buddy. Save some for the fishes.

24:56.307 --> 24:59.310
Look at Tom. He's wide open. Shoot it!

24:59.935 --> 25:01.562
Put it up. Put it up!

25:01.812 --> 25:04.315
- This guy's all over me.
- Shoot it.

25:05.024 --> 25:06.191
Yeah!

25:07.109 --> 25:09.695
All right, that's it. Hit the showers.

25:11.864 --> 25:15.117
Give me 10. Let's go, hustle.

25:18.495 --> 25:19.663
Hi, Mark.

25:24.585 --> 25:26.712
- You're sweaty.
- You like it?

25:33.302 --> 25:37.222
Air fresheners are the 12th fastest-growing
area in household hygiene.

25:37.348 --> 25:38.557
Fascinating!

25:38.932 --> 25:42.853
All of these use a two-dip process
that guarantees a longer smell life.

25:42.936 --> 25:45.522
Smell this. That smell nice?

25:47.733 --> 25:51.695
If we get the right amount of capital,
we can take this place to the top.

25:51.779 --> 25:54.990
I don't just mean successful.
I mean dominant.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.619
Here's a favorite. Look at this.

25:59.286 --> 26:01.872
- New leather.
- That's cute.

26:01.955 --> 26:05.125
- I could use that in my Beemer.
- I could use it in my Beemer!

26:05.209 --> 26:07.586
A lot of people could use 'em
in their Beemers.

26:07.670 --> 26:11.340
I wouldn't want to hang it
from my rearview mirror. Tacky!

26:11.423 --> 26:13.425
No, there's Velcro on the back.

26:13.676 --> 26:17.137
People hide them.
A lot put it under their dashboard.

26:17.388 --> 26:20.849
Ingenious! Bravo, Newton. Kudos.

26:21.183 --> 26:22.476
Thank you.

26:32.236 --> 26:33.445
Let's get Ted.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.162
Hey, Teddy boy.
That's a nice lunch you got there.

26:42.704 --> 26:46.333
- A veritable nutrition lesson.
- Oh, yeah.

26:47.084 --> 26:50.921
Don't forget to wash it down
with a big glass of milk.

26:53.132 --> 26:54.466
Oh, man!

26:55.134 --> 26:56.635
See ya on the bus.

27:17.781 --> 27:20.450
Hi! Miss Simpkins made me stay after.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.165
Want a Twinkie?

27:26.665 --> 27:28.208
Hold on a minute.

27:36.091 --> 27:37.176
Good boy.

27:44.516 --> 27:45.809
See over there?

27:46.435 --> 27:48.187
That's Donna Ditsworth.

27:48.353 --> 27:51.648
She's the most popular girl
in the whole school.

27:52.941 --> 27:56.194
Her hair is perfect. Her teeth are perfect.

27:57.321 --> 27:59.364
Even Mark thinks she's perfect.

28:05.704 --> 28:06.955
Beethoven!

28:19.801 --> 28:21.303
Hey, check out Fido.

28:23.555 --> 28:26.767
- What a cool-lookin' dog.
- I bet you wanna play fetch.

28:29.019 --> 28:32.272
You gotta give me the stick
if you want me to throw it.

28:33.106 --> 28:34.358
Where we going?

28:42.324 --> 28:44.201
- Cool dog.
- Cool dog.

28:44.368 --> 28:45.535
Is he yours?

28:46.953 --> 28:49.498
- What's his name?
- Beethoven.

28:49.748 --> 28:52.417
- Wow. Hi, Beethoven.
- Hey, Beethoven.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.544
Cool dog. Good boy.

28:56.046 --> 28:58.632
Well, see you later, Ryce.

29:03.512 --> 29:05.889
Yes! He knows my name!

29:07.974 --> 29:10.227
He knows my name.

29:10.769 --> 29:14.314
No question about it. You've built yourself
something impressive here.

29:14.398 --> 29:15.941
Thank you very much.

29:17.317 --> 29:19.569
- That mean you're interested?
- Absolutely.

29:19.653 --> 29:21.738
We've smelled a lot of stuff.

29:21.863 --> 29:25.409
I speak for myself as well
as the "Brie Meister" when I say...

29:25.492 --> 29:27.285
yours smells the best.

29:28.078 --> 29:30.455
That's great. Thanks a lot.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.833
We're gonna crunch some numbers.

29:32.916 --> 29:35.877
- Maybe we can get together later.
- That would be great.

29:35.961 --> 29:38.547
- We're looking forward to it.
- I'll get it.

29:38.672 --> 29:40.382
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

29:41.508 --> 29:43.468
- Ciao, George.
- Ciao, bello.

29:43.593 --> 29:45.804
- Ciao, bello.
- Ciao!

29:46.304 --> 29:47.472
Ciao.

29:48.849 --> 29:49.891
Ciao.

30:29.723 --> 30:31.641
How ya doin', Theodore?

30:31.808 --> 30:35.145
- Nice backpack, Teddy!
- Can I see it?

30:37.856 --> 30:39.065
Sorry!

30:39.149 --> 30:41.526
Why do you guys always pick on me?

30:41.610 --> 30:44.070
'Cause you're a little four-eyed dork.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.822
Give them back!

30:47.157 --> 30:49.743
They're mine. Give them back!

30:50.202 --> 30:51.786
Where you going, Teddy?

31:02.589 --> 31:05.133
Wait up, Theodore. We wanna walk you home.

31:21.650 --> 31:23.318
What are you, a chicken?

31:23.401 --> 31:24.986
Come on. Scaredy-cat!

31:31.242 --> 31:33.203
Scared? Come on, fight me.

31:33.703 --> 31:36.206
- Now he can't even see.
- Blind as a bat!

31:36.831 --> 31:38.458
What's going on here?

31:40.627 --> 31:41.962
He looks mean!

31:43.505 --> 31:44.547
Yeah.

31:45.507 --> 31:47.926
- Give him the glasses.
- Sorry.

31:56.142 --> 31:57.852
And don't come back!

32:17.914 --> 32:20.500
I know it doesn't mean that he likes me.

32:22.252 --> 32:25.547
But he's gotta like me better
than before he said my name.

32:28.091 --> 32:30.468
You think he could like me, Beethoven?

32:34.264 --> 32:35.974
I know you like me.

32:38.351 --> 32:40.061
Good night, sweetheart.

32:41.146 --> 32:42.272
You, out!

32:43.022 --> 32:44.733
Good night, Beethoven.

32:46.151 --> 32:48.486
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Dad.

32:56.453 --> 32:57.620
Mark.

33:00.623 --> 33:02.834
All right! You, in here!

33:02.959 --> 33:06.421
You sleep in here. I sleep there. You...

33:08.798 --> 33:11.092
See, that's very nice.

33:11.301 --> 33:15.680
That's progress. I appreciate that.
Good night.

33:18.808 --> 33:20.226
Good night.

33:26.316 --> 33:29.986
Ever since you started looking
for investors you seem...

33:30.069 --> 33:34.032
- You wanted us to expand.
- I want you to be happy.

33:34.115 --> 33:36.868
You even said you'd come back to work.

33:37.327 --> 33:40.288
I said I'd give you one wish
for your birthday.

33:41.039 --> 33:43.249
I wish you'd come back to work.

33:45.126 --> 33:49.214
There's other things that are important.
I like being home when the kids get home.

33:49.297 --> 33:51.716
I don't want them
to come home to some stranger.

33:51.799 --> 33:56.137
We'll get a great baby-sitter,
somebody reliable that the kids'll love.

34:29.295 --> 34:31.630
In the third occurrence this month.

34:31.714 --> 34:36.678
We've seen a 500 percent increase
in the reported incidence of stolen pets.

34:36.761 --> 34:39.514
Police believe an animal kidnapping ring
is at work.

34:39.597 --> 34:41.724
That's News Break. Back to The Wolfman.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.185
- Did you hear something?
- No.

34:44.268 --> 34:46.270
I heard something downstairs.

35:56.090 --> 35:58.342
You were right. The TV was on.

35:59.927 --> 36:02.597
I don't know.
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.391
It feels like a good idea to expand...

36:05.516 --> 36:08.770
but I don't want to do it
at everybody's expense.

36:08.853 --> 36:11.939
We have to get somebody wonderful
to take care of the kids.

36:12.023 --> 36:13.566
No question about that.

36:14.901 --> 36:18.070
Sometimes it's hard
to know what the right thing is.

36:19.739 --> 36:22.408
No matter how many showers I take...

36:22.492 --> 36:25.286
I still smell Beethoven all over me.

36:27.497 --> 36:30.500
Are you okay? You're so quiet.

36:31.417 --> 36:34.170
You're not mad at me, are you?

36:38.716 --> 36:39.759
Oh, baby!

36:40.801 --> 36:44.055
Oh, baby, it's not even Saturday night.

36:44.472 --> 36:46.516
Alice, you drive me crazy.

36:48.226 --> 36:51.187
Has Daddy's little girl
been naughty tonight?

36:51.354 --> 36:52.605
George?

36:54.899 --> 36:56.442
Who you talking to?

37:10.289 --> 37:12.792
How dare you! Are you crazy?

37:12.875 --> 37:15.628
Did you think
you were gonna get away with it?

37:18.589 --> 37:20.549
That's how you do it!

37:20.758 --> 37:22.718
I'll put a stop to that.

37:22.802 --> 37:24.804
You've ruined my life!

37:25.221 --> 37:27.932
You've ruined my furniture!
You've ruined my clothes!

37:28.015 --> 37:30.851
My family likes you
more than they like me.

37:30.977 --> 37:34.981
Why? All you do is drool and shed and eat.

37:35.064 --> 37:37.775
You're never getting
out of there again. Never!

37:37.858 --> 37:40.111
Do we understand each other?

38:06.470 --> 38:08.806
Hey, little buddy. How ya doin'?

38:09.348 --> 38:10.933
Thank you. Good work.

38:22.987 --> 38:25.114
- Vernon!
- Come on, Harvey.

38:27.074 --> 38:28.993
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

38:29.076 --> 38:33.456
- I don't like it when you tease the dogs.
- Are you some kind of animal lover?

38:52.475 --> 38:55.060
We've developed a new type of ammunition.

38:55.686 --> 38:57.813
It explodes on contact.

38:58.189 --> 39:01.442
We'd like you to use
this revolver for the tests.

39:01.901 --> 39:05.613
We want to know the extent
of the damage at close range.

39:10.785 --> 39:13.370
You wanna know how messy it is.

39:16.832 --> 39:20.711
I presume you can get dogs
with big skulls for the tests.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.839
Newfoundlands, Great Danes, St. Bernards.

39:23.923 --> 39:26.383
Large dogs are difficult to come by...

39:26.884 --> 39:28.761
harder to manage.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.945
I'm sure we'll be able to handle it.

40:15.599 --> 40:17.268
- Mr. Newton?
- Yes.

40:17.393 --> 40:21.230
I'm Dr. Varnick. This must be Beethoven.

40:23.357 --> 40:26.735
He's a magnificent animal. Magnificent!

40:28.320 --> 40:30.239
Magnificent!

40:31.365 --> 40:33.659
- In for his shots?
- That's right.

40:33.742 --> 40:36.453
He'll be a little groggy this evening.

40:36.745 --> 40:38.622
That'll be nice.

40:38.831 --> 40:42.876
Perhaps you should leave him overnight
for observation.

40:43.419 --> 40:45.212
- I'd be happy to.
- Dad!

40:45.379 --> 40:47.506
It's just a shot. He'll be okay.

40:47.756 --> 40:51.176
Let's take him home.
He's scared and wants to go home.

40:51.385 --> 40:55.639
I wonder if I might have a word
with you privately.

40:56.432 --> 40:57.349
Sure.

40:58.642 --> 41:00.144
Good dog.

41:02.229 --> 41:04.732
Take good care of these nice people.

41:05.357 --> 41:08.319
They aren't gonna hurt Beethoven,
are they?

41:08.652 --> 41:10.738
Nothing could hurt Beethoven.

41:23.125 --> 41:24.752
Please, sit down.

41:27.463 --> 41:30.215
Mr. Newton, have you...

41:32.384 --> 41:36.055
Have you noticed anything strange
about your dog lately?

41:40.934 --> 41:44.605
You know, I mean, he's destroyed my life.

41:46.398 --> 41:48.067
I wish I was kidding.

41:48.192 --> 41:52.571
That's very funny.
St. Bernards have been heavily over-bred.

41:53.489 --> 41:57.409
There's been quite a bit written
about certain behavioral problems.

41:58.368 --> 42:00.245
What kind of problems?

42:01.371 --> 42:06.126
I don't know how to say this, but I've had
to put down several over the past months.

42:07.377 --> 42:09.963
They have a tendency to turn on people...

42:10.047 --> 42:12.132
attack without provocation.

42:13.050 --> 42:15.844
I only mention this
because you have children.

42:24.770 --> 42:25.938
Good boy!

42:28.106 --> 42:31.068
George, come on.
Beethoven isn't even remotely dangerous.

42:31.151 --> 42:32.986
He'd never hurt the kids.

42:33.070 --> 42:35.572
He might take a bite out of you, though.

42:35.989 --> 42:39.660
First snarl, first any kind of weirdness
and he's gone.

42:40.244 --> 42:44.832
Weirdness? What should I watch for,
his wearing my clothes around the house?

42:50.254 --> 42:52.130
Good boy!

42:53.298 --> 42:55.384
You guys are gonna love Devonia.

42:55.467 --> 42:57.719
I don't need a baby-sitter.

42:57.803 --> 43:00.889
How come you gotta
go back to work, anyway?

43:01.181 --> 43:04.768
There's no point of us
going into this with a bad attitude.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.521
Hi there, you little cutie!

43:09.314 --> 43:13.485
Don't you worry about a thing.
We're gonna get along great. Right, kids?

43:14.653 --> 43:17.406
I'll be back before dinner,
so it's not that long.

43:17.489 --> 43:19.283
We're gonna do neat stuff.

43:19.366 --> 43:22.828
I was hopin' we could sing a tune together.
You like music?

43:23.412 --> 43:24.913
What kind of music?

43:24.997 --> 43:29.501
How about Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass? Oh, sorry.

43:30.127 --> 43:32.337
I am a nut for the disco beat!

43:33.922 --> 43:35.591
Okay, kids, be good.

43:54.151 --> 43:57.988
- You've had some time to think and...
- And we made our decision.

44:02.075 --> 44:05.037
We wanna get in bed
with Newton Auto Air Fresheners.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.497
Excellent! That's just great!

44:07.581 --> 44:10.125
- Thank you very much.
- As quickly as possible.

44:10.208 --> 44:13.128
We can meet our lawyers today
and have the papers drawn up.

44:13.211 --> 44:14.588
That's excellent!

44:14.713 --> 44:16.715
Let us take you out to dinner.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.509
Are there any good restaurants
in this burg?

44:19.885 --> 44:21.928
Restaurants. What?

44:23.096 --> 44:26.767
- Why don't you come to our house?
- We'll barbecue.

44:28.018 --> 44:31.730
Barbecue! Let's live dangerously!

44:32.064 --> 44:35.609
Well, our food may not be great,
but it's not dangerous.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.820
I hope it's better than this espresso.

45:41.633 --> 45:42.676
Help!

45:54.855 --> 45:56.523
Help, somebody!

46:49.451 --> 46:50.994
I love you, too.

46:58.084 --> 47:00.879
Thanks, Beethoven. You saved my life.

47:01.838 --> 47:06.176
But you better go home now.
Mom said to stay in the backyard.

47:06.509 --> 47:09.888
You kids might be interested to know
that I am a performer...

47:09.971 --> 47:12.557
Saturday nights at the Padded Zebra.

47:13.725 --> 47:15.727
Gosh! Emily's in the pool!

47:15.810 --> 47:16.853
The pool?

47:19.981 --> 47:22.776
- Emily!
- What are you doing in the pool?

47:22.859 --> 47:26.071
Get out this instant.
You want to get me into trouble?

47:26.821 --> 47:29.115
- Emily, are you all right?
- I fell in.

47:29.366 --> 47:31.951
Oh, Emily, you must've been so scared!

47:32.410 --> 47:34.371
I thought I was gonna die.

47:34.996 --> 47:37.207
You poor little thing.

47:37.540 --> 47:40.835
Now, you were never
in any real danger, were you?

47:40.919 --> 47:46.091
We don't want you to get into trouble,
so we'll let this be our little secret.

47:47.759 --> 47:49.928
I'd like to call my mother, please.

47:50.011 --> 47:52.263
- Your mother?
- Immediately.

47:55.517 --> 47:58.520
She must've snuck out
while I was watching Ted and Ryce.

47:58.603 --> 48:02.565
It was hot out, so I guess
she wanted to take a little swim.

48:03.691 --> 48:05.693
Where were you while this was happening?

48:05.777 --> 48:09.447
Where I was supposed to be,
inside watching the other two.

48:09.614 --> 48:13.451
If Emily had stayed where I put her,
none of this would've happened.

48:13.618 --> 48:17.705
If you ask me, what these children need
is a little discipline.

48:18.206 --> 48:20.875
What these children need is their mother.

48:20.959 --> 48:22.210
You're fired.

48:24.379 --> 48:26.422
- Honey, it was an accident.
- So what?

48:26.506 --> 48:29.592
It is just that we had a bad baby-sitter.

48:29.676 --> 48:33.429
We'll find somebody responsible
to look after the kids.

48:34.472 --> 48:37.142
- Over my dead body.
- Come on.

48:40.770 --> 48:44.774
We're fine on our own.
You don't have to entertain us.

48:52.282 --> 48:53.825
Do you have any kids?

48:58.913 --> 49:00.331
We have a career.

49:00.748 --> 49:02.000
Big one.

49:03.167 --> 49:04.460
Excuse us.

49:10.717 --> 49:12.552
- Brats.
- Monsters.

49:13.136 --> 49:15.263
If we pull this off...

49:15.388 --> 49:19.142
in six months we will own
Newton Auto Air Fresheners.

49:20.143 --> 49:21.686
Touch it.

49:25.690 --> 49:27.108
Sorry for the delay.

49:27.191 --> 49:28.985
- We...
- No problem.

49:29.110 --> 49:31.613
- Vegetables. Here you go.
- Look at that.

49:32.280 --> 49:36.367
- Here's the paperwork, Giorgio.
- I've got my own chair, honey.

49:43.041 --> 49:45.668
- Look at that.
- You gonna do that now, honey?

49:45.752 --> 49:47.170
Alicia.

49:47.462 --> 49:48.796
- Alice.
- Alice.

49:49.213 --> 49:52.175
I'm sorry. Alice.
Could I have a refill, please?

49:53.885 --> 49:54.969
Sure.

49:55.303 --> 49:56.596
Thank you.

50:00.892 --> 50:03.353
Just right down at the bottom, George.

50:04.228 --> 50:07.690
- This is everything we've discussed?
- Yes, exactly.

50:07.774 --> 50:09.942
Right at the bottom, you can sign.

50:13.112 --> 50:15.740
Don't sign that now.
Let's have something to eat?

50:15.865 --> 50:19.202
- You can read it over...
- Alice, tell me about your dog.

50:20.745 --> 50:22.163
Well, he's a dog.

50:22.246 --> 50:25.708
He sure is! Hello, cutesy-ootsy.

50:26.501 --> 50:30.088
- He's a St. Bernard.
- He's a purebred St. Bernard, isn't he?

50:30.213 --> 50:34.676
Hello. Look at that big old tongue
you've got! Yes!

50:35.885 --> 50:38.262
Look at that. Come here. Oh, yeah.

50:38.346 --> 50:41.808
You wanna come with Mommy and Daddy?
Yes, you do.

50:41.891 --> 50:44.268
Come on. We'll come to Mommy and Daddy.

50:44.394 --> 50:46.104
Come on. Come on.

50:46.187 --> 50:48.439
I just love these big, dumb animals.

50:49.107 --> 50:50.775
I bet you do.

50:50.858 --> 50:53.694
Dogs obey so much better
than children, don't they?

50:53.778 --> 50:57.990
Come here. Look, cutesy-ootsy-oogy.

50:58.783 --> 51:04.372
Mama just loves
this great big doggie-woggie.

51:04.831 --> 51:07.166
The places for you to sign...

51:07.542 --> 51:10.294
are marked by that blue clip right there.

51:10.461 --> 51:12.088
This are all standard stuff?

51:12.171 --> 51:15.133
You sure you wanna
"signee-wignee" right now?

51:16.801 --> 51:18.886
Alice, I'm sorry.

51:19.137 --> 51:22.849
I've got that. You be careful.
I don't want you to break a nail.

51:23.683 --> 51:26.185
Right down there where the blue arrow is.

51:26.894 --> 51:28.104
Right there.

51:28.187 --> 51:30.523
Honey, you sit. I've got this.

51:33.442 --> 51:36.154
You guys don't seem
to have made a good impression.

51:36.237 --> 51:37.738
- I'm crushed.
- Me, too.

51:37.822 --> 51:39.365
I'll cry all night.

51:39.448 --> 51:43.202
I don't like 'em either. But these people
are important to Dad's business.

51:43.286 --> 51:46.664
I hope Beethoven slimes that lady's dress.

51:46.998 --> 51:48.833
If you don't want our capital...

51:48.916 --> 51:51.669
we could find another investment
somewhere else.

51:51.752 --> 51:53.212
- Sure!
- No, no, no.

51:55.923 --> 51:59.969
- Beethoven, down, down.
- Is there some problem?

52:00.261 --> 52:02.138
- No, no.
- Did I miss anything?

52:02.221 --> 52:04.891
No. Giorgio has gone over all the papers...

52:05.099 --> 52:07.310
and he's about to sign.

52:08.019 --> 52:10.104
Just standard stuff, really.

52:11.606 --> 52:13.900
Will you get outta here, you mutt!

52:18.070 --> 52:19.906
I pitched in college.

52:38.633 --> 52:39.967
Beethoven, stop!

52:41.218 --> 52:42.261
Bad dog!

52:43.054 --> 52:45.014
Sit! Stop! Stay!

52:45.556 --> 52:46.974
Oh, no!

52:57.526 --> 52:59.153
Beethoven!

53:28.099 --> 53:30.476
I really don't like our dog.

53:32.395 --> 53:34.855
I really don't like those people.

53:36.440 --> 53:38.067
I don't trust them.

53:38.192 --> 53:39.902
I don't want their money.

53:42.863 --> 53:47.284
I know my opinion doesn't matter,
but I'm not interested in expanding.

53:48.285 --> 53:51.580
If I had been home instead
of helping you impress those morons...

53:51.664 --> 53:53.958
Emily wouldn't have fallen in the pool.

53:54.041 --> 53:56.711
And I'm not re-entering the workforce.

53:57.169 --> 53:59.672
You're gonna have to do this on your own.

54:01.340 --> 54:02.550
And you will.

54:02.883 --> 54:05.052
Somehow you'll make your fortune.

54:05.553 --> 54:09.557
And tucked away behind you, deep
in the shadows, will be me and the kids.

54:15.938 --> 54:19.942
That's how you see me.
Suddenly I'm a lousy husband and father.

54:20.568 --> 54:24.530
Everything was fine
until Beethoven came into our lives.

54:26.782 --> 54:30.244
I've tried to be patient, but I've had it.

54:30.911 --> 54:32.663
The dog has to go.

54:33.289 --> 54:34.832
I'm proud of Beethoven.

54:34.915 --> 54:37.877
Those two idiots insulted your kids
and treated me like dirt.

54:37.960 --> 54:42.089
He was the only one who had the nerve
to give them the ride they deserved.

54:44.300 --> 54:45.926
I'm going to bed.

54:47.595 --> 54:51.223
My dream's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dog.

54:53.976 --> 54:57.897
Your family's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dream.

55:21.503 --> 55:24.215
Why do we gotta be so quiet?

55:53.452 --> 55:54.828
You're a big boy!

56:31.573 --> 56:34.201
- Sit down.
- We made you breakfast, Dad.

56:34.326 --> 56:37.746
- Scrambled eggs the way you like them.
- I fed Beethoven.

56:37.830 --> 56:39.289
We washed him, too.

56:41.583 --> 56:43.293
You should smell him.

56:43.419 --> 56:45.546
I'll walk Beethoven every day.

56:45.671 --> 56:50.384
We divided up the dog chores so you won't
have to do anything for Beethoven.

56:51.135 --> 56:52.344
I see.

56:52.761 --> 56:56.056
Is there anything else you need?
Anything else at all?

56:57.224 --> 56:59.685
No, thank you. I'm fine.

57:04.106 --> 57:06.734
I dropped part of an eggshell in there.

57:08.068 --> 57:09.611
Chew carefully, Dad.

57:15.242 --> 57:18.120
Okay, fine. Great, Ryce.
I'm gonna get that thing.

57:18.203 --> 57:20.289
- That leaf's mine.
- I get the next one!

57:20.372 --> 57:22.666
Okay, fine. Get that question box.

57:24.126 --> 57:25.461
Give me five.

57:25.544 --> 57:26.920
Shake.

57:33.051 --> 57:34.303
Mrs. Newton.

57:34.761 --> 57:37.264
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Varnick, the veterinarian.

57:38.182 --> 57:42.478
I'm sorry to trouble you,
but I wonder if I might come in?

57:45.439 --> 57:46.773
Sure. Come in.

57:47.274 --> 57:49.067
With animals as large as yours...

57:49.151 --> 57:53.113
I like to do a follow-up on rabies shots
just to see how he's doing.

57:53.197 --> 57:56.283
- It's nice of you to come down here.
- No trouble at all.

57:56.366 --> 57:59.495
- Here you go.
- Thank you. I'll only be a moment.

57:59.578 --> 58:02.539
- Would you like a lemonade?
- No, thank you.

58:02.789 --> 58:03.957
All right.

58:04.583 --> 58:07.461
Beethoven, how are you doing?

58:11.632 --> 58:13.550
Lookin' good. Lookin' good.

58:21.600 --> 58:25.520
Beethoven, this is gonna hurt you
a lot more than it hurts me.

58:27.356 --> 58:30.317
But it's a great benefit to mankind.

58:31.652 --> 58:33.028
Put some of this here.

58:33.695 --> 58:36.365
- I'm gonna get those bones.
- No, I get some!

58:36.448 --> 58:37.824
You get the next.

58:42.120 --> 58:44.998
Okay, that'll do ya.

58:49.753 --> 58:51.129
All right now.

58:56.593 --> 58:59.888
- No!
- Emily, what's the matter?

59:00.222 --> 59:02.224
Come on, you big stupid mutt!

59:05.477 --> 59:06.937
Help! Help!

59:11.191 --> 59:13.610
George! Oh, my God!

59:13.902 --> 59:16.822
Help, somebody! Help!

59:16.905 --> 59:18.991
Good boy. Good boy!

59:19.282 --> 59:22.160
Beethoven! Beethoven!

59:22.285 --> 59:24.121
- No!
- Get off him.

59:24.413 --> 59:25.622
Beethoven!

59:27.040 --> 59:29.793
Beethoven. Oh, my gosh, Beethoven!

59:29.876 --> 59:31.461
Why'd he do that?

59:32.838 --> 59:34.297
My gosh, look what he did!

59:34.381 --> 59:37.342
- Are you all right?
- Well, I don't know.

59:37.509 --> 59:40.345
- What happened?
- He just lunged at me!

59:40.637 --> 59:43.598
That's not true. I saw you hit Beethoven.

59:43.849 --> 59:47.978
- Emily, please.
- Why would I? I patted him on the head.

59:48.895 --> 59:51.523
It's possible that from a distance the child...

59:51.606 --> 59:52.816
Liar!

59:52.983 --> 59:56.069
- Emily!
- I'm sorry. Everything's all right.

59:56.153 --> 59:59.448
It's very natural the child would want
to defend her dog.

59:59.531 --> 01:00:02.617
- Let's call an ambulance.
- No, I'll take care of it.

01:00:02.743 --> 01:00:04.745
I'll take care of this myself.

01:00:08.832 --> 01:00:12.794
I'm terribly sorry.
He's never done anything like this before.

01:00:12.878 --> 01:00:16.882
Once an animal crosses the line
and attacks a human being...

01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:19.885
you can rest assured he'll do it again.

01:00:19.968 --> 01:00:22.721
Of course, next time
it could be one of your children.

01:00:22.804 --> 01:00:25.599
I'm very, very sorry. Let me help.

01:00:27.851 --> 01:00:30.353
Mr. Newton, we have a real problem here.

01:00:30.479 --> 01:00:33.523
The law is very clear
when it comes to dealing with this.

01:00:33.607 --> 01:00:36.359
Unless you bring the animal
to my office immediately...

01:00:36.443 --> 01:00:39.488
I'm afraid I'll be forced to press charges.

01:00:46.328 --> 01:00:47.829
I'm so sorry.

01:01:00.592 --> 01:01:03.386
I don't want anything
to happen to Beethoven.

01:01:06.723 --> 01:01:09.726
Dad won't believe us
'cause he hates Beethoven.

01:01:09.809 --> 01:01:12.229
He's always hated Beethoven.

01:02:07.117 --> 01:02:08.743
Dad has Beethoven!

01:02:08.827 --> 01:02:11.246
Wait, wait! Stop!

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:20.297
Stop! Daddy!

01:02:24.092 --> 01:02:25.135
Wait!

01:02:25.885 --> 01:02:26.970
Wait!

01:02:51.494 --> 01:02:54.664
My dad had to take our dog
to the vet to be put down.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.085
I hated him for it.

01:03:00.003 --> 01:03:01.713
Now I'm doing it myself.

01:03:06.134 --> 01:03:09.637
I know you won't believe me,
but I don't wanna do this.

01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:16.144
You understand.

01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:20.065
It's not your fault.

01:03:45.715 --> 01:03:47.550
- Mr. Newton.
- Dr. Varnick.

01:03:49.928 --> 01:03:52.472
I know that you're doing the right thing.

01:03:54.015 --> 01:03:55.183
I hope so.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.392
Follow me.

01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:03.066
Come on. Come on.

01:04:04.192 --> 01:04:05.568
How's your arm?

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.070
It's fine.

01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:11.115
- Thirty-seven stitches.
- I'm so sorry.

01:04:12.033 --> 01:04:14.369
Do you want the collar and tags?

01:04:14.452 --> 01:04:18.873
- Some people like to keep them.
- Yeah.

01:04:19.457 --> 01:04:22.418
Do you mind? I have the bad wing.

01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:26.506
Come here. Come here.

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:46.693
I'm sorry.

01:04:48.736 --> 01:04:50.488
You were my dog, too.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.877
Sad state of affairs.

01:05:05.169 --> 01:05:08.256
Sad state of affairs.
Come on, boy. Come on.

01:05:09.882 --> 01:05:11.134
Come on, boy.

01:05:13.052 --> 01:05:15.263
In you go. There you go.

01:05:16.806 --> 01:05:19.684
All right. Magnificent.

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:36.868
George Newton.

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:40.163
We're gonna have to charge you
for a day's boarding...

01:05:40.246 --> 01:05:43.875
because Jimmy, who handles
the lethal injections and disposals...

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:47.545
he doesn't work today, so we're gonna
have to hold the dog overnight.

01:05:47.628 --> 01:05:49.088
Should we bill you?

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:42.934
Dog killer!

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:49.524
Nice dog, huh, Doc?
He's perfect for the animal experiment.

01:06:49.607 --> 01:06:52.026
Get everything ready.
I'll be by in the morning.

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:54.529
We'll do the test on him first thing.

01:06:54.654 --> 01:06:55.988
All right.

01:07:03.746 --> 01:07:05.623
Nice doggie, good doggie.

01:07:05.706 --> 01:07:07.333
Okay, close the door.

01:07:07.416 --> 01:07:09.293
I've got him. Come on!

01:07:11.838 --> 01:07:13.965
Good doggie. Come here, doggie.

01:07:14.507 --> 01:07:16.384
- Okay, I got him.
- Good, good.

01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:20.721
- I got him. Come on, doggie.
- Not you! The dog!

01:07:21.722 --> 01:07:24.058
Put him in. Okay, you got him?

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.893
In the cage. Get in.

01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:37.947
Shut up!

01:07:39.657 --> 01:07:40.741
There.

01:07:41.659 --> 01:07:44.161
Doc will work on him
first thing in the morning...

01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:46.414
and then he's one dead puppy.

01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:47.873
Can we eat?

01:07:48.666 --> 01:07:50.668
- Yeah. You hungry?
- Yeah. I'm hungry.

01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:54.171
- What do you feel like?
- A chef's salad.

01:08:05.975 --> 01:08:07.893
Did I do the wrong thing?

01:08:10.229 --> 01:08:11.939
I don't know, honey.

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:18.571
Beethoven made this house real.

01:08:22.325 --> 01:08:24.243
He put the dents in it.

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:30.957
I know he slobbered and he smelled bad,
but he loved us.

01:08:34.295 --> 01:08:35.546
Even you.

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:45.680
I just hope your motives were pure,
and you did this for the safety of the kids.

01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:48.768
I really hate to think
we sold Beethoven down the river...

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:52.063
for a piece of carpet
or a chance to sell more air freshener.

01:08:52.145 --> 01:08:55.899
It had nothing to do with carpet
or air freshener. You saw what he did.

01:08:55.983 --> 01:08:58.861
I know. But we don't know why he did it.

01:08:58.944 --> 01:09:02.907
Maybe the vet didn't hit him, but maybe
he handled him too rough or something.

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.201
Emily's really sticking to this.

01:09:05.283 --> 01:09:08.578
Have we ever known her to attack an adult
and accuse them of lying?

01:09:08.662 --> 01:09:11.582
No, but why would a vet
say something like that?

01:09:11.665 --> 01:09:14.542
Instead of listening to some guy
we've met only twice...

01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:18.506
maybe we should try listening
to our own child.

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:22.343
Honey, something doesn't make sense.
Can't we just talk to him?

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.263
What do you want me to do?

01:09:26.346 --> 01:09:29.350
Dr. Varnick, are you sure
you didn't hit our dog?

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:32.728
Yes, Mr. Newton,
I just remembered I did hit your dog.

01:09:32.812 --> 01:09:35.981
- Come on!
- It'd make me feel better. Let's go.

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:40.569
- I'm coming with you.
- So am I.

01:09:40.653 --> 01:09:42.571
We're all going with you.

01:09:58.754 --> 01:10:00.005
I'm terribly sorry.

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:02.341
- We want our dog back!
- Where's Beethoven?

01:10:02.424 --> 01:10:05.136
- Kids, let Daddy handle this.
- What can I do for you?

01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:08.013
- We want our dog back!
- I'm terribly sorry.

01:10:08.222 --> 01:10:11.183
It's too late. The dog's been destroyed.

01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:13.853
- Dad?
- Now, wait a minute.

01:10:14.645 --> 01:10:17.022
I was told this wouldn't happen
until tomorrow.

01:10:17.106 --> 01:10:18.691
I don't believe you!

01:10:20.526 --> 01:10:22.903
Take your hands off her! What are you...

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:29.660
I told you he was lying!

01:10:30.995 --> 01:10:33.414
What the hell are you trying to pull?

01:10:34.373 --> 01:10:36.834
You can't come in here.
This is private property.

01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:38.043
Beethoven?

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.800
- He's not here.
- Hold it right there.

01:10:44.884 --> 01:10:47.595
You have no right to be in here.
Out, all of you.

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:48.929
Where's my dog?

01:10:50.097 --> 01:10:52.057
I don't have to answer your questions.

01:10:52.141 --> 01:10:55.853
You ordered that dog destroyed,
and it was done. Now get out.

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.275
You hit me, I'll have you put in jail
for assault and battery.

01:11:12.077 --> 01:11:12.953
Dad!

01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:15.247
- Honey!
- That was amazing.

01:11:15.748 --> 01:11:17.458
Dad, you were awesome.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.503
- You were really cool.
- I never found you more attractive.

01:11:23.172 --> 01:11:24.715
I may need an X-ray.

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:28.927
- He said our dog bit him.
- But he didn't really. Tell him.

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:32.264
There were no bite marks on his arm!

01:11:32.514 --> 01:11:34.933
"So what?" What do you mean?

01:11:36.852 --> 01:11:39.313
I'd like to file a report on you!

01:11:40.814 --> 01:11:43.442
- They're not going to help us?
- Not this year.

01:11:43.525 --> 01:11:45.319
- Dad! Dr. Varnick.
- Look!

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:57.956
Let's follow him.

01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:01.001
Maybe he'll lead us to Beethoven.

01:12:06.215 --> 01:12:08.384
Hold your door. Hold your door.

01:12:10.636 --> 01:12:11.678
Shut it.

01:12:18.185 --> 01:12:20.813
Dad, haven't you ever followed anyone?

01:12:21.105 --> 01:12:22.648
Turn off your lights.

01:12:44.837 --> 01:12:47.923
- I think that's the last of it.
- Start getting the dogs.

01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:49.091
The dogs?

01:12:49.675 --> 01:12:52.678
Yeah! He said we gotta destroy
all the evidence.

01:13:36.263 --> 01:13:38.056
I'm gonna check this out.

01:13:47.983 --> 01:13:50.736
It's 9:30. If I'm not back in 15 minutes...

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.071
call the police.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.366
Don't come in after me.

01:14:02.748 --> 01:14:07.252
Before you destroy the dogs, bring me
the St. Bernard for the ammo test.

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:08.837
Okay.

01:14:10.172 --> 01:14:13.258
And bring me a little one
for this chemical test.

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:15.594
Sure. I know just the one.

01:14:16.303 --> 01:14:17.387
Hurry up.

01:14:35.322 --> 01:14:36.406
Latch.

01:14:43.121 --> 01:14:46.041
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a pioneer.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.627
- Like Davy Crockett, right?
- Right.

01:15:07.187 --> 01:15:08.522
Good doggie!

01:15:18.782 --> 01:15:21.159
Oh, no! No, no!

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:42.347
I'm saving you. I'm saving you!

01:15:56.611 --> 01:15:59.197
He pushed me on the ground,
and I couldn't get up.

01:16:04.244 --> 01:16:06.872
Emily, come on. Here, Ryce, take her.

01:16:06.955 --> 01:16:10.709
Lock the doors. If I'm not back in 15...

01:16:10.959 --> 01:16:14.504
- I'll be back.
- Lock the doors. Lock that one.

01:16:22.304 --> 01:16:23.638
Nice doggie.

01:16:25.265 --> 01:16:27.976
We're gonna have a field test
with this new ammo.

01:16:30.604 --> 01:16:31.688
So long.

01:16:43.158 --> 01:16:45.619
You're a very foolish man, Mr. Newton.

01:16:47.245 --> 01:16:49.581
You should've left well enough alone.

01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:58.298
- That was a gun!
- Daddy!

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:01.009
- Mom, get over here!
- There's no time!

01:17:07.557 --> 01:17:10.352
I don't know where.
It's a big thing, a warehouse!

01:17:10.435 --> 01:17:13.772
- Buckle up.
- You can't drive. You don't have a license!

01:17:14.522 --> 01:17:17.108
- We're going in!
- What are you doing?

01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:19.277
I don't know. It's a...

01:17:23.114 --> 01:17:25.158
Ted! Ted!

01:17:48.848 --> 01:17:50.517
- Cool.
- Dad!

01:17:52.227 --> 01:17:54.354
Dad! Dad!

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:57.190
My babies! Are you all right?

01:17:58.066 --> 01:17:59.943
- Beethoven!
- Beethoven!

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:04.698
- I love this dog. What a good doggie!
- George!

01:18:05.532 --> 01:18:07.575
George! Oh, my God!

01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:09.452
Be careful!

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:14.040
- Is everyone alive?
- Where were you?

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:16.167
I was shopping! I called the police.

01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:19.421
- I jumped. I fell on the guys.
- You're kidding?

01:18:19.504 --> 01:18:22.590
- You let Ted drive!
- I didn't let him! Don't yell at me!

01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:24.551
I'm not yelling.

01:18:25.051 --> 01:18:26.553
I love you, too.

01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:30.557
- You're free!
- You can go home!

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.559
You're free! You're free!

01:18:47.532 --> 01:18:48.575
Go, go!

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.452
Sic 'em, boys!

01:19:15.477 --> 01:19:17.187
Help! Get outta my way!

01:19:29.824 --> 01:19:31.034
Oh, my God!

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:32.869
Out of my way!

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.213
Come on, Harvey. Over the fence.

01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:02.106
You thought you could get me,
you feebleminded mongrels!

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:06.152
- Stupid, stupid doggies!
- Never! You'll never get me!

01:20:10.198 --> 01:20:12.867
- Never!
- Stupid, stupid doggies.

01:20:12.951 --> 01:20:14.744
Stupid, stupid doggies!

01:20:17.163 --> 01:20:18.665
Stupid, stupid...

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.750
You little mangy thing!

01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:22.961
And you and you, you little one!

01:20:23.044 --> 01:20:24.754
Never! Never!

01:20:25.463 --> 01:20:26.881
You little mangy...

01:20:27.131 --> 01:20:28.299
What?

01:20:48.236 --> 01:20:51.030
The final chapter
of a horror story for animal lovers...

01:20:51.114 --> 01:20:54.617
concluded at County Courthouse today.
Ruth Walters has the details.

01:20:54.867 --> 01:20:57.829
- Animal lovers everywhere appeared...
- It's us!

01:20:57.912 --> 01:21:02.667
...when Dr. Varnick and two associates
were indicted on animal abuse.

01:21:04.043 --> 01:21:06.671
These were scientific investigations!

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:11.509
And leading the cheers
were the ring's unlikely captors...

01:21:11.592 --> 01:21:13.928
the Newton family of Valley Vista.

01:21:15.012 --> 01:21:17.515
I had no choice but to do what I did.

01:21:18.266 --> 01:21:22.228
Beethoven is not just some dog
that wandered in off the street.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:25.606
He's a member of our family
and we love him very much.

01:21:25.815 --> 01:21:27.984
Have you always been a dog lover?

01:21:33.948 --> 01:21:37.243
Maybe not as much as now.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.619
Thank you.

01:21:41.622 --> 01:21:44.751
This is Ruth Walters reporting
from County Courthouse.

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:50.673
Okay, guys. Let's go to bed.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.217
- Do we have to?
- It's been a long day.

01:21:54.177 --> 01:21:57.221
- You look beautiful.
- Daddy, you're the best.

01:21:57.722 --> 01:22:00.892
- Good night, Dad. I love you.
- Good night, sweetheart.

01:22:00.975 --> 01:22:02.768
Say good night to Daddy.

01:22:03.144 --> 01:22:06.230
- Can I stay up?
- You are up!

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:09.984
Go to sleep.

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:14.113
Hello? Yeah.

01:22:15.198 --> 01:22:17.742
Hold on one second.

01:22:18.075 --> 01:22:19.785
Ryce? Who's calling?

01:22:20.453 --> 01:22:21.537
Ryce!

01:22:22.663 --> 01:22:24.624
- Don't stay on too long.
- Okay.

01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:26.584
Dad, who is it?

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:31.130
Somebody who saw you on TV.
Mark something.

01:22:31.589 --> 01:22:32.715
Mark.

01:22:35.092 --> 01:22:36.177
Hello?

01:22:37.512 --> 01:22:38.679
Yeah.

01:22:39.347 --> 01:22:40.431
No.

01:22:42.475 --> 01:22:44.852
Really? Friday?

01:22:48.898 --> 01:22:51.067
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

01:22:53.361 --> 01:22:54.528
Sleep tight.

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:00.326
Good night, Beethoven.

01:23:01.702 --> 01:23:03.204
Good night, Sparky.

01:23:03.829 --> 01:23:06.582
- Good night, Mitch.
- Good night, Murphy.

01:23:08.292 --> 01:23:10.127
Good night, Sally.

01:23:10.336 --> 01:23:11.963
Good night, Lacey.

01:23:12.505 --> 01:23:13.631
Good night, Fred.

01:23:13.923 --> 01:23:15.132
Good night, Eliot.
