WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.585
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.795 --> 00:03.711
Hundreds of your people

00:03.921 --> 00:04.879
are trapped inside
Mount Weather.

00:05.089 --> 00:06.589
My people are
prisoners there, too.

00:06.799 --> 00:07.507
Aah!

00:07.716 --> 00:09.467
The only way
to save both our people

00:09.677 --> 00:10.551
is if we join together.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.053
That leads
to an antenna on the ground.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.513
We could send a message.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.223
This is Jasper Jordan.
We need help.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.683
You were right.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.685
Without someone on the inside,
an army is useless.

00:18.894 --> 00:19.978
You should go.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.479
There's a mine entrance
closer to where

00:21.689 --> 00:23.606
the reapers
hand us over.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.736
Teig em kam
ran tribou de.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.789
Harvest. Harvest.
Harvest them all.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.083
Get up.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.477
Yah!

01:11.530 --> 01:14.365
Yaagh! Aagh!

01:14.575 --> 01:16.451
Ugh!

01:28.630 --> 01:31.424
Nngh!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.301
Agh...

01:41.894 --> 01:45.688
Aah! Aah!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.150
Ah!

01:52.696 --> 01:56.115
Uh! Ah!

01:56.325 --> 01:58.284
Aah!

02:02.164 --> 02:08.753
Aah!

02:44.248 --> 02:46.499
Monty has been missing
for two days,

02:46.750 --> 02:49.544
Harper longer
than that.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.839
We'll keep looking.
We'll find them.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.134
We both know
where they are.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.219
Checked the harvest
chamber last night.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.138
So check it again.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.187
They took
my best friend.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.652
All right.
I'll check again.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.616
You have to look like
there's nothing wrong,

03:20.826 --> 03:23.286
like everything
is OK.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.912
Yeah.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.208
Don't do
anything stupid.

03:34.131 --> 03:38.050
It's OK.
Everything is OK.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.385
Everything is...

03:41.930 --> 03:43.139
Not OK.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.351
Time to do something stupid.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.111
Target acquired.

03:57.321 --> 04:01.115
The riders from Tondc
got here fast.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.785
They're slowing
down.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.749
Make that stopping.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.669
Hell, I could
make that shot.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.047
Check that.
We'll wait.

04:17.549 --> 04:20.134
Mom, why
are we stopping?

04:20.344 --> 04:22.220
You need
to drink, too.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.848
I'm fine.
We're almost home.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.017
Our scouts
patrol these woods.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.310
Be careful
where you shoot.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.353
Yes, ma'am.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.189
The grounders
listen to you.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.483
Lexa told them to.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.736
We shouldn't
have stopped.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.488
Mount up.
Clarke...

04:40.697 --> 04:43.157
Mom, I need to get
back to that radio

04:43.367 --> 04:45.618
to see if Bellamy
has made contact.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.453
I know you don't
think you need

04:47.663 --> 04:51.040
my protection anymore,
but you do.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.209
You have to trust
that I know

04:53.418 --> 04:55.378
what's right for us.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.385
Let's go home.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.683
There's your shot.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.853
Crosswind--5 knots.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.981
Uh! Oh!

05:16.858 --> 05:18.234
Mountain men.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.444
Yah! Hah!

05:26.159 --> 05:28.619
No. Her kill.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.418
Yaagh! Uh! Huh!

05:35.627 --> 05:38.921
Oh!

05:39.131 --> 05:41.507
Uh! Huh!

05:42.551 --> 05:44.218
Finish it.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.220
Octavia, no.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.848
He's from Mount Weather.
We need to keep him alive.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.349
Check to see if he's got
a patch kit.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.518
We've got to get him
back to camp.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.038
What is that?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.586
Clarke, you and Lexa
were the targets.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.425
We have to warn
the commander.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.890
Yah! Yah!

06:47.366 --> 06:49.575
Uh...

06:52.996 --> 06:54.705
Uh! Uh!

06:54.915 --> 06:56.332
Nngh!

07:06.843 --> 07:10.388
I can't--
I don't understand you.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.641
Sky person?

07:21.483 --> 07:24.068
I take it no one
has told you

07:24.277 --> 07:26.654
we're not enemies
anymore.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.953
I need to get
out of this cage.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.247
And then what?

07:38.083 --> 07:41.252
And then I'll kill
everyone in this Mountain.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.135
President Wallace...

07:50.262 --> 07:52.221
Can we talk?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.557
What's on
your mind, son?

07:54.766 --> 07:57.351
My friends.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.438
What about them?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.732
Two of them
are missing.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.111
One of them is Monty.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.822
Tell me where they are.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.699
Jasper, I don't know
what you're--

08:11.908 --> 08:13.701
stop lying.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.202
Excuse me?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.704
You lied about there
not being any survivors

08:16.913 --> 08:18.581
from the ark.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.667
You lied about
Maya's accident.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.419
I don't even know how many
lies you told about Clarke.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.588
Please sit down,
and we'll--

08:25.797 --> 08:28.466
no!

08:30.218 --> 08:33.137
You're gonna
tell me the truth.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.602
Jasper, please

08:39.811 --> 08:41.520
put down the sword.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.732
Why should I, so I can
disappear next?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.484
Where are they?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.319
I told you,
I don't know

08:48.528 --> 08:51.155
what happened
to your friends.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.872
Do I look
desperate to you?

09:00.081 --> 09:03.000
Because I'm feeling
pretty desperate.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.836
You're right.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.632
I did lie to you
about Clarke,

09:09.841 --> 09:12.676
about the survivors
from the ark,

09:12.886 --> 09:15.679
and about what
happened to Maya.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.973
I'm trying to
protect you, Jasper,

09:18.183 --> 09:19.350
all of you.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.436
Where are they?
Where the hell is Monty?

09:24.523 --> 09:28.567
This is not a toy.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.500
Yes, sir?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.418
Could you please find out
where Dr. Tsing

09:46.628 --> 09:49.505
and my son are
at the moment?

09:49.714 --> 09:53.342
Anything else, sir?

09:53.552 --> 09:55.511
Not presently.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.102
I need a location...

10:03.311 --> 10:06.355
Let's take a walk.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.190
Where?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.110
To find your friends.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.910
Lock that down!
Close the gate! Move! Move!

10:20.120 --> 10:21.620
Let's go. Go. Move.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.417
Set him down.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.086
I need blood--
o neg., a lot.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.421
This guy is from
Mount Weather.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.339
We need
to keep him alive.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.718
Lock him down.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.554
There was a tear in his suit,
but we fixed it in the field.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.472
Anything
from Bellamy?

10:40.682 --> 10:41.640
No.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.183
Then why aren't you
at the radio?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.644
Octavia just took my place.
How about you back off?

10:45.854 --> 10:46.979
No. Leave it on.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.022
It's the only thing
keeping him alive.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.982
Well how can we treat a guy
if we can't touch him?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.776
I can rig up some
scrubbers in the airlock.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.820
Give me 20 minutes.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.948
Damn it.
I'm losing him.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.534
I need the blood now.
Move.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.538
OK. Come on.
Stay with me.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.290
Come on. Fight.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.670
Uh...

11:13.256 --> 11:14.923
He's gone.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.888
Yu gonplel ste odon.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.982
A killer lives while
a warrior dies?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.400
This is your way?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.985
I'm sorry, Indra,

11:35.195 --> 11:36.737
but he can help us
beat Mount Weather.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.698
Then let me
make him talk.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.451
No. We're not
torturing him.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.912
Clark is right.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.540
He might just talk
because we saved his life.

11:48.750 --> 11:53.420
You people
are so weak.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.849
Are you OK?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.854
He's gonna need a transfusion
with our blood.

12:11.064 --> 12:11.855
I'll type him
as soon as we

12:12.065 --> 12:13.607
can take off
that suit.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.906
Someone tried
to kill you today.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.283
It's OK
if you're upset.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.248
Just another day
on the ground.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.252
I'll be
in engineering

12:33.461 --> 12:35.379
waiting for Bellamy
to radio.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.589
Let me know
when he wakes up.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.309
Here they come.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.477
Quiet.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.444
Yeah.
This one'll do.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.283
Naah! Ah!

13:07.078 --> 13:09.288
We got us
a live one.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.707
Ohh! Uh!

13:17.630 --> 13:19.423
Agh! Agh!

13:19.674 --> 13:21.675
Huh!

14:14.145 --> 14:15.687
Sergeant Lovejoy, hi.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.980
Where's Thorpe?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.106
I need to go over
the treatment schedule

14:18.316 --> 14:19.399
so I know ho many
cages to clear.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.818
He just left.
Thanks.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.152
I'll try
to catch him.

14:30.328 --> 14:33.121
She's done
an hour early.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.335
25-minute treatment.
That's got to be a record.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.254
You really need
Thorpe now, huh?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.255
Yeah.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.422
You know, I think
he said something

14:42.590 --> 14:44.007
about going to the mess hall.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.009
Thanks.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.914
Who are you?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.752
You're from the ark,
aren't you?

16:04.631 --> 16:05.923
Yeah.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.386
Do you know Jasper?

16:11.596 --> 16:12.638
Maya?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.518
How about getting
me down, Maya?

16:26.611 --> 16:29.655
Lovejoy, hey.

16:29.864 --> 16:30.906
What are you
doing here?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.783
You're not cleared
for this facility.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.119
I know. I'm sorry.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.999
I just wanted to see what
was so special about him,

16:41.209 --> 16:42.918
but...

16:44.754 --> 16:46.588
He's dead.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.887
So he is.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.822
You're a brave girl
coming in here--

17:15.493 --> 17:18.453
don't move.
Don't move!

17:19.747 --> 17:22.374
On your feet.
On your feet.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.419
Aah! Ah! Uh!

17:32.260 --> 17:33.301
Stop!

17:33.511 --> 17:34.553
Don't.
They'll hear.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.555
Yaah!
Uh!

17:45.648 --> 17:47.816
Aagh!

17:56.492 --> 17:57.784
Agh!
Aah!

18:28.274 --> 18:30.776
Thank you.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.075
You all right?

18:46.876 --> 18:49.753
Hey, you OK?

18:51.547 --> 18:54.257
I'm fine.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.889
Help me get him
undressed.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.768
We need to get rid
of the body.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.536
Raven did
a good job.

19:22.745 --> 19:26.873
The airlock is
radiation-free.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.750
When will he
wake up?

19:30.795 --> 19:34.381
Soon. Our blood
heals them.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.341
It's incredible.
Yeah.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.969
That's why the kids in
Mount Weather are in trouble.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.888
My kid
is in trouble.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.310
They tried to kill
her, Marcus.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.689
They missed.
Clarke is strong.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.066
She's not
that strong.

19:53.276 --> 19:56.403
The grounders look at her
like she's our leader,

19:56.612 --> 19:58.488
and now Mount Weather
does, too.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.782
Clarke is holding
this alliance together,

20:00.992 --> 20:03.785
and without that,
the war is lost.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.038
I didn't know I'd lose
my daughter over it.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.286
You've done enough.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.082
You should
walk away.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.584
You don't know
where you're going.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.670
So draw me a map.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.840
No.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.884
I'm in.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.098
OK.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.437
I need to get to the radio
so I can contact Clarke.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.855
We heard Jasper's SOS.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.107
I helped them set that up.
I know where it is.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.652
Bellamy...

21:18.861 --> 21:21.655
Your people
are disappearing,

21:21.864 --> 21:24.950
two so far--
Monty and Harper.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.284
I thought they'd be
in here, but--

21:26.494 --> 21:28.745
I want to see
the others now.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.622
The dorm is on the way
to the radio.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.582
OK.
Wait.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.211
Everyone here
knows everyone.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.881
Put this on.
Roll up your sleeve.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.886
Tracking chip.

21:47.598 --> 21:51.017
It'll trip alarms
once we start moving.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.852
We have to take
it out.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.813
Do it.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.779
How'd you know what my name
was before I told you?

22:04.532 --> 22:06.616
Clarke.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.702
Clarke said Jasper
couldn't stop talking

22:08.911 --> 22:11.621
about someone
named Maya.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.256
Put this
in your cage.

22:30.516 --> 22:34.936
I'll come back
for you, I promise.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.068
Take me to my friends.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.457
Please stop.
She's too weak.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.001
Don't. Don't.
Not again.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.587
No. No!

23:00.796 --> 23:02.380
No! No!

23:04.300 --> 23:06.051
Mr. president.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.803
Put that down.
Get away from that girl.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.348
Jasper.
Monty.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.516
Release him.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.312
Open it. Open it!

23:19.315 --> 23:21.232
I was so worried.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.822
The ground
is our birthright.

23:28.032 --> 23:31.618
You can't keep us
from that.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.705
Watch me.
Lock her up.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.457
Yes, sir.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.751
Go back to the dorm
and tell your friends

23:39.960 --> 23:41.252
to pack their things.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.546
You're going home.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.840
Thank you.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.051
Take me to my son.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.844
Yes, sir.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.650
Please answer
the question.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.985
Carl Emerson,

24:06.195 --> 24:07.404
Mount Weather
security detail.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.696
As you already said.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.157
You don't seem to be grasping
the situation here.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.954
You should've died
in the woods.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.789
We saved your life.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.252
Why not help us bring
an end to all this?

24:27.007 --> 24:28.883
Carl Emerson,

24:29.093 --> 24:31.219
Mount Weather
security detail.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.471
He's not gonna talk.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.348
He will
if we open the door.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.984
We are not doing that.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.069
We need to know
what he knows--

24:48.279 --> 24:51.948
vulnerabilities,
troop numbers.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.951
She's right.
Torture doesn't work.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.619
Clarke, it could
save your friends.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.787
I'm the chancellor.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.539
Then act like one.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.166
I told you I would
support you as long

25:01.375 --> 25:02.709
as I believed
that you were doing

25:02.918 --> 25:03.877
the right thing.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.587
I am,
and if you disagree,

25:05.796 --> 25:07.213
convene a vote
and take my place.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.300
I don't give a damn
about the title.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.177
I just want to save
our people.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.679
So do I.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.104
I want this man
under 24-hour guard.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.982
Is that clear?

25:42.249 --> 25:45.001
There are 382 people
inside this Mountain.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.419
If any of them realize
you're not one of us,

25:46.629 --> 25:48.671
you're dead.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.133
We're on level two.
The dorm is on five.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.177
There's a camera in the
upper right-hand corner.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.471
Keep your head down.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.684
Hold the elevator.

26:03.854 --> 26:06.147
Hey, Maya.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.483
You know, I missed you
in my expressionists class.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.485
Yeah. I--

26:10.694 --> 26:12.403
I had some
work to do.

26:12.613 --> 26:16.199
Ah. I'll get you
the notes.

26:46.897 --> 26:50.608
Hey, you're bleeding.
You OK?

26:50.818 --> 26:52.610
You were exposed.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.572
We need to retrace your steps
and find the breach.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.781
You better go.

26:56.991 --> 26:57.991
What about you?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.742
This is my job.
I'll be fine.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.120
Keep the
handkerchief.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.547
Eyes on
the ark camp, sir.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.507
Still no word
from Emerson?

27:14.717 --> 27:16.801
Uh-uh.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.387
There's
something wrong.

27:19.597 --> 27:24.142
The team at Tondc hasn't
checked in, either.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.770
Everything OK?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.773
Tell me Dr. Tsing
was working alone.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.612
I can't do that.

27:37.615 --> 27:40.283
We've accomplished
great things.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.201
You've accomplished
nothing.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.079
You're a stain
on our legacy.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.372
Our legacy?

27:46.582 --> 27:48.750
We've been
bleeding people

27:48.959 --> 27:51.169
to stay alive
for generations.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.504
That's our legacy.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.048
What we've done
is gonna get us

27:55.257 --> 27:57.216
out of this prison.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.219
How could you not
want that for us?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.639
You betrayed me.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.016
You betrayed us all.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.852
Take him into custody.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.733
I never wanted it
like this.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.819
All I wanted was to
give you your dream.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.989
I gave you an order.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.953
I'm sorry.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.791
They take their
orders from me now.

28:31.085 --> 28:34.170
Everyone wants to go
to the ground.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.172
You can't
blame them.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.800
Put my father
in quarantine.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.514
Yes, Mr. president.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.213
Yeah. I can totally replicate
this frequency.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.381
Good.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.716
If we can neutralize
the reapers,

29:19.925 --> 29:21.050
the tunnels
are an option.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.552
Get on it.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.845
You don't need to
give me orders, Clarke.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.054
I got this.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.473
Raven,
any word from Bellamy?

29:27.683 --> 29:28.683
Nothing yet.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.476
Lincoln
is still missing, too.

29:30.686 --> 29:31.686
He should be back
by now.

29:31.895 --> 29:32.854
They'll be OK.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.522
They better be.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.482
Your whole plan rests
on Bellamy getting in.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.151
He will.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.405
Counselor Kane
and Clarke Griffin,

29:42.614 --> 29:45.450
please report to
the South airlock immediately.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.744
We'll finish this later.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.041
Did he say something?

29:54.251 --> 29:56.252
No...

29:56.462 --> 29:58.421
But his blood did.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.840
Jackson found genetic
marker anomalies

30:01.049 --> 30:02.383
that can only come
from someone

30:02.593 --> 30:04.010
who was born on the ark.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.344
It's started.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.098
It didn't come from
the blood transfusion

30:09.308 --> 30:10.600
that we gave him?
No.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.809
I took the sample
before that.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.853
They're bleeding
my friends.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.521
We don't
know that.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.398
Yes, we do.

30:17.608 --> 30:21.110
We were genetically engineered.
They weren't.

30:22.780 --> 30:23.988
What are you doing?

30:24.198 --> 30:27.074
Killing him.
Get out of my way, Kane.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.035
Calm down.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.287
Clarke...

30:31.497 --> 30:34.582
You are not
in charge here.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.419
We do things my way.

30:50.516 --> 30:54.477
OK. Come along. Inside.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.106
Homeroom has now begun.

30:59.316 --> 31:02.568
All students should now be
in their classrooms.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.489
Come on.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.286
Mister...

31:12.496 --> 31:16.916
Are you on
a ground unit?

31:17.125 --> 31:20.378
My dad is training
for a ground unit.

31:22.965 --> 31:25.633
It's pretty cool up there.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.554
I hope he makes it.

31:48.699 --> 31:50.950
They're just kids.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.913
What did you expect
you'd find here?

31:56.123 --> 31:57.248
Who's gonna be
my helper?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.332
I want to help.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.584
Me! Me!

31:59.793 --> 32:02.587
All right.
Come up here.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.634
All right. Listen up.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.386
There's gonna be questions,
but there's no time.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.346
We're getting out of here.
So pack your stuff.

32:12.556 --> 32:13.639
What are you
talking about?

32:13.849 --> 32:17.143
What, they're just
letting us go?

32:17.352 --> 32:18.769
But, Jasper,
what the hell is going on?

32:18.979 --> 32:20.021
They lied to us
the whole time

32:20.230 --> 32:21.272
about everything.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.649
What?
What did they lie about?

32:23.859 --> 32:27.320
The ark is on the ground,
and we're not safe here.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.866
Do what he says.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.952
Now.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.675
There they are.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.806
No!

32:57.142 --> 32:58.768
What's going on?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.186
I don't know.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.313
It's not a breach,
but it can't be good.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.487
Get me
to that radio.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.710
Japser, on radio:
This is Jasper Jordan.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.170
We're too late.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.880
They're already
bleeding them.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.840
They've taken Harper,
and she may already be dead.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.717
We don't know
how much time we have left.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.344
It's over.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.388
No.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.057
You don't get
to give up, Clarke.

33:38.266 --> 33:41.477
You killed Finn,
and I didn't give up.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.437
I'm building a damn
tone generator.

33:43.647 --> 33:44.605
You do your job.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.023
What is my job?

33:46.233 --> 33:48.109
I don't know, to come up
with something.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.944
I have tried.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.487
Camp Jaha,
this is Mount Weather.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.989
Can anyone read me?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.824
Holy crap.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.076
Camp Jaha,
this is Mount Weather.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.787
Can anyone read me?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.123
Bellamy?

34:02.332 --> 34:04.417
Clarke?

34:08.296 --> 34:10.214
Are you all right?

34:10.424 --> 34:12.550
I'm fine.
That's it for the good news.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.219
We have to talk fast.
Something has changed.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.055
Jasper, Monty, everyone, they
just locked them in the dorm.

34:18.265 --> 34:21.017
But they're alive,
all of them?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.769
I think so, for now.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.688
Maya says that they're
already using their blood,

34:25.897 --> 34:29.066
and things are gonna get ugly
in here real fast.

34:29.276 --> 34:30.818
Maya is with you?

34:31.028 --> 34:34.989
She helped me escape.
If not for her, I'd be dead.

34:36.533 --> 34:40.077
And, Clarke,
there are kids in here.

34:40.287 --> 34:42.204
We need a plan
that doesn't kill everyone.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.040
Please tell me
we have one.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.083
I hear you,
but we can't do anything

34:46.293 --> 34:49.503
until you disable
the acid fog.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.005
Raven is gonna
help you.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.757
Got it.
What else?

34:52.966 --> 34:54.050
You have to
figure out a way

34:54.259 --> 34:56.052
to free the grounder
prisoners.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.012
There's a whole army
inside that Mountain,

34:58.221 --> 34:59.638
and they don't even
realize it.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.974
Trojan horse.
Good plan.

35:02.184 --> 35:06.353
What does Maya think?
Is it doable?

35:06.563 --> 35:10.191
She says
it's not a problem.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.568
Look. If I'm gonna
pull this off,

35:12.778 --> 35:14.737
I need you
to buy me some time.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.405
It won't be long before
they realize

35:16.615 --> 35:17.990
I don't belong here,
and if that happens--

35:18.200 --> 35:20.076
that can't happen.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.619
I'll come up
with something.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.245
Come up with it quick.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.414
Copy that,
and, Bellamy...

35:25.624 --> 35:27.583
Yeah?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.336
You came through.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.089
I knew you would.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.883
All I've done so far
is not get killed.

35:36.093 --> 35:41.138
Keep doing that.
You're up.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.974
What are you
gonna do?

35:44.184 --> 35:47.353
Gonna keep them looking
outside instead of in.

36:52.627 --> 36:56.213
Uh-uh.
Don't.

36:58.049 --> 37:02.011
Get dressed.
You're coming with me.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.648
They've got Emerson.

37:17.027 --> 37:20.112
Clarke, what
are you doing?

37:20.322 --> 37:21.822
Clarke, stop.
No.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.449
I'm letting
the prisoner go.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.409
Absolutely
not.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.119
He hasn't told us
anything yet.

37:27.329 --> 37:31.207
He doesn't have to.
He's gonna tell them something.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.250
Get the prisoner
back to the airlock now.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.044
Yes, ma'am.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.885
You may be the chancellor,
but I'm in charge.

37:47.015 --> 37:50.351
Indra, tell your
people to stand down

37:50.560 --> 37:53.354
before this
gets out of hand.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.190
No.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.613
People could
get hurt.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.783
Not if you get
out of my way.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.747
You need to trust that
I know what's right for us.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.090
The grounders
trust Clarke.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.886
Maybe we should, too.

38:36.398 --> 38:37.648
Stand down.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.285
Open the gate now.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.673
Can you hear me
all right?

39:02.882 --> 39:04.550
Because I need to make sure
you get this.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.344
Loud and clear.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.388
I have a message
for your leader.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.267
We're coming for him.

39:13.476 --> 39:17.021
You're watching us,
but you haven't seen a thing.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.024
The grounder army
is bigger than you think,

39:20.233 --> 39:22.318
and even if you
could find it,

39:22.527 --> 39:24.945
your acid fog
can't hurt them,

39:25.155 --> 39:27.156
and now, thanks to you...

39:29.784 --> 39:32.077
Neither can the reapers.

39:33.788 --> 39:37.374
So you have
one last chance.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.252
Let our people go,
and we'll let you live.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.546
It's just
that simple.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.715
I got it.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.305
It's an 8-hour walk
back to Mount Weather.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.733
You're gonna do it in 6.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.902
6 hours?
That's not enough.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.821
How am I supposed
to deliver your message?

40:08.031 --> 40:12.117
That's your problem.
Now go.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.460
Clarke.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.381
You want to explain to me
how this helps my brother?

40:25.590 --> 40:27.800
I just told him we
have a secret army

40:28.009 --> 40:29.385
to worry about.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.053
The more they're
looking at us,

40:31.262 --> 40:33.722
the less they're
looking at him.

40:33.932 --> 40:37.518
Bellamy is the key
to everything, Octavia.

40:37.727 --> 40:42.648
If he dies, we die.
