00:03.933 --> 00:06.300
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.300 --> 00:07.900
I HAPPENED TO MEET A GIRL

00:07.900 --> 00:10.300
WHO I THINK
YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.300
WAIT, A GIRL?

00:11.300 --> 00:13.567
HI. JAZZ.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.667
All: OH!

00:14.667 --> 00:15.933
Michaela:
I'M SEEING A LOT MORE

00:15.933 --> 00:18.633
OF JAZZ'S PERSONALITY BLOSSOM
WITH VICTORIA.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.233
DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A HIGH GPA

00:20.233 --> 00:21.667
AND ALL THAT STUFF?
YEAH.

00:21.667 --> 00:24.433
Jazz:
I AM DEFINITELY ATTRACTED
TO VICTORIA,

00:24.433 --> 00:28.267
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT VICTORIA
WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN, AS WELL.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.967
HEY!

00:29.967 --> 00:33.333
Jazz:
I MET LYNN ABOUT A YEAR AGO
AT THIS ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.267
SOMETIMES MY MOM,
'CAUSE SHE'S SUPER RELIGIOUS,

00:35.267 --> 00:37.600
SHE'LL TELL ME THAT, LIKE,
THERE'S A DEMON INSIDE OF ME.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.467
Jazz: SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE SUPPORT OF HER FAMILY.

00:39.467 --> 00:40.933
Dr. Marilyn:
WHAT'S STRESSFUL
ABOUT SCHOOL?

00:40.933 --> 00:42.567
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING
ABOUT SCHOOL.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.100
IT'S PROBABLY WHY
I GO IN MY ROOM

00:44.100 --> 00:45.567
AND SHELTER MYSELF.

00:45.567 --> 00:49.667
PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH STRESS
WILL COPE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

00:49.667 --> 00:52.033
SHE CHOSE FOOD.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.800
Dr. Charlton:
IF YOU'RE RUNNING A HIGHER BMI
THAN WE WANT,

00:54.800 --> 00:56.767
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO DO SURGERY,

00:56.767 --> 00:57.767
SO DON'T FORGET THAT.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.200
Jazz:
THERE'S NO EASY WAY

00:59.200 --> 01:00.800
TO HANDLE
THIS WEIGHT-LOSS THING,

01:00.800 --> 01:03.600
AND I'M WORRIED THAT I MIGHT BE
HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.300
THIS SURGERY IS ON THE LINE.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.167
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

01:10.167 --> 01:12.533
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.967
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.467
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.600
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.567
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.067
COME ON, JAZZ!
WHOO!

01:23.067 --> 01:25.500
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:25.500 --> 01:27.667
BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.533
I AM JAZZ.

GRABBING THE CART?

01:38.800 --> 01:41.067
Jeanette:
I'M GRABBING A CART.

01:41.067 --> 01:44.667
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I NEED
TO LOSE WEIGHT AND LOWER MY BMI

01:44.667 --> 01:46.633
IN ORDER TO GET
THE BOTTOM SURGERY.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.100
THAT'S SIX. OKAY.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.367
I WAS EATING HEALTHY,

01:49.367 --> 01:52.367
BUT THEN I FELL OUT
OF MY ROUTINE IN NEW YORK

01:52.367 --> 01:55.967
BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY
THE EPICENTER OF AMAZING FOOD.

01:55.967 --> 01:57.300
IT'S VERY BUSY
OVER THERE.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.400
LET'S START OVER THERE
WITH THE SPINACH AND KALE.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.933
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
LIKE SALAD ANYMORE.

02:00.933 --> 02:03.900
NO, NO. I LIKE --
I NEED SPINACH FOR MY SMOOTHIES.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.867
I'M A LITTLE BIT EAGER
TO GET BACK ON TRACK

02:05.867 --> 02:09.733
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF I
DON'T START LOSING WEIGHT NOW

02:09.733 --> 02:11.233
THAT WE'RE NEVER GONNA SET
A DATE,

02:11.233 --> 02:12.833
I'M NEVER GONNA GET
THE PROCEDURE DONE,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.067
AND, YOU KNOW,

02:14.067 --> 02:17.533
EVERYTHING I'VE HOPED FOR
ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

02:17.533 --> 02:19.367
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE AN APP ON MY PHONE

02:19.367 --> 02:21.267
THAT ACTUALLY SCANS
FOOD AND RATES IT.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.800
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
SCAN FOOD?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.833
I DO
WHEN I'M BEING HEALTHY.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.433
DARK-CHOCOLATE SNACKS.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.967
WAIT,
MAYBE THEY'RE HEALTHY.

02:27.967 --> 02:29.200
I DON'T CARE.
IT'S CHOCOLATE.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.267
WELL, IT'S THIN.
IT MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.167
NO, YOU'LL EAT
THE WHOLE BAG AT ONCE.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.400
A "C" MINUS --
THAT'S NOT TERRIBLE.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.433
NO, THAT'S AWFUL.

02:36.733 --> 02:38.600
DON'T GO FOR THE FOOD
SAMPLE. NOPE, NOPE.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.067
WELL, HOLD ON.
THIS IS A SMALL SAMPLE.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.133
EXTRA MATURE CHEDDAR.

02:43.133 --> 02:44.667
WHAT IS EXTRA MATURE?

02:44.667 --> 02:46.433
NO, ONE PER PERSON.
ALRIGHT.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.067
THAT'S MY TREAT.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.733
MY BIGGEST STRUGGLE,
WHEN IT COMES TO WEIGHT LOSS

02:51.733 --> 02:54.400
AND EATING HEALTHY
IS MY WILLPOWER.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.467
Jazz:

02:55.467 --> 02:56.700
LIGHT WHIPPED CREAM,

02:56.700 --> 02:59.467
ONLY 990 CALORIES
IN THIS WHOLE THING.

02:59.467 --> 03:03.367
SO DIVIDED BY 7 -- 141 CALORIES
OF WHIPPED CREAM EACH DAY.

03:03.367 --> 03:06.267
NO. IT'S A WASTE OF CALORIES.
JUST PUT IT BACK.

03:06.267 --> 03:09.067
Jeanette:
MY GOAL AT THE GROCERY STORE IS
NOT ONLY TO BUY HEALTHY FOODS,

03:09.067 --> 03:11.100
BUT TO GET JAZZ EXCITED.
LIKE, I WANT HER TO BE LIKE,

03:11.100 --> 03:12.700
"OH, YEAH. WE CAN COOK THIS.
WE CAN COOK THAT."

03:12.700 --> 03:14.367
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN THROUGH PHASES
WITH JAZZ

03:14.367 --> 03:16.067
WHERE SHE'S ON
HEALTHY EATING KICKS.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.967
LIKE, SHE WAS A VEGAN
FOR A WEEK, LIKE...

03:19.767 --> 03:21.567
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT
WE GET ALL THIS HEALTHY FOOD

03:21.567 --> 03:23.900
IN THE HOUSE, 'CAUSE THEN
WE'LL JUST HAVE HEALTHY STUFF.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.200
WHAT IF SANDER AND GRIFFEN
BRING IN FOOD?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.367
THEY'RE COMING BACK?
THEY'RE COMING HOME.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.367
BUT, LIKE, DON'T LET THEM
BRING IN BAD FOOD.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.667
WELL, THEY ALWAYS DO.
'CAUSE THEY CORRUPT ME.

03:32.667 --> 03:36.567
I AM NOT ABLE TO STOP MYSELF IF
A TEMPTATION IS RIGHT BEFORE ME.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.333
I ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE BITE.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.200
I CAN'T JUST PUSH IT ASIDE.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.300
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

03:42.300 --> 03:43.800
TO GO BACK
TO THE HYPNOTHERAPIST,

03:43.800 --> 03:46.467
BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE
TO RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS

03:46.467 --> 03:48.433
AND HAVE
EVEN STRONGER WILLPOWER.

03:48.433 --> 03:49.900
I THINK THE BEST
THAT YOU'VE DONE

03:49.900 --> 03:51.600
IS AFTER YOU SAW HER
THE LAST TIME.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.333
I'VE BEEN WANTING YOU
TO GO BACK.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.900
ALRIGHT, I'M TOTALLY
GONNA CALL HER.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.067
ALRIGHT. COOL.
DEFINITELY.

03:57.067 --> 04:07.067
**

04:07.067 --> 04:10.700
YOU PUT THIS BAG AWAY,
AND I'LL PUT THIS BAG AWAY.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.767
HERE, YOU WANT TO KEEP
THESE BAGS, RIGHT?

04:12.767 --> 04:15.067
I'LL PUT THEM
ON THE GROUND.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.067
WHO'S HOME?

04:16.067 --> 04:17.933
HELLO!

04:17.933 --> 04:19.667
AW!
HI, BABY.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.133
MWAH.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

04:24.833 --> 04:29.167
THE TWINS COME MARCHING IN,
AND THEY'RE LIKE PIG-PEN.

04:29.167 --> 04:31.133
LIKE, THERE'S THIS ODOR
AROUND THEM,

04:31.133 --> 04:33.067
AND I KNOW FRAT HOUSE ODOR,

04:33.067 --> 04:35.967
AND THIS IS
THE WORST FRAT HOUSE ODOR

04:35.967 --> 04:37.167
THAT I'VE EVER SMELLED.

04:37.167 --> 04:39.067
I'M WASHING CLOTHES FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA WASH.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.900
Griffen:
YOU GUYS HAVE DESTROYED
THE SNACK PANTRY.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.967
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.133
YEP.
YEAH.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.933
THAT'S CALLED
ME TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.167
WELL, HOW'S THAT
WORKING OUT?

04:46.167 --> 04:48.233
I MEAN, I'M LOSING
A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT,

04:48.233 --> 04:50.067
BUT, LIKE, AFTER GOING
TO NEW YORK,

04:50.067 --> 04:52.967
I GAINED SOME BACK, SO, LIKE,
I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.333
HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU
BEEN WORKING OUT?

04:54.333 --> 04:55.433
PRETTY OFTEN
WITH MY FRIENDS...

04:55.433 --> 04:56.600
...I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.367
THAT'S VERY VAGUE.
SO, LIKE, ONCE A WEEK?

04:58.367 --> 04:59.800
LIKE, FIVE DAYS A WEEK.
FIVE DAYS A WEEK?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.833
Jeanette: WHAT?! YOU DON'T
WORK OUT FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.067
YOU NEED TO BE
MORE ACTIVE.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.967
IT BURNS CALORIES.
YOU NEED TO BURN CALORIES.

05:05.967 --> 05:07.533
LET'S GO PLAY SOCCER
OUTSIDE.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.900
RIGHT NOW?
YEAH.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.167
LET'S GO BREAK
A SWEAT REAL QUICK.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.267
LET'S GET A WORKOUT IN --
BREAK A LITTLE SWEAT.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.633
HAVE FUN.
Griffen: FOLLOWING YOU.

05:13.633 --> 05:14.867
COME PLAY, MOM.

05:14.867 --> 05:16.633
THAT'S OKAY. I'LL PASS.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

05:16.633 --> 05:19.267
Griffen: MOTIVATING JAZZ
TO WORK OUT IS NOT EASY,

05:19.267 --> 05:22.100
BUT I DO KNOW THAT SHE
REALLY DOES LOVE SOCCER,

05:22.100 --> 05:23.733
SO KICKING THE BALL
AROUND WITH HER

05:23.733 --> 05:26.933
HOPEFULLY WILL MOTIVATE HER
TO CONTINUE TO STAY ACTIVE.

05:26.933 --> 05:30.167
Griffen: SHOW HIM WHAT'S UP!
SHOW HIM WHAT'S UP!

05:34.567 --> 05:36.400
DO YOU STILL GOT ALL THE SKILLS
YOU USED TO, JAZZ?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.267
OH, HELL TO THE YES.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.933
AAH!
ARE YOU SURE

05:40.933 --> 05:42.733
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FALLING OVER
THE BALL ALREADY.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.967
-NO, I'M NOT.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.400
WHY ARE YOU HOLDING
YOUR SIDE, THEN?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.667
Griffen: JAZZ USED TO BE
AN AMAZING ATHLETE.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.067
SHE WAS OFTEN THE BEST PLAYER
ON THE FIELD,

05:52.067 --> 05:53.800
AND I LOVED WATCHING HER PLAY.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.867
SEEING HER RIGHT NOW,
IT'S KIND OF SAD TO SEE.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.733
HOLD ON.
I'M TOO TIRED.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.100
Griffen: YOU'RE BREATHING
REAL HEAVY.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.433
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.233
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN RUNNING THE MOST.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.567
YOU'RE ALSO THE ONLY
ONE THAT JUST SAID
SHE NEEDS A BREAK.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.733
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
RUNNING CONSTANTLY,
AND YOU GUYS HAVEN'T.

06:10.733 --> 06:11.933
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
FOR 10 MINUTES.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.767
WELL, WHATEVER!
LOOK AT YOU AND LOOK AT ME!

06:13.767 --> 06:15.400
I'M A FAT ASS!

06:17.733 --> 06:19.933
MY BROTHERS ARE COMING DOWN
ON ME PRETTY HARSHLY,

06:19.933 --> 06:22.833
AND I THINK OVERALL THEY ARE
JUST VERY CONCERNED FOR ME

06:22.833 --> 06:25.467
AND WANT ME TO PUSH MYSELF
TO THE MAX

06:25.467 --> 06:27.633
AND REALLY LOSE ALL THIS WEIGHT.

06:27.633 --> 06:29.567
HOWEVER, I'M GONNA DO THIS
MY OWN WAY

06:29.567 --> 06:31.067
AND WHAT WORKS FOR ME,

06:31.067 --> 06:33.067
AND I FEEL LIKE
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:33.067 --> 06:35.367
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO BE LIKE THIS IN ONE DAY.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.333
-IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE ONE DAY.
-EXACTLY!

06:37.333 --> 06:38.767
IT'S GONNA BE
A GRADUAL PROCESS.

06:38.767 --> 06:40.067
SO THEN, WHY ARE YOU
UNDERMINING ME?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.067
OKAY, AND I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.167
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT
MY HELP, THEN FINE,
I WON'T HELP YOU.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.533
NO, I APPRECIATE
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP ME,

06:45.533 --> 06:47.133
BUT ARE YOU GUYS REALLY
TRYING TO HELP ME

06:47.133 --> 06:48.367
WHEN YOU COME HOME --

06:48.367 --> 06:50.367
"OH,
THERE'S NO GOOD SNACKS HERE.

06:50.367 --> 06:51.700
LET'S JUST BRING
UNHEALTHY FOOD."

06:51.700 --> 06:53.067
THAT'S ALL GRIFFEN.
GRIFFEN ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT FOOD.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.533
"LET'S JUST ORDER IN PIZZA."
I'M SORRY, I'VE NEVER HAD

06:54.533 --> 06:55.967
A PROBLEM WITH WEIGHT.
I'M SURE ONE DAY LATER,

06:55.967 --> 06:57.667
THERE'S GONNA BE FRENCH FRIES
IN THE FRIDGE.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.167
I'M SURE THERE ARE.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.400
Sander: JAZZ ISN'T
LIKE EITHER OF US.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.233
SHE DOES NOT LIKE
OUR FITNESS ADVICE.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.867
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
REALLY LIKE FITNESS,

07:03.867 --> 07:05.933
AND THEN SHE JUST
SEEMS TO THINK THAT,

07:05.933 --> 07:07.500
WHAT WORKS FOR US
WON'T WORK FOR HER,

07:07.500 --> 07:09.467
BUT YOU GOT
TO START SOMEWHERE.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.367
THE FOOD -- THAT'S
MY MAJOR WEAKNESS.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.767
YES, I DO THINK THAT EATING
IS YOUR WEAKNESS,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.267
BUT BEING LAZY
IS ALSO A WEAKNESS, TOO.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.633
YOU, LIKE, STAY IN YOUR ROOM
WATCHING TV,

07:17.633 --> 07:19.667
BEING ALONE, AND, LIKE,
THAT'S ANOTHER WEAKNESS.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.133
IT'S NOT JUST EATING.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.067
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO LOSE WEIGHT, AND YOU START,

07:23.067 --> 07:24.567
AND THEN YOU STOP,
AND THEN YOU START.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.100
YOUR UNDERLYING PROBLEM
IS YOURSELF.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.667
YOU DON'T LIKE
STICKING TO THINGS.

07:27.667 --> 07:31.567
EVEN IF I WORK OUT
AND EVEN IF I'M BEING ACTIVE,

07:31.567 --> 07:33.567
I STILL GO BACK
TO THAT JUNK FOOD.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.967
YOU CAN'T KEEP MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKES,

07:34.967 --> 07:36.200
WHICH IS WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.667
SO, GUYS,
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.333
I REALLY JUST DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.333
BUT --

07:40.333 --> 07:42.067
NO, IT'S REALLY
MAKING ME UPSET.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.367
THEY HAVE TO JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

07:44.367 --> 07:45.933
AND BE THERE TO SUPPORT,

07:45.933 --> 07:47.967
RATHER THAN FORCE ME
TO DO SOMETHING

07:47.967 --> 07:50.733
THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY
WANT TO DO.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.167
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE.

07:52.167 --> 08:01.067
**

08:01.067 --> 08:02.233
I LOVE
YOUR LITTLE BLOUSE.

08:02.233 --> 08:05.067
YEAH, I WAS LIKE,
"LYNN LOOKING CUTE TODAY."

08:05.067 --> 08:07.933
Jazz: I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS

08:07.933 --> 08:09.700
BECAUSE THEY MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.433
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE
THEM IN MY LIFE,

08:12.433 --> 08:14.467
AND THEY ARE JUST COOL PEOPLE.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.500
I MET LYNN ABOUT A YEAR AGO
AT THIS ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.467
SOMETIMES MY MOM,
'CAUSE SHE'S SUPER RELIGIOUS,

08:22.467 --> 08:25.400
SHE'LL TELL ME THAT, LIKE,
THERE'S A DEMON INSIDE OF ME.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.133
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN SO THANKFUL

08:27.133 --> 08:29.467
TO HAVE THE LOVE
AND SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.767
I WAS HOPING THAT BY NOW,

08:30.767 --> 08:33.333
LYNN'S FAMILY
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF HER

08:33.333 --> 08:37.100
AND WOULD BE ON HER SIDE,
HELPING HER WITH HER TRANSITION.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.767
HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE CASE,

08:38.767 --> 08:41.100
AND LYNN IS STILL ALONE
IN THIS JOURNEY,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.067
AND IT'S JUST VERY UNFORTUNATE.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.367
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?
YOU GOOD?

08:44.367 --> 08:45.667
LIKE, HALF THE TIME,
I'M NOT EVEN HOME,

08:45.667 --> 08:46.800
SO I'M JUST,
LIKE, WORKING.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.533
DO YOU, LIKE, PRESENT THERE,
OR DO THEY NOT KNOW?

08:49.533 --> 08:51.933
MY MANAGERS KNOW. I JUST
CAME OUT TO THEM A BIT AGO.

08:51.933 --> 08:54.233
SO, LIKE, I AM GONNA
PRESENT GRADUALLY AND MORE.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.733
THAT'S AWESOME.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

08:55.733 --> 08:57.433
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE GROWING OUT YOUR HAIR,

08:57.433 --> 08:58.767
AND IT WAS GETTING LONGER?
YEAH.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.500
WHY'D YOU CUT
YOUR HAIR AGAIN?

09:00.500 --> 09:01.800
IT'S HARD TO MAINTAIN.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.633
IT'S SO, SO MUCH EASIER
TO HAVE IT SHORT.

09:04.633 --> 09:08.933
IF I COULD PASS
WITHOUT HAVING LONG HAIR,

09:08.933 --> 09:11.200
I WOULD CUT IT OFF,
LIKE, SO QUICK.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.567
OH, I SEE JOJO!

09:12.567 --> 09:14.233
HI!
HEY!

09:14.233 --> 09:17.700
JOJO IS ONE OF MY NEW FRIENDS
THAT I MET AT THE MIXER.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.333
OH, YOUR HAIR
IS LIKE --

09:19.333 --> 09:21.500
IT'S MAKING A RUN FOR IT.
YEAH, IT IS.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.733
SHE'S TRANSGENDER, AS WELL,

09:22.733 --> 09:24.533
AND I WANT HER
TO MEET NOELLE AND LYNN

09:24.533 --> 09:26.467
BECAUSE I THINK
SHE'S A REALLY COOL PERSON,

09:26.467 --> 09:28.967
AND SHE JUST FITS IN WITH US.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.233
PSHOO!

09:30.233 --> 09:32.300
Noelle: SO, LIKE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,

09:32.300 --> 09:34.867
WHEN DID YOU COME OUT?

09:34.867 --> 09:38.267
I CAME OUT IN --
ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.433
DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW

09:39.433 --> 09:41.167
YOU WERE, LIKE, A GIRL?
MM-HMM.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.900
I WENT TO MY MOM
WHEN I WAS 2, AND
I ASKED HER IF --

09:43.900 --> 09:46.567
I WAS LIKE, "MOM, CAN I GO BACK
TO GOD AND CHANGE SUITS?"

09:46.567 --> 09:48.867
-WOW.
-IT WAS REALLY, REALLY COOL.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.933
MY MOM AND MY GRANDMA
ARE LIKE MY TWO PARENTS.

09:50.933 --> 09:52.400
THAT'S AWESOME.
I GREW UP WITH THEM.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.733
LIKE, THAT'S A NICE THING
TO HAVE, TOO,

09:53.733 --> 09:54.933
'CAUSE, LIKE, MOST PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE, LIKE,

09:54.933 --> 09:56.267
THE SUPPORT
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.867
LIKE MYSELF.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.567
IT'S, LIKE,
SORT OF A STRUGGLE

09:59.567 --> 10:01.233
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANYONE SUPPORTING
ME BESIDES MY FRIENDS.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.233
IT'S HARD. IT'S DIFFICULT.
YEAH.

10:04.233 --> 10:07.600
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE LYNN
FACING SO MANY STRUGGLES

10:07.600 --> 10:09.633
AND, YOU KNOW,
HAVING A HARD TIME

10:09.633 --> 10:12.433
FINDING THE LOVE AND SUPPORT
THAT SHE DESERVES,

10:12.433 --> 10:14.000
AND I JUST FEEL REALLY BAD

10:14.000 --> 10:17.200
AND WANT TO SUPPORT HER
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.233
Lynn:
MY MOM IS NOT EVEN WILLING
TO HELP ME WITH THE, LIKE,

10:19.233 --> 10:20.633
HORMONES IN GENERAL.

10:20.633 --> 10:22.833
I'VE HAD TO SCRAPE BY
WITH EVERYTHING THAT I, LIKE --

10:22.833 --> 10:24.400
I GET FROM MY PAYCHECK.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.300
Lynn:
MY MOM IS REALLY, LIKE, AGAINST,
LIKE, ME BEING TRANS

10:26.300 --> 10:27.967
'CAUSE SHE'S, LIKE,
REALLY RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT,

10:27.967 --> 10:30.000
AND SHE'S LIKE, "THIS
ISN'T RIGHT. THIS IS
NOT HOW GOD MADE YOU."

10:30.000 --> 10:31.733
AND NOT HAVING SUPPORT
FROM MY FAMILY,

10:31.733 --> 10:33.667
IT'S REALLY HARD,
'CAUSE I REALLY NEED THE HELP.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.867
I KNOW. I WANT YOU TO GET
THOSE HORMONES, THOUGH.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.000
THAT'S SO --
I KNOW, LIKE,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.967
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS
TO ALL OF US, AND...

10:38.967 --> 10:40.167
RIGHT.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.600
...I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.167
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING
WE COULD DO, LIKE,

10:44.167 --> 10:46.667
MAYBE, LIKE, A FUNDRAISER
OR SOMETHING FUN

10:46.667 --> 10:49.300
THAT COULD HELP RAISE MONEY
TO GET THOSE HORMONES.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.933
I'M DEFINITELY
WILLING TO DO THAT.

10:50.933 --> 10:52.433
I'M JUST TRYING
TO THINK.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.400
OH, YEAH, NO.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.800
WHAT ARE GOOD --
YANKEE CANDLE?

10:56.267 --> 10:58.533
"YOU WANT A CANDLE?"
YANKEE CANDLE, NO.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.900
APPLE CINNAMON?

11:00.900 --> 11:03.800
I FEEL REALLY TOUCHED
THAT JAZZ WOULD COME UP
WITH AN IDEA LIKE THAT,

11:03.800 --> 11:05.500
AND JUST KNOWING
THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE WHO CARES

11:05.500 --> 11:07.833
AND IS ABLE JUST TO BE LIKE,

11:07.833 --> 11:10.967
"LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER,"
IT MEANS A LOT.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.233
Noelle: ONE THING
A LOT OF, LIKE,

11:12.233 --> 11:14.433
ORGANIZATIONS DO WHENEVER
THEY NEED TO RAISE MONEY

11:14.433 --> 11:15.667
IS A CAR WASH.
CAR WASHES, YES!

11:15.667 --> 11:18.267
AND THOSE ARE USUALLY
SO, SO SUCCESSFUL.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.733
THAT SOUNDS FUN, TOO.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.767
Jazz:
I'M REALLY HAPPY AND EXCITED

11:21.767 --> 11:23.533
THAT LYNN AGREED
TO ACCEPT OUR HELP,

11:23.533 --> 11:26.533
AND I FEEL LIKE TOGETHER,
WE CAN RAISE THIS MONEY

11:26.533 --> 11:29.333
AND ALLOW LYNN TO CONTINUE
WITH HER TRANSITION

11:29.333 --> 11:32.167
AND SHOW HER THAT SHE DOES HAVE
THE SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.067
COME ON, LET'S START
PLANNING THIS, GIRLS!

11:34.067 --> 11:35.133
Lynn:
IS THERE GONNA BE FOOD?

11:37.533 --> 11:39.700
Jazz: OH, MY GOD!
WE HAVE ANOTHER CUSTOMER!

11:39.700 --> 11:40.800
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.267
YOU CALL THAT
A GOOD CAUSE?

11:42.267 --> 11:43.700
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHO YOU ARE.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.800
I MEAN, YOU'RE BORN A BOY
OR YOU'RE BORN A GIRL.

11:49.067 --> 11:53.267
**

11:53.267 --> 11:54.600
Jazz: ALRIGHT,
I WAS HANGING OUT

11:54.600 --> 11:55.800
WITH NOELLE
AND SOME OTHER FRIENDS,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.933
AND I'M EXCITED
ABOUT THIS CAR WASH

11:57.933 --> 11:59.533
THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD
FOR LYNN

11:59.533 --> 12:03.267
TO SUPPORT HER AND HELP HER
AFFORD THE HORMONES.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.667
MM-HMM.
I LIKE THE IDEA.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.233
I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE
OF YOU TO DO,

12:06.233 --> 12:08.800
AND I DON'T THINK LYNN
HAS EVER HAD ANYBODY

12:08.800 --> 12:10.200
DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS
FOR HER.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.133
I'VE DONE A LOT OF CAR
WASHES IN MY DAY,

12:13.133 --> 12:15.633
AND TO RAISE
ENOUGH MONEY FOR HORMONES

12:15.633 --> 12:17.133
IS GOING TO BE TOUGH.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.600
Jeanette:
SO, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT HYPNOTHERAPY?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.200
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM

12:21.200 --> 12:23.500
ISN'T ABOUT RUNNING
OR WORKING OUT.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.700
IT'S THE FOOD.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.800
AND MY GOAL IS THAT
THIS HYPNOTIST WILL HELP ME.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.333
I REALLY
AM COUNTING ON THIS.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.667
Jazz:
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO HELP ME WITH MY WEIGHT LOSS

12:33.667 --> 12:35.733
IN WAYS THAT ARE UNPRODUCTIVE,

12:35.733 --> 12:38.733
AND I AM GOING FOR ANOTHER
HYPNOTHERAPY APPOINTMENT

12:38.733 --> 12:40.767
BECAUSE THE FIRST
SESSION REALLY HELPED

12:40.767 --> 12:42.167
AND I SAW THE DIFFERENCE,

12:42.167 --> 12:44.633
AND I FEEL LIKE
SHE COULD CONTINUE HELPING ME

12:44.633 --> 12:46.067
TO MOVE FORWARD.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.067
WELL, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.333
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.100
I'M OKAY.
YES?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.200
GIVE ME SOME SORT
OF INSIGHTS, FEEDBACK

12:53.200 --> 12:54.500
AS TO WHAT
YOU EXPERIENCED

12:54.500 --> 12:56.333
AFTER HAVING
YOUR FIRST SESSION.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.400
FROM WHAT I RECALL,
I DID VERY WELL

12:58.400 --> 13:00.733
THE FIRST WEEK
AFTER THE SESSION.

13:00.733 --> 13:03.133
I JUST FELT VERY ON TRACK.
MM-HMM.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.567
I WAS EATING HEALTHY,
WORKING OUT,

13:05.567 --> 13:08.533
AND THEN
I WENT TO NEW YORK.

13:08.533 --> 13:09.500
OKAY.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.433
AND I ATE
A LOT OF UNHEALTHY FOOD,

13:11.433 --> 13:13.867
AND I CAME BACK HOME,
AND SINCE THEN,

13:13.867 --> 13:17.567
I'VE NEVER REALLY
FULLY BEEN BACK
TO WHERE I WAS.

13:17.567 --> 13:18.600
ALRIGHT.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.067
REMEMBER,
IT'S A PROCESS.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.967
I DO WANT TO...

13:21.967 --> 13:24.100
BE HEALTHY
AND FEEL BETTER.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.533
HOWEVER, I ALSO --
I'M NOT GONNA LIE --

13:26.533 --> 13:28.300
I DO LOVE FOOD,
AND I DO LOVE EATING,

13:28.300 --> 13:29.967
AND PART OF ME
ALMOST DOESN'T WANT

13:29.967 --> 13:31.900
TO LET THAT GO.
AH!

13:31.900 --> 13:35.433
AND I FEEL SATISFIED
IN THAT MOMENT AND COMPLETE.

13:35.433 --> 13:37.067
SO THE FOOD
IS A MEANS

13:37.067 --> 13:40.233
OF YOU GETTING TO THAT FEELING
OF FEELING GOOD.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.500
MM-HMM.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.967
Keli:
WHEN WE HAVE LEVELS
OF DISCOMFORT,

13:43.967 --> 13:46.933
WE REACH FOR THINGS
THAT GIVE US COMFORT.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.933
AS SHE HEALS,
IT WILL BE EASIER AND EASIER

13:49.933 --> 13:53.300
TO RELEASE THE EMOTIONS
AND THE BELIEF SYSTEM

13:53.300 --> 13:56.267
THAT'S DRIVING THAT BEHAVIOR.

13:56.267 --> 13:59.400
SO, WE'RE GONNA
BE RE-EDUCATING
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
TO HELP YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

14:01.400 --> 14:04.667
THAT YOU DON'T NEED THAT
FOR YOU TO FEEL GOOD.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.500
SO, WHAT WE CAN DO
IS EYE-MOVEMENT THERAPY,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.567
WHICH LITERALLY

14:09.567 --> 14:12.333
IS A PROCESS THAT BEGINS
TO REWIRE YOUR BRAIN.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.167
Keli:
AS WE KNOW, BINGE-EATING

14:14.167 --> 14:16.133
IS A SYMPTOM
OF AN EMOTIONAL STATE.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.533
THE REASON WHY I SUGGESTED
EYE-MOVEMENT THERAPY

14:18.533 --> 14:21.133
IS THAT IT CAN REWIRE YOUR BRAIN

14:21.133 --> 14:24.467
AND HELP YOU TO FEEL BETTER
IN A PRETTY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

14:24.467 --> 14:26.400
SO THAT, AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL,

14:26.400 --> 14:28.733
SHE CAN BEGIN
TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.600
CLOSING YOUR EYES DOWN

14:30.600 --> 14:33.200
AND JUST TAKING
A DEEP BREATH.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.933
IF YOU HAD TO GAUGE
THE FEELING OF FEELING LOST

14:36.933 --> 14:40.567
THAT ENCOMPASSES
FEELING FAILURE, WEAKNESS,

14:40.567 --> 14:43.267
HOPELESSNESS,
AND NEEDING TO ESCAPE,

14:43.267 --> 14:45.533
WHEN IT IS
THAT YOU BINGE,

14:45.533 --> 14:46.900
ON A SCALE
FROM ZERO TO 10 --

14:46.900 --> 14:49.133
10 BEING
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

14:49.133 --> 14:51.500
AND ZERO
BEING NOT AFFECTED,

14:51.500 --> 14:53.300
NOT BOTHERED AT ALL --

14:53.300 --> 14:56.667
WHERE WOULD YOU
GAUGE THAT FEELING?

14:56.667 --> 14:58.100
10.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.167
NOW YOU CAN
OPEN YOUR EYES.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.233
AND I WANT YOU
JUST TO LOOK HERE, OKAY.

15:02.233 --> 15:05.333
LOOK AT ME, AND I WANT YOU
TO JUST FOCUS ON MY FINGERS.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.067
AND NOW,
JUST CONNECTING

15:07.067 --> 15:09.300
WITH THAT FEELING
OF FEELING LOST

15:09.300 --> 15:12.567
AND THE NEEDING TO BINGE
TO ESCAPE AND FEEL BETTER,

15:12.567 --> 15:14.600
BUT JUST BY FOLLOWING
MY FINGERS,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.100
ALL OF THAT
IS SHIFTING AND CHANGING

15:17.100 --> 15:22.700
INTO FEELINGS OF FEELING
CONFIDENT, IN CONTROL.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.067
Jazz: I DEFINITELY
FEEL MYSELF RELAXING...

15:26.067 --> 15:28.700
BEING HOPEFUL,
BEING POSITIVE...

15:28.700 --> 15:32.067
...LISTENING
TO MY THOUGHTS MORE, OBSERVING.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.700
...FEELING LOVED
100%...

15:34.700 --> 15:37.400
THAT ALLOWS ME TO FEEL
MORE IN CONTROL OF MY BODY

15:37.400 --> 15:40.600
AND FEEL PRESENT
IN THE MOMENT.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.300
IT REALLY JUST
WAS ABLE TO CALM ME DOWN.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.067
...MOVING INTO A NEW,

15:46.067 --> 15:49.533
HEALTHIER CHAPTER
OF YOUR LIFE.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.700
AND JUST CLOSING
YOUR EYES DOWN, JAZZ.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.767
SO NOW, GOING BACK
TO YOUR NUMBER --

15:54.767 --> 15:56.433
YOUR NUMBER
WAS A 10 BEFORE.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.500
WHERE
IS THAT NUMBER NOW?

15:58.500 --> 16:01.333
LIKE A TWO.
MM.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.567
A TWO FEELS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN A 10, DOESN'T IT, JAZZ?

16:04.567 --> 16:05.667
MM-HMM.

16:05.667 --> 16:06.733
IF WE DID THAT,

16:06.733 --> 16:09.067
WE CAN MAKE IT
EVEN BETTER, CAN'T WE?

16:09.067 --> 16:11.300
MM-HMM.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
ABOUT HYPNOTHERAPY,

16:13.333 --> 16:16.300
BUT IT DEFINITELY
SEEMS TO BE HELPING ME.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.900
I FEEL LIKE AFTER THE SESSION,

16:17.900 --> 16:20.467
I GET THAT BOOST
AND FEEL ENERGIZED

16:20.467 --> 16:23.667
AND READY TO MOVE FORWARD,
PUSH MYSELF HARD

16:23.667 --> 16:26.100
UNTIL I COULD REACH MY GOALS.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.867
I JUST, LIKE, FORGOT
ABOUT ALL MY PROBLEMS.

16:28.867 --> 16:37.667
**

16:38.900 --> 16:41.600
COME ON IN!

16:41.600 --> 16:42.833
WHERE ARE YOU?

16:42.833 --> 16:44.767
* I'M IN THE KITCHEN! *

16:47.067 --> 16:48.367
HEY!

16:48.367 --> 16:49.533
HI.
I'M COOKING.

16:49.533 --> 16:50.967
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

16:50.967 --> 16:53.900
WELL, MAC AND CHEESE,
BUT IT'S ORGANIC MAC AND CHEESE.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.967
SO IT COUNTS TOWARDS
YOUR HEALTHY EATING?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.867
YES.

16:57.867 --> 16:59.067
PRETTY HEALTHY.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.233
THERE YOU GO.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.233
Jazz: I DEFINITELY THINK

17:01.233 --> 17:03.767
THE HYPNOTHERAPY SESSION
DID WORK,

17:03.767 --> 17:05.400
BECAUSE TODAY I'M COOKING

17:05.400 --> 17:09.133
HEALTHY, ORGANIC, WHOLE WHEAT,
BUTTER-FREE, MILK-FREE

17:09.133 --> 17:10.300
MAC AND CHEESE,

17:10.300 --> 17:11.733
AND WHILE IT'S NOT
SUPER HEALTHY,

17:11.733 --> 17:14.200
IT'S NOT, LIKE,
SOME COOKIES OR PIZZA,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.933
OR SOME OTHER JUNK FOOD,
YOU KNOW?

17:16.933 --> 17:18.833
SO, HOW ARE YOU?
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

17:18.833 --> 17:22.367
WE DIDN'T GET TO TALK AFTER
WE WENT GO-KARTING.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.400
OH, I KNOW.
THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.133
WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT VICTORIA?

17:27.133 --> 17:29.200
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE INTIMIDATED BY ME,

17:29.200 --> 17:31.267
OR OTHER TIMES, LIKE,
THEY JUST CAN'T HANDLE ME

17:31.267 --> 17:33.100
'CAUSE I'M TOO MUCH.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.300
WE'LL SEE.
WE'LL SEE.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.967
SHE WAS A REALLY COOL PERSON.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.567
AFTER MEETING VICTORIA,
I REALLY LIKED HER,

17:39.567 --> 17:42.467
AND I DEFINITELY WANT
TO HANG OUT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

17:42.467 --> 17:45.367
I REALLY THINK
SHE DUG YOU.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.700
YOU REALLY THINK SO?
I REALLY DO.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.067
SEE, I FEEL LIKE
SHE DIDN'T, THOUGH,

17:49.067 --> 17:51.600
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE, MAYBE.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.267
SHE'S TOTALLY
NOT OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

17:53.267 --> 17:54.800
YES, SHE IS.
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.133
SHE'S SO
NOT OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.533
SHE'S TOTALLY
IN YOUR LEAGUE.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.300
JAY AND I WERE SITTING THERE
THE WHOLE TIME,

17:59.300 --> 18:01.367
AND IT WAS, LIKE,

18:01.367 --> 18:03.067
IT WAS THIRD-
AND FOURTH-WHEELING.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.800
I GUESS I WOULD
HAVE TO HANG OUT
WITH HER AGAIN,

18:04.800 --> 18:06.467
BUT, LIKE, I REALLY DID THINK
SHE WAS AWESOME,

18:06.467 --> 18:09.333
AND I WOULD HANG OUT
WITH HER AGAIN IF
SHE'D BE WILLING TO.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.967
I'M JUST, LIKE,
NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH.

18:10.967 --> 18:12.833
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.633
I GET TO BE
THE LITTLE VOICE IN YOUR EAR

18:14.633 --> 18:16.700
TELLING YOU
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.400
FAIRY GODMOTHER.
DUH.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.467
THAT'S, LIKE, YOUR NICKNAME NOW.
YOU LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.333
I DO. I DO.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.633
I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.233
YAY!

18:25.233 --> 18:33.367
**

18:33.367 --> 18:34.867
Greg:
THIS IS NICE THAT WE'RE

18:34.867 --> 18:36.400
OUT FOR A LITTLE WALK.
Jeanette: WELL, WE NEED TO.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.433
WE ALWAYS SAY, "LETS GO
FOR A WALK," AND JAZZ
IS ALWAYS LIKE, "NO!"

18:39.433 --> 18:41.733
GREG IS ALWAYS ASKING JAZZ
TO GO FOR WALKS.

18:41.733 --> 18:43.367
YOU ALWAYS ARE.
"LETS GO FOR A WALK."

18:43.367 --> 18:46.333
SO, FINALLY, SHE SAID YES.
YOU GOT YOUR WALK IN.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.600
IT'S A POSITIVE STEP --
LITERALLY.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.867
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH YOU SOCIALLY?

18:50.867 --> 18:52.467
Jazz:
I WAS WITH MICHAELA AND JAY,

18:52.467 --> 18:55.567
AND WE WENT TO THIS
GO-KART/ARCADE PLACE,

18:55.567 --> 18:59.367
AND MICHAELA WANTED ME
TO MEET HER FRIEND VICTORIA,

18:59.367 --> 19:01.667
AND IT WASN'T
LIKE A DATE OR ANYTHING,

19:01.667 --> 19:04.800
BUT, LIKE,
THERE WAS STILL THAT LITTLE...

19:04.800 --> 19:06.667
TENSION OR THAT VIBE.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.300
GREG AND I
ARE VERY LIBERAL

19:08.300 --> 19:11.433
WHEN IT COMES TO DATING
AND SEXUALITY,

19:11.433 --> 19:14.333
AND I TOTALLY THINK
THAT CISGENDERED WOMEN

19:14.333 --> 19:17.267
ARE MUCH MORE OPEN
TO DATING TRANS PEOPLE.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.300
I REALLY LIKED HER A LOT.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.167
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S A NEGATIVE STIGMA

19:21.167 --> 19:24.833
ATTACHED TO MEN DATING
TRANSGENDER WOMEN

19:24.833 --> 19:27.767
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT
PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK
THAT THEY'RE GAY.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.167
SHE'S DATED
A LOT OF PEOPLE,

19:29.167 --> 19:31.333
SO SHE HAS
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE,

19:31.333 --> 19:33.667
AND THAT'S ONE THING
THAT WORRIES ME, YOU KNOW?

19:33.667 --> 19:35.700
WHEN I ASKED HOW MANY
RELATIONSHIPS SHE'S BEEN IN,

19:35.700 --> 19:36.967
SHE WAS GOING LIKE THIS.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.100
HER FINGERS JUST KEPT...
OH, GEEZ.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.600
...GOING AND GOING AND GOING.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.633
I JUST -- I DON'T WANT TO BE
ANOTHER FINGER ON HER HAND.

19:42.633 --> 19:44.167
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:44.167 --> 19:46.400
Jazz:
WHEN IT COMES TO DATING,
VICTORIA DEFINITELY HAS

19:46.400 --> 19:49.900
A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ME,
AND IT'S KIND OF INTIMIDATING.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.933
SOME PEOPLE ARE
LATE BLOOMERS,
AND IT'S OKAY,

19:51.933 --> 19:53.300
AND SOME PEOPLE
ARE NOT,

19:53.300 --> 19:54.967
AND THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.067
THE OLDER YOU GET,
THE MORE LIKELY

19:57.067 --> 19:59.200
PEOPLE ARE HAVE GONNA HAD
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.100
Jeanette:
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT JAZZ HAS A LITTLE CRUSH

20:02.100 --> 20:03.267
ON VICTORIA.

20:03.267 --> 20:06.233
JAZZ SUMS IT UP BEST,
SAYING SHE JUDGES PEOPLE

20:06.233 --> 20:07.867
BY THE CONTENT
OF THEIR CHARACTER,

20:07.867 --> 20:11.800
AND IF SHE SEES SOMEBODY
THAT HAS BEAUTIFUL CONTENT,

20:11.800 --> 20:14.467
THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'LL BE HAPPY WITH THEM.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.200
Jazz: I'M GLAD
THAT WE WALKED A BIT,

20:16.200 --> 20:19.100
AND I GOT MY CALORIES BURNED,
YOU KNOW?

20:19.100 --> 20:20.700
YEAH, YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING INTERESTING?

20:20.700 --> 20:22.133
WHAT?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.467
ME AND MOM WERE OUT
WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

20:24.467 --> 20:27.500
GRANDPA BROUGHT UP
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.533
WHAT IS IT?

20:28.533 --> 20:31.567
HE WANTED TO DO
A FAMILY SOCCER MATCH.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.100
INCLUDING HIM AND GRANDMA?

20:33.100 --> 20:36.000
HE WANTS TO SUPPORT
YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS
TO GET IN SHAPE,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.633
AND HE KNOWS THAT
YOU LOVE SOCCER AND --

20:38.633 --> 20:40.067
THEY'RE WILLING
TO GET OUT THERE.

20:40.067 --> 20:42.567
I'M SO DOWN FOR THIS
JUST TO SEE GRANDMA PLAY SOCCER.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.333
SO, HOW'S SCHOOL GOING --
YOUR FAVORITE PLACE TO BE,

20:46.333 --> 20:47.600
MY BRAINIAC CHILD?

20:47.600 --> 20:49.767
"BRAINIAC."
I DON'T KNOW.

20:49.767 --> 20:53.967
WHILE I APPRECIATE EDUCATION,
I DO NOT LIKE SCHOOL.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.733
I HAVE NEVER LIKED SCHOOL.

20:55.733 --> 20:58.700
IN THE PAST, I'VE
JUST HAD PROBLEMS
AROUND NEW PEOPLE.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.500
I'M GONNA FEEL LIKE
I'M THE ODD ONE OUT.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.667
DURING LUNCHTIME,
I EAT IN THE BATHROOMS

21:02.667 --> 21:04.200
'CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS
AT SCHOOL.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.667
Jeanette: COME ON. I KNOW
YOU'RE DYING TO GO TO SCHOOL.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.433
I'M TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT IT.
I'M JUST MISERABLE THERE.

21:12.433 --> 21:15.300
I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO MAKE A CHANGE IN MY LIFE.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.600
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

21:16.600 --> 21:19.833
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
VIRTUAL SCHOOL.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.067
YOU NEED TO BE
IN SCHOOL.

21:23.067 --> 21:26.133
I'M SORRY, BUT, LIKE,
SCHOOL IS SCHOOL.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.867
JAZZ HAS BEEN UNHAPPY
WITH SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

21:28.867 --> 21:31.233
BUT EVERY YEAR,
WE ALWAYS GET THROUGH IT.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.667
YOU JUST HAVE TWO YEARS.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.967
Jeanette:
TO ME, LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL
IS LIKE DROPPING OUT,

21:35.967 --> 21:38.567
AND SHE NEEDS STRUCTURE.

21:38.567 --> 21:41.200
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO BE UNHAPPY FOR TWO YEARS.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.767
DON'T YOU THINK A
LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL
KIDS FEEL THAT WAY?

21:43.767 --> 21:46.967
YEAH, AND I'M SURE
THEY DO, BUT A LOT
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS

21:46.967 --> 21:50.267
DON'T HAVE
THE ADDED PRESSURE THAT I DO.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.067
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A REGULAR CHILD.

21:53.067 --> 21:55.667
I LIVE A VERY STRESSFUL LIFE
FOR A TEENAGER,

21:55.667 --> 21:58.833
AND FOOD IS SOMETHING
THAT I JUST FIND COMFORT IN.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.267
IT'S STRESS-EATING,

22:00.267 --> 22:04.133
AND I'VE BEEN BINGE-EATING MORE
SINCE THE SCHOOL YEAR,

22:04.133 --> 22:06.567
AND I FEEL LIKE, WITH EVERYTHING
GOING ON IN MY LIFE,

22:06.567 --> 22:10.167
VIRTUAL SCHOOL WILL
DEFINITELY ALLEVIATE
A LOT OF MY STRESS.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.400
I VISITED MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
THE OTHER DAY.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.267
I KNOW I DIDN'T REALLY TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS,

22:14.267 --> 22:17.800
BUT SHE WAS SAYING THAT I COULD
GO TO THIS VIRTUAL SCHOOL

22:17.800 --> 22:21.367
WHERE I COULD JUST FINISH
MY HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.900
THE FACT THAT JAZZ HAS
TAKEN IT UPON HERSELF

22:23.900 --> 22:26.467
TO GO TALK TO
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,

22:26.467 --> 22:29.267
JEANETTE AND I ARE BOTH
DEFINITELY TRIPPED UP.

22:29.267 --> 22:31.933
I REALLY THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD TRY

22:31.933 --> 22:34.300
TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL
IN SCHOOL.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.500
HEY, I'M JUST PUTTING IT
OUT ON THE TABLE

22:36.500 --> 22:38.933
THAT RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT SURE
IF I'M HAPPY IN MY LIFE,

22:38.933 --> 22:41.067
AND I JUST WANT
A BIG CHANGE.

22:41.067 --> 22:43.233
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU MAY SAY NO

22:43.233 --> 22:45.267
OR WHY
YOU MAY BE HESITANT,

22:45.267 --> 22:47.300
BUT IT'S ONLY FAIR
IF YOU AT LEAST CONSIDER IT

22:47.300 --> 22:48.867
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

22:48.867 --> 22:53.700
**

22:53.700 --> 22:56.067
I CAN'T EVEN SPEAK.
I CAN'T.

22:56.067 --> 22:59.067
I NEVER PICTURED THIS
IN HER FUTURE.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.533
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.667
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

23:07.367 --> 23:09.933
**

23:11.100 --> 23:13.067
Jazz: COME IN!

23:13.067 --> 23:14.133
HEY!

23:15.200 --> 23:16.300
HEY.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.867
HEY.
* HI! *

23:17.867 --> 23:21.067
Jazz:
LYNN, NOELLE, AND JOJO
ARE MEETING ME AT MY HOUSE

23:21.067 --> 23:23.800
TO MAKE POSTERS
FOR THE CAR-WASH FUNDRAISER.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.633
YOU WANT TO SEE THE UGLIEST
POSTER EVER

23:25.633 --> 23:27.967
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PRETTY.
NO ONE CARES.

23:27.967 --> 23:29.833
Noelle: SO,
$10 IS THE PRICE?

23:29.833 --> 23:32.600
THE GOAL FOR THE CAR WASH
IS GONNA BE TO RAISE $1,000,

23:32.600 --> 23:34.933
AND I THINK THAT'S
A VERY ATTAINABLE GOAL.

23:34.933 --> 23:37.600
$1,000? THAT MEANS
WE HAVE TO WASH 100 CARS.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.500
LET'S DO IT.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.800
CAN SOMEONE
GET STARTED?

23:39.800 --> 23:41.333
'CAUSE WE GOT
SOME WORK TO DO.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.667
Jazz:
IT'S REALLY INTIMIDATING
KNOWING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN

23:43.667 --> 23:44.700
THAT MUCH WORK AND TIME

23:44.700 --> 23:46.467
IN ORDER TO RAISE
THIS MUCH MONEY.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.933
HOWEVER, HOPEFULLY, WE WILL GET
SOME DONATIONS TO HELP US OUT.

23:49.933 --> 23:51.400
IT'S LIKE -- THE FACT THAT
WE'RE, LIKE, COMING TOGETHER

23:51.400 --> 23:54.067
IN SUCH A WAY JUST, LIKE,
SO YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME,

23:54.067 --> 23:54.967
IT MEANS A LOT.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.300
YEAH.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.800
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEED TO THANK US FOR.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.167
LIKE, THIS IS OUR
JOB AS YOUR FRIENDS

24:01.167 --> 24:03.200
TO HELP YOU OUT,
HELP YOU BE HAPPY.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.433
AND HORMONES, ESPECIALLY,
ARE SUPER, SUPER IMPORTANT.

24:07.433 --> 24:09.767
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.
WE GOT YOU.

24:09.767 --> 24:13.100
TRANSITIONING CAN DEFINITELY BE
AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS,

24:13.100 --> 24:14.733
AND WHILE $1,000

24:14.733 --> 24:18.167
MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO COVER
ALL OF THE MEDICAL EXPENSES,

24:18.167 --> 24:20.467
IT WILL GIVE HER THAT BOOST
SHE NEEDS

24:20.467 --> 24:23.400
IN ORDER TO FEEL HOPEFUL
IN THIS PROCESS.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.967
I JUST SPELLED
"HORMONES" WRONG.

24:24.967 --> 24:25.967
NO,
YOU DIDN'T.

24:25.967 --> 24:28.067
YEP.
FORGOT THE "E."

24:28.067 --> 24:30.433
"HORMONS"!

24:30.433 --> 24:33.633
WHEN LYNN IS FINALLY ABLE
TO AFFORD HORMONES,

24:33.633 --> 24:35.933
SHE WILL BE BECOME HAPPIER
BECAUSE SHE'LL KNOW

24:35.933 --> 24:38.267
THAT SHE IS FINALLY
UNDERGOING THE PROCESS

24:38.267 --> 24:40.067
THAT SHE'S BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO.

24:40.067 --> 24:42.400
ALSO, THE PHYSICAL CHANGES
ARE PRETTY NICE.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.367
I CAN SAY THAT FROM EXPERIENCE.

24:44.367 --> 24:47.300
AND I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.433
OH, MY GOD.
WE SUCK AT LIFE.

24:49.433 --> 24:51.833
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT GIRL YOU MET?

24:51.833 --> 24:53.267
VICTORIA?

24:53.267 --> 24:55.733
MICHAELA SAID
THAT SHE'S INTO ME.

24:55.733 --> 24:57.300
LIKE, SHE THINKS
I'M PRETTY, BUT, LIKE...

24:57.300 --> 24:58.367
MICHAELA
SAID THAT?

24:58.367 --> 25:00.433
YEAH, 'CAUSE
MICHAELA KNOWS HER,

25:00.433 --> 25:01.833
AND, LIKE,
I REALLY THOUGHT

25:01.833 --> 25:04.067
SHE WAS VERY,
VERY CUTE, SO...

25:04.067 --> 25:06.267
OOH! GET IT, JAZZ!
YES!

25:06.267 --> 25:08.967
MICHAELA IS DEFINITELY
PLAYING MATCHMAKER A LITTLE BIT.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.933
YOU KNOW, SHE'S HELPED
TO MOVE THINGS ALONG

25:10.933 --> 25:13.600
WHEN IT COMES TO
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH VICTORIA,

25:13.600 --> 25:16.067
AND SHE'S ALREADY SET UP
A SECOND HANGOUT.

25:16.067 --> 25:19.533
SO I'M JUST GLAD TO HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE HER ON MY SIDE.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.233
IS THIS POSTER, LIKE,
FLASHY ENOUGH?

25:21.233 --> 25:22.933
Jojo:
THAT IS ADORABLE.

25:22.933 --> 25:24.700
JOJO'S IS CUTE,
TOO.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.800
SHE GOT
THOSE LITTLE STICKERS.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.200
AND THEN, TRY NOT TO GET
GLITTER EVERYWHERE,

25:29.200 --> 25:31.067
BUT THERE'S MINE.

25:31.067 --> 25:32.833
OH, THAT'S JUST TRAGIC.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.733
**

25:40.733 --> 25:42.267
Greg: WE GOT
TO SPEND SOME TIME

25:42.267 --> 25:46.167
TALKING ABOUT
THIS SCHOOL DECISION.

25:46.167 --> 25:48.567
I ALWAYS PICTURED
HER GRADUATING,

25:48.567 --> 25:50.600
GIVING HER
VALEDICTORIAN SPEECH,

25:50.600 --> 25:54.200
YOU KNOW, THE TRADITIONAL
CAP AND GOWN.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.167
I'M SAD THAT JAZZ
WANTS TO LEAVE SCHOOL.

25:56.167 --> 25:59.200
I NEVER PICTURED THIS
IN HER FUTURE.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.167
I GUESS I'M OLD-SCHOOL
ABOUT SCHOOL.

26:01.167 --> 26:04.133
LIKE, YOU GO, YOU'RE IN
A BRICK-AND-MORTAR BUILDING,

26:04.133 --> 26:06.667
YOU DO YOUR 13 YEARS,
YOU GRADUATE.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.467
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT'S GONNA BE.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.667
I JUST DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF HER

26:10.667 --> 26:11.933
NOT BEING IN SCHOOL.

26:11.933 --> 26:15.067
YOU KNOW, I'M OPPOSED TO HER
LOCKED UP IN HER BEDROOM,

26:15.067 --> 26:17.667
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE CAN DO
HOMEWORK FROM HER BED

26:17.667 --> 26:19.700
AND SHE CAN GO TO CLASSES
FROM HER BED.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.100
MY FEAR IS, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GONNA BE HOME

26:22.100 --> 26:24.600
AND IT'S GONNA BE
REALLY EASY TO SLACK OFF.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.167
SHE COULD FALL PREY TO JUST
HANGING OUT IN HER ROOM,

26:27.167 --> 26:30.533
DAY IN AND DAY OUT,
BINGE-WATCHING TV AND EATING

26:30.533 --> 26:33.300
AND BECOMING
MORE AND MORE UNHEALTHY.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.167
THERE NEEDS TO BE
STRUCTURE IN HER LIFE.

26:35.167 --> 26:37.067
YOU AND I KNOW THAT,
AND SO...

26:37.067 --> 26:38.533
I CAN'T PROVIDE
HER STRUCTURE.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.700
I CAN'T PROVIDE HER
WHAT SCHOOL DOES

26:40.700 --> 26:42.233
EIGHT HOURS A DAY
EVERY DAY.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.567
I HAVE A LIFE, TOO.
I HAVE THINGS I HAVE TO DO.

26:44.567 --> 26:48.333
YEAH, IT'S GONNA --
IT'S GONNA AFFECT YOU.

26:48.333 --> 26:50.700
I WILL, IF JAZZ DECIDES
TO DO THIS,

26:50.700 --> 26:53.733
HAVE A NEW JOB
WHERE I HAVE TO BE,

26:53.733 --> 26:56.700
LIKE, THE BAD COP
AND GET ON HER,

26:56.700 --> 26:58.267
AND, "HAVE YOU DONE YOUR WORK?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

26:58.267 --> 27:03.967
IT JUST TAKES ON A WHOLE NEW
FLAVOR AND LIFESTYLE FOR ME.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.133
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

27:07.067 --> 27:10.467
I CAN'T EVEN SPEAK.
I CAN'T.

27:10.467 --> 27:12.500
THIS IS NOT HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO,

27:12.500 --> 27:15.867
AND I WASN'T PREPARED
FOR THIS.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.167
AND THIS
IS MY LIFE, TOO.

27:18.167 --> 27:22.367
NOBODY ASKED ME
OR CARED HOW THIS AFFECTS ME.

27:22.367 --> 27:25.167
AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S OKAY EVERY DAY,

27:25.167 --> 27:27.633
AND IT'S GONNA BE
DRAINING.

27:27.633 --> 27:30.600
YOU KNOW, I'M
NOT GONNA FORCE HER TO GO,

27:30.600 --> 27:31.833
BUT THIS IS HARD.

27:31.833 --> 27:35.167
IT'S REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY HARD...

27:37.900 --> 27:39.600
...I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

27:42.333 --> 27:44.533
PART OF BEING A MOM
IS DEFINITELY PUTTING

27:44.533 --> 27:46.533
YOUR CHILD'S NEEDS
BEFORE YOUR OWN.

27:46.533 --> 27:49.967
IF THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR JAZZ,
GOING TO VIRTUAL SCHOOL,

27:49.967 --> 27:54.900
THEN I WILL GO WITH IT,
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF WORRIES.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.767
Greg: IT HAS
LONG-TERM REPERCUSSIONS,

27:56.767 --> 28:00.433
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO RUSH INTO THIS IDEA,

28:00.433 --> 28:02.700
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I HAVE TO ASK --

28:02.700 --> 28:04.800
COULD BEING SO UNHAPPY
AT SCHOOL

28:04.800 --> 28:06.867
ACTUALLY BE
PART OF JAZZ'S ISSUES

28:06.867 --> 28:08.100
WITH HER EATING HABITS?

28:08.100 --> 28:09.900
SHE'S GOT
DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON,

28:09.900 --> 28:12.800
SO I'M ENTERTAINING
THIS IDEA.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.900
**

28:17.900 --> 28:19.400
Jack: AND WHAT
ARE YOU WEARING, JAZZ?

28:19.400 --> 28:20.733
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

28:20.733 --> 28:22.900
"PIZZA ROLLS,
GENDER ROLES"

28:22.900 --> 28:24.833
AND JAZZ ROLLS.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.667
THE JENNINGS CUP WAS OVER
BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN.

28:31.333 --> 28:37.667
**

28:37.667 --> 28:39.633
Jacky: OH,
THAT'S A FULL FIELD?

28:39.633 --> 28:41.567
Jack: I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS A LITTLE SMALLER.

28:41.567 --> 28:42.800
THIS IS FOR US.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.067
I WANT THIS ONE.
YAY, YAY.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.567
CAN THEY MAKE IT
THE SIZE OF A DOG CAGE?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.233
I DON'T KNOW.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.367
Jazz:
MY WHOLE FAMILY IS MEETING UP
FOR THE FAMILY SOCCER MATCH

28:50.367 --> 28:52.133
THAT MY GRANDPA CAME UP WITH

28:52.133 --> 28:55.367
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO HAVE EVERYONE COME TOGETHER

28:55.367 --> 28:57.500
TO HELP ME LOSE WEIGHT
AND BE ACTIVE.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.733
* HEY, EVERYBODY,
WE'RE HERE *

28:59.733 --> 29:01.300
OH!

29:01.300 --> 29:03.067
OH, MY GOD, GRANDMA.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

29:03.067 --> 29:05.867
MY GYM OUTFIT.
WE DON'T APPROVE?

29:05.867 --> 29:07.567
NO, NO, I GUESS
IT WORKS. IT WORKS.

29:07.567 --> 29:09.667
AND WHAT
ARE YOU WEARING, JAZZ?

29:09.667 --> 29:11.067
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

29:11.067 --> 29:12.633
"PIZZA ROLLS"...
"NOT GENDER ROLES."

29:12.633 --> 29:15.500
..."GENDER ROLES,"
AND JAZZ ROLLS.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.100
Jazz: SO, I'M WEARING THIS SHIRT
THAT SAYS,

29:17.100 --> 29:18.800
"PIZZA ROLLS, NOT GENDER ROLES,"

29:18.800 --> 29:21.833
AND OBVIOUSLY HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO JOKE AROUND AND BE FUNNY,

29:21.833 --> 29:22.900
BUT ALL I HEARD WAS

29:22.900 --> 29:24.400
"JAZZ ROLLS, JAZZ ROLLS,
JAZZ ROLLS."

29:24.400 --> 29:26.633
SO, WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF
THOSE JAZZ ROLLS.

29:26.633 --> 29:27.967
OH, MY GOD.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.833
Greg:
I JUST ACTUALLY THOUGHT
THE JENNINGS CUP

29:30.833 --> 29:32.733
WAS OVER BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN.

29:32.733 --> 29:34.567
Jazz: THAT WAS
A DISTASTEFUL JOKE,

29:34.567 --> 29:36.133
BUT YOU'RE LUCKY
I DON'T CARE.

29:36.133 --> 29:39.067
THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY
THE NICEST THING TO SAY.

29:39.067 --> 29:41.067
HOWEVER, I DON'T WANT TO
MAKE IT A BIG DEAL

29:41.067 --> 29:43.667
AND RUIN THIS ENTIRE
FAMILY SOCCER DAY,

29:43.667 --> 29:47.300
AND I JUST WANT TO MOVE PAST IT
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.167
I THOUGHT IT WAS
APPROPRIATE AND CLEVER,

29:49.167 --> 29:50.833
BUT I DO APOLOGIZE.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.833
Jack: THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I LIKE TO OPERATE.

29:53.833 --> 29:57.300
I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE TO MAKE
FUN OF PEOPLE'S BODY PARTS.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.067
Griffen: GRANDPA AND JAZZ,
YOU GUYS SHOULD PICK TEAMS.

29:59.067 --> 30:00.133
Sander: WHY DON'T WE JUST
DO THESE AS THE TEAMS?

30:00.133 --> 30:01.500
HOW ABOUT JUST DO THIS?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.667
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
ME AND THE LADIES!

30:03.667 --> 30:05.833
ALRIGHT, WE'RE STARTING
THIS GAME OFF!

30:05.833 --> 30:07.700
GRANDMA!

30:07.700 --> 30:09.400
YEAH!
GRANDMA!

30:09.400 --> 30:11.500
NO, GRANDMA, OUR TEAM!
WRONG TEAM!

30:11.500 --> 30:12.933
GRANDMA, GRANDMA,
GRANDMA!

30:12.933 --> 30:15.033
HOW DO YOU FEEL
BEING OUT ON A SOCCER FIELD,

30:15.033 --> 30:17.800
SINCE YOU'VE NEVER DONE
ANY SPORTS AT ALL BEFORE,

30:17.800 --> 30:19.133
OTHER THAN BOWLING?
RIDICULOUS.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.733
AND LISTEN,
FOR THE LOVE OF THE FAMILY,

30:20.733 --> 30:22.500
I'M GIVING IT
TRULY MY BEST SHOT.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.967
Jeanette: TAKE OUT ARI!

30:23.967 --> 30:26.367
MY GRANDMA IS A FISH OUT OF
WATER ON THE SOCCER FIELD.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.067
AAH!
Jazz: SCORE!

30:28.067 --> 30:29.933
Griffen: GOAL!
GOOD JOB, GRANDMA.

30:29.933 --> 30:32.167
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE BEING
OUTSIDE DURING SOCCER GAMES.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.767
SHE HAS TO STAY IN THE CAR
TO WATCH

30:33.767 --> 30:35.333
SO THAT HER HAIR
DOESN'T GET RUINED

30:35.333 --> 30:36.767
AND SHE DOESN'T SWEAT,

30:36.767 --> 30:38.167
SO THE FACT THAT
SHE'S PARTICIPATING

30:38.167 --> 30:39.800
JUST IS REALLY AWESOME.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.933
Sander: GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!
Greg: IT'S THE WRONG WAY!

30:41.933 --> 30:43.100
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT HERE.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.133
JACK, TO YOUR WIFE!

30:44.133 --> 30:45.733
Jack: TO YOU?
YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

30:45.733 --> 30:47.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.433
Greg: JEANETTE,
JUST SHOOT, JUST SHOOT.

30:48.433 --> 30:49.767
RELAX, RELAX, RELAX.

30:49.767 --> 30:50.800
I CAN'T SHOOT!
HOLD ON. RELAX.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.167
I CAN'T! I CAN'T!
STOP, STOP.

30:52.167 --> 30:54.367
Jeanette: I GOT NERVOUS,
AND I KIND OF CHOKED.

30:54.367 --> 30:57.333
I WAS OUT THERE, AND I REALLY
WANTED TO DO MY BEST,

30:57.333 --> 31:00.867
AND I WANTED TO SHOW THAT I HAD
SOME GRAIN OF ATHLETICISM

31:00.867 --> 31:02.600
SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN

31:02.600 --> 31:04.833
AND, LIKE,
JUST TO AIR A BALL LIKE THAT

31:04.833 --> 31:07.133
WAS NOT A GOOD FEELING.
I FELT SO STUPID.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.400
Greg: DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.833
MOST PEOPLE
ARE NOT GREAT ATHLETES.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.433
I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE SHOWN I HAD SOMETHING.

31:11.433 --> 31:12.667
I TRIED.

31:14.933 --> 31:16.300
Griffen: OH, JAZZ!

31:16.300 --> 31:18.500
Jeanette:
JAZZ LOOKS FANTASTIC
OUT ON THE FIELD.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.200
ALL THE MOVES ARE THERE.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.333
SHE'S EVEN
GOING FAIRLY QUICK

31:23.333 --> 31:26.067
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT
A LITTLE EXTRA WEIGHT ON HER.

31:26.067 --> 31:28.767
YOU KNOW, ME, I JUST LOOK AT HER
LIKE, "WOW. SHE'S GREAT.

31:28.767 --> 31:30.833
I MADE THAT PERSON."

31:30.833 --> 31:32.067
Jazz: YOU GOT ME ON...
Griffen: GO DOWN THERE!

31:32.067 --> 31:33.233
AAH!
Greg: OH, THAT'S TROUBLE.

31:33.233 --> 31:34.767
JAZZ!
OH, GEEZ.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.467
YES! YES!
Griffen: GOOOOAAAALLL!

31:36.467 --> 31:37.833
IN BETWEEN THE LEGS!

31:37.833 --> 31:39.900
Greg:
JAZZ DRILLED A SHOT PAST ME,

31:39.900 --> 31:42.067
AND I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.667
I GOT BEAT,
AND IT WAS A REALLY GOOD SHOT,

31:44.667 --> 31:48.267
AND I COULD SEE IT IN HER EYES,
THE COMPETITIVE JUICES FLOWING.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.333
I JUST KNEW
THAT IF JAZZ WANTED TO,

31:50.333 --> 31:51.700
SHE COULD PICK UP THE SPORT
ANY DAY.

31:51.700 --> 31:52.700
SORRY.

31:54.233 --> 31:55.367
Jacky: COME ON.

31:55.367 --> 31:56.467
Griffen: KEEP RUNNING,
KEEP RUNNING!

31:56.467 --> 32:00.067
YEAH! THAT'S BEAUTIFUL!
YES!

32:00.067 --> 32:01.333
BEAUTIFUL.
Greg: NICE SHOT.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.500
NO, THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.900
Sander: IT WAS AWESOME
TO PLAY AGAINST HER

32:03.900 --> 32:06.767
JUST LIKE WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
AND SHE PLAYED VERY WELL.

32:06.767 --> 32:09.233
SHE'S STILL
PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

32:09.233 --> 32:11.367
Jacky: YES!
BEAUTIFUL!

32:11.367 --> 32:13.800
KNOWING THAT MY ENTIRE FAMILY
HAS MY BACK

32:13.800 --> 32:15.633
JUST MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

32:15.633 --> 32:18.133
I'M GLAD THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO ALL PLAY TOGETHER,

32:18.133 --> 32:19.333
AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA

32:19.333 --> 32:20.567
GOT TO PLAY SOCCER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

32:20.567 --> 32:21.933
YOU'RE NOT RUSTY.

32:21.933 --> 32:23.233
Jeanette:
JAZZ, YOU'RE AMAZING.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.833
YOU JUKED HIM OUT.
YOU JUKED HIM OUT...

32:24.833 --> 32:26.467
SHE WAS ON MY TEAM!
...AND YOU JUKED HIM OUT.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.867
I KNOW, BUT SHE WAS STILL...
HOW'D SHE JUKE ME OUT?

32:28.867 --> 32:31.633
Greg:
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO HAVE
THE WHOLE FAMILY TOGETHER

32:31.633 --> 32:32.767
TO ENCOURAGE JAZZ.

32:32.767 --> 32:34.067
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS,

32:34.067 --> 32:36.267
WE'RE REALLY ALL TOGETHER
FOR THE COMMON CAUSE,

32:36.267 --> 32:38.433
WHICH IS TO LOVE EACH OTHER

32:38.433 --> 32:39.967
AND TO HELP JAZZ
IN THIS JOURNEY.

32:39.967 --> 32:42.867
CAN WE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE
THE MVP...

32:42.867 --> 32:45.067
AS GRANDMA!

32:47.067 --> 32:57.067
**

32:57.067 --> 32:58.767
**

32:58.767 --> 33:01.133
Noelle:
OKAY, I GOT THE DONATION BOX.

33:01.133 --> 33:04.333
TODAY IS THE DAY
OF THE CAR WASH,

33:04.333 --> 33:06.467
AND I'M JUST GLAD
TO HAVE A WHOLE TEAM

33:06.467 --> 33:08.500
READY TO SUPPORT LYNN
AND RAISE MONEY

33:08.500 --> 33:10.200
TO HELP LYNN
WITH HER TRANSITION.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.900
HOW MUCH ARE WE
TRYING TO RAISE,
LIKE, MONEY

33:11.900 --> 33:13.933
$1,000, BOO.

33:13.933 --> 33:16.433
$1,000.
THAT'S A LOT.

33:16.433 --> 33:18.367
IS THE HOSE
EVEN ON?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.900
I'M SO SORRY,
NOELLE.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.467
Noelle:
I THINK LYNN IS REALLY LUCKY
THAT SHE HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS

33:25.467 --> 33:27.700
WHO ARE LIKE-MINDED
AND WILLING TO HELP HER.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.867
I THINK THAT SUPPORT CAN GO
A LONG WAY IN HER TRANSITION,

33:30.867 --> 33:33.800
AND IT CAN REALLY HELP HER
REACH HER GOAL OF HAPPINESS.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.200
WE GOT THIS!
WHOO! YES!

33:35.200 --> 33:37.100
I HAVE FAITH IN US.
WE GOT THIS!

33:37.100 --> 33:38.067
WHOO!
COME ON!

33:38.067 --> 33:40.700
YAY!

33:40.700 --> 33:43.400
Jazz: WE HAVE A CUSTOMER?
Jojo: WE DO.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.133
ALRIGHT.
HERE YOU GO.

33:45.133 --> 33:46.533
YOU'RE THE FACE.

33:46.533 --> 33:47.667
HELLO.

33:47.667 --> 33:50.133

BUT WE ALSO ACCEPT DONATIONS,

33:50.133 --> 33:52.300
AND YOU CAN STAY
IN THE CAR IF YOU WANT.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.367
HERE'S $10.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.833
THANK YOU.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.067

OH, THANK YOU!

33:56.067 --> 33:58.500
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

33:58.500 --> 34:00.067
Friends: WHOO!

34:00.067 --> 34:02.200
ALRIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
MAKE YOUR CAR EXTRA CLEAN NOW.

34:03.233 --> 34:10.833
**

34:10.833 --> 34:12.600
Jojo: OH, MY GOD!
IT'S MY MOM!

34:12.600 --> 34:13.733
NO WAY.
YOUR MOM'S HERE?

34:13.733 --> 34:14.833
YEAH.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.233
HEY!
HI.

34:16.233 --> 34:17.700
IT COSTS $10.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.233
BUT IT'S A $50.
OH, THANK YOU F--

34:19.233 --> 34:20.833

34:20.833 --> 34:23.700
YES! $50 DONATION!
OH, MY -- LYNN,

34:23.700 --> 34:25.200
WHOO!
MY MOM GAVE $50.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.533
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

34:26.533 --> 34:27.967
-WHOO!
-WHOO!

34:27.967 --> 34:30.633
IT JUST MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
TO SEE EVERYONE COME TOGETHER

34:30.633 --> 34:32.067
TO SEE LYNN HAPPY

34:32.067 --> 34:34.800
AND ALLOW HER TO BE THE PERSON
THAT SHE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.700
Jazz: OH, MY GOD!
WE HAVE ANOTHER CUSTOMER!

34:37.700 --> 34:39.567
EVERYBODY,
THIS IS MY DAD.

34:39.567 --> 34:41.300
HELLO!
HEY!

34:41.300 --> 34:42.933
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.

34:42.933 --> 34:44.333
AND HE WANTS US
TO WASH HIS CAR.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.600
AWESOME.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.933
THANK YOU!

34:46.933 --> 34:49.867
Jazz: IT'S SO GREAT
THAT WE ARE GETTING DONATIONS

34:49.867 --> 34:52.633
AND RAISING MONEY QUICKER
FOR THIS GOOD CAUSE,

34:52.633 --> 34:54.500
AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE
WE COULD REACH THE GOAL

34:54.500 --> 34:55.967
OF $1,000.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.567
SO, THIS IS FOR YOU.
MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.

34:58.567 --> 34:59.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

34:59.700 --> 35:03.200
BE THE BEST PERSON
YOU CAN BE -- SERIOUSLY.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.667
THIS IS FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.300
I WISH YOU THE BEST.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.867
IT MEANS SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.

35:08.867 --> 35:11.067
**

35:11.067 --> 35:12.633
SO, WE SHOULD START
STARTING, RIGHT?

35:12.633 --> 35:14.967
IT'S STILL, LIKE --
I STILL REALLY CAN'T PROCESS IT

35:14.967 --> 35:17.467
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, SO
MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING
TOGETHER JUST TO HELP ME.

35:17.467 --> 35:19.267
USUALLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T HELP ME IN MY LIFE.

35:19.267 --> 35:20.933
I USUALLY HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS
JUST BY MYSELF

35:20.933 --> 35:22.567
NOT HAVING SUPPORT
FROM MY FAMILY.

35:22.567 --> 35:25.800
TO THINK SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD
HELP ME JUST BLOWS MY MIND.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.767
Jazz:
GUYS, WE'VE REACHED $250!

35:32.767 --> 35:33.733
WHAT?
WHOO!

35:33.733 --> 35:35.500
WE'RE 1/4 THERE!
WHOO!

35:35.500 --> 35:38.200
JAZZ, I THINK WE HAVE
ANOTHER CUSTOMER.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.600
Jazz: HELLO!
Lynn: HELLO. WELCOME.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.733
I SAW YOU'RE DOING
A CAR WASH.

35:40.733 --> 35:41.933
YEAH.
YES.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.467
WHAT ARE
THE DONATIONS FOR?

35:43.467 --> 35:44.767
IT'S FOR
MY FRIEND LYNN HERE.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.767
SHE'S TRANSGENDER,
AND WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY

35:46.767 --> 35:49.933
FOR HER HORMONES,
SO IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

35:49.933 --> 35:52.333
YOU CALL THAT
A GOOD CAUSE?

35:52.333 --> 35:54.067
WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT
HER DOING THAT?

35:54.067 --> 35:55.433
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

35:55.433 --> 35:56.867
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHO YOU ARE.

35:56.867 --> 35:59.067
I MEAN, YOU'RE BORN A BOY
OR YOU'RE BORN A GIRL.

36:03.533 --> 36:05.100
HELLO!
HI.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.433
WHAT ARE
THE DONATIONS FOR?

36:06.433 --> 36:07.867
IT'S FOR
MY FRIEND LYNN HERE.

36:07.867 --> 36:09.700
SHE'S TRANSGENDER,
AND WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY

36:09.700 --> 36:12.867
FOR HER HORMONES,
SO IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

36:12.867 --> 36:14.533
YOU CALL THAT
A GOOD CAUSE?

36:16.933 --> 36:19.833
I MEAN,
YOU'RE BORN WHO YOU ARE.

36:19.833 --> 36:21.933
Noelle:
YEAH, AND SHE WAS BORN
AS A TRANS GIRL.

36:21.933 --> 36:23.633
YEAH, SHE'S BORN AS LYNN.
NO, SHE WAS --

36:23.633 --> 36:24.733
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

36:24.733 --> 36:26.167
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHO YOU ARE.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.833
I MEAN, YOU'RE BORN A BOY
OR YOU'RE BORN A GIRL.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.800
Jazz:
HEARING THIS JUST MAKES ME
SUPER UPSET.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.933
LIKE, IF YOU DON'T
SUPPORT US, FINE,

36:32.933 --> 36:34.367
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

36:34.367 --> 36:36.400
YOU COULD JUST LEAVE AND GO
AND NOT GET YOUR CAR WASHED.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.733
THAT'S OKAY.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.967
BUT THE FACT THAT HE'S
JUST SPREADING HIS NEGATIVITY --

36:39.967 --> 36:42.100
LIKE, GET OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS NOT WANTED.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.300
WE ARE JUST LIVING OUR LIVES
AS WHO WE ARE,

36:44.300 --> 36:45.667
WE LOVE OURSELVES,
WE EMBRACE WHO WE ARE,

36:45.667 --> 36:47.167
AND WE WISH...
YOU DON'T LOVE WHO YOU ARE.

36:47.167 --> 36:48.867
...THAT YOU COULD
EMBRACE US, TOO.

36:48.867 --> 36:51.067
YOU WERE BORN A CERTAIN
WAY, AND YOU DON'T LOVE
HOW YOU WERE BORN, APPARENTLY.

36:51.067 --> 36:52.433
DON'T TELL ME
IF I DON'T LOVE MYSELF,

36:52.433 --> 36:54.067
'CAUSE I KNOW
WHO I LOVE, NOT YOU.

36:54.067 --> 36:55.633
YOU DON'T,
BECAUSE YOU CHANGED.

36:55.633 --> 36:57.100
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WELCOME...

36:57.100 --> 36:58.767
I THINK I SHOULD GO, TOO.
...HERE AT THIS CAR WASH...

36:58.767 --> 37:00.300
AND I WOULDN'T GIVE
MY MONEY, ANYWAY.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.367
...'CAUSE THIS IS A COMMUNITY
EMBRACING LOVE,

37:02.367 --> 37:03.700
AND YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO GIVE LOVE.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.700
Jojo:
WE LOVE OURSELVES!

37:05.700 --> 37:08.433
I'M SO USED TO HATE
AND JUDGMENT AT THIS POINT,

37:08.433 --> 37:11.400
IT DOESN'T EVEN FAZE ME,
BUT IT DOES HURT ME TO SEE

37:11.400 --> 37:13.433
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE
ARE AFFECTED BY HATE.

37:13.433 --> 37:15.400
THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT DOES GET TO ME.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.200
Jazz:
WE'RE RAISING MONEY.
WE'RE DOING GOOD,

37:17.200 --> 37:19.367
AND THAT PERSON IS NOT HERE
TO DAMPEN OUR DAY.

37:21.267 --> 37:22.300
OOP!

37:24.633 --> 37:26.733
Jazz: WE ARE GONNA HAVE
A GREAT TIME ONCE AGAIN,

37:26.733 --> 37:30.600
AND I FEEL LIKE LYNN JUST KNOWS
THAT THE POSITIVITY AND LOVE

37:30.600 --> 37:33.933
IS STRONGER THAN THIS ONE GUY
WHO IS SAYING HATEFUL THINGS.

37:33.933 --> 37:35.533
ALRIGHT, SO,
WE TOTALED IT OUT.

37:35.533 --> 37:37.833
IT WAS A TOTAL
OF 780 BUCKS.

37:37.833 --> 37:39.633
WE DIDN'T MAKE $1,000,
BUT WE DID A GREAT JOB,

37:39.633 --> 37:41.233
AND I'M REALLY
PROUD OF OURSELVES.

37:41.233 --> 37:43.067
I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS
FOR, LIKE, DOING THIS FOR ME.

37:43.067 --> 37:45.600
IT MEANS A LOT, LIKE,
MAKING THIS GOAL.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.267
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE,

37:47.267 --> 37:48.933
WITH THIS MONEY,
I CAN FINALLY BE ABLE TO,

37:48.933 --> 37:50.167
LIKE, DO THINGS
I REALLY NEED TO DO.

37:50.167 --> 37:51.700
YES!

37:51.700 --> 37:52.967
-YO, GROUP HUG.
-GROUP HUG!

37:52.967 --> 37:54.933
LYNN! WHOO!
Lynn:

37:54.933 --> 38:04.267
**

38:04.267 --> 38:05.733
Jazz: DO YOU GUYS WANT
TO SIT OVER THERE?

38:05.733 --> 38:06.767
Jay: SURE.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.133
Michaela: THIS IS GONNA BE
A CHALLENGE.

38:08.133 --> 38:10.300
I THINK RIGHT HERE
IS PERFECT.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.067
LET'S GET
THE TOWEL OUT.

38:12.067 --> 38:15.200
LAST TIME I SAW VICTORIA
WAS AT GO-KARTING,

38:15.200 --> 38:17.300
AND I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME WITH HER.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.367
I THOUGHT THAT WE COULD
REALLY BE GOOD FRIENDS

38:19.367 --> 38:21.600
OR MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING
MORE THAN THAT.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.567
HEY!

38:22.567 --> 38:24.067
HEY.
HEY.

38:24.067 --> 38:27.067
AND NOW WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE OUR
SECOND HANGOUT, AT THE BEACH.

38:27.067 --> 38:28.467
Victoria:
GIRL, IT'S WINDY.

38:28.467 --> 38:31.133
THIS NEEDS TO GET AWAY
FROM MY FACE.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.267
YOU HAVE A PONYTAIL HOLDER
RIGHT THERE.

38:32.267 --> 38:34.400
THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT CUTE.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.333
NOT CUTE? OKAY.
THAT'S NOT CUTE.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.433
Jay:
YOUR HAIR DOESN'T LOOK BAD,
THOUGH. IT LOOKS NICE.

38:38.433 --> 38:40.567
AW, THANKS.
I TRY.

38:40.567 --> 38:41.833
BEACH HAIR.

38:41.833 --> 38:44.200
VICTORIA IS
A REALLY AWESOME PERSON,

38:44.200 --> 38:46.833
AND I'D LIKE TO HANG OUT
WITH HER ONE-ON-ONE.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.400
I JUST FEEL LIKE
ME AND HER ALONE

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
WOULD ALLOW ME
TO FURTHER DIVE INTO

38:51.400 --> 38:52.733
WHO SHE IS AS A PERSON,

38:52.733 --> 38:54.733
AND WE COULD SEE
WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.433
WAIT, SO, IS THAT, LIKE,
A REAL TATTOO OR IS IT --

38:56.433 --> 38:58.567
YEAH, IT'S REAL.
WHAT IS IT?

38:58.567 --> 39:00.267
IT'S A FIBONACCI SPIRAL,

39:00.267 --> 39:01.933
WHICH IS, LIKE,
THIS THING IN MATH.

39:01.933 --> 39:03.233
YOU KNOW
"THE GREAT WAVE,"

39:03.233 --> 39:04.967
THE ART PIECE THAT'S,
LIKE, JAPANESE,

39:04.967 --> 39:06.333
AND THERE'S, LIKE,
A WAVE LIKE...

39:06.333 --> 39:07.900
...LIKE THAT?
OH, YEAH.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.600
THAT FOLLOWS THE SAME SHAPE,
SO IT'S COOL

39:09.600 --> 39:10.967
'CAUSE I LIKE ART
AND I LIKE SCIENCE.

39:10.967 --> 39:13.067
DID YOU SAY YOU LIKE ART
AND SCIENCE AND NOT MATH?

39:13.067 --> 39:14.267
I SUCK AT MATH.

39:14.267 --> 39:15.600
OH. SEE,
I'M THE OPPOSITE.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.467
I'M REALLY GOOD AT MATH,
BUT I HATE MATH.

39:17.467 --> 39:19.067
I WISH I WAS GOOD AT MATH.
BUT I LOVE ART AND SCIENCE.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.067
YEAH. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU WANT A TATTOO?

39:21.067 --> 39:22.333
OH, HELL TO THE YES.

39:22.333 --> 39:23.833
I WANT IT TO BE LIKE
WHAT MICHAELA HAS.

39:23.833 --> 39:25.667
SHE HAS ONE
GOING DOWN HER BODY.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.533
AND THEN I WANT, LIKE,
ONE ON MY BACK.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.167
YOU SEE THIS PATCH, LIKE,
WITH CATS RIGHT THERE,

39:31.167 --> 39:32.433
THE YIN

39:32.433 --> 39:33.700
I MIGHT DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

39:33.700 --> 39:35.100
BUT WITH KILLER WHALES
'CAUSE THEY LOOK --

39:35.100 --> 39:37.433
KILLER WHALES LOOK LIKE
THE YIN-YANG SIGN,

39:37.433 --> 39:40.067
AND THEY REALLY ARE,
LIKE, HARMONIOUS AND
PEACEFUL CREATURES

39:40.067 --> 39:41.767
'CAUSE THEY LIVE
IN THEIR, LIKE, PODS,

39:41.767 --> 39:44.200
AND THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.
KILLER WHALES.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.600
NO, THEY'RE NOT KILLERS!

39:45.600 --> 39:48.267
Victoria: HANGING OUT WITH JAZZ
IS SUPER NATURAL TO ME.

39:48.267 --> 39:49.467
YOU CAN, LIKE,
KID AROUND WITH HER,

39:49.467 --> 39:51.600
AND SHE'LL UNDERSTAND,
WHICH IS AWESOME.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.633
A DUCK WALK.
LET'S TRY DUCK TALK.

39:59.067 --> 40:01.200
I SAID "HELLO."
THAT WAS SO BAD, BRO.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.433
OH, MY GOD, NO.
THAT'S AWFUL.

40:03.433 --> 40:05.500
Jazz: I'M NOT SURE IF SHE FEELS
LIKE WE'RE CONNECTING

40:05.500 --> 40:08.100
OR IF SHE THINKS THAT
THIS SITUATION IS AWKWARD.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.400
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING
THROUGH HER HEAD,

40:10.400 --> 40:13.400
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL,
SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO GUESS

40:13.400 --> 40:16.167
THAT SHE LIKES ME
AND THAT SHE --

40:16.167 --> 40:18.367
I DON'T EVEN KNOW!
MY HEAD IS EVERYWHERE.

40:18.367 --> 40:20.233
WELL,
I REALLY HAVE TO PEE,

40:20.233 --> 40:21.867
SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS
TO VENTURE WITH ME

40:21.867 --> 40:23.533
TO TRY AND FIND A BATHROOM...
IT'S SO FAR.

40:23.533 --> 40:25.200
YOU GUYS GOT TO GO?
Michaela and Jay: YEAH.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.033
Jazz:
WHEN MICHAELA AND JAY SAY THAT
THEY NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

40:28.033 --> 40:30.000
I BASICALLY JUST ROLL MY EYES.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.433
I FEEL LIKE IT'S SO OBVIOUS
THAT THEY ARE TRYING

40:32.433 --> 40:36.200
TO SET VICTORIA AND I UP
AND HAVE US TALK ONE-ON-ONE,

40:36.200 --> 40:39.133
AND
THEY'RE JUST SO LAME.

40:39.133 --> 40:40.400
OH, NO,
I CAN'T LAY DOWN

40:40.400 --> 40:43.200
OTHERWISE, I'M, LIKE,
LITERALLY A BEACHED WHALE.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.533
NO, THAT'S AWFUL.

40:44.533 --> 40:45.733
I AM A BEACHED WHALE.

40:45.733 --> 40:46.900
NAH, DEFINITELY NOT.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.300
RIGHT NOW
IS THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY

40:49.300 --> 40:52.133
I WILL HAVE TO ASK VICTORIA OUT
IN PERSON,

40:52.133 --> 40:55.767
AND I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS MOMENT.

40:55.767 --> 40:58.333
UM...I HAD
A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU

40:58.333 --> 41:00.833
AT, UM, GO-KARTING.

41:02.733 --> 41:05.767
YEAH, IT WAS FUN, BUT...

41:05.767 --> 41:07.500
UM...WOULD YOU WANT
TO HANG OUT AGAIN --

41:07.500 --> 41:08.900
JUST, LIKE,
YOU AND ME?

41:08.900 --> 41:13.467
**

41:13.467 --> 41:14.767
YEAH, FOR SURE.
DEFINITELY.

41:14.767 --> 41:16.300
IT COULD BE FUN.
YEAH.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.300
I AM HONESTLY
JUST SO ECSTATIC.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.333
I WAS AFRAID OF BEING REJECTED,

41:20.333 --> 41:22.567
AND I'M JUST HAPPY
TO GET TO KNOW HER MORE,

41:22.567 --> 41:25.167
AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING GOOD
COULD COME OUT OF THIS.

41:25.167 --> 41:28.100
I FEEL LIKE HER FRIENDSHIP
IS REALLY MEANINGFUL TO ME,

41:28.100 --> 41:30.433
AND HOPEFULLY, IT COULD LEAD
TO SOMETHING EVEN BIGGER,

41:30.433 --> 41:34.300
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,
A ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP.

41:34.300 --> 41:40.300
**

41:40.300 --> 41:42.433
NEXT TIME ON "I AM JAZZ"...

41:42.433 --> 41:45.300
I JUST NEED TO LOSE ANOTHER
20 MORE POUNDS.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.933
Keli:
TODAY, WE'RE GONNA
SWITCH UP A BIT.

41:46.933 --> 41:48.800
WE'RE DOING SOME
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.067
Keli:
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION,

41:50.067 --> 41:52.067
IT'S AN ACCELERATED HEALING
OPPORTUNITY.

41:52.067 --> 41:54.967
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN
CONNECT SOME DOTS,

41:54.967 --> 41:57.067
WHAT HAS BEEN FUELING
HER BINGE-EATING.

41:57.067 --> 41:59.267
I DON'T THINK
MY FAMILY WANTS ME.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.900
HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

42:00.900 --> 42:03.133
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE ANYMORE.

42:03.133 --> 42:04.867
WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT VIRTUAL SCHOOL.

42:04.867 --> 42:06.300
I THINK IT WOULD
ALLEVIATE

42:06.300 --> 42:07.933
A LOT OF THE STRESS
AND PRESSURE.

42:07.933 --> 42:10.067
IT'S ALMOST LIKE EVERYTHING
I DO IN MY LIFE

42:10.067 --> 42:11.300
IS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.233
I'M REALLY JUST TRYING
TO DO THINGS FOR MYSELF

42:13.233 --> 42:14.967
JUST SO I CAN BE HAPPY.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.200
SHE'S HURTING.

42:17.867 --> 42:18.867
I JUST GOT A TEXT.

42:18.867 --> 42:20.933
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S VICTORIA!

42:20.933 --> 42:22.267
SHE SAID,
"I'LL PICK YOU UP."

42:22.267 --> 42:23.433
THAT'S AWESOME!

42:23.433 --> 42:25.433
I FEEL LIKE VICTORIA
WOULD BE THE TYPE OF GIRL

42:25.433 --> 42:26.633
WHO WOULD MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

42:26.633 --> 42:28.100
I'M GONNA HOLD BACK
AND LET HER DO IT.

42:28.100 --> 42:29.233
Jazz:
I REALLY LIKE HER.

42:29.233 --> 42:31.533
I REALLY HAVE HOPE
FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP.
