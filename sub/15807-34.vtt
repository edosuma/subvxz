<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
       <i> Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:06.304
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.373 --> 00:08.473
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.542 --> 00:10.943
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:11.011 --> 00:13.144
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:13.213 --> 00:15.480
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.549 --> 00:17.749
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.818 --> 00:20.285
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.353 --> 00:25.657
¶ For a three hour tour
    A three hour tour ¶

00:27.461 --> 00:29.895
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.964 --> 00:31.864
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.932 --> 00:34.399
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.468 --> 00:36.902
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.971 --> 00:39.237
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:39.306 --> 00:41.406

01:40.300 --> 01:41.700
I wonder who painted this.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.604
Skipper. Professor.
      Mr. Howell.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.676
Not guilty.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.511
Thurston, it's certainly
vaguely familiar.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.113
How come nobody admits
          to painting it?

01:55.182 --> 01:57.749
Skipper, Ginger, Professor,
     Mary Ann, they all deny it.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.983
Can you blame them?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.552
There's no doubt,
but it's abstract.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.188
- It's ridiculous.
       - It's scary.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.824
Nincompoopers!
       It's upside down.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.372
Now, look.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.641
It's painting, not on me.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.676
- Who are you?
         - I am Dubov.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.512
What are you doing
              on this island?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.915
First thing tell you
to get off.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.583
Thurston,
it is impossible.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.219
Well, it's incredible,
    but it is entirely possible.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.687
Of course, it's possible.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.590
Taking boat
and Dubov waving goodbye.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.158
No, no. You don't understand.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.927
We're considering the
        possibility that you are

02:41.996 --> 02:45.163
the Alexandri Gregor Dubov.

02:45.231 --> 02:47.832
Is there another
Alexandri Gregor Dubov

02:47.901 --> 02:49.000
in whole world?

02:49.069 --> 02:50.969
- Hardly.
        - Then I am me.

02:51.037 --> 02:55.173
Now, Dubov turn around,
  count three, everybody gone.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.776
[counting in Russian]

02:59.947 --> 03:02.347
- Everybody still here.
 - Of course, we're still here.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.516
Don't you see, we're shipwrecked
on this island.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.618
- We can't get off the island.
 - You can swim it.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.820
- Five hundred miles?
     - Try backstroke.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.623
Is very relaxing.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.959
No, you don't understand.
     Eccentric yes, but not mad.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.394
Long ago the art world
         decided Dubov was

03:16.463 --> 03:18.964
shall we say,
               a little far out.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.498
That's good way to say it.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.567
You know Dubov.
           Dubov don't know you.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.570
I am Thurston Howell III,
   world famous man of wealth

03:25.638 --> 03:27.105
and this lovely creature
beside me

03:27.174 --> 03:28.473
is Mrs. Thurston Howell III

03:28.542 --> 03:31.676
world famous patroness
     of the art.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.812
- Who are you, skinny kiddo?
  - I'm Gilligan.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.414
Then may be you can
      answer question.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.483
What is that called?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.984
Looks like
               hard boiled eggs.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.988
Peasant! It is
        scrambled eggs.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.596
Little girly.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.766
Little girly, little girly!

03:54.834 --> 03:56.501
My name is Mary Ann.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.471
- Very beautiful name, Marushka.
- Why don't you use it, please?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.974
- You mad on Dubov?
      - Well, who isn't?

04:03.043 --> 04:04.776
Everybody mad on Dubov?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.745
You've been pushing everybody
 around. What do you expect?

04:07.814 --> 04:10.181
They don't like it,
             why they don't go?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.617
Mr. Dubov, there is no way
off this island.

04:12.686 --> 04:16.555
- Dubov have way.
       - You do? How?

04:17.656 --> 04:20.558
Dubov don't talk
       on empty stomach.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.295
Seconds, thirds and fourths
   coming right up.

04:30.069 --> 04:33.104
- Now, Dubov is done.
- Never seen anyone eat so much.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.506
Was not even hungry.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.207
Tell us how to
get off this island.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.409
We looked all over the island.
  We couldn't find a boat.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.278
- Don't have boat.
   - Then you can't get off.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.612
- Can get off.
         - How?

04:41.681 --> 04:43.415
- By boat.
   - You don't have a boat.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.383
Have transmitter, call boat.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.386
You've got a transmitter?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.321
- Don't I just said that?
   - Yeah, where is it?

04:49.389 --> 04:51.589
- At cave.
      - Where's the cave?

04:51.658 --> 04:53.457
- If I tell, you come?
     - Of course.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.359
- You too?
           - Sure.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.994
Then I don't tell.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.263
Dubov, we've gotta be able
to use your transmitter.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.397
- To call boat?
        - Yes.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.665
- No.
             - No?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.701
Yes, no.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.704
Ten years ago,
   Dubov don't like critics.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.139
Dubov don't like people,
    Dubov don't like Dubov.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.674
So come to island.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.276
I think you're a real nice guy.
 Don't you Professor?

05:11.344 --> 05:14.478
He's one of the most charming,
likeable people I've ever met.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.747
Where's the transmitter?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.849
When Dubov is ready,
      Dubov call boat.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.186
I should think after 10 years
you'd be more than ready.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.520
You know when is right time?

05:22.589 --> 05:24.989
When Dubov look
      on painting and say

05:25.058 --> 05:26.724
"Dubov, you are ready."

05:26.793 --> 05:30.929
- Dubov, you are ready.
 - Dubov is ready...to take nap.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.539
Hello and goodbye.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.809
- Sure, don't be friendly.
- If you wanna be friends, fine.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.012
- Good.
 - Just don't order me around.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.215
- You sure got nice place here.
- Thanks.

05:50.284 --> 05:53.318
- Is now Dubov's.
      - Is now what?

05:53.387 --> 05:55.219
Going to take short nap
for 10-12 hours.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.588
Call me when it's time
for breakfast.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.557
- Listen, you, weasel, I--
   - Hey, Skipper.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.659
- Not now, Gilligan. I'm busy.
 - Please, Skipper.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.194
Gilligan, it'll have
          to wait whatever it is

06:03.262 --> 06:04.896
'cause I'm gonna throw this
     big ape out on his ear.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.632
- Be nice to him.
 - Better listen to him, fatso.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.067
- Fatso?
          - 'Skipper.'

06:09.136 --> 06:11.536
Would you mind stepping outside
for just a moment.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.404
Alright, Professor,
          but you better be here

06:13.473 --> 06:14.906
when I get back, Dubov.

06:14.975 --> 06:19.010
Don't worry. Dubov gonna be here
when you don't come back.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.080
- Oop!
 - Watch your head, roly-poly.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.950
- What is it, Professor?
    - Skipper, Skipper.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.552
We've got to be
               nice to him.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.287
Give me
        one good reason.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.089
He's got a transmitter.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.892
- Well, that's a good reason.
 - Yeah.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.462
Control yourself.
               Control yourself.

06:37.530 --> 06:41.533
I'm smiling.
       Look. I'm smiling.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.415
Are you sleeping?

06:57.484 --> 06:59.217
Of course, I'm sleeping,
        Mr. Howell.

06:59.285 --> 07:02.220
Who could stay awake
       on this nice hard ground?

07:02.289 --> 07:04.655
But he's sleeping.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.724
Hand me all your..
      shiver your timbers!

07:06.793 --> 07:09.461
Anytime you're through,
         Captain Bligh.

07:09.529 --> 07:10.795
I must have been dreaming.
   Is it morning?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.463
No, it's the middle
of the night

07:12.532 --> 07:13.832
but the sun
    is about to shine on us

07:13.901 --> 07:15.300
thanks to my sneaksmanship.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.935
I don't get it.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.838
I think Mr. Howell means that
   he's got an underhanded plot

07:19.906 --> 07:22.173
to get that transmitter
         away from Dubov.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.076
Yes, and the beauty of this plan
is its simplicity.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.912
The more simple the thing is,
the more beautiful it is.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.848
- I must be gorgeous.
 - Never mind him, Mr. Howell.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.251
First of all, we've got to get
 Dubov to paint a new painting.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.753
What good will that do?

07:35.822 --> 07:37.756
I must admit Mr. Howell,
      it's a very good question.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.857
- Thanks, shall I ask again?
 - No, you don't have to.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.359
Because I'll give
        you the answer.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.862
When he finishes the painting,
 we'll rave about it

07:43.930 --> 07:46.097
we'll fight over it,
   we'll bid millions for it.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.065
And he'll think that he is
   the greatest artist

07:48.134 --> 07:49.267
in the whole world.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.368
I get it, that way
         he'll wanna be rescued.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.672
And he'll be convinced that the
world is ready for Dubov again.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.973
Can he paint my picture?

07:56.042 --> 07:57.842
No, the world isn't
      quite that ready.

07:57.911 --> 08:02.179
Well, Mrs. Howell too, she says
Dubov never never paints people.

08:02.248 --> 08:06.751
- A-ha, but he'll paint Ginger.
- Yeah. No, she's people.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.855
He'll paint Ginger, believe me,
according to the Howell plan.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.390
You wanna go to sleep?
Just take that, that's it.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.125
- Nighty night.
        - Goodnight.

08:30.310 --> 08:34.145
- You sure Picasso paint you?
 - He pestered me for months.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.679
Chagall painted you?

08:35.748 --> 08:38.116
How could I say no
  to that darling little man?

08:38.184 --> 08:41.852
Okay, girly, you don't be
painted till Dubov paints you.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.689
Sorry, not interested.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.924
Do you hear what she said?
She's not interested.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.861
- That's what she said.
 - Why you don't be interested?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.829
Because, Mr. Dubov,
      I'm a movie star

08:51.898 --> 08:53.798
and I have to be careful
    about my image.

08:53.867 --> 08:58.436
Dubov will make you even more
famous than-than-than Mae Busch.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.406
- Who?
    - Mae Busch.<i> Krasavitsa.</i>

09:01.474 --> 09:03.073
There is a hot potato.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.310
Besides, I promised
      Salvador Dali

09:05.378 --> 09:06.611
that he could be next

09:06.680 --> 09:09.413
and everybody says
      that he's the most.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.851
You know what I say about
 Salvador Dali, I say phooey.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.085
Well, I'll be sure
       to tell him.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.055
Okay, girly,
if you don't pose for Dubov

09:17.123 --> 09:19.057
Dubov gets mad
and when Dubov gets mad

09:19.125 --> 09:22.593
he don't eat, he don't sleep
he sometimes even kills himself!

09:22.662 --> 09:24.562
I wouldn't want you
      to do that.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.597
Good. On your feet.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.500
Now, we must think of pose
for girly to paint.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.704
Well, the photographers say
     I look my best like this.

09:32.772 --> 09:36.274
No good.
No good.

09:36.343 --> 09:40.077
Let me think.
Idea's coming.

09:40.146 --> 09:44.549
Idea is coming.
                 Idea is coming.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.451
Idea is here.
Belly dancer.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.220
- Belly dancer?
        -<i> Da!</i>

09:49.289 --> 09:51.055
Well, I don't care if you're
    Leonardo da Vinci.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.324
I'm not posing
              as a belly dancer.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.892
What's wrong
with belly dancer?

09:54.961 --> 09:57.028
I happen to be an actress,
      not a stripper!

09:57.096 --> 10:00.198
Who said stripper?
Belly dancer.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.234
Ginger, he means Bali.
     Bali dancers.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.768
The island of Bali.

10:04.837 --> 10:09.273
Well, why didn't
                he say so?

10:09.342 --> 10:12.410
Like I say,
belly dancer.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.013
[singing in Russian]

10:18.351 --> 10:21.319
¶ We'll do it
       all over again ¶¶

10:22.289 --> 10:23.388
Don't peek.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.356
I merely wanted to know
how it was getting along?

10:25.424 --> 10:27.792
If you want to know how it's
    getting along, ask Dubov.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.894
- How is it getting along?
   - I don't tell you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.495
Oh, poo!

10:31.564 --> 10:34.099
[singing in Russian]

10:51.818 --> 10:53.518
- Hi, Gilligan.
    - Hi. What's this stuff?

10:53.587 --> 10:54.652
It's pretty good.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.188
Gilligan,
that's paint thinner.

10:59.726 --> 11:03.194
¶ Lada da da gee ra la ra rum ¶

11:03.262 --> 11:04.629
Hey!

11:04.698 --> 11:07.164
- Dubov takes nap.
       - Can I rest too?

11:07.233 --> 11:10.168
I don't care what you do.
Picture is finished.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.606
Help, help, somebody unbend me.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.575
(Mary Ann)
     I think he's through.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.410
[indistinct chatter]

11:19.478 --> 11:22.213
I've never seen
 anything like that in my life.

11:26.787 --> 11:31.089
I'll kill him. Just give me
 two minutes and I'll kill him.

11:31.157 --> 11:35.059
A week and a half
  I posed for tha-that thing.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.428
- Out of my way, Mr. Howell.
 - You got to remember our plan.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.463
I'll kill him first, and then
 I'll remember your plan.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.834
We've got to convince him that
  painting is absolutely great.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.803
That will take
an academy award performance.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.305
Listen, all of you,
remember to play the parts.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.943
I think it's absolutely divine,
perfectly fascinating.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.279
I've never seen anything like it
and that's the truth.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.713
What superb artistry!

11:55.782 --> 11:57.348
Why that painting
    must be worth a fortune.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.285
- I bid $100,000.
       - I bid $200,000.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.322
I wouldn't sell it for $300,000,
I'd burn it first.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.923
Let's hear it for the artist.
   Hip, hip.

12:05.992 --> 12:06.957
(all)
            Hurray!

12:07.026 --> 12:09.593
- Hip, hip.
          - Hurray!

12:09.662 --> 12:11.962
[all cheering]

12:12.031 --> 12:16.067
Dubov take bow,
     sign autographs later.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.469
Maybe I'll let ladies
     kiss hand of genius

12:18.537 --> 12:21.406
then send for boat
  and let world see painting.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.741
Mr. Howell, you were right.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.643
Your underhanded plan
     worked just great.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.312
You mind repeating that,
    skinny kiddo?

12:28.381 --> 12:31.282
Sure, Mr. Howell's underhanded
  plan worked just great.

12:31.351 --> 12:35.486
Oh-ho! A plan.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.288
Dubov have a plan too.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.123
Send you the bill.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.525
Dubov say pooh
         on you people.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.295
- Pooh on you people.
   - I know, I know, I know.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.098
- Pooh on you Gilligan.
    - Say that again.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.835
- Pooh on you--
        - Get out you!

13:09.221 --> 13:11.121
- Morning, Mr. Howell.
 - Ah, good morning, Gilligan.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.125
Look what I found in the jungle.
The picture Dubov did of Ginger.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.793
What a way
to start the day.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.730
Yeah. Hey, Mr. Howell, I'm sorry
I ruined your underhanded plan.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.230
Oh, that's alright,
Gilligan, my boy.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.133
You're a real nice guy,
       forgiving and forgetting.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.101
That's the motto of
the Howell Mortgage Company.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.470
If you can't forgive
or forget, foreclose.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.939
We made a lot of money.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.040
Mr. Howell, is this really
      supposed to be Ginger?

13:30.109 --> 13:33.010
Now what you see is, this is
the Ginger that we don't see.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.712
It's the turmoil,
the seething passion.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.380
Sort of thing like that.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.017
What he has painted here is what
we might say the inner woman.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.486
Oh, yeah. I kinda see
     her lungs and appendix now.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.222
I can see that you're not
a devotee of modern art.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.691
When I was in third grade

13:46.760 --> 13:49.060
I painted like that
     and they flunked me in art.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.294
It's hardly
the same thing.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.096
You see what Dubov
has painted here

13:52.165 --> 13:55.900
is a great color composition,
his great freedom of expression.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.301
He actually soared.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.571
What he has is the ability
to remain unencumbered.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.172
- What?
        - Unencumbered.

14:02.241 --> 14:06.077
- Don't you paint unencumbered?
- Sure, I can draw radishes too.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.012
Naughty, that's naughty..

14:08.080 --> 14:10.181
You say that you flunked art
in the third grade?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.950
- Twice.
 - Help me to lose no track.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.518
- It might work!
        - What?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.721
You stay here and I'll enlist
the aid of the others.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.390
Don't go away,
Gilligan, my boy.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.927
Girls, it is I,
      Thurston Howell III.

14:22.996 --> 14:26.431
- 'Come in.'
   - Come in. You heard that.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.873
I don't know.
     I-I guess it's possible.

14:41.347 --> 14:44.448
Keep calm, my boy.
Chicanery is afoot.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.984
- Who?
            - Ho-ho!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.728
What? Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind, Howell?

14:57.797 --> 14:59.964
Alright, alright.
               The Navy..

15:00.033 --> 15:02.332
Probably believes in flogging
 in the sails.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.370
That man is a hard sell,
a hard sell.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.172
I'll do whatever I can.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.108
Just show me a loophole,
Professor, show me a loophole.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.010
I do admit that setting
Gilligan up

15:13.079 --> 15:14.511
as a rival genius
would upset him

15:14.580 --> 15:16.147
and could probably lead him
in our direction.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.349
Did I hear you say Gilligan
 as a rival genius?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.218
That's right. Gilligan, you're
  gonna do an abstract painting.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.821
- I am?
 - And Dubov will scoff at it.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.423
He's pretty good at scoffing.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.125
We'll admire it and hail it
     as an artistic triumph.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.960
Mr. Howell, I think Dubov
   will think you're crazy.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.597
On the contrary, Gilligan, if he
follows his pattern and he will

15:33.666 --> 15:35.533
his next move will be to get
the art critics of the world

15:35.602 --> 15:37.368
to decide which of you
is the master painter?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.570
How're you gonna get the
art critics here on the island?

15:39.639 --> 15:43.174
Well, he can't. So he'll use his
transmitter to send a message.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.077
A boat will come, and presto,
   we are off the island.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.646
- You forgot one thing.
    - What's that?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.081
What if he doesn't get back?

15:50.149 --> 15:53.918
- He shall return.
  - He's a very stubborn man.

15:53.987 --> 15:54.919
He just might..

15:54.988 --> 15:56.888
[sniffing]
           He's so..

15:56.956 --> 15:59.490
[sniffing]

16:04.831 --> 16:06.330
Hmm, that sure
isn't paint thinner.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.133
It's turtle soup laced
     with clam sauce and shrimp.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.367
Smells great.
     Can I help you fan it?

16:10.436 --> 16:11.969
Oh, I'm not trying
       to cool it off.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.239
- It sure looks that way.
 - I'm just creating a breeze.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.273
Why?

16:16.342 --> 16:17.908
Because we don't
       have a telephone.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.245
- Because we don't have a what?
- Gilligan, stand back, please.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.047
I can't get
             my message through.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.916
I-I've heard sending messages
by drums and flags

16:24.984 --> 16:26.717
but never by waving soup.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.455
Ah-ha! My message has been
      received and answered.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.079
- Hi, little buddy.
      - Hi, Skipper.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.082
- And how's it going?
     - Okay, I guess.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.553
- You haven't even started yet.
- I know.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.754
Well, why not?

17:03.823 --> 17:06.223
I just can't seem
      to get in the mood.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.724
Oh, Gilligan, you don't have
  to get in the mood.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.193
Just put something on the canvas
and we'll do the rest.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.096
It's not that easy.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.531
How did your third grade teacher
get you in the mood?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.133
She used to sing to me.
    Do you know

17:16.202 --> 17:18.669
¶ Jack and Jill
      went up the hill ¶¶

17:18.738 --> 17:20.804
I know Jack and Jill,
  Gilligan, for goodness sake

17:20.873 --> 17:22.973
will you paint, so we can get
  that transmitter?

17:23.041 --> 17:25.777
- What should I put on there?
- Well, a leaf, a tree, a bush.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.511
Anything. What difference
   does it make?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.815
Maybe makes no difference to you
sailors, but to us artists..

17:30.883 --> 17:32.582
Gilligan!

17:32.651 --> 17:37.020
- I know, I'll paint you.
 - Me? Of all the crazy ideas.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.456
It's very hard
      to get in the mood.

17:39.525 --> 17:43.760
- Okay, I'll pose. You win.
  - Pose like Ginger.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.029
That's silly.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.030
Very, very hard
             to get in the mood.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.400
Pose like Ginger.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.039
Well, you know
what I feel like?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.240
Do you know
             what you look like?

17:56.309 --> 17:57.875
Gilligan, never mind,
just paint.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.344
No. You're not the dancer type.
 You're more like a sailor.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.147
Do the sailor pose, Skipper,
    like this.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.116
Yeah, now lift
                 the other foot.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.385
If I lift the other foot,
I'll fall on the ground.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.486
You never know, Skipper. Why
don't you just try? Just lift--

18:09.555 --> 18:11.488
Gilligan, would you get behind
that easel and paint?

18:11.557 --> 18:15.860
- I'll paint you from memory.
 - Yes, from memory.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.574
Yes, Gilligan. It's me
and it's very funny.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.143
Here, Skipper,
             let me take it off.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.413
Gilligan, will you stop that?

18:38.417 --> 18:40.885
Here, Skipper, I'll be
          done in a minute.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.857
It's all done.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.892
- That's me?
          - Yeah.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.328
- Are you sure?
        - Uh-huh.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.698
Nincompooper,
               it's upside down.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.176
Oh, you old scoundrel,
I know what you're up to

19:05.244 --> 19:06.744
but you're not gonna
get away with it.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.047
Get away with what,
   Mr. Man of Wealth? Phooey!

19:10.116 --> 19:11.348
Selling your
     second-grade paintings

19:11.417 --> 19:13.618
and holding out
      on your masterpiece.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.753
- Dubov do that?
 - That's exactly what you did.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.556
Alright, alright. Tell me,
how much is it worth?

19:18.624 --> 19:22.726
Somebody fall in a bucket of
paint and wipe face with canvas.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.562
Very funny,
     just name your price.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.764
You really wanna know
     what this worth?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.000
Phooey.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.668
Thurston, where ever did you
find that divine painting?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.237
Well, never mind
       where I found it.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.772
This old scoundrel refuses
     to part with it.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.341
Oh, but he must, our entire
collection of Dubovs

19:37.410 --> 19:38.676
would be worthless
without it.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.177
- Hi, Mr. Howell.
       - Quiet, Gilligan.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.380
Can't you see I'm busy
        dickering with a genius?

19:42.448 --> 19:43.580
Then, I guess you're done
    looking at my picture.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.417
Yes, I guess..
                  Wait a minute.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.985
Did you hear that,
       Lovey?

19:48.054 --> 19:51.555
You mean, our Gilligan painted
that masterpiece? Unbelievable.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.323
He must have..
       Gilligan, hold it.

19:53.392 --> 19:56.193
- I bid $100,000.
       - I bid 200,000.

19:56.262 --> 19:59.629
Hey, fatso,
        Dubov wanna talk on you.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.466
Oh, I didn't see you
sitting there, Dubov.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.668
You saw a painting
        of skinny kiddo?

20:04.737 --> 20:08.172
- See it? I posed for it.
 - You posed for that picture?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.940
Certainly, that was the real me.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.942
The man of the seas,
     sailing into the wind

20:12.011 --> 20:14.411
with my bare hands
      fighting the ocean.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.281
Dubov wanna tell you something.
I saw the picture.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.350
You lost fight.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.180
Okay, it's ready.
      Everybody come out.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.849
Everybody come out!

20:52.918 --> 20:55.552
Would you mind holding it down,
I'm trying to get some shuteye.

20:55.621 --> 20:58.055
- It's no time for nap, come.
 - Yes, well, well.

20:58.123 --> 21:00.123
Alright, alright, alright.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.993
Take a look.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.597
- Dubov, you've done it again.
 - Naturally.

21:07.666 --> 21:11.035
- Painted exactly what I wanted.
- Alright, how you going to pay?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.603
By cash or by check?

21:12.672 --> 21:15.673
How much do you want
            for this one?

21:15.742 --> 21:16.873
For sign?

21:16.942 --> 21:18.943
Well, you see, I've got
         to unload my Dubovs.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.912
With Gilligan on the island,
  they are absolutely worthless.

21:21.981 --> 21:25.916
Take paintings, take sign,
Dubov takes..

21:25.985 --> 21:27.584
Gillian, I don't look on you.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.154
- Hi, Mr. Howell. Hi, Mr. Dubov.
- Hello, maestro.

21:30.223 --> 21:34.257
Mr. Dubov, Gilligan's
      going to paint my picture.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.694
Dubov don't look
on you too, little girly.

21:36.762 --> 21:39.363
Remember, Gilligan,
I'm posing for you tomorrow.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.099
- I remember.
- Phooey on you too, rich lady.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.801
You know, Mr. Dubov, some of
these paintings are pretty good.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.437
Pretty good?

21:46.506 --> 21:48.872
It's good thing I don't talk
    on you 'cause I talk to you.

21:48.941 --> 21:52.576
If I don't talk to you,
 I gonna bang you on your head.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.077
We shouldn't
            let him go away mad.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.080
Well, don't worry. He'll return
and with the transmitter.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.782
I'll go tell Professor
          and Ginger it worked.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.150
I'll go with you.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.919
Mr. Howell, how much will
     you give for this one here?

22:01.988 --> 22:05.255
- Oh, well, what is it?
    - Self-portrait.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.356
- You know something?
    - What?

22:06.425 --> 22:09.060
Looks more like Dubov. Phooey.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.879
Sshh.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.449
Outside.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.124
What's the matter?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.359
If you give Dubov
painting lessons

22:42.428 --> 22:43.794
Dubov give you transmitter.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.964
- Say it again.
  - Kid, your ears got accent?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.832
- When will you bring it?
   - In morning.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.101
Okay. You bring the transmitter,
I'll give you painting lesson.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.104
- Master, you are too kind.
  - That's me, Gilligan.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.472
Boy, good guy.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.741
- Dubov is your slave.
     - Yeah.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.944
- Dubov is your slave.
      - Yeah.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.385
That transmitter is the most
 beautiful sight in the world.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.922
Alright, Skipper,
       send the message.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.492
Mayday, mayday. This is the
  Skipper of the SS Minnow.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.762
This is the Skipper of
    the SS Minnow. I repeat.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.864
Can you hear me? This is
 the Skipper of the SS Minnow.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.432
- Skipper.
       - Quiet, Professor.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.868
I'm trying to transmit.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.937
Skipper, we're the only ones
  tuned in, you see.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.206
I must have pulled that out
when I started transmitting.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.409
I'll fix that in a jiffy.

23:34.680 --> 23:39.417
Oh, no. It's-it's rusted,
it's corroded clear through.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.619
Dubov must have had this
on the island for years.

23:41.687 --> 23:45.022
There's a note in here.
         It's from Dubov.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.192
[imitating Dobov]
           "Dear people,
           on who I make phooey.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.295
"Island don't be big enough
     for two geniuses.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.463
"So I builded raft
      from paintings

23:53.532 --> 23:55.432
"and flow to other island.

23:55.501 --> 23:59.570
When Dubov ready,
       Dubov come back."

23:59.639 --> 24:01.271
Well, at least, he left us
      the transmitter.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.575
- Yeah, but look at it.
 - Oh, no, no. It's gotta work.

24:04.643 --> 24:08.345
It's gotta work.
        Mayday, mayday!

24:08.414 --> 24:11.749
June-day, July-day..

24:18.157 --> 24:19.756
Look at that, Howell.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.159
I wanna tell you it does prove
that talent shows up

24:22.228 --> 24:23.460
in the most unlikely places.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.495
Talent is an inner fire of flame

24:25.564 --> 24:26.831
that can burst
               in any direction.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.999
Exactly. Look at the way
he's holding that brush.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.034
Bold attack,
                 daring strokes.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.870
And to think it's
my little buddy doing it.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.739
That talk doesn't bother you,
   does it, Gilligan?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.508
- 'No, Mr. Howell.'
      - Alright.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.042
Don't stop.
Just keep going.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.177
Keep at it, my boy.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.913
- Okay, but I have one question.
- What is it?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.882
How many times
     I've to paint the hut?

24:44.950 --> 24:48.152
Keep going, Gilligan,
until we tell you to stop.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.768
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:04.837 --> 25:06.269
¶ They're here for
      a long, long time ¶

25:06.338 --> 25:08.605
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:08.674 --> 25:10.640
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.709 --> 25:12.676
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:12.745 --> 25:14.812
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:14.880 --> 25:16.947
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:17.016 --> 25:19.082
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:19.151 --> 25:21.484
¶ No phone, no lights,
    no motorcars ¶

25:21.553 --> 25:23.586
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:23.655 --> 25:25.789
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:25.858 --> 25:27.925
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:27.993 --> 25:30.160
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:30.229 --> 25:32.128
¶ You're sure to get
      a smile ¶

25:32.197 --> 25:34.798
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:34.866 --> 25:37.167
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶
