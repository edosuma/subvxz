00:01.001 --> 00:03.795
<i>-Previously on </i>The Resident...
-Just so we're clear,

00:03.878 --> 00:05.672
you're my one-hour person.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.507
If I had one hour left to live,

00:07.590 --> 00:09.634
I would want to spend it with you.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.553
I will take it.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.680
(both chuckle)

00:13.763 --> 00:15.557
It's stupid to question
the love of your life

00:15.640 --> 00:18.351
for something that's just... stupid.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.894
So Jessica

00:19.978 --> 00:21.855
<i>is the love of your life?</i>

00:21.938 --> 00:23.440
<i>She has Moyamoya.</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:25.191
She could die of strokes
before she turns 30.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.609
Unless I perform a cerebral bypass.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.862
Your intracranial pressures
and post-op labs

00:28.945 --> 00:30.196
are trending in the right direction.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.698
Thank you.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.616
Dr. Pravesh, have you ever
saved a princess before?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.993
It was a team effort.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.036
The king will want to thank you.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.954
I expect he will be calling shortly.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.082
-Well, what do I call him?
-Your Majesty.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.429
(Devon laughs)

00:54.512 --> 00:57.057
Well, you are a pleasant surprise.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.976
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.979
Ah, today's been full of surprises.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.689
My father's coming into town.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.400
Your father? The king?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.569
He's throwing me a last-minute gala

01:09.652 --> 01:11.738
for my 25th birthday next week,

01:11.821 --> 01:13.865
and he wants me
to invite the team of doctors

01:13.948 --> 01:15.450
-who saved my life.
-A gala. Wow.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.868
That sounds fancy.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.328
It's too fancy.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.455
Black-tie.
I know it's a lot to ask.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.790
No, I'm in.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.918
Especially if I get to see you in...

01:25.001 --> 01:26.377
princess mode.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.754
(laughs):
That's great.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.381
Uh, here's the thing.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.802
My father would have to meet you
when he arrives.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.887
-It would be a whole thing.
-Say no more.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.724
Just tell the king that
I'm looking forward to it, okay?

01:39.808 --> 01:42.560

-Get out of here. We're late.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.485

02:32.569 --> 02:34.237
I'm supposed to meet somebody here.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.447
Irving. (laughs)

02:36.531 --> 02:38.491
What's going on?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.369
Nice coattail, by the way.
(chuckles)

02:41.452 --> 02:43.079
(voice breaks):
"Let me not..."

02:43.163 --> 02:45.081
(Irving clears throat)

"Let me not

Shakespeare? Babe, that's...
that's so romantic. (chuckles)

03:03.183 --> 03:04.350
More romantic if you let me finish.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.021
-Oh, right.
-(clears throat) Uh, it...

03:09.189 --> 03:11.399
You know what?
Never mind.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.902
(laughs):
I'll just show you.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.323

03:27.415 --> 03:29.751

-You didn't let me finish!

03:29.834 --> 03:31.502
I don't care.
Yes, yes, yes!

03:31.586 --> 03:34.005
-Yes? Come here.
-(cheering, applause)

03:34.088 --> 03:35.215
-Yes?
-Yes!

03:39.510 --> 03:42.305
We're getting hitched, baby!

IRVING:
Tonight's the night.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.380
-Pravesh's royal debut.
-(laughs)

04:15.463 --> 04:18.132
Is that notes of sandalwood I smell?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.176
-It's just a birthday party.
-Mm.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.681
One where I'm going to meet
my princess girlfriend's father,

04:24.764 --> 04:27.141
the king, for the first time.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.519
Wow, you're right.
Sounds just like any other birthday party.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.020
Can't be too good a party

04:31.104 --> 04:32.939
considering I didn't get an invite.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.607
You weren't on Nadine's medical team, man.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526
Besides, you're not exactly
the life of the party.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.195
Hey, I'll have you know
I was an animal in my day.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.989
A-A wild man.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.408
I once woke up vomiting in St. Louis.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.577
-So?
-I began the evening in Kenosha.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.788
Uh, which reminds me,
Garrison called out sick,

04:48.871 --> 04:50.331
and you need to take her shift.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.667
Uh, cool story, Nolan, but no.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.962
I did an overnight just so
I could have the day to prep.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.422
Too bad you're needed here.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.010
Looks like Cinderella
might not make it after all.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.729
-(phone ringing)
-(R&B music playing)

05:12.812 --> 05:14.147
(phone beeps)

05:14.230 --> 05:16.399
Did you know you can lighten armpit skin

05:16.482 --> 05:17.859
with raw ground potatoes?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.986
(chuckles) I did, actually.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.571
Don't ask me how.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.072
(chuckles) You're on your way?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.574
<i>You're gonna meet me at the salon, right?</i>

05:24.657 --> 05:26.075
Yeah, that's the thing.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.952
You haven't told your dad yet about us,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.287
<i>-have you?</i>
-You're not coming?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.456
If you haven't told him...

05:31.539 --> 05:32.790
It's too late. I already did.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.292
(sighs)

05:34.375 --> 05:35.835
Okay, don't worry.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.378
I'll figure something out.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.172
<i>Just don't replace me yet.</i>

05:39.255 --> 05:42.884
Well, I do have the prince
of Zamunda on standby.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.469
I've seen <i>Coming to America.</i>

05:44.552 --> 05:46.012
Zamunda is not a real place.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.805
(chuckles softly)

05:47.889 --> 05:49.682
I will see you soon.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.060
<i>♪ In a heartbeat, we got... ♪</i>

05:55.438 --> 05:58.524
Do you remember what happened
when you fainted, Mary?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.234
I was in gym class.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.236
I've been fighting with the school

06:02.320 --> 06:03.696
about these PE requirements.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
Mary's punished academically
for not having

06:05.823 --> 06:07.158
the energy to run laps.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.826
Do you get tired often?

06:08.910 --> 06:10.745
-(door opens)
-I guess.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.122
Here we go again.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.626
Try flying 30 hours
from Beijing to Atlanta. That's tiring.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.252
Hey, darling.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.463
Sweetie, I told you
I would take care of this.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.465
I love my husband,
but he indulges her every

06:22.548 --> 06:24.717
-ache and pain.
-Mom, I fainted.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.637
I know, sweetie,
and I'm sorry that happened.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.305
But you have to stop making yourself sick

06:29.389 --> 06:30.807
to get out of your responsibilities.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.017
Maybe she's sick
because you push her too hard.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.769
Well, you don't push her enough.
She's 17.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.521
She needs to be getting ready for college,

06:36.604 --> 06:38.106
but you're keeping her tethered to you.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.982
Okay, why don't we do a full workup.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.359
That'll give us some answers,

06:41.442 --> 06:43.027
and we can move forward from there.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.780
Thank you.
Finally, we can put this to rest

06:45.863 --> 06:48.741
-once and for all.
-Okay. I'll be right back.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.831
Any luck finding a replacement?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.833
Butler's out of town.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.001
Ward is on maternity leave.
I got nothing.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.713
Nadine will forgive me, eventually.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.882
I'll take your shift.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.509
Really?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.553
Yeah, you came through for me
during my proposal.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.763
Plus, if I go home now,
Jess'll make me decide

07:10.847 --> 07:12.473
between teal and aqua napkins.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.558
Spoiler alert.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.767
(whispers):
They're exactly the same.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.853
Just figure out
what she likes and tell her

07:16.936 --> 07:18.646
it's your favorite, too.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.149
See? Solutions like that
are why I'm going to cover for you.

07:21.232 --> 07:25.486
All right, give me another hour
and then go to your ball.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.745
Can I help you with something?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.542
Shut the door, if you don't mind.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.381
Red Rock is dismantling

07:45.465 --> 07:48.009
the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology

07:48.092 --> 07:50.303
effective six weeks from now.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.056
You're letting them all go?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.433
You think it's wise

07:55.516 --> 07:57.768
to just get rid of an entire department?

07:57.852 --> 08:00.480
It's already been decided.
It's a black hole.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.398
Jettisoning it will help
with our bottom line.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.192
Respectfully, our bottom line isn't

08:04.275 --> 08:06.152
the only consideration here.
What about expectant mothers?

08:06.235 --> 08:08.696
Those patients will be
taken care of at Atlanta General

08:08.779 --> 08:10.281
where they have a fully-functioning OB.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.033
We have a fully-functioning OB here.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.494
Not for long.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.580
Hundreds of crucial staff
will lose their jobs.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.541
As for the staff, I need you
to give notice to the residents.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.507
Wow.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.552
The chair and chief resident of OB

08:31.636 --> 08:33.554
are at a conference,
so you don't have a choice.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.972
Neither do those residents.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.974
If you let them go,
they won't get accepted

08:37.058 --> 08:38.392
into another residency, not this year,

08:38.476 --> 08:39.769
not when they're in the middle

08:39.852 --> 08:41.312
of their training here at Chastain.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.980
And you still
want to set them back like this?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.107
This is a business.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.235
You wanted this chief resident title.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.196
It's time to earn it.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.074
Give the obstetrics residents notice.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.870
(door opens, closes)

09:04.669 --> 09:07.129
-Gemma, I'm Dr. Pravesh. I'm here...
-Shh.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.798
GEMMA:
Trust me. This is why I chose

09:08.881 --> 09:10.299
to dress <i>you </i>for the Met this year.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.593
You are my only priority.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.096
The dress will be perfect, I promise.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
Ms. Lin, I'm here to examine you.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.558
Mind taking that call later?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.270
Jen, we'll continue
this conversation later.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.605
(chuckles)
Talk soon.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.649
Three years, I've been the boss.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.068
Sometimes I forget
I don't call the shots everywhere.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.446
Your chart says that
you're having abdominal pain.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.490
Plus some vomiting and weight loss.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.409
But I like that part.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.703
(chuckles softly)

09:38.786 --> 09:40.705
Is something wrong?

09:40.788 --> 09:42.331
Does it hurt when I press down here?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.543
A little uncomfortable,
but, no, it doesn't hurt.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.003
I'd like to get a CT

09:47.086 --> 09:48.879
before I let you get back to work, okay?

09:48.963 --> 09:50.298
No, thanks.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.758
Fashion isn't for the young or the weak.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.719
Uh, since the deck is stacked
against me at the moment,

09:54.802 --> 09:57.179
I have to get back.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.641
Look, Gemma,
you want to be somewhere else.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.518
Somewhere more important to you.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.395
Believe me, I get it.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.648
But you're here because
you're not feeling your best.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.110
So let me get some images,
and we'll go from there.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.320
Deal?

10:12.403 --> 10:14.488
You're a little bossy.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.824
I like you, so I will stay.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.660
But if you make me wear one
of those hideous hospital gowns,

10:19.744 --> 10:21.078
we're gonna have a problem.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.290
I'll be right back.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.503
Oh, my God.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.048
(laughs)
You kept our participation trophy.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.258
Oh, yeah, to punish myself.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.135
Never in the history of medicine

10:36.218 --> 10:38.304
has peds won the Resident Olympics.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.513
Until that year.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.973
(laughs):
I remember you were so mad,

10:41.057 --> 10:42.642
you punched a hole
in the locker room wall.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.394
-Hey, they never proved it was me.
-(chuckles)

10:45.478 --> 10:47.063
And we both know that game was rigged.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.732
That night, you told me
I should switch into OB.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.401
Now I can't imagine doing anything else.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.404
So, what'd you need to talk about?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.990
Gabbi...

10:58.074 --> 11:00.660
I hate that I'm the one telling you this.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.248
Red Rock is shutting down
the OB department.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.211
I wanted to let you know
as soon as possible.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.673
In six weeks, you won't
have a residency here anymore.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.217
Chastain is my home.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.928
This is the only place I've...
I've ever worked.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.638
(sighs heavily)

11:20.721 --> 11:23.224
I have left word at every single hospital
across the state

11:23.307 --> 11:24.975
to try and get you transferred.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.605
I can't make any promises,
but I'll pull every favor I can.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.899
But I'll have to start over.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.526
Be an intern again.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.362
I-I'm a year away from a real salary.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.531
I have student loans
that have been in deferment.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.908
This is my career.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.868
I know, and I've spoken
to every department head

11:42.952 --> 11:44.203
to try and keep you here.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.871
There just isn't room.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.957
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.919
I took a year's lease on my apartment.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.879
I'm gonna have to move home
with my parents.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.257
I'm-I'm sorry.
I need-I need to go.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.096
-(elevator bell dings)
-And just like that,

12:02.179 --> 12:03.681
good doctors sacrificed
for the bottom line.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.725
These residents
are still in their training.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.101
It's almost impossible for them

12:07.184 --> 12:08.561
to get reassigned into a new program.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.229
Even if they do find a new hospital,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.732
they might have to start over
from their intern year.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.444
(sighs)
I came up with some of these OB interns

12:16.527 --> 12:18.571
from med school.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.741
These are good doctors, good people.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.492
I can't let them go until I know

12:23.576 --> 12:25.494
I've done everything I can to stop this.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.121
Mary Lawson's test results are back.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.831
Thank you.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.083
Huh.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.085
Not the news you were hoping for?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.296
I'm not convinced
any news would be sufficient

12:35.379 --> 12:36.714
for this family.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.507
-You need backup?
-Not yet.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.926
But if they start
trying to kill each other.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.387
(laughs):
I'll stand by.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.265
(door opens)

12:46.348 --> 12:49.143
Well, I just reviewed Mary's test results,

12:49.226 --> 12:51.395
and I'm happy to report
that everything looks normal.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.230
So there's nothing wrong with me?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.858
Well, your symptoms are real,
but the tests show

12:55.941 --> 12:58.152
that nothing is emergent,
so that's good news.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.528
SUSAN:
See?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.113
I told you.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.741
Here. Drink this.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.284
It helps with your stress.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.953
She said Mary's symptoms are real.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.498
You don't look good, kiddo.
Are you okay?

13:10.581 --> 13:12.541
Actually, I'm not
feeling that... that good.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.709
I... (inhales)

13:13.793 --> 13:15.294
I'm having trouble breathing,

13:15.377 --> 13:17.338
-but I guess it's nothing.
-Let's listen.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.633
Take a deep breath.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.092
(breathing deeply)

13:22.176 --> 13:24.303
And another.
Feeling any pain?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.305
My chest hurts.
I-I feel hot.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.432
-She's having a panic attack!
-That you gave her.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.600
-(beep)
-NIC: Your sats have dropped.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.101
I'm gonna put you on oxygen

13:31.185 --> 13:33.896
-and admit you for observation.
-You're going to admit her?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.439
You just said she was fine.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.233
I told you something was wrong.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.401
Okay, I'm gonna need you guys
to leave the room, please.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.738
(labored breathing)

13:42.822 --> 13:44.240
-(whispers): Thank you.
-(Nic whispers)

13:47.034 --> 13:48.494
NIC:
All right.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.579
(quiet electrical humming)

13:58.504 --> 14:00.589
Introduce me to her.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.800
What?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.219
Gemma Lin is single-handedly responsible

14:05.302 --> 14:07.263
for bringing avant-garde to streetwear.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.099
There is no one
who can hold a candle to her.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.852
She's an icon.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.729
But I wouldn't expect you
to know anything about that.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.524
What? 'Cause I'm a guy
I don't know about fashion?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.110
You tell me.
What are you wearing tonight?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.612
It's a royal ball.
I have a tux.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.031
You have a tux, or you rented a tux?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.160
I figured.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.746
Introduce me or don't.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.456
-I will find a way.
-(beeping)

14:37.710 --> 14:39.628
Well, that explains the abdominal pain.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.089
A mass in her stomach extending
into her small intestine.

14:42.172 --> 14:45.050
Doesn't have the appearance
of a typical stomach cancer.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.137
Regardless, she's gonna need
an endoscopy to biopsy the mass.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.682
(sighs)
Hopefully, I'll have some answers

14:51.765 --> 14:54.101
for her before I leave.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.936
Don't you mean "we"?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.563
That's surgical.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.690
Gemma's <i>our </i>patient now.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.109
I told you I'd find a way.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.195
(door opens)

15:05.279 --> 15:06.322
(sighs)

15:06.405 --> 15:07.990
How are you feeling?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.700
Better.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.746
I know I seem like the girl
who cried wolf, but, uh...

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
something feels... wrong.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.416
I believe you.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.209
And we're gonna figure out what it is.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.212
That's why my dad doesn't want me in PE.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.881
He says I'm not like the other kids.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.466
But I want to be.
I just...

15:27.051 --> 15:28.636
He means well,

15:28.719 --> 15:32.431
but ever since Mom died,
he's been a little...

15:32.514 --> 15:33.849
overprotective.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.935
-Susan's your stepmom?
-She just wants me

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
to be independent, mm?

15:37.853 --> 15:40.356
Move out and...
and stand on my own two feet,

15:40.439 --> 15:41.899
and I want that, too.

15:41.982 --> 15:45.194
Could all this just be my anxiety?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.363
Ah, you'd be surprised

15:47.446 --> 15:50.282
the toll that stress can take on the body.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.285
Are you feeling anxious right now?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.745
No. I just...

15:54.828 --> 15:57.081
My legs feel, like...

15:57.164 --> 15:59.583
tingly, like Jell-O.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.379
NIC:
How about this? Do you feel this?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.881
I don't feel that at all.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967
What does that mean?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.432
Dr. Bell.
I need to get new assignments

16:15.516 --> 16:17.267
for some obstetrics residents.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.354
You have room for, say,
two in gen surgery?

16:22.439 --> 16:24.942
Depends.
Why are they leaving OB?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.820
Red Rock is shutting down
the entire department.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.699
You know, I should've seen this coming.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.909
OB has the highest premiums
and malpractice claims

16:33.993 --> 16:36.203
-of any department.
-Yeah, and new moms can stay

16:36.286 --> 16:38.205
for days without Red Rock billing a dime.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.833
It's their nightmare.
Maximum care, minimum profit.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.459
No, I think this new neurosurgery center

16:42.543 --> 16:44.837
has them overextended,
and this is just the beginning.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.172
-Well, how about we stop it?
-Well, we-we can't.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.174
No one can. The only thing
that talks in medicine is money.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.759
So unless you got a whole lot of it

16:50.843 --> 16:52.344
-lying around...
-I know, I know.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.722
Well, maybe we can't stop it,
but what we can do

16:54.805 --> 16:56.849
is try and help at least
some of these doctors,

16:56.932 --> 16:59.226
who will lose their careers if we don't.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.562
Two residents?

17:01.645 --> 17:03.772
-That's all I'm asking.
-Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.443
Your doctor is going to a black-tie event,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.319
and I think he needs your help.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.072
He's clueless.
You're brilliant.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.575
No, seriously, your fall line
was my favorite collection

17:14.658 --> 17:16.243
-of the year.
-(chuckles)

17:16.326 --> 17:18.287
-I am such a big fan.
-Thank you.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.913
Hey.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.290
MINA:
Ooh.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.624
No. No, no, no, no, no.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.585
What are you wearing?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.045
What do you mean?
It's a tux.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.546
Says who?

17:27.629 --> 17:29.965
Okay, I'm leaving,
but I will be back to check on you

17:30.049 --> 17:32.176
after your endoscopy.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.928
But right now,
I have a princess waiting for me.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.473
-Is she blind?
-Uh, seriously, though,

17:37.556 --> 17:38.766
you can't go looking like that.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.935
I appreciate all your concern,

17:42.019 --> 17:44.271
-but I really don't have the time to...
-I do.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.690
And I can't, in good conscience,
send you to a party like this.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.777
My team can get you into
something amazing immediately.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.576
Okay. Fine.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.412
What's your chest measurement? 38?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.706
(laughs)
42, at least.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.792
You're a 38.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.007
Whoa.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.675
Who invited 007?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.969
Well, you better bring
your A game tonight, Hawkins,

18:16.053 --> 18:17.387
'cause I ain't messing around here.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.889
-(chuckles) I can see that.
-(laughs)

18:18.972 --> 18:20.057
How did this happen?

18:20.140 --> 18:23.602
My patient is a famous fashion designer,

18:23.685 --> 18:25.604
and, as it turns out,
part fairy godmother.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.023
And you mix that with Mina's
very aggressive comments

18:28.107 --> 18:30.734
about my rental tux, and voilà.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.735
(chuckles):
Yeah.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.362
Well, you look good, man.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.447
(phone vibrating)

18:39.743 --> 18:42.579
-(alarm beeping)
-(gasping)

18:42.663 --> 18:45.207
-What happened?
-Well, she just got back from an X-ray.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.334
-I came to take her for the endoscopy.
-Oh, make it stop.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.710
All right, let's get four of morphine.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.045
Does it hurt more when I push my hand in

18:50.129 --> 18:52.005
-or when I take it away?
-(groans) When you take it away.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.340
Rebound tenderness.
Guarding.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.551
Surgical abdomen.
I'll check the X-rays.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.136
(gasping)

18:59.179 --> 19:00.556
-Air under the diaphragm.
-She's perforated.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.849
Wh-What does that mean?

19:01.932 --> 19:03.767
It means we're skipping the endoscopy.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.769
-You need surgery now. Get Nolan.
-No. No, no, no, no.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.354
-I can't-I can't go alone.
-Shh. Shh.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.398
-(crying): I have no one.
-Shh.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.151
-I'm gonna die alone.
-You're not gonna die, Gemma.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
-I will not let that happen.
-Dr. Pravesh,

19:14.278 --> 19:15.529
please stay with me.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.698
(sobbing):
I'm so scared.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.283
I'm not gonna leave you.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.701
I promise.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.536
All right? I'm right here.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.288
-(alarm beeping)
-(gasping)

19:24.371 --> 19:26.665
I got your page.
What do you need?

19:26.748 --> 19:28.542
Her O2 sats are in the 80s.
We need to intubate.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.211
-I can't breathe.
-Hey. I need meds and an airway kit.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.130
Please just help her.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.465
Her paralysis is progressing rapidly.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.259
She's not gonna be able
to keep breathing on her own.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.969
-What's causing the paralysis?
-We don't know.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.847
CONRAD:
Got it.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.015
All right, it's gonna be okay, Mary.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.017
This is gonna put you to sleep, all right?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.019
CONRAD:
All good.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.315
-Okay, here we go.
-Ready?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.192
Yep.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.194
-Oh, my God.
-You never believed her.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.945
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.700
-NIC: Got it?
-CONRAD: Got it.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.122
All right, the tube's in.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.124
-She's stable, for now.
-SUSAN: For now?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.792
You-you mean she could get worse?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.170
Not if we can help it.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.759
MINA: I'll begin with an incision
in the gastric fundus.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.886
10-blade.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.388
NOLAN:
Got any tips on crashing a royal ball?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.432
Don't.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.976
(phone vibrating)

20:29.061 --> 20:31.146
(sighs):
Hey. I know. I'm late.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.481
I'm sorry, Nadine.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.691
-My patient needed me.
<i>-I understand.</i>

20:34.775 --> 20:36.026
<i>It's just...</i>

20:36.109 --> 20:38.487
<i>people are starting to arrive.</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:40.113
<i>Traditionally, you'd be by my side.</i>

20:40.197 --> 20:42.407
I will be there as soon as I can.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.993
Look, I promise you,
this is a straightforward procedure.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.997
-I'll be out of here in no time.
-NOLAN: What the hell?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.501
Is that...?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.670
A giant, stomach-shaped hairball.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.921
Nadine, I have to go.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.925
You good?

21:00.008 --> 21:02.219
I think I got hair in my mouth.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.137
I've heard about this before,

21:04.221 --> 21:06.473
but I've never seen such
a severe case of trichophagia.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.016
Gemma's eating her own hair?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.935
NOLAN:
That would explain the no eyebrows.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.937
An obstruction this big, she's been eating

21:12.020 --> 21:13.563
more than just her eyebrows.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.774
NOLAN:
And that's not all of it.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.193
There must be a-a tail.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.780
Extends from the gastric body,
beyond the pylorus,

21:21.863 --> 21:23.699
into the duodenum.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.201
-It's Rapunzel syndrome.
-Yeah, it appears so.

21:26.285 --> 21:30.163
We have to untangle the hair
that has wound itself

21:30.247 --> 21:31.623
through the intestines to extract it.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.668
Yes, repairing whatever damage
we need to along the way.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.421
(sighs)
Sounds complex.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.382
You should call your princess
and let her know.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.800
This is gonna take a while.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.180
(sighing)

21:47.264 --> 21:50.225
Sinus bradycardia with increasing pauses,

21:50.309 --> 21:51.226
up to five seconds.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.561
Labs are pristine.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.229
The spinal tap came back negative.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.981
Nothing on imaging.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.191
But her paralysis is moving so fast.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.985
She could go into sinus arrest.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.362
Let's put the pads on her, just in case.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.574
Let's keep the crash cart bedside,
ready to go.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.576
This doesn't make any sense.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.203
When she came here,
her symptoms were so vague.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.623
Respiratory failure and...

22:13.707 --> 22:15.250
and now her heart.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.003
-We're missing something.
-Mm-hmm.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.921
(monitor beeps)

22:20.005 --> 22:21.715
It's just the pulse ox.
It's been finicky.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.133
Nail polish can sometimes
prevent the pulse ox

22:23.216 --> 22:25.844
from giving an accurate reading.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.929
Wait.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.349
Mees' lines.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.354
Sometimes found in chemotherapy patients

22:35.437 --> 22:37.773
or ones in renal failure.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.567
Or when exposed to heavy metals.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.028
Mary's blood levels are back.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.030
The heavy metal in her blood is thallium.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.449
-What?
-Good news is,

22:47.532 --> 22:49.117
with some Prussian blue and dialysis,

22:49.201 --> 22:50.744
-we can treat her.
-The bad news is

22:50.827 --> 22:53.246
thallium is not
a naturally occurring element.

22:53.330 --> 22:56.083
Someone could be giving it
to her intentionally.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.085
Someone's poisoning Mary?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.169
Uh, who?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.712
(sighs)

23:00.796 --> 23:03.382
Someone with access and...

23:03.465 --> 23:04.716
(sighs)

23:04.800 --> 23:06.218
...proximity.

23:06.301 --> 23:09.304
Susan married a man
who's way more invested

23:09.388 --> 23:12.307
in his daughter than he is her.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.851
So maybe she couldn't take it?

23:14.935 --> 23:16.978
She does want her out of the house.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.815
Thallium is illegal in the United States,

23:19.898 --> 23:21.191
impossible to get.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.735
Except for places like China.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.406
Susan just got back from Beijing.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.159
(sighs)
We need to get that tea canister.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.123
MARK:
What is it you're giving her?

23:36.206 --> 23:37.791
Prussian blue.

23:37.874 --> 23:41.211
It'll help flush any toxic chemicals
in Mary's body.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.130
Toxic chemicals?

23:43.213 --> 23:46.174
Does that mean you know
what's been happening to her?

23:46.258 --> 23:49.052
-We're getting closer.
-(knocking)

23:49.136 --> 23:51.054
Hello. Mark, Susan,
can I steal you for a second

23:51.138 --> 23:52.222
to sign some paperwork?

23:52.305 --> 23:53.640
Of course.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.767
You probably only need one of us.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.394
I'll stay here with Mary.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.146
Um...

23:59.229 --> 24:01.565
Yeah.
Actually, I need both your signatures.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.316
It'll be real quick.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.902
I'll keep her company.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.321
I'm not going anywhere.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.825
All right.
Just right there at the top.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.827
Thank you.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.329
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've had that...

24:16.413 --> 24:18.790
Uh, there we go.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.375
(Conrad continues talking quietly)

24:26.882 --> 24:30.093
And if, uh, could give me the date.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.428
Nah, we're good. We're good.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.513
Never mind.
Thank you. Thank you.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.606
Do you have any reason to believe that...

24:42.689 --> 24:45.192
that Susan would
try to poison your daughter?

24:45.275 --> 24:46.276
(stammers softly)

24:47.861 --> 24:50.822
Um, uh, of course not.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.992
She's hard on her,
but she loves Mary like her own.

24:54.075 --> 24:58.163
We found traces of thallium in the tea
that Susan gives Mary.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.415
(stammers)
Sue gave Mary the tea,

25:00.499 --> 25:03.335
but I'm the one who got it
for her from her acupuncturist.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.421
I was just trying to help her feel better.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.174
The tea is supposed to calm her
and give her more energy.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.426
-This is all my fault.
-No. We're not pointing

25:11.510 --> 25:13.845
any fingers just yet, but...

25:13.929 --> 25:17.098
but we just need to know
how the thallium got in the tea.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.099
I don't know.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.352
It comes in sealed packets.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.770
Do you have one with you?

25:21.853 --> 25:25.273
I mean, we give it to her all the time.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.484
NIC:
I mean, I...

25:27.567 --> 25:30.445
(sighs) I mean, I can't read
any of these ingredients.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.571
These kind of alternative remedies

25:31.655 --> 25:32.781
are completely unregulated.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.782
There could be anything in there.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.200
We need to get this to the lab.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.118
My wife.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.788
She didn't do this.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.289
You have to believe me.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.844
(phone vibrating)

25:56.555 --> 25:58.056
(sighs)

25:58.139 --> 26:00.559
Please tell me you're on your way.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.102
They're ready to announce us.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.144
<i>I'm not, Nadine.</i>

26:03.228 --> 26:04.646
<i>I'm still at the hospital.</i>

26:04.729 --> 26:06.648
<i>I had to stay with my patient.</i>

26:06.731 --> 26:09.359
-I'm so sorry.
<i>-(sighs)</i>

26:09.442 --> 26:11.069
They're about to announce you
as my escort.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.070
I'm gonna look like

26:12.153 --> 26:13.488
<i>an idiot out there.</i>

26:13.572 --> 26:15.991
I don't even know what to say.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.578
Bye, Devon.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.249
So, they did find traces of thallium

26:24.332 --> 26:26.334
in the packets from your acupuncturist.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.336
We contacted the manufacturer,

26:28.420 --> 26:32.090
and they have submitted a recall
of the contaminated supplements.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.675
And I'll be okay?

26:33.758 --> 26:36.386
With a bit of rest
and a few more rounds of dialysis,

26:36.469 --> 26:37.387
you should be fine.

26:37.470 --> 26:40.807
(both sigh)

26:40.890 --> 26:42.058
I am so sorry.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.893
I should've listened to you.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.478
MARK:
Honey, this isn't your fault.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.190
I... I sent her to the acupuncturist.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.319
I told you the acupuncturist
was a bad idea.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.032
At least I'm not impossible
to please, like you.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.996
This is so embarrassing.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.709
Who eats their own hair?

27:07.792 --> 27:11.463
Look, stress can be triggering

27:11.546 --> 27:13.882
for these kinds of compulsion disorders.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.717
Cut back your hours.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.469
Take on fewer clients.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.554
Easier said than done, I think.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.765
And I will put you in touch
with a professional

27:21.848 --> 27:23.683
who specializes in trichophagia, okay?

27:23.767 --> 27:25.185
(chuckles softly)

27:25.268 --> 27:29.564
I've been so stressed and scared
someone would figure it out.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.942
I pushed everyone away.
(sniffles)

27:33.026 --> 27:35.070
All I had was my work.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.404
It paid off, but, uh...

27:36.488 --> 27:38.448
You were alone.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.535
I shouldn't have asked you
to stay with me.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.413
-You missed your ball.
-We all need support.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.416
I wanted to be here for you.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.921
Well, I'm okay now,
and you can still make it.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.591
It's too late.
I can't show up now.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.387
Hey. It's like you said,
everyone needs support.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.722
Late or not, your princess
wants you there.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.016
And, besides,

28:05.100 --> 28:08.019
it would be a shame
for that tux to go to waste.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.854
(chuckles)

28:14.609 --> 28:17.153
Thank you, Gemma.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.822
Hmm.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.657
Now, that is how you wear a tux.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.325
Well, if I remember correctly,

28:22.409 --> 28:24.744
you have a spectacular wardrobe yourself.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.997
I'm just popping in,
but I have a plus-one,

28:28.081 --> 28:29.332
if you're interested.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.418
You want arm candy.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.920
(laughs)
Are you offen... are you offended by that?

28:34.003 --> 28:35.505
Usually, yes.

28:35.588 --> 28:38.550
But I do have a dress
I've been wanting to wear,

28:38.633 --> 28:40.719
and I desperately need a night out.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.262
The whole night.

28:42.345 --> 28:44.180
So I will drive myself.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.682
Okay. It's a deal.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.767
Uh, see you there.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.269
Mm-hmm.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.275
(knocking)

28:55.358 --> 28:56.860
Hey.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.322
Wow.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.576
You in that dress
is exactly what I need right now.

29:04.659 --> 29:08.538
It's time for you to return the feeling.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.541
(sighs)

29:11.624 --> 29:14.586
-You want to talk about it?
-Eh.

29:17.088 --> 29:20.008
Being chief resident
is not what I thought it would be.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.926
You know, we don't have to go out.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.096
We can go home, get some wine,

29:25.180 --> 29:26.514
-relax.
-Mm.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.017
And lose a night dancing
with you in that dress?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.018
(grunts)

29:30.101 --> 29:31.019
(chuckles)

29:31.102 --> 29:32.854
Absolutely not.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.272
Mm.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.401
All right, but if you're
not fist pumping in a half hour,

31:55.455 --> 31:56.956
But I decided against it,

31:57.040 --> 31:59.292
because when a hospital
decimates departments,

31:59.375 --> 32:01.836
it loses prestige and status.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.777
he wouldn't be hypoxic.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.365
It's not.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.867
He also has tetralogy of Fallot.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.327

39:31.410 --> 39:33.120
often have other complex
congenital abnormalities.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.289
Which means he has less than
a five percent chance of survival.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.736

40:05.820 --> 40:09.156

40:09.240 --> 40:12.576
as to why we should probably
just get married.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.327
I mean, we're committed.
We should at least talk

40:55.411 --> 40:57.538
-about making it official.
-Listen,

40:57.621 --> 40:59.373
I-I love you deeply.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.083
I mean, you were my rock when I got fired.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.376
You pushed me to forgive my father.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.587
You gave me chickens.

41:04.670 --> 41:07.131
You will always make those
annoying sounds when you eat,

41:07.214 --> 41:09.550
and I'll probably never learn
to pick up my socks,

41:09.633 --> 41:10.968
-(laughs)
-...but nobody's perfect.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.012
What matters is that we just keep trying

41:13.095 --> 41:14.680
to make each other better.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.476
What matters is that we...

41:20.978 --> 41:22.938
...we belong together.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.358
Conrad.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.819
Wait, are you proposing to <i>me </i>now?

41:28.903 --> 41:31.655
Why do you think I'm saying
all this lovey-dovey stuff?

41:31.739 --> 41:33.282
And why do you think I've been

41:33.365 --> 41:36.327
carrying this thing around
in my pocket for weeks?

41:40.581 --> 41:44.460
Nicolette Marie Nevin,

41:44.543 --> 41:47.588
-will you do me the hon...
-(quietly): Yes.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.635
(both laugh)

41:55.429 --> 41:56.805
Are you sure?

41:58.307 --> 42:01.685
I have never been so sure
of anything in my life before.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.772
(laughs)

42:55.072 --> 42:57.032
