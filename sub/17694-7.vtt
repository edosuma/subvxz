00:03.170 --> 00:05.104
(snoring)

00:05.106 --> 00:06.772
¶¶

00:10.111 --> 00:12.444
(tires squeal)

00:12.446 --> 00:15.014
You don't have to do this.
I'll tell you anything you want.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.516
You look great in that dress.
You don't look fat at all.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.851
You made your point, Francine!

00:18.853 --> 00:20.185
(laughter)

00:20.187 --> 00:22.388
I hope you enjoyed
your kidnapping.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.858
That was just my fun way
to give you some exciting news.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.459
You've been elected

00:27.461 --> 00:31.030
to be in charge of this year's
C.I.A. calendar!

00:31.032 --> 00:32.798
Really?
I can't believe it.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.968
And to be clear, I pissed myself
out of happiness just now,

00:35.970 --> 00:37.569
not during
the kidnapping thing earlier

00:37.571 --> 00:38.804
that -- that wasn't scary.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.172
As you know, our calendar

00:40.174 --> 00:42.975
is the C.I.A.'S number-one
fundraiser.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.644
Selling calendars pays
for everything around here,

00:45.646 --> 00:47.679
including
printing the calendars.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.082
It's an enormous expense.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.384
Now be a dear
and help me with this.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.686
These are the steroids
officially endorsed

00:54.688 --> 00:57.856
by MTV's "Real World/Road Rules
Challenge."

00:57.858 --> 00:59.425
As per usual,

00:59.427 --> 01:04.229
I will be absolutely ripped
for my July spread.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.697
(sloop!)

01:05.699 --> 01:09.435
(screams)

01:09.437 --> 01:11.036
This is
the photo proof book.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.372
You'll store all your photos
and negatives in here.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.274
Guard this with your life.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.043
And also, it likes to wear this
tiny, little jacket on Sundays.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.279
-It does?
-Well,<i> I</i> like it to.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.680
Just give this
your all, Stan.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.382
You don't want
to mess up the calendar,

01:23.384 --> 01:25.617
or you'll never
live it down.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.020
What?
My calendar wasn't that bad.

01:28.022 --> 01:31.457
It was just 12 pictures of some
lady taken through her blinds.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.126
She had those big boobs!

01:37.398 --> 01:40.232
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:40.234 --> 01:43.769
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:43.771 --> 01:46.772
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:46.774 --> 01:50.509
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:53.280 --> 01:56.415
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:56.417 --> 01:58.817
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:58.819 --> 02:00.152
Aah!

02:01.422 --> 02:04.123
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:07.895 --> 02:09.661
I just felt so aimless.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.797
I was in a rut, Francine.
You get that.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.999
I do.
You know, once, I was in --

02:14.001 --> 02:15.167
I was telling a story!

02:15.169 --> 02:18.971
Can I finish one story
one time?!

02:18.973 --> 02:20.572
Thank you!

02:20.574 --> 02:24.243
After a ton of soul searching,
I found my new passion --

02:24.245 --> 02:26.445
getting my degree
in criminology.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.248
I'm so happy
you're going to college.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.849
Can<i> I</i> go to school today?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.285
You know, if you tried harder
in high school,

02:33.287 --> 02:35.487
maybe you could go to college
like Roger.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.656
I'm missing my PSATs
right now!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.858
Steve, you need to get serious
about school.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.094
Me, I worked my ass off
for this.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.595
Good for you, Roger.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.798
The name is Jeremy Neiderhoff,
college freshman.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.433
BRO: Neiderhoff!

02:48.435 --> 02:49.935
It's really great

02:49.937 --> 02:52.804
when you find something
you're passionate about.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.707
I'm happy for you,
but I'm also a little jealous.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.709
You know,
I never went to college.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.679
And look at you now --
driving someone else to college.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.681
(whistles)
Wow.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.253
(stately music playing)

03:16.130 --> 03:17.629
(music stops)

03:17.631 --> 03:20.566
(music continues)

03:20.568 --> 03:23.335
(music stops)

03:23.337 --> 03:26.305
(music continues)

03:26.307 --> 03:27.873
(music stops)

03:27.875 --> 03:31.076
(music continues)

03:31.078 --> 03:33.545
I got a Discovery card!

03:33.547 --> 03:35.380
Whoo!

03:35.382 --> 03:37.349
Look at all these cool things
you can buy

03:37.351 --> 03:39.051
with your
Discovery card points!

03:39.053 --> 03:40.586
Wow, look at this jacket!

03:40.588 --> 03:43.188
Francine, I quit college
to focus on my new passion --

03:43.190 --> 03:44.356
getting this jacket.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.358
Roger, it's really great

03:46.360 --> 03:49.328
when you find something
you're passionate about.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.929
I'm happy for you.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.699
But I'm also a little jealous.
I never owned a --

03:53.701 --> 03:56.268
You never owned a satin
credit-card jacket. I know.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.370
Have I told you
that story before?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.806
Uh, yeah.
Beep, beep. Let's go.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.281
Sir, thank you
for getting me an assistant.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.684
Don't thank me.
Have your assistant do it.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.055
Asher! I wanted the water
room-temperature

04:17.057 --> 04:19.891
but not<i> this</i> room.
I meant a slightly colder room.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.727
Oh, I'm so sorry.
i-I'll get an ice cube.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.362
That's your generation,
isn't it?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.063
An ice cube
will fix everything.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.065
Well, not this time.
You're fired.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.734
But before you go,
bring me an ice cube.

04:28.736 --> 04:32.537
That does sound nice.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.607
Sir, I'd like you to meet
the newest member of the C.I.A.,

04:35.609 --> 04:38.477
which makes him eligible
for the C.I.A.'s calendar --

04:38.479 --> 04:40.245
agent Tyrese Gibson.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.647
Thank you
for this opportunity.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.815
Now, I've been reviewing
some files,

04:43.817 --> 04:47.052
and I think I have a lead on
a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.722
Your eyes --
they are mesmerizing.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.291
Can I put a shirt on?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.793
I don't think you understand
why we brought you here.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.066
This is Dustin,
my new assistant.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.301
He's a flincher.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.636
-(grunts)
-Two for flinching.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.438
-(sneezes)
-Germs!

05:06.440 --> 05:09.474
How dare you not dive in front
of the proof book to protect it.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.643
It's like you don't believe
in this, or me.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.645
You've got bad energy, Dustin.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.947
All day, you've been
silently judging me.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.849
You're fired.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.455
Whoa. You think your dad
would hire me?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.424
'Cause I don't have
a lot going on

05:25.426 --> 05:29.928
since I lost my frisbee
in that scary bush.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.030
It'd be hell
to work for my dad.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.766
He has never once said
I did a good job.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.301
When I was a kid,

05:36.303 --> 05:38.537
my dad would always take me
to the same beach.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.541
So for father's day, I drew him
a picture of<i> our</i> beach.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.009
My bedtime story that night

05:44.011 --> 05:48.313
was a 45-minute critique
of my drawing.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.781
Well, if it were me,

05:49.783 --> 05:51.950
I would have drawn it
on a single piece of paper.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.354
I did. He tore it up.
That's how critical he is.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.657
And that day, I vowed
that if he ever made anything,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.192
I'd ruin it.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.194
And I forgot about that vow
for a long time

06:02.196 --> 06:04.329
'cause, you know,
I had other stuff going on.

06:04.331 --> 06:07.165
But now it's back
with a vengeance.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.802
Oh! So you're gonna try
to ruin his calendar thing.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.504
(mockingly) "Oh!"

06:12.506 --> 06:14.673
(normal voice)
Yeah. I'll become his assistant,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.508
and I'll help him
make the calendar.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.877
(chuckling) And then when
he's feeling all good about it,

06:18.879 --> 06:20.345
I'll destroy it!

06:20.347 --> 06:23.248
Babe, you're scaring me
more than the scary bush.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.151
(ominous music plays)

06:31.725 --> 06:34.860
BRO: Neiderhoff!

06:34.862 --> 06:36.328
How was school today,
Steve?

06:36.330 --> 06:37.896
You know I didn't go.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.931
I watched you and Mom
drink two bottles of wine,

06:39.933 --> 06:42.067
and now we're here,
and Mom's sleeping in the car.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.869
So, you want to go
watch your mommy sleep

06:43.871 --> 06:47.706
or help me break in
my Discovery card?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.008
I thought this was a stupid
choice when you said it,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.243
but I get it now.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.645
10 more minutes,
then we go shopping?

06:59.686 --> 07:01.386
Ooh, I'm sorry.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.255
We don't accept
Discovery card.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.957
We do take Visa, MasterCard,
American Express,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.592
Diners Club,
traveler's checks,

07:07.594 --> 07:10.462
even a gentleman's agreement
to come back and pay tomorrow,

07:10.464 --> 07:12.397
but no Discovery card.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.232
What?!
Let's get out of here, Steve.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.636
This place smells like farts,
anyway -- or it's about to.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.404
(grunts)

07:19.406 --> 07:22.707
Is there a store here that sells
paper towels and underwear?

07:25.145 --> 07:27.479
Discovery card
at a Tumi store?

07:27.481 --> 07:29.214
You have to be kidding me.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.116
This is Tumi.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.151
<i> Tu-mi.</i>

07:33.153 --> 07:34.419
Sorry. Geez.

07:34.421 --> 07:39.624
Tuuumiiiii!

07:39.626 --> 07:44.095
I guess Discovery card isn't
as widely accepted as I thought.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.897
Oh, you must be
the Discovery card people

07:45.899 --> 07:47.933
I've been hearing about.
Right this way.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.035
I think I know
what you're looking for.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.539
Steve, are you seeing
this door?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.478
Please, sir,
don't make this difficult.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.013
I'm going. I'm going.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.683
Aah!

08:04.685 --> 08:07.619
I guess I'll never get
that Discovery card jacket.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.988
MAN: Psst.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.290
I know a place
that takes Discovery card.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.592
(gasps)

08:16.129 --> 08:18.797
Hayley, I don't know why
you wanted this job,

08:18.799 --> 08:21.333
but I hope you're motivated
enough to handle it.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.805
Oh, I'm plenty motivated.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.173
What was that?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.141
I thought I heard you say
something pointedly,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.043
like you were plotting
to take someone down,

08:32.045 --> 08:34.946
someone close to you,
someone completely oblivious.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.616
-Nope.
-Okey-dokey.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.357
Oh, my God.
This is quite a production.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.125
Don't pretend
like you didn't know

08:47.127 --> 08:48.860
the C.I.A. calendar
is a huge deal.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.062
I don't think anyone
outside the C.I.A. knows.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.831
You mean the Muggles?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.966
We're all set up to shoot
"January" with Jackson.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.468
What?! No!

08:56.470 --> 09:00.505
Every year, Bullock goes
overboard with the steroids.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.874
We do July first and then
drop him off in the woods

09:02.876 --> 09:06.011
so he can work off
his aggression in isolation.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.312
(barrel clangs)

09:07.314 --> 09:10.315
Bullock love body!

09:10.317 --> 09:14.185
Muscle powder!

09:14.187 --> 09:17.322
(slurping)

09:17.324 --> 09:19.758
(grunting)

09:19.760 --> 09:22.093
All right, people, we're only
gonna get one of these.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.428
Bullock doesn't like the flash.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.529
(grunts)
(camera shutter clicks)

09:24.531 --> 09:26.031
Lightning box!

09:26.033 --> 09:27.365
Aah!

09:27.367 --> 09:29.100
Heads up.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.268
I said heads up.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.003
(camera shutter clicks)

09:32.005 --> 09:35.507
(screaming)

09:35.509 --> 09:37.275
(panting)

09:37.277 --> 09:38.877
Hayley, you saved my life.

09:38.879 --> 09:42.747
And ruined the perfect shot.
Way to go.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.382
Wha-- what are you doing?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.351
It's called a slow clap.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.253
Notice the speed
my hands are moving.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.423
That's how sarcastic
I'm being.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.225
(camera shutter clicks)

09:54.227 --> 09:55.894
Come on, Hayley.
Throw him a good one.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.597
-I'm hitting him in the chest.
-With the pointy part!

09:58.599 --> 10:00.899
Why don't we just Photoshop
a ball into his hands?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.934
Only amateurs use Photoshop.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.769
You don't know
what Photoshop is, do you?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.371
I don't have to know
what something is

10:06.373 --> 10:10.308
to not like it.
You think I know what hummus is?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.043
(camera shutter clicks)
Stan, listen.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.245
I've been tracking the
terrorists' cellphone chatter,

10:14.247 --> 10:15.914
and I think it's time
to go undercover.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.016
Sure, sure. Whatever.
Release the bull!

10:21.755 --> 10:23.054
Beautiful.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.990
Hayley, get this bull
out of here.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.501
Not so fast.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.169
You're a clown.
Make us laugh.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.138
Um...

10:41.341 --> 10:42.474
Aah!

10:42.476 --> 10:43.775
(laughs)

10:43.777 --> 10:45.710
I di--
I didn't think she could do it.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.349
Uh, we've already been
to this mall.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.851
No one takes Discovery card.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.686
Oh, we're not going here.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.188
For us Discovery card people,

10:57.190 --> 11:00.492
<i> this</i> is our mall.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.293
Starting...

11:02.295 --> 11:03.695
Right now,
this is our mall.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.463
¶¶

11:05.465 --> 11:08.366
This mall has remained untouched
since the '80s.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.468
It's perfect.
How can we ever repay you?

11:10.470 --> 11:13.138
Actually, I host
this singer-songwriter night...
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.073
-Uh-huh.
-...at the Coffee Cabana on...

11:17.010 --> 11:19.310
And a little for Roge.
(sniffs)

11:19.312 --> 11:21.346
(slurring)
Let's get shopping!

11:21.348 --> 11:23.448
A shower thermometer?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.483
This will eliminate
all the guesswork.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.819
Look at me, Steve.
I'm like a jockey...

11:27.821 --> 11:30.055
Who came four times!

11:30.057 --> 11:31.222
Whoa!

11:31.224 --> 11:32.824
I can't see it.
I can't se--

11:32.826 --> 11:34.325
Ohh!

11:34.327 --> 11:36.494
It's a (bleep) classic car.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.797
It's coming right out
of the (bleep) poster!

11:40.734 --> 11:43.001
These are compliments
of the gentlemen in the booth.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.170
-The California Raisins!
-The California Raisins!

11:45.172 --> 11:47.338
-We're cursed to live forever!
-We're cursed to live forever!

11:50.977 --> 11:52.977
(sighs)
The calendar is done.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.546
Hard to believe
that this proof book

11:54.548 --> 11:56.915
holds my entire vision inside.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.485
This must be what it's like
to hold a baby you love.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.554
(snoring)

12:08.061 --> 12:09.594
What are you doing
with my baby?!

12:09.596 --> 12:11.996
Um, i-i was just gonna
lock it up in the safe.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.666
Ah, good.
That's where babies go.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.836
¶¶

12:17.838 --> 12:20.138
It's here!
Steve, it's here!

12:21.742 --> 12:23.541
As good as it looks
on the outside

12:23.543 --> 12:25.877
is how scratchy it feels
on the inside.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.947
You can tell
the stitching is fishing line.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.882
It's perfect.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.552
My Discovery card bill.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.454
(gasps)

12:36.456 --> 12:38.923
Rag, take me away.
(inhales deeply)

12:41.061 --> 12:42.393
Oh, shit, bro.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.696
The A.P.R. on this card
is terrible.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.297
What are you gonna do
about this bill?

12:46.299 --> 12:48.933
You'll -- you'll never be able
to pay it back.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.769
I'm gonna ask
for a moment of silence,

12:50.771 --> 12:53.204
because Jeremy Neiderhoff
is dead.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.606
(marker squeaks)

12:54.608 --> 12:58.209
(sighs) Now I got to call
Mrs. Neiderhoff.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.744
(laughs)

12:59.746 --> 13:01.646
Oh, there's someone
on the other line, claire.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.414
It's probably Jeremy.
(cellphone beeps)

13:03.416 --> 13:04.616
Hello?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.484
Nooooo!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.753
Jeff, I got his book!

13:08.755 --> 13:10.421
Here.
Now I'm gonna go get my dad,

13:10.423 --> 13:11.990
and the moment
we walk in the door,

13:11.992 --> 13:13.324
you set the book on fire.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.826
The<i> photo</i> book.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.661
What other --
(scoffs)

13:16.663 --> 13:18.229
Yes, the photo book.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.564
I knew it.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.499
I can't wait to see
the look on his face

13:21.501 --> 13:23.802
when all his hard work
goes up in smoke.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.272
His hard work
is in the book.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.607
Dad, can you come upstairs
for a sec--

13:29.609 --> 13:32.110
Hayley, I wanted to discuss
your performance this week.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.578
And how disappointing
I've been?

13:33.580 --> 13:34.979
I've been really impressed.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.781
What? r-really?

13:36.783 --> 13:38.249
You worked your ass off.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.617
Don't think I haven't noticed.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.353
You've done a good --
no, a great --

13:42.355 --> 13:45.323
no, a good job.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.160
And I'm proud of you.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.696
Did he -- did he just say...?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.933
¶ The greatest words
that a girl could hear ¶

13:54.935 --> 13:58.369
¶ Well, my dad just spat 'em
right into my ear ¶

13:58.371 --> 14:02.006
¶ I've been waiting
for years and years to hear ¶

14:02.008 --> 14:04.542
¶ My dad, he's proud of me ¶

14:04.544 --> 14:06.711
Pose!
¶ I did a good -- no, great ¶

14:06.713 --> 14:08.346
¶ No, good job ¶

14:08.348 --> 14:10.014
¶ I did a good -- no, great ¶

14:10.016 --> 14:11.783
¶ No, good job ¶

14:11.785 --> 14:13.551
¶ I did a good -- no, great ¶

14:13.553 --> 14:15.653
¶ No, good job ¶

14:15.655 --> 14:18.790
¶ My dad and I
have had rough patches ¶

14:18.792 --> 14:23.695
¶ That's why Jeff's upstairs
with a book of matches ¶

14:23.697 --> 14:24.829
Oh, shit!

14:24.831 --> 14:26.397
(music stops)

14:26.399 --> 14:27.732
KLAUS:
Don't worry. I got this.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.900
(music continues)

14:28.902 --> 14:31.002
¶ My name is Klaus, and I -- ¶

14:31.004 --> 14:33.671
i-i, uh, uh -- oh, dang.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.008
Say something. Anything.
(music fading)

14:37.010 --> 14:39.477
I killed two teenagers!

14:39.479 --> 14:42.914
¶ I killed two teenagers ¶
(music continues)

14:42.916 --> 14:46.251
¶ I was hammered on bourbon
as I took a turn ¶

14:46.253 --> 14:50.421
¶ Then ditched the car
as my passenger burned ¶

14:50.423 --> 14:51.556
Oh, wait.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.426
¶ I killed three teenagers ¶

14:55.428 --> 14:58.263
¶ Three teenagers ¶

14:58.265 --> 15:03.067
¶ I killed three teenagers ¶

15:03.069 --> 15:06.237
Don't tell anyone.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.339
Jeff, don't!

15:08.341 --> 15:09.741
Burn, baby, burn!

15:09.743 --> 15:12.410
Roast in the flames of revenge,
Mr. "S."

15:12.412 --> 15:13.912
Put out the book.
Put out the book!

15:13.914 --> 15:15.079
-what?
-the water!

15:15.081 --> 15:17.081
I'm on it, babe.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.616
What are you doing?!

15:18.618 --> 15:20.451
I'll pee out the fire.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.186
You could have just
<i> used</i> the --

15:22.188 --> 15:25.089
babe, you know this thing
doesn't work when you talk.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.229
The whole book is destroyed.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.564
(liquid splashing)

15:33.566 --> 15:37.468
(moaning)

15:41.975 --> 15:43.474
(zipper zips)

15:43.476 --> 15:45.977
For the first time in my life,
my dad is proud of me,

15:45.979 --> 15:48.780
and I spoil everything
in five minutes.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.082
He can't find out
this proof book is ruined.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.617
I have to fix this.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.786
Babe, I don't think
this is fixable.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.788
Maybe I can re-create
the whole calendar.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.557
I mean, i-if I take new photos
of the agents,

15:59.559 --> 16:01.893
I can photoshop them
into the old backgrounds.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.061
Will you help me?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.595
(groans)

16:04.597 --> 16:06.931
(buzzes lips)

16:06.933 --> 16:09.067
(sighing)

16:12.172 --> 16:14.439
Is that a yes?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.673
Yeah.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.742
¶¶

16:23.917 --> 16:26.684
(screaming)

16:26.686 --> 16:28.686
(camera shutter clicks)

16:36.830 --> 16:38.262
(woman screaming)

16:38.264 --> 16:40.365
(camera shutter clicks)

16:53.380 --> 16:55.380
(camera shutter clicks)

17:06.826 --> 17:09.494
(screaming)

17:09.496 --> 17:10.795
(horse whinnies)

17:10.797 --> 17:12.063
(screaming)

17:12.065 --> 17:13.698
Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:13.700 --> 17:14.732
(screaming)

17:14.734 --> 17:16.034
Beautiful!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.335
(camera shutter clicks)

17:17.337 --> 17:18.803
(screaming)

17:24.844 --> 17:26.778
This is gonna work!

17:30.150 --> 17:33.518
BRO: Neiderhoff!

17:33.520 --> 17:35.019
Goodbye, old friend.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.189
You burned too brightly
for this world.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.492
(gulping)

17:41.494 --> 17:43.161
Mom, that's not
funeral behavior.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.396
(elurring)
<i>You're</i> not funeral behavior!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.398
(engine sputtering)

17:50.370 --> 17:53.504
We've got company.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.939
We're from Discovery card.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.874
It's standard practice
to inspect the body

17:56.876 --> 17:59.510
when there's a large
outstanding balance.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.016
He's ready now.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.388
Ugh! God, the smell!

18:10.390 --> 18:12.490
He must have been dead
for weeks.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.395
Oh, I almost forgot.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.464
This funeral was paid for
on the card,

18:19.466 --> 18:23.701
which earned Mr. Neiderhoff
this Discovery card beach towel.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.475
ROGER:
(muffled) Yay!

18:30.477 --> 18:32.877
Thank you. He would have wanted
to be buried with it.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.852
I'll be the coolest guy
at the beach.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.990
Smith, enjoy your big night,

18:45.992 --> 18:48.092
because tomorrow
we put away the calendar

18:48.094 --> 18:54.065
and start to focus on the
C.I.A.'S big night of magic!

18:54.067 --> 18:56.234
That was supposed to be
a smoke pellet.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.770
(breathing heavily)

18:59.772 --> 19:01.906
Hayley, did you remember
to bring my lapel pin?

19:01.908 --> 19:04.008
Don't worry.
I have it right here.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.144
Wait, this is the wrong pin.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.813
This is a big night.
I asked for my big-night pin.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.782
My big-night pin is bigger.
It has star-shaped stars.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.451
These are dot-shaped stars.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.453
There were so many
on top of the dresser.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.455
Uh, may-- maybe I should have
brought them all.

19:17.457 --> 19:21.259
You think?! I can't believe I
said you were doing a good job.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.793
You ruined this night

19:22.795 --> 19:25.463
by making it all about
bringing the wrong pin.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.964
(crying)

19:26.966 --> 19:30.134
Mr. "S," Hayley didn't ruin
this night for you.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.936
She saved it.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.839
Jeff, are you out of your mind?
This night is a disaster!

19:34.841 --> 19:35.873
Dots.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.109
Dots are too good for you.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.610
(gasps)
You take that back!

19:39.612 --> 19:40.811
I won't.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.647
-(gasps)
-You're a big jerk!

19:42.649 --> 19:45.349
For your information,
I destroyed your proof book,

19:45.351 --> 19:48.319
and Hayley worked her butt off
to re-create the whole calendar.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.122
She did it because she knew how
big of a deal this was for you.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.957
All she wants
is your approval,

19:52.959 --> 19:55.326
and all you ever do
is cut her down.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.861
I'm motivating her
to be better.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.230
Your daughter
is already amazing,

19:59.232 --> 20:01.966
and it's sad you've never
been able to see that.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.305
-Jeff?
-oh, hey, Mr. "S"!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.606
I need your help.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.680
Dad, w-what are you
doing here?

20:15.682 --> 20:17.982
I'm here to say
I'm sorry.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.684
Did Jeff tell you
about the calendar?

20:19.686 --> 20:22.486
Yeah, but what I'm sorry about
is this.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.524
I should never
have torn this up.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.327
It's a beautiful picture.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.528
For a kid.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.263
Thanks, dad.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.432
But you're missing
your big night.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.933
Jeff's got it covered.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.868
This is January.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.239
He's a football man,
and he goes really fast.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.840
Next slide.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.375
(chuckling) Oh!

20:44.377 --> 20:46.577
I wasn't here
when she did this one,

20:46.579 --> 20:49.180
but it looks like
a guy washing his truck.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.915
Maybe it was dusty or --

20:50.917 --> 20:52.083
next slide.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.018
MAN:
No one's asking you to do this!

20:54.020 --> 20:56.587
Oh, this guy was really nice.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.190
Wait, I think I<i> was</i> there
for the last one.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.291
Previous slide?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.193
