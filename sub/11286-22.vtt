WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.403
[knock on door]

00:03.469 --> 00:06.471
Hey, hey. Regine, do you have
those books I asked you for?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.709
‐ Yeah, they're right here.
‐ Oh, cool.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.110
Kyle, you're reading.

00:10.176 --> 00:14.915
What sort of mischief has
Curious George gotten into now?

00:14.981 --> 00:17.784
For your information, Magpie..

00:19.786 --> 00:22.122
...I have a date
with one of my investors.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.191
The princess of Saun‐Hwi.
Oh‐ho.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.462
And I'm reading up
on all the protocol

00:29.530 --> 00:31.932
for dating a woman of class..

00:31.998 --> 00:34.868
...because Lord knows
I've made some mistakes.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.574
Well, don't think of it
as a mistake.

00:40.641 --> 00:44.711
Think of it the way I do.
I don't!

00:44.778 --> 00:47.413
Regine, these books
are not on royalty.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.882
(Regine)
'Yes, they are.'

00:48.949 --> 00:52.352
You got Queeny, the Prince
of tides and the Fisher King.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.822
You know, Kyle,
I was thinking

00:55.889 --> 00:57.357
an interview with
an African princess

00:57.423 --> 00:59.292
will make a great
featureful flavor.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.935
Maybe I can interview
before you go on your date.

01:02.002 --> 01:04.037
Uh, sorry,
that won't be possible.

01:04.104 --> 01:07.007
Ashamed to introduce her
to your common friends?

01:08.308 --> 01:09.843
Well, there is that.

01:11.311 --> 01:13.814
And the fact that I don't know
where she's staying.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.583
For security reasons her
motorcade will be picking me up.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.885
Kyle, you know here in America

01:18.952 --> 01:21.187
when we don't wanna
be bothered with a guy

01:21.254 --> 01:23.389
we gives him
the wrong number.

Quick, Khadijah,
help us find the remote control

02:00.661 --> 02:02.402
it's premier night
for the seventh network

02:02.468 --> 02:04.070
and we need to tape it.

02:04.137 --> 02:07.040
Well, why don't you just press
record on the VCR?

02:11.912 --> 02:15.616
Oh, yeah and then we could start
churning our own butter too.

02:20.453 --> 02:22.956
Now, is there anything else
I can do for you?

02:23.023 --> 02:25.291
Yes, make us some popcorn.
Chop chop.

02:26.326 --> 02:27.828
[knocking on the door]

02:27.894 --> 02:29.930
Come on, Shorty,
you gotta go down there

02:29.996 --> 02:31.264
with me tomorrow night.

02:31.331 --> 02:33.834
Overton, man , this is the
biggest date of my life.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.937
Now, tell me, would you rather
have a date with a princess

02:37.003 --> 02:39.740
or hang out with your buddy
at a sweaty pool hall?

02:39.806 --> 02:42.576
I'd go to the sweaty
pool hall but..

02:42.643 --> 02:44.044
...that's just me.

02:45.311 --> 02:49.249
Okay,
who's done what to whom?

02:49.315 --> 02:53.920
Overton just got hustled out
of $200 down at Tug's pool hall.

02:56.823 --> 02:59.660
‐ I didn't get hustled.
‐ Yes, you did.

02:59.726 --> 03:01.467
This couple just pretended
they weren't good

03:01.535 --> 03:03.003
until the stakes
got really high

03:03.069 --> 03:05.806
and then they became
much better players.

03:07.708 --> 03:10.777
Overton, I hate to say it,
but you should have known better

03:10.844 --> 03:13.046
than to play
strangers for money.

03:13.113 --> 03:15.916
And in the future
if you hate to say something..

03:17.350 --> 03:19.953
...feel free
to just keep it to yourself.

03:22.388 --> 03:24.691
Maybe you should have kept
little money to yourself.

03:31.297 --> 03:34.835
Any way, where is my little
pumpkin pie?

03:34.901 --> 03:37.170
I need her joker like smile.

03:38.772 --> 03:40.173
[all laughing]

03:46.980 --> 03:49.315
I need that to heal my wounds.

03:51.384 --> 03:53.554
She's staying late
at drama class.

03:53.620 --> 03:56.489
Takes a little extra time
to get out of character.

03:58.559 --> 04:00.260
Well, truth be told.

04:00.326 --> 04:02.836
I won't find any confidence
till I go back down

04:02.903 --> 04:04.871
and beat those two
at their own game.

04:04.938 --> 04:07.508
Uh‐huh. You know, Obi,
if it's two hustlers

04:07.574 --> 04:09.409
you're gonna need a partner.

04:13.847 --> 04:15.582
Yep.

04:15.649 --> 04:18.351
That would be nice
but old King Turd over there

04:18.418 --> 04:21.922
has official business.

04:21.988 --> 04:23.423
I could go with you.

04:23.489 --> 04:26.492
I was pretty handy with
a pool cue back in the day.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.596
Mmm‐hmm. That's how she paid
for all my groceries in college.

04:31.665 --> 04:34.834
Hmm, hell, this should be easy.
I only need $200.

04:41.041 --> 04:43.610
Guess your flim‐flam friends
aren't gonna show.

04:43.677 --> 04:46.212
Might have to just chalk
this one out to experience.

04:46.279 --> 04:48.248
Shame on you, Khadijah.

04:48.314 --> 04:51.685
Whole path wings
we mortals dare not touch.

04:52.919 --> 04:55.589
You're right.
What was I thinking?

04:57.390 --> 05:01.334
Overton, we might have to just
run this game another night.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.505
Psst!
Turtle doves in a pear tree.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.975
‐ What?
‐ It's them right over there.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.877
Oh, well then, places.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.379
Hey, Overton,
wasn't last night somethin'?

05:13.446 --> 05:16.282
Marlo and I still can't believe
how lucky we got.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.152
Yeah, well, uh, I rather
not talk about that right now.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.522
I just brought my girlfriend
Khadijah down here

05:21.588 --> 05:23.123
to teach
how to play pool.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.592
Isn't that right, honey?

05:25.659 --> 05:30.396
‐ I don't like this part.
‐ Shh, baby sister.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.865
New to the game, huh?

05:31.932 --> 05:35.268
Well, you know, we might be able
to show you a few things.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.404
Yeah, Overton, what do you say
we just play a friendly game?

05:38.471 --> 05:41.942
It'll be a good way
for your girl to learn.

05:42.008 --> 05:46.479
Well, uh, okay,
but no wagering.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.850
Oh, betting?
This sounds like fun.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.285
Oh, it's a blast.
You'll love it.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.622
Oh, sweetie, could we?

05:58.458 --> 06:01.101
Well, alright.

06:01.167 --> 06:04.304
Well, how much would you
like to bet, Khadijah?

06:04.370 --> 06:07.641
A dollar or maybe two?

06:07.708 --> 06:12.078
Well, all I have is this
wad of twenties. Is that okay?

06:16.850 --> 06:19.586
So, uh, Your Highness‐‐

06:19.653 --> 06:22.355
Oh, please, call me Hellura.

06:22.422 --> 06:23.423
Are you sure?

06:23.489 --> 06:25.826
I command you.

06:25.892 --> 06:29.195
Okay. Um, well,
this‐this is cozy.

06:29.262 --> 06:32.298
Just me, you and..

06:32.365 --> 06:34.434
...your bodyguards too.

06:34.501 --> 06:37.037
Let's just pretend
he's not here.

06:37.103 --> 06:39.139
It might be easier
if he didn't have

06:39.205 --> 06:41.608
that oozy shape lump
under his jacket.

06:43.544 --> 06:45.045
Shall I taste your soup

06:45.111 --> 06:47.313
for you to make sure
it isn't poisoned?

06:47.380 --> 06:50.083
Oh, no, no.
Special agent Nators

06:50.150 --> 06:55.922
already done that
in the kitchen.

06:55.989 --> 06:59.459
Whoa‐Whoa‐Whoa! So, how do
we know that my soup is okay?

07:01.702 --> 07:04.605
Well, why would anyone want
to poison your soup, Kyle?

07:04.671 --> 07:06.406
They might've thought
that it was yours.

07:06.472 --> 07:09.209
I‐I mean not to say that
your soup should be poisoned

07:09.275 --> 07:10.611
but they might have..

07:10.677 --> 07:12.913
You know, um..

07:12.979 --> 07:16.182
...I'm really not all
that hungry after all.

07:16.249 --> 07:18.885
Your Highness, uh,
the Prince in exile from Waimi.

07:18.952 --> 07:20.887
He's on a phone for you.

07:20.954 --> 07:22.789
He's not in exile.

07:22.856 --> 07:26.660
I think that's what he wants
to talk to you about.

07:26.727 --> 07:28.361
Would you excuse me, please?

07:28.428 --> 07:29.930
She's moving.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.067
Man!

07:34.134 --> 07:36.136
This is nerve wrackin'.

07:36.202 --> 07:39.439
I suppose most men are jittery
around the princess?

07:39.506 --> 07:40.974
Oh, actually,
Her Highness usually dates

07:41.041 --> 07:42.643
uh, royalty and diplomats.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.611
They're a lot calmer than you.

07:46.547 --> 07:49.115
I just‐I just need to relax.
That's all. That's all.

07:49.182 --> 07:50.917
When she comes back,
you're gonna see

07:50.984 --> 07:52.452
an entirely different person.

07:52.519 --> 07:55.088
Prepare yourself
for the Barker magic.

07:56.657 --> 07:59.059
Why don't you just, uh,
suggest that the soup

07:59.125 --> 08:00.126
maybe poisoned again.

08:00.193 --> 08:01.668
She doesn't
get enough of that.

08:03.036 --> 08:04.605
Thank you.

08:14.748 --> 08:17.050
Don't tell me you smelled
the cheese and crackers

08:17.117 --> 08:19.820
from across the street.

08:19.886 --> 08:22.222
No. Actually I saw them
from my window.

08:24.958 --> 08:28.028
Well, did you see the limo
that picked Kyle up

08:28.094 --> 08:30.531
for his date
with the princess?

08:30.597 --> 08:33.466
I don't care about Kyle.
Was it a stretch limo?

08:34.467 --> 08:36.570
Hmm, were flags
on the hood.

08:36.636 --> 08:39.304
But you should have seen
the female attendants

08:39.371 --> 08:40.907
that dressed
the brother in silks

08:40.974 --> 08:43.208
and carried him out
on their shoulders.

08:47.347 --> 08:50.250
Princess, my ass.

08:50.316 --> 08:53.854
She probably can't even
get anybody executed.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.388
Oh, no,
she's the real thing.

08:55.455 --> 08:58.424
In fact, she and Kyle
are mentioned

08:58.491 --> 09:00.867
in the society section
of the paper.

09:03.704 --> 09:05.338
Get out of here.

09:16.182 --> 09:17.784
[laughing]

09:19.653 --> 09:23.156
Oh, get a life
and some fresh crackers.

09:23.223 --> 09:25.859
Hey, I'm not the pathetic
peeping Tom

09:25.926 --> 09:29.663
who was watching my grapes
from across the street.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.665
'Cause there's nothing
to do around here.

09:31.732 --> 09:36.302
Everybody's out playing pool
or dating royalty but me.

09:36.369 --> 09:38.872
I'm going to Jersey
to get me a tattoo.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.408
What?

09:42.475 --> 09:45.378
I'm going to Jersey
to get a leopard on my leg

09:45.445 --> 09:48.749
or a panther on my back
or tiger on my...whatever it is.

09:48.815 --> 09:50.450
It won't wash off.

09:51.952 --> 09:54.287
‐ You're serious.
‐ Yes.

09:54.354 --> 09:57.157
Well, you know, I've never seen
anybody get a tattoo before.

09:57.223 --> 09:58.358
Can I come?

09:58.424 --> 10:01.101
Well, I don't know,
little Ray‐Ray.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.471
It's kind of bloody.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.508
I don't know
if you can handle it.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.543
Well, please.
Seeing someone torture you

10:09.610 --> 10:12.145
with a needle
will be a treat.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.014
Well, then
this is your lucky night.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.016
Maybe I'll get
something pierced.

10:18.919 --> 10:22.188
Like your e‐ears.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.790
Lower.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.396
Let's go!

10:38.004 --> 10:39.439
[people applauding
and cheering]

10:41.341 --> 10:44.878
Alright, Khadijah. You've got
all the stripy ones in.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.647
Way to pool.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.618
Hold up now.
You see, this is the eight ball.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.654
You're gonna have
to pick out which pockets

10:53.720 --> 10:55.188
you wanted it
to go into..

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
...Sugar plum.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.792
Okay, sugar eyes.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.236
Gosh, this is harder
than choosing a movie.

11:06.172 --> 11:07.508
That one!

11:14.380 --> 11:15.882
[people cheering and applauding]

11:16.883 --> 11:18.051
You mean that's it?

11:18.118 --> 11:19.586
‐ You mean we win?
‐ That's right.

11:19.653 --> 11:22.723
Oh, this is the best streak
of beginners luck I've ever had.

11:22.789 --> 11:24.791
Yeah.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.260
Yeah, you really
took to the game.

11:27.327 --> 11:30.697
Mmm‐hmm.
I got to give you your props.

11:32.999 --> 11:36.269
Yeah. Well, uh,
we don't need your props.

11:36.336 --> 11:41.007
The 200 would do just nicely.
Bye‐bye.

11:41.074 --> 11:43.376
Come on, Overton,
I am on a streak, man.

11:43.443 --> 11:45.946
Wh‐What do you say
we go bet on some ponies?

11:46.012 --> 11:48.549
Hey, people, what'd you say
you test your luck again?

11:48.615 --> 11:50.416
Double or nothin'.

11:50.483 --> 11:51.618
Double or nothin', huh?

11:51.685 --> 11:57.123
Four hundred dollars,
that's a lotta money.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.392
Alright, girl, you're on.

11:59.459 --> 12:03.269
Hey, come on, Khadijah, you won
my money back, let's split.

12:03.336 --> 12:06.673
But I'm hot,
I tell you, I'm hot.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.809
Obie, she has
that look in her eye

12:08.875 --> 12:11.144
it's the same look
she had in Atlantic City

12:11.211 --> 12:12.412
when she lost everything.

12:12.478 --> 12:17.050
She almost sold Max's car,
with Max still in it.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.152
That's it, I'm getting you
out of here.

12:19.219 --> 12:22.889
Look, Phil, Marlo,
it's been fun, gotta go.

12:22.956 --> 12:28.128
Wow, just when I was gonna
suggest we play for $500..

12:28.194 --> 12:33.099
Five hundred dollars.
That's a lotta money.

12:36.269 --> 12:38.839
Rack 'em!

12:38.905 --> 12:42.576
Khadijah, Khadijah no,
that's Flavor's petty cash.

12:42.643 --> 12:44.377
No, it's not..

12:44.444 --> 12:45.445
...it's the rent money.

12:45.512 --> 12:47.681
Now, rack 'em!

12:54.521 --> 12:57.090
Hey, escort,
could you just move over

12:57.157 --> 12:59.425
so I can get just
the princess here, please?

13:03.269 --> 13:05.806
Picture this, my friend,
you're leavin'.

13:09.409 --> 13:12.078
Excuse me,
may I have your autographs?

13:12.145 --> 13:14.447
Most certainly.

13:14.515 --> 13:16.950
Who are you?

13:17.017 --> 13:18.619
Well, I'm the Princess, Hellura.

13:18.685 --> 13:19.753
Great, and you?

13:19.820 --> 13:21.688
Kyle Barker, funds manager.

13:21.755 --> 13:23.624
Thank you.

13:23.690 --> 13:26.059
You can keep that.

13:26.126 --> 13:32.065
Alright, my little pen pal,
you're leaving.

13:32.132 --> 13:34.735
‐ Okay, alone at last.
‐ Yes.

13:34.801 --> 13:38.471
Your Highness, Brian Plow,
National Sun, one question..

13:38.539 --> 13:41.207
Lesbian, yes or no?

13:41.274 --> 13:43.376
I'll take that as a yes.

13:47.514 --> 13:48.782
Yeah!

13:57.023 --> 13:59.259
As fast as you caught
on to the game

13:59.325 --> 14:01.334
I still think I should
explain this part.

14:01.401 --> 14:04.270
You see, as soon as
I get this eight ball

14:04.337 --> 14:06.573
into this corner pocket

14:06.640 --> 14:10.744
You lose $500.

14:10.811 --> 14:13.013
Understand?

14:14.014 --> 14:16.016
Just shoot.

14:30.697 --> 14:33.667
That's alright, honey,
you set me up.

14:33.734 --> 14:38.338
You want daddy
to bring it home, don't you?

14:38.404 --> 14:42.375
Alright, now just uh
take your time now, tiger lily.

14:42.442 --> 14:43.777
All you gotta do now

14:43.844 --> 14:48.448
is sink these five balls
in a row, without missing.

14:48.515 --> 14:50.483
Oh!

14:50.551 --> 14:52.553
Oh!

14:52.619 --> 14:55.188
You okay, Khadijah?

14:55.255 --> 14:59.593
Ow! I think I sprained
my wrist.

14:59.660 --> 15:03.203
Hey, what's with spillin'
the soda on the floor?

15:03.269 --> 15:09.275
Don't even try it.
I was sippin' through a straw.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.878
Well, how'd you like
to take your meals that way?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.547
Whoa! Just a minute.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.882
As much as I'd love
a good cat fight

15:15.949 --> 15:18.451
you need to take your shot
or forfeit the game.

15:18.519 --> 15:21.021
Oh, well, how am I supposed
to play like this?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.388
Oh, not very well.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.258
I'll tell you what, lemme
just take the shot for you.

15:25.325 --> 15:29.495
Oh, no‐no‐no‐no‐no.
This is mixed doubles..

15:29.563 --> 15:32.833
boy‐girl, boy‐girl.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.139
I can call a woman,
I can call my friend Maxine.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.974
Yeah, Maxine lives right
around the corner

15:41.041 --> 15:43.276
‐ I'll go call her.
‐ No‐no‐no‐no‐no‐no.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.511
You don't really think..

15:44.578 --> 15:46.780
we gonna let you
call in your ringer?

15:46.847 --> 15:52.719
Now you want another woman,
I'll pick one...her.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.593
Huh?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.937
Why would a woman who thinks
of a one night stand

16:04.004 --> 16:05.806
as a long term commitment
do something

16:05.872 --> 16:08.742
this permanent to herself?

16:08.809 --> 16:13.647
It's creative expression.
Lets the world know who I am.

16:13.714 --> 16:17.784
Exactly how much of the world do
you expect to see this tattoo?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.485
That's it, right there.

16:19.553 --> 16:21.555
That panther.

16:21.622 --> 16:25.225
It's sleek, it's black,
it's poised, ready to attack.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.160
Why don't you get
a heart, huh?

16:27.227 --> 16:28.695
Or, or a rose, you know..

16:28.762 --> 16:30.130
...something
a little more feminine.

16:30.196 --> 16:31.532
You're right, Regine.

16:31.598 --> 16:34.935
How about a big old uterus,
right here on my shoulder?

16:35.001 --> 16:37.203
Is that feminine enough
for you?

16:43.577 --> 16:45.345
Okay, I'm ready for you.

16:45.411 --> 16:46.980
‐ Oh ho!
‐ Good luck, Max.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.982
Whoo! Chill out!

16:49.049 --> 16:51.084
It's a tattoo, not a C‐section.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.792
[laughing]

16:58.859 --> 17:00.567
[groans]

17:09.175 --> 17:11.944
You know it's too bad they
didn't have the lamb kebabs

17:12.012 --> 17:13.113
they're really quite good.

17:13.179 --> 17:15.715
The lamb is a sacred animal
in my country.

17:15.781 --> 17:19.886
I've had one as a pet
ever since I was three.

17:19.953 --> 17:21.253
Oh.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.424
Um, yeah, would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

17:24.490 --> 17:27.393
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

17:27.460 --> 17:29.696
To the restroom,
if that's okay?

17:29.763 --> 17:32.265
He's moving.

17:32.332 --> 17:35.401
Marvin, take Mr. Barker
here to the restroom.

17:35.468 --> 17:38.038
Oh, come on, I really don't
think that'll be necessary.

17:38.104 --> 17:39.372
I'm afraid it is.

17:39.439 --> 17:40.941
We have to have
total surveillance

17:41.007 --> 17:45.445
while you are with the princess.

17:45.512 --> 17:49.015
Perhaps we should get our
check and call this an evening.

17:49.082 --> 17:50.383
Something's wrong?

17:50.450 --> 17:51.518
Well, yes.

17:51.585 --> 17:53.587
I mean, this evening
has been a disaster.

17:53.654 --> 17:55.421
When I'm not being frisked
or photographed

17:55.488 --> 17:57.023
I'm saying something stupid.

17:57.090 --> 17:59.760
And I'm sorry, but I've
been going to the bathroom

17:59.826 --> 18:03.804
all my life and I have yet
to take a buddy.

18:03.870 --> 18:06.540
Do you think I like being
surrounded by bodyguards

18:06.607 --> 18:08.208
24 hours a day?

18:08.274 --> 18:10.243
Sleeping in a drafty palace

18:10.310 --> 18:12.913
fleeing the country
every time there is a coup.

18:14.414 --> 18:16.082
I suppose not.

18:16.149 --> 18:18.418
I wanna do things
regular people do.

18:18.484 --> 18:21.387
Go to the malt shop,
cruise the strip

18:21.454 --> 18:23.323
or have a burger
at Arnold's.

18:23.389 --> 18:24.357
[laughing]

18:24.424 --> 18:26.259
Wait, wait, wait,
let me guess..

18:26.326 --> 18:28.361
...they show Happy Days
in your country.

18:28.428 --> 18:29.730
And Grease too..

18:29.796 --> 18:30.997
[laughing]

18:31.064 --> 18:33.299
But that's not enough.

18:33.366 --> 18:35.669
It's really too bad
this didn't work out, Kyle.

18:35.736 --> 18:39.072
I was really starting
to like you.

18:39.139 --> 18:41.508
‐ You were?
‐ Yes.

18:41.575 --> 18:43.577
You see,
all I ever meet a dignitary

18:43.644 --> 18:45.646
is who are so afraid
of being assassinated

18:45.712 --> 18:50.751
that they never want
to get close to anyone.

18:50.817 --> 18:55.255
Kyle, would you like it,
if I got rid of everyone

18:55.321 --> 18:59.693
and it were just you and I
for the rest of the evening?

18:59.760 --> 19:03.970
I'd love that.

19:04.037 --> 19:05.205
I can't do it.

19:05.271 --> 19:08.809
But isn't it wonderful,
just thinking about it?

19:08.875 --> 19:10.611
'Come on, Kyle.'

19:10.677 --> 19:16.416
Stay, and we'll rock
around the clock.

19:16.482 --> 19:18.251
[arguing indistinctly]

19:18.318 --> 19:19.686
No, no, wait!
No, no.

19:19.753 --> 19:23.857
I pick Mary Tyler Poppins
and that's who were going with.

19:23.924 --> 19:26.527
Hey, now,
hey, hey!

19:26.593 --> 19:28.595
Come on, Khadijah,
I can't do any worse

19:28.662 --> 19:30.130
than you
with a bum wrist.

19:30.196 --> 19:34.267
Sinclair, you almost put your
eyes out when we played Jacks.

19:34.334 --> 19:35.435
Enough stalling.

19:35.502 --> 19:38.038
Now you got two choices,
we take the money now

19:38.104 --> 19:43.610
or she can take your turn
and we'll take the money then.

19:43.677 --> 19:45.879
Okay, Sinclair.

19:45.946 --> 19:48.014
Give it your best shot.

19:52.853 --> 19:55.922
They're all just so pretty,
I don't know which one to hit.

19:55.989 --> 19:57.724
[laughing]

20:02.536 --> 20:03.670
Whoa!

20:03.737 --> 20:07.240
[applauding]

20:07.307 --> 20:09.309
‐ That's right, that's right.
‐ Right!

20:12.613 --> 20:14.548
[cheering]

20:14.615 --> 20:16.650
[applauding]

20:22.856 --> 20:24.925
[cheering]

20:28.529 --> 20:29.930
[laughing]

20:35.869 --> 20:37.671
Well done, missy.

20:37.738 --> 20:41.542
Excuse me, you might wanna
back it up, honey.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.949
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yes, baby.

20:53.019 --> 20:57.958
Uh, eighth ball...corner pocket.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.660
That's it?
No trick shot?

20:59.726 --> 21:02.969
Well, I wasn't gonna showboat
but since you ask.

21:14.715 --> 21:16.683
[cheering]

21:20.420 --> 21:22.388
Yes!

21:22.455 --> 21:27.060
Yeah, cool cash,
keeps the swelling down.

21:29.229 --> 21:32.666
I guess this teaches you that
deceit and duplicity don't pay.

21:32.733 --> 21:35.001
Although, in this case,
they did pay for us.

21:35.068 --> 21:36.469
[laughing]

21:36.537 --> 21:37.538
Whoo!

21:37.604 --> 21:39.305
Oh yeah, and by the way.

21:45.411 --> 21:47.413
She's not really my sister.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.616
[laughing]

21:54.087 --> 21:56.957
You know, even though
we got off to a rocky start

21:57.023 --> 21:58.992
I really had a great time
this evening.

21:59.059 --> 22:02.202
I hope we can get together
again soon. Goodnight.

22:02.268 --> 22:04.938
I'll pass your thoughts on
to the princess.

22:05.005 --> 22:08.742
She really enjoyed herself,
I know I did.

22:08.809 --> 22:10.310
Steve, one question..

22:10.376 --> 22:14.180
Now, suppose I would have tried
to put a move on the princess‐‐

22:14.247 --> 22:17.751
I'd have broken your back
in three places.

22:17.818 --> 22:19.485
S, I made the right choice?

22:19.553 --> 22:21.154
‐ Hoo hoo.
‐ Whoo.

22:24.525 --> 22:25.992
'Woo‐hoo!'
