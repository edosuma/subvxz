WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:06.207
Previously on Zoo... We're not
going to kill all worlds animals.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.309
With no hope of
bringing them back.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.777
It's over son! But sir!

00:09.810 --> 00:11.512
Command this is alpha!

00:11.545 --> 00:12.646
(grunts)

00:12.680 --> 00:16.717
Noah objective is a go,
Repeat: Noah objective is a go!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.386
She just collapsed!

00:18.419 --> 00:19.187
I should have known.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.121
On what?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.356
She's pregnant.
Any idea who the father is?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.225
I have a good idea!

00:24.258 --> 00:28.062
You created Glaciers disease...

00:28.096 --> 00:29.497
My daughter is affected.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.165
And she has the ghost gene?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.700
I'm afraid so...

00:33.534 --> 00:35.503
The Noah objective is on...

00:35.536 --> 00:36.546
They've cleared the air space!

00:36.570 --> 00:37.505
Plane's are doing what
they're meant to be doing!

00:37.538 --> 00:40.474
The gas is going to kill
all the animals, man!

00:40.508 --> 00:41.275
And Clementine...

00:41.309 --> 00:42.410
What have you done?

00:42.443 --> 00:45.213
It will all be cleared to
you and to the entire world.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.747
Very soon!

00:51.852 --> 00:53.254
(grunting)

00:54.455 --> 00:55.523
JACKSON: Damn you!

00:55.556 --> 00:56.857
You killed them all!

00:56.890 --> 00:59.427
(grunts) ABRAHAM: Calm
down, Jackson.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.295
We got to find a
way out of here.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.331
ABRAHAM: Let's look over here.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.602
MITCH: I got to
get to my daughter.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.438
We'll figure it out, Mitch.
Well, that's

01:10.471 --> 01:12.340
easy for you to say.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.407
The serum cured you.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.808
Clem still has the ghost gene.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.244
Once they drop that
gas over Maine,

01:16.277 --> 01:17.811
she's got less than
12 hours to live.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.481
Why would the Shepherds help us
make a cure to save the animals

01:20.514 --> 01:23.484
and then drop a gas
that will kill them?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.725
Check these out.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.695
What... what is that?

01:37.898 --> 01:40.468
What the hell?!

01:40.501 --> 01:42.136
What's going on?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.172
(grunting)

01:46.540 --> 01:48.376
ABRAHAM: Logan?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.280
What happened to you?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.649
Some kind of animal
gets in here.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.186
I barely made it
into this crevice.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.421
Otherwise I'd be dead.
Well, you're just

02:00.454 --> 02:02.423
one lucky son of a bitch,
then, aren't you? How did

02:02.456 --> 02:03.691
the animal get inside?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.693
(alarms wailing) No, no,

02:05.726 --> 02:08.262
no, no. It's feeding time again.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.697
That gate opens.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.931
They come in here.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.301
This cavern is their food bowl.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.670
As soon as that gate opens,
I say we run like hell.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.606
All right. That's crux...
The southern cross.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.650
Which means south is that way.
The Shepherd compound

02:20.674 --> 02:22.286
was at the southernmost
tip of the island.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.577
And that's where the plane is.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.946
(grunting) Abe,
what are you doing?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.248
We need to protect ourselves.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.653
Logan, give me your arm.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.189
Leave him. Best idea ever. No.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.833
He's gonna slow us down.
I'm not leaving him.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
MITCH: Less talking,
more running.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.261
JAMIE: Come on! Now we go.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.162
(growling, roaring)

02:47.735 --> 02:49.437
Come on!

02:49.470 --> 02:50.738
(panting)

02:50.771 --> 02:52.706
Come on. Come on, you got this.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.742
(growling continuing)

03:03.417 --> 03:05.519
JACKSON: You got to keep moving.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.721
We're in Section K.
What the hell is Section K?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.799
Reece said it's where the
Shepherds keep their mistakes.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.991
Mistakes? Yeah.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.469
They have mistakes?
DARIELA: Apparently.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.727
And a lot of them.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.795
(roaring in distance)

03:14.828 --> 03:16.264
Okay, look, get back.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.432
Move.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.468
Get back.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.506
All right! Go! We need to move!
We need to move now.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.840
(siren chirps)

03:26.874 --> 03:29.643
MAN (on P.A.): Freeze!
Stay right where you are.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.512
Stop!

03:31.545 --> 03:33.281
Do not move!

03:33.314 --> 03:34.982
Do not move!

03:35.015 --> 03:36.517
Command,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.553
we got a problem at Section
K, gate three.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.589
(roaring)

03:49.497 --> 03:50.464
Aah!

03:50.498 --> 03:51.432
What the hell are those things?

03:51.465 --> 03:52.809
They're the Shepherds' mistakes.
(screaming)

03:52.833 --> 03:54.034
Move, move! Let's go, come on!

03:54.067 --> 03:56.270
(screaming)

03:59.573 --> 04:00.984
Those wolf things are
taking over the compound.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.443
We have to secure the plane.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.578
Let's just get out of here.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.616
The Shepherds might be on board.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.650
(alarm blaring)

04:10.351 --> 04:11.552
DARIELA: Mitch!

04:11.585 --> 04:13.321
Hey, hey. Mitch, wait!

04:24.898 --> 04:26.667
The Triple-Helix animals...
They're gone.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.336
The serum.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.808
Oh... what happened in here?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.037
Trotter.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.606
Oh, thank God it's you.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.641
I've been hiding under
my bunk for hours.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.742
What happened?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.812
Hey.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.582
Your Shepherd friends took
everything back to their lab

05:14.615 --> 05:16.025
and then all hell broke loose.
Is there

05:16.049 --> 05:18.586
anyone else on the plane?
No, just us.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.053
I'm gonna go start pre-flight.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.356
Ow! You know, for a mercenary,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.358
you have the pain threshold
of a first grader.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.627
A mercenary?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.472
After all we've been through,
that's all you think I am?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.498
I can think of a lot of
other things to call you.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.837
Genomic fossil serum's gone.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.772
Mitch,
I know that the serum cured me,

05:38.806 --> 05:40.641
but it killed my father.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.476
Are you sure it's safe for Clem?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.645
The drug that Reiden gave
Clem is a neuroprotectant.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.448
It'll stop the side
effects from the serum.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.617
Reiden did something
good for once.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.051
Trotter's safe, plane's secure.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.153
Once that gas drops,
we'll have less than 12 hours

05:53.186 --> 05:55.923
to get the serum to her.
We are not leaving here without it.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.658
You want to go back out there?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.126
That is exactly
what we're gonna do.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.094
Hold that there. Ow!

06:01.128 --> 06:03.864
What was my father doing,
working with the Shepherds?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.633
Trying to heal the animals.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.735
Did those hybrid wolves
look healed to you?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.002
This doesn't make any sense.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.638
What was he doing here?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.673
DARIELA: If we're
going after the serum,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.708
we'll need a way
into that bunker.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.644
(line ringing) Somebody answer.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.945
Come on, just answer.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.947
Answer, answer, answer.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.716
Come on, come on, come on.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.720
Hey. Somebody there?

06:26.754 --> 06:29.790
Hey. Hello?

06:29.823 --> 06:30.891
Hello?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.893
Hey, yeah, uh,

06:32.926 --> 06:34.928
I'm looking for Audra Lewis?

06:38.466 --> 06:39.633
Sir...

06:39.667 --> 06:41.769
Audra Lewis... do you know her?

06:41.802 --> 06:45.639
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.942
Why... What-what happened?

06:48.976 --> 06:52.446
The safe zone was
attacked by animals.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.548
I'm sorry.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.983
Audra and Justin were killed.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.187
I liked them both.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.422
They were good people.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
Where's... where's Clementine?

07:06.694 --> 07:09.229
Nice people.
Audra in particular.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.932
Sir, where is my daughter?

07:11.965 --> 07:15.603
Clem was evacuated
along with my son David.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.471
They took all the children.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.673
Okay. Evacuated where?

07:19.707 --> 07:20.917
Where'd they...
Where'd they take 'em?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.676
I don't know.
Dozens of temporary shelters

07:22.710 --> 07:24.177
were set up along the coast.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.547
Okay.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.015
(alarm starts wailing) Um...
what...

07:28.048 --> 07:29.950
what is that?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.018
What's-what's that noise?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.553
I'm sorry. I have to go.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.154
They're dropping the
gas, thank God.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.656
Are those the Noah
Objective planes?

07:35.689 --> 07:38.826
Hey! No, no, don't-don't go!

07:42.930 --> 07:45.533
I'm sorry, Mitch.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.668
She could be anywhere.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.736
We're gonna find her.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.003
And get her the serum. How?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.640
Well, to start: we found
a way into the bunker.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.586
Oh, my God.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.857
Those razorback
wolves are no joke.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.659
They didn't leave anybody alive.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.828
Let's just find that
serum and get out of here.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.140
Hey, Moe.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.344
Clashes between civilians

09:04.377 --> 09:06.847
and the military
continue in Moscow,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.749
where, nearly 14 hours

09:08.782 --> 09:11.151
after the release
of the TX-14 gas,

09:11.184 --> 09:14.855
animals continue to roam the
streets, unaffected.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.590
As tensions flare...
(TV clicks off)

09:16.624 --> 09:18.826
So the gas didn't
kill the animals?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.595
And we're out of the 12-hour
window Robert talked about.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.031
It should have affected the
animals in Russia by now.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.800
And what about the people like
Clem, with the ghost gene?

09:26.834 --> 09:29.202
Why no reports of human deaths?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.238
Because people die all the time.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.841
Almost 250,000 people
die every single day.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.375
That's just life.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.045
So, unless all 2.2 million
people with this ghost gene

09:38.078 --> 09:40.881
drop dead in Times Square
at the exact same time,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.916
it's not gonna be on the news.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.221
When did you start
paying attention?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.290
I'm smarter than I look.
You'd have to be,

09:50.323 --> 09:52.225
just to hold a fork.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.128
Look, just because we didn't
leave you to die in that cave

09:55.162 --> 09:56.272
doesn't mean we have forgotten

09:56.296 --> 09:59.132
about how you sold
us out to Davies.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
I get it.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.170
But I can make it
up to you guys.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.773
How?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.841
I can find Clementine.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.210
You?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.179
Me.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.815
How can you do that?

10:14.848 --> 10:15.892
Because I have
military contacts,

10:15.916 --> 10:19.286
and not the regular channel
kind that Dariela has.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.923
I just need to make a few calls.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.058
I just need a phone.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.127
What's in it for you?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.797
I'm not a saint,
but I pay my debts.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.899
You're fooling yourself

10:31.932 --> 10:34.334
if you think this will get
you back on Jamie's good side.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.203
Well, maybe, maybe not,
but it certainly beats

10:36.236 --> 10:37.805
sitting here watching the news.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.208
Jamie threw you off

10:41.241 --> 10:43.376
this plane. I can promise,

10:43.410 --> 10:45.212
if you're not being
straight with us,

10:45.245 --> 10:48.048
I will make you wish for
something as kind as that.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.219
Copy that.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.929
Anything?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.231
No. Nothing.
I'm gonna check upstairs.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.772
Who are we kidding?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.240
The serum's not gonna be here.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.242
Hey, we are going to find it.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.144
Then we're going
to get to Maine,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.079
and you,
me and Clem are gonna...

11:19.112 --> 11:21.782
do whatever people do in
Maine, okay?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.952
Yeah.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.261
What is this thing?

11:37.965 --> 11:39.967
It's old X-ray film.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.371
This must be the
stuff that Robert took

11:44.404 --> 11:46.439
from Pierce's place in Holbeach.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.276
These are X-rays of

11:49.309 --> 11:52.312
the original Triple-Helix
animals from 1895.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.783
Look at this.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.387
It looks like...

12:00.420 --> 12:04.191
Pierce knew that his X-rays
were affecting the animals.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.528
He developed a chemical compound

12:08.561 --> 12:13.133
to... sterilize the
Triple-Helix animals.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.079
Which is why the
environmental events stopped.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.306
But if he sterilized them,
they couldn't reproduce.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.408
How'd the Triple-Helix survive?

12:21.441 --> 12:25.012
It's possible that the
Triple-Helix was only quieted

12:25.045 --> 12:26.446
in some of the animals,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.015
silencing its
genetic instructions.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.784
Hence, the... genomic fossils.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.486
So, Triple-Helix went dormant.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.488
Until the Mother
Cell woke it back up.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.858
(footsteps approaching)

12:37.891 --> 12:40.260
Found it.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.428
(sighs) Hey.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.196
(alarm sounding)

12:43.230 --> 12:45.408
FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Perimeter
breach in southeast sector.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.434
Oh, come on.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.336
(alarm blaring)

12:49.369 --> 12:51.371
Perimeter breach detected.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.080
(animals growling)

13:01.214 --> 13:03.216
Oh, my God.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.052
They're gonna break
down the fence.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.519
(barking and growling)

13:06.553 --> 13:08.355
Where did all those
hybrids come from?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.023
I don't know.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.993
If they storm that runway,
the plane can't take off.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.962
If we don't get that
power up to 100%,

13:14.995 --> 13:18.398
get that fence working,
they're coming straight for us.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.941
(low whooshing)
Okay, it's working.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.418
The system's redirecting
power back to the fence.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.112
(computer chirps) I found these...
flash drives.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.481
JACKSON: Unbelievable.
Jackson, what is it?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.117
This is the data from one
of my father's experiments.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
It looks like he was
working on the TX-14 gas

13:39.186 --> 13:40.320
long before he met Davies.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.989
You know how the neutralizer

13:42.022 --> 13:43.290
made it so the poison only

13:43.323 --> 13:45.258
targeted the animals? Yeah.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.732
Well, it looks like he was working
on an alternate neutralizer.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.262
Alternate how?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.164
This neutralizer
isn't going to make it

13:51.198 --> 13:53.200
so that the gas is safe for humans.
It's...

13:53.233 --> 13:55.178
going to make it so that
the gas is safe for animals.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.104
That's insane.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.372
Why would your father
want to target humans?

13:59.406 --> 14:00.874
I have no idea.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.910
It doesn't make any sense.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.916
What were the Shepherds doing?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.952
(low growling)

14:18.558 --> 14:20.627
(computer chirps)

14:24.564 --> 14:26.366
You guys should
probably head back.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.468
Fence back on?

14:28.501 --> 14:29.636
Almost.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.372
Well,
we're not going without you.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.441
Mitch, come on.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.376
Mitch, let's go.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.912
Listen, guys,
if there's another power surge

14:38.946 --> 14:41.214
and that fence fails while
we're out there in the open

14:41.248 --> 14:44.451
or-or while the plane's
taxiing, we're toast, okay?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.286
Just need a couple more minutes.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.488
Get back to the plane,
tell Trotter to fire it up.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.990
You got the serum, right?

14:50.023 --> 14:50.991
It's in the bag.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.392
Take these.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.465
There might be some info
on 'em about the Shepherds.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.029
Take it.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.999
I'll be fine.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.402
Hey, no, Jackson.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.604
South exit. It's faster.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.640
Be quick, huh? Yeah.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.148
(door opens)

15:22.622 --> 15:24.557
(door squeaks and shuts)

15:24.591 --> 15:27.027
(computer chirps, growling)

15:31.464 --> 15:34.034
(loud growling)

15:38.371 --> 15:40.073
That's right.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.109
Clementine Lewis.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.346
Yes, yes, age 11.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.548
Hold on.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.418
I have somebody who
needs to confirm this.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.254
Hi.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.489
Could you repeat that?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.525
Uh-huh.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.264
Okay. I'll be sure to tell him.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.568
His intel's good.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.238
I told you guys...
I pay my debts.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.605
He wanted me to tell you

16:12.639 --> 16:15.475
this was your last chit and...
This is important...

16:15.508 --> 16:17.477
You should go screw yourself.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.746
(laughs)

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
And now he has paid his debt.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.652
That's how my world works.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.654
So are we good?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.424
Only one person can
answer that question.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.460
She's not here.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.333
But this is most
definitely a start.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.645
We found the genomic
fossil serum.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.414
And we got Clem's location.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.183
She's at a power plant
outside Portland.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.551
Oh, that's amazing.
Mitch is two minutes behind us.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.054
We have to head for Clem
the second he gets back.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.622
Let's get this
bird ready to fly.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.357
Hey, you still got those drives?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.393
Yeah. Let's see if
there's anything on 'em.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.060
(phone ringing)

17:08.095 --> 17:09.762
Hello.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.631
MITCH: Been meaning
to tell you something.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.633
You made the right
call in New Brunswick.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.734
(barking, loud thudding)

17:15.768 --> 17:17.304
(growling)

17:17.337 --> 17:20.307
I couldn't leave Jamie there,
but you knew we had to.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.419
(barking, rattling) You knew the mission
was more important than any one person.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.078
ABRAHAM: What's happening?

17:25.112 --> 17:25.811
We're coming to get you.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.579
No. No, you're not.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.548
(loud thudding, growling)

17:28.581 --> 17:30.783
I'm trying to get this
fence up and running,

17:30.817 --> 17:34.354
but I've got a pack of wolfish
things outside the door,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.356
and it's not looking
too good for me.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.590
(loud thudding and growling)

17:37.624 --> 17:39.459
You guys come, we're all dead.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.627
We can handle them.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.495
You know I'm a selfish
son of a bitch.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.707
If there was any chance of me
making it out of here alive,

17:44.731 --> 17:45.665
don't you think I'd take it?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.334
You're the leader of this team!

17:47.367 --> 17:48.668
So why are you questioning me?

17:48.701 --> 17:50.703
(loud growling)

17:50.737 --> 17:52.639
(loud thudding, growling)

17:52.672 --> 17:55.675
You got about nine
hours at the most

17:55.708 --> 17:57.520
to get that serum to Clem.
(loud growling, thudding)

17:57.544 --> 17:58.678
Mitch?

17:58.711 --> 17:59.646
Abe, listen to me, okay?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.214
I've...

18:01.248 --> 18:02.815
(loud thudding)

18:02.849 --> 18:04.684
I've been...

18:04.717 --> 18:07.620
a less than...
stellar... father.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.290
(loud thudding, growling)

18:10.323 --> 18:11.791
There's an understatement, huh?

18:11.824 --> 18:13.593
(growling) I just want to do...

18:13.626 --> 18:15.628
If I can just do one thing,

18:15.662 --> 18:18.665
one... great thing for her

18:18.698 --> 18:20.733
before I die...

18:20.767 --> 18:22.735
Maybe... (thudding, growling)

18:22.769 --> 18:24.637
Maybe make the last thing

18:24.671 --> 18:26.639
I do in this world
saving her life...

18:26.673 --> 18:28.308
(growling, loud thudding)

18:28.341 --> 18:31.211
You made the right
call in New Brunswick.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.164
I need you to make it again.
(growling, thudding)

18:36.349 --> 18:39.752
(barking)

18:39.786 --> 18:42.489
Okay.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.324
I will.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.394
I do need you to promise
me that you guys'll...

18:47.427 --> 18:49.429
you guys'll look after Clem.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.698
(growling, thudding)

18:51.731 --> 18:54.801
You're her family now.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.636
(thudding and rattling)

18:56.669 --> 18:59.406
You guys... are her family now.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.908
(rattling, growling)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.414
Tell Jamie...

19:07.447 --> 19:09.449
(growling, loud thudding)

19:13.586 --> 19:15.288
Well, just tell her thanks.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.689
Tell her thank you.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.559
I will.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.195
I promise.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.363
(loud thudding, growling)

19:23.396 --> 19:25.265
I know you will.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.568
(computer trilling, chirping)

19:28.601 --> 19:31.771
FEMALE VOICE: Southeast
sector perimeter secured.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.273
(loud thudding and rattling)

19:33.306 --> 19:34.707
Now get that bird in the air.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.282
(beep)

19:42.315 --> 19:45.218
Trotter... close the ramp.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.586
We're good to go.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.855
(explosive pops, growling)

19:48.888 --> 19:50.257
I win.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.824
(growling, rattling)

19:51.858 --> 19:55.762
(growling)

20:04.937 --> 20:06.939
(loud, bellowing growl)

20:10.510 --> 20:12.845
(loud growling, barking)

20:12.879 --> 20:14.681
Mitch!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.716
(barking and
growling over phone)

20:48.080 --> 20:49.416
(sighs)

20:49.449 --> 20:51.351
These flash drives are a bust.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.685
We can try to check the files,

20:52.719 --> 20:54.587
but...

20:54.621 --> 20:55.855
Where's Mitch?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.857
(sighs)

20:57.890 --> 20:59.792
He called,

20:59.826 --> 21:01.994
and...

21:02.028 --> 21:04.397
the hybrids...

21:04.431 --> 21:08.267
They were after him, and they...

21:09.802 --> 21:11.804
And... what?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.475
Um...

21:18.411 --> 21:19.812
Did you leave him there?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.549
Jamie...

21:23.883 --> 21:26.553
Jamie... What are you talking about?
Where is he?

21:28.488 --> 21:30.590
Trotter, turn the plane around.
We have to go back.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.625
Trotter, maintain course.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.362
Abraham, what have you done?

21:35.395 --> 21:36.563
Jamie,

21:36.596 --> 21:38.665
he's gone.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.901
He wanted us to be safe.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.637
He wanted us to
get to Clementine.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.440
And he was willing to die
to make sure that happened.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.576
He wanted me to tell you

21:49.609 --> 21:51.611
thank you.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.747
It's... I...

21:54.781 --> 21:56.783
(crying)

21:58.518 --> 22:01.488
How could you let him?

22:01.521 --> 22:04.357
JACKSON: He knew.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.760
When he told us to leave the
lab, he knew the hybrids

22:07.794 --> 22:10.096
were there.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.654
(crying softly)

22:37.123 --> 22:39.125
(sniffling)

22:42.995 --> 22:44.997
(crying)

22:46.999 --> 22:48.568
We have to finish.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.869
We have to get to Clem.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.738
That's all that matters now.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.640
We have to do it for Mitch.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.814
(crying)

23:08.755 --> 23:10.757
(seabirds crying)

23:20.500 --> 23:23.470
Our contact said Clem was
moved here after the attack.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.472
Yes, but with how many others?

23:25.505 --> 23:28.140
We have 20 minutes to find Clem.
So you guys check this area.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.209
Jamie, let's go this way. Okay.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.079
Sorry, we're looking for a little girl.
11 years old.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.648
Her name's Clementine Lewis.
WOMAN: I'll take a look.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.750
(indistinct chatter)

23:43.089 --> 23:45.725
Hey. Is that her?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.760
I think so.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.030
Hi. Clementine?

23:51.063 --> 23:53.600
Yeah? I'm Jamie.
This is Jackson.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.001
We're friends of your dad's.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.637
Where is he?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.742
Uh...

24:02.775 --> 24:05.612
Your dad, uh,
made this for you, okay?

24:05.645 --> 24:07.747
It's a medicine that
you need to take.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.750
It turns out that there's still
part of your Glazier's disease

24:10.783 --> 24:12.785
that-that we need to fix.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.855

39:40.846 --> 39:42.981
After this final graduation
ceremony, teachers

39:43.014 --> 39:44.883
and students alike
will say good-bye.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.818
Like other elementary
school in the country,

39:46.852 --> 39:50.188
is facing immediate closure
as there are no more children

39:50.221 --> 39:52.434
to fill them. the government
and private companies alike,

39:52.458 --> 39:53.992
The Lost Generation has entered

39:54.025 --> 39:55.994
its tenth year with
no end in sight.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.963
NEWSWOMAN: Here they come.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.230
Stand back.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.975
NEWSMAN: How does it feel...
NEWSWOMAN: How does it feel...

40:00.999 --> 40:03.869
(air raid siren blares)

40:05.771 --> 40:06.838
MAN: Hybrid animal attacks.

40:06.872 --> 40:07.973
Bay and Midland counties.

40:08.006 --> 40:08.974
Level four alert.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.677
Secure all pets and livestock.

40:13.011 --> 40:13.979
That's nowhere near us.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.080
Nothing to worry about.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.583
Onward to ice cream.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.817
(chuckles)

40:18.850 --> 40:21.953
Ah, almost forgot.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.857
This came in the
mail for you today.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.698
From Uncle Jackson.

40:34.766 --> 40:35.967
Whoa!

40:36.001 --> 40:37.102
Is that a hybrid spike?

40:37.135 --> 40:40.906
Yes, but I'm sure all the
venom has been cleaned off.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.909
Although it is an
inappropriate gift

40:43.942 --> 40:44.910
for a ten-year-old.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.512
WOMAN: Abraham.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.914
(thunder rumbling)

40:48.947 --> 40:50.181
I'll be there in a minute.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.483
Okay.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.984
Come on.

41:00.058 --> 41:00.959
We know each other, don't we?

41:00.992 --> 41:02.794
We once did.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.663
Who are you?

41:04.696 --> 41:06.240
NEWSWOMAN: Fatalities
from hybrid attacks

41:06.264 --> 41:09.200
have increased at an alarming
rate in the tri-county area.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.570
The IADG is dispatching
personnel...

41:11.603 --> 41:14.105
This problem with the
hybrids is getting worse.

41:14.139 --> 41:17.609
I'm no longer involved in
solving these things anymore.

41:17.643 --> 41:20.211
That's because you know
there's only one person

41:20.245 --> 41:21.680
who can solve this problem.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.649
Yes...

41:23.682 --> 41:25.116
but Mitch Morgan is dead.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.487
No, he's not.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.858
But we went back to...

41:32.891 --> 41:34.059
Pangaea?

41:34.092 --> 41:35.561
He's not there.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.494
Neither are the Shepherds.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.163
They haven't been
there for a long time.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.298
I know exactly where he is,

41:40.331 --> 41:41.900
but I need your
help to get to him.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.535
Who are you?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.649
How do you know about the
Shepherds and Mitch Morgan?

41:46.638 --> 41:47.873
Because I'm his daughter.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.310
It's me.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.546
Clementine.
