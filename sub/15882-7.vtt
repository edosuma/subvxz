Combat is just a bunch of men
in a tight space

19:41.556 --> 19:42.889
with flashing lights
and loud noises.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.558
- Like...
[imitating bombs]

19:44.684 --> 19:45.892
- Just like this.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.519
- Yeah, you'll fit right in
at home.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.646
- It's gonna be great.
Oh, here it is.

Oh, can't stop it.
Can't stop it.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.150
- Go, Crandall.
Sergeant Crandall.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.318
Crandall, Crandall, Crandall.
And hold it.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.486
- What?
- Hold it.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.696
- Gotta do?

19:57.822 --> 20:00.115
- And hold it right there.
- Whoo!

20:00.241 --> 20:01.867
- I'm a robot.
- Robot.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.327
Excuse me there,
young man.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.871
Have you ever thought about
joining the United States Army?

20:05.997 --> 20:07.747
It's...
Oh, oh, excuse me.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.208
I will, uh, talk to you two
later... pardon me.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.925
- What's all this?

20:19.051 --> 20:22.137
- This is your lucky night.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.599
I wanna be your fantasy.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.934
Whatever you want me to do.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.895
Whatever you wanna do to me.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.981
You just tell me
your naughtiest fantasies, Phil,

20:33.107 --> 20:36.610
and you'll get it.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.986
- Seriously?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.030
- Seriously.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.825
- Like, for realsies?
- For realsies.

20:43.951 --> 20:49.456
- Well, how about we call up
your friend Erica...

20:49.582 --> 20:51.583
Aah!

20:51.709 --> 20:53.126
[Thud]

20:54.378 --> 20:56.338
- Good night, everybody!
Good night.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.089
Thank you for coming out.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.092
- ♪ I'm gonna do
my one line here ♪

21:01.218 --> 21:03.386
- Oh, yeah.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.390
- Finally, the dog licks me,
by the way. What did you say?

21:07.516 --> 21:09.684
- "Levi, get outta here.
You broke the contract!"

21:09.810 --> 21:11.811
- Verbal contract
with the animal.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.481
What is that? You could just
lock him in the bathroom!

21:14.607 --> 21:16.483
- I couldn't do that 'cause it
was a training moment for him.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.943
- It was a training moment
for me too.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.819
I learned never to go
to your house again.
