<i>from you,</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:37.074
<i>like for the bridge of the</i>
<i>nose, it's just really flat.</i>

18:37.157 --> 18:38.033
- I wanted to give
it a different texture.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.035
I've never
tattooed a demon before.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.371
<i>- Having to pull</i>
<i>these textures</i>

18:42.454 --> 18:45.999

the toughest ask for the team.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.131

The woman's face is beautiful.

<i>Where you lose me</i>

18:58.345 --> 18:59.847
<i>The demon to me</i>
<i>is really tonal.</i>

18:59.930 --> 19:01.390
<i>It has kind of a messy feel</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:03.559
<i>to it, and there's</i>
<i>some contrast issues.</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:04.852
- In the stuff that comes off

19:04.935 --> 19:07.104
the cheek, which
would be a horn or whatever,

19:07.187 --> 19:09.982
<i>that's a huge missed</i>
<i>opportunity for some texture.</i>

19:10.065 --> 19:12.734
<i>But I like the additions</i>
<i>that you made, creating this</i>

19:12.818 --> 19:14.236
<i>forked tongue down the middle,</i>

19:14.319 --> 19:16.572
<i>and the drips that</i>
<i>drip down over the skull.</i>

19:16.655 --> 19:19.741
Being creative and adding
to something is a great move.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.370
- Let's take a look at
the master's tattoo. Steve.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.372
- You get so many
different tones of dark.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.584
<i>The really deep, inset</i>
<i>blackness in the eyes,</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.377
<i>and then those</i>
<i>little dark pits</i>

19:30.460 --> 19:31.920
<i>of even darker, richer black.</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:34.298
<i>This thing really</i>
<i>has a lot of depth to it.</i>

19:34.381 --> 19:35.966
<i>- This has a ton of texture.</i>

19:36.049 --> 19:37.342
<i>You can feel what's going</i>

19:37.426 --> 19:38.969
<i>on in here if you</i>
<i>run your finger over it.</i>

19:39.052 --> 19:41.680
Giving this to your
team made them step up.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.516
It was a true test.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.729
- It is now time to determine

it would be

21:09.768 --> 21:12.229
- Josh's is really just
stamped in there perfectly.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.231
I saw he hits it.
- I say he does too.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.191
- Unanimous.
- Congratulations, Josh.

21:16.274 --> 21:19.528
You have matched your coach,

Moving on to Team Anthony,

let's look at
Jason versus Anthony.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.954
{\an8}- Little details of the line

make a strong difference to me.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.375
- Yes.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.751
- Like the front fangs
on Anthony's, they have that

21:34.835 --> 21:36.503
<i>realistic jarred tooth look,</i>

21:36.586 --> 21:38.046

{\an8}<i>- If you get into</i>
<i>detail for detail,</i>

22:05.991 --> 22:07.826
{\an8}<i>I think Anthony definitely</i>
<i>outshined him</i>

22:07.909 --> 22:09.286
{\an8}<i>in a few details.</i>

22:09.369 --> 22:10.996
- For sure. But Juan's
looks more like a wolf.

22:11.079 --> 22:15.083
- Juan's a much fiercer,
darker, tougher image.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.918
<i>- But Anthony's looks slicker.</i>

22:17.002 --> 22:19.463
- Yeah.
- For me, Juan takes it.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.757

- Juan definitely hit it.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.549

Let's look at
Roly versus Steve.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.438
{\an8}In a design like this,
it's tough to match the coach.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.774
{\an8}<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you look at Steve's tattoo,</i>

22:38.857 --> 22:40.650
<i>it's rendered beautifully,</i>

22:40.734 --> 22:41.943
<i>it's textured, it's detailed.</i>

22:42.027 --> 22:44.654
<i>Roly has a little bit</i>
<i>of the similar tonality</i>

22:44.738 --> 22:46.114
<i>going on throughout it.</i>

22:46.198 --> 22:47.699
- I'm really missing
the richness in these eyes.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.993
I'm looking for the eyes
and the nose of this skull

22:50.077 --> 22:53.288
{\an8}<i>to be punched in, to</i>
<i>separate that design element</i>

22:53.371 --> 22:54.790
{\an8}<i>from the lady's face.</i>

22:54.873 --> 22:55.999
- I think he did a great job.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.167
As far as you could take this

22:57.250 --> 22:58.960
without seeing what I'm doing.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.253
To me, he hit this as much as

23:00.337 --> 23:01.379
anybody in the room
would hit this.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.964
- His is definitely
darker than mine,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.716
but he's the king of darkness,
you know what I'm saying?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.135
I have more of a soft
approach to tattoos.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.971
- The skull is cool,
but I'm not a big fan of

23:10.055 --> 23:10.972
<i>how he did this woman's face.</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:13.141
- The level of expertise,
showing texture,

23:13.225 --> 23:14.518
I don't think really hits it.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.019
- For this complicated,
crazy design, Roly

23:16.103 --> 23:18.355
did try to match his coach.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.773
- I can't do that, man.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.650
All right, Roly,
that does mean that you

23:21.733 --> 23:25.862
did not match your coach,
and you're up for elimination.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.449
All right, let's look
at Jeremy versus Steve.

{\an8}<i>man, the sloppiness</i>
<i>that we see</i>

{\an8}<i>in some of the demon</i>
<i>is just not gonna cut it.</i>

23:35.872 --> 23:38.667
{\an8}- I don't find
texture in Jeremy's whatsoever.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.212
{\an8}<i>Based on that, immediately</i>
<i>it's not a match to the coach.</i>

23:42.295 --> 23:44.005
- That's my vote.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.591

35:12.318 --> 35:13.194

didn't like it, so.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.530

off when great tattooers have

35:22.954 --> 35:24.205

the other people in the room.

<i>this thing is really smooth.</i>

37:05.431 --> 37:07.558

37:10.394 --> 37:13.022
weird to think that sharks have
this, like, definitive chin.

But you have this center line

37:20.863 --> 37:22.490
- Also,
the placement of the fins.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.760
How did you feel about
getting this challenge today?

37:42.843 --> 37:43.970
- I'm very limited
to what I could really draw,

37:44.053 --> 37:46.472
like, on the spot.

37:46.555 --> 37:48.140
It usually takes me a day or
two to draw something perfect.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.684
So, this is something I
could draw that was easier

37:49.767 --> 37:52.395
for me to actually pull
off a tattoo that's finished.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.814
- There's a lot
of things going on here.

<i>slender face, it's</i>
<i>really short and really wide.</i>

37:58.943 --> 38:00.361
But what's throwing me here is

38:00.444 --> 38:02.113
the way you choose
to color this thing.

38:02.196 --> 38:05.366
You put the yellow as the light
source, but the light source is

38:05.449 --> 38:07.827
<i>everywhere, but then the front</i>
<i>of the face isn't yellow.</i>

38:07.910 --> 38:09.537
- This is a low-rider
panel paint job.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.746
You've got red stripes,
and red panels,

38:10.830 --> 38:13.207
<i>and yellow stripes,</i>
<i>and yellow panels.</i>

38:13.290 --> 38:14.500
I don't really like
the color placements.

38:14.583 --> 38:17.753
- Just the fact you
don't count the bottom teeth

38:17.837 --> 38:22.133
in between the canines,
that's just mind-blowing to me,

38:22.216 --> 38:23.259
to have seven teeth.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.802
- But they're all straight.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.262
- Yeah, straight to the
garbage. That's where those go.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.723

credit for going for it.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.058
You can play safe day,
but he really swung for it.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.435
And obviously missed a little

38:32.518 --> 38:33.769
bit here, but he's
got fight in him, you know?

38:33.853 --> 38:35.730
People don't think he's
fighting because he's quiet,

38:35.813 --> 38:37.189
and he keeps to himself,
but the dude's fighting.

38:37.273 --> 38:41.068
- All right, guys, it is time
to determine who's going home.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.903

38:42.987 --> 38:44.321
we're looking for today in this

38:44.405 --> 38:46.198

the freehand ability to just

38:46.282 --> 38:48.409
draw something on the skin
and have it be appealing.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.370
- Are we agreed that
Jason and Deanna are safe?

38:51.454 --> 38:53.998
- I am.
- You good with that?

38:54.081 --> 38:55.583
- I'm good with that.
- I think Roly's was pulled off

38:55.666 --> 38:56.876
with more
finesse than Deanna's.

38:56.959 --> 38:57.626

38:59.336 --> 39:01.714
if it can swim,
if it can slither, okay.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.591
It's real.
Shark, not swimming.

39:03.674 --> 39:07.511
That's that. It's honest,
fair judging across the board.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.139
- All right, Jason and Deanna,

39:10.222 --> 39:12.808
you guys are
safe from elimination.

It's a complete miss.
And for that, Jeremy.
