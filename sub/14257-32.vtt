01:15.431 --> 01:16.765
HURRY, RAPHAEL.

01:16.766 --> 01:19.369
WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.038
WE'RE TOO LATE.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.043
THE VIDEO STORE
IS CLOSED.

01:24.044 --> 01:25.645
GREAT. NOW, WE'LL
HAVE TO PAY

01:25.646 --> 01:27.281
AN EXTRA DAY'S RENTAL
ON THIS MOVIE.

01:27.282 --> 01:28.716
HEY, THAT'S COOL.

01:28.717 --> 01:32.222
<i>I WOULDN'T MIND
WATCHING THE
RADIOACTIVE SALAMANDER</i>

01:32.223 --> 01:34.958
<i>THAT NIBBLED NEW YORK
A FEW MORE TIMES.</i>

01:35.895 --> 01:37.530
WHAT THE HECK?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.236
THE TURTLES.

01:42.237 --> 01:44.005
IT'S GENERAL TRAGG.

01:44.006 --> 01:45.942
WHO INVITED HIM OVER?

01:53.487 --> 01:55.790
I'LL HANDLE THIS,
DUDE.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.498
HEY, NO FAIR.

02:01.499 --> 02:03.468
DON'T TELL ME
WE'RE BEING HAUNTED

02:03.469 --> 02:05.604
BY THE GHOST
OF GENERAL TRAGG.

02:05.605 --> 02:08.776
COULDN'T BE.
LAST I HEARD,
HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

02:08.776 --> 02:12.448
YEAH, BUT IN
DIMENSION X, NOT HERE.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.418
OH, THAT MEANS
KRANG'S
MESSING AROUND

02:14.419 --> 02:16.219
WITH HIS DIMENSIONAL
PORTAL AGAIN.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.722
COME ON.

02:17.723 --> 02:19.992
IF WE CAN CONTACT
THE NUTRINOS,

02:19.993 --> 02:22.362
THEY MIGHT HAVE
SOME CLUE OF WHAT
KRANG'S BEEN UP TO.

02:22.363 --> 02:24.700
SURE, WE'LL JUST
DIAL LONG DISTANCE

02:24.701 --> 02:27.304
AND ASK
FOR THE AREA CODE
FOR DIMENSION X.

02:27.305 --> 02:28.671
NO SWEAT.
I'VE BEEN WORKING

02:28.672 --> 02:31.676
ON A PAN-DIMENSIONAL
PORTAL OF MY OWN.

02:31.677 --> 02:34.380
THIS IS BOGUS, RIGHT?

02:34.381 --> 02:36.483
NO, IT'S THE REAL THING.

02:36.484 --> 02:39.822
OF COURSE, I HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY TESTED
IT YET, BUT...

02:39.823 --> 02:42.158
ANYBODY GOT
ANY CHEWING GUM?

02:42.159 --> 02:43.761
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
INSTILLING ME

02:43.762 --> 02:45.797
WITH A WHOLE LOT OF
CONFIDENCE, DONATELLO.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.369
WHAT IN BLAZES HAPPENED,
SHREDDER?

02:49.370 --> 02:52.106
WHY DID YOU BRING
OVER GENERAL TRAGG?

02:52.107 --> 02:55.078
WHY ARE YOU
FOOLING AROUND
WITH MY PORTAL?

02:55.079 --> 02:58.850
AND WHY DIDN'T
HE MATERIALIZE FULLY?

02:58.851 --> 03:00.852
THE TELEPORTER
IS A NEWER VERSION

03:00.853 --> 03:03.623
ON OUR OLD
TRANSDIMENSIONAL PORTAL.

03:03.624 --> 03:06.595
ONLY NOW, IT WILL
TELETRANSPORT
MATERIAL OBJECTS

03:06.596 --> 03:08.764
TO A PREDETERMINED
LOCATION.

03:08.765 --> 03:12.537
I HOPE ALL THIS ISN'T
TOO MUCH FOR YOU
TO FOLLOW, KRANG.

03:12.538 --> 03:15.141
I'M ONE BIG BRAIN,
REMEMBER?

03:15.142 --> 03:16.777
CONTINUE.

03:16.778 --> 03:20.683
I'VE DISCOVERED THE LOCATION
OF SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR

03:20.684 --> 03:22.284
EVER SINCE I LEFT JAPAN.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.389
AND NOW,
IT'S WITHIN MY GRASP.

03:25.390 --> 03:27.626
HERE WE GO, GANG.

03:27.627 --> 03:30.630
I'VE GOT ALL
6 FINGERS CROSSED.

03:30.631 --> 03:33.101
SOMETHING SEEMS
TO BE INTERFERING

03:33.102 --> 03:35.404
WITH THE
TRANSDIMENSIONAL
RECEPTION.

03:38.242 --> 03:42.314
ARE YOU SURE IT'S SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT, SHREDDER?

03:42.315 --> 03:44.985
QUE PASA?

03:46.187 --> 03:49.191
LOOKS LIKE
ANCIENT JAPAN!

03:49.192 --> 03:51.161
SHREDDER'S PORTAL
MUST BE KNOCKING

03:51.162 --> 03:53.665
MY TRANSDIMENSIONAL
SIGNAL OFF TRACK.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.167
CHECK IT OUT.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.003
THAT LITTLE DUDE'S
FACING OFF

03:57.004 --> 03:59.673
AGAINST THOSE
HUMONGOUS HOGS.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.009
<i>NOW, RONIN,</i>

04:01.010 --> 04:04.514
<i>YOU WILL PAY
FOR DISOBEYING THE SHOGUN.</i>

04:04.515 --> 04:08.887
BE WARNED. YOU
ARE NO MATCH FOR ME.

04:08.888 --> 04:10.290
3 AGAINST ONE.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.192
WE SHALL SEE.

04:12.193 --> 04:16.130
WHOA! TALKING PIGS
AND RABBITS!

04:16.130 --> 04:19.469
I FIND THAT A LITTLE
HARD TO SWALLOW.

04:19.470 --> 04:21.706
NOT LIKE TALKING
TURTLES, RIGHT?

04:21.707 --> 04:23.776
ARE THEY MUTANTS LIKE US?

04:23.777 --> 04:25.211
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:25.212 --> 04:27.515
THIS MUST BE SOME
KIND OF ALTERNATE EARTH,

04:27.516 --> 04:29.518
WHERE ANIMALS,
NOT HUMANS,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.253
BECAME THE DOMINANT
SPECIES.

04:37.597 --> 04:40.300
MAN, THIS DUDE IS GOOD.

04:42.605 --> 04:44.140
TURTLE GUARDS, EH?

04:44.141 --> 04:47.144
<i>I SUPPOSE THE SHOGUN'S
COWARDLY SON</i>

04:47.145 --> 04:50.049
LORD BISSEN SENT YOU.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.017
MELLOW OUT, BUGS.

04:55.624 --> 04:57.794
COME BACK
AND FIGHT,
FLOPPY EARS.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.236
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

05:11.915 --> 05:14.852
YOUR SWORDSMANSHIP
IS EXCELLENT.

05:14.853 --> 05:18.791
NOW LET US TEST
THE QUALITY
OF YOUR BLADE.

05:20.327 --> 05:22.530
NOW, WHO WILL CHALLENGE ME?

05:22.531 --> 05:24.533
I WILL, DUDE.

05:27.938 --> 05:30.441
SUCH SUPERB TECHNIQUE,

05:30.442 --> 05:32.845
SUCH MASTERY OF FORM,

05:32.846 --> 05:33.947
SUCH...

05:33.948 --> 05:36.116
DELICIOUS TASTE.

05:36.117 --> 05:39.622
WHAT STRANGE STYLE
OF FIGHTING IS THIS?

05:39.623 --> 05:42.459
I WOULD CALL IT
SLAPSTICK.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.462
I SURRENDER TO YOU.

05:44.463 --> 05:46.465
PLEASE SPARE MY LIFE,

05:46.466 --> 05:49.235
AND TEACH ME
THIS SLAPSTICK.

05:54.811 --> 05:57.916
THIS DEVICE
IS FAR FROM PERFECT.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.986
WELL, SO ARE YOU.

05:59.987 --> 06:02.422
DON'T WORRY, I'LL FIND
THE PROBLEM AND FIX IT.

06:02.423 --> 06:04.692
PROMISES, PROMISES.

06:05.761 --> 06:08.798
MY NAME IS USAGI YOJIMBO.

06:08.799 --> 06:11.268
THAT MEANS
RABBIT BODYGUARD.

06:11.269 --> 06:15.108
<i>I AM A RONIN,
A MASTERLESS SAMURAI.</i>

06:15.109 --> 06:16.810
HE'S NOT ONLY
FROM MEDIEVAL JAPAN,

06:16.811 --> 06:18.947
BUT ALSO FROM
AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE.

06:18.948 --> 06:20.783
SO, NATURALLY,
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

06:20.784 --> 06:23.287
WHAT STRANGE CASTLE
IS THIS?

06:23.288 --> 06:26.023
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A CASTLE.

06:26.024 --> 06:28.360
IT'S MORE
LIKE A SEWER.

06:28.361 --> 06:31.966
IT IS QUITE, UH,
PICTURESQUE.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.302
WE MUST RETURUN USAGI
TO HIS OWN WORLD.

06:34.303 --> 06:36.539
HE DOES NOT BELONG HERE.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.544
<i>BUT, SENSEI,
TUNING INTO HIS DIMENSION</i>

06:39.545 --> 06:41.213
WAS A ZILLION TO ONE FLUKE.

06:41.214 --> 06:43.817
I COULD NEVER FIND
ITS COORDINATES AGAIN.

06:43.818 --> 06:46.487
YOU MEAN
HE'S, LIKE,
STUCK HERE?

06:46.488 --> 06:49.325
I HAVE NO MASTER,
NO HOME.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.827
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.598
LET ME LEARN
OF YOUR STRANGE,
NEW WORLD.

06:53.599 --> 06:55.601
<i>DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO,
SENSEI?</i>

06:55.602 --> 06:59.406
TO TURN HIM AWAY
WOULD MEAN
HIS CERTAIN DEMISE.

06:59.407 --> 07:01.744
PUT HER THERE,
LITTLE ACE.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.679
PUT WHAT WHERE?

07:05.016 --> 07:07.352
HMM. MOST CURIOUS.

07:07.353 --> 07:09.855
WELCOME
TO THE GROUP, DUDE.

07:09.856 --> 07:12.793
USAGI'S GOING
TO NEED A DISGUISE.

07:15.031 --> 07:17.367
WELL, HOW DO I LOOK?

07:17.368 --> 07:20.605
LIKE A REGULAR
14th CENTURY
FASHION PLATE.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.178
MY, SUCH BIG CASTLES.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.614
SO, WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

07:26.615 --> 07:28.048
CHANNEL 6.

07:28.049 --> 07:31.454
YOU SAW HOW SHREDDER'S
SIGNAL INTERFERED
WITH MY PORTAL.

07:31.455 --> 07:33.457
WHEN HE USES THAT THING,

07:33.458 --> 07:36.461
ELECTRONICS PROBABLY
GO HAYWIRE ALL OVER TOWN.

07:36.462 --> 07:38.497
BUT WHY CHANNEL 6?

07:38.498 --> 07:39.966
WHEN THINGS GO CRAZY,

07:39.967 --> 07:43.039
WHO'S GONNA FIND OUT
FASTER THAN A NEWSROOM?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.673
HEY, YO, FRIAR TUCK,

07:44.674 --> 07:46.743
STEP RIGHT UP AND
WIN A KEWPIE DOLL.

07:46.744 --> 07:48.879
IT'LL REALLY
BRIGHTEN UP
THE MONASTERY.

07:55.959 --> 07:59.964
HERE, TAKE THEM ALL.
PLEASE.

07:59.965 --> 08:03.735
HELLO? HELLO?
WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON HERE?

08:03.736 --> 08:05.604
ALL MIDTOWN'S GONE CRAZY,

08:05.605 --> 08:07.440
AND NOW
THE PHONES ARE DEAD.

08:07.441 --> 08:09.777
APRIL,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

08:09.778 --> 08:11.280
I WAS TAPING IN MIDTOWN

08:11.281 --> 08:13.182
WHEN ALL OUR CAMERAS
BLEW UP.

08:13.183 --> 08:15.085
OH, GREAT.
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

08:15.086 --> 08:18.624
A BIG STORY IS BREAKING,
AND WE CAN'T EVEN
COVER IT.

08:18.625 --> 08:23.131
HI, FELLOWS.
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND
IN THE MONK'S OUTFIT?

08:23.132 --> 08:25.134
I AM A STRANGER
IN YOUR LAND.

08:25.135 --> 08:28.639
PLEASE ACCEPT THESE TOKENS
OF MY FRIENDSHIP.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.077
WHY, THANK YOU.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.948
I LOVE A MAN
WHO COMES BEARING GIFTS.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.785
AHH, YOU ARE
MOST WELCOME.

08:37.787 --> 08:41.791
OH, NO,
NOT ANOTHER MUTANT.

08:41.792 --> 08:44.295
FIRST SHELLS AND NOW FUR.

08:44.296 --> 08:46.699
WHEN DID SKIN
GO OUT OF FASHION?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.036
DID I HEAR
SOMEONE SAY MUTANT?

08:49.037 --> 08:50.905
HE'S NOT A MUTANT,
APRIL.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.674
HE'S FROM
ANOTHER DIMENSION.

08:52.675 --> 08:54.677
I AM MOST HONORED.

08:54.678 --> 08:57.214
MY NAME
IS USAGAI YOJIMBO.

08:57.215 --> 08:59.585
AND MY NAME IS MUD
IF I DON'T FIND OUT

08:59.586 --> 09:01.520
WHAT'S CAUSING
THIS POWER DISRUPTION.

09:01.521 --> 09:03.223
WE'RE CONVINCED IT'S
SHREDDER,

09:03.224 --> 09:05.861
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE SIGNAL'S COMING FROM?

09:05.862 --> 09:08.031
TRY MIDTOWN.
IT WORKED FOR ME.

09:08.032 --> 09:08.965
THANKS.

09:10.536 --> 09:13.038
THERE,
IT'S WORKING PERFECTLY.

09:13.039 --> 09:16.343
NOW, TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH DIMENSION X.

09:16.344 --> 09:18.480
LET'S HOPE
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

09:18.481 --> 09:20.482
FOR YOUR SAKE.

09:21.518 --> 09:22.786
I LIKE THAT WOMAN.

09:22.787 --> 09:26.257
HER EARS
WERE TOO SMALL
AND SHE LACKED FUR,

09:26.258 --> 09:28.026
BUT SHE WAS NICE.

09:28.027 --> 09:28.962
LOOK!

09:33.903 --> 09:36.940
THIS IS WHERE SHREDDER'S
TELEPORTATION
BEAM IS FOCUSED.

09:36.941 --> 09:39.010
MY THEORY WAS RIGHT.

09:39.011 --> 09:43.317
DONATELLO, THIS IS ONE TIME
I WISH YOU WERE WRONG.

09:50.594 --> 09:53.732
SCOPE IT OUT, DUDES.
FOOT SOLDIERS.

09:53.733 --> 09:56.502
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
SHREDDER'S DOING.

09:56.503 --> 09:58.606
ARE THOSE WARRIORS
YOUR ENEMIES?

09:58.607 --> 10:01.275
THAT'S THE
UNDERSTATEMENT
OF THE YEAR.

10:01.276 --> 10:04.948
THEN THEY ARE
MY ENEMIES, TOO. HUYYAH!

10:06.852 --> 10:10.790
ALLOW ME THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANNIHILATING YOU.

10:12.527 --> 10:14.830
UNCIVILIZED PEASANTS!

10:14.831 --> 10:17.033
I WILL TEACH YOU
SOME MANNERS.

10:23.877 --> 10:28.049
ALL RIGHT, BAG OF BOLTS,
TAKE THIS?

10:34.392 --> 10:37.730
HEY! SOMEONE
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

10:37.731 --> 10:41.235
ALL RIGHT, LET ME
AT THOSE TURKEYS!

10:41.236 --> 10:42.771
FORGET IT, MIKEY.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.075
OUR FRIEND USAGI'S
TAKEN CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.311
TERRIFIC.
NOW, I
CAN RETIRE

10:47.312 --> 10:48.646
AND START
WRITING
MY MEMOIRS.

10:50.050 --> 10:53.086
WHAT MANNER OF DEMONS
ARE THESE?

10:53.087 --> 10:55.089
THEY'RE NOT DEMONS,
DUDE.

10:55.090 --> 10:56.591
THEY'RE ROBOTS.

10:56.592 --> 10:58.427
THEY'RE MACHINES
MADE OF METAL,

10:58.428 --> 11:00.730
BUT DESIGNED
TO LOOK LIKE MEN.

11:00.731 --> 11:03.435
THIS IS POWERFUL
SORCERY, INDEED.

11:03.436 --> 11:07.808
IF WE TOOK ONE
OF THESE POWERPACKS
BACK TO THE LAIR,

11:07.809 --> 11:09.643
I COULD HOME IN ON
ITS FREQUENCY.

11:12.282 --> 11:13.951
ANOTHER EVIL ROBOT.

11:15.453 --> 11:17.991
SHREDDER MUST BE BRINGING
THOSE FOOT SOLDIERS

11:17.992 --> 11:19.125
OVER FOR SOMETHING.

11:19.126 --> 11:22.029
WE CAN KEEP TABS ON THEM
WITH THIS POWERPACK

11:22.030 --> 11:23.131
AND FIND OUT
WHAT HE'S UP TO.

11:23.132 --> 11:26.803
THEN LET'S GET BACK
TO THE SEWERS. USAGI?

11:26.804 --> 11:28.138
HE'S GONE.

11:28.139 --> 11:29.474
SWELL.

11:29.475 --> 11:32.479
<i>WE'VE GOT A RUNAWAY
SAMURAI BUNNY ON OUR HANDS.</i>

11:32.480 --> 11:34.347
DONATELLO,
YOU GET BACK,

11:34.348 --> 11:35.483
AND GET TO WORK
ON YOUR PLAN.

11:35.484 --> 11:38.721
THE REST OF US WILL
HAVE TO FIND HIM.

11:39.789 --> 11:43.161
WHAT? ALL THE FOOT
SOLDIERS DESTROYED?

11:43.162 --> 11:46.032
THOSE BLASTED
TURTLES AGAIN.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.402
ONE DAY, I'M GOING
TO SEND THEM A BILL

11:48.403 --> 11:50.471
FOR ALL THOSE ROBOT PARTS.

11:50.472 --> 11:54.577
BUT EVEN THEY CAN'T STOP
ME FROM FLOODING THE CITY
WITH FOOT SOLDIERS!

12:07.530 --> 12:09.801
<i>BONSOIR. AND HOW MANY
FOR DINNER, MONSIEUR?</i>

12:09.802 --> 12:12.938
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE.

12:12.939 --> 12:15.108
I'M AFRAID YOU WILL
NEED A RESERVATION.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.519
PERHAPS,
IN YOUR CASE,

12:22.520 --> 12:25.456
<i>I CAN MAKE
 UN PETIT
EXCEPTION.</i>

12:30.699 --> 12:33.001
COWARDLY ROBOT!

12:33.002 --> 12:34.938
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN!

12:37.175 --> 12:40.846
AHH, MY KIND OF PLACE.

12:46.322 --> 12:48.858
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
YOU'RE AN HOUR LATE.

12:48.859 --> 12:50.894
NOW, HOP TO IT.

12:52.431 --> 12:54.266
BROTHERS!

12:54.267 --> 12:57.938
THERE. NOW, TO FIND OUT WHAT
THE FOOT SOLDIERS ARE UP TO.

12:57.939 --> 13:00.442
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
HAVING A CONVENTION.

13:00.443 --> 13:04.214
THEY ARE CONVERGING ON THE
FAR EASTERN ANIMAL MUSEUM

13:04.215 --> 13:05.783
IN LITTLE TOKYO TOWN.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.220
WHAT COULD SHREDDER
POSSIBLY WANT THERE?

13:08.221 --> 13:11.926
IT HOUSES A COLLECTION
OF MYSTICAL ORIENTAL RELICS,

13:11.927 --> 13:13.560
ALL RELATING
TO ANIMALS.

13:13.561 --> 13:16.299
MY OLD FRIEND OBANTO
IS GUARDIAN.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.535
AND WHATEVER
SHREDDER IS AFTER,

13:18.536 --> 13:20.238
IT CAN ONLY LEAD TO EVIL.

13:20.239 --> 13:23.575
WE MUST FIND THE OTHERS
AND HASTEN THERE.

13:24.879 --> 13:27.081
HERE, MY LITTLE ONES.

13:27.082 --> 13:29.818
NOW, NOW. THERE IS PLENTY
FOR ALL OF YOU.

13:29.819 --> 13:31.821
DO NOT WORRY, BABY-SAN.

13:31.822 --> 13:34.158
YOU ARE SAFE AS LONG
AS YOU ARE HERE.

13:35.527 --> 13:37.830
ARF ARF!
MEOW!

13:37.831 --> 13:40.367
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:42.171 --> 13:44.106
NO, NOT BABY-SAN.

13:44.107 --> 13:45.375
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

13:47.079 --> 13:50.582
UH, 2 CARROT SOUFFLES,
HOLD THE MAYO.

13:50.583 --> 13:54.188
GREETINGS, BROTHER.
A QUESTION, PLEASE.

13:54.189 --> 13:56.524
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY
OF US RABBITS HERE?

13:56.525 --> 14:00.297
QUIT GOOFING OFF,
YOU TWO, AND
GET BACK TO WORK.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.600
YEAH, WE SLAVE ALL DAY

14:02.601 --> 14:04.804
WHILE THAT CREEP
JUST BOSSES US AROUND.

14:04.805 --> 14:07.007
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

14:07.008 --> 14:09.845
ALL MY BROTHER
CREATURES, SLAVES.

14:09.846 --> 14:11.681
I MUST LIBERATE THEM.

14:11.682 --> 14:14.685
HEY, YOU!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE--

14:14.686 --> 14:17.289
YOU WILL SEE
THAT WE RABBITS

14:17.290 --> 14:19.926
ARE NOT TO BE
TRIFLED WITH.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.368
JOIN IN, BROTHERS!

14:25.369 --> 14:27.304
FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM!

14:33.881 --> 14:35.883
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:35.884 --> 14:37.286
LEAVE BABY-SAN ALONE.

14:40.056 --> 14:41.858
NO, YOU MUSTN'T!

14:46.599 --> 14:48.101
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO MEET YOU.

14:48.102 --> 14:50.071
HAVE YOU FOUND USAGI?

14:50.072 --> 14:51.573
NOT A TRACE OF HIM.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.544
CANCEL THAT.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.247
I'LL GET HIM.

14:56.248 --> 14:58.716
EXCUSE ME. LOOK OUT.
PARDON ME.

14:58.717 --> 14:59.852
OUT OF MY WAY.

14:59.853 --> 15:03.624
NOW YOU KNOW
NOT TO ENSLAVE
INNOCENT RABBITS.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.461
I'VE HAD JUST
ABOUT ENOUGH
OF THIS.

15:05.462 --> 15:08.665
HEY, DUDE, LIKE,
DON'T BE SO HOSTILE.

15:08.666 --> 15:11.202
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:11.203 --> 15:13.973
I'M RESCUING
MY FURRY LITTLE BUD.

15:13.974 --> 15:16.877
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN MY TURTLE
SOUP RESTAURANT

15:16.878 --> 15:17.913
DOWN THE STREET.

15:17.914 --> 15:20.716
NOW, GET BACK THERE
AND GET TO WORK.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.025
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.762
DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

15:28.763 --> 15:30.231
NO, LITTLE DUDE.

15:30.232 --> 15:32.834
YOU DID EVERYTHING
JUST RIGHT.

15:32.835 --> 15:35.972
THE FOOT SOLDIERS HAVE
LEFT LITTLE TOKYO TOWN.

15:35.973 --> 15:38.610
THEY'VE GONE
TO THE MIDTOWN
POWER PLANT.

15:38.611 --> 15:41.013
THEN THAT'S
WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

15:43.117 --> 15:45.119
THIS IS THE PLACE.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.390
WHY ARE THEY GUARDING
A SMOKESTACK?

15:48.391 --> 15:50.427
HERE COMES THE ANSWER.

15:57.138 --> 15:59.974
I'M SORRY I ASKED.

16:06.785 --> 16:07.819
TIME TO BOOGIE, DUDES,

16:07.820 --> 16:09.756
AND I'M TALKING WARP SPEED.

16:09.757 --> 16:12.793
QUICK! HEAD FOR
THE TURTLE VAN!

16:12.794 --> 16:16.298
WE MUST FIND OBANTO,
THE ANIMAL SHELTER GUARDIAN.

16:16.299 --> 16:19.236
HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN CONTROL THAT BEAST.

16:19.237 --> 16:22.041
THOSE ARE THE ONLY
OTHER FOOT SOLDIERS
IN THE CITY.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.543
THEY MUST HAVE HIM.

16:23.544 --> 16:25.045
DONATELLO, YOU DRIVE.

16:25.046 --> 16:27.115
USAGI, YOU WILL
ACCOMPANY US.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.086
THE REST OF YOU,
TRY TO KEEP
THE DRAGON AT BAY.

16:30.087 --> 16:31.721
LET'S GO, FELLOWS.

16:31.722 --> 16:34.091
HOW COME WE GET
ALL THE FUN JOBS?

16:36.397 --> 16:37.897
WHAT A BUMMER.

16:37.898 --> 16:40.969
BABYSITTER
TO A GIANT DRAGON.

16:43.974 --> 16:46.343
LOOKS TO ME
LIKE HE'S HUNGRY.

16:46.344 --> 16:49.214
CHECK IT OUT, DUDES.
GRAIN ELEVATORS.

16:52.653 --> 16:53.955
HOPE HE LIKES BRAN.

16:58.028 --> 17:01.266
ONE GRAIN ELEVATOR
GOING DOWN!

17:09.011 --> 17:11.012
MICHELANGELO,
I HAVE TO ADMIT IT,

17:11.013 --> 17:13.784
THAT WAS
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

17:13.785 --> 17:15.551
<i>THANKS, AMIGO.</i>

17:15.553 --> 17:18.124
UH-OH,
IT'S GETTING BIGGER.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.426
YOU AND YOUR DUMB IDEAS.

17:20.428 --> 17:23.098
THIS IS WHERE
THOSE 4 FOOT SOLDIERS WENT.

17:23.098 --> 17:25.867
"ECOLOGICAL WASTE
TREATMENT CENTER."

17:25.868 --> 17:27.871
THAT'S ECOLOGICAL?

17:27.872 --> 17:29.874
SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO REPORT THESE JERKS.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.043
LOOK!

17:31.044 --> 17:33.713
HELP! PLEASE, HELP ME!

17:33.714 --> 17:35.049
THEY HAVE OBANTO.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.384
COME!

17:53.010 --> 17:56.246
YOU ARE ONE OF
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES,

17:56.247 --> 17:57.716
BUT WHO IS THIS?

17:57.717 --> 18:00.720
THERE IS NO TIME
TO EXPLAIN, OBANTO-SAN.

18:00.721 --> 18:02.890
THAT DRAGON EGG
OF YOURS HAS HATCHED.

18:02.891 --> 18:04.993
BABY-SAN IS LOOSE?

18:04.994 --> 18:06.228
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

18:06.229 --> 18:08.298
CAN YOU DO ANYTHING
TO STOP HIM?

18:08.299 --> 18:09.801
THERE IS
A SLIGHT CHANCE,

18:09.802 --> 18:11.737
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING
I WILL NEED

18:11.738 --> 18:13.038
FROM THE ANIMAL
SHELTER.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.610
YO, DRAGON DUDE,
THIS WAY!

18:16.611 --> 18:19.080
GOOD DRAGON.

18:19.081 --> 18:20.816
I HOPE THIS NEW PLAN
OF YOURS

18:20.817 --> 18:22.252
WORKS BETTER
THAN THE OLD ONE.

18:22.253 --> 18:24.422
HEY, IT CAN'T
FAIL, DUDES.

18:24.423 --> 18:26.692
EXCEPT YOU FORGOT
ONE THING.

18:26.693 --> 18:28.228
THE FOOT DUDES!

18:28.229 --> 18:30.030
I'LL TRY
AND HOLD THEM OFF.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.966
TAKE TURTLE STEEL!

18:31.967 --> 18:35.972
BOY, I WISH I
COULD GET TO SAY
LINES LIKE THAT.

18:37.642 --> 18:39.410
HEY, BIG BUD!

18:39.411 --> 18:40.880
OVER HERE!

18:53.767 --> 18:57.104
ANOTHER GREAT
MICHELANGELO IDEA.

18:57.105 --> 19:01.243
HEY, EVEN GREAT MINDS
GOOF UP ONCE IN A WHILE.

19:04.682 --> 19:06.550
WHOA! LOOK OUT!

19:09.457 --> 19:14.463
MAN, IT'S GOING
TO BE A HOT TIME
IN THE OLD TOWN TONIGHT.

19:14.464 --> 19:17.868
AH, I HAVE FOUND IT,
THE BLUE FLAME OF OSAKA.

19:17.869 --> 19:21.206
THE ONLY THING THAT
CAN SAVE THE DRAGON
FROM THE CITY.

19:21.207 --> 19:23.811
DON'T YOU MEAN
SAVE THE CITY
FROM THE DRAGON?

19:23.812 --> 19:26.047
I KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:27.115 --> 19:30.119
<i>ALL UNITS,
INTO THE POWER PLANT,</i>

19:30.120 --> 19:32.122
<i>AND SHOOT TO KILL.</i>

19:32.123 --> 19:35.728
SEE? THEY'RE OUT
TO DESTROY HIM.
WE MUST HURRY!

19:40.603 --> 19:42.605
HIT US
WITH YOUR BEST SHOT!

19:48.447 --> 19:50.617
<i>VEHICLES, HALT!</i>

19:50.618 --> 19:53.988
BABY-SAN! THEY'RE GOING
TO SLAUGHTER HIM.

19:53.989 --> 19:55.223
THIS IS BAD?

19:55.224 --> 19:57.727
YOU ARE A FELLOW REPTILE.

19:57.728 --> 20:00.731
SURELY YOU MUST
KNOW HOW HUMANS
MISUNDERSTAND YOU,

20:00.732 --> 20:03.068
BUT THE BLUE FLAME
CAN SAVE HIM.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.273
WHO AMONG YOU IS
WILLING TO PLACE THIS
IN THE DRAGON'S MOUTH?

20:06.274 --> 20:09.645
OHH...
OHH...
UM...
I'M LATE...

20:09.646 --> 20:13.917
<i>ALLOW THIS HUMBLE RONIN
TO TRY, OBANTO-SAN.</i>

20:13.918 --> 20:15.487
AS YOU WISH.

20:15.488 --> 20:16.855
READY...

20:16.856 --> 20:18.458
AIM...

20:30.343 --> 20:32.045
FIRE!

20:35.750 --> 20:37.986
UH, NEVER MIND.

20:39.056 --> 20:42.092
WELL, WHAT WENT WRONG
THIS TIME?

20:42.093 --> 20:43.762
I DON'T KNOW.

20:43.763 --> 20:46.098
THE CITY SHOULD
BE RUBBLE BY NOW.

20:46.099 --> 20:48.936
I'LL CHECK
THE INSTANT REPLAY.

20:48.937 --> 20:50.371
WHO IS THAT?

20:50.372 --> 20:53.777
ANOTHER
MUTANT MAGGOT.

20:53.778 --> 20:55.580
WHOEVER HE IS,

20:55.581 --> 20:57.816
<i>HE IS A SUPERB
SAMURAI
WARRIOR.</i>

20:57.817 --> 21:00.320
THAT'S IT,
BLAME YOUR DEFEAT

21:00.321 --> 21:04.592
ON A CUTE, FURRY
LITTLE BUNNY. HA HA!

21:04.593 --> 21:06.762
LAUGH IF YOU
WANT TO, KRANG,

21:06.763 --> 21:10.634
BUT ONE DAY,
I'LL HAVE
MY RABBIT REVENGE.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.074
BABY-SAN WILL GIVE YOU
NO MORE TROUBLE,

21:14.075 --> 21:15.809
NOR WILL ANYONE
TROUBLE HIM.

21:15.810 --> 21:17.646
NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEANT

21:17.647 --> 21:19.348
ABOUT SAVING HIM
FROM THE CITY.

21:19.349 --> 21:21.652
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR YOUR EFFORTS,

21:21.653 --> 21:24.755
THIS MAGICAL CREATURE
WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

21:24.756 --> 21:27.827
OBANTO-SAN, THERE IS
ANOTHER CREATURE

21:27.828 --> 21:29.196
WHO NEEDS
YOUR PROTECTION,

21:29.197 --> 21:31.766
A STRANGER
FROM A DISTANT LAND,

21:31.767 --> 21:33.536
STRANDED
IN OUR WORLD.

21:33.537 --> 21:36.440
I WILL GLADLY
CARE FOR HIM
AND KEEP HIM SAFE

21:36.441 --> 21:40.346
UNTIL YOU CAN FIND
A WAY OF RETURNING
HIM TO HIS OWN WORLD.

21:40.347 --> 21:43.250
LOOKS LIKE NO TV
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

21:43.251 --> 21:45.853
TRY THE NEXT 20 YEARS.
