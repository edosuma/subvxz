Oh. Ooh!

Before we talk about
investment opportunities,
Ms. Amara,

02:07.250 --> 02:10.920
I've been meaning to ask
about your progress
curing my dear friend,

02:10.920 --> 02:12.170
Orso Knox.

02:12.170 --> 02:14.380
Oh. Orso Knox.
Of course.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.330
I'm confident we're
two to three weeks
from a breakthrough.

02:17.330 --> 02:19.210
Well, that's a relief
to hear.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.540
Oh, Liv! Have you seen
the sleepy hedgehog?

02:21.540 --> 02:23.080
Have I?
(laughs)

02:23.080 --> 02:26.080
I made it into a meme
on Sycorax's "life-smile"
blog.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.880
Uh, what Liv just said.
Does that sound
familiar to you guys?

02:31.880 --> 02:34.670
Baymax:
Yes. I am often told
that I am cute.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.830
I am not programmed
to know what that means.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.330
No, I mean...
here.

02:38.330 --> 02:41.210
Random aside, Liv.
How is that
mutated fellow?

02:41.210 --> 02:44.250
So horribly mutated.
What is his... ?
Orso Knox.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.120
I'm confident we're
two to three weeks
from a breakthrough.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.330
See? It's the exact
same answer.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.040
And this was
two months ago.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.500
Something's not right.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.830
Whoop!

03:00.830 --> 03:02.790
Baymax:
These microbes
are dangerous.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.960
Which is why
there's a sign!

03:04.960 --> 03:06.210
(klaxon blares)

03:06.210 --> 03:08.620
Baymax:
It is advisable
to be cautious

03:08.620 --> 03:10.620
when working with
hazardous organisms.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.290
The point is
to make them
less hazardous

03:13.290 --> 03:15.040
with modified
viral vectors

03:15.040 --> 03:16.830
that reprogram DNA.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.710
Oh, the old vector
method, eh?

03:18.710 --> 03:20.000
You don't know
what that is.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.210
Well, I know it
involves vectors,
and...

03:23.210 --> 03:24.920
And a method.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.290
-What do you idiots want?
-We're just checking up
on Orso Knox.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.710
So, any progress?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.330
And why is that
your business?

03:31.330 --> 03:34.380
(sighs) You were right, Fred.
Karmi doesn't know anything.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.460
What? I never said...

03:35.460 --> 03:38.120
I mean, why would Liv
tell an intern

03:38.120 --> 03:39.420
anything important?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.620
Liv and I are BFFs.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.460
If I wanted to,
I could find out

03:43.460 --> 03:46.000
all about your
monster friend
by lunch tomorrow.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Great! I'll put it
in my calendar.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.790

04:12.830 --> 04:14.210
Ugh.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.250
What the... ?

04:24.250 --> 04:25.290
What?

04:26.670 --> 04:30.000
Ambitious and adorable
intern Karmi to see you.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.380
Of course.
Send her in.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.420
Karmi. How are you?
Can I get you
anything?

04:35.420 --> 04:38.080
Sustainable water?
Pseudo juice?
Air brewed tea?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.880
-Oh, no. That's--
-Chris, bring Karmi
some tea.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.210
He makes the best
air brew.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.500
I'm sorry to bother you, Liv.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.170
I know you're super busy.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.250
Are you kidding?
My door's always open
for you.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.880
Literally. The door recognizes
your bio-signature,

04:49.880 --> 04:52.290
and whoosh! Open.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.330
Okay. We're connected,
and our body language
is empathy-positive.

04:55.330 --> 04:59.380
-Talk to me.
-Well... I kinda happened to
run across the Orso Knox file,

04:59.380 --> 05:02.330
and for some reason,
I can't open it.

05:02.330 --> 05:05.500
Well, that's because
the Knox project is for
my Knox team.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.170
And only my Knox team.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.620
But I think
I could help.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.420
I've been working with
viral vectors to re--

05:10.420 --> 05:12.290
I cherish your
enthusiasm, Karmi.

05:12.290 --> 05:15.040
It's exactly the kind
of kick this company needs
to drive change,

05:15.040 --> 05:17.710
but I need you
and your kicky
enthusiasm

05:17.710 --> 05:20.040
to just keep doing
exactly what you've
been doing.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.880
Oh.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.830
Cupcake?

05:24.250 --> 05:25.670
(elevator dings)

05:29.290 --> 05:31.040
What are you losers
doing here?

05:31.040 --> 05:33.880
Well, you were taking
too long, so we thought
we'd come see Liv.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.250
You can't just
"see" Liv.
She's busy.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.500
Baymax:
Liv Amara is
right there.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.500
(gasps)

05:47.830 --> 05:50.080
What are you trying
to do to me, Hiro?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.830
And whatever your name is,
no eating in my lab!

05:51.830 --> 05:53.830
Oh, but it's
lunchtime!

05:53.830 --> 05:55.960
Yaki taco?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.670
So, did Liv let you
see anything on Knox,
or not?

05:58.670 --> 06:02.290
As if a bio amateur like you
would understand, anyway.

06:02.290 --> 06:05.170
Baymax:
Please allow me to help.
I have a complete library of--

06:05.170 --> 06:07.500
She's bluffing,
Baymax.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.080
-Karmi: What are you doing?
-Checking out the Knox file.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.750
Karmi:
Oh, yeah?
Well, it's locked.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.420
Good luck
accessing it.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.120
Encrypted file?
I don't need luck.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.500
Ha! Who's the amateur now?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.620
You can't just...
ugh!

06:18.620 --> 06:21.420
Hiro:
Looks like they're keeping him
in a high-security lab in...

06:21.420 --> 06:23.580
Wow. Sub-level nine.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.420
Fred: That's the most
mysterious sub-level
there is.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.540
Unless there's a
sub-level ten.
Is there sub-level ten?

06:28.540 --> 06:30.080
Wait, stop.
Go back.

06:31.380 --> 06:34.620
Baymax: It would appear
that Orso Knox
is experiencing

06:34.620 --> 06:38.080
Baymax, Karmi: An over-
expression of various mutated
gene sequences.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.420
Baymax:
Correct.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.290
Karmi: Except the patterns
in these base pairs
aren't similar at all.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.750
Baymax:
Perhaps it is
being caused by...

06:43.750 --> 06:45.620
a specific
regulatory region.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.040
Yes! Somewhere
upstream.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.580
Maybe someone else
jump in now.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.210
So, what I'm hearing is
you can fix him!

06:53.210 --> 06:54.710
Well, yeah.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.540
But I am not risking
my internship.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.330
Karmi, please.
Someone has to help.

06:59.330 --> 07:02.420
Ugh. Fine.
But how do we
even get down there?

07:02.420 --> 07:03.920
I don't have access.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.500
That's not gonna
be a problem.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.790
See? Not a problem.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.750
(beeping)

07:14.040 --> 07:15.920
(heartbeat thudding)

07:17.540 --> 07:18.830

07:50.420 --> 07:51.880
Fascinating.

07:54.330 --> 07:57.380
Excuse me, Mr. Knox.
It's me. Fred.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.920
Of the San Fransokyo
Fredericksons.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.080
Wait. Couldn't he
talk before?

08:05.080 --> 08:07.790
Liv: The longer
he spends like this,
the less human he gets.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.380
-He's been sub-verbal
for weeks now.
-(low growling)

08:10.380 --> 08:12.080
Now, a question
for all of you.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.330
-What are you doing down here?
-Karmi: Uh, I can explain.

08:14.330 --> 08:18.080
Karmi, I thought
you were a value adder,
not a rule breaker.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.120
This is my
disappointed face.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.040
It's not Karmi's fault.
I-I made her--

08:22.040 --> 08:23.460
Hi. I'm talking
to Karmi.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.500
-I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to--
-(computer beeps)

08:29.000 --> 08:31.290
You did all this?
Just now?

08:31.290 --> 08:34.710
(sighs)
Yes. And I'm so sorry.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.710
This is...
impressive.

08:37.710 --> 08:38.920
Both:
It is?

08:38.920 --> 08:40.790
I have a meeting, so let's
close the loop on this.

08:40.790 --> 08:42.880
Karmi, keep working,
with permission this time.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.330
Wait. I'm not fired?

08:44.330 --> 08:47.250
(laughs) I can overlook
the breaking of a rule
now and then.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.380
I'm the boss.
Mr. Frederickson,
walk with me.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.420
-Uh... sure?
-I trust you can
show yourself out.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.540
Yep. I can do that.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.330
Liv: Great.
How's your mother?

08:58.330 --> 08:59.960
I haven't had a chance
to follow up with her

08:59.960 --> 09:01.540
after our investment
discussion.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.500
So, what's next?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.120
What's next is you leaving.

-(growling)

09:14.120 --> 09:16.500

09:16.500 --> 09:18.170
Oh, no.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.960
Do not, "Oh, no."

09:19.960 --> 09:22.290
I don't want to hear
any "Oh, no'ing"
from you.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.380
Uh, Karmi?

09:26.830 --> 09:28.620
Karmi:
Oh, no.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.580
-(footsteps)
-Uh...

09:32.580 --> 09:34.750
Baymax.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.170

10:15.920 --> 10:18.790
The whole building became
a super-villain-style deathtrap!

10:18.790 --> 10:22.210
I mean a super cool,
super-villain-style deathtrap,
but still...

10:22.210 --> 10:25.040
-a deathtrap, nonetheless.
-It's our auto lock down.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.380
Ooh. A containment
breach in sub-level nine,
which means...

10:28.380 --> 10:32.170
-Knox. He's out.
-B-b-but, my friends.
They're still down there.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.620
Even I don't have
the authority to override
lock down protocol.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.380
Excuse me. I need
to gather my team.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.710
Me, too.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.380
I have fallen.
And I cannot
get up.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.290
Thank you.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.620
-Hiro: This way!
-Karmi: Over here.

10:54.290 --> 10:56.620
(growling)

11:06.170 --> 11:08.170
(relieved sighs)

11:08.170 --> 11:09.880
What are you doing?

11:09.880 --> 11:12.210
-I can override a
containment protocol.
-You can't!

11:12.210 --> 11:14.540
-Thanks for the vote
of confidence.
-No, I mean...

11:14.540 --> 11:16.380
The protocol is there
for a reason.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.120
If Knox got out,
it'd be bad.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.210
Karmi is correct.
Mr. Knox has a bite--

11:21.210 --> 11:23.120
-Both:
One-hundred times--
-Hiro: that of a human.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.750
Right. Because, monster!

11:24.750 --> 11:26.710
Look, that monster
used to be a person.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.330
So the only way out of this
is to turn him back into one.

11:29.330 --> 11:31.330
No offense, Karmi, but
I don't think we have time

11:31.330 --> 11:33.960
for you to show off your
"mad bio skills."

11:33.960 --> 11:35.920
Just because you say
"no offense,"

11:35.920 --> 11:38.000
doesn't mean you weren't
way offensive, you know.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.790
Look, if we trap him
in his cell, then we're
good to go, right?

11:40.790 --> 11:42.920
You want us to go back
out there without a cure?

11:42.920 --> 11:45.380
Baymax and I will.
You stay put.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.380
Ugh.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.580
As if I'd just sit here
and wait.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.790
(tapping)

11:54.790 --> 11:57.080
Honey Lemon,
can you dissolve
the walls?

11:57.080 --> 12:00.210
Sorry, Freddie. Titanium is
pretty unreactive,
so it's hard to melt.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.250
Okay. Then let's
blast through.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.540
-I'll kick through.
-Go Go: Nah, not so much.

12:07.540 --> 12:10.210
We can't beat the tensile
strength of this alloy.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.790
Well, not with that
attitude, we can't.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.580
I could try cutting it,
but...

12:13.580 --> 12:15.830
Is it okay that we just
break in?

12:15.830 --> 12:18.460
-If you can, please do.
-Hey, Chri--

12:18.460 --> 12:20.580
I mean, guy I've
never met before.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.920
May your blade
be as true
as your heart.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.330
Man. That guys is
good lookin'.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.380
-His face is very symmetrical.
-So symmetrical.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.290
Meh.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.500
Can we please focus?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.290
Ah, we just need something
to get him back into his cell.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.580
Ah. Guess he's
a big eater.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.380
Baymax:
My scan indicates
that there is food

12:53.380 --> 12:55.120
in that refrigerator.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.170
Okay. Let's...
do this.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.540
Ugh. He actually
eats this stuff?

13:01.540 --> 13:03.330
(squishing, glopping)

13:03.330 --> 13:05.290
Baymax:
It contains beef rump,

13:05.290 --> 13:07.880
and beef rump by-products.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.210
(growling)

13:10.210 --> 13:11.830
Hiro:
Baymax.

13:15.790 --> 13:19.330
(growling)

13:19.330 --> 13:20.880
(sniffing)

13:34.420 --> 13:36.330
Aw, come on.

13:37.830 --> 13:40.250
Come on.
Come on.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.540
(chomping)

13:46.540 --> 13:48.000
(squishing)

13:50.380 --> 13:52.000
(growling)

13:52.000 --> 13:53.750
(gasping)

13:53.750 --> 13:56.620
Hey, monster--
uh, Mr. Knox.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.880
-(roaring)
-(Hiro yelling)

13:58.880 --> 14:00.420
Baymax:
Hiro, I will protect you.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.040
(roars)

14:04.170 --> 14:05.420
-(electricity crackles)
-Baymax: Sorry.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.420
Baymax!

14:09.380 --> 14:11.080
So... now what?

14:13.290 --> 14:15.380
Almost there.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.170
(panting)

14:20.250 --> 14:21.460
(crashing)

14:25.880 --> 14:27.080
Hiro: Ah!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.880
Mr. Knox could seriously
injure bystanders.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.710
It's time to make
some hard decisions.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.830
Is she saying what
I think she's saying?

14:40.830 --> 14:44.000
But, Knox is human.
On the inside.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.830
Yeah. He's one of my...

14:45.830 --> 14:49.540
The Frederickson family's
friends.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.080
Whoa, that is not
easy to say, huh?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
-We've tried to cure him.
-But I haven't.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.920
If I modify the viral proteins
from my work at SFIT and
run some tests...

14:57.920 --> 14:59.380
Karmi, we're out
of time.

15:00.580 --> 15:04.290
Big Hero 6. Please do
whatever it takes
to save the boy.

15:04.290 --> 15:07.330
We are gonna need
the ultra armor.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.290
Tough choices.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.920
Iced tea?

15:22.120 --> 15:23.750
-(Knox grunting)
-(Hiro grunting)

15:25.960 --> 15:27.000
(Hiro yelping)

15:29.330 --> 15:31.330
Hiro:
Bad idea.
Bad idea!

15:31.330 --> 15:32.920
(yelling)

15:34.250 --> 15:35.040
(Hiro grunts)

15:39.670 --> 15:41.540
You... saved me?

15:44.250 --> 15:45.920
Why did you save me?

15:48.250 --> 15:50.380
You weren't trying
to hurt me.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.380
(clanking, clattering)

15:56.380 --> 15:58.210
You weren't trying
to hurt anyone.

16:02.210 --> 16:04.380
You're just a...
really big eater.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.830
(cat meows)

16:10.790 --> 16:12.210
Hey, hey. Calm down.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.250
(truck horn blares)

16:16.250 --> 16:18.500
Wait! Hey!
We-- we can help you.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.040
-(tires screech)
-(cars honk)

16:25.380 --> 16:26.500
-(Hiro gasps)
-(heavy thud)

16:29.420 --> 16:30.420
Oh, boy.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.210
Baymax, do you
see anything?

16:35.210 --> 16:37.210
My scanning capabilities
are damaged.

16:37.210 --> 16:41.210
However, I am able
to detect a sizable
heat signature

16:41.210 --> 16:42.330
in the subway tunnels.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.460
-Knox?
-That is most probable.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.250
Then I guess we're going
underground.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.080
I don't know if I'm
mentally prepared
for that.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.290
-Get there.
-Fred: Heroes save Hiro is a go.

16:51.290 --> 16:53.710
Hmm. Does that sound
confusing?

16:53.710 --> 16:56.790
Uh, Mr. Knox?
Where are you?

16:56.790 --> 16:59.210
Look, this is a big
misunderstanding.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.880
(distant roaring)

17:00.880 --> 17:02.120
Great.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.580
(sniffing)

17:06.540 --> 17:10.830
Guys, in a horror movie,
this is when the bad
things happen.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.960
Ooh, check it out.
Either Knox or a dinosaur,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.120
but if we're going to be
realistic, probably Knox.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.750
(roaring)

17:17.750 --> 17:19.830
Okay. Definitely
Knox.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.880
Baymax, can you still
fight like that?

17:21.880 --> 17:23.620
Baymax:
I will do my best.
For Hiro.

17:23.620 --> 17:24.960
This way.

17:32.290 --> 17:33.920
(low growling)

17:33.920 --> 17:35.080
Fred:
There!

17:40.290 --> 17:41.420
(roaring)

17:43.710 --> 17:44.960
Hiro's not here!

17:44.960 --> 17:46.420
What did you do
with Hiro?

17:51.710 --> 17:52.620
(Go Go grunts)

17:53.620 --> 17:55.330
Fred:
You're going down!

17:55.330 --> 17:56.710
Okay, I'm going down.

17:56.710 --> 17:57.710
-Freddie!
-(crashing)

17:59.500 --> 18:01.670
Mr. Knox.
Where are you?

18:02.960 --> 18:04.080
(distant rumbling)

18:05.920 --> 18:06.830
Oh, no.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.330
Honey Lemon!

18:14.750 --> 18:15.540
(grunts)

18:17.080 --> 18:18.670
Baymax! Rocket Fist.

18:18.670 --> 18:19.830
(energy charging)

18:22.500 --> 18:24.960
-(thudding)
-(roaring)

18:26.500 --> 18:27.290
(grunts)

18:28.420 --> 18:30.250
No, no, no, no, no.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.750
(crashing)

18:34.290 --> 18:35.580
Hiro:
Stop!

18:36.710 --> 18:41.290
-Everyone, just stop.
-You're okay. I thought
you were...

18:41.290 --> 18:44.790
-Not okay!
-Everyone needs to calm down.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.750
It's all right.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.920
Everything's...
all right.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.500
Hiro, your position is
un-advisable.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.830
Don't worry, Baymax.
Knox wasn't trying
to hurt me.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.500
He wasn't trying
to hurt anyone.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.210
But didn't he take you
prisoner?

18:59.210 --> 19:01.290
Oh. Was this not
a horror movie?

19:01.290 --> 19:03.330
Was it a buddy movie
all along?

19:03.330 --> 19:05.880
-(growling)
-Horror buddy?

19:05.880 --> 19:09.420
Just try not to make
any sudden movements,

19:09.420 --> 19:10.500
or loud noises.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.080
(whimpering)

19:19.080 --> 19:20.540
Oh, no.

19:20.540 --> 19:23.080
So... much... dust!

19:23.080 --> 19:25.040
(yelling):
Ah-choo!

19:25.040 --> 19:26.250
(roaring)

19:26.250 --> 19:28.420
-(thudding)
-(cracking)

19:32.500 --> 19:33.290
(Hiro screams)

19:34.620 --> 19:35.420
Hiro!

19:42.460 --> 19:44.000
He saved you.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.380
Now...
it's our turn
to save him.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.290
(gasps)

19:55.290 --> 19:57.210
Captain Cutie!

19:57.210 --> 19:58.250
(giggling)

19:58.250 --> 20:00.830
(deep voice):
Yup, that's me.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.960
Captain Cutie.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.170
I promise you,
we'll cure Mr. Knox.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.330
Karmi, I know you will.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.670
Wait. What about Hiro?

20:10.670 --> 20:12.920
Was he... hurt?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.620
Ah... uh...

20:14.620 --> 20:16.710
Your friend Hiro
is fine.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.420
He's not my friend.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.540
I barely know him, really.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.540
Right. Let's go.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.960
So, Karmi,
did your serum work?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.290
Yes, but it's not
my serum.

20:31.290 --> 20:34.920
At Sycorax,
we don't like words
like "my" or "me."

20:34.920 --> 20:37.290
The breakthrough
was a team effort,

20:37.290 --> 20:40.460
based almost
completely
on my work.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.330
Well, I guess Mr. Knox
really owes one to the
Sycorax team.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.750
Mr. Knox has
graciously agreed

20:50.750 --> 20:52.920
to invest in
Sycorax's future.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.290
Generously.

20:54.290 --> 20:56.000
Thank you.
Uh...

20:56.000 --> 21:00.420
The work Liv and Sycorax
are doing is truly...

21:00.420 --> 21:02.920
life changing.
(chuckles)

21:02.920 --> 21:05.960
-They cured me, after all.
-(audience clapping)

21:05.960 --> 21:07.330
Yes, they did.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.750
(camera shudders
clicking)

21:09.750 --> 21:11.880
Liv:
You did so well,
Orso.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.830
Honestly, I have
zero complaints.

21:13.830 --> 21:16.420
Look, can I go?
I've paid you,
haven't I?

21:16.420 --> 21:18.380
Not paid.
Invested.

21:19.420 --> 21:22.210
In me, yes.
But also in you.

21:22.210 --> 21:24.170
And your
own future.

21:24.170 --> 21:27.040
Remember, I can
turn you back...

21:27.040 --> 21:29.290
anytime I want.
