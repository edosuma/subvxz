WEBVTT

00:03.738 --> 00:07.072
Let's get in there, guys.
You know the drill.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.377
I've got a cluster of containers

00:11.379 --> 00:12.778
in the shipyard's
northeast sector.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.580
I'm uploading a map to you now.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.683
All right, you got another
40 units right here,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.084
near-mint condition.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.420
Door!

00:25.359 --> 00:27.760
ED: Open up the container,
throw your weapons out!

00:27.762 --> 00:29.161
Do it now!

00:33.801 --> 00:36.035
(whispers):
She's exposed right here.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.136
Let me see.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.539
Can you get her?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.508
I can ricochet it
as a forehead shot.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.675
You see it, take it.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.054
So, grab.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.355
Oh, okay.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.057
And step back, step back.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.092
Come on. Who is this guy?

01:00.094 --> 01:01.260
What, you getting tired?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.395
Come on. Leave something
in the tank.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.431
Okay, grab.
Slowly, slowly.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.765
All right, good.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.100
Oh, yeah, got it.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.234
Hold him down there
like... (laughs)

01:09.236 --> 01:10.736
Hey, look who it is.
Look who it is.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.271
Look who it is!

01:14.175 --> 01:15.441
Hey, guys!

01:15.443 --> 01:16.608
Hey, Sophie.
Hey-hey!

01:16.610 --> 01:18.510
You got that glow thing
going on, huh?

01:18.512 --> 01:19.511
How you feeling?

01:19.513 --> 01:20.546
Good.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.347
What are you doing
on your feet?

01:22.349 --> 01:23.849
Doc says I'm okay
as long as I don't

01:23.851 --> 01:25.117
exert myself
too much.

01:25.119 --> 01:25.784
You look terrific.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.187
Hey.
Hello. How are ya?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.822
Good. I thought I'd come
by and say hello.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.123
What's going on?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.561
PARKER:
Let's sweat!

01:35.563 --> 01:36.862
All right, let's
get back to it.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.432
Can we go somewhere and talk?

01:40.434 --> 01:43.502
Yeah.
Okay.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.442
So what are you thinking?

01:50.444 --> 01:54.146
I'm thinking you got 'em
set up pretty good.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.514
(sniffing)

01:55.516 --> 01:57.182
What are you doing in there?

01:57.184 --> 01:59.518
Taking a leak.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.388
You want details?

02:04.658 --> 02:05.757
Another drink?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.593
No, I'm good, thanks.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.128
You sure?

02:09.130 --> 02:10.829
I got a 16-year-old scotch
over there.

02:10.831 --> 02:11.897
It's like poetry in a bottle.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.199
You're trying to put me off
my game.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.801
Let's talk business.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.904
All right.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.873
So, what do you like?

02:20.875 --> 02:22.474
I really need you.
I'm not even supposed

02:22.476 --> 02:23.809
to be out of bed right now.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.810
And it's not gonna get easier.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.911
It's just gonna get harder.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.312
So, Clark's around.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.747
Clark's 15.

02:29.884 --> 02:33.385
Look, we've done this before,
we will figure it out.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.386
Your job's different now, okay?

02:34.388 --> 02:36.889
I'm supposed to rest,
I need help.

02:36.891 --> 02:37.890
And I'm gonna help.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.558
With what,
two-hour workouts a day?

02:39.560 --> 02:42.928
Night shifts, overtime shifts?

02:42.930 --> 02:46.398
What am I supposed to do?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.501
Just, just tell me,
and I will do it, okay?

02:49.503 --> 02:52.938
My mother's expecting me
in the morning.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.241
I've already packed my bags.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.919
Your bags are packed?

03:06.921 --> 03:09.288
It'll be easier
for both of us.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.690
I just, I want to get
through this pregnancy

03:11.692 --> 03:12.925
and do some thinking.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.261
Okay.

03:16.263 --> 03:21.934
Okay, if it's better... it's
better for you and the baby.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.636
It's just for a while?

03:26.507 --> 03:29.942
Give me more time with Clark,
anyway.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.778
Ed, Clark's coming with me.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.864
Tell me who your
buyers are again.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.967
I didn't tell you in
the first place.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.802
Kinda like to know
who I'm dealing with.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.905
Yeah, and my guys like
to keep a low profile.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.740
A hundred grand.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.609
Sweet.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.010
Deposit's only ten.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.712
Consider the rest
a finder's fee.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.013
Generous.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.316
I was hoping it might, uh...
move things along.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.519
Definitely
expedite things.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.288
When can I see the rest?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.456
How's tonight sound?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.523
Tonight?

04:18.525 --> 04:19.625
Everything goes tonight.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.526
You're at the front
of the line now.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.764
(chuckles)
Tonight, tonight's good.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.799
Just need to make
a couple of calls.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.601
What can you tell
me about this?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.003
Fully automatic,
fully concealable.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.704
That baby's a game changer.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.039
Wait'll they hit
the streets.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.041
Nine millimeter,

04:36.043 --> 04:37.042
very sensitive,

04:37.044 --> 04:38.510
single or multi shots.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.044
1,200...

04:39.546 --> 04:40.979
Whoa!

04:40.981 --> 04:42.381
Damn!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.650
Thing kinda fires itself,
you know?

04:44.652 --> 04:45.751
Give it to me.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.321
Safety on.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.523
Sorry, Nick.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.792
Crank the stereo.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.327
Anybody comes knocking,

04:55.329 --> 04:57.562
we're testing out
the surround sound, all right?

04:57.564 --> 05:00.866
Let's pack and move.
Pack it up. Let's go.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.571
Nick...

05:06.573 --> 05:07.506
Strike three.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.042
(hard rock blaring)

05:13.347 --> 05:14.713
Let's go!

05:14.714 --> 05:16.080
Pack it up and move!
Get the boxes!

05:16.083 --> 05:17.916
Let's go!
Get it out of here!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.318
Come on!
Pack it all up!

05:19.320 --> 05:21.987
Get him out of here!
Let's go! Go!

05:21.989 --> 05:24.489
¶ ¶

05:25.926 --> 05:27.326
Let's go!

05:31.598 --> 05:32.964
How's she doing?

05:32.966 --> 05:33.965
She's fine.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.967
Just fine?

05:35.968 --> 05:37.968
Ah, she's going to stay
with her mother for a while.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.004
Why's that?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.605
She says it'll be easier.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.374
For how long?

05:42.376 --> 05:45.477
I don't know.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.079
You're okay with that, huh?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.483
It's what she wants.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.784
Team One, suit up. Hot call.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.686
Let's go.
(alarm blaring)

05:55.956 --> 05:59.991
(sirens wailing)

05:59.993 --> 06:02.027
Winnie, what do we know?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.395
Shots fired. 172 Beechmont.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.564
A neighbor called it in.
She said she was

06:05.566 --> 06:07.065
reading her daughter
a bedtime story

06:07.067 --> 06:08.133
when she heard gunfire.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.735
How many shots fired?

06:09.737 --> 06:10.920
She couldn't tell.

06:10.921 --> 06:12.104
Said it sounded like
firecrackers going off.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.606
Machine guns.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.640
And then really loud music.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.476
Thanks, Winnie.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.044
Machine guns in Rosedale.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.947
Anyone who's got that kind of
gear, I say we get in his face.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.615
We gotta let him know
that he's overpowered

06:23.617 --> 06:25.384
before he can take this thing
any further.

06:25.386 --> 06:28.153
In your face is good with me.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.155
(sirens wailing)

06:40.401 --> 06:41.767
Guys, let's check
these perimeters.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.136
Sam?
Okay.

06:45.472 --> 06:49.741
This is Sergeant Parker with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.612
We need to know if there are any
injured parties in there.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.714
(loud rock playing)

07:07.194 --> 07:08.794
Movement, green wall.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.564
Mike, take the back!

07:12.566 --> 07:15.434
Eric, garage! Go!

07:20.174 --> 07:22.040
(frustrated grunt)

07:22.042 --> 07:24.910
(rock music playing)

07:31.618 --> 07:33.552
WORDY (over radio):
Motion here, black wall.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.719
All right,
minimum two occupants.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.105
Anything else to go on?

07:37.106 --> 07:39.490
Well, just that they and their
possible victims are

07:39.493 --> 07:40.959
probably hard of hearing
right now.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.030
We go in there,
headsets are useless.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.765
Spike, who owns this house?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.133
Not a who but a what.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.503
67034 Holdings, to be precise.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.472
A numbered company owns a house
in this neighborhood?

07:53.474 --> 07:54.806
Automatic gunfire?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.941
Organized crime?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.642
A long way from the strip club.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.044
Spike, keep digging.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.879
Basically my plan.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.215
Boss, we got to get
in there now.

08:03.217 --> 08:06.485
PARKER (over radio):
Team, let's regroup.
We're going in the front.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.786
Officer...
Yeah?

08:07.788 --> 08:10.155
get your guys to lock down
a perimeter,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.224
notify all the neighbors
to stay away from their windows.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.258
Copy, sir.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.594
(loud rock continues)

08:16.830 --> 08:18.763
Nick!

08:18.765 --> 08:20.031
They're surrounding
the place!

08:20.033 --> 08:21.833
We're gonna need
more ammo! Let's go!

08:21.835 --> 08:24.236
Mike, get the blinds!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.672
There's only one way out, fast!

08:27.674 --> 08:28.940
You said the garage
is soft.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.509
Only one man
out back so far!

08:30.511 --> 08:32.043
Go back! Wait for us!

08:32.045 --> 08:34.546
Police! Police! Right there!

08:34.548 --> 08:35.614
Police!

08:35.616 --> 08:37.883
SRU! Police!
Lock it!

08:37.885 --> 08:38.850
Police!

08:41.188 --> 08:44.556
(rock music continues playing)

08:45.926 --> 08:49.227
Take heat. Cover the door!

08:49.229 --> 08:50.562
What are you doing?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.265
No, no, no, no, come on!

08:53.267 --> 08:54.666
Forget the ammo, man! Let's go!

08:54.668 --> 08:56.001
I got a way out!

08:56.003 --> 08:57.302
Let's get out of here!

08:57.304 --> 08:58.770
Hang on a minute!

09:01.575 --> 09:04.709
(rock music continues)

09:17.858 --> 09:20.892
(rock music continues)

09:34.341 --> 09:36.308
(rock music continues)

09:42.916 --> 09:44.683
Don't move!
Drop your weapon
right now!

09:44.685 --> 09:45.817
Drop it on the ground!

09:45.819 --> 09:47.652
Hands on your head!
Up against the wall!

09:53.026 --> 09:53.892
(man grunting)

10:15.916 --> 10:17.682
(clip clicking)

10:26.026 --> 10:27.225
Come on!

10:28.328 --> 10:30.362
Nothing yet.

10:36.837 --> 10:40.372
(beeping)

10:50.350 --> 10:52.217
(beeping)

10:54.888 --> 10:58.823
(rock music continues)

11:06.400 --> 11:09.668
(beeping)

11:09.670 --> 11:11.703
Hold fire! Hold fire!

11:11.705 --> 11:13.805
(rock music continues blaring)

11:16.043 --> 11:17.676
Ed, it's your brother!

11:17.678 --> 11:20.278
(music continues blaring)

11:20.280 --> 11:21.446
Ed, it's your brother!

11:22.883 --> 11:26.685
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

11:56.817 --> 11:59.184
Hold fire!
Ed, it's your brother!

11:59.186 --> 12:00.318
(music blasting)

12:00.320 --> 12:02.854
Constable, cut the power.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.823
I need it cut now. Go! Go!

12:04.825 --> 12:06.758
(music continues blasting)

12:14.267 --> 12:15.800
(music stops)

12:17.738 --> 12:19.871
Hold fire! Hold fire!

12:19.873 --> 12:20.905
Hold. Hold. Hold.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.808
Stay down.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.247
Spike, what's going on?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.049
Check your PDAs.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.193
Roy.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.395
Is your brother working
some case undercover?

12:44.397 --> 12:45.764
Roy's not undercover.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.931
He's Guns and Gangs.
They have a unit.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
Sam, he's not on active duty
right now.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.901
You sure about that?
Boss,

12:49.903 --> 12:50.935
he was suspended
a month ago.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.036
What for?

12:52.038 --> 12:54.906
(guns firing)

12:54.908 --> 12:55.907
Officer down!

12:55.909 --> 12:57.225
ED:
<i> You were there, Sam.</i>

12:57.226 --> 12:58.542
<i> The Sunrise Motel. </i>
Officer down!

12:58.545 --> 13:00.845
<i> He disobeyed a direct order</i>
<i> to stand down</i>

13:00.847 --> 13:02.847
<i> and wait for the SRU.</i>

13:02.849 --> 13:04.249
Let's go!

13:09.122 --> 13:10.288
We're supposed
to just wait around...

13:10.290 --> 13:11.856
You got something
to say here, Roy?

13:11.858 --> 13:12.891
We didn't hear
any orders.

13:12.893 --> 13:13.958
You had orders to wait.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.026
We didn't hear it.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.162
This didn't have
to happen.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.530
Huh? Has he got kids?

13:18.532 --> 13:21.900
Has he got kids, Roy?

13:21.902 --> 13:24.135
He cost his partner his life.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.804
Reckless endangerment.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.939
You reported Roy?
Yeah, I did.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.974
What was I supposed to do?
Lie? Look the other way?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.476
We had a sit-down--
I told him,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.812
"I will be there for you, but
you have got to make it right."

13:33.814 --> 13:35.146
And he looked me
right in the eye--

13:35.148 --> 13:36.848
right in the eye--

13:36.850 --> 13:38.583
and promised me that he would.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.084
If he's not on duty,
what's he doing in there?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.820
I don't know, Sam.
I guess he's making new friends.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.255
Ed, he's a Lane.
And that's the only
thing we have in common.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.358
He's a cop.
Who's been looking for an
easy way out his whole life.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.995
Spike, put a call out to
Roy's sarge in the 12 Division.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.965
Maybe he can tell us
what's going on.
Got it.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.267
In the meantime, Roy's a cop
whose cover we cannot blow.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.936
As far as his associate
in there

13:57.938 --> 14:00.905
is concerned,
he's a stranger to us.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.407
We need a new tac plan.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.576
We should go less lethal.
Wordy, you did recon.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.444
Are there any windows
into that room?
Yeah.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.612
A couple small ones.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.014
I'm on it.
All right.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.353
They been watching us.
We're gonna have to
kick it up a bit.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.921
They got a perimeter by now.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.456
There's no way out.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.924
There's always a way out.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.960
What are you going to do?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.628
Didn't get to where I am
by giving up, man.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.463
We are not going
to outshoot SRU.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.298
If we plan it right, we do.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.102
I got a hold
of Sergeant Gamboli, Roy's C.O.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.537
He's calling you right now.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.538
(cell phone buzzing)

14:33.540 --> 14:35.106
Sergeant Gamboli?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.541
Hey, thanks for calling.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.909
(sighs)

14:37.911 --> 14:40.411
Tell me Roy Lane
is working undercover.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.081
Uh-huh.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.952
Frosted windows-- no visual.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.487
I'm going to have
to cut through.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.508
Through this door,
there's a hallway.

14:53.509 --> 14:55.059
On the right, you got
the laundry and the bedroom.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.361
On the left, you got

14:56.362 --> 14:57.662
the staircase going upstairs
to the main hall.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.564
Now, you got to cover me,
all right?

14:59.566 --> 15:02.467
Right.
Between the dining room and
the kitchen, I'm all exposed.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.539
On this side,
there's a stand of trees.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.375
It's a perfect spot
for a sniper to hide.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.676
You take the sniper
out first,

15:11.678 --> 15:13.978
then you lay cover fire
this way. Got it?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.079
I'll lay cover from here,

15:15.081 --> 15:17.081
then we're in the car,
and we're gone.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.516
All right?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.084
Yeah.
Good.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.319
Hey. Relax.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.288
Remember what
you're carrying there.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.023
It's a spray and pray.
It'll mow them down.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.459
Let's suit up.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.031
We've got a problem.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.332
Sam, what do you got?

15:34.333 --> 15:35.632
Shatterproof glass--
can't cut through it.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.035
All right. This guy's prepared.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.336
Get back here.
Let's find another way in.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.637
Copy that.

15:42.075 --> 15:42.707
Thanks.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.175
(whispering):
Eddie.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.978
Any aggression,
containment fire only.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.647
Sergeant Gamboli,
12th Division, confirms it.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.282
Roy isn't active.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.383
And...?

15:52.385 --> 15:53.584
(sighs)

15:53.586 --> 15:55.453
Turns out he went down
to the station today

15:55.455 --> 15:57.088
to get something
out of his locker.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.723
After he left,

15:58.725 --> 16:01.125
$100,000 was missing
from evidence lockup.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.062
Are they sure
that he took it?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.396
Yeah, Eddie.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.732
Gamboli said,
since he lost his partner,

16:07.734 --> 16:10.702
he's been showing up to the
station emotionally volatile,

16:10.704 --> 16:12.370
and he's been self-medicating
with alcohol.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.938
He's always been trouble.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.505
Hey, Eddie, we've all
known a little trouble.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.208
You ever get your
partner killed?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.643
No.
Or steal 100 grand

16:18.645 --> 16:19.711
out of evidence to start

16:19.713 --> 16:21.413
a new career
in weapons trafficking?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.114
That is what we in the business
call jumping to conclusions.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.984
Now, I don't care how
he supplements his income.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.353
We just want everyone in
this house to come out upright.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.588
Now, do we need
a more objective team leader

16:30.590 --> 16:32.991
for this call?
No, sir. I am good.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.192
You sure?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.326
I'm good.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.594
Spike...

16:36.596 --> 16:37.729
Spike, we're going to talk.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.030
What's the word?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.264
Subject one's Nick Watson.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.133
He's suspected of controlling

16:42.134 --> 16:44.001
a third of the arms traffic
coming into the city.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.470
Big fish.
SPIKE (over radio):
And slippery.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.105
Nobody's been able
to pin him down personally.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.439
But I got something.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.575
Our CI says he's the one
that supplied the weapons

16:50.577 --> 16:52.110
that were seized
at the Sunrise Motel.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.780
That's the shotgun
that got Roy's partner killed.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.348
It came from Nick Watson.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.517
Okay. Let's go.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.320
So this is either business
or personal for Roy.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.223
He goes undercover solo
just to get payback up close?

17:05.225 --> 17:06.491
PARKER:
We'll sort it all out

17:06.493 --> 17:07.558
when everyone's safe.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.793
Roy knows the drill.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.161
We maintain his cover,

17:10.162 --> 17:11.528
he surrenders as a
subject, we sort it

17:11.531 --> 17:13.031
all out back at the station.
Copy?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.665
Copy.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.267
Sam, any trouble,
you gas them out.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.302
Ed?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.606
I'm good. Let's focus.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.107
All right.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.509
One last time.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.110
Cover fire, stairway
to the kitchen,

17:26.112 --> 17:28.746
cover first door, cover second
door, left to the deck.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.615
Let's go.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.250
PARKER:
Nick Watson.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.621
This is Sergeant Parker
with the Police

17:36.623 --> 17:38.089
Strategic
Response Unit.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.524
We understand
you have

17:39.526 --> 17:41.092
some serious firepower

17:41.094 --> 17:42.727
on your side of the door,
and so do we.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.195
So, what do you say
we don't waste

17:44.197 --> 17:46.164
all this good ammunition
on each other,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.266
and talk instead?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.770
Okay.
PARKER:
Okay.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.238
I'm going to open
the door slowly

17:54.240 --> 17:57.175
so we can talk
face-to-face, all right?

17:57.177 --> 17:58.409
Okay.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.211
You open it slowly.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.313
I'm going to unlock
the door now.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.865
Back off! Back off!
All of you! Right now!

18:20.867 --> 18:23.701
Do it now, or I
will blow his head off!

18:31.578 --> 18:32.710
Back off, all of you!
Right now!

18:32.712 --> 18:33.845
NICK:
Hank...
ROY: Shut up!

18:33.847 --> 18:35.413
Hank, what the
hell are you...
Shut up!

18:35.415 --> 18:36.815
What are you doing?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.216
Shut up, or I will
take you out right now!

18:38.218 --> 18:39.817
Stand back.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.519
Hank!
I am walking out
of here,

18:41.521 --> 18:43.187
and he's coming with me.
Hank...

18:43.189 --> 18:45.890
PARKER:
Hank? It's Hank, right?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.559
You're throwing us
a curveball here, buddy.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.227
We don't want to do anything
that we hadn't thought through.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.529
You're making a choice
you're going to regret.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.331
Maybe you think you
don't have the choices,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.733
but we've got all night
to talk about those choices.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.902
You know what?
There is somewhere I need to be,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.537
and I don't
have all night.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.139
You get me?
Get out of the way!

19:01.141 --> 19:03.241
We can't let you do that.
Yeah, you can.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.409
You have to keep
my hostage alive,

19:05.411 --> 19:07.778
so either you shoot me
and save this guy's life

19:07.780 --> 19:09.580
or you let me go.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.283
You follow?
This is short-term thinking.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.619
Now, what my boss
just said to you

19:14.621 --> 19:16.387
is the best advice
you're going to get today.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.923
I'm walking.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.358
ED:
Okay.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.293
Now, I'm pretty sure
this isn't

19:22.295 --> 19:23.861
how you wanted today
to play out.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.630
You can make this
right, okay?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.931
You can make
it right.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.533
Just put the gun down now.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.867
Do you understand me?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.170
You know what?
I don't need your attitude,

19:32.172 --> 19:34.172
Officer. You follow?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.841
I know what I'm doing,

19:36.843 --> 19:40.444
and you need to get
out of my way now.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.479
No.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.613
Let's stay calm.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.348
Hold fire!

19:46.319 --> 19:47.451
Boss?

19:47.453 --> 19:49.220
You heard right. Hold fire.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.558
Officer Scarlatti.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.626
Sir?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.895
Instruct all units
to stand down.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.397
The subject
will be exiting the house

19:59.399 --> 20:01.732
with a hostage, and
we are not to follow.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.234
You copy that,
Officer Scarlatti?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.535
We are not to follow.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.970
SPIKE:
I'm hearing you, boss.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.339
I'll take care of it.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.809
PARKER:
The command is to
stand down, Team One.

20:17.217 --> 20:17.882
Stand down.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.548
Now, we don't want
anybody hurt, right?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.885
That's important,
right, Hank?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.721
Team One, the command
was to stand down.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.690
Shoot him.
Shut up.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.862
We're coming out!

20:35.335 --> 20:36.867
ROY:
You got your keys?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.536
Yep.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.541
Open the door.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.576
Get in.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.378
Put your hands
on the dash.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.313
Put them on the dash!

20:56.522 --> 20:57.555
They're letting us go.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.724
You don't talk. You don't move.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.459
(silenced gunshot,
metallic clanging)

21:04.330 --> 21:06.597
(tires squealing)

21:06.599 --> 21:08.466
He threatened a teammate,
and we just let him walk?

21:08.468 --> 21:09.600
He wasn't going
to shoot his brother.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.535
Right, we know that,
but Nick didn't.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.337
It's where he goes next--
that's what I'm interested in.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.672
It's a big gamble, boss.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.407
He said,
"I got someplace to go."

21:16.409 --> 21:17.542
He said, "I know
what I'm doing."

21:17.543 --> 21:18.676
Now, maybe he thinks
he can't afford

21:18.678 --> 21:20.611
to be taken into custody
right now.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.946
He said, "You follow me."

21:21.948 --> 21:23.414
Right?

21:23.416 --> 21:24.615
So we're going to follow.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.317
Boss, we got to move.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.818
Just let them have
some distance, Eddie.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.487
You heard his sarge.
He has gone rogue,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.622
and now he's got his
partner's killer in his hands.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.524
If he wanted Nick Watson dead,
he'd be dead by now.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.429
(beeps)

21:38.431 --> 21:39.697
I got him.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.999
He's heading south
towards the Queensway.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.467
Okay, good work, Spike.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.869
JULES:
So, Roy's got a choice.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.837
The satisfaction
of killing the guy

21:46.839 --> 21:49.340
or the satisfaction
of shutting down his operation.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.008
Cutting off a third
of the city's arms supply

21:51.010 --> 21:52.009
at the source.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.544
He's got to be
leading us there.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.979
I think you're right, Sam.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.380
Guys, Roy's car is stopping.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.499
Where?
I just lost the signal

21:58.500 --> 22:00.617
at Queensway and Kipling. Right
at the tracks-- the overpass.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.321
It's pretty secluded.
Maybe he didn't want to do it
in front of us.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.856
You still think
I'm jumping to conclusions.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.525
Let's go.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.595
(door closes)

22:15.835 --> 22:17.702
Get out of the car.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.570
You better think real hard about
what you're doing right now.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.372
We're switching cars.
They'll be looking for yours.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.574
I thought
we had a plan.
Plan changed.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.742
There's only two of us.
We were outgunned.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.077
I don't like surprises.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.411
Which is why it worked.
You were really scared.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.746
That's why the cops bought it.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.081
Oh, so you're thinking
on your feet.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.415
You coming or what?

22:31.417 --> 22:33.384
We got a head start,
but not for long.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.959
(engine starts)

22:42.995 --> 22:44.795
(tires screeching)

22:44.797 --> 22:47.565
(sirens wailing)

22:57.610 --> 22:59.677
(sighs)

22:59.679 --> 23:02.113
Do you mind
giving me that thing?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.026
It's too bad about your house.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.695
I got spares.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.964
Your guys have been picked up
by the cops now.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.633
Is that going to
cause a problem?
We're on a
need-to-know basis.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.702
Those guys know nothing.
No worries.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.706
So we still good to go?

23:30.076 --> 23:32.143
Are we?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.712
Are we?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.046
Easy.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.882
Easy, it's your call, brother.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.883
My call?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.951
It is now, isn't it?

23:40.953 --> 23:42.486
It certainly is.

23:42.488 --> 23:45.589
You're at the front of the
line, baby. You're first.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.058
(cackling)
You wanna go?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.960
Where to?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.629
Just keep going.
Okay.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.130
You like that?

23:53.132 --> 23:54.632
(Roy laughs)

23:58.638 --> 24:01.172
No sign of them.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.607
You think Roy could have had
his own car here?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.075
Could be...

24:05.077 --> 24:06.577
Why would he
park here?

24:06.579 --> 24:09.113
Would you bring your own car
to a gun buy?

24:09.115 --> 24:12.516
Ed, do you know
what make and model
your brother drives?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.187
No idea.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.955
I'll look up his records.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.082
(door closes)

24:28.083 --> 24:29.599
Hey, guys, I got another
read on the GPS tracker.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.101
It's heading south
towards the shipyards.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.103
WORDY:
He switched the tracker
onto his own car

24:33.105 --> 24:34.505
so we could follow.

24:34.507 --> 24:35.973
Then why'd he bother
changing vehicles?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.075
Make a point, earn
the trust of his partner.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.678
That's not too shabby
for a Lane.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.915
(doors opening)

24:49.255 --> 24:50.821
(engine starting)

24:56.629 --> 24:57.962
This is my office.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.164
You didn't strike me
as a cubicle kind of guy.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.499
No?

25:01.501 --> 25:04.068
NICK:
After you.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.506
(sirens wailing)

25:08.508 --> 25:11.008
SPIKE: Ed, Roy's car is three
kilometers ahead of you,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.644
straight down the street,
outside the shipyards.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.645
Copy.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.815
Right behind you.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.284
All right, I got your
bank account numbers.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.553
All you got to do now is
transfer the remaining balance

25:22.555 --> 25:25.289
to this account number
right here...

25:25.291 --> 25:27.141
and we're done.

25:27.142 --> 25:28.992
We're done?
Yeah, we're done.
Make the call.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.594
All the goods are here.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.263
You can send your people over
for a pickup

25:32.265 --> 25:33.597
as soon as we're settled.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.798
Nick, no offense, but, uh,

25:34.800 --> 25:35.966
don't you think we're
fast-forwarding

25:35.968 --> 25:37.301
here, just a little
bit, you know,

25:37.303 --> 25:38.702
considering the level
of our acquaintance?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.538
Usually I get a good look

25:40.540 --> 25:42.740
before making a
commitment of this size.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.311
It's just business.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.313
Yeah, I understand.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.850
(calling out):
Matt!

25:52.852 --> 25:55.152
Dan! Come here.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.821
Matt, give Brendan a call.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.024
Get him to check out
Hank's bank account.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.126
Get him to call me if
there's any complications.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.194
Stick that in the vault.
Yeah.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.864
Dan... check him out.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.568
What?

26:11.571 --> 26:14.972
(chuckling)

26:17.677 --> 26:19.109
Easy.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.780
It's funny.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.283
Didn't see you grabbing
that one at the house.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.851
It's paid for.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.820
Is there a problem?

26:29.822 --> 26:30.821
Well...

26:30.823 --> 26:33.757
Just business.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.944
Okay, Greg, Roy led us here.
Let's see what we can find out.

26:53.946 --> 26:54.945
Left the keys in the car.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.647
You want to grab them?
Yeah.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.115
PARKER:
Checking the trunk.

27:05.157 --> 27:08.092
PARKER: Your brother's
been busy, Eddie.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.860
What do you mean?

27:10.796 --> 27:12.863
He's been
trailing them.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.865
PARKER: Looks like he's
been working the case

27:14.867 --> 27:17.968
against Nick and his
associates for about a month.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.169
Since he was suspended.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.005
He's off the job,
his partner's been killed...

27:21.007 --> 27:22.339
And somewhere out there
is the guy

27:22.341 --> 27:24.008
who put all these guns
on the street.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.010
And he's trying to take
him down personally.

27:26.012 --> 27:29.179
Prove to everyone that he was
a good cop after what happened.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.115
Let's get in there.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.956
Wordy.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.895
WORDY (sighing):
Spike...

27:44.897 --> 27:48.132
what are we looking at?
Motion sensor.
Little guy.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.134
Look for a red wire
attached to a photo cell.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.069
I don't see it.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.370
Remove the cap from the side.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.139
That'd be helpful.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.107
I got it.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.142
Cut it.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.877
(snips wire)
Done.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.011
WORDY:
Sam?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.113
(cutter snapping chain)

28:03.115 --> 28:04.748
(soft grunt)

28:04.750 --> 28:07.885
Let's get in there, guys.
You know the drill.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.092
PARKER:
Spike, what do we got
on the warehouse?

28:15.094 --> 28:16.760
Owned by the same numbered
company

28:16.762 --> 28:18.328
that owned the house.

28:18.330 --> 28:22.232
67034 Holdings,
AKA Dagmar Trade Services.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.467
Good work, Spike.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.035
Service with a smile.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.037
This is the center of ops
for the gun runners.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.073
Roy was in a hurry
to get us here tonight.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.941
Maybe he's sitting
on a shipment.
Well, if he is,

28:30.943 --> 28:32.242
he doesn't have
enough cash to back up
what's in the bag.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.945
Or he's counting on us
to get him out fast.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.181
Before his friends
figure out who he is.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.449
Sam, Jules.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.422
Spike, what about
that floor plan?

28:45.424 --> 28:48.258
Sorry, Ed, the zone's uncharted.
We're gonna have to eyeball it.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.827
SPIKE: It's basically
a square structure,

28:49.829 --> 28:51.261
70 meters by 60.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.497
Single story, front access,
white wall.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.932
Loading dock, side door,
red wall.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.767
On my go.

28:57.503 --> 28:58.969
Let's hit it.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.919
(indistinct man's voice
in distance)

29:21.427 --> 29:23.193
(welding torch buzzing)

29:24.196 --> 29:25.829
(explosions)

29:26.332 --> 29:28.365
Police!
Police!
SRU!

29:28.367 --> 29:30.134
Hands on your head!
Hands in the air!

29:30.136 --> 29:32.069
Let's go, right now!
Hands on your head!

29:32.071 --> 29:33.504
Against the wall!
Up against the wall!

29:33.506 --> 29:35.339
Against the wall now!
Get your hands down!

29:35.341 --> 29:36.440
Put your hands down!

29:36.442 --> 29:38.041
Jules, gun.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.476
Spike, three subjects acquired.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.978
No Hank, no Nick.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.013
We're looking for Nick Watson

29:43.015 --> 29:44.281
and his associate Hank.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.449
Where are they?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.151
Nobody's talking?

29:50.256 --> 29:51.822
You want me to break the rules?

29:51.824 --> 29:53.557
You want me to?
'Cause I will.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.193
I will.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.296
Eddie, shipping manifest,

29:59.298 --> 30:01.298
listing containers
belonging to Dagmar.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.500
We find the containers...
We find Nick and Hank.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.202
Spike, I need you to contact

30:05.204 --> 30:07.571
the port authority
to locate some containers.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.274
(blipping)
I'm sending you an image now.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.309
Let's get these guys
and throw them in a container.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.111
ED:
Let's go!
Let's go!

30:24.089 --> 30:26.156
All right, we got
another 40 units right here.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.858
Near-mint condition.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.393
Again, these are
all untraceable.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.928
Well, the serial numbers,
they all filed down?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.963
Yeah. We use acid.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.100
(beeping)

30:37.102 --> 30:38.435
I've got a cluster of containers

30:38.437 --> 30:40.304
in the shipyard's northeast
sector.

30:40.306 --> 30:43.207
I'm uploading a map to you now.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.244
These I've sold before,
but not these.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.979
These are good.
The teenagers like those.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.214
You move them fast.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.548
I like it.
Good.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.183
So it's a deal?
Yeah.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.419
Just waiting on those numbers.
Let's pack it up.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.369
(gun firing)

31:13.539 --> 31:15.105
(groans, gun firing)

31:16.242 --> 31:17.341
Door!

31:21.046 --> 31:22.246
(groaning, gun firing)

31:25.217 --> 31:26.617
Don't move.
Don't move a muscle.

31:26.619 --> 31:29.319
One subject down.
Northeast perimeter is clear.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.088
PARKER: Copy that.
Team, take your positions

31:31.090 --> 31:32.489
around the container.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.203
ED:
This is the police!

31:46.205 --> 31:47.337
Open up the container.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.306
Throw your weapons out.
Do it now!

31:49.308 --> 31:52.242
Got the déjà vu, Hank?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.144
Got any theories?

31:54.146 --> 31:57.047
Yeah. Yeah, one of
your guys talked.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.615
My guys don't know
this place.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.151
Come out with your hands
where we can see them.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.152
Do it now!

32:02.154 --> 32:03.320
Eddie, we got an opening?

32:03.322 --> 32:04.955
Tear gas.
Flush them out.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.690
Take them down.
ED:
It's too risky.

32:06.691 --> 32:08.424
If there's ammo in there,
the whole thing will blow.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.260
Nick, we got enough
firepower here.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.396
We're just gonna
have to fight
our way out.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.197
The ammo travels
separately, you idiot.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.399
You ought to know that.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.067
That's an anti-
hijacking precaution.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.069
All we got is what
we're holding right here.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.170
PARKER:
Hank!

32:21.607 --> 32:23.073
Nick!

32:23.075 --> 32:25.208
Sergeant Parker again.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.210
We seem to be spending
an awful lot of time

32:27.212 --> 32:29.713
on opposite sides of the door,
so what do you say,

32:29.715 --> 32:31.648
we come up
with a better strategy?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.320
You with me?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.055
Let's do it.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.328
Get the light.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.335
(door creaking)

32:51.337 --> 32:53.036
Door.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.040
All right, let's talk.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.244
Nick, you and your buddy
Hank there had us worried

33:01.246 --> 33:04.715
for a minute, with that
false-hostage maneuver...

33:04.717 --> 33:07.150
That was well-played-- the
both of you-- well-played.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.252
Thanks.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.455
PARKER: Now, we both know
the damage we can do,

33:11.457 --> 33:13.590
so let's not
go there, okay?

33:13.592 --> 33:16.293
(whispers): She's exposed,
right here. Right here.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.562
Let me see.
What do you you say
we keep this simple,

33:18.564 --> 33:21.398
look for a way to have
everyone walk out of here?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.367
NICK: Can you get her?
PARKER:
How's that sound?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.902
MATT:
There's a pole.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.436
I can ricochet it
as a forehead shot.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.371
You see it, take it.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.407
PARKER:
Nick! Come on.

33:30.409 --> 33:34.411
I don't see any point in
underestimating each other here.
Out of range... come on.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.380
You're a smart individual.

33:36.382 --> 33:41.118
Running an operation like this,
undetected for so long...

33:43.722 --> 33:46.423
So I know you're smart
enough to talk about

33:46.425 --> 33:48.392
realistic options
right now.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.727
All right, there's a
couple ways this can go.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.730
Hank?
Just trying to think
of a realistic option.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.633
And what do you think?
I think there's no way we're
walking out of this one.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.636
Ah, yeah, we are.
We do it my way this time.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.338
PARKER:
Come on, Nick.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.040
We take her out,
use the distraction,

34:03.042 --> 34:05.442
blast our way out of here.
PARKER:
Can you hear me?

34:05.444 --> 34:07.544
I just need
to know that...
She's back.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.379
(groans, gunshot)

34:16.655 --> 34:18.355
Cop!

34:18.357 --> 34:20.490
Yep.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.392
You got me when I was greedy.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.529
I should have
listened to my gut.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.064
Sergeant Parker!

34:29.535 --> 34:32.803
It's Roy Lane.
The game's changed.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.448
Sergeant Parker!

34:45.417 --> 34:46.616
He's blown his cover.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.252
Cover him.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.323
(beeping)

34:54.460 --> 34:55.625
One of them's down.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.497
Sergeant Parker, you hear me?!

35:00.499 --> 35:03.333
Yeah, yeah, we're trying to...

35:03.335 --> 35:05.602
trying to understand
the situation in there.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.238
The subject on
the ground...

35:08.240 --> 35:09.639
Out cold, but he's fine.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.576
Okay.
Okay, that's good to know.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.411
So, what do you say we
open things up a bit,

35:14.413 --> 35:15.796
let some light in there?

35:15.797 --> 35:17.180
It's always helpful
to see faces.

35:20.385 --> 35:21.551
Hold fire, hold fire.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.520
Fan out.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.158
Sam, get in position.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.826
Come on.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.364
Come on.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.635
PARKER: Let's break this down,
gentlemen.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.671
Neither one of you wins right
now by firing your weapon.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.379
Roy, you played all your cards
right here tonight.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.883
Now, you had a chance to kill
this guy, and you let him live.

35:52.885 --> 35:56.920
You have made the smart choice.
Now, let's figure this out, now!

35:56.922 --> 35:59.589
I let him live so that
he'd bring us here.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.791
Right now I'm not seeing
the point so much.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.266
You're done.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.768
Roy?
Okay, come on, buddy.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.937
Roy? Roy, listen to me.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.373
Gonna shoot me?
Huh, Nick?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.375
Gonna shoot me?
Go ahead?
Roy!

36:18.377 --> 36:21.444
Won't make a damn bit of
difference if you shoot me.
Roy!

36:21.446 --> 36:22.612
But Jerome Brant--

36:22.614 --> 36:26.616
<i> my partner, my best friend--</i>

36:26.618 --> 36:28.785
now there's a guy who should
still be on his feet.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.588
There's a guy who should still
be breathing.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.291
There's a guy who'd be tucking
his kids into bed right now!

36:34.293 --> 36:34.925
Roy!

36:34.927 --> 36:36.226
He killed my partner!

36:36.228 --> 36:37.627
He didn't know your partner.

36:37.629 --> 36:38.929
He put that shotgun
out on the street...

36:38.931 --> 36:41.464
If I didn't do it,
somebody else would have.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.466
You think he has any idea, Ed?
Roy, I need you to
listen to me here.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.635
You think he sees...
Okay, just for one second.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.370
...what the kids do to each
other with those guns?

36:47.372 --> 36:49.839
I did not create the demand.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.509
You think this...
this piece of garbage...

36:52.511 --> 36:54.644
Roy?
...knows what that looks like?

36:54.646 --> 36:57.214
Don't preach to me.
Don't preach to me.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.682
Want to know what it feels like?

36:59.484 --> 37:00.550
Yeah, show me.
Show me.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.385
Come on, shoot me.
Roy?

37:02.387 --> 37:03.987
You're better than this.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.455
I know you are.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.856
Do it, go ahead.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.592
Preach to me.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.260
(chuckling)

37:11.663 --> 37:13.496
I know you are.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.433
(sighs)

37:21.473 --> 37:23.673
You, too, Nick.
Let's end this.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.277
It's over. (sniffles)
It's over.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.451
(sighs)

37:35.287 --> 37:36.253
(gunfire)

37:36.255 --> 37:37.587
Roy!

37:37.589 --> 37:38.421
(groans)

37:38.423 --> 37:39.656
Roy!

37:39.658 --> 37:41.358
What the hell were you doing?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.459
We need a medic.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.631
Roy!
(groans)

37:47.633 --> 37:50.567
He's got a vest.
He's got a vest.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.503
(grunting)
Okay, come on.
You're all right.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.608
Let's go.
(groans)

38:00.712 --> 38:02.512
He's dead, boss.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.381
Come on.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.297
(indistinct conversations)

38:27.739 --> 38:29.572
You okay?

38:29.574 --> 38:30.840
Yeah. Guy was gonna
shoot a cop.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.709
Let's go.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.450
Thanks, guys.
All right.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.451
Thanks, man.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.520
Great job.
Thanks, man...

38:47.359 --> 38:49.659
Boy, you are in
for a ride here.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.795
This-This rogue business,

38:51.797 --> 38:54.431
the stealing money...
I know.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.966
I didn't think
you had it in you.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.803
I know.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.872
You kept the peace, Roy.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.674
Yeah?
Yeah.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.677
I am gonna put in a word,

39:07.679 --> 39:11.348
and we are gonna get
you back on the job.

39:11.350 --> 39:15.919
¶ Don't look away,
don't close your eyes ¶

39:15.921 --> 39:21.758
¶ I'm falling
with your gravity ¶

39:25.397 --> 39:26.763
I am so proud of you.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.932
Love you, man.

39:28.934 --> 39:32.769
¶ Am I brave enough
to cross that line ¶

39:32.771 --> 39:37.674
¶ And come undone through your
space and mine? ¶

39:37.676 --> 39:42.145
¶ With these
two worlds alone... ¶

39:42.147 --> 39:45.749
A third of the city's gun
supply, stopped at the source.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.784
That's a start.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.719
He took 'em on single-handed.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.888
He had a lot to prove, Eddie.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.823
Yeah.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.658
You guys make good?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.127
Yeah.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.028
Good.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.830
Oh, and what about
the other thing?

40:00.832 --> 40:02.399
What do you mean?

40:02.401 --> 40:04.601
I mean about Sophie staying
with her mom.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.035
I'm okay.

40:06.037 --> 40:09.172
I mean, it's okay. She...

40:09.174 --> 40:12.642
She's gonna get some rest.
It's just for a while, so...

40:12.644 --> 40:16.746
Last time I came home to an
empty house, it stayed that way.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.048
That's not what this is about.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.918
I'm just saying-- go careful.

40:35.066 --> 40:42.939
¶ With gravity ¶

40:48.880 --> 40:53.783
