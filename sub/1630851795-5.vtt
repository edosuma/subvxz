<i> [narrator] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:09.908
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i>  any old-timer</i>

00:09.910 --> 00:12.277
that's been involved
in this craft will tell you

00:12.279 --> 00:14.780
water's the most
important ingredient.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.849
Is there any chance
you'd let us set up here,

00:16.851 --> 00:18.017
make a little liquor?

00:18.019 --> 00:20.319
That's a...
That's a big question.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.887
Now, it's time to meet
the green fairy.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.288
Let's go get her.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.792
<i>  Our buyer wants to pay</i>
<i>  $250 for this</i>
<i>  one gallon of absinthe.</i>

00:26.794 --> 00:28.761
<i>  But if we can impress him</i>
<i>  with this product,</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:31.063
there's no telling
how much money we can make.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.999
Ooh! To hell with liquor,
we're gonna make pie.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.268
<i>  We're gonna do a trade</i>
<i> but we've never run any brandy</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.269
in this new rig.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.138
Damn it! So wet, man.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.105
<i>  If we can't make it work,</i>

00:40.107 --> 00:42.274
we're gonna be out
thousands of dollars.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.378
<i> [digger] this is how</i>
<i>  we make the moonshine.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:52.117
[suspenseful music playing]

00:53.954 --> 00:57.156
<i> [digger] it's our</i>
<i>  last resort right here.</i>

00:58.759 --> 01:01.527
<i> [narrator] just north</i>
<i>  of cocke county, tennessee,</i>

01:01.529 --> 01:03.796
<i>  mark and digger</i>
<i>  take a long shot</i>

01:03.798 --> 01:07.066
<i>  on gaining access to a prized</i>
<i>  source of limestone water</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:09.368
<i>  for their tennessee whisky.</i>

01:09.370 --> 01:12.738
<i>  The problem is that source</i>
<i>  is owned and operated</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:14.973
<i>  by a legitimate business.</i>

01:14.975 --> 01:18.043
We've looked tail west and
crooked for limestone water.

01:18.045 --> 01:18.811
Well,

01:18.813 --> 01:19.945
I guess no luck.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.981
<i>  At this point, this is</i>
<i>  the only option we've got.</i>

01:22.983 --> 01:26.018
If we can't find
a good source of
limestone water,

01:26.020 --> 01:28.120
<i>  where we can set up and run,</i>

01:28.122 --> 01:31.056
<i>  then we're dead in the water</i>
<i>  on tennessee whiskey.</i>

01:31.058 --> 01:33.959
-And we're kinda
out of choices here.
-Right.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.294
Can I help you?

01:36.163 --> 01:37.362
[digger] well, hey, john.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.897
Do you happen to remember us?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.099
I do.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.800
Been a while since
I've seen you all.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.202
Well...

01:43.204 --> 01:45.971
-We're like bad money,
we'll always turn up.
-How you doing, buddy?

01:45.973 --> 01:47.072
<i> [mark] the english mountain</i>
<i>  spring water.</i>

01:47.074 --> 01:49.541
This is the greatest water
in the world.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.111
<i>  We've always got water there</i>
<i>  for tempering our liquor.</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:54.279
But we've got to
have access to it

01:54.281 --> 01:56.215
where we can
set a still site up.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.750
We're kinda up a stump, um,

01:58.752 --> 02:01.553
we're kinda on a bended knee
right now, if you will.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.789
We'd like to talk
about your water.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.224
<i>  John's a business man,</i>

02:05.226 --> 02:08.527
I'm kind of a business man,

02:08.529 --> 02:11.063
and I approached it from
that angle with him.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.064
We really was wondering

02:12.066 --> 02:14.333
if you'd care if
we captured a little of it?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.269
We've emulated
tennessee whiskey pretty good,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.271
and that involves

02:19.840 --> 02:20.873
good

02:20.875 --> 02:23.342
hard limestone water.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.044
Your water's hard enough that
it will suit our purpose.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.714
I don't see how
we can go wrong

02:28.716 --> 02:29.848
with your water.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.752
But we got to have
your blessing as well.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.021
<i>  You know, I don't know really</i>
<i>  what john's thinking,</i>

02:36.023 --> 02:37.823
his legitimate business here,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.725
<i>  and digger</i>
<i>  and myself wanting to</i>

02:39.727 --> 02:41.994
participate in
illegal activities.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.129
[john] well, you know,
I'd have to think about it
a little bit,

02:44.131 --> 02:45.831
but I think we can definitely
sit down

02:45.833 --> 02:47.199
and have a chat.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.701
He's not shutting us out
completely.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.769
<i>  That's a good sign.</i>

02:50.771 --> 02:52.671
[john] come on in,
see what we can find out.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.206
[digger] age before beauty
there, hey.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.108
[john] come on back, guys.
We'll show you around.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.209
[digger] you got a lot of
cameras in here.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.045
-That makes us nervous.
-[john laughs]

03:00.047 --> 03:00.946
<i> [john] well, our spring</i>
<i>  puts out about</i>

03:00.948 --> 03:03.081
<i>  2.5 million gallons</i>
<i>  of water a day.</i>

03:03.083 --> 03:06.218
<i>  Our water has</i>
<i> a very unique chemistry to it.</i>

03:06.220 --> 03:07.553
<i>  There's a lot</i>
<i>  of minerals in there,</i>

03:07.555 --> 03:08.887
<i>  potassium, magnesium.</i>

03:08.889 --> 03:11.256
<i>  Things that give it</i>
<i>  that unique taste.</i>

03:11.258 --> 03:15.027
<i>  But all that stuff is really</i>
<i>  engineered by nature.</i>

03:15.029 --> 03:16.028
-That's something else.
-Amazing.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.429
Well, let's head outside.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.766
<i> [digger] this hillside</i>
<i>  that leads up</i>

03:20.768 --> 03:21.600
<i>  to english mountain,</i>

03:21.602 --> 03:23.535
<i>  the forest here is untouched.</i>

03:23.537 --> 03:26.772
John said that he's traced it
back to the early 1800s.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.173
You'll notice that

03:28.175 --> 03:30.909
tree that's right up there
has got a real unique
bend to it.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.111
I was doing some
research online

03:33.113 --> 03:35.013
about native american history
and

03:35.049 --> 03:36.248
what I found was

03:36.250 --> 03:39.084
native americans had
a tendency to fix those

03:39.086 --> 03:40.852
so they could mark a spot.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.921
So, I figured that
that's a marker tree.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.524
I can't say for real that
that is,

03:45.526 --> 03:48.327
but it looks identical to
everything that I saw online.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.029
-[digger] yeah,
it's been there a while.
-[mark] yes, it has.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.465
Looky there, puss.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.766
<i> [digger] that's a spring</i>
<i>  right there.</i>

03:54.768 --> 03:57.803
<i>  You don't see anybody's</i>
<i>  water bubbling up that big.</i>

03:57.805 --> 03:58.971
<i>  This water's beautiful.</i>

03:58.973 --> 04:01.473
<i>  Gem-clear water running</i>
<i>  right out of the mountains.</i>

04:01.475 --> 04:03.675
<i>  Water travels through</i>
<i>  that limestone spring,</i>

04:03.677 --> 04:06.812
it picks up the minerals
out of that limestone.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.647
[john] we've got a valve
inside the plant,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.148
-so when we're
not processing...
-Wow!

04:10.150 --> 04:12.718
...That water goes back
to a settling pond.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.219
It just goes right back
into the environment,

04:14.221 --> 04:16.688
<i>  so we don't anymore</i>
<i>  than what we need.</i>

04:16.690 --> 04:18.123
<i>  That water is constantly</i>
<i>  moving.</i>

04:18.125 --> 04:19.992
<i>  -We never let it</i>
<i>  sit in a pond.</i>
<i>  -Yeah.</i>

04:19.994 --> 04:21.193
<i> [digger] you don't get</i>
<i>  no closer to the source</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:22.227
<i>  than you do right here.</i>

04:22.229 --> 04:23.895
<i>  Down through there,</i>
<i>  I saw green rocks,</i>

04:23.897 --> 04:26.031
and that's an
indication of copper.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.233
<i>  First thing I see on</i>
<i> these rocks, that green color.</i>

04:28.235 --> 04:31.003
That tells me that
that's copper in those rocks.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.537
<i>  So, that's a good sign that</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:34.773
<i>  this water's some of the best</i>
<i>  if copper's in it.</i>

04:34.775 --> 04:36.108
<i> [mark] you know,</i>
<i>  this water's so clear,</i>

04:36.110 --> 04:39.978
-if it was 100 feet deep,
you could see the bottom.
-[john] yeah.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.848
English mountain spring water,
it's incredibly famous.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.049
<i>  It won an award for</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:46.184
<i>  best-tasting water</i>
<i>  in the world.</i>

04:46.186 --> 04:49.054
And, you know, I would love
to have access to it.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.890
We know it's fantastic water.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.159
Would you be opposed to us
bringing a little, small still

04:54.161 --> 04:55.761
in here and doing a little

04:55.763 --> 04:58.497
experimental run
and see what it'd do?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.000
Could be a selling point
on down the line, you know,

05:02.002 --> 05:03.835
there might be some
big distillery somewhere

05:03.837 --> 05:05.070
wanna come in here and

05:05.072 --> 05:07.172
buy tanker truck loads of it.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.573
You could say,
"hey, look here

05:08.575 --> 05:11.410
what this water makes
when it comes to alcohol."

05:12.780 --> 05:13.845
well,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.213
you know,
I've always wondered,

05:15.215 --> 05:17.082
you know,
what else it could do.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.484
I think we could...

05:19.486 --> 05:21.687
I can allow you to make a--
maybe a small run.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.555
I don't need to know
anything about it.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.058
-Fair enough.
-If that's agreeable, then
the two of you--

05:26.060 --> 05:29.227
-that's very agreeable.
-Well, I'ma climb up on a rock
to shake your hand, my friend.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.495
I think that's, too...

05:30.497 --> 05:31.863
I think it's very kind of you.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.132
<i> [digger] I can't remember when</i>
<i>  I've been any more excited</i>

05:34.134 --> 05:36.101
<i>  about making</i>
<i>  one run of liquor.</i>

05:36.103 --> 05:38.603
This is a dream come true
for this old boy.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.938
If you had told me no,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.006
I'd have been just as happy
going out here,

05:41.008 --> 05:42.140
because of what I got
to come look at.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.042
<i> [john] well,</i>
<i>  I appreciate that.</i>

05:51.318 --> 05:53.485
[mike] it's cold and rainy.
He better hurry up.

05:54.121 --> 05:54.786
Sorry I'm late.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.555
I reckon so.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.858
<i> [narrator] two counties south</i>
<i>  across the state line,</i>

<i>  with a surplus of</i>
<i>  in-season blueberries.</i>

-How y'all guys doing?
-[mike] what's happening,
man?

06:07.201 --> 06:08.934
Let's take a look
at these berries,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.669
see what kind of taste
we got in 'em.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.937
Check 'em out.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.505
You know, butch,
he's a local farmer,

06:13.507 --> 06:14.606
uh, a friend of ours,

06:14.608 --> 06:17.576
and he's got a crap ton
of them blueberries for us.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.177
<i> [jerry] you know, I'm pretty</i>
<i>  excited about making brandy.</i>

06:19.179 --> 06:21.079
<i>  Especially in this</i>
<i>  new still design we got.</i>

06:21.081 --> 06:22.914
We're gonna be able
to make a small batch

06:22.916 --> 06:24.349
<i>  of high-quality shine</i>

06:24.351 --> 06:26.885
with a charred oaky flavor

06:26.887 --> 06:28.019
like none other.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.055
[butch] they ought to
make y'all some fine brandy.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.757
<i> [mike] butch loves</i>
<i>  our moonshine.</i>

06:31.759 --> 06:33.225

<i>  so we're gonna do a trade.</i>

06:34.995 --> 06:36.561
So, he gives us his product

06:36.563 --> 06:37.863
and we give him ours.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.364
<i>  Butch will get the first cut</i>

-Oh, my god!
-Ooh!

06:42.970 --> 06:45.170
The hell with liquor,
we're gonna make pies.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.738
Pies and pancakes.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.906
<i> [mike] these blueberries</i>
<i>  are fine, man.</i>

06:47.908 --> 06:50.609
Big rabbiteye blueberries,
really sweet,

06:50.611 --> 06:53.378
<i>  and there's some mixed in,</i>
<i>  it's got a little</i>
<i>  tartness to 'em.</i>

06:53.380 --> 06:55.647
<i>  Top-damn-shelf blueberries,</i>
<i>  I can tell you that.</i>

06:55.649 --> 06:57.549
And I believe this is gonna
make some good brandy.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.651
Seem to be good berries,
so I'm looking forward

06:59.653 --> 07:01.086
to a good high yield
off of 'em.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.822
They got plenty of sugar,
they should yield pretty good.

Well, you're looking at
the two that can
make it for you

07:05.225 --> 07:06.725
and make it right.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.860
I hope so, blueberries
is prime right now.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.197
I'm looking at 750 a barrel,
$1,500.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.866
[jerry] we can give you
the first run off
of these blueberries.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.934
All we need is time.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.035
About how long?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.270
About a month.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.271
You're looking at
about a month.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.939
So, if you can wait on us,

07:20.941 --> 07:23.008
we'll put the best
blueberry brandy in your mouth

07:23.010 --> 07:24.075

-All right.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.315

we'll load 'em up.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.383
Appreciate you, brother.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.051
With all these blueberries
that butch is given us,

07:33.053 --> 07:35.554
it ought to make several
damn runs of brandy.

<i>  We've got a good deal</i>
<i>  going on here.</i>

07:37.758 --> 07:38.990

07:38.992 --> 07:41.460
we'd be out
thousands of dollars.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.700
[jerry] tell you what,
if this blueberry tastes
as good as that rye did,

07:48.702 --> 07:51.036
man, we got no trouble
getting rid of it.

07:51.038 --> 07:51.937
<i> [mike] if this</i>
<i>  blueberry brandy turns out</i>

07:51.939 --> 07:53.171
<i>  the way I expect it to,</i>

07:53.173 --> 07:55.774
me and jerry, we stand to make
a lot of damn money.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.076
<i>  But, we've never run any</i>
<i>  brandy in this new rig.</i>

07:58.078 --> 08:00.912
You never know how
a new recipe's gonna turn out

08:00.914 --> 08:02.247
<i>  till you taste it</i>
<i>  out the money pot.</i>

08:02.249 --> 08:04.115
<i>  You never know</i>
<i>  what you gonna get.</i>

08:04.117 --> 08:06.351
<i>  This might be</i>
<i>  a bust or a fail.</i>

08:06.353 --> 08:08.320
<i>  If butch don't take</i>
<i>  this liquor for payment,</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:09.554
<i>  we owe him some money,</i>

08:09.556 --> 08:10.555
one way or another.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.457
We got us a few more barrels.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.261
And, by god,
these things are heavy.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.763
Whoo, man you ready
to cut some holes?

08:18.765 --> 08:19.931
[jerry] let's do it to it.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.834
We're gonna mash inside
the actual pot itself,

08:22.836 --> 08:25.704
<i>  but, you know,</i>
<i>  we've got 600 pounds</i>
<i>  of blueberries here.</i>

08:25.706 --> 08:26.671
<i>  If you don't hurry up</i>
<i>  to get it</i>

08:26.673 --> 08:28.240
fermenting the way
it needs to be,

08:28.242 --> 08:30.575
they'll spoil on you,
then you can't use 'em.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.977
<i>  These traditional barrels</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:32.911
<i>  and some white oak</i>
<i>  charred barrels,</i>

08:32.913 --> 08:35.046
<i>  cut the lids out of 'em</i>
<i>  and mash 'em in.</i>

08:35.048 --> 08:38.850
It'll give the same concept
of what we're doing
in the pot itself.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.185
<i>  We gotta mash</i>
<i>  these blueberries up,</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:41.820
<i>  just like anything else.</i>

08:41.822 --> 08:42.821
<i>  So, I've got a fruit press,</i>

08:42.823 --> 08:43.855
<i>  a manual one.</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:45.690
<i>  We'll just throw these</i>
<i>  blueberries in there</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:46.591
<i>  and turn the knob.</i>

08:46.593 --> 08:48.360
<i>  Two different set</i>
<i>  of gears in there</i>

08:48.362 --> 08:50.161
<i>  that just sucks that fruit</i>
<i>  down in there and crushes it,</i>

08:50.163 --> 08:52.130
<i>  and throws it</i>
<i>  right in the barrel for you.</i>

08:52.132 --> 08:53.532
<i>  Then we can put</i>
<i>  our hot water in on it</i>

08:53.534 --> 08:55.100
and steep it in,
and it's good to go.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.568
And putting this on it
right here,

08:56.570 --> 08:57.969
we're gonna have something

08:58.372 --> 08:59.571
wrapped and ready.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.872
Ho-ho!

09:00.874 --> 09:04.743
That's gonna make some
blueberry kool-aid
right there, baby.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.944
<i>  When you mash in</i>
<i>  a fruit mash,</i>

09:05.946 --> 09:07.746
<i>  you turnin' it into</i>
<i>  wine first.</i>

09:07.748 --> 09:09.915
You distill it off
and make a brandy out of it.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.683
<i>  This is a little bit</i>
<i>  longer process,</i>

09:11.685 --> 09:12.951
<i>  but</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:15.120
everybody in america
wants something different.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.557
All right, buddy, we'll get
this blueberried up and in.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.125
<i>  They want something new.</i>

09:20.127 --> 09:21.927
They love to see
the times change

09:21.929 --> 09:23.862
and that's what
me and jerry's doing now.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.864
Gonna be a lot of money, son,
if all this works out.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.632
Five barrels of mash
sitting here.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.935
-And after the rye run
that we made...
-Yeah.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.937
...And putting berries in
on top of that,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.039
man, it's gonna be good,
bubba.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.908
We put about 20 gallons
of blueberries per barrel.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.176
<i>  These white oak</i>
<i>  charred barrels,</i>

09:38.178 --> 09:40.278
<i>  it's gonna give</i>
<i>  a really great</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:42.814
<i>  deep and bold flavor</i>
<i>  to this mash.</i>

09:42.816 --> 09:44.015
<i>  This is beautiful sight.</i>

09:44.017 --> 09:46.351
<i>  It smells so good out here</i>
<i>  in these woods,</i>

09:46.353 --> 09:48.086
<i>  I believe it's gonna be</i>
<i>  one of the best runs</i>

09:48.088 --> 09:49.054
we've ever done.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.022
Hell yeah.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.236
What's in your other hand?
You ain't got nothing
in your other hand?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.172
[craig] yeah, both arms full.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.807
They might be
the two lightest things,

10:08.809 --> 10:10.609
but they're both full.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.878
<i> [narrator] three states away</i>
<i>  on the louisiana bayou,</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:17.182
<i>  opportunity is knocking for</i>
<i> richard and his brother craig,</i>

10:17.184 --> 10:20.251
<i>  if they can produce</i>
<i>  an authentic absinthe recipe</i>

10:20.253 --> 10:22.921
<i>  for a discerning new orleans</i>
<i>  bar owner.</i>

10:22.923 --> 10:25.090
I got the magic potion
right here, man.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.791
Let me see what
that smells like.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.093
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.528
-It hit me
straight off the lid.
-Whoa.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.866
Making this absinthe has been
a multistep process.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.968
We started with 30 gallons
of basic sugar wash.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.269
<i>  We ran that through our still</i>

10:38.271 --> 10:40.972
<i>  and got three gallons</i>
<i>  of high-proof neutral spirit.</i>

10:40.974 --> 10:43.408
Then we had to mix in
about a dozen different herbs.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.076
It's green now.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.145
When it comes out that pot,
it won't be.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.380
Yeah, it'll be clear.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.249
<i> Today, we're gonna put it back</i>
<i>  into the still, run it again.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:52.217
That's gonna come down to

10:52.219 --> 10:55.954
one gallon of a very,
very nice white absinthe.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.989
<i>  And then, we're gonna take</i>
<i>  that white absinthe,</i>

10:57.991 --> 11:01.126
and we're gonna turn it
into a green absinthe.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.228
This is a lot
of substance in...

11:03.597 --> 11:04.696
This right here.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.898
<i>  This is a lot of work for</i>
<i>  one gallon of product,</i>

11:06.900 --> 11:09.134
<i>  but this is a real big</i>
<i>  investment into our future.</i>

11:09.136 --> 11:11.302
Our buyer wants to pay $250

11:11.304 --> 11:12.904
for this one gallon
of absinthe.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.939
But if we can impress him
with this product,

11:14.941 --> 11:17.208
<i>  there's no telling</i>
<i>  how much money we can make.</i>

11:17.210 --> 11:18.276
[craig] you don't wanna
strain it?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.244
No, no straining.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.012
We're putting all this
in the pot.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.382
Most of the time,
we would strain.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.784
<i>  But in a situation like this,</i>

11:25.786 --> 11:26.985
<i>  we need the oils</i>

11:26.987 --> 11:29.054
and we need the fragrances
and the taste profiles

11:29.056 --> 11:30.622
that come out from
being in there.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.957
Can't waste any of this, man.
This is precious.

11:32.959 --> 11:36.294
This guy that we're selling
this to is a true absinthian.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.263
We wanna make sure that
it's right when they get it.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.398
<i>  All we gotta do is</i>
<i>  get some water in here.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:41.299
<i>  That water is gonna help</i>

11:41.301 --> 11:43.868
carry over some
of the essential oils

11:43.870 --> 11:45.970
and flavors into our absinthe.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.806
[craig] all the botanicals,
you're not worried about

11:47.808 --> 11:49.007
scorching the pot?

11:49.009 --> 11:51.943
A little bit, but
we're about to get a stick.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.044
We just gotta stir it
in the beginning,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.146
make sure it doesn't stick
to the bottom of the pot.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.248
I'm gonna start
setting stuff up for you.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.919
Man, this actually
smells delicious.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.688
<i>  If this absinthe tastes</i>
<i>  anything like it smells,</i>

12:03.690 --> 12:06.324
man, we are in the green.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.127
My instincts are telling me
we can cap this thing off.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.295
-That's hot.
-It's hot.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.297
I can't wait for this...

12:12.966 --> 12:14.933
To come out of there.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.434
And we can put it in, uh...

12:17.270 --> 12:18.236
Here.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.338
Which is where
it's supposed to be.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.083
[mark] you ready to get busy?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.685
[digger] we gotta get with it.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.987
[mark] we need to pick us out
a spot first, don't we?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.790
Check out and see where
exactly we want to set up.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.592
You know, we got permission
from john

12:40.594 --> 12:42.560
to do a run at
his spring site.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.063
Right there looks like
it's got the best ground
right now.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.898
We're gonna mash in today

12:46.900 --> 12:50.235
<i>  and try to replicate our</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey recipe</i>

12:50.237 --> 12:52.537
<i>  using english mountain</i>
<i>  spring water.</i>

12:52.539 --> 12:54.672
<i>  I mean, honestly,</i>
<i>  if this turns out</i>

12:54.674 --> 12:56.841
a very good,
exceptional product,

12:56.843 --> 12:58.676
<i>  then we gotta</i>
<i>  figure out a way</i>

12:58.678 --> 13:01.546
how to get access to
this water all the time.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.486
[digger]
hang on, I'm gonna hook
that other one up to it.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.955
We got permission to run here

13:10.957 --> 13:12.557
at english mountain spring

13:12.559 --> 13:14.259
<i>  for an experimental run.</i>

13:14.261 --> 13:15.293
What do you reckon?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.328
He didn't understand about...

13:18.131 --> 13:19.531
"hold on, I was gonna connect

13:19.533 --> 13:21.166
the second hose to it."

13:22.035 --> 13:23.968
damn it.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.838
[digger] hell,
before I get close and
he's yanks on it again.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.972
If you don't slow down,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.007
we ain't gonna
have enough hose.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.442
We're no strangers
to wet, muddier

13:32.179 --> 13:33.745
tiresome working conditions.

13:33.747 --> 13:36.481
<i>  I don't mind, but I'm not</i>
<i>  a spring chicken anymore.</i>

13:36.483 --> 13:38.917
<i>  And a damn hose,</i>
<i>  if anything can hook,</i>

13:38.919 --> 13:41.085
hang, tangle, it will.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.053
You got water?

13:42.055 --> 13:43.588
[digger] it's a-coming.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.124
[mark] don't tug on it none.
I hope you got all you need.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.926
[digger] that's about
a full stream right there.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.460
Let's get a-something
a-cookin'.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.064
It's a slow stream,
but it's steady.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.632
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i>  any old-timer</i>

13:54.634 --> 13:57.235
<i>  that's been involved</i>
<i>  in this craft will tell you</i>

13:57.237 --> 13:59.871
that water's the most
important ingredient.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.072
<i>  You don't have good water,</i>

14:01.074 --> 14:02.073
you ain't gonna
make good liquor.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.942
John's doing us a solid,
though,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.176
by letting us
make this run here.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.211
You ain't just a-kiddin'.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.679
Anything that man asks for,

14:07.681 --> 14:10.882
shy of hiding a body,
we need to do it.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.017
Time to get my grain
measured out.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.019
<i>  This holds two pounds,</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:18.022
so I just have to keep track
of how many I dump in there.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.658
We're gonna use
the same grain bill,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.560
<i>  of the barely, corn and rye.</i>

14:22.562 --> 14:25.530
<i>  The water is gonna make</i>
<i>  a huge difference in this.</i>

14:25.532 --> 14:27.599
This water has
been scrutinized

14:27.601 --> 14:28.833
<i>  by the best in the business,</i>

14:28.835 --> 14:31.069
<i>  and it has been declared</i>
<i>  the best water in the world.</i>

14:31.071 --> 14:32.904
<i>  It's good water,</i>
<i>  it'll make good liquor.</i>

14:32.906 --> 14:35.840
But how good
is what we've gotta find out.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.942
Now if you'll get busy
stirring that,

14:37.944 --> 14:40.111
I'll get us another pot going.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.780
<i> [mark] the goal here is</i>
<i>  to produce good liquor,</i>

14:42.782 --> 14:44.649
so, you know,
that's all we wish for.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.117
We're not wishing
for miracles,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.219
<i>  we simply want to</i>
<i>  make a good product</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:50.889
with the ingredients
that we're working with.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.156
All right, you ready?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.424
[digger counts in spanish]

14:54.060 --> 14:55.093
[grunts]

14:55.095 --> 14:58.129
<i>  john, gave me</i>
<i>  a copy of his water analysis</i>

14:58.131 --> 14:59.330
<i>  for the mineral content.</i>

14:59.366 --> 15:02.166
<i>  And, honestly, it's better</i>
<i>  than that spring in town.</i>

15:02.168 --> 15:05.169
Right here is
one of the best still sites
that could ever be.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.238
Let me make motion here
on something.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.239
Making a motion.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.541
Maybe for
future endeavors,

15:11.177 --> 15:12.277
however much this makes us,

15:12.279 --> 15:13.912
let's just give it all
to john.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.113
[digger] I'm all for it.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.881
He might look at us
in a different light

15:16.883 --> 15:19.651
if he likes it really good.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.986
You know, we're having
a lot of conversations about,

15:21.988 --> 15:24.956
<i> if it's good, how are we gonna</i>
<i>  approach john about</i>

15:24.958 --> 15:27.091
maybe staying here or
what we're gonna do to

15:27.093 --> 15:28.760
<i>  continue using this water.</i>

15:28.762 --> 15:31.195
There's a lot of questions
running through our mind.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.131
You know, it maybe
a good opportunity

15:33.133 --> 15:35.266
for john to expand
and, bully for him,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.035
-I'm all for that exactly.
-If we can.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.570
[digger] if this lives up
to our expectations,

15:39.572 --> 15:42.106
then he's gonna have
something to brag on.

15:42.108 --> 15:42.941
Sure he does.

15:42.943 --> 15:43.808
John's a business man

15:43.810 --> 15:45.743
and he's a sharp
business man at that.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.112
<i>  There's a demand</i>
<i>  for limestone water,</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:50.615
<i>  and I'm sure he thinks,</i>
<i>  "well, maybe</i>

15:50.617 --> 15:52.917
we can go further here

15:52.919 --> 15:56.187
and maybe I can start
selling this to distilleries."

15:56.189 --> 15:58.189
I'm ready to dump some of
this yeast in there.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.958
Well, you know,
as it stands,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.160
if this makes the best
tennessee whiskey

16:02.162 --> 16:03.962
that's ever been seen,

16:04.130 --> 16:05.630
then that's another dilemma.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.098
We ain't gonna need
this stuff no more.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.900
-No, we can load it up.
-Let's take it home.

16:08.902 --> 16:12.136
We're not guaranteed
access beyond this run.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.706
<i>  But, maybe if john</i>
<i>  tastes this</i>
<i>  and sees how good it is,</i>

16:14.708 --> 16:17.809
maybe he'll let us continue
on working right here.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.776
[digger] I'll see you
in the morning.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.178
[mark] all right.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.222
[richard] it's coming
in the worm, buddy.
It's in the worm.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.057
[craig] how we looking?

16:33.059 --> 16:34.592
-Where is the coon pecker?
-Here we go.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.760
Boy, we're dripping, too.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.629
-[craig] there we go,
our first drips.
-Looking good.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.264
<i>  We're out here running</i>
<i>  our white absinthe</i>

16:40.266 --> 16:42.200
and we're hoping to
knock it out of the park.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.771
Oh, I'll be damned.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.206
That's a good shine.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.542
[craig]
<i>  when it starts flowing,</i>

16:51.544 --> 16:53.177
I'm blown away.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.813
I could not believe

16:55.815 --> 16:58.383
<i>  all the flavors</i>
<i>  that carried over.</i>

16:58.385 --> 16:59.984
That's pretty damn good.

17:00.020 --> 17:00.718
Man.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.153
This ought to be
against the law.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.988
It is against the law.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.823
This is awesome,
we could deal with this.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.825
I'll drink to that, damn it.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.194
We drink to anything
that is good and positive.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.863
This is absinthe

17:11.865 --> 17:14.165
and this is only
one part of it.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.733
<i>  Now that we have</i>
<i>  our white absinthe,</i>

17:15.735 --> 17:17.402
<i>  we have to turn it green</i>
<i>  by infusing it.</i>

17:17.404 --> 17:19.303
<i>  We have to be</i>
<i>  really, really careful.</i>

17:19.305 --> 17:21.139
We need to get
our color and flavors

17:21.141 --> 17:22.573
perfect on this one.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.242
But we don't have
a lot of alcohol to work with.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.044
<i>  So, we're gonna do this</i>
<i>  in small quantities</i>

17:26.046 --> 17:27.311
<i>  to make sure we get it right.</i>

17:27.313 --> 17:28.780
If we make a mistake on this,

17:28.782 --> 17:30.181
we'll ruin the whole batch.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.549
You got some more lemon balm?

17:31.551 --> 17:32.283
[craig] I got some more.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.985
Now, this is the...

17:34.921 --> 17:36.954
...The raw stuff right here.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.923
I want you to gimme
some of that spearmint.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.758
<i>  As if the work wasn't</i>
<i>  hard enough already,</i>

17:40.760 --> 17:42.560
<i> now we have to balance flavors</i>

17:42.562 --> 17:44.295
<i>  and make sure</i>
<i>  that we turn this green,</i>

17:44.297 --> 17:46.130
and make sure
that the end result

17:46.132 --> 17:47.331
is a proper louche.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.368
<i> A louche is when you introduce</i>

17:50.370 --> 17:52.804
<i>  cold water into absinthe.</i>

17:52.806 --> 17:54.105
It turns kind of

17:54.107 --> 17:56.240
a cloudy opal

17:56.242 --> 17:58.076
<i>  greenish color.</i>

17:58.078 --> 17:59.077
That looks pretty good.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.144
Wormwood

18:01.047 --> 18:02.914
with the lemon balm.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.183
We're using herbs that
we already have as flavor

18:05.185 --> 18:06.818
in our drink already.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.919
<i>  I'm gonna do hyssop.</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:09.087
<i>  There's a balance here</i>

18:09.089 --> 18:10.221
that we're gonna have
to accomplish

18:10.223 --> 18:12.056
between color and flavor.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.125
<i>  We don't wanna</i>
<i>  overpower our absinthe</i>

18:14.127 --> 18:16.094
with something
that's already there.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.129
That's a nice
pretty green color.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.068
You know what?

18:24.070 --> 18:25.169
This [bleep] is good.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.305
This is this.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.139
It is? Let me see.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.540
I swear it is.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.176
There's no change
in the taste.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.245
None, it's only green.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.379
Wow!

18:35.381 --> 18:36.080
And look at it green.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.316
This might be it, craig.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.852
We're gonna see if we can get
a louche with this thing, man.

18:40.854 --> 18:41.919
That's a good idea.

18:41.921 --> 18:42.887
The flavor's perfect,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.188
the color's perfect,

18:44.190 --> 18:46.991
but if this absinthe
doesn't louche properly,

18:46.993 --> 18:48.893
it's not a true absinthe.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.162
<i>  When you add cold water</i>
<i>  into this drink,</i>

18:51.164 --> 18:52.763
the water causes
a chemical reaction

18:52.765 --> 18:53.965
that releases the oils.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.367
The oils bounce around
at the bottom of the glass.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.935
<i>  Kinda reminiscent of</i>
<i>  the little fairy,</i>

18:57.937 --> 18:58.836
<i>  the green fairy.</i>

18:58.838 --> 19:00.538
That's what
a proper louche is.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.840
That's what a proper absinthe
will give you.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.942
We're gonna just
see if it works.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.311
-Ooh, look at that.
-[craig] oh, yes.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.213
Wowie!

19:09.682 --> 19:10.815
[richard] look at that.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.152
This is what
it was supposed to do!

19:15.088 --> 19:16.821
Tell me what it tastes like.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.390
Oh, I can drink this
without burning.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.325
Little slight bitterness,

19:21.861 --> 19:23.027
slight spiciness,

19:23.029 --> 19:24.328
slight liquorish

19:24.898 --> 19:27.198
and my friend, mr. Fennel,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.066
comes through in the middle.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.202
Man, this is so awesome.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.837
It tastes real complex.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.172
<i>  I actually made a drink</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:36.941
that I can taste five
different flavor profiles in.

19:36.943 --> 19:37.875
All right, we got it.

19:37.877 --> 19:38.876
This is the verdict.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.045
Gotta get a good
gallon of that going

19:41.047 --> 19:42.246
and bring it to the man.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.548
<i> And collect the l'argent.</i>

19:43.550 --> 19:45.082
Give me my money.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.317
[craig] I'll drink to that.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.162
Just gonna check this, man.
Make sure it's ready to roll.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.097
<i>  Yeah, our blueberry mash</i>
<i>  has been working off</i>

20:00.099 --> 20:01.365
for a couple of weeks now.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.533
It's time to run this stuff

20:02.535 --> 20:04.235
and see what
it's gonna taste like.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.037
I can drink that
just like that, hey.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.172
That's damn good, son.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.841
We're running our fingers
down in there
and tasting this mash,

20:10.843 --> 20:12.310
it's phenomenal.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.313
That can be strained out
of them barrels
and bottled right now.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.081
<i>  You can taste the char</i>

20:17.083 --> 20:18.216
from the barrel.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.550
<i>  The whole nine yards.</i>

20:19.552 --> 20:21.085
<i>  If we can get half</i>
<i>  of this taste</i>

20:21.087 --> 20:22.687
out the other end of the worm,

20:22.689 --> 20:24.055
we gonna be on to something.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.890
All right, man, if you wanna
start kind of seeing

20:25.892 --> 20:26.958
if you can get a fire started,

20:26.960 --> 20:28.893
I'm gonna get this thing
capped off and connected up.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.194
[mike] all righty.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.129
The unique thing
about our setup,

20:32.131 --> 20:35.933
it's going out of a white oak
american charred barrel,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.735
<i>  fusing that flavor in lightly</i>

20:37.737 --> 20:39.370
<i>  through a clear brandy.</i>

20:39.372 --> 20:40.972
<i>  Well, you know,</i>
<i>  the big question is</i>

20:40.974 --> 20:41.973
<i>  if it's gonna work.</i>

20:41.975 --> 20:43.241
We'll soon find out.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.575
Get her fired up.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.979
We're smoking a little.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.280
Damn it.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.949
It's so wet, man.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.852
That's why it won't light.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.254
<i>  I'm sick and tired</i>
<i>  of trying to make</i>

20:56.256 --> 20:58.155
<i>  wet wood burn in</i>
<i>  this damn thing.</i>

20:58.157 --> 20:59.257
<i>  You know, the whole idea is</i>

20:59.292 --> 21:01.292
<i>  that we didn't have to</i>
<i>  pay for fuel this season.</i>

21:01.294 --> 21:02.960
We've got to come up
with something

21:02.962 --> 21:04.295
more consistent than this,
man.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.063
-We've got too much
blueberry mash sitting here...
-Oh, I get it.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.064
...To run. Five barrels.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.532
-I agree.
-You know.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.067
Especially when we're
running this slow.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.903
I mean,
wonder what could we do
to make it burn consistent.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.772
Well, we just need
a different fuel source.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.141
So, it's got to be either like
charcoal pallets or something.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.844
-They use wood pellets
on a lot of wood stoves now.
-Hmm.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.946
That'd definitely be
a good consistent heat.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.949
All we just need is a little
catch basket to be able to

21:24.951 --> 21:27.251
hold 'em in place 'cause
I can't lay on the bottom.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.853
We pile up,
it'll block our oxygen,

21:28.855 --> 21:30.121
-and it won't burn, so...
-It won't burn.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.656
So we gotta hold
them up a little bit.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.190
If you'll manage right here,

21:33.192 --> 21:34.525
I'll run down here to
the store real quick,

21:34.527 --> 21:35.426
little hardware store.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.994
Try to keep
this damn thing burning.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.997
What me and jerry's thinking,
maybe to go to pellets.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.900
Something that's already been
treated and dried out.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.235
-I'll be right back.
-All right.

21:44.237 --> 21:47.071
Something that'll burn
real hot and clean.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.353
Looks like today
may be the day, puss.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.022
Right here's where
the rubber meets the road.

22:05.024 --> 22:05.956
[both slurping]

22:05.992 --> 22:06.891
ooh!

22:07.160 --> 22:08.526
-It's bitter.
-[digger] got some octane.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.694
I believe it do.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.928
<i> [digger] we're gonna</i>
<i>  run this mash</i>

22:10.930 --> 22:13.030
<i>  that's made out of</i>
<i> english mountain spring water.</i>

22:13.032 --> 22:14.899
We're gonna see
if it does, in fact,

22:14.901 --> 22:17.268
make as good liquor
as we think it's going to.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.473
Just jump up on it,
there you go.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.843
Careful, we don't want it to
go to the center of the earth.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.878
We've got a brand-new still,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.747
<i>  and this one,</i>
<i>  it was custom built</i>

22:29.749 --> 22:30.815
<i>  by a friend of ours.</i>

22:30.817 --> 22:33.084
It's a primo little
piece of equipment

22:33.086 --> 22:36.020
and I'm excited about
putting it to work.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.521
It requires no paste.

22:37.523 --> 22:41.058
It has tri clamp fitting
with neoprene gaskets.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.195
We have access to the thumper
inside should we need it.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.931
It's a state of the art
little still.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.799
[digger] I'm just gonna put
these down here.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.534
Let's see what that gets us.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.737
You'd think, because
we're out in the woods,

22:52.739 --> 22:55.039
we're just slap-happy
willy-nilly. No, we're not.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.241
<i>  We're gonna take</i>
<i>  all the pains we need to</i>

22:57.243 --> 22:59.944
<i>  to make sure we've got</i>
<i>  zero solids in this pot.</i>

22:59.946 --> 23:01.212
<i>  We want nothing to scorch</i>

23:01.214 --> 23:03.714
that would offer any
off-flavors to our run.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.082
I'm a-hopin'...

23:05.084 --> 23:07.852
That this tastes as good,
if not better

23:07.854 --> 23:09.854
than what we made there
at the spring in town.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.890
We want nothing
to get between us

23:12.892 --> 23:15.393
and what we want to see
at the end of this run.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.232
<i>  This thing should</i>
<i>  take off pretty quick.</i>

23:21.234 --> 23:23.000
But you're gonna have to
do something about that hat,

23:23.002 --> 23:24.268
it's growing damn
canker in it.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.036
That black mold's
growing right there.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.138
[mark] oh, that ain't
black mold,

23:27.140 --> 23:30.141
that's lard and [bleep] off
my fingers.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.042
That's what feeding that mold.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.045
Man, there's another story.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.113
[digger] we're getting...

23:36.549 --> 23:37.982
...Hot here.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.017
Oh, hell yeah, boy!

23:40.019 --> 23:41.819
We better get us a catch jug.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.088
<i>  We only have permission</i>
<i>  to do one run here.</i>

23:44.090 --> 23:46.657
It's a catch-22.
If this is really good liquor,

23:46.659 --> 23:47.958
<i>  we may have a problem,</i>

23:47.960 --> 23:49.093
<i>  we're not allowed</i>
<i>  to stay here.</i>

23:49.095 --> 23:50.895
If it isn't as good

23:50.897 --> 23:52.029
as what we've been running,

23:52.031 --> 23:53.998
where do we go from here?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.933
[digger] we gotta
catch heads here.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.067
[mark] there we go, heady.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.937
English mountain spring water
tennessee whi'key.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.071
[digger] well, you know,
it's the way

24:01.073 --> 24:03.174
tennessee whiskey's
supposed to be made.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.542
-In tennessee.
-In tennessee.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.722
That ain't nothing but fine.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.959
Boy, it's good though.
Damn, it's just perfect.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.894
Liquor that good
will mess you up.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.664
Oh, my god!
Can you imagine when it
comes out of the barrel?

24:26.666 --> 24:29.200
<i> [digger] this liquor</i>
<i>  is outstanding.</i>

24:29.202 --> 24:31.836
<i>  It's better.</i>
<i>  It's got a sweeter note.</i>

24:31.838 --> 24:34.205
<i>  Everything comes across</i>
<i>  well in the palate.</i>

24:34.207 --> 24:36.073
It's a shame that
we can't set up here

24:36.075 --> 24:37.842
and just make camp right here

24:37.844 --> 24:39.176
and work for
a couple of years.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.012
This is the water source

24:42.014 --> 24:43.247
for tennessee whiskey.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.082
<i>  I won't ever</i>

24:45.084 --> 24:47.084
miss that water
in town again...

24:47.086 --> 24:49.987
-No.
-...If we can have this water.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.723
<i> [mark] I think it's</i>
<i>  better than</i>
<i>  what we've been making.</i>

24:52.725 --> 24:55.092
<i>  It's dandy, dandy liquor.</i>

24:55.094 --> 24:57.561
This is where our problem
just begins.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.964
<i> Now, we have got to find a way</i>

24:59.966 --> 25:01.765
<i>  to get permanent access</i>

25:01.767 --> 25:02.666
to this water.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.035
<i>  This is a dilemma for us bad.</i>

25:05.037 --> 25:06.770
[digger] if he loves it,
then we're in business,

25:06.772 --> 25:08.239
he'll want more of it.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.252
[richard] come see.
This is what
we got to do real quick.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.152
What you got?

25:22.154 --> 25:24.088
And don't laugh at
how I draw.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.689
This is that fountain.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.058
Absinthe has a bit of
a ceremony to it.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.027
It starts by
dripping cold water

25:30.029 --> 25:31.328
<i>  into the liquid.</i>

25:31.330 --> 25:33.764
<i>  This process is</i>
<i>  called a louche.</i>

25:33.766 --> 25:34.899
I'ma gonna call tim, man.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.268
I mean, he helped us out
on our first deal.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.069
-He helped us out on
everything...
-Oh, man, everything.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.271
...And everything else.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.739
We're gonna build
an absinthe fountain.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.908
Drinking absinthe is
a whole ritual,

25:43.910 --> 25:46.176
and the fountain is
the center of it.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.144
<i> [tim on phone] hello.</i>

25:47.146 --> 25:48.913
Tim, are you in town?

25:48.948 --> 25:50.314
<i>  Yeah.</i>

25:50.316 --> 25:52.016
I need some help. You think
you can give me a hand?

25:52.318 --> 25:53.150
<i>  All right.</i>

25:53.152 --> 25:54.718
All right, I'll see you then.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.820
<i>  I wanna build</i>
<i>  an absinthe fountain because</i>

25:56.822 --> 25:59.990
I wanna present this product
the proper way.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.026
<i> [narrator] at the peak of</i>
<i>  absinthe's popularity</i>

26:02.028 --> 26:04.028
<i>  in the late 1800s,</i>

26:04.030 --> 26:06.897
<i>  european bars and cafes</i>
<i>  developed tools</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:08.999
<i>  known as absinthiana</i>

26:09.001 --> 26:11.168
<i>  to enhance</i>
<i>  the drinking experience.</i>

26:11.170 --> 26:13.871
<i>  The most important was</i>
<i>  the absinthe fountain,</i>

26:13.873 --> 26:16.140
<i>  used to slowly drip ice water</i>

26:16.142 --> 26:18.175
<i>  into a round of</i>
<i>  absinthe glasses</i>

26:18.177 --> 26:19.944
<i>  for a proper louche.</i>

26:19.946 --> 26:22.580
<i>  By the turn of</i>
<i>  the 20th century,</i>

26:22.582 --> 26:25.816
<i>  fountains emblazoned with</i>
<i>  the logos of absinthe makers</i>

26:25.818 --> 26:29.253
<i>  could be found in bars</i>
<i>  from paris to new orleans.</i>

26:29.255 --> 26:31.889
<i>  The center piece</i>
<i>  of a social ritual</i>

26:31.891 --> 26:34.391
<i>  forever tied to</i>
<i>  the liquor itself.</i>

26:35.761 --> 26:37.861
[richard] that looks
like it's tim.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.763
Tim can do this
while he's sleeping.

26:39.765 --> 26:40.731
<i>  Tim's been with me</i>

26:40.733 --> 26:42.766
since the beginning of
my moonshining days.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.835
-Tim, what's going on tim?
-What's up, rich?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.837
-What's happening man?
-[tim] how y'all doing?

26:46.839 --> 26:49.340
Tim's a master plumber,
he's an architect also.

26:49.342 --> 26:50.874
<i>  He's really into</i>
<i>  things like this.</i>

26:50.876 --> 26:52.176
<i>  I need tim's help</i>

26:52.178 --> 26:53.944
<i>  because I don't have time</i>
<i>  to mess around with this.</i>

26:53.946 --> 26:54.845
We're meeting this buyer
tonight,

26:54.847 --> 26:56.080
and this fountain
needs to work.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.848
What y'all trying to do?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.717
This is
an absinthe fountain, man.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.186
The only way to
truly enjoy absinthe

27:02.188 --> 27:04.888
is to, uh, take some
cold water, some ice water,

27:04.890 --> 27:06.557
and just drip it in slowly.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.225
What you think?

27:08.227 --> 27:10.661
-This sale that--
-you need to make
a dripper.

27:10.663 --> 27:11.962
Something that's gonna drip.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.064
But I need this dripper
to look like something

27:14.066 --> 27:15.699
-that would be...
-Yeah, a pretty dripper.

27:15.701 --> 27:16.834
A pretty dripper.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.068
-[craig] a descent dripper.
[laughs]
-yeah.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.236
I don't see no problem.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.337
-You don't see no problem?
-Nah!

27:20.339 --> 27:21.138
Let's make a dripper.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.906
All right, let's see.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.274
Let's go shopping here in your
truck, tim, what you got?

27:24.276 --> 27:25.142
Man,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.844
I brought an
assortment of stuff.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.113
Brought some copper,
some fittings.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.782
That tubing ought to be
perfect right there.

27:31.784 --> 27:32.783
<i>  Tim's got everything.</i>

27:32.785 --> 27:34.952
<i> I mean, he's got pipe, plates,</i>
<i>  tubing.</i>

27:34.954 --> 27:36.120
I mean, you name it,
he's got it.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.788
You could actually wrap

27:37.790 --> 27:39.723
the copper around.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.291
And that way, it kinda
looks like a worm.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.160
To make it look like
a condenser.

27:43.162 --> 27:43.961
Yeah.

27:43.996 --> 27:44.795
Oh!

27:44.797 --> 27:45.929
Coming from the glass.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.731
I got these little fancy
things.

27:47.733 --> 27:49.033
<i> [richard] we're gonna use some</i>
<i>  basic steel pipes</i>

27:49.035 --> 27:50.768
to build a base
to this fountain.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.302
I think something
like this, richard.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.004
Let me see that jar,

27:54.006 --> 27:55.272
let me see
what that would look like.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.006
[craig] that's perfect.

27:56.008 --> 27:56.974
[richard]
let's do some coiling

27:56.976 --> 27:58.075
and see if we can get
these things

27:58.077 --> 27:59.810
looking like a condenser.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.145
Yeah, I can see it already.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.480
Kind of bore it out
a little bit.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.382
We can take this

28:05.384 --> 28:06.550
and we put that through it.

28:07.019 --> 28:07.785
Wrap the base,

28:07.787 --> 28:09.987
get our worm fabricated.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.156
<i> [richard] for the dripper,</i>
<i>  we picked up some</i>
<i>  copper tubing</i>

28:12.158 --> 28:13.657
<i>  and a couple of small valves</i>

28:13.659 --> 28:15.059
for a nice slow flow.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.027
[tim] like this.
Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.696
[richard] and little spigots.

28:18.698 --> 28:19.997
[tim] good tight end seal.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.132
[richard] get that jar
for me right there.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.867
<i>  When we finish with this,</i>
<i>  it's gonna look like,</i>

28:23.869 --> 28:25.536
it's dripping right from
the worm

28:25.538 --> 28:26.437
out of our still.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.272
[tim] snug it up.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.206
Moment of truth, man.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.075
We gonna find out right now.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.310
But, look,
if this right here works,

28:33.946 --> 28:35.312
I'ma run and jump
in that bayou.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.014
[tim] oh, I gotta see that.

28:38.984 --> 28:39.950
[richard] yeah,

28:39.952 --> 28:41.919
that's what I needed
to see, man.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.020
Oh, yeah! Thank you, bro.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.321
[tim] that's the dripper.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.123
[richard] that's what I needed
to see right there.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.891
<i>  This is the final piece</i>
<i>  of the puzzle.</i>

28:47.893 --> 28:50.394
We got our taste,
we got our color.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.129
Now, we got our presentation.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.263
Man...

28:53.399 --> 28:54.064
Thanks, bro.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.065
No problem.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.934
I just hope it meets
this guy's expectations.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.168
[tim] just holler if you
need something.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.304
-[richard] I sure will.
-[craig] all right,
we sure will.

29:11.817 --> 29:14.051
I don't know, man.
This damn thing.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.120
Looks like I'm coming in
about the right time here.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.421
Yeah, you might be.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.157
I'm sick of it, man.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.525
We're gonna get 'er
done real quick,

29:21.527 --> 29:22.459
right here, just a minute.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.328
<i> [mike] pellets are</i>
<i>  all kinds of hardwood.</i>

29:24.330 --> 29:25.929
It's been kiln-dried,

29:25.931 --> 29:27.231
ground to a powder

29:27.233 --> 29:29.700
and then compressed
into hard little pellets.

29:29.702 --> 29:30.834
[jerry] we'll do the fort
down in there

29:30.836 --> 29:32.102
where it kinda of makes
a "v" in the bottom of it.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.837
-Yeah.
-And then we can just
bring it up

29:33.839 --> 29:35.739
and kind of just fold it
over the top, that'll hold it.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.008
Basically, all we making
is a bird's nest basket

29:38.010 --> 29:40.811
<i>  to set down in this thing</i>
<i>  to pour the pellets in,</i>

29:40.813 --> 29:42.579
<i>  where they'll stop</i>
<i>  at a certain point,</i>

29:42.581 --> 29:43.847
<i>  and where we can light 'em up</i>

29:43.849 --> 29:45.983
and then they'll just
self-feed down through there

29:45.985 --> 29:46.950
<i>  and try to burn.</i>

29:48.053 --> 29:49.853
[jerry] I don't think
it's gonna work, man.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.288
[mike] damn, I hope it does.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.991
<i> [jerry] get her fired up.</i>

29:55.561 --> 29:57.694
Jerry comes waddling on
back into the still site

29:57.696 --> 29:59.029
and he's got
a big bag of pellets,

29:59.031 --> 30:00.430
<i>  which I get in there</i>
<i>  with the thrower,</i>

30:00.432 --> 30:01.965
<i>  blow into to it...</i>

30:01.967 --> 30:03.567
[jerry] oh, she's picking up
steam now.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.568
[mike] yeah, buddy.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.969
It immediately lights up,

30:05.971 --> 30:07.004
<i>  and we're good to go.</i>

30:07.006 --> 30:09.239
I hadn't seen it
burn like that yet.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.874
[jerry] that's a really
consistent burn, too.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.075
It is.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.011
See now, we can
do what we gotta do.

30:14.013 --> 30:14.978
We know it's burning,

30:14.980 --> 30:16.046
it's not going out.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.214
And it's consistently burning

30:17.216 --> 30:19.149
with the right amount
of damn oxygen.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.019
Come to just
stanley gettin' it, baby.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.821
Whoo! I'm liking it.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.088
<i>  This is a brand-new rig</i>

30:25.090 --> 30:27.257
<i>  made of a white oak</i>
<i>  charred barrel.</i>

30:27.259 --> 30:29.193
<i>  We got a copper core going</i>
<i>  through the center of it</i>

30:29.195 --> 30:30.561
<i>  from top to bottom.</i>

30:30.563 --> 30:33.197
<i>  And we're gonna be open flame</i>
<i>  from the bottom</i>

30:33.199 --> 30:35.065
<i> all the way through this core,</i>
<i>  out the chimney.</i>

30:35.067 --> 30:36.233
<i>  It's very important</i>
<i>  to run your liquor</i>

30:36.235 --> 30:37.668
<i>  at a consistent temperature.</i>

30:37.670 --> 30:39.269
You've got to have
that sweet spot

30:39.271 --> 30:41.138
and that's what we got here
with these pellets.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.706
Feel that, jerry.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.108
-That son of gun is getting
warm right there already.
-Whoo-hoo!

30:45.778 --> 30:47.978
Now, this right here
is gonna be

30:47.980 --> 30:49.680
the name of the damn
game for us.

30:49.682 --> 30:52.182
We can run this thing nice
and slow and consistent

30:52.184 --> 30:54.218
and get everything that
we need to get out
of this run.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.019
<i>  It's doing great.</i>

30:57.790 --> 30:59.556
-Nice.
-I say you ought
to be getting close.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.191
Yeah, starting to look like
it's getting a little...

31:01.193 --> 31:02.426
Looky there.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.962
Wowzers, [bleep] yeah!

31:04.964 --> 31:06.063
We got it, don't we?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.731
Look at that stream, son.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.067
[mike] we got alcohol,
don't we?

31:10.069 --> 31:11.335
Smell that--
those notes in there.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.171
Yeah, the notes of them
blueberries, for sure.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.739
-And that char.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:15.741 --> 31:16.940
The char's in there
really good.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.809
It's got a good
rich smell to it.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.143
[mike] that blueberry's
coming through.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.746
You can smell those notes
from the charred barrel,

31:22.748 --> 31:24.081
<i>  from the blueberry</i>
<i>  coming through.</i>

31:24.083 --> 31:26.450
<i>  We gonna wait till it kind of</i>
<i>  tempers itself down,</i>

31:26.452 --> 31:28.151
getting them harsh.
We gonna
take this to swallow.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.420
Now, we're in the business end
of it right now.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.155
That's what we're looking for.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.624
The bed in the sand.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.292
You know, I'm ready to taste
this brandy right now.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.860
I'm getting nervous on
how it's gonna taste.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.195
I can smell those good notes

31:38.197 --> 31:40.030
<i>  coming from the barrel</i>
<i>  and the blueberries.</i>

31:40.032 --> 31:41.965
But it's time to take us
a swallow and see--

31:41.967 --> 31:44.801
see really what me
and jerry's done here today.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.937
Looks like we about
to another jug, brother.

31:46.939 --> 31:47.537
[jerry] we on it.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.941
Don't, don't...

31:50.943 --> 31:52.242
-Don't spill on it.
-Don't spill it.

31:52.912 --> 31:53.911
Let me hold on to that.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.112
We gotta try it, don't we?

31:55.114 --> 31:56.546
I am super excited
about this right here.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.284
There you go.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.954
[mike] I'm smelling
the blueberries

32:03.956 --> 32:05.389
a lot better than
it was before.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.496
Wow.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.866
That's blueberry damn brandy
right there, buddy.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.801
The notes of the charcoal--

32:17.803 --> 32:19.236
-it's there.
-...The chars there.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.138
I'm really, I'm loving this.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.273
Mmm.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.676
This stuff tastes amazing.

32:25.678 --> 32:28.045
<i>  I mean, one of the best runs</i>
<i>  we've ever made.</i>

32:28.047 --> 32:30.280
And we taste like
blueberries but not...

32:30.282 --> 32:31.315
Coated in damn sugar.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.282
Yeah.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.917
[mike] I like it.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.886
It's good.
I believe it'll sell.

32:35.888 --> 32:36.753
I'm tickled with it.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.822
It's got the wood charred
notes in it,

32:38.824 --> 32:41.091
it's got the blueberry
coming through it just right.

32:41.093 --> 32:44.127
<i>  I believe this stuff is gonna</i>
<i>  sell like crazy.</i>

32:44.129 --> 32:46.897
It's perfect, I mean,
don't touch it,

32:46.899 --> 32:48.532
don't fix it
if it ain't broke.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.100
This stuff is great.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.035
[clears throat] that's
about it, ain't it, bubba?

32:52.037 --> 32:53.937
Yeah, we're pushing
right down there

32:53.939 --> 32:55.005
in the bottom of the tails.
So...

32:55.007 --> 32:55.939
Yep.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.174
We don't need to push it
no more.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.842
[mike] all righty.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.043
[jerry] let's get this stuff
loaded up

33:00.045 --> 33:01.078
and get it out of here.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.246
[mike] I reckon it's about
that dadgum, ain't it?

33:03.248 --> 33:05.115
-[jerry] oh, sure is.
-[grunts] oh, damn!

33:05.584 --> 33:06.984
[grunts]

33:07.186 --> 33:08.852
[jerry] this ain't as easy as
carrying the buckets,
though, but...

33:08.854 --> 33:10.153
[mike] hell, yeah! Dang.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.557
Blueberry brandy though, baby.
We have done it, son.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.903
[richard] look at all this
big money over here,

33:26.905 --> 33:28.338
big buildings,

33:29.008 --> 33:29.740
big lights.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.208
This is big money
out here, man.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.010
<i>  We in new orleans, louisiana,</i>

33:33.012 --> 33:34.644
we're on our way to
make a sale right now.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.214
<i>  It's a big city, man, to be</i>
<i>  just walking in and saying,</i>

33:37.216 --> 33:38.849
<i>  "here, look,</i>
<i>  we got shine for you,"</i>

33:38.851 --> 33:39.983
I'm kinda nervous.

33:39.985 --> 33:41.985
It's the first time we've
ever tried anything like this

33:41.987 --> 33:43.687
and we have to put a drink
in front of someone

33:43.689 --> 33:45.022
who knows about it.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.890
What I wanna do is I wanna
stop, get the fountain ready,

33:46.892 --> 33:49.059
so we can do a louche
for this dude.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.361
This guy's a real
absinthe aficionado.

33:51.897 --> 33:52.796
Let's hurry up, man,

33:52.865 --> 33:54.831
we don't even know
where we at over here.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.234
We don't wanna be
doing this at the site.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.804
We're gonna
fill this up with ice.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.205
<i>  We're gonna try this out</i>
<i>  and see how it works.</i>

34:02.207 --> 34:03.874
I'm anxious to
get this drink in his hand

34:03.876 --> 34:05.275
and hear his response from it.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.911
Three to one,
water to absinthe ratio.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.380
This is what does our louche.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.082
Just a little drip
like that...

34:12.117 --> 34:13.083
Is all it takes

34:13.085 --> 34:14.985
to release the flavors
and the oils

34:14.987 --> 34:16.987
and the botanicals from state.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.655
He doesn't know that
we did this for him,

34:18.657 --> 34:19.956
it's just something that
we wanted to do

34:19.958 --> 34:22.726
to make sure that we give
a customer the right thing.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.561
And these things
can get quite expensive.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.229
I mean, you can go buy one for

34:26.231 --> 34:28.565
$300-$400 out of the store.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.767
Or you can contact us
for 19.95,

34:30.769 --> 34:33.003
-you can have this one
right here.
-Plus shipping and handling.

34:33.005 --> 34:35.205
-Come on, let's go.
-We oughta get in the business
of making these things.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.741
Hey, man, you think I ain't
been thinking about it?

34:37.743 --> 34:39.209
We make it seem like
this is fun and games,

34:39.211 --> 34:40.977
but we are really going
to sell some alcohol

34:40.979 --> 34:43.180
<i>  to someone that</i>
<i>  we really don't know.</i>

34:43.182 --> 34:46.049
<i>  Selling alcohol to anyone,</i>
<i>  you can go to jail.</i>

34:46.051 --> 34:47.150
I mean...

34:47.152 --> 34:48.085
I'm a big little dude,

34:48.087 --> 34:49.786
but they'll call me
strawberry in jail.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.254
I don't want to go to jail.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.322
[richard] let's
set this thing up, man,

34:52.324 --> 34:53.790
and get outta here.
I don't like it.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.891
<i>  Yeah, this ain't the bayou,</i>

34:54.893 --> 34:55.725
this is a different
kind of jungle.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.127
This is a concrete jungle
here.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.563
-Let's bring it in.
-[craig] I think, that's him
right there, man.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.498
[richard] oh, yeah,
that's him. There he go.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.371
[suspenseful music playing]

35:11.076 --> 35:11.942
who's richard?

35:11.977 --> 35:13.043
Whoa!

35:20.018 --> 35:21.651
[richard] so you're the one
wanting the absinthe?

35:21.653 --> 35:23.120
[buyer]
yeah, I want that absinthe.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.122
Yeah, james said you like
this absinthe stuff.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.056
Yes, sir.

35:26.058 --> 35:28.125
Look, we put a fountain
together for you.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.226
We're gonna just show you
what this thing does.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.094
Do a proper louche,
you know.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.596
Look how beautiful that is.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.997
[buyer] that's nice,
yeah, it's pretty.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.299
[richard] it's looking like it
should be in new orleans.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.135
Now, that's a proper drink
right here, man.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.269
And it tastes...

35:40.072 --> 35:41.838
Just as good as it looks.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.241
I'll take the first sip
and show you we're real.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.042
As this guy takes his sip,

35:46.044 --> 35:46.943
I'm thinking about
all the work

35:46.945 --> 35:48.044
we put in into this drink.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.113
I mean a whole lot of
time and money.

35:54.019 --> 35:54.784
<i> [narrator] coming up...</i>

35:54.786 --> 35:58.088
[digger] it's about 95 proof.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.891
Is there any chance at all
you'd let us set up here

36:00.893 --> 36:02.025
for an extended period?

36:02.027 --> 36:04.561
That's a...
That's a big question.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.939
[john] well, this is our
wall of fame.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.909
A lot of unique bottles that
we've done over the years.

36:18.911 --> 36:21.778
John, has this
big nice showcase

36:21.780 --> 36:23.013
full of assorted bottles

36:23.015 --> 36:24.948
and they simply
all contain water.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.117
[john] these are
swarovski crystals.

36:27.119 --> 36:30.954
Uh, this one's sold anywhere
from $75 to $125.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.355
Dang.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.058
At one time, it was the most
expensive bottle of water
in the world.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.760
Wonder if we'd put us
some shiny trinkets

36:36.762 --> 36:37.827
on a mason jar,

36:37.829 --> 36:39.829
<i>  you put premium liquor in it,</i>

36:39.831 --> 36:41.364
hell, there's no telling
what it would be.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.098
That's insane.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.034
[john laughs]

36:45.904 --> 36:48.104
[richard]
I'll take the first sip
and show you we're real.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.106
[buyer] oh, yeah,
it smells right.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.108
[richard]
<i>  as this guy takes his sip,</i>

36:52.110 --> 36:53.076
<i>  I'm thinking about</i>
<i>  all the work</i>

36:53.078 --> 36:53.944
we've put in into this drink.

36:53.946 --> 36:56.012
I mean, a whole lot of
time and money.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.815
<i>  And it all comes down to</i>
<i>  whether or not our absinthe</i>

36:58.817 --> 37:01.151
tastes like the stuff that
he's used to drinking.

37:01.153 --> 37:03.720
That's what it smells like
back in the day?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.456
Oh, yeah, and it tastes good.
Tastes just like it, man.

37:09.161 --> 37:11.194
-Oh, yeah, yeah, this is it.
-That's it.

37:11.196 --> 37:14.231
[buyer] we had this way back
in the '60s and '70s, man.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.799
Our family used to drink this.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.300
-[richard] really?
-Yeah, yeah.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.069
[richard] I'm glad
you like it, my man.

37:19.071 --> 37:21.371
[craig] it's gonna be $250.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.906
Okay, you take crypto?

37:22.908 --> 37:23.940
Crypto, yeah.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.309
[richard] oh, yeah,
we definitely take crypto.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.111
[buyer] okay, that's what
I'm talking about.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.079
There you go.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.780
By the time we get back
to the bayou,

37:30.782 --> 37:32.649
this crypto better be
going up in value.

37:32.651 --> 37:33.950
If not, I can promise you,

37:33.952 --> 37:35.652
craig is gonna be working
some overtime.

37:35.654 --> 37:36.820
How much more of this
can I get?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.555
'cause a lot of people are
gonna ask for it.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.056
[richard] well, we can make
as much as you need.

37:40.058 --> 37:43.159
Oh, man, you gonna make
a lot of people happy.

37:43.161 --> 37:46.096
This guy wants as much
absinthe as we can make.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.131
And for $250 a gallon,

37:48.133 --> 37:50.100
I'll make as much as
he can take.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.636
We'll get right on it
as soon as get back home.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.404
I appreciate it.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.972
-See y'all later.
Get home safe, bye-bye.
-All right, thanks, my man.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.073
<i> [richard] we're in</i>
<i>  the big leagues now.</i>

37:57.075 --> 37:58.642
I mean, we gotta get back
to the still site

37:58.644 --> 38:00.744
and figure out how to
upscale this recipe.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.912
[craig] so excited,
I'm dropping the keys, man.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.215
Yeah, man, but we can't take
our time out here tonight.

38:05.217 --> 38:07.284
That's when you go to jail
right now.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.319
I got scared.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.121
[craig] yeah.

38:11.123 --> 38:14.257
Let's hit the highway
with this money.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.301
<i> [mark] damn, there goes</i>
<i>  them butterflies,</i>

38:24.303 --> 38:26.169
<i>  flipping and flopping</i>
<i>  in my belly again.</i>

Them bubble guts.

God almighty.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.142
<i> [digger] I gave john a call,</i>
<i>  he's gonna come on over.</i>

38:32.144 --> 38:35.278

I'm not uneasy at this point.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.212
Hi, mark, hey, digger.

38:36.214 --> 38:37.947
-[mark] hey, johnny.
-[digger] hello, john.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.016
<i>  I gotta break</i>
<i>  the question to him.</i>

38:40.018 --> 38:42.886
"can we stay here
and run on for a while?"

38:42.888 --> 38:44.954
this right here,
made on your water,

38:44.956 --> 38:47.657
tempered on your water,

38:47.659 --> 38:50.760
I don't think you can get much
prettier and clear than that.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.195
-[john] no.
-You can tell that
it was a lonely man

38:52.197 --> 38:53.596
who tightened that lid up.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.198
[all laughing]

38:55.200 --> 38:58.935
-strong hands.
-I'll tell ya, it's, uh...
I'm proud of it.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.036
[digger] it's about...

39:00.839 --> 39:02.939
95 proof.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.240
[john] that's just right.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.142
That's smooth.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.144
That'd get you hurt
in a hurry.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.879
That's like a good marriage.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.214
It'll put you on
your knees quick.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.248
[mark laughs]

39:12.250 --> 39:14.084
[john] guys, I'll tell you,
I just...

39:14.553 --> 39:16.019
I've had some moonshine,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.021
I've never tasted anything
that's like this.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.756
[mark] this water's so cold

39:19.758 --> 39:20.757
and that's the secret.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.692
When you're condensing it,

39:22.694 --> 39:24.994
the colder you can keep it

39:24.996 --> 39:25.995
-the less fire--
-get back the vapor

39:25.997 --> 39:28.064
as efficiently as possible.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.201
...That it gets into
the taste, the finish of it.

39:31.203 --> 39:33.770
You know, that's your water.
That's...

39:33.772 --> 39:35.572
-And I had no doubt...
-Wow.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.973
...That it would do that.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.942
Is there any chance at all
you'd let us

39:38.944 --> 39:41.111
set up here for
an extended period

39:41.113 --> 39:42.779
to make a little liquor?

39:42.781 --> 39:43.980
[whistles]

39:45.016 --> 39:47.150
that's a...
That's a big question.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.989
Well, guys, you know,
I mean, it's...

39:52.991 --> 39:56.092
As much as I like it, and
as much as I like the product,

39:56.294 --> 39:57.494
you know, we run a...

39:57.929 --> 39:59.396
A very legal business,

39:59.398 --> 40:01.698
and you all run
a very illegal business,

40:01.700 --> 40:03.566
and I just...

40:03.568 --> 40:05.301
For right now,
under those pretense,

40:05.303 --> 40:06.569
I just don't see
the two mixing.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.939
I feel in our heart of hearts,

40:09.941 --> 40:12.876
that was the answer that
we knew we would get.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.577
We've never ever

40:14.579 --> 40:16.646
been in a more perfect spot,

40:16.648 --> 40:17.847
but...

40:17.849 --> 40:20.049
We understand
your situation as well.

40:20.886 --> 40:21.885
You know, I'm feel like

40:22.154 --> 40:24.387
I've been slapped away
from a table for farting

40:24.956 --> 40:25.522
and...

40:25.957 --> 40:27.090
But it's...

40:27.092 --> 40:29.292
Also, it's not a surprise.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.760
Let me ask you something.

40:30.762 --> 40:31.861
Yes, sir.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.396
Have you ever thought about...

40:34.166 --> 40:37.367
Would you consider
going into a partnership?

40:38.270 --> 40:39.702
You don't have
to answer me now.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.771
I mean, it may not be
something y'all consider,

40:41.773 --> 40:43.873
but I've always wondered
about our water,

40:43.875 --> 40:45.442
you've proved it now.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.445
I'm just
throwing it out there.

40:48.447 --> 40:51.014
I mean, that's the first thing
that hit my mind,

40:51.016 --> 40:52.081
you know.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.483
That's awful attractive.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.118
<i>  He thinks that</i>

40:55.120 --> 40:59.055
<i>  he and I and mark need</i>
<i>  to form a partnership</i>

40:59.057 --> 41:00.924
and build a legal distillery

41:00.926 --> 41:03.026
from the ground up here
on this spring.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.060
You know, I don't even know

41:04.062 --> 41:06.930
what it would take
to build a distillery.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.898
This is a golden opportunity.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.266
<i>  But this is not just</i>

41:10.268 --> 41:11.201
<i>  selling recipes</i>

41:11.203 --> 41:15.238
and putting your face
and name on a jar.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.174
I don't know. That's--
I've never been

41:18.176 --> 41:20.977
presented with that
before in my life ever.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.946
<i> [digger] it's gonna be</i>
<i>  a big endeavor.</i>

41:22.948 --> 41:25.081
But it ain't everybody
that gets to make liquor

41:25.083 --> 41:27.183
on a spring
that's this quality

41:27.185 --> 41:28.351
<i>  and this size.</i>
