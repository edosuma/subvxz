<i>STAR: Far, far away</i>
<i>in a magical land called Mewni,</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.949
<i>lived a princess--</i>

00:50.951 --> 00:53.118
Star Butterfly.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.286
I'm fine!

00:55.789 --> 00:57.556
<i>Some people</i>
<i>have called me reckless</i>

00:57.558 --> 01:00.025
<i>and irresponsible</i>
<i>just because...</i>

01:00.027 --> 01:01.126
( growls )

01:01.128 --> 01:03.095
<i>I fight monsters</i>

01:03.097 --> 01:04.329
<i>and tame wild unicorns...</i>

01:04.331 --> 01:06.632
Yee-ha!

01:06.634 --> 01:08.033
<i>I like to have fun.</i>

01:08.035 --> 01:09.835
<i>And I'm about to have</i>
<i>a whole lot more</i>

01:09.837 --> 01:12.171
<i>because today</i>
<i>is my 14th birthday!</i>

01:12.173 --> 01:14.673
<i>And according to tradition,</i>
<i>my mom, the Queen,</i>

01:14.675 --> 01:18.911
<i>has to bestow upon me</i>
<i>our greatest family heirloom--</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:22.081
The Royal Magic Wand!

01:24.250 --> 01:25.350
( hoof beats approach )

01:26.286 --> 01:27.619
( all screaming )

01:30.590 --> 01:32.257
( panting )

01:33.593 --> 01:34.893
Now, Star.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.129
This wand
is a big responsibility.

01:37.131 --> 01:40.265
Yeah!
If it falls
into the hands of Evil Forces,

01:40.267 --> 01:42.367
the universe
could be destroyed!

01:42.369 --> 01:43.335
Aha-ha-ha-ha!

01:48.074 --> 01:50.309
Don't worry, Mom,
I can handle it.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.644
( screaming )

01:56.349 --> 01:58.350
BOTH:
She can't handle it.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.086
No! (sobbing )

02:01.088 --> 02:03.322
I can be good!
Please!

02:03.324 --> 02:05.157
Don't send me
to Saint Olga's Reform School

02:05.159 --> 02:07.759
for Wayward Princesses!

02:08.695 --> 02:10.796
Aaaaahhh!!!

02:10.798 --> 02:14.199
Sweetheart, we're not
sending you there.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.301
Oh!
<i>Yet.</i>

02:16.303 --> 02:19.638
We're sending you to train
in a safer dimension,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.207
a place called Earth.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.275
Earth?

02:23.277 --> 02:26.378
Manfred, open the portal.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.322
( sighs )
Goodbye, Mewni.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.326
( evil laughter )

02:44.430 --> 02:46.265
( roars )

02:46.267 --> 02:50.369
So you say you're from
another dimension.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.942
And you said
there was no magic on Earth.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.011
Yeah....

02:59.013 --> 03:00.812
This isn't
gonna work.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.881
( cash register dings )

03:02.883 --> 03:05.751
She is gonna
love it here!

03:08.354 --> 03:11.089
She's going to need a guide.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.059
<i>MAN: (on PA) Marco Diaz</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

03:14.061 --> 03:17.162
<i>Marco Diaz to</i>
<i>the principal's office.</i>

03:17.164 --> 03:21.200
Ooh, looks like
someone's in trouble.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.937
So I guess everyone
who voted me Safest Kid

03:24.939 --> 03:26.405
must be feeling

03:26.407 --> 03:29.441
pretty embarrassed
right about now.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.709
Do I need a hall pass?

03:30.711 --> 03:33.111
Would you
just go already?!

03:35.281 --> 03:36.949
Marco!

03:36.951 --> 03:40.052
I want you to meet our new
foreign exchange student

03:40.054 --> 03:42.321
Star Butterfly!

03:42.323 --> 03:44.423
( gasps, growls )

03:44.425 --> 03:48.727
Huh?
I need a responsible
never-take-chances type

03:48.729 --> 03:49.728
to keep an eye on her,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.930
and who better than you?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.332
The safe kid!

03:53.334 --> 03:56.935
What?! No, no, no,
I'm completely wrong for this.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.770
I'm a misunderstood
bad boy!

03:58.772 --> 04:00.806
You're adorable!

04:00.808 --> 04:02.474
Now I'm off
to the ice cream shop.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.010
Daddy's getting all 52 flavors!

04:05.012 --> 04:06.178
Huh.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.180
( growling )

04:10.416 --> 04:12.284
Thanks for showing
me around, safe kid.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.952
What? No.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.954
Whatever you heard
about me isn't true.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.322
Hi!

04:17.324 --> 04:20.792
I don't know where people
get the idea I'm so safe!

04:20.794 --> 04:22.761
Oh, watch your step.
Loose tile.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.829
It's ridiculous!

04:23.831 --> 04:25.264
Careful.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.332
You wear a helmet
in the gym shower one time

04:27.334 --> 04:28.433
and you're
labeled for life.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.968
Oh, broken glass.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.437
Frankly,
I like taking risks

04:32.439 --> 04:34.940
and would welcome
a little danger in my life...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.342
( screeches )

04:38.278 --> 04:40.012
( screams )

04:40.014 --> 04:41.280
What the heck was that?!

04:41.282 --> 04:42.948
Oops...

04:42.950 --> 04:45.384
I thought you wanted
a little danger.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.421
Who  <i>are </i> you?

04:49.423 --> 04:52.291
(sing-songy)
I'm a magical princess

04:52.293 --> 04:54.526
from another dimension.

04:55.561 --> 04:56.862
( creatures screaming )

04:58.998 --> 05:01.933
Well, that brings us
to the end of our tour.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.635
I'm going home now.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.203
Bye, new friend!

05:05.205 --> 05:06.405
See you tomorrow.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.339
Bye!

05:07.341 --> 05:08.373
Bye, new friend!

05:08.375 --> 05:10.075
See you later!

05:12.945 --> 05:14.446
( laughter )

05:16.382 --> 05:19.351
Oh, Marco! Come meet the new
foreign exchange student

05:19.353 --> 05:20.819
who's gonna be
living with us!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.254
Wha.. Wha..

05:22.256 --> 05:23.388
What?!

05:23.390 --> 05:25.324
I had no idea
these were your parents!

05:25.326 --> 05:26.992
I just assumed
everyone on Earth

05:26.994 --> 05:28.360
had the last name Diaz!

05:28.362 --> 05:30.228
Won't it be nice
to have Star's upbeat,

05:30.230 --> 05:33.198
lively energy
around the house?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.467
We could have gotten that
from a litter of puppies.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.171
I love puppies!!!

05:40.206 --> 05:41.373
( yipping )

05:41.375 --> 05:43.175
BOTH: Aww...

05:49.115 --> 05:50.382
Oh. Eh...

05:51.517 --> 05:54.453
Well, they are really cute.
Ha ha ha ha!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.355
Ay! My eye!
Ha ha ha ha!

05:56.357 --> 05:59.024
Marco, why don't you
show Star her new room?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.292
Yay!

06:03.896 --> 06:05.430
( evil laughter )

06:15.108 --> 06:16.308
( croaks )

06:16.310 --> 06:17.642
Ludo, Master.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.412
I've tracked down
Star Butterfly.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.347
They've hidden her
in the Earth dimension,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.015
unguarded.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.884
( evil laughter )

06:28.388 --> 06:31.423
Excellent work,
Buff Frog.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.492
I knew they couldn't hide
that royal brat

06:33.494 --> 06:35.093
from me for long.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.396
So the wand will be mine.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.131
And then the universe.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.899
And then...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.501
Actually, the universe
should do it.

06:43.436 --> 06:47.906
I'm coming for you,
Princess Butterfly.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.541
Here's your new room.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.543
Ow!

06:51.545 --> 06:53.145
O-kay.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.147
I can
work with this.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.151
Sparkle
Glitter Bomb Expand!

07:07.160 --> 07:08.393
Whoa.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.395
Ah, that's better.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.431
I wish I had a room like this.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.499
You do?

07:14.501 --> 07:15.634
Huh?

07:16.669 --> 07:19.971
Mystic Room Suck Transform!

07:22.175 --> 07:23.308
( screaming )

07:26.212 --> 07:28.079
Suck? Suck?!

07:28.081 --> 07:30.382
Why was the word "suck"
in that spell?

07:30.384 --> 07:32.451
I don't know.
It just came out that way.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.985
( groans )

07:33.987 --> 07:36.655
I'm sorry, Marco. Uh...

07:36.657 --> 07:39.558
How about a little sunshine
to brighten your day?

07:41.327 --> 07:44.329
( thunder rumbles )
Ohh...

07:44.331 --> 07:46.097
I can't
take this anymore!

07:46.099 --> 07:48.500
If you're moving in,
I am moving out!

07:49.435 --> 07:50.635
Uhh!

07:50.637 --> 07:53.205
Are you okay?

07:53.207 --> 07:55.173
Luckily the cactuses
broke my fall.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.108
Do you need any help?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.243
Ow!

07:58.245 --> 07:59.244
I'm fine!

07:59.246 --> 08:01.480
Just leave me alone!

08:02.548 --> 08:04.249
Uh. Ohh.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.384
Ahh. Hmm.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.986
Ahh. Uhh.

08:10.089 --> 08:11.122
Huhh.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.325
Here he comes,
here he comes.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.094
Hey, brother, do me a solid.
Refill this for me!

08:16.096 --> 08:19.698
They won't let me back inside
because I'm soggy!

08:19.700 --> 08:21.099
Did you bring me my refill?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.534
Don't make eye contact.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.338
If you come to my house,
you bring toilet paper!

08:26.340 --> 08:27.606
Whoa!
Whoa!

08:27.608 --> 08:29.040
What are you
doing here?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.714
I didn't get a choice
about coming here to Earth,

08:35.716 --> 08:37.516
and you didn't get a choice

08:37.518 --> 08:39.451
about having to deal with me.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.487
I'll...

08:42.489 --> 08:45.123
I'll find another family
to live with.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.160
S-- St-- Star.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.428
( growling )

08:50.430 --> 08:51.763
Star Butterfly!

08:51.765 --> 08:54.232
At last I've found you!

08:54.234 --> 08:55.400
Ludo!

08:55.402 --> 08:57.402
How did you know I was here?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.471
( chuckle )
Wouldn't you like to know?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.506
Yes, that's why I asked.

09:01.508 --> 09:05.377
Hey, I don't have to tell you
anything!

09:05.379 --> 09:07.412
Get her!
( roaring )

09:09.515 --> 09:11.349
Hi-ya!

09:11.351 --> 09:13.685
( laughing)
You can fight?

09:13.687 --> 09:16.087
It's called karate.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.525
Karate!

09:21.460 --> 09:23.461
You said
she was unguarded.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.729
I don't know.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.566
Hi-ya!
Huh?

09:29.335 --> 09:30.468
Whoo-hoo!

09:30.470 --> 09:32.704
Rainbow Fist Punch!

09:34.774 --> 09:36.207
( growls )

09:37.510 --> 09:38.777
Haa!
( horse neighing )

09:42.248 --> 09:43.481
You're embarrassing me.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.516
Get up!

09:44.518 --> 09:46.151
( growls )

09:46.153 --> 09:49.087
Jelly Bean
Hallucination Mist!

09:49.089 --> 09:50.455
Whoa.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.724
What is happening?

09:55.461 --> 09:56.828
Hi-ya!

09:56.830 --> 10:00.231
Mega Narwhal Blast!

10:00.233 --> 10:05.503
( groaning )

10:08.774 --> 10:11.710
STAR: You want some of this,
Ludo?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.812
No.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.513
You see, you morons?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.550
This is what happens
when you don't work out.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.552
Your muscles are like pudding.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.820
Come on.
Back in the portal.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.189
Back in
the portal.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.591
You even
retreat like losers.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.529
I'll get you,
Star Butterf--

10:33.332 --> 10:34.532
That was amazing.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.167
I was amazing.
You were amazing.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.536
Yeah, I guess we were.

10:39.739 --> 10:44.309
Well, I should probably go...
pack my bags.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.244
Wait.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.512
I don't want you to go.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.481
I want you to stay with us.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.615
Really?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.450
Hugs!

10:55.187 --> 10:57.656
Are there going to be monsters
attacking us all the time?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.391
Yeah, probably.

10:59.393 --> 11:00.892
All right!

11:00.894 --> 11:03.461
Sounds so dangerous.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.263
Whoa.
Let's cross at the light.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.931
Okay, wild man.

11:06.933 --> 11:12.404

11:46.406 --> 11:49.407
Are you ready to make
some bad choices?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.608
Let me just wake up Marco.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.610
Oh, that is
not a dead person?

11:52.612 --> 11:55.480
Not dead. Ohh...

11:55.482 --> 11:58.416
Pony Head, meet my
best friend Marco Diaz.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.452
Your  <i>best </i> friend?

12:00.454 --> 12:03.722
Huh? Oh-- no, no, no.
On Earth.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.357
You're  my best friend
on Mewni.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.993
Marco, this is the Pony
I've been telling you about.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.465
I hate your face.
Plus, you're ugly.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.000
(laughing) Just kidding.
That's a joke.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.535
Tick-tock girl,

12:17.537 --> 12:19.370
let's par-tay.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.674
Yeah, Marco,
let's par-tay.

12:22.676 --> 12:23.842
With her?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.977
Um, okay, well, I was gonna--

12:25.979 --> 12:27.545
but I mean--I was gonna--

12:27.547 --> 12:29.013
I--uh-- all right.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.952
My two besties

12:33.954 --> 12:35.553
Sweet. Let's go.

STAR: Dimensional scissors!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.260
Ah! Jealous.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.728
Wait, we're going
to another dimension--

12:43.730 --> 12:44.863
Come on!

12:52.371 --> 12:54.706
(bites)
Glitter.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.508
She was here.

12:59.411 --> 13:00.478
Ahh!

13:00.480 --> 13:01.880
Huh?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.015
( party music playing )

13:05.885 --> 13:07.385
Where are we?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.320
STAR: The Bounce Lounge.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.557
My favorite
place to chill.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.958
Just stay away
from the edge.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.527
Huh?
Ahh!

13:18.597 --> 13:20.532
Marco, photo booth.
Photo booth.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.833
Come on!

13:25.404 --> 13:26.671
STAR: Yeah!

13:28.941 --> 13:31.376
Whoo! Now just you two.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.913
A souvenir from the night
my besties became besties.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.447
Yay.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.318
Listen, we are not
gonna be besties.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.487
We're not even
gonna be second-besties.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.556
Second-besties?

13:44.558 --> 13:46.090
That's not even a thing.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.626
Oh, you want to
make this a thing?

13:49.695 --> 13:51.462
Look here, Earth Turd,

13:51.464 --> 13:53.798
this night is really
important to me.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.634
You mess that up,
and you're gonna get the horn.

13:57.803 --> 14:00.572
Got it? Good.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.840
Real good.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.041
Later!

14:08.414 --> 14:10.515
Wow-whoo! Look at this!

14:10.517 --> 14:14.085
Psst. Star, I need to
talk to yooooo...

14:15.487 --> 14:16.888
Star, Pony Head
threatened to--

14:18.691 --> 14:20.625
( screams )

14:20.627 --> 14:23.628
Fall, fall, fall, fall...

14:23.630 --> 14:25.697
Marco, be careful.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.932
Pony Head just tried to
shove me off this cloud!

14:27.934 --> 14:30.401
Oh, no,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.471
she just gets a little wild
when she dances.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
Oh, yes!

14:34.875 --> 14:36.007
Oh, you like that.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.408
You know you do.
You love it.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.143
Well, she also
threatened to skewer me

14:39.145 --> 14:40.545
in the photo booth.

14:42.481 --> 14:46.551
Yeah...
she can be possessive.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.153
Pony Head, let's go to
the Amethyst Arcade.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.622
Marco will have
more fun there.

14:50.624 --> 14:51.956
No way, girl.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.392
I'm getting my dance on.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.161
( gasps )

14:57.163 --> 14:58.529
Yes, you are right, Star.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.697
He will like
the arcade better.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.466
Let's go!

15:01.468 --> 15:03.835
(sing-songy)
She's warming up to you.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.707
Holy pixels.

15:09.709 --> 15:13.478
So many videogames!

15:13.480 --> 15:15.446
Yes, I knew
you would like it here.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.015
This place is
full of squares.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.050
( groaning )

15:19.052 --> 15:21.119
Look.
Lance Lance Revolution.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.921
That's perfect.
You guys, go play.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.098
MARCO: Hi-ya.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.569
You're going down,
Downer.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.939
Oh, yeah?
Well, your mother's a horse.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.475
Ah, okay,
and your point would be?

15:44.477 --> 15:47.045
Aw, look at you two
getting along.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.546
Eww.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.448
Oh, I'll go get us
some nice cold icicles

15:50.450 --> 15:52.517
to put on your disgusting,
sweaty back.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.954
Hey, you, Square.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.589
Have you seen this head?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.525
Don't lie to me,

Who's the turd now?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.534
Still you.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.035
I think I'm next.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.471
But with less abusive
trash talk, please.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.208
Um, let's see,
do I want the pointy one
or the pointier one?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.209
Oh, it's such a tough choice.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.644
Hey, Star, I'm bored.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.814
Uh, I know this other club.
So let's bounce.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.248
Sounds cool.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.750
I'll go get Marco.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.785
Oh, no, no, no, no,
he went on ahead.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.955
Um, yes, he wanted to save us
a good spot in the mosh pit.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.790
Yes, that is
the course of events.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.959

16:44.604 --> 16:46.871
Try and beat that,
Pointy Head.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.140
Star?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.575
Pointy Head?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.510
( heavy breathing )

16:52.512 --> 16:54.078
( girls laughing )

16:55.514 --> 16:58.182
Is this not a blast
or what, B-Fly?

16:58.184 --> 17:01.352
Yeah-heah! But I don't see
Marco anywhere.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.621
Pfft.
You got me, girl.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.223
And I'm way more fun.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.658
Uh, what are you talking about?

17:07.660 --> 17:10.228
Uh, funny story,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.096
you're gonna love it.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.931
I kind of ditched him and left
him in the other dimension.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.999
Oops.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.768
What?!
( screams )

17:16.770 --> 17:18.169
B-Fly!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.937
How could you do that
to my best friend?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.539
Best friend?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.541
Last time I checked,
the best friend was me.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.843
I can have two best friends.

17:25.845 --> 17:29.647
Unless one of them
is a friend-ditching liar.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.317
That Earth Turd means
that much to you?

17:34.553 --> 17:37.255
He's the best turd
I've ever known.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.091
Okay.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.760
MYSTERIOUS FIGURE:
For the last time,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.595
where is she?!

17:44.597 --> 17:47.098
I'm telling you,
I don't know!

17:47.100 --> 17:48.833
Not talking, eh?

17:48.835 --> 17:51.302
What if I do...this?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.004
Stop!

17:53.006 --> 17:55.173
That's  <i>really </i> annoying.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.309
There he is.

Crystal Dagger--

18:01.915 --> 18:03.648
Wait, B-Fly!

18:03.650 --> 18:05.950
It's too dangerous,
girl.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.251
Hold out your hand.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.655
Your dimensional scissors?

18:10.657 --> 18:13.624
I won't need them
where I am going.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.625
But, Pony Head--

18:14.627 --> 18:16.294
Oh, hey, creeps,

18:16.296 --> 18:19.163
I heard you're looking
to ride with a pony.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.299
So come and get me.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.733
( growling )

18:22.735 --> 18:24.368

18:26.338 --> 18:30.007
Wow!
Out of the way, Squares!

18:31.977 --> 18:34.912

18:34.914 --> 18:36.214
ALL: Yay!

18:40.018 --> 18:41.119
Stand back, Marco.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.087
No, it's okay.
My hand is free--

18:44.123 --> 18:46.724
Shiny Emerald Snake Strike!

18:49.661 --> 18:50.828
Bleech.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.263
Marco,
stop playing around.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.907
PONY HEAD: Okay!

19:05.010 --> 19:07.378
Whoo-hoo!
I feel so  <i>alive.</i>

19:07.380 --> 19:08.813

ALL: Huh?  Run!

19:25.697 --> 19:27.331
Back off, creeps.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.766
Don't worry, Pony Head,

19:28.768 --> 19:31.302
we've got your back--

19:34.673 --> 19:37.108
<i>KING PONY HEAD:</i>
<i>Time to give it up, Cupcake.</i>

19:37.110 --> 19:39.677

19:41.079 --> 19:42.780

19:44.283 --> 19:46.384
Hello, Daddy.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.286
Hello, Princess.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.221
What is he doing here?

19:50.223 --> 19:51.923
Oh, B-Fly,

19:51.925 --> 19:54.225
it's the end
of the line for me.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.426
But at least I got in

19:55.428 --> 19:57.261
one last night of fun
with you, girl.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.362
One last night?

19:58.364 --> 20:00.831
Before what?

20:00.833 --> 20:04.468
Before this:
I'm going to St. O's!

20:04.470 --> 20:08.806
Not St. Olga's Reform School
For Wayward Princesses?!

20:09.775 --> 20:11.742

20:12.878 --> 20:15.379
Oh, it's true.
I did it to myself.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.215
I'm headed to the slammer.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.384
It's reform school,
Cupcake, not jail.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.353
Although admittedly
it is a lot like jail.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.922
Oh, Pony Head,

20:24.924 --> 20:26.857
you knew you'd get
sent to St. Olga's,

20:26.859 --> 20:29.260
but you still came back
to save Marco.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.729
Ah, well, you know,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.497
it's hard to say it,
but he is your other bestie.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.765
Okay, I said it.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.235
Aww, come here.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.422
