00:57.641 --> 01:00.759
I will begin with the preparation of the autopsy.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.377
It's always the same thing, and each time turns my stomach to.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.584
Please tell me that you have found traces.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.369
No, we have nothing.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.414
There is still no evidence of rape.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.800
This is true for each of the bodies.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.336
Why else would he let her dogs subsequently prepare so? - No.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.440
No dogs. Wolves. - You're welcome!

02:31.109 --> 02:34.551
Stop it! Bad enough that just under a full moon

02:34.571 --> 02:36.733
the girls bodies emerge.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.527
So there was another victim, last month.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.227
Outside of Woodville.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.536
A sixteen were found at a junkyard.

02:47.793 --> 02:51.401
He wants to make us believe that the watchdogs have torn it.

02:51.421 --> 02:56.132
And that's what we tell the press. - This is now the sixth girl.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.118
Go finally to the public with it! - Fuck no!

03:00.138 --> 03:03.580
The press rhymes anything else along a Wolf Man or something.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.584
And I do not think he knows how close we are at his heels.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.311
But ja?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.632
We are at a guy off who leads a dog fight ring.

03:13.652 --> 03:17.817
This shit breed those damn critters, and we see the result here.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.610
I hope you're right.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.561
If I catch this son of a bitch, I'll cut off his balls.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.698
That I can tell you.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.555
Lauren! The food is getting cold!

03:45.142 --> 03:47.304
You are late.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.606
Damn it!

03:56.278 --> 03:58.315
Molly is here!

04:01.074 --> 04:04.238
Hello, Molly! - Oh, sorry, Mr Redd, I forget the always.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.407
She comes down the same.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.606
Have you already packed for the weekend? - Will do afterwards.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.165
Your father will pick you up at five. - Yes I know.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.827
So you carry abgeranzte jeans at school?

04:23.847 --> 04:29.559
So that's today. - Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! - Hey! Kiss goodbye!

04:32.105 --> 04:35.338
I have to wear a jacket and tie in school.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.648
My dear, you'll be glad that you do not see her ass under the miniskirt.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.276
Did you ask?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.728
What shall I say? I can not for Grandma,

04:49.748 --> 04:52.355
because I want to Sauf Party.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.539
Eric has invited you personally. - I know.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.504
And I told him, it is not.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.700
I do not understand why you can not go next weekend to her.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.162
This is a family tradition or something.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.766
That's just stupid. You must definitely find an excuse.

05:42.759 --> 05:48.847
Mabel! That I'm so sorry! - Albert, because of you I get even a heart attack.

05:49.808 --> 05:53.875
Serves you just right. You should complete the screen door.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.638
Has emerged the key, or not yet?

05:57.107 --> 06:00.350
It's middle of the day. - I could have been a burglar.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.278
Or what worse.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.473
The key is useless, he can not turn around.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.110
I bet the lock only needs oil.

06:11.621 --> 06:17.107
Now you've Clancy flustered. He is determined barking for hours.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.211
I give him no matter what to eat, then he keeps his mouth.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.628
That would not be necessary if Mr Patterson would take care of the animal.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.093
Why are you at this time with me?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.798
Well, you said that your granddaughter comes over.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.351
So I thought, I cook something nice for you ladies.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.672
That's very sweet of you.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.509
It's fine, right? I do not want to impose the yes.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.816
That's fine. That will be nice.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.315
And!

06:50.160 --> 06:52.117
Fabulous!

06:54.623 --> 06:57.814
Albert! You know I do not eat meat.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.793
That's for me and Lauren. - Who said no!

07:01.087 --> 07:03.329
She is a vegetarian, just like I am.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.324
I'm so sorry. I ... - I do not even want it in the house!

07:07.344 --> 07:11.213
Bring it out immediately! - OK. OK.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.164
Clancy will taste it.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.417
And in the meantime, you can look for the keys so times.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.180
My toolbox is in the car.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.234
Na, hast du Hunger?

07:31.785 --> 07:35.745
Sure you did. You have to wait a bit.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.694
Did you see how Eric has been staring you in the classroom?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.405
He is full of pissed off because you're not coming.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.158
That does not help me.

07:50.178 --> 07:54.263
Oh, man, I tell you! You will not believe who's here just purely crawled.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.416
I have it! - What?

07:58.436 --> 08:02.087
Tell your mom just that Jessica is visiting us.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.547
And we on Saturday night me what your business.

08:04.567 --> 08:09.437
That is perfect! This is a terrific excuse and an alibi for Eric's party.

08:17.247 --> 08:21.231
I guess, but Eric does not want lesbians in his house.

08:21.251 --> 08:25.694
Oh! A pity. - Eric invited us personally. Honest!

08:25.714 --> 08:29.674
Well, at any party's probably a couple of freaks.

08:39.602 --> 08:43.061
That should be enough. - Thank you, Albert.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.308
I will not close the door stupid anyway.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.736
Cathy, I can not. I'm sorry.

09:07.756 --> 09:11.614
Yesterday I made an extra bilayer because I already longer what intend.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.626
Mom?

09:15.263 --> 09:19.598
Ask Debra, okay? Well, beautiful. Good luck.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.459
Get your about packing.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.628
I have just learned that Jessica is there again at the weekend.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.507
Molly and I want on Saturday hanging out with her. - That's what you just heard?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.019
You know it only since just.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.266
I know how hard it was for you, as it is pulled away.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.560
But this weekend, we have kept all.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.647
But why does not the next weekend? Grandma has certainly nothing before.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.358
Not out of the question. - That's not fair!

09:47.378 --> 09:50.403
Life is not always fair! Friends are important.

09:50.423 --> 09:55.168
But the family comes first. Go and get ready!

10:13.279 --> 10:16.596
Look! In the dress I have not seen you for long.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.735
Mom says I should get dressed for the weekend like a lady. - Looks good.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.789
I look like a sucker. - Yes. But like a prettier.

10:28.378 --> 10:33.339
Jessica is in town for the weekend. I would like to see genuine.

10:34.175 --> 10:38.169
Could you possibly convince your wife of another appointment?

10:39.264 --> 10:44.134
You know that even I as you can not do anything. Belt, please!

11:21.431 --> 11:25.415
If Grandma agrees to postpone, then you drive me back home?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.292
Try it not even.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.753
But what if I stay only one night? I mean, I can not imagine,

11:30.773 --> 11:33.481
that you could not fit.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.557
I'll call you tomorrow sometime, when can you pick me up. - OK.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.536
I play from ten golf. So do not call me to one, yes?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.708
Stupid dog!

11:57.342 --> 12:03.464
Hi! You are determined Lauren. I'm Albert. A friend of your grandmother.

12:05.433 --> 12:10.752
From nursing home. - Oh! Yes! My mom told me about you.

12:10.772 --> 12:15.437
Mabel told me so much about you also. Nice to finally meet you.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.318
Come in! Come in!

12:21.407 --> 12:24.807
I recognized you directly because of the photos on the mantelpiece.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.570
You're prettier than I thought.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.824
Thank you. Where is Grandma?

12:32.126 --> 12:35.318
Just take a little nap. I cook us something nice.

12:35.338 --> 12:39.423
She has cleaned the whole day, and She has just lain down.

12:40.843 --> 12:48.164
You can wake you like. - It's okay. You should recover.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.679
Mabel wanted me to cook today special because you're here.

12:55.692 --> 12:59.276
Would Frankly they should let me help when brushing.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.564
Do you like Italian?

13:04.075 --> 13:08.184
I cook us afterwards my absolute specialty.

13:08.204 --> 13:13.620
Porcettu Ubriaca. Sounds fancy, but it's actually pretty easy.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.695
It's vegetarian, right? - What do you think of me, little one?

13:18.715 --> 13:21.364
Mabel has made clear to me unequivocally.

13:21.384 --> 13:25.243
But I'm an hors d'oeuvre with a bite of meat.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.051
If you want to try sometimes ...

13:28.766 --> 13:32.500
What's this? - Liver.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.513
Is Grandmas pan? - But of course.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.399
The uses the ever again. - Do not be silly, Lauren!

13:40.445 --> 13:44.470
I mean it really seriously. In my family there is an allergy to meat.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.265
I almost died when I was three.

13:47.285 --> 13:52.312
I did not know that that's the reason. That must be terrible indeed.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.326
I suffer from iron deficiency. I know something so well.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.164
Flesh is as the best. I need to eat meat.

14:02.425 --> 14:06.339
There are pills on the other hand. - The are not enough for me.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.555
That says my doctor.

14:11.434 --> 14:17.522
So old pans are not hard to get. I promise, I'll buy you a new one.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.822
I am so envious. You and Mabel, you have a girl's weekend just for you.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.726
Yes. Total cool, but my girlfriend is in town.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.187
I have not seen her for ages.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.200
I hope it's okay for them if I go tomorrow.

14:37.752 --> 14:41.486
Hey, Mabel understood but a teenage girl who wants to see her friend again times.

14:41.506 --> 14:45.671
I would wait until she has downed a glass of wine before I ask.

14:47.804 --> 14:52.219
Apropos, the sauce needs to simmer a little while.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.504
A little wine?

14:59.524 --> 15:01.732
But not too much.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.643
Even a little more than that. - You've got tasted wine before.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.575
Yes, ready.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.447
Do not exaggerate!

15:26.467 --> 15:30.757
Drunk you have wine before, but no wine like this.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.664
You must really enjoy it. Not only wegschlucken.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.802
I wanted not only wegschlucken him.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.769
First, you need to swing it. - I know that only by Brandy.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.768
Do you see? So.

15:46.863 --> 15:51.324
And now ... smelling its aroma!

15:53.578 --> 15:56.537
Take a small sip!

15:58.166 --> 16:00.704
Let him in the mouth!

16:03.087 --> 16:05.545
Gulp it down!

16:07.842 --> 16:12.428
That was really good. - Better than the ones you had before, right?

16:13.556 --> 16:16.720
Yes. - Nice that it tastes good.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.902
FULL MOON

16:45.755 --> 16:49.405
And I never feed again so a squirrel-cattle.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.133
Oh God! That was crazy.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.766
Want to get even a wine? - Schenk only!

17:09.237 --> 17:12.105
Sag mal, Lauren,

17:13.115 --> 17:18.736
such a beautiful young lady like you did but certainly a boyfriend.

17:19.539 --> 17:24.625
No! - Can I somehow can not imagine.

17:26.127 --> 17:30.168
Someone in mind? - There's someone.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.250
I thought so but.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.635
What's his name? - Eric. Eric Thompson.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.684
Is a hot guy, right? - Oh, God, yes!

17:43.479 --> 17:49.476
Have you kissed him? - No, but I'd like to.

17:50.820 --> 17:55.064
But you ever kissed a boy, right? - Sure, of course.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.858
And what else?

17:59.412 --> 18:02.405
A bit rumgefummelt perhaps?

18:06.335 --> 18:09.294
I'll tell even more.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.749
No I did not. Not that.

18:14.677 --> 18:19.620
But I've done another. - Just as I thought.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.757
I think it's good that you pick up.

18:22.059 --> 18:26.019
That's, that's something very valuable.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.816
Down with it! Time to wake Grandma.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.109
Would you like that I wake?

18:40.578 --> 18:44.162
Everything good, sweetie? You were drunk ever wine.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.502
Goes again. - Take me in any trouble.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.523
Grandma?

19:37.093 --> 19:38.584
Lauren?

19:41.847 --> 19:46.057
Lauren? Do not look!

19:49.313 --> 19:50.178
No!

19:51.440 --> 19:54.274
Here is Albert Fisk.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.311
702 York Street.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.694
An elderly woman has stumbled in the shower.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.280
Probably she's dead.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.207
No. She has no pulse.

20:11.168 --> 20:15.333
Yes, well. Send someone as soon as possible.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.124
Thank you.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.678
The ambulance service is on the way.

20:28.310 --> 20:33.851
I need to call my mom. - For this is later time.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.312
Are you cold?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.617
I'm terribly tired.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.620
Maybe you should lie down a bit, until the ambulance has arrived.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.718
That's better.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.644
So I liked it.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.820
Albert? - Yes? What?

22:07.493 --> 22:10.361
I think I'm getting sick.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.837
Crap!

22:24.426 --> 22:26.634
Everything OK with you?

22:38.607 --> 22:41.350
I would like to help you. - Not necessary!

22:56.917 --> 22:58.829
Lauren!

23:16.604 --> 23:19.813
I need help! Help!

24:36.225 --> 24:39.263
These are perhaps teeth, damn it!

24:40.521 --> 24:44.356
You've killed them. - Mabel was a very ...

24:46.735 --> 24:49.569
delicate old lady.

24:50.239 --> 24:53.403
What is it, Lauren? Do you feel as good?

24:54.243 --> 25:00.740
You've done what in the wine. - And you ... no idea.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.748
Come back to me! Into the bedroom.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.794
Then we can play together.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.093
Caught!

25:26.692 --> 25:30.276
Much better. Hey, I've got you like.

25:31.321 --> 25:36.441
I've stayed at many old ladies. One also had a granddaughter like you.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.613
She was so perfect.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.284
That she was ...

25:46.628 --> 25:48.540
undoing!

25:50.758 --> 25:53.216
You're not gay.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.671
That's what I can think already many stupid girl.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.607
Jungfrau blood tastes so sweet.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.777
I'm not a virgin.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.684
LÃ¼gnerin!

26:20.704 --> 26:24.813
Last summer I was with a boy. And we did it!

26:24.833 --> 26:27.576
I was afraid you could tell Grandma what.

26:29.171 --> 26:32.710
You whore! I'm going to enjoy it, to dismember you!

26:53.570 --> 26:56.313
You were lied to be kidding me.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.032
You are still a virgin.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.287
I can taste it.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.357
Help!

27:08.377 --> 27:12.371
Help! - Mr Patterson can not help you Lauren!

27:13.590 --> 27:16.253
He had a heart attack.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.138
Little Red Riding Hood!

27:31.775 --> 27:35.735
You're my sweet little red riding hood.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.684
You know, I'd really like to come down on you hard,

27:43.704 --> 27:46.242
before I thee aufschlitze throat!

27:46.707 --> 27:49.290
But I guess I'll ...

27:50.878 --> 27:53.461
wait until the food order.

29:00.322 --> 29:04.264
So, Margaret, thank you so much for this wonderful evening.

29:04.284 --> 29:08.699
Has been a pleasure. Now bring your sweet wife home safely. - I will.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.036
You have my key, right? - Yes.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.254
As always a gentleman.

29:38.819 --> 29:43.314
Lauren is doing well. She's my mother.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.584
Someone could come out and see us.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.257
And?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.332
She is dead.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.206
Albert?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.359
Help me.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.570
I am calling the police.

33:16.536 --> 33:20.621
No police. - You need help.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.788
That which thou hast done to me.

33:25.837 --> 33:31.208
You do not remember last night?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.381
What was there exactly?

33:35.347 --> 33:40.263
You have transformed yourself.

33:41.144 --> 33:45.295
And then you attacked me.

33:45.315 --> 33:48.103
This can not be.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.775
You have transformed yourself.

33:54.199 --> 33:57.613
In a monster.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.453
Can you about not remember?

34:05.794 --> 34:07.626
From...

34:09.630 --> 34:11.463
Albert?

34:32.821 --> 34:37.065
If it comes that you want to come home, think again about it!

34:40.829 --> 34:42.866
Lauren?

34:43.831 --> 34:46.245
What's wrong, what's wrong?

34:47.252 --> 34:52.088
It is what is really bad happened yesterday.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.793
What? What happened?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.507
Grandma is dead.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.725
It is probably slipped in the shower.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.765
And Albert is ...

35:08.356 --> 35:11.423
been attacked by something. 
- Albert?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.605
The from the retirement home was attacked?

35:14.696 --> 35:16.779
He's pretty badly injured.

35:17.073 --> 35:20.348
I think he's going to die. 
- Call the police immediately!

35:20.368 --> 35:23.202
He said that I should not.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.701
I have to leave here. Immediately.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.169
Stay there! Ll be right there.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.421
Who was that?

35:42.057 --> 35:45.550
My mother. She is a nurse.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.560
The wine.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.761
I need wine. - And why you need ...

35:57.781 --> 35:59.864
I do not know.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.031
I have so much pain.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.141
More.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.403
I did not do anything to you.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.412
Yes, you have.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.413
But you were not yourself.

36:54.504 --> 36:59.295
You were something else.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.298
Some...

37:05.640 --> 37:07.632
Fascinating.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.653
I am starving!

37:30.623 --> 37:33.491
Give flesh from yesterday!

37:43.011 --> 37:48.348
Should I warm up it for you? - No! Just ... Just bring her!

38:00.695 --> 38:04.179
You'll get real to ever remember anything? From last night?

38:04.199 --> 38:09.035
Only at short images. But unreal.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.583
Not even about food?

38:20.673 --> 38:23.507
Maybe it was just too much wine.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.712
I thought that can you take that.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.765
That's clear, I thought.

38:33.603 --> 38:38.394
In the bathroom, as you told me, Grandma was dead.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.655
Yes, it has ...

38:46.491 --> 38:49.529
have slipped and fallen really stupid.

38:50.703 --> 38:54.367
I saw it this morning.

38:54.666 --> 38:59.818
It looked as if she had something mangled.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.670
Like you.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.421
Was that me?

39:18.356 --> 39:20.769
How long does your mom here?

39:21.442 --> 39:23.729
Approximately 20 minutes.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.513
We, we ... we can make it look,

39:28.533 --> 39:31.526
as if the dog attacked us from outside.

39:32.662 --> 39:36.121
Why this, Albert? - Clancy.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.082
Let him in through the bathroom window!

39:43.256 --> 39:47.500
We can tell that he was already there when we found Mabel.

39:50.138 --> 39:54.330
He attacked you. He has bitten you in the hand.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.542
I want him tear them from you.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.646
But of course he went after me.

40:03.359 --> 40:09.572
Everything you need to do now is, let in him, through the window.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.576
Then hide yourself in the bedroom.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.155
Lauren,...

40:19.292 --> 40:23.377
it must learn not what you are.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.506
Not even your mom.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.180
Go.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.519
Go!

41:17.767 --> 41:20.555
What is it, Lauren? Do not you feel good?

41:31.572 --> 41:35.407
It was you. You attacked me yesterday!

41:36.411 --> 41:39.404
What are you talking about, dear? - You wanted to rape me!

41:41.165 --> 41:43.327
Do not do that, Lauren!

41:49.215 --> 41:52.128
Stop whining!

41:53.678 --> 41:56.170
I can not kill you with it.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.429
But you can not kill me also.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.599
By checking not you understand?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.186
You're a werewolf.

42:09.318 --> 42:12.218
And you've bitten me.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.571
So I am now also a.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.197
Lauren!

42:20.204 --> 42:25.074
When I saw your photo for the first time, I had ...

42:27.295 --> 42:31.487
a clue that,

42:31.507 --> 42:35.751
you befriedigst my deepest longings.

42:37.638 --> 42:42.679
I'm not a werewolf! And you not too. So what's not, Albert!

42:43.519 --> 42:46.227
I know what I saw. - You lie.

42:46.814 --> 42:50.808
You invent all these stories. - Look at me!

42:51.611 --> 42:54.479
What else should have done unto me so?

42:54.822 --> 42:58.848
The injuries you've caused me. And I only defended myself.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.642
All right! Believe what you want!

43:01.662 --> 43:06.314
Call the police! They will not believe me either.

43:06.334 --> 43:09.650
But if I see to it that they pump out the stomach you

43:09.670 --> 43:13.321
and in there are remains of me, and, from your grandmother

43:13.341 --> 43:16.550
so what? What would your mommy?

43:19.263 --> 43:23.164
I'll tell you how we do it.

43:23.184 --> 43:26.848
I will not betray you,

43:27.146 --> 43:29.670
and you will not betray me.

43:29.690 --> 43:35.561
And so that also works, you're going to bring the dog into the house here, now!

43:37.240 --> 43:39.857
And since you're at it, hide it well.

44:10.189 --> 44:13.057
Have you opened the window?

44:16.237 --> 44:20.151
I'm not a vampire. Idiot!

44:24.120 --> 44:26.453
That is silver.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.574
This works only in movies.

44:33.421 --> 44:36.129
Stay away from me!

44:36.340 --> 44:39.407
I slots for you! - You can not kill me!

44:39.427 --> 44:42.090
That's what you said yourself.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.838
But I can kill you with it.

45:14.795 --> 45:19.381
I would pray that I get through.

45:22.428 --> 45:25.466
Otherwise you'll charged with murder.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.326
Lauren, it's me!

46:00.091 --> 46:02.333
Mommy! - Baby, open the door!

46:03.344 --> 46:06.587
The key. - Is that Albert?

46:15.356 --> 46:18.315
Oh my goodness! Are you hurt?

46:21.737 --> 46:25.179
Are you all right? - I guess so, yeah. - OK.

46:25.199 --> 46:28.192
OK. Closing the door!

46:35.251 --> 46:37.618
That's silver, or?

46:38.587 --> 46:42.376
He just will not die. - She's crazy.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.632
They went after me. - He wanted to kill me.

46:49.390 --> 46:52.098
She turns.

46:52.893 --> 46:57.137
In one, a monster.

46:58.858 --> 47:01.771
Where is mother? - In the bathtub.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.541
He used the thing.

47:34.268 --> 47:37.102
Does he have done that to her?

47:37.480 --> 47:40.348
I dont know. So I've found it.

47:45.196 --> 47:50.112
You must now tell you everything, what do you remember me since yesterday evening.

48:08.302 --> 48:12.763
He said I was a werewolf.

48:14.058 --> 48:16.707
But he has certainly lied.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.640
I think I have only defended me so.

48:21.232 --> 48:25.317
You do not remember? - Only at short images.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.719
You should hide, he said.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.472
And then the dog let to the bathroom window?

48:31.492 --> 48:35.156
So it looks as though Clancy attacked us.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.492
How could I do this to him? - Oh, Lauren!

48:43.212 --> 48:46.831
You are the victim here. Not he.

49:00.062 --> 49:02.429
What's that supposed to be?

49:03.107 --> 49:05.690
I was so hungry.

49:07.361 --> 49:12.231
Her daughter is not a man. - She's a werewolf, right?

49:13.159 --> 49:16.368
You told her. - You must believe me.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.321
And what are you?

49:21.667 --> 49:24.580
I am now a ... I am now also a werewolf.

49:28.757 --> 49:32.091
What? What else could it be?

49:32.761 --> 49:35.411
I'm still living.

49:35.431 --> 49:39.707
This morning I could not feel my arms.

49:39.727 --> 49:42.060
Can you see it!

49:46.609 --> 49:49.192
I am now as Lauren.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.317
You're worse!

49:56.368 --> 50:00.078
You wanted to blame it on the dog. Lauren told me everything.

50:00.664 --> 50:04.078
In order to protect them. To protect Lauren!

50:04.835 --> 50:08.249
That was the only way.

50:09.131 --> 50:13.199
Or, let's say the police that she has your glove found

50:13.219 --> 50:15.802
and has thus only defends against thee.

50:18.766 --> 50:22.350
You must be able to prove my first time.

50:32.655 --> 50:35.693
Could you possibly pull out of this part?

51:54.445 --> 51:56.687
Come immediately to my mother!

52:04.288 --> 52:07.354
Your grandmother should tell you this weekend.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.773
Just as my grandmother told me.

52:09.793 --> 52:13.036
And your great-grandmother told her.

52:18.344 --> 52:24.215
Well, we have a kind of disease. It is inherited from mother to daughter.

52:24.767 --> 52:28.431
I have it, your Grandma Mabel had.

52:29.313 --> 52:33.102
Your great-aunt Cleo she has. And now you.

52:35.235 --> 52:39.104
Yes I know. You told me when I ... three - That was a lie.

52:39.406 --> 52:42.556
You never get meat. When we eat meat,

52:42.576 --> 52:46.741
then we become. So how do you last night.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.813
No shit, I have not eaten meat.

52:49.833 --> 52:54.485
I know. The bastard did Grandmother blood into the wine.

52:54.505 --> 52:58.249
That was the reason for your transformation. The blood.

52:59.218 --> 53:02.802
How so? Why would he do that? - He's crazy, Lauren.

53:04.682 --> 53:09.768
Albert was right. That was actually me. - You did not do anything.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.768
But you. The Beast, in which you have transformed yourself.

53:17.194 --> 53:20.312
And it will happen again, again and again at full moon,

53:20.781 --> 53:25.776
for the rest of your life. You have to resign yourself with it.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.460
Tante Cleo?

53:42.136 --> 53:45.550
There was an incident.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.586
Get that thing out of me!

53:54.606 --> 53:58.566
First you draw from your other glove!

53:59.528 --> 54:03.317
That is silver. If I do not pull out the, you'll die.

54:07.161 --> 54:10.450
So I'm really a werewolf.

54:10.664 --> 54:15.034
Yes, you now sharing Laurens curse.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.749
Curse?

54:20.799 --> 54:24.463
That is a gift. - Slide it over to me!

54:37.816 --> 54:40.684
They knew it. Yes, you knew about it!

54:43.155 --> 54:46.193
This was her first time. - You are also one.

54:47.201 --> 54:50.569
No. Do not move!

54:52.206 --> 54:55.699
That was luck. It only gets your lungs.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.546
Yes, after all, not your heart.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.716
Hey! Oh, shit!

55:16.271 --> 55:19.230
What happened? - Come first with!

55:29.618 --> 55:33.644
Lauren has transformed. - What?

55:33.664 --> 55:37.248
I know. I would not have thought of that happening.

55:38.544 --> 55:42.163
And who is that guy there? - Albert. He's from the old people's home.

55:42.798 --> 55:46.792
He knows of Laurens situation, and he would lie to cover it.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.590
What about Mabel? - She is dead.

55:53.308 --> 55:55.641
Lauren? - I dont know.

55:56.270 --> 56:00.671
But you gotta out of here on the spot. She's in my mother's room.

56:00.691 --> 56:04.731
Harold! She's still your daughter.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.282
Thank you.

56:27.551 --> 56:31.535
You have not told him?

56:31.555 --> 56:34.719
If I had done that, you would be dead now.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.747
Sorry, Daddy. - It's not your fault, sweetie.

57:03.712 --> 57:06.500
No matter what happens, I will always love you.

57:19.853 --> 57:22.721
Wait! We need them.

57:24.733 --> 57:27.191
No, she should never have been here.

57:31.365 --> 57:35.140
It should look as if you have my mother and the dog found.

57:35.160 --> 57:38.369
And then I found you.

57:39.539 --> 57:42.522
What do you want it? - I have to make the bedroom clean.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.831
And the cross? - Oh, you do not die already!

57:46.046 --> 57:49.196
And also, how do I know that you do not attack me,

57:49.216 --> 57:52.050
if I pull it? - I...

57:52.719 --> 57:55.302
I am helpless.

57:56.556 --> 57:59.424
I doubt that.

58:11.613 --> 58:16.483
I have to help Mom. Can I leave you alone?

58:24.084 --> 58:26.246
Thanks, Dad.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.399
Was that all?

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:37.373
Driving to Zanesville and paid in cash!

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.522
And do you want to really pull out now?

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.310
It has served its purpose.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.504
How is your leg? - I'm okay.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.526
Now the only thing to do.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.592
Hey! Good boy! Here!

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.464
Okay, now.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.545
And what now?

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.709
We pray.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.595
Again the same thing. - Why?

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.833
The old lady slipped in the bathtub.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:58.713
The wound comes from the tap. - The period coincides.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:02.759
Mrs. Redd has said that her mother was still alive on the day after the full moon.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:07.347
It lacks the liver. That the dog does not fit.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:11.851
The bite marks are too large in area. You can not come from this dog.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:14.854
Is just a mess. I find that too unspecific.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:18.441
Our maniac kills young girls, old women no.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.735
Yes, so far. Your neighbor is dead.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:25.198
Yes, died of a heart attack. Days earlier. Terrified of the wolf, eh?

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:29.202
May sound strange. - So, the context does not reveal itself to me.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:33.373
The neighbor was overweight and old woman. Absolutely plausible.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:36.543
According to report, it was an accident. And I have no doubt.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.397
Where is the motive for murder?

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:43.726
There is a connection.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:49.149
I'll tell you what, Mort. Prove it. Then I believe it.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:29.356
Mills, ich bin in Mabel Longes Apartment.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:32.241
The same is clean.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.244
Nothing special.

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:42.460
Bin in the bathroom, the tub checke.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:03.310
Bingo, Millsey! I found a photo of a teenage girl.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:08.812
About the same age as the previous victim.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.401
Would have to be her granddaughter.

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.708
Is she okay?

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:16.453
Goes again. - Why did they roared so?

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:20.331
Because of the doorbell. My daughter has a very sensitive hearing.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.168
Who are you, anyway? - Mortimer Clark.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:26.463
I am the pathologist who performed the autopsy on has by Mrs Longe.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.424
Good. And what they want from us, Mr Clark?

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:33.136
Tell your daughter, she was lately with her grandmother?

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:36.775
Yes, last weekend, specifically to support them when brushing.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.739
Maybe she is in danger.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.790
That's ridiculous. - A serial killer is after young girls.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:49.569
He could also be behind her. - Had we not informed the police about it?

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:52.197
I think he has Mabel killed to get at them.

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:55.742
That's enough now! Really! - Comes the violation of a bite?

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:58.495
Yes, by a dog. But that's been a while.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.705
Can I see again? - No! They disappear quickly now!

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:02.762
I want to look at me the wound. - I'm not sure that you are the,

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.210
for which you claim to be. - Please excuse.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.129
I'm just trying to help. - You are trying to help?

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:11.508
Then make my daughter not afraid to talk about the serial killer!

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.111
It's bad enough what happened.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.435
Mills, I've just come from the family Redd.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.480
They were upset when I told of the murderer.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.525
The mother has confirmed that Lauren Redd, her daughter,

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:32.038
has stayed in Apartment Mrs Longes on Saturday.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.799
What if the killer discovers the girl and then killed the old man,

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:38.718
to get at it? Perhaps he thought that she comes back.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:43.623
Lauren had a bite track on her right arm.

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:46.761
In about the same size as the other victims.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.547
But it was more of a scar, an old wound.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:53.424
According to the mother that was a dog some time ago.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:56.761
Mills, They thought that would be a coincidence. To me, that fits but together.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.806
Mrs. Redd said, grandmother and granddaughter were cleaned.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.159
This fits also.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.334
Oh, Mann!

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.537
Your stupid colleagues are dealing with the crime scene

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:27.332
taken not very accurate everywhere in the living room are bloodstains.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.720
But nothing on the carpet, which was probably replaced.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:37.189
Spring cleaning, my ass! Someone is trying to cover up something.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:42.738
You really should eat and prefer to make your work less Donuts!

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.666
Here, the carpet was also replaced.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:54.795
The tracks lead from the bedroom.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:04.245
The first bloodstains are located opposite the bedroom door, Mills.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:07.053
Perhaps the blood of the old lady.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:11.310
Anyway, if so, it comes from the bathroom.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.142
But the trail leads to the bedroom.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.028
There is not a lot of blood. But it leads to the bed.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.682
The bed is clean.

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:27.661
The bed sheets were probably changed.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.158
On the wall hangs a cross with a little blood on it.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:37.542
It must have been used as a weapon.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.763
The old man has not done that, Mills.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.095
There would otherwise marks in the bathroom.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:58.817
Someone else did. I bet it was the girl.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.654
I know I have no proof, but it fits, Mills.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:08.452
This confusion brings the old lady around the corner, waiting for the little girl,

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:13.272
followed her into the bedroom, she grabs the cross,

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:18.128
stabs him in, and he bled to death in the living room.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.613
He dies.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:24.798
The family can disappear the body, but it's obvious self-defense.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:31.266
Wait Mills! I look around the room.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:35.562
There is much that you can use as a weapon.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.812
Even a sharp pair of scissors.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:42.733
So why they used the cross?

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:47.157
A silver cross.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.275
Welcome back! - Thank you.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:01.571
Where have you been? What was wrong with you? - I do not know, I had a kind of virus.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:05.199
You have missed a fat, gross, cool party.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.213
I want to hear nothing about it. - Eric asked for you.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:13.708
Really now? - I said, you're with your Grandma.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.846
As he laughed. - Why did you do that?

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:21.483
We chatted for a while in his room, and then we started.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.445
He can kiss so incredibly well.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:56.260
Now go to bed! You have school tomorrow.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:02.548
No, I do not want to go tomorrow. I have these nightmares.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.561
They're just dreams, Small.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.709
Mills, you hear! A few things to werewolf theory.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:43.339
I have some research. According to legend, heal wounds

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.217
by werewolves faster than normal people.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.854
What if she was bitten before they killed him?

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:52.765
Then, the wound would have really very quickly transformed into a scar.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:56.561
And one more thing: werewolves have heightened senses.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:59.772
The little one is almost crazy when I rang.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:02.817
Evidence that they, too, is a werewolf.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.376
Or that I am well on the way to the nuthouse.

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:15.389
The laboratory is looking straight into the cross found. Is it made of silver,

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.301
amplifies the the evidence yet.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:34.199
OK. Exactly here. As I have shown you's.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:39.451
I can not do this. - Do it for your daughter!

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.411
I'm going to hurt you. - Give me the syringe!

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:53.168
That's all.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.642
It has not changed, Lauren. And it's nobody's business what.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.087
Welcome back! - Thank you.

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:32.712
Where have you been? What was wrong with you?

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:38.422
Just let us go! - Sure, if you do not want to talk about.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:44.729
Did you just having your period? - Yes, has begun today. How so?

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:50.397
Somehow I can smell it. - Disgusting.

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:16.585
Well, Mills, I have not chosen me,

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:20.806
But the cross is made of solid silver. Old silver one at that.

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:26.595
The blood DNA also does not match the Redd family, I'm afraid.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:33.773
So it does not come from the grandmother or another family member.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:37.360
It must come from the attacker.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:50.119
Hey, Molly! I asked myself: Which of you two is the bloke?

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.165
Come on, we're going in!

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:58.385
Listen quietly to your bitch!

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:07.585
You have a really big mouth. And if you're not soon quiet,

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:10.769
I put you your fucking cigarette in the eye!

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:30.285
Oh, shit! What was that, please? - I do not know, but that was cool.

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:34.296
Lauren!

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.541
Do you know each other?

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:42.342
Is okay. Go ahead! I'll be right there.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:52.806
I'm not sure what to make of all this.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:56.690
I can hardly imagine how you feel.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:01.440
I have a crucifix, with his blood on it.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:07.241
I know you did the right thing.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:13.410
But I do not know if he's dead now.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.709
Is it that, then now is finally closing.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:52.332
Is something wrong? - Can we say well.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:07.680
What you have heard of my family.

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:27.284
I had a daughter. Beautifully as Lauren.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.703
You ran away from home.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:36.577
I've seen it again only on this table.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:40.547
She was 17 years old.

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:49.597
I know what Lauren is.

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:59.103
And now I want to hear only one thing of you, understand?

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:04.609
Lauren would never hurt anyone.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.725
Mort! Are you all right?

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.193
And? Is there anything new in Grandma Case?

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:56.039
Like you said ... just an accident.

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:59.542
The fighting dog ring guy. What's with that?

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:05.332
Was a dead end. - More corpses are shown up yet?

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:09.716
Not since Sparks Girl.

01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:16.176
Perhaps he has stopped.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.431
Although, I will not let him get away.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.817
We have a full moon.

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.738
Unteachable.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:13.442
Aunt Cleo looks worried. - All the best. Do not worry, please.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.467
Now it's up to you.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:49.106
We have you laid a plastic bag. For your clothes.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:53.657
And a blanket, so that you have it warm until ...

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:06.332
In 15 minutes, the moon rises. - We must show quite near you.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:21.430
If you do not want, you do not have to use it.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.723
I'll be fine.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:56.577
Hopefully the door is stable enough. - As long as it in there what there is to eat,

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:59.385
it has no reason to want to come out.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:15.195
Hi, Albert!

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.543
That's a good idea.

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:37.507
Mom has taken a few precautions that I did not kill you.

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:49.723
As I see it feeds you well.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.272
Mom has thought of everything.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.483
I had fully scared.

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:14.123
But now I'm calm.

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:31.102
I also dreamed.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.149
To hunt,

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:36.861
to eat.

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:47.664
It's your fault. That's just your work.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.417
I bet that makes you crazy.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:20.279
I'm sorry, Albert. I can not understand you.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:27.821
I'm going to turn me, Lauren. I'm just like you.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:34.651
I Can you turn, I free myself, and then I zerfleische you!

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:36.788
Do you understand?

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:41.199
You idiot're not one of us! Although I have bitten you.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.244
It is inherited from the mother.

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:47.723
But my wounds heal quickly. - This is the blood.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:51.720
I've already been drinking blood, it never had that effect.

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:55.565
Did not my mother or my grandmother.

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.727
We are special. Our blood heals wounds.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:05.154
And it's addictive, is not it? You get not enough of it.

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:13.458
Our blood will keep you alive, for the rest of my life.

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:19.422
You are no more than a piece of meat for me.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:34.767
It is so far, Albert.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.571
It's me! Albert!

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.407
Albert!

01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:43.792
