D.A. Rosario.
You're here,

01:25.253 --> 01:27.288
in my kitchen.
You can call me Jean

01:27.321 --> 01:28.856
outside of the office, Nancy.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.491
French toast?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.025
Is this an
early-morning meeting or...

01:33.093 --> 01:35.396
Oh.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.401
You slept over last night.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.503
Your dad didn't tell you

01:42.536 --> 01:44.372
about it?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.174
Oh, me being here this morning.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.809
Not what we did last night.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.144
Oh, dear God.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.579
Yeah, a heads-up
would have been nice.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.014
Or traumatizing. I...

01:54.047 --> 01:55.183
haven't decided yet.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.251
Jean, can I help with breakfast?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.789
You're here too.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.893
If I had known we
were having company,

02:05.926 --> 02:07.528
I would have gotten dressed.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.897
I am so sorry that this
caught you off-guard.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.665
Last night, uh, you said

02:11.699 --> 02:14.001
you might stay at George's.
Yeah,

02:14.034 --> 02:15.236
emphasis on "might."

02:16.970 --> 02:18.606
My mistake.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.245
I've been missing from
Horseshoe Bay for two weeks?

02:24.278 --> 02:27.848
I had no idea
that much time had passed.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.284
It's as I feared.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.120
We're trapped
in a parallel reality.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.923
Is that why nobody
in the regular world

02:35.956 --> 02:37.458
can see or hear us

02:37.491 --> 02:39.560
even though we can
see and hear them?

02:39.593 --> 02:43.431
Yes. This liminal space

02:43.464 --> 02:45.466
warps the physical world

02:45.499 --> 02:48.702
and affects
our perception of time.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.138
You were sent here
as soon as you turned the key

02:51.171 --> 02:52.906
in the Copperhead's padlock.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.909
The same thing
happened to me as well.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.745
The night Temperance

02:57.778 --> 03:00.814
returned to Horseshoe Bay
and lowered the barrier,

03:00.848 --> 03:04.151
her arrival activated
a mystical signal.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.820
As Keeper, I was told
that when I saw

03:06.854 --> 03:08.889
the signal of the six roses

03:08.922 --> 03:11.592
I had to unlock
the Hallows Snare,

03:11.625 --> 03:13.427
no matter what was inside.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.674
As soon as the padlock and
the cage door were unlocked...

03:33.547 --> 03:35.115
...I was trapped
in the liminal space.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.620
But why make things
worse for the town

03:39.653 --> 03:42.155
by unleashing the Copperhead?
I have

03:42.189 --> 03:44.692
no idea why they told me
to do that.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.028
I've been trying to make contact
with you all ever since,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.630
but you thought
I was Charity's ghost.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.965
It was a better guess than
"Hannah turned invisible

03:51.999 --> 03:55.135
and is trying to signal us for
help by throwing things at me."

03:55.168 --> 03:56.670
I nearly got a concussion.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.772
I was trying to tell you,

03:58.806 --> 04:02.610
"Please get me out of here.
I don't want to die."

04:02.643 --> 04:05.212
The myths say that
when the moon is full,

04:05.245 --> 04:08.148
all beings inside
are purged from existence.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.883
Forever.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.552
When is the next full moon?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.988
The zenith is at 9:33.
Tonight.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.824
We have to escape before then.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.262
We got to find Nancy.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.467
She's sharp enough to
understand our signals.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.969
As someone who's been knocking
on her door for two weeks,

04:29.002 --> 04:30.371
I disagree.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.708
I can get through to her.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.777
Trust me.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.913
The Long Night Ball was one of my

04:39.947 --> 04:41.815
favorite town traditions.

04:41.849 --> 04:45.686
We'd gather under the full moon
in December and light candles

04:45.719 --> 04:48.155
to illuminate the dark night.
It was beautiful.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.223
Love that you brought it back.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.596
Wow!

04:55.629 --> 04:57.731
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.600
I mean, the color's
great on you,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.903
but I just think the
silhouette is a bit...

05:02.936 --> 05:05.439
floomfy.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.675
That's too bad.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.345
Charity did always have the
perfect figure for ball gowns.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.347
Yeah, it must be really painful

05:13.381 --> 05:15.349
looking just like
your dead daughter.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.017
It is difficult.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.153
But in a way,
it makes me feel closer to her.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.758
Thank you for helping me
pick out a dress, by the way.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.396
I asked Nancy, but she was
on community liaison duty.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.230
Yeah, you two have gotten closer

05:30.263 --> 05:32.566
since the Burning Sorrows
incident.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.069
Speaking of,
why do you think bait

05:36.103 --> 05:39.039
meant for the Copperhead lured
the Burning Sorrows instead?

05:39.072 --> 05:40.974
I'm sure I don't know.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.981
What's with the bloody map?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.083
Oh, it was a ritual, but

05:50.117 --> 05:53.454
the blood trail got blocked by
an unknown obstruction in town.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.288
I think it's working now.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.332
Oh, nice!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.134
We cleaned up the flood
in the bathroom.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.236
I think it was a burst pipe.
Oh. You know what,

06:09.269 --> 06:11.639
someone from Water and Power
came by yesterday.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.974
Maybe they damaged a line
while they were working.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.777
You know what, make the town
pay for the repair.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.078
Even if they did,

06:18.111 --> 06:20.514
this place needs a lot of work.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.783
Might have to sacrifice that
Miami Gardens expansion fund

06:22.816 --> 06:25.586
that Eve suggested.
Hey, that's okay.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.455
Glad the rumors weren't true,

06:27.488 --> 06:29.690
about you breaking off
your engagement.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.626
We did break it off.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just...

06:32.660 --> 06:34.027
you don't look broken up.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.929
Oh, we're still
together, we're just,

06:35.963 --> 06:37.498
you know, not getting
married right now.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.433
Mm.
Huh.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.333
Okay.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.641
Oh.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.176
I'll get that.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.951
The genealogical tracing
to determine

06:57.985 --> 06:59.787
future Copperhead victims
is a massive task.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.456
Uh, thousands of people can be
traced back to the criteria

07:02.490 --> 07:04.692
of descendants
of Gettysburg soldiers.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.160
Uh, the Boston field office
is helping...

07:07.194 --> 07:09.997
Oh... How many pages
is this document?

07:15.202 --> 07:18.238
Ugh. God. You do not
have to help me with this.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.240
Yeah, I'm not sure
I've been much help.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.411
Oh. You, uh,
got a little...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.113
Uh...

07:33.253 --> 07:35.523
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

07:35.556 --> 07:37.691
That was inappropriate
and my fault.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.992
I should have maintained
a more formal distance.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.028
Yeah, no,
I just lost my balance.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.031
Of course. Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.941
Hi.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.108
Hey. You at the precinct?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.544
Unfortunately,

07:56.577 --> 07:57.911
why?
Uh,

07:57.945 --> 08:00.648
we just found a body
behind the youth center.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.459
Tyler? Ryan.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.662
Should have known you'd
pick the yacht club.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.463
Best mixologist in town.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.464
Yeah, it's the only restaurant
my parents could tolerate

08:17.497 --> 08:19.199
back when we summered
on this island.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.234
Well, the elite only summer here

08:21.268 --> 08:23.303
because it's the last
private enclave

08:23.336 --> 08:26.239
for the one percent to
discreetly do business,

08:26.273 --> 08:29.977
which, I'm guessing, is why we're meeting.
Not exactly.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.945
Listen, it's no secret
you've been making

08:31.979 --> 08:33.781
some unreturned calls recently.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.751
Well, you know,
prospecting takes time, Tyler,

08:37.785 --> 08:39.620
you know that.
And-and, besides,

08:39.653 --> 08:41.254
I'm branching out
into-into new directions.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.956
I heard you hit up the deep
pockets of New York

08:42.990 --> 08:45.626
a few weeks back, fundraising
for a local nonprofit.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.828
You've been working wonders
cleaning up the Hudson brand

08:47.861 --> 08:49.630
by investing in a community
you actually spend time in.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.164
I need that.

08:51.198 --> 08:55.102
Okay, so this... this is about PR?
No.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.270
No, my PR team
is busy swatting down

08:57.304 --> 09:00.273
a bunch of fabricated
ethics complaints.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.508
Look, I'm interested in this
personal brand of charity

09:01.541 --> 09:02.643
that you've gotten into here.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.179
If you can facilitate
a charitable capital infusion

09:06.213 --> 09:08.081
to this youth center of yours,

09:08.115 --> 09:10.150
I'll make you my head
of my corporate giving.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.419
With very competitive
compensation.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.355
Yeah, let's, um...
let's talk about that.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.124
Yeah.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.171
What is with you and FBI guy?

09:33.473 --> 09:35.876
Okay, so, earlier,
I thought that Agent Park and I

09:35.909 --> 09:37.277
were having a moment,

09:37.310 --> 09:38.879
so I...

09:38.912 --> 09:41.715
may have leaned in to...

09:41.749 --> 09:43.717
Wait, you did not try
to kiss him, did you?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.485
Mm, no, I did, yeah.
And-and?

09:45.518 --> 09:47.921
And?
And he recoiled in horror.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.390
You got swerved?
Yeah.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.859
He said it was inappropriate,

09:51.892 --> 09:53.493
which I have no idea why.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.128
I technically
don't even work for him.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.397
Just-just chill.
I just-just feel like

09:57.430 --> 09:59.232
I'm really off my game lately.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.068
Ace texted me last night

10:01.101 --> 10:03.136
to meet up about something,

10:03.170 --> 10:05.138
and I thought that m...

10:05.172 --> 10:07.474
I don't know.
I thought that he was...

10:07.507 --> 10:09.476
It doesn't matter.
He stood me up.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.711
Oh.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.413
Oh.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.815
Wait.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.249
Are you saying
that you like Ace?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.651
Oh, come on.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.653
I mean, "Oh, wow,
how did I miss this?"

10:19.687 --> 10:22.089
Girl, look at you, with two
suitors, Ms. Twosy-Drew.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.091
They're not suitors.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.259
I sound like a...
A healthy, single woman

10:26.293 --> 10:27.928
with agency and options?
Mm-hmm.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.597
Thank you.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.834
No visible wounds,
bruising, or obvious signs

10:33.867 --> 10:35.335
of assault,
it's possible our John Doe

10:35.368 --> 10:36.704
died of natural causes.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.439
Or supernatural causes.
Agreed.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.341
His chest cavity
was still intact,

10:41.374 --> 10:42.943
which rules out
the Copperhead's M.O.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.444
but I still have to investigate
any possible connection

10:44.477 --> 10:46.279
- to that case.
- Uh, Nick,

10:46.313 --> 10:47.681
will you come with
me real quick?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.116
Uh, yeah.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.086
I-I hope what happened earlier

10:53.120 --> 10:55.555
won't affect
our working dynamic.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.525
Nothing happened earlier.
In that case, should we

10:58.558 --> 10:59.960
carpool back
to the station together?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.461
No. I'll drive myself.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.964
That way we can keep
a formal distance.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.542
Hey, Nick. I have someone

11:15.575 --> 11:16.977
I want to bring over
to the youth center.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.780
Uh, no, now-now
is not the best time.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.549
No, but listen, this is Tyler
Gillis, the tech billionaire.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.085
He wants to give the center
a million bucks.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.087
We-we just found a dead body

11:27.120 --> 11:28.989
out back. Wait, did...
Uh...

11:29.022 --> 11:31.158
did you say a million dollars?
Yes!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.493
Yes. A million. A million bucks.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.262
Look, how about-how about
I just send over

11:35.295 --> 11:38.131
the email offer for now,
okay? Okay.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.034
He's so excited.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
The utilities company called
on the way back here.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.140
They've never
seen the victim before.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.577
Howdy. Uh, so far the autopsy
results are the kind of weird

11:50.610 --> 11:53.446
where it's best to loop in Nancy.
Well, I'm flattered.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.448
I'm declaring
the cause of death inconclusive.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.417
Zero internal trauma.
Like

11:57.450 --> 11:58.752
the life was sucked
right out of him.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.888
I would know...
I sat through Leo's

12:00.921 --> 12:03.490
first-grade production-slash-
debasement of Our Town.

12:03.523 --> 12:07.327
Anyway, pulled an ID
from our victim's prints.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.129
John Doe was named
Michael Isaacs.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.164
Appreciate the help.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.966
Just doing my job.
Speaking of,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.303
I'm looking forward to Ace's
interview this afternoon.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.471
Oh, I... I didn't
know about that.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.510
Radios. That's how
we get her attention.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.847
H... Uh, how did you
move things before?

12:26.880 --> 12:30.617
Focus on the object, then fully
commit to your intended action,

12:30.650 --> 12:33.120
but be careful...

12:33.153 --> 12:35.789
moving things
takes a lot of energy.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.590
Okay.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.896
Nancy, can you hear me?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.617
Let's find out what we can
about Michael Isaacs.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.802
Ace, I really think
Temperance is up to no good,

13:22.836 --> 13:24.571
and I can't tell Nancy,
'cause, you know,

13:24.604 --> 13:26.106
she only responds
to hard evidence,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.608
and I don't have
any actual proof.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.145
Temperance is slipperier
than a well-moisturized newt.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.281
Help me. Please.
Don't make me beg.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.156
What's that?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.262
I don't know.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.664
I've never seen
this metal before.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.634
So that wasn't what you were
looking for with your blood map?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.139
All will be revealed in time.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.615
Hey.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.483
We better hope this guy
from Water and Power

14:10.517 --> 14:13.586
died of a heart attack, because
this is one million dollars

14:13.620 --> 14:15.188
from Tyler Gillis.
All right?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.624
I mean, this money
could go to-to repairs

14:17.657 --> 14:19.426
and educational programs,
scholarships...

14:19.459 --> 14:21.494
Hey, you wouldn't have to use
your expansion fund, then.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.796
I could open up
my center back home.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.200
W-Wait-wait a sec. Tyler Gillis
makes his microchips

14:27.234 --> 14:29.369
from ruthenium mines
that have poisoned

14:29.402 --> 14:30.971
several communities'
water tables.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.473
Really?
No, no, no, hold on, now.

14:33.506 --> 14:37.177
Hold on. Tyler's making amends
to those communities.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.645
Well, an apology
doesn't really mean much

14:38.678 --> 14:40.880
when you have no drinking water.
Sure.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.615
But everything from
your cell phone

14:42.649 --> 14:44.317
to the overnighted art supplies
in the youth center

14:44.351 --> 14:48.121
come from exploited workers
or environmental abuse.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.524
So if some rich guy wants to-to
ease his conscience

14:51.558 --> 14:54.561
by throwing money at our good
cause, then why not let him?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.964
Because that money is never free.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.632
Okay, look, don't
take my word for it, right?

14:59.666 --> 15:00.900
Go ahead, read Tyler's offer

15:00.934 --> 15:02.369
and find the strings attached.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.938
I mean, there are
stipulations about

15:04.972 --> 15:07.674
how the money should be spent.
This one,

15:07.707 --> 15:10.177
requiring me to build a
swimming pool out back...

15:10.210 --> 15:13.380
that is oddly specific.
W... A pool?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.382
Okay, no. Absolutely not.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.152
This property is on
unceded Passamaquoddy land and

15:19.186 --> 15:22.422
our tribe considers the field
out back especially sacred.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.324
We have yearly ceremonies there.
I mean,

15:24.357 --> 15:26.693
the land is our mother
and we have to respect it.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.695
Okay, let's lose the pool.
I'll talk to Tyler,

15:28.728 --> 15:30.563
I'll get it
taken out of the contract.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.734
Thought you were a dealmaker
that could get this done.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.503
Nick doesn't agree
to the swimming pool,

15:36.536 --> 15:38.238
I am rescinding my offer.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.739
I'm not an idiot,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.574
Tyler. I know
this isn't about a pool.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.112
You looking for another
ruthenium mine?

15:46.379 --> 15:49.549
That NDA you had me sign is
terrifyingly iron-clad, so...

15:51.118 --> 15:53.720
It's not ruthenium.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.955
It's a completely untapped
rare earth ore.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.359
An extremely powerful
semiconductor

15:59.392 --> 16:01.294
that will transform microchips.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.497
So you think there's an ore
under the youth center.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.133
Is there any chance
that you hired someone

16:06.166 --> 16:08.735
to survey that land?

16:08.768 --> 16:11.938
No. No, my satellites
did a Geo scan of the area

16:11.971 --> 16:15.042
after detecting weird
seismic activity two weeks back.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.878
Look, I'm concerned
my competitor Swift Enterprises

16:18.911 --> 16:20.580
may have figured out
the ore is here as well.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.450
So this
isn't about a youth center.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.419
Or me.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.489
Look, the donation offer
is real.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.458
You get me that swimming pool...

16:32.759 --> 16:34.527
...keys to the clubhouse are yours.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.966
You know

16:39.999 --> 16:41.568
that woman you saw me
outside with...

16:41.601 --> 16:43.970
Uh-huh.
Temperance? She used

16:44.003 --> 16:46.973
this unusual divination tool
that led to exactly where

16:47.006 --> 16:49.809
the man died and where
the ore was buried.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.378
Look, I'll show you.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.982
This ore... this is what
the dead man was digging for,

16:56.015 --> 16:58.785
and Temperance was
fascinated by it.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.156
I'm just afraid that she's
up to something nefarious.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.225
I did get a vibe from her.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.994
Yeah, a 200-year-old
wily witch vibe?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.963
No, I was gonna say
entitled, but, yeah, okay, sure.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.432
That too.
Yeah.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.867
I just wish I could make her

17:14.901 --> 17:17.237
tell me the truth
about her plan.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.141
Wait.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.615
Yes. Okay,
so I recently found a ritual

17:28.648 --> 17:30.883
that compels people
to tell the truth.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.353
Uh, this particular potion
is activated by fire,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.822
and Temperance is doing a
candle lighting at her ball.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.058
So I could dose her and
then interrogate her.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.829
Oh, you were being literal
about the witch thing.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.431
Too much?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.235
Hey, look, I already told you:

17:48.268 --> 17:50.069
interesting is hot.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.313
High-end contract firm
Michael Isaacs worked for

18:00.347 --> 18:02.582
refuses to name their
clients without a subpoena.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.117
We might have another lead.

18:04.151 --> 18:07.487
Ryan says that
billionaire Tyler Gillis

18:07.520 --> 18:10.357
is offering a big donation
to the youth center.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.891
Ryan's handling the deal,
but he's worried

18:11.924 --> 18:13.360
that a death
on the property might

18:13.393 --> 18:15.495
turn Tyler off.
Not quite grasping the lead.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.231
Tyler really wants
to build a pool

18:18.265 --> 18:19.732
behind the youth center.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.701
So he wants to keep digging

18:21.734 --> 18:24.504
in the same backyard where
Michael Isaacs died digging

18:24.537 --> 18:26.373
for something mysterious.
Ah.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.741
A tech billionaire like Tyler
could've secretly hired

18:28.775 --> 18:31.511
Michael's firm,
but if I try to ask Tyler

18:31.544 --> 18:34.013
about it, he'll lawyer up.
True.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.916
But everyone loves to chat

18:36.949 --> 18:39.452
with an heiress, so I'll talk
to Tyler tonight at the ball.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.554
I'll make sure Ryan brings him.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.290
Why'd you stand me up yesterday,
question mark.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.160
Hi.
Hi.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.263
Any sign of billionaire Tyler?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.164
No, not yet.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.367
Guess he's late.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.939
Less than two hours
before the moon reaches zenith.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.575
We will find a way
to reach Nancy.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.377
Okay.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.081
Okay.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.251
So when Temperance lights
that candle,

19:44.284 --> 19:46.152
it'll release a puff of smoke
that makes her tell the truth?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.954
Yes, but the wick
needs to be wet,

19:47.987 --> 19:49.589
so I have to give it to her now.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.791
The spell should last
an hour or so,

19:51.824 --> 19:53.360
but that's more than enough time
to question her.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.598
Temperance. Hi.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.800
I know you were busy
with last-minute arrangements,

20:00.833 --> 20:03.169
so I grabbed your candle for you.
Thank you.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.771
Always the star pupil.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.573
I try.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.316
Welcome to the Long Night Ball.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.418
Let's begin our candle lighting.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.221
♪ ♪

20:29.596 --> 20:31.631
This is
a Horseshoe Bay tradition

20:31.664 --> 20:33.866
on the longest night
of the year.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.569
Normally we would each
light our votives

20:36.603 --> 20:39.038
from this altar candle, but...

20:39.071 --> 20:41.374
in the spirit of togetherness,

20:41.408 --> 20:43.209
let's pass the light along
instead.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.627
Thank you.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.632
You know, I wonder
if he looks that good

21:05.665 --> 21:07.600
without clothes.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.702
Yeah, well, I thought
Nick was my soulmate,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.604
but ever since we
called off the wedding,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.406
I've been wondering
if that's true.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.242
I mean, what if I just never
knew I was capable of being

21:16.275 --> 21:17.810
with anyone else
because he's been my only

21:17.844 --> 21:19.712
healthy relationsh... ship?

21:23.316 --> 21:24.584
Nick...

21:24.617 --> 21:26.252
Hey!
Yeah.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.688
I think something went wrong
with your truth spell.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.689
George just blew up
her relationship

21:29.722 --> 21:32.258
and your friend Nancy
is either super horny

21:32.291 --> 21:34.794
or has no filter.
Why can't I stop talking?

21:34.827 --> 21:37.196
So you know that pair of socks
you found in the freezer?

21:37.229 --> 21:39.632
I left them there by accident
and I blamed Leo.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.335
Hmm, I figured. Also, I
didn't accidentally shrink

21:42.369 --> 21:44.537
your Phish shirt in the
wash... I threw it away.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.439
Oh.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.141
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Temperance must've used

21:49.175 --> 21:51.844
her candle to somehow
douse everyone else's.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.280
We are being compelled to tell
the absolute literal truth,

21:54.313 --> 21:55.848
even if we try not to!

21:55.882 --> 21:57.650
I've been outfoxed.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.588
You figured out
the candle ritual.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.791
But guess what?
That dress isn't your color.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.793
And nope, that's a lie.
You look great in it.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
Excuse me.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.273
God, I'm a disaster whose
ambition will never match

22:21.307 --> 22:24.477
her skills. Also...
do I have B.O.?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.813
I sweat when I'm nervous
and I'm smelling garlic.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.781
Okay, Bess, focus.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.150
You smell a little, but I have
deodorant in my clutch.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.119
And Temperance got hit, too.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.622
Right?
You can still interrogate her.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.857
She can't get her hands on
that ore... it's too important!

22:39.426 --> 22:41.193
Wait, you know what the ore is?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.731
The... metal is
culturally and historically

22:44.764 --> 22:47.400
significant to my community.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.736
One ancient medicine man even

22:49.769 --> 22:51.404
believed it could heal wounds.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.740
I didn't say anything
before because...

22:53.773 --> 22:56.208
working with that metal
is considered

22:56.242 --> 22:58.077
a closed practice...
it's private.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.179
So please don't say anything.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.482
No, I-I swear I won't, okay?

23:02.515 --> 23:04.283
And-and I won't let
Temperance desecrate

23:04.316 --> 23:06.686
tribal land to get to that ore.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.258
It's been bothering me all day
that you didn't tell Nancy

23:12.291 --> 23:14.427
I was staying over last night.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.730
I was scared to tell her.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.833
My last relationship after her
mom died did not go well.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.736
I made a lot of mistakes.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.276
I just don't want
to disappoint either of you.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.281
But trying to protect Nancy and
me just infantilizes us both.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.588
Is Tyler here yet?

23:41.621 --> 23:43.690
No, he's running late.
Double-booked.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.025
Why do you seem so intense?

23:46.058 --> 23:48.561
Because I think he's after
the land behind the youth center

23:48.595 --> 23:51.063
and had a role in Michael Isaac's death.
Oh, no.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.032
Tyler wouldn't kill anyone.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.534
I mean, sure, he wants the land

23:54.567 --> 23:56.035
because it's full
of some special ore,

23:56.068 --> 23:58.304
but I... Oh...

23:58.337 --> 24:00.707
I was not supposed
to tell you that.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.610
Look, my-my point is is
that Tyler's a capitalist.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.945
He's not a murderer.
Oh, don't be naïve, Ryan.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.114
Excuse me?

24:08.147 --> 24:10.449
You're so desperate to get

24:10.483 --> 24:12.451
your Hudson clout back that
you'd let anybody play you.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.754
I'm desperate?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.923
And getting played?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.758
Well, you think
you know everything

24:18.791 --> 24:20.727
all the time, but you don't.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.929
And you know who thought
they were the smartest person

24:22.962 --> 24:24.497
in the room? Celia.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.898
And look what that got her.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.634
I didn't...

24:27.667 --> 24:29.502
I Di-I Di...

24:29.536 --> 24:31.904
I did not mean to say that
to you, I'm-I'm sorry.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.506
Okay, so I accidentally dosed

24:33.540 --> 24:34.774
everyone in the room
with truth serum,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.976
so it's made things a bit

24:37.009 --> 24:38.711
heightened.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.750
Nancy, I...
Forget it.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.018
We use the situation
to our advantage.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.789
Nancy, I've been
looking for you.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.290
I need to tell you something.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.660
I think it's time
that I start building a life

24:53.693 --> 24:55.662
that is less entwined with yours.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.697
I totally hear you
and I'm happy for you.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.866
Do you think we should make
a family schedule?

24:59.899 --> 25:02.869
Maybe you could hang
a sign on the doorknob?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.872
Whoa! Nancy.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.173
Hi.
Yeah, tell your friend Ace

25:07.206 --> 25:08.941
not to bother to reschedule.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.610
Should've known. Hair that
good never works in a morgue.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.679
So Ace didn't come
to your meeting?

25:12.712 --> 25:15.147
No.
That worries me.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.985
Hold that thought.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.055
Mr. Gillis, hi.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.324
I'm Nancy Hudson.
Welcome to the party.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.959
Mind if I just light
your candle there?

25:26.993 --> 25:28.661
Why? What's with the candles?

25:28.695 --> 25:31.163
Oh, they're just doused

25:31.197 --> 25:32.565
in truth seru...

25:34.033 --> 25:35.401
Are you okay?

25:35.434 --> 25:37.369
No, I'm trying to get you...

25:37.403 --> 25:39.205
Never mind.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.472
So-so-so what, you want,

25:40.506 --> 25:41.841
you want to date
other people or...

25:41.874 --> 25:44.176
Uh, maybe.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.745
Look, I want to grow
next to you.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.146
But I still want to grow.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.915
These are options I never got

25:48.948 --> 25:50.983
to explore when I had
an expiration date.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.920
So-so how-how long have you,
have you known this?

25:53.953 --> 25:55.922
I thought about telling you
at the courthouse,

25:55.955 --> 25:57.523
but you were still so sad.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.526
I want us to be together
for the right reasons.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.494
Not because we just settled
for each other.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.931
Oh, you-you settled for me?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.233
What, because I was
the first nice guy

26:07.266 --> 26:08.935
who didn't treat you like...
Like what?

26:08.968 --> 26:10.837
Like poor slutty George
with her hard life

26:10.870 --> 26:12.939
and her drunk mom
and her parade of death curses?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.373
Okay, no, I never pitied you.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.842
Yeah.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.944
But you really wanted
to save me, right?

26:20.647 --> 26:23.215
Yes.
Yeah.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.451
'Cause you know what, Nick?
That's your move.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.519
You want to save everyone else
so you don't have to deal

26:27.553 --> 26:29.255
with your own problems.
Oh, you know what, I don't... I don't...

26:29.288 --> 26:30.790
I don't feel like
getting yelled at again.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.591
Stop running away from me

26:32.625 --> 26:35.127
like you do everything else!

26:35.161 --> 26:37.429
Nick, if you have something
to say, say it right now.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.235
Did you ever really love me?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.373
Desperately.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.809
But you know
that was never enough.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.645
It could never compare
to the fantasy that you built

26:52.679 --> 26:54.513
in your own head
to escape your own trauma.

27:05.491 --> 27:08.294
Damn it.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.102
You okay?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.337
'Cause you're composing yourself

27:18.370 --> 27:19.672

27:19.706 --> 27:21.473
No, I'm not okay.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.010
But I'm surprised that you care.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.847
You think

27:27.880 --> 27:29.615
that I don't care

27:29.648 --> 27:34.620
because...
I avoided kissing you.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.456
Yes.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.292
Why did you pull away?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.729
Don't say that it was
because it was inappropriate,

27:42.762 --> 27:45.297
'cause that...
seems like an excuse.

27:45.331 --> 27:45.998
If you don't like me...

27:46.032 --> 27:48.034
I can't stop thinking about you.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.804

29:42.614 --> 29:45.151
I didn't hire or kill

They rally around anyone

30:50.849 --> 30:52.985
who participates.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.221
That's what they did with me.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.057
Why don't you try
this tradition?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.659
It's to illuminate
the long night.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.902
So tell me, Tyler,

31:09.936 --> 31:11.503
did you hire Michael Isaacs

31:11.537 --> 31:13.472
to find the ore
at the youth center?

31:13.505 --> 31:16.408
Yeah, I hired Michael.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.911
Why the hell
did I just say that?

31:18.945 --> 31:21.247
Because you're
just being honest with me.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.816
Were you involved
in Michael's death?

31:29.121 --> 31:30.422
Well, I didn't even know
Michael was dead.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.790
Last night I asked him to get

31:31.823 --> 31:33.459
a larger sample of the ore,

31:33.492 --> 31:35.294
then his equipment started
getting crazy readings

31:35.327 --> 31:36.828
and the call dropped.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.665
Trust me,
if I had known he died,

31:39.698 --> 31:41.934
I would've just paid someone
to get the body out of there

31:41.968 --> 31:44.270

I need a Hudson and a Marvin
to help me.

35:25.824 --> 35:28.260
Nancy, Bess...

35:28.294 --> 35:30.496
you must be my Sisters-in-White.

35:42.073 --> 35:45.110
Now we are truly connected
by blood...

35:45.143 --> 35:47.179
niece.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.951
From the liminal

35:52.984 --> 35:55.153
to the physical...

35:55.187 --> 35:58.224
the ephemeral to the material...

35:58.257 --> 36:00.926
return to whence you came.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.573
Hi.

36:17.343 --> 36:20.045
Figured if I was gonna get
obliterated from existence,

36:20.078 --> 36:22.414
it might as well happen
while I was looking at a friend.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.216
You're back, Mr. Ace.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.884
Oh, yeah, I am.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.919
Oh, my God. Hannah.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.921
I am so sorry
that we didn't realize

36:29.955 --> 36:31.923
you were stuck
in a liminal space.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.260
There's an apology I
thought I'd never say.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.428
No, it's, it's my fault.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.164
When you said you were
"stepping away" in your text,

36:39.197 --> 36:41.066
I thought you meant
for a vacation.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.034
After that ordeal, I need

36:43.068 --> 36:44.870
an indefinite vacation
from Horseshoe Bay.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.738
Bess, will you watch

36:46.772 --> 36:49.441
over the Historical Society
a while longer? I need

36:49.475 --> 36:52.110
to put a plan in place for my succession.
You're quitting?

36:52.143 --> 36:54.746
As Keepers, we swear
an oath to protect the town,

36:54.780 --> 36:57.015
without question,
but my sense of duty

36:57.048 --> 36:59.518
almost got me killed.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.787
And now two innocent people
are dead

37:01.820 --> 37:03.689
because I opened
the Copperhead's cage.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.792
I'm done.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.795
Please excuse me.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.271
Can I, uh...

37:19.305 --> 37:21.640
take you out to dinner?

37:21.673 --> 37:24.476
You don't...
you don't have to...

37:24.510 --> 37:26.578
take me out because of tonight.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.747
I know that we were
influenced by a mystical

37:28.780 --> 37:30.449
truth serum.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.385
The serum's worn off.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.288
And I don't regret anything.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.957
Unless you do?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.660
No. It was amazing.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.229
And yes to dinner.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.031
I can't wait.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.806
Forgot my coat.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.876
I'll, uh...
bring the car around.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.052
I feel like I should've figured
out what happened to you sooner.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.254
It was not an intuitive puzzle.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.089
I saw you had
a lot going on today.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.626
Were you with me the whole time?

38:14.660 --> 38:16.762
No.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.498
At the precinct,
uh, with the radios.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.701
And then... the dance floor,

38:22.734 --> 38:24.202
and, um, Morse code.

38:24.235 --> 38:25.937
Yeah, that was smart.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.006
Thanks.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.980
Good night.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.648
Good night.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.061
Everything turn out okay?

38:50.095 --> 38:51.363
Yeah.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.832
But I'm a total idiot.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.901
How could I have
gotten it all so

38:55.934 --> 38:58.003
wrong? It's just...

38:58.036 --> 39:01.039

you're pretty great.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.886
Please don't beat yourself up.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.056
Also... we never did
get our dance.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.391
True.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.895
And thank you.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.997
Truly, for being down
for all this weirdness.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.099
I'm sure you have questions.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.868
Mm, one, at the moment.

39:29.901 --> 39:33.539
Why do you think that artifact
was buried there?

39:35.073 --> 39:37.409
I don't know.

40:25.256 --> 40:28.326
What are you doing here?

40:28.359 --> 40:31.129
There's a large artifact buried here.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.933
A supernatural seal a shaman
crafted from a rare earth ore.

40:34.966 --> 40:38.069
That seal masks
and contains something

40:38.103 --> 40:40.906
that I've long been
searching for.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.408
A tear in the veil
between this world

40:43.441 --> 40:45.410
and the darkness below.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.181
Your phone won't work here.

40:50.215 --> 40:54.019
I'm going to reassemble
my daughter's soul and then

40:54.052 --> 40:56.688
I'm gonna destroy the seal
that separates our worlds.

40:56.722 --> 41:00.258
And she will surrender
to her destiny.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.661
Is this, uh, is this why
they kicked you out of town

41:02.694 --> 41:05.030
200 years ago?
Yes.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.798
And you will give me access

41:06.832 --> 41:08.399
to this tent
while I complete my ritual.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.206
And why would I let you do that?

41:15.240 --> 41:18.443
Because I already put a hex
on the head of every child

41:18.476 --> 41:20.211
at your youth center.

41:20.245 --> 41:23.014
And if you try to stop me

41:23.048 --> 41:24.783
or tell anyone,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.417
they'll all die.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.823
In three days, it will be done.
