03:04.880 --> 03:06.791

smartest man in New Salem.

03:36.890 --> 03:40.591
- Ain't yuh, Abe?

03:55.320 --> 03:57.231
Well, I was aimin'

03:57.600 --> 04:00.797

- Well, I'm a peaceable man.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.712

04:20.240 --> 04:21.673
Like a sack o' meal.

Well, that's a pretty long
chuck for a peaceful man.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.469

04:35.080 --> 04:37.640

04:37.720 --> 04:39.676
Man, don't you ever rest?

04:39.920 --> 04:44.789
Whare be he?
That yellow-livered baboon from Indianny!

04:45.560 --> 04:48.870
I come from Indianny,
but not that part.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.639
Well, get down!

04:51.440 --> 04:54.318
Let's see what bones

06:03.080 --> 06:04.308
Hold on, boys!

06:04.920 --> 06:06.239
He throwed me fair.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.313
What's your name?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.913
Lincoln,...
Abraham Lincoln.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.756
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.231
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!

06:18.520 --> 06:19.873
It's about time you set 'em up.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.315
Let's have some o'
that rattlesnake bite.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.633
He said he was a peaceful man.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.877
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.433
Yeh, that's what he thought.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.238
Looks like good corn liquor.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.112
That is corn liquor.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.112
Come on, Abe. Where's yours?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.358
No, I don't care much for it.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.357
Come on, have a drink, Abe.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.231
Well, I'll drink
if you'll take it like I do.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.789
How's that?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.590
Lift up the barrel,
and drink it outa the bung.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.908
Well, I'll show you boys.

06:58.840 --> 07:02.674
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.873
Whew!

07:22.400 --> 07:24.197
He's the strongest man in Salem!

07:24.520 --> 07:26.351
I told you he was the strongest man.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.233
I've seen him lift
500 pounds in each hand.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.276
- Ain't yuh drinkin?
- No.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.958
- Teetotal?
- No.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.874
Reformer?

07:39.360 --> 07:41.749
No, I don't
regulate nobody's drinkin'

07:42.560 --> 07:43.754
just my own.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.560
I've seen him lift a thousand...

07:50.360 --> 07:53.432
- In this sense,-
- the term "law" -

07:54.360 --> 07:59.559
- includes any edict,-
- decree, order,-

08:00.320 --> 08:05.633
- ordinance,-
- statute, resolutión,-

08:06.360 --> 08:09.033
rule, etcetera. -

08:10.200 --> 08:13.749
¡Uff!, etcetera...

08:20.240 --> 08:23.869
Well, my old Daddy
taught me how to work,

08:24.080 --> 08:25.877
but he never
taught me how to like it.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.119
I reckon I better
keep on with the lesson.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.828
I'd rather keep on
with something else.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.831
You made a bad bargain
making me the professor.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.390
Well he told me about that too.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.390
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.118
hug it all the tighter".

08:51.080 --> 08:53.958
But he didn't mean
this kind of a bargain.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.314
Well, don't you like it,
Ann, when I hold you tight?

09:02.680 --> 09:05.399
I guess every girl sorta likes that...

09:08.000 --> 09:12.232
Now, Abe, what is law?

09:13.520 --> 09:20.039
Well, professor, law is a rule
of human conduct governing

09:20.280 --> 09:21.554
Whoa!

09:23.440 --> 09:28.594
Abe, I'ain't payin' you no forty
cents a day to spark a pretty gal!

09:29.080 --> 09:31.640
Well, Uncle Jimmie,
I don't charge nothing extra for it

09:31.800 --> 09:33.028
just throw it in.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.872
I'm expectin'
a sight of rails cut of you.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.597
He's the best
rail-splitter in the country.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.674
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.712
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.359
Oh nearin' forty.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.277
I'll get you out forty
more rails than you expected.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.915
Giddap! Maybe you'd better
make it nearin' seventy!

10:13.720 --> 10:17.952
Now, Abe,
your professor needs a seat

10:18.120 --> 10:20.918
where's there's more law
and less temptatión.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.036
Oh, Abe! Ohhh!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.036
Ohhhh!

10:34.080 --> 10:36.071
- Are you all right, Anne?
- I think so.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.198
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.078
Scared me worse than it did you.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.953
Did it, Abe?

10:47.960 --> 10:53.876
You know, Anne, if anything happened
to you, I don't think I could live.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.788
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.318
You taught me how to love.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.109
Have I taught you to like it?

11:15.440 --> 11:22.630
In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-

11:23.080 --> 11:31.237
When the lights are dim and low,-

11:32.160 --> 11:36.950
And the quiet shadows falling. -

11:37.160 --> 11:46.239
Softly come and softly go. -

11:47.880 --> 11:49.632
It's awful nice this time of day.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.873
Yes, Abe.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.550
Can I tell you
a sort of a story, Anne?

11:54.920 --> 11:57.150
Why of course, Abe.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.318
Well, there was
a town in lllinois called...

12:01.360 --> 12:02.588
called...

12:02.680 --> 12:04.796
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.035
And in that town lived
the prettiest girl in the worid.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.953
What was her name?

12:11.240 --> 12:12.559
Anne Rutledge.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.553
Oh, Abe...

12:17.240 --> 12:20.038
What I'd like
to find out about that girl is,

12:20.760 --> 12:24.799
she ever take a little time off
to think about gettin' married?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.112
Well, maybe.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.512
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln
hanging around that's a pretty good catch.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.473
What's he like?

12:33.240 --> 12:37.870
Oh, he's a big merchant,
owner of three stores all bankrupt.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.119
Well, is he handsome?

12:43.360 --> 12:46.591
His pa said that Abe
had been cut out with an axe.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.876
Politician too, I hear.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.558
Yes, he's got less property
and owes more debts

12:52.760 --> 12:54.830
than anybody
ever running for the legislature.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.796
Oh, Abe, you'll do all
right when you get started.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.632
There's something I'd like to start
right now if I thought I could finish it.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.719
You know, Anne, I...

13:11.360 --> 13:13.430
I've always done a lot of dreamin'

13:14.680 --> 13:16.955
and lately it seems when I dream,

13:18.280 --> 13:20.475
your face gets mixed up in it.

13:22.600 --> 13:28.072
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin'

13:29.160 --> 13:35.156
I feel as though I'm going to be
seeing your face till the day I die.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.551
'Course I know that would be pretty hard
for you to have to look at my face that long.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.670
Everybody to their own opinión

13:49.160 --> 13:50.559
Meaning?

13:52.960 --> 13:54.473
I think...

13:54.920 --> 14:00.790
it's the dearest, kindest,
most beautiful face in the whole worid!

14:00.920 --> 14:05.232
Oh, Anne...
Anne...

14:09.800 --> 14:12.792
I know
that's just flattery but I love it.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.712
You know
I feel like little Jimmie Watkins,

14:17.920 --> 14:20.070
he got a hunk of gingerbread
the other day and says:

14:20.320 --> 14:23.437
"I guess there's nobody
likes ginger bread like I does and

14:25.600 --> 14:26.953
gets so little of it".

14:27.760 --> 14:29.273
Oh, Abe!

14:31.840 --> 14:33.193
Anne, will you...

14:34.480 --> 14:35.799
will you marry me?

14:37.320 --> 14:38.799
I mean, of course when I...

14:39.040 --> 14:41.759
when I...
get out of debt and can support you?

14:42.880 --> 14:48.238
Well, you know, Abe,
I've intended to for a long while

14:49.920 --> 14:53.674
that is, of course, if you asked me.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.629
You... you mean?

14:59.040 --> 15:04.034
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.798
Oh, Anne!

15:12.840 --> 15:24.069
Will you think of me and love me-

15:24.920 --> 15:35.034
As you did once long ago?-

15:40.080 --> 15:41.354
How is she, Doctor?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.194
Pretty bad.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.472
She's been asking for you, Abe.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.233
I came as soon as I could.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.833
I had the fever pretty bad myself.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.638
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe,

16:04.360 --> 16:06.078
It's hopeless...

16:08.280 --> 16:09.759
perhaps by tomorrow...

16:11.160 --> 16:12.912
no longer.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.958
I'm so glad you came, Abe.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.037
Are you all right now?

16:48.200 --> 16:51.954
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.

16:54.160 --> 17:00.190
I know the truth, dear.
It's good-bye.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.719
No, no, Anne dear,
you're not going to leave me!

17:05.440 --> 17:06.667
I won't let you!

17:07.440 --> 17:11.115
We must be brave, dear...

17:15.079 --> 17:19.278
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!

17:21.000 --> 17:26.313
It's so dark and lonesome going!

17:26.560 --> 17:29.233
Anne, you mustn't let go!

17:31.760 --> 17:37.118
If they'd sing,
I wouldn't be so afraid.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.189
In the sweet by and by,-

17:46.680 --> 17:52.232
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. -

17:52.520 --> 17:56.559
We will meet there, dear.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.476
Oh... I love you so!

18:01.080 --> 18:04.117
I love you so!

18:42.440 --> 18:43.714
Feeling any better, Bowling?

18:44.400 --> 18:45.833
No, not much.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.432
I'll tell you, Doctor,
he's just like a sick child...

18:49.720 --> 18:52.632
He was lost for five days
before we found him.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.125
Yeh, I know.

18:54.160 --> 18:59.188
We took his pocket-knife away from him,
we were so afeard something might happen.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.077
Good gracious,
Abe, you're looking better!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.672
No use trying to talk to him,

19:18.160 --> 19:19.878
he just cain't answer.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.117
If we could only think of something
that would just bring him back.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.116
I guess time's the only thing.

19:52.160 --> 19:57.109
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud,

19:58.360 --> 20:02.672
like a swift-fleeting meteor,
fast-flying cloud?

20:04.240 --> 20:08.028
Flash of the lightning,
break of the wave,

20:10.720 --> 20:13.837
He passes from life
to his rest in the grave.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.591
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!

20:26.880 --> 20:30.111
He'll be here in a few minutes
the catch of America!

20:30.360 --> 20:32.476
Stephen A. Douglas!

20:33.520 --> 20:35.476
Just think of being his wife!

20:35.800 --> 20:37.279
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.198
I'm not even engaged
much less married.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.598
But if he should propose?

20:43.360 --> 20:46.557
How do I know he's going further
than anyone else in Springfield?

20:47.520 --> 20:50.910
When I pick a husband, sister,
I'll pick a man!

20:51.320 --> 20:52.878
But I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.359
A lot of people seem to think
a man named Abraham Lincoln

20:57.800 --> 20:59.711
is going even further than Mr. Douglas.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.474
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?

21:03.240 --> 21:06.949
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer

21:07.120 --> 21:10.749
with a brilliant cultured gentleman
like Stephen A. Douglas!

21:10.880 --> 21:12.711
Why, if you just saw
the two of them together.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.239
Oh, he's here!

21:14.480 --> 21:17.313
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor
and he's asking for Mary!

21:18.160 --> 21:20.310
Now, Mary, you must be
very careful, and remember

21:20.560 --> 21:22.312
he doesn't like to have giris too bold.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.671
Don't get so excited,
sister, and don't hurry me.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.158
I'll take care of myself.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.997
You glide through the dance
like grace itself Miss Todd.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.959
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!

22:06.680 --> 22:10.593
Who wouldn't be a politician
with so fair a constituent to win?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.557
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.989
No, the fair owner herself.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.913
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas...

23:07.920 --> 23:10.036
I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?

23:10.800 --> 23:11.994
Yes.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.035
Then, pray present me
to this young lady.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.193
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?

23:18.800 --> 23:23.237
May I present one
of the leading lawyers of Springfield

23:24.680 --> 23:26.193
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?

23:27.560 --> 23:28.879
Mr. Lincoln!

23:34.360 --> 23:37.397
Miss Todd I wonder
if you'd honor me with the next dance?

23:38.400 --> 23:41.312
Why,... why...

23:43.880 --> 23:45.552
I'd be delighted.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.230
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny,

23:52.480 --> 23:53.993
and the way I dressed even funnier,

23:54.240 --> 23:55.514
but the joke's on you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.399
Why, I don't understand.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.078
Wait till you dance with me.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.157
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?

24:43.960 --> 24:45.188
Well, she got you.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.148
I knew she would
when she started out the first time for you.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.668
Now, Billie, don't bother me.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.836
I'm going to be married
and I'm scared to death.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.194
Oh, don't be alarmed.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.436
There's many a bite
that's worse than a bride's.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.391
But, Billie,
that woman scares me.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.834
She's even got the ridiculous idea
that I could get to be president.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.956
Oh, don't take that seriously.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.118
Every spunky girl thinks
that her husband ought to be president.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.556
I know, Billie,
but it's a pity to fool her.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.473
And she's a fine woman,

25:17.760 --> 25:19.910
smart as pepper and pretty too.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.878
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln,

25:22.120 --> 25:24.111
but you've got to keep
climbing with her.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.876
Yes... yes, I know.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.036
I've got the best supper
you've ever tasted

25:30.280 --> 25:33.033
and the cake...

25:33.520 --> 25:35.033
wait till you see that cake!

25:35.240 --> 25:37.117
What can have happened
to Mr. Lincoln? It's long after the...

25:37.240 --> 25:39.310
He would be late at his own wedding.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.548
Now, never mind, Mary,

25:41.760 --> 25:44.194
if he doesn't come soon,
I'll send John after him.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.952
But he's hours late already!

25:46.240 --> 25:47.468
Think of that!

25:47.600 --> 25:50.068
Sister, calm yourself.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.191
For heaven's sakes,
you've got to hurry!

25:55.960 --> 25:59.873
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.271
I doubt if there's a word in the
dictionary that could tell how I feel!

26:04.680 --> 26:08.639
Billie, what does a man do
if his head's all right

26:08.840 --> 26:10.319
but his legs are cowardly?

26:10.440 --> 26:11.873
My cure is to get drunk.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.718
My legs are too frightened
to pay any attentión to liquor.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.952
I'll go ahead and
tell them that you're coming.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.474
Anne!

26:37.720 --> 26:38.869
Anne!

26:43.160 --> 26:44.388
Anne!

26:48.880 --> 26:51.474
We looked, everywhere,
tort we can't find him.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.955
No, can't find him...
not at the office.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.639
What on earth happened to him?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.751
He was in a terrible
state when I left him.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.231
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.792
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!

27:06.000 --> 27:07.194
Now sistern dear...

27:07.360 --> 27:08.554
Don't 'sister' me!

27:08.720 --> 27:13.794
Can you imagine! That's what a Todd gets
for engagin' herself to a country baboon!

27:14.040 --> 27:16.554
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!

27:17.200 --> 27:19.236
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!

27:19.560 --> 27:20.788
Not goin' to be any weddin' here.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.558
You can all go home
as far as I'm concerned!

27:23.920 --> 27:25.797
But this is so distressing!

27:30.760 --> 27:32.796
You certainly are a matchmaker

27:33.320 --> 27:36.073
to reconcile those two after
what happened two years ago.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.878
We all like Mr. Lincoln,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.714
and Mary is just
the girl to push him along.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.634
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!

27:44.840 --> 27:46.034
What a lovely dress!

27:46.240 --> 27:48.470
Yes, and so becoming to her too.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.718
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.870
Julia it all seems so strange
having things end this way.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.437
It's just as it should end. You and
Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.351
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.114
Good morning.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.919
Come, my dear
we'll leave the happy pair alone.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.389
Good morning, Mary.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.396
I,... I...

28:22.240 --> 28:25.630
Mary, you don't have
to bother about me any more.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.036
I think I've settled down at last.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.192
I hope I can make
your future all you desire.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.795
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.

28:35.880 --> 28:39.111
I really think, after all, you need me.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.119
You'll need a lot of patience
to put up with me, Mary,

28:46.200 --> 28:49.909
but if anyone can do it,
I'm sure you're the one.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.388
Oh, Mary!

29:30.920 --> 29:33.150
Douglas is a prize speaker,

29:33.360 --> 29:37.035
but just wait till old Abe
gets ahold of him on slavery!

29:37.360 --> 29:38.634
You're crazy!

29:38.760 --> 29:42.673
Lincoln has no more chance of beating
Douglas for Senate than I have.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.556
He only went to school for three months.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.192
There must be no issue of slavery.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.873
We must face the facts.

30:20.600 --> 30:26.596
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.391
I will not throw mud.

30:41.520 --> 30:49.234
Let each State mind its own business
and this Republic can exist forever...

30:50.000 --> 30:54.551
divided into free and slave states.

31:06.280 --> 31:11.957
We will not allow
the extensión of slavery to any State.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.713
We will not allow
the secessión of any State.

31:21.440 --> 31:29.074
Above all and before all,
the Unión must be preserved.

31:34.920 --> 31:39.596
A house divided
against itself must fall!

31:49.160 --> 31:52.755
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

31:53.080 --> 31:56.755
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

31:57.480 --> 32:04.670
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

32:19.040 --> 32:20.189
Mary...

32:28.840 --> 32:30.239
I'm home, Mary.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.070
You must be tired, Mr, Lincoln.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.754
Sit down.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.591
You just ait right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.513
Billy, I feel like
the little boy who stubbed his toe.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.478
It hurt too bad to laugh,
and he was too big to cry.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.992
I'm fifty years old, Billy,
and a failure in everything.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.593
If I died today,
nobody'd ever know I'd lived.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.074
Come in.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.513
Mr. Lincoln,
I want you to meet Mr. Pell

33:39.960 --> 33:43.157
one of the most important
men in Eastern politics.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.673
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- I'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.434
- Meet my partner, Mr, Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?

33:49.560 --> 33:50.709
Happy to meet you, sir.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.076
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.

33:53.800 --> 33:58.271
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against
Douglas has made you a national figure.

33:59.160 --> 34:03.119
I'm here to ask you if you will consider
being the Republican party's candidate

34:03.520 --> 34:05.078
for the presidency.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.033
Did you say a failure in everything?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.431
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.714
Mr. Lincoln, you know
ever since John Brown's raid,

34:32.520 --> 34:35.795
the South has been infuriated,
the East on the verge of revolt,

34:35.920 --> 34:38.275
and now New York
threatens to quit the Unión.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.271
No, no New York mustn't do that.

34:40.760 --> 34:44.435
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secessión.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.155
The Unión must be preserved.

34:49.600 --> 34:54.799
The crisis is at hand, Mr. Lincoln,
and we believe you are the man.

35:00.120 --> 35:04.398
Gentlemen,
I feel deeply grateful.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.552
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home,
you won't get no supper.

35:10.240 --> 35:15.394
"I have another crisis; the soup and
the country are boiling over together!"

35:15.760 --> 35:17.318
Maw's boiling too!

35:21.120 --> 35:23.315
It needs deep consideratión.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.989
Well, Mr. Lincoln,
mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.836
- I'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.152
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.272
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!

35:57.400 --> 35:59.152
This darkio saw it himself.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.878
Brown and a gang of Abolxitionists
have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!

36:04.400 --> 36:07.358
They're arming the slaves
to rise up and murder us all.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.160
They gived us all rifles.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.594
And what'd you do with yours?

36:11.800 --> 36:17.796
What'd I do? I trowed it down,
and I say, 'Feet, you travel'

36:18.120 --> 36:20.998
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!

36:21.200 --> 36:23.760
Boys, go home and git your guns.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.154
What's all this talk about guns?

36:25.320 --> 36:26.958
This thing has gone far enough.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.913
We'll be murdered
in our beds by our own slaves.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.356
Pardon me, ladies,
while I find out about this desecratión.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.869
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!

36:36.080 --> 36:37.229
It's an outrage!

36:37.360 --> 36:39.271
Outrage isn't the word.

36:40.360 --> 36:46.754
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist
who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.273
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.750
He can't act
but the women don't know it.

36:53.080 --> 36:57.392
All right, men, get your guns
and we'll meet at the square!

36:57.800 --> 37:01.270
At the square!

37:34.840 --> 37:36.796
Can't say much for her dispositión!

37:37.040 --> 37:38.393
Hush! She may hear you.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.949
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.430
Here you no, the stupid-looking one

37:43.640 --> 37:46.598
put that over there...
and you... idiot

37:46.760 --> 37:49.194
don't look at me like
a duck in a thunderstorm!

37:50.640 --> 37:52.710
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?

37:53.240 --> 37:55.276
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.194
And as for you with the whiskers,
I told you to put it in there.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.638
Oh, is it going to take forever?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.231
Thank heavens, that's the last!

38:08.280 --> 38:09.554
Imbeciles!

38:10.440 --> 38:11.839
Well, Mary, we're here.

38:12.160 --> 38:15.869
Thanks to me! If it wasn't for my advice,
you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.510
Yes, you're always right, Mary.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.315
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.709
Servants here are no better
than they are in Springfield.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.034
This place
hasn't been cleaned in a year.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.070
Why, Mr. President!

38:44.320 --> 38:45.548
Huh?

38:51.880 --> 38:55.919
Then we agree that the situatión
of our country is ominous.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.991
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.789
We agree that we must yield
to the demands of the South

39:02.840 --> 39:05.479
and evacuate Fort Sumter.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.231
- Absolutely.
- It's the only solutión.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.799
That must be done.

39:09.880 --> 39:14.271
We agree that our President
must be firmly guided by us.

39:15.920 --> 39:21.472
That we must make every effort
to control his inexperienced judgment.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.556
- We certainly must.
- Yes.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.634
Gentlemen...

39:32.760 --> 39:34.716
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.154
Thank you, Hay.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.873
Thank you, gentlemen...

40:17.240 --> 40:25.796
I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.198
That means war.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.552
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace,

40:36.160 --> 40:39.277
but the Unión shall be preserved.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.877
Seventy-five thousand...

41:10.560 --> 41:13.233
It might be difficult
to get that many volunteers.

42:13.520 --> 42:21.518
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

42:21.880 --> 42:29.878
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
- His soul is marching on!-

42:31.000 --> 42:38.759
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

42:39.240 --> 42:42.710
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

42:55.880 --> 42:59.634
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-

42:59.840 --> 43:03.515
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -

43:03.760 --> 43:11.599
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -

43:28.160 --> 43:31.869
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-

43:32.120 --> 43:36.033
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -

43:36.240 --> 43:43.590
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -

43:57.360 --> 44:02.388
President, the people demand a victory,
and we've got to take Richmond.

44:10.760 --> 44:14.196
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.268
That reminds me of a story...

44:17.760 --> 44:20.479
about a man building
a boat to cross a river.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.311
He got impatient
building the boat and started swimming.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.473
Well, sir, what happened?

44:28.600 --> 44:29.794
He drowned.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.468
We've got to be careful
not to drown this country.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.798
Ready here!
Ready here!

44:48.160 --> 44:49.434
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.039
Ready here!
Ready here!

44:54.000 --> 44:56.150
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.791
- How did you make out?
- Make out?

45:01.120 --> 45:02.553
He darned near kissed me.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.238
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.472
We're just licking
the tar out of thorn all along the line.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.314
- Who's next?
- I am.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.318
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face

45:12.480 --> 45:13.754
when he gets the good news.

45:13.920 --> 45:17.390
Ready here! Commissary.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.831
For General Scott.
Marked private.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.348
Rush it it's victory!

45:27.280 --> 45:28.872
General Scott, what news?

45:29.200 --> 45:31.350
We're winning, sir. I'm sure of it.

45:32.040 --> 45:35.430
- I wish...
- Come in.

45:43.600 --> 45:46.433
Rebel resistance broken at Bulll Run,-

45:46.920 --> 45:50.356
our army sweeping everything before it. -

45:52.440 --> 45:56.274
President, if we can
capture Richmond now,

45:56.520 --> 45:58.431
it means the end of the war.

45:58.600 --> 46:01.353
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir...

46:01.960 --> 46:05.555
this victory will silence
your enemies forever

46:06.080 --> 46:09.595
and you will be
the greatest president in our history.

46:09.760 --> 46:13.036
It doesn't matter
what they think of me, General.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.112
- We will have saved the Unión.
- Yes.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.795
General, would you mind
letting me have that telegram?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.950
I'd like to show it
to Mrs. Lincoln myself.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.549
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.

46:28.520 --> 46:32.115
And would you mind
not calling me 'Mr. President'..

46:33.080 --> 46:34.513
just Lincoln.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.715
All right, Lincoln.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.354
Ready here!
Headquarters!

46:48.760 --> 46:50.990
Sergeant, all messages
for General Scott, hold.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.798
All messages for General Scott hold.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.997
All messages for General Scott hold.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.669
Attentión! Commanding officer.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.354
At ease!

47:03.520 --> 47:04.714
Ready here!

47:05.920 --> 47:08.229
Bad news?
Give it to me.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.471
Attentión the President!

47:18.280 --> 47:19.474
At ease!

47:20.000 --> 47:22.150
Well, General, what news now?

47:24.160 --> 47:25.912
And the first reports?

47:28.040 --> 47:29.871
Over-confidence.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.911
Yes, I should have known.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.555
Impossible to reform lines. -

47:49.600 --> 47:51.591
The men are a confused mob,-

47:52.120 --> 47:53.917
entirely demoralized. -

47:54.520 --> 47:58.399
You must make every effort
to save Washington.

48:15.040 --> 48:16.268
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

48:16.440 --> 48:17.714
- ¡3!
- ¡4!

48:17.800 --> 48:18.869
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

48:19.000 --> 48:20.194
- ¡3!
- ¡4!

48:20.320 --> 48:21.469
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

48:21.600 --> 48:22.794
- ¡3!
- ¡4!

48:23.000 --> 48:24.228
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

48:24.600 --> 48:25.953
Battalion!

48:26.520 --> 48:27.873
On right into line, March!

48:28.080 --> 48:29.354
Company, halt!

48:29.640 --> 48:30.914
Left turn!

48:31.440 --> 48:34.079
Right turn!

48:34.440 --> 48:35.634
Halt!

48:38.080 --> 48:41.197
First Company, right by fours.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.394
Halt!

48:47.800 --> 48:49.153
Forward!

48:49.360 --> 48:50.360
Halt!

48:50.400 --> 48:51.958
Forward!

49:16.760 --> 49:18.751
Well, they're gathering.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.754
The reserves are gathering, sir.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.474
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.317
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.392
Can we hold Washington?

49:35.720 --> 49:36.994
We'll do our best sir.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.479
Mr. Hay, is it true
we have to get out of Washington?

49:46.600 --> 49:47.794
It is very serious, madam.

49:48.040 --> 49:50.600
For heaven's sake,
what sort of an army have we anyhow?

49:50.800 --> 49:52.392
They did the best
they could, Mrs. Lincoln.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.913
They might have considered us.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.996
It'll take forever
to get those trunks packed.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.879
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.113
Mr. Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.996
Just a moment, Mary, please.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.869
After all the trouble we had getting here,

50:13.160 --> 50:16.118
I must say we've had a very short stay.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.635
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here,

50:21.760 --> 50:24.718
and here it stays till
they knock it off with a bayonet.

50:27.280 --> 50:31.717
From now on, Mary,
I'm going to run this war.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.955
March! Halt!

50:43.200 --> 50:44.952
Headquarters,
Post Number Four.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.393
Halt! Guard.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.432
Forward March!

51:00.240 --> 51:01.719
Counsel of the accused,

51:02.160 --> 51:04.628
have you nothing further
to say in defense of the prisoner?

51:05.280 --> 51:10.035
The court finds you guilty
and the sentence death.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.389
- Just a minute.
- The President... attentión!

51:25.240 --> 51:27.515
You must pardon me,
gentlemen, for this intrusión.

51:29.840 --> 51:33.071
I overheard one of our soldiers
sentenced to death.

51:33.280 --> 51:37.239
Yes, Mr. President.
A bad example of cowardice and desertión.

51:39.840 --> 51:43.594
Well, young man, tell me about it.

51:46.280 --> 51:49.955
I think the findings
of the court were just, sir.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.592
That all you have to say?

51:54.920 --> 51:58.390
Sire, it was our first big battle.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.316
We were trying to take a stone wall.

52:02.280 --> 52:04.350
We'd been trying,
it seems, for years...

52:04.520 --> 52:05.748
Go on.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.960
Finally, though, we got there.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.714
I was fighting bayonets.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.079
We were all crazy...

52:15.840 --> 52:17.193
on top of the wall...

52:18.080 --> 52:19.229
Yes?

52:19.880 --> 52:24.670
There was my boyhood chum,
looking up at me from the ground.

52:26.200 --> 52:32.389
Not alive,
we had killed him a long time ago,

52:32.920 --> 52:35.195
but I knew him.

52:35.760 --> 52:36.954
And then?

52:37.920 --> 52:40.957
I guess I went really crazy, sir.

52:43.480 --> 52:44.629
That's all.

52:44.880 --> 52:47.189
The captain reports
that you threw your rifle away.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.638
Yes, sir. That must be right, sir.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.037
Making excuses, Colton?

52:53.280 --> 52:54.713
No, sir only...

52:55.600 --> 52:57.192
get it over with, quick!

53:02.000 --> 53:08.872
Hanging, killing, blood.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.314
I'm tired.

53:25.400 --> 53:29.188
But my generals are right,
we must maintain discipline.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.869
That's all.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.668
Wait a minute.

53:37.400 --> 53:38.628
Bring that young man back.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.034
I have it!

53:45.280 --> 53:48.158
- It's a leg case.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

53:48.920 --> 53:50.831
Leg case... yes, yes,

53:50.960 --> 53:55.192
my shelves are full of them,
but not quite like this one.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.989
If the Lord Almighty
gives a man a cowardly pair of legs,

54:01.520 --> 54:02.873
and that man gets frightened,

54:04.240 --> 54:07.073
he can't help his legs
running away with him, can he?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.951
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.871
Go back and do your duty.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.390
Oh, I will, sir! I will!

54:25.640 --> 54:26.993
I'm trusting you.

54:32.760 --> 54:34.034
Well, Senator?

54:35.760 --> 54:39.230
Mr. President, my state of New York

54:39.480 --> 54:42.074
is crying out
against this endless slaughter.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.713
And mine, sir.

54:47.080 --> 54:51.631
They're holding services here today
for those who were sacrificed,

54:53.200 --> 54:54.713
as they are everywhere.

54:55.200 --> 54:57.350
From the East to the West, sir.

54:57.600 --> 54:58.919
It can't go on, sir.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.275
New England,the West,

55:03.840 --> 55:08.960
the entire country are in mourning
for this useless waste of lives.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.994
Let the Southern States
go there wat, Mr. President,

55:15.600 --> 55:16.669
and we will go ours.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.638
But I tell you, Mr. President...

55:18.960 --> 55:22.555
- ... out of the wilderness,-
- out of the wilderness. -

55:22.800 --> 55:26.759
- Old Abe Lincoln-
- came out of the wilderness,-

55:27.000 --> 55:29.912
down in lllinois. -

55:31.200 --> 55:34.645
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.

55:34.680 --> 55:37.319
She wants me to go to bed,
and I don't want to.

55:37.520 --> 55:40.830
Don't you think it's time
for little boys to be in bed, Tad?

55:41.280 --> 55:44.317
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?

55:44.480 --> 55:47.552
If you say so, she can't make me.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.159
You're the President.

55:50.480 --> 55:55.315
You're the only person in the country
who thinks I should have any authority.

56:01.160 --> 56:03.037
- Run along now.
- No.

56:03.320 --> 56:07.313
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't I, daddy?

56:07.680 --> 56:11.798
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.719
All right, daddy.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.512
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

56:20.680 --> 56:22.079
Sleep tight.

56:22.440 --> 56:23.589
Goodnight...

56:31.600 --> 56:34.558
Gentlemen,
don't you suppose my heart bleeds

56:34.760 --> 56:37.718
for all the sorrows
this war has brought upon us?

56:38.960 --> 56:43.431
Do you suppose there is a human being
who wants peace more than I do.

56:44.920 --> 56:47.229
But we want lasting peace,

56:48.880 --> 56:52.793
and we can have that only
by preserving the Unión.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.593
And, gentlemen...

57:04.800 --> 57:07.553
the Unión is going to be preserved!

57:13.080 --> 57:17.631
- And by virtue of the power,-
- and for the purpose aforesaid,-

57:18.520 --> 57:22.638
- I do order and declare-
- that all persons held as slaves -

57:22.880 --> 57:26.555
- within said designated states-
- and parts of states-

57:27.400 --> 57:30.676
- are henceforward-
- and forever shall be... -

57:31.240 --> 57:32.389
free. -

57:48.240 --> 57:52.916
Well, gentlemen, it is done.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.476
- More bad news, Hay?
- I'm afraid there is.

58:13.600 --> 58:14.749
Well, let's have it.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.115
The Secret Service
reports that there are 600.000

58:17.520 --> 58:19.795
pperheads in the North and under cath and arme

58:19.960 --> 58:21.279
- To get me?
- Yes.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.192
That many ought
to keep me dodging.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.590
We're taking
every precautión to guard you.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.673
Where are they mostly?

58:30.520 --> 58:34.274
Ohio has one 100.000 armed men
ready to rise up and depose you.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.551
lllionois, 135.000.

58:36.720 --> 58:41.475
lllinois,
my old stamping ground...

58:43.480 --> 58:48.554
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.

58:48.720 --> 58:51.871
But Mr. President,
we are worried about you.

58:52.920 --> 58:57.232
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.955
Lincoln, come on to bed.

59:29.280 --> 59:30.679
I'm worried, Mary.

59:31.640 --> 59:35.633
You can't win this war worrying and
walking around in your stocking feet.

59:36.480 --> 59:37.799
I can't sleep.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.953
Neither can I. At least we could sleep
in Springfield, couldn't we?

59:45.600 --> 59:48.831
Did we ever sleep?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.556
Now, stand still.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.478
I've got it, Mary.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.118
I've found the man to win this war

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.995
and his name is Grant.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.554
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking
is one of my most persistent habits.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.149
And winning victories is another.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.908
Thank you.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.311
Then you do believe in me, Sir?

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.833
I sent for you.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.758
General, the North is desperate.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.432
We need you.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.229
And, should I assume command,
there will be no interference?

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.874
None. I promise you that.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.228
Grant,...

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.919
Lieutenant-General is
the highest army command

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.872
the President can bestow.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.198
We haven't had one
since General Washington.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.719
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.398
Lieutenant-General Grant,...

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.075
my orders are: Win the War.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.113
I'll give my best, Mr. President.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.512
I know you will.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.116
Unfortunately many of us
have failed to recognize

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.714
a great Confederate Soldier.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.919
Lee.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.074
On the other hand, we have thus far

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.791
failed to take advantage
of a great Northern Soldier.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.878
I hope I am not too late
in correcting the error.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.389
Mr. President,
I think it only fair to warn you

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.635
that many people, don't approve of me.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.273
Nor of me.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.550
But rest assured
there will be no interference,

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.512
no intrusión.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.432
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.794
My wife!

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.479
All right, Mary.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.632
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.839
Mary, meet General Grant. Mrs. Lincoln.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.638
- It's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.157
- I want to talk to you. Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we...

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.551
I want to talk to you about discharging
some of the servants in this house.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.790
I don't see how anybody
could talk in here with all this smoke.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.112
Why don't you open the window?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.749
I can't stand it!

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.799
Pardon me, General.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.318
I'll have to talk to you later.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.671
- I'm very sorry if...
- There no apoligies, General.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.718
You've given me an idea.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.396
I may take up smoking myself.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.558
But to resume, General.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.270
We will give you
all the help you need.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.510
Every man capable
of bearing arms shall go.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.315
We've got to win this war.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.635
It is a duty we owe
the South as well as the North.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.598
It's a big job, Mr. President...
a big job.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.555
but thy will be done.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.793
Thy will be done.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.958
We're in a tight place now.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.431
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.240
Everything depends upon Sheridan.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.198
He's a fighting Irishman.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.078
Then why doesn't he fight?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.390
- One división Sheridan's -
- army routed. -

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.669
Now trying to hold left flank. -

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.479
Oh, the blood it takes
to hold this Unión together.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.716
It will undo everything
Grant has done. It's hopeless.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.633
I don't think so...

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.072
Before each victory I've had
a visión of a ship with white sails.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.556
That visión has just conic to me.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.674
With all respect,
I'd rather trade your ship

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.236
for good news from Sheridan.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.476
Is that General Sheridan in there?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.998
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.512
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.397
I don't hear anything, sir.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.033
Hey, come here.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.045
Have you good ears?

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.718
Pretty good when they're washed.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.034
Then try them.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.752
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.877
It's cannon all right,
over by the swamp.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.997
They may have caught
General Wright by surprise!

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.069
Mount those shorses!

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.194
- Sheridan's entire army-
- has met an overwhelming defeat. -

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.594
Incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.912
I'm afraid he was away.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.992
It means the defeat of all our plans.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.553
Yes, for we'll have
to withdraw Grant from Richmond

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.117
to protect Washington.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.199
Come on, boys! Come on!

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.310
General,
the right wing is in full retreat.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.874
Impossible to hold our positión, sir.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.788
Tell Colonel Tolliver
to reform and hold at all costs.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.113
We're going back!

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.399
Officers, reform your men!

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.953
We're going back!

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.559
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.230
Forward!
Forward to victory!

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.116
- Down with, the traitor,-
- up with the star!-

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.231
- While we rally-
- 'round the flag boys,-

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.118
- We'll rally-
- once again,-

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.478
shouting the battle cry of freedom!-

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.918
Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.832
We'll rally once again,-

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.710
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.795
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain. -

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.829
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.359
- The Unión forever,-
- hurrah, boys, hurrah!-

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.996
- Sown with the traitor,-
- up with the star. -

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.315
While we rally round the flag boys,-

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.391
We'll rally once again,-

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.116
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.828
Arrived in time to reform forces. -

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.918
Have struck the enemy-

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.150
- and have won an
overwhelming victory. Sheridan. -

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.748
I knew it.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.148
I knew it...

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.670
Better and better. Look! Here.
Tremendous number of prisoners.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.879
Prisoners?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.878
I hope there's nothing
but prisoners from now on.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.956
The ship, Stanton!

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.952
Yes, Mr. President,

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.279
and Sheridan!

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.313
Surrender...

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.711
my poor army!

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.311
I'd rather die a thousand deaths
than do that to them.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.309
There, General,
you must lie down and rest.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.194
Rest...

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.117
that's a beautiful word...

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.639
They've caught a spy and they want
the order for his executión approved.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.469
Colonel Marshall...

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.114
who was that?

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.959
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.152
They've caught a spy.
I approved the executión order, sir.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.874
Colonel,...

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.795
the only reason for shooting a spy
is the protectión of an army, isn't it?

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.428
Yes, sir.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.919
Well,...

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.516
you and I know
that this army can't exist much longer.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.954
Isn't that right?

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.714
Yes, sir.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.114
That is why I am unwilling
that there shall be a single life lost

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.193
unnecessarily.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.908
Colonel...

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.239
I wonder if you'd mind
countermanding that order.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.554
I will.
Yes, sir.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.359
Tired, Grant?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.479
Not much.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.357
Mr. President, we have them.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.033
It can only last a few days more.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.551
General Sherman and I are glad
of this chance to talk with you.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.673
The Unión...
we've saved it at last.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.912
They must surrender soon.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.308
The Unión...

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.397
We'll have 'em all back...

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.115
United, free...
one Country.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.558
And meanwhile, Mr. President?

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.838
I've heard the country
wishes all rebel property confiscated

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.755
and the rebel generals,
such as Lee, shot for treason.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.070
He's put up a grand battle.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.397
And they've robbed
the cradle and the grave, sir.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.477
Lee is fighting with his last breath.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.392
Shoot Robert E. Lee?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.398
Someone will have to shoot
Abraham Lincoln first.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.555
They're rebels, not traitors.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.428
And their horses and baggage, sir?

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.195
They'll need them
for the spring plowing.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.112
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.759
Very good, sir.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.194
Just one thing more, Mr. President...

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.794
the head of the rebel government
Jefferson Davis?

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.954
Jefferson Davis...

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.232
Do you wish his capture?

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.555
That reminds me of a story.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.557
We had a terrible drunkard once

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.954
in Springfield.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.590
Finally he signed the pledge.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.238
Next day he got thirsty

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.709
and went to a bar
and ordered a lemonade.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.276
While the bartender was fixing it,
the old drunk got sadder and sadder.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.955
Finally he leaned over
and said to the bartender,

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.791
"Mike, while you're fixin' that,

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.071
couldn't you put
a nice little shot of whiskey in,

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.958
unbeknownst to meself?"

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.919
Well, sir?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.309
Couldn't you sort
of lot Jeff Davis escape,

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.472
unbeknownst to yourselves?

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.513
We'll do our part, sir.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.468
We're going to take them back
as though they'd never been away.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.353
Lincoln...

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.392
He freed the negroes.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.392
He's supressed
the right of a trail by jury.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.353
He muzzled the press!

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.949
Now, wiht the oid of this "butternuts",

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.995
his army and his negroes,
he make himself

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.559
King of the América.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.194
Lincoln!

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.879
I drink to him...

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.879
and his domatión!

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.753
Right,...

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.439
you're right.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.798
On my part...

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.197
Go on,
you're among friends...

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.272
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.311
will be inmortal.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.473
Now, listen...

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.113
I have a plan...

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.954
and I'm going in.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.314
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.756
No, not much.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.396
You don't know how glad we all are
that you were reelected, Mr. President.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.399
I'm sure this lady will be glad

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.153
to spend four more years
in the White House.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.669
Glad? I've just hired two new maids.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.550
Lincoln, will you ever learn
to keep your feet in shoes?

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.196
Mrs. Lincoln,
have you met General Grant?

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.716
I met him. It took us a week
to get the smoke out of the curtains.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.349
Yes, Oglesby, he's one
human being who has faults.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.960
A party of prohibitionists,
called on me the other day

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.958
and complained about Grant's drinking.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.639
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses,

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.115
I'd send barrels of it
to my other generals.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.031
Two new maids...

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.994
If we're going to be
here four more years...

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.319
Four years...
four more years...

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.797
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking
about of those dreams again.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.433
You'll live two hundred and after
we'll celebrate it right over here,

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.193
we'll travel around the worid
and have a nice long rest.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.989
Oh, Daddy!,
Would that be fun?

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.875
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.077
You can depend on Mother Surratt,
and everything is straight with me.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.719
I said I'd go through with it,
and I will.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.115
Tonight will be remembered
throughout the ages.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.432
I play my best part.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.795
How much better a dagger would look,

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.556
Cassius used a dagger,

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.358
but this is safer.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.318
- Speech!
- Speech!

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:45.955
- Speech!
- Speech!

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.870
Again I say,

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.035
with malice toward none,

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.715
with charity for all,

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.877
with firmness in the right

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.594
as God gives us to see the right,

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:19.151
we shall bind up
the natión's wounds and cherish peace.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:31.274
That government of the people,
by the people, for the people

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.397
shall not perish from the earth.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.069
Thank you.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.639
God bless you all.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.477
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.118
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.713
Will you be long, sir?

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.952
No, not very long.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.032
Dundreary,
would you mind bringing me a wrap?

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.919
I feel a draught.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.999
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.159
Mr. Lincoln...

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.796
has just stopped the draft.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.958
I reckon I'm going
to feel right to home here, b'gosh!

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.078
I would be too if it wasn't for
that 'ternal servant-critter

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.675
with brass buttons on his coat.

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.431
He just swells out his big bosom
like a turkey cock in layin' time,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.754
looks at me as if I meant
to esquatulate with the spoons.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.758
I reckon they don't know who they're
dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.637
I'm as obstinate
as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.035
"It wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up,"

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.557
wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.478
I don't know what
they're going to do with me,

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.715
but whatever they do do
and wherever they put me,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.275
I hope it's outa
the reach of that jackass.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.512
I'm a real hoss, I am,

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.194
and I get kinda riley with them critters.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.872
They say I don't know
the manners of good society too,

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.029
but I guess I know enough
to turn that old gal inside out,

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.470
the sock-dollaging old mantrap.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.958
But I dare no more kill her

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.117
than I dare ask Queen Victoria

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.914
to dance a Cape Cod reel.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.596
Sic semper tyrannis!

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.398
Mr. Lincoln,
Mr. Lincoln has been shot!

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.278
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:24.839
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:34.196
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:43.112
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:53.759
His soul is marching on!-

01:29:54.305 --> 01:30:00.922
