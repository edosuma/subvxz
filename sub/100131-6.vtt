00:01.585 --> 00:04.546
<i>I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.</i>

00:07.049 --> 00:09.092
Nyrie!

00:09.593 --> 00:11.011
<i>What have you brought me?</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:13.096
I will speak to you.
You've made a mistake--

00:14.348 --> 00:17.226
I wonder who you might be
to make such a claim.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.020
<i>Opayol.
They're the ones who took our things.</i>

00:20.103 --> 00:22.272
<i>There's no one down there.
It looks deserted.</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:26.902
Stop! Feel! His chest.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.403
He can see.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.822
Boots is Jerlamarel's son. Our brother.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.949
Where's Mama? What happened?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.075
They took her?

00:33.158 --> 00:35.536
No, she let go of my hand.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.620
Tamacti Jun!

00:38.747 --> 00:40.082
Princess Maghra...

00:40.332 --> 00:42.668
of the House of Kane.

01:39.970 --> 01:40.971
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

01:48.062 --> 01:49.146
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

02:22.096 --> 02:23.305
Maghra!

02:37.278 --> 02:38.279
Here I am.

02:44.118 --> 02:45.411
Dad. Dad.

02:45.911 --> 02:46.829
Boy.

02:46.912 --> 02:48.998
There's more of them coming.
We're about to be surrounded.

02:49.623 --> 02:50.958
-Dad.
-What happened?

02:51.041 --> 02:52.042
What happened?

02:52.126 --> 02:54.754
I didn't see it,
but he said he saw it, and--

02:54.837 --> 02:56.213
-Saw what?
-Saw what?

02:56.297 --> 02:58.132
What-- What's she talking about?

02:58.214 --> 02:59.216
Did you find Mom?

02:59.300 --> 03:00.885
I saw her leave the woods.

03:00.968 --> 03:02.553
I saw her with them and...

03:03.387 --> 03:04.597
I saw her die.

03:06.849 --> 03:08.434
What? What?

03:08.517 --> 03:10.561
She was taken before their leader.

03:11.145 --> 03:12.146
She pled with him.

03:12.229 --> 03:14.899
He seemed to be listening, but then
he drew for his sword and he cut her down.

03:14.982 --> 03:16.942
He-- He killed her.

03:17.026 --> 03:19.195
No. No. She's not dead.

03:21.822 --> 03:23.115
-He's lying.
-No.

03:23.866 --> 03:25.242
Why should I believe him?

03:25.659 --> 03:27.495
I didn't believe it either.

03:28.079 --> 03:29.622
I went to look for her.

03:30.581 --> 03:31.916
And I found this.

03:33.334 --> 03:35.628
-I found her bag in blood.
-What?

03:35.711 --> 03:37.755
I saw it with my own eyes.

03:38.422 --> 03:40.091
I'm sorry, but we have to run.

03:40.174 --> 03:43.219
No, no. I'm not running.

03:44.136 --> 03:47.098
I'm not going anywhere until we find
the Witchfinder and kill him.

03:47.181 --> 03:48.682
-No.
-Papa.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.184
We run.

03:50.726 --> 03:52.853
-What?
-There will be another time,

03:52.937 --> 03:55.648
a time of our choosing,
but right now I have to keep you safe.

03:55.731 --> 03:57.733
-No. I'll go without--
-Listen to me.

03:58.818 --> 04:01.612
I have to keep you safe.

04:01.695 --> 04:04.281
We must go.
We must go. They're on their way.

04:04.365 --> 04:05.991
I know a place we can hide safely.

04:06.075 --> 04:07.118
Follow me.

04:44.864 --> 04:47.575
You were dead and now you are not.

04:48.242 --> 04:49.785
How can this be?

04:49.869 --> 04:51.162
Where's my family?

04:51.245 --> 04:54.832
These children with vision,
they are yours...

04:56.834 --> 04:58.502
aren't they?

04:58.586 --> 05:01.255
I'll answer nothing
until I have your assurance

05:01.338 --> 05:03.424
that my family will not be harmed.

05:04.008 --> 05:07.053
I have orders to seize them
by any means necessary.

05:07.135 --> 05:09.555
I'm giving you different orders then,
aren't I?

05:09.638 --> 05:11.348
You are not the queen.

05:13.184 --> 05:14.560
And whose fault is that?

05:16.604 --> 05:20.191
Tell your men to bring them in alive
and unharmed,

05:20.274 --> 05:22.234
and I'll tell you what you want to know.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.571
And then I'll tell you more.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.043
General.

05:39.126 --> 05:42.963
Pass word into the field,
the fugitives must be caught alive.

05:43.047 --> 05:47.802
Any damage visited upon them will be
returned to every tenth man of ours,

05:47.885 --> 05:49.512
drawn by lots.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.389
Do you understand?

05:52.431 --> 05:53.641
Yes, General.

05:58.646 --> 06:02.191
The order has been given, as you asked.

06:03.317 --> 06:07.196
Now, will you answer my question?

06:17.957 --> 06:19.375
There was a time...

06:21.627 --> 06:23.587
had I given you my word...

06:24.588 --> 06:26.549
you would not have
hesitated to believe it.

06:28.259 --> 06:30.177
That was a long time ago.

06:31.137 --> 06:32.346
Yes, it was.

06:34.682 --> 06:36.851
But we are who we are.

06:37.518 --> 06:39.812
No amount of time could change that.

06:41.647 --> 06:45.651
If you trusted me then, do it again now.

06:48.863 --> 06:50.156
Please...

06:52.158 --> 06:53.909
tell me what happened.

06:59.582 --> 07:00.791
This way.

07:09.884 --> 07:11.260
Where are we?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.679
It's a cave, well hidden.

07:13.763 --> 07:15.389
I used to play inside as a child.

07:15.473 --> 07:18.684
It's deep and dark.
Nobody will find us here.

07:51.008 --> 07:52.343
The air is still here.

07:56.639 --> 07:58.766
-It's a dead end.
-It's all right. We've arrived.

07:59.183 --> 08:00.184
Boots!

08:01.352 --> 08:02.561
What are you doing?

08:04.563 --> 08:06.315
-Open the gate.
-Can't.

08:07.858 --> 08:08.901
Boots.

08:10.277 --> 08:13.114
Listen to me. Open this gate.

08:14.198 --> 08:15.658
Please don't leave us in here.

08:19.870 --> 08:21.205
Please stop.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.210
Why are you doing this?

08:26.961 --> 08:29.964
We took you in.
I told them to take you in.

08:30.047 --> 08:31.716
It is better this way.

08:32.049 --> 08:34.301
Too many of you to trust all of you.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.470
One would be better.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.848
-Goodbye.
-Boy.

08:38.931 --> 08:40.558
-No.
-Boy!

08:40.641 --> 08:42.268
-Open the gate.
-Hey!

08:42.768 --> 08:43.978
Open the gate.

08:44.478 --> 08:45.730
Open this gate!

08:46.647 --> 08:47.940
Open this gate!

08:49.108 --> 08:50.568
-Boots!
-Open the gate!

08:51.527 --> 08:52.653
Boots!

08:58.159 --> 09:00.661
-It's not. This can't be happening.
-I knew this would happen.

09:01.495 --> 09:04.373
You never wanted to listen.
Nobody wanted to listen.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.710
We told you not to do it.

09:12.006 --> 09:13.507
-What did you say?
-She heard me.

09:13.591 --> 09:14.508
Kofun!

09:14.592 --> 09:16.594
We told you not to go inland.

09:16.677 --> 09:20.765
We told you not to trust him.
But since when has that ever mattered?

09:21.473 --> 09:23.851
You're always so fucking certain
you're in the right!

09:23.934 --> 09:26.020
Well, look where it's left us now, Haniwa!

09:27.938 --> 09:29.148
Fuck.

09:37.948 --> 09:38.991
What is it?

09:39.950 --> 09:41.160
It's dropping.

09:50.002 --> 09:51.170
Kofun.

09:52.254 --> 09:54.673
When we get to the bottom,
we're gonna be in the dark.

09:55.091 --> 09:59.595
I have a flint.
I just-- I need something to light.

10:02.098 --> 10:03.099
The letter.

10:31.627 --> 10:33.879
If this cage can be lowered,
it can be raised.

10:34.296 --> 10:36.590
Do you see any tools we can use to do it?

10:40.386 --> 10:41.595
I don't think so.

10:44.306 --> 10:45.516
Someone's here.

10:48.144 --> 10:49.353
I don't see anyone.

10:54.817 --> 10:56.068
We can't stay here.

10:57.987 --> 11:01.282
If we can't get out the way we came,
we have to find a way through this.

11:02.366 --> 11:04.410
We're gonna be in the dark again soon.

11:05.369 --> 11:06.620
Then follow me.

12:13.229 --> 12:14.438
What are you doing?

12:15.981 --> 12:17.108
What do you care?

12:17.191 --> 12:18.818
You've stopped working.

12:18.901 --> 12:21.195
They will notice, and you don't want that.

12:24.657 --> 12:27.618
The cocoon, it moves. Why does it do that?

12:27.701 --> 12:32.081
That's even worse. You must summon
someone quickly so they can take it away.

12:33.207 --> 12:34.375
What for?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.920
The worm is ready to emerge

12:38.003 --> 12:41.716
and it cannot do so without
ruining all the silk from the cocoon.

12:41.799 --> 12:44.927
The Overseers will not take kindly to it.

12:45.636 --> 12:46.846
What is your name?

12:48.931 --> 12:50.141
What do you care?

12:51.308 --> 12:54.812
You seem awfully concerned with my welfare
despite the fact we've never spoken.

12:54.895 --> 12:57.106
-I want to know your name.
-My name is Cora.

12:57.189 --> 13:01.235
And my concern is for my welfare,
not for yours.

13:01.318 --> 13:05.531
If the Overseers or, worse yet,
Cutter gets angry with one of us,

13:05.614 --> 13:07.783
the rest of us end up suffering as well.

13:08.576 --> 13:11.787
I'm gonna be very honest with you, Cora.

13:12.204 --> 13:14.039
This is no way to live your life.

13:14.457 --> 13:16.792
Okay. So you're one of those.

13:19.378 --> 13:20.379
"Those"?

13:20.463 --> 13:25.259
You're not the first woman of means who's
found herself kneeling before the rack,

13:25.342 --> 13:28.054
lamenting her change in circumstances.

13:29.305 --> 13:35.269
Here, I am fed,
I'm sheltered, and I'm unmolested.

13:36.228 --> 13:40.274
There are much worse ways
to live your life, I can assure you.

13:41.275 --> 13:44.070
Perhaps you're entitled
to want more than that.

13:44.153 --> 13:48.783
There is no part of me
that needs more than that in my future.

13:49.784 --> 13:53.037
Well, maybe, like our little friend here,

13:53.579 --> 13:58.250
you could grow new parts
to accommodate the need to want more.

13:59.668 --> 14:02.004
You! Why are you idle?

14:02.088 --> 14:03.381
Why are you not working?

14:04.590 --> 14:06.050
I am glad you're here.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.969
I wasn't sure what to do with that
and I wanted to--

14:12.014 --> 14:14.809
This is urgent.

14:15.643 --> 14:18.104
This could have been wasted.

14:22.191 --> 14:23.359
Get back to work.

14:24.985 --> 14:27.196
I said, get back to work!

14:28.531 --> 14:30.032
Mind your racks.

14:31.617 --> 14:33.619
Will you get up for me?

14:36.330 --> 14:39.375
You're making me so very angry right now.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.798
I said, will you get up for me?

14:58.269 --> 14:59.270
No.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.151
You are new. You will learn.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.362
Let me know when she stirs.

15:08.779 --> 15:10.281
We'll try again.

15:15.786 --> 15:17.788
<i>So much is about to change...</i>

15:19.457 --> 15:20.750
<i>in a moment.</i>

15:22.251 --> 15:26.172
<i>The world is shedding its skin,
revealing something new.</i>

15:26.797 --> 15:28.966
<i>And yet all I can feel is sadness.</i>

15:31.594 --> 15:35.139
Any words I might deploy to address it...

15:37.224 --> 15:39.643
seem small to me...

15:41.437 --> 15:44.690
and unworthy of a great life.

15:50.237 --> 15:51.489
So I'll just say...

15:58.704 --> 16:00.664
The task of succeeding you...

16:02.750 --> 16:04.335
it's doomed to fail.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.130
You're irreplaceable.

16:11.008 --> 16:12.760
But I will do my best...

16:14.053 --> 16:17.264
to preserve what you've left me,
to make you proud.

16:25.231 --> 16:26.232
Come.

16:29.485 --> 16:30.528
Maghra?

16:33.948 --> 16:35.950
It's okay, don't be frightened. I'm here.

16:36.659 --> 16:37.868
I'm right here.

16:50.047 --> 16:51.257
Things will change.

16:53.926 --> 16:59.348
But what will never change is this:

17:03.394 --> 17:05.312
I'm going to take care of you.

17:08.357 --> 17:09.608
Maghra.

17:12.611 --> 17:17.158
It's astonishing how the smallest
moment can change an entire world.

17:18.701 --> 17:21.245
How many lives can be upended.

17:21.829 --> 17:25.499
Kingdoms. History. All of it.

17:26.584 --> 17:31.088
<i>All set in motion by a dying man
whispering four words to his daughter.</i>

17:36.844 --> 17:40.097
"You must rule... soon."

17:45.144 --> 17:51.567
What he said, if he said it, was far less
destructive than what you did about it.

17:51.650 --> 17:52.985
Your choice, Maghra, not his.

17:53.069 --> 17:54.320
"If" he said it?

17:56.947 --> 17:59.742
There was a time
you would have taken me at my word.

17:59.825 --> 18:01.786
I have no wish to play games with you.

18:01.869 --> 18:03.245
What games?

18:03.829 --> 18:06.165
When I came of age
and tried to rally support

18:06.248 --> 18:09.668
to remove my sister from the throne,
it was no game to me.

18:09.752 --> 18:12.630
When most of the generals
and half the court pledged their support

18:12.713 --> 18:15.883
to make the change,
it certainly was no game to them.

18:16.300 --> 18:19.970
And when you held the fate
of the entire kingdom in your hands,

18:20.054 --> 18:23.974
the one voice of support I needed
to make good a king's dying wish,

18:24.058 --> 18:27.603
when you could have changed
the world with just one word, "yes"...

18:28.729 --> 18:29.939
you said "no."

18:30.022 --> 18:32.650
-Was it a game to you then?
-You were a child--

18:32.733 --> 18:36.362
I was old enough to understand
what had been obvious to my father,

18:36.445 --> 18:39.281
that my sister was ill-suited
for the role...

18:40.408 --> 18:43.994
that the weight of her authority
would aggravate all of her weaknesses.

18:44.578 --> 18:48.999
I loved my sister,
but I knew what she would become.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.960
And I tried to save her from it.

18:52.294 --> 18:53.462
And was I wrong?

18:54.004 --> 18:55.256
Were you wrong?

18:58.134 --> 18:59.510
You were smart.

19:02.471 --> 19:05.850
You were kind, and you were loyal.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.185
And you weren't strong enough.

19:09.854 --> 19:11.772
Say what you want about your sister,

19:11.856 --> 19:14.150
but that has never been a label
applicable to her.

19:14.233 --> 19:17.737
You underestimated me then,
and you're doing it again now.

19:18.237 --> 19:19.905
None of this is what I asked.

19:20.406 --> 19:22.408
She told me you were dead.

19:22.491 --> 19:25.369
She told us all
that Jerlamarel killed you. Why?

19:26.120 --> 19:28.831
As soon as I failed,
I knew I could not stay.

19:30.374 --> 19:31.792
So I ran.

19:32.126 --> 19:34.712
She lied. And here we are.

19:35.504 --> 19:38.049
You didn't just attempt
to seize her crown.

19:38.549 --> 19:41.302
You didn't just run when you failed.

19:41.719 --> 19:44.847
You took her most favored consort
in the bargain too.

19:48.434 --> 19:51.228
It gave me no pleasure to hurt her
in that way.

19:52.938 --> 19:57.276
But Jerlamarel had an opportunity
to wield significant power through her,

19:57.693 --> 20:00.780
and instead he chose
to be a fugitive with me.

20:01.947 --> 20:05.785
That should tell you how little control
we had over that relationship.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.622
It was simply beyond our abilities
to deny.

20:09.705 --> 20:12.333
And where is he now? Where is Jerlamarel?

20:12.416 --> 20:13.793
I don't know.

20:13.876 --> 20:16.796
I haven't heard his voice
since before the children were born.

20:17.421 --> 20:19.423
Children I have hunted
to the ends of the earth,

20:19.507 --> 20:21.842
without ever knowing who they truly were.

20:22.259 --> 20:23.844
Children who are still fugitives

20:23.928 --> 20:26.806
that I have spent half a lifetime
sworn to apprehend.

20:26.889 --> 20:29.975
Then your grievance is with the queen
who swore you to it.

20:30.059 --> 20:33.062
I encourage you to go home
and confront her about it.

20:35.606 --> 20:38.651
I will have something
brought to you to eat.

20:43.489 --> 20:47.660
In the meantime,
I thank you to remain inside.

20:47.743 --> 20:50.579
Your presence among the men
will only confuse them.

20:52.289 --> 20:53.499
Tamacti Jun.

20:55.876 --> 20:57.253
When you find them...

20:58.129 --> 20:59.672
will you leave us be?

21:29.493 --> 21:30.703
Someone's here.

21:48.512 --> 21:51.182
You are uninvited, yes?

21:53.267 --> 21:55.144
You are uninvited, yes?

21:55.227 --> 21:59.356
Woman. Yes. But we did not intend--

21:59.440 --> 22:01.025
You came to us. Why?

22:01.859 --> 22:07.531
We were trapped here by a man who--
By a boy who betrayed us.

22:08.616 --> 22:10.493
We're only looking for a way out.

22:11.869 --> 22:13.079
A boy.

22:14.705 --> 22:17.500
You are welcome as long as you like. Come.

22:20.711 --> 22:22.713
Where is here? Who are you?

22:22.797 --> 22:24.215
Come. This way.

22:41.065 --> 22:44.693
It's all right. You'll be all right.

23:12.138 --> 23:13.347
Where are we?

23:15.057 --> 23:17.059
We all woke up here with the door locked.

23:17.143 --> 23:19.145
None of us know any more than you do.

23:19.895 --> 23:22.148
That taste in your mouth
is Queen's Stalk.

23:22.815 --> 23:25.151
It's mushrooms to numb the senses.

23:28.487 --> 23:29.613
And the lights?

23:30.030 --> 23:31.323
Lights?

23:31.407 --> 23:32.992
You didn't tell them, Kofun?

23:34.535 --> 23:38.164
Some kind of glowing bugs
hanging from the ceiling.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.966
There are stories of clans
who took refuge below.

23:50.092 --> 23:52.845
Some who have been away below so long...

23:54.346 --> 23:56.390
they are something other than human.

23:59.435 --> 24:02.438
Whoever it is, if they wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

24:03.397 --> 24:05.316
How do we know we're not dead?

24:08.194 --> 24:09.820
'Cause Mom still isn't here.

24:14.658 --> 24:17.661
And wanting to kill us
is different from wanting us dead.

24:19.371 --> 24:21.874
Maybe they left us in here
so we'd finish each other off for them.

24:21.957 --> 24:24.001
Well, they're going
to be very disappointed,

24:24.543 --> 24:27.755
because for as long as we are in here,
we will remain together.

24:27.838 --> 24:31.050
We will hold together
until we get free of it.

24:32.551 --> 24:34.970
If they don't mean to kill us,
then they need to feed us.

24:35.054 --> 24:37.556
Which means, at some point,
someone needs to come through this door.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.727
And when that door opens...
I will get us a way out.

24:42.436 --> 24:43.729
But for how long?

24:44.730 --> 24:45.898
What?

24:45.981 --> 24:48.984
For how long do you think
we can hold together in here?

25:40.411 --> 25:42.329
Here. That's warm.

25:43.539 --> 25:46.250
Won't heal anything,
but it might at least help you sleep.

26:00.848 --> 26:02.308
Why are you helping me?

26:05.186 --> 26:10.066
I was the youngest of six
and our father was a monster.

26:12.943 --> 26:16.697
We all suffered his cruelty
and his anger...

26:17.698 --> 26:18.908
his lust.

26:19.742 --> 26:22.787
We all suffered it knowing
that it would likely never end.

26:24.205 --> 26:27.208
On the night I turned nine,
I'd had enough.

26:27.958 --> 26:32.838
I went to him in the night
and I stuck a knife through his heart.

26:35.091 --> 26:38.636
Then I went back to bed
and I slept soundly.

26:41.931 --> 26:43.140
Interesting.

26:44.141 --> 26:45.768
You think I'm weak.

26:46.310 --> 26:49.688
You think I don't resist
'cause I don't have the courage to.

26:50.648 --> 26:52.274
And you are wrong.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.830
I was the oldest of two.

27:10.251 --> 27:12.086
Our father was a kind man...

27:15.089 --> 27:16.966
to my sister, at any rate.

27:21.011 --> 27:24.724
To me, I never felt his anger,
or violence,

27:25.349 --> 27:28.185
or cruelty, or really anything.

27:33.858 --> 27:37.153
All I felt from him
was stark, cold indifference.

27:44.201 --> 27:45.870
I was the oldest...

27:47.204 --> 27:50.541
but he wanted to give away my birthright
to my younger sister...

27:53.961 --> 27:56.338
the one I cared for and protected...

27:58.632 --> 28:00.092
any way I could.

28:03.721 --> 28:05.514
He wanted to hand her my future.

28:11.228 --> 28:12.897
It was then that I learned...

28:16.609 --> 28:18.027
in this life...

28:20.196 --> 28:22.323
one must take the life one wants.

28:25.951 --> 28:30.039
So I took everything from them both.

28:32.249 --> 28:34.794
What was "everything"? What did you take?

28:39.965 --> 28:41.675
More than you can imagine.

28:52.686 --> 28:55.439
How many of us exactly are there here?

28:56.732 --> 28:59.026
The workers?
There are near thirty of us.

29:04.448 --> 29:05.825
And how many of them?

29:06.867 --> 29:09.537
Four Overseers and the Cutter himself.

29:12.415 --> 29:14.583
What kinds of weapons do they possess?

29:14.667 --> 29:17.503
I don't know. Knives and clubs.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.424
And, well, you've met the Shadows.
They lurk outside.

29:21.966 --> 29:23.634
One never knows where they are.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.891
If there are enough of us...

29:32.017 --> 29:36.605
if we get our hands on those weapons,
it might not matter.

29:38.774 --> 29:40.860
Follow me and I'll make it so.

29:42.236 --> 29:45.990
Why would anyone follow you?
No one has any idea who you are.

29:49.201 --> 29:53.289
I believe once you tell them who I am,
they'll understand.

29:54.123 --> 29:56.792
Well, I don't have any idea
who you are either.

30:01.005 --> 30:03.799
Let's fix that, shall we?

30:18.731 --> 30:19.774
Well?

30:21.692 --> 30:23.402
I did what you asked.

30:27.073 --> 30:28.574
And I have news.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.303
They're all asleep.

30:49.387 --> 30:51.722
I know. They snore.

30:52.431 --> 30:57.019
Not quite as loud as when they
were babies, but I can still hear it.

30:58.604 --> 30:59.814
It's comforting.

31:01.273 --> 31:07.696
I have known them almost as long
as I knew you before they arrived.

31:09.281 --> 31:10.491
That isn't right.

31:12.284 --> 31:13.494
Can that be right?

31:23.546 --> 31:25.840
I remember the day you arrived.

31:26.382 --> 31:28.843
So strong...

31:31.637 --> 31:33.389
but so broken.

31:33.931 --> 31:35.141
Baba.

31:38.352 --> 31:39.895
I remember thinking...

31:41.272 --> 31:45.192
"What horrors has this boy
walked through?"

31:46.485 --> 31:47.903
I said to myself,

31:48.446 --> 31:54.994
"Oh, Paris, do not put this one through

31:55.077 --> 32:00.875
any more suffering
than he's already endured."

32:02.001 --> 32:07.131
I'm afraid...
that is exactly what I have done.

32:07.214 --> 32:11.302
Baba. I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

32:11.969 --> 32:15.681
I had her hand in mine. I had it.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.933
She was right there.

32:18.017 --> 32:19.018
Don't.

32:19.101 --> 32:21.520
Then she was gone.

32:23.397 --> 32:29.653
I am the one who's pushing the children
to want more,

32:29.737 --> 32:32.031
to need more.

32:33.032 --> 32:35.451
This is where it led.

32:35.868 --> 32:38.704
Paris, stop. Please, stop.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.458
Stop. Stop.

32:46.295 --> 32:48.005
I have to hold this together.

32:48.881 --> 32:52.009
I have to hold them together.

32:55.596 --> 33:00.101
If they have any reason
to think that I'm coming apart...

33:01.477 --> 33:06.482
If they sense it, even for a moment,
this is all over.

33:08.150 --> 33:12.613
Okay? You have done nothing but love them.

33:16.117 --> 33:18.744
I will not permit you
to apologize for that.

33:26.001 --> 33:29.880
What happened was not...
It wasn't your fault.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.639
Then whose fault was it?

33:47.064 --> 33:48.774
No. No.

33:49.275 --> 33:55.573
No! No! Let fucking go of me! You fu--

33:59.243 --> 34:00.786
Your Majesty.

34:03.748 --> 34:05.249
When they first brought you to me,

34:05.332 --> 34:09.503
I was skeptical, I admit,
that you would be of any use.

34:10.337 --> 34:15.134
We have had wealthy ones before
and, frankly, they never last very long.

34:16.594 --> 34:20.389
But you are not merely wealthy.

34:21.849 --> 34:24.435
You are something else entirely.

34:28.773 --> 34:30.649
My army will return for me.

34:31.650 --> 34:32.860
And when they do...

34:33.736 --> 34:38.157
you will regret every fucking malice bone
in your fucking body,

34:38.240 --> 34:40.493
you fucking piece of shit.

34:40.576 --> 34:42.078
I'm gonna have you killed.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.332
I'm gonna do everything possible

34:46.415 --> 34:49.126
to take away your fucking power,
you fuck.

34:56.467 --> 35:02.973
I can only imagine the number of people
that have dreamt of doing this to you.

35:03.766 --> 35:05.893
The Witchfinder is far from here.

35:06.769 --> 35:10.481
But when he left, he made it clear
where he was going, and what for,

35:11.357 --> 35:14.234
on the off chance
that we might acquire any information

35:14.318 --> 35:16.153
that would be of value to him.

35:17.238 --> 35:22.283
I think we could safely agree
that the most valuable thing in his world

35:22.952 --> 35:25.830
is now in my possession.

35:27.415 --> 35:30.835
The only question being
how to prove it to him.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.674
I heard a story once.
Perhaps you can tell me if it is true.

35:36.757 --> 35:40.928
I heard that when a Payan monarch
ascends the throne,

35:41.011 --> 35:43.347
a ceremony takes place
to honor the occasion.

35:43.431 --> 35:45.223
And in that ceremony,

35:45.307 --> 35:51.063
an amulet that is embedded
beneath the skin of the reigning monarch

35:51.147 --> 35:54.900
is removed and implanted into his heir.

35:56.527 --> 35:57.737
Table.

36:10.374 --> 36:13.878
An amulet that resides
just above the heart.

36:16.505 --> 36:18.340
Could this possibly be true?

36:21.260 --> 36:24.722
What do you know? It is true.

36:52.541 --> 36:53.918
Thank you for this.

36:55.086 --> 36:59.924
Now, let us find out what it can do.

37:30.287 --> 37:31.288
Wait, please.

37:32.498 --> 37:34.208
You're gonna help us get outta here.

37:34.291 --> 37:36.210
That is precisely why I'm here.

37:36.293 --> 37:37.461
What I'm doing is forbidden.

37:37.545 --> 37:40.631
If they hear us,
it will be as dangerous for me as for you.

37:40.715 --> 37:44.135
Please. Let me tell you what I know.

37:51.016 --> 37:52.435
My name is Delia.

37:53.394 --> 37:57.732
This place you find yourself in,
it is peaceful, it is tranquil,

37:57.815 --> 37:59.358
but it is so unforgiving.

38:00.151 --> 38:04.113
To protect this place,
it must never touch the world above.

38:04.780 --> 38:07.199
So none who enter may ever leave.

38:08.367 --> 38:11.036
There have been uninvited in the past.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.832
And, in the past, they have been permitted
to decide to join us,

38:14.915 --> 38:19.086
but not soon, not for some time.

38:19.587 --> 38:22.798
The urge to return is too strong.
It cannot be willed away.

38:24.050 --> 38:25.426
How much time?

38:25.843 --> 38:30.931
When I arrived, five winters and summers
passed before the door was open to me.

38:31.474 --> 38:33.559
That can't be all you came to say.

38:34.643 --> 38:35.853
Why are you here?

38:36.395 --> 38:37.563
I believe you...

38:38.522 --> 38:42.234
that you were lured here... by a boy.

38:43.444 --> 38:49.700
Though, he's probably more a man and less
a boy than he was when he lured me here.

38:51.077 --> 38:53.871
Boots. You know him?

38:57.875 --> 38:59.168
He's my son.

39:01.837 --> 39:05.466
It wasn't long after he was born
before I realized he was different.

39:06.175 --> 39:09.428
It wasn't long after that
before the rest of the village did too.

39:11.055 --> 39:12.598
I tried to protect him.

39:13.307 --> 39:16.811
I pled for understanding
and mercy from the others.

39:16.894 --> 39:21.023
He was just a boy.
His curse just an accident of nature.

39:22.024 --> 39:26.695
They ridiculed him,
spat upon him, beat him...

39:27.696 --> 39:29.281
sometimes worse.

39:30.074 --> 39:31.909
Where was his father?

39:32.326 --> 39:33.619
He was gone.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.205
A man who'd only joined our village
recently

39:36.288 --> 39:38.332
when the boy was still very small.

39:38.416 --> 39:40.668
He left one day. He never returned.

39:48.843 --> 39:54.557
The boy grew quieter as he got older,
and angrier...

39:56.434 --> 39:58.561
until one day
he couldn't suffer it anymore.

40:00.312 --> 40:01.731
What did he do to them?

40:02.773 --> 40:05.735
He started with the ones
who had been most violent with him.

40:07.695 --> 40:09.113
<i>Killed some in their sleep.</i>

40:11.532 --> 40:15.953
<i>Some he chased
as they ran in panic and terror.</i>

40:18.831 --> 40:22.209
<i>When that was done, he moved on to
the ones who simply spoke ill toward him.</i>

40:22.668 --> 40:27.590
<i>By the time the bloodshed was over,
the only Opayol left were him and me.</i>

40:29.341 --> 40:30.926
Why are you telling us this?

40:35.139 --> 40:36.474
The child is my fault.

40:37.892 --> 40:40.436
Therefore your presence here
is my fault as well.

40:41.771 --> 40:45.316
Whichever of you is successful
in escaping here alive...

40:46.317 --> 40:49.320
swear to me that you will find the boy,

40:49.820 --> 40:51.906
that you will find my son...

40:54.075 --> 40:55.659
and you will kill him.

41:02.041 --> 41:03.209
I'll do it.

42:16.490 --> 42:18.492
This place is forbidden by the elders,

42:18.576 --> 42:21.454
but I have felt the power
of the God Flame coming from above.

42:21.537 --> 42:23.581
Haniwa. Why did you fall behind?

42:23.664 --> 42:25.833
Sorry. I saw something.

42:25.916 --> 42:27.126
Saw what?

42:28.711 --> 42:30.171
You wouldn't understand.

42:32.548 --> 42:36.635
She saw. Be so very careful with her.

42:43.476 --> 42:46.353
Dad. Dad, I think I know how this works.

42:46.437 --> 42:49.565
We have to pull this
till the elevator rises to the top.

42:49.648 --> 42:52.026
We can control it from above.
Send it back down.

42:52.109 --> 42:54.695
But someone has to stay down here
and hold this thing.

43:00.993 --> 43:02.620
How many do you think there could be?

43:02.703 --> 43:05.456
Too many.
I'll do what I can to slow them down.

43:08.918 --> 43:10.378
All right. Everyone in.

43:10.461 --> 43:12.505
-No, Dad. I can help you.
-Get in, boy!

43:13.672 --> 43:15.091
-You in?
-Yeah.

43:22.598 --> 43:25.101
Papa, we'll send it right back.

44:37.923 --> 44:40.801
We're here. We're here. Okay, come on.

44:48.309 --> 44:50.061
Papa, we're bringing it back down!

45:12.625 --> 45:13.918
Help me!

45:57.002 --> 45:58.003
No!

45:58.504 --> 45:59.714
Dad, move!

46:42.423 --> 46:43.632
-Kofun!
-Papa!

46:43.716 --> 46:44.925
Haniwa!

46:46.218 --> 46:47.678
Dad! Dad!

46:48.095 --> 46:49.764
Papa, we're here! We're here.

46:52.892 --> 46:54.560
-Dad!
-He's climbing.

46:55.186 --> 46:57.021
We're here, Papa. You're okay.

46:57.104 --> 46:59.648
Can you hear us? We're right here.

46:59.732 --> 47:00.983
Follow our voices.

47:03.319 --> 47:05.071
You're okay. You're okay.

47:06.238 --> 47:07.573
We're right here. We're right here.

47:07.656 --> 47:08.699
We're here.

47:08.783 --> 47:11.494
Come on. Please. You're okay.
You're okay, we're close.

47:12.661 --> 47:13.788
Hold on! Hold on!

47:14.205 --> 47:15.498
Papa, please hold on.

47:15.581 --> 47:16.582
To your right.

47:16.665 --> 47:18.334
Dad, there's a ledge to your right.

47:19.668 --> 47:20.628
No! Dad!

47:26.008 --> 47:27.009
We're here!

47:27.093 --> 47:28.302
You're close.

47:29.303 --> 47:31.430
Come on, Dad, you're almost here.

47:34.308 --> 47:35.684
I don't know wh--

47:36.477 --> 47:37.812
You're so close.

47:39.814 --> 47:41.023
He's too far.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.567
-Kofun, can you reach him?
-I'm reaching out a hand.

47:43.984 --> 47:45.528
Dad! Take my hand!

47:48.030 --> 47:50.658
Da-- I can't reach! I can't reach you!

47:51.867 --> 47:53.619
I can't reach you, it's too high.

48:01.377 --> 48:04.088
Okay. Okay.

48:05.881 --> 48:07.049
Dad!

48:07.133 --> 48:08.259
Hold on!

48:09.260 --> 48:11.679
-Dad! Hold on!
-Please! Hold on, Papa!

48:11.762 --> 48:13.264
We have you!

48:14.765 --> 48:15.975
Please hold on. Please.

48:19.770 --> 48:20.938
-Dad!
-Boy.

48:21.021 --> 48:21.939
Give me your hand!

48:22.022 --> 48:23.190
You can do it!

48:31.907 --> 48:34.034
I have you. I have you!

49:32.510 --> 49:35.012
A member of your party has been located.

49:35.638 --> 49:38.099
He is here.

49:39.433 --> 49:40.643
Maghra.

49:45.398 --> 49:47.274
This is one of yours, is it not?

49:52.863 --> 49:55.116
Yes. It is.

49:58.327 --> 49:59.537
Leave us.

50:00.788 --> 50:01.997
Please.

50:12.591 --> 50:13.801
Where's my family?

50:17.346 --> 50:19.473
-I don't know.
-You left them.

50:19.557 --> 50:20.975
There was fighting.

50:21.058 --> 50:23.978
I tried to help them.
But when I looked, they were gone.

50:25.146 --> 50:26.689
I came here to help you.

50:26.772 --> 50:29.316
If you wanna help me,
go find my husband and my children.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.609
I have tried.

50:31.485 --> 50:35.114
I will try again if that is what you ask,

50:35.656 --> 50:38.909
but please know
there are other ways I can help you.

50:38.993 --> 50:40.703
There is nothing else that I want.

50:41.871 --> 50:43.873
I saw them kneel before you.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.755
<i>They believe you to be important. Yes?</i>

50:55.092 --> 50:58.721
To be important you need to be strong.

51:00.097 --> 51:01.515
I can make you strong.

51:02.850 --> 51:06.228
I can do things no one here can.

51:07.354 --> 51:14.361
If I were in your service,
you could do things no one here can.

51:16.572 --> 51:20.242
Better if they don't have to believe
you're important.

51:20.826 --> 51:23.245
Better to be strong enough to prove it.

51:26.499 --> 51:29.627
I would be devoted to your service...

51:31.253 --> 51:33.756
and all I would ask is one thing from you.

51:34.256 --> 51:35.549
What?

51:36.634 --> 51:39.345
That you promise not to be mean to me.

52:04.495 --> 52:05.538
What is it?

52:07.498 --> 52:09.166
Please return to the tent.

52:09.250 --> 52:11.544
-I'll join you momentarily.
-I'm not going anywhere.

52:11.627 --> 52:12.837
Tell me what happened.

52:25.474 --> 52:29.228
The author of that message claims
to be holding the queen. Your sister.

52:30.563 --> 52:31.772
Ransom?

52:31.856 --> 52:35.276
They claim that unless we deliver
the requested payment

52:35.359 --> 52:37.153
to the specified location--

52:37.236 --> 52:38.654
This is a fraud.

52:38.738 --> 52:41.949
How could someone have kidnapped
the queen from inside Kanzua?

52:42.366 --> 52:43.993
An army protects her there.

52:53.753 --> 52:56.005
Give me a moment
to confer with my lieutenants.

52:56.881 --> 52:58.507
I'll meet you inside shortly.

53:06.724 --> 53:08.059
Let me help you.

53:09.935 --> 53:10.936
What?

53:12.646 --> 53:14.607
I know who left that message.

53:15.691 --> 53:17.193
Who has your sister.

53:17.276 --> 53:18.778
How could you possibly?

53:19.695 --> 53:21.197
Because they are still here.

53:26.077 --> 53:27.578
I can see them.

53:36.462 --> 53:40.633
Tell me you will accept me
into your service as your lieutenant.

53:43.594 --> 53:46.680
I am the only one here who can help you.

53:48.307 --> 53:51.644
Just say yes, and I will do it.
