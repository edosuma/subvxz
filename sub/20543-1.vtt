01:36.325 --> 01:38.916
Johnny. You're gonna
be late for work again.

01:38.917 --> 01:41.759
I'm up mom.

01:56.412 --> 01:59.112
Good morning gorgeous.

02:06.596 --> 02:07.762
Good morning.

02:08.535 --> 02:09.965
Or should I say good afternoon?

02:09.966 --> 02:12.902
Wooh. Bacon.
I love bacon.

02:12.903 --> 02:14.750
And mama loves you.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.197
John Blake Wentworth.

02:27.198 --> 02:29.959
How many times have I told
you to cut the grass?

02:31.663 --> 02:32.779
It's a jungle out there.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.683
I promise. I will cut it tomorrow.

02:34.684 --> 02:35.977
For sure.

02:35.978 --> 02:39.578
Tomorrow? Tomorrow.
You're almost a grown man.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.403
And I am late for work.

02:53.463 --> 02:56.279
Who's the most beautiful
mother in all of Shady grove? Hm?

02:56.670 --> 02:58.386
Who is it?
I think it's you.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.135
Who is that?

02:59.136 --> 03:01.661
It's my mom.
My mom is.

03:04.962 --> 03:07.780
Ok. How much?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.559
What?

03:10.462 --> 03:11.997
I mean it.

03:13.787 --> 03:15.050
Fifty Bucks?

03:15.998 --> 03:18.990
For someone that works as much as you do,
how come you're always so broke?

03:18.991 --> 03:23.140
It's Veronica.
She's, she has expensive taste.

03:23.141 --> 03:25.710
She should get a job. Like Michelle.

03:25.711 --> 03:27.809
Michelle. She's like a friend from
grade school. Okay.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.057
Veronica is hot.

03:29.058 --> 03:31.570
- Michelle is perfect for you.
- Veronica is great.

03:31.571 --> 03:32.989
And she is crazy about me.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.018
Of course she is crazy about you.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.762
You shower her with attention
and money all the time.

03:37.763 --> 03:40.412
No. It's not like that.
She's a really sweet girl.

03:41.718 --> 03:43.181
You'll see.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.380
Okay.
When do I get to meet her?

03:47.670 --> 03:51.251
Uh. You'll get to meet her very soon.
She's just uh...

03:52.893 --> 03:55.410
- She's just a really, uh... Shy girl
- Uh Hmm...

03:55.411 --> 03:56.917
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

03:56.918 --> 03:57.877
Uh hm.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.906
Have you seen my tablet?

04:00.299 --> 04:01.025
No.

04:01.026 --> 04:02.341
Did you ask your uncle Luther?

04:03.116 --> 04:04.026
Luther?

04:04.027 --> 04:08.121
You be nice to your uncle.
He's a misunderstood genius.

04:15.655 --> 04:20.392
Alright Veloci.
We are going to make history.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.891
Don't worry.
This won't hurt a bit,

04:24.892 --> 04:26.267
because you're dead.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.372
And if you aren't,

04:28.372 --> 04:30.439
it'd hurt like a motherfucker.

04:31.079 --> 04:33.174
Here we go.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.266
There.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.569
Shit, Shit, Shit!

04:53.454 --> 04:56.672
No. No, you may not eat Minnie.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.358
You, Bitch!

05:02.613 --> 05:03.572
You...

05:05.662 --> 05:07.269
Uncle Luther.

05:11.123 --> 05:13.804
Uncle Luther.
Open up.

05:13.805 --> 05:15.253
Bitch!

05:16.623 --> 05:18.020
Uncle Luther, do you
have a chicken in there?

05:18.021 --> 05:18.737
What's going on?

05:18.737 --> 05:19.574
Noth'n

05:19.575 --> 05:21.426
Uncle Luther, open up.

05:22.341 --> 05:23.584
Do you have my tablet?

05:41.494 --> 05:46.520
I've done it. I've made the greatest
discovery in the twenty first century.

05:51.858 --> 05:53.678
Geez man. Didn't you hear me calling you?

05:53.679 --> 05:57.257
Please, never enter my lair
when the door is locked.

05:58.801 --> 06:00.231
Oh, there it is.

06:01.097 --> 06:03.711
- No, I need that.
- Oh man, what did you do?

06:03.712 --> 06:05.048
I'm late. I gotta go.

06:05.049 --> 06:06.466
No. Wait.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.582
You're gonna ruin my greatest hour.

06:26.058 --> 06:27.725
Cool. Thanks.

06:27.726 --> 06:30.766
- Hey.
- What?

06:30.767 --> 06:33.066
I told you I needed that laptop
done by this morning.

06:33.532 --> 06:37.651
So imagine my surprise.
When I come downstairs and

06:37.652 --> 06:40.637
see it still sitting there...
untouched.

06:40.638 --> 06:43.200
Well, it's not like I wasn't working.

06:45.115 --> 06:48.254
Serving doughnuts, not exactly a
flourishing career move.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.103
Neither is lying, and getting paid for it.

06:51.104 --> 06:52.346
I'm not lying.

06:52.483 --> 06:53.331
Really?

06:53.331 --> 06:54.220
Really.

06:54.221 --> 06:58.998
People bring me their broken shit.
They pay me. They pick it up fixed.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.051
Not by you.

07:00.399 --> 07:01.377
Who cares?

07:01.378 --> 07:04.347
Me. The person who's not
getting paid for the work.

07:04.801 --> 07:05.955
I pay you.

07:06.241 --> 07:08.090
Is it invisible money?

07:08.623 --> 07:09.844
It's wear and tear.

07:10.105 --> 07:10.842
Huh?

07:10.843 --> 07:11.989
I drive you to work.

07:12.337 --> 07:14.999
Half the time, I am late...

07:15.430 --> 07:16.728
That's not the point.

07:16.729 --> 07:20.230
And the other half, you make
me take the bus, at night.

07:21.162 --> 07:22.519
Also not the point.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.248
Then what is the point
of this conversation,

07:24.272 --> 07:25.883
other than you making
me late, right now?

07:26.259 --> 07:28.738
The point of this conversation is,

07:28.739 --> 07:32.324
I do something for you,
you do something for me.

07:32.671 --> 07:36.501
I fix your computers while
you lie and say you do.

07:36.824 --> 07:37.867
That's something.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.432
You didn't fix the laptop.

07:39.838 --> 07:41.211
Well, it's not going to happen right now.

07:41.212 --> 07:42.363
When?

07:42.561 --> 07:44.622
- After work.
- Tonight.

07:44.977 --> 07:46.107
Fine.

07:46.763 --> 07:48.566
I'm not driving you tomorrow
if you don't do it.

07:48.987 --> 07:50.470
- Really?
- Really.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.005
What's next?
You gonna tell mom?

07:53.671 --> 07:56.026
And you sassing me is
not helping the situation.

07:57.469 --> 08:00.669
How about I walk for now on?
And you fix your own computers.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.076
Okay. If that's how you want to play it.

08:02.077 --> 08:02.871
Yes.

08:02.872 --> 08:05.306
You're bluffing, but...
cool.

08:05.307 --> 08:06.525
Okay. Hey hey hey. Shh.

08:07.402 --> 08:08.675
Let's just chill.

08:11.182 --> 08:13.589
Breath it out.

08:13.958 --> 08:15.658
Always the loving brother.

08:16.020 --> 08:16.746
Thank you.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.351
I was being sarcastic.

08:18.352 --> 08:20.309
- I know.
- Dick.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.739
Bitch.

08:54.824 --> 08:56.669
Nice to be to make it, sunshine.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.159
This thing is ruined.

09:01.697 --> 09:04.342
Hold your water Nancy?
I got it.

09:04.343 --> 09:06.975
It's useless.
My stupid uncle.

09:14.202 --> 09:15.031
Here you go.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.421
What the...

09:17.422 --> 09:20.617
- How did you...
- I got the skills to pay the bills baby.

09:22.798 --> 09:26.799
Damn. It stinks.
Did you take out the garbage?

09:27.478 --> 09:30.879
I was a little busy. What, with being
the only one here, and all.

09:31.878 --> 09:34.520
Sorry, I... I'm just having a...

09:36.036 --> 09:37.421
Whatever.

09:37.422 --> 09:38.381
I'll take it out.

09:39.135 --> 09:40.787
I'll help you.

09:49.979 --> 09:52.965
We shouldn't leave the store.
What if we get a customer?

09:52.966 --> 09:55.611
Yeah right. We haven't
had a customer in days.

09:55.934 --> 09:57.855
It's just slow right now. It'll pick up.

09:58.149 --> 10:00.021
I don't know how Cliff manages
to stay in business.

10:00.022 --> 10:04.337
Easy. He pays us crappy wages and
cuts every corner imaginable.

10:22.837 --> 10:24.556
- Johnny.
- Hey Babe.

10:29.221 --> 10:31.950
I've been looking all over for you.

10:32.319 --> 10:34.418
Great.
Princess "Spread Your Legs".

10:34.419 --> 10:36.107
Come on babe. You know
I work the late shift.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.668
Yes. Of course.

10:39.571 --> 10:41.358
Johnny. We have to get back to work.

10:42.634 --> 10:44.048
You should come inside.

10:44.049 --> 10:46.564
I can't. I'm in a rush.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.575
Who's the dude?

10:50.169 --> 10:51.998
Oh, that's Bobby.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.659
He's just giving me a ride.

10:53.908 --> 10:55.298
I'll bet he is.

10:55.647 --> 10:57.200
What did you say?

10:57.201 --> 10:59.797
Nothing.
I am going back inside.

10:59.798 --> 11:02.350
I'll leave you two love birds alone.

11:03.449 --> 11:06.581
- Thanks Michelle.
- Bye. Michelle.

11:07.319 --> 11:10.502
Weird. I don't think your
friend likes me very much.

11:10.856 --> 11:12.976
No. Michelle is great. She...

11:12.977 --> 11:16.966
Okay. What else...
Dude, I need money.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.413
Baby, I just gave you money yesterday.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.826
I know, but...
you work late,

11:24.827 --> 11:28.121
and leave me at home all by myself.
What am I supposed to do?

11:33.932 --> 11:36.263
Woah. What about my kiss?

11:36.264 --> 11:39.878
Babe let's go! I ain't got time.
I am on house arrest.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.643
Did he just call you babe?

11:43.682 --> 11:46.786
No.
Don't be silly.

12:12.668 --> 12:14.238
Oh hi Johnny.

12:14.239 --> 12:16.215
Hey Mrs. S, How are you today?

12:16.495 --> 12:17.814
Just Peachy.

12:18.326 --> 12:22.605
I'm going to treat myself to one of
these delicious jelly doughnuts.

12:22.924 --> 12:25.824
My. Look at that one. That's a tongue.

12:26.291 --> 12:32.725
I've been working extra hard on my diet,
and today is my cheat day.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.438
We'll be happy to take
care of that for you.

12:34.439 --> 12:35.896
Oh, great.

12:40.386 --> 12:42.077
Here comes trouble.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.370
Oh no.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.981
I'm here for the device.

12:47.981 --> 12:49.602
Uncle Luther. I am working.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.858
Where is it?

12:50.859 --> 12:54.031
I don't want to use salty
language in front of the lady.

12:54.032 --> 12:55.346
Oh my.

13:01.819 --> 13:03.981
I told you not to come back.

13:03.982 --> 13:05.380
I'm here to speak with my nephew.

13:05.381 --> 13:06.541
And I said get out.

13:06.542 --> 13:09.285
I don't want your kind in my
classy eating establishment.

13:09.286 --> 13:11.087
Yeah, this place screams class.

13:11.088 --> 13:14.720
Cliff, Luther is my uncle. He's one of
the few paying customers we have.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.236
And I told you not to let
him back into my store.

13:17.237 --> 13:18.937
- It's mine.
- Get! What are you doing?

13:18.938 --> 13:22.400
- Get out.
- Help me.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.400
You ruffian. Help. Police.
Help me.

13:26.401 --> 13:28.476
Johnny. Michelle.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.056
You ruffian

13:34.468 --> 13:36.028
Nope. Are you?

13:36.029 --> 13:37.412
I'm good.

13:37.413 --> 13:39.360
- You bastard.
- Help me.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.680
Johnny. Police. Help. Police.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.824
It's mine.

14:01.061 --> 14:03.020
You two are useless.

14:03.021 --> 14:07.374
I get assaulted, and you sit
there and you do nothing.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.556
Someone has to watch
the fryer at all times.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.346
Rule number three in the Dandy Donut
safety manual.

14:18.787 --> 14:20.773
Just gonna put that back, huh?

14:22.844 --> 14:24.810
I'll be in my office.

14:36.081 --> 14:37.223
I'm not hungry.

14:37.863 --> 14:40.527
But it's doughnuts.
It's free doughnuts.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.806
You know I don't take freebies Fred.

14:42.807 --> 14:45.649
Come on, you just gotta
lighten up just a little bit, uh?

14:48.741 --> 14:50.359
What about the perp?

14:50.543 --> 14:52.984
Don't mind me.
I'll wait here.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.178
Free doughnuts!

15:11.625 --> 15:13.608
Are my doughnuts ready dear?

15:25.419 --> 15:27.933
Here you go. A dozen for the waist.

15:27.934 --> 15:30.464
I only asked for one.

15:30.465 --> 15:33.461
Go for it. You earned it.
It's your cheat day.

15:33.462 --> 15:36.422
Oh well, if you insist.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.883
Thanks kids.

15:43.465 --> 15:45.228
Excuse me officers.
Excuse me.

15:45.229 --> 15:46.397
Good evening officers.

15:46.398 --> 15:47.621
What's up kids?

15:47.622 --> 15:49.389
Ah, we have a fresh batch of glazed.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.438
Ah, we can't wait,
we got a perp in the car.

15:51.439 --> 15:54.036
You better hurry. This man
wants some doughnuts.

15:54.859 --> 15:56.165
How about a cup of fresh coffee?

15:56.166 --> 15:58.878
Ah. Actually, you know what. We'll
just settle for a cup of yours.

15:58.879 --> 16:00.093
Good one.

16:00.094 --> 16:02.235
I tell you what. It's on the house.

16:02.236 --> 16:03.268
I like your style kid.

16:03.269 --> 16:04.852
Blue Light special?

16:05.454 --> 16:07.142
Now that's funny.

16:10.364 --> 16:11.962
I can't believe you like our coffee.

16:11.963 --> 16:16.837
Ah. I don't really.
It just keeps me regular.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.780
Anything for Shady Grove's finest.

16:20.781 --> 16:22.349
- Ah, thank you.
- Thank you.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.986
You have a free box of glazed.

16:25.119 --> 16:27.094
My favorite kind.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.718
Thanks kids.

16:29.103 --> 16:30.109
Have a good evening kids.

16:30.110 --> 16:30.702
See ya.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.886
Bye.

16:47.109 --> 16:48.687
Did you miss us?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.726
Oh. Doughnuts.
Can I get one?

16:50.727 --> 16:53.027
Oh shut up. There's no eating in the car.

16:53.028 --> 16:55.772
Woah woah woah. You're not
going to let me have a doughnut?

16:56.424 --> 16:58.601
No crumbs in the seat.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.558
Come on. can I get a doughnut?

17:00.559 --> 17:02.958
- No.
- Please.

17:04.143 --> 17:06.060
You're not gonna let him have a doughnut?

17:09.008 --> 17:12.788
Alright. Fine. We've broken all the
rules today, why stop now?

17:13.977 --> 17:17.268
- It's your lucky day.
- Nice. That looks good.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.163
My ass is kicking in.

17:28.405 --> 17:30.638
Damn, he was hungry.

17:40.775 --> 17:42.374
Whiskers Mcfur.

17:43.097 --> 17:46.168
We've been waiting for this all week.

18:33.727 --> 18:37.760
Come to mama boys.

19:11.557 --> 19:12.817
Man, you look terrible.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.107
I'm not feel'n too good.

19:14.108 --> 19:15.301
Hey look. If you hurl in this car,

19:15.302 --> 19:16.492
I'm gonna come back there
and break your...

19:16.493 --> 19:18.692
- Oh my God.
- God, what is that?

19:18.693 --> 19:21.221
- I think I'm gonna hurl.
- Wait till we get to the station.

19:21.222 --> 19:23.453
Station? This guy's going
to explode back there.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.496
Keep it together.

19:51.013 --> 19:52.447
- Here you go.
- Thank you my good man

19:52.448 --> 19:54.034
and put it on my tab.

19:54.035 --> 19:55.317
Of course.

20:00.776 --> 20:03.251
Do you smell patchouli?

20:18.470 --> 20:20.247
Greetings kids.

20:20.881 --> 20:22.097
Is Clifford available?

20:22.341 --> 20:23.842
Sure thing.
I'll get him.

20:28.447 --> 20:29.641
Can I get you anything?

20:29.642 --> 20:31.864
Oh no. I wouldn't get
caught dead here.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.443
I am on a very strict gluten
free paleo vegan diet.

20:38.748 --> 20:40.877
Flanagan what do you want?
I'm very busy.

20:42.578 --> 20:46.677
I just wanted to show you my,
latest creation.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.232
Lucky me. What is it?

20:48.233 --> 20:50.132
Open it, you silly goose.

20:53.308 --> 20:56.391
It's Fruitle Swoole's latest
edition to the menu.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.996
Behold.

20:59.344 --> 21:01.223
Circular Bliss.

21:01.389 --> 21:02.423
It looks like a tiny doughnut.

21:02.424 --> 21:04.665
Hey, what gives Flanagan?
It's a tiny round doughnut.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.629
It is a tiny round doughnut.
You Boof.

21:07.009 --> 21:08.662
Where do you think they get
the word "circular" from?

21:08.663 --> 21:09.677
So what's the big deal?

21:09.678 --> 21:13.470
The big deal my uncouth compadre,
is that it is made from the freshest

21:13.471 --> 21:17.402
certified organic gluten free,
fat free ingredients.

21:18.231 --> 21:20.118
Nothing less for my customers.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.264
Good luck with that.

21:21.265 --> 21:22.224
Anything else?

21:23.254 --> 21:24.361
The best part.

21:25.649 --> 21:27.606
Three fifty retail.

21:29.675 --> 21:31.396
A piece?

21:31.397 --> 21:34.183
You won't even sell one, you moron.

21:34.959 --> 21:40.850
Actually, my halitosis inflicted
competitor, three dozen sold this morning.

21:41.763 --> 21:43.380
Seriously dude?

21:43.918 --> 21:46.407
Well. Just because it has all
those healthy ingredients

21:46.408 --> 21:48.370
doesn't mean it necessarily tastes good.

21:50.219 --> 21:52.236
- Try it.
- No.

21:52.237 --> 21:53.196
I dare you.

21:53.255 --> 21:54.529
I'm all set. Thanks.

21:54.699 --> 21:56.159
Not willing to admit defeat?

21:56.478 --> 21:57.707
Not into hippie food.

21:58.616 --> 21:59.237
I'll try it.

21:59.237 --> 22:00.196
Michelle.

22:01.700 --> 22:02.957
What are ya doing?

22:03.925 --> 22:05.274
Don't eat that Michelle.

22:05.275 --> 22:06.467
Where's she going?

22:06.468 --> 22:08.078
Don't you dare eat...

22:08.205 --> 22:09.897
She's eating the doughnut.

22:10.267 --> 22:11.314
She'a eat...

22:11.853 --> 22:13.206
It's probably terrible.

22:27.317 --> 22:29.757
I can feel it tingling all over my body.

22:31.454 --> 22:33.238
That's heaven.

22:36.131 --> 22:40.253
Flanagan. I want you to try
Ollie's concoction. Stay right here.

23:00.652 --> 23:01.768
Hello Howard.

23:01.769 --> 23:03.470
Hi.

23:11.167 --> 23:15.103
Are you ready for my famous
macaroni and cheese with bacon?

23:15.764 --> 23:16.589
Yeah, Yes.

23:16.590 --> 23:20.348
Well? Why are you standing there?
Come in.

23:42.567 --> 23:43.737
What is it?

23:43.738 --> 23:45.687
Well, I call it the DoucheNut

23:45.688 --> 23:49.053
It's our new free range, whole wheat,
harvest scent sugar free doughnut.

23:49.438 --> 23:51.407
It looks like a regular doughnut.

23:51.739 --> 23:54.167
Hmm! Impressive, ain't it?

23:54.168 --> 23:56.037
Go ahead, I dare ya.

23:59.934 --> 24:02.241
Actually I am not. Go ahead
and have you bag that up for me.

24:02.481 --> 24:03.637
Take it home.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.304
I'll have it later.

24:05.305 --> 24:06.931
Still wondering why I'm doing here.

24:06.932 --> 24:10.433
Johnny, why don't you bag up Mr. Flanagan's
DoucheNut to go, would ya?

24:10.721 --> 24:12.543
You got it boss.

24:17.387 --> 24:18.837
What's a DoucheNut?

24:18.838 --> 24:21.053
Just a regular sugar doughnut.

24:21.054 --> 24:22.910
Gross.

24:25.558 --> 24:27.232
Here you are Mr. Flanagan.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.002
Oh, thank you so much.
You're so kind.

24:29.003 --> 24:32.651
I would love, love, love to stay around
and chit-chat all day with you all day.

24:32.651 --> 24:37.038
Perhaps catch some salmonella too,
but I have a high yoga class to go to.

24:37.492 --> 24:38.345
Toodles.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.706
Yeah, Goodbye.

24:40.388 --> 24:42.252
Good riddance.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.178
What?

25:06.965 --> 25:08.755
Did you pick up that doughnut from before?

25:08.995 --> 25:09.935
Which doughnut?

25:09.936 --> 25:11.653
The one I dropped.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.692
I kicked it over here, but it's gone.

25:17.135 --> 25:18.247
Maybe Cliff got it.

25:19.013 --> 25:21.959
Cliff wouldn't bend over to pick up
his mom if she was on the ground.

25:22.499 --> 25:24.441
Unless his mom was a quarter.

25:33.470 --> 25:34.823
Do you hear that?

25:35.543 --> 25:36.869
Hear what?

25:36.870 --> 25:38.491
Heavy breathing?

25:39.675 --> 25:41.416
Must be the coffee maker.

26:09.014 --> 26:11.363
Hey!
What's up?

26:14.886 --> 26:16.013
Hey man.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.028
You're in a good mood.

26:18.222 --> 26:20.061
Yeah? What's with the silly grin?

26:20.212 --> 26:22.523
It's just a beautiful night out.
That's all.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.647
Dude, you can't be back here.

26:25.647 --> 26:27.509
Yeah. Go away.

26:53.086 --> 26:56.658
We are... one.

27:07.005 --> 27:08.497
It's fat free, right?

27:16.851 --> 27:18.038
Oh my god.

27:19.566 --> 27:20.650
It tastes like...

27:20.870 --> 27:22.169
dog shit.

27:23.488 --> 27:24.904
Oh god.

28:17.291 --> 28:22.778
So much, smooth away the lotion...
So much, smooth away the lotion...

29:12.856 --> 29:14.581
Aw, shit.

29:14.899 --> 29:17.810
- Fred. Wake up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

29:17.811 --> 29:20.383
- The perp is gone.
- What?

29:20.384 --> 29:23.358
- Oh shit...
- What the hell happened?

29:24.974 --> 29:25.703
This is...

29:25.704 --> 29:27.176
Give me that man.
What are you doing?

29:27.176 --> 29:28.327
You do you mean? I am calling it in.

29:28.328 --> 29:31.757
Are you crazy? You can't just announce
to everybody we lost the perp.

29:31.758 --> 29:34.484
- Procedure man
- Now we could lose our jobs.

29:34.918 --> 29:36.226
Look, we got a dangeous man out there.

29:36.227 --> 29:38.930
- We gotta tell somebody
- Okay, just stop talking. Stop talking.

29:38.930 --> 29:40.644
Let's go find the perp.

29:42.813 --> 29:43.829
Alright.
You're right.

29:44.439 --> 29:46.247
Alright, you're right.

29:49.630 --> 29:51.108
Shit. Get the door Fred.

29:51.109 --> 29:53.212
Forget the door.
Let's find the perp.

30:05.401 --> 30:06.881
You got to do the double move.

30:06.882 --> 30:07.522
What?

30:07.523 --> 30:09.265
The double move.

30:09.626 --> 30:11.694
The double move.
Get up, let me show you.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.956
Why does he always hang out here?

30:14.107 --> 30:16.556
Would you keep it down?
He'll hear you.

30:17.618 --> 30:18.659
So.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.289
So, it'll hurt his feelings.

30:21.718 --> 30:23.604
He doesn't have many friends.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.049
Many, or any?

30:26.639 --> 30:29.934
Fine. I'm his only friend.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.870
He only comes here, because
there is nowhere else to go.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.682
What about his house?

30:36.032 --> 30:37.667
His parents have a sweet pad.

30:38.001 --> 30:39.516
Have you been inside?

30:39.517 --> 30:41.245
The place is like a museum.

30:42.290 --> 30:45.473
You have to take your shoes off at the
door, and you can't touch anything.

30:46.205 --> 30:50.183
His dad is always working, and his
mom pops Xanies like they're bon bons.

30:52.189 --> 30:54.021
I didn't know.

30:56.876 --> 30:58.849
He comes in my house,
even if I am not there.

30:58.850 --> 30:59.809
What?

30:59.989 --> 31:01.109
Hangs out with my mom.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.468
Dude. That's weird.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.065
Sha has a soft spot for him.

31:14.376 --> 31:16.838
So, is Veronica your girlfriend?

31:19.233 --> 31:20.997
That's out of nowhere.

31:20.998 --> 31:24.811
I mean. I'm just curious, because
I never see you guys together.

31:24.812 --> 31:27.239
Except for when she's in
here, asking you for money.

31:27.826 --> 31:30.170
She doesn't always ask for money.

31:30.869 --> 31:32.935
She comes to see me.

31:33.546 --> 31:35.042
Whatever.

31:36.277 --> 31:37.908
She's my girlfriend. Alright?

31:38.412 --> 31:39.864
Fine.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.537
She's just a private person.

31:42.927 --> 31:44.798
If you insist.

31:45.786 --> 31:48.489
Veronica doesn't like public
displays of affection.

31:53.468 --> 31:54.585
Why'd you stop?

31:54.681 --> 31:56.134
Why can't we just go to your place?

31:56.135 --> 31:57.762
I told you, my brother is at home.

31:58.181 --> 32:02.237
Besides, I'm crazy about you babe.
You're the clam in my chowder.

32:02.238 --> 32:05.338
Oh, you're so romantic.

32:22.253 --> 32:24.326
This can't be happening.

32:31.896 --> 32:34.029
The doughnut Shop.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.644
Welcome to Dandy Donuts.
How can I help you?

33:04.057 --> 33:05.923
We're here for the free doughnuts.

33:05.924 --> 33:07.442
Try the dumpster out back.

33:07.890 --> 33:10.028
Come on.
Show us the goods.

33:10.703 --> 33:11.998
Show me the money.

33:11.998 --> 33:14.478
He means your ta-tas.

33:14.794 --> 33:16.937
Yeah, Show us your boobs.

33:17.399 --> 33:20.091
Look guys. I don't want any trouble.
So why don't you just order?

33:20.092 --> 33:22.189
That's right.
You don't want any trouble.

33:25.117 --> 33:28.165
I tell you what.
Why don't go blow yourself.

33:28.166 --> 33:29.903
I am sure you have lots of practice.

33:29.904 --> 33:33.736
Oh ho! Slam!
Dude. She totally diss'd you.

33:33.867 --> 33:35.203
Wise Ass, huh?

33:35.662 --> 33:36.419
A little bit.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.967
Maybe, you just have the hots for me.

33:39.454 --> 33:41.172
And you want a taste.

33:41.627 --> 33:43.293
I just threw up in my mouth.

33:43.294 --> 33:45.331
Dude. Slammed again.

33:45.332 --> 33:47.218
She's totally owning you Conrad.

33:47.219 --> 33:48.482
Either order or...

33:49.427 --> 33:51.183
Did you say Conrad?

33:51.184 --> 33:53.250
Did they call you Connie, for short?
That's cute.

33:53.251 --> 33:54.850
- Connie
- Connie

33:55.169 --> 33:57.261
You're making look bad in
front of my boys, bitch.

33:57.262 --> 33:58.337
What did you say?

33:58.338 --> 34:02.059
Hey. Are you the manager?
This bitch is giving me lip.

34:02.060 --> 34:04.375
Dude. Call that again and
we're gonna have a problem.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.623
Oh yeah?

34:06.892 --> 34:09.205
Everyone is giving you lip today Connie.

34:09.206 --> 34:10.321
Shut the hell up.

34:10.518 --> 34:12.554
Two hits. Me hitting you
and you hitting the floor.

34:12.556 --> 34:13.481
Anytime you are ready pal.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.668
I'm right here princess.
Come at me!

34:15.668 --> 34:16.885
I got your back bro.

34:16.886 --> 34:18.915
Why don't you just
get before we call the cops.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.065
You eat me!

34:21.603 --> 34:23.235
Bonsai!

34:30.070 --> 34:31.029
Cover your eyes Howard.

34:35.835 --> 34:36.795
Get off me!

34:36.920 --> 34:38.143
Eyes!

34:48.549 --> 34:50.637
What the hell happened here?

34:50.638 --> 34:51.396
This bitch...

34:51.397 --> 34:52.505
You call her a bitch one more time...

34:52.507 --> 34:54.333
Johnny. That's enough.

34:54.599 --> 34:55.967
Go to the kitchen.

34:57.364 --> 34:59.648
They asked me to show them my ta-tas.

34:59.649 --> 35:00.981
I'm a witness.

35:01.927 --> 35:03.362
I wrote down my statement.

35:03.363 --> 35:05.285
She pepper sprayed me man.

35:05.463 --> 35:07.265
My eyes are burning.

35:07.266 --> 35:08.296
They were rude to Michelle.

35:08.297 --> 35:09.725
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm johnny's...

35:09.726 --> 35:11.449
Shut up, you.

35:12.011 --> 35:15.298
Michelle. Did you pepper spray
these customers?

35:16.289 --> 35:18.417
My eyeballs.

35:18.418 --> 35:18.976
Yes.

35:18.977 --> 35:21.833
Stop right there.

35:21.834 --> 35:22.844
You're fired.

35:22.845 --> 35:23.539
What?

35:23.540 --> 35:26.201
- Take that!
- Yeah, beotch.

35:26.202 --> 35:28.427
- What?
- You heard me. Get out.

35:28.428 --> 35:31.437
Johnny. Get these nice young
men a box of doughnuts.

35:31.438 --> 35:32.338
But these assholes...

35:32.339 --> 35:33.837
I don't care. Just do it.

35:35.196 --> 35:36.556
If Michelle goes, I go.

35:37.274 --> 35:39.221
- Think Johhny.
- Think nothing.

35:39.881 --> 35:41.511
I'm out.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.237
Hey. Michelle.

35:56.277 --> 35:57.740
Will you take me home?

35:57.741 --> 35:59.377
Yeah, of course.

35:59.664 --> 36:01.519
Um, I'll meet you at your place.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.234
Um, I'm taking Michelle home.

36:03.235 --> 36:04.576
I'll just hang with your mom.

36:04.577 --> 36:06.617
Oh. Isn't that nice?

36:11.192 --> 36:13.076
Here you go kids. On the house.

36:13.077 --> 36:16.131
Bullshit man. You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

36:17.078 --> 36:18.983
My eyes are still burning man.

36:18.984 --> 36:21.645
Stop bitching already.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.903
This place is a dump.

36:24.570 --> 36:28.021
I hope you get explosive diarrhea
you filthy animals.

36:52.933 --> 36:57.596
Bulgarian mail order bride dot com.
Here I come.

37:20.718 --> 37:22.095
Are you okay?

37:23.085 --> 37:26.204
I don't know. I just quit my job.

37:26.890 --> 37:29.403
It was a crappy job anyway.

37:29.404 --> 37:31.496
It was the only crappy job I had.

37:32.056 --> 37:35.559
Well, ask for it back.
I'm sure Cliff will say yes.

37:36.576 --> 37:37.894
Whatever.

37:37.895 --> 37:40.076
Seriously. Don't quit because of me.

37:40.077 --> 37:42.975
I'm not going to let
him treat you like that.

37:42.976 --> 37:45.822
You've been my friend
since the fourth grade.

37:46.362 --> 37:50.562
You mean, since I beat you up
in Miss Marino's class?

37:52.357 --> 37:54.188
You're never gonna let that go,
are you?

37:54.384 --> 37:56.696
Are you kidding?
Never.

38:00.592 --> 38:02.161
Thank you.

38:14.348 --> 38:16.542
Thanks for standing up for me.

38:18.027 --> 38:21.246
No one fires Michelle Kester on my watch.

38:22.064 --> 38:24.093
No, I mean those jerks.

38:24.373 --> 38:25.684
Oh.

38:25.978 --> 38:28.109
I don't know what got into me.

38:28.877 --> 38:32.198
When that dill weed called
you a bitch, I just snapped.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.321
I know. You went all butch on him.

38:35.322 --> 38:38.332
- Hey, I showed him, right?
- Yeah, you showed him.

38:39.426 --> 38:42.116
It's the last time I kick
someone's ass for you.

38:42.117 --> 38:45.223
Know what? I remember.
Me doing all the ass kicking.

38:45.224 --> 38:48.380
- I wiped the floor with that guy.
- Literally.

38:48.381 --> 38:50.701
I'm gonna kill you man.

38:56.724 --> 39:00.531
Hye uh. My scooter isn't working.
Can I get a ride with you guys?

39:02.240 --> 39:02.867
What?

39:02.868 --> 39:05.616
Dude. My scooter isn't working.

39:06.221 --> 39:08.967
What were you guys doing?

39:17.224 --> 39:18.845
Ow!

39:20.311 --> 39:21.704
What's the hold up? Get in.

39:21.705 --> 39:24.263
- I got shotgun.
- Uh-uh.

39:27.054 --> 39:29.688
Fine. Fine.
I'm going in the back.

39:36.895 --> 39:39.826
- What's your problem?
- Uh, Nothing.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.822
- Want me to drive?
- How's it going to make a difference?

40:02.823 --> 40:05.305
I don't know. I just thought
we shake it up a little bit.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.106
You're an idiot Fred.

40:10.602 --> 40:13.605
Ouch Dick, that really hurt.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.514
Your mom made bacon Mac-n-Cheese tonight.

40:22.581 --> 40:25.015
Do you just blurt out the first
thing that comes to your mind?

40:25.016 --> 40:26.273
Yes. Yes I do.

40:26.274 --> 40:27.069
How do you know?

40:27.070 --> 40:28.777
I had dinner with her tonight.

40:28.778 --> 40:29.738
Really?

40:29.739 --> 40:30.586
Oh, that's nice.

40:30.587 --> 40:31.917
Look out!

40:36.099 --> 40:37.780
You hit someone.

40:37.781 --> 40:39.167
Oh my god.

40:40.126 --> 40:41.662
I hit someone.

40:48.746 --> 40:51.274
Oh, this looks bad.

40:53.133 --> 40:54.893
He's not moving.

40:58.508 --> 41:00.748
Oh. Oh. He's alive.

41:01.580 --> 41:04.243
Hey. Hey are you alright?

41:04.244 --> 41:05.581
What the...

41:06.410 --> 41:08.180
What the heck?

41:10.531 --> 41:12.710
That's disgusting.

41:15.692 --> 41:17.769
He's wearing handcuffs.

41:17.769 --> 41:21.287
Maybe that's the guy that Rodgers and
Hammerstein arrested earlier?

41:23.602 --> 41:25.130
That doesn't look right.

41:25.798 --> 41:26.677
You think?

41:26.678 --> 41:27.919
Is he uh...

41:28.878 --> 41:30.102
Is he a zombie?

41:30.103 --> 41:31.788
What kind of question is that?

41:46.062 --> 41:47.578
Oh.

41:51.150 --> 41:53.071
Oh.
Nasty!

41:53.072 --> 41:56.357
Ah. That feels better.

41:57.497 --> 41:59.801
- Holy crap.
- You ain't kidding.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.358
- Is he dead?
- Geez Michelle.

42:11.359 --> 42:13.342
Well? Is he?

42:14.291 --> 42:15.467
I don't think he is breathing.

42:15.468 --> 42:20.041
Check his vital signs. See if he
has a pulse. Maybe he needs CPR.

42:20.042 --> 42:22.658
- Dude, you check for vitals.
- Fine.

42:26.083 --> 42:27.596
No. He's dead.

42:27.692 --> 42:29.995
Great work guys. Let's get out of here.

42:29.996 --> 42:31.881
We just can't leave him in
the middle of the road.

42:31.882 --> 42:35.107
He's an ex-con, who literally
just shat himself to death.

42:35.493 --> 42:37.245
I'm with Michelle on this one.

42:38.602 --> 42:41.336
You're not remotely disturbed by
the fact that I just hit this guy

42:41.337 --> 42:44.446
with my car at 60 miles an hour?
He survived.

42:44.447 --> 42:46.596
Looked like a zombie.
Then shat his guts out.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.353
Glowing green radioactive shit,
in case you guys missed that part,

42:50.354 --> 42:52.755
before plopping over and dropping dead.

42:55.118 --> 42:56.637
- No.
- No.

42:57.848 --> 42:59.269
Just get in the car.

43:34.436 --> 43:36.547
What in Sam Hill?

43:51.881 --> 43:54.981
- I'm starving.
- Have a doughnut man.

44:01.504 --> 44:03.811
Heh, dude, breath.

44:04.728 --> 44:08.366
Hey men. These things
just, look kind of freaky.

44:09.525 --> 44:11.421
They taste fine to me.

44:13.636 --> 44:15.076
Woa. Dude.

44:15.683 --> 44:17.023
The doughnuts just moved.

44:17.024 --> 44:19.516
- You high Conrad?
- I'm serious bro.

44:19.517 --> 44:21.995
I.. I don't feel too good.

44:22.811 --> 44:24.774
See, I told you man.

44:28.695 --> 44:31.427
He bro. Do you want me to
get you another doughnut?

44:31.428 --> 44:33.883
Come on man. Don't be a puss.
Come on.

44:34.597 --> 44:37.536
Uh. Ow. God.
Help me.

44:38.863 --> 44:40.569
Wh... What happened?

44:43.697 --> 44:45.836
Get back man. That shit can be contagious.

44:50.703 --> 44:54.174
On fire man... on fire.

45:02.486 --> 45:04.898
I hate doughnuts.

45:14.580 --> 45:16.514
I recognize that car.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.920
Is that the douche that
was giving Veronica a ride?

45:47.984 --> 45:48.915
Can I help you?

45:48.916 --> 45:50.039
Where's my girlfriend.

45:50.436 --> 45:52.661
- Who?
- Don't play dumb.

45:54.203 --> 45:56.672
Johnny? What the hell is this?

45:57.117 --> 45:58.574
I should ask you.

46:00.239 --> 46:03.375
Do you know what? I can't do this anymore.

46:03.517 --> 46:04.866
You're breaking up with me?

46:04.867 --> 46:07.144
Wow. This guy's slow.

46:07.144 --> 46:08.984
Watch it bitch.
What'd you call me?

46:08.985 --> 46:10.620
Enough Bobby. Get in the car.

46:10.621 --> 46:13.048
- I'm not done with you.
- Any time sweetheart.

46:13.049 --> 46:14.443
Get in the car!

46:16.362 --> 46:20.076
Look Johnny.
I'm not breaking up with you.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.377
I know.

46:23.279 --> 46:24.486
You love me babe.

46:24.487 --> 46:26.240
Ridiculous.

46:26.858 --> 46:30.887
No, I'm not breaking up with you,
because we were never together.

46:32.257 --> 46:33.076
What?

46:33.077 --> 46:34.557
Oh snap.

46:34.558 --> 46:39.822
You're a joke, Johnny.
I've been fucking Bobby for months.

46:40.667 --> 46:41.626
But...

46:41.658 --> 46:46.166
I just used you for money.
God, you're just a sap.

46:46.488 --> 46:48.322
A loser.

46:50.691 --> 46:52.608
What? You're not going to say anything?

46:53.373 --> 46:55.749
God, you really are a loser.

47:00.398 --> 47:03.264
Well at least have the balls
to say something.

47:13.353 --> 47:15.796
Whatever.
Let's skiddle.

47:37.967 --> 47:40.403
- What the hell?
- Impossible.

47:40.595 --> 47:41.654
What?

47:56.836 --> 47:58.556
I don't think this is a good idea.

47:58.748 --> 48:00.505
I'm in, Howard.

48:09.739 --> 48:11.650
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

48:11.651 --> 48:13.767
This can't be.

48:13.767 --> 48:16.252
The doughnuts are alive,
and mutated into...

48:16.253 --> 48:18.427
killer doughnuts.

48:20.758 --> 48:24.802
- I think my brain just melted.
- Thank god you have such few customers.

48:25.417 --> 48:27.936
- Mrs. Scolari
- Oh no.

48:28.945 --> 48:30.277
Get in the car.

48:35.974 --> 48:38.290
- Get in.
- You get in. I'm bigger than you.

48:38.291 --> 48:40.936
- Get in the car.
- We don't have time for this. Just get in.

48:40.937 --> 48:42.423
Fine.

48:44.820 --> 48:45.959
Hit it.

48:45.960 --> 48:48.241
Seat belts. Seat belts, seat belts.

49:28.526 --> 49:32.628
Mrs. Scolari? Mrs. Scolari, it's Johnny.
Can you hear me? Open up.

49:32.629 --> 49:34.079
I don't see her.

49:34.271 --> 49:36.387
- This can't be good.
- We have to get in there.

49:36.991 --> 49:39.613
- We have to go around to the side.
- OK.

49:54.173 --> 49:56.756
- Quick. Give me a boost.
- Are you crazy?

49:56.757 --> 50:00.166
- What? Do you have a better idea?
- Yes. Let's call the police.

50:00.167 --> 50:03.041
And tell them what? An army of
killer doughnuts is on the loose?

50:03.041 --> 50:04.747
We're wasting time.

50:04.748 --> 50:07.614
Okay. It's too dangerous. I'll go.

50:07.615 --> 50:10.188
Johnny. She's the lightest one.
We give her a boost,

50:10.189 --> 50:12.719
she goes up through the window,
down the stairs and lets us in.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.014
Exactly.

50:14.996 --> 50:16.278
Fine.

50:25.532 --> 50:27.868
I've got a bad feeling about this.

50:34.738 --> 50:36.169
Martha.

50:39.370 --> 50:40.817
- Martha!
- What!

50:41.316 --> 50:42.933
You're gonna give me a heart attack woman.

50:42.934 --> 50:44.692
What do you want? I'm right here.

50:45.333 --> 50:49.588
Those bunch of kids are up to no good.
Now call the police.

50:50.292 --> 50:52.596
What for?
They haven't done anything yet.

50:53.022 --> 50:55.620
For the love of Pete, woman.
I just saw the girl go in

50:55.621 --> 50:59.583
through the second story. And those two
hoodlums are downstairs just waiting

50:59.584 --> 51:03.781
to rob Mrs. Scolari.
Now call the cops.

51:03.782 --> 51:05.811
Okey Dokey.

51:14.898 --> 51:16.605
See, this is what happens
when I listen to you.

51:16.606 --> 51:17.887
Oh, this is all my fault?

51:17.983 --> 51:20.578
There's a criminal on the loose
and it is entirely your fault.

51:20.579 --> 51:22.206
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:22.478 --> 51:25.404
"13-A, 61"
"13-A, 61"

51:25.717 --> 51:27.362
Zero five, over.

51:28.100 --> 51:29.579
- Whatta ya doing?
- Shh!

51:29.579 --> 51:31.846
"75, a family dispute."

51:31.847 --> 51:33.114
Copy that. We're on our way.

51:33.115 --> 51:35.155
What are you doing?
We gotta find this guy.

51:35.179 --> 51:37.056
Man, this guy is
already gone, Dick.

51:37.057 --> 51:39.334
Okay, we can't go back to the
station empty handed.

51:39.335 --> 51:41.978
There's a dangerous criminal on
the loose and we got to find him.

51:41.979 --> 51:45.076
Dangerous criminal? He was polishing his
sword behind the sorority house.

51:45.077 --> 51:46.759
How dangerous can he be?

52:11.705 --> 52:15.039
Mrs. S, are you sleeping?

52:19.423 --> 52:23.367
Mrs. Scolari, are you alright?

52:44.023 --> 52:45.585
We have to get in there.

52:47.237 --> 52:48.915
Uh, I'm gonna get out of your way.

52:50.061 --> 52:51.489
Damn.

52:51.490 --> 52:52.535
Son of a...

52:57.222 --> 52:58.439
Dude!

53:04.794 --> 53:07.797
Wait. It's tempered glass.
It cannot be broken.

53:07.798 --> 53:09.759
We have to get in there.

53:13.786 --> 53:15.109
Really?

53:17.958 --> 53:19.764
Little help here...

53:22.435 --> 53:25.410
- Michelle.
- Eh! We have to get out of here.

53:25.411 --> 53:27.486
- What happened?
- Mrs. Scolari is dead.

53:27.487 --> 53:28.503
What?
How?

53:28.504 --> 53:31.964
- They ate her. It's horrible.
- Are you sure it was the doughnuts?

53:31.965 --> 53:34.707
I am 100 percent sure it was the doughnuts.

53:34.708 --> 53:36.659
- How?
- That.

53:40.738 --> 53:43.141
Don't make any sudden moves.

54:10.710 --> 54:12.195
Screw this.

54:37.436 --> 54:38.656
This way!

54:44.005 --> 54:46.083
Get 'em off me.
Get 'em off me.

54:54.925 --> 54:56.092
Howard.

55:02.088 --> 55:03.779
Set it and forget it.

55:35.356 --> 55:37.569
About time the cops come here.

55:39.202 --> 55:41.531
Turn around and down on your knees slave.

55:41.996 --> 55:44.599
Martha.
We're not doing 'matrix.

55:44.791 --> 55:47.948
Tonight is "M" Butterfly.

55:48.378 --> 55:51.321
Oh. Nuts.

55:52.388 --> 55:54.837
What is wrong with that girl?

55:59.754 --> 56:01.318
Woa, woa, woa, woa,
woa, woa, woa, woa.

56:01.319 --> 56:03.053
Put your hand in the air and don't move.

56:03.436 --> 56:05.956
Are there any suggestions
on how to do that?

56:05.957 --> 56:08.121
Whatta you doing. Put your gun down.

56:08.426 --> 56:11.365
Ma'am, come down from the window, slowly.

56:11.366 --> 56:14.154
Are you frick'n crazy?
A little help here.

56:14.155 --> 56:18.216
Don't talk back. Okay? And don't you
dare try to escape. We've got you covered.

56:30.910 --> 56:32.372
Winter's coming.

56:37.917 --> 56:39.911
There's too many of them.
We have to get out of here.

56:40.237 --> 56:41.877
Let's go to the side door.

56:44.868 --> 56:47.038
Alright ma'am. We need
you to calm down alright.

56:47.277 --> 56:49.297
And don't try anything crazy.

56:49.486 --> 56:50.564
Help!

56:51.775 --> 56:53.208
Put your hands in the air and don't move.

56:53.208 --> 56:54.571
You said that already.

56:54.806 --> 56:56.399
You alright? Can you get up?

56:56.400 --> 56:58.534
Yeah. Don't worry.
The ground broke my fall.

57:00.635 --> 57:03.940
Hey. You're the girl from
the doughnut shop, right?

57:03.941 --> 57:05.534
Yes sir.

57:09.884 --> 57:11.328
Run!

57:13.949 --> 57:15.271
What are you nuts?
You shooting at kids?

57:15.272 --> 57:16.456
He had a knife.

57:16.457 --> 57:18.693
Alright kids. Drop your
weapons and don't move.

57:21.211 --> 57:22.820
Come on.

58:00.198 --> 58:01.878
What's wrong with you two?

58:02.407 --> 58:03.867
Mrs. Scolari is dead.

58:05.370 --> 58:06.741
How did that happen?

58:06.933 --> 58:08.565
You wouldn't believe us if we told you,

58:08.566 --> 58:11.145
but believe me, we have to get out of here.

58:11.146 --> 58:13.461
Our lives are in danger.
They're still in there.

58:13.462 --> 58:14.726
Wait a minute. Who, who's still in there?

58:14.727 --> 58:16.147
Wait, there's murderers in there?

58:16.148 --> 58:17.732
Well, you see. We came here to...

58:17.733 --> 58:19.395
Yes. There's like ten of them.

58:19.396 --> 58:20.783
There's ten murderers in there?

58:20.975 --> 58:22.122
We need to call for backup.

58:22.123 --> 58:24.271
There's no time for that!
There's ten murderers in there!

58:25.701 --> 58:28.004
Crazy son of a bitch
is going to get us killed.

58:28.457 --> 58:29.957
Stay here!

58:44.190 --> 58:46.914
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait, they just told us to stay here.

58:46.915 --> 58:49.008
We just can't take off. They'll arrest us.

58:49.009 --> 58:51.097
- Do you always do what you are told?
- Yes!

59:00.476 --> 59:02.778
Call backup. Call backup now!

59:05.461 --> 59:06.796
You're right. Let's Boogey.

59:14.956 --> 59:17.911
- Make up your mind. Go.
- Let's get out of here.

59:38.172 --> 59:42.542
Martha. What's gotten into you?
It's not Star Wars night.

59:46.513 --> 59:50.267
What could possibly cause doughnuts
to become blood thirsty killers?

59:50.268 --> 59:51.482
I have no clue.

59:51.483 --> 59:54.752
There has to be a scientific reason.
Doughnuts don't just...

59:54.753 --> 59:56.657
That's it!

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:02.276
- What the hell are you doing?
- Uncle Luther.

01:00:02.277 --> 01:00:02.806
What?

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:05.626
Earlier today, uncle Luther was talking
about making the greatest discovery

01:00:05.627 --> 01:00:06.681
in the twenty first century.

01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:10.140
You think your crazy uncle came
up with a reanimation serum?

01:00:10.141 --> 01:00:11.972
There's only one way to find out.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.812
Calm down Debbie.
I'll be with you soon enough.

01:01:14.702 --> 01:01:16.760
Now now Debbie, no need to panic.

01:01:17.295 --> 01:01:20.600
This new antidote should
bring you back to normal.

01:01:21.356 --> 01:01:23.451
Or it'll just kill you again.

01:01:30.524 --> 01:01:34.034
Alright.
Come on Debbie.

01:01:34.813 --> 01:01:36.085
Come on.

01:01:37.075 --> 01:01:38.723
Yes.

01:01:38.724 --> 01:01:41.779
Eureka!
I've done it!

01:01:43.514 --> 01:01:45.200
Oh, you've done it alright you crazy loo.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.005
Johnny, I told you never
to enter my lair when...

01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:48.448
Yeah yeah yeah,
shut your pie hole.

01:01:48.449 --> 01:01:51.216
You've turned harmless
tasty doughnuts into...

01:01:51.217 --> 01:01:52.279
killer doughnuts.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.573
What are you talking about?

01:01:53.574 --> 01:01:56.896
Your serum has contaminated the
doughnuts, and they've come to life.

01:01:56.897 --> 01:01:59.735
That's impossible.
Who are you?

01:02:00.037 --> 01:02:01.307
Oh, it's possible alright.

01:02:01.308 --> 01:02:04.786
They ate Mrs. Scolari. And
at least three other people we know of.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.646
I'm Howard. Johnny's friend.

01:02:07.893 --> 01:02:10.000
How come I have never
seen you around here before?

01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:13.700
- I have dinner here every night.
- Really?

01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:16.983
Hey! Doctor Crazy! Focus.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:19.835
Yeah. What are we gonna do?

01:02:20.185 --> 01:02:21.931
Funny you should ask.
I've already done it.

01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:23.483
I've created the antidote.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:25.906
- No way.
- Yes way.

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:28.306
What you see before you is
a harmless little gray mouse.

01:02:29.598 --> 01:02:30.347
What about it?

01:02:30.348 --> 01:02:32.857
A few seconds ago it
was a crazed killer rat.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:35.994
- Brilliant.
- Yes.

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.575
It looks so normal.

01:02:39.397 --> 01:02:42.075
Aw. It's taking a nap.
How cute.

01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:49.572
I'd say your serum needs some tweaking.

01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:55.383
- Man, this is bullshit.
- I don't like it any more than you do.

01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:57.932
Who the hell steals a police cruiser?

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.412
It's bad enough we lost a perp tonight.

01:03:02.413 --> 01:03:04.084
We can't go back to the
station without a car.

01:03:04.085 --> 01:03:06.094
How much further does it say on the GPS?

01:03:06.095 --> 01:03:07.456
It says two miles.

01:03:07.457 --> 01:03:08.445
Do you want to switch yet?

01:03:08.446 --> 01:03:11.117
Just keep pedaling, jackass.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:17.623
I don't understand. It worked.
It changed Debbie back.

01:03:17.624 --> 01:03:20.522
Yeah, well, Debbie definitely changed.

01:03:20.523 --> 01:03:22.426
It does work. The rat's dead.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:25.765
You ignorant toad.
The point is not to kill the rat again,

01:03:25.766 --> 01:03:28.836
but to stabilize it. You don't
realize what I done here.

01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:30.372
You're in the presence of Jesus.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:33.235
Just give us enough of the pink stuff
so we can kill the doughnuts.

01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:35.097
Fine.

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:38.978
We don't have to inject it,
can't we just splash them with it?

01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:41.817
You fool. It has to get
into their blood stream.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:45.398
We're talking about doughnuts.
Doughnuts don't have a blood stream.

01:03:45.399 --> 01:03:49.425
Besides, doughnuts are made of dough.
Not organs and skin.

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.998
If we splash them, it will
penetrate the outer layer.

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:54.765
So what's the deal?

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:57.335
Do we spray these suckers with
it or do we have to inject them?

01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:02.006
My dear nephew. This is a very technical
question and requires lots

01:04:02.007 --> 01:04:06.434
of tests and documentation.
As you know the scientific method...

01:04:06.435 --> 01:04:08.010
You have no idea. Do you?

01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:09.476
Nope.

01:04:09.701 --> 01:04:11.730
It's worth a shot guys.

01:04:11.731 --> 01:04:13.274
So how do we find them?

01:04:13.627 --> 01:04:17.808
Well. Anytime you're looking for
bees, you always go to the hive.

01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:18.421
Huh?

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:22.361
Precisely. Ground zero.
The point of origin.

01:04:22.661 --> 01:04:24.642
The doughnut shop.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:28.703
Great.
Howard. Grab some pink stuff.

01:04:28.704 --> 01:04:30.115
Let's go.

01:04:31.487 --> 01:04:33.177
- I'm going with you.
- What?

01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:37.620
- I want to see them for myself.
- Fine. Let's get out of here.

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:40.674
- Shotgun.
- Uh-uh.

01:04:41.973 --> 01:04:43.971
Nice try buddy.

01:04:51.828 --> 01:04:53.941
We have no idea what we're
going to face in there.

01:04:53.942 --> 01:04:55.824
When you spray the doughnuts
with the antidote,

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.731
- if they don't melt...
- or blow up.

01:04:57.732 --> 01:05:01.284
Yes, or that. Then we inject them
with this.

01:05:01.285 --> 01:05:03.476
What if it's too many of them?

01:05:03.477 --> 01:05:05.273
We take care of them the old fashion way.

01:05:05.274 --> 01:05:06.805
Yeah.

01:05:12.153 --> 01:05:13.837
Do you play roller hockey?

01:05:59.412 --> 01:06:01.959
What if it doesn't work?
What if we spray them and it doesn't work?

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.594
I will inject them with my syringe.
Ha-haa!

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:07.813
You got that to work?

01:06:07.814 --> 01:06:09.082
We waste them!

01:06:15.394 --> 01:06:16.810
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:06:18.587 --> 01:06:19.744
Waste them!

01:06:20.654 --> 01:06:22.634
Bonsai!

01:06:26.419 --> 01:06:27.972
This is not working.

01:06:33.613 --> 01:06:35.331
There's too many of them.

01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:39.216
Not working.

01:06:40.925 --> 01:06:42.491
Oh shit.

01:06:45.563 --> 01:06:46.843
What are we gonna do?

01:06:50.025 --> 01:06:51.505
What are we gonna do?

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:59.897
The anti serum works.
We just don't have enough.

01:07:00.523 --> 01:07:02.639
Johnny. I got to get back to the lab.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:05.899
I've got to make more serum. It's the
only thing that's going to save us.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.754
We're not going to make it.

01:07:06.755 --> 01:07:08.870
We're not going to make it
Johnny. I have to tell you something.

01:07:08.893 --> 01:07:09.761
Not now Howard.

01:07:09.864 --> 01:07:11.055
I'm in love with your mom.

01:07:11.056 --> 01:07:11.545
What?

01:07:11.546 --> 01:07:12.697
I knew it!

01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:15.546
Wait. There's more.
I... we... kind of...

01:07:15.885 --> 01:07:17.716
I had sex with your mom.

01:07:21.493 --> 01:07:25.914
I'm sorry man. She's a kind,
beautiful sexually liberated woman.

01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:27.266
I think I'm gonna hurl.

01:07:27.267 --> 01:07:28.833
- Tell her I love her.
- What?

01:07:28.834 --> 01:07:31.158
I'm going to kill the doughnuts
that are escaping outside.

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:32.646
Bonzai.

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:34.077
- Hey!
- Howard! No!

01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:37.656
Get to the closet. It's our only chance.

01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:48.315
Aw, hell no!

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:52.961
Get the hell outta here.

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:55.384
I got splooged in my eye.

01:07:55.877 --> 01:07:58.088
Man down! Man down!

01:07:58.089 --> 01:08:00.313
Ah! Damn!

01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:06.363
- You got any grenades?
- Grenades?

01:08:06.364 --> 01:08:07.529
Oh, god!

01:08:08.359 --> 01:08:09.906
Do I look like I got any grenades?

01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:11.863
Never mind.
Just like home baby.

01:08:20.198 --> 01:08:22.702
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you... are you hurt?

01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:24.849
- Let me see.
- It's okay. It's fine.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.102
Okay. Um. Now what?
I don't know what.

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.794
- Well think!
- You think!

01:08:29.795 --> 01:08:31.064
You got us here.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.135
Your crazy uncle got us here.

01:08:33.136 --> 01:08:35.127
Alright, So we should just through
our arms up in the air and give up.

01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:36.087
Is that it?

01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:39.314
- No. We're not giving up.
- Oh great. You too.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:40.234
In denial.

01:08:40.234 --> 01:08:41.625
Why are you so angry at me?

01:08:41.626 --> 01:08:43.300
I'm not angry at you.
And why are you yelling at me?

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:44.996
Because I am angry! Alright?

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.354
You wanna know why? Because we
are about to become snacks.

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:49.135
For the freak'n snacks!

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.290
Or the fact. The fact that my mother
is sleeping with Howard.

01:08:54.481 --> 01:08:55.794
- My mother...
- Breathe.

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:58.267
I'm gonna be a therapist's dream
if I get out of here alive.

01:08:59.026 --> 01:09:02.671
Or, not to mention the fact, that
my imaginary girlfriend

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:06.305
was just using me for money.
You know? News flash Johnny.

01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:08.803
- Yeah. That actually bothers me.
- I am such a loser.

01:09:08.804 --> 01:09:11.013
I didn't see any of this coming.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:14.594
I mean. She brings her boyfriend over
this afternoon. And I was just.

01:09:14.595 --> 01:09:17.639
I was clueless. You know.
He called her babe.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.099
Right in front of me.
"Hey Babe"!

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.794
And I just stood there.
Pathetic! And believed here!

01:09:23.795 --> 01:09:25.157
Yeah. I got it!

01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:29.453
Does it bother that you have
such a pathetic friend?

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.245
You know, the worst part about this is,
is that after I am eaten,

01:09:36.246 --> 01:09:40.705
my little friends, Sprinkles and Glazed
out there. My mothers is going to be alone.

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:44.419
No. No, no no, no.
She won't be alone.

01:09:46.154 --> 01:09:47.752
You're right.

01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:53.759
Even after I am gone.
I will always be with her.

01:09:54.211 --> 01:09:57.155
No. She'll have Howard.

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:03.627
Why don't you just open the
door and let them eat me?

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.627
No Johnny!

01:10:08.014 --> 01:10:09.834
I would like you very much alive.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.891
- Okay
- Okay!

01:10:11.892 --> 01:10:14.596
Now close your mouth and help
me find a way out of this mess.

01:10:14.849 --> 01:10:16.595
Okay, let's go.

01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:19.316
Uh. Great, Okay. Um.

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:22.144
Maybe Luther will come back in time.

01:10:22.145 --> 01:10:23.697
Even... Even if he makes enough serum,

01:10:23.698 --> 01:10:25.339
there's no way he will be
back before we're dead.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.251
Right. Right, okay.

01:10:29.197 --> 01:10:30.890
Hey, hey I got an idea,

01:10:31.974 --> 01:10:32.731
What?

01:10:32.732 --> 01:10:34.075
The gas line.

01:10:34.699 --> 01:10:37.683
There's no way we would
survive an explosion.

01:10:37.684 --> 01:10:40.074
Look. I am sorry I yelled. okay?

01:10:40.075 --> 01:10:42.061
- Okay, it's fine.
- I was a jerk, with this.

01:10:42.062 --> 01:10:45.246
This is the only way to be sure.
No more killer doughnuts.

01:10:45.247 --> 01:10:48.234
No more doughnuts. Period.

01:10:48.235 --> 01:10:50.250
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

01:10:52.906 --> 01:10:54.906
I'm all out.
I'm all out.

01:10:55.098 --> 01:10:56.865
Damn it. Me too.

01:11:00.065 --> 01:11:04.288
Dick, it's been a pleasure serving
with you after all these years man.

01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:07.315
Yeah. And you've been a
galactic pain in the ass,

01:11:07.316 --> 01:11:09.595
but I wouldn't have it
any other way partner.

01:11:10.186 --> 01:11:12.332
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it!

01:11:23.753 --> 01:11:27.554
That's great, but how do
we survive the explosion?

01:11:27.746 --> 01:11:31.467
Uh... I'm still working on that part.

01:11:54.252 --> 01:11:55.914
Hey. Who farted?

01:13:08.087 --> 01:13:09.503
Hey.

01:13:11.113 --> 01:13:12.603
Good morning.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.487
Did you sleep okay?

01:13:17.924 --> 01:13:20.905
Yeah.
Better than Okay.

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:27.137
For a second I thought, uh...
everything was a dream.

01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:31.498
No no no. You definitely
weren't dreaming.

01:13:32.082 --> 01:13:34.141
We blew up Dandy Donuts.

01:13:35.439 --> 01:13:38.185
Right. That too.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:42.961
I will remember last night
for as long as I live.

01:13:43.715 --> 01:13:47.759
Yeah.
Killer doughnuts. Crazy.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.653
No, that's not what I meant.

01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:52.307
Well, make up your mind, will you?

01:14:02.316 --> 01:14:07.103
So... what now?

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:11.179
I think it's pretty obvious.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.822
No, it's not what I mean.
I mean like...

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:19.069
Okay, we've been friends
for a really long time. Right?

01:14:19.261 --> 01:14:23.165
And then, uh. Well.
This happened,

01:14:23.165 --> 01:14:26.415
and so now, like what does that make us?
Are we like friends with benefits,

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:27.001
or is this like...

01:14:27.002 --> 01:14:28.781
Shhh!

01:14:29.068 --> 01:14:31.881
Don't think so hard.
You might strain something.

01:14:38.579 --> 01:14:41.006
Ow!
What?

01:14:41.006 --> 01:14:42.411
You know what they say about payback.

01:14:42.412 --> 01:14:43.756
Payback for what?

01:14:44.335 --> 01:14:49.964
Forever being with that... Veronica.

01:14:49.965 --> 01:14:53.859
Oh. So, someone was a little jealous, hm?

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.325
Someone was a little blind.

01:14:55.326 --> 01:14:57.899
Okay, that's what I want to figure
out were we are, because the last

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.377
time I didn't think I ended up
with an imaginary girlfriend.

01:15:00.784 --> 01:15:02.528
Do I look imaginary to you?

01:15:03.407 --> 01:15:07.492
Well, let's see here.
You got a nose. You got two lips.

01:15:07.493 --> 01:15:09.287
- Alright, Alright.
- Let's see here.

01:15:10.898 --> 01:15:15.553
It was a crazy night for sure,
but nothing that happened

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:17.178
between us is imaginary.

01:15:19.305 --> 01:15:22.417
So let's take it slow.
See what happens.

01:15:24.373 --> 01:15:25.462
No.

01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:27.824
No?

01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:30.260
No.

01:15:31.596 --> 01:15:33.851
I love you. And that's that.

01:15:34.423 --> 01:15:35.768
You're my girlfriend.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.896
Ah, do I get a say?

01:15:42.792 --> 01:15:46.732
Michelle Louise Kester.
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.027
Uuuh...

01:15:50.218 --> 01:15:52.435
Oh come on.
Alright, you Know what?

01:15:52.531 --> 01:15:54.723
I have done so much for you,
since yesterday.

01:15:54.724 --> 01:15:58.929
I have beaten up three bullies.
I have stood up to Cliff.

01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:02.961
I have quit my job.
Oh yeah, and this other little thing.

01:16:02.962 --> 01:16:05.506
I battled killer doughnuts for you,
and not to mention

01:16:05.507 --> 01:16:07.779
the emotional turmoil I went through
trying to make sure you were safe.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.525
Alright, alright. Fine.
Your whining won me over.

01:16:11.894 --> 01:16:14.970
- Whatever works.
- Yes.

01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:16.880
I will be your girlfriend.

01:16:17.534 --> 01:16:19.125
Yessss.

01:16:23.726 --> 01:16:25.662
We should go visit Howard.

01:16:25.663 --> 01:16:28.320
Oh, is that what you're
thinking about right now?

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:29.719
Come on. He's your best friend.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.013
He's fine. Okay?
I mean, yeah, he's in the hospital,

01:16:33.014 --> 01:16:34.916
but he only has like minor burns.

01:16:34.917 --> 01:16:37.081
Johnny. He lost a testicle.

01:16:39.522 --> 01:16:41.870
Okay, we have all day
to visit him, alright?

01:16:41.894 --> 01:16:44.346
In case you forgot. I am
currently unemployed.

01:16:45.076 --> 01:16:48.140
As it turns out. I am unemployed as well.

01:16:48.141 --> 01:16:50.233
- Oh really?
- Uh-hm.

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:52.718
Maybe we should, uh.
Do something.

01:16:52.814 --> 01:16:54.765
What did you have in mind?

01:16:54.957 --> 01:16:58.662
Oh, for starters...
That's a nice shirt you're wearing.

01:17:00.363 --> 01:17:02.035
- This?
- Uh-hm.

01:17:02.649 --> 01:17:04.971
- You want it back?
- Yep.

01:17:05.163 --> 01:17:08.804
- Right now?
- I'm afraid so.

01:17:08.805 --> 01:17:10.102
Right now.

01:17:17.035 --> 01:17:18.678
John Blake Wentworth.

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:21.553
I don't want to hear anymore excuses.
You are cutting that grass today.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.129
Ma. Don't you knock?

01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:25.463
You heard me mister.
You get out of bed and cut that grass.

01:17:25.464 --> 01:17:26.462
- Now!
- Mom. wait!

01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:27.834

Good morning Mrs. Wentworth.

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.619
Hi Michelle. I thought...

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.930
Michelle is, uh... my girlfriend.

01:17:40.944 --> 01:17:42.366
I didn't know you had company.

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:43.551
Surprise.

01:17:44.183 --> 01:17:47.786
I... I promise I will uh,
I will cut the grass today.

01:17:47.787 --> 01:17:49.739
Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

01:17:49.891 --> 01:17:51.820
It is nice seeing you, Mrs. Wentworth.

01:17:51.821 --> 01:17:54.620
Nice to see you to, dear.
You could call me Emma.

01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:55.926
Okay.

01:17:56.194 --> 01:17:57.892
- Bye mom.
- Bye.

01:18:02.614 --> 01:18:05.420
She's going to cheer up Howard.
How sweet.

01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:06.496
Don't start.

01:18:06.688 --> 01:18:08.394
At least he has one good testicle left.

01:18:08.395 --> 01:18:09.933
Alright. That's it.
