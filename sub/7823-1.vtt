INVOLVING LASERS.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.720
- COOL.
- HOWEVER, IT IS EXPENSIVE.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.230
AND WE MUST INSIST ON

08:10.290 --> 08:12.260
IT USED TO BE A REAL
BOSS TATTOO.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.360
BUT MOM HAD TO SPEND
ALL THE CHRISTMAS MONEY
HAVING IT SURGICALLY REMOVED.

NO WORRY, HOMER.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.750
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO STRETCH
YOUR CHRISTMAS BONUS EVEN
FURTHER THIS YEAR.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.650
- HOMER?
- OH, YEAH.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.210
MY CHRISTMAS BONUS.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.690
HOW SILLY OF ME.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.059
THIS WILL BE

08:44.120 --> 08:45.890
THE BEST
CHRISTMAS YET.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.320
THE BEST ANY FAMILY EVER HAD.

THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME.

09:13.170 --> 09:15.140
HUH? OH.
I LOVE YOU, MARGE.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.840
YOU TELL ME THAT ALL THE TIME.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.170
OH, GOOD.
BECAUSE I DO LOVE YOU.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.780
I DON'T DESERVE YOU AS MUCH
AS A GUY WITH A FAT WALLET

09:20.840 --> 09:22.340
AND A CREDIT CARD

09:22.410 --> 09:25.210
THAT WON'T SET OFF
THAT HORRIBLE BEEPING.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.520
I THINK IT DOES HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH YOUR CHRISTMAS BONUS.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.850
I KEEP ASKING FOR IT,
BUT...

09:30.920 --> 09:34.090
MARGE, LET ME
BE HONEST WITH YOU.

09:34.150 --> 09:35.280
YES?

10:03.750 --> 10:05.620
OOH, PADS OF PAPER.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.250
I BET BART CAN THINK
OF A MILLION THINGS
TO DO WITH THESE.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.230
THAT JUST LEAVES
LITTLE MAGGIE.

10:11.290 --> 10:12.790
OH, LOOK!

HE'S THE ONLY FATHER I HAVE.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.520
THEREFORE,
HE IS MY MODEL OF MANHOOD

18:42.580 --> 18:44.280
AND MY ESTIMATION OF HIM

18:44.350 --> 18:47.220
WILL GOVERN THE PROSPECTS
OF MY ADULT RELATIONSHIPS.

18:47.290 --> 18:50.530
I HOPE YOU BEAR IN MIND
THAT ANY KNOCK AT HIM

18:50.590 --> 18:52.060
IS A KNOCK AT ME

18:52.130 --> 18:55.700
AND I AM FAR TOO YOUNG TO DEFEND
MYSELF AGAINST SUCH ONSLAUGHTS.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.120
MM-HMM.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.200
GO WATCH
YOUR CARTOON SHOW, DEAR.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.810
COME ON, BART.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.710
KISS THE TICKET
FOR GOOD LUCK.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.940
NOT THAT WE NEED IT.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.280
( <i>call to post )</i>

19:08.340 --> 19:10.540
Here comes Shirley
the mechanical rabbit...

19:10.610 --> 19:12.250
And they're off.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.140
COME ON,
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER!

19:14.220 --> 19:15.450
COME ON, DOG!
GO, MAN, GO!

19:15.520 --> 19:17.190
It's Whirlwind in the lead

19:17.250 --> 19:19.190
and coming up
from the left is Quadruped

19:19.250 --> 19:20.850
followed by Dog of War and Fido.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.360
GO, SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER!

19:22.420 --> 19:24.080
COME ON, GET THAT RABBIT!

19:24.160 --> 19:26.700
Dog of War coming up fast
on the outside.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.770
COME ON,
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER.
GO, GO!

19:28.830 --> 19:31.940
...and in last place
it's Santa's Little Helper.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.740
Dog of War third by a nose.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.310
DON'T WORRY, DAD.

19:35.370 --> 19:39.180
MAYBE THIS IS JUST FOR SUSPENSE
BEFORE THE MIRACLE HAPPENS.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.350
Homer:
COME ON, YOU STUPID DOG!

19:41.410 --> 19:42.580
COME ON, BOY!

19:42.640 --> 19:43.740
RUN, BABY, RUN!

19:43.810 --> 19:44.920
COME ON,
GET THAT RABBIT.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.650
GO, SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER!

19:46.710 --> 19:47.640
GO! GO!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.720
Whirlwind by a country mile...

19:49.780 --> 19:51.950
followed by Dog of War!

19:52.020 --> 19:53.020
OH!

19:53.090 --> 19:54.890
IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE,

19:54.960 --> 19:57.860
BUT I GUESS TV HAS BETRAYED ME.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.130
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
TILL OUR DOG FINISHES.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.440
AH, FORGET IT.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.440
LET'S GO.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.620
FIND ANY WINNERS, SON?

20:18.680 --> 20:19.820
SORRY, DAD.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.450
HEY, HEY, SIMPSON,
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

20:22.520 --> 20:23.620
WHIRLWIND!

20:23.680 --> 20:24.680
( <i>burping )</i>

20:24.750 --> 20:25.650
LET'S GO, DARIA.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.600
Man:
BEAT IT!

20:31.660 --> 20:33.800
SCRAM!
GET LOST!

20:33.860 --> 20:35.600
YOU CAME IN LAST
FOR THE LAST TIME.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.990
LOOK, DAD,
IT'S SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.070
AND DON'T COME BACK!

20:42.070 --> 20:43.340
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
NO, NO.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.160
GET AWAY FROM ME.
UH-UH.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.280
AW, CAN WE KEEP HIM, DAD?

20:49.340 --> 20:50.270
PLEASE?

20:50.340 --> 20:52.340
BUT HE'S A LOSER.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.740
HE'S PATHETIC.

20:53.820 --> 20:54.690
HE'S...

20:55.980 --> 20:57.080
A SIMPSON.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.290
( <i>snoring )</i>

21:01.360 --> 21:03.560
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL THE POLICE.

21:03.620 --> 21:05.050
HE'LL SOBER UP.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.700
YEAH, COME STAGGERING HOME.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.170
MM-HMM, SMELLING
OF CHEAP PERFUME.

21:09.230 --> 21:11.400
HOMER!

21:11.470 --> 21:12.440
WHAT?! WHAT?!

21:12.500 --> 21:13.770
LOOK, EVERYBODY,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.110
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.810
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.040
I DIDN'T GET MY CHRISTMAS BONUS.

21:20.110 --> 21:23.580
I TRIED NOT TO LET IT
RUIN CHRISTMAS FOR EVERYBODY

21:23.640 --> 21:25.710
BUT NO MATTER WHAT I DID...

21:25.780 --> 21:28.650
HEY, EVERYBODY,
LOOK WHAT WE GOT!

21:28.720 --> 21:29.890
A DOG!

21:29.950 --> 21:31.560
ALL RIGHT, DAD!

21:31.620 --> 21:33.460
GOD BLESS HIM.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.430
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IS POSSIBLE.

21:35.490 --> 21:38.330
IF HE RUNS AWAY,
HE'LL BE EASY TO CATCH.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.490
THIS IS THE BEST GIFT
OF ALL, HOMER.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.630
IT IS?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.730
YES, SOMETHING
TO SHARE OUR LOVE

21:43.800 --> 21:45.270
AND FRIGHTEN PROWLERS.

21:45.330 --> 21:46.460
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

21:46.530 --> 21:47.790
NUMBER EIGHT.
