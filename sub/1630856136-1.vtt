BASED ON THE NOVEL ELENA KNOWS
BY CLAUDIA PIÑEIRO

02:58.280 --> 03:02.920
ELENA KNOWS

03:07.640 --> 03:09.080
Come on.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.360
Help me out, Mom.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.920
You'll miss your appointment.
They're waiting for you.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.080
I don't want to go.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.840
You'll like it.
They'll make you look beautiful.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.200
Mimí said she'd give you a scalp massage.
You like those.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.600
And she'll give you a hair mask
after she dyes your hair.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.760
Is all that necessary, Rita?

03:33.840 --> 03:37.400
Only my toenail is bothering me.
You could cut it for me.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.440
Yes, that's true. I can do that.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.240
It kind of grosses me out,
but I can do that.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.600
But I won't cut your hair or dye it.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.040
I hate cleaning up after.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.880
It took me two days
to get the stains off the tiles.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.320
Did I pack the pills?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.000
Yes.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.600
Let's go.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.640
Come on.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.960
One, two, and…

04:11.320 --> 04:12.440
What's wrong?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.880
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.880
Is the pill not working yet?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.120
You took it 20 minutes ago.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.680
Why do you care? No one will see me.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.440
Look.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.680
Look!

04:34.560 --> 04:36.160
Do you see what I see?

04:36.680 --> 04:38.200
Do you see what I see, Mom?

04:53.920 --> 04:55.040
Did you pack my scarf?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
Rita!

05:26.840 --> 05:27.760
Ready?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.080
-Let's go.
-Don't.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.120
Hey!

06:07.920 --> 06:09.320
They drive like animals.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.680
Right. Yes. Exactly.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.520
Okay.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.320
Talk later.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.360
Hello!

06:30.680 --> 06:32.880
-How are you, Rita?
-Hello.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.920
Elena.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.360
-She's all yours.
-Hi, sweetie.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.840
Don't worry. We'll take good care of her.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.120
Be good, okay?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.680
Call me later.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.760
Good.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.440
Here. This chair over here.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.760
Easy.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.200
I'm having another grandkid!

07:03.280 --> 07:05.160
Congrats! When are they due?

07:05.240 --> 07:08.040
It's my daughter-in-law. In three months.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.160
Well… You know how she is.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.600
Can you picture
when our kids make us grandmas?

07:15.080 --> 07:16.800
My daughter is 43.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.840
So what?

07:18.560 --> 07:22.920
-She can't make me a grandma.
-Come on, Elena. That's nonsense.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.600
There was a woman on the news
who had a baby at 65.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.200
I am 65.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.520
What's next for Elena?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.360
-Face wax.
-Okay.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.320
Let me know if it's too hot, okay?

07:57.840 --> 08:01.320
Pame, how come the old lady is still here?

08:01.400 --> 08:03.440
Her daughter was supposed to pick her up.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.560
-Ready?
-Let's go.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.120
Bye, Mimí. See you tomorrow!

08:08.200 --> 08:09.160
Bye.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.960
Bye, Mimí. See you tomorrow.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.200
Bye.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.920
Rita, we're done with your mom.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.440
Are you almost here?

08:24.520 --> 08:25.920
Let me know.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.680
We're closing up already.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.840
-Hi, baby!
-Hi, sweetheart.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.760
-How are you?
-I'm good. You?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.320
Good. You're soaking wet!

08:41.400 --> 08:43.080
It's pouring out there.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.800
Can we drive Elena home?

08:45.880 --> 08:46.800
Of course.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.240
Let me get the lights.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.680
Don't worry, Elena.
Your daughter must be caught up somewhere.

09:13.960 --> 09:20.960
SALONE PABLO

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
Coming!

11:00.640 --> 11:01.880
Good evening.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.720
Is this the residence of Rita Alonso?

11:08.800 --> 11:11.360
What's wrong? Where is she?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.000
Is your husband home?

11:15.520 --> 11:16.640
She's my daughter.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.360
Are you alone?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.560
You'll have to come with us, okay?

11:43.560 --> 11:45.520
Yes, I know. We'll do that.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.440
Yes, I'll tell them.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.040
Is this your daughter, ma'am?

11:50.560 --> 11:53.640
Right. I'll talk to the coroner here.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.160
Rita Elena Alonso. Is this your daughter?

12:00.880 --> 12:01.840
Yes.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Right. Thanks.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.880
The DA says that if you're certain,
then there's no need, doctor.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.720
Tell him I am.
I'll report death by asphyxiation.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.440
Fine. Thanks, doctor.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.600
Excuse me, ma'am.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.840
The coroner has enough evidence
to release the body without an autopsy.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.880
Want us to call the funeral home for you?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.320
There won't be an autopsy?

12:27.400 --> 12:30.000
Just to save on paperwork. That's all.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.560
My daughter's death is not just paperwork.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.360
It'll take a few days to release the body.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.360
I want to know who did this to her.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.600
-Where will she be?
-We'll keep her here until we're done.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.160
Perform the autopsy.

12:54.160 --> 13:01.120
FUNERAL HOME

13:12.880 --> 13:19.840
MEMORIAL COMPANY
FUNERAL HOME

13:30.880 --> 13:34.640
Should I place them under her hands,
to show them off?

13:36.280 --> 13:37.720
Her boyfriend sent them.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.640
Show them off? Why?
He sent the cheapest flowers.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.240
Let me help, Elena.
Let's get that hair off your face.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.840
-It takes some guts, right?
-Oh, my God.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.560
Elena is so alone now.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.720
-Look at her, the poor thing.
-She left her so alone.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.840
Let me be, Mom.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.200
-Take this, honey.
-No.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.280
Come on, it will help.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.160
Elena, do you want a glass of water?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.400
-No, thanks.
-I'll get you water.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.160
Elena.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.880
We live two blocks away.
Call me if you need anything.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.560
What happened was a tragedy.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.240
What happened? Do you know?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.960
What could she have been thinking
to do something like this?

14:37.760 --> 14:40.080
A lot of people come through your shop.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.720
And people talk.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.760
You're a good listener.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.920
Will you help me?

14:50.960 --> 14:53.960
Elena, would you let me
pray for Rita's soul?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.920
I think Rita would like that.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.080
We'll say a prayer.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.280
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.160
Our Lord, Heavenly Father,
almighty and eternal God.

15:19.640 --> 15:25.480
To you we commend the soul
of your daughter, Rita.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.520
We ask you to forgive her sins

15:28.600 --> 15:31.320
in your infinite grace.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.480
For us, who are still left on this Earth,

15:35.560 --> 15:40.600
specially for her mother, Elena,
we ask you give us strength to accept…

15:40.680 --> 15:41.720
Guys.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.000
-Her face…
-You're being disrespectful.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.920
She looks better now she's dead.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.120
Wasn't Rita dating Father Juan?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.120
Yeah, she totally was.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.280
ORANGE JUICE

16:58.520 --> 16:59.640
Let's get going!

17:07.640 --> 17:08.760
Mom!

17:12.840 --> 17:13.960
Mom?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.560
Mom!

17:24.880 --> 17:26.360
Mom!

17:39.080 --> 17:40.320
Mom!

17:52.120 --> 17:54.360
No, don't. I can do it myself.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.840
-Let me have it.
-No. It's mine.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.160
It's for me. You have your own.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.800
But mine's wet.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.720
When I was your age,
I would run along this path.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.200
But you're not my age anymore.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.200
You're not your age either.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.280
We provide a social service here.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.440
I never forget all that you do.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.680
Elena. Come on in.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.040
Did you go to the courthouse?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.280
They're all useless.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.840
Yeah, we all know that.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.920
What other evidence do they need?

20:05.160 --> 20:07.360
There's a dozen witnesses.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.800
Everyone who was at church
attending mass that day.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.320
There's no way no one saw her.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.520
My daughter didn't kill herself.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.160
Make a copy of it.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.600
Give it back. Don't lose it.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.600
What are you doing?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.920
It's a common procedure.
Now we do it like this.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.400
You'll keep Rita's planner on your phone?
Have some respect!

20:42.480 --> 20:45.360
Listen, Elena. I already told you.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.640
I can't investigate anyone
if the case is closed.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.440
Don't bring him here.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.200
Go to the church. Talk to the priest.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.640
-You think it was Father Juan?
-He gave the sermon.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.320
With my daughter dead in the belfry.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.280
He didn't say anything.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.960
That's concealment.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.520
The chair and the rope were in the church.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.400
A chair is a pretty common item.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.200
He saw her last.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.840
And no one is questioning him.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.760
Concealment and incitement.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.560
-Should I press charges?
-No.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.600
No, Elena.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.800
Just relax. I'll see what I can do.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.160
Why don't you ask your daughter's friends?

21:38.240 --> 21:40.280
Talk to her inner circle.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.280
She didn't have one.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.480
Pablo Almada.

21:47.920 --> 21:52.440
He claims he was doing a cash audit,
and that he doesn't know anything.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.840
What kind of man
doesn't know anything about his partner?

21:58.920 --> 21:59.760
Well,

22:00.600 --> 22:03.200
someone must have known your daughter
apart from you.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.520
-Will you make copies or should I take it?
-Leave it.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.040
Elena!

22:36.800 --> 22:37.640
Elena?

22:41.320 --> 22:42.840
Pablo, I didn't recognize you.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.560
New shoes?

22:46.600 --> 22:48.400
A birthday present from my mom.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.040
I deposited your pension
to your bank account.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.240
Who authorized you?

22:55.840 --> 22:59.000
It was a favor.
I was allowed because of your situation.

22:59.840 --> 23:00.880
What situation?

23:00.960 --> 23:04.400
If you sign an authorization,
you won't have to worry every month.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.200
Since when do you care
about me being worried?

23:08.040 --> 23:09.720
I've always cared about you.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.320
I know I should have stopped by,
but I couldn't.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.760
I miss her too much.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.280
Missing her is not enough.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.720
What else can we do?

23:21.520 --> 23:23.480
Whatever lets you sleep at night.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.480
-Do you need me to go with you?
-No, I don't need that.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.720
A plague of diloboderus abderus beetles
is spreading in Buenos Aires.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.120
This species may appear harmless,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.320
but its presence in large quantities

23:47.400 --> 23:50.280
has an impact on the local biodiversity.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.880
The tiny insects have caused
irreparable damage to parks and…

24:50.840 --> 24:54.600
May your life be beautiful

24:55.200 --> 24:59.920
May you have lots of happiness

25:00.000 --> 25:04.800
May you dream and dream
And while you live

25:04.880 --> 25:09.800
May all your dreams come true

25:10.680 --> 25:13.040
Come on, Mom.
Blow it, it's burning my fingers!

25:13.520 --> 25:14.360
Wait.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.680
Let me think of a wish.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.880
You don't believe in that stuff.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.480
Hurry, come on!

25:21.600 --> 25:22.680
Blow again!

25:24.120 --> 25:24.960
Try harder!

25:25.920 --> 25:27.160
Even harder!

25:55.120 --> 25:56.720
Here's the birthday girl!

25:57.360 --> 25:59.560
Marga! Come here!

25:59.640 --> 26:01.520
Smack her!

26:01.600 --> 26:05.280
Marga! Marga!

26:06.600 --> 26:07.800
Here, take this!

26:08.600 --> 26:09.800
Come on!

26:09.880 --> 26:11.520
Come on, get up!

26:13.360 --> 26:14.400
Is there a party?

26:14.480 --> 26:15.440
Elena.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.840
How nice to see you, Elena.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.240
Hello.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.920
I was about to call you.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.120
Why? Do you have any news?

26:28.200 --> 26:29.040
No.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.480
We're putting up
a memorial plaque the students built

26:32.560 --> 26:34.160
by Rita's rosebush.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.040
Her rosebush?

26:36.800 --> 26:39.680
She planted one next to the Virgin Mary.
It's blooming.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.720
She had a green thumb.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.800
She wouldn't even
water the plants at home.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.800
It's just a simple ceremony
with us teachers,

26:52.320 --> 26:54.640
but maybe you could invite her friends.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.440
Maybe an old classmate?

26:57.880 --> 26:58.720
Isabel.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.280
What's her last name?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.960
Isabel Herrera.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.960
That's right.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.680
I heard she's a lawyer now,
like her father.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.600
-She went to university?
-Yes.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.720
Don't worry.
I'll ask someone for her number.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.480
-What's important is that you're there.
-Okay.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.800
It's next Wednesday, right at start time.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.480
-I can pick you up if you want.
-No, thanks.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.280
Is that Sacotti's daughter?

27:27.360 --> 27:28.560
I'll go talk to her.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.680
She's just a child, Elena. Don't.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.240
She's not very childlike.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.160
All of us here loved Rita so much.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.320
Look, I have to go.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.240
-See you on Wednesday?
-Yes.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.160
Thanks.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.560
-Oh, right.
-What?

27:47.640 --> 27:50.800
No, you're nuts. That's just nonsense!

28:05.160 --> 28:10.480
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

28:14.360 --> 28:17.040
That senior who got pregnant
was brought here.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.560
-Which one?
-Her father's in the military.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.360
I heard if you abort a baby,
you'll hear their cries forever.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.440
Rita! Don't stand there. Keep walking.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.240
Go.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.760
One, two, three…

28:37.120 --> 28:38.880
The boys are there. Let's go.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.000
You go.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.840
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.440
You're not going with your friends?

28:50.520 --> 28:51.920
They're not my friends.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.240
She does their homework, so they like her.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.120
Which she copies from you.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.760
That's why you're top of the class
and she's second.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.080
Mom.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.440
There's Father Juan.
He must have the donations. Can I go help?

29:08.520 --> 29:10.320
Don't stay too long with him.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.240
He smiles too much for a priest.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.920
-Be nice, please.
-I am nice.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.120
Do you need help?

29:20.200 --> 29:22.480
Hi, Rita. Sure. Thanks.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.800
Hello, Elena.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.600
UNFUCKABLE

30:24.680 --> 30:28.920
DRY CLEANING

31:15.560 --> 31:19.720
JULIETA

31:38.080 --> 31:41.440
MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM ISABEL, JULIETA, AND HER GRANDPARENTS

32:22.920 --> 32:23.800
Out!

32:25.240 --> 32:26.120
Go.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.000
Come on, leave. Out!

32:28.080 --> 32:30.000
Outside.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.000
Out. Go. Now!

32:34.480 --> 32:35.480
Out you go.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.840
I love him. I want to keep him.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.600
Again?

32:45.680 --> 32:48.160
I told you not to bring cats in my house!

32:48.640 --> 32:51.360
-Please. It's just a baby.
-It's a street cat.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.560
-They carry diseases.
-But we found him at my house.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.320
That's not your house anymore.
I told you not to go there.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.480
-I'll take care of him. Please.
-Give it.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.440
I won't let him inside.
He'll stay in the balcony.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.760
He won't make any mess. I'll care for him.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.040
-Don't throw him out!
-Don't!

33:15.120 --> 33:18.400
Ask your mother to pick you up
or take the train home right now.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.600
She's my friend.
You said she could stay the weekend.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.840
She's not your friend.

33:22.920 --> 33:26.280
Don't you realize she only comes over
so she can fuck her boyfriend?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.600
That one is not my daughter's.

33:48.680 --> 33:53.000
I remember when she brought it in.
It had a wine stain. We cleaned it.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.040
-No. You're wrong.
-That's impossible.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.680
I'm not taking it.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.040
How about this?

34:01.120 --> 34:03.280
It was in the jacket pocket.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.440
RESIDENTIAL HOME
HOME FOR THE ELDERLY

34:13.480 --> 34:15.720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.360
Do you have another bill?

34:37.480 --> 34:38.880
Tape it together.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.000
It's crooked.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.400
My partner will fix it right up.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.600
-Ready?
-Yes.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.040
What is this?

35:08.120 --> 35:10.360
Can you believe it? It's preposterous.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.240
"Justice for Rita?"

35:12.320 --> 35:15.280
-We can't let her do this.
-That woman is…

35:15.960 --> 35:18.920
Maybe we should call
City Hall or something…

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
That woman can't do this.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.200
There she is. She thinks I don't see her.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.440
You have to do something, Father.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.400
When you use it, it reduces fine lines.

35:32.480 --> 35:37.240
It sort of works
like hyaluronic acid fillers, you know?

35:37.320 --> 35:39.400
It lasts a while, but then it…

35:39.920 --> 35:41.520
-I'll go.
-No, I'll go.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.320
Morning, ma'am. What can I help you with?

36:01.120 --> 36:04.120
This prescription
is over the authorized amount.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.560
Ask your doctor
to write one for 30 capsules.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.760
I take four a day.
Will I have to come back next week?

36:09.840 --> 36:12.280
I can't authorize more than one pack

36:12.360 --> 36:14.840
unless the script specifies
it's for chronic care.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.880
But it says here in the script
that she needs two packs.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.800
Right.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.120
I can see that,
but it doesn't say it's for chronic care.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.600
But Parkinson's is an incurable disease.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.480
It's a chronic condition.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.920
I know. I have two other scripts here.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.920
You can authorize those.

36:37.400 --> 36:41.440
No. I can't authorize two prescriptions.
It's not possible.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.400
Can't you make an exception?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.760
Look at her.

36:47.480 --> 36:48.600
Okay, listen.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.880
You need to ask the doctor to write
"chronic care" on the script.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.560
It needs to be written by hand.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.040
You'll get a hand to your face
if you keep making me go through red tape.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.440
-I'm just doing my job.
-Obedience is no excuse.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.880
If your superior gives you a stupid order
and you follow it,

37:09.960 --> 37:11.160
you're stupid too.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.400
And let me tell you, stupidity…

37:15.160 --> 37:16.400
it's incurable too.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.160
Even if it's not written by hand.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.840
Your prescription, ma'am.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.320
Ask your doctor to fix it.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.560
You can't forbid me
from entering the station.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.080
What if I get mugged?

37:34.960 --> 37:36.480
You ruffled a lot of feathers.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.600
Getting a banner was wrong.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.760
What choice did I have?

37:41.840 --> 37:44.680
My superiors don't like to get scolded.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.720
I can do it myself!

37:50.800 --> 37:52.600
I'm just trying to help. Relax.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.000
Maybe it was an outsider.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.240
Did you check the hotel?

38:04.320 --> 38:05.200
Help me.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.960
What motive would a stranger have?

38:13.040 --> 38:16.320
I said an outsider, not a stranger.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.760
You're right.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.440
If you can't question that Sacotti girl
because she's a minor,

38:23.920 --> 38:25.520
question her parents.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.120
I don't think it was her, Elena.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.480
That girl…

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
she vandalized my house with insults.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.200
She used to drive Rita crazy at school.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.960
She might be a minor…

38:40.000 --> 38:41.360
but she hurts people.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.640
But she's not a killer.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.040
Otherwise, not many people would be left.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.480
I have to go.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.440
Inspector.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.760
It was raining that day.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.400
There was a storm.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.200
To reopen the case,
you'll need to get a lawyer.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.040
How are you doing, Elena?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.600
-Do you have help?
-I don't need anything.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.040
There are nice places.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.720
You don't need to be a senior citizen.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.760
If you show your disability certificate,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.360
your health insurance will pay for it.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.520
-You want to put me in a nursing home?
-No, Mom.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.080
Sit down, come on. Listen to the doctor.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.840
Parkinson's cannot be measured
with a blood count or a laboratory test.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.240
It's different for every patient.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.520
From what I can see,

41:05.480 --> 41:10.680
I can confirm your mother
has an atypical type of Parkinson's.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.280
We used to call it "Parkinson-Plus."

41:14.600 --> 41:15.560
Plus?

41:16.480 --> 41:17.320
Yes.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.000
But "plus" means "more."

41:21.280 --> 41:22.240
Yes.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.480
Is there more?

41:23.560 --> 41:24.720
It seems so, child.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.600
Do you know what you’re talking about?

41:27.680 --> 41:30.760
Rita, it's not the doctor's fault.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.040
It's not mine, either.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.720
Do you think
you can ask this woman for more?

41:38.480 --> 41:42.680
You'll have to find someone
to look after her while you're at school.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.120
How long are you at work?

41:47.720 --> 41:49.880
Eight hours. I work a double shift.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.400
I see.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.760
The sooner you get some help, the better.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.080
For both of you.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.880
Nursing home. Hello?

42:14.840 --> 42:16.240
Hello? Hel--

42:18.880 --> 42:21.280
…call us on the phone.

42:21.760 --> 42:25.720
The topic? "I missed my chance."
What regrets do you have?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.160
If you could go back…

42:27.240 --> 42:28.440
Ma'am!

42:30.720 --> 42:32.680
Do you have any clothes you can donate?

42:32.760 --> 42:36.800
Now, let's hear a song
from the Jackson Souvenirs,

42:36.880 --> 42:37.960
"Night falls."

42:38.040 --> 42:39.600
Anything you can spare?

42:41.920 --> 42:43.200
Ma'am!

42:47.960 --> 42:49.000
Ma'am!

42:51.520 --> 42:53.160
God bless you!

43:09.280 --> 43:11.200
"Blue, clear weather."

43:11.280 --> 43:14.400
"Purple, variable. Pink, rainy skies."

43:17.520 --> 43:20.000
Why don't you buy one for Father Juan?

43:22.720 --> 43:24.600
Does pink mean clear weather?

43:25.440 --> 43:26.760
Check the underside.

43:27.400 --> 43:28.720
Oh, let's see.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.440
"Variable" means cloudy.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.760
What about stormy?

43:32.840 --> 43:33.920
Pink.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.000
So how do you…?

43:39.080 --> 43:42.240
Do you need to place it on a windowsill?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.560
It doesn't matter.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.240
Some people get degrees for that, Rita.

43:47.080 --> 43:47.920
This one.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.720
That looks fun.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.600
My feet hurt.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.120
What is it?

44:13.520 --> 44:14.720
What's wrong?

44:16.400 --> 44:18.040
I have something in my shoe.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.600
Can we take a cab? My boots hurt too.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.600
You mean your feet hurt.

44:25.520 --> 44:30.200
I told you not to buy regular shoes
with those feet of yours.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.920
Will you have to give them away?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.960
There's a taxi stand right there.
Let's go, okay?

44:40.200 --> 44:41.800
Can you walk faster?

44:43.680 --> 44:45.360
We'll get struck by lightning.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.360
We should have taken a cab.

45:22.400 --> 45:23.840
I'm freezing.

45:26.160 --> 45:30.720
You keep spending money on trinkets,
like it's so easy for you to earn it.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.840
What? It's just a small treat.
I'm treating myself.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.480
I don't want that in my home.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.400
It's a present. It's not for home.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.800
For your friend at the bank?

45:47.760 --> 45:49.120
Pablo is my boyfriend.

45:49.600 --> 45:54.080
Rita has a boyfriend! She has a boyfriend!

45:54.160 --> 45:56.600
Rita, come on! I'm just joking.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.360
You're never going to keep a man
with that temper.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.960
There is a memorial for Rita
tomorrow at school, if you want to go.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.440
Something about a plant.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.960
It starts at eight.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.840
If it runs late,
you'll be late to the bank.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.760
I'll come pick you up.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.240
That's not where the coffee set goes.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.200
It makes no difference, Rita.

46:53.160 --> 46:56.280
You need to put things back
the way you found them.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.080
Those go in the upper cabinet.

47:05.560 --> 47:06.400
These ones.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.840
When I get my own place,

47:11.920 --> 47:14.400
I'll keep all the dishes
where I can see them.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.520
Up on shelves, no doors at all.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.360
They'll gather dust and dirt.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.520
Pablo found an empty lot nearby.
It's a good price.

47:29.360 --> 47:33.440
He already got a loan approved.
It helped that he works at the bank.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.720
Some people wait years for a loan.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
We'll build it little by little.

47:39.880 --> 47:41.080
Two bedrooms,

47:41.160 --> 47:42.960
a nice yard…

47:51.120 --> 47:52.320
What about your jacket?

47:53.400 --> 47:56.080
Will you wear it on the train
or should I put it away?

48:00.360 --> 48:01.560
It's hot outside.

48:04.800 --> 48:08.480
If you ever get your own place,
put everything on a high shelf,

48:08.560 --> 48:11.040
or your hunchback boyfriend
will get worse.

48:12.360 --> 48:14.160
Don't call him a hunchback.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.240
-What's your problem?
-Careful!

48:17.320 --> 48:20.880
We're going to get married at City Hall
and then at church.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.080
Why would you want to get married?

48:23.560 --> 48:25.320
He's a good man who loves me.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.800
Okay. If that man makes you happy…

48:59.240 --> 49:00.480
Just go, Pablo.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.640
We don't really know each other.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.160
I can't see you like this.

49:07.240 --> 49:08.760
Let me help you, Elena.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.760
I need a lawyer. Do you know anyone?

49:16.360 --> 49:17.200
No.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.400
You can't live on your own.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.000
Yeah, right.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.600
That's why my daughter
was going to put me in a home,

49:29.080 --> 49:30.800
so you could take over my house.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.680
No. Why would you say that?

49:33.760 --> 49:35.040
Rita would never do that.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.840
So what is this?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.320
I don't know what to say, Elena.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.320
Rita and I…

49:57.920 --> 49:59.920
we broke up two weeks before.

50:00.920 --> 50:01.920
She didn't tell you?

50:03.600 --> 50:04.760
She left me.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.160
She had…

50:10.600 --> 50:12.200
What? Another man?

50:13.080 --> 50:14.120
Another man?

50:15.640 --> 50:17.040
No. She had you.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.320
She never mentioned a nursing home.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.760
I wanted us to have our own place.

50:26.480 --> 50:29.960
I got approved to rent a house.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.200
So we'd be close by.

50:31.680 --> 50:35.040
But she didn't want to. She couldn't.

50:43.320 --> 50:44.760
-Campos?
-Here!

50:44.840 --> 50:46.880
-Gutiérrez?
-Here I am!

50:46.960 --> 50:48.960
-Fasano?
-She went to the bathroom.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.720
-What?
-She'll be right back.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.040
Okay. Good.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.280
Get to class.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.720
Great, you're here early. Good job.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.000
Fran!

50:58.080 --> 50:59.200
-No.
-Yes!

50:59.280 --> 51:01.120
-Rizzo?
-Here I am!

51:03.680 --> 51:05.680
Sacotti, you're late again.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.480
Come on, please. Please.
I won't be late again.

51:08.560 --> 51:12.000
-I'll call your parents--
-The teacher's not even here yet.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.920
Come on. Please.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.960
Okay, go in. Take off your jacket.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.160
-This one?
-Yes.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.000
Hi! That's new, right?

51:26.760 --> 51:27.840
It's so cute.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.360
Do you remember me?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.640
I'm Cristina Menta's daughter.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.040
-You did bookkeeping for her.
-I remember.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.800
Want some coffee? It's fresh.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.480
Did you call Isabel Herrera?

51:58.040 --> 51:59.280
There. That's it.

52:20.320 --> 52:21.680
There's the class book.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.320
The second-grade class book.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.520
We've been looking everywhere. She had it.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.880
-I told you.
-Right, you did say that.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.200
Rita was so organized, so tidy.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.800
She never misplaced anything.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.040
IN MEMORY OF RITA ALONSO

52:54.120 --> 52:56.680
Catch it at your chest. With both hands!

52:58.240 --> 52:59.440
Over your head!

52:59.520 --> 53:01.440
It's pretty. Did you make it?

53:01.520 --> 53:03.640
With a classmate. She missed school today.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.800
-It looks great.
-Thanks.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.200
What is it? Looks like marzipan.

53:09.160 --> 53:10.480
It's modeling clay.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.480
Margarita is such a treasure.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.800
She helps out at the church too.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.160
She's always there.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.880
I have to go to class now. Excuse me.

53:23.520 --> 53:24.360
Elena.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.120
Thank you for coming, Elena.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.480
You can leave through there. It's closer.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.800
I'll pull the car around.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.000
Margarita, please help Elena.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
This way.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.360
Guys, you need to focus.

53:51.640 --> 53:53.920
Why do you let that Sacotti girl
pick on you?

53:54.960 --> 53:56.360
I told our school counselor.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.360
Next time, pull her hair.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.480
Make her fear you.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.200
But that might hurt her.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.680
Doesn't she hurt you?

54:08.760 --> 54:10.840
I have to go. Have a good day.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.040
Take care of yourself.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.480
Stop going to church that often.
Those church people will brainwash you.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.480
Here, Mom.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.920
I can do it myself.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.080
There we go.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.160
Done.

55:00.480 --> 55:03.160
This humidity makes my hair look awful.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.320
Get a haircut.
You're too old for long hair.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.760
Does he really need to go
through all this trouble?

55:12.840 --> 55:14.200
He's doing it for me, Mom.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.960
And in the distance

55:23.040 --> 55:25.080
You'll be there

55:26.000 --> 55:27.120
By my side

55:29.680 --> 55:32.480
When you look for me

55:32.560 --> 55:34.320
You'll find me

55:35.320 --> 55:36.720
There for you

55:36.800 --> 55:38.240
Oh, it's "by my side."

55:38.320 --> 55:39.680
I like "there for you."

55:39.760 --> 55:43.680
And we'll lose track of time

55:44.280 --> 55:46.280
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.400
Thank you.

55:52.080 --> 55:56.080
This number, the account number
from our insurance company,

55:56.160 --> 55:59.520
does not match the one
on her medical record

55:59.600 --> 56:02.240
because the doctor's ones
look like sevens.

56:02.320 --> 56:06.080
The insurance company kept
the copy that was clearer, so…

56:06.600 --> 56:10.160
-They said it would rain this morning.
-I heard it would be tonight.

56:11.120 --> 56:11.960
At eleven.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.240
-Really? Eleven?
-It's good.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.480
Sleeping to the rain is nice.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.440
Oh, please…

56:27.800 --> 56:29.520
It's our third time here.

56:29.600 --> 56:31.680
We're from out of town. Please.

56:35.680 --> 56:36.640
Here you go.

56:39.720 --> 56:40.800
Is that it?

56:40.880 --> 56:41.960
Yes. That's it.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.800
We always have such trouble…

56:48.520 --> 56:50.840
At the doctor's office, the pharmacy…

56:51.960 --> 56:53.240
Our health insurance.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.680
I know.

56:54.760 --> 56:57.480
They want to tire you out
so you'll stop asking.

56:57.560 --> 56:58.840
Don't fall for that.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.920
Thanks a lot, doctor.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.480
-Here, Mom.
-I can do it myself.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.160
What's wrong?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.320
They treated us kindly.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.480
Here it is!

58:12.560 --> 58:14.320
It's warm, but it will do.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.200
-Get an ice bucket. We'll add ice.
-Okay.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.280
-This one?
-Yes.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.160
-You try. You're stronger.
-Okay.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.200
You need a good technique, not strength.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
Are you okay?

58:46.080 --> 58:48.160
-Whoops!
-Jeez.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.360
-Well, let's celebrate!
-Right.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.520
Celebrate, Mom!

58:54.000 --> 58:55.680
I'm driving, so just a sip.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.200
Okay.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.080
To all my efforts.

59:01.760 --> 59:04.760
We got lucky. The doctor was nice.

59:08.360 --> 59:11.720
Mom, you'll see. Everything will be okay.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.560
Things will get easier.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.960
-Thanks.
-I'm using my hands, sorry.

59:25.040 --> 59:25.920
It's okay.

59:27.520 --> 59:29.840
Do you like these sandwiches?

59:29.920 --> 59:30.960
Of course.

59:32.680 --> 59:35.600
I bought ones with hearts of palm.
You like those?

59:37.280 --> 59:38.320
What are you…?

59:45.520 --> 59:46.760
Why is she like that?

59:49.520 --> 59:51.160
You should be proud of yourself.

59:54.880 --> 59:55.800
Thanks.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.400
Thank you.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.760
Thank you, thank you.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.160
Mom!

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.560
Mom, help!

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.000
Let go of me!

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.120
I want to go. Let me go!

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.400
-You'll regret it forever.
-What do you know? I'm sure.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.200
Where are you going?
All the girls who go there regret it.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.080
Sit down.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.040
Mom, she wanted to kill it.
I found her just in time.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.720
-I don't want it.
-You'll regret it.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.680
I don't want to have it. I won't!

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.840
Bring a sedative.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.120
Here. Take this. Open up.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.000
She needs to go home.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.880
No. Don't take me home.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.480
It's going to be okay. I promise.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.560
Ready?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.120
Let's go.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.360
Let's go.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.000
Let's go, Mom!

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360
Come on, Mom!

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.480
Why did you take him to the vet?

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.400
He's having back issues.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.560
What is it?

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.600
-We don't know.
-Oh, wow.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.400
But it's been like a month.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.000
Poor Blacky.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.520
-Hello.
-Hello, Elena.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.920
-Can I have a cigarette?
-I don't have any. The boys do.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.360
Here.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.120
Light it.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.480
Should we get going?

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.320
-If we're late again…
-Let's go.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.520
Come on. You can't miss any more class.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.600
I want to talk to you.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.600
I have to go to class.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.000
Why did you paint "unfuckable"
on my wall?

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.920
It wasn't me.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.720
My daughter would come home crying
because of the mean things you did to her.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.040
-Let me go.
-Why Rita?

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.880
-Let me go, you crazy old bitch!
-Why Rita?

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.840
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.560
-What did she do?
-Are you okay?

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.360
Come here. Get away from her.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.360
You old hag!

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.520
Fucking old bitch.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.080
I don't know what you heard,
but that girl is trouble.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.640
-File this, please.
-Okay, leave it here.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.120
We talked her father
into not pressing charges.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.000
For your own good,
stay away from the school.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.200
Right, because they're rich.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.800
So you listen to them.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.680
To the police and the court,
it's crystal clear.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.680
Your case is closed, ma'am.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.440
Jesus. Your daughter was sick.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.360
Why don't you talk to Benegas?

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.560
-He wasn't my daughter's doctor.
-Is that so?

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.440
Why did he make a statement
about her medication?

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.200
What?

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.320
I can get you psychological help
if you want.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.280
I'm not crazy.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.000
And my daughter was murdered!

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.400
The police told me Rita came to see you.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.840
Was she sick?
Did she have the same disease as me?

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320
Come on in, Elena.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.200
Rita came to see me, yes.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.920
But it was to talk about you.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.400
She was very upset.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.680
I prescribed an antidepressant
and referred her to a therapist.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.520
You prescribed my daughter
antidepressants?

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.440
Yes.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.560
That's why I went to the police
and told them about it.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.040
I thought it was relevant to the case.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.360
My daughter was not depressed!

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.560
She woke up early each morning,
went to work.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.160
She was strong as an ox.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.040
Come here.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.360
Is there not a choice?

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.480
I don't understand.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.880
You know what I mean.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.000
Your mother wants to live.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.760
Your mother will live.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.600
I'm not talking about my mother.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.720
If there is more than this…

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.080
I'm not sure I want to.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.720
Elena needs you now

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.840
just like you needed her as a child.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.760
You'll have to get used to
being your mother's own mother.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.880
The Elena we once knew

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.600
will disappear.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.160
She's going to slowly
turn back into a baby.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.360
What are you saying, doctor?

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.200
My mother won't turn into a baby.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.520
Babies, they grow…

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.560
At some point, they stand up.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.120
They learn to walk.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.960
They eat on their own, learn to talk.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.120
My mother will not be a baby.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.440
And I don't know if I can be
the mother you're asking for.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280
We'll help, Rita. Don't worry.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.080
Help who?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.320
My mother or me?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.040
Let's see.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.040
Let's try these.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.840
Take half a pill in the morning.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.080
We'll adjust the dosage later
as we deem necessary, okay?

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.800
Elena.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.520
Elena.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.360
Are you here to pray?

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.800
I'm not here to pray.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.080
I want to know what happened that day.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.720
-Juan! Come with us!
-Come!

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.880
-Come with us!
-What is it?

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.240
-What happened?
-There's someone dead in the belfry.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.800
-Come here.
-What do you mean dead?

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.760
-Here, you'll see.
-Slow down.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.200
She's tied up above the bell.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.160
Okay, wait. No yelling in our church.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.480
Let's go.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.680
Careful. You're going to make me trip.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.760
Look. See? You didn't believe me!

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.080
She wasn't with me.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.720
When I got there, she was dead.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.600
The rope was there
from the last time we cleaned up the dome.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.560
There's no secret to it,
apart from Rita's reasons.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.360
Rita would never go to church
on rainy days.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.920
Why not?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.360
Don't you know?
She was afraid to get struck by lightning.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.200
Please, Elena.
You can't believe that stuff.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.400
-It was raining.
-Enough with the rain.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.560
It's a sin to think you know everything.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.800
Why did you hide her?

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.200
There was nothing to do for her but pray.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.560
I called the police.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.040
I asked them to come
after the seven o'clock mass.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.080
Please, come after mass.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.240
Yes, thank you.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.160
For our congregation.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.080
Okay.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.840
Yes. That's okay.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.480
Thank you.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.480
Don't stay here today.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.800
Go with your parents.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840
Go.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.240
"Ye are the salt of the earth."

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.760
"But if the salt have lost its savor,

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.040
wherewith shall it be salted?"

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.560
"It is thenceforth good for nothing,

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.440
but to be cast out
and trodden under foot of men."

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.320
"Ye are the light of the world."

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.080
"Let your light so shine before men,
that those who come in may see the light."

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.840
"And it shineth unto all
that are in the house."

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.720
"For whatever is hidden
is meant to be disclosed,

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.360
and whatever is concealed
is meant to be brought out into the open."

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.360
So is the Word of God.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.240
What was that?

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.000
Father!

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.840
-What was that?
-I don't know.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.440
She stopped coming to confession.
At least with me.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.120
You took advantage of her.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.000
Don't disrespect me, Elena.
Or your daughter's memory.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.680
I never raised her hopes.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.360
But you indulged
her fantasy of eternal paradise!

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.920
Do not blaspheme.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.520
Losing a loved one is painful.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.280
Especially in a case like this,
where everything gets mixed up.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.160
What gets mixed up?

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.160
Pain.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.200
And anger.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.680
We as Christians know
that our bodies do not belong to us.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.760
The Church condemns some actions
people take towards their own lives.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.560
Euthanasia, abortion, suicide.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.560
I understand, Elena.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.240
How can you understand?

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.480
Isn't there someone to shine your shoes?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.480
TRAVEL

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.960
ISABEL HERRERA
474 SOLDADO DE LA INDEPENDENCIA

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.480
SYMPTOMS

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.680
LIVING WITH PARKINSON'S
TIPS FOR PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.600
MAR DEL PLATA

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.480
Let's go, Mom!

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.760
Come on, Mom!

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.720
We are approaching Constitución.
This is the final station.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.400
The train to La Plata
is departing from platform five.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.480
The train to La Plata
is departing from platform five.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.720
There you go.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.040
Let me help. What is your name?

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.080
I'm okay.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
Are you alone?

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.200
-Help me. I want a cab.
-Are you alone?

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.680
A cab? No, we called an ambulance.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.080
Hold on. I'll help you.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.320
Okay, there we go. Up.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.920
Are you sure?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.880
Let me get your umbrella.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.760
Here we go.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.120
-Let go.
-Okay. I'll let go.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.160
She'll sit in the front
because she feels a bit dizzy.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.080
Okay.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.520
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.480
Take care.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.600
Nueve de Julio, Libertador,
Figueroa Alcorta.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.160
Then the Planetarium.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.440
It's going to be okay.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.280
I don't want to go.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.600
It will be okay. I promise.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.360
Are you okay?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.560
-Need help? Should I pull over?
-No.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.560
I'm fine.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.400
Isabel.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.280
I'm Rita's mother. Elena.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.120
Elena?

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.800
-Can you open up?
-Sure.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.200
-See you.
-Bye.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520
Why are you here?

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.440
I couldn't get your number.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.000
I didn't know if I'd find you here.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.320
He scared me.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.880
-Did I break it?
-No.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.480
How old is your daughter?

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320
Julieta is 25 now.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.520
What are you doing here, Elena?

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.640
Settling a debt.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.520
A debt?

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.520
You don't owe me anything.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.560
No.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.280
You owe Rita.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.080
-She saved you.
-What?

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.520
I don't like to go around making demands,

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.880
but you're young.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.800
My body won't let me do anything.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.080
You're pretty and a lawyer.
They'll listen to you.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.680
I'm in family law, not criminal law.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.520
-You could, for Rita's sake.
-No, I can't.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.040
You don't feel indebted to her?

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.640
Thanks to Rita, you had a daughter.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.920
You have a family.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.480
I didn't want to be a mom.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.400
But…

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.320
When they placed her in your arms?

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.880
-When she called you "Mom?"
-She calls me Isabel.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.280
Don't you remember?

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.440
I went to get an abortion.
She dragged me out.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.280
You gave me sedatives,
and brought me here on a train.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.280
We brought you to your parents.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.720
You knew they wouldn't let me do it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.080
Rita knew too.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.080
If you regret it so much,
why send us those pictures?

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.120
I didn't send the pictures.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.040
My mother took them
and then sent them to everyone.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.120
My parents raised Julieta.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.480
I love her, but not like a daughter.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.240
No, no.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.680
I have to wait for my pills to work.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.080
You didn't want a lawyer.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.720
You were looking for comfort.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.280
What do you want to hear?

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.120
That Rita didn't kill herself?

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.120
That she wouldn't have left you alone?

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.320
It was raining that day, dammit!

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.600
Rita was absolutely terrified…

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.720
terrified of storms!

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.840
She would always stay home!

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.400
She never went to church!

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.720
Something scared her more than the rain.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.720
What do you mean?

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.440
She killed herself
to stop looking after me?

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.520
No.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.120
I wasn't a bad mother.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.840
I was always there for her.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.920
You did your best.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.640
I want to live.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.200
In spite of this body.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.080
And not having Rita.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.400
He likes you.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.160
Want some tea?

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.200
Yes.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.280
Hey, you.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:21.880
What is it?

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.520
