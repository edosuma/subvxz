WEBVTT

00:14.362 --> 00:15.667
- You know,
you were so right.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.974
The light on this side
of the room, way better.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.803
- I've been right about quite
a few things since you left.

00:20.846 --> 00:24.241
- I wanna give you a choice
between two doors.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.504
Well, by all means.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.506
And you have
until security gets here

00:28.550 --> 00:31.683
to give me
as many choices as you like.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.556
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
What's behind door number one?

00:34.599 --> 00:36.036
Resign.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.124
Collect your golden parachute

00:37.167 --> 00:38.386
or whatever it is
they promised you,

00:38.429 --> 00:40.953
and leave this hospital
in the hands

00:40.997 --> 00:44.174
of any of the dedicated and
passionate department chairs

00:44.218 --> 00:46.350
who love this place
with their entire being

00:46.394 --> 00:48.526
and will run it
with dignity and grace.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.354
- Okay, let's just skip ahead
to door number two.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.356
- Okay, door number two,
you cling to a job

00:52.400 --> 00:53.792
that I know you don't like,
don't want,

00:53.836 --> 00:56.708
only took for money,
and I stay here in New York,

00:56.752 --> 00:57.927
away from the woman
that I love,

00:57.970 --> 00:59.189
the life that I love,

00:59.233 --> 01:01.235
and rip you from this hospital
by the roots.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.889
And believe me,
you will be begging for mercy

01:03.933 --> 01:05.413
once I unleash the full--

01:10.548 --> 01:11.680
Excuse me.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.598
Hi, baby.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.078
- So I was just walking
into work,

01:18.121 --> 01:19.688
and I passed that gazebo.

01:19.731 --> 01:20.906
Do you remember?

01:20.950 --> 01:21.951
<i>When it was raining</i>

01:21.994 --> 01:23.126
<i>and one thing led to another--</i>

01:23.170 --> 01:24.693
- Yes, yes, I do.
I would very much love

01:24.736 --> 01:26.303
to relive
wet-clothes-gazebo-day,

01:26.347 --> 01:27.913
but I'm right in the middle
of giving Veronica

01:27.957 --> 01:29.611
- that ultimatum--
- Oh. Go, go, go.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.743
Yes, give her the full
Mad Max.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.136
Love you, bye.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.443
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

01:35.486 --> 01:39.142
Yeah, so rip you from the--

01:39.186 --> 01:40.143
Sorry, where was I?

01:40.187 --> 01:41.623
You're gonna take me down,

01:41.666 --> 01:44.539
nothing's gonna stand
in your way, whatever it takes.

01:44.582 --> 01:48.020
- Whatever it takes
to make sure that you,

01:48.064 --> 01:51.023
Veronica Fuentes,
are going--

01:51.067 --> 01:52.068
Ow, ow!

01:52.112 --> 01:53.243
Guys, okay, I'm going.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.853
You win. Hey, take it easy.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.161
- Sorry about this,
Dr. Goodwin.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.424
No, no, don't be, Joe.

02:00.468 --> 02:03.253
Everything went exactly
as planned.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.474
Did you find it?

02:06.517 --> 02:08.128
- I literally had my hand
in a drawer

02:08.171 --> 02:10.130
when Veronica walked in,
but Yahtzee.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.261
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.741
Now, start scouring, okay?

02:12.784 --> 02:14.612
We're looking for anything
that says "deal points."

02:14.656 --> 02:16.440
- How did you even come up
with this?

02:16.484 --> 02:17.963
- Well, the only way
to oust Veronica

02:18.007 --> 02:19.095
is with a seat on the board.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.096
And the only way
to get back on the board

02:20.140 --> 02:21.445
is to be employed
at the hospital.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.055
And right now, I can't even
get past the front doors

02:23.099 --> 02:24.274
without security
kicking me out.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.928
So I figured,
let's get creative.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.364
Urgent Medicine Incorporated?

02:27.408 --> 02:29.845
- UMI, they're a bargain-rate
trauma clinic

02:29.888 --> 02:31.673
that Veronica franchised out
to a third party.

02:31.716 --> 02:34.502
And technically, they remain
a separate entity

02:34.545 --> 02:36.591
fully outside
of Veronica's purview.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.984
- We're gonna need
more than that.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.247
How's this for more?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.639
According to this deal,

02:41.683 --> 02:43.902
UMI negotiated exactly one seat

02:43.946 --> 02:46.557
on the board of New Amsterdam.

02:52.563 --> 02:53.521
Hey.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.634
- Do you remember
the Nick's Grocery Massacre?

03:19.677 --> 03:21.418
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
From the news.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.072
The shooting a few years back.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.553
Six years ago...

03:25.596 --> 03:28.991
and five months,
four days.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.907
But who's counting, right?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.518
You were there?

03:37.565 --> 03:38.870
- I worked at Nick's
after school.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.785
I was a stocker.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.961
Okay.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.050
And what do you remember?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.791
- I was--

03:46.835 --> 03:50.447
I was working
with this guy Marco

03:50.491 --> 03:51.840
in the cereal aisle.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.798
He was doing impressions

03:53.842 --> 03:56.410
of the different characters
on the boxes.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.326
And then I heard the bang,

03:59.369 --> 04:03.460
and I looked back, and...

04:03.504 --> 04:06.333
Marco was bleeding.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.769
His chest.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.512
I don't know
where it came from.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.993
I tried to help him,
but the wound was so big,

04:15.037 --> 04:16.778
and he died really fast.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.912
And I was kind of
in shock, I guess.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.524
Yeah.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.222
Then I heard the screams,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.702
and I knew
the shooter was coming,

04:27.745 --> 04:31.314
so I got on the floor,
and I pulled Marco's body

04:31.358 --> 04:34.361
on top of me
and pretended I was dead too.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.713
He came right up to us.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.369
And I thought, "This is it."

04:42.412 --> 04:44.632
Then he just walked away,

04:44.675 --> 04:48.070
shot everyone else, and...

04:48.113 --> 04:49.506
here I am.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.597
- I gotta say, it sounds like
you're processing that day

04:53.641 --> 04:55.251
about as well
as can be expected.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.644
- Yeah,
that's not why we're here.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
Oh.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.346
Okay, well,
then why don't you--

05:03.390 --> 05:05.827
what brings you in?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.002
Tell him.

05:10.571 --> 05:14.009
- I wanna help you. I do.
But I don't think this is--

05:14.052 --> 05:15.532
Just tell him, Dad.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.713
Dr. Frome,

05:22.757 --> 05:26.630
Nick's Grocery
was a false flag operation.

05:28.415 --> 05:32.593
The so-called shooting...

05:32.636 --> 05:33.898
it never happened.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.473
- Teyarnie?
- Yeah. Who are you?

05:43.517 --> 05:45.432
I'm Dr. Reynolds.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.129
- What happened
to the spine doctor?

05:47.172 --> 05:50.567
- Well, we got the results
from your scans

05:50.611 --> 05:53.962
and the source
of your back pain.

05:54.005 --> 05:57.444
Unfortunately, it is a tumor
on your pancreas.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.923
A tumor?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.490
I'm afraid so.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.840
- I've been driving long haul
16 years.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.886
Backaches come
with the 18-wheeler.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.017
Are you sure?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.454
I am.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.500
And it needs to be removed,
or it could prove fatal.

06:10.544 --> 06:14.504
- Okay.
Well, let's get on it, then.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.506
There's the challenge.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.509
This is an extremely
specialized procedure

06:19.553 --> 06:21.859
that requires
an endocrine surgeon,

06:21.903 --> 06:25.297
and currently,
we don't have one.

06:25.341 --> 06:28.388
- Well, can you bring one in?
- Well, that's the plan.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.519
You know, I've got word out

06:29.563 --> 06:31.478
to every hospital
in the tristate area,

06:31.521 --> 06:33.915
but these specialists, they...

06:33.958 --> 06:36.396
are almost as rare
as your tumor.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.745
Dr. Reynolds?

06:41.444 --> 06:43.098
One sec. Okay.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.233
- We can schedule
Teyarnie's surgery today

06:48.277 --> 06:49.974
at New Amsterdam.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.498
Wait, how?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.413
- Turns out, we do have
an endocrine surgeon on staff.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.762
Who?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.764
- I completed
my Endocrine Surgery Fellowship

06:56.807 --> 06:59.114
at the Icahn School of Medicine
at Mount Sinai.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.422
Made me who I am today.

07:09.472 --> 07:09.690
.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.387
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, hon.</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:13.302
- So it is raining cats
and dogs,

07:13.345 --> 07:15.217
and we are thoroughly soaked.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.481
Wet clothes are clinging
to every curve of your body.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.178
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.529
- I'm sorry, you wanna stop me
before the part

07:22.572 --> 07:24.574
where we cracked
the gazebo banister

07:24.618 --> 07:26.097
with our entangled bodies?

07:26.141 --> 07:28.056
- Only because now might not be
the ideal moment

07:28.099 --> 07:30.841
to recount us vandalizing
a local heritage site.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.930
I'd like to hear it.

07:32.974 --> 07:36.891
Oh. Hello...everyone.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.501
- Let me give you
a call later, okay?

07:38.545 --> 07:39.807
<i>- Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

07:39.850 --> 07:43.550
<i>My apologies to...everyone.</i>

07:55.562 --> 07:56.867
Hello?

07:56.911 --> 07:58.086
I'm busy.

07:58.129 --> 08:01.263
- Oh, busy?
There's nobody here.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.525
Not enough docs.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.135
- Well, that's perfect,
actually,

08:04.179 --> 08:08.575
'cause I'm here
for a job interview.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.537
- I sure do love
that idea, sweetie.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.540
<i>- I knew you would, Dad.</i>

08:17.584 --> 08:21.457
Oh! My doctor's here, hon.
Say hello.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.025
<i>- Thank you for taking care</i>
<i>of my dad.</i>

08:24.068 --> 08:25.505
My pleasure.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.115
Okay.

08:27.158 --> 08:30.597
I'll call you later.
Love you.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.598
<i>Love you too.</i>

08:34.601 --> 08:36.864
- Your daughter
seems very sweet.

08:36.907 --> 08:40.563
- She just played me the song
for our father-daughter dance.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.609
One of my favorites.

08:42.652 --> 08:43.958
How are we feeling?

08:44.001 --> 08:46.177
Has your pain level
decreased at all?

08:46.221 --> 08:50.181
- No.
Still a pressure always there.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.314
But let's hear it
for consistency, right?

08:54.403 --> 08:55.535
Ooh.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.146
- Mr. Aronova,
late-stage osteosarcoma

08:58.189 --> 09:00.496
is an incredibly painful and--

09:00.540 --> 09:02.106
Lewis, please.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.849
I mean, you're getting me
to that wedding after all, huh?

09:05.893 --> 09:08.548
- Of course, Lewis.
- Mm.

09:08.591 --> 09:11.376
- But there is only so much
that we can do.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.728
- I promised Marissa I would
walk her down that aisle.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.687
My body just needs to hold on

09:17.731 --> 09:19.384
three more months.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.781
- I can look
into upping your dosage

09:24.825 --> 09:27.610
and possibly a spinal infusion,

09:27.654 --> 09:29.699
but you should know
that the only guarantee

09:29.743 --> 09:31.527
we can give you
for these treatments

09:31.571 --> 09:34.095
is that your pain
will increase.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.880
I just need...

09:36.924 --> 09:38.882
three more months.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.673
- So Teyarnie Jordan's
been moved to pre-op.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.152
You just have
to pick out an OR.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.067
- Oh, okay, okay.
Slow down, cowboy.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.070
I won't even consider operating
until I've run every MRI,

09:53.114 --> 09:55.029
every CAT scan,
every blood lab.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.683
- No, no, no,
that could take days.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.685
Teyarnie Jordan
needs surgery now.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.861
- May I remind you
that only one of us

10:00.904 --> 10:02.427
is a specialist in this field?

10:02.471 --> 10:05.343
And in order to do my job,
I need to be 100% certain

10:05.387 --> 10:07.215
that this tumor
is even amenable to resection.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.782
- It doesn't take an expert
to know

10:08.825 --> 10:11.219
that Teyarnie Jordan's tumor
is a time bomb.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.221
She could have a GI bleed
at any second.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.788
Your hesitation could kill her.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.529
- Dr. Reynolds, I am not
hacking into a woman's torso

10:17.573 --> 10:19.314
without sufficient preparation.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.884
- You know, Dr. Fuentes,
we all know surgeons

10:23.927 --> 10:27.235
who try to get back in the game
after some time away.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.020
Doctors who became
administrators

10:30.064 --> 10:32.457
who, at one point, wanted
to step back up to the table

10:32.501 --> 10:34.285
but, once they got there,

10:34.329 --> 10:37.071
realized they're not
doctors anymore.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.594
- Is that what you think
this is?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.074
I think that Teyarnie Jordan

10:40.117 --> 10:42.293
shouldn't have to risk her life
for us to find out.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.646
- Excuse me,
where are you going?

10:46.689 --> 10:48.865
- I'm transferring Ms. Jordan
to another hospital.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.609
- So this is Romero Willis,
who I presented at rounds.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.480
- Pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumor.

10:55.524 --> 10:56.917
Yeah, that's right.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.527
And if you concur,

10:58.570 --> 11:01.356
I plan on going in
with a chevron incision

11:01.399 --> 11:02.879
and resecting the pancreas,

11:02.923 --> 11:05.882
leaving margins
approximately here and here.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.884
- Do you see
this dark spot here, Veronica,

11:07.928 --> 11:09.320
on the wall of the stomach?

11:09.364 --> 11:11.714
The tumor is not confined
to the pancreas.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.063
If you start cutting,

11:13.107 --> 11:14.630
you're gonna be compelled
to keep cutting.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.588
You'll take out the stomach
and then half the liver,

11:16.632 --> 11:19.287
and you may even have to resect
the entire diaphragm.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.550
If you pull this thread,

11:21.593 --> 11:24.814
it will cost this hospital
$750,000

11:24.858 --> 11:29.732
with no guarantee this patient
can even survive post-op.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.779
- So basically,
what you're saying is,

11:32.822 --> 11:36.347
it's just too expensive
to save this man's life?

11:38.349 --> 11:41.483
No, I wanna hear you say it.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.615
- The answer is no,
Dr. Fuentes.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.705
The surgery is not approved.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.755
- All right, so tell me,
was it always like this?

11:52.799 --> 11:55.497
- No.
No, we used to be really close.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.501
Every summer, we'd go to
Oak Island, just the two of us.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.633
- The island with no roads,
no power?

12:01.677 --> 12:04.985
That is some intense, rugged
father-son bonding right there.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.116
Yes, sir.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.204
Anything you want
on Oak Island,

12:07.248 --> 12:08.640
you gotta build yourself.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.685
Mm.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.340
Nobody can build like my dad.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.994
I always looked up to him.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.517
Yeah.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.432
Okay, so tell me
about when it changed.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.785
- A few years
after the shooting,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.700
I'm home from college
for Thanksgiving,

12:24.744 --> 12:27.268
and I go to use
my dad's laptop,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.444
and I see that on his browser,

12:29.487 --> 12:33.578
he has this video about
how 9/11 was an inside job.

12:33.622 --> 12:34.841
I mean, I thought
it was "The Onion,"

12:34.884 --> 12:37.974
but then I see
he's got, like, 60 tabs open.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.543
Lots about Nick's Grocery,
about how it was a false flag.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.327
I mean, he's cooking
the turkey,

12:43.371 --> 12:44.807
and I'm looking
at a photo of my friend

12:44.851 --> 12:47.201
dying on the ground
with arrows pointed at him

12:47.244 --> 12:50.160
saying, "Blood isn't this red!

12:52.293 --> 12:53.642
Did you confront him?

12:53.685 --> 12:54.774
Yeah.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.866
But it's like
he was brainwashed.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.565
Like he wasn't
even my dad anymore.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.350
Hmm.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.266
- Shrinks can help people
get out of cults, right?

13:10.659 --> 13:14.445
Yes, but this isn't a cult,

13:14.489 --> 13:16.708
not like we've known.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.319
But, you know,
cults have one leader.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.451
They have a physical location
that you can actually leave.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.975
That's not the case here.

13:22.018 --> 13:25.369
This internet-fueled delusion
is still very new,

13:25.413 --> 13:27.850
but from what doctors
are seeing,

13:27.894 --> 13:30.374
cult deprogramming tactics
don't work.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.376
So what does?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.336
Nothing.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.689
- I mean, he's not just
some rando

13:40.732 --> 13:42.473
who clicked on the wrong
social media post

13:42.517 --> 13:43.735
about mass shootings.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.128
I'm his son.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.477
I was there.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.088
He picked me up,
and I was covered in blood.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.264
He knew it was real.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.831
He's still in there.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.966
Help me get my dad back,
please.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.973
- You've certainly been
in and out

14:04.017 --> 14:06.802
of some highly esteemed
institutions.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.064
Thank you.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.283
So I'll do you the favor

14:09.326 --> 14:10.893
of not bringing you
into this one.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.156
- Not...
What?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.854
Something stinks.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.988
The ex-medical director
begging to work here?

14:19.032 --> 14:21.469
I don't buy it.
You want something.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.471
So what's your game?

14:23.514 --> 14:25.342
Very good, Antonio.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.301
You got me, okay?
You're very astute.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.607
So they say.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.914
- I need your seat
on the New Amsterdam board.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.133
Mm.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.786
Very stirring.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.179
As you can see,
we're not exactly

14:36.223 --> 14:37.964
busting at the seams here.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.922
Sixth floor
isn't the best spot,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.142
as you might notice,
for an urgent care.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.578
Corporate doesn't seem to care,

14:43.621 --> 14:45.623
but I know it's gonna
land on me somehow.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.106
You find a way to triple
our patient volume,

14:50.150 --> 14:52.979
increase our revenues,
and that seat's yours.

14:53.022 --> 14:57.157
- You want me to triple
your pat--that's impossible.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.942
- They say anything's possible,
you want it badly enough.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.162
Okay.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.687
All right, you give me
hiring privileges, and...

15:05.730 --> 15:07.428
you got yourself a deal.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.734
- Welcome
to Urgent Medicine Inc.

15:16.219 --> 15:16.393
.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.178
- Hello.
- So there I was,

15:18.221 --> 15:19.614
<i>licking every inch</i>
<i>of your body.</i>

15:19.657 --> 15:21.572
- Mr. Twickham, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.661
- Oh, role-playing? Kinky.
I like it.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.315
So where were we?

15:25.359 --> 15:27.709
Oh, right,
the gazebo was a-rocking,

15:27.752 --> 15:29.929
<i>so don't come a-knocking.</i>

15:31.756 --> 15:33.497
Wrong number!

15:33.541 --> 15:34.934
Hello? Hello?

15:37.023 --> 15:40.983
Broken.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.988
Welcome.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.990
- Hey, you got a minute
for a consult?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.644
Yeah, always.

15:49.687 --> 15:52.864
- So I have a patient
who is losing his battle

15:52.908 --> 15:55.911
with late-stage bone cancer.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.174
His only wish is to live
long enough

15:58.218 --> 16:00.002
to attend
his daughter's wedding.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.439
It's only three months away,
but I don't think

16:02.483 --> 16:04.572
he's going to make it
that long.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.182
That's heartbreaking.

16:06.226 --> 16:10.447
- Well, I was hoping that you
might have a way to--

16:10.491 --> 16:13.102
you know, with--

16:13.146 --> 16:19.195
to extend his life
with the means and methods

16:19.239 --> 16:25.245
that maybe are outside of
the realms of scientific study.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.379
- You've come
to the right place.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.731
I was just putting together
this elixir.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.082
It's from the springs
of the Loxahatchee River

16:36.125 --> 16:38.258
where, in 1513,

16:38.301 --> 16:41.565
Ponce de León searched
for the Fountain of Youth.

16:41.609 --> 16:42.653
Oh.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.439
Wait, seriously?

16:45.482 --> 16:46.788
Of course not.

16:46.831 --> 16:50.052
This is Dijon vinaigrette
for my arugula salad.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.967
I am a medical practitioner.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.360
I don't make magic potions.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.231
I'm a healer. I'm like you.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.928
I can't just wave a magic wand

16:56.972 --> 16:58.974
and heal your patient,

16:59.018 --> 17:00.628
even though I wish I could.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.110
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.504
Enjoy your salad.

17:11.595 --> 17:15.860
- I have heard what Drew
has to say about that day.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.645
But what about you, Robert?

17:20.430 --> 17:22.606
- You think
it's gonna help him?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.478
I do.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.349
- Drew and I don't see
eye to eye on Nick's Grocery,

17:26.393 --> 17:29.265
and I don't wanna
keep upsetting him.

17:29.309 --> 17:32.442
- That day was hard
for everyone, okay?

17:32.486 --> 17:35.097
But I think what Drew
needs to hear

17:35.141 --> 17:39.145
is what it was like
for you in your words.

17:39.188 --> 17:42.104
I was at work.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.716
My wife called
and said she saw

17:45.760 --> 17:48.980
Drew's store on the news.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.592
Brought Drew home.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.335
- Okay, well, what was that
like, getting that call?

17:55.378 --> 17:58.512
- Bad news, your heart drops,
you know?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.035
I could hear panic
in her voice,

18:00.079 --> 18:01.993
but she was talking so fast.

18:02.037 --> 18:05.562
It took me a sec to get what
she was seeing on the news,

18:05.606 --> 18:07.042
but when I did...

18:08.870 --> 18:12.656
When I did...

18:12.700 --> 18:16.791
I did, like, 90
out of that parking lot.

18:16.834 --> 18:21.448
I had this image of you...

18:21.491 --> 18:24.712
shot,

18:24.755 --> 18:29.151
dying, wanting me with you
when you went...

18:29.195 --> 18:32.459
and not being with you.

18:32.502 --> 18:37.594
But then I come
around the corner...

18:37.638 --> 18:40.075
and there you are.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.425
My boy.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.297
Alive.

18:48.431 --> 18:52.000
- You both experienced
a trauma that day.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.654
It's not the fear

18:53.697 --> 18:57.179
or the pain that casts
a shadow over your life.

18:57.223 --> 19:01.314
It's the,
"Why did this happen? Why?"

19:01.357 --> 19:06.319
You ask God,
you ask the universe, and...

19:06.362 --> 19:10.714
you don't get
an answer, ever.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.151
And that is so hard.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.893
And in that void, we turn
to whatever we can find.

19:15.937 --> 19:20.071
We turn to anything that looks
like it might tell us why,

19:20.115 --> 19:22.465
no matter
how far-fetched it may be.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.644
But some things
can't be explained.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.212
Sometimes "why"

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
doesn't have an answer.

19:34.390 --> 19:38.089
- Hmm.
You're right.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.265
You're right.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.399
All I wanna know is,
how did they get to my son

19:43.443 --> 19:44.574
and get him
to say those things?

19:44.618 --> 19:46.663
- Jesus!
- If you would just let me,

19:46.707 --> 19:48.230
I could show you
how it was all rigged--

19:48.274 --> 19:50.276
I was there, Dad! You saw me!

19:50.319 --> 19:51.581
Why the hell
would I make that up?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.366
I'm not saying you're lying.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.019
- Maybe we can just--
we can take a step back here.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.326
- I can't believe I thought
this would actually work.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.503
Drew, hang on.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.598
Where's Teyarnie Jordan?

20:08.642 --> 20:10.470
- Dr. Fuentes had her
transferred up to the OR,

20:10.513 --> 20:13.081
like, 20 minutes ago.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.960
- What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.441
- This middle school teacher
needs our help

20:25.485 --> 20:27.443
to get back to work.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.489
- This surgery
was not approved.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.493
- Yet we're starting
with a chevron incision.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.798
Scalpel.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.539
- As chief of medicine,
I will make certain

20:36.583 --> 20:38.585
that anyone doing procedures
behind my back

20:38.628 --> 20:41.631
will never find work in
another health-care facility.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.067
Noted.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.721
Now, get out of my OR.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.683
Scalpel.

20:54.557 --> 20:58.648
Need a little more light
on the field, please.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.129
- Why wasn't I notified
of my own patient's surgery?

21:01.172 --> 21:04.654
- Need I remind you of our
last exchange, Dr. Reynolds?

21:04.698 --> 21:06.526
Retractor.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.180
You refused to run labs
and order scans

21:09.224 --> 21:10.486
that I deemed relevant.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.835
You tried to push through
a surgical procedure

21:11.879 --> 21:13.924
before it was even clear
that surgery

21:13.968 --> 21:15.274
was the best course of action.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.710
Lap pad.

21:16.753 --> 21:19.800
So I ran those labs myself,
and I really didn't feel

21:19.843 --> 21:22.324
compelled to include you
in that decision.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.630
But if you're gonna
stick around,

21:23.673 --> 21:25.719
I suggest you
make yourself useful.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.939
Scrub in.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.209
- It's called
Urgent Medicine Incorporated.

21:38.253 --> 21:41.212
And I know, it sounds like
a front for the Serbian mob,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.649
and honestly, it might be,

21:42.692 --> 21:44.215
but we're gonna turn
this place around, okay?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.870
And this job is gonna
be way more hours

21:46.914 --> 21:47.915
with a lot less money.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.092
- How do you think your pitch
is going so far?

21:51.135 --> 21:53.094
- What you're trying to do
sounds amazing, Max.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.878
- Right? And that's why
I'd love to have you on board.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.228
- I would love to,
but my hands are full.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.753
My patient load is crazy
now that I'm no longer a chair.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.626
- So you expect
the former chair of surgery

22:03.670 --> 22:05.193
at the largest public hospital
in the country to join you

22:05.236 --> 22:08.022
working part-time at some
rinky-dink walk-in clinic?

22:08.065 --> 22:10.546
- Well, no, Claude,
I never said, "Rinky-dink."

22:10.590 --> 22:12.679
- Gladys, please.
- It's just a case

22:12.722 --> 22:14.115
- of supply and demand.
- Uh-huh.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.899
- You know, there's
a nationwide nursing shortage.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.598
And my level of skills
is in very high demand.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.296
- Well, I can see that.
- I can even make my own hours.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.385
- That's great! Then you can
totally fit Urgent Medicine

22:23.429 --> 22:24.778
right into your schedule.

22:24.821 --> 22:27.694
- Oh, Max,
you couldn't afford me.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.480
Sandra Fall, me and you

22:31.524 --> 22:33.482
back together again
like Thelma and Louise!

22:33.526 --> 22:34.788
- They drove off a cliff.
- Oh, yeah.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.006
What about--excuse me--
Butch and Sundance?

22:36.050 --> 22:37.704
- Died in a hail of bullets
in Bolivia.

22:37.747 --> 22:40.141
- Oh. Well, how about
peanut butter and--

22:40.184 --> 22:41.403
Tall mocha latte for Tanya!

22:43.057 --> 22:45.668
Max, for over a year, I've been
trying not to work for you,

22:45.712 --> 22:46.713
and I've finally succeeded.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.629
- But--
- My answer is no.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.108
No.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.110
No.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.373
No.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.331
Hell no.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.204
How can you say that?

23:00.248 --> 23:01.467
How can everybody say that?

23:01.510 --> 23:02.685
We're talking
about New Amsterdam.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.992
There's no place
in the world like it.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.950
How can nobody
wanna fight for it?

23:06.994 --> 23:10.345
- 'Cause we all lost our jobs
'cause of you, Max.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.607
And now you want us
covering your six

23:11.651 --> 23:13.609
like you're some kind
of Joan of Arc?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.351
Listen, I'm sorry, Max,
all right,

23:16.395 --> 23:17.613
but you're just
gonna leave again.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.049
You're gonna leave
New Amsterdam in the hands

23:19.093 --> 23:20.616
of some other bureaucrat.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.270
You tell me
you're sticking around,

23:22.313 --> 23:23.837
you're not going
back to London,

23:23.880 --> 23:26.492
I'll come with you right now,
and so will everyone else.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.971
Can you do that?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.059
- I--

23:30.365 --> 23:32.367
Yeah. I didn't think so.

23:49.297 --> 23:49.471
.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.212
<i>- Dad, I so wish</i>
<i>you were here.</i>

23:51.255 --> 23:52.561
<i>Oh, the walk was amazing,</i>

23:52.605 --> 23:55.956
<i>but this view,</i>
<i>it's everything we imagined.</i>

23:55.999 --> 23:57.610
I can see that.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.404
- I know it's hard for people
trained in Western medicine

24:09.448 --> 24:11.493
to understand what I do.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.670
Look, I swear

24:14.714 --> 24:17.325
I was not trying
to ridicule your specialty.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.761
I know.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.023
You're struggling
with the limitations

24:20.067 --> 24:21.634
of your power
to care for this man,

24:21.677 --> 24:25.028
and you came to me for help,
and I whiffed it.

24:25.072 --> 24:28.162
I just know that I have used

24:28.205 --> 24:30.425
every single tool
in my toolbox.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.781
- I might have one left
in mine.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.658
- Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.094
I do. I do. I do.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.878
He's so lost in this,

24:48.922 --> 24:50.227
but his heart's still there.

24:50.271 --> 24:54.101
Yes. Yes, it is. It is.

24:54.144 --> 24:57.147
- So what do we do?
How do we help him change?

24:57.191 --> 24:59.889
He can't change.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.717
He won't.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.545
So you have to.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.375
But he's the one who's wrong.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.551
He's the one who believes
things that aren't true.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.944
Exactly.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.686
You are able to tell
what's real and what is not.

25:13.729 --> 25:14.948
The burden falls to you

25:14.991 --> 25:16.732
to do what he can't,
what he isn't doing.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.474
- No. No, no, he's just
lost contact with reality,

25:19.518 --> 25:21.911
and if we can figure out why,
then we can bring him back.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.086
We'll never know why.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.567
Even if we did,
it wouldn't matter.

25:25.611 --> 25:26.655
It wouldn't change anything

25:26.699 --> 25:28.048
because the reason
doesn't matter.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.571
Of course it matters.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.355
Conspiracy theories
aren't harmless.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.053
They're the reason why millions
of people won't get a vaccine

25:33.096 --> 25:34.620
that could save their lives.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.012
They're why global warming

25:36.056 --> 25:37.797
might actually kill
every person on the planet.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.146
Right.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.669
- Mass shootings like Nick's
happen so often,

25:40.713 --> 25:42.062
it isn't even news anymore,

25:42.105 --> 25:44.238
and I'm supposed to just
put my head in the sand?

25:46.501 --> 25:49.025
Yes.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.027
If you want a relationship
with your father,

25:51.071 --> 25:54.291
that is the price tag,
accepting his reality.

25:56.859 --> 25:59.079
- But how am I supposed
to have a relationship

25:59.122 --> 26:02.517
with somebody who insists
on calling me a liar?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.085
- He's not insisting on that,
is he?

26:05.128 --> 26:07.000
He didn't wanna
discuss the topic.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.436
He didn't share
his beliefs with you.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.264
The only reason you found out

26:10.307 --> 26:12.266
is because
you borrowed his laptop.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.790
The person who keeps insisting

26:14.834 --> 26:16.444
that you talk about this
is you.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.622
Because it happened...

26:20.666 --> 26:21.754
to me.

26:21.797 --> 26:25.105
Yes, it did happen.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.107
But now you have a choice.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.719
You can be right,
or you can have your father,

26:30.763 --> 26:31.938
but you can't have both.

26:37.421 --> 26:41.295
- And that is the last
of the primary tumor.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.775
Negative for hypothermia.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.909
- Yeah, Mr. Willis should get
a Medal of Honor.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.563
Sponge and lap pad.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.175
Can you imagine being
a middle school teacher?

26:52.219 --> 26:54.656
Ugh, brutal work.

26:57.746 --> 27:00.793
Janice, no stories from you?
You're usually so chatty.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.673
Dr. Palpa said
if we helped you,

27:11.717 --> 27:13.283
we'd all lose our jobs.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.985
Well, that is not happening.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.160
I will protect you.

27:20.203 --> 27:23.337
I will protect
every single one of you.

27:23.380 --> 27:27.471
Helping this man was my call,
and it is the right call.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.169
He needs us today,
and we're gonna do

27:29.212 --> 27:31.650
whatever it takes
to help him, understood?

27:33.521 --> 27:34.696
I got you.

27:38.482 --> 27:42.356
And that is the last
of the primary tumor.

27:42.399 --> 27:46.447
Moving on to expose
the stomach wall.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.578
Forceps.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.019
Damn it.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.020
What you got?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.282
Right there.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.724
I don't see anything.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.379
It's that tiny spot.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.208
Teyarnie's tumor has invaded
her stomach wall.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.212
Ooh. Okay.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.694
Close her up.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.782
Close her up?

28:16.825 --> 28:19.175
No, we just resect
the stomach wall.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.830
- That's just the beginning,
Dr. Reynolds.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.571
And then we'd have to perform
a radical resection,

28:23.614 --> 28:25.225
remove half of her liver
or more.

28:25.268 --> 28:26.574
Yeah, so we do it.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.532
To not do it
is a death sentence.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.970
Scalpel.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.842
- Dr. Reynolds, I want you
to think this through.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.715
If we keep resecting,
what awaits Teyarnie

28:36.758 --> 28:38.499
when she wakes up?

28:38.542 --> 28:41.241
She's gonna need a kidney
transplant, a liver transplant,

28:41.284 --> 28:43.896
an islet cell transplantation
of the pancreas.

28:43.939 --> 28:47.769
And if she survives, she'll
never drive a big rig again.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.337
Following down this path
is simply not worth it.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.122
This is her only chance!

28:53.166 --> 28:55.603
Dr. Reynolds, I said stop!

28:55.646 --> 28:56.735
You're done!

28:56.778 --> 28:58.345
I'm not done, actually.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.609
- Step away from the table,
and get out of my OR now!

29:01.652 --> 29:03.829
- This is not how we do things
around here!

29:15.014 --> 29:16.363
Get out.

29:23.936 --> 29:26.503
All right, let's get to it.
Let's close her up.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.881
Oh, sorry.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.752
I just came out
to clear my head, but I can--

29:57.796 --> 29:59.145
- No, no, just--
don't worry about it.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.929
I'm just leaving.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.153
- I did what I did
for the sake of the hospital.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.155
- How's that working out
for you?

30:09.198 --> 30:10.809
- Hey, man,
you're the one who left.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.071
Yeah, because I thought

30:12.114 --> 30:13.463
the people who stayed
would keep fighting.

30:13.507 --> 30:14.856
Yeah, but how long?

30:14.900 --> 30:17.380
Max, how long should we keep
risking our careers,

30:17.424 --> 30:19.078
our livelihood,
our reputations?

30:19.121 --> 30:20.644
For six months, a year?

30:20.688 --> 30:21.907
How long
should we keep fighting

30:21.950 --> 30:23.430
to make it easier for you?

30:23.473 --> 30:25.519
- Easier for--
you think this is easy?

30:25.562 --> 30:27.477
I'm dragging Luna
back and forth across an ocean.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.349
I'm leaving behind the life
I'm just getting started.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.351
So what?

30:31.394 --> 30:33.962
So we should be grateful
for your presence?

30:34.006 --> 30:36.747
We should be thankful
that you came back to save us?

30:39.011 --> 30:40.969
I just came back to help.

30:42.666 --> 30:45.191
And today, when I asked
all my friends to join me,

30:45.234 --> 30:47.410
they all said no.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.331
You didn't ask me.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.944
No. I didn't.

31:10.346 --> 31:10.564
.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.175
- This is why I didn't wanna
come here today.

31:13.219 --> 31:16.048
- Yes, today has been
very hard.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.180
But Drew and I have spoken,

31:18.224 --> 31:20.835
and he has something
he'd like to say to you.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.364
You remember Oak Island?

31:30.149 --> 31:33.326
Remember how nothing mattered
except the essentials?

31:33.369 --> 31:37.765
Pumping water, starting a fire,
getting the generator to work.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.900
- I didn't think you cared
about that place that much.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.423
I didn't.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.907
But it's the only place
I had you to myself.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.260
Like the rest of the world...

31:54.303 --> 31:56.566
didn't exist.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.832
Go on. Tell him.

32:05.749 --> 32:06.968
I've been, you know,

32:07.012 --> 32:10.711
thinking about making
a coffee table

32:10.754 --> 32:12.931
for the house.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.153
I just--

32:18.197 --> 32:20.939
I don't know
how to make a dovetail joint.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.162
Oh.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.382
Well...

32:29.425 --> 32:34.343
your wood
has to be planed true.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.606
Otherwise,
the cuts won't line up.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.004
Maybe you can show me.

32:46.747 --> 32:47.748
But if you don't have time--

32:47.791 --> 32:49.271
I'd be happy to.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.624
I'd be happy to.

32:54.668 --> 32:58.498
- All right, we could just
go back to the house

32:58.541 --> 33:01.022
and focus on the basics.

33:05.853 --> 33:09.639
Lewis, these are

33:09.683 --> 33:11.641
Tibetan singing bowls.

33:11.685 --> 33:14.296
They're used in traditional
Buddhist practices,

33:14.340 --> 33:17.256
and their sounds
are known to be very healing.

33:17.299 --> 33:20.259
- Well, at this point,
I'll try just about anything.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.914
Can you take
a deep breath for me?

33:27.701 --> 33:29.746
Good.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.009
And another.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.670
So far, better than chemo.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.330
I'm curious,

33:48.374 --> 33:50.506
where is your daughter
getting married?

33:50.550 --> 33:53.205
In the country,

33:53.248 --> 33:56.469
an old hotel in Connecticut.

33:56.512 --> 34:00.516
- You got your tux all ready?
- Oh, yeah.

34:02.562 --> 34:06.435
- I bet that it's beautiful
up there this time of year.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.395
Do you have a live band?

34:12.746 --> 34:14.313
- I, uh--

34:14.356 --> 34:16.445
Tell me about her dress.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.542
<i>Her dress?</i>

34:28.936 --> 34:30.633
<i>Yeah, the wedding dress.</i>

34:30.677 --> 34:32.766
<i>What's it look like?</i>

34:38.163 --> 34:41.079
<i>It's cream...</i>

34:41.122 --> 34:43.429
<i>long.</i>

34:43.472 --> 34:46.127
<i>Nothing fancy, but beautiful.</i>

34:50.131 --> 34:53.656
<i>- My little girl</i>
<i>is so, so beautiful.</i>

36:00.854 --> 36:02.464
Is he...

36:09.123 --> 36:12.866
- But you got him
to his daughter's wedding.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.139
<i>ER physician to three, stat.</i>

36:25.183 --> 36:27.446
<i>ER physician to three, stat.</i>

36:27.489 --> 36:29.361
We failed our patient today.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.365
I know.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.500
Dr. Fuentes,

36:38.544 --> 36:41.677
you are incredibly,
incredibly gifted...

36:41.721 --> 36:43.723
<i>- Dr. Reynolds,</i>
<i>you are easily</i>

36:43.766 --> 36:46.595
one of the best surgeons
I've ever seen.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.165
And I want you to know

36:51.209 --> 36:55.256
that I have stood exactly where
you're standing right now.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.650
- But I want you to ask
yourself a hard question.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.436
How can you do the most good
with those talents?

37:01.480 --> 37:03.873
Today you gave
a middle school teacher

37:03.917 --> 37:06.398
two, maybe three more years,

37:06.441 --> 37:08.008
but you took away those years
from a patient

37:08.051 --> 37:09.836
that we'll have to turn away
tomorrow.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.404
- That is what so few people
in our profession

37:12.447 --> 37:15.276
are willing to admit,
much less understand.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.322
That the greater good

37:17.365 --> 37:19.976
is simply too expensive.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.978
Sacrifices must always
be made.

37:22.022 --> 37:26.722
- Now, the doctors who do
understand these hard truths...

37:26.766 --> 37:30.160
they're the ones
who keep this system afloat.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.207
- They're the ones who become
great leaders, who become...

37:33.251 --> 37:36.079
Medical directors.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.516
<i>Dr. Fuentes, right now,</i>

37:37.559 --> 37:39.779
you've got two doors
in front of you.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.520
Behind that first door,

37:41.563 --> 37:43.435
you're just another cog
in the system.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.741
You're just another
nice guy, right?

37:45.785 --> 37:49.484
- And behind that second door
is the opportunity to fix...

37:49.528 --> 37:51.399
- The system,
to decide what resources

37:51.443 --> 37:53.575
are best spent where and to...

37:53.619 --> 37:55.360
- Heal as many people
as possible...

37:55.403 --> 37:57.275
With what you've got.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.712
- The choice...
- Is yours.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.910
Sydney Tsimbaris?

38:23.953 --> 38:25.390
Sandra Fall from billing.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.783
I'm as surprised as you are.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.004
- We're backed up, boss.
You mind pitching in?

38:34.747 --> 38:36.531
- Didn't think
you had it in you.

38:38.490 --> 38:41.536
- You still can't afford me,
but I'm here.

38:41.580 --> 38:45.497
- What--what happened?
What changed your minds?

38:45.540 --> 38:47.325
Reynolds called me.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.111
Me too.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.678
Me too.

38:52.721 --> 38:53.940
Me too.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.681
- I don't even know
how he got my number.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.728
He called me too.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.038
How can I help?

39:16.702 --> 39:18.268
Hello.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.835
Hey.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.185
Sorry to call so late.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.839
It's okay.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.494
I was just getting up...

39:26.538 --> 39:29.105
mm, in three hours.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.107
- Probably not a good time
to talk about all the things

39:31.151 --> 39:32.674
we did in that gazebo, huh?

39:32.718 --> 39:34.328
No.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.156
No, I don't think it is.

39:36.199 --> 39:39.159
Well, if we can't

39:39.202 --> 39:43.511
talk about old memories,
then...

39:43.555 --> 39:45.557
maybe we could make
some new ones.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.428
Hmm.

39:47.472 --> 39:51.127
I'd love to, but how?

39:51.171 --> 39:52.477
How when we're oceans apart?

39:52.520 --> 39:55.349
What new memories
are we gonna make?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.872
Well, close your eyes.

39:58.178 --> 40:00.572
Well, that will be easy.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.400
<i>Now...</i>

40:02.443 --> 40:05.011
imagine me next to you...

40:07.448 --> 40:11.409
My arms wrapping around you.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.149
<i>Can you feel that?</i>

40:13.193 --> 40:16.588
- Max.

40:16.631 --> 40:19.808
Just...

40:19.852 --> 40:21.375
just try.

40:27.599 --> 40:31.080
Can you feel me touching you?

40:31.124 --> 40:33.256
Yes.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.084
<i>'Cause I can feel you.</i>

40:35.128 --> 40:40.263
<i>My fingers just--</i>
<i>just graze your neck</i>

40:40.307 --> 40:42.135
and slide down your chest...

40:44.311 --> 40:46.835
<i>Your stomach.</i>

40:46.879 --> 40:50.970
I can feel the heat
coming off your skin.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.493
<i>And I can smell you.</i>

40:52.537 --> 40:55.670
<i>It's that mixture</i>
<i>of sun and jasmine.</i>

40:55.714 --> 40:57.759
Where are your hands now?

40:59.065 --> 41:00.458
Where do you want them?

41:02.111 --> 41:03.939
I think you know.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.376
- I'm kissing
every part of you.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.728
You try to kiss me back,
but I don't let you.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.688
This is all for you.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.474
Then what?

41:16.517 --> 41:18.563
<i>- I work my way</i>
<i>down your body,</i>

41:18.606 --> 41:23.524
stopping at each...little spot.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.961
<i>I take my time,</i>

41:26.005 --> 41:28.486
<i>and I don't stop</i>

41:28.529 --> 41:31.053
until our bodies

41:31.097 --> 41:32.533
find their rhythm...

41:35.057 --> 41:37.799
And it's like I'm there,

41:37.843 --> 41:41.411
<i>Like there's no space</i>
<i>between us,</i>

41:41.455 --> 41:42.891
<i>no ocean apart,</i>

41:42.935 --> 41:45.328
<i>just you and me,</i>

41:45.372 --> 41:50.159
<i>and we fit together.</i>

41:55.687 --> 41:57.427
- You still--you still there?

42:00.605 --> 42:02.650
What are you thinking?

42:07.481 --> 42:10.789
I'm thinking...

42:10.832 --> 42:13.618
hmm...

42:13.661 --> 42:15.358
<i>that we're gonna be just fine.</i>
