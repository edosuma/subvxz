00:14.639 --> 00:17.225
[Colleen] <i>Your physical training</i>
<i>is nearly complete.</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:20.603
<i>The final step</i>
<i>is controlling your emotions.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:21.771
[grunting]

00:22.772 --> 00:24.691
[Colleen] <i>Davos is your blind spot.</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:29.404
<i>And he has two fists where you had one.</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:35.577
<i>He knows you're coming</i>
<i>and that all it takes to end this fight...</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:37.996
<i>is landing one blow.</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:44.085
He thinks he has you at a disadvantage.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.212
Let him believe it.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.549
[Davos] With practice comes mastery.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.342
[all] With practice comes mastery!

00:51.426 --> 00:53.053
He'll make the first move.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.765
-[Davos] With mastery comes knowledge.
-[all] With mastery comes knowledge!

00:56.848 --> 00:58.975
[Colleen] Keep control. Keep centered.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.646
Let him wear himself out.

01:04.189 --> 01:07.233
-[Davos] With knowledge comes strength.
-[all] With knowledge comes strength!

01:09.402 --> 01:10.904
[Davos] <i>If someone stands against you,</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:16.701
strike them down as the falcon would,
without mercy or hesitation.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.122
Keep your eyes open. Read him.

01:22.874 --> 01:26.002
He's all ego and overconfidence.
Do not be the same.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.171
-Huh!
-[grunting]

01:28.254 --> 01:31.716
Be relentless.
Look for a weakness to exploit.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.634
[grunts]

01:39.057 --> 01:42.602
Strike to kill.
Follow each attack with another.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.650
That's enough for now.

01:52.695 --> 01:53.571
No.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.490
Rain down destruction.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.580
Let's go again.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.257
[theme music playing]

03:26.623 --> 03:28.750
[Colleen] Albert and his crew
are getting the word out.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.920
And Sam has volunteers
from Bayard doing the same.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.756
Sounds like you're going viral, sensei.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.885
You don't have to call me that
when we're not training.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.639
Your strength and agility
are almost back to normal.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.723
It's pretty amazing.

03:44.307 --> 03:48.102
Yeah, well...
this thing is state-of-the-art.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.564
It's not the brace. It's you.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.903
Learning to compensate
and adjust in such a short time.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.905
That's mostly down to you.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.867
We still need Misty
to get the cops on board,

04:02.951 --> 04:07.413
because without them,
we can't get the bowl or Davos.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.710
And as good as you've been looking,
the hardest part is yet to come.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.050
Your technique with that
doesn't feel like Hand.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.345
My grandfather taught me. Before Bakuto.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.266
When my mother died and my father
sent me to live with my grandparents.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.017
How long did you stay with him?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.147
That's his katana, right?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.149
Yeah.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.778
He was the one who taught me Bushido.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.032
He was always so serious about my training
and I never understood why.

04:44.033 --> 04:48.621
I'd ask him, and he would just...
throw me a riddle.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.043
"The frog trapped in the well
does not understand the sea."

04:54.794 --> 04:57.338
He used to send me out on these missions.

04:57.422 --> 05:04.387
"Find three songbirds, a perfect plum,
track a tanuki until it went to ground."

05:04.971 --> 05:06.222
Sounds like fun.

05:07.598 --> 05:11.561
More an object lesson.
To observe the world around me.

05:13.062 --> 05:17.275
"A warrior must always remember
what they're fighting for."

05:17.358 --> 05:18.526
Hmm.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.114
Only thing we fought for in K'un-Lun
was the power of the Iron Fist.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.075
And now?

05:28.077 --> 05:33.791
Everything. You, this city, Davos.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.294
Physically, you're ready.

05:36.377 --> 05:40.131
But facing Davos will be
just as emotional as it is physical.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.967
Davos is my blind spot.

05:44.469 --> 05:48.348
Everything that's happened between us,
it's... it's got my wires crossed.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.141
Then we'll uncross them.

05:50.224 --> 05:54.062
The challenge now
will be to think and choose,

05:54.645 --> 05:56.856
not just feel and react.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.692
[computer beeping]

05:59.776 --> 06:00.985
It's the tip line.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.909
Hello? You've seen something?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.663
On East Broadway and Clinton,
headed uptown. Thank you. We're on it.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.625
Car that matches Chen Wu's.
Could be Davos on the move.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.003
I have to warn whoever he's after.
That's Hatchet territory, right?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.463
Could be going after James Wong.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.174
Used to run numbers for the Hatchets
out of his apartment on Clinton.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.218
Get your stuff. You're coming with me.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.804
This is another test, isn't it?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.139
Call it field training.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.017
Time to remember what we're fighting for.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.320
Apartment 3B.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.989
I made some calls.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.283
We're about to reel in the big fish.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.413
If it's all the same,
I'd like to lend a hand with this one.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.164
Are you sure this is the place?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.084
Yeah. Trust me. 3B.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.422
You've helped me dispose of dozens
of your former enemies.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.259
But you betrayed an equal number
of your former allies.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.594
I will never trust you.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.975
[knocking at door]

07:19.397 --> 07:20.857
[Liu] You can't be here.

07:21.732 --> 07:25.027
Ms. Wing. Mr. Rand. This is unexpected.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.531
No time to explain. Davos is coming.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.869
God, no. He'll rip us to pieces.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.873
Coward. Grab a weapon.
Stand beside me. Let him come.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.499
You don't stand a chance.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.504
We're not here to fight him.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.423
-We're here to get you out.
-Back door.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.601
[crashing]

07:59.729 --> 08:02.482
Danny! Danny, this is the test.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.859
-[breathing heavily]
-[Colleen] Don't react.

08:05.401 --> 08:09.864
Show me you can think and choose.
Control your emotions.

08:10.907 --> 08:11.949
Danny.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.453
Right. Think and choose.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.546
[vessel shatters]

08:33.554 --> 08:36.265
-You got a car?
-Yeah. This way. This way.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.480
[Chen] Hey!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.364
Well, this is an embarrassment of riches.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.075
-Mr. Ho's man.
-Chen Wu.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.829
Get Mrs. Yang out of here.
I'll handle this.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.377
-Love the new look.
-Let's see if I can give you the same.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.295
[both grunting]

09:34.282 --> 09:35.950
Colleen! Jump in!

09:52.883 --> 09:55.636
-How did they know we were coming?
-Don't ask me. Who let 'em get away?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.013
[groans]

09:57.096 --> 09:59.724
If you're playing both ends
against the middle, I swear--

09:59.807 --> 10:03.936
Those two took my eye!
And you'd do worse if I crossed you.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.148
Then how? How?!

10:11.611 --> 10:12.612
That's my car.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.240
[Walker] God damn it.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.172
[Mary over recording] <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

11:13.255 --> 11:15.633
<i>Now, I know that you must be pretty angry.</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:18.678
<i>All that missed time.</i>

11:19.470 --> 11:20.471
<i>It's no accident.</i>

11:20.554 --> 11:22.973
<i>I have done everything I can</i>
<i>to keep you away.</i>

11:23.849 --> 11:28.187
<i>Pills to keep me calm,</i>
<i>an open faucet to mimic rain.</i>

11:29.355 --> 11:33.901
<i>I think I'm changing,</i>
<i>which means you must be, too. </i>

11:35.111 --> 11:38.698
<i>I heard about what you're planning</i>
<i>to do with our future, Walker, and...</i>

11:40.241 --> 11:43.661
<i>I had to say something.</i>
<i>So I hope you hear me.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:45.913
<i>Hear this.</i>

11:47.206 --> 11:52.253
<i>Your friend Joy came round, and she said</i>
<i>she wanted you to protect her,</i>

11:53.045 --> 11:56.716
<i>which made me remember all the times</i>
<i>that you have protected me.</i>

11:57.550 --> 12:01.178
<i>Back in Green Bay... In Sokovia. </i>

12:08.060 --> 12:10.980
<i>You got us out of that hole,</i>
<i>so thank you for that.</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:12.606
[rewinds] <i>In Sokovia...</i>

12:14.024 --> 12:15.693
-[Walker gasps]
-Easy, soldier.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.320
You're okay.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.281
You're safe now.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.783
Can you tell me your name?

12:24.535 --> 12:25.578
Walker.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.916
Sergeant First Class Mary Walker.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.711
We've been looking for you
for a long time. [whistles]

12:34.587 --> 12:35.629
How long?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.049
How did you find me?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.302
[soldier 1] A lot of chatter
from these coordinates.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.471
Someone lit it up. Was that you?

12:45.222 --> 12:46.223
No.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.730
What happened here?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.065
I don't know.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.779
They came to get me.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.448
I was in the hole.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.034
And I think...

13:06.327 --> 13:08.662
No, I know that they
were going to kill me.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.295
And then I don't know what happened.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.423
<i>You got us out of that hole, so thank you.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:21.467
<i>You got us out of that hole, so thank--</i>

13:28.265 --> 13:29.892
[Ryhno] With practice comes mastery. [all] With practice comes mastery!

13:32.102 --> 13:33.729
[Ryhno] With mastery comes knowledge.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.397
[all] With mastery comes knowledge!

13:35.773 --> 13:37.358
[Ryhno] With knowledge comes strength.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.068
[all] With knowledge comes strength!

13:39.819 --> 13:41.237
[all grunting]

13:44.532 --> 13:45.616
[Ryhno] Now switch.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.500
Switch sides. Ten sets on each side.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.717
[panting] What the--

14:03.801 --> 14:05.302
What the hell? Back off!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.847
[Crank] What? That's what
we came here for. To fight.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.516
That's bullshit. Why're we learning
to kick each other's asses?

14:10.599 --> 14:13.519
-With mastery comes strength.
-That's not how it goes, dumbass.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.065
Start over. Gimme ten sets.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.193
Nah. I gotta take a piss.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.135
[door opens]

14:48.012 --> 14:49.638
Where do you think you're going?

14:50.973 --> 14:51.807
Hmm?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.907
You think what's going on
in there is hard?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.534
Having Davos train you, care for you?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.787
Try ending up on his bad side.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.291
The surest way onto his list
is to leave here.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.543
Or have one of these.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.342
Why are you giving me the 411?
You're his lady, ain't you?

15:26.425 --> 15:30.638
[scoffs] That's both sexist
and simplistic. How quaint.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.514
Look, do what you want, all right?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.099
But if I were you,

15:34.183 --> 15:37.436
I would get back in there,
put a smile on my face,

15:37.519 --> 15:39.355
and get with the program.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.152
Davos is just so proud of all of you.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.528
Let's not ruin his day.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.406
Unless you're dead set on suicide.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.338
She's been here
since you dropped her off last night.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.426
And the others arrived a few hours later.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.261
[Colleen] Liu, I recognize.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.972
Are those guys Hatchet soldiers?

16:13.055 --> 16:16.058
Some. Those three are Tigers, though.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.185
Maybe they're
finally working through peace.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.145
Or another kind of war.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.357
Whatever this is,
Bayard can't be involved.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.566
We'll handle it.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.320
We need to talk.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.241
A familiar refrain.
Usually preceding disaster.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.370
The peace you wanted has been achieved.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.497
It's a pretty heavily armed
version of peace.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.457
All that was needed was a common enemy.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.668
You're planning to retaliate
against Davos.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.671
He'll slaughter you. All of you.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.381
Not if we slaughter him first.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.758
[Sherry] I'm grateful
you came when you did.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.552
And I know you've saved lives.

16:52.219 --> 16:55.556
But he killed my husband and many others--

16:55.639 --> 16:56.640
[Colleen] We have a plan.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.018
We're gonna make a move on Davos
as soon as we're ready.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.311
-And it will be soon.
-We're ready now.

17:01.395 --> 17:06.650
If you go in after Davos...
how many more people will be hurt?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.193
Killed?

17:08.277 --> 17:10.029
People are already being killed.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.822
Just hear us out, please.

17:13.157 --> 17:17.619
My husband had many faults,
but he always learned from his mistakes.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.791
In that way,
I'm trying to be more like him.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.093
[grunting]

17:53.572 --> 17:56.200
Joy? What are you doing?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.452
I was looking for you.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.830
Why did you come here, Joy?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.042
-I just told you.
-No, not here, this room.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.336
Here with me.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.052
Because I want to change.
I want to be a better person.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.516
But you were afraid of me.
And then you weren't.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.559
What changed your mind?

18:24.853 --> 18:27.356
[chuckles] Does it really matter?

18:27.439 --> 18:30.109
It matters greatly.
It's something I need to understand.

18:32.861 --> 18:36.031
Why would you trust me if you fear me?

18:37.199 --> 18:41.245
If you were afraid... why join me?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.669
Because you need me as much as I need you.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.881
Take a walk with me.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.689
He's always listening.

19:10.899 --> 19:14.027
This was a Rand purchase,
so I've seen the blueprints of this place.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.948
Over there, they were gonna wall off
a 500-square-foot lobby.

19:18.615 --> 19:22.327
Average apartment
was going to be 6,000 square feet.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.831
The lobby is a glorified powder room.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.711
You're wondering where I'm going
with this. Or what a powder room is.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.837
The former.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.508
The people who designed this place,
they knew something important.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.803
First impressions don't mean a thing.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.890
First time I met you, for example.
Beside the point.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.057
Get to yours.

19:45.517 --> 19:50.272
Look, at your core, you are a good man.
A noble one, even.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.983
You push yourself
harder than anyone I've ever met.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.110
So I can get past the lobby,

19:55.194 --> 19:57.988
because I know the apartment has a view

19:58.071 --> 20:00.616
that I will wake to every day
and feel glad to be alive.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.454
I accept the methods
because I understand the man.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.043
Have you seen these?

20:12.461 --> 20:15.714
A killer. That's how they see me.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.343
They don't understand that all of this

20:19.426 --> 20:22.554
is a necessary component
of what will be a great rebirth.

20:22.638 --> 20:27.184
Show them more. It's a sales thing.
The way you brand yourself.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.602
I don't understand.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.522
You want to make the city a better place,
but you're killing people.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.233
It's mixed messages.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.860
Be the change you wanna present,

20:36.944 --> 20:39.529
and the people of this city
will see you as you want them to.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.699
Show them how you will better their lives.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.577
Show them the man that I see.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.455
The man I respect.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.791
And all of this goes away.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.422
The city must be purged.

20:59.925 --> 21:04.054
But maybe the righteous should be given
a chance to see me as you do.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.142
I apologize for doubting you.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.405
[Walker] <i>I need you to help me</i>
<i>understand this, Dr. Edmonds.</i>

21:22.489 --> 21:24.574
I did not kill those men.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.493
I wanted to.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.745
After what they did to me,
they deserved it.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.581
They deserved worse.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.876
But I didn't do it.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.965
And in the video, my alter, she thanks me
for getting her out of there.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.093
But I had nothing to do with it.

21:43.176 --> 21:47.514
A video left by your alter
troubled you enough to seek me out.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.309
Is this a common occurrence?

21:50.600 --> 21:51.893
[mutters]

21:52.602 --> 21:54.771
You know, sometimes I send her messages.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.274
This is the first time
she's ever reached out to me.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.278
Has something changed
in your environment to spark this?

22:01.361 --> 22:05.699
That's not the issue.
I need to find out what happened.

22:05.782 --> 22:09.745
Because neither you or your alter
remember escaping captivity.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.544
This special ops mission.
There were eight in your patrol.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.755
Is it possible that one of them
was also held,

22:19.838 --> 22:22.799
and ultimately escaped and freed you?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.886
Four of them died in the ambush,

22:25.969 --> 22:28.513
and the other three
over the next year or so.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.893
They made sure to show me the corpses.
What was left of them.

22:34.519 --> 22:38.482
These Sokovians... they like knives.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.153
So, no, it's not possible.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.499
Is Mary the only other alter
you're aware of?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.543
There's no one else.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.880
You say that as if you're absolutely sure.

23:04.758 --> 23:09.304
The soldiers that found you...
There must be a report of the incident.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.891
-A military record, redacted.
-Mmm.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.644
From the way you describe your alter,

23:15.727 --> 23:17.854
it doesn't seem as though
she's capable of violence.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.648
She's not.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.236
I'd always assumed that she convinced
someone to help get her out of there,

23:24.319 --> 23:26.321
and they had killed all those people.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.448
But in the video she thanked me.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.078
This happened years ago.
Why is it so present?

23:33.995 --> 23:38.917
What about this... missing time
troubles you now?

23:41.086 --> 23:44.339
I, uh... I have a place I could go.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.425
Somewhere safe.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.388
Where I could live some version of a life.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.768
But I need to understand the variables.

23:58.770 --> 24:03.358
With DID, the variables are many
and the answers few. One option is treatment,
a path towards integration.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.367
That process could bring some clarity.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.536
How long would that take?

24:15.287 --> 24:19.166
Well, hard to say it would work at all.
DID is full of question marks. We would start with at least six months
of in-patient treatment.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.504
Thank you for your time.

24:24.588 --> 24:29.301
If there's a possibility your alter
is capable of that level of violence,

24:29.384 --> 24:30.677
maybe you should stay. For your own safety.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.517
For your own safety...

24:38.560 --> 24:41.438
maybe you should forget
that I was ever here.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.947
Can I help you?

24:53.241 --> 24:55.494
I need something that says,

24:55.577 --> 24:57.746
"Sorry I'm the asshole
that got you knocked up

24:57.829 --> 25:00.665
and then fell off the wagon
in front of you."

25:01.958 --> 25:03.126
What do you recommend?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.671
-[exhales] Um...
-[Ward] You choose.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.759
[cell phone vibrating]

25:18.850 --> 25:21.061
[sighs] I'm somewhat occupied
at the moment.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.938
I need you to do something for me.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.149
-<i>The hell does that mean?</i>
-I don't have time for questions.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.528
You told me to leave you alone.
Repeatedly.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
<i>Yes, I did. And now I need this.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:35.408
Look. You know the factory in Jersey
you tried to buy for me?

25:35.492 --> 25:36.701
Doesn't ring a bell.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.412
Don't be a shit, Ward.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.040
<i>Yes, obviously I remember the factory.</i>

25:42.123 --> 25:45.252
Good. I need you to take it over for me.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.505
[scoffs] I warned you
against over-leveraging.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.048
<i>Now that you've seen the light,</i>

25:50.131 --> 25:52.634
<i>I have to pick up the tab</i>
<i>on some poison pill?</i>

25:52.717 --> 25:56.888
It's not a poison pill.
The Sofia Rios deal is solid. I just...

25:58.557 --> 26:00.267
There are other matters
taking my attention.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.476
<i>So I'm moving on.</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:03.562
What does that mean?

26:03.645 --> 26:05.855
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to explain it all right now, okay?</i>

26:07.315 --> 26:08.525
What's up with you, Joy?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.945
<i>This has to do with the whole Davos thing?</i>

26:13.321 --> 26:16.533
Just do it, Ward.
I thought you wanted to mend fences.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.784
I did.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.453
You said you didn't.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.082
Just forget it.
All right, I'll ask someone else.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.375
No, I'll do it.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.295
I just truly don't understand.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.421
You don't need to.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.465
The deed and the project charter
are in the credenza.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.176
Spare keys are with the super.
I'll text you the alarm code.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.061
It's $45.50.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.902
You can keep it.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.655
Good luck. Yeah.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.745
My luck doesn't break that way.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.043
Oh...

27:09.878 --> 27:12.881
Mrs. Yang can't just box us out.
We saved her ass last night.

27:14.215 --> 27:17.177
They're gonna end Davos or die trying.
Probably both.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.138
I am over watching people
march to face their death

27:20.221 --> 27:21.514
like it's a badge of honor.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.266
It never ends.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.853
[sighs] Look, Colleen, come here.

27:26.936 --> 27:27.937
[Colleen sighs]

27:28.396 --> 27:30.690
You're right.
We have a plan, and we're close.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.903
Let's just get what we need
and get to Davos before they do.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.489
-Colleen--
-And last night was impressive.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.866
You... You kept your emotional distance.

27:39.949 --> 27:40.950
Yeah.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.496
That's what we need to talk about.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.749
I wanted you to train me.

27:47.832 --> 27:51.920
But it feels like we're being forced to
choose between ending Davos' threat, or...

27:53.963 --> 27:55.298
or ending us.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.384
Are they mutually exclusive?

27:59.844 --> 28:00.845
I don't know.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.518
-[sighs]
-But I know that I didn't want this.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.186
Any of this.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.232
And I'm fighting for what I believe in,
no matter the cost.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.944
This is another lesson, isn't it?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.240
Think and choose. [exhales]

28:23.034 --> 28:24.411
So, what do we do now?

28:26.287 --> 28:29.666
When Mrs. Yang said she was gonna
mount an attack and kill your brother,

28:29.749 --> 28:30.875
what was your first reaction?

28:30.959 --> 28:32.961
Stop her by whatever means necessary.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.754
Punch your way out of the problem. Okay.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.673
And last night,
when Davos was right there,

28:36.756 --> 28:38.007
what did you wanna do?

28:38.091 --> 28:42.303
Stop him. Save him from crossing deeper
until he was too far gone.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.596
Okay, but you didn't.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.141
I've seen what happens
when I go with my instincts.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.310
I wanna do this the right way.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.690
You've crossed the Rubicon, Danny.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.567
The training worked.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.652
One last test.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.113
I need to see all this in action.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.159
So, what,
we just wait for Davos to make a move?

29:04.826 --> 29:08.538
Well, you remember those cage fights
I used to go to...

29:09.372 --> 29:11.624
when I was working through my anger?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.170
That's where I'm gonna take you.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.597
[Walker] You're not supposed to be here.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.099
Me?

29:30.810 --> 29:31.936
What is this?

29:33.146 --> 29:34.981
-A setup?
-No.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.692
Where'd you get the keys to this place?

29:37.776 --> 29:41.237
I'm asking the questions here.
You're in my sister's apartment.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.947
I was looking for her.

29:43.907 --> 29:44.991
What happened to you?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.160
[exhales]

29:48.036 --> 29:49.579
I tried to punch someone.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.499
Joy's not here. Thanks for playing.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.294
I was gonna ask her a favor.
But, actually, you'll do.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.547
I'm gonna say this differently.
Time to go.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.509
You and Joy have access
to the same Rand database,

30:02.592 --> 30:05.845
which is how you pulled the file on me
for Danny and the cop, yes?

30:07.096 --> 30:11.434
What I do and how I do it
are none of your business.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.102
Do you want me to call the police?

30:13.645 --> 30:15.647
Do you want your teeth
ripped out of your mouth?

30:17.065 --> 30:22.153
No. I don't.
No one wants their teeth pulled out.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.031
There's a part in my military history
that's been redacted.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.741
I need to find out what's under the black.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.785
[Ward] Mmm.

30:28.868 --> 30:35.458
Even if I wanted to help you, and I don't,
I can't pull non-redacted DOJ files.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.752
[Walker] You can't,
but you can pay someone who can.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.754
[Ward] Can't do it today.

30:41.589 --> 30:46.386
Agreed to do Joy a favor,
so my card is already punched.

30:47.136 --> 30:50.557
-Joy asked you for help?
-Up is down. Left is right.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.852
[Walker] That's exactly
why I need this file.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.614
[softly] Shit.

31:22.505 --> 31:26.134
I can get you your file,
but I'm gonna need something in trade.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.760
You just said you couldn't.

31:28.469 --> 31:29.596
Do you want it or not?

31:32.223 --> 31:36.185
Joy is with Davos.
She's worried she might not get out.

31:36.769 --> 31:37.687
She told you that?

31:37.770 --> 31:42.108
No. But I think I understand
why she asked me to do this for her now.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.862
Our mother, before she died, ran an NGO.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.573
Renewable energy
for third-world countries.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.992
Joy's business venture
is about solar cells. -What does that have to do with Davos?
-Nothing.

31:53.953 --> 31:58.082
But Joy knows that I'd be the best bet
to keep the project alive if...

31:58.166 --> 32:00.251
She doesn't come out of there alive.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.589
If I get you your file,
will you help me get to her?

32:05.465 --> 32:08.051
Get her away from him
if that's what needs to happen?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.928
Make sure she's safe?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.723
She is not safe
as long as he is breathing.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.391
I've told her as much.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.312
The only answer, when it comes to Davos,
is a final one.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.481
Then we bury a bullet in his brain.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.321
[Davos] Gather your things. We're leaving.

32:28.404 --> 32:29.781
[Chen] We're bringing them with us?

32:30.531 --> 32:32.575
Where are we taking them?
Some kind of field trip?

32:32.659 --> 32:36.079
I am bringing them with me.
You're arranging transportation.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.748
Heard Shifu. Get ready to go.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.334
[BB] Hey, man, I'm not feeling well.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.878
You don't wanna be
on the wrong side of this.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.089
I'm telling you, man.
I ate something weird.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.715
My stomach doesn't feel right.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.885
I can't go.

32:52.178 --> 32:55.390
-[BB grunts and coughs]
-[Ryhno] I'mma deal with you later.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.766
Bring him to the dark room.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.601
Hurry up! Come on.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.166
[metal clanking]

33:24.627 --> 33:27.338
-You want outta here?
-[BB] What do you think?

33:28.589 --> 33:31.426
You know what they'll do to you
if they find you're gone, right?

33:31.509 --> 33:33.386
I don't plan on sticking around
to find out.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.557
All right, I'll let you out.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.267
But I need your help.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.769
There's something I have to find.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.605
It's a very old bowl made of copper.
Have you seen it?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.150
A bowl? Lady...

33:47.233 --> 33:51.320
It can take his power away.
We don't have long to find it.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.324
Are you gonna help me
or should I lock you back in here?

34:05.918 --> 34:08.004
I want you to go right home. No detours.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.924
-[Davos] Your name is Henry Yip?
-That's right.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.722
I'll pay if you want. Tigers are gone.

34:17.805 --> 34:18.931
I don't want your money.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.143
You're the one
that has been killing the Triads.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.227
I am.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.521
Go inside. Now.

34:31.736 --> 34:35.448
We're ashamed of the way
we treated you and your staff.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.241
Please accept our apology.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.202
Good.

34:42.747 --> 34:45.374
I will be providing protection
from this day forward.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.043
There will be no charge.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.254
All that I ask in return...

34:51.881 --> 34:53.424
is be a good man.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.636
Seek justice. Reject corruption.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.518
Do you have a problem?

35:03.601 --> 35:04.769
No, I just...

35:06.270 --> 35:08.564
want to stay out of all of this.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.483
I've learned from my mistakes.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.777
You don't believe I'm a good man?

35:12.860 --> 35:16.280
No, I do. It's just...
I don't want to take sides.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.163
You're still in league
with the Golden Tigers.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.248
No, I never was.

35:25.331 --> 35:28.626
You reject my offer
to cling to your old ways.

35:29.293 --> 35:32.338
Support criminals instead of justice.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.635
I've never been part of any Tigers or--

35:39.011 --> 35:40.680
[groaning]

35:50.940 --> 35:54.485
He was part of the cancer
that's rotting this city.

35:55.528 --> 36:00.324
Nah. He was telling the truth.
He's not a Tiger, never was.

36:01.742 --> 36:05.329
We're out. BB was right. This...
This is some messed-up--

36:18.342 --> 36:20.553
We must end the battle
before it has begun.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.182
Strike like a falcon does.
Without mercy...

36:24.765 --> 36:25.892
Or hesitation.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.853
-Yeah?
-[Crank] Mmm-hmm.

36:34.066 --> 36:37.320
Is there anyone else who doubts the change
we're working to bring here?

36:37.737 --> 36:39.030
[all] No, Shifu.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.865
-[Davos screams]
-No, Shifu!

36:42.575 --> 36:43.576
Good.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.169
-[Danny] We early?
-[Colleen] Try late.

36:54.086 --> 36:57.215
They shut this place down
about six months ago.

36:58.382 --> 37:03.221
-[Danny] Why did you bring me here?
-[Colleen] To fight.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.017
Oh, come on, Colleen.
I'm not gonna fight you.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.520
Don't question me.
You're getting ready to face Davos.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.148
A few rounds with a bruiser
won't prep you for that.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.942
He knows how to push your buttons.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.527
So do I.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.738
I don't wanna hurt you.

37:20.821 --> 37:24.283
That's good. You don't want
to hurt Davos either, right?

37:26.160 --> 37:29.121
Kumite, a point match.
You grab a ribbon, you score a point.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.540
Opponent steps out of bounds,
you score a point.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.918
-First one to three wins.
-And if I win?

37:35.461 --> 37:36.879
I'll know you're ready.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.258
I'll know you can control your emotions
when you face him.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.974
-Are you sure it's even in here?
-It has to be. He'd keep it close.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.771
Hey, look. Under here.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.030
-Oh. Look.
-All right. Let me see it.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.705
[door opens]

38:10.788 --> 38:12.540
[whispers] Oh, shit. They're back.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.666
I'll slow them.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.960
This is our window.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.420
If the bowl is in there,

38:17.503 --> 38:19.338
you take it to the Chikara Dojo
on Monroe.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.589
Yeah, I know. Colleen's spot.

38:20.673 --> 38:24.260
Yes. You tell her
Danny will know what to do with it.

38:25.219 --> 38:29.432
I'll cover for you as long as I can.
Just make it look like we weren't here.

38:37.898 --> 38:38.983
[Joy] How'd it go?

38:39.817 --> 38:42.570
I should never have listened to you.
You misled me.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.114
What do you mean? Hey.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.574
Um...

38:51.704 --> 38:54.540
Hey. I'm a part of this, aren't I?

38:54.623 --> 38:56.876
Don't shut me out.
What do you think I did?

39:06.886 --> 39:08.763
It may not be purposeful, Joy...

39:10.431 --> 39:14.977
but you think you can solve a problem
with the careful application of lies,

39:15.061 --> 39:16.812
half-truths and handshakes.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.399
I've realized that there is only one way

39:20.483 --> 39:22.651
to solve the problems
that plague this city.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.946
So, what? You're just done?

39:35.956 --> 39:38.042
You don't care
if people hear your message?

39:38.125 --> 39:40.836
You presuppose that there are
more than deaf ears to hear it.

39:41.545 --> 39:45.299
Like unruly children,
I must bring this city to heel.

39:46.592 --> 39:50.805
See, there's a reason why, Joy,
they beat us in K'un-Lun.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.600
To break us down and make us submit.

39:54.683 --> 39:57.311
And it was then that we could
see the truth, accept the lesson,

39:57.395 --> 39:59.021
not-- not just in our minds...

40:00.439 --> 40:01.899
but in our blood.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.119
You're not half as clever
as you think you are.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.955
I'm sorry? [chuckles]

40:16.664 --> 40:18.833
Said the scorpion to the snake.

40:20.042 --> 40:21.043
It's a parable.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.211
Huh.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.173
Well, tell it at a party
and make some friends. Hmm?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.717
I'm nothing like you.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.553
Sure you are.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.431
A survivor.

40:34.181 --> 40:38.144
I survived him.
And I'll survive what comes next.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.397
So if you try to muscle me out...

41:08.007 --> 41:10.342
Three points. That's all you need.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.304
[grunting]

41:22.605 --> 41:23.898
Contact, huh?

41:35.784 --> 41:38.245
[exhales] Point for me. One-zero.

41:54.637 --> 41:55.888
Two-zero.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.349
[panting] Do not react.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.726
Think.

42:01.685 --> 42:02.770
Choose.

42:03.437 --> 42:07.191
That would be nice.
Maybe flashcards would help you remember.

42:08.317 --> 42:11.570
You think Davos loses his cool
when he uses the Fist?

42:12.404 --> 42:15.950
The one he took from you,
that he's using to clean up Chinatown

42:17.284 --> 42:21.080
I know what you're trying to do,
but I passed all your tests.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.500
I'm taking the Fist back.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.295
[shouts]

42:29.964 --> 42:34.510
Do what with it? Cause more chaos?
Break up more parleys?

42:34.593 --> 42:36.053
The Fist almost consumed you.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.556
Imagine what it's doing to him.
How it's changing him.

42:44.270 --> 42:48.107
And all of this could've been prevented
if you'd just kept your balance.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.870
Nice. [exhales] Two-one.

43:03.831 --> 43:07.376
But the way you got there,
that's what we need to get you past.

43:08.419 --> 43:12.214
You put yourself and everyone else
in danger when you react to your emotions.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.383
How am I to control my emotions
when you're in my face?

43:14.466 --> 43:17.219
That's the point. It's why we're here. [panting] You love Davos. You love me.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.604
I'm asking you to separate yourself
from that and show me you can fight.

43:41.702 --> 43:42.703
Two-two.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.666
You're frustrated, angry.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.294
I get it.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.923
I used to come here and fight
until I couldn't see straight.

43:55.883 --> 43:56.925
So what changed?

43:59.053 --> 44:01.263
I remembered what I was fighting for.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.351
What are you fighting for?

45:19.383 --> 45:21.260
[Colleen] I pushed too hard too fast.

45:22.177 --> 45:23.721
[Danny] No, it's not that.

45:24.638 --> 45:26.181
Something just clicked.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.476
Growing up, I had everything.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.981
Money, love, a future.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.737
When it got ripped away from me, I...
I didn't know how to process it.

45:41.029 --> 45:45.576
I reacted. I found a mission.
Become the Iron Fist.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.620
Mission kept you alive, Danny.

45:49.621 --> 45:50.622
It did.

45:52.791 --> 45:56.295
But at some point, I was just repeating
the cycle that K'un-Lun taught me.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.341
You asked me to remember
what I was fighting for.

46:03.385 --> 46:04.636
Truth is...

46:05.763 --> 46:09.850
it isn't Matt Murdock's mission,
or our neighborhood.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.603
It isn't Davos.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.355
It's not even you, Colleen.

46:19.193 --> 46:22.237
All I've been fighting for
is the power of the Iron Fist.

46:23.405 --> 46:27.534
The heart of the dragon.
I can feel it calling me.

46:28.827 --> 46:29.828
And because of that,

46:29.912 --> 46:33.081
it will always make me a danger
to the people I care about the most.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.503
Physically, I'm ready to face Davos.

46:38.545 --> 46:39.838
We can stop him.

46:41.924 --> 46:44.510
But when he's subdued
and we perform the ceremony...

46:46.845 --> 46:48.889
I can't take the power back.

46:52.434 --> 46:56.772
If we take the power out of Davos...
it has to go somewhere.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.233
Someone has to hold the Fist.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.151
I know.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.280
I think it should be you.
