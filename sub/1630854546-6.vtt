-Oh. Bit of chain, mate.

09:04.953 --> 09:07.528
This could be the missing link.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.215
That's what that is, mate.
A bit of chain.

09:10.442 --> 09:13.218
D-do you know your
date ranges for chains at all?

09:13.369 --> 09:17.964
I know that the older chains
have got an oval link.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.874
And these have got oval links.

09:19.968 --> 09:23.228
It looks like it's hand forged.

09:23.379 --> 09:26.898
So, what-what would
a chain that thin be used for?

09:27.050 --> 09:29.234
Well, if you've got
a chest or a box,

09:29.461 --> 09:32.386
Like a strongbox,
they used to put chains

09:32.480 --> 09:35.982
About this size around there
to secure and then they'd lock.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.559
-Just to keep it closed.
-Yeah.

09:38.653 --> 09:41.821
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Could gary be correct</i>
<i> that this chain link</i>

09:41.973 --> 09:43.323
<i> Might not only be ancient,</i>

09:43.475 --> 09:47.401
<i> But was also designed</i>
<i>to secure a strongbox or chest?</i>

09:47.495 --> 09:51.089

Hauling treasure.

All right, mate,

11:19.404 --> 11:21.680
The front and the back,
both sides.

11:21.907 --> 11:25.166
Then you can tell
by, like, that blue-green look

11:25.260 --> 11:26.409
That it's got copper in it.

11:26.428 --> 11:27.260
Gary:
Yeah.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.262
That looks really old.

11:29.915 --> 11:32.691
It looks like
an highly decorative piece.

11:32.842 --> 11:37.511
It could be a large brooch.
Could be a belt plate.

11:37.605 --> 11:40.606
Could be
an headdress decoration.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.775
It-it's got to be down in
the ground for like a couple

11:42.869 --> 11:45.428
Hundred years, I'd think,
to get a patina like that on it.

11:45.447 --> 11:47.205
No, a lot longer than that,
believe me.

11:47.356 --> 11:48.614
A lot longer? Wow.

11:48.767 --> 11:52.544
I've found roman coins
that come up looking like this.

11:52.771 --> 11:58.291
And I'm hoping that this
is the same date range

My first thought when-when
I saw it was that it's military.

But why is it here?
It shouldn't be on lot 8.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.627
And neither should've that
brooch, which was recovered

15:04.646 --> 15:06.220
Not far away from this.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.480
Yeah.

<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> In order to confirm the metal</i>
<i> composition of the artifact,</i>

15:23.831 --> 15:26.907
<i> Emma is now using</i>
<i> the x-ray fluorescence device,</i>

15:26.927 --> 15:31.095

Whoa.

15:34.826 --> 15:38.585
You'll see the copper
alloy's way up there.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.830
Emma:
That's 95% copper.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.665
So, if you look
at the iron component,

15:42.758 --> 15:46.427
It's almost as equal
as the zinc.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.173
And it is pretty small levels.

15:50.508 --> 15:51.449

<i> Laird:</i>

This hole, f.25-14.4,

That placement we feel
is going to hit that tunnel

20:36.143 --> 20:37.626

20:37.645 --> 20:38.885
Yeah, and-and potentially

20:38.980 --> 20:41.313
-There is more than
one tunnel here.
-Right.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.966
Paul:
The other thing, too,
is to try to delineate

20:44.059 --> 20:45.910
Whether it continues
up north to south

20:46.137 --> 20:48.729
In this direction,

20:48.823 --> 20:49.989

Yep.

21:26.027 --> 21:28.177
Has it been folded?

21:28.270 --> 21:31.697
Yes, it's been folded
three times.

21:32.517 --> 21:34.867
Laird:
So you can actually
see the fold there,

21:34.961 --> 21:37.586
See the overlaying fold.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.874
Rick:
So, these raised areas
you see

21:42.026 --> 21:42.949
And the recessed areas,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.860
That's not because
of the folding?

21:44.953 --> 21:45.952
-No.

Here's the other side, too.

22:03.564 --> 22:04.713
And it's fragile.

22:04.732 --> 22:07.716
It's been in the ground
for a long time.

22:08.069 --> 22:10.553
I want to go through
each little design.

22:10.571 --> 22:13.980
If I measure them out
and if they're not consistent,

22:14.075 --> 22:15.982
Then you know it's not stamped,

22:16.077 --> 22:18.336
It was handcrafted.

22:18.487 --> 22:22.989
Laird:
The implication is that is if
it's handcrafted, it's older.

22:23.084 --> 22:24.658
Rick:
We have to find a way

22:24.752 --> 22:26.418
To put a date to it

22:26.571 --> 22:29.663
-Because it-it's such

something more ceremonial.

23:15.119 --> 23:17.136
It's, um, very thin.

23:17.288 --> 23:19.304
It appears quite decorative.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.791
I've never seen anything
quite like that before, so...

23:23.294 --> 23:25.385
This is definitely
an intentional decoration.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.964
There's no way
this can be modern?

23:29.057 --> 23:30.649
Not to me.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.742
And helen?

23:31.969 --> 23:33.986

23:49.003 --> 23:50.243
<i> We're gonna look into it.</i>

23:50.337 --> 23:52.838

Within that symbology.

23:54.008 --> 23:55.007
Mm-hmm.

23:55.159 --> 23:56.082

to follow this.

-But we may have hit
another tunnel.

confidence at about 103 feet

26:46.272 --> 26:48.939
Was the floor of this tunnel.

26:49.091 --> 26:50.182
So-- which is-is higher,

26:52.353 --> 26:53.277
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> Is it possible</i>

26:53.428 --> 26:56.596
That this tunnel,
at this elevation,

26:56.616 --> 26:59.858
Would have allowed another
tunnel to come very near it?

26:59.952 --> 27:03.603
<i> Might one or both of</i>
<i> these tunnels be associated</i>

27:03.623 --> 27:06.031
<i> With original work</i>
<i> in the garden shaft?</i>

27:06.125 --> 27:08.033
<i> It's possible.</i>

27:08.535 --> 27:09.701
Yeah, you could still
project a line

where we have our tunnel.

27:11.705 --> 27:14.039

go right through.

So, that makes our life
a little bit more confusing

27:17.862 --> 27:19.285

a little bit more work,

28:14.676 --> 28:15.767
Steve:
And that's where we've left off.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.695
Up until this point,
we're pretty confident

28:17.846 --> 28:20.772
That this is our tunnel that
we've been chasing northwest

28:20.866 --> 28:23.425
To the garden shaft,
based on the drill program

28:23.444 --> 28:27.020
And sonar work,
up to this green circle.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.189
Now, we're into
a bit of a problem.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.116
You see this big green circle?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.100
Rick:
Yep.

28:32.119 --> 28:33.435
Steve:
That's our muon setback.

28:33.454 --> 28:37.606
And you see this red line?
That's our muon power.

28:37.624 --> 28:40.050
So, those are two obstacles
we have in our way.

28:40.627 --> 28:42.702
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Late last fall,</i>

28:42.722 --> 28:46.448
<i> The oak island team installed</i>
<i> muon tomography sensors</i>

28:46.467 --> 28:49.284
<i> Deep underground</i>
<i> in five boreholes</i>

28:49.303 --> 28:51.211
<i> Across the money pit area.</i>

28:51.230 --> 28:52.637
<i> These devices are detecting</i>

28:52.790 --> 28:55.715
<i> Subatomic particles</i>
<i>that originate from outer space</i>

28:55.735 --> 28:58.569
<i> As they penetrate</i>
<i> the earth's surface.</i>

28:58.796 --> 29:00.812
<i> The collected data</i>
<i> will be used to generate</i>

29:00.965 --> 29:03.741
<i> A detailed map of</i>
<i> underground anomalies</i>

29:03.968 --> 29:07.486
<i> Including tunnels, voids</i>
<i> and large objects</i>

29:07.638 --> 29:09.395
<i> Such as a treasure vault.</i>

29:09.415 --> 29:12.398
We kind of find ourselves
in a bit of a,

29:12.493 --> 29:14.159
You know, boxed-in effect.

29:14.311 --> 29:18.422
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> However, this potential</i>
<i> breakthrough operation,</i>

29:18.649 --> 29:20.983
<i> Which will take several</i>
<i> more months to complete,</i>

29:21.001 --> 29:24.911
<i>Presents an unfortunate obstacle</i>
<i>for the team's drilling program.</i>

29:24.930 --> 29:28.766
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> The muon detectors are</i>
<i> collecting data as we speak.</i>

29:28.993 --> 29:32.919
<i> They cannot be moved</i>
<i> and you need to</i>

29:32.938 --> 29:37.516
Have a ten-foot setback around
each of the, uh, detectors.

29:37.668 --> 29:40.277
Unfortunately,
that compromises our ability

29:40.428 --> 29:41.928
To follow these tunnels.

29:41.947 --> 29:46.508
<i> So, we have to try to find</i>
<i> another way around the issue.</i>

29:46.601 --> 29:47.934
Can you extend the purple line

29:47.953 --> 29:50.846
-Of the original tunnel for me?
-Steve: Oh, I sure can.

29:50.864 --> 29:54.607
I'll extend it through
our money pit pad for you.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.868
-Okay, there we go.
-Rick: Okay, perfect.

29:57.021 --> 30:00.205
There is a spot there where
I'd be comfortable drilling.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.799
Where's that?

30:03.377 --> 30:04.301
Rick:
Come right. Down.

30:04.452 --> 30:06.452
-Right there.
-Steve: Right here?

30:06.547 --> 30:09.455
I'll put a point there.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.533
Rick: I'd be comfortable
drilling that.

30:11.626 --> 30:14.219
We're only like
a foot in, maybe.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.980
When they created that setback,
they said to us...

30:17.207 --> 30:18.482
Yep.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.466
..."we're
being overly cautious."

30:20.561 --> 30:21.560
Scott:
That's right.

30:21.712 --> 30:24.229
I-I think that's
a safe location as well.

30:24.381 --> 30:25.305
Mm-hmm.

30:25.399 --> 30:26.398
But if we do drill there,

30:26.550 --> 30:27.825
And we do hit,
what does it tell us?

30:28.052 --> 30:31.495
The objective for me is we
want to get a sonar down there

30:31.722 --> 30:34.406
And image it to the south
and to the north.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.574
It may be open.

30:35.668 --> 30:39.652
It may be open quite
a distance to the north.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.988
And that would be very
helpful to know that

30:42.007 --> 30:47.736
Because it's such close
proximity to the garden shaft.

30:47.754 --> 30:49.921
It might be a potential target
for tunneling

30:50.074 --> 30:54.017
Or expanding the bottom
of the garden shaft.

30:54.244 --> 30:55.427
Yep.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.837
That's my vote.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.674
That's about as far north
as we can go, given the setback

31:01.694 --> 31:03.935
For protecting the muon hole.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.422
So, I think we try to
reacquire the tunnel there.

31:07.441 --> 31:08.848
Yep.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.516
And we're going to adjust
every time we drill a hole.

31:10.611 --> 31:12.852
This is not a fixed grid.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.780
This is jumping
from one piece of data

31:15.875 --> 31:18.691
To the next piece of data
to the next piece of data.

31:18.785 --> 31:20.210
Steve:
Yep. I like that.

31:20.362 --> 31:22.604
Maybe there's a little bit of
gold at the end of this rainbow.

31:22.623 --> 31:24.214
Rick:
Maybe.

31:24.775 --> 31:27.609
Okay, well, we have a plan.

31:27.702 --> 31:29.177
That's where we're going
to go next.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.221
Okay?

31:31.373 --> 31:32.222
All right. You and I
should head back.

31:32.449 --> 31:33.539
-Should we go get prepped then?
-Yep.

31:33.634 --> 31:34.558
Okay, let's do that.

We saw this in
a couple of previous holes.

31:46.647 --> 31:49.481
Ij-15.25 is going to fulfill

32:32.451 --> 32:33.692
It could go to the garden shaft.

He has an extensive resume

33:13.734 --> 33:16.642
In the field of archaeology.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.995
Gary, we have him

33:18.222 --> 33:20.831
-So, if you could bring him up.
-Yep, sure.

-Good morning, dr. Barnhart.
-Hello, mate.

33:23.818 --> 33:25.985
<i> -Good morning.</i>
-Welcome to the war room.

33:26.005 --> 33:29.006
I know that we have sent
you off a picture of the item

33:29.157 --> 33:32.901
We have here and our hope is
that you can, uh,

33:32.919 --> 33:36.662
Render an opinion as to
what it might represent,

33:36.757 --> 33:38.089
Based on your experience.

33:38.183 --> 33:42.077
<i> Well, I've spent a lot</i>
<i> of my career in mesoamerica.</i>

33:42.095 --> 33:46.081
<i>I've also done a lot of work in</i>
<i>north america and south america.</i>

33:46.099 --> 33:50.101
<i> So, I have a pretty good range</i>
<i> of the americas in general.</i>

33:50.254 --> 33:54.031
<i> I specialize mostly</i>
<i> in archeoastronomy</i>

33:54.182 --> 33:58.760
<i> And ancient sciences,</i>
<i> but that includes metallurgy.</i>

33:59.204 --> 34:01.112
<i> Here we have, uh, what</i>
<i> appears to be a metal object</i>

34:01.265 --> 34:04.099
<i> And it does have</i>
<i> some iconography on it.</i>

34:04.117 --> 34:09.046
<i>It has a number of elements that</i>
<i>might turn out to be diagnostic</i>

34:09.197 --> 34:12.198
<i> Where we can really say,</i>
<i> you know, where it came from.</i>

34:12.217 --> 34:16.035
<i> And it looks like</i>
<i> it has some element</i>

34:16.129 --> 34:18.947
Of perishable materials, too,
that we might be able to date.

34:18.965 --> 34:22.875
So, yes,
I'm really interested in

34:22.969 --> 34:24.728
Digging into it deeper.

34:24.879 --> 34:27.789
Dr. Barnhart,
in your experience, um,

34:27.882 --> 34:29.624
Does anything just
jump into your head

34:29.643 --> 34:30.809
When you first look at it?

34:30.961 --> 34:33.052
We initially, at first glance,

34:33.072 --> 34:35.130
Thought, "oh, there's a pattern
on there."

34:35.148 --> 34:39.058
<i>Well, the pattern is intriguing,</i>
<i>but it's, uh, purely geometric.</i>

34:39.078 --> 34:43.154
I wish we had a foot or an arm
sticking in there somewhere,

34:43.307 --> 34:45.990
<i> But geometry is</i>
<i> kind of all over the planet,</i>

34:46.143 --> 34:48.734
<i> So that does not</i>
<i> narrow it down for us</i>

34:48.829 --> 34:50.812
<i>About what region or what time.</i>

34:50.905 --> 34:54.574
Initially, we thought
it was stamped,

34:54.593 --> 34:56.835
But the symbols on it,

34:56.987 --> 34:59.337
If we can call them symbols,

34:59.431 --> 35:00.597
Are not uniform.

35:00.748 --> 35:03.842
It's quite irregular
in terms of its design.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.177
And that's what made us
think that, you know,

35:06.330 --> 35:10.923
Certainly this was
an artisan or-or hand-created.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.851
Right.
It's basically embossed.

35:13.003 --> 35:14.778
<i> Ed: I think you're right</i>
<i> on the money there.</i>

35:14.929 --> 35:17.948
If it isn't a consistent,
uh, shape

35:18.099 --> 35:19.950
To each one
of the things we can see,

35:20.177 --> 35:22.285
Probably handmade
rather than a factory.

35:22.437 --> 35:27.532
<i> That in and of itself</i>
<i> leans towards an older date.</i>

35:28.018 --> 35:30.018
<i> But the material seems to be</i>

35:30.111 --> 35:33.296
<i> Some sort of</i>
<i> copper-based plating.</i>

35:33.448 --> 35:39.027
There are not a lot of things
made beyond gold and silver.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.213
<i> Things that were</i>
<i> alloy technology</i>

35:42.366 --> 35:45.976
<i> Are few and far between</i>
<i> in the americas.</i>

35:46.127 --> 35:49.128
<i> So, it's already, uh,</i>
<i> a long shot</i>

35:49.148 --> 35:54.300
That it's from the americas,
being the material it is.

35:55.136 --> 35:58.137
Rick: Upon initial
visualization of this item,

35:58.157 --> 36:01.140
Can you reflect
on what it might be?

36:01.160 --> 36:05.403
Sure. It's probably something
that once covered an object.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.830
As decoration?

36:06.981 --> 36:08.723
As decoration, yes.

36:08.816 --> 36:10.983
<i> But it's some sort of ornate</i>

36:11.003 --> 36:13.653
<i> Metallic cover to an object.</i>

36:13.672 --> 36:16.006
<i> Europeans did a lot of that.</i>

36:16.157 --> 36:19.158
They covered
boxes and furniture.

36:19.178 --> 36:22.237
<i> So, it could have</i>
<i> come from afar.</i>

36:22.255 --> 36:25.089
<i> It does have</i>
<i> some iconography on it,</i>

36:25.184 --> 36:28.834
<i> So it could be some sort of</i>
<i> religious object.</i>

36:28.854 --> 36:30.353
Rick:
Really?

36:34.251 --> 36:35.007
Wow.

you can make?

There's the big daddy.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.183
-Roger: There's our friends.
-Rick: There they are.

38:15.201 --> 38:18.353
<i> Narrator: ...Rick lagina,</i>
<i> along with roger fortin,</i>

38:18.371 --> 38:22.023
<i>Eagerly welcome representatives</i>
<i> from irving equipment ltd.</i>

38:22.116 --> 38:24.950
<i> Who are delivering</i>
<i> a 109-ton crane</i>

38:24.970 --> 38:27.378
<i> Needed for the next phase</i>
<i> of construction</i>

38:27.472 --> 38:28.880
<i> In the garden shaft.</i>

38:29.032 --> 38:31.791
With this piece of gear,
y-you're set to rock and roll.

38:31.885 --> 38:33.310
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

38:33.461 --> 38:35.312
-Morning, gentlemen.
-Roger: Good morning.
How are you?

38:35.539 --> 38:36.629
-Morning.
-Morning.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.130
I think I certainly
recognize the two of you.

38:38.224 --> 38:40.466
-You know this fellow, right?
-I know michel, absolutely.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.543
How you doing?

38:41.561 --> 38:42.710
Michel:
Good, good, you?

38:42.729 --> 38:44.562
So, roger can speak
to where they're at,

38:44.656 --> 38:45.822
But I think, you know,

38:46.049 --> 38:48.049
This is the-the key,
critical component, right?

38:48.142 --> 38:50.160
Oh. Yeah. We're at the point
right now

38:50.311 --> 38:52.144
-Where you guys are coming in
at a perfect time.
-Bill p.: Awesome.

38:52.238 --> 38:54.814
Roger:
Because we need your help to get
that hammer grab down there

38:54.833 --> 38:56.649
And get excavating.
So, we're all anxious

38:56.743 --> 38:58.393
And we're all raring to go.

38:58.411 --> 38:59.561
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

38:59.654 --> 39:00.895
Bill p.:
We'll offload from the trailer

39:00.988 --> 39:02.413
-And start to put
the crane together.
-Yeah.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.581
Once it's complete here,

39:03.675 --> 39:05.416
We can crawl up to site,

39:05.510 --> 39:06.584
And we're ready to roll.

39:06.736 --> 39:07.827
-Yeah, I love the sound of that.
-Awesome.

39:07.921 --> 39:09.253
-Roger: Yep.
-Awesome.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.163
-Rick: Let's get after it.
-Roger: All right, sounds good.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.924
-Bill p.: Thanks, guys.
-Roger: Talk to you later.

39:13.076 --> 39:13.925
-Bill p.: Talk to you later.
-Roger: Yep.

39:14.077 --> 39:15.577
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> We have real data</i>

39:15.595 --> 39:16.669
<i> That strongly suggests</i>

39:16.763 --> 39:18.746
<i>That the garden shaft might have</i>

39:18.765 --> 39:20.765
<i> Some answers to understanding</i>

39:20.917 --> 39:22.192
The complexity
of the oak island mystery.

39:22.343 --> 39:26.696
Bill p.:
Come this way another
foot or two. That's good.

39:27.348 --> 39:29.257
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Now that the steel</i>
<i> and concrete foundation</i>

39:29.275 --> 39:32.035
<i> Surrounding the garden shaft</i>
<i> has been completed,</i>

39:32.262 --> 39:35.263
<i> In the coming days,</i>
<i> the massive crane</i>

39:35.281 --> 39:38.691
<i> Will be used along</i>
<i> with a 3-ton hammer grab tool</i>

39:38.710 --> 39:39.951
<i> In order to remove the muck</i>

39:40.045 --> 39:43.028
<i> And sediment from the old,</i>
<i> dilapidated shaft.</i>

39:43.048 --> 39:46.290
<i> This will allow</i>
<i> the representatives from dumas</i>

39:46.385 --> 39:49.277
<i> To begin construction</i>
<i> of the new waterproof shaft</i>

39:49.295 --> 39:52.538
<i> Down to a level</i>
<i> of at least 80 feet.</i>

39:53.058 --> 39:55.950
-Michel: Are we good?
-Bill p.: Yeah.

39:56.469 --> 39:58.878
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> Is it possible that</i>
<i> we've come full circle?</i>

39:58.897 --> 40:00.212
We applied all this technology

40:00.232 --> 40:04.550
Only to arrive where
the original searchers started?

40:05.128 --> 40:06.477
<i> By digging a shaft down,</i>
<i> we might actually learn</i>

40:06.630 --> 40:09.964
<i> What happened here and</i>
<i>potentially recover a treasure.</i>

40:10.057 --> 40:13.368
It's romantic as can be.
And it's exciting.

40:16.306 --> 40:17.972
<i> We're going</i>
<i> to actually go underground.</i>

40:18.065 --> 40:20.232
<i> But the cool thing to me is</i>

40:20.326 --> 40:23.978
<i>That we're coming clear back to</i>
<i>what the original searchers did,</i>

40:23.997 --> 40:26.906
Only maybe this time
we'll be successful.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.425
Bill p.:
This way a bit.

40:28.576 --> 40:30.985
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> There's a lot of hope</i>
<i> it will tell a story</i>

40:31.004 --> 40:32.912
That is related to the mystery.

40:33.006 --> 40:35.990
-Whoa, good.
-Awesome.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.159
-Roger: Pretty exciting.
-Rick: Yes, it is.

40:38.252 --> 40:40.995
As much work as
you've done for the prep,

40:41.088 --> 40:42.997
-This is when it starts.
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

40:43.016 --> 40:47.185
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> The tireless efforts of rick,</i>
<i> marty, craig and their team</i>

40:47.279 --> 40:50.338
<i> May soon be rewarded</i>
<i> with the ultimate validation.</i>

40:50.431 --> 40:53.766
<i> One that would be not</i>
<i> only for themselves,</i>

40:53.785 --> 40:56.177
<i> But also for the generations</i>

40:56.270 --> 40:58.288
<i> Of devoted searchers</i>
<i> who came before them.</i>

40:58.515 --> 41:02.200
<i> As more clues surface</i>
<i> that may soon identify</i>

41:02.352 --> 41:05.186
<i> Just who was behind</i>
<i> the oak island mystery,</i>

41:05.205 --> 41:09.040
<i> Could this team</i>
<i> be one last dig away</i>

41:09.134 --> 41:13.361
<i> From revealing a vast treasure</i>
<i> hidden deep below?</i>

41:13.713 --> 41:14.954
<i> Or will the mysterious forces</i>

41:15.048 --> 41:20.560
<i> Of the island once again</i>
<i> intervene to stop them?</i>

41:21.871 --> 41:24.797
<i> Next time on</i>
the curse of oak island...

41:24.816 --> 41:25.965
Alex:
Here we go.

41:26.059 --> 41:27.299
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> We're going to run</i>

41:27.319 --> 41:28.876
<i> A geophysical investigation</i>
<i> in the swamp.</i>

41:28.895 --> 41:29.819
-Whoa.
-Big one?

41:29.971 --> 41:31.546
Jeremy:
Yeah. Big hit.

41:31.639 --> 41:32.547
Fantastic.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.715
(cheering)

41:33.733 --> 41:34.899
-I see it.
-Oh, I see it as well, look.

41:35.051 --> 41:36.718
Oh, I mean, this is nice.

41:36.736 --> 41:37.902
Oh!

41:38.054 --> 41:39.220
The bottom dropped right out
from under you.

41:39.239 --> 41:41.146
-That's right.
-This is not a natural cavity.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.907
-That doesn't happen.
-We better get a camera down it.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.242
Scott:
Here we go.

41:44.394 --> 41:45.893
-Keep going.
-There's the edge
of something.

41:45.912 --> 41:47.061
Wait, no. Stop.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.580
Some sort of like
pedestal sticking up.
