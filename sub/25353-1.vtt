02:56.384 --> 02:59.137
-The party is a delight.
-Thank you!

04:45.660 --> 04:46.995
Hurry up, girls!

04:47.078 --> 04:48.162
It's dinner time!

05:17.900 --> 05:20.069
The drivers out back,
they took everything.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.406
They live to eat.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.487
Is he dead?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.202
Is he dead? Is Rafid dead?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.124
Months... Six months.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.460
He comes to me.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.297
I turn around and he's there...

09:08.381 --> 09:09.382
on the street.

09:11.759 --> 09:12.843
No! In Spain.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.053
He lives in Spain now.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.429
He cooks to make a restaurant.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.349
Why are you angry?

09:27.066 --> 09:27.900
His passport...

09:29.068 --> 09:31.112
He took a Spanish passport.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.738
A new name.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.657
He says no one can know.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.659
If I tell anyone, he loses everything!

09:36.742 --> 09:38.494
I promised him!

10:07.189 --> 10:08.065
Are you okay?

10:08.649 --> 10:09.650
What is it? What's wrong?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.436
Move!

11:28.437 --> 11:29.438
Get him out!

11:35.611 --> 11:36.570
No!

11:37.154 --> 11:39.115
No! Please!

11:39.198 --> 11:40.199
Take me!

11:41.200 --> 11:42.618
Leave her!

11:44.495 --> 11:45.704
Drop your weapon!

11:47.581 --> 11:48.874
Come here, Karim!

11:57.216 --> 11:59.635
Drop your weapon! Or I kill her.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.767
Please, no!

12:11.021 --> 12:12.064
Please!

12:21.824 --> 12:23.200
Go! Go!

43:58.677 --> 43:59.678
Sit.

44:01.347 --> 44:02.556
We've been waiting.

44:24.036 --> 44:27.206
How may we be sure that this man is alive?

44:27.289 --> 44:28.666
You will trust in my word.

44:28.749 --> 44:30.000
Which one of you is Skiles?

44:34.588 --> 44:37.341
We are concerned that the...

44:38.676 --> 44:40.427
My question remains unanswered!

44:43.389 --> 44:44.807
I am curious...

44:45.557 --> 44:46.934
My friends are curious.

44:47.017 --> 44:50.604
How is it that I can help
where others cannot?

44:50.687 --> 44:51.939
No, no, no, no!

44:52.022 --> 44:53.649
I'm not here to answer questions.

44:53.732 --> 44:56.527
I'm here to tell you what must happen.

44:57.569 --> 44:58.946
Sir...

44:59.530 --> 45:02.408
Demands can be thrown
through the Embassy window.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.326
We've come to hear
the sound of your voice.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.702
And to let you hear the sound of ours.

45:05.786 --> 45:06.745
My voice?

45:07.329 --> 45:09.665
These men should speak!

45:09.748 --> 45:11.875
This man saw his mother
and sister blown up

45:11.959 --> 45:14.628
two days ago at Barjesh Kjehelem.

45:15.462 --> 45:17.923
Do you know that sound?

45:18.006 --> 45:22.261
The sound of American bombs
falling from Zionist planes.

45:22.344 --> 45:25.264
Perhaps you should ask him
what it is he needs!

45:25.347 --> 45:26.223
Sir!

45:26.306 --> 45:27.599
Enough!

45:29.268 --> 45:30.769
So... Tell us. Tell us.

45:33.230 --> 45:36.066
What is the price of our man's freedom?

45:36.150 --> 45:37.067
The price?

45:37.860 --> 45:39.319
Where do you think you are, the souk?

45:40.863 --> 45:42.739
You think we're selling you lipstick?

45:53.459 --> 45:54.710
What have you done? Don't question me.

45:59.715 --> 46:00.966
Take him out of here.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.688
Everything is okay!

1:00:41.804 --> 1:00:42.930
Come, come!

1:00:43.014 --> 1:00:46.017
We don't have a lot of time.

1:01:24.764 --> 1:01:26.808
He disappeared. Let's move.

1:01:29.394 --> 1:01:30.395
Slow down!

1:01:41.489 --> 1:01:42.824
Slow down. Follow me!

1:01:56.587 --> 1:01:58.131
No, no further.

1:02:00.466 --> 1:02:01.384
Stop!

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:04.303
Stop!

1:02:05.346 --> 1:02:06.556
Stop!

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:18.192
Get in!

1:02:59.233 --> 1:03:00.485
Find a place to stop.

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:12.205
Get out.

1:03:15.082 --> 1:03:16.334
Get out!

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:26.010
Get out!

1:05:43.731 --> 1:05:45.566
I'm not staying.

1:05:45.650 --> 1:05:47.360
Another one for me, please.

1:09:01.762 --> 1:09:02.805
Look for channel 5!

1:09:57.902 --> 1:09:58.903
He disappeared.

1:09:58.986 --> 1:10:01.071
Come back. We're going to leave.

1:10:47.034 --> 1:10:48.035
Thank you.

1:12:04.361 --> 1:12:05.529
Stop where you are.

1:12:07.656 --> 1:12:08.657
Don't move.

1:12:15.748 --> 1:12:16.790
Put this on.

1:12:38.103 --> 1:12:40.022
Go left on Rue de l'ArmÃ©e!

1:12:51.700 --> 1:12:52.534
Search him!

1:12:53.577 --> 1:12:54.828
Let's go, search him.

1:13:19.645 --> 1:13:20.687
Come on, hurry!

1:19:07.409 --> 1:19:09.077
Come up, come up. He's here.

1:21:11.658 --> 1:21:12.784
Yes, I'm here.

1:21:29.217 --> 1:21:30.969
What are we doing?

1:21:33.930 --> 1:21:35.724
Get the car.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:53.004
Put them in back.

1:25:37.048 --> 1:25:38.466
Sandrine?

1:25:38.550 --> 1:25:39.551
My love!

1:25:50.770 --> 1:25:52.021
Listen closely, Bashir.

1:25:53.606 --> 1:25:55.817
You're going to tell me
what I want to know

1:25:55.900 --> 1:25:58.236
or this is the last breath you'll take.

1:25:58.319 --> 1:25:59.237
What the fuck nonsense is this?

1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:01.239
Rafid Abu Rajal!

1:26:01.322 --> 1:26:03.158
Where is he?

1:26:03.241 --> 1:26:04.325
Where?

1:26:06.035 --> 1:26:08.371
You're not my only option, Bashir.

1:26:15.336 --> 1:26:16.212
Kill her.

1:26:23.011 --> 1:26:24.679
-The gun?
-Do what I tell you!

1:26:26.181 --> 1:26:27.098
It's going to make too much noise.

1:26:28.099 --> 1:26:29.726
In the bedroom, then. Go! Kill her.

1:26:35.523 --> 1:26:36.900
What craziness is this?

1:26:36.983 --> 1:26:39.736
You let a woman tell you what to do?

1:26:52.916 --> 1:26:54.751
Let's try one more time.

1:26:57.712 --> 1:26:58.671
Rafid Abu Rajal?

1:26:59.631 --> 1:27:00.632
Where is he?

1:28:12.996 --> 1:28:14.122
Get ready.

1:29:28.571 --> 1:29:29.614
<i>Two cars approaching.</i>

1:29:30.948 --> 1:29:32.033
Which direction?

1:29:32.116 --> 1:29:33.826
<i>Southeast on Rue de Damas.</i>

1:29:35.578 --> 1:29:37.246
<i>Okay, pick your spot.</i>

1:32:05.895 --> 1:32:07.230
We've waited too long. Let's get out of here!

1:32:12.652 --> 1:32:15.112
Listen, I want to go! Let's go.

1:32:17.281 --> 1:32:18.282
Go! Let's go.

1:32:29.293 --> 1:32:30.211
Heads up!

1:32:30.294 --> 1:32:31.545
300 meters.

1:32:32.421 --> 1:32:33.714
It's the Christian militia.

1:32:42.473 --> 1:32:44.392
I'll talk our way through.

1:32:44.475 --> 1:32:46.519
With Abu Rajal in the car? Impossible!

1:32:49.939 --> 1:32:51.565
-Rami, no!
-I'm going through!

1:32:57.363 --> 1:32:58.281
We can make it!

1:33:21.512 --> 1:33:22.680
You're crazy!

1:33:35.943 --> 1:33:37.236
They're not coming!

1:33:40.740 --> 1:33:42.408
Come on, they're not coming!

1:33:51.917 --> 1:33:53.127
Turn off the engine.

1:33:54.211 --> 1:33:55.212
Turn it off!

1:34:24.992 --> 1:34:25.951
Stay alert!

1:34:37.129 --> 1:34:40.716
May this be your last lucky day,
you son of a whore!

1:34:42.093 --> 1:34:43.552
You're right. He's right.

1:36:55.809 --> 1:36:56.810
Cut him loose.

1:37:26.507 --> 1:37:27.675
Go!

1:38:08.507 --> 1:38:09.508
Little brother!

1:38:17.975 --> 1:38:20.853
I knew you'd be safe.

1:38:22.396 --> 1:38:23.814
Let him go.

1:38:29.570 --> 1:38:31.655
And I thank you, brother.

1:38:34.074 --> 1:38:35.117
Rafid, no!

1:38:35.701 --> 1:38:37.119
Curse me, do you?

1:38:37.202 --> 1:38:38.287
What's he doing?

1:38:38.370 --> 1:38:39.538
You're free, Rafid.

1:38:39.622 --> 1:38:40.497
Curse me now!

1:39:45.229 --> 1:39:48.023
Bernard! Great!

1:39:48.107 --> 1:39:49.400
Get in! Get in!

1:39:50.275 --> 1:39:51.777
Sandrine!

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:53.195
Get in! Good girl!
