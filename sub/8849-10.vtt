01:07.735 --> 01:09.703
- I GATHER THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME

01:09.737 --> 01:12.740
YOU'VE HELPED A WOMAN
INTO HER CLOTHING?

01:12.773 --> 01:16.277
- NOR IS IT THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE BEEN HELPED INTO YOURS.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.182
- WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT IT WAS?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.883
- WHY, I'D SAY
YOU'VE KEPT POOR COMPANY.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.820
[smack]
- [scoffs]

01:26.854 --> 01:30.724
COMPANY HAS A WAY
OF DAMAGING A GIRL'S REPUTATION.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.627
- THAT WAS NOT THE PASSION
OF A WOMAN OVERLY CONCERNED

01:33.661 --> 01:36.230
WITH HER REPUTATION.

01:36.264 --> 01:40.668
- THAT WAS THE TRIUMPH
OF CURIOSITY OVER EXPERIENCE.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.303
- SEVERAL TRIUMPHS...

01:42.336 --> 01:44.772
AT LEAST THREE.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.806
- TWO...

01:45.839 --> 01:47.641
MAYBE.

01:47.675 --> 01:51.812
- WELL, TWO SO FAR.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.248
- I LOVE MY WORK, MR. CAMPBELL.
- MM-HMM.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.650
- I WOULD HATE TO THINK
THAT I'D ALLOW MY CURIOSITY

01:56.684 --> 01:58.319
TO JEOPARDIZE THAT.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.687
- AND I LOVE WOMEN,
MISS ELLISON.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.855
YOU MAY REST ASSURED,

02:01.889 --> 02:04.292
I AM DISCREET.

[train whistle blowing]

02:35.656 --> 02:39.727
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.896
[train whistle blowing]

03:23.637 --> 03:26.274
- MOVE IT.
COME ON.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.933
- AIN'T GOT TO BE THIS WAY.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.641
YOU BOYS COULD JUST STEP ASIDE.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.643
LET US PASS.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.313
HOW ABOUT THAT?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.063

UH-UH.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.673
THAT AIN'T NO PLAYTHING.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.975
YOU WAIT UNTIL I TEACH YA.
ALL RIGHT?

06:17.611 --> 06:19.880
I GUESS
YOU'RE ABOUT OLD ENOUGH.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.051
GO ON.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.922
- EZRA!

06:28.956 --> 06:32.693
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.729
DON'T THROW ME A SASSY LOOK.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.531
THERE'S PLENTY OF WASH
TO BE HUNG.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.100
- PLENTY OF FISH
IN THE CREEK TOO.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.470
GO ON.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.941
- THAT MAN...

06:47.975 --> 06:51.579
SIDNEY SNOW--
DID YOU GET HIM?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.814
- NOT YET, NO.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.782
- YOU WILL?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.222
- THE MEN ARE REFUSING
TO GO BACK TO WORK.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.057
THEY WON'T SET FOOT
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH,

07:04.091 --> 07:05.893
AND I CAN'T SAY I BLAME THEM.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.496
- THOSE WANTED POSTERS
ARE SITTING ON CAMPBELL'S DESK.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.798
I'M SURE ME OWN
IS RIGHT THERE ON TOP.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.566
- SIDNEY SNOW TURNED TAIL,

07:12.600 --> 07:14.234
AND WE JUST STOOD DOWN THE LAST
OF THE DEPUTIES.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.836
AIN'T NOBODY
TO ENFORCE THEM POSTERS.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.505
- EXCEPT CAMPBELL.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.507
I SAY WE KILL HIM.
- PEOPLE GOT KILLED ALREADY.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.510
- THE MEN NEED ASSURANCES,
AS DO I.

07:25.613 --> 07:29.550
- LET'S GO GET 'EM, THEN.
YOU STAY HERE.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.860
- YOU'D HAVE NO DRINKING
WITH MY CREW OF SAINTS,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.662
MR. HUNTINGTON,

07:41.695 --> 07:44.197
NO GAMBLING OR CAROUSING.

07:44.231 --> 07:48.135
- NO. THOSE ARE UNION PACIFIC
PROBLEMS, MR. YOUNG,

07:48.168 --> 07:50.538
FOUND AMONGST
AN IRISH LABOR FORCE.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.807
I HAVE NONE
OF THAT WITH MY CHINESE.

07:53.841 --> 07:58.879
- MR. HUNTINGTON, I CAME
INTO THIS WORLD WITH NOTHING--

07:58.912 --> 08:01.549
NO LAND, NO MONEY,
NO EDUCATION,

08:01.549 --> 08:03.584
NO PROSPECTS.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.986
AS A YOUNG MAN,
I OFTEN WENT WITHOUT FOOD

08:06.019 --> 08:09.690
AND LEARNED TO SAVOR THE TASTE
OF WILD SPARROW.

08:09.723 --> 08:13.894
THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD,
I HAVE BUILT A SMALL EMPIRE

08:13.927 --> 08:16.897
HERE ON THE EDGE
OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.866
WHERE I AM PAVING THE WAY
TO ZION.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.670
I HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED
THESE THINGS BY DOING BUSINESS

08:22.703 --> 08:25.238
WITH MEN WHO WOULD TAKE
FOR GRANTED THE HARD-WON BOUNTY

08:25.272 --> 08:29.577
OF MY TABLE OR ENDEAVOR
TO WASTE MY PRECIOUS TIME.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.144
- I ADMIRE
YOUR TENACIOUS WILL, SIR,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.714
AND I WOULDN'T DREAM
OF WASTING YOUR TIME.

08:33.747 --> 08:37.084
NOW, THE CELESTIALS SUIT
MY NEEDS IN ALMOST EVERY WAY.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.586
THEY ARE HARDY, HEALTHY,

08:38.619 --> 08:41.622
AND THEY WORK FOR PENNIES
ON THE DOLLAR.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.223
BUT THEY ARE PRONE
TO WORK STOPPAGES,

08:43.256 --> 08:45.058
THE WORST OF WHICH
I AM IN THE MIDST OF NOW.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.228
- WHAT DO THEY EAT?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.898
- EXCUSE ME?
- GUNDERSEN?

08:50.931 --> 08:53.266
- THEIR FOOD.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.269
WHAT DO YOU FEED THEM?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.672
- YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE MY WARD CLERK.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.608
HE'S NEW TO LION HOUSE.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.943
DOESN'T YET
UNDERSTAND OUR MANNERS.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
- FORGIVE ME.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.114
I AM BUT A POOR SINNER...

09:07.147 --> 09:09.950
UNWORTHY, IGNORANT,
A FOOL.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.284
PLEASE.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.787
- AS I WAS ABOUT TO SAY,

09:13.821 --> 09:19.126
SLOTH IS A SIN COMMON
TO SONS OF HAM,

09:19.159 --> 09:22.663
BUT RARE INDEED AMONG MORMONS.

09:22.696 --> 09:27.635
I COULD EASILY PROVIDE YOU
WITH OVER 800 WORKERS.

09:30.904 --> 09:35.643
- * I HATES THE YANKEE NATION
AND EVERYTHING THEY DO *

09:35.676 --> 09:40.047
* I HATES THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE TOO *

09:40.080 --> 09:44.785
* I HATES THE GLORIOUS UNION
THAT'S DRIVEN WITH OUR BLOOD *

09:46.353 --> 09:48.989
* I HATES THE STRIFE
OF BATTLE-- *

09:53.827 --> 09:56.964
* THAT HURTED ALL MY KIN

09:56.997 --> 09:59.900
[humming]

09:59.933 --> 10:07.007
*

10:07.040 --> 10:10.110
- GENTLEMEN...

10:10.143 --> 10:11.812
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

10:11.845 --> 10:15.248
- WE GOT HERE, JOHN, BY WAY
OF YOUR PERNICIOUS ATTACKS

10:15.282 --> 10:17.751
ON MY RAILROAD AND MY PERSON.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.320
- RAILROAD IS MIRED
IN CORRUPTION AND INCOMPETENCE.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.823
- INCOMPETENCE?
- GENTLEMEN.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.325
DON'T MATTER HOW WE GOT HERE.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.695
GOT TO FIND OUR WAY
SOMEWHERES NEW.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.298
NOW, GOVERNOR, MY MEN
ARE GOING BACK TO WORK.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.734
I WANT YOUR GUARANTEE
THEY'LL BE LEFT ALONE.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.103
- THAT REQUEST IS
AN EXCELLENT STARTING PLACE

10:36.136 --> 10:37.170
FOR THIS NEGOTIATION.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.306
- IT IS NOT A REQUEST.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.809
YOU ARE OUTMANNED AND OUTGUNNED,

10:41.842 --> 10:46.179
SO NOW YOU WILL TEAR UP
THOSE RIDICULOUS BOND NOTICES

10:46.213 --> 10:47.380
AND WANTED POSTERS,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.883
AND YOU WILL STOP HARASSING
THE MEN.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.186
- I REMAIN PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR,
NO MATTER YOUR NUMBER OF GUNS.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.322
- YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF
PROVISIONAL KING OF THE WORLD,

10:55.355 --> 10:56.990
FOR ALL I CARE.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.227
- AS SUCH, I WILL NOT ABANDON
THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.331
MY MISTAKE WAS TRYING
TO KEEP THE MATTER PAROCHIAL.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.199
MY MISTAKE, AS I SEE IT NOW,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.902
WAS NOT ESTABLISHING
MARTIAL LAW EARLIER.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.304
- AND I COULD HAVE STAYED
IN MISSISSIPPI FOR MARTIAL LAW.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.907
- NO ONE LIKES MARTIAL LAW,

11:13.941 --> 11:17.745
BUT LACKING ANY CREDIBLE
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT...

11:24.852 --> 11:26.086
- ALL RIGHT.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.088
ALL RIGHT.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.923
I'LL DO IT.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.759
BUT I AIN'T GONNA WEAR
A MARSHAL'S BADGE,

11:31.792 --> 11:34.094
AND I SURE AS HELL
WON'T WORK FOR YOU.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.796
I WORK FOR THE RAILROAD,

11:35.829 --> 11:37.898
AND THAT'S THE ONLY KIND
OF BADGE I'LL WEAR.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.233
- THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,
MR. BOHANNON.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.271
OF COURSE, SHOULD YOU PROVE
YOURSELF UNABLE OR UNWILLING

11:44.304 --> 11:47.007
TO PERFORM YOUR DUTIES
AT ANY TIME,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.176
I WILL NOT HESITATE
TO TELEGRAPH THE FORT.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.779
- NOT NECESSARY.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.784
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.539
IT'S A FIRE!

12:19.572 --> 12:21.141

12:21.174 --> 12:23.410

12:30.417 --> 12:32.886

13:11.992 --> 13:15.362
OPEN THEM.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.266
- SOMEBODY GRAB THEM GUNS
BEFORE THEY GO OFF!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.201
- IT WAS HIM.
IT WAS SIDNEY SNOW.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.036
- MICKEY!

13:23.070 --> 13:26.306
ORGANIZE A BUCKET BRIGADE BEFORE
THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN GOES UP.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.876
- AYE.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.179
EVERY IRISH, NEGRO, COWBOY,
AND KRAUT!

13:32.212 --> 13:34.281
YOU GRAB YOURSELVES A BUCKET!

13:34.314 --> 13:38.986
LET'S SAVE THIS TOWN!

13:39.019 --> 13:41.154
- MR. BOHANNON, I'M OVER HERE!

13:41.188 --> 13:43.023
IF YOU VALUE ME SERVICE AT ALL,

13:43.056 --> 13:47.227
GET A MESSAGE TO ME
SWEETHEART IN LISDOONVARNA.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.899

13:51.932 --> 13:54.968
- TELL HER GO ON AND MARRY
THAT BOLLOCKS DOHERTY.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.071
FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO MAKE HER AN OLD MAID.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.040
- SHUT UP, PADDY..

14:00.073 --> 14:01.641
YOU CAN WRITE
HER YOURSELF TOMORROW.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.310
- I CAN'T READ, SIR.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.913
- CAN'T HELP YOU THERE.
- WATCH IT!

14:07.347 --> 14:10.050
- [screams]

14:15.222 --> 14:16.523
[both coughing]

14:16.556 --> 14:18.926

14:22.195 --> 14:24.331

COME ON.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.567
QUICKLY, LADS!

14:27.600 --> 14:29.369
- COME ON, GET THIS FIRE OUT!

14:29.402 --> 14:32.539
- KEEP 'EM COMING!

14:32.572 --> 14:34.942
- COME ON, FASTER, FASTER.
COME ON, MOVE IT OUT.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.944
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
PICK IT UP!

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
- IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
DOING BUSINESS

15:23.023 --> 15:26.159
WITH A FELLOW PIONEER,
MR. YOUNG.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.262
PLEASE THANK ALL OF YOUR WIVES
FOR THE HEARTIEST HOSPITALITY

15:29.296 --> 15:31.331
I HAVE FELT ON EITHER SIDE
OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.600
- WE'LL MAKE A SAINT
OF YOU YET, MR. HUNTINGTON.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.668
I WILL PRAY FOR YOUR SAFE RETURN
TO SACRAMENTO.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.637
- AND I WILL HOPE
FOR YOUR CONTINUED HEALTH

15:37.670 --> 15:40.340
AND PROSPERITY.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.442
OH, UH, MISTER, UH...

15:42.475 --> 15:44.611
GUNDERSEN, WAS IT?

15:44.644 --> 15:48.148
THAT NAME IS NORWEGIAN,
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.750
- YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN.

15:50.783 --> 15:55.522
- WHY DID YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
KIND OF FEED I GIVE MY CHINAMEN?

16:00.460 --> 16:04.597
- OUR GUEST ASKED YOU
A QUESTION, BROTHER GUNDERSEN.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.035
- I LEARNED DURING THE WAR

16:08.035 --> 16:11.071
THAT AN ARMY RUNS
ON ITS STOMACH,

16:11.104 --> 16:15.442
AND WHAT IS A LABOR FORCE
IF NOT A SMALL ARMY?

16:15.475 --> 16:18.478
- I SEE.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.047
THANK YOU.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.515
- I SPENT YEARS
ON THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD

16:22.549 --> 16:24.317
UNDER THOMAS DURANT.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.552

16:25.585 --> 16:27.687
HE EVER GIVE YOU
THAT DAMN SPEECH OF HIS

16:27.720 --> 16:30.090
ABOUT THE LION AND THE ZEBRA?
- MANY TIMES, YES.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.059
- OH, ABOUT TURNED ME
INTO RIP VAN WINKLE.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.361
- BECAUSE YOU FOUND IT BORING?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.096
- [laughs]

16:36.129 --> 16:38.065
TELL ME, DID YOU EVER
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

16:38.065 --> 16:39.366
TO WORK WITH CULLEN BOHANNON?

16:39.399 --> 16:42.569
THAT MAN IMPRESSES THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.237
- EVERYTHING I KNOW,

16:44.271 --> 16:48.741
I LEARNED BY CAREFUL STUDY
OF CULLEN BOHANNON.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.643
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.180
AND I SUPPOSE I'LL SEE HIM
ON THE DOWNSLOPE SOON ENOUGH.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.183
- PERHAPS YOU COULD USE
A FORMER UNION PACIFIC MAN

16:56.216 --> 17:00.220
TO ACCOMPANY
YOUR FRESH MORMON WORKERS.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.523
THAT IS,

17:03.556 --> 17:06.759
IF BROTHER BRIGHAM
CAN SPARE ME.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.596
- WE WILL DISCUSS IT.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.231
- HMM.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.565
- LEAVE US, GUNDERSEN.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.367
- HMM.
GOOD DAY.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.412
[indistinct chatter]

17:31.251 --> 17:33.853
- YOU.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.788
REMEMBER ME,

17:35.822 --> 17:39.359
YOU NO GOOD TRASH?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.594
- HELP ME.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.768
- LOOK AT ME.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.604
LOOK AT ME!

17:51.638 --> 17:53.773
MY NAME'S EVA.

17:53.806 --> 17:58.478
I'VE BEEN MOTHER,
DAUGHTER, INJUN,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.713
WIFE, AND WHORE.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.149
BUT ALL MY TIME ON THIS EARTH,

18:02.182 --> 18:06.286
I AIN'T EVER MET
A BIGGER PIECE OF SHIT THAN YOU.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.222
HE COULDN'T BE SAVED.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.826
- HAVE YOU SEEN EZRA?

18:46.859 --> 18:49.262
- UH, I'M SORRY.
I HAVEN'T.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.666
- EZRA HASN'T COME BACK.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.935
- I'LL BE OVER AFTER A WHILE.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.839
- HE'S NEVER STAYED OUT
ALL NIGHT.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.376
- HEY, LISTEN, H-H-HE RUN OFF
BEFORE ALL THIS STARTED.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.313
HE--HE'S ALL RIGHT.
- BUT WHERE IS HE?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.248
- PROBABLY JUST TRYING TO STAY
OUT OF THE WAY.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.882
WE'LL FIND HIM.
EZRA!

19:09.916 --> 19:11.451
- EZRA!
- COME ON OUT, NOW!

19:11.484 --> 19:15.222
- EZRA!
- HAVE YOU NOT SEEN HIM, RUTH?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.456
- OH, YOU KNOW HOW BOYS ARE.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.724
HE'S JUST HIDING SOMEWHERES.
EZRA!

19:17.757 --> 19:19.659
- EZRA!

19:19.692 --> 19:22.262
I WON'T BE CROSS!
- EZRA!

19:22.295 --> 19:25.232
- PLEASE!
COME OUT!

19:27.934 --> 19:31.471
- WHAT IS IT?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.873
- THE BACK ROOM.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.708
- NO, CHURCH WAS CLEAR.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.347
- UNDER THE FLOOR.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.420
- RUTH...

20:53.453 --> 20:56.456
- NO.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.724
- PLEASE.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.059
- NO!
- NO, NO.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.628
- GET OFF!
NO!

21:01.661 --> 21:04.030
[screams]

21:06.533 --> 21:09.436
[sobbing and wailing]

21:47.073 --> 21:49.942
- SIDNEY SNOW--
WHERE IS HE?

21:49.976 --> 21:53.446
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.983
- HE'S YOUR MARSHAL.
- AAH!

21:57.016 --> 21:58.385
- I HAVEN'T HAD EYES ON HIM

21:58.418 --> 22:00.487
SINCE HE LEFT
ON THAT PRISON TRAIN.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.455
- HE TAKES HIS ORDERS FROM YOU.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.392
- HEY, THAT MAN'S INCAPABLE
OF TAKING ORDERS FROM ANYONE.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.026
WHOA!
- A CHILD IS DEAD!

22:07.059 --> 22:09.629
- I SWEAR TO YOU BEFORE GOD,

22:09.662 --> 22:12.565
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
HEINOUS CRIMES AT THE CHURCH.

22:12.599 --> 22:15.802
- YOU HIRED THAT SON OF BITCH
WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE HUNG HIM.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.804
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.472
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:19.506 --> 22:23.643
THE BLAME FOR LAST NIGHT'S
TRAGEDY IS MINE.

22:23.676 --> 22:28.515
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE EMPOWERED
SIDNEY SNOW.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.418
- I'VE KILLED
FAR BETTER MEN THAN YOU

22:31.418 --> 22:35.021
FOR DOING A LOT LESS THAN THAT.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.558
- I HAVE NO SHRED OF DOUBT.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.532
I'D LIKE TO OFFER EVERY RESOURCE
AT MY DISPOSAL

22:45.565 --> 22:50.036
TO HELP YOU FIND HIM
AND SEE HIM HANG.

22:59.145 --> 23:02.449
- YOU'RE ALL OUT OF RESOURCES,
FAR AS I CAN TELL.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.587
CAMPBELL DIDN'T KNOW.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.757
- WE SEARCHED THE CASINO,
THE WHOREHOUSE, THE LAUNDRY,

23:10.790 --> 23:12.725
EVERY BLEEDING RAT HOLE
IN CHEYENNE.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.861
- SEARCH AGAIN.
- I'VE SEARCHED IT ALREADY!

23:14.894 --> 23:16.529
- HE'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERES.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.799
- I OVERSAW THE SEARCH MYSELF.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.868
BOHANNON...

23:21.901 --> 23:24.904
- YOU SEEN HIM?
- MM-MM.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.475
- THERE ARE A LOT OF ROTTEN,
MANGY DOGS IN THIS TOWN,

23:28.508 --> 23:32.479
BUT NONE
WHO'D SHELTER A CHILD KILLER.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.114
ALL HE HAD TO WAS HOP
ON A HORSE.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.216
HE'S HALFWAY TO MEXICO BY NOW

23:37.249 --> 23:39.886
OR SOME OTHER ARSEHOLE TOWN
IN THIS WORLD!

23:39.919 --> 23:42.054
- HE AIN'T IN MEXICO.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.490
- CULLEN!

23:47.960 --> 23:49.629
HE'S GONE.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.535
IT'S OVER.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.115
- I HAD HIM, MICKEY...

24:17.990 --> 24:20.527
IN THE GENERAL STORE.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.231
HAD MY GUN TO HIS HEAD.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.536
- WELL,
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HIM?

24:52.091 --> 24:54.561
- RUTH...

24:58.064 --> 25:01.734
WE SEARCHED EVERYWHERES...

25:01.768 --> 25:03.836
AND I WAS TOO SLOW...

25:03.870 --> 25:05.905
STUPID.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.843
I LET SIDNEY GET AWAY.

25:18.284 --> 25:21.654
- WHEN YOU FIRST
BROUGHT HIM TO THE CHURCH,

25:21.688 --> 25:25.992
I WANTED TO SEND HIM
TO THE ORPHANAGE.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.896
I HAD NO BUSINESS
BEING ANYONE'S MOTHER.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.613
- YOU WAS JUST SCARED.

25:49.081 --> 25:53.019
- I NEVER LEARNED
HIS FULL NAME...

25:53.052 --> 25:56.623
NEVER KNEW
WHERE HE CAME FROM...

25:59.325 --> 26:02.028
WHETHER HE HAD BROTHERS
OR SISTERS

26:02.061 --> 26:05.865
OR WHAT BECAME OF HIS FAMILY.

26:05.898 --> 26:10.369
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
A COLICKY BABY OR A HAPPY ONE

26:10.402 --> 26:13.172
OR IF HIS EYES
WERE LIKE HIS FATHER'S.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.645
HE'LL NEVER GO TO SCHOOL...

26:20.780 --> 26:23.082
NEVER HAVE A SWEETHEART...

26:27.286 --> 26:29.188
NEVER GET MARRIED.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.062
HE HATED DOING CHORES.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.931
HE BROUGHT LIVE TOADS
INTO THE CHURCH.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.200
[laughs]

26:43.302 --> 26:45.171
[breathes deeply]

26:45.204 --> 26:48.207
[sniffles]

26:50.843 --> 26:54.213
HE WAS WILD AND HEADSTRONG...

26:56.816 --> 27:00.987
AND I COULD NEVER GET
HIM TO TAKE A BATH.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.222
BUT HE WAS A GOOD BOY.

27:09.328 --> 27:13.265
AND THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM,

27:13.299 --> 27:16.002
I SPOKE TO HIM IN ANGER.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.138
- NO. NO.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.107
YOU WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HIM.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.109
- THE GOOD IT DID.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.712
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN!

27:29.882 --> 27:33.720
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE
OF HIM.

27:37.924 --> 27:41.060
I NEVER DESERVED
TO BE A MOTHER.

27:43.262 --> 27:47.734
[sobbing]

28:09.856 --> 28:14.060
- AH, BROTHER BRIGHAM.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.195
GOOD DAY.

28:16.228 --> 28:19.932
- YOU MADE A FAVORABLE
IMPRESSION ON COLLIS HUNTINGTON.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.037
WE DISCUSSED
YOU ACCOMPANYING THE SAINTS

28:25.071 --> 28:28.074
TO WORK ON THE CENTRAL PACIFIC.

28:28.107 --> 28:31.210
HE'D LIKE YOU ALONG.

28:31.243 --> 28:36.048
- TRULY A MAN OF VISION,
LIKE YOURSELF.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.884
THE HOLY SPIRIT COMPELLED ME

28:37.917 --> 28:41.120
TO--TO REACH OUT TO HIM.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.122
OH!

28:49.495 --> 28:53.232
- I AM GOD'S PROPHET
ON EARTH...

28:56.002 --> 28:59.138
NOT YOU.

28:59.171 --> 29:02.374
- FORGIVE ME, BROTHER BRIGHAM.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.945
I WAS BESTED BY MY PRIDE.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.318
- HEAVENLY FATHER HAS PLANS
FOR YOU HERE.

29:12.351 --> 29:17.223
IN THE FUTURE, IT WOULD BEHOOVE
YOU TO REMEMBER YOUR PLACE.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.492
- OF COURSE.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.996
OH, THANK YOU.

29:24.030 --> 29:28.835
* OH, LION OF THE LORD

29:30.102 --> 29:33.840
- FINISH DRESSING AND PRAY.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.208
THERE'S A WARD MEETING
IN HALF AN HOUR.

29:39.378 --> 29:43.149
- [speaking native language]

29:46.986 --> 29:54.160
- * THAT I SHOULD KNOW
YOUR FACE, MY LOVE *

29:56.362 --> 30:02.869
* LIKE SORROW KNOWS
THE MORNING DOVE *

30:05.905 --> 30:13.913

30:16.582 --> 30:23.956
* COME BACK TO ME
IS MY REQUEST *

30:30.029 --> 30:36.835
* MY OWN TRUE LOVE,
REMEMBER ME *

30:40.172 --> 30:47.413
* WHEN ONCE AGAIN
MY EYES YOU SEE *

30:49.348 --> 30:57.056
* MY HEART LIES
IN A DARKENED PLACE *

31:00.426 --> 31:08.434
* THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
MY WEARY FACE *

31:15.074 --> 31:22.314
* I'LL SEARCH FOR YOU
ON JORDAN SHORE *

31:23.615 --> 31:31.490
* TO HOLD YOU
IN MY ARMS ONCE MORE *

31:35.461 --> 31:42.268
* I'VE TRAVELED DOWN
THIS LONG HARD ROAD *

31:46.105 --> 31:53.980
* AND I'LL NOT EVER
LET YOU GO *

31:58.450 --> 32:05.992

32:11.630 --> 32:18.137
[knock at door]
* IS MY REQUEST

32:36.155 --> 32:40.359
- EVA, I SAW WHAT YOU DID.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.694
- WHAT'D I DO?

32:42.728 --> 32:45.164
- YOU KILLED THAT MAN...

32:45.197 --> 32:48.034
AFTER THE FIRE.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.206
I KNOW HE WAS MONSTROUS.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.043
- YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
BUT WORDS.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.281
- EVA...

33:02.314 --> 33:03.349
I KNOW.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.391
- HE DONE YOU TOO.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.197
- YOU MURDERED HIM.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.199
- WEREN'T EXACTLY MURDER.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.405
- HOW COULD YOU DO IT?

33:26.438 --> 33:28.307
- I NOTICE YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO STOP ME.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.210
- NO.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.412
I MEAN, I...

33:36.282 --> 33:38.550
I...

33:38.584 --> 33:41.087
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.726
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS ELLISON.

33:47.759 --> 33:52.264
YOU AIN'T DONE NOTHING WRONG.

33:52.298 --> 33:55.834
ENOUGH THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU
LONG ENOUGH OUT HERE,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.769
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.239
YOU'LL SEE.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.403
- DON'T.

34:44.683 --> 34:48.287
- YOU WAS ALWAYS THERE
FOR HIM, RUTH.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.459
THAT MEANS A LOT.

35:02.301 --> 35:06.638
- YOU LOST YOUR OWN SON
TO VIOLENCE.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.575
- YEAH, JOSHUA.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.777
HE'S ABOUT EZRA'S AGE.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.183
- HOW DO YOU ENDURE IT?

35:25.557 --> 35:29.195
- AIN'T NOTHING BRINGS PEACE.

35:38.304 --> 35:43.209
- WHEN YOU FIND THE DEVIL
WHO DID THIS TO MY CHILD...

35:44.743 --> 35:47.246
I HOPE YOU RETURN HIM TO HELL

35:47.279 --> 35:51.550
WITH MY WISH
THAT HIS SUFFERING BE DEEP

35:51.583 --> 35:54.386
AND ETERNAL.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.228
[sobs]

36:34.025 --> 36:36.595
- [grunts]

36:36.628 --> 36:38.830
- GOOD MORNING.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.333
RATS?

36:41.367 --> 36:43.435
- IT'S GHOSTS, MORE LIKE.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.771
- HMM.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.574
YES, WELL...

36:48.607 --> 36:50.876
WHEN HANNAH LEFT ME, I...

36:50.909 --> 36:53.712
I ACTUALLY PREFERRED
THE SOLITUDE OF MY PRISON CELL

36:53.745 --> 36:57.283
TO THE EMPTY ROOMS
OF THE FAMILY HOUSE.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.787
OH.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.626
DON'T LET YOUR NEW DUTIES

37:07.659 --> 37:10.829
KEEP YOU
FROM CONQUERING SHERMAN PEAK.

37:15.734 --> 37:19.438
- [breathes deeply]

37:32.751 --> 37:35.321
- I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE

37:35.354 --> 37:38.324
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION
OF JUSTICE IN CHEYENNE.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.338
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.586
- AH, DAMN IT!

38:07.619 --> 38:10.522
- SHE'S NOT A DELICATE LADY,
MR. BOHANNON.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.391
WHAT WE HAVE HERE

38:12.424 --> 38:15.727
IS A STRONG-BACKED,
THICK-THIGHED WHORE.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.999
I'D RECOMMEND

38:21.032 --> 38:23.869
- PLUMBING WRENCH IT IS,

- ANYTHING THAT KEEPS

39:40.779 --> 39:43.782
- ALL RIGHT.

39:43.815 --> 39:47.453
LET'S TALK.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.121
- [laughs]
LOOK AT YOU.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.790
YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY BADGE.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.960
YOU HAD TO GO OUT
AND GET ONE FOR YOURSELF.
