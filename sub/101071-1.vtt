Three days.

41:46.265 --> 41:48.267
I loved him.

41:53.939 --> 41:55.741
It's your fault.

43:31.136 --> 43:33.339
You think
she'll change anything?

43:49.855 --> 43:51.156
He'll cheat.

43:52.524 --> 43:54.193
She'll cheat, too.

43:56.929 --> 43:58.464
They'll all cheat.

46:25.210 --> 46:26.545
Four now.

46:27.579 --> 46:29.381
More later.

46:34.687 --> 46:37.956
Four now. More later.

46:37.990 --> 46:41.160
Four now. More later.

48:55.662 --> 48:57.496
The last lection?

48:58.831 --> 49:00.499
I remember.

49:01.634 --> 49:03.135
What do I need?

49:03.636 --> 49:04.804
Numbers.

49:06.238 --> 49:09.107

- Steel.

49:09.141 --> 49:10.643
Steel?

49:15.347 --> 49:16.348

More bread.

50:46.471 --> 50:48.173
Them.

50:51.410 --> 50:53.245
Us.

53:22.161 --> 53:25.363
It is important we are there,
so to speak,

53:25.397 --> 53:28.768
with our expressions
[inaudible].

53:28.801 --> 53:31.938
Important is primarily
[inaudible] limit

53:31.971 --> 53:35.842
to a finite individual
[inaudible].

53:35.875 --> 53:38.644
Importance is,
it's clearly important.

53:38.678 --> 53:42.148
In some sense or other
I'm going to skip the details.

53:42.181 --> 53:45.617
The importance is derived
from the existing [inaudible].

55:50.810 --> 55:52.544
Them.

55:56.015 --> 55:57.750
Us.

57:10.756 --> 57:12.324
It's good.

58:47.119 --> 58:48.654

01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:19.912
Truth.

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:22.281
Kill Kat.

01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:42.368
No. Stop.

01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:44.470
They killed Paul.

01:00:44.503 --> 01:00:46.472
This place killed Paul.

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:49.141
Please.

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:51.176
Fuck!

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.449
Beth. Crash. Steel.

01:00:57.483 --> 01:00:59.451
This was the cost.

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.959
Go away.

01:01:08.927 --> 01:01:10.829

01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:15.100
Forever.

01:03:35.174 --> 01:03:39.111
Crash. Steel.

01:05:56.248 --> 01:05:57.583

01:06:07.426 --> 01:06:08.628
Mm-Hm?

01:06:12.164 --> 01:06:13.398

01:15:23.282 --> 01:15:26.719
You. You.

01:15:54.847 --> 01:15:58.250
Only black eats.

01:16:48.067 --> 01:16:49.368
Tomorrow.

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:53.372

Mercy.

01:17:46.258 --> 01:17:47.493
No.

01:18:07.946 --> 01:18:08.914
Dot.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.949
Come on.

01:18:16.889 --> 01:18:20.025
Dot. Come on.

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:21.046
It's bad.

01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:29.321
There is no more bread.

01:20:30.757 --> 01:20:33.992
There will be
less bread tomorrow.

01:20:35.662 --> 01:20:37.563
Why are you telling me this?

01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:47.539
You might win.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.421
"The state is an
organization of violence;

01:21:36.455 --> 01:21:40.192
a monopoly in what it is pleased
to call legitimate violence.

01:21:40.225 --> 01:21:41.828
Revolution, my dear prince,

01:21:41.861 --> 01:21:44.697
is not the substitution
of immoral for moral,

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:47.533
or of illegitimate

01:21:47.566 --> 01:21:50.502

Not just a trifle evil.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.575
Monstrously evil.

01:22:31.343 --> 01:22:34.513
Though he still smiled, he was
shaking, only half controlling it.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:40.787
If you want me to help you destroy
a government, I am here to serve.

But as for universal justice..."

01:24:25.658 --> 01:24:27.526
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:24:28.795 --> 01:24:29.962
It's always been this way.

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:34.701
We used to use our words.

01:24:35.467 --> 01:24:38.503
Words? When?

01:24:41.007 --> 01:24:43.308
Do you want her to win?

01:24:46.578 --> 01:24:47.947
I want him to lose.

01:29:03.568 --> 01:29:05.004
Vote!

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:53.085
Bread!

Dot, use the rock.

01:31:48.134 --> 01:31:51.237
Fight! Fight!

01:32:13.225 --> 01:32:19.899
Oh, no. No. No. No.

01:33:41.146 --> 01:33:43.749
Dot, mayor!

There is no more bread.
