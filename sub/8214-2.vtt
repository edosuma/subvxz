00:38.730 --> 00:40.732
*

00:45.170 --> 00:46.171
MAN: All right,
everybody get down!

00:47.780 --> 00:49.748
I said get down!

00:49.780 --> 00:51.668
Not worth the 12 quid an hour,
old timer.

00:51.710 --> 00:52.677
Move it! Go!

00:52.720 --> 00:53.812
Move it!
Open the door!

00:53.850 --> 00:56.182
Nobody move!

00:56.220 --> 00:59.656
Everybody out! Now!
Move! Move! Move!

00:59.690 --> 01:01.817
You, get on the ground!

01:01.860 --> 01:03.680
All of you
on the ground!

01:03.730 --> 01:06.096
Ladies and gentleman,
you're New Yorkers.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.620
You know how this works.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.681
Two minutes!

02:04.650 --> 02:07.289
It's a beautiful sight.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.788
Yes, it is.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.457
Beautiful.

02:11.490 --> 02:13.151
All right.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.771
Time to go.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.708
I'm out of here.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.184
Your job was
to kill both of them.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.451
He'll be dead in five minutes.
I did my job.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.856
You better make sure 'cause
he's seen our faces.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.619
Do him.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.807
WOMAN: ...I don't know;
you were here before I was...

03:01.840 --> 03:03.478
WOMAN 2: Cappuccino with soy,
I ordered that.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.671
Hi.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.277
No, it was a short doppio

03:08.320 --> 03:09.582
with four full pumps
of hazelnut.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.848
Four full pumps.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.584
It's Anne-Marie.
I-I had a regular mocha

03:14.620 --> 03:16.656
with whipped
cream

03:16.690 --> 03:17.725
Just a second.
Excuse me!

03:17.760 --> 03:21.252
This isn't soy.
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.665
Hey, Deedie,
what's the problem?

03:22.700 --> 03:23.496
My pen stopped writing.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.827
Is my drink ready?

03:24.870 --> 03:26.963
"Luca"?
I can't remember the orders.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.729
I got it. Are you ready?
Yeah.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.466
Gordon back here, he's having
a triple espresso, easy foam.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.705
Tammy-Lynn is having
a green tea latte with soy.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.743
We got a regular mocha with
whipped cream for Lance.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.613
Luca is having an unsweetened
jumbo iced coffee.

03:39.650 --> 03:42.289
And Anne-Marie
back here, she's having

03:42.320 --> 03:44.379
a short doppio
with four pumps of hazelnut.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.717
That's four full pumps.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.456
And I'm gonna have four shots
of espresso

03:47.490 --> 03:49.253
over ice with five sugars.

03:49.290 --> 03:50.518
Thank you!

03:50.560 --> 03:52.528
Of course_. _
Can you make mIne first?

03:52.560 --> 03:54.448
I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh, yes.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.764
Hey. I'm ten minutes away.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.688
Iced quad espresso,
five sugars.

03:58.730 --> 03:59.992
Okay, bye.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.669
Breakfast of champions.
Okay. Aw!
Yes, yes.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.577
All right, triple espresso,
easy foam, coming up.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.404
They got five million
in cash

04:11.450 --> 04:13.418
from the Four Aces Casino
In Toronto,

04:13.450 --> 04:15.748
close to eight million
in German bearer bonds

04:15.780 --> 04:17.680
_ from a bank
In San FranCIsco,

04:17.720 --> 04:20.883
and a half a ton of rhino hor_ns
from a warehouse In PretorIa.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.387
You know,
contrary to popular belief,

04:22.430 --> 04:25.319
rhino horn is actually
not an aphrodisiac.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.520
In case anyone was wondering.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.027
Well, now I'm wondering.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.425
ELIOT:
We're talking three
of the richest heists

04:30.470 --> 04:31.767
of the past decade,

04:31.800 --> 04:33.791
all conceived _
by the same mastermInd.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.400
Kilborn-- the man,
the myth, the legend.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.533
Mostly the myth,
since nobody's seen this guy.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.800
Maybe he's not real.
Maybe he's a ghost.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.809
Ghosts don't end up at the top
of the FBI's Most Wanted list.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.670
Kilborn runs his jobs
from behind the scenes.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.075
He never gets his hands dirty.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.042
That's why nobody knows
his identity.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.980
Nobody alive knows his identity.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.386
The RCMP busted a member

04:53.420 --> 04:54.614
of l_(ilborn's
crew In Toronto.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.685
Guy confirmed he was
on the team, that's all.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.550
Got shiwed in prison
two days later.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.592
Kilborn kills
to stay invisible.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.666
We got chatter that says
Kilborn's next score is here

05:02.700 --> 05:04.395
in Manhattan.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.068
He may be
on the FBI's Most Wanted list,

05:06.100 --> 05:07.431
but he's on our turf.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.529
So we make sure
this is his last job.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.537
What's the target?

05:10.570 --> 05:12.435
That's your job to find out.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.698
Without knowing what he looks
like or what he's after.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.970
Eliot, we're good
but not that good.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.341
I'm that good.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.540
I might be able

05:19.580 --> 05:21.468
to help you out.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.385
Eve Steele.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.081
MURRAY: She looks
different in every photo.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.712
ELIOT: Yeah, it's part
of her M.O. She's wanted

05:26.760 --> 05:28.455
out west for a series of heists,

05:28.490 --> 05:30.629
all pretty flashy,
in more ways than one.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.458
She pulled this job
in Phoenix, six weeks ago.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.718
Eve's a chemical expert--
she used thermite

05:35.760 --> 05:39.469
on the armored car.
Wow. You gotta
admire her tradecraft.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.967
You and ATF both.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.935
They passed along a tip to us
that Eve's working for Kilborn.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.530
This is the hottest lead
anyone's ever had on hIm.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.400
Eve arrives
by bus today.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.840
You'll be there to grab her--
discreetly.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.939
WOMAN : Last call
for boarding bus number...

05:57.990 --> 06:00.151
She's probably changed
her appearance.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.385
No match so far.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.648
Jay, you got
any more photos for us?

06:04.690 --> 06:06.624
JAY:
Uploading now.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.390
You know, Carrie,
she kind of looks like you.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.125
Though Eve's auricles
are asymmetric.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.489
CARRIE: You been admiring
my auricles, Jay?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.861
Well, that's nice to know.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.037
You noticed my eyes.

06:16.070 --> 06:18.538
Auricles are earlobes.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.003
You forget to turn your memory
on this morning?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.577
I remember everything, Jay,
I don't know everything.

06:22.610 --> 06:23.907
Although now I know
you like my earlobes,

06:23.950 --> 06:25.941
which is kind of kinlq.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.679
I got her, Al.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.927
Sending Jay a photo.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.621
Firm identity.
JAY: Got it.

06:40.660 --> 06:41.649
Running identity match.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.667
Confirm.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.065
Target is Eve Steele.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.170
You're up.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.643
Hey, there.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.977
You look like
you're new In town.

06:58.010 --> 06:59.648
How about I be
your tour guide, huh?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.874
Back off, jackass.
Aw, come on...

07:00.920 --> 07:03.445
Hey, Eve.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.787
I think you've made
a mistake.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.082
Mm...

07:13.760 --> 07:15.557
I've seen your work, Eve.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.660
That armored truck job could
send you away for a long time.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.500
I liked you better
as a sleazebag.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.667
Play ball with us
and we can help you

07:25.710 --> 07:28.679
cut a deal in Arizona.

07:28.710 --> 07:31.907
So... what brings
you to New York?

07:31.950 --> 07:34.919
I'm big into architecture.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.747
Frank Gehry mostly.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.714
Things that man can do
with a box.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.081
I doubt he can do much with the
box you're gonna end up in.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.226
You'll do a lot
less tIme, Eve,

07:45.260 --> 07:47.922
if you just tell us
about Kilborn.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.894
What's a Kilborn?

07:51.570 --> 07:53.197
AL: Now, let's talk
a little bit about Arizona.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.595
We're cooked if she lawyers up.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.107
She's not gonna do that.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.767
She asks for a lavwer,

07:58.810 --> 08:01.529
Kilborn knows she's talking
to us and he kills her.

08:01.580 --> 08:05.277
Eve's only goal right now is
staying alive.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.609
Well, nothing in Eve's bag
links to nefarious activity.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.811
No weapons or information
on where she's going.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.659
Anything on her phone?
No.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.681
No calls or texts to any numbers
in the greater New York area.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.278
And no e-mails connecting

08:16.320 --> 08:18.185
to anything here.
MURRAY: Well, she's
here for Kilborn.

08:18.230 --> 08:21.552
There has to be evidence
connectIng them.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.660
Okay, at the bus station, Eve
moved a box off of a red bag.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.109
Now, I thought she was
just looking for her luggage,

08:31.140 --> 08:32.266
but why move the box

08:32.310 --> 08:34.505
when Eve's bag is black?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.850
A message.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.698
There was a name and a number.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.961
I got it.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.932
You got what?

09:01.970 --> 09:05.133
A message from Kilborn.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.243
Hi.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.248
Burnsy's upset we're
not hitting it off.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.248
Oh, yeah?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.281
Well, I should cheer him up.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.958
Take him to
this little party

09:20.990 --> 09:23.652
I'm going to
at the Alcazar Hotel,

09:23.690 --> 09:26.727
room 3382, at 5:00 pm.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.890
Doesn't sound like fun.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.660
Oh, the fun part is when
I arrest everyone in that room

09:36.710 --> 09:38.268
_ and tell them
It was because of you.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.838
He'll kill me.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.144
AL:
VVho?

09:47.880 --> 09:48.949
Kilborn.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.244
That name didn't mean anything
to you a minute ago.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.882
Look, Eve, we're going
to the Alcazar Hotel

09:52.920 --> 09:55.889
with or without
your cooperatIon.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.319
We have ways of protecting you.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.794
From Kilborn?

10:00.830 --> 10:03.719
Don't flatter yourself.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.637
Prison, witness protection,

10:06.670 --> 10:08.797
a monastery in Tibet,
he will find me.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.229
Well, then I guess your only
hope of staying alive

10:11.270 --> 10:14.899
is to help us catch him
before he catches you.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.304
I don't know much.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.648
Honest.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.945
Have you worked for him before?

10:24.990 --> 10:26.287
I've never met him.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.914
He's a real cryptic
kind of guy.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.029
But you knew enough
to get instructions

10:30.060 --> 10:32.153
at the bus depot, right?

10:32.190 --> 10:34.124
That message directs me
to the first meet-up.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.663
Kilborn only gives crumbs of
information through the job.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.826
You never get the whole pie.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.098
When were you supposed
to meet him?

10:39.130 --> 10:41.667
I don't think he shows
till we divvy up the score.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.136
Oh, that way, no one can finger
him if the job goes south.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.899
You get any other
instructions?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.943
Just not to share _
any personal InformatIon

10:49.980 --> 10:51.902
with any
of the other crew members.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.372
You can't rat out the others

10:53.420 --> 10:55.411
'cause none of you
know each other's identity.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.213
Smart.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.959
Or not so smart.

11:02.190 --> 11:03.828
Undercover?
You can't go undercover.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.020
We don't even know who
you'll be working with.

11:05.060 --> 11:07.392
That's the point. Nobody on
Kilborn's crew knows each other.

11:07.430 --> 11:09.819
I show up at that hotel room,
I'm Eve.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.861
That's risky,
even for us.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.936
Okay, Al, you know
I can do this.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.858
I can. Tell me I'm wrong.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.801
I hope you're not wrong.
I hired you to be right.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.139
I'm going undercover
on Kilborn's crew-- as Eve.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.102
Who says, exactly?

11:24.150 --> 11:26.448
We say. Listen,

11:26.480 --> 11:28.914
Kilborn's crew is made up
completely of strangers.

11:28.950 --> 11:31.783
I show up at that hotel room,
I am Eve.

11:31.820 --> 11:32.912
Yeah, but what about Kilborn?
He'll know--

11:32.960 --> 11:36.009
he hired her-- you'll be dead
the minute you show up.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.357
No, no-- all of our intel says

11:37.390 --> 11:38.982
Kilborn doesn't show up
until the payoff.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.124
I can handle myself. I can.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.368
Besides, I even look...
kind of like Eve.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.938
Eliot, you want Kilborn,
this is the best way.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.336
So, you agree?

11:51.370 --> 11:52.906
No, I don't.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.271
What?

11:54.310 --> 11:55.504
You don't look like Eve.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.178
You're much better-looking.
Aw...

11:57.210 --> 11:59.098
_ Here's how
It goes down.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.310
Eve's due
at the Alcazar

12:00.350 --> 12:01.476
in two hours.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.181
We play it one step
at a time.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.984
Carrie doesn't go deeper
till we know she's in the clear.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.056
Anything hinky, we're done.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.257
All right.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.224
But I want eyes on her
at all times.

12:12.260 --> 12:13.898
Put your team together.

12:13.930 --> 12:16.023
Thank you.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.022
You know who
we're dealing with.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.867
Anything goes wrong,

12:20.900 --> 12:21.969
you won't see it coming.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.400
That's what I have you for.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.875
Hey.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.875
How's it going?

12:35.920 --> 12:36.887
Hey.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.239
Oh, just learning
everything

12:38.290 --> 12:40.781
I can about Eve.
MURRAY:
Hmm.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.084
On a personal and
molecular level, I see.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.882
Oh, that?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.283
Yeah, well, apparently

12:46.330 --> 12:49.049
_ she _was a chemical
engIneerIng major In college.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.261
Wow, you're
a pretty quick study.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.939
It kind of comes with the...

12:53.970 --> 12:55.790
...the territory.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.068
So you just...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.930
you look at it, and-and...

12:58.970 --> 13:00.506
and, what,
it just goes right in?

13:00.540 --> 13:03.577
Yeah, that's pretty...
that's pretty much it.
Whew.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.043
Wow. I can't even remember

13:05.080 --> 13:06.308
what my daughter wants
for dinner tonight.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.883
Hey, listen,
there's some stuff, uh...

13:10.920 --> 13:13.013
that we heard about Kilborn
at the Bureau.

13:13.060 --> 13:17.258
Some things he did to people
who crossed him.

13:17.290 --> 13:20.020
Just be careful, okay?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.028
Yeah. Okay.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.197
Thank you.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.439
This is for you.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.961
A barrette? That's not my style.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.500
It's Eve's style.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.031
Okay, but no one wears
barrettes anymore.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.969
Jay loaded a transmitter
in there-- it's got GPS, too--

13:38.010 --> 13:40.570
so we can follow and_ listen in
on all you're domg.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.545
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.148
I've always been good
at role-playing,

13:46.190 --> 13:47.452
in case you forgot.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.355
Believe me, I've tried to.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.187
Why? You make
a very sew pirate.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.450
Hey, guys.
They're in place at Alcazar.

13:57.330 --> 14:00.629
Anything feels off,
we pull you out.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.297
No need to be a hero.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.503
Since when have I ever tried
to be a hero?

14:52.350 --> 14:54.056
Is this is a "you show me yours
and I'll show you mine"

14:54.090 --> 14:55.387
kind of thing? 'Cause if it is,

14:55.420 --> 14:56.921
you're gonna be waiting
a long time,

14:56.960 --> 14:58.359
but I bet you're used to that,
aren't you?

14:58.390 --> 14:59.379
Who the hell are you?

14:59.430 --> 15:01.193
I can't tell you that.

15:01.230 --> 15:02.492
Don't you know the rules?

15:02.530 --> 15:05.021
Put that away.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.163
_ Pardon the
dIscourteous welcome.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.339
We weren't expecting
someone so refined.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.361
Mm.

15:17.210 --> 15:18.643
What's a-a five-letter word

15:18.680 --> 15:22.309
for "trout basket"
startIng WIth a...

15:22.350 --> 15:23.510
Whoa, um...

15:23.550 --> 15:25.211
Y-You're a...

15:25.250 --> 15:27.354
y-you're a...
Sh-She's...

15:27.390 --> 15:29.017
What's the matter?
Is it the first time

15:29.060 --> 15:30.322
in a hotel room with a woman?

15:31.490 --> 15:33.253
It's, um, a pleasure
to meet you.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.951
I'm...
No names.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.194
I'm not dying 'cause
of your disregard

15:37.230 --> 15:39.266
for Mr. Kilborn's rules.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.459
I don't like this.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.398
Those guys are armed
and volatile.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.203
She's doing great.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.708
How's the tracking
from her barrette?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.240
It's a strong signal.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.440
Good.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.687
Uh, so, I-I hacked

16:02.720 --> 16:04.551
into the hotel's
system, and, uh,

16:04.590 --> 16:06.626
all minibar charges
are going to room 1243.

16:06.660 --> 16:07.729
But, get this--

16:07.760 --> 16:11.560
there is no room 1243.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.238
So what are we supposed
to do, huh?

16:13.270 --> 16:14.692
Sit and wait?

16:14.740 --> 16:17.208
Do you roll over as well?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.707
And what are you?

16:18.740 --> 16:20.628
Like, the team masseuse
or something?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.136
In your dreams.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.770
He's an irascible fellow,
isn't he?

16:24.810 --> 16:26.778
Though I, too, am curious
about your bona fides.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.641
Well, I'm the chemist.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.513
I mix things and cause mayhem.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.778
Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:32.820 --> 16:36.187
Why don't you come over here and
mix me a drink then, Chemist.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.690
Sure.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.061
I'll make you a drink.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.089
What's your poison?

17:04.750 --> 17:06.081
Ah!

17:06.120 --> 17:07.678
Dinner.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.827
He's probably delivering
instructions of some kind.

17:11.860 --> 17:14.351
_ Kilborn knows
hIs crew's assembled.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.595
Well, he must be
watching the hotel.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.768
Get me photos of everyone
in the lobby.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.835
He's got to be nearby.

17:21.870 --> 17:22.837
MAN :
Copy that.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.508
Oh.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.758
Fnends?

17:33.580 --> 17:35.810
Play it.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.784
Who made you boss?

17:41.660 --> 17:43.287
Uh, right.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.457
MAN :
Welcome.

17:45.490 --> 17:49.756
Great adventure and wealth
await the four of you.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.724
But only if you do
exactly as I say.

17:52.770 --> 17:55.534
You know what will happen
to you if you don't.

17:55.570 --> 17:59.700
Your anonymity protects you,
so I've assigned you aliases.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.777
They are,
based on your order of arrival:

18:02.810 --> 18:05.404
Arnold, Willis,

18:05.450 --> 18:08.374
Philip and Pearl.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.611
Really

18:11.650 --> 18:12.787
You'll find boxes _ _
under the trolley contaInIng

18:12.820 --> 18:16.153
all you need for now.
A word of advice:

18:16.190 --> 18:17.885
keep your identities close.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.148
They're your best friends.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.451
How'd he know
we were all here?

18:21.500 --> 18:23.161
Because he's watching us.
CARRIE:
Apparently

18:23.200 --> 18:24.895
he's been watching
Diff'rent Strokes, too.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.433
"All further instructions
WIll come

18:29.470 --> 18:31.131
"on these phones.
Next communication

18:31.170 --> 18:33.730
in the morning."

18:33.780 --> 18:35.202
I suggest we all head
to our rooms

18:35.240 --> 18:36.434
and lay low for the evening.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.143
Well, you can come bunk with me
if you care to, sweetheart.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.740
Let me clarify what I do,
Willis.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.816
I create explosives,

18:44.850 --> 18:47.887
corrosive substances, poisons.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.487
Chloral hydrate.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.827
Even the smallest amount

18:52.860 --> 18:55.499
will create seizures,
hallucinations,

18:55.530 --> 18:57.498
loss of bowel control.

18:57.530 --> 19:00.431
Four drops will kill you.
I put two in your drink.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.836
Or maybe
it was three.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.360
Here-- let me do you a favor.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.901
This is_ the number
for p0Ison control.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.404
You don't look so good, buddy.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.877
Give me the number.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.571
Give me
the number.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.245
Give me the number!

19:14.280 --> 19:16.339
I didn't poison you, numbnuts.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.842
Don't mess with me again.

19:19.890 --> 19:23.189
Excuse me. I'm going to bed now.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.289
Pearl...

19:25.330 --> 19:27.298
is a bad-ass.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.719
: Yes, Mr. Arnold,
she most certainly is.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.733
I'm in.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.736
Morning, Jay.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.338
All's quiet
at the Alcazar.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.870
You look into
the hotel rooms?

19:45.910 --> 19:48.219
Booked by a dummy corporation
out of the Caymans.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.411
I was, however, able to match
the IDS of these three

19:50.450 --> 19:53.817
from stills Murray pulled
at the hotel security cameras.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.580
Let me introduce you
to Clay Stites, aka Philip.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.554
Born in Brixton, England, in and
out of Europe's finest prisons.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.352
He enjoys booze, assault
and armed robbery.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.493
His experience will probably
make him team leader.

20:04.530 --> 20:05.929
Next up is Willis,

20:05.970 --> 20:08.336
real name Andy Fotre;
former Army Ranger.

20:08.370 --> 20:11.339
Dishonorably discharged five
years ago for selling steroids.

20:11.370 --> 20:14.533
He has a long sheet, mostly
for home invasion and assault.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.933
Total loose cannon.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.574
And this guy?
Tucker Griffin.
We know him as Arnold.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.647
Has a lot of charges for
online fraud and hacking.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.578
NSA investigated him

20:22.620 --> 20:24.315
for penetrating
Department of Defense files,

20:24.350 --> 20:25.988
but couldn't get
anything to stick.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.454
Tech kid's a whiz,
but he's pretty green.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.924
Carrie will pick up on that
and try to work him.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.292
Keep digging.
You got it.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.423
CARRIE:
All right, so I send the gas
through the vents,

20:35.460 --> 20:37.690
we clear out the cash
and we spIIt.

20:37.730 --> 20:38.924
In and out in four mikes.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.939
Any sign of heat-- beat cop,
police cruiser, unmarked car--

20:41.970 --> 20:45.804
we take hostages.
A little collateral damage
never hurt anybody.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.068
Well, hopefully it
doesn't come to that.

20:47.110 --> 20:49.806
You lose your nerve in there,
and I will put a bullet in you.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.673
Hey. We're all pros
here, Willis.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.871
Arnold just wants to make
sure the job goes right.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.012
One of us will receive
our escape plan

20:56.050 --> 20:58.814
right before we hit the bank.
Another one will learn

20:58.850 --> 21:01.387
our rendezvous point with
Kilborn after we do the job.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.456
Why can't we just
get all the info now?

21:03.490 --> 21:05.526
Because if I had
all the info,

21:05.560 --> 21:07.755
I'd kill you three
and keep the money.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.994
PHILIP: Everyone lay low
until tomorrow.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.793
Don't forget your goodie bags.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.390
Get some rest.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.692
WILLIS: All right... bring your
A

21:17.710 --> 21:21.077
Yes... we have...

21:21.110 --> 21:23.374
here.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.708
Oh.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.911
Well, this is, uh...
this is a prototype.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.315
How'd he get this?

21:29.350 --> 21:31.944
Oh! Hey, that's, uh,
sinister-looking.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.082
Please don't use it on me.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.088
I make no promises.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.884
Arnold,
are you sure

21:37.930 --> 21:40.490
you're not in over your
hacker head with all of this?

21:40.530 --> 21:43.499
I'm kind of nervous, yeah.
Uh, this is, uh,

21:43.530 --> 21:46.021
my first time committing a crime
away from my computer.

21:46.070 --> 21:48.789
Well, how'd you get
on Kilborn's radar?

21:48.840 --> 21:50.967
Uh, hacked
the wrong offshore account.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.638
Mm!
Just my luck.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.103
Hey, um...

21:56.140 --> 21:58.449
how 'bout we look out
for each other?

21:58.480 --> 22:01.369
Willis and Philip
give me the creeps.
Yeah.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.980
They kind of give me
the creeps, too.

22:05.050 --> 22:07.814
Yeah.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.886
Carrie says the target's
a Hudson Mutual branch

22:10.930 --> 22:12.750
on Chambers Street
tomorrow afternoon.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.429
When does Kilborn show? He's got
to get his money at some point.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.052
We're tracking Carrie.
She'll lead us to him

22:17.100 --> 22:18.192
after they rob the bank.

22:18.230 --> 22:20.630
What about the customers
and the employees In the bank?

22:20.670 --> 22:22.035
We can't risk civilians.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.038
Only NYPD plainclothes
will be in there.

22:24.070 --> 22:26.038
This thing goes bad,
the mayor's

22:26.070 --> 22:28.573
gonna have me overseeing
parking meters in Staten Island.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.749
It goes right,
you collar Kilborn.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.577
All right.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.445
JAY: Hey, Al,
I got his finger.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.788
Whose finger?
Kilborn's finger. At least
I think it's his finger.

22:40.820 --> 22:41.855
Um, you know...
Okay, Jay,

22:41.890 --> 22:43.926
take a breath.
Right, right, right.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.520
So, I created
a little random data program

22:46.560 --> 22:48.721
and looked into collateral
crimes around the time

22:48.760 --> 22:50.398
of known Kilborn jobs--

22:50.430 --> 22:53.069
you know, stolen vehicles,
unexplained homicides-- anyways,

22:53.100 --> 22:54.067
came up with this.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.863
A finger.
Kilborn's finger.

22:55.900 --> 22:56.969
Maybe.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.001
I found this dead guy,
Bob Archer,

22:58.040 --> 23:00.770
who was involved in one
of Kilborn's first jobs.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.028
This picture was taken
off of Archer's cell phone

23:03.080 --> 23:05.446
six hours after the
port heist in San Pedro.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.619
It's possible
Kilborn's blocking the photo.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.675
And now you want me to
send out a FINEST message

23:09.720 --> 23:13.178
for a finger?
Now I want to give you
the finger... print.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.653
See, got this killer
new software

23:14.690 --> 23:16.180
that can generate prints
from photos.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.085
If we can match it to a print
in the system, we got him.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.779
I like it, Jay.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.458
Keep at it.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.491
AL:
Look at this.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.538
Well, Serpico in the flesh.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.868
You sure
it's safe to meet?
Yeah.

23:32.910 --> 23:35.174
I took the N train to Times
Square, picked up the A

23:35.210 --> 23:37.644
at Port Authority and
took the 7 to the M3 bus

23:37.680 --> 23:39.978
and back down here-- Mata Hari
couldn't have followed me.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.841
You're enjoying this
a little too much.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.984
No. Well, a little bit.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.581
"Upon my secure hour
thy uncle stole,

23:47.620 --> 23:50.157
"With juice
from cursed hebenon in a vial,

23:50.190 --> 23:52.488
"And in the porches
of my ear did pour,

23:52.530 --> 23:54.725
The leperous distilment."

23:54.760 --> 23:56.990
Hamlet. Act 1, Scene 5?

23:57.030 --> 24:00.636
I was Ophelia in school.
Bet you got raves.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.558
Oh, speaking of poison,

24:02.600 --> 24:05.433
the gas you got
from Kilborn, Fentanyl.

24:06.810 --> 24:09.131
The gas that killed all those
people in the Moscow theater.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.502
Oh, my God.
So I replaced the Fentanyl

24:12.550 --> 24:14.973
with Halothane.
It's a much lower level toxin,

24:15.020 --> 24:16.749
and it should knock
the guards out.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.088
Okay.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.008
Remember, Jay's got you
on audio the whole time

24:20.050 --> 24:21.119
from your wire,

24:21.160 --> 24:23.628
and Murray will be right
behind you in a follow car.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.083
No. Kilborn is way
too smart for that.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.758
You got to keep her back,
as far back as possible.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.597
She can follow
me on GPS, okay?

24:30.630 --> 24:32.598
Like I said, anything feels bad,

24:32.630 --> 24:34.791
I'm calling it.
We'll pull you out.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.263
Al, you...
you're my hero.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.007
I'm gonna put that on a T-shirt.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.579
The fact that the two of you are
still not doing it is beyond me.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.245
PHILIP: Gents
and fair lady, our chariot.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.252
WOMAN :
Sounds like they're

24:55.290 --> 24:56.484
getting into a transport.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.864
MURRAY:
I've got 'em on the move.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.562
JAY: Where are you, Al?
They're rolling.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.566
Okay, I'm in the park
across from the bank.

25:12.610 --> 25:13.736
Keep me posted.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.237
They're on their way.

25:18.980 --> 25:23.883
Aren't you afraid some witness
is gonna... remember your hair?

25:23.920 --> 25:26.809
Watching out for me.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.852
Yeah.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.021
Yeah.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.290
Give me that.

25:37.330 --> 25:39.821
Kilborn said no personal
items during the job.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.667
This?

25:41.700 --> 25:43.236
It's a barrette, Willis.
I don't care.

25:43.270 --> 25:45.306
Oh, no.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.979
This falls out, it's got
your DNA all over it.

25:48.010 --> 25:52.140
And I am not going down 'cause
you can't follow instructions.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.114
I've lost her. No audio. Murray?

25:59.150 --> 26:00.310
Tracking's gone.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.317
I don't have her.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.255
No one wears barrettes
anymore anyway, rIght?

26:21.710 --> 26:24.008
We're set in the bank.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.108
Okay, listen to me.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.344
Nobody's a hero today.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.348
The faster we let his crew
finish the job,

26:28.380 --> 26:30.211
the closer we are
to gettIng KIlborn

26:30.250 --> 26:33.754
and getting Carrie out
of harm's way. Yeah.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.729
What do you mean
the wire's gone?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.648
Willis tossed it.
I've got no GPS signal.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.668
Hold on. It's Jay.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.019
Jay, talk to me.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.890
We got to find that van.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.898
Yeah. Hold on, hold on.
I got something.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.636
Uh, Carrie very wisely gave me
the number to her burner cell.

26:51.670 --> 26:53.103
IfI can just find it.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.835
Hold on. Come on.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.178
Come to Jay. Come on.

26:57.210 --> 27:00.077
Yes, they're at 9th and 26th,
heading downtown.

27:01.680 --> 27:02.749
I'm on my way.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.671
All right, they're about
ten blocks ahead of me.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.838
I'm guessing ETA at the bank
about ten minutes.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.417
Okay, stay with them.
We're ready.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.880
Hope nobody wants
to phone their mums.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.057
I'm jamming everything

27:41.090 --> 27:43.058
within 50
feet of the van.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.888
Kilborn wants to make sure
our cells aren't traced.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.898
Um...

27:47.930 --> 27:50.694
I'm-I'm not feeling good
about this.

27:50.730 --> 27:53.267
I'd be worried if you were,
Mr. Arnold.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.931
What the hell just happened?

27:58.970 --> 28:00.938
VVhat
I don't know.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.299
We just lost the trace
on Carrie's burner.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.740
I had her on Varick,
then she just vanished.

28:04.780 --> 28:06.304
Murray, you have a visual?

28:06.350 --> 28:08.910
Negaﬁve.
Okay, if she was just on Varick,

28:08.950 --> 28:11.885
they got to be here any minute.
We play it according to plan.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.717
Remember,
no interference.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.751
Let 'em in, let 'em out.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.319
Wh
Are we turnIng around?

28:24.370 --> 28:25.928
Following Mr. Kilborn's
instructions.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.267
He changed the target.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.961
What?!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.809
That's tactical suicide.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.432
The location he gave us
yesterday was bogus.

28:32.470 --> 28:33.437
We'll execute

28:33.470 --> 28:36.439
the same plan.
Okay, um... N-No.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.243
I'm-I'm not going along
with this.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.443
You most certainly will go
along with it, Mr. Arnold.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.846
Only the utility closet
and counting room

28:43.890 --> 28:45.209
specs are different.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.945
You'll find new
schematIcs under

28:46.990 --> 28:49.117
the passenger seat,
so I suggest you study up.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.219
By the way,

28:51.260 --> 28:52.887
payday just got bigger.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.750
$8 million.

28:57.330 --> 29:00.026
Nice day to rob a bank.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.938
They should've
been here by now.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.268
It's almost 4:50.
The bank closes in ten minutes.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.959
Something's wrong.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.238
Jay, any luck?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.374
Nothing yet. I'm working on it.
I'll find her, I'll find her.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.970
I think he switched
targets on us.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.842
All right, Jay, get helicopters,
traffic cops--

29:17.890 --> 29:20.188
anyone with a badge--
looking for that van.

29:20.220 --> 29:22.984
They're about
to hit something.
Al, I hate to say it,

29:23.020 --> 29:26.183
but if Kilborn
did change targets...
I know.

29:26.230 --> 29:29.222
It means Carrie
may have been made.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.042
What the hell?
Burns says we lost them?

29:45.080 --> 29:48.243
Not to worry, boss.
And we have no idea what bank
they're about to hit?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.077
Like I said...
Jay, thIs Is not worry

29:50.120 --> 29:52.213
you are hearing in my voice.
This is a very powerful

29:52.250 --> 29:54.150
and very justified anxiety.
Like I said,

29:54.190 --> 29:55.282
you shouldn't worry
because remember

29:55.320 --> 29:56.981
when I asked you
to call in that favor

29:57.020 --> 29:58.328
for that cell phone/Wi-Fi grid
from Homeland?

29:58.360 --> 30:00.487
IfI recall correctly,
it involved getting

30:00.530 --> 30:03.226
the Deputy Director four very
exclusive dinner reservations.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.522
Well, it's a good thing
we got it.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.265
Why?
You tracking a cyber attack?

30:06.300 --> 30:07.392
Not exactly. In this case,

30:07.430 --> 30:09.136
I'm tracking
the sudden loss

30:09.170 --> 30:10.592
of cell phone service.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.164
You see that string
of black pearls, boss?

30:12.210 --> 30:15.179
Each pearl represents an
area of lost cell coverage.

30:15.210 --> 30:16.939
Which means?

30:16.980 --> 30:18.447
Which means reception's
being knocked out sequentially

30:18.480 --> 30:19.447
across Houston,

30:19.480 --> 30:21.516
and I think Kilborn's doing it.

30:21.550 --> 30:24.246
So we follow the outages
and we follow the van.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.939
Whew. Nice.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.083
So... do I get
a dinner reservation?

30:28.120 --> 30:29.553
Oh, you...

30:29.590 --> 30:31.455
you get a...
you get a protein bar.

30:31.490 --> 30:34.823
Enjoy it.
Nice. Yeah, thanks.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.964
All right, tech boy,
you're up.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.467
Wish me luck.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.536
Luck.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.991
Hey!

31:08.030 --> 31:09.452
Everybody get down!

31:09.500 --> 31:11.161
Not worth
the 12 quid an hour, old timer.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.667
Move it! Go! Move it!

31:12.700 --> 31:14.531
Get down!

31:14.570 --> 31:16.367
PHILIP: Go! Move it!
Open the door!

31:16.400 --> 31:19.130
WILLIS: I said get down!
Nobody move!

31:19.170 --> 31:20.159
Everybody out now!

31:20.210 --> 31:21.632
Move, move, move!

31:21.680 --> 31:24.069
You, get on the ground!

31:24.110 --> 31:25.941
All of you on the ground!

31:25.980 --> 31:28.119
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're New Yorkers.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.913
You know how this works.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.247
Now, I wish you no harm.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.178
But my associate
here is salivating

31:33.220 --> 31:37.054
at the thought of butchering
every last one of you.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.058
So nobody do anything dodgy.

31:39.090 --> 31:41.126
All right,
toss all your phones.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.493
Every phone on the ground now!

31:44.530 --> 31:47.966
PHILIP: Now, we'd like a word
with the bank manager.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.230
You, come.

31:56.110 --> 31:58.544
JAY: Okay, the outages
stop heading downtown

31:58.580 --> 31:59.478
on Broadway
around Broome street.

31:59.510 --> 32:01.569
Check for reports
of suspicious activity

32:01.620 --> 32:03.315
at any banks in the area.

32:03.350 --> 32:04.282
Copy that.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.119
Open the door.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.069
You sure you know
which one it is?

32:28.110 --> 32:30.203
If memory serves.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.207
Here.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.979
Okay.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.613
Gas is moving.

32:43.660 --> 32:44.979
PHIL_IP :
Two mInutes!

32:45.030 --> 32:47.021
Time to get rich.

32:47.490 --> 32:50.129
Here.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.706
JA_Y:
No reports of SIIent alarms or
suspicious activity anywhere.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.274
I mean, I got
a carbon monoxide alarm

33:08.320 --> 33:09.776
at a bank over on Centre,
butthatsit

33:09.820 --> 33:10.775
What's that last one?

33:10.820 --> 33:13.618
Uh, some carbon monoxide
detector going haywire.

33:13.650 --> 33:14.787
Where's the branch?

33:14.820 --> 33:16.617
On Centre
between Broome and Grand.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.423
Carrie knows these sensors
route through EMS

33:18.460 --> 33:19.484
and police channels.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.554
Get that out to units.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.195
She's sending up a flare.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.194
Time to go.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.764
ARNOLD:
I'm out of here!

33:31.810 --> 33:34.233
Your job was
to kill both of them.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.633
He'll be dead in five minutes.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.500
I did my job.

33:37.540 --> 33:40.247
You better make sure,
'cause he's seen our faces.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.009
Do him.

33:50.490 --> 33:51.821
It's gonna be all right.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.590
ARNOLD:
Pearl, let's go!

33:54.630 --> 33:56.154
Let's go!

33:56.200 --> 33:58.259
We got what we came for.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.359
Let's go.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.364
Arnold!

34:24.230 --> 34:25.629
That was amateur hour
with the gas.

34:25.660 --> 34:26.854
You took care of that guard,

34:26.890 --> 34:29.552
yeah?
What do you think?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.659
Oh, come on, man.
She blew his head off!

34:33.270 --> 34:34.532
What are we doing?

34:34.570 --> 34:35.594
We are ditching.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.164
Kilborn's orders.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.736
We leave everything
but the money.

34:38.770 --> 34:41.273
Come on, come on, move, move!

34:51.350 --> 34:52.578
All the money from banks damaged

34:52.620 --> 34:53.814
by Hurricane Sandy
was kept here.

34:53.850 --> 34:54.817
They cleared it out.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.213
Took off in a delivery van.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.284
Nobody got plates.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.127
What direction
was it heading?

34:58.160 --> 35:00.481
_We're still
questIonIng WItnesses.

35:00.530 --> 35:03.397
JAY:
Al, you there?

35:03.430 --> 35:04.590
Forensics just matched
a fingerprint

35:04.630 --> 35:05.858
off of Kilborn's photo.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.095
Uploading to you simultaneously.

35:13.270 --> 35:15.238
Holy...

35:15.280 --> 35:16.406
Al, you seeing this?

35:18.510 --> 35:20.501
Arnold's Kilborn.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.759
Hey, unis found the van

35:40.800 --> 35:42.392
in an alley
a few blocks away, torched.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.237
The burner cells were inside.
No street cams.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.339
Of course not.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.167
So we have no idea what
direction they're headed?

35:47.210 --> 35:48.177
Nope.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.370
WOMAN:
Excuse me?

35:49.410 --> 35:51.241
Excuse me-- can we get
our phones back?

35:51.280 --> 35:53.202
I need to tell
my rIde to ﬁre Island

35:53.250 --> 35:54.342
you're making me late.
Sorry, ma'am.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.439
We have to keep
them for evidence.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.853
Everybody come claim
your cell phones!

36:06.890 --> 36:08.528
Come on, come and get them.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.289
Come on.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.195
Come get them.

36:13.830 --> 36:16.492
I just hope Carrie's as clever
as I think she is.

36:16.540 --> 36:19.361
My cell phone is not here.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.271
Your phone's not here?
No.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.800
None of these cell phones is
your phone?
No!

36:25.850 --> 36:27.909
Come here, come here.
All right.

36:27.950 --> 36:29.349
Carrie took her phone.

36:29.380 --> 36:30.870
Have Jay track it.
Get me the location.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.239
I'm going after Carrie.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.643
MURRAY:
Come on, let's go.

36:33.690 --> 36:36.250
So who knows where
the meet

36:36.290 --> 36:37.609
It's not far.

36:37.660 --> 36:40.322
Let's load up
and shove off.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.351
There.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.449
All right.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.474
So, Kilborn has
one more demand.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.919
We toss our weapons
before we meet him.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.542
I know, I know.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.751
Paranoia, right?

37:08.790 --> 37:10.758
There is no way I'm going
in there unstrapped.

37:10.790 --> 37:11.984
He can't be serious.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.986
Listen, we-we've got
the leverage here.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.554
We've got Kilborn's money.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.692
I'm not giving up my gun.

37:16.730 --> 37:17.822
I think

37:17.860 --> 37:19.361
tossing our pieces

37:19.400 --> 37:21.493
for a few million bucks is fair.

37:25.870 --> 37:28.373
PHILIP: How do we know
he's not carryIng?

37:28.410 --> 37:30.776
WILLIS:
Yeah, that's right.

37:30.810 --> 37:34.041
What's a five-letter word
for "trout basket"

37:34.080 --> 37:36.014
starting with a...

37:37.480 --> 37:39.380
WILLIS:
That doesn't sound right.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.819
I-I hear you, fellas.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.717
But let's not
make Kilborn upset.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.059
Angry beasts tend to bite.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.524
...five-letter word
for "trout basket"

37:49.560 --> 37:51.664
starting with a...

37:51.700 --> 37:54.863
Whoa, um, uh, you're-you're a...

37:54.900 --> 37:57.460
We got what we came for.
Let's go.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.602
Okay, look, look.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.528
No one will work
for Kilborn again

38:01.580 --> 38:02.899
if he waxes us.

38:02.940 --> 38:03.907
Hey, we'll be fine.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.770
Whoa.

38:04.810 --> 38:05.902
Don't...

38:05.950 --> 38:07.042
give up your weapons.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.741
Arnold is a cop.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.748
Hey, don't mess around, Pearl!

38:10.780 --> 38:12.589
What are you talking about?

38:12.620 --> 38:15.487
No, there is no way that
this wuss is five-oh.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.750
I'm telling you, he's a cop.

38:17.790 --> 38:19.428
That is crazy.

38:19.460 --> 38:20.927
I am not a cop.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.791
I am the hacker.

38:22.830 --> 38:24.366
Okay, for all we know

38:24.400 --> 38:26.095
Pearl's the cop.

38:26.130 --> 38:27.324
I covered for her earlier.

38:27.370 --> 38:29.759
She didn't...
shoot that guard.

38:40.010 --> 38:42.513
You weren't expecting me
to give a loaded gun to a cop,

38:42.550 --> 38:45.087
now, were you?

38:45.120 --> 38:47.111
That's why you wouldn't
let me shoot the guard.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.913
I would have realized
they were blanks.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.757
I would've realized
that you made me, huh?

38:50.790 --> 38:53.122
I designed those rounds myself,
by the way.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.958
It sure was sweet

38:56.000 --> 38:58.525
of you to save me
from that bullet.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.664
I'll be sure to tell your bosses
that you deserve a medal.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.735
Posthumously, of course.

39:02.770 --> 39:05.898
And you could spare the guard

39:05.940 --> 39:07.635
'cause he never saw your face.

39:07.670 --> 39:08.932
You came back with your mask on.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.904
Bravo, Carrie.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.010
I wasn't expecting you
to put all that together.

39:15.050 --> 39:16.608
But you didn't expect me

39:16.650 --> 39:18.618
to make you in the hotel,
now, did you?

39:18.650 --> 39:20.845
We didn't know you'd
be on the team.

39:20.890 --> 39:23.859
I'm always on the team.

39:23.890 --> 39:27.053
And at that point, it was
either walk away or improvise.

39:27.090 --> 39:28.955
And using you to fool the cops

39:29.000 --> 39:31.025
was way too much fun to pass up.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.528
So what am I now? Just, um...

39:33.570 --> 39:35.390
insurance?

39:35.440 --> 39:36.998
For your getaway?

39:37.040 --> 39:40.567
In the very unlikely case
that your friends show up.

39:40.610 --> 39:42.077
Of course...

39:42.110 --> 39:45.443
I can kill you

39:45.480 --> 39:47.778
right now.

39:49.620 --> 39:50.917
Creel.

39:50.950 --> 39:52.144
Excuse me?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.613
A five-letter word
for "trout basket."

39:54.660 --> 39:55.752
Cute.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.628
Now get over there...

39:58.660 --> 40:01.754
AL:
Throw your gun down, Kilborn!

40:03.530 --> 40:06.465
Let us drive out of here
or I smoke her!

40:14.510 --> 40:15.602
WILLIS:
And what are you,

40:15.640 --> 40:17.631
like, the team masseuse
or something?

40:17.680 --> 40:21.548
Why don't you come over here
and mix me a drink, Chemist?

40:21.580 --> 40:24.481
Seriously, she is dead in three
seconds if you don't...

40:26.150 --> 40:27.686
Son of a...!

40:31.060 --> 40:32.687
(Carrie panting,
Arnold groaning in pain)

40:34.190 --> 40:36.226
Aah! Son of a...

40:40.830 --> 40:43.731
Ah, I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.101
Had a bank robbery to look into.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.131
Yeah.
Plus there's a phone thief
on the loose.

40:47.170 --> 40:50.003
Come on.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.747
ARNOLD: I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

40:52.780 --> 40:56.147
You know, Arnold the Terrified
Nerd kind of worked for me.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.683
Arnold the Master Criminal,
not so much.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.687
OFFICER:
All right, let's go.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.884
AL: It's gonna be nice
having Carrie Wells back.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.682
Oh, I don't know.

41:06.730 --> 41:07.754
I'm gonna kind of miss Pearl.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.894
Bad girls have all the fun.

41:09.930 --> 41:12.797
I knew you'd enjoy being on the
other side of a heist for once.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.058
For once?

41:14.100 --> 41:15.692
Think this is the first
bank I've robbed?

41:15.740 --> 41:17.230
Give me a date,
just a date.

41:17.270 --> 41:19.067
So you can look it up?
So I can arrest you.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.532
I dare ya.

41:20.570 --> 41:21.798
You know when you dare me,

41:21.840 --> 41:23.239
you always end up
buying me a drink.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.770
You want a drink?

41:24.810 --> 41:25.777
Sure.

41:25.810 --> 41:26.640
Why didn't you say so?

41:26.680 --> 41:27.601
I'll buy you a...
I'll buy you two.
